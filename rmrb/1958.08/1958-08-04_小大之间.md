    Between Small and Large
    Chen Zhiyan
    The General Line includes a provision called simultaneous development of large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises. People are used to calling this a combination of large, medium, and small.
    Facts have proven that this policy is very much in line with our country's actual conditions, and its benefits have been prominently demonstrated in just a few months: the initiative of local authorities and the masses has been mobilized, industry has emerged in every corner of the country, and productivity has developed at high speed.
    The source of all these benefits is related to the word "small." But to this day, there are still people who are not interested in "small." Some people verbally agree, but deep down they feel awkward. "Socialism is about modern large-scale production, so why bother with these small things?" The implication is that small means backward and shabby. In a word, small is not satisfying.
    Are comrades who are not interested in "small" and look down on "small things" completely wrong? It doesn't seem so. Originally, what's wrong with liking the "large" of socialism? Our country spans the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, with nearly ten million square kilometers of land; our population is the largest in the world. These are well-known facts. With a large land area and a large population, socialist construction must be large and non-large is not an option, it simply cannot solve the problem. Large dams, large steel plants, large power stations, large textile mills, and even large stadiums and large universities, etc., all should be, and must be, present. However, wanting large does not mean not wanting medium-sized, and even less does it mean not wanting small-sized. On the contrary, in order to carry out large-scale socialist construction and to maximize the scale of construction as much as possible, when making specific arrangements for construction projects, it is necessary to have both large, medium, and small. Under the current circumstances, it should be mainly small and medium-sized, especially small-sized. Only in this way will it conform to the current actual conditions of our country. Our country has a large land area, a large population, and abundant resources that are widely distributed, but the foundation is poor and needs to develop at a high speed. Without adopting the method of combining large, medium, and small, we cannot achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Those comrades who are not interested in "small" simply do not understand the reason. They like the "large" of socialism, which is unimpeachable, but they can be said to know nothing, or only half-know, about how to achieve "large." They firmly believe that only large-scale is reasonable and only large-scale is socialism. They do not understand that under certain conditions, medium-sized and small-sized are also reasonable and also called socialism. This is where their problem and weakness lies.
    Comrades with this kind of view generally have a metaphysical color in their way of thinking. In their view, small is small and large is large, and there is no inherent dialectical relationship between them, nor will there be any changes. But the objective reality is not like this.
    Small and large are not absolute in the first place.
    The sum of many small things is large. Please see that in the last six months, millions of small industries below the county level have been established. Each small industry, viewed individually, is really small: small and indigenous blast furnaces of 0.5 cubic meters, small power stations of one kilowatt driven by wooden water turbines, small oil refineries with a daily output of half a ton to one ton, small farm tool repair shops where several workers are also farmers... Compared with modern large-scale industry, these little guys are certainly not spectacular, but what does it matter? Small is the foundation of large, and countless small things constitute large. This is the large-scale development of local industry, the large-scale increase in industrial output value, and the large-scale popularization of industrial technology.
    The law of the development of things is often from small to large, from small to big, and from small things emerge great things. Whether it is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the Communist Party of China, they all developed from small Marxist groups. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and small does not mean weak. On the contrary, in many cases, small is the most vibrant. Some comrades superficially view those small enterprises from a static and unchanging point of view, rather than from a developmental point of view, and some comrades are out of touch with reality, so they always feel that small is uninteresting. The news published in today's newspaper that the Shijingshan Power Plant is contracting to build a giant power plant ten times larger than itself can give these comrades some inspiration: small can produce large.
    Of course, some small enterprises may remain small in the present and in the future. For example, some small industries in townships and communes serve the agricultural production and people's lives of their own townships and communes, and they do not need to develop very large. Their changes are mainly reflected in the quality aspect, such as gradually developing from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization.
    We very much like those modernized large enterprises. Tall and spacious factory buildings, high-speed automatic lathes that do not require people to manage them, large cranes running back and forth... they look really impressive. We have already built a batch in the past, and we will continue to build a considerable number of such large enterprises in the future, which are the backbone of our country's industrialization and agricultural modernization. However, based on the actual situation of our country, in a considerable period of time, and in a wider range, we must build more small and medium-sized, especially small-sized, enterprises, otherwise we will fall into one-sidedness. And one-sidedness is detrimental to socialist construction. Combining large, medium, and small is our line for running industry and running many other undertakings. This is our understanding of the correct relationship between small and large.

    小大之间
    陈之衍
    总路线中有一条叫做大型企业和中小型企业同时并举。人们习惯地把这叫做大中小相结合。
    事实证明，这个方针很切合我们国家的实际，在短短几个月的时间中，它的好处表现得很突出：地方和群众的积极性被动员出来了，工业在全国各个角落出现了，生产力高速度地发展了。
    这一切好处的来源，都和“小”字有关。可是偏偏到现在还有人对“小”不感兴趣。有的人嘴上赞成，心坎儿里觉得蹩扭。“社会主义么，现代化大生产么，为什么要弄那些小不点儿？”意思是小的就是寒仓、落后。一句话，小的不过瘾。
    对“小”的不感兴趣，瞧不起“小不点儿”的同志，是不是压根儿错了呢？似也不然。本来么，好社会主义之大又有何不可？我们的国家地跨寒温热三带，有将近一千万平方公里的土地；人口之众，冠于全球。这些都是尽人皆知的。地大，人多，仅仅凭这两条，搞社会主义建设就一定能大而且非大不可，不大就不解决问题。大水坝、大钢铁厂、大电站、大纺织厂以至于大运动场、大大学等等，都应当要都应当有。然而，要大的并不等于不要中的，更不等于不要小的。相反，为了大搞社会主义建设，和尽可能把建设的规模搞得大大的，在具体安排建设项目时，就必须既要大的又要中的又要小的。在目前情况下，还应当以中小特别是以小的为主。只有这样，才符合于我们国家当前的实际情况。我国地大、人多、资源多分布广，但是基础差而又需要高速度发展，不采取大中小相结合的办法，就不能多快好省。那些对“小”不感兴趣的同志，就是不明白其中道理。他们好社会主义之大，这是无懈可击的，可是对于如何大法，却可以说是一窍不通或者只通半窍。他们“笃定”地认为只有大型的才是合理的，才叫社会主义。而不懂得在一定的条件下，中型和小型也是合理的，也叫社会主义。这就是他们的毛病和弱点所在。
    有这种看法的同志，思想方法上大体上都带有形而上学的色彩。在他们看来，小就是小，大就是大，其中绝没有什么必然的辩证关系，也不会有什么变化。可是客观实际却不是这样。
    小和大本来就不是绝对的。
    许许多多小的总和就是大。请看最近半年的时间内，几百万个县以下的小工业办起来了，每个小工业单独看起来，真是小得可以：零点五立方公尺的小而又土的高炉、一个瓩的用木质水轮机带动的小电站、日产半吨到一吨的小炼油厂、几个是工人也是农民干活的小农具修理厂……。和近代大工业比起来，这些小家伙当然一点也不壮观，可是这又有什么关系呢？小是大的基础，无数的小构成了大。这就是地方工业大发展、工业产值大增长、工业技术大普及。
    事物发展的规律往往是先小后大、由小变大、小中出大。不论是苏联共产党也不论是中国共产党，都是从小小的马克思主义小组发展起来的。星星之火可以燎原，小并不等于弱。相反，在许多情况下，小的却是最富于生命力的。有的同志从表面上用静止的不变的观点而不是用发展的观点去看待那些小企业，加上有些同志脱离实际，因此总觉得小的没有味道。今天本报发表的石景山发电厂包建一个比它本身大十倍的巨型发电厂的消息，可以给这些同志一点启示：小的可以产生大的。
    当然，有些小的企业，在现在和将来，可能都是小的。比如乡和社的一些小工业，它就是为本乡本社的农业生产和人民生活服务，它不需要发展得很大。它的变化主要表现在质量方面，比如逐步由手工操作向半机械化、机械化方向发展。
    我们很喜欢那些近代化的大企业。高高的宽敞的厂房、转速很快而不需人在旁边料理的自动车床、来回奔跑的大吊车……，看起来也真带劲。我们过去已经建设了一批，今后还要建设相当数量的这样的大企业，这是我国工业化和农业现代化的骨干。可是从我国的实际出发，在相当的时间内，在更广阔的范围内，我们还必须更多地建设中小型的特别是小型的企业，否则就会陷入片面。而片面性是对社会主义建设不利的。大中小相结合这就是我们办工业和办其它许多事业的路线。这就是我们对小大之间的正确关系的一点认识。
