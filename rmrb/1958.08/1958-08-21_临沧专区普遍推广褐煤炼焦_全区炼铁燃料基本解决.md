According to Yunnan Daily, Lincang Prefecture in Yunnan Province, with the exception of Yun County, which lacks brown coal, has universally promoted brown coal coking. Among them, the three coal mines in Fengqing, Lincang, and Shuangjiang counties have already produced large quantities. By the end of this year, together with the Gengma coal mine, the four mines will produce 35,000 tons of brown coal coke, which can basically solve the fuel needed for the region's iron and steel industry.

Lincang Prefecture has extremely rich reserves of brown coal. However, in the past, the utilization rate of brown coal was not high, and many coal mines were not exploited. In March of this year, the workers of the Shuangjiang coal mine, under the leadership of the county party secretary and the director of the prefectural finance and trade department, began to experiment with brown coal coking. After continuous exploration, in the fourth experiment, the yield rate reached 20%, and the coke became ash-white. After testing with 80% brown coal coke and 20% charcoal for iron smelting, the firepower was more than 50% stronger than using charcoal alone, the ore melted normally, and the quality of the molten iron was good. Immediately afterward, Fengqing County learned from Shuangjiang's experience, and the quality of the coke produced exceeded that of Shuangjiang, with a coke yield of 50% per hundred catties of brown coal. In May of this year, the Lincang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized an on-site industrial meeting in Fengqing County for all counties in the region to vigorously promote brown coal coking.

The production process and equipment for brown coal coking are very simple, and earthen kilns used for burning charcoal can be used for coking. The coking method is to first crush the coal into large pieces of three to five kilograms, and then load it into the furnace for burning. From ignition to combustion, it takes five to six hours. When the coal is thoroughly burned, it no longer emits smoke, but sprays flames. The furnace door and smoke outlet are then sealed with stones and mud, and gradually cooled after extinguishing the fire to form coke.

　　临沧专区普遍推广褐煤炼焦
    全区炼铁燃料基本解决
    据云南日报报道  云南省临沧专区除没有褐煤的云县外，已普遍推广了褐煤炼焦。其中凤庆、临沧、双江等县的三个煤矿，已大量生产。到今年年底，加上耿马煤矿，四个矿将生产三万五千吨褐煤焦，全区钢铁工业所需燃料，可以基本上解决。
    临沧专区褐煤蕴藏量极其丰富。但过去褐煤利用率不高，很多煤矿也没有开采。今年3月，双江煤矿的职工，在县委书记、地委财贸部部长领导下，开始试验用褐煤炼焦。经过不断摸索，在第四次试验中，成品率达到20％，焦煤成灰白色。经过用80％的褐煤焦加20％的木炭炼铁试验，火力比全用木炭强50％以上，矿石熔化正常，铁水质量良好。紧接着凤庆县学习了双江的经验，炼出的焦煤质量超过双江，每百斤褐煤出焦率达到50％。今年5月，中共临沧地委组织全区各县在凤庆县召开工业现场会议，大力推广了褐煤炼焦。
    褐煤炼焦的生产过程及设备都很简单，采用烧木炭的土炉窑即可炼焦。炼焦的方法是先将煤敲碎至三到五公斤的大块，然后装炉烧炼。从点火到燃烧，需五至六小时。煤烧透时，不再出烟，而是喷出火焰，即用石块、泥土将炉门和出烟口密封，熄火后逐渐冷却即成焦。
