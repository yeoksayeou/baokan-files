Xinhua News Agency, August 1st - The leading organ of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today received a large number of triumphant telephone calls and telegrams from various units of the Railway Corps constructing railway networks on the vast land of the motherland. These reports of victory show that the Railway Corps is accelerating the pace of the motherland's railway construction with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping, and various road construction sites are celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day with practical actions of starting construction ahead of schedule and completing projects ahead of schedule.

The troops undertaking the Yunnan-Guizhou section of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau have already deployed their forces ahead of schedule in various sections and launched a battle to conquer high mountains, deep valleys, and swift currents. The troops undertaking the Weining-Rongfeng section, one of the key sections of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, have also started construction ahead of schedule. In many places rarely visited by humans and where tigers and leopards roam, clusters of tents and "new labor villages" have appeared. The troops fighting hard on the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway, inspired by the slogan of consolidating national defense and supporting the liberation of Taiwan, completed the key project of the Damuxi Bridge fifteen days ahead of schedule, exceeding the national quota in three items and saving more than 300,000 yuan. On July 20, the track-laying troops started laying tracks southward from Eyang Station, 98.9 kilometers away from Fuzhou, ten days ahead of the original plan. On the Leizhou Peninsula on the coastal defense front, the bridge, culvert, earthwork, and stonework of the Lianjiang-Maoming Railway have been completed two months ahead of schedule. The earth-filling projects for the Shahu Station and Zhongshan Bridge of the Wuhan Hub Station project are in full swing. The road construction troops of the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, which spans the Yellow River and crosses the desert, have joined forces with the railway workers of the southern section in Yinchuan five months ahead of schedule on the eve of "August 1st."

The Railway Corps is also presenting its achievements in vigorously carrying out technical revolutions and running industries as gifts to the "August 1st" Army Day. According to incomplete statistics, on the eve of "August 1st," the Railway Corps units exceeded the national quota 501 times, 1,777 times, and put forward a total of more than 17,600 rationalization proposals, inventions, and creations. Iron casting and steelmaking have become a hot trend in various units. The Fifth Company of a certain detachment started from scratch, used very simple equipment, and worked hard for several days and nights to smelt high-quality low-carbon steel. A certain unit successfully trial-produced cement and built a cement factory with an annual output of 3,000 tons. The oil pumps and nozzles trial-produced by the Railway Corps Machinery Repair Factory are also of good quality. (Attached picture)

    铁道兵各路大军
    加速筑路庆“八一”
    新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵领导机关今天收到在祖国辽阔的土地上编织铁道网的铁道兵各部队从施工现场发来的大批报捷的电话和电报。这些捷报表明铁道兵各部队正以万马奔腾之势加快祖国铁道建设的速度，各筑路工地纷纷以提前开工和提前竣工的实际行动庆祝“八一”建军节。
    在云贵高原担负闽滇大铁路滇黔线工程的部队，已提前在各段摆开阵势，展开了征服崇山峻岭、急流深谷的战斗。担任内（江）昆
  （明）铁路关键工段之一的威（宁）榕（峰）段工程的部队也提前动工。不少人迹罕到、虎豹横行的地方，出现了朵朵帐篷和一片片“劳动新村”。冒着盛暑奋战在南（平）福（州）铁路上的部队，在巩固国防、支援解放台湾的口号鼓舞下，提前十五天完成了重点工程大目溪大桥，突破国家定额三项，节约资金三十多万元。7月20日，铺轨部队比原计划提前十天，开始从距福州九十八点九公里的莪洋车站继续向南铺轨。海防前线雷州半岛上的廉（江）茂（名）铁路全线的桥涵、土石方工程已提前两个月完成。武汉枢纽站工程沙湖车站和中山桥填土工程正在紧张进行。横跨黄河、数越沙漠的包兰铁路北段筑路部队已提前五个月，在“八一”前夕与南段铁路工人胜利会师银川。
    铁道兵各路大军还以大搞技术革命、大办工业的成就作为向“八一”建军节的献礼。据不完全统计，在“八一”前夕，铁道兵部队共突破国家定额五百零一项，一千七百七十七次，提出的合理化建议及发明创造共有一万七千六百多件。铸铁炼钢在各部队已形成热潮。某支队五连白手起家，利用非常简陋的设备，苦战几昼夜，炼出了质量优良的低炭钢。某部队试制水泥成功，并自建一座年产三千吨的水泥工厂。铁道兵机械修理厂试制的油泵油咀，质量也很好。（附图片）
