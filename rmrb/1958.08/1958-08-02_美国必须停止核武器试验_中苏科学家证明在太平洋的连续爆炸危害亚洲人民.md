Xinhua News Agency, August 31st, TASS Moscow, August 30th: TASS commentator Orlov writes that the United States' unprecedentedly intense continuation of nuclear weapons testing activities has aroused the anger of world public opinion. This anger is heightened by the awareness that the U.S. military groups have chosen to conduct the tests during a period when the air currents in the Marshall Islands are more likely than at any other time to carry large amounts of radioactive material to Japan, China, Korea, and the Soviet Union. According to Soviet experts, the United States itself is protected throughout the year, especially in spring and summer, by anticyclones that prevent the direct transmission of radioactive materials from the Marshall Islands to U.S. territory, and thus is not harmed.

The Japanese newspaper "Tokyo Shimbun" wrote that today two Japanese ships had an accident, encountering radioactive radiation from a series of nuclear explosions conducted by the United States in the Pacific. Thirty-seven crew members of the two ships suffered from abnormal leucocyte counts.

This is a clear result of conducting the well-known "dirty" hydrogen bomb explosions, a fact that the American warmongers cannot quibble with. The loudly proclaimed propaganda of the so-called "clean" hydrogen bomb has been shamefully bankrupted. American news agencies indirectly acknowledged this in today's reports, which, according to well-informed sources, reported the cancellation of the so-called "clean" hydrogen bomb public test. According to authorities speaking to UPI reporters, "virtually no one was interested in this test, and its entire history presaged failure."

Based on the intensity of the American nuclear tests in recent months, one can imagine that the unverified damage caused by the American explosions far exceeds the figures cited by the Japanese newspapers. Materials obtained from Soviet observation stations five or six thousand kilometers away show that the United States conducted thirty-two explosions in the Marshall Islands in the past four months.

These materials from Soviet scientific stations have not only not been denied by the relevant U.S. authorities, but also have been deliberately avoided by the U.S. newspapers.

Judging from the aggressive policies of the United States in the Middle East and their obvious obstruction of the proposal to immediately convene a high-level meeting to resolve the existing dangerous situation, one can see that the intention of this frantic nuclear arms race is particularly malicious.

Therefore, one cannot disagree with the "unlimited anger towards nuclear testing" expressed by the "Tokyo Shimbun" on behalf of the Japanese public, which fairly regards nuclear testing as a crime against humanity.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: Atomic energy scientists here today revealed to our reporter: according to data obtained by our observation stations, it proves that since April this year, American imperialism has been continuously conducting intense nuclear weapon explosion tests in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific high seas, causing a sharp increase in the deposition of radioactive dust in the air along the southeastern coast of China.

Experts from the Atomic Energy Research Institute said that China's observation stations, using ultra-low sound methods and radioactive dust contamination sampling tests, can accurately measure the date and location of the United States' nuclear weapon tests, as well as the concentration data of radioactive dust carried by the subtropical easterly wind belt to the Chinese coast.

Experts pointed out that the United States, ignoring the opposition of people all over the world, is frantically accelerating nuclear weapon testing, and even more maliciously, deliberately chose the spring and summer seasons to conduct tests in the Pacific. During this period, seasonal winds carrying radioactive materials blow from the Pacific across the southeastern coast of China, Japan, and Korea according to the laws of atmospheric circulation, but do not blow to the United States' own territory and territorial waters. The maliciousness of their intentions can be seen.

Experts also said that from the data of radioactive dust in the air observed by our observation stations, it can be seen that the "clean" hydrogen bomb, which the United States claims does not emit radioactive dust, is actually not clean.

Experts hope that reporters will arouse the serious attention of all the people of China and the world, quickly stop this inhuman behavior of the United States, and demand that the United States immediately stop nuclear weapon testing.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st, TASS Moscow dispatch: Soviet scientist Dr. Drogaichev revealed in the Soviet scientific journal "Nature" that the United States, disregarding the protests of world opinion, is now continuing to conduct a series of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests in the Marshall Islands. The United States chose to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands in the spring and early summer because at this time of year air currents carrying radioactive materials would pass from the Marshall Islands over China, Korea, and Japan to the Soviet Union in greater quantities than at any other time of year, while the United States could avoid its intrusion.

The article pointed out that throughout the year, especially in spring and summer, the United States is not directly affected by radioactive materials from the Marshall Islands due to counter-cyclones blowing from the north, the Pacific, or Honolulu.

However, air currents and seawater carry the products of atomic fission to the Asian coast all year round. As an example, 1954 was the year with the most toxins in the rain and snow that fell in Japan, and Japanese fishermen suffered greatly. The author also pointed out that the concentration of radioactive materials in the rain and snow that fell along the Chinese coast was no lower than in Japan.

### 美国必须停止核武器试验  中苏科学家证明在太平洋的连续爆炸危害亚洲人民

    美国必须停止核武器试验
    中苏科学家证明在太平洋的连续爆炸危害亚洲人民
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日电：塔斯社评论员奥尔洛夫写道，美国空前紧张地继续试验核武器的活动引起了世界公众的愤怒。大家意识到，美国军事集团选择来进行试验的时期，正是马绍尔群岛的气流比任何时期都更能把大量的放射性物质带到日本、中国、朝鲜和苏联的季节，所以这种愤怒情绪就更加剧了。据苏联专家指出，美国本国，全年，特别是在春、夏两季，由于有反旋风来防御从马绍尔群岛吹来的放射性物质直接传布到美国领土上，所以不致受到损害。
    日本报纸“东京新闻”写道，今天有两艘日本船只发生了意外，它们遭到了美国在太平洋进行的一系列核爆炸产生的放射性辐射。这两艘船的三十七名船员得了白血球异常症。
    这是进行人所共知的“肮脏的”氢弹爆炸的明显结果，是美国好战分子无法诡辩的事实。大吹大擂地叫嚷所谓“干净”的氢弹的宣传已经可耻地破产了。美国通讯社在今天的报道中也间接地承认了这一点，这些通讯社根据消息灵通人士的透露，报道了取消所谓“干净”的氢弹公开试验的消息。据权威人士对合众国际社的记者说，“实际上没有任何人对这个试验感到兴趣，它的全部历史都预兆着失败”。
    根据近几个月来美国进行核试验的紧张程度可以想像到，美国爆炸所造成的尚未查明的损失会大大地超过日本报纸所援引的数字。因为在五、六千公里远的苏联观测站所获得的材料表明，在最近四个月中，美国在马绍尔群岛进行了三十二次爆炸。
    苏联科学站的这些材料不但有关的美国当局没有加以否认，而且美国报纸也极力避而不谈。
    根据美国在中近东的侵略政策和他们对立即召开高级会议以解决现有的危险局势的建议所进行的显而易见的刁难做法来看，人们可看出，这种疯狂的核军备竞赛的用意是特别恶毒的。
    所以，不能不同意“东京新闻”代表日本公众所表示的“对于核试验的无限的愤怒”，它公正地把核试验看成是对人类的罪行。
    新华社1日讯　此间原子能科学家今天向本社记者揭露：根据我国观测站得到的资料，证明美帝国主义从今年4月以来，在太平洋公海马绍尔群岛连续进行紧张的核武器爆炸试验，使中国东南沿海等地空气中的放射性微尘沉降剧烈增加。
    原子能研究所的专家说，中国的观测站应用超低声的方法和放射性微尘沾染取样试验，可以正确地测知美国试验核武器的日期、地点，以及由副热带东风带到中国沿海的放射性微尘浓度的数据。
    专家们指出，美国不顾全世界人民的反对，疯狂地加紧试验核武器，更恶毒的是故意选择了春夏季这个时期在太平洋试验。在这段时期内，带有放射性物质的季节风按照大气环流的规律从太平洋吹过中国东南沿海、日本和朝鲜，而不会吹到美国自己的领土和领海，其用心之恶毒可见一斑。
    专家们又说，从我们的观测站观测到的空气中放射性微尘的数据，可以看出美国所宣传的不散发放射性微尘的“干净”的氢弹实际上并不干净。
    专家希望记者唤起全中国和全世界人民的严重注意，迅速制止美国这种不讲人道的行为，要求美国立即停止核武器试验。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学家德罗加伊切夫博士在苏联科学杂志“自然”上揭露，美国不顾世界舆论的抗议，现在正继续在马绍尔群岛进行一系列原子武器和氢武器试验。美国选定春季和夏初在马绍尔群岛试验核武器，是因为在这个时候带着放射性物质的气流会比其他任何季节更多地从马绍尔群岛经过中国、朝鲜和日本吹往苏联，而美国却能避开它的侵袭。
    文章指出，美国在全年之内，尤其在春夏两季，由于从北方、太平洋或檀香山吹来的逆旋风，不会直接受到从马绍尔群岛来的放射性物质的侵袭。
    然而，气流和海水一年四季都会把原子分裂的产物带到亚洲沿海一带。以1954年为例，那一年在日本降落的雨雪中所含毒物最多，日本渔民受害很大。作者还指出，在中国沿海一带降落的雨雪中所含放射性物质浓度不低于日本。
