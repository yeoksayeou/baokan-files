　　New Tunes, New Talents
　　Li Ling
　　The folk art performances of the past week or so have revealed the tremendous development of folk art in recent years and the role it has played. These relatively simple and convenient art forms can not only sing about fragments of life but also express more complex and profound storylines and thoughts and emotions. In particular, because they are simple, widely accessible to the masses, and can quickly and closely reflect new things, they are even more worthy of our cherishing and love.
　　The majority of the programs in the past week or so reflected the new construction struggles. They expressed new themes from various angles, using various forms and styles. The more prominent musical examples include: Jingyun Dagu "Luo Shengjiao," Tianjin Shidiao "Overturning Rivers and Seas," Meihua Dagu "New Daughter-in-Law Going to the Fields," Hubei Yugu "The Story of Getting Lost," Danxian "Sunday," Xuzhou Qinshu "Physical Examination," Shanghai Kaipian "Planting Red Flags in the Mind," Changsha Dagu "He Qinglian," Hengyang Yugu "Qi Changdong," Anhui Zhui Zi "Accusing Wang," Henan Zhui Zi "Sending a Comb," Sichuan Qingyin "The Cuckoo Cries," and the newly composed folk tune "Ten Thousand Vehicles Parade," among others.
　　These relatively successful programs share a common characteristic: they are lively, vivid, and focused in their depiction. They mostly portray the spiritual character of heroic figures and the essence of advanced things through specific plots and meticulous psychological portrayals. The selected singing styles are also intimate and harmonious in conveying various different content and emotional requirements. Some singing styles, such as Tianjin Shidiao and Jingyun Dagu "Luo Shengjiao" (the musical creation in some parts of this program is also very effective), have also been innovated in terms of singing style; therefore, its musical appeal is even stronger.
　　In these performances, we have seen veteran artists such as Li Decai, Xie Dayu, Liang Xiaolou, Liu Tianyun, Jiang Yuequan, Zhu Huizhen, Wu Songquan, Liu Yuanzhi, Liu Mingzhi, Shu Sanhe, Pa Jie, and the well-known Li Yueqiu, Zhu Xueqin, Wang Yubao, Ma Zengfen... maintain a relatively high level of performance. What is particularly exciting is the emergence of a large number of new and extremely talented young actors in recent years. Hua Lianbao, Xiao Shunyu, Xiao Yingxia, Li Xiaojuan, Cui Jinlan, Jiang Aihua, Lin Dechuan, etc., each have their own characteristics and have great potential for development. Among them, Wang Yubao, Sun Shuyun, Ma Zengfen, Xiao Shunyu... and others boldly innovate in the expressive techniques of the melodies, adding a lot of new and vital blood to the original melodies, which is very valuable. Every kind of traditional melody has its excellent essence, but in order to promote the old and bring forth the new and move forward, it is necessary to continuously inject new factors so that its tones and rhythms are commensurate with the new content of life being expressed, in order to better depict the spiritual style of the new era.

　　新的曲目、新的人才
　　李凌
    七八天来的曲艺会演，显示出近几年来曲艺的发展，和它所起的作用是异常巨大的。这些比较质朴、轻便的艺术形式，不仅能歌唱片断的生活风貌，而且能表现较复杂、深刻的故事情节和思想情感。特别由于它简便，广泛接近群众，并且能够迅速地紧密地表现新的事物，就更加值得我们珍视和爱护。
    这七八天的节目，绝大部分是反映新的建设斗争的。它们从各个角度，采用各种形式和风格来表现新的题材，其中音乐方面比较突出的有：京韵大鼓“罗盛教”、天津时调“翻江倒海”、梅花大鼓“新媳妇下地”、湖北渔鼓“迷路记”、单弦“礼拜天”、徐州琴书“体格检查”、上海开篇“思想上插红旗”、长沙大鼓“贺庆莲”、衡阳渔鼓“齐昌栋”、安徽坠子“告就王”、河南坠子“送梳子”、四川清音“布谷鸟咕咕叫”和新编小调“万车游行”等。
    这些比较成功的节目，有一个共同的特点是，描写得活泼生动而又集中。它们大多是透过具体的情节和细致的心理描绘，来刻画出英雄人物的精神面貌，以及先进事物的本质。所选择的唱腔，也是亲切、协调地诉述了各种不同的内容和情感要求。有些唱腔，如天津时调、京韵大鼓“罗盛教”（这个节目有些地方的音乐创造也是很有效果）等在唱腔上还有所革新；因之它的音乐感染就更为强烈。
    在这些演出中，我们看到前一辈的艺人如、李德才、谢大玉、良小楼、刘天韵、蒋月泉、朱慧珍、武嵩泉、刘元芝、刘明枝、舒三和、爬杰和近年知名的李月秋、朱雪琴、王毓宝、马增芬……等人保持相当高的演出水平。而特别使人兴奋的是近几年涌现出大批新的极有才艺的年轻演员。花莲宝、萧顺喻、小映霞、李小娟、崔金兰、江爱华、林德川等，各有特点，且具有极大的发展前途。其中像王毓宝、孙书筠、马增芬、萧顺喻……等在曲腔的表现手法上，大胆地进行创造，使原来的唱腔，增加了许多有生命的新血液，这是非常可贵的。每种传统曲腔，都有它优秀的本质，但要推陈出新，向前发展，还需要不断注入新的因素，才能使它的音调、节奏，与所表现的新的生活内容相称，才能更好的描画出新时代的精神风貌。
