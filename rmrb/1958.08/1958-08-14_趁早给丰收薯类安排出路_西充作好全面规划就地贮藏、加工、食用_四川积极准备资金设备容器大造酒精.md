Reported by Sichuan Daily: As the sweet potato harvest season approaches, the rural areas of Sichuan are working intensely to arrange outlets for the unprecedentedly large sweet potato harvest. Following the principle of "mass mobilization, indigenous methods, and small scale," Xichong County plans to handle the county's estimated harvest of over two billion jin of sweet potatoes locally, through storage, processing for comprehensive utilization, and consumption.

Xichong County's approach to storing and preserving sweet potatoes is to prepare storage facilities in advance, harvest the sweet potatoes promptly, and use earthen cellars to store the fresh sweet potatoes. The county plans a twelve-day crash campaign to repair old cellars and dig new ones, launching a mass movement where every commune and every household digs cellars. Generally, the method is to have communes dig large cellars, households dig small cellars, and even the non-agricultural population dig sweet potato cellars, making universal preparations for storage.

In terms of processing, Xichong County's approach is: self-reliance, decentralized processing, on-site handling, and full comprehensive utilization. This year, in addition to the sweet potatoes reserved by agricultural cooperatives for seed, by farmers for food, and by the non-agricultural population according to a ration of 20% for the whole year, and the allocation of 30% of all food used by cooked food and confectionery industries, the remaining sweet potatoes that need to be processed, such as those purchased by the state, retained by the cooperatives, and some for feed, are estimated to account for 50%-60% of the total output. According to Xichong's plan, these sweet potatoes will primarily be processed into finished and semi-finished products by the agricultural cooperatives (households), while the agricultural cooperatives will also run small factories themselves for comprehensive utilization, first making starch, then using the sweet potato residue to distill liquor, and using the stillage to feed pigs. The county plans to have every commune run a distillery, every team have a flour mill, and every household slice sweet potatoes, and to implement a "four-in-one" system for flour mills, distilleries, feed yards, and pig farms, which will not only save labor but also facilitate production arrangements. They will also make full use of existing equipment, improve processing tools, achieve multiple uses for one machine, try to convert threshing machines by changing wheels, so that each commune has a foot-operated flour mill, each team has a sweet potato slicer, and organize agricultural cooperatives to make and use them themselves, borrow or rent them, and cooperate with each other.

In order to fully rely on the masses and handle the sweet potatoes well locally, Xichong County has made a comprehensive plan based on production and sales conditions, with unified arrangements and unified dispatch. Activities that can be done in advance, such as digging sweet potato cellars, rushing to make processing tools, and building kang stoves, are all contracted out in a decentralized manner with a set deadline for completion, so as not to affect the busy autumn harvest work due to the storage and processing of sweet potatoes.

After Xichong County comprehensively utilizes the sweet potatoes, which account for more than half of the county's total grain output, it is estimated that more than 140 million jin of starch can be produced, more than 38 million jin of liquor can be distilled, and more than 100,000 pigs can be fattened using stillage and sweet potato residue. This not only increases social wealth but also greatly increases farmers' income. The starch and locally produced liquor alone can generate an additional income of more than 170 yuan per household.

Furthermore, Sichuan Province plans to use sweet potatoes to brew more than 300,000 tons of alcohol this year to help farmers process their sweet potatoes. The province's industrial, grain, and commercial departments are actively preparing funds, equipment, and containers to ensure that whatever is produced in various places will be purchased. Relevant departments have also designed a set of semi-mechanized operating methods for making starch from fresh sweet potatoes. This includes washing sweet potatoes with a sweet potato washing machine, grinding fresh sweet potatoes with a powered grinder, filtering the sweet potato slurry with a round sieve slurry filter, and drying the starch using sunlight or fire stoves. Using this set of semi-mechanized operating methods, production efficiency can be greatly improved. A sweet potato washing machine requires only two operators and can wash 25 tons of fresh sweet potatoes per day; a grinder driven by a 5-kilowatt electric motor can grind 24,000 jin of fresh sweet potatoes per day, which can replace the labor of 48 people per day.

    趁早给丰收薯类安排出路
　　西充作好全面规划就地贮藏、加工、食用
　　四川积极准备资金设备容器大造酒精
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：今年红苕收获的季节已经临近，四川农村中正在紧张地准备为空前丰收的红苕安排出路。西充县按照“群、土、小”的方针，准备从收储保管、加工综合利用和食用三方面，把今年全县预计可以收获到的二十多亿斤红苕就地处理好。
    西充县收储保管红苕的作法是：提前作好储存保管准备，及时挖苕，利用土窖储存鲜苕。全县计划突击十二天，修旧苕窖、挖新苕窖，开展一个社社挖窖，户户挖窖的群众性运动。一般采取社挖大窖、户挖小窖、非农业人口也挖苕窖的办法，普遍作好储苕准备。
    在加工处理方面，西充县的办法是：自力更生，分散加工，就地处理，充分进行综合利用。今年全县所产红苕除了由农业社留种；农民留口粮；非农业人口按定量全年搭配20％；熟食糖果业用粮全部搭配30％等办法处理以外，其它如国家统购、社的提留、部分饲料等需要通过加工处理的红苕，预计约占总产量50％—60％。根据西充规划，这部分红苕主要组织指导农业社（户）加工成品和半成品，同时由农业社自办小厂，进行综合利用，先制淀粉，然后利用苕渣烤酒，以酒糟喂猪。全县计划社社办酒厂，队队有粉坊，户户切苕片，并将粉坊、酒厂、饲料场、养猪场实行“四合一”，既节省劳动力，又便于安排生产。他们还充分利用现有设备，改良加工工具，做到一机多用，尽量把打谷机换轮改装，使每个社有脚踏磨粉机，每队有红苕切片机，并组织农业社自制自用，借用租用，互相协作。
    为了充分依靠群众，就地把红苕处理好，西充县根据产销情况进行了全面规划，统一安排，统一调度。把挖苕窖、赶制加工工具、打炕灶等等能提前的活路，都采取分散包干的办法，限期突击完成，以免红苕的收储和处理，影响繁忙的秋收工作。
    西充县将占全县粮食总产量一半以上的红苕进行综合利用以后，预计可制成淀粉一亿四千多万斤，烤酒三千八百多万斤，利用酒糟苕渣喂肥猪十多万头。这不仅增加了社会财富，农民收入也大大增加，仅制淀粉和土酒两项，每户即可多收入一百七十多元。
    又讯　为了帮助农民处理红苕，四川省计划今年利用红苕酿制酒精三十万吨以上。省的工业、粮食、商业等部门正在积极从资金、设备、容器等方面作准备，保证各地生产多少就收购多少。有关部门还为鲜苕制淀粉设计了一套半机械化的操作方法。其中包括用洗苕机洗苕，用动力粉碎机磨鲜苕，用圆筛滤浆机过滤苕浆和利用日光或火灶等烘干淀粉四个环节。用这套半机械化的操作方法，生产效率可以大大提高。一台洗苕机只用二人操作，一天可洗鲜苕二十五吨；五瓩电动机带动的粉碎机，一天能磨二万四千斤鲜苕，可代替四十八个人一天的劳动。
