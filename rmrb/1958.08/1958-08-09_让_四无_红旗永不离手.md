    Keep the "Four Nos" Red Banner Forever in Hand
    Old Veteran Keeps His Spirit Young
    Recently, the weather has been hot. Every noon, the veterans in the Jiangsu Province Disabled Servicemen Sanatorium take a nap. But Wu Deju, an old veteran in his fifties, is not like that. He either takes a fly swatter to the toilets and garbage bins to catch flies, or he gets a bamboo pole wrapped with sticky cloth and coated with soapy water or spider webs to stick mosquitoes in the wards and dormitories.
    This old veteran has been doing this for two years. Even in the severe winter, he gets up at 5:30 to collect rat traps and cages from people's homes. Because he has asthma and can't climb high to catch sparrows at night, he applies tung oil to bamboo sticks to catch them during the day. When the medical staff asks him to rest more, he says, "I can't directly participate in socialist construction, but I must do my best in eliminating the four pests." In this way, in two years, he has eliminated a total of 113 catties of flies, 1,604 rats, 73 sparrows, and about 30,000 mosquitoes, winning honorary titles such as an activist in eliminating the four pests and a hygiene model.
    Red Scarf Four Pests Elimination Team
    Liu He, a small expert in eliminating the four pests from Taiping Township Central Elementary School in Zhaodong, who was rewarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Heilongjiang Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, achieved outstanding results in the summer four pests elimination campaign. This Red Scarf Four Pests Elimination Team, composed of six Young Pioneers, eliminated 2,336 rats and sparrows in ten days, averaging more than 38 rats and sparrows eliminated per day.
    The Red Scarf Four Pests Elimination Team always scouts the enemy situation in the morning, digs out and blocks sparrow nests in the evening, and goes to the fields to catch and kill wild rats during lunch breaks, ensuring that eliminating the four pests and learning are not delayed.
    Capable Auntie Zhao
    Auntie Zhao, who lives in the 15th group of Laixun Street, Binzhou Town, Bin County, Heilongjiang Province, can truly be called an expert in eliminating the four pests. Auntie Zhao is nearly sixty years old, but from the snowy winter to the scorching summer, she has always fought tirelessly against the four pests. Auntie Zhao led the children and, from last winter to July 17th this year, caught 769 sparrows, killed 579 rats, and eliminated 5,986 flies. Since the summer, Auntie Zhao has never let go of her swatter, hitting wherever she goes. Because Auntie Zhao is enthusiastic about mobilizing her neighbors to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene, she was elected as the street's sanitation committee member.
    "Maggot Extermination Expert"
    The 92 latrines in the 7th Neighborhood Committee of Ruyi Street, Shahekou District, Dalian City, have been kept free of maggots for two years.
    Xu Keda, a 71-year-old Communist Party member from the 7th Neighborhood Committee of Ruyi Street, was elected as the hygiene director in 1956. Previously, the dozens of toilets here had maggots in the stone crevices, under the footboards, and in the urinals. Old Man Xu sprinkled "666" pesticide little by little, and the next day the maggots were all dead. One day, he drilled into the latrine of the 9th Neighborhood Group to find maggots, scaring Auntie Shi, who lived in the courtyard. "Are you crazy? How can you drill in there? Isn't it smelly?" Auntie Shi said with a laugh, holding her nose. Old Man Xu said, "The smell is only temporary, the dirt is only for a while, but getting sick lasts a lifetime!"
    He also established a "one week of good weather, three full days of bad weather" pesticide spraying system. He also made improvements in the spraying method. He insisted on doing this continuously, and last year he eradicated maggots in 92 latrines. From then on, the residents called him the "Maggot Extermination Expert."

    让“四无”红旗永不离手
    老休养员心不老
    最近天气炎热，每到中午，江苏省残废军人教养院的休养员们都午睡了，五十多岁的老休养员吴德举却不是这样，他不是拿个苍蝇笼子到厕所、垃圾箱去捕苍蝇，就是弄根竹竿裹粘布粘上肥皂水或蜘蛛网到病房、宿舍去粘蚊子。
    这个老休养员两年来一直都是这样。就是在严寒的冬季他也是五点半钟就起身，到群众家里去收放鼠夹、鼠笼。因为有气喘病，晚上不能爬高捉麻雀，他就在白天用桐油涂在竹头上粘。当医务人员要他多休息的时候，他就说：“我不能直接参加社会主义建设，但在除四害中，一定要多出点力。”就这样，在两年的时间里，他共消灭了苍蝇一百一十三斤、老鼠一千六百零四只、麻雀七十三只、蚊虫约三万余只，荣获除四害积极分子、卫生模范等光荣称号。
    红领巾除四害小组
    曾受团中央和黑龙江省爱国卫生运动委员会奖励的除四害小能手——肇东太平乡中心小学校学生刘和，他领导的红领巾除四害小组，在夏季除四害运动中取得出色的成绩。这个由六名少先队员组成的红领巾除四害小组，在十天内消灭了老鼠和麻雀二千三百三十六只，平均每天消灭鼠、雀三十八只以上。
    红领巾除四害小组总是在每天早晨侦察敌情，晚上掏、堵雀窝，午休时到田间去捕打野鼠，做到了除四害与学习两不误。
    能干的赵大娘
    住在黑龙江省宾县宾州镇莱勋街十五组的赵大娘，真可称她是除四害的能手。赵大娘已年近花甲，但是她从冰雪茫茫的冬天直到赤日炎炎的仲夏，始终不懈地向四害斗争着。赵大娘带领着儿童，从去年冬天到今年7月17日，捉到了七百六十九只麻雀，捕杀五百七十九只老鼠，消灭掉五千九百八十六个苍蝇。入夏以来，赵大娘每天都手不离拍，走到哪里打到哪里。由于赵大娘热心于发动四邻除四害讲卫生，她被选上了街道的卫生委员。
    “灭蛆专家”
    旅大市沙河口区如意街第七居民委员会的九十二个便所已经保持两年没生过一个蛆。
    如意街七十一岁的共产党员徐克大1956年被选为卫生主任。以前，这里几十个厕所的石缝里、踏板底下、便池里都有蛆。徐老大爷就一点一点地撒“六六六”药，第二天蛆都死了。有一天，他钻进第九居民小组的便所里找蛆，把住在院里的史大娘吓坏了。“你傻啦？怎么好钻进去呀？不臭吗？”史大娘捂着鼻子笑着说。徐老大爷说：“臭只是一时，脏只是一会儿，得了病，可是一辈子啊！”
    他还订了“好天一星期，坏天三整天”的撒药制度。在撒药方法上他也做了改进。他就这样坚持不停地干，去年在九十二个便所里绝了蛆。从此，居民便称他为“灭蛆专家”。
