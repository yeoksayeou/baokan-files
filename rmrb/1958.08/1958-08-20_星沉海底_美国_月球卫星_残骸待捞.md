Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: Cape Canaveral (United States) Dispatch: The United States' launch of a so-called artificial satellite to the moon, after nearly five months of preparation and a long period of vigorous publicity, has been declared a failure. The rocket carrying the satellite, named "Pioneer," exploded in the air on the morning of the 17th, and another batch of American myths in the "space race" was buried with the rocket's wreckage in the rolling waves of the Atlantic Ocean, ten miles north of Cape Canaveral.

After US President Eisenhower approved the US plan to launch a lunar satellite in late March of this year, the US propaganda machine began to tout it in earnest. The publicity became even more intense more than a month before the satellite launch. They promoted that three thousand scientists and technicians, and more than fifty factories, were involved in this work.

Some newspapers said that the significance of the successful launch of this "lunar satellite" would be "comparable to Columbus' discovery of the New World"; other newspapers said that the United States would surpass the Soviet Union in launching lunar satellites. The general manager of an American company that manufactures "Vanguard" rockets also made it clear that American scientific research serves aggressive purposes. He once ecstatically said: "The country that occupies the moon rules the earth."

They were confident that this launch would be successful. According to United Press International, on the eve of the satellite launch, observatories in the United States, Britain, West Germany, and other countries were notified to point their radio telescopes at the launch direction of the American "lunar satellite" to prepare for observation. The US government made a series of arrangements, preparing to announce the launch simultaneously at Cape Canaveral and the Pentagon in Washington. Two hours after the launch, a press conference was to be held at Cape Canaveral to announce the initial results of the satellite launch. Once the satellite entered orbit, another press conference would be held to announce the "success" of the American conquest of the moon.

On the 17th, many officials from the US Department of Defense and a large number of reporters gathered at Cape Canaveral, and nearby hotels were "fully booked." Everywhere, there was talk of so-called "moon probing." As the launch time approached, reporters stood on the coast preparing to write news reports, and many observatories were indeed poised to observe and receive signals. At 12:18 international standard time, at the launch site, an official nervously counted down the last digit "0" of the command. The launch button was pressed. The rocket spewed out a cloud of white mist and ascended. But before there was time to rejoice, the rocket exploded after only a little over a minute (seventy-seven seconds). People on the coast saw it fall into the Atlantic Ocean from a distance, dragging a tail of white smoke and fire.

Afterwards, officials from the US Department of Defense did hold a press conference, but it was to announce the failure, not the success. Disheartened American experts are preparing to retrieve the wreckage of the rocket from the Atlantic Ocean for research. Because, according to US officials, the cause of the rocket explosion is still uncertain, it may have been due to a crack in the first stage rocket, or it may have been a problem with its engine.

### 星沉海底　美国“月球卫星”残骸待捞

　　星沉海底
　　美国“月球卫星”残骸待捞
    新华社19日讯  卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国经过了将近五个月的准备和长时期大肆吹嘘的所谓要向月球的人造卫星的发射，宣告失败了。带着这个命名为“先驱号”的卫星的火箭已于17日上午在空中爆炸，美国在“空间竞赛”中的又一批神话，也随着这支火箭的残骸葬身在离卡纳维拉尔角以北十英里的大西洋的滚滚浪涛之中去了。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔今年3月下旬批准美国发射月球卫星的计划后，美国宣传机构就开始煞有介事地吹嘘起来。卫星发射前一个多月吹得更加热闹。它们宣传，有三千个科学家和技术家以及五十多个工厂参与这件工作。
    有的报纸说，这个“月球卫星”发射成功的意义将“可与哥伦布发现新大陆相比”；有的报纸说，美国要在发射月球卫星上超过苏联。制造“先锋式”火箭的一家美国公司总经理也早已把美国的科学研究为侵略目的服务这一点说穿了。他曾得意忘形地说：“那个国家占领了月亮，那个国家便统治着地球”。
    他们满以为这次必然发射成功。据合众国际社报道，发射这个卫星的前夕，美国、英国和西德等国的天文台都被通知把射电望远镜正对准美国这个“月球卫星”的发射方向，准备进行观测。美国政府更作了一系列安排，它准备在卡纳维拉尔角和华盛顿五角大楼同时宣布发射的消息，发射后两个钟头准备在卡纳维拉尔角举行记者招待会宣布发射卫星的初步结果，一俟卫星进入轨道，还将举行另一次记者招待会，宣布美国征服月球的“成功”。
    17日，许多美国国防部的官员和大批记者集中到卡纳维拉尔角，附近的旅馆都告“客满”。到处谈论所谓“窥测月球”。发射时刻临近了，记者们站在海岸上准备写消息，许多天文台当真摆开架势要观测和收讯号。在国际标准时间十二点十八分，发射场上，一个官员在紧张气氛中数着发号令的最后一个数字“○”，发射钮开了。火箭喷出一团白雾上升。可是还没来得及欢喜，火箭只上升了一分多钟（七十七秒）就爆炸了。海岸上的人远远看到它夹着一条冒着白烟和火光的尾巴坠入了大西洋。
    事后，美国国防部的官员倒也举行了招待会，不过不是宣布成功，而是宣布失败。丧气的美国专家们正准备在大西洋中捞到火箭的遗骸来作研究。因为，美国官方说，火箭爆炸的原因还不能确定，可能是由于第一级火箭有裂缝，也可能是它的引擎有毛病。
