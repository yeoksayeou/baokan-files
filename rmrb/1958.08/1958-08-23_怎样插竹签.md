How to Insert Bamboo Skewers

　　The artificial auxiliary corn cultivation method created by the Shanba Cooperative Scientific Research Station in Dafang County is a successful experiment using the principle that plants can stimulate flower and fruit growth after being stimulated by the outside world. According to the preliminary experience of the Shanba Cooperative's experiment, the specific operating method is as follows:

　　1. The parts for inserting skewers: From the fourth leaf at the base of the corn stalk to the point where there are four leaves left below the tassel at the top, bamboo skewers can be inserted. The bamboo skewers should be inserted in the middle of the two nodes, and only one bamboo skewer can be inserted in each node. Insert the bamboo skewer diagonally into the corn stalk, with the tip slightly upward. When inserting, do not aim at the part where the corn cob is growing, and do not pierce the corn stalk. The depth of insertion is generally about one-half of the diameter of the corn stalk. As for how many bamboo skewers to insert into a corn plant, it should be determined according to the growth of the corn stalk. More skewers can be inserted for those that are tall and strong and have sufficient fertilizer, and four or five skewers are enough for general plants.

　　2. The time for inserting skewers should be when the corn tassel emerges three to five inches. It is not suitable to insert them too late or too early. Because if it is too late, the corn cob will not get tassel pollen and will not grow fully; if it is too early, the corn stalk is still fragile, the nodes are not yet distinct, and inserting in the wrong place will affect growth.

　　3. The bamboo skewers inserted into the corn stalks are about the length of ordinary matches, but thicker than matchsticks. One end is sharpened, and it should be pulled out after insertion. After experimental verification, the corn variety has no effect on the effect of inserting bamboo skewers.

　　Since the artificial auxiliary corn cultivation method is an important measure for increasing production, fertilization, artificial pollination, and weeding should be immediately followed up after inserting the bamboo skewers. If there is a lack of nutrients, it will form "too many children for a poor mother," and the corn cobs will inevitably grow small. Secondly, with many corn cobs, the tassel pollen at the top may not necessarily fall on the cobs that grow at the base, so timely artificial pollination is necessary to ensure that the corn kernels are full.

　　怎样插竹签
    大方县山坝社科学研究站创造的人工辅助玉米生育法，是运用植物受外界刺激后能促使花果生长的原理试验成功的。根据山坝社试验的初步经验，具体操作方法如下：
    一、插签的部位：从玉米秆根部第四片叶子开始，到上端离天花还有四片叶子的地方止，都可以插竹签。竹签要插在两个节的正中间，每节只能插一根竹签。竹签斜插进玉米秆，尖端稍向上。插时不能对着生育玉米包的部位，也不能把玉米秆插穿，插进的深度一般约为玉米秆直径的二分之一，至于一株玉米插多少竹签，应根据玉米秆成长情况而定，长得高大粗壮、肥料足的可多插，一般的插四、五根就行了。
    二、插签的时间，应在玉米出天花三至五寸的时候，过迟过早都不适宜。因为过迟，玉米包得不到天花粉，长得不饱满，过早，玉米秆还脆弱，节节还不分明，错插部位反而影响生长。
    三、插玉米秆的竹签，像一般火柴那样长，但比火柴秆要粗些，一头削尖，插后要拔出。玉米品种对插竹签的效果，经试验证明，没有关系。
    由于人工辅助玉米生育法是增产的一个重要措施，因此在插竹签后，追肥、人工授粉和耘锄等工作要立即跟上。如果缺乏养分，就会形成“儿多母苦”，玉米包必然长得细小。其次，玉米包一多，顶端的天花粉不一定能落在根部结的包包上，及时进行人工授粉，才能保证棒子结米饱满。
