　　Technician Li Guangren's Vacation
    A sweaty old man suddenly ran in from the doorway. While wiping his sweat, he said breathlessly, "I'm here to register." He then handed me a card. I quickly put down my cigarette, took it, and couldn't help but laugh: The card clearly stated, "Li Guangren, Technician of Lihua Rubber Factory, on vacation for two months according to labor insurance regulations." I thought, maybe he came to the wrong place. So I handed the card back to the old man and said, "Comrade, you've come to the wrong place." Unexpectedly, the old man shouted loudly, "What? Isn't this the expansion site of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company? I'm here to participate in the expansion work!" I said, "Aren't you a technician from the Rubber Factory?" Before I could finish, he interrupted, "Yes, I am a technician from Lihua Rubber Factory. Because I'm old, the factory is afraid I can't stand the heat, so they insisted I take a two-month vacation. They wouldn't let me work no matter what. I heard people say there's an expansion going on here, so I came." However, he became very unhappy when he heard that everyone participating in the work must have a certificate for the safety of the construction site, saying, "Comrade, you know the factory wants me to take a vacation, how would they give me a certificate? Aren't you deliberately making things difficult for me?" In the end, he shouted to see the leading comrade, so I had no choice but to lead him to the construction site director.
    After the construction site director understood the matter, he just explained to him, "Comrade Li Guangren, you are old, so take the vacation the factory gives you. Take care of your health, so you can concentrate on your work later. Of course, your spirit is commendable." I thought, surely he would give up this idea now? Unexpectedly, he still shouted:
  "Comrade Director, are you afraid that I'm old and useless?" As he spoke, he grabbed Director Wang's mud carrying pole, carried it for two hundred meters, and then turned back, his face not even changing color. He continued, "How about it? Am I okay?" The construction site director was so pleased when he saw this that he couldn't speak for a moment. Upon seeing this, Technician Li Guangren quickly took out his trade union membership card and handed it to Director Wang, saying, "Director, my credentials, are you relieved this time?" Director Wang looked at it, considered it for a long time, and finally said, "Alright, I'll approve it." When he heard this, he was so happy that he jumped and danced, flailing his arms and legs as he ran into the bustling crowd.
    Director Wang looked at his youthful back and turned to me, saying, "Register him. There's no problem with someone like that."

　　李广仁技师的休假
    从门口忽然跑进一个汗流浃背的老头来。他一面擦着汗，一面上气不接下气地说：“我是来登记的。”又一面递给我一张卡片。我忙把烟放下，接过来一看，不禁笑起来：那卡片上明明注着“利华橡胶厂李广仁技师，按劳保条例，休假两月。”我想，莫不是他弄错地方了。就递给那老头说：“同志，找错地方了。”哪知那老头却大声嚷道：“怎么，这不是重庆钢铁公司扩建工地吗？我是来参加扩建工作的呀！”我说：“您不是橡胶厂的技师吗？”没等我说完，他就抢着说：“是啊，我是利华橡胶厂技师。因为年纪老了，厂里怕我这大热天吃不消，就硬叫我休两个月假。说啥也不让我工作。我听人家说这里搞扩建，就跑来了。”然而，他听到为了工地安全，参加工作的人都必须要有证明。可老大不高兴起来，说：“同志，你明知工厂要我休假，哪会给我证明呢？你不是有意为难我罢了。”最后，他嚷着要见领导同志，我便只好领他到工地主任那里去了。
    工地主任弄明这件事以后，也只是给他解释道：“李广仁同志，你年纪大了，厂里让你休假，就休假吧。养好身体，以后好集中精力去干工作。当然，你这种精神是很可贵的。”我想，这回他总要死了这条心吧？哪知他仍然嚷着：
  “主任同志，你怕我年老无用吧？”说着，抓起王主任的泥担子，挑着走了二百来公尺，又折了回来，真是面不改色。又继续说道：“怎么样？行吗？”工地主任看了，一时欢喜得说不上话来了。李广仁技师见了，又连忙掏出自己的工会会员证来，递给王主任说：“主任，证件，这次放心了吧。”王主任看了，又考虑了好久，终于说道：“好吧，就批准了你吧。”他一听，这可高兴了，连蹦带跳，手舞足蹈的就跑进了来往不息的人群里去。
    王主任看着他那青年般的背影，回头对我说：给他登上记吧，像这样的人，保管没问题。”
