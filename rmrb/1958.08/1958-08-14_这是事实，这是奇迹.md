　　This is Fact, This is a Miracle
　　Associate Research Fellow of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zheng Jiannan
　　I was honored to participate in the high-yield acceptance work for early rice in Xiaogan, and I witnessed the high-yield miracle of 15,361 jin per mu of early rice in the Changfeng Cooperative.
　　On July 30th, the 1.21 mu high-yield field cultivated by Cooperative Director Guan Musheng and the youth shock brigade members was harvested. I, along with more than 120 acceptance representatives, learned about the soil properties of this field, checked the plant density, number of panicles, and grain weight of this field, and verified the rice yield of this field, confirming that all of this was fact, was a miracle.
　　First, from the perspective of the soil properties of this field: this field is "dead horse dry soil," and the soil properties are "a knife when it's sunny, a mess when it rains." In the past, the annual yield was often only a hundred jin or so, but now they have turned dead soil into fertile fields, and turned low yield into high yield, with the yield increasing a hundredfold. This is fact, this is a miracle.
　　Second, from the perspective of plant density, number of panicles, and grain weight: the plant spacing of this field is 1.4 inches, the row spacing is 1.65 inches, more than 259,400 seedlings were planted per mu, with an average of 11.35 panicles per seedling, with some having as many as 21 panicles and some having as few as 7 to 8 panicles. There are 2,940,800 panicles per mu, with an average of 88.6 grains of filled rice per panicle, and 17,000 grains per jin. If calculated based on an area of one square Chinese foot, there would be 500 panicles, which could yield more than 2.5 jin of dry rice (specimens of plant and density are retained). They have created an unprecedented model of high-density planting for increased production, this is fact, this is a miracle.
　　Third, from the perspective of the technical measures taken to achieve high yield: their experience is "uprooting seedlings for full stands, early, dense, fertilizer, deep." They mainly mastered the two key links of uprooting seedlings for dense planting and foliar fertilization, increasing density, ensuring the number of panicles and grains, and increasing grain weight to obtain high yields. In specific practices: (1) Uprooting seedlings for dense planting: they creatively promoted the traditional experience of uprooting seedlings, adopting sparse planting for uprooting seedlings (uprooting seedling density is about 70,000 seedlings per mu, half as sparse as general uprooting seedlings), extending the age of the uprooted seedlings (45 days, about twice as long as general uprooting seedling time). This maintains ventilation and light transmission in the uprooting seedling field, provides sufficient fertilizer, increases the effective tillers per seedling, completes the vegetative growth of the seedlings, and enters the panicle formation stage, ensuring the number of panicles and grains per seedling. When budding on June 17, the uprooted seedlings of the same variety and age were transplanted into another uprooting seedling field, adopting the method of adding rows between rows, adding seedlings between plants, supplementing small seedlings with large ones, and filling up missing seedlings, to increase the number of seedlings per mu. (2) Foliar fertilization: after the uprooted seedlings were moved into the field, they also successfully applied the advanced technology of continuous foliar fertilization. During the period from June 20 to July 5, they continuously applied foliar fertilizer twelve times, each time using one jin of superphosphate, five jin of plant ash, and one bucket of human urine (about 45 jin) mixed with 100 jin of water to meet the nutritional needs under high-density planting, thereby increasing grain weight, making the 1000-grain weight increase to 29.4 grams, about 15% more than the grain weight of general fields of the same variety. Their creative use of traditional experience and advanced technology, as well as the bold initiative of transplanting seedlings when they are budding, this is fact, this is a miracle.
　　Although this field achieved a high yield of more than 15,000 jin, from the actual situation, I believe there is still great potential to be tapped here. For example:
　　(1) Take measures in the uprooting seedling field to inhibit ineffective tillering, cultivate small panicles with few grains into large panicles, or replace them with early japonica No. 16 or other varieties with a higher number of grains and grain weight. With the same density, the yield will increase. (2) On the basis of the existing density, further increase the number of seedlings, and the yield can be greatly increased.
　　What does this miracle tell us?
　　This miracle tells us that as long as politics takes command and people's thinking leaps forward, production will inevitably leap forward. Under the shining of the General Line and under the specific leadership of Party committees at all levels, the youth shock brigade members of the Changfeng Cooperative have greatly liberated their thinking and demonstrated soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, thus creating this high-yield miracle.
　　This miracle also tells us the truth that "things are done by people, and people will conquer nature." The Changfeng Cooperative created this high-yield miracle. They have no good conditions, no special tools, and no "expert" guidance. What they have is the spirit of drilling and hard work, confidence and determination, and that's how they created the miracle. This is a powerful refutation and counterattack against the fallacies and sophistries of the "observers," "skeptics," "conditionalists," "production has reached its peak theorists," and the reactionary bourgeois "law of diminishing returns of land," etc.
　　This miracle also tells us that the uprooting seedling dense planting experience of the Changfeng Cooperative has major production and scientific significance. Their creative promotion of uprooting seedling experience and the use of advanced technology, as well as the bolder pioneering successful example of transplanting seedlings when they are budding, opens up a new way for high-density planting to ensure the highest number of panicles per mu. At the same time, the uprooting seedling fields left behind can also be replanted with a crop of late rice, so that the potential of the land can be fully tapped to produce more grain.
　　This miracle also tells me and all our agricultural scientific research workers that new agricultural science is constantly emerging in the countryside, in the high-yield fields of the peasant masses. The miracles that appear today are no longer 3,000 jin or 5,000 jin, but 10,000 jin, 20,000 jin, or even higher. I deeply feel that this situation is pressing and does not allow us to slow down or hesitate. Instead, it requires us to break superstitions, liberate our minds, go all out, and strive for the top; it requires us to step out of the research institute, go to the countryside, delve into production practice, humbly learn from the peasant masses, and train ourselves to become a proletarian intellectual who is both red and expert, truly achieving agricultural science serving production. This is the greatest enlightenment and education I have gained in this acceptance.

　　这是事实，这是奇迹
　　中国农业科学院副研究员　郑建楠
    我很荣幸地参加孝感早稻丰产验收工作，我亲眼看到长风社早稻亩产一万五千三百六十一斤的高产奇迹。
    7月30日这一天，社主任官木生和青年突击队员们种植的一亩二分一厘高产田收割了。我和一百二十多位验收代表一道了解了这块田的土壤性质，检查了这块田的植株密度，穗数和粒重，验收了这块田的稻谷产量，证实了这一切都是事实，都是奇迹。
    首先，从这块田的土壤性质来看：这块田是“死马干土”，这种土壤性质是“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”。过去常年产量百把斤，而今他们变死土为良田，变低产为高产，产量翻百番。这是事实，这是奇迹。
    其次，从植株密度、穗数和粒重来看：这块田的株距一点四寸，行距一点六五寸，亩插二十五万九千四百多蔸，每蔸平均十一点三五穗，多的二十一穗，少的七至八穗，每亩有二百九十四万零八百穗，每穗平均有实谷八十八点六粒，每斤粒数一万七千粒，如按一平方市尺面积计算，就有五百穗，可收干谷二点五斤多（植株、密度都留有标本）。他们创造出史无前例的高度密植增产典型，这是事实，这是奇迹。
    第三，从获得高产的技术措施来看：他们的经验是“掇秧全苗，早、密、肥、深”，他们主要掌握掇秧密植，根外追肥这两个主要环节，增加密度，保证穗数、粒数，提高粒重，获得高额丰产。在具体做法上：（1）掇秧密植，他们创造性地发扬了传统的掇秧经验，采取稀植掇秧（掇秧密度每亩约七万多蔸，比一般掇秧稀一半），延长掇秧秧龄（计四十五天，比一般掇秧时间约长一倍），这样在掇秧田内保持通风透光，供给足够的肥份，增加每蔸的有效分蘖，完成秧苗的营养生长并进入到穗形成阶段，保证了每蔸穗数和粒数。到6月17日打苞时，把同品种、同秧龄的掇秧补植在另一掇秧田内，采取行间加行，株间加株，小蔸补大，缺蔸补齐的办法，增加每亩蔸数。（2）根外追肥，在掇秧移入本田后，他们也成功的应用连续根外追肥的先进技术，从6月20日至7月5日的期间内，连续根外追肥十二次，每次用过磷酸钙一斤，草木灰五斤，人尿一桶（约四十五斤）加水一百斤，满足在高度密植情况下营养需要，从而提高粒重，使千粒重提高到二十九点四克，比同品种的一般田粒重增加15％左右。他们这样创造性地运用传统经验和先进技术，以及大胆首创在秧苗打苞时的移栽办法，这是事实，这是奇迹。
    这块田虽然获得一万五千多斤的高产，但从实际情况来看，我认为这里还有很大潜力可挖。如
  （1）在掇秧田采取措施，抑制无效分蘖，把粒数少的小穗培育成大穗，或改用早粳16号或其他粒数、粒重较高的品种，用同样的密度，产量还会提高。（2）在现有密度基础上，再增加蔸数，产量更可大大提高。
    这个奇迹告诉我们什么呢？
    这个奇迹告诉我们：只要政治挂帅，人们思想大跃进，就必然带来了生产大跃进。长风社的青年突击队员们，在总路线光辉照耀下，在各级党委具体领导下，突击队员们思想大解放，拿出冲天的革命干劲，因而创造出这个高产奇迹。
    这个奇迹还告诉我们：“事在人为，人定胜天”这一条真理。长风社创造这个高产奇迹，他们没有什么好条件，也没有什么特殊工具，更没有什么“专家”指导，他们有的是钻劲和干劲，信心和决心，就这样创造出奇迹。这对“观潮派”、“怀疑派”、“条件论”者、“生产到顶论”者以及反动的资产阶级的“土地报酬渐减论”等等的谎言谬论，是一个有力的驳斥和回击。
    这个奇迹又告诉我们，长风社的掇秧密植经验有着重大的生产和科学意义。他们创造性地发扬掇秧经验和运用先进技术，更大胆地首创秧苗在打苞时移栽的成功事例，这为高度密植保证每亩获得最高穗数开辟了新的途径，同时遗留下来的掇秧田还可补插一季晚稻，这样可以充分挖掘土地潜力，增产更多的粮食。
    这个奇迹又告诉我以及我们所有的农业科学研究工作者，新的农业科学已经在农村中、在农民群众的丰产田中不断涌现，今天出现的奇迹已经不是三千斤、五千斤，而是一万斤、两万斤甚至更高。我深深感到这个形势逼人，不容许我们再缓步挡车或彷徨不前，而要我们破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游；要我们走出研究所，走向农村，深入生产实践，虚心地向农民群众学习，把自己锻炼成为一个又红又专、红透专深的无产阶级的知识分子，真正做到农业科学为生产服务，这是我在这次验收中获得的最大启示和教育。
