Communes Establish Joint Factories; Townships Organize Industrial Management Committees.
Two Threads Lift Thousands of Township and Commune Factories.
Wei County's Local Industries Strengthen Production Management and Improve Production Efficiency.
(Our newspaper, Handan, 4th dispatch by reporter Fang Chen) After the widespread development of county, township, and commune-run industries, how can we quickly establish a normal production order, develop production, and meet the needs of agricultural development? Wei County, Hebei Province, has initially explored some experiences.

The county's industrial base was originally very weak, and the vast majority of county, township, and commune-run factories were newly built and lacked production management experience. From April to July of this year, 3,154 small factories in the county have been put into production. One township alone has 100 to 200 small factories, but only two or three cadres are in charge of industry, and only one industrial deputy director of the agricultural cooperative leads industrial production. Due to the large number of factories and the small number of cadres leading industry, and the lack of experience in leading production, a large proportion of factories are often in a state of being unattended.

In order to strengthen the leadership of industrial production, the county party committee decided that the various small factories run by agricultural cooperatives should adopt the method of decentralized production and unified planning management, and establish "Wan Bao Quan" style joint factories with the agricultural cooperative as the unit. The agricultural cooperative's deputy director in charge of industry serves as the director of the joint factory, with two deputy directors (none of whom are removed from production) in charge of finance and production respectively. The original small factories are turned into production teams of the joint factory, with unified planning and centralized management. The results of the pilot project prove that the joint factory form of commune-run industries is more adaptable to the seasonality of agricultural production, can flexibly and uniformly adjust labor, and comprehensively utilize production tools and power equipment; there are fewer leadership levels, and problems are solved quickly. For example, the Chang Dawangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative built eight small factories, each of which was an independent accounting unit, so they all wanted their own factory to be convenient, and often had disagreements over investment, equipment allocation, and other issues. After the establishment of the joint factory, the labor force and production tools are uniformly allocated according to the size of the tasks of various products, which not only saves investment, but also doubles production efficiency.

At the township level, an industrial management committee is formed by representatives from the Party, government, the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, supply and marketing cooperatives, and old workers from the farm implement repair factory (one or two people). In addition to being responsible for leading industrial production at the township level, it also regularly studies the industrial production situation in the township and helps commune-run factories solve difficulties in production technology and raw material supply.

At present, the production plans of the county and township-run factories in Wei County are mostly based on the requirements of agricultural production, formulating annual, quarterly, and monthly production plans and new product trial production plans, and signing production contracts with agricultural cooperatives or commercial departments that need the products. In this way, not only is the integration of county, township, and commune-run industry and agriculture achieved through unified planning and overall arrangements, avoiding blindness in industrial production, but also the majority of workers, after discussing the plans, can understand the role of their hard work in increasing agricultural production. Many workers are actively thinking of ways to improve production tools and increase production efficiency.

    社社成立联合厂，乡乡组织工业管理委员会
    两根线提起千百个乡社工厂
    魏县地方工业健全生产管理提高生产效率
    本报邯郸4日电　记者方辰报道：县、乡、社营工业普遍发展起来以后，如何迅速地建立起正常生产秩序，发展生产，满足农业发展需要？河北省魏县初步摸索到了一些经验。
    这个县的工业基础原来很薄弱，绝大多数县、乡、社营工厂都是新建的，缺乏生产管理经验。今年4月到7月，全县已有三千一百五十四座小型工厂投入生产。一个乡里就有一、二百座小工厂，但是只有两三名干部专管工业，农业社领导工业生产的只有一名工业副社长。由于工厂多，领导工业的干部少，又缺乏领导生产经验，很大一部分工厂经常处于无人负责状态。
    为了加强工业生产领导，县委决定农业社办的各个小工厂，采取分散生产，统一计划管理办法，以社为单位成立“万宝全”式的联合厂。农业社工业副社长为联合厂厂长，下设两名副厂长（都不脱产），分管财务和生产，把原来的小工厂变成联合厂的生产小组，统一计划，集中管理。试行的结果证明，社营工业采取联合厂形式，更易于适应农业生产的季节性，可以灵活地统一调剂劳力，综合利用生产工具和动力设备；领导层次少，解决问题快。如常大王庄农业社，建起来了八座小工厂，各厂又是独立的核算单位，因而都想自己工厂方便，经常为投资、工具配备等问题闹意见，成立联合厂以后，根据各种产品的任务大小，由联合厂统一调配劳力和生产工具，不仅节省了投资，生产效率也提高一倍。
    乡一级由党、政、团和妇联会、供销社、农具修制厂老工人参加（一至二人）组成工业管理委员会，除负责领导乡一级工业生产外，并且定期研究全乡工业生产情况，帮助社营工厂解决生产技术和原材料供应等方面困难。
    现在，魏县的县、乡营工厂的生产计划，大都是根据农业生产要求，制订全年、季度、月份生产计划和新产品试制计划，并与需要产品的农业社或商业部门签订生产合同。这样不仅使县、乡、社工农业生产作到了统一规划，统筹安排，避免了工业生产中的盲目性，同时，大多数工人经过讨论计划，都能了解自己的辛勤劳动，在农业增产中的作用。许多工人积极想办法改进生产工具，提高生产效率。
