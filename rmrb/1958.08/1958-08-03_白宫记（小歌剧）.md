White House Chronicle (Operetta)
Fushi

(Scene: Offstage singing)
	Luxurious White House,
	A scene of haze,
	Candles are lit,
	Funeral bells chime.

(Dulles enters crookedly, towards President Eisenhower, who is pacing back and forth)
Dulles (singing):
	There's no oil on the office floor,
	Why does the President pace and lower his head all day long?
	There's no Communist up on the ceiling,
	Why does the President keep rolling his eyes upward?
	No crowds of demonstrators are pressing him in the office,
	Why does sweat drip from the President's head?
	The office phone hasn't stopped ringing for a minute,
	Why does the President always scold the Defense Department for not reporting good military news?
	The "correct" map for sending troops is laid out in the office,
	Why does the President keep changing it and scribbling over it?!
	(Suddenly shouts: Heavens! … a great sound of smashing ensues)
Dulles (singing):
	Everything in the office is beautifully arranged,
	Why does the President wish he could smash it all to pieces?!
	(Silence for a while, about as long as Dulles would take one hundred and sixty breaths)
Eisenhower (singing):
	Everywhere is a clamor,
	Everything is a dark shadow,
	I haven't slept for a week,
	My head is dizzy, my eyes are blurry, my ears are ringing.
	Hoping for a victory to start,
	Who knew I'd hit a snag as soon as I went out?
	The Middle East resists with all its people,
	Countries around the world respond.
	Barbarism and brutality are ineffective,
	Atomic threats don't work,
	The power of the people is frightening,
	Afraid to think about the Soviet Union launching satellites.
	To retreat means to lose face completely,
	To fight is really hard to win,
	Oh, the "grave consequences,"
	Are about to… have already arrived!
	(Eisenhower and Dulles both collapse with a cry of "Ah!")

    白宫记（小歌剧）
    俯拾
    幕内唱景：
    豪华白宫，
    一片朦胧，
    点起蜡烛，
    敲起丧钟。
    杜勒斯（一溜歪斜上，对走来走去的艾克总统）唱：
    办公室的地板没有石油，
    干吗总统日夜踱步低着头？
    办公室的天花板没有共产，
    干吗总统的眼睛老朝上翻？
    办公室没有示威人群来逼，
    干吗总统头上冒汗往下滴？
    办公室的电话一分钟都没停，
    干吗总统老骂国防部不报告好军情？
    办公室摆着出兵“正确”的地图，
    干吗总统还改了又改，涂了又涂？！
    （突然喊起：天呀！……一阵捣毁的声音大作）
    杜勒斯唱：
    办公室摆设的一切都很优美，
    干吗总统恨不得一下全打碎！？
    （沉默一回，大约有杜勒斯喘气一百六十次那么长的时间）
    艾克唱：
    到处全是闹声，
    一切都是黑影，
    可怜我一周没睡，
    头昏眼花耳鸣。
    指望旗开得胜，
    谁知出马碰钉，
    中东全民抵抗，
    世界各国响应。
    野蛮残暴无效，
    原子恐吓不灵，
    可惊的人民力量，
    怕想苏联射卫星。
    要退脸皮丢尽，
    要打实难打赢，
    哎呀“严重后果”，
    马上……已经来临！
    （艾、杜二人啊的一声倒下。）
