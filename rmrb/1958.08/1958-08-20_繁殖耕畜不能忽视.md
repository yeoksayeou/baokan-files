　　Neglecting the Breeding of Draft Animals is Unacceptable
    Under the encouragement of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a breeding movement for draft animals has been launched throughout the country this year and has achieved remarkable results. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-five provinces (regions) and cities, 11.87 million female animals have been mated, accounting for 57% of the total number of adult female animals, which greatly exceeds the number of matings in the same period in previous years.
    However, judging from the situation between regions, the progress of draft animal mating is very uneven. At present, there are still some provinces (regions) and cities where the number of mated female animals has not exceeded 40% of the number of adult female animals. Within a province, there are similar situations. Some areas have achieved full mating and full pregnancy, while in others the mating rate of female animals is only 20%. In order to achieve greater success in this year's draft animal breeding work, it is necessary to exert full effort, universally conduct pregnancy checks and supplementary matings, and implement the draft animal breeding work throughout the year.
    At present, the mating season for horses and donkeys has not completely passed, and the mating season for cattle is still very long; especially in areas with warmer climates, cows are in heat year-round, and farmers have always had the habit of autumn mating, making supplementary mating even more favorable. Areas with faster mating progress should seize this opportunity to do a good job in supplementary mating, ensuring pregnancy, ensuring production, and ensuring survival, and strive to achieve complete success in all four aspects. Areas with slower mating progress should vigorously carry out livestock breeding work during this period, striving to catch up with and surpass advanced areas. Gansu Province has proposed: "Female animals in heat must be mated, and if they are not pregnant, they will be mated again, ensuring mating to the end." Hubei Province has proposed achieving full pregnancy of female animals throughout the province by the end of September. Sichuan Province has mated more than 786,000 animals in the first half of the year and plans to mate another 620,000 in the second half. Jiangsu Province has mated more than 200,000 animals in the first half of the year and plans to mate another 700,000 in the second half. This spirit of increasing effort is worthy of universal learning.
    The draft animal breeding work, like other work, depends on the leadership's attention for its success. For example, Penglai and Qixia counties in Shandong Province did not have the habit of breeding draft animals in the past, but due to strengthened leadership and dedicated personnel in charge, and the implementation of a tiered contract system, the number of mated female animals had reached more than 70% of the number of adult female animals by the end of July; while in Weixian and Yishui counties, although there was a habit of breeding draft animals in the past, the number of matings was less than 20% due to the lack of attention from the leadership. From this, it can be seen that strengthening leadership is the key to doing this work well.

### 繁殖耕畜不能忽视

　　繁殖耕畜不能忽视
    在工农业生产大跃进高潮的鼓舞下，今年全国各地普遍掀起了繁殖耕畜运动，并取得了显著成绩。据二十五个省（区）市的不完全统计，目前已配母畜一千一百八十七万头，占成年母畜总数57％，大大超过了往年同期的配种数。
    但是，从地区间的情况来看，耕畜配种进度是很不平衡的，目前还有一些省（区）、市配种的母畜数，还没有超过成年母畜数的40％。就一省范围看，也有类似情况，进度快的是已全配、全准，进度慢的是母畜配种率仅有20％。为了使今年的耕畜配种工作获得更大的成绩，必须鼓足干劲，普遍进行查胎补配，把耕畜的配种工作，贯彻到全年。
    现在，马、驴的配种时期还未完全过去，牛的配种季节也还很长；尤其是在气候较暖的地区，母牛常年发情，农民一向有秋配习惯，补配的条件更好。配种进度较快的地区要抓紧这个机会做好补配，保胎，保产，保活工作，力争实现四全。配种进度较慢的地区，更要在这个时期里大力开展牲畜配种工作，力争赶上先进地区和超过先进地区。甘肃省提出的：“对发情母畜必配，不怀再配，包配到底”。湖北省提出在9月底实现全省母畜满怀。四川省上半年已配七十八万六千多头，下半年还要配六十二万头。江苏省上半年已配二十多万头，下半年计划再配七十万头。这种越干劲头越大的精神是值得普遍学习的。
    耕畜配种工作也和别的工作一样，开展的好不好，关键在于领导抓的紧不紧。如山东省蓬莱，栖霞等县过去没有繁殖耕畜的习惯，但由于领导加强和有专人负责，实行层层包干，到7月下旬，配种母畜数已达成年母畜数的70％以上；而潍县，沂水等县，过去虽有繁殖耕畜习惯，但因领导部门抓的不紧，配种数还不到20％。由此可见，加强领导是作好这一工作的关键。
