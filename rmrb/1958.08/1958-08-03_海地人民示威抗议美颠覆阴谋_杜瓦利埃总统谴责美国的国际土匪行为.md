Haitian People Demonstrate Against American Subversion Plot
President Duvalier Condemns America's International Banditry
While Dulles is making a big fuss about so-called "indirect aggression," American soldiers are blatantly suppressing the people of small countries.
——TASS commentator slams US armed intervention in Cuba

Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, Port-au-Prince dispatch: Haitian President Duvalier, at a press conference at the Presidential Palace on August 1st, accused the United States of allowing Haitian fugitives to plot against the Haitian government within US territory. He said: The recent coup plot is an act of international banditry.

On July 31st, about five hundred Haitians demonstrated in front of the US Embassy in Haiti to protest against the participation of some Americans, including the former US military attache in Haiti, in a military rebellion aimed at overthrowing the Haitian government. This rebellion had already been suppressed by the Haitian authorities on July 29th.

Former Haitian officials who supported this conspiracy are still in the United States. Demonstrators are demanding the extradition of these Haitian officials from the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, TASS New York dispatch: The Spanish-language "Hoy" newspaper published in New York on August 1st published an editorial condemning American interference in Cuba. The editorial said: "The United States sent Marines to Oriente Province to protect the water supply system of the US garrison at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba. This action has created new contradictions in the relationship between Washington and other American republics. The actions of the US Navy have naturally angered the Cuban people and undoubtedly angered the people of Latin America."

The newspaper pointed out that the American "aggressors are colluding with the Batista dictator's government" and demanded an immediate end to this intervention in Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, TASS Moscow dispatch: TASS commentator Orlov commented on the US military's armed intervention in Cuba: Just as Mr. Dulles is making a big fuss about the "indirect aggression" in the Near East that he himself invented, trying to prove that the people's liberation movement in the region is not due to long-term colonial rule, but due to foreign radio broadcasts, fully armed American soldiers are blatantly carrying out direct aggression, suppressing the people of small countries, and attempting to impose their own "order" there (Cuba).

Orlov said: According to any norm of international law, the US Navy's intervention in Cuba's internal affairs is a violation of sovereignty.

The US State Department hopes that the armed intervention in Cuba can be carried out under the guise of "defending American interests" without being discovered. This plan has failed. Cuban rebel leader Castro has warned the United States that American aggression could lead to a serious conflict between the Cuban rebels and the US military.

Orlov pointed out that the US State Department is busy clamoring about the so-called "indirect aggression" in the Arab East to create a smokescreen. He wrote: But can this smokescreen really hide the bayonets and cannons of the United States in Lebanon or Cuba? (Attached picture)

On July 29, the United States conspired to launch a military coup in Haiti in an attempt to overthrow the current government. After several hours of fighting, the rebellion was quelled.

    海地人民示威抗议美颠覆阴谋
    杜瓦利埃总统谴责美国的国际土匪行为
    当杜勒斯正围绕所谓“间接侵略”大做文章的时候，美国士兵却明目张胆镇压小国人民。
    ——塔斯社评论员斥美国在古巴的武装干涉行动
    新华社2日讯　太子港消息：海地总统杜瓦利埃1日在总统府的记者招待会上指责美国准许海地的逃亡分子在美国境内策划反对海地政府的阴谋。他说：最近的政变阴谋是一种国际土匪行为。
    7月31日，约有五百名海地人在美国驻海地大使馆前举行示威，抗议包括前美国驻海地武官在内的一些美国人参加目的在推翻海地政府的军事暴乱。这次暴乱已经在7月29日被海地当局镇压下去。
    支持这次阴谋罪行的前海地官员现在还在美国。示威者要求从美国引渡这些海地官员。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：纽约出版的西班牙文“今日新闻报”1日发表社论，谴责美国干涉古巴。社论说：“美国派海军陆战队到奥连特省保护美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地驻军的供水系统。这种行动给华盛顿和其他美洲共和国的关系创造了新的矛盾。美国海军的行动，很自然地激怒了古巴人，无疑也激怒了拉丁美洲的人民。”
    报纸指出美国“侵略者同巴蒂斯塔独裁者的政府有勾搭”，并且要求立即结束这种干涉古巴的行动。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社评论员奥尔洛夫评论美国军队在古巴的武装干涉行动说：正当杜勒斯先生围绕他自己所发明的中近东遭到“间接侵略”的问题大做文章，力图证明这个地区的人民解放运动不是由于长期以来的殖民统治，而是由于外国的无线电广播所造成的时候，全副武装的美国士兵却在明目张胆地进行直接侵略，镇压小国人民，企图在那里（古巴）推行自己的“秩序”。
    奥尔洛夫说：根据国际法的任何准则，美国海军干涉古巴的内政这件事都是对主权的破坏。
    美国国务院指望对古巴的武装干涉能在“保卫美国利益”的幌子下进行而不致被人发现。这种打算落空了。古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗已经警告美国说，美国的侵略可能导致古巴起义军和美军之间的严重冲突。
    奥尔洛夫指出，美国国务院正在忙于叫嚷所谓在阿拉伯东方的“间接侵略”以制造烟幕。他写道：但是这种烟幕难道能够掩盖得住美国在黎巴嫩或者在古巴的刺刀和炮口吗？（附图片）
