　　Three Methods for Preserving Bamboo and Preventing Insect Infestation
    In the past, I conducted three experiments on bamboo preservation and insect prevention. Now, I am presenting three methods that yielded relatively good results in the experiments for everyone's reference.
    In May 1953, old greenish moso bamboo was used as foundation joists. First, the bamboo was split open and shaped into half-square, rebar-like bamboo strips. Then, 25 kilograms of fine sand and 1.3 kilograms of calcium chloride were placed in a double-layered heated tin box and heated simultaneously with the bamboo strips. After about two hours, the bamboo strips were taken out and immediately placed in a melted, double-layered heated wax box for about one and a half hours. They were then removed, and the excess wax was scraped off with a rubber squeegee before being driven into the foundation. When observed in November 1955, the foundation was intact, the bamboo skin was deep yellow, and both its elasticity and hardness were very high.
    In October 1951, thorny bamboo was used for the handrails of a simple house. The thorny bamboo was first boiled in a mixed solution of 10% calcium chloride, 1% camphor, and 5% table salt for one hour, and then soaked in the same solution overnight. When inspected in December 1953, there were no borer holes inside.
    In May 1948, greenish moso bamboo was used to make bamboo squares. The moso bamboo was first boiled in a mixed liquid of table salt (5%), camphor (50 grams), quicklime (1.5 kilograms), and water (50 kilograms) for two hours before use. When observed in 1951, the bamboo skin was reddish-yellow and had no borers.

　　·大家来献计·
　　三种竹材防腐防虫办法
    过去，我搞过三次竹材防腐防虫的试验，现在把试验中取得较好效果的三种办法提出来供大家参考。
    1953年5月，用老青色毛竹做基础小梁，先把竹材劈开后削成二分之一方的钢筋状竹条，然后用细砂二十五公斤和氯化钙一点三公斤放在隔层加热的铁皮箱内同竹条同时加热，约两小时后，把竹条抽出立即放进溶化的隔层加热腊箱里，约过一小时半取出，用胶皮卡子刮去余腊就打进基础内。1955年11月观察时，基础完整，竹皮深黄色，弹性和硬度都很大。
    1951年10月，用石竹做简易房屋的竹扶手，先把石竹放在氯化钙10％、樟脑1％、食盐5％的混合溶液中煮一小时，然后在原汤内泡一夜。1953年12月检查，内部无蛀虫眼。
    1948年5月，用青色毛竹做竹曲尺，先把毛竹放在食盐（5％）、樟脑（二两）、生石灰（三斤）和水（一百斤）的混合液体中煮两小时后使用。1951年观察时，竹皮红黄色，无蛀虫。
