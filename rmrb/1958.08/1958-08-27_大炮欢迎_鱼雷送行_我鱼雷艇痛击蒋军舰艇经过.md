Xinhua News Agency, Frontline Coast, August 26th: Our frontline reporters Yan Wu and Cheng Peng reported on the battle where our naval torpedo boat unit sank and damaged two Chiang Kai-shek "Zhong"-class warships: On the evening of August 24th, floating clouds drifted in the sky, and the blue sea was calm. The torpedo boat unit of a certain unit of the People's Navy, gathered in a certain bay, suddenly received an order to intercept two Chiang Kai-shek warships reinforcing Kinmen Island southeast of the island.

At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's artillery, entrenched on Kinmen Island, frantically bombarded our Xiamen and Dadeng Island in order to cover the Chiang Kai-shek warships entering Kinmen. Our heroic artillery retaliated fiercely, and the coastal artillery fire concentrated on the enemy ships. Two American-made Chiang Kai-shek transport ships were hit by our artillery fire. They fled frantically to the open sea.

"Trying to escape? Let's give them a 'welcomed with big guns, sent off with torpedoes' treatment!" The sailors of our torpedo boats quickly formed a combat formation and set sail, the boat formation cutting the smooth sea surface into "silver rivers," rushing angrily towards the enemy ships.

When the torpedo boats passed Dongding Island, the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the island frantically intercepted our boat formation with machine guns. At this moment, our coastal artillery fired a volley, and the Chiang Kai-shek positions on Dongding Island immediately turned into a smoke-filled sea of fire, and the machine guns went silent. The sailors on the boats cheered, "Well done, well done!" and accelerated forward.

"Report, enemy ships sighted!" Quartermaster Fu Weifeng suddenly spotted two dark objects on the distant sea in his binoculars.

"Increase speed, prepare for attack!" Boat formation commander Zhang Yimin immediately issued combat orders to each boat.

Instantly, each boat rushed towards the enemy ships like a gust of wind. As our boats approached the enemy ships, the small submarine chasers and minesweepers guarding the enemy's "Zhong"-class warships fiercely opened fire on our boats, and the seawater stirred up by the shells splashed around the boats. Our brave naval heroes, while firing fiercely at the enemy ships with machine guns, advanced bravely through the rain of bullets and the seawater stirred up by the shells, quickly approaching the two largest "Zhong"-class warships of the Chiang Kai-shek forces.

"To eat dragon liver, go down to the sea; to wear tiger skin, climb the mountain." This was the sailors' combat determination. In order to destroy the enemy ships more accurately and ruthlessly, they shortened the distance to the enemy ships again and again.

"Ready—fire!" When the bridge and various structures on the enemy ships appeared before the sailors' eyes, boat captain Cheng Quanmao issued the order to attack.

With a whoosh, two torpedoes drilled into the water, heading straight for the enemy ships. With the loud noise of the torpedoes exploding, the Chiang Kai-shek "Zhong"-class warship that was leading the escape had two "doors" blasted open in its hull, and seawater poured in, instantly like a big dead bear, unable to run any more.

At the same time, the boats commanded by boat captains Wang Qingrui and Dong Fucai also fired torpedoes at the "Zhong"-class enemy ship behind them. Fire burst out on the enemy ship's starboard side, and columns of water rose into the air, the enemy ship engulfed in the smoke of the torpedo explosion.

"Give it another one," boat captain Li Datong of a certain boat behind saw that this dying "big bear" was still struggling to escape, so he fired two more torpedoes at the enemy ship's port side. In an instant, this "big bear" sank to the bottom of the sea with smoke and fire.

The battle was not over yet. Two Chiang Kai-shek small submarine chasers rushed from both sides in an attempt to sandwich our boats. At this time, boat captain Li Datong ordered his boat to rush towards the enemy boats at lightning speed! The cowardly enemy was so frightened that they lost their souls and hurriedly turned around and fled.

Dawn broke, and the morning light reflected a red glow on the rippling sea. The triumphant sailors were warmly congratulated and welcomed by the local people and comrades-in-arms at the dock. (Photo attached)

　　“大炮欢迎  鱼雷送行”
    我鱼雷艇痛击蒋军舰艇经过
    新华社海防前线26日电　本社前线记者阎吾、程鹏报道我海军鱼雷快艇部队击沉击伤两艘蒋军“中”字号军舰的经过情形说：8月24日傍晚，空中飘动着朵朵浮云，蔚蓝色的海面上风平浪静。集结在某海湾的人民海军某部鱼雷快艇部队，突然接到了向金门岛东南海面上两艘由台湾增兵金门的蒋军军舰进行拦击的命令。
    这时，盘踞在金门岛上的蒋军炮兵为掩护蒋军军舰进入金门，向我厦门、大嶝岛等地疯狂轰击。我神勇炮兵予以猛烈还击，海岸炮火集中猛轰敌舰。两艘美造蒋军运输舰都被我炮火击中了。它们仓皇地拼命向外海逃窜。
    “那里逃，给你来个‘大炮欢迎，鱼雷送行’吧！”我鱼雷快艇的水兵们迅速排成战斗队形出航了，艇队把平滑的海面划成一道道的“银河”，愤怒地向敌舰方向飞驰前进。
    当鱼雷快艇驰过东椗岛时，盘踞在岛上的蒋军，用机关炮疯狂地拦击我快艇部队。这时候，我海岸炮兵一阵排炮轰击过去，东椗岛上的蒋军阵地立即变成了硝烟弥漫的火海，机关炮哑了。艇上的水兵们连声欢呼：“打得好，打得好！”并且加快速度向前挺进。
    “报告，发现敌舰！”水手长傅维奉在望远镜里，突然发现远方海面出现了两个黑家伙。
    “加快速度，做好攻击准备！”艇队指挥员张逸民立刻向各艇下达了战斗命令。
    立时，各艇像一阵疾风样地勇猛地向敌舰压去。当我们的快艇快要接近敌舰时，在敌人“中”字号军舰四周担任警戒的小型猎潜艇和扫雷艇，凶恶地向我艇开了火，炮弹激起的海水在快艇四周飞溅。我勇敢的海上英雄们一面用机枪向敌舰猛射，一面穿过弹雨和炮弹击起的海水，勇往直前，迅速地接近蒋军两只最大的“中”字号军舰。
    “要吃龙肝下大海，想穿虎皮上山来。”这是水兵们的战斗决心。他们为了更准更狠地痛歼敌舰，把接近敌舰的距离一次再一次地缩短着。
    “预备——放！”当敌舰上的舰桥和各种建筑物出现在水兵们的眼前时，艇队长程全茂下达了攻击的命令。
    嗖的一声，两条鱼雷钻进水中，直指敌舰飞去。随着鱼雷爆炸后的巨响，在前面带头逃跑的那艘蒋军“中”字号军舰，舰身被轰开两扇“大门”，海水直往里灌，顿时像一只大死熊，再也跑不动了。
    在这同时，艇长王清瑞、董富财分别指挥的快艇，也一齐向着后面那条“中”字号敌舰发射鱼雷了。只见火光在敌舰右舷迸发，水柱腾空，这艘敌舰被鱼雷爆炸后的硝烟吞没了。
    “再给它一家伙”，跟在后面的某号快艇艇长李大同，见到这只奄奄一息的“大熊”还在挣扎着要逃跑时，又向敌舰的左舷发射去两条鱼雷，倾刻间，这个“大熊”带着烟火向海底沉了下去。
    战斗还没有结束。两艘蒋军小型猎潜艇从两侧奔来企图夹攻我快艇。这时，李大同艇长命令他的快艇，神速地向敌艇冲去！胆怯的敌人，被吓得失魄丢魂，急忙转头向后逃去。
    黎明了，晨光在碧波荡漾的海面上映起一片红晕，凯旋归来的水兵们在码头上受到当地人民和战友们的热烈祝贺和欢迎。（附图片）
