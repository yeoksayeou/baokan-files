Grasp the Key Points to Drive the General

Wu Lü

In the Great Leap Forward of the national economy, grain, steel, and machinery serve as the "marshals," and electricity and transportation serve as the "vanguards." Now, the "marshals" have taken command, the "vanguards" are paving the way, and the entire Great Leap Forward army of the national economy has also embarked on its journey. Under this situation, on the one hand, we must continue to vigorously grasp the key points ("marshals" and "vanguards"), and on the other hand, we must also pay attention to driving the general (other departments of the national economy). "Raise one net, and ten thousand meshes open," this is the inevitable trend of development. If the net is not raised, the entire national economy will be difficult to mobilize; if preparations are not made for the situation of "ten thousand meshes opening," the development of the national economy will also be affected. The Ministry of Light Industry's convening of a national conference of directors and chiefs at this current juncture to study the Great Leap Forward in light industry is very timely.

Some comrades do not quite understand the relationship between "net" and "meshes," key points and the general, and even the relationship between "net" and "net," and key points and key points is not very clear. When the policy of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry" was first put forward, didn't some people worry that this would affect the speed of industrial development? Facts have long proved that this worry is unfounded. The implementation of the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry has not only not affected the speed of industrial development, but has greatly accelerated the speed of industrial development. This is because there is an inherent connection of mutual promotion between industry and agriculture. When people's subjective understanding cannot correctly reflect this objective reality, and one aspect is emphasized while the other is neglected, this mutual promotion cannot be well brought into play. The policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously correctly reflects the inherent connections of objective things, and fully brings out this mutual promotion. Why is it that when the "marshals" take command and the "vanguards" pave the way, whether or not light industry should also have a Great Leap Forward becomes a problem in the minds of some comrades? The reason is probably that these comrades lack a deep understanding of the relationship between "net" and "meshes," and key points and the general.

When the net is raised, the meshes open; the key points inevitably drive the general. This is the inevitable law of development. Light industry is neither a "marshal" nor a "vanguard," so it seems worthwhile to consider whether or not it should have a Great Leap Forward. In fact, things are not like this at all. Once the net is raised and the key points are grasped, what is placed before the light industry departments is not the question of whether or not to have a Great Leap Forward, but how to have a Great Leap Forward so as not to fall behind in the ranks of the entire national economic Great Leap Forward. With the grain "marshal" taking command and agriculture achieving a bumper harvest, raw materials are provided for the development of light industry, requiring corresponding development in the textile industry, agricultural product processing industry, oil industry, sugar industry, and other light industries. With the steel "marshal" and the machinery "marshal" taking command, heavy industry is taking a Great Leap Forward step, providing materials and equipment for the development of light industry, and also requiring corresponding development in the salt industry, paper industry, enamel industry, leather industry, glass industry, and other light industries, so as to provide the necessary supporting products for the development of heavy industry. At the same time, due to the rapid development of the entire national economy, the material and cultural life of the people will also gradually improve, which will further require the light industry sector to produce more and better light industrial products. It can be seen that "net" and "meshes," key points and the general, are not mutually isolated, but are mutually connected. When the net is raised, the meshes open; the key points must drive the general. Without key points, the net cannot be raised, and the meshes cannot open. Without the general, there is no such thing as key points. Anyone who cannot see the interrelationship between these two, and isolates them, cannot avoid making mistakes.

So, how exactly should light industry leap forward? Does it mean immediately "ten thousand arrows fired together?" Obviously, needing a leap forward does not mean immediately firing ten thousand arrows together. It is still necessary to develop accordingly under the premise of ensuring that the "marshals" take command and the "vanguards" pave the way, and according to the different needs of various regions. As for the specific approach, as the National Light Industry Bureau Directors Conference pointed out, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, implement the policy of focusing on small-scale, combining large, medium, and small-scale, and focus on indigenous methods, first indigenous then foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign methods.

    抓重点带一般
    吴滤
    在国民经济大跃进中，粮食、钢铁、机械做为“元帅”，电力、交通做为“先行”。现在，“元帅”已经升帐，“先行”正在开路，整个国民经济的跃进大军也已经踏上征途。在这种形势底下，一方面要继续大力抓重点（“元帅”和“先行”），另一方面也要注意带动一般（国民经济的其他部门）。“举一纲，万目张”，这是形势发展的必然趋势。不把纲举起来，整个国民经济难以行动；不为“万目张”的形势预作安排，国民经济的发展也会受到影响。轻工业部在目前这种形势下召开全国厅、局长会议，研究轻工业的跃进问题，是十分适时的。
    有些同志不大了解“纲”和“目”、重点和一般的关系，甚至对“纲”和“纲”，重点和重点之间的关系也不大清楚。“在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举”的方针刚刚提出来的时候，不是就曾有人担心这样一来会不会影响工业发展的速度吗？事实早已证明了这种担心是毫无根据的。实行在优先发展重工业的条件下发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，不但没有影响工业发展的速度，而且大大加快了工业发展的速度。这是因为工业和农业之间本来就存在着互相促进的内在联系，当人们的主观认识不能正确地反映这个客观实际，强调了这一面、忽略了那一面的时候，就不能很好地发挥这种互相促进的作用。发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，正确地反映了客观事物的内在联系，就把这种互相促进的作用充分发挥出来。为什么“元帅”升帐，“先行”开路，轻工业要不要跃进都会在某些同志的思想上成为一个问题呢？原因恐怕也就在于这些同志对“纲”和“目”，重点和一般之间的关系缺乏深刻的认识。
    纲举则目张，重点必然带动一般，这是事物发展的必然规律。轻工业既非“元帅”，又非“先行”，看来要不要跃进确实值得考虑。其实，事情完全不是这样的。纲举起来了，重点抓住了，摆在轻工业部门面前的，根本不是要不要跃进的问题，而是怎样跃进，以免在整个国民经济大跃进的行列中不致于掉队的问题。粮食“元帅”升了帐，农业大丰收，给轻工业的发展提供了原料，要求纺织工业、农产品加工工业、油脂工业、制糖工业等轻工业有相应的发展；钢铁“元帅”和机械“元帅”升了帐，重工业迈开了大跃进的步伐，给轻工业的发展提供了材料和设备，也要求制盐工业、造纸工业、搪瓷工业、制革工业、玻璃工业等轻工业有相应的发展，以便为重工业的发展提供必要的协作产品。同时，由于整个国民经济的迅速发展，人民的物质生活和文化生活也必将逐步提高，这更会要求轻工业部门生产更多更好的轻工业产品。可见，“纲”和“目”，重点和一般，不是互相割裂，而是互相联系的。纲举目张，重点要带动一般，没有重点，举不起纲，目也不能张。没有一般也就无所谓重点。谁要是看不见这两者之间的相互关系，把它们孤立起来，谁就不免要犯错误。
    那么，轻工业究竟怎样跃进？是不是马上就“万箭齐发”呢？显然，需要跃进并不等于马上万箭齐发，总还是要在保证“元帅”升帐和“先行”开路的前提下，根据各地的不同需要，相应发展。至于具体做法，正如全国轻工业厅、局长会议所指出的那样，应该发动群众，贯彻以小型为主，大中小相结合的方针，以土法为主，先土后洋，土洋结合的方针。
