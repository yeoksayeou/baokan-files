Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch: Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, the four major coal mines in Liaoning Province, have overfulfilled their state plans every month for the first seven months of this year, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest in coal production. According to statistics from January to August 20, the four major coal mines produced nearly 20 million tons of coal, exceeding the state plan by more than 4 million tons. Coal production in these seven months and more exceeded the same period last year by 45%; the leap forward plan set by the workers themselves, which was 37% higher than the state plan, was also completed.

Since the beginning of this year, the workers of the four major coal mines in Liaoning have launched a mass upsurge of comparing with the advanced, competing in solid work, and catching up with the advanced, overcoming various difficulties encountered in the production leap forward. Another important factor for the continuous leap forward in production in the four major coal mines in Liaoning is that they boldly abolished some unreasonable rules and regulations during the rectification campaign and launched a vigorous technical innovation movement. After many coal mines implemented the new technology of "multiple blasting at one time," coal mining efficiency generally increased by more than 10%.

Currently, the miners of these four coal mines are concentrating their efforts on carrying out a technological revolution centered on hydraulic coal mining, striving to release a high-yield "satellite" of 4 million tons of coal per month through a major production review in the near future, in order to realize the annual leap forward plan and lay the foundation for a greater leap forward next year.

　　辽宁四大煤矿月月得满分
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票四大煤矿，今年七个月来月月超额完成国家计划，煤炭产量获得空前丰收。据1月到8月20日的统计，四个大煤矿共采出近二千万吨煤，比国家计划多生产了四百多万吨。这七个多月的煤炭产量，超过去年同期45％；职工们自己订的、比国家计划还高37％的跃进计划，也完成了。
    辽宁四大煤矿的职工今年以来掀起了群众性的比先进、比实干、赶先进的热潮，克服了生产跃进中出现的各种困难。辽宁四大煤矿产量不断跃进的另一个重要因素，是在整风中大胆废除了一些不合理的规章制度，开展了蓬勃的技术革新运动。许多煤矿推行“一次多放炮”的新技术以后，采煤效率一般都提高10％以上。
    目前，这四个煤矿的矿工们正在集中力量开展以水力采煤为中心的技术革命，争取最近通过生产大检阅，放出月产四百万吨煤的高产“卫星”，以实现全年的跃进计划，为明年更大的跃进打下基础。
