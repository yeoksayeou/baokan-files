    Iron Ore on the Taihang Mountains

    (Reported by this newspaper) A huge iron ore deposit has recently been discovered in the Taihang Mountains (in Jianping County, Hebei Province). The magnetite grade of this ore is as high as 60% or more, and the lowest is also 30%. The ore body is exposed above the ground for as high as 200 meters, 20 li in length, and 1 li in width, continuously distributed across more than 30 mountain tops. According to preliminary calculations, the reserves in just one location amount to more than 200 million tons of pure iron. Four locations in total have been preliminarily confirmed as valuable.

    This iron ore is not only large in reserves and high in grade, but can also be mined in the open air. It contains very few harmful impurities and is very easy to smelt. (Ding Peizhen, Guo Dian)

    太行山上有铁矿
    本报讯　太行山上（河北省建屏县境内）最近发现一个巨大铁矿。这个矿的磁铁品位高达60％以上，最低也有30％。矿体露出地表高达二百公尺，长二十华里，宽一华里，连续分布山头三十多个。据初步计算，仅一处的储量就达二亿多吨纯铁。初步肯定有价值的共四处。
    这个铁矿不但储量大，品位高，而且可以露天开采。所含有害杂质很少，冶炼也很容易。　（丁培榛、郭甸）
