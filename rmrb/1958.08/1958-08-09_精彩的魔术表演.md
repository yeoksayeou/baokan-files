Among the most exciting are "We Must Liberate Taiwan" and "Listen to Chairman Mao, Follow the Communist Party," "Levitation," "Knife Escape," and "Electrical Magic." "Knife Escape" is a thrilling and exquisite program that appears captivating.

    精彩的魔术表演
    上海张慧冲巨型魔术团从8月6日起在首都劳动剧场演出。共有四十余种大小不同的节目。其中最精彩的有“一定要解放台湾”和“听毛主席的话，跟共产党走”、“空中立人”、“刀遁”和“电流奇术”等。“刀遁”是一个惊险精奇的节目，看来引人入胜。
