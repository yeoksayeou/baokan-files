　　What Dirty Tricks Has the Notorious "Voice of America" Been Up To?

Eisenhower, in his speech at the UN emergency meeting on the 13th, said that one of the problems that should be faced in stabilizing the Middle East situation "is the issue of inflammatory propaganda"; but who exactly is engaged in inflammatory and defamatory propaganda among the people of all countries? It is precisely the United States itself. The notorious "Voice of America" and "Radio Free Europe" are specially established by the United States to engage in this kind of trick.

These two broadcasting organizations, subordinate to the U.S. state apparatus, are an auxiliary mechanism for the United States to carry out subversive propaganda and espionage activities. U.S. Congressman Smith said on January 22nd last year that U.S. policy is to incite the overthrow of the existing system in socialist countries. He said: "We have done this through political platforms, through the 'Voice of America' and 'Radio Free Europe,' and these are just a few of the many paths."

The "Voice of America," with sixteen years of ugly history, is a broadcasting system based in Washington and directly under the U.S. Information Agency. Its foreign propaganda programs are formulated by a so-called "Advisory Committee" composed of "business executives," who are representatives of American financial tycoons Morgan and Rockefeller. As early as 1949, then-U.S. Secretary of State Acheson formulated the "Overall Radio Propaganda Plan," which stipulated that the main task of the "Voice of America" was to "use a vast radio network to fight communism." The "Voice of America" has seventy-eight relay stations at home and abroad, broadcasting various lies and slanders around the clock in forty-three languages, three-quarters of which is used to carry out defamatory and inflammatory propaganda against socialist countries. U.S. Information Agency Director Streibert once said that the "Voice of America" will carry out all necessary work to support so-called "drive for freedom" subversive activities in Eastern European socialist countries.

"Radio Free Europe" is based in West Germany and is "designed by Americans, initiated by Americans, and funded by Americans." Its backstage supporter is Eugene Holman, manager of New Jersey Mobil Oil Company of the Rockefeller Consortium. Among the more than 1,200 staff members it has gathered, the main members are counter-revolutionary elements and traitors who have fled from socialist countries. It is a nest for carrying out incitement and sabotage activities, and also has a so-called "academy" to train these traitors. "Radio Free Europe" began preparations in 1949 and began broadcasting in 1950. It also constantly sends balloons carrying leaflets into the airspace of the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries, inciting riots, strikes, and sabotage activities, and sometimes even broadcasting weapons, explosives, and arson items for direct sabotage activities. During the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riot in October 1956, it actually became the general staff leading the counter-revolutionary riot. A large base in Munich specially dispatched armed agents to Hungary, and these agents performed particularly "well" in the terroristic atrocities of slaughtering peaceful Hungarian residents. On October 31, 1956, it incited and instructed the Hungarian counter-revolutionary elements in this way: "All leaders of the current Hungarian armed forces must be removed from their leading positions." "Don't cool down until the positions of Minister of the Interior and Minister of Defense are in your hands! Don't hang up your guns! Don't give the Budapest government a single piece of coal or a drop of oil!"

In order to achieve the goal of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, the United States has specially established this and many other institutions to carry out rumor-mongering, defamation, and incitement activities. Historically, no country has engaged in "inflammatory propaganda" as shamelessly as the United States. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 臭名远扬的“美国之音”干了些什么肮脏勾当

　　臭名远扬的“美国之音”干了些什么肮脏勾当
    艾森豪威尔13日在联大紧急会议上的演说中，说什么稳定中东局势应当正视的一个问题
  “就是煽动性宣传问题”；可是，究竟是谁在世界各国人民中从事煽动和诽谤的宣传呢？恰好是美国自己。臭名远扬的“美国之音”和
  “自由欧洲”电台就是美国专门建立起来干这种勾当的。
    这两个从属于美国国家机关的广播机构是美国进行颠覆宣传活动和间谍活动的一个辅助机构。美国众议院议员史密斯在去年1月22日就说过，美国的政策就是要煽动推翻社会主义国家现有的制度。他说：“我们已经通过政治讲台，通过‘美国之音’和‘自由欧洲’电台这样做了，这里说的只是几条不多的道路。”
    有着十六年丑恶历史的“美国之音”，是设在华盛顿直属于美国新闻处的一个广播系统。它的国外宣传节目是由所谓“实业界的执行人”组成的“谘询委员会”来制订的，这些人是美国大财阀摩根和洛克菲勒的代表。早在1949年，当时的美国国务卿艾奇逊制订了“总体无线电宣传计划”，就规定“美国之音”的主要任务是“要利用广大的无线电网与共产主义作斗争”。“美国之音”在国内外有七十八个转播站，每天以四十三种语言昼夜不停地散布各种谎言和诽谤，其中四分之三的时间是用来对社会主义国家进行诽谤和煽动宣传的。美国新闻处处长斯特里伯特就曾经说过，
  “美国之音”将进行一切必要的工作，以支持在东欧社会主义国家进行所谓“走向自由”的颠覆性活动。
      “自由欧洲”电台设在西德，是由“美国人设计、美国人发起和美国人出钱办的。”它的后台就是洛克菲勒财团的新泽西美孚油公司经理尤金·赫尔曼。在它搜罗的一千二百多名工作人员中，主要成员是从社会主义国家逃亡的反革命分子和叛徒。它是进行挑拨和破坏活动的巢穴，并且还设立一个训练这些叛徒的所谓“学院”。“自由欧洲”电台从1949年开始筹备，1950年开始播音。它还不断的向苏联和东欧社会主义国家领空放送着带有传单的气球。煽动暴乱、怠工和进行破坏活动，有时还放送直接进行破坏活动的武器、爆炸物和纵火物品等。在1956年10月匈牙利反革命暴乱事件中，它实际上成了领导反革命分子暴乱的参谋部，它设在慕尼黑的一个大本营专门向匈牙利派遣武装特务，这些特务在残杀匈牙利和平居民的恐怖兽行中干得特别“出色”。它在1956年10月31日对匈牙利反革命分子是这样地煽动和指示着：“必须把目前匈牙利武装部队的所有领袖都赶下领导岗位。”“在内务部长和国防部长的职位没有到手以前，你们不要冷下来！不要把枪挂起来！不要给布达佩斯政府一块煤、一滴石油！”
    美国为了达到干涉他国内政的目的，专门建立了这种和其他多种的进行造谣诽谤和煽动活动的机构。历史上还没有一个国家像美国这样无耻地进行“煽动性宣传”的。　　　　　　　（新华社）
