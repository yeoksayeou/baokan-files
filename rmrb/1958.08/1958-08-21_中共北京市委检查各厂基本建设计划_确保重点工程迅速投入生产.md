The Beijing Daily reported that in order to implement the construction policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, building in stages, and producing while building, the Industrial Basic Construction Office of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has reviewed and revised the construction plans of some construction projects. Based on the review results of eleven key construction units such as the First General Machinery Factory, even for key factories, 53% of the civil engineering work this year can be postponed or not built. This will concentrate manpower and resources to ensure the construction progress of key projects, enabling these units to put into production faster and strive for high-speed development of the capital's industry.

This year's industrial construction scale in Beijing is unprecedented, with local industrial investment increasing by 6.7 times compared to 1957. The supply of raw materials, equipment, and construction and installation forces is relatively strained. Under such circumstances, how to arrange construction projects and progress according to priorities and use resources where they are most needed has become an important issue to ensure the high-speed progress of industrial construction.

The Beijing Municipal Committee’s Industrial Basic Construction Office and various local industrial bureaus, according to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, and in conjunction with the preparatory offices of various factories, reviewed and studied the civil engineering designs of eleven major new and expansion projects such as the First and Second General Machinery Factories, Steam Turbine Generator Factory, and Boiler Factory, based on the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The review focused on two issues:

First, implement the principle of producing while building, implement phased construction, and postpone some projects that can be temporarily suspended according to the degree of urgency, concentrating manpower and resources on the first phase of the project, so that it can be put into production as quickly as possible. For example, after the Refractory Materials Factory is built in stages, it will be able to quickly produce refractory materials urgently needed for the development of the metallurgical industry. The First General Machinery Factory originally planned to build two metalworking workshops at once (with different products); now it is concentrating its efforts on building one first. After slightly adjusting the machinery and equipment, the products originally planned for the two workshops can be processed.

Second, use the spirit of working hard and simply, and making do with whatever is available to build factories, and lower those excessively high and inappropriate standards. For example, the main factory building of the Small and Medium-sized Motor Factory is a reinforced concrete structure with a general height of ten meters. In fact, many processes, such as the coil workshop, finished product inspection station, and finished product warehouse, do not require such high construction standards; some processes in some factories can also use open-air operations. In this way, raising where it should be raised and lowering where it should be lowered can save a lot of funds.

In some non-productive living and welfare facilities, resolutely implement the spirit of working hard and simply, and greatly reduce some office buildings, canteens, garages, and other buildings according to actual needs, some not building them at all, and some not building them temporarily, to first ensure productive buildings.

At present, various preparatory units are adjusting and modifying the architectural design according to this spirit.

　　中共北京市委检查各厂基本建设计划
    确保重点工程迅速投入生产
    据北京日报报道  为了贯彻执行勤俭建国、多快好省、分期建设、边建边产的建设方针，中共北京市委工业基本建设办公室审查和修改了一些建设工程的建设计划。根据对第一通用机械厂等十一个重点建设单位的审查结果，即使是重点工厂，今年的土建工程中也有53％的面积可以缓建或者不建。这样就可以集中人力物力来保证重点项目的建设进度，使这些单位更快地投入生产，力争高速度地发展首都的工业。
    今年北京工业建设的规模空前，地方工业的投资额比1957年增加了六点七倍，原材料、设备供应和建筑安装力量相对呈现紧张。在这样的情况下，怎样分别轻重缓急来安排建设项目和进度，把力量使在刀刃上，就成为保证工业建设高速度进展的一个重要问题。
    北京市委工业基建办公室和各地方工业局根据市委指示，会同各厂筹建处，根据多快好省的方针，审查和研究了第一、第二通用机械厂、汽轮发电机厂、锅炉厂等十一个主要新建扩建项目的土建设计。在审查中着重研究了两个问题：
    第一，贯彻执行边建边产的原则，实行分期建设，根据轻重缓急，把一些暂时可不建的项目缓下来，把人力物力集中在第一期工程上，使它能够最快地投入生产。如耐火材料厂分期建设后，就能够迅速生产目前发展冶金工业急需的耐火材料。第一通用机械厂原计划一下建立两个金工车间（产品不同）；现在集中力量先建一个，在把机器设备稍加调整后，原订两个车间的产品都可以加工。
    第二，用穷干苦干、因陋就简的精神来建厂，降低那些过高的不适当的标准。例如中小型电机厂主厂房是钢筋混凝土结构，一般高度为十公尺，其实，其中许多工序如线圈车间、成品检验站、成品库等，并不需要这样高的建筑标准；有的工厂的一些工序还可以采用露天作业。这样该高的高，该低的低，就可以节约大量资金。
    在一些非生产性的生活福利设施中，坚决贯彻穷干苦干精神，把一些办公楼、食堂、汽车库等建筑，根据实际需要，大大削减，有的根本不建，有的暂时不建，以首先保证生产性的建筑。
    目前，各筹建单位正在根据这个精神，调整和修改建筑设计。
