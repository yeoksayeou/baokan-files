Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 27th: The crisis of overproduction is sweeping across all sectors of Japan's economy.

　　In the textile industry, which occupies an important position in the Japanese economy, there is a surplus of everything from products to production equipment. According to Japanese official statistics, despite strict measures to limit production, the inventory of various textiles continued to increase sharply by the end of May; compared with the end of May last year, the inventory of rayon increased by 2.5 times, rayon products increased by 2 times, wool yarn increased by 2.2 times, rayon fiber increased by 64%, cotton yarn increased by 39%, and cotton textiles increased by 21%. In terms of production equipment, based on the production equipment capacity at the end of last year, even without counting the equipment added thereafter, cotton textile equipment was already 12.2% surplus; woolen yarn textile equipment was 24.5% surplus; rayon textile equipment was 26% surplus; and rayon textile equipment was 29% surplus. The crisis in the Japanese textile industry, despite many "rescue" measures taken by the Japanese government and the textile industry in the past year, has not shown any signs of "improvement" but has instead become increasingly serious.

　　The Japanese steel industry, which made a fortune during the Korean War and continued to increase production until 1957, is now increasingly mired in a crisis of overproduction. According to materials recently published by the Japan Steel Club, although the production of various steel products has been reduced by an average of 30%-40% since March of this year, the inventory of these steel products remained at 770,000 tons during the period from April to June. It has been announced that the production of these steel products will continue to reduce the operating rate from July to September, with pig iron production reduced by 43,000 tons and steel production reduced by 32,000 tons. However, due to the increasingly narrow outlets in domestic and foreign markets, the inventory of these steel products is estimated to increase to 800,000 tons instead.

　　The serious overcapacity of the shipbuilding industry has caused extreme concern in the Japanese economic circles. Currently, Japan's shipbuilding capacity has reached 2.5 million tons. The production of export ships, which stimulated the rapid development of Japan's shipbuilding industry, once surged from 165,000 tons in fiscal year 1953 to 5,676,600 tons during the period from 1954 to 1957. However, in the current situation where the entire capitalist world shipping industry is facing a crisis, Japanese shipbuilding industry insiders have recently worried that it would be good if Japan's export ships can reach 200,000 to 300,000 tons this year; and according to Japan's existing shipbuilding equipment capacity, the Japanese shipbuilding industry needs 1,042,000 tons of export ship orders this year to fully operate these equipment.

　　According to materials revealed from various sources, the phenomena of overproduction and overcapacity are also very serious in other industries:

　　Among the ocean-going ships with a total tonnage of 3.85 million tons with 3,000 tons or more, 10% are surplus ships;

　　Of the 53.5 million tons of coal planned to be produced this year, 4.5 million tons will be unsalable; coupled with the coal stored in the hands of users, Japan will have 10 million tons of coal in stock this year;

　　In July this year, there was a surplus of 270,000 tons of ammonium sulfate products and a surplus of 110,000 tons of urea products; it is estimated that the demand for these products in domestic and foreign markets in the second half of this year will not increase, but will continue to decrease;

　　The paper industry also has overcapacity, and even the equipment for manufacturing the always popular high-grade paper is 10% idle.

### 开工率缩减又缩减　库存量增加再增加  日本生产过剩危机无孔不入

　　开工率缩减又缩减　库存量增加再增加
    日本生产过剩危机无孔不入
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：生产过剩的危机正在席卷日本的各个经济部门。
    在日本经济中占重要地位的纺织业，从产品到生产设备都存在着过剩现象。据日本官方统计，尽管采取了严格措施来限制生产，但是到5月底为止，各种纺织品的库存量仍然在急剧增加；同去年5月底相比，人造丝的库存量增加了二点五倍，人造纤维制品增加了二倍，毛线增加了二点二倍，人造纤维增加了64％，棉线增加了39％，棉纺织品增加了21％。在生产设备方面，按去年年底的生产设备能力计算，即使不计入其后增加的设备，棉纺织设备已经过剩12.2％；粗毛线纺织设备过剩24.5％；人造棉纺织设备过剩26％；人造丝纺织设备过剩29％。日本纺织业这次发生的危机虽经日本政府和纺织业界在过去一年中采取了许多“解救”的措施，不但没有“好转”迹象，而且发展得日益严重。
    在朝鲜战争中大发横财、直至1957年生产还在不断上升的日本钢铁业，目前也日益严重地陷入生产过剩的危机中。据日本“钢材俱乐部”不久前发表的材料，尽管从今年3月开始，生产各种钢铁产品的设备已经平均缩减开工率30％—40％；但是，在4至6月这一期间，这些钢铁产品的库存量仍然保持在七十七万吨。据宣布，生产这些钢铁产品的设备在7至9月还要继续缩减开工率，高炉生铁将减产四万三千吨、钢材将减产三万二千吨。但是，由于国内外市场出路日益狭窄，这些钢铁产品的库存量估计反而要增加到八十万吨。
    造船业生产设备能力的严重过剩已经使日本经济界感到极度忧虑。目前日本的造船能力已经达到二百五十万吨。刺激日本造船业迅速发展的出口船舶的生产量曾经一度从1953年度的十六万五千吨剧增到1954年至1957年这一期间的五百六十七万六千吨。但是，在目前整个资本主义世界海运业面临危机的情况下，近来日本造船业界人士忧愁地认为，今年日本出口船舶能够达到二十万至三十万吨就算是好的了；而根据日本已有的造船设备能力，日本造船业今年度需要有一百零四万二千吨的出口船舶订货，才能使这些设备完全开工。
    据各方面透露的材料，在其他行业中，生产过剩和设备能力过剩的现象也十分严重：
    在总吨数有三百八十五万吨的三千吨以上的远洋船中，有10％是过剩船只；
    今年计划生产的五千三百五十万吨煤中，将有四百五十万吨滞销；再加上用户手中存煤，日本今年积压的煤将达一千万吨；
    今年7月份的硫酸胺产品过剩二十七万吨、尿素产品过剩十一万吨；据估计，今年下半年国内外市场对这些产品的需要将不是增加，而是继续减少；
    造纸业也存在生产设备过剩现象，甚至制造一向畅销的高级纸张的设备也有10％空闲着。
