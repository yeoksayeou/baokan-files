Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch. According to a report by United Press International: On the 29th, a rebel group led by former Haitian Army Captain Basquiat seized the barracks in the capital, Port-au-Prince, attempting to launch a coup. After several hours of fighting, the rebellion was quelled. Ten rebels were killed, including two Americans, one of whom was a former US Air Force attaché to Haiti.

On July 28, Haitian Minister Without Portfolio Brunson said at a press conference in New York that US Ambassador to Haiti Drew was "openly interfering in the internal affairs of the Republic."

A United Press International reporter pointed out: "The attempted coup in Haiti was launched after the Haitian government requested Drew's recall."

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch. According to a recent report in the Brazilian "Workers' Voice," US Secretary of State Dulles' scheduled visit to Brazil on August 5 has caused dissatisfaction among people from all walks of life. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has colluded with the Brazilian police authorities to intensify espionage activities, attempting to use violent means to deal with the Brazilian people.

The newspaper said that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation is sending a group of secret agents to Brazil. The US Embassy in Brazil has sent Colonel Danilo of the Brazilian police a list containing the names of people who are said to be participating in anti-Dulles demonstrations. At the same time, telegrams from Washington and New York have been constantly warning the Brazilian government to take "security measures before Dulles' visit." Now, under the instructions of the US Embassy, Colonel Danilo is spreading various sensational arguments, creating a tense atmosphere in order to take violent measures against the Communist Party and other patriotic and democratic forces.

The newspaper emphasized: "The police have no way to suppress the dissatisfaction of millions of Brazilians with the consequences of the US Secretary of State's policies. This is not a personal dislike for Dulles... but a dislike for everything he represents: America's war policy and colonialism. We are vigilantly opposing this policy and rejecting this policy - just as the patriots of other Latin American countries expressed to (US Vice President) Nixon, who visited these countries in April and May."

The newspaper protested against the US actions, saying: "We are not an occupied country, and the US Embassy is providing the police with a list of Brazilians so that Dulles can come to Brazil and use arbitrary violence against these people. This practice is intolerable to us."

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch. According to TASS New York, 29th dispatch: A delegation for independence, headed by the chairman of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, Senator Gracia, held a press conference at which they distributed documents addressed to the US Congress and the State Department, demanding independence for Puerto Rico.

The document emphasized that despite the US propaganda machine saying that Puerto Rico enjoys "freedom under the American flag," it is actually still a colony under US rule. Puerto Rico's sovereignty has been deprived, and all aspects of domestic life are placed under the control of US legislative and executive bodies.

The document said that the Puerto Rican delegation for independence is asking the US Congress to quickly pass a fair resolution. Puerto Rico's right to independence, especially the interests of Latin America, requires the US Congress to pass a resolution that meets the legitimate demands of the people.

Gracia said at the press conference that the delegation he leads will visit Latin American countries in order to gain support for the Puerto Rican people's struggle for independence.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch. According to TASS New York, 30th dispatch: News from Central America confirms that US President's brother Milton Eisenhower's mission in the Caribbean region has failed. According to a report from Central America by a reporter for the "Christian Science Monitor," Milton Eisenhower, who is "about to end" his trip, is now even more convinced that "the region's criticism of the United States is much stronger than it was during his visit to South America in 1953."

    拉丁美洲反抗美国殖民政策
    美国颠覆海地政府的阴谋遭到惨败
    巴西舆论不许美国干涉内政　波多黎各人民要求独立
    新华社31日讯　据合众国际社报道：29日海地前陆军上尉巴斯基领导的叛乱集团夺取了首都太子港的兵营，企图发动政变，经过几小时的战斗，叛乱被平复。十名叛乱分子被击毙，其中有两名美国人，有一个是前美国驻海地的空军武官。
    7月28日海地不管部长布朗塞在纽约举行的记者招待会上说，美国驻海地大使德鲁“公开干涉共和国的内政”。
    合众国际社记者指出：“海地的政变企图是在海地政府要求召回德鲁之后发动的。”
    新华社31日讯　据巴西“工人呼声报”不久以前报道，由于美国国务卿杜勒斯预定在8月5日访问巴西而在各界人士中引起不满，美国联邦调查局已经串同巴西警察当局加紧进行特务活动，企图用暴力手段来对付巴西人民。
    报纸说，美国联邦调查局正在派一批密探到巴西去。驻巴西的美国大使馆已经给巴西警察局的丹尼洛上校送去一份名单，其中列入了据说要参加反杜勒斯示威的人。同时，来自华盛顿和纽约的电报不断警告巴西政府，要它“在杜勒斯访问之前采取安全措施”。现在，丹尼洛上校在美国大使馆的指使下，正在散布种种耸人听闻的论调，制造紧张空气，以便采取暴力手段来对付共产党以及其他爱国民主力量。
    报纸强调说：“警察没有办法压制千百万巴西人对美国国务卿的政策后果的不满情绪。这不是对杜勒斯个人的恶感……而是不喜欢他所代表的一切：美国的战争政策和殖民主义。我们在警惕地反对这种政策，拒绝这种政策——就像拉丁美洲其他国家的爱国者对（4、5月间访问这些国家的美国副总统）尼克松所表示的那样。”
    报纸对美国的作法提出抗议说：“我们不是一个被占领国，美国大使馆竟向警察局提供巴西人的名单，好让杜勒斯能到巴西来而用专横的暴力来对付这些人。这种做法是我们不能容忍的。”
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约29日讯：以波多黎各独立党主席、参议员格拉西亚为首的争取独立使团举行了记者招待会，在会上分发了写给美国国会和国务院的文件，要求给予波多黎各以独立。
    文件着重指出，尽管美国的宣传机构说波多黎各享受着“美国旗帜下的自由”，实际上它仍然是美国统治下的殖民地。波多黎各的主权被剥夺，国内全部生活都置于美国立法和执行机关的控制之下。
    文件说，波多黎各争取独立使团要求美国国会迅速通过公正的决议。波多黎各的独立权利，特别是拉丁美洲的利益，要求美国国会通过符合人民合法要求的决议。
    格拉西亚在记者招待会上说，他所领导的使团将到拉丁美洲各国去访问，以便取得对波多黎各人民争取独立运动的声援。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约30日讯：来自中美洲的消息证实美国总统的兄弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔在加勒比海这个地区的使命已经遭到失败。据“基督教科学箴言报”记者自中美洲报道，“就要结束”旅行的密尔顿·艾森豪威尔现在更加确信“这个地区对美国的抨击比他在1953年访问南美洲时强烈得多了”。
