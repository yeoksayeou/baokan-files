Editor's Note

　　We organized some comrades from Yongfengtun Township, Changping District, Beijing, to write articles reflecting their progress in culture, education, and health, because the people in the township have made achievements in learning culture. Through these reports, we can see the tremendous cultural changes in the countryside during the Great Leap Forward. Secretary Yu Liansheng not only vividly described the current active cultural atmosphere in the township in his article, but also confidently predicted the bright future. An old farmer, who was originally illiterate, narrated his experience of learning culture. He now writes everywhere, saying that his hands are always itchy and he wants to write, and he even wants to go to university. Music workers have discovered that the children in the newly established music primary school have a very strong sense of music and can distinguish between silk strings and various altered tones. Many are exciting new people and new things. The great cultural revolution will undoubtedly bring continuous miracles to our countryside.

　　编后小语
    北京市昌平区永丰屯乡人民学文化有成绩，我们就地组织了这个乡的一些同志写文章来反映他们在文教卫生方面的进展情况。通过这些报道，我们可以看出跃进中的农村在文化上的巨大变化。书记于连生在他的文章里不仅生动地写出了当前乡里文化生活的活跃气氛，而且充满信心地预计到将来的美好远景。原来不识字的老农民口述了他的学文化的经历，他现在到处写字，他说老是手痒痒的想写，并且还想上大学。音乐工作者发现刚办的音乐小学里的孩子，音乐感非常强，能辨别丝弦和各种变化音。不少都是令人兴奋的新人新事。伟大的文化革命无疑将使我们的农村不断地出现奇迹。
