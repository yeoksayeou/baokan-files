　　Xiangxi Nationalities Overcome Superstition and Emancipate the Mind
　　Striving to Innovate Technology to Catch Up with Advanced Nationalities
　　(Our dispatch) This reporter Long Wenming reports: The CPC Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee of Hunan Province, based on the characteristics of mountainous and ethnic areas, adopted a series of effective measures to lead the farmers of all nationalities in the prefecture to overcome superstition, emancipate their minds, learn from experiences in other places, strive to innovate technology, implement intensive cultivation, and catch up with advanced nationalities in this year's Great Leap Forward in production.
　　Xiangxi has always been a remote mountainous area with very low grain yields. Before liberation, more than 700,000 Tujia and Miao farmers, who lived in these mountains and ridges, cultivated the land very extensively. After sowing each year, they neither cultivated nor weeded, nor did they apply fertilizer. Some areas still maintained the primitive production habit of "slash-and-burn agriculture." Therefore, before liberation, the rice fields in this mountainous area generally only yielded more than 100 jin per mu, and dry land generally only yielded 40 to 50 jin. After liberation, under the glorious illumination of the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, farmers of all nationalities learned many advanced farming experiences from other places. Last year, the prefecture's grain output had increased to 1.13 billion jin, an average of 391 jin per mu. However, these advanced farming experiences were mostly promoted in small plains and hilly areas in valleys, and not much in the large mountainous areas where ethnic minorities lived.
　　This year, the various construction works of the autonomous prefecture, like those in other parts of the country, have also developed rapidly. Encouraged by this new situation, farmers of all nationalities put forward the fighting slogan of "hard work for three years to change the face of the mountainous area," and decided to completely eliminate the crude and backward habits of cultivation this year, implement dense planting on 2.1 million mu of rice paddies, promote wide-row double-plant dense planting on 600,000 mu of corn, expand the multiple cropping area to 200%, and strive for a bumper harvest this year.
　　Starting last winter, the prefectural committee led farmers of all nationalities to learn from the experience of the Han areas in building water conservancy projects, and built large-scale water conservancy projects. After a winter and a spring of hard work, the prefecture built more than 96,000 water conservancy projects, exceeding the total number of water conservancy projects built in the eight years since liberation. This mountainous area, where two-thirds were drought-prone terraced fields before liberation, now has 70.3% of its rice fields that can resist drought for 30 to 60 days. This spring, the prefectural committee again led farmers of all nationalities to learn from Liling's "four diligences and eight haves" experience in accumulating fertilizer, first covering the 600,000 mu of lean land in the prefecture with a thick layer of black mud fertilizer, turning all of them into fertile fields. Dotted like stars, the "dunfei" (compost ponds) this year are for the first time covering the fields of the autonomous prefecture. This mountainous area, which had no habit of fertilization before liberation and averaged only 50 dan of fertilizer per mu last year, now averages 486 dan per mu this year. In order to cultivate deeply and plant densely, the prefecture promoted a total of 1,657 double-wheel double-blade plows this year, created 599 wooden double-blade plows, transformed old plows into new plows, and various improved plows, 147,755 pieces, generally plowing from about four inches deep last year to six or seven inches deep this year.
　　The tremendous achievements made by the autonomous prefecture in more than half a year are mainly due to the adoption of the following measures: (1) Reading the newspaper every day, innovating every day, and setting off a high tide of learning from experiences in other places. Since last winter, the prefectural committee has called on cadres and farmers of all nationalities to read newspapers, study, broaden their horizons, and learn technology, taking reading newspapers as one of the main driving forces for promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. Reading the newspaper every day was first implemented by the CPC Longtan Township Committee of Huayuan County and the First Secretary Wu Yuansheng (Miao nationality). Under his influence, the cadres of this township also developed the habit of reading newspapers. They learned many advanced experiences and leadership methods from the newspapers. In order to realize the goal of making 90% of the rice fields in the Qianjin Township free from drought and flood, and applying 700 dan of fertilizer per mu, and transforming the "experimental fields" from Qiu Yuejin to demonstration zones, they powerfully promoted the overall Great Leap Forward in production in this Miao mountainous township, solved the long-standing problem of the township cadres' study, and improved the political thinking of cadres and the masses, so that everyone's thinking was liberated. In mid-April, based on the experience of this township, the prefectural committee organized the entire prefecture to carry out the "Everyone should read three newspapers, and everyone should study two subjects (culture, science)" campaign, instructing the party committee secretaries at all levels to personally take command, take the lead in learning, mobilize the whole party, and carry out a revolutionary competition to compare indicators, measures, drive, wisdom, learning, technological innovation, and political and ideological leadership. Now, within the entire prefecture, every township (some communes) has the People's Daily, every commune has the New Hunan Daily, and every team has the Unity Daily. Whether in the fields or on the construction site, as soon as there is a break, the newspaper reader takes out the newspaper and reads aloud.
　　(2) Frequently sending people out to learn and explore for treasures. Farmers of ethnic minorities who live in the deep mountains pay very close attention to practical matters when it comes to new things, due to geographical constraints. In order to consolidate the experiences they learned from newspapers, broaden their horizons, and liberate their minds more thoroughly and deeply, the prefectural committee organized visiting groups to visit Liling and Hong'an and other places several times. The farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture, who lacked the habit of accumulating and conserving fertilizer, have achieved remarkable results in collecting household fertilizer throughout the prefecture since returning from learning the "four diligences and eight haves" experience of fertilizer accumulation and conservation in Liling. Especially after learning the experience of planting experimental fields in Hong'an, cadres at the county, township, commune, and team levels all planted experimental fields.
　　(3) Focusing on demonstration and comprehensively promoting. When a good foreign experience is brought to a backward mountainous area for promotion, it needs to be done carefully, both to make ethnic minority farmers understand its benefits and to have methods for promotion. To this end, party committee secretaries at all levels in the autonomous prefecture established high-yield experimental bases at each level to create and promote experience. According to incomplete statistics, there are 1,640 various experimental bases established in the prefecture this year. For example, for dense planting of rice, half a month before transplanting, the prefectural and county committees first used thatch and rice straw for trial planting at the base, and after gaining experience, the county committees of each county immediately convened township party committees for trial planting, and then promoted it to general cadres, commune and team cadres, and young and old farmers. In just half a month, the prefecture trained more than 100,000 dense-planting rice transplanters of all nationalities, ensuring that all rice fields were densely planted on time and according to plan.
　　(4) Using the method of holding on-the-spot meetings to conduct self-education among the masses with successful examples; this is particularly effective among farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture who value practicality.
　　(5) In order to further make the innovation of the farming system a mass movement, various "technical lecture groups" have been established in various parts of the autonomous prefecture, with cadres, technicians, and old farmers with agricultural technical knowledge and practical production experience serving as members, adopting the method of "speaking about what you do," and dispersing to various mountain villages to teach the farmers of all ethnic groups knowledge of agricultural technical innovation.
　　(6) In order to better promote and learn from foreign experiences, all counties and townships in the autonomous prefecture have established mountain technical innovation committees with the party committee secretary serving as the director, and absorbing cadres, technicians, old farmers, and handicraft workers to participate. According to incomplete statistics, with the help and promotion of the technical innovation committees at all levels, the farmers of all nationalities in the prefecture have created, invented, and imitated more than 410,000 pieces of vehicles, plows, dense planting equipment, etc., basically solving the difficulty of insufficient labor during this spring's busy farming season.

　　·Editor's Note·
　　Transforming Backwardness into Advancement
　　Due to historical reasons, the work in ethnic minority areas is indeed much more backward than that in Han areas. However, no matter how backward the ethnic minority areas were in the past, today, ethnic minority brothers and sisters, like the people of the whole country, have a common requirement: to take the road of socialism and live a happy and fulfilling life.
　　The leading organs and leading cadres in ethnic minority areas should not only see the characteristic of backwardness in ethnic minority areas, but also see the common and essential requirements of all ethnic groups. However, it is not enough to just see, but also to think of all possible ways and take all possible measures to lead the people of ethnic minorities to realize this common requirement and transform backwardness into advancement!
　　The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee has provided a model. They not only saw the characteristics and common requirements of ethnic minority areas, but also took a series of measures to help ethnic minorities overcome superstition, liberate their minds, learn from advanced experiences in other places, and strive to catch up with advanced nationalities. As a result, in just over half a year, they changed the face of the mountainous area. This is the correct approach of the promoting faction, and it is worthy of learning by other regions.

　　湘西各族人民破除迷信解放思想
　　努力革新技术直追先进民族
    本报讯　记者龙文明报道：中共湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州地委根据山区和民族地区特点，采取一系列有效措施，领导全州各族农民在今年生产大跃进中，破除迷信，解放思想，学习外地经验，努力革新技术，实行精耕细作，直追先进民族。
    湘西历来就是一个粮食产量很低的偏僻山区。解放前，聚居在这个丛山峻岭中的七十多万土家族、苗族农民，耕作非常粗放，每年播种过后，既不中耕锄草，也不追施肥料。有一部分地区还保持着“刀耕火种”的原始生产习惯。因此在解放前，这个山区的稻田一般每亩只收一百多斤，旱地一般只收四、五十斤。解放后，在中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，各族农民学到外地很多的先进耕作经验。去年全州的粮食产量已增到十一亿三千万斤，平均每亩收三百九十一斤。但是，这些先进耕作经验，多半在山谷小平原和丘陵地区推广，在少数民族聚居的大山区就推广不多。
    今年，自治州的各项建设工作，也同全国各地一样飞跃发展。在这新形势的鼓舞下，各族农民提出“苦战三年，改变山区面貌”的战斗口号，并决定今年全部革除耕作粗放陋习，二百一十万亩水稻实行密植，六十万亩包谷推广宽行双株密植，复种面积扩大到200％，争取今年大丰收。
    从去冬开始，地委领导各族农民学习汉族地区兴修水利的经验，大修水利。经过一冬一春的苦干，全州兴修的水利工程就达九万六千多处，超过解放八年来所修水利工程的总和。这个在解放前有三分之二是干旱梯田的山区，现在已有70.3％的稻田能抗旱三十至六十天。今年春天，地委又领导各族农民学习醴陵“四勤八有”的积肥经验，首先把全州的六十万亩瘦田，铺上一层厚厚的污黑肥泥，全部变成肥田。密如星斗的凼肥，今年第一次布满在自治州的田里。这个在解放前没有施肥习惯而去年每亩平均只施五十担肥料的山区，今年平均每亩达四百八十六担。为了深耕密植，全州今年共推广双轮双铧犁一千六百五十七部，创造木质双铧犁五百九十九部，旧犁改新犁、各种改良犁十四万七千七百五十五部，普遍从去年的四寸左右深耕到六、七寸。
    自治州在半年多取得的巨大成绩，主要是由于采取了这样几项措施：（一）天天读报，日日革新，掀起学习外地经验的高潮。去冬以来，地委号召各族干部和各族农民，人人看报，个个读书，扩大眼界，学习技术，把读报作为推动生产大跃进的主要动力之一。天天读报，首先是由中共花垣县龙潭乡委员会和第一书记吴元生（苗族）开始实行的。这个乡的干部在他的影响下也养成了读报的习惯。他们从报纸上学到了外地的许多先进经验和领导方法。他们为实现千斤乡已做到90％的稻田水旱无虞，每亩施肥七百担，“试验田”由丘跃进到示范区，有力地促进了这个苗族山乡的全面生产大跃进，解决了长久难以解决的乡干部的学习问题，提高了干部和群众的政治思想，使人人思想得到了解放。4月中旬，地委根据这个乡的经验，组织全州开展“人人要看三份报，个个要读两门书（文化、科学）”运动，指示各级党委书记必须亲自挂帅，带头学习，全党动员，来一个比指标、比措施、比干劲、比智慧、比学习、比技术革新、比政治思想领导的革命竞赛。现在，在全州范围内，乡乡（部分社）有人民日报，社社有新湖南报，队队有团结报。不管在田间或工地，只要一休息，读报员就掏出报纸朗读。
      （二）经常派人外出取经探宝。聚居在深山里的少数民族农民，由于地理条件的限制，他们对新的事物非常讲究实际。为了巩固他们从报纸上学到的经验，把眼界扩得更大，思想解放得更透更深，地委曾好几次组织参观团到醴陵和红安等地参观。缺乏积肥保肥习惯的自治州各族农民，自从去醴陵学到“四勤八有”的积肥保肥经验回来以后，全州收集家肥工作获得了显著的成绩。特别到红安学了种试验田的经验回来以后，县、乡、社、队干部都种了试验田。
      （三）重点示范，全面推广。一件好的外地经验拿到落后的山区来推广，需要慎重从事，既要使少数民族农民懂得它的好处，又要有推广的办法。为此，自治州各级党委书记层层建立了丰产试验基地，创造和推广经验。据不完全统计，今年全州建立的各种试验基地有一千六百四十处。如水稻密植，在插秧前半个月，地委和县委就先在基地用芭茅、稻草作了试插，取得经验后，各县县委立即召集乡党委试插，然后再推广到一般干部、社队干部和青年、老农中去，仅在半个月时间内，全州就培训出各族密植插秧手十多万人，保证了全部稻田按时按计划密植。
      （四）用开现场会议的方法，以成功的事例在群众中进行自我教育；这在讲求实际的自治州各族农民中，特别行之有效。
    （五）为了进一步使耕作制度革新工作成为群众性的运动，自治州各地先后成立了许多各种各样的“技术讲授团”，由具有农业技术知识和实际生产经验的干部、技术员、老农担任团员，采取“干什么讲什么”的方法，分散到各个山寨给各族农民讲授农业技术革新知识。
      （六）为了更好地推广和学习外地经验，自治州各县、乡都成立了由党委书记担任主任委员的山区技术革新委员会，吸收干部、技术员、老农和手工业者参加。据不完全统计，在各级技术革新委员会的帮助和推动下，全州各族农民创造、发明、仿造的车辆、犁、密植器等共有四十一万多件，基本上解决了今春农忙时劳力不足的困难。

　　变落后为先进
    少数民族地区的工作，由于历史的原因，比起汉族地区来，确实是要落后得多。但是，不管少数民族地区过去如何落后，今天，少数民族兄弟和全国人民一样，都有一个共同的要求：走社会主义的路，过幸福美满的生活。
    少数民族地区的领导机关和领导干部，不但要看到少数民族地区落后这个特点，而且更应该看到各族人民共同的、本质的要求。但光是看到还不够，还应该想尽一切办法，采取一切措施来领导少数民族人民实现这个共同的要求，变落后为先进！
    湘西土家族苗族自治州地委，就提供了一个典范。他们不但看到了少数民族地区的特点和共同的要求，而且采取了一系列的措施，帮助少数民族破除迷信、解放思想，学习外地先进经验，努力追赶先进民族。结果，在短短的半年多时间里，就改变了山区的面貌。这是正确的促进派的做法，值得其他地区学习。
