Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd August: The Second Commercial Department recently held an on-site meeting in Jiutai County, Jilin Province, to promote the experience of the Jiutai County Commercial Bureau in building a 200-ton (capacity) cold storage facility in thirty-six days using both indigenous and foreign methods.

The volume of goods handled by commercial departments is growing rapidly, but the construction of cold storage facilities is restricted by many conservative ideas. These conservative ideas include "six impossibilities": it is impossible without steel and cement; it is impossible without seamless steel pipes; it is impossible if the cost per ton (of capacity) is less than 800 yuan; it is impossible without cork or foam cement; it is impossible without a year's time; it is impossible without technical expertise.

The Jiutai County Commercial Bureau used indigenous and foreign methods to build its cold storage facility. They used an old brick building as a warehouse; lacking insulating materials such as cork and foam cement, they used locally produced pumice, rice husks, and coal cinder as substitutes; lacking sufficient seamless steel pipes, they used cast iron pipes and ceramic radiators instead. The total cost was only 45,000 yuan, and the construction period was short, in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. After evaluation, it fully meets the standards.

    用土洋并举办法建冷藏库
    据新华社长春3日电  第二商业部最近在吉林省九台县召开现场会议，推广九台县商业局土洋并举，三十六天建成一座二百吨（容量）冷藏库的经验。
    商业部门的商品经营量增长的很快，但是要兴建冷藏库，又受着许多保守思想的束缚。保守思想有“六不能”，即：没有钢筋水泥不能，没有无缝钢管不能，每吨（容量）造价少了八百元不能，没有软木或泡沫水泥不能，没有一年时间不能，没有技术力量不能。
    九台县商业局，用土洋并举的办法来建设冷藏库。他们用一座旧砖房来代替库房；没有软木和泡沫水泥等绝缘材料，就用本地出产的浮石、稻糠和煤渣来代替；无缝钢管不足，就用铸铁管和陶瓷暖气片代替。这样全部造价仅四万五千元，施工期也短，符合多快好省的方针，经鉴定完全合乎标准。
