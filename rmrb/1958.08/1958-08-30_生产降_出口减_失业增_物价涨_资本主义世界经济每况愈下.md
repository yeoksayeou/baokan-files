Xinhua News Agency, August 29th dispatch from London via TASS: Increasing signs indicate that the British economy is deteriorating daily.

This is now acknowledged not only by influential newspapers but also by high-ranking political figures and people in finance and industry.

The "Manchester Guardian" believes that "there are many signs that an economic recession will occur in the autumn, and unemployment will increase."

According to official British figures, the average monthly index of industrial production for the first half of this year (with 1948 as 100) was two points lower than the average index for the same period last year. The index for June this year was 134, eight points lower than in June last year.

The decline in production is particularly evident in the steel, textile, and coal industries. According to "The Economist" magazine, weekly steel production in July this year decreased by 13% compared to July last year, and steel exports decreased by nearly a quarter. Currently, the operating rate of British steel companies is only 80%.

The "Financial Times" wrote that the decline in textile production is "very sharp." According to statistics from the "Board of Trade Journal," a publication of the Board of Trade, cotton textile production decreased by 9% in the first half of this year. Wool fabric production in the first five months of this year decreased by 14% compared to the same period last year.

Coal mining output in British mines in June was 7% lower than the 1957 level.

Residential and industrial construction are also decreasing. The number of homes built in the first quarter of this year decreased by 15% compared to the same period last year.

Despite the British government's best efforts to expand exports, the total value of British exports (calculated at prices) in the first seven months of this year was still 4% lower than the same period last year. Exports to Western European countries in the first half of the year decreased by 13.7% compared to last year, and even exports to Sterling Area countries decreased by 1.6%.

Capitalists are shifting the consequences of the production decline to the working class by laying off workers and lowering real wages. According to the Treasury, the number of workers in the national economy decreased by 165,000 from January to June 1958, of which 152,000 were employees in the processing industry. In July this year, the number of unemployed people in Britain exceeded 450,000, setting a post-war record. British trade union leaders estimate that the number of unemployed workers in Britain may increase to 750,000 by January next year.

Even official statistics acknowledge that British workers' real wages are decreasing due to rising prices in 1958. The "Financial Times" commented that "even if a worker can maintain his position in production, he will feel that his actual income is clearly decreasing. At the same time, behind the average figures, the situation of unskilled workers (wage income) is deteriorating unprecedentedly."

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th dispatch from German News Agency: Materials recently published by the West German Railway Administration show that both freight and passenger transport on West German railways decreased in the first half of this year. Among them, freight volume decreased by 12.6% compared to the first half of last year, and passenger volume decreased by 14.4%.

It is said that the decrease in railway transport volume is a result of the deteriorating West German economy, especially the coal industry crisis.

According to West German newspapers, due to the sharp decline in transport volume, the West German Railway Administration will lose at least one billion marks this year. Now, the West German Railway Administration is planning to make up for the losses by laying off railway employees. There are reports that it plans to lay off 5,000 people in the first batch.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch TASS Buenos Aires, August 26th: Prices in Argentina continue to soar. The prices of food and necessities are still rising. According to materials from "Que" magazine, food prices alone increased by 28.4% from January to July this year, clothing prices increased by 17.5%, and general expenses increased by 26.6%.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 29th dispatch: As the economic crisis deepens, Japan's unemployment problem is becoming increasingly serious.

According to statistics from the Japanese Prime Minister's Office, the average number of fully unemployed people from January to June this year remained at 600,000 per month, an increase of 17,000 people compared to the same period last year; June alone increased by 80,000 fully unemployed people compared to May.

According to a survey by the Ministry of Labor, an average of 670 companies per month underwent "restructuring" (including liquidation, suspension of business, and bankruptcy) in the first half of this year, an increase of 3.47 times compared to the same period last year; an average of 27,000 people per month were affected by "restructuring" (various forms of layoffs), an increase of 3.3 times compared to the same period last year.

Official Japanese statistics also show that the average number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the first half of this year was 471,000 per month, an increase of 47.7% compared to the same period last year.

According to Japanese newspaper materials, the unemployment situation will continue to worsen.

In the coal mining industry, 30,000 people will be laid off or suspended by the end of this year; in steel companies, at least 3,000 more people will be laid off by the end of this year; in machinery manufacturing, chemical, paper, shipbuilding, textile, and other enterprises, layoffs will continue in the second half of this year.

A recent issue of "Avant-Garde" magazine pointed out that the actual number of unemployed people in Japan is currently equivalent to one fully unemployed person for every two households.

The economic crisis has also made life more difficult for Japanese employees who have fortunately avoided being laid off. The wages of many employees have been deducted by the capitalists. According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the number of people who could not receive their wages on time increased month by month from January to May this year; in May alone, 57,683 people did not receive their wages.

### 生产降　出口减　失业增　物价涨  资本主义世界经济每况愈下

　　生产降　出口减　失业增　物价涨
    资本主义世界经济每况愈下
　　英国
    新华社29日讯据塔斯社伦敦28日讯：越来越多的迹象表明，英国经济情况正在日益恶化。
    这一点现在不仅有影响的报纸承认，就连身居高位的政治人物以及金融界和工业界的人士也不得不承认。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”认为，“有种种迹象表明，秋季将发生经济衰退，失业人数将增加”。
    据英国官方发表的数字，今年上半年的工业生产每月平均指数（以1948年为一百）比去年同期平均指数低两点。而今年6月的指数是一百三十四，比去年6月的指数下降了八点。
    生产衰退特别明显地表现在炼钢、纺织和煤炭等工业部门。据“经济学家”杂志统计，同去年7月相比较，今年7月份每周的钢产量减少13％，钢的出口量减少了将近四分之一。目前，英国炼钢企业的开工率只有80％。
    “金融时报”写道，纺织工业的生产衰退“非常尖锐”。根据贸易部机关杂志“贸易部周报”的统计，今年上半年，棉纺企业的产量减少了9％。今年头五个月毛织品产量比去年同期减少了14％。
    6月份英国矿井的采煤量比1957年的水平低7％。
    住宅建筑和工业建筑量也在不断减少。今年第一季度建造的住宅数比去年同一时期减少了15％。
    尽管英国政府尽了一切努力来扩大出口，但是英国出口总额（按价格计算）今年头七个月比去年同期仍然减少了4％。上半年向西欧国家的出口比去年降低了13.7％，甚至向英镑区国家的出口也减少了1.6％。
    资本家正在以解雇工人和压低实际工资的方式把生产衰退的后果转嫁到工人阶级身上。据财政部宣布，1958年1至6月国民经济部门的劳动人数减少了十六万五千人，其中有十五万二千人是加工工业的职工。今年7月英国的失业人数超过了四十五万人，创造了战后的最高纪录。英国工会领袖估计，明年1月份英国的失业工人有可能增加到七十五万。
    甚至官方的统计也承认，1958年由于物价上涨英国工人的实际工资正在减少。“金融时报”在评论中说，“一个工人即使能够保住自己在生产上的位置，他也会感到实际收入显然在减少。同时，在平均数字的后面，不熟练工人的（工资收入）情况正在空前地恶化。”
　　西德
    新华社29日讯据德意志通讯社报道：西德铁路管理局最近公布的材料表明，西德铁路的货运和客运在今年上半年都减少了。其中货运量比去年上半年减少了12.6％，客运量减少了14.4％。
    据说，铁路运输量减少是西德经济恶化的结果，特别是煤炭工业危机的结果。
    据西德报纸报道，由于运输量锐减，西德铁路管理局今年至少亏空十亿马克。现在，西德铁路管理局正在打算用解雇铁路员工的办法来弥补亏损。有消息说，它打算在第一批解雇的就有五千人。
　　阿根廷
    新华社讯　塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯26日电：阿根廷的物价继续飞涨。粮食和生活必需品的价格还在不断高涨。根据“什么”周刊的材料，仅在今年1月到7月这个时期内，粮食价格便涨了28.4％，衣服价格涨了17.5％，一般费用增加了26.6％。
　　日本
    新华社29日讯东京消息：随着经济危机的加深，日本的失业问题越来越严重。
    据日本总理府统计，今年1月到6月的完全失业人数每月平均保持在六十万人，比去年同一时期增加了一万七千人；6月一个月就比5月份增加了八万完全失业的人。
    据劳动省调查，今年上半年每月平均有六百七十家企业进行了“整理”（包括清理、歇业、倒闭），这个数字比去年同一时期增加了三点四七倍；每月平均有二万七千人受到“整理”（不同形式的解雇），这个数字比去年同一时期增加了三点三倍。
    日本官方的统计材料还表明，今年上半年，领取失业救济金的人数每月平均为四十七万一千人，比去年同一时期增加了47.7％。
    据日本报刊的材料，失业的情况将继续恶化。
    在煤矿业中，到今年年底将要有三万人被解雇或被停职；在钢铁企业中，到今年年底至少还有三千人要被解雇；在机器制造、化学、造纸、造船、纺织等企业中在今年下半年内都要继续解雇工人。
    最近一期“前卫”杂志指出，目前日本的实际失业人数相当于每两家就有一个完全失业者。
    经济危机同样使幸而免于被解雇的日本职工的生活更加困难。许多职工的工资遭到资方的扣发。据“日本经济新闻”报道，从今年1月到5月，不能按期领工资的人数月月在增加，只是5月一个月，就有五万七千六百八十三人没有领到工资。
