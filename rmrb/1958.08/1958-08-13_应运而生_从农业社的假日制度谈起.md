　　Emerging in Response to the Times
　　——Starting with the Holiday System of Agricultural Cooperatives

    The great leap forward in agricultural production has made rural life unprecedentedly active and bustling, but it has also brought some new problems, or new contradictions, to rural life. For example, labor is very intense, farmers do not have enough rest time, and they do not have much time to deal with private matters. What are people's views on these new problems or new contradictions? Some people were originally skeptical about the great leap forward in agricultural production, so when they saw the contradictions mentioned above, they were shocked and worried. However, in the eyes of the promoters, and in the eyes of the farmers themselves, as long as there is a great leap forward in production, everything will be easy to handle; there is no need to worry about the above contradictions at all, because after new contradictions arise, new ways to solve these contradictions will emerge in response to the times. Isn't this how new things in life are born?
    Like other regions, Chang'an County's farmland capital construction work has increased unprecedentedly this year, and the task of land processing is very heavy, making it a busy farming season all year round. It is under such circumstances that Chang'an County has universally implemented the "Grand Weekend Public Rest System," allowing members to have a day off every half month. On public holidays, cultural and recreational activities such as dramas, songs, dances, and ball games are generally active in the countryside, and patriotic health campaigns are also carried out. Members also have time to deal with private matters.
    With two fewer working days per month in agricultural cooperatives, will collective production be affected? Chang'an County's experience shows that the public holiday system not only did not hinder production but also promoted it. For example, after the Taiping River Agricultural Cooperative implemented the public holiday system, the attendance rate increased from 85% in the past to over 97%.
    Under the system of public ownership of the means of production, the contradictions between the individual and the collective can be correctly resolved based on the principle of combining collective interests and individual interests. Rapidly developing agricultural production is the fundamental interest of all farmers. In order to develop production at high speed, it is now necessary to work hard, carry out certain shock tasks, and engage in arduous battles. However, in order to protect the enthusiasm and health of the masses, it is also necessary to appropriately adjust the relationship between production and life, work and rest, hard work and recuperation, shock work and non-shock work. In this way, not only can production be carried out rhythmically, but also the enthusiasm and dedication of the masses can be more powerfully stimulated, allowing production to develop from one upsurge to another.
    The emergence of the holiday system and many other new things tells people that they should look at the so-called "tension" problem in rural areas from a correct perspective. The skeptics of the great leap forward in agricultural production think that the countryside is "too tense!" However, the farmers "would rather work hard than suffer bitterly!" Because farmers have suffered enough from natural disasters and poverty for many years, they want to "work hard for three years and be happy for ten thousand years." Farmers who have become the true masters of the land and are full of pride and hope are not only brave enough to work hard but also increasingly good at arranging their lives in the midst of intense hard work. When they lack rest and time to deal with family affairs, they come up with the idea of implementing a holiday system. Not only that, but they have also created many new things aimed at enriching material and spiritual life in the process of hard work. Countless counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives have established colleges, middle schools, and cultural stations; many places have farmers running their own drama troupes and writing their own scripts; some agricultural cooperatives have set up their own film projection teams; many agricultural cooperatives have established hospitals and maternity hospitals; farmer-built parks have appeared in the mountainous areas of Xianning County in Hubei and Xichong County in Sichuan; agricultural cooperatives in the western suburbs of Tianjin have built their own waterworks (so that members no longer have to drink the smelly and dirty sewage from the river)... In many rural areas, one can see new slogans such as "Exercise and Live a Long and Healthy Life," and one can hear songs, music, and the sound of reading. Aren't all these beautiful new things sprouting like bamboo shoots after a spring rain during a period of intense hard work? Shouldn't the "rural tension theorists" be awakened in the face of so many new things?

　　应运而生
　　——从农业社的假日制度谈起
　　程浦
    农业生产大跃进使农村生活空前活跃和沸腾起来，但也附带给农村生活带来了一些新问题，或者说新矛盾。如劳动十分紧张，农民休息时间不足，没有多少时间处理私人事情等。人们对于这些新问题或新矛盾抱着怎样的看法呢？有些人对于农业生产大跃进原本就是怀疑的，所以一看到上面所说的那些矛盾，就大惊小怪，忧虑重重。可是，在促进派看来，在农民自己看来，只要生产大跃进，什么事情都好办；上面那些矛盾根本用不着发愁，因为在新矛盾产生之后，解决这种矛盾的新办法也会应运而生。生活中的新事物难道不就是这样诞生的吗？
    和其他地区一样，长安县今年的农田基本建设工作空前增加，土地加工的任务十分繁重，一年到头都是农忙。长安县就是在这样的情况下普遍实行了“大礼拜公休制度”，使社员每半月有一个休假日。在公休日，农村里戏剧、歌舞、球赛等文化娱乐活动普遍活跃起来，爱国卫生运动也开展起来，社员也有时间处理私人事情了。
    一月之中农业社少了两个工作日，集体生产不会受到影响吗？长安县的经验说明：公休日制度不但没有妨碍生产，而且促进了生产。如太平河农业社实行公休日制以后，出勤率由过去的85％提高到97％以上。
    在生产资料公有制下，个人和集体之间的矛盾，是可以根据集体利益和个人利益相结合的原则加以正确解决的。高速度地发展农业生产，是全体农民的根本利益。为了高速度地发展生产，现在必须紧张地劳动，必须进行一定的突击工作，必须苦战。但是，为了保护群众的劳动热情和健康，同时也需要适当地调节生产和生活、劳动和休息、苦战和休整、突击和非突击之间的关系，这样，不但可以使生产有节奏地进行，也可以更有力地激励群众的干劲和钻劲，使生产一个高潮接着一个高潮向前发展。
    休假日制度和其他许多新事物的出现，都告诉人们，应该用正确的观点去看所谓农村“紧张”的问题。农业生产大跃进的怀疑派以为农村“太紧张了！”可是，农民却“宁愿苦战，不愿苦熬！”因为农民多少年来受自然灾害和贫困之苦已经受够了，所以他们要“苦战三年，幸福万年”。做了土地的真正主人、充满了自豪感和希望的农民，不但勇于苦战，而且也越来越善于在紧张的苦战中安排自己的生活。缺少休息和处理家事的时间，他们就想出了实行休假日制度的办法。不但如此，他们还在苦战的过程中创造了许多旨在丰富物质生活和精神生活的新事物。无数的县、乡和农业社办了大专学校、中学以及文化站；许多地方农民自办剧团，自写剧本；有的农业社自设电影放映队；许多农业社创办了医院和产院；湖北咸宁县和四川西充县的山区出现了农民自建的公园；天津市西郊的农业社自己建造了自来水厂（社员们可以不再吃河里的又臭又脏的污水了）……在许多农村里可以看到“锻炼身体，人寿年丰”的新标语，可以听到歌声、琴声、读书声。这一切美好的新事物，难道不都是紧张的苦战期间像雨后春笋般地萌发出来的吗？“农村紧张论者”站在这么多的新事物面前，难道不应该有所醒悟吗？
