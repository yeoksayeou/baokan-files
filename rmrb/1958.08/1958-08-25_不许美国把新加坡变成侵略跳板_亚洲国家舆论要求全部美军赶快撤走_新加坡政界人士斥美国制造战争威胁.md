Singapore
Xinhua News Agency, 24th August: Singaporean sources report that Singaporean political figures voiced their opposition on the 22nd to the arrival of U.S. warships and Marines in Singapore. They believe that the presence of U.S. troops is detrimental to the people of Singapore.

Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General of the People's Action Party, stated that the U.S.'s conspiracy to organize the Indian Ocean Fleet deployment has already caused strong protests in Southeast Asia, and Singapore should never become a base for the U.S. Navy to brandish its saber.

David Marshall, Chairman of the Workers' Party, said that the U.S. presence in Singapore will bring the harmful effects of imperialism, power politics, and war, which runs counter to the interests of the Singaporean people. He said that Singapore's welfare lies in maintaining its status as a free port, and it should not be threatened by war.

Several members of the Singapore Legislative Assembly have decided to question the Chief Minister of Singapore about this matter.

Comprehensive report from this newspaper, Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in Asian countries continues to criticize the provocative action of U.S. troops landing in Singapore.
　　
Korea
"Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 24th, saying that the landing of U.S. troops in Singapore is another provocative act attempting to undermine peace in Asia, and this action by the U.S. has aroused the anger of the Asian people. The commentary demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from Singapore.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. is dispatching troops to land in Singapore in order to intensify the "Cold War" in the Southeast Asian region and to suppress the national liberation movements of the people in this region by force. This provocative act by the U.S. is an intolerable threat to the territory and sovereignty of Southeast Asian countries.

India
U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's explanation that the purpose of the U.S. Marine Corps landing in Singapore was for "rest and recreation" has further angered Indian newspapers, which have accused the U.S. of interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries.

"The Free Press Journal" published an editorial on the 22nd, saying that Eisenhower's explanation was "nonsense" and neither convincing nor "helpful in clearing up the doubts that exist in many Asian capitals." The newspaper pointed out, "The journey from Okinawa to Singapore for that kind of rest and recreation is too long, unless it is a very special kind of rest and recreation!"

The "Leader" of Allahabad also pointed out that the U.S. sent its warships to Singapore to implement Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick" policy. But Eisenhower forgot that it is now 1958, not 1903. It protested Washington's claim that the U.S. Navy would help "friendly countries" in the Indian Ocean. The newspaper said: "The situation in Southeast Asia is a matter for the people of this region, not for the United States."

Indonesia
The National Committee of the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union pointed out on the 23rd that U.S. troops must be urged to withdraw from Singapore because these U.S. troops directly threaten the security of Indonesia.

In a letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio, the National Committee of the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union wrote that Indonesian workers are paying attention to the news of the landing of U.S. troops in Singapore with concern and unease. The letter pointed out that the U.S. took this action to provide spiritual support to the Indonesian rebel groups facing collapse. At the same time, the purpose of this move is also to intimidate the Indonesian government and people when the captured U.S. pilot, Pope, is about to be tried.

The All-Indonesia Central Labor Union requested the government to take measures to ensure that the U.S. troops in Singapore withdraw as soon as possible.

The Indonesian newspaper "Sin Po" demanded on the 23rd that the Indonesian government take concrete steps to demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Singapore. The newspaper said that the Indonesian rebels who had received U.S. aid have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, the presence of U.S. troops in Singapore makes Indonesia feel uneasy.

The newspaper pointed out that this also makes people suspect whether the subversive activities currently being carried out in Sumatran airspace are based in Singapore, where the U.S. Seventh Fleet is stationed.

Burma
The Burmese newspaper "Kyemon" published a commentary on the 22nd, saying that the U.S. stationing of its navy in Singapore is the first step in establishing a new military base in Southeast Asia, and this is another step by the U.S. for expansion and aggression in this region.

Reviewing the U.S.'s acts of aggression, "Kyemon" said: "Wherever the U.S. Navy goes, they have never done any good for any place. This can be clearly seen in the Mediterranean today, where the U.S. Sixth Fleet is setting fire to Lebanon. The U.S. Seventh Fleet has also invaded Taiwan under the guise of aiding the Kuomintang and is threatening mainland China."

　　不许美国把新加坡变成侵略跳板
    亚洲国家舆论要求全部美军赶快撤走
    新加坡政界人士斥美国制造战争威胁
　　新加坡
    新华社24日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡政界人士22日发表谈话，反对美国军舰和海军陆战队开到新加坡。他们认为，美军的驻扎对新加坡人民是不利的。
    人民行动党总书记李光耀说，美国阴谋组织印度洋舰队的部署已在东南亚方面引起强烈的抗议，新加坡绝不应成为美国海军挥舞军刀的基地。
    工人党主席马歇尔说，美国驻扎在新加坡将带来帝国主义、强权政治和战争的有害影响，这是同新加坡人民的利益背道而驰的。他说，新加坡的福利是维持作为一个自由港的地位，它不应受到战争的威胁。
    新加坡立法议会的好些个议员已经决定就这件事向新加坡首席部长提出质询。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：亚洲各国舆论继续抨击美军登陆新加坡的挑衅行动。
　　朝鲜
    “劳动新闻”24日发表评论说，美军在新加坡登陆是企图破坏亚洲和平的又一个挑衅行为，美国的这一行动引起了亚洲人民的愤怒。评论要求美军立即从新加坡撤退。
    评论指出，美国派遣军队在新加坡登陆，是为了在东南亚地区加紧进行“冷战”，用武力镇压这个地区人民的民族解放运动。美国的这种挑衅行为是对东南亚地区国家的领土和主权的不能令人容忍的威胁。
　　印度
    美国总统艾森豪威尔把美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆的目的说成是“休息和娱乐”，这使印度报纸更加感到愤慨，它们纷纷指责美国的行动是在干涉东南亚国家的内政。
    “自由新闻”22日发表社论说，艾森豪威尔的解释是“胡说八道”，既不能令人信服，也“无助于扫清在许多亚洲国家的首都中存在着的疑问。”这家报纸指出，“从冲绳岛到新加坡来进行那种休息和娱乐，路程是太长了，除非这是非常特别的一种休息和娱乐！”
    阿拉哈巴德的“领袖报”也指出，美国派遣它的军舰到新加坡去执行西奥多·罗斯福的“大棒政策”。但是艾森豪威尔忘记现在是1958年而不是1903年。它对华盛顿所谓美国海军将帮助印度洋的“友好国家”的说法表示抗议。这家报纸说：“东南亚的局势是这个地区人民的事情，而不是美国的事情。”
　　印度尼西亚
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国委员会23日指出，必须促使美国军队撤出新加坡，因为这些美国军队直接地威胁了印度尼西亚的安全。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国委员会在致外交部长苏班德里约的一封信中写道，印度尼西亚的工人们正以忧虑和不安的心情注意着美国军队在新加坡登陆的消息。这封信指出，美国采取这种行动是为了给予面临崩溃的印度尼西亚叛乱集团以精神上的支持。同时，这样作的目的也是为了在被捕的美国飞行员波普将要受审的时候，对印度尼西亚政府和人民进行恫吓。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会要求政府采取措施使得美国在新加坡的军队尽快撤退。
    印度尼西亚文报纸“新报”23日要求印度尼西亚政府采取具体步骤要求美国军队立即全部撤出新加坡。这家报纸说，曾经得到美国援助的印度尼西亚叛乱分子还没有全部消灭，因此，美国军队驻在新加坡使得印度尼西亚感到不安。
    这家报纸指出，这也使得人们怀疑目前在苏门答腊领空进行的颠复活动是不是以驻有美国第七舰队的舰只的新加坡作为基地的。
　　缅甸
    缅甸文报纸“镜报”22日发表评论说，美国在新加坡驻扎海军，是它在东南亚建立新的军事基地的第一个步骤，这是美国为了在这一地区进行扩张和侵略的又一步骤。
    “镜报”在回顾美国的侵略行动时说：“不管美国海军开到那里，他们从来没有对任何地方干过任何好事。今天在地中海就能够清楚地看到这一点，美国第六舰队正在黎巴嫩放火。美国第七舰队也在援助国民党的幌子下侵入了台湾，而且威胁着中国大陆”。
