After the opening ceremony, a radio-controlled model performance was held first. When cruisers, torpedo boats, battleships and other models were launched, they automatically left the dock and sailed according to the prescribed route. During the voyage, they also automatically made various interesting actions such as whistles, signaling, smoke, and launching rockets; sometimes they also made wonderful performances such as forward, backward, and turning left and right.

Today, competitions were also held for 5 cubic centimeter internal combustion engine powered speed models, 2.5 cubic centimeter internal combustion engine powered speed models, and steam powered warship models. (Attached pictures)

    据新华社15日讯　中国人民国防体育协会主办的第一届全国航海模型竞赛，今天开始在北京龙潭湖举行。参加这次竞赛的旅大、青岛、广州、上海等二十一个城市的代表队，带来了他们自己制造的外观、航行和竞速比赛的各种模型二百四十七个，其中有战列舰、雷击舰、扫雷舰、猎潜舰、航空舰等；此外还有无线电操纵的航行表演模型八个。
    这次比赛项目有橡筋动力舰艇模型、橡筋商船模型、电动舰艇模型、电动商船模型、蒸气动力舰艇模型、二·五立方公分以下内燃机动力竞速模型、五立方公分以下内燃机动力竞速模型和帆船模型等。
    开幕式后，首先举行了无线电操纵模型表演。当一艘艘巡洋舰、雷击舰、战列舰等模型分别下水后，自动地离开了码头，按照规定航线航行，并且在航行过程中还自动地作出了各种鸣笛、打信号、放烟雾、发射火箭等饶有趣味的动作；有时它们还作着前进、后退和左右拐弯等精采的表演。
    今天，还举行了五立方公分内燃机动力竞速模型、二·五立方公分内燃机动力竞速模型和蒸气动力舰艇模型的比赛。（附图片）
