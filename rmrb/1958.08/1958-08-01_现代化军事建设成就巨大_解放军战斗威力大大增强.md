Xinhua News Agency, 31st - The People's Liberation Army's various services and units have made tremendous achievements in modern military construction, and their combat power to defend the motherland and safeguard peace has been greatly enhanced.

    Since the beginning of this year, inspired by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the modernization construction and military training of the PLA's various services and arms have also seen a vigorous Great Leap Forward. Based on inheriting the glorious traditions of the past and fully utilizing the rich combat experience of our army, training targets have been broken again and again, and the combat capabilities of carrying out modern combined arms coordinated operations have also been greatly improved. The Air Force not only possesses various excellent flight equipment, but also possesses a powerful flight force with highly skilled flight skills, sufficient to reliably defend the airspace of the motherland. The glorious "war eagles" of the motherland, with the heroic spirit of "clearing the clouds and mist to pluck the stars," have increasingly reached the "all-weather" flight level, capable of conducting long-distance flight operations under any complex weather conditions and annihilating any enemy who dares to intrude into the airspace of the motherland. The Navy not only has a very strong combat fleet and naval air force, which can ensure that the motherland's long and vast territorial waters are not violated together with the coastal artillery force, but is also rapidly mastering the ability to conduct maritime operations under all complex conditions with the fearless spirit of "trampling the ten thousand acres of waves of the East (South) Sea." As for the always brave and invincible powerful army, in addition to having a large number of artillery, armored forces, and many other new services suitable for the needs of modern warfare, the combat skills in modern warfare have also been greatly improved.
    This people's army, which has been under the absolute leadership of the Party since the first day of its birth, has a high degree of political consciousness and a determination and will to be loyal to the motherland and loyal to peace. In mastering modern military technology and learning modern warfare skills, they are as fierce as tigers descending the mountain, making rapid progress. As a result of the hard work of the vast number of officers and soldiers, the speed of improvement in technical level can no longer be calculated in "years" or "quarters," but needs to be calculated in days and hours. Naval soldiers are not only proficient in their professional skills, but also a large number of "all-round sailors" have emerged. In a naval gunnery exercise, non-specialist gunners from departments such as the engine room achieved a hit rate of 80% to 90%. Under the determination of "mastering all eighteen martial arts and having the ability to fight battles," they repaired ships themselves and created the new achievement of "small and medium repairs of warships not entering the factory." The speed of improvement in the combat quality of artillery, armored forces, and infantry is also astonishing. A large number of "all-round gunners," "all-round gunner regiments," and "all-round gunner divisions" have emerged. Many gunners have quickly become all-rounders in commanding shooting and driving vehicles, and a large number of infantry soldiers have become "all-round marksmen," able to use rifles, machine guns, and several other firearms, and still able to hit the target with every shot in live ammunition shooting.
    At present, the vast number of commanders and fighters of this powerful people's army are closely watching the situation in the Middle East and the southeast coast with a high degree of vigilance, preparing to give a devastating blow to the aggressors who dare to expand aggression and threaten world peace, and are ready to liberate Taiwan at any time.

    现代化军事建设成就巨大
    解放军战斗威力大大增强
    新华社31日讯　中国人民解放军各军种、各部队现代化军事建设取得巨大成就，保卫祖国、保卫和平的战斗威力有了极大的增强。
    今年以来，在全民大跃进的形势鼓舞下，人民解放军各军种部队的现代化建设和军事训练工作也都相继出现了轰轰烈烈大跃进的局面。在继承过去光荣传统和充分运用我军丰富战斗经验的基础上，训练指标一破再破，进行现代化诸兵种合成军队协同作战的战斗能力，也都有了很大的提高。空军部队不仅拥有各种优良的飞行装备，而且拥有足以可靠地捍卫祖国领空安全的、具有高度飞行技能的强大的飞行部队。光荣的祖国“战鹰”们，以“拨开云雾摘星星”的英雄气概，越来越多地达到了“全天候”的飞行水平，能够在任何复杂的气象条件下进行长距离的飞行作战，歼灭任何胆敢窜入祖国领空的敌人。海军部队不仅拥有战斗力很强的舰艇部队和海军航空兵部队，能够和海岸炮兵部队一起确保祖国漫长而广阔的领海不受侵犯，而且正以“踏平东（南）海万顷浪”的无畏精神，迅速掌握着在一切复杂条件下进行海上作战的本领。至于向来英勇无敌的强大的陆军，除了有数量众多的炮兵、装甲兵和其它许多适应现代战争需要的新兵种以外，现代化战争中的作战本领也大大提高了。
    这支从诞生的第一天起就在党的绝对领导下的人民军队，每一个指挥员、战斗员都有着高度的政治觉悟，有着忠于祖国忠于和平的决心和意志，他们在掌握现代化军事技术，学习现代化战争作战本领方面，如猛虎下山，突飞猛进。广大官兵刻苦钻研的结果，技术水平提高的速度，已经不能用“年度”、“季度”计算，而需要按日、按时来计算了。海军战士不仅个个精通自己的专业技术，而且出现了大批的“全能水兵”。某军舰在一次海上射击演习中，轮机等部门的非专职炮手，射击的命中率达到80％到90％。他们在“十八般武艺皆精通，打起仗来有本领”的决心下，自己动手修理舰艇，创造了“军舰小修、中修不进厂”的新成就。炮兵、装甲兵和步兵战斗素质提高的速度也异常惊人。“全能炮手”、“全能炮手团”、“全能炮手师”大批涌现出来。许多炮手都迅速成了指挥射击、驾驶车辆的全才，大批步兵战士成了“全能枪手”，能使用步枪和机关枪等好几种火器，在实弹射击中还能百发百中。
    当前，这支具有强大威力的人民军队的广大指战员正以高度的警惕，密切注视着中东地区和东南沿海地区的形势，准备随时给敢于扩大侵略、威胁世界和平的侵略者以毁灭性的打击，随时准备解放台湾。
