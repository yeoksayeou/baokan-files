Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 15th: The Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party today issued a message celebrating Indonesia's National Day, stating that the task of the Indonesian nation in the coming year will be to continue opposing foreign interference, especially American interference.

The message, when discussing the tasks of the Indonesian nation, also pointed out the need to continue destroying the Indonesian rebel groups and the "Darul Islam" terrorist groups that constitute the foundation of imperialist interference; to continue and more resolutely eliminate Dutch economic power in Indonesia, first by making the greatest efforts to transform the Dutch large enterprises that have already been taken over into state property; to oppose the economic domination of other imperialists; to expand the democratic rights of the people; to oppose delaying the general election; to raise the living standards of the people; and to drive the Dutch colonialists out of West Irian.

The Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party pointed out in the message that the Indonesian people have achieved accomplishments in the past year in taking over Dutch enterprises, opposing the interference of the United States and other imperialists, and basically destroying rebel groups. The message strongly condemned the interference and aggression carried out by the United States against Indonesia in the past year. The message pointed out that thanks to the opposition of the Juanda government, the Indonesian armed forces, and the entire Indonesian people, and thanks to the active support of the socialist camp countries and Asian and African countries for the Indonesian people, the aggression and interference of the United States was thwarted.

The message further revealed that the new conspiracy of the United States is to attempt to collude with domestic Indonesian reactionaries, to drag those who take a middle-of-the-road stance to their side, to restore anti-communist propaganda, and to realize the conspiracies that the rebel groups could not achieve through such means.

　　印度尼西亚共产党发表国庆文告
　　号召继续反对帝国主义干涉
    据新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚共产党政治局今天发表一项庆祝印度尼西亚国庆的文告说，印度尼西亚民族来年的任务将是继续反对外国干涉，特别是反对美国的干涉。
    文告在谈到印度尼西亚民族的任务时还指出，需要继续摧毁那些构成帝国主义干涉的基础的印度尼西亚叛乱集团和“伊斯兰教军”恐怖集团；继续和更加坚决地消灭荷兰在印度尼西亚的经济势力，首先是作出最大的努力把已经接管的荷兰大企业变为国家的财产；反对其它帝国主义者的经济统治；扩大人民的民主权利；反对拖延大选；提高人民的生活水平，把荷兰殖民主义者赶出西伊里安。
    印度尼西亚共产党政治局在文告中指出，印度尼西亚人民在过去的一年中，在接管荷兰的企业、反对美国和其它帝国主义者的干涉和基本上摧毁叛乱集团等方面取得了成就。文告强烈谴责美国在过去一年中对印度尼西亚所进行的干涉和侵略。文告指出，由于朱安达政府、印度尼西亚武装部队和全体印度尼西亚人民的反对，由于社会主义阵营各国和亚非国家对印度尼西亚人民的积极支持，美国的侵略和干涉被挫败了。
    文告进一步揭露：美国的新阴谋是企图勾结印度尼西亚国内反动分子，把走中间路线的人拖到他们那一边，来恢复反共宣传，并且通过这样的办法来实现叛乱集团所不能实现的阴谋。
