(Xinhua News Agency) Protest movements against the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East are unfolding widely in various Latin American countries.

The Argentine Peace Committee issued a statement on the 12th, demanding that the US and Britain cease their aggression against the Near and Middle East and withdraw their occupying forces from Lebanon and Jordan.

The Argentine Peace Committee condemned US-British interference in the affairs of other countries. It demanded that the Argentine government immediately call on the United Nations for the US and Britain to cease their aggression and withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The statement expressed that Argentina's representative to the United Nations should support the convening of a summit conference of the heads of government of major powers to discuss international issues and ease international tensions.

According to a recent report in the Argentine "Times," various Argentine social groups have issued statements and declarations, and held mass rallies and demonstrations against the US-British aggression against Arab countries.

The Argentine Women's Union held a rally of three thousand people in San Martin Square in Mar del Plata to protest the US-British aggression against the Middle East. A large-scale demonstration was also held after the meeting. Members of the Argentine Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and the ruling "Intransigent Radical Civic Union" participated in the march.

The San Martin City Peace Committee organized a march with the participation of city councilors and union representatives. The mayor also participated in the march.

The Villa Palle Housing Welfare Committee and the Bajo Belgrano Women's Union branch jointly issued a bulletin, warning residents, especially mothers, to be wary of the imperialists' conspiracies to launch coups and aggression against the people of all countries.

Residents of Junin City also held a large march of 1,400 people, expressing deep sympathy and support for the people of the Middle East.

The "Ultima Hora" reported that the people of Peru held a mass rally in Lima, the capital of Peru, to protest the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.

Police attacked those who participated in the rally, injuring some of them. The police also made arrests.

Mexican newspapers criticized the United States and Britain for their armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and expressed the Latin American people's sympathy for the national liberation movement of the Arab countries against imperialism.

An editorial in "El Día," an influential Mexican publication, emphasized that Arab countries hope to achieve political and economic independence.

Another influential Mexican magazine, "Siempre," published an article by Vicente Lombardo Toledano, president of the Mexican People's Party. The article stated that the US armed invasion of Lebanon was a typical act of piracy, aimed at preventing the people of underdeveloped countries from deciding their own destiny according to their needs and desires. This is reminiscent of the situation in 1914 when the United States invaded the city of Veracruz in Mexico under the pretext that our country's revolution caused damage to American interests.

According to Chilean newspapers, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Chilean Socialist Party closed in Santiago. The plenary session condemned the US-British aggression against the Near East and emphasized the great significance of mutual understanding between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

The General Secretary of the Chilean Socialist Party, Corvalán, delivered a report at the plenary session, and the participants of the plenary session adopted a resolution condemning the US-British armed intervention in the Near East. The resolution stated, "The United States' criminal aggression against Lebanon is a serious violation of the United Nations Charter."

　　反对美英侵略阿拉伯国家
　　拉丁美洲抗议运动高涨
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：抗议美英武装干涉中东的运动，正在拉丁美洲各国广泛展开。
    阿根廷和平委员会12日发表声明，要求停止美英对中近东的侵略和把占领军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    阿根廷和平委员会谴责美英干涉其他国家的事务，它要求阿根廷政府立即在联合国里要求美英停止侵略，并且把它们的军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出去。
    声明表示阿根廷驻联合国的代表应当赞成召开大国政府首脑会议来讨论国际问题和缓和国际紧张局势。
    据阿根廷“时报”不久以前报道，阿根廷各社会团体纷纷发表声明和宣言，并且举行群众集会和示威游行，反对美英侵略阿拉伯国家。
    阿根廷妇女联合会在马德普拉塔的圣马丁广场举行了三千人的大会，抗议美英侵略中东。会后还举行了声势浩大的示威游行。阿根廷共产党、共产主义青年联盟和执政党“不妥协激进公民联盟”的成员都参加了这次游行。
    圣马丁市的和平委员会组织了一次有市议员和工会代表参加的游行。市长也参加了这次游行。
    维利亚帕雷市房屋福利委员会和巴霍贝尔格拉诺妇女联合会分会联合发表公报，警告居民，特别是母亲们，要提防帝国主义发动政变和侵略各国人民的阴谋。
    胡宁城的居民也举行了一次一千四百人的大游行，对中东人民表示深切的同情和支持。
      “最后一点钟报”报道，秘鲁人民在秘鲁的首都利马举行了抗议美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的群众大会。
    警察袭击参加大会的人，使他们当中有一些人受了伤。警察还进行了逮捕。

    据智利报刊报道，智利社会党中央全会在圣地亚哥闭幕。全会斥责美英侵略近东，并强调社会党和共产党相互了解具有重大意义。
