Taking American Money and Obeying American Orders
Chamoun is Preparing to Organize a New Political Party
Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 25th. The "Al Alam" newspaper here, citing news from Lebanon, revealed that the United States has already allocated $25 million to Chamoun for him to organize a new political party in Lebanon. This new party will recruit members from Lebanon's fascist parties—the National Socialist Party and the Phalange Party.
The news also pointed out that Chamoun's new party will be used to counter Lebanese Arab nationalism and strengthen Western influence in Lebanon.
Chamoun, the imperialist agent spurned by the Lebanese people, recently openly stated that after stepping down as "President" at the end of September, he "has no intention of retiring from political life" and will organize a political party to "continue to strive for the implementation of pro-Western policies."

　　拿美国的钱  听美国使唤
    夏蒙正在筹组新政党
    新华社大马士革25日电　此间“旗帜报”援引黎巴嫩方面的消息揭露，美国已经拨给夏蒙二千五百万美元，供他在黎巴嫩组织新政党之用。这个新党将网罗黎巴嫩的法西斯政党——国家社会党和长枪党的党徒参加。
    这个消息还指出，夏蒙的这个新党将用来对付黎巴嫩的阿拉伯民族主义和加强西方在黎巴嫩的势力。
    受到黎巴嫩人民唾弃的帝国主义代理人夏蒙，在不久前曾经公开表示，他在9月底卸任“总统”职务以后“无意脱离政治生活”，并且要组织一个政党来“继续为争取执行亲西方政策而斗争”。
