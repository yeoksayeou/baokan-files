Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Since Peking University launched a mass movement for a great leap forward in scientific research at the beginning of August, the university has completed more than 360 scientific research projects in just half a month, of which more than 30 have reached or surpassed international levels. On the evening of the 15th and the afternoon of the 16th, the school held science and liberal arts language department scientific leap forward comparison meetings respectively.

　　In the movement, the science departments took the advanced as the guide for the general, used indigenous methods to tackle advanced technology, closely integrated with reality and production, and achieved great results. The semiconductor specialization of the Physics Department successfully trial-produced 14 types of semiconductor diodes that can be used in electronic computers, radars, and cyclotrons. The world's most precise and fastest semiconductor photography technology—semiconductor electronic photography and rapid printing—was also successfully researched by this department. Using this method of photography, not only can photos be taken in one second, but the photos can also be printed out. This research success is of great value to medicine, national defense, and the technological revolution in printing. Many of the projects in this research directly address practical problems in production. For example, according to the requirements of the geological department, the rapid analysis of calcium and magnesium in iron ore by the Chemistry Department reduced the analysis process from more than one or two days in the past to three hours, which is of great significance for geological exploration and industrial production. The four kinds of spectrally pure chemical reagents they made according to the requirements of the chemical industry department are all new products in our country.

　　The liberal arts language departments, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, studied teaching materials, studied some issues in socialist construction, and criticized bourgeois academic thought, also achieving great results. They wrote many articles criticizing bourgeois academic thought and modern revisionism, and compiled some books. The students of the Philosophy Department wrote 13 papers, boldly criticizing Professor Feng Youlan's "New Theory of Things" written during the Anti-Japanese War, exposing its bourgeois idealist essence. Guided by Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, economics students wrote four papers criticizing Ma Yinchu's economic thoughts. The Korean language major of the Department of Oriental Languages compiled a Chinese-Korean dictionary containing 100,000 words, which contains a large number of new words from Chairman Mao's works and People's Daily editorials. Students also participated in the compilation of many teaching syllabuses and lecture notes.

　　This movement involved students, young teachers, and veteran professors working together, and broke with past conventions, with students and young teachers becoming the main force in scientific research. The movement enriched the students' practical knowledge and trained their practical working abilities. Many veteran professors were deeply moved and educated in this movement, and realized the correctness of the mass line in scientific work.

　　At the comparison meeting, through evaluating politics in command, evaluating the mass line, evaluating ideological liberation, and evaluating achievements, experiences were exchanged, and achievements were reviewed, so that teachers and students more clearly realized that scientific research work should not only mobilize the masses to do it, but also can be done through movement, and can also be done in a faster, better, and more economical way. This comparison summarized the first stage of the movement, and the movement is still developing and deepening.

　　用群众运动方法搞科学研究
　　北京大学举行理科文科跃进评比大会
    据新华社17日讯　北京大学从8月初开展科学研究大跃进的群众性运动以来，在短短的半个月内，全校已经完成三百六十多个科学研究项目，其中有三十多项达到或超过了国际水平。15日晚和16日下午，这个学校分别举行了理科和文科语言各系科学跃进评比大会。
    理科各系在运动中以尖端带一般，土法搞尖端，密切联系实际和联系生产，取得了很大的成绩。物理系半导体专门化试制成功了可用于电子计算机、雷达、回旋加速器的十四种半导体二极管。世界上最精密的、也是最快的半导体照相术——半导体电子照相和快速印刷，这个系也研究成功了。用这种方法照相，在一秒钟内不但可以照好，而且连照片也都可印出来，这一研究成功对医学上、国防上和印刷术的技术革命都具有很重要的价值。在这次研究的项目中，有许多都是在直接解决生产实践中的问题。如化学系根据地质部门的要求，研究铁矿中钙、镁的快速分析的结果，分析过程从过去需要一天多至二天的时间缩短为三小时，这对地质勘探和工业生产都有很大的意义。他们根据化工部门要求制成的四种光谱纯化学试剂，都是我国的新产品。
    文科语言各系以毛泽东思想为纲，研究教材、研究社会主义建设中的一些问题和批判资产阶级的学术思想，也取得了很大成绩。他们写了不少批判资产阶级学术思想和现代修正主义的文章，编写了一些书。哲学系的学生们写了十三篇论文，大胆地批判了冯友兰教授在抗战时期所写的“新事论”，揭露了其资产阶级唯心主义的本质。经济系学生以毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和刘少奇同志在中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议上的报告为指导思想，写了四篇批判马寅初经济学思想的论文。东语系朝鲜语专业编出了一本包有十万个词的汉朝词典，里面有大量的毛主席著作和人民日报社论中的新词汇。学生们还参加编写了许多教学大纲和讲义。
    这次运动是学生、青年教师和老教授一齐动手，并且打破了过去的常规，学生和青年教师成了科学研究的主力。运动丰富了学生们的实际知识，和锻炼了学生们的实际工作能力。不少老教授在这次运动中深受感动和教育，认识到了科学工作中走群众路线的方针的正确。
    在评比大会上，通过评政治挂帅、评群众路线、评思想解放、评成果，互相交流经验，检阅成绩，使师生们更清楚地认识到科学研究工作不但要发动群众来搞，而且可以通过运动来搞，也可以多快好省。这次评比总结了运动的第一阶段情况，运动还在继续发展和深入。
