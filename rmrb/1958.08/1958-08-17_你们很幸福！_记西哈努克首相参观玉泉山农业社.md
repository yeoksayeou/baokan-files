　　"You are very happy!"
　　——A Record of Prime Minister Sihanouk's Visit to the Yuquanshan Agricultural Cooperative

　　"You are very happy!" This is what Prime Minister Sihanouk admiringly said to the members of the Yuquanshan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing when he visited on the afternoon of the 16th. This sentence expresses the Prime Minister's deep impression of his visit to the cooperative.

　　Accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long, all the distinguished Cambodian guests visited the cooperative's own factories, high-yield rice fields, and canteen, and visited peasant families. Prime Minister Sihanouk was so attentive and enthusiastic, constantly asking questions of the members and sharing his good impressions with the other distinguished Cambodian guests.

　　When the distinguished guests arrived at the cooperative, they were warmly welcomed by the members. Among the welcoming crowd, Prime Minister Sihanouk met a sixteen-year-old female student named Wang Yuqin, who was studying at an agricultural school in the southern suburbs of Beijing and had returned home for vacation today.

　　"After you graduate, do you plan to be a farmer or a cadre?" the Prime Minister asked the female student.

　　"A farmer. My aspiration is to engage in agriculture," Wang Yuqin told the Prime Minister.

　　"Will you return to the village after graduation?" the Prime Minister asked again.

　　"I will completely obey the organization's assignment."

　　"Have you farmed before?"

　　"No. I learned farming at school, and labor has changed my thinking." The Prime Minister was very satisfied with Wang Yuqin's simple answer and wished her well in realizing her beautiful aspirations.

　　The Prime Minister also met a group of cadres who had been sent down to the cooperative for labor training. Upon closer questioning, the Prime Minister discovered that they were the faculty and staff members of the Central Institute for Nationalities, which he had visited during his visit to China in 1956.

　　"How long have you been down here?" the Prime Minister asked these cadres who had been sent down.

　　"It's been half a year."

　　"How many people are there?"

　　"Forty-one."

　　The Prime Minister carefully examined their tanned faces and their farmer-like attire, and then praised, "Your working and living with the people is an example for us to learn from. We admire you very much." The Prime Minister then asked, "What kind of labor do you do?" These new farmers replied: Working with the members in the fields and running small factories.

　　So, Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai, etc., were led by these new farmers to visit their own factories.

　　In a small room, piles of bottled tomato sauce were stacked high. The new farmers told the distinguished guests that this was produced by their self-run tomato processing factory. Three catties of tomatoes can make one bottle, and the product is fully qualified after inspection. Each bottle sells for nine jiao on the market, but they plan to sell it for only five jiao. The cadres sent down told the Prime Minister that they were not doing it to make money, but mainly because this year's tomato harvest was abundant, and they were processing them to solve the storage problem. Premier Zhou Enlai said, "Can we buy a few bottles to try?" The cadres sent down replied, "No need to buy them, we have already prepared some as gifts for the distinguished guests." The Prime Minister listened and repeatedly expressed his gratitude.

　　Leaving this small room, they arrived at the cooperative's factory for trial production of artificial cotton from rice straw. Prime Minister Sihanouk watched each process with great interest. The distinguished guests also took a clump of rice straw artificial cotton as a souvenir.

　　The sound of blacksmithing came from afar. Following the sound, the distinguished guests arrived at the cooperative's farm tool improvement factory. Here, seven or eight members were hammering ball bearings. They introduced to the Prime Minister that because ball bearings were not available for purchase, they were making them themselves by hand. Now, the cooperative has fully implemented ball bearingization, which has greatly improved the efficiency of waterwheels, carts, and vertical mills. Here, Prime Minister Sihanouk also visited various new-style improved farm tools.

　　Stepping out of the clean village, the distinguished guests walked in a single file into the "Storming Company" Communist Youth League's high-yield rice experimental field. Standing on the slender ridges, the dense, waist-high rice plants were a deep green, and some rice plants had already flowered and tasseled. The distinguished guests were immediately attracted by this scene of abundance. Liu Baofeng, the youth team leader, introduced to the Prime Minister that they had planted 6 mu of experimental fields, with 50,000 seedlings transplanted per mu, 2,000 jin of base fertilizer applied, and fertilizer applied four times after planting and water added eight times. They guaranteed a yield of 5,000 jin per mu. At this time, Premier Zhou Enlai said to Prime Minister Sihanouk: "Such rice fields are relatively good in Beijing, but not the best, and even less so in the whole country, because Hubei Province has already produced high-yield rice fields with a yield of more than 36,000 jin per mu. They have won the champion there." Vice Premier He Long smiled and said to the Prime Minister: "This year they lost, the youth have become old!" Wang Dehai, the director of this cooperative, said: "It seems that our conservative thinking is very serious. At first, we thought that a yield of 6,000 jin per mu would be about right; now, the brother cooperatives in other places have left us far behind!" Youth team leader Liu Baofeng confidently told the Prime Minister and the Premier: "We were conservative this year, but next year we will make a big effort and launch a satellite that will be famous throughout the country!"

　　What is the life of the members like? The distinguished guests found the answers from visiting peasant families and visiting the canteen. The distinguished guests came to the home of member Jiang Baoyu. His family of seven, those who go to school go to school, those who go to the fields go to the fields, and only the old lady Jiang, who is over fifty years old, stays at home. Entering the home of this poor peasant, the house was very clean, thick quilts were stacked on the bed, a thermos, teacups, and a large mirror were placed on the table in the center of the hall, and sheepskin coats for winter were hanging on the wall. It was clearly a picture of a well-fed and well-clothed peasant family.

　　"How much is your annual income?" the Prime Minister asked old lady Jiang.

　　"I don't remember how much the annual income is, I only know that we have grain to eat, clothes to wear, and pocket money. Life is getting better year by year!"

　　Prime Minister Sihanouk said: "You are very happy!"

　　In the cooperative's public canteen, where 446 members eat, the price list of tonight's meal on the blackboard aroused the great interest of the distinguished guests. It said: Rice 5 fen, large steamed bun 5 fen, corn bread 3 fen, stir-fried peppers 3 fen, braised winter melon 3 fen, pickled vegetables 1 fen. Prime Minister Sihanouk watched the white and large steamed buns and the fragrant stir-fried dishes with great interest, and repeatedly praised: "Good!" The canteen staff told the Prime Minister that since the canteen was opened, it had freed 78 women from household chores and allowed them to participate in labor in the fields like men.

　　More than an hour and a half later, when the distinguished guests were saying goodbye to the members with gifts from the members - lotus root, peppers, tomato sauce, and eggplant - the members gathered again to warmly see off the distinguished guests. They hoped that the distinguished guests would bring the greetings of the Chinese peasants to the Cambodian peasant brothers!

　　After leaving the agricultural cooperative, when the distinguished guests and Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long came to the Summer Palace, Vice Premier Chen Yi greeted the distinguished guests at the gate, and the guests enjoyed the lakeside scenery here in the evening.

　　“你们很幸福！”
　　——记西哈努克首相参观玉泉山农业社
　　新华社记者　于民生
    “你们很幸福”！这是西哈努克首相16日下午访问了北京郊区玉泉山农业社时钦佩地对社员们这样说。这句话道出了首相访问这个社的深刻印象。
    由周恩来总理和贺龙副总理陪同，柬埔寨的全体贵宾参观了这个合作社自办的工厂、丰产稻田、食堂，并访问了农民家庭。西哈努克首相是那样的全神贯注，兴致勃勃，他不断向社员们发出问题，又不时地同柬埔寨其他贵宾谈着他的美好印象。
    贵宾们到达这个合作社的时候，受到了社员们的热情欢迎。在欢迎群众中，西哈努克首相会见了一个十六岁的女学生，她叫王玉勤，在北京南郊一所农业学校读书，今天因为放假而回到家里来。
    “你毕业以后准备当农民还是当干部？”首相问这个女学生。
    “当农民，我的志愿就是从事农业。”王玉勤告诉首相。
    “毕业以后就回村里来吗？”首相又问。
      “完全听组织分配。”
    “过去种过田吗？”
    “没有。在学校里学会了种田，劳动改变了我的思想。”王玉勤朴实的回答，首相感到很满意，首相祝她实现美好的愿望。
    首相又会见了一批下放在这里劳动锻炼的干部。仔细一问，首相发现他们就是他在1956年访问中国时参观过的那个学校——中央民族学院的教职员们。
    “下放了多久？”首相问这些下放干部。
    “已经有半年了。”
    “有多少人？”
    “四十一个。”
    首相仔细的端详着他们那晒得黝黑的脸庞和那同农民一样的装束，然后称赞说：“你们同人民一起劳动和生活是我们学习的榜样。我们很钦佩你们。”首相又问：“你们作些什么劳动？”这些新农民们回答：和社员们一起在田间生产和办小工厂。
    于是，西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理等就由这些新农民们引导着去参观他们自办的工厂。
    在一间小屋里，堆满一瓶瓶制好的西红柿酱。新农民们告诉贵宾，这就是他们自办的西红柿加工厂生产的。每三斤西红柿能制一瓶，经过检验产品完全合格。每瓶市上售价九角，他们准备只卖五角。下放干部告诉首相，他们不是为了赚钱，主要因为今年的西红柿丰产，为了解决储存问题所以才进行加工的。周恩来总理说：“我们买几瓶回去尝一尝可以吗？”下放干部们回答：“用不着买，我们已准备了一些作为礼物送给贵宾们。”首相听了，一再表示感谢。
    走出这间小屋，就来到了合作社办的稻草试制人造棉的工厂。西哈努克首相非常有兴趣的观看了一道道工序。贵宾们并拿了一团稻草人造棉留作纪念。
    远远地传来了打铁的声音。朝着这响声走去，贵宾们就来到了合作社的农具改良厂。在这里，七八个社员正用铁锤在敲打滚珠。他们向首相介绍说，因为滚珠买不到，他们就用手工自己制造。现在这个合作社已经全部实现滚珠轴承化了，因而使水车、大车、立磨大大提高了工作效率。在这里，西哈努克首相还参观了各种新式改良农具。
    步出清洁的村庄，贵宾们鱼贯地走进了冲锋连共青团水稻丰产试验田。站在细长的田埂上眺望，齐腰深的密密麻麻的水稻一片深绿，有的稻棵已经扬花吐穗了。贵宾们马上被这丰收的景象吸引住了。青年队队长刘宝峰向首相介绍说，他们种的六亩试验田，每亩插秧五万蔸，施底肥二千斤，种后已经追了四次肥，放了八次水。保证亩产五千斤。这时，周恩来总理对西哈努克首相说：“这样的稻田在北京是比较好的，但还不算最好的，在全国就更不算最好的了，因为湖北省已经出现了亩产三万六千多斤的丰产稻田，那里中了状元。”贺龙副总理笑着对首相说：“今年他们输了，青年变成老年了！”这个合作社的主任王德海说：“看来，我们的保守思想很严重。起初，我们认为亩产六千斤差不多了；现在，其他地方的兄弟社远远地把我们抛在后面了！”青年队长刘宝峰充满信心地向首相和总理表示：“今年保守了，明年我们要大干一番，来一个名冠全国的卫星！”
    社员们生活怎样呢？贵宾们从访问农民家庭和参观食堂中找到了答案。贵宾们来到了社员姜宝玉的家里。他家的七口人，上学的上学，下田的下田，只有五十多岁的姜老太太一个人留在家里。走进这个贫农的家里一看，房子里非常清洁，床上叠着厚厚的被袄子，堂屋正中的桌子上摆着热水瓶，茶碗和一面大镜子，过冬穿的羊皮袄挂在墙上。一看就是一幅丰衣足食的农民家庭。
    “每年收入多少？”首相问姜老太太。
    “一年收入多少我记不清，我只知道，有粮食吃，有衣服穿，还有零花钱。生活一年比一年好！”
    西哈努克首相说：“你们很幸福！”
    在有四百四十六人用饭的社员公共食堂里，黑板上今天晚饭的饭菜价目引起了贵宾们的浓厚兴趣。那上面写着：米饭五分，大馒头五分、窝窝头三分，炒辣椒三分，红烧东瓜三分，咸菜一分。西哈努克首相极有兴趣的观看了那又白又大的馒头，以及那散发着香味的各种炒菜，连连称赞说：“好！”食堂的工作人员告诉首相，食堂办起来以后，就使七十八个妇女从家务劳动中解脱出来到田间和男子一样参加劳动了。
    一个半多小时以后，贵宾们带着社员们送的礼物——藕、辣椒、西红柿酱、茄子，向社员们道别的时候，社员们又一次聚集在一起热情欢送贵宾。他们希望贵宾们把中国农民的问候带给柬埔寨的农民兄弟！
    离开农业社以后，当贵宾们和周恩来总理、贺龙副总理一起来到了颐和园，这时，陈毅副总理在大门口迎接贵宾，宾主在这里欣赏了傍晚的湖山景色。（附图片）
