Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Asian and Australian public opinion widely condemns the United States for persisting in its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. The Burmese "Justice Daily" published an editorial on the 14th regarding the United States' insistence on adopting this die-hard policy, stating that it is unjust for the United States and its clique to continue opposing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. The "Justice Daily" said, "The People's Republic of China is an independent and powerful country today, and this fact is undeniable." It also said, "China possesses all the conditions to be a great power and has been recognized by Burma and many other countries."

The editorial stated that restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations would help the United Nations resolve many international issues.

The Sydney "Sun" published an editorial on the 12th regarding the memorandum issued by the U.S. State Department on the 11th, reaffirming the U.S. insistence on its policy of hostility towards China, pointing out that while China is growing stronger, the United States is still closing its eyes to reality. The newspaper believes that the U.S. government's support for the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan is equivalent to "backing a horse that is sure to lose."

A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 12th had to admit that Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and Ceylon all believe that the U.S. policy toward China is "shortsighted and that (the U.S.) reaffirming its attitude—especially at this time—is unfortunate."

　　亚澳舆论指责美国敌视中国
    新华社16日讯　亚澳舆论普遍谴责美国坚持与中国人民为敌的政策。缅甸“公正报”14日就美国坚持采取这种死硬政策发表社论说，美国和它的一伙继续反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，是不正当的。“公正报”说：“中华人民共和国今天是独立的、强大的国家，这个事实是无可否认的”，它还说“中国具备作为一个大国的一切条件，并且得到了缅甸和其他许多国家的承认”。
    社论说，使中国恢复它在联合国的合法席位，将有助于联合国解决许多国际问题。
    悉尼“太阳报”12日就美国国务院11日发表的关于重申美国坚持敌视中国政策的备忘录发表社论指出，当中国正在日益强大的时候，美国却仍然在闭着眼睛无视现实。这家报纸认为，美国政府支持台湾蒋介石集团就等于“支持一匹肯定要跑输的马”。
    合众国际社12日从东京发出的一条消息不得不承认：印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰等亚洲国家都认为美国对中国的政策是“近视的，并且认为（美国）重申它的态度—特别在目前这个时候——是不幸的”。
