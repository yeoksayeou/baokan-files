Where Did Little San Go?

My elder brother works outside the city, while my sister-in-law and I work in the county town. Only my mother stays at home to take care of my brother's child and my third younger brother, "Little San," who is in elementary school. "Little San" is thirteen years old this year. He usually helps my mother with housework after school, and the whole family loves him. These past two days, my sister-in-law has mentioned it to me several times: "The recent meetings at school are just too much. Little San has been leaving the dinner table to go out these past few days." My mother also said, "Little San only knows how to run around outside; he doesn't care if the family is busy or not?"

Yesterday, my elder brother returned. He had been away from home for several months on a business trip. And he has to leave today. For some reason, my sister-in-law brought up Little San's matter again. My mother also said that these days, only she is left to cook and take care of the child, implying that she wanted my brother to talk to Little San.

It was six o'clock in the afternoon, and Little San still hadn't returned. My brother was supposed to go to the station at seven thirty. The whole family finished eating, but Little San was still nowhere to be seen. My brother couldn't wait any longer, so my sister-in-law and I went to the station to see him off. In the waiting room, we heard that the train was about to arrive, and my brother hurriedly said goodbye to us. Suddenly, we heard a sharp voice shouting, "Who wants to read the newly arrived magazines? See 'New Observer' and 'East Wind'..." I found the voice familiar, but I didn't think about who it was. My brother said he wanted to buy a magazine to read on the train. My sister-in-law was about to go and buy one when the book-selling child who appeared in front of us was none other than Little San. My sister-in-law couldn't help but exclaim. Little San saw us and immediately ran over, smiling and grabbing my brother's hand, then turning to my sister-in-law and saying: After school, we are substituting for the post office to sell magazines, and we've already sold quite a few! My brother praised him incessantly. Little San leaned against my sister-in-law. My sister-in-law touched Little San's shoulders with both hands, speechless and stunned.

　　小三哪去了？
    哥哥在市外工作，我和嫂子在县城工作，只有母亲在家领着哥哥的一个小孩和在小学读书的三弟过日子。“小三”今年十三岁，平常放学回来就帮助母亲办理家务，全家都很爱他。这两天嫂子跟我说了好几次了：“学校最近的会议也太不像话了，小三这几天，老是放下饭碗就走。”母亲也说：“小三光知道在外面跑，他哪还管家里忙不忙？”
    昨天哥哥回来了，他因出差外地已有几个月没回家了。而且今天就要走。不知怎的，嫂子又提起了小三的事。母亲也说，这几天只剩下我一个人又做饭又领孩子了，意思是叫哥哥说说小三。
    下午六点了，还不见小三回来，哥哥七点半就该上车站了。全家吃完了饭还是不见小三。哥哥不能再等，我就和嫂子往车站送哥哥。在候车室里，听说火车快要进站了，哥哥就急忙和我们告别，忽然听到有个尖音喊道：“谁看新到的杂志，看‘新观察’，还有‘东风’……。我听这声音好熟，但没有细想是谁。哥哥说要买本杂志到火车上去看，嫂子刚要动身去买，不想出现在面前的卖书童正是小三。嫂子不禁叫了起来。小三看见我们立即跑过来，笑嘻嘻地拉住哥哥的手，并转向嫂子说：放学以后，我们代替邮局卖杂志，已卖了不少了。哥哥不住地夸奖。小三背靠着嫂子。嫂子双手摸着小三的双肩，呆呆地一言不发。
