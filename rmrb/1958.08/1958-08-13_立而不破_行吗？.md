Is "Establishing without Demolishing" Acceptable?
	Cao Kongrui

Currently, some universities are criticizing bourgeois academic thought in conjunction with revising their teaching syllabuses. The method of criticism starts with bourgeois academic thoughts that currently have a relatively large influence, combined with self-criticism. In addition to teachers, students also participate in the criticism, achieving "teaching each other." This is an important task in the process of universities uprooting white flags and planting red flags.

Most teachers support the criticism of their own bourgeois academic thought. They recognize that this is the key to completing the ideological revolution of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology after criticizing bourgeois individualism. Professors in the History Department of Peking University took the initiative to request criticism of their own bourgeois academic thought, forming a critical upsurge within the department of "close cooperation between teachers and students, with everyone striving to be first." However, there are still a few people who hold a negative attitude towards this work. Some, although prepared to liquidate their own bourgeois academic thought, have the idea of taking their time, hoping to carry out this work over three to five years. These people are still somewhat reluctant to let go of their old ways. Some fear that their academic achievements will be completely negated in the process of criticism, resulting in the destruction of decades of hard work. Some fear that after criticism, they will lose prestige among students and be unable to lecture. Of course, those who use bourgeois academic thought as their "foundation for survival" have even more ideological resistance.

Those who are unwilling to immediately criticize their own bourgeois academic thought have created various excuses to try to delay the time and escape an unavoidable ideological struggle. Some say that the bourgeois scholars and schools with the greatest influence should be criticized first, and that their own bourgeois academic thought is not systematic and not worth criticizing. Some believe that the Chinese bourgeoisie has not accepted Western civilization for very long, and that the influence of bourgeois academic thought is not deep. From the perspective of schools, they mainly learned some Western bourgeois teaching viewpoints and teaching methods, without a complete system, and do not need to spend much effort to criticize. They all believe that the main problem at present is the problem of "establishing." As long as a new teaching syllabus that conforms to Marxism-Leninism is drawn up, there is no need to "demolish," that is, it is possible to "establish without demolishing."

Saying that one's own bourgeois academic thought is not systematic may be a fact. Generally speaking, the foundation of Chinese bourgeois academic thought is relatively shallow, and most systems are incomplete, which reflects the characteristics of China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society before liberation. Chinese bourgeois scholars did not make many commendable achievements in old China, and most of them were peddling Western bourgeois goods. Some of them sold the things of capitalist countries to China unchanged, or with a superficial understanding; some used Chinese materials to illustrate according to the viewpoints of foreign bourgeoisies; and some, in addition to accepting the Western capitalist set of things, also mixed in the feudal views of their own country. Since they did not understand China's actual problems, of course, they could not solve China's actual problems. Although one's own bourgeois academic thought is fragmented and unsystematic, it is ultimately an anti-Marxist academic thought, belonging to the bourgeois academic school and belonging to the idealist system. Whether it is a large white flag or a small white flag, they are incompatible with Marxism and are engaged in fierce struggles with Marxism. In old China, bourgeois academic thought was rampant in academic circles and universities, poisoning countless young intellectuals. After liberation, the working people took power, and Marxism-Leninism took the leading position in academic circles and universities. After several repeated struggles, bourgeois academic thought has been criticized to a certain extent, but the root has not been eliminated and is still stubbornly resisting. In particular, many bourgeois scholars have put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and continue to peddle their idealist goods, which makes it easier to deceive people. In the teaching work of universities, the leading position of Marxism-Leninism is not yet consolidated, and many departments and offices have planted the white flag of the bourgeoisie. Bourgeois academic thought continues to poison young people, as evidenced by the countless facts revealed by students' big-character posters in the Double-Anti movement. Therefore, the idea that one's own bourgeois academic thought is not systematic, and that there are only some problems in teaching methods and teaching viewpoints, and does not need to be criticized is extremely absurd.

The error of the "establishing without demolishing" theorists lies in the fact that they oppose demolishing and establishing, and do not see the inseparable connection between the two. Demolishing and establishing are a unity of opposites. "No demolishing, no establishing" illustrates the relationship between the two. From the perspective of bourgeois scholars themselves, not thoroughly criticizing their own bourgeois academic thought hinders them from accepting Marxism-Leninism and prevents them from uprooting the white flag and planting the red flag. These two opposing thoughts cannot coexist peacefully in one person. Either the West wind prevails over the East wind, or the East wind prevails over the West wind. Only in the process of demolishing can we truly understand what should be established and how to establish it. Only then can we understand why bourgeois academic thought is wrong and why Marxism-Leninism is correct. Otherwise, it can only be "gilded outside, rotten inside." It is ostensibly Marxist-Leninist, but the content is anti-Marxist-Leninist. Are the lessons of the past few years not enough to illustrate this problem? Bourgeois philosophers like Feng Youlan have also read a lot of books on Marxism-Leninism. The papers he wrote are also full of Marxist phraseology. However, his idealist philosophical viewpoint has not been thoroughly criticized, and he is still peddling his idealist goods in his articles with old wine in new bottles. "Riding a white horse forward, running counter to it." This just shows that establishing without demolishing is absolutely impossible.

From another perspective, if the teacher's bourgeois academic thought is not well criticized, it is not easy to liberate the students' minds, hindering them from accepting Marxism-Leninism. If they do not understand the teacher's set of things and do not know what medicine is being sold in the gourd, they will develop superstitious ideas. Before the Chinese Department of Peking University criticized a certain old teacher's academic thought, many students blindly worshipped the teacher's academic status and attitude towards learning, and some students regretted not hearing his lectures. However, after this criticism, the cat was out of the bag, and the students realized that the teacher's goods were not to be desired. At the beginning of the criticism at Peking University, many students did not dare to participate in criticizing the teacher's bourgeois academic thought, thinking that they had not read as many books as the teacher and were afraid that they would not be able to criticize. When they liberated their minds and entered the actual battle, they realized that although they had not read as many books as the teacher, their position and viewpoint were relatively clear, and they could also judge the authenticity of the goods. Some teachers also believe that the students' speeches are enthusiastic and sharp, often touching on the key issues. After breaking the superstition of bourgeois academic thought, confidence also came. Now, students in the social science departments of Peking University have organized many groups and written dozens of critical articles, some of which are of high quality. In the criticism, they also exercised their ability to analyze problems and improved their Marxist-Leninist level. It can be seen from this that "establishing without demolishing" is unfavorable to both the criticized person and the students. This will only hinder the work of uprooting white flags and planting red flags.

Those who worry that their academic achievements will be completely negated in the process of criticism are also unnecessary. As the saying goes, "True gold fears no fire." If you have indeed made achievements in academics, no one can deny it, which is an objective existence. The problem is that bourgeois academic thought, because it is idealistic, is fundamentally wrong, which cannot but be completely negated. At the same time, negation and affirmation are also a unity of opposites. Without negation, there is no so-called affirmation. Under the premise of complete negation, some useful components of one's own academic thought will be affirmed. Only by first smashing the bourgeois ideological system can we talk about picking up scrap metal in the ruins. What scientists pursue is the truth. If the facts prove that what they are pursuing is wrong, they should not hesitate to abandon it and start over. There are many scientists in history who "realized today is right and yesterday was wrong" and dared to deny the old self and adhere to the truth, which is the model we should learn from.

Facts have proved that criticizing one's own bourgeois academic thought does not mean losing prestige among students and being unable to lecture, but rather gaining the love of students. As the saying goes, "I love my teacher, and I also love the truth." What students love first and foremost is the truth, which is Marxism-Leninism. If you insist on the old bourgeois academic thought and contradict the truth that students love, then there is a danger that you will not be able to lecture.

Many schools adopt the method of "teaching each other" through cooperation between teachers and students to jointly criticize bourgeois academic thought, which is a fast, good, economical, and efficient method of criticizing bourgeois academic thought. Those who have the idea of "establishing without demolishing" should quickly change their minds. Only by "demolishing and establishing at the same time" and "demolishing thoroughly and establishing firmly" can they advance quickly.

　　“立而不破”行吗？
　　曹孔瑞
    目前一些高等学校正结合修订教学大纲批判资产阶级学术思想。批判的方法是从目前有较大影响的资产阶级学术思想开始，结合进行自我批判。参加批判的除教师外还有学生，做到“教学相长”。这是高等学校拔白旗、插红旗过程中的一件重要工作。
    对于批判自己的资产阶级学术思想，大部分教师是表示拥护的。他们认识到这是在批判了资产阶级个人主义以后，完成思想上兴无灭资革命的关键。北大历史系的教授们主动的要求批判自己的资产阶级学术思想，在系内形成了“师生密切合作，人人争先恐后”的批判高潮。但也还有少数人对这一工作抱着消极的态度。有的人虽有清算自己的资产阶级学术思想的准备，但是抱着慢慢来的想法，希望把这一工作，放到三、五年内去进行。这些人对自己的旧的一套，还有些恋恋不舍。有的人则怕在批判过程中对自己的学术成就，被全盘否定，以致数十年心血，毁于一旦。有的人怕批判以后，在学生中失掉威信，上不了讲台。当然，那些以资产阶级学术思想作自己“安身立命”之所的人，思想上抵触更多。
    那些不愿意马上批判自己的资产阶级学术思想的人，就制造了各种借口，企图拖延时间，逃避一场不可避免的思想斗争。有的人说，首先应该批判那些影响最大的资产阶级学者和流派，自己的资产阶级学术思想不成体系，不值得批判。有的人认为，中国资产阶级接受西洋文明的时间并不长，资产阶级学术思想影响不深，从学校来讲，主要是学了一些西方资产阶级的教学观点和教学方法，没有整套的东西，不需要花多大力气去批判。他们都认为目前主要的问题是“立”的问题，只要订出一个合乎马列主义的新的教学大纲就行了，不必“破”，就是说，可以“立而不破”。
    说自己的资产阶级学术思想不成体系，这或许是事实。一般说来，中国资产阶级的学术思想根基比较浅薄，大部分体系不完整，这正是反映了解放前中国半殖民地半封建社会的特性。中国资产阶级学者在旧中国并不曾作出多少可以称道的成绩，大部分是贩卖西洋资产阶级的货色。他们有的把资本主义国家的东西原封不动，或一知半解的贩卖到中国来；有的根据外国资产阶级的观点引证中国材料，加以说明；有的则除了接受西洋资本主义的一套东西外，还揉合了本国的封建主义的观点。他们既然不了解中国的实际问题，当然也无法解决中国的实际问题。虽然自己的资产阶级学术思想是支离破碎，不成体系，但它终究是一种反马克思主义的学术思想，是属于资产阶级学术思想的流派，是属于唯心主义体系。大白旗也好，小白旗也好，它们都是和马克思主义不相容的，并和马克思主义进行着剧烈的斗争。在旧中国，资产阶级学术思想在学术界和高等学校泛滥着，毒害了无数的知识青年。解放以后，劳动人民掌握了政权，马克思列宁主义在学术界和高等学校取得了领导地位。经过了几次反复的斗争，资产阶级学术思想受到了一定的批判，但是孽根未除，还在负隅顽抗。特别是不少资产阶级学者披上了马克思列宁主义的外衣，继续贩卖其唯心主义的货色，更容易使人上当。在高等学校的教学工作中，马克思列宁主义的领导地位还不巩固，不少系室插上了资产阶级的白旗，资产阶级学术思想继续毒害着青年，这从双反运动中同学们的大字报所揭露出来的无数事实得到证明。因此那种认为自己的资产阶级学术思想不成体系，只是教学方法、教学观点上有些问题，不需要批判的想法是十分荒谬的。
    “立而不破”论者的错误，在于他们把破、立对立起来，没有看到两者不可分割的联系。破与立是矛盾的统一，“不破不立”，就是说明了两者的相互关系。从资产阶级学者本身说来，不彻底批判自己的资产阶级学术思想，就妨碍自己接受马列主义，就不能拔白旗插红旗。这两种对立的思想在一个人的身上是不可能和平共处的。不是西风压倒东风，就是东风压倒西风。也只有在破的过程中间，才能真正懂得应该立什么，怎样立。才能懂得资产阶级学术思想之所以错误和马列主义的所以正确。否则，还是只能“金玉其外，败絮其中。”表面上是马列主义的，而内容则是反马列主义的。过去几年来的经验教训，难道还不足以说明这个问题吗？像冯友兰这样的资产阶级哲学家，马列主义的书也读得不少。写出来的论文，也充满了马克思主义的辞句。但是他的唯心主义哲学观点没有受到彻底的批判，依然旧瓶新装，在文章中贩卖其唯心主义的货色。“骑着白马前进，背道而驰。”这正好说明了立而不破，是万万行不通的。
    从另一方面讲，教师的资产阶级学术思想没有很好的批判，学生的思想也不易解放，妨碍他们接受马克思列宁主义。他们对先生的那一套不摸底，不知道葫芦里卖什么药，便会产生迷信思想。北大中文系在批判某个老教师的学术思想以前，不少学生对这位教师的学术地位和治学态度抱着盲目崇拜的态度，有的学生因为没有听到他的课而引为遗憾。可是经过这次批判之后，西洋镜拆穿，学生们才知道这位教师的货色是要不得的。北大一开始批判时，有好多学生还不敢参加批判教师的资产阶级学术思想，认为自己看的书没有先生多，怕批判不了。等到解放了思想，投入了实际战斗，才知道自己读的书虽然没有老师多，但自己的立场观点比较明确，也可以判断货色的真假。有的教师也认为学生们的发言热情而尖锐，常常是接触到问题的关键。对资产阶级学术思想的迷信打破以后，信心也就来了。现在北大社会科学各系的同学已经组织成很多小组，写出了数十篇批判文章，有的文章质量也很高。在批判中，他们也就锻炼了自己分析问题的能力，提高了马列主义水平。由此可见，“立而不破”无论对被批判本人，对于同学都是不利的。这只会妨碍拔白旗插红旗的工作。
    那些担心自己的学术成就在被批判过程中被全盘否定的思想，也是不必要的。俗语说得好：“真金不怕火来炼”，如果自己在学术上确实有所成就，那是谁也否定不了的，这是客观存在。问题是资产阶级的学术思想，由于他是唯心主义的，因而根本上是错误的，这就不能不被全盘否定。同时否定和肯定也是对立的统一，没有否定，也无所谓肯定。在全盘否定的前提下，自己学术思想中某些有用的成分，是会被肯定下来的。只有先粉碎资产阶级的思想体系，然后才能谈到在废墟上拣破铜烂铁。科学家所追求的是真理，如果事实证明自己所追求的错了，就应该毫不犹豫的抛弃重来，在历史上不乏“觉今是而昨非”的敢于否定旧我，坚持真理的科学家，是我们学习的模样。
    事实证明，批判了自己的资产阶级学术思想，不是在学生中丧失威信，上不了讲台了。而是更能得到学生们的爱护。所谓“我爱我师，我亦爱真理”，同学们所爱的首先是真理，是马克思列宁主义。如果你坚持旧的资产阶级学术思想不放，和同学们所爱的真理矛盾，那倒会有上不了讲台的危险。
    不少学校采用教师和同学合作，共同批判资产阶级学术思想的“教学相长”的方法，是批判资产阶级学术思想的多快好省的方法。那些有“立而不破”思想的人，应该赶快改变自己的想法，只有“边破边立”，“破得狠，立得坚”，才能使自己很快前进。
