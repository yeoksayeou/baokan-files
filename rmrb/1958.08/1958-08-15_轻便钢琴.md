Lightweight Piano
    The piano faculty and students of the Central Conservatory of Music recently trial-produced a "mean-tone" lightweight piano.
    This lightweight piano appropriately reduces the range, eliminates the "highest" and "lowest" sets of keys that are rarely used in accompaniment, and is designed to be foldable. The entire volume is only three feet high, three feet wide, and one foot thick, and the total weight is only one hundred and thirty pounds, making it relatively easy to move. The keyboard design of this piano adopts the "mean-tone" created by Zhao Songguang, a young teaching assistant at the conservatory. Originally, it required learning twelve fingerings and being proficient in changing them to play scales in twelve keys, but now only two fingerings need to be learned. (Attached picture)

　　轻便钢琴
    中央音乐学院钢琴系师生最近试制成一架“平均键”轻便钢琴。
    这种轻便钢琴把音域适当缩小，取消了伴奏中极少用的“最高”和“最低”两组音键，并改为折迭式，整个体积只有三尺高、三尺宽、一尺厚，全部重量只有一百三十斤，移动比较方便。这种钢琴的键盘设计采用了这个学院青年助教赵宋光创造的“平均键”。原来要学会十二种指法而且变换娴熟才能弹奏的十二个调的音阶，现在只学会两种指法就行了。（附图片）
