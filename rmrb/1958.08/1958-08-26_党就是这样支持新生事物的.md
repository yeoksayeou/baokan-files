Column: Party Member's Letter

Comrade Editor:

There is something that constantly excites me, and I have wanted to tell you about it for a long time. After seeing Chairman Mao's remarks during his inspection in Tianjin, saying that government organizations should also run some subsidiary factories, I felt even more compelled to write to you quickly, hoping you would publish it in the newspaper so that everyone would know.

The matter is as follows: The rectification movement made me deeply realize that intellectuals must go into labor to transform themselves. But what should comrades who work in leading organizations do when it is not their turn to go down to the countryside for labor training? One day in early July, a thought suddenly popped into my mind: why not set up a factory in the organization, which could both produce wealth for the country and allow intellectuals to be trained through labor? Wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone? I discussed this idea with several Party members in the institute. Some agreed, some opposed, and some were noncommittal, and I couldn't make up my mind. So I went to Comrade Ma, the Party Secretary. As soon as he heard it, he said enthusiastically, "You want to set up a factory, that's a pretty novel idea. Wait a moment, I'll find you when I'm free!"

After dinner that day, Secretary Ma came to our office and discussed the factory with me. The next afternoon, the Party Committee held an enlarged meeting, which I also attended, specifically to study the issue of setting up a factory in the organization. The Party Committee finally unanimously agreed to the initiative to set up a factory and asked me to be the factory director. At that time, I was hesitant, feeling that I was just an ordinary Party member and how could I bear the responsibility of preparing for a factory. Comrade Li, the Dean of our institute (a member of the Party Committee), seemed to see through my thoughts and immediately said to me, "Of course there will be many difficulties, but the main one is the difficulty in solving the raw material problem. How about this, you still be the factory director, and I will be the supply section chief of the factory." The Dean's words gave me infinite strength. The Party supports me like this, what concerns can I still have? I agreed.

Our decision to set up a factory in the organization was announced, and the masses, especially the young intellectuals, quickly became excited. Some signed up, some donated money, and the comrades in the translation office donated 5,000 yuan of manuscript fees all at once. Many comrades voluntarily participated in the preparatory work for the factory in their spare time, some working until late at night, even all night long. At this time, I further realized how wise and correct it was for the Party Committee to support my initiative.

The factory was set up. On the morning of July 17th, the cupola furnace in our factory's foundry workshop poured out the first molten iron. People's emotions were as boiling as the molten iron. But unexpectedly, due to insufficient temperature, the molten iron cooled down before it could be cast into castings. Everyone's enthusiasm also cooled down immediately. Just at this time, our Party Secretary and Dean arrived. Dean Li said, "It doesn't matter, this is a new thing, we haven't done it before, we have no experience, failure is inevitable at the beginning, as long as we are willing to work hard, we will definitely succeed." He also studied the reasons for the failure with us, and the next day we produced qualified products.

The Party, what a great and 친절 word. When you lose your way, it points you out, teaches you, when you encounter difficulties, it helps you, supports you, and when your thoughts and emotions are abnormal, it guides you and encourages you in time. As a member of such a party, I feel infinitely proud. Dedicating everything to the cause of the Party is my heartfelt wish. (Attached picture)

### 党就是这样支持新生事物的

专栏：党员来信

　　党就是这样支持新生事物的编辑同志：
    有一件事情，不断地激动着我的心，早就想告诉你们。前些天看了毛主席在天津视察时说机关也要办点附属工厂的话，更加使我觉得非赶快写信给你们不可，希望你们在报上发表出来，让大家都知道。
    事情是这样的：整风运动使我深深体会到知识分子必须到劳动中去改造自己，可是在领导机关中工作，一时又轮不到下放劳动锻炼的同志怎么办呢？7月初的一天，在我脑海里突然出现了一个念头，办个机关工厂，既能为国家生产财富，又能让知识分子到劳动中锻炼，岂不是一举两得？我把这个想法同院里几个党员同志谈了，有的赞成，有的反对，有的却不加可否，我也拿不定主意。就去找党委马书记。他一听就热情地说：“你们要办工厂，这个想法倒挺新鲜，等一会，我有空就去找你吧！”
    当天晚饭以后，马书记就来到我们的办公室和我研究办工厂的事情。第二天的下午，党委会又召开扩大会议，我也列席，专门研究了机关办工厂的问题。党委会最后一致同意办工厂的倡议，并且要我当厂长。当时，我很犹豫，感到自己是个普通党员，如何担得起筹办一个工厂的责任。我院李院长（党委委员）仿佛看透了我的心思，马上对我说：“困难当然很多，但主要是原材料的困难不好解决，这样吧，你还是当厂长，我当厂里的供应科长。”院长的几句话，给我增加了无限的力量，党这样支持我，我还能有什么顾虑呢？我答应了。
    我们创办机关工厂的决定公布了，群众，特别是青年知识分子，很快沸腾起来，报名的报名，捐钱的捐钱，翻译室的同志们一下子就捐稿费五千元。许多同志在业余时间自愿参加工厂的筹建工作，有的忙到深夜，甚至忙个通宵。这时我才进一步体会到党委所以支持我这个创议，是多么英明，多么正确。
    工厂办起来了，7月17日早晨，我们工厂铸造车间的化铁炉第一次流出了炽热的铁水。人们的情绪也像铁水一样沸腾起来。但是想不到由于温度不够，铁水未浇成铸件就冷却了。大家的热情也顿时冷却下来。正在这个时候，我们的党委书记和院长赶来了。李院长说：“算不了什么，这是新事情，咱们没搞过，没经验，开始时难免要失败，只要我们肯干，一定干得成功。”并和我们一起研究失败的原因，第二天我们就炼出了合格的产品。
    党，这是多么伟大而又多么亲切的字眼，当你迷失方向的时候，它指点你，教导你，当你碰到困难的时候，它帮助你，支持你，当你思想情绪不正常的时候，它又及时开导你，鼓励你。作为这样一个党的成员，真是感到无限的自豪。献出一切为党的事业奋斗，这就是我衷心的愿望。（附图片）
