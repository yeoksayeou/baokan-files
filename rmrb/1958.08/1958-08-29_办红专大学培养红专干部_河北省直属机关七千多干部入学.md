Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 27th. Hebei Province's directly subordinate organs have established thirty-six Red and Expert Universities. These schools have established more than 130 departments according to the different requirements of机关 cadres. More than 7,000 students have enrolled in the schools. Almost 100% of cadres in units that have established Red and Expert Universities have participated in the study.

In the second half of this year, the Red and Expert Universities of various organs are all studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the Party's general line for socialist construction. The students are closely integrating their studies with the work needs of their departments and the ideological situation of the cadres. The Red and Expert University of the Health Department combined the fourth stage of the rectification campaign with cadres writing personal ideological summaries and taught "Making a Stink of the Bourgeois Individualism of Health Personnel," with concrete content based on the actual materials of the department. The Red and Expert University of the Broadcasting Station, in response to the ideological situation of intellectuals in the unit, taught "The Party's Absolute Leadership Over Broadcasting." The heads of various departments of the Red and Expert Universities are generally the directors of the business in charge, and study and work are unified.

The Red and Expert Universities of various organs must be combined with factories and farms run by the organs, so that theory and practice are closely linked. The Health Department has established seven factories, one Chinese medicine plantation, and one medical animal breeding farm. The Broadcasting Station has trial-produced a simple portable tape recorder. The Postal and Telecommunications Bureau can produce a variety of telecommunications equipment. The Red and Expert Universities of some units have formed teaching and research sections, determined to run the Red and Expert Universities well.

　　办红专大学培养红专干部
    河北省直属机关七千多干部入学
    新华社天津27日电　河北省直属机关已办起红专大学三十六所。这些学校根据机关干部的不同要求，共设一百三十多个系。入校学习的学员已达七千多人，凡设红专大学的单位，几乎百分之百的干部参加了学习。
    各机关的红专大学今年下半年都在学习毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和党的社会主义建设总路线，学员们紧密结合本部门的工作需要和干部思想情况进行学习。卫生厅红专大学结合整风第四阶段干部写个人思想总结，讲授了“搞臭卫生人员的资产阶级个人主义”，具体内容都是本部门的活材料。广播电台的红专大学针对本单位知识分子的思想情况，讲授了“党对广播事业的绝对领导”。红专大学的各科系主任，一般都由主管业务的处长担任，学习、工作有统一安排。
    各机关的红专大学都要和机关办的工厂、农场等相结合，使理论与实践密切联系起来。卫生厅已办起七个工厂，一个中药种植场，一个医用动物饲养场；广播电台已试制成了简易手提录音机；邮电局已能生产多种电讯器材。有些单位的红专大学已组成教研室，决心把红专大学办好。
