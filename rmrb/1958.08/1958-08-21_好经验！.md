Editorial Note:

Good Experience!

    Shanxi Province is carrying out the "using summer to promote autumn" campaign, mobilizing the masses to conscientiously summarize the experiences of the summer harvest, using them to guide autumn field management, and striving for an even greater autumn harvest. In more than fifty days, they have already achieved significant results, and the autumn field management work has been done excellently!

    This is a good leadership method. If leading cadres in all regions and departments can often attach importance to summarizing work, especially mobilizing the masses to summarize their own recently experienced work, absorbing experience from it, improving upon it, and universally promoting it, then it can be believed that all work will advance rapidly on the existing foundation, and all kinds of production will inevitably achieve one greater harvest after another.

    Why can doing this achieve such significant results? The reason is very simple, because this is the leadership method of the mass line, and it is also the leadership method of using the abstract to lead the concrete.

　　好经验！
    山西省开展“以夏促秋”运动，发动群众认真总结夏季丰收的经验，用以指导秋田管理，争取秋季更大丰收。五十多天来已经取得明显成绩，秋田管理工作做得十分出色！
    这是一个好的领导方法。如果各地区、各部门的领导干部都能经常重视总结工作，特别是发动群众总结自身刚刚经历过的工作，从中吸取经验，加以提高，普遍推广，那么可以相信，一切工作都会在现有的基础上飞速向前，各种生产必然会取得一个比一个更大的丰收。
    为什么这样做就能取得如此重大的功效呢？原因很简单，因为这是群众路线的领导方法，这也是以虚带实的领导方法。
