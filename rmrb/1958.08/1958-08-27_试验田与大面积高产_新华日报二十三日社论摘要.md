Xinhua Daily August 23rd Editorial Summary:

Experimental Fields and Large-Scale High Yields

Jiangsu Province has achieved high and abundant yields of early autumn crops over large areas. The average yield of early rice on 2.6 million mu throughout the province was 1,014 jin per mu, an increase of 1.4 times compared to last year. The Suzhou Special District's 628,000-plus mu of early rice yielded 1,176 jin per mu. Drought-resistant autumn crops are also performing well; in Huai'an County, 170,000 mu of corn yielded 1,203 jin per mu.

The large-scale bumper harvest of early rice and the trend towards large-scale bumper harvests of mid- and late-autumn crops are due to many factors, and the large-scale cultivation of experimental fields by cadres at all levels and departments has played a very active role. Cadres at all levels and departments appear as ordinary laborers, most effectively eliminating the "three winds and five airs," strengthening the ties between cadres and the masses, and stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses. Cadres cultivate experimental fields and quickly learn the skills of leading production through labor practice. At the same time, most experimental fields take the lead in various technical measures, acting as pioneers and banners.

Cultivating experimental fields is implementing a revolution in leadership style; cultivating experimental fields is developing leadership methods that combine the general with the individual, and leadership with the masses; cultivating experimental fields is learning necessary professional and technical knowledge, and striving to become proletarian experts in various industries. This is the mainstream of the current cultivation of experimental fields by cadres at all levels. However, in addition to the mainstream, some noteworthy situations have also emerged: some people one-sidedly exaggerate the role of experimental fields in launching "satellites," and regard launching "satellites" as the ultimate goal of cultivating experimental fields. As a result, some people pay great attention to boosting small-area high-yield "satellites," but do not sing the praises of the miracles of large-area high yields created by millions of people with even greater enthusiasm; a few people only pay attention to field processing and management in experimental fields, and do not pay attention to using more energy to mobilize the masses to strive for large-area high yields.

We should warmly cheer the high-yield "satellites" launched in the experimental fields. Because it is a gratifying and lovely fruit of the close combination of leading cadres with technicians and peasants, hard work, and painstaking research of technology. We should and must use the high yield of experimental fields to drive the high yield of large areas. The high yield of experimental fields is very valuable, but the most important and fundamental thing is the high yield of large areas. Because the output of the vast majority of experimental fields is relatively high, but the area is still small. Only when the grain marshal ascends to the account and leads the generals of cotton, oil crops, silkworms, pigs, aquatic products, etc. to set out together can the food problem in our country be fundamentally solved, and can the great development of urban and rural economy and cultural undertakings be promoted. All localities should strive for high yields in large areas and strive to get the "first place in total score." This is the main sign to measure whether the leaders at all levels have mustered up enough energy. At the same time, we must also strive to create excellent results in experimental fields.

It is true that cadres who cultivate experimental fields should strive to pilot "rockets" and launch "satellites." However, it should not be demanded that the cadres' experimental fields must launch the highest and largest local "satellites." Everyone knows that compared with the masses, cadres are a minority after all, while the masses are the majority. "Everyone is a sage." If the broad masses are fully mobilized, they can create unexpected miracles. The view that only the cadres' experimental fields can launch high-yield satellites, in fact, exposes that this is a manifestation of a few people's superstition of themselves and disbelief in the masses. Vigorously engage in mass movements and vigorously engage in large-area high yields. More and larger "satellites" will inevitably be launched in the large fields planted by the masses. Because these "satellites" appear from large-area high yields, their measures are more universal and easier to promote large-area high yields. The responsibility of the cadres is to discover and promote the advanced experience among the masses on the basis of large-area leaps forward, and further drive a wider area.

As experimental fields have developed to this day, two different situations have actually emerged, that is, there are two different types of experimental fields: one is demonstrative in nature with large-area high yields, and the other is scientific research in nature. We should embrace both types of experimental fields with infinite revolutionary enthusiasm and promote a bold spirit of originality. At the same time, we must also maintain a pragmatic and down-to-earth scientific attitude. Otherwise, it will damage its due style and make the experimental fields detached from the masses and from reality.

The next three months are a decisive period for winning a comprehensive victory in this year's agricultural production leap forward, and it is also a critical moment to prepare for a greater leap forward in next year's production. All localities must further clarify the relationship between experimental fields and large-area high yields, muster up their energy, fight heroically, and ensure the realization of large-area high yields.

　　试验田与大面积高产
　　新华日报二十三日社论摘要
    江苏省早秋作物取得了大面积高额丰产。全省二百六十万亩早稻平均亩产一千零十四斤，比去年增产一点四倍。苏州专区六十二万八千多亩早稻，亩产一千一百七十六斤。旱谷早秋作物也不甘示弱，淮安县十七万亩玉米，亩产达到一千二百零三斤。
    早稻大面积丰收和中晚秋大面积丰收趋势的形成，原因是多方面的，而各级各部门干部大种试验田，起着十分积极的作用。各级各部门干部大种试验田，以普通劳动者的面貌出现，最有效地打掉了三风五气，密切了干部和群众的联系，激发了群众的干劲。干部种试验田，通过劳动实践，很快学会领导生产的本领，同时，大多数试验田在各项技术措施上一马当先，起着先锋和旗帜的作用。
    种试验田，实行领导作风上的革命；种试验田，发展一般与个别相结合、领导与群众相结合的领导方法；种试验田，学习必要的业务知识和技术知识，力争成为各种行业的无产阶级的专家，这是当前各级干部种试验田的主流。但是，在主流之外，也出现了一些值得注意的情况：这就是有些人片面地夸大了试验田放“卫星”的作用，把放“卫星”看成是种试验田的最终目的。影响所及，就使得有些人对放小面积高产“卫星”很注意鼓气，而对千百万群众所创造的大面积高产的奇迹却没有以更大的热情去歌颂；有少数人只注意了试验田的田间加工管理，而没有注意用更多的精力去发动群众争取大面积高产。
    试验田中放出了高产“卫星”，应当热烈欢呼。因为它正是领导干部同技术人员和农民紧密结合，辛勤劳动，刻苦钻研技术的一项可喜可爱的果实。我们应该而且必须以试验田的高产带动大面积的高产，试验田的高产是很可贵的，但最重要最根本的还是大面积高产。因为绝大多数试验田的产量虽然比较高，但面积终究很小，只有使粮食元帅升帐，带领棉花、油料、蚕桑、生猪、水产等大将一齐出马，才能从根本上解决我国的粮食问题，才能促进城乡经济和文化事业的大发展。各地都应该力争大面积高产，力争得“总分第一”，这是衡量各级领导是否鼓足了干劲的主要标志。同时，也要力争在试验田上创造优异的成绩。
    干部种试验田，固然应该力争驾“火箭”、放“卫星”。但是，不应当强求干部试验田必须放出当地最高最大的“卫星”。人们都知道，干部和群众比较起来，干部毕竟是少数，而群众是多数。“众人是圣人”广大群众充分发动起来，就能创造出意想不到的奇迹。那种认为只有干部试验田才能放出高产卫星的看法，事实上暴露了这是少数人迷信自己，不相信群众的表现。大搞群众运动，大搞大面积高产，群众所种的大田中必然会放出更多更大的“卫星”，由于这种“卫星”是从大面积高产中出现的，它的措施更带有普遍性，更易于推动大面积高产。干部的责任，就是要在大面积跃进的基础上，发现与推广群众中的先进经验，进一步带动更广大的面。
    试验田发展到今天，实际上已经出现了两种不同的情况，也就有两种不同性质的试验田：一种是带有大面积高产示范性质的，一种是带有科学研究性质的。我们不论对那种试验田都应该抱着无限的革命热情，发扬大胆的独创精神，同时，也必须抱着实事求是、踏踏实实的科学态度。否则，就会损伤它应有的风格，使试验田脱离群众，脱离实际。
    今后三个月，是赢得今年农业生产大跃进的全面胜利的决定性时期，又是准备来年生产更大跃进的紧要时刻。各地必须进一步明确试验田与大面积高产的关系，鼓足干劲，英勇奋战，保证大面积高产的实现。
