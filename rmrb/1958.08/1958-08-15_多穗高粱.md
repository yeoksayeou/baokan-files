Multi-Headed Sorghum

　　"Multi-headed sorghum," also known as "multi-headed sorghum," "eight-branched," "branched sorghum," "nine-headed bird," and "five-dragon head," is very popular among farmers in various regions because it has excellent characteristics that ordinary sorghum does not possess. At present, most provinces in Northeast and North China cultivate it. Hebei, Henan, and other provinces have expanded the planting of this sorghum variety this year, with a total area of about 2 million mu in Hebei Province. Ningxia is also trying to plant it this year.

　　Where did this "multi-headed sorghum" variety come from? According to agricultural science department records, it originated in South Africa and is planted in the south-central United States and throughout Europe. It was introduced from abroad in 1947 and tested at the former North China Agricultural Science Institute; from 1950, it was tested in Jinan, Cangxian, Tangshan, Gongzhuling, and other places. Through trial planting in some areas and large-scale cultivation on a small number of farms, the seeds of "multi-headed sorghum" began to spread.

　　"Multi-headed sorghum" has many excellent characteristics, which can be summarized as: ① Strong root system, strong tillering ability (generally three to five effective tillers, and up to ten), and a certain resistance to drought, waterlogging, and light alkali. ② Short stalk, tight ears, strong wind resistance, and not weak resistance to sorghum smut and aphids. ③ Early maturity (generally a growth period of 100 to 120 days), which is beneficial for crop rotation.

　　High yield potential is also a prominent characteristic of this variety. In Chaoyang, Liaoning, and Funing, Hebei, the "multi-headed sorghum" that was tested reached yields of 500 to 700 jin per mu in the past two years, and a few could produce more than 1,000 jin. In 1957, the national sorghum record—an area of 16 mu, with an average yield of 1,465 jin per mu—was created by the Dayao Pu Cooperative in Jinghai County, Hebei Province. In Suihua County, Heilongjiang, the unit yield of "multi-headed sorghum" was also more than three times higher than that of local general sorghum.

　　"Multi-headed sorghum" belongs to the sweet-stalk type and is a dual-purpose seed for rice and feed. Its seed has a rice yield of 82%, the brown rice is red, the polished rice is grayish-white, the powder is slightly sticky, and the nutritional components are high (containing 15.4% protein); the stems and leaves are juicy and contain a certain amount of sugar during the maturity period, and the feed value is very high. After the seeds of "multi-headed sorghum" are mature, the stems and leaves have not yet dried up, so the straw can be ensiled at the same time as the seeds are harvested. (Attached picture)

### 多穗高粱

　　多穗高粱
    “多穗高粱”又叫“多头高粱”“八棵杈”“杈子高粱”“九头鸟”“五龙头”等。因为它具有一般高粱所没有的优良特性，所以很受各地农民欢迎，目前东北、华北地区多数省份都有栽培。河北、河南等省今年都扩种了这个高粱品种，河北省总面积有二百万亩左右。宁夏今年也试种了。
    “多穗高粱”这个品种是哪里来的呢？据农业科学部门资料记载，它原产南非，美国中南部和欧洲各地都有种植。1947年由外国引进，在前华北农业科学研究所试种；1950年起先后在济南、沧县、唐山、公主岭等地试种。通过一些地区的试种和少数农场较大面积的栽培，“多穗高粱”的种子才开始传播。
    “多穗高粱”的优良特性很多，概括起来是：①根系强大，分蘖力强（一般有效分蘖三至五个，多的十个左右），对旱、涝、轻碱也有一定抵抗性。②秆矮、穗紧，抗风力强，抗高粱黑穗病、蚜虫的性能也不弱。③成熟早（一般生长期一百天到一百二十天），有利倒茬。
    有高度丰产潜力，也是这个品种突出的特性。在辽宁朝阳和河北抚宁试种的“多穗高粱”，去、前两年亩产量就达到五百到七百斤，少数可产千斤以上。1957年全国高粱最高纪录——十六亩面积，平均亩产一千四百六十五斤，创造单位河北省静海县大邀铺社。在黑龙江绥化县，“多穗高粱”的单位产量也比当地一般高粱高三倍以上。
    “多穗高粱”属甜茎型，米、饲料兼用种。它的籽实的出米率82％，糙米红色，精米灰白，粉质略粘，营养成分较高（含蛋白质15.4％）；茎叶在成熟期多汁并含有一定糖分，饲料价值很大。“多穗高梁”籽实成熟以后，茎叶还没有干枯，因此可以在收获籽实的同时青贮秸秆。（附图片）
