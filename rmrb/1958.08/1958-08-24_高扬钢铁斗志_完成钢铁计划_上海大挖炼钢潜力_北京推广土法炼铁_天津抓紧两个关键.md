Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 23rd, reporter He Changhua reports: Shanghai's steel industry sector is both rapidly building and also trying every possible means to tap the production potential of existing steelmaking furnaces. These days, factories are taking emergency measures and launching a new high tide of competition to produce more steel and produce it faster.

Since the beginning of this year, the existing steelmaking furnaces here have already tapped great potential. The steel output in the first seven months increased by 28.3% compared with the same period last year, producing more than 800 tons of steel. The traditional pattern of declining production in hot weather has been broken. Steelworkers braved the heat in front of the furnaces and produced more than 7,000 tons of steel last month than in June. After the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call for a greater leap forward on the 15th of this month, the steelworkers' enthusiasm for tapping potential became even stronger, and new records for rapid steelmaking emerged one after another. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, one of the eight red banner factories in the city, used a new national record of blowing 213 heats of steel a day with the three converters in the No. 1 Converter Workshop to welcome this call. The open hearth workshop also continuously created seven new steelmaking records on the 15th and 16th. The No. 3 Steel Plant, the No. 6 Steel Plant, the Shanghai Machine Repair General Plant and other factories have taken various emergency measures to catch up with the red banner of the No. 1 Steel Plant.

Greater technological reforms have also emerged. The open hearth workshop of the No. 1 Steel Plant began to use the "ground casting" method yesterday, which can increase the steel output of each furnace from 20 tons last year to 50 tons, making the furnace output of two open hearth furnaces equal to that of five open hearth furnaces last year. After the engineering and technical personnel broke through the conservative idea that "furnace output cannot be further increased" in the No. 3 Steel Plant, they boldly adopted an important reform, adding some molten iron when the steel is about to be tapped, so that these molten iron can quickly turn into steel. They increased the furnace output of the two open hearth furnaces from 20 tons to 26 or 27 tons. The steelworkers also boldly and carefully increased the gas volume and air volume, shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel by about 20 minutes. In July, the average daily steel output per square meter of furnace bottom in this open hearth workshop reached 12.487 tons, continuing to maintain the highest level in the country.

All steel plants have recently strengthened the organization and leadership of production, striving to better complete the steelmaking plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting on indigenous iron smelting at the Da Hanji Iron Smelting Plant in Zhoukoudian on the 23rd. This iron smelting plant is a pilot plant for the Municipal Party Committee to carry out indigenous iron smelting. After 40 days of experiments, three indigenous iron smelting blast furnaces have been able to smoothly produce gray iron. Yesterday's on-site meeting was to promote the iron smelting technology of this plant throughout the city, and at the same time called on the whole party and the whole people to mobilize and engage in indigenous iron smelting on a large scale, and try every possible means to make the existing and newly built small indigenous blast furnaces smoothly produce iron.

The indigenous iron smelting blast furnace of this factory uses local crucible clay and quartz stone as refractory materials, and uses cold air (boiler engine blowing) smokeless coal to smelt iron. An indigenous blast furnace with a volume of 0.9 cubic meters reached a daily output of 650 kilograms on the fifth day after the furnace was started; another indigenous blast furnace with a volume of 3 cubic meters reached a daily output of 659 kilograms on the second day after the furnace was started. The quality of the iron is very good. The successful experiments of these indigenous blast furnaces have solved the current difficulties of lacking refractory bricks, metallurgical coke and electric blowers, and opened up broad prospects for the large-scale establishment of small blast furnaces. In terms of construction time, it only takes ten days from breaking ground to building the furnace to producing iron, and the operation can be mastered with only one week of study.

Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the on-site meeting: Beijing has established a number of small blast furnaces, but the number is still very small, and most of them do not produce iron normally. This situation must be quickly reversed. The current task is to mobilize the whole party and the whole people. Focus on indigenous methods and small scale, follow the mass line, rely on our own efforts, seize the time, and quickly establish a number of small indigenous blast furnaces in the suburbs where there are mineral deposits. At the same time, we must seize the time to solve various technical problems in small blast furnace iron smelting, so that the existing and newly built small blast furnaces can produce iron as soon as possible, and gradually make it produce smoothly and produce more; strive to create high-yield records. Zheng Tianxiang also pointed out: In addition to carrying out indigenous iron smelting on a large scale in the suburbs (especially in the districts with iron ore and coal mines), the districts in the city, as well as factories, construction enterprises, schools, and agencies, should also actively participate in this indigenous iron smelting cause. The method is: contribute equipment, contribute funds, and contribute technology to the suburbs where there are mineral deposits, and jointly build iron smelting furnaces with the local people. Zheng Tianxiang asked the party committees at all levels to have a person in charge personally take command, and the heads of industrial ministries and bureaus should go to the front line and establish special agencies to specifically grasp the work of mining, smelting, transportation, material and equipment supply, and labor organization.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 23rd. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has held meetings for several days to focus on production and steel, requiring factories and enterprises throughout the city to regard the completion of the national plan as the top political task, and requiring all departments to focus all work closely on production. On the 22nd, the Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of the secretaries of the district committees and heads of industrial departments, calling on all units and departments to mobilize urgently, strive for the top, and overfulfill the national steel production plan.

The Municipal Party Committee analyzed the current production situation: the key lies in raw materials, and the key to raw materials lies in equipment. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee requires all parties to go all out, and the steel and machinery industries to rise together. In terms of machinery, the first priority is to meet the needs of metallurgical equipment, such as electric motors and blowers. Regarding steel production, specific tasks and measures were put forward. In addition to the Tianjin Steel Plant and the Xinxing Steel Plant must resolutely complete the national plan indicators, the Tianjin Steel Plant is required to put the three converters originally planned to be put into production at the end of the first quarter of next year into production on September 25th of this year, and to build five more converters. In order to realize these measures, the Municipal Party Committee requires all relevant units and departments to take action immediately in a combat posture, carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation, and strive to overfulfill the national plan.

At the meeting, the Tianjin Steel Plant and the Xinxing Steel Plant both guaranteed to overfulfill the plan; the construction and installation departments guaranteed to complete the construction and installation of the new plant ahead of schedule. The Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau guaranteed to complete the production task of 750 blowers in August and 670 blowers in September. (Attached picture)

　　高扬钢铁斗志　完成钢铁计划
    上海大挖炼钢潜力　北京推广土法炼铁　天津抓紧两个关键
    本报上海23日电　记者贺昌华报道：上海钢铁工业部门在一面抓快速建设的同时，一面又千方百计地挖掘原有炼钢炉的生产潜力。这几天，各厂都采取了紧急措施，掀起了多出钢、快出钢的竞赛新高潮。
    今年以来，这里原有的炼钢炉已经挖出了很大的潜力，前七个月的钢产量比去年同期增长28.3％，多炼出八百多吨钢。历年来热天生产下降的规律已被打破，炼钢工人们冒着炉前的酷热在上月比6月多炼出七千多吨钢。本月15日中共上海市委发出跃进再跃进的号召以后，炼钢工人们挖潜力的干劲更猛了，快速炼钢的新纪录层出不穷。全市工厂中八面红旗之一的上海第一钢铁厂，第一转炉车间的三座转炉以一天吹炼二百一十三炉钢的全国新纪录来迎接这个号召。平炉车间也在15、16日两天连续创造了七次炼钢新纪录。第三钢铁厂、第六钢铁厂、上海机修总厂等厂，都采取了各种紧急措施，猛追第一钢铁厂这面红旗。
    更大的技术改革也出现了。第一钢铁厂平炉车间昨天开始采用了
  “地铸”的方法，可使每一炉的钢产量由去年的二十吨提高到五十吨，使两座平炉的炉产量等于去年的五座平炉。第三钢铁厂在工程技术人员打破了“炉产量不能再提高”的保守思想以后，大胆地采取了一项重要改革，在快要出钢的时候，再加进一部分铁水，使这些铁水很快就变成钢。他们把两座平炉的炉产量由二十吨提高到二十六、七吨。炼钢工人们还胆大心细地加大了煤气量和风量，使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短二十分钟左右。7月份这个平炉车间平均每天每一平方公尺炉底的钢产量达到了十二点四八七吨，继续保持着全国的最高水平。
    各个钢铁厂最近都加强了对生产的组织领导工作，力争更好地完成炼钢计划。
    本报讯　中共北京市委23日在周口店大韩继炼铁厂举行土法炼铁的现场会议。这个炼铁厂是市委进行土法炼铁的试点厂。经过四十天的试验，有三个炼铁土高炉已能顺利出灰口铁。昨天的现场会议，就是在全市范围内推广这个厂的炼铁的技术，同时号召全党全民动员起来，大搞土法炼铁，并千方百计使已建和新建的小土高炉顺利出铁。
    这个工厂的炼铁土高炉，是用当地的坩土和石英石做耐火材料，用冷风（锅驼机鼓风）无烟煤炼铁。一座容积为零点九立方公尺的土高炉，开炉后第五天，日产量就达到六百五十公斤；另一座容积为三立方公尺的土高炉，开炉第二天，日产量就达到六百五十九公斤。铁的质量很好。这些土高炉试验的成功，解决了目前缺少耐火砖、冶金焦和电动鼓风机的困难，为大量建立小高炉开辟了广阔的道路。在建设时间上由破土筑炉到出铁只需十天，操作只要学习一周即可掌握。
    中共北京市委书记处书记郑天翔在现场会议上指出：北京市已建立起一批小高炉，但是数量还很少，而且大部分出铁不正常，这种状况必须迅速扭转。当前的任务是全党全民动员。以土、小为主，走群众路线，自力更生，抓紧时间，很快在郊区有矿藏的地方建立起一批小型土高炉来。同时要抓紧解决小高炉炼铁中的各种技术问题，使已建和新建的小高炉早日出铁，并要逐步使它出得顺、出得多；争取创高产纪录。郑天翔还指出：除在郊区各区（特别是有铁矿、煤矿的各区），要大搞土法炼铁，城区各区，以及各工厂、建筑企业、学校、机关，也应当积极参加这种土法炼铁事业。办法是：出设备、出资金、出技术，到郊区有矿藏的地方，与当地合搞炼铁炉。郑天翔要求各级党委要有一负责人亲自挂帅，工业部长局长要亲临前线，并成立专门机构，把开矿、冶炼、运输、物资和设备供应、劳动力组织等工作具体抓起来。
    本报天津23日电　中共天津市委连日开会抓生产，抓钢铁，要求全市工厂企业把完成国家计划当作头等政治任务，要求各个部门把一切工作紧紧围绕生产进行。22日，市委召开了各区委书记和工业部门负责人会议，号召各单位各部门紧急动员起来，力争上游，超额完成国家钢的生产计划。
    市委分析了当前的生产情况：关键在于原材料，而原材料的关键又在于设备。因此，市委要求各方全力以赴，钢铁、机械齐升帐。机械方面首先是要满足冶金设备的需要，如电动机、鼓风机等。关于钢的生产，提出了具体任务和措施。除了天津钢厂、新兴钢厂必须坚决完成国家计划指标外，要求天津钢厂新建部分把原来计划在明年第一季度末投入生产的三座转炉提前到今年9月25日投入生产，并再建五个转炉。为使这些措施得以实现，市委要求各有关单位和部门以战斗姿态立刻行动起来，发扬共产主义的协作精神，为超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
    会上，天津钢厂和新兴钢厂都保证超额完成计划；建筑安装部门保证提前完成新厂的建筑安装任务。机电工业局保证完成8月份七百五十台、9月份六百七十台鼓风机的生产任务。（附图片）
