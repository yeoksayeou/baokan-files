Dollars Can't Subdue the Arab People Either
　　Liang Shu

　　While the United States is engaging in aggression, pointing its bayonets at the Arab people, Eisenhower suddenly transformed himself into a "friend" of the Arab people at the UN emergency meeting on the 13th. He waved dollars, proposing a so-called "regional economic development plan aimed at helping and accelerating the improvement of the living standards of the people of Arab countries," and shamelessly boasted that his "plan" was to "realize the vision of a modernized Arab society" and "Arab goals." It actually believes that the lure of dollars can achieve the goals that military aggression cannot, and make the Arab people, who have already thwarted the US military aggression plan, succumb to the feet of US imperialism.

　　However, the people of the Middle East countries have already had enough experience with what US "aid" is. Eisenhower said that the United States "has always been happy to share its wealth with other countries" and that "in doing so, it does not seek to conquer or economically control others." But the opposite is true. It is not the Middle East people who have shared the wealth of the United States, but the US oil monopoly capital group that has become rich by plundering the oil wealth of the Middle East people. The US "aid" they take out of the huge oil profits is to conquer or economically control Middle East countries.

　　How much "aid" has the United States given to the Middle East region in the past? According to official US figures, the total amount of economic "aid" given by the United States to the Middle East region from the post-war period to 1957 was about 1.5 billion US dollars, while the amount of military aid has never been announced. But US "aid" is not a losing proposition. From 1956 to 1957 alone, it extracted 2.5 billion US dollars in profits from Near East countries. If calculated from the post-war period, what is the total profit of US plundering of Middle East oil? In the ten years from 1946 to 1956, US, British and other oil companies extracted a total of 585 million tons of oil in Middle East countries, earning nearly 8 billion US dollars in profits, of which two-thirds of the profits were divided by five US oil companies.

　　In recent years, in order to suppress the Middle East national independence movement, the United States has gradually shifted the focus of "aid" to the Middle East region, with the proportion of appropriations rising from 16% in 1950 to 27% in 1957.

　　After the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was put forward, US "aid" to the Middle East has greatly increased, with more than 170 million US dollars allocated in the first five months.

　　Most of the US "aid" to the Middle East is given to Turkey, and the rest is given to Iran, Israel and Jordan. The three countries of Turkey, Iran and Israel alone receive 85% of the total. The role of Turkey in the Middle East is well known. As a member of the Baghdad Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it is the most important US military base in the Middle East and a vanguard against Arab national independence. The US "aid" to Iran and Jordan was given after the nationalist Mossadegh government and Nabusi government were overthrown. In the short span of one month after the Mossadegh government, which nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, was overthrown, the United States gave nearly 100 million US dollars in "aid" in one go. After the Nabusi government was overthrown, the United States also provided Hussein with a steady stream of 130 million US dollars in "aid." Israel, an accomplice in the British and French aggression against Egypt, received a bounty of 256.7 million US dollars. That is to say, the object of the dollar is a small handful of loyal servants and accomplices of the United States.

　　The "aid" given by the United States to this small handful of reactionaries is by no means what Eisenhower called the United States "constantly expanding appropriations for foreign economic development." The US "foreign aid" funds are mostly used for military purposes. The nominal figures for US military "aid" to the Middle East are less than economic "aid," but most of the economic "aid" is also used for military purposes. The "Washington Post" published an article last year saying: it can be "fair" to say that "a large part of economic aid is also indirect military aid." This kind of "aid" brings to the puppet countries a heavy military burden and the bankruptcy of finance and economy.

　　Dulles and Secretary of Defense McElroy recently revealed some of the truths about "sharing American wealth" when persuading congressmen to agree to accept "foreign aid" appropriations. Dulles said: In the past eight years, countries that have received US aid have spent 122 billion US dollars on military expenditures because they have engaged in arms expansion and war preparation with the United States. McElroy calculated this account even more clearly, saying that "since 1950, allies who have received US military aid have spent five dollars (of their own money) for every dollar of such aid. They made even greater efforts in 1957, spending nearly seven dollars for every dollar of military aid."

　　Turkey is an example. "Fortune" magazine in the United States called Turkey the "experimental field" of US "aid." From 1947 to 1956, Turkey's military expenditure exceeded the total amount of US "aid" by more than one and a half times. The British "Daily Mirror" commented: "Turkey is close to bankruptcy because it supports a huge army of 500,000 infantry." Turkey's national debt has exceeded 4 billion lira, exceeding the entire budget for 1957. The number of currencies in circulation in 1957 was three and a half times that of 1950. What US "aid" has "cultivated" in the "experimental field" is: subordination to the United States, militarization of the country, inflation, increased taxes, and people living in misery.

　　In Iran, the evil consequences of US "aid" have also been very serious. The Iranian "New World" pointed out in an editorial commenting on US "aid" that US "aid" funds are used to build military roads, airports and barracks, while on the other hand, Iran cannot find funds to help Iranian villages economically. Due to military spending reaching 8 billion rials, the deficit in Iran's new fiscal year budget starting on March 22 will reach 10 billion rials. Iran's national industries have closed down one after another, of which the leather industry has closed down 40%. The lives of the Iranian people are becoming increasingly impoverished. This March, Iranian parliamentarian Imami said that some residents in southern Iran can only eat date pits to survive.

　　As for the Arab countries, how does the United States pursue "Arab goals" by playing the trick of "aid"? Eisenhower's "benevolence" is both "concerned" about their industrial and agricultural development and "concerned" about their water shortage and diseases. But let's see how the United States treats the issue of "aid" to Egypt. Egypt accepted an economic "aid" of 40 million US dollars from the United States in 1955, but because Egypt implemented a national independent policy that did not yield to imperialism, the United States actually reneged on the agreement signed by both parties and terminated "aid" after paying 18 million US dollars. The United States also said that it "is very concerned" about Egypt's water conservancy and repeatedly announced that it would help Egypt build the huge Aswan Dam, but the United States and the World Bank it controls put forward various harsh conditions to Egypt and delayed it in every way. When the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to unconditionally assist Egypt in building the dam, the United States immediately panicked and made a pile of promises for both loans and grants. However, when Egypt insisted on its national independent policy and continued to strengthen friendly relations with socialist countries, the United States suddenly withdrew all "aid" proposals in an insulting manner. US Senator Thayer once bluntly said: "If Egypt comes up with concrete evidence to show that it is on our side, I think the issue of funding the construction of the dam can be reopened after Congress reconvenes in January (1957)." As a result, Egypt did not exchange its independent sovereignty for US dollars, and the door of the US big boss has been closed all the time.

　　Not only that. When Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and refused to give the United States privileges, the United States' "charity" immediately turned into a ferocious pressure and boycott against Egypt. At that time, Dulles publicly stated that if Egypt did not "concede" on the canal issue, the United States would exert "economic pressure." Soon, the United States froze Egypt's 50 million US dollars in the United States. The United States also cracked down on Egypt's cotton exports in the international market. When Egypt had only a dozen days of wheat storage, the United States threatened Egypt to sell wheat only if it paid in US dollars. Now, US "aid" and economic boycotts have failed, and the American bayonets and the British bayonets that once inserted into Egypt are all pointing at the United Arab Republic.

　　Eisenhower is trying to cover the sky with one hand, making the Arab and Middle East people forget the above-mentioned painful lessons. He brazenly said: "Whether on the world map showing geographical conditions or economic conditions, no one can find that the power of American weapons or the strength of American wealth has annexed any foreign territory or political and economic systems." But, may I ask: What is the US extortion and economic sanctions against Egypt called? What is it called that the United States overthrew the Jordanian nationalist government in 1956, and when it failed to overthrow the Syrian government in 1957, it immediately instigated a military invasion of Syria? The establishment of US military bases on the territories of Turkey and Iran, and the control of the political and economic systems of Turkey and Iran by the United States, is this not a de facto annexation? The problem is that "the power of American weapons or the strength of American wealth" cannot realize the "annexation" plan everywhere. More and more national people heroically resist and smash this plan of the United States. The United Arab Republic is such a country. The revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people overthrew the "annexation" of US and British imperialism, and the Republic of Iraq stood up. The people of Lebanon and Jordan are also strongly criticizing and resisting the "annexation" of the US and British aggressors.

　　Eisenhower wants people to "believe my words: the dream of a big country dominating the world or the dream of world uniformity is an impossible dream." It is none other than the United States itself that has this dream and clings to it; but indeed, the US aggressors cannot but see that this is an impossible dream. Even US columnist Lippmann, who is loyal to the US ruling class, had to admit: "The era of American hegemony has become a fleeting stage in human affairs, and the fact that we have failed to adapt to this great fact of life and stubbornly cling to the illusion of American domination of the world is almost the undeniable reason for our repeated miscalculations in foreign policy." The era of American bayonets and dollars running rampant is gone forever. (Attached picture)

　　美元同样压服不了阿拉伯人民
　　梁恕
    当美国干着侵略的勾当，正在把刺刀指向阿拉伯人民的时候，艾森豪威尔13日在联大紧急会议上忽然摇身一变而为阿拉伯人民的“朋友”。他摇晃着美元，提出一个所谓“目的在于帮助和加速改善阿拉伯国家的人民的生活水平的区域性经济发展计划”，并且厚颜无耻地夸耀他的“计划”是为了“实现现代化阿拉伯社会的远景”和“阿拉伯目标”。它竟以为美元的诱惑能够达到它军事侵略所不能达到的目的，使已经挫败了美国军事侵略计划的阿拉伯人民屈服于美帝国主义的脚下。
    可是，中近东各国人民对美“援”是什么东西，早已有了足够的经验。艾森豪威尔说，美国“一直乐于同其他国家分享它的财富”，“这样作并不想征服或在经济上控制他人”。而事实恰恰相反。不是中近东人民分享了美国的财富，而是美国石油垄断资本集团从掠夺中近东人民的石油财富中发财致富。它们从巨额的石油利润中拿出的美“援”，又是为了征服或在经济上控制中近东国家。
    美国过去给了中近东地区多少“援助”呢？据美国官方数字，战后以来截至1957年止，美国给予中近东地区经济“援助”总共有十五亿美元左右，至于军援的数目则从未公布过。但是美国的“援助”并不赔本的。1956年到1957年期间就从近东国家榨取了二十五亿美元的利润。如果从战后以来计算，美国掠夺中近东石油的全部利润又有多少呢？从1946到1956的十年中，美英等国石油公司在中近东国家共开采了五亿八千五百万吨石油，获得近八十亿美元的利润，其中由五家美国石油公司分去的利润占三分之二。
    近年来美国为了镇压中近东民族独立运动，逐渐把“援助”的重点转移到中东地区，拨款份额由1950年的16％上升到1957年的27％。
  “艾森豪威尔主义”提出后，美国给中近东的“援助”更大为增加，头五个月就拨出了一亿七千多万美元。
    在美国给予中近东的“援助”中，大部分是给予土耳其，其余是给予伊朗、以色列和约旦。仅土、伊、以三国便得到总数的85％。土耳其在中东所起的作用是人所共知的，作为巴格达条约和北大西洋公约的成员国，它是美国在中东地区最重要的军事基地，同时又是反对阿拉伯民族独立的马前卒。而伊朗和约旦获得的美“援”，都是在民族主义的摩萨台政府和纳布西政府被颠覆之后。把英伊石油公司收归国有的摩萨台政府被颠覆后的短短一个多月之内，美国就一口气给了近一亿美元的“援助”。纳布西政府被推翻后，美国也源源地给予侯赛因一亿三千万美元的“援助”。作为英法侵略埃及帮凶的以色列，获得了数达二亿五千六百七十万美元的赏金。这就是说，美元的对象，是美国的一小撮忠实奴仆和帮凶。
    美国给予这一小撮反动派的“援助”，绝非艾森豪威尔所说的什么美国“一直在不断地扩大用于外国经济发展的拨款”。美国拨出的“援外”款项，绝大部分是用于军事用途。美国拨给中近东的军事“援助”，表面数字要比经济“援助”少，但经济“援助”的大部分也是用于军事方面。“华盛顿邮报”去年刊登一篇文章写道：可以
  “公正”的说，“经济援助中也有很大一部分作为间接的军事援助”。这种“援助”给仆从国家带来的，是沉重的军事负担和财政经济的破产。
    杜勒斯和国防部长麦克耳罗伊之流，最近在说服国会议员同意接受“援外”拨款时，道出了“分享美国财富”的一些真象。杜勒斯说：八年来接受美援的国家因为和美国一起进行扩军备战，军费支出达到一千二百二十亿美元。麦克耳罗伊把这笔账算得更加清楚，他说“自从1950年以来，接受美国军事援助的盟国每得一美元的这种援助就花了五美元（他们自己的钱）。它们在1957年作了更大程度的努力，每得一美元的军事援助差不多要花费七美元”。
    土耳其就是一个例子。美国“幸福”杂志把土耳其称为美“援”的“试验田”，从1947年到1956年土耳其的军费开支超过了美“援”总额的一倍半以上。英国“每日镜报”评论说：“土耳其已接近破产，因为它供养着一支五十万步兵的庞大军队”。土耳其的国债已超过四十亿里拉，超过了1957年度的全部预算。1957年流通的货币数字是1950年的三倍半。美“援”在“试验田”里“培植”的是：对美国的从属、国家的军事化、通货膨胀、赋税加重、民不聊生。
    在伊朗，美“援”的恶果，也已经十分严重。伊朗“新世界”在评论美“援”的社论中指出：美“援”款项被用来修筑军用公路、飞机场和兵营，而另一方面伊朗却找不到资金在经济上帮助伊朗乡村。由于军费达到八十亿里亚尔，从3月22日开始的伊朗新年度国家预算的赤字，将达到一百亿里亚尔。伊朗的民族工业纷纷倒闭，其中皮革工业已倒闭了40％。伊朗人民的生活日益贫困。今年3月伊朗议员伊马米说，伊朗南部的部分居民只能吃枣子核度日。
    至于对阿拉伯国家，美国玩弄“援助”的手法又是怎样地追求“阿拉伯的目标”的呢？艾森豪威尔的“仁慈”既是“关心”它们的工农业的发展，又是“关心”它们的水荒和疾病。但是，且看看美国怎样对待“援助”埃及的问题吧。埃及曾在1955年接受美国一笔四千万美元的经济“援助”，但是由于埃及执行了不向帝国主义屈膝的民族独立政策，美国竟背弃双方签字的协定，在付出一千八百万美元之后就中止“援助”了。美国又说什么它“十分关心”埃及的水利，一再宣布要帮助埃及修建巨大的阿斯旺水坝，但美国和它控制的世界银行向埃及提出了种种苛刻条件，多方拖延。当苏联表示愿意无条件地援助埃及修建水坝的时候，美国立刻慌张起来，又是贷款又是赠款，一堆允诺。但是，当埃及坚持民族独立政策，继续和社会主义国家加强友好关系时，美国突然以侮辱性的方式撤回了一切“援助”的建议。美国参议员泰伊曾经露骨地说：“如果埃及拿出实在的证据来表明它是和我们站在一边的，我认为这个资助水坝建设的问题在国会（1957年）1月复会后就可以重新打开”。结果，埃及并没有拿独立主权去换取美元，美国大老板的门也就一直关闭着。
    不仅如此。在埃及宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，拒绝给予美国特权的时候，美国的“慈善”，立即变成了对埃及的狰狞的压力和抵制。当时杜勒斯竟公开表示，如果埃及在运河问题上不“让步”的话，美国就要施加“经济压力”。不久，美国便冻结了埃及在美国的五千万美元。美国还在国际市场上打击埃及的棉花出口。当埃及只有十几天的小麦储存时，美国要挟埃及要以美元付款才能出售小麦。现在，美“援”、经济抵制都失了效力，美国的刺刀和曾经插入埃及的英国刺刀，一起向阿拉伯联合共和国亮起来了。
    艾森豪威尔妄想一手遮天，使阿拉伯和中近东人民忘掉上述的惨痛的教训。他大言不惭地说：“不论是在表明地理状况还是表明经济状况的世界地图上，谁也不能发见美国武器的威力或者美国财富的力量已经并吞了任何外国领土或者政治、经济体系”。但是，试问：美国对埃及的敲诈勒索和经济制裁，这叫作什么？美国在1956年颠覆了约旦民族主义政府，1957年颠覆叙利亚政府不成，立即策动军事侵略叙利亚的阴谋，这又叫作什么？在土耳其和伊朗的领土上建立了美国军事基地，土耳其和伊朗的政治和经济体系受到美国的控制，这难道不是实际上的并吞吗？问题是，“美国的武器的威力或者美国财富的力量”，并不是到处都能实现“并吞”的计划。越来越多的国家人民英勇地反抗和粉碎美国这个计划。阿拉伯联合共和国就是这样的一个国家。伊拉克人民的革命胜利，推翻了美英帝国主义的“并吞”，伊拉克共和国站起来了。黎巴嫩、约旦人民也在强烈地抨击和反抗美英侵略军的“并吞”。
    艾森豪威尔要人们“相信我的话：由一个大国独霸世界的梦想或世界一律的梦想是不可能实现的梦想”。有这个梦想，而且死死抱住这个梦想的，不是别人，而正是美国自己；但的确，美国侵略者不能不看到，这是不可能实现的梦想。忠于美国统治阶级的美国专栏作家李普曼也不得不承认：“美国霸权时期已成了人类事业中昙花一现的阶段，我们没能适应这个伟大的生活事实而死拖住美国称霸天下的幻想，这个事实几乎是我们在外交政策方面屡次失算的无可争辩的原因”。美国的刺刀和美元横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。（附图片）
