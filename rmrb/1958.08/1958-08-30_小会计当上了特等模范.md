　　Young Accountant Becomes Special-Class Model

　　Recently, a fourteen-year-old accountant in Xishui County, Hubei Province, was named a special-class model of the county. He is Mao Zhixian from Xiaoling Cooperative in Sanxi Township.

　　Mao Zhixian was only eleven years old when he started working as a cashier and accountant in the agricultural cooperative. Because he wasn't tall enough to reach the table, the cooperative specially made a high stool for him to work on. People called him "Little Accountant."

　　After becoming a cashier and accountant, Mao Zhixian humbly learned from the chief accountant Mao Youzhang, diligently studied, and made sure there were no mistakes in the daily accounts and cash.

　　Just as the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, the cooperative committee decided to advance some money to the members for the festival. That afternoon, the office was crowded with members eager to collect their money. He calmly opened the ledger and cash, and then announced to everyone: "Slow down, I'll call your name, and you can come to collect." He deftly counted the bills and fluently worked the abacus, calculating the amount each household should receive with perfect accuracy. Everyone was stunned and praised him in unison, saying: "True talent isn't limited by age, the little accountant is really capable!" The money for more than 150 households wasn't finished disbursing until the sun went down. After carefully counting the bills and confirming that there wasn't a penny's difference, he breathed a sigh of relief and happily went home for dinner.

　　Over the years, Mao Zhixian has not only been active and enthusiastic in his work, but has also made no mistakes for three years. Therefore, he was awarded the title of special-class model accountant at the county's agricultural cooperative accounting conference.

　　小会计当上了特等模范
    最近湖北浠水县有一个十四岁的小会计当上了县的特等模范。他就是三溪乡小岭社的毛志贤。
    毛志贤十一岁就在农业社担任出纳会计。他的个子还没有桌子高，社里特为他做了个高凳子办公。人们都称他为“小会计”。
    毛志贤担任出纳会计后，就虚心跟主办会计毛有章学习，认真钻研，不让每天的账目、现金出一点差错。
    正当端午快到来的时候，社委会决定预支一部分钱给社员过端午节。这天下午，办公室里挤满了领钱的社员，大家都争着先领款。他从容地摊开账册、现金，然后向大家一招呼：“慢来，喊谁的名子，谁就来领。”他灵巧地数着票子，流利地拨着算盘，每户应领的钱算得一清二楚。大家一时看得怔住了，齐声称赞说：“真是有志不在年高，小会计真能干！”一百五十多户的款子直到太阳落山才发完。他仔细清点了一下票子，没错一文钱。松了口气以后，他才觉得肚子饿得慌，于是高兴地回去吃晚饭。
    几年来，毛志贤不但工作积极、热情，而且三年未出过差错。所以这次在全县农业社会计会议上被评为特等模范会计。
