Xinhua News Agency, August 19th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session continued its discussion on the situation in the Middle East, caused by the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan, on August 18th.

　　The Romanian Foreign Minister said:
　　U.S. and British Armed Intervention Undermines the UN Charter
    The head of the Romanian delegation, Foreign Minister Corneliu Mănescu, expressed support in his speech for the proposal made by the Soviet Union to the General Assembly. He pointed out that, in order to ease the tense situation in the Middle East, the Assembly should first focus its attention on the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.
    Mănescu said that the presence of United States and British armed forces in Lebanon and Jordan threatened peace and security in the Middle East and blatantly violated the United Nations Charter. It is quite difficult to discuss economic development plans for Arab countries under these circumstances. He said that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan would be the primary and most urgent measure to maintain peace in the Middle East.

　　The Indian Representative said:
　　All Excuses for US and British Aggression are Untenable
    Indian representative Mr. Lall focused his speech on the Arab national independence movement, condemning the attempts of the United States and Britain to stifle the national aspirations of the Arabs. Mr. Lall welcomed the Iraqi revolution and the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, and refuted the slanderous claim by the US and British ruling circles that this revolution was an "act of terror." Mr. Lall emphasized that the people of Lebanon and Jordan should be allowed to solve their own future problems without any external interference, and that no excuse can justify such intervention.
    Mr. Lall said that India was extremely disturbed by the landing of American troops and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan. He believes that the aggressors' use of the United Nations Charter and so-called "invitations" as excuses for armed intervention in other countries is untenable. He said that for the Middle East issue, the most pressing, important and urgent requirement at present is to resolve the current serious danger in the Middle East region—the issue of foreign troops. He said that the presence of foreign troops in the Middle East poses a danger that any slight incident could develop into a large-scale destructive war. He said that India hopes that the United States will withdraw its troops from Lebanon and Britain will withdraw its troops from Jordan. India will support any reasonable plan to achieve this goal.
    The Indian representative strongly opposed the idea of ​​replacing the US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan with UN troops.

　　The Argentine Representative said:
　　To Solve the Middle East Issue, Colonialism Must be Eliminated
    Argentine representative Mr. Hurtado expressed opposition to interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries in his speech. He said that for the Middle East issue, "it is impossible to seek a solution without recognizing the right of all peoples to establish and unite their countries, to eliminate all forms of colonialism and political, economic and military subordination... The right of all peoples to decide their own destiny without foreign interference—whether direct or indirect—is the cornerstone of international law and peace."
    The Argentine representative advocated that all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful means, with the help of the United Nations and other international organizations. If the right of all peoples to decide their own destiny (which also includes their right to unite) is not recognized, it is inconceivable to mediate the situation in the Near East.

　　The Greek Representative said:
　　Arabs Should Oppose Colonialist Remnants
    Mr. Palamas, the representative of the Greek government, which has sharp contradictions with Britain on the Cyprus issue, said in his speech that the actions of the Arabs in opposing the remnants of colonialism are justified.
    He said that the Soviet proposal "contains beneficial factors" and expressed the hope that the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly will stipulate that all foreign troops withdraw from the territories of Middle Eastern countries as soon as possible.
    Jordanian representative Mr. Rifai said that his government considered the presence of British troops in Jordan only a "temporary measure." But he did not mention the date of the British troop withdrawal from Jordan at all, but only stated that after the United Nations passes a "appropriate" resolution, the Jordanian government will request Britain to withdraw its troops.

　　The Iraqi Foreign Minister said:
　　The Landing of US and British Troops in the Middle East Threatens World Peace
    The afternoon meeting listened very carefully to the speech of Mr. Jamal, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq.
    He said that the General Assembly is now discussing the dangerous situation in the Middle East that threatens peace. The Iraqi delegation firmly believes that the dangerous situation in this region is caused by two reasons: The first reason is the policies of certain countries known for their colonialist traditions. Due to the continuous pressure exerted by these major powers on certain countries in the Arab world, the regimes in these countries have fallen into the hands of governments composed of their servants, who implement rule by force, using methods and pursuing goals that are not in line with the interests of their people. This inevitably leads to just popular revolutions, as happened in Iraq.
    He emphasized that this situation also exists in some other Arab countries, where the gap between the people and the puppet governments riding on their heads is growing wider and wider.
    Mr. Jamal said that the second obvious reason for the exacerbation of the tense situation in the Middle East is the landing of American troops in Lebanon and British troops in Jordan. He said: The government of the Republic of Iraq believes that the landing of foreign troops in these two countries not only threatens the security of Iraq, but also threatens world peace.
    He continued that the Iraqi delegation believes that it has a responsibility to state without reservation that the armed forces of the United States and Britain should withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan in order to restore the normal political life of this region.

　　The Albanian Foreign Minister said:
　　The Seven-Nation Proposal Does Not Help Solve the Problem
    Albanian Foreign Minister Mr. Shtulla reminded the delegates to the General Assembly that more than a month has passed since the US and British armed forces invaded Lebanon and Jordan, pushing the world to the brink of a third world war, but the United Nations has not yet taken measures to eliminate the consequences of the aggression.
    Mr. Shtulla then refuted the claim of so-called "indirect aggression" by the United Arab Republic. He pointed out that the facts show that what happened in the Middle East was direct aggression by the United States and Britain against two small Arab countries, and hostile propaganda and activities against countries striving for national liberation.
    Mr. Shtulla also talked about the proposal put forward by the delegations of seven countries, including Norway. He pointed out that the drafters of this proposal are either linked to the United States through the North Atlantic Group or are economically dependent on the United States. He said: This proposal cannot help solve the problem under discussion, because it does not mention the withdrawal of the invading troops at all. Therefore, this proposal is unacceptable to Albania. Albania supports the Soviet proposal.

　　The Indonesian Representative said:
　　The United States Can Only Talk About Other Matters After Withdrawing Its Troops First
    Indonesian representative Mr. Sastroamidjojo pointed out that in recent years some significant events have occurred in the Arab East, which are part of the formation process of true Arab consciousness. He said that it is very clear that all attempts to stifle and obstruct the revival of the national movements of the Asian and African peoples have failed.
    When talking about the "plan" put forward by Eisenhower at this conference, Mr. Sastroamidjojo said that before discussing economic aid to the people of the Arab East, it is necessary to first resolve the fundamental and primary issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He said that as long as these troops withdraw, the issue of economic development of Middle Eastern countries can be fully discussed at the next regular session of the General Assembly.
    He emphasized that the continued presence of US and British troops in these two Arab countries poses a constant threat of armed conflict. He said that the current situation in the Middle East requires strict implementation of Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter, which requires all countries to "refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."

　　The Afghan Representative said:
　　The General Assembly Must Pass a Resolution Ordering the US and Britain to Withdraw Troops
    Afghan representative Mr. Pazhwak expressed concern about the situation in the Middle East. He called on the General Assembly to take resolute and swift measures to eliminate the danger caused in the region by the presence of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan. Mr. Pazhwak pointed out that a resolution on the "earliest possible" withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan must be passed. He emphasized that in this regard, the Soviet proposal should be "studied with particular care." He called on the representatives of small countries in the General Assembly to "consider their own responsibilities for maintaining peace and security throughout the world." He pointed out that any resolution passed by the General Assembly that cannot be accepted by the Arab countries will be invalid.
    Representatives from Spain and Italy also spoke in the afternoon.

    联大紧急特别会议继续举行
    美英侵略者受到围攻
    各国代表众口一词要求两国立即从中东撤军
    据新华社19日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会紧急特别会议18日的会议继续讨论由于美国和英国武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦所造成的中近东局势问题。
　　罗马尼亚外长说：
　　美英武装干涉破坏联合国宪章
    罗马尼亚代表团团长、外交部长布纳丘在发言中表示支持苏联向大会提出的提案，他指出，为了缓和中近东的紧张局势，大会首先应当把注意力集中在美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题上。
    布纳丘说，美国和英国武装部队驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦威胁着中近东的和平和安全，粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章。在这种情况下来讨论阿拉伯国家的经济发展计划，是相当困难的。他说，外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦将是维护中近东和平的首要的、最紧急的措施。
　　印度代表说：
　  美英侵略的一切借口都站不住脚
    印度代表拉尔在发言中着重谈到阿拉伯的民族独立运动，他谴责美英两国企图窒息阿拉伯的民族愿望。拉尔欢迎伊拉克的革命和伊拉克共和国的成立，并且驳斥了美英统治集团诬蔑这个革命为“恐怖行动”的说法。拉尔强调说，黎巴嫩和约旦两国人民应当不受任何外来的干涉来自己解决自己的前途问题，任何借口都不能为这种干涉辩解。
    拉尔说，印度对美国军队和英国军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆极为不安。他认为侵略者以联合国宪章和所谓“邀请”等等作为武装干涉他国的借口，是站不住脚的。他说，对于中东问题，目前最迫切、最重要和最紧急的要求是解决中东地区目前的严重危险——外国军队问题。他说，外国军队留在中近东会造成这样一种危险，即任何一点点意外事件都可能发展成为大规模的毁灭性战争。他说，印度希望美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队撤出约旦。印度将支持为了达到这个目的的任何合理计划。
    印度代表强烈反对用联合国军队代替在黎巴嫩和约旦的美英军队的主张。
　　阿根廷代表说：
　　要解决中东问题必须消灭殖民主义
    阿根廷代表乌尔塔多在发言时表示反对干涉中东国家的内部事务。他说，对于中东问题，“要是不承认各国人民成立和统一他们的国家、消灭一切形式的殖民主义和政治经济及军事上的附属地位的权利，就不可能求得解决办法……各国人民在不受外国干涉——不论直接或者间接——的情况下决定自己的命运的权利是国际法和和平的基石。”
    阿根廷代表主张一切国际争端应当通过和平方法，在联合国和其他国际组织的帮助下求得解决。如果不承认各国人民决定他们切身命运的权利（其中也包括他们联合的权利），调解近东局势是不可思议的。
　　希腊代表说：
　  阿拉伯人应该反对殖民主义残余
    在塞浦路斯问题上同英国有尖锐矛盾的希腊政府的代表帕拉马斯在发言中说，阿拉伯人反对殖民主义残余的行动是正当的。
    他说，苏联的提案“包含着有益的因素”，并且表示希望，联合国大会采取的决议将规定一切外国军队尽速撤离中近东国家领土。
    约旦代表里法伊说，他的政府认为英国军队驻扎在约旦只是“暂时的措施”。但是他一点也没有谈到英国军队撤出约旦的日期，而只是表示，在联合国通过“适当的”决议之后，约旦政府将请求英国撤军。
　　伊拉克外长说：
　  美英军队登陆中东威胁世界和平
    下午的会议十分注意地听取了伊拉克共和国外交部长贾迈尔的发言。
    他说，大会现在正在讨论在中东形成的威胁和平的危险局势。伊拉克代表团坚决相信，这个地区的危险局势是由两个原因造成的：第一个原因是，以殖民主义传统闻名的某些国家的政策。由于这些大国不断地对阿拉伯世界某些国家施加压力，这些国家的政权落入了由它们的仆从组成的政府之手，实行武力统治，所使用的办法和追求的目的都是与他们的人民的利益不符合的。这就必然导致正义的人民革命，正如在伊拉克所发生的情况一样。
    他着重说，现在某些其他阿拉伯国家也存在着这种情况，在这些国家里，人民同骑在他们头上的傀儡政府之间的鸿沟越来越深了。
    贾迈尔说，使得中东紧张局势尖锐化的第二个明显的原因就是美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆和英国军队在约旦登陆。他说：伊拉克共和国政府认为，外国军队在这两个国家登陆不仅威胁着伊拉克的安全，而且也威胁着世界和平。
    他接着说，伊拉克代表团认为，它有责任无保留地声明，美国和英国的武装部队应当撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，以便恢复这个地区的正常的政治生活。
　　阿尔巴尼亚外长说：
    七国提案无助于解决问题
    阿尔巴尼亚外交部长什图拉提醒大会代表说，从美英武装部队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦因而把世界推到了第三次世界大战的边缘到现在已经一个多月了，但是，联合国一直还没有采取消除侵略后果的措施。
    什图拉然后驳斥了关于阿拉伯联合共和国进行所谓“间接侵略”的说法。他指出，事实表明，在中东所发生的事情是，美国和英国对两个阿拉伯小国进行直接侵略，并且对争取民族解放的国家进行敌对的宣传和活动。
    什图拉还谈到了挪威等七个国家代表团提出的提案。他指出，这项提案的起草人不是通过北大西洋集团同美国有着联系，就是在经济上依赖于美国。他说：这项提案不能有助于解决所讨论的问题，因为其中根本没有谈到撤出侵略军的问题，因此，这项提案是阿尔巴尼亚所不能接受的。阿尔巴尼亚支持苏联的提案。
　　印度尼西亚代表说：
　  美国只有先撤退军队才能谈其他
    印度尼西亚代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，在最近几年里阿拉伯东方发生了一些意义重大的事件，这些事件是阿拉伯真正觉悟的形成过程的一部分。他说，十分清楚，一切想要扼杀和阻挡亚非人民民族运动复兴的企图都破产了。
    在谈到艾森豪威尔在这次大会上所提出的“计划”时，沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，在讨论对阿拉伯东方人民的经济援助以前，必须先解决关于外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦这个基本的和首要的问题。他说，只要这些军队撤退，在联大下次例会上就完全可以讨论关于中近东国家经济发展的问题。
    他强调说，美英军队继续留驻在这两个阿拉伯国家造成了武装冲突的经常性的威胁。他说，目前中东的局势要求严格实现联合国宪章第二条第四款，这一款要求一切国家“在其国际关系上不得以武力相威胁或使用武力，侵害任何国家的领土完整和政治独立”。
　　阿富汗代表说：
　  大会必须通过令美英撤军的决议
    阿富汗代表佩吉瓦克对中东的局势表示不安。他要求大会采取坚决而迅速的措施来消除由于美英军队驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦而在这个地区造成的危险。佩吉瓦克指出，必须通过一项关于外国军队“尽早”撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议。他强调，在这方面，应当对苏联的提案“进行特别仔细的研究”。他呼吁大会上的小国代表“考虑一下自己对维护全世界和平和安全的责任”。他指出，大会所通过的任何决议如果不能为阿拉伯国家接受，都将是无效的。
    在下午发言的还有西班牙和意大利的代表。
