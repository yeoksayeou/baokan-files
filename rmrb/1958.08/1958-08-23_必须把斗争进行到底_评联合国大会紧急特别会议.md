　　The Struggle Must Be Carried Through to the End
　　--Commentary on the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session
　　The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session unanimously adopted the proposal of ten Arab countries on the 21st and adjourned after the adoption of this proposal. According to the resolution made based on the proposal of the Arab countries, the Secretary-General of the United Nations is instructed to "immediately make practical arrangements to fully help maintain the purposes and principles of the (United Nations) Charter in the current situation on the issues of Lebanon and Jordan, thereby facilitating the early withdrawal of foreign troops from these two countries"; the resolution also requires the Secretary-General to submit the first report on the implementation of the resolution no later than September 30. This cannot but be a serious blow to the US-British aggressors. Because from the very beginning of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session, they tried to legitimize their aggression, continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, and conspired to organize "United Nations Peace Force" to continue to ravage the independence and sovereignty of these two countries. This plan has completely failed. The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session stipulated the early withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, reflecting the universal demands of the people of all countries.
　　The voice of striving for peace and safeguarding the right to national independence occupied an overwhelming advantage at this UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session. Representatives of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, as well as representatives of many Asian and African national independent countries, sternly denounced the aggressive acts of the United States and Britain, and refuted all their excuses for aggression in the Middle East. Indian representative Lall pointed out that the US and Britain's use of the UN Charter and the so-called "invitation" as excuses for armed intervention is untenable. Moroccan representative Filali said that the Moroccan government believes that the United States and Britain's dispatch of troops to Lebanon and Jordan is "completely unjustified..., and the reasons are all fabricated." Ceylon representative Corea pointed out that no article of the United Nations Charter can prove that US and British intervention in the Near East is justified. Representatives of most countries who spoke at the meeting pointed out that the US and British aggression threatened the peace of the Middle East and the world, and demanded that the US and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Representatives from the following countries spoke at the meeting demanding the withdrawal of US and British troops: the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, Czechoslovakia, Saudi Arabia, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Iraq, Albania, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Poland, Burma, Morocco, Ukraine, Ceylon, Yemen, Belarus, Malaya, Yugoslavia, Sudan, and other countries. Even Greece, a member of the North Atlantic Group, expressed its hope that the United States and Britain would withdraw their troops; and the Japanese representative, who tried his best to run errands for the United States and Britain, had to admit that the long-term presence of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan "may cause adverse consequences." The demand to respect Arab nationalism and the right of the people of all countries to decide their own destiny without foreign interference is an unanimous call of the vast majority of countries (including some Latin American countries such as Argentina and Peru). There is no doubt that the demands of representatives of various countries for the withdrawal of US and British troops and respect for the right to national independence are in line with the most universal and urgent aspirations of the people of all countries at present.
　　From the very beginning, the US-British aggressors attempted to play political conspiracies at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session to divert people's urgent demands for US-British troop withdrawal, and attempted to use the banner of the United Nations to continue aggression. US President Eisenhower personally delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session that included a six-point plan. This speech put forward many conditions for the US and Britain to withdraw their troops from the Middle East, as a shield for their refusal to withdraw their troops. At the same time, in this speech, Eisenhower also demanded the establishment of a "United Nations Peace Force" as an aggressive tool for the US and Britain, and also demanded the formulation of a so-called "regional economic development plan" to promote the economic development of Arab countries, attempting to confuse people. The US-British aggressors originally expected that Eisenhower's speech could stop the wave of people of all countries demanding the withdrawal of US and British troops, and set a tone for the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session. However, as soon as this speech came out, it was strongly opposed by the public opinion of Arab countries and other Asian and African countries. Public opinion in many countries sharply pointed out that Eisenhower's six-point plan was a reprint and expansion of the already bankrupt Eisenhower Doctrine. Even the mouthpiece of the US ruling group, the "New York Times," in a commentary published on August 19, had to admit that the reaction to Eisenhower's plan in the Arab world was "from indifferent to hostile." Eisenhower's speech did not receive the support inside and outside the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session that could reassure the aggressors. The US-British aggressors then created a vague "seven-nation proposal" that was actually a replica of Eisenhower's six-point plan. However, the fate of this "seven-nation proposal," which appeared in the guise of a "middle road," was not much better than the fate of Eisenhower's six-point plan. Socialist countries, Arab countries and many other Asian and African countries have expressed that they can never accept any plan that does not stipulate the withdrawal of US and British troops, and they also firmly oppose the conspiracy to establish a so-called "United Nations Peace Force" to suppress the national liberation movement of all countries.
　　The failure of Eisenhower's six-point plan and the "seven-nation proposal" shows that the US-British aggressors have fallen into an unprecedentedly isolated position in the United Nations. The US State Department has always regarded the United Nations as its subsidiary, and has used the banner of the United Nations to carry out the war of aggression against Korea. However, now, whether the US President personally comes forward, or directs some countries to pretend to be "peacemakers," cannot change the embarrassing situation of the US-British aggressors at this UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session. It has only been five years from the Korean armistice to the US-British collusion to invade the Middle East. However, the US voting machine in the United Nations has become greatly ineffective. This change in the United Nations is a clear proof that the US policy of aggression is becoming increasingly unworkable, and it is also another reflection of the development of the international situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind.
　　The proposal of ten Arab countries mentioned that the US and British troops should withdraw from the Middle East as soon as possible, which is in line with the urgent demands of the people of all countries reflected at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session. Although this proposal, as Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko pointed out, still has some shortcomings in its wording, because it said what the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session had to say, socialist countries and other Asian and African countries expressed their support for this proposal. The US-British aggressors, in the face of repeated setbacks in their die-hard stance of refusing to withdraw their troops, and after Dulles hurriedly ran back to Washington to secretly consult with Eisenhower, had to accept this proposal.
　　However, the US aggressors, when expressing their acceptance of the proposal of the Arab countries, had already begun to distort the essence of this proposal in their own language. US Secretary of State Dulles, in his speech when voting on the proposal of the Arab countries on the 21st, still emphasized the US advocacy of the vague wording of the "seven-nation proposal" on the issue of troop withdrawal, and expressed that he understood the proposal of the Arab countries according to the meaning of the seven-nation proposal. This exposed the conspiracy of the US aggressors to continue to play the trick of delaying the withdrawal of troops.
　　Everyone knows that the tension in the Middle East situation is due to the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by the troops of the United States and Britain, and the preparation to expand the war of aggression in the Middle East. To eliminate the tension in the Middle East situation and consolidate world peace, the prerequisite is the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan; as long as the US and British aggressor troops have not withdrawn, the Middle East problem will not be solved for a day, and the tension will not be eliminated for a day. Whether the resolution unanimously adopted by the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session can truly help ease the tension in the Middle East situation depends on whether the US and British troops can withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible.
　　Although the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session has adjourned, the US and British troops are still entrenched in Lebanon and Jordan, and the US troops invading Lebanon are building extensively there and negotiating with the Lebanese government to establish military bases. Therefore, anyone with a clear mind should remember what Dulles said: "No proposal, in itself, will solve the Near East problem. These problems have deep roots. These problems cannot be easily eradicated. These problems have aspects that can erupt unexpectedly at any time. No resolution of the General Assembly can solve these problems in itself, and it would be foolish if we leave here believing that the Near East problem has been solved by passing this proposal." Dulles has already created excuses in advance for the US and Britain to delay the withdrawal of troops, and has set up heavy reefs for the UN Secretary-General to arrange the withdrawal of troops. Therefore, the people of Arab countries and all peace-loving people in the world must not relax their fighting will in the slightest, must maintain a high degree of vigilance, and persist in the struggle until the US and British aggressor troops completely withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan!

　　必须把斗争进行到底
　　——评联合国大会紧急特别会议
    联合国大会紧急特别会议已于21日一致通过十个阿拉伯国家的提案，并在这个提案通过后宣布休会。根据阿拉伯国家的提案作出的决议，责成联合国秘书长“立即作出实际安排以便在目前情况下在黎巴嫩和约旦的问题上，充分帮助维护（联合国）宪章的宗旨和原则，从而便于外国军队早日撤出这两个国家”；决议还要求秘书长不得迟于9月30日提出执行决议的第一个报告。这对于美英侵略者来说不能不是一个严重的打击。因为它们从联大紧急特别会议一开始，就力图使它们的侵略罪行合法化，继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，并且阴谋组织“联合国和平部队”来继续蹂躏这两个国家的独立和主权。这种打算是完全失败了。联合国大会紧急特别会议的决议规定美英军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，反映了各国人民的普遍要求。
    争取和平和维护民族独立权利的声音，在这次联大紧急特别会议上占了压倒的优势。苏联和所有社会主义国家的代表，以及许多亚非民族独立国家的代表，都严正地斥责了美英的侵略行为，并驳斥了它们的侵略中东的一切借口。印度代表拉尔指出，美英以联合国宪章和所谓“邀请”作为武装干涉的借口，是站不住脚的。摩洛哥代表菲拉利说，摩洛哥政府认为，美国和英国出兵黎巴嫩和约旦是“完全没有正当的理由的……，其理由都是杜撰的。”锡兰代表科里亚指出，联合国宪章的任何一条都不能证明美英干涉近东是正当的。在会议上发言的大多数国家的代表都指出，美英的侵略行为威胁着中东和世界的和平，并要求美英把它们的军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出。有代表在会上发言要求美英撤军的国家有：苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、沙特阿拉伯、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、印度、伊拉克、阿尔巴尼亚、印度尼西亚、阿富汗、波兰、缅甸、摩洛哥、乌克兰、锡兰、也门、白俄罗斯、马来亚、南斯拉夫、苏丹等国。甚至，北大西洋集团成员国家希腊也表示希望美英撤军；而竭力为美英奔走的日本代表也不能不承认，美英军队长期留驻在黎巴嫩和约旦“可能引起不良的后果”。要求尊重阿拉伯民族主义和各国人民在不受外国的干涉下决定他们自己的命运的权利，更是绝大多数国家（包括拉丁美洲一些国家如阿根廷和秘鲁）的一致的呼声。毫无疑问，各国代表要求美英撤军和尊重民族独立权利的主张，是符合于各国人民当前最普遍和最迫切的愿望的。
    美英侵略者从一开始，就企图在联大紧急特别会议上玩弄政治阴谋，来转移人们对美英撤军的迫切要求，并且企图利用联合国的旗子继续进行侵略。美国总统艾森豪威尔亲自到联大紧急特别会议上发表了一篇包括六点计划的演说。这篇演说提出了美英从中东撤军的许多条件，作为它们拒绝撤军的盾牌。同时，在这个演说中，艾森豪威尔还要求建立一支“联合国和平部队”作为美英的侵略工具，并且还要求制定一个所谓促进阿拉伯国家经济发展的“区域性经济发展计划”，企图迷惑人心。美英侵略者原来期望，艾森豪威尔的这篇演说能够阻挡住各国人民要求美英撤军的浪潮，并为联大紧急特别会议定下一个基调。可是，这篇演说刚一出笼，就遭到了阿拉伯国家和其他亚非国家舆论的强烈反对。许多国家的舆论尖锐地指出，艾森豪威尔的六点计划是早已破了产的艾森豪威尔主义的再版和扩大。连美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约时报”在8月19日发表的述评中，也不能不承认艾森豪威尔的计划在阿拉伯世界中所得到的反应是“从冷淡直到敌视”。艾森豪威尔的演说，在联大紧急特别会议内外都没有得到使侵略者可以安心的支持。美英侵略者于是制造了一个含糊其词而实际上是艾森豪威尔六点计划的翻版的“七国提案”。可是，这个以“中间的道路”的面目出现的“七国提案”的下场，比艾森豪威尔六点计划的命运好不了多少。社会主义国家、阿拉伯国家和其他许多亚非国家都表示绝不能接受没有规定美英撤军的任何方案，并且也坚决反对建立所谓“联合国和平部队”来镇压各国人民民族解放运动的诡计。
    艾森豪威尔的六点计划和“七国提案”的失败，说明了美英侵略者在联合国已经陷于空前孤立的地位。美国国务院一贯地把联合国看作是它的附属机构，并曾打着联合国的旗子进行过侵略朝鲜的战争。可是，现在不论是美国总统亲自出马也好，还是指使一些国家装作“和事佬”出面也好，都不能改变美英侵略者这次在联大紧急特别会议上的狼狈处境。从朝鲜停战到美英勾结侵略中东，才不过五年的光景。但是，美国在联合国的表决机器已经大大地不灵了。联合国的这种变化，是美国侵略政策已日益行不通的明证，也是东风压倒西风的国际局势发展中的又一个反映。
    阿拉伯十个国家的提案提到了美英军队要早日撤出中东，这是符合于联大紧急特别会议上所反映出来的自各国人民的迫切要求的。尽管这个提案如苏联外长葛罗米柯指出的在提法上还有某些不足，可是由于它说了联大紧急特别会议所必须说的话，所以社会主义国家和其他亚非国家表示支持这个提案。美英侵略者在它们拒绝撤军的死硬立场一再碰壁的情况下，在杜勒斯急急忙忙跑回华盛顿同艾森豪威尔密商之后，也只好接受这个提案。
    但是，美国侵略者就在表示接受阿拉伯国家提案的时候，已开始用他们自己的语言来歪曲这个提案的实质。美国国务卿杜勒斯在21日表决阿拉伯国家提案时的发言中仍然强调美国主张“七国提案”关于撤军问题的含糊其词的提法，并且表示他是按七国提案的意思来理解阿拉伯国家提案的。这就暴露了美国侵略者企图继续玩弄拖延撤军的阴谋。
    谁都知道，中东局势的紧张，就是由于美英两国的军队侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦，并准备扩大侵略中东的战争。要消除中东的紧张局势和巩固世界和平，先决条件就是美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦；只要美英侵略军队一天没有撤走，中东问题就一天没有解决，紧张局势一天不能消除。联大紧急会议所一致通过的决议能否真正有助于缓和中东紧张局势，取决于美英军队是否能够早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    联大紧急特别会议虽则休会了，但是，美英军队依旧盘踞在黎巴嫩和约旦，侵黎美军并且在那里大兴土木，同黎巴嫩政府谈判建立军事基地。因之，任何头脑清醒的人，都应当记住杜勒斯所说的话：“任何提案，它本身是不会解决近东问题的。这些问题是有很深的根源的。这些问题是不能轻易根除的。这些问题具有随时能够出乎我们意料之外的一触即发的方面。大会任何决议的本身都不能解决这些问题，如果我们在离开这里的时候就相信通过这项提案就已经把近东问题解决了，那将是愚蠢的。”杜勒斯已经为美英拖延撤军预先制造了借口，为联合国秘书长安排撤军问题设下了重重的暗礁。因此，阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民，不能一丝一毫松懈斗争意志，必须保持高度的警惕，坚持斗争，直到美英侵略军完全撤出黎巴嫩和约旦为止！
