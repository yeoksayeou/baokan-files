    Working-Class True Colors
    Recently, the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Dalian Shipyard launched a competition to build 5,000-ton freighters. Some parts were made through mutual cooperation between the two factories. Of the four ball discs used in the two hydraulic steering gears manufactured by the Jiangnan Shipyard, only two were of the best quality. During assembly, some people suggested installing one of the best ball discs on each of the two machines, but more workers advocated using both of the best ones entirely on the machine manufactured for the Dalian Shipyard. Finally, everyone agreed to do so. Worker Xia Jiaxiang said, "We must not only compete in shipbuilding, but also compete in communist spirit."
    Such an ordinary thing, such an ordinary sentence, shines with such strong communist brilliance!

    工人阶级本色
    最近江南船厂和大连船厂开展建造五千吨海轮的竞赛，有些轮船部件两厂互相协作。江南厂制造的两部油压舵机用的四个弹子盘，只有两个质量最好。在装配时，有人提出把最好的弹子盘两部机器各装一只，但更多的工人主张将两只最好的全用在给大连船厂制造的机器上，最后一致同意这样办。工人夏家祥说：“我们不仅要比赛造船，还要比赛共产主义精神。”
    这样一件平常的事，这样一句平常的话，闪烁着多么强烈的共产主义光芒！
