    Inner Mongolia's First Oil Exploration Well Drilled
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 3rd August: The first oil exploration well in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Hangjin Banner Benchmark No. 1 Well, was recently started on the Ordos grassland. The appearance of this drilling well marks the transition of oil exploration in the northern part of the Ordos platform from surface surveys to a comprehensive exploration stage combining surface and subsurface methods.
    After several years of investigation and analysis by the Ordos Grassland Survey Team of the Inner Mongolia Geological Bureau, it is believed that the Hangjin Banner area is a promising oil-bearing area in terms of regional structure, sedimentary rock distribution, and oil and gas indications.

    内蒙古第一口石油探井开钻
    新华社呼和浩特3日电　内蒙古自治区第一口石油探井——杭锦旗基准一号井，最近在鄂尔多斯草原上开钻。这口钻井的出现，标志着鄂尔多斯地台北部的石油勘探工作，已从地面调查进入到地面与地下相结合的综合勘探阶段。
    经过内蒙古地质局鄂尔多斯草原普查大队几年来的调查分析和勘探，认为从区域构造、沉积岩分布、油气显示等方面，都说明了杭锦旗一带是一个很有希望的含油地区。
