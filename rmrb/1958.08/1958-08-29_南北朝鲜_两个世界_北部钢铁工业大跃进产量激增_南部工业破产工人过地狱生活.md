　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 26th: Our correspondent reports: The steel workers of North Korea, having mounted the Chollima horse, are simultaneously producing and constructing, innovating technology, and improving equipment, determined to exceed the highest historical record of steel production this year. They are also determined to complete the restoration of two blast furnaces before the end of October this year.

　　A leading cadre of the Korean Ministry of Metal Industry said that the pig iron production of the Korean steel industry, which suffered serious damage during the war, will exceed the highest annual output of 400,000 tons during the Japanese occupation period.

　　The production of steel and steel products in Korea is also developing at the same speed. At the beginning of this year, the workers of the steelmaking workshop of the Hwanghae Iron Works launched a campaign to refine a furnace of steel in eleven hours. After the blast furnace in this factory is put into production, three open-hearth furnaces can directly use molten iron to make steel, which will further speed up the steelmaking process. This year, the steel workers are determined to produce more than 230,000 tons of steel, an increase of 100,000 tons over last year.

　　Reconstructing and expanding equipment and innovating metallurgical technology are major features of the recovery and development of the Korean steel industry after the war. This year, Korean steel workers have made significant achievements in this area. The most notable example is that the mechanization level and output of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Hwanghae Iron Works, which was completely designed and constructed by the staff of the Korean metallurgical sector themselves, far exceed those of the past. In particular, since this blast furnace officially used iron coke to refine iron for the first time in the world in July this year, its output has greatly increased, from more than 460 tons per day in late June to the current 630 tons per day, and may continue to increase in the future.

　　At present, the basic construction of the Korean steel industry is progressing on an unprecedented scale. Various steel plants are carrying out large-scale construction, and various restoration and construction projects such as blast furnaces, coking furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling mills are advancing simultaneously, among which the Hwanghae and Kim Chaek Iron Works have the largest engineering scale. These two factories will be built into large-scale iron and steel complexes in the next few years.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th: Seoul dispatch: Due to the brutal oppression of the Syngman Rhee clique and South Korean comprador capitalists, South Korean workers are living a hellish life under the threat of death and disease.

　　Due to the lack of safety equipment in the various factories and mines, the phenomenon of casualties among South Korean workers is very serious. South Korean "Industrial Economic News" said that the six mines under the "Daehan Coal Corporation," a state-owned enterprise of the Syngman Rhee clique, had an average of more than ten casualties per day during a three-year period.

　　Since the beginning of this year, South Korea's industry has further collapsed. While capitalists are laying off workers in large numbers, they are also taking plunderous measures to extend the working hours of those who have not been laid off. According to estimates by South Korean news agencies, Syngman Rhee's state-owned enterprises have laid off more than 1,800 people since this spring. The Daegu factory of "Daehan Textile Company" laid off 60% of its workers at one time.

　　Due to poor working conditions and long working hours, the number of sick workers in South Korea is increasing day by day. Even a statistic from the South Korean authorities' Ministry of Health and Social Affairs had to admit that out of more than 53,000 workers, 11,000 had various diseases. The "Chosun Ilbo" said that more than one-third of the total number of workers in South Korea currently suffer from lung diseases or other chronic diseases.

### 南北朝鲜　两个世界  北部钢铁工业大跃进产量激增  南部工业破产工人过地狱生活

　　南北朝鲜　两个世界
    北部钢铁工业大跃进产量激增
    南部工业破产工人过地狱生活
    据新华社平壤26日电　本社记者报道：骑上了千里马的朝鲜北部钢铁工人正在边生产边建设，革新技术，改善设备，决心要在今年使朝鲜的钢铁产量超过历史上最高纪录，并且要在今年10月底以前完成两座高炉的恢复工程。
    朝鲜金属工业省的负责干部说，在战时遭受了严重破坏的朝鲜钢铁工业，今年的生铁产量将超过日本统治时期最高年产量四十万吨的水平。
    朝鲜的钢和钢材的生产也以同样的速度发展着。黄海制铁所炼钢车间的工人在今年年初就展开了十一小时炼一炉钢的运动。在这个厂的高炉投入生产以后，三座平炉就可直接用铁水炼钢，炼钢速度就会进一步加快。炼钢工人今年决心生产二十三万吨以上的钢，比去年增产十万吨。
    改建和扩建设备以及革新冶金技术是朝鲜钢铁工业在战后恢复和发展的一大特点。今年朝鲜的钢铁工人在这方面取得了重大的成就。最显著的例子是，完全由朝鲜冶金部门的职工自己设计和施工而恢复起来的黄海制铁所的第一号高炉的机械化程度和产量都远远超过了过去。特别是这座高炉从今年7月开始在世界上第一次正式用铁焦炼铁以来，产量大大提高，已由6月下旬的日产量四百六十多吨增加到目前的六百三十多吨，今后还可能继续增加。
    现在，朝鲜钢铁工业的基本建设正以空前的规模进展。各个钢铁厂都在大兴土木，高炉、炼焦炉、平炉、轧钢车间等各种恢复和建设工程都在齐头并进，其中以黄海和金策两个制铁所的工程规模最大。这两个厂都要在最近几年内建成大型的钢铁联合企业。
    据新华社平壤27日电　汉城消息：由于李承晚集团和南朝鲜买办资本家的残酷压榨，南朝鲜工人在死亡和疾病的威胁下过着地狱般的生活。
    由于各厂矿没有安全设备，南朝鲜工人发生伤亡事故的现象非常严重。南朝鲜“产业经济新闻”说，李承晚集团的国营企业“大韩煤炭公司”属下的六个矿山在三年期间，平均每天发生十次以上的伤亡事故。
    今年以来，南朝鲜的工业进一步破产。资本家在大批解雇工人的同时，对于未解雇的工人也采取了延长劳动时间的掠夺措施。据南朝鲜通讯社估计，今春以来，李承晚集团的国营企业已经解雇了一千八百多人。“大韩纺织会社”的大丘工厂一次就解雇了60％的工人。
    由于劳动条件恶劣和劳动时间过长，南朝鲜的患病工人日益增加。连南朝鲜当局保健社会部的一个统计中也不得不承认，在五万三千多名工人中，有一万一千名有各种疾病。“朝鲜日报”说，目前在南朝鲜的工人总数中有三分之一以上患有肺病或其他慢性病。
