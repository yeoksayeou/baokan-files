The statistical work following the Baoding on-site meeting has also seen a new situation of great leap forward across the country.

What are the characteristics of the recent great leap forward in statistical work? First, it puts politics in command, closely integrates statistical work with the central tasks of the Party, and wholeheartedly serves political struggle and production struggle. Whatever the Party and government leaders need, we will collect statistics on it; wherever the political movement and production movement develop, statistical work will follow. The result of doing so is not only greatly enriching the content of statistical work, changing the face of statistical work from cold and deserted to vigorous; more importantly, it promotes the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and is conducive to improving the leadership methods and leadership style of Party and government cadres at and below the county level.

Experiences from various places have consistently proven that before the reform of statistical work, and before the statistical departments uniformly undertook the statistics of the Party's central tasks and production progress, the vast majority of cadres at and below the county level spent most of their time asking for numbers and running around for information, and had little time to go deep into reality to discover and solve problems, let alone participate in production. When meetings were held, often a three-day meeting would spend two days reporting and checking numbers, leaving no time to systematically summarize and exchange experiences and solve practical problems in production. After the reform of statistical work, the situation changed significantly. Because the statistical departments uniformly undertook the statistics of the Party's central tasks and promptly grasped the situation of production progress, this not only basically eliminated the phenomenon of rampant reports in rural areas that had not been resolved for many years, and unified various statistical figures, but also greatly reduced the burden of rural work cadres (generally reduced by half to two-thirds or more compared to the past), allowing them to be liberated from the piles of numbers and have more time to go deep into reality, discover problems, and solve problems in a timely manner, or participate in production labor. When meetings are held, because statistical cadres have already prepared complete statistical data, the meetings can focus on exchanging and summarizing experiences and solving problems in work and production, without having to spend time compiling numbers on the spot. In this way, it also effectively helped grassroots work cadres change their work style of not going deep into reality and not going deep into production. Precisely because of this, the reform of statistical work has also won the welcome and strong support of the vast number of grassroots cadres and the masses, who praised this event in various forms such as folk songs, rhymes, and big-character posters.

Because statistical work is closely integrated with the central tasks of the Party, and the statistical departments promptly grasp various production progress figures, this not only helps Party and government leaders understand the overall situation in a timely manner and guide the work with a clear understanding, but also directly promotes the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Recently, under the leadership of the local Party committees, statistical departments in various places have used statistical data and adopted various forms, such as visualized statistical charts, comparison boards, leap forward platforms, and big-character posters, to widely carry out various comparison activities, which has powerfully promoted the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. As the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said: "Learning and promoting the experience of Hebei Province's statistical work is not just a matter of reforming statistical work itself, but to a large extent, it is related to improving the work style of thousands of rural work cadres, related to improving the Party's leadership methods, and related to the great leap forward in agricultural production and the entire rural work. It is a political task, not a purely technical work."

Secondly, the principle of Party committee leadership, statistical departments responsible, and mobilizing the broad masses to participate in statistical work by the whole Party and the whole people has been implemented. Our Party has always advocated and adhered to the working method of the mass line in both revolutionary work and construction work, believing that only in this way can things be truly done well and can the enthusiasm and creativity of various localities and the broad masses be fully utilized. However, in the past period, a considerable number of statistical cadres did not recognize the problem in this way, and did not follow this method to do statistics, but held a mysterious view, believing that statistical work was a matter for a few experts and could not follow the mass line. Therefore, they only relied on statistical organizations at all levels and a small number of full-time statistical cadres to do statistics, emphasizing the vertical leadership in statistical work; all report systems, indicator systems, and calculation methods must be uniformly stipulated and consistent from top to bottom; all statistical data must be collected and sorted out by full-time cadres of statistical organizations themselves, and they must never rely on localities, let alone rely on the masses. In the eyes of those who advocate doing so, if the statistical organizations and statistical work are placed under the direct leadership of the local Party committees, it may damage the scientific nature and integrity of statistical work, and there may also be "localism" and "departmentalism," damaging the authenticity of statistical data, and of course, it is even more impossible to mobilize the broad masses to participate in statistical work. In the eyes of these people, only statistical departments and statistical cadres are proficient in statistical business, and other people are laymen and cannot do statistics.

Obviously, this view and practice are wrong. The result of doing so will inevitably lead to statistical work gradually deviating from the leadership of Party committees at all levels and embarking on the road of deviating from politics and deviating from reality. Under such circumstances, even if the statistical departments and statistical cadres subjectively want to serve the Party and government leaders and are very willing to closely integrate statistical work with political struggle and production struggle, the result will inevitably be contrary to their wishes. Because it is impossible to prescribe a unified set of report systems and indicator systems from the central government to fully include the different situations of various political movements and production movements, and the various different needs of Party and government leading organs at all levels at various times. The root cause of the different degrees of detachment from politics and detachment from reality in statistical work in various places in the past few years lies here.

Facts have proved that to do a good job in statistical work, it is necessary to adopt the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, place statistical organizations and statistical work at all levels directly under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and organize and mobilize the broad masses to participate in statistical work, and implement the whole Party and the whole people to run statistics. All statistical report systems, indicator systems, and calculation methods must not only have unified regulations, but also be adapted to the time and place, and fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of various localities and the broad masses. Only in this way can statistical work closely serve Party and government leading organs and the masses, serve political struggle and production struggle, and play a huge role in the high tide of socialist construction. The great reform and great leap forward of statistical work in Hebei Province is not the result of certain "statistical experts" delving into business, but the result of putting politics in command, breaking down dogmatism and conservative thinking in statistical work, breaking down the mysterious view of statistical methods and systems, and implementing the mass line and implementing the whole Party and the whole people to run statistics.

Perhaps some people worry that the implementation of the whole Party and the whole people to run statistics will reduce the accuracy of statistical data? Not only will it not reduce it, but it will also greatly help to improve the accuracy of statistical data. Facts have proved that only by placing statistical work directly under the leadership of the Party committee and having statistical data directly meet with the masses can the accuracy of statistical figures be more guaranteed by the frequent inspection and supervision of the Party committee and the masses.

The experience of various places in reforming statistical work shows that as long as politics is put in command, the direction is correct, and thinking is liberated, statistical work will change its past face and a new, lively, and vigorous situation will emerge. We believe that under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels, the implementation of the principle of the whole Party and the whole people to run statistics will surely achieve the slogan put forward by this Baoding on-site meeting: work hard for three months to achieve a great reform and a great leap forward in national statistical work!

　　全党全民办统计
    统计工作保定现场会议以后，全国各地的统计工作也开始出现了大跃进的新形势。
    最近的统计工作大跃进，有什么特点呢？首先，是政治挂帅，使统计工作紧密地与党的中心工作结合起来，切切实实地为政治斗争、生产斗争服务；党政领导需要什么，就统计什么，政治运动、生产运动开展到那里，统计工作就跟到那里。这样做的结果，不仅大大丰富了统计工作内容，改变了统计工作面貌，由冷冷清清变为轰轰烈烈；更重要的是促进了工农业生产大跃进，有利于改进县以下各级党政干部的领导方法和领导作风。
    各地的经验一致证明，在统计工作改革以前，在统计部门没有统一承担党的各项中心工作和生产进度的统计以前，县及县以下的广大干部，大部分时间都用在要数字、跑情况方面，很少有时间深入实际，发现问题、解决问题，更没有时间参加生产。开起会来，也往往是三天的会，汇报数字、核对数字就用去了两天，没有时间系统地总结、交流经验和解决生产中的实际问题。统计工作改革后，情况就显著不同了。由于统计部门统一承担了党的中心工作统计，及时掌握了生产进度情况，这就不仅基本上杜绝了多年来没有解决的农村中报表泛滥成灾的现象，统一了各种统计数字，而且大大减轻了农村工作干部的负担（与过去比较，一般都减少了一半到三分之二以上的时间），使他们得以从数字堆中解放出来，有更多的时间深入实际，发现问题，及时解决问题，或者参加生产劳动。开起会来，由于统计干部已经准备好了完整的统计资料，会议就可以着重于交流、总结经验，解决工作中、生产中的问题，用不着再花时间现凑数字了。这样，也就有效地帮助了基层工作干部改变不深入实际、不深入生产的工作作风。正因为如此，所以统计工作的改革工作，也就博得了广大基层干部和群众的欢迎和大力支持，他们用民歌、顺口溜、大字报等各种形式赞扬这件事。
    由于统计工作紧密地与党的中心工作结合起来了，统计部门及时地掌握了各种生产进度数字，这就不仅帮助了党政领导及时了解全面情况，做到心中有数地去指导工作，而且也直接推动了工农业生产的大跃进。最近一个时期，各地统计部门在当地党委的领导下，运用统计资料，采取多种多样的形式，如形象化的统计图表、评比榜、跃进台、大字报等，广泛开展了各种评比工作，这样，就有力地促进了工农业生产的大跃进。正如中共陕西省委所说的：“学习与推广河北省统计工作的经验，不只是改革统计工作本身的问题，而是在很大的程度上关系到改进成千成万农村工作干部作风的问题，关系到改进党的领导方法的问题，关系到农业生产和整个农村工作大跃进的问题，是一个政治任务，绝不是单纯的技术工作”。
    其次，贯彻执行了党委领导、统计部门负责、发动广大群众参加的全党、全民办统计的方针。我们的党，不论在革命工作中，或建设工作中，一向提倡和坚持群众路线的工作方法，认为只有这样，才能真正把事情办好，才能充分发挥各地方和广大群众的积极性、创造性。但是，在过去一个时期内，相当多的一部分统计干部，并不这样认识问题，不是遵循着这种方法去办统计，而是抱着一种神秘观点，认为统计工作是少数专家办的事情，不能走群众路线。因此，他们只靠各级统计机构和少数专职统计干部办统计，强调统计工作中的垂直领导；一切报表制度、指标体系、计算方法，都要统一规定，上下一致，一切统计资料，都必须由统计机构的专职干部亲自来收集和整理，决不能依靠地方，更不能依靠群众。在主张这样做的人看来，如果把统计机构、统计工作置于地方党委的直接领导之下，就可能损害统计工作的科学性、完整性，还有可能出现“地方主义”和“本位主义”，损害统计资料的真实性，当然更不能发动广大群众来参加统计工作了。在这些人的眼里，只有统计部门、统计干部，才精通统计业务，其他的人都是外行，不能办统计。
    很明显，这种观点、做法，是错误的。这样做的结果，必然会使统计工作逐渐脱离各级党的领导，走上脱离政治、脱离实际的道路。在这种情况下，即使统计部门、统计干部主观上很想为党政领导服务，很愿意使统计工作与政治斗争、生产斗争密切结合起来，但结果仍免不了事与愿违。因为要想由中央来规定一套统一的报表制度、指标体系，把各种政治运动、生产运动的不同情况，把各级党政领导机关在各个时期的各种不同需要，完全包括在内，是不可能的。过去几年各地统计工作中所存在的程度不同的脱离政治、脱离实际的局面，根本原因就在这里。
    事实证明，要办好统计工作，必须采取统一领导，分级管理的原则，把各级统计机构、各种统计工作，直接置于各级党委的领导之下，并组织、发动广大群众来参加统计工作，实行全党、全民办统计。一切统计报表制度、指标体系、计算方法，既要有统一规定，又要因时、因地制宜，充分发挥各地方和广大群众的积极性、创造性。只有这样，才可能使统计工作紧密地为党政领导机关和群众服务，为政治斗争、生产斗争服务，在社会主义建设高潮中发挥巨大的作用。河北省统计工作的大改革，大跃进，并不是某些“统计专家”钻业务钻出来的，而是政治挂帅，破除了统计工作中的教条主义和保守思想，破除了统计方法制度上的神秘观点的结果，是贯彻执行群众路线，实行全党、全民办统计的结果。
    也许有人担心实行全党全民办统计，会不会降低统计资料的正确性呢？不但不会降低，而且还大大有助于提高统计资料的正确性。事实证明，只有把统计工作直接置于党委的领导之下，统计资料直接和群众见面，才能使统计数字经常得到党委和群众的检查、监督，正确性才能更有保证。
    各地改革统计工作的经验表明，只要政治挂帅，方向正确，思想解放，统计工作就会一改过去的面貌，出现新的生动活泼的、轰轰烈烈的局面。我们相信，在各级党委的直接领导下，贯彻执行全党、全民办统计的方针，一定能够胜利实现这次保定现场会议所提出的口号：苦战三月，实现全国统计工作的大改革，大跃进！
