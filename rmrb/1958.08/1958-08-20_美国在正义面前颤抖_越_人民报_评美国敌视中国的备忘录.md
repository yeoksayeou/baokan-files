Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th. The "People's Daily" published a commentary today, pointing out that the U.S. State Department's memorandum issued on August 11, reiterating that the United States does not recognize the People's Republic of China and stating that the United States will persist in being hostile to the Chinese people, is merely a trembling expression of the U.S. authorities in the face of China's just and awe-inspiring condemnation of its aggression against the Middle East and many other countries.

The commentary stated that the United States has not recognized China for eight years and stubbornly adopted a policy of hostility towards China; however, China still exists and is growing stronger at an unprecedented speed. The whole world admires China's great achievements in construction. The whole world sees and appreciates China's tremendous contributions to the cause of defending peace.

The commentary said that the U.S. State Department thinks it can shift the direction of public opinion and evade the crimes of the U.S. and Britain in invading Lebanon and Jordan, which is rather foolish. How can it explain the policy of non-recognition of China? Apart from repeating slanders against China, it has not found any other new "reasons." Even American newspapers have had to say that the American policy is truly foolish, wrong, and too unrealistic. (Attached picture)

　　美国在正义面前颤抖
　　越“人民报”评美国敌视中国的备忘录
    新华社河内19日电  “人民报”今天发表评论，指出美国国务院在8月11日发表重申美国不承认中华人民共和国和表示美国将坚持同中国人民为敌的备忘录，只不过是美国当局在中国正义凛然地斥责它侵略中近东和其它许多国家的声音面前的一种颤抖的表现。
    评论说，美国八年来没有承认中国，并且顽固地采取敌视中国的政策；但是，中国仍然存在着，并且正在以史无前例的速度壮大起来。全世界都钦佩中国在建设事业中取得的伟大成就。全世界都看到，并且感谢中国对保卫和平事业所作出的巨大贡献。
    评论说，美国国务院以为自己可以转移舆论的方向，回避美、英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的罪行，这未免太愚蠢了。它怎样来解释不承认中国的政策呢？除了重复诬蔑中国的论调外，没有找到其它任何新的“理由”。就连美国报纸也不得不说，美国的政策真是愚笨、错误、太不面对现实了。（附图片）
