　　I Love the Crosstalk "Sailor Destroys Superstition"
　　Zhao Shuli
    This crosstalk uses the first person to tell the story of a pseudo-scientist who blindly believes in books and foreign countries, and who runs into snags everywhere in actual production. The outline of the story is this: a person who studied shipbuilding and ship repair in the United States usually only gesticulates based on books. During the Great Leap Forward, when sailors wanted to repair a ship themselves, the higher authorities sent him to help. He brought a large box of books to the shipyard. In actual work, not only could he not help at all, but he also said that people didn't have specialized knowledge and couldn't repair it at all. However, when the sailors had practical difficulties and asked him, this person with specialized knowledge, for advice, he was even more ignorant than them—because he had never seen anything outside of the books—in the end, watching the others repair the ship, he had no choice but to pick up his box of books and leave. Naturally, the story isn't told in such a rigid way in the crosstalk—you could even say it's not a story at all—but the main content is roughly like this. If you haven't heard this crosstalk and read my introduction of the content first, you might think this is a conceptual work. Let me explain to you first: I listened to a work with genuine feelings first, and then turned it into a "concept" before introducing it to everyone. This "conceptualization" is what I "transformed," and it has nothing to do with the author.
    This work has two major characteristics: first, it provides a thorough analysis of pseudo-intellectuals. He describes this pseudo-intellectual as reading books by the ton, blindly believing in foreign teachers, looking for the highest leaders when something happens, unwilling to talk to ordinary people, extravagantly praising the magic of science, and having no perceptual knowledge. Second, the exaggerations precisely highlight the essence of things, with very little idle chatter just for amusement. For example, it is said that this gentleman usually brings a scale when borrowing books from the library, and doesn't read anything that isn't heavy enough. In fact, you don't need a scale to pick out large books, but saying it this way highlights this gentleman's hobby even more. Another example is when a sailor asks: "What should I do if the main shaft is overheating?" This gentleman says: "What is a main shaft?" Naturally, someone who has studied shipbuilding wouldn't be ignorant of even the large components, but people who only study books are buried in books all day long, and the names of objects commonly used by practical workers often differ from those in their books—like calling a "switch" a "power gate" or calling a "vacuum tube" a "light bulb," anyone who doesn't come into contact with reality will encounter this problem—plus, even if he recognizes it, he can't immediately answer how to fix it when there's a problem, because the task of studying books often only goes as far as "recognizing." Then the sailors asked many questions: "What should I do if the oil pipe is leaking?" "What should I do if the iron anchor is rusty?"... His every answer is "Send it to the factory." Naturally, anyone can see that some things don't need to be sent to the factory, but to hear it from this gentleman's mouth, everyone feels that he deserves to be ridiculed like that. When I was in school, I showed my father a "Physiology and Hygiene" textbook that I had learned. After reading it, he said to me: "This book doesn't need to be studied! Every minor illness is 'Consult a doctor, or send to the hospital,' what 'hygiene' is being 'protected'?" It can be seen that this guiding ideology of "send it to the factory" has a tradition—that is, "knowledge" is learned only to the point of "recognition," and anything further must be handled by the technical departments.
    In addition, even if there is a bit of idle chatter, it is not far from the topic, and it becomes interesting with a touch. For example, before setting off to the shipyard, this gentleman went home and shooed the children away, saying: "Go, go, go! Daddy wants to read!" After a while, the child came in with something and said: "Daddy! Here you go!" He took a look and saw that it was a scale weight. He said, "What are you playing with this for? You'll smash your foot!" "Daddy! Didn't you want to weigh it?" "Good boy! It's already been weighed!" Saying that reading books requires weighing is already exaggerated enough to illustrate his characteristics, and then using the child to send a scale weight to ridicule him is still a supplement to the scale weight for books. It wouldn't be a defect without it, but it's even more interesting with it.
    I love this crosstalk very much. I think this is a good work with clear ideas and concise writing; a good work that is both popular and very advanced. With such works, it is enough to answer the erroneous view that "popularization must lower political and artistic standards."

### 我爱相声“水兵破迷信”

　　我爱相声“水兵破迷信”
　　赵树理
    这段相声，是用第一人称说出一个迷信书本、迷信外国的假科学家在实际生产中处处碰钉子的故事。故事的轮廓是这样：一个在美国学过造船修船的人，平常只凭书本指手划脚，在大跃进中水兵自己要修船，上级派他去帮忙，他便带着一大箱子书到船坞上去。在实际工作中，他不但不能帮一点忙，反而说人家都没有专门知识，根本不能修；不过水兵们有了实际困难来向他这位有专门知识的人请教，他反而比人家还没有知识——因为书本以外的东西他根本没有见过——结果看着人家把船修好了，他只好搬起书箱离开那里。自然故事到了相声里不是这样死板板往下说的——也可以说根本不是故事——不过主要内容大概是这样。假如你没有听过这段相声而先看了我这一段内容介绍，恐怕要以为这是个概念化的作品。我这里先向你解释一下：我是先听了人家有真情实感的作品，然后化成了“概念”才给大家介绍出来的。这“概念化”是我“化”了的，与作者无关。
    这个作品有两大特点：第一是对假知识分子作了透彻的分析。他介绍这位假知识分子是读书论吨、迷信外国老师、有事找最高领导、不愿同凡人答话、漫夸科学神妙、毫无感性知识。第二是夸张的地方恰好突出事物的本质，很少有单纯逗笑的闲文。例如说这位先生平常到图书馆借书都要带秤，不够分量的不看。事实上挑大部头书不必用秤，可是这样说就更能突出这位先生的嗜好。又如一个水兵问：“大轴发热怎么办？”这位先生说：“什么是大轴啊？”自然，学过造船的人还不至于连大件数也认不得，只是啃书本的人成天埋在书里，在实际工作者口头上常叫的物件名称和他书本上的往往有出入——如把“开关”叫“电门”、把“真空管”叫“灯泡”之类，谁不接触实际，都会碰到这问题——再加上即使他认得，有了毛病他也马上回答不出怎么治，因为啃书本的任务往往是到了“认得”为止。接着水兵们提出好多问题：“油管子漏水怎么办”，“铁锚生锈怎么办”……他的每一个回答，都是“送工厂去”。自然有些事谁也可以看出不必送工厂，只是要从这位先生口里说出来，谁也觉得该那样挖苦他一下子。我当年上学的时候，把我学的一本“生理卫生”课本给我父亲看。他看了和我说：“这书可以不用念！屁大点病都是‘延医诊治，或送医院’，还‘卫’得个什么‘生’？”可见“送工厂去”这一指导思想是有传统的——就是“知识”学到“认识”为止，再进一步就都得技术部门。
    此外，即使有点闲文，也离题不远，而且触手成趣。例如这位先生当出发到船坞之前，回家把孩子们都哄出去说：“走走走！爸爸要看书！”一会，孩子抱着个东西送进来说：“爸爸！给你！”他一看，是个秤铊。他说：“玩这个干吗？砸脚！”“爸爸！你不是要称一称吗？”“好孩子！这都称过了！”说读书用秤称已经够夸张了，够说明他的特性了，再用孩子送秤铊来奚落他，仍是秤书余文，没有也不算缺陷，有了就更觉有趣。
    我很爱这段相声。我认为这是一篇思想鲜明、文章精练的好作品；是一篇既能普及又很高级的好作品。有了这样的作品，就足以回答“普及一定要降低政治和艺术水平”的错误看法。
