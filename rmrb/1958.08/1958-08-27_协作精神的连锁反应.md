　　The spirit of communist collaboration, where the Beijing Second Machine Tool Plant sacrifices itself for others, is truly moving. What is also thought-provoking is this: Before this, enterprises like the Beijing People's Machine Factory and the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant offered enthusiastic assistance to the Beijing Second Machine Tool Plant when it encountered difficulties in production; this enthusiastic assistance inspired the Beijing Second Machine Tool Plant to use the same spirit of communist collaboration to support other fraternal enterprises. From this, we see the chain reaction of the spirit of collaboration: one spreading to ten, ten spreading to a hundred. This kind of chain reaction has unlimited power, just like atomic fission; it not only eliminates many difficulties on the road to developing material production, but also sows the seeds of communist collaborative thought everywhere.

　　This chain reaction of the spirit of collaboration correctly reflects the dialectical relationship between "I for everyone" and "everyone for me." "I for everyone," even to the point of "sacrificing oneself for others," does not originally take "everyone for me" as a prerequisite. However, the promotion and development of this unconditional communist style of "I for everyone" and "sacrificing oneself for others" will inevitably produce a chain reaction of the spirit of collaboration. If everyone is "I for everyone," the result will naturally be "everyone for me."

　　However, some people always feel that collaboration is a "loss" when it is mentioned. These people think, "If I give you the materials, what will I do when I need them myself in the future?" "If I help you, who will help me?" Therefore, they always try to push away or delay collaboration. If these people do not have a bit of the dregs of "man for himself and the devil take the hindmost" in the depths of their minds, then they just do not see the inevitable connection between "I for everyone" and "everyone for me." If the spirit of communist collaboration is promoted and developed, everyone under heaven will benefit. How could those who have given collaboration to others be an exception?

　　The chain reaction of atomic fission is an inevitable physical phenomenon. The chain reaction of the spirit of collaboration is an inevitable social phenomenon in socialist society. Because the relationship between people in socialist society is fundamentally different from that in class society. The relationship between people in socialist society is equal, mutually supportive, and collaborative, and therefore the communist spirit of sacrificing oneself for others is the mainstream. We cannot tolerate the phenomenon of "harming others to benefit oneself" or deceit and trickery. Therefore, it is necessary to work on those who hold individualistic and departmentalist ideas, to educate them with the communist collaborative spirit of others, and to make them pull down the white flag of individualism and departmentalism and raise the red flag of collectivism and mutual assistance and collaboration.

### 协作精神的连锁反应

　　协作精神的连锁反应
　　吴滤
    北京第二机床厂舍己为人的共产主义协作精神，是令人感动的。使人深思的还有这样的事：在这以前，北京人民机器厂、上海机床厂等企业，在北京第二机床厂生产遇到困难的时候，给予热诚的援助；这种热诚的援助启发了北京第二机床厂，也要用同样的共产主义协作精神去支援别的兄弟企业。从这里，我们看到协作精神的连锁反应：一传十，十传百。这种连锁反应也像原子分裂一样具有无限的威力，它不仅排除了发展物质生产道路上的许多困难，而且到处播种着共产主义协作思想的种子。
    这种协作精神的连锁反应，正确反映了“我为人人”和“人人为我”的辩证关系。“我为人人”，以至“舍己为人”，本来是不以“人人为我”做前提的。但这种无条件的“我为人人”、“舍己为人”的共产主义风格的发扬光大，就必然产生协作精神的连锁反应，人人都“我为人人”，结果当然是“人人为我”。
    然而，有些人一提协作总觉得是件“吃亏”的事情。这些人以为，“我把材料给了你，将来我自己要用怎么办呢？”“我帮助了你，谁帮助我呵！”因而，他们对于协作总是能推就推，能拖就拖。这些人若不是思想深处还有点“人不为己，天诛地灭”的渣滓，就是看不见“我为人人”和“人人为我”之间的必然联系。共产主义协作精神的发扬光大，普天之下人人受惠，曾经予人协作者，又何至于例外呢？
    原子分裂的连锁反应是一种必然的物理现象。协作精神的连锁反应就是社会主义社会的必然的社会现象。因为社会主义社会的人与人之间的关系同阶级社会是根本不同的。社会主义社会的人与人之间的关系是平等的、互助协作的，因而舍己为人的共产主义精神是主流。我们对于“损人利己”或是尔虞我诈的现象是不能容许的。所以，对于抱有个人主义、本位主义思想的人就需要做工作，需要用别人的共产主义协作精神去教育他们，要他们把个人主义、本位主义的白旗拔掉，把集体主义、互助协作的红旗插上。
