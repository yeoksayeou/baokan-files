    Luanping Road
    After driving for more than five hours on the winding and undulating road, the car arrived at Gubeikou in Miyun County. I got off here, walked through the Great Wall, and entered the territory of Luanping. When I passed through the first village—Bahashi Camp—two children at a table in front of a small house on the street walked towards me and said, "Stop." I thought, the situation where children's corps checked pedestrians' road passes during the Liberation War probably wouldn't happen anymore, so I was secretly surprised by being stopped. The older boy, about ten years old, pointed to the table, led me there, and asked me to sing a song before leaving. "Sing a song before leaving?" This is truly a wonder of ancient and modern times, and I felt even more baffled.
  "Why do I have to sing a song before leaving?" I said with a smile. The younger boy eagerly answered me, "Pedestrians have to be tested on literacy and singing, everyone has to comply." I still didn't understand what was going on, but blurted out, "I can't sing!" The two children also laughed and shouted in unison, "We don't believe you." After a while, they added, "If you don't sing, you can't leave." Helpless, I had to sing a song "Socialism is Good" for them. Unexpectedly, they applauded and praised me after I finished singing, making my face burn. At this time, a man in his thirties came out of the house, nodded to me as a greeting, and I told him that I had returned from Shaanxi to visit my family. Afterwards, I pointed to the two children listening to our conversation and said that they wouldn't let me go and insisted that I sing. He saw that I looked a bit complaining, invited me to sit down, and explained, "Old fellow villager, we are from the literacy station. The county committee proposed a three-month hard battle to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. Our literacy station has such a task: to test pedestrians' literacy as a supervisory role and to promote the significance of literacy." I asked him, "What if they don't recognize the words?" He said, "Then we teach them, and they can leave after they learn."
    I pointed to the two children listening to our conversation again and said, "Then why didn't they test me on literacy but asked me to sing?" He replied, "Currently, singing movements have been launched in every township and every commune in the county. However, because our county's culture has always been backward, there is no singing culture, and some people still don't like to learn to sing. Therefore, cadres should take the lead and play a model role. We see people dressed as cadres, so we ask them to sing, not test them on literacy, because there are very few illiterate cadres."
    I left Bahashi Camp with indescribable excitement. I felt relaxed all over and couldn't help but sing "Socialism is Good" again.

### 滦平路上

    滦平路上
    在曲折而起伏的公路上奔驰五个多小时，汽车到了密云县的古北口，我在这里下车，徒步穿过万里长城，走进滦平境内。当我通过第一个村子——巴哈什营时，街头一座小房前方桌旁的两个小孩便朝我走了过来，说道：“停一停。”我想，解放战争时期儿童团向行人查路条的情况恐怕不会有了吧，因此，我为我的被拦而暗暗惊奇。那个大点的、年约十多岁的男孩指了指桌子，引我到了那里，让我唱个歌再走。“唱个歌再走？”这真是今古奇观，我更觉得莫名其妙了。
  “为什么要唱歌再走？”我笑了笑说。那个年纪更小点的男孩抢先回答我：“行人都是要考字唱歌的，谁也得遵守。”我仍不明白怎么回事，但随口说：“我不会唱呀！”两个孩子也笑着异口同声的嚷嚷“我们不信”，过一会儿又补充说，“你不唱就甭走啦。”我无可奈何，只得为他俩唱一支
  “社会主义好”。不料唱完他们就鼓掌称好，弄得我脸上热辣辣的。这时，从屋里走出个三十多岁的人，对我点点头打招呼，我告诉他，我是由陕西回来探家的。随后，我指着身旁的两个孩子说，他们不让我走路，一定叫我唱歌。他看出了我有点带抱怨的神情，一边请我坐下一边解释说：“老同乡呀，我们是扫盲站的。县委提出苦战三个月，消灭青壮年文盲。我们扫盲站有这么个任务，就是考行人识字，起个督促作用，宣传扫盲意义。”我问他：“不认得怎么办？”他说：“那就教他，学会了再走。”
    我又指着听我们谈话的俩个孩子说：“那末，他们为什么不考我字却让我唱歌呢？”他回答道：“目前，全县乡乡学唱歌，社社学唱歌，掀起了歌咏运动。但由于咱们县文化一向落后，没有歌咏的风气，现在还有部分群众不爱学歌。所以，当干部的应该带头，起模范作用。我们看见干部打扮的，就让他唱歌，不考字，因为当干部的很少有文盲。”
    我怀着难以形容的激动心情离开了巴哈什营村。我满身轻松，不禁又唱起“社会主义好”来。
