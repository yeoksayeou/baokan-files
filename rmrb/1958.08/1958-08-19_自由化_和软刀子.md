　　“Liberalization” and the Soft Knife
　　Shangguan Hong
    Imperialists are the most ferocious and cunning butchers and executioners. They wield two knives: a steel knife and a soft knife, which are militaristic military aggression and appeasing political and economic aggression. Their methods of aggression have always combined toughness and gentleness, hardness and softness.
    When imperialists carry out blatant military aggression against a country, this act of aggression not only causes widespread death and destruction in the country, but also potentially provokes large-scale war, which goes against the peaceful wishes of the people of all countries and is a bad thing. However, the hideous face of the aggressor is exposed, allowing the people of all countries to more clearly recognize the essence of imperialism, thereby uniting to carry out a resolute struggle, which is a good thing. When imperialists, fearing the strength of the forces of peace, dare not openly launch a war, this is a major victory for the people of all countries in defending peace and a good thing. However, when imperialists turn to political disintegration, it easily confuses some people and makes them complacent, which may weaken their fighting spirit and is a bad thing.
    Therefore, when imperialists carry out military aggression, we should oppose war with resolute struggle and defend peace; when imperialists are forced to abandon the means of war, we should continue to expose the aggressor's mask and educate the people not to be fooled. As the Ming Dynasty loyalist Mu Pisanren said, "...A soft knife cuts off the head without one realizing they are dying." Imperialists, especially American imperialists, are very good at using this soft knife.
    Now, the blatant armed aggression of the American and British imperialists against Lebanon and Jordan has not only met with strong resistance from the Arab world, but also with the firm opposition of the world's peaceful forces, with the people of the Soviet Union and China as the main force. This time, the imperialists are unprecedentedly isolated. An article by American columnist Walter Lippmann published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on July 22nd had to admit that "the Arab people's revolutionary movement cannot be conquered by Western force. This basic truth also applies to our current situation in Lebanon," he lamented that the policy towards Lebanon "lacks diplomatic vitality" and said that "we should not cling to our old ways."
    Therefore, "the United States and Britain have decided to adopt a policy aimed at appeasement and division." A report published in the British "News Chronicle" on July 23rd wrote, "It seems that we need to learn to get along with the new Iraqi government, or we risk facing a worse situation." According to a July 28th revelation in the Cairo "Al-Akhbar," Macmillan intends to pretend to recognize that "Arab nationalism is an independent movement," and he "suggested improving" "relations" with the Arab world. Dulles is said to "also agree with this policy," calling it "liberalization of American official policy." The current American and British aggressors recognizing Iraq is probably a concrete manifestation of this "liberalization"!
    But we must remember firmly that no matter how "liberalized" their "policies" are, a butcher is still a butcher, and whether it is a steel knife or a soft knife, it is still a fierce weapon for slaughtering the people. A secret telegram published by the Egyptian "Al-Ahram" on July 26th, which revealed the American conspiracy to undermine the United Arab Republic and encompass the Middle East, bluntly admitted: "Of course, this is by no means to fundamentally re-evaluate our policies; this is just a tactical temporary change out of necessity." Unfreezing some funds, easing some restrictions, plus a little "American aid," a little "surplus materials," a little "relief flour," is this "imperial grace" given freely? We have long exposed such things: "Giving is possible, but there are conditions. What conditions? That is, follow me." "Food offered in contempt is painful to eat." (See Xinhua News Agency editorial "Farewell, Leighton Stuart").
    The aggressors have not yet withdrawn their troops from the Middle East, so we must still guard against the steel knife, but what is more important now is to guard against this "liberalized" soft knife.
    However, the times have changed after all. The era in which the imperialist butchers arbitrarily slaughtered the colonial people is gone forever. As long as the people are united and vigilant, and never give up the struggle against the imperialist aggressors, whether it is with a steel knife or a soft knife, they will no longer have the possibility of using old tricks and doing whatever they want. Thinking that "liberalizing" the "policy" a little will gain them something is just a delusion of their own feverish minds.

　　“自由化”和软刀子
　　上官红
    帝国主义者是最凶残也最狡猾的屠夫和刽子手。他们手里拿着两把刀：钢刀和软刀，这就是黩武的军事侵略和怀柔的政治、经济侵略。他们侵略的手法从来就是钢柔并济、硬软兼施。
    当帝国主义者对一个国家进行明目张胆的军事侵略的时候，他们这种侵略罪行不仅使一个国家遭到生灵涂炭，而且有可能由此挑起大规模战争，这是违背各国人民的和平意愿的，是一件坏事；但是，它的侵略者的狰狞面貌却由此而暴露无遗，使各国人民更清楚地认识到帝国主义的本质，从而团结起来进行坚决的斗争，这却是一件好事。当帝国主义者慑于和平力量的强大，不敢公然发动战争的时候，这是各国人民维护和平斗争的重大胜利，是一件好事；但是，帝国主义者转而采取政治分化的时候，却容易迷惑某些人的视听，使人们产生麻痹思想，从而可能涣散斗志，这却是一件坏事。
    所以，当帝国主义者实行军事侵略的时候，我们应该以坚决的斗争反对战争而维护和平；当帝国主义者被迫放弃战争手段的时候，我们应该继续揭露侵略者的画皮，教育人民不要上了它的当。明代遗民木皮散人说得好，“……软刀子割头不觉死。”帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者是很善于使用这种软刀子的。
    现在，美英帝国主义者对于黎巴嫩和约旦的公然武装侵略，不仅遭到了阿拉伯世界的强烈反抗，而且也遭到以苏中两国人民为主力的世界和平力量的坚决反对；这一次，帝国主义者是空前地孤立了。“纽约先驱论坛报”7月22日刊载的美国专栏作家李普曼的一篇文章也不得不承认，“阿拉伯人的人民革命运动不是西方武力所能征服的。这一基本真理也适用于我们目前在黎巴嫩的处境，”他慨叹着对黎巴嫩的政策“缺乏外交活力”，并且说“我们不应该死抱住我们的老一套的办法”。
    所以，“美国和英国已经决定采取一种目的在于拉拢和分裂的政策。”英国“新闻纪事报”7月23日发表的一篇报道中这样写道，“看来，我们似乎需要学习跟伊拉克新政府相处，否则就有面临更糟的局面的危险。”据开罗“消息报”7月28日揭露，麦克米伦打算假装承认“阿拉伯民族主义是一种独立运动”，他“建议改善”同阿拉伯世界的“关系”，据说杜勒斯“也赞成这种政策”，他把这叫做“美国官方政策的自由化。”目前的美英侵略者承认伊拉克，大概就是这种“自由化”的具体表现吧！
    但是我们应该牢牢记住，不管他们的“政策”怎样“自由化”，屠伯终究还是屠伯，不论钢刀还是软刀，终究都是宰割人民的凶器。埃及“金字塔报”7月26日公布的美国阴谋破坏阿联、囊括中东的一封秘密电报一语道破地供认：“当然这绝不是说要对我国政策从根本上进行重新估价；这只是出于必要而作的一种策略上的暂时改变。”解冻些款项，放宽些限制，外加一点“美援”、一点“剩余物资”、一点“救济粉”，这难道是
  “皇恩浩荡”，平白奉送的吗？关于这类事，我们早就揭穿过：“送是可以的，要有条件。什么条件呢？就是跟我走。”“嗟来之食，吃下去肚子要痛的。”（见新华社社论“别了，司徒雷登”）。
    侵略者还没有从中东撤兵，因此钢刀也还要谨防，但目前更重要的是要防这“自由化”了的软刀子。
    然而，时代终究是已经变了，帝国主义的屠伯们任意宰割殖民地人民的时代已经一去不复返了，只要人民团结而又提高警惕，一时一刻也不放弃同帝国主义侵略者的斗争，无论是用钢刀，还用是软刀，都不会再有施展故技，为所欲为的可能；以为把“政策”“自由化”一下，就会捞到些什么，不过是它们自己热极发昏的幻想而已。
