Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Guo Shaojun reports: Song Hongzhao, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, is trialing traditional Chinese medicine gromwell root to treat the gynecological disease choriocarcinoma, with preliminary observations showing good results. Among the ten patients treated, eight have shown significant improvement. The symptoms of most people, such as hemoptysis, chest tightness, and vomiting, have stopped, and their appetite has increased. Two patients gained two kilograms in weight within a few days.

Cancer is a world-renowned "incurable" disease, and choriocarcinoma is a serious type of gynecological cancer. This disease is caused by the growth of trophoblastic cells from the embryo. Most women who contract the disease do so after a hydatidiform mole or miscarriage, and some develop it after a normal delivery. This cancer easily metastasizes to the brain, lungs, and other areas, and its nature is very serious. Among the patients treated by Song Hongzhao, four had lung metastases. X-ray fluoroscopy showed that the shadows in their lungs had significantly shrunk, and in one person, they had completely disappeared.

Gromwell root is a common traditional Chinese medicine. The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Peking Union Medical College Hospital once studied this medicine as an oral contraceptive and proved in animal experiments that gromwell root has the effect of destroying gonadotropic hormones secreted by the pituitary gland.

When Song Hongzhao attended a discussion in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology about the rescue of Qiu Cai Kang at Shanghai Guangci Hospital, he was greatly moved and inspired. After the meeting, he wondered how to save the few "incurable" patients in the ward. He boldly hypothesized: Since gromwell root can destroy pituitary gonadotropic hormones, could it also destroy chorionic gonadotropin produced by choriocarcinoma? With the strong support of the Party branch and departmental leaders, he conducted experimental treatment.

The discovery of using gromwell root to treat choriocarcinoma is only a preliminary achievement with good results and requires further research, but it powerfully proves that studying traditional Chinese medicine is an important way to conquer the most serious diseases that endanger people's health.

　　医师宋鸿钊试用中药紫草根
    治疗妇科癌症
    据新华社28日讯　新华社特约记者郭少军报道：北京协和医院妇产科医师宋鸿钊试用中药紫草根治疗妇科病绒毛膜上皮癌，初步观察效果良好。在治疗的十个病人中有八人有著显好转，多数人的咳血、胸闷、呕吐等症状已经停止，饮食增加。两个病人的体重在几天内增加两公斤。
    癌症是世界熟知的“不治”症，绒毛膜上皮癌是妇科的一种严重癌症。这种病是由于胚胎的滋养细胞所长成。得病的妇女多数是继葡萄胎或流产后发生的，也有在正常分娩后发生。这种癌症容易转移至脑、肺等处，性质十分严重。在宋鸿钊治疗的病人中，四个有肺转移的病人，经过X光透视，肺部的阴影明显地缩小，有一人已完全消失。
    紫草根是一种普通中药。协和医院妇产科曾把这种药作为口服避孕药加以研究，并在动物实验中证明紫草根有破坏脑垂体所分泌的性腺激素的作用。
    宋鸿钊在妇产科座谈上海广慈医院抢救丘财康的事迹时，受到很大感动和启发。会后，他就想如何挽救病房里的几个“不治”的病人？他大胆设想：既然紫草根能破坏脑垂体性腺激素，是否也能破坏绒毛膜上皮癌所产生的绒毛性腺激素呢？在党支部和科领导的大力支持下，他进行了试验治疗。
    用紫草根治绒毛膜上皮癌的发现，仅是初步获得良好效果，还有待进一步研究，但它有力地证明了研究中医中药是制服危害人民健康最严重的疾病的一个重要途径。
