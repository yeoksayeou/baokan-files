Introducing Technical Experiences for Normal Iron Tapping in Indigenous Blast Furnaces
　　Zhang Jiemin, Wang Zhaoli
The Chun'an Machinery Factory in Zhejiang has two indigenous blast furnaces. Since July 7th, after multiple smeltings, the iron flow has been normal, the iron quality is good, and the output is high. Iron can be tapped every half hour at most, with an average of twelve or thirteen jin each time, and a maximum of twenty-one jin. Each furnace can produce eight hundred and eighty-eight jin of iron per day and night.

How can indigenous blast furnaces consistently produce iron? The following points can be summarized:

　　(1) Attention must be paid to specifications and quality when constructing indigenous blast furnaces. The Chun'an Machinery Factory uses the "three-section indigenous blast furnace," which is divided into five parts: the furnace bottom, the furnace belly, the furnace waist, the furnace body, and the furnace top. It is a total of two hundred and fifty centimeters high, and the diameter of the furnace belly is forty centimeters. The capacity can hold about one hundred and twenty jin of charcoal at a time. The entire furnace is shaped like a vase, which allows the heat to be forced back, increasing the temperature inside the furnace.

The method of manufacturing an indigenous blast furnace: ① Take soil and prepare materials: First, take gold thread mud (clay), dry it in the sun, crush it, and sift it into powder (about seven hundred jin for each indigenous blast furnace). When using, mix it with 30% fine sand and an appropriate amount of water to make the inner layer of the earthen furnace. In addition, take refractory stone (whetstone), grind it into powder (about one hundred jin for each furnace), mix it with 30% ceramic powder, and mix with water to build the refractory furnace wall. ② Make the indigenous blast furnace. The furnace bottom should use a pot, and the pot surface should be the same size as the four sides of the furnace belly, which is convenient for placing the furnace belly. At the same time, using a pot as the furnace bottom can isolate the impact of ground cold on the blast furnace. When making it, break a notch in the edge of the pot and apply clay into the pot. The method of making the furnace belly: first knead the clay into pieces like six-centimeter square bricks, and then stack them into a cylindrical shape, pressing the seams firmly by hand while stacking, and then apply a layer of one or two centimeters of refractory soil on the inside of the furnace belly. The furnace belly is barrel-shaped (that is, small at both ends and large in the middle), which prevents the incoming heat from dissipating upwards, maintaining the central temperature of the furnace belly above 1,600 to 1,700 degrees Celsius. The furnace waist and furnace body use iron oil drums as the outer shell, and the inside is covered with five centimeters of clay and one centimeter of refractory mud. After making it, it should be placed in a cool place to dry in the shade, and at the same time, a wooden hammer should be used to gently tap the seams to make them firm and smooth to avoid cracks and air leakage. After drying in the shade, wrap the outside of the furnace belly with iron sheet.

　　(2) They have also explored some experience in operating methods.

　　① Improved the feeding method. Originally, twenty jin of ore were loaded at a time, resulting in the iron freezing and sometimes not flowing out. The current method is: start by loading charcoal to two-thirds of the furnace, then load coke to the top, and then load materials every five minutes. Because the temperature inside the furnace gradually rises, the method of loading materials is to start with a small amount and gradually increase it. At the beginning, load about five jin of ore each time, and then gradually increase it to eight jin. At the same time, the flat loading method was changed to the inverted loading method. The original flat loading method was: mixed coke and charcoal - ore - limestone. The inverted loading method is: charcoal - ore - mixed coke and limestone. There are two advantages to using the inverted loading method: first, charcoal is light and easily ignites when placed in the lower layer. At the same time, due to the blast, the charcoal can rotate inside the furnace, making the temperature inside the furnace uniform; second, because the ore is fuel on both sides, the two sides attack, forcing the ore to melt.

　　② Improved the tuyere and taphole. Originally, the air inlet was located fourteen centimeters from the bottom of the furnace, and it often became clogged when the ore melted. After research, it was raised to fifteen centimeters. In terms of the taphole, the method of combining iron and slag discharge was changed. After merging into one outlet, it can be opened uniformly, which not only increases the iron tapping rate, but also saves manpower.

　　③ The blower must be suitable for the size of the indigenous blast furnace. With proper air intake, the average temperature inside the furnace reaches above 1,500 degrees Celsius.

　　④ The ore must be crushed and roasted first. If wet, large pieces of ore are put into the furnace, it will reduce the temperature inside the furnace and prolong the iron tapping time.

　　(3) Three issues must be paid attention to during the ironmaking process:

　　① About half an hour to forty-five minutes after loading the materials, when the ore just begins to melt, the taphole should be opened and the slag dug out. According to the old workers' many years of experience in casting pots and practical tests, this method is an important link to ensure normal iron flow. This is because when the first ore melts, the heat inside the furnace is high, but the temperature at the bottom of the furnace is slightly lower. In this way, when the newly melted iron sinks, it is easily affected by the low temperature at the bottom of the furnace and freezes into lumps. If it is not dug out in time, the iron that melts and sinks later will also accumulate and affect normal iron tapping.

　　② When smelting, a broken pot must be placed on the top of the furnace, like a funnel. This can not only serve as a funnel for loading materials, so that the materials can flow into the furnace evenly, but more importantly, placing a broken pot can prevent the heat inside the furnace from dissipating upwards, producing a "backfire" effect and increasing the temperature inside the furnace.

　　③ The taphole should not be sealed directly with mud, because the mud is relatively cold and wet, which will affect the subsequent iron tapping and the temperature inside the furnace; it should be plugged in with wood first, and then covered with mud on the outside. This not only does not affect the temperature inside the furnace, but the wood can also increase the temperature inside the furnace after burning.

　　介绍一个土高炉正常出铁的技术经验
　　张杰民　王召里
    浙江淳安机械厂有两座土高炉，自7月7日到现在，经过多次的冶炼，流铁正常，铁水质量好，产量高。至多半小时就可以出一次铁，每次平均十二、三斤左右，最多的二十一斤。每只炉一昼夜可出铁八百八十八斤。
    怎样使土高炉经常出铁？归纳起来有以下几条：
      （一）建设土高炉必须注意规格和质量。淳安机械厂采用的是“三节土高炉”，分为炉底、炉腹、炉腰、炉身、炉顶五个部分，共高二百五十公分，炉腹直径为四十公分，一次容量可装木炭一百二十斤左右。整个炉子呈花瓶形，这样能使火力反逼，提高炉内温度。
    土高炉的制造方法：①取土备料：先取金丝泥（粘土）晒干打碎，筛成粉末（每只土高炉约七百斤左右），用时掺入30％的细沙和适量的水拌匀，作为制造土炉内层之用，另外取耐火石（磨刀石）研成粉末（每只炉一百斤左右），掺入30％的陶瓷粉，用水拌和，作为砌耐火炉壁之用。②制土高炉，炉底要用一口锅，锅面要与炉腹四周一样大，这样便于放置炉腹。同时，用锅做炉底能够隔绝地面冷气对高炉的影响。做时，要将锅沿敲破一个缺口，用粘土敷入锅内。炉腹的制法：先将粘土揉成一块块六公分见方的砖头一样，再一块块地叠成圆桶形，边叠边用手将合缝处揿实，再在炉腹内部敷上一层一、二公分的耐火土。炉腹呈桶形（即两头小中间大）能够使进风火力不易向上散发，保持炉腹的中心温度在一千六百度至一千七百度以上。炉腰、炉身是用铁油桶当外壳，里面敷上五公分厚的粘土，一公分厚的耐火泥。做好后，要放在阴凉处阴干，同时要经常用木锤轻轻将合缝处敲实抹光，以免裂缝漏气。阴干后再在炉腹外面包上铁皮。
    （二）在操作方法上，他们也摸索出了一些经验。
    ①改进了进料办法。原来一次上二十斤矿石，结果铁水冻结，有时流不出来。现在的办法是：开始时先上木炭到炉的三分之二，再上焦炭到顶，然后再每五分钟上一次料。由于炉内温度是逐渐上升的，上料时采取了由少到多的方法，开始时每次上五斤矿石左右，然后逐渐增加到八斤。同时又将平装法改为倒装法。原来的平装法是：焦炭、木炭混合——矿石——石灰石。倒装法是：木炭——矿石——焦炭、石灰石混合。采取倒装法有两点好处：一、木炭体轻，放在下层容易着火，同时由于鼓风的关系，能使木炭在炉内旋转，使炉内温度均匀；二、由于矿石上下都是燃料，两方夹攻，逼使矿石熔化。
    ②改进鼓风口和出铁口。原来进风口设在离炉底十四公分的地方，矿石熔化时经常要堵塞，经过研究后改高到十五公分。在出铁口方面，改为出铁出渣合一的办法，合并一个出口后，就可统一开启，不但提高出铁率，而且也节约人力。
    ③鼓风机要适合土高炉大小的需要。进风适当，炉内温度平均达到一千五百度以上。
    ④矿石必须先敲碎焙燥。如果将潮湿、大块矿石下炉，就会减低炉内温度，延长出铁时间。
      （三）在炼铁过程中必须注意三个问题：
    ①上料后半小时到四十五分钟左右，等矿石刚开始熔化时，要把出铁口打开，将铁渣挖出。根据老工人多年的铸锅经验和实际试验，证明这个办法是保证正常流铁的重要环节。这是因为第一次矿石熔化时，炉内热度虽高，但炉底温度略低，这样刚熔化的铁水下沉时，容易受炉底低温影响而冻结成块，如果不及时挖出，以后熔化下沉的铁水也会堆积起来影响正常出铁。
    ②在冶炼时，炉顶上必须放一口破锅，如同漏斗一样，这样既能当上料的漏斗，使料均匀地流入炉内，更重要的是放上破锅后，又能使炉内火力不易向上发散，产生“回火”作用，增高炉内温度。
    ③出铁口的封闭不应用烂泥直接封闭，因为烂泥比较冷湿，要影响以后出铁和炉内温度；应该先用木头塞进去，再在外面敷上烂泥。这样既不影响炉内温度，木头燃烧后又能增高炉内温度。
