Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 11th: Lunan Yi Autonomous County and Yiliang County in Yunnan Province have broken down county boundaries to cooperate in mining, solving the problems of Yiliang's lack of resources and Lunan's lack of labor and capital, and promoting the joint leap forward of local industries in both counties.

Lunan and Yiliang counties are adjacent, but their natural conditions and economic foundations are different. Lunan is a mountainous area with abundant mineral resources. However, the county only has 50,000 laborers, and cannot spare a large number of people to mine. Residents also cannot invest much capital in mining. In contrast, Yiliang County is one of the most prosperous agricultural areas in Yunnan, with a population of 200,000 and abundant labor, but it lacks mineral resources. Due to their respective weaknesses, both counties encountered some difficulties in starting to develop local industries. Lunan's initial industrial plan only prepared to produce 37 tons of iron this year. Yiliang needs to vigorously manufacture agricultural tools, machinery, etc. this year, but the required pig iron and coking coal must be purchased from Fuyuan County, more than 300 kilometers away.

In mid-July, in order to develop the iron and steel industry through self-reliance, the leaders of the two counties decided to learn from each other's strengths and cooperate in mining iron and copper mines within Lunan County. The plan is to jointly produce 50,000 tons of pig iron, 200,000 tons of coking coal, and 300 tons of copper this year to meet the needs of industrial development in both counties. Yiliang County will provide two-thirds of the labor and capital required for mining, and Lunan County will provide one-third. Cadres will be jointly transferred from the two counties and used in a unified manner. The two counties also established an industrial cooperation committee to uniformly lead the mining work.

By the beginning of August, nearly 10,000 workers had gathered in the mining area. One hundred and seventy-three indigenous iron smelting furnaces with a daily output of one ton and two small blast furnaces with a daily output of five tons had been built and put into production. Coking coal and copper ore have also begun production.

　　毗邻两县协作开矿
　　宜良不再缺矿产　路南不再缺劳力
    据新华社昆明11日电　云南省路南彝族自治县同宜良县打破县界协作开矿，解决了宜良缺乏资源和路南劳动力资金不足的困难，使两县地方工业共同跃进。
    路南、宜良两县毗邻，但自然条件与经济基础都不相同。路南是山区，矿产资源十分丰富。但是，全县只有五万个劳动力，抽不出大批的人来开采矿产，居民也拿不出许多资金投入开矿。与此相反，宜良县是云南最富饶的农业区之一，全县有二十万人口，劳动力多，但矿产资源却很缺乏。两县由于各有弱点，开始发展地方工业都碰到若干困难。路南最初制订的工业计划中，今年只准备生产三十七吨铁。宜良今年要大力制造农具、机械等，但所需的生铁和焦煤，必须到三百多公里外的富源县去买。
    7月中旬，两县领导人为了自力更生发展钢铁工业，决定互相取长补短，协作在路南县境内开采铁矿、铜矿，计划今年内共同生产生铁五万吨、焦煤二十万吨和三百吨铜，以满足两县工业发展的需要。开矿所需的劳动力和资金，由宜良县出三分之二，路南县出三分之一，干部由两县共同抽调，统一使用。两县并成立了工业协作委员会，统一领导开矿的工作。
    到8月初，矿区已集结了将近一万名工人，有一百七十三座日产一吨的土炼铁炉和两座日产五吨的小高炉已经建成投入生产，焦煤和铜矿也开始生产。
