Khrushchev's Letter to Eisenhower

Dear Mr. President:

I have received your letter of August 1. I fully agree with the view expressed therein that direct communication between heads of government is of great importance. In the current circumstances, such direct communication should serve the main purpose put forward by the people of all countries: to ensure peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

I also agree with your statement that we are now engaged in unusual communication. Please understand me correctly: this unusual communication is the result of the extraordinary measures taken by the United States and the United Kingdom in the Middle East. The United States and the United Kingdom sent their troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, thereby disrupting peace in the region.

In your letter, you mentioned that the United Nations and the Security Council must be requested to assist in resolving the current situation in the Middle East. You are right that the United Nations was born out of the suffering of World War II. Everyone knows that mankind places its hopes for maintaining peace on the work of the United Nations and its Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for maintaining world peace.

It was precisely from recognizing this role of the United Nations that the Soviet government, in the early days of the US-British aggression against Arab countries, proposed to the Security Council the withdrawal of armed intervention troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and the convening of an emergency meeting of the United Nations on this issue. However, the United States, the United Kingdom, and some other members of the current Security Council are obstructing the Security Council from making decisions to normalize the situation in the Middle East. To put it frankly, it should be admitted that it is the policy pursued by the United States, supported by the United Kingdom, and, regrettably, by some other countries, that is undermining this international organization and preventing the Security Council from fulfilling its functions. Examples abound. Did the United States not bypass the Security Council and order its troops to invade Lebanon? Can you deny that the US government, by landing its troops, presented the Security Council with a fait accompli? Can it be said that this action strengthens the United Nations and the Security Council?

If we look at the current members of the Security Council, we must conclude that this institution, under the pressure of the United States, has in fact become a special committee mainly composed of participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, in which the seat rightfully belonging to the great People's Republic of China has been usurped by the political corpse of Chiang Kai-shek's representative.

This policy of ignoring the People's China is unwise. This great country exists, constantly consolidating and developing, regardless of whether some governments recognize it or not. If reason prevails and the People's Republic of China occupies its legitimate seat in the United Nations, this will be duly appreciated by the people of all countries, because the people of all countries understand that the Security Council and the United Nations, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, cannot become truly effective organizations for maintaining peace and ensuring security as required by the United Nations Charter.

Therefore, a situation has arisen in which the Security Council is virtually paralyzed, unable to pass any decision that is not subject to the will of the United States and that truly helps to ensure peace throughout the world.

I do not want to argue with you now. However, I cannot but mention some of the distortions in your letter of Soviet foreign policy and its goals.

For example, the insistence that the Soviet Union imposes its political rule on Eastern European countries. However, this statement is unfounded and, of course, does not surprise us. We have heard this kind of talk more than once from US Secretary of State Dulles. But despite the tireless repetition of this tune, they have not become convincing in the slightest. The people of Eastern European countries have freely chosen their current way of life and will not allow anyone to change it. You have repeatedly stated your support for the people of small countries. But if words and deeds are consistent, then you should in fact recognize the right of all countries to make autonomous decisions and to establish national systems that conform to their interests. But the actual actions are not like this. Whenever a change occurs somewhere that disrupts the order that pleases the US government, you insist that this change is not based on the will of the people, but on the will of others.

But can we close our eyes to the fact that we are living in an era of great revolutionary change, living in an era of the reconstruction of social systems on a new basis? The scale of this wave that occurred in the Soviet Union is now expanding. It swept across China, Eastern European countries, North Korea, and North Vietnam. At the same time, the people of many Asian and African countries who were brutally oppressed by imperialist countries have also gained their national independence in the struggle against domestic and foreign oppressors. The people of a series of other countries on these continents are also engaged in national liberation struggles, and there is no doubt that they will win, and no bayonet of any foreign colonialist can prevent this, because colonialism has reached its end. This is an inevitable historical process, this is the will of the people.

Any country, if it truly wants to care about the independence and security of small countries, has no right to arbitrarily interfere in the affairs of these countries and declare all kinds of "doctrines" for this purpose. So, on what basis does the US government declare a doctrine bearing your name to interfere in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries?

For example, when the people of Lebanon are outraged by the policies of the Lebanese President who has become a servant of the United States instead of a servant of his own people and demand his removal, as soon as this President, who has lost the trust of the people, asks you for help in violation of the Constitution of his own country, the US government immediately mobilizes the Sixth Fleet to send its Marines to Lebanon, where it begins to rectify "order" according to the aforementioned doctrine. The British government led by Mr. Macmillan sent its armed forces to interfere in the internal affairs of Jordan under the pretext of a request from the King of Jordan, who had not received any support from his own people.

In the United States, some people still pride themselves on the fact that the US government interfered in the internal affairs of Guatemala and expelled the legally elected government and president from there. Does this also conform to your so-called concept of caring for small countries and respecting their independence and dignity?

If so, Mr. President, we have different understandings of the rights of the people of small countries. In common political parlance, this action of the US government is called trampling on the rights of the people of small countries, forcing them to submit to itself, and the people of countries whose national independence has been violated by the United States and the United Kingdom are waging a tenacious struggle against this practice.

If we also trace other such facts, then there is much to talk about even without looking at very distant history, just looking at the fact that US troops landed in Cuba not long ago. This would undoubtedly make this letter even longer.

I cannot but mention your assessment of the Middle East events. You said that the Middle East problem is not a problem of American aggression, but a problem of indirect aggression. That is to say, Mr. President, when talking about some kind of indirect aggression, you seem to understand the entry of foreign troops into other countries as a direct act of aggression, just like us and the vast majority of other countries. This is beyond reproach.

Because of this, the whole world justly regards the entry of US troops into Lebanon and the entry of British troops into Jordan as direct aggression. As for the kind of indirect aggression implied in your letter, one cannot but regard the practice of using this unwarranted danger as a pretext as an attempt to cover up the direct aggression of the United States.

Moreover, the nonsense about the so-called indirect aggression threatening Lebanon has been refuted by the two well-known reports submitted by the United Nations Observer Group specially sent to Lebanon by the Security Council.

In this case, Mr. President, we cannot understand what right the US government has to appoint itself as an arbitrator and judge, and insist that some kind of indirect aggression has occurred in Lebanon, obviously because you do not recognize the right of the people of Middle Eastern countries to care for their own destiny and the system of their country on the basis of the interests of the people of these countries. You, Mr. President, are in direct contradiction with what you emphasized about respecting the will, dignity and security of small countries.

The world knows that the internal events that occurred in Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan are an angry expression of the people of these countries against the systems imposed on them by imperialist colonialists. The people of Iraq stood up because they could no longer tolerate the oppression and atrocities of foreign lackeys. Now the United States and other Western countries have recognized the government of the Republic of Iraq. This means that you and your allies, Mr. President, have recognized the right of the Iraqi people to change the original system.

It can be seen from this that your argument about some kind of indirect aggression is unfounded. This argument wants to set aside the real aggression carried out by the United States and the United Kingdom in the Middle East.

We regret that, Mr. President, you do not agree to hold a summit meeting in Moscow and use the Moscow residents' angry demonstrations near the US Embassy against the US armed intervention in Lebanon as a pretext in this regard. This demonstration was a very natural expression of the Soviet people's sympathy for the victims of aggression.

The facts you cited are particularly unconvincing, because the US government itself has so far refused to take measures to ensure normal working conditions for the Soviet mission to the United Nations and has not stopped certain elements from constantly provoking the Soviet mission in New York. Of course, these cannot but affect the emotions of the Soviet people holding demonstrations.

Mr. President, our people were not the first to hold such demonstrations. It would be great if the United States could stop this phenomenon. Our people will give due appreciation.

I would like to point out that our people have a correct assessment of these events. They clearly distinguish the behavior of the hired rogues against the Soviet mission in New York from the true feelings of the American people. We have the most friendly feelings towards the American people and hope to develop extensive cultural and economic ties between our two countries. We hope that the people of our two countries can better understand each other and work together to maintain and consolidate peace, eliminate alienation between countries, and enable all countries to truly live in harmony. The Soviet people's attitude towards the American people is well known. It can be recalled that when those irresponsible elements hired with money from well-known foundations (these foundations were established to carry out subversive activities against countries that did not participate in US-led military blocs) were behaving wildly in front of the Soviet mission in New York, American scientists, experts, athletes, travelers, and the famous American social activist Mr. Stevenson were treated with the usual Soviet cordial hospitality in the Soviet Union.

Now I want to return to the main issue, to the only topic that should be in our current communication, that is, how to take effective measures as soon as possible to eliminate the US-British military intervention in the Middle East.

You believe that the United Nations Security Council must be entrusted to study this issue. Regrettably, as I have already pointed out above, the current situation of the Security Council is that it is actually subordinate to the US foreign policy, and most representatives of the countries in it dare not take actions that are different from the US position. This situation makes us unable to recognize your proposal as correct. The US policy towards the Security Council undermines the possibility of the Security Council taking effective measures to maintain peace and stop aggression. This policy impairs the effectiveness of the Security Council as a tool for peace.

The United Nations and its Security Council are necessary international organizations, and they should reflect the peace-loving aspirations of the people of all countries. However, the US government uses the Security Council for its own selfish interests through the representatives of those military blocs in which the United States occupies a dominant position. The United States is actually trying to make the Security Council a subsidiary agency of the US State Department. How can we close our eyes to the reality, how can we not consider this situation: The Security Council cannot make objective conclusions on the Middle East situation in its current composition.

No, Mr. President, the interests of maintaining world peace and strengthening security require us to adopt a rational attitude so that it is possible to take positive solutions and ensure peace.

Since the initial moment of the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East, the Soviet Union has advocated taking immediate measures to stop the aggression, withdraw foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan, stop the expansion of armed intervention, and eliminate the dangerous tension caused by the actions of the United States and the United Kingdom. To this end, we proposed a summit meeting of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and India, with the participation of UN Secretary-General Mr. Hammarskjöld.

We regret that you and Mr. Macmillan considered it impossible to adopt our proposal. Therefore, the issue of convening a summit meeting of the five countries with the participation of the UN Secretary-General has not been satisfactorily resolved.

Although the US government and the British government made the convening of the five-nation conference impossible and are directly responsible for this, it can now be said with great certainty that the people of all countries demand the immediate convening of this conference to stop the armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and the peace-loving countries are determined to stop the aggression against the Middle East. This has forced the armed interventionists not to expand the aggression to other countries at this stage, primarily the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. Therefore, it is not accidental that Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, had to recognize the Republic of Iraq, while the aggressors initially regarded the birth of the Republic of Iraq as a threat to peace in the Middle East. But this does not mean that the danger of expanding and sharpening the conflict in this region has been eliminated, and the security of the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries has been guaranteed. The troops of the interveners have not yet withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan. In addition, new foreign troops are constantly arriving in this region, and the Baghdad Pact countries are implementing new military measures.

The issue of completely stopping the armed intervention in the Middle East and creating conditions there to protect the people of this region from foreign intervention remains to be urgently resolved. Foreign troops should immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, because their presence there constantly threatens the peace and independence of all countries. This grossly violates the UN Charter, which cannot be tolerated by any member of the United Nations.

In this case, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to continue efforts to maintain and consolidate peace in the Middle East. Since the US government and the British government have refused to convene a summit meeting of the five countries, and the Security Council, as I pointed out earlier, cannot guarantee to solve the Middle East situation in favor of peace, the Soviet government, in order to quickly take the necessary measures to stop the aggression, has instructed its representative to the United Nations to request an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan. The Soviet government hopes that submitting this issue to the United Nations General Assembly, with representatives from large and small countries, for discussion will find a way to eliminate the military danger caused by the actions of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Middle East, and bring peace to this region.

Mr. President, the events in the Middle East put the world at risk of a full-scale war, which would bring countless disasters to the people of all countries. In view of this situation in the Middle East, it is particularly urgent to create conditions for the peaceful coexistence of all countries and eliminate the "Cold War" that poisons the entire international situation. On this point, I think you will agree with me. The Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries are striving for the day when no major country can launch aggression, including aggression against small countries. Aggression by small countries against large countries is simply impossible. Mr. President, small countries do not have as many troops as you said in your letter. We should consider the real conditions and possibilities. It is not the small countries that can provoke a world war, but the large countries that have huge troops, many atomic and hydrogen weapons, many rockets, bombers, and other means of destruction. Therefore, it is precisely the major countries that should reach an agreement not to take steps that push the world to the brink of war disaster.

The Soviet government believes that efforts should be made to develop contacts and ties between government officials of all countries. Direct meetings between leaders of all countries help to ease the existing tensions, promote trust and mutual understanding between countries, and help to melt the ice of the "Cold War" faster. We attach particular importance to this kind of contact. As you know, as early as last December, we proposed convening a meeting of high-level national leaders. We believe that as long as a high-level meeting is held with the participation of the parties we previously proposed, the efforts of all participants in the plenary meeting can find ways and methods to eliminate the "Cold War" state and make the outbreak of a hot war impossible.

Let us make all necessary efforts so that the talks expected by the people of all countries will not be delayed indefinitely. We hope that you can agree to our proposal for a high-level meeting and are willing to increase such meetings at any time. The rapid convening of the highest-level meeting is in the interests of all countries, large and small.

Finally, I hope that the US government will support the proposal to convene an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. This will be a good step to ease the tension and can lay the foundation for accelerating the holding of a high-level meeting.

              Sincerely,

                    N. Khrushchev

              August 5, 1958, in Moscow

### 赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信

1958-08-07
第2版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信尊敬的总统先生：
    我收到了你8月1日的信。我完全同意其中谈到各国政府首脑之间直接的通信有重要意义这种看法。在当前情况下，这种直接通信应该服务于各国人民所提出的主要目的：保证和平和社会制度不同的国家之间的和平共处。
    我还同意你的这种说法：我们现在进行的是不平常的通信。请正确地理解我的意思：这种不平常的通信是美国和英国在中近东采取非常措施的结果。美国和英国派遣自己的军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，从而破坏了这个地区的和平。
    您在信中谈到，必须请求联合国和安全理事会来协助解决中近东的当前局势问题。您说得对，联合国是在第二次世界大战的苦难中诞生的。大家知道，人类把维护和平的愿望寄托在联合国和它的安理会的工作上，安理会对维护世界和平负有主要责任。
    正是从承认联合国的这个作用出发，苏联政府在美英侵略阿拉伯国家的最初日子里就向安理会提出关于武装干涉军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦以及就这个问题召开联合国紧急会议的建议。然而，美国、英国和参加现在的安理会的某些其他理事国却阻碍着安理会作出使中近东局势正常化的决定。如果坦率地说，就应该承认，正是美国所奉行的、并为英国、遗憾的是还有某些其他国家所支持的政策破坏着这个国际组织，使安理会没有履行自己职能的可能性。事例俯拾即是。难道美国不是避开安理会而命令自己的军队侵入黎巴嫩吗？您能否认，美国政府让自己的部队登陆，就使安理会面对既成事实吗？能够说这种行动是巩固联合国和安理会吗？
    如果看一看现在安理会的成员，不得不得出结论，这个机构在美国压力下，实际上变成了主要是由北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约、东南亚条约组织的参加国组成的一种特殊委员会，其中，伟大的中华人民共和国的合法代表的席位被政治僵尸蒋介石的代表所窃据。
    无视人民中国的这种政策是不明智的。这个伟大的国家存在着，不断巩固和发展着，不管某些政府是否承认它。如果理智能占上风，而且中华人民共和国在联合国占有自己的合法席位，这将会得到各国人民应有的评价，因为各国人民都明白，安理会和联合国没有中华人民共和国参加，就不可能像联合国宪章所要求的那样成为维护和平与保障安全的真正有效的组织。
    因此造成了这样的情况：安理会实际上瘫痪了，它不能通过任何不以美国意志为转移的、真正有助于保障全世界和平的决定。
    我现在不想和您争论。但是，我不能不谈一谈您的信中歪曲苏联外交政策及其目标的某些说法。
    例如，硬说苏联把自己的政治统治强加于东欧国家。但是，这种说法是毫无根据的，它当然并没有使我们感到奇怪。我们已经不止一次地在美国国务卿杜勒斯口中听到这一类话。可是，尽管不厌其烦地一再重复这种调子，但它们丝毫没有因而令人信服。东欧国家的人民自由地选定了他们目前的生活方式，并且不允许任何人来改变这种生活方式。你们不止一次地声明你们支持小国的人民。但是如果言行一致的话，那么你们就应该在事实上承认各国人民有权作出自主的决定，有权建立符合他们利益的国家制度。可是实际行动却不是这样。每当什么地方发生了变革，会破坏合乎美国政府心意的秩序时，你们便硬说这种变革不是根据人民的意志、而是根据别人的意志进行的。
    可是我们难道能闭着眼睛不看看，我们是生活在伟大的革命变革时代，生活在社会制度在新的基础上改建的时代吗。这种在苏联发生的浪潮的规模现在正在日益扩大。它席卷了中国、东欧国家、朝鲜北部、越南北部。同时，过去受到帝国主义国家残酷压迫的许多亚非国家的人民，也在同国内外压迫者进行斗争中获得了自己的民族独立。这些大陆的其他一系列国家的人民也正在进行民族解放斗争，毫无疑问，他们会取得胜利，任何外国殖民主义者的刺刀都不能阻挠这一点，因为殖民主义已经到了末日。这是无法避免的历史进程，这是人民的意志。
    任何国家，如果真正愿意关心小国的独立和安全，就无权妄自干涉这些国家的事务并为此而宣布形形色色的“主义”。那末，美国政府究竟是根据什么来宣布带着您的名字的主义，来干涉中近东国家的事务呢？
    例如，黎巴嫩人民对成为美国仆人而没有成为本国人民仆人的黎巴嫩总统的政策感到愤慨，要求罢免他，这时，只消这位失去人民信任的总统违背本国宪法向你们求救，美国政府就立刻调动第六舰队，把它的陆战队投到黎巴嫩去，在那里根据上述主义开始整顿“秩序”了。麦克米伦先生所领导的英国政府借口没有得到本国人民的任何支持的约旦国王的请求，就派自己的武装部队去干涉约旦的内政。
    在美国，有些人至今还对美国政府曾干涉危地马拉内政、把合法当选的政府和总统从那里驱逐走这件事引以为荣。难道这也符合你们所谓的关心小国、尊重它们的独立和尊严的概念吗？
    如果这样，总统先生，我们对小国人民的权利就有不同的理解。用通用的政治语言来讲，美国政府的这种行动叫做蹂躏小国人民的权利，强迫它们屈服于自己，而本国独立遭到美国和英国侵犯的各国人民正在进行顽强的斗争反对这种做法。
    如果也追溯一下其他这样的事实，那末，甚至不必翻阅很远的历史，只需看看不久前美军在古巴登陆这一事实，就有许多可以谈的，这一来，这封信无疑就要写得更长了。
    我不能不谈您对中近东事件的估计。您说，中东问题不是美国侵略问题，而是间接侵略问题。这就是说，您，总统先生，在谈到某种间接侵略时，看来同我们和绝大多数其他国家一样，是把外国军队开入别国境内理解为直接侵略行动的。这一点是无可非议的。
    正因为如此，全世界都公正地把美国军队开入黎巴嫩和英国军队开入约旦看作直接侵略。至于谈到您的来信中所暗示的某种间接侵略，那就不能不把以拿这种莫须有的危险作为借口的作法看作是企图掩盖美国的直接侵略的手法。
    况且，关于所谓威胁黎巴嫩的间接侵略的一派胡言，已经被安全理事会特地派到黎巴嫩去的联合国观察团所提出的两份大家都知道的报告所驳倒了。
    在这种情况下，总统先生，我们不能理解美国政府有什么权利自封为仲裁人和法官，并且硬说黎巴嫩发生了某种间接侵略，很明显，那是因为你们不承认中近东各国人民有权利在符合这些国家人民利益的基础上关怀自己的命运和本国的制度。您，总统先生，在这方面同您所强调的要尊重小国的意愿、尊严和安全的说法发生了直接的矛盾。
    全世界知道，黎巴嫩、伊拉克和约旦所发生的内部事件是这些国家的人民反对帝国主义殖民主义者强加在他们头上的制度的愤怒表现。伊拉克人民站起来了，因为他们再也不能容忍外国的走狗们的压迫和胡作非为了。现在美国和其他西方国家承认了伊拉克共和国政府。这就是说，您和您的盟国，总统先生，已承认伊拉克人民有权利改变原来的制度。
    由此可见，您关于某种间接侵略的论调是毫无根据的，这种论调想把美英两国在中近东所进行的真正侵略撇到一旁。
    我们很遗憾，总统先生，您不同意在莫斯科举行政府首脑会议，并且以莫斯科居民曾经在美国大使馆附近举行反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的群情激愤的示威来作为这方面的借口。这个示威运动是苏联人民同情侵略的牺牲者的一种极其自然的表现。
    您们引用的事实尤其不能令人信服的是，因为美国政府本身到现在为止，一直拒绝采取措施来保证苏联驻联合国代表处以正常工作的条件，并且没有制止某些分子在纽约对苏联代表处的经常不断的挑衅行为，当然这些不能不影响到举行示威游行的苏联人的情绪。
    总统先生，首先举行这种示威游行的不是我国人民。如果美国能制止这种现象，那是很好的。我国人民将会给予应有的估价。
    我想指出，我国人民对这些事件有正确的估价，他们把受雇的流氓反对苏联驻纽约代表处的行为同美国人民的真正感情很好地区别开来。我们对美国人民怀着最友好的感情，并且渴望我们两国之间发展广泛的文化和经济联系。我们希望我们两国人民能够更好地彼此了解，共同努力来维护和巩固和平、消除各国之间疏远的情况、使所有的国家都能真正和睦相处。苏联人对美国人民的态度大家知道得很清楚。可以回顾一下，当那些用人所共知的基金（这种基金的设立是为了对那些没有参加美国起领导作用的军事集团的国家进行颠复活动）的钱雇用的不负责任的分子在苏联驻纽约代表处前面胡作非为的时候，美国的科学家、专家、运动员、旅行家、以及美国有名的社会活动家史蒂文森先生都在苏联受到苏联人惯有的亲切好客的招待。
    现在我想回到主要的问题上来，回到应该成为当前我们通信中唯一的主题上来，即如何尽快地采取有效措施来消除美英在中近东的军事干涉。
    您认为，必须委托联合国安全理事会来研究这个问题。遗憾的是，正如我上面所已经指出的，目前安理会的处境是，它实际上从属于美国的外交政策，而其中各国多数代表又不敢采取同美国立场不同的做法，这种情况使我们不能承认您的建议是正确的。美国对待安理会的政策破坏安理会采取有效措施维护和平和制止侵略的可能性。这种政策有损于安理会作为和平工具的效力。
    联合国和它的安理会是必要的国际组织，它们应该体现各国人民的爱好和平的愿望。然而美国政府却通过美国在其中占统治地位的那些军事集团的参加国的代表利用安理会为它的自私自利的利益服务。美国实际上力图使安理会沦为美国国务院的附属机构。怎么能够闭眼不看现实状况，怎么能够不考虑到这个情况：安理会在目前这种组成的状况下不能够就中近东局势问题作出客观的结论。
    不，总统先生，维护世界和平和加强安全的利益要求我们采取理智的态度，以便有可能采取积极的解决办法和确保和平。
    自从美英武装干涉中近东的最初时刻起，苏联就主张立即采取措施制止侵略、使外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，制止扩大武装干涉和消除由于美英两国的行动而造成的危险的紧张局面。为此，我们建议召开有联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议。
    我们感到遗憾的是，您和麦克米伦先生都认为不可能采纳我们的这项建议，因此，关于召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议的问题没有得到圆满解决。
    虽然美国政府和英国政府使五国会议的召开成为不可能并对此负直接责任，但是，现在可以十分肯定地说，各国人民要求立即召开这种会议以停止对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，爱好和平的国家决心制止对中近东的侵略，这些就迫使武装干涉者在现阶段没有把侵略扩大到其他国家，首先是伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国。因此，西方国家，其中包括美国和英国，不得不承认伊拉克共和国，这并不是偶然的，而当初侵略者曾把伊拉克共和国的诞生看作是对中近东和平的威胁。但是这并不是说，在这一地区冲突扩大和尖锐化的危险已经消除，伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的安全得到了保障。干涉者的军队直到现在尚没有撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。此外，新的外国军队不断地开到这个地区，巴格达条约各国正在实行着新的军事措施。
    关于彻底停止对中近东的武装干涉和在那里创造条件使这一地区人民免受外国干涉的问题仍然急待解决。外国军队应当立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，因为他们驻扎在那里，就经常威胁着各国人民的和平和独立。这极其粗暴地破坏联合国宪章，联合国的任何一个会员国都不能对此容忍。
    在这情况下，苏联政府认为必须继续努力以维护和巩固中近东的和平。既然美国政府和英国政府拒绝召开五国政府首脑会议，而安全理事会，正如我前面所指出的，又不能保证解决中近东局势问题以利于和平，因此，苏联政府为了迅速采取必要措施制止侵略，已指示自己的驻联合国代表要求召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美国军队撤出黎巴嫩、英国军队撤出约旦的问题。苏联政府希望，把这个问题提交有大国和小国代表参加的联合国大会讨论，就能找到办法来消除美英两国在中近东的行动所造成的军事危险。给这个地区带来安宁。
    总统先生，中近东事件使世界面临全面大战的危险，而大战将会给各国人民带来无数灾难，鉴于中东这种局势，目前显得特别迫切需要为各国和平共处创造条件，消除毒化整个国际局势的“冷战”。在这一点上，我想您是会和我持同样意见的。苏联和一切爱好和平的国家竭力争取有一天能做到没有一个大国能发动侵略，其中包括对小国的侵略。小国对大国的侵略根本不可能。总统先生，小国没有您在来信中说的那么许多部队。我们应当考虑现实的条件和可能性。能够挑起世界大战的不是小国，而是拥有庞大的部队、很多原子武器和氢武器、拥有很多火箭、轰炸机和其他毁灭手段的大国。因此正是各大国应当达成协议，彼此不要采取把世界推向战争灾难边缘的步骤。
    苏联政府认为，应当竭力发展各国政府人士的接触和联系。各国领导人的直接会见有助于缓和现存的紧张局势，促进各国之间的信任和互相谅解，有助于更快地融化“冷战”的冰雪。我们特别重视这种接触，您也知道，早在去年12月，我们就建议召开高级国家领导人会议。我们相信，只要举行有我们过去建议的方面参加的高级会议，那么在全体会议参加者的努力下，就能找到消除“冷战”状态的途径和方法，使热战的爆发成为不可能。
    让我们尽一切必要的努力，使各国人民所期待着的会谈不致无止境地拖延下去。我们希望您能同意我们的关于高级会议的建议，并且愿意随时增加这样的会议。迅速召开最高级会议，是符合大大小小一切国家的利益的。
    最后，我希望美国政府支持关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议，这将是一个缓和紧张局势的良好步骤，并且可以为加速举行高级会议奠定基础。
              此致
    敬意
                    尼·赫鲁晓夫
              1958年8月5日于莫斯科
