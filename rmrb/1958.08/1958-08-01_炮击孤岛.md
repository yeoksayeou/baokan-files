    Shelling a Lone Island
    Hā Huá
    This spring was not only a time of gentle breezes and warm sunshine for our troops, but also one of intense combat. Every officer and soldier displayed the same vigor as in the war years, training day and night. The sounds of artillery and gunfire filled the air, creating a tense atmosphere of combat. Encouraged by the great leap forward situation, our amphibious tank unit proposed completing three years of training syllabus in six months. The result of the first company's rifle shooting test was a perfect score of one hundred hits out of one hundred shots, earning a reputation throughout the entire garrison area. Everyone's eyes were filled with smiles, and their hearts were full of joy and excitement.
    In particular, Marshal Zhu De visited our troops and instructed everyone that pampered soldiers cannot win battles. Therefore, we must cultivate the spirit of hardship and heroism in every soldier, and foster the noble, pure, and upright moral qualities of a national defense soldier. We spent the spring in intense combat training.
    Now, in the blink of an eye, it is already summer, with the sound of cicadas filling our ears. One day, we were conducting river driving training, and amphibious tanks were advancing rapidly in formation along the river. Suddenly, we saw many military jeeps appear on the road, kicking up a trail of dust. One jeep stopped abruptly in front of us, and our deputy division commander jumped out of the car, saying cheerfully:
    "Deputy Commander Xu Shiyou and many staff officers have come to see you."
    "Is there a mission?" Political Commissar Kuang Wei asked quickly.
    "I heard that your first company scored one hundred hits out of one hundred shots in the rifle test, so they came to see it specifically. They want you to drive the amphibious tanks to the sea and shell a lone island, to see if it's real skill." The deputy division commander, who came from a "little red devil" background during the civil war, always spoke with well-intentioned humor.
    "They are all novices and haven't fired artillery before!" Regiment Commander Wang Ziyu said quickly.
    "It doesn't matter, as long as the shells don't fly away like sparrows, disappearing without a trace."
    The regiment commander and political commissar immediately told the young men the news, and everyone was both happy and worried. They were happy that the leaders were personally watching their live-fire exercise, and worried because the old tank soldiers had almost all left after their terms of service expired, and they were all novices who had never fired live ammunition before.
    The tank crews quickly made preparations for going to sea: the commander checked various components, the driver put on the tank helmet, the mechanic checked the communication equipment, and the gunner cleaned the gun and installed the sight. The young men were both nervous and serious, standing by in battle readiness.
    The commander issued the order to go to sea. The amphibious tanks drove over the mudflats on the beach and began to accelerate in formation across the sea, the calm sea surface being carved with countless straight ripples, gradually expanding and then disappearing.
    Through the binoculars, we saw the craggy lone island. It was surrounded by white clouds and mist, and it looked as if it were made of crystal in the sunlight. Gentle waves gently caressed it, splashing countless tiny silver bubbles, shimmering with white light.
    The lone island was getting closer and closer. In the command tank, the commander fired signal flares into the sky, the glittering red and green flashing in the azure sky. The commander immediately issued the firing data, shouting in a strong voice:
    "Elevation twenty, target directly ahead..."
    The command tank fired the first shell first, using the impact point of the first shell as the target. All the tanks on the sea fired with deafening roars, and the shells flew whistling towards the target. Flames burst and smoke billowed on the rocks of the craggy lone island.
    The new gunners were very nervous. Seeing Deputy Commander Xu Shiyou raising his binoculars on the head of the bay mountain, and the staff officers observing on the flat car on the sea, knowing they were watching their shooting skills, their hearts couldn't help but beat like a small deer. The company instructor immediately encouraged:
    "Composure is confidence. Calm down, and your heart will stop racing."
    The gunners began to calm down, and then a barrage of artillery fire roared, and the shells pounded the target. The artillery fire broke the tranquility of the sea, and the lone island reef was completely shrouded in smoke and fire, becoming invisible.
    After the shooting was completed, the commander ordered a return.
    At this time, dusk had already arrived. It was high tide, the sea breeze began to howl, the entire sea began to rage, and the waves were surging. Several fiery clouds hung in the gray sky, flashing with colorful light. The lone island gradually turned into a dark shadow and then disappeared. The amphibious tanks maintained their formation, braving the wind and waves to return to the beach.
    A few days later, Deputy Commander Xu Shiyou made a long-distance call from Nanjing:
    "The live-fire exercise was very good, don't be proud, keep working hard!"

    炮击孤岛
    哈华
    今年的春天，对我们部队来说，不仅是风和日暖，而是紧张战斗。每个指战员拿出战争年月里的干劲来，夜以继日的展开大练兵。整天炮声隆隆，枪声不绝于耳，充满了紧张的战斗气氛。我们水陆两栖坦克部队，为保卫社会主义祖国的美好生活，为大跃进的形势所鼓舞，提出三年的训练科目六个月完成。一连外膛枪射击测验的结果，全部百发百中，驰誉全警备区。每个人眼睛含着笑，内心充满了快乐和激动。
    特别是朱德元帅来看望过我们部队，指示大家说，娇兵是不能打胜仗的。因此，我们要培养每个战士艰苦、英勇的精神，培养作为国防军人那种崇高的纯洁明朗道德品质。我们是紧张战斗中渡过春天。
    现在，转眼已经是蝉声满耳的夏季了，有一天，我们又进行河川驾驶的教练，水陆两栖坦克列队在河道里迅速前进着；掀起银花雪浪。突然，望见公路上出现许多军用吉普车，扬起一溜尘烟。一辆吉普车到我们面前突然煞住了，从车上跳出我们的副师长，拉开快活的声音就说：
    “许世友副司令员和许多参谋人员来看你们了。”
    “有什么任务吧！”政委邝威忙问。
    “听说你们一连外膛枪测验全部百发百中，特别赶来看看。要你们把水陆两栖坦克开到海上去，炮击孤岛，看是不是真功夫。”副师长是内战时期的小红鬼出身，说话总是带着好意的幽默。
    “他们全是新手，还没有打过炮呢！”团长王子玉忙说。
    “没关系，只要炮弹不要像麻雀一样，呼一家伙飞得不见了就行喽。”
    团长和政委立刻把这消息告诉小伙子们，个个又欢喜又担心。欢喜的是，首长亲自来看他们实弹射击，担心的是，因为老的坦克兵服役期满，差不多都走掉了，全是新手，没有实弹射击过。
    坦克手们很快做好出海的准备：车长检查了各种部件，驾驶员带上了坦克帽，机电员检查了通话设备，炮手擦好炮，装上瞄准镜。小伙子们又紧张又严肃，严阵以待。
    指挥员下达了出海的命令，水陆两栖坦克走过海边的泥滩，开始列队加速在海面前进，平静如镜的海面，被划起无数直直的波纹，渐渐扩大开去，又消失了。
    在了望镜里，望见了嶙峋的孤岛。它为白云和雾霭所缭绕，在阳光下好像水晶凝成一般。柔波轻轻的抚摩着它，溅起无数细碎的银色泡沫，闪烁着白色的光辉。
    孤岛越来越近了。在指挥坦克里，指挥员向天空射出了信号弹，熠熠红绿闪光在蔚蓝的天空辐射。车长立刻下达了射击诸元，强有力的声音喊到：
    “表尺二十，目标正前方……”
    指挥坦克首先射击第一发炮弹，以第一发炮弹弹着点为目标，海面上所有的坦克响起了震耳欲聋的炮声，炮弹对着目标飞啸而去。只见嶙峋孤岛的礁石上，火光飞迸，硝烟迷漫。
    新的炮手很紧张，一看在海湾山头上的许世友副司令员举起了望远镜，在海面平车上进行观察的参谋人员对着了望镜了望，知道是看他们射击技术如何？由不得心像小鹿一样乱撞。连指导员立刻鼓励说：
    “沉着就是信心。静一下气，心就不跳了。”
    炮手们开始冷静下来，接着群炮轰鸣，炮弹向目标捶击。炮声打破了海面的宁静，孤岛礁山完全为烽烟所笼罩，看不见了。
    射击完毕，指挥员下令返航。
    这时，黄昏已经袭来了。正是涨潮的时候，海风开始呼啸，全海开始震怒，海波汹涌。灰色的天幕上，停着几块火烧云，闪灼着五彩霞光。孤岛渐渐变成一幢黑影然后消失了。水陆两栖坦克保持着队形，乘风破浪回到了海滨。
    过了几天，许世友副司令员从南京打来长途电话：
    “实弹射击很好，不要骄傲，继续努力！”
