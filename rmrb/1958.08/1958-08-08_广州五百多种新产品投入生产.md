Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th August: Guangzhou workers have been exhausting all means to put new products into production as quickly as possible. According to preliminary statistics from the Municipal Planning Commission, among the more than 1,500 new products (including new varieties) successfully trial-produced in Guangzhou this year, over 500 have been officially put into production.

	The more than 500 new products that have been put into production are mostly urgently needed by society. Among them, the steel industry has more than ten types, including tool steel, silicon steel, high carbon steel, medium carbon steel, and low carbon steel. The electromechanical industry has ninety-six types, including the Zhujiang No. 27 tractor, 1,000 mm screw pumps, hemp stripping machines, and ball bearings. The hardware and building materials industry has sixty-one types, including lathes, motors, and drilling machines. The chemical industry has one hundred and fifty-five types, including bacterial fertilizers, mercuric oxide, and mercuric chloride. In the light industry, there are various products serving consumers, such as air battery lamps, portable radios, microporous rubber-soled slippers, and seamless flashlights.

	The reason why new products can be quickly put into production is that many factories have promoted the spirit of communist cooperation, supporting and cooperating with each other. In July, Xinhua Electric Motor Factory successfully trial-produced a blower, but when it was officially put into production, it lacked more than 400 kilograms of one-centimeter-thick steel plates. After the leading cadres of Taian Factory and Rong'an Factory learned of this situation, they squeezed out some of their own steel plates to help the brother factory solve the major difficulty of putting the new product into production.

    广州五百多种新产品投入生产
    据新华社广州7日电  广州工人想尽办法，使新产品尽速投入生产。据市计划委员会的初步统计，今年以来广州市试制成功的一千五百多种新产品（包括新品种）中，有五百多种已经正式投入生产。
    已投入生产的五百多种新产品，绝大部分是社会迫切需要的。其中钢铁工业有工具钢、矽钢、高炭钢、中炭钢、低炭钢等十多种。机电工业有珠江二十七型拖拉机、一千公厘螺浆泵、剥麻机、滚珠轴承等九十六种。五金建材工业有车床、马达、钻床等六十一种。化学工业有细菌肥料、氧化汞、氯化汞等一百五十五种。轻工业方面有空气电池灯、手提收音机、微孔胶底拖鞋、无缝电筒等多种为消费者服务的产品。
    许多工厂发扬共产主义协作精神，互相支援配合，是使新产品能够迅速投入生产的原因。新华电机厂7月间试制成功鼓风机，但正式投入生产时缺乏四百多公斤一分厚的钢板。泰安厂、荣安厂的领导干部知道这一情况后，便把自己的一些钢板挤出来，帮助兄弟厂解决了新产品投入生产的大困难。
