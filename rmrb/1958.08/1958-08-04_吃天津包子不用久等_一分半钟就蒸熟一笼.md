    No More Long Wait for Tianjin Buns
    A Basket Steamed in One and a Half Minutes

    Recently, customers going to Tianjin's famous state-owned bun shop (formerly Goubuli Bun Shop) don't have to wait long to eat hot, freshly steamed buns. This is because the staff of this bun shop have replaced the old steamers with newly created "all-purpose steamers."

    The "all-purpose steamer" is a square steamer. It has six drawer-like tiers that can be freely pulled out or installed, and each tier holds twenty more buns than the old round tiers. At the same time, when the buns are cooked or a new tier of buns is steamed, it is not necessary to take the entire steamer down as in the past, which not only reduces the labor of the chef but also prevents the heat from escaping. Therefore, each tier of buns can be steamed in only one and a half minutes, while in the past it took at least four minutes. (Attached picture)

    吃天津包子不用久等
    一分半钟就蒸熟一笼
    最近，顾客到天津著名的国营包子铺（前狗不理包子铺）去吃包子，不用等候多久就能吃上热腾腾的包子。这是由于这个包子铺的职工，用新创造的“万能笼屉”代替了旧的笼屉的缘故。
    “万能笼屉”是一个正方形的蒸笼。它有六层像抽屉似的能够随意抽出或安上的笼屉，每屉比旧式圆屉多装二十个包子。同时，包子熟了时或新蒸一屉包子，不必像过去一样，必须把整个笼屉端下来，不仅减轻了厨师的劳动，还可以防止热气跑掉，因此每屉包子只用一分半钟就可蒸熟，而过去最快也要四分钟。（附图片）
