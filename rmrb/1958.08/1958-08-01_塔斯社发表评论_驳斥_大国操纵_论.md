Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st: TASS commentator Borisov writes: Currently, some American newspapers are issuing cries, evidently instigated by ruling circles, claiming that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of the heads of government of five powers seems to be "advocating great power manipulation of the world," and that the purpose of this proposal is for the five major powers to decide everything themselves without going through the United Nations.

However, this new "argument" will hardly deceive anyone. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of the heads of government of the five powers does not mean ignoring the United Nations, because: first, the proposal stipulates that the United Nations Secretary-General should participate in the meeting; second, the proposal stipulates that the recommendations put forward during the meeting will be submitted to a Security Council meeting with the participation of representatives of Arab countries for review. To put it bluntly, it is precisely the United States and Britain that have disregarded the United Nations. They have colluded behind the United Nations' back and launched unwarranted aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and then obstructed the Security Council from making effective resolutions to stop the aggression.

As for the claim that advocating a meeting of the heads of government of the five powers is "advocating great power manipulation of the world," then a question must be asked: why do those who hold this view not think of this when the (US, Britain, and France) three major powers have met more than once to discuss interfering in the internal affairs of other countries for their own imperialist aggressive interests? Why is holding such a meeting of the three major powers not "great power manipulation," while convening a meeting of the five major powers to seek ways to extinguish the flames of war in the Middle East is, on the contrary, "great power manipulation"?

Obviously, the propagandists in Washington will not succeed in using this absurd argument to numb the vigilance of the people of all countries who are concerned about quickly stopping the American and British aggression. World opinion expects the United States and Britain to stop playing tricks and equivocating, but to respond positively to suggestions aimed at a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict.

    驳斥“大国操纵”论
    据新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：塔斯社评论员波里索夫写道：现在，一些美国报纸发出了显然是统治集团教唆的叫嚷，说什么苏联关于召开五国政府首脑会议的建议似乎是“主张大国操纵世界”，说这项建议的目的是为了不通过联合国而由五大国自行决定一切。
    但是，这种新的“论点”是很难欺骗任何人的。谁都知道，苏联关于召开五大国政府首脑会议的建议绝不意味着无视联合国，因为：第一，这个建议规定，联合国秘书长参加这次会议；第二，这项建议规定，在这次会议期间提出的建议将提交有阿拉伯国家的代表参加的安全理事会会议审查。如果把话说穿，那就恰恰是美国和英国没有把联合国放在眼里。它们背着联合国狼狈为奸，无端对黎巴嫩和约旦发动了侵略，然后又阻挠安全理事会作出有效的决议来制止侵略。
    至于说主张举行五大国政府首脑会议就是“主张大国操纵世界”，那么，人们就会提出一个问题：为什么在（美、英、法）三大国不止一次地开会商讨为了自己的帝国主义侵略利益而干涉别国内政的时候，持这种说法的人就想不到这一点？为什么举行这种三大国会议不是“大国操纵”，而为了谋求扑灭中东战火的途径召开五大国会议，就反而是“大国操纵”？
    显然，华盛顿的宣传家们用这种荒谬的论点来麻痹关心尽快地制止美英侵略的各国人民的警惕，这种作法是不会成功的。世界舆论期待美英两国的，不再玩弄鬼计和支吾搪塞，而是对目的在和平解决中近东冲突的建议作出积极的反应。
