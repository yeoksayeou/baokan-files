Xinhua News Agency, August 31st. TASS, Moscow, August 30th: TASS issued a statement regarding the so-called Baghdad Pact Council's London meeting, condemning the London meeting as a gathering of conspirators, and exposing their plot to launch a new aggression against Arab countries, especially the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq. The statement said that after armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, the United States and Britain are now colluding with their Baghdad Pact accomplices to plan further expansion of aggression.

The statement emphasized that there is no doubt that if the aggression planned by the Baghdad Pact participating countries against the freedom-loving people of Iraq who are defending their just cause is realized, the peace-loving people of other countries will rise up to aid the invaded country.

The statement exposed the specific deployments that the United States, Britain, and the Baghdad Pact member states are preparing to expand their aggression. The statement pointed out that the United States military is continuing to advance into Lebanon. More than seventy warships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet are patrolling near the coast of Lebanon. More than 150 U.S. military aircraft have been concentrated in the Adana region of Turkey, only a few minutes' flight from the Syrian border of the United Arab Republic. Turkish troops are rapidly moving towards the border of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic and are gathering on the Iraqi border. Iran is also calling up reserves and mobilizing large numbers of troops. British troops are also gathering in the Persian Gulf region south of Iraq. British troops have already landed in the emirates of Lahej, Kuwait, and Oman. Israel openly supports the Western countries' aggressive measures and is implementing mobilization measures.

In view of the above, the TASS statement said that it must remind the governments of the Baghdad Pact participating countries that the United States and British governments, as well as the ruling cliques of the Baghdad Pact participating countries that follow the policies of imperialist countries, must bear full responsibility for the further spread of aggression and all the consequences arising therefrom.

    塔斯社揭露巴格达集团伦敦会议的实质
    一群阴谋家策划新战争
    爱好和平的各国人民将奋起援助被侵略的国家
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：塔斯社就所谓巴格达条约理事会伦敦会议发表声明，谴责伦敦会议是一群阴谋家的集会，揭露他们阴谋对阿拉伯国家、首先是阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国发动新的侵略。声明说，美英两国在武装干涉了黎巴嫩和约旦之后，现在又同它们巴格达条约的同谋者策划进一步扩大侵略。
    声明强调说，毫无疑问，如果巴格达条约参加国所策划的对捍卫自己正义事业的爱好自由的伊拉克人民的侵略一旦实现，那么其他爱好和平的各国人民将奋起援助被侵略的国家。
    声明揭露了美英两国和巴格达条约成员国正在准备扩大侵略的具体部署。声明指出，美国军队正在继续开进黎巴嫩。美国第六舰队的七十多艘军舰在黎巴嫩沿岸附近巡逻。在土耳其离叙利亚国境只有几分钟飞机航程的亚达那地区集中了一百五十多架美国军用飞机。土耳其军队正在急速开往阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的边境，并在伊拉克边境集结。伊朗也在召集后备军，并且调动大批部队。英国军队也在伊拉克以南波斯湾地区集结。英国军队已经在拉赫杰、科威特和阿曼等酋长国登陆。以色列明目张胆地支持西方国家的侵略措施，并在实行动员措施。
    鉴于上述情况，塔斯社声明说，不能不提醒巴格达条约参加国政府注意，美国和英国政府以及那些追随帝国主义国家政策的巴格达条约参加国的统治集团，要对侵略的进一步蔓延和由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任。（塔斯社声明全文见第三版）
