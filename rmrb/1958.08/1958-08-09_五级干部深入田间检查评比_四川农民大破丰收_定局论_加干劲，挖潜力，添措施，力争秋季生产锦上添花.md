    **Five-Level Cadres Go Deep into the Fields for Inspection and Comparison; Sichuan Peasants Shatter the "Fixed Harvest" Theory**
    *Increase Efforts, Tap Potential, Add Measures, and Strive to Add Flowers to the Brocade in Autumn Production*
    (Our dispatch) After Sichuan Province thoroughly smashed complacent and slackening thoughts such as the "fixed harvest theory" and the "contentment theory," a new production upsurge aimed at achieving an even greater autumn harvest has unfolded throughout the province. While concentrating efforts on strengthening the field management of major spring crops, the broad masses of peasants have also decided to utilize the period before the sowing of minor spring crops to plant an additional ten million mu of late autumn crops. The slogans put forward by various localities are: Increase efforts again, tap potential again, add measures again, raise targets again, strive to add flowers to the brocade, and double the completion of this year's production increase plan.
    This year, Sichuan's minor spring crops and early rice have achieved unprecedented harvests. Currently, over thirty million mu of intermediate rice is growing better than in any previous year; the more than ten million mu of late rice that has already been transplanted is developing normally; cotton, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and other crops are also growing vigorously. Various localities expect that these crops will greatly exceed the original targets. In this situation of successive bumper harvests, some cadres and masses have developed a sense of pride and complacency, and their work has become slack and weary. They believe that "a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion" and "increasing production is a sure thing." From now on, they think they can overfulfill the plan even without working, and can "sit and wait for the harvest"; some even think that "they have been busy enough, and the production increase is already enough, so they should take a few days off." Due to the influence of this erroneous thinking, many places have relaxed field management work. According to investigations, about 10% to 15% of the intermediate rice in various localities is in the third category of seedlings and urgently needs remedial measures; there are many instances of missing seedlings and insufficient fertilizer in late rice; and the work of applying additional fertilizer during the peak flowering period of cotton has not been done in most areas.
    After discovering the above situation, Party committees at all levels immediately took effective measures. Nanchong, Neijiang, and other regions organized production inspection groups of 100,000 to 200,000 people respectively to conduct large-scale inspections and comparisons. Cadres at the five levels of region, county, district, township, and commune converged in the fields. By comparing enthusiasm, comparing measures, checking seedling stands, and checking for loopholes, they helped the masses recognize the harm of complacency, thereby promoting the current production movement. After inspection and comparison, the agricultural cooperatives in Guang'an County discovered that there was still a great potential to be tapped and that production was not a foregone conclusion. They immediately added ten measures and raised the original grain production increase target by another 50%. The method of "seeing a doctor in the field, prescribing the right medicine, and taking it immediately" was widely adopted in various counties of the Luzhou region, and the results were also very significant. Many agricultural cooperatives originally believed that this year's late rice was planted early and densely, and that the base fertilizer was sufficient, so there would be no problem with a bumper harvest. Therefore, they did not pay attention to field management. After checking the fields one by one, various localities generally found that late rice was lacking seedlings and fertilizer, and that the rice stem borer was particularly serious, which came as a great shock. People became vigilant, and those who wanted to rest stopped resting. In order to strengthen the field management of major spring crops, Wenjiang, Nanchong, and other regions also promoted a system of assigning special personnel to be responsible to the end. Beiyuan Township in Nanbu County organized more than 500 "thousand-jin fighters," each of whom was specially responsible for managing one to two mu, living in sheds built next to the fields, and guarding the crops day and night.
    After the complacency was reversed, a vigorous movement to increase the planting of one season of late autumn crops was also launched in various places. It is estimated that the increased planting of late autumn crops throughout the province can increase grain production by two to three billion jin.

### 五级干部深入田间检查评比  四川农民大破丰收“定局论”  加干劲，挖潜力，添措施，力争秋季生产锦上添花

    五级干部深入田间检查评比  四川农民大破丰收“定局论”
    加干劲，挖潜力，添措施，力争秋季生产锦上添花
    本报讯  四川各地大破“定局论”、“知足论”等自满松劲思想后，一个力争秋季更大丰收的新的生产高潮已在全省展开。广大农民在集中力量加强大春作物田间管理的同时，还决定利用小春播种前这段时间，再增种一千多万亩晚秋作物。各地提出的口号是：再加干劲、再挖潜力、再添措施、再提指标，力争锦上添花，加倍完成今年增产计划。
    今年四川小春作物和早稻都获得空前丰收。目前三千多万亩中稻又比任何一年都长得好；已栽插的一千多万亩晚稻，发蔸转蔚正常；棉花、红苕、甘蔗等也长得很旺盛，各地预计这些作物都将大大超过原定指标。在这丰收接丰收的情况下，部分干部和群众产生了骄傲自满情绪，工作松劲疲沓起来。他们认为“丰收已成定局”、“增产十拿九稳”，从现在起不工作也能超额完成计划，可以“坐等丰收”了；有的还认为“忙够了，增产的也够多了，该歇几天了”。由于这种错误思想的影响，不少地方放松了田间管理工作。据调查，各地中稻约有10％至15％的三类苗急待补救；晚稻缺窝、缺肥现象很多；棉花盛花期增施追肥工作大部未做。
    各级党委在发现了以上情况后，立即采取了有效措施。南充、内江等专区分别组织了十万到二十万人的生产检查团进行评比大检查，地、县、区、乡、社五级干部会师田间，通过比干劲、比措施、查苗架、查漏洞，帮助群众认清了自满情绪的危害，从而推动了当前的生产运动。广安县农业社在检查评比后，发现可挖的潜力仍然很大，生产并未定局，马上增添了十项措施，把原订的粮食增产指标再提高50％。泸州专区各县普遍采用“田间看病，对症开方、马上吃药”的办法，收效也很显著。许多农业社原来认为今年晚稻栽得又早又密，底肥也足，丰收没有问题，因而不重视田间管理，经过逐田查看，各地普遍发现晚稻缺窝、缺肥，特别是螟害很严重，这才大吃一惊。人们都警惕起来，想歇气的人也不歇气了。为了加强大春作物的田间管理，温江、南充等专区还推行了专人负责制度，指定专人包干到底。南部县碑院乡组织了五百多名“千斤战斗员”，每人专门管理一亩至两亩，在田边搭棚居住，日夜守望庄稼。
    在自满情绪扭转后，各地还热火朝天地展开了增种一季晚秋作物运动。全省预计增种的晚秋作物，可增收粮食二、三十亿斤。
