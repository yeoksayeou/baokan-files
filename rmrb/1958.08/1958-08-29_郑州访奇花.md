Visiting a Rare Flower in Zhengzhou
　　Yang Changfeng, Liu Ye
　　The early autumn days bring a pleasant scene to Nanyang Road in Zhengzhou City. The sycamore and pagoda trees, the hibiscus and canna lilies, decorate the streets with extraordinary beauty. In this quiet environment, the family members of the employees of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory live not in peace. They are building factories and learning technology with soaring energy, contributing to socialist construction.

　　On August 20th, we visited this rare flower blooming in Zhengzhou City with excitement. As soon as we entered the office of the Family Committee, we were immediately attracted by the slogan "Socialization of Labor, Collectivization of Life, Communism of Thought."

　　Stepping out of the small family circle, running factories, and participating in production are the sincere hopes of the family members of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory employees. This spring, when studying the General Line, the family members generally felt that the heavy housework tied them down, making it impossible for them to contribute more to the country's socialist construction. They said, "If we don't study the General Line, we are just 'five goods'; if we study the General Line and are still just 'five goods', then how can we do more for socialist construction?" They also composed a quick-rhythm rhyme: "Doing housework, truly anxious; full of drive, unable to unleash. Spinning around the stove, truly worried, how to strive to reach the upstream?" Therefore, when they were once liberated from the tedious housework, they were so ecstatic.

　　In early June, as soon as the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory's Family Committee decided to run a factory, the family members came out of their homes one after another, personally preparing for the establishment of factories and diligently learning technology. They quickly established the August 1st Paper Mill, Chemical Plate Factory, Hardware Factory, Wood Factory, Alcohol Factory, Shoe Factory, Sewing Factory, and Laundry. Currently, they are also planning to build a coking plant, cement plant, and bicycle repair shop, etc.

　　It's not easy to have a group of housewives start factories from scratch. Although leaders and employees gave them a lot of help, investment, errands, labor, and learning technology could not entirely rely on others. Which of these small factories did not embody their hard work? The birth of the August 1st Paper Mill was even more the result of an arduous struggle.

　　As soon as the news of running a paper mill spread, everyone started preparing rooms and building small pools; if they didn't know the technology, they would go to learn from masters. Wu Dezhen and Zhou Yuying were already small-footed women in their forties. In order to learn the technology, they traveled a long distance from Zhengzhou to Mi County to study when the weather was very hot. That day, they took a bus and walked mountain roads, so tired that their backs ached, but they encouraged each other, saying, "No matter how long the road, it is shorter than the 25,000-li Long March. We must learn the spirit of the Red Army." When they arrived at their destination, they did not rest, but immediately started learning the technology. They worked all night, and the next morning, before the sun came out, they returned.

　　On July 29th, before the paper mill's stone roller was installed, Zhou Yuying, Jia Xiuying, and six or seven others pulled a cart of paper scraps to a nearby agricultural cooperative to borrow a stone roller. The roller was heavy, the weather was hot, and everyone was sweating and panting. Just as it was about to be rolled, there was suddenly a strong wind and rain. They quickly took off their clothes, wrapped the paper scraps, and ran back in the rain. On the eve of "August 1st", in order to make the first batch of paper as a gift for "August 1st", they spent another sleepless night. One moment they were taking out paper scraps, the next they were mixing pulp, everyone was so busy that they were sweating. On the morning of August 1st, they finally made the first batch of paper. Everyone beat gongs and drums, carrying the paper they made themselves to the Party Committee to report the good news.

　　After visiting these factories, a profound impression we got was that after the family members of employees were liberated from the tedious housework, they immediately exerted tremendous power in production, and infinite wisdom shone with dazzling light. In the chemical factory, we saw a strange product, square plates, with a surface as smooth as a layer of glass.

　　"What is this?"

　　"This is a chemical sawdust board, made by mixing sawdust, magnesium sulfate, floor yellow, magnesium chloride, talc, etc., with a concentration of 1.8..." Zhang Xueying, Qi Xiulan, Liu Meilan, and Wang Yongzhen answered our questions in fluent terms. These four young women are all mothers of three children. In the past, they stayed at home all day cooking and taking care of their children, believing that they could only live off their husbands for the rest of their lives, but today they are directly creating wealth for the country. They mastered the complex technology of making chemical boards in less than a week. Those days, they couldn't eat or sleep, thinking about learning the technology all day long. They adopted various methods to try and produce it, and sure enough, the quality was even better than that made by the master craftsmen. Now the chemical boards they make can replace the steel plates on the sizing machine doors. This one item alone can save 20 tons of steel per year. The scene in the alcohol factory was even more moving. Several small houses were divided into steaming rooms, filtration rooms, and laboratories, etc. Factory director Yang Wenmin was busy back and forth, just like a skilled technician. Seeing her flexible operation, no one would have thought that she was an ordinary housewife not long ago. The factories run by the family members are gradually radiating brilliance in production. In less than a month, they have created more than 1,000 yuan of wealth for the country. The alcohol, chemical boards, paper, shoes, wood products, etc. they created themselves are gradually meeting the needs of the factory and all the employees and their families.

　　The visitor's mood is never still. What excites you here is not the grand scene of modern production, nor the heart-pounding sound of motors, but the spirit of these new production forces, their conscious soaring energy and the creative spirit of the masters, which is more touching than anything else. When you visit, they do not hide their heartfelt joy, and repeatedly tell the story of how they run factories and learn technology, making people share this joy with them from the bottom of their hearts. In the past, when people mentioned housewives, they associated them with backwardness, inferiority, and narrow-mindedness, but today, standing in front of you are producers full of confidence and pride. However, they also understand the difficulties on their path forward. They always say: "Please give us more advice! We are still learning how to do it?" Humble and proud, this is the noble style of communism that has grown rapidly in their thinking after they started working.

　　After the family members participated in labor production, their labor and life were organized and orderly built into a collective. The family members of the employees are now as carefree and enthusiastically working in the factory as men, going to work and getting off work every day according to a set time. When mothers go to work, the children also have their own collective life. The Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory has more than 4,900 family members, and more than 2,000 children under the age of seven. The family members have organized and established more than 100 nurseries and breastfeeding stations.

　　Establishing public canteens is also an important change in their lives. It is these canteens that have enabled more than 1,000 women to break away from housework, move from the stove to the workshop, and become workers from family members.

　　When we visited the West No. 1 Street Public Canteen, we smelled a burst of fragrance from afar, the fragrance of stir-fried vegetables, the fragrance of new rice. More than a dozen women in their forties were working as nervously and happily as the family members working in the factory, getting up at two o'clock in the morning to arrange the day's meals for everyone. The meals here are cheap, the variety is new, clean, hygienic, and the service is thoughtful. This feels more comfortable than some of the canteens I saw on the street, with a home-like taste. There are a total of 40 such canteens.

　　Various new scenes make us deeply feel that the flowers of communism are blooming in people's minds. Participating in social labor and collective life has caused a huge change in people's thinking. Hearing such stories: When they started running factories, canteens, and nurseries, some people were picky about their jobs and unwilling to work as cooks and nursery workers.

　　"I've been spinning around the stove for half my life, and now I'm still asked to spin around the stove, I won't do it!"

　　"How good it is to be a worker! You can learn technology and culture, what's the point of taking care of children and cooking!"

　　"If you want to be a worker, go to a big factory, a small factory is meaningless."

　　After a debate, the white flag in their minds was pulled down. Shen Xuezhi used to want to be a worker, but when she understood that the work of a cook was also part of collective labor, she fell in love with this line of work. Aunt Qi, who is forty years old, already has seven children. She signed up to be a nursery worker. Someone said to her that she couldn't earn much money in this line of work. She replied well: "I am not doing it to make money. I am doing it to liberate myself and liberate the family members of the whole factory so that they can participate in production. Even if there is no money, I will do it!" Here, the atmosphere of mutual assistance, unity, and friendship between neighbors and between couples is growing day by day. Many workers help their wives learn technology and culture. Cao Yuzhen, the director of the wood factory, has a better relationship with her husband after she started working. They divided the housework. When her husband's clothes were torn, Cao Yuzhen couldn't take care of it, so he clumsily sewed it himself. Once, he said to Cao Yuzhen: "You are not simple now, you are better than me. I am only a fifth-grade worker? But you are the director of the wood factory, and you have become a leading cadre, so I have to obey you." As they spoke and laughed, the waves of happiness washed over them.

　　Housewives going out of their homes to participate in social labor is simply like a storm, it is changing the private small families left over from thousands of years, and also changing the relationship between people, and new moral customs are growing rapidly. (Attached picture)

　　郑州访奇花
　　杨昌凤　刘野
    初秋的日子，郑州市南阳路上一片宜人的景色。梧桐和杨槐，芙蓉和美人蕉，把街道装饰得格外美丽。在这幽静的环境中，郑州纺织机械厂的职工家属们生活得并不平静。他们正在以冲天干劲办工厂、学技术，为社会主义建设贡献力量。
    8月20日，我们怀着激动的心情访问了这朵在郑州市盛开的奇花。一走进家属委员会办公室，马上被“劳动社会化，生活集体化，思想共产主义化”的标语吸引住。
    走出家庭小圈子，办工厂，参加生产，这是郑州纺织机械厂职工家属们殷切的希望。今年春天，家属们在学习总路线的时候，普遍感到繁重的家务劳动缠住了她们的身子，没法为国家社会主义建设贡献出更多的力量。她们说：“不学总路线是搞五好，学了总路线还是五好，就不能为社会主义建设多作点工作么？”她们还编了快板：“搞家务，真心焦；有干劲，鼓不了。锅台转，真发愁，怎样力争到上游？”因此，当她们一旦从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来的时候，她们是那样欢欣若狂。
    6月初，郑州纺织机械厂家属委员会一决定办工厂，家属们都纷纷走出家庭，亲自动手筹建工厂、苦学技术。她们很快地办起了八一造纸厂、化学制板厂、五金厂、木工厂、酒精厂、制鞋厂、缝纫厂和洗染厂。目前还正在筹建炼焦厂、水泥厂和自行车修理厂等。
    让一群家庭妇女白手起家来兴办工厂可不容易。虽然领导和职工们给予她们很多帮助，但是，投资、跑腿、出力气、学技术，就不能完全依靠别人。这一个个小工厂，哪一个没有凝结着她们的心血？八一造纸厂的诞生，更是经过一场艰苦的斗争。
    要办造纸厂的消息一传出，大家就张罗着腾房屋、砌小池；不会技术，就去拜师傅。吴德珍和周玉英，已经是四十来岁的小脚妇女。为了学技术，她们在天气正热的时候，从郑州长途跋涉到密县去学习。那天，她们坐汽车，走山路，累得腰酸腿疼，还是彼此鼓励说：“路再长，总比二万五千里长征短得多。我们要学习红军的精神。”到了目的地，她们并没有休息，马上开始学技术。整整干了一个通宵，第二天早上，太阳还没出来，她们就回来了。
    7月29日，造纸厂的纸碾还没安装好，周玉英和贾秀英等六、七个人，就拉着一车纸屑到附近农业社去借用石碾。碾子重、天气热，个个人汗如雨下，直喘气。快要碾好了，突然又来了一阵狂风大雨。她们赶快脱下衣服，把纸屑包起来，冒着雨直往回跑。“八一”的头天晚上，为了造出第一批纸来给“八一”献礼，她们又熬过了一个不眠之夜。一会儿掏纸末，一会儿又和纸浆，人人忙的汗流浃背。8月1日清晨，她们终于造出了第一批纸。大家敲锣打鼓，抬着亲手造出来的纸到党委会去报喜。
    参观了这些工厂，我们得出的一个深刻印象是：职工家属从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来以后，立刻就在生产上发挥出巨大的力量，无穷尽的智慧闪烁着耀眼的光芒。在化工厂里，我们看到一种令人奇异的产品，一块块方形的板子，板面光滑得像是铺了一层玻璃。
    “这是什么？”
    “是化学锯末板，用锯末、夌苦土、地板黄、氯化镁、滑石粉等混合搅拌成的，浓度一点八……”张雪英、齐秀兰、刘美兰和王永珍用流利的术语回答着我们的问题。这四位年轻的妇女都是三个孩子的妈妈，以前她们在家里整天做饭看孩子，认定这一生只能吃一辈子丈夫饭了，可是今天她们却直接为国家创造着财富。她们不到一个星期就掌握了制化学板的复杂技术。那些天，她们吃不下饭，睡不着觉，整天想着学技术的事，她们采用各种办法试制，果然比老师傅做的质量还要好。现在她们制出的化学板，可以代替浆纱机门上的钢板，就这一项，一年能够节省二十吨钢材。酒精厂里的情景更是动人。几间矮小的房子分成了蒸煮室、过滤室、化验室等，厂长杨文敏前前后后忙碌着，简直像一个熟练的技师。看到她灵活的操作，谁也想不到不久以前她还是一个普通的家庭妇女。家属们办的这些工厂，在生产上正在逐渐放射着异彩，不到一个月，她们已经为国家创造了一千多元的财富。她们亲手创造出来的酒精、化学板、纸、鞋、木器等等，正逐步满足着工厂和全厂职工、家属们的需要。
    参观者的心情是一刻也不能平静的。这里激动你的不是现代化生产的雄伟场面，也不是震人心弦的马达声，然而，这些新的生产大军的精神，她们那种自觉地冲天干劲和主人翁的创造精神，却比任何东西都富于感人的力量。你去参观，她们毫不掩饰自己发自内心的喜悦，一遍又一遍讲述她们办工厂、学技术的经过，使人们从心里和她们共同享受这种愉快。过去，人们一提到家庭妇女，就和落后、自卑、心胸窄狭等字眼连在一起，然而今天站在你面前的却是充满了信心和自豪感的生产者。但是，她们也懂得自己前进路上的困难，她们总是说：“多给我们提提意见吧！我们还在学习着干呢？”谦虚而自豪，这是她们参加工作以后，在思想上迅速成长起来的共产主义的高尚风格。
    家属们参加劳动生产以后，她们的劳动和生活，有组织、有秩序地建成了一个集体。职工家属们现在已经和男人一样无牵无挂、兴致勃勃地在工厂里工作，每天按照一定的时间上班下班。妈妈们去上班，孩子们也有着自己的集体生活。郑州纺织机械厂有家属四千九百多人，七岁以下的孩子就有两千多，家属们组织起来建立了一百多个托儿所和哺乳站。
    成立公共食堂也是她们生活中的一个重要变化。就是靠这些食堂，使一千多名妇女摆脱了家务劳动，从锅台走上了车间，从家属变成了工人。
    我们去参观西一街公共食堂的时候，很远就闻到了一阵阵扑鼻的香味，是炒菜的油香，是新稻的饭香。十几位四十岁上下的妇女和在工厂里工作的家属一样，紧张愉快地劳动着，她们从清晨二时就起床为大家安排着一天的饭菜。这里的饭菜便宜，花样翻新，清洁卫生，服务周到，这比我在街上看到的有些食堂更使人感到舒贴，有家常味。这样的食堂，一共有四十个。
    各种新的景象使我们深刻地感到人们思想上正开放着共产主义的花朵。参加社会劳动和集体生活，这在人们思想上引起了一个巨大的变化。听到这样一些故事：开始办工厂、办食堂、托儿所的时候，有些人对工作挑挑拣拣，不愿意做炊事员和保育员。
    “我围着锅台转了半辈子，现在还叫转锅台，我不干！”
    “当工人有多好！可以学技术、学文化，看孩子做饭有什么出息！”
    “要当工人还是去大工厂，小工厂没有意思。”
    经过一场辩论之后，思想上的白旗被拔掉了。沈学芝以前一心当工人，可是当她懂得了炊事员的工作同样是集体劳动的一部分的时候，她就爱上了这一行。四十岁的齐嫂已经有七个孩子了，她报名当保育员，有人对她说干这一行挣不了多少钱，她回答得好：“我并不是为了挣钱，我是为了解放自己，解放全厂的家属，使她们能够参加生产，就是一个钱没有，我也要干！”在这里，邻里之间、夫妻之间、互助团结友爱的气氛，一天一天增长起来。许多工人帮助自己的妻子学技术，学文化。木工厂厂长曹玉珍参加工作以后，他们夫妻的感情更好了，他们在家务劳动上分了工，她爱人的衣服破了，曹玉珍顾不过来，他就笨手笨脚地自己缝。有一次，他对曹玉珍说：“你现在可不简单了，比咱都强，我才是个五级工人呢？可你却是木工厂厂长，成了领导干部，我得服从你了。”他们说着，笑着，幸福的浪花冲激着他们。
    家庭妇女走出家门参加社会劳动，这简直像一场大风暴，它改变着几千年遗留下来的私有小家庭，也改变着人们之间的关系，新的道德风尚正在迅速成长起来。（附图片）
