Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 26th: Workers in more than a dozen large machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang City, responsible for manufacturing metallurgical and power generation equipment, have recently launched a competition campaign of "Planting Red Banners of the Great Leap Forward, Launching High-Yield Satellites". Workers have put forward thousands of measures to ensure that they will complete 70% of the year's production leap forward plan by the end of September, and provide complete sets of equipment for rolling steel, mining, steelmaking, ironmaking, generators, and motors to all parts of the country in advance.

　　The cadres of some workshops in Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, which is responsible for manufacturing giant metallurgical equipment, have moved to the workshops to live and lead production day and night. The metallurgical equipment of this plant supporting key projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel will be accelerated to completion. Among them, the top equipment of the 1513 type modern blast furnace manufactured for Wuhan Iron and Steel will be delivered two months ahead of schedule in the third quarter.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: Workers in nearly a thousand factories in Shanghai are braving the summer heat to rush to manufacture complete sets of smelting equipment for the development of the iron and steel industry. In the one month or so since production began, the city has completed ten sets of converter equipment with an annual output of 500,000 to 600,000 tons of steel, and two sets of blast furnace equipment with an annual output of more than 200,000 tons of pig iron are also nearing completion.

　　The metallurgical equipment manufacturing tasks undertaken by various factories in Shanghai include complete sets of smelting equipment with an annual output of 3 million tons of pig iron, 3.6 million tons of steel, and 2.8 million tons of steel, as well as some mining, ore dressing, and coking equipment, all of which must be completed in the second half of the year. In order to ensure the timely completion of this task without squeezing out the already heavy production tasks, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China urgently mobilized the mechanical manufacturing forces and mechanical repair forces of all departments in the city to invest in the manufacture of smelting equipment. Hudong Shipyard and Jiangnan Shipyard have undertaken the task of rushing to manufacture equipment. The workers put forward "Everything for steel, only with steel can there be ships!" and "An inch of time for a ton of iron, a drop of sweat for a ton of steel" has become the battle slogan for workers in many factories racing against time.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 26th: In order to support the rapid advancement of the iron and steel "marshal", Tianjin's electromechanical industry is vigorously engaged in the production of blowers. From June to August 15, 533 blowers of 25 cubic meters and 28 cubic meters have been produced, and 322 units have been transported to various parts of Hebei and Shanxi. The workers of each factory are determined to produce more than 1,000 blowers in August, and to trial-produce large blowers of 112 cubic meters and 700 cubic meters.

　　With the rapid development of the iron and steel industry, Tianjin has developed from the original 18 factories producing blowers to 32 factories. Some of the production tasks in these factories that can be slowed down have also been temporarily stopped, concentrating on the production of blowers, and it has been decided to produce more than 1,000 blowers in August.

　　In addition to ensuring the completion of this year's production task of hoists, which is more than four and a half times that of last year, the production of blowers by the joint state-private winch factory increased from 62 units in June to 89 units in July. Recently, they proposed to guarantee the production of 200 units in August and strive to produce 250 units.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 26th: More than 1,000 workers of all ethnic groups in the Hohhot Machinery Factory were mobilized to take emergency measures and decided to rush to produce the first batch of steelmaking equipment with an annual production capacity of 260,000 tons to ensure that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region completes the state plan for steel production this year.

　　Most of these steelmaking equipment are manufactured by the Hohhot Machinery Factory. This factory, which has only 50 small and medium-sized machine tools and has just switched from manufacturing agricultural and animal husbandry machinery to manufacturing metallurgical equipment, has undertaken the task of manufacturing steelmaking equipment with an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons and four or five sets of small and medium-sized rolling mills in the second half of the year. Among them, ten converters from 1.5 tons to 6 tons and complete sets of equipment must be manufactured before the end of October.

　　Recently, all the workers in the factory discussed and decided: the whole factory should be mobilized to deliver the first batch of ten converters with an annual production capacity of 260,000 tons before September 15, to ensure that the steel plants that ordered the equipment can produce steel on "October 1st".

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 26th: Tens of thousands of workers in more than 160 machinery factories in various parts of Anhui Province have been urgently mobilized under the leadership of party committees at all levels and have fully devoted themselves to the battle to rush to manufacture smelting equipment.

　　In late July and early August, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened two provincial machinery industry conferences and an emergency telephone conference, calling for making the manufacture of metallurgical equipment the central task that overrides everything else. The Provincial Party Committee called on all machinery factories to vigorously promote the method of using small machine tools to do big jobs and special tools to fully improve equipment utilization. In addition, it is also preparing to mobilize the casting forces of organs, troops, and handicraft cooperatives to join the battle.

　　At present, the workers in the province's machinery industry departments are investing in the struggle to rush to manufacture metallurgical equipment with high revolutionary enthusiasm and firm confidence. The workers in more than 120 factories in various prefectures and counties that are responsible for manufacturing 300 sets of blast furnace equipment below 4.5 cubic meters are also adopting the method of dividing and collaborating on a prefectural basis to rush to manufacture metallurgical equipment. Wuhu Prefecture divides three collaboration zones centered on Tunxi, Dangtu, and Xuancheng, and divides the work to rush to manufacture metallurgical equipment day and night. (Attached picture)

    据新华社沈阳26日电　沈阳市担负制造冶金、发电设备的十多个大型机械制造厂的职工，最近两天来开展了一个“插遍跃进红旗、大放高产卫星”的竞赛运动，职工们提出了千百条措施，保证在9月底以前完成全年生产跃进计划的70％，提前向全国各地提供大量轧钢、采矿、炼钢、炼铁、发电机、电动机等成套设备。
    担负制造巨型冶金设备任务的沈阳重型机器厂，一些车间干部都已搬到车间住宿，日夜领导生产。这个厂支援鞍钢、武钢等重点工程的冶金设备，都将加速完成，其中为武钢制造的一五一三型现代化高炉炉顶设备，决定提前两个月在第三季度交货。
    据新华社上海26日电　上海市近千家工厂的工人，正冒着盛暑为发展钢铁工业赶制成套冶炼设备，从投入生产到现在的一个多月来，全市已完成了十套年产五、六十万吨钢的转炉设备，两套年产二十多万吨生铁的高炉设备也已接近完工。
    上海市各厂承担的冶金设备制造任务，包括年产三百万吨生铁、三百六十万吨钢、二百八十万吨钢材的成套冶炼设备，以及一部分开矿、选矿、炼焦的设备，全部要在下半年内完成。为了保证在不挤掉原来已很繁重的生产任务的原则下按时完成这一任务，中共上海市委曾紧急动员了全市各个部门的机械制造力量和机械修配力量投入冶炼设备的制造。沪东造船厂、江南造船厂都担负了赶制设备的任务。工人们提出“一切为了钢，有钢才有船！”“一寸光阴一吨铁，一滴汗珠一吨钢”已经成了许多工厂工人与时间赛跑的战斗口号。
    据新华社天津26日电　为了支援钢铁“元帅”迅速升帐，天津市机电工业大搞鼓风机生产。从6月份到8月15日已生产了二十五立方公尺和二十八立方公尺的鼓风机五百三十三台，并有三百二十二台已经运往河北和山西各地。各厂职工决心在8月份生产鼓风机一千台以上，并且要试制一百一十二立方公尺和七百立方公尺的大型鼓风机。
    随着钢铁工业的飞跃发展，天津市从原有十八个生产鼓风机的工厂发展到三十二个厂，在这些工厂中的部分可缓的生产任务也暂时停止下来，集中力量突击鼓风机，决定要在8月内生产出鼓风机一千台以上。
    公私合营卷扬机厂除保证完成今年超过去年四倍半的卷扬机生产任务外，鼓风机的生产，6月份是六十二台，7月份就提高到八十九台，最近，他们又提出在8月份保证生产二百台，争取生产二百五十台。
    据新华社呼和浩特26日电呼和浩特机械厂一千多名各族职工总动员，采取紧急措施，决定突击赶制出第一批年产能力二十六万吨的炼钢设备，保证内蒙古自治区今年钢的生产完成国家计划。
    这些炼钢设备，绝大部分由呼和浩特机械厂制造。这个仅有五十台中小型机床、刚刚由制造农牧业机械转为制造冶金设备的工厂，下半年承担了年产能力五十万吨的炼钢设备和四、五套中小型轧钢机的制造任务，其中十座一吨半到六吨的转炉及全套设备，要在10月底以前制成。
    最近，全厂职工又讨论决定：全厂总动员，在9月15日以前交出第一批年产能力二十六万吨的十座转炉，保证订货的各钢铁厂“十一”出钢。
    据新华社合肥26日电　安徽省各地一百六十多个机械工厂的数万名职工，在各级党委的领导下，已经紧急动员起来，全力投入了赶制冶炼设备的战斗。
    中共安徽省委在7月下旬和8月上旬，曾经两次召开全省机械工业会议和一次紧急电话会议，号召把制造冶金设备作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。省委号召各机械厂大力提倡小车床干大活和工具专用的办法，充分提高设备利用率。另外，还准备调动机关、部队、手工业社的铸造力量投入战斗。
    现在，全省机械工业部门职工正以高昂的革命干劲和坚强信心，投入赶制冶金设备的斗争。担负三百套四点五立方公尺以下高炉设备制造任务的各专、县的一百二十多个工厂的职工，目前也正在采取以专区为单位划片协作的办法来赶制冶金设备。芜湖专区以屯溪、当涂、宣城为中心，划分三个协作区，分工日夜赶制冶金设备。（附图片）
