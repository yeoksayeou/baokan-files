Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The Fourth Japan大会 Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament World Congress solemnly opened at 10:00 am today at the Waseda University Memorial Hall in Tokyo. More than 5,000 representatives from all over Japan and 75 representatives from six international organizations and 27 countries participated in the大会.

Fujima Mikae, Permanent Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, emphasized three tasks of this大会 in his opening speech: to ban nuclear weapons testing; to prevent the nuclear arming of Japan; and to uphold democracy.

The大会 elected a presidium of 45 people, including Kazami Akira, Shiio Benkyo, and Yamataka Shigeru.

Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, made a general report. He stated that it was extremely gratifying that representatives from all over Japan and the world had gathered together for the大会. Behind these representatives is the great power of hundreds of millions of people around the world, strongly supporting the大会.

The report pointed out that the Soviet Union had already announced a unilateral suspension of nuclear testing on March 31st. This is a manifestation of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and has a huge impact on the movement for the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. Currently, the United States and Britain, defying the wishes of the people of the world, are brazenly conducting nuclear tests; France is also planning to conduct tests in the Sahara Desert, creating new disasters for the people of Africa. The people of the world must not forgive these actions and will fight with all their might for the conclusion of an international agreement to ban nuclear weapons.

The report emphasized that some countries in the world are now engaged in preparations for atomic warfare in the form of nuclear armament. In East Asia, Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek group, and the Syngman Rhee group are brewing to form a Northeast Asia military group, and nuclear weapons are being shipped into these areas. This is a hostile act against China and will also aggravate the tense situation in East Asia. The US and British armed intervention in Arab countries has created a serious situation in the Middle East, which also carries the risk of developing into atomic warfare.

The report pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet outwardly expresses opposition to atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and nuclear armaments, but secretly engages in nuclear armament. The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet pursues a policy of hostility towards China, leading to the severance of Japan-China relations. These policies of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet are essentially the same as its policies of intensifying the suppression of domestic democracy. In the future, it is necessary to combine the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and oppose nuclear armament with the movement to uphold democracy.

The report pointed out that the peace movement has made great progress in the past year and has begun to influence real politics, but the reactionary forces have also strengthened their offensive and are gradually preparing for atomic warfare. The report said that the Fourth大会 is being held at this time is of great significance. The basic task of the大会 is to decide on concrete policies in order to push real politics in the direction of peace, and at the same time to work with all mankind to implement the policies decided by the大会 through joint action. Therefore, all discussions at the大会 must be concrete, scientific, and action-oriented.

The report expressed great regret that the Chinese delegates, who have made great contributions to the movement to ban nuclear weapons and rescue atomic bomb victims, were unable to attend this大会 due to the unfriendly attitude of the Japanese government. The report pointed out that it is necessary to restore friendly relations between Japan and China and to achieve the normalization of Japan-China diplomatic relations. This issue is intrinsically linked to the大会 against atomic and hydrogen bombs, so this大会 must discuss this issue in conjunction with other issues.

The大会 read out the congratulatory telegram from the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. The大会 received 1,789 congratulatory telegrams and letters from foreign organizations and prominent individuals. The大会 also received 50 congratulatory telegrams and letters from domestic organizations and prominent individuals in Japan, including the Speaker of the Ryukyu Legislative Assembly and the Chairman of the Japan-Soviet Association, Ichiro Hatoyama.

Indian delegate Reddy and West German delegate Heinrich Vogel delivered speeches on behalf of the foreign delegates at the meeting.

The大会 passed an emergency resolution proposed by Yamamoto Kumaichi requesting the Japanese government to approve the entry of the Korean delegates.

The agenda committee submitted a proposal to the大会 requesting the大会 to discuss the issue of the US and British troops invading West Asia and the issue of normalizing Japan-China relations, which was immediately accepted by the大会.

At this time, the Hiroshima-Tokyo 1,000-kilometer peace march, the Aomori-Tokyo and Nagasaki-Tokyo bicycle relay race teams, and the Hiroshima-Tokyo motorcycle team arrived at the venue together. All participants immediately stood up and warmly applauded to welcome them. The team went on stage amidst thunderous cheers from the audience. Abbot Nishimoto, on behalf of all the team members, said that we have overcome difficulties and finally completed the entire journey with the wishes of all the Japanese people. However, this is not the end but the starting point. Nishimoto called on everyone to continue to strive towards the final goal of achieving a ban on nuclear testing, preventing nuclear armament, and upholding democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The Fourth Japan大会 Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament World Congress continued its meeting this afternoon. Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo and Communist Party Secretary-General Miyamoto Kenji addressed the大会.

Four delegates from the Mongolian People's Republic entered the venue, and the audience applauded warmly to welcome them.

The大会 then passed a proposal from the agenda committee to send a telegram to encourage the peace march currently being held in Okinawa.

Hiroshima atomic bomb victim representative Takeshi Takeuchi, Nagasaki representatives Sumako Fukuda and Chieko Watanabe all spoke at the meeting.

Chieko Watanabe said that we have had enough of the disasters of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Watanabe expressed opposition to Japan's implementation of nuclear armament.

Watanabe said that she was very happy to have met many representatives promoting the peace movement at this大会. However, she felt very sorry not to have met the Chinese delegates. Watanabe appealed to all participants to work hard to create a Japan where Chinese delegates could come.

At the afternoon大会, Akira Kazami, Director of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, reported on the issue of immediately and comprehensively ceasing nuclear weapons testing, banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, and disarmament; Yoshitaro Hirano, Director of the Japan Peace Committee, reported on the issue of preventing the nuclear arming of Japan; Ayako Ishii, Secretary-General of the Women's Democratic Club, reported on the issue of atomic war preparations and people's lives; Shoichi Sakata, Professor at Nagoya University, reported on the issue of radiation hazards and countermeasures; Ichiro Moritaki, Professor at Hiroshima University, reported on the actual situation of suffering atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters and rescuing victims; and Yasuo Onaka, Vice-Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, reported on the issue of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and the peace movement.

The大会 decided to discuss the above six reports in eighteen venues tomorrow.

    反对试验核武器　阻止核武装日本　拥护民主
　　禁止原子弹氢弹日本大会开幕
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会日本大会今天上午十时在东京早稻田大学纪念堂隆重开幕。来自日本全国各地的五千多名代表和六个国际组织及二十七个国家的七十五名代表参加了大会。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会常任理事藤间身加荣在开幕词中强调了这次大会的三项任务：禁止试验核武器；阻止核武装日本；拥护民主。
    大会选出风见章、椎尾辨匡、山高繁等四十五人组成日本大会议长团。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁作了一般报告。他表示，日本全国各地和世界各洲的代表集合在一起举行大会，是极可庆幸的。这些代表的背后有全世界成亿人民的巨大力量在坚强地支持着大会。
    报告指出，苏联已经在3月31日宣布单独停止核试验。这正是苏联和平政策的表现，同时，这对于完全禁止核武器运动有巨大作用。目前，美英两国违背世界人民的愿望，悍然进行核试验；法国也要在撒哈拉沙漠举行试验，给非洲人民制造新的灾害。全世界人民对于这些行为决不能宽恕，同时将以全力为缔结禁止核武器的国际协定而奋斗。
    报告强调指出，世界上有若干国家现在正在以进行核武装的形式从事原子战争准备。在东亚，日本、蒋介石集团、李承晚集团之间正在酝酿组织东北亚军事集团，核武器正在运进这些地方。这是对中国的敌对行为；同时也将加重东亚的紧张局势。美英武装干涉阿拉伯国家，在中东造成严重局势，这也有向原子战争发展的危险。
    报告指出，岸信介内阁表面上表示反对原子弹、氢弹和核武装，但暗中进行核武装。岸信介内阁推行敌视中国的政策，以致日中关系断绝。岸信介内阁的这些政策和加紧镇压国内民主的政策在本质上是一样的。今后必须把禁止原子弹氢弹和反对核武装的运动以及拥护民主的运动结合在一起。
    报告指出，和平运动在过去一年内有很大发展，已经开始影响现实政治，可是反动势力也加强了进攻，并且在逐步进行原子战争的准备。报告说，第四届大会正当这个时候举行，意义非常重大。大会的基本任务在于决定具体方针，以便把现实政治推向和平的方向，同时要同全世界人类以共同行动来实践大会所决定的方针。因此，大会的一切讨论必须是具体的、科学的、有行动性的。
    报告表示，对于对禁止核武器运动和救护原子弹被害者有过很大贡献的中国代表由于日本政府的不友好态度而不能参加本届大会，是非常遗憾的。报告指出，必须恢复日中友好关系，必须实现日中邦交的正常化，这个问题同禁止原子弹氢弹大会有本质的联系，因此本届大会一定要把这个问题和其他问题结合起来讨论。
    大会宣读了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的贺电。大会收到一千七百八十九件来自外国团体和著名人士给大会的贺电和贺信。大会还收到了琉球立法院议长、日苏协会会长鸠山一郎等日本国内团体和著名人士的五十件贺电和贺信。
    印度代表雷迪和西德代表海因里希·沃格尔代表外国代表在会上致词。
    大会通过了由山本熊一提出的要求日本政府批准朝鲜代表入境的紧急决议。
    大会的议程委员会向大会提出要求大会讨论美英出兵侵略西亚问题和日中关系正常化问题的提案，当即被大会接受。
    这时，广岛—东京一千公里和平大游行队伍、青森—东京和长崎—东京自行车接力长跑队、广岛—东京机器脚踏车队一齐到达会场，全体与会者立即站起来热烈鼓掌欢迎。队伍在全场雷动的欢呼声中走上了讲台。西本笃和尚代表全体队员致词说，我们克服了困难，带着全体日本人民的愿望，终于走完了全部路程。但是，这不是终点而是起点。西本号召大家为达成禁止核试验、阻止核武装和拥护民主的最后目标而继续奋斗。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会日本大会今天下午继续举行会议。社会党委员长铃木茂三郎和共产党书记长宫本显治在大会上致词。
    蒙古人民共和国的四名代表走进了会场，全场热烈鼓掌，表示欢迎。
    大会接着通过了议程委员会的一项提案，决定打电报鼓励正在冲绳举行的和平大游行。
    广岛原子弹受害者代表竹内武士，长崎代表福田须磨子和渡边千惠子都在会上讲了话。
    渡边千惠子说，我们已经受够了原子弹和氢弹的灾害。渡边表示反对日本实行核武装。
    渡边说，她在本届大会里会见了推进和平运动的许多代表感到非常高兴。可是不曾会见中国代表，她觉得非常遗憾。渡边吁请全体与会者努力造成一个中国代表能够前来的日本。
    在下午的大会上，恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章报告了关于立即全面停止试验核武器、禁止原子弹氢弹和裁军的问题；日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎报告了关于阻止核武装日本的问题；妇女民主俱乐部秘书长石井绫子报告了关于原子战争的准备与人民生活的问题；名古屋大学教授坂田昌一报告了关于放射能灾害及其对策问题，广岛大学教授森泷市郎报告了关于遭受原子弹氢弹灾害的实际状况和救护受害者的问题；日本工会总评议会副议长大中康雄报告了关于禁止原子弹氢弹运动和和平运动的问题。
    大会决定明天就上述六个报告分十八个会场进行讨论。（附图片）
