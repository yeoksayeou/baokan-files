Today, this newspaper publishes news that the average yield of early rice in Anhui Province has reached 1,000 jin per mu, and the highest yield of mid-season rice has exceeded the 40,000 jin mark. Anhui has become the first province in our country with an average early rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and the comrades of the Dongfanghong (East is Red) Commune have created the highest record for rice production per mu. This is a great happy event for the people of our country.

Under the shining light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the peasants of our country, with soaring enthusiasm, have achieved one great victory after another, creating unprecedented miracles. Following the unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops, news of early rice harvests has been pouring in. According to recent reports, Hunan Province's more than 20 million mu of early rice yielded 653 jin per mu, with a total output 2.2 times higher than last year; Jiangxi Province's 24.94 million mu of early rice yielded 580 jin per mu, with a total output more than 1.45 times higher than last year. Guangxi Province's more than 12 million mu of early rice yielded 461 jin per mu, with a total output 91% higher than last year. Now, Anhui, a province with an early rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu, has emerged. These facts eloquently prove that the liberated Chinese people are not only capable of cultivating unprecedented high-yield "satellites" of various crops, but more importantly, can achieve unprecedented high-speed increases in production over large areas.

The fact that Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces have achieved large-scale bumper harvests once again proves the correctness of the Party's General Line, and once again proves that "Marxism can produce steel and grain" is an irrefutable truth. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always taught us that politics is the commander, is the soul, and that we must "combine the abstract with the concrete, emphasize both the abstract and the concrete." The comrades in Anhui Province have conscientiously implemented this principle, which is why they have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice. They adopted the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and conducting extensive airing of views and debates, thoroughly refuting various right-leaning conservative ideas, so that various advanced measures for striving for a bumper harvest could be implemented and a large-scale bumper harvest of early rice could be achieved.

The large-scale bumper harvest of early rice in Anhui and other provinces also vividly proves the correctness of the argument that "success depends on human effort, and the subjective initiative of the masses is a great driving force." In the process of early rice production, these regions encountered various natural disasters, and Anhui Province even encountered a drought unseen in decades. However, thanks to the full play given to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses by the local Party committees, they finally overcame one natural disaster after another and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice.

The large-scale bumper harvest of early rice in Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces has become a great driving force, promoting and encouraging the vast number of peasants across the country to strive for even greater harvests of late rice and other major autumn crops. In our country, any initiative that is beneficial to the people's cause, under the leadership of the Party, will quickly become the common wealth of the people of the whole country. With the first province achieving 1,000 jin per mu for early rice, more provinces achieving 1,000 jin per mu will certainly emerge.

### 向安徽人民致敬

　　向安徽人民致敬
    今天本报发表了安徽早稻全省平均亩产千斤和中稻最高亩产量突破四万大关的新闻。安徽已成为我国第一个早稻千斤省，东方红三社的同志们创造了水稻亩产的最高纪录。这是我国人民的大喜事。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线照耀下，我国农民鼓足了冲天干劲，取得了一个又一个伟大胜利，创造了史无前例的奇迹。继夏季作物获得空前大丰收之后，早稻丰收的消息又一个接一个传来。据最近报道，湖南省二千余万亩早稻亩产六百五十三斤，总产量比去年增加二点二倍；江西省二千四百九十四万亩早稻，亩产五百八十斤，总产量比去年增产一点四五倍以上。广西省一千二百多万亩早稻亩产四百六十一斤，总产量比去年增产91％。现在又出现了早稻千斤省——安徽。这些事实雄辩地证明，解放了的中国人民，不仅能够培育出各种作物的史无前例的高产量“卫星”，而且更重要是使大面积获得史无前例的高速度的增产。
    安徽、湖南、江西等省大面积丰收的事实再次证明了党的总路线的正确，再次证明了“马克思主义能够出钢铁、出粮食”是一条颠扑不破的真理。党中央和毛主席经常教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，要“以虚带实、虚实并举”。安徽省的同志们就是认真贯彻了这一方针，才获得了早稻空前大丰收的。他们采用摆事实、讲道理，大鸣大放、大争大辩的方法，彻底驳倒了各种各样的右倾保守思想，各种争取大丰收的先进措施才得以实现，才取得了早稻的大面积丰收。
    安徽等省早稻大面积丰收也生动地证明了“事在人为，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力”这一论断的正确性。这些地区在早稻生产的过程中，曾经遇到了各种各样的自然灾害，安徽省甚至遇到了几十年来未有的干旱，但由于各地党委充分地发挥了广大群众的积极性和创造性，终于把一个个自然灾害战胜，夺得了早稻空前大丰收。
    安徽、湖南、江西等省的早稻大面积丰收，已经变成了一个伟大的动力，正推动和鼓舞着全国广大农民争取晚稻和其他大秋作物更大的丰收。在我们的国家里，任何一个有利人民事业的创举，在党的领导下，很快就会变成全国人民的共同财富。有了第一个早稻千斤省，也一定会出现更多的千斤省。
