Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13th. Shanghai's light industry and textile industry departments, considering the needs of various rural areas after this year's bumper harvest, are taking various measures to increase the production of light and textile industrial products by another 1.1 billion yuan in the second half of the year, based on the original Great Leap Forward plan. After this additional boost, Shanghai's textile industry will increase production by about 40% in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and light industry will increase production by nearly double.

According to reports from commercial departments across the country, the demand for daily necessities from farmers nationwide has greatly increased this year. After the merger and expansion of many cooperatives, bicycles are generally selling well. In order to reduce household labor and have more time to participate in field production, rural women are setting up sewing groups, and in some areas, sewing machines are beginning to be in short supply. With the arrival of the rural cultural upsurge, the demand for cultural and educational supplies has surged. Toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouth cups, and other items have become bestsellers. In response to this situation, Shanghai will increase the production of socks, towels, sanitary clothing, thermos bottles, batteries, aluminum pots, and other products by 30% to 60% in the second half of the year compared to the first half. The production of bicycles, sewing machines, flashlights, gas lamps, fountain pens, pencils, toothpaste, and other items will be increased by as much as two or three times in some cases.

Currently, light industry and textile workers throughout the city are doing everything possible to take various measures to increase production. The speed of all textile factory machines in the city has been increased. Individual machines in State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 are running as high as 430 revolutions. Workshops are operating non-stop, 24 hours a day. Factories are also actively adjusting labor organization so that, once cotton arrives in the fourth quarter, they can immediately increase the number of shifts without adding workers. More than ten specialized light industrial companies whose products are directly related to rural needs have seen that some factories have decided to adopt the method of strengthening inter-factory mutual support and adjustment, first solving the urgent needs and then expanding the source of supply, to solve temporary difficulties after the index leap forward. All industries are currently mobilizing the masses to further launch offensives against the weak links hindering the current leap forward, changing many manual operations to machine production. After production is improved, the surplus manpower will go to support factories that need reinforcements, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient manpower through self-reliance.

### 上海轻工业增产迎丰收

　　上海轻工业增产迎丰收
    据新华社上海13日电　上海轻工业和纺织工业部门考虑到今年各地农村大丰收后的需要，正在采取各种措施，准备下半年在原来的跃进计划基础上再增产价值十一亿元的轻纺工业品。这次加码后，上海纺织工业下半年将比上半年增产40％左右，轻工业增产将近一倍。
    据各地商业部门反映，今年全国农民对日用品的需要量大大增加。许多合作社合并扩大后，自行车普遍畅销；农村妇女为了减轻家务劳动，有更多的时间参加田间生产，纷纷成立缝纫组，有些地区缝纫机开始有供不应求的情况。农村文化高潮一来，文教用品的需要量骤增。牙膏、牙刷、口杯等成了旺销产品。针对这种情况，上海下半年袜子、毛巾、卫生衣、热水瓶、电池、铝锅等产品要比上半年增加三成到六成；自行车、缝纫机、电筒、汽灯、钢笔、铅笔、牙膏等用品，有的增加一倍，有的多到二、三倍。
    目前，全市轻纺职工正在千方百计采取各种增产措施。全市纺织厂车速已经全部加快。国棉二厂个别机台高达四百三十转。车间里做到人停机不停，开足二十四小时。各厂还在积极调整劳动组织，待四季度棉花一到，在不增加工人的情况下，立即开足班次。产品和农村需要直接有关的十多个轻工业专业公司看到部分工厂在指标跃进后，决定采取加强厂际互相支援调剂、先救急后再扩大来源的办法来解决暂时的困难。各行业目前已在发动群众进一步针对阻碍当前跃进的薄弱环节，展开攻势，把许多手工操作改用机器生产，生产提高后，多余的人力就去支援需要增援的工厂，自力更生克服人力不足的困难。
