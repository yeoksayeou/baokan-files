Comprehensive Utilization Enhances Economic Value
Shanxi and Sichuan Have Comprehensively Arranged Outlets for Potatoes

    (Our Newspaper) Taiyuan dispatch – Shanxi Province has made comprehensive plans and arrangements for the comprehensive utilization, processing, storage of the soon to be abundant yams (potatoes, same below), and has begun various specific preparatory work.
    The planting area of yams (including sweet potatoes) in Shanxi Province has more than doubled compared to last year. Now, the yams are growing well, and a bumper harvest is very promising. It is estimated that the total output of the province can reach 20 billion to 25 billion catties. The average agricultural population is 1,400 catties per person, and the average in concentrated production areas is more than 3,000 catties per person, which is obviously impossible to consume. According to calculations by relevant provincial departments, in addition to a certain proportion of food left for human consumption, seeds required by agricultural cooperatives, and a portion needed for unified purchase for supply to urban residents, the province still has more than 15 billion catties of yams that need to be processed and manufactured to be handled.
    Because yam skin is thin, has high moisture content, is prone to rot, and is not easy to store and transport, processing and manufacturing has become a complex and arduous task after the bumper harvest. In view of this situation, relevant provincial departments have conducted several investigations and studies since July, summarizing and promoting advanced experience. It was recently decided that: First, agricultural cooperatives planting yams should be mobilized and assisted to run about 20,000 crude starch processing factories, distilleries, vinegar breweries, and soy sauce workshops. The crude starch residue should be used to brew liquor, vinegar, and soy sauce using local methods, and then the distiller's grains and vinegar grains should be used as livestock feed, to achieve comprehensive and continuous utilization. Second, crude starch will be processed into refined starch, and liquor will be refined into alcohol, for large-scale export, to supply auxiliary materials for textile, papermaking, printing and dyeing, printing, and medical departments, and to supply food and beverage industries with starch noodles, pastries, etc. To this end, the province plans to build 60 new large and medium-sized refined starch factories, which can produce more than 300 million catties of refined starch annually. Twenty new alcohol processing plants will be built. The annual output of alcohol will be 55 million catties. Eighty new alcohol distillation stations will be built, producing 80 million catties of alcohol annually. Third, produce valuable chemical raw materials and products. Plans are in place to produce butanol and acetone, and to manufacture alcohol solvents, butadiene-styrene rubber, and celluloid mixtures. To this end, plans are in place to build and expand chemical plants in Datong and Taiyuan, using yams as the main raw material.
    By adopting the above three methods, 15 billion catties of yams can be completely processed and utilized comprehensively. This will not only reduce spoilage losses but also greatly enhance the role of yams, adding a huge wealth to the country. According to preliminary calculations, every 10,000 catties of yams can produce 1,600 catties of refined flour, and the flour residue can be used to extract 325 catties of alcohol, with a total value of 645 yuan, which is more than double the original price of yams. If used as chemical industrial raw materials, the value generated is twice as high as starch and alcohol, and six times as high as the original price of yams. Therefore, leading departments at all levels attach great importance to the comprehensive utilization of yams. The Provincial Department of Grain, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Light Industry recently focused on studying and solving the funding and equipment problems for the construction and expansion of processing plants, stipulating that factories in each system should divide their responsibilities and provide strong assistance. It is stipulated that the Taiyuan Fruit Processing Factory, the Changzhi Flour Mill, and the egg-beating factories in various counties should be appropriately rebuilt or expanded into yam starch factories according to their production situation. Factories belonging to other systems with power generation, boilers, and drying equipment should also undertake some refined starch tasks under unified planning. The transportation, storage, and technical issues in comprehensive utilization after the yam harvest were studied and arranged at the Wuzhai Conference held in early June. Now, relevant departments in various special counties have begun to reform transportation tools, create storage cellars, and train processing technicians, striving to make full preparations before the harvest.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 18th – Sweet potatoes in Sichuan Province are growing more abundantly and better this year, and the total output is estimated to reach 100 billion catties, about three times more than last year. The specific arrangements for the 100 billion catties of sweet potatoes produced in the province this year are: more than 70% of the sweet potatoes are in the hands of agricultural cooperatives and farmers, including seeds, feed, food, and portions freely disposed of by farmers; the remaining 20% or more will be purchased by the state to offset unified purchase grain, of which a small portion of fresh sweet potatoes will be distributed to urban residents and government employees along with food rations, and most of them will be processed by local factories and agricultural cooperatives into liquor, alcohol, starch, vermicelli, and dried sweet potatoes, which will be purchased by grain and commercial departments.
    In order to do a good job in the organization and leadership and technical training of sweet potato processing and comprehensive utilization, the grain department will establish 1,000 sweet potato starch processing plants and 1,000 alcohol manufacturing plants in the sweet potato production areas of the province. The machinery and tools required by the factories will be manufactured and installed by industrial and handicraft departments using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and processing demonstrations will be conducted for local farmers. The industrial and handicraft departments have also created a batch of improved tools specifically for rural sweet potato processing and comprehensive utilization, such as hand-cranked and foot-operated slicers, shredders, crushers, dryers, winemaking utensils, liquor containers, and simple and easy-to-make small tools, to supply agricultural cooperatives for selection and imitation, and to help nearby agricultural cooperatives build factories to install components.
    In order to open up sales channels for sweet potatoes, the commercial department will, while doing a good job in purchasing and selling a portion of processed sweet potato products, also open a number of popular sweet potato canteens in cities and towns throughout the province, using sweet potatoes to make a variety of foods, and introducing a variety of ways to eat them to the masses. Candy and pastry shops in various places will also use a portion of sweet potatoes as raw materials.
    At present, preparations for arranging outlets for sweet potatoes have begun in various places. (Attached picture)

　　综合利用提高经济价值
　　山西四川已为薯类全面安排了出路
    本报讯　山西省对即将大丰收的山药蛋（马铃薯，下同）综合利用和加工保管问题已经作出全面规划安排，开始进行各项具体准备工作。
    山西省山药蛋（包括甘薯）的种植面积比去年扩大一倍多。现在，山药蛋生长良好，丰收大有希望。预计全省总产量可达二百亿到二百五十亿斤。平均每个农业人口一千四百斤，集中产区每人平均三千斤以上，显然是消费不了的。据省有关部门计算，除了人食口粮留下一定比例，农业社留下所需种籽和市镇居民需要供应统购一部分外，全省尚有一百五十多亿斤山药蛋需要通过加工制造来处理。
    由于山药蛋皮薄、水分大，容易腐烂，不好保管运输，加工制造就成为丰收后的一项复杂艰巨的任务了。根据这种情况，省有关部门从7月以来，就作过数次调查研究，总结推广先进经验。最近决定：第一，发动和协助种山药蛋的农业社举办粗制淀粉加工厂，制酒、制醋和制酱作坊约二万处。运用土法把淀粉渣酿成白酒和醋、酱，然后用酒糟、醋糟作牲口饲料，以达到综合连续利用。第二，将粗制淀粉加工成精制淀粉，将白酒提炼成酒精，以大量出口，供给纺织、造纸、印染、印刷、医药等部门作辅助原料，并供给副食、饮食业作粉条、糕点等。为此，全省计划新建大、中型精制淀粉厂六十个，每年可产精制淀粉三亿多斤。新建酒精加工厂二十个。每年产酒精五千五百万斤。新建酒精蒸馏站八十个，每年产酒精八千万斤。第三，生产价值高贵的化工原料和产品。计划生产丁醇、丙酮，制造酒精溶剂、丁苯橡胶和赛璐珞合剂。为此，计划在大同、太原新建和扩建以山药蛋为主要原料的化学厂。
    采取以上三种办法，一百五十亿斤山药蛋就可全部加工处理，综合利用。这样，不仅能够减少腐烂损失，还可大大发挥山药蛋的作用，给国家增添一笔巨大的财富。据初步计算，每一万斤山药蛋可制精粉一千六百斤，用粉渣提炼酒精三百二十五斤，共价值六百四十五元，比山药蛋原价高了一倍还多。如果用作化学工业原料，所产生的价值又比淀粉、酒精高二倍，比山药蛋原价高六倍。因此，各级领导部门对山药蛋的综合利用都很重视。省粮食厅、商业厅、轻工业厅最近集中研究解决了新建、扩建加工厂的资金、设备问题，规定各系统工厂分工负责，大力帮助。规定太原市水果加工厂、长治面粉厂和各县打蛋厂，根据生产情况，适当改建或扩建为兼制山药蛋淀粉厂。凡有发电、锅炉、烘干设备的属于其他系统的工厂，也要在统一规划下，承担一些精制淀粉的任务。山药蛋丰收后的运输、保管和综合利用中的技术问题，早在6月初召开的五寨会议上研究安排，现在，各专县有关部门，已着手改革运输工具、创造保管窟库、训练加工技术人材，争取收获以前作好全面准备。
    据新华社成都18日电　四川省今年红苕（甘薯）生长得又多又好，估计总产量将达到一千亿斤，约比去年增加三倍。今年全省生产的一千亿斤红苕的具体安排是：占70％以上的红苕掌握在农业社和农民手中，其中包括留种、饲料、口粮以及农民自由处理的部分；其余20％多由国家收购，抵作统购粮，其中除少部分鲜苕将随口粮配给城镇居民和机关干部外，大部分由当地设厂和由农业社加工制成酒类、酒精、淀粉、粉条、苕干，由粮食和商业部门收购。
    为了作好红苕加工和综合利用的组织领导和技术传授工作，粮食部门将在全省红苕产区建立一千个红苕淀粉加工厂和一千个酒精制造厂，工厂所需的机械和工具，采用土洋相结合的办法，由工业和手工业部门负责制造安装，向当地农民进行加工示范。工业、手工业部门还专门为农村红苕加工和综合利用创造出一批改良工具，如手摇、脚踏切片切丝机、粉碎机、烘干机、制酒用具、装酒容器，以及简便易造的小工具，供应农业社选购和仿造，并帮助附近农业社建立工厂安装机件。
    为了替红苕打开销路，商业部门在作好一部分红苕加工制成品的购销工作的同时，还将在全省城镇开设一部分大众化的红苕食堂，采用红苕制成各种食品，向群众介绍多种多样的吃法。各地糖果、糕点商店，也将采用一部分红苕作为原料。
    目前，为红苕安排出路的准备工作已在各地展开。（附图片）
