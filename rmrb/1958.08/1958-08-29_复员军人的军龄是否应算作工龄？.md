　　Should the Military Service of Demobilized Soldiers Be Counted as Working Experience?
    Question: Should the military service of demobilized construction soldiers be counted as working experience?
    Answer: The State Council's "Resolution on the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Soldiers" had provisions regarding this issue. The provisions stated: "For demobilized construction soldiers participating in work in government agencies and organizations… their military service should be counted as work history, and they should enjoy the same welfare benefits as general staff members in the same agency. For demobilized construction soldiers participating in work in factories, mines, and other enterprises, their military service should be counted as working experience and they should enjoy labor insurance benefits…" According to this regulation, the military service of all demobilized soldiers and discharged conscripts during their active duty period can be calculated as continuous working experience in their work units. However, the period spent in their hometowns after leaving the military and before starting work should not be calculated as working experience. If they resign after starting work and then register for employment through the labor department, both their military service period and their working experience before resignation will be counted as general working experience.

　　复员军人的军龄是否应算作工龄？
    问：复员建设军人的军龄是否可算作工龄？
    答：关于这个问题，国务院“关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”中曾有规定。规定说：“对参加机关团体工作的复员建设军人……其军龄应当算做参加工作的历史，同一般工作人员一样享受本机关的福利待遇。对参加厂矿等企业部门工作的复员建设军人，其军龄应当算做工龄享受劳保待遇……。”按照这一规定，凡参加工作的复员军人和退伍义务兵，在服现役期间的军龄，可以计算为本工作单位的连续工龄。但在离开部队后至参加工作前的在乡期间，不得计算为工龄。如果参加工作后退职，又经劳动部门登记就业的，其在服现役期间的军龄和退职前的工龄，均为一般工龄。
