    Heaven and Earth Net
    ——Record of Annihilation of US-Chiang Kai-shek Airborne Special Agents
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xiu Ping, Fu Pu, Ji Ning
    On the night of July 3, 1958, a twin-engine American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft sneaked into the airspace over Qinbei Zhuang Autonomous County, Guangdong Province. The members of Shangwen Township in Qinbei Zhuang Autonomous County were taking advantage of the moonlight to carry out the summer harvest and planting in full swing. The rattling of the engine broke the silence of the summer night, and people quickly discovered this intruding enemy plane circling in the sky. The people here have experience in fighting the enemy. In 1956, they completely wiped out a batch of US-Chiang Kai-shek airborne special agents. As soon as they discovered this unusual plane, they became alert, and people searched every corner of the sky with their naked eyes. Sure enough, several dark little clumps slowly descended from mid-air. Immediately, telephone bells rang in various surrounding townships, and dense crowds of farmers, militiamen, and cadres, holding hoes and guns, rushed to the landing site of the airborne special agents. Everywhere there were shouts of "Catch the airborne special agents!" "Don't let a single airborne special agent escape!" The mountains and fields were filled with people. Public security personnel and troops were dispatched. A commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who was ill, immediately led his troops and ran more than forty miles to the scene within two hours. Students, women, and children were also dispatched to guard and patrol. In this way, the special agents were completely trapped in the heaven and earth net of the broad masses.

    At the first glimmer of dawn, people quickly discovered the radio station and supplies dropped from the enemy plane. But the cunning enemy was not found, and the angry masses surrounded the airborne area like an iron barrel.

    Public security personnel, police, and garrison troops from Hepu Special District, Qin County, and Qinbei Zhuang Autonomous County, as well as nearby militiamen, arrived in the airborne area. After on-site observation and judgment, a large-scale and comprehensive search operation began. At 8:00 AM on the 4th, Huang Daqin, a cadre from Shangwen Township, Gui Shuyang, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of Haishan Agricultural Cooperative, Fang Jinlie, director of Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative, and Fang Shanhui, a member of the cooperative, were patrolling in the field when they suddenly saw a person holding a weapon and looking flustered coming towards them. As soon as this person saw people in front of him, he ran away. So everyone bravely chased after him. When they reached a small river, this person disappeared again. After a careful search, they finally found this special agent hiding in a ditch, exposing his nose to breathe on the surface of the water. This special agent was captured like a drowned rat.

    This special agent was named Liu Jianlong, the radio station chief of Group C3 of the "Intelligence Bureau's Guangdong-South Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Airborne Group" dispatched by the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent agency. From Liu Jianlong's confession, it was learned that there was also a group leader named Huang Jiali. At this time, the morale of the masses was even higher, and forces were immediately deployed to search in remote areas.

    It turned out that Huang Jiali, who had been frightened by the shouts of the masses on the ground while parachuting in mid-air, dropped his backpack and leather shoes after landing. Wearing socks, he fled to the pigsty by the village to hide. In the midst of the uproar, he felt that he could not hide, and this cunning special agent mixed into the crowd, shouting and trying to escape. He temporarily escaped at that time. This special agent hid in the mountains all day long, and it was not until the night of the 4th, when he was unbearable with hunger and thirst, that he sneaked into the remote Liuren Village and sneaked into the farmer Pan Shankai's house to drink water. As soon as Pan Shankai saw this bad guy arrive, he quickly shouted loudly: "Catch the special agent!" Many farmers and militiamen rushed to the scene immediately. Huang was just about to flee when he was blocked by the students from Changtan Middle School who were participating in the guard, so he had to hide in the toilet. Under the encirclement of public security personnel and troops, Huang Jiali surrendered.

    At the same time, the farmers of Shangsi County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also captured Huang Kexiang, the leader of another airborne "Group C2". This special agent landed in Shangsi County, eight miles away from the county seat. The local farmers were holding a conference, and Huang Kexiang happened to land in a broken house next to the venue. The farmers immediately surrounded the broken house and ordered him to come out. This special agent, as stupid as a pig, still thought it was the welcome of the "anti-communist people" and shamelessly shouted: "My name is Huang Zuoyi (the name he used to use locally), don't you recognize me?"

    "What Huang Zuoyi or not Huang Zuoyi, quickly hand over your gun." The masses were both amused and angry, and sternly ordered him.

    It was not until this time that this special agent discovered that the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent agency's claim that "airdropping into the mainland will be welcomed by the anti-communist people" was a complete lie. He was so frightened that he lost his soul, and was finally captured alive like a pig. (Photo attached)

    ——围歼美蒋空投特务记
    新华社记者　修平　复溥　继宁
    1958年7月3日深夜，一架双引擎的美制蒋机偷偷地窜入广东省钦北僮族自治县的上空。钦北僮族自治县上纹乡的社员们正在趁着月色紧张地进行夏收夏种。轧轧的机声冲破了夏夜的寂静，人们很快发现了这一架窜进来的敌机正在空中盘旋。这里的人们是有对敌斗争经验的，他们曾经在1956年全歼过一批美蒋空投特务，他们一发现这架不平常的飞机，便警觉起来，人们用肉眼搜索着天空的每一角落。果然，几个黑黑的小团从半空徐徐地降下。顿时，周围各个乡的电话铃都响起来，密密麻麻的农民、民兵和干部，拿着锄头、持着枪向空投特务降落的地点奔去，到处都响着“抓住空降特务呀！”“不要放走一个空降特务！”的呼喊声，漫山遍野出现了人群。公安人员和部队出动了，人民解放军某部的指挥员正在生病，也立刻带着队伍在两小时内跑了四十多里路赶到现场。学生们、妇女们、儿童们也都出动警戒巡逻。这样，特务分子完全陷进了广大群众的天罗地网中。
    天还蒙蒙亮，人们很快地发现了从敌机上投下来的电台、物资。但是没有发现狡猾的敌人，愤怒的群众便像铁桶般地把空投地区团团地包围起来。
    合浦专区、钦县和钦北僮族自治县的公安人员、民警和驻军以及附近的民兵都到了空降地区，经过现场观察、判断以后，一次大规模的全面的搜索活动便开始了。4日上午八时，上纹乡的干部黄大钦，海山农业社团支部书记归树昂、三联农业社主任方金烈、社员方善辉等几个人正在野外巡逻，突然看见一个拿着武器、神态慌张的人迎面而来，这个人一看到前面有人就拔脚飞奔。于是大家奋勇猛追，追到一条小河的时候，这个人又不见了。大家仔细地进行搜索，终于发现这个特务分子躲在水沟里，露出鼻子在水面上吸气，这个特务便像一只落汤鸡一样束手就擒了。
    这个特务名叫刘剑龙，是美蒋特务机关派遣的“情报局粤南反共救国军空降组”C三组电台台长。从刘剑龙的口供中，知道了还有一个组长叫黄佳利。这时，群众的斗志更加旺盛，立刻布置力量向偏僻的地区进行搜索。
    原来，在跳伞到半空时就被地面上的群众呼喊声吓昏了的黄佳利，降落后连背包和皮鞋也扔掉了，他穿着袜子逃到村边的猪栏去躲藏起来。在人声鼎沸中，他觉得藏不下去了，这个狡猾的特务分子便混在群众的队伍中一面喊叫，一面逃命。当时被他暂时逃脱了。这个特务分子整天躲在山林里，一直到4日的晚上在饥渴难熬的情况下，才偷偷地窜到偏僻的六稔村里，摸进农民潘善开家里喝水。潘善开一看见这个坏家伙到来，便连忙高声叫喊道：“抓特务！”许多农民和民兵立刻赶到，黄匪刚刚想要逃窜，碰到长滩中学参加守卫的学生们的堵截，只好躲进厕所里去，在公安人员和部队的包围下，黄佳利俯首就擒了。
    在同一个时间里，广西僮族自治区上思县的农民，把另一个空投下来的“C二组”组长黄科祥也抓住了。这个特务分子是在上思县距离县城八里的地方降落的。当地农民正在举行大会，黄科祥就恰好降落在会场旁边一间破房子里。农民立刻包围了这座破房，喝令他出来。这个其蠢如猪的特务分子还以为是“反共民众”的欢迎，无耻地叫着：“我叫黄作仪（是他过去在当地用的名字），你们不认识我吗？”
    “什么黄作仪不黄作仪，赶快把枪交出来。”群众又好笑又愤怒，严厉地命令他。
    这个特务分子到这时才发现美蒋特务机关所说的“空投大陆会受到反共民众的欢迎”，原来是彻头彻尾的谎话，他吓得丧魂落魄，最后终于被像捉猪一样地活捉了。（附图片）
