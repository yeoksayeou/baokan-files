Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: According to TASS, the puppies "Belyanka" (Little White) and "Pustraya" (Little Colorful), launched by rocket to an altitude of 450 kilometers on August 27, are in good condition after returning to Earth.

Prior to this record-breaking flight, the two puppies underwent several months of continuous training. They each weigh about eight kilograms.

According to the biologists who trained them to adapt to the flight, the two animals had become so accustomed to the sealed cabin, instruments, and flight environment that they could enter the sealed cabin quietly on their own. Therefore, the data obtained by the biologists from the experiment did not contain any distortions. These data reflected the activity and functional status of animals and organisms under the conditions of flying at such high altitudes. (Attached picture)

　　两只小狗从九百里高空安返预定地点
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：8月27日由火箭发射到四百五十公里高空的小狗“别梁卡”（小白）和“彪斯特拉亚”（小花），回到地面以后情况良好。
    在这次破纪录的飞行以前，对这两个小狗进行了连续几个月的训练。它们各重八公斤左右。
    据训练它们适应飞行的生物学家说，这两个动物已经非常习惯于密封舱、仪器设备和飞行环境，以致它们自己能安静地进入密封舱内。因此，生物学家从实验得到的资料没有掺杂任何失真现象。这些资料反映了在这样高的高空从事飞行的条件下动物和机体的活动及其机能的状况。（附图片）
