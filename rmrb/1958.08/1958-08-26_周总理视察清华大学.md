　　Premier Zhou Inspects Tsinghua University

　　On the afternoon of August 24th, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Tsinghua University. He toured the graduation design exhibition of Tsinghua University's graduating class and met with the 1,432 graduating students who had just completed five years of study and were about to embark on their careers.

　　Premier Zhou, accompanied by President Jiang Nanxiang and First Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Liu Bing, approached the boiler-locomotive machine tool placed at the entrance of the exhibition hall.

　　**The Youth Must Catch Up**

　　The guide explained: "This boiler-locomotive machine tool was made from waste materials by students of the Steam 8 class of the Department of Power Machinery, demonstrating the spirit of hard work and perseverance. This one-meter-long rack with more than eighty teeth was painstakingly made with shovels and files over a day and a night." Premier Zhou shook the hand of Luo Zesheng, the student who filed the rack, and said: "Excellent!"

　　The Premier praised Luo Zesheng and asked, "How old are you?"

　　"Twenty-four years old," Luo Zesheng replied. Seeing the Premier's kind concern for the students, he naturally began to converse with the Premier. The Premier also asked about his hometown and studies. He also encouraged the students, saying:

　　"The youth must catch up."

　　As Premier Zhou entered the exhibition room of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, the guide, student Jiang Wenqin, greeted him. The Premier cordially shook her hand. Premier Zhou had personally visited Miyun to inspect the Miyun Reservoir, which the students of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering had participated in designing. Therefore, he was very familiar with the "Overall Model Diagram of the Actual Combat Results of Graduation Design" exhibited at the exhibition. He took the pointer from the guide and enthusiastically pointed to the dam opening of the Miyun Reservoir model, saying:

　　"Ah! I have been here and met with some of your teachers and students. Did you all participate?"

　　"We all went," the students replied.

　　"Oh, you all participated! Has construction started yet?" The Premier continued to inquire with great concern. One of the students rushed to answer the Premier's question:

　　"Construction has already started. We returned to participate in the graduation design defense, and the fourth-year students took over our construction tasks."

　　"You're not taking care of it anymore? You should also go and do some labor!" the Premier said humorously with a smile. Then, he pointed to the two gaps on the Miyun Reservoir model and asked the guide: "Have the gaps been blocked? If they are not blocked, it will leak!" When she replied that they had been blocked, the Premier smiled with satisfaction.

　　**Not Only Build Reservoirs, But Also Build Ditches**

　　The Premier followed the indicator lights to look at other reservoirs. He returned the pointer to the guide and then said to everyone:

　　"There are too few ditches in greater Beijing, it's empty. I have been to the South, like Jiangsu, Anhui... the ditches are so dense. If there are fewer ditches, the crops will be sparse." The Premier turned to Jiang Wenqin and asked: "Can you build more ditches? This is your responsibility. You should not only build reservoirs, but also build ditches. Would it be good to entrust the task of ditching Beijing to you?"

　　"Yes! This is the task of our hydraulic construction workers. Let our department's hydraulic engineering design institute handle it." Several students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering answered the Premier very affirmatively. Then, the Premier flipped through the teaching syllabus. President Jiang said to the Premier: "This was formulated by the students based on their personal experience." The Premier said with a smile: "That's very good, you can be teaching assistants."

　　Premier Zhou arrived at the second exhibition room, where the No. 205 soil cement products were displayed. The students told the Premier that the laboratory had reached No. 400, but it was unstable. The Premier said: "Very good! If you can achieve a stable No. 300 soil cement, I will go and accept orders for you. You should come up with an opinion on a plant that can produce 1,000 to 2,000 tons per year, from design, raw materials to manufacturing methods. I will order it." The students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering next to him immediately replied: "We will definitely make it!"

　　Various exquisite electron tubes were placed on the white display cabinet in the exhibition room of the Department of Radio Electronics. Student Wang Fengming introduced to Premier Zhou the electron tube that uses copper-clad steel wire tin-coated instead of nickel tube needles, which can reduce the use of twenty tons of nickel per year and save 1.04 million yuan in foreign exchange. The Premier picked up the copper-clad steel wire tube needle electron tube and asked: "How is the quality?" Wang Fengming replied: "Very good, the same as the nickel tube needle!" The Premier nodded with satisfaction.

　　In the exhibition room of the Department of Electrical Engineering, student Wang Bohan introduced to the Premier the locally made high-voltage oil switch made by the students themselves. They used water tanks instead of iron oil tanks and soybean oil instead of transformer oil. The price of a "foreign switch" is 700 yuan, while the price of a "local switch" is only 60 yuan.

　　"Oh, only 60 yuan?" The Premier bent down and carefully looked at the structure of the "local switch." He found a ping-pong ball in the oil tank. At this time, Wang Bohan immediately explained to the Premier that the ping-pong ball is connected to a thin rod, and the amount of oil in the tank can be seen from the rise and fall of the rod, which is used to replace the glass on the "foreign switch." The Premier happily asked: "Did you come up with it yourself?" Wang Bohan nodded with a smile.

　　When the students of the Department of Civil Engineering heard the Premier's laughter in the distance, they were both happy and nervous. When the Premier walked in front of the model of the radio tower designed by Lai Jinyan, he said humorously: "Oh! The surname is Lai, a strange surname?" This made everyone laugh and immediately felt less nervous. Chen Shunyao, deputy secretary of the school party committee, said: "Let Lai Jinyan talk about it himself." Lai Jinyan said that the mast tower in capitalist countries requires more than 70 tons of steel, while his design only uses more than 11 tons. The Premier looked at the model carefully and said: "Ah, the difference is so big! How can it be saved?" After Lai Jinyan explained the characteristics of his design, the Premier asked: "Has the expert confirmed it?" Lai Jinyan replied: "Confirmed, the industrial sector has also adopted it." The Premier nodded.

　　The Premier saw the paper air duct made by the students of the Department of Civil Engineering and said: "What is this?" The guide Zhang Lansheng explained that the paper air duct can replace steel, and has the advantages of fire resistance and water resistance. The Premier asked:

　　"What kind of paper is it made of?"

　　The student replied that it was made of wood pulp paper treated with sulfuric acid. The Premier asked again:

　　"Are other materials okay? Is bagasse pulp okay? Is rice straw pulp okay?"

　　"We haven't tried it yet." Zhang Lansheng replied somewhat ashamed, while thinking in his heart: "The Premier's knowledge is really broad!"

　　**Can We Design a Commune with the Lowest Cost?**

　　As soon as he saw the drawings of the library, canteen, lecture hall, and office building designed by the students of the Department of Civil Engineering for Renmin University, the Premier said:

　　"Can you design a canteen for the State Council?" Then he talked with great interest:

　　"The State Council wants to run a canteen, run a nursery... I'm placing an order with you." At this time, the students felt as close as chatting with the Premier. The Premier asked again:

　　"How much does your design cost per square meter?" Because the designer was not there, the students could not answer. The guide Li Yingshu thought to himself: "Oh no, how come we didn't think about this important question when we were preparing! Our economic perspective is still too poor."

　　The Premier asked again: "Can you design a commune with the lowest cost? I will give you a list when I go back, give you an indicator, and you can see what the lowest cost is?"

　　When the students heard that this task was going to be handed over to them, they were very excited. The Premier asked twice "Is it okay?" Everyone was thinking "No problem at all", and everyone wanted to rush to tell the Premier:

　　"Yes, yes!"

　　President Jiang Nanxiang said: "They have a design institute and a construction company." Immediately, a student then said: "Our design institute can take it!"

　　The Premier finally arrived at the exhibition room of the Department of Power Machinery. When he saw the "Model of the Demonstration Power Plant for Comprehensive Utilization of Fuel" that the school was building, he inquired in detail about the power generation, investment, and raw materials of the plant. He also asked how many kinds of products this power plant can produce. The students replied that in addition to power generation, it can also produce five by-products such as cement, tar, diesel, phenol, and gas. The Premier said:

　　"Good, a total of six products. This kind of power plant should be promoted." Then, he walked to the miniature car made by the teachers, students, and workers of the Department of Power Machinery.

　　The guide told the Premier: "If you take this car from Tsinghua University to Qianmen, it costs the same as a three-wheeler for one person, and it's half the price for two people."

　　The Premier said: "Very good, it can be used to replace three-wheelers. You should use the lowest cost and the easiest to find materials to make this car. This is thinking for communism. This can be promoted."

　　**Socialists Must Always Combine Learning, Work, and Production Together**

　　When Premier Zhou came out of the exhibition hall, all 1,432 graduating students had gathered neatly at the entrance. 1,432 pairs of eyes were facing Premier Zhou. They clapped, cheered, and jumped enthusiastically. They were so eager for Premier Zhou to say a few words, just like a child about to go on a long journey expects the mother's instructions.

　　At this time, President Jiang Nanxiang walked to the loudspeaker and announced that Premier Zhou was going to speak to the graduating students. The students immediately clapped, cheered, and jumped even more enthusiastically. But immediately, they calmed down and listened carefully. The Premier said:

　　"I have seen your exhibition. I think you have combined education and production, learning and labor, and implemented the policy put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao. So I am here to visit and combine with this policy, how to combine it? I am here to place an order. Students in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering should design the water conservancy of Greater Beijing well. I propose that you do ditch design. It is not enough to have only small and medium-sized dams, but also to make Beijing ditched. After seeing your architectural engineering design, I also placed an order with you to design the State Council dormitory. There is also your comprehensive utilization power plant... There are also a few things that I want to order. We will sort out a few lists when we go back. Today, I not only come to see you graduating students, but also combine with your work and place an order with you. This is my main gain from the visit, and it is also a learning.

　　I hope that when you go to your work posts, you will further integrate the Party's policy of combining learning and labor, education and production into practice, because we socialists, all the way to communist society, are like this. Throughout our lives, we must always combine learning, work, and production together. From small to old, we are not only cultured laborers, but also socialist members who can combine mental and physical labor. This policy is now reflected in your learning, and it should also be reflected in your work, and reflected in your long-term work. Because it is through you, and only through your younger generation, that socialist China will be built, and then transition to communist society. In communist society, we must continue to advance, advance, and advance again."

　　Every word of the Premier was deeply imprinted in the hearts of the graduating students.

　　At six o'clock, Premier Zhou left, and the applause did not stop until the car could not be seen. They turned around and ran to the dormitory, to the dining hall, to the places where there were many people, to spread their excited mood to everyone.

　　At night, every class held a discussion.

　　The students said:

　　"The Premier's speech pointed out the direction of lifelong struggle for us. The Premier's order not only set our task today, but also set our task for life. We must be communist laborers who always combine learning, work, and production together from small to old."

　　When someone suggested to the students of the Department of Civil Engineering that they were about to graduate, and the design of the State Council dormitory could be left to the next class of students, they immediately objected:

　　"No! We must take it down immediately!"

　　"You won't have time!"

　　"Fight hard for ten days! Don't leave school until the task is completed!"

　　The Party Committee of the Department of Civil Engineering also discussed Premier Zhou's important instructions to the Department of Civil Engineering overnight. Liu Xiaoshi, the secretary of the Party Committee, said:

　　"How far-sighted the Premier is! He understands the Department of Civil Engineering more clearly than we do. The Premier's task of designing a commune for the students of the Department of Civil Engineering is an inspiring task, pointing out the direction of the department, pointing out the role of our profession in communist construction, and greatly encouraging students to love their profession. We must mobilize the strength of the entire department to achieve the goals set by the Premier for us."

　　This was not a dark night, but a boiling night. In the hearts of this group of young people, they repeatedly reviewed the Premier's cordial meeting and valuable instructions.

　　"We must always remember the Party's words. Advance to communism, advance, and advance again." (Attached picture)

　　周总理视察清华大学
    8月24日下午，周恩来总理来到了清华园。参观了清华大学应届毕业生的毕业设计展览会，并会见了刚刚结束了五年学习，即将走上工作岗位的一千四百三十二个今年的毕业同学。
    周总理在蒋南翔校长和党委第一副书记刘冰等同志的陪同下，走到了放在展览会门口的锅驼机床面前。
    就要靠青年人赶上前去
    讲解员讲解说：“这台锅驼机床是动力机械系汽8同学发扬穷干苦干精神，用废料制成的。这一公尺长、八十多个齿的齿条是用铲子和挫刀苦战一昼夜制成的。”周总理握住挫齿条的罗泽圣同学的手说：“好极了！”
    总理赞扬了罗泽圣，又问“二十几了？”
    “二十四岁。”罗泽圣同学回答。他看见总理对同学们这样亲切的关怀，也就很自然地和总理交谈起来。总理还问了他的家乡和学习情况。还鼓励同学们说：
    “就要靠你们青年人赶上前去。”
    周总理一走进水利系展览室，讲解员江文琴同学就迎了上去，总理亲切地和她握了手。周总理曾经亲自到密云考察过水利系同学们参加设计的密云水库，所以对展览会上展出的水利系“真刀真枪毕业设计战果总体模型图”很熟悉。他从讲解员手里拿过了讲解棒，就兴致勃勃地指着密云水库模型的坝口说：
    “啊！我到过这里，还会见了你们的一部分教师和同学。你们都参加了吗？”
    “我们都去了”。同学们回答。
    “噢，你们都参加了！开工了没有呢？”总理十分关切地继续询问。不知哪位同学抢先回答了总理的问话：
    “已经开工了，我们回来参加毕业设计答辩，由四年级同学接替了我们的施工任务”。
    “你们就不管了？你们也应该去劳动劳动嘛！”总理含着笑风趣地说。接着他又指着密云水库模型上的两个缺口问讲解员：“缺口堵了没有？不堵要漏的啊！”当她回答已经堵住了时，总理满意地笑了。
　　不但要修水库，还要修沟渠
    总理顺着指示灯看了其它水库。把讲解棒还给了讲解员，然后向大家说：
    “大北京沟渠太少，空空的，我去过南方，像江苏、安徽……沟渠都是那样密密麻麻的，沟渠少了，庄稼就会稀稀拉拉的。”总理回过头问江文琴：“能多修一些沟渠吗？这是你们的责任，你们不但要修水库，还要修沟渠。把北京沟渠化的任务交给你们好不好？”
    “好！这是我们水利建设者的任务。由我们系的水工设计院来搞。”在场的几位水利系同学十分肯定地回答了总理。接着总理翻阅了教学大纲。蒋校长对总理说：“这是同学根据切身体会制订出来的。”总理笑着说：“那很好啊，可以做助教了。”
    周总理来到了第二个展览室，这里陈列着二○五号土水泥的产品。同学告诉总理，实验室里曾经达到过四○○号，但不稳定。总理说：“很好啊！能达到稳定的三○○号土水泥，我就去替你们接受订货。你们搞一个可以年产一千到二千吨的厂。从设计、原材料到制造方法都提出个意见来，我订货。”在旁边的水利系同学马上回答：“我们一定把它做出来！”
    无线电电子学系展览室的白色展品柜上放置着各种精制的电子管。王凤鸣同学向周总理介绍了以铜包钢丝煮锡代替镍管针的电子管，每年可少用二十吨镍，省一百零四万元的外汇。总理拿起了铜包钢丝管针的电子管问：“质量怎么样？”王凤鸣回答说：“很好，和镍管针一样！”总理满意地点点头。
    在电机系展览室里，王伯翰同学向总理介绍了同学自制的土造高压油开关。他们用水缸代替铁油箱，用豆油代替变压器油。“洋开关”的价格是七百元，而“土开关”的价格只有六十元。
    “哦，只有六十元？”总理哈下腰，细致地看“土开关”的构造。发现油缸里有个乒乓球。这时王伯翰马上给总理讲解说，这个乒乓球连着一个细杆，由杆子的升降，就可以看出缸里的油量多少，用来代替“洋开关”上的玻璃。总理高兴地问：“是你们自己想出来的吧？”王伯翰含笑地点点头。
    土木系的同学，当听见总理在远处的笑声时，心里又高兴又紧张。当总理走到来晋炎设计的无线电塔的模型前面时，风趣地说道：“哦！姓来，姓得这么怪？”引得大家都笑起来，立刻感到不那么紧张了。校党委副书记陈舜瑶同志说：“让来晋炎自己讲讲吧。”来晋炎讲述了资本主义国家的桅杆塔要用七十多吨钢，而他的设计只用十一吨多，总理又仔细看了看模型说：“啊，差这么多！怎么会省的？”来晋炎讲解了他的设计的特点后，总理又问：“专家肯定了吗？”来晋炎回答说：“肯定了，产业部门也已经采用。”总理点点头。
    总理看见土木系同学做的纸风道说：“这是什么？”讲解员张兰生讲述了纸风道可以代替钢材，有耐火、耐水的优点。总理问：
    “用什么纸做的？”
    同学回答是用硫酸处理过的木浆纸做的。总理又问：
    “别的材料行吗？甘蔗浆行吗？稻草浆行吗？”
    “我们还没有试过。”张兰生一面有些惭愧地回答，一面心里想：“总理的知识真是渊博啊！”
    能不能够用最低的造价设计一个公社
    一看见土木系同学为人民大学设计的图书馆、食堂、阶梯教室、办公楼的图纸，总理说：
    “你们能不能为国务院设计一个食堂？”接着就兴致勃勃地谈了起来：
    “国务院要办食堂，办托儿所……我向你们定货。这时候同学们觉得像是在和总理聊天一样那么亲切。总理又问：
    “你们的设计每平方公尺造价多少？”因为设计的人不在，这下同学们可回答不上来了，讲解员李应塾心里直想：“糟糕，怎么准备的时候，就没有想到这个重要的问题！还是我们经济观点太差。”
    总理又问：“你们能不能够用最低的造价设计一个公社？我回去给你们开个单子来，提个指标，你们看看最低造价多少？”
    同学们一听说要把这个任务交给他们，都兴奋极了，总理问了两次“行不行？”大家心里都想着“完全没问题”，谁都想抢着告诉总理：
    “行啊，行啊！”
    蒋南翔校长说：“他们有个设计院和建筑公司。”马上有个同学接着说：“我们设计院可以包！”
    总理最后到了动力系展览室。他看到学校正在兴建的“燃料综合利用示范电厂的模型”时，详细地询问了这个厂的发电量、投资、原料等问题。还问这个电厂可以出产多少种产品。同学们回答除了发电外还可以生产水泥、焦油、柴油、酚、瓦斯等五种副产品。总理说：
    “好，一共六种产品。这种电厂要推广一下。”然后，他又走到动力系师生师工制造的微型汽车旁边。
    讲解员向总理说：“这种汽车如果从清华园坐到前门，坐一个人和三轮车等价，坐两个人就便宜一半。”
    总理说：“很好，可以用来代替三轮，你们要用最低的成本，最容易找的材料来做这种汽车，这就是为共产主义着想。这可以推广。”
    社会主义者一生都要使学习、工作、生产永远结合在一起
    当周总理从展览会出来的时候，全体一千四百三十二个毕业同学都已经整齐地集合在门口了。一千四百三十二双眼睛都向着周总理，他们热情地鼓着掌，欢呼着，跳跃着。他们是那样迫切地期望周总理能够讲几句话，像即将出门远征的孩子期望着母亲的嘱咐一样。
    这时候，蒋南翔校长走到扩音机前面，宣布周总理要向毕业同学讲话。同学们立刻更热烈地鼓掌、欢呼、跳跃起来。但是立刻，他们安静下来，仔细地聆听着。总理说：
    “我看了你们的展览会。我想你们是把教育和生产结合起来了，学习跟劳动结合起来了，实行了党和毛主席提出的这个方针。那末我来参观也要和这个方针结合，怎么结合呢？我就来订货，你们水利系同学就要把大北京的水利设计好，我提议你们搞沟渠设计。光有中小型的水坝还不够，还要使北京沟渠化。看了你们建筑工程设计，我也跟你们订货，要你们设计国务院宿舍。还有你们的综合利用电厂……还有几样东西也要订货。我们回去再整理几个单子来。今天不仅来看你们毕业同学，并且又和你们的工作结合起来，向你们订货，这是我参观的主要收获，也是个学习。
    希望你们到工作岗位上去更加把党的学习和劳动结合、教育和生产结合的方针连系到实际中去，因为我们社会主义者，一直到共产主义社会都是这样，一生都要使学习、工作、生产永远结合在一起，从小到老，既是一个有文化的劳动者，又是一个能够使脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的社会主义分子，这个方针现在体现在你们学习中，也要体现在你们工作中，体现在你们长期的工作中。因为要经过你们，也只有经过你们年青一代，把中国社会主义建成，以后过渡到共产主义社会。在共产主义社会中，还要前进，前进，再前进”。
    总理的每一句话，每一个字都深深地印在毕业同学的心中。
    六点钟，周总理走了，人们的掌声直到汽车看不见了的时候才停止。他们又转过身来向宿舍、向饭厅、向着人多的地方跑，要把自己激动的心情传播给每个人。
    夜里，班班都开了座谈会。
    同学们说：
    “总理的讲话，给我们指出了终生奋斗的方向。总理的定货，不仅定了我们今天的任务，而且也定了我们一生的任务。我们要从小到老，做一个学习、工作、生产永远结合在一起的共产主义劳动者。”
    当有人对土木系的同学提议：他们马上毕业了，国务院的宿舍设计可以留给下一班同学做时，他们立刻表示反对：
    “不！我们要马上包下来！”
    “你们来不及了啊！”
    “苦战十天！不完成任务不离校！”
    土木系的分党委会也连夜讨论了周总理对土木系的重要指示。分党委书记刘小石同志说：
    “总理看得多么远！他了解土木系比我们了解的更清楚。总理提出的要土木系同学设计公社的任务，是一个振奋人心的任务，指出了系的方向，指出了我们的专业在共产主义建设中的作用，大大鼓舞同学们热爱自己的专业。我们一定要动员全系的力量，来实现总理给我们提出的目标”。
    这是一个不黑的夜晚，沸腾的夜晚。在这群年青人的心里，反复地温习着总理对他们的亲切的会见和宝贵的指示。
    “我们一定要永远记住党的话。向共产主义前进，前进，再前进。”（附图片）
