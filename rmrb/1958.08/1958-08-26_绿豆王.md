    Green Bean King

    In Youcaitang Cooperative, Xintian County, Hunan Province, a "Green Bean King" plant was discovered. This "Green Bean King" was obtained by hybridizing luffa and green beans. The plant is three feet tall, with a stem as thick as jute. Its leaves resemble luffa leaves, and it bears eight pods. The pods are six to seven inches long and two inches in circumference. Each pod has eight rows of seeds, with forty to forty-three seeds in each row. The seeds are large and full (7,400+ seeds weigh one *jin*, while local green beans require 12,500+ seeds to weigh one *jin*). The fact that plants from different genera can be successfully hybridized needs further research by agricultural scientists.

    绿豆王
    湖南新田县油菜塘社，发现一株“绿豆王”。这株“绿豆王”是用丝瓜和绿豆杂交得来的，株高三尺，茎秆粗像黄麻，叶像丝瓜叶，结荚八个，荚长六、七寸，荚围二寸，每荚有八排籽，每排籽四十—四十三粒，粒大饱满（七千四百多粒有一斤重，而当地绿豆要一万二千五百多粒才有一斤重）。不同科属的植物也能杂交成功这个事实，有待农业科学家研究。
