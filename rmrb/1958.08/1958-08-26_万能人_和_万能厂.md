　　“All-Rounders” and “All-Purpose Factories”
    In order to better develop agricultural production, agricultural cooperatives also need to establish a batch of factories that directly serve agriculture. Such as: fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, farm tool plants, hydropower stations... But, setting up factories requires people, technology, and equipment. How to solve these problems?
    Xuguang First Cooperative in Echeng County, Hubei Province, launched the "All-Rounder" movement to cultivate "all-rounders" who not only master the full range of agricultural techniques but also several industrial skills. This points the way for agricultural cooperatives to solve the problems of manpower and technology in running industries. Today, the news published in this newspaper about the Dongfeng Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an, "One Set of Equipment, Multiple Uses," provides a way to solve the problem of insufficient equipment.
    The Dongfeng Cooperative uses extremely simple equipment—a pot, some vats and gasoline drums, baskets, ropes, etc.—to manufacture granular fertilizer, indigenous fertilizer, and pesticides, and also to produce the chemical raw material, furfural. This small granular fertilizer plant can "serve multiple roles," which is "one factory for multiple purposes," and can be given a glorious title—"All-Purpose Factory."
    Here, we might as well calculate: If every granular fertilizer plant in the country could be like this one, using one set of equipment and one team of people to produce three, four, or even more products; if every commune member were like the "all-rounders" of Xuguang First Cooperative, mastering multiple skills, being both workers and farmers, then the difficulties of equipment, manpower, and technology could not only be easily solved, but also play an inestimable positive role.
    We should advocate cultivating "all-rounders" in large numbers and building "all-purpose factories" everywhere.

### “万能人”和“万能厂”

　　“万能人”和“万能厂”
    为了更好地发展农业生产，农业社也需要办一批直接为农业服务的工厂。如：肥料厂、农药厂、农具厂、水电站……。可是，办工厂就需要人，需要技术，需要设备。怎样解决这些问题？
    湖北鄂城县旭光一社开展“万能人”运动，培养既会全套农业技术又会几项工业技术的“万能人”，这对农业社办工业解决人力和技术的问题指出了方向。今天本报发表的西安市郊东风社“一套设备，多种用处”的消息，又提供了解决设备不足的办法。
    东风社用极简单的一些设备——一口锅、一些缸和汽油桶、筐子、绳子等，既能制造颗粒肥料，又能制造土化肥和农药，还能生产化工原料——糠醛。这个小小的颗粒肥料厂竟能“一身数任”，这就是“一厂多用”，可以给它一个光荣的称号——“万能厂”。
    这里，我们不妨计算一下，如果全国每一个颗粒肥料厂都能像这个厂一样，它们都能利用一套设备，一套人马，生产三种、四种，甚至更多种产品；如果每个社员也都像旭光一社的“万能人”一样，一人会多种技术，亦工亦农，那么，设备、人力和技术困难不仅可以迎刃而解，而且还能发挥难以估计的积极作用。
    我们应该提倡大量培养“万能人”，多多办“万能厂”。
