Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 31st – The State Statistical Bureau recently held a national on-site conference on statistics in Baoding, proposing that under the leadership of the Party, relying on local areas, and relying on the masses, to achieve statistics by the whole people, and working hard for three months to completely change the face of statistical work across the country. The conference determined to further promote the experience of Hebei Province in reforming statistical work nationwide, so that statistical work is closely integrated with the political and production movements of the masses, and fully plays the role of promoting production.

The representatives attending the meeting listened to reports from Hu Kaiming, Deputy Governor of Hebei Province, and responsible cadres from relevant regions within the province, and visited nearly a hundred grassroots units' statistical work in six special districts including Chengde and Handan. They saw here that leaders of Party and government at all levels attached great importance to statistical work, and many Party secretaries and county heads personally grasped statistical work; statistical work could promptly reflect the progress of production, becoming an important basis for Party and government leading organs to direct production; the broad masses frequently used statistical data to evaluate production, and the representatives unanimously believed that Hebei Province had established a banner for the great leap forward in statistical work in our country.

The conference summarized the experience of Hebei Province in reforming statistical work. Hebei's experience mainly has three points: First, to do a good job in statistical work, statistical organs and statistical cadres at all levels must first clearly understand the nature and tasks of statistical work. Hebei Province uses statistical work as a tool to serve political struggles and production struggles. In this way, statistical work is not isolated to do regular reports, but is closely combined with the vigorous real-world struggles, so that it can not only meet the needs of the state, but also serve the central work of the local area. Second, statistical work is both a tool for political and production struggles, so it must rely on the leadership of local Party committees at all levels, so as to fully play the role of statistical work and correct the tendency of being divorced from politics and divorced from reality. Third, under the leadership of the Party, implement the mass line, rely on the broad masses to do statistics, so that statistical data "reaches the heavens (Party and government leaders) and lands on the ground (the masses)," truly serving the production activities of the masses, so that it can obtain the strong support of the broad masses for statistical work.

The conference pointed out that the great leap forward in statistical work must first lead business politically. Statistical work must be closely combined with the political and production activities of the broad masses, closely grasp the progress of production, mobilize the masses to conduct evaluations, and promote the great leap forward in production; it is necessary to provide whatever statistical data the Party and government leaders need, and statistical work will follow wherever the political movement and production movement are carried out. Second, it is necessary to implement the mass line under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, mobilize the broad masses to participate in statistical work, and achieve statistics by the whole people. Statistical work cannot simply rely on statistical organs and full-time cadres, nor can it simply rely on top-down leadership, but must rely on Party committees at all levels and the broad masses.

Participating in this meeting were the directors of statistical bureaus from all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, and responsible cadres from statistical departments of some special districts, cities, and counties.

    结合现实斗争搞统计
    统计工作者决心依靠群众三个月改变工作面貌
    据新华社保定31日电　国家统计局最近召开全国省市统计工作保定现场会议，提出要在党的领导下，依靠地方，依靠群众，实现全民办统计，苦战三个月，彻底改变全国统计工作面貌。会议确定在全国范围内进一步推广河北省改革统计工作的经验，使统计工作与群众的政治运动、生产运动密切结合起来，充分发挥促进生产的作用。
    出席会议的代表听了河北省副省长胡开明和省内有关地区负责干部的报告，并到承德、邯郸等六个专区参观了近百个基层单位的统计工作。他们在这里看到：各级党政领导都很重视统计工作，许多党委书记、县长亲手抓统计工作；统计工作能够及时反映出生产进度，成为党政领导机关指挥生产的重要依据；广大群众经常运用统计资料评比生产，代表们一致认为，河北省为我国统计工作大跃进树立了旗帜。
    会议总结了河北省改革统计工作的经验。河北的经验主要有三点：一、要搞好统计工作，各级统计机关和统计干部，首先要明确认识统计工作的性质和任务。河北省是把统计工作作为服务于政治斗争和生产斗争的一种工具来使用的。这样，就使统计工作不是孤立地去搞定期的报表，而是与轰轰烈烈的现实斗争紧密结合，使它既能满足国家需要，也能为地方的中心工作服务。二、统计工作既是政治、生产斗争的工具，就必须依靠各级地方党委来领导，这样才能充分发挥统计工作的作用，纠正脱离政治、脱离实际的偏向。三、在党的领导下，贯彻执行群众路线，依靠广大群众办统计，使统计资料“上通天（党政领导）、下落地（群众）”，真正服务于群众的生产活动，这样也就能取得广大群众对统计工作的大力支持。
    会议指出，统计工作的大跃进，首先要政治领导业务。统计工作必须同广大群众的政治、生产活动密切结合，紧紧地掌握生产进度，发动群众进行评比，促进生产大跃进；要作到党政领导需要什么统计资料，就供给什么统计资料，政治运动和生产运动开展到那里，统计工作就跟到那里。其次，必须在各级党委的领导下，贯彻执行群众路线，发动广大群众参加统计工作，实现全民办统计。统计工作既不能单纯依靠统计机关和专职干部，也不能单纯依靠自上而下的领导，必须依靠各级党委和广大群众来办。
    参加这次会议的有全国各省、市、自治区的统计局长，部分专署、市、县统计部门的负责干部。
