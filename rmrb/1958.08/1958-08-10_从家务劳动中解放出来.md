Colum: Common Talk

　　A few days ago, I went to the suburbs. I sat at Li Ersao's house for half a day, and it was almost lunchtime, but I didn't see her cooking. I thought, maybe she forgot to cook because she was chatting. After a while, she asked me to eat, and I joked, "What are you going to feed me!" Li Ersao laughed when I said this. She told me all about the new "public canteen" in the countryside.

　　"Sister Yang, you don't know, our agricultural cooperative recently opened a public canteen. The members eat in the canteen after work. The food in the canteen is cheap and delicious, and it's very popular with everyone. Let's just talk about cooking. In the past, each family had a stove, and we women were busy cooking all day long and couldn't go out to work. Seeing that the work in the cooperative couldn't be finished, we wanted to go but didn't have the time. With the establishment of the canteen, we are liberated. Men and women work together to produce, which not only increases the labor force for the cooperative, but also increases our own income. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone? Also, with a canteen, everyone goes to eat when it's time to eat, and everyone goes to the fields when it's time to work. The action is fast, and no production time is wasted. The canteen also saves grain, saves firewood, and is clean and hygienic by cooking together. Some old, weak, orphaned, and lonely people no longer worry about not having someone to cook for them. It's really like a socialist big family!"

　　Li Ersao took me to the public canteen, where we enjoyed a comfortable meal of cold noodles.

　　It's really a new thing to run public canteens in the countryside. In addition, many streets in the city and some agricultural cooperatives in the countryside have also established nurseries, barber shops, sewing groups, mills, and so on. In this way, many women are no longer burdened by heavy household chores, and they can go to production when they want to, and participate in activities when they want to.

　　I heard that some sisters-in-law and elder sisters are not very convinced of these new things. First, they don't see its benefits, and second, they always feel unaccustomed. Li Ersao has already talked about the benefits. The issue of habit needs to be recognized from an ideological point of view. Perhaps we are used to the small family life of each household and are not accustomed to this kind of collective, cooperative approach. However, we cannot look at new things with old views, especially since this is a major event directly related to liberating women's labor force and bringing into play the important role of housewives in socialist construction!

### 从家务劳动中解放出来

    从家务劳动中解放出来
    前些天，我到郊区去。在李二嫂家里一坐半天，快到中午吃饭的时候了，总也不见她做饭。我想，大概拉起家常来，忘记做饭了。一会，她要我去吃饭，我开玩笑地说：“你让我去吃什么呀！”我这一说，李二嫂笑开了。她一口气向我介绍了农村办“公共食堂”的新鲜事儿。
      “杨大姐，你不知道哇，最近我们农业社里新办了一个公共食堂，社员们下了工都在食堂里吃饭。食堂的饭又便宜、又好吃，可受大伙欢迎啦。别的不说，就说这做饭吧，以前，一家一户一个灶，咱们妇女整天忙着做饭，不能出工生产，眼看着社里的活做不完，咱们想去做可又没有工夫去。成立食堂，咱们可解放啦。男的女的一起出工生产，给社里增加了劳动力不说，自己也增加了收入。这不是一举两得吗？还有，有了食堂，该吃饭的时候，大家都去吃，到了干活的时候，大家都下地，行动快，不浪费生产时间。食堂统一做饭还节约粮食、节约柴、清洁卫生。有些老、弱、孤、独的人再也不为没人做饭犯愁了。这真像个社会主义大家庭啊！”
    李二嫂带我到了公共食堂，我们在这里舒舒服服地吃了一顿凉面条。
    农村里办公共食堂，这真是件新鲜事。另外，城市里许多街道和有些农村的农业社，还成立了托儿所、理发室、缝纫组、磨坊等等。这样一来，许多妇女再也不受繁重的家务劳动的拖累，要下地生产就去生产；要参加活动就去参加了。
    听说，对这些新鲜事，有些大嫂、大姐们还不怎么信服。一是看不到它的好处，二是总觉得不大习惯。好处，李二嫂已经说了。习惯的问题需要从思想上去认识。也许我们过惯了一家一户的小家庭生活，对这种集体的、互助合作的作法不习惯。但是，我们不能用老看法来看新事物，更何况这是直接关系到解放妇女劳动力，发挥家庭妇女对社会主义建设的重大作用的大事呢！
