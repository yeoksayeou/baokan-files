Moving from High Yield to Higher Yield
By our reporter Tian Zhuang

The material recorded here is from Shenwan Township in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, one of the many high-yield townships that emerged during this summer's bumper harvest. From this material, people can see that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the broad masses of peasants have broken the superstition that wheat cannot achieve high yields and boldly innovated techniques in cultivation and planting, thus achieving large-scale, high-yield harvests. At the same time, a large number of facts vividly prove that the potential for wheat yield increase is not small, but very large.

"Condition Theory" Proponents, Please Look at the Facts

This township, which has 15,000 mu of wheat, achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year, becoming a "thousand-jin township" known throughout the province. But what was the situation here before? Even in last year's bumper harvest, the average yield per mu was only 247 jin. Of the 17 agricultural cooperatives in the township, most increased production at a rate of three to five times, except for a few whose increase was less than double. The production increase of the Victory No. 2 Cooperative was even more astonishing. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu of this cooperative was only 153 jin, but this year it jumped to 1,300 jin, an increase of more than seven times compared to last year. In addition, there are five agricultural cooperatives in the township with an average wheat yield of 1,300 jin to 1,500 jin per mu, and there are also eight production teams with yields exceeding 2,000 jin per mu. Moreover, breaking the high-yield record of 3,000 jin and 4,000 jin per mu is not an isolated phenomenon in Shenwan Township; some even reached more than 5,000 jin.

The reason why Shenwan Township was able to create such an amazing miracle is not because of particularly good natural conditions. No! From the terrain point of view, there are plains, hills, and mountains; from the soil point of view, there is both oily sandy soil described as "you can step on it and squeeze out oil," and yellow soil described as "flies won't even lay eggs in it." However, both in the mountainous, hilly, and plain areas, bumper harvests were obtained, and a large number of high-yield records emerged on various types of soil. Take the Happiness Cooperative as an example. Most of this cooperative is in a hilly area. Of the more than 950 mu of wheat land in the whole cooperative, only about 100 mu have better soil, and the rest are poor land that "flies won't even lay eggs in." However, the average wheat yield per mu in the whole cooperative reached 1,310 jin this year, an increase of more than three times compared to last year. "Planting wheat in cotton fields is like a beggar hosting a feast," is a saying that has been circulating here for who knows how many generations, meaning that it is difficult to achieve high yields when planting wheat in cotton fields. However, a young girl named Wang Xiuying from the Greening Cooperative achieved a yield of 3,977 jin per mu on 1.8 mu of sandy soil that had been planted with cotton.

The facts are so clear: although natural conditions have an impact on agricultural production, natural conditions are not unchangeable. However, the mistake of the "condition theory" proponents lies precisely here—they excessively emphasize the role of conditions while underestimating the subjective initiative of people. When the reporter investigated in Shenwan Township, he found many such facts: due to different subjective efforts, despite the same natural and geographical conditions, the yields varied greatly between them. For example, the aforementioned Happiness Cooperative and another cooperative in the township, the Advanced Cooperative, are next to each other, and whether it is the terrain or the soil, they are almost the same. But what about the yield of this cooperative? Only 370 jin, 930 jin less than the Happiness Cooperative. There are many such examples, too numerous to mention.

The Key Lies in Ideological Liberation

So, how did Shenwan Township achieve large-scale, high-yield wheat harvests, especially high-yield harvests on various types of soil? The key lies in breaking superstitions and liberating the mind. According to the investigation, all those with wheat yields of 1,000 jin or even 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu have made a series of innovations in cultivation and planting, and among them, they have firmly grasped the following measures: First, deep plowing and cross plowing. The depth of plowing generally reached more than seven inches, and most of them adopted the method of vertical and horizontal cross plowing. Many experimental plots with wheat yields of 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu had a cultivated layer of one chi to one chi two cun, and also achieved plowing followed by harrowing, vertical plowing and horizontal harrowing, and horizontal plowing and vertical harrowing; Second, applying base fertilizer layer by layer. All experimental plots with yields of more than 3,000 jin per mu have one thing in common: a particularly large amount of base fertilizer is applied. In terms of fertilization methods, base fertilizer is applied every time the land is plowed, so that the fertilizer is distributed deeply and evenly, allowing the wheat roots to penetrate deeply and widely, which can prevent lodging. Third, increasing the seeding rate. For experimental plots with yields of more than 3,000 jin per mu, the seeding rate was above 28 jin, with the highest reaching 36 jin. This greatly improved land utilization. Facts have proven that wheat fields with yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu have more than 300,000 seedlings; wheat fields with yields of more than 2,000 jin per mu have 600,000 seedlings; wheat fields with yields of more than 3,000 jin per mu have 1 million seedlings; and wheat fields with yields of more than 4,000 jin per mu have 1.2 million seedlings.

However, the above-mentioned effective measures for increasing production have not been widely promoted throughout the township. Even in a cooperative or a team, they have not been fully implemented. Take deep plowing as an example: the depth of plowing in large areas of the township is only five cun. In the Patriotic and Thousand Jin Cooperatives, it is even less than five cun. The Fengshan Cooperative, with an average yield of only 180 jin per mu, only plowed three cun deep in its more than 400 mu of wheat land. Some agricultural cooperatives have seeding rates of only 17 or 18 jin, or even less. In terms of fertilization, the township averages only 130 dan of fertilizer per mu, and the phenomenon of insufficient base fertilizer in some cooperatives is quite serious. Why is this happening? This shows that the conservative ideas of some people cannot be completely overcome all at once. Last year, before the winter sowing, in order to strive for a greater wheat harvest, the township's Party organization deeply and extensively mobilized the masses, and successively conducted debates on issues such as comparing the yield increase between dense planting and sparse planting, and comparing the yield increase between deep plowing and shallow plowing. As a result of repeated debates, some people with conservative ideas originally had their eyes opened, thereby breaking superstitions and boldly adopting advanced cultivation and planting techniques according to local conditions. However, there are still some people who doubt or even oppose various agricultural technology innovations. For example, at that time, many people did not believe that deep plowing could increase production. They said, "Plowing too deep will not grow wheat." The same is true for dense planting, thinking that wheat grows densely, not planted densely, and suspecting that planting too densely will not grow wheat ears. There were even incidents of weeding out wheat seedlings, making dense sparse. It can be seen from this that, in order to innovate cultivation techniques, the key lies in breaking superstitions and liberating the mind.

Has Production Reached Its Limit?

Some skeptics and condition-only theorists who hold viewpoints such as "agricultural production can only increase slowly" and "leaps forward are impossible when natural conditions are poor," cannot help but admit defeat in the face of ironclad facts and cannot help but admit the truth that "man can conquer nature, and success depends on human effort." However, many of them have developed such doubts again: Can wheat continue to make a big leap forward next year? In their opinion, wheat has already had a bumper harvest, the land's fertility has been exhausted, and it will be difficult to make another leap forward next year. This argument is obviously unfounded.

Although Shenwan Township has achieved large-scale bumper harvests, the phenomenon of uneven harvests is very prominent. Of the 15,000 mu of wheat in the township, the highest average yield per mu reached 4,000 to 5,000 jin, generally around 1,000 jin, and there are still many wheat fields with less than 500 jin, or even only 100 or 200 jin. This imbalance also exists widely from the perspective of cooperatives and teams. Even those cooperatives and teams that seem to have very high yields still have many "loopholes" in production, and the potential for increasing production is still great. Now, let's take a look at the yield situation of each team in the Lemin Cooperative, which has the highest yield per unit area in the township:

First Production Team: 107 mu, average yield of 1,295 jin per mu
Second Production Team: 129 mu, average yield of 1,210 jin per mu
Third Production Team: 143 mu, average yield of 2,000 jin per mu
Fourth Production Team: 119.5 mu, average yield of 2,401 jin per mu
Fifth Production Team: 105 mu, average yield of 2,000 jin per mu
Sixth Production Team: 113 mu, average yield of 1,503 jin per mu
Seventh Production Team: 93.8 mu, average yield of 637 jin per mu

It is not difficult to see that the potential for increasing wheat production in this cooperative is still very large. According to preliminary inspection, although this cooperative has done well in terms of deep plowing, dense planting, fertilization, and field management, there are still some shortcomings. For example, the conditions of the Second Production Team and the Third Production Team are almost the same, but the yields between them vary greatly. What is the reason? After an inspection, it was discovered that the reason why the yield of the Second Production Team was lower than that of the Third Production Team was that the deep plowing was not done well, with an average depth of only six cun, while the plowing depth of the Third Production Team reached more than seven cun. There are many similar examples. Even in some high-yield mu with yields of more than 4,000 or 5,000 jin, the results of summary and inspection prove that the potential of the land is still very large. For example, the high-yield record of 4,689 jin per mu created by Xu Daoqing of the Pioneer Cooperative on 1.7788 mu, after inspection and summary, found that this land still had problems in terms of deep plowing to preserve moisture, dense planting, and prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests. Even agricultural scientists unanimously believe that if these aspects were done better, the yield of this land would not be more than 4,000 jin, but would increase even more.

Striving for Higher Production and Another Leap Forward

The broad masses of cadres and peasants in Shenwan Township, which achieved high-yield wheat harvests, have received an extremely profound education in the face of these vivid facts. In particular, those with serious conservative ideas have taken the initiative to examine their conservative ideas after seeing the high yield of wheat with their own eyes. Those who were most unconvinced of yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, dense planting, and applying sufficient base fertilizer in the past have now changed their views, and some are planning to plant experimental fields, preparing to compete with Liu Shunkuan, Xu Daoqing, Wang Mingjin and others, who created high-yield records, next year.

In order to strive for higher wheat production and another leap forward next year, the broad masses of peasants in this township, under the leadership of the Party organization, are summarizing the experience of increasing production, tapping the potential for increasing production, and deciding to further take measures to overcome the "loopholes" in production, so as to create conditions for a greater wheat harvest next year. According to the preliminary production increase measures proposed by each cooperative: First, universally promote deep plowing and cross plowing. The plowing depth in plain cooperatives should reach one chi to one chi two cun; the plowing depth in hilly and mountainous cooperatives should reach six cun to nine cun. At the same time, according to the different soil types of the cultivated land, add sand, add mud, and add miscellaneous soil fertilizer respectively, so as to thoroughly improve the soil and turn more than 5,000 mu of barren and poor land in the township into fertile land. Second, it is decided that the average fertilization rate per mu will be increased from 130 dan last year to 500 dan, and the method of applying fertilizer layer by layer will be universally promoted. In addition, it is also required to apply 500 dan of topdressing fertilizer in stages according to the growth status of the wheat. Third, in order to ensure more than 600,000 wheat plants per mu on average, it is decided to increase the seeding rate to 30 jin. Fourth, do a good job in field cultivation management, and actively prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests. To this end, the township has decided to expand the wheat area to 20,000 mu, with an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu. The planned output of eight cooperatives including Happiness is even higher, with an average yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu. The Lemin Cooperative is also preparing to cultivate 10,000 jin per mu in a 100-mu wheat experimental field, striving to reach a record of 15,000 jin.

At present, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for building socialism, the peasants of this township are full of energy and confidence, and are advancing towards a new peak in wheat production.

    从高产走向更高产
    本报记者  田庄
    这里记述的材料，是湖北省今年夏季丰收涌现出无数高额丰产乡中的一个——谷城县沈湾乡的小麦丰产情况。从这个材料里，人们不仅能够看出广大农民在共产党的领导下，由于破除了小麦不能高产的迷信，大胆地从耕作、栽培等方面革新技术，因而取得了大面积高额丰产；同时，大量的事实还生动地证明了小麦的增产潜力，不是小得很而是大得很。
    “条件论”者请看事实
    这个拥有一万五千亩小麦的乡，今年平均亩产达到了一千斤，一跃成为闻名全省的“千斤乡”了。而在这以前，这里的情况怎样呢？就以大丰收的去年来说，平均亩产只有二百四十七斤。全乡十七个农业社，除个别社增产幅度不到一倍以外，大部分都是以三倍到五倍的速度增产的。其中胜利二社的增产情况更加惊人。去年，这个社的小麦平均亩产还只有一百五十三斤，而今年就一下子跃增到一千三百斤，比去年增产了七倍多。此外，全乡平均亩产小麦一千三百斤到一千五百斤的农业社有五个，还出现了八个亩产二千斤以上的生产队。而且，单位面积产量突破三千斤、四千斤大关的高产纪录，在沈湾乡也并不是个别现象，甚至有的达到了五千斤以上。
    沈湾乡所以能够创造这样惊人的奇迹，是不是因为自然条件特殊的好呢？不是的！从地形看，这里有平原，有丘陵，也有山区；从土质看，既有被形容为“一脚能踩出油来的油沙地，也有被形容为“屙屎不长蛆”的黄土地。但是，无论是在山区、丘陵区还是平原区，都获得了丰产，并且在各种各样的土质的土地上，涌现了大批高额丰产纪录。就拿幸福社来说吧，这个社绝大部分是丘陵地区，全社九百五十多亩小麦地，其中只有一百来亩土质较好，其余都是“屙屎不长蛆”的孬地。但是，全社今年平均亩产小麦却达到一千三百一十斤，比去年增产了三倍多。“棉花地种麦，如同叫花子请客”，是这里流传了不知多少年代的一种说法，意思是说，在棉地里种麦子，要想高产是困难的。可是，绿化社有个叫王秀英的年青姑娘，在一亩八分种过棉花的飞沙地里，亩产达到了三千九百七十七斤。
    事实是这样清楚：自然条件虽然对农业生产有影响，但是，自然条件并不是不可改变的。然而“条件论”者的错误，恰恰就在这里——他们过分强调了条件的作用，而低估了人的主观能动作用。记者在沈湾乡调查的时候，就发现了不少这样的事实：由于人为的主观努力不同，尽管自然条件、地理条件一样，但它们之间的产量却悬殊很大。例如，前面提到的幸福社与这个乡的另一个社——先进社，紧紧相挨，无论是地形也好，土质也好，都几乎相同，可是，这个社的产量怎样呢？只有三百七十斤，比幸福社少九百三十斤。这类例子还很多，举不胜举。
    关键在于思想解放
    那么，沈湾乡小麦大面积高额丰产，特别是各种不同土质的高额丰产，是怎样取得的呢？关键在于破除迷信，思想解放。根据调查，凡亩产小麦千斤以至三、四千斤的，都在耕作、栽培等方面作了一系列的革新，而其中又紧紧地抓住了以下几手：第一，深耕和交叉犁。耕地深度一般地达到七寸以上，而且大都采取了纵横交叉犁的方法。许多亩产小麦四千到五千斤的试验地，耕层更达到了一尺到一尺二寸，还做到了随犁随耙，直犁横耙，横犁直耙；第二，层层施底肥。凡亩产三千斤以上的试验地，都有这样一个共同特点，底肥下得特别多，在施肥方法上，采取每犁一次就下一次底肥，这样，肥料就分布得深而匀，使麦根扎得深，扎得广，可以防止倒伏。第三，增加播种量。凡亩产三千斤以上的试验地，播种量都在二十八斤以上，其中最多的达到了三十六斤。这就大大提高了土地利用率。事实证明：亩产千斤以上的麦田，麦苗都在三十万株以上；亩产两千斤以上的麦田，麦苗有六十万株以上；亩产三千斤以上的麦田，麦苗有一百万株以上；亩产四千斤以上的麦田，麦苗有一百二十万株以上。
    但是，上述各项对增产行之有效的措施，并没有在全乡范围内普遍推广。即使在一社一队也没有得到全面贯彻。就拿深耕来说，全乡大面积的耕地深度只有五寸。爱国、千斤等社还不到五寸；平均亩产只有一百八十斤的封山社，全社四百多亩麦地只犁了三寸深。有些农业社播种量只有十七、八斤，甚至更少。在施肥方面，全乡平均每亩只有一百三十担肥料，有些社底肥不足的现象相当严重。为什么会发生这种情况呢？这说明有些人的保守思想不是一下子就能完全克服的。去年，还在冬播以前，为了争取小麦更大丰收，这个乡的党组织曾经深入、广泛地发动群众，先后几次进行了密植与稀植增产对比、深耕与浅耕增产对比等问题的辩论。经过反复辩论的结果，原来一些有保守思想的人，大开眼界，从而破除了迷信，大胆地因地制宜地采取了先进的耕作、栽培技术。但是，还有些人怀疑甚至反对各种农业技术革新。例如，当时就有不少人不相信深耕能够增产。他们说：“犁深了不长麦子”。对密植也是如此，认为麦子是长密的，不是种密的，怀疑种密了不长麦穗。甚至还发生了锄掉麦苗，使密变稀的事情。由此可见，要想革新耕作技术，关键在于破除迷信，解放思想。
    增产到顶了没有
    一些持有“农业增产只能缓进”“自然条件差不能跃进”等观点的怀疑论者和唯条件论者，在铁的事实面前不能不服输了，不能不承认“人定胜天，事在人为”这个真理。但是，他们仍有不少人又发生了这样的怀疑：明年小麦能不能继续大跃进呢？在他们看来，小麦已经大丰收了，地力用尽了，明年再大跃进就困难了。这种论调显然是没有根据的。
    沈湾乡虽然取得了大面积丰产，但丰产不平衡的现象却十分突出。全乡一万五千亩小麦，其中产量最高的平均亩产达到四、五千斤，一般地在千斤左右，还有不少麦田不到五百斤，甚至只有一、二百斤。这种不平衡的现象，从社、队来看也普遍存在，即使那些看来产量已经很高的社、队，生产上的“漏洞”还有很多，增产潜力还是很大。现在，我们来看看全乡单位面积产量最高的乐民社各队的产量情况：
    第一生产队一百零七亩平均亩产一千二百九十五斤
    第二生产队一百二十九亩平均亩产一千二百一十斤
    第三生产队一百四十三亩平均亩产二千斤
    第四生产队一百一十九点五亩平均亩产二千四百零一斤
    第五生产队一百零五亩平均亩产二千斤
    第六生产队一百一十三亩平均亩产一千五百零三斤
    第七生产队九十三点八亩平均亩产六百三十七斤
    不难看出，这个社的小麦增产潜力还很大。根据初步检查，这个社虽然在深耕、密植、施肥以及田间管理等方面都做得较好，但仍还存在着一些缺点。例如，第二生产队和第三生产队，各方面的条件几乎一样，然而它们之间的产量却悬殊很大。原因何在呢？后来一检查，才发现第二生产队产量所以低于第三生产队，是由于深耕这一关没抓好，平均深度只有六寸，而第三生产队耕地深度达到七寸以上。类似这样的例子还有很多。即使有些亩产四、五千斤以上高产亩，经过总结、检查的结果证明，土地的潜力仍然大得很。例如，先锋社徐道清在一点七七八八亩创造的亩产四千六百八十九斤的高产纪录，经过检查、总结，发现这块地在深耕保墒、密植以及防治作物病虫害等方面，都还存在着毛病。连农业科学家在内都一致认为：如这些方面做得更好些，这块地的产量不是四千多斤而是跃增得更多些。
    力争再高产再跃进
    获得小麦高额丰产的沈湾乡的广大干部和农民，在这些活生生的事实面前，受到了一次极为深刻的教育。特别是那些有着严重保守思想的人，亲眼看到小麦高产以后，纷纷主动地对自己的保守思想作了检查。过去对深耕、密植和施足底肥等增产措施最不通的人，现在都改变了自己的看法，有的正盘算着种试验田，准备明年与创造高产纪录的刘顺宽、徐道清、王明进等人比个高低。
    为了争取明年小麦再高产再跃进，这个乡的广大农民，正在党组织的领导下，总结增产经验，挖掘增产潜力，决定进一步采取措施，克服生产上的“漏洞”，以便为明年小麦更大丰收创造条件。根据各社初步提出的增产措施是：一、普遍推广深耕和交叉犁。平原社耕地深度达到一尺到一尺二寸；丘陵和山区社六寸到九寸。同时，按照耕地不同土质，分别加沙、加泥、加土杂肥，做到彻底改良土壤，把全乡五千多亩瘦田瘠地变为肥田。二、决定每亩平均施肥量由去年的一百三十担，增加到五百担，并且普遍推广层层施肥的方法。另外，还要求根据麦子生长状况，看苗分期追肥五百担。三、为了保证平均每亩小麦六十万株以上，决定播种量增加到三十斤。四、做好田间培育管理，积极防治作物病虫害。为此，全乡决定把小麦面积扩大到两万亩，平均亩产达到二千斤。其中幸福等八个社的计划产量更高，平均亩产达到三千斤以上，乐民社还准备在一百亩小麦试验地里，培育亩产一万斤，争取达到一万五千斤的纪录。
    目前，这个乡的农民在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，干劲十足，信心百倍地正向小麦产量更新的高峰迈进。
