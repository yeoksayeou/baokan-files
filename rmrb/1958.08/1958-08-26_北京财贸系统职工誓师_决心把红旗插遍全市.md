　　Beijing Financial and Trade System Workers Vow
    To Plant Red Flags All Over the City

    (Our dispatch) After having a "Tianqiao Department Store"-style red flag, the Beijing financial and trade work departments have now entered a new stage of great leap forward. At yesterday's Beijing Financial and Trade System Competition and Leap Forward Swearing-in Conference, more than 40,000 employees unanimously stated that they would work hard for a month to plant red flags throughout the capital's financial and trade system; create red flag streets and red flag townships, so that the red flags would be linked together.
    At the conference, twenty-eight advanced units were awarded red flags. The award-winning units were the vanguards of the leap forward in commerce, service industry, finance, taxation, and banking. Among them were the Shang'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Mentougou District, which went to the mountains and countryside to serve agricultural production, and the Tianqiao Vegetable Station, which actively supported vegetable production in the suburbs.
    The conference was held in Tiantan Park. After Wan Li, Wu Han, Cheng Hongyi, and Le Songsheng, the deputy mayors of Beijing, awarded the red flags to the twenty-eight advanced units on behalf of the Municipal People's Committee, Zhang Jibin, the chairman of the trade union of Tianqiao Department Store, spoke on behalf of the award-winning red flag units, expressing that they would raise the red flag higher and higher and fully support industrial and agricultural production.
    Wan Li, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Cheng Hongyi, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, spoke at the meeting successively. They pointed out that although the city's financial and trade departments had made great achievements in the past six months, they had not yet reached the level that socialist commercial work should have. Therefore, they should work hard for a month and launch a large-scale competition between streets and districts to establish more red flag streets and red flag districts, so that the movement can be developed more comprehensively, deeply, and universally. They also pointed out that the commercial departments should expand the purchase and sales plan according to the new leap forward plans of industry and agriculture and capital construction, and actively help industrial and capital construction units overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials; and actively reflect consumers' opinions to the industrial departments to produce products that are more suitable for the needs of the masses.

　　北京财贸系统职工誓师
    决心把红旗插遍全市
    本报讯　北京财贸工作部门在有了“天桥百货商场”式的红旗以后，现在又进入一个新的大跃进阶段。在昨天举行的北京市财贸系统评比跃进誓师大会上，四万多名职工一致表示要苦战一个月，把红旗插遍首都财贸系统；创造红旗街、红旗乡，使红旗联成一片。
    在大会上，有二十八个先进单位得到红旗。受奖单位有商业、服务业、财政、税收和银行等方面跃进的尖兵。其中有上山下乡为农业生产服务的门头沟区上岸供销合作社，积极支援郊区蔬菜生产的天桥菜站等。
    大会在天坛公园举行。由北京市副市长万里、吴晗、程宏毅、乐松生代表市人民委员会授给这二十八个先进单位红旗后，天桥百货商场工会主席张继斌代表受奖的红旗单位发言，表示要把红旗越举越高，全力支援工农业生产。
    中共北京市委书记处书记、北京市副市长万里和中共北京市委常委、北京市副市长程宏毅先后在会上讲了话。他们指出全市财贸部门在过去半年中，虽然取得很大成绩，但还没有达到社会主义商业工作所应有的水平。因此应苦战一个月，展开街与街、区与区之间的大竞赛，树立起更多的红旗街、红旗区，使运动展开得更全面更深入更普遍。他们还指出：商业部门要根据工农业、基本建设新的跃进计划，扩大购销计划，积极帮助工业、基本建设单位克服原材料不足的困难；主动地向工业部门反映消费者的意见，生产更适合群众需要的产品。
