Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th: The Taiqian Agricultural Commune in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, released a "satellite" on the 27th, reporting a millet yield of 21,787 jin per mu.

The high-yield millet field of the Taiqian Commune was carefully cultivated jointly by all comrades of the Shouzhang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the commune's cadres, and all members of the First Production Team, covering an area of 2.1 mu. More than 40 people participated in harvesting, checking the stalks, counting the ears, threshing, weighing, and measuring the land, including Xia Zhengong, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Liu Chuanyou, First Secretary of the Shouzhang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Jiasheng, Deputy Secretary.

That afternoon, after threshing and weighing, the total output was calculated to be 45,753 jin and 12 liang, equivalent to 21,787 jin and 8 liang per mu.

This newspaper reports: The 2 mu spring corn experimental field cultivated by the Dengta-Nanguan Commune of Pucheng Township in Fan County achieved a high yield of 11,281.5 jin per mu on average. This experimental field was jointly established by the county committee's grassroots work team and the township and commune committees. Due to the adoption of measures such as deep plowing, multiple applications of fertilizer in stages, watering, pest control, and artificial pollination, the corn grew vigorously, with thick stalks and large ears. The stalks generally reached a height of nine chi, with each mu producing 15,046 ears of corn.
