Shanghai and Chongqing Youth Launch a Great Leap Forward into the Labor and Defense System

(By Our Correspondent) Shanghai's youth, after criticizing the mystical idea that "the Labor and Defense System is unattainable," have been diligently and persistently engaging in training, resulting in a significant leap forward in the pass rate of the Labor and Defense System. According to statistics, 20,315 people in the city reached the Labor and Defense System standard last year. In the first half of this year alone, more than 40,000 people in the city have passed various levels of the Labor and Defense System standard.

After 48 days of strenuous training, 28 out of 29 students in Class 3 of the fourth grade at the East China University of Political Science and Law passed the Labor and Defense System. In June, students at the Tongji University Accelerated Middle School organized more than 1,000 Labor and Defense System single-item competitions and various contests. Through intensive efforts, hard work, and focused assistance, more than 87% of the students in the school have passed various levels of the Labor and Defense System.

In addition to schools, the Labor and Defense System pass rates for young people in many factories and government offices in Shanghai have also greatly increased. Before April this year, not a single person in Yulin District had passed the Labor and Defense System. However, in the one and a half months from May to mid-June, 1,263 people passed various levels of the Labor and Defense System standard. In the first half of the year, more than 6,000 people in Hongkou District reached the Labor and Defense System standard.

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) More than 10,000 college students in Chongqing have engaged in Labor and Defense System training activities.

This year, the breadth and regularity of Chongqing's college students' participation in Labor and Defense System training have increased compared to previous years. Chongqing University, Southwest Normal College, Southwest University of Political Science and Law, Chongqing Normal College, and other schools have all their students, except those with illnesses, participating in Labor and Defense System training, whereas in the past, the highest participation rate was generally only 80%. Students maintain training for ten to thirty minutes every morning. In the past month or two, Chongqing University and Southwest University of Political Science and Law have held single-item Labor and Defense System competitions and tests every morning and evening. More than 1,400 of the more than 3,000 students at Chongqing University have reached the Labor and Defense System standard. 50% of the students at Southwest Normal College have reached the Labor and Defense System standard. This year, more than 200 students at Southwest University of Political Science and Law reached the Labor and Defense System standard, which is equivalent to the number of people at the school who reached the Labor and Defense System standard throughout last year.

Due to the persistence of Labor and Defense System training, students' sports performance has improved rapidly. Before May, Chongqing University only had more than ten graded athletes, but now the number has suddenly increased to more than two hundred. Southwest Normal College did not have any graded athletes in this area in the past, but now 270 people have reached the standard of graded athletes.

　　破除神秘观点后出现新气象
　　上海重庆青年向劳卫制大进军
    本报讯　上海广大青年批判了“劳卫制高不可攀”的神秘思想，认真、顽强地进行锻炼，劳卫制及格率大大跃进。据统计，去年一年全市有两万零三百十五人达到劳卫制标准，今年上半年，全市就已有四万多人通过了劳卫制各级标准。
    华东政法学院四年级三班的二十九个同学经过四十八天的刻苦锻炼，全班有二十八人通过了劳卫制。同济大学速成中学的学生在6月份里组织了劳卫制单项比赛和各种竞赛一千次以上，经过突击、苦战、重点帮助，全校已有87％以上的学生通过劳卫制各级标准。
    除去学校外，上海许多工厂、机关的青年，劳卫制及格率也大大跃进了。榆林区在今年4月以前，没有一个人通过劳卫制，而在5月到6月中的一个半月里，就有一千二百六十三人通过劳卫制各级标准。虹口区上半年已有六千人以上达到了劳卫制标准。

    据新华社讯　重庆市一万多大学生投入了劳卫制锻炼活动。
    今年，重庆市各高等学校学生参加劳卫制锻炼的广泛性和经常性都比往年高。重庆大学、西南师范学院、西南政法学院、重庆师范专科学校等校，除有病的学生以外，全部学生都参加了劳卫制锻炼，而过去一般学校最高也只有80％的学生参加。学生们每天早晨坚持锻炼十到三十分钟。重庆大学、西南政法学院最近一两个月来，天天早晨和晚上都有劳卫制规定的运动项目单项比赛和测验。重庆大学三千多学生中已有一千四百多人达到了劳卫制标准。西南师范学院达到劳卫制标准的学生已达到50％。西南政法学院今年有二百多人达到劳卫制标准，这个数目相当于去年这个学校全年达到劳卫制标准的人数。
    学生们由于坚持劳卫制锻炼，体育运动成绩提高得很快。重庆大学5月份以前只有十多个等级运动员，现在一下子就增加到二百多个。西南师范学院过去根本没有这个项目的等级运动员，现在就有二百七十人达到了等级运动员的标准。
