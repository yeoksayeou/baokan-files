Chongqing Trolleybus Runs All Night

    (According to the Chongqing Daily) Chongqing's trolleybus line from Shangqingsi to Guojielou has recently begun operating all night.

    During the Great Leap Forward, the employees of the Chongqing Public Transportation Company, considering that the shops in the downtown area are open all night, people who want to buy things late at night have to travel a long way; many passengers taking ships often have to board at four or five in the morning; and some workers in factories and enterprises work night shifts and feel very inconvenient without transportation to and from work. Therefore, it was decided to implement overnight service on the Shangqingsi to Guojielou line. This trolleybus runs every twenty minutes at night. This improvement has greatly facilitated the masses and has been universally praised.

　　重庆电车通宵行驶
    据重庆日报报道　重庆市从上清寺到过街楼的无轨电车，最近开始每晚通宵行驶。
    重庆市公共交通公司的职工在大跃进中，考虑到市中区的商店都通宵营业，人们深夜想购买东西，要跑很多路；许多乘轮船的旅客，往往要在深夜四、五点上船；有些工厂企业的职工做夜班，上下班没有交通工具深感不方便。因此，决定在上清寺至过街楼这条线路上实行通宵行驶。这路电车在夜间每隔二十分钟开一班。这一改进，大大便利了群众，受到了普遍的赞扬。
