How Fiberglass is Made

We have already introduced the uses of fiberglass (see our newspaper on August 8th), and now we will talk about the manufacturing method of fiberglass.

The manufacturing technology of fiberglass is not very complicated.

The main materials for manufacturing fiberglass are glass fiber and plastic, of which glass fiber accounts for about 60% to 70%. Although glass is easily broken, it is very soft and smooth when drawn into filaments finer than hair, and can be woven into cloth that is as shiny as satin. The tensile strength of glass fiber is much stronger than all natural fibers such as cotton, linen, wool, and silk, and four times stronger than the commonly considered strongest organic synthetic fiber, "nylon." A bundle of glass fiber as thick as chopsticks can lift 14,000 jin, equivalent to the weight of one hundred adults. When manufacturing fiberglass, glass cloth can be used, but the most commonly used are thin mats made of glass fiber or chopped glass fiber.

Plastic is used for bonding. There are also many kinds of plastics, and phenolic resin and polyester resin are more commonly used. In addition, there are epoxy resin, melamine and silicone resin, etc. Each resin has its own characteristics. Phenolic resin has good heat resistance, high acid resistance, is not easy to catch fire, and can self-extinguish when burning, and is cheap; the disadvantage is that the color is dark and cannot be colored, and it generally requires relatively large pressure and temperature when manufacturing fiberglass. One of the two fiberglass boats that have recently been launched in our country, a speedboat, was made of phenolic resin. If the contact agent used is changed, the phenolic resin can also be polymerized and hardened at normal temperature without adding pressure. For example, recently, Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory used this method to make a yacht that is eight meters long, two meters wide, and can carry twenty people. The trial voyage results were very good.

The characteristic of polyester resin is that it can be polymerized and hardened without adding pressure, the color is light and transparent, and it can be colored in various colors. The disadvantage is that the heat resistance is poor, and it shrinks during molding, so the surface cannot be smooth, and the price is slightly more expensive. The fiberglass lifeboat in Beihai Park is made of polyester resin.

What kind of resin is used to manufacture fiberglass depends on the needs of the product and the manufacturing method. There are many manufacturing methods, which can be roughly divided into two categories: molding and pressing. Molding is to first make a model of the shape of the product with wood, cement and plaster, and then lay layers of resin-impregnated glass fiber on the model, and use a roller to remove the air bubbles. After it solidifies and is demolded, it becomes a whole shell that is the same as the model. This method is not convenient for applying pressure, so resins that can polymerize and harden under low pressure must be used. The characteristic of the molding method is that products with large volumes and complex shapes can be made into a whole piece without the need for splicing and processing, which is both beautiful and strong. Generally, fiberglass is used to manufacture car shells, boat shells and other complex-shaped products, mostly using this method, which occupies a very important position in fiberglass manufacturing.

The pressing method is divided into many types. When manufacturing simple shaped materials such as plates, etc., just layer the resin-impregnated glass fiber layer by layer and apply pressure under a press. After the shaped material is made, it is then mechanically processed. The speedboat launched in Beihai this time was riveted together with thin plates one and a half millimeters thick. If the pressing method is used to make things with special shapes, then the glass fiber can be pre-shaped into the required shape before adding resin and pressure. The forming method is generally to blow the short glass fibers cut into two-inch lengths with wind. There are many holes in the model, and the wind is drawn out from below. The blown short fibers are sucked onto the model, and then a small amount of binder is added to become a glass fiber blank. The blank is immersed in resin and then pressurized to become a fiberglass product.

### 玻璃钢是怎样制成的

　　玻璃钢是怎样制成的
    玻璃钢的用途我们已经介绍过了（见8月8日本报），现在谈一谈玻璃钢的制造方法。
    玻璃钢的制造技术是不太复杂的。
    制造玻璃钢的主要材料是玻璃丝和塑料，其中玻璃丝约占60％到70％。玻璃虽然很容易碰碎，但拉成比头发还要细的丝以后，非常柔软光滑，可以织成比缎子还光亮的布。玻璃丝的拉力强度比所有的天然纤维像棉、麻、羊毛、蚕丝等都要坚固得多，比一般认为最结实的有机合成纤维“尼龙”还要强上四倍。一束像筷子一般粗的玻璃丝可以吊起一万四千斤，相当于一百个成年人的重量。制造玻璃钢的时候，可以用玻璃布，但最常用的是玻璃丝做成的薄毡或切短的玻璃丝。
    塑料是用来做粘结用的。塑料也有很多种，用得比较多的是酚醛树脂、聚酯树脂，此外还有环氧树脂、三聚氰胺和矽树脂等。每种树脂都有它的特点。酚醛树脂耐热性较好，耐酸性很高，不容易着火，在燃烧时能够自己熄灭，价格便宜；缺点是颜色深，不能着色，在制造玻璃钢时一般需要比较大的压力和温度。我国最近制成下水的两只玻璃钢船中的一只快艇就是用酚醛树脂制造的。如果改变使用的接触剂，也可以使酚醛树脂在平常温度下，不用加压力就聚合变硬。例如，最近秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂用这种方法制成了一只长八公尺、宽二公尺、可以乘坐二十人的游艇，试航的结果很好。
    聚酯树脂的特点就是可以在不加压力的情况下聚合变硬，颜色浅、透明，可以着成各种颜色，缺点是耐热性较差，塑制时要收缩，因而表面不能光洁，价格也稍贵一点。在北海公园的玻璃钢救生艇就是用聚酯树脂制造的。
    制造玻璃钢采用什么树脂，要根据制品的需要和制造的方法来决定。制造的方法很多，大致可以分为塑制和压制两大类。塑制是先按照制品的外形用木材、水泥和石膏做成模型，把浸好树脂的玻璃丝一层层铺在模型上，用辊子把其中的气泡打出来，等到凝固以后脱模，就成为和模型一样的一个整个外壳。用这种方法不便于加压力，因此要采用在低压的情况下能够聚合变硬的树脂。塑制法的特点是可以把体积很大、外形很复杂的制品做成整个的一块，不需要再拼接加工，既美观又坚固。一般用玻璃钢制造汽车外壳、船壳和其他形状复杂的制品，大多是用这种方法，它在玻璃钢制造上占着很重要的位置。
    压制的方法又分为很多种。制造形状简单的型材如板材等的时候，只要把浸好树脂的玻璃丝一层层叠好，在压力机下加压就成。做成型材以后再进行机械加工。这次在北海下水的快艇就是用一公厘半厚的薄板铆接起来的。要是用压制法制做形状特殊的东西，那就可以先把玻璃丝预先成型做成需要的形状，再加树脂加压。成型的方法一般是把切成二寸长的短玻璃丝用风吹散，在模型上有很多孔，下面抽风，吹散的短丝就被吸在模型上，然后加少量的粘结剂就成为一个玻璃丝做成的毛胚，毛胚浸上树脂再加压就成为玻璃钢制品。
