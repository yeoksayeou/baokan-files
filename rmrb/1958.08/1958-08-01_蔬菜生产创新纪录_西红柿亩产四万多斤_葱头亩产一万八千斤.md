Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The spring and summer vegetable production in the suburbs of the capital has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to statistics, the planting area reached more than 180,000 mu, an increase of more than 30,000 mu compared with the same period last year, and the total output reached about 800 million jin, an increase of more than 130 million jin compared with last year, which not only guaranteed the supply of vegetables in the capital, but also supported cities in the Northeast and Northwest.

This summer's vegetable production has seen many high-yield records. The production of tomatoes, onions, and other vegetables has also broken the national record of last year. The two mu of high-yield small-trellis tomatoes in the Hongqi Cooperative in Fengtai District averaged 43,939 jin per mu. The 1.36 mu of high-yield land in the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District averaged 41,030 jin per mu, both exceeding the national record of 15,909 jin per mu of small-trellis tomatoes set by the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District last year. The 1.08 mu of high-yield onion land in the Dongtiejiangying Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District yielded more than 18,430 jin per mu, which also far exceeded the national record of 10,426 jin per mu of onions set by the Hongqi Cooperative in Fengtai District, a suburb of Beijing, last year.

This year's vegetable production in the suburbs of the capital was achieved by farmers overcoming drought. The main measures for high yields are deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization. For example, the Hongqi Cooperative left 12,600 seedlings per mu of tomatoes, more than twice the usual amount. The Dongtiejiangying Agricultural Cooperative planted 35,400 onion seedlings per mu, 13,000 to 17,000 more than usual. Onions have tubular leaves and a small spread, making them very suitable for close planting.

Also, the Nangguan Third Production Team of the Weixing Agricultural Cooperative in Changping Town, a suburb of Beijing, created a high-yield record of 20,140 jin per mu of cucumbers planted on 1.24 mu, which is 67.8% more than the highest cucumber yield per mu of 12,000 jin in the suburbs in the past. This high-yield field was jointly tested by Liu Zhentong, secretary of the town's Communist Youth League Committee, Kou Xin, youth production team leader, and Zhao Shouyong, an old commune member. They used the local Daqingci improved variety. Before planting, they dug the land to a depth of 1.2 chi, applied 15,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu (including 60 jin of superphosphate), planted 4,000 seedlings per mu at close spacing, applied 2,500 jin of manure as top dressing, and watered manure six times. To prevent powdery mildew and runaway blight, they sprayed lime-sulfur mixture three times and Bordeaux mixture twice. The cucumbers grew densely and large, generally more than two chi long and more than two jin in weight, with the largest being three chi long and more than four jin in weight.

    蔬菜生产创新纪录
    西红柿亩产四万多斤　葱头亩产一万八千斤
    新华社30日讯　首都郊区的春夏蔬菜生产获得了空前大丰收。据统计：种植面积达十八万多亩，比去年同期增加了三万多亩，总产量约达八亿斤，比去年增产一亿三千多万斤，不仅保证了首都蔬菜的供应，还支援了东北、西北等地的城市。
    今年夏季的蔬菜生产出现了不少高额丰产纪录，西红柿、葱头等蔬菜生产，还打破了去年全国的最高纪录。丰台区红旗社的二亩丰产小架西红柿，平均亩产四万三千九百三十九斤。丰台区黎明农业社的一点三六亩丰产地，平均亩产四万一千零三十斤，这都超过了去年丰台区黎明农业社亩产一万五千九百零九斤小架西红柿的全国最高纪录。丰台区东铁匠营农业社的一点零八亩葱头丰产地，亩产一万八千四百三十多斤，也远远超过了去年京郊丰台区红旗社亩产一万零四百二十六斤葱头的全国最高纪录。
    今年首都郊区的蔬菜生产是在农民战胜干旱下取得的。高额丰产的主要措施是深耕、密植、多施肥。如红旗社的西红柿每亩留苗一万二千六百棵，比一般的多留苗两倍以上。东铁匠营农业社的葱头每亩栽苗三万五千四百棵，比一般的多栽一万三千到一万七千多棵，葱头是管状叶，开展度小，很适宜密植。
    又讯　北京郊区昌平镇卫星农业社南关第三生产队种植的一亩二分四厘黄瓜，创造了亩产二万零一百四十斤的高产纪录，比郊区过去最高的黄瓜亩产量一万二千斤多67.8％。这块丰产田是镇团委书记刘振通、青年生产队长寇信和老社员赵守庸共同试验的。他们用的是当地大青刺良种。种前深挖地一尺二寸，每亩施底肥一万五千斤（内有过磷酸钙六十斤），每亩密植四千株，追肥大粪二千五百斤，又浇六次粪稀。为防止白粉病、跑马干，打了三次石灰硫磺合剂，两次波尔多液。黄瓜长得又密又大，一般的二尺多长，二斤多重，大的三尺长，重四斤多。
