　　Refuse to be an Illiterate, Strive to Attend University
　　Narrated by Duan Wenxia, Captain of the Second Brigade of Shuguang (曙光) Cooperative
    I am an old farmer in my fifties, and for most of my life, I have been completely illiterate. From the time I can remember, my family was very poor, without even a small piece of land. It was considered good if we could eat one meal a day. When I was twelve years old, I went to work as a short-term laborer for the landlord. I worked full-time for thirty years, and only stopped after liberation in 1948. When I worked as a laborer, what I earned was used up for food, and as soon as I finished work, there was nothing left to eat. Three hundred and sixty days a year, always worrying about the next meal, how could I have time to study and learn to read? Besides, in those years, the school doors were not open to us poor people.

    Not knowing how to read made me feel dull-witted. When the landlord calculated my wages, he would round down the numbers on the abacus, and I had no choice but to listen to him, not knowing how much I was losing.

    Immediately after liberation, I was in charge of the grain confiscated from the landlord in the village. Anyone who came to collect grain had to have a ticket. But I could weigh things but couldn't read, so I gave out as much as people said they were entitled to, and I was always worried about making mistakes. After that, I have been a cadre in the cooperative. I handled a lot of correspondence, but I was still illiterate, and had to rely on others to help me read everything, just like a cripple can't do without a crutch, really awkward!

    I wanted to learn to read several times, but I was afraid it would be difficult and never succeeded. I felt that I was too old to learn. In 1953, the village opened a literacy class, and I went for three evenings, but then I went to the district for a half-month meeting and stopped going to the literacy class. After that, there were winter schools every year, but I had no interest in attending.

    This year is the Great Leap Forward. I am over fifty years old, but I thought, as long as our workers and peasants are determined, we can make a leap forward in anything, why can't I make a leap forward and learn a few words? Once I made up my mind, things became easier! Our literacy teacher is also committed to teaching, and no matter how stupid I am, the teacher is always patient. No matter how busy I am, I always seize the time to learn. I recognize and write characters in the evenings and during breaks at noon. Even when I came home from a meeting at night, I would study until midnight, sometimes the rooster crowed and I still hadn't gone to sleep. In the fields, I practiced writing characters with my fingers; at home, I used chalk to learn to write on the door panels, boxes, the edge of the kang, and the coal stove. In my room, every nook and cranny was filled with writing. When I first started writing, my hands trembled. Holding the pen felt like holding something weighing many pounds.

    In this way, after a month or so, I learned more than two hundred characters. When I learned to write the three characters "Mao Zedong" and my own name, I was overjoyed. Knowing how to read and write, needless to say, made me feel so relieved and happy.

    Now, my hands are always itching to do something, so I often do some things on the village blackboard newspaper, writing something. But right now I don't recognize many characters, and my education is still very low. I must study hard like I did in the first half of the year, and strive to be able to go to our township's Red Flag University next year! (Attached picture)

　　不当睁眼瞎，争取上大学
　　曙光社第二大队大队长　段文侠口述
    我是一个五十多岁的老农民，我活了大半辈子，都是一个大字不识。从我记事起，家里就很穷，一分地也没有。一天吃得上一顿饭，就算不错。我十二岁那年，就去给地主打短扛活了。整扛了三十年，到1948年解放后才不扛。扛活的时候，上工挣的，作完吃完，一下工就没有吃的。一年三百六十天，吃这顿，奔那顿，老着急，哪里还顾得上读书认字。再说，那年月学堂的大门，也不是冲着咱们穷人开的。
    不识字，心底不灵，地主给我算工钱，算盘一敲，削尖抹零，我只得尽听人家的，不知吃了多少亏。
    乍一解放，我保管村里斗争地主得来的粮食。谁来领粮食，就得凭票证。可我是识秤不识字，听领粮的人说支多少就支多少，心里老嘀咕怕出错。这以后，我一直在社里当干部，在我手里往来的信函特别多，我还是一个大字不识，啥都得靠别人帮我看，就跟瘸子离不开拐棍一样，真别扭！
    我几次想学认字，都怕难没学成。觉着自己岁数大了，学不了啦。1953年，村里开了扫盲班，我也去学了三个晚上，后来我到区里开了半个月会回来，上扫盲班的事又吹了。打这以后，每年都有冬学，我都没有心思上。
    今年大跃进。我是五十多岁的人了，可是我想，咱们工人、农民只要有决心，啥事都能跃进，独我就不能跃进一下学几个字么？下了决心，事情就好办啦！我们的扫盲老师又是包教包学，不管我多笨，老师总是耐着性子教。我也不管有多忙，总是抓了工夫学。晚上没事和歇晌的时候，我认字、写字，就是夜里开会回家，我也一学学到半宵，有时鸡打了鸣我还没有睡。在地里，我用手比划着写字；在家里，我用粉笔在门板上、箱子上、炕沿和煤球炉子上学写字。在我的屋里，犄里角落儿都写满了字。乍下笔，手直哆嗦。笔拿在手里，好像拿了多少斤分量的东西那么沉。
    就这样，过了一个来月，我就学会二百多个字了。我一学会写“毛主席”三个字和自己的名字的时候，甭提有多高兴。会认、会写了，不用说心里有多宽敞，多痛快。
    这会，我老是手痒痒的，好在村里的黑板报上弄弄搞搞，写点什么。不过眼下我识的字还不多，文化还很低，我一定要像上半年那样苦苦学习，争取转过年能够到咱们乡里的红旗大学上学去！（附图片）
