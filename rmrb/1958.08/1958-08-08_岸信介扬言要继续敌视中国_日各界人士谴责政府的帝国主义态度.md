Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi continued to make hostile remarks against the Chinese people at a press conference on the 6th, and counter-accused, saying that "unless Beijing changes its tough attitude towards Japan," there could be no hope for "any improvement" in relations between Japan and China.

Kishi Nobusuke also said that he would continue to conduct "negotiations" with the relevant Chinese authorities on the issue of repatriating so-called Japanese nationals still remaining in mainland China. He also spread the idea that the outcome of such "negotiations" could provide a "good opportunity" to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. People know that the Chinese government and people have, for several years, done everything possible to assist Japanese nationals in returning to their country, even without Japan lifting the state of war. The Kishi Nobusuke government has been using the method of investigating "missing Japanese in China" to stir up nationalistic sentiment in Japan.

Since taking office, Kishi Nobusuke has consistently adopted a policy of antagonizing the Chinese people. Since the spring of this year, he has intensified his actions by undermining the Sino-Japanese trade agreement and condoning thugs who insult the Chinese national flag. Recently, he has even "decided not to prosecute" Kanto, the criminal who insulted the Chinese national flag, openly condoning the act. Kishi Nobusuke is also involved in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Therefore, it is only natural for the Chinese people to resolutely counter Kishi Nobusuke's hostile attitude towards China.

The Chinese people have long made it clear that if the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its hostile attitude towards China, continues to create the conspiracy of "two Chinas," and continues to obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, the Chinese people will not consider any gesture from the Kishi Nobusuke government and will resolutely oppose it. Any threat or intimidation from the Kishi Nobusuke group will not change the Chinese people's solemn stance, nor will it allow it to escape responsibility for undermining Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese people's solemn attitude has been supported by the Japanese people and far-sighted politicians, who strongly condemn the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile policy towards China and demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Akira Kazami, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, issued a statement today on Kishi Nobusuke's remarks at the press conference on the 6th, pointing out that no matter what means the Kishi Nobusuke government uses, the problem cannot be solved as long as it does not change its imperialist policy of hostility towards China. The Kishi Nobusuke government is neither changing its fundamental policy nor seeking to discuss the opening of relations between the two countries with China. This is clearly forcing China to agree to Kishi Nobusuke's anti-China policy, and if China refuses, Kishi Nobusuke will shift the blame to China.

Shinichiro Omori, Secretary-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association, pointed out that the Chinese side's attitude has been completely clarified, but the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude has not changed significantly, which undoubtedly proves that it has not reflected at all on the responsibility it should bear for the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, issued a statement today on Kishi Nobusuke's speech at the press conference, saying that the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards China in its diplomatic policy is the reason for the current state of Sino-Japanese relations. Asanuma stressed that at this time, the Kishi Nobusuke government needs to establish a good-neighborly diplomatic policy that recognizes China.

The person in charge of the Committee for the Implementation of Memorial Services for Chinese Martyrs pointed out today, regarding the so-called investigation into the "unreturned" Japanese in China proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke government, that in the past, due to the Japanese militarists' war of aggression against China and the chaotic post-war situation, some Japanese in China went missing. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for this, and there is no reason to shirk responsibility to China. He also pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government has never shown sincerity regarding the issue of Chinese martyrs and the Liu Lianren issue.

### 岸信介扬言要继续敌视中国  日各界人士谴责政府的帝国主义态度

    岸信介扬言要继续敌视中国
    日各界人士谴责政府的帝国主义态度
    新华社7日讯  东京消息：日本首相岸信介6日在记者招待会上继续发表敌视中国人民的言论，并且反咬一口地说，“除非北京改变它对日本的强硬态度”，否则不能希望日本和中国的关系“有任何改善”。
    岸信介还说，他要继续就所谓仍然留在中国大陆的日侨遣返问题同中国有关当局进行“谈判”。他并且散布空气说，这种“谈判”的结果可以提供一个“良好的机会”来打破中日关系的僵局。人们知道，中国政府和人民已经在同日本没有解除战争状态的情况下几年来在协助日侨归国问题上作到仁至义尽。而岸信介政府一直在用调查“在中国的下落不明的日本人”这种手法，在日本煽动民族情绪。
    岸信介自从执政后，就一直采取与中国人民为敌的政策，今年春以来，更加变本加厉地破坏了日中贸易协定和纵容暴徒侮辱中国国旗，最近又对侮辱中国国旗的罪犯关东“不予起诉”，公然加以放纵。岸信介还参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋。因此，中国人民坚决反击岸信介这种敌视中国的态度，乃是天经地义的。
    中国人民早已表明，如果岸信介政府不改变它对中国的敌视态度，而继续制造“两个中国”的阴谋，继续阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，中国人民就对岸信介政府的任何姿态不予考虑，而且要坚决予以反对。岸信介集团的任何威胁恫吓，完全不可能改变中国人民的严正立场，也不可能摆脱它破坏中日关系的责任。中国人民的严正态度得到了日本人民和有远见的政治家的支持，他们强烈地谴责岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，要求恢复日中邦交。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章今天就岸信介在6日的记者招待会上的言论发表谈话指出，不论岸信介政府使用什么手段，只要它不改变帝国主义的敌视中国的政策，问题是无从解决的。岸信介政府既不改变根本政策，又要和中国商讨打开两国关系，这显然是硬要中国同意岸信介的敌视中国政策，如果中国拒绝，岸信介就要把责任推给中国。
    日中友好协会事务局长大森真一郎指出，中国方面的态度已经完全明确了，但是岸信介政府的态度还没有明显的改变，这不折不扣的证明了它对于在日中关系恶化问题上应负的责任毫无反省。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天就岸信介在记者招待会上的发言发表谈话说，岸信介政府在外交方针方面采取着敌视中国的态度，是使中日关系陷于目前状态的原因。浅沼强调说，在这个时候，岸信介政府需要确定承认中国的睦邻外交方针。
    中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会负责人今天就岸信介政府提出的所谓调查在中国的“未归还”的日本人的问题指出，过去由于日本军国主义对中国进行侵略战争和战后情形混乱，因而有些在中国的日本人下落不明，日本政府对此应负完全责任，完全没有理由把责任推诿给中国。他还指出，岸信介政府对中国殉难者问题、刘连仁问题，始终没有表示过诚意。
