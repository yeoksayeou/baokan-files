　　Earning Five Points Through Labor
　　Yanbian University Incorporates Production Labor into Formal Curriculum
　　(Our newspaper dispatch) Reporters Cheng Yu and Jin Changfan report: Yanbian University has incorporated production labor as a formal course in its teaching plan, placing it on equal footing with other courses. Furthermore, it is using a labor manual system to solidify students' enthusiasm for physical labor.
　　Based on the needs of different majors, Yanbian University has determined the amount of labor time required of students each academic year. The ratio of theoretical teaching to labor time for the entire university averages 2.5:1. This labor time has been incorporated into the weekly schedule. When it is time for labor, students automatically go to the designated places to work. At the end, on-site evaluations are conducted in groups. The evaluation criteria include not only the quantity and value of labor, but also labor enthusiasm and attitude. After the evaluation, the group leader records the results in the labor manual, so that grades can be assigned at the end of the semester using a four-level grading system.
　　Yanbian University has more than 1,600 students, all children of the Korean ethnic group. Although more than 96% come from worker and peasant families, the idea and actions of looking down on physical labor were relatively common among these students in the past due to education being divorced from production labor. Many students believed that college students should not engage in physical labor. Helping farmers with rice planting, weeding, and dike repair, which only took five or six days each year, was also considered to affect teaching quality; even campus cleaning campaigns had to rely on civil servants. At the beginning of the rectification movement, many people took the opportunity to air grievances, complaining about poor school facilities and too few civil servants, and blaming the higher authorities for not daring to ask the central government for people and money. After the anti-rightist struggle, although these students drew a clear line between themselves and the bourgeoisie politically, the bad habits of laziness and extravagance in their thinking were not fundamentally overcome; moreover, they were exposed again as opinions against the leadership during the rectification stage. Later, a university-wide red-expert debate raised the awareness of most students and began to change them. However, some students still insisted on the above-mentioned wrong opinions. At this time, the school, focusing on the characteristics of the vast majority of worker and peasant family backgrounds, launched a recall and comparison movement, allowing students to universally recall family life, compare life before and after liberation, and select typical examples to make enlightening reports to the entire school. It also invited martyrs' families, military dependents, student families, and labor models from outside the school to give lectures; school leaders also publicly reviewed their responsibility for failing to effectively implement the proletarian education line in the school. In this way, the students were greatly moved, unanimously examined their forgetfulness, and established the concept that labor is glorious and not laboring is shameful, greatly improving their political awareness and strengthening their labor concept. Students generally formulated labor plans. The school accepted the students' suggestions and implemented the labor manual system from March of this year. In addition to on-campus labor, the three colleges also signed labor contracts with the surrounding three townships, stipulating the time for students to participate in voluntary labor throughout the year and undertaking the propaganda, education, and health care work of the three townships.
　　Now, each student of the Teachers College and Medical College of Yanbian University has done more than 300 hours of labor in the four months since the implementation of the labor manual, approaching the completion of the annual labor volume stipulated in the labor manual. However, the students of the various colleges are not satisfied with only completing the prescribed labor volume.
　　In the past half month, more than 800 teachers and students from the Teachers College and Medical College have continued to go to various parts of the autonomous prefecture to help farmers repair reservoirs and accumulate fertilizer in accordance with the contracts stipulated in the labor manual; the graduating class has put forward the slogan "Graduate in Labor," completing more than double the quota every day. Some teachers and students staying at the two colleges are busily preparing to set up brick, tile, cement, refractory material, and coke factories and industries such as paper making and chemical fertilizers centered on steel, and some products have been successfully trial-produced.
　　At the same time, in order to adhere to the labor manual system and better combine education and labor, education and politics, teachers and students of various colleges are launching discussions on teaching reform on the labor sites. Based on the experience of the previous few months, the Teachers College and Medical College plan to complete the classroom theory courses that used to be studied for four and five years respectively in two or three years, and use the remaining two years to focus on teaching and medical practice.
　　After participating in labor, students' thoughts and feelings began to change. In the past, students were most afraid of rain, because it was inconvenient to go to the city to watch movies when it rained. This year, when there was a shortage of rain, they were all concerned about the crops they planted and hoped for rain like the farmers. When students encounter difficulties in labor, they think that workers and peasants have overcome so many difficulties that they feel that the difficulties in front of them are insignificant, and they muster up the energy to overcome the difficulties. The knowledge that students have learned from books has also been consolidated in labor, thereby improving the quality of learning. (Attached picture)

### 在劳动中争得五分　延边大学把生产劳动列入正式课程

　　在劳动中争得五分
　　延边大学把生产劳动列入正式课程
    本报讯　记者程予、金昌范报道：延边大学已经把劳动生产作为一门课程列入教学计划，与其他课程平起平坐，并且运用劳动手册的方法，把学生从事体力劳动的热情巩固下来。
    延边大学根据不同专业的需要，确定了学生每学年的劳动时间。全校理论教学和劳动时间的比例，平均为二·五比一。这些劳动时间，已分别纳入每周作息时间表。每到劳动时间，学生就自动进入指定场所进行劳动。结束时，以小组为单位举行现场评比。评比的标准不只是劳动数量和价值多少，而且包括劳动热情和劳动态度。评比后由小组负责人把评比结果记入劳动手册，以便学期末按四级分制法评定成绩。
    延边大学共有一千六百多名学生，都是朝鲜族人民子女，其中虽然96％以上是工农家庭成分。但是，过去由于教育脱离生产劳动，那种轻视体力劳动的思想和行动，在这些学生中，也是较普遍的。不少学生认为大学生不应该从事体力劳动。对帮助农民插秧、锄草、修堤等每年仅占去五、六天的时间，也认为影响教学质量；甚至连校内清洁卫生运动也要依赖公务员进行。整风初期，更有不少人借此鸣放，嫌学校设备不好，公务员太少；怨上级不敢向中央提出要人要钱。反右派斗争以后，这些学生虽然在政治上和资产阶级划清了界限，但思想上好逸恶劳，爱阔气讲排场的毛病，并未因此而得到根本克服；而且在整改阶段又一次作为对领导的意见暴露出来。后经全校性的红专辩论，使大部分学生认识提高，开始转变。但部分学生仍坚持上述错误意见。这时，学校即针对绝大部分工农家庭成分的特点，开展了回忆对比运动，让学生普遍回忆家庭生活，进行解放前后对比，并选择典型向全校作启发报告，还从校外邀请烈、军属、学生家属、劳动模范等来校讲课；学校领导也当众检讨了在校内贯彻无产阶级教育路线不力的责任。这样，使学生们大受感动，一致检查自己的忘本思想，从而树立劳动光荣、不劳动可耻的观念，政治觉悟大大提高，劳动观念也加强了。学生们普遍制定了劳动规划。学校接受学生们的建议，从今年3月起就实行劳动手册制度。除校内劳动外，三个学院还分别和周围三个乡订立劳动合同，规定学生全年参加义务劳动的时间，并担任三个乡的宣传、教育与卫生医疗工作。
    现在，延边大学师范、医学院的每个学生，在实行劳动手册的四个多月内，已经作了三百多小时劳动，接近完成劳动手册所规定的全年劳动量。但是，各学院的学生，并不满足于只完成规定的劳动量。
    最近半个月来，师范、医学两个学院八百多名师生，继续按照劳动手册所规定的合同，分赴自治州各地帮助农民修水库和积肥；应届毕业班的学生，提出“在劳动中毕业”的口号，每天完成定额一倍多。这两个学院的部分留校师生正紧张筹办以钢铁为中心的砖瓦、水泥、耐火材料、焦炭工厂和造纸、化学肥料等工业，并且已有部分产品试制成功。
    同时，为了坚持劳动手册制度，并使教育和劳动、教育和政治更好地结合起来，各学院师生都在劳动工地上，展开教学改革的讨论。师范、医学两个学院根据前几个月的经验，准备把过去学四年和五年的课堂理论课程，分别在二、三年内学完，用其余二年着重进行教学和医疗实习。
    学生们经过参加劳动以后，思想感情开始发生变化。过去学生们最怕下雨，因为下雨到市内看电影不便。今年缺雨的时候，他们都关心自己种的庄稼，和农民一样盼着下雨。学生们在劳动中遇到困难的时候，一想到工人农民不知战胜了多少困难，便觉得自己眼前这点困难微不足道，就鼓起克服困难的干劲。学生们在书本上学到的知识，也在劳动中得到巩固，从而提高了学习质量。（附图片）
