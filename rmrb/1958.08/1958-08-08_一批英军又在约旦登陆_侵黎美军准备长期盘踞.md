    新华社7日讯  据西方通讯社安曼消息，6日晚上又有大批英国侵略军分别在安曼机场和约旦南部的亚喀巴港登陆。
    在以色列屈从美国和英国的压力重新允许它们的飞机飞越以色列领空以后，美国的全球霸王式运输机在6日晚间立即把英国的“爱尔兰近卫队”的伞兵从塞浦路斯运到安曼。
    与此同时，英国运输舰也把一批新的英国侵略军运到亚喀巴港。据西方通讯社透露，在亚喀巴登陆的这批英国侵略军是从亚丁或英属东非运来的，但是没有透露这批侵略军队的番号和人数。消息说，他们将被空运到安曼，以加强已经在那里的几千名英国侵略军伞兵。
    新华社7日讯  贝鲁特消息：侵占黎巴嫩的美国军队为了在黎巴嫩盘踞下去，他们已经开始同夏蒙政府当局签订一系列的租用和供应合同。
    据美国驻黎巴嫩大使馆的官员6日承认，已经签订或正在谈判签订的一部分合同约值十万美元。这些合同将包括租用仓库和营房等。他还透露，美国将通过一些供应合同来搜刮黎巴嫩的水果、糖果、蔬菜、冰块等以供侵占黎巴嫩的美国侵略军享用。
    据报道，美国侵略军继续在黎巴嫩登陆，并且把战斗装备运到岸上。6日有四架美国侵略军的运输机把军队和装备运到贝鲁特北面的安特利亚斯。
    同时，美国侵略军飞机不断在黎巴嫩上空飞行，进行恫吓。据侵黎美军发言人6日承认，有一架美国侵略军飞机从停在黎巴嫩海面的航空母舰起飞后不久，就坠落在海里。飞行员毙命，连尸体也找不到。
