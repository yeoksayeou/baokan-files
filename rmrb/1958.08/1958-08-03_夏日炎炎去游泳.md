Swimming in the Scorching Summer Heat

There are two kinds of rest: active and passive. The great Russian physiologist Sechenov proved that complete quiet rest after work (i.e., so-called passive rest) is not the most effective rest; the most effective rest is switching from one activity to another (i.e., so-called active rest). Active rest is more beneficial for healthy people to eliminate fatigue, while passive rest is only suitable for the elderly and the sick.

In the hot summer, swimming is the best form of active rest. Don't be afraid that tanned skin is not beautiful. The most beautiful skin is this kind of healthy, bronze-colored skin, rather than that kind of morbid "fairness." The poet Mayakovsky once praised:

	"...In the world
	There is no
	More beautiful clothing
	Than strong muscles
	And fresh skin."

Swimming can develop our respiratory organs. Generally, swimmers' vital capacity reaches about five liters, or even six or seven liters, which is not only greater than that of ordinary people, but also greater than that of athletes engaged in other sports (such as gymnastics, weightlifting, track and field, etc.). The range of chest movement is also very large, that is, the difference between full and empty (that is, the difference in chest circumference when inhaling and exhaling) can generally reach fifteen centimeters, while ordinary people only have six to eight centimeters.

Swimming also has a great impact on the heart. If we participate in a competition, the heart rate can reach 180 to 200 beats per minute. Therefore, people who often swim have thicker heart walls, stronger contraction strength, and more blood pumped out with each contraction than ordinary people.

Swimming is better than other sports in comprehensively developing our muscles and the vestibule (the vestibule is inside the ear and manages body balance), because almost all muscle groups in the body participate in activities during swimming, and in order to maintain stability in the water and move forward, it also promotes the ability of our vestibular sensory organs.

In addition, because water is a good conductor of heat and easily dissipates heat, people dissipate more heat when swimming than on land, and people feel cooler.

All those who participate in swimming must have their bodies checked by a doctor. People with heart disease and lung disease cannot swim; people with venereal diseases, skin diseases, severe trachoma, athlete's foot (commonly known as dampness), ear discharge, and conjunctivitis must first cure the disease to avoid spreading it to others.

Most elderly people's blood vessels are sclerotic and lack elasticity. Under the stimulation of water temperature, the blood vessels will spasm sharply, blood pressure will rise significantly, making the heart work hard and even causing blood vessel rupture (i.e., cerebral congestion or stroke). Therefore, the elderly must first undergo a thorough examination by a doctor to determine whether they can swim.

Children have weak resistance to low temperatures, so they should not stay in the water for too long. Children must be supervised by adults to avoid danger.

Women should not swim during menstruation and pregnancy.

When swimming, due to the sudden change from a hot environment to a cold environment, people will temporarily have difficulty breathing, goosebumps all over their bodies, and vasospasm, but this will disappear after a while, and the skin will turn red (skin blood vessels dilate, congestion). However, if you stay in the water for too long, or the water is too cold, your lips will turn blue, your skin will turn pale, you will get goosebumps all over your body, and even shiver. This is a phenomenon of dysregulation of body temperature and you should quickly go ashore to bask in the sun, or run and do gymnastics. Generally, beginners should stay in the water for 10 to 15 minutes each time, and children for 3 to 5 minutes. People who swim regularly can appropriately extend the time. In short, don't stay in the water for a long time, you must go ashore to rest frequently. When getting out of the water, immediately dry your body with a towel, rub your skin to make it warm, or do some gymnastics or running. Pay special attention to this on windy days, otherwise you will easily catch a cold.

Before entering the water, you must first do some preparatory activities. You can do a few sections of gymnastics and running to move all the joints of your body and warm up all the muscles. After the other organs of your body are ready, enter the water. This will avoid cramps after entering the water. When starting to enter the water, first wipe your chest and back with water in the shallow water area to avoid catching a cold suddenly.

Many people like to sunbathe in the middle of swimming. Sunbathing can make the body obtain Vitamin D and increase the body's resistance. However, the sun exposure time should not be too long. For beginners, the limit is five to ten minutes, and then gradually increase it every day, up to no more than half an hour. When sunbathing, people should lie down on the ground, and the position of the body exposed to the sun should be changed every three to five minutes. It is best to wear black or green sunglasses to prevent ultraviolet rays from damaging the eyes. People who are too weak should not sunbathe.

    夏日炎炎去游泳
    北京体育学院生理教研组　高强
    休息有积极的和消极的两种。伟大的俄罗斯生理学家谢切诺夫证明：在工作后完全安静的休息（即所谓消极的休息），不是最有效的休息；最有效的休息是从一种活动转换到另一种活动（即所谓积极的休息）。积极的休息更有利于健康人消除疲劳，消极的休息只适宜于老年人和病人。
    在炎热的夏天，游泳是最好的一种积极的休息。不要怕晒黑皮肤不美观，最漂亮的皮肤，正是这种晒成了古铜色的健康皮肤，而不是那种病态的“白晰”，诗人马雅柯夫斯基就曾经歌颂过：
    “……世界上
    没有
    更美丽的衣裳
    像结实的肌肉
    与新鲜的皮肤一样。”
    游泳时能使我们的呼吸器官得到发展。一般游泳运动员的肺活量都达到五公升左右，甚至达到六、七公升，不仅比普通人的肺活量要大，而且比从事其他运动的运动员（如体操、举重、田径等）也大得多。胸廓活动的幅度也很大，即盈虚差（也就是吸气和呼吸时胸围的差度）一般可以达到十五公分，普通人只有六到八公分。
    游泳对心脏的影响也很大。假如我们参加比赛，心跳次数可以到每分钟一百八十到二百次。所以时常参加游泳的人，心脏壁的肌肉比一般人要厚些，收缩的力量也要大些，每次压送出的血量也要多些。
    游泳比其他运动更能全面地发达我们的肌肉和前庭（前庭在耳朵里面，能管身体平衡），因为在游泳时，差不多全身各部肌肉群都参加活动，而且为了维持在水内平稳地前进，也就促进了我们前庭感觉器官的能力。
    另外，由于水是热的良好导体，容易散热，所以人在游泳时比在陆地上要发散更多的热能，人就感到凉爽。
    凡参加游泳的人，都要经过医师检查身体。有心脏病、肺病的人不能游泳；有花柳病、皮肤病、重沙眼、脚癣（俗名湿气）、耳流脓、眼结膜炎等病的人，必须先把病治好，以免传给别人。
    老年人的血管多半发生硬化，弹性弱，在水温刺激下，会使血管急剧痉挛，血压显著升高，使心脏工作困难甚至引起血管破裂（即脑充血或中风）。因此，老年人必须先经过医生周密的检查，才能确定是否可以游泳。
    儿童对低温的抵抗力较弱，所以在水里耽搁时间不宜太长。游泳时必须有大人在旁照顾，以免发生危险。
    妇女在月经期及怀孕期，都不能游泳。
    游泳的人，入水时，由于从热环境突然到冷环境中，暂时会呼吸困难，浑身起鸡皮疙瘩，血管痉挛，但稍过一会就会消除的，而且皮肤会发红（皮肤血管舒张，充血）。但是，如果在水里呆的时间太长，或是水太凉，就会嘴唇发青，皮肤苍白，浑身起鸡皮疙瘩，甚至打寒战。这是体温调节失调的现象，应该赶快上岸晒晒太阳，或是跑跑步，作作体操。一般初学游泳的人，每次在水里的时间最好在十到十五分钟，小孩三到五分钟。经常游泳的人，时间就可以适当延长。总之，不要长时间停在水里，必须经常上岸休息。在出水时，应立刻用毛巾擦干身体，摩擦皮肤使它发热，或稍微作体操或跑步。有风的天气尤其应当注意这点，否则容易感冒。
    入水以前，必须先作些准备活动，可以先作几节体操和跑步，把身体各关节都活动活动，使浑身的肌肉都温暖起来，身体其他器官也都作好了准备之后再下水，这样就可以避免下水后发生抽筋。开始下水时，先在浅水区用水擦擦胸，冲冲背，免得突然下去容易着凉。
    很多人喜欢在游泳中间晒晒日光浴。日光浴可以使身体获得丁种维生素，增加身体的抵抗力。但是晒的时间不宜过长，初晒的人以五到十分钟为限度，以后每天逐渐增加，最多不超过半小时，日光浴时，人应当卧倒在地上，身体所晒的位置每隔三到五分钟要转换一次。最好还戴上黑色或绿色的太阳镜，防止紫外线对眼睛的损害。身体过分衰弱的人，不可实行日光浴。
