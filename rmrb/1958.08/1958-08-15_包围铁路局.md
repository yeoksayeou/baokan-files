　　Surrounding the Railway Bureau
　　Organized by the Tianjin Vehicle Spring Factory History Editing Group
　　After the Japanese devils surrendered, Hu Zhishou, a receiving official of the Kuomintang, took over as the factory director. For three or four months in a row, the workers' wages were either delayed or paid at a 60% rate. In those years, prices soared, and grain prices changed several times. The money the workers received wasn't even enough to eat, let alone have the energy to work? A flame of resistance was burning in the hearts of the workers. Wang Junchen and other comrades, who were in charge of the underground Party organization in the factory, promptly analyzed the workers' demands for better living conditions and their anti-ruling emotions. They believed that since the Lunar New Year was approaching and the workers couldn't even maintain a minimal standard of living, the Party organization should immediately organize and mobilize the workers to fight and demand that the factory pay their wages, leading from economic struggle to political struggle. After requesting instructions from the higher Party committee, they immediately began preparations for a strike.
　　With only a dozen days left until the Lunar New Year, wages and flour hadn't been distributed. People had reached the end of their patience. On a freezing day, under the leadership of the Party, the workers surrounded the factory director's office, blocking it completely. Everyone shouted, "We want to eat! Give us our back pay!" Worker Wang Wentong angrily pointed his finger at factory director Hu Zhishou and said, "I'm going to hit you! Do you believe it?!" "I... I... I believe it..." Hu Zhishou answered wretchedly, trembling all over with fear.
　　Fearing a beating, Hu Zhishou quickly sent the smiling tiger Engineer Han to intercede for him, saying, "The problem of not paying wages isn't up to Director Hu; only the Railway Bureau can decide! Please give us a few more days so that Director Hu can ask for instructions."
　　Who knew that half a month passed with no news? The workers sent representatives to question the factory director, but Hu Zhishou put on a pitiful face and prevaricated, saying, "It's not that I don't want to help everyone, but the Railway Bureau won't agree. I really can't do anything..." "Alright! We'll go ask the Railway Bureau!" the workers shouted in unison.
　　December 26th of the lunar calendar was a cold day with howling winds. The wind was like a small knife scraping against people's faces. At a little after 10 o'clock, a large contingent of more than 500 workers from the factory marched mightily toward the North Station. More than 100 unemployed railway workers also came, forming a grand force of more than 600 people. At this time, Liu Mingshi, a factory puppet union cadre, ran over in a panic, smiling hypocritically and saying, "What are you doing?"
　　"Going to the Railway Bureau to ask for money!" the workers answered like thunder.
　　"Go back first! I'll take care of things for you? I'll handle everything!"
　　"Having you is as good as not having us, get out of the way!"
　　When they arrived at the North Station Railway Bureau, everyone suddenly surrounded all four entrances, not allowing anyone to enter or exit. The courtyard was also crowded with people. The staff of the Railway Bureau were scared out of their wits and tightly closed the doors and windows, not letting anyone out.
　　When the workers saw that the doors and windows were all closed, they began to smash the doors. People cheered and encouraged them from the sidelines, scaring them even more so that they didn't dare to open the doors. Someone who couldn't smash the door picked up a stone and threw it at the window. With a "crash," a large pane of glass was shattered.
　　In a short while, more than forty railway policemen with guns, like mad dogs, came running. Their guns were all fitted with shining bayonets. Under the command of the police chief, they surrounded the workers. But these policemen, upon seeing the angry workers, were like deflated balloons, suddenly losing their momentum, staring blankly at the surrounding crowd. The police chief, seeing that things were not looking good, immediately ran up and hypocritically said to the workers, "We are here to protect you!" The workers immediately exposed his trickery, saying, "Humph! That sounds good. You're holding guns to protect us? Let me tell you, we're not afraid to die to get what we want!" The police chief had no choice but to remain silent.
　　A beautiful small car drove straight to the front of the Railway Bureau. A middle-aged man wearing a camel-hair hat, a sea otter-collared coat, and shiny leather shoes got out of the car. The workers swarmed him and asked, "Who are you? Are you the bureau chief?"
　　He stammered, "I... I'm not the bureau chief."
　　A sentry on duty gave the crowd a wink. The workers understood that this was Bureau Chief Liu, and they surrounded him in an instant. Everyone clamored, "We have nothing to eat, we want our pay!" "Why aren't you giving us our pay!" Jiang Guotai, a worker in the front, grabbed his coat collar and angrily asked, "Whose coat are you wearing? Look at what we're wearing!" Everyone followed suit and shouted, "Yes! We want our pay, we want to eat!" Seeing that things were going badly, this guy tried to get back in the car and slip away, but people quickly grabbed him and prevented him from getting in the car. Workers Cui Jiuxiang and Jiang Guotai cleverly removed the engine nozzle from the car, and the car could no longer move. This guy immediately put on a smiling face and said, "Brothers, please come inside and sit down, we can talk things over slowly!" So a group of workers followed him into the office. As soon as this guy entered the room, he picked up the phone, wanting to contact the outside world for help and relief. When the workers saw this, they added fuel to the fire, "Oh, you're lying to us!" The workers who were close to him grabbed the phone. At this moment, the workers outside shouted thunderously, "Charge in, smash the Railway Bureau!" "Beat him, beat him to death!" "Drag him out!"
　　Under the pressure of the workers, this guy had no choice but to verbally agree to give everyone their back pay tomorrow. Fearing that there was no proof, the workers wanted him to write a guarantee. He had to nod repeatedly and say, "Okay, okay!" Finally, he reluctantly wrote a note and stamped it. Only then did everyone let him go.
　　As soon as the news of the victory of the strike spread, all the workers cheered loudly. The team marched mightily along Dajin Road (now Zhongshan Road) towards Jingang Bridge and began a demonstration parade. Everyone shouted slogans such as "We want to eat!" "Give us our pay!" and so on. Along the way, it attracted tens of thousands of people.
　　As the team passed the Zhouwei Road intersection, two Kuomintang motorcycles "beep-beeped" from behind. The drivers ran to the front of the team and shouted in a high voice, "Brothers, brothers! You've worked too hard, everyone don't move forward, go back and rest!" The marching workers completely ignored their shouting and continued to advance with majestic steps.
　　Three days later, it was exactly the 29th of the lunar month, and wages and flour were distributed in full. In addition to this factory, the employees of the North Station, West Station, and other places also received their wages.
　　The struggle was victorious. The next day, representatives from the North Station, West Station, Locomotive Depot, and other railway sections came to express their condolences to the factory employees. The factory was truly lively and extraordinary, and everyone was happy for several days in a row. (Attached picture)

　　天津车辆弹簧厂工厂史编辑组整理
    日本鬼子投降以后，国民党的接收大员胡志寿担任了厂长，一连三、四个月，工人的工资不是拖期发给，就是按六折发给。那年头物价飞涨，粮食价格一时数变，工人拿到的钱，连吃饭都接不上顿，哪还有心思干活呢？一股反抗的火焰，在工人们的心里燃烧起来了。工厂中的地下党组织负责人王俊臣等同志及时地分析了当时工人的生活要求和对统治者的反抗情绪，认为当前正是旧历年关逼近，而工人连最低的生活都维持不下去，党组织应该立即组织发动工人进行斗争，要厂方发放工资；由经济斗争引向政治斗争。经过向上级党委请示，立即进行罢工的准备工作。
    离旧历年只有十几天了，工资和面粉还是没发下来。人们已经忍无可忍，在一个严寒的日子，工人们在党的领导下，把厂长室围得水泄不通，大家嚷着：“我们要吃饭！给我们补工钱！”工人王文桐愤怒地指着厂长胡志寿的鼻子说：“我要揍你！你信不信！？”“信……信……信……”胡志寿狼狈地回答。吓得他浑身发抖。
    胡志寿恐怕挨揍，连忙派出笑面虎韩工程师为他讲情，说：“不发工资问题不在胡厂长，这要铁路局才能决定呀！请大家宽限几天，叫胡厂长请示一下。
    谁知半个月过去了，音信全无，工人派代表去质问厂长，胡志寿装出一副可怜相，搪塞地说：“我并不是不给大伙办，铁路局不答应，我实在没法子……”“好！我们去问铁路局！”工人们不约而同地喊着。
    腊月26日，那是一个寒风呼啸的冷天，风像小刀子似的刮在人们的脸上，十点多钟，工厂五百多人的大队，浩浩荡荡地向北站进发，一百多名失业铁路工人也赶来了，组成六百多人的雄壮队伍。这时厂伪工会干事刘明石慌慌张张地跑来了，假惺惺地笑着说：“你们干嘛去？”
    “找铁路局要钱去！”工人像雷声一样的回答。
    “你们先回去！有嘛事我给你们办？凡事有我啦！”
    “有你可没我们啦，滚开吧！”
    到了北站铁路局，大家呼拉一下子把四个门口都团团围住，不许外人出入，院子里也到处挤满了人，铁路局的人员都吓得魂不附体，紧紧地关上了门窗，不放一个人出来。
    工人们一看门窗都关了，就去砸门，人们在一旁呼喊助威，吓得他们更不敢开门了。有人看砸不开门就拾起一块石头，朝窗口扔去，“哗啦”一声，一块大玻璃被打得粉碎。
    不一会儿，四十多个端着枪的铁路警察像疯狗似地跑来了，他们的枪上都安着闪闪发光的刺刀，在警长的指挥下围住了工人，可是这些一看到愤怒的工人，就像漏气的皮球，一下子就泄了气，呆呆地望着周围的人群。警长一看风声不对，马上跑上来假情假意地向工人说：“我们是来保卫你们的！”工人们立即揭穿他的鬼把戏说：“哼！说得倒好，你们是拿枪来保护我们呀，告诉你们，我们要出来就不怕死！”警长只好一句话也不说。
    一辆漂亮的小卧车直开到铁路局门前，从车上下来一个头戴驼绒帽，身披水獭领子大衣亮皮鞋的中年人，工人们像蜂拥似的挤上去问他：“你是什么人？是局长吗？”
    他吞吞吐吐地说：“我……我不是局长。”
    旁边一个站岗的路警向大伙使了个眼色，工人一见，明白这就是刘局长，呼拉一下就把这家伙包围了。大家抢着说：“我们都没吃的，我们要开支！”“为什么不给开支！”挤在前边的工人姜国泰拉着他的大衣领子愤怒地问道：“你穿的大衣是谁的？你看我们穿的是嘛？”大家都跟着嚷：“对！我们要开支，我们要吃饭！”这家伙一看事不妙，就想上车溜掉，人们忙把他拉住不叫他上车，工人崔久祥、姜国泰两人机警地把汽车内燃机嘴子拔掉了，汽车再也开不走了。这家伙马上堆着笑脸说：“弟兄们，请大家屋里坐好吧，有事慢慢谈！”于是一群工人就紧跟着他进了办公室。这小子一进屋就操起了电话，想向外联络求援解围。工人们一见，更是火上加油，“好嘛，原来你骗人！”离他近的工人，一把就夺过了电话，这时外面工人喊声震天：“打进去，砸铁路局！”“打他，打死他！”“把他拉出来！”
    在工人的逼迫下，这家伙无可奈何，口头答应，明天给大家补发工资，怕空口无凭，工人们要他写保条，他只好点头连连说：“可以，可以！”最后勉强地给大家写了条子盖了章，大家才算放了他。
    罢工胜利的消息一传出来，全体工人高声欢呼。队伍浩浩荡荡地顺着大津路（现在的中山路）奔向金钢桥开始了示威游行，大家高呼着：“我们要饭吃！”“给我们开支！”等口号。沿途吸引了成千上万的人群。
    队伍走过宙纬路口，从后面“嘟嘟”地开来了两辆国民党摩托车，开车的跑到队伍前边，高着嗓门跟大家说：“弟兄们，弟兄呵！你们太辛苦了，大家别向前走了，还是回去休息吧！”游行的工人，根本没理他们的叫喊，仍然迈着雄壮的步伐，继续前进。
    三天以后，正是旧历29日，工资和面粉，照数发下来了，除本厂外，北站、西站等处职工也都发了工资。
    斗争胜利了，转天，北站、西站机务段等处路工都派来了代表，向本厂职工慰问，厂里真是热闹非凡，大伙一连高兴了好几天。（附图片）
