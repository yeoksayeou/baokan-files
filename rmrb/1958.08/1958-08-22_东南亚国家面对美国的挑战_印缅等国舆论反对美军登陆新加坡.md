Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th - The "Deccan Herald" published an editorial today reminding everyone to pay attention to the event of 2,000 U.S. Marines landing in Singapore. It said: "The U.S. action will cause resentment throughout Southeast Asia."

The editorial said: "It not only brings the Cold War to this region, but it is also a challenge to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Southeast Asian countries."

The editorial said: "This exercise in 'Marine Corps diplomacy' is too frequent for world peace." It said: "Neither India nor most countries in this region can allow their neutrality to be trampled on by the United States or any other country."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st - Vietnam's "Nhan Dan" published an editorial today, demanding that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from Singapore.

The editorial said that the entry of American troops into Singapore has intensified the tense situation in Southeast Asia and seriously threatens the peace and tranquility of various countries in the Southeast Asian region. The editorial said that while sending troops to Singapore, the United States has also stepped up the transportation of weapons to Japan and West Irian, instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to harass the Chinese coast, and continued to interfere in South Vietnam. Such behavior by the United States is an unforgivable provocation. With the rise of national independence movements and the strength of the socialist camp surpassing that of the imperialist camp, such arrogant behavior is too presumptuous.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st - "Indonesia Torch" published a commentary today stating that the landing of U.S. troops in Singapore is a threat to the Asian and African people who oppose foreign troops entering the Middle East, especially to the Indonesian people.

The newspaper said that the U.S. sending troops to land in Singapore is in preparation for the situation after its failure in the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Middle East issue. The newspaper said that the vast majority of Asian and African people do not approve of foreign troops landing in the Middle East and demand that these troops withdraw immediately. The Indonesian people are particularly determined to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East. Therefore, the U.S. sending troops to land in Singapore is a threat to the Asian and African people, especially to the Indonesian people, because Singapore is closest to Indonesian territory.

"Indonesia Torch" also published today a speech by Manai Soefian, chairman of the National Defense Committee of the Parliament. He said that the Indonesian people are deeply disturbed by the landing of U.S. troops in Singapore.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 21st - The Presidium of the Burma National United Front held a meeting on the 20th, condemning the U.S. government for concentrating its navy in the Indian Ocean and demanding that these navies immediately withdraw from this region.

The Presidium of the Burma National United Front believes that since part of the Indian Ocean is Burmese territorial waters, the presence of the U.S. fleet in the Indian Ocean is a serious threat to Burmese sovereignty.

"Burma New Era" pointed out in an editorial today that the U.S.'s high-sounding excuse that the Seventh Fleet may go to guarantee the obligations the United States undertakes in the Indian Ocean is definitely a lie deliberately fabricated by relevant U.S. parties. In fact, they want to extend the scope of the Seventh Fleet's activities to the peaceful Indian Ocean.

The newspaper said, "The Colombo countries will undoubtedly not stand idly by or be dictated to. They will definitely demand that the parties concerned withdraw their warships from this part of the sea."

　　东南亚国家面对美国的挑战
    印缅等国舆论反对美军登陆新加坡
    据新华社新德里20日电  “德干先驱报”今天发表社论提醒大家要注意两千名美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆的事件。它说：“美国的行动将在东南亚各地引起愤慨。”
    社论说：“它不仅把冷战带到这个地区来，而且是对东南亚国家领土完整和主权的挑战。”
    社论说：“这种‘海军陆战队外交’的演习，对世界和平来说，是太经常了。”它说：“不论印度或者这个地区的多数国家都不能允许它们的中立受到美国或任何其他国家的践踏。”
    据新华社河内21日电  越南“人民报”今天发表社论，要求美国军队立即撤出新加坡。
    社论说，美国军队开入新加坡的行为加剧了东南亚的紧张局势，严重威胁到东南亚地区各国的和平和安宁。社论说，在出兵新加坡的同时，美国还加紧把武器运到日本和西伊里安，唆使台湾蒋介石集团骚扰中国沿海一带，并且继续干涉南越。美国的这种行为是不可饶恕的挑衅行为。在民族独立运动高涨和社会主义阵营的力量超过帝国主义阵营力量的情况下，这种狂妄的行为是太不自量了。
    新华社雅加达21日电  “印度尼西亚火炬报”今天发表评论说，美军在新加坡登陆，是对反对外国出兵中东的亚非人民的威胁，特别是对印度尼西亚人民的威胁。
    这家报纸说，美国派遣军队在新加坡登陆，是准备应付它在联合国大会紧急会议关于中东问题的讨论中遭到失败后的局面。这家报纸说，绝大多数的亚非人民都不赞成外国军队在中东登陆，并且要求这些军队立即撤退。印度尼西亚人民特别坚决要求外国军队撤出中东。因此，美国派遣军队在新加坡登陆是对亚非人民、特别是对印度尼西亚人民的威胁，因为新加坡最靠近印度尼西亚的领土。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”今天还刊载了国会国防委员会主席马纳伊·索菲安的一篇谈话。他说，印度尼西亚人民对于美军在新加坡登陆深感不安。
    据新华社仰光21日电  缅甸民族团结阵线主席团在20日举行会议，谴责美国政府把它的海军集结到印度洋来，而且要求这些海军立即撤出这个地区。
    缅甸民族团结阵线主席团认为，由于印度洋的一部分是缅甸的领海，因此，美国舰队驻在印度洋是对缅甸主权的一个严重威胁。
    “缅甸新时代报”今天在社论中指出，美国的冠冕堂皇的借口是第七舰队可能要去保障美国在印度洋上所承担的义务，这种借口肯定是美国有关方面故意制造的谎言，实际上他们想使第七舰队的活动范围伸展到和平的印度洋来。
    这家报纸说，“科伦坡各国无疑是不会袖手旁观或者听凭摆布的，它们一定会要求有关方面把他们的军舰撤出这部分海面。”
