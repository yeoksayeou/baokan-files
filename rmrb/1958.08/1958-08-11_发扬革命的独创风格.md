　　Promote a Revolutionary and Original Style
　　Zhang Feng
　　A new type of amateur textile technical school affiliated with the Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Factory has opened, marking a significant leap forward in Shanghai's workers' spare-time education. This school, starting from the urgent needs of the factory's technical revolution and the characteristics of workers possessing rich practical production knowledge, and based on the teaching principle of combining politics, culture, and technology, has formulated a new educational system. It strives to enable all young and middle-aged workers in the factory, including those who are illiterate, to reach the level of graduation from a higher textile technical school in about six years.

　　Enabling an illiterate person to reach the level of graduation from a higher technical school in about six years was unimaginable in the past. When the Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Factory put forward this grand plan, a struggle between advanced and conservative thinking also unfolded. Skeptics and opponents believed that they must stick to conventions; while the workers used their already rich experience in political struggle and production knowledge, and their high enthusiasm for learning culture, to explain that they must break with conventions. The latter's opinion finally prevailed. This is a victory for implementing the policy of facing reality and facing production in workers' spare-time education, a revolutionary measure in workers' spare-time education, and also the direction of the development of workers' spare-time education.

　　Marxists and Leninists have always believed that the superstructure should serve its economic base and promote the development of production. As a part of the superstructure, the education cause naturally needs to implement the policy of facing production and facing reality. However, production and reality are not empty concepts. Each factory has its different production needs and its different realities. If workers' spare-time education is to correctly implement the policy of facing production and facing reality, it must formulate different educational systems and teaching content based on the different production needs and actual conditions of each factory. The Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Factory's workers' spare-time technical school has formulated a clear goal for itself based on the urgent needs of the factory's grand technical revolution plan—to cultivate a technical team for the textile industry. Therefore, bold additions and deletions were made to the curriculum. This is a very necessary measure. Various factories can cultivate different technical talents and formulate different educational systems and teaching content according to their production and actual needs. For example, steel and machinery factories need courses such as mechanics of materials and mechanical parts, and the length of study will also be different.

　　Every task not only needs a correct policy but also needs a revolutionary attitude to implement the policy. The Party Committee of the Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Factory, in leading the establishment of workers' spare-time technical schools, displayed a revolutionary spirit and made a series of reforms and innovations to the old educational system. In the past, culture was learned first and then technology, now cultural and technical knowledge are learned together; the past curriculum advanced in a spiral pattern, now it is a six-year continuous system, the curriculum rises directly, and a large number of repetitive parts in the old curriculum have been deleted; in the past, there were two semesters per academic year, now there are three semesters per academic year; without ready-made textbooks, they compiled their own; without teachers assigned by higher authorities, they went to find veteran workers and technicians. It is particularly worth pointing out that this school pays attention to combining the actual situation of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction to carry out Marxist-Leninist political education and ideological education to improve workers' ideological and political awareness. Now that the school has been established, judging from the educational system and curriculum, not only has it deleted unnecessary and repetitive courses in the old educational system, but it has also added necessary content such as political classes; the talents cultivated in this way will not only be able to serve the urgent needs of production, but also be cultured laborers with a high degree of political awareness.

　　By bringing into play this revolutionary and original style to implement the Party's policies and guidelines, a great leap forward situation has emerged vigorously. So it is with workers' spare-time education, and so it is with all work.

　　发扬革命的独创风格
　　张风
    上海国棉十七厂一所新型的业余纺织专科学校开学了，这是上海职工业余教育大跃进的一个标志。这个学校从本厂技术革命的迫切需要和职工具有丰富的生产实践知识的特点出发，根据政治、文化、技术相结合的教学原则，订定了新的学制，争取在六年左右使全厂青壮年职工全部达到高等纺织技术专科学校毕业的水平，即使文盲也不例外。
    六年左右就能使一个文盲达到高等技术专科学校毕业的水平，这在过去是不能想像的。国棉十七厂提出这个宏伟计划时，也展开了先进和保守思想的斗争。怀疑论者和反对派，认为必须墨守陈规；而工人用自己已经具有丰富的政治斗争经验和生产知识来说明，用自己学习文化的高度热情来说明，他们必须打破常规。后者的意见终于取得了胜利。这是职工业余教育贯彻面向实际、面向生产的方针的胜利，是职工业余教育中的一项革命措施，也是职工业余教育发展的方向。
    马克思列宁主义者一向认为：上层建筑应该为它的经济基础服务，促进生产的发展。作为上层建筑一部分的教育事业，自然也需要执行面向生产、面向实际的方针。但是，生产也好，实际也好，它们不是空洞的概念。各厂有它不同的生产需要，有它不同的实际。职工业余教育要正确地贯彻面向生产、面向实际的方针，就要从各厂不同的生产需要和实际条件出发来制定不同的学制和教学内容。上海国棉十七厂职工业余技术专科学校根据本厂宏伟的技术革命规划的迫切需要，为自己制定了明确的目标——培养纺织工业的技术队伍。因此，在课程上进行了大胆的增删。这是十分必要的措施。各种工厂都可以根据它的生产和实际的需要，培养不同的技术人材，制定不同的学制和教学内容。如钢铁、机械工厂就需要有材料力学、机械零件等课程，学习年限也就不一样。
    每一项工作，不仅要有正确的方针，也需要有贯彻方针的革命的态度。中共上海国棉十七厂党委，在领导办职工业余技术专科学校中，发挥了革命的精神，对旧学制进行了一系列的改革和独创。过去是先学文化再学技术，现在是文化、技术知识一起学；过去的课程是螺旋型的前进，现在是六年一贯制，课程直接上升，删去了旧课程中大量的重复部分；过去每学年两学期，现在每学年三学期；没有现成的教材，自己动手编；没有上级分配来的教师，到老工人和技术人员中去找。特别值得指出的是，这个学校注意结合我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实际，进行马克思列宁主义的政治教育和思想教育，来提高工人的思想政治觉悟。现在，学校办起来了，从学制、课程来看，不但删去了旧学制中不必要的和重复的课，也增加了必要的政治课等内容；由此培养出来的人材，将是既能为生产迫切需要服务，又是具有高度政治觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
  发挥这种革命的独创的风格来贯彻党的政策方针，大跃进的局面就轰轰烈烈地出现了。职工业余教育如此，一切工作也都如此。
