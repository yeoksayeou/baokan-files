Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th: The National Union of the Egyptian Region of the United Arab Republic's nineteen executive committees telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 16th, protesting the Hussein regime of Jordan's sentencing of thirteen Jordanians to death on the grounds of so-called conspiracy to overthrow the current Jordanian regime.

In the telegram, these committees called on Hammarskjöld to intervene in this matter to stop the execution of these sentences which severely violate human rights. They also demanded that the United Nations take swift measures to stop such violations of personal freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th: Residents of all cities and towns in the Syrian Region of the United Arab Republic are incredibly angered by the brutal acts of the Hussein regime of Jordan in sentencing Jordanian patriots to death on fabricated charges. A tide of protest has been set off throughout the region. Many groups and individuals have sent numerous telegrams to UN organizations and heads of Arab states, demanding the swift cessation of Hussein's brutality.

The Damascus Arab Writers Association and residents of various districts of Damascus have also sent numerous telegrams to the UN Secretary-General and heads of Arab states, calling for the cessation of the Jordanian authorities' brutal acts and demanding that the Jordanian authorities release all arrested Jordanian patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 16th: The Standing Committee of the Arab Lawyers Association sent telegrams this morning to the President of the UN General Assembly, the UN Secretary-General, the UN Commission on Human Rights, and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, protesting the Jordanian authorities' sentencing of thirteen innocent Jordanians to death.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: According to TASS, New York, 16th: "New York Times" reporter Phillips reported from the United Nations on a conversation with Toukan, the former Jordanian representative to the United Nations, who resigned this week to protest the policies of the Jordanian government.

Toukan spoke about the statement by Jordanian representative Rifai, who is currently attending the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly, regarding Jordan's disagreement with replacing British troops with UN troops. Toukan said that he completely disagreed with this policy and hoped that Jordan could get rid of all foreign troops as soon as possible. Toukan said that Rifai's remarks at the General Assembly expanded rather than reduced the tensions in Jordan and the entire Middle East region, and made the crisis increasingly complicated.

Toukan also said that Jordan's accusations against the United Arab Republic were without any basis. Jordan's problems are more internal than external in nature.

　　前约旦驻联合国代表抨击约旦代表在联大的声明
    新华社开罗17日电　阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区民族联盟所有十九个执行委员会16日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，抗议约旦侯赛因政权以所谓阴谋推翻约旦现政权的罪名判处十三名约旦人死刑。
    这些委员会在电报中呼吁哈马舍尔德干预这件事，以制止这些严重违反人权的判决的执行。它们还要求联合国迅速采取措施来制止这种侵犯人身自由的行为。
    新华社大马士革16日电　阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区所有城乡的居民对约旦侯赛因政权以捏造的罪名判处约旦爱国者死刑的残暴行为感到无比的愤怒。一个抗议的怒潮已经在全区掀起。很多团体和个人打了许多电报给联合国机构和阿拉伯国家的首脑，要求迅速制止侯赛因的残暴行为。
    大马士革阿拉伯作家协会和大马士革各区的居民也打了许多电报给联合国秘书长和阿拉伯国家的首脑，呼吁制止约旦当局的残暴行为，并且要求约旦当局释放所有被逮捕的约旦爱国人士。
    新华社巴格达16日电　阿拉伯律师协会常务委员会今天上午向联合国大会主席、联合国秘书长、联合国人权委员会和国际民主律师协会分别发出电报，抗议约旦当局把十三名无辜的约旦人判处死刑。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：“纽约时报”记者菲利普斯从联合国报道了前约旦驻联合国代表图康对他的谈话，图康是在本周为了表示抗议约旦政府的政策而辞职的。
    图康谈到了现在出席联合国大会紧急特别会议的约旦代表里法伊关于约旦不同意把英国军队换成联合国军队的声明。图康说，他根本不同意这种政策，并且希望约旦能够尽快地摆脱一切外国军队。图康说，里法伊在大会上的言论扩大了而不是减少了约旦和整个中东地区的紧张局势，并且使危机越来越复杂。
    图康还说，约旦对阿拉伯联合共和国的控诉是没有任何根据的。约旦的问题与其说具有外部性质，倒不如说具有内部性质。
