Use Your Brain and Your Hands; Be Able to Teach and Able to Do
Tianjin's Universities and Colleges Teachers Set Off a Work-Study Craze

(Our newspaper Tianjin, August 24th) Teachers in Tianjin's six universities and colleges are actively participating in work-study programs, using both their brains and their hands. This has opened up a new path for closely integrating teaching and scientific research with practice, and for teachers to become both red and expert.

After Tianjin's universities and colleges launched work-study programs, many teachers actively joined the effort, establishing factories and farms together with students. Recently, Chairman Mao inspected Tianjin University and Nankai University, proposing that teachers should also engage in work-study programs. This greatly encouraged teachers to participate in work-study activities. Currently, with the exception of those who are old and frail and unable to participate in labor, the majority of teachers have joined work-study programs.

The factories and farms run by teachers are mostly established together with students. For example, out of the 171 projects run by Tianjin University, 83 are jointly run with students. A small number are run solely by teachers. Teachers participate in work-study programs in a wide range of fields, from heavy industry, machinery manufacturing, and chemicals to light industry, handicrafts, and agriculture. Generally, teachers in science and engineering departments run specialized factories in conjunction with their professional scientific research and teaching tasks.

After teachers participated in work-study activities, the phenomenon of teachers and scientific research being divorced from practice began to change, promoting teaching reform and accelerating the speed of scientific research. Meng Guangzhe, a professor in the Second Mechanical Engineering Department of Tianjin University, had been working on scientific research on welding identification for over a year without success. This time, he and his students produced welding rods and trial-produced new products in their self-run factory, and in conjunction with product identification, completed this scientific research in about a month. After teachers and students in the Chemistry Department of Nankai University established a factory, they proposed nearly 1,500 scientific research projects.

After many teachers participated in labor, their ideological feelings began to change. People who had never had the habit of labor in the past began to develop the habit of labor and cherished their labor results. Yu Yixuan, the director of the Vocal Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music and a famous singer, began to dig and carry soil every day after participating in the labor of the "Red Light Farm" jointly opened by the teachers of the department. Seeing the soil nurture the little cabbages she planted with her own hands, she developed a deep feeling for the soil and began to develop the habit of physical labor.

Many teachers received enthusiastic help from factory workers in running factories, and through frequent contact with the workers, they recognized the fine qualities of the working class. When the teachers of the History Department of Tianjin Normal University went to relevant factories to negotiate the establishment of a fiberglass factory, they were deeply moved to see many workers creating many precision products needed for national construction in factories with rudimentary equipment. They felt that they were in a good building at the school, with such good conditions, and the state had entrusted the task of training talents to the teachers, but the people they trained were "rejects." They deeply felt sorry for the working people.

Teachers participating in work-study activities and working with students increased mutual contact and further strengthened the relationship between teachers and students. Jiang Dingxian, director of the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, had a relatively deep understanding in this regard. He said that in the past, I mostly contacted students during class, and there was not much contact outside of class. After participating in the red commune printing factory established by the department, I often worked with the students. During breaks, the students talked to me, talked about life, and talked about thoughts. They talked and laughed. When the first batch of products was successfully manufactured in the factory, regardless of teachers and students, everyone cheered for the birth of the fruits of common labor. Teachers and students established a close friendship in common labor.

### 动脑动手　能教能做  天津高等学校教师掀起勤工俭学热潮

　　动脑动手　能教能做
    天津高等学校教师掀起勤工俭学热潮
    本报天津24日电　天津市六所高等学校的教师积极参加勤工俭学活动，既动脑又动手，为教学和科学研究密切结合实际以及教师又红又专找到了一条新的途径。
    天津市各高等学校展开勤工俭学活动以后，许多教师就积极投入这一活动，和学生一起举办工厂、农场。最近毛主席视察了天津大学和南开大学，提出教师也要搞勤工俭学的指示以后，更大大鼓舞了教师参加勤工俭学的热情。目前，除年老体衰不能参加劳动的以外，大部分教师都参加了勤工俭学的活动。
    教师们举办的工厂、农场大部分都是和学生们一起搞起来的。例如天津大学举办的一百七十一个项目中，有八十三个是和学生合办的。少数是教师单独举办的。教师们参加勤工俭学的范围很广泛，从重工业、机械制造、化工到轻工业、手工业、农场等。一般理工科的教师，大部分是结合专业的科学研究和教学任务举办专业性的工厂。
    教师们参加勤工俭学活动以后，开始改变了教师和科学研究脱离实际的现象，推动了教学改革、加快了科学研究的速度。天津大学第二机械系教授孟广哲，过去搞焊接鉴定的科学研究，一年多也没搞成，这次，他和学生们一起在自办的工厂生产焊条和试制新产品，并结合产品的鉴定，在一个月左右的时间完成了这项科学研究。南开大学化学系教师和学生在办工厂以后，提出了近一千五百个科学研究项目。
    许多教师参加劳动以后，思想感情开始发生了变化。过去从来没有劳动习惯的人，开始养成了劳动习惯，并珍视自己的劳动成果。中央音乐学院声乐系主任、著名的歌唱家喻宜萱从参加了系里老师们共同开辟的“红光农场”的劳动以后，成天挖土、抬土；看见泥土把自己亲手栽的小白菜哺育成长，对泥土产生了深厚的感情，开始养成体力劳动的习惯。
    许多教师在办工厂中得到工厂工人们的热情帮助，由于和工人们经常接触，认识到工人阶级的优良品质。天津师范大学历史系教师们为了创办玻璃钢厂，去有关的工厂接洽时，看到许多工人在设备简陋的厂房里，创造出许多国家建设所需要的精密产品，十分感动。他们感到自己在学校的大楼里，条件这样好，国家把培养人材的任务交给教师，但培养出来的人却是“废品”，深深感到对不起劳动人民。
    教师参加勤工俭学活动，与学生们一起劳动，增加了相互间的接触，进一步密切了师生的关系。中央音乐学院作曲系主任江定仙在这方面有比较深刻的体会。他说，过去我和学生多半在上课时接触，课外联系不多。参加了系里创办的红色公社印刷厂以后，经常和学生们一起劳动，休息的时候，学生们和我谈话，谈生活，谈思想，有说有笑。在工厂里第一批产品制造成功的时候，不分教师和学生，大家都为共同劳动的果实诞生而欢呼。师生间在共同劳动中建立了亲切的友谊。
