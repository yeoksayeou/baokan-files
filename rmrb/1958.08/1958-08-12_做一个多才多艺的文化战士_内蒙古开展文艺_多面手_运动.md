Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 11th: The "All-Rounder" Arts Movement has been launched in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　The Xilin Gol League Cultural Troupe, active on the Xilin Gol Grasslands, is composed of Mongolian and Han men and women who can all act in plays, sing, dance, and create. This cultural troupe performs thirty to forty programs in a single evening. Nearly a hundred characters appear on stage, making it seem like a large-scale theater troupe, but backstage, there are only twenty or so people working. They cooperate closely, regardless of their roles, working together on lighting, scenery, the band, and performances. One actor often takes on several roles, participating in the performance of several programs.

　　In recent years, the majority of the plays, poems, and dances that this cultural troupe has performed on tour on the grasslands were discovered and created by the team members who went deep into the yurts and lived and worked with the herdsmen. The "Milkmaid" dance, which has won praise from audiences at home and abroad, was created by this team.

　　The Zhaowuda League Cultural Troupe, which is currently carrying out mass cultural activities in the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of southeastern Inner Mongolia, has also recently put forward the slogan "Let every team member become a versatile person," requiring team members to be able to perform plays and dances for farmers and herdsmen, and also to play several musical instruments, according to work needs and individual conditions. All team members are working hard day and night to practice, striving to establish a thirty-person orchestra before the end of the year.

　　The Baotou City Cultural Troupe has been increasing its performances in factories and rural areas, while also launching a mass creation movement. Now, the cultural troupe has basically achieved that everyone writes and everyone composes. In the past month or so, they have created seven dances, more than forty songs, and more than ten performing materials and living newspaper plays, which have been well received by the audience in the street performances publicizing the general line and protesting against the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East.

### 做一个多才多艺的文化战士　内蒙古开展文艺“多面手”运动

　　做一个多才多艺的文化战士
　　内蒙古开展文艺“多面手”运动
    新华社呼和浩特11日电　“文艺多面手”运动已在内蒙古自治区展开。
    活跃在锡林郭勒大草原上的锡林郭勒盟文化队，全队蒙古族和汉族男女队员，人人会演剧，会歌唱，会舞蹈，会创作。这支文化队一夜演出三、四十个节目，台上有近百个角色进进出出，很像是一个规模很大的剧团，可是到后台一看，却只有二十来个人在工作。他们不分彼此，亲密合作，一起搞灯光、布景、乐队和演出。一个演员经常担任几种角色，参加几个节目的演出。
    近年来，这支文化队在草原上巡回演出的大批剧目、诗歌、舞蹈，绝大部分是队员们深入蒙古包，同牧民一道生活劳动中发掘和创作出来的。曾获得国内外观众赞赏的“挤奶员”舞，就是这个队创作的。
    正在内蒙古东南部半农半牧区开展群众文化活动的昭乌达盟文化队，最近也提出“让每一个队员成为多才多艺的人”的口号，要求队员根据工作需要和个人条件，做到不仅能给农牧民演剧、舞蹈，又能演奏几种乐器。全体队员正在起早贪黑地加紧练习，争取年底以前建立一支三十人组成的管弦乐队。
    包头市文工团一面增加去工厂、农村演出的活动，一面开展了群众性的创作运动。现在，这个文工团基本上做到了人人动笔、人人编写，最近一个多月来已创作出舞蹈七个、歌曲四十多首、演唱材料和活报剧十多个，在宣传总路线、抗议美英侵略中东的街头演出中，受到广大观众的好评。
