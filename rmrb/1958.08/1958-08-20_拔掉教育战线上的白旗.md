    Pull Out the White Flags on the Education Front
　　Commentator of this Newspaper

    Should China's education事业 follow the socialist path or the capitalist path? Should it follow the expert route or the mass line? This is an acute and serious struggle. From the recent great debate on educational policy and the struggle to pull out white flags at Wuhan University, this can be seen even more clearly.

    In the struggle to pull out white flags, Wuhan University focused on criticizing a complete set of bourgeois educational ideas of many experts inside and outside the Party, represented by Qi Minyou, a member of the Party Committee and Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Mathematics Department. These experts with bourgeois educational ideas believed that mathematics is an abstract science with its own special path of development and should not be linked to practice. Some professors even openly stated that linking the Mathematics Department to production and practice would destroy mathematics, not develop it. Therefore, they summarized the path of mathematical development as only practice – theory – theory, or theory – theory – theory, falling into subjective idealism and unable to extricate themselves. They believed that the Party's socialist education policy was not applicable to the Mathematics Department, and the Party could not lead the Mathematics Department or interfere with it. Under the leadership of the Wuhan University Party organization, with politics in command, a struggle between two paths was launched. The more the truth was debated, the clearer it became, the masses' awareness was raised, and their minds were liberated. Finally, the bourgeois white flag on the education front was pulled out, the proletarian red flag was planted, the Party's education policy was implemented in the Mathematics Department, and a new atmosphere of socialist great leap forward emerged.

    What does this fierce struggle in the Mathematics Department of Wuhan University illustrate?

    This struggle shows that we must resolutely overcome right-leaning ideas, implement the Party's socialist education policy, make education serve politics, combine education with productive labor, boldly mobilize the masses, launch a struggle between two paths, pull out white flags, and plant red flags. The implementation of the Party's socialist education policy will inevitably encounter resistance and opposition from bourgeois intellectuals. This is not only an ideological struggle but also a class struggle; this struggle will inevitably be reflected within the Party. The struggle to pull out white flags at Wuhan University fully illustrates this point. Qi Minyou was the representative of the bourgeois white flag within the Party. He held high the white flag to oppose the Party's policy. Although this is an extreme minority, there are still many Party experts who do not consciously implement the Party's policy but superficially implement it while inwardly disagreeing. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely overcome right-leaning ideas within the Party and fully展开争辩. This is a serious political task. Faced with the situation in the Mathematics Department, the Wuhan University Party organization held high the red flag, first within the Party and then outside the Party, launching a mass debate and unfolding a principled struggle, which was absolutely necessary. Facts show that doing so not only educated the entire Party but also educated all teachers and students in the school. Everyone's awareness was raised, their eyes were brightened, and they resolutely implemented the central government's policy, thus creating an unprecedented new atmosphere throughout the school.

    This struggle also shows that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over teaching, eradicate the old roots of bourgeois ideology, resolutely follow the mass line, and oppose the expert route. If the proletariat does not occupy the ideological front, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. There is no and cannot be a vacuum. Therefore, in compiling teaching syllabuses and selecting teaching materials, schools must follow the mass line, absorb the participation of the broad masses of teachers and students, mobilize the wisdom and strength of the masses, and carry out a revolution, not adopt a reformist approach. Every course must plant a red flag, both in the liberal arts and in the science and engineering departments. Only in this way can we cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and can we thoroughly complete the teaching revolution.

    This struggle also illustrates a universal truth: the Party Central Committee's policy is suitable for any education department and any specific education unit, and it is wrong for any department or unit to emphasize its own special conditions and fail to earnestly implement the Party's policy. Mathematics has always been considered the most abstract discipline. However, the history of mathematical development shows that the source of mathematical theory is practice. It can be widely linked to practice and serve production, and it can play a role in the current development of production. All mathematical theories are also summarized from practice, whether from direct or indirect practice, they must return to practice. Mathematics can only be developed by linking it to production and practice; otherwise, it is truly destroying mathematics. Not only is mathematics like this, but all other sciences are also like this. Therefore, every aspect of school education must implement the socialist education policy of combining education with production.

    The victory of the struggle between the two paths in the Mathematics Department of Wuhan University is a victory for the Party's socialist education policy. However, it also shows that this struggle is acute, complex, and long-term. All colleges and universities must boldly mobilize the masses, pull out white flags, plant red flags, launch a struggle between two paths, ensure the effective implementation of the socialist education policy, and cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

    拔掉教育战线上的白旗
　　本报评论员
    我国教育事业要走社会主义的路线，还是走资本主义的路线？走专家路线，还是走群众路线？这是一场尖锐的严重斗争。从武汉大学最近开展的教育方针大辩论、拔白旗的斗争中，更可以清楚地看出来。
    武汉大学在拔白旗的斗争中，集中批判了以党委委员、数学系党总支书记齐民友为代表的党内外不少专家一套完整的资产阶级教育思想。这些具有资产阶级教育思想的专家，认为数学是一门抽象科学，有它自己的特殊发展道路，不能联系实际。有的教授甚至公开讲，数学系也要联系生产、联系实际是毁灭数学，不是发展数学。因之，他们归纳数学发展的道路，只能是实践——理论——理论，或者是理论——理论——理论，陷入主观唯心主义而不能自拔。他们认为，党的社会主义教育方针在数学系不适用，党不能领导数学系，也无权过问。在武汉大学党组织的领导下，政治挂帅，展开了两条道路的斗争，真理愈辩愈明，群众觉悟提高，思想解放，终于拔掉了教育战线上资产阶级的白旗，插上了无产阶级的红旗，在数学系贯彻了党的教育方针，出现了社会主义大跃进的新气象。
    武汉大学数学系这一场激烈斗争，说明了什么问题呢？
    这个斗争说明了，必须坚决克服右倾思想，贯彻党的社会主义办学方针，使教育为政治服务，教育同生产劳动结合，放手发动群众，展开两条道路斗争，拔掉白旗，插上红旗。党的社会主义教育方针的贯彻，必然会遇到资产阶级知识分子的抗拒和抵触，这不仅是思想斗争，也是阶级斗争；这个斗争必然会反映到党内来。武汉大学的拔白旗的斗争就充分说明了这一点。齐民友就是资产阶级的白旗在党内的代表。他高举白旗，与党的方针相对抗。这虽然是极少数，但是还有不少党内专家，不是自觉地执行党的方针，表面执行，内心不以为然。因此，必须在党内坚决克服右倾思想，充分展开争辩，这是一项严重的政治任务。武汉大学党组织面对数学系这种情况，高举红旗，先党内后党外，发动群众大辩论，展开原则斗争，是完全必要的。事实说明，这样做，不仅教育了全党，也教育了全校师生。大家觉悟提高了，眼睛亮了，坚决贯彻中央的方针，从而使全校出现了从来未有的新气象。
    这个斗争也说明了，必须加强党对教学的领导，把资产阶级思想的老根子挖掉，坚决走群众路线，反对专家路线。思想阵地无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级必然去占领，没有也不可能有真空地带。因此，学校在编写教学大纲、选择教材内容等方面，必须走群众路线，吸收广大师生参加，动员群众的智慧和力量，来一个革命，不能采取改良主义办法。门门课程要插红旗，在文法科系如此，在理工科系也是如此。只有这样，才能培养出有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，才能彻底地完成教学革命。
    这个斗争也说明了一个普遍真理：党中央方针适合任何教育部门以及任何具体教育单位，任何部门或单位强调自己的特殊条件，而不认真贯彻党的方针是错误的。数学系向来被人们认为是最抽象的一门学科。但是，数学发展的历史说明，数学理论的来源是实践。它是能够广泛地联系实际，并为生产服务的，能够对当前的生产的发展发生作用。所有数学的理论也都是从实践中总结出来的，不论来自直接实践和间接实践，都要回到实际中去。数学只有联系生产、联系实际，才能得到发展，否则，那才是真正毁灭数学。不仅数学是这样，其它一切科学也是这样。因此，学校教育的任何方面必须贯彻教育结合生产的社会主义教育方针。
    武汉大学数学系两条道路斗争的胜利，是党的社会主义教育方针的胜利。但是，它也说明这个斗争是尖锐的，复杂的，而且又是长期的斗争。所有高等学校必须放手发动群众，拔白旗，插红旗，展开两条道路的斗争，保证社会主义的教育方针切实贯彻，培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
