Xinhua News Agency, August 17th, TASS New York, August 17th: Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session, held a banquet on the 16th. The following were invited to the banquet: United Arab Republic Foreign Minister Fawzi, Belarusian Foreign Minister Kiselev, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov, Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamal, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Palamarchuk.

Also present at the banquet were Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin and the following Permanent Representatives to the United Nations: Afghanistan - Pazhwak, Indonesia - Sastroamidjojo, Soviet Union - Sobolev.

During the banquet, friendly conversations were held on some issues at the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th, New York Dispatch: Following a series of intense meetings between US Secretary of State Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd with Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Engen and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold, a proposal put forward by Norway is taking shape. Sources say the proposal may be submitted to the General Assembly on the 18th.

Engen declined to disclose the content of the Norwegian proposal, but Western news agencies widely reported that the proposal contains the key points of the plan put forward by Eisenhower and Lloyd in their speeches to the General Assembly to deal with the Middle East issue according to US and UK conditions. There are also reports that the Norwegian proposal is based on the original Japanese proposal to the Security Council, which includes the two clauses insisted upon by Hammarskjold: studying the possibility of establishing a United Nations police force and establishing an economic organization to "develop" the Middle East. Therefore, Western news agencies report that the Norwegian proposal is actually a Norwegian version of the US plan.

Despite the obvious signs that the Norwegian proposal was jointly concocted by the United States and Britain, it is said that the United States and Britain will not participate in "initiating" the proposal. Associated Press reported that the United States and Britain support the Norwegian plan but are not expected to initiate it.

At the same time, Dulles is also instigating Japan to draft a proposal that can reflect the will of the United States in order to win the support of the United Nations majority. The United Nations General Assembly has been held for five days from the 13th to today, and the US and British aggressors have not been able to put forward a proposal of their own, which fully reflects the isolation and difficulties of the two aggressors in the General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi instructed Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, who is attending the Emergency Session of the United Nations General Assembly, by telephone on the evening of the 15th, to draft a "Japanese proposal" so that, in a situation where Eisenhower's six-point plan is facing opposition everywhere, the American poison can be put into a bottle labeled with a "Japanese proposal."

According to Kyodo News, Kishi instructed that the main content of the "Japanese proposal" include Eisenhower's proposals to establish a United Nations police force in the Middle East and to provide so-called "economic assistance" to the Middle East.

Kishi asked Fujiyama to draft the "Japanese proposal" after hearing Fujiyama's report on the content of his meeting with US Secretary of State Dulles that day. Kyodo News said that Dulles and Fujiyama suggested during their meeting: "It is hoped that Japan will play a core role and draft a proposal that can be approved by a majority of countries in the United Nations." Fujiyama immediately expressed to Dulles that he would draft a Japanese proposal to "create conditions" for the withdrawal of US and British troops and submit it to the United Nations General Assembly.

Fujiyama's activities at the United Nations in the past two days are noteworthy. He met with Dulles, Yugoslav Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Popovic, Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna, and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold on the 15th and 16th. After the meeting between Fujiyama and Hammarskjold, according to Fujiyama's spokesman: "They discussed the situation here, assessed the situation so far, and discussed the issues that still need to be considered carefully." Some other Japanese officials said that Fujiyama hopes to learn more details about Hammarskjold's views on the efforts currently being made to seek a "compromise." It is revealed that this so-called "compromise" plan is essentially the same as Eisenhower's plan, using "the United Nations can be responsible for the independence of Jordan and Lebanon" as a cover to "legitimize" the aggressive acts of the US and British imperialists against these two countries.

　　葛罗米柯宴阿联等国代表
　　美英策划挪日提出适合美国条件的提案
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社纽约17日讯：参加联合国大会紧急特别会议的苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯16日举行了宴会，应邀出席宴会的有：阿联外交部长法齐，白俄罗斯外交部长基谢廖夫，保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫，伊拉克外交部长贾迈尔，波兰外交部长腊帕茨基，捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维，乌克兰外交部长帕拉马尔楚克。
    出席宴会的还有苏联外交部副部长佐林和下列各国驻联合国常驻代表：阿富汗——佩吉瓦克，印度尼西亚——沙斯特罗阿米佐约，苏联——索波列夫。
    宴会中就联合国大会紧急特别会议上的一些问题进行了友好的交谈。
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：在美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国外交大臣劳埃德同挪威副外交大臣恩根和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德举行一连串紧张会谈后，一项由挪威出面的提案正在形成。有消息说，这个提案可能在18日向大会提出。
    恩根拒绝透露挪威提案的内容，但是，西方通讯社广泛透露，这个提案包含有艾森豪威尔和劳埃德在大会上发言时提出的按照美英的条件来处理中东问题的计划的要点。还有消息说，挪威提案是以原先日本向安理会提出的提案作基础的，它包括哈马舍尔德坚持的两条款项：研究建立一支联合国警察部队的可能性和成立一个“开发”中东的经济组织。因此，西方通讯社消息说，挪威提案实际上是美国计划的挪威版。
    尽管挪威的提案有着明显的美英联合泡制的迹象，据说美、英两国将不参与“发起”这项提案。美联社消息说，美、英两国支持挪威的计划，但是预料不会发起这个计划。
    与此同时，杜勒斯还在策动日本拟出一个能够反映美国意志的提案，以便争取联合国多数通过。联合国大会从13日举行到今天已经五天，美英侵略者还不能够提出一项它们自己的提案，这充分反映了两个侵略者在大会上的孤立和困难。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介15日晚上用电话指示出席联合国大会紧急会议的外务相藤山爱一郎，要他拟订一个“日本提案”，以便在艾森豪威尔的六点计划到处遭到反对的情况下，用“日本提案”的瓶子装上美国的毒酒。
    据共同社报道，岸信介指示拟订“日本提案”的主要内容包括艾森豪威尔提出的在中东建立联合国警察部队和对中东进行所谓“经济援助”等建议。
    岸信介要藤山拟定“日本提案”是在听到藤山报告了当天他同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈的内容后提出的。共同社说，杜勒斯和藤山会谈时曾经建议：“希望日本起核心的作用，拟出一个能够得到联合国多数国家赞成的提案来”。藤山当即向杜勒斯表示要草拟一个为美英撤军“创造条件”的日本提案，向联合国大会提出。
    这两天里，藤山在联合国的活动很值得注意。他在15日和16日先后会见了杜勒斯、南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长波波维奇、阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳以及联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德等人。在藤山和哈马舍尔德会谈之后，据藤山的发言人说：“他们讨论了这里的情况，对于到目前为止的局势进行了估价，并且讨论了仍然需要费力考虑的问题。”另外一些日本官员说，藤山希望更详细地了解哈马舍尔德对于目前为求得一个“折衷方案”所作的努力的意见。据透露，这个所谓“折衷”方案，实质上依然是像艾森豪威尔的计划一样，用“联合国可以对约旦和黎巴嫩的独立负责”作外衣，使美英帝国主义者对这两个国家的侵略行为“合法化”。
