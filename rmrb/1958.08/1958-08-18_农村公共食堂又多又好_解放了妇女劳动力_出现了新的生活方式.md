(Reported by this newspaper) The broad masses of peasants in rural areas are vigorously establishing peasant canteens and running nurseries, laundry groups, and sewing groups on a large scale. They are also actively promoting the semi-mechanization of flour milling and grain processing, which is further liberating the women's labor force, which accounts for half of the country's population. At the same time, the appearance of rural production and farmers' lives is also undergoing tremendous changes.

According to statistics from the past few days, Henan Province has established more than 310,000 public canteens, with participation by 71% of the province's total population. Liaoning Province has established more than 18,000 rural public canteens, more than 11,000 sewing factories (groups), and more than 71,000 nurseries. In Qinghai Province, all of the more than 240,000 farm households in agricultural areas have joined public canteens, and nurseries have been opened everywhere in rural areas. In addition, in Xinjiang, Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Anhui, and other places, whether in plains or mountainous areas, public canteens, nurseries, sewing organizations, etc., have been established in large numbers.

The establishment of rural public canteens, nurseries, and other collective welfare undertakings, thanks to the earnest implementation by various localities of the policy of actively organizing life according to the needs of production development, has achieved remarkable results in guiding women to participate in production. Heilongjiang Province has established more than 50,000 nurseries, enabling more than 225,000 women to participate in summer hoeing production. In the Yuci Special District of Shanxi, because 90% of young children have entered nurseries, more than 344,000 women have been freed from the kitchen and mill. In the Xinxiang Special District of Henan, the establishment of public canteens alone has freed up 800,000 women's labor force. In Dali County, Shaanxi, there are 26,200 women with children aged one to seven, of whom 25,000 have to cook, sew, and grind flour, and cannot often participate in production or cannot participate in production at all. Now, the county has established nurseries and public canteens, and has realized mechanized sewing and mechanized grain processing, which has enabled 25,000 women to devote themselves to year-round production. The large-scale participation of women in the production ranks has alleviated the current situation of labor shortage to a considerable extent.

Because women can participate in production without any worries, a situation of "three satisfactions" has emerged in some places: that is, cooperatives are satisfied because of regular attendance, high labor efficiency, and better completion of production tasks; members are satisfied because the labor force is supplemented, the labor intensity is reduced, and the labor time is shortened; the whole family is satisfied because of increased family income and protection of children's health. Therefore, wherever the above-mentioned social welfare undertakings have been carried out, a new situation of high production enthusiasm, family harmony, neighborhood unity, and enthusiastic learning of technology and culture has emerged.

The welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries run by various localities have been developing extremely smoothly because they have truly enlightened the masses to be conscious, relied on the masses to run and manage themselves, implemented the spirit of making use of simple things and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and paid attention to adapting to the different needs of the masses. For example, after the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Huangyuan County in early July, many areas established a series of living welfare institutions within two or three days. In Ningqiang County, Shaanxi, nurseries, public canteens, and maternity hospitals were established everywhere in the county in five days. In Anyi County, Shanxi, nurseries and kindergartens were universally established in ten days. Because all localities have truly pooled their efforts and cooperated with each other, these welfare undertakings have been carried out economically and well. The masses in Mitu County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, gave up the landlord's tile houses they had been allocated to use as public canteens, and lent their iron pots and steamers to the canteen for public use. The cooperative did not need to spend any money to set up the canteen. The masses in Xunhua County, Qinghai, established eleven maternity hospitals themselves, and the state and agricultural cooperatives did not spend a penny. There are countless examples of many areas saving grain and avoiding waste because of the establishment of public canteens. (Attached picture)

### 农村公共食堂又多又好  解放了妇女劳动力　出现了新的生活方式

    农村公共食堂又多又好
    解放了妇女劳动力　出现了新的生活方式
    本报讯　广大农村群众大办农民食堂，大办托儿所、洗衣组、缝纫组，并积极促进磨面和粮食加工实现半机械化，正使占全国人口半数的妇女劳动力进一步获得解放，同时使农村生产和农民生活面貌也随着发生了巨大的变化。
    据最近几天的统计，河南省已建立公共食堂三十一万多个，参加的群众占全省总人口的71％。辽宁省已办起农村公共食堂一万八千多个，缝纫厂（组）一万一千多个，托儿所七万一千多个。青海省农业区二十四万多个农户，全部参加了公共食堂，整个农村到处办开了托儿所。此外，像新疆、广西、广东、云南、贵州、福建、安徽等地，无论平原或山区，都大量办起了公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫等组织。
    开办农村公共食堂、托儿所等集体生活福利事业，由于各地认真贯彻了根据生产发展的需要，积极地组织生活的方针，对引导妇女参加生产取得了显著的效果。黑龙江省建立了五万多个托儿所，使二十二万五千多个妇女参加了夏锄生产。山西榆次专区二十一个县，因为有90％的幼儿入了托儿所，便使三十四万四千多妇女走出厨房、磨房。河南新乡专区仅因办了公共食堂一项，就腾出了八十万妇女劳动力。陕西大荔县有一至七岁孩子的妇女共二万六千二百人，其中有二万五千人要做饭、缝衣、磨面，不能经常参加生产或根本不能参加生产。现在全县办起了托儿所、公共食堂，实现了缝纫机械化、粮食加工机械化，已使二万五千名妇女投入了常年生产。大量妇女参加进生产行列，就使当前劳力紧张的状况因而得到相当程度的缓和。
    由于妇女能毫无牵挂地参加生产，有些地方出现了“三满意”：这就是：出勤经常，劳动效率高，能更好地完成生产任务，合作社满意；劳动队伍得到补充，减轻了劳动强度，减少了劳动时间，社员满意；增加了家庭收入，保护了幼儿健康，全家满意。因此，凡是举办了上述社会福利事业的地方，便出现了生产情绪高涨，家庭和睦，邻里团结，热烈学习技术和文化的新局面。
    各地举办的公共食堂、托儿所等福利事业，由于真正作到了启发群众自觉、依靠群众自办自管；贯彻了因陋就简、勤俭办一切事业的精神，并且注意适应群众不同需要，工作开展极为顺利。例如青海省委7月上旬在湟源县召开了现场会议以后，许多地区都在两三天内办起了一系列的生活福利机构。陕西宁强县五天当中全县便到处办起了托儿所、公共食堂、产妇医院。山西安邑县十天普遍建立了托儿所、幼儿园。因为各地真正作到了群策群力，互助合作，所以这些福利事业办得又省又好。广西僮族自治区弥渡县群众，把自己分得的地主瓦房让出来作公共食堂，并且把自己的铁锅、甑子都拿出来借给食堂公用，合作社根本不需要花什么钱就把食堂搞起来了。青海循化县群众自己办了十一个产妇院，国家和农业社没有出一分钱。许多地区因为办起公共食堂而节约粮食、避免浪费的事实更是不胜列举。（附图片）
