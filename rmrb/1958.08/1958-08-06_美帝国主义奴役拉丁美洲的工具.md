Tools of U.S. Imperialism to Enslave Latin America

The "Organization of American States"

The "Organization of American States" is a tool organized by U.S. imperialism to control and enslave the people of Latin American countries. In 1890, under the beautiful slogans of Pan-American "cooperation" and "unity," the United States forced twenty Latin American countries to hold the First International Conference of American States in the United States, establishing a permanent institution. In 1910, the Fourth International Conference of American States renamed the institution the "Pan American Union." In April 1948, the Ninth International Conference of American States adopted the "Charter of the Organization of American States," and reorganized the "Pan American Union" into the "Organization of American States."

The member states of the "Organization of American States" are the United States, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Although the "Charter of the Organization of American States" makes the tasks of this organization sound very grand, the actual situation is quite the opposite. In 1945, the Inter-American Conference held in Mexico established the "Chapultepec Agreement," strengthening the "joint defense" of the American countries controlled by the United States. In September 1947, the United States forced the American countries to sign the "Rio de Janeiro Treaty," achieving U.S. military control over Latin America through "military cooperation." According to the provisions of this "treaty," the "Inter-American Defense Alliance" was established, and the leader of the alliance was a U.S. general. The "suggestions" of the alliance were binding on all Latin American countries, regardless of whether they agreed or not. In March 1951, the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the American States held in Washington adopted more than a dozen resolutions on military, police, and "economic cooperation." The Tenth Inter-American Conference held in Venezuela in March 1954 further adopted the notorious anti-communist proposal put forward by the United States. Under the banner of anti-communism, the United States openly interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. At that time, the democratic government of Guatemala was overthrown by the United States using this anti-communist resolution to carry out armed intervention. For many years, the United States has used this organization to suppress the national independence movements of the people of Latin American countries, and to carry out cruel plunder of the rich resources of Latin America, placing the people of Latin American countries in a tragic situation of powerlessness and poverty.

In recent years, due to the raging anti-American flames burning everywhere in Latin America, profound contradictions have also been developing within the "Organization of American States." Latin American countries have continuously resisted, causing this organization to pass some resolutions that conform to the interests of Latin American countries. For example, in 1953, the Inter-American Economic and Social Council passed a resolution urging the abolition of U.S. tariff barriers. In 1954, the Tenth Inter-American Conference held in Caracas, despite U.S. opposition, passed many resolutions related to the economic and political interests of Latin American countries, as well as a convention on exercising the right to political asylum on their own territory and a resolution on suggesting that the United States revise its "embargo" policy. The Pan-American Economic Conference held in Rio de Janeiro from November 22 to December 2, 1954, was actually a conference where Latin American countries united against the United States. At the meeting, Latin American countries successively raised the issue of stabilizing the prices of raw materials in Latin American countries and developing the economies of Latin American countries themselves. However, under the arrogance and pressure of U.S. imperialism, these problems were not resolved.

In addition, in addition to controlling the "Organization of American States," U.S. imperialism, in view of the upsurge of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements of the people of Central American countries, especially the Guatemalan people, in order to completely enslave the people of Central America and attempt to use the method of "Latin Americans fighting Latin Americans" to suppress the national independence movements in the Central American region, also established the "Organization of Central American States" under the "Organization of American States" on December 14, 1951. The member states of the "Organization of Central American States" are Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, but the actual control of this organization still lies with the United States. After the establishment of the organization, due to the resistance of the democratic government of Guatemala, and later Guatemala announced its withdrawal, the "Organization of Central American States" has never held a formal meeting of foreign ministers. It was not until after the democratic government of Guatemala was overthrown by the United States that a meeting was held in Guatemala on August 18, 1955. This meeting passed a resolution "condemning communism and other totalitarianism," immediately exposing the true face of the "Organization of Central American States" being used by the United States to carry out the dirty tricks of aggression and enslavement of member states.

### 美帝国主义奴役拉丁美洲的工具

    美帝国主义奴役拉丁美洲的工具
    “美洲国家组织”
    “美洲国家组织”是美帝国主义所组织的用以控制和奴役拉丁美洲各国人民的工具。1890年，美国在泛美“合作”“团结”等等漂亮的口号下，强使拉丁美洲二十个国家在美国举行了第一次美洲国家会议。成立了常设机构。1910年第四次美洲国家会议将该机构改称为
  “泛美联盟”。1948年4月第九次美洲国家会议通过“美洲国家组织宪章”，又把“泛美联盟”改组为“美洲国家组织”。
    “美洲国家组织”的成员国有美国、阿根廷、玻利维亚、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、古巴、多米尼加、厄瓜多尔、萨尔瓦多、危地马拉、海地、洪都拉斯、墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马、巴拉圭、秘鲁、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉。
    虽然在“美洲国家组织宪章”里把这个组织的任务说得很冠冕堂皇，但是，实际情况却恰恰与此相反。1945年在墨西哥举行的美洲国家会议，订立了“查普德庇克公约”，加强了由美国控制的美洲国家的“联防”。1947年9月美国又强使美洲国家订立了“里约热内卢公约”，实现了美国在军事上控制拉丁美洲的“军事合作”，根据这个“公约”的规定，建立了“泛美防御联盟”，而联盟的领导者是美国的将军，联盟的“建议”，对于拉丁美洲各国都有约束力，不管拉丁美洲国家同意与否。1951年3月在华盛顿召开的美洲国家外长会议，又通过了十几个关于军事、警察和“经济合作”的决议。1954年3月在委内瑞拉召开的第十届美洲国家会议，更进一步通过了美国提出的臭名远扬的反共提案，美国打着反共的旗帜，公然干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政，当时危地马拉的民主政府就是被美国利用这个反共决议进行武装干涉所推翻的。多少年来，美国一直利用这个组织镇压拉丁美洲国家人民的民族独立运动，对拉丁美洲的丰富资源进行残酷的掠夺，使拉丁美洲各国人民陷于无权和贫穷的悲惨境地。
    近几年来，由于拉丁美洲到处延烧着反美的熊熊烈火，“美洲国家组织”内部也日益发展着深刻的矛盾。拉丁美洲国家不断地进行反抗，使这个组织曾通过了一些符合拉丁美洲国家的若干利益的决议。如1953年召开的美洲国家经济社会理事会，通过了一项敦促取消美国关税壁垒的决议案。1954年在加拉加斯召开的第十届美洲国家会议，不顾美国的反对而通过了许多有关拉丁美洲各国的经济和政治利益的议案，以及关于在本国领土上行使政治庇护权的公约和一项关于建议美国修改它的“禁运”政策的决议。1954年11月22日到12月2日，在里约热内卢召开的泛美经济会议，实际上是拉丁美洲国家联合反对美国的会议，会上拉丁美洲国家纷纷提出稳定拉丁美洲国家原料价格问题，和发展拉丁美洲国家自己的经济问题。但是，在美帝国主义的专横和压力下，这些问题都没有得到解决。
    此外，美帝国主义除了控制“美洲国家组织”以外，鉴于中美洲国家人民，特别是危地马拉人民反帝反封建运动的高涨，为了彻底奴役中美洲人民，企图用“拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人”的手段来镇压中美洲地区的民族独立运动，又于1951年12月14日在“美洲国家组织”下成立了“中美洲国家组织”。“中美洲国家组织”的成员国有哥斯达黎加、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多和尼加拉瓜，而实际控制这个组织的仍然是美国。该组织成立后，由于危地马拉民主政府的反抗，其后危地马拉又宣布退出，以致“中美洲国家组织”一直没有开过正式外长会议。直到危地马拉民主政府被美国推翻后，才在1955年8月18日在危地马拉举行了一次会议，这次会议通过了一项“斥责共产主义和其他极权主义”的决议，立即暴露了“中美洲国家组织”被美国利用来进行侵略和奴役成员国的肮脏勾当的真实面目。　（锡玲）
