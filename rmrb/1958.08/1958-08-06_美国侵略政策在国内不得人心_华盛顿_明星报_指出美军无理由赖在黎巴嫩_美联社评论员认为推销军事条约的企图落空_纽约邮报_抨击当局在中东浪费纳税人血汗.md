Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: Washington News – The Washington "Star" published an editorial on August 1st arguing that the United States should immediately withdraw its aggressive troops from Lebanon.

The newspaper said: In any case, it seems clear that there is no legitimate reason for 10,000 U.S. Marines and paratroopers to remain in Lebanon for a considerable period of time. Obviously, as far as the domestic political situation in Lebanon is concerned, our troops have no role to play, and the sooner they withdraw, the better.

The newspaper said that the "conditions" for withdrawing our troops are quite available and this should be done as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: According to TASS, New York, August 4th: Associated Press diplomatic commentator Ryan criticized U.S. policy in the Near and Middle East, saying that for many years, the United States had wasted its efforts in "attempting to instigate Arab countries to join military treaties," and "this attempt has failed. The Baghdad Pact was concluded under U.S. planning at that time, but it is very strange that the treaty is named after Baghdad, but 90% of the literate residents of the city oppose the treaty."

Ryan pointed out that the United States formulated such a doctrine, "its purpose seems to be to protect the Arabs from the threat of communist military aggression," although there is no such danger.

The commentator confirmed: "The United States and Britain have always spoken on the side of unpopular people and unpopular systems." He wrote that in Iraq, the United States and Britain supported Nuri al-Said, "but refused to face the fact that the vast majority of literate residents of Iraq opposed Nuri al-Said's proposition." The commentator went on to say that in Jordan, King Hussein "can only maintain his regime by relying on the support of the United States and Britain." According to Ryan's estimation, the United States has spent $130 million in this regard since 1953.

Ryan believes that the United States' support for Chamoun in Lebanon and the United States' armed intervention in the country are serious miscalculations in the United States' policy in the region, because "the use of force can only lead to the growth of Arab nationalism."

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: New York News – The August 1st "New York Post" published a report from Washington by Robert Allen in the "Washington Insider" column. Allen said, "The military intervention of the United States and Britain in the Middle East has cost American taxpayers $200 million—and this is just the beginning."

Allen cited preliminary figures (up to August 1st) of itemized expenditures compiled by U.S. officials for U.S. and British intervention in the Middle East:

	Dispatching U.S. troops, "support activities" in Lebanon, "precautionary measures" around the world—$115 million.

	Emergency military and economic "aid" to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, etc.—$75 million.

	U.S. logistical "support" to British troops in Jordan—$10 million.

Allen said that the State Department has told the leaders of the (Congressional) Appropriations Committee that detailed estimates of the new "aid" costs needed due to the Middle East crisis have not yet been completed. It is explained that Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Jordan, and other countries are still making requests for additional huge expenses. The total number of these requests has reached more than 500 million U.S. dollars. And now there is no end in sight for these requests.

Allen also revealed that U.S. Department of Defense budget officials have submitted another $115 million price list for U.S. military operations in the Middle East to the House Appropriations Committee. He said that the United States will also pay for the expenses of 3,000 British paratroopers in Jordan.

    美国侵略政策在国内不得人心
    华盛顿“明星报”指出美军无理由赖在黎巴嫩
    美联社评论员认为推销军事条约的企图落空
    “纽约邮报”抨击当局在中东浪费纳税人血汗
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：华盛顿“明星报”在8月1日发表的一篇社论中主张美国立即从黎巴嫩撤退它的侵略军队。
    这家报纸说：无论如何，情况看来已很清楚，不存在任何正当理由使一万名美国海军陆战队和伞兵继续留在黎巴嫩相当长的时候。显然，就黎巴嫩国内政治情况而言，我们的军队没有可起的作用，能够使他们愈快撤出就愈好。
    这家报纸说，撤退我们的军队的“条件”已经相当具备了，这一点应该尽快地做到。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：美联社外交评论员瑞安抨击美国在中近东的政策说，多年来美国枉费心机地“企图唆使阿拉伯国家加入军事条约”，“这种企图已经落空了。当时在美国的策划下缔结了巴格达条约，然而十分奇怪的是，这个条约以巴格达市命名，但是这个市90％识字的居民都反对这个条约”。
    瑞安指出，美国制定了这样一种主义，“它的目的似乎在于保护阿拉伯人免遭共产主义军事进攻的威胁”，尽管并不存在任何这样的危险。
    评论员确认：“美国和英国从来就站在不受欢迎的人和不受欢迎的制度那一面讲话。”他写道，在伊拉克，美英两国支持努里·赛义德，“却拒绝正视这样的事实：伊拉克绝大多数识字居民都反对努里·赛义德的主张”。评论员接着说，在约旦，国王侯赛因“只是依仗着美英的支持才能维持政权”。据瑞安估计，美国人1953年以来在这方面花费了一亿三千万美元。
    瑞安认为，美国在黎巴嫩对夏蒙的支持和美国对这个国家的武装干涉是美国在这个地区的政策上的严重失算，因为“使用武力只能导致阿拉伯民族主义的增长”。
    据新华社5日讯　纽约消息：8月1日的“纽约邮报”在“华盛顿内幕”专栏中刊载罗伯特·艾伦发自华盛顿的一篇报道，艾伦说，“美国和英国在中东的军事干涉花了美国纳税人两亿美元——而且这仅仅是开始。”
    艾伦援引了美国官方编制的美英在中东进行干涉的逐项开支的初步数字（到8月1日为止）：
    派遣美国军队、在黎巴嫩的“支援活动”、在世界各地的“戒备措施”——一亿一千五百万美元。
    给予黎巴嫩、约旦、土耳其等国的紧急军事和经济“援助”——七千五百万美元。
    美国给予约旦英军的后勤“支援”——一千万美元。
    艾伦说，国务院已经告诉（国会）拨款委员会领袖们，由于中东危机而需要的新的“援助”费用的详细估计数字尚未完成。据解释说，土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦、约旦等国仍在提出要求给予额外的巨大费用的请求。这些请求的总数已达五亿美元以上。而且现在还看不出这些请求将告一结束。
    艾伦还透露说，美国国防部预算官员已经把美国在中东的军事行动的另一个一亿一千五百万美元的价目单交给众议院拨款委员会。他说，美国还将支付英国在约旦的三千伞兵的费用。
