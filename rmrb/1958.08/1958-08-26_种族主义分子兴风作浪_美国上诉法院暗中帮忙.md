Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 24th: As the new school year approaches, racists in the United States are once again engaging in frenzied activities. They continue to attempt to get the US Supreme Court to overturn its decision on integrating white and black students in municipal schools. As in the previous year, the center of racist activity is in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Arkansas Governor Faubus, the leader of the racists, launched another wave on August 19 to overturn the decision made by the US Court of Appeals on August 18. This decision, based on the request of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" (NAACP), overturned the decision made by Federal Judge Lemley to postpone the integration of Little Rock Central High School for two and a half years (the postponement decision was made at the end of the school year under pressure from local racists). Faubus demanded that the Little Rock School Board refuse to implement the Court of Appeals' final decision and prohibit seven black students from attending school in the new school year.

At the governor's request, the Little Rock School Board re-submitted a request to the Court of Appeals on August 20, asking for a postponement of the city's integration plan. On August 21, the court agreed to this request. According to newspaper reports, the official reason for granting the postponement was to allow the School Board time to apply to the US Supreme Court to revise the Court of Appeals' decision on integration.

Due to the court's new decision, the racists have gained time to prepare for further steps to finally bury the US Supreme Court's decision on integrated education.

According to an Associated Press reporter from Little Rock, School Principal Bloss announced that Central High School will open on September 2 as a "purely white high school."

In view of such rampant activities by racists, the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" (NAACP) re-requested the Supreme Court on August 22 to overturn the Court of Appeals' ruling on postponing integration.

### 种族主义分子兴风作浪  美国上诉法院暗中帮忙

　　种族主义分子兴风作浪  美国上诉法院暗中帮忙
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：在新学年即将开始的时候，美国的种族主义分子又猖狂地活动起来，他们继续企图要美国最高法院取消关于在各市立学校实行白人和黑人合校的决议。正像去年一样，种族主义者的活动中心是在阿肯色州的小石城。
    领导种族主义者的活动的阿肯色州州长福布斯8月19日又着手掀起废除美国上诉法院8月18日作出的决议的浪潮，这个决议根据“全国有色人种协进会”的要求取缔了联邦法官累姆利作出的关于延期两年半在小石城中心学校实行合校的决定（延期的决定是在上学年年终在当地的种族主义分子的压力下通过的）。福布斯要求小石城学校委员会拒绝执行上诉法院的最后决定，并且不准七个黑人学生在新学年上学。
    根据州长的要求，小石城学校委员会8月20日重新向上诉法院提出该城延期实行黑白学生合校的请求。8月21日法院同意了这个请求。据报纸报道，官方准予延期是为了使学校委员会有时间向美国最高法院申请修改上诉法院关于合校的决议。
    由于法院的新决定，种族主义者赢得了时间准备采取进一步的步骤，来最后地埋葬美国最高法院关于混合教育的决议。
    据美联社记者自小石城报道，学校校长布洛斯宣布，中心中学将在9月2日作为“清一色白人的中学”开学。
    鉴于种族主义分子这种猖狂活动“全国有色人种协进会”22日重新要求最高法院取消上诉法院关于延期实行合校的判决。
