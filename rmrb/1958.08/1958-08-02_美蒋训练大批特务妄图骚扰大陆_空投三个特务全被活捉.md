Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. The U.S. imperialists, who occupy our territory of Taiwan, are helping the Chiang Kai-shek clique train a large number of spies whose subversive and destructive activities are concentrated on the mainland. On July 3rd, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique once again airdropped three spy agents at the junction of Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, plotting to establish a counter-revolutionary armed base in the Shiwan (Ten Thousand) Mountains.

These spies were all captured alive by local soldiers and civilians the day after they were airdropped. At present, the public security organs of Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have completed the interrogation of these U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek airdropped spies.

This group of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spies was airdropped by a U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft in the territory of Qinbei Zhuang Autonomous County in Guangdong Province and Shangsi County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The weapons, radios, and other supplies carried by the airdropped spies were all made in the United States. The interrogation materials confirmed that the mission of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spies was to establish counter-revolutionary armed bases in the Shiwan and Liuwan (Sixty Thousand) Mountains, and to collect intelligence on the "anti-communist psychology of the people" in our Shiwan Mountains. This mission is an integral part of the U.S. imperialists' support for the Chiang Kai-shek clique's efforts to intensify harassment and sabotage against the Chinese mainland, and it is also an integral part of the U.S. imperialists' painstaking efforts to carry out subversive activities against the mainland.

However, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique's conspiracy is a waste of effort. The spies they airdropped were all captured by our vast army and civilians within 24 hours of landing. The two radios, six long and short guns, and other weapons and funds for activities carried by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spies were all seized by us.

The three U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek airdropped spies captured were: Huang Kexiang, Major Group Leader of "Group C-2" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Intelligence Bureau, Guangdong-South Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Airborne Group"; Huang Jiali, Second Lieutenant Group Leader of "Group C-3"; and Liu Jianlong, Lieutenant Radio Station Chief. Huang Kexiang is a professional spy trained by the American spy agency Western Enterprise Corporation. Liu Jianlong received training from American spy officers at the Taiwan "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class."

Spy Huang Kexiang confessed that the U.S. imperialists have trained a large number of spies for the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. Among them, the trained spies of "Class 31" and "Class 43" are concentrated in the Longtan area of Taiwan, waiting for an opportunity to be airdropped into mainland China. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's spy agency, the "Intelligence Bureau," is also recruiting many soldiers from Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi from the Taiwan army for spy training. For example, the Chiang Kai-shek clique instigated Zhang Ruigui, the notorious commander of the pseudo-46th Army, to organize the "Guangdong-South Headquarters of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," attempting to recruit Zhang Ruigui's subordinates who fled to Taiwan, vainly hoping to sneak back to the mainland to organize armed counter-revolutionary activities in the Shiwan Mountains. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek clique also compiled a group of prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers into the "Ministry of National Defense Special Operations Brigade," conducting paratrooper training in batches for the purpose of "counterattacking the mainland." It is thus evident that the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique conspired to forcibly abduct a group of prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers to Taiwan after the Korean armistice in 1953, and their sinister purpose has been fully exposed.

The U.S. imperialists not only instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique to intensify harassment and sabotage against the mainland, but also used every opportunity to plot the subversion of other Asian and African countries. In March of this year, just as the Indonesian army was suppressing the rebellion of the rebels, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spy agency "Sino-American Joint Works Office" sent spies to support the Indonesian rebellion with a large number of weapons. These weapons included mortars, rocket launchers, and various automatic rifles. A large number of weapons were loaded onto trucks in front of the "Intelligence Bureau" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Spy Huang Kexiang personally saw more than ten trucks.

The public security organs and garrison troops captured this group of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spies with the help of the broad masses. As soon as these spies landed, the local masses went out to search and arrest them. The teams searching for spies included more than 10,000 people, including farmers, militiamen, women, students, and children. (Attached picture)

### 美蒋训练大批特务妄图骚扰大陆  空投三个特务全被活捉

    美蒋训练大批特务妄图骚扰大陆
    空投三个特务全被活捉
    据新华社31日讯　侵占我国领土台湾的美帝国主义帮助蒋介石集团训练了大批特务，这些特务进行颠覆破坏活动的目标集中指向大陆。7月3日美蒋再一次在广东省和广西僮族自治区交界处空投了三名特务分子，阴谋在十万大山建立反革命武装基地。
    这些特务分子空降后在第二天便被当地军民全部活捉。现在，广东省和广西僮族自治区的公安机关已对这些美蒋空投特务侦讯完毕。
    这批美蒋特务分子是乘一架美制蒋机空投在广东省钦北僮族自治县和广西僮族自治区上思县境内的。空投特务所携带的武器、电台和其他用品都是美国制造的。侦讯的材料证实：美蒋派遣特务的任务是：在十万大山和六万大山建立反革命武装基地，并搜集我十万大山的“民众反共心理”的情报。这个任务是美帝国主义支持蒋介石集团加强对我国大陆进行骚扰破坏活动的一个组成部分，也是美帝国主义处心积虑地对大陆进行颠覆活动的一个组成部分。
    可是，美蒋的阴谋是妄费心机，他们空投下的特务分子在着陆后不到二十四小时，就被我广大军民全部捕获。美蒋特务分子携带的两部电台、六支长短枪以及其他武器和活动经费等全部被我缴获。
    捕获的三个美蒋空投特务是：蒋介石集团“情报局粤南反共救国军空降组”的“C二组”少校组长黄科祥、“C三组”少尉组长黄佳利和中尉电台台长刘剑龙。黄科祥是由美国特务机关西方企业公司训练出来的一个职业特务。刘剑龙曾在台湾“游击干部训练班”里受过美籍特务军官的训练。
    特务分子黄科祥供认，美帝国主义已经在台湾帮助蒋介石集团训练了大批特务分子，其中训练好的“三一班”和“四三班”的特务分子，正集中在台湾龙潭地区，伺机空投我国大陆。蒋介石集团的特务机关——“情报局”还在台湾军队中搜罗很多福建、广东、广西籍的士兵，进行特务训练。例如蒋介石集团指使罪恶昭彰的伪四十六军军长张瑞贵，组织“反共救国军粤南总指挥部”，企图搜罗逃往台湾的张瑞贵的部下，妄想潜回大陆在十万大山一带组织武装进行反革命活动。此外，蒋介石集团还把中国人民志愿军的一批战俘编为“国防部特种作战总队”，分批进行伞兵训练，作为“反攻大陆”之用。由此可见，美帝国主义和蒋介石集团在1953年朝鲜停战后共谋把中国人民志愿军一批俘虏强制劫往台湾，其罪恶目的已完全暴露无遗。
    美帝国主义不仅唆使蒋介石集团加强对大陆的骚扰破坏，而且还利用一切机会，阴谋颠覆亚非其他国家。今年3月间，正当印度尼西亚军队扑灭叛乱分子叛乱活动时，美蒋特务机构“中美联工处”曾派遣特务以大量武器支援印度尼西亚叛乱。这些武器包括迫击炮、火箭炮及各种自动步枪。大量的武器曾在蒋介石集团“情报局”门口装车，特务分子黄科祥亲眼见到的就有十卡车以上。
    公安机关和驻军捕获这批美蒋特务分子，得到了广大群众的帮助。这些特务刚刚着陆不久，当地群众就四出搜捕。搜捕特务的队伍中有农民、民兵、妇女、学生、儿童共一万多人。（附图片）
