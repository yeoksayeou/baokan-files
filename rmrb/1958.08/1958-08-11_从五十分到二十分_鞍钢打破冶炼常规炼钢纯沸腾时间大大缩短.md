　　From Fifty Minutes to Twenty Minutes
　　Anshan Iron and Steel Breaks Steelmaking Conventions, Greatly Shortening Pure Boiling Time

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th - Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently successfully tested a major technological innovation in open-hearth steelmaking: reducing the pure boiling time for each heat of steel from the original fifty minutes to twenty minutes. This will increase the output of open-hearth steelmaking by 5% without increasing manpower or equipment, and will also greatly benefit the service life of the furnace body.

Pure boiling is the final smelting stage of steelmaking, that is, the period from adding the last batch of ore after the furnace charge has melted to deoxidizing before tapping. Its function is to reduce the gas content in the steel, remove non-metallic inclusions from the molten steel, and heat it to the temperature required for tapping. Regulations stipulate that the pure boiling time for each heat of open-hearth steel must be guaranteed to be fifty minutes to ensure the quality of the steel.

Anshan Iron and Steel has been seeking ways to shorten the melting time of open-hearth furnaces for many years, but has never dared to violate the established convention of pure boiling time. Sometimes, it was even necessary to soak the molten steel that was ready for tapping in the furnace, waiting for the pure boiling time to reach fifty minutes.

Last year, Dong Xiuchun, Hu Wangan, and Luo Huanying, engineers from the Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel, boldly proposed reducing the pure boiling time to thirty minutes based on several years of practical operation, observation, and research. Their spirit of daring to think and dare to act immediately received the support of Party and administrative leaders and steelworkers. After about a year of experimental research, they finally successfully summarized in April of this year that the pure boiling time could be shortened to thirty minutes. Then, they continuously tested it more than twenty times in different open-hearth furnaces, proving that it could be further shortened to twenty minutes, and also extend the life of the furnace body.

    从五十分到二十分
　　鞍钢打破冶炼常规炼钢纯沸腾时间大大缩短
    据新华社鞍山10日电鞍山钢铁公司最近试验成功一项在平炉炼钢上具有重大意义的技术革新——将每炉钢的纯沸腾时间，由原来的五十分钟缩短到二十分钟。这样，在不增加人力、设备的条件下，平炉炼钢的产量可以提高5％，而且对延长炉体使用寿命也有很大好处。
    纯沸腾是炼钢的最后一个熔炼阶段，也就是在炉料熔清以后从加最后一批矿石到出钢前脱氧这一段时间。它的作用就是降低钢中的气体含量，除去钢水中的非金属夹杂物和加热到出钢所需要的温度。操作规程规定，每炉平炉钢的纯沸腾时间一定要保证五十分钟，对钢的质量才有保证。
    鞍钢历年来在寻求缩短平炉熔炼时间的途径，但从来未敢触犯已订的纯沸腾时间这一常规。有时甚至不得不将已具备出钢条件的钢水泡在炉子里，等待纯沸腾时间到五十分钟。
    去年，鞍钢中央试验室工程师董秀春、胡文淦、罗欢英等人，根据几年的实际操作、观察和研究，大胆提出把纯沸腾时间缩短到三十分钟的建议。他们这样敢想、敢干的精神，立即得到了党和行政领导人员以及炼钢工人们的支持。在经过一年左右的试验研究以后，他们终于在今年4月间成功地总结了可以将纯沸腾时间缩短到三十分钟，接着又连续在不同的平炉试验了二十多次，证明可以进一步缩短到二十分钟，而且还能延长炉体寿命。
