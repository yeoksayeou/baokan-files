　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th Dispatch: (Reporters He Changhua and Xie Zhilin) Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, is overcoming all difficulties and doing everything possible to support areas with weaker industrial foundations, vigorously helping the growth of new industrial bases. In this glorious task, many factories and enterprises have demonstrated a noble communist spirit.

　　This year, Shanghai's industry, according to the state's unified arrangements for supporting the whole country, was already very heavy. The Great Leap Forward plan exceeded the original target of a 35% increase over last year. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee decided that, under the principle of "not squeezing out the original tasks," it would make every effort to produce complete sets of steel smelting equipment with an annual output of 3 million tons of pig iron, 3.6 million tons of steel, and 2.8 million tons of steel products, as well as 15,000 machine tools and 540,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment, most of which are to support other regions. Under this call, the city launched an unprecedented large-scale collaboration. A total of more than a thousand units were unified and organized to undertake this arduous new task.

　　The new situation of industry blooming everywhere in the interior has raised a very sharp question for Shanghai's industry, especially some light industry sectors: how to reasonably divide labor with the interior. Some cadres were afraid that the development of industry in the interior would affect Shanghai's development. In response to this ideological concern, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee promptly educated cadres to proceed from the overall situation, enthusiastically and unreservedly imparting their technical experience to factories in the interior, providing various technical materials without reservation, and helping the interior to quickly catch up with them. It also educated cadres to actively implement the policy of developing Shanghai's industry towards high-grade, precision, and large-scale products, making Shanghai one of China's advanced science and technology centers. After ideological education, the workers of the Shanghai Glucose Factory saw the big picture and dispelled their doubts. They rushed to design a standard design for a glucose factory with an annual output of 500 tons, and also compiled a set of instructions for operators, specifically for use in other regions. They also actively trained complete sets of production workers and technicians in major trades for many regions such as Gansu, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong.

　　Many factories have demonstrated a selfless spirit in supporting industrial construction in other regions. This year, many regions across the country are preparing to produce steam turbine generating equipment, but in the process of trial-producing this complex and precise product, there are many difficulties, especially the lack of some important components. The Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, which were the earliest to manufacture steam turbine generating equipment in China, would rather have some impact on their own production than resolutely supply some of the key components they produced, such as impellers, blades, punchings, and magnetic poles, to Wuhan, Beijing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Nanchang, and other places. At the end of last month, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory also had such an incident: a steam turbine generator was in the final assembly stage, and the factory director suddenly decided to stop work and transfer its punchings, magnetic poles, pole shoes, and other components to Hangzhou. It turned out that the Zhejiang Electric Machinery Factory and Zhejiang University were preparing to study a major technological innovation that could increase the generating capacity of the generator by three times, and these components were urgently needed, so the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory took this emergency measure. At this time, it was the time when the factory was rushing to complete its monthly plan, and some people did not understand, but the factory director said: Whoever is important gets it!

　　"We are both competitors and close brothers." This is the noble quality demonstrated by the Jiangnan Shipyard in its race with the Dalian Shipyard to see who can build a 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel faster. Some of the components of Dalian Shipyard's ocean-going vessel were manufactured by Jiangnan Shipyard. During the manufacturing process, Jiangnan Shipyard always made the collaborative components for the other party first, and then made them for themselves; if some components could not be made in time, they even removed them from other ships to supply Dalian Shipyard.

　　"Collaborate to the end, support to the end" is another noble style shown in Shanghai's support for construction in various regions. They not only manufacture equipment, but also send people to other regions to help install equipment and assist in solving the technical difficulties encountered when starting production. Fufeng Fuxin Flour Mill transferred idle equipment and new equipment, and transferred a group of workshop directors, technicians, and workers to support Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and other provinces and regions.

　　Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee paid special attention to educating cadres to overcome various departmentalism and promote the communist spirit of collaboration. It severely criticized some factories that emphasized difficulties and were unwilling to actively undertake more support tasks, or were not enthusiastic enough about collaboration issues and tended to delay. The Municipal Party Committee also seized upon typical factories with poor style and conducted education for all factories in the city. On the other hand, for the tasks that poured in from various regions, it also adopted the policy of first urgent and then slow, first guaranteeing the needs of the development of the two industrial "marshals" of steel and machinery, and then general industry, to arrange production.

　　上海工人肩挑协作千斤担
    上千单位通力合作　用最好的设备和人才支援全国
    本报上海27日专电　记者贺昌华、谢芝麟报道：我国最大的工业城市上海，正在排除万难、千方百计地支援工业基础较弱的地区，大力帮助新工业基地的成长。在这项光荣的任务中，很多工厂企业表现出了崇高的共产主义风格。
    上海工业今年根据国家统一安排的支援全国的任务，本来已很繁重，跃进计划超过了比去年增长35％的原订指标、上海市委确定在“不挤掉原有任务”的原则下，年内再千方百计地生产年产三百万吨生铁、三百六十万吨钢、二百八十万吨钢材的成套钢铁冶炼设备、一万五千台机床和五十四万瓩发电设备，其中绝大部分是支援外地的。在这号召下，全市展开了一个空前规模的大协作。总共约一千多个单位，都统一组织起来，担当起这一繁重的新任务。
    内地工业遍地开花的新形势，给上海工业特别是一部分轻工业行业提出了一个很尖锐的问题：如何与内地合理分工的问题。有些干部唯恐内地工业发展以后，会影响上海的发展。针对这种思想顾虑，中共上海市委曾及时教育干部从全局出发，热心地毫无保留地向内地工厂传授自己的技术经验，毫无保留地提供各种技术资料，帮助内地迅速赶上自己；并且教育干部积极贯彻上海工业向高级、精密、大型的产品方向发展的方针，使上海成为我国先进的科学技术的中心之一。上海葡萄糖厂职工经过思想教育，看清大局、驱散疑虑以后，就突击设计了一套年产五百吨的葡萄糖厂的标准设计，还编印了一套操作工人讲话，专门供给外地；并且积极地为甘肃、云南、安徽、江苏、山东等很多地区培养了成套的主要工种的生产工人和技术人员。
    许多工厂在支援外地工业建设中表现出了大公无私的精神。今年全国许多地区都准备生产汽轮发电设备，但在试制这一复杂、精密的产品过程中，困难很多，特别是缺少一些重要的部件。我国最早制造汽轮发电设备的上海汽轮机厂、上海电机厂，宁肯自己生产受些影响，也坚决把自己生产的一部分叶轮、叶片、冲片、磁极等关键性部件，供给武汉、北京、杭州、南京、南昌等地。上月底，上海电机厂还发生过这样一件事：一台汽轮发电机正在作最后的装配，厂长突然决定停止工作，把它的冲片、磁极、极靴等部件调往杭州。原来是浙江电机厂和浙江大学准备研究一项重大的技术革新，可以使发电机的发电容量提高三倍，火急需要这些部件，于是上海电机厂便采取了这个紧急措施。这个时候，正是工厂赶着完成月度计划的时候，有人思想不通，但是厂长说：谁重要就给谁！
    “是竞赛对手，更是亲密的兄弟”。这是江南造船厂在同大连造船厂展开五千吨海轮谁造得快的竞赛中表现出来的高贵品质。大连厂的海轮有一部分部件是由江南厂制造的。在制造中，江南厂总是先替对方做好协作的部件，然后再给自己做；有的部件来不及赶制，他们甚至从别的船上拆下供给大连厂。
    “协作到家，支援到底”，是上海支援各地建设中所表现出的另一种高尚风格。他们不仅制造设备，有的还派人去外地帮助安装设备，协助解决开始投入生产时所碰到的技术困难。阜丰福新面粉厂把闲置设备和新设备，并抽调了一批车间主任、技术人员和工人去支援浙江、河南、湖北、内蒙古、青海等省区。
    上海市委在生产大跃进的形势下，特别注意教育干部克服各种本位主义，发扬共产主义的协作精神。对一部分工厂强调困难、不肯积极承担较多的支援任务，或者在协作问题上不够热情、能拖就拖的作风，提出严厉的批评；市委还抓住风格不高的典型工厂，向全市所有的工厂进行教育。另一方面，对于各地涌来的任务，也是采取先急后缓、先保证发展钢铁和机械两个工业“元帅”的需要、后一般工业的方针，安排生产。（附图片）
