　　World's Largest Hydroelectric Power Station—Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station

　　On August 21, 1950, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided to build the world's largest hydroelectric power station—the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station—on the Volga River. By October 14th of last year, the main works of the hydroelectric station had been completed and put into full production. The Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station, with a generating capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, surpasses the United States' largest Grand Coulee Dam, with a generating capacity of 1.974 million kilowatts, and ranks first in the world. This is a symbol of the great leap forward in Soviet electrification. Currently, the electricity produced by this hydroelectric station alone each year is equal to five times the total electricity output of all power stations in Russia before the revolution.

　　The construction of the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station can be said to be a technological masterpiece in modern hydraulic construction, because the entire dam is built on a foundation of sand and clay. The entire project of the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station includes a power plant building 700 meters long and 80 meters high, with a total volume much larger than that of the 32-story Moscow University building on Lenin Hills; an earth dam 2,800 meters long and 50 meters high; a reinforced concrete spillway dam 981 meters long capable of discharging 40,000 cubic meters of water per second; and two large ship locks with dock facilities. All these projects are of enormous scale. If the soil used to build the dam were loaded onto train cars, the train cars filled with soil would stretch from Moscow to Vladivostok. The hydroelectric power station is equipped with a total of twenty turbine generator units, each with a capacity of 105,000 kilowatts. These powerful generators are powered by the artificial reservoir - "Kuybyshev Sea" - formed by raising the water level of the Volga River by 25 meters with a dam. The "Kuybyshev Sea" is 600 kilometers long and 40 kilometers wide, with a total water storage capacity of 58 billion cubic meters, about ten times larger than Lake Geneva, and it would take the Dnieper River a year to fill such a large reservoir.

　　The Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station is not only grand in scale, but its construction was also extraordinarily rapid. Thanks to the creative labor of the hydroelectric station's workers and the high degree of mechanization of the construction work, the hydroelectric station was completed in only seven years, which is hard to imagine in capitalist countries. For example, the American Boulder Dam, which has only two-thirds the generating capacity of the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station, took forty years to build; the American Grand Coulee Dam, whose earth and stone works are only one-twelfth of those of the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station, also took a full twenty years to build.

　　The electricity produced by the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station each year can replace the labor of 63 million people, which is almost equal to the total population of France and the Netherlands. If a thermal power plant of the same capacity were to be built, at least 30,000 people would be needed for coal mining and transportation, but the entire staff of the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station will not exceed 500 people. With the completion of the Kuybyshev Hydroelectric Station, the electricity supply situation in Moscow, the Central Industrial Zone, and the Volga River Basin will be fundamentally improved. In addition, the "Kuybyshev Sea" formed by the construction of the power station will also irrigate millions of hectares of arid land in the Volga River Basin. (Bai)

　　世界最大的水电站—古比雪夫水电站
    1950年8月21日，苏联部长会议决定在伏尔加河畔建立世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站。到去年10月14日，水电站的主要工程便已建成，并全部投入生产。这个发电能力达二百一十万瓩的古比雪夫水电站，超过美国最大的发电能力为一百九十七万四千瓩的大库利水电站，居世界第一。这是苏联电气化大跃进的一个标志。目前，苏联单是这一水电站每年所生产的电力，就等于革命前俄国全部发电站电力产量的五倍。
    古比雪夫水电站的建设可以说是现代水力建设工程上的一项技术杰作，因为这一水坝全部是在砂和粘土的地基上建立起来的。古比雪夫水电站的全部工程包括一幢长七百公尺、高八十公尺、总体积比列宁山上莫斯科大学三十二层高楼的总体积还要大得多的发电厂厂房，一座长二千八百公尺、高五十公尺的土坝，一座每秒钟能泄水四万立方公尺的长达九百八十一公尺的钢筋混凝土溢水坝和两个带有码头设备的大型船闸。所有这些工程、规模都是非常巨大的。如果把建筑堤坝用的泥土用火车车皮装运起来，那么满载泥土的车皮就会从莫斯科一直排列到海参崴。水电站的发电厂里共装有二十台功率各为十万五千瓩的水轮机组。这些强大的发电机，是靠由拦河坝把伏尔加河的水面提高二十五公尺而形成的人工水库——“古比雪夫海”的水来推动的。“古比雪夫海”的面积长为六百公里，宽四十公里，共可容水五百八十亿立方公尺，比日内瓦湖约大十倍，要第聂伯河流一年才能装满这样大的水库。
    古比雪夫水电站不仅规模宏大，而且它的建设也是异常迅速的。由于水电站职工们的创造性劳动和建筑工作的高度机械化，水电站的建成只用了七年的时间，这在资本主义国家里是很难想像的。例如，发电能力比古比雪夫水电站小三分之一的美国波尔德水电站，足足花了四十年才建成；土石工程只及古比雪夫水电站十二分之一的美国大库利水电站，也是用了整整二十年才建成的。
    古比雪夫水电站每年生产出来的电力可以代替六千三百万人的劳动，这几乎等于法国和荷兰两国人口数目的总和。如果建立一个同样容量的火力发电站，那么至少需要三万人来进行采煤和运输等工作，然而古比雪夫水电站的全部工作人员却不会超过五百人。随着古比雪夫水电站的建成，莫斯科、中央工业区以及伏尔加河流域的电力供应情况，将得到根本改善。此外，由于建成发电站而形成的“古比雪夫海”，也将使伏尔加河流域几百万公顷的干旱土地得到灌溉。（白）
