Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 3rd: "Evening News" published an editorial today, emphasizing the fact that while Eisenhower's special envoy Murphy is visiting Baghdad and intends to visit Cairo, American troops are still pouring into Lebanon in large numbers.

The newspaper said that no matter how much Murphy talks about America's goodwill, as long as American troops are increasingly stationed in large numbers in Lebanon, people will not believe these words. The stationing of American troops in Arab countries is a threat to peace and security.

"Evening News" said, "We wholeheartedly desire to maintain peace and reach an understanding, but this must be based on dignity and a sound foundation, namely, the withdrawal of American troops and other countries' troops (especially the Sixth Fleet) from our Arab East, and the cessation of interference in our internal affairs."

    阿联报纸斥美两面手法
    只要美国不撤军而继续增兵
    墨菲的鬼话就不会有人相信
    新华社开罗3日电　“晚报”今天发表社论，着重指出这一事实：一方面艾森豪威尔特使墨菲访问巴格达并且打算访问开罗，而另一方面美国军队却仍然大量开入黎巴嫩。
    这家报纸说，无论墨菲怎样大谈其美国的善意，只要美国军队日益增多地大量驻扎在黎巴嫩，人们就不会相信这些话。美军驻扎在阿拉伯国家，是对和平与安全的威胁。
    “晚报”说，“我们全心渴望维护和平和达成谅解，但是这必须建立在尊严的和健全的基础上，即，从我们的阿拉伯东方撤出美国军队和其他国家军队（特别是撤出第六舰队），并且停止干涉我们内部的事务。”
