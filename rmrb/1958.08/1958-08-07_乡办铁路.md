    Township-Run Railway

    The Yong'an Township in Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, has decided to build its own 6-Li (3 km) small railway. Currently, it has completed 5-Li of roadbed construction and 2-Li of track laying. It is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic within August.

    The decision of the Yong'an Township General Branch of the Communist Party of China to build the railway has been enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole township. The broad masses of commune members contributed their labor and materials, and many commune members contributed old steel rails that were used in livestock fences and buried underground to support the township-run railway. The people of the whole township participated in road construction during the day to fight drought and at night.

    After the completion of this small railway, it can transport more than 1,000 tons of limestone and magnesite ore per day. (Yang Bairan, Ge Changzhi)

    乡办铁路
    辽宁省营口县永安乡决定自己修建六华里小铁路，目前已完成五华里路基工程和二华里铺轨工程；预计在8月份内可以全线通车。
    中共永安乡总支委员会修建铁路的决定得到了全乡人民的热烈支持，广大社员有力出力、有物出物，许多社员将搭在牲畜栅子里和埋在地下的旧钢轨献了出来支援乡办铁路。全乡人民白天抗旱夜间还来参加修路。
    这条小铁路修成后每天可以运出一千多吨石灰石、镁砖矿石。　（杨百然　葛长智）
