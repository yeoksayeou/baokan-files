Notes

    Who is Being Scared?
    After the American troops landed in Singapore, the American naval authorities, in order to conceal the American activities threatening peace, issued a statement on August 18 saying that the American troop landing was a "routine visit" for "rest and recreation." The next day, a US State Department official came out with the same statement.
    The matter is rather absurd. If it were really a "routine visit," why would the naval authorities and the State Department repeatedly issue statements? Is there such a government in the world that issues two statements every time its troops make a "routine visit"?
    Singapore is not a tourist resort, but an important British military base. Several thousand US Marines actually enter a foreign military base for "rest and recreation." Who has ever heard of such a fairy tale?
    US naval officials admitted that when these Marines entered Singapore, they were stepping up "the work of building warehouses in the strategic ports of this region." A British naval spokesman in Singapore also stated that the US military can freely set up its own warehouses in Singapore. So, what are these warehouses for? Are they for supplying the US military with "rest and recreation"?
    US naval officials admitted that "the Seventh Fleet is usually stationed in the Pacific waters east of Singapore." But why did its six warships and two thousand Marines enter Singapore this time? On this question, the US naval authorities and the State Department did not dare to give a clear answer.
    This trick of the United States shows that it wants to threaten peace in Southeast Asia, but it also wants to cover it up. The result is an attempt to hide something that is already obvious. It wants to intimidate peace-loving people, but it feels inadequate to the task. The result is that it has scared itself.

### 吓了谁呢？

    吓了谁呢？
    美军登陆新加坡以后，美国海军当局为了掩饰美国威胁和平的活动，在8月18日发表声明说，美军登陆是“通常访问”，是为了“休息娱乐”。第二天，美国国务院官员又出来作了同样的声明。
    事情未免荒唐。如果真是“通常访问”，那又何劳海军当局和国务院一再发表声明呢？难道世界上会有这样一种政府，每当它的军队进行一次“通常访问”就要发表两次声明吗？
    新加坡并不是游览胜地，而是英国的重要军事基地。几千名美国海军陆战队居然开进一个外国的军事基地去“休息娱乐”，有谁听说过这种童话吗？
    美国海军官员承认，当这些海军陆战队开入新加坡时，他们正加紧进行“在这一地区的战略要冲港口修筑仓库的工作”。新加坡的英国海军发言人也声明说，美军可以随意在新加坡设立自己的仓库。那么，这些仓库究竟是干什么用的呢？难道是供给美军“休息娱乐”的吗？
    美国海军官员承认，“第七舰队通常是驻在新加坡以东的太平洋海面的”。可是这一次它的六只军舰和二千名海军陆战队究竟为什么要开入新加坡呢？关于这个问题，美国海军当局和国务院都不敢明确答复。
    美国的这一套把戏说明了，它要威胁东南亚和平，但又要加以掩盖，结果是欲盖弥彰；它要恫吓爱好和平的人民，但是又觉得心有余而力不足，结果是吓了自己。
