　　Overnight
　　Liu Yi
　　Old Zhao from the publishing house came to our factory, asking us to help them rush-print a collection of poems by an Iraqi poet, "The World of Tomorrow." He hoped it could be available to readers within two days.

　　These days, our factory has been working for weeks without rest to rush-print documents for the upcoming National Industrial Exhibition. However, when I heard Old Zhao say "collection of poems by an Iraqi poet," I felt a sense of kinship from the bottom of my heart, making it impossible for me to say, "We have too many tasks and cannot accept it." But, as the person in charge of planning and scheduling the entire factory's production, I knew very well that it would be very difficult to get this done in the workshop. But in order to do something for the Iraqi people, I braced myself and discussed it with Workshop Director Old Wu. As soon as Old Wu heard it was to publish "collection of poems by an Iraqi poet," he readily agreed to work overtime.

　　The original manuscript arrived more than half an hour after work had ended. I ran to the workshop with a large package of manuscripts. Many workers had already washed their hands and were about to leave. When the typesetter Old Liu saw me in such a hurry, he could guess what was up. Old Liu is truly a decisive and efficient person when it comes to completing urgent tasks. If it's urgent, he can work for three days and three nights without eating, and he can handle it. Without knowing when, he saw the words "Iraq" on the manuscript in my hand, reached out and took the manuscript, and shouted as he flipped through it, "Comrades! Come quickly and typeset the Iraqi poet's collection of poems!"

　　With his shout, there was a buzz, and people gathered around. One person offered help, another stacked things up. Before the workshop director could assign tasks, everyone started picking up the type.

　　No one in the factory didn't want to contribute to this book. The printing and binding workers all came to ask me, "When will it be ready for printing?" "When will it be ready for binding?" They wanted to volunteer to work overtime.

　　Old Liu is an old typesetter who is almost sixty years old. He worked the happiest that night. From the collection of poems, he saw how much the heroic Iraqi people hate American imperialism and how much they long for tomorrow—a day free from the shackles of imperialism. He was happy for the independence of the Iraqi people. He also sympathized with Iraq's past. He remembered the past, before liberation, he had personally witnessed American soldiers rampaging on the streets of Beijing, and he also thought of how many Chinese people were crushed to death by American jeeps. When he thought of these things, he indignantly said: "We must never let the Iraqi people, who have already gained freedom, suffer the crimes of imperialism again. I want to do more for Iraq.

　　When Old Liu thought of these things, he became even more energetic. After typesetting the manuscript, he made the proof himself and helped proofread it. After proofreading, he went to revise the proof. He wasn't comfortable proofreading it once, so he proofread it again; he wasn't comfortable revising it once, so he checked it again. He wanted to make sure that there wasn't a single mistake in this collection of poems when it was printed.

　　In less than two hours, the book was ready for printing.

　　The enthusiasm of the workers in the printing workshop for supporting the Iraqi brothers was no less than that of Old Liu. Young worker Zhao Dacheng, upon hearing that he was going to print an Iraqi poet's collection of poems, wiped the machine clean, and even checked the screws. The specifications and dimensions had already been prepared, and even the wooden stoppers for mounting the plates were prepared properly. As soon as the plates arrived at the printing workshop, proofs were made in a few minutes, the rollers were pasted, and the machine started humming.

　　One by one, clearly printed copies came out of the machine. Every time one was printed, Old Liu's heart beat a little faster, because he knew that every second this book was printed earlier, it would increase our support for the Iraqi brothers; every copy that was delivered to the readers sooner would make the readers aware of the Iraqi people's wishes sooner.

　　Before dawn, 20,000 books were neatly placed in the finished product warehouse of the binding workshop.

　　一夜之间
　　柳毅
    出版社老赵跑到我们工厂来，要我们帮助他们赶印一本伊拉克诗人的诗集“明天的世界”。希望能在两天内和读者见面。
    这些天，我们工厂为了赶印就要开幕的全国工业展览会的文件，已经几个星期没有休息了。可是，当我听老赵说出版“伊拉克诗人的诗集”这句话，打心眼里感到亲切，使我没有勇气说出：“任务太多，无法接受”。但是，对一个计划和调度全厂生产的我来说，也确确实实的知道，接下来拿到车间困难很多。但为了能为伊拉克人民作点事情，我也就硬着头皮和车间主任老吴商量，老吴一听是出版“伊拉克诗人的诗集”，也毫不踌躇的答应加班做。
    原稿送来的时候，已经下班半个多钟点了。我抱着一大包稿子，往车间里跑。好多工人已经洗了手要走。排字工人老刘一见我这慌慌张张的样子，就猜个八九不离十。对完成紧急任务来说，老刘真是个干脆麻俐的手，要是急，那怕三天三夜不吃饭光干活，他也能顶下来。不知什么时候，他看到了我手里稿子上的“伊拉克”三个字，伸手就把稿子接过去，一边翻，一边嚷：“同志！快来排伊拉克诗人的诗集！”
    他这一嚷，嗡的一下子，人都围上来了，这个一搭，那个一叠，没等车间主任分配任务，大家就嘎嘎的拣起字来了。
    全厂没有一个人不想为这本书出一份力量，印刷装订的工人都跑来问我：“什么时候发印？”“什么时候装订？”他们好义务加班。
    老刘是个快六十岁的老排字工人，这一夜他干的最欢，他从诗集里看到英雄的伊拉克人民，多么仇恨美帝国主义，多么渴望着明天——摆脱了帝国主义镣铐的今天，他为伊拉克人民获得独立而高兴。他也为伊拉克的过去而同情，他想起了过去，在解放前他曾亲眼看到了美国兵在北京街上横冲直撞的情景，也想到了美国的吉普车压死了多少中国人，他一想到这些，就愤慨地说：“我们绝不能让已经获得了自由的伊拉克人民，再受帝国主义的罪。我要多为伊拉克做点事情。
    老刘一想到这些，劲头就更足了，把稿子排完，自己打了样子，帮助校对，校完了，又去改样，校一遍不放心，再校一遍；改一遍，不放心，再对一次，他要把这一本诗集印出来一个错字也没有。
    不到两个钟头的时间，这本书就付印了。
    印刷车间的工人，对支援伊拉克兄弟的热情，也不比老刘差，青年工人赵大成，听说要印伊拉克诗人的诗集，把机器擦的干干净净，连螺丝钉也检查遍了，规格尺寸早就搞好了，连上版用的木塞子也准备的妥妥当当。版一到印刷车间，没有几分钟，就打出了样子，贴好了滚筒，机器呼呼??的就开动起来了。
    一张一张的字迹清晰的印品从机器上印出来了，每印一张，老刘的心，就跳动一下，因为他知道，这本书早出一秒钟，就是增加我们一份支援伊拉克兄弟的力量；每一本早送到读者手里，就早日使读者知道伊拉克人民的愿望。
    不到天亮，两万本书就整整齐齐的放在装订车间的成品库里了。
