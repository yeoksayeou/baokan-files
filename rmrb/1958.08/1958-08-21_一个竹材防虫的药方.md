　　A Prescription for Insect Prevention in Bamboo

    Editor's note: This newspaper published a letter from Comrade Xie Junfei of the Harbin Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the "Everyone Contributes Ideas" column on August 5th: "Who can solve the problem of bamboo preservation and insect prevention?". As of August 20th, we have received sixty-four letters from readers introducing many methods of preservation and insect prevention. On August 13th, we selected and published three methods of bamboo preservation and insect prevention introduced by Comrade Yuan Jigen. Today, we are selecting and publishing this letter introducing bamboo insect prevention experience for your reference.

    Our teaching and research group is studying methods for preventing insects in bamboo. We now introduce a simple and effective control method that has been preliminarily tested and proven successful.

    The main insect pests that harm bamboo are bamboo powderpost beetles. It is a hard-shelled beetle. After testing with various agents, we have proven that the following formula achieves a 95% insecticidal efficiency and has a preventive effect.

    The formula is:

　　Pure DDT 4 parts
　　Pure 666 powder 2 parts
　　Sudan III (red pigment) 0.2 parts
　　Diesel 100 parts

　　Dissolve the above three powders in diesel to form a red solution. Use a brush to soak the bamboo material in this solution, and brush the affected bamboo. Re-apply after about half an hour after the first application. Apply more to the borer holes.

    In order to prevent bamboo from being damaged by insects, the bamboo can be immersed in this solution for fifteen to thirty minutes, and then taken out and dried in the shade.

    This agent was successfully tested in the laboratory and then tested in the bamboo structure warehouse of the Shanghai State-owned Yimin Tannery, and the effect was very good. The physical specimens were displayed at the Shanghai Science and Technology Research Work Leap Forward Exhibition in July.

### 一个竹材防虫的药方

　　一个竹材防虫的药方
    编者按：本报8月5日在“大家来献计”栏，刊载了哈尔滨市中国科学院土木建筑研究所谢君斐同志的来信：“谁能解决竹材防腐防虫问题”。截至8月20日，我们已先后收到六十四件读者来信，介绍了许多防腐防虫的办法。在8月13日，我们已选登了袁纪根同志介绍的三种竹材防腐防虫办法，今天再选登这篇介绍竹材防虫经验的来信，供大家参考。
    我们教研组正在研究竹材防虫的方法。现将已经初步试验成功的一种简便有效的防治方法介绍如下。
    为害竹材的害虫主要是竹长蠹。它是一种硬壳的甲虫。经过我们用各种药剂进行试验，证明用下列配方的药剂，杀虫效率达到95％，并有预防的效果。
    这个配方是：
　　纯滴滴涕  4份
　　纯六六六粉  2份
　　苏丹三（红色颜料）  0.2份
　　柴油  100份
　　将上列三种粉剂投入柴油中使其溶解，即成为红色的溶液。用毛刷浸满这种溶液，涂刷受害的竹材。第一次涂刷后过大约半小时，再涂刷一次。蛀孔处应多加涂刷。
    为了预防竹材受虫蛀蚀，可以将竹材用这种溶液浸渍十五到三十分钟，取出后阴干。
    此项药剂经实验室试验成功后，曾在上海国营益民制革厂的竹结构仓库中试用，效果很好。实物标本已于7月间陈列在上海市科学技术研究工作跃进展览会上。
