Xinhua News Agency, 8th. PLA soldier Wang Jixin of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has successfully trial-produced insecticide using wild grass and leaves. Tests have shown the insecticide has good results.

This insecticide is highly lethal, easy to obtain materials, and simple to produce. Put half a bucket of water in a wooden bucket, put chopped yellow wormwood, cypress branches, and willow leaves into the bucket, and after soaking for three to five days, it becomes insecticide. Sprinkling this insecticide on vegetable leaves can kill insects.

Wang Jixin boldly experimented with this insecticide while carrying out vegetable production. After spraying this insecticide in the vegetable garden, pests disappeared, and various vegetables grew very luxuriantly. Wang Jixin was therefore commended by the leaders of the unit.

    解放军战士王吉新用野草制成杀虫药
    新华社8日讯  中国人民解放军某部战士王吉新，用野草，树叶试制杀虫药水成功。经试验，杀虫效果良好。
    这种杀虫药水杀伤力大，取材方便，制作方法简单。在一个木桶里放半桶水，将切碎的黄蒿、柏枝、柳叶放入桶内，泡三、五天后即成杀虫药水。把这种药水洒在菜叶上，虫子即可死亡。
    王吉新是在进行蔬菜生产时大胆试验这种药水的。菜地里洒了这种药水，害虫绝迹了，各种蔬菜就长得很茂盛。王吉新因此受到了部队首长的嘉奖。
