　　Collection of Poems, Essays, and Paintings Celebrating the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué
    After the release of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as poets and painters in our country, created many literary and artistic works in a short period of time to express their heartfelt joy and celebrate this epoch-making document.
    The Writers Publishing House has promptly collected the poems, essays, and paintings published in various newspapers and periodicals, and compiled them into a book, which will be published soon. (Jing)
