Xinhua News Agency, 31st: New York dispatch: The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Alsop, openly advocating that the United States and Britain invade the Republic of Iraq.

Alsop admitted that those pro-Western governments in the Near and Middle East have completely lost popular support. He said that if the rule of the Faisal dynasty is not "restored" in Iraq, "all of the West's friends in all Arab countries will most certainly suffer." "Even the less costly expedient measure popular in London—using naked force when necessary to maintain some of the oil-rich small sheikdoms in the Persian Gulf—would ultimately cost more and be less effective than directly addressing the core of the problem (which is now in Baghdad)."

Alsop could not help but express his concern that the remaining members of the "Baghdad Pact" might collapse like dominoes. He wrote: "The bad things do not stop there. A neutral Iran, a neutral Pakistan, a Turkey gradually returning to the position it chose in the last war—these are further prices that will have to be paid. But things do not stop there either. Because when the oil lifeline of the Middle East is severed, it is the heart of the Western alliance that feels the pain."

At this point, Alsop openly advocated that the United States and Britain invade the Republic of Iraq. He said: "These are the reasons for taking bold action in Iraq. The vast majority of reasons for not taking action are nothing more than nonsense... Therefore, in the recent exchange of views between Washington and London, these nonsensical reasons were not given much attention." Alsop also knew that the Arab people and socialist countries would never allow the invaders to run rampant and trample on the people of the Middle East. He wrote: "The only real reason for not taking action in Iraq is the fear of what action the Soviets might take in response... If we grant King Hussein of Jordan's request for assistance, then the Soviets will want us to consider that they will grant the request for assistance from their Baghdad friends." But Alsop, who serves the monopoly capitalists, still clamored for "action with firm determination and the greatest speed," even though he himself knew, "it is almost too late."

### 美国记者艾尔索普为政府献策  公然鼓吹侵略伊拉克

    美国记者艾尔索普为政府献策
    公然鼓吹侵略伊拉克
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”发表了艾尔索普的文章，公然鼓吹要美英侵略伊拉克共和国。
    艾尔索普承认那些亲西方的政府在中近东已完全丧失了人心。他说，如果费萨尔王朝的统治不在伊拉克“恢复”，“所有阿拉伯国家里的西方所有的朋友十分肯定地将遭殃。”“甚至在伦敦流行的代价少的权宜之计——在必要时用赤裸裸的武力来保持波斯湾的一些盛产石油的小酋长国——结果也会比直接解决这个问题的中心（现在是在巴格达）要花较高的代价和收到较少的效果。”
    艾尔索普情不自禁地道出了他对“巴格达条约”残余成员国可能树倒猢狲散的忧心。他写道：“坏事情也并不到此为止。一个中立的伊朗，一个中立的巴基斯坦，一个逐渐回到上次大战中它所选择的地位上去的土耳其——这些是将必需偿付的进一步的代价。但是事情也并不到此为止。因为当中东的石油的命脉被割断的时候，感到创痛的正是西方联盟的心。”
    说到此，艾尔索普就公然主张美英侵略伊拉克共和国。他说：“这些就是在伊拉克采取大胆的行动的理由。不采取行动的绝大部分理由只不过是废话……因此，在华盛顿和伦敦最近交换意见中对于这些废话式的理由意味深长地没有给予什么注意。”艾尔索普也知道阿拉伯人民和社会主义国家决不会让侵略者横行霸道来蹂躏中东人民。他写道：“不在伊拉克采取行动的真正原因只有一个——担心苏联可能对此采取的行动……如果我们答应约旦国王侯赛因要求援助的请求，那么，苏联人就会要我们考虑，他们会答应他们的巴格达的朋友提出的要求援助的请求。”但是这个为垄断资本家服务的艾尔索普仍然叫嚣“以坚决的决心和最快的速度采取行动”，尽管他本人也知道，“这差不多已经太晚了”。
