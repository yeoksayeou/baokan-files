    Also a "Gun Target"
    Yì Fāng
    According to a United Press International report, American soldiers invading Lebanon are complaining about their situation, believing they are being used as "gun targets" there. The term "gun target," from the mouths of American soldiers, is quite an accurate and vivid metaphor. The fact is precisely this: the Lebanese people hate the American soldiers with gnashing teeth, and their bullets constantly hit the invaders' chests, to the point that the American soldiers are so frightened that they often can't sleep for several nights, and can only close their eyes for three or four hours under the scorching sun. Isn't this situation a vivid depiction of a "gun target"? However, this is entirely self-inflicted and well-deserved. Because playing the role of "gun target" was not forced upon them by others, but created by their government and those warmongers!
    In fact, it is not only the American soldiers who are acting as "gun targets," the American government and Eisenhower are also acting as "gun targets." The American aggression against Lebanon, apart from winning the cheers of a few loyal lackeys such as Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke, is in an unprecedentedly isolated situation. In particular, when the Soviet Union sincerely proposed convening a summit meeting, but the United States repeatedly delayed and obstructed it, and convened the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, attempting to salvage this broken tool, its bandit face was even more exposed, and it aroused even greater anger among the people of the world. The protests of people from all countries, and the condemnation of public opinion from all countries, are like sharp spears shooting at the American government, making Ike, who lives deep in the White House, restless, and making his advisor Dulles run around in a frenzy. They should taste the feeling of this "gun target" made by their own hands, which is not good! But what can be done? American imperialism will forever be a "gun target" in the face of all the peace-loving and anti-war people of the world!

    同样是“枪靶子”
    亦方
    据合众国际社报道，侵入黎巴嫩的美国兵正在抱怨自己的处境，认为他们在那里是当“枪靶子”。出自美国兵口中的“枪靶子”这个名词，倒是相当确切形象的一个比喻。事实正是这样：黎巴嫩人民对于美国兵切齿痛恨，他们的枪弹时时射中侵略者的胸膛，以至使美国兵惊恐得常常几夜不能睡觉，而只能在炎炎烈日之下阖上三、四个小时的眼睛。此情此景，不正是“枪靶子”的鲜明的写真吗？但是，这实在是咎取自取，罪有应得。因为充当“枪靶子”的角色，并不是别人强加到他们身上的，而是他们的政府和那些战争贩子们一手制造出来的！
    其实，岂仅是美国兵在当着“枪靶子”，美国政府和艾森豪威尔也正同样在当着“枪靶子”。美国侵略黎巴嫩的行为，除了赢得几个忠实的走卒如阿登纳、岸信介等的喝采外，处境是空前孤立的。特别是苏联诚恳地提出召开首脑会议，美国却一再拖延阻挠，并且召开巴格达条约理事会会议，企图收拾起这个残破工具的时候，他的强盗面目就更加暴露无遗，就更加激起全世界人民的愤怒。世界各国人民的抗议，世界各国舆论的斥责，像锋利的投枪一样射向美国政府，使得深居白宫的艾克坐卧不安，急得他的谋士杜勒斯东奔西窜，他们应该尝到这种由自己亲手制成的“枪靶子”的滋味并不好受吧！可是，这又有什么办法呢？美帝国主义在全世界爱好和平、反对战争的人民面前，将永远是“枪靶子”！
