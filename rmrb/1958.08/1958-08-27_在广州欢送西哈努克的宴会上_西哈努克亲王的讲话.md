Mr. Deputy Premier, Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　After visiting so many booming cities, now, at the final stage of our wonderful journey, we have arrived in a city that we are very familiar with. Indeed, Guangzhou is somewhat like the gate that opens to Cambodia. In 1956, when I first visited China, I first set foot on Chinese soil in Guangzhou. The brotherly friendship that is fully demonstrated today began to recover from my first visit to China.

　　I would also like to say to you that the large number of Chinese nationals in Cambodia today migrated from Guangdong and neighboring provinces. As I said in Beijing, in the course of more than a thousand years of contact, the blood of our two peoples has merged, and many of my compatriots are likely to find their ancestors in your province.

　　China's reception of us has been so moving, and its friendship with us is so sincere. On the eve of leaving China, I would like to once again express my gratitude to your leaders and all the Chinese people. We will never forget the days we spent with you, these days mark the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our two countries in the spirit of Bandung, in order to ensure the welfare of the two peoples and to maintain peace in Asia and the world.

　　I should especially salute Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi, who have always expressed true friendship towards our country, understanding of our problems, and supported us in overcoming difficulties. Thanks to the far-sightedness of these politicians, all our efforts and desires to establish close brotherly ties with China have been rewarded with good results.

　　As I have repeatedly said during my time with you, the path of peaceful coexistence we are following is a difficult and obstacle-ridden one, which has aroused the hostility of some countries towards us, but this is the only path that is in the interest of our country and in the interest of maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and no force can make us deviate from this path.

　　I would like to once again express my congratulations on the great achievements you have made and the unprecedented changes that your country has achieved. Please allow me to raise my glass to the eternal friendship between Cambodia and China, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, to the health of Premier Zhou Enlai, to the health of Marshal Chen Yi, to the health of the government leaders, to the happiness of the Chinese people, to the prosperity of Guangdong Province and to the health of the Governor.

　　在广州欢送西哈努克的宴会上
    西哈努克亲王的讲话副总理先生、省长先生、市长先生、女士们、先生们：
    在访问了这么多正在蓬勃发展的城市之后，现在，在美好的旅行的最后阶段，我们来到了我们十分熟悉的城市。的确，广州有点像对柬埔寨启开的大门。1956年我第一次访问中国的时候，就是在广州首先踏上中国的土地的。今天充分表现出来这种兄弟般的友谊正是从我第一次访问中国的时候开始恢复起来的。
    我还向你们说，今天在柬埔寨人数众多的中国侨民是从广东和邻近各省移居去的。正如我在北京所说的那样，在一千多年的接触过程中，我们两国人民血液已经融合在一起，我国许多同胞很可能在贵省找到他们的祖先。
    中国对我们的接待是如此动人，对我们的友谊是如此真诚，在离开中国的前夕，我要再一次向你们的领导人和全体中国人民表示感谢。我们将永远不会忘记同你们一起住过的日子，这些日子标志着我们两国为保证两国人民的福利、维护亚洲和世界和平而本着万隆精神进行合作的新纪元的开始。
    我应该特别向周恩来总理、陈毅元帅致意，他们一直对我国表示真正友谊，对我们的问题表示谅解，并支援我们克服困难。由于这些政治家眼光的远大，我们要和中国建立紧密的兄弟般联系的一切努力和愿望，得以获得良好的结果。
    如同我同你们相处的日子里一再说的那样，我们所遵循的和平共处的道路是一条艰巨的、障碍重重的道路，它引起了某些国家对我们的敌视，但是这是符合我国利益、符合维护亚洲和世界和平的利益的唯一道路，没有任何力量能使我们离开这条道路。
    对于你们获得的巨大成就，对于贵国所实现规模空前的变革，我谨再一次表示祝贺。请允许我举杯，为柬中的永恒友谊，为毛泽东主席健康，为周恩来总理的健康、为陈毅元帅的健康，为政府领导人的健康，为中国人民的幸福，为广东省繁荣和省长的健康干杯。
