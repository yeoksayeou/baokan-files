　　The Prince and the delegation were deeply impressed by the continuous progress made by the Chinese people in peaceful construction and expressed their heartfelt admiration and warm congratulations. The Chinese government sincerely thanks the Prince and the delegation for their congratulations, considering this a great encouragement to the Chinese people.

　　During the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong of the People’s Republic of China met with Prince Sihanouk and the delegation and had a sincere and cordial conversation.

　　Prime Minister Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai held several talks. Participating in the talks, among the members of the State Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, were: Ran Nhette and Kou Roun, Advisors to the Supreme Royal Council; Dy Phon, Minister of National Defense, Land Defense, and National Security; Touch Kim, Minister of Economy and Finance; and on the Chinese side: He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Premiers of the State Council; Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade; Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Wang Youping, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of Cambodia, and others.

　　The talks were conducted in an atmosphere of complete understanding and sincere cooperation. The Prime Minister and the Premier exchanged views on issues of common concern to the two countries and discussed the current international situation.

　　Both sides reviewed the pleasant development of Sino-Cambodian relations. This relationship was established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence after the Bandung Conference and was solemnly affirmed in the two statements signed in 1956 when His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai visited Beijing and Phnom Penh respectively.

　　The people of the two countries have always strictly adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, especially the principles of non-interference in each other's internal affairs and mutual respect for national sovereignty. As a natural result of this development in the relations between the two countries, the Kingdom of Cambodia recently proposed to the People’s Republic of China the establishment of normal diplomatic relations and the exchange of representatives at the ambassadorial level, which the People’s Republic of China accepted with great pleasure.

　　Both sides expressed satisfaction with the implementation of the Economic Aid Agreement signed on June 21, 1956, and carefully studied various issues related to the implementation of the Trade Agreement signed on April 24, 1956. In order to better implement the latter agreement, the two sides agreed that, in accordance with the principle of import-export balance stipulated in Article 1 of the said agreement, the two governments should, as soon as possible, agree on specific measures aimed at developing trade between the two sides. In order to help Cambodia's economic prosperity and industrialization, the Chinese side stated that, in addition to providing assistance to Cambodia in accordance with the Economic Aid Agreement signed on June 21, 1956, it is also prepared to help Cambodia build small joint steel plants, explore underground fuel resources, and help build other necessary related plants and explore other necessary related resources, etc., free of charge and unconditionally, according to the needs and possibilities of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

　　Both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress already made in cultural exchanges and friendly interactions. Both sides agreed to take appropriate steps to further develop cultural exchanges and friendly interactions between the two countries.

　　Both sides expressed satisfaction with the fact that the Chinese residents in Cambodia have always lived in friendship and brotherhood alongside the Cambodian people. Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government, reiterated that Chinese residents in Cambodia should strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the Kingdom of Cambodia and respect the customs of the Cambodian people, not participate in local political activities, and should assist the Cambodian people in their economic life in their efforts for national prosperity and economic development. Prime Minister Sihanouk accepted Premier Zhou Enlai's statement with satisfaction, and also stated on behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia its willingness to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese residents in Cambodia.

　　Both sides unanimously pointed out that the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Kingdom of Cambodia is not only conducive to maintaining the independence of the Kingdom, but also contributes to consolidating peace in Asia and the world, and therefore it should be respected by all countries. Premier Zhou Enlai stated that the Chinese government regrets the fact that Cambodian territory has been repeatedly invaded and blockaded by neighboring countries, considering this an extremely unfriendly act. The Chinese government hopes that the relevant Asian countries can abide by the Bandung Conference resolutions and coexist peacefully with the Kingdom of Cambodia, and not be influenced by foreign colonialist policies. Premier Zhou Enlai further pointed out that the Kingdom of Cambodia is one of the examples of pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality, and the Chinese government fully respects and firmly supports the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Kingdom of Cambodia. Prime Minister Sihanouk accepted Premier Zhou Enlai's statement with satisfaction.

　　Prime Minister Sihanouk stated that the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia believes that the participation of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, representing 600 million Chinese people, in international organizations and attendance at international conferences is an important and necessary factor for resolving international problems, and therefore is also an important and necessary factor for maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Premier Zhou Enlai thanked Prime Minister Sihanouk for this friendly expression.

　　Both sides unanimously believe that the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all countries must be fully respected, that the national independence movement is an irresistible trend of the current era, and that colonialism in all its manifestations, which runs counter to the historical trend, is an evil that should be eradicated swiftly. All international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations based on the principles of coexistence, and should not resort to war and the threat of force.

　　Finally, both sides expressed their willingness to constantly develop the economic and political relations between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of peaceful coexistence, for the mutual benefit of the two peoples and for peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    新华社24日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来和柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王联合声明，全文如下：
    在中华人民共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府建立正常外交关系的时候，柬埔寨王国政府首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，应中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来的邀请，以中华人民共和国政府国宾的身分率领柬埔寨王国国家代表团于1958年8月14日到达中国。
    柬埔寨代表团的成员是：

    团员　皇廷最高会议顾问兰·涅特阁下，
    团员　皇廷最高会议顾问古伦阁下，

    团员　皇廷最高会议秘书长清哈先生，
    团员　皇廷最高会议副秘书长冯马干先生，
    团员　国民议会议员洪金宽先生。
    首相和代表团的团员访问了昆明、北京、鞍山、沈阳、旅大、秦皇岛、天津专区，到处受到中国政府和中国人民的热烈欢迎和隆重接待，并且将要继续访问武汉和广州。首相和代表团的友好访问和他们在中国所受到的欢迎和接待，充分反映了两国人民间久已存在并且有了新的发展的深厚友谊和两国间的友好合作关系。
    亲王和代表团对中国人民在和平建设方面所取得的不断进步获得了深刻的印象，并表示衷心的钦佩和热烈的祝贺。中国政府诚恳地感谢亲王和代表团的祝贺，认为这是对于中国人民的极大鼓舞。
    在访问期间，中华人民共和国毛泽东主席曾经会见了西哈努克亲王和代表团，并且进行了诚挚的亲切的谈话。
    西哈努克首相和周恩来总理举行了多次会谈。参加会谈的，在柬埔寨王国国家代表团团员中还有：皇廷最高会议顾问兰·涅特、古伦，国防、地面防御和国家安全大臣丁源，经济和财政大臣笃金等；在中国方面还有：国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅，对外贸易部部长叶季壮、外交部副部长罗贵波，中华人民共和国驻柬埔寨王国大使王幼平等。
    会谈是在完全谅解和诚恳合作的气氛中进行的。首相和总理就两国共同有关的问题交换了意见，并且对目前的国际局势进行了讨论。
    双方回顾了中柬关系的令人愉快的发展。这种关系是万隆会议以后在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立起来的，并且在1956年诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下和周恩来总理分别访问北京和金边的时候所签订的两个声明中得到了庄严的确定。
    两国人民一直严格遵守和平共处五项原则，特别是关于互不干涉内政和互相尊重国家主权的原则。作为两国关系这种发展的自然结果，柬埔寨王国最近向中华人民共和国提出了两国建立正常外交关系并且交换大使级代表的建议，中华人民共和国极其愉快地接受了这项建议。
    双方对1956年6月21日所签订的经济援助协定的执行感到满意，并且仔细地研究了有关执行1956年4月24日所签订的贸易协定的各项问题。为了更好地执行后一个协定，双方同意，根据该协定第一条规定的进出口平衡的原则，由两国政府尽早商定旨在发展双方贸易的各项具体措施。为了有助于柬埔寨的经济繁荣和走向工业化，中国方面表示，除了按照1956年6月21日所签订的经济援助协定对柬埔寨提供援助以外，还准备按照柬埔寨王国的需要和可能，无偿地和无条件地帮助柬埔寨建设小型的联合钢铁厂和勘察地下燃料资源以及帮助建设其他必要的有关工厂和勘察其他必要的有关资源等等。
    双方对于在文化交流和友好往来方面现在已经取得的进展感到满意。双方同意采取适当步骤进一步发展两国间的文化交流和友好往来。
    双方对中国在柬埔寨的侨民同柬埔寨人民一贯友好地和兄弟般地相处的事实表示满意。周恩来总理代表中国政府重申：在柬埔寨的中国侨民应该严格遵守柬埔寨王国的法律和法令，尊重柬埔寨人民的习惯，不参加当地的政治活动，并且应该在经济生活上协助柬埔寨人民为国家繁荣和经济发展而作努力。西哈努克首相满意地接受周恩来总理的这种表示，同时也代表柬埔寨王国政府表示愿意保护在柬埔寨的中国侨民的正当权利和利益。
    双方一致指出，柬埔寨王国所奉行的和平中立政策不仅有利于维护王国的独立，而且也有助于巩固亚洲和世界的和平，因此它应该得到一切国家的尊重。周恩来总理表示，中国政府对于柬埔寨领土一再遭到邻国侵犯和封锁的事实感到遗憾，认为这是一种极不友好的行为。中国政府希望有关的亚洲国家能够遵守万隆会议决议同柬埔寨王国和平共处，而不要受到外国殖民主义政策的影响。周恩来总理进一步指出：柬埔寨王国是奉行和平中立政策的范例之一，中国政府完全尊重并且坚决支持柬埔寨王国所奉行的和平中立政策。西哈努克首相满意地接受了周恩来总理的这种表示。
    西哈努克首相表示，柬埔寨王国政府认为代表六亿中国人民的中华人民共和国政府参加国际组织和出席国际会议，对于解决国际问题是一个重要的和必要的因素，因此也是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要的和必要的因素。周恩来总理感谢西哈努克首相的这种友好表示。
    双方一致认为，一切国家的独立、主权和领土完整必须得到充分尊重，民族独立运动是当前时代不可抗拒的潮流，违背历史潮流的殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害。一切国际争端应该根据共处原则通过和平谈判求得解决，而不应当诉诸战争和武力威胁。
    最后，双方表示愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上不断发展两国的经济和政治关系，以利于两国人民的相互利益和东南亚和世界的和平。
