　　Nanjing Construction Bureau Wood Processing Plant Raises High the Red Banner of Saving Wood
　　Log Yield Exceeds 100 Percent
　　(Our report) The Nanjing Construction Engineering Bureau's Wood Processing Plant is making full use of wood and reasonably including "missing corners" when sawing into lumber, so that the log yield exceeds 100 percent. This year, the plant can save more than 8,000 cubic meters of wood for the country.
　　During the rectification movement, the plant's employees voiced their opinions on how to improve log yield. Through debate, they criticized the past erroneous thinking of "only managing lumber, not managing yield," only caring about producing more first-class lumber and earning more profits, and not paying attention to saving wood. Leading cadres also specifically studied methods of saving wood with the workers during on-the-job labor. After hard work, the yield gradually increased.
　　How can their log yield exceed 100 percent? In terms of operation, they have adopted the following innovative measures.
　　1. Overall planning, sawing according to the plan. According to the different sections of the logs, make the maximum output design drawings, and saw according to the plan in a planned way. This changed the past method of lumbering without a plan, without design, and relying solely on personal experience, avoiding waste.
　　2. Reduce the saw kerf. Generally, making lumber from logs requires more than a dozen sawing procedures, and the size of the saw kerf will affect the yield. The plant reduced the figure-eight saw teeth of the band saw from the original 2.5 mm to 2 mm. With this alone, the plant can save 700 cubic meters of wood a year.
　　3. When sawing lumber, reasonably include "missing corners." According to the actual needs of general components, when sawing square lumber or planks, it is permissible to have "missing corners" on one or two sides. Because when using square lumber to make doors and windows, it is also necessary to remove some of the edges and corners. This does not hinder quality and aesthetics. Since the volume of lumber with "missing corners" is calculated according to the volume of square lumber, the log yield, calculated from the volume, exceeds the original volume.

### 南京建工局木材加工厂举起节约木材的大红旗　原木出材率超过百分之百

　　南京建工局木材加工厂举起节约木材的大红旗
　　原木出材率超过百分之百
    本报讯　南京建筑工程局木材加工厂充分利用木材，并在锯制成材时合理地带“缺角”，使原木出材率超过百分之百。这个厂今年共可为国家节省木材八千多立方公尺。
    这个厂的职工在整风运动中，对于如何提高原木出材率进行了鸣放。通过争辩，批判了过去“只管制材，不管出材率”，只顾多出一等材，多赚利润，不注意节约木材的错误思想。领导干部在跟班劳动中，也同职工们具体研究了节约木材的办法。经过艰苦努力，出材率逐步提高。
    他们的原木出材率怎么会超过百分之百呢？在操作方面他们采取了以下的革新措施。
    一、全面规划，按图下锯。按照原木的不同断面，作出最大限度的出材设计图，有计划地按图下锯。这便改变了过去那种无计划、无设计、单凭个人经验的制材方法，避免了浪费。
    二、缩小锯路。一般原木制作成材，都要经过十几次的断锯手续，锯路大小会影响出材率。这个厂把带锯的八字型锯齿由原来的二点五公厘缩小到二公厘。仅此一项，这个厂一年就可以节约木材七百立方公尺。
    三、锯制成材的时候，合理地带“缺角”。根据一般构件的实际需要，在锯方材或板材的时候，允许带有一面或两面的“缺角”。因为用方整成材制作门窗时，也需要去掉一部分棱角。这样做，并不妨碍质量和美观。由于带“缺角”的成材体积是按方整成材计算的，这便使原木出材率从体积上算，超过了原来的体积。
