　　Leaping Forward and Not Forgetting to Help Others
    Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant Draws on Manpower, Provides Equipment, and Sacrifices Itself for the Collective
    (Our Correspondent Lei Runming reports) Taking the difficulties of others as their own and doing everything possible to help others solve their difficulties – this is a highly commendable communist spirit displayed by the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant in the Great Leap Forward in production.

    Since the beginning of this year, this mechanical plant, which is not large in scale and whose equipment is not perfect, has actively and enthusiastically supported many fraternal factories and enterprises in the city and other places in terms of raw materials, tools, and technical strength. Many fraternal factories and enterprises have given extremely high praise to their noble style of self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and consider it a worthy example to emulate and learn from.

    The Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant was very short of external components such as bearings and electric motors. In May, the demand for these two items increased by more than double the original plan. The factory sent people everywhere to purchase and expedite delivery. At this time, the original Beijing Sansheng Die Casting Factory, which was trial-producing the shaper, asked them to support them with electric motors. The relevant cadres of the factory discussed the matter. They realized that the successful trial production of the shaper by this small factory would be equivalent to adding a small machine tool factory. Without hesitation, they extracted an electric motor and supported the small factory. A staff member of the factory's supply and marketing section heard that a certain factory lacked large steel plates, causing difficulties in production. After he reported this situation to the factory leaders, the factory immediately assigned a special person to actively contact the factory lacking large steel plates and lent them the only part of their large steel plates. In May, the Zhangdian Abrasives Factory in Shandong lacked pig iron filings and faced the danger of shutting down. When the factory asked them for support, they extended a warm helping hand, took out 40 tons of pig iron filings from their own factory, and transported them to Shandong as quickly as possible, ensuring that the factory completed its production task as scheduled.

    According to statistics, in the first seven months of this year, under the circumstances of heavy production tasks and a shortage of raw materials, the factory supported more than 70 fraternal factories and enterprises with its own products, raw materials, tools, etc., with more than 100 tons of steel materials alone. June was a particularly busy month for the factory. They also supported fraternal factories and enterprises with 44 tons of steel, 27 shapers beyond the state plan, processed 227 large and small parts of 19 types for 16 fraternal factories, and transferred 14 technicians to support six fraternal factories in the trial production of new products.

    The factory also implements contracts signed with fraternal units very well. In the first half of the year, all 726 lathes in the contracts signed with hundreds of units were delivered ahead of schedule or on time.

    The Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant's lofty communist style of consciously subordinating itself to the overall interests was gradually formed in the Rectification Campaign. In the Rectification Campaign, the factory's Party organization criticized the parochialism of cadres and some employees who lacked an overall perspective and did not pay attention to mutual assistance and cooperation. Originally, when the factory was experiencing difficulties with materials and tools, it had also received assistance from the Beijing People's Machinery Factory and the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. This fact made the factory's employees deeply realize that although there is a distinction between you and me among factories and enterprises, what they are doing is a common cause. If there are difficulties, they must help each other and earnestly strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation.

    Now, it has become a conscious act for the vast number of employees of the factory to enthusiastically and actively help others.

### 跃进不忘帮别人  北京机床二厂抽人力，出设备，舍己为群

　　跃进不忘帮别人
    北京机床二厂抽人力，出设备，舍己为群
    本报讯　记者雷润明报道：把别人的困难当成自己的困难，并且千方百计地帮助别人解决困难，这是北京第二机床厂在生产大跃进中所表现出来的一种极其可贵的共产主义精神。
    这个规模不大、设备也不完善的机械厂，今年以来在原材料、工具、技术力量等方面，对本市和外地的很多兄弟工厂和企业积极热情地进行了支援，很多兄弟工厂和企业对于他们这种舍己为人的高尚风格给予了极高的评价，认为这是值得效法和学习的榜样。
    北京第二机床厂轴承和电动机等外构件非常缺乏，5月份这两种东西的需要量较原计划增加一倍以上，工厂派人四处采购、催货。这时正在试制牛头刨车床的原北京三盛试模厂，要求他们支援电动机。工厂的有关干部讨论了这件事，他们认识到这个小工厂试制成功牛头刨车床后，就等于增加一个小机床厂，毫不迟疑地抽出了一台电动机车，支援了这个小工厂。这个工厂供销科的一个工作人员，听说某工厂缺乏大块钢板，生产发生了困难。他把这一情况向工厂领导人汇报后，工厂立即指定专人同缺乏大块钢板的工厂主动进行联系，把自己仅有的一部分大块钢板借给了这个工厂。5月份山东张店沙轮厂缺乏生铁肖，面临停产危险，当这个工厂要求他们支援时，他们伸出了热情援助的手，把本厂的生铁肖拿出了四十吨，并以最快的速度运往山东，保证这个工厂如期完成了生产任务。
    据统计，这个工厂在今年前七个月中，在生产任务繁重、原材料缺乏的情况下，用自己的产品、原材料、工具等支援了七十多个兄弟工厂和企业，仅钢铁材料就有一百多吨。6月是这个工厂任务特别紧张的月份，他们还支援了兄弟工厂企业四十四吨钢材，二十七台国家计划以外的牛头刨车床，给十六个兄弟工厂加工了十九种二百二十七个大小不同的零件，还抽调十四名技术工人支援六个兄弟工厂进行新产品的试制。
    这个工厂对和兄弟单位订立的合同也执行得很好。上半年和数百个单位订立的合同中的七百二十六台车床都提前或按时交了货。
    北京第二机床厂这种自觉地服从整体利益的崇高的共产主义风格，是在整风运动中逐渐形成的。在整风运动中，这个厂的党组织对各级干部和有些职工缺乏整体观念不注意互助协作的本位主义思想，进行了批判。原来，这个工厂在材料工具困难的时候，也曾得到北京人民机器厂和上海机床厂的帮助。这个事实，使这个工厂的职工深刻地认识到工厂企业间虽有你我之分，但所进行的都是共同的事业，有困难必须互相帮助，认真地加强互助协作。
    现在这个工厂的广大职工热情积极地帮助别人，已成为一种自觉的行为。
