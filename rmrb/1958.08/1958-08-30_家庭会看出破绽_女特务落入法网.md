The People's Net of Justice

　　After listening to the public security personnel's propaganda about implementing the mass line in solving cases, Chen Yaolin, an old man from Shantou City, held a family meeting at home. At this meeting, everyone provided many suspicious details about his cousin, Chen Aizhen, after she returned from Singapore.

　　His daughter-in-law, Zheng Saihua, said first: One night, when I was ironing clothes, the child cried. As soon as Aunt Aizhen heard it, she told me to go and stay with the child while he slept, so I went. When I came back, Aunt Aizhen and the iron were gone. I called out a few times, and Aunt Aizhen answered from her room, "I have something to do, don't come in." I walked over quietly and looked through the window, and saw her ironing a letter in her room. His son, Chen Youjun, also said: "Aunt Aizhen asked me to write a letter once, saying that someone used to be a Kuomintang member and that their current situation was unclear. After I wrote it, she said it wasn't needed, but I didn't see her throw it away. Later I thought: she can write letters, why did she ask me to write it for her?"

　　Then, the whole family, old and young, spoke one after another, saying: "She often burns letters, what's going on?"

　　"She said she was a tailor in Singapore, why can't she alter a single suit?"

　　"She doesn't work after she comes back, but she spends money very generously, where does the money come from?"

　　"When she first came back, she went to the street with me and asked me if anyone was watching us from behind? Why would a legitimate returned overseas Chinese be afraid of being watched?"

　　At this time, the nine-year-old child Chen Zhewa rolled his eyes and said: "Grandma-aunt asked me to buy gallnut and alcohol from the pharmacy, saying it was for treating athlete's foot, but I never saw her use it!"

　　Listening to everyone's words, the old man Chen Yaolin nodded constantly. Finally, he sighed and said: "I originally thought Aizhen's style was not good, and she was particular about her life; now it seems that there may be political problems. But everyone only has suspicions and no evidence. If we report her, if she is not a bad person, wouldn't we be wronging her?" His son Chen Guibiao said: "Dad, it doesn't matter. If we find it suspicious, we should report it; if we report it, the government will investigate to be sure before handling it, and it won't wrong good people."

　　The whole family agreed with his view. So, the old man Chen Yaolin reported it to the Public Security Bureau.

　　Later, after investigation by the public security organs: this returned overseas Chinese Chen Aizhen, who claimed to be a tailor in Singapore, turned out to be sent by the U.S.-Chiang special agent organs to specifically collect our military intelligence. After she returned to China in November 1957, she used gallnut as a secret writing agent and made many contacts with the bandit secret service organs. She also developed two bad elements with class hatred towards us as spies. In this way, Chen Aizhen was finally arrested. On the spot, evidence of her crimes, such as the instructions from the secret service, was also found. (Gong Zhan)

　　家庭会看出破绽  女特务落入法网
    汕头市陈耀林老大爷，听了公安人员关于贯彻群众路线破案的宣传后，便回家召开了个家庭会。在这个会上，大家提供了许多有关他的堂妹陈爱珍从新加坡回来后的可疑情况。
    媳妇郑赛花首先说：一天晚上，我在烫衣服时，孩子哭了。爱珍姑一听，就叫我去伴孩子睡，我就去了。我回来时，爱珍姑和熨斗都不见了。我喊了几声，爱珍姑在她房里应道：“我有事，你不要进来”。我轻轻走过去，从窗口一望，看见她正在房里烫信。儿子陈有俊也说：“爱珍姑叫我写过一次信，说有个人过去是国民党，现在情况不明。我写好后，她又说不用了，可也没见她扔掉。后来我想：她会写信，为什么叫我替她写？”
    接着，全家老小你一言，我一语地说：“她经常把信烧掉，这是怎回事？”
    “她说她在新加坡做裁缝，为什么一件西装都改不了？”
    “她回来后不做工作，可是花钱很大方，钱是那里来的？”
    “她刚回来时跟我上街，问我后面是否有人监视？一个正当的归国华侨，为什么怕人监视？”
    这时，九岁的小孩陈哲娃翻了翻眼珠说：“姑婆叫我去药店买过五倍子，酒精，说是擦脚气用，可是总没有见她擦过！”
    听着大家的话，陈耀林老大爷不断点头。最后，他感叹地说：“我原来想爱珍是作风不好，生活讲究些；现在看来，可能有政治问题。不过大家都是有疑无证。要是把她检举了，她若不是坏人，不是冤枉了她吗？”儿子陈桂标说：“爸爸，这不要紧。我们觉得可疑，就应该检举；检举了，政府也要调查确实才能办理，不会冤枉好人的。”
    全家都同意了他的看法。于是，陈耀林老大爷便向公安局检举了。
    后来，经公安机关查明：这个自称在新加坡做裁缝的归国华侨陈爱珍，原来是美蒋特务机关派来专门收集我方军事情报的。她从1957年11月回国后，就曾用五倍子做密写剂，和匪特机关作了多次联系。并且还发展了同我有阶级仇恨的两个坏分子做特务。就这样，陈爱珍终于被捕了。当场，还搜出了特务机关给她的指示信等罪证。　（公展）
