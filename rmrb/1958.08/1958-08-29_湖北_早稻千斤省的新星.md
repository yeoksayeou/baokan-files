Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 28th: Following Anhui and Jiangsu, Hubei Province has also achieved a bumper harvest of early rice across the entire province, with an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The province's 4,627,700 mu of early rice yielded a total of 4,777,700,000 jin of rice, with an average yield of 1,032.5 jin per mu, an increase of 139.1% compared to last year. The total output increased by 209.85% compared to last year, exceeding the total output of early rice in the past five years by 633 million jin.

Of the six special districts in Hubei Province, the Xiaogan and Huanggang special districts, which cultivate the most early rice, account for approximately 60% of the province's early rice area. The early rice yields in both special districts are very high. Xiaogan Special District's 1,401,000 mu of early rice averaged 1,212.4 jin per mu; Huanggang Special District's 1,375,000 mu averaged 1,080.5 jin per mu. Among the province's 71 counties, 30 counties, including Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Macheng, Qichun, Hanchuan, Hanyang, Huangpi, and Xishui, have average yields ranging from 1,000 jin to 1,855 jin per mu. According to incomplete statistics from the Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, and Xiangyang special districts, there are 571 townships with average yields ranging from 1,200 jin to 3,100 jin per mu, among which the Chezhan Township in Xiaogan County averaged more than 3,192 jin per mu; there are 3,072 communes with average yields ranging from 1,500 jin to 4,100 jin per mu, among which the Wanjin Commune in Xiaogan County averaged 4,120.8 jin per mu; there are 57,351 mu of high-yield fields with average yields ranging from 3,000 jin to 5,000 jin, 8,583 mu with average yields ranging from 5,000 jin to 10,000 jin, 276 mu with average yields ranging from 10,000 jin to 20,000 jin, and 14.126 mu with yields exceeding 20,000 jin, among which the Jianguo First Cooperative in Macheng County created a high-yield record of 36,956 jin per mu.

From the above facts, it can be seen that the greatest characteristic of this year's bumper harvest of early rice in Hubei Province is that it not only has high-yield "satellites" but also achieves balanced increases in large areas. Throughout the province, a large number of red flags for balanced yield increases over large areas have been raised. The extent of balanced yield increases over large areas is also very significant.

For several months, when farmers proposed creating records of 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu on small plots of land, the "wait-and-see faction," the "conservative faction," and the "settle-accounts-after-the-harvest faction" members all shook their heads. Now, those who cannot see the development of the situation and cannot see the irresistible power that the Party's leadership and the people's creativity can produce have lost all their "capital."

Currently, the masses in Hubei Province are holding high the victorious red flag of the bumper harvest of early rice, continuing to advance victoriously with full confidence, grasping the field management of major autumn crops, and fighting to achieve an even greater bumper harvest of major autumn crops.

　　湖北  早稻千斤省的新星
    据新华社武汉28日电　继安徽、江苏之后，湖北省全省的早稻也获得了平均亩产千斤以上的大丰收。这个省的四百六十二万七千亩早稻共收了稻谷四十七亿七千七百万斤，平均亩产量为一千零三十二点五斤，比去年提高139.1％。总产量比去年增长了209.85％，比过去五年早稻产量的总和还多六亿三千三百万斤。
    湖北省六个专区中种早稻最多的孝感和黄冈两个专区，早稻面积约占全省的60％。这两个专区的早稻产量都很高。孝感专区一百四十万一千亩早稻平均亩产一千二百一十二点四斤；黄冈专区一百三十七万五千亩，平均亩产一千零八十点五斤。全省共有七十一个县，其中平均亩产量在一千斤到一千八百五十五斤以上的，有孝感、应城、麻城、蕲春、汉川、汉阳、黄陂和浠水等三十个县。据黄冈、孝感、荆州、襄阳四个专区的不完全统计：平均亩产一千二百斤到三千一百斤以上的乡共有五百七十一个，其中孝感县车站乡平均亩产三千一百九十二斤多；平均亩产一千五百斤到四千一百斤以上的社共有三千零七十二个，其中孝感县万金社平均亩产四千一百二十点八斤；平均亩产三千斤到五千斤的高产田有五万七千三百五十一亩，五千斤以上到一万斤的有八千五百八十三亩，一万斤以上到二万斤的有二百七十六亩，二万斤以上的有一四点一二六亩，其中麻城县建国一社创造亩产三万六千九百五十六斤的高产纪录。
    从以上事实可以看出，今年湖北省早稻大丰收的最大特色是：不仅有高额“卫星”，而且作到了大面积平衡增产。全省各地升起了大批大面积平衡增产的红旗。大面积平衡增产的幅度也很大。
    几个月来，当农民提出要在小面积土地上创亩产两千斤到三千斤以上的纪录的时候，“观潮派”、“保守派”和“秋后算账派”分子都摇头。现在，这些看不到形势发展，看不到党的领导和群众的创造会产生不可抗拒的威力的人已经把所有的“资本”也都输光了。
    目前，湖北省各地群众正高举着早稻大丰收的胜利红旗，满怀信心继续乘胜前进，大抓大秋作物的田间管理，为争取大秋作物的更大丰收而斗争。
