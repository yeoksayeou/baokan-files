    Club Leap Forward Shed Door Bulletin
    —Introducing Three Good Ways of Rural Propaganda Work in Xichong County, Sichuan
    By our reporter Yu Zhangrui
    Xichong County is located in the hilly area of northern Sichuan Province. Since the Great Leap Forward, the farmers of this county have been very motivated. The whole county has transformed 22,000 mu of sloping land into terraced fields, built more than 4,500 kilometers of roads accessible to vehicles, started construction on and completed 54 hydropower stations, and expanded irrigation area by more than 59,000 mu. This county, known as the "Sweet Potato Kingdom," has planted 308,000 mu of sweet potatoes this year. They are now generally growing well, with an average yield estimated at 10,000 jin per mu, an increase of five and a half times compared to last year.
    The achievement of these results is mainly due to the thorough victory of the rural rectification movement under the leadership of the Party, and the full development of the revolutionary drive of the broad masses of farmers. At the same time, it is inseparable from the Xichong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully relying on the masses to carry out ideological and political education and propaganda work.
    Rural propaganda and cultural entertainment work in Xichong County is very active. There are 25 frequently used forms of propaganda, such as clubs, Leap Forward command sheds, door bulletin boards, comparison platforms, Leap Forward newspapers, honor rolls, magpie reports, mobile bulletin boards, and field propaganda signs. What is introduced below are rural clubs, Leap Forward command sheds, and door bulletin boards in Xichong County.
    Rural clubs are important propaganda positions of the Party in the countryside. Basically all of the 1,177 agricultural production cooperatives in the county have clubs. In order to combine propaganda with cultural and recreational activities, and to make propaganda diverse, interesting, lively, and dynamic, they have adopted the method of taking the propaganda network as the core, propagandists as the backbone, and the club as the base, constantly carrying out socialist ideological education among the masses. The county has more than 50,000 propagandists and 38,000 club activists, forming a fixed propaganda army of 90,000 people. It vigorously promotes the Party's policies, inspires the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and promotes production.
    The No. 11 and No. 12 Agricultural Production Cooperative Clubs in Renhe Township created the "Six Tos, Two Talks, and Two No Talks" working method, that is, "Go to the fields, to the mountains, to the construction sites, to the courtyards, propaganda can be done everywhere, and activities can be carried out everywhere." "Only talk about the frequency of activities, not about the size of activities; only talk about promoting production, not about formal pomp." This has become a banner for clubs throughout the county. The 31 agricultural production cooperatives in Hongxi Township, with 3,740 households and more than 17,000 people, have 22 clubs. The basic construction team club in this township often conducts ideological education for 476 team members from 31 cooperatives. Combining production with the ideological conditions of the team members, they composed more than 100 ballads, wrote 75 propaganda signs, mobilized the masses to write more than 260 big-character posters, and held three moonlight parties. At the parties, they told revolutionary stories of the Red Army's Long March, Ding Youjun, Huang Jiguang, and other martyrs. The amateur theater troupe also performed operas such as "Liu Jiemei Turns Back." At the beginning, the club found that some team members were afraid of hardship and lacked enthusiasm for work, so the club activists compiled ballads such as "One year of hard work for ten years of sweetness, ten years of hard work for ten thousand years of sweetness, now leap forward and work hard, and the descendants will be happy for ten thousand years" and "Hands are worn with thousands of layers of calluses, sweat washes away thousands of mountains, the eight-character work is a great leap forward, and socialism will be realized soon" to carry out positive propaganda education for them. When the Sixth Squad united well, produced well, and created a method of hoisting soil with a steelyard, and attended the model meeting of the construction team, the club sent magpie reports and good news reports. It was written on it: "Sixth Squad, great achievements, leading everyone to engage in eight-character work. No fear of great difficulties, everyone praises them. Go to work ahead, and go back last. Unity is well done, and work enthusiasm is great. Constantly improve technology and create wonders. Attend the model meeting and wear a flower of glory. Advanced again and advanced, wear a flower again and wear a flower." As a result, the Sixth Squad became even more motivated, working with laughter and increasing work efficiency by two times, and was listed on the honor roll three times. Under the leadership of the Sixth Squad, the First Squad and the Twelfth Squad also became model teams. The club also established a Leap Forward comparison platform, with pictures of people riding rockets, airplanes, trains, cars, bicycles, cows, and pigs. Under each project, the team name and the person's name are written. In red paper, the words "Catch up with the train, chase the airplane, and be sure to chase the rocket" are written in large characters. Under each project, poems are written separately: "Riding a rocket is top-notch, riding an airplane is praised by everyone, riding a train is very enthusiastic, riding a car adds fuel, bicycles are not left behind, those who ride cows run with energy, and those who ride pigs walk quickly." The Leap Forward comparison platform has played a good role in commending the advanced and encouraging the backward to catch up with the advanced. Because the club's propaganda work is done well, the team members have always been very motivated. In addition to transforming sloping land into terraced fields and building roads, they also built 90 buildings, a hydropower station, and established six factories including iron, wood, bamboo, lime, saltpeter boiling, and bricks and tiles for the Beacon Fire First Cooperative. The team members sang a allegro poem to describe their happy labor: "Singing all over the mountains, activities full of construction sites, creations everywhere, everyone is happy."
    The reason why rural clubs in Xichong County can carry out propaganda work so closely combined with the production center is inseparable from the leadership of the Xichong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Before last winter, clubs generally had a tendency to emphasize entertainment over propaganda. As soon as an activity was held, it was "wearing robes and beards and banging big gongs," and the masses called the club a "drama club." When various cultural propaganda business departments went to the countryside, they also carried out their own single-line activities, competing for people and time with each other. The County Committee held several meetings to study and decide that the Party Committee Secretary at all levels must personally grasp ideological and political work and lead the club; when various cultural propaganda departments go to the countryside to carry out work, they must cooperate with each other and carry out their own business around the club; resolutely implement the policy of "small-scale and diverse, serving politics, and serving production." Therefore, with the great leap forward in agricultural production, propaganda work has also made a great leap forward, which in turn has promoted the leap forward in agricultural production.
    The Leap Forward command shed (also known as the Leap Forward shed) is located on the top of a high mountain in the area where the agricultural production cooperative is located. There is a full-time broadcaster, who is an excellent propagandist. The broadcaster promotes the central work, publicizes the general line, talks about current affairs, makes weather forecasts, commends good people and good deeds, and relays various notices from the county, district, and township. The 18 agricultural production cooperatives in Guanfeng Township have universally established Leap Forward command sheds. When the township issued a notice to "concentrate efforts to fertilize sweet potatoes," it immediately spread from one mountain to another, and spread throughout the township in less than 20 minutes. The broadcaster also looked out at the work of each production team from the top of the mountain. When they saw which team went to work early, was enthusiastic, and had neat work, they would broadcast praise; if a team went to work late, worked sparsely, and was not very enthusiastic, they would broadcast criticism. Every day, the broadcaster promptly broadcast the production situation of the day, such as how many mu of early rice was harvested, how many mu of late rice was planted, how many mu of cotton was trimmed, and how many mu of sweet potatoes were fertilized, so that every member of the commune could understand the entire commune's production situation. Therefore, it is deeply welcomed by the members of the commune. The members of the commune composed a allegro song to sing it: "Leap Forward shed, Leap Forward shed, there is a loudspeaker in the shed. Every household hears the broadcast, men and women, old and young, all go to work. Propaganda center talks about policies, arranges production without letting go. Promote the great leap forward in production, the Leap Forward shed is the first."
    The door bulletin board is a tool created by the broad masses of the county in the Great Leap Forward to carry out self-education. Its characteristic is to enable the Party's propaganda and ideological education to penetrate every household. Its form is very simple. Some people simply paste a red paper frame on the door panel and paste the three characters "Door Bulletin Board" written on red paper. Some people don't paste anything, just write the three characters "Door Bulletin Board" with chalk. After the County Party Committee decided to universally promote the door bulletin board in early May, it has now been universally established in all townships and communes. Almost every household in Renhe and Fengming Townships has a door bulletin board. The door bulletin board can simply and concisely promote the current central tasks of production, such as "A three-day blitz to plant sweet potatoes." It can also praise and criticize the head of the household. Feng Tiquan and Feng Xieshi, an elderly couple in their 60s in the Second Team of the Eleventh Commune of Renhe Township, worked actively in the summer harvest and summer planting, and the members of the commune wrote a door bulletin board to praise them: "Old man and old woman, over sixty years old, labor production is really good, never absent." A production team leader in this commune was not responsible for his work, and the members of the commune criticized him on the door bulletin board: "Cadre cadre, you have to say and do, if you only say and don't do, the members of the commune hate it." After being criticized, the team leader quickly corrected his shortcomings. Female commune member Pu Yufa, who is active in production and studies culture diligently, was praised by the club activists and propagandists on her family's door panel: "Production is the backbone, learning is the model, pick up the hoe to produce, pick up the pen to write and calculate."
    Because the door bulletin board has played a good role in various tasks and production, the masses composed a allegro to sing out their inner love: "Good door bulletin board, simple and clear. Current production matters, you can see it when you open the door. Praise and criticism, it's really well said. Ideology can be improved, and culture can also be learned. It doesn't cost a penny, and the harvest is really a lot."
    Due to the development of mass propaganda work, a lively and joyful scene of production has appeared everywhere in the rural areas of the county. Fields, mountains, construction sites, and courtyards are full of men and women singing. The masses composed a poem to sing their new life and their new countryside:
    The great leap forward in production, the atmosphere is new every day.
    Every commune has a club, and culture is full of the countryside.
    Every household has a door bulletin board, and every team reads the newspaper.
    Leap Forward sheds all over the mountains, broadcasting early and late.
    There are bulletin boards everywhere, and slogans fill the countryside.
    Songs are everywhere, and folk songs are touching.
    There is entertainment on the construction site, adding enthusiasm to labor.
    Everyone is literate, and every family reads.
    Both production and culture are harvested, with smiles on their faces and joy in their hearts.

    俱乐部  跃进棚  门板报
    ——介绍四川西充县农村宣传鼓动工作的三种好方式
    本报记者  余章瑞
    西充县位于四川省北部的丘陵地带。大跃进以来，这个县的农民干劲很大。全县已经改坡地为梯地二万二千亩，修建可通车子的道路四千五百多公里，已开工修建和已完工的水电站五十四座，扩大灌溉面积五万九千多亩。这个素有“苕国”之称的县，今年栽种的三十万八千亩红苕，现在普遍生长良好，平均亩产可达万斤，估计比去年增产五倍半。
    这些成绩的获得，主要是在党的领导下，农村整风运动取得彻底的胜利，广大农民群众充分发扬了革命干劲的结果。同时，也是与中共西充县委员会充分依靠群众进行思想政治教育工作和宣传鼓动工作分不开的。
    西充县农村宣传鼓动工作和文化娱乐工作很活跃。经常采取的宣传鼓动形式有二十五种，如俱乐部、跃进指挥棚、门板报、评比台、跃进报、光荣榜、喜鹊报、流动板报、田头鼓动牌等等。下面介绍的就是西充县农村俱乐部、跃进指挥棚和门板报。
    农村俱乐部是党在农村的重要的宣传阵地。全县一千一百七十七个农业生产合作社，基本上作到社社都有俱乐部。为了做到宣传鼓动与文娱活动相结合，使宣传形式多样、有趣，生动活泼，他们采取了以宣传网为核心、以宣传员为骨干、以俱乐部为阵地的办法，经常不断地向群众进行社会主义思想教育。全县有宣传员五万余人，俱乐部活动积极分子三万八千人，这两支队伍汇合成九万人的固定性的宣传大军。有力地宣传了党的政策，鼓舞了群众的革命干劲，推动了生产。
    仁和乡第十一、十二农业生产合作社俱乐部创造了“六到二讲二不讲”的工作方法。即“到田间，到山头，到工地，到院子，到处可以宣传，到处可以活动。”“只讲活动经常，不讲活动大小，只讲推动生产，不讲形式排场。”成为全县俱乐部的一面旗帜。虹溪乡三十一个农业生产合作社，三千七百四十户，一万七千余人，有二十二个俱乐部。这个乡的基本建设队俱乐部经常对来自三十一个社的四百七十六名队员进行思想教育。他们结合生产和队员思想状况，编了一百多首歌谣，写了宣传鼓动牌七十五个，发动群众写了二百六十多张大字报，举行三次月光晚会。在晚会上讲红军长征、丁佑君、黄继光等烈士的革命故事。业余剧团还演出刘介梅回头等戏曲。开始时俱乐部发现个别队员怕吃苦，工作劲头不大，俱乐部的活动分子就编了“一年辛苦十年甜，十年辛苦万年甜，现在跃进加油干，子孙幸福万万年”及“双手磨起千层茧，汗水冲开万重山，八化工作大跃进，社会主义早实现”等歌谣，对他们进行正面的宣传教育。当六中队团结好，生产好，并创造了用天秤吊土的方法，出席了基建队模范会后，俱乐部就送喜鹊报和喜报。上面写着：“六中队，成绩大，带动大家搞八化。天大困难都不怕，人人都把他们夸。出工走前头，收工走尾巴。团结搞得好，工作劲头大。技术常改进，创造开奇花。出席模范会，戴上光荣花。先进再先进，戴花再戴花。”这样一来，六中队干劲更高，干活有说有笑，提高了工效二倍，登了三次光荣榜。在六中队的带动下，一中队、十二中队也成了模范队。俱乐部还建立了跃进评比台，上面画着人骑火箭、坐飞机、火车、汽车、骑自行车、牛和猪。在每个项目下面写着队名、人名。红纸大字写着“赶上火车撵飞机，一定要把火箭追”两行大字。在各个项目下面分别写着诗句：“坐火箭顶呱呱，坐飞机人人夸，坐火车劲头大，坐汽车把油加，自行车没掉队，骑牛的展劲跑，骑猪的快快走。”跃进评比台对表扬先进、鼓励落后赶上先进起了很好的作用。由于俱乐部宣传鼓动工作作得好，队员的干劲一直很大。他们除进行改坡地为梯地、修建道路而外，还为烽火一社新建了九十幢楼房，一所水力发电站，建立了铁、木、竹、石灰、熬硝、砖瓦等六个工厂。队员们唱快板诗形容他们愉快劳动的情况：“歌声遍山岭，活动满工地，创作处处有，人人都欢喜。”
    西充县农村俱乐部能够这样紧密地结合生产中心进行宣传鼓动工作，是与中共西充县委会的领导分不开的。在去冬以前，俱乐部普遍存在重文娱轻宣传的倾向。一搞活动就是“穿袍挂须敲大锣”，群众把俱乐部叫作剧乐部。各个文化宣传业务部门下乡时，又是各自单线活动，互相争人争时间。县委会几次开会研究决定，各级党委书记必须亲自抓政治思想工作，领导俱乐部；各个文化宣传部门下乡进行工作时，必须互相协作，围绕俱乐部开展本身业务；坚决贯彻“小型多样，为政治服务，为生产服务”的方针。因此，随着农业生产大跃进，宣传鼓动工作也大大跃进了一步，反过来又推动了农业生产的跃进。
    跃进指挥棚（又称跃进棚）设立在农业生产合作社所在地区的高山顶上。设有专职广播员一人，由优秀的宣传员担任。广播员宣传中心工作，宣传总路线，讲时事，作气象预报，表扬好人好事，转播县、区、乡的各项通知。观凤乡十八个农业生产合作社，普遍设立了跃进指挥棚，乡里发出“集中力量进行红苕施肥”的通知，立即一个山头传一个山头，不到二十分钟就传遍了全乡。广播员还要在山顶上了望各个生产队的工作，看见那一队出工早，劲头大，活路整齐，就广播表扬；那一队出工晚，干活稀稀拉拉，劲头不大，就广播批评。广播员每天把当天的生产情况，如收了多少亩早稻，栽了多少亩晚稻，多少亩棉花整了枝，多少亩红苕施了肥，及时广播出去，让每个社员都了解整个社的生产情况。因此，深受社员的欢迎。社员编了一首快板歌唱它：“跃进棚，跃进棚，棚里有个广播筒。家家听见广播响，男女老少都出工。宣传中心讲政策，安排生产不放松。推动生产大跃进，先行就是跃进棚。”
    门板报是这个县的广大群众在大跃进中为进行自我教育创办起来的。它的特点是使党的宣传鼓动工作和思想教育工作深入到每家每户。它的形式很简单。有的在门板上面贴个红纸框框，贴上红纸写的“门板报”三个字就行。有的就什么也不贴，只用粉笔写上“门板报”三个字。5月初县委决定普遍推广门板报后，现在各乡社都已普遍建立。仁和、凤鸣各乡几乎每户都有门板报。门板报可以简单扼要地宣传当前生产中心任务，如“突击三天，栽完红苕”。也可以针对户主本人进行表扬和批评。仁和乡十一社二队六十多岁的冯体全、冯谢氏两夫妇，在夏收夏种中劳动积极，社员便给他们写门板报表扬：“老公公来老婆婆，年纪已有六十多，劳动生产真不错，从来没有缺勤过。”这个社有一个生产队长工作不负责，社员就在门板报上提出批评：“干部干部，要说要做，光说不做，社员厌恶。”经过批评后，这个队长很快就改正了自己的缺点。女社员蒲玉发，生产积极，学习文化努力，俱乐部的活动分子和宣传员就在她家的门板上进行表扬：“生产是骨干，学习是模范，拿起锄头会生产，拿起笔杆会写算。”
    由于门板报在各项工作和生产中起了很好的作用，群众编了一首快板唱出内心的喜爱：“好个门板报，简单又明了。当前生产事，开门就看到。表扬和批评，硬是说得好。思想能提高，文化也学了。不花一文钱，收获真不少。”
    由于开展了群众性的宣传鼓动工作，全县农村到处出现热热闹闹、欢欢喜喜搞生产的场面。田间、山头、工地、院旁到处都有男歌女唱。群众编了一首诗，歌唱他们的新生活，歌唱他们的新农村：
    生产大跃进，气象日日新。
    社社俱乐部，文化满乡村。
    户户门板报，队队读报声。
    遍山跃进棚，早晚广播声。
    到处是板报，标语满农村。
    歌声四处有，民歌动人心。
    工地有文娱，劳动添干劲。
    人人把字识，家家读书声。
    生产文化双丰收，笑在眉头喜在心。
