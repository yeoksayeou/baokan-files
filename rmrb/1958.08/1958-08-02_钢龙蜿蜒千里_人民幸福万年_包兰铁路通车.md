Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 1st: Today, more than 20,000 people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Yinchuan City braved the drizzle and held a grand rally at Yinchuan Station to celebrate the joining and opening of the Bao-Lan Railway.

After the rail joining ceremony was held at 9:00 a.m., the opening ribbon-cutting ceremony began. Amidst thunderous applause and cheers, Liu Geping cut the colored ribbon. At this moment, the signal to start the train was released into the sky above the station, and two north-south trains decorated with colored ribbons and huge portraits of Chairman Mao slowly started, heading south and north respectively.

Then, the grand celebration rally began amidst the sound of twenty-four salutes. At this time, people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Ningxia presented dozens of silk banners and local famous specialties such as jacquard woolen blankets, wolfberries, and yellow wine to the soldiers and workers who built the railway. On the presented silk banners, people used magnificent phrases such as "Showing skills in the old Ying-Xia, building extraordinary achievements in Bao-Lan today," "Crossing the Yellow River, leveling the sand dunes, heroes conquer the natural barriers," and "A thousand-mile steel dragon lies across, the people's happiness lasts ten thousand years" to praise the heroes who completed the Bao-Lan Railway, which crosses the Yellow River, grasslands, and vast deserts, five months ahead of schedule.

Liu Geping delivered a speech at the meeting. On behalf of the Party and government leading organs of Ningxia, he warmly congratulated the successful completion of the Bao-Lan Railway.

Hafungga, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who was invited to attend the meeting, also spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the nine million people of all ethnic groups in the region, he warmly congratulated the completion and opening of the Bao-Lan Railway.

He Huiyan, a Major General of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said in his speech at the meeting that today, at the time of the joining and opening of the Bao-Lan Railway, is precisely when the people of the whole country are vigorously implementing and realizing the Party's General Line, while the US-British imperialism is launching a war of aggression in the Middle East. Our railway soldiers must, together with the people of the whole country, hold high the red flag of the General Line, maintain high vigilance, continue to step up the construction of railways, and be ready at all times to smash the imperialist plots of aggression and contribute all our strength to defending world peace.

Also speaking at the meeting were the person in charge of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and representatives of workers and peasants from Yinchuan City.

The celebration rally concluded at 10:30 a.m. Afterwards, more than 3,500 Hui and Han people took trains in batches for a short trip on the grassland under the Helan Mountains.

Further dispatch: The Bao-Lan Railway, which has just been laid, began temporary operation on August 1st and started passenger and freight operations with the national railway network. Starting today, there will be passenger and freight trains running daily between Yinchuan and Lanzhou, and Yinchuan and Baotou.

The opening of this railway for operation immediately after its completion is an innovation of the employees of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps, breaking with convention. According to past practice, after a railway is completed, it takes about half a year or at least two or three months before it can be opened for operation due to the preparation of operating conditions and the installation of various equipment on the railway.

    钢龙蜿蜒千里　人民幸福万年
    包兰铁路通车
    据新华社银川1日电　今天银川市各族各界两万多人，冒着蒙蒙细雨，在银川车站举行了盛大的庆祝包兰铁路接轨通车大会。
    上午九时举行接轨仪式后，通车剪彩仪式开始。刘格平在雷动的掌声和欢呼声中剪断了彩绸。这时，车站上空放出开车信号，扎着彩绸挂着巨幅毛主席像的两列南北对开的列车，徐徐开动，分别向南、北驶去。
    接着，盛大的庆祝大会在二十四响礼炮声中开始了。这时，宁夏各族各界人民，把几十面锦旗和当地著名特产提花毛毯、枸杞、黄酒等，献给修建铁路的战士和职工。在赠送的锦旗上，人们用“昔日鹰厦显身手，今日包兰建奇功”、“跨黄河，踏平沙山，英雄通天堑”、“千里钢龙横卧，人民幸福万年”等壮丽词句，赞颂提前五个月修通跨越黄河、草原和大沙漠的包兰路的英雄们。
    刘格平在会上致词。他代表宁夏党、政领导机关，热烈祝贺包兰铁路胜利建成。
    应邀参加大会的内蒙古自治区副主席哈丰阿，也在会上讲了话。他代表中共内蒙古自治区委员会、内蒙古自治区人民委员会以及全区九百万各族人民，为包兰铁路的建成和通车热烈祝贺。
    中国人民解放军铁道兵少将何辉燕在会上讲话时说，今天在包兰铁路接轨通车的时候，正是全国人民轰轰烈烈执行和实现党的总路线的时候，而美英帝国主义却在中东发动侵略战争。我们铁道兵战士要和全国人民一起，高举总路线的红旗，保持高度警惕，继续加紧修筑铁路，随时准备粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋，为保卫世界和平贡献一切力量。
    在会上讲话的还有铁道部第一工程局的负责人和银川市工人和农民的代表。
    上午十时半庆祝大会宣告结束后，有三千五百多回汉族人民，分批乘坐上火车，在贺兰山下的草原上作了一次短途旅行。
    又讯　刚刚铺轨完毕的包兰铁路，8月1日就开始临时营业，并和全国铁路开办客、货营运。从今天开始，每日都有银川—兰州、银川—包头对开的客车和货车。
    这条铁路修通后接着就开办营运，这是铁道部第一工程局职工和铁道兵官兵，打破常规的一项创举。按照过去的常规，铁路修通以后，由于准备营运条件和安装铁路上的各种设备，半年左右或至少两三个月以上才能开办营运。（附图片）
