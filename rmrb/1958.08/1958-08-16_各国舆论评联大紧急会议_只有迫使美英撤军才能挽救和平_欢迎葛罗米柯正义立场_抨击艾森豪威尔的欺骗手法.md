Xinhua News Agency report: International public opinion, in commenting on the UN General Assembly Emergency Meeting, warmly welcomed Gromyko's speech, demanding that the UN force the immediate withdrawal of US and UK troops from the Middle East. Many newspapers also fiercely criticized Eisenhower's deceptive tactics attempting to conceal the crimes of aggression.

    Damascus "Al-Jamahir" said
    The American wolf wants to act as a kind-hearted monk
    Cairo's "Al Misaa" published an editorial on the 14th, stating that Eisenhower's plan at the UN General Assembly Emergency Meeting was an attempt to cover up the calls for the immediate withdrawal of US-UK imperialist troops from the Middle East.
    The newspaper pointed out that there is no other way to seek peace than the immediate withdrawal of US and UK troops from the Middle East. The newspaper said that the urgent problems in the Middle East are not "economic aid," monitoring radio stations, and dispatching UN "peace" forces.
    The newspaper concluded that the only proof provided by Eisenhower's speech on the 13th is that the United States has not changed its old policy of aggression.
    Damascus' "Al-Jamahir," commenting on Eisenhower's speech, said, "The current attitude of the United States is very similar to that of a wolf that once bared its fangs, but, not gaining anything from its prey, adopts deceptive means and tricks, attempting to disguise itself as a kind-hearted monk."
    Beirut's "Al Masaa" said
    All US troops must withdraw
    The Lebanese opposition newspaper Beirut "Al Masaa" criticized Eisenhower's speech at the UN General Assembly Emergency Meeting, saying, "Who is this doctor who stands up in a country ten thousand kilometers away from our country and appoints himself as able to cure our diseases and writes prescriptions for us from an imperialist pharmacy? We only complain about one disease, that is, the interference of this doctor himself and his colleagues in our internal affairs."
    The newspaper went on to criticize US military intervention, saying that the symbolic withdrawal of a battalion of troops "is like someone taking out a pistol and saying to you: I don't want to kill you with nine bullets, but only with seven or eight bullets."
    The newspaper demanded the immediate and complete withdrawal of US troops.
    India's "Free Press" said
    America's "troop withdrawal" is a ridiculous gesture
    Indian newspapers, in commenting on the UN Emergency Special Session, emphasized that US and UK troops should immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.
    The "Free Press" published an editorial on the 14th, stating that the US decision to withdraw a battalion of troops from Lebanon was a "laughable gesture."
    Delhi's newly published weekly "The Link" said on the 14th, "The crisis in West Asia cannot be eliminated unless the Western countries completely withdraw from West Asia." It said that after the Suez Canal incident, treating West Asia as a sphere of influence for the West "is a ridiculously clumsy diplomatic maneuver. The Americans and British must go home."
    Turkey's "Yeni Gazete" said
    The UN must guarantee the withdrawal of US and UK troops
    TASS Istanbul, August 14th: A commentator for the Turkish "Yeni Gazete," in an article commenting on the UN General Assembly Emergency Meeting, pointed out that in order to stabilize the situation in the Middle East, the UN must "guarantee the immediate withdrawal of British and American troops from Jordan and Lebanon." The commentator wrote: "The UN General Assembly should take measures at this emergency meeting to stop attempts by foreigners to interfere in the struggle of Arab countries for freedom and independence."
    Philippine "Manila Chronicle" said
    Eisenhower's plan is to control the Middle East
    The Philippine "Manila Chronicle" published an article on the 15th, pointing out that Eisenhower's so-called "Near East Peace Plan" presented at the UN General Assembly Emergency Meeting on the 13th is actually a plan for the West to control the Middle East. If the Arab countries accept this plan, they will never be able to escape the fate of colonies.

    各国舆论评联大紧急会议
　　只有迫使美英撤军才能挽救和平
　　欢迎葛罗米柯正义立场　抨击艾森豪威尔的欺骗手法
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论在评论联合国大会紧急会议时，热烈欢迎葛罗米柯的发言，要求联大迫使美英军队立即从中东撤退，许多报纸并猛烈地抨击艾森豪威尔的企图掩盖侵略罪行的欺骗手法。
    大马士革“群众报”说
    美国狼想扮成好心僧侣
    开罗“晚报”14日发表社论说，艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急会议上提出的计划是想掩盖要求美英帝国主义军队立即撤出中东的呼声。
    报纸指出，要觅致和平，除了立即从中东撤走美英军队以外没有任何其它办法。报纸说，中东的迫切问题不是“经济援助”、监督电台和派遣联合国“和平”部队。
    报纸最后说，艾森豪威尔13日的演说中所提供的唯一证明就是美国还没有改变它的侵略老政策。
    大马士革“群众报”在评论艾森豪威尔的演说时说，“美国目前的态度很像一头曾经一度张牙露齿了一个时候的狼，由于从猎获物那里没有得到什么东西，就采取欺骗手段和诡计，企图装扮成一个好心的僧侣。”
    贝鲁特“晚报”说
    美军必须全部撤退
    黎巴嫩反对派的报纸贝鲁特“晚报”抨击艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急会议上的演说时说，“在离开我们的国家一万公里以外的国家里站起来自封为能医治我们的疾病、并且从帝国主义药房里给我们开写药方，这个医生是甚么人呢？我们只抱怨一种疾病，那就是这位医生本人和他的同事们对我们内政的干涉”。
    这家报纸接着抨击美国的军事干涉说，象征性地撤出一营军队的做法“好像是一个人拿出了手枪对你说：我不想用九颗子弹打死你，而只想用七颗或八颗子弹打死你一样”。
    这家报纸要求美军立即全部撤退。
    印度“自由新闻”说
    美国“撤军”是可笑的姿态
    印度报纸在评论联合国紧急特别会议时，着重指出美英军队应当立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    “自由新闻”14日发表社论说，美国关于从黎巴嫩撤出一营军队的决定是“可笑的姿态”。
    德里新出版的“环节”周刊14日说，“如果西方国家不彻底退出西亚，西亚危机是不能消除的”。它说，在经历了苏伊士运河事件以后，把西亚当作西方的势力范围的做法，“是荒唐可笑的拙劣的外交手段。美国人和英国人必须回老家去。”
    土耳其“新报”说
    联大必须保证美英撤军
    塔斯社伊斯坦布尔14日讯：土耳其“新报”评论员在评论联合国大会紧急会议的文章中指出，为了稳定中东地区局势，联合国必须“保证英美军队立即撤出约旦和黎巴嫩”。评论员写道：“联合国大会应当在这次紧急会议上采取措施，制止外国人干涉阿拉伯国家争取自由和独立的斗争的企图”。
    菲“马尼拉纪事报”说
　　艾森豪威尔计划是要控制中东
    菲律宾“马尼拉纪事报”15日发表文章指出，艾森豪威尔13日在联合国大会紧急会议上提出的所谓“近东和平计划”，实际上是一个西方控制中东的计划。如果阿拉伯国家接受这个计划，他们将永远不能摆脱殖民地的命运。
