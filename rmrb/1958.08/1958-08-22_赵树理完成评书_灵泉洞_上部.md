　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st. Zhao Shuli's newly created long-form storytelling (Ping Shu) "Spirit Spring Cave" Part 1 has been completed and will begin serialization in the August issue of "Quyi" (Folk Arts) on the 24th.

　　The first part of "Spirit Spring Cave" describes the life-and-death struggle of people in a mountain area against the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops during the Anti-Japanese War. The second part describes the various changes that have taken place as the people in the mountain area embarked on the socialist road after liberation. The entire book is about 300,000 words long.

　　In the first part of "Spirit Spring Cave", Zhao Shuli used more storytelling techniques than when he wrote novels in the past, but he did not stick to the inherent format of storytelling. This is a new effort on his part to make his works more popular and accessible to the masses. Zhao Shuli once said: If my book can be told by the vast number of artists, this would be a great satisfaction to me.

　　赵树理完成评书“灵泉洞”上部
    新华社21日讯  赵树理新创作的长篇评书“灵泉洞”上部已经写成，将在24日出版的“曲艺”8月号上开始连载。
      “灵泉洞”的上部描写抗日战争时期一个山区的人民同日寇和蒋匪军的生死斗争，下部描写山区人民在解放后走上社会主义道路的种种变化。全书约三十万字。
    赵树理在“灵泉洞”上部，比他过去写小说时更多地运用了评书的手法，但又不拘泥于评书的固有格式，这是他在使作品更加通俗化群众化方面的新的努力。赵树理曾经说：如果我的书能让广大艺人们去说，这将是我很大的满足。
