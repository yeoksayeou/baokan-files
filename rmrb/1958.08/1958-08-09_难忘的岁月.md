	"Unforgettable Years"
	The four-act play "Unforgettable Years," performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre, depicts the underground struggle of the Party in Shanghai from 1931 to 1935. This play vividly portrays the different paths taken by educated youths under the white terror in those difficult years. Through sharp struggles against the enemy and struggles within the Party against erroneous lines, it reveals the noble qualities of communists who worked hard, sacrificed heroically, and dedicated everything to the Party.

    “难忘的岁月”
    北京人民艺术剧院演出的四幕话剧“难忘的岁月”，是描写1931——1935年党在上海的地下斗争的故事。这出戏生动地刻划了在过去苦难的岁月中，知识青年在白色恐怖下所经历的各种不同的道路，也通过尖锐的对敌斗争和党内对错误路线的斗争，揭示出共产党员那种艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、把一切献给党的高尚品质。  （任）
