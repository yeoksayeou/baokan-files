Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 25th: Meteorological stations in fifty locations in Guizhou Province have broken with superstition and adopted a combination of indigenous and modern methods to issue short-term weather forecasts for their counties and regions, achieving remarkable results. Statistics show that the average forecast accuracy rate has reached 84.5%; the accuracy rate of meteorological stations and climate stations in twelve regions such as Jinsha, Rongjiang, Xishui, and Weining has even reached over 90%.

As early as 1953, some meteorological stations and climate stations in Guizhou Province had independently issued local short-term weather forecasts. However, at that time, some experts and engineers believed that there was no scientific basis for this, and they did not agree with doing so, which caused this work to come to a standstill. Since the beginning of this year, under the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, all parties have been eagerly requesting meteorological stations and climate stations to carry out local weather forecasts so as to grasp future weather changes and fight against natural disasters. With the active support of local Party committees and the masses, these fifty stations broke the mysterious view that "weather forecasting is unattainable" and boldly carried out forecasting work.

These meteorological stations and climate stations do not have experts or engineers, nor do they have any precise equipment, but only use a combination of indigenous and modern methods. They first mastered the local geographical conditions and local weather characteristics; at the same time, they widely collected local agricultural proverbs and weather proverbs, such as "Clouds move south, rain will gather; clouds move west, put on your raincoat," and "When tree leaves turn over and shake, heavy rain will flood the bridge," clarifying the laws of local climate change. On this basis, they listened to weather forecasts from meteorological stations in the province and other provinces, combined with the observed weather changes in their own regions, analyzed and researched them, and finally made weather forecasts for the next 24 hours in their regions.

Accurate weather forecasts play a huge role in helping mountainous areas overcome natural disasters and ensuring increased agricultural production. On June 22, after the Duyun Climate Station issued a forecast for moderate to heavy rain within the next 24 hours, Jiangzhou District and Mochong District promptly organized manpower to stay in the fields, so that all the expected rainfall was put to use, and most of the dry fields that were originally planned to be replanted due to drought were planted with seedlings. Zheng'an County had not had a thorough rain for nearly forty days from May 1 to June 8. After the meteorological station issued a rainfall forecast on June 9, 320,000 people in the county plunged into a rush to seize and store water. Although only 17.3 millimeters of rain fell that night, the county plowed more than 20,000 mu of dry fields overnight, and most of the dry ditches and dry ponds were also filled with water, ensuring full planting.

### 土洋结合预报天气  贵州各地气象站采用新方法成绩显著

　　土洋结合预报天气
    贵州各地气象站采用新方法成绩显著
    新华社贵阳25日电　贵州省五十个气象站和气候站破除迷信，采取土洋结合的办法，发布本县、本地区短期天气预报，已作出显著成绩。据统计，预报准确率平均达到84.5％；金沙、榕江、鰼水、威宁等十二个地区气象站和气候站的准确率还高达90％以上。
    贵州省有的气象站和气候站早在1953年就单独发布过本地短期天气预报。但当时由于一些专家和工程师认为没有科学根据，不同意这样做，便使这项工作停顿下来。今年以来，在工农业大跃进的形势下，各方面都迫切要求气象站和气候站把当地天气预报搞起来，以便掌握未来天气变化情况，向自然灾害作斗争。在各地党委和群众的积极支持下，这五十个站打破了“气象预报高不可攀”的神秘观点，大胆开展预报工作。
    这些气象站和气候站没有专家和工程师，也没有什么精确的设备，只是利用土洋结合的办法。他们首先掌握了当地的地理条件和地方性天气特点；同时广泛收集当地的农谚和天气谚语，如“云走南，雨成团；云走西，披蓑衣”、“树叶翻背摇，大雨淹过桥”等，明确了地方性气候变化的规律。在这样的基础上，再收听本省和外省气象台的天气预报，结合本地区观测到的天气变化情况，加以分析研究，最后作出本地区二十四小时内的天气预报。
    准确的天气预报，对帮助山区战胜自然灾害，保证农业增产起到巨大作用。6月22日，都匀气候站发布了未来二十四小时内有中雨到大雨的预报以后，江州区和墨冲区及时组织人力守在田间，使预期下降的雨全部发挥作用，把原来因旱灾准备改种的大部分干田栽上了秧。正安县5月1日到6月8日近四十天没下过透雨。6月9日，气象站发布降雨预报后，全县三十二万人民投入突击抢水、蓄水的行列，当晚虽只下十七点三公厘雨，可是全县却连夜犁出干田二万多亩，干沟和干塘也大部蓄满了水，保证了满栽满插。
