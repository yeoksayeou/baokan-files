One Night of Spring Breeze, Flowers Bloom All Over the Garden

    Editor's Note: In the process of popularizing primary and secondary schools in Jilin Province, the masses are full of enthusiasm and joy. A poem is widely circulated to describe this great and vivid scene.

    Combining education and labor well, work-study programs surge like tides;
    Going all out to strive for the upper reaches, competing with nature for higher achievements.
    Riding the wind and waves, whipping the horse faster, sweeping away right-leaning conservatism;
    Continuous revolution has a great future, and the red flag shines brightly throughout the campus.

    一夜春风　花开满园
    编者按：吉林省普及中小学的过程中，群众干劲十足，欢欣鼓舞，普遍流行着一首诗歌，形容这种伟大生动的场面。
    教育劳动结合好，勤工俭学似海潮；
    鼓足干劲争上游，来与天公比试高。
    乘风破浪猛加鞭，右倾保守一扫光；
    不断革命前途大，红旗光芒满校园。
