    Tightening the Noose of "U.S. Aid" for Arms Expansion and War Preparations
    The Turkish Economy on the Brink of Bankruptcy
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 4th: The United States recently decided to increase "economic aid" to the Turkish government to rescue the Turkish economy, which is on the verge of bankruptcy.

    According to the U.S. State Department's announcement on the 3rd, the total amount of this newly increased "aid" is 359 million U.S. dollars. Of this, 234 million U.S. dollars will be directly allocated to Turkey from U.S. "foreign aid appropriations," and the remainder will be provided by the "European Economic Cooperation Administration" and the International Monetary Fund.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, 2nd: According to TASS, Ankara, 1st: The Turkish government's economic policies are pushing the country to the brink of bankruptcy. This policy is causing increasing concern and dissatisfaction among Turkish business and political figures.

    As everyone knows, Turkey's foreign debt this year is over one billion U.S. dollars. According to Turkish economists, this huge debt will not be paid off until the year 2002.

    However, as can be seen from newspaper reports, the Turkish government, which has to spend a large amount of money on war preparations due to its participation in military aggression groups, still mainly relies on foreign financial "aid" to survive.

    The Turkish government's intention to accept new loans from Western countries has been criticized by many Turkish political activists. The statement by Yalcin, a member of the Guidance Committee of the "Liberal Party," is noteworthy. Yalcin said, "Loans obtained from abroad are not gifts. They seriously affect the balance of payments." He continued, "We are always reaching out to beg for foreign help, which proves that we are on an incorrect and dangerous path."

    Yalcin compared the Turkish economy to a torn burlap sack, believing that to make the Turkish economy healthy, "Turks must work hard themselves." He said, "To put things in this sack, we must first mend the holes in the sack. If we continue to pursue the previous financial policies, then even loans will be of no avail."

    Yalcin also mentioned that 42% of Turkey's exports are used to repay debts, and a total of 400 million lira were spent in this area in 1957. Yalcin said, "If anyone thinks that relying on foreign loans can solve all difficulties, then they will fall into painful despair in the near future."

### 套在“美援”绞索上扩军备战  土耳其经济濒于破产边缘

    套在“美援”绞索上扩军备战
    土耳其经济濒于破产边缘
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国最近决定增加给土耳其政府的“经济援助”，以挽救濒于破产的土耳其经济。
    据美国国务院3日宣布，这笔新增加的“援助”款项的总额是三亿五千九百万美元。其中二亿三千四百万美元将由美国的“援外拨款”中直接拨给土耳其，其余部分将由“欧洲经济合作局”和国际货币基金组织提供。
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社安卡拉1日讯：土耳其政府所实行的经济政策正在使这个国家濒于破产的边缘，这种政策引起了土耳其商业界和政界人士与日俱增的忧虑和不满。
    大家知道，今年土耳其的外债在十亿美元以上。据土耳其的经济学家计算，这笔巨额债务要到二千零二年才能付清。
    可是，从报纸报道中可以看出，由于参加军事侵略集团而不得不花费大笔资金备战的土耳其政府，今后仍然主要指望依靠外国财政“援助”过活。
    土耳其政府打算从西方国家接受新的贷款一事受到许多土耳其政治活动家的批评。“自由党”指导委员会委员雅尔钦的声明很值得注意。雅尔钦说：“从国外取得的贷款，这不是礼物。它们严重地影响了收支平衡”。他继续说：“我们总是伸出手来乞求外国的帮助，这证明我们处在不正确的、危险的道路上”。
    雅尔钦把土耳其的经济比作破麻袋，他认为，要使土耳其经济健康化，必须“土耳其人自己努力”。他说，“要在这个麻袋里装东西，首先必须要缝好麻袋上的破洞。如果我们依旧奉行以前的财政政策，那么即使贷款也无济于事”。
    雅尔钦还谈到，土耳其出口的42％是用来偿还债务，1957年一共在这方面花费了四亿里拉，雅尔钦说：“如果有人以为依靠外国贷款可以解决一切困难的话，那么他们在最近的将来将陷于痛苦的绝望中”。
