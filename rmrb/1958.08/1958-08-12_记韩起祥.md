　　Remembering Han Qixiang
　　Qu Yisu
    "Hailstones beat the walls, ice covers the houses,
    Aggressive wars won't last long.
    A lapdog wants to gnaw at the iron flagpole,
    A turtle in a well wants to eat the sun."
    This is Comrade Han Qixiang's new work, a vivid and profound mockery of the imperialist aggressors.
    People's wandering poet Comrade Han Qixiang, his pulse always beats with the people. His sonorous, ardent, and simple voice, paired with his rhythmic sanxian, rejoices in the people's joy and grieves in their suffering. His songs are the voice of the people.
    As early as the Anti-Japanese War, Han Qixiang continuously wrote new lyrics to inspire the fighting spirit of the soldiers and civilians. He once said, "The sanxian is my machine gun, storytelling is my bullet, and writing new stories is my arsenal." From July 1944 to December 1945, in just a year and a half, he created and adapted twenty-four new stories, totaling about two hundred thousand words.
    Han Qixiang grew up in the countryside, and his art is rooted in the countryside. He deeply loathed the feudal marriages that had been passed down for thousands of years in the countryside, and for this reason he wrote the famous "Liu Qiao's Reunion." In addition, he also wrote works such as "Wang Piqin's Journey to the South" and "The Great Victory of Yichuan." After the national liberation, he sang about the new life and the new era with even greater enthusiasm, creating more than hundreds and thousands of works. Because he has always drawn nourishment from the masses, his creative material is inexhaustible.
    He walked from township to township, village to village, with his sanxian. He worked alongside the commune members, and when they rested, he would play the sanxian and sing. He said, "Sing a lot during long breaks, sing a little during short breaks." Sometimes he would climb up a slope alone, use a clod of earth to prop up his small wooden box, and write down Braille characters, one by one, to create.
    When dark clouds rolled in 1957, and the rightists attacked the Party, Han Qixiang used his own life experience as the theme to write a passage called "The Story of Emancipation" with unparalleled angry passion. He started with the lives of the exploiters and the exploited:
    "The landlord's house has tile roofs and red lacquer doors,
    The hall is full of dazzling furniture,
    Wearing fur coats in winter and gauze in summer,
    The kang is covered with seven layers and eight layers.
    Our house is a cave,
    Covered with a kang mat to seal the cave roof,
    Yellow wormwood bundles block the door,
    The wind sweeps the yard, and the moon lights the lamp.
    The landlord's family eats steamed buns in the morning and cakes at noon,
    And picks up a noodle knife in the evening.
    Making pancakes, stir-frying eggs,
    Mutton meatballs with vermicelli.
    Our family of ten has only four bowls,
    The porridge is so thin you can see your reflection.
    In winter, we eat cornmeal buns mixed with bran,
    In snowy days, we use tree leaves and wild vegetables as food."
    This is the blood and tears history of half his life, a true and vivid portrayal of the microcosm of the Chinese countryside in the old society. It is an indictment of the old society. In the end of the work, he tells his own people:
      "Eat a mouthful of Coptis chinensis, eat a mouthful of sugar,
    We ourselves taste the sweetness after suffering,
    The days of the old society were bitterer than Coptis chinensis,
    Life in the new society is sweeter than sugar." He justly and forcefully denounces the rightists:
      "The rightists have black hearts,
    Spreading rumors and attacking the Party everywhere,
    A viper cannot stop the train.
    How can a lapdog swallow the sun."
    In 1958, the Great Leap Forward came, and Han Qixiang went to the water conservancy construction site. He went to the area where wells were being dug, wherever there was enthusiastic labor, there he was. Wherever he was, the work was even more joyous. Some old men said, "Listening to Lao Han's storytelling is like drinking four ounces of liquor!"
    Han Qixiang said, "Now we must use storytelling as a hoe!" His "hoe" is shaking every piece of land and inspiring people's confidence in moving towards socialism! In half a year, he has told stories for farmers four hundred and ten times. He not only frequently goes deep into the mountains, small villages, and fields to perform, but he also seizes the time for diligent creation. He performs wherever he goes, he labors wherever he goes, he writes about the new people and new things that appear wherever he labors, and he performs them in a timely manner.
    There was a Zhang Ziming at the Yangjialing water conservancy construction site who shoveled soil, doing the work of two people, so he sang:
    Zhang Ziming is a hero,
    The shovel handle is gripped tightly,
    Sweat flows to the back of his heels,
    Shoveling the loess like rolling waves.
    In Zhangjiazhuang, he saw the newly married couple Zhang Baosheng and Wang Guilian working energetically, so he sang:
    The young couple are digging a well,
    Just like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl,
    The Cowherd digs the soil, the Weaver Girl hoists it up,
    Digging a cornucopia from the ground.
    As a Communist Party member, Han Qixiang is very strict with himself. He engages in physical labor every day, he performs every day without interruption, he creates something every day, and he seizes every hour to study hard. He insists on reading the newspaper every day (read by others), he insists on listening to the radio news every day, and he insists on learning Braille, which he can now use.
    Lao Han receives many letters every day, some asking him to perform, some expressing condolences, and each letter gives him great encouragement. For a Communist Party member, what could be happier than being intertwined with the feelings of the people and gaining their trust? Recently, he wrote a new song, which includes the following passage:
    "It's a pity I'm blind and can't see,
    Cannot go to work together;
    Carry a sanxian up the mountains and down to the countryside,
    Tell a story to express my heart.
    You are fighting for heroes on the battlefield,
    I will write new stories and sing about new people.
    The relationship between artists and the people should be like this.

### 记韩起祥

　　记韩起祥
　　曲亦素
    “雹子打墙冰盖房，
    侵略战争不久长。
    哈巴狗想把铁旗杆啃，
    井里的乌龟想吃太阳。”
    这是韩起祥同志的新作，形象地、深刻地对帝国主义侵略者进行了无情的嘲笑。
    人民行吟诗人韩起祥同志，他的脉搏永远是和人民一起跳动的，他那高亢、热烈、淳朴的嗓音，配上那只音韵铿锵的三弦，为人民的欢乐而欢乐，为人民的悲苦而悲苦，他的歌唱正是人民的心声。
    远在抗日战争时期，韩起祥就不断地编写新词以激励抗日军民的斗志。他曾说过：“三弦就是我的机关枪，说书就是我的子弹，编写新书就是我的兵工厂。”从1944年7月到1945年12月，短短的一年半时间里，他就创作和改编了新书二十四篇，约二十多万字。
    韩起祥生长在农村，他的艺术生根在农村，农村中千百年所遗留下来的封建婚姻是他所深恶痛绝的，为此他写了著名的“刘巧团圆”。此外，他还曾写过“王丕勤走南路”、“宜川大胜利”等作品。全国解放了，他更加热情洋溢地歌颂起新的生活、新的时代，创作的作品不止千百首。因为他一直是从人民群众中汲取滋养，所以他的创作素材是取之不尽，用之不竭的。
    他带着三弦一乡一乡、一村一村地走着，社员干活他跟着干活，社员休息他就弹起三弦来唱。他说：“大休息大唱，小休息小唱。”有时他就一个人爬上坡，用土圪塔垫上他自己作的小木箱，一个字一个字地记上盲文字，搞创作。
    当1957年乌云乱滚，右派向党进攻的时候，韩起祥以无比愤怒的激情，以自己的身世为题材写了个段子“翻身记”，他从剥削者与被剥削者的生活写起：
    “地主家堂屋瓦房红漆门，
    满堂家具耀眼明，
    冬穿皮袄夏穿纱，
    炕上是铺着七层盖八层。
    我们家住的房子是窟窿，
    铺着炕皮盖窑顶，
    黄蒿捆子把门堵，
    风扫院子月点灯。
    地主家早起吃馍晌午糕，
    到晚上拿起切面刀。
    烙烙饼，炒鸡蛋，
    羊肉丸子细粉条。
    我们家十口人只有四个碗，
    吃的粥能照见人影影。
    冬天吃粗糠窝窝掺揃皮，
    到雪天树叶野菜当饭用。
    这是他半生中的血泪史，真实、生动地勾画出旧社会的中国农村的缩影。这是一篇对旧社会的控诉书。在作品的最后，他告诉自己人：
      “吃一口黄连吃一口糖，
    苦尽甘来咱们自己尝，
    旧社会的日子比黄连苦，
    新社会的生活甜如糖。”他理直气壮地痛斥右派：
      “右派分子黑心肠，
    到处造谣攻击党，
    毒蛇挡不住火车的路。
    哈巴狗安能吞太阳。”
    1958年大跃进来了，韩起祥到水利工地，他到挖旱井的地段，哪里有热火朝天的劳动，哪里就有他。哪里有他，哪里就干得更欢。有的老汉说：“听老韩说书，顶上喝四两酒！”
    韩起祥说：“现在要把说书当镢头！”他这把“镢头”震动着每一块土地，也振奋着人们向着社会主义迈进的信心！半年中，他已经为农民说书四百一十一次。他不仅经常的深入到深山、小村、田埂进行演唱，同时他还抓紧时间进行辛勤的创作。他在哪里演出，就在哪里劳动，他在哪里劳动，就随时编写哪里出现的新人新事，并及时地演唱。
    杨家岭水利工地上有个张子明，铲土时一个人顶两个，他就唱：
    张子明，是英雄，
    铁锹把，攥得紧，
    汗珠流到脚后跟，
    铲得黄土像波滚。
    他在张家庄看见张宝生、王贵莲这对新婚夫妇干活干得有劲，他就唱道：
    小俩口，打旱井，
    真像牛郎织女星，
    牛郎掏土织女吊，
    地下挖出个聚宝盆。
    作为共产党员的韩起祥，对于自己的要求非常严格。他每天都要从事体力劳动，他每天都要不间断地进行演唱，他每天都要搞搞创作，他每一个小时都要抓紧时间进行顽强的学习。他坚持每天读报（由别人代读），他坚持每天听广播新闻，他坚持学习盲文，现在已经会运用了。
    老韩每天都要收到很多信，这些信有的是要求他去演出，有的是对他表示慰问，每一封信都给了他极大的鼓舞。对于一个共产党员来说，有什么事比得上与人民的感情交结在一起，取得了人民信任更快乐呢？最近他写了一篇新的唱词，其中有这样一段：
    “可惜我双目失明看不见，
    不能一起去劳动；
    背上个三弦上山下乡，
    说一段书来表一表心。
    你们在战场上争英雄，
    我就要编出新书唱新人。
    艺术家和人民群众的关系，就应当是这样的。
