Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 29th: Workers at more than ten rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) are working hard, striving for a great victory in steel production this year to support the national industry, especially the machinery and steel industries, in achieving leap forward targets.

Currently, a crucial key to increasing steel output and achieving the leap forward plan is to significantly improve primary rolling capacity. Facing the various weak links in production, workers at the primary rolling mill have formulated twenty-one major measures to improve rolling capacity, assigning specific personnel to be responsible for their completion within a specified time. A few days ago, workers in rolling section Group B innovated rolling technology, reducing the number of passes for rolling a steel ingot from thirteen to eleven. After this new improvement was promoted in three shifts, monthly steel billet production increased by 4,000 tons.

Workers at the large rolling mill, which is responsible for supplying large steel products to national railways and basic construction departments, are also trying every possible means to strive to complete the leap forward plan of increasing production by 150,000 tons of large steel products. According to the insufficient equipment situation, the equipment system workers built a hot cutting saw with indigenous methods, which will be installed soon. Technicians and workers in the heating furnace worked together to improve the ventilation and heating angle, so that a furnace that could only heat 120 steel billets in eight hours could now heat an additional 100 billets.

The seamless steel tube plant, which had a relatively good performance in completing the leap forward plan from January to July this year, is facing some difficulties in completing this year’s leap forward plan because two sets of small tube rolling mills currently in production were taken out to support the southwest region. However, the workers decided to vigorously develop small-scale equipment and improve the process to ensure the completion of this year's leap forward plan with reduced equipment. At present, they are collecting scrap materials and preparing to launch an all-out effort to trial-produce two more sets of small tube rolling mills.

### 支持机械工业和钢铁工业快马飞奔  鞍钢各轧钢厂狠狠增产钢材

　　支持机械工业和钢铁工业快马飞奔
    鞍钢各轧钢厂狠狠增产钢材
    据新华社鞍山29日电　鞍钢十多个轧钢厂的职工正在大干苦干，力争今年钢材生产大获全胜，支援全国工业特别是机械和钢铁工业实现跃进指标。
    目前增加钢材产量、实现跃进计划的一个重要关键，是大大提高初轧能力。初轧厂的职工针对生产中的各种薄弱环节，制定了二十一项提高轧制能力的重大措施，并且责成专人负责，限期完成。前几天轧钢工段乙班工人革新了轧制技术，把原来轧一块钢锭由轧十三次缩短为十一次。这一新的改进在三个班推广后，每月可增产钢坯四千吨。
    担负着供应全国铁路和基本建设等部门大型钢材任务的大型轧钢厂职工，也在千方百计地争取完成增产十五万吨大型钢材的跃进计划。设备系统的职工根据设备不足的情况，自己动手用土办法制造了一台热切锯，不久就可以安装。加热炉上的技术人员和工人一起合作，改进了通风和加热的角度，使一座八小时只能加热一百二十根钢坯的炉子多烧了一百根。
    从今年1月到7月完成跃进计划较好的无缝钢管厂，由于8月份有两套正在生产的小型轧管机拿出支援西南地区，完成今年跃进计划有些困难；但是职工们决定大搞小型设备、改进工艺过程，保证在减少设备的情况下完成今年的跃进计划。目前他们正在收集废旧材料，准备再突击试制两套小型轧管机。
