Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 31st. According to reports received here, the Lebanese parliament held a meeting this morning and elected the current Army Commander-in-Chief, Shehab, as the next president. During today's election, security around the parliament was extremely tight, with barbed wire set up around the perimeter and many armored vehicles stationed nearby. Even armed soldiers were stationed on the roofs of nearby buildings.

This election was directed single-handedly by Murphy, the American President's "Special Political Representative" and conspirator, under the occupation of the American aggressor troops.

Lebanon's unicameral parliament has a total of sixty-six members, but only fifty-six attended the meeting today. In the first round of voting, Shehab only received forty-three votes, short of the two-thirds majority required for election. According to the Lebanese constitution, if no candidate is elected in the first round of voting, a second round is held, in which a candidate only needs to obtain a majority of the votes to be elected. Shehab was elected in the second round of voting with forty-eight votes. (Attached picture)

    墨菲导演黎巴嫩选举剧
    黎陆军总司令谢哈布当选下届总统
    新华社大马士革31日电　据这里得到的消息说，黎巴嫩议会今天上午举行了会议，并且选出现任陆军总司令谢哈布为下届总统。今天选举时，议会附近戒备森严，周围设置了铁丝网，停着许多装甲车，连附近屋顶上也站着武装士兵。
    这次选举是在美国侵略军占领下，由美国总统“特别政治代表”、阴谋家墨菲一手导演的。
    黎巴嫩一院制的议会共有六十六名议员，今天出席会议的只有五十六人。在第一次投票中，谢哈布只获得四十三票，不够当选所必需的三分之二多数。根据黎巴嫩宪法，如在第一次投票中没有候选人当选，就举行第二次投票，在第二次投票中，候选人只要获得过半数选票即可当选。谢哈布是在第二次投票中获得四十八票当选的。（附图片）
