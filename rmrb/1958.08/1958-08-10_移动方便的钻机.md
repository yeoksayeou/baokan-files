Easily Movable Drilling Rig

    Employees of the Repair and Assembly Division of the Second Team of the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Department Exploration Team recently manufactured a drilling rig that is easy to move and can drill to a depth of 300 meters. The employees call it the Mobile Type 300 drilling rig. It can also be used as a tractor, driving four or five double-share plows for farming, and can also be used for well drilling, water pumping for irrigation, and power generation for lighting.

    The drilling rigs used by this exploration team in the past had to be disassembled, carried by one or twenty people, and then reassembled each time the work site was moved, which took one to three days. It is much more convenient to use the Mobile Type 300 drilling rig, as it only requires one driver to operate and can travel at eight kilometers per hour, and can also climb slopes of forty degrees. Old-fashioned drilling rigs required four or five people to operate, while the Mobile Type 300 drilling rig only requires two people.

    This drilling rig was manufactured by Cao Shubai, Deputy Chief of the Repair and Assembly Division of the Second Team of the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Department Exploration Team, together with workers in more than twenty days of hard work at the Yanshan Reservoir construction site.

    移动方便的钻机
    河南省水利厅勘探队第二队修配股职工，不久以前制造了一台移动方便、能钻深三百公尺的钻机。职工们叫它做移动式三○○型钻机。它还能当作拖拉机，带动四、五部双铧犁耕地，也能凿井、抽水灌溉和发电照明。
    这个勘探队过去使用的钻机，每移动一次工作地点，需要拆卸开来，由一、二十个人抬运，然后又重新安装才能工作，要费一天到三天时间。使用移动式三○○型钻机就方便多了，它只需一个司机开动就能行走，每小时行八公里，还能爬过四十度的斜坡。旧式钻机需要四、五个人操作，而移动式三○○型钻机只需两个人。
