Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th - According to a report from the Czechoslovak State Statistical Bureau, Czechoslovakia achieved remarkable success in national economic development in the first half of this year. The total industrial output plan was fulfilled by 103%, and industrial output increased by 11% compared to the same period last year.

The achievement of these successes is mainly due to the widespread socialist competition launched across the country in the first half of the year in preparation for the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and the implementation of the measures taken by the Party and the government to improve the efficiency of the national economy. In the first half of this year, workers' labor productivity increased by 8% compared to the same period last year, and production costs were reduced by 0.5% as stipulated by the plan.

The various industrial sectors completed the plan very well. The fuel industry fulfilled 106% of the plan, the machine manufacturing industry - 104%, and the metallurgical and mining industry, and the chemical industry - 102%. Compared with the first half of last year, hard coal increased by 7%, lignite increased by 14%, electricity increased by 10%, gasoline increased by 22%, pig iron increased by about 100,000 tons, and steel increased by 125,000 tons.

In terms of basic construction, units with a power generation capacity of 50,000 kilowatts, 75,000 tons of hard coal, more than 1.8 million tons of lignite, and a production capacity of 24,000 tons of paper were put into production in the first half of the year.

The agricultural collectivization movement achieved new successes in the first half of the year. By the end of June, state-owned farms and cooperatives owned 72% of all agricultural land. The total number of agricultural cooperatives nationwide has reached 11,820.

In the first half of the year, residents purchased a total of 15,000 cars. On average, one refrigerator was purchased for every 17 households, one sewing machine for every 11 households, and one washing machine for every four households.

The volume of foreign trade in the first half of the year increased by 9.2% compared to last year, of which the trade volume with socialist countries increased by 15%.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th - In the first seven months of this year, 770 new agricultural cooperatives were established throughout Czechoslovakia. These new agricultural cooperatives included more than 40,800 farmers and more than 195,000 hectares of agricultural land. This figure is even higher than the figure for the same period last year, when the development of agricultural production cooperatives was at its fastest. In addition, many individual farmers joined existing agricultural cooperatives with large amounts of land. In the first seven months of this year alone, more than 78,000 farmers joined existing cooperatives. They brought a total of more than 311,000 hectares of land into the cooperatives.

By the end of July, the total number of agricultural cooperatives nationwide had reached 11,870, and more than 72% of the country's agricultural land belonged to the socialist sector.

In the Slovak region, 264 new agricultural cooperatives were established in seven months, and the land owned by the socialist sector in the region has grown to 63.2%. (Attached photo)

    捷上半年经济发展成就显著
    社会主义农业已拥有总耕地的72％
    工业总产量比去年同期增加了11％
    新华社布拉格6日电  根据捷克斯洛伐克国家统计局的报告，捷克斯洛伐克今年上半年的国民经济发展取得了显著的成就。工业总产量计划完成了103％，工业产量比去年同期增加了11％。
    这些成就的取得主要是由于今年上半年为迎接捷共第十一次代表大会而在全国展开了广泛的社会主义竞赛和实行了党和政府在提高国民经济效能方面所采取的措施。今年上半年工人的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了8％，生产成本比计划规定的降低了0.5％。
    各工业部门完成计划的情况很好。燃料工业完成了计划的106％，机器制造业——104％，冶金和采矿工业、化学工业——102％。和去年上半年比较，硬煤增加了7％，褐煤增加了14％，电力增加了10％，汽油增加了22％，生铁增加了十万吨左右，钢增加了十二万五千吨。
    在基本建设方面，上半年投入生产的单位有五万瓩的发电能力、七万五千吨硬煤、一百八十万吨以上的褐煤和二万四千吨纸的生产能力。
    农业合作化运动在上半年取得了新的成就。到6月底为止，国营农场和合作社拥有的土地已经占全部农业土地的72％。全国农业合作社的总数已经达到了一万一千八百二十个。
    上半年居民共购买了一万五千辆小汽车。平均每十七户购买了一个冰箱、每十一户购买了一架缝纫机，每四户购买了一架洗衣机。
    上半年的对外贸易额比去年增加了9.2％，其中同社会主义国家的贸易额增加了15％。
    新华社布拉格8日电  在今年的头七个月中，捷克斯洛伐克全国又新成立了七百七十个农业合作社。这些新的农业合作社包括有四万零八百多个农民和十九万五千多公顷的农业土地。这个数字比农业生产合作社发展最快的去年同期的数字还多。另外，有许多个体农民带着大量土地加入了原有的农业合作社。单在今年头七个月中，加入原有合作社的农民就有七万八千多个。他们带进合作社的土地共有三十一万一千多公顷。
    到7月底为止，全国的农业合作社总数已经达一万一千八百七十个，全国72％以上的农业土地都属于社会主义部分。
    在斯洛伐克地区，七个月中新成立的农业合作社有二百六十四个，该地区社会主义部分拥有的土地已经增长到63.2％。（附图片）
