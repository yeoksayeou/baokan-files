    One of the major bridges on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway trunk line—the Zhanghe River Bridge—has been successfully completed one hundred days ahead of schedule. The completion of this double-track bridge, which is more than 568 meters long, allows each passing train to bypass a five-kilometer bend compared to the old bridge.

    The foundation project of the Zhanghe River Bridge was constructed using a forced sinking method with large pipe piles of 3.6 meters in diameter. The diameter of these large pipe piles is 2.05 meters larger than the pipe piles used for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The success of the 3.6-meter large pipe pile forced sinking method is a further application and development of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge's pipe pile drilling method. Now, the China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Bureau has decided to further adopt large pipe piles with a diameter of 5.8 meters as the foundation for the Gan River Bridge project in Nanchang.

    京广线上的新大桥
    京广铁路干线上的特大桥之一——漳河桥，比原计划完工期限提前一百天胜利建成了。这座长达五百六十八公尺多的双轨桥梁的落成，使来往的每一趟火车都比走原来的老桥少绕了一段五公里弯道的路程。
    漳河大桥的基础工程，是用三点六公尺直径的大型管柱强迫下沉法施工的，这种大型管柱比武汉长江大桥所用的管柱的直径大了二点零五公尺。三点六公尺大型管柱强迫下沉法的成功，是武汉长江大桥管柱钻孔法的进一步运用和发展。现在，铁道部大桥工程局又决定在南昌赣江大桥工程上，进一步采用五点八公尺直径的大型管柱作基础。
