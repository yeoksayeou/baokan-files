Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: Today, the shipbuilding workers from Dalian and Shanghai sailed seven ships they had rapidly built during the Great Leap Forward and held a historically significant grand meeting on the vast Yangtze River estuary outside the mouth of the Wusong River.

　　Outside the mouth of the Wusong River, a gentle breeze stirred, and sunlight shone through the clouds, illuminating the river surface with fish-scale-like glimmers. In this place where imperialist warships once congregated, a grand review of the shipbuilding industry of New China was held today.

　　In the morning, the two 5,000-ton freighters, "Peace No. 25" from Dalian Shipyard and "Peace No. 28" from Jiangnan Shipyard, which had engaged in a fierce competition over shipbuilding cycle times, victoriously met. Also participating in the meeting were the "Democracy No. 14" passenger-cargo ship and "Hangong No. 3" tugboat, completed ahead of schedule by Hudong Shipyard, as well as the "Jiangrong" passenger ship and escort tugboat from Jiangnan Shipyard.

　　At 11:30, when the ships from the two locations converged outside the mouth of the Wusong River, the ships sounded their horns in unison, drums and gongs resounded, and they raised flags to salute each other. The shipbuilding workers on board cheered, applauded, and waved enthusiastically to congratulate each other. A large number of colorful balloons, peace doves, and glittering fireworks were released from the ships.

　　The ships that met today were all rapidly built by workers in Dalian and Shanghai shipyards during the Great Leap Forward. During the construction period, Dalian and Jiangnan Shipyards launched a heated friendly competition to complete the 5,000-ton freighter ahead of schedule, greatly shortening the shipbuilding cycle. Jiangnan Shipyard's "Peace No. 28" was completed thirteen months ahead of schedule, and Dalian Shipyard's "Peace No. 25" was completed eight months ahead of schedule. Hudong Shipyard, which later joined the competition, also shortened the construction time of "Democracy No. 14" by four months.

　　In this extraordinary competition, the three factories were both competitors and collaborators. Jiangnan and Dalian Shipyards, which were building the same type of freighter, divided the work of manufacturing some of the ship's machinery, and in the competition, they both gave the machinery they made first and of the best quality to the other party. Hudong Shipyard's employees overcame many difficulties and manufactured two 2,400-horsepower main engines for the two freighters. More than one or two hundred cooperative factories across the country also rushed to work and delivered goods ahead of schedule in order to support this great competition in the shipbuilding industry.

　　Representatives from more than one hundred cooperative factories and representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai also participated in the meeting.

　　At 11:45, the meeting ceremony ended, and the passenger ships and main ships, led by Jiangnan Shipyard's "Jiangrong" ship, sailed into the Huangpu River in a grand procession. Many ships anchored on both sides of the Huangpu River sounded their horns to express their congratulations. Hundreds of thousands of citizens on both sides of the Huangpu River flocked to the riverbank to watch the parade of ships decorated with colorful flags. The cheerful music of "Socialism is Good" played on the ships merged with the cheers of the people on the shore. The meeting parade ended at 4:00 p.m. (Attached Picture)

　　和平海轮争上游  吴淞口外大会师
    据新华社上海26日电　今天，大连和上海两地的造船工人驾着他们在大跃进中快速建成的七艘轮船，在吴淞口外辽阔的长江口江面上举行了一次具有历史意义的大会师。
    吴淞口外，微风轻拂，阳光透过云层普照江面泛起了鱼鳞般的光芒。在这过去是帝国主义军舰云集的地方，今天举行了新中国造船工业的大检阅。
    上午，大连造船厂和江南造船厂在造船周期上展开热烈竞赛的两艘载重量五千吨的海轮“和平二十五号”和“和平二十八号”胜利会师了。同时参加会师的还有沪东造船厂提前建成的“民主十四号”客货轮、“航工三号”拖轮，江南造船厂的“江蓉”号客轮和护航拖轮等。
    十一时半，当两地的轮船在吴淞口外会合的时候，各船汽笛齐鸣，锣鼓喧天，相互升旗致敬。双方船上的造船工人尽情地欢呼鼓掌、挥手祝贺。船上放出了大批彩色气球、和平鸽和金光闪闪的礼花。
    今天会师的轮船，都是大连、上海两地船厂工人在大跃进中快速建成的。建造期中，大连和江南造船厂为提前建成五千吨海轮，展开了一场热烈的友谊竞赛，使造船周期大大缩短。江南厂的“和平二十八号”比计划缩短十三个月，大连厂的“和平二十五号”比计划缩短八个月。后来参加竞赛的沪东造船厂，也把“民主十四号”建造时间缩短四个月。
    三个厂在这场不平凡的竞赛中，是竞赛的对手，又是协作的对象。建造同样型号海轮的江南和大连两厂，彼此分工制造一部分船上的机械，竞赛中，他们都把最先做成的、质量最好的机械交给对方。沪东造船厂职工克服了许多困难，为两艘海轮制造了两千四百马力的主机。全国还有一二百个协作工厂，为了支持这场造船工业的大竞赛，也都突击赶工，纷纷提前交货。
    参加会师大会的还有一百多个协作工厂的代表和上海各界代表。
    十一时三刻，会师仪式完毕，客船和主船以江南厂的“江蓉”轮领先，浩浩荡荡驶入黄浦江。停泊在黄浦江两岸的许多船只，都鸣放汽笛，表示祝贺。黄浦江两岸成千上万的市民都涌到江边，观看挂满彩旗的轮船大游行。船上起奏的“社会主义好”的轻快乐曲，同岸上人们的欢呼声汇成一片。会师游行到下午四时结束。（附图片）
