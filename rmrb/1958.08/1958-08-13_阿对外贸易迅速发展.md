　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 12th: Albania's foreign trade has developed particularly rapidly in recent years. In 1957, the volume of foreign trade increased by 41.9% compared to 1956, and in the first half of this year, it increased by 24.9% compared to the same period last year.
　　In Albania's foreign trade, trade with socialist countries accounts for more than 90%. The Soviet Union has given Albania great help economically, providing it with a large amount of machinery and equipment. More than half of Albania's foreign trade is conducted with the Soviet Union.
　　The types of goods imported and exported by Albania have undergone tremendous changes in the era of the people's government. Before liberation, agricultural products dominated Albania's exports, and daily necessities were the main imports. Now, mining and petroleum industrial products occupy a major position in exports, while the vast majority of imports are industrial equipment, agricultural machinery, transportation vehicles, and other means of production.

　　阿对外贸易迅速发展
    据新华社地拉那12日电　阿尔巴尼亚的对外贸易近年来有特别迅速的发展。1957年对外贸易额比1956年增加了41.9％，今年上半年又比去年同期增加了24.9％。
    在阿尔巴尼亚的对外贸易中，同社会主义国家进行的贸易占90％以上。苏联在经济上给了阿尔巴尼亚以大力的帮助，它向阿尔巴尼亚提供了大量的机器和设备。阿尔巴尼亚的对外贸易有一半以上是同苏联进行的。
    阿尔巴尼亚进出口的货品种类在人民政权年代发生了巨大的变化。解放前，在阿尔巴尼亚的出口品中占统治地位的是农产品，进口的主要是日用品。现在，采矿和石油工业产品在出口中占主要地位，而输入的绝大部分是工业设备、农业机器、运输工具和其他生产资料。
