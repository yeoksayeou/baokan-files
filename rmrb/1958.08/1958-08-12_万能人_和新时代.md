　　"Renaissance Man" and the New Era
　　Lin Zhong
    Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative in Echeng, Hubei, is currently vigorously developing the "Renaissance Man" movement, requiring each member to learn several production techniques. This is very similar to the "all-rounder" movement in industry.
    Some time ago, we advocated "specialized teams," such as having several specialized construction teams, sideline production teams, and agricultural production teams in an agricultural cooperative. Now we are advocating one person with multiple skills, both worker and farmer. Is this a contradiction? On the surface, specialization and multiple skills are contradictory. But in actual work, they are unified and can complement each other. The historical change of scattered small-scale peasant economy uniting into a collective cooperative economy allows the peasant masses to implement finer divisions of labor in the production process, each contributing their strengths and making the most of their talents. This is one of the important advantages of the cooperative economy. Because the finer the division of labor, the easier it is for production technology to develop, and the easier it is to improve labor productivity. Therefore, the degree of social division of labor also marks the degree of social progress. However, even in the most progressive society, professional division of labor does not exclude the necessity of one person with multiple skills. If a car driver also knows how to repair cars, he will not be helpless when encountering accidents and damaged car parts on the road. If a farmer who grows crops also understands some techniques for manufacturing agricultural tools, he can make more contributions to the agricultural cooperative during his leisure time from farming. If a farmer who raises livestock has some veterinary knowledge, he will not lose livestock because the veterinarian cannot arrive in time when the livestock suddenly becomes ill. Workers on farms are extremely busy during the farming season, but they are idle after the farming season is over. If they learn some industrial and sideline techniques and businesses, it will be much more beneficial to the development of the farm economy.
    In addition, it must be estimated that with the development of science and technology, certain professional skills will often become useless. Track switchers at railway stations must do other things after the track switches are automated. In the future, when internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives are developed, some workers in the original steam locomotives who were in charge of adding coal will have to switch to other jobs. Technological development is getting faster and faster, and this situation will become more and more common. In agriculture, when mechanized farming develops, some farmers who are good at plowing will have to learn other things, and some ironworkers who make plows will also have to switch to manufacturing other things. This development and change is just like the development and change of human society, and it will never stop.
    In the old society, many old farmers also knew several crafts. This is because their lives were very difficult at that time. They could neither afford to hire workers to help them repair houses and build stoves, nor did they have the money to buy some simple and easy-to-make production and living materials. This forced them to learn some simple crafts other than agricultural production.
    In the new society, people have changed from slaves of life to masters of life, and the importance of learning multiple skills is completely different from the past. Today, learning multiple skills is to better fight against nature, to give fuller play to human intelligence, both for oneself and for the entire society. In a society with highly developed culture, under the conditions that the intelligence of all people is fully utilized, no one can only drive a car, or only grow land, or only make a few agricultural tools, and spend their entire life in this way. The rapid development of the "Renaissance Man" movement in the Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative foreshadows the growth of "new people," the growth of a new society, and a new era—the era of communism—is beginning to emit red light like the morning sun.

### “万能人”和新时代

　　“万能人”和新时代
　　林中
    湖北鄂城旭光一社目前正在蓬勃地开展着“万能人”运动，要每个社员学会好些种生产技术。这和工业上的“多面手”运动很相像。
    前些时我们曾经提倡过“专业队”，比如在一个农业合作社里有若干专业的基建队，副业生产队和农业生产队，等等。现在又提倡一人多技，亦工亦农，这是不是矛盾呢？从外表看去，专业和多技是矛盾的。但是在实际工作中，却是统一的，可以互相补充的。分散的小农经济联合成为集体的合作经济这个历史性的变革，使得农民群众可以在生产过程中实行较细的分工，各献所长，人尽其才，这是合作经济的重要优越性之一。因为分工越细，生产的技术越容易发展，劳动生产率也就越容易提高。所以，社会分工的粗细，也就标志着社会进步的程度。但是，即使是在最进步的社会里，专业的分工也绝不排斥一人多技的必要性。开汽车的工人如果同时也会修理汽车，那就不至于在半路遇到事故、汽车零件损坏时束手无策。种庄稼的农民如果还懂得一些制造农具方面的技术，那他在农事的闲暇中就可以为农业社做出更多的贡献。饲养牲畜的农民如果有点兽医知识，那他在牲畜突然发病时就不致于因为兽医一时赶不到而损失牲畜。农场的工人在农忙季节忙得不可开交，农忙季节过了却又闲着没事做。如果他们学会工业和副业方面的一些技术和业务，那就对农场经济的发展有利得多。
    另外还必须估计到：随着科学技术的发展，某些专业技术往往会失去用处。铁路车站上的扳道岔工人在扳道岔自动化以后，他们就必须去干另外的事情。将来内燃机车和电气机车发达起来，原来蒸汽机车里的一些专管添煤的工人就不能不转而从事其他。技术的发展越来越快，这种情形也会越来越多。在农业方面，机耕发展起来，原来一些长于犁地的农民就不能不学习别的，一些制犁的铁业工人也不能不转而制造别的。这种发展变化正像人类社会的发展变化一样，是永远不会停止的。
    在旧社会，不少的老农民，他们也都会几种手艺。这是因为那时他们的生活很困难，既雇不起工人帮他们修房起灶，也没钱去购买某些简单易作的生产生活资料，这就逼使自己不得不都学会一些农业生产以外的简单手艺。
    在新社会，人们从生活的奴隶变成了生活的主人，学习多种本领的重要性，已同过去完全不一样了。今天，学习多种本领，是为了更好地向自然作斗争，更多地发挥人的聪明才智，既为着自身，也为着整个社会。在文化高度发达的社会里，在所有的人的聪明才智都充分发挥的条件下，任何人都决不可能仅仅会开汽车，或仅仅会种地，或仅仅会制造几种农具，以此度过自己的一生。旭光农业社的“万能人”运动能够迅速开展起来，就预示着“新人”在成长，新的社会在成长，新的时代——共产主义的时代，正像朝日一样开始在发射出红光。
