　　Further Improve Service Quality

　　On June 19th, your newspaper published Comrade Xiao Li's letter criticizing the ticket seller at our station for not caring about passengers, which is completely true. The main reason for the slow ticket sales on May 16th, which delayed passengers from boarding, is that we did not adequately educate our passenger transport staff. In the future, we will strengthen the ideological education of our staff and further improve the quality of service.

　  进一步提高服务质量
    6月19日，你报刊登肖立同志批评我站售票员不关心旅客的来信，完全属实。5月16日发生的售票员售票动作慢耽误旅客上车的事情，主要原因是我们对客运职工教育不够，今后我们一定加强职工的思想教育工作，进一步提高服务质量。
