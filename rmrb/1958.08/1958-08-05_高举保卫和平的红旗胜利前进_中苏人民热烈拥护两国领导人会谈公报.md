From airports to warships, from barracks to positions, the officers and soldiers of the three services unanimously believe with extreme excitement that this is a major measure to further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and consolidate world peace, and unanimously resolve to contribute everything they have to stop aggression and save peace. They seriously warn the warmongers: If they dare to provoke a war, the people of China and the Soviet Union and their armed forces will certainly, together with all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world, completely eliminate the aggressors from the earth!

    Yesterday afternoon, after hearing the full text of the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union from radios and loudspeakers, the troops stationed in Beijing, Wuhan, Shenyang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and other places immediately spread the news to each other.

The officers and soldiers unanimously expressed their warm support for this communiqué, and believed that the communiqué demonstrated the great and invincible power of Sino-Soviet unity, which would have a huge impact on safeguarding peace and easing international tensions. Zhang Rongheng, a first-class sharpshooter, said, "I warmly support the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet leaders' meeting, and I will definitely practice my marksmanship well, and be ready to aim and shoot at the aggressors at any time." Captain Zhao Dean of an air force unit, who shot down and damaged three American-made Chiang planes six days ago, and his comrades warmly discussed the great significance of this meeting during combat breaks, and unanimously resolved to defend peace with practical actions. Liang Fuyou, a comrade-in-arms of the internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, said, "Today, the people of China and the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of the world are together, and there are incomparably powerful armies, forming an iron and steel front. If the enemy dares to provoke a war, it will surely die without a burial place."
