Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 5th: A message from Santiago on the 3rd: Chilean President Ibáñez has promulgated the decision passed by the Congress to abolish the so-called "Law for the Defense of Democracy," which placed the Chilean Communist Party in an illegal position. This decision was submitted to the President for signature after being finally passed by a joint session of both houses of Congress on August 1st.

The abolition of the "Law for the Defense of Democracy," which will enable the Chilean Communist Party to exist legally and carry out public activities, is considered a victory for the long and arduous struggle of the Party and the democratic and progressive forces in Chile.

Under this law, which was enacted in 1948, the Chilean workers' movement and democratic parties, including the Communist Party, have been persecuted for ten years. During this period, the Chilean Communist Party and other patriotic and democratic forces waged an arduous struggle to abolish this reactionary law.

The abolition of the "Law for the Defense of Democracy" will enable the patriotic and democratic forces in Chile to launch a more vigorous election campaign in the presidential elections scheduled for September this year.

The right-wing parties in Chile are not reconciled to the abolition of this law. They tried to get the president to veto the decision and demanded that other legal means be taken to ban progressive political parties.

    智利人民的巨大胜利
    反动的“保卫民主法”被废除  共产党取得了合法存在地位
    新华社5日讯　圣地亚哥3日消息：智利总统伊巴涅斯颁布了国会通过的废除使智利共产党处于非法地位的所谓“保卫民主法”的决定。这项决定是在8月1日由国会两院联席会议最后通过后提交总统签署的。
    “保卫民主法”的废除将使智利共产党能够合法存在和进行公开活动，这被认为是党和智利民主进步力量长期艰巨斗争的一个胜利。
    在1948年制定的这项法律下，十年来智利的工人运动和包括共产党在内的民主党派一直遭受迫害。在这一期间，智利共产党和其他爱国民主力量曾经为争取废除这项反动法律进行了艰苦的奋斗。
    “保卫民主法”的废除将使智利爱国民主力量能够在定于今年9月举行的总统选举中，展开更有力的竞选活动。
    智利右翼党派不干心这项法律的废除，他们曾想使总统否决这个决定，并且要求采取其他法律手段来禁止进步政党。
