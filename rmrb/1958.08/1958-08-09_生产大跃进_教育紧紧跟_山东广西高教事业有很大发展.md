Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th: In the wake of the Great Leap Forward in production, education is closely following. Shandong Province has now established 34 new public institutions of higher education. In addition, over 80 people-run popular universities and "Red and Expert" universities are being planned, with some already open.

    The 34 public institutions of higher education were all established in accordance with the principles of education serving politics, education serving production, and the combination of education and labor. These schools include ten engineering colleges, eleven agricultural colleges, four medical colleges, six normal colleges, one physical education college, one art college, and one comprehensive university. Of these schools, fourteen are directly led by the province, and the rest are under the leadership of the municipal and regional party committees. In terms of the academic system, the specialized courses are generally two years, and new students who have graduated from junior high school study for four to five years; undergraduate courses vary from three to four years. All these schools are scheduled to open around September 15th.

    These newly established public universities will enroll approximately 10,000 students. In addition to recruiting 2,360 high school graduates, they will also admit on-the-job cadres, technicians, and agricultural cooperative members with a certain level of education and practical work and labor experience. Some schools will also recruit a portion of junior high school graduates with better qualifications for training.

    The vast majority of these public universities were established on the basis of the original secondary vocational schools, and they have a certain foundation in terms of cadres, teachers, school buildings, and equipment. In addition to promoting a group of teachers from the original secondary vocational schools, the original seven institutions of higher education have transferred more than 100 people to support the new schools without weakening their own teaching staff. Some of the graduates of this year's institutions of higher education will also be assigned to the new schools to serve as teachers. In addition, the relevant business departments and bureaus will also select some highly skilled technicians to serve as part-time professional course teachers. All schools are equipped with strong leading cadres. For example, the president and party committee secretary of Shandong Mechanical Industry College are concurrently held by Guo Youlin, deputy director of the Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry, and the president of Yantai University is concurrently held by Zhu Benzheng, the third secretary of Laiyang Regional Party Committee.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 8th: In the past two months, the number of public institutions of higher education in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has increased from the original three to fifty-seven. More than 14,400 new students will be enrolled in the second half of this year. Among these institutions, in addition to the original Agricultural College, Medical College, and Normal College run by the Autonomous Region, eight new institutions including Guangxi University, Forestry College, Metallurgical College, and Art College have been established. The special districts, cities, and counties have established a total of forty-six comprehensive universities and colleges specializing in industry, agriculture, medical health, and normal education.

    These institutions were all established in order to meet the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi for technological and cultural revolutions, based on the principle of diligence and thrift in running schools, and making full use of existing local equipment and manpower. The departments and teaching plans are set up according to the conditions of the region and the nature and number of cultural and technical cadres required. All colleges and universities will open factories and farms to implement the combination of theory and practice and cultivate working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

    In addition, the Liuzhou Railway Locomotive Depot and the Luocheng Coal and Sulfur Mine have established "Red and Expert" colleges themselves, and some townships in Guiping County have also established night universities, all of which have started classes. An agricultural university established by Jiashan Township in the suburbs of Guilin City has opened. It has six departments: agriculture, electrical engineering, chemical industry, meteorology, Chinese language, and health, and admits high school graduates from the township, production experts with junior high school education, and advanced producers with inventions and innovations.

    生产大跃进  教育紧紧跟
    山东广西高教事业有很大发展
    据新华社济南8日电  生产大跃进，教育紧紧跟，山东省现已新建公办高等学校三十四所，另有民办普及性大学和红专大学八十余所在筹建，有的已经开学。
    三十四所公办高等学校都是本着教育为政治服务、教育为生产服务、教育与劳动结合的方针办起来的。这些学校计有工科院校十所、农业院校十一所、医学院校四所、师范专科学校六所、体育、艺术院校各一所、综合大学一所。这些学校由省直接领导的十四所，其余都划归各市、地委领导。学制方面，专修科一般是二年，初中毕业的新生学习四年到五年；本科三、四年不等。这些学校都预定在9月15日前后开学。
    这些新建公办大学共招收学生一万人左右，除招收高中毕业生二千三百六十人外，还吸收具有一定文化水平、经过实际工作锻炼和劳动锻炼的在职干部、技术工人、农业社员入学；部分学校还招收一部分条件较好的初中毕业生进行培养。
    这些公办大学绝大多数是在原中等专业学校的基础上建立起来的，干部、师资、校舍、设备等方面都有一定的基础。师资除由原中等专业学校提拔一批外，原有七所高等学校在不削弱本身师资力量的情况下调出一百多人支援新建学校；本届高等学校毕业生也有一部分要到新建学校充任教师；此外，各有关业务厅、局还将挑选一些水平较高的技术人员兼任专业课。各学校都配备了较强的领导干部，如山东机械工业学院的院长、党委书记由省机械工业厅副厅长郭友邻兼任，烟台大学校长由莱阳地委第三书记朱本正兼任。
    新华社南宁8日电  近两个月来，广西僮族自治区公办的高等院校已由原来的三所增加到五十七所，今年下半年将招收一万四千四百多名新生入学。在这些院校中，自治区办的除原有的农学院、医学院和师范学院外，增办了广西大学、林学院、冶金专科学校、艺术专科学校等共八所。各专区、市、县所创办的综合性大学和工业、农业、医疗卫生、师范等大专学校共有四十六所。
    这些院校都是为了适应广西各族人民对技术革命和文化革命的要求，本勤俭办学的原则，充分利用当地原有设备和人力创办的；并根据本地区的条件和所需的文化、技术干部的性质和数量，来设置系科及制订教学计划。各院校都将开办工厂和农场，以贯彻理论联系实际，培养又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    另外，柳州铁路机务段、罗城煤硫矿职工自己办了红专学院，桂平县一些乡也办了夜大学，并都已先后上课了。桂林市郊区甲山乡办的一所农业大学已开学，它设置了农业、电机、化工、气象、语文、卫生六个系，吸收本乡的高中毕业生、具有初中毕业程度的生产能手和有发明创造的先进生产者入学。
