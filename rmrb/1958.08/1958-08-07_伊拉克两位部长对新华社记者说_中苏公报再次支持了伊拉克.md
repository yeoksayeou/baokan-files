    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 5th: Iraqi Republic's Minister of Development, Fadhel Rikaabi, told Xinhua reporters on the 5th, "The results of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China once again support our national cause and the cause of safeguarding world peace."

    Rikaabi said, "We believe that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have repeatedly helped and supported the Arab nationalist movement in its struggle against imperialism and its pursuit of freedom. We have always been grateful for this attitude."

    He said, "I think the People's Republic of China and its experience in building socialism are very useful to us. In the past, I very much wanted to visit your country, but the old regime would not even let me leave Iraq."

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 6th: Iraqi Minister of State Guidance, Shamshal, said in a separate meeting with Xinhua reporters on the 5th that the talks between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong in Beijing were important. The talks show that there must be real dangers in the world, and the talks are a contribution to world peace, and they are helpful to Iraq. He said, "You know, we are a peace-loving country, but some countries may have intentions of interference."

    When discussing his views on the relationship between Iraq and China, Shamshal said, "Let us leave this matter to Mao Zedong's wisdom to handle. You have recognized our country, and our country has reciprocated with recognition."

    Shamshal believes that the political, economic, and cultural relations between Iraq and China will expand. He said, "My first ideal is to visit China. I want to visit two countries—China and India. Because we have all suffered too much, we know what freedom means. I want to see the achievements of these countries."

    伊拉克两位部长对新华社记者说
    中苏公报再次支持了伊拉克
    据新华社巴格达5日电　伊拉克共和国开发部长法德·里卡比在5日对新华社记者发表谈话说，“苏联和中华人民共和国两国领导人的会谈结果又一次支持了我们的民族事业和维护世界和平的事业。”
    里卡比说，“我们认为苏联和中华人民共和国已经多次帮助和支持了阿拉伯民族主义这一方面来进行反对帝国主义的斗争和实现他们争取自由的渴望。我们对于这种态度一向是感激的。”
    他说，“我认为中华人民共和国和它的建设社会主义的经验对于我们非常有用。过去我很希望到你们的国家去访问，但是旧政权甚至不让我离开伊拉克。”
    新华社巴格达6日电　伊拉克国家指导部长尚沙尔5日在单独接见新华社记者时说，赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东在北京举行的会谈是一个重要的会谈。会谈表明世界上一定有真正的危险，会谈是对世界和平的一个贡献，它对伊拉克是有帮助的。他说，“你知道，我们是一个爱好和平的国家，但是有些国家可能有干涉的企图。”
    尚沙尔在谈到关于伊拉克同中国的关系的看法时说，“让我们把这个问题交给毛泽东的智慧去处理。你们承认了我国，而我国也报之以承认。”
    尚沙尔认为伊拉克和中国之间的政治、经济和文化的关系将会扩大。他说，“我的第一个理想就是访问中国。我想访问两个国家——中国和印度。因为我们都受过太多的苦难，我们知道自由意味着什么。我想去看看这些国家的成就。”
