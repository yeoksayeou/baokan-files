Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 2nd. The National Conference on Wheat Disease and Pest Control, held in Hefei, Anhui Province in late July, proposed a general plan for the national prevention and research of wheat diseases and pests. The plan requires taking all measures to basically eliminate wheat diseases and pests nationwide within three years through arduous struggle. Starting from the autumn sowing of wheat this year, immediate action will be taken to completely eliminate wheat nematode disease; eliminate three types of wheat smut and wheat stem sawfly before 1960, and basically eliminate the damage from wheat rust, Gibberella zeae, and wheat scab. Eliminate wheat blossom midge and underground pests by 1960.

The conference was hosted by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. At the meeting, ten typical experience reports summarized the prevention and research work on wheat diseases and pests in 1958 and earlier. These typical experience reports included: Anhui Province relied on the wisdom of the broad masses to use local pesticides on a large scale to prevent and control stem rust, winning a bumper harvest; Henan Province established mass-based insect pest forecasting stations (points) to control wheat blossom midge on a large scale, achieving a bumper harvest; the experimental research reports also introduced the experience of using 666 powder to treat the soil to eradicate wheat blossom midge, etc. At the meeting, these rich experiences from production practice were fully studied and summarized, and it was recommended that these experiences be vigorously promoted nationwide.

The National Conference on Wheat Disease and Pest Control implemented the spirit of focusing on practical results, and criticized the errors and shortcomings in the research route and research methods of agricultural scientific research in the past. By presenting facts and reasoning, it deeply criticized the idealist research viewpoint of "theory first, production second" that was divorced from reality; criticized the "varietal determinism" that believed that drug control could not solve the rust problem and could only rely on rust-resistant varieties; criticized the foreign-worshipping thought that only believed in "foreign" drugs and thought that "local" drugs were useless in drug use; criticized the superstition and right-leaning conservative thinking that believed that what was not in books and what foreign countries had not solved could not be solved, and not believing in the creativity of the masses, as well as bourgeois individualism such as pursuing fame and profit and not starting from the overall situation. Scientific workers realized that these ideas were important reasons for being divorced from the masses and production, causing agricultural science to lag far behind the situation, and were the main obstacles to the leap forward in agricultural science. At the meeting, in connection with the brilliant achievements made by the broad masses of farmers under the leadership of the Party in disease and pest control work this year, it was affirmed that agricultural scientific workers must establish a production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, overall viewpoint, high-yield viewpoint, and cooperation viewpoint, and must boost revolutionary vigor and carry forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act in order to complete the major tasks entrusted to scientific workers by the Party and the people. Many agricultural scientific workers expressed that they would step out of the laboratory, go deep into practice, and learn from the broad masses. They also closely combined with the current needs and re-determined scientific research topics for serving agricultural production.

The conference believed that in order to achieve the basic elimination of wheat diseases and pests nationwide within three years, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the general line, rely on the whole Party and the whole people to run science under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the policy of scientific research taking the mass line and serving the great leap forward in production. It also studied and proposed many revolutionary measures. Preparations were made for achieving even greater harvests of wheat next year and in the future.

The National Conference on Wheat Disease and Pest Control was a comprehensive conference on prevention and research of diseases and pests. The representatives attending this conference included: representatives of administrative units from major wheat producing provinces, representatives of high-yield model laborers, representatives from the Central Ministry of Agriculture's Plant Protection Bureau, the Central Meteorological Bureau, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, agricultural universities across the country, agricultural science research institutes in various regions, and relevant representatives from major research units in various provinces, as well as more than 200 representatives from various special districts of Anhui Province.

    三年内基本消灭小麦病虫害
    全国防治小麦病虫工作会议制定了苦战规划和革命措施
    新华社合肥2日电　7月下旬在安徽省合肥市召开的全国防治小麦病虫工作会议上，提出了全国防治和研究小麦病虫工作总规划。规划要求采取一切措施，苦战三年在全国范围内基本消灭小麦病虫害。从今年秋播小麦时，即动手彻底消灭线虫病；1960年前消灭三种黑穗病和麦秆蝇，基本消灭麦锈病、赤霉病和红病为害。到1960年消灭小麦吸浆虫和地下害虫。
    会议由中国农业科学院主持。会上，在十个典型经验报告中，总结了1958年及其以前的小麦病虫害防治和研究工作。这些典型经验报告中有：安徽省依靠广大群众的智慧，应用土药大面积防治秆锈病，赢得了大丰收；河南省建立了群众性的虫情测报站（点）大面积防治吸浆虫，获得了大丰收；在试验研究报告中还介绍了用六六六粉剂处理土壤根治小麦吸浆虫的经验等。会上，充分研究和总结了这些来自生产实践中的丰富经验，并建议在全国范围内大力推广这些经验。
    全国小麦病虫工作会议，贯彻了以虚带实的精神，批判了农业科学研究工作中，过去在研究路线和研究方法上的错误和缺点。通过摆事实，讲道理，深刻批判了先理论、后生产的脱离实际的唯心论的研究观点；批判了认为药剂防治不能解决锈病问题、只能靠抗锈品种的“唯品种”论；批判了在药剂使用上只相信“洋”药，认为“土”药不管用的洋化思想；批判了认为书本上没有的和外国没有解决的，就无法解决，而不相信群众创造等的迷信、右倾保守思想，以及同业异梦，夺名利，不从整体出发等资产阶级个人主义思想。科学工作者认识到这些思想，是造成脱离群众、脱离生产、使农业科学远远落在形势后面的重要原因，是农业科学跃进的主要障碍。会上，联系今年广大农民群众，在党的领导下在病虫害防治工作上所取得的辉煌成果，肯定了农业科学工作者，必须树立生产观点、群众观点、整体观点、丰产观点和协作观点，必须鼓足革命干劲，发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，才能完成党和人民交给科学工作者的重大任务。很多农业科学工作者表示，要走出实验室，深入实践，向广大群众学习。并紧密结合当前需要，重新确定了为农业生产服务的科学研究题目。
    会议认为，为了达到在三年内全国基本消灭小麦病虫害，必须贯彻总路线精神，在党的领导下，依靠全党全民办科学，坚决贯彻科学研究走群众路线，为生产大跃进服务的方针。并且研究和提出了许多革命性措施。对明年及今后小麦争取更大丰收作了准备工作。
    全国小麦病虫工作会议，是防治和研究病虫害的综合性会议。参加这次会议的代表有：小麦主要生产省份的行政单位代表、高额丰产劳模代表、中央农业部植物保护局、中央气象局、中国科学院、中国农业科学院、全国各农业院校、各地区农业科学研究所及各省的主要研究单位有关代表和安徽省各专区代表二百多人。
