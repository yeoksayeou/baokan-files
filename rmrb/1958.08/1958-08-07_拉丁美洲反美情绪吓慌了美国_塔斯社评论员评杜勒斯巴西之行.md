Xinhua News Agency, August 6th. TASS Moscow, August 6th dispatch: TASS commentator Orlov, in commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' trip to Rio de Janeiro, wrote that Dulles' visit to Brazil has once again drawn people's attention to the relationship between the United States and its southern neighbors. The purpose of Dulles' trip is that the U.S. government, frightened by the anti-imperialist sentiment in Latin America, is eager to pacify its southern flank.

Orlov said that Dulles learned from the words of U.S. Vice President Nixon and U.S. President Eisenhower's brother, Milton Eisenhower, who had recently visited Latin America, how great a force the angry public in Latin America is, and this force is promoting the upsurge of the national liberation movement in Latin America. In Brazil, as in other Latin American countries, there is a growing demand for liberation from the guardianship of American monopoly capital, because American monopoly capital is bankrupting the economies of these countries.

Orlov said that Dulles hurried to Rio de Janeiro to put pressure on Brazil again in accordance with the traditional policies of American imperialism. For this purpose, Dulles will probably use the old trick again - creating the so-called "communist danger" argument. Maybe he will also look for traces of so-called "indirect aggression" in Brazil. It seems that Dulles will not have any other tricks, as the saying goes, "a guilty conscience needs no accuser."

Orlov said that the famous American commentator Lippmann has already admitted in the "New York Herald Tribune" that Dulles is likely to take such a course of action. This commentator wrote that "Frankly speaking, indirect aggression is a weapon commonly used in power politics." And one of the main planners of this policy is Dulles. Lippmann warned not to be deceived by the claim of "indirect aggression." He predicted that people might not only remind Dulles of the U.S. occupation of the Panama Canal area, but also mention more recent events: the blatant interference in the internal affairs of Guatemala, Iran, and many other countries, not to mention the Lebanese incident that Lippmann avoided mentioning. Indeed, such warnings may be raised not only in the United Nations, but also in Rio de Janeiro. Lippmann believes that the U.S. President may "need a more flexible person to help Dulles."

### 拉丁美洲反美情绪吓慌了美国  塔斯社评论员评杜勒斯巴西之行

    拉丁美洲反美情绪吓慌了美国
    塔斯社评论员评杜勒斯巴西之行
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科6日讯：塔斯社评论员奥尔洛夫在评论美国国务卿杜勒斯里约热内卢之行时写道，杜勒斯这次访问巴西重新引起人们注意美国同它的南方邻国的相互关系。杜勒斯此行的目的是：美国政府被拉丁美洲的反帝情绪吓慌了，它正急于平定它的南部后方。
    奥尔洛夫说，杜勒斯从不久前访问过拉丁美洲的美国副总统尼克松和美国总统艾森豪威尔的弟弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔的话里知道，拉丁美洲愤怒的公众是一支多么大的力量，这支力量正在促进拉丁美洲民族解放运动的高涨。在巴西，正如在其他拉丁美洲国家一样，人们越来越要求从美国垄断资本的监护下解放出来，因为美国的垄断的资本在使这些国家的经济破产。
    奥尔洛夫说，杜勒斯赶忙去里约热内卢就是为了本着美国帝国主义的传统政策对巴西再次施加压力。为了这个目的，杜勒斯大概又要运用老一套的办法——制造所谓“共产主义危险”的说法了。也许他还要在巴西找寻所谓“间接侵略”的痕迹。看来杜勒斯不会有什么别的花样，正如俗话说得好，“做贼心虚”。
    奥尔洛夫说，美国著名评论员李普曼在“纽约先驱论坛报”上已经承认，杜勒斯正是可能采取这种行动方针的。这个评论员写道，“老实说，间接侵略是实力政策惯用的武器。”而这种政策的主要策划者之一就是杜勒斯。李普曼警告不要被“间接侵略”的说法所迷惑。他预料，人们不仅可能向杜勒斯提醒美国侵占巴拿马运河地区的事件，而且可能提到更近的事件：对危地马拉、伊朗和其他许多国家的内政的粗暴干涉，至于李普曼避而不谈的黎巴嫩事件那更不用说了。的确，这种警告不仅可能在联合国提出，而且也可能在里约热内卢提出。李普曼认为：美国总统可能“须要头脑更灵活的人去帮助杜勒斯”。
