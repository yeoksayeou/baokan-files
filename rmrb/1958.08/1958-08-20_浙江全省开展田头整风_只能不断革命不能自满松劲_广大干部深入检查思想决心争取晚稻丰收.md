This reporter, Yi Xintian, reports from Hangzhou on the 19th: Cadres across Zhejiang Province are comprehensively launching a field rectification movement that closely integrates rectification with production to ensure increased late rice production.

Currently, in Ningbo, Taizhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Jiande, and other regions, 400,000 cadres have gone deep into the fields to examine production, measures, drive, work style, and the responsibility system. They are fiercely burning away "tension theory," "dismounting theory," and complacent, slackening sentiments, continuing to exert great effort, fully mobilizing the masses, demanding a thorough breaking of the "three barriers" (fertilizer, pests and diseases, lodging), and launching a "four guarantees" (guarantee clumps, guarantee plants, guarantee ears, guarantee grains) movement, to ensure the realization of the increased production plan of late rice surpassing early rice and doubling the yield.

Zhejiang Province achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of early rice this year, with both total output and yield per unit area more than doubling compared to last year. Now, cadres and the masses throughout the province are making every effort to strive for an even greater bumper harvest of late autumn crops. However, some cadres are content with the achievements already made, fostering a sense of relaxation. Some are shouting "excessive tension," demanding to "dismount and rest," and some are even asking questions such as "Is there a bottom to tension? Is there an end to the Great Leap Forward?" Some cadres, seeing that the early rice yield has reached 800 jin per mu, believe that late rice is "extra income," harboring the thought of "reaping if there is, discarding if there isn't," and some cadres are therefore "full and lazy," lacking drive. Some people in Pingyang County criticized some cadres, saying, "Output doubles, but effort halves." Due to these complacent and slackening thoughts and emotions, many regions have relaxed the field management of late autumn crops, and measures have not kept up with targets. It has now been discovered that many late rice crops lack sufficient fertilizer, some rice plants have turned yellow, and pests and diseases are serious in some areas.

Based on the current ideological and production situation of the cadres, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to launch a field rectification movement throughout the province from top to bottom. In July, the Provincial Committee held meetings in Huangyan County and Zhuji County, attended by secretaries of district committees and county committees, to conduct rectification. At the beginning of August, the Provincial Committee held another telephone conference to urge various localities to carry out rectification in conjunction with production. Subsequently, the various district committees throughout the province, following the instructions of the Provincial Committee, held expanded meetings of the district committees, adopting methods of displaying output, comparing levels, finding reasons, grasping measures, and establishing opposites to seriously summarize the experiences and lessons learned from the bumper harvest of early rice and criticize complacent and slackening sentiments. Party committees at and below the county level adopted field rectification methods, organizing cadres to leave their offices, go deep into the fields, conduct inspections while rectifying, and make rectification revolve around current production.

In the process of carrying out the field rectification movement, various localities first launched mass mutual inspections between teams and teams, communes and communes, and townships and townships, promptly disseminating advanced experiences, discovering problems on one hand and immediately solving them on the other. After cadres at all levels in Taizhou Prefecture went deep into the fields, combined with inspecting current production, they are launching a major ideological debate centered on striving for high speed, thoroughly breaking down the "tension theory" and "dismounting theory." After Huangyan County in this region overcame the complacency and rest mentality existing among cadres and the masses through field inspections and major debates, 450,000 agricultural commune members formed specialized teams for accumulating and applying fertilizer, weeding fields, and controlling pests, working day and night under the slogan of "achieving no missing clumps, no dead plants, no pests and diseases, and no lodging," and rushing to complete the weeding and topdressing tasks for more than 300,000 mu of late rice. At the same time, an army of 200,000 people jointly prevented and controlled pests, and timely control was carried out on 200,000 mu of rice fields where pests had already occurred. In Ningbo Prefecture, 200,000 cadres at all levels set up thatched sheds and lived in the fields. Many counties, districts, and townships moved their offices to the fields, implementing contracted areas with responsibilities assigned to each plot, working together with the masses, and through major inspections, major evaluations, and major competitions, burned away complacent and slackening thoughts and vigorously grasped field management work. Their slogan is: to make first-class seedlings even better, upgrade second-class seedlings, and eliminate third-class seedlings within a limited time. More than 1,500 cadres in the Fengqiao District of Zhuji County converged in the fields, conducted field-by-field seedling checks, and field-side diagnoses and prescriptions, establishing a special management system of "every plant has someone to look after, every plot has someone to manage, and every field has someone to protect." Cadres at all levels in Jinhua, Jiande, Jiaxing, and other regions have also gone deep into the fields, inspecting and rectifying at the same time.

### 浙江全省开展田头整风　只能不断革命不能自满松劲　广大干部深入检查思想决心争取晚稻丰收

　　浙江全省开展田头整风
　　只能不断革命不能自满松劲
　　广大干部深入检查思想决心争取晚稻丰收
    本报杭州19日电  本报记者伊心恬报道：浙江省各地干部正全面开展整风和生产紧密结合的田头整风运动，保证实现晚稻增产。
    目前，宁波、台州、嘉兴、金华、建德等专区已有四十万干部深入田间，查生产、查措施、查干劲、查作风、查责任制，猛烧“紧张论”、“下马论”和自满松劲情绪，继续大鼓干劲，充分发动群众，要求大破“三关”（肥料、病虫害、倒伏），开展“四保”（保丛、保株、保穗、保粒）运动，保证实现晚稻超早稻、产量翻一番的增产规划。
    浙江省今年早稻获得空前大面积丰收，总产量和单位产量都比去年翻了一番以上；现在全省干部群众正千方百计地力争晚秋作物取得更大丰收。但是也有一部分干部满足于已取得的成绩。滋长了松懈情绪，有的叫喊“过分紧张”，要求“下马歇歇”，有的甚至提出“紧张有没有底？跃进有没有边？”的问题。有些干部看到早稻亩产达到八百斤了，就认为晚稻是“外快”，存在着“有就收，没就丢”的思想，有些干部因此“一饱三懒”，干劲不大。平阳县有些群众批评部分干部说：“产量翻一番，劲头减一半”。由于存在着这些自满松劲的思想情绪，不少地区放松了晚秋作物的田间管理工作，措施跟不上指标。目前已发现很多晚稻肥料不足，有的稻禾已发黄，部分地区病虫害严重。
    根据当前的干部思想和生产情况，中共浙江省委决定全省自上而下地开展一次田头整风运动。7月间，省委分别在黄岩县和诸暨县召开了有地委书记、县委书记参加的会议，进行整风。8月初省委又召开电话会议，督促各地结合生产开展整风。接着全省各地委都根据省委指示，召开了地委扩大会，采取摆产量、比高低、找原因、抓措施和树立对立面的方法，认真总结早稻丰收经验教训，批判自满松劲情绪。县以下各级党委则采用田头整风办法，组织干部走出办公室，深入田间，边检查，边整风，使整风围绕当前生产进行。
    各地在开展田头整风运动中，首先由队与队、社与社、乡与乡展开群众性的互相检查，及时传播先进经验，一面发现问题，一面立即解决。台州专区各级干部深入田间后，结合检查当前生产，正发动全体党员和群众开展一次以力争高速度为中心内容的思想大辩论，大破“紧张论”和“下马论”。这个专区的黄岩县通过田间检查和大辩论，克服了干部和群众中存在的自满休息思想后，全县有四十五万个农业社社员组成了积肥施肥、耘田、治虫等专业队，在“实现无缺丛、无死株、无病虫害、无倒伏”的口号下，日夜苦战，突击完成了三十多万亩晚稻的耘田追肥任务；同时二十万大军联防治虫，对二十万亩已经发生虫害的稻田及时进行了防治。宁波专区各级干部二十万人搭起草棚，住到田间，许多县、区、乡把办公室搬到田间去，实行分片包干，责任到丘，和群众一起劳动，通过大检查、大评比、大竞赛，火烧自满松劲思想，大抓田间管理工作。他们的口号是：要使一类苗锦上添花，二类苗升级，三类苗限期消灭。诸暨县枫桥区一千五百多名干部会师田间，进行逐丘查苗、田头诊断处方后，建立起“株株有人看、丘丘有人管、畈畈有人保”的专管制度。金华、建德、嘉兴等专区的各级干部也纷纷深入田间，边检查、边整风。
