Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian hosted a banquet this evening to welcome the entire delegation of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Vice Premier of the Cabinet Li Joo-yeon.

At the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Delegation Leader Li Joo-yeon delivered speeches one after another, warmly congratulating the unbreakable friendship between the brotherly Chinese and Korean peoples, and celebrating the great unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to the Korean government delegation. He expressed his firm belief that the visit of the distinguished Korean guests would further promote mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Korea, the common high tide of the economy, and the development of socialist construction. He said that socialist construction in China and Korea is currently flourishing at an incredible pace. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, the Korean people have not only rapidly healed the wounds of war in the short period after the war, but have also entered a new historical period of the first five-year plan, and have achieved new and great achievements in various economic sectors. Now, the Chinese people are going all out, striving for the top, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and a new situation of great leaps forward has emerged in all aspects of industry and agriculture. These achievements of the Chinese and Korean peoples not only promote the prosperity and development of the two countries' economies, but also greatly strengthen the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Delegation Leader Li Joo-yeon emphasized that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples is forged with blood, and we will strive to further consolidate this unbreakable friendship and unity. He said that under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people are implementing the first five-year plan for the development of the people's economy in Korean history for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and for the great leap forward of socialist construction in the northern half of the republic. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has already embarked on the Chollima towards socialism, will further strengthen and develop the relationship of mutual cooperation with the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the socialist camp.

Present at the banquet were Ye Jizhuang, Zeng Yongquan, Liu Mingfu, Zhang Youxuan, Lin Haiyun, Qiao Xiaoguang, and Vice Mayor of Beijing Cheng Hongyi, among others.

All diplomatic officials of the Korean Embassy in China were also invited to the banquet. (Attached picture)
