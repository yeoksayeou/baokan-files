Xinhua News Agency, London, August 11th. British political commentator and former "Punch" editor Malcolm Muggeridge, who recently visited China, pointed out in an article published in the "Sunday Pictorial" that the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is nothing more than a "dead soul" in the pocket of the U.S. State Department.

Muggeridge published a series of articles in newspapers after returning to Britain from his visit to China, talking about his impressions of China. In his most recent article, he condemned the practice of forcibly treating the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, which is "living from hand to mouth," as China, believing that this "will arouse the ridicule of future generations and the disappointment of current people." He said:

"This reminds me of Gogol's great humorous classic 'Dead Souls,' which describes how Russians bought the deeds of dead serfs to impersonate wealthy landlords."

Muggeridge mocked the Chiang Kai-shek clique as "dead souls," "[U.S. Secretary of State John Foster] Dulles has already bought its deeds—because the United States must pay to maintain it, its armed forces, and its diplomatic representatives. In fact, it died several years ago. It now only exists in the (U.S.) State Department and, due to American pressure, also in the United Nations."

Muggeridge pointed out that the United States insists on saying that Chiang Kai-shek and his gang are the government of China and wants "other governments, including the British government," to agree with this statement, recognizing Chiang Kai-shek's representatives as China's spokesmen in the United Nations. "This fact illustrates how foolishly and dangerously this absurd statement can be applied."

Muggeridge said that recognizing or not recognizing the "Beijing government" is a matter for the United States. However, "insisting on having a small group of wastrel Chinese exiles led by the completely discredited Chiang Kai-shek act as counterfeit representatives to occupy China's position in the United Nations is not just a matter for the United States, but a matter of deep concern to other countries in the world."

Muggeridge said: "The British government's constant submission to this American attitude is cowardly and stupid."

In an earlier article published in the "Sunday Pictorial," Muggeridge said that he saw "amazing progress" in industry and other areas in China. He concluded that in the next "ten years or so," China will become one of the world's major industrial powers.

He said that the Chinese government has won the respect of the people of the whole country. China's currency is stable. Speculation and corruption have disappeared. Living standards are constantly improving. Significant progress has been made in education, and illiteracy will be completely eliminated. There is a genuine relationship of equality and self-respect between people.

The social atmosphere is warm, intense, and busy. The Chinese revolution is a "happy revolution." The Chinese people have a "happy, busy, and carefree air."

When he exemplified China's large-scale mass movements, he said that there are no flies in China. "Since I crossed the Chinese border, I have only seen two lonely flies, one of which may be symbolic, crawling on the movie screen of the British representative office."

He said that he saw an "energetic and hopeful atmosphere" in China, something he did not see during his visits to other parts of Asia.

He concluded that the Chinese regime is definitely going to exist and prosper even more.

He believes that if China's current Great Leap Forward is successful, the results will be very beneficial not only to China but also to the rest of Asia and indeed to the whole world. He said: "I don't see why anyone would think this development is threatening."

### 英国政论家马格里兹发表文章说　美国想把台湾的“死魂灵”冒充中国　这种荒谬愚蠢作法将受到后世嘲笑

　　英国政论家马格里兹发表文章说
　　美国想把台湾的“死魂灵”冒充中国
　　这种荒谬愚蠢作法将受到后世嘲笑
    新华社伦敦11日电　最近刚刚访问过中国的英国政论家、前“笨拙周刊”编辑马尔科姆·马格里兹在“星期日画报”上发表的一篇文章中指出，台湾蒋介石集团不过是美国国务院囊中的“死魂灵”。
    马格里兹在访问中国返回英国后在报刊上发表了一系列文章，谈他访问中国的印象。他在最近发表的一篇文章中指责了那种硬把在台湾的“朝不保夕的”蒋介石集团当作中国的作法，认为这“将要引起后世的嘲笑和目前人们的失望”。他说：
  “这使我想起了果戈里的伟大的幽默古典名著‘死魂灵’，它描写俄国人如何收买死农奴的身契来冒充有钱的地主。”
    马格里兹讥笑蒋介石集团就是“死魂灵”，“杜勒斯先生已经收买了它的身契——因为美国必须出钱支付维持它、维持它的武装部队和外交代表的费用。实际上它在几年前就死去了。它现在只存在于（美国）国务院中，并且由于美国的压力，也存在于联合国中。”
    马格里兹指出，美国坚持要把蒋介石及其一伙说成是中国政府并且要“包括英国政府在内的其他政府”同意这种说法，承认蒋介石的代表是中国在联合国的发言人，“这个事实说明了这种荒谬说法是能够如何愚蠢和危险地被加以应用”。
    马格里兹说：承认或不承认“北京政府”是美国的事情。但是，“坚持由信誉完全扫地的蒋介石所领导的一小撮废物般的中国流亡分子充任冒牌的代表来占据中国在联合国的地位，这却不只是美国自己的事情了，而是世界其它各国所深切关心的事情。”
    马格里兹说：“英国政府不断地屈从于美国的这种态度是懦弱而愚蠢的。”
    马格里兹在这以前在“星期日画报”上发表的文章中说，他在中国看到了工业及其他方面的“惊人进步”。他的结论是，在今后“十年左右”的时间里，中国将成为世界主要工业国之一。
    他说，中国政府取得了全国人民的尊敬。中国的货币是稳定的。投机倒把和贪污腐化都已经绝迹。生活水平在不断提高。教育方面已经取得显著进步，文盲也将全部扫除。人与人之间存在着真正平等与自尊的关系。
    社会空气是热情、紧张和忙碌的。中国革命是一个“愉快的革命”。中国人民有一种“愉快的、忙碌的、无忧无虑的神气”。
    他在举例说明中国的大规模的群众运动时说，中国没有苍蝇。“自从我越过中国边境以来，我只看到过两只孤独的苍蝇，其中一只苍蝇也许是有象征意义的，它在英国代办处电影银幕上爬。”
    他说，他在中国看见“精力充沛，满怀希望的气氛”，这一点是他在他访问亚洲其他地方时看不到的东西。
    他由此得出结论说，中国政权肯定地是要存在下去并且要更加兴旺的。
    他认为，如果目前中国的大跃进成功的话，其结果将不仅对中国，而且对亚洲其余国家以及确实对全世界都非常有利。他说：“我看不出为什么有人会认为这种发展是带有威胁性的。”
