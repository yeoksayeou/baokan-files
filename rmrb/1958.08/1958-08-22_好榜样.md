　　Good Example
　　In the column "Always Be a Revolutionary," the life of demobilized soldiers is vividly depicted. These facts tell people that the demobilization of revolutionary soldiers does not mean the end of their fighting life, but rather the beginning of a new battle. It's just that the battlefield has shifted—from the military battlefield to the production battlefield. It is precisely because of understanding this point that our demobilized soldiers have adopted the same fighting posture as they did on the front lines, and are carrying out tenacious labor on the production front.
　　Demobilized soldiers, in the past, fought heroically on the battlefield, defeated the fierce enemy, and laid the foundation for our peaceful construction; now, they are directly participating in labor and have made significant achievements in production. When the motherland needs them to fight, they fight; when the motherland needs them to work, they work. This is the glorious example set by demobilized soldiers for us.

　　好榜样
    “永远做革命派”的专栏里，生动地描绘了复员军人的生活。这些事实告诉人们：革命战士复员了，不是意味着战斗生活的结束，而是意味着新的战斗的开始。只不过战场转移了位置——由军事战场转移到生产战场。正是由于理解到这一点，我们的复员军人同志们，才拿出了在前线一样的战斗姿态，在生产战线上进行着顽强的劳动。
    复员军人同志们，过去在战场上英勇战斗，打败了凶恶的敌人，为我们的和平建设奠定了基础；现在，他们又直接的参加劳动，在生产上取得了重大成就。祖国需要战斗时就战斗，祖国需要劳动时就劳动，这就是复员军人为我们树立的光辉榜样。
