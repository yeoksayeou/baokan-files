Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 27th: Zhongning County in the Ningxia region, famous for its special product, the goji berry, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The county's 7,833 mu of goji berries yielded a total of more than 1,045,000 jin, with an average yield per mu increasing by 30% compared to last year.

Zhongning goji berries are a valuable medicinal material, sold both domestically and internationally for a long time. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, production was greatly damaged. By 1949, the county had only 2,800 mu of goji berries left. After liberation, the Party and the government gave great assistance to farmers planting goji berries and raised the purchase price. As a result, the planting area and yield of goji berries have increased year by year. This year, thanks to the farmers' multiple applications of fertilizer, plowing, weeding, and pruning, the goji berries grew particularly well. Starting in June, the picking period lasted for two months, with some plants being picked more than ten times before they finished flowering, making the picking period twice as long as in previous years.

　　中宁枸杞丰收
    新华社银川27日电宁夏地区中宁县著名的特产枸杞，今年又获得空前大丰收。全县七千八百三十三亩枸杞，共产一百零四万五千多斤，平均亩产量比去年增加30％。
    中宁枸杞是名贵药材，长期销售于国内外。但是在国民党反动统治时期，生产受到很大破坏，到1949年全县只剩下二千八百余亩枸杞。解放以后，党和政府给种植枸杞的农民以很大帮助，并且提高了收购价格。因此枸杞种植面积和产量年年增加。今年由于农民多次追肥，翻地和除杂草、修枝等，枸杞生长得特别好。从6月开始，采摘期达两个月之久，有的连续采摘十多次才谢，采摘期比往年长一倍。
