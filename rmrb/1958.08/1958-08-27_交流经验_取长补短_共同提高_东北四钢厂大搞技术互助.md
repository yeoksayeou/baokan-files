Exchange Experiences, Learn from Each Other's Strengths, and Improve Together
Northeast China's Four Steel Plants Vigorously Promote Technical Mutual Assistance
    (Our Report) The fifth inter-factory technical assistance conference of the four steel plants in Northeast China, including Dalian Steel Plant and Benxi Steel Plant, was recently held at Dalian Steel Plant. During the meeting, representatives from the four plants exchanged 56 items of advanced experience and decided to launch a socialist labor competition among workshops of the same type in the four plants.
    The inter-factory technical assistance competition among the four steel plants in Northeast China was initially launched by Benxi and other two steel plants in September 1956. After the official commencement of the inter-factory technical assistance competition among these four steel plants, each plant conscientiously implemented the socialist competition principle of "learning from each other, helping each other, drawing on strengths, and compensating for weaknesses, and improving together." This ensured the victorious fulfillment of the technical assistance contracts and promoted the great leap forward in production and technology in the four plants. For example, in order to improve the ingot yield rate, Benxi Steel Plant promoted the advanced experience of heating the ingot head, which resulted in shortening the ingot head. However, the shortening of the ingot head brought danger to steel rolling, resulting in multiple injuries. Later, they came to Dalian Steel Plant and saw that the up-and-down table for turning steel plates used by the blooming mill was very good. After returning to their plant, they immediately promoted this experience and eliminated injuries. Dalian Steel Plant took a long time to change rolling mills, affecting the increase in output. However, Benxi Steel Plant took a very short time to change rolling mills. Therefore, the four plants convened a professional meeting at Benxi Steel Plant to introduce experience and conduct on-site visits and learning. After returning to their plant, Dalian Steel Plant promoted this experience, shortening the rolling time for medium-sized steel by 50% and for small-sized steel by 30% to 40%. The four steel plants also jointly found solutions and mutually assisted each other in resolving difficulties in raw materials and other aspects.
    During the meeting, they officially decided to develop the original inter-factory equipment competition into a competition among workshops of the same type between factories, and decided to delegate contract management authority from the factory to the workshops, establishing a technical innovation express report and technical assistance card system between the four factories. This allows the four factories to promptly exchange technical innovation experiences that arise at any time but were not signed in the contract projects, and better leverage the enthusiasm of the workshops for mutual assistance and competition.

　　交流经验　取长补短　共同提高
    东北四钢厂大搞技术互助
    本报讯　大连钢厂、本溪钢厂等东北四个钢厂的厂际技术互助第五次会议，最近在大连钢厂举行。会议期间，四个厂的代表交流了五十六项先进经验，决定开展四个厂同工种车间的社会主义劳动竞赛。
    东北四个钢厂的厂际技术互助竞赛，是在1956年9月由本溪等两个钢厂首先发起的。这四个钢厂厂际技术互助竞赛正式展开以后，各厂都认真贯彻了“互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高”的社会主义竞赛原则，因而保证了技术互助合同的胜利实现，促进了四个厂的生产和技术的跃进。如本溪钢厂为了提高钢锭收合率，推行了钢锭帽口加热的先进经验，结果使钢锭帽头缩短了。但是，钢锭帽头的缩小，却给轧钢带来了危险，多次发生伤人事故。后来他们来到大连钢厂，看到该厂开坯机使用的升降台翻钢板很好，回厂后他们马上推广了这个经验，杜绝了伤人事故。大连钢厂换轧辊时间长，影响产量的提高，而本溪钢厂的换轧辊时间很短，于是四个厂在本溪钢厂召开了专业会议介绍经验，进行现场参观学习。大连钢厂回厂后推广了这个经验，使中型轧钢的换辊时间缩短了50％，小型轧钢缩短了30％到40％。在原材料和其他方面的一些困难，这四个钢厂也共同想法，互助解决。
    会议期间，他们正式确定将原有厂际间设备竞赛发展为厂际同工种车间的竞赛，并且决定将合同管理权由厂部下放到车间，建立四个厂之间的技术革新快报和技术互助卡片制。这样就能使四个厂之间及时交流在合同项目中没有签订的随时出现的技术革新经验，更好地发挥车间的互助竞赛的积极性。
