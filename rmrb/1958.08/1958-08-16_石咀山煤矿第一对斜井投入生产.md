The first pair of inclined shafts at the Shizuishan Coal Mine in Ningxia were completed six months ahead of schedule on August 1st and officially put into production. The designed annual output of these inclined shafts is 450,000 tons, and the entire production process is mechanized.

The employees of the First Shaft Construction Team of the Shizuishan Coal Mine, who were responsible for constructing these inclined shafts, actively worked with the spirit of leaping forward again and again to ensure the early handover of the mine for production. They completed the shaft construction task ahead of schedule in just two hundred and eighty days.

    石咀山煤矿第一对斜井投入生产
    宁夏石咀山煤矿第一对斜井，已在8月1日提前半年建成并正式投入生产。这对斜井的设计年产量为四十五万吨，全部生产过程都是机械化的。
    建设这对斜井的石咀山煤矿第一建井队职工，为了保证矿井提前移交生产，个个都以跃进再跃进的精神积极施工。他们只用了二百八十天时间，就提前完成了建井任务。
