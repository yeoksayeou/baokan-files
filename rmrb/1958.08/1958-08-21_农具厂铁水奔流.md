　　Iron Water Flows at the Farm Tool Factory

　　Late at night on July 21st, people were already asleep. The local blast furnace in the casting workshop of our county's farm tool repair factory was still blazing. The workers, stripped to the waist, were smelting iron. This was their third iron smelting experiment.

　　Around the iron smelting furnace, the comrades operating the bellows were constantly sending air into the furnace with a "whoosh, whoosh" sound, and the comrades loading the materials were putting large amounts of coke and ore into the furnace... Everyone was sweating profusely from the intense heat of the furnace, but they still persisted in their work. They had only one thought in their minds: to get iron water to flow from the local blast furnace!

　　In a burst of tense bellows blowing and the roar of the furnace fire, fiery red iron water flowed out of the furnace opening. Sparks flew in all directions, illuminating half the sky. The workers could not contain their inner joy, and thunderous applause and laughter broke through the silent night.

　　After the iron water cooled, it was tested and proved that this furnace of bright white pig iron was completely up to standard. The workers discussed happily: "As long as we have determination, we can smelt iron!"

　　农具厂铁水奔流
    7月21日深夜，人们早已入睡了。我们县农具修配厂铸工车间的土高炉还在冒着熊熊的火焰。工人们一个个光着臂膀在炼铁。这已是他们炼铁的第三次试验了。
    在炼铁炉的周围，操使风箱的同志呼达呼达地不断往炉里送风，装料的同志把大量焦炭和矿石投入炉中……。每个人都被强烈的炉火烤得汗流浃背，但是他们还是坚持工作。他们脑海里只有一个念头，就是叫土高炉流出铁水来！
    在一阵紧张的风箱吹火声和炉火的吼叫声中，火红色的铁水从炉口里流出来了。火花四溅，照红了半个天空。工人们都抑制不住内心的喜悦，雷鸣般的掌声和欢笑声，冲破了寂静的黑夜。
    铁水冷却后经过化验，证明这一炉光亮的白口生铁完全合乎标准。工人们高兴地议论着：“只要有决心，就能炼出铁来！”
