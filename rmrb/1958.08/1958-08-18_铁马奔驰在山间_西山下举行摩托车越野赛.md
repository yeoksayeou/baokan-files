　　Motorcycle Cross-Country Race Held at the Foot of the Western Hills

　　(Our report) The first National Motorcycle Cross-Country Race was held yesterday at the Western Hills in Beijing. The men's competition was held first in the morning, and the Liaoning contestant He Yongyou arrived first with a time of one hour, fifty-two minutes, thirty-one and nine-tenths seconds, winning the championship. The second place went to Heilongjiang contestant Zhao Huaxin, with a time of one hour, fifty-four minutes, sixteen and two-tenths seconds.

　　The competition started at 10:30 am. At the foot of the Western Hills, thirty-one male athletes gathered, fully prepared, to "start" the first lap, with starts every ten minutes thereafter. The athletes rode ten laps around the mountain according to the prescribed route, each lap being 4.4 kilometers.

　　As the starting gun fired for the first lap, the athletes started their motorcycles on a flat area at the foot of the Western Hills, and after about twenty meters of flat ground, they drove their vehicles up a mountain slope about forty meters long and about thirty-two degrees steep, then down a slope of about thirty degrees, and also crossed a muddy area about thirty meters long. Throughout the 44-kilometer course, the competition among the contestants was extremely fierce.

　　The women's competition was held in the afternoon, with a total of thirty athletes participating. The route was the same as for the men's team, with each person running five laps, each lap also being 4.4 kilometers. As a result of the competition, Wang Baolan from the Beijing Electron Tube Factory won first place with a time of one hour and thirty-six and six-tenths seconds, and Shang Jiuying from the Tianjin team took second place with a time of one hour, five minutes, and ten and five-tenths seconds. Wang Baolan is a worker at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, with a good physique, good technique, and only a year of motorcycle training. This time, the result she achieved was better than that of many of the male athletes participating in the competition. (Attached photo)

　　铁马奔驰在山间
　　西山下举行摩托车越野赛
    本报讯　全国首届摩托车越野赛昨日在北京西山举行。上午先举行男子比赛，结果辽宁选手赫永友以一小时五十二分三十一秒九首先到达，获冠军。第二名是黑龙江选手赵华鑫，成绩是一小时五十四分十六秒二。
    比赛在十时半开始，在西山脚下，三十一名男子运动员整装集合，作第一圈“发车”，以后每间隔十分钟发车一次。运动员按规定路线绕山十圈，每圈四点四公里。
    第一圈发令枪响，运动员们就在西山脚下的一块平地上蹬车发火，通过约二十公尺平地，即驱车冲上长约四十公尺、坡高约三十二度的山坡，接着又冲下约有三十度的山坡，还穿过一条约长三十公尺的泥浆地带。在四十四公里的全程中，选手们的竞争异常剧烈。
    下午举行了女子比赛，共有三十名运动员参加。比赛的路线和男子队相同，每个人共跑五圈，每圈也是四点四公里。比赛结果北京队王保兰以一小时零三十六秒六获得第一名，天津队尚久莹得第二名，成绩是一小时五分十秒五。王保兰是北京电子管厂的工人，身体好、技术好、练摩托车只有一年，这次她创造的成绩比参加比赛的很多男运动员的成绩都好。（附图片）
