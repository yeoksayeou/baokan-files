　　Role Models for Urban Residents
　　Li Yan
    In our country, life is changing with each passing day, brilliant and colorful. The universal organization of Tianjin's neighborhood residents, working and living together, transforming from individual to collective, from consumer to producer, is another brilliant spectacle emanating from the boiling life of the Great Leap Forward for all the people.
    Collectivization is the direction of development for all our undertakings. Not to mention our country's workers, farmers have long been organized, handicraftsmen have long been organized, and even small merchants and peddlers have long been organized. But what about urban residents? What about the family members of workers and staff? They have always been in a scattered state, they have always been "individual households." Can they also be organized and collectivized? Tianjin's experience has provided a convincing affirmative answer: collectivization is also the fundamental direction for urban residents, including the family members of workers and staff.
    Mobilizing all positive factors is an important condition for building socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Now we feel labor shortages everywhere. But what about the millions of urban residents? Even if they have the great ambition of the Great Leap Forward, they lack effective methods for the Great Leap Forward. They are either burdened by household chores, unable to free themselves; or because they are not organized, they have strength but nowhere to use it. This is a contradiction. After Tianjin's urban residents were organized, this contradiction was thoroughly resolved, fully tapping the potential of all kinds of people, enabling them all to generate heat and light for socialist construction. According to the Tianjin Daily, after all of Tianjin's residents were organized, the labor capacity unearthed was equivalent to the entire labor capacity of Tianjin's existing industrial workers. If cities across the country did this, what a tremendous labor force would be generated! Moreover, since the main target of organization is housewives, this resolves the contradiction between the burden of household labor and participation in social production and social service, creating the most sufficient conditions for the complete liberation of women and the true equality of men and women.
    Existence determines consciousness, and people's mode of production and way of life determine people's state of mind. This is the most fundamental definition of historical materialism. It is a fact that the urban residents of our country, due to the Party's long-term education, the influence of the entire social atmosphere, and especially after the rectification campaign in the neighborhoods, have greatly increased their collectivist and communist ideology. However, it is also a fact that the individual labor and living conditions of urban residents are not conducive to the growth of collectivist and communist ideology. This is another contradiction. The organization of urban residents in Tianjin has also created conditions for resolving this contradiction. Collectivist and communist ideology motivates people to organize, and after organizing, it will greatly promote and consolidate collectivist and communist ideology. Common labor and common life will gradually make people feel that collectivism and communism are so closely integrated with their own vital interests, and labor and life itself will conduct the most profound and practical collectivist and communist education for people. It is certain that after urban residents are organized, there will be a Great Leap Forward in production and a Great Leap Forward in ideology.
    The organization of urban residents is another aspect of the Great Leap Forward for all the people. Its emergence not only fundamentally solves the problem of how urban residents can make a Great Leap Forward, but also has a huge impact on many aspects of the Great Leap Forward. We must warmly praise this new initiative and actively support this new thing! We must learn from the new style shown by Tianjin residents in the Great Leap Forward.

　　城市居民的榜样
　　黎言
    在我们国家里，生活是如此日新月异，绚烂多彩。天津街道居民普遍组织起来，一起生产，一起生活，变个体为集体，变消费者为生产者，就是全民大跃进的沸腾生活放出的又一异彩。
    集体化是我们一切事业发展的方向，我国的工人不要说，农民早已组织起来了，手工业者早已组织起来了，小商小贩也早已组织起来了，可是城市居民呢？职工家属呢？他们一直处在分散状态，他们一直还是“单干户”，能不能也组织起来，也集体化呢？天津的经验作了令人信服的肯定的回答：集体化也是包括职工家属在内的城市居民的根本方向。
    调动一切积极因素，是多快好省地建设社会主义的一个重要条件。现在是到处感到劳动紧张，到处感到劳力不足。而千百万的城市居民呢？纵然有大跃进的一片雄心，却没有大跃进的有效办法。他们或者被家务劳动拖累着，无法解脱出来；或者是因为没有组织起来，有武而无用武之地。这是一个矛盾。天津城市居民组织起来以后，彻底地解决了这个矛盾，充分发掘了各种人的潜力，使他们都能够为社会主义建设发热放光。据天津日报报道：天津居民全部组织起来以后，挖掘出来的劳动能力，相当于天津现有产业职工的全部劳动能力。如果全国城市都这样作，该会产生多么巨大的劳动威力！而且，由于组织起来的主要对象是家庭妇女，这就解决了家务劳动的拖累和参加社会生产、社会服务事业的矛盾，为妇女的彻底的解放，为男女的真正平等创造了最充分的条件。
    存在决定意识，人们的生产方式和生活方式决定人们的思想状况，这是历史唯物主义最根本的定义。我国的城市居民，由于党的长期教育，由于整个社会风气的影响，特别是经过街道整风以后，集体主义和共产主义思想有了很大增长，这是事实。可是，城市居民个体的劳动和生活状态，却不利于集体主义和共产主义思想的生长，也是事实。这又是一个矛盾。天津的城市居民组织起来，也为解决这个矛盾创造了条件。集体主义和共产主义思想推动人们组织起来，组织起来以后，又会大大发扬和巩固集体主义和共产主义思想。共同劳动和共同生活，会使人们逐渐感到集体主义、共产主义同自己的切身利益是这样水乳交融、血肉相连，劳动和生活本身，就会对人们进行最深刻最切实的集体主义和共产主义教育。可以肯定，城市居民组织起来以后，生产上会大跃进，思想上也会大跃进。
    城市居民组织起来，这是全民大跃进的又一个方面，它的出现，不仅从根本上解决了城市居民如何大跃进的问题，而且还给大跃进的很多方面以巨大影响。我们要热烈歌颂这种新创举，要积极支持这种新事物！要学习天津市居民在大跃进中间表现的新风格。
