　　Beat Drums and Gongs to Eliminate the Four Pests
　　Rats are treacherous, sparrows are bad, flies and mosquitoes are like rightists!
　　They suck human blood, spread disease, steal people's happiness and engage in sabotage!
　　If you don't eliminate them, they will run rampant and harm you.
　　Every household act quickly, beat drums and gongs to eliminate the four pests.
　　　　——Fujian
