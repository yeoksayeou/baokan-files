Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower stated at a press conference on the 20th that the U.S. government still insists on refusing to withdraw troops from Lebanon. To defend this position of continued aggression, he reiterated the two U.S. withdrawal “conditions,” namely, the United States does not intend to withdraw its troops from Lebanon unless the United Nations takes measures to guarantee the so-called "stable situation" in Lebanon, or the "legitimate" government of Lebanon makes a request.

Eisenhower reaffirmed this aggressive policy of the United States while talking about the progress of the United Nations General Assembly's emergency special session. In view of the strong pressure from world public opinion demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon, and the opposition encountered by the "seven-nation proposal" instigated by the U.S. and Britain at the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. President, in order to cope with public opinion, hypocritically said, "In any case, the United States hopes to withdraw (troops) from (Lebanon) as soon as possible." However, he then contradicted himself, refusing to answer whether the United States would accept a proposal requiring the United States troops to "withdraw from Lebanon as soon as possible," and said that whether the U.S. invading troops withdraw from Lebanon "must depend on the evolution of the situation." Eisenhower's remarks exposed the ambition of U.S. imperialism to invade the countries of the Middle East in the long term.

Eisenhower insisted on the idea of establishing a so-called "United Nations Peace Force," saying it was a "good idea." Although he admitted that there was "little hope" of passing this measure at the United Nations General Assembly emergency session, he still said that if the United Nations is to be "truly effective," "it should have such a force." He said that he had studied "the issue of organizing an American detachment to participate in the United Nations Peace Force" as early as 1947. Eisenhower's words show that what the United States is concerned about is still trying its best to put a United Nations cloak on the American invading troops.

Eisenhower denied that there was an agreement between the United States and Britain on the issue of troop withdrawal. According to U.S. newspapers, under this agreement, the United States would not withdraw troops from Lebanon as long as British troops "could" not withdraw from Jordan.

Eisenhower also reiterated the hackneyed tune of so-called "indirect aggression" to justify the U.S. armed aggression against Middle Eastern countries.

The U.S. President tried his best to conceal the conspiracy of the U.S. Marines landing in Singapore to create tension in the Far East. He lied that the U.S. Marines landed in Singapore "purely for rest." However, he could not answer the questions raised by reporters about the "confusion in reporting" on this matter, nor did he dare to deny the statements made by U.S. Navy officials after the U.S. Marines landed.

Xinhua News Agency, London, August 20th: According to diplomatic sources here, the United States is negotiating an agreement with Lebanon to allow the United States to establish military bases in Lebanon.

According to these sources, U.S. President Eisenhower's "special envoy" Murphy, during his activities in Beirut not long ago, discussed the issue of reaching such an agreement with the new Lebanese President Shehab, who was "elected" with U.S. support, and other Lebanese political leaders. According to this agreement, the new Lebanese government will designate certain areas as permanent U.S. military bases after taking office in September and will invite a U.S. military delegation to reside in Lebanon. At present, while the United States is struggling frantically in the United Nations General Assembly, trying to obstruct the adoption of resolutions requiring U.S. and British troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, it is stepping up negotiations with the Lebanese government to reach the above-mentioned agreement so that U.S. troops can be stationed in Lebanon for a long time.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 21st: More and more facts show that the U.S. invading troops want to occupy Lebanon for a long time.

Construction is in full swing in the areas where the U.S. invading troops are stationed. According to newspapers here, a large company in Beirut, "Contracting and Trading Company," has signed a contract with the U.S. military to sell them timber worth a total of 1.5 million Lebanese pounds. The news said that the total value of the contracts signed by the company's director, parliamentarian Emile Bustani, with the U.S. military has so far reached 15 million Lebanese pounds. Everyone knows that Bustani is a confidant of Chamoun.

In the past few days, the U.S. invading troops have begun to build a dedicated radio station in the Beirut Cape area in western Beirut. It can be seen that some U.S. military trucks drove to the hills near the American Girls' School and unloaded large boxes containing broadcasting equipment. This radio station will be completed soon.

### 艾森豪威尔何以自圆其说  空讲愿意撤军  又在建立基地  侵略美军大兴土木准备长期盘踞

　　艾森豪威尔何以自圆其说
    空讲愿意撤军  又在建立基地
    侵略美军大兴土木准备长期盘踞
    新华社21日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔20日在记者招待会上表示，美国政府仍然坚持拒绝从黎巴嫩撤军。为了替这种继续侵略的立场辩护，他重弹了美国的两项撤军“条件”，即除非是联合国采取措施来保障黎巴嫩的所谓“稳定局面”，或者是黎巴嫩“合法的”政府提出要求，美国不打算从黎巴嫩撤退它的军队。
    艾森豪威尔是在谈到联合国大会紧急特别会议的进程时，重申美国这一侵略政策的。鉴于世界舆论要求美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩的强大压力，和美英唆使的“七国提案”在联合国大会上遭到的反对，美国总统为了应付舆论，一方面假惺惺地说，“无论如何，美国希望早日（从黎巴嫩）撤出（军队）”。但是，他接着又自打嘴巴，拒绝答复美国是否接受一项要求美国军队从黎巴嫩“早日撤退”的提案，并且说，美国侵略军队是否从黎巴嫩撤退“必须要看局势的演变而定”。艾森豪威尔这番话暴露了美帝国主义阴谋长期侵略中近东国家的野心。
    艾森豪威尔坚持建立所谓“联合国和平部队”的主张，他说这是一个“好主意”。他虽然承认要在联合国大会紧急会议上通过这项措施的“希望很少”，但是，他仍然说，如果要使联合国“真正有效”，“它就应该有这样一种部队”。他说，他在1947年即曾研究过“组织一支美国分遣队参加联合国和平部队的问题”。艾森豪威尔的话说明，美国所关心的仍然是尽力设法为美国侵略军队披上一件联合国的外衣。
    艾森豪威尔否认美、英两国间签订了一项关于撤军问题的协定，据美国报纸报道，根据这项协定，只要英国军队“能够”不撤离约旦，美国就不从黎巴嫩撤退军队。
    艾森豪威尔还重弹所谓“间接侵略”的滥调来为美国对中近东国家的武装侵略进行狡辩。
    美国总统竭力掩饰美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆以在远东制造紧张局势的阴谋，他撒谎说，美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆“纯粹是为了休息而去的”。但是，他无法解答记者提出的关于美国在这件事情上“报道上的混乱情况”，也不敢否认美国海军部官员在美国海军陆战队登陆后发表的声明。
    新华社伦敦20日电  据这里的外交界人士说，美国正在同黎巴嫩谈判一项关于允许美国在黎巴嫩建立军事基地的协定。
    据这些人士透露，美国总统艾森豪威尔的“特使”墨菲在不久以前到贝鲁特活动的时候，曾经同在美国支持下“选”出的黎巴嫩新总统谢哈布以及黎巴嫩其他政治领袖们讨论过达成这样一项协议的问题，根据这项协议，黎巴嫩新政府在9月份就职以后将指定某些地区作为美国永久的军事基地，并将邀请美国军事代表团驻在黎巴嫩。目前，美国一方面正在联合国大会中进行疯狂的挣扎，力图阻挠大会通过要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议，另一方面正在加紧同黎巴嫩政府进行谈判以达成上述协定，以便美国军队可以长久地在黎巴嫩驻扎下去。
    新华社贝鲁特21日电  越来越多的事实表明，美国侵略军要在黎巴嫩长期盘踞。
    在美国侵略军队驻扎的地方正在大兴土木。据此间的报纸说，贝鲁特的一家大公司“承包和贸易公司”已经与美军签订了合同，要卖给他们总值一百五十万黎镑的木材。消息说，这家公司的董事、议员埃米尔·布斯塔尼同美国军队签订的合同到现在为止总值已经达到一千五百万黎镑。大家知道，布斯塔尼是夏蒙的亲信。
    几天来，美国侵略军开始在贝鲁特西部的贝鲁特角地区兴建一座专门的广播电台。可以看到有些美国军用卡车向美国女子学校附近的小山开去，卸下装有广播器材的大箱子。这座广播电台将很快就建成。
