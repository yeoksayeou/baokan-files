　　Special Agent Sweep
　　U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is scheduled to visit Brazil on August 5th. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has dispatched a group of special agents to Brazil, attempting to collude with local police agencies to prevent anti-American demonstrations during Dulles' visit, clearing the way for Dulles's aggressive activities.
　　The American ruling group obviously understands that the people of Latin America do not welcome the "friendly visits" of American ruling figures. A few months ago, the people of Latin America welcomed U.S. Vice President Nixon with rotten tomatoes and rotten eggs; Milton Eisenhower, the U.S. President's brother, who is currently on a "visit" to various Caribbean countries, also failed to complete his "mission" and is about to return home in disgrace. The American ruling group understands what kind of result Dulles will get by visiting Brazil one after another. Therefore, they take preventive measures in advance and send a large number of special agents to clear the way for him.
　　On weekdays, the American ruling group boasts that it is "friendly" with other countries and pretends to be the "benefactor" of the people of other countries; however, when its Secretary of State goes on a "friendly visit", it has to use special agents as bodyguards, which is really a spoilsport!

### 特务清道

    特务清道
    美国国务卿杜勒斯预定在8月5日访问巴西。美国的联邦调查局已派遣了一批特务去巴西，企图串通当地警察机构，以防止在杜勒斯访问的时候发生反美示威，为杜勒斯的侵略活动廓清道路。
    美国统治集团显然懂得，拉丁美洲人民并不欢迎美国统治人物的“友好访问”。几个月前，拉丁美洲人民欢迎美国副总统尼克松的是烂西红柿和臭鸡蛋；目前正在加勒比海各国“访问”的美国总统的弟弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔，也没有完成“使命”，弄得灰溜溜的，就要提前回国了。杜勒斯接踵而到巴西去，将会得到什么样的结果，美国统治集团心里是明白的。因此，事先采取预防措施，派出大批特务人员替他清道。
    平日，美国统治集团吹嘘自己同别的国家“友好”，并且装做是别国人民的“恩人”；可是，当它的国务卿去作“友好访问”时，却不得不用特务来保镖，真是大煞风景！
