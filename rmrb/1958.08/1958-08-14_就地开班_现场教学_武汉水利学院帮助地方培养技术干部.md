　　Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy Helps Local Areas Train Technical Cadres

　　(Our report) The Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy recently dispatched teachers to local areas to support the training of water conservancy cadres. In two weeks, they trained a group of technical cadres for hydropower station construction in the Xiaogan Special District.

　　According to the urban-rural mutual assistance contract signed between Wuhan City and the Xiaogan Special District, the institute undertook the task of designing dozens of small hydropower stations for the Xiaogan Special District. The entire Xiaogan Special District plans to build more than six hundred hydropower stations. If the local technical force is not cultivated, it will be difficult to complete the task. Thus, the decision was made to run a "ultra-short-term" training course.

　　After receiving the new task, the teachers formulated a teaching plan, compiled seventy thousand words of accessible teaching materials, and dispatched teachers to conduct field surveys in various counties to collect teaching materials. They worked day and night for seven days and successfully completed the task. At the beginning, there were many difficulties in teaching. The students came from various counties, with varying levels of education, from primary school to high school. Most of them lacked practical experience in water conservancy construction. In addition, the time limit was short, and there was no ready-made experience for this new training method, so both teachers and students were not very confident. Under these circumstances, the teachers selected the teaching materials according to the principle of learning for practical use, focusing on the basic theory of water energy utilization calculation, the selection of water turbine and electrical equipment types, the layout design of small factory buildings, and the design and production knowledge of wooden water turbines and wooden water pipes as the basic content of teaching. At the same time, in the teaching method, they adopted a combination of learning and practice, individual tutoring and collective Q&A, and implemented the attitude of teaching knowledge, teaching people, and being responsible. Generally, lectures are given in the morning, and students practice design in the afternoon, with all teachers dispatched to provide guidance and individual assistance. In the evening, there is collective Q&A, systematically explaining the lecture content again. This allows students to accept theory, apply it in practice, and consolidate and digest it at the same time. For example, during tutoring, teacher Sun Wenjing used the most accessible examples to explain the meaning of "flow rate." He used "the bigger the mouth, the more water flows" to illustrate the relationship between flow rate and cross-section, and used the examples of pouring water from a teapot and releasing water from a hot water bucket to illustrate the relationship between flow rate and slope, and flow rate and head, making it easy for students to understand. This significantly improved the learning effect. For example, Zhou Xuxian, a student from Jiayu County, had only a primary school education and was older. He was not very confident at first, but after the teacher's enlightenment and help, he increased his confidence. He achieved excellent results in the exam. The factory building drawings he drew on a wobbly table without instruments were accurate and neat.

　　This training course has ended, training thirty-one water conservancy technical cadres for the Xiaogan Special District. Now they (except for one who is slightly weaker) can master a series of technical knowledge from surveying to design to installation and management of rural small hydropower stations below 200 kilowatts. The students have returned to their counties and have begun designing. Some are even designing medium-sized hydropower stations. (Li Yu)

　　武汉水利学院帮助地方培养技术干部
    本报讯　武汉水利学院最近派出教师到地方支援培训水利干部，以两周的时间，为孝感专区培训了一批水电站建设技术干部。
    根据武汉市和孝感专区签订的城乡互助合同，这个学院担负了为孝感专区设计几十个小型水电站的任务。孝感全专区要建设的水电站达六百多个，如果地方的技术力量不培养起来，是不易完成任务的，这样便决定了开办“超短期”的训练班。
    教师接到新的任务后，便制定教学计划，编写了通俗的教材七万字，并派出教师到各县实地踏勘，收集教学资料，他们夜以继日地干了七天便顺利完成了。开始时，教学上是存在不少困难的，学员来自各县，程度不齐，从小学到高中都有，大部分缺乏水利建设实际经验；加之期限短，对于这种新的训练方式没有现成经验，因而教师和学员信心都不很强。在这种情况下，教师们根据学以致用的原则，精选了教材，以水能利用计算的基本理论、水轮机及电气设备的型式选择、小型厂房的布置设计和木制水轮机木制水管的设计制作知识为教学基本内容；同时在教学方法上采取边学边练、个别辅导与集体答疑相结合的方法，贯彻了教书、教人和认真负责的态度。一般是上午讲课，下午学员练习设计，全体教师出动辅导，个别帮助；晚上是集体答疑，系统地再将讲课内容讲解一遍。使学员们一面接受理论、一面实际运用、一面巩固消化。如教师孙文镜在辅导时，举最通俗的例子说明了“流量”的涵义，他用“口愈大，水流得越多”来说明流量与断面的关系，用茶壶倒水和开水桶出水的例子说明流量与坡降、流量与水头的关系，使得学员明白易懂。这样做学习效果有了显著提高，如来自嘉鱼县的学员周绪显只有小学文化程度，年龄较大，初来时信心不高，经过教师启发帮助，增强了信心，在考试时成绩很好，在没有仪器和摇摇幌幌的桌子上画出来的厂房图既准确又整洁。
    这个训练班已结束，为孝感专区培养了三十一名水利技术干部，现在他们（除一人稍差外）都能自己掌握二百瓩以下农村小型水电站的从踏勘到设计以至于安装管理等一系列的技术知识了。学员们回县后都开始进行设计，有的还在设计中型水电站。（李育）
