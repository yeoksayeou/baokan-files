　　Convenient to Buy Books, Convenient to Read Books
　　Guangxi, Zhejiang and Other Provinces Establish Bookstores in Every Township

　　This newspaper reports that currently, following the wave of establishing factories and middle schools in every township, many regions have launched a surge in establishing bookstores in every township. Many counties in Guangxi, Zhejiang, Gansu, Shanxi, Jilin and other provinces have established a large number of people-run bookstores according to the general line for socialist construction of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better and more economic results.

　　Amidst the tide of technological revolution and cultural revolution, the masses' need for books has greatly increased. Although there are already more than 2,100 Xinhua bookstores and more than 15,700 supply and marketing cooperatives selling books nationwide, they still cannot fully adapt to the current situation of the Great Leap Forward. The masses felt it was inconvenient to buy books, so they decided to set up bookstores themselves. Under the advocacy of the BaiSha Township Party Committee in Yangshuo County, Guangxi, it only took the people one day and two nights to set up a bookstore. The houses, furniture, funds, and personnel were all solved by the masses themselves. GaoCheng Township, Xin County, Shanxi Province, raised 900 yuan from agricultural cooperatives to establish a "Red Flag Bookstore," which distributed more than 3,000 popular political, agricultural technology, and literary books in just five days. Li County, Gansu Province, worked hard day and night, and on the basis of the township cultural station, built 26 township bookstores without spending a penny. Together with the original two private bookstores, every township now has a book distribution point. From mid-June, each district and major market town in Qu County, Zhejiang Province, successively established private bookstores. The start-up costs of these bookstores (excluding operating funds) are generally only one or two yuan, the furniture is borrowed, and the houses are public houses of the district and township. The extensive establishment of private district and township bookstores in Dehui, Taonan, and Anguang in Jilin Province, Guixian and Yongning in Guangxi Province, and Yuzhong and Tianshui Prefectures in Gansu Province also has these characteristics. These private bookstores understand the needs of the masses and can enable book distribution to closely cooperate with politics and serve production. The salesperson of the private bookstore in Quantang District, Guixian County, Guangxi Province, went to the countryside to understand the needs of the masses. When he discovered that there were rice borers in the paddy fields, he took the initiative to send the book "Prevention and Control of Insect Pests of Crops" to the commune to help the agricultural cooperatives carry out the pest control campaign; he also selected 11 books on "Lathe Operation Method" and other books for the Hongguang Arts and Crafts Factory in Quantang Market to help them solve some difficulties in using lathes.

　　Party and government leading organs at all levels attach great importance to and support private bookstores. The Cultural, Educational, and Health Office of the Yuzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the requirements of the county's three-year plan for cultural revolution, notified the township party committees and people's committees to raise funds to establish township bookstores universally in July, and issued specific measures. The Taonan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the movement to vigorously promote the cultural revolution, put forward the requirements of "establishing bookstores in every township, having outlets in every cooperative, and having salesmen in every team," and called on all townships and cooperatives to "work hard for seven days and nights, mobilize the whole party, mobilize the whole people, and work hard for 20 days to train key personnel." The county's Culture and Education Section specially organized a short-term training class on book distribution. By July 11, 12 township bookstores had already started business. (Chen Xin)

　　Many private bookstores not only sell books, but also help agricultural cooperatives establish libraries, which plays a positive role in promoting the lively cultural life of the masses.

### 买书方便　看书方便　广西浙江等省乡乡办书店

　　买书方便　看书方便
　　广西浙江等省乡乡办书店
    本报讯　目前许多地区继乡乡办工厂、办中学之后，掀起了乡乡办书店的热潮。广西、浙江、甘肃、山西、吉林等省的许多县的区、乡根据多快好省的方针建立起大批民办书店。
    在技术革命和文化革命的浪潮中，群众对图书的需要有很大的增长，虽然全国已有二千一百多个新华书店和一万五千七百多个供销社卖书，仍不能完全适应当前的大跃进形势。群众感到买书不便，就决定自己动手开办书店。广西阳朔县白沙乡在乡党委的倡导下，只花了一天两夜的时间就办起了一个书店，房子、家具、资金、人员，都是群众自己解决的。山西忻县高城乡由农业社集资九百元，办了一个“红旗书店”，仅五天时间就发行了通俗的政治、农业技术和文艺书籍三千余册。甘肃礼县苦战一昼夜，在乡文化站的基础上，不花一文钱，就建成了二十六个乡书店，连原有的两个民办书店，乡乡都有了图书发行据点。浙江衢县各区和主要集镇从6月中旬开始陆续建立了民办书店。这些书店的开办费（不包括经营资金）一般都只一、二元，家具是借用的，房子是区、乡的公房。吉林德惠、洮南、安广，广西贵县、邕宁、甘肃榆中和天水专区各县民办区、乡书店的广泛建立，也都具有这样的特点。这些民办书店了解群众需要，能够使图书发行密切配合政治，服务生产。广西贵县覃塘区民办书店的营业员串乡了解群众的需要，当他发现禾田里有螟虫，就主动地把“农作物防止虫害法”一书送到社里去，帮助农业社开展了除虫运动；还为覃塘圩红光工艺厂选择了十一本有关“车床使用法”等书籍，帮助他们解决使用车床上的一些困难。
    各地党政领导机关对民办书店十分重视和支持。中共甘肃榆中县委文教卫生办公室就曾经根据县的文化革命三年规划的要求，通知各乡党委和人民委员会自筹资金，在7月份以内普遍建立乡书店，并发布了具体办法。中共吉林洮南县委在大兴文化革命的运动中，提出了“乡乡办书店，社社有门市，队队有推销员”的要求，号召各乡、社“苦战七昼夜，全党动手，全民动员；大干二十天，训练骨干”。县文教科专门举办了图书发行短期训练班。到7月11日，已经有十二个乡书店开始营业。　（陈新）
    许多民办书店不仅卖书，还帮助农业社建立图书室，对活跃群众文化生活，起着积极促进作用。
