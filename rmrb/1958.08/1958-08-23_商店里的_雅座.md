Market New Look

　　"Elegant Seating" in Stores
　　In many department stores, cotton fabric stores, confectionery stores, and vegetable markets on the streets of Chongqing, "elegant seating" can be found everywhere. This "elegant seating" is a place specially provided for customers to rest.
　　When customers go to buy things, the salespersons warmly welcome them to rest in the "elegant seating." The "elegant seating" is very clean and tidy, generally equipped with tables, chairs, and wooden benches. The tables have boiled water and newspapers; some even have cigarettes and fruit candies with marked prices, so customers can pay for and take the goods themselves. Salespersons also go to the "elegant seating" to introduce to customers the new varieties recently added to the store, what is sold here, and what is sold there. Some salespersons simply take the goods and help customers choose. The "elegant seating" in the Dayanggou Vegetable Market has a special person to buy vegetables for the elderly and pregnant women. The elderly and pregnant women rest in the "elegant seating," and the service staff buys the vegetables they need for them.
　　Chongqing is a mountain city, and the climate is particularly hot. Most of the population lives in the suburban industrial and mining areas. Customers travel from the suburbs to the city to buy goods, often sweating profusely. Therefore, this kind of "elegant seating" is particularly popular with customers. (Yi Dao) (Attached picture)

　　商店里的“雅座”
    在重庆街头的许多百货、棉布、糖果糕点商店和蔬菜市场里，到处设有“雅座”。这种“雅座”是专门供顾客休息的场所。
    顾客去买东西，售货员热情地把他们迎接到“雅座”去休息。“雅座”非常整洁，一般都设有桌、椅、木凳，桌上放着开水、报纸；有的还备有香烟和水果糖，标明价目，顾客可以自付钱自取货。售货员还到“雅座”旁向顾客介绍商店最近增添了什么新品种，这里卖什么，那里卖什么，有的售货员干脆拿着商品帮助顾客挑选。大阳沟菜市场里的“雅座”，特别设有专人为老人和孕妇买菜。老人和孕妇在“雅座席”上休息，服务员代他们买来了需要的蔬菜。
    重庆是个山城，气候特别热，大部分人口多住在市郊工矿区，顾客从郊外赶进城区买货，往往满头大汗。所以这种“雅座”，特别受到顾客欢迎。（宜道）（附图片）
