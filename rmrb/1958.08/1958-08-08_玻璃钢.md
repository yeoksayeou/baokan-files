Fiberglass

Recently, two particularly eye-catching "fiberglass" boats have been sailing on the tranquil waters of Beihai Park in Beijing. One is a speedboat, and the other is a lifeboat, both of which were gifts from the Ministry of Construction Engineering to the Beijing Children's Science and Technology Palace.

The main material of these two boats is the glass we see every day, which breaks easily when struck. However, by drawing the glass into very fine threads, finer than human hair, and then weaving them into fiberglass cloth, or directly using the threads and bonding them together with plastic, fiberglass of various shapes can be made.

Fiberglass has many excellent properties. Lightness is one of its characteristics, roughly one-third to one-quarter the weight of steel, and one-half the weight of aluminum alloy used in aircraft manufacturing. For example, compared to mild steel, fiberglass made from chopped glass fibers requires a three times larger cross-sectional area to withstand the same tensile force, but because it is light, its weight is only three-fifths of that of steel. At the same time, fiberglass has high impact resistance and is not easily damaged by impact. A half-inch thick fiberglass board is difficult to penetrate even with light machine gun bullets.

Plasticity is another important feature of fiberglass. It can be made into integral parts of various complex shapes, and the thickness of each part can be increased or decreased according to the forces it bears, saving material and reducing product weight. This is difficult for other materials to match. For example, although plastic can be molded into any shape, its strength is relatively low, and it often becomes brittle, especially at low temperatures, while fiberglass's strength even slightly increases at low temperatures.

Fiberglass also has good heat resistance. Its thermal insulation performance is much better than that of metal, two to three hundred times higher than steel, and more than a thousand times higher than aluminum. Its thermal expansion is similar to that of metal, so it can be connected to metal. General fiberglass can withstand temperatures below 100 degrees Celsius, and special fiberglass can withstand temperatures above 250 degrees Celsius.

Fiberglass will not deform due to climate changes, is not afraid of moisture, does not require corrosion protection or rust prevention, and is not afraid of general chemical corrosion. In terms of electrical insulation performance, it is comparable to plastic, but it makes up for the shortcomings of plastic's low strength and poor heat resistance. It can withstand several times higher voltage than insulating materials made of plastic and ordinary fibers.

Fiberglass is translucent. For example, transparent thin sheets made of polyester resin can transmit 70%-80% of light.

Due to its many excellent characteristics, the range of fiberglass's applications is expanding day by day. Because it is light and strong, it is used to make aircraft wingtips, fuel tanks, partitions, and ducts; it is also used in the manufacture of missiles. The electromagnetic properties and high mechanical strength of fiberglass make it particularly suitable for manufacturing radar housings. Because of its strong impact resistance, it can be used to make helmets, bulletproof vests, and other defense products.

Car bodies and chassis made of fiberglass are very light and convenient; an entire chassis can be lifted with one hand. Manufacturing bus bodies and other parts such as radiator grilles, dashboards, and pedals from fiberglass is lighter than using aluminum sheets.

Manufacturing ship hulls from fiberglass has many advantages. It can be made as a whole, reducing the amount of processing work, and it will not leak, rust, or rot, is not afraid of impact, and can be repaired after damage, so maintenance costs are very low. Laying a layer of fiberglass on the outside of ordinary wooden boats can greatly extend their service life.

Coal mine supports made of fiberglass pipes are more durable than wooden supports and lighter than cement supports, making them easy to move. Fiberglass can also be used to make high-pressure pipes and mine cars for hydraulic coal mining.

Because fiberglass has the characteristics of being corrosion-resistant and strong, it can be used to make various containers and pipelines for the chemical and petroleum industries, replacing precious metal materials. Fiberglass can also be used to make drill rods for drilling machines, and various electrical insulation materials for the motor industry, such as insulation boards, insulation coils, and so on.

In daily life, single-layer or double-layer fiberglass panels can be used to make prefabricated houses, which can insulate sound and heat, and weigh only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the weight of houses built with bricks and tiles. Building buildings with fiberglass can eliminate the need for large foundations because of their light weight. Transparent fiberglass is particularly suitable for building warehouses that cannot have windows but need sunlight. Fiberglass can also be used to make safety helmets, furniture, refrigerator and washing machine housings, bicycle frames, and suitcases.

It has only been a few months since China began trial-producing fiberglass, but many kinds of fiberglass products have already been made. We believe that this emerging industry, which has emerged in the last ten years and is considered one of the cutting-edge technologies, will surely blossom brilliantly in our country in the near future.

    玻璃钢

    在北京北海公园平静的水面上，最近航行着两只特别引人注意的“玻璃钢”小艇，其中一只是快艇，一只是救生艇，都是建筑工程部赠给北京少年科学技术宫的。
    这两只小艇的主要材料，就是我们每天都见到的一敲就碎的玻璃。但是，把玻璃拉成很细很细的、比人的头发还要细的丝，然后织成玻璃布，或者直接用丝加上塑料粘结在一起，就制成各种形状的玻璃钢。
    玻璃钢具有很多优异的特性。轻，是玻璃钢的特性之一，大致只有钢铁重量的三分之一到四分之一，只有制造飞机用的铝合金的重量的二分之一。例如用切短的玻璃丝做成的玻璃钢同软钢比较，在承受同样拉力的时候，玻璃钢的断面积需要比钢大三倍，但是由于它轻，重量却只有钢的五分之三。同时，玻璃钢耐冲击强度很高，在受冲击时很不容易碰坏。半寸厚的玻璃钢板，轻机枪子弹也不容易射穿。
    可塑性，是玻璃钢的又一个重要特点。它可以做成各种复杂形状的整体，而且可以根据各部分所受力量的不同，把一个地方加厚一点或减薄一点，既不浪费材料，又可减轻产品重量。这是其他材料很难和它相比的。例如塑料，虽然可以塑制成任何形状，但是强度比较低，尤其在低温的时候常要变脆，而玻璃钢在低温时强度还稍有增加。
    玻璃钢的耐热性能也很好。它在热绝缘性能方面要比金属好得多，比钢要高二、三百倍，比铝要高一千多倍；它受热后的膨胀情况和金属差不多，所以能够和金属相连接。一般的玻璃钢可以耐摄氏一百度以下的温度，特殊的可以耐热二百五十度以上。
    玻璃钢不会因为气候的变化而变形，也不怕潮，不需要防腐，不需要防锈，也不怕一般化学药品的侵蚀。在电绝缘性能方面，它可以和塑料相比，但它弥补了塑料强度低和不耐热的缺点。它比用塑料和普通纤维压制的绝缘材料能耐高几倍的电压。
    玻璃钢能透光。如用聚酯树脂做成的透明薄板可以透过70％—80％的光线。
    玻璃钢由于具有这么多优异的特点，它的使用范围一天天在扩大。因为它具有体轻和强度大的特点，人们便用它来做飞机的翼尖、油箱、间壁和导管；制造导弹也用它。玻璃钢的电磁性能和机械强度高的特性，使它特别适合于制造雷达的外罩。由于它的耐冲击性强，可以用来做钢盔、防弹衣等国防用品。
    用玻璃钢制造的小汽车外壳和底盘非常轻便，整个底盘可以用一只手举起来。用玻璃钢制造公共汽车外壳和其他各个部分，如散热器外罩、仪表盘、脚踏板等，比使用铝板还要轻。
    用玻璃钢制造船壳具有很多优点。它可以做成一个整体，减少加工工作量，并且不会渗水，不锈不烂，不怕冲碰，损坏后也可以修补，因此维护费用很低。在一般木船外面铺一层玻璃钢，就能大大地延长使用寿命。
    用玻璃钢管做的煤矿支柱，比木材支柱耐用，比水泥支柱轻，便于移动。用玻璃钢还可以做水力采煤的高压管道和矿车等。
    因为玻璃钢具有不怕腐蚀和强度高的特点，它可以做化学和石油工业上用的各种容器和管道，代替贵重金属材料。玻璃钢还可以做钻探机的钻杆，做电机工业上用的各种电绝缘材料，如绝缘板、绝缘电圈等等。
    在日用生活方面，用单层或夹层玻璃钢板可以做成装配式的房屋，既能隔音又能隔热，而且只有砖瓦建造的房屋的重量的十分之一或二十分之一。用玻璃钢建造楼房，因为重量轻，可以不需要很大的基础。透明的玻璃钢特别适合于建造不能开窗但又需要阳光的仓库。玻璃钢还可以做安全帽，做家具、电冰箱和洗衣机的外壳、自行车架，以及手提箱等。
    我国从开始试制玻璃钢，才不过几个月的时间，但是已经制出了许多种玻璃钢制品。我们相信，这个在最近十多年才出现的被认为是尖端技术之一的新兴工业，在不久的将来，一定会在我国开出灿烂的花朵来。（附图片）
