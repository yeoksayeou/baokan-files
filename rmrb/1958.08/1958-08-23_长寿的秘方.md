　　The Secret of Longevity
　　Wu Lü
    For those who subscribe to the "short lifespan of small blast furnaces" theory, the long-lived blast furnace at the Sipu Iron Plant in Yunnan Province is simply unimaginable. This small earth furnace, built with stones and reinforced with mud walls, has actually been in use for six years, and there is confidence that it can be used for another four years, which is truly "utterly absurd." However, the facts are clear, and you cannot deny them, so what can you do?

    Perhaps those who subscribe to the "short lifespan of small blast furnaces" theory can find another basis: "Longevity is always a rare thing; few people live past seventy, so how can every small blast furnace have a long life?" Regarding "few people live past seventy," in socialist countries, many facts have proven that this is an outdated "old almanac." In the Soviet Union before the revolution, the average lifespan of the people was only thirty-two years, but by last year it had reached sixty-four years. In socialist countries, how is living to seventy something "rare"? Let's not go into that in detail. Is the long-lived blast furnace at the Sipu Iron Plant really a "rare" blast furnace, and therefore just a coincidence? I don't think so. In the past, not many small blast furnaces were built, and it seems that this is the only one that has been in operation for six years and will continue for another four. But now, small blast furnaces are being developed on a large scale and are blooming everywhere, so there will not be few long-lived ones, but many.

    We are dialectical materialists. Dialectical materialists never treat chance and necessity as two mutually exclusive concepts. We believe that chance and necessity are interconnected. On the one hand, we admit that chance is also an objective existence, but we believe that necessity occupies a dominant position in social life, and chance is often the manifestation of necessity in a specific environment. "Victory or defeat is common in war," and there is chance here. But the victory or defeat of any battle has its necessity. Either you know yourself and your enemy and can defeat the enemy, or you misjudge the enemy's situation, make a wrong deployment, and the expedition is unfavorable. The small blast furnace at the Sipu Iron Plant has been in operation for six years and will continue for another four, which seems to be "rare," and seems to be just a coincidence; but in fact, it is inevitable: as long as you break superstitions, liberate your mind, and have great drive and dedication, you can master the laws of operating techniques and ensure that molten iron always flows smoothly.

    What is drive? Drive is revolutionary will. Some small blast furnaces are "weak and sick," and do not produce molten iron, which is the basis for the "short lifespan of small blast furnaces" theory. In fact, who can guarantee that they will not get sick in this world? Not to mention that small blast furnaces will have some failures, even large blast furnaces will inevitably have some failures. The question is how we deal with these failures. Do we lose heart first, become dispirited, and wait for death; or do we muster our energy, work hard, study diligently, and learn lessons and find solutions from the failures? Didn't the long-lived blast furnace at the Sipu Iron Plant also have days when it didn't produce molten iron? But they did not lose heart, did not give up, and always maintained a strong revolutionary will, and finally broke through the technical barrier of small blast furnaces. They can do it, so why can't others do it?

    Small blast furnaces can have a long life. If some comrades encounter difficulties in the production of small blast furnaces and doubt whether small blast furnaces can have a long life, then please take a dose of the secret recipe from the Sipu Iron Plant that makes small blast furnaces long-lived: muster your energy and study diligently.

　　长寿的秘方
　　吴滤
    云南省思普铁厂的长寿高炉，对于“小高炉短寿论”者说来，简直是件不可想像的事情。小小一座用石块砌成、用泥墙箍起的土高炉，居然能够用上六年，而且居然还有把握再用四年，真是“荒唐之极”。然而，事情明摆在那里，不容你不承认，这又有什么办法呢？
    或许，“小高炉短寿论”者还可以找出一条根据来：“长寿总是罕有的事情，人生七十古来稀，小高炉那能个个长寿？”关于“人生七十古来稀”，在社会主义国家里，已经被许多事实证明是过时了的“老皇历”。苏联在革命前，人民的平均寿命只有三十二岁，到去年已经有六十四岁了。人生七十，在社会主义国家里，哪是什么“古来稀”的事情？这且不去细谈。思普铁厂的长寿高炉究竟是不是“古来稀”高炉，因而只不过是一种偶然的现象呢？我看不是。过去小高炉没有建多少，六年长寿还要再干四年的，似乎只此一家。但现在小高炉大搞特搞，遍地开花，长寿的不会很少，而会很多。
    我们是辩证唯物主义者。辩证唯物主义者从来不把偶然性和必然性当作两个绝对排斥的概念。我们认为偶然性和必然性是互相联系的。一方面，我们承认偶然性也是一个客观存在，但我们更认为必然性在社会生活中占居统治地位，偶然性则常常是必然性在特定环境中的表现形式。“胜败乃兵家常事”，这里有偶然性。但任何一个战役的胜利和失败，又都有它的必然性。或则是知己知彼，克敌致胜；或则是对敌情估计错误，部署失策，出师不利。思普铁厂的小高炉长寿六年还要再干四年，看来真是“古来稀”，好像只是一个偶然的现象；但其实却是必然的：只要破除迷信，解放思想，干劲大，钻劲大，就能掌握操作技术的规律，使铁水永远畅流。
    干劲是什么呢？干劲就是革命意志。有些小高炉“体弱多病”，不流铁水，这是“小高炉短寿论”者立论的根据。其实，人生在世谁能保证自己不生病呢？不要说是小高炉会出些故障，就是大高炉有时也不免要出些故障。问题在于我们怎样对待这些故障。是先就泄了气，精神不振，束手待毙；还是鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，从故障中找出教训，找出办法。思普铁厂的长寿高炉不是也曾有过不流铁水的日子吗？但他们不灰心，不泄气，始终保持旺盛的革命意志，终于攻破了小高炉的技术关。他们能做到的，为什么别人不能做到呢？
    小高炉是可以长寿的。如果有些同志在小高炉生产中遇到困难，对小高炉能否长寿发生怀疑的话，那么，就请他们都来服一剂思普铁厂使小高炉长寿的秘方：鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研。
