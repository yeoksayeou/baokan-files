　　Sweet Potatoes to Produce Alcohol - Value Increases Hundredfold
　　Shandong Popularizes Yantai Distillery's Experience in Using Sweet Potatoes to Produce Alcohol
　　Sichuan Industrial Departments Prepare to Fully Utilize Sweet Potatoes to Manufacture Chemical Raw Materials

　　(Our report) Shandong Province is vigorously developing the alcohol industry and will have every commune distilling wine and every township promoting the wooden alcohol distillation tower recently successfully trial-produced by the Yantai Distillery, opening up broad uses for the soon-to-be-harvested sweet potatoes. The on-site conference on the liquor industry, which concluded on August 20, preliminarily determined that by the end of the year, the province would build 11,488 large and small distilleries (workshops); 2,400 county and township-run wooden and ceramic alcohol distillation towers with an annual output of 100 to 3,000 tons, producing 792,315 tons of alcohol.
　　Representatives from various regions attending the on-site conference reported that Shandong Province's 28 million mu of sweet potatoes planted this year would reap an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an estimated average yield of 4,000 jin per mu, totaling about 112 billion jin; after deducting uses for food, seeds, and starch, there would still be a considerable surplus. To prevent the sweet potatoes from rotting after a bumper harvest and causing losses to farmers, vigorously developing the alcohol industry using sweet potatoes as raw material has become an urgent task that brooks no delay. The on-site conference analyzed that using sweet potatoes to brew white liquor and then distilling it into alcohol would not only solve the problems of sweet potato surplus brought about by the bumper harvest and the backlog of white liquor from the past, but also elevate sweet potatoes, which have always been used as ordinary daily food, to the position of important industrial raw materials, which will play a great role in socialist construction.
　　According to the current technology, equipment, and requirements for alcohol purity, the conference representatives believed that the widespread promotion of the round wooden alcohol distillation tower, which the Yantai Distillery recently successfully trial-produced in seven days of hard work, is suitable. This distillation tower only requires about one cubic meter of wood and a small amount of tin. Four large oil drums can be used to replace the boiler. The structure is relatively simple, and the height is only seven meters, which is about half the height of a steel distillation tower. Townships and communes can all manufacture it themselves. In particular, this wooden distillation tower can distill alcohol that meets the prescribed purity. The alcohol initially distilled by the Yantai Distillery reached a purity of 93 degrees. A person in charge from the Ministry of Light Industry who came from Beijing specifically to attend the on-site conference said that this distillation tower is a relatively ideal type among many types of distillation towers in the country. With slight improvements, the alcohol purity can be raised to the standard of 95 degrees and can be used as fuel for automobiles and tractors.
　　After full discussion, more than 170 representatives from the prefectural, county, and municipal light industry bureaus and factories attending the meeting broke through the mysterious concept of manufacturing alcohol, formulated preliminary plans for building the alcohol industry in various regions, and determined that the nearly 50 old wineries in the province should be the backbone. Demonstrative distillation towers should first be built in each county in the shortest possible time, and then on-site conferences should be held to fully bloom and build all wineries and distillation towers in batches by the end of the year.
　　The five-day on-site conference, jointly convened by the Provincial Department of Light Industry, the Light Industry Trade Union, and the Handicraft Administration Bureau, called on various regions to adhere to the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical" when establishing the alcohol industry, mainly using indigenous methods, and boldly creating various simple brewing and alcohol distillation towers. At the same time, it emphasized that after the sweet potato harvest, various regions should still pay attention to the utilization of various substitutes, jump out of the circle of white liquor, study the comprehensive uses of sweet potatoes, provide more raw materials for the development of industry, open up sources of livestock feed and fertilizer for agriculture, and create more wealth for the country.

　　(Our report) Industrial and scientific research departments in Sichuan Province have used red sweet potatoes (i.e., sweet potatoes) to manufacture various chemical products and medicines.
　　Synthetic rubber uses alcohol and carbon black as its main raw materials. Sichuan has very abundant natural gas reserves, which are the best raw material for manufacturing carbon black; however, in the past, due to limited grain production, large quantities of alcohol could not be produced. This year, red sweet potatoes are abundant, and the relevant provincial departments are preparing to use red sweet potatoes to produce 300,000 tons of alcohol for use in synthetic rubber. Currently, industrial and scientific research departments are planning to establish a synthetic rubber factory and are preparing to develop rayon, synthetic fiber, and other organic synthetic chemical industries.
　　Sichuan's hog production is developing rapidly, but in the past, the raw material for manufacturing hog fattening medicine—glacial acetic acid—mostly needed to be imported from abroad. Now, in the comprehensive utilization of alcohol, Sichuan Province has successfully extracted acetaldehyde, glacial acetic acid, and ethyl acetate from alcohol. The main raw material for alcohol is the red sweet potatoes that are produced in large quantities in the province. Because of the success of this research, the cost of manufacturing hog fattening medicine will be greatly reduced, which is of great significance for promoting hog development.
　　Sichuan Province's industrial departments have successfully trial-manufactured maltose and invert sugar using red sweet potatoes instead of rice and sugarcane. Recently, employees of the Chengdu Pharmaceutical Factory have also used red sweet potatoes to extract glucose, citric acid, calcium lactate, lactic acid, activated carbon, hollyhock tablets, and monosodium glutamate. They publicly displayed these products, promoted them, and encouraged everyone to use their brains and use red sweet potatoes as raw material to manufacture more chemical products.
　　Sichuan Province's total output of red sweet potatoes this year is expected to reach 100 billion jin. At present, in order to ensure the large-scale needs of industrial departments, relevant departments are strengthening the work of red sweet potato storage and preliminary processing to solve the problem of normal supply in all seasons.

　　甘薯制酒精身价增百倍
    山东普遍推广烟台酿酒厂甘薯制酒精经验
    四川工业部门准备充分利用甘薯制造化工原料
    本报讯　山东省大搞酒精工业，将社社酿酒，乡乡推广烟台酿酒厂最近试制成功的木制酒精蒸馏塔，为即将丰收的甘薯开辟广阔的用途。8月20日结束的酒业现场会议初步确定，到年底全省要建设起一万一千四百八十八个大、小型白酒厂（坊）；年产一百至三千吨的县、乡办的木制、瓷制酒精蒸馏塔二千四百个，生产酒精七十九万二千三百一十五吨。
    参加现场会议的各地代表反映，山东省今年种植的二千八百万亩甘薯，将获得空前大丰收，预计平均每亩能产四千斤，总产量在一千一百二十亿斤左右；除去食用、种籽和淀粉等用途外，仍有相当数量的剩余。为防止丰收到手的甘薯腐烂，给农民造成损失，以甘薯为原料，大力发展酒精工业，就成为当前刻不容缓的迫切任务。现场会议分析，以甘薯酿成白酒，然后再蒸馏成酒精，不但解决了丰收带来的甘薯剩余和以往白酒积压等问题，而且把一向作为日常普通食用的甘薯，提升到重要的工业原料的位置上，这对社会主义建设将会起到很大的作用。
    根据目前的技术、设备和对酒精纯度的要求，会议代表认为，普遍推广烟台酿酒厂在最近苦干七昼夜试制成功的圆形木制酒精蒸馏塔是适宜的。这种蒸馏塔只需一立方左右的木材和少部的锡，锅炉用四只大油桶即可代替，构造比较简单，高度只有七公尺，比钢铁蒸馏塔约低一半，乡社都能动手制造。特别是这种木制蒸馏塔能蒸馏出合乎规定纯度的酒精，烟台酿酒厂在最初蒸馏出来的酒精，纯度即达到九十三度。特地从北京赶来参加现场会议的中央轻工业部的一位负责人说，这种蒸馏塔是目前全国很多类型的蒸馏塔中比较理想的一种；只要稍加改进，酒精纯度即可上升到九十五度的标准，能供作汽车、拖拉机的燃料之用。
    与会的各专署、县、市轻工业局和厂的一百七十多名代表在充分讨论后，破除制造酒精的神秘观念，制订了各地兴建酒精工业的初步规划，并确定：以全省近五十个老酒厂为骨干，最短时期内在各县首先建成示范性的蒸馏塔，然后召开现场会议，全面开花，分批于年底把酒厂、蒸馏塔全部建成。
    由省轻工业厅、轻工业工会、手工业管理局三个单位联合召开的五天现场会议，号召各地在建立酒精工业时，要按照多快好省的原则，以土法为主，大胆的创造各种简易的酿酒和酒精蒸馏塔。同时强调指出，在甘薯丰收后，各地仍要注意各种代用品的利用，并跳出白酒的圈子，研究甘薯的综合用途，为发展工业提供更多的原料；为农业开辟牲畜饲料和肥料的来源；为国家创造更多的财富。

    本报讯　四川省工业和科学研究部门用红苕（即甘薯）制造出多种化学产品和药品。
    合成橡胶是以酒精和碳黑作主要原料的。四川的天然气蕴藏量十分丰富，这是制造碳黑最好的原料；但是，过去由于粮食生产有限，不能生产大量酒精。今年红苕丰产，省有关部门准备用红苕生产三十万吨酒精，用来作合成橡胶。目前工业和科学研究部门正计划建立合成橡胶厂，并准备发展人造丝、合成纤维等有机合成化学工业。
    四川生猪发展很快，但是过去制造肥猪药的原料——冰醋酸，大部分需要从国外进口。现在四川省在研究酒精的综合利用中，从酒精中提取乙醛、冰醋酸和醋酸乙酯，已经成功。而酒精的主要原料却是本省大量生产的红苕，由于这项研究成功，使制造肥猪药的成本将大大降低，对促进生猪发展有很大意义。
    用红苕代替稻米、甘蔗制造饴糖、众糖，四川省工业部门已经试造成功。最近，成都制药厂职工又用红苕提制成葡萄糖、柠檬酸、乳酸钙、乳酸、活性炭、钬柠片、麸酸纽等药品。并把这些产品公开展览，推广介绍，鼓励大家开动脑筋，用红苕作原料制造出更多的化学产品。
    四川省今年红苕预计总产量将达一千亿斤。目前，为了保证工业部门大量需用，有关部门正从加强红苕保管、初步加工方面的工作，以解决四季正常供应。
