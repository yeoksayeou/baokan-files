Xinhua News Agency, Manila, August 13th: Alfredo Eugenio, the Philippine Civil Defense Chief, said on August 12th that radioactivity had been discovered on plants in and around Manila and nearby Quezon City.

　　Eugenio said that tests conducted last month definitely showed that atomic dust had fallen on these areas.

　　The frequent U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific region have resulted in countries in the Asian Pacific region discovering this harmful atomic dust one after another.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 12th (TASS): According to Japanese radio broadcasts, the scientific fishing boat "Hoei Maru" was recently sailing in the Pacific Ocean, conducting fishing research in a fishing ground 560 kilometers south of the U.S. nuclear weapons testing area. There were 25 crew members and 21 students on board.

　　After the ship returned to a Japanese port, the diagnosis of a sick engine management worker proved that his white blood cell count was half that of a normal person. The white blood cell count of ten other Japanese people who were diagnosed was also greatly reduced. (Attached picture)

　　The Japanese ship "Takuyo" suffered from the atomic dust scattered by the U.S. nuclear weapons tests. The picture shows the inspection of radiation infection on the deck.

　　美试验核武器祸患不浅
　　菲发现原子微尘　日渔船人员又遭害
    新华社13日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾民防负责人艾尔弗雷多·欧亨尼奥8月12日说，已经发现马尼拉和附近的奎松城四周的植物上面带有放射性。
    欧亨尼奥说，上个月进行的试验肯定地表明，这些地方落下了原子微尘。
    美国最近在太平洋地区频繁进行的核试验，使得亚洲的太平洋地区国家都先后发现了这种为害人类的原子微尘。
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社东京12日讯：据日本电台广播，科学捕鱼船“凤荣丸”不久前在太平洋中航行，这艘船在美国进行核武器试验地区以南五百六十公里的鱼场从事捕鱼研究工作。这艘船上有二十五名船员和二十一名学生。
    在这艘船回到日本港口后，对一个患病的马达管理工人病情的诊断证明，他的白血球比正常人减少了一半。其他十个经过诊断的日本人的白血球也都大大地减少了。（附图片）
