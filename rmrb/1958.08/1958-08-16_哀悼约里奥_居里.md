　　Mourning Joliot-Curie
    Comrade Joliot-Curie, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, a prominent contemporary scientist, and chairman of the World Peace Council, passed away in Paris on the 14th after a serious illness. This is a great loss for the French people, the world peace movement, and the world's progressive scientific community. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said in a telegram to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party expressing condolences for the death of Comrade Joliot-Curie: "We are deeply saddened to hear the unfortunate passing of Comrade Joliot-Curie, a loyal son of the French working class, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, a prominent contemporary scientist, and chairman of the World Peace Council, on August 14th. We express our condolences." This expresses the Chinese people's immense grief at the passing of this beloved fighter, and expresses our deep condolences!
    The life of Comrade Joliot-Curie was one of struggle for the cause of peace, democracy, and progress by a progressive intellectual.
    Comrade Joliot-Curie engaged in scientific research early in his life, and he shone brightly in the study of atomic science. However, he himself said that he only began to engage in this scientific work after making the cause of defending peace the goal of his research. Therefore, when he saw the imperialists using atomic energy to launch aggression and bring the threat of death to humanity, he disregarded the persecution of the reactionaries in the United States and France and bravely dedicated his entire life to the peaceful use of atomic energy and the lasting peace of the world.
    Joliot-Curie did not confine his activities solely to the laboratory. During World War II, when his motherland was trampled upon by German fascists, he, as a great patriot, resolutely left his laboratory and joined the French people's resistance movement. He participated in the creation and leadership of the underground organization "National Front," uniting many French people with different political views and religious beliefs, and carried out a resolute struggle against the German invaders. It was in those harsh war years that Joliot-Curie joined the French Communist Party and dedicated himself to the noble cause of communism.
    Due to Joliot-Curie's outstanding contributions to the cause of peace, democracy, and progress, he became one of the world's recognized outstanding leaders of the peace movement after World War II. He was repeatedly elected chairman of the World Peace Council, working tirelessly with leaders of the peace movement from various countries to strive for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, opposition to wars of aggression, and the maintenance of world peace. For his outstanding contributions to the world peace movement, Joliot-Curie was awarded the International Lenin Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" in 1951. Even in recent years, when he was seriously ill, Joliot-Curie devoted his most fervent concern to the world peace movement. Just recently, in a letter to the "Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation," he firmly advocated that "governments of all countries should finally be forced to turn the will of the people of all countries to demand peace and disarmament into concrete actions." He also passionately said: "I believe I have an urgent responsibility to raise the issue every time I have the opportunity, and I want to emphasize again that it is absolutely necessary to stop nuclear weapons testing." Joliot-Curie's spirit of dedicating himself to the cause of world peace and human progress is highly admirable.
    Joliot-Curie was a beloved friend of the Chinese people. He established cooperation with Chinese scientists long ago. In the world peace movement, he and the leaders of China's peace movement fought side by side for a common cause. The Chinese people will always remember this outstanding peace fighter and beloved friend.
    Today, the forces for world peace are stronger than ever. However, the cause of world peace for which Joliot-Curie fought his entire life is still threatened by imperialist aggressors. The aggression of British and American imperialism in the Middle East puts the people of the world in danger of war. At the same time, the United States, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, continues to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean, and some American soldiers are even clamoring for the use of atomic weapons. All peace-loving people around the world must inherit and carry forward Joliot-Curie's heroic and tenacious spirit of fighting for peace, further strengthen unity, resolutely struggle, force British and American imperialism to withdraw their troops from the Middle East, force the United States and Britain to stop testing nuclear weapons, and not allow imperialism to provoke new wars. This is the best way to commemorate our beloved friend and outstanding peace fighter, Joliot-Curie.

　　哀悼约里奥——居里
    法国共产党中央委员、当代著名的科学家、世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里同志，在重病之后14日在巴黎逝世。这是法国人民、世界和平运动和世界进步科学界的重大损失。中共中央在致法共中央吊唁约里奥—居里同志的电报里说：“惊闻法国工人阶级忠实的儿子、法国共产党中央委员、当代著名的科学家、世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里同志于八月十四日不幸逝世，我们不胜悲悼之至，特电吊唁。”这表达了中国人民对这位敬爱的战士的逝世感到无比的悲痛，并且表示深切的哀悼！
    约里奥—居里同志的一生，是一个进步知识分子为和平、民主和进步事业而奋斗的一生。
    约里奥—居里同志早年即从事科学的研究工作，并且在原子科学的研究中放出了异彩。然而，他自己说，他是在把保卫和平的事业当作自己研究工作的目的之后，才从事这门科学工作的。因此，当他看到帝国主义者要把原子能用来发动侵略，给人类带来死亡威胁的时候，他就不顾美国和法国的反动派的迫害，勇敢地为和平利用原子能，为世界的持久和平而贡献了自己的整个生命。
    约里奥—居里并未把自己的活动仅仅限于研究室中。在第二次世界大战期间，他的祖国被德国法西斯践踏的时候，他作为一个伟大的爱国主义者，毅然走出自己的研究室，参加了法国人民的抗敌运动，并且参加创建和领导了“民族阵线”的地下组织，团结了许多政治观点和宗教信仰不同的法国人，为反抗德国侵略者进行了坚决的斗争。就在那样严酷的战争年代里，约里奥—居里参加了法国共产党，献身于崇高的共产主义事业。
    由于约里奥—居里在争取和平、民主和进步事业方面的卓越的贡献，在第二次世界大战后，他就成为世界公认的和平运动的杰出的领导者之一。他一再被选为世界和平理事会主席，同各国从事和平运动的领导者一起，为争取裁军、禁止原子武器、反对侵略战争和维护世界和平而进行不懈的努力。由于在世界和平运动方面的卓越的贡献，约里奥—居里曾于1951年荣获“加强国际和平”国际列宁奖金。约里奥—居里即使在近年重病中，也对世界和平运动寄与最大的热诚的关怀。就在不久以前，他在给“裁军和国际合作大会”的信件中，坚决主张应该“迫使各国政府最后不得不把各国人民要求和平和裁军的意志变成具体的行动”。他并且热情地说：“我认为我有迫切的责任每次有机会就要提出，我愿再一次强调，绝对必须停止核武器试验。”约里奥—居里为世界和平和人类进步事业鞠躬尽瘁的精神，是非常值得敬佩的。
    约里奥—居里是中国人民的敬爱的朋友。他早就同中国科学家建立了合作。在世界和平运动中，他又同我国的和平运动领导者并肩为共同的事业而斗争。中国人民永远怀念着这位卓越的和平战士和敬爱的朋友。
    今天，世界和平力量空前强大。然而约里奥—居里为之奋斗一生的世界和平事业却仍然受到帝国主义侵略者的威胁。美英帝国主义在中东的侵略，使世界人民面临战争危险。与此同时，美国不顾世界人民的和平愿望，仍然继续在太平洋试验核武器，甚至某些美国军人还在叫嚣使用原子武器。全世界爱好和平的人民，必须承继和发扬约里奥—居里为和平而斗争的英勇顽强的精神，更加加强团结，坚决斗争，迫使美英帝国主义从中东撤军，迫使美英停止试验核武器，不许帝国主义挑起新的战争。这是对我们敬爱的朋友、卓越的和平战士约里奥—居里的最好的纪念。
