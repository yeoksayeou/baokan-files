　　Thermonuclear Energy - The Foundation of Future Power
　　Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences, I.V. Kurchatov
　　At the beginning of the twentieth century, mankind achieved a great victory in science: technically solving the problem of utilizing the massive energy of heavy nuclei - uranium and thorium. However, the reserves of this fuel used in atomic boilers are not large in the strata. If all the power on earth were converted to this power, then, given the modern rate of growth in power needs, uranium and thorium would only be enough for one or two hundred years, and within the same period, the reserves of coal and oil would also be exhausted.

　　The second half of the twentieth century will be the century of thermonuclear energy.
　　Now, the task before science and technology is to make thermonuclear reactions a controllable and stable process.
　　The second half of the twentieth century will be the century of thermonuclear energy. In thermonuclear reactions, energy will be released in the process of hydrogen converting into helium. The first rapid thermonuclear reactions were achieved in the hydrogen bombs of our country, the United States, and Britain. Now, the task before science and technology is not to carry out thermonuclear reactions explosively, but to make thermonuclear reactions a controllable and stable process. Solving this problem will allow the use of the earth's abundant hydrogen as nuclear fuel.
　　Thermonuclear reactors do not use ordinary hydrogen, but heavy hydrogen. It is easier to carry out thermonuclear reactions using a mixture of equal amounts of heavy hydrogen (or deuterium, i.e., hydrogen with an atomic weight of 2) and super-heavy hydrogen (or tritium, i.e., hydrogen with an atomic weight of 3). In nature, super-heavy hydrogen is quite rare. To manufacture the required amount of super-heavy hydrogen, one must rely entirely on nuclear reactions from neutron irradiation, but this is an expensive manufacturing process. It seems that thermonuclear reactors that work with pure heavy hydrogen have promising development prospects and significant meaning. Heavy hydrogen is very abundant in nature; there is one heavy hydrogen nucleus in every six thousand ordinary hydrogen nuclei. Therefore, one liter of ordinary water is equivalent to four hundred liters of oil in terms of energy. Simple calculations show that even with vigorous power development, heavy hydrogen fuel will be sufficient for mankind for tens of millions of years. With the establishment of thermonuclear reactors, there will practically be no need to worry about fuel.
　　In the next fifteen years, our country's annual production of coal and oil will reach about one billion tons. And so much oil and coal can be replaced by only four hundred tons of heavy hydrogen. Twenty years ago, this quantity could only be described as an incomparably large and unattainable quantity. I remember that before the war, when we were working on the Leningrad cyclotron, it was very difficult to obtain a few grams of heavy hydrogen because at that time, the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Dnepropetrovsk was using laboratory methods to produce heavy water. However, our current situation is very different. We are now industrially producing heavy water. There are various production methods. Among these methods, it is worth mentioning the deep freezing method, which is the process of producing heavy water at a temperature of minus two hundred and fifty degrees Celsius. This more advanced method was created by the Institute of Physical Problems of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
　　The cost of extracting heavy hydrogen from water is not high. If heavy hydrogen can be used as fuel, its price will be less than 1% of the price of coal.
　　What will a thermonuclear reactor be like? Calculations show that it should be possible to heat heavy hydrogen to 300-400 million degrees or heat a mixture of heavy hydrogen and super-heavy hydrogen to 40-50 million degrees in the reactor. Only at such high temperatures can the fusion of hydrogen nuclei proceed so intensely that the energy released is greater than the energy lost due to heating the hydrogen (including radiation losses). Only at such high temperatures can the "thermonuclear furnace" compete with boilers using coal and oil.
　　Now let's look at the conditions required to heat hydrogen to hundreds of millions of degrees.
　　At room temperature and normal pressure, ordinary heavy hydrogen gas molecules move at speeds of over five thousand kilometers per hour. The gas is loaded into a container (the material of the container must be able to withstand high temperatures and high pressures), and then the gas is heated to one hundred thousand degrees. At such high temperatures, the pressure of the gas is approximately one thousand five hundred atmospheres, and the heavy hydrogen atoms dissociate into positively charged heavy hydrogen nuclei and electrons. Thus, the gas is completely ionized. Physicists call matter in this state "plasma." Heavy hydrogen nuclei will move at speeds of almost one hundred thousand kilometers per hour. However, the energy of the heavy hydrogen nuclei is still insufficient to overcome their mutual repulsion. At a temperature of one hundred thousand degrees, only two nuclear transitions occur in one liter of heavy hydrogen plasma in a thousand years.
　　Now we raise the temperature to one hundred million degrees. The speed of the heavy hydrogen nuclei reaches a very large value - one thousand kilometers per second. All heavy hydrogen nuclei react with each other in a fraction of a second. One liter of plasma will release an unimaginable one hundred million kilowatts of power. We are almost reaching the conditions under which it is possible to generate a self-sustaining thermonuclear reaction in heavy hydrogen. At this time, the pressure of the plasma is fifteen million atmospheres, so it is clear that under such conditions, it is impossible to consider a thermonuclear reactor using heavy hydrogen at normal density as fuel. In a thermonuclear reactor, the density of the gas should be kept very low; the number of particles per unit volume should not exceed a few hundred thousandths of the number of particles of a gas under normal pressure and temperature. Even in this case, due to the very high temperature, the pressure of the plasma will be several tens of atmospheres.
　　At first glance, the problem of building a thermonuclear reactor is unsolvable, because even at a temperature of three thousand degrees, there is no refractory material that can withstand large mechanical loads. The complexity of the problem also lies in the fact that the scorching plasma cannot be close to the wall, because the rapid evaporation of the wall will immediately cool the plasma, and as a result, the reaction will stop. To heat hydrogen to hundreds of millions of degrees, it is necessary to build a reliable thermal insulation to prevent the hydrogen from approaching the container wall.

　　Plasma allows people to solve the difficulty of controlling thermonuclear reactions.
　　The wonderful thing is that the characteristics of plasma - a completely ionized gas - make it possible for us to find a way to solve the above-mentioned enormous difficulties in principle. Thermal insulation can be established with the aid of a magnetic field, because the magnetic field can be used to prevent charged particles from moving freely across the magnetic lines of force.
　　The main part of the thermonuclear reactor is a completely sealed chamber. Before the reaction is "ignited," the sealed chamber is evacuated, so that the residual pressure of the air does not exceed a few tens of millions of atmospheres. The plasma should be "suspended" in the reactor body, and the magnetic field should be used to prevent the plasma from approaching the wall. In order to control the expansion of the hot plasma, there is no need to use walls made of any material at all. The plasma can be controlled by the magnetic field, and since the plasma also generates force transmitted to the outer coil, the current generated along the outer coil creates a magnetic field in the reactor.
　　There is another method of thermal insulation. If a strong current passes through the plasma, the magnetic field generated by this current can be used as the main means of thermal insulation. For this purpose, there must be a thick chamber wall made of conductive material. The plasma is surrounded by a magnetic field, and current flows along the plasma. If the current is pulse-excited, its magnetic field will not quickly penetrate the metal body, so the plasma will not be close to the wall. For example, it takes about one second for the magnetic field generated on the surface of copper to penetrate ten centimeters into the copper. Therefore, this thick-walled chamber has been technically adopted, so that the magnetic field generated by the current flowing along the plasma can guarantee thermal insulation for more than one second. At this time, the pressure of the heated plasma is not transmitted to the wall by molecular collisions as in cold gas, but by the magnetic field generated by the current flowing through the plasma.
　　We are all familiar with the fact that very hot objects emit light and heat.
　　If the intensity of light and heat emitted by hot hydrogen is the same as that of a solid, then at a temperature of millions of degrees, its radiation will instantly turn any substance into vapor, to the extent that any cooling method technically possible so far cannot prevent this rapid evaporation. However, in reality, hot hydrogen plasma is transparent, many times more transparent than a solid. The light and heat it emits is also much smaller. The intensity of radiation from a reactor thermal zone with a linear size of one meter at a temperature of 50 million degrees and hydrogen plasma density is equivalent to the intensity of radiation from a solid of the same size at a high temperature of 5,000 degrees. Even so, this is still a huge energy flow. Designers of thermonuclear reactors need to seriously study how to derive this huge energy flow. But the thermal zone we see with our eyes will only have a very weak luminous power, because the energy flow is basically composed of ultraviolet rays and X-rays.
　　Any thermonuclear reactor will lose some energy in order to maintain its working state. As the volume of the reactor increases, the energy released in the reactor grows faster than the energy loss. Therefore, in order for a thermonuclear reactor to generate more energy than it loses, its size has a minimum limit. The minimum size of a reactor using a mixture of heavy hydrogen and super-heavy hydrogen as a fuel seems to be about one meter for its active zone, and a reactor using pure heavy hydrogen is larger. Obviously, pure heavy hydrogen thermonuclear reactors are only suitable for stationary large-capacity power stations.
　　Thermonuclear reactors can be used as a heat source for generating steam, which passes through steam turbines in general circuits to generate electricity, but it is also possible to directly obtain electricity from the reactor.
　　Thermonuclear reactors can be used as a heat source for generating steam, which passes through steam turbines in general circuits to generate electricity, but it is also possible to directly obtain electricity from the reactor without going through the process of intermediate thermal circuits with low effective action coefficients. As early as 1954, the Institute of Atomic Energy of the USSR Academy of Sciences noticed this, and the plan elaborated by G.I. Budker is one of them. The theoretical basis for this possibility is that more than two-thirds of the energy in heavy hydrogen plasma is released in the form of the kinetic energy of charged particles. Charged particles are controlled by magnetic fields, so it is not difficult to see that it is possible to convert the kinetic energy of particles into electrical energy directly. For example, pulsating current can be obtained by the following method. Suppose the plasma is controlled by an external magnetic field, which is generated by the current in the shell of the entire thermonuclear generator. If the magnetic field is slightly increased, the plasma is further compressed, and its temperature and density increase accordingly. As a result, the thermonuclear reaction proceeds faster, and the plasma is heated more. The plasma begins to expand, thus causing cooling, and pulling the magnetic field out of the reactor volume. The magnetic lines of force pass through the shell, resulting in a current in the shell. Under certain working conditions, the energy of this current will be greater than the energy lost to compress the plasma.
　　The construction of controllable thermonuclear reactors began in the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States almost simultaneously.
　　In 1950, Academician A.D. Sakharov and Academician I.B. Tamm proposed the first model of a magnetic thermonuclear reactor, laying the foundation for Soviet research in this area. Since then, we have divided into many directions for research in this area. Currently, several groups of scientists and engineers are engaged in this work. The work published in 1956 was led by Academician L.A. Artsimovich and Academician M.A. Leontovich at the Institute of Atomic Energy of the USSR Academy of Sciences. A.M. Andriyanov, O.I. Bazilevskaya, S.I. Braginsky, I.N. Golovin, S.Yu. Lukyanov, S.M. Osovets, I.M. Potgorni, V.I. Sinnitsyn, N.V. Filimbervie, N.A. Yavlinsky, and other researchers completed a certain research direction. In these works, dilute heavy hydrogen was heated to more than one million degrees with a current of two million amperes in the so-called rapid process. At this time, the emission of neutrons was observed.
　　In the past six months, the British Atomic Energy Authority has regularly reported that the installation and operation of the experimental thermonuclear device "ZETA" (i.e., "Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly") at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Institute has been completed.
　　An article describing the "ZETA" device and some of the results of the experiments conducted on this device was published in the January 24 issue of "Nature" magazine.
　　The "ZETA" device is used to study the conditions for maintaining ionized hydrogen with a magnetic field, which is generated by the current flowing through the hydrogen gas, and to study how to obtain the high temperature required to generate nuclear reactions in heavy hydrogen.
　　"ZETA" is a sealed chamber made of an aluminum tube with a diameter of one meter. The tube is annular, with an average diameter of three meters. The chamber is filled with heavy hydrogen, and the pressure ranges from one millionth to several millionths of an atmosphere. There is current in the gas, with an intensity of two hundred thousand amperes. The current heats the gas, and the magnetic field of the current prevents the gas from expanding and the gas from being close to the metal wall of the chamber.
　　The "ZETA" device was manufactured by P. Thonemann, D. Fry, W. Thomson, and some scientific researchers at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Institute under the leadership of the well-known British physicist John Cockcroft. The device was designed by the "Metropolitan Vickers" Electrical Company. British physicists believe that they have successfully heated heavy hydrogen to more than five million degrees and can keep heavy hydrogen away from the wall for a few thousandths of a second. Neutron radiation has been observed during this time. "ZETA" is a well-designed experimental device. British physicists have conducted a series of experiments on it, but the results obtained are not enough to illustrate a clear picture of the phenomena occurring in the chamber. Another similar device in Britain was built by physicists at Aldermaston under the leadership of Dr. Alipant. The article reported that they had obtained temperatures above four million degrees on this device.
　　When building "ZETA", scientists did not intend to obtain energy from thermonuclear reactions. When experiments are performed on the device, the energy released is trillions of times smaller than the energy lost to maintain the working state.
　　The Soviet youth theorist Shafranov has made a complete theory of stability research. The Soviet Union will introduce the research situation at the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy to be held this year.
　　Physicists and engineers from various countries still have to work hard to first clarify the ways to industrially use thermonuclear energy.
　　In "ZETA", the discharge column through which current passes is kept in a stable state by the action of a weak external magnetic field generated by coils wound around the chamber. In 1953, the Soviet youth theorist Shafranov made a complete theory of the stability of discharge columns similar to those on "ZETA".
　　We are also studying discharges in circular chambers in our country, but the scheme is different from the British one. We want to introduce this work at the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy to be held in Geneva this year.
　　The American article published in the same issue of "Nature" magazine does not describe any fundamentally new facts. American physicists have observed neutron radiation in high-power pulsed discharges, but the radiation intensity mentioned in the article is much smaller than the intensity observed by physicists at the Institute of Atomic Energy of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
　　The articles published in the magazine are not commensurate with the scale of American work in this area. There are now at least five huge scientific centers in the United States specializing in controllable thermonuclear reaction problems, with nearly five hundred scholars participating in this work, including the great American physicist and hydrogen bomb manufacturer E. Teller. Until now, most of the work carried out by various countries in controllable thermonuclear reactions remains confidential. Thermonuclear reactors can be used not only for peaceful purposes, but also for military purposes, because controllable fissionable uranium and plutonium needed to make atomic bombs can be obtained with the help of thermonuclear reactors. Before the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons is prohibited, it is difficult to expect scientists from various countries engaged in controllable thermonuclear reaction research to achieve openness.

　　热核能——未来动力的基础
　　苏联科学院院士　И·В·库尔恰托夫
    二十世纪初叶，人类在科学上取得了巨大的胜利：在技术上解决了利用重原子核——铀和钍的大量能的问题。但是，原子锅炉中所用的这种燃料在地层中的储藏量是并不大的。假如地球上的全部动力转换为这种动力的话，那末，在近代对动力需要的增长速度的情况下，铀和钍只够用一、二百年，而在同一个时期内煤和石油的储藏也将会用尽。
　　下半个二十世纪将是热核能的世纪
    现在，放在科学技术面前的任务是：使热核反应成为可控制的平稳地进行的过程。
    下半个二十世纪将是热核能的世纪。在热核反应里，在氢转变为氦的过程中将会释放出能来。最初快速的热核反应是在我国、美国和英国的氢弹中实现的。现在，放在科学技术面前的任务是：不是爆炸式地来进行热核反应，而是使热核反应成为可控制的平稳地进行的过程。解决这一问题以后就可以利用地球上的大量的氢作为原子核燃料。
    在热核反应堆中用的并不是普通氢，而是重氢。用等量的重氢（或氘，即原子量为2的氢）和超重氢（或氚，即原子量为3的氢）所组成的混合物来进行热核反应是较为容易的事情。在自然界中，超重氢是相当少的。要制造所需数量的超重氢就必须完全借助于中子照射?的核反应，但是这是一个价钱昂贵的制造过程。看来，利用纯重氢来工作的热核反应堆倒是很有发展前途与重大意义的。在自然界中重氢是十分充足的，在六千个普通氢原子核中就有一个重氢原子核。因而一升普通水按其能量来说就相当于四百公升的石油。简单的计算表明，即使在动力蓬勃发展的情况下，重氢燃料将足够人类用几万万年。随着热核反应堆的建立，在实际上再也用不着担心燃料的问题了。
    在最近十五年内，我国煤和石油的年产量将达到十亿吨左右。而这么许多的石油和煤只需四百吨重氢就可以代替。二十年以前，这个数量还只能说是一个大得不可比拟的和难以达到的数量。我记得，战前我们在列宁格勒回旋加速器上工作时，要想得到几克重氢是十分困难的事，因为当时在德?波尔彼得洛夫斯克的乌克兰科学院物理化学研究所是用实验室方法制造重水的。可是，我们现在的情况就大不同了。现在我们已经工业生产重水。生产的方法是多种多样的。在这些方法中值得提出的是深度冷冻法，也就是生产重水的过程是在摄氏零下二百五十度的条件下进行的。这种较为先进的方法是由苏联科学院物理问题研究所所创造的。
    从水中提取重氢的成本是不大的。能用重氢作为燃料的话，则它的价格比煤的价格的1％还要低一些。
    热核反应堆将是怎样的呢？计算表明，在反应堆中应有可能把重氢加热到3—4亿度或把重氢、超重氢的混合物加热到4—5千万度。只有在这样的高温下才能使氢原子核的融合进行得如此强烈，以致使所放出的能量大于因加热氢而损耗掉的能量（包括辐射损耗在内）。也只有在这样的高温度下，“热核火塞”的锅炉才能与用煤和石油的锅炉相竞争。
    现在来看一看把氢加热到几亿度所必须具备的条件。
    在室温和正常的压力下，普通的重氢气体分子是以每小时五千公里以上的速度运动着的。把气体装入容器中（容器的材料要能够耐高温和高压），然后再把气体加热到十万度。在这样的高温下，气体的压力大约为一千五百大气压，重氢的原子离解成为带正电的重氢原子核和电子。这样，气体就完全被游离。处在这种状况下的物质，物理学家们称之为“等离子气体”。重氢原子核几乎将以每小时十万公里的速度运动着。但重氢原子核的能量仍然不足以克服它们之间的相互斥力。在十万度的高温下，在一千年中，一升重氢等离子气体仅仅只发生两次原子核转变。
    现在我们把温度升高到一亿度。重氢原子核的速度也就达到十分巨大的数值——每秒一千公里。在几分之几秒钟内所有的重氢核互相反应。一升等离子气体就会放出难以想像的一亿瓩的功率。我们就差不多达到有可能在重氢中产生自动维持的热核反应的条件。这时，等离子气体的压力为一千五百万大气压，因而很明显，在这样的条件下就无法考虑什么利用一般密度下的重氢作为燃料的热核反应堆。在热核反应堆中气体的密度应保持十分小，单位体积内的粒子数不应超过处在普通压力和温度下的气体的粒子数的几十万分之一。即使在这样的情况下，由于温度相当高，等离子气体的压力也将是几十个大气压。
    乍一看，建造热核反应堆的问题是无法解决的，因为就是在三千度的高温下也还没有一种耐火材料足以能够耐受大的机械负荷。问题的复杂性还在于灼热的等离子气体是不能与壁挨近的，因为壁的快速蒸发会使等离子气体立即冷却，结果反应就会停止。要把氢加热到几亿度，就必须建造一个可靠的热绝缘，不使氢挨近容器壁。
    等离子气体使人们能够解决控制热核反映的困难
    事情很妙，等离子气体——完全被游离的气体的特性，使我们有可能找到原则上解决上述巨大困难的途径。热绝缘可借助于磁场来建立，因为利用磁场可以使带电粒子不能自由地横穿磁力线而运动。
    热核反应堆的主要部分是一个完全密封的室。在“点燃”反应之前，先将此密封室抽真空，使空气的剩余压力不超过大气压力的几千万分之一。等离子气体应“悬挂”在反应堆体内，用磁场使等离子气体不与壁挨近。为了控制热等离子气体的扩张，完全用不着用任何材料做成的壁。等离子气体可由磁场加以控制，而由于等离子气体也产生力传递到外壳线圈上，然后，沿着外壳线圈所发生的电流在反应堆中造成了磁场。
    还有另外一种热绝缘的方法。假如有强电流通过等离子气体，那末由这个电流所造成的磁场就可用来作为热绝缘的主要手段。为此就必须有一个导体材料制的厚的室壁。在等离子气体四周则围有磁场，电流沿着等离子气体流过，假如电流是脉冲式激发产生的，那末，它的磁场就不会很快地穿入金属体内，因而不使等离子气体与壁挨近。例如，在铜的表面上所造成的磁场要深入铜内十厘米约需一秒钟。所以，在技术上已采用这种厚壁室，以便使沿等离子气体流过的电流所造成的磁场能保证热绝缘达到一秒多钟之久。这时，被加热的等离子气体的压力并不像在冷气体中那样用分子碰击的方法，而是用穿过等离子气体流过的电流所造成的磁场的方法传递到壁上的。
    我们都很熟悉，非常热的物体会发出光和热来。
    假如热氢发出的光和热的强度如同固体一样，那末在温度为百万度的情况下，它的辐射在一刹那之间就会使任何物质转为蒸气，以至于迄今技术上所能做到的任何冷却方法都不能防止这种快速蒸发。不过，实际上热氢等离子气体是透明的，它比固体透明多少倍。它所发出的光和热也就小多少倍，线性大小为一米的反应堆热区在温度为五千万度和氢等离子气体密度情况下所辐射出的强度，与同一大小的固体在五千度的高温下所辐射出的强度是相当的。虽然这样，这仍然是一个巨大的能量流。要导出这一巨大的能量流，尚需热核反应堆的设计师们加以认真的研究。但是我们用眼睛所看到的热区将只是发光能力很弱的，因为能量流基本上是由紫外线和伦琴射线所组成。
    无论那一个热核反应堆，为了要维持它的工作状况，都会损耗掉一部分能量。随着反应堆的体积的增大，堆中放出的能量的增长比能量的损耗要快。所以要使热核反应堆所产生的能量比损耗的多，其尺寸有一个最小的限度，用重氢和超重氢混合剂工作的反应堆，看来其活性区的最小尺寸大约为一米，用纯重氢工作的反应堆则较大。显然，纯重氢热核反应堆仅仅对固定式的大功率电站是适用的。
    热核反应堆可用作为生产蒸气的一个热源，经过蒸气透平，使发电机发出电能，也有可能直接从反应堆中取到电能。
    热核反应堆可用作为生产蒸汽的一个热源，这种蒸汽在一般回路中经过蒸汽透平，使发电机发出电能，但是也有可能直接从反应堆中取到电能，而不必经过有效作用系数小的中间热回路的过程。早在1954年，苏联科学院原子能研究所就注意到这一点，由布德开尔
  （Г·И·БУДКЕР）详尽研究出来的方案就是其中的一个。这种可能性的理论基础是：在重氢等离子气体中三分之二以上的能量都是以带电粒子动能的形式放出来的。带电粒子是受磁场的控制的，所以，不难看到，用直接的方法有可能使粒子的动能转化为电能。例如脉动电流可以用下列方法取得。假定等离子气体受外加的磁场所控制，这外加磁场是由整个热核发生器的外壳中的电流所造成。假如把磁场少许加大，那末等离子气体更加压缩，而它的温度和密度也相继增加。由此，热核反应进行得就更快，而等离子气体加热就更大。等离子气体开始扩大，因而导致冷却，并从反应堆体积内将磁场拉出往外。磁力线穿过外壳，结果在外壳中产生电流。在一定的工作状况下，这种电流的能量将大于用来压缩等离子气体所损耗掉的能量。
    可控制热核反应堆的建造工作在苏联、英国和美国差不多都是同时开始的。
    1950年，А·Д·沙哈罗夫院士和И·Б·达姆院士提出了磁热核反应堆的第一个模型，奠定了苏联在这方面研究的基础。此后，我们在这方面又分成了许多方向来进行研究，目前，有科学家和工程师组成的几个集体在从事此项工作。1956年所发表的工作是在苏联科学院原子能研究所内由Л·А·阿尔齐莫维奇院士和М·А·列昂托维奇院士领导，А·М·安特里阿诺夫，О·И·巴齐列夫斯卞娃，С·И·白拉金斯基，И·Н·哥罗芬?依，С·Ю·鲁基扬诺夫，С·М·奥沙维茨，И·М·波特高尔尼，В·И·辛尼钦?依，Н·В·费林伯维依，Н·А·雅夫林斯基和其他研究人员在某一研究方向上所完成的，在这些工作里，稀薄的重氢在所谓快速过程里用两百万安培的电流加热到一百万度以上。这时观察到了中子的发射。
    最近半年来英国原子能委员会曾定期报道说，在哈威尔原子能研究所的实验性热核装置“ＺＥＴＡ”（即“零功率热核反应装置”）的安装工作已告结束并已运转。
    在今年1月24日的“自然”杂志上发表了一篇有关“ＺＥＴＡ”装置的说明和在此装置上所进行的一些实验的结果。
    “ＺＥＴＡ”装置是用来研究用磁场来保持游离氢的条件，这磁场是由氢气中流过的电流产生的，以及研究如何获得足够在重氢中产生原子核反应所需的高温。
    “ＺＥＴＡ”是一个用直径为一公尺的铝管制成的密封室，管成环状，其平均直径为三公尺。室内装有重氢，压力由百万到几千万分之一个大气压。气体中有电流，其强度为二十万安培。电流使气体变热，电流的磁场不让气体扩张和气体与室的金属壁挨近。
    “ＺＥＴＡ”装置是在知名的英国物理学家约翰·考克洛夫特领导下，由哈威尔原子能研究所的P·汤尼曼，D·弗莱，W·汤姆逊和一些科学研究人员共同制造的。该装置是由“密特洛坡里坦·维克斯”电器公司设计。英国物理学家认为，他们已成功地把重氢加热到五百万度以上并能使重氢不挨近壁达几千分之一秒之久。在这一时间内曾经观察到中子辐射。“ＺＥＴＡ”是一个设计得很好的实验性装置。英国物理学家在这上面做了一系列实验，但所得到的结果还不足以说明关于在室中所发生的现象的清楚图画。英国的另一类似装置是在阿里滂博士的领导下，由奥尔得马斯顿的物理学家们建造的。在文章中报道说，在此装置上他们已得到了四百万度以上的高温。
    在建造“ＺＥＴＡ”时，科学家们并未打算从热核反应中取到能量。在装置上进行实验时，放出的能量要比用于维持工作状况所损耗掉的能量小万亿倍。
    苏联青年理论学家沙夫朗诺夫曾经作出了研究稳定性的全部理论。苏联将在今年召开的第二届国际和平利用原子能会议上介绍研究工作的情形。
    各国的物理学家和工程师们还得下很大功夫，首先要弄清楚工业利用热核能的途径。
    在“ＺＥＴＡ”中，有电流通过的放电柱是由绕在室上的线圈所产生的弱的外磁场的作用而被保持在稳定状态中。1953年苏联青年理论学家沙夫朗诺夫就曾经作出了类似在“ＺＥＴＡ”上的放电柱的稳定性的全部理论。
    在我国也正在对环形室中的放电进行研究，但与英国人的方案有所不同。我们想在今年即将在日内瓦召开的第二届国际和平利用原子能会议上将此项工作介绍出来。
    发表在同一期“自然”杂志上的美国文章，并没有描写出什么原则上新的事实。美国物理学家在大功率脉冲放电中观察到了中子辐射，但文章中所说的辐射强度要比苏联科学院原子能研究所物理学家们所观察到的强度小得多。
    杂志上所发表的文章与美国在这方面工作的规模是不相称的。美国现在起码有五个巨大的科学中心在专门研究可控制热核反应方面的问题，将近有五百名学者参与了此项工作，其中包括美国的大物理学家、氢弹制造者E·泰勒尔。直至目前，各国在可控制热核反应方面所进行的工作极大部分仍然是保密的。热核反应堆不仅可以用于和平目的，同样也可以用于战争目的，因为借助于热核反应堆可以得到制造原子弹用的可分裂铀和钚。在没有禁止使用原子武器和氢武器之前，很难期望从事可控制热核反应研究的各国科学家之间能达到开诚布公的地步。
