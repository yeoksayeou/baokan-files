Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Since the beginning of this year, China's iron and steel industry has seen unprecedented high production records and large-scale bumper harvests in every production link. In the Great Leap Forward, iron and steel workers have achieved several major technological innovations and creations, making China's iron and steel industry lead the world in the same industry in several major economic and technical indicators.

According to statistics from January to June, the output of major products has exceeded the increase production and practice economy plans proposed by the employees. Pig iron output exceeded the increase production and practice economy plan by 360,000 tons, steel by 70,000 tons, and steel products by 150,000 tons, representing increases of 25% to 32% compared with the same period last year. Several important steel products that China has traditionally lacked, such as heavy steel rails, silicon steel sheets, medium and thick plates, thin plates, seamed pipes, and seamless pipes, have also increased by 26% to 142% compared with the same period last year. More than 200 important new products, such as composite steel plates, high-strength structural steel, and copper-silicon steel rails, have been successfully trial-produced.

In terms of several major economic and technical indicators, China is now leading the world in the same industry. The average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces nationwide in the first half of the year has improved from 0.757 last year to 0.697, and the average utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces has increased from 7.21 last year to 7.54. Advanced blast furnaces such as No. 1 blast furnace of Benxi Iron and Steel Plant with a monthly average utilization coefficient of 0.525, and advanced open-hearth furnaces such as Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant with a monthly average utilization coefficient of 12.116, are even rarer excellent records in the world.

Equally excellent records have appeared in every production link of the iron and steel industry. In the first half of the year, some advanced factories and mines created records in mining footage, mineral processing magnetic recovery rate, coke ash content, and refractory material firing time, which were not recorded in books and literature. The unprecedented bumper harvest of China's iron and steel industry in the first half of this year is primarily due to the nationwide upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running the iron and steel industry, inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, more than 11,000 native and foreign small blast furnaces have been built across the country.

The breaking of superstitions and dogmatism by the vast number of employees of iron and steel enterprises during the rectification movement is also an important factor in the rapid development of the iron and steel industry in the first half of the year. For example, the employees of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's concentrator broke the old theory that "improving the concentrate grade and improving the ore recovery rate are contradictory" and improved both at the same time.

Another reason for the comprehensive bumper harvest of the iron and steel industry in the first half of this year is that the vast number of iron and steel employees have launched a vigorous technical revolution movement. In March of this year, the open-hearth furnace of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant pioneered the three-tap steelmaking method, sounding the号角 (horn) of the technical revolution in the iron and steel industry. At present, most of the open-hearth furnaces in the country have adopted multi-tap steelmaking. This groundbreaking innovation not only liberated the production capacity of open-hearth furnaces, but also greatly saved on the crane equipment and plant structure of newly built open-hearth furnaces in the future. It is estimated that investment can be saved by 15% to 20%. The three-row tuyeres of the steelmaking converter created by Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant have shown that the smelting time is shortened by 20%, the blowing loss rate is reduced by 2% to 3%, and the output is increased by at least 14% compared with the single-row tuyeres. This is also a creation of the Chinese working class.

The major innovations in production and technology made by China's iron and steel industry in the first half of this year will reap even richer harvests in the second half of the year. (Attached pictures)

    全民办钢铁  处处报丰收
    几项经济技术指标走在世界同业前列
    全国新建一万一千多座土洋小高炉
    据新华社7日讯  今年以来，我国钢铁工业在每一个生产环节上都出现了史无前例的高产量纪录和大面积丰收。钢铁工人在大跃进中实现了几项重大的技术革新和创造，使得我国钢铁工业在几项主要的经济技术指标方面，走在世界同业的前列。
    根据1—6月的统计，主要产品的产量已经超过了职工们提出的增产节约计划，生铁比增产节约计划多产三十六万吨，钢多产七万吨，钢材多产十五万吨，比去年同期的产量分别增长了25％—32％。我国一向比较缺少的几种重要钢材如重型钢轨、矽钢片、中厚板、薄板、有缝管、无缝管等，也比去年同期增长了26％—142％，并且试制成功了复合钢板、高强度结构钢、含铜含矽钢轨等二百多种重要的新产品。
    在几项主要的经济技术指标方面，现在我国走在世界同业的前列。全国高炉的平均利用系数上半年已从去年的○·七五七改善到○·六九七，平炉的平均利用系数已经从去年的七·二一提高为七·五四；先进高炉如本溪一厂一号高炉的月平均利用系数○·五二五，先进平炉如上钢三厂的月平均利用系数一二·一一六，更是世界少见的优异纪录。
    同样优异的纪录，在钢铁工业的各个生产环节上都有出现。上半年一些先进厂矿在采矿掘进公尺、选矿磁收率、炼焦灰份以及耐火材料烧成时间等方面所创造的纪录，都是书本和文献上没有记载过的。我国钢铁工业今年上半年获得空前的丰收，首先是因为在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，全国范围内掀起了一个全党全民办钢铁工业的高潮。据不完全的统计，全国已经办起了一万一千多座土、洋小高炉。
    钢铁企业广大职工在整风运动中，破除了迷信和教条主义的束缚，也是上半年钢铁工业飞跃发展的一个重要因素。如本溪钢铁公司选矿厂的职工，打破了历来认为“提高精矿品位和提高矿石回收率互相矛盾”的陈旧理论，把两者同时提高了。
    今年上半年钢铁工业全面丰收的另一原因是，广大的钢铁职工已经展开了蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命运动。今年3月，太原钢铁厂平炉首创三槽出钢，吹响了钢铁工业技术革命的号角，目前全国绝大部分平炉，都已经采取多槽出钢。这个具有重大革命意义的创举，不仅解放了平炉的生产能力，而且从此以后新建平炉的吊车设备和厂房结构可以大大节约，初步估计能节约投资15％—20％。上海钢铁公司三厂创造的炼钢转炉三排风眼，初步的效果比单排风眼的冶炼时间缩短20％，吹损率下降2％—3％，产量至少提高14％。这也是我国工人阶级的创造。
    今年上半年我国钢铁工业在生产和技术上的各项重大创造，将在下半年得到更为丰硕的收获。（附图片）
