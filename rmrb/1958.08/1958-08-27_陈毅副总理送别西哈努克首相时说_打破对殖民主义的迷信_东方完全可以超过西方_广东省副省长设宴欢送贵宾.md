Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 26th: This evening, Wei Jinfei, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, held a banquet to bid farewell to Premier Sihanouk and all the distinguished guests of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, leaders of the Party, government, and military in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and heads of local organizations of various democratic parties attended the banquet. Yang An, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China, was also invited to attend.

Premier Sihanouk spoke at the banquet. He said: "China's reception of us has been so touching, and its friendship towards us is so sincere. On the eve of leaving China, I want to once again express my gratitude to your leaders and all the Chinese people. We will never forget the days we spent with you. These days mark the beginning of a new era in which our two countries, in the spirit of Bandung, cooperate to ensure the welfare of our two peoples and to maintain peace in Asia and the world.”

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke. He praised Premier Sihanouk's outstanding talent and his loyalty to the Cambodian people. Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Colonialists have consistently spread various slanders about Eastern countries, portraying the Eastern people as inferior races. They slander China's 'national character' as ignorance, backwardness, and laziness; falsely claim that China's population is too large, an unbearable pressure, and no government can solve the people's livelihood problems; they assert that China's science is backward, resources are scarce, and it can never be industrialized... The prejudices spread by colonialists against the Chinese people have even had a certain impact on some Chinese people, forming a sense of inferiority. I think this may be similar in our Asian and African countries. We believe that unless we directly break the colonialists' spiritual enslavement of us, we will not be able to stand up and we will not be able to establish the political confidence to defeat colonialism.” Vice Premier Chen Yi said, “Our China has provided new experience in dealing with this issue. The first is to break the superstition of colonialism and establish the confidence that the Chinese people dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Orientals are no worse than Westerners, not inherently backward. As long as we unite ourselves, pay attention to learning, pay attention to experimentation, and are not afraid of difficulties, we Chinese and Orientals can fully master modern science and technology and cultural knowledge, and can surpass Westerners in many fields.”

Vice Premier Chen Yi said with full confidence: “The 20th century is the century of Asian and African countries, the century of Latin America, and also the century of nationalism and socialism. We hail the great liberation of mankind from the imperialist colonial system, and the day when light will finally triumph over darkness has arrived!”

Vice Governor Wei Jinfei delivered a welcoming speech to the distinguished guests at the beginning of the banquet.

This afternoon, accompanied by Wei Jinfei, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, and Sun Leyi, Vice Mayor of Guangzhou, the distinguished guests visited the China Export Commodities Fair. After the visit, the Prime Minister wrote an inscription in the commemorative album. The Prime Minister praised the exhibition for its large number and diversity of exhibits, "proving that China is making continuous progress and that China will soon become a modern power."

Prince Sihanouk and his party arrived in Guangzhou this morning from Wuhan, accompanied by Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Peiwen, and others. Yang An, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China, arrived on the same flight.

　　陈毅副总理送别西哈努克首相时说
    打破对殖民主义的迷信  东方完全可以超过西方
    广东省副省长设宴欢送贵宾
    新华社广州26日电　今晚，广东省副省长魏今非举行宴会，欢送西哈努克首相和柬埔寨王国的全体贵宾们。陈毅副总理、外交部礼宾司司长俞沛文、广东省和广州市党、政、军领导人以及各民主党派地方组织的负责人等出席了宴会，柬埔寨驻中国经济代表团团长杨安也应邀出席。
    西哈努克首相在宴会上讲话。他说：“中国对我们的接待是如此动人，对我们的友谊是如此真诚，在离开中国的前夕，我要再一次向你们的领导人和全体中国人民表示感谢。我们将永远不会忘记同你们一起度过的日子。这些日子标志着我们两国为保证两国人民的福利、维护亚洲和世界和平而本着万隆精神进行合作的新纪元的开始。
    陈毅副总理接着讲话。他赞颂西哈努克首相的卓越才干和他对于柬埔寨人民的忠诚。陈毅副总理说：“殖民主义者对于东方国家一贯散播种种谰言，把东方人民描绘成低等的民族。他们诬蔑中国的‘民族性’就是愚昧落后、懒惰；妄称中国人口过多，是不堪重负的压力，没有一个政府能够解决人民的生活问题，他们断言中国科学落后，资源缺乏，永远也不能工业化……。殖民主义者对于中国人民所散布的这些偏见甚至在一部分中国人中也产生了一定的影响，形成一种妄自菲薄的心理。我想这在我们亚非各国也可能有类似的情形。我们认为不正面击破殖民主义者对我们的这种精神奴役，我们自己便站不起来，便无法建立战胜殖民主义的政治信心。”陈毅副总理说：“我们中国处理这个问题，提供了新的经验，首先是打破对殖民主义的迷信，建立中国人民敢想敢说敢做的信心。东方人比西方人并不差，并不是天生的落后，只要我们自己团结，注意学习，注意试验，不怕困难，现代的科学技术、文化知识，我们中国人和东方人是可以完全掌握的，而且在许多领域可以超过西方人的。”
    陈毅副总理满怀信心地说：“二十世纪是亚非国家的世纪，是拉丁美洲的世纪，也是民族主义和社会主义的世纪。我们欢呼人类将要从帝国主义的殖民制度下大解放，光明最后战胜黑暗的日子已经到来！”
    魏今非副省长在宴会开始的时候曾致词欢迎贵宾。
    今天下午，贵宾在广东省副省长魏今非和广州市副市长孙乐宜等陪同下，参观了中国出口商品陈列馆。参观以后，首相在纪念册上题词留念。首相称赞展览会展品数量很多，而且多样化，“证明中国正在不断进步，中国很快就会变成现代化的大国”。
    西哈努克亲王一行今天上午由国务院副总理陈毅、外交部礼宾司司长俞沛文等陪同从武汉飞抵广州。柬埔寨王国驻中国经济代表团团长杨安同机到达。
