　　U.S. Labor Union Demands U.S. Troops Withdraw from the Middle East
　　Democratic Senator Morse Says the U.S. Should Not Invade Lebanon
    Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, New York Dispatch: According to the August 10th "Worker's Weekly," the Executive Committee of Local 6 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union passed a statement demanding that the United States immediately withdraw troops from the Middle East. The statement pointed out the dangerous nature of the situation in the Middle East and stated that the U.S. armed intervention in Lebanon has caused the U.S.'s reputation to be "completely ruined." In the hearts of most of the world's people, especially in the hearts of the Arab people, the U.S. is no longer a democratic nation.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Democratic Senator Morse on the 9th demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon.
    Morse, at a press conference held in Des Moines, Iowa, criticized the U.S. government's policy of armed intervention in Lebanon. He said, "We should never have gone into Lebanon, and now we should get out." He pointed out that one of the U.S. government's excuses for sending troops to Lebanon was to protect American citizens, but "Americans in the Middle East are not in danger," and even if the U.S. president had the right to protect citizens, he had no right to "occupy (another country's) territory." Morse also said that the U.S. "cannot suppress Arab nationalism by force, even if it stations troops there (in the Middle East) for fifty years."

　　美工会组织要求美军撤出中东
　　民主党参议员莫尔斯说美国不应侵入黎巴嫩
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：据8月10日的“工人周报”报道，美国国际码头与仓库工人工会第六分会执行委员会通过一项声明，要求美国立即从中东撤退军队。声明指出了中东局势的危险性，并且指出美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动已经使美国的名声“一败涂地”，在世界大多数人民的心目中，特别在阿拉伯人民的心目中，美国已不复成为民主国家。
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国民主党参议员莫尔斯9日要求美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    莫尔斯在衣阿华州得梅因举行记者招待会时抨击美国政府武装干涉黎巴嫩的政策。他说，“我们绝不应当进入黎巴嫩，现在我们应当撤出来。”他指出，美国政府出兵黎巴嫩的一个借口是保护美国侨民，但是“在中东的美国人并没有危险”，而且美国总统即使有权保护侨民，他却无权“占领（别国）领土”。莫尔斯还说，美国是“不能够用武力把阿拉伯民族主义镇压下来的，即使在那里（中东）驻兵五十年”。
