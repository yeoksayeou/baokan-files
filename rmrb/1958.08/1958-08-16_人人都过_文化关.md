　　Everyone Passes the "Culture Barrier"
　　When I went to Pan'an Town in Gangu, Gansu, passing by Liujiadun, I saw from afar in the middle of the road a green archway made of leaves. Several children were jumping around it, holding slogans written on red and green paper. It looked like they were welcoming our most beloved people returning, or maybe the village was holding some kind of celebration. But as I got closer, I saw that the archway was written with three big red characters: "Culture Barrier." Guarding the barrier was a group of adorable elementary school students. As soon as they saw me coming, they laughed and jumped and surrounded me. A little girl, about eight years old, wearing a red scarf and with two small braids, said to me with a smile, "Uncle, people passing the barrier need to be able to read!" As she spoke, she asked me to read the slogan in her small hand. I read aloud: "Socialism is paradise, without culture you can't go there." After I finished reading, they all laughed and said, "Uncle is good! You need to read some more to pass the barrier." Then, I read all the slogans they were holding: "The land is paper, the hand is a pen, study hard and practice diligently, be both red and expert," "If commune members have culture, their production enthusiasm is high; don't forget to study during production, and studying doesn't delay production"... Before I finished reading, the children jumped and shouted: "Good, good, uncle, that means you can pass the barrier!" Just then, an old man came over with a basket of eggs, and everyone surrounded him again and said, "Old grandpa, the teacher said, you have to be able to read before you can pass the barrier!" A child reached into his pocket and took out a character card to ask the old man to recognize. The old man looked at it and said with a smile, "Isn't this the 'worker's' 工 character? I already learned it in night school." The children clamored, "Old grandpa is so good!" The old man, praised by the children, smiled proudly and said, "Without culture, how can we reach socialism?" Then he recognized several more characters. Finally, the children helped him read, write, and remember the meaning of five unfamiliar characters before letting him pass the barrier. I passed the "barrier" with this old man who couldn't stop smiling, and walked away beaming.

　　人人都过“文化关”
    我到甘肃甘谷盘安镇去，路过刘家墩的时候，远远望见在大路的中间，有一座绿色的用树叶扎成的彩门，跟前几个孩子们在跳跃着，手里还拿些红绿纸写成的标语。看样子就像是欢迎我们最可爱的人归来，再不就是村里在开什么庆祝会。谁知走近一看，彩门上却写着“文化关”三个大红字，把关的是一群可爱的小学生，一看见我过来，就笑着跳着围到我跟前。一个八岁左右的小姑娘，带着红领巾，梳着两个小辫子，笑嘻嘻的向我说：“叔叔，过关的人要认字呢！”说着就把她小手里拿的标语叫我认。我念着说：“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”。念完，他们一齐笑着说：“叔叔好，还要再认一些，才叫你过关”。接着，我就把他们手里拿的标语全念出来：“地是纸，手是笔，勤学苦炼，又红又专”“社员有文化，生产劲头大，生产不忘学习，学习不误生产”……还没念完，孩子们就连蹦带跳的说：
  “好哪，好哪，叔叔这就算能过关啦”。正说着，一位老大爷提着一篮鸡蛋过来，大家又围上去说：“老大爷，老师说的，先要认字，才能过关哪！”说着一个小朋友顺手从口袋里摸出一个字块来叫老大爷认，老大爷一看笑着说：“这不就是个工人的‘工’字吗？我在夜校里早就认过的”。孩子们就哄嚷着说：“老大爷真好！”老头儿受到孩子们的表扬，得意地笑着说：“没有文化，怎么到社会主义哪？”接着一连又认了几个，最后，孩子们把五个不认得的生字帮他念会，写会，记住意思，这才放他过关。我就和这位乐得合不上口的老大爷一起过了“关”，笑咪咪的走了。
