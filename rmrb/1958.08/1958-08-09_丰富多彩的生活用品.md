　　Market Scene is New Every Day

　　Colorful Daily Necessities

　　More than a thousand new daily necessities have recently appeared on the Beijing market. These new products are produced in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang and other places.

　　Among the new commodities are many plastic products. Such as transparent plastic cloth, which can be used to make raincoats, aprons, sleeves, bibs, etc. The plastic travel cup is shaped like a small round box, and when lifted upwards, it becomes a light and portable teacup. The PVC suitcases and handbags look like artificial leather on the surface, come in more than twenty colors, and are both lightweight and beautiful. PVC bowls, soap boxes, buttons and fragrant hair clips are heat-resistant, sturdy and practical.

　　New varieties of textiles include wide-faced floral cloth for making clothing for both autumn and summer, which are very popular among young women. There are also fragrant fabrics that can be used to make summer clothing. Feili silk and artificial wool and tussah silk interwoven satin looks very much like woolen worsted, and is very suitable for making suits and skirts.

　　There are also fine cashmere sweaters with various fragrances such as rose and sandalwood, and nylon gloves in various sizes, which are all loved by customers.

　　Among the daily necessities is an air carbide lamp that does not require electric wires. It contains dry batteries and can burn for six hundred hours. It is brighter than a kerosene lamp and cheaper than burning a kerosene lamp. The eight-pound triangular thermos can be used to keep warm and cold, and can also be used to make porridge.

    丰富多彩的生活用品
    北京市场上最近出现了一千多种新的生活日用品。这些新产品是北京、上海、天津、沈阳等地生产的。
    新商品中有许多塑料制品。如塑料透明布，可以做雨衣、围裙、套袖、围嘴等。塑料旅行杯，形状如一个小圆盒，向上一提就成为一个轻巧的茶杯。聚氯乙烯制做的皮箱、手提包，从表面看来和人造革一样，颜色有二十多种，又轻便又漂亮。聚氯乙烯制做的饭碗、肥皂盒、钮扣和香味扑鼻的发卡等，具有不怕热、坚固适用的优点。
    纺织品中的新品种有秋夏两季用来做服装的宽面花布，很受姑娘们欢迎。还有带香味的布，可以做夏季服装。飞利绸和人造毛及柞丝交织绸缎，看来很似毛织的凡尔丁，很适合做西服和裙子。
    还有带有玫瑰、檀香各种香味的细羊毛衫，各种尺码的尼龙手套等，都为顾客所喜爱。
    日常用品中有一种空气电石灯，不用电线，里边装有干电池，可点六百个小时，它比煤油灯亮，比点煤油灯价钱便宜。八磅三角暖水瓶除了保暖保冷外，还可用来做稀饭。
