Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th: At the self-reform experience exchange conference of industrial and commercial circles convened by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Rectification Work Committee, leading members of these two organizations from various regions reported on and enthusiastically discussed the changes in the political outlook of industrialists and merchants after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle. They recognized that industrialists and merchants had gained a great deal in this political and ideological socialist revolution, but their duality still exists and needs to be continuously reformed in various labor practices. Representatives from various regions also signed an agreement at the meeting, deciding to launch a competition throughout the national industrial and commercial circles to accelerate self-reform.

　　During the meeting, Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a cordial speech to the more than 300 representatives attending the meeting. He spoke about the exciting situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind in the international arena and the great leap forward in domestic construction. Taking the situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai as an example, he explained that in recent years, especially after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, industrialists and merchants have made considerable progress, but the development of each individual is uneven. He cited many vivid examples to encourage industrialists and merchants to continue to advance on the road of self-reform and keep up with the rapidly developing new situation. He said that in the process of transformation, industrialists and merchants only lose some dirty and ugly things, and what they gain will be a bright and splendid future as self-reliant laborers.

　　The meeting was conducted in the form of full airing of views, great debate. The representatives raised many specific issues for discussion, and established many opposing viewpoints for debate. Among them, the more focused discussion was on how to recognize the current duality of industrialists and merchants. Some people believed to varying degrees that after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the problem of the two roads of the majority of industrialists and merchants has been basically resolved, and the duality should also be said to have basically disappeared. However, based on many facts and after repeated debates, everyone unanimously recognized that the duality of industrialists and merchants still exists, manifested in fundamental issues such as the attitude towards accepting the leadership of the Party, accepting socialist transformation, and participating in socialist construction. In addition to the active and good side, industrialists and merchants also have a passive and bad side.

　　After the representatives attending the meeting reached a unified understanding on several issues, they felt that in order to promote the active side of industrialists and merchants and overcome the passive side, the current self-reform of industrialists and merchants needs to solve four problems. First, they must be loyal and honest to the Party. They believe that only by being loyal and honest to the Party can industrialists and merchants receive the Party's help and achieve complete transformation. However, at present, many people are still half-hearted to varying degrees towards the Party. They often complain about not being trusted by the Party, but in fact they do not trust the Party. Second, it is necessary to clarify the so-called view that self-reform is too tense. They believe that many industrialists and merchants currently want to take a break from self-reform and take it slowly, which is essentially a manifestation of weariness with continuing self-reform. Failure to eliminate this concept will become a serious obstacle to continued transformation. Third, learn from the working people, accept the supervision and education of the working people. At present, many industrialists and merchants are still not convinced of learning from the working people, or they are convinced in words but not in their hearts; some people only abstractly admit that they should learn from the working class, but do not sincerely learn from the employees of their own factories and shops, or they only admit learning from workers but are unwilling to learn from peasants. They believe that this is a key to whether industrialists and merchants can completely transform themselves, and it is necessary to thoroughly recognize its significance through repeated self-ideological struggle and implement it in practice. Fourth, while continuing to transform the bourgeois political stance, it is necessary to oppose and overcome bourgeois individualism, because for bourgeois elements, individualism directly affects and even dominates their political stance. At the meeting, the representatives selected personnel to form a special group to put forward preliminary views on the above four issues, which will be taken back by the representatives from various regions for in-depth discussion among local industrialists and merchants.

　　In order to accelerate the self-reform of industrialists and merchants and keep up with the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the representatives attending the meeting signed the National Industrial and Commercial Circles Resolution to Implement the Socialist General Line and Accelerate Self-Reform Competition Agreement, deciding to carry out, inspect, and revise personal self-reform plans, and to carry out competition between individuals, enterprises, industries, and regions in the industrial and commercial circles.

　　This meeting was held in Shanghai from July 22nd to August 16th.

　　全国工商界自我改造经验汇报会议签订竞赛协议
　　掀起竞赛热潮加速自我改造
　　经过整风进步不少，但仍存在两面性，急需克服消极的一面，赶上大跃进形势
    据新华社上海17日电　在民建中央和全国工商联整风工作委员会召开的工商界自我改造经验汇报会议上，这两个组织的各地领导成员对工商业者在整风和反右派斗争以后政治面貌起了怎样变化的问题，作了情况汇报和热烈的讨论，认识到工商业者在这场政治上和思想上的社会主义革命中，得到了很大收获，但当前他们的两面性仍然存在，需要在各项劳动实践中继续改造自己。各地代表还在会上签订了协议书，决定在全国工商界展开一个加速自我改造的竞赛。
    会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施向出席会议的三百多个代表作了亲切的讲话。他谈了目前国际上东风压倒西风和国内各项建设大跃进的令人兴奋的形势，并且以上海工商界情况为例，说明几年来，特别是经过整风和反右派斗争，工商业者有了不少进步，但是各人的发展不平衡。他列举了很多生动的事例，鼓励工商业者在继续自我改造的道路上不断前进，跟上一日千里向前发展的新形势。他说，在改造中工商业者失掉的仅是一些肮脏、丑恶的东西，得到的将是作为一个自食其力劳动者的光辉灿烂的前途。
    会议是用大鸣大放、大争大辩的方式进行的。代表们提出讨论的具体问题很多，树立了不少争论的对立面。其中讨论比较集中的是怎样认识当前工商业者的两面性问题。有些人程度不同地认为，经过整风和反右派斗争，多数工商业者的两条道路问题已经基本解决，两面性也应该说已基本消失。但大家根据许多事实，经过反复辩论以后，一致地认识到工商业者的两面性目前仍然是存在的，表现在对待接受党的领导、接受社会主义改造和参加社会主义建设的态度等根本性的问题上，工商业者除了积极的、好的一面以外，都还有消极的、坏的一面。
    出席会议的代表对若干问题统一认识以后，感到为了发扬工商业者积极的一面，克服消极的一面，当前工商业者在自我改造中需要解决四个问题。第一，必须对党忠诚老实。他们认为，工商业者只有对党忠诚老实，才能得到党的帮助，使自己获得彻底改造。但是，目前还有不少人对党还是不同程度的半心半意。他们往往埋怨得不到党的信任，其实是他们不信任党。第二，需要澄清所谓自我改造太紧张的观点。他们认为目前不少工商业者对自我改造要求歇一歇，慢慢来，实质上是对继续自我改造的厌倦情绪的流露。这种观念不消除将成为继续改造中的严重障碍。第三，做到向劳动人民学习，接受劳动人民的监督和教育。目前不少工商业者对向劳动人民学习还是不服气，或者是口服心不服；有些人只是抽象地承认要向工人阶级学习，而不真心诚意地向本厂、本店职工学习，或者是只承认向工人学习，而不愿向农民学习。他们认为，这是工商业者能否彻底改造自己的一个关键，需要通过反复的自我思想斗争，彻底认识它的意义，并且在实际中去贯彻。第四，需要在当前继续改造资产阶级政治立场的同时，反对和克服资产阶级个人主义，因为对资产阶级分子来说，个人主义直接影响以至支配着他们的政治立场。会上，代表们选出人员组成专门小组，对上述四个问题提出初步的见解，将由各地代表带回去，在当地工商业者中进行深入讨论。
    为了加速工商业者的自我改造，跟上工农业生产大跃进的形势，到会代表签订了全国工商界坚决贯彻社会主义总路线加速自我改造竞赛协议书，决定通过执行、检查和修订个人自我改造规划，在工商界开展个人之间以及企业、行业和地区间的竞赛。
    这次会议是在7月22日到8月16日在上海举行的。
