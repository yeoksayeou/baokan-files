　　Seeking Teachers in the Countryside
    Jiangxi Agricultural College Teachers and Students Reap a Bumper Harvest in Ideology and Professional Skills
    According to the Jiangxi Daily: Teachers and students of the Agronomy Department of Jiangxi Agricultural College went out of the school and deep into the countryside. On the one hand, they helped farmers harvest early rice, and on the other hand, they exchanged and summarized the rich experience of this year's agricultural bumper harvest with farmers in high-yield areas, and gained huge gains in ideology and professional skills.
    Recently, the teachers and students of the Agronomy Department organized several groups to go to agricultural cooperatives in Pingxiang, Leping, Xingzi and other counties to work and visit. Most of these agricultural cooperatives have an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu for early rice this year, and many people have personally participated in the harvesting of high-yield fields with a yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu. Before going to the countryside, many of them did not believe that the yield per mu could reach such a high level, because they had not learned about it in the books they studied, and the professors also told them that the early rice fields in Jiangxi could not exceed 1,200 jin per mu, and the indicators of their own experimental fields were only so much. Today's reality has made them break the superstition of rice professors and the shackles of book dogma.
    In their contact with farmers, teachers and students learned that the most important point for the bumper harvest of early rice this year is that the Party has a firm grasp on agricultural work and the farmers listen to the Party very much. The Party organized old farmers to hold discussions, concentrated the reliable experience of farmers in production and promoted it. The farmers' implementation of the Party's instructions on agricultural production was very resolute, which gave the teachers and students a very big education. Professor Zhao Yizhao said: "I have learned from practice that the Party can lead scientific work and understand the direction of scientific research work. The Party follows the mass line and sums up the good experience of the farmers. The effect is not comparable to what a few of us can achieve by working alone in the laboratory. This year, our early rice experimental fields have a maximum yield of only about 600 jin per mu, and the minimum is only 300 jin per mu. If we engaged in agricultural science want to make some achievements, we must combine with the farmers." After this trip to the countryside, many professors and lecturers believed that the farmers' bumper harvest pointed out a road for scientific research: foreign experts must be combined with local experts, and scientific research must be carried out in close connection with production.
    This time in the countryside, the teachers and students of the Agricultural College also gained greatly in their professional skills. The reality of agricultural production has raised many new questions for them, such as "how to sow and transplant early," "how is dense planting most suitable," "how to apply fertilizer reasonably," "soil improvement," "rational irrigation and drainage," and so on. They saw that in the high-yield fields in Pingxiang County, sowing and transplanting were done around the Spring Festival, while the school books said that the best time was April 1; the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers in the farmers' high-yield fields was 1.5:1:3, while they had always taught 2:1:2. They brought back many new questions to prepare for special research.

### 下乡寻师  江西农学院师生思想业务齐丰收

　　下乡寻师
    江西农学院师生思想业务齐丰收
    据江西日报报道：江西农学院农学系师生走出学校深入农村，一面帮助农民收割早稻，一面同丰产区农民一起交流、总结今年农业丰产的丰富经验，在思想上和业务上都得到了巨大的收获。
    农学系的师生们最近组织了几个组，分赴萍乡、乐平、星子等县的农业社进行劳动和访问。这些农业社大多数今年早稻每亩平均产量都在八百斤以上，许多人还亲自参加过亩产两千多斤以上高产田的收割。在去农村之前，他们中间很多人不相信亩产会达到这么高，因为他们学的书本上没有说过，教授还对他们说江西的早稻田每亩不能超过一千二百斤，他们自己种的试验田的指标也只有这么多。而今天的现实使他们打破对水稻教授的迷信和受书本教条的束缚。
    师生们和农民接触中，了解到今年早稻所以丰收，最重要的一点是党对农业工作抓得紧，农民十分听党的话。党组织了老农座谈，集中了农民生产中的可靠经验加以推广，农民们执行党对农业生产的指示非常坚决，这一点给师生们非常大的教育。赵以诏教授说：“我从实际中体会到党能够领导科学工作，并且懂得了科学研究工作的方向。党走群众路线，总结农民们的好经验，收到的效果不是我们少数人在实验室单干所能相比的。今年我们的早稻试验田亩产最多只六百来斤，少的仅仅三百来斤，我们搞农业科学的人，如果想做一点成绩，就一定要和农民结合。”这次下乡以后，许多教授和讲师们认为，农民们的丰产给他们指出了一条科学研究的道路：洋专家必须和土专家结合，必须密切联系生产开展科学研究。
    这次下乡，农学院师生们在业务上的收获也是重大的。农业生产的实际向他们提出了许多新问题，如“怎么早播早插”，“密植怎样最适宜”，“如何合理施肥”，“土壤改造”，“合理灌溉排水”等等。他们看到萍乡县丰产田，播插都在春节左右，而学校书本上说的最好是4月1日；农民丰产田氮磷钾肥料的比例是一点五比一比三，而他们一向教的是二比一比二。他们带回了许多新问题准备做专题研究。
