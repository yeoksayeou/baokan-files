Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 30th – A "Time" magazine article published on July 28 revealed that the United States had long drafted plans for launching a war of aggression in the Middle East.

The article said that before Eisenhower issued the order to invade Lebanon, Chief of Naval Operations Burke rushed to his office early in the morning. "At Burke's command, staff officers handed him briefcases and all documents, including the long-prepared and frequently reviewed operational plans for the Middle East. The key points of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's operational plan in Lebanon were: (1) to deploy 5,000 Marines from the Sixth Fleet to Lebanon within a few hours; (2) to transport 25,000 troops of various services to the Middle East within a week. The key to the Lebanon plan was the Sixth Fleet, which had been patrolling the Lebanese coast for three months and the Mediterranean for eight years, precisely for this type of emergency."

The article said, "Before reporting to the National Security Council meeting to the President, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining spent only ninety minutes with his generals to revise the original Lebanon operational plan to adapt it to the current situation. A National Security Council observer said, 'Twining knew exactly what should be done and what he could do.'"

    “时代周刊”透露
    美侵略中东经过长期准备
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：7月28日出版的“时代周刊”刊载一篇文章，透露美国早就拟订了在中东发动侵略战争的计划。
    文章说，在艾森豪威尔发出侵略黎巴嫩的命令以前，海军参谋长伯克一早就匆匆到了他的办公室。“在伯克的命令下，参谋军官向他递交了公事皮包和全部文件，这里面包括有经过长期准备和经常检查的对中东的作战计划。参谋长联席会议的在黎巴嫩的作战计划要点是：（一）在几小时内把第六舰队的五千名海军陆战队投入黎巴嫩；（二）在一周内把各兵种的二万五千名军队运往中东。黎巴嫩计划的关键在于第六舰队，这支舰队在黎巴嫩沿海巡逻了三个月，在地中海巡逻了八年，正是为了这类紧急情况。”
    文章说，“参谋长联席会议主席特文宁在到国家安全委员会会议上向总统报告以前，只用了九十分钟同他的将领们校正了原来的黎巴嫩作战计划，使它适应当时的情况。国家安全委员会一个观察员说，‘特文宁确切地知道应该做什么，以及他可以做什么。’”
