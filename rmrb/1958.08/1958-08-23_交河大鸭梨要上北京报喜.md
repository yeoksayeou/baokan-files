　　Jiaoge Big Pear to Report Good News to Beijing

　　Many people in the North know that the big pears of Jiaoge County, Hebei Province, are large, thin-skinned, juicy, fragrant, sweet, and crisp. After eight months of hard work in pruning, scraping bark, applying top dressing, irrigating, and eliminating pests, the fruit farmers achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. It is estimated that the yield per mu will be 2,800 jin, and the total income will increase several times compared to the yield in 1957. More than 500,000 jin of pears have already been harvested and transported to Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to supply urban residents.

　　Under the brilliant light of the General Line, Jiaoge fruit farmers have liberated their minds, established the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to create boldly, thus resulting in a large number of high-yield and high-income areas, with an average yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu on 333 mu. In addition, 2,462 trees yielding over 1,000 jin and 2,000 jin each have been cultivated, and thousands of "character pears" (pears with characters appearing on them) and "strange pears" (pears grown into strange shapes through human processing) have been made, ready to report good news to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At present, all fruit farmers are strengthening the late-stage management of fruit trees to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest.

　　交河大鸭梨要上北京报喜
    北方好多人都知道，河北交河县的大鸭梨个大、皮薄、汁多、味香、甜脆适口。果农们整枝、刮皮、追肥、灌水、消灭虫害经过八个月的苦战，获得了历史上未有过的空前大丰收。预计亩产二千八百斤，总收入比1957年产量增加几倍。现已落梨五十余万斤，外运到天津、北京、上海等地，供应城市人民。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，交河果农解放了思想，树立了敢想敢说敢干大胆创造的精神，因而出现了不少大面积高额丰产，平均亩产万斤以上的有三百三十三亩。另外培养了千斤和双千斤棵二千四百六十二株，还做了字梨（梨上现出文字）和奇梨（按照人的加工，结成奇异形状）数千个，准备给中央和毛主席报喜。目前全体果农正在加强果树后期管理，确保全面大丰收。
