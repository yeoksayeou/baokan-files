Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: According to TASS, Berlin, August 28th: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on August 28th regarding the results of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session.

The statement believes that the Arab countries' proposal adopted by the meeting (which requires US and British troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan) is a victory for the people of Arab countries and the entire peace force, and a moral and political failure for the aggressors.

The statement pointed out that the aggressive forces, disregarding the positive results achieved by the United Nations General Assembly meeting in easing the tense situation in the Middle East, still do not want to give up the positions seized through blatant aggression. Therefore, the people of all countries must work hard to make the aggressive troops withdraw from the Middle East quickly, and must expose all tricks to obstruct the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly meeting.

The statement pointed out that the results of the meeting have particularly important significance for the German people. West Germany being used by imperialism as a springboard for aggression in the Middle East and the West German ruling group's participation in the preparations for this aggression have made West German residents once again see the dangers brought about by the Adenauer government's implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policies. The statement said that the task of all peace-loving Germans is to make West Germany dismantle all bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in West Germany) and safeguard the peaceful interests of the German people.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 28th: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David gave an interview to a reporter from this news agency on some issues related to the results of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session. David said that the unanimous adoption of the joint proposal of the Arab countries at this meeting was an important step forward in easing the tense situation in the Near and Middle East. However, the danger of military conflict in the Near and Middle East region cannot be said to have passed as long as the troops of the United States and Britain do not withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. David said that therefore, all peace-loving people and all peace forces should supervise the implementation of the UN resolution and make the US and British intervention troops withdraw from the above-mentioned two countries as soon as possible.

David said that the characteristic of the recently concluded UN Emergency Special Session was that the delegations of most countries condemned the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East. The attempts of the US and British interventionists to replace their troops with the armed forces of the United Nations, to justify their intervention with the so-called "indirect aggression" slander, and to divert the meeting's attention from the main issue (the issue of the immediate withdrawal of intervention troops) by discussing other issues have all failed. In addition, the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" was also condemned at the meeting.

　　联大决议是和平力量的胜利
    民主德国政府强调迫令美英侵略军撤出中东
    捷外长说一切和平力量必须监督决议的执行
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社柏林28日讯：德意志民主共和国政府28日就联合国大会紧急特别会议的结果发表声明。
    声明认为，会议所通过的阿拉伯国家提案（其中要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦）是阿拉伯各国人民和整个和平力量的胜利，是侵略者在道义上、政治上的失败。
    声明指出，侵略势力不顾联合国大会会议取得的促使中东紧张局势缓和的良好结果，仍然不想放弃用公然侵略的办法夺取的阵地。因此，各国人民必须努力使侵略军迅速撤出中东，必须揭穿阴谋阻挠实现联合国大会会议决议的一切把戏。
    声明指出，会议的结果对德国人民有着特别重大的意义。西德被帝国主义利用为侵略中东的跳板以及西德统治集团参加这一侵略的准备工作，这都使西德居民又一次看清阿登纳政府执行北大西洋集团政策所带来的危险。声明说，一切爱好和平的德国人的任务是使西德撤除北大西洋集团（在西德）的一切基地和维护德国人民的和平利益。
    新华社布拉格28日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维就有关联合国大会紧急特别会议结果的一些问题，向这家通讯社记者发表了谈话。戴维说，这次会议一致通过了阿拉伯国家的联合提案，这就在缓和中近东紧张局势的道路上迈进了重要的一步。但是，美英两国的军队一天不撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，就不能说中近东地区的军事冲突的危险已经过去了。戴维说，因此，一切爱好和平的人民，一切和平力量应当监督联大决议的执行，要使美英干涉军尽快地撤出上述两个国家。
    戴维说，最近闭幕的联大紧急特别会议的特点是，大多数国家的代表团在会上都谴责美英两国对中近东的武装干涉。美英干涉者想用联合国的武装部队来代替它们的军队的企图、用所谓“间接侵略”的谰言来为他们的干涉进行辩护和用讨论其他问题的办法来转移会议对于主要问题（干涉军立即撤退的问题）的注意的企图都失败了。此外，“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”在会上也遭到了谴责。
