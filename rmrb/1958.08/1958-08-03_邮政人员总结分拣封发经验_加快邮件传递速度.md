Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd – National postal workers will use soaring revolutionary zeal to accelerate the speed of mail delivery and reduce intermediate transshipment layers to meet the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The National Postal Sorting and Dispatching Work On-Site Conference, which closed on July 31, passed a resolution in this regard.

In order to change the situation of mail being transshipped layer by layer, the Postal Department's Postal Bureau held a meeting in April with representatives from eleven provincial and municipal postal bureaus, proposing to postal workers nationwide a reform of letter sorting and dispatching work with the slogan "Sort to the end twice, sort on the train, cut time in half, eliminate errors completely." Starting from June 1, a new system of sorting letters on trains was tested on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line. According to the feedback from these eleven provinces and cities, since the implementation of the new mail sorting and dispatching reform system, many post and telecommunications bureaus have increased the number of directly dispatched bureaus. For example, the Beijing Bureau has increased the number by "one thousand five hundred and thirty-three." It is estimated that on average, 20%-30% of the letters now have their delivery speed increased by six to twenty-four hours every day; 30% of the letters have gotten rid of the phenomenon of repeated transshipment.

This on-site conference, attended by more than one hundred representatives from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, summarized and exchanged the experiences since the trial implementation of the new letter sorting and dispatching system, believing that this new system is correct, and decided to implement it in all postal units and railway mail cars with the conditions throughout the country, requiring "Comprehensive action in August, blossoming everywhere in September, and presenting a gift for the ‘Eleventh’ National Day."

According to statistics, an average of about four million pieces of mail circulate domestically every day, and they are related to millions of units, families, and individuals. Therefore, the meeting pointed out that whether postal workers hold it in their hands or carry it on their backs, it has a strong political significance. The quality of postal work is related to socialist construction and everyone's life.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd – Li Rong, a female letter sorter under the age of eighteen, innovated the outdated operating methods, sorting with her left hand and picking up letters with her right, and was able to separate more than 5,200 letters sent to different locations without errors every hour, setting the highest record for letter sorting speed in the country, twice as fast as the current domestic general speed.

    邮政人员总结分拣封发经验
    加快邮件传递速度
    据新华社济南2日电　全国邮政人员将以冲天的革命干劲，加快邮件的传递速度，减少中途经转层次，以适应工农业生产大跃进的需要。7月31日闭幕的全国邮政分拣封发工作现场会议通过了这方面的决议。
    为了改变邮件层层经转的情况，邮电部邮政总局曾在4月份召开有十一个省、市邮局的代表参加的会议，向全国邮政人员提出“两次分到底，车上也分拣，时间砍一半，差错消灭净”的革新函件分拣封发工作的倡议，并且从6月1日起在京沪铁路线上试行在火车上分拣信件的新制度。根据这十一个省、市的反映，自试行邮件分拣封发革新制度以来，很多邮电局增加了直接寄发局的数目，如北京局就增加了“一千五百三十三个。估计目前全面平均每天有20％—30％的函件，传递速度加快了六小时到二十四小时；30％的函件摆脱了重复经转现象。
    这次有全国各省、市、自治区一百多名代表参加的现场会议，总结和交流了试行新的函件分拣封发制度以来的经验，认为这一新的制度是正确的，并决定在全国所有有条件的邮政单位、铁路邮车施行，要求“8月全面动手，9月遍地开花，‘十一’国庆献礼”。
    据统计，目前平均每天约有四百万件邮件在国内流转，要与几百万个单位、家庭及个人发生关系。因此会议指出，邮政工作人员无论手里拿的，身上背的，都带有浓厚的政治意义，邮政工作做的好坏，关系到社会主义建设和每个人的生活。
    据新华社济南2日电　不满十八岁的女信件分拣员李荣，革新陈旧的操作方法，左手分拣，右手拿信，每小时能把五千二百多封寄往不同地点的信件不出差错地分开，创全国信件分拣速度的最高纪录，比目前国内的一般速度快一倍。
