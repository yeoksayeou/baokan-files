Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line for building socialism, the people of the entire nation unleashed soaring revolutionary fervor in the first half of this year, resulting in leaps and bounds in industrial and agricultural production and construction, accelerating at an even higher pace each month. The summer grain harvest has already achieved an unprecedented bumper yield, and combined with the early rice harvest, it is estimated that this year’s production can increase by over 80 billion jin. While thousands of large and medium-sized construction projects are progressing at an accelerated pace, over three million industrial units run by agricultural cooperatives and over 300,000 industrial enterprises run by townships, counties, special districts, provinces, and cities have emerged. Tens of thousands of new industrial products have been developed, and a mass technical innovation movement is surging forward, constantly producing new world-class production technology records. The market is active, and commodity inventories are abundant.

The following are figures provided by the State Statistical Bureau regarding the implementation of the national economic plan for the first half of 1958. These figures compose a magnificent picture of an unprecedented comprehensive Great Leap Forward in which all sectors of the national economy cooperate with and promote each other.

(1) Industrial Production

In the first half of this year, the total output value of national industry and handicrafts (excluding industry run by agricultural cooperatives) increased by 34% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the total output value of industry (excluding handicrafts) also increased by 34% compared to the same period last year, exceeding the growth rate of previous years (in the first half of 1956, which saw a surge, the growth rate was 26%), completing 58% of the original state annual plan.

Industrial production in the first half of the year leapt forward at an even higher speed each month. The growth rate of each month compared to the same month last year was, in order from January, 14%, 18%, 29%, 42%, 46%, and 55%.

After various localities implemented the policy of the entire Party and all the people running industry, local industry blossomed everywhere. In the first half of the year, the total number of new local industrial units at the provincial, special district, county, and township levels reached over 300,000, with a total output value of approximately 800 million yuan. Among these, provincial, special district, and county-level industrial enterprises numbered approximately 90,000, with an output value of approximately 700 million yuan, and township-run industrial enterprises numbered over 210,000, with an output value of approximately 100 million yuan. In addition, there were over three million industrial units run by agricultural cooperatives, with an output value of approximately 1.3 billion yuan. The large-scale entry of newly built industrial enterprises into production played a significant role in the high-speed development of national industry in the second quarter.

The vast majority of the newly built local industries directly serve agricultural production, such as the processing of fertilizers and feed, simple processing of agricultural products, and the repair and manufacture of agricultural tools. During this period, raw material, fuel, and power industries built by the masses using indigenous methods also increased. According to incomplete statistics, over 11,000 iron smelting furnaces have been built in the first half of the year, including over 900 small blast furnaces, over 20,000 small power stations, over 10,000 small cement kilns, and over 8,000 small coal kilns.

The output of the vast majority of industrial products in the first half of the year increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Among the 35 major products, electricity production increased by 30%; raw coal by 46%; crude oil by 32%; pig iron by 33%; steel by 26%; nitrogen fertilizer by 65%; machine tools by nearly 100%; and electric motors by more than 100%.

The technical innovation movement has been universally launched, and the number of new product trial production varieties has increased significantly compared to previous years. In the first half of the year, sixteen provinces and cities, including Liaoning and Shanghai, successfully trial-produced a total of 27,000 new products, which will have a significant impact on the development of the national economy.

By the end of June this year, the number of employees in national industrial enterprises had increased by 990,000 compared to the end of last year. In the first half of the year, the labor productivity of all industrial employees increased by approximately 24% compared to last year.

In the first half of the year, the cost of national key industrial enterprises decreased by 6.8% compared to last year. Among them, the cost of enterprises under the seven industrial ministries of the Central Government—Coal, Electricity, Petroleum, Metallurgy, Chemical Industry, First Machine Building, and Construction Engineering (formerly enterprises of the Ministry of Building Materials)—decreased by 7.6% compared to last year, exceeding the cost reduction target (5.9%) originally set by the state for the year. The cost of local key enterprises decreased by 5.5%.

In terms of working capital, the principle of increasing production without increasing investment or increasing production more than investment was implemented. The total amount of working capital occupied by the above-mentioned seven central ministries at the end of May increased by only about 4% compared to the end of 1957, while the total output value in May this year increased by about 30% compared to December 1957.

(2) Basic Construction

In the first half of the year, the amount of investment in basic construction increased by 88.1% compared to the same period last year, and by 41.4% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1956, completing 47.6% of the original state annual plan.

According to data from twenty-one departments and seventeen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, newly added fixed assets reached 1.67 billion yuan, accounting for 48.5% of the completed investment amount (44.6% in the same period last year). As of the end of June, sixty-two industrial and mining construction units above the designated size had been fully or partially put into production.

Construction project costs have generally decreased. For example, for the new production capacity being completed by Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and Yunnan Tin Company, which are under construction by the Ministry of Metallurgy, investment can be saved by half. The total investment in seven large hydropower stations under construction by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, such as Xin'anjiang, can be saved by 30%. The cost of civil construction has also been greatly reduced. According to typical survey data from Shanghai, the average cost of civil construction from January to May decreased by 12%.

In the first half of this year, 640 kilometers of railways were laid, and 3,164 kilometers of highways were built.

(3) Agricultural Production

Since last winter, the revolutionary fervor of the nation's peasants has achieved brilliant results. According to estimates from various localities, the national summer grain crop output can reach 101 billion jin, an increase of 41.3 billion jin compared to last year, or a 69% increase, breaking the record for the increase in summer grain crops in previous years. Among them, the winter wheat output is expected to reach 68.9 billion jin, an increase of 27.9 billion jin compared to last year, or a 68% increase.

The national average yield of winter wheat per mu reached 193 jin, an increase of 71% compared to last year, and an increase of 64% compared to 1956, a year of winter wheat bumper harvest. Among them, Henan Province increased by more than 100% compared to last year. Hebei Province, under the conditions of no thorough rain for more than 270 days, still increased the winter wheat yield per mu by 104% compared to last year. Henan, Hebei, Hubei and other provinces have created world record high yields of 4,000, 5,000, and 7,000 jin per mu, overturning the old idea that winter wheat is a low-yield crop.

The planting area of early rice was 156 million mu, an increase of 38 million mu compared to last year. The estimated output can reach about 80 billion jin, an increase of about 40 billion jin compared to the same period last year, doubling it. The total output of spring wheat is estimated to reach about 9 billion jin, an increase of 3 billion jin compared to last year. This year, China's wheat output will exceed the U.S. wheat output by at least 4.4 billion jin. The summer grain output, plus the early rice and spring wheat output, is about 84 billion jin more than last year, which is more than 23 billion jin more than the total grain output growth during the First Five-Year Plan.

According to preliminary estimates, the cotton planting area reached 90 million mu, an increase of more than 3 million mu compared to last year. The planting area of flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, sugar beets, peanuts and other crops has also expanded compared to last year. Due to the change from single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, the planting area of intermediate rice has been reduced by more than 30 million mu. Due to the increase in grain crops, the planting area of soybeans has been reduced by more than 30 million mu.

From October last year to June this year, the national irrigated area increased by 420 million mu, which is about twice as much as the newly added irrigated area in the past eight years, and 78% more than the total expanded irrigated area in the thousands of years before liberation. The national existing irrigated area has reached 940 million mu, accounting for 56% of the cultivated land area (31% in 1957). At the same time, 240 million mu of low-lying area management and 227,000 square kilometers of soil and water conservation control area were completed. According to incomplete statistics from nineteen provinces, 610 counties have basically realized water conservancy. During the same period, the total amount of farm manure accumulated by farm households nationwide reached 400 billion dan (including various fertilizers, mainly soil fertilizer and mud fertilizer), with an average of 24,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land. These measures have had a huge effect on this year's bumper harvest of agriculture.

The mass tool reform movement is developing vigorously. More than 90,000 kinds of improved agricultural tools have been created across the country, and more than 60 million pieces have been popularized. The era when farmers are actively innovating technology and getting rid of heavy physical labor has begun.

In the first half of the year, the national afforestation area was 321.9 million mu, which is 190% of the total afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan. 13.6 billion trees were planted beside villages, roads, rivers, and houses, and 2.97 million mu of seedlings were cultivated.

(4) Transportation

With the leap forward in production and construction, cargo transportation has also grown rapidly. In the first half of the year, the freight volume and freight turnover of modern transportation tools nationwide increased by 26% and 18% respectively compared with the same period last year, which is higher than the growth rate in the same period of previous years.

The efficiency of water and land transportation has greatly improved. The Beijing and Shanghai Railway Bureaus created the highest record of 1.06 million tons of kilometers per day for the average monthly locomotive. In June, the national locomotive daily output increased by 31.7% compared with January. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the number of barges towed by some tugboats has increased by about 100%. Night navigation in the lower reaches of the Sichuan River has been successful, and the voyage has been shortened. The unit cost of water and land transportation has been greatly reduced compared with the same period last year.

The upsurge of the entire Party and all the people running transportation is also gradually forming. According to statistics from eleven provinces including Hunan, Fujian, Henan, and Shandong, more than 21,000 kilometers of simple roads were built in the first half of the year, accounting for 68% of the mileage built during the First Five-Year Plan.

The mass transport tool reform movement is booming. According to preliminary statistics from five provinces including Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, by the end of June, nearly 40% of the townships had basically achieved vehicle mechanization, saving a lot of labor.

(5) Commodity Market

In the Great Leap Forward in production, the commodity market has maintained an active and stable situation. The sales of agricultural means of production have been unprecedentedly active, the supply of consumer goods has eased, inventories are abundant, and prices have fallen slightly.

In the first half of the year, the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 4.3% compared with the same period last year. The supply of agricultural means of production increased by 100% compared with the same period last year. The retail sales of twenty-nine rural markets increased by 8.9% compared with the same period last year. Retail sales in thirty-two large and medium-sized cities decreased by 5%.

Compared with the same period last year, the sales volume of major commodities increased by 2.2% for grain, 1.2% for pork, and 9.8% for sugar.

Commercial departments have tried every possible means to organize the supply of agricultural means of production. In the first half of the year, the main materials supplied were: 358,000 horsepower of various power machinery, an increase of more than four times compared with the same period last year; 305,000 double-wheel double-share plows, an increase of more than thirteen times compared with the same period last year; 570,000 iron waterwheels, an increase of six times compared with the same period last year; 27.5 million dan of chemical fertilizer, an increase of one times compared with the same period last year.

The purchase of agricultural and sideline products is good. In the first half of the year, the total value of agricultural and sideline products purchased by state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises increased by 28.8% compared with the same period last year. The purchase volume of grain and cotton both exceeded the plan.

At the end of June, the total commodity inventory of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises increased by about 24% compared with the end of June last year.

In the first half of the year, the retail price index of the eight major cities fell by 0.3% compared with the same period last year.

(6) Other

In the Great Leap Forward in production, major changes have taken place in the distribution of labor in various sectors of the national economy. At the end of June, the number of employees nationwide reached 25.19 million, an increase of about 700,000 compared with the end of 1957. Among them: industrial enterprises increased by about 990,000, construction and installation enterprises increased by about 280,000, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology increased by about 240,000; commercial and catering industries decreased by about 550,000, and state organs decreased by about 340,000. The characteristic of the changes in the number of employees in various departments this year is that the number of people in the material production sector has increased, while the number of people in the circulation sector and state management departments has decreased. This is a major shift to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward.

The source of the increase in employees is mainly the transformation of handicrafts and the transfer of demobilized soldiers. It is estimated that about 200,000 employees were recruited from society.

In terms of culture and education, according to incomplete statistics, 1,240 counties nationwide have universalized primary school education, there are 68,000 private middle schools, and 400 new local universities have been established. Some townships and communities have also started scientific research work. Universities that were out of reach for farmers in the old society have been established in rural areas. The literacy campaign has been further carried out. About 90 million people across the country have participated in literacy learning. 444 counties across the country have basically eliminated illiteracy. Rural cultural activities are unprecedentedly active. The patriotic health movement to eliminate the four pests has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,500 new rural hospitals have been built in the first half of the year, and about 30 counties have hospitals in every township.

    六亿人民的冲天干劲把一切保守思想一扫而光
    上半年工农业大跃进创造了惊人奇迹
    工业产值比去年同期增长34％　粮食比去年增产八百四十亿斤
    新建三十多万个地方工业单位　四百四十四县基本上消灭文盲
    新华社2日讯　在建设社会主义的总路线光辉照耀下，今年上半年全国人民发挥了冲天的革命干劲，工农业生产和建设事业逐月以更高的速度飞跃发展。粮食夏收产量已获得空前大丰收，再加上早稻的丰收，今年预计可增产八百多亿斤；在成千项大中型建设工程加快进度的同时，出现了三百万个农业社办的工业单位和三十多万个乡、县、专区和省、市兴办的工业企业；工业新产品数以万计，群众性的技术革新运动风起云涌，不断出现超过国际水平的生产技术新纪录；市场活跃、商品库存充裕。
    下面是国家统计局提供的1958年上半年国民经济计划执行情况的数字，这些数字构成了一幅前所未有的国民经济各部门相互配合、互相促进的全面大跃进的宏伟图景。
    （一）工业生产
    今年上半年全国工业和手工业（不包括农业社办工业）总产值比去年同期增长34％，其中工业（不包括手工业）总产值也比去年同期增长34％，超过历年增长速度（曾经出现过跃进高潮的1956年上半年，增长速度为26％），完成国家原订的年计划58％。
    上半年工业生产逐月以更高的速度跃进。各月比去年同月的增长速度自1月份起依次为14％，18％，29％，42％，46％，55％。
    各地贯彻执行全党全民办工业的方针以后，地方工业遍地开花。上半年全国新建的省、专、县、乡各级所办地方工业单位已达三十多万个，总产值约八亿元。其中省、专、县级工业企业约九万个，产值约七亿元，乡办工业企业约二十一万多个，产值约一亿元。此外，农业社办的工业单位约三百万个以上，产值约十三亿元。新建工业企业大批投入生产，对第二季全国工业的高速度发展起了很大作用。
    在新建地方工业中，绝大部分是直接为农业生产服务的，如肥料和饲料的加工，农产品的简单加工和农具的修配制造等。在此期间，依靠群众用土办法办起来的原材料、燃料、动力工业也越来越多，据不完全统计，上半年已建成炼铁炉一万一千多座，其中小高炉九百多座，小电站二万多个，小水泥窑一万多个，小煤窑八千多个。
    上半年工业产品产量绝大多数比去年同期有很大增长。三十五种主要产品中，电力产量增长30％；原煤增长46％；原油增长32％；生铁增长33％；钢增长26％；氮肥增长65％；机床增长近一倍；电动机增长一倍以上。
    技术革新运动已普遍展开，新产品试制品种数较往年有突出的增加。上半年辽宁、上海等十六个省市试制成功的新产品共两万七千种，对国民经济发展将发生重大作用。
    今年6月底全国工业企业职工比去年底增加了九十九万人。上半年全部工业职工劳动生产率约比去年提高24％。
    上半年全国重点工业企业成本比去年降低6.8％，其中中央煤炭、电力、石油、冶金、化工、第一机械、建筑工程（原建材部企业）等七个工业部企业成本比去年降低7.6％，已超过国家原定年计划降低成本的指标（5.9％）；地方重点企业成本降低5.5％。
    在流动资金方面贯彻执行了增产不增资或多增产少增资的方针，上述中央七个部5月末占用流动资金总额比1957年末仅增加4％左右，而今年5月份总产值则比1957年12月份增长了30％左右。
    （二）基本建设
    上半年基本建设投资额比去年同期增长88.1％，比大跃进的1956年同期还增长41.4％，完成国家原定年计划的47.6％。
    根据二十一个部门及十七个省、市、自治区的资料，新增固定资产达十六点七亿元，占投资完成额的48.5％（去年同期为44.6％）。截止6月底，已经全部和部分投入生产的限额以上工矿建设单位有六十二个。
    建设工程造价普遍降低，如冶金部正在施工的鞍钢、武钢、包钢及太原钢铁厂、云南锡业公司等单位完成原计划的新增生产能力，投资可以节约一半；水利电力部正在施工的新安江等七个大型水电站的全部投资可以节约30％。民用建筑造价也有很大降低，根据上海市典型调查资料，1—5月份民用建筑造价平均降低12％。
    今年上半年铁路铺轨六百四十公里，修建公路三千一百六十四公里。
    （三）农业生产
    去冬以来全国农民排山倒海的革命干劲，已获得了辉煌的战果。全国夏收粮食作物产量，根据各地预计可达一千零一十亿斤，比去年增产四百一十三亿斤，即增长69％，打破了历年夏收粮食作物的增产纪录。其中冬小麦产量预计可达六百八十九亿斤，比去年增产二百七十九亿斤，即增长68％。
    全国冬小麦每亩平均产量达到一百九十三斤，比去年提高71％，比冬小麦丰收的1956年还提高64％。其中河南比去年跃增一倍以上。河北省在二百七十多天无透雨的情况下，冬小麦亩产还比去年提高104％。河南、河北、湖北等省创造了亩产四千、五千、七千多斤的世界最高丰产纪录，推翻了冬小麦是低产作物的陈旧观念。
    早稻播种面积一亿五千六百万亩，比去年增加三千八百万亩，预计产量可达八百亿斤左右，比去年同期增产约四百亿斤，翻了一翻。春小麦总产量估计可达九十亿斤左右，比去年增产三十亿斤。今年我国小麦产量至少超过美国小麦产量四十多亿斤。夏收粮食产量加上早稻和春小麦产量共比去年增产八百四十亿斤左右，比第一个五年计划期内粮食产量增长总数还多二百三十多亿斤。
    棉花播种面积，据初步预计，达九千万亩，比去年增加三百多万亩；烤烟、甘蔗、甜菜、花生等作物的播种面积也较去年扩大；中稻播种面积，由于单季稻改双季稻，缩减了三千多万亩；大豆播种面积由于粮食作物的增加，减少了三千多万亩。
    从去年10月到今年6月，全国增加灌溉面积四点二亿亩，比过去八年来新增灌溉面积约多一倍，比解放前几千年来扩大灌溉面积总和还多78％。全国现有灌溉面积已达九点四亿亩，占耕地面积的56％（1957年占31％）；同时完成洼地治理面积二点四亿亩，水土保持控制面积二十二点七万平方公里。据十九个省不完全统计，基本实现水利化的县已有六百一十个。同一期间全国农家积肥总量达四千亿担（包括各种肥料，主要是土肥和泥肥），平均每亩耕地有肥料二点四万斤。这些措施对于今年农业的丰产已发生了巨大的作用。
    群众性的工具改革运动正在蓬勃开展，全国创造改良农具达九万多种，推广六千余万件。农民积极革新技术，摆脱繁重体力劳动的时代已经开始。
    上半年全国造林面积三万二千一百九十万亩，为第一个五年计划期间造林面积总和的190％，村旁、路旁、河旁、宅旁植树一百三十六亿株，育苗二百九十七万亩。
    （四）交通运输
    货物运输随着生产建设的跃进也有了很快的增长。上半年全国现代化运输工具的货运量和货物周转量较去年同期增长26％和18％，高于历年同期的增长幅度。
    水陆运输的效率都有很大提高。北京、上海两铁路局创造了月平均机车日产一百零六万吨公里的最高纪录，6月份全国机车日产量较1月份提高了31.7％。长江中下游部分拖轮拖带驳船数量增加约一倍；川江下游夜航成功，航期缩短。水陆运输单位成本比去年同期大大降低。
    全党全民办交通的高潮也正在逐渐形成，据湖南、福建、河南、山东等十一个省统计，上半年共修简易公路二万一千余公里，为第一个五年计划期间修建里程的68％。
    群众性的运输工具改革运动正在蓬勃开展，据湖北、湖南、江西等五个省初步统计，到6月底已近40％的乡基本上实现了车子化，节约了大量的劳动力。
    （五）商品市场
    在生产大跃进中，商品市场一直保持活跃和稳定的局面，农业生产资料的销售空前活跃，生活消费品供应缓和，库存充裕，物价微微下降。
    上半年社会商品零售额比去年同期增长4.3％；农业生产资料供应比去年同期增长一倍。二十九个农村市场的零售额比去年同期增长8.9％；三十二个大中城市零售额下降5％。
    主要商品的销售量与去年同期比较，粮食增2.2％，猪增1.2％，食糖增9.8％。
    商业部门千方百计组织了农业生产资料的供应，上半年供应的主要物资有：各种动力机械三十五点八万马力，比去年同期增长四倍多；双轮双铧犁三十点五万部，比去年同期增长十三倍多；铁制水车五十七万部，比去年同期增长六倍；化肥二千七百五十万担，比去年同期增长一倍。
    农副产品收购情况良好。上半年国营、合作社商业收购农副产品总值比去年同期增加28.8％；粮食和棉花征购量都超过计划。
    6月末，国营、合作社商业的商品库存总额较去年6月底约增24％。
    上半年八大城市的零售物价指数较去年同期下降0.3％。
    （六）其他
    在生产大跃进中，国民经济各部门劳动力的分配状况发生了重大的变化。6月底，全国职工人数达到二千五百一十九万人，比1957年底增加七十万人左右，其中：工业企业约增加九十九万余人，建筑安装企业约增加二十八万人，农林水利气象约增加二十四万人；商业和饮食业约减少五十万余人，国家机关约减少三十四万人。今年各部门职工变化的特点是物质生产部门人数增加，而流通环节和国家管理部门的人数减少，这是适应大跃进形势的一个重大转变。
    职工增加的来源，主要是手工业的转化和复员军人的转业，从社会上招收的职工估计约二十万人左右。
    文化教育方面，据不完全统计，全国已有一千二百四十个县普及了小学教育，民办中学达六点八万所，地方新办的高等学校达四百余所，有些乡、社也搞起了科学研究工作，旧社会农民高不可攀的高等学校已在农村中建立起来。扫盲运动进一步开展，全国参加扫盲学习的人数约达九千余万人，全国已有四百四十四个县基本上扫除了文盲。农村文化活动空前活跃。爱国卫生除四害运动取得了巨大成绩，上半年新建的乡村医院据不完全统计达二千五百多所，约有三十多个县已经乡乡有医院。
