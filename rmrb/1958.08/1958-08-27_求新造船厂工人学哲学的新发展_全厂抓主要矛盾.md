Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai Qiu Xin Shipyard workers have seen new developments in their study of philosophy and technology: the Philosophy Research Institute and Shipbuilding University recently established within the factory closely integrate the study of dialectics and materialism, the study of science and technology, and the great leap forward in production of all employees, solving key problems in the great leap forward ideologically and technically, and systematically cultivating workers into new-type laborers with high political consciousness and mastery of modern science and technology.

The greatest characteristic of the Qiu Xin Shipyard's Philosophy Research Institute is that the study of each philosophical principle is closely linked to the key problems existing in the factory's production.

The various philosophy groups studied Chairman Mao's work "On Contradiction," clarified the principle of what a contradiction is and that grasping the principal contradiction can better promote the development of things. They then analyzed that the current principal contradiction of the factory is that the principal product, the 250-horsepower hybrid trawler, is urgently needed but the production cycle is too long. It is necessary to concentrate major efforts to achieve the leap forward target of shortening the shipbuilding cycle from 351 days to 82 days.

As a result, the workers' consciousness has been greatly improved, and the slogan "Everything for 82 days!" has been loudly proposed. The cold work section of the repair and construction workshop initially believed that their section mainly repaired salvaged sunken ships, and the trawler task only accounted for about 20% of the entire section's tasks. Therefore, other sections were booming, while they were deserted. Some even said that it was not necessary to shorten the shipbuilding cycle, as it would disrupt their plan to repair sunken ships. When discussing the principal contradiction, the workers debated this issue. Many workers pointed out that there are different contradictions in the development of complex things, one of which must be the principal contradiction. Because of its existence and development, it will inevitably affect the existence and development of other contradictions. Based on the relationship between the principal and secondary contradictions, they pointed out that shortening the shipbuilding cycle to 82 days is precisely the key to driving all work in the factory. On the basis of a unified understanding, the cold workers also took active action, so that the work of repairing sunken ships, which was originally in danger of being overdue, also made a leap forward, so that it was not overdue.

At the same time, the Shipbuilding University also started by explaining why it used to take 351 days to build a trawler, and now it only takes 82 days. The Qiu Xin Shipyard Party Committee has made preliminary plans for workers' philosophy and technology learning: Philosophy Research Institute students will complete the study of dialectics, materialism, and historical materialism in two years, while strengthening theoretical publicity so that all employees will understand philosophical common sense in about one year; Shipbuilding University students will reach the level of secondary technical school students in two to three years according to their majors, and the level of higher vocational school students in about six years.

### 求新造船厂工人学哲学的新发展  全厂抓主要矛盾

　　求新造船厂工人学哲学的新发展
    全厂抓主要矛盾
    据新华社讯  上海求新造船厂工人学哲学、学技术有了新的发展：厂内最近成立的哲学研究学院和造船大学，将全厂职工的辩证法和唯物论学习、科学技术学习和生产跃进再跃进紧密结合起来，从思想上、技术上解决大跃进中的关键问题，有计划地把工人培养成为具有高度政治自觉的，掌握现代科学技术的新型劳动者。
    求新造船厂哲学研究学院最大的特点是，每一个哲学原理的学习，都密切结合着厂内生产中存在的关键性问题。
    各个哲学小组学习了毛主席的著作“矛盾论”，明确了什么是矛盾和抓住主要矛盾就能更好地推动事物发展的道理，接着就分析出工厂当前的主要矛盾是主要产品二百五十马力混合式拖网渔轮，需要非常迫切而生产周期太长，必须集中主要力量实现将造船周期由三百五十一天缩短为八十二天的跃进指标。
    这样一来，职工们的自觉性大大提高，“一切为了八十二天！”的口号响亮地提出来了。修造车间冷作工段的工人们起初认为自己工段主要是修理打捞上来的沉船，渔轮任务只占整个工段任务的20％左右，因此别的工段轰轰烈烈，他们冷冷清清。有人还说，缩短造船周期没有必要，这样会打乱他们修理沉船的计划。讨论主要矛盾的时候，工人们对这个问题展开了争论。许多工人指出，在复杂的事物发展中有不同矛盾存在，其中必然有一个主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，必然影响其他矛盾的存在和发展。他们根据主要矛盾和次要矛盾的关系指出，缩短造船周期到八十二天，正是带动厂内一切工作的纲。在认识一致的基础上，冷作工人们也积极行动起来，使原来有脱期危险的修理沉船的工作也跃进了一步，不致于脱期了。
    与此同时，造船大学也从缩短造船周期为八十二天开始讲起，说明为什么过去造一条渔轮要三百五十一天，现在只要八十二天就够了。求新造船厂党委会已对职工哲学和技术学习作了初步规划：哲学研究学院学员以二年时间学完辩证法、唯物论和历史唯物主义，同时加强理论宣传，使全厂职工一年左右懂得哲学常识；造船大学学员按各人专业在两年至三年内达到中等技术学校学生水平，六年左右达到高等专科学校学生水平。
