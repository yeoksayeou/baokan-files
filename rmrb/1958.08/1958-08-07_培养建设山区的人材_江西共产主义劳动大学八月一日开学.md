Cultivating Talent for Mountain Area Construction
Jiangxi Communist Labor University Opens August 1st

(Our reporter Liu Guanghui reports) The Jiangxi Province-established Communist Labor University's main campus and its thirty branch campuses attached to reclamation farms in Jinggang Mountain, Da Mao Mountain, Lushan Mountain, etc., all opened on August 1st.

The Communist Labor University plans to enroll 50,000 students this year, including 25,000 recruited from society and 25,000 recommended by agricultural cooperatives. Currently, 20,000 students have been admitted. As of August 1st, 11,000 students have arrived at the schools. The majority of the students are educated youth of worker-peasant origin, but there are also workers, farmers, handicraft cooperative members, agricultural cooperative directors, demobilized veterans, and young students from eight provinces, including Shandong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong.

The classrooms and dormitories of the Communist Labor University were built by the teachers and students themselves, and the students' meals are earned through their own labor.

Currently, each branch school has established laboratories, horticultural farms, experimental farms, and various experimental factories in conjunction with the reclamation farm's botanical and zoological research gardens.

The entire university has six majors: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, industry, fishery, and sericulture. Each major is further divided into several departments. Each branch school establishes majors based on the above six majors and according to the different characteristics of production in each mountain reclamation farm. The study period for each department of the Communist Labor University's undergraduate program is four years, and the study period for each specialty is two years. In the first semester of this year, the school will not divide into departments but will uniformly teach political theory courses and general technical knowledge. In the second semester, students will study according to the nature of each department.

In addition to transferring a portion of experienced cadres and engineers, writers, and scientists with relatively rich production and cultural knowledge from various comprehensive reclamation farms to serve as professors, the school has also hired leading cadres from the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and various departments and bureaus, led by Yang Shangkui, to give lectures.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that during the Second Five-Year Plan, Jiangxi's Communist Labor University will develop from the current one main campus and thirty branch campuses to one hundred to one hundred and twenty, cultivating 400,000 to 480,000 university students, so that Communist Labor University students will be spread throughout the mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province.

    培养建设山区的人材
    江西共产主义劳动大学八月一日开学
    本报讯　记者刘光辉报道：江西省创办的共产主义劳动大学总校和附设在井冈山、大茅山、庐山等三十个垦殖场的三十所分校都已在8月1日开学。
    共产主义劳动大学今年预计招收五万人，其中在社会上招收二万五千人，由农业社保送二万五千人，目前已录取二万人。截至8月1日止，已经到校的学生有一万一千人，大部分学生是工农知识青年，也有工人、农民、手工业社员、农业社主任、转业复员军人，还有来自山东、江苏、四川、广东等八省的青年学生。
    共产主义劳动大学的教室、宿舍是教师和学生亲自修建的，学生的伙食是从自己劳动中换来的。
    目前，每个分校都结合垦殖场动植物研究园成立了试验室、园艺场、试验农场和各种试验工厂。
    全校共设农业、林业、畜牧业、工业、渔业、蚕桑等六个专业，每个专业下面又分设若干科系；每个分校，根据以上六个专业和按照山区各垦殖场生产上不同的特点分别设立专业。共产主义劳动大学本科各系学习期限为四年，各专科学习期限为二年。学校今年第一学期将不分科系，统一讲授政治理论课和一般的技术知识，第二学期便按照各科系的性质分科系学习。
    学校除了在各综合垦殖场抽调一部分具有较丰富的生产和文化知识的下放干部和工程师、作家、科学家担任教授外；并聘请以杨尚奎为首的省委、省人民委员会、各厅、局领导干部担任讲课。
    中共江西省委已决定：在第二个五年计划期间，江西的共产主义劳动大学将由现在的一个总校、三十个分校发展到一百至一百二十个，培养出大学生四十万至四十八万人，使共产主义劳动大学的学生遍布江西全省山区。
