　　Fully Utilizing Sunlight to Increase Production
    Ding County Promotes the Method of Trellising Sweet Potatoes
    (Our Tianjin Dispatch, August 21st) The agricultural production cooperatives of Ding County are employing the method of trellising sweet potatoes, raising the vines off the ground to promote increased production by utilizing sunlight.

    According to recent statistics, the cooperatives throughout the county have already erected trellises for more than 9,000 mu of high-yield fields and have trained the vines onto the trellises. Currently, the cooperatives are preparing materials in large quantities to continue promoting this production-increasing measure.

    According to an investigation and analysis by the Ding County Party Committee, the benefits of trellising sweet potatoes are: First, enhanced sunlight, improved ventilation, and vigorous stems and leaves. Trellised sweet potatoes (twenty days after trellising) grow an average of 113 green leaves per plant, while non-trellised plants only have 78 leaves. The rate of vine rot in trellised sweet potatoes is 1/30, while the rate of vine rot in non-trellised sweet potatoes is 1/15, more than double that of trellised sweet potatoes. Second, after the vines climb onto the trellis, the ground cover is reduced, enhancing sunlight on the sweet potato fields, increasing the ground temperature, which is suitable for sweet potato growth. Third, trellising sweet potatoes enhances photosynthesis in the leaves and intensifies underground water evaporation, which can also control excessive vine growth. The high-yield sweet potatoes in this county's pig farm only grew stems and leaves before trellising and did not form sweet potato tubers; after trellising, this phenomenon of excessive growth quickly reversed. Fourth, trellising sweet potatoes can save labor. According to local conditions, the labor involved in tasks such as lifting vines and cooling ridges requires about six workdays per mu. After using three or four workdays to erect trellises, the vines climb onto the trellis, and the tasks of lifting vines and cooling ridges are replaced. In this way, two or three workdays can be saved per mu of sweet potatoes.

    The Xijianyang and other advanced agricultural cooperatives in this county began experimenting with trellising management in 1956 and created experience in increasing production through trellising. This year, the county's 700,000 sweet potato seedlings are growing particularly densely. Many of the better sweet potato fields have dense stems and leaves, covering the ground, which affects ventilation and sunlight, hindering sweet potato growth. In some sweet potato fields, there are even phenomena of vine rot, leaf rot, and excessive vine growth. Based on the above situation, the Ding County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to vigorously promote the management measure of trellising sweet potatoes to increase sunlight exposure.

### 充分利用太阳光增产  定县推广甘薯搭架的方法

　　充分利用太阳光增产
    定县推广甘薯搭架的方法
    本报天津21日电　定县各农业生产合作社正用甘薯搭架的方法，将甘薯蔓从地皮上架起来，利用日光促进甘薯增产。
    据最近统计，全县各社已将九千多亩高额丰产田的架搭好，并将薯蔓架起来。现在，各社正在大量准备物料，继续推行这项增产措施。
    根据定县县委的调查分析，甘薯搭架后的好处是：一、日照增强，通风透光，茎叶茂盛。搭架甘薯（搭架二十天后）平均每株生长绿叶一百一十三个，不搭架的只有七十八个叶。搭架甘薯的烂蔓率是三十分之一，不搭架甘薯的烂蔓率是十五分之一，多过搭架甘薯一倍。二、薯蔓爬到架上后，减少了地面的复被，薯田地面日照增强，地温增高适于甘薯生长。三、甘薯搭架后叶的光合作用增强，地下水份蒸发加剧，还可以控制薯秧徒长。这县猪场的丰产甘薯，不搭架前光长茎叶，不结薯块，搭架后，这种疯秧现象很快就转变过来。四、甘薯搭架能节省劳力。根据当地情况，甘薯提蔓凉埂等工活，每亩约需用工六个左右，用三四个工搭架后，薯蔓往架上爬，提蔓凉埂等工活就被代替了。这样，每亩甘薯便可节约两三个工。
    这个县的西建阳等一些先进的农业社，从1956年开始就作搭架管理的试验，并创造了搭架增产的经验。今年，全县的七十万甘薯苗长得特别密茂，许多较好的甘薯，茎叶密集，封盖住地面，影响了通风透光，妨碍着甘薯生长。有些薯田，甚至发生烂蔓烂叶和疯秧现象。根据上述情况，中共定县县委便确定大力推广甘薯搭架增加日照的管理措施。
