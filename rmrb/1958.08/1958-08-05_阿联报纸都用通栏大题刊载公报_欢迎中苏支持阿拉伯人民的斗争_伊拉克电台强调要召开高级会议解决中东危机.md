Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 4th: Cairo newspapers today all used full-width headlines on their front pages to publish the news of the meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong and the full text of the communiqué, along with photos of the two leaders. The United Arab Republic Radio and the Middle East News Agency both broadcast the communiqué.

On the afternoon of August 3rd, many people called the Cairo branch of Xinhua News Agency to request the full text of the communiqué.

Cairo newspapers noted with great satisfaction that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had expressed complete agreement on the measures necessary to safeguard world peace. The newspapers particularly highlighted the passage in the communiqué that firmly supports the just struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and other countries that defend national independence and freedom.

The "Al-Ahram" newspaper published an editorial praising the meeting communiqué as "a noble call for peace and a warning to war and those who want to launch it."

The editorial said, "This is a unified voice against the Anglo-American threat of aggression that endangers world peace."

The "Al-Ahram" editorial concluded by condemning U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' "brink of war" policy and pointing out that "Dulles should read the communiqué issued by Khrushchev and Mao Zedong very carefully."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 4th: After the Sino-Soviet meeting communiqué was published yesterday, Damascus Radio broadcast a detailed summary of the communiqué several times in Arabic, English, and French. The evening newspapers also rushed to publish news of the Sino-Soviet meeting and the communiqué.

Today, most of the daily newspapers here published the full text of the meeting communiqué in prominent positions and with full-width headlines. Many newspapers also published photos of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

"Al-Nasr" newspaper published the full text of the communiqué on the front page under the full-width headline: "Russia and China Insist on Preventing Aggression, They Reached an Agreement on Necessary Measures. These two countries insist on the immediate withdrawal of British and American troops and support the struggle of the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq." It also commented that three-quarters of the world's population now accuses Anglo-American aggression and demands their immediate withdrawal, because this communiqué was issued in the name of 800 million people and has gained the support of another 1 billion peace-loving people around the world.

"Al-Nour" newspaper published the full text of the communiqué on the front page under the full-width headline: "Khrushchev and Mao Zedong Warn Aggressors and Firmly Support Arab Countries. If the imperialists launch a war, all countries will eliminate them."

This newspaper reports from Baghdad: Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast a summary of the Khrushchev-Mao Zedong meeting communiqué on the 3rd. The broadcast particularly emphasized that Khrushchev and Mao Zedong strongly support the convening of a summit meeting between East and West to resolve the current crisis in the Near and Middle East.
