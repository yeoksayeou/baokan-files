Find Every Way to Comprehensively Utilize Coal
Commentator of this newspaper

Comprehensive utilization of coal is attracting more and more attention. Zhongliangshan Coal Mine is preparing to transition from a single coal production enterprise to a comprehensive joint enterprise in the process of expansion; Tianjin No. 2 Power Plant recovered coal tar during the coal combustion process; Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant is also actively working to recover by-products from coal and use coal ash to produce high-grade cement; the staff of the Shanghai Ceramic Research Institute used indigenous methods to extract metallic aluminum from coal ash. All these are good beginnings.

China's coal resources have many excellent conditions: abundant reserves, widespread distribution, and excellent quality. Unfortunately, its usage still remains at the low-level form of direct combustion, and the thermal efficiency is very low. For example, the thermal efficiency of trains is 6%, cooking is 15%, and power stations are about 20%. Assuming an average thermal efficiency of 15%, then only 15 million tons of coal play a role in burning 100 million tons of coal, and the rest of the coal is equivalent to being thrown away for nothing. Of course, it is impossible to imagine that all the thermal energy in coal will be fully utilized, but with people's efforts, it is entirely possible to maximize the utilization of thermal energy. However, the problem that deserves attention at present is not only that the thermal energy of coal has not been fully utilized, but more importantly, coal contains a large amount of oil and valuable chemical raw materials, which are wasted in vain during direct combustion. For many years, people have called coal black gold. In fact, the actual use of coal is by no means comparable to gold. Gold cannot be directly used in daily life. Coal is the mother of the chemical industry. It is a polymer compound that stores a variety of materials directly or indirectly related to clothing, food, housing, transportation, and use. If used properly, it can produce a large amount of fertilizer, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, synthetic alcohols, and synthetic oils. It can produce plastics to replace metals and wood, produce pharmaceutical and pesticide products, and produce various dyes. In addition, coal ash can also be used as building materials such as cement and bricks. Someone calculated: One hundred million tons of directly burned bituminous coal, in addition to burning for power generation, if low-temperature carbonization and tar hydrogenation methods are used, can extract 7.5 million tons of tar and 490,000 tons of pure benzene. These pure benzenes can be made into 330,000 tons of capron, which is equivalent to more than 46 million dan of cotton. What a huge number this is!

Some people say that it is not a simple matter to utilize all the elements in coal without any waste. This involves many issues such as technology, equipment, and investment. Some issues are important topics in the technical revolution. Yes, there are indeed many problems, but the existence of these problems does not affect people's comprehensive utilization of coal. Under today's conditions, there may be two programs for the utilization of coal: one is the highest program, which requires the units that consume the most coal to appropriately add some equipment to recover tar and coal gas to create more chemical products for the country. The other is the lowest program, which requires comprehensive utilization as much as possible, making subjective efforts, and utilizing as much as possible. If all power plants and coal-consuming units can recover coal tar during the combustion process like Tianjin No. 2 Power Plant, then the coal tar gathered across the country will be a great wealth.

It should be admitted that the lack of technical strength has a certain impact on the comprehensive utilization of coal, but what hinders the progress of the cause at present is not entirely a technical issue, but whether we dare to think and dare to do it. For example, many rural areas have already made cement and refined tar using indigenous methods. Why can't cities and factories with better conditions make such cement and refine such tar? In the era when scientific knowledge was underdeveloped, people's understanding of material resources was greatly limited, and therefore the utilization of materials had great limitations. When history enters the atomic age and the plastic age today, people's understanding has long broken through the old boundaries. Things that were originally used for only one purpose, science has proved that they are multi-purpose resources. Advanced enterprise departments have already used materials that could only manufacture one product to manufacture a variety of products. Therefore, although technical conditions and technical strength are very important conditions, the deciding factor is first of all the degree of ideological emancipation. It is often the case that when the mind is liberated, people try every means to make up their minds to do what they want to do. Even if they encounter this or that difficulty, because they have the determination and add every means, then what they are determined to do will be done. Otherwise, if you hesitate and have many concerns, nothing can be done well.

Comprehensive utilization of coal is the most powerful technical policy to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. With the great development of industry and agriculture, the demand for coal is very large. Implementing this policy will not only promote a large increase in production in all relevant industries, agriculture, and transportation, but also ensure the greatest conservation of coal resources. In our country, the comprehensive utilization of coal is still a new issue, which is closely related to the metallurgical industry, chemical industry, coal refining industry, power fuel, industrial fuel, and civil fuel. It requires a comprehensive plan to minimize the proportion of direct combustion of coal. However, we cannot wait for a comprehensive plan. Because waiting one day is equivalent to losing one day's worth of materials. For the sake of more, faster, better, and more economical results, we must also use both indigenous and foreign methods, combine large and small, and try every means to grab back the materials that are running away in the comprehensive utilization of coal.

    想一切办法综合利用煤炭
    本报评论员
    煤炭的综合利用愈来愈引起人们的注意。中梁山煤矿在扩建过程中准备把单一的生产煤炭企业过渡到综合性的联合企业；天津第二发电厂在煤炭的燃烧过程中回收了煤焦油；北京石景山发电厂也在积极动手把煤炭中的副产品回收起来，并且利用煤灰生产高标号水泥；上海陶瓷研究所的职工用土办法从煤灰里取出了金属铝。所有这些都是良好的开端。
    我国煤炭资源有着许多优异的条件：储量丰富，分布普遍，质量优良。可惜，在使用上仍然停留在直接燃烧的低级形式，而且热效能利用很低。如火车的热效率为6％，炊事为15％，电站约20％。假定平均热效率15％计算，那末，燃烧一亿吨煤只有一千五百万吨起作用，其余的煤炭等于白白扔掉了。当然，不能设想煤炭中的所有热能完全发挥作用，但是，经过人们的努力，使热能利用到最大限度是完全可能的。然而，当前值得注意的问题，不仅在于煤炭的热能没有得到充分利用，更重要的还在于煤炭当中含有大量油品和宝贵的化工原料，在直接燃烧过程中白白浪费了。多少年来，人们把煤叫做黑色金子。其实，煤的实际用途，绝非金子可以比拟。金子不能直接用到日常生活上去，煤是化学工业之母，它是高分子化合物，其中储藏着直接或间接与衣、食、住、行、用有关的多种材料。如果利用得当，可以生产大量的肥料，生产合成纤维，合成橡胶，合成醇类，合成油脂，可以生产塑料代替金属和木材，生产医药农药制品，还可以生产各种染料。另外，煤灰还可以用来做水泥、砖瓦等建筑材料。有人计算：一亿吨直接燃烧的烟煤，除了燃烧发电以外，如果以低温干馏和焦油加氢的方法，可以提炼出七百五十万吨焦油和四十九万吨精苯，这些精苯可制卡普纶三十三万吨，相当于四千六百多万担的棉花，这是多么巨大的数字啊！
    有人说，要把煤炭里的各种元素通统利用起来，没有一点儿浪费，不是一件简单的事情，这里涉及到技术、设备、投资等许多问题，有些问题是技术革命中的重要课题。是的，问题确实很多，但是，这些问题的存在，并不影响人们对煤炭的综合利用。在今天的条件下，对于煤炭的利用问题，不妨可以有两个纲领：一个是最高纲领，要求耗煤最多的单位，适当地增添一些设备，把焦油、煤气回收起来，为国家创制更多的化学产品。另一个是最低纲领，要求尽可能地综合利用，尽主观努力，能利用多少就利用多少。如果所有的发电厂和耗煤单位都能像天津第二发电厂一样，在燃烧过程中回收煤焦油，那末，全国各地聚集起来的煤焦油将是一笔很大的财富。
    应当承认技术力量不足对于煤炭的综合利用有着一定的影响，但是，当前影响事业前进的还不完全是技术问题，而是敢不敢想，敢不敢干的问题。例如许多农村里已经用土法做出水泥、炼出了焦油，为什么条件较好的城市和工厂企业就不能做出这样的水泥和炼出这样的焦油呢？在科学知识不发达的年代，人们对物质资源的认识有着很大的限制，因而对于物质的利用有着很大的局限性。当历史进入原子时代和塑料时代的今天，人们的认识能力早就突破了旧的界线。原来只作一种用途的东西，科学证明它是多种用途的资源，原来只能制造一种物品的材料，先进的企业部门已经用来制造了多种产品。所以，技术条件和技术力量尽管是十分重要的条件，而决定的因素，首先在于思想解放的程度如何。事情常常是这样：思想解放了，想干的事情千方百计地下决心去干，纵然遇到这样那样的困难，因为有了决心，又加上千方百计，那末，决心想干的事情也就干起来了。否则，犹疑不决，顾虑多端，一切事情都不能办好。
    煤炭的综合利用是实现多快好省的最有力的技术政策。在工农业大发展的情况，煤炭的需要量很大。实现这个政策，既促进一切有关工业、农业、交通运输事业大量增产，又保证煤炭资源的最大节约。在我们国家里，实行煤炭综合利用还是一个新问题，关系到冶金工业、化学工业、煤炼油工业、动力燃料、工业燃料、民用燃料等方面的密切结合，需要有一个全面规划，尽量做到降低煤的直接燃烧的比重。但是，我们不能等待全面规划。因为等待一天，就等于物资损失一天。为了多快好省，在煤炭的综合利用上也一定要土洋并举，大小结合，千方百计，尽一切努力把跑掉的物资抓回来。
