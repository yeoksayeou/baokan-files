When literature and art club activities come to the fields, the good and bad are clearly distinguished. Those who labor well are praised, and those who do poorly can correct themselves after hearing. After resting, they sing, and the labor is energetic without feeling tired.
(Zhao Bi, Xiyang, Shanxi)

　  文艺跟生产俱乐部活动到地头，是好是坏能分明，劳动好的受表扬，坏的一听能改正，休息下来把歌唱，劳动劲大不觉困。
          （山西昔阳赵壁）
