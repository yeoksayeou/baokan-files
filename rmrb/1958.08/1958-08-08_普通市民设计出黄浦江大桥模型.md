Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Shi Longyu, an ordinary Shanghai citizen who sells fermented glutinous rice, recently designed and created a model of a bridge spanning the Huangpu River. Guo Zengwang, Vice President and Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute, visited this citizen and presented him with a gift and a certificate of merit to encourage him to continue using his brains for national construction.

The bridge type designed by Shi Longyu for the Huangpu River Bridge is in the shape of a "丌". It bends the approach bridges from both ends of the main bridge along the riverbank, and at the same time proposes a drawer-type movable bridge deck that has never existed in the world, allowing large ships to pass unimpeded. The advantage of this bridge type is that it can save bridge construction investment and avoid extending the approach bridge to the bustling city center, so as to reduce the loss of demolition of houses during bridge construction.

Shi Longyu is a citizen who does not understand engineering technology and is not very literate. Seeing that Shanghai's urban area is divided into the east and west banks by the Huangpu River, he thought that a bridge should be built. When he saw in the newspaper that relevant departments in Shanghai were considering this issue, he felt very interested. He went to the river to conduct on-the-spot observations and research, and after four revisions, finally made a bridge model. Although the question of whether to build a bridge or an underwater tunnel on the Huangpu River in Shanghai has not yet been decided, the Municipal Engineering Design Institute believes that Shi Longyu's bridge type design is of great reference value.

### 普通市民设计出黄浦江大桥模型

    普通市民设计出黄浦江大桥模型
    据新华社上海7日电  上海一位卖酒酿的市民史隆裕，最近设计和创造了一座横跨黄浦江的大桥模型。上海市市政工程设计院副院长兼总工程师郭增望，访问了这位市民，并且赠给他一份礼物和一张奖状，鼓励他继续为国家建设多动脑筋。
    史隆裕设计的黄浦江大桥桥型，成“丌”字形，它把引桥从主桥两端沿着河岸弯下来，同时提出了一种世界上从未有过的抽屉式的活动桥面，使大轮船可以畅行无阻。这种桥型的好处是能节约建桥投资，避免把引桥伸向热闹的市中心，以减少建桥时拆迁房屋的损失。
    史隆裕是一位不懂工程技术、识字不多的市民。他看到上海市区被黄浦江划成民东西两岸，想到应该建设一座大桥。当他看到报上登载上海市有关部门正在考虑这个问题时，感到很大兴趣。他到江边去实地观察和研究，经过四次修改，最后做成了一个大桥模型。虽然上海黄浦江上造桥还是造水底隧道的问题尚未决定，但是市政工程设计院认为，史隆裕的桥型设计是很有参考价值的。
