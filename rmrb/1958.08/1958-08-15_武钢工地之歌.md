Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Site Song: Determined and energetic, taking five steps as one, catching up with England to build blast furnaces.
　×　×　×
Today, one more drop of sweat is shed, the refractory (factory) will produce bricks one day sooner. We are determined to build the blast furnace early, and we will not return without molten iron!
  ×　×　×
After a hundred days of hard work, the coke oven emits smoke! After seven months of hard work, the blast furnace produces iron!
