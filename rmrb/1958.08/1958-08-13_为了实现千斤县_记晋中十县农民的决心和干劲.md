　　To Realize the Thousand-Jin County
　　— Recording the Determination and Drive of Farmers in Ten Counties of Jinzhong
　　Wu Xiang, Yan Jilie
    A per-mu yield of one thousand jin of grain for the entire county would be an inspiring figure even in the south of the Yangtze River. How much more so in Jinzhong, north of the Yellow River, where the average per-mu yield used to be only a little over one hundred jin? At the beginning of July, we heard the news that the ten counties of the Jinzhong Basin would become thousand-jin counties this year. Unable to contain our excitement and surprise, we went to Qingxu, Wenshui, Fenyang, Jiexiu, Pingyao, Taigu, Yuci, and other places. For more than half a month, we traveled around the Jinzhong Basin. We saw the joy brought about by the great wheat harvest, but we were even more deeply impressed by the profound changes in the thoughts and feelings of the farmers brought about by the great wheat harvest. We also saw the boundless, lush green autumn crops in the fields, but we were even more deeply impressed by the determination and drive of thousands upon thousands of farmers to realize the thousand-jin county.

    What to Do With So Much Grain
    When we first arrived in Qingxu, it was wheat harvest season. In previous years, harvesting wheat took ten days or so, but this year the wheat was particularly good, and people's enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward was also particularly high. "Seize the sunny days, grab the cloudy days, treat windy and rainy days as good days, work from early morning until dark as if it were only half a day, and treat moonlight as daylight." It only took four or five days to finish. Everywhere was filled with tension, busyness, and laughter, like a joyous event. Elderly men also smiled and said, "I've never seen such a good year." Last year, the average per-mu yield of wheat in the Jinzhong area was only one hundred and six jin, but this year the yield in each county has generally doubled, and the per-mu yield in Jiexiu County has already reached more than three hundred and fourteen jin. Now people are no longer considering whether there will be enough grain, but rather what to do with too much grain. We visited the Nanlüshu Agricultural Cooperative in Qingxu, where cooperative director Zhang Xi was worried about not having enough麻袋麻袋; we visited the Xiaosu Agricultural Cooperative in Beixu Village, Wenshui, where the members said they would be moving in the autumn. We were very curious, but they humorously replied, "Even if we turn all the houses into warehouses, it won't be enough. What else can we do but move!"

    The Panacea
    The great wheat harvest is indeed a panacea that can enlighten even the most stubborn and conservative people. Liu Sancai's experimental field for barley was originally targeted to yield three thousand jin, which infuriated an old man named Wen Sicai in the cooperative, who swore, "If you can really harvest three thousand jin, I'll give you my head!" Until the wheat was harvested, he still didn't quite believe it, but the result was not three thousand jin, but five thousand seven hundred and two jin. The old man conceded defeat. When Liu Sancai's shock brigade experimented with yielding ten thousand jin of millet in the replanted field, he became an active supporter. How many comedies like Wen Sicai's appeared in one summer, and how many Wen Sicai-like figures experienced profound inner changes!

    The General Line has liberated the thinking of the peasants and promoted the great wheat harvest; and the great wheat harvest has further enabled the peasants to grasp the General Line, greatly liberated their thinking, and promoted autumn production by taking advantage of the summer production. On the eve of "July 1st," the whole province held a radio mobilization meeting and launched a general campaign to increase autumn grain production. The counties were eager to be first, full of confidence, and forging ahead bravely. From the places we visited, each county without exception had a considerable number of double-thousand-jin townships, five-thousand-jin cooperatives, and ten-thousand-jin production teams. As for experimental fields with yields of more than ten thousand jin, there are countless. People are really interested in experimental fields, and they want to experiment with everything: Renyi Village in Qingxu has a grape king that will yield one thousand one hundred jin, Liu Zhuang Village has corn with a per-mu yield of twenty thousand jin, Guanjia Fort in Taigu has yams with a per-mu yield of one hundred thousand jin, Shuixiu Village has sugar beets with a per-mu yield of two hundred thousand jin, Mingqian in Yuci has cotton with a per-mu yield of ten thousand jin, and Zhangqing Village has millet and sorghum with a per-mu yield of thirty thousand jin… Don't you believe it? Those experimenters will drag you to the fields to argue with you, calculating in detail how many seedlings there are per mu, and how much each seedling can produce at least; they have already taken what measures, and are continuing to take what measures, so that you can't help but be infected by their enthusiasm, convinced by their drive, and believe as deeply as they do.

    Trying Every Possible Way to Get Water and Fertilizer
    Of course, although this year's autumn crops are growing unprecedentedly well, achieving the thousand-jin county still requires extremely arduous struggle. But the peasants, whose minds have been liberated, are not afraid of any difficulties or struggles, nor do they begrudge their own efforts and energy. The most important things for achieving the thousand-jin county are water and fertilizer, so they are trying every possible way to get water and fertilizer. In late May, the counties of Jinzhong held an on-site water conservancy construction conference in Xushui, Hebei, to learn the communist style of Xushui, and in the tense agricultural season, they took out 40% to 60% of the labor force to engage in water conservancy construction. From June 1st to 20th, in twenty days, ten counties built a total of one thousand and ninety reservoirs, which can store two hundred and ten million cubic meters of water. On average, fifty-four and a half reservoirs were born every day.

    Fertilizer used to be a problem. One of the leaping measures in the counties was: "Apply three to four thousand jin of top dressing per mu." Where would so much fertilizer come from, and how would it be applied to the land? If relying on miscellaneous fertilizer wasn't enough, then process the miscellaneous fertilizer into artificial urine, which is of high quality and doesn't have to worry about not being able to apply it. Recently, the counties have been making artificial urine on a large scale. Pingyao's Jinghua Township buried two thousand large urns overnight. When Dongquan Township found out, they made a surprise attack the next day and buried ten thousand. When this batch of fertilizer is taken out of the urn, each mu of autumn field can average more than three hundred dan. Qingxu County created the experience of using bittern to make soil fertilizer, which is an even better way to solve the fertilizer problem. In less than two months, the experience of making soil fertilizer has universally blossomed and borne fruit throughout the Jinzhong Basin.

    Getting water requires people; getting fertilizer also requires people; weeding and hoeing seedlings to strengthen field management requires even more people. What to do if there is not enough labor? Do it! Mobilize all semi-auxiliary labor to do it! They are not only willing to use their strength and work hard, but also use their brains, reform tools, and let one person do the work of dozens of people. Fenyang County achieved vehicleization in three days, which can save one million laborers. In order to solve the problems of water lifting and deep hoeing, gas engines and weeding machines were also made. A weeding machine can hoe twenty-five mu of land a day, which is more than ten times more efficient than hoeing by hand. The counties are all making technical revolutions, and all walks of life have taken action. It is truly "thousands of hearts, tens of thousands of hearts, all focused on yielding one thousand jin per mu."

     Militarization of Life and Labor
    The most prominent manifestation of people's soaring drive is militarization. All male and female laborers in Qingxu County were organized into squads, platoons, companies, and battalions according to military organization. As soon as the reveille sounds in the morning, rows of neat teams immediately set off for the "battlefield." Some old ladies in their fifties are also carrying farm tools on their shoulders, teacups on their waists, and fly swatters in their hands, fully "armed." On construction sites and in fields, there are booming red and black flag competitions everywhere. Qingxu is like this, and so are all the other counties. Now the peasants have begun to have a strong sense of time. Not long ago, Pingyao County held a celebration of the wheat harvest and an oath-taking meeting for the leap forward in autumn grain production. More than ten thousand cadres, Party members, and Young Communist League activists in the county, the farthest of whom were more than eighty li from the city, were required to meet at nine o'clock in the morning, and they all arrived by eight-thirty. In order to achieve the thousand-jin county, the peasants are unwilling to let go of even a day or an hour!

　　为了实现千斤县
　　——记晋中十县农民的决心和干劲
　　吴象　阎继烈
    全县粮食亩产千斤，在江南也是令人振奋的数字，何况在黄河以北过去平均亩产只有一百多斤的晋中呢？7月初，我们听到晋中盆地十县今年就要成为千斤县的消息，实在按耐不住自己的兴奋和惊讶，便到了清徐、文水、汾阳、介休、平遥、太谷、榆次等地。半个多月中，在晋中盆地绕了个圈。我们看到了小麦大丰收带来的一片洋洋喜气，但是印象更深的却是小麦大丰收在农民思想感情上引起的深刻的变化；我们也看到了田野上一望无际油绿茁壮的秋禾，但是印象更深的却是千千万万农民实现千斤县的决心和干劲。
    粮食太多了怎么办
    刚到清徐，正是小麦登场的时候。往年割麦要十来天，今年麦子特别好，人们跃进的劲儿也特别大。“抓晴天，抢阴天，刮风下雨当好天，起早搭黑当半天，月光底下当白天。”只四五天就完了。到处是紧张、忙碌和欢笑，像办喜事一样。上了年纪的老汉们也笑眯眯地说：“永没见过这样好的年景。”晋中区去年小麦平均亩产只一百零六斤，今年各县普遍要加倍，介休县的亩产已达到三百一十四斤多。现在人们考虑的不再是粮食够不够的问题，而是太多了怎么办的问题了。我们访问过清徐南绿树农业社，社主任张玺正在为麻袋不够用发愁；我们访问过文水北徐村效苏农业社，社员们说他们村秋天要搬了。我们很奇怪，他们却幽默地回答说：“把房子都做了仓库也不够，不搬家怎么办！”
    万灵的钥匙
    麦子大丰收确实是一把万灵的钥匙，能使任何顽固保守的人开窍。刘三才他们的大麦试验田原定的指标是三千斤，竟把社里一个名叫温四才的老汉气急了，他赌咒：“你们真能打下三千斤，我拚上脑袋！”直到麦子登场，他看着事情不妙，还是不大相信，但打的结果不是三千斤，而是五千七百零二斤。老汉服输了，当刘三才突击组再试验在回茬地产万斤谷子的时候，他就变成了积极的支持者了。一个夏天，出现了多少温四才式的喜剧，有多少温四才式的人物经历内心深刻的变化啊！
    总路线解放了农民的思想，促成了小麦的大丰收；而小麦大丰收又进一步使农民掌握了总路线，思想大大解放，以夏促秋，乘胜猛进。“七一”前夕，全省举行广播动员大会，发起增产秋粮总进军。各县争先恐后，信心百倍，勇往直前。从我们到过的地方看，每个县毫无例外地都有为数不少的双千斤乡、五千斤社、万斤生产队，至于万斤以上的试验田，更是举不胜举。人们对试验田兴趣真高，什么都想试验：清徐仁义村有一棵要结一千一百斤的葡萄大王，刘庄村有亩产二万斤的玉米，太谷贯家堡有亩产十万斤的山药旦，水秀村有亩产二十万斤的糖萝葡，榆次鸣谦有亩产万斤籽棉的棉花，张庆村有亩产三万斤的谷子和高粱……你不信吗？那些试验者就会拉着你到地里去辩论，详细地给你计算一亩共有多少苗，每苗至少可以产多少；他们已经采取了些什么措施，正在继续采取什么措施，使你不能不为他们的热情所感染，为他们的干劲所折服，而和他们一样深信不疑了。
    千方百计搞水肥
    当然，尽管今年秋禾长得空前的好，实现千斤县仍然要经过极其艰巨的斗争。但是思想解放了的农民们，并不畏惧任何困难和斗争，也不吝惜自己的心血和力气。实现千斤县最重要的是水和肥，他们就千方百计地搞水搞肥。5月下旬晋中各县在河北徐水开了一次水利建设现场会议，学习徐水的共产主义风格，在紧张的农忙季节，抽出40％至60％的劳动力搞水利建设。6月1日到20日，二十天功夫，十个县共建成水库一千零九十个，可蓄水二亿一千三百二十万方，平均每天就有五十四个半水库问世。
    肥料，曾经是个难题。各县跃进措施中都有一条：“亩施追肥三至四万斤。”这么多肥从那里来，又怎么上到地里去呢？靠杂肥不行，就把杂肥加工变成人造尿，质量又高又不愁施不进去。最近各县都在大闹人造尿，平遥净化乡一夜埋了两千个大瓮，东泉乡知道了，第二天来了个突击，埋下了一万个。这一期肥出瓮，每亩秋田就可以平均到三百多担。清徐县创造了用卤水制土化肥的经验，解决肥料问题更有办法了。不到两个月，造土化肥的经验在整个晋中盆地普遍开花结果了。
    搞水，需要人；搞肥，也需要人；锄草薅苗加强田间管理，更需要人。劳力不足怎么办呢？干，把一切半辅劳力都发动起来干；他们不但舍得力气，多干苦干，而且开动脑筋，改革工具，让一个人顶几十个人干。汾阳县三天实现了车子化，可节约劳力一百万个。为了解决提水和深锄的问题，又制成了煤气机和锄草机。锄草机一天可锄地二十五亩，比人锄提高效率十倍还多。各县都在大闹技术革命，各行各业都行动起来了，真是“千条心、万条心、一心为了亩产一千斤。”
     生活、劳动军事化
    人们冲天的干劲，最突出的表现是军事化。清徐县所有男女劳力，都按军队建制，编成了班、排、连、营。早上起床号一吹，一排排整齐的队伍立即开赴“战场”。有些五十岁的老大娘，也是肩扛农具，腰挂茶缸，拿着蝇拍，全副“武装”。工地上、田野里，到处开展着轰轰烈烈的红黑旗竞赛。清徐如此，其他各县也莫不如此。现在农民们开始有了强烈的时间观念了。不久以前，平遥县开过一次庆祝小麦丰收和秋粮跃进誓师大会，全县干部、党、团员积极分子一万多人，最远的离城八十多里，规定早晨九点钟开会，八点半便都到齐了。为了实现千斤县，一天、一小时农民都不肯轻轻放过啊！
