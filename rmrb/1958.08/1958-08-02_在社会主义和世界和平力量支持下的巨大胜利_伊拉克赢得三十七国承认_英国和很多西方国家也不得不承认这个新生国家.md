    A Great Victory Supported by Socialist and World Peace Forces
    Iraq Wins Recognition from Thirty-Seven Countries
    Britain and Many Western Countries Have No Choice But to Recognize the New Nation
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) Since the victory of the Iraqi revolution and the establishment of the Iraqi Republic, in the short period of more than half a month up to August 1, this newly born republic has already won recognition from thirty-seven sovereign states, representing two-thirds of the world's total population. This is a great victory for the Iraqi people and a serious defeat for imperialism's hostility towards the national independence movement in the Middle East.
    Revolutionary Iraq was first recognized by the United Arab Republic, the Soviet Union, China, Yemen, and other countries. Asian and African national independent countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia also successively recognized Iraq.
    The Western countries, headed by US and British imperialists, expressed great anger and hatred towards the Iraqi revolution. They attempted to strangle the newly born Iraqi Republic through armed intervention. After the victory of the Iraqi revolution, Lloyd immediately went to the United States for "urgent talks" with Dulles, and according to the Associated Press, the important content of this meeting was to plan "how to deal with" the Iraqi revolutionary regime. Subsequently, US and British invading forces successively occupied Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to launch an armed invasion of the Iraqi Republic.
    However, the imperialists' plans failed. The newly born Iraqi Republic won the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, and the revolutionary regime quickly controlled the situation. The recognition of the Soviet Union, China, the United Arab Republic and many other countries, as well as the support of the people of the world, greatly enhanced the international status of the Iraqi Republic. The conspiracy of US and British imperialism to expand the war of aggression was frustrated. Under these circumstances, Western countries had to reconsider their policies towards Iraq. Washington diplomatic officials also admitted that it was becoming increasingly difficult for Western countries to refuse to recognize this government. On July 30, after the Baghdad Pact Council meeting in London, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan also announced their recognition of Iraq. West Germany, Japan, and Italy also successively recognized the Iraqi Republic on the 30th and 31st. On August 1, Britain reluctantly announced its recognition of the Iraqi Republic. According to United Press International, the United States will eventually have to recognize Iraq. This shows that the imperialists' plan to extinguish the Iraqi Republic by force has failed, and they have had to change their strategy.
    However, it must be pointed out that the recognition of Iraq by these Western countries does not mean that they have abandoned their policy of hostility towards the Iraqi revolution. Currently, the US and Britain are still increasing their troops in the Middle East, and Turkey is also stationing troops on the Iraqi border. While maintaining military threats, the new strategy adopted by Western countries towards Iraq aims to intensify political conspiracies, attempting to achieve their colonialist goals through deceptive means of winning over and wooing. The Iraqi government has stated that its foreign policy aims to maintain world peace and strengthen friendly cooperation between countries. If imperialism continues to carry out conspiracies to harm the Iraqi Republic, it will absolutely not succeed.
    The thirty-seven countries that have successively recognized the Iraqi Republic are: United Arab Republic, Soviet Union, China, Yemen, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Vietnam, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, East Germany, Mongolia, Indonesia, Sudan, Tunisia, India, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Morocco, Burma, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, West Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Ethiopia, Malaya, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st: TASS News Agency reported from Moscow on August 1st: A reporter from the Soviet "Pravda" wrote when describing Iraq that although the republic is still very young, the government has already begun to solve some national problems. After the promulgation of the provisional constitution, the government passed a decree abolishing tribal courts. This decree not only has anti-feudal tendencies but also concentrates judicial power and separates it from executive power.
    The dispatch went on to write that the Department of Social Affairs is formulating various measures to solve unemployment in the country and improve the living standards of urban and rural residents. In the near future, the distribution of wasteland to landless farmers will begin.
    Economic Minister Kuba described the national economic situation and economic development prospects to a "Pravda" reporter. The main problem facing Iraq in the economic field is national industrialization.
    The "Pravda" reporter emphasized the stability of the situation in Iraq. He said that this is primarily the result of the whole nation supporting the republic's government. The dispatch said that there has never been such a popular government in Iraqi history. Anyone who comes here, even for a few days, can see this with their own eyes.

### 在社会主义和世界和平力量支持下的巨大胜利  伊拉克赢得三十七国承认  英国和很多西方国家也不得不承认这个新生国家

    在社会主义和世界和平力量支持下的巨大胜利
    伊拉克赢得三十七国承认
    英国和很多西方国家也不得不承认这个新生国家
    本报讯　自从伊拉克革命胜利和伊拉克共和国成立以来，在截至8月1日止的短短半个多月内，这个新生的共和国已经获得了占世界总人口三分之二的三十七个主权国家的承认。这是伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，也是帝国主义敌视中东民族独立运动的严重失败。
    革命的伊拉克首先受到阿联、苏联、中国、也门等国的承认。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等亚非民族独立国家也先后承认了伊拉克。
    以美、英帝国主义者为首的西方国家，对于伊拉克的革命表示了极大的恼怒与仇恨，它们企图用武装干涉来扼杀新生的伊拉克共和国。伊拉克革命胜利后，劳埃德立即到美国同杜勒斯进行了“紧急会谈”，而据美联社报道，这次会谈的重要内容便是策划“怎么对付”伊拉克革命政权。接着，美英侵略军先后侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦，企图进一步向伊拉克共和国发动武装侵略。
    但是，帝国主义者的打算落空了。新生的伊拉克共和国获得了全国人民的热烈支持，革命政权迅速地控制了局势。苏联、中国和阿拉伯联合共和国等许多国家的承认以及全世界人民的支持，大大地提高了伊拉克共和国的国际地位。而美英帝国主义企图扩大侵略战争的阴谋遭到了挫折。在这种情况下，西方国家不得不重新考虑它们对伊拉克的政策。华盛顿外交官员也承认，西方国家想不承认这个政府已经越来越困难了。7月30日，在伦敦开完了巴格达条约理事会会议以后，土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦也宣布承认伊拉克。西德、日本和意大利等国在30日和31日先后也承认了伊拉克共和国。8月1日，英国也无可奈何地宣布承认了伊拉克共和国。据合众国际社报道，美国最终也将不得不承认伊拉克。这表明，帝国主义妄想武装扑灭伊拉克共和国的计划已经失败，因而不得不改变策略。
    但是，必须指出，这些西方国家对伊拉克的承认，绝不表明它们已经放弃了敌视伊拉克革命的政策。目前，美英仍在中东增兵，土耳其也陈兵伊拉克边境。在保持军事威胁的情况下，西方国家对伊拉克采取的新策略，其目的在于加紧政治阴谋，企图用欺骗拉拢的手段，来达到殖民主义的目的。伊拉克政府已经表明，它的外交政策是旨在维护世界和平和加强各国友好合作的。帝国主义如果仍要进行损害伊拉克共和国的阴谋活动，那是绝对不能得逞的。
    先后承认伊拉克共和国的三十七个国家是：阿拉伯联合共和国、苏联、中国、也门、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫、朝鲜、越南、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、民主德国、蒙古、印度尼西亚、苏丹、突尼斯、印度、沙特阿拉伯、阿富汗、锡兰、摩洛哥、缅甸、巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其、西德、希腊、意大利、日本、埃塞俄比亚、马来亚、奥地利、比利时、英国、加拿大。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：苏联“真理报”记者在描述伊拉克时写道，这个共和国虽然还很年青，但是政府已经开始解决一些民族问题。临时宪法公布以后，政府通过了取消部落法庭的法令。这个法令不仅具有反封建的倾向，而且还集中了司法权，使它同执行权分开。
    这篇通讯接着写道，社会事务部正在拟定各项措施，以便解决国内的失业现象和提高城乡居民的生活水平。在最近一个时期内，将开始把荒地分配给无地农民。
    经济部长库巴向“真理报”记者描述了国家经济状况和经济发展前景。伊拉克在经济方面面临的主要问题是国家工业化。
    “真理报”记者着重指出了伊拉克局势的稳定。他说，这首先是全民支持共和国政府的结果。这篇通讯说，伊拉克历史上还没有过这样一个得人心的政府。这一切是来到这里即便是几天的任何一个人都亲眼看得到的。
