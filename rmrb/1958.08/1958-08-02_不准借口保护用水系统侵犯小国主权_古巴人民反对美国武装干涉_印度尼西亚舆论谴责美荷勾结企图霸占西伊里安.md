Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from New York via TASS: The United States intends to send troops to Cuba under the pretext of protecting its pumping station and water pipes at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba. This decision by the U.S. government has aroused protests from the Cuban public, who believe that this measure by the United States is an interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

According to a report from Havana by "New York Times" reporter Phillips, Cuban rebel leader Castro also protested against the entry of U.S. troops into Cuban territory. Castro delivered a radio speech saying that this measure by the U.S. government "is an open violation of Cuban sovereignty." The "National Revolutionary Front," recently established in Caracas by the Cuban opposition, also opposes the entry of U.S. troops into Cuban territory.

Dr. Llerena, a representative of the Cuban rebels in the United States, issued a statement saying, "The intervention of U.S. armed forces in Cuban territory is a very serious matter. No matter what excuses are put forward, this intervention is an unreasonable infringement on Cuban sovereignty." He pointed out that the United States is colluding with the enemies of the Cuban people. The Cuban people and the free people of the Western Hemisphere must oppose this.

The "Washington Post and Times Herald," commenting on the decision to send U.S. sailors to Cuban territorial waters, emphasized that the United States is attempting to replace the Cuban troops at the former port near the Guantanamo Naval Base. The newspaper said, "This is taking a dubious political risk."

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from New York via TASS: The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement condemning the U.S. government's decision to send troops to Cuba under the pretext of protecting the water system for the U.S. troops stationed at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba. The statement believes that this is an interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

The statement pointed out, "Every American will be shocked by the landing of U.S. Marines in Cuba. A frivolous statement issued by the (U.S. government) on July 28 regarding this intervention by the U.S. military contains something sinister and terrifying."

The statement emphasized: "This act of armed aggression by the United States is unjustified. It is an infringement on the sovereignty of another country. It is an intervention in the Cuban democratic forces fighting to overthrow the Batista dictatorship. This action exposes the Eisenhower government's attitude towards small countries: ignoring their sovereignty and treating these countries as dependencies subject to the will of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, it is also a contempt for the will of the American people."

The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the United States finally demanded the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Cuba, demanded the abolition of the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, and called on the American people to demand an end to military and economic aid to the Cuban dictator Batista.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 1st: Today, Jakarta newspapers are calling on the people to pay close attention to a statement made a few days ago by the Dutch Minister of Defense, Staf, in response to a question from a member of the Dutch parliament, in which he said that the Dutch occupation forces in West Irian already possess rockets and modern equipment.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" said that the Dutch military industry is not yet capable of manufacturing rocket weapons. Therefore, the only possibility is that the United States and the Netherlands are colluding to strengthen the equipment of the Dutch occupation forces. The newspaper revealed that the United States and the Netherlands are attempting to implement collective colonial rule in West Irian.

The "People's Daily" called on the people to strengthen their support for the people of the Middle East in their struggle against the U.S. and British imperialist aggression, and at the same time, to be more vigilant and to take more united and stronger actions to oppose the conspiracies of U.S. and Dutch imperialism.

"Dongxing Daily" said that the Dutch military occupation of West Irian and its war preparations actually constitute colonialist military aggression. The newspaper quoted Indonesian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Suwito as saying that if the situation in West Irian develops into military action, then the Netherlands must bear full responsibility.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Manila News: According to the "Manila Chronicle" on July 31, the Director of the Bureau of Internal Revenue for Central Luzon, Velasco, said in Pampanga province on the 30th that the smuggling of U.S. military goods has caused the Philippines to lose huge amounts of tax revenue.

Velasco pointed out that the U.S. Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base in the Philippines are sources of smuggled and tax-evaded U.S. goods. He advocated establishing checkpoints around the aforementioned U.S. military bases to stop these "smuggling activities."

The "Manila Chronicle" reported on the 21st that Clark U.S. Air Base sells an average of $75,000 worth of "surplus materials" every week. These untaxed materials flow in large quantities into Manila and other cities in the Philippines. In these cities, 35,000 jeeps, which have been modified to operate as passenger transport vehicles, are so-called "surplus materials" sold at U.S. military bases in the Philippines.

The "Manila Chronicle" stated in its editorial on the 30th that the black market for selling U.S. military supplies has become a major loophole that damages Philippine tax revenue. The editorial called for stopping this black market trade that harms the Philippine national economy, and demanded that the U.S. military and diplomatic authorities be responsible for preventing items that have not been taxed in the Philippines from flowing into the Philippine market from U.S. military bases or elsewhere.

    不准借口保护用水系统侵犯小国主权
    古巴人民反对美国武装干涉
    印度尼西亚舆论谴责美荷勾结企图霸占西伊里安
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国打算借口保卫它在古巴的海军基地关塔那摩的抽水站和输水管而派遣军队到古巴去。美国政府这个决定引起了古巴公众的抗议，他们认为美国这一措施是干涉古巴的内政。
    据“纽约时报”记者菲利浦斯从哈瓦那报道，古巴起义者的领袖卡斯特罗也表示抗议美国军队开进古巴领土。卡斯特罗发表广播演说说，美国政府这种措施“是公开破坏古巴的主权”。不久前由古巴反对派在加拉加斯成立的“全国革命阵线”也反对美国军队开进古巴领土。
    在美国的古巴起义者代表列雷纳博士发表声明说，“美国武装部队对古巴领土的干涉是一件十分严重的事情。无论提出怎样的借口，这种干涉总归是无理侵犯古巴主权。”他指出，美国同古巴人民的敌人狼狈为奸。古巴人民和西半球的自由人民都要反对这一点。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在评论派美国水兵到古巴领海这一决定时着重指出，美国企图取代关塔那摩海军基地附近的前港的古巴军队的地位，报纸说，“这是采取了令人怀疑的政治冒险”。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：美国共产党执行委员会发表声明，谴责美国政府借口保护美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地驻军的用水系统而决定派军队到古巴去，声明认为这是干涉古巴的内政。
    声明指出，“每一个美国人都会为美国海军陆战队在古巴登陆感到震惊。（美国政府）在7月28日就美军这种干涉行动发表的一项轻率声明包含着某种凶恶可怕的东西。”
    声明强调指出：“美国这种武装侵略行为是没有道理的。这是对别国主权的侵犯。是对争取推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的古巴民主力量的干涉。这种行动暴露了艾森豪威尔政府对小国的态度：无视它们的主权，把这些国家看成附属国和受美国帝国主义意志支配的国家。同时这也是对美国人民意志的蔑视。”
    美国共产党执行委员会最后要求立即从古巴撤退一切美国军队，要求取消美国在关塔那摩的海军基地，并且呼吁美国人民要求停止对古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔的军事和经济援助。
    新华社雅加达1日电　今天雅加达的报纸唤起人民密切注意荷兰国防大臣斯塔夫数日前在荷兰议会回答议员时所说的一段话，他说，西伊里安荷兰占领军已经拥有火箭和现代化装备。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说，荷兰军事工业还不能够制造火箭武器，因此，唯一的可能就是，美国和荷兰勾结在一起来加强荷兰占领军的装备。这家报纸揭露，美国和荷兰企图在西伊里安实行集体的殖民统治。
    “人民日报”号召人民在加强支持中东各国人民反对美英帝国主义侵略的斗争的同时，还必须提高警惕，并且要用更加团结和更加有力的行动来反对美国和荷兰帝国主义的阴谋。
    “东星报”说，荷兰对西伊里安的军事占领和它的备战活动实际上已经构成殖民主义军事侵略。这家报纸援引印度尼西亚外交部秘书长苏维托的话说，如果西伊里安的局势发展成为军事行动的话，那末，荷兰就必须承担全部的责任。
    新华社31日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”7月31日报道，中吕宋区税务局局长维拉斯科30日在邦板牙省说，美国军用物品的走私已经使菲律宾损失巨额税收。
    维拉斯科指出，美国在菲律宾的克拉克空军基地和苏比克海军基地是走私漏税的美国货的来源。他主张在上述美国军事基地周围设立检查站，来阻止这些“走私活动”。
      “马尼拉纪事报”在21日曾经报道，克拉克美国空军基地平均每个星期出售七万五千美元的“剩余物资”。这些没有纳税的物资大量地流入马尼拉和菲律宾的其他城市。在这些城市里，有三万五千辆经过改装后经营客运业务的吉普车就是在菲律宾的美国军事基地出售的所谓“剩余物资”。
    “马尼拉纪事报”在30日的社论中指出，出售美国军用物资的黑市已经成了损害菲律宾税收的大漏洞。社论要求制止这种损害菲律宾国家经济的黑市买卖，并且要求美国的军事当局和外交当局负责防止这种没有向菲律宾纳税的物品从美国军事基地或其他地方流入菲律宾市场。
