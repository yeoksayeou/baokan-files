According to Zhejiang Daily news: Use rectification methods to educate cadres and the masses not to be discouraged in times of difficulty; also use rectification methods to educate cadres and the masses not to be arrogant in times of victory, so that they can always be full of energy and continuously leap forward. This is the basic experience of the Pingyang County Committee of Zhejiang Province in carrying out political and ideological work during the Great Leap Forward.

Last winter, Pingyang County lost in its agricultural production competition with Huangyan County. At that time, in order to overcome the tendency of discouragement among cadres and the masses and turn negative factors into positive ones, the Pingyang County Committee launched a rectification campaign among cadres and the masses throughout the county, criticizing and overcoming erroneous ideas, boosting revolutionary energy, and setting off a revolutionary competition to learn from Huangyan, catch up with Huangyan, and surpass Huangyan. After a winter and spring of hard work by the people of the county, the backward situation was reversed, and a bumper harvest of spring flowers and early rice was achieved.

However, after achieving remarkable results in production, two different situations emerged among the cadres. The vast majority of cadres, inspired by the bumper harvest, rode the waves and continued to move forward. In the areas they led, the masses were full of enthusiasm and soaring energy, and they were full of confidence in achieving increased production targets. For example, Lingxi District, on the basis of a bumper harvest of early rice, set an advanced target of doubling the yield of late rice and decided to carry out large-scale experimental fields, trying to plant 10,000 mu of 10,000-jin rice. However, there were also some cadres who, in the face of the new situation, could not see the direction of progress. On the contrary, they believed that they had worked hard for more than half a year and were already very good, and they should sit down and rest. For work, they would take a step and then watch a step. They would be complacent with a little achievement, and even complain that the task was heavy and the work was endless. When some people saw good things from others, they did not adopt a humble attitude of learning and catching up, but only looked for the shortcomings of others to comfort themselves with the shortcomings of others. Some cadres in Wanquan District went to other places for visits and inspections, and they would pull back the worst-growing rice seedlings and compare them with their own. In fact, they were deceiving themselves and willingly lagging behind. Therefore, in their areas, the party's policies were not implemented resolutely enough, and tasks were often not implemented. The masses in Lingxi Township criticized the cadres, saying: "The output is doubled, but the enthusiasm is halved."

In light of the new situation that emerged after the victory, the county party committee decided to conduct rectification among the cadres in a timely manner. Therefore, a three-level cadre meeting was convened. While continuing to implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Three-Level Cadre Meeting, the ideology and work style of the cadres were rectified in accordance with the requirements of the General Line. Through on-site visits, the experience of the early rice harvest was summarized, advanced examples were vigorously promoted, and advanced examples were commended. The rectification method was used to carry out great airing of views, great debates, discover new contradictions, and establish opposing viewpoints to start debates.

At the meeting, a group of outstanding cadres who were full of fighting spirit, vigorous, and dared to think, speak, and act were first commended. These cadres were able to reflect the advanced views and aspirations of the masses and understood that carrying out a high-yield movement was the conscious requirement of the broad masses; in their areas, the work has always been vigorous. While commending the advanced, the situation was further analyzed, and a new task of "late rice exceeding early rice, doubling the yield" was proposed based on the specific conditions of the county. This made the originally advanced areas even more confident and full of energy, and made the backward areas feel a certain amount of pressure and had a desire to try.

After the meeting clarified the direction of struggle, the masses consciously checked their work and their thoughts from the bottom up, carried out great airing of views, great debates, and great contention, adopted the method of presenting facts and reasoning, and carried out sharp criticism of conservatism and backwardness. For example, the work in Mazhan District was relatively backward. The county party committee announced the progress of summer production in each district and organized district and township cadres to visit. After the township cadres in Mazhan District saw this, they conducted a great debate, sharply exposing the right-leaning, fear-of-difficulty, and stagnant thinking of the district committee leadership, which did not work hard and practically, giving the district committee leadership a great shock and consciously making a check. The masses reflected: The more such meetings are held, the more energetic they become. Another example is Yishan District, which was an 800-jin district last year. The natural conditions are very superior. The district committee leadership believed that relying solely on natural conditions could surpass other districts. They were proud and complacent. As a result, since last winter, all the work has been lagging behind other districts. At this meeting, Aojiang District seriously criticized Yishan District for its lack of energy and slow change in work style. Through great airing of views, great debates, and great contention, the cadres of Yishan District consciously stood up to criticize the proud and complacent mood of the district committee leadership and the past self-willed lagging thinking of not resolutely pulling out the white flag and inserting the red flag. After listening to the criticism, the Yishan District Committee was greatly shocked and immediately held an emergency meeting of the District Committee in the middle of the conference to discuss everyone's criticism and check the past ideological work style, expressing its determination to boost its energy and catch up. During the break, they also held a meeting of all district and township cadres, and the district committee made a check. After full deliberation, they unanimously agreed to propose a friendly competition to Aojiang District.

While the thinking of the upper and lower levels basically reached consensus and the enthusiasm of the masses was high, the leadership carried out comparisons in all directions and vigorously grasped the opposing viewpoints, looking for reasons and digging for roots in the comparisons. For example, the cadres of Wanquan District have always been burdened by the backward baggage of having more land, less labor, and less cattle in their district, believing that they are restricted by objective conditions, and they cannot leap forward, and they cannot keep up with others. Through comparison with the advanced Lingxi District, it was found that the water conservancy, soil quality, and production base were not worse than Lingxi. Even within this district, many opposing viewpoints between advanced and backward can be found. In the same Songbu Township, the early rice yield per mu in Xiankou Cooperative, where the soil quality is the worst, can reach 1,400 jin, while Linzhai Cooperative, where the soil quality is the best, is only 500 or 600 jin. It can be seen that the problem is not the lack of labor or the poor soil quality, but the breaking of superstitions, the liberation of thinking, and the full play of subjective initiative.

After four days and four nights of debate, the conference effectively rectified the ideology and work style of the cadres, further broke superstitions, liberated thinking, and promoted a revolutionary style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Everyone reflected: The horizons have been broadened, and the minds have been cleared. Based on the specific conditions, each district and township generally revised the original production increase targets, and a friendly competition between districts and districts, townships and townships was launched at the meeting, to see who would be the best in late rice production.

　　有困难不气馁　有成绩不骄傲
    整风药一到  思想百病消
    中共平阳县委在大跃进中政治思想工作的基本经验
    据浙江日报消息：在困难的时候，用整风的办法，教育干部和群众不要气馁；在胜利的时候，也用整风的办法，教育干部和群众不要骄傲，这样才能经常鼓足干劲，不断跃进。这是浙江省平阳县委在大跃进中进行政治思想工作的基本经验。
    去年冬天，平阳县在同黄岩县农业生产竞赛中比输了。当时，平阳县委为了克服干部和群众中气馁的倾向，变消极因素为积极因素，在全县干部和群众中开展了整风，批判与克服了错误思想，鼓足革命干劲，掀起了学黄岩、赶黄岩、超黄岩的革命竞赛。经过全县人民一冬一春的苦战，扭转了落后局面，取得了春花和早稻的丰收。
    但是，在生产上取得显著成绩后，在干部中却出现了两种不同的情况。绝大多数干部在丰收的鼓舞下，乘风破浪，继续前进。在他们领导的地区，群众情绪饱满，干劲冲天，对实现增产指标信心百倍。如灵溪区，在早稻大丰收的基础上，订出晚稻产量翻二番的先进指标，并决定大搞试验田，试种万斤稻一万亩。但是，也有一部分干部，在新形势面前看不到前进的方向，相反地认为自己苦干了大半年已经很不差，应该坐下来休息一下了。对工作，他们是走一段看一段，稍有成绩就沾沾自喜，甚至埋怨任务重，工作无边。有的人看到人家好的东西时，不是采取虚心学习、迎头赶上的态度，而是光找人家的缺点，以别人的缺点来安慰自己。万全区有的干部到别地去参观检查时，就把人家生长最不好的稻苗拔回来和自己的对比，实际上是自欺欺人，自甘落后。因此，在他们那里，执行党的方针政策不够坚决，任务往往贯彻不下去。灵溪镇群众批评干部说：“产量翻一番，干劲减一半”。
    根据胜利后出现的新情况，县委决定及时在干部中进行整风。于是，召开了三级干部大会。在继续贯彻中共八大二次会议和全省三级干部会议精神的同时，以总路线的要求为标准，整顿了干部的思想作风，通过现场参观，总结早稻丰收经验，大抓先进，表扬先进，用整风办法开展大鸣大放，发现新的矛盾，树立对立面展开辩论。
    会上，首先表扬了一批斗志昂扬、生气勃勃、敢想敢说敢做的优秀干部。这些干部能够反映群众中先进的看法和愿望，懂得开展高额丰产运动是广大群众自觉的要求；在他们那里，工作一直是朝气蓬勃的。在表扬先进的同时，又进一步分析了形势，根据本县具体条件，提出“晚稻超早稻，产量翻一番”的新任务。这就使得原来先进的地区更加信心百倍，干劲十足；使后进地区在无形中感到一定的压力，有了跃跃欲试的愿望。
    会议在明确奋斗方向以后，群众就自觉地从下而上检查工作，检查思想，开展大鸣大放大争大辩，采取摆事实，讲道理，对保守落后开展尖锐的批评。例如马站区的工作比较落后。县委把各区夏季生产行动进度公布，组织区乡干部参观。马站区的乡干部看了以后进行大辩论，尖锐地揭露了区委领导上不苦干实干，强调客观困难的右倾畏难、裹足不前的不良思想作风，给区委领导以很大的震动，自觉地作了检查。群众反映：这样的会越开越有劲。又如宜山区去年是八百斤区，自然条件很优越，区委领导上认为光靠自然条件就可胜过其他各区，骄傲自满，结果，自去冬以来各项工作反而一直落在其他区后面。在这次会上，敖江区严肃地批评了宜山区的干劲不足，作风转变不快。宜山区的干部通过大放大鸣大争大辩，自觉地起来批评区委领导上的这种骄傲自满情绪和过去不坚决拔白旗、插红旗的自甘落后思想，宜山区委听了批评后震动很大，在大会中途立即召开区委紧急会议，讨论大家的批评，检查过去的思想作风，表示决心鼓足干劲，迎头赶上。在休息时，他们又召开全体区乡干部会议，区委作了检查。经过充分酝酿后，一致同意向敖江区提出开展友谊竞赛。
    在上下思想基本上取得一致，群众情绪高涨的同时，领导上就四面八方大搞对比，大抓对立面，在对比中找原因、挖根源。例如，万全区的干部历来就背着本区土地多、劳力少、耕牛少的落后包袱，认为受客观条件限制，就是不能大跃进，就是跟不上人家。通过与先进的灵溪区的对比，发现水利、土质、生产基础等并不比灵溪差。就是在本区内也可找到很多先进与落后的对立面。同样一个宋埠乡，土质最差的仙口社早稻亩产可达一千四百斤，而土质最好的林宅社却只有五、六百斤。可见问题不在于什么劳力少、土质差，而在于破除迷信，解放思想，充分发挥主观能动作用。
    会议经过四天四夜的辩论，有力地整顿了干部的思想作风，进一步破除了迷信，解放了思想，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的革命风格。大家反映：眼界开朗了，头脑清醒了。各区乡根据具体条件普遍修订了原来的增产指标，并在会议上掀起了区与区、乡与乡的友谊竞赛，要在晚稻生产上见一见高低。
