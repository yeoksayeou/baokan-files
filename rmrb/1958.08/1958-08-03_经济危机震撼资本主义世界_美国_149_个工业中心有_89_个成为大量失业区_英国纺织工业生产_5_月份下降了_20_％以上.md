Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Capitalist countries are experiencing a general decline in foreign trade. According to a statistical report published on the 29th by the Industrial Research Institute in Cologne, West Germany, compared to the first quarter of 1957, imports by capitalist countries decreased by 6.5% and exports decreased by 7.7% in the first quarter of this year.

The United States, severely hit by the economic crisis, experienced the largest reduction—reaching 19%. Its trade surplus decreased from $7.6 billion to $3.7 billion. Most Western European countries also saw their exports stagnate, while imports fell by nearly 10%.

Even West Germany's foreign trade has begun to shrink. According to the West German "Economist" newspaper, West German commodity exports in May decreased by 6% compared to the same period last year. The magazine also stated that foreign orders to West Germany in the first quarter of this year decreased by 9%.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 31st: U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson said on July 30th that the United States "is now facing an estimated budget deficit of approximately $12 billion," which is the largest budget deficit in the post-war period.

Anderson revealed this figure while testifying at a closed meeting of the House Ways and Means Committee. He supported the government's proposal to increase the debt ceiling from $280 billion to $288 billion. The House Ways and Means Committee later agreed to the government's request.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: Washington dispatch: The U.S. Department of Labor announced on the 29th that three more industrial areas in the United States have been designated as areas "with substantial unemployment" (where the number of unemployed accounts for 5% or 6% or more of the total labor force). These three areas are: Los Angeles-Long Beach, Birmingham, Alabama, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The Labor Department also stated that out of 149 major labor markets in the United States, 89 are now classified as areas of substantial unemployment, and this situation is likely to continue in the coming months.

Xinhua News Agency, London: The British magazine "Labour Research" reported on July 30th: "More than 40% of the residents in Britain are now living with insufficient food." It also stated: "One in every five (British) people is severely lacking in food."

The magazine reached the above conclusion after analyzing the recently published annual report of the British National Food Survey Committee. The magazine also said: This report shows that in many large families, the amount of food consumed by each person has decreased. In families with three or more children, food "appears very obviously lacking."

Xinhua News Agency, London, August 1st: The "Financial Times" published an editorial today stating, "The recession in British industry has reached an extremely acute level in the textile industry."

The newspaper said that in the first five months of this year, woolen fabric production fell by about 14% compared to the same period last year, and cotton fabric production fell by 9%. In May alone, the output of woolen fabrics fell by 25%, and cotton fabrics fell by 19%. The production rate of rayon is now more than 20% lower than the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the production of rayon was 16% lower than the same period last year.

The "Financial Times" believes that the contraction of the domestic market caused by the deepening recession of the entire economy is a contributing factor to the difficulties currently facing the textile industry. Another factor is the fierce competition in foreign markets. The "Financial Times" pointed out that West Germany and Italy are strong competitors.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 2nd: French Prime Minister de Gaulle said in a television broadcast on the evening of August 1st that France may have to face the beginning of an economic recession. He then called on the people of the country to further tighten their belts and for everyone to "contribute a sacrifice" in order to put the country's economy "back on track." De Gaulle unreservedly stated that the government would transfer the heavy burden of "stabilizing" finances onto the working people by freezing wages. He said that there could be no wage increases for employees of public utilities, state agencies, and enterprises.

The day before De Gaulle delivered his speech, the French government had already announced an increase of $100 million in new taxes, mainly involving consumer goods.

In addition, according to the "l'Humanité" newspaper on August 1st, in recent days, more than 3,000 workers have been laid off in many French enterprises producing civil aircraft, motorcycles, and daily necessities.

Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: TASS News Agency, New York, August 1st: The Colombian magazine "Semana" reported that prices and living costs in Colombia are constantly increasing. From 1957 to 1958, workers' wages increased by an average of 10% to 12%, while the prices of major foods rose by 20% to 40%: meat prices rose by 20%, bread prices rose by 35%, and butter prices rose by 36.4%.

The magazine pointed out that one of the reasons for this situation is the excessive amount of unproductive military spending. According to the 1958 budget, Colombia's military expenditure almost reached 270 million pesos. Military spending is equivalent to the total expenditure on education, healthcare, agriculture, courts, prosecutors, and public works.

    经济危机震撼资本主义世界
    美国149个工业中心有89个成为大量失业区
    英国纺织工业生产5月份下降了20％以上
    新华社讯　资本主义国家的对外贸易普遍减少。据西德科隆的工业研究所在29日发表的一项统计报告说，同1957年第一季度比较，今年第一季度资本主义国家的进口减少了6.5％，出口减少了7.7％。
    受到经济危机严重打击的美国减少得最多——达到19％。它的出超由七十六亿美元减少到三十七亿美元。西欧大多数国家出口也陷于停滞，而进口则下降了将近10％。
    就是西德，它的对外贸易也开始缩减。据西德“经济学家报”报道，今年5月，西德商品的出口量比去年同期减少了6％。据杂志统计，在今年第一季度外国向西德的定货量减少了9％。
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部长安德逊7月30日说，美国“现在正面临估计大约为一百二十亿美元的预算赤字”，也就是战后时期最大的预算赤字。
    安德逊是在众议院筹款委员会的一次秘密会议上作证时透露上述数字的。他支持政府提出的关于把国债的最高限额从二千八百亿美元增加到二千八百八十亿美元。众议院筹款委员会后来同意了政府的要求。
    新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国劳工部29日宣布，美国最近又有三个工业地区被列为“存在大量失业现象”的地区（失业人数占劳动力总数5％或6％以上），这三个地区是：洛杉矶—长滩、亚拉巴马州的伯明翰和威斯康星州的密尔窝基。
    劳工部还说，在美国一百四十九个大劳工市场当中，现在已有八十九个列入大量失业区，这种情况大概会在今后几个月内继续下去。
    新华社伦敦电　英国“劳工研究”杂志7月30日报道说：“英国现在有40％以上的居民在食物不足的情况下过活。”它又说：“每五个（英国）人中，就有一个人严重地缺乏食物。”
    这家杂志在分析了英国全国食物调查委员会最近发表的年度报告以后，得出上述结论。杂志还说：这个报告表明，在许多大家庭里，每个人的食物消费量都减少了。在那些有三个或者更多的孩子的家庭中，食物“显得十分明显的缺乏。”
    据新华社伦敦1日电　“金融时报”今天发表社论说，“英国工业的衰退在纺织业方面已经到达非常尖锐的程度。”
    这家报纸说，在今年头五个月中，毛织品生产比去年同期下降了大约14％，棉织品生产下降了9％。仅仅在5月份，毛织品的产量就下降了25％、棉织品下降了19％。人造纤维的生产率现在比去年同期低了20％以上，今年上半年，人造纤维的生产量比去年同一时期低16％。
    “金融时报”认为，由于整个经济日益加深的衰退而引起的国内市场收缩是纺织工业目前面临着的困难的一个形成因素，另外一个因素是国外市场上的剧烈竞争。“金融时报”指出，西德和意大利都是强有力的竞争者。
    新华社2日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理戴高乐1日晚上在电视广播演说中说，法国可能将不得不面临经济衰退的开始。他接着便要求全国人民进一步勒紧裤带，每个人都“供献一份牺牲”，以便把国家的经济“纳入轨道”。戴高乐毫不掩饰地表示，政府将通过冻结工资的办法把“稳定”财政的沉重负担转嫁到劳动人民头上去。他说，公用事业、国家机关和企业的职工的工资不可能有任何提高。
    在戴高乐发表演讲的前一天，法国政府已经宣布增加相当于一亿美元的新赋税，增税项目主要涉及消费性商品。
    另外，据“人道报”1日报道，最近几天来，在法国许多生产民航飞机、摩托车和日用品的企业中，分别解雇了三千多工人。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：哥伦比亚“一周”杂志报道，哥伦比亚物价和生活费用不断增长。从1957年到1958年这一期间，工人工资平均增长了10％到12％，而主要食品的价格却上涨了20％到40％：肉价上涨了20％，面包价格上涨了35％，黄油价格上涨了36.4％。
    杂志指出，造成这种情况的原因之一是非生产性的军事开支过于庞大。根据1958年的预算，哥伦比亚的军费开支，几乎达到二亿七千万比索。军备费用相当于教育、医疗、农业、法院、检察机关、公共工程等项开支的总和。
