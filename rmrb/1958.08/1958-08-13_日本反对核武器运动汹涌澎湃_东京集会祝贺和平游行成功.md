Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The "Central Rally for Preventing Nuclear Armament of Japan and Supporting Democracy" was grandly held at Hibiya Park in Tokyo on the evening of the 11th.

　　The one-thousand-kilometer peace march contingent, which had just arrived in Tokyo, sang the song "No Atomic Bombs" and entered the venue in a mighty manner, participating in the rally.

　　Ikuo Yasui, Sanzo Nosaka, Kenji Miyamoto, Ryoichi Oyama, Yoshitaro Hirano, representatives from the Soviet Union, Canada, and other countries participating in the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, as well as nearly 10,000 workers, students, women, and children from Tokyo, greeted and joined the peace march contingent before entering the venue together.

　　Next, the bicycle teams participating in the peace relay race from Nagasaki and Aomori, respectively, and heading towards Tokyo, also arrived at the venue. Consequently, the rally, attended by 15,000 people, was declared open.

　　Reverend Atsushi Nishimoto, amidst enthusiastic applause, took the stage to address the audience on behalf of the march contingent. He stated that although the peace march contingent had completed the one-thousand-kilometer journey in one go, they did not feel tired at all. This was due to the encouragement from the people across Japan who longed to prohibit nuclear weapons. Nishimoto specifically pointed out that people of different thoughts and beliefs participated in the march under the common goal of opposing nuclear weapons.

　　Finally, Nishimoto wished the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament a success.

　　Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, then delivered a speech. He warmly welcomed the arrival of the march contingent and pointed out that this grand march was a prelude to the World Conference aimed at bringing about peace through action.

　　Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, and Rigby, the Australian representative participating in the World Conference, also delivered speeches at the rally. They unanimously congratulated the success of the one-thousand-kilometer peace march and hoped that the participants would work hard for the success of the World Conference.

　　The rally passed a resolution demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government: enact laws prohibiting nuclear armament, state that the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" will not be nuclear armed, and prohibit the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan; issue a declaration prohibiting nuclear armament of Japan, and negotiate with governments of various countries to establish nuclear-free zones; oppose the US and British military intervention in the Middle East; demand that the United States withdraw its atomic bases to ensure the security of Asia; enact a law to aid atomic bomb victims; cease implementing policies that suppress the Japanese people, respect the spirit of the Japanese Constitution, and make Japan a peaceful country.

　　The rally passed another resolution demanding that the US and British governments follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately cease nuclear weapons testing; demanding that countries possessing nuclear weapons conduct negotiations to prevent the expansion of nuclear armament and comprehensively prohibit the storage, manufacture, and movement of nuclear weapons. The resolution also put forward the following demands: stop all war preparations and open the way for general disarmament; the US and Britain immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan; the United States should not transport nuclear weapons into Japan and should remove its atomic bases in Japan.

　　The rally passed a declaration, strongly appealing to the world: compel the US and Britain to immediately and unconditionally cease nuclear weapons testing, following the example of the Soviet Union; compel the US and Britain to immediately withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East; demand the convening of a summit meeting of heads of government to discuss issues such as the prohibition of nuclear weapons and peaceful coexistence.

　　The declaration emphasized that in order to achieve these goals, it is imperative to ensure the success of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which begins on the 12th.
