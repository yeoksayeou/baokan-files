　　If You Think You Can, You Can
    People say: Recently, the Livestock Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has had many whimsical ideas in the technical revolution. Calling them whimsical is not an exaggeration at all.
    As the saying goes, "a toad wants to eat swan meat," meaning that there is no hope of eating swan meat. However, the comrades in the wild animal breeding department of this company are determined to let everyone eat swan meat. They are preparing to cultivate swans into domestic fowl. Now, they have already captured three swans in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, and have also collected more than twenty swan eggs. Soon, they will be able to hatch cygnets using artificial incubation methods.
    Foxes originally belong to the "carnivorous" category of animals, but they thought: "Dogs can change from carnivorous to omnivorous, so why can't foxes be changed?" So they conducted experiments on fox cubs at the Beijing Experimental Farm, and the results showed that their growth and development were good.
    They have many more whimsical ideas, such as using domestic cats to feed sable pups, turning smelly fur into fragrant fur, and so on.

　　想到一定能做到
    人们说：最近外贸部畜产公司在技术革命当中，有许多异想天开的事。说它异想天开，一点也不假。
    俗语说的“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，就是说，天鹅肉休想吃到，可是这个公司饲养野牲处的同志就立志要让大家吃到天鹅肉，他们准备把天鹅培养成家禽。现在，他们已经在青海柴达木盆地捉到了三只天鹅，还搜集到二十多只天鹅蛋，不久，即可用人工孵化的方法，孵出小天鹅来。
    狐狸原本属于“食肉类”的动物，可是，他们想：狗可以由食肉性变成杂食性，为什么狐狸就不能改变呢？”于是他们在北京试验场对狐狸小仔进行了试验，结果生长发育情况良好。
    他们异想天开的事还很多，比如用家猫给紫貂喂奶，把臭皮变成香皮等等。
