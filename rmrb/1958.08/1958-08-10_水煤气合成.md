Small Information

    Water gas synthesis is an important scientific research topic. As people know, natural petroleum can be extracted from the earth, and artificial petroleum can also be refined from bituminous coal or oil shale. However, the water gas synthesis industry is different. It uses coal and water as raw materials to produce raw material gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). Through a catalyst, under certain pressure and temperature conditions, it uses synthesis methods to produce crude oil, chemical raw materials, etc. It is not restricted by raw materials and can use bituminous coal, anthracite, and low-quality coal as raw materials, as well as semi-coke and natural gas. The equipment it requires is not complicated, and the technology is easy to master. It can be combined with the synthetic ammonia industry and the civil gas industry to make the fullest use of waste gas and inexpensively produce gasoline, chemical products, etc. It is a new direction for the comprehensive utilization of coal and can open up new and broad avenues for China to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry and the chemical industry. It can be built into large factories producing hundreds of thousands of tons of products per year, or small factories producing thousands of tons of products per year.

    水煤气合成
    水煤气合成，是一项重要的科学研究课题。人们都知道：从地底可以吸取出天然石油，从烟煤或者油母页岩中也能提炼出人造石油；但是水煤气合成工业却不一样。它以煤和水做原料，制成原料气（一氧化碳和氢气的混合物），通过一种催化剂，在一定的压力和温度条件下，用合成方法制成原油、化工原料等。它不受原料上的限制，既可以用烟煤、无烟煤、劣质煤做原料，也可以用半焦、天然气做原料。它需用的设备不复杂，技术上也易于掌握。它可以同合成氨工业、民用煤气工业联合起来，最充分地利用废气，廉价地生产汽油、化工产品等。它是煤的综合利用的新方向，能够为我国加快发展石油工业、化学工业开辟新的广阔道路。它既可以建成年产几十万吨产品的大型工厂，也可以建成年产几千吨产品的小型工厂。
