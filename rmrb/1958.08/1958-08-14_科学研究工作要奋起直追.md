　　Scientific Research Work Must Catch Up
　　Yin Hongzhang, Member of the Biological Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Deputy Director of the Institute of Plant Physiology

　　In one week, we participated in the measurement and harvesting of two high-yield early rice fields in Zongyang County, Anhui, and personally witnessed the "satellite" of rice with a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu taking off, feeling extremely excited and encouraged.

　　Rice fields with a yield of more than 10,000 jin are obviously different from ordinary ones, truly "looking like city walls from afar, and like rice threshing grounds up close," with a dense and thick layer of golden ears piled up about a foot high. A field of about one mu was originally thought to be finished by a few people in half a day, but more than a hundred people spent more than five hours to complete it.

　　A yield of 10,000 jin per mu has not only never been seen before, but has also never been recorded in international literature. After harvesting, several comrades from the science and technology circles took some samples and made some simple observations and analyses. The first field produced 10,142 jin of grain. The measured dry weight of the grass stalk was about 6,000 jin. After removing water from the grain, the total dry matter production per mu was about 14,000 to 15,000 jin. Based on the measurement of three leaves per tiller, it is estimated that the total number of "leaf areas" per mu is more than 26 mu. Assuming that the vigorous growth period is 90 days, and the "net photosynthetic rate" is 5 grams per square meter of leaf surface per day, it is entirely possible to accumulate 15,000 jin of dry matter per mu. The yield of the second field was even higher, reaching 16,227 jin and 13 liang. We also took samples. The leaf area has not yet been measured, but preliminary estimates are higher than the first field, with a total dry matter of more than 20,000 jin.

　　Such high yield obviously has significant implications for production, breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and playing a leading role. It also opens up a new path in scientific research. General foreign yield analysis studies show that for high-yield cereal crops, the leaf area per mu is only about four mu, the total dry weight is only about 2,000 jin, and the yield is only about 600 to 700 jin. All research revolves around this circle. Now, all the data of this high yield exceeds them by six, seven, or even ten times. This is a new field with new technologies and new theories waiting for us to explore in depth and further improve.

　　Our scientific research work is clearly lagging behind and must catch up. The Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to list the physiological basis of high crop yield as the most important research task, planning to summarize high-yield experiences, develop experimental fields, conduct a series of systematic studies, open up a new path in plant physiology, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in coordination with production.

　　The working people have created such great achievements with their unparalleled revolutionary spirit, soaring enthusiasm, and infinite wisdom, opening up new avenues for us. Scientific workers must humbly learn from them, unite with them, and advance together. Their production achievements have exceeded the international level, and our scientific research must also strive for the world's top position.

### 科学研究工作要奋起直追

　　科学研究工作要奋起直追
　　中国科学院生物学部委员植物生理研究所副所长　殷宏章
    在一个星期里，我们在安徽枞阳县连着参加了两块高产早稻的丈量和收割，亲自看见亩产万斤以上的水稻“卫星”上天，感到无比的兴奋和鼓舞。
    万斤以上的稻田一看就与一般的不同，真是“远看像城墙，近看像稻场”，一片密密麻麻的，金色穗子堆起一尺来厚。一块一亩左右的田，原想几个人半天可以搞完，结果百多人整整搞了五个多小时才完。
    每亩万斤的产量，不仅没有看见过，国际文献中也没有过。在收割后，几位科学技术界的同志取了一些标本，回来作了一些简单的观察分析。第一块田产谷一万零一百四十二斤，测出草秆干重约合六千斤，加上谷产去水，每亩总产干物质约在一万四、五千斤左右。以每个分蘖三个叶子来测定，估计每亩“叶面积”总数合到二十六亩多，设想生长旺期为九十天，“净光合率”每平方公尺叶面每天计五克，每亩累积一万五千斤的干物质是完全可以获得的。第二块田产量更高，达到一万六千二百二十七斤十三两。我们也取了样，叶面积还没有测定，初步估计，比第一块还要高，总干物质要在二万斤以上。
    这样的高产在生产中显然有重大的意义，打破迷信，解放思想，起了带头作用；在科学研究工作中也打开了一条新道路。一般国外的产量分析研究，丰产的谷类作物，每亩叶面积不过四亩，总干物重不过两千斤，产量不过六、七百斤，一切的研究也是在这个圈里打转。现在这个高产的一切的数据都超过了它们六、七倍至十几倍，这是一个新领域，其中有新的技术和新的理论，等待我们深入探讨，再进一步提高。
    我们的科学研究工作显然是落后了，必须奋起直追。中国科学院植物生理研究所已经决定把作物高产生理基础列为最重要的研究任务，计划总结高产经验，开展试验田，作一系列有系统的研究，在植物生理学中开展一个新的道路，配合生产，多快好省的建设社会主义。
    劳动人民以盖世的革命气魄，冲天的干劲，无穷的智慧，创造出来这样的巨大成果，替我们打开新的途径，科学工作者必须虚心地向他们学习，跟他们结合一起，共同前进。他们的生产成就已超过国际水平，我们科学研究也要争取世界首位。
