Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 14th: According to reports in local newspapers on the 14th, insurgent forces in the Lebanese regions of Hermel and Baalbek announced on the 13th that they would never lay down their arms until the last soldier of the American occupation forces leaves Beirut and Camille Chamoun steps down.

This decision was made at a meeting held on the 13th at the headquarters of the Hermel insurgent forces. Members of the Baalbek insurgent forces participated in the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the current situation in Lebanon and the measures to be taken to achieve the goals of the uprising.

The meeting made the following decisions: the Hermel and Baalbek insurgent forces are prepared to cope with developments in Lebanon, both domestic and foreign; take steps to stop American armed aggression and promote the withdrawal of the occupation forces from Lebanon; fight to drive Camille Chamoun out of office; fight against the gangs of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and other traitors; and do everything possible to ensure the safety and stability of all residents of these two regions. The two insurgent forces also sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld stating that the official Lebanese delegation attending the emergency session of the UN General Assembly does not represent the Lebanese people. The telegram refuted the conspiracy of imperialism colluding with the corrupt ruling clique of Lebanon, attempting to "internationalize" Lebanon. The telegram also stated that any decision that the UN General Assembly may make without considering the will and wishes of the Lebanese people will be rejected.

　　黎两地区起义部队决坚持斗争
　　直到最后一个美国兵撤走为止
    新华社大马士革14日电　据这里的报纸14日报道，黎巴嫩赫迈勒和巴尔贝克地区的起义部队在13日宣布，他们决不放下武器，直到美国占领军最后一个士兵离开贝鲁特和夏蒙下台的时候为止。
    这个决定是13日在赫迈勒起义部队总部举行的会议上作出的。参加这次会议的有巴尔贝克起义部队的成员。举行这次会议的目的是：讨论当前的黎巴嫩局势和为实现起义的目的而采取的措施。
    会议作出了下列决定：赫迈勒和巴尔贝克起义部队准备好应付黎巴嫩国内外事态的发展；采取步骤来制止美国武装侵略并且促使占领军从黎巴嫩撤退；为把夏蒙赶下台去而进行斗争；同国家社会党匪帮和其他一些卖国贼作斗争；尽一切力量来确保这两个地区的所有居民的安全和稳定。这两支起义部队还打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，出席联合国大会紧急会议的黎巴嫩官方代表团并不代表黎巴嫩人民。电报驳斥了帝国主义同黎巴嫩的腐败的统治集团互相勾结，企图使黎巴嫩“国际化”的阴谋。电报还说，联合国大会在没有考虑到黎巴嫩人民的意志和愿望的情况下可能作出的任何决定都将遭到拒绝。
