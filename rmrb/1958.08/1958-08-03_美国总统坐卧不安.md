    The President's office is so lonely,
    Like a funeral home at night.
    The U.S. President has a thousand wrinkles on his forehead,
    Sitting blankly at his desk.
    He's becoming more and more irritable,
    His face is full of worries,
    Only a matter of days,
    It feels like dozens of winters have passed.
    He originally wanted to swallow Lebanon in one gulp,
    And then use Iraq as a spearhead,
    To chop the national liberation movement of the Middle East,
    Into pieces under his butcher's knife.
    This is just a pipe dream,
    The anti-aggression storm keeps him awake all night.
    He lowers his head wearily,
    Rubbing his red and swollen eyes fiercely.
    Things going against his wishes has become his fate,
    More than ten years of accounts are all losses!
    The prestige of the United States is like autumn yellow leaves,
    The days of being carried away are long gone!
    The serious warnings from the Soviet Union and China,
    Have long made the President tremble with fear,
    The Soviet Union's suggestion to hold a summit conference,
    Is even more like a sudden hailstorm that throws him into a panic.
    He once prided himself on careful consideration,
    Unexpected things keep happening one after another;
    Passive, passive, a hundred times passive,
    His mood is even more somber.
    He is flustered and doesn't know what to do,
    The Soviet proposal is like a bomb!
    A summit meeting is the general trend,
    He worries and says to himself: what to do?
    Ten thousand tons of steel plates are pressing on his back,
    The President feels more alone than ever before,
    Sweat poured all over his body,
    How ugly is the President's face.
    He is like a rat in a cage with legs but no escape,
    He is like a toad trapped in the mud.
    The east wind is blowing vigorously,
    Making the White House like a cradle.
    The old president left his desk,
    And staggered to the window,
    He leaned weakly against the window and looked into the distance,
    Only to see the setting sun sinking in the west!

    美国总统坐卧不安
    沙鸥
    总统办公室好寂寞，
    好像殡仪馆的夜晚。
    美国总统的额上有千条皱纹，
    呆呆地坐在桌前。
    他越来越暴躁了，
    满脸都是愁烦，
    不过是几天的事情，
    仿佛过了几十个冬天。
    原想一口吃掉黎巴嫩
    转手把伊拉克挑在枪尖，
    让中东的民族解放运动，
    在他的屠刀下剁得稀烂。
    这只是一场春梦，
    反侵略的狂浪使他通宵不眠。
    他疲乏地低下头，
    狠狠揉着红肿的双眼。
    事与愿违已成了他的命运，
    十多年一本账簿全是亏欠！
    美国的威风已如秋天黄叶，
    得意忘形的日子早一去不返！
    苏联、中国的严重警告，
    早使总统心惊肉颤，
    苏联又建议召开首脑会议，
    更如突来的冰雹使他慌乱。
    他曾自命考虑周全，
    想不到的事情却层出不断；
    被动，被动，百个被动，
    他的心情更加灰暗。
    他惶惶然不知如何是好，
    苏联建议像一个炸弹！
    首脑会议已是大势所趋，
    他发愁地自语：怎么办？
    万吨钢板压在他背上，
    总统感到从没有过的孤单，
    冷汗流了一身，
    总统的脸色多么难看。
    他好比笼中鼠有腿难逃，
    他好比癞蛤蟆困在泥滩。
    东风在一个劲地刮呀，
    刮得白宫像一只摇篮。
    老迈的总统离开了办公桌，
    踉踉跄跄地走到窗前，
    他身无力地扶窗远望，
    只见夕阳正落下西山！
