Discussing the Film "The Long Road"
　　Liu Liaoyi

　　The film "The Long Road" is adapted from the Russian writer Korolenko's (1853-1921) novel "At-Davan" (the name of a post station), and it exposes the evil essence of the Tsarist system through the tragedy of a minor official.

　　One snowy night, in a remote and desolate post station in Siberia, the station manager Vasily tells the story of his life to several passing guests by candlelight. This dispirited and haggard Vasily was a rather dashing tenth-rank civil servant when he was young. At that time, he had a beautiful and lovely fiancée, and the two often played by the sea, living a life of contentment. But the good times quickly turned into a dream, and his fiancée was spotted by his superior, Ratkin. This Ratkin was only a fifth-rank councilor, but everyone flattered him by calling him General. He forced Vasily to act as a matchmaker, thus proving to Laya that her fiancé no longer loved her. Vasily, who was used to being a slave, dared not disobey his superior's orders. But just as the old man was kneeling in front of Laya, kissing her hand to propose marriage, Vasily, in agonizing pain, fired two shots at him in a daze. Afterwards, he was sentenced to exile here.

　　In the film "The Long Road," Vasily, this minor character, is portrayed delicately and movingly, and is a very successful artistic image. Vasily is reminiscent of Akaky Akakievich from "The Overcoat." They are both low-ranking employees who are powerless, humiliated, and unable to maintain even a basic sense of human dignity. They are law-abiding, docile, and never dare to have extravagant ideas. For Vasily, the greatest happiness is to achieve the goal of marrying his fiancée, and hoping to be promoted from a tenth-rank civil servant to an eighth-rank civil servant is considered a bold fantasy. However, even this pitiful hope was tragically shattered.

　　Vasily fired two shots at his superior, but we don't feel that this is a heroic act. He only did it in a state of mental confusion to alleviate his pain. In Vasily's life, he also did something that seemed heroic. On the night he was recalling the past to the travelers, a bailiff came to the post station. This was a lawless bully who never paid for using the post station's horses and even beat people. But this time, Vasily dared to ask him for money according to the regulations, which seemed like "rebellion" to the bailiff. Did Vasily really have the courage to "rebel"? No. This was because he was still immersed in the memories of the past, and the momentary anger caused by this still echoed in his heart, causing him to make a small demonstration against the demon. Vasily is a petty-bourgeois type of character who is at the mercy of fate. Nevertheless, the above two actions are, after all, a kind of resistance, a spark-like flash of human self-esteem and anger at violence in a tiny soul, so they are still valuable.

　　Vasily's fiancée, Laya, has a completely different character. She is an imaginative and brave girl who later became the wife of her teacher, a young revolutionary. Also on that night, she passed by there on her way to exile in Siberia as a political prisoner. They met for the last time, and under the bailiff's urgent urging, they didn't even have time to say a word before parting. Laya embarked on the long journey of exile, which symbolizes the path taken by the Russian people in search of freedom and truth. It is a long path, but it leads to victory. Vasily is walking another path, also a long one, but one that is forever filled with humiliation and servitude, a path that will never end.

　　Looking at "The Long Road" today will undoubtedly make us despise the old era and those humble characters even more, and at the same time, it will also prompt us to cherish this bright and brilliant today even more.

### 谈谈影片“漫长的路”

　　谈谈影片“漫长的路”
　　刘辽逸
    影片“漫长的路”是根据俄国作家柯罗连科（1853—1921）的小说“阿特—达万”（驿站的名称）改编的，它通过一个小官吏的悲剧，暴露了沙皇制度的罪恶本质。
    一个风雪之夜，在遥远的西伯利亚一处荒凉的小驿站里，驿站管事的瓦西里在烛光下给几个过路客人讲述自己的身世。这个神色潦倒、形容苍老的瓦西里，年轻时是一个颇为潇洒的十等文官。那时他有一个美丽可爱的未婚妻，两个人常常在海滨嬉戏，生活是称心如意的。可是好景很快变为一场梦幻，他的未婚妻被上司拉特金看中了。这位拉特金不过是五等参事官，可是人家都逢迎地称他将军大人。他逼着瓦西里出面做媒，这样来向拉雅证明她的未婚夫已经不爱她了。做惯了奴才的瓦西里哪敢违抗上司的命令。可是正在老头子跪在拉雅面前吻手求婚的时候，瓦西里在绞心的痛苦中昏昏迷迷地朝着他放了两枪。以后他就被判决流放到这里。
    在影片“漫长的路”里，瓦西里这个小人物刻画得细腻动人，是一个十分成功的艺术形象。瓦西里令人想起了“外套”的阿卡基·阿卡基耶维奇，他们都是无权、受辱、连起码的人的尊严都不能维持的小职员；他们奉公守法、安分守己，从来不敢作非分之想。对于瓦西里，最大的幸福不过是能达到和未婚妻结婚的目的，而盼望由十等文官升到八等文官，就算是胆大妄想了。可是，连这点可怜的希望都遭到了悲惨的破灭。
    瓦西里对上司放了两枪，但我们并不觉得这是英勇的行为。他不过是为了减轻痛苦在精神恍惚中做出来的。在瓦西里一生中，还做了一件好像是英勇的事。在他向旅客们回忆往事的那天晚上，驿站里来了一个差官，这是一个无法无天的恶霸，他使用驿站的马匹从来不付钱，而且还要打人。可是那次瓦西里却胆敢按照规定向他要钱，这在那个差官看来简直是“造反”。难道瓦西里真有“造反”的勇气吗？不是的。这是因为他当时仍沉湎在往事的回忆中，由此引起的一时激愤仍在他心中回荡，使他对那个恶魔作了一次小小的示威。瓦西里是一个听候命运摆布的小市民型的人物。虽然如此，但上述两次举动毕竟是一种反抗，是人的自尊感和对强暴的愤怒在渺小的灵魂中火花似的一闪，所以仍然是可贵的。
    瓦西里的未婚妻拉雅有着全然不同的性格，她是一个富于幻想而且勇敢的姑娘，后来做了她的教师——青年革命家的妻子。也在那天晚上，她以政治犯的身分在流放西伯利亚途中经过那里。他们最后见了一面，在那个差官的火急催促下，竟没来得及说一句话就分手了。拉雅又踏上了流放的征途，而瓦西里仍留在这被人遗忘的角落里。拉雅所走的千里迢迢的流放旅途，正象征着俄罗斯人民在寻求自由和真理所走的路，它是漫长的，然而是通向胜利的路。瓦西里走着另一条路，也是漫长的，然而却是永远充满着屈辱和奴役、永远走不尽头的路。
    在今天来看“漫长的路”无疑会使我们更加鄙弃那旧的时代和那些卑微的人物，同时也会促使我们更加珍爱这光明灿烂的今天。
