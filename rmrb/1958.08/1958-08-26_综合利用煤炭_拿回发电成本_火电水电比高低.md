Xinhua News Agency report: The National On-Site Conference on Comprehensive Utilization of Coal and Ash in Thermal Power Generation concluded in Jilin City on the 20th. The conference, based on the principle of "one factory, multiple capabilities; one material, multiple uses; one person, multiple skills," determined that comprehensively utilizing coal and ash while generating electricity is an important direction and content of the technological revolution in the national thermal power generation system in the future. It also put forward the slogan "Thermal power generation costs should compete with hydroelectric power costs."

China has a large coal output, and coal contains many important substances. Some have calculated that if all the coal used for combustion nationwide last year were comprehensively utilized, 7.5 million tons of coal tar and 490,000 tons of refined benzene could be extracted. The refined benzene alone, when made into the synthetic fiber Kapron, could replace more than 46 million dan of cotton, which is more than the total national cotton production last year. Thermal power plants are one of the largest coal-consuming sectors in China, using a quarter of the country's total coal production last year. Therefore, comprehensive utilization of coal resources has become an urgent and important issue for thermal power plants to solve. Currently, some people still have concerns about the comprehensive utilization of coal and ash, fearing that it will affect their "main business," fearing that the gains will not outweigh the losses, etc. At this conference, many units used concrete facts to prove that these concerns are unfounded. Experiments have shown that a small power plant that consumes 5,200 tons of coal annually can recover 54 tons of light diesel, 140 tons of heavy diesel, 33 tons of crude phenol, 3,147 tons of petroleum coke and semi-coke, 30 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer, and 10,000 cubic meters of high-quality gas from the comprehensive utilization of coal. These products can almost be exchanged for 12,000 tons of coal. Comprehensive utilization of coal and ash can not only greatly reduce power generation costs but also potentially recoup the power generation costs from the comprehensive utilization.

During the conference, representatives from power plants and scientific research institutions across the country widely exchanged experimental and scientific research results on the comprehensive utilization of coal and ash, proving that the comprehensive utilization of coal and ash is not as mysterious and unattainable as some people imagine. The conference decided to implement the principle of "combining key points with broader application," adopting the method of "using small-scale operations to support large-scale operations and relying on self-reliance," first conducting key experiments to actively create conditions for widespread adoption.

The attending representatives successively put forward guarantees, vowing to go all out. According to preliminary plans proposed by various regions, coal ash alone can be used to produce more than 131,000 tons of cement this year, and it can leap to 2.6 million tons next year.

### 综合利用煤炭　拿回发电成本  火电水电比高低

　　综合利用煤炭　拿回发电成本
    火电水电比高低
    据新华社讯　全国火力发电煤、灰综合利用现场会议，20日在吉林市结束。会议根据“一厂多能，一物多用，一人多艺”的原则，确定在发电的同时，综合利用煤、灰，是全国火力发电系统今后技术革命的重要方向和内容，并提出“火力发电成本要同水力发电成本较量高低”的口号。
    我国煤炭产量很大，煤炭中含有很多重要物质。有人计算，如果去年全国用于燃烧的煤炭全部加以综合利用，可以提炼出七百五十万吨焦油和四十九万吨精苯，其中仅精苯制成合成纤维卡普隆，就能代替四千六百多万担棉花，这个数字比去年全国棉花总产量还要多。火电厂是我国用煤最多的部门之一，去年用了全国煤炭总产量的四分之一。因此，综合利用煤炭资源就成为火力发电厂迫切需要解决的重要问题。目前有些人对综合利用煤、灰还有顾虑，怕影响“正业”，怕得不偿失，等等。在这次会议上，许多单位用具体事实证明这些顾虑是没有根据的。实验证明：一座每年耗用五千二百吨煤的小型电厂，如果把煤全部综合利用起来，从中能收回轻柴油五十四吨，重柴油一百四十吨，粗酚三十三吨，石油焦和半焦三千一百四十七吨，硫铵肥料三十吨，高质煤气一万立方公尺。这些产品差不多可换回一万二千吨煤。综合利用煤、灰，不仅可以大大降低发电成本，而且有可能将发电成本从综合利用中拿回来。
    会议期间，来自全国各地的电厂、科学研究机关的代表，广泛地交流了煤、灰综合利用的试验和科学研究成果，证明了煤、灰综合利用并不像某些人想像的那么神秘和高不可攀。会议确定贯彻“点面结合”的方针，采取“以小养大、自力更生”的方法，首先进行重点试验，为遍地开花积极创造条件。
    到会代表纷纷提出保证，要大干一番。据各地初步提出的规划看，仅用煤灰一项，今年就可以生产十三万一千多吨水泥，明年可跃进到二百六十万吨。
