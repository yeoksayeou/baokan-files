Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: The Fourth National Judicial Work Conference, jointly convened by the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice starting from June 23rd, successfully concluded on the 20th.

　　This conference was a large-scale rectification meeting for national judicial work. Participants included the heads of People's Courts and Justice Departments (Bureaus) of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as the heads, judges, and clerks of intermediate and basic-level courts. Using the method of rectification, they reviewed and summarized the judicial work of the past eight years, clarified some judicial cadres' vague understanding of some fundamental issues such as the nature of the People's Court, and further clarified the future tasks of the people's judicial work.

　　During the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the CPC Central Committee received all the representatives. Comrades Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, and others delivered reports at the meeting and gave important instructions on judicial work. The representatives seriously discussed these reports.

　　The conference affirmed that the achievements of judicial work are enormous. In the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the broad masses of the people, the People's Courts at all levels, in coordination with relevant departments, completed the trial tasks in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries; at the same time, they also tried other criminal and civil cases; combined with trial activities, they vigorously carried out the propaganda work of revolutionary legal system among the people, which played an active role in ensuring the smooth completion of our national economic recovery work and the first Five-Year Plan, promoting the development of socialist cause, and preventing crime and illegal behavior. With the development of the situation, much work has also been done in the ideological construction, organizational construction, and system construction of the people's judicial work. The judicial reform movement carried out by judicial organs at all levels in 1952 and the rectification and anti-rightist struggle carried out in 1957 are of extremely important significance to the construction of the people's judicial system. The anti-rightist struggle was a more intense and profound struggle between socialism and capitalism on the judicial front after the basic completion of socialist transformation. Under the leadership of the Party, the People's Courts at all levels achieved a decisive victory in this struggle, systematically exposed and criticized various anti-proletarian dictatorship and anti-socialist views in the judicial field, further purified the ranks of judicial cadres, and improved the political awareness and ideological level of judicial cadres. Since this spring, a new situation of great leap forward has also emerged in judicial work. Under the leadership of the Party and in the midst of the nationwide great leap forward, the People's Courts in various places have gone deep into reality, relied on the masses, and actively cooperated with public security and procuratorial organs to punish the remnant counter-revolutionaries and various bad elements who sabotage industrial and agricultural production and disrupt social order, and also timely handled some civil cases, and more fully conducted socialist legal system education to the people, which has played a very good role in safeguarding and promoting the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and consolidating the internal unity of the people.

　　When reviewing the work, the conference conducted full discussions, systematically and profoundly exposed the ugly face of bourgeois legal viewpoints, clarified some erroneous and reactionary views of some judicial cadres on issues such as the nature and tasks of the People's Court and the Party's leadership over the People's Court, and reached a clear understanding of these issues. The conference held that the people's democratic dictatorship practiced in our country is a dictatorship over the enemy and democracy among the people. It is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat, which is essentially a proletarian dictatorship. The People's Court is an important weapon of the proletarian dictatorship. Its struggle is always directed against counter-revolutionaries and various criminals who disrupt socialist order and endanger the interests of the people. Through the trial of these criminals, it serves the class struggle, the central work of the Party and the state, and socialist construction. At the same time, it also protects the democratic rights of the people and protects the interests of the people. All views and practices that ignore the court's dictatorial function, separate dictatorship from democracy, or talk vaguely about democracy and ignore dictatorship, will inevitably weaken the proletarian dictatorship, which is detrimental to the people and detrimental to socialist construction. The conference pointed out that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental issue of the proletarian dictatorship and the fundamental guarantee for carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction. The People's Court should absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, and there should be no slightest neglect or wavering. To competently complete the sacred tasks entrusted by the state and the people, the court must not only resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party Central Committee, but also resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party committees at all levels. Only in this way can we ensure that the work of the court is guided by the correct policies, adapts to the changes in the situation of class struggle and the needs of production development, and concretely implement the Party's policies and principles. The conference also believed that judicial work must resolutely implement the mass line, cherish and support the creativity of the masses on the premise of observing the law, and conscientiously summarize and promote the experience of combining legal sanctions with the exposure and criticism of the masses, and combining court trials with mass debates, so that the people's judicial work becomes a work that relies on the masses and involves the participation of the masses, rather than an isolated activity of the judicial organs. The conference required courts in various places to wage a resolute struggle against the old judicial style that is divorced from the masses while implementing the mass line, and to thoroughly change some bad styles of being divorced from the masses. Only in this way can judicial organs be combined with the broad masses of the people, and can the role of judicial work in strengthening dictatorship and protecting the people be fully发挥.

　　The conference also exchanged experiences in the great leap forward of judicial work and discussed the future tasks of the People's Court. The conference believed that the People's Court should follow the Party's general line for socialist construction, strengthen trial activities, and serve the class struggle and the central work of the Party. At present, there is still imperialism in the international arena, and there is still a serious class struggle; domestically, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, are always the main contradictions. This contradiction is manifested as a fierce, life-and-death contradiction between the enemy and ourselves in some areas, and as a contradiction within the people in most cases. At the same time, these two different types of contradictions may sometimes transform into each other. The People's Court must distinguish the nature of the contradictions and, through trial activities, correctly, legally, and timely handle criminal and civil cases, consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, enhance the internal unity of the people, and ensure and promote the smooth development of socialist cause.

　　The conference also conducted a comprehensive and profound exposure and criticism of a series of errors committed by the Party Group of the Ministry of Justice in the past two or three years that violated the Party's leadership, policies, and principles.

　　This conference has great educational significance for judicial cadres. The representatives attending the conference emancipated their minds and boosted their morale through this conference. They firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, and closely cooperating with various departments, through the efforts of all judicial cadres, using Marxism-Leninism and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely be able to quickly build a socialist judicial work system that is completely suitable for China's conditions in terms of theory, system, and style, and plant red flags of the general line all over the judicial front.

　　对敌人实行专政　对人民实行民主
    在司法战线上遍插红旗
    全国司法工作会议总结过去工作确定今后工作任务
    新华社28日讯　最高人民法院和司法部从6月23日起联合召开的第四届全国司法工作会议已在20日胜利闭幕。
    这次会议是全国司法工作一次规模巨大的整风会。参加会议的除各省、市、自治区人民法院和司法厅（局）的负责人外，还有中级法院和基层法院的负责人、审判员、书记员。他们用整风的方法，检查和总结了八年多来的司法工作，澄清了部分司法干部对人民法院性质等一些根本问题的模糊认识，并进一步明确了人民司法工作的今后任务。
    会议期间，毛泽东主席和中共中央其他领导人员接见了全体代表，董必武、彭真、罗瑞卿等同志到会作了报告，并对司法工作作了重要指示。到会代表认真地讨论了这些报告。
    会议肯定司法工作的成绩是巨大的。在过去的八年中，各级人民法院在党的领导下，依靠广大群众的支持，协同有关部门完成了肃清反革命的斗争中的审判工作任务；同时还审判了其他刑事和民事案件；结合审判活动，在人民群众中大力进行了革命法制的宣传工作，这对保障我国国民经济恢复工作和第一个五年建设计划的顺利完成，促进社会主义事业的发展，预防犯罪和违法行为，起了积极的作用。随着形势的发展，在人民司法工作的思想建设、组织建设和制度建设方面，也作了许多工作。各级司法机关在1952年进行的司法改革运动和在1957年进行的整风和反右派斗争，对人民司法建设有着极为重要的意义。反右派斗争，是在社会主义改造基本完成之后，司法战线上社会主义同资本主义两条道路的一场更激烈、更深刻的斗争。各级人民法院在党的领导下取得了这场斗争的决定性的胜利，系统地揭露和批判了在司法方面的各样各色的反无产阶级专政、反社会主义的观点，进一步纯洁了司法干部的队伍，提高了司法干部的政治觉悟和思想水平。今春以来，司法工作也出现了大跃进的新局面。各地人民法院在党的领导下和全民大跃进中，深入实际，依靠群众，积极地协同公安、检察机关惩办了破坏工农业生产、破坏社会秩序的残余反革命分子和各种坏分子，还及时地处理了一些民事案件，并且更加充分地向人民群众进行了社会主义法制教育，对保卫和促进工农业生产大跃进，巩固人民内部团结，起了很好的作用。
    会议在检查工作时，进行了充分的讨论，系统地、深刻地揭露了资产阶级法律观点的丑恶面貌，澄清了部分司法干部对人民法院性质和任务、党对人民法院的领导等问题的一些错误的和反动的看法，并对这些问题有了明确的认识。会议认为，我国实行的人民民主专政，是对敌人实行专政，对人民实行民主，是无产阶级领导的人民民主专政，实质上就是无产阶级专政。人民法院是无产阶级专政的一个重要武器，它的斗争锋芒始终是对着反革命分子和各种破坏社会主义秩序、危害人民利益的犯罪分子，并通过对这些罪犯的审判活动为阶级斗争、为党和国家的中心工作、为社会主义建设服务，同时也就是保护人民的民主权利，保护人民的利益。一切那种忽视法院的专政职能，把专政和民主割裂开来，或者泛谈民主，忽视专政的观点和作法，其结果必然是削弱了无产阶级专政，对人民不利，对社会主义建设不利。会议指出，党的领导是无产阶级专政的根本问题，是进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的根本保证。人民法院应该绝对服从党的领导，不能有丝毫的忽视和动摇。法院要胜任地完成国家、人民所付托的神圣任务，不仅要坚决依靠党中央的领导，而且要坚决依靠各级党委的领导。只有这样，才能保证法院工作在正确方针的指导下，适应阶级斗争形势的变化和生产发展的需要，具体贯彻党的方针政策。会议并认为，司法工作必须坚决贯彻群众路线，在遵守法律的前提下，珍视和支持群众的创造，把已经涌现出来的法律制裁和群众的揭发批判相结合、法庭审判和群众辩论相结合的经验，切实加以总结和推广，使人民的司法工作成为依靠群众、有群众参加的工作，而不是司法机关的孤立的活动。会议要求各地法院在贯彻群众路线的同时，必须同脱离群众的旧司法作风作坚决的斗争，彻底转变某些脱离群众的不良作风。只有这样，才能使司法机关和广大群众相结合，才能充分发挥司法工作的加强专政、保护人民的作用。
    会议还交流了司法工作大跃进的经验，讨论了人民法院的今后任务。会议认为，人民法院应该遵循党的社会主义建设的总路线，加强审判活动，为阶级斗争和为党的中心工作服务。目前，在国际上还有帝国主义，还有严重的阶级斗争；在国内，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争、社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，始终是主要矛盾。这个矛盾，在某些范围内表现为激烈的、你死我活的敌我矛盾，在大多数的情况下表现为人民内部的矛盾，同时，这两种不同性质的矛盾，有时又可能互相转化。人民法院必须分清矛盾的性质，通过审判活动，正确、合法、及时地处理刑事和民事案件，巩固无产阶级专政，增强人民内部团结，保障和促进社会主义事业的顺利发展。
    会议还对司法部党组近两三年以来所犯的一系列的违反党的领导、方针政策的错误，进行了全面、深刻的揭发和批判。
    这次会议对司法干部有很大的教育意义。到会代表通过这次会议解放了思想，鼓足了干劲。他们坚信：在党的领导下，依靠群众，和各部门密切协作，经过全体司法干部的努力，运用马克思列宁主义，并在毛泽东思想的指导下，一定能够很快地从理论上、制度上、作风上把完全适合中国情况的社会主义司法工作体系建设起来，在司法战线上插遍总路线的红旗。
