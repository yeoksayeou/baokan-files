    Our Air Force and Naval Aviation Vigilantly Defend the Motherland's Airspace
    Ready to Strike a Painful Blow Against Chiang Gang Provocations
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st - "Liberation Army Daily" reporter Li Po reports: Since the beginning of this year, the Air Force and Naval Aviation units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have continuously achieved victories in air combat, severely打击打 the Chiang Kai-shek planes, which constantly harassed our southeastern coastal areas under the instigation of US imperialism.
    The Second Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit on the Fujian front achieved seven victories in nine battles from January to May this year, shooting down two Chiang planes and damaging five. The battle of Jiangjun'ao in southern Fujian on February 15 was particularly outstanding. On that day, four Chiang army F-84 aircraft circled over Kinmen, feigning exercises, attempting to 麻痹 our army's attention. Then, they suddenly passed through Dongding Island and attacked Jiangjun'ao along the coast. The officers and soldiers of the Second Company, who had been waiting for a long time, had already seen through the enemy's tricks and made combat preparations. After the enemy planes entered our firing range, the commander gave an order, and the artillery roared together, resulting in one enemy plane being shot down and one damaged. The shot-down enemy plane crashed into the sea. In the battle, the firing accuracy of the officers and soldiers of the anti-aircraft artillery units was greatly improved. The Second Company of a certain unit averaged twenty-two shells to hit an enemy plane this year. On February 3, the Third Squad of the Third Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment on the Fujian front created the glorious example of using two shells in three seconds to shoot down a Chiang army F-84 aircraft entering at high speed from a height of one hundred meters. Under the heavy打击打 of our Air Force and Naval Aviation fighter plane units, the Chiang planes, frightened by the beating, often adopted high-altitude, high-speed, low-altitude, low-speed tactics, using nighttime and adverse weather conditions to窜扰 the mainland. However, they still continued to suffer歼灭性 blows. In the air battle over the Shandong Peninsula on February 18 this year, Hu Chunsheng, the squadron leader of the Naval Aviation, shot down a Chiang army RB-57 American-made jet reconnaissance bomber at an altitude of 15,000 meters. In the air battle in the border area of Fujian and Jiangxi on April 21, under the adverse weather conditions of nighttime thunderstorms, our fighter planes, under the guidance of the command post, hit wherever they were directed, damaging a Chiang army B-17 four-engine large bomber that had 窜扰 the mainland. In the air battle in the Liancheng area of Fujian on June 17, when the enemy planes attempted to escape from low altitude, our planes chased from an altitude of more than 10,000 meters to 1,500 meters, finally destroying the enemy planes. On July 29, our Southern Air Force, with a one-on-one force, shot down and damaged three American-made F-84 Chiang planes in a two-minute air battle.
    At present, the vast number of officers and soldiers of our Air Force and Naval Aviation are highly vigilant and closely watching the activities of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique under its instigation. They say heroically that if the planes of the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the instigation of US imperialism dare to continue 窜扰 the mainland and undermine our socialist construction, they will be given a ruthless打击打.

    我空军和海军航空兵警惕地捍卫着祖国领空
    随时准备痛击蒋帮挑衅
    新华社31日讯　解放军报记者李坡报道：中国人民解放军空军和海军航空兵各部队，今年以来，不断获得对空作战的胜利，严重打击了在美帝国主义指使下不断骚扰我东南沿海地区的蒋机。
    福建前线高射炮兵某部二连，今年1至5月份，九战七捷，打落蒋机两架，击伤蒋机五架。其中2月15日闽南将军澳战斗最为出色。这天蒋军F—84型飞机四架，先在金门上空盘旋，伪装演习，企图麻痹我军注意力。然后突然经过东定岛，沿海岸向将军澳袭来，等待已久的二连官兵，早已识破敌人诡计，做好了战斗准备，敌机进入我火力圈之后，指挥员一声令下，大炮一齐怒吼，结果击落、击伤敌机各一架。被击落的敌机坠入海中。在战斗中，各高射炮部队指战员射击的准确性大为提高。某部二连今年平均二十二发炮弹击中一架敌机。2月3日，福建前线高射炮某团三连三班创造了三秒钟用两发炮弹，打落一百公尺高度大速度进入的蒋机F—84型飞机一架的光辉战例。在我空军和海军航空兵歼击机部队的沉重打击下，被打怕了的蒋机常常采用高空大速度、低空小速度，利用夜间不良气候等条件窜扰大陆。但是，它们仍然不断遭受到歼灭性打击。今年2月18日山东半岛空战中，海军航空兵胡春生中队长，就在一万五千公尺高空击落了蒋军RB—57型美造喷气侦察轰炸机一架。4月21日闽赣交界地区空战中，在夜间有雷雨的恶劣气象条件下，我歼击机在指挥所的引导下，指到哪里，打到哪里，击伤了窜扰大陆的蒋军B—17型四引擎大型轰炸机一架。6月17日福建连城地区空战中，敌机企图从低空逃跑，我机从一万多公尺高空追至一千五百公尺，终将敌机击毁。7月29日，我南方空军以一对一的兵力，在两分钟的空战里，又一举击落击伤了美制F—84型蒋机三架。
    目前我空军和海军航空兵广大指战员，正高度警惕地注视着美帝国主义及其指使下的蒋介石集团的活动。他们豪迈地说，如果美帝国主义指使下的蒋介石集团的飞机胆敢继续窜扰大陆，破坏我们的社会主义建设，定将予以无情的痛击。
