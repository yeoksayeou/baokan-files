Ode to the Xushui People's Commune
By Our Special Correspondent Kang Tuo

II. Complete in Industry, Commerce and All Trades

What I Saw at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative

Militarization is only one aspect of the Xushui People's Commune. However, because of militarization, anyone who walks into any village in Xushui during the day will not find anyone. If you need to find someone, there is only one place to ask: the supply and marketing cooperative of the People's Commune. But if you walk into the supply and marketing cooperative in this hot weather, before you even speak, the salesperson will greet you first:

"Comrade, it's hot! Take a break! Have a bottle of soda or a bottle of orange juice?"

Soda and juice are not special commodities in the People's Commune here. For those who like to smoke good cigarettes, some supply and marketing cooperatives have "Peony" cigarettes; for those who like to drink alcohol, Xushui also has its own specialty. Xushui's wine was so good even during the Jin Dynasty that one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, Liu Ling, was drunk every day. At that time, Liu Ling lived in his friend Zhang Hua's house in what is now Zhanghua Village. Or, if you don't drink alcohol, you can buy milk powder, which is also produced in this county; in the past, it was sold in loose packages, but now it has been upgraded to hard paper tubes with beautiful decorations. Some salespersons will tell you: "We have everything from silk to scallions and garlic." One day at noon, I was chatting with Zheng Lao Xiang, a salesperson in the Dasi Gezhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, when someone suddenly ran in to buy fermented bean paste. I thought the cafeteria didn't have enough dishes, so I quickly asked Zheng Lao Xiang, who said:

"The cafeteria is eating pancakes at noon! People have vegetable soup, but it's not flavorful enough, so they want to dip it in sauce and wrap it with scallions?!"

Eating pancakes with sauce, eating noodles with vinegar, eating fried dough sticks with sugar; plus daily necessities, clothing, stationery and books, the supply and marketing cooperative has everything. All the markets in Xushui have long been cancelled, and people don't have to leave the village to buy things. The supply and marketing cooperative is an important part of the People's Commune, and it is formed and developed by the union of the past cooperative stores, cooperative groups and small vendors. In addition, the rural credit cooperatives of the past have also developed into the credit departments of the People's Commune. People can deposit and borrow money from this "small bank" without having to leave the village.

This is the merging of three cooperatives, a measure taken by the county while delegating some of the financial and grain authority to the townships, that is, to the current seven People's Communes. These measures have enabled the supply and marketing cooperatives and credit departments of the People's Communes to absorb idle funds and purchase waste products, which has greatly supported the industrial construction of the People's Communes. Now there are more than 2,500 factories of all sizes in the county, and more than 2,400 are run by townships and communes, among which grain processing and locally produced chemical fertilizers have been greatly developed since the establishment of the People's Communes. The miracle of repair shops has also appeared more often after the establishment of the People's Commune. More than 300 native furnaces for iron smelting and the county's converter steelmaking are also recent events of the past month; the county produced more than 20,000 sets of ball bearings, and the bearingization of mills, grinders, vehicles and plows took place during the climax of the establishment of the People's Commune, on August 7th.

The Road of Innovation is Wider

The People's Commune does not only support industrial construction economically. Look at the iron and wood repair shop in Da Wangdian Township. It only began to attract attention in May. The first shot was the invention of a hand-cranked double-tube waterwheel by the blacksmith Zhang Guimin. Zhang Guimin had just returned from working outside when he encountered the upsurge of rectification and airing opinions in the factory. However, he couldn't speak at meetings or write big-character posters. This thin and energetic middle-aged man was so anxious that he ran around everywhere. Later, he drew a diagram of a hand-cranked double-tube waterwheel, wrote the words "I want to do it," and posted it as a big-character poster. With the support of the leadership, it was immediately successfully trial-produced. Then, he and the carpenter Cui Zhenquan jointly made a topdressing weeder seeder, and also modified the stone mill, designed a deep-plowing plow and a yam digging machine. However, they not only lacked raw materials, but also manpower; during the tense period of drought resistance, even they themselves had to stop working and go to the agricultural cooperative to push the waterwheel. It was not until the People's Commune was established, and large-scale labor cooperation and militarization were implemented, that their factory had more manpower and more detailed division of labor; at this time, they not only made deep-plowing plows and yam digging machines, but also made close-planting seeders and slicing machines, and also used old rails to create native lathes, and built small blast furnaces for iron production. In addition, the technical personnel there who are good at innovation are no longer only Zhang Guimin and Cui Zhenquan, but now there are more than ten in total.

The People's Commune has greatly stimulated people's enthusiasm for innovation. Some time ago, a small part of a pot camel machine in Xie Fang Village broke. It couldn't be bought anywhere. The pot camel machine operator carved a model of the part on a brick, and then melted the broken part and poured it onto the model. After pouring it seven times, it was finally formed. Another machine operator in Xie Fang extracted diesel and gasoline from the waste oil used by the machine, and it worked just like crude oil. These creations once caused a sensation in the county. But now that homemade tractors have been successful and county-run railways are also being planned, people take it all for granted and are not satisfied. People are still working hard to keep growing and advancing towards even greater peaks.

In Order to Realize Ideals

One of the goals of people's progress is to achieve water conservancy that exceeds ideals. Floods and droughts have been solved here, and 2,400 mechanical wells have been drilled, with 1,000 water pumping machines. The ideal for drought resistance with mechanical wells is to ensure irrigation of 500 mu of land per well, but here they want to achieve only 200 mu per well, which means they need to drill more than 1,000 mechanical wells. The People's Commune has organized mechanical well professional corps and is drilling faster and faster. A few days ago, when I was in Nan Pang Village, the township party secretary Liu Tingkui said to me with a smile:

"Don't look at the fact that we are still short of mechanical wells here, the mechanical well frames, well cones and technicians are also promoting communism, and have drawn out a lot to support other counties and provinces; hum, we will definitely complete the task!"

Liu Tingkui's smile did not reveal complacency, but rather a pride full of determination and confidence. This is the pride commonly expressed by the people of Xushui in their rapidly developing commune after Chairman Mao's inspection.

Commune, People's Commune, what a beautiful and amazing organization! Under the leadership of their respective party committees, all seven major communes in the county, after discussion, have uniformly established commune committees, and have also divided them into planning committees and twelve departments; these are farmland water conservancy, industrial transportation, post and telecommunications, forestry, animal husbandry, poultry and fisheries, finance and trade, logistics, military affairs, political and legal public security, supervision, culture, education and health, and youth (Communist Youth League), women (Women's Federation) and other departments. The plans of each department can make people open their mouths and smile for a long time. The wage system that is being aired, debated and researched for decision on the distribution system has also aroused great interest among the people. No wonder the people of Xushui regard Chairman Mao's inspection and the establishment of the commune as one thing. Now, no matter which village holds a meeting, someone will automatically speak:

"I will dedicate my saved grain to Chairman Mao's commune!"

Since the establishment of the commune, the people of the county have donated more than 420,000 jin of grain, and Zheng Lao Xiang of the Dasi Gezhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative has donated 1.5 tons of coal. In addition, private plots have long disappeared, and trees, reed fields, and even investments in livestock carts when joining the commune in the past, are also being asked to be donated, and some people even insist on donating, they say:

"Let me dedicate it! This is a disease of mine, and if I dedicate it, the disease will be cured!"

This is today's Chinese peasant, the leap forward of the communist ideology of the Chinese peasant. From here, we can see how impatiently the Chinese peasants are advancing along the road of the People's Commune – straight towards the communist paradise.

　　徐水人民公社颂

　　二、工商百业样样全
    供销部所见
    军事化只是徐水人民公社的一个内容。不过，就是由于军事化，便使得任何人在白天走进徐水的任何一个村子，都会碰不见人。要找人，只有一个地方可以去打问，那是人民公社的供销部。但你在如今这炎热的天气走进供销部，还没开口，售货员就会抢先招呼：
    “同志，热啊！快歇歇！喝瓶汽水，还是来瓶桔子汁？”
    汽水和果汁在这儿的人民公社里并不是特殊商品。爱抽好烟的，有的供销部备有“牡丹”；爱喝酒的，徐水也有特产，徐水的酒远在晋朝时候就曾使得那位竹林七贤之一的刘伶天天醉倒，当时的刘伶就住在现在的张华村里他的朋友张华家中。或者，不喝酒，要买奶粉，也有本县的出产；过去是零卖零包，现在已经跃进到硬纸筒装并且装璜漂亮。有的售货员会告诉你说：“咱们是上有绸缎，下有葱蒜的万宝全。”一天中午，我在大寺各庄供销部里同售货员郑老祥聊天，突然间有人跑来买面酱，我以为是食堂菜不够，连忙问郑老祥，他说：
    “食堂晌午吃烙饼！人们有了菜汤还不够味儿，还要沾酱包葱?！”
    吃烙饼买酱，吃面条买醋，吃炸油条买糖；外加用的、穿的直到文具书籍，供销部应有尽有。徐水所有的集市早已取消，买东西都不用出村子。供销部是人民公社的重要组成部分之一，是由过去的合作商店、合作小组和小商贩联合组成和发展起来的。此外，过去农村的信用社也发展成为了人民公社的信用部，人们存款贷款也有了这个“小银行”而不必出村。
    这就是三社合一，这是县里在把财权和粮权部分下放到乡，也即是下放到如今的七个人民公社的同时所采取的措施。这些措施使得人民公社的供销部和信用部吸收了游资和收购了废品，而这就大大支援了人民公社的工业建设。现在全县有大小工厂二千五百多个，乡社经营的就有二千四百多，其中粮食加工和土制化肥就是人民公社建立以后大大发展起来的。修配厂的奇迹也多是在人民公社建成后才更多地出现，三百多座土炉炼铁和县里的转炉出钢也是最近一个月的事；全县造出两万多套滚珠轴承，碾、磨、车、犁实现轴承化，更是在建立人民公社的高潮时候，是在8月7日那一天。
    革新道路更加宽广
    人民公社并不只是在经济上支援了工业建设。且看大王店乡的铁木修配厂。那里在5月间才开始受人注意。头一炮是铁匠张贵民发明手摇双管水车。张贵民刚从外面做活回来，正碰上厂里的整改鸣放高潮，他却会上不会发言，会下不会写大字报。这个瘦瘦的精干的中年人急得到处跑跳，后来就画了个手摇双管水车的图样，写了“我要做”三个字，当作大字报贴了出去。在领导的支持下，马上试制成功。接着，又和木匠崔振全共同制成追肥耘锄耧，并且改装石磨，设计深翻犁和刨山药机。但是，他们不仅原料不够，人力也不够；在抗旱紧张的时刻，甚至连他们自己都得停下活儿，去农业社推水车。直到公社建成，实行了劳动大协作和军事化，他们厂里才有了更多的人力和更细致的分工；而他们这时候就不仅制成了深耕犁和刨山药机，并且作了密植耧和切片机，还用旧铁轨创造了土制旋床，又建起小高炉在出铁。此外，那里善于创造发明的技术人也不再只是张贵民和崔振全，到如今一共有了十多个。
    人民公社大大激发了人们的创造热情。前些日子，谢坊村一台锅驼机坏了一个不小的零件，哪里也买不到，锅驼机手就在一块砖上刻下了那个零件的模型，然后把坏零件化开往模型上倒，倒了七次，终于倒成。谢坊的另一个机器手则在机器使过的废油中提炼出了柴油和汽油，使用起来和原油一样。这些创造，在当时曾经哄动全县。但在现在，土制拖拉机成功了，县办铁路也在计划中，而人们却把这一切看得十分自然并且很不满足，人们还在继长增高地鼓足干劲，向着更大的高峰前进。
    为了实现理想
    人们前进的目标之一，是实现超过理想的水利化。这儿洪涝灾害已经解决，机井也打了两千四百眼，抽水机器有一千台。机井抗旱的理想是一眼保浇五百亩地，这里却要做到一眼只保浇二百亩，也就是还要打一千多眼机井。人民公社就又组织了机井专业兵团，并且越打越快。前些天，我在南庞村的时候，那里的乡党委书记刘廷奎笑咪咪地对我说：
    “别看这里机井还差的不少，机井架子、井锥和技术人员也发扬共产主义，抽出了好些去支援外县外省；哼哼，咱们完成任务还是准没问题！”
    刘廷奎的笑容并没表露出自满，而是表露了充满决心和信心的自豪。这是徐水人民在毛主席视察以后，对于自己飞跃发展的公社所普遍表露的自豪。
    公社，人民公社，这是多么美好而惊人的组织！全县七大公社在各自党委会的领导下，经过讨论，都统一成立了社委会，并且还分设计划委员会和十二个部；这就是农田水利、工业交通邮电、林木、畜牧家禽鱼业、财经贸易、后勤、军事、政法公安、监察、文教卫生和青年（共青团）、妇女（妇联会）等部。每一个部的规划，都能引得人们张着嘴喜笑半天。分配制度上正在鸣放辩论和研究决定的工资制，也引起了人们极大的兴趣。难怪徐水人都把毛主席的视察和公社的建成当作了一件事。现在，不论那个村子开会，都有人自动发言道：
    “我把我的存粮献给毛主席的公社！”
    成立公社以来，全县人民献出粮食四十二万多斤，大寺各庄供销部的郑老祥献出一吨半煤。此外，自留地早已消失，树木、苇田甚至 过去入社时候牲口大车的投资，也都在纷纷要求全部献出，有的人甚至是非要献出不可，他们说：
    “快让我献了吧！这是我的一块病，献出了，病就好啦！”
    这就是今天的中国农民，是中国农民的共产主义思想的跃进。从这里可以看到，中国农民是在怎样迫不及待地沿着人民公社的道路前进——直向着共产主义的乐园。
