The Land in Latin America is Boiling

Cuba: Rebel Army Grows Stronger, Controls Vast Rural Areas; Argentine Communist Party Demands Government Free Itself from Control of U.S. Monopoly Capital; Chilean Democratic Forces Celebrate Communist Party Achieving Legal Status; Mexican Railway Workers' Strike Achieves Victory; Bolivian Railway Workers Persist in Strike Struggle; Peruvian Government Opposes U.S. Raising Import Taxes on Lead and Zinc

Cuba

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: TASS, New York, August 26th: "The New York Times" published an editorial commenting on the Cuban civil war, stating that the Batista government's strict censorship has long obscured the fact that its army is constantly defeated, while Castro's army grows stronger in battle.

The article said that despite this strict censorship, the truth is now revealed. In the two eastern provinces of Oriente and Camagüey, Cuban rebels control vast rural areas, while government troops are only concentrated in cities protected by garrisons.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Montevideo News: The Uruguayan "People's Daily" recently reprinted an article from the "Continental News" issued by the Cuban rebel forces, which reported on the vigorous development of the Cuban rebel struggle.

The article first pointed out that the rebel guerrillas in Cuba's Oriente Province have opened a second front against Batista's army. The area controlled by the troops led by Raúl Castro, the brother of rebel leader Castro, already includes the cities of Baracoa, Yateras, Guantánamo, Alto Songo, North San Luis, as well as parts of Mayarí and Sagua de Tánamo. Throughout this vast land, except for a few isolated cities, all are under the control of the rebels, including some sugar industry centers.

The article wrote: The rebels have established judicial institutions in the entire important area under their control, paid attention to public education, and banned gambling. Regarding the judiciary, they have a group of lawyers and judges who conduct trials for theft, rape, and against informers and lackeys, and make corresponding judgments on each case. As for public education, the rebels have ensured that schools open normally, improve school conditions, and protect them as much as possible when the government air force carries out sinful bombings, or repair the damage caused by the bombings.

Argentina

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Buenos Aires News: According to the Argentine "Times," the Argentine Communist Party issued a statement on the message about the oil problem issued by Argentine President Frondizi. The statement pointed out that only by reorganizing the entire national economy and getting rid of the control of foreign monopoly capital can Argentina's economy achieve independent development.

In a message issued on July 24, Frondizi said that foreign dependence in terms of fuel and steel has become Argentina's "main obstacle to progress" and "puts Argentina's sovereignty in danger."

The Argentine Communist Party issued a statement on July 25, saying that according to the President's message, the problem seems to be that Argentina's economic crisis and its economic dependence on imperialist powers are caused by spending a lot of money to import oil. In fact, the basic problem of oil is a consequence of the deepest roots. This root is the backward economic structure based on large landlord ownership and foreign capital that monopolizes the lifeblood of Argentina's national economy.

The statement pointed out, when talking about Frondizi's plan to solve the oil problem, that the Argentine Communist Party opposes "this plan that serves the imperialist company" and believes that it is an "illusion" to expect the most predatory U.S. oil monopoly capital to help an economically backward country gain independence.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: New York News: The U.S. "Worker's Weekly" published an Argentine communication on the 24th, which reported on the enthusiastic celebration by the Argentine laboring people of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Argentine Communist Party. The Argentine Communist Party was established in 1918.

The communication said that the celebration was not limited to large-scale mass rallies, picnics, and thousands of gatherings held in halls and private residences, but the party also launched a campaign to absorb 100,000 new members and raise one million pesos (equivalent to 300,000 U.S. dollars) in funding.

The communication pointed out that since the Argentine democratic forces won a huge victory in the parliamentary general election in February this year, the democratic wave has risen on all fronts. Therefore, the Argentine Communist Party is now in a more favorable condition than ever before to carry out the campaign to absorb new members and raise funds.

The communication also said that the Argentine Communist Party combines fundraising with a wide-ranging publicity campaign to the masses on the domestic and international political situation and the party's policies.

Chile

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 25th: The Swiss "Worker's Voice" published a telegram from its reporter Jouvet from Santiago on the 21st, reporting on a conversation between the General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, Luis Corvalán, and Jouvet after the Chilean Congress passed the abolition of the reactionary "Law for the Defense of Democracy."

The "Law for the Defense of Democracy" is a reactionary law that persecutes the Chilean Communist Party and puts it in an illegal position. After a long struggle by the Chilean Communist Party and other democratic parties, this law was abolished on August 2 this year, and the Chilean Communist Party regained its legal status.

Corvalán, who was forced to engage in underground activities for ten years, said: As early as the end of 1948, when President González Videla promulgated this law, the party expressed confidence that its rights would one day be restored.

He said: "We have fought for ten years. We encountered great difficulties at first, but when the vast majority of our people realized that the suppression of active workers and the suppression of the Communist Party was part of the policy of carrying out the Cold War and subordinating our country to the U.S. war plan, our struggle grew stronger and achieved greater and greater success."

Reporter Jouvet wrote in the report: After this "law spurned by everyone" was abolished, the Chilean Communist Party and all democratic forces in the country felt encouraged. He said: This great victory has strengthened the campaign of the People's Action Front candidates (Editor's note: Chile will elect a new president on September 4. The People's Action Front, including the Chilean Communist Party, the Socialist Party and other left-wing parties, supports the General Secretary of the Socialist Party, Allende, as a candidate). Hundreds of thousands of communists who were arbitrarily removed from the voter list will be able to register on the voter list and exercise their right to vote. But more importantly, the victory has created an enthusiastic atmosphere among the people.

Mexico

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: TASS, New York, August 26th: The strike of more than 100,000 Mexican railway workers protesting against the railway authorities' sabotage of trade union law has ended victoriously. Workers' leaders and the government have signed a contract which, in addition to stipulating that workers resume work, also stipulates that all striking workers be paid wages for the entire strike period, that repression against striking workers be stopped, etc., and also stipulates that new elections be held in the railway workers' union.

The news said that the leading body of the Mexican Railway Workers' Union recently held elections in Mexico City. According to preliminary materials, supporters of the union leader Demetrio Vallejo, who was previously not recognized by the Mexican Ministry of Labor, won, obtaining more than 50% of the votes.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Mexico City News: In Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, university students have gone on strike to protest the increase in bus fares. On the 23rd, students seized dozens of buses, bringing traffic in the city to a standstill.

Bolivia

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: TASS, New York, August 26th: According to news from La Paz, the strike by Bolivian railway employees demanding wage increases has continued for two weeks. Although the government announced two days ago that it was willing to resolve the conflict with the strike leaders, the local union organization of railway employees at Oruro, a major railway hub, announced that it would continue the strike. As a result, railway traffic with Argentina and Chile remains paralyzed.

Peru

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: TASS, New York, August 26th: According to Washington news from various news agencies, Peruvian Ambassador Berckemeyer handed a note to the U.S. Secretary of State. The note said that the U.S. Tariff Commission's decision to increase import duties on lead and zinc made Peru "deeply disturbed."

The ambassador said when submitting the note that "any increase in import duties on lead and zinc would bring losses to our country. Even if the United States does not increase tariffs, our country has already experienced a large deficit in the trade balance due to the low prices of lead, zinc and other materials."

　　拉丁美洲的土地在沸腾
　　古巴起义军越战越强控制广大农村　阿根廷共产党要求政府摆脱美国垄断资本控制　智利民主力量欢呼共产党取得合法地位　墨西哥铁路工人罢工获得胜利　玻利维亚铁路工人坚持罢工斗争　秘鲁政府反对美国提高铅锌进口税
　　古巴
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约26日讯：“纽约时报”发表的一篇评论古巴国内战争的社论说，巴蒂斯塔政府建立的严格的书报检查制度长期地蒙蔽了这个事实：它的军队不断遭到失败，而卡斯特罗的军队则越战越强。
    文章说，尽管有这种严格的检查，现在真相还是透露出来了。在奥连特和卡马圭两个东部省份里，古巴起义者控制了广大的农村，而政府军只是集中在那些有卫戍部队保护的城市里。
    据新华社26日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭“人民报”不久前转载了古巴起义部队发行的“大陆新闻”的一篇文章，其中报道了古巴起义斗争蓬勃开展的情况。
    文章首先指出，古巴奥连特省的起义军游击队已经开辟了反对巴蒂斯塔军队的第二条战线。起义军领袖卡斯特罗的兄弟拉乌尔·卡斯特罗所领导的部队控制的地区已经包括巴拉科阿、亚泰拉斯、关塔那摩、阿耳托桑戈等市、北圣路易市以及马亚里和萨瓜德塔那摩等市的一部分。在整个这片广大土地上，除了几个孤立的城市以外，全部都在起义者的控制之下，其中包括一些糖业中心。
    文章写道：起义者在他们所控制的整个这个重要的地区里，建立了司法机构，注意了公共教育并且禁绝了赌博。关于司法，他们拥有一批律师和审判人员，这些人进行对盗窃案、强奸案以及对告密者和狗腿子的审判，并且对每一个案件作出相应的判决。至于公共教育，起义者做到了使学校正常开课，改善学校条件，并且在政府空军进行罪恶的轰炸时尽可能保护它们，或者修复轰炸所造成的破坏。
　　阿根廷
    据新华社26日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：据阿根廷“时报”报道，阿根廷共产党就阿根廷总统弗朗迪西发表的关于石油问题的文告发表了声明。声明指出，只有改组整个国民经济和摆脱外国垄断资本的控制，才能使阿根廷的经济得到独立的发展。
    弗朗迪西在7月24日发表的文告中说，在燃料和钢的方面对外国的依赖已经成为阿根廷“进步的主要障碍”，“并且把阿根廷的主权置于危险的境地”。
    阿根廷共产党在7月25日对此发表声明说，根据总统的文告，问题好像是，阿根廷的经济危机和它在经济上对帝国主义大国的依附是因为花很多钱进口石油而引起的。实际上石油的基本问题是最深刻根源的一个后果。这个根源就是以大地主所有制为基础的落后的经济结构和垄断了阿根廷国民经济命脉的外国资本。
    声明在谈到弗朗迪西提出的解决石油问题的计划时指出，阿根廷共产党反对“这个以帝国主义公司为本国服务的计划”，认为指望最富掠夺性的美国石油垄断资本会帮助一个经济落后的国家获得独立是“幻想”。
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”24日刊载了一篇阿根廷通讯，其中报道了阿根廷劳动人民热情庆祝阿根廷共产党建党四十周年的情况。阿根廷共产党是在1918年建立的。
    通讯说，庆祝的方式不仅限于大规模的群众集会、野餐以及在大厅内和私人住宅中举行的成千次聚会，而且党还展开了吸收十万名新党员和募集一百万比索（相当于三十万美元）经费的运动。
    通讯指出，自从阿根廷民主力量在今年2月的议会普选中获得巨大胜利以来，民主浪潮在各个战线上都高涨起来。因此，阿根廷共产党目前开展吸收新党员和募集经费的运动比以往任何时候都具备更加有利的条件。
    通讯还说，阿根廷共产党把募集经费同对群众进行一次有关国内外政治形势和党的政策的广泛宣传运动结合起来。
　　智利
    据新华社日内瓦25日电　瑞士“工人之声报”21日刊载了该报记者儒瓦从圣地亚哥发回的电讯，报道智利共产党总书记路易斯·科尔巴兰在智利国会通过废除反动的“保卫民主法”以后向儒瓦发表的谈话。
    “保卫民主法”是迫害智利共产党使它处于非法地位的反动法律。在经过智利共产党和其他民主党派长期斗争以后，这个法律在今年8月2日被废除，从此智利共产党恢复了合法地位。
    被迫十年来从事地下活动的科尔巴兰说：早在1948年年底，当总统冈萨雷斯·魏地拉颁布了这一法律的时候，党就表示有信心：它的权利总有一天会恢复。
    他说：“我们斗争了十年。最初遇到很大的困难，但是当我国绝大多数人民了解到对工人积极分子的镇压、对共产党的镇压，是进行冷战并使我们国家从属于美国战争计划的政策的一部分时，我们的斗争便日益壮大，并且获得愈来愈大的成就。”
    记者儒瓦在报道中写道：这个“众人唾弃的法律”被废弃以后，智利共产党以及国内所有民主力量都感到欢欣鼓舞。他说：这个伟大的胜利已经加强了人民行动阵线候选人的竞选运动（编者按：9月4日智利将选举新总统。包括智利共产党、社会党等左翼党派的人民行动阵线支持社会党总书记阿伦德为候选人）。被专横地从选民单上取消的成千上万的共产党人就将能在选民册上登记并行使自己的选举权。但是更为重要的是这次胜利在人民群众中形成的热情气氛。
　　墨西哥
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约26日讯：十万多墨西哥铁路员工为抗议铁路当局破坏工会法而举行的罢工胜利结束。工人领袖和政府已签订了一项合同，除了规定工人复工之外，还规定发给全体罢工工人在整个罢工期间的工资，停止对罢工工人进行镇压等，并且还规定了在铁路员工工会中举行新的选举。
    消息说，墨西哥铁路员工工会领导机构最近已经在墨西哥城举行了选举。据初步材料，墨西哥劳工部以前所不承认的工会领袖迪米特里奥·瓦耶霍的拥护者获得了胜利，他们取得了50％以上的选票。
    据新华社27日讯　墨西哥城消息：在墨西哥的首都墨西哥城，大学生们为了抗议公共汽车票价上涨举行了罢课。23日，学生们夺取了数十辆公共汽车，使市内的交通陷于停顿状态。
　　玻利维亚
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社纽约26日讯：据来自拉巴斯的消息报道，玻利维亚铁路员工要求提高工资的罢工已经继续两周了。虽然两天以前，政府曾宣布愿意同罢工领袖解决冲突，但是巨大铁路枢纽站奥路罗铁路员工地方工会组织宣布继续罢工。因此，同阿根廷和智利的铁路交通仍然陷于瘫痪状态。
　　秘鲁
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约26日讯：各通讯社的华盛顿消息说，秘鲁大使贝肯梅尔交给美国国务卿一份照会。照会说，美国关税委员会关于增加铅和锌的进口税的决定使秘鲁“深感不安”。
    大使在递交照会时说，“铅和锌的进口税作任何增加都会给我国带来损失，即使美国不增加关税，我国在贸易差额上已经由于铅、锌和其他物资的价格低微而出现了很大的逆差”。
