Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th August: Chairman Mao Zedong inspected rural Henan from August 6th to 8th.

Chairman Mao inspected the commune-run industries and cotton fields of the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang County; the tobacco and millet planted by the Liangzhuang and Xueyuan agricultural cooperatives in Xiangcheng County; the cornfields of the "May Fourth" agricultural cooperative in Changge County; and the sweet potatoes and rice planted by the Zhonghua agricultural cooperative in Daokou Township, Shangqiu County. When Chairman Mao inspected these places, cadres and the masses warmly cheered Chairman Mao and eagerly reported on the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the great agricultural harvest. Chairman Mao had cordial conversations with the masses during his inspection. Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Henan Province, Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shi Xiangsheng, and responsible comrades from relevant prefectural, county, and township party committees accompanied Chairman Mao on the inspection.

On the afternoon of the 6th, Chairman Mao arrived in Qiliying Township, Xinxiang County. The people here, following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, had already established the Qiliying People's Commune on the basis of agricultural cooperation throughout the township. Chairman Mao inquired about the situation of the commune and visited the commune's nursery, "House of Happiness," canteen, flour mill, and ball bearing factory. He also went to the fields to observe the growth of cotton. Chairman Mao shook hands and talked with the elderly people living a happy life in their later years in the "House of Happiness." At the ball bearing factory, Chairman Mao carefully observed the process of producing ball bearings using indigenous methods. He greatly praised the small factory for producing more than 5,000 ball bearings in two days. Chairman Mao was particularly pleased with the boundless cotton fields, where the cotton grew exceptionally well. Chairman Mao walked up to the female commune members who were spraying pesticide in the cotton field and suggested, "Show me how it's done." Six female commune members happily gave Chairman Mao a demonstration. Chairman Mao walked into the shoulder-high cotton field, where cotton bolls grew in clusters on the fruit branches, and he repeatedly praised the cotton for growing well. Chairman Mao came out of the cotton field and asked the commune cadres, "How much cotton is like this?" Commune Director Wang Wensheng said, "The Qiliying production team has 10,500 mu, and more than 5,000 mu are like this. We guarantee 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu and strive for 2,000 jin." Chairman Mao smiled and said to Wu Zhipu, "Secretary Wu, there is hope! It would be great if all of Henan were like this." Wu Zhipu said, "With one such commune, there is no worry that there won't be more such communes." Chairman Mao said, "That's right! With one such commune, there will be many more."

In Liangzhuang agricultural cooperative and Xueyuan agricultural cooperative in Shili Pu Township, Xiangcheng County, Chairman Mao observed the growth of tobacco and millet. The Yunnan multi-leaf tobacco planted here has grown to be more than one person tall, with more than 70 leaves per plant, and each mu is planned to produce 30,000 jin. Chairman Mao happily walked into the tobacco field, carefully observed the growth of the tobacco, and asked Zhang Fude, the party branch secretary of the Liangzhuang agricultural cooperative, and others in detail about the planting and harvesting of tobacco.

At the "May Fourth" agricultural cooperative in Changge County, Chairman Mao observed the well-grown stubble corn. There are 40 mu of densely planted stubble corn here, which has grown to be more than six chi tall, with a planned yield of 20,000 jin per mu. Another nearby experimental field of cadre corn is growing even better, with a planned yield of 25,000 jin per mu. Chairman Mao praised this well-grown corn. Chairman Mao asked the county party secretary, Lü Bingguang, about this year's output. Lü Bingguang said, "We guarantee 1,500 jin and strive for 2,000 jin." Chairman Mao smiled and asked, "Can you achieve it?" Lü Bingguang said with confidence, "We will definitely achieve it. We will report the good news to Chairman in Beijing after the autumn harvest."

At the "July 1st" experimental station of the Zhonghua agricultural cooperative in Daokou Township, Shangqiu County, Chairman Mao saw two kinds of experimental sweet potatoes, those with vines trellised and those without, as well as the rice that the cooperative was trying to grow for the first time, and he expressed his satisfaction with the growth of these crops. When Chairman Mao saw sorghum, he asked, "Have you planted multi-headed sorghum?" Ren Xiuduo, the Second Secretary of the Shangqiu Prefectural Committee, replied that many places had planted this kind of sorghum. Chairman Mao said, "This kind of sorghum has a high yield."

Chairman Mao left Henan after inspecting rural Henan for three days. Chairman Mao's inspection has brought great encouragement and unparalleled strength to the people of Henan. The people of all regions are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's concern with even greater achievements. The agricultural cooperatives that Chairman Mao inspected have revised their production plans and are determined to strive for even greater harvests.

    毛主席视察河南农村
　　连声称赞人民公社棉花长得好：“有这样一个社，就会有好多社。”
    新华社郑州11日电　毛泽东主席在8月6日到8日视察了河南农村。
    毛主席在河南省视察了新乡县七里营人民公社的社办工业和棉田；襄城县梁庄、薛元等农业社种植的烟叶和谷子；长葛县“五四”农业社的玉米田和商丘县道口乡中华农业社种植的红薯和稻子。当毛主席在这些地方视察的时候，干部和群众都向毛主席热烈欢呼，并且争着向毛主席报告农业社发展、巩固的情况和农业大丰收的情况。毛主席在视察时同群众进行了亲切的谈话。陪同毛主席进行视察的有中共河南省委第一书记、河南省省长吴芝圃，中共河南省省委书记处书记杨蔚屏、史向生以及有关地、县、乡的党委负责同志。
    6日下午，毛主席到达新乡县七里营乡。这里的人民按照毛主席指示的道路，已经在全乡农业合作化的基础上建立了七里营人民公社。毛主席询问了这个公社的情况，并且参观了这个公社的托儿所、“幸福院”、食堂、面粉加工厂、滚珠轴承厂，又到田间观看了棉花的生长情况。毛主席和在“幸福院”里过着晚年幸福生活的老年人握手，并且谈了话。在滚珠轴承厂里，毛主席详细地观看了用土法生产滚珠轴承的过程，他对这个小工厂在两天时间里就生产出五千多滚珠极为称赞。毛主席对于田间一望无际长得特别好的棉花感到特别高兴。毛主席走到正在棉花地里喷射杀虫药剂的女社员面前提议说：“作作给我看看”，六个女社员兴高彩烈地给毛主席作了表演。毛主席走进了齐肩高的棉花地，棉花的果枝上棉桃成串，他连声称赞棉花长得好。毛主席从棉花地里走出来向社干部说：“像这样的棉花有多少”？社长王文生说：“七里营生产队一万零五百亩，有五千多亩是这样的。每亩保证皮棉一千斤，争取两千斤。”毛主席笑着向吴芝圃说：“吴书记，有希望啊！　你们河南都像这样就好了。”吴芝圃说：“有这么一个社就不愁有更多这样的社”，毛主席说：“对！有这样一个社，就会有好多社”。
    毛主席在襄城县的梁庄农业社、十里铺乡薛元农业社等地观看了烟叶和谷子生长的情况。这里种的云南多叶烟，已经长到一人多高，每棵有七十多个叶，每亩计划产三万斤。毛主席高兴地走到烟叶地里，仔细地观看了烟叶的生长情况，并向梁庄农业社的党支部书记张富德等详细询问了烟叶的种植和收获等方面的问题。
    在长葛县“五四”农业社，毛主席观看了长得很好的麦茬玉米。这里有四十亩密植麦茬玉米，已经长到六尺多高，计划亩产两万斤，附近的另一块干部玉米试验田长得更好，计划亩产两万五千斤。毛主席称赞了这些生长良好的玉米。毛主席问县委书记吕炳光今年的产量，吕炳光说：“保证一千五百斤，争取两千斤。”毛主席笑着问：“能达到吗？”吕炳光满怀信心地说：“一定达到，秋后到北京给主席报喜。”
    在商丘县道口乡中华农业社“七一”试验站，毛主席看到了架秧和不架秧的两种试验红薯以及这个社第一次试种的水稻，并且对这些作物生长的情况表示满意。毛主席看到高粱的时候，就问：“有没有种多头高粱？”商丘地委第二书记任秀铎回答说，有许多地方种了这种高粱。毛主席说：“这种高粱产量高。”
    毛主席在河南农村视察了三天后已经离开河南。毛主席这次视察给河南人民带来了巨大的鼓舞和无比的力量，各地人民决心以更大的成就来回答毛主席的关怀。毛主席视察过的农业社都修订了生产计划，决心争取更大的丰收。（图片）
