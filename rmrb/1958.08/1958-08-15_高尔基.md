    The working class, in order to understand the immense significance of its achievements and its economic successes, must understand the past, must understand the desolate and chaotic foundation on which it began to build a new country. Everything must be understood through comparison, and therefore, in order to correctly evaluate the present, one must understand the past. Currently, there are many among us who are completely unaware of the past's life of hard labor, and therefore cannot correctly evaluate the present.
          —Gorky

    工人阶级为了了解自己的成果和自己的经济成就的巨大意义，就必须了解过去，就必须了解他开始建设新国家时那个荒芜杂乱的基础。一切都要从比较中去了解，因此，为了正确地评价现在，就必须了解过去。目前我们中间就有不少这样的人，他们全然不知道过去苦役般的生活，因而也就不能正确地评价现在。
          ——高尔基
