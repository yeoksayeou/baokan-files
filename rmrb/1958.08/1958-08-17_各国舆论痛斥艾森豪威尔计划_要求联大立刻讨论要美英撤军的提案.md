Xinhua News Agency dispatch: International opinion continues to comment on the United Nations General Assembly emergency session, widely criticizing Eisenhower's attempt to conceal his aggressive crimes and his deceptive plan. They believe that the UN General Assembly emergency session should immediately discuss the proposal for the withdrawal of US and British troops.

    Lebanon
    Lebanese opposition leader Yafi, when talking about Eisenhower's so-called "peace plan," said: "The six points suggested by Eisenhower to elaborate on the Middle East plan are nothing new. These things have been discussed before. These suggestions contain nothing new except the so-called international guarantees for Lebanon and Jordan. However, small countries participating in the United Nations itself entitle them to such guarantees, guaranteeing their independence and sovereignty from infringement. The United Nations has no right to interfere in the Lebanese uprising. Furthermore, the United Nations Charter also prohibits such interference."
    Beirut's "Al Anwar" published an editorial on the 15th saying: "We oppose the Eisenhower Plan, just as we opposed the Eisenhower Doctrine before."

    United Arab Republic
    Cairo's "Al Shaab" said that Eisenhower's plan is an attempt to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from fulfilling its responsibility to demand the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East. The newspaper pointed out that the Arab people firmly demand that the United Nations fulfill its responsibility, order the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East region, and allow the people of Lebanon and Jordan to decide their own future.
    A commentator on Cairo Radio condemned Eisenhower's six-point plan on the afternoon of the 15th, saying that this plan concentrates all the West's despicable plans for the Middle East—such as Eden's statement on the Middle East in the British House of Commons in 1954, the Johnston Plan, and the Eisenhower and Dulles plans. The only new thing in the Eisenhower Plan is this: the United States is trying to force the United Nations to do what the United States and its allies have not been able to do, to save imperialism's interests in the region.
    Damascus' "Al Nour" said: Eisenhower's entire plan is based on proving the United States "has the right" to oppose Arab nationalism and stop its progress in order to destroy the Arab liberation movement, based on the untenable and fictitious pretext of so-called "indirect aggression."
    The newspaper added that the most serious danger of the Eisenhower Plan is to divert people's attention from the main source of the escalating tension and threat of war in the Middle East.

    Iraq
    Iraqi newspapers all published editorials criticizing Eisenhower's speech at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, pointing out that Eisenhower's plan is another deceptive trick.
    "Al Bilad" said: "Eisenhower's suggestion to send a UN police force to the Middle East is to support Hussein and Chamoun. Eisenhower wants to stifle the free voice of Arab radio stations and wants to use the power of the United Nations to oppose the freedom and independence of Arab countries."
    Iraqi Republic Radio commented on the debate on the Middle East issue at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly on the 15th, saying that Iraq fully supports and respects the Soviet proposal to withdraw US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.
    The commentary said that Eisenhower's plan, whether in its entirety or in its details, is completely unworthy of any support or discussion from us. The commentary refuted Eisenhower's six-point plan point by point.
    The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower's proposal to establish a permanent international inspection of Middle Eastern radio stations is a means adopted by imperialists to stifle the patriotic enthusiasm of the Arab people and the growing awakening of the Arab people, and to oppose free thought there. The commentary pointed out that the United States and Britain themselves have established many radio stations for the above-mentioned purposes to spread the poison of their ulterior motives of colonial propaganda. Let the imperialists first stop the rumors and slanders of their radio stations! They have no right to demand to inspect our radio stations that only tell the truth and reflect our nation's desire for independence, freedom, and liberation!

    Indonesia
    Some newspapers in Jakarta condemned US President Eisenhower's speech at the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly and continued to demand the withdrawal of US and British invading troops from the Middle East.
    "Sin Po" criticized Eisenhower's plan on the 15th, saying that the United States is trying to force the United Nations to recognize its military aggression in the Middle East as "legal." The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower's economic plan also has a similar purpose.

    India
    India's "National Herald" sharply pointed out in an editorial on the 15th that sending so-called "peace forces" to West Asia "will make the machinery of intervention more complete." The editorial said that if the demand for the complete withdrawal of US and British troops cannot be realized, it is tantamount to succumbing to blackmail.
    "The Statesman" published a commentary on the 15th saying that the American plan is unacceptable to India. "Hindustan Standard" said, "India opposes sending any UN troops to Lebanon or Jordan to replace the troops of the United States and Britain."

    Japan
    Japanese public opinion expressed dissatisfaction with the US attitude expressed by US President Eisenhower in his speech at the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that the US President's speech is a trick to divert world opinion from the illegal invasion of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British troops. The newspaper emphasized that the UN General Assembly session should resolve the Middle East crisis caused by the entry of Western countries' troops into Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper said that the US President's plan cannot promote the realization of this task, and this plan can only divert people from the main goal. The newspaper believes that the Eisenhower Plan does not conform to the mission and spirit of the times.
    Japanese newspapers, some social groups, and individuals have demanded that the Japanese representatives attending the UN General Assembly session advocate the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. "Asahi Shimbun" directly pointed out that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan is the primary task, and the Japanese delegation should strive to achieve this at the emergency meeting.

    各国舆论痛斥艾森豪威尔计划
    要求联大立刻讨论要美英撤军的提案
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续评论联合国大会紧急会议，纷纷抨击艾森豪威尔企图掩饰侵略罪行的手法和他所提出的欺骗性计划，并认为联合国大会紧急会议应该立即讨论要美英撤退侵略军队的提案。
    黎巴嫩
    黎巴嫩反对党领袖雅菲在谈到艾森豪威尔的所谓“和平计划”时说：“艾森豪威尔企图用来阐明中近东计划的六点建议不是什么新东西。这些东西以前就谈过了。在这些建议里除了要求给予黎巴嫩和约旦所谓国际保障之外，不包含任何新东西。但是小国参加联合国的本身就使他们有权取得这种保障，保障他们的独立和主权不受侵犯。联合国无权干涉黎巴嫩的起义运动。此外，联合国宪章也禁止这种干涉”。
    贝鲁特“晚报”15日发表社论说：“我们反对艾森豪威尔计划，正如我们以前反对艾森豪威尔主义一样。”
    阿联
    开罗“人民报”说，艾森豪威尔的计划是企图使联合国大会不去履行它要求美英军队立即撤出中东的责任。这家报纸指出，阿拉伯人民坚决要求联合国履行它的责任，命令外国军队立即撤出中东地区，让黎巴嫩和约旦的人民自己来决定他们的前途。
    开罗电台评论员15日下午谴责艾森豪威尔的六点计划说，这个计划把西方对中东的全部卑鄙的计划——例如艾登1954年在英国下议院发表的关于中东的声明，约翰斯顿计划以及艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的计划等——都集中起来了。艾森豪威尔计划中的唯一的新东西是这样：美国正在设法迫使联合国去干美国和它的盟国所没有能够做到的事情，来挽救帝国主义在这个地区的利益。
    大马士革“光明报”说：艾森豪威尔的全部计划的基础是：根据不能成立的和虚构的所谓“间接侵略”的借口，证明美国“有权”反对阿拉伯民族主义和阻止它的进展，以摧毁阿拉伯的解放运动。
    这家报纸又说，艾森豪威尔计划中最严重的危险是分散人们对于中东紧张局势和战争威胁加剧的主要根源的注意。
    伊拉克
    伊拉克报纸都发表社论抨击艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急会议的演说，它们指出，艾森豪威尔的计划是又一个骗人的把戏。
      “国家报”说：“艾森豪威尔关于联合国派警察部队到中东去的建议是为了支持侯赛因和夏蒙。艾森豪威尔想要扼制阿拉伯广播电台的自由的声音，并且想利用联合国的力量来反对阿拉伯国家的自由和独立。”
    伊拉克共和国电台15日就联合国大会紧急会议上关于中东问题的辩论发表评论说，伊拉克完全支持和尊重苏联要求从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出美英军队的提案。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔的计划无论就其整体和细节来看，完全不值得我们表示任何支持或讨论。评论逐点驳斥了艾森豪威尔的六点计划。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔提出的要对中东各广播电台建立常设的国际检查，是帝国主义者为了扼杀阿拉伯人民的爱国主义热情和日益增长的阿拉伯人民的觉醒以及为了反对那里的自由思想而采取的手段。评论指出，美国和英国自己为了上述目的设立了许多电台来散播它们别有用心的殖民主义宣传的毒素。让帝国主义者首先制止它们的电台的造谣和诬蔑吧！它们无权要求检查我们的只说实话并且反映我们民族的争取独立、自由和解放的愿望的电台！
    印度尼西亚
    雅加达的一些报纸谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急特别会议上的演说，并且继续要求美英侵略军队从中东撤退。
    “东星报”15日抨击艾森豪威尔的计划说，美国企图强迫联合国承认它在中东的军事侵略是“合法”的。报纸指出，艾森豪威尔的经济计划也有着类似的目的。
    印度
    印度“国民先驱报”15日在社论中尖锐地指出，派所谓“和平部队”到西亚去“将使干涉的机器更趋完整”。社论说，假如要美英两国军队全部撤退的要求不能实现，那就等于是向讹诈手段屈膝。
    “政治家报”15日发表评论说，美国的方案是印度无法接受的。“印度斯坦旗报”说，“印度反对派遣任何联合国军队到黎巴嫩或约旦去替换美英两国的军队。”
    日本
    日本公众舆论对美国总统艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急特别会议上的演说中所表达的美国对这次会议的态度表示不满。
      “读卖新闻”认为，美国总统的演说是一个花招，企图转移世界舆论对美英军队非法侵入黎巴嫩和约旦这一事件的注意。这家报纸强调指出，联大这次会议应当解决由于西方国家军队开入黎巴嫩和约旦所产生的中东危机。这家报纸说，美国总统的计划不能促进实现这一任务，这个计划只能使人脱离主要目标。这家报纸认为，艾森豪威尔计划不符合时代任务和精神。
    日本报纸、一些社会团体和个人都要求出席联大会议的日本代表主张美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。“朝日新闻”直接指出，外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦是首要任务，日本代表团在紧急会议上应争取做到这点。
