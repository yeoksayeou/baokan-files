    Air Transport of Sweet Potato Seedlings
    Our county decided to plant 60,000 mu of sweet potatoes this year. Most of the seedlings were purchased from agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing and were transported to our county starting in early July. After July 12th, continuous rainy days made it impossible to transport them by road, so we went to the Civil Aviation Administration and requested their assistance with air transport. They readily agreed and immediately dispatched an aircraft to airdrop the seedlings.
    Because there were too many seedlings, one aircraft was not enough. Starting from the 21st, they proactively added four more aircraft to participate in the air transport, and increased the number of daily flights from four to seven. With the strong support of all the comrades of the Civil Aviation Administration, we were able to plant the sweet potato seedlings in a timely manner.
    We are determined to achieve the production targets proposed by our county in agricultural production: "crossing the Yellow River in one year and surpassing the Yangtze River in three years," to thank the enthusiastic support of the comrades of the Civil Aviation Administration.

    飞机运送薯秧
    我县决定今年栽种六万亩白薯，大部分薯秧是在北京郊区各农业社买的，从7月初开始陆续往本县运。7月12日以后，连日阴雨，公路上不能运输，我们就去找民航局，请求他们协助空运。他们慨然答应，立刻调动了一架飞机空投薯秧。
    因为薯秧太多，一架飞机运不过来，从21日起，他们又主动增加了四架飞机参加空运，并由原来每天起飞四次增加到七次。在民航局全体同志的大力支援下，使我们能够及时地把白薯秧栽好。
    我们决心实现我县在农业生产上所提出的一年跨黄河三年过长江的增产指标。来感谢民航局同志的热情支援。
