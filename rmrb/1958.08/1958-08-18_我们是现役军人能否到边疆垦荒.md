    We are Active Duty Soldiers
    Can We Reclaim Wasteland in the Border Areas?
    After reading the "Reader Q&A: What Conditions Must Volunteers Meet and What Procedures Must They Follow to Reclaim Wasteland in the Border Areas?" published on page 4 of the People's Daily on June 30th, I was very happy, but I don't know if active duty soldiers can go to the border areas to reclaim wasteland? Can we go to the border areas to reclaim wasteland after our military service expires in the future? Please tell us.

Li Faxiang and Chen Jiliang comrades:
    Regarding the question you raised about active duty soldiers participating in border area reclamation, after contacting relevant departments, active duty soldiers cannot participate in border area reclamation work during their service. As for soldiers who volunteer to participate in border area reclamation work after retiring from active service, the procedures can be handled in the same way as for the general public.

    我们是现役军人
    能否到边疆垦荒
    我看了6月30日人民日报第四版发表“志愿到边疆垦荒的人要具备那些条件和办理什么手续？”的答读者问后，心里很高兴，但我不知道现役军人是否能去边疆垦荒？将来服兵役期满后，是否能去边疆垦荒？请你们告诉我吧。

          李发祥、陈记良李发祥、陈记良同志：
    你们提出关于现役军人参加边疆垦荒的问题，经与有关部门联系，现役军人在服役期间，不能参加边疆垦荒工作。至于军人退出现役后，志愿参加边疆垦荒工作，其手续可与一般人民群众同样办理。
