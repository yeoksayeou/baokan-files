    Fusong County, Rich in Ginseng,
    Establishes Baishan Amateur Ginseng University
    (Xinhua News Agency) Fusong County, Jilin Province, which is rich in ginseng, recently established a "Baishan Amateur Ginseng University" in response to the needs of developing ginseng production in the Changbai Mountains area.
    This university was jointly founded by the Fusong County No. 1 State-owned Ginseng Farm and the Baishan Ginseng Industry Cooperative of Donggang Township, using the original buildings of the ginseng farm. The first group of forty-five male and female students admitted are mostly ginseng cooperative members and workers who are politically progressive, actively working, and have a high school education or equivalent to a high school education, and have undergone more than one year of practical labor training. Within three years, they will study eight courses, including political courses, soil science, ginseng cultivation, ginseng physiology, ginseng pathology, ginseng insects, ginseng selection, and ginseng processing.
