Who Says Building a Furnace is Easy, but Producing Iron is Hard?
By our reporter Xiao Ming

    The furnace construction work in Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, basically came to an end at the end of July. As of August 24, of the 856 blast furnaces built in the county, 813 had been put into production, of which 766 were normally producing molten iron, with a daily output of 250 tons of iron for the entire county.

    Why was Jinsha County able to overcome difficulties and produce iron so quickly? What were the main experiences of the county party committee in leading this work?

    Leadership Takes the Lead, Breaking Through Barriers

    The success of iron smelting in Jinsha County also went through a period of exploration. In July, various districts conducted iron smelting experiments, but few were successful and many failed. Some workers complained that "the smokeless coal ate the molten iron," and some places even used all charcoal but still couldn't smelt iron; some places succeeded in small furnaces, but it didn't work in large furnaces. The county party committee found two places to hold on-site meetings, but when everyone arrived, the furnaces couldn't produce iron. At that time, the county party committee studied the situation in the county and, on the one hand, called on cadres in various districts and townships not to be afraid of failure and to repeatedly and persistently conduct experiments; on the other hand, it decided that the county party committee would personally conduct experimental furnaces to learn from experience, train cadres, and learn skills. At the beginning of August, the county party committee concentrated most of the industrial cadres in the county and conducted continuous experiments in Bajiao Township, Jinjiagou, and Yankong Township. When they failed, they discussed the reasons why iron could not be smelted with some old furnace masters on the spot; when they succeeded, they summarized the successful experiences. In this experiment, the cadres ate at the blast furnace, slept at the blast furnace, moved bricks, carried soil, added fire, and transported materials. From practical operation, they summarized a series of experiences in various processes such as furnace lining, material selection, batching, blowing, and watching fire color. Then, an on-site meeting of industrial cadres in the county was held, so that cadres in charge of industry could learn a complete set of technical knowledge and management methods from actual production. Since then, the situation of iron production in Jinsha County has shown a new situation, with new records every day, and dozens of blast furnaces being put into production, emitting green smoke and flowing molten iron. Advanced experiences continue to emerge.

    Grasping Both the Advanced and the Backward

    At this time, the county party committee, on the one hand, gave red flags to advanced areas, promoted advanced experiences, held on-site meetings in advanced areas, and organized the entire team from other areas to learn technology in advanced areas. On the other hand, it also paid attention to backward areas. Santunyan in Pingba District relied on water and mines and built twenty blast furnaces in a row, concentrating more than 400 workers and cadres. They experimented repeatedly for many times but did not produce a single drop of iron. Wang Zaixin, deputy secretary of the district party committee, personally led the workers to set up two furnaces and burned them for four days. Forty to fifty thousand catties of charcoal were burned, but no iron flowed out. The workers were anxious and confused. Furnace master Wang Dayou did not pay attention to improving technology, but believed in superstition, wanting to kill chickens, burn paper, and buy incense to worship the Bodhisattva, and not allowing women to go to the furnace. Wang Zaixin was subdued by the difficulties and lost confidence. He did not study technology, nor did he carry out ideological and political work.

    Leading comrades of the county party committee led the deputy secretaries of the district party committees of three advanced areas and several old workers to Santunyan. While participating in production, they studied technology. They successively held twenty-two technical research meetings, and conducted special discussions on major issues such as furnace equipment, material relocation, batching, and production operation. At the same time, they studied the reasons why the original two furnaces here could not produce iron, and compared the experiences of advanced areas with the methods here. They also held mass meetings, activist meetings, and cadre meetings continuously to carry out political and ideological work, criticized the right-leaning conservatism of cadres, the lack of tenacious struggle in the face of difficulties, and the tendency to neglect political and ideological work. The backward and conservative ideas of the workers were also debated. The worker ranks were rectified, and individual bad elements who were dissatisfied with socialist construction and deliberately sabotaged production were eliminated. After this series of work, everyone from top to bottom put in effort and effort to produce iron. The fire was lit on the morning of the third day, and the three furnaces produced iron one after another on the morning of the fourth day.

    From this experimental process, cadres in several backward areas learned a complete set of skills and absorbed the technical experience and working methods of advanced areas. Since then, they have returned to their respective areas with full confidence and confidence to catch up with the advanced.

    Politics in Command, Breaking Through Technical Barriers

    Iron smelting technology is different from agricultural technology, and it is relatively unfamiliar to the masses and cadres. At the beginning, some people underestimated the technical nature of iron smelting, thinking that they could learn it by looking at it, just like repairing small water conservancy projects. When they encountered difficulties, they worked continuously for several days and nights or even dozens of days and nights, burning piles of fuel, but still couldn't produce iron. Some people became discouraged, thinking that blast furnace technology was too difficult to master, and said that it was easy to build a furnace but difficult to produce iron. The county party committee analyzed this ideological situation and clearly pointed out that the failure to produce iron in the blast furnace is a technical problem, but also a political problem, and technical problems must be solved through political and ideological work. The most important thing is to strengthen confidence, not be afraid of failure, and you can't catch wolves if you are reluctant to part with sheep. The county party committee also attached special importance to the use and training of technical forces, strengthened the political and ideological work of old furnace masters, and brought into play the enthusiasm of old furnace masters. At the same time, many methods were adopted: mobilizing old furnace masters to take on a large number of apprentices, running training classes, red and expert schools, etc., and training about 2,000 technical workers. Because the county party committee grasped the ideological and technical problems, the so-called barrier of building a furnace easily but producing iron with difficulty was successfully broken through.

    At present, the county party committee is focusing on increasing the average output, striving to reach the design capacity in the short term; carrying out large-scale industrial and agricultural cooperation to ensure the sufficient supply of coal and ore; and combining technical innovation to improve production management and labor organization, so that production can gradually get on the right track.

　　谁说建炉容易出铁难？
　　本报记者　肖明
    贵州省金沙县的建炉工作，在7月底基本上告一段落。到8月24日止，这个县已建的八百五十六座高炉，有八百一十三座投入生产，其中有七百六十六座正常地流出铁水，全县日产铁二百五十吨。
    金沙县为什么能够如此迅速地突破困难炼出铁了呢？县委在领导这一工作中，有些什么主要经验呢？
    领导上阵，突破关口
    金沙县炼铁的成功也曾经历一番摸索过程。7月份，各区进行炼铁试验，结果成功的少，失败的多。一些工人吵吵说“铁水叫无烟煤给吃了”，有的地方甚至全部用木炭也炼不出铁来；有的地方在小炉上试成了，到高炉上又不灵了。县委找了两个地方开现场会议，结果人到齐了，炉子烧不出铁来。县委当时研究了全县情况，一方面号召各区、乡干部，不要怕失败，反复顽强地搞试验；另方面决定县委亲自搞试验炉，吸取经验，训练干部，学习本领。8月初县委集中了县里大部分工业干部，在八角乡、金家沟、岩孔乡连续搞试验。失败了即就地与一些老炉师研究炼不出铁的原因，成功了就总结成功的经验。这次试验，干部们都是吃在高炉，睡在高炉、搬砖、抬土、加火、运料样样都亲手干。从实际操作中，他们对搪炉、选料、配料、鼓风、看火色等各项工序都总结了一系列经验。接着又召开了全县工业干部的现场会议，使管工业的干部从实际生产中学习整套的技术知识和管理方法。从此，金沙县的高炉出铁情况出现了新的局面，每天都有新纪录，每天都有数十个高炉投入生产，冒青烟，流铁水。先进经验不断涌现。
    抓先进也抓落后
    这时候，县委一方面给先进地区插红旗，推广先进经验，到先进地区开现场会议，组织其他地区的整套人马到先进地区学习技术。另一方面也注意到落后地区。平坝区三屯岩依水靠矿，一连建成了二十座高炉，集中了四百多工人干部，反复试验了很多次都没有炼出一点铁来。区委副书记王在新亲自领着工人架起两个炉子烧了四天，炭烧了四、五万斤，铁水一点不流，工人思想焦急、混乱。炉师王大有，不注意改进技术，却相信迷信，要杀鸡、儎纸、买香敬菩萨，不许妇女上炉子。王在新被困难降住失去了信心，不钻研技术，也不进行思想政治工作。
    县委领导同志带领三个先进地区的区委副书记和几个老工人来到了三屯岩，一边参加生产，一边研究技术，他们先后召开了二十二次技术研究会，对炉子设备、迁料、配料、生产操作等主要问题都进行了专题讨论。同时，研究了这里原来两个炉子炼不出铁的原因，把先进地区的经验和这里的方法进行了对比。还连续召开群众大会、积极分子会、干部会，进行政治思想工作，批判了干部中的右倾保守，在困难面前缺乏顽强的斗争，以及忽视政治思想工作的倾向。对工人中的落后守旧思想也进行了辩论。整顿了工人队伍，清除了个别对社会主义建设心怀不满，蓄意破坏生产的坏分子。经过这一系列的工作，上上下下都为出铁水下力气用功夫。第三天早晨生起火，第四天早晨三个炉子都先后出铁了。
    从这次试验过程中，几个落后区的干部，都学到了全套本领，吸取了先进地区的技术经验和工作方法。从此，信心百倍、胸有成竹地回到本区追赶先进。
    政治挂帅，突破技术关
    炼铁技术与农业技术不同，对群众和干部都比较生疏。开始，有些人对炼铁的技术性估计不足，以为像修小水利工程一样，看看就会了，当碰到困难，一连干了几个昼夜甚至几十个昼夜，烧去成堆成堆的燃料，还流不出铁水时，有的人就有些灰心了，认为高炉技术太难掌握了，说建炉容易出铁难。县委分析了这种思想情况，明确指出：高炉炼不出铁，是技术问题，也是政治问题，必须通过政治思想工作解决技术问题。最重要的是坚定信心，不怕失败，舍不得羊就抓不住狼。县委还特别重视对技术力量的使用和培养，加强对老炉师的政治思想工作，发挥老炉师的积极性。同时，采取了许多方法：动员老炉师大量带徒弟，开办训练班、红专学校等，培养了约二千名技术工人。由于县委抓紧了思想问题和技术问题，所谓建炉容易出铁难的关口也就顺利地突破了。
    目前县委正重点抓提高平均产量，争取在短期内达到设计能力；搞工农业大协作，保证煤、矿石的充足供应；以及结合技术革新，改进生产管理和劳动组织，使生产逐步走入正轨。
