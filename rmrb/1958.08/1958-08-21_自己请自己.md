Notes

    Asking Oneself
    Eisenhower has repeatedly pretended that his dispatching troops to invade Lebanon should not be considered an invasion, because they were "invited" there.

    Who exactly invited them? Lebanese Prime Minister Sami as-Solh recently revealed this secret.

    According to the Cairo newspaper "Al-Shaab" on August 19, citing as-Solh's words, the American troop landing in Lebanon was not at the request of Camille Chamoun. He said that at the time, in order to make the landing of its troops seem legal, the United States had asked Chamoun to announce that the landing was carried out at the request of the Lebanese government...

    So that's how it is. The one who "requested" the United States to invade Lebanon was the United States itself!

    自己请自己
    艾森豪威尔一再装模作样地说，他派兵侵略黎巴嫩，似乎不能算侵略，因为这是被人家请去的呀。
    究竟是谁请去的呢？黎巴嫩总理索勒哈最近透露了这个秘密。
    据8月19日开罗“人民报”援引索勒哈的话说，美军登陆黎巴嫩并非应夏蒙的请求。他说，当时美国为了使它的军队登陆看来是合法的，曾经要求夏蒙宣布登陆是应黎巴嫩政府的请求而进行的……。
    原来如此，“请求”美国侵略黎巴嫩的就是美国自己！
