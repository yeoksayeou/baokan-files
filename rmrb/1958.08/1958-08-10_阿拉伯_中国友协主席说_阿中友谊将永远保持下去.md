Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 8th. According to the Middle East News Agency on August 8th, Hassan al-Bakuri, Chairman of the Arab-China Friendship Association and Minister of Religious Foundations, told the agency's reporter that the goal of the Arab-China Friendship Association is to guarantee and safeguard the freedom of all countries oppressed by imperialism.

    He said that the Arab-China Friendship Association was prompted by his visit to China. In China, he was deeply moved by the Chinese people's deep friendship for the Arab people. He also praised China's support for Egypt during the tripartite aggression of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel. He added that China is now also taking the same sincere and noble attitude to condemn imperialist aggression against the Arab East, which threatens peace and security in the region.

    He emphasized that there is no closer friendship between countries than that which aims to respect human dignity and to realize lofty ideals through condemning aggression and safeguarding peace.

    The minister said that the friendship between Arab countries and China will last forever, because this friendship is based on the following three points: both sides have a long civilization; both sides have suffered from imperialism; and both sides are hardworking people who strive for freedom and oppose imperialism.

    The association's secretary-general, Mr. Murray, said that the association will widely introduce the lives of the Chinese people and their progress in economic, social and cultural aspects through films, speeches, mutual visits and exchange of books. He said that Arabic books on Chinese life, biographies of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, and China's Five-Year Plan are already in print. He said that the association will also publish books introducing Chinese agricultural cooperatives and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The Arab-China Friendship Association was originally established in January 1958 and was called the Egypt-China Friendship Association. It was reorganized in June this year to merge the Egypt-China Friendship Association and the Syria-China Friendship Association.

    阿拉伯—中国友协主席说
    阿中友谊将永远保持下去
    新华社开罗8日电　据中东通讯社8日报道，阿拉伯—中国友好协会主席、宗教基金部部长哈桑·巴库里向这家通讯社的记者说，阿拉伯—中国友好协会的目标是要保证和保障受帝国主义压迫的各国的自由。
    他说，阿拉伯—中国友好协会是他对中国的访问促成的。在中国，中国人民对于阿拉伯人民的深厚友谊使他深为感动。他还称赞了在英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及时中国给予埃及的支持。他又说，中国现在也采取了同样真诚和高尚的态度来谴责帝国主义对阿拉伯东方的侵略，这种侵略威胁着这个地区的和平和安全。
    他强调说，在国家之间再没有比目的在于尊重人类的尊严和通过谴责侵略及保障和平来实现崇高的理想的那种友谊更密切的了。
    这位部长说，阿拉伯同中国的友谊将永久保持下去，因为这种友谊是以下述三点为基础的：双方都有悠久的文明；双方都遭受过帝国主义之害；双方都是争取自由和反对帝国主义的勤劳的人民。
    这个协会的秘书长迈赖说，这个协会将通过电影、演说、互相访问和交换书籍来普遍介绍中国人民的生活以及他们在经济、社会和文化方面的进展。他说，关于中国的生活、毛主席和周恩来总理的传记以及关于中国的五年计划的阿拉伯文书籍已经在印刷中。他说，这个协会还将出版一些介绍中国农业合作社以及中国人民解放军的书籍。
    阿拉伯—中国友好协会最初是在1958年1月成立的，名为埃及—中国友好协会，在今年6月改组，把埃及—中国友好协会和叙利亚—中国友好协会合并在一起。
