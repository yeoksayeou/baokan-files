　　Hurrah! Hurrah!
　　Supporting the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué and Congratulating the Soviet Artificial Satellite for Orbiting the Earth Over a Thousand Times
　　(I) Almost a year now, artificial satellite arrives, the first one astonishing the world! Another one, and another, until today, more than a thousand orbits, circling the globe. "Dong Shi" sighs looking up at the sky, ultimately "imitating" in failure.
　　(II) In these past few months, warmongers, groundlessly sending troops here, increasing troops there, have you forgotten! The Suez Canal, the failed process of Syria, yet you call it limited war, local war. A great thief doesn't dare to act, so he becomes a petty thief. Bah! Utterly shameless. Exposing the charade, isn't it just that the big shots can't bear to part with oil profits!
　　(III) A thunderclap, thunder out of a clear sky, the talks between the top leaders of China and the Soviet Union, the people are cheering! Hurrah! It is an intercontinental missile, it is 900 million people, no, it is over 2 billion peace-loving people, their firm common will. The people's strength, combined with scientific authority, will terrify the warmongers.
　　(IV) Hurry up and get out, get out of Lebanon, get out of Jordan, get out of China's territory of Taiwan. Listen! The people of the imperialist countries themselves are also righteously shouting loudly, a summit conference should be convened quickly! Warmongers! Save some face! If you don't end this, by then, it will be too late to regret.

　　欢呼！欢呼！
　　拥护中苏会谈公报并祝苏联人造卫星环绕地球一千圈以上
    （一）快一年了，人造星来，第一颗天惊地讶！又一颗、又一颗，到今朝，不止一千圈，环绕全球大。“东施”长叹仰天空，到底“效颦”失败。
    （二）这几月来，好战狂人们，无端地这边进兵，那边增兵，忘掉了吗！苏伊士河、叙利亚失败的过程，倒说是有限战争、局部战争。大盗是不敢做的，做个小偷也行。咄！无耻透顶。拆穿西洋镜，还不是大王们舍不得石油利润！
    （三）霹雳一声，晴天的怒雷，中苏两大首脑的会谈，人民在欢呼！欢呼！是一颗洲际导弹，是九万万人，不，是爱好和平的二十几万万人，他们坚决的共同意愿。人民力量，结合了科学权威，好叫狂人们丧胆。
    （四）还不快快滚蛋，滚出黎巴嫩，滚出约旦，滚出中华领土台湾。听呀！帝国主义者的自己人民，也在正义地大声叫喊，首脑会议快快召开吧！狂人们！有面子！不收场，到那时，悔之已晚。
