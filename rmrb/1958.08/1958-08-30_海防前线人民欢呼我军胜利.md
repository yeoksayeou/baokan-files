Xinhua News Agency, Coastal Defense Front, August 27th: The people of the coastal defense front enthusiastically cheered the victories of our naval torpedo boat units, artillery units, and heroic air force in sinking and damaging two Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships and continuously shooting down and damaging American-made Chiang planes.

　　When the news of the victory reached merchant ships at sea early on the 26th, the crew members unanimously cheered "Well done!". Personnel on ships such as Hailu and Haixiang, who saw our powerful artillery units silencing the enemy's artillery on the 25th from the deck, cheered with joy. Coastal fishermen harassed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits said, "The People's Liberation Army has avenged us."

　　While cheering the victory, the people of the coastal defense front also wrote letters to the People's Liberation Army to express their condolences and congratulations. The letter from all the staff and workers of the Xiamen Iron Factory to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stated: We, all the staff and workers, must learn from your revolutionary heroism and win a great victory in production to guarantee the smelting of 5,000 tons of steel this year.

　　The broad masses of people on the coastal defense front are enthusiastically supporting the troops with practical actions. Women in the forward areas are boiling water and washing clothes for the soldiers, and many farmers are cooking buckets of sweet potato soup and sending them to the positions to quench the thirst of the soldiers who are fiercely annihilating the enemy.

　　海防前线人民欢呼我军胜利
    新华社海防前线27日电　海防前线各地人民热烈欢呼我海军鱼雷快艇部队、炮兵部队和神勇空军击沉击伤蒋贼军舰两艘和连续击落击伤美制蒋机的胜利。
    26日清早，胜利消息传到海上商船时，船员们一致欢呼“揍得好”。海鹭、海祥等轮船上的人员，25日在甲板上看到我强大炮兵部队打得敌人的大炮哑然无声，都高兴得欢呼起来。受到蒋贼军骚扰的沿海渔民说：“解放军替我们报仇了。”
    在欢呼胜利的同时，海防前线各地人民，还纷纷写信向解放军进行慰问和祝贺。厦门铁工厂全体职工给解放军某部的信中写道：我们全体职工要学习你们革命英雄主义精神，在生产上打个大胜仗，保证在今年内炼钢五千吨。
    海防前线广大人民正在热情地以实际行动支援部队。前沿地带的妇女为战士们烧开水、洗衣服，许多农民煮了一桶桶的红薯汤送到阵地给正在痛歼敌人的战士解渴。
