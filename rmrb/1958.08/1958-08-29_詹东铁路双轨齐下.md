　　ZhanDong Railway to Lay Double Tracks Simultaneously
　　The ZhanDong Railway, which runs for 385 kilometers across Henan and Shanxi provinces, from ZhanDian Station on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway to Dongguan Station on the Tongpu Railway, has been decided to be built into a double-track railway. This newly built railway was originally planned to be a single-track railway, but due to the development of Shanxi's coal industry, the recent transportation volume has surged, and a double-track is necessary to meet the needs. The construction plan has now been made, and the project has begun. (Yang Chuanqi)

　　詹东铁路双轨齐下
    从京广铁路的詹店车站起，至同蒲铁路的东观车站止，横穿河南山西两省，全省三百八十五公里的詹东铁路，已决定修成双轨铁路。这条新建铁路原计划修成单轨的，但由于山西煤炭工业的发展，近期运量激增，非双轨不能适应需要。现在施工方案已经做出，工程已经开始。　　（杨传启）
