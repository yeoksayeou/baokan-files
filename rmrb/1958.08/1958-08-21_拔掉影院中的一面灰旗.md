　　Pulling Down a Grey Flag in the Cinema
    During film screenings, whenever there are accidents like "film breaks," "loss of sound," or "image drifting," many audience members shout and applaud, and some even whistle like hooligans, causing chaos in the cinema.
    The story in the film is gradually leading the audience's emotions to a climax, and suddenly an accident occurs, which is certainly disappointing for the audience. But at this time, how do the projectionists feel? No! They feel just as uncomfortable as production workers when an accident occurs in production. Since this is the case, why can't we be considerate and instead create a disturbance? When the audience makes a commotion, they will become even more flustered and anxious, which is not conducive to them quickly finding the problem and eliminating the accident. The audience suffers the most. Moreover, during film screenings, especially when screening some old films, accidents are unavoidable no matter how careful the projectionists are. Since the accident has already happened, what's the point of making a fuss? Perhaps some people will say that this is criticism! Even if it's well-intentioned criticism, this kind of "criticism" is too uncivilized!
    The phenomenon of making a commotion in the cinema is not good. It's an unhealthy trend, a grey flag. We should all work together to pull it down and raise a red flag! Let the order of the cinema remain good from beginning to end.

　　拔掉影院中的一面灰旗
    放映电影的过程中，每当“断片”、“失声”、“走影”等事故时，不少观众总要呼喊、鼓掌，个别观众，竟像流氓似地打着“口哨”，轰得影场秩序大乱。
    影片里的故事，正节节把观众的情绪引向高潮，突然出了事故，观众败兴是会有的。但是，这时放映同志好受吗？不！他们就像生产工人在生产上发生事故一样难受。既是如此，我们为什么不会体谅人而哄闹起来呢？观众一哄场，他们的心会更慌更急，不利于他们尽快找出毛病消灭事故。吃亏的还是观众。况且，放映电影过程中，尤其是放映一些旧片子，放映同志再精心，事故还是难免的。事故既然发生了，哄闹有什么用呢？或许有人会说，这是一种批评啊！即使是好心的批评，这种“批评”也太不文明了！
    影场里哄闹的现象是不好的。是一股歪风，是一面灰旗。应该大伙齐心拔掉它，插上红旗！让影场秩序自始至终保持良好。
