　　Great Revolution in Government Work to Support the Great Leap Forward in Production
    Instrument Import Company Implements Rectification Spirit to Actively Complete Work Tasks

　　(Our Newspaper Correspondent Lin Hong reports) The Instrument Import Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade continues to implement the spirit of rectification, using the methods of full airing of views, big contending, and big-character posters, setting off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in government work.

　　After the conclusion of the government rectification movement in early July, the company leadership, in the spirit of continuous revolution, immediately issued a call to all staff, requesting the completion of 80% of the annual import task in the third quarter, using the Great Leap Forward in government work to support the Great Leap Forward in national economic and cultural construction. This call received an enthusiastic response from most people, but some people (including some leaders) believed that the order quantity was large and the time was short, and they lacked confidence in completing the task. The company leadership handed this issue over to the masses for discussion, calling on everyone to widely post big-character posters, actively put forward opinions on improving work, and publicize the situation of big-character posters posted everywhere every day. Those who actively responded to the Party's call, used their brains in many ways, thought of solutions, and posted the most big-character posters were promptly commended through broadcasting. Appropriate criticism was also given to those who were unwilling to use their brains, felt that there were not many opinions to offer, or were unwilling to offer more opinions. In the process of airing views, in response to the weariness that some people felt about posting big-character posters because they were worried that no one would read them, several big-character poster exhibitions were organized successively, and on-site observation meetings were held, using examples to illustrate the power and role of big-character posters, and further arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of all staff. By July 25, the company had successively launched two high tides of airing views, putting forward a total of 1,788 opinions. As a result, the situation of the Great Leap Forward appeared in the work, everyone used their brains and hands, and looked for sources of goods in many ways, understood the domestic demand for goods; and when handling each batch of orders, they completed the work that used to take several days or even ten days in just one day, in the spirit of racing against time. For example, the Optical Instrument Department once received a batch of orders from abroad for 4 million rubles, with a total of more than 200 contracts and more than 100 kinds of goods. In the past, it would have taken at least half a month to complete the signing of this batch of contracts. This time, thanks to the full effort of all the staff, working together day and night, the signing of the contract was completed in less than three days.

　　When this reporter went to interview, I felt that the scene in this agency was indeed unusual. Not only were red and green big-character posters posted everywhere, but everyone's work was very intense, and the loudspeaker constantly broadcasted new situations and new experiences of the Great Leap Forward in the business of this or that department. According to the relevant responsible comrades of the company, they felt that the method of full airing of views, big contending, and big-character posters was not only suitable for the rectification movement, but also for daily work, and it was indeed a good prescription for mobilizing the enthusiasm of staff and curing right-leaning conservative ideas. Those comrades who originally emphasized difficulties and believed that the task could not be completed have dispelled their right-leaning conservative ideas and are full of confidence in completing the task after everyone discussed their thoughts and presented the situation. For example, one comrade did not have a good understanding of foreign sources of goods and domestic demand for goods, so he believed that it would be difficult to complete the task. Coincidentally, another comrade discovered a new product in Czechoslovakia at the exhibition and put forward this situation. After contacting the department that needed the goods and inviting Czech experts to perform, it was quickly decided to order 700 units from abroad. In the face of the facts, this comrade had to admit that his thinking was conservative.

　　Now, after basically completing the task of placing orders, the company is strengthening the work of urging delivery so that the orders can arrive on time and ahead of schedule. Around this main problem, they have adopted a variety of methods. For example, changing single-line urging of delivery to double-line or triple-line urging of delivery, writing letters of thanks or sending pennants to companies in brotherly countries that deliver goods on time and ahead of schedule, simplifying forms and work procedures, ensuring that official documents and telegrams are sent out in a timely manner, and various accounts are settled in a timely manner. For example, the self-operated pricing of the Commercial Intelligence and Price Division has been simplified from 22 procedures to one, increasing work efficiency by five to six times. The administrative department also actively cooperated, implementing new work methods such as telephone file retrieval, door-to-door delivery of documents, and collecting documents and returning them home, so that daily tasks are completed on the same day, saving the time of business personnel and ensuring the smooth progress of business work.

### 机关工作大革命　支援生产大跃进  仪器进口公司贯彻整风精神积极完成工作任务

　　机关工作大革命　支援生产大跃进
    仪器进口公司贯彻整风精神积极完成工作任务
    本报讯　记者林洪报道：对外贸易部仪器进口公司继续贯彻整风精神，用大鸣大放大字报的方法，掀起了机关工作大跃进的高潮。
    7月初结束机关整风运动以后，这个公司的领导上就本着不断革命的精神，立即向全体工作人员发出号召，要求在第三季度内完成全年进口任务的80％，用机关工作大跃进支援全国经济和文化建设大跃进。这个号召得到大多数人的热烈响应，但是也有一部分人（包括一些领导人）认为订货数量大而时间又很短，对于完成任务缺乏信心。公司领导上就把这个问题交给群众讨论，号召大家广泛贴大字报，积极提出改进工作的意见，并且每天把各处贴大字报的情况加以公布。对于积极响应党的号召，多方面动脑筋、想办法，贴大字报最多的人，及时通过广播予以表扬。对于不肯多动脑筋，认为没有多少意见可提，也不愿意多提意见的人，也作了适当的批评。在鸣放过程中，还针对一些人耽心老贴大字报没有人看的厌倦情绪，先后组织了几次大字报展览，召开了现场观摩会，用实例说明了大字报的威力和作用，进一步鼓起了全体工作人员的革命干劲。到7月25日止，这个公司先后掀起了两次鸣放高潮，一共提出了一千七百八十八条意见。随着，工作也就出现了大跃进的局面，人人动脑动手，多方面地寻找货源，了解国内用货的情况；而在办理每一批订货时，又以和时间赛跑的精神，一天就做完了过去几天甚至十几天才能做完的工作。如光学仪器处有次接到国外报来的一批四百万卢布的订货单，一共有二百多份合同，一百多种商品。过去，办完这批合同的签订工作，最少也得半月时间。这次，由于全处工作人员鼓足了干劲，连夜突击一齐动手，不到三天就把签订合同的工作办妥了。
    当记者前往采访时，感到这个机关的景象确实是不同寻常，不但到处贴满了红红绿绿的大字报，而且每个人的工作都很紧张，扩音器不时播送出这个或那个部门业务跃进的新情况和新经验。据公司有关负责同志告诉我，他们感到大鸣大放大字报的方法不仅适用于整风运动，也适用于日常工作，而且确实是调动工作人员的积极性和医治右倾保守思想的良方。原来强调困难、认为完不成任务的同志，经过大家谈思想、摆情况，都已打消了右倾保守思想，对完成任务充满了信心。例如，有一位同志没有很好地了解国外的货源和国内用货的情况，就认为完成任务有困难。恰好另一位同志在展览会上发现捷克斯洛伐克出了一种新产品，就把这个情况提了出来。经过同用货部门联系，又请捷专家表演，很快就决定向国外订货七百台。在事实面前，这个同志不得不承认自己的思想保守。
    现在，这个公司在基本完成订货任务后，正在加强催交工作，使订货能够准时和提前到达。围绕着这个主要问题，他们采取了多种多样的办法。例如，改单线催交为双线或三线催交，给按时和提前交货的兄弟国家的公司写感谢信或送锦旗，简化表报和工作手续，作到公文函电及时发出，各种账目及时结算清楚。如商情物价处的自营作价，就由二十二道手续简化为一道，提高工作效率五、六倍。行政部门也积极配合，实行了电话调档、送卷上门、收文还家等新工作方法，作到当日事当日毕，节省了业务人员的时间，保证了业务工作的顺利进行。
