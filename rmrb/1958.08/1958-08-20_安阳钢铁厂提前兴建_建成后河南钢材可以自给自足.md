Anyang Iron and Steel Plant Built Ahead of Schedule
　　After Completion, Henan Province Can Be Self-Sufficient in Steel
    According to Henan Daily, the foundation project of the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces of Anyang Iron and Steel Plant in Henan Province officially started on August 10, six months ahead of schedule.

    After the completion of this iron and steel complex, it can produce 700,000 tons of iron, 600,000 tons of steel, and 500,000 tons of steel products annually. The plant has 22 main workshops, including mining, coking, sintering, ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, machinery repair, and power facilities. All workshop operations are mechanized. The steel produced by this plant can meet the needs of local industrial development in Henan.

    With the construction of the Anyang Iron and Steel Plant, a number of cooperative factories of great significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood will continue to be built. Such as a slag cement plant that uses the slag from the steel plant as the main raw material; a fertilizer plant that uses the coke oven gas from the steel plant's coking as the main raw material; a synthetic fiber plant that uses the refined benzene extracted from coal tar as the main raw material; and a coal washing plant that serves coking.

    The original plan of this plant was to produce 220,000 tons of pig iron and 80,000 tons of steel. It was determined that construction would officially begin in the first quarter of next year. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, the leadership of the plant overcame right-leaning conservative thinking, so that the design scale and construction speed have leapt forward again and again, and the iron production finally leapt to 700,000 tons, and the steel production leapt to 600,000 tons; the construction progress was advanced from the fourth quarter of next year to produce iron, and the first quarter of 1960 to produce steel, advanced to the first quarter of next year to produce iron, the second quarter to produce steel, and the whole project completed by the third quarter of 1960, advanced from 1961.

    In recent days, for the early start of the iron and steel plant, the entire Party and the entire people of Anyang City, especially the employees of the construction units, have demonstrated the heroic spirit of the working class, and have done everything possible to overcome numerous difficulties and made all preparations for the construction.

　　安阳钢铁厂提前兴建
　　建成后河南钢材可以自给自足
    据河南日报消息  河南省安阳钢铁厂的第一、二号高炉基础工程提前半年，于8月10日正式动工。
    这个钢铁联合企业全部建成后，可年产七十万吨铁，六十万吨钢，五十万吨钢材。厂内设有采矿部和焦化、烧结、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、机修、动力设施等二十二个主要车间。车间操作全是机械化。这个厂所出产的钢材可以满足河南地方工业发展的需要。
    随着安阳钢铁厂的兴建，还将继续兴建一些对国计民生有重大意义的协作工厂。如利用钢铁厂所炼过的矿渣为主要原料的矿渣水泥厂；利用钢铁厂炼焦的焦炉气为主要原料的化肥厂；利用煤焦油提炼出来的精苯为主要原料的合成纤维厂，还有为炼焦服务的洗煤厂等。
    这个厂原计划年产量为二十二万吨生铁、八万吨钢材，确定明年一季度正式动工兴建。在党的总路线的照耀下，这个厂的领导上克服了右倾保守思想，使设计规模和建设速度一再跃进，产铁量最后跃进为七十万吨，产钢量跃到六十万吨；建设进度由明年四季度出铁，1960年第一季度出钢，提前为明年一季度出铁，二季度出钢，由1961年提前为1960年三季度全部建成。
    在最近这些日子里，为钢铁厂的提前开工，安阳市全党全民，尤其是承建单位的职工们，表现了工人阶级的英雄气概，千方百计，克服重重困难，为施工作好了一切准备工作。
