    Imperialists Plot Conspiracy
    Baghdad Oil Depot Explodes
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 30th: An oil depot in the Bab al-Sharqi district, near the center of Baghdad, exploded and caught fire at noon on the 30th, destroying several oil tanks.
    Firefighters are trying to put out the fire. With the cooperation of the people, the army has set up guard posts around the scene. After the fire, the military announced a curfew starting at 8:00 PM.
    It is understood that the exploded oil depot is one of ten oil depots belonging to the British-owned Khanaqin Oil Company's storage facilities. The explosion occurred during lunchtime, when most of the workers were away. Only eight British people were inside.
    After the explosion, Iraqi army armored vehicles drove in and transported two of the British people out. The whereabouts of the other six are unknown.
    The public here believes that the fire is related to foreign conspiracies aimed at undermining the newly established Republic of Iraq. Crowds gathered around the fire scene, shouting slogans such as "Down with Imperialism!"

    帝国主义分子搞阴谋
    巴格达一储油库爆炸
    新华社巴格达30日电　位于巴格达市中心附近的巴卜沙尔基区的一个储油库在30日中午爆炸起火，烧毁了若干油池。
    消防队设法扑灭大火。军队在人民的合作下在现场周围设置了岗哨。在火灾发生后，军方宣布开始从晚上八时起实行宵禁。
    据了解，发生爆炸的油库是属于英商的汉纳金石油公司储油场的十个油库之一。发生爆炸时正是午饭休息时间，大部分工人都不在，只有八个英国人在里面。
    爆炸发生后，伊拉克军队的装甲车开进去把其中的两个英国人运出，另外六人下落不明。
    此间公众认为，这场大火同外国的阴谋有关，目的在破坏新成立的伊拉克共和国。聚在火场周围的群众高呼“打倒帝国主义”的口号。
