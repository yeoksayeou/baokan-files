    Salmonella Food Poisoning
  　Xie Yu
    In the bacterial world, there is a bacterial group with nearly two hundred kinds of bacteria, called the Salmonella genus, which specializes in showing its face in summer and autumn. If people are not careful and swallow them into their stomachs, and fail to deal with them in time, they will suffer a severe bout of vomiting and diarrhea!
    Under the microscope, you can see that Salmonella are short rod-like things with flagella on their bodies, scurrying back and forth in the water (a few have no flagella and do not move). They are not afraid of heat, and can resist for 20 minutes to 1 hour even when heated to 60 degrees Celsius. They love water and can live there for several months. Their breeding grounds are in livestock such as mice, cattle, sheep, chickens, geese, ducks, fish, and pigs.
    The intestines of mice often harbor a type of Salmonella　　Salmonella typhimurium. This bacterium can spread everywhere through mouse feces.
    The intestines of poultry and livestock such as cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks also contain various Salmonella on a daily basis. If the body resistance of these domestic animals is weakened, Salmonella will invade their blood vessels and roam everywhere, causing them to become sick and die. The internal organs, meat, especially the intestines, of these diseased and dead poultry and livestock are filled with a large number of Salmonella. However, the meat of poultry and livestock that did not die from disease sometimes also contains Salmonella, which is mostly contaminated from broken intestines, or from knives, sticks, cutting boards, or unclean water. There is also Salmonella inside eggs, and the shells are covered with a lot of them.
    The reproduction of Salmonella is closely related to the quality of food preservation. If raw and cooked food is placed in a hot and humid place with a lot of moisture, the bacteria will get the best conditions for growth.
    Salmonella causes upset stomachs because of its toxins. After this bacterium dies and the cells decompose, it turns into toxins. The human stomach and intestines are most afraid of this stuff. When it encounters it, it can cause congestion and edema in mild cases, and ulceration in severe cases. Generally, the onset is very rapid, suddenly causing nausea and vomiting, followed by waves of abdominal pain, waves of watery diarrhea, and some fever. After one or two days, or two or three days, the symptoms subside; some people get worse and worse, and finally succumb to the illness!
    Don't underestimate an upset stomach as a minor illness, medical experts dare not take it lightly. First, this disease can also kill people, with about one out of every hundred such patients dying. Second, this disease often occurs in the whole family or collectively, because as long as you eat the same spoiled food, it is difficult to escape. Third, according to the situation in the past few years, many people have suffered from this disease. In a certain province in the past year, more than 70,000 people contracted this disease in the summer and autumn seasons.
    This disease is entirely "disease enters through the mouth", so as long as you eat carefully, you can avoid it. The meat of diseased and dead poultry and livestock should be deeply buried in the soil. Daily meals should be stored in a cool place and thoroughly heated before eating. Raw meat pieces should be cut small and thin so that they can be thoroughly cooked (problematic meat should be boiled for at least two and a half hours). Do not eat raw eggs, do not eat spoiled food. Salmonella is afraid of salt pickling and vinegar soaking, we can eat more of these foods in hot weather. Salmonella grows particularly fast in milk, ice cream, and gelatinous foods, so be vigilant!

    沙门氏菌坏肚子
  　谢雨
    在细菌世界里，有一个拥有近二百种细菌的细菌集团，名叫沙门氏杆菌属，专在夏秋露脸。人要是不小心，把它们吞进了肚子，又没能及时对付住，就会大吐大泻地病上一场！
    在显微镜下，你能看到沙门氏菌是一根根短棍样的东西，身上长着鞭毛，匆匆忙忙的在水中颠来颠去（少数没有鞭毛，不会动）。它们不怕热，即使烫到摄氏六十度，还能顽抗二十分钟至一小时。它们喜爱水，能在那里活上好几个月。它们的繁殖基地，是在老鼠、牛、羊、鸡、鹅、鸭、鱼、猪等家畜身上。
    老鼠的肠子里，常常住着一种沙门氏菌　　鼠伤寒沙门氏菌。这细菌能顺着鼠粪四处播散。
    牛、羊、鸡、鸭等禽畜的肠道里，平日也有各种各样的沙门氏菌。如果这些家禽家畜的身体抵抗力减弱，沙门氏菌就会侵入它们的血管，到处流窜，使得它们害病死去。这些病死的禽畜的内脏、肉、特别是肠子，都布满了大量沙门氏菌。但在不是病死的禽畜的肉上，有时也有沙门氏菌，这多半是从破了的肠子里、或是从刀、杖、案板、或是从不干净的水里沾染来的。蛋中间也有沙门氏菌，蛋壳上更沾着不少。
    沙门氏菌的繁殖，和食物的保藏好坏大有关系。把生的、熟的食物，放在闷热的地方，食物里面水份又多，细菌就获得了发展的最好条件。
    沙门氏菌使人坏肚子，是它的毒素搞的鬼。这种细菌死灭之后，菌体分解，就变成毒素。人的胃肠最怕这东西，遇见了它，轻的充血水肿，重的会溃烂。一般起病很急，忽然一下，就恶心、呕吐起来，跟着肚子一阵阵的痛，一阵阵的水泻，还有些发烧。之后一、二天，或者二、三天，症状就消退了；也有少数人越犯越重，终于一病不起！
    别看吃坏肚子是小病，医学家对它却不敢大意。第一，这病也能死人，大概每一百个这样的病人之中，死的占一个。其次，这病常是全家或集体的发生，因为只要吃了同一种败坏的食物，就难幸免。第三，照过去几年的情形看，得这种病的人不少，前年某省在夏秋二季有七万多人得这病。
    这个病完全是“病从口入”，所以只要吃得当心，就能避免。病死的禽畜的肉应该深埋入土。平日的饭菜要贮放在凉处，食前彻底加热。生肉块要切得小，切得薄，以便煮烂炒透（有问题的肉品，至少煮二个半小时）。不要吃生蛋，不要吃馊食。沙门氏菌怕盐渍醋泡，热天我们可以多吃这方面的食品。奶、冰淇淋，以及有胶的食物，沙门氏菌在那里长得特别快，要警惕！
