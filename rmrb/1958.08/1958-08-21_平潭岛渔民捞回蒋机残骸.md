Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 18th: Fishermen on Pingtan Island, Fujian Province, salvaged the wreckage of a U.S.-made F86 Chiang Kai-shek plane that was shot down by our air force on the 14th of this month.

On the morning of the 14th of this month, fishermen from Pingtan Island and other small islands gathered in groups on the beaches, in fishing villages, and on fishing boats, and personally witnessed the People's Air Force aircraft formations shooting down two and damaging one U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes. When a Chiang Kai-shek plane nosedived into the sea east of Pingtan Island, sending up a towering column of water, more than 2,400 young and strong fishermen raced to pilot their fishing boats toward the sea east of Pingtan Island. The fishing boat piloted by Lin Shengxing and other fishermen from Baisha Village, Guocai Township, Pingtan Island, traveled particularly quickly. As they traveled, they concentrated on searching the surface of the sea. When they discovered a black object floating downstream not far ahead, they immediately chased after it and salvaged it. It turned out to be a tire from the U.S.-made F86 Chiang Kai-shek plane that had been shot down, with the clear English letters "U·S·A" on it. "The Chiang Kai-shek plane was smashed to pieces, and even the tires were shot off, and there are English letters on it!" Everyone immediately shouted with joy and immediately took it back and sent it to the relevant departments.

　　平潭岛渔民捞回蒋机残骸
    新华社福州18日电  福建省平潭岛渔民捞回本月14日被我空军击落的美制F86型蒋机残骸。
    本月14日上午，平潭岛和其他各小岛的渔民们，成群结队地聚集在海滩、渔村和渔船上，亲眼看到人民空军机群击落两架、击伤一架美制蒋机的情形。当一架蒋机一头栽入平潭岛东面的海里，击起冲天水柱时，二千四百多青壮年渔民，便争先驾起渔船向平潭岛东面海面急驰。平潭岛国采乡白沙村林生兴等渔民驾驶的渔船行驶得特别迅速，他们边行边聚精会神地向海面搜索，当他们发现前面不远的水面上一件黑色东西在顺流漂浮，大家马上直追上去，把它捞起。原来是被击落的美制F86型蒋机上一只轮胎，上面有清楚的U·S·A英文字。“蒋机被打得粉碎了，连轮胎也被打脱掉，上面还有英文呢！”大家顿时高兴得大叫起来，并立即把它带回送到有关部门。
