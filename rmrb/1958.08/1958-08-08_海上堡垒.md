Sea Fortress

On an island at the forefront of coastal defense, lives the First Platoon of the Third Company of a certain naval unit. For three years, this platoon has forged a flesh-and-blood relationship with the people on the island.

The soldiers have the closest relationship with the village militia. Initially, the militiamen were a bit lax upon seeing the Navy stationed in the village, leaving their guns in the agricultural cooperative's accounting office, where they rusted without anyone cleaning them. Platoon Leader Meng Qingquan then gathered the militiamen to explain the situation of the struggle against the enemy along the coast. After listening, the militiamen became more vigilant, always carrying grenades with them. Whenever the troops conducted exercises, the militia would automatically stand guard. In case of an emergency that required the troops to be on duty all night and needed extra manpower, the militia would automatically assist. During the day, when the militia were working in the fields, they often visited the troops during their breaks, and the soldiers would tell them about life in the military and teach them how to clean their guns. Every year, the platoon organizes personnel to the village to promote the Military Service Law. Militiaman Zhao Xiangui enlisted this year, and before leaving, he specially came to the platoon to say goodbye, promising the soldiers that after arriving at the troops, he would definitely write letters and send photos to report on his studies and work.

In addition to training and preparing for war, the platoon often sends people to help the villagers with production. Especially in May and June, when most of the men in the village were out fishing at sea and the farm work was also busy, the soldiers would help with watering, carrying sweet potatoes, and pushing carts, only doing the heavy work and becoming the backbone of the cooperative's production team. This year, during the wheat harvest, the government called for harvesting with sickles (so that the wheat roots could be left in the ground as fertilizer), but the islanders had always pulled the wheat by hand and didn't know how to use sickles. When the supply and marketing cooperative came to promote sickles, the cooperative didn't want to buy them. Platoon Leader Meng then said to Cooperative Director Xu Lunye: "Buy a dozen or so, and we will take the lead in using them!" Later, these dozen or so sickles proved invaluable, and more than twenty mu were harvested in two days. The cooperative members said: "The naval comrades are really capable; they are skilled in farming."

In daily life, the military and civilians are as close as family. The platoon's medic and hygiene soldiers often treat the villagers. Some comrades in the unit know how to give haircuts, and the young people on the island often come to him for a "trim." Grandpa Xu Qingye, before going out to sea, would say to the soldiers: "I entrust my home to you. With you here, I don't even need to lock the door at night."

This June, the platoon was going to build a watchtower. Platoon Leader Meng went to talk to the cooperative director about hiring workers. The cooperative director took one look at the site and realized that the materials were far from enough, so he went back and carried a spare mast. Then, he rode his bike around looking for stone. At that time, the cooperative was busy making nets, and manpower was very short, but they still spared five masons to help build the watchtower in a week. The station only spent a little more than sixty yuan.

The troops often go out to sea to perform tasks and need boats. Although the cooperative's production tasks are very tight, they always provide boats whenever needed. Once, Platoon Leader Meng had an urgent mission, and at the time, it was windy and rainy, and small boats couldn't go out, so the cooperative sent a motorized sailboat. Another day, in the middle of the night, they received a typhoon warning, and the cooperative director immediately led the cooperative members with anchors and ropes to help the troops secure their weapons and houses. Women's Director Zhao Shulan often leads the women to the station to wash quilts and mend socks.

Recently, with the American and British imperialists invading the Middle East, Platoon Leader Meng took advantage of the opportunity to show movies to explain the international situation to the villagers. The platoon also talked about current events to the fishermen on "August 1st" [Army Day], and organized a propaganda team to write slogans and perform shows. Currently, the military and civilians on the island are watching the current situation with hundredfold vigilance. They say: "We must not let the American devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits come to destroy our good life; we must be prepared at all times, and if the enemy dares to provoke a war, we will bury them in the sea!"

    海上堡垒
    郇琛
    在海防前线的一个岛屿上，住着海军某部队的三连一排。三年来，这个排和岛上的人民结成了血肉般的情谊。
    战士们和村里的民兵相处得最密切了。起初，民兵们见村里住了海军，就有点麻痹了，把枪放在农业社的会计室里，生了锈也没人擦。排长孟庆泉便召集民兵讲沿海对敌斗争的情况。民兵们听了以后，提高了警惕，手榴弹都经常带在身边。每逢部队进行演习时，民兵就自动地站岗放哨。遇有情况，部队要通宵值班，人员不够用，民兵就自动来协助。白天，民兵们在地里干活时，经常跑到部队休息，战士们就对他们讲部队生活情况，教他们擦枪。每年，排里都要组织人员到村里宣传兵役法。民兵赵贤贵今年入伍了，临走前特意到排里来告别，他向战士们保证：到部队后，一定写信、寄照片，报告学习、工作情况。
    排里除训练、备战外，经常抽人帮助老乡生产。特别是5、6月间，村里男人大部分出海捕鱼，农活也正忙，战士们便去帮助浇水、担地瓜、推车子，光拣重活干，成了社里生产队的骨干。今年收麦时，政府号召用镰刀割（麦根可以留在地里做肥料），可是，岛上历来都是用手拔的，不会用镰刀。供销社来推销镰刀，社里也不想买。孟排长就去对社长徐伦业说：“买下十几把吧，我们来领头干！”后来，这十几把镰刀顶了大事，两天就割了二十多亩。社员们说：“海军同志真能干，庄稼活是一把好手。”
    在日常生活中，军民之间也亲密得像一家人一样。排里的卫生员和卫生战士经常给老乡看病。部队有的同志会理发，岛上的青年人也常来“照顾”他。徐庆业老大爷要出海了，便对战士们说：“我这个家交给你们了。有你们在，晚上都用不着关门。”
    今年6月，排里要修一座了望岗楼。孟排长去找社长谈雇工人的事。社长到站上一看，认为材料还差得远，回去就把一根备用的桅杆扛来了。接着，他又骑着车子到处找石料。那时，社里正忙着结网，人力很缺，但还是抽出五名瓦匠来，一个星期就帮助把岗楼修好了。站上只花了六十多元。
    部队经常出海执行任务，要用船。社里生产任务虽然很紧，但总是随找随到。有一次，孟排长有紧急任务，当时刮风下雨，小船出不去，社里便派机帆船送。又有一天，半夜里接到台风警报，社长马上领着社员们带着铁锚和绳子跑来，帮助部队固定武器和房屋。妇女主任赵淑兰经常领着妇女们来站上洗被子、补袜子。
    最近，美英帝国主义侵略中东，孟排长就利用放电影的机会，向老乡们讲国际形势。排里在“八一”那天，还给渔民们讲时事，并组织宣传队去写标语、演节目。目前，岛上的军民都百倍警惕地注视着当前的局势。他们说：“决不能让美国鬼和蒋匪帮来破坏我们的好日子，要时刻准备好，敌人胆敢挑起战争，就把它埋葬在海底！”
