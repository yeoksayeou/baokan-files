　　Fantasy and Reality
　　Ye Mai
    In this era where "one day equals twenty years," many things that seemed like fantasies in the past have become reality, or are close to reality, and are in the process of becoming reality.
    Speaking of the word "fantasy," I have learned a lesson. I remember in March of this year, I saw a news report in the Hubei Daily about Zhou Tingying, a 19-year-old cotton girl from the Shouyi Cooperative in Sui County, who proposed a plan to produce 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Although last year she had already increased cotton production from a low yield of a dozen or several dozen jin to a high yield of more than 300 jin per mu, and although the news report described her measures in detail, including the number of cotton plants per mu and the number of bolls per plant, and although I am completely ignorant of agriculture, I should have believed the words of those who saw and heard it. But I couldn't help but be skeptical. Perhaps afraid of being accused of conservative thinking, I held back half of what I wanted to say, not daring to say the following: "Cotton can produce 1,000 jin per mu? Isn't that a rare wonder? It's like trying to make chicken feathers fly to the sky, daring to fantasize!"
    Not many days later, I saw Comrade Lin Shimeng, the Party Branch Secretary of the "May 1st" No. 2 Cooperative in Macheng, Hubei, say in the Liberation Daily that when they proposed a yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu last year, some people said they were "gods talking nonsense, dreaming while asleep"—which can be said to be roughly the same as my view; but they actually created a record of 1,200 jin of seed cotton per mu, and this year they are "dreaming of 2,000 jin!"—which gave my thinking a slight jolt, and I felt that my thinking was probably a bit conservative! So I began to doubt the word "fantasy."
    Recently, everyone knows the situation with wheat, from more than 3,000 jin per mu to more than 7,000 jin, one miracle after another. However, the People's Daily on July 13th told us that these production heroes are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They have proposed a large-scale wheat yield target of 10,000 to 12,000 jin per mu for next year, and the experimental field yield target is as high as tens of thousands of jin per mu. Early rice has also released a "satellite" of more than 36,000 jin per mu. As for cotton, an agricultural cooperative in Henan has proposed to produce 2,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. So, is it also conceivable that the yield will be several thousand jin or even tens of thousands of jin per mu in the future? The speed of development and change is truly beyond what ordinary people can predict. Therefore, I have to reconsider the word "fantasy."
    In the past, people often used the word "fantasy" to oppose unrealistic daydreams that lacked any basis. In fact, it should be said that there are two different types of fantasy. Unfounded daydreams can be said to be a distorted understanding of reality, a blindness that is divorced from life, random thoughts, and subjective assumptions. Even if there is a little objective basis, it is also a bounced check that can never be cashed. In the actual struggle of life, it is often the mother of opportunism and can demoralize people. This kind of empty fantasy is harmful, and we should indeed oppose it. But there is also another kind of fantasy. This fantasy is a kind of imagination rooted in the soil of life that conforms to the laws of development and has a realistic possibility. Because it uses imagination to reflect real life, expresses people's hopes for the future, and establishes goals for people to strive for, it can also encourage people to be "spirited and high-spirited," and fully exert their creativity and subjective initiative. It is often the pioneer of new things. Therefore, it can be said that it is a product of revolutionary romanticism, and it is of great benefit to the actual struggles that people are engaged in.
    Fantasy is a necessary condition for creation. Any invention or creation requires the help of rich imagination and is led by fantasy (the word used below refers to imagination that conforms to the laws of development). Daring to think is the starting point for daring to do and daring to act. Therefore, fantasy is necessary for human intellectual activities such as scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and technological reform. Lenin once said, "...it is absurd to deny that fantasy plays a role even in the most precise science..." (Philosophical Notebooks, p. 339) Even in social and political struggles, such as when Lenin was fighting against Martov and other Mensheviks, Lenin also taught revolutionaries to "fantasize"! He quoted the Russian writer Pisarev to explain why "to fantasize": "There are all sorts of disagreements—Pisarev wrote, discussing the question of the disagreement between fantasy and reality—my fantasy may outstrip the course of natural events, or it may run completely to a place that the course of any natural event will never reach. In the former case, fantasy is not harmful; it can even help and strengthen the worker's perseverance...In this fantasy, there is nothing that corrupts or paralyzes the ability to work. On the contrary. If a person has no ability to fantasize in this way at all, if he cannot occasionally run ahead, using his imagination to fully and thoughtfully imagine the work that has just begun to take shape under his hands—then I really cannot imagine what kind of stimulating force would drive people to carry out vast and arduous work in art, science, and practical life, and carry it through to the end..." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol. 1, pp. 335-336). The relationship between fantasy and real life is so clear.
    The role of fantasy is also verified by the countless miracles and various inventions and creations that have appeared recently. Comrades like Lin Shimeng can be said to be truly daring to fantasize. But if comrades like Lin Shimeng did not dare to dream unprecedented "dreams," then the achievement of 1,200 jin of seed cotton per mu that he created last year would not have been possible at all, and it would not be possible to create even greater miracles this year, and cotton would have to wear the hat of low yield forever. Therefore, fantasies like theirs (if their initial plan can be called fantasy) are precisely the kind of bold and creative fantasies that we need to accelerate socialist construction, and should be advocated rather than rashly opposed.
    The people have always been the most daring to give free rein to their imagination. Ancient Chinese myths, legends, and folk tales are full of colorful and bold imagination. Such as Chang'e flying to the moon, Hou Yi shooting down the sun, Nüwa refining stones to mend the sky, Sun Wukong riding the clouds and fog, etc., these illusions, wonderful associations and metaphors, are they not the pioneers of today's human transformation of nature and march into the universe? Speaking of this, I am reminded of a legend popular in my hometown. There are three isolated small mountains in the shape of a triangle south of my village. It is said that Yang Erlang (Jian) carried the mountains to chase the sun and walked to our place. The carrying pole broke, and he dropped two mountain frames. He kicked the mud on his feet vigorously and kicked out a small mountain that is still called "Tijiao Mountain." Yang Erlang was thirsty, and he inserted his finger into the ground and poked out a "Erlang Well," which has never stopped flowing all year round. In the past, our place was barren and poor, with poor mountains and bad waters. This story expresses people's desire to transform nature and strive for a better future. Yang Erlang is the embodiment of the people's will and strength, and people are realizing this wish just like Yang Erlang. Recently, I heard that a reservoir is under construction between these three mountains. So, mountains can be carried, the sun can be chased, and water can be freely driven. How bold would this have been in the past, but isn't this a vivid portrayal of today's people racing against time, forcing high mountains to bow their heads and rivers to give way?
    Marx once explained mythology in this way: "All mythology overcomes and dominates and shapes the forces of nature in the imagination and through the imagination; it disappears therefore when these forces are really dominated." The reason why the people dare to give free rein to their imagination is because they believe that they have the power and believe that nature can be transformed; and as their wisdom blossoms and bears fruit, fantasy becomes reality.
    In the current great leap forward in production, the working people of our country have carried forward the fine tradition of daring to think and daring to act. On the one hand, they are creating miracles, and on the other hand, they are creating thousands of baskets of folk songs to imagine and depict their glorious prospects. Pick a folk song at random, and you can see the people's bold imagination and heroic aspirations. For example, a new folk song in the Qinling Mountains:
    We will make rice flowers bloom on the beach,
    We will make pumpkins grow on trees;
    We will make wheat produce double ears,
    We will make corn three feet eight. . . .
    I heard that at the recent meeting of local and foreign experts to exchange experiences, one day a "local" expert was walking in the midday sun, covered in sweat. Someone asked him what he was doing. He said he was thinking about how to make an ear of wheat weigh more than one jin. It is really daring to imagine boldly! But this is not so much fantasy as it is a close or distant view of reality, a strange flower of abundant fruit. The people have set themselves a goal to strive for, predicting that their strength will surely overcome the sky and create a happy future.
    We are building an unprecedented new cause—building a socialist society and a communist society. If we want to strive for the upper reaches and continuously revolutionize in this cause, if we do not have such rich imagination as the masses and dare not fantasize, it will solidify and rigidify our thinking, and we will not be able to become a continuous revolutionary, but only a crawling empiricist. With rich imagination, we can go to a higher level, look far ahead, broaden our minds, and see the direction of our struggle clearly. Therefore, we propose to dare to fantasize. However, fantasy only suggests a possibility of reality, only reveals the scenery of the future; to turn the future into reality, the decisive condition is people's subjective efforts and practice. On the one hand, we must make our imagination conform to the laws of the development of things, and on the other hand, like production heroes, we must have the spirit of "stepping on the sky and breaking it, stomping on the ground and shaking it," muster our energy, strive for the upper reaches, and strive to realize our beautiful ideals. If we only dare to think but have no drive, fantasy can only be an empty fantasy and cannot be transformed into reality. As Pisarev said, "As long as the fantasist truly believes in his fantasy, carefully examines life, compares his experience with his castles in the air, and generally makes sincere efforts to realize his fantasy, then the disagreement between fantasy and reality will not be harmful. When fantasy has some contact with life, everything will go smoothly." We must dare to fantasize, and we must also open the door of our wisdom, develop creativity, and dare to do and dare to act. We must combine our fantasy with reality, combine the heroic courage of revolutionaries with the spirit of seeking truth; respect the practice of the people and believe in the wisdom and strength of the people. A beautiful future awaits us, and it depends on whether we dare to think and dare to do!

　　幻想与现实
　　叶迈
    在这“一天等于二十年”的时代，有许多在过去看来是幻想的事，已经变成现实，或离现实相近咫尺，正在变为现实。
    提到幻想这个字眼，在我是受过一点教训的。记得是在今年3月间，看到湖北日报上的一则通讯，说随县首义社一个十九岁的棉花姑娘周廷英，提出了亩产千斤皮棉的计划。虽然去年她已经使棉花由十几斤—几十斤的低产一跃而为亩产三百多斤的高产，虽然那篇通讯把她的措施说得很仔细，并且一亩长多少株棉花，一株结多少个花桃，一一作了计算，虽然我对于农业十足外行，按说应当听信目睹耳闻者的话，但我终不免将信将疑。也许是怕人说自己有保守思想吧，话到嘴边留半句，没敢说出下面的话来：“棉花能亩产千斤那不是天下的奇闻吗？真是想叫鸡毛上天，敢于幻想！”
    没有隔几天，看到湖北麻城“五一”二社党支部书记林世猛同志在解放日报上说，去年他们提出亩产千斤籽棉时，有人说他们是“神仙说天话，睡着了做梦”——这可说是与我的见识略同了；但他们竟然创造了亩产籽棉一千二百斤的高额纪录，今年“做梦也想两千斤！”——这却使我的思想微微一震，感到自己的思想大概是有些保守了！于是我开始怀疑起幻想这个词来。
    近来，小麦方面的情形是大家都知道的，由亩产三千多斤以至七千多斤，一个奇迹接着一个奇迹。可是，7月13日的人民日报又告诉我们，这些生产英雄并不满足既得的成绩，他们提出明年小麦大面积丰产指标为每亩一万至一万二千斤，试验田的亩产指标更高达几万斤。早稻也放出了亩产三万六千多斤的大“卫星”。至于棉花，河南的一个农业社已提出要在今年亩产皮棉二千斤。那么，是不是也可设想将来会亩产几千斤以至几万斤呢？事情的发展变化之快，真不是常人所可逆料的。于是，对于幻想这个字眼，我不得不重新做一番考虑。
    过去，人们往往把幻想这个词儿用来反对想入非非的、缺乏任何根据的空想。其实，应当说有两种不同的幻想。毫无根据的空想，可以说是对现实的一种歪曲的理解，是脱离生活的盲目性，是胡思乱想，主观臆想。即如多少有一点客观的根据，但也是一张永远不能兑现的空头支票。它在实际生活斗争中，常常是机会主义的母亲，能涣散人们的斗志。这种空洞的幻想是有害的，我们确乎应当反对。但也有另外一种幻想。这种幻想，是植根于生活土壤中的一种合乎发展规律的想像，具有现实的可能性。由于它用想像来反映现实生活，表现了人们对未来的希望，为人们树立了奋斗的目标，所以也就能鼓舞人们“斗志昂扬，意气风发”，充分发挥创造性和主观能动作用。它常常是新生事物的开路先锋。因而可以说它是一种革命浪漫主义的产物，它对于人们所从事的实际斗争是大有好处的。
    幻想是创造的必要条件。任何一种发明创造，都需要借助于丰富的想像，都是以幻想（下面所用的这个词都指合乎发展规律的想像）为先导的。敢想，是敢做敢干的起点。因此，幻想为人类的智力活动如科学研究、文艺创作、技术改革等等所必需。列宁曾经说过，……否认幻想也在最精确的科学中起作用，那是荒谬的……”（哲学笔记，三三九页）甚至在社会政治斗争中，如列宁在同马尔丁诺夫等孟什维克作斗争时，列宁也曾教导革命者“要幻想”！他并引用俄国作家皮萨列夫的话来解释为什么“要幻想”：“有各种各样的分歧，——皮萨列夫论到幻想与现实分歧问题时写道，——我的幻想可能追过自然事变进程，也可能完全跑到任何自然事变进程始终达不到的地方。在前一种情形下，幻想是没有什么害处的；它甚至能帮助和加强劳动者的毅力，……在这种幻想中，没有什么败坏或麻痹劳动能力的东西。甚至完全相反。如果一个人完全没有这样来幻想的本事，如果他不能间或跑到前面去，用自己的想像力来完满周到地推想刚才开始在他手下形成的作品，——那我就真是不能设想：究竟有何种刺激力量会驱使人们在艺术、科学和实际生活方面举行广大而劳苦的工作，并把它贯彻到底……”（“列宁文选”第一卷三三五—三三六页）幻想对于现实生活的关系，正是如此地显明。
    幻想的作用，同样为当前所出现的无数奇迹，为各种发明创造所验证。像林世猛等同志，可以说是真正敢于幻想的人物。但如果林世猛等同志不敢做前无古人的“梦”，那末他去年创造的亩产籽棉一千二百斤的成绩也就根本没有可能出现，今年也就不可能再创造更大的奇迹，棉花就只好永远戴上低产的帽子。因此，像他们这样的幻想（如果可以把他们最初提出的计划叫做幻想的话），正是我们为加速社会主义建设所需要的一种大胆的富于创造性的幻想，是应当提倡而不应该贸然加以反对的。
    人民群众历来都是最敢于驰骋自己的想像力的。我国古代的神话传说和民间故事中，就充满着五彩缤纷的大胆的想像。像嫦娥奔月，后羿射日，女娲氏炼石补天，孙悟空腾云驾雾等等，这种种幻景，奇妙的联想和比喻，岂不是开了今天人类改造大自然、向宇宙进军的先河么？说到这里，我想起了在我家乡流行的一个传说。我村南边有三座孤孤的成三角形的小山，传说是杨二郎（戬）担山赶太阳走到我们那里，扁担断了，把两架山座落下来，他把脚上沾的泥猛力一踢，又踢出了一个至今还叫“踢脚山”的小山。杨二郎渴了，用手指往地下一插，捣出了一个“二郎井”，至今终年泉水不竭。过去我们那里地瘠人贫，穷山恶水，这个故事就表达了人们改造自然，争取美好未来的愿望。杨二郎正是人民的意志和力量的化身，人们也正像杨二郎一样在实现着这种愿望。最近听说在这三座山之间正在动工修建一座水库。那么，山可担，太阳可赶，水可自由地驱使，这在过去该是多么大胆的夸张，但这不正是今天人们和时间赛跑，迫使高山低头、河水让路的生动写照么？
    马克思曾经这样来解释神话：“任何神话都是用想像和借助想像来征服自然力，支配自然力，把自然力加以形象化；因而随着这些自然力之实际上被支配，神话也就消失了。”人民群众之敢于驰骋自己的想像，是因为他们相信自己有力量，相信自然可以改造；而随着他们的智慧的开花结果，幻想也就变成了现实。
    我国劳动人民在目前的生产大跃进中，发扬了敢想敢干的优良传统，他们一方面创造着奇迹，一方面创作了千箩万担的民歌，来想像和描绘自己的光辉远景。随手拈来一首民歌，就可看出人民群众的大胆想像，壮志豪情。如秦岭新歌谣：
    要叫沙滩扬稻花，
    要叫树上结南瓜；
    要叫小麦出双穗，
    要叫玉米三尺八。……
    听说在最近的土洋专家交流经验的会上，一天有一位“土”专家在烈日当空的中午满头大汗的散步，有人问他在做什么，他说他在想怎样使一颗麦穗能长一斤多重。真是敢于大胆地想像！但这与其说是幻想，毋宁说是现实的近景或远景，是丰硕之果的奇花异朵。人民群众给自己树立了奋斗的目标，预言自己的力量定能胜天，定能创造幸福的未来。
    我们正在建树亘古未有的新奇事业——建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会。要想在这个事业中力争上游，不断革命，倘使没有群众这样丰富的想像力，不敢幻想，那就会使自己的思想凝固僵化起来，而不能成其为一个不断革命家，只能做一个爬行的经验主义者了。有了丰富的想像，才能更上一层楼，高瞻远瞩，心胸开阔，看清奋斗的方向。因此，我们提出要敢于幻想。但是，幻想只是提示了一种现实的可能性，只是启示了未来的光景；要把未来变为现实，决定性的条件是人们的主观努力和实践。一方面要使自己的想像合乎事物发展的规律，另一方面还要像生产英雄们那样，以“踏天天破，跺地地动”的气魄，鼓足干劲，力争上游，努力实现自己的美好理想。光是敢于想而没有干劲，幻想就只能是空洞的幻想，而不能转化为现实。还是皮萨列夫说得好：“只要幻想的人真正相信自己的幻想，仔细地考察生活，把自己的阅历与自己的空中楼阁相比较，且一般就诚恳努力实现自己的幻想，那末幻想与现实分歧就不会有什么害处。当幻想与生活多少接触时，就会一切都顺利了。”既要敢于幻想，又要启动自己的智慧之门，发扬创造性，敢做敢为。必须把自己的幻想与现实结合起来，把革命者的英雄胆略与求实精神结合起来；尊重人民群众的实践，相信人民群众的智慧和力量。美好的未来在等待着我们，就看我们是不是敢想，敢做！
