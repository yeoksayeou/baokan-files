Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 14th: Chongqing's streets and suburban rural areas have universally established collective welfare services, freeing over 69,000 housewives from the majority of their household chores, allowing them to participate in industrial and agricultural production.
　　The labor potential of Chongqing's street women is enormous. According to statistics from twenty-one residential sections of the Chongqing Qixinggang Street Office, among the more than 3,600 adults who do not participate in production and work, 90% are women. These women are eager to participate in production and social work, but the vast majority are married with children, struggling to escape the constraints of household chores. Housewives in suburban rural areas are also unable to work regularly due to household chores.
　　In order to completely change this situation, since July, the women have adopted simple and adaptable methods, without asking the government for a single penny, establishing 2,508 public canteens and 2,813 nurseries (stations), and forming over a thousand mutual aid organizations for sewing, washing, pig feeding, etc. In this way, the household chores that used to consume the most time and energy for women, such as cooking and taking care of children, are replaced by these collective welfare organizations. After being freed from most of their household chores, the women actively set up various small factories. At present, street residents in Chongqing have established 1,163 factories. Of the 41,868 employees, 31,037 are women, accounting for more than 76% of the total. Among them, 930 women have also taken on leadership roles in these factories. After being freed from most of their household chores, the attendance rate of women in suburban rural areas has also greatly improved. In Beibei District's Haoxing Township, where nearly 70% of women used to be unable to work regularly due to household chores, the attendance rate of women in the entire township has now reached over 99%.
　　At the same time, due to the large-scale establishment of collective welfare services, many family members of employees in various industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city have been freed up to participate in production. According to statistics from seventy-three units, employee family members have established 661 satellite factories. These satellite factories undertake processing, assembly, and various auxiliary tasks for the main factories, saving a large number of auxiliary workers and supporting the production of the main factories.

　　重庆妇女发挥劳动潜力
　　街道居民办起千所工厂，三万多妇女当了工人
    新华社重庆14日电　重庆市街道和郊区农村普遍举办集体福利事业，已使六万九千多家庭妇女摆脱了大部分家务的牵累，参加工农业生产。
    重庆市街道妇女的劳动潜力很大。据重庆七星岗街道办事处二十一个居民段的统计，在三千六百多名没有参加生产和工作的成人中，90％是妇女。这些妇女都渴望参加生产和社会工作，但她们绝大多数都结了婚，有孩子，苦于无法摆脱家务的牵累。郊区农村妇女也因为家务牵累而不能经常出工。
    为了彻底改变这种状况，妇女们从7月份以来采取因陋就简、因地制宜的办法，没有要政府出一分钱，办起了二千五百零八个公共食堂和二千八百一十三个托儿所（站）、成立了上千个缝纫、洗衣、喂猪等互助组织。这样，原来耗费妇女时间和精力最多的煮饭、带孩子等家务劳动就由这些集体福利组织代替了。妇女们摆脱了大部分家务以后，积极兴办各种小型工厂。目前重庆街道居民已办起一千一百六十三个工厂，在四万一千八百六十八名职工中，有妇女三万一千零三十七人，占总人数的76％以上。其中九百三十名妇女还担任了这些工厂的领导工作。郊区农村妇女在摆脱大部分家务以后出勤率也大大提高。北碚区嗥兴乡原来有将近70％的妇女因家务拖累出工不经常，目前全乡妇女出勤率已达99％以上。
    同时，全市各工矿企业的职工家属也由于大办集体福利事业，腾出许多人参加了生产。据七十三个单位的统计，职工家属们已办起六百六十一个卫星工厂，这些卫星厂为主厂担任加工、装配和各种辅助工作，节省了大量辅助工人，支援了主厂的生产。
