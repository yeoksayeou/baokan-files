　　Deathbed Struggle
　　By People’s Daily Commentator
    The Hussein petty court of Jordan, teetering in the wind and rain, is undergoing a deathbed struggle. The prisons are packed with "political prisoners." Many have already been secretly murdered, and many more are being subjected to cruel torture. And their only crime is opposing the British army's occupation of Jordan and demanding that the British army withdraw from their homeland. Recently, even the leaders of the "Muslim Brotherhood," who previously supported the Hussein dynasty, have been arrested. The glint of knives and murderous intent cast a sinister shadow over both banks of the Jordan River. However, the flames of resistance buried in the hearts of the Jordanian people are burning ever brighter.
    Hussein's traitorous rule has aroused the people's dissatisfaction. The people's discontent is impacting his throne. In order to maintain his throne, he and Macmillan staged a farce of "inviting troops to protect him," bringing in the British army. But the British army's occupation has aroused even greater hatred and resistance from the people. Now, under the protection of the British army's bayonets, Hussein is seeking salvation from prisons and gallows, attempting to intimidate the people with bloody suppression. But this can only lead him deeper and deeper, and will only further arouse the people's anger and resistance, with no other result. The recent death sentences imposed by the Jordanian authorities on thirteen patriots, including the young woman Nadia Salty, have already caused "the whole of Jordan to boil," with a rising tide of protests, which is proof of this. It is very clear: the Jordanian people have not been intimidated, but it is the traitorous and isolated dictator Hussein himself who is constantly worried and uneasy. He said that he is in "constant danger, even in my castle."
    Hussein has already used his private plane, piloted by British pilots, to transport the royal family's valuables and the country's precious property to Cyprus. Most of the royal family, along with the Queen Mother Zein, have fled Jordan. Hussein, who is still stubbornly sitting on the tottering throne, has also placed a helicopter on the roof of the palace, ready to flee at any time. Jordanian officials who are aiding and abetting the tyrant and cruelly oppressing the people are also selling their houses and land one after another, each making their own plans. This is exactly a scene of a collapsing house and fleeing rats. And Hussein, in his struggle to maintain his few remaining days on the throne, is desperately brandishing his butcher knife, letting it be stained with the blood of Jordanian patriots. Hussein's inhuman and barbaric crimes have also aroused the boundless anger of all righteous people in the world, who have sent letters and telegrams demanding that Hussein immediately stop harming Jordanian patriots.
    Hussein was in the past, and still is, nothing more than a puppet. The committee now responsible for maintaining Hussein's throne and the security of the Jordanian government is led by the British and American military attachés stationed in Amman. This committee compiles lists of Jordanian patriots to be arrested and issues orders directly to the security officers. This situation makes it even clearer that Britain's dispatch of troops to invade and occupy Jordan is not to "maintain" the "independence" of this small country, but to suppress the resistance of the patriotic people of Jordan and to firmly control Jordan under their colonial rule.
    Neither the British army nor American money can save the fate of Hussein's traitorous dynasty, which has been spurned by the people. Western journalists who are relatively clear-headed also see that "it is impossible to turn back the clock or make it stop." One day, Hussein and his masters will stand in the dock and await the judgment of the people.

　　末日的挣扎
　　本报评论员
    风雨飘摇的约旦侯赛因小朝廷，正在进行末日的挣扎。监狱里关满了“政治犯”。很多人已经暗遭杀害，还有很多人正在遭受酷刑的折磨。而他们的唯一罪名就是反对英国军队占领约旦，要求英国军队从自己的国土上撤出去。最近连以前支持侯赛因王朝的“穆斯林兄弟会”的领袖也被捕了。刀光杀气，阴森森地笼罩着约旦河两岸。然而，埋在约旦人民心头的反抗的怒火也在越烧越旺。
    侯赛因的卖国统治激起了人民的不满。人民的不满冲击着他的王位。为了保持王位，他和麦克米伦串演了一场“请兵保驾”的双簧，搬来了英国军队。而英国军队的占领却激起了人民更大的仇恨和反抗。现在，侯赛因在英国军队的刺刀保护下，又求救于监狱和绞架，想用血腥的镇压来吓倒人民。但这只能愈陷愈深，除了更加激起人民的愤怒和反抗而外，不会有别的结果。最近约旦当局判处女青年纳迪亚·萨勒提等十三名爱国者死刑，已经使“整个约旦沸腾”，抗议的怒潮风起云涌，就是一个证明。事情很明显：约旦人民没有被吓倒，而整天提心吊胆、神魂不安的却是众叛亲离的卖国独夫侯赛因自己。他说，他处于“不断的危险中，甚至在我的城堡中也是这样”。
    侯赛因已经把王室的贵重物品和国家的珍贵财产，用英国飞行员驾驶的他的私人飞机运到塞浦路斯。王室的大部分人员，连同王太后泽恩都已逃离约旦。现在还硬着头皮坐在摇摇欲倒的宝座上的侯赛因，也把一架直升飞机放在王宫屋顶，准备随时逃之夭夭。为虎作伥、残民以逞的约旦官员，也在纷纷出卖住宅、土地，各作各的打算。这正是破屋将坍，狐鼠搬家的一幅景象。而侯赛因在维持他末日无多的王位的挣扎中，却拚命挥舞屠刀，让它沾满约旦爱国者的鲜血。侯赛因这种丧失人性的野蛮罪行，也激起全世界一切正义人士的无比愤怒，纷纷发出函电要求侯赛因立即停止残害约旦爱国者。
    侯赛因过去是，现在依然不过是一个傀儡。现在负责维持侯赛因王位和约旦政府安全的一个委员会，就是由驻安曼的英国和美国的武官领导的。这个委员会编制逮捕约旦爱国者的名单，直接向保安军官们发布命令。这种情形使人们更清楚地看出：英国派遣军队侵占约旦，并不是为了什么“维护”这个小国的“独立”，而是为了镇压约旦爱国人民的反抗，把约旦牢牢地控制在它们的殖民统治之下。
    英国的军队也好，美国的金元也好，都挽救不了受到人民唾弃的侯赛因卖国王朝的命运。西方较为清醒的记者也看到“既不能使时钟倒转，也不能让它停下”。总有一天，侯赛因和他的主子们会站到被告席上，听候人民的审判。
