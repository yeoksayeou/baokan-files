Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 5th: Ye Jinghao, head of the Chinese economic delegation, held a cocktail party on the evening of the 4th to celebrate the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia and to welcome Prince Sihanouk's upcoming visit to China. Princess Yukanthor, members of the Royal High Council Lan Ngeth, Sang Yun, U Chun, Zhang Qiang, and Speaker of the National Assembly Chau Saukosal, as well as other senior Cambodian figures, attended the reception.

At the reception, Sihanouk told the more than 300 guests that "You all know that Cambodia and China established relations long ago. We are very pleased to point out that this relationship has always been based on the principles of equality and respect for national sovereignty. In the glorious Angkor era, there was indeed a precursor to the Pancha Shila, the five principles that guide the relations between our two countries today.”

Sihanouk said, "In a few days, I will lead a national delegation to Beijing at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. I firmly believe, as I have often said before, that a visit to this friendly great power, this high-level contact, is essential for developing friendship between the peoples and the two countries."

Sihanouk said: "I would also like to thank the powerful New China for the unconditional economic assistance it has given us, which is very suitable for our needs. I would especially like to express my gratitude to the Chinese Economic Delegation for their efforts over the past two years to ensure that this assistance is implemented in Cambodia according to plan."

At the beginning of the cocktail party, Ye Jinghao first warmly congratulated Prince Sihanouk on his second visit to China and on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. He said that this marks a new stage in the traditional friendly relations between China and Cambodia and fully conforms to the common aspirations of the two peoples. Ye Jinghao said that the Chinese government and people deeply sympathize with and support the just and firm stand taken by the Cambodian government and people in defending national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

    我驻金边经济代表团团长举行酒会
    贺中柬建交并为西哈努克饯行
    新华社金边5日电　中国经济代表团团长叶景灏4日晚上为中柬建交和欢迎西哈努克亲王将去中国访问举行鸡尾酒会。尤卡瑟王姑，皇廷最高会议委员兰·涅特、桑云、乌春、张强和国民议会议长萧桑科萨以及其他柬埔寨高级人士都出席了酒会。
    西哈努克在酒会上向三百多名宾主讲话说：“你们都知道，柬埔寨和中国很久以前就建立了关系。我们很高兴地指出，这种关系是始终依据平等和尊重国家主权的准则的。在光辉的吴哥时代，确实已经有了今天指导我们两国之间关系的潘查希拉五项原则的前身。”
    西哈努克说，“过几天，我将应周恩来总理的邀请，率领一个国家代表团前往北京。我坚信，像我以前经常说的那样，对于这个友好的大国的访问、这种最高级的接触，是发展两国人民和两个国家之间的友谊所必不可少的。”
    西哈努克说：“我还愿意感谢强大的新中国给予我们的、非常适合我们需要的无条件的经济援助，我特别愿意对中国经济代表团两年多以来为了使得这种援助得以按照预定计划在柬埔寨实施而尽的努力表示感谢。”
    叶景灏在鸡尾酒会开始的时候，首先热烈祝贺西哈努克亲王将第二次去中国访问和中柬建交。他说，这标志着中柬两国之间传统的友好关系的新阶段，并且完全符合两国人民的共同愿望的。叶景灏说，中国政府和人民极为同情和支持柬埔寨政府和人民在捍卫民族独立、主权和领土完整方面所采取的正义的和坚定的立场。
