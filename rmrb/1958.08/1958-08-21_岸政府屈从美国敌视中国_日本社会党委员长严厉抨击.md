Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki, speaking to the press in Tagawa City, Fukuoka Prefecture on the 19th, vehemently condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government's subservience to American foreign policy. He emphasized that there was no way to improve Japan-China relations unless the Kishi government changed its diplomatic course. After denouncing the Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China, Suzuki said that even some members of the Kishi cabinet and the Japanese financial and business world had voiced calls for a change in the policy of hostility towards China.

Suzuki pointed out that this autumn, international circumstances, particularly changes in the American economic situation, the deepening of the Japanese economic crisis, and the compilation of the 1959 budget would become major issues for Japan. He said that the Socialist Party, while demanding the implementation of a friendly policy towards China, also wanted to eliminate American interference in Japan and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, which was leaning towards the United States.

Mosaburo Suzuki stated that the Socialist Party would, during the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, force the Kishi Nobusuke government to change its foreign policy and develop these activities into a movement to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Kyodo News said that Suzuki's remarks showed that "the Socialist Party, in response to the recent blatant reactionary nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government's domestic and foreign policies, has taken a step forward in its serious confrontation with the Kishi Nobusuke government."

Suzuki arrived in Fukuoka on the 17th to assist Socialist Party candidates in the by-election for a member of the House of Councillors in Fukuoka Prefecture.

　　岸政府屈从美国敌视中国
    日本社会党委员长严厉抨击
    新华社20日讯  东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎19日在福冈县田川市向报界发表谈话，激烈谴责岸信介政府屈从美国的外交政策，并且强调指出，除非岸信介政府改变外交方针，没有别的办法可以改善日中关系。铃木在指责了岸信介政府的敌视中国的政策后说，甚至岸信介内阁里的一部分阁员和日本金融实业界也发出了要求改变敌视中国的政策的呼声。
    铃木指出，今年秋季，国际形势特别是美国经济情况的变化、日本经济危机的加深和编制1959年度预算等问题将要成为日本的主要问题。他说，社会党一方面要求执行对中国的友好政策，同时要排除美国对日本的干涉，打倒向美国一边倒的岸信介政府。
    铃木茂三郎表示社会党要在日本国会举行临时会议的时候，迫使岸信介政府改变它的外交政策，并且要使这些活动发展成为打倒岸信介政府的运动。
    共同社说，铃木的谈话显示出，“社会党针对最近岸信介政府的对内和对外政策变得露骨反动的情况，把认真同岸信介政府对抗的态度向前推进了一步”。
    铃木是为了帮助社会党人在福冈县的参议院议员补缺选举中进行竞选在17日到达福冈的。
