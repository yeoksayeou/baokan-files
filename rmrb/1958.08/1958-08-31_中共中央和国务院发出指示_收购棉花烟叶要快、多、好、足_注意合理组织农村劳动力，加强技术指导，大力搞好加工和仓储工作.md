Xinhua News Agency, August 30th – The CCP Central Committee and the State Council's Instructions on Strengthening the Procurement of Cotton and Tobacco Leaf, August 30, 1958

　　This year's cotton and tobacco leaf, like grain, are growing very well; at present, farmers everywhere are going all out to continue strengthening late-stage field management, and barring major natural disasters, these crops will achieve unprecedented harvests. It is estimated that the national cotton output will increase by about 100% compared to last year, and the tobacco leaf output will increase by about 200% compared to last year. All localities must earnestly do a good job in the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaf in order to promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production to a greater extent. At present, some places have already started listing cotton and tobacco leaf on the market, and the season for large-scale listing is approaching. In order to do a good job in the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaf, the following instructions are now given:

　　(1) The procurement of cotton and tobacco leaf must adopt the principle of fast procurement, plentiful procurement, good procurement, and sufficient procurement. Doing a good job in the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaf at the fastest speed can enable agricultural cooperatives to promptly exchange them for means of production and means of livelihood, thereby preparing conditions for expanding agricultural reproduction; at the same time, it can also supply a large amount of raw materials for industry, expand the market, and thereby promote the development of industrial production.

　　(2) Great attention must be paid to the methods of procurement and to the rational organization and arrangement of rural labor. This year's doubling of cotton and tobacco leaf commodity volumes is an unprecedentedly good situation, but it has also created many problems as a result. The main ones are: agricultural cooperatives selling cotton and tobacco leaf, not only in large quantities and volumes but also in a very concentrated timeframe, while the peak season for cotton and tobacco leaf procurement is also the busy autumn farming season. In this way, incoordination may occur between the various procurement links and between the procurement work and other tasks. If the arrangements are not good, it may affect the smooth progress of cotton and tobacco leaf procurement or affect other work in rural areas. Therefore, on the one hand, great attention must be paid to the methods of procurement, such as going deep into agricultural cooperatives to inspect and grade at the cooperative, procure at the cooperative, process at the cooperative, and store at the cooperative, or allowing agricultural cooperatives to grade, bundle, and weigh themselves according to national regulations and requirements, and directly send them to the procurement units. On the other hand, we should pay attention to the rational allocation and organization of rural labor to ensure that cotton and tobacco leaf picking, grading, processing, selling, storage, and transportation are done in a timely manner. That is to say, we must not only appropriately meet the needs of procurement work, but also do everything possible to save rural labor and not hinder the progress of other rural work.

　　(3) Strengthen technical guidance to agricultural cooperatives, rely on the masses to do a good job in the grading and inspection of cotton and tobacco leaf, implement democratic grading, and launch a movement of fine picking and detailed harvesting to improve the quality of cotton and tobacco leaf and increase the actual harvest of cotton and tobacco leaf. Purchasing departments and agricultural departments should pay attention to helping agricultural cooperatives train technical personnel, implement the "four separations" method for cotton: separate picking, separate drying, separate storing, and separate selling, or add separate ginning for the "five separations" method. On this basis, the "five appraisals" method should also be implemented, whereby agricultural cooperative representatives and purchasing station personnel jointly appraise the grade, length, moisture, impurities, and lint percentage of cotton. In the cotton picking process, the "three searches" method of searching for "eyelashes," searching for boll cotton, and searching for fallen cotton should also be implemented to ensure that all cotton in the fields is picked clean, with "every fluff returning home." For tobacco leaf, we should also refer to the methods used to process cotton to improve the picking, delivery, and other tasks, and pay attention to relying on the masses and improving the curing of tobacco leaf.

　　(4) Vigorously improve processing and warehousing and implement technological innovation. After a large amount of cotton and tobacco leaf is procured, processing and warehousing capacity will be severely inadequate, which is a problem that party and government organs at all levels urgently need to solve. At present, the solution is: on the one hand, rely on the strength of the masses, adopt both indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main approach, to increase processing and warehousing equipment; on the other hand, launch a technological innovation movement to improve the utilization efficiency of processing and warehousing equipment.

　　(5) In order to do a good job in the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaf, party and government organs at all levels must strengthen leadership, be diligent in inspection, educate cadres and the masses of farmers in the spirit of the Party's General Line, and resolutely complete the state's cotton unified purchase task and tobacco leaf procurement task. At the same time, commercial departments must, in expanding and accelerating commodity circulation, implement the viewpoint of putting politics in command and serving production and serving the masses, overcome the purely commercial viewpoints and right-leaning conservative thinking of being afraid of stockpiling, afraid of difficulties, and not actively doing a good job in procurement.

　　In addition, while arranging and doing a good job in the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaf, all localities must also earnestly arrange and do a good job in the procurement of hemp and the stripping of cotton seed linters.

　　It is hoped that the Party committees and People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government will, in accordance with the above instructions, carefully prepare for this year's cotton and tobacco leaf procurement work and make a special systematic deployment.

### 中共中央和国务院发出指示  收购棉花烟叶要快、多、好、足  注意合理组织农村劳动力，加强技术指导，大力搞好加工和仓储工作

　　中共中央和国务院发出指示
    收购棉花烟叶要快、多、好、足
    注意合理组织农村劳动力，加强技术指导，大力搞好加工和仓储工作
    新华社30日讯　中共中央、国务院关于加强棉花、烟叶收购工作的指示　一九五八年八月三十日
    今年的棉花、烟叶也和粮食一样，生长情况很好；目前各地农民正在鼓足干劲，继续加强后期的田间管理，只要不发生特大的自然灾害，这些作物将会获得空前的丰收。预计全国棉花产量将比去年增加一倍左右，烟叶产量将比去年增加两倍左右。各地必须切实做好棉花、烟叶的收购工作，以便在更大程度上促进工农业生产的大跃进。目前有的地方棉花、烟叶已经开始上市，大量上市的季节即将到来，为了做好棉花、烟叶的收购工作，现在作如下指示：
    （一）棉花、烟叶的收购工作，必须采取快收、多收、收好、收足的方针。用最快的速度做好棉花、烟叶的收购工作，可以使农业社及时换回生产资料和生活资料，从而为扩大农业再生产准备条件；同时也可以为工业供应大量的原料，扩大市场，从而促进工业生产的发展。
    （二）必须十分注意收购工作的方法，并且合理地组织和安排农村的劳动力。今年棉花、烟叶商品量成倍地增长，是空前未有的好情况，但是因此也产生了许多问题。主要是：农业社出售棉花、烟叶，不但数量多，容积大，而且时间非常集中，同时棉花、烟叶收购的旺季，又是大秋农忙季节，这样，在各个收购环节之间，在收购工作同其他工作之间，就可能发生互不协调的现象。如果安排不好，就可能影响棉花、烟叶收购工作的顺利进行，或者影响农村的其他工作。因此，一方面必须十分注意收购工作的方法，比如，深入农业社就社验级、就社收购、就社加工和就社保管，或者由农业社根据国家的规定和要求，自行分级、打包、过秤，并且直接送到收购的单位。另一方面，应该注意合理调配和组织农村的劳动力，保证及时作好棉花、烟叶的采摘、分级、加工、出售和保管、调运等工作。这就是说，既要适当满足收购工作的需要，又要尽一切可能节省农村的劳动力，不妨碍农村其他工作的进行。
    （三）加强对农业社的技术指导，依靠群众作好棉花、烟叶的分级、检验工作，实行民主评级，开展精收细摘的运动，以提高棉花、烟叶的质量，增加棉花、烟叶的实际收获量。采购部门和农业部门，应当注意帮助农业社训练技术人员，对于棉花实行分摘、分晒、分存、分售的“四分”方法，或者加上分轧的“五分”方法。在这个基础上，还应该实行由农业社代表和采购站人员共同评定棉花的品级、长度、水分、杂质、衣分的“五评”方法。在棉花采摘过程中，还要实行找“眼睫毛”、找瓣棉、找落地棉的“三找”方法，做到把田间棉花全部拾干拣净，“朵絮还家”。对于烟叶，也应当参照处理棉花的方法，改进采摘、交售等工作，并且注意依靠群众、改进烟叶的烤制工作。
    （四）大力搞好加工和仓储工作，实行技术革新。在棉花、烟叶大量收购以后，加工和仓储能力将会感到严重不足，这是各地党政机关急需解决的一个问题。目前解决的办法是：一方面依靠群众的力量，采取土洋并举、以土法为主，来增加加工、仓储的设备；另一方面要开展技术革新运动，提高加工、仓储设备的利用效率。
    （五）为了做好棉花、烟叶的收购工作，各级党政机关必须加强领导，勤于检查，以党的总路线的精神教育干部和农民群众，坚决完成国家的棉花统购任务和烟叶收购任务。同时，商业部门必须在扩大和加速商品流通工作中，贯彻执行政治挂帅和为生产服务、为群众服务的观点，克服怕积压、怕困难、不去积极作好收购工作的单纯商业观点和右倾保守思想。
    此外，各地在安排和做好棉花、烟叶收购工作的同时，还必须切实安排和做好麻类的收购工作和剥取棉籽短绒的工作。
    希望各省、自治区、直辖市党委和人民委员会，根据上述指示，对于今年的棉花、烟叶收购工作认真进行准备，并且专门作一次统系的布置。
