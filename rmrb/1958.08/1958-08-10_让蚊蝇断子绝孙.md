Let Mosquitoes and Flies Die Without Descendants
Gu De, Deputy Director of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee

Recently, the people of the capital, in the sanitation blitz, used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods such as fumigation, brushing, spraying, and swatting, to eliminate a large number of mosquitoes and flies.

In the past, people were accustomed to using mosquito coils, fire ropes, and mugwort to fumigate mosquitoes. Although mosquitoes and flies were driven away at the time, they were not eliminated. Now, everyone has switched to using medicines for fumigation. This method is not just about driving away mosquitoes and flies so they don't bite, but about annihilating them.

During the day, mosquitoes like to hide in dark, damp places to rest, and they come out in droves at dusk. After they gather together to mate, the female mosquitoes will try to bite people and suck blood to supply the development of their ovaries for laying eggs. According to this habit of mosquitoes, the doors, windows, and lights of the dwelling should be opened at dusk to lure the mosquitoes into the room so as to gather and annihilate them. The method of annihilation is: in an ordinary room, use thirty grams of 6% wettable 666 powder or 666 smoke agent, ignite the medicine, so that the dense smoke emitted by the medicine fills every corner of the room, and then close the doors and windows tightly. When mosquitoes come into contact with the thick smoke, their central nervous systems will be poisoned and paralyzed to death. After being sealed for half an hour to an hour, open the doors and windows to ventilate before people can enter the room again, otherwise people will also be poisoned.

Contrary to the activity pattern of mosquitoes, flies are most active during the day. When flies fly into the room after contacting feces and other dirty things, they always like to land on walls, ceilings, and other places. In the past, people often sprayed insecticides such as DDT on the walls. Although this method was effective, it used a lot of medicine and cost a lot of money. Now, people use 6% wettable 666 powder mixed with whitewash to brush the walls, and the effect of killing flies is very good. In ordinary families, a general room uses four ounces of medicine, four catties of whitewash, and five catties of water, mixed evenly, to brush the walls and ceilings twice. Flies and mosquitoes that come into contact with walls brushed with this medicated powder generally experience poisoning within three hours, resulting in death. Houses brushed with 666 medicine and whitewash can not only eliminate flies and mosquitoes, but also eliminate bedbugs. It also looks clean and white on all sides, making people feel refreshed. It is very cheap to brush walls with this method, costing only two or three dimes per room.

Flies and mosquitoes have a wide range of activity. Those that fly into the room can be eliminated by the above methods; those outside the room must be dealt with by other methods. According to general rules, some mosquitoes and flies like to inhabit under the eaves, and more flies like to forage in toilets, trash cans, and other places. In these places, 6% wettable 666 powder can be mixed with nineteen times the amount of clean water, stirred evenly, and sprayed. In places such as manure piles and garbage dumps that are prone to attracting flies and breeding maggots, fly traps can be used; in places with fewer flies, trapping methods can also be used in order to eliminate them completely. For example, use smelly fish, rotten shrimp, or stinky tofu to attract flies and then annihilate them in a concentrated manner.

The fundamental method of eliminating mosquitoes and flies is to prevent them from breeding and multiplying. Such as treating stagnant water pits, turning over pots and pouring out cans, clearing rainwater after rain, and eliminating mosquito larvae—wrigglers; improving toilets, disposing of feces in a timely manner to prevent maggots, and improving environmental sanitation and clearing garbage.

In short, fully mobilize the masses, everyone catches and swats, every household fumigates and brushes, and earnestly and thoroughly eliminate the breeding conditions of mosquitoes and flies. We will surely be able to let mosquitoes and flies die without descendants!

    让蚊蝇断子绝孙
    北京市爱国卫生运动委员会副主任　顾德
    最近，首都人民在卫生突击运动中，使用了熏、刷、喷、打、除等土洋结合的办法，消灭了大量的蚊子和苍蝇。
    过去，人们都习惯用蚊香、火绳、艾叶等来熏蚊子。虽然当时把蚊子和苍蝇都熏跑了，但是并没有消灭它们。现在，大家改用药品来熏蚊蝇。这个办法，不是把蚊蝇熏跑不咬自己就算了，而是要歼灭它们。
    白天，蚊子喜欢躲藏在阴暗、潮湿的地方休息，一到黄昏就出来大肆活动。当它们飞聚在一起交配以后，雌蚊就要想法咬人吸血，以供卵巢发育产卵。根据蚊子这个习性，应该在黄昏的时候，打开住室的门、窗和电灯，诱蚊入室，以便聚而歼之。歼灭的办法是：在一间普通的房屋里，用三十克6％的可湿性六六六粉或六六六烟熏剂，把药点燃，使药品发散出来的浓烟弥漫室内各角落，然后把门窗密闭。当蚊子接触到浓烟以后，它的中枢神经就会中毒麻痹而死亡。经过密闭半小时到一个小时以后，把门窗打开通风，人才能再进入室内，否则人也会中毒。
    与蚊子活动的规律相反，苍蝇在白天最活跃。当苍蝇接触了粪便等脏东西后飞到室内来的时候，总喜欢在墙壁、顶棚等地方停落。过去，人们常在墙壁上喷射一些滴滴涕等杀虫剂。这个办法虽然有效，但是用药量大，花钱多。现在，人们改用6％的可湿性六六六粉加大白粉刷墙壁，杀灭苍蝇的效果很好。在普通家庭里，一般房间用四两药、四斤大白、五斤水，搅拌均匀，把墙壁、顶棚粉刷两遍。苍蝇、蚊子接触了这种用药粉刷过的墙壁，一般在三个小时以后，就会发生中毒现象，以致死亡。用六六六药加大白粉刷过的房屋，不仅能消灭苍蝇和蚊子，而且还可以连臭虫一并被消灭掉。看起来也四壁洁白、干净，使人感到精神舒畅。用这种方法刷墙很便宜，一间房屋只用两、三角钱就够了。
    苍蝇、蚊子活动的范围很广。飞入室内的可以用以上方法消灭；在室外的，就须用另外的方法。按照一般规律，有些蚊子、苍蝇喜欢在屋檐下栖息，更多的苍蝇则喜欢到厕所、垃圾箱等处觅食。在这些地方，可以用6％的可湿性六六六粉加入十九倍清水，搅拌均匀后，进行喷射。在容易招蝇、生蛆的粪堆、垃圾堆等地方，可以用捕蝇笼；在苍蝇较少的地方，还可以用诱捕的方法，以便彻底消灭它。如用臭鱼、烂虾或臭豆腐，把苍蝇招引来，集中歼灭。
    消灭蚊子、苍蝇的治本方法，是不让它们孳生繁殖。如处理积水坑、翻盆倒罐，清除雨后积水，消灭蚊幼虫——孑孓；改善厕所，及时处理粪便，防止生蛆，以及改善环境卫生，清除垃圾等。
    总之，充分发动群众，人人捕打，家家熏刷，认真地、彻底地杜绝蚊蝇的孳生条件，一定能让蚊蝇断子断孙！
