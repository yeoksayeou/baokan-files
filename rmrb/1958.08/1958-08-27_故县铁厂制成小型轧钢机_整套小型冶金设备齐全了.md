Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, 26th - The local state-owned Guxian Iron Plant in Shanxi Province recently successfully trial-produced a small rolling mill. This rolling mill does not require a heating furnace, ring-shaped raceway, roughing mill, or cooling bed. It only needs a 10-horsepower boiler-locomotive engine or electric motor for power. Once the rolling mill is running, 32 mm steel ingots are clamped and fed into the rolling mill, and round steel, flat steel, and strip steel under 25 mm can be quickly rolled out. It can also cold-roll wire rod under 12 mm. Its daily output reaches 3.5 tons.

This rolling mill only requires five people to operate. It is installed on a steel plate and can be moved around with a small flatbed car, making it very suitable for small iron and steel joint enterprises. This equipment, together with the plant's previously created indigenous methods of coke production, indigenous kilns for firing refractory bricks, "mobile" indigenous blast furnaces, and hand-cranked small steelmaking converters, can form a complete set of small-scale smelting equipment for ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling.

　　故县铁厂制成小型轧钢机
    整套小型冶金设备齐全了
    新华社长治26日电　山西省地方国营故县铁厂最近试制成功一台小型轧钢机。这台轧钢机不用加热炉、环形滚道、粗轧和冷床等设备，只用一部十马力的锅驼机或电动机做动力。轧钢机运转起来后，用钳子把三十二米厘的钢锭钳住送进轧辊里，很快就可以轧出二十五米厘以下的圆钢、扁钢、带钢，还可以冷轧出十二米厘以下的盘条。它的日产量达三吨半。
    这台轧钢机仅用五个人操作，它被安装在一块钢板上，用一辆小平车就可以到处搬运，很适合于小型钢铁联合企业使用。这台设备和这个厂过去创造的土法炼焦、土窑烧耐火砖、“移动式”土高炉，手摇炼钢小转炉连在一起，可以成为一套完整的炼铁、炼钢、轧钢小型冶炼设备。
