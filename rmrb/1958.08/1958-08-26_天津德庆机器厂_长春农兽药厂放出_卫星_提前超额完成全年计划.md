Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 24th: The jointly owned public-private Deqing Machine Factory has launched the first "satellite" in Tianjin's industrial plan fulfillment—completing this year's Great Leap Forward plan five months ahead of schedule, equivalent to about 250% of last year's total output value.

　　This factory has only thirty-two employees and rudimentary equipment. Therefore, when the factory planned this spring to leap from last year's output value of over 180,000 yuan to 450,000 yuan this year, many people expressed doubt. The plan fulfillment was not good in January, February, and March. Later, the factory's leaders directed the workers' enthusiasm toward improving technology, mobilizing everyone to put forward innovation proposals and break through backward links. The main reason for poor plan fulfillment in March was the low output of iron pipes. Other parts could not be assembled into chains after they were produced. Originally, these iron pipes were made by drilling holes in round iron on a lathe, and one lathe could only produce two hundred pipes a day, which was very tight. Later, they learned from Shanghai's method—changing from hollowing out round iron to using a punching machine to roll iron plates into pipes. This immediately increased iron pipe production tenfold and saved the country 24 tons of steel. As a result, production in April quickly increased, with the total output value for the month equaling the total output value for the first three months. By the last day of July, the annual Great Leap Forward plan had been exceeded by 0.44%.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, the factory's employees have now put forward a new slogan of struggle: Launch a major technical revolution, realize the automation of punching machines and lathes, and the mechanization of fitters. They are determined to produce chain worth more than 70 million yuan from August to the end of the year, increasing this year's output value and output sevenfold compared to last year, achieving a qualified product rate of 99.8%, catching up with Shanghai's product quality by the end of the year, and reducing costs by half compared to last year. All employees of the factory have also set out conditions to challenge factories in Tianjin.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 24th: The Changchun Agricultural and Veterinary Drug Factory, in the Great Leap Forward, has resolved the contradictions between production and capital construction, trial production of new products and mass production. It has already overfulfilled this year's output value plan and profit delivery plan, setting a red flag in the city's factories and enterprises.

　　According to statistics, as of August 20, the factory had completed an output value of 2,353,000 yuan, exceeding the annual state plan by 18%; and delivered 306,000 yuan in profits, fulfilling the annual state plan by 193.4%.

　　The Changchun Agricultural and Veterinary Drug Factory was expanded this year from the veterinary drug workshop of the Changchun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory. The output value plan initially determined for this workshop at the beginning of the year was over 900,000 yuan. After several Great Leap Forwards, it was raised to 1,980,000 yuan. To complete such a large production plan, it was quite difficult to rely solely on the original equipment. Therefore, the factory decided to expand the plant and expand production. However, expansion takes time, which created a contradiction between the Great Leap Forward in production and capital construction. Factory leaders and employees actively implemented the policy of building factories diligently and frugally, adopting simple and crude methods to expand production while building new factory buildings.

　　The product varieties of the Agricultural and Veterinary Drug Factory have increased from more than 30 at the beginning of the year to more than 170 now. New products sell very well, and they must be quickly produced in batches after successful trial production. However, to produce in batches, there is a lack of sufficient equipment, so employees use indigenous methods and indigenous equipment to solve this contradiction. After adopting indigenous methods, employees vigorously improved technology to further increase output.

　　The Changchun Agricultural and Veterinary Drug Factory has now put forward a new Great Leap Forward goal of overfulfilling the state plan by one to one and a half times by the end of the year.

　　天津德庆机器厂  长春农兽药厂放出“卫星”
    提前超额完成全年计划
    据新华社天津24日电　公私合营德庆机器厂放出了天津市工业完成计划中的第一颗“卫星”——提前五个月完成了今年跃进计划产值，约相当去年全年产值的250％。
    这个工厂只有三十二名职工，设备简陋。因此，当今春这个厂计划要把今年的产值从去年的十八万多元跃进到四十五万元时，很多人表示怀疑。在一、二、三月份，完成计划也不好。后来，厂的领导干部接着便把工人的热情引向改进技术上去，发动大家提革新建议，突破落后环节。3月份计划完成不好的主要原因是铁管产量少，别的部件生产出来也不能装成链子。这种铁管原来是用元铁在车床上钻眼掏成的，一部床子一天掏二百个管，还很紧张。后来他们学习了上海的办法——由元铁掏孔改成铁板捣机圈管，一下就把铁管生产提高了十倍，还为国家节约了二十四吨钢材。4月份的生产因此很快就长上去了，全月产值等于第一季度三个月产值的总和。到7月的最后一天，就超额0.44％完成了全年跃进计划。
    这个厂的职工在党的领导下，现在提出了新的奋战口号：大闹技术革命，实现冲床车床自动化，钳工机械化，决心从8月份到年底，再生产总值七千多万元的链条，使今年的产值和产量比去年跃增七倍，正品率达到99.8％，产品质量年底赶上上海产品，成本比去年降低一半。全厂职工并订出条件，向天津市各工厂提出挑战。
    据新华社长春24日电　长春市农兽药厂在大跃进中解决了生产和基本建设、新产品试制和大量生产的矛盾，已经超额完成今年的产值计划和上缴利润计划，在全市工厂企业中树起一面红旗。
    据统计，到8月20日止，全厂完成产值二百三十五万三千元，超过全年国家计划18％；上缴利润三十万六千元，完成全年国家计划193.4％。
    长春农兽药厂是今年由长春化学制药厂兽药车间扩建成的。这个车间年初确定的产值计划是九十多万元，经过几次跃进，提高到一百九十八万元。要完成这样大的生产计划，仅仅依靠原有设备是相当困难的，于是工厂决定扩建厂房，扩大生产。但是，扩建需要一定的时间，这就产生了生产大跃进和基本建设的矛盾。工厂领导干部和职工们积极地贯彻勤俭办厂的方针，采取因陋就简的办法，在新厂房建设的同时，努力扩大生产。
    农兽药厂的产品品种，由年初的三十多种增加到现在的一百七十多种。新产品销路很好，试制成功后就要迅速成批生产。但要成批生产，缺少足够的设备，职工们就采用土办法、土设备来解决这个矛盾。职工们在采取土法以后，又大力改进技术，进一步提高产量。
    长春农兽药厂现在又提出了到年底超额一倍到一倍半完成国家计划的新的跃进目标。
