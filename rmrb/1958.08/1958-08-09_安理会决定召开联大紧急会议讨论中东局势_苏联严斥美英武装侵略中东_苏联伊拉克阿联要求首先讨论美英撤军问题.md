Xinhua News Agency, August 8th report from TASS, New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 7th and unanimously adopted a proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Middle East issue. After the Security Council vote, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld announced that the General Assembly's emergency special session would be held on the afternoon of the 8th. The Security Council's meeting on the 7th was convened at the request of the Soviet Union, which suggested convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan.

George-Picot (France), serving as chairman, presided over the opening of the meeting. He announced that the United Nations Secretary-General considered the credentials of Habum Jawad, the representative of the government of the Republic of Iraq, to be sufficient. Jawad delivered a brief speech, saying that the patriotic movement of the Iraqi army, supported by people all over the world, led to the establishment of the Republic of Iraq. The aim of this movement was to free Iraq from the rule of reactionaries. He said that the government of the Republic intends to abide by its international obligations and the United Nations Charter, and to maintain and develop friendly relations with all countries in the world.

After determining the agenda of the meeting, Soviet representative Sobolev spoke.

He said that the Security Council, due to its current composition and the policies of the United States, has been paralyzed and proven incapable of taking immediate measures to stop the aggression and withdraw US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government had proposed the rapid convening of a five-nation summit meeting with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General to take immediate and effective measures to stop the military conflict that had begun in the Arab East. However, the US and British governments ignored the demands of world opinion and, in essence, undermined the convening of such a meeting. Therefore, they bear a grave responsibility to the people of all countries.

The Soviet representative reminded the Security Council that the US and British acts of aggression in the Near East are continuing. The United States and Britain repeatedly stated that they would soon withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, but in reality, they are continuing to send new troops to these countries. At the same time, the "Baghdad Pact" countries are implementing new military measures aimed at preparing a base for expanding aggression against Arab countries. The number of troops at US and British bases in the region is increasing daily. Currently, 70,000 troops are concentrated in the Near East and its neighboring areas, and there are 1,000 aircraft at US and British air bases and aircraft carriers in the region. The two countries have 120 warships and landing ships in the region.

Sobolev said that, therefore, the world is still not free from the danger of escalating conflict in the Near and Middle East. This cannot but arouse the concern of all those who hope to stop foreign interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

The Soviet representative pointed out that attempts to defend US-British aggression by citing domestic events in Iraq and the so-called threat to Lebanon from the United Arab Republic and so-called "indirect aggression" are completely untenable. He stressed that the tricks to undermine the Republic of Iraq have completely failed, and the United States and Britain themselves have had to recognize the new Iraqi government.

Sobolev said that the determination of the people of all countries and peace-loving countries to stop aggression against the Near East has forced the planners of armed intervention to refrain, at this stage, from expanding the aggression to other countries, primarily to the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. However, the Western countries' formal recognition of the Republic of Iraq does not mean that the danger of the expansion and escalation of the conflict in the region has now been completely eliminated and that the security of Iraq and other Arab countries has been guaranteed. The problem of completely stopping armed intervention in the Near and Middle East and creating conditions there that would protect the people of this region from foreign interference remains to be urgently resolved.

Sobolev said that foreign troops should withdraw from Jordan and Lebanon, and they should withdraw immediately! Their presence in the region is a constant threat to peace and the independence of nations, and an intolerable violation of the United Nations Charter, which the members of the United Nations must not tolerate.

Sobolev continued that if the United Nations does not take the necessary measures at this critical moment and continues to yield to the aggressors, it will irretrievably lose its prestige and trust among the peoples of all countries, and the world may fall into the abyss of a new world war.

The Soviet representative then demanded the rapid convening of an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and put forward a corresponding proposal.

US representative Lodge, in his speech, tried his best to defend the US act of aggression against Lebanon. He repeated the hackneyed phrases of so-called "threat to the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon" and "indirect aggression," and attempted to shift the blame for delaying the holding of a summit meeting to the Soviet Union. Lodge said that the US could not accept the Soviet proposal because the mention of the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon was "unconstructive." Lodge put forward a proposal that insisted on describing the convening of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly as a discussion of the so-called accusations by Lebanon and Jordan against the United Arab Republic for "interfering in their internal affairs."

British representative Dixon, who spoke after Lodge, expressed his support for the US position.

Iraqi Republic representative Jawad then spoke, saying that although the Security Council began studying the Middle East situation due to Lebanon's complaint, the landing of US troops had fundamentally changed the essence of the problem, and the landing of British troops in Jordan further complicated the crisis. He said that a situation had formed that undoubtedly threatened world peace.

Jawad emphasized that the Security Council was not capable of eliminating this threat. He pointed out that both the Soviet and US draft resolutions stipulated the convening of an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly.

He said, however, that the General Assembly must first discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Jawad further emphasized that the presence of foreign troops in those countries violated the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter.

Jawad concluded by saying that he could not support the US proposal because the reason it put forward for convening the General Assembly was the unfounded accusations of Lebanon and Jordan against the United Arab Republic. He said that the discussion of the Middle East situation could not be limited solely to the study of these accusations.

Canadian representative Ritchie supported the US proposal and expressed the hope that it would be possible to arrange informal meetings between representatives of major powers and relevant countries during the General Assembly session, where the entire Middle East issue would be discussed and resolved fruitfully.

United Arab Republic representative Lutfi supported the Iraqi delegation's attitude towards convening a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Middle East situation caused by the entry of US troops into Lebanon and British troops into Jordan. He stressed that the US motion to convene a General Assembly meeting and its mention of Lebanon and Jordan's accusations were unfounded and did not provide a basis for convening and conducting an emergency special session and making a decision.

Lutfi recalled certain paragraphs in the report of the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon that denied any interference by the United Arab Republic in Lebanon's internal affairs. He said that US representative Lodge had ignored these conclusions reached by a United Nations body.

Lutfi said that the ongoing entry of US troops into Lebanon and British troops into Jordan must be the fundamental and primary issue to be discussed at the special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, because the presence of these troops in Lebanon and Jordan is a threat to peace and security.

Next, Soviet representative Sobolev commented on the speeches of the US and British representatives.

Speaking about Lodge's so-called "threat" to Lebanon, Sobolev pointed out that before the US armed intervention in Lebanon, the Security Council had discussed Lebanon's complaint and the Security Council had not determined the existence of such a threat, and only the Security Council and the United Nations could determine the existence of a threat to peace and the security of a country. He said that the so-called "threat" to Lebanon was fabricated by the US government in order to use it as a false pretext for US armed intervention in Lebanese affairs.

He said that only after US troops invaded Lebanon and British troops invaded Jordan was there a real threat to peace and security in that region.

Sobolev emphasized that the US proposal for the accusations of Lebanon and Jordan ignored the main issue to be discussed‚Äîthe withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He demanded that the Soviet proposal be voted on first.

Security Council President George-Picot said that the French government still believes that the Middle East issue should be discussed calmly at a summit meeting of heads of government, as initially suggested by the Soviet government. The French government believes that every effort must be made to make such a meeting possible. At the same time, the French delegation does not object to convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly and will vote in favor of the US proposal.

As the general debate was about to end, Soviet representative Sobolev proposed an amendment to the US proposal. He suggested deleting the first paragraph of the preamble of this proposal. This paragraph states: The Security Council, "having examined the complaints of Lebanon and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan."

Sobolev also proposed an amendment to the substantive part, which, as amended, would read as follows:

The Security Council decides to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 8, Section B of the Rules of Procedure of the United Nations General Assembly.

US representative Lodge opposed the first amendment proposed by the Soviet representative but accepted the second amendment.

At the motion of the representative of Panama, the Security Council adjourned briefly to enable the representatives to study the Soviet amendments.

After the adjournment and a brief discussion of the amendments, the Security Council unanimously agreed to the following wording of the Security Council draft resolution:

"The Security Council,

Having examined items 2 and 3 on the agenda of the 838th meeting,

Considering that the permanent members of the Security Council have failed to reach unanimity at the Security Council's 834th and 837th meetings, so that the Security Council cannot assume its primary responsibility for maintaining world peace and security,

Decides to convene a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly."

The Security Council unanimously adopted this draft resolution.

Sobolev said after the vote that the Soviet Union did not insist on having its proposal voted on.

Sobolev said: "The Soviet delegation voted in favor of holding a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet delegation believes that the main task of this special emergency session will be to take measures to ease international tensions, which are mainly caused by the sending of troops by the United States and Britain to Lebanon and Jordan."

The Soviet representative recalled what Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev said to British Prime Minister Macmillan in his letter of August 5 this year: The Soviet government hopes that the United Nations General Assembly, with the participation of representatives from both large and small countries, will be able to find a way to eliminate the danger of war caused by the actions of Britain and the United States in the Near and Middle East, and to bring peace to the region.

Before the Security Council adjourned, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld told the representatives of the Security Council members that the letter concerning the Security Council's decision to convene a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly would be sent to all members of the United Nations on the night of the 7th. He said that the United Nations General Assembly would be held on August 8 at 5 p.m. New York time.
