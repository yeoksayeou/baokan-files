Xinhua News Agency, August 8th report from TASS, New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 7th and unanimously adopted a proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Middle East issue. After the Security Council vote, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld announced that the General Assembly's emergency special session would be held on the afternoon of the 8th. The Security Council's meeting on the 7th was convened at the request of the Soviet Union, which suggested convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan.

George-Picot (France), serving as chairman, presided over the opening of the meeting. He announced that the United Nations Secretary-General considered the credentials of Habum Jawad, the representative of the government of the Republic of Iraq, to be sufficient. Jawad delivered a brief speech, saying that the patriotic movement of the Iraqi army, supported by people all over the world, led to the establishment of the Republic of Iraq. The aim of this movement was to free Iraq from the rule of reactionaries. He said that the government of the Republic intends to abide by its international obligations and the United Nations Charter, and to maintain and develop friendly relations with all countries in the world.

After determining the agenda of the meeting, Soviet representative Sobolev spoke.

He said that the Security Council, due to its current composition and the policies of the United States, has been paralyzed and proven incapable of taking immediate measures to stop the aggression and withdraw US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government had proposed the rapid convening of a five-nation summit meeting with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General to take immediate and effective measures to stop the military conflict that had begun in the Arab East. However, the US and British governments ignored the demands of world opinion and, in essence, undermined the convening of such a meeting. Therefore, they bear a grave responsibility to the people of all countries.

The Soviet representative reminded the Security Council that the US and British acts of aggression in the Near East are continuing. The United States and Britain repeatedly stated that they would soon withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, but in reality, they are continuing to send new troops to these countries. At the same time, the "Baghdad Pact" countries are implementing new military measures aimed at preparing a base for expanding aggression against Arab countries. The number of troops at US and British bases in the region is increasing daily. Currently, 70,000 troops are concentrated in the Near East and its neighboring areas, and there are 1,000 aircraft at US and British air bases and aircraft carriers in the region. The two countries have 120 warships and landing ships in the region.

Sobolev said that, therefore, the world is still not free from the danger of escalating conflict in the Near and Middle East. This cannot but arouse the concern of all those who hope to stop foreign interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

The Soviet representative pointed out that attempts to defend US-British aggression by citing domestic events in Iraq and the so-called threat to Lebanon from the United Arab Republic and so-called "indirect aggression" are completely untenable. He stressed that the tricks to undermine the Republic of Iraq have completely failed, and the United States and Britain themselves have had to recognize the new Iraqi government.

Sobolev said that the determination of the people of all countries and peace-loving countries to stop aggression against the Near East has forced the planners of armed intervention to refrain, at this stage, from expanding the aggression to other countries, primarily to the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. However, the Western countries' formal recognition of the Republic of Iraq does not mean that the danger of the expansion and escalation of the conflict in the region has now been completely eliminated and that the security of Iraq and other Arab countries has been guaranteed. The problem of completely stopping armed intervention in the Near and Middle East and creating conditions there that would protect the people of this region from foreign interference remains to be urgently resolved.

Sobolev said that foreign troops should withdraw from Jordan and Lebanon, and they should withdraw immediately! Their presence in the region is a constant threat to peace and the independence of nations, and an intolerable violation of the United Nations Charter, which the members of the United Nations must not tolerate.

Sobolev continued that if the United Nations does not take the necessary measures at this critical moment and continues to yield to the aggressors, it will irretrievably lose its prestige and trust among the peoples of all countries, and the world may fall into the abyss of a new world war.

The Soviet representative then demanded the rapid convening of an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and put forward a corresponding proposal.

US representative Lodge, in his speech, tried his best to defend the US act of aggression against Lebanon. He repeated the hackneyed phrases of so-called "threat to the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon" and "indirect aggression," and attempted to shift the blame for delaying the holding of a summit meeting to the Soviet Union. Lodge said that the US could not accept the Soviet proposal because the mention of the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon was "unconstructive." Lodge put forward a proposal that insisted on describing the convening of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly as a discussion of the so-called accusations by Lebanon and Jordan against the United Arab Republic for "interfering in their internal affairs."

British representative Dixon, who spoke after Lodge, expressed his support for the US position.

Iraqi Republic representative Jawad then spoke, saying that although the Security Council began studying the Middle East situation due to Lebanon's complaint, the landing of US troops had fundamentally changed the essence of the problem, and the landing of British troops in Jordan further complicated the crisis. He said that a situation had formed that undoubtedly threatened world peace.

Jawad emphasized that the Security Council was not capable of eliminating this threat. He pointed out that both the Soviet and US draft resolutions stipulated the convening of an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly.

He said, however, that the General Assembly must first discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Jawad further emphasized that the presence of foreign troops in those countries violated the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter.

Jawad concluded by saying that he could not support the US proposal because the reason it put forward for convening the General Assembly was the unfounded accusations of Lebanon and Jordan against the United Arab Republic. He said that the discussion of the Middle East situation could not be limited solely to the study of these accusations.

Canadian representative Ritchie supported the US proposal and expressed the hope that it would be possible to arrange informal meetings between representatives of major powers and relevant countries during the General Assembly session, where the entire Middle East issue would be discussed and resolved fruitfully.

United Arab Republic representative Lutfi supported the Iraqi delegation's attitude towards convening a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Middle East situation caused by the entry of US troops into Lebanon and British troops into Jordan. He stressed that the US motion to convene a General Assembly meeting and its mention of Lebanon and Jordan's accusations were unfounded and did not provide a basis for convening and conducting an emergency special session and making a decision.

Lutfi recalled certain paragraphs in the report of the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon that denied any interference by the United Arab Republic in Lebanon's internal affairs. He said that US representative Lodge had ignored these conclusions reached by a United Nations body.

Lutfi said that the ongoing entry of US troops into Lebanon and British troops into Jordan must be the fundamental and primary issue to be discussed at the special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, because the presence of these troops in Lebanon and Jordan is a threat to peace and security.

Next, Soviet representative Sobolev commented on the speeches of the US and British representatives.

Speaking about Lodge's so-called "threat" to Lebanon, Sobolev pointed out that before the US armed intervention in Lebanon, the Security Council had discussed Lebanon's complaint and the Security Council had not determined the existence of such a threat, and only the Security Council and the United Nations could determine the existence of a threat to peace and the security of a country. He said that the so-called "threat" to Lebanon was fabricated by the US government in order to use it as a false pretext for US armed intervention in Lebanese affairs.

He said that only after US troops invaded Lebanon and British troops invaded Jordan was there a real threat to peace and security in that region.

Sobolev emphasized that the US proposal for the accusations of Lebanon and Jordan ignored the main issue to be discussed—the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He demanded that the Soviet proposal be voted on first.

Security Council President George-Picot said that the French government still believes that the Middle East issue should be discussed calmly at a summit meeting of heads of government, as initially suggested by the Soviet government. The French government believes that every effort must be made to make such a meeting possible. At the same time, the French delegation does not object to convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly and will vote in favor of the US proposal.

As the general debate was about to end, Soviet representative Sobolev proposed an amendment to the US proposal. He suggested deleting the first paragraph of the preamble of this proposal. This paragraph states: The Security Council, "having examined the complaints of Lebanon and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan."

Sobolev also proposed an amendment to the substantive part, which, as amended, would read as follows:

The Security Council decides to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 8, Section B of the Rules of Procedure of the United Nations General Assembly.

US representative Lodge opposed the first amendment proposed by the Soviet representative but accepted the second amendment.

At the motion of the representative of Panama, the Security Council adjourned briefly to enable the representatives to study the Soviet amendments.

After the adjournment and a brief discussion of the amendments, the Security Council unanimously agreed to the following wording of the Security Council draft resolution:

"The Security Council,

Having examined items 2 and 3 on the agenda of the 838th meeting,

Considering that the permanent members of the Security Council have failed to reach unanimity at the Security Council's 834th and 837th meetings, so that the Security Council cannot assume its primary responsibility for maintaining world peace and security,

Decides to convene a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly."

The Security Council unanimously adopted this draft resolution.

Sobolev said after the vote that the Soviet Union did not insist on having its proposal voted on.

Sobolev said: "The Soviet delegation voted in favor of holding a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet delegation believes that the main task of this special emergency session will be to take measures to ease international tensions, which are mainly caused by the sending of troops by the United States and Britain to Lebanon and Jordan."

The Soviet representative recalled what Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev said to British Prime Minister Macmillan in his letter of August 5 this year: The Soviet government hopes that the United Nations General Assembly, with the participation of representatives from both large and small countries, will be able to find a way to eliminate the danger of war caused by the actions of Britain and the United States in the Near and Middle East, and to bring peace to the region.

Before the Security Council adjourned, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld told the representatives of the Security Council members that the letter concerning the Security Council's decision to convene a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly would be sent to all members of the United Nations on the night of the 7th. He said that the United Nations General Assembly would be held on August 8 at 5 p.m. New York time.

    安理会决定召开联大紧急会议讨论中东局势
    苏联严斥美英武装侵略中东
    苏联伊拉克阿联要求首先讨论美英撤军问题
    新华社8日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会会议7日举行会议，会议一致通过一项提案，决定召开联合国大会紧急特别会议来讨论中东问题，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在安理会表决后宣布，大会紧急特别会议将在8日下午举行。安理会7日的会议是根据苏联的要求召开的，苏联建议召开联合国大会紧急特别会议来讨论美军撤出黎巴嫩、英军撤出约旦问题。
    担任主席的乔治—皮科（法国）主持会议开幕，他宣布说，联合国秘书长认为伊拉克共和国政府代表哈布姆·贾瓦德的代表权是充分的。贾瓦德发表了简短的讲话，他说，得到全世界人民支持的伊拉克军队的爱国运动导致伊拉克共和国的成立，这个运动的目的是要使伊拉克摆脱反动派的统治。他说，共和国政府打算遵守自己的国际义务和联合国宪章，并且维持和发展同世界各国的友好关系。
    在确定了会议议程之后，由苏联代表索波列夫发言。
    他说，安全理事会由于目前的成员以及美国的政策已经陷于瘫痪，证明没有能力采取立即制止侵略和使美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出的措施。在这种情况下，苏联政府曾经建议迅速召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议，立即采取有效措施制止在阿拉伯东方开始的军事冲突。但是美英政府忽视世界舆论的要求，实质上却破坏这种会议的召开，因此，它们对世界各国人民负有严重责任。
    苏联代表提醒安全理事会注意这样一个情况，就是美国和英国在近东的侵略行动仍在继续。美国和英国口口声声说即将从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军，而实际上却在继续往这些国家调遣新的军队。同时，“巴格达条约”国家在执行新的军事措施，这些措施的目的是为扩大对阿拉伯国家的侵略准备基地。这个地区的美国和英国基地上的军队的数目在日益增加。现在，近东及其邻近地区集结了七万军队，在美国和英国在这个地区的空军基地和航空母舰上有一千架飞机。这两个国家在这个地区的海军有一百二十艘战斗舰和登陆舰。
    索波列夫说，因此，世界仍然没有免除中近东冲突尖锐化的危险。这当然不能不引起一切希望停止外国对阿拉伯国家内政的干涉的人们的忧虑。
    苏联代表指出，有人企图以伊拉克国内事件以及借口黎巴嫩遭到阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓威胁和所谓“间接侵略”来为美英的侵略辩护，这种做法是完全站不住脚的。他着重指出，破坏伊拉克共和国的伎俩彻底失败了，美国和英国自己也不得不承认伊拉克新政府。
    索波列夫说，各国人民和爱好和平的国家要求制止对近东侵略的决心迫使武装干涉策划者在现阶段不敢把侵略扩大到其他国家去，首先是扩大到伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国去。但是，西方国家正式承认伊拉克共和国并不意味着这个地区的冲突扩大和尖锐化的危险现在已完全消除和伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家的安全已得到保障。完全制止对中近东的武装干涉和在那里创造使这个地区的各国人民免遭外国干涉的条件的问题仍然急待解决。
    索波列夫说，外国军队应该从约旦和黎巴嫩撤退，而且要立即撤退！他们在这个地区的驻扎是对和平和各国人民的独立的经常性威胁，并且是对联合国宪章的令人不能容忍的破坏，联合国会员国对此决不能容忍。
    索波列夫接着说，如果联合国在这紧急关头不采取必要措施，而且对侵略者继续让步，那么它将不可挽回地失去在各国人民中的威望和信任，而世界可能陷入新的世界大战的深渊。
    苏联代表接着要求迅速召开联合国大会紧急特别会议来讨论美国和英国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题，并且提出了相应的提案。
    美国代表洛奇在发言时竭力企图为美国对黎巴嫩的侵略行为辩护。他重复了所谓“黎巴嫩的独立和领土完整遭到威胁”和“间接侵略”的滥调，并且企图把拖延召开最高级会议的罪过推给苏联。洛奇说，苏联的提案美国不能接受，因为其中提到要美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩这一点是“非建设性”的。洛奇提出了一项提案，这个提案硬要把召开联合国大会紧急特别会议说成是为了讨论所谓黎巴嫩和约旦对阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉它们的内政”的控诉。
    接着洛奇发言的英国代表狄克逊表示支持美国的立场。
    伊拉克共和国代表贾瓦德接着发言，他说，虽然安全理事会是由于黎巴嫩提出的控诉而开始研究中东局势的，但是美军的登陆已经从根本上改变了问题的实质，而英国军队在约旦着陆进一步使这个危机复杂化了。他说，已经形成了一种无疑是对世界和平的威胁的局势。
    贾瓦德强调安全理事会没有能力来消除这种威胁。他指出苏联和美国的决议草案都规定要召开联合国大会紧急特别会议。
    他说，但是，大会必须首先讨论外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。
    贾瓦德进一步强调指出，外国军队驻在那些国家是违反联合国宪章的文字和精神的。
    贾瓦德最后说，他不能够支持美国提案，因为它所提出的召开大会的原因是黎巴嫩和约旦对阿拉伯联合共和国的毫无根据的控诉。他说，对中东局势的讨论不能够仅仅局限于研究这些控诉。
    加拿大代表里奇支持美国提案，并且表示希望，在大会会议期间有可能安排各大国和有关国家代表间的非正式会议，在这些会议上，整个中东问题将会得到有成果的讨论和解决。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲支持伊拉克代表团对于召开联合国大会特别紧急会议以讨论由于美军进驻黎巴嫩和英军进驻约旦所造成的中东局势问题的态度。他强调指出，美国要求召开大会会议的动议及其提到黎巴嫩和约旦的控诉的那番话是没有根据的，它并不能为召开和进行一次紧急特别会议并作出决定提供一个基础。
    卢特菲追述了在黎巴嫩的联合国观察团的报告里否认阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩内政进行过任何干涉的某些段落。他说美国代表洛奇对于一个联合国机构所得出的这些结论竟然置之不顾。
    卢特菲说，现在还在继续进行的美军进驻黎巴嫩和英军进驻约旦的行动必须是联合国大会特别紧急会议应讨论的基本的和主要的问题，因为这些部队驻在黎巴嫩和约旦是对和平和安全的威胁。
    接着，苏联代表索波列夫评论了美英代表的发言。
    索波列夫谈到洛奇所谓黎巴嫩受到“威胁”时指出，在美国武装干涉黎巴嫩以前，安全理事会就讨论过黎巴嫩的控诉案，安理会并没有确定这样一种威胁的存在，而只有安理会和联合国才能确定对和平和对某一国家安全的威胁的存在。他说，所谓对黎巴嫩的“威胁”，是美国政府捏造的，为的是把这当作美国武装干涉黎巴嫩事务的虚伪借口。
    他说，只是在美国军队侵入黎巴嫩和英国军队侵入约旦之后，那个地区的和平与安全才受到了真正的威胁。
    索波列夫强调指出，美国提出的黎巴嫩和约旦的控诉的提案无视所要讨论的主要问题——美军和英军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。他要求先表决苏联的提案。 
    安全理事会主席乔治—皮科说，法国政府仍然认为，中东问题应该按照苏联政府第一个建议在政府首脑会议上心平气和地加以讨论。法国政府认为，必须尽一切力量使这样一次会议成为可能。同时，法国代表团并不反对召开联合国大会紧急特别会议，并且将投票赞成美国提案。
    在一般辩论即将结束时，苏联代表索波列夫对美国提案提出修正案。他建议把这个提案的序言的第一段删去。这一段说：安全理事会，“研究了黎巴嫩和约旦哈希姆王国的控诉”。
    索波列夫也对于实质部分提出了一项修正案，经过修正后，这一部分如下：
    安全理事会决定按照联合国大会议事程序第八条B款召开联合国大会紧急特别会议。
    美国代表洛奇反对苏联代表的第一个修正案，但是接受了第二个修正案。
    根据巴拿马代表的动议，安全理事会进行短时间的休会，使代表们能够研究苏联的修正案。
    在休会和就修正案进行简短的讨论之后，安全理事会一致同意安全理事会决议草案的下列措词：
    “安全理事会，
    研究了第八百三十八次会议议程上的第二和第三项，
    考虑到在安全理事会第八百三十四次和第八百三十七次会议上，常任理事国未能取得一致意见，以致安全理事会不能承担它的维护世界和平和安全的主要责任，
    决定召开一次联合国大会特别紧急会议。”
    安全理事会一致通过了这个决议草案。
    索波列夫在表决之后说，苏联并没有坚持要把它的提案进行表决。
    索波列夫说：“苏联代表团投票赞成举行联合国大会特别紧急会议。苏联代表团认为这次特别紧急会议的主要任务将是采取措施缓和国际紧张局势，这种局势主要是由美英两国派兵到黎巴嫩和约旦所造成的。”
    这位苏联代表追述苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在他今年8月5日的函件中对联合王国首相麦克米伦所说的话说：苏联政府希望，既有大国也有小国代表参加的联合国大会对这个问题的讨论能够寻找出办法来消除英国和美国的行动在中近东造成的战争危险，并给这个地区带来安宁。
    在安全理事会休会之前，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德对安理会理事国的代表们说，关于安全理事会决定召开联合国大会特别紧急会议的函件将于7日夜间发给联合国各会员国。他说，联合国大会将于8月8日纽约时间十七点举行。
