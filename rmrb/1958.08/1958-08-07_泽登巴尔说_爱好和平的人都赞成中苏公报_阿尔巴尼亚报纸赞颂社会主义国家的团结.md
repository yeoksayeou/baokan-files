The editorials pointed out that the unity of socialist countries is a reliable guarantee for the cause of socialism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and all Marxist-Leninist parties in the socialist camp are waging a resolute struggle for this sacred unity, for defending the principles of the Moscow Declaration, and against the revisionism of the Yugoslav leadership group. The Sino-Soviet communiqué inspires the Albanian people to achieve new successes in the struggle for building a new life, for peace and socialism.
