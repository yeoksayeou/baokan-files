Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 24th: Former Jordanian Minister of National Economy of the Nabulsi government and former member of parliament, Abdul Hadi, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and government for supporting the Jordanian people's struggle when he met with Xinhua reporters on the 23rd.

Hadi, who could not bear the persecution of Hussein's petty court, arrived in Damascus from Jordan on August 11. He introduced the domestic situation in Jordan to the reporter. He said that Jordan is currently "a huge concentration camp. Arrests are being carried out everywhere every day." He estimated that about 20,000 Jordanians have been arrested by the Hussein dynasty.

Hadi said that the Hussein petty court's persecution of the Jordanian people is extremely cruel. Hussein's henchmen often pull out people's fingernails, whip bare feet, and often knock out prisoners' teeth. Even more appalling, sometimes the "criminal's" hands are tied to two horses separately, and then the horses are whipped to run in opposite directions.

When talking about the measures taken by the Hussein dynasty to suppress the people, Hadi also said that in Nablus and Amman, Hussein has hundreds of patrols patrolling the streets day and night. Each patrol consists of three Bedouins and one policeman. He said that patrols persecute anyone who laughs. He cited an example that after the revolution in Iraq, two people were sitting in a barbershop laughing because they were happy about the success of the Iraqi revolution. When the patrol knew about this situation, they beat up the two people. Hadi said: "Therefore, Jordanians don't know what to do. Smiling and crying are both prohibited."

When talking about the Jordanian regime, which is abandoned by all, Hadi pointed out that it can be said with certainty that in Jordan, only a very small number of privileged people, less than 0.5%, support the Hussein dynasty. He said: The Jordanian people "are like a fire covered with ashes. As long as the ashes are brushed away, the fire will burn."

　　前约旦国民经济大臣哈迪说
    约旦革命火焰一触即发
    侯赛因残民以逞老百姓笑也有罪
    新华社大马士革24日电　前约旦纳布西政府国民经济大臣、前议员阿卜杜勒·哈迪23日在接见新华社记者时，对中国人民和政府支持约旦人民的斗争表示衷心的感谢。
    哈迪由于不堪侯赛因小朝廷的迫害，在8月11日从约旦到达大马士革。他向记者介绍了约旦国内的局势。他说，目前约旦“全国成了巨大的集中营。每天在各地都展开了逮捕运动。”据他估计，约有两万约旦人遭到侯赛因王朝的逮捕。
    哈迪说，侯赛因小朝廷对约旦人民的迫害是极为残忍的。侯赛因小朝廷的打手经常拔掉人们的指甲，鞭打赤裸的脚，常把囚犯的牙齿打掉。更令人发指的是，有时候把“犯人”的两只手分别捆在两头马的身上，然后鞭打两头马朝着相反方向跑。
    哈迪在谈到侯赛因王朝镇压人民的措施时还说，在纳布鲁斯和安曼，侯赛因有成百支巡逻队日夜在街头来回巡逻，每支巡逻队由三名贝都印人和一名警察组成。他说，巡逻队对所有发笑的人都要进行迫害。他举例说，在伊拉克发生革命以后，有两个人坐在理发店里因对伊拉克革命成功感到高兴而大笑，当巡逻队知道这种情况时，就把这两个人揍了一顿。哈迪说：“因此，约旦人不知道怎么作好，笑和哭都是受到禁止的。”
    哈迪谈到众叛亲离的约旦现政权时指出，可以肯定地说，在约旦居民中，只有不到0.5％的极少数享有特权的人才支持侯赛因王朝。他说：约旦人民“好像用灰盖着的火，只要把灰拨开，火就会燃烧。”
