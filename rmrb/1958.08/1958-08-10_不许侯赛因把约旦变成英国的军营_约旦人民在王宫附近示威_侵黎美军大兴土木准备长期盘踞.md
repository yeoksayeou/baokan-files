Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Cairo, August 8th: The Jordanian people are firmly opposed to the British army's occupation of Jordan and condemn King Hussein of Jordan's policy of turning Jordan into a British military camp, according to TASS.

The "Cairo Newspaper" wrote that a demonstration with many participants was held near the Royal Palace in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Demonstrators shouted slogans: "Jordan is for Jordanians!" "Imperialists get out of our country!" "Long live Arab nationalism!".

The newspaper wrote that police and troops were unable to stop the marches and demonstrations or disperse the marchers. The newspaper pointed out that Hussein's government is taking repressive measures and acts of terror and intimidation in an attempt to suppress the people's movement. The government has also established special courts, and now, a movement demanding the abolition of these anti-people's courts has been launched throughout Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Frankfurt, August 9th: Jordan's traitorous King Hussein, in a conversation with West German journalists, once again expressed his desire for the British invading forces to remain in Jordan for a long time to "protect" him, saying that the British invading forces should remain in Jordan until he "regains enough strength" to suppress the Jordanian people.

Hussein also admitted in an interview with a "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" reporter on August 8 that his dynasty is in "constant danger, even in my castle," due to the opposition of the domestic people and the rise of the Arab national liberation movement around Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Cairo, August 8th: According to "Izvestia," during the visit of U.S. President's "Special Envoy" Murphy to Jordan, King Hussein of Jordan requested him to send U.S. troops to Jordan.

The news said that on the other hand, Hussein told the British Command that the British troops stationed in Jordan were not enough and requested new reinforcements. According to the newspaper, Hussein complained that there was a strong sense of wavering among the Jordanian troops, so he could not rely on his army.

"Izvestia" wrote that the British government decided to rapidly dispatch new British troops to Jordan. These troops have arrived at the port of Aqaba. These troops were transported by sea from British colonies in Aden and East Africa. British troops were transported by plane from Aqaba to Amman. At the same time, British troops continue to be transported from Cyprus to Amman by air via Israeli airspace.

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Cairo, August 9th: A correspondent from the Middle East News Agency sent a message from Beirut on August 8 stating that various signs indicate that the U.S. invading forces are preparing to occupy Lebanon for a long time.

The correspondent of this news agency said that in the An-Nahr and Wadi Chahrour areas near Beirut, the U.S. occupation forces are building roads from their barracks to the avenues. The U.S. invading forces headquarters has rented several buildings in the Mahallah district of Beirut for use by various commands. One person said that the lease term for one of the buildings is five years.

The U.S. occupation authorities have also signed contracts with local merchants to supply materials for building barracks.

Another person said that the U.S. Air Force Command in Lebanon intends to build two airports, one south of Beirut and the other in Kasrwan, northwest of Beirut.

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Beirut, August 9th: The headquarters of the U.S. invading forces in Lebanon announced on August 8 that it had decided to allow approximately 2,000 U.S. invading officers and soldiers to enter the Beirut city area daily for "free recreation" starting from the 9th.

According to the "recreation" area designated by the headquarters of the U.S. invading forces, the U.S. invading forces will occupy the best beaches, the best hotels, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs in Beirut and run amok. Prior to this, U.S. news agencies admitted that the main "recreation" of the U.S. invading forces in Beirut was to vent their animal nature in brothels and ravage Lebanese women.

According to the Beirut "Star Daily," the U.S. invading forces are aware that they are universally hated by the Lebanese people and are therefore in a state of extreme tension and paranoia. This time, while allowing invading officers and soldiers to go for "recreation," they also specially dispatched medical personnel to inspect the food and beverages in Lebanese hotels and restaurants, and check the kitchen utensils in these places to prevent poisoning.

    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社开罗8日讯：约旦人民坚决反对英国军队占领约旦的行为，并且谴责约旦国王侯赛因把约旦变成英国军营的政策。
    “开罗报”写道，在约旦首都安曼的王宫附近，举行了一次有许多人参加的示威游行。示威者高呼口号：“约旦是约旦人的！”“帝国主义者从我国滚出去！”“阿拉伯民族主义万岁！”。
    报纸写道，警察和军队无法阻止游行示威和驱散游行者。报纸指出，侯赛因政府采取镇压措施以及恐怖和威胁行动，企图把人民运动压下去。政府还设立了一些特别法庭，现在，约旦全国各地掀起了要求取消这些反人民的法庭的运动。
    新华社9日讯　法兰克福消息：约旦的卖国国王侯赛因在对西德记者的一次谈话中再一次表示要英国侵略军长期留在约旦为他“保驾”，他说英国侵略军应该留在约旦，直到他“重新取得足够的力量”来镇压约旦人民为止。
    侯赛因8日在向“法兰克福汇报”记者发表的谈话中还承认，由于国内人民的反对和约旦周围阿拉伯民族解放运动的高涨，他的王朝处于“不断的危险中，甚至在我的城堡中也是这样”。
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社开罗8日讯：据“消息报”报道，在美国总统“特使”墨菲访问约旦期间，约旦国王侯赛因曾经向他要求派美国军队到约旦去。
    消息说，另一方面侯赛因向英国司令部说，驻在约旦的英军不够，请求派新的增援部队。据报纸说，侯赛因抱怨约旦的军队中存在着强烈的动摇情绪，因此他不能依靠他的军队。
    “消息报”写道，英国政府决定急速向约旦派遣新的英国军队。这些军队已经到达了亚喀巴港。这些军队是从亚丁和东非的英国殖民地通过海上运来的。英国军队从亚喀巴港用飞机运到安曼。同时还继续从塞浦路斯经过以色列领空从空中向安曼运送英国军队。
    新华社开罗9日电　中东通讯社记者8日从贝鲁特发出的一条消息说，各种迹象表明，美国侵略军准备盘踞黎巴嫩。
    这家通讯社的记者说，在贝鲁特附近的阿努德和瓦迪沙赫鲁尔地区，美国占领军正在建筑从他们的兵营通往大道的公路。美国侵略军总部已经在贝鲁特的马哈拉特区租了几座大楼，供各个司令部使用。有一位人士说，有一座大楼的租用合同的期限为五年。
    美国占领军当局还同当地的商人签订了合同，要他们供应建筑兵营用的材料。
    另一位人士说，美国驻黎巴嫩的空军司令部打算修建两个飞机场，一个在贝鲁特以南，另一个在贝鲁特西北的卡斯尔万。
    新华社贝鲁特9日电　侵黎美军总部8日宣布，决定从9日起每天允许约两千名美国侵略军官兵进入贝鲁特市区“自由消遣”。
    据侵黎美军总部划定的“消遣”地区，美国侵略军将占据贝鲁特最好的海滩，最好的旅馆、餐馆、酒吧间和夜总会胡作非为。在这以前，美国通讯社承认，美国侵略军在贝鲁特的主要“消遣”就是去妓院发泄兽性，蹂躏黎巴嫩妇女。
    据贝鲁特“明星日报”报道，美国侵略军自知受到黎巴嫩人民的普遍痛恨，因而处在草木皆兵的紧张状态，这次在允许侵略军官兵去“消遣”的同时，还特别派遣军医人员去检验黎巴嫩旅馆和餐馆中的食物和饮料，检查这些地方的厨房用具等，以防中毒。
