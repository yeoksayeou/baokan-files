　　Ode to the Xushui People's Commune
　　IV. Morning Dew and Evening Fragrance
　　Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Kang Zhuo
　　After Chairman Mao inspected Xushui, I, unable to contain my excitement, wrote several ill-formed old-style poems to record that extraordinary event. Two lines, describing the Chairman's concern and inspection of the lives of children and the elderly, went like this:
　　　"In nurseries, they praise the morning dew,
　　　In happiness gardens, they send forth evening fragrance."
　　The verses are not worth mentioning at all. However, when I want to write about the children and elderly in the people's commune here, I still feel that only the terms "morning dew" and "evening fragrance" are most appropriate.
　　Nurseries, kindergartens, and "happiness gardens" where the elderly are cared for are all flowers in the people's commune here. These institutions began to appear even before the people's commune was established. These institutions, like the militarization and communal dining in rural Xushui, were precursors to the establishment of the people's commune. However, the establishment of the people's commune has made these flowers bloom even more fragrantly and beautifully.

　　Blooming Flowers
　　Please take a look at the kindergarten in Xie Fang Village of the Suicheng People's Commune! One hundred and seventy-three children aged three to seven occupy a separate two-courtyard, high-ceilinged, whitewashed building. Most of them live in the kindergarten, with fifteen children sleeping on one kang (a heated brick bed). The boys all wear blue shorts and white vests with red characters, and the girls all wear white dresses with colorful flowers. Each child has a washbasin and a square towel with a number on it. They eat four tons of food a day, and lunch is either pancakes, pickles, and egg drop soup, or rice and stir-fried eggplant. There are more than two hundred toys: cloth dolls, doves of peace, teddy bears, chicks, frogs, cicadas, cars, harmonicas, small drums, wooden knives, and balls. No one can count how many kinds there are. The village also has a children's park in a grove of trees at the south end of the village. The grove is shaded by green leaves; occasionally, there are sparse branches that weave the sunlight into patterns, like a carpet, spread on the very clean sandy ground. The children play ball, play house, and create their own fairy tales on the patterned sandy carpet. Then, the caregivers lead them to the fields to weed, to learn about labor. Then they take them back. After the children return, they play games, draw pictures, and the older children even learn to read. The most common lesson is singing.
　　These children really do regard the kindergarten as their home. They don't miss home, and even if they get sick, the village has doctors and clinics that give them priority treatment. They also have routine physical examinations. They are all so pretty and clean. When they sing, each has their own expression and personality. They are truly growing vigorously in freedom, and anyone who comes to the kindergarten cannot help but fall in love with them at first sight. The children in the kindergarten are also very happy and lively when they see any guests. They shake hands with the guests, call them uncles and aunts, and when the guests are about to leave, they shake hands again and again to say goodbye, and even see them off to the outer courtyard. Children living in the people's commune that is marching towards communism are indeed as bright and shining as dewdrops in the morning; all kind-hearted people throughout history who have dreamed of a people's paradise life would surely be so happy that tears like dewdrops would well up in their eyes if they came here to see it.
　　In Xushui, it is not only the kindergarten in Xie Fang that is well-run. Da Si Ge Zhuang, where Chairman Mao visited, and many other villages have also arranged for their children to be like dewdrops on red flowers and green leaves. The county has three hundred and eighty-six kindergartens and one thousand nine hundred and eighteen nurseries, with a total of forty-eight thousand three hundred and twenty-five children. Except for a few nurseries that are not very standardized, the rest are like blooming flowers, constantly improving and guiding the few that are not very standardized to catch up quickly.
　　Here, we must mention the kindergarten caregivers; they are one of the decisive forces in running the kindergarten well. The caregivers in the county are all young girls and daughters-in-law, mostly with a higher elementary education, politically active, and with some hygiene knowledge. Caregivers also take turns to receive training in the county, learning political and childcare knowledge, learning children's songs, dances, and games, and even learning a little child psychology; their direction is to be both red and expert.
　　Of course, one of the fundamental forces in running the kindergarten well is the people's commune and all the members' greatest love and care for their own descendants. In most nurseries and kindergartens in Xushui, the expenses for food, supplies, and even some clothing are all covered by the commune in a unified manner. This is the decision of the members themselves. Someone asked:
　　"Is it okay to do this? Isn't this making those without children or with fewer children suffer?"
　　"What suffering or taking advantage!" When the members of the commune debated this issue, they said: "When those without children or with fewer children get old and have no one to support them, won't they be able to enter the Happiness Homes first? If you want to calculate carefully, at that time, those with children and support will not be able to enter the Happiness Homes, and you might say that they are suffering again?"
　　Some people also said that since the commune mainly bears the children's expenses, it will encourage everyone to have more children. The members, however, said that today's young people are trying to postpone their marriage age as much as possible, and those who are married understand the benefits of contraception and family planning, so where will those problems occur! They also said that now we are engaged in the people's commune, marching towards communism; if there is no communist thought and style for the descendants who will build communism, then what is the point of calling it a people's commune!

　　Happy Old Age
　　The Happiness Homes that support the elderly who have lost their ability to work also implement a firm class line. Here, let's write about the Happiness Home in Xie Fang Village. There are eight old men and four old women in the home, all elderly people in their seventies and eighties and poor people with no one to rely on. There are paintings everywhere on the inner and outer walls of their courtyard, and ten pots of flowers are planted inside and outside the courtyard. Three old women cook their own meals. In the morning and evening, they have noodles, thick porridge, and dry food; at noon, they have pancakes or steamed buns, and there is always one dish and one soup. The Wang Shichang and Zhu Lao Cui couples both live in the Happiness Home, each couple occupying a single room, each room having electric lights and brand-new teapots and teacups. Wang Shichang is eighty-two years old, literate, and has the "Xushui Daily" on his kang; but his hearing is not very good.
　　Zhang Lao Xiao, eighty-two years old, drove a cart for the landlords all his life. Now he has nothing and has been tortured so that his legs are swollen and shiny. He now lives in the Happiness Home, and he cannot help but have tears in his eyes when he sees people. Grandpa Wu Lao Zhi always explains to the guests:
　　"He is happy! If it weren't for this communist era, not to mention white flour and eggs every day, he wouldn't even be able to beg for food at the door!
　　There are many old men like Zhang Lao Xiao in this county. The county has one hundred and seventeen Happiness Homes, supporting two thousand seven hundred and three elderly people. When they see visitors, they will want to stand up with their crutches, lead the guests to visit their entire lives, and tell people countless bittersweet stories, and even shed tears while speaking, just like Mao Zedong's poem describes: "Suddenly, it is reported that a tiger has been subdued in the human world, and tears fly down like a torrential rain." The "subdued tiger" here, of course, refers to the inevitable fate of the final total collapse that has begun for all old lives for thousands of years.
　　However, the elderly in Xushui are not content to enjoy happiness. After Chairman Mao inspected Da Si Ge Zhuang, several old men left the Happiness Home to participate in labor; all those living in the Happiness Home also want to go out to manage the vegetable garden, act as agricultural advisors, and those with mobility difficulties must at least pick vegetables for the cafeteria. Only in this way can they feel comfortable and feel the true evening fragrance. No one can stop them from participating in labor. The red-letter verse at the entrance of the Xie Fang Happiness Home reads:
　　"The tiger is old but the ambition remains, the person is old but the heart is not old.
　　If the sea is filled, the sea can be leveled, if the mountain is moved, the mountain can be toppled.
　　If anyone is not convinced, we will have a race.
　　Why is the enthusiasm so high? The Party's leadership is good."
　　The ambition here is an important part of the happiness and evening fragrance of the elderly. If the children in the kindergarten today, like morning dew, are the first generation of descendants in our country to build communism, then the figures of evening fragrance in the Happiness Home are the first generation of elderly people in our country to see communism. The members of the Xushui People's Commune, like they treat the kindergarten, are also proud to boast about these elderly people: "This is our communism!" The ambition and happiness of these elderly people are also constantly driving the people of Xushui to stride towards communism like flying. (End of this section, full text not finished)

　　徐水人民公社颂
　　四、朝露和晚香
　　本报特约记者　康濯
    在毛主席视察徐水以后，我由于抑制不住的兴奋，曾经写了几首不成形的旧体诗，记载当时那极不平常的事件。其中写到主席关怀和视察这里儿童与老人生活情景的两句是这样：
    托儿所里夸朝露，
    幸福园中送晚香。
    诗句根本值不得一提。不过，我要写写这里人民公社的儿童和老人，却依然感到只有用朝露和晚香来形容才最为恰当。
    托儿所，幼儿园，老人们养老的幸福院，都是这儿人民公社里的鲜花。这些机构还在人民公社建成以前就开始出现，这些机构和徐水农村的军事化、食堂化等一样，都是建立人民公社的先声；但人民公社的建成，又使得这些鲜花开得更香更美。
    盛放的鲜花
    请看看遂城人民公社里谢坊村的幼儿园吧！一百七十三个三周岁到七周岁的小孩，单独占了一座前后两进的粉白高房大院。大都在园内住宿，一条炕上睡十五个，男孩一律是蓝短裤和白地红字的背心，女孩一律是白地彩花的连衣裙。一人一个洗脸盆，一块写了号码的方毛巾。每天四吨饭，中午不是烙饼、咸菜和鸡蛋汤，就是大米饭和炒茄子。玩具有二百多件，布娃娃、和平鸽、小熊、小鸡、青蛙、蝉、汽车、口琴、小鼓、木刀和皮球，谁也数不清有多少种类。村里还有个幼儿公园，在村南头的一个树林子里，树林绿叶成荫；间或也有枝干稀疏之处，把太阳光织成花纹，像地毯一样铺在十分干净的沙土地上。小孩们便在花纹的沙土地毯上拍皮球，过家家，创造各自的童话世界。然后，教养员领他们去地里拔草，去学习劳动。然后就领他们回去。小孩们回去以后，就作游戏，画画，大孩子还识字。最多的课程是学唱歌。
    这些小孩的确都把幼儿园当作家，他们也不想家，即使有了病，村里也有医生和卫生所给优先诊治。日常都还要检查身体。他们都是那样漂亮和清洁。唱歌的时候，各有各的表情和性格。他们真是自由自在地茂盛生长，任何人到了幼儿园里都不能不一见倾心。幼儿园的小孩们见了任何客人，也是高兴的活蹦乱跳。同客人握手，叫叔叔阿姨，客人们要走了，又纷纷握手再见，并且要送到外院。生活在向共产主义迈进的人民公社里的儿童，实在都如早晨的露珠那样发亮闪光；古往今来一切理想着人民的天堂生活的好心人物，要到这儿看看，都准会欢愉得眼里冒出露珠般的泪水。
    在徐水，并不是只有谢坊的幼儿园办得好。毛主席到过的大寺各庄和其它许多村子，都同样把儿童们安排成了红花绿叶上的朝露珠儿。全县三百八十六个幼儿园和一千九百一十八个托儿所，共有小孩四万八千三百二十五名；除了少数托儿所还不很正规，其余的都像盛放的鲜花，都在不断提高，在引导少数不很正规的托儿所快步赶上。
    这里必须提起幼儿园的教养员同志，她们是办好幼儿园的决定力量之一。全县的教养员一律都是年轻的姑娘、媳妇，大多是高小程度，政治积极，有一定的卫生知识。教养员还轮流上县里受训，学政治和保育知识，学儿童歌、舞和游戏，甚至还学点儿童心理学；她们的方向是又红又专。
    当然，幼儿园办得好的根本力量之一，还是由于人民公社和全体社员对于自己后代的最大的爱护和关怀。徐水大多数托儿所和幼儿园的吃、用乃至部分衣服的花销，都由公社统一包干。这是社员们自己的决定。有人问道：
    “这么办行吗？这不是没儿女的和儿女少的要吃亏吗？”
    “什么吃亏占便宜啊！”公社社员们辩论这个问题时说：“没儿女的和儿女少的，等他们老了，没人供养的时候，他们不是能够优先进幸福院么？要算细账的话，到那时候，有儿有女有供养的进不了幸福院，你可能说又是他们吃亏了么？”
    还有人说，小孩们的吃用主要都由公社负担，会鼓励大家多生子女。社员们却说，如今的青年都在尽量推迟结婚的年岁，结了婚又懂得节育和计划生育的好处的，哪里还会发生那些问题！又说，现在是搞人民公社，是向共产主义迈进；对于建设共产主义的后代，若没有点儿共产主义思想和风格，那还叫什么人民公社哩！
    幸福的晚年
    供养失掉劳力的老人们的幸福院，也同样执行着坚定的阶级路线。这里还是写写谢坊村的幸福院。院内有八位老大爷和四位老大娘，都是七八十岁的老人和没依没靠的穷人。他们院子里的内外院墙上到处都是画幅，院子里外种着十盆花。三位老大娘自己做饭，早晚是面条、稠粥和干粮，中午是烙饼或包子，并且总有一菜一汤。王世昌老两口和朱老翠老两口都同住幸福院，他们每一对各占一个单间，每间房里都有电灯，有崭新的茶壶茶碗。王世昌八十二岁，识字，炕上摆着“徐水报”；但他耳朵不大好。
    八十二岁的张老孝，给地主赶了一辈子车，如今要甚没甚，还给折磨得腿脚肿的发亮。他现在住在幸福院里，见了人就忍不住眼泪汪汪；吴老芝大爷总是给客人解释道：
    “他这是高兴的呀！要不是这共产主义的年头，不用说天天白面鸡蛋的，他连要饭吃都会赶不上门口呢！
    这个县里像张老孝这样的老汉还多得很。全县有一百一十七个幸福院，供养着两千七百零三个老人。他们见了参观者，都会要拄着拐杖站起来，领着客人参观他们的全部生活，并且向人说着数不尽的苦辣酸甜，甚至还会一边说一边泪水直流，就像毛主席的诗句描写的那样：“忽报人间曾伏虎，泪飞顿作倾盆雨。”这里的“伏虎”，指的当然是千万年来的一切旧的生活，都已经开始了最后总崩溃的必然的命运。
    不过，徐水的老人都并不安于坐享幸福。毛主席视察大寺各庄以后，那儿就有几个老汉离开了幸福院而去参加劳动；所有住在幸福院的，也都要出去管管菜园，当当农事顾问，行动困难的至少也要给食堂捡捡菜。他们只有这样才心情舒畅，才感到真正的晚香。他们是谁也不能阻挡地非要参加劳动。谢坊幸福院门口的红字诗句写道：
    虎老雄心在，人老心不老。
    填海海能平，搬山山能倒。
    谁要不服气，咱就赛赛跑。
    为啥干劲足，党的领导好。
    这儿的雄心，正是老人们幸福和晚香的一个重要部分。如果说，今天幼儿园里朝露般的儿童，是我国建设共产主义的第一辈后代的话；那末，幸福院里晚香的人物就是我国第一辈看到共产主义的老人。徐水人民公社的社员也都和对待幼儿园一样，为这些老人而自豪地夸说着：“这就是咱们的共产主义！”这些老人的雄心和幸福，更在时时推动着徐水人民迈向共产主义的步伐如飞。　　（本段完，全文未完）
