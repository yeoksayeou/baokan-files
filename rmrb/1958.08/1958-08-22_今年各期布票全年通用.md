　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: This year's cloth coupons can be used throughout the year.

　　The State Council recently approved the report from the First and Second Commercial Ministries regarding the year-round validity of this year's cloth coupons. The report specifically stipulates that cloth coupons issued last year, from September 1957 to the end of August 1958, can continue to be used until the end of 1958. Cloth coupons issued this year, from September to December 1958, can be used in advance. As for the cloth coupons issued this year from March to December 1958, the original usage period remains unchanged.

　　The report stated that this year's cloth coupons are divided into three periods, from September of last year to the end of this year, due to the change in the annual term. Using them in installments makes the cloth coupons relatively scattered, causing inconvenience for residents and making it easy to have leftover coupons insufficient for a single piece of clothing material. Especially considering the needs and convenience of the broad masses of farmers to buy cotton cloth after the unprecedented bumper harvest this year, it has been decided that this year's cloth coupons will be valid throughout the year.

　　今年各期布票全年通用
    新华社21日讯  今年各期布票可以全年通用。
    国务院最近批准了第一、第二商业部关于今年布票全年通用问题的报告。报告具体规定：去年发放的自1957年9月到1958年8月底的布票，可以继续有效使用到1958年年底；今年发放的自1958年9月到12月的布票，可以提前使用；至于今年发放的自1958年3月到12月的布票，仍按原规定使用期限不变。
    报告说，今年的购布票由于改变年度期限的关系，从去年9月到今年年底共有三期，由于分期使用，布票比较零星，居民使用不便，而且容易发生余票不足一件衣料而不好使用的问题，尤其是考虑到今年农业空前大丰收以后，广大农民群众秋后购买棉布的需要和便利，因此决定今年各期布票全年通用。
