Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 8th. The Lebanese National Front issued a statement on August 8th protesting Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik's representation of Lebanon at the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session discussing the Middle East situation. The statement said, "Lebanon will not be bound by any actions taken by Malik in the United Nations General Assembly."

The statement pointed out that Malik only represents the outgoing Chamoun regime, and that Chamoun and Malik "invited" the American invading forces to Lebanon. The statement said that the National Front will not recognize any delegation sent to the United Nations that is subservient to Chamoun.

The National Front issued another statement protesting the nomination of Malik as President of the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly. The National Front distributed this statement to the member states of the United Nations, requesting that these countries not support Malik.

The National Front also said in this statement that if Malik is elected, he will use his position "to continue destructive activities that violate the interests of Lebanon and the interests of Lebanon's Arab neighbors."

    黎巴嫩民族阵线声明
    抗议马利克出席联大会议
    新华社贝鲁特8日电　黎巴嫩民族阵线在8日发表声明，抗议黎巴嫩外交部长马利克代表黎巴嫩出席讨论中东局势的联合国大会紧急特别会议。声明说，“黎巴嫩将不受马利克在联合国大会中采取的任何行动的约束。”
    声明指出，马利克只代表即将下台的夏蒙的政权。而夏蒙和马利克“邀请”了美国侵略军到黎巴嫩来。声明说，民族阵线将不承认听命于夏蒙的派到联合国的任何代表团。
    民族阵线发表了另一声明，抗议提名马利克为联合国大会第十三届会议的主席。民族阵线把这项声明分发给联合国会员国，要求这些国家不要支持马利克。
    民族阵线在这项声明中还说，如果马利克当选，他就会利用他的地位“继续进行违反黎巴嫩利益和违反黎巴嫩的阿拉伯各邻邦的利益的破坏性活动”。
