　　Using Corn Stalks to Make Sugar and Wine
　　Qujing County Research Proves Economic Value More Than Three Times That of Corn
　　This newspaper reported from Kunming on the 28th: Qujing County in Yunnan Province has pioneered a path for the comprehensive utilization of corn. Experiments have shown that corn stalks can be used to extract sugar, wine, and rayon, while corn cobs can be used to brew wine, make vinegar, and feed pigs. The entire county is now vigorously promoting this.
　　Corn is the main crop in the mountainous areas of Qujing, with more than 360,000 mu planted this year. In the past, after harvesting the corn, farmers used only a portion of the tender corn stalks to feed pigs, discarding the rest. Corn cobs were also not utilized. This year, in order to increase the income of farmers in mountainous areas and expand the sources of industrial raw materials, the Qujing County Committee decided to comprehensively utilize all the resources of the corn plant. According to the instructions of the County Committee, employees of the County Second Commercial Bureau conducted experiments in August at processing plants in Xiaohousuo, Chengguan Town, and Tanjia Ying to extract sugar and brew wine from corn stalks. First, the corn stalks were cut short, and juice containing 15% sugar was extracted. The sugar juice was then boiled into maltose. This sugar is sweet, much like honey, and can be used not only for consumption but also to cultivate yeast and as a starter for wine mash. The crushed corn stalks, after the sugar has been extracted, are mixed with 2% wine yeast, and after saccharification and sealed fermentation, white wine with a concentration of 53 degrees is brewed. This white wine can also be made into alcohol. The remaining corn stalk residue after brewing contains a lot of fiber and can be used to process rayon.
　　The Baijiu (white wine) factory under the Second Commercial Bureau also successfully experimented with using corn cobs to brew wine and make vinegar. They crushed the corn cobs into powder, steamed them, mixed them with 2% wine yeast, and after saccharification, mash, and fermentation, brewed white wine. The remaining wine tails were added with a certain amount of salt and placed in jars, which after three months to half a year, became sour vinegar. The final remaining residue can be used to feed pigs.
　　Multiple experiments have shown that 100 jin of corn stalks can produce at least 4 jin of wine, and up to more than 13 jin. Under normal operating conditions, 10 jin of wine can generally be guaranteed, and 4 jin of sugar can also be produced. One hundred jin of corn cobs can produce 8 jin of wine and 20 jin of vinegar. It is estimated that this year an average of at least 1,000 jin of corn stalks and 100 jin of corn cobs can be harvested per mu of corn land, which can produce 108 jin of wine, 40 jin of sugar, and 20 jin of vinegar, as well as rayon. The value of these products has exceeded the value of the corn itself produced per mu.
　　Currently, the entire county is actively preparing for the comprehensive utilization of corn. In late August, the Second Commercial Bureau opened a short-term wine-making training class to train more than 100 technicians who mastered wine-making techniques for various agricultural cooperatives. After on-site visits and continuous research, they summarized the method of brewing wine with earthen stoves and wooden steamers. The equipment is simple, the cost is low, and the operation is easy, so each agricultural cooperative and each production team can produce their own wine. Currently, 371 earthen stoves have been built throughout the county, and it is expected that 1,500 stoves will be built by the end of August, reaching one stove per production team. A kind of earthen machine for extracting sugar from corn stalks has been successfully researched and can extract 7,000 jin to 8,000 jin of corn stalks per day. Rayon processing factories are also being established one after another in various townships and cooperatives. The Qujing County Committee has made a plan to comprehensively utilize at least half of the corn planting area this year. In wine-making alone, 18 million jin of white wine can be produced this year, which is worth 5.4 million yuan at local prices. The 360,000 people in the county can increase their income by an average of 15 yuan per person. (Huang Changlu) (Attached picture)

### 利用玉米秆制糖造酒  曲靖县研究证明：经济价值超过玉米三倍

　　利用玉米秆制糖造酒
    曲靖县研究证明：经济价值超过玉米三倍
    本报昆明28日电　云南省曲靖县开辟了综合利用玉米的道路。试验证明，玉米秆可以提取糖、酒和人造棉，玉米芯可以酿酒、制醋和喂猪，现在全县正在大力推广。
    玉米是曲靖山区的主要农作物，全县今年种植了三十六万多亩。往年收了玉米以后，农民除用一部分嫩玉米秆喂猪以外，其它都任其弃置，玉米芯也不加利用。今年，曲靖县委为了增加山区农民的收入，扩大工业原料的泉源，决定综合利用玉米全身的资源。县第二商业局的职工根据县委指示，8月份在小后所、城关镇、潭家营等地加工厂进行了用玉米秆榨糖、烤酒的试验。先把玉米秆截短，榨出了含糖15％的汁，利用糖汁熬成了饴糖。这种糖味甜，很像蜂蜜，除食用外，还可用来培养酵母和作酒母醪等。利用榨过糖的玉米秆破碎，拌入2％的酒药，经过糖化和密封发酵等过程，酿出了浓度达五十三度的白酒，这种白酒还可以制成酒精。酿酒剩下的玉米秆渣，含的纤维还很多，可以用来加工成人造棉。
    第二商业局所属白酒厂试验用玉米芯酿酒、制醋也很成功。他们将玉米芯破碎成粉末状，蒸熟以后，拌入2％的酒药，经过糖化、酒糟、发酵，酿成了白酒。剩下的酒尾，加入一定的食盐，装入坛内，经过三个月至半年便成为酸醋。最后剩下的渣，可用来喂猪。
    多次试验结果，一百斤玉米秆最少可出四斤酒，最多出到十三斤多，在操作正常的情况下，一般可保证出酒十斤，还可出四斤糖。一百斤玉米芯可出八斤酒和二十斤醋。预计今年平均每亩玉米地至少可收一千斤玉米秆和一百斤玉米芯，可以生产一百零八斤酒，四十斤糖和二十斤醋，还有人造棉。这些产品的价值已经超过了一亩地所产玉米本身的价值。
    目前，全县正在积极进行综合利用玉米的各种准备工作。第二商业局在8月下旬开办了短期的酿酒训练班，为各农业社培养了一百多名掌握酿酒的技术人员，他们经过现场参观操作和不断钻研，总结出了用土灶、木甑酿酒的方法。设备简单、成本低廉、操作容易，每个农业社、每个生产队都可自行生产。现全县已建立土灶三百七十一座，预计到8月底可建成一千五百座，达到每个生产队有灶。一种用玉米秆榨糖的土机器已研究成功，每天可榨七千斤至八千斤玉米秆；人造棉加工厂也在各乡、社纷纷建立起来。曲靖县委已作出规划，今年至少要把种植面积一半的玉米加以综合利用，仅酿酒一项，今年可生产白酒一千八百万斤，按当地价格计算，值五百四十万元，全县三十六万人口，平均每人可增加十五元的收入。　（黄昌禄）（附图片）
