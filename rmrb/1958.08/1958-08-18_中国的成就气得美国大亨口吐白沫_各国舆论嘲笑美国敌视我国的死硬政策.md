Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The U.S. State Department's memorandum, which demonstrates Washington's insistence on a die-hard policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, has been vehemently criticized by world opinion.

The Bulgarian newspaper "Agricultural Banner" stated in an article on the 14th that recently many countries have demanded the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and such calls can also be heard in the United States. The article emphasized that the policy of ignoring the People's China is unwise. Regardless of whether certain governments recognize it or not, this great country still exists. The Chinese people, united around the well-tested Chinese Communist Party and government, are advancing by leaps and bounds, and neither ridiculous memorandums nor "non-recognition" policies can stop the Chinese people from advancing towards socialist victory.

Romania's "Free Romania" newspaper pointed out in an article on the 13th, why did the United States reiterate its policy towards the People's Republic of China, a major Asian power, in the memorandum? This is because China has made great achievements both domestically and internationally, and its international prestige has greatly increased. These astonishing achievements have enraged the American monopoly capitalists to the point of foaming at the mouth. These people originally fantasized that the regime established according to the will of the Chinese people would collapse, the industrialization plan would fail, and China would once again become a colony of imperialism. However, contrary to their wishes, China is becoming an industrial power. The article concluded: There is no doubt that no matter what conspiracies and tricks American imperialism resorts to, they will be futile. China will continue to achieve new successes in internal affairs and diplomacy.

The U.S. government's policy of persisting in being hostile to the Chinese people has also aroused increasingly profound dissatisfaction among Western bourgeois figures.

The American "Nation" magazine ridiculed the U.S. government's policy in an editorial on August 16 as "the optical principle proposed by Washington that makes a country with 600 million people become an (invisible) invisible man." The "Nation" magazine wrote, "One day, and there will definitely be such a day, Washington will realize that without China's participation, no international political conference can lead to beneficial results." The American "Carlston Report" believes that American diplomats "are playing the ostrich trick of burying their heads in the sand" in dealing with China. The newspaper said, "We make ourselves more ridiculous in the eyes of our allies and neutral countries."

In Britain, newspapers from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party have issued calls for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and not to allow the Chiang Kai-shek clique to continue to usurp them. The British Labour Party's "Daily Herald" said on the 12th that it is clear that it is impossible to solve world problems without China's participation. The newspaper said that the world cannot begin to build peace because of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' die-hard attitude towards China. The conservative British "Observer" said: "The United States and its stubborn allies have been trying to jointly ignore (China's growing influence on the international stage) for nearly ten years. It is time to end this fruitless policy." The Cooperative Party's "Reynold News" also said that the Chinese government can no longer be treated as if it does not exist. The argument that Chiang Kai-shek represents China in the United Nations is not only ridiculous, but also increasingly a threat to peace.

In France, the influential "Le Monde" ridiculed the United States, saying that the United States is worried that China's entry into the United Nations will further enhance its prestige, but in fact, China's rapid economic development and strengthening of its power will also enhance its prestige. "Echoes" and "Battle" believe that the West cannot ignore the strength of People's China.

### 中国的成就气得美国大亨口吐白沫　各国舆论嘲笑美国敌视我国的死硬政策

　　中国的成就气得美国大亨口吐白沫
　　各国舆论嘲笑美国敌视我国的死硬政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国国务院发表的表明华盛顿坚持敌视中国人民的死硬政策的备忘录，受到各国舆论的猛烈抨击。
    保加利亚“农业旗帜报”14日的文章说，最近以来很多国家都要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，在美国也可以听到这种呼声。文章强调说，无视人民中国的政策是不明智的。不管某些政府承认与否，这个伟大的国家仍然存在。团结在久经锻炼的中国共产党和政府周围的中国人民正在大踏步地前进，无论是可笑的备忘录，或者是“不承认的”政策，都不能阻挡中国人民向社会主义胜利前进。
    罗马尼亚的“自由罗马尼亚报”13日的文章指出，美国为什么要在备忘录中重申它对中华人民共和国这个亚洲大国的政策呢？这是因为中国在国内外都取得了很大成就，它在国际上的威信大大提高了。这些惊人的成就气得美国垄断资本家口吐白沫。这些人原来曾幻想：根据中国人民群众的意志建立起来的政权将会垮台，工业化的计划将会失败，中国将重新变为帝国主义的殖民地。但是，和他们的愿望恰恰相反，中国正在变为一个工业大国。文章最后说：毫无疑问，美国帝国主义不管施展什么阴谋诡计，都是徒劳无用的，中国在内政、外交上将继续取得新的成就。
    美国政府坚持与中国人民为敌的政策，在西方资产阶级人士中也引起越来越深刻的不满。
    美国“民族”周刊8月16日在社论中讥笑美国政府的这种政策是“华盛顿所提出的使得一个拥有六亿人口的国家变成（看不见的）隐身人的光学原理”。“民族”周刊写道，“终有一天，而且一定会有这样一天，华盛顿将会认识到，没有中国参加，任何国际政治会议都不能导致有益的结果。”美国“卡尔斯登报”认为，美国的外交官在同中国打交道方面“玩弄了鸵鸟把头埋在沙子里的伎俩”。这家报纸说，“我们使自己在盟国和中立国的眼中变得更加可笑了”。
    在英国，从保守党到工党的报纸，都发出了呼声，认为必须恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利，而不能让蒋介石集团继续窃据。英国工党的“每日先驱报”12日说，事情很清楚，没有中国的参与，要解决世界问题是不可能的。这家报纸说，由于美国国务卿杜勒斯对中国的死硬态度，世界就无法着手缔造和平。保守的英国“观察家报”说：“美国和它的固执的盟国企图共同无视（中国在国际舞台上影响日益增长）这个事实，已经快十年。目前是结束这种毫无结果的政策的时候了。”合作党的“雷诺新闻”也说，对待中国政府再也不能像以往那样，好像它并不存在似的。蒋介石在联合国内代表中国这种论调已经不只是令人耻笑，而且越来越成为对和平的威胁。
    在法国，有影响的“世界报”讥笑美国说，美国担心中国进入联合国会进一步提高它的威望，其实中国经济的飞跃发展和力量的加强也一样会提高它的威望。“回声报”和“战斗报”认为，西方不能忽视人民中国的强大。
