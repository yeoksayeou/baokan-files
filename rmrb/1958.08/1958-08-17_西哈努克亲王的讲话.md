Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The full text of Prince Norodom Sihanouk's speech at the state banquet held by Premier Zhou Enlai is as follows:

    It has been more than three years since I first met Premier Zhou Enlai and the delegation of People's China attending the Bandung Conference in April 1955. Over the years, I have become increasingly convinced that that day in April marked one of the major political events in modern Cambodia. Allow me also to recall my visit to Beijing in 1956, during which I was deeply impressed by the understanding and sincerity of the Chinese politicians towards our country and the policy of strict neutrality we pursue.

    Finally, I would like to mention Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Cambodia at the end of 1956. This friendly visit, the first contact between the Chinese Premier and the Cambodian people, left an unforgettable impression on our country. Everyone felt that China was very kind to us, treated us with brotherly friendship, respected our social system and customs, and cared about helping us embark on the road to progress.

    We have not forgotten Premier Zhou Enlai's speech to the vast number of overseas Chinese residing in Cambodia, in which he asked all compatriots residing in our country not to participate in any political activities that would hinder our government, to respect our laws and customs, and to work only to make effective contributions to our country's economic development. This speech and these suggestions fully embody China's respect for us, a respect that earns China honor and allows us to maintain neutrality, otherwise we would soon be threatened by others and accused of favoring one political system against another, and of becoming a base for aggression against other countries. In short, without China's respect for us, we would be accused by others of constituting a common international danger.

    Since Premier Zhou Enlai's visit, exchanges between our two countries have become increasingly frequent. First, there were visits by our cultural delegation and the Royal Ballet Troupe, followed by visits by our Buddhist leaders, journalists, and parliamentary delegations. The achievements of the highly skilled Chinese Peking Opera Troupe in Cambodia last November are still talked about today. These exchanges of mutual trust and friendship have allowed our relationship to reach a level that transcends considerations of gain and loss.

    Another manifestation of the brotherly relations and complete coordination between our two countries is the generous and unconditional assistance your country has given us, which helps to develop our economy and thereby consolidate our independence. The initial results of this assistance are now apparent in the countryside, leading to a noticeable improvement in the living standards of our farmers. Soon, four newly built factories will become the initial core of our national industry within our capabilities. We are determined to use this assistance to increase production, industrialization, and social and administrative undertakings: these goals will be achieved as scheduled. I can assure you that the Cambodian people will never forget this effort made by your great country. I would like to express my gratitude to you once again in person.

    The recent establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Cambodia and China is a very natural confirmation of the fact that our two countries share friendship and a common desire to consolidate peace on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The establishment of diplomatic relations is also a natural result of the exchanges between our two countries, which were promoted by Premier Zhou Enlai.

    Finally, on behalf of the Cambodian government and people, I would like to express my best wishes to the Chinese government and people, wishing the Chinese people complete success in peaceful construction, building New China into a powerful country, and contributing its wisdom to safeguarding peace and promoting the prosperity of all countries in the world.

    Long live the eternal friendship between Cambodia and China!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

    Long live Premier Zhou Enlai and the government of the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the Chinese people!

　　西哈努克亲王的讲话
    新华社16日讯　诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下在周恩来总理举行的国宴上的讲话，全文如下：
    自从1955年4月的一天，我第一次会见周恩来总理先生和出席万隆会议的人民中国的代表团以来，已经有三年多了。几年来，使我日益深信，4月的那一天标志着现代柬埔寨重大的政治事件之一。请允许我也回顾一下1956年我在北京的访问，在那次访问期间，中国政治家们对于我国和我国所遵行的严格中立的政策的谅解和真诚态度，给了我深刻的印象。
    最后，我要提到1956年年底周恩来总理先生对柬埔寨的访问。这次友好访问，这次中国总理和柬埔寨人民的第一次接触，在我国留下了难忘的印象。每个人都感到中国对我们很亲切，以兄弟般的友谊对待我们，尊重我们的社会制度和风俗习惯，关心帮助我们走上进步的道路。
    我们没有忘记周恩来总理先生向侨居在柬埔寨的广大华侨的讲话，他在讲话中要求所有居住在我国的同胞们不参加足以妨碍我国政府的任何政治活动，尊重我国的法律和习惯，并且只为对我国的经济发展作出有效贡献而工作。这次讲话和这些建议充分体现了中国对我们的尊重，这种尊重使中国获得荣誉，并且使我们可以保持中立，否则我们很快就会受到别人的威胁并且被别人指责为偏袒一种政治制度来反对另一种政治制度，和成为侵略别国的基地。总之，如果没有中国对我们的尊重，我们就会被别人指责为构成了国际上的共同的危险。
    自从周恩来总理访问之后，我们两国之间的来往日益频繁了。首先有我国文化代表团和皇庭芭蕾舞团进行了访问，后来有我国佛教领袖和记者以及议会代表团的访问。去年11月艺术高超的中国京剧团在柬埔寨所获得的成就至今尚为人们所传颂。这些相互信任和友好的往来使得我们的关系已经达到超越利害计较的境地。
    我们两国间的兄弟关系和完全协调的另一个表现，就是贵国给予我们的慷慨而无条件的援助，这种援助有助于发展我们的经济，从而巩固我们的独立。这种援助的初步成效现在已经在农村中显露出来，使我国农民的生活水平得到了明显的改善。不久以后，四个新建的工厂将成为我们能力范围内的民族工业的初步核心。我们确定把这一援助用于增加生产、工业化、社会和行政事业：这些目的将如期完成。我可以向你们保证，柬埔寨人民永远也不会忘记你们伟大的国家所作的这一努力。我亲口再一次向你们表示感谢。
    最近柬埔寨和中国之间正常外交关系的建立，乃是对事实的很自然的确认，这个事实就是我们两国之间的友谊和它们为在和平共处五项原则的基础上巩固和平而努力的共同愿望。外交关系的建立也是我们两国之间的交往的自然结果，这种交往原是周恩来总理先生所促成的。
    最后，我谨代表柬埔寨政府和人民向中国政府和人民表示祝愿，祝中国人民在和平建设中取得美满的成就，把新中国建设成一个强国，用它的智慧对保卫和平和促进世界各国的繁荣作出贡献。
    中柬两国永恒的友谊万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    周恩来总理和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    中国人民万岁！
