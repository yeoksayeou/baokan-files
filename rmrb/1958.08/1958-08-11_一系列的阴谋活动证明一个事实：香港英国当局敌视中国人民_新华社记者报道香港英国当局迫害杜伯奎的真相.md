Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 10th. A serious incident in which the British authorities in Hong Kong unreasonably deported Du Bokui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, reflects that the British authorities in Hong Kong are using "politics should not interfere with schools" as a guise to systematically destroy the educational undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and are carrying out a political conspiracy against New China.

As early as the beginning of January this year, the British Legislative Council in Hong Kong passed the "1957 Education (Amendment) Ordinance." Using this ordinance, the British authorities in Hong Kong carried out a series of acts persecuting patriotic education undertakings and patriotic activities in Hong Kong. First, in early February this year, the Hong Kong British Education Department insisted that the Labor Children's School had "political activities" and announced the cessation of financial subsidies. On February 1, they sentenced two staff members of the literacy class run by the Qingshan Branch of the Planting Association on the absurd grounds of violating the "Education Ordinance," and at the same time unreasonably searched and interfered with other literacy classes. On May 1, the Hong Kong British authorities even more rudely interfered with nine schools, including Han Wah Middle School, hanging the Chinese national flag on holidays. On May 10, they prohibited New Qiao Middle School from hanging the Chinese national flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on the school anniversary. In addition, some patriotic schools have also been given troubles and persecutions by the British authorities in Hong Kong on issues such as school buildings and teacher registration. The incident in which the British authorities in Hong Kong unreasonably forced Du Bokui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, to leave Hong Kong is part of its plan to persecute patriotic education undertakings in Hong Kong.

These persecutions are concentrated on the issue of not allowing Chinese people to love China and interfering with and prohibiting Hong Kong schools from carrying out patriotic activities. Therefore, the so-called "politics should not interfere with schools" recently vigorously advocated by the Hong Kong British Education Department is just an excuse for them to infringe upon and deprive Hong Kong schools of their patriotic rights. Behind the guise of "politics should not interfere with schools," they hide an unspeakable political conspiracy against New China.

In the past six months, many university graduates who graduated in mainland China have been refused registration as teachers by the British Education Department in Hong Kong, and some who have already been registered have been revoked later. The two teachers hired by Pui Kiu Middle School who graduated from the Overseas Chinese Normal College were deregistered by the Hong Kong British Education Department after registration, and even when the school authorities applied to change the two university graduates to primary school teachers, they were absurdly considered "not qualified." Some officials in the Hong Kong British Education Department responsible for teacher registration have stated that he followed the instructions of his superiors and could only approve teacher registration for Chinese university graduates before 1949, while those after 1949 must undergo a "detailed review" by the Education Department.

This behavior of hostility towards New China is even more blatantly expressed in the list of approved Chinese textbooks for schools announced by the Hong Kong British Education Department on July 23 this year. According to this directory, Hong Kong schools are completely unable to use textbooks published in China, and many textbooks published in Hong Kong are also prohibited from being used, while textbooks published by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group and Hong Kong-based US-Chiang special agencies are used in large quantities. Especially in the two subjects of Chinese history and geography, all primary and secondary school textbooks are only allowed to use textbooks published by Taiwan and US-Chiang special agents in Hong Kong, and there can be no other choices. These textbooks are completely hostile to the People's Republic of China. Currently, the "social textbooks" taught in Hong Kong government schools refer to Beijing as the "old capital" of China, not the capital. The Education Department stipulates that the Chinese maps used by government primary schools even absurdly list the Mongolian People's Republic as a province of China, and the capital of China is said to be Nanjing instead of Beijing.

A letter from a well-known Hong Kong doctor published in the "South China Morning Post" on February 5 also revealed the following facts: Students in some Hong Kong government schools are afraid to go to theaters showing Chinese films to watch Chinese films because they have been warned; when the Chinese Folk Art Troupe performed in Hong Kong in 1956, teachers working in the Education Department were also obviously "advised" not to watch these performances.

But at the same time, in schools run by US-Chiang special agents, political activities against New China are carried out blatantly and rampantly. Although the British government has recognized the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong British Education Department allows schools run by US-Chiang special agents in Hong Kong to fly the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek Group every day. Chiang gang special agent "teachers" arbitrarily carry out political propaganda slandering China in their classes, and have never been interfered with. In the libraries of schools controlled by Chiang gang elements, there are many reactionary books, including Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" and so on. During the Hungarian incident, schools run by Chiang gang elements in Hong Kong openly distributed some political propaganda brochures against the People's Republic of China several times. Publications and films against the People's Republic of China published and filmed by the US Information Agency are also frequently distributed and shown in these US-Chiang schools. In some gatherings of the De Ming Middle School controlled by the Chiang gang elements in Hong Kong, reactionary slogans such as "counter-attack the mainland" were openly shouted. Even more rampant was that after the Kowloon riots, some special agent "teachers" from De Ming Middle School openly instructed students to hold memorial services to commemorate the US-Chiang special agents who died in the riots. The "Anti-Communist and Resist-Russian National Salvation Youth League," a special agent organization affiliated with Taiwan, is currently operating semi-openly in US-Chiang schools. All of this has not been interfered with or prohibited by the Hong Kong British Education Department. The British authorities in Hong Kong are openly sheltering and condoning these political activities against New China.

The above well-known facts illustrate the truth about the incident in which Du Bokui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, was forced to leave Hong Kong, that is, the Hong Kong British Education Department is using the so-called "politics should not interfere with schools" as a guise to systematically persecute the patriotic education undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong, while at the same time the British authorities in Hong Kong are sheltering and condoning US-Chiang special agents to carry out various political activities against New China. Therefore, the so-called "politics should not interfere with schools" is just a component of the British government's political conspiracy to create "two Chinas." This behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong in persecuting Chinese education undertakings in Hong Kong and being hostile to the Chinese people has aroused the indignation and protests of all patriotic compatriots and the Chinese people in Hong Kong.

　　一系列的阴谋活动证明一个事实：
　　香港英国当局敌视中国人民
　　新华社记者报道香港英国当局迫害杜伯奎的真相
    新华社广州10日电　香港消息：香港英国当局无理将培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境的严重事件，反映出香港英国当局正在以“政治不应介入学校”作为幌子，有计划地摧残香港中国人民的教育事业，并进行着一种反对新中国的政治阴谋活动。
    早在今年1月初，香港英国立法局通过了“1957年教育（修正）条例”。利用这个条例，香港英国当局进行了一连串的迫害香港爱国教育事业及爱国活动的行为。首先在今年2月初，香港英国教育司署硬说劳工子弟学校有“政治活动”，而宣布停止给予经济津贴；2月1日，又以违犯
  “教育条例”的荒谬理由，对种植公会青山支会所办的识字班两个工作人员判罪，与此同时还对另外一些识字班进行无理搜查干扰。5月1日，香港英国当局更横蛮无理地干涉汉华中学等九所学校在节日悬挂中国国旗；5月10日，又禁止新侨中学在校庆日悬挂中国国旗和唱中国国歌。此外，一些爱国学校还受到香港英国当局在校舍、教师注册等问题上给予的麻烦和迫害。香港英国当局无理强迫培侨中学校长杜伯奎离开香港的事件，正是它迫害香港爱国教育事业计划的一部分。
    这些迫害都集中在不准中国人爱中国、干涉和禁止香港学校进行爱国活动的问题上。因此，香港英国教育当局最近极力鼓吹的所谓“政治不应介入学校”，不过是它们用来侵犯和剥夺香港学校的爱国权利的借口罢了。它们在所谓“政治不应介入学校”的幌子后面，隐藏着一种不可告人的反对新中国的政治阴谋。
    最近半年来，许多在中国内地毕业的大学生，都被香港英国教育司署拒绝注册担任教师，有些已经注册的后来又被撤消。培侨中学所聘请的两名在华侨师范学院毕业的教师，在注册后又被香港英国教育司署撤消注册，甚至在学校当局申请将这两个大学毕业生改任小学教师时，也被荒谬地认为“不够资格”。香港英国教育司署负责教师注册的一些官员曾经表示，他遵照上级的指示，他只能批准1949年以前的中国大学毕业生的教师注册，而1949年后的就必须经过教育司署的“详细审查”。
    这种敌视新中国的行为，在今年7月23日香港英国教育司署公布的学校准用中文课本目录中表现得更加露骨。按照这个目录，香港学校完全不能采用中国出版的教科书，香港出版的许多教科书也被禁止采用，而台湾蒋介石集团出版的以及香港美蒋特务机关出版的教科书，却被大量采用。尤其是中国历史和地理两科，全部中、小学教科书都只准采用台湾和美蒋特务在香港出版的教科书，而不能有其他的选择。这些教科书是完全敌视中华人民共和国的。目前在香港官立学校所教授的“社会课本”，就把北京说成是中国的“旧都”，不是首都，教育司署规定官立小学所采用的中国地图，甚至还荒谬地把蒙古人民共和国列为中国的一省，把中国的首都说成南京而不是北京。
    “南华早报”2月5日刊登的一位香港著名医生的来信中还透露了这样一些事实：香港一些官立学校的学生，因为受到警告，不敢到放映中国电影的戏院去看中国的电影；当1956年中国民间艺术团在香港演出的时候，在教育司署工作的教师，也显然因为受到
  “劝告”不敢去看这些表演。
    但是与此同时，在美蒋特务分子所开办的学校中，反对新中国的政治活动，却明目张胆地猖狂进行着。尽管英国政府承认了中华人民共和国，香港英国教育司署却容许香港的美蒋特务分子主办的学校天天悬挂蒋介石集团的旗帜。蒋帮特务“教师”在授课中肆意进行诬蔑中国的政治宣传，也从来没有被干涉过。在蒋帮分子控制下的学校的图书馆中，有许多反动书籍，包括蒋介石的“中国之命运”等等在内。在匈牙利事件期间，香港的蒋帮分子主办的学校，曾经公开几次散发一些反对中华人民共和国的政治宣传小册子，由美国新闻处出版、拍摄的反对中华人民共和国的刊物和电影，也经常在这些美蒋学校中散发和放映；在香港蒋帮分子把持的德明中学的一些集会中，公开大叫“反攻大陆”等反动口号；更猖獗的是在九龙暴乱以后，德明中学一些特务“教师”还公开指导学生举行追悼会，追悼在暴乱中死亡的美蒋特务分子。“反共抗俄救国青年团”这样一个隶属于台湾的特务组织，目前正在美蒋学校中半公开地活动着。这一切，也都没有为香港英国教育当局所干涉过和禁止过。香港英国当局就是这样公然包庇和纵容这些反对新中国的政治活动。
    上面这些众所周知的事实，说明了培侨中学校长杜伯奎被强迫离开香港事件的真相，就是香港英国教育司署正打着所谓“政治不应介入学校”的幌子，来有计划地迫害香港中国人民的爱国教育事业，而同时香港英国当局却包庇和纵容美蒋特务分子进行各种反对新中国的政治活动。因而所谓“政治不应介入学校”不过是英国政府制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋的一个组成部分罢了。香港英国当局这种迫害香港中国教育事业和敌视中国人民的行为，已引起了香港全体爱国同胞和中国人民的愤慨和抗议。
