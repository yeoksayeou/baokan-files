Xinhua News Agency reports: Calls Against US Military Bases Rise
　　Okinawan People Condemn US Occupation Forces for Seizing Land
　　Morocco Wants US Troops Out Philippines Wants to Revise Base Agreement
Xinhua News Agency consolidated report: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The United States is plotting to adopt methods of "indefinite" or "limited-term" land leases in Okinawa in order to permanently occupy the land of the Okinawan people and "legalize" the US establishment of missile bases there.

Booth, the US High Commissioner to Okinawa, and Chogan Togan, Chairman of the Okinawan Government, held formal talks on the so-called "abolition of lump-sum land rent" issue on August 11, and issued a joint statement saying that the two sides discussed the matters agreed upon by both parties at the preparatory meeting on August 8. These matters included changing the lump-sum land rent method to signing "indefinite lease contracts" or "limited-term lease contracts" of five years or less. The two sides decided to submit these matters to the respective special subcommittees for discussion, propose plans, and then be discussed and approved by the plenary meeting of both parties.

The reason why the United States wants to change the method of lump-sum land rent to occupy land in Okinawa is because this imperialist practice has been strongly opposed by the Okinawan farmers. A letter written by Nakamu Takehiko (transliteration), a young Okinawan, published in the US "Workers' Weekly" on the 10th, reflects this anti-American sentiment among Okinawan farmers.

The letter said that the villagers of Kadena Village (central Okinawa Island) and most of the farmers in Okinawa have been protesting against the US seizure of land by paying a lump-sum rent. The land requisitioned by the Americans for bases in Kadena Village accounts for about 70% of the village's farmland. The villagers who have lost their farmland are very angry.

This Okinawan youth angrily asked: Perhaps some people will say that all this is necessary for "defense," so what must we defend? Isn't it a fact that many people don't even have the fields to work in? Isn't it a fact that many workers like me don't have jobs? So what must we oppose? What we must oppose is American militarism, which has forcibly occupied 20% of our Okinawan land.

This time, the United States is playing tricks with "indefinite" or "limited-term" land leases, which has not changed its plot to permanently occupy Okinawa as a military base.

The "Akahata," the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial on the 13th, pointing out that this meeting between representatives of the US government and the so-called "Okinawan delegation" is closely related to the expansion of the US imperialist missile base network in Asia, the establishment of a "Northeast Asian military alliance," and the transportation of nuclear weapons into all US bases in Japan. The editorial called on the Okinawan people and all Japanese people to further launch struggles to oppose the war policies of US imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government.

Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: According to reports, the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the abolition of foreign military bases on Moroccan territory is getting louder and louder in Morocco.

The "Moroccan Labor Union," the largest trade union organization in Morocco, firmly opposes the stationing of foreign armed forces in Morocco. Demonstrations were held at the initiative of this organization to protest the supply of weapons to the US strategic air base in Ben Guerir.

News from Rabat said that Allal al-Fassi, chairman of the ruling party, the "Independence Party," published an article in "Al-Alam" pointing out that the Moroccan government cannot adopt a policy of appeasement towards France, Spain, or the United States now. When talking about US military bases, Fassi wrote that, according to official documents, these bases were established by France on Moroccan territory without the consent of the Moroccan authorities. With the French army about to withdraw from Morocco, it is absolutely illegal for the Americans to remain there.

Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Manila News: Philippine Justice Minister Parella told reporters from the "Herald" on the 8th that in view of the many serious crimes committed by US troops in US military bases on Philippine territory, it is an urgent matter for the government to change some unreasonable situations arising from the US-Philippine Military Base Agreement.

Parella also said that the Philippine authorities should vigorously force the United States to immediately agree to resume Philippine-US negotiations on military bases.

Parella said that the 1956 negotiations on this issue were suspended by the United States.

Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano and Defense Minister Vargas also successively made speeches to support the recent demand by the Philippine Congress to resume Philippine-US negotiations on military bases.

According to newspaper reports, American soldiers at the US Clark Air Base have repeatedly massacred Filipinos. Until recently, twenty Filipinos have been shot and killed by personnel at US military bases for allegedly stealing property.

Such crimes by the US military base authorities have aroused strong indignation in the Philippines. Political leaders such as House Majority Leader Enverga, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Majority Leader Tolentino, House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Mitra, and House Foreign Relations Committee Vice Chairman Milan have all protested the illegal killing of Filipinos by US troops.

### 反对美国军事基地呼声四起　冲绳人民谴责美国占领军霸占土地　摩洛哥要美军滚蛋　菲律宾要修改基地协定

　　反对美国军事基地呼声四起
　　冲绳人民谴责美国占领军霸占土地
　　摩洛哥要美军滚蛋　菲律宾要修改基地协定
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：美国正在阴谋采取“不定期”或“有限期”租用冲绳土地的办法，来永久霸占冲绳人民的土地，并且使美国在那里建立导弹基地的行动“合法化”。
    美国驻冲绳高级专员布思和冲绳政府主席当间重刚11日就所谓“废除一次付清地租办法”问题举行了正式会谈，并且发表联合声明说，双方讨论了8月8日在预备会议上由双方同意了的各项事项。这些事项包括把一次付清地租办法改为签订“不定期租用契约”或五年以下“有限期租用契约”等方式。双方决定把这些事项分别提交各专门小组委员会进行讨论，提出方案，然后再由双方全体会议讨论和批准。
    美国在冲绳所以要改变一次付清地租以霸占土地的办法，是因为这种帝国主义做法受到了冲绳农民的强烈反对。美国“工人周报”在10日刊载冲绳青年中武彦（译音）写的一封信就反映了冲绳农民的这种反美情绪。
    信中说，嘉手纳村（冲绳岛中部）村民们以及冲绳的大部分农民一直在抗议美国用一次付清租价的办法强占土地。美国人在嘉手纳村征作基地用的土地共占全村农地的70％左右。失去了农地的村民们很愤怒。
    这位冲绳青年愤怒地问道：也许会有人说，这一切都是“防务”所必需的，那么，我们必须要保卫的是什么呢？许多人连赖以劳动的田地都没有，难道不是事实么？许多同我一样的工人没有工作做，难道不是事实吗？那么，我们必须反对的是什么呢？我们要反对的就是美国军国主义，它已经把我们冲绳的20％土地强占了。
    美国这次玩弄“不定期”或“有限期”租用土地的花招，并没有改变它永久霸占冲绳作为军事基地的阴谋。
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”13日发表社论指出，美国政府代表和所谓“冲绳代表团”的这次会谈是同扩充美帝国主义在亚洲的导弹基地网、建立“东北亚军事同盟”以及把核武器运进美国在日本的所有基地有着密切联系。社论号召冲绳人民和全体日本人民进一步展开斗争，反对美帝国主义和岸信介政府的战争政策。
    据新华社14日讯　据报道：摩洛哥要求撤出一切外国军队和废除摩洛哥领土上外国军事基地的呼声越来越高。
    摩洛哥最大的工会组织“摩洛哥劳工联盟”坚决反对外国武装部队驻在摩洛哥。根据这个组织的倡议举行了示威运动，抗议给本古里的美国战略空军基地供应武器。
    来自拉巴特的消息说，执政党——“独立党”主席阿拉尔·法席在“旗帜报”发表了一篇文章指出，摩洛哥政府现在不论对法国也好，对西班牙和美国也好，都不能采取姑息的办法。在谈到美国的军事基地时，法席写道，根据官方文件，这些基地是法国在没有得到摩洛哥当局的同意的情况下在摩洛哥领土上设立的。在法国军队即将撤出摩洛哥时，美国人留在那里是绝对不合法的。
    据新华社13日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾司法部长巴雷拉8日对“先驱报”记者说，鉴于在菲律宾领土上的美国军事基地内发生许多重大的美军犯罪事件，因此，改变美菲军事基地协定所产生的一些不合理情况，对政府来说是一件紧要的事。
    巴雷拉又说，菲律宾当局应该大力迫使美国立即同意重新举行菲美关于军事基地的谈判。
    巴雷拉说，1956年关于这个问题的谈判是由美国提出停止的。
    菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺和国防部长瓦加斯也先后发表谈话，支持菲律宾国会最近提出的恢复菲美关于军事基地谈判的要求。
    据报纸报道，美国克拉克军事基地的美国兵一再滥杀菲律宾人。直到最近为止，已经有二十个菲律宾人因被怀疑偷窃财物而遭美国军事基地的人员枪杀。
    美国军事基地当局这种罪行，在菲律宾引起了强烈的愤慨。众议院多数党领袖恩维加、参议院外交委员会多数党领袖托伦蒂诺、众议院外交委员会主席米特拉和众议院外交委员会副主席米兰等政界领袖都曾对美军非法杀死菲律宾人的行为提出抗议。
