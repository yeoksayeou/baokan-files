　　Camping in the Fields
　　Ding Wenquan
　　On the morning of July 30th, before the sun had risen, a group of people arrived in Changtang Township. Walking in front of the banner of the "Ganzhou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Mobile Field Office Team" was Comrade Liu Pinjing, Deputy Secretary of the Ganzhou County Committee, carrying a gas lamp and a telephone. Several others were carrying loads on shoulder poles. These uninvited guests set up camp on a plot of graves in the fields of the Eighth Team of the Nanqiao Commune. After putting down their loads, they unpacked office supplies, tents, cooking oil, salt, firewood, rice, pots, bowls, chopsticks, as well as soil and fertilizer rapid testing instruments, air, ground, and water thermometers, air electric lamps, insect pest prediction lamps, and forty to fifty triangular red and white flags. Then they picked up hoes to dig temporary stoves and put up tents. Deputy Secretary Liu of the County Committee put down his load, took a few red and white flags, and went to the fields to inspect. He first inspected four plots of land belonging to the Eighth Team of the Nanqiao Commune and found that the water storage was too deep and the rice seedlings were covered with green moss. He used his hands to dig open the field ridges to release some of the water and then planted a white flag in the field. He also inspected a 50,000-jin late rice experimental field jointly managed by district, township, commune cadres, and the masses, and found that deep plowing was insufficient and fertilizer was lacking, so he also planted a white flag.
　　After the office team comrades had breakfast, they went deeper into the fields for inspection and found that seedlings were not replanted where there were gaps, weeding and topdressing were not timely, and the standards for high-density planting were not met. In the afternoon, a field inspection, tour, and debate meeting was held with the participation of cadres above the level of team leader from the Nanqiao and Dayu teams. At the field meeting, Deputy Secretary Liu told everyone about the situation discovered during the inspection and urged them to strengthen field management. At the meeting, some team leaders said they did not understand the operating procedures for producing 200,000 to 300,000 jin of high-yield sweet potatoes. Deputy Secretary Liu then gave an operational demonstration. He also made it clear to the cadres that as long as the shortcomings of the fields with white flags were corrected, the white flags could be returned. Therefore, the team cadres who had white flags planted on their land all expressed their determination to work hard and strive to return the white flags to the office team as soon as possible.
　　The commune members praised the cadres' new leadership methods and new leadership style. The masses reflected that the fact that the office, residence, and meals were all in the fields showed that they were truly going deep into reality. Some of the masses praised the office team as an inspection and promotion team, a technical guidance team, a reception team for visits from the masses, and also a labor support team, which was a great inspiration to them.

　　田间扎营
　　丁文全
    7月30日的早晨，太阳还没有出来，一群人来到了长塘乡。走在“中共江西赣县县委巡回田头办公队”的旗帜前面，挑着汽灯、电话机的是中共赣县县委副书记刘品经同志。还有几个人都挑着担子。这些不速之客在南桥社第八队田间的一块坟地上扎下了营盘。他们放下担子，便搬出办公用具、帐篷、油盐柴米、锅头碗筷，还有土壤肥料速测器，气温、地温、水温表，空气电灯，虫情预测灯，还有四、五十面三角红白旗等。接着他们就拿起锄头挖掘临时灶和搭起帐篷。县委刘副书记放下担子，拿了几面红白旗到田间进行检查去了。他首先检查了南桥社八队四丘田，发现储水过深，禾苗又给青苔盖住了，他就用手把田塍挖开放掉一部分水，然后在田中插上一面白旗；他还检查了区、乡、社干部和群众合搞的一丘五万斤晚稻试验田，发现深耕不够，肥料不多，也插上了白旗。
    办公队的同志吃过早饭后，又深入田间检查，发现缺苗未补，耘田追肥也不及时，高度密植规格也不够标准。下午就召开南桥、大宇两个队的队长以上干部参加的田间实地检查参观和辩论会议。在田间会议上，刘副书记把检查中发现的情况告诉了大家，叮嘱要加强田间管理。会上，有的队长说不懂二十至三十万斤高额红薯生产操作规程。刘副书记又进行操作表演。对于插上了白旗的田，也对干部讲清楚了，只要把缺点改正，白旗就可以送回。因而插了白旗的队干部都表示要突击干，争取早日把白旗送回办公队。
    社员群众对干部这种新的领导方法和新的领导作风，称赞不绝。群众反映：办公、住、吃都在田间，这真正是深入实际了。有的群众称赞办公队是检查促进队，又是技术指导队，又是接见群众来访队，还是劳动支援队，对他们鼓舞真大。
