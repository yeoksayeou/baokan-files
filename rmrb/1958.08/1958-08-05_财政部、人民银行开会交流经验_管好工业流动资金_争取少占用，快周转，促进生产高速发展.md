Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 4th. The Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China held an on-site conference in Lüda City in late July to exchange experiences in the management of industrial working capital.

The meeting believed that managing working capital well is a major issue in financial work, banking work, and enterprise work. The amount of working capital nationwide is very large, and with the great leap forward in industrial production, the amount will increase further. Whether working capital can be used well and turned over quickly is related to the high-speed development of industrial production. Under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, industrial production is developing rapidly, and capital, materials, equipment, and labor are also increasing accordingly. However, due to the increase in basic construction investment and the expansion of scale this year, the working capital in various regions cannot be increased much. If the working capital increases too much, it will affect the scale and speed of basic construction. At the same time, excessive accumulation of capital and materials in the production and circulation process will also affect the high-speed development of production. Therefore, how to correctly solve the problem of working capital to promote the Great Leap Forward in production has become an important task at present. The typical experiences of the forty units introduced at this meeting all clearly pointed out the correct path to solve the problem of working capital.

The experiences of various regions have proved that there is great potential to be tapped in the management of working capital. This year, the production of many factories across the country has increased, but they rely on the masses, look downwards, and adopt methods such as digging, salvaging, searching, saving, substituting, and increasing production to tap the internal potential of enterprises. As a result, working capital has not increased much, and some have even decreased compared to previous years. In Lüda City, state-owned industries, with a 40% increase in output value, not only did not increase the working capital occupied, but also decreased by 25 million yuan compared to last year. More than half of the city's factories have seen a good phenomenon of "increasing production without increasing capital, or increasing capital less." Shanghai's local industrial output value plan for this year is to increase by 44.64% compared to last year, while working capital has relatively decreased by more than 280 million yuan. Based on these many facts, the representatives attending the meeting examined and criticized the past erroneous views that the support for production development was insufficient, and sometimes even used finance to decide production, one-sidedly emphasizing financial supervision, and determined to manage working capital with a positive attitude to promote the Great Leap Forward in production in the future.

The experience introduced at this meeting shows that putting politics in command, relying on the whole party, and mobilizing the masses are the fundamental factors for managing working capital well. Shenyang City launched a "Five Digs" campaign by mobilizing the masses, and quickly excavated more than 50,000 tons of scrap steel and more than 4,000 sets of machinery and equipment, transferred more than 5,000 laborers and 220,000 square meters of houses, and saved more than 100 million yuan of working capital.

This meeting also introduced the experience of decentralized capital management, decentralization of financial power, and reform of rules and regulations. In the past, a few people managed the funds, always thinking, "I am managing other people's funds," and did not understand how to promote democracy under centralized leadership, did not trust the masses, and managed things too rigidly and meticulously, which affected the enthusiasm of the masses. Now, the implementation of decentralized capital management allows those who manage materials to also manage money. Everyone cares about funds, thereby changing the past phenomenon of mutual uncoordination between financial departments and supply, production, and sales departments, and jointly improving capital management. After the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant implemented decentralized capital management and simplified procedures, materials and funds were rarely stockpiled. The capital turnover period in the second quarter was shortened to 74 days, more than half shorter than the average turnover period of 168 days last year; saving more than 7.5 million yuan in capital. In the past, a purchasing agent had to go through six procedures to apply for a payment; now the procedures are convenient, and they can take the check to purchase themselves. The unreasonable system of so-called "money for buying oil cannot be used to buy vinegar" has also been eliminated. Because factories in Lüda City rely on the masses to manage funds, the capital turnover has been greatly accelerated; this year, the capital turnover period will be 31 days faster than last year, relatively saving more than 140 million yuan in capital.

    财政部、人民银行开会交流经验
    管好工业流动资金
    争取少占用，快周转，促进生产高速发展
    据新华社旅大4日电　财政部和中国人民银行7月下旬在旅大市召开现场会议，交流工业流动资金管理的经验。
    会议认为，管好流动资金，是财政工作、银行工作和企业工作中的一个大问题。全国流动资金的数额很大，随着工业生产大跃进，数额还要增加。流动资金能否使用得好，周转得快，关系到工业生产的高速度发展。在全国大跃进的形势下，工业生产飞跃发展，资金、材料、设备、劳动力也在相应增加。但是今年由于基本建设投资增多，规模扩大，各地流动资金不可能增加很多。如果流动资金增加过多，就会影响基本建设的规模和速度。同时在生产和流通过程中积压的资金和物资过多了，也将影响生产的高速度发展。因此，如何正确地解决流动资金问题，来促进生产大跃进，就成了当前的一个重要任务。这次会议介绍的四十个单位的典型经验，都突出地指明了怎样解决流动资金问题的正确道路。
    各地的经验证明：在流动资金管理上，大有潜力可挖。今年全国许多工厂生产增加了，但是它们依靠群众，眼睛向下，采取挖、捞、找、省、代和增产的方法，把企业内部潜力挖掘出来，结果流动资金却增加不多，有的还比往年减少。旅大市国营工业在产值增长40％的情况下，占用的流动资金不但未增加，反而比去年减少两千五百万元。全市已有半数以上的工厂出现了“增产不增资，或者少增资”的好现象。上海市今年地方工业产值计划比去年增长44.64％，而流动资金却相对地减少两亿八千多万元。根据这许多事实，参加会议的代表检查和批判了过去对生产发展支持不够，有时甚至要以财务决定生产，片面强调财务监督的错误观点，决心今后要以推动生产大跃进的积极态度，来管好流动资金。
    这次会议介绍的经验说明：政治挂帅，依靠全党，发动群众，是管好流动资金的根本因素。沈阳市发动群众开展“五挖”运动，很快就挖掘出五万多吨废钢铁和四千多台机器设备，调剂出五千多名劳动力和二十二万平方公尺房屋，节省出一亿多元流动资金。
    这次会议还介绍了资金分管、财权下放、改革规章制度的经验。过去少数人管资金，总认为“我是管人家的”，不懂得在集中领导下发扬民主，不相信群众，管得过死过细，反而影响群众的积极性。现在实行资金分管，使管物的人又管钱，大家都关心资金，从而改变过去财务部门和供应、生产、推销等部门互不协调的现象，共同搞好资金管理。大连机车车辆厂实行资金分管、减化手续以后，材料、资金都很少积压，第二季度资金周转期缩短到七十四天，比去年平均周转期一百六十八天缩短一半多；节约资金七百五十多万元。过去采购员请领一次款要办理六道手续；现在手续便当，自拿支票去采购。那种所谓“买油的钱不能打醋”的不合理制度，也都革除掉了。旅大市各工厂因为依靠群众管理资金，资金周转都大大加快；今年资金周转期要比去年加快三十一天，相对地节约资金一亿四千多万元。
