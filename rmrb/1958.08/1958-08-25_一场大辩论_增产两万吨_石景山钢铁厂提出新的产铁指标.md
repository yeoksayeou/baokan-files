　　A Grand Debate: Increasing Production by 20,000 Tons
　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Proposes New Iron Production Targets

　　(Our dispatch) The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have been using the methods of extensive airing of views, posting big-character posters, and holding grand debates in recent days, examining the implementation of the national plan and the Great Leap Forward plan for this year at the workshop, work section, and team levels. In the examination, the workers criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and proposed various technical measures. This not only completely and reliably ensured the overfulfillment of the national plan but also led to the proposal of a higher, new Great Leap Forward plan. The plant's workers also proposed to accomplish in one vigorous effort, the construction of four small converters within half a month, putting them into production on September 10th, and producing 20,000 tons of steel this year. This will change the plant's situation of only producing iron and not steel for many years in the fastest possible way.

　　The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's production plan for pig iron this year has leapfrogged five times, from 450,000 tons to 540,000 tons. In the first half of the year, monthly work plans were all completed. In July, the work plan was not completed because of the inability to overcome the difficulties of the rainy season and changes in raw material conditions. As a result, some people began to waver and wanted to revise the plan and lower the targets. In the recent major inspection, the plant's workers posted more than 70,000 big-character posters in three days and concentratedly criticized this thinking at large and small meetings. The workers pointed out that the reason the plan was not completed in July was not because the plan was "rashly advanced," but because of the following reasons: First, the "theory of conditions being the only factor" was rearing its head again among some cadres, regarding the changes in raw material conditions as insurmountable difficulties, and regarding the reduction in production during the rainy season as inevitable. Therefore, they did not actively overcome the difficulties, which affected production. Second, some leading cadres did not consult with the masses when encountering difficulties, but simply locked themselves in their offices and worried. Third, the technical revolution was not closely integrated with the key problems in current production. For example, there were many electrical accidents, but the electrical workshop's five technical innovations in the first half of the year were all unrelated to safe power supply.

　　After the workers extensively aired their views, the Great Leap Forward plan for an annual output of 540,000 tons of pig iron was not only guaranteed but also raised to the production of 560,000 tons. Their main measures are: First, adding three sintering pots to increase the production of sintered ore by 20,000 tons this year, which will change the proportion of blast furnace charge and produce more iron. Second, injecting hot air with tar to increase the wind temperature of the four blast furnaces from over 900 degrees to over 1,000 degrees. Currently, this major technological innovation has been achieved. Third, further improving smelting intensity and improving blast furnace utilization coefficient.

　　After the ideological emancipation of the plant's workers, it was also decided that, in addition to quickly completing the expansion task, they would build four three-ton converters in the shortest possible time to produce steel for the country as soon as possible. No sooner said than done, they made this decision on the 22nd and started construction on the 23rd. They bought several sets of ready-made standard drawings, and the manufacturing workshop began to manufacture the converters themselves. From construction to installation, everything is contracted by themselves; the total construction time is only half a month. By September 10th, this plant will be able to produce steel.

### 一场大辩论　增产两万吨  石景山钢铁厂提出新的产铁指标

　　一场大辩论　增产两万吨
    石景山钢铁厂提出新的产铁指标
    本报讯　石景山钢铁厂职工连日来采用大鸣大放、大字报大辩论的方法，分别按车间、工段、小组，全面检查了今年国家计划和跃进计划的执行情况。职工们在检查中批判了右倾保守思想，提出了各种技术措施，不仅使超额完成国家计划有了完全可靠的保证，而且又提出了更高的新的跃进计划。这个厂的职工还提出要一鼓作气，在半个月内，建起四座小转炉，9月10日投入生产，今年产钢两万吨。这样就能以最快的速度改变这个厂多年来只产铁不产钢的局面。
    石景山钢铁厂今年的生铁生产计划，一连跃进了五次，从四十五万吨跃进到五十四万吨。上半年，每月作业计划都完成了；7月间，因为没有能很好地克服雨季和原料条件变化的困难，作业计划没有完成。于是，有些人思想动摇起来，想修改计划，降低指标。在最近的大检查中，全厂职工三天贴出七万多张大字报，并在大会小会上集中地批判了这种思想。职工们指出：7月份所以没有完成计划，并不是因为计划“冒进”，而是由于以下原因：首先，部分干部中“唯条件论”的思想又在抬头，把原料条件的变化看做是不可克服的困难，把雨季减产看成是不可避免的事情，因此没有积极去克服困难，结果影响了生产；其次，有些领导干部碰到困难不同群众商量，只是自己关在办公室里发愁；再次，技术革命没有很密切地结合当前生产中的关键问题，例如电气方面发生了多次事故，而电力车间上半年的五项技术革新都同安全供电无关。
    经过职工大鸣大放，年产五十四万吨生铁的跃进计划不但有了保证，而且又提高到生产五十六万吨。他们的主要措施是：一、增添三个烧结锅，今年增产烧结矿二万吨，这样就可以改变高炉配料比例，做到多出铁。二、热风喷焦油，把四个高炉的风温都由九百多度提高到一千度以上。目前，这一重大技术革新已经实现。三、进一步提高冶炼强度，改善高炉利用系数。
    全厂职工思想大解放以后，还决定除迅速完成扩建任务以外，要以最短的时间，建起四个三吨的转炉，早日为国家生产出钢来。说干就干，他们在22日作出这个决定，23日就开始动工。他们买了几份现成的标准图纸，制造车间就自己制造起转炉来。从施工到安装，完全自己包干；全部建设时间，只要半个月。到9月10日，这个厂就可以生产出钢来了。
