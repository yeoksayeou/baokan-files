    Warning to the American and British Aggressors!
    Aggressors, Get Out!
    Combat Hero Zhang Ming
    The aggressive troops of American and British imperialism have ferociously entered Lebanon and Jordan, which is not only an interference in the national independence movements in the Middle East, but also a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world.
    We Chinese people need a peaceful environment to carry out socialist construction; the people of the whole world also hope to establish lasting peace. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. On the Korean battlefield, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought the American aggressors together. The result of the contest proved that American imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. We warn the American and British aggressors, get out of the Middle East immediately, otherwise you will suffer a shameful defeat like in Korea and Egypt; if you dare to provoke a world war, we will fight with the people of the world until we send you to the grave.
    Deal with Mad Dogs with Sticks!
    Volunteer Army First-Class Hero Qin Jianbin
    Hearing that American and British imperialism sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, I was naturally reminded of the situation on the Korean battlefield seven years ago. Seven years ago, as a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, I took on the sacred duty of defending the motherland and world peace and went to the Korean battlefield. In our thousands of miles of pursuit of the invading army, we could see the brutal crimes of the American aggressors everywhere: peaceful towns and villages were bombed and burned by American planes, and innocent people were massacred everywhere. During a night march, I saw a Korean woman who had just been stabbed to death by American soldiers lying on the ground, and a child of about two years old was crawling on the dead mother's body, crying loudly, the mother's blood staining the child's whole body. We all shed tears when we saw this scene. As the saying goes: if a wolf is not killed, it will eat people even if it goes to the end of the world. Today, the claws of American and British aggressors have reached the heads of the people in the Middle East, and even more barbaric acts of aggression are about to be replayed in the Middle East. We are the defenders of world peace, and we must not stand idly by. We will never allow the American and British imperialist robbers to act recklessly. The facts of the Korean War show that the best way to deal with imperialist mad dogs is to beat them hard. Mad dogs are not scary. If these two mad dogs, American and British imperialism, dare to continue biting people, the people of the world will surely smash them to pieces!
    Have you forgotten the lessons?
    Volunteer Army Second-Class Merit Citation Recipient Wu Xiangzhi
    When I heard the news that American and British imperialism had invaded the Middle East again, I couldn't help but feel angry, and I couldn't help but think of the losers under my command on the Korean battlefield.
    The air force units of the Chinese People's Volunteers were not much stronger than the American air force in terms of tactics and technology. However, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the strong support and help of fraternal units, and our own hard work to continuously improve our technology and tactics, we were finally tempered in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, improved ourselves, and repelled the enemy's many large-scale air raids. I remember once when we were searching over Pyongyang, we encountered four enemy planes at an altitude of 3,000 meters and a distance of 5,000 meters. Our lead plane immediately ordered the wingman group to provide cover and launched a surprise attack on the enemy, shooting down two enemy planes at once. The enemy planes went crazy and began to fight us. When we finished our third attack, three enemy planes had already crashed into the sea, burning fiercely, and the other one was seriously injured and forced to land on the northeast sea of Xidao, southwest of Pyongyang. This air battle was a battle in which the enemy was completely annihilated. It proves that the so-called world's first-class powerful air force is indeed a paper tiger.
    Everyone is familiar with Comrade Lu Min, an aerial hero who is good at fighting F-86s, right? Didn't he shoot down two enemy F-86s in fourteen seconds in one battle? I also participated in this battle. May I ask the American imperialist pilots, why can't you find anyone in your own history who shot down two planes in fourteen seconds? The reason is very simple, because the American aggressors came for money and beauties, and they were very afraid of death, so they wanted to run away as soon as they got into battle. Our Chinese revolutionary soldiers are essentially different from American soldiers. We fight for the independence and security of the motherland, for the happiness of the people, and for world peace, so we stand up and fight, and defeat the American imperialist aggression in Korea.
    American and British aggressors, have you forgotten the lessons of hitting your heads and bleeding in the Korean War so quickly?
    Get out of the Middle East!
    Volunteer Army First-Class Hero Huang Jiafu
    The American and British imperialists' dispatch of troops to interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan has aroused great anger in my heart! American and British imperialists have killed countless Chinese, Koreans, and Egyptians, and now they are extending their blood-stained hands to kill the Arab people, trying to strangle the national liberation movement in the Middle East. War-mongers Eisenhower, Dulles, and Macmillan, I warn you, recall the lessons of Korea and Egypt! Those who play with fire will burn themselves. Victory always belongs to the righteous people.
    No matter what excuses you fabricate there, you can't deceive a three-year-old child. The Lebanese people will handle the internal affairs of Lebanon themselves, and they don't need your troops to "protect" them; the territory of Lebanon is hundreds of thousands of miles away from you, and it can't threaten your "security". The people of the whole world are condemning and cursing your act of aggression. We shout: American robbers get out of Lebanon! British robbers get out of Jordan!
    In order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and support the people of the Middle East, I must further study military technology, hold the weapons in my hands tightly, be a hundred times more vigilant, and struggle unremittingly for the cause of peace. We resolutely support the national liberation movement of the Lebanese people, the Iraqi people, and the Arab people. Victory must also belong to the Arab people.
    Not allowing the aggressors to massacre the people of the Middle East
    Tashan Hero Cheng Yuanmao
    Just as we were cheering for Iraq's victory in its struggle for freedom and independence, American and British imperialists, ignoring the opposition of the people of the world, sent troops to invade the Middle East. As a result, the sovereignty of Lebanon and Jordan has been trampled on, and the young Republic of Iraq and peace in the Middle East and the world have been seriously threatened. This is the most blatant violation of the United Nations Charter by American and British imperialism, a slander of truth and justice, and a mad provocation to the Arab people and all peace-loving people in the world. This is truly a heinous crime and fills people with righteous indignation.
    In order to cover up their ugly faces, the imperialists are waving the banners of "invitation" from the Lebanese and Jordanian governments and "protecting the safety of their nationals," which are completely tricks. We have seen these tricks long ago in the Liberation War and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and they cannot deceive anyone! The invasion of the Middle East by American and British imperialism is a step in their dream of invading countries in the socialist camp. In the Liberation War, bullets marked "U.S.A." pierced my body, and shrapnel marked "U.S.A." injured my arm. On the Korean battlefield, imperialist guns and bullets massacred countless innocent people, so we must not sit idly by and watch the shameless aggression of American and British imperialism! We must not allow American and British aggressors to massacre the people of the Middle East again!
    Mad dogs remember eating but not getting beaten Wei Ping
    I am a machine gunner in the Volunteer Army,
    I beat the American mad dogs at Shangganling.
    For peace, I returned to the motherland,
    I took off my military uniform not long ago.
    Seeing the people of the Middle East being invaded,
    I am trembling with anger!
    My hands are trembling, my heart is trembling,
    Excited hot blood flows all over my body.
    Mad dogs remember eating but not getting beaten,
    There is only one way: beat them hard!
    For justice, for peace,
    For the people of the world to enjoy freedom.

### 警告美英侵略者！

    警告美英侵略者！
    侵略者，滚回去！
    战斗英雄　张明
    美英帝国主义的侵略军队穷凶极恶地进入黎巴嫩和约旦，不仅是对中近东地区民族独立运动的干涉，而且也是对世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅。
    我们中国人民需要一个和平环境来进行社会主义建设；全世界人民也都希望建立持久的和平。我们热爱和平，但也不怕战争。在朝鲜战场上，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，同美国侵略军作过较量，较量的结果证明美帝国主义不过是个纸老虎。我们警告美英侵略者，你们立即从中东滚出去，否则就会像在朝鲜、埃及一样遭到可耻的失败；如果你们胆敢要挑起世界大战的话，我们将和全世界人民一道进行战斗，直到把你们送进坟墓为止。
    用棍棒对付疯狗！
    志愿军一级英雄　秦建彬
    听到美、英帝国主义派兵侵略黎巴嫩和约旦以后，使我很自然地想起七年前朝鲜战场上的情况，七年前，我作为中国人民志愿军的一个战士，肩负着保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的神圣义务，走上了朝鲜战场。在我们追击侵略军的数千里长途中，到处都可以看到美国侵略者的残暴罪行：和平的城镇和乡村被美机炸平、烧光，到处是被屠杀的无辜人民。在一次夜行军中，我看到一个刚被美国兵刺死的朝鲜妇女躺在地上，一个两岁左右的孩子，在惨死的母亲身上爬来爬去，哇哇啼哭，母亲的血染红了孩子的全身。看了这种情景，我们都掉了眼泪。俗话说：狼不打死，走到天边也要吃人。今天，美英侵略者的爪子又伸到中东人民的头上来了，更野蛮的侵略兽行又要在中东重演。我们是世界和平的保卫者，决不能袖手旁观，决不容许美英帝国主义强盗胡作非为。朝鲜战争的事实说明：对付帝国主义疯狗的最好的办法，就是狠狠地揍它。疯狗并没有什么可怕。美、英帝国主义这两条疯狗，如果还敢继续咬人，全世界人民一定会把它们打得粉身碎骨！
    忘记教训了吗？
    志愿军二等功臣　吴祥志
    看到美英帝国主义又侵略中东的消息，我禁不住怒火中烧，也禁不住又想起在朝鲜战场上的手下败将来。
    中国人民志愿军的空军部队，要从战术和技术上来讲，都不比美国空军强多少。但是由于我们有毛主席和中国共产党的领导，有兄弟部队的大力支援和帮助，再加上我们自己的刻苦钻研、不断提高技术战术，终于在抗美援朝中得到了锻炼，提高了自己，击退了敌人多次大机群的空袭。记得有一次在平壤上空搜索，遇到敌机四架、高度三千，距离五千公尺。我们的长机即命令僚机组掩护，给敌人以突然的袭击，一下子就击落了两架敌机。敌机疯狂了，开始和我们搏斗，当我们攻击完第三次的时候，敌机已经有三架坠落到海中，燃起大火，另外一架负重伤在平壤西南席岛东北海面强迫降落。这次空战是敌人全部被歼的一次战斗。它证明所谓世界上第一流强大空军实实在在是只纸老虎。
    大家都很熟悉空中英雄打F—86的能手鲁珉同志吧，他不是在一次战斗里在十四秒钟内击落敌F—86两架吗？这次战斗我也参加了。试问美帝国主义的飞行员，为什么在自己的历史上找不出在十四秒钟内击落两架飞机的呢？这个原因很简单，就是因为美国侵略军是为金钱美女而来的，他们非常怕死，所以他们一到战斗中就想逃跑。我们中国的革命战士和美国兵有本质上的区别。我们是为了祖国的独立和安全，为了人民的幸福，为了世界的和平，所以我们挺身而战，打败了美帝国主义在朝鲜的进攻。
    美英侵略者，难道你们就那么快地忘记在朝鲜战争中碰得头破血流的教训了吗？
    滚出中东去！
    志愿军一级英雄　黄家富
    美英帝国主义出兵干涉黎巴嫩和约旦内政，引起我内心极大的怒火！美英帝国主义者杀害了无数的中国人、朝鲜人、埃及人，现在又伸出血淋淋的双手，来杀害阿拉伯人民，妄想扼杀中东的民族解放运动。战争贩子艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、麦克米伦，我警告你们，好好回忆一下在朝鲜、埃及的教训吧！玩火者是要自焚的，胜利永远属于正义的人们。
    尽管你们在那里捏造什么借口，也骗不了三岁的小孩。黎巴嫩内政黎巴嫩的人民自己会处理，不需要你们的军队来“保护”；黎巴嫩的国土离你们有十万八千里，也威胁不了你们的“安全”。你们这种侵略行为，全世界的人民在谴责你，咒骂你，我们高呼：美国强盗滚出黎巴嫩去！英国强盗滚出约旦去！
    为了保卫祖国社会主义建设，支援中东人民，我一定要进一步钻研军事技术，握紧手中武器，百倍提高警惕，为和平事业而不懈地斗争。我们坚决支持黎巴嫩人民、支持伊拉克人民、支持阿拉伯人民的民族解放运动。胜利也一定属于阿拉伯人民。
    不让侵略者屠杀中东人民
    塔山英雄　程远茂
    正当我们为伊拉克争取自由独立获得胜利而欢呼的时候，美英帝国主义者不顾全世界人民的反对，出兵侵略中东。因此，黎、约主权遭到践踏，年轻的伊拉克共和国和中东以及世界和平遭到严重威胁。这是美英帝国主义对联合国宪章最粗暴的破坏，对真理与正义的污蔑，对阿拉伯人民及全世界爱好和平人民的疯狂挑衅。这真是罪恶滔天，令人义愤填膺。
    帝国主义为了掩盖自己丑恶的面貌，打着应黎、约政府的“邀请”、“保卫本国侨民安全”的旗帜，这完全是花招。这些勾当我们早在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中见过了，是骗不了人的！美英帝国主义侵略中东是梦想侵略社会主义阵营国家的一个步骤。在解放战争中，带着U·S·A·的弹头打穿过我的身体，带着U·S·A·的弹片炸伤过我的臂膀。在朝鲜战场上，帝国主义的枪弹，屠杀了无数无辜的人民，因此我们决不能坐视美英帝国主义的无耻侵略！决不许美英侵略者再来屠杀中东人民！
    疯狗记吃不记打　未平
    我是志愿军的机枪手，
    上甘岭揍过美国恶疯狗。
    为和平撤回祖国来，
    脱下军装还不久。
    看见中东人民遭侵略，
    气得我浑身颤抖！
    手颤抖心颤抖，
    激动的热血遍身流。
    疯狗记吃不记打，
    一个办法狠狠揍！
    为正义，为和平，
    为世界人民享自由。
