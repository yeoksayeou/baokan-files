Even Indigenous Methods Should Emphasize Advancement
　　Jing Yu
　　The Yingchao Iron Works in Shanxi province has created a unique type of indigenous blast furnace that produces more than 1,800 jin of gray cast iron per furnace per day, more than three times the output of the original indigenous blast furnaces. This is a pioneering achievement in indigenous iron smelting and is worthy of widespread promotion.
　　Although the iron-smelting method of the Yingchao Iron Works still belongs to the "indigenous" category, its style is different: First, it does not use steel or iron plates for the furnace body, nor does it use refractory bricks to build the furnace lining; it only uses blue bricks and ceramics to build the furnace. Second, it does not use coke as fuel, only anthracite coal. Third, ordinary indigenous blast furnaces require hot blast stoves to produce gray cast iron, while this indigenous blast furnace uses cold blast to smelt gray cast iron. Fourth, ordinary indigenous blast furnaces have a daily output of five or six hundred jin, while this indigenous blast furnace has a daily output of nearly two thousand jin. In short, the indigenous blast furnace created by the Yingchao Iron Works is more indigenous than in the past in terms of some equipment, but its output is higher than in the past. It is now more convenient than ever to build such indigenous blast furnaces in all places with iron and coal mines.
　　After indigenous methods were adopted, some iron smelting units made partial improvements in production equipment and operating techniques, achieving certain results. However, some people still have doubts about whether there are advanced factors and advanced methods in indigenous methods. In their view, indigenous methods are nothing more than a synonym for backwardness and have nothing advanced. Others, seeing a few minor problems with indigenous blast furnaces, loudly proclaim the "short life theory" of indigenous blast furnaces, believing that the lifespan of indigenous methods is always short, fantasizing about quickly replacing them with foreign methods. Facts have shattered these people's fallacies. There is much to be said for indigenous methods. Old experiences that have been used for thousands of years are called indigenous methods; absorbing the advantages of various indigenous methods and improving them is also called indigenous methods; creating a new method to replace foreign methods in the absence of indigenous methods is also called indigenous methods. All kinds of indigenous methods involve the question of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Although outdated indigenous methods can also produce steel, their effects will appear less, slower, worse, and sometimes more costly compared with advanced indigenous methods. An advanced indigenous blast furnace has a daily output two to three times higher than an outdated indigenous blast furnace. If all indigenous blast furnaces in the country adopt advanced methods, their output will immediately increase sharply by two to three times. From this, it can be seen how meaningful it is to promptly discover and promote advanced factors, advanced creations, and advanced methods in indigenous methods under the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, for increasing production and accelerating the speed of construction!
　　Currently, all tasks are being carried out with full energy and striving for high speed. In the process of advancing at high speed, who runs the fastest and who runs the slowest depends on whether they have mastered advanced methods. The fact is that whoever masters advanced methods will make rapid progress; whoever ignores advanced methods will fall behind. Since the emergence of the indigenous blast furnace of the Yingchao Iron Works in Shanxi province, many indigenous blast furnaces have already appeared to be falling behind. Falling behind is not a terrible thing; as long as one is determined to learn advanced methods, one will immediately catch up.
　　In the struggle to compete for speed, we must not only constantly create new tools and improve production methods, but also vigorously promote new tools and new production methods. Invention and creation are for promotion and application. The combination of creation and promotion will improve the production level of the entire society, and the speed of production and construction will be faster.
　　Today, this newspaper introduces the experience of the Yingchao Iron Works in creating indigenous blast furnaces. We hope that the experience of the Yingchao Iron Works will blossom and bear fruit everywhere.

    土法也要讲究先进
    静宇
    山西应朝铁业社制造了一种别具风格的土高炉，每炉日产灰生铁一千八百多斤，比原来土高炉的产量提高三倍多。这是土法炼铁中的创举，值得普遍推广。
    应朝社的炼铁方法虽然仍然属于土字之类，而它的风格却与众不同：第一、它不用钢板或铁板做炉身，也不用耐火砖砌炉膛，只用青砖和陶瓷就把炉子砌好了。第二、它不用焦炭作燃料，只用无烟煤就行了。第三、一般的土高炉要用热风炉才能炼出灰生铁，而这个土高炉采用冷风就把灰生铁炼出来了。第四、一般土高炉日产量为五六百斤，而这个土高炉日产量将近两千斤。总之，应朝铁业社创制的土高炉，在部分设备上比过去更土了，而产量却比过去更高了。一切有铁矿和煤矿的地方要建设这样的土高炉比过去更方便了。
    土法上马以后，有些炼铁单位在生产设备和操作技术上做了部分改进，收到了一定的成效，但也有一些人对于土法当中有没有先进的因素和先进的方法，却抱着怀疑态度。在他们看来，土法不过是落后的代名词，没有什么先进的东西。还有一些人看到土高炉出了一点小毛病，就大叫土高炉短寿论，认为土法的寿命总是不长的。幻想很快用洋法来代替。事实打破了这些人的谬论。土法里面大有讲究，沿用几千年的老经验，叫做土法；摄取各种土法的优点加以提高，也叫做土法；从没有土法的情况下创造一种新的办法来代替洋法，也叫做土法。各种各样的土法，都有多快好省问题。陈旧的土法，虽然也能生产出钢铁来，它的效果同先进的土法比起来，就会显得少些、慢些、差些，有的还会费些。一个先进的土高炉日产量要比陈旧的土高炉高出两三倍，假使全国所有的土高炉都采用先进的方法，它的产量就会立即猛增两三倍。由此可见，在土洋并举的方针下，及时发现土法当中先进的因素、先进的创造和先进的方法，加以推广，对于提高生产、加快建设速度，该是多么有意义的事情啊！？
    现在，各项工作都在鼓足干劲，力争高速度；在高速度前进中谁跑得最快，谁跑得最慢，关键在于是否掌握了先进的方法。事实正是这样：谁掌握了先进的方法，谁就突飞猛进；谁忽视了先进的方法，谁就会落在后面。山西应朝铁业社的土高炉出世以后，许多土高炉已经显得落在后面了。落后不是可怕的事情，只要决心学习先进方法，就会立刻赶上去。
    在比速度的斗争中，我们既要不断地创造新的工具改进生产方法，同时，还要大力地推广新的工具和新的生产方法。创造发明是为了推广和应用，创造和推广相结合，整个社会的生产水平就提高了，生产建设的速度也就会更快了。
    今天，本报介绍了应朝社创造土高炉的经验，希望应朝社的经验遍地开花，到处结果。
