    Shijingshan Power Plant "Hatching a Big Egg"
    Contracting to Build a Thermal Power Plant Ten Times Larger Than Itself
    (Our newspaper, August 3rd, reporter Zhao Shenying) Shijingshan Power Plant, with a capacity of over 110,000 kilowatts, is actively preparing to build a thermal power plant more than ten times its size. This power plant will have a generating capacity of over one million kilowatts, and the entire process, from basic construction to future production, will be contracted by the plant.

    Although Shijingshan Power Plant is much smaller than the power plant it is contracting to build, the plant's employees believe they have sufficient conditions to undertake the basic construction and future production of the power plant. The main engineering work is installation, and the plant has many veteran maintenance workers. With the rapid training of some young workers, they can take on this task. When the power plant goes into production in the future, operating workers can be trained through the method of apprenticeships.

    The plant's leadership, based on the workload of the new power plant, has decided to take the following measures:

    During the basic construction phase, a basic construction office will be established within the old plant. The future financial and material supply work will be completely handled by the old plant's accounting and supply departments. At the same time, 500 people will be transferred and trained to form an installation brigade to undertake boiler, turbine, electrical, thermal instrumentation, and repair work (civil engineering will be contracted by the Beijing Construction Company).

    When production begins in the future, all personnel needed by the plant will be transferred from the old plant or trained in-house. The existing six engineers will manage the affairs of both plants. One repair shop will be responsible for the maintenance of machines in both plants (relevant leaders are considering merging the two plants in the future).

    Some people say, Shijingshan Power Plant is "hatching a big egg", can it really be done? The basic construction of a million-kilowatt power plant requires two million workdays, where will you get the people? The person in charge of the plant said: If we are going to do it, we won't need so many people for so many days. We want to improve efficiency. There will be no wasted work in our construction team, we will go all out. Of course, building a million-kilowatt power plant is difficult, but we will overcome the difficulties ourselves. That's what "hatching a big egg" means, otherwise how can it be called "laying a big egg"?

    Mass activities to prepare for contracting the new power plant are booming throughout the plant. The electrical workshop, which used to only be responsible for maintenance, has established two shock brigades and is manufacturing 200 welding machines and some transformers that will be needed in the future. The boiler workshop is actively carrying out small-scale mechanization activities to change manual labor to mechanization in order to meet the heavy tasks after the start of the contracting project. They have manufactured sawing machines, polishing machines, and pipe beveling tools to mechanize tasks such as hand-sawing pipes, hand-filing, and hand-beveling pipe ends. Workers in each workshop, upon hearing that welders will be needed in the future, are eagerly signing up to learn welding.

    Now, many employees and their families are rushing to the new power plant construction site to participate in voluntary labor. The workers said: We are the workers of the capital. The new power plant is a large-scale thermal power plant in the country. We must not only use less money and generate more electricity, but also be determined to make the technology of installation and operation reach world standards.

### 石景山发电厂小鸡孵大蛋  包建一座比本厂大十倍的火电站

    石景山发电厂小鸡孵大蛋
    包建一座比本厂大十倍的火电站
    本报3日讯　记者赵慎应报道：拥有十一万多瓩的石景山发电厂，正在积极筹建一个比本厂大十倍以上的火力发电站。这个发电站的发电量将有一百多万瓩，从基本建设到将来的生产，都将由这个工厂全部包干。
    石景山发电厂虽然比它要包建的发电站小得很多，但是这个厂的职工认为有充分条件可以把发电站的基本建设和将来的生产包下来。包建的主要工程是安装工作，这个厂有不少老检修工人，再迅速培养一些青年工人，就可以担负起这个任务。发电站将来投入生产时，运行工人可以用带徒弟的办法带出来。
    这个厂的领导上，已经根据新电站的工程量，决定采取以下措施：
    在进行基本建设的时候，在老厂内设立一个基本建设处，将来的财务、材料供应工作，完全由老厂的会计科和供应科全部包下来。同时抽调和培训五百个人，成立一个安装大队，承担锅炉、汽机、电气、热工、修配等工作（土建工程由北京市建筑公司承包）。
    将来投入生产时，这个厂所需要的人员全由老厂抽调或自己培训；现有的六个工程师，将来办两个厂里的事；一个检修车间管修两个厂的机器（有关领导方面正在考虑将来把两个厂干脆合并在一起）。
    有人说，石景山发电厂小鸡孵大蛋，能不能下下来？百万电站的基建工程需要两百万个工，你们的人在哪里？这个厂的负责人说：我们要干决不要这么多人干这么多天，我们要提高效率。我们的建设队伍里，没有窝工，我们要鼓足干劲。当然建设一个百万电站有困难，有困难自己克服，这才是小鸡孵大蛋，不然怎么叫下大蛋。
    为包建新电站作准备工作的群众活动，已在全厂蓬勃展开。一向只管检修的电气工段成立两个突击队，正在制造将来需要的二百台电焊机和一部分变压器。锅炉工段正积极开展小型机械化活动，改变手工作业为机械化，来迎接包建工程开工后的繁重任务。他们已制造出了锯管机、磨光机、管子划坡口工具等机械，把双手拉锯管、手工锉光、手工铲管头坡口等工作全都机械化了。各工段工人听说将来要电焊工，都纷纷报名学焊工。
    现在，这个厂的很多职工和职工家属，都争先恐后地到新电站工地上参加义务劳动。工人们说：我们是首都的工人，新电站是全国的大型火电站，我们不仅要少用钱，多发电，还要决心使安装、运行的技术达到世界水平。
