Seize the Last Four Months: Production Front Compares Heroes
    Dada Electric Factory Revises Targets, Transformer Output Increases More Than Fiftyfold Compared to Last Year

    (Our Shanghai Dispatch, August 22) With less than five months remaining this year, the Shanghai Joint State-Private Dada Electric Factory has recently put forward new leap forward targets. This further leap forward has increased the annual transformer output target from 400,000 kVA to 1,000,000 kVA, an increase of more than fifty times compared to the factory's output last year, greatly exceeding the total transformer output of Shanghai last year.

    Dada Factory is a small factory with just over a hundred people. The factory building is an old warehouse with limited space, and the offices, dormitories, and canteens are built on the roof of the warehouse. In addition to a dozen machine tools and several winding machines modified by the workers themselves, much of the work is done manually. This target of 1,000,000 kVA is the factory's fifth leap forward this year. Last year, the factory only produced more than 18,000 kVA of transformers; at the beginning of this year, the proposed target was only 44,000 kVA. After the launch of the double-anti, double-comparison campaign in the city, the workers rose up, engaged in technical reforms, and continuously made leaps forward in production targets. Earlier this month, when the gongs and drums of a fraternal factory's competition initiative reached this factory, the workers were unwilling to fall behind and voluntarily held an emergency meeting on Sunday to tap the potential that could still be tapped in all aspects, and put forward a new goal: to guarantee the completion of 1,000,000 kVA for the whole year and strive to complete 1,200,000 kVA.

    Some people were worried that such high new targets could not be completed, saying that two-thirds of the year had already passed, and if the target of 1,000,000 kVA had been proposed at the beginning of the year, the possibility of completion would be greater. Others believed that completing the original target of 400,000 kVA was already tense enough, and had doubts about making such a high leap forward. However, the mood of the workers was extremely enthusiastic, with great confidence, engaging in technical reforms, and put forward many new suggestions for technological innovation, of which thirteen were more important, and some were new improvements to the original reforms. For example, bending the heat dissipation tubes of transformers was originally done manually by workers from other factories, which was both laborious and inefficient. Since the Great Leap Forward, the Dada Factory staff have used indigenous methods and scrap materials to make a pipe bending machine, reducing labor by half and increasing efficiency by more than one time. This time, they also proposed a new suggestion of "multi-pipe bending," planning to change the pipe bending machine from bending one pipe at a time to bending three pipes at a time, further increasing efficiency by two times. Another example is the newly modified shear car, and the staff proposed to further change it from motorized to semi-automatic to adapt to the new needs of the new leap forward.

    The office staff, who had always lagged far behind the workers, are now closely following. They have adjusted the division of labor, and half of the staff are concentrating their efforts on organizing and supplying raw materials and outsourced collaborative parts, running around outside all day, and holding a meeting every two days to grasp the progress of the work.

    Tool management personnel have also adopted a method of taking turns on duty at night to ensure the timely supply of equipment needed by workers for night production.

　　抓紧最后四个月  生产战线比英豪
    大达电机厂重新修订指标，变压器产量比去年跃增五十多倍
    本报上海22日电　在今年还剩下不到五个月的时候，上海公私合营大达电机厂最近又提出了跃进指标。这次再跃进，使今年变压器的产量指标由四十万千伏安跳到了一百万，比该厂去年增长五十多倍，大大超过上海全市去年变压器的总产量。
    大达厂是一个百余人的小厂。厂房是一个旧仓库，场地狭窄，办公室、宿舍和食堂搭在仓库的屋顶上。全厂除了十多台机床和几台工人自己改装的绕线车以外，很多是手工操作。这次一百万千伏安的指标，是这个厂今年以来的第五次跃进。去年，这个厂只生产了变压器一万八千多千伏安；今年年初时提出的今年指标，也只有四万四千千伏安。全市双反双比运动展开以后，工人群众起来了，大搞技术改革，生产指标不断跃进。本月上旬，兄弟厂提出竞赛倡议的锣鼓敲到这个厂，工人们不甘落后，在星期日自动召开紧急会议，挖掘各方面还可能挖出的潜力，提出了新的目标：全年保证完成一百万，力争完成一百二十万千伏安。
    有人担心这样高的新指标完不成，说一年已经过了三分之二，要是在年初时提出一百万的指标，完成的可能性还大些。也有人认为完成原来四十万的指标已够紧张的了，对再跃进这么高有怀疑。但是，工人群众的情绪却异常热烈，信心很大，大搞技术改革，提出了很多革新技术的新建议，其中比较重要的就有十三项，有些是原来做了改革的又作了新的改进。譬如弯制变压器的散热管，原来是由外厂工人用手工来扳的，既很吃力，效率又低，大跃进以来，大达厂职工用土办法和废旧料制成了一台弯管机，人工减少一半，效率提高一倍多，这次他们又提出了“弯管多根化”的新建议，计划把弯管机由一次弯一根管子改为一次弯三根，再提高效率两倍。又如刚刚改装完成的剪刀车，职工又提出由机动进一步改为半自动化，以适应新跃进的新需要。
    一向远远落在工人群众后面的科室人员，现在也紧紧跟上来了。他们调整了分工，半数人员都集中力量作原材料和外包协作件的组织供应工作，成天在外面奔跑，并且两天开一次碰头会，掌握工作进展情况。
    工具管理人员也采取了夜里轮流值班的办法，保证工人夜间生产需要器材的及时供应。
