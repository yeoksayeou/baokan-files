　　Century-Old Factory Rejuvenated
　　By Our Reporter Gao Jie
    On August 25th, the "Peace 28", a 5,000-ton freighter newly built by the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard, was completed ahead of schedule. The construction of this freighter took only five months and 12 days, shortening the planned time by more than two-thirds. Its miraculous construction speed and unusual construction experience have caused a sensation in Shanghai's industrial circles, becoming a red flag in the great leap forward of Shanghai factories.
    The Jiangnan Shipyard is one of the earliest shipyards established in China, with a history of ninety-three years. It has always been known throughout the country for its "old age" and "size." During the Two-Anti Movement, the China Mineral Raw Materials Factory, with only eighty-three employees, came to the Jiangnan Factory with gongs and drums to challenge them, which stirred the hearts of the workers. The factory posted 530,000 big-character posters proposing to "shorten the ship repair and construction cycle!" During this period, the Party committee and administrative leaders carried out major rectification and reforms, putting forward the general slogan of "Everything for shortening the ship repair and construction cycle!" to all factory workers, which immediately mobilized the enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory.
    The "Peace 28" was put into production when this mass movement entered its climax.
    The Stimulus of Backwardness
    On March 14th, the day after this freighter began production, Shanghai held a city-wide workers' representative meeting. The Jiangnan Factory sent Liang Zhicai and Yan Chunhui, the heads of the two best production teams in the shipbuilding workshop, to attend the meeting. They came to the meeting excitedly, wanting to be the first to speak and tell everyone about the factory's great leap forward. However, after listening to the conference, wow! This factory was catching up with Britain, that factory was chasing Japan, and output was jumping several or even dozens of times. They thought, "If others are making such a leap forward, what do we amount to!" Neither of them was prepared to speak.
    When they returned to the factory, they went to see Zhou Zhifa, the secretary of the Party branch in the workshop. Before Zhou could speak, Liang Zhicai said, "Old Zhou, we're lagging behind again!" Then, he told the situation of the conference in detail and asked that the 5,000-ton freighter be launched one month earlier to celebrate the Party's birthday on July 1st. The branch secretary listened and immediately said to them: "Let's have a meeting tonight to discuss it."
    The meeting that night was very tense, and all the section chiefs and team leaders in the workshop were present. Liang Zhicai and Yan Chunhui first talked about the situation of the conference, which immediately ignited everyone's emotions like a fire. Liang Zhicai first proposed that the workers do the lofting and blanking themselves, and they guaranteed that the blanking time would be reduced from two months to one month; Yan Chunhui's team was in charge of hull assembly, and he also said that launching in three and a half months was no problem. The two sections at the beginning and end expressed their attitudes. Only Gong Yinfa, the head of the mechanical processing section, sat aside without saying a word. Ji Guilian, the head of the assembly section, became anxious. He stood up and patted Gong Yinfa on the chest, saying, "As long as the mechanical processing section supplies the processed steel plates in time, we guarantee launching in three and a half months. Old Gong, what do you say?" Gong Yinfa had been calculating since the beginning of the meeting, but he couldn't make up his mind. According to the usual practice, the processing work for such a large ship would take four months, at least one and a half to two months. Moreover, sixteen flame cutting workers had been transferred away, and there were not enough semi-automatic flame cutting machines. If he didn't make a leap forward, wouldn't he be holding others back? … He hesitated and talked about some difficulties, and finally only said "do my best."
    Early the next morning, Master Gong came to the workshop. He gathered the workers together and talked about the meeting last night, the current tasks and difficulties. Before he could finish his words, some workers shouted, "What? We have become the key to the leap forward! Section chief, don't worry, boldly accept the task. Loft as much as you want, we will process as much as you want." Gong Yinfa was still half-believing, but the workers had already started working. The original two shifts were changed to three shifts; if there were not enough tools or manpower, the workers would engage in technical innovation. Foreman Zhao Guifu thought hard all night, and the next day he worked with everyone to study how to modify the automatic flame cutting torch from one head to four heads, which increased the work efficiency by three times.
    This is how methods and wisdom were forced out. The task that originally took forty-five days to complete was now completed in seven days.
    On June 19th, the 5,000-ton freighter "Peace 28" and the "Jiangyang" and "Jiangdu" and other four ships were launched simultaneously, taking advantage of the high tide of the Huangpu River. The 5,000-ton freighter was actually completed on June 17th, fourteen days ahead of schedule. The construction quality of the hull fully met the requirements, the cost was reduced by 17.6% compared to the plan, 9.78% of steel was saved, and 20.73% of working hours were saved.
    Those who stood on the shore to watch the tide and those who were skeptical about the launch had to admit defeat.
    Catching Up with Dalian
    After the hull was launched, the installation of the internal main engine, auxiliary engine, boiler and cabin decoration and other projects fell on the shoulders of the outfitting workshop workers. As early as two or three days before the launching, the outfitting workers had been brewing a decision to advance the delivery date from mid-December to the end of September, a leap forward of two and a half months. However, a few days later, the news came that the "Peace 25", a similar type of freighter from the Dalian Shipyard, would be delivered by August 15th, and would compete with the "Peace 28".
    The outfitting workers calculated that the delivery date would fall behind the Dalian factory, no way! They immediately decided to advance it by another month and a half, also delivering the ship in August.
    The plan was made, but there were many difficulties. When they proposed the delivery plan, the cabins were still empty, and nothing like the main engine, auxiliary engine, boiler, or thrust shaft had arrived. Moreover, according to the delivery date on the contract, they were all next year.
    According to the process regulations, the ship's main engine and boiler should be installed first, then the thrust shaft, then the center shaft, and then connected to the tail shaft (which had been installed before launching). At that time, at most the center shaft processed by the factory itself could be supplied in advance. If they waited for everything to arrive before installing, they would not be able to deliver the ship on August 15th.
    The Wu Xiankang team, which was responsible for this part of the installation, was a group of energetic young lads. They and the section chief Zhang Maoyin, who came from the old workers, studied for a long time and decided not to wait. They remembered that the factory's copper workers often used dummy shafts to replace bearings, and boldly proposed to reverse the process regulations: start from the stern of the ship, first install six intermediate shafts, replace the thrust shaft with a dummy model, and then measure and position the main engine and boiler to fix the position. This was a bold and clever idea.
    Smart workers are the ones who win the time for the leap forward.
    The Jiangnan Factory workers' daring communist style is also reflected in their spirit of cooperation with the Dalian Shipyard. The competition with the Dalian factory made them both happy and worried. What worried them was that they would fall behind the Dalian factory; what made them happy was that they could work with the Dalian factory to catch up with Britain and overtake Japan, and make a great leap forward in the entire Chinese shipbuilding industry. The engine-making workshop had to manufacture two hydraulic steering gears for its own "Peace 28" and the Dalian factory's "Peace 25". Dalian Factory was far away and had to be supplied early. They did not have enough time to manufacture them, so they decided to give the Dalian Factory the hydraulic steering gear from another Sichuan River wheel first. The two bearings of this hydraulic steering gear were not very good. At that time, the factory had four bearings, two better and two worse. The workers put the two better ones into the steering gear of the "Peace 25". They said: "We want to compare our drive with the Dalian factory, but also our spirit of cooperation. If our own is broken, we can repair it, but if Dalian's is broken, it will affect their leap forward."
    Created a New World
    Building a 5,000-ton freighter in five months is not just about a ship for the Jiangnan Shipyard. It brought a new life to this century-old factory, brought profound changes in various aspects of the factory's work, and created a new world.
    Party Secretary Comrade Huang Tao said: "The several major leaps forward of this ship were all forced out, the masses forced the leaders, and the bottom forced the top. This forcing has swept away all the rules and regulations in the factory that bound production in the past, and the old and conservative elements, bringing many new insights to the work of the enterprise."
    The Party secretary said: "The forcing is good. Our leaders must learn to be good at leading the masses to force the leaders. Once forced, it forces out high speed, forces out a great leap forward, and forces out a major turnaround of the entire enterprise. Every time we make a leap forward and encounter difficulties, it often seems that we have reached the end of the road, but once we mobilize the workers, we immediately reach a bright future."
    The workers of the Jiangnan Factory are not satisfied with such achievements. They said: "Farmers are producing 7,000 catties of wheat and 36,000 catties of rice, we are lagging behind again." We must build 10,000 tons, 20,000 tons... of big guys, one better than the other, and one faster than the other." In August, they have already proposed a great leap forward plan to launch twenty-seven ships one after another.

　　百年老厂复青春
　　本报记者　高洁
    8月25日，上海江南造船厂新造的载重量五千吨海轮“和平28号”提前完工了。这艘海轮的建造时间只有五个月零12天，比计划时间缩短三分之二以上。它因神奇的建造速度和不平常的建设经历轰动了上海工业界，成为上海工厂大跃进中的一面红旗。
    江南造船厂是我国建立得最早的一个造船厂，到现在已有九十三年历史。向来以它的“老”和“大”闻名于全国。双反运动中，只有八十三名职工的中国矿产原料厂，敲锣打鼓到江南厂来挑战，激动了职工们的心。全厂五十三万张大字报提出要“缩短修、造船周期！”党委和行政领导在这期间进行了大整大改，向全厂职工提出“一切为了缩短修、造船周期！”的总口号，立即把全厂职工的积极性都调动起来。
    “和平28号”就是在这个群众运动进入高潮的时候开始投料生产的。
    落后的刺激
    3月14日，当这艘海轮开始投料生产的第二天，上海召开全市工人代表会议，江南厂选派了造船车间两个生产最优秀的小组组长梁之才和严纯辉去参加大会。他们两人兴冲冲地来到会场，想抢先发言，把厂里大跃进情况痛痛快快讲一番。可是，在大会上一听，嗬！人家这个厂赶英国，那个厂追日本，产量都是几倍、十几倍地往上跳。心想：“人家这样跃进，我们算得了什么！”两人都不准备发言了。
    两人回到厂里，就去找车间党总支书记周志发。没有等周开口，梁之才就说：“老周，我们又落后啦！”接着，便把大会的情况一五一十地讲了出来，并且要求把五千吨海轮再提前一个月下水，向“七一”党的生日献礼。总支书记听了，马上对他们说：“今晚就开个会研究研究。” 
    这天晚上的会开得很紧张，车间里所有的工段长、小组长都到齐了。梁之才和严纯辉先把大会的情况讲了一下，立即像一把火把大家的情绪燃烧起来。梁之才首先提出由工人自己放样下料，他们保证把下料时间再由两个月压缩为一个月；严纯辉小组管船体装配，也说三个半月下水没问题。一头一尾两个工段都表示了态度。独有机械加工工段长龚银富坐在一边不吭声。装配工段长纪桂连急了，他站起来对龚银富拍拍胸脯说：“只要机械加工工段及时供应加工好的钢板，我们保证三个半月下水。老龚，怎么样？”龚银富从会议一开始就在盘算，但算来算去下不了决心。这样大一条船的加工工作，照常规要四个月，起码是一个半月到两个月。何况，又有十六个风割工被抽走，还缺少半自动风割机。不跃进吗？岂不是拖了人家的后腿。……他支支吾吾地谈了一些困难，最后只说了个“尽最大力量去做”。
    第二天清早，龚师傅来到车间，他把工人找到一起，把昨晚开会的情况，当前的任务和困难讲了讲。谁知，他的话还没有说完，有些工人就嚷开了：“怎么？我们成了跃进的关键啦！工段长，你放心，大胆把任务接下来。放样放多少，我们加工多少。”龚银富还在半信半疑，工人已经干起来了。原来两班生产的，改为三班；工具不够，人手不够，工人就大搞技术革新。工长赵桂福苦想了一夜，第二天就同大家一起研究，把自动风割刀从一个头子改装为四个头子，工作效率提高了三倍。
    办法和智慧就是这样给逼了出来。原来要四十五天完成的任务，现在七天就完成了。
    6月19日，五千吨海轮“和平28号”和“江阳”、“江都”等共四条船乘着黄浦江高涨的午潮，同时下水了。五千吨海轮其实在6月17日就已经完工，比原定计划提前了十四天。船体的建造质量完全合乎要求，成本比计划降低17.6％，节约钢材9.78％，节约工时20.73％。
    站在岸边观潮的人，对下水抱怀疑的人，只好服输了。
    赶大连
    船体下水以后，内部的主机、副机、锅炉的安装和舱室装修等工程落到了舾装车间工人的肩上。早在下水前两三天，舾装工人就酝酿决定把交船期从12月中旬提前到9月底，跃进两个半月。可是，没有几天，消息传来，大连造船厂同样类型的“和平25号”海轮要提前到8月15日交船，要和“和平28号”展开竞赛。
    舾装工人一算，交船期要落在大连厂后面了，不行！立即决定再提前一个半月，也在8月内交船。
    计划是订出来了，困难确是不少。当他们提出交船计划的时候，船舱里还是空空洞洞，主机、副机、锅炉、推力轴等，一样都没有来。而且，按照合同上的交货日期，都是明年。
    按照工艺规程，应当是首先安装船的主机和锅炉，然后装推力轴、然后中心轴、再接上尾轴（下水前已装好）。当时，顶多是厂里自己加工的中心轴可以提前供应。如果等齐了再装，就不能在8月15日交船。
    负责这部分安装的邬显康小组，是一群干劲冲天的年青小伙子。他们和老工人出身的工段长张毛银一起研究了好久，决定不能等。他们想起厂里铜工制造轴承经常用假轴代替，大胆提出把工艺规程来个大反转：从船尾做起，先装六根中间轴，推力轴用假的模型代替，主机与锅炉则先进行测量定位，把位置固定下来。这是一个大胆而又聪明的设想。
    聪明的工人，就是这样地赢得了跃进的时间。
    江南厂工人的这种敢作敢为的共产主义风格，还表现在和大连造船厂的协作精神上。跟大连厂的一场竞赛，使他们又是高兴又是担心。担心的是怕自己落在大连厂后面；高兴的是可以和大连厂一起赶英国、压日本，使整个中国造船工业来个大跃进。造机车间要为自己厂的“和平28号”和大连厂的“和平25号”制造两部油压舵机。大连厂远，须提早供应，来不及制造，他们决定把另一条川江轮上的油压舵机先给大连。这部油压舵机有两个轴承不大好，当时厂里有四个轴承，两个好些，两个差些。工人就把两个好的装进“和平25号”的舵机中去。并且说：“我们和大连厂比干劲，还要比协作精神。自己的坏了可以修，大连的坏了就会影响他们跃进。”
    创出了新天下
    五个月造成一条载重量五千吨的大海轮，对江南造船厂的意义，绝不只是一条船。它带来了这家百年老厂的新生，带来这个厂各方面工作深刻的变化，创出了新天下。
    党委书记黄涛同志说：“这条船的几次大跃进都是逼出来的，群众逼领导，下面逼上面。这一逼，把过去厂里的许许多多束缚生产的规章制度，老大、保守全都冲刷得干干净净，给企业工作带来很多新的启示。”
    党委书记说：“逼得好，我们领导就是要学会善于领导群众逼领导，一逼，就逼出了高速度，逼出了大跃进，逼出了整个企业的大翻身。每当我们跃进一次，遇到了困难，往往看来是山穷水尽了，可是一经发动工人，却又立即到了柳暗花明的境地。”
    江南厂的工人们没有满足于这样的成绩。他们说：“农民小麦七千斤，水稻三万六，我们又落后了。” 我们还要造一万吨、两万吨……的大家伙，一条比一条好，一条比一条快。”8月份，他们已经提出来要使二十七条船先后下水的大跃进计划。
