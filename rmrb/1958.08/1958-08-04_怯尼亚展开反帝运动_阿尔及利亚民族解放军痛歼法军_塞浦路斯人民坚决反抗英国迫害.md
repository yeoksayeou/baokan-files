Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 3rd - George Sida, Foreign Affairs Secretary of the African Association of Nairobi, Kenya, said here today that a powerful anti-imperialist movement is unfolding in Kenya, which is giving Britain a heavy blow.

Sida pointed out that the anti-imperialist movement in Kenya is being carried out secretly. The Mau Mau nationalist movement in Kenya began several years ago, and later went underground due to British suppression.

Sida, who recently arrived in Cairo, called on Arabs to support Kenya's struggle for freedom and the movement of the African people. He said that Kenya will soon set up an office in Cairo to let the world know about the just struggle of the Kenyan people.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - Algiers News: Yesterday, the Algerian National Liberation Army successfully ambushed a French colonial army convoy near Afreville. According to the French army's figures, which are usually greatly reduced, ten French soldiers were killed and two others were missing. On the same day, fighting also took place in the Bogasaada area.

On July 30, the Algerian National Liberation Army heavily attacked the French army in a stronghold 150 miles south of Algiers, in the mountainous area east of Algiers, and in many other areas. In this day's battle, more than 50 French colonial soldiers were killed.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - Nicosia News: The "Organization for Struggle for Cyprus" warned the British authorities yesterday that if the colonial authorities do not stop their persecution and suppression measures, Cypriot patriots will "persist in fighting to the last person to defend themselves."

The "Organization for Struggle for Cyprus" distributed leaflets in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, condemning the British colonial army's collusion with Turkish thugs on the island, and their indiscriminate brutality against peaceful Cypriot residents. The leaflet pointed out that British Prime Minister Macmillan's call for Cypriots to stop violent actions was simply "nonsense."

Britain is still trying to maintain its colonial rule over Cyprus by using both threats and military suppression. Yesterday, the colonial authorities sent planes to distribute 500,000 leaflets printed with Macmillan's appeal to towns and villages across the island. On the same morning, the British army launched its largest offensive this year in the eastern region of Cyprus. In the past two months, the movement against British colonial rule in this region has been particularly vigorous.

    怯尼亚展开反帝运动
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军痛歼法军
    塞浦路斯人民坚决反抗英国迫害
    新华社开罗3日电　怯尼亚内罗毕的非洲人协会的外事秘书乔治·西达今天在这里说，在怯尼亚正在展开强大的反对帝国主义的运动，这个运动正给英国以沉重的打击。
    西达指出，怯尼亚的反帝运动是秘密进行的。怯尼亚的茅茅民族主义运动在若干年前，就展开了，后来由于英国的镇压转入了地下。
    西达是在最近来到开罗的，他呼吁阿拉伯人支持怯尼亚争取自由的斗争和非洲人民的运动。他说，怯尼亚不久即将在开罗设办事处，要全世界了解怯尼亚人民的正义斗争。
    据新华社3日讯　阿尔及尔消息：昨天阿尔及利亚民族解放军在阿弗雷维尔附近成功地伏击了法国殖民军的一支护车队，据法军方面通常大大缩减的数字，法军死亡十人，另外还有两个人失踪。同一天，在博加萨达地区也发生了战斗。
    7月30日在阿尔及尔以南一百五十英里的一个据点和阿尔及尔以东的山区及许多地区，阿尔及利亚民族解放军又痛击法军。在这一天的战斗中，法国殖民军有五十多人被击毙。
    新华社3日讯　尼科西亚消息：“为塞浦路斯而斗争组织”昨天警告英国当局说，如果殖民当局不停止迫害和镇压措施，塞浦路斯的爱国者就要“为保卫自己而坚持斗争到最后一个人”。
    “为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织在塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚散发传单，谴责英国殖民军同岛上的土耳其暴徒互相勾结，对塞浦路斯和平居民滥施残暴。传单指出，英国首相麦克米伦反而呼吁塞浦路斯人停止暴力行动，这简直是“胡言乱语”。
    英国仍然企图用威胁和军事镇压并施的方法来维持它对塞浦路斯的殖民统治。殖民当局昨天派飞机向这个岛的各个市镇和乡村散发了印有麦克米伦的呼吁的五十万份传单。就在同一天清晨，英国军队在塞浦路斯东部地区发动了今年以来规模最巨大的进攻。在过去两个月中，这个地区反抗英国殖民统治的运动特别蓬勃。
