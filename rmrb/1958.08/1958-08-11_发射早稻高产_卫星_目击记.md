　　Eyewitness Account of Launching a High-Yield Early Rice "Satellite"

　　Upon arriving at the Gaofeng Commune in Zongyang County, Anhui Province, we were strongly infected by the atmosphere of celebrating a great event. In a small village, many cars were parked, and commune members greeted visitors from afar with smiling faces. Among the guests were people from Shanghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, Liaoning, and various parts of Anhui Province. The high-yield early rice experimental field of this commune was about to be harvested. Both hosts and guests were filled with joy, anticipation, and excitement, eager to see just how big this high-yield early rice "satellite" would be.
　　When we walked to this "satellite" field, we couldn't help but exclaim: "Wow, such a well-grown field of rice!" This field was rectangular, covering one mu, four li, and two hao. The rice growing in the field looked like a stacked rice threshing ground, more than two chi thick, with some places exceeding three chi. At a glance, the field was covered with a golden carpet of rice ears, densely packed, with very few leaves visible because they were pressed beneath the rice ears. We used our hands to part the surface layer of rice ears and saw layers upon layers like flattened rice ears. One comrade inserted his hand and exclaimed with surprise: "Ah, it feels like inserting it into a rice basket!" We randomly picked a few rice ears and counted them. The most had 340 grains, one had 297 grains, and the least had 206 grains. This field used a 2x3 cun close planting method, with about 110,000 rice plants per mu, totaling 2.4 million ears. Pulling up a rice plant, we saw that the leaves were four to five fen wide, and the rice stalks were very strong, as thick as chopsticks. The rice stalks were almost touching each other, densely packed together, leaning at an angle of about forty degrees. A commune member told us:
　　"Before heading and ripening, each rice plant stood straight, about as tall as a person of average height. After heading and grain filling, the rice ears drooped heavily, bending the stalks, and gradually turned into what you see now." The commune member added: "The rice plants didn't lodge, one reason being the close planting. With each stalk close to the next, it's impossible to lodge." At this time, many visitors were engaged in various activities by the field: agricultural scientists were collecting specimens, and photographers and cameramen were looking for extraordinary rice ears. Comrades from visiting groups from Shanghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places wanted to dig out a square chi of whole rice plants from the middle of the field for scientific research. However, they couldn't walk into the field, so they dug out two patches at the corners of the field. Observing this early rice field in detail, we remembered that a few days ago, a commune member in an agricultural commune described their early rice as: "Our early rice grows so densely that even if you put an egg on the rice surface, it won't roll off." Now, after seeing this field of early rice, we can say without exaggeration: on this field with two or three chi thick of flattened rice, even if you put a watermelon on it, it wouldn't fall to the ground.
　　The commune members harvesting this early rice field, regardless of old or young, had no experience. On the morning of July 7th, the commune mobilized more than sixty people to harvest. From eleven o'clock when they started cutting, they only harvested a little more than a chi wide by twelve o'clock. Min Chuanrong, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, saw that there weren't enough people in the field and shouted anxiously: "Why are only these few people carrying the rice? Quickly increase the number of people." Later, the number was increased to more than three hundred people. From two o'clock in the afternoon, they began cutting, threshing, and transporting, and after exposure to the sun, it was weighed. This continued until six-thirty in the afternoon, when all the early rice was cut. After the first threshing, the grains on the rice stalks were still not completely threshed. The next day, they threshed for more than half a day, and finally finished at four o'clock in the afternoon. When harvesting the rice, the field was full of people, with fifteen rice buckets placed there. The people in front cut the rice, and the people behind picked it up and threshed it, while others transported the rice stalks and grains away. Because the rice was dense and strong, cutting and threshing were very laborious, and they had to change sickles frequently. One commune member said: "It's really strange. This year, harvesting rice is like encountering immortals. The more you cut, the more there is. In previous years, it only took three to five people a day to harvest and thresh one mu of rice, but this year, more than three hundred people can't handle it."
　　The commune members were all beaming with joy while harvesting the rice. The girls wore colorful clothes to cut the rice, and the district party secretary shouted loudly through a loudspeaker by the field: "Keep it up! Keep it up!" Cheers and laughter constantly erupted from the rice field. Many people asked every now and then: "How much has been threshed?" Commune member Tang Qingsheng originally didn't believe that this field could reach the target of 5,000 jin per mu. He also participated in the harvesting that day, and he constantly asked the township and commune cadres how much had been threshed. When less than half had been harvested, it was said that several thousand jin had already been threshed. He was convinced and said: "Really so much? My thinking is too conservative!" Not only were the commune members all elated; the visitors were also immersed in the joy of the harvest. Although the sun was scorching and the heat was oppressive, the comrades participating in the harvesting and threshing were still very seriously busy measuring the field, supervising the harvest, supervising the threshing, supervising the transportation, and weighing. We went to the place where the weighing team was working and saw two abacuses on the table. A comrade was sweating profusely while weighing, and two comrades were simultaneously calculating with the abacus, the work was being carried out in an orderly manner.
　　During the harvesting and threshing process, the most tense moment was the afternoon of the 8th. At this time, everyone was eager to know the final confirmed yield. The place for weighing was crowded with people, and many eyes were fixed on the two abacuses. "14,000," "15,000," "16,000," as the yield increased, people's emotions rose like a tide.
　　The celebration began. When the calculation team announced that the final calculated yield was 16,227 jin and 13 liang per mu, the whole place erupted, with the sounds of gongs and drums, firecrackers, cheers, and applause all blending together. A commune member carried a huge red flag and climbed to the top of a rice pile that looked like a small mountain, and at this time the photographer captured this moving scene. At the celebration, many heads of visiting groups gave congratulatory speeches and presented flags. They cheered for this great victory and congratulated this great victory.

　　发射早稻高产“卫星”目击记
　　冒茀君　石正章　檀英和
    到了安徽省枞阳县高丰社以后，一股办喜事的气氛强烈地感染着我们。在一个不大的庄子里，停放着许多汽车、社员们笑容满面地接待远方的来客。客人中有上海来的，有四川来的，有贵州来的，有辽宁来的，也有从安徽省各地来的。这个社的一块早稻丰产试验田就要收割了。不论主人和客人，个个都怀着喜悦期待而又激动的心情，要看这颗早稻高产“卫星”究竟有多大。
    当我们走到这块“卫星”田的时候，都禁不住惊叫起来：“好家伙，长得这么好的一块稻！”这块田呈长方形，共一亩零四厘二毫，田里长的稻子就像堆的稻场似的，足足有二尺多厚，最厚的地方有三尺以上，一眼望去，田面上铺着一片金黄色的稻穗，挤得满满的，很少看见叶子，因为叶子都压到稻穗底下去了。我们用手拨开表面的一层稻穗，看到下面还有一层一层像平铺的稻穗。有个同志用手插进去，惊喜地说：“啊呀，好像插在稻箩里了。”我们又随手摘下几个稻穗数了一下，最多一穗是三百四十粒，一穗是二百九十七粒，最少的一穗是二百零六粒。这块田是采用2×3寸密植的，每亩约有十一万蔸，二百四十万穗。用力拔起一株稻来看，叶子有四五分宽，稻秆非常坚硬，有筷子那样粗。稻秆几乎一根挨着一根，密密的挤在一起了，约成四十多度的角度一边倾斜着。一个社员告诉我们说：
  “在抽穗成熟以前，每株稻都笔直的立着，约有中等身材的人一般高。抽穗灌浆以后，稻穗沉沉下垂，压弯了腰，就渐渐变成现在这个样子了。”这位社员又说：“稻株没有倒伏，栽得密是原因之一，一根紧靠一根，要倒伏也倒不下来。”这时很多参观的人在田边进行各种各样的活动：农业科学工作者正在采集标本，摄影记者和摄影师正在寻找异乎寻常的稻穗。上海、四川、贵州等地参观团的同志，想从田中间挖出一平方尺全蔸水稻，进行科学研究。可是他们没有办法走进田去，只好在田两角挖了两块。我们详细地观察这块早稻，想起前几天在一个农业社里，有个社员曾经形容他们的早稻说：“我们的早稻长得连一个鸡蛋放在稻面上也滚不下去。”现在看了这块田早稻以后，我们可以毫不夸大的说：在这块田平铺着的两三尺厚的稻面上，就是放上个西瓜也不会掉下地去。
    收割这块早稻田的社员，不管老年人和青年人都没有经验。7日上午，社里动员六十多人来收割，从十一时开镰，到十二时只割了一尺多宽。中共安徽省委书记閔传荣在田里看到人不够，急的直喊：“怎么只来这几个人挑稻呀，赶快增加人。”后来增加到三百多人，从下午二时起边割、边打、边运，经过曝晒以后过秤。这样一直干到下午六点半钟，才将这块早稻全部割完。初打一遍，但稻秸上的稻粒仍未打净，第二天又打了半天多，直到下午四点才最后打完。割稻的时候，田里站满了人，放着十五个禾桶，前面的人把稻割下，后面的人随着拿起就打，一面打，一面就有人把稻秸和稻谷运走。因为稻子又密又壮，割打都十分费力，割一会就要另换镰刀。一个社员说：“真是怪事，今年割稻真是遇仙了，越割越多。往年收打一亩田稻，三五个人一天就行了，今年三百多人一天还对付不了。”
    社员们在割稻的时候，人人喜气洋洋，个个眉开颜笑。姑娘们穿着花衣服来割稻，区委书记用喇叭在田边高声喊着：“加油啊！加油啊！”稻田里不断地发出一片欢呼声和笑声。许多人过一会就问：“已经打多少了？”社员唐庆胜原来不相信这块田能达到五千斤的指标。这天他也参加收割，他不断的问乡社干部已经打了多少。当收了还没有一半，据说已经打到几千斤的时候，他服气了，他说：“真的打这么多啊，我的思想太保守了！”不但社员人人兴高采烈；参观的人也都浸沉在丰收的喜悦中。虽然赤日炎炎，暑气迫人，但参加边收边打的同志仍然非常认真的忙着量田、监收、监打、监运、过秤。我们走到过秤小组工作的地方，看到桌上放着两把算盘。一个同志满头大汗正在掌秤，两个同志同时用算盘计算，工作井井有条。
    在收打过程中，最紧张的时候是8日下午。这时每个人都急切的想知道最后定下来的产量。过秤的地方挤满了人，很多眼睛注视着两把算盘。“一万四了”，“一万五了”，“一万六了”，随着产量的增加，人们的情绪就像潮水一样不断的高涨着。
    庆祝会开始了，当计算小组公布最后计算出来的产量是亩产一万六千二百二十七斤十三两的时候，全场都沸腾起来了，锣鼓声鞭炮声欢呼声鼓掌声响成一片。一个社员扛着一面巨大的红旗，爬上一座像小山的稻堆顶，这时摄影师把这一个动人的镜头拍摄下来。庆祝会上，很多参观团的负责人致贺词、献旗，他们欢呼这个伟大的胜利，祝贺这个伟大的胜利。
