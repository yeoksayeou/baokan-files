　　Digging Up Bricks
　　Master Sun Dechang, stripped to the waist, with beads of sweat the size of soybeans trickling down, hunched over on the ground, using his clumsy wood-chopping knife to dig up the firebricks. After a short while, all three hundred and twenty firebricks on the floor of the house were dug up. He wiped each brick until it was spotless. Then, he piled the bricks into a small stack resembling a water well. Only after he had laid the last brick did he straighten up, looking at the firebricks. He seemed to be saying: Bricks, oh bricks, I really can't bear to part with you!
　　Master Sun's love for the firebricks had a story behind it. His home consisted of only one room, half for eating and half for sleeping. The floor was a layer of dark, muddy ground, very damp. On cloudy or rainy days, it was practically a muddy road. One step, and your shoe would be covered in a thick layer of mud. "If only we could lay a layer of bricks on the floor, that would be wonderful!" Master Sun had dreamed this for decades, but had been disappointed for decades as well. Only in this golden, shining era did Master Sun's muddy floor become covered with a layer of greenish-yellow bricks. The night the bricks were laid, he and his wife stayed awake until dawn. The next day, when the neighbors came to congratulate them, Master Sun looked at his legs, swollen like winter melons, and felt a pang of sadness. As time passed, this bitter sadness faded from Master Sun's mind. But this afternoon, at the workshop meeting, the workshop director said: "Everyone knows the factory is going to build fifty-eight small blast furnaces, but we're late, and all the firebricks have been taken. We must build the blast furnaces, but what if we don't have firebricks? Let's all contribute our treasures!..." These words immediately brought back Master Sun's past, but he didn't feel sad; he just thought, "Let's endure it for now, there will be plenty of bricks in the future!" So he hurried home and dug up the bricks in his house.

　　挖砖
    孙得昌师傅赤着膊，淌着豆粒大的汗珠子伛在地上，用那把笨拙柴刀挖地上的火砖。一阵子工夫，这间房子地上三百二十块火砖全挖起来了。他把火砖都揩得净光净光。接着把砖头堆成一口水井样的小堆子。他砌好最后一块砖，才直起身来，望着火砖。他仿佛是说：砖呵砖，我真舍不得你呀！
    孙师傅对火砖这么心爱，是有一番由来的。他的家只有一间房子，一半吃饭，一半睡人。地下是一层黑糊糊的泥地，潮湿得很。一到阴天或是雨天，简直就像条黄泥路。一脚踩下去，鞋底就粘着一层厚厚的烂泥。“要是在地上铺上一层砖头，那可多好呢！”孙师傅梦想了几十年，可也失望了几十年。只有在我们这个金光闪耀的时代里，孙师傅家里的烂泥地上，才铺成了一层青黄的砖头。砖头铺好的那个晚上，他跟老伴一夜翻到天亮。第二天隔壁邻居来庆贺，孙师傅一瞧自己肿得像冬瓜一样的脚腿，就是一阵难受。随着时间的流逝，这种辛酸的难受，在孙师傅的心里抹去了。可是今天下午开车间大会，车间主任说：“大家都晓得厂里要办五十八个小高炉，可咱们迟了一步，火砖全给人家搞光了。高炉一定要搞，火砖没有怎么办？大家来献宝吧！……。”这几句话，一下子就把孙师傅的往事勾引起了，可是他没有难受的感觉，只是想：“暂时熬一下吧，将来砖头有的是！”于是便急颠颠地回家，把屋里的砖头挖起来了。
