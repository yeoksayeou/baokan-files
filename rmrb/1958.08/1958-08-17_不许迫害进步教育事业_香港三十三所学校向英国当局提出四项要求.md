Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 14th: Thirty-three schools in Hong Kong, represented by their principals and responsible persons, issued an important statement yesterday regarding the unreasonable persecution of Pui Kiu Middle School, presenting four demands to the British authorities in Hong Kong.

These demands are: 1. The Hong Kong British authorities must guarantee that there will be no further persecution of patriotic schools and patriotic educators. 2. The Hong Kong British authorities must guarantee respect for the right of Chinese people to run schools in Hong Kong, and the right to conduct patriotic education and patriotic activities in schools. 3. The Hong Kong British authorities must abolish articles in the education regulations that could create pretexts for persecuting our patriotic education cause, as well as other unreasonable articles. 4. The Hong Kong British authorities must order the Education Department to remove textbooks published by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Hong Kong US-Chiang secret service from the approved book list, and replace them with textbooks that are factually correct and suitable for students' needs.

The statement said: Since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong British authorities have carried out a series of persecutions against the educational endeavors of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and patriotic educators. These unreasonable measures, which violate human rights and damage the rights of the Chinese people to run schools in Hong Kong, are intolerable to us Chinese people. The Hong Kong authorities' persecution tactics, such as forcibly deporting Principal Du Boqui, will never intimidate us. We have gained more and stronger support from all sectors of society. We will always adhere to the policy of carrying out patriotic education, overcome obstacles, and continue to strive for the development of patriotic education.

　　不许迫害进步教育事业
　　香港三十三所学校向英国当局提出四项要求
    新华社香港14日电　香港三十三所学校的校长和负责人昨天就培侨中学遭受无理迫害的事件发表重要声明，向香港英国当局提出四项要求。
    这些要求是：一、香港英国当局必须保证今后不再有迫害爱国学校和爱国教育工作者的事情发生。二、香港英国当局必须保证尊重中国人民在香港办学的权利和在学校里进行爱国教育和爱国活动的权利。三、香港英国当局必须废弃教育法例中可以造成迫害我爱国教育事业的借口的条文和其他不合理的条文。四、香港英国当局必须着令教育司在核准书目中把台湾蒋介石集团和香港美蒋特务机关出版的教科书加以取消而代之以内容正确的适合学生需要的教科书。
    声明说：香港英国当局今年以来对香港中国人民的教育事业和爱国教育工作者进行了一连串的迫害，这些侵犯人权和损害中国人民在香港办学权利的无理措施都是我们中国人民所不能容忍的。香港当局采取强解杜伯奎校长出境的迫害手段，决不能把我们吓倒，我们已获得社会各界人士更多的更有力的支持，我们将永远坚持进行爱国主义教育的方针，排除障碍，继续为发展爱国教育事业而奋斗。
