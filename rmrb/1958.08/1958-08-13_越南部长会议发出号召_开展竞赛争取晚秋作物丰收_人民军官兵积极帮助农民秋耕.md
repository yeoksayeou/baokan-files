Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 13th: The public communiqué issued by the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 11th especially emphasized mobilizing the people to be "determined to strive for a bumper late autumn harvest."

　　This meeting was held in early August and was presided over by President Ho Chi Minh.

　　The Council of Ministers believes that striving for a bumper late autumn harvest this year is of extreme importance both economically and politically. Therefore, leadership must be strengthened, the agricultural production competition movement must be further promoted, the sown area targets in local plans must be completed and exceeded, special attention must be paid to increasing yield per unit area, and importance must be attached to planting coarse grains, drought resistance, flood prevention, wind prevention, and pest control. The communiqué pointed out that each of the above tasks must be combined with the work of consolidating and developing rural mutual aid teams and cooperatives.

　　The communiqué stated that in order to encourage farmers to step up their efforts in agricultural production, grain production, and the competition to strive for a bumper late autumn harvest, the Council of Ministers has decided that yield measurement work should be carried out immediately in places where conditions permit, in order to facilitate the calculation of agricultural taxes.

　　The communiqué stated that all localities must strengthen propaganda work and ideological education work, so that the production competition movement truly becomes a widespread, vigorous, and continuous mass movement to strive for a bumper late harvest. Other departments must also vigorously launch competition movements to realize national plans, strengthen organization and discipline, improve technology, stipulate responsibility systems, correctly implement reward and punishment systems, and at the same time prevent and promptly punish saboteurs.

　　The communiqué pointed out that the implementation of the national plan in the first half of this year has made significant progress compared with the same period last year, which shows that the various plan targets are appropriate.

　　Based on the above instructions of the Council of Ministers, governments at all levels in Vietnam are now concentrating their efforts on realizing the task of "being determined to strive for a bumper late autumn harvest."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: In the past two months, many officers and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army units have been engaged in production labor with the broad masses of farmers, and they have used more than 20,000 workdays to assist farmers in autumn plowing.

　　Wherever there is a drought, the officers and soldiers go there to dig canals and wells; wherever there is a need for flood prevention, they go there to repair dikes and dams.

　　The People's Army in many provinces have organized "Socialist Labor Days." On this day, they work hard with the farmers to ensure the realization of the slogan "Everyone plows in autumn, a bumper harvest in the late season." In order to strive for a bumper year, they sometimes have to go dozens of kilometers away to help farmers fight drought and eliminate insects. The farmers say that they truly deserve to be called the people's army, a great army of production.

　　越南部长会议发出号召
　　开展竞赛争取晚秋作物丰收
　　人民军官兵积极帮助农民秋耕
    据新华社河内13日电　越南民主共和国政府11日发表的部长会议公报，特别强调动员人民“决心争取晚秋作物丰收”。
    这次会议是在8月上旬举行的，会议由胡志明主席主持。
    部长会议认为，争取今年晚秋作物丰收，在经济上和政治上都具有极其重要的意义。因此，必须加强领导，进一步促进农业生产竞赛运动的开展，必须完成和超额完成各地计划中的播种面积的指标，必须特别重视提高单位面积产量，必须重视种植杂粮、抗旱、防汛、防风和除虫等工作。公报指出，上述每项工作必须同巩固和发展农村的变工组和合作社的工作结合起来。
    公报说，为了鼓励农民加紧努力进行农业生产、粮食生产和开展争取晚秋作物丰收的竞赛，部长会议决定，在条件具备的地方，应立即进行测定产量的工作，以便于计算农业税。
    公报说，各地方必须加强宣传工作和思想教育工作，使生产竞赛运动真正成为一个争取晚造丰收的广泛的、蓬勃的和连续的群众性运动。其他各部门也必须大力展开实现国家计划的竞赛运动，加强组织性和纪律性，改进技术，规定责任制，正确执行奖惩制度，同时防止和及时惩办破坏分子。
    公报指出，今年上半年国家计划执行情况比去年同期有了显著的进步，这表明各项计划指标是合适的。
    越南各级政权根据部长会议上述指示，现在正集中力量实现“决心争取晚秋作物丰收”的任务。
    据新华社河内11日电　两个月来越南人民军各单位的许多官兵同广大农民一起生产劳动，他们共用了两万多个劳动日来协助农民秋耕。
    哪里有旱灾，官兵们就开到哪里去挖渠挖井；哪里需要防洪防汛，他们就开到哪里去修堤筑坝。
    许多省份的人民军都组织了“社会主义劳动日”。他们在这一天同农民一起用辛勤的劳动来保证“全民秋耕，晚造丰收”口号的实现。为了争取一个丰收年，他们有时要到几十公里外的地方去协助农民抗旱除虫。农民说，他们真不愧是一支人民的军队，一支生产的大军。
