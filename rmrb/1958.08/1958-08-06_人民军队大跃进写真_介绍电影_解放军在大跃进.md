    A True Picture of the People's Army in the Great Leap Forward
    ——Introducing the Film "The People's Liberation Army in the Great Leap Forward"

    Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, the People's Liberation Army, together with the people of the whole country, has created thousands of miracles with soaring revolutionary zeal. The documentary "The People's Liberation Army in the Great Leap Forward" truly reflects the spirit of the People's Liberation Army during the Great Leap Forward, reflecting the unparalleled enthusiasm of the PLA officers and soldiers in building and defending the socialist motherland through several prominent events.
    The film is composed of five short segments. "Constructing the Hun River Irrigation Area in Liaoning" focuses on depicting the astonishing miracle of the PLA supporting agricultural construction. A huge irrigation project of 325 square kilometers, which originally required three years to complete, was completed in just twenty days through the joint efforts of 30,000 PLA officers and soldiers and the people of Liaoning, shortened from three years to two months, from two months to one month, and then from one month to twenty days. PLA officers and soldiers fought with the revolutionary spirit of climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, battling frozen soil as hard as stone and stinking muddy reed marshes that stuck to shovels, shoes, and socks. The film vividly portrays this revolutionary spirit of "moving mountains and creating seas" and the tenacious perseverance in conquering numerous difficulties. Through touching scenes such as the bride vacating her new house and the old woman sewing clothes and roasting socks for the soldiers, we once again deeply appreciate the flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people in socialist construction.
    "Regimental Commander as Platoon Leader" reflects the excellent tradition of unity between officers and soldiers in our army, and demonstrates the new atmosphere of leading cadres going down to the company, eating, living, operating, working, and entertaining with the soldiers. The spirit of Commander Ma patiently teaching soldiers and intimately caring for the lives of soldiers is very touching.
    "Reporting Advanced Experiences" and "Presenting Treasures to the Party" reflect the flourishing of the technical revolution throughout our army through fragments such as "saving gun cleaning cloth," "remodeling old umbrellas," "saving coal for cooking," "small repairs done in the company without going to the factory," and "building the army through diligence and thrift." At the same time, it also reveals the high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters of our army for building an excellent modern revolutionary army, demonstrating the commanders' and fighters' sense of ownership and the communist style of daring to speak, daring to think, and daring to act.
    In the short film "At the Chemical Warfare School," we are excited to see the growth of a new modern military branch.
    "The People's Liberation Army in the Great Leap Forward" is a good documentary. It is a true picture of the Great Leap Forward of our army and also a profound textbook. From it, we see how this People's Army, with high political awareness and unparalleled creativity, is enthusiastically participating in socialist construction and is guarding the socialist construction of the motherland with high vigilance, ready to fight the invaders to the end at any time!

    ——介绍电影“解放军在大跃进”

    在党的总路线光辉照耀下，解放军同全国人民一起以冲天的革命干劲，创造了千万个奇迹。“解放军在大跃进”这部纪录片通过了几个突出的事件，真实地反映了在大跃进中人民解放军的面貌，反映了解放军官兵建设和保卫社会主义祖国的无比热情。
    影片是以五个短片组成的。“修筑辽宁浑河灌溉区”集中地刻划了解放军支援农业建设的惊人奇迹。一个三百二十五平方公里的巨大的灌溉工程，原本需要三年时间才能完成，但在三万解放军官兵与辽宁人民的通力合作下，由三年提早到两个月，由两个月提早到一个月，又由一个月提早到二十天就完成了。解放军官兵都以爬雪山、过草地的革命精神同石头一样硬的冻土、粘住铁锹、鞋袜的臭泥苇塘决斗。影片生动地表现了这种“移山造海”的革命精神，与征服重重困难的顽强毅力，并且通过新娘腾新房，老大娘替战士缝衣、烤袜等动人场面，使我们又一次深深地体会到社会主义建设中亲如骨肉的军民关系。
    “大校当连长”反映了我军官兵一致的优良传统，表现了领导干部下连与士兵同吃、同住、同操作、同劳动、同娱乐的新气象。马大校耐心教导士兵，亲切地关心战士生活的精神很使人感动。
    “报先进”与“向党献宝”是通过“节约擦炮布”、“改装旧伞”、“节约炊事用煤”、“小修不进厂”、“勤俭建军”等等片断，反映了技术革命在我军遍地开花的盛况，同时也揭示了我军指战员对建设优良的现代化革命军队的高度责任感与积极性，表现了指战员的主人翁姿态与敢说、敢想、敢干的共产主义的风格。
    而在“在化学兵学校”这部短片里，则使我们兴奋地看到了一个新的现代化兵种的成长。
    “人民解放军在大跃进”是一部好的纪录片。它是我军大跃进的写真，又是一部意义深刻的教科书。从它里面我们看到这支具有高度政治觉悟和具有无比创造力的人民子弟兵，是如何热情地在参加着社会主义的建设，并且以高度的警惕来保卫着祖国的社会主义建设，准备随时和侵略者斗争到底！
