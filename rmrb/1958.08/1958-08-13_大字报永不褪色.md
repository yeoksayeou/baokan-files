Big-Character Posters Never Fade
　　Luo Yunjun
　　Recently, a trend has emerged within the Sichuan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection:
　　"Go to the big-character poster society to find out."
　　"Go to the big-character poster society to express your opinions."
　　"Go to the big-character poster society to see."
　　"Go to the big-character poster society to copy it."
　　Here, big-character posters continuously improve the thinking of cadres, and big-character posters continuously advance the work of the organization.
　　The big-character poster society of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection was established after the Double-Anti Campaign, and it is the development of big-character poster activities during the rectification movement.
　　When people step into the big-character poster society of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, the ten big-character poster columns, "Branch Life," "Red and Expert," "Great Leap Forward," "Hundred Flowers," "Testing," "Evaluation," "Speaking Out," "Labor and Defense," "Initiative," and "Gathering Styles," are prominently displayed before people's eyes. From the secretary to all the cadres, everyone posts big-character posters in these ten columns, expressing their opinions. In this organization, people feel a lively situation of both democracy and centralism.
　　Opening a notebook with the words "Comrade Dong Bicheng's Contribution Registration Book" written on the cover, more than thirty big-character poster titles are registered on it. Judging from its content, there are discussions of issues, opinions on work, and poems, lyrics, songs, and rhapsodies about work and ideology. This is the epitome of the big-character posters written by Comrade Dong Bicheng, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, in the past two months. When the leaders of the organization attach importance to big-character posters, the big-character posters can continuously consolidate and improve along the correct direction. The three full-time deputy secretaries of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection stationed in the organization post an average of one big-character poster every day. The reason why they are so interested in big-character posters is that big-character posters help their work. They often discover many important issues from big-character posters, which serve as the basis for their work research and guidance. In early July, two big-character posters on the issue of "experimental fields" in discipline inspection work appeared in the "Red and Expert" column. One believed that it was difficult for "experimental fields" in discipline inspection work to remain advanced forever, and the role of planting experimental fields was not significant. The other believed that there was no need to plant "experimental fields" in discipline inspection work. This attracted the attention of the leaders of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection. Deputy Secretaries Dong Bicheng and Qian Shouchang both posted enlightening big-character posters on this issue, guiding everyone to launch a debate on the issue of planting "experimental fields," gradually unifying ideological understanding, solving the problem of planting "experimental fields" in discipline inspection work that had not been solved for a long time, promoting business work, and improving the thinking of cadres.
　　The leaders of the organization consult with the cadres on many things through big-character posters, and they also discuss many tasks with the cadres through big-character posters. Big-character posters have become a tool for the leaders of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection to implement the mass line. A "work log" big-character poster compiled in the form of a doggerel is particularly eye-catching. This is the daily work arrangement and activities of Deputy Secretary Shi Chu when she worked in Ya'an, soliciting opinions from everyone on her work, which is very enlightening to everyone, especially helpful to the cadres who go to the countryside.
　　What is particularly concerning is the "Branch Life" column. In this column, there are branch work arrangements, organizational study plans, and personal red and expert plans. Not long ago, a big-character poster about the cadre theory study arrangement was posted in the "Branch Life" column, attracting many people to copy this study plan, and many people also put forward suggestions for revision. This is the mass line working method of the organization branch. Many resolutions of the organization branch of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection were decided after discussion with everyone using big-character posters. Big-character posters enriched the content of the organization branch work, and the activities of the organization branch work promoted the continuous progress of big-character posters.
　　Li Weishi, Secretary of the Organization Branch of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, told reporters: "The reason why our big-character posters can move forward forever is that they can combine politics and business, constantly put forward the center, and carry out continuous revolution." In the early stage of the establishment of the big-character poster society of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, although there were ten columns, many comrades were enthusiastic about "Hundred Flowers," and there were many big-character posters talking about culture and art. Because politics was not in command, the content of the big-character posters seemed poor, and then turned to a low tide. This is a lesson. In late May, a group of cadres from the organization were to be transferred to participate in the provincial party committee's production inspection team to work in the countryside. The big-character posters seized this opportunity to organize everyone to focus on "What should be done in the countryside?" and mobilize everyone to post big-character posters. At this time, big-character posters such as "How to combine central work with discipline inspection work," "Be the master or be the guest," "Be the commander or be the staff," emerged like mushrooms after a rain, launching a heated debate and setting off a climax of posting big-character posters, which solved both ideological problems and work problems. When this debate gradually came to an end, a big-character poster criticizing the poor growth of crops in the "experimental fields" planted in the organization appeared. The big-character poster society quickly shifted the focus of the debate to labor training, in order to set off the second debate climax. This not only enabled the comrades to have a further understanding of the labor viewpoint, but also all the cadres changed the backward appearance of the crops after three days of hard work. Immediately afterwards, a debate was launched on the big-character posters focusing on issues such as "Learning the working methods of cadres in the Nanbu County district and township," "How to treat the fourth stage of rectification," and "Whether cadres going to the countryside should stay at a point or run in circles." In this way, the big-character posters were both substantive and practical, grasping both politics and business. The big-character posters were one climax after another, constantly revolutionizing and constantly moving forward.
　　Here, big-character posters have become a powerful weapon for promoting work. In late June, Comrade Mu Xuping posted a fast-paced big-character poster entitled "Report Sigh," criticizing the phenomenon of backlog of cases in various departments, which attracted the attention of all cadres. The Archives Approval Department immediately posted a big-character poster to clear the backlog of archives in five days to welcome the Party's birthday. After five days and nights of hard work, a total of 100 cases were cleared, 40 appeals were made, and 23 letters from the people were processed. The quality of case handling was guaranteed, breaking the convention of handling one case every one or two days. The Industrial and Mining Supervision Department and the Local Supervision Department also joined the activity of clearing cases and issued a challenge to the Case Approval Department.
　　With the continuous consolidation and development of big-character posters, a new atmosphere has emerged in the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection.

　　大字报永不褪色
　　罗运钧
    在中共四川省监察委员会机关里，最近有这样一股风气：
    哪个处需要知道什么情况，“到大字报社了解去。”
    哪个人有什么意见，“到大字报社发表去。”
    领导同志又提出了什么要求，“到大字报社看看去。”
    党支部有什么新的活动计划，“到大字报社抄一份去。”
    在这里，大字报使干部思想不断提高，大字报使机关工作不断前进。
    省监委机关的大字报社，是在双反后建成的，它是整风中大字报活动的发展。
    当人们跨进省监委机关大字报社时，“支部生活”、“红专”、“跃进”、“百花”、“测验”、“评比”、“鸣放”、“劳卫”、“创议”、“采风”十个大字报专栏，非常醒目地展现在人们眼前。从书记到全体干部，都在这十个栏目里张贴大字报，各抒己见。在这个机关里，使人感到既有民主，又有集中的生动活泼局面。
    揭开一本封面上写着“董弼忱同志来稿登记簿”字样的本子，上面登记着三十多篇大字报的题目，从它的内容看，有对问题的探讨，有对工作的意见，也有谈工作，谈思想的诗、词、歌、赋。这便是省监委副书记董弼忱同志，两个月来所写的大字报的缩影。机关领导人对大字报重视，大字报就能沿着正确的方向，不断巩固提高。省监委三个驻机关的专职副书记，平均每天都要贴出一张大字报。他们对大字报之所以发生这样大的兴趣，是因为大字报帮助了他们的工作，他们往往从大字报上发现许多重要问题，作为他们研究工作、指导工作的依据。7月上旬，在
  “红专”栏里，出现了两篇对监察工作种
  “试验田”问题的大字报，一篇认为监察工作种“试验田”很难保持永远先进，种试验田的作用不大。一篇认为监察工作没有种“试验田”的必要。这就引起了省监委领导人的注意，副书记董弼忱和钱寿昌同志，都就这个问题贴出了启发性的大字报，引导大家就种“试验田”问题开展鸣放辩论，逐渐统一思想认识，解决了长期以来没有解决的监察工作种“试验田”的问题，推动了业务工作，提高了干部思想。
    机关领导人有许多事情都通过大字报和干部商量，有许多工作也通过大字报和干部讨论，大字报已成为省监委领导人贯彻群众路线的工具。一张用顺口溜编成的“工作日志”大字报，特别引人注意，这就是副书记石础同志到雅安工作时，每天的工作安排和活动，征求大家对她的工作提意见，对大家启发很大，特别是对下乡的干部有很大帮助。
    特别使人关心的，要数“支部生活”栏。在这个栏里，有支部工作安排，有机关的学习计划，也有个人的红专规划。不久前，“支部生活”栏里贴出了一张有关干部理论学习安排的大字报，引来了不少抄写这个学习计划的人，也有不少人对这个计划提出了修改意见。这是机关支部的群众路线的工作方法，省监委机关支部的许多决议，就是用大字报经过大家讨论后，才作出决定的。大字报丰富了机关支部工作的内容，机关支部工作的活动促进了大字报永远前进。
    省监委机关党支部书记李维实同志告诉记者：“我们的大字报之所以能永远前进，就因为它能使政治与业务相结合，不断提出中心，进行不断革命。”省监委建成大字报社初期，虽然有十个栏，但许多同志都热中于“百花”，谈文化艺术的大字报特别多，由于政治没有挂帅，大字报的内容显得贫乏，继而转向低潮。这是一个教训。5月下旬，机关中要抽调一批干部参加省委生产检查团下乡工作，大字报便紧紧抓住这个时机，组织大家以“下乡应作些什么”为中心，发动大家张贴大字报。这时，“中心工作与监察工作如何结合”，“当主人还是当客人”，“当主帅还是当参谋”等大字报像雨后春笋，展开了热烈的鸣放辩论，掀起了贴大字报高潮，既解决思想问题，又解决工作问题。这项辩论逐渐进入尾声时，又出现了一张批判机关里种的“试验田”庄稼长得不好的大字报，大字报社迅速把辩论中心转移到劳动锻炼上去，以掀起第二个辩论高潮。这不但使同志们对劳动观点有了更进一步的认识，而且全体干部经过三天苦战，改变了庄稼的落后面貌。紧接着，又以“学习南部县区乡干部的工作方法”，“怎样对待整风第四阶段”，以及“下乡干部是蹲点还是跑圈”等问题为中心，在大字报上开展了鸣放辩论。这样，大字报既务虚，又务实，既抓政治，也抓业务，大字报就一个高潮接一个高潮，不断革命，不断向前发展。
    在这里，大字报已成为推动工作的有力武器。6月下旬，牟绪平同志贴出了一张以“报告自叹”为题的快板大字报，批评了各个处积压案件的现象，引起了全体干部的注意。档案审批处立刻贴出了五天清完积压档案，迎接党的生日的大字报，经过五昼夜的苦战，共清理案件一百件，申诉四十件，人民来信二十三件，并保证了案件处理质量，打破了历来一两天才办一个案件的惯例。工矿监察处和地方监察处也卷入清理案件的活动，并向案件审批处贴出了挑战书。
    随着大字报的不断巩固和发展，省监委机关出现了日新又新的气象。
