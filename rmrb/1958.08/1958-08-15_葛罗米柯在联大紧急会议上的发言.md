Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 14th: A. A. Gromyko's speech at the UN Emergency Special Session on August 13th:

    Mr. Chairman!
    Distinguished Representatives!

    This Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly has become necessary due to the armed intervention of the United States in Lebanon and the United Kingdom in Jordan. Moreover, these two major powers, as permanent members of the Security Council and together with other permanent members of the Security Council bearing special responsibility for maintaining world peace, have become disruptors of peace. The fundamental foundations of international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter have been trampled upon. The landing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan has created a dangerous situation.

    The leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom often like to say that they abide by the purposes of the United Nations, but in practice, they show contempt for this international organization and the United Nations Charter. Behind the back of the United Nations, they have armedly invaded the Near East, attempting to consolidate their rule over the region, control its natural resources, and force the peoples of the Arab countries, who have suffered under foreign oppression for generations, to live once again under the conditions of the colonialist system.

    All the excuses for the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan are untenable.

    Of course, the national leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom, who are responsible for this policy, understand that in our time, military intervention in the internal affairs of other countries cannot but arouse a resolute rebuff from the powerful forces that cherish the cause of peace. Therefore, the planners of the intervention in Lebanon and Jordan have spent considerable effort to put a pretty coat on their actions. In order to justify this action, all sorts of excuses have been put forward—though each one is more untenable than the last.

    For example, they insist that the US and British military occupation of Lebanon and Jordan is to "maintain the independence of these countries" and defend them from conspiracies from the United Arab Republic. The internal events in Iraq have also been used as an excuse, this country, after these events, declared the establishment of a republic and abolished the federation with Jordan, this federation being the product of a conspiracy planned by imperialists in the Near East to oppose the independence of the Arab countries. Attempts have also been made to justify the landing of US and British troops with the excuse that this landing was carried out at the request of the President of Lebanon and the King of Jordan. Of course, there were also statements that the dispatch of troops, the transportation of weapons, tanks, warships, and aircraft, was to ensure the safety of US and British expatriates, but everyone knows that not a single American in Lebanon, nor a single Briton in Jordan, suffered the slightest harm, and they were not threatened in any way.

    They have thus simply trotted out the same reasons that the colonialists have used for decades to cover up the atrocities they have inflicted on the peoples of the Eastern countries.

    What can be said about all these reasons used to justify the intervention in Lebanon and Jordan?

    The US and British acts of aggression grossly violated the UN Charter and the norms of international law.

    The military actions taken by the United States and the United Kingdom in the Near East are acts that most brutally violate the United Nations Charter and other universal norms of international law, and the arguments that are now being put forward after the fact to justify these actions are equally unfounded and completely inconsistent with the facts.

    The attempt to add a layer of legitimacy to the US and British intervention in the Near East by claiming that US and British troops were invited in by Lebanese President Chamoun and Jordanian King Hussein is clearly completely untenable. Everyone knows that the practice of Chamoun and King Hussein inviting US and British troops into these countries is a violation of the principles of the Lebanese and Jordanian constitutions. This has been pointed out by many political figures in these two countries, including Lebanese Parliament Speaker Oseiran, who strongly condemned this illegal action in his letter to the UN member states. It should also be pointed out in passing that many prominent figures in Western countries have openly acknowledged that Chamoun and Hussein's request to the United States and the United Kingdom was directly instigated by the US and British governments.

    In view of the current attempt by the US government to portray the US aggression against Lebanon as a so-called completely legal action, as if it were a benevolent act towards the Lebanese people, I would like to present here an international document that the United States also signed. Article 17 of the Charter of the Organization of American States of April 30, 1948 states: "The territory of a state is inviolable; it may not be the object, even temporarily, of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another state, directly or indirectly, on any grounds whatsoever."

    In fact, for example, Washington and London, despite making groundless clamors about the United Arab Republic interfering in Lebanon and Jordan, cannot cite any facts of such interference. It is very clear that the reputable UN Observer Group dispatched to Lebanon according to the Security Council's decision—incidentally, the United States and the United Kingdom also voted in favor of it—completely overturned the claim of interference by the United Arab Republic in its two reports based on its study of the local situation. As everyone knows, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who visited Lebanon, also reached the same conclusion. But the US government disregarded the conclusions of the UN representatives because these conclusions did not suit those who were preparing and carrying out intervention in the Near East.

    As for citing the events in Iraq as one of the reasons that necessitated the dispatch of US and British troops to the Near East, if special evidence of the absurdity of these arbitrary assertions is needed, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom themselves have provided such evidence.

    Just a few days after the US representative spread the notion of so-called Iraqi "mob rule" in the Security Council and used the internal events of this country as the main excuse for the entry of foreign troops into Lebanon and Jordan, the United States and the United Kingdom announced their recognition of the government of the Republic of Iraq.

    It turns out that Washington only verbally condemns the military occupation of other countries when the United States cobbles together this or that group of countries under its protection and wants to reassure its participants not to worry about their intentions, while in reality, it describes the US occupation of Asian and African countries as completely justified, and even formulates a special "doctrine" stipulating that troops can be sent to these countries. To explain the situation in more detail, it must be pointed out that the US government has not followed its announced principle of condemning military occupation even with respect to the countries of the Western Hemisphere, as powerfully demonstrated by the fact that US troops entered a Latin American country last month.

    No matter how painstakingly the national leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom try to confuse the public and prevent them from knowing the true reasons for the armed intervention of these two countries in Lebanon and Jordan, no amount of pretense woven with false reasons can conceal the shameful fact of the unwarranted armed intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Arab countries.

    They also attempted to use Article 51 of the UN Charter, which stipulates the right of each country to collective self-defense, as a reason to send foreign troops into these two independent Arab countries. However, according to Article 51 of the aforementioned UN Charter, the right to collective self-defense can only be invoked "if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations," which shows that the application of the UN Charter here is completely artificial. However, even the US and British governments do not dare to say that Lebanon and Jordan have been subjected to armed aggression by other countries. If we are to talk about Article 51 of the UN Charter, then this article can be used as a reason to counter the armed intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom in Lebanon and Jordan.

    The US and British clamor about "indirect aggression" is an attempt to conceal their direct acts of aggression. They are the ones who have been carrying out indirect aggression against other countries for a long time.

    Finally, in order to justify US and British armed intervention, the lie of so-called "indirect aggression" was trotted out, claiming that this "indirect aggression" threatened Lebanon and Jordan from the east, from the south, from the north, in short, from every direction except from the west, that is, the direction from which the armed forces that were truly invading Lebanon and Jordan came.

    The argument of so-called "indirect aggression" is merely a propaganda trick that the US and British governments are attempting to use to conceal their direct aggression against the Near East.

    The fact that US and British officials are currently talking about the need to prevent so-called "indirect aggression" in the Near East, which does not exist at all, and that this talk of "indirect aggression" is unfounded can also be seen from the fact that the governments of these two countries, since Dumbarton Oaks, have for many years buried in the United Nations all the efforts of the Soviet Union and other countries to define aggression, including indirect aggression. The lack of a definition of aggression can only be exploited by those who plan aggressive acts. Of course, whoever has such intentions will not care about the definition of aggression. Combined with the recent actions of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Near East, one can particularly understand why they did not want to reach an agreement on the definition of aggression. Therefore, it cannot be considered accidental that US Secretary of State Dulles said at the end of last month that he saw no need to formulate a definition of aggression. When one is actually engaged in aggressive activities, what definition of aggression is there to talk about!

    The US government has recently intensified its search for arguments that can justify US armed intervention in Lebanon. This has become particularly evident in recent days due to the holding of the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. As I pointed out, such a claim has emerged as if the actions of the United States were caused by some kind of indirect aggression against Lebanon by certain countries.

    Needless to say, all these claims that someone is carrying out some kind of "indirect aggression" against Lebanon are unfounded. But it seems that those who fabricate this rumor want to confuse some gullible people. As usual, whenever this happens, the propaganda machine is cranked up to spread this rumor.

    If one starts from the facts, it should be acknowledged that this is obviously an attempt to shift the blame for the guilty actions done by the United States, more precisely, by those American figures who are responsible for American foreign policy, onto others. They are the ones who have been carrying out "indirect aggression" against other countries for a long time. We only need to list the situation after the end of World War II to find that the world has witnessed such aggressive actions by the United States against other countries more than once. Moreover, it can be said with certainty that "indirect aggression" has simply become an integral part of American foreign policy.

    Oil, oil, and more oil—this is what lures the US and the UK into military adventures in the Middle East.

    Distinguished Representatives!

    The armed aggression of the United States and the United Kingdom against Lebanon and Jordan is undoubtedly a plan to begin marching into other Arab countries. This armed aggression is a typical act of the colonialists, whose main motive has always been to extract profits by exploiting the oppressed peoples of dependent countries. According to published materials, US oil monopoly groups extracted profits of 2.5 billion US dollars from Near Eastern countries alone from 1956 to 1957. Oil, oil, and still more oil—this is what lures US and UK monopoly groups to the Arab East, causing them to constantly engage in military adventures in this region.

    It can be said that the US military occupation of Lebanon is the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." If before this recent period some people in certain places in the East or in some other countries still harbored some illusions about the nonexistent American "anti-colonialism," then these illusions should now be shattered. During the Suez War, the United States allowed its NATO allies to carry out direct aggression, while it preferred to hide behind them. This time it is different, Washington has decided to firmly hold the hand of the British to act together. It is clear that the United States and the United Kingdom are obviously colluding to suppress the national liberation movement in the Middle East, and the United States is increasingly resolutely personally taking the reins of the shaky colonialist chariot.

    What unites the decision-makers of the United States and the United Kingdom is the common interest of exploiting the peoples of the East, as well as their common military strategic plans aimed at opposing socialist countries and countries that have recently freed themselves from colonial and semi-colonial dependence.

    For many years after World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom, based on the common goals of their policies, have been attempting to turn the Middle East, which is adjacent to the southern border of the Soviet Union, into their military base, which is no secret. This attempt has been met with resolute resistance from the peoples of the Arab countries, who have repeatedly proven with eloquent facts that they are unwilling to be pawns in the war plans of Western countries.

    Now that the last pillar of foreign imperialism in this region, the Baghdad Pact (the name itself has become an antique today), has begun to collapse, the leaders of US and British foreign policy have embarked on the dangerous road of war adventures. Soldiers, tanks, bombers, and even atomic weapons, which the US Secretary of Defense has openly threatened to use against the Arabs, are the means intended to be used to "resolve" the situation in the Middle East for their own benefit. Does one still need to say how dangerous this act of playing with fire in a region of the world that is extremely prone to incidents is, and what a threat it poses to the cause of maintaining universal peace?

    The conspirators' plots against Iraq and other Arab countries were thwarted, but the danger of war in the Middle East has not been eliminated.

    Naturally, in this situation, countries adjacent to the Middle East had to take the necessary measures to ensure their own security. As the Soviet government has repeatedly stated publicly: the Soviet Union cannot ignore the emergence of a serious spark of war danger right next to its borders.

    Contrary to the comforting remarks that can often be heard, the situation in the Middle East remains tense. There are still many hidden reefs in this area that could wreck the ship of peace.

    Although the armed intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom has aroused the anger of the peoples of the attacked countries and the peoples of all other countries, foreign troops are still continuing to gather in the Arab East in a blatant manner. This can be confirmed by reading any American newspaper.

    If the resolute resistance of the Arab people and the firm attitude of other peace-loving countries have thwarted the conspirators' plots against the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries at this stage, it does not mean that the danger of war in the Near East has been eliminated.

    The danger caused by the US and British armed intervention concerns all countries. It would be a fatally harmful mistake to reassure oneself by thinking that the intervention will not expand for the time being.

    It would be a fatally harmful mistake if UN member states were to reassure themselves that the current US and British military intervention in the Near East is limited to the two small countries of Lebanon and Jordan and will not expand for the time being. As long as the US and British armed forces that invaded Lebanon and Jordan remain there, the danger of escalation and intensification of military conflict remains.

    In some countries, there are some leaders who probably think this way: all these events in Lebanon and Jordan are happening in faraway places, they have nothing to do with us, therefore, there is no special reason to be uneasy about them.

    The Soviet delegation wants to resolutely emphasize that this logic is very wrong. The danger facing the world due to the armed intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Near East concerns all countries. If the countries that sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan can gain a foothold there and can benefit from this action, then there is no doubt that things will certainly not be limited to the Near East. The policy of creating fait accompli that the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom are now trying to implement risks pushing mankind into a new abyss of war with serious consequences. Some skeptics and optimists deny the danger to peace caused by the aforementioned actions of the United States and the United Kingdom, and this group of people does exist. To these people, it can be said: you are no different from those Western people before, who, on the eve of World War II, even when the sky was already filled with the smell of gunpowder, still kept reassuring themselves and others that there was no need to panic, that nothing would go wrong. But later, things did go wrong. A few weeks ago, or even a few days ago, it seemed to these people that tragedy could still be prevented, that the sky was still shining with the sun as before. However, the storm broke out, and as a result, the flames of war destroyed the lives of millions of people and destroyed countless material wealth. People might say that what happened at that time was some sudden and unforeseeable event. However, where are those optimists who, on the one hand, try to comfort the gullible with the claim that foreign intervention in the Near East poses no danger, that the increasing number of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons also pose no danger, and on the other hand, can say with a clear conscience that the world will never witness events that will also be called sudden and unforeseeable by future historians—where are those optimists?

    The situation formed in the Middle East due to the invasion of US and British troops also has an extremely dangerous aspect, which cannot be forgotten. When the US and British governments carried out aggression in this region, they tried in various ways to drag a series of other countries, primarily members of the North Atlantic Alliance, into the aggression, thereby making these countries participants. The territories of the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and Turkey are being used to transport US troops to Lebanon.

    The residents of the island of Cyprus, who have been fighting for many years to break free from foreign rule, are now being used as a base for armed forces sent to Jordan. The airspace of Israel is being widely used to mobilize British troops. It must be pointed out that due to these actions of the United States and the United Kingdom, the North Atlantic Alliance particularly blatantly appears to be a military bloc, one of whose tasks is to suppress national liberation movements and implement colonialist enslavement of various peoples. Obviously, playing the role of accomplice in colonialist adventures cannot be considered to be in line with the national interests of West Germany, Italy, and Turkey. Here, I would like to talk about the regrettable role played by Turkey, a neighbor of the Soviet Union, in this Middle East incident. We firmly believe that this role cannot be in line with Turkey's interests at all, because any complication of the situation in the Near East and any turbulence in the region will only drag Turkey into the vortex of war, and will bring Turkey nothing but poverty. The Soviet Union sincerely hopes to establish good relations with Turkey, and it is precisely out of this consideration that the Soviet government warned the Turkish government to pay attention to the dangers of supporting the current US and British actions in the Near East.

    Historical events prove that the road of military adventures is a dead end for adventurers.

    It is often heard from Western countries, especially the United Kingdom, that their actions in the Middle East are determined by their stake in Near Eastern oil. Speaking of this, I would like to mention that during the Soviet-British negotiations held in London in 1956, the then British Prime Minister Eden stated that the United Kingdom could fight for Near Eastern oil, considering the significance of oil to the British economy. Khrushchev reminded the British national activists at that time that the policy of colonialist oppression and plunder is unimaginable and doomed to failure now. The British national activists were given friendly advice at that time: do not launch a war against the Arabs, because this will inevitably lead to tragic consequences, first of all tragic consequences for the United Kingdom. They did not heed this advice, launched an aggression against Egypt, and as a result suffered a disgraceful defeat, as everyone knows.

    The events of 1956 proved that the road of military adventures is a dead end for adventurers. Now we are witnessing similar events in the Near East again.

    The United States and the United Kingdom carried out armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan precisely when preparations were being made for the Soviet-proposed summit conference aimed at curbing the "Cold War" and the arms race, and precisely when the Soviet Union passed the historic decision on unilaterally ceasing the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. Therefore, people cannot help but ask: do the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom intend that one of the results of the actions taken by their two countries against Lebanon and Jordan should be to undermine the already emerging changes in the international situation, which they do not like?

    The Soviet Union has long called for an agreement between the major powers not to interfere in the affairs of the Near Eastern countries.

    Today, when the US and British armed intervention in the Near East has put the world in a dangerous situation, it is particularly evident that it is very necessary to end the dangerous policy of "power status" and to solve international problems with a rational attitude. If the major powers can reach an agreement not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Near Eastern countries and to strictly respect their sovereignty and territorial integrity, that would be a big step forward on this road. The Soviet Union has long called for such an agreement, because it not only meets the task of maintaining world peace, but also, we feel, is of course beneficial from the perspective of the interests of Western countries, because such an agreement will be one of the necessary factors for Western countries to establish stable political and economic relations with the countries in this region.

    I would like to remind the General Assembly of the proposals made by the Soviet government to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France as early as February 1957. As everyone knows, the Soviet government proposed reaching an agreement in which the governments of the major powers would undertake certain obligations in guaranteeing lasting peace in the Middle East. The most important of these is: to require that pressing issues be resolved only through peaceful means on the basis of negotiations, not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Near Eastern countries, to respect the sovereignty and independence of these countries, and to withdraw all foreign troops from their territories.

    Who can deny that, due to the events currently occurring in the Middle East, these proposals have become of greater urgency?

    An agreement between the major powers not to interfere in the affairs of the Near Eastern countries will be a very necessary prerequisite for solving the problems in this region, which will be beneficial to the people of this region and to peace. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is of course necessary to dispel attempts to solve problems by using force, which requires stopping aggressive actions, and first of all, withdrawing foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. In order to consolidate peace, it is necessary to confirm one's desire for peace with practical actions, and not just talk about hoping for peace in declarations.

    To restore peace in the Middle East, it is necessary to make the foreign intervention forces immediately, unconditionally, and completely withdraw from the Arab East.

    Why are US troops and British troops stationed in Lebanon and Jordan? Why continue to gather troops and send more and more troops and weapons there? How is all this connected with the peace-loving declarations made by the US government and the British government?

    The current actions of the Americans and the British are even making those who previously liked to downplay the danger of the US and British military intervention in the Near East to some extent begin to face the reality. The peoples of the Arab countries are angrily demanding the withdrawal of the interventionist troops. The newly elected President of Lebanon also mentioned this in a recent statement, declaring that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon is the main task of Lebanon's national policy. It must be made clear that in order to restore peace in the Middle East, it is necessary to make the foreign intervention forces immediately, unconditionally, and completely withdraw from the Arab East. Doing so is particularly necessary at present, because there is a certain trend at present to try to keep foreign troops in Lebanon and Jordan by various means. Needless to say, keeping foreign troops in Lebanon and Jordan is a mockery of the principles of the United Nations and a serious blow to the prestige of the United Nations.

    We are now hearing the argument that foreign troops should remain in the Middle East until so-called "order is restored" and "the situation is stabilized." There is no need to explain in detail how dangerous the path that some people are trying to push the United Nations onto is. If every country or group of countries believes that it has the right to impose an order that suits it in other countries and claims to be the advocate of justice, then there will be no truth in international affairs, there will be no place for the United Nations, and hegemony and power will dominate relations between countries.

    Everyone already knows that the US government is pretentiously planning to withdraw one battalion of the occupying forces from Lebanon, which does not need to be discussed much. There is no need to prove that this stagecraft is completely irrelevant to taking practical measures to maintain peace in the Middle East and restore the independence of the occupied Arab countries. Sending dozens of battalions of troops to the territory of another country, and then loudly touting the withdrawal of one battalion, is an attempt to comfort various countries with the US government's plan to withdraw troops.

    The US and the UK are talking about economic aid to the Middle East in order to divert the attention of the world public.

    Another trick that has been frequently adopted recently cannot be ignored. In order to divert the attention of the world public from the US and British troop buildup in the territory of the Near Eastern countries, US and British officials are increasingly frequently claiming that they hope to promote the economic development of the Near Eastern countries. We also heard this from US President Eisenhower in his speech at our UN forum today.

    Helping Near Eastern countries develop their economies is naturally a good thing. The Soviet Union has always advocated providing such assistance without any political or military conditions, and in fact has built its relations with other countries on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit, and the same is true of its relations with Near Eastern countries.

    The idea of providing economic assistance to Near Eastern countries that the US President talked about in his speech here naturally needs to be studied accordingly. However, a major issue should be resolved first—the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. It is completely unacceptable to try to divert the attention of the General Assembly with talk of economic aid, so that it will not pay attention to solving this major issue. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet Union most resolutely advocates that the issue of withdrawing US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan must be resolved immediately and must be resolved first.

    The Soviet Union has no selfish purpose in the Middle East, and what it cares about is maintaining peace in this region and the independence of the peoples of all countries.

    After the United States, and then the United Kingdom, launched armed intervention in the Arab East, the Soviet Union immediately requested the UN Security Council to take the most urgent measures to stop the aggression and defend the national independence of the Arab countries that had been subjected to unwarranted attacks. However, the Security Council, because most of its member states are participants in military blocs, and the heads of these military blocs are precisely the countries that are invading the Near East, has failed to fulfill its obligations. Therefore, the Soviet government proposed convening a meeting of the heads of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and India, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General. However, the US and British governments prevented this meeting from taking place.

    In this situation, the Soviet government believes that it has a responsibility to submit the issue of the unimpeded withdrawal of foreign troops from the Arab East and the restoration of peace in this region to the Emergency Session of the UN General Assembly for discussion.

    The Soviet Union firmly demands that US and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan out of concern for maintaining universal peace and the security interests of the peoples of all countries. The Soviet Union has no selfish purposes or secret interests in the Near East. The Soviet Union has neither a soldier nor a military base there; neither oil privileges nor investments. Naturally, what the Soviet Union cares about in the Near East is: maintaining lasting and consolidated peace in this region, and guaranteeing the possibility of free and independent development for the peoples of all countries in this region. I would also like to emphasize another point here. The Soviet Union proposed convening this Emergency Session of the UN General Assembly and demanded at the meeting that US and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, not in order to sharpen the relations between our country and the United States and the United Kingdom, or to cause some loss to the prestige of these two countries. We also do not want to worsen the relations between these two countries and the countries of the Arab East in the slightest. We would only be happy if this relationship could develop smoothly on the basis of peaceful cooperation and full respect for the national sovereignty and independence of the Arab countries. As everyone knows, the Soviet government itself is also striving to establish good relations of full trust with the United States and the United Kingdom, but so far this relationship has not been established, and this is not our fault.

    We have not failed to see that whether in the United States or in the United Kingdom, there are some people who believe that the actions of the Washington government and the London government in the Near East have gone too far, so that withdrawing troops from Lebanon and Jordan in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations cannot but affect their own prestige. Perhaps this view is understandable to some extent, but in any case it cannot be agreed with. If the US and British governments are truly willing to help find the right path to resolve the current tension and consolidate peace, then after fully weighing the pros and cons, they will understand that it is necessary to withdraw their troops from the Middle East. This will not only not affect their prestige, but on the contrary, will greatly enhance their prestige in the eyes of the world public.

    Hope that the General Assembly will discuss the proposal to immediately withdraw US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

    Distinguished Representatives!

    The issue to be discussed at this Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly is of great importance. Perhaps our organization has never had such an opportunity as now to make an important contribution to the cause of maintaining world peace.

    The Soviet delegation, entrusted by the Soviet government, has submitted the following proposal to the Emergency Session of the United Nations General Assembly for discussion:

    "On the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

    The General Assembly,

    Considering that in order to maintain world peace, it is necessary to take urgent measures to ease the tension in the Middle East,

    Specially recommends that the US government and the British government withdraw their troops from the territories of Lebanon and Jordan without delay,

    Entrusts the UN Secretary-General to strengthen the UN Observer Group in Lebanon in accordance with the plan proposed in the second report of the UN Observer Group in Lebanon, and to send an observer group to Jordan to monitor the withdrawal of US troops and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan and the border situation of these two countries".

    The Soviet delegation submits this proposal, believing that the UN General Assembly will discuss this proposal with due attention and responsibility. I think we would not be wrong if we said that the vast majority of UN member states advocate the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East. Some people are openly stating this, others are shrinking from talking about it, and still others have said almost nothing, but things do not change because of this.

    As everyone knows, many participants in the UN General Assembly are looking for appropriate plans to put forward the request for the US and the UK to withdraw troops. Of course, as long as there is a real desire to promote this only correct solution, then plans are not difficult to find. We believe that the proposal of the Soviet delegation contains an appropriate plan. This does not mean that we refuse to look for mutually acceptable plans developed after considering the opinions of other delegations, as long as they conform to the main purpose—the unimpeded withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. We are willing to immediately conduct formal and informal consultations with any delegation, including the US and British delegations, on drafting the kind of constructive resolution that the UN General Assembly might adopt for peace.

    The Soviet government hopes that the Emergency Session of the UN General Assembly will worthily complete the task it faces of restoring peace in the Middle East.

    The Soviet Union, like other peace-loving countries, will continue to make all necessary efforts to unswervingly defend and maintain the cause of peace in the future. The recent communiqué of the meeting between Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers N. S. Khrushchev and Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong, jointly issued by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, vividly expresses this determination.

    These are what the Soviet delegation attending this UN General Assembly session is following. If we all take a highly responsible attitude towards the results of this meeting, this meeting can serve the cause of peace very well.

    葛罗米柯在联大紧急会议上的发言
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：安·安·葛罗米柯8月13日在联合国大会紧急特别会议上的发言：
    主席先生！
    代表先生们！
    由于美国对黎巴嫩，英国对约旦进行武装干涉，召开这一次联合国大会紧急特别会议成了必要的事。况且这两个身为安全理事会常任理事国、并同安全理事会其他常任理事国一同对维护世界和平负有特别责任的大国，竟成了和平的破坏者。国际法的基本基础和联合国宪章的原则遭到了蹂躏。美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆造成了危险的局势。
    美英两国领导人常常喜欢说他们遵奉联合国的宗旨，实际上却表现为藐视这个国际组织和联合国宪章，他们背着联合国武装侵入近东，企图巩固他们对这个地区的统治，控制这个地区的天然富源，迫使世世代代在外国压迫下受苦受难的阿拉伯国家人民重新在殖民主义制度的条件下生活。
    美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的一切借口都站不住脚
    当然，对这种政策负责的美英两国的国家领导人明白，在我们的时代对其他国家的内政进行军事干涉，不可能不引起珍惜和平事业的强大力量的坚决回击。因此，干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的策划者花了不少气力来给自己的行动披上漂亮的外衣。为了替这种行动辩解，不论什么样的借口都提出来了——虽然一个比一个站不住脚。
    例如，硬说什么美英两国对黎巴嫩和约旦的军事占领是为了“维护这些国家的独立”和防御来自阿拉伯联合共和国方面的阴谋。伊拉克的内部事件也被拿来作借口，这个国家经过这些事件后宣布成立共和国并废除了同约旦的联邦，这个联邦是帝国主义者为了反对阿拉伯各国人民的独立而在近东策划的阴谋的产物。人们还企图利用下列借口为美英军队的登陆辩解，即这次登陆是应黎巴嫩总统和约旦国王的请求而进行的。当然，还作了这样的声明，说派遣军队、运去武器、坦克、军舰和飞机，是为了保障美英侨民的安全，然而大家知道，在黎巴嫩的美国人、在约旦的英国人没有一个人受到丝毫的损害，他们根本没有受到任何威胁。
    他们就是这样地干脆搬出了上述的殖民主义者几十年来一直用来掩盖他们对东方各国人民所施行的暴行的理由。
    关于所有这些用来为干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的行为辩护的理由有什么可说的呢？
    美英侵略行为粗暴破坏了联合国宪章和国际法准则
    美国和英国在近东所采取的军事行动是一种最粗暴地破坏联合国宪章和其他国际法普遍准则的行为，而现在事后提出来为这些行动辩护的一些论据，也同样是没有任何根据的，并且是完全不符合事实的。
    企图给美英对近东的干涉加上一层合法的外衣而借口说美英军队当时是应黎巴嫩总统夏蒙和约旦国王侯赛因的邀请而开进去的，这种企图很明显也是完全站不住脚的。大家知道，夏蒙和侯赛因国王邀请美英军队进驻这些国家这种做法，是破坏黎巴嫩和约旦宪法的原则的。这一点，这两个国家的许多政界人士已经指出过，其中黎巴嫩议长奥塞兰在他致联合国各会员国的信中，就曾经坚决谴责过这种非法行动。还应该顺便指出，西方国家许多著名人士都公开承认，夏蒙和侯赛因对美国和英国的这种请求是美国和英国政府所直接唆使的。
    鉴于目前美国政府企图把美国侵犯黎巴嫩说成是所谓完全合法的行动，好像还是对黎巴嫩人民的善行，我想在这里提出一个美国也签了字的国际文件。1948年4月30日的美洲国家组织宪章第十七条说：“国家的领土是不可侵犯的，甚至不能暂时成为军事占领或某些国家不论出于什么动机而直接间接采取的其他暴力措施的对象。”
    事实上，例如，华盛顿和伦敦尽管无中生有地叫嚷所谓阿拉伯联合共和国干涉黎巴嫩和约旦，但是并不能举出任何这种干涉的事实。大家很清楚，根据安全理事会的决定——顺便说一下，美国和英国也投票赞同的——派遣到黎巴嫩去的有威望的联合国观察团在根据对当地情况的研究而提出的两次报告中，完全推翻了所谓阿拉伯联合共和国进行干涉的说法。大家知道，到黎巴嫩去访问过的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生也作出了同样的结论。但是美国政府毫不考虑联合国的代表的结论，因为这些结论不合那些在近东准备并进行干涉的人的心意。
    至于说到借口伊拉克事件作为引起美国和英国军队必须派兵到近东去的理由之一这一点，那么，如果需要对这些武断说法的荒谬性提出特别证据的话，美国和英国的政府自己就提出了这样的证据。
    美国代表在安全理事会散布了所谓伊拉克“暴民统治”的说法并且利用这个国家的内部事件作为外国军队开入黎巴嫩和约旦的主要借口之后刚刚过了几天，美国和英国就宣布承认伊拉克共和国政府。
    原来华盛顿认为，当美国在自己的庇护下拼凑这个或那个国家集团，并想要安慰它的参加者不要对他们的意图担心时，才在口头上谴责对别国的军事占领，而实际上则把美国对亚洲和非洲国家的这种占领说成是完全合理的，甚至制定一种专门的“主义”，规定可以把军队开往这些国家。为了把情况讲得更详尽，必须指出，美国政府对西半球的国家也没有遵循它所宣布的谴责军事占领的原则，上月美国军队进驻一个拉丁美洲国家一事就有力地证明了这一点。
    不论美国和英国的国家领导人如何处心积虑地企图混淆视听，不让世界公众知道这两个国家武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的真正原因，然而，用虚伪的理由编造的任何外衣都掩饰不了美国和英国无端武装干涉阿拉伯国家的可耻事实。
    他们还企图利用规定各国有权集体自卫的联合国宪章第五十一条来作为把外国军队开入这两个自主的阿拉伯国家的理由。但是根据上述的联合国宪章第五十一条，只有在“联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时”，才可以谈到运用集体自卫的权利，由此可见，在这里套用联合国宪章完全是人为的。然而，甚至连美英政府也不敢说，黎巴嫩和约旦遭到了别国的武装进攻。如果要谈到联合国宪章第五十一条的话，那么倒可以运用这一条作为理由来反击美英两国对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉。
    美英叫喊“间接侵略”是企图掩饰它们的直接侵略行为。长期以来对他国进行间接侵略的正是他们自己。
    最后，为了为美英武装干涉作辩护，搬出了所谓“间接侵略”的谎言，硬说这种“间接侵略”从东边、从南边、从北边威胁着黎巴嫩和约旦，总而言之，除了从西边，也就是说，侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的武装力量真正来自的那个方向以外，从各个方向威胁着黎巴嫩和约旦。
    所谓“间接侵略”的议论只不过是一种宣传的花招，美英政府企图用以掩饰它们对近东的直接侵略。
    目前美国和英国官方人士谈论必须防止在近东根本不存在的所谓“间接侵略”，这种“间接侵略”的说法是毫无根据的，这一点从下列事实也可以看出来：正是这两个国家政府从敦巴顿橡树园那时起，许多年来在联合国中埋葬了苏联和其他国家为了确定侵略、其中也包括间接侵略的定义而作的一切努力。因为缺少侵略定义这一情况只会被那些策划侵略行动的人所利用。当然，谁有这种意图，谁就不会对侵略的定义关心。结合美国和英国在近东的最近行动来看，对于它们所以不希望取得一致同意的侵略定义，就特别可以理解了。因此，美国国务卿杜勒斯先生上个月月底说，他认为无需制定侵略的定义，他讲这话就不能认为是偶然的了。当实际上从事侵略勾当的时候，还谈得到什么侵略定义呢！
    美国政府最近加紧寻找能够为美国武装干涉黎巴嫩辩解的论据。最近几天由于要举行联合国大会紧急会议了，这一点格外明显。正如我所指出的，出现这样一种说法，仿佛美国的行动是由于某些国家对黎巴嫩采取某种间接侵略而引起的。
    不用说，这一切所谓有人对黎巴嫩实行某种“间接侵略”的说法是毫无根据的。但是看来捏造这种谰言的人是想用它来迷惑一些轻信的人。像往常一样，每逢到这种情况，宣传机器就开足了马力来散布这种谰言。
    如果从事实出发，那就应当承认，这显然是企图把美国，确切些说，是那些对美国外交政策负责的美国人士所做的有罪的行动推诿到他人身上。长期以来对他国进行“间接侵略”的正是他们自己。我们只要列举第二次世界大战结束之后的情况，就可以发现，全世界不止一次地亲眼看到美国对其他国家的这种侵略行动。而且，可以肯定地说，“间接侵略”简直已经成了美国外交政策的组成部分了。
    石油，石油，还是石油——这就是引诱美英在中东进行军事冒险的东西。
    代表先生们！
    美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦采取的武装侵略，无疑是一个开始向其他阿拉伯国家进军的计划，这种武装侵略是殖民主义者的典型行为，他们的主要动机一直是企图通过对附属国的被压迫的人民的剥削榨取利润。根据公布的材料，仅1956年至1957年期间，美国石油垄断集团就从近东国家榨取了二十五亿美元的利润。石油，石油，还是石油，——这就是引诱美国和英国垄断集团到阿拉伯东方去，使它们不断在这个地区进行军事冒险的东西。
    可以说，美国对黎巴嫩的军事占领就是“艾森豪威尔主义”的实施。如果在最近这段时期以前东方某些地方或某些其他国家还有人对并不存在的美国的“反殖民主义”抱着某种幻想的话，那么这种幻想现在该破灭了。在苏伊士战争期间，美国让它的北大西洋公约组织的盟国进行直接侵略，而自己宁可躲在后面。这次就不同了，华盛顿决定紧紧地抓住英国人的手一道行动。可见美国和英国显然是在狼狈为奸，以镇压中近东国家中的民族解放运动，而且美国越来越坚决地亲自为摇摆不定的殖民主义战车执缰驭马。
    把美国和英国决策人联结在一起的是对东方人民进行剥削这种共同利益，还有他们目的在于反对社会主义国家和不久前摆脱殖民地和半殖民地附属地位的国家的共同军事战略计划。
    在第二次世界大战后的很多年里，美国和英国根据它们政策的共同目的，一直企图把同苏联南部国境毗邻的中近东地区变成它们的军事基地，这一点并不是什么秘密。这种企图遭到阿拉伯国家人民的坚决反抗，他们接二连三地以雄辩的事实证明，他们不愿意做西方国家战争计划中的走卒。
    现在，外国帝国主义在这个地区的最后支柱巴格达条约（这个名称本身今天已经成了一件古董）已开始垮台了，于是美英两国外交政策领导人走上了危险的战争冒险的道路。士兵，坦克，轰炸机，甚至美国国防部长已经公开威胁准备对阿拉伯人使用的原子武器，这些就是打算用来“解决”中近东地区局势为自己谋利的手段。这种在世界一个极易爆发事件的地区玩火的勾当有多么危险，它对维护普遍和平事业造成怎样的威胁，还用得着说吗？
    侵略者对伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家的阴谋遭到挫败，但是，中东的战争危险并未消除。
    自然，在这种情况下，同中近东地区相毗邻的国家不得不采取保证本身安全的必要措施。如苏联政府已一再公开表明的：苏联对紧挨着它边境出现严重的战争危险火苗这种情况不能置之不理。
    同可以常常听到的安慰人心的言论相反，中近东的局势仍然紧张。仍然有着不少会使和平大船在这个地区撞碎的暗礁。
    尽管美国和英国的武装干涉激起了遭到侵略的国家的人民以及所有其他国家人民的愤怒，外国军队至今仍在明目张胆地继续往阿拉伯东方集结。只要读一下任何一种美国报纸，都可以证实这一点。
    如果说，阿拉伯人民的坚决反击和其他爱好和平国家的坚定态度使侵略者对伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的阴谋在现阶段遭到了挫败的话，那么，这还不等于说在近东的战争危险已经消除了。
    美英武装干涉造成的危险，关系到所有的国家。认为干涉暂时不会扩大而自我安慰，将是一个有致命危害的大错。
    如果联合国会员国以为现在美国和英国对近东的军事干涉仅限于黎巴嫩和约旦这两个不大的国家，暂时不会扩大，而自我安慰的话，那将是一个有致命危害的大错。只要入侵黎巴嫩和约旦的美国和英国的武装部队还留在那里，军事冲突的扩大和尖锐化的危险就仍旧存在。
    在某些国家中，有这样一些领导人，他们大概这样考虑：在黎巴嫩和约旦的这一切事件是在遥远的地方发生的，同我们无关，因此，没有特别的理由为此不安。
    苏联代表团要坚决地强调指出，这种逻辑是十分错误的。由于美国和英国对近东进行武装干涉而使世界所面临的危险，是关系到所有的国家的。如果派军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的那些国家，能够在那里站稳脚并且能够从这种行动中有所收获的话，那么毫无疑问事情就决不会限于中近东了。美国和英国的领导人现在竭力实施的造成既成事实的政策，有把人类推入后果严重的新战争深渊的危险。有些怀疑主义者和乐天主义者否认美英两国的上述行动对和平造成的危险，而这派人确实存在，对这些人可以这样说：你们同以前西方这种人士没有什么差别，这些人在第二次世界大战前夕，甚至当天空已弥漫着火药气味的时候，还不断地安慰自己和别人说，用不着惊慌，不会出什么乱子。但是后来乱子却发生了。在几个星期之前，甚至在几天前，在这些人看来，似乎悲剧还可以防止，似乎天空还像以前一样闪耀着太阳。然而，暴风雨发生了，结果战争的火焰毁灭了千百万人的生命，毁灭了难以计算的物质财富。人们也许会说，当时所发生的是一些突然的难以预料的事件。然而，哪里有这样的乐天派：他们一方面企图用以下一些说法来宽慰轻信的人，说什么外国对近东的干涉没有任何危险，说什么数量越来越多的原子武器和氢武器也没有什么危险，另一方面，又能够凭良心说，世界再不会目睹被将来的历史学家也称之为突然的和难以预料的事件——哪里有这样的乐天派呢？
    由于美英两国军队的侵入而在中近东形成的局势还有极其危险的一面，对这危险的一面不能忘记。美国和英国政府在这个地区进行侵略时，力图用种种形式把一系列其他国家、首先是北大西洋联盟成员国拖进侵略中，从而使这些国家成为参与者。德意志联邦共和国、意大利、土耳其的领土正被用来调运美国军队到黎巴嫩去。
    塞浦路斯岛居民已经进行了许多年摆脱外国统治的斗争，这个岛现在被用作派往约旦的武装力量的基地。以色列的领空被广泛地用来调动英国军队。必须指出，由于美英两国的这些行动，北大西洋联盟就特别露骨地显得是个军事集团，这个集团的任务之一就是要镇压民族解放运动和对各国人民实行殖民主义的奴役。显然，在殖民主义冒险中扮演帮凶的角色决不能认为是符合西德、意大利和土耳其的民族利益。这里，我想谈谈苏联邻国土耳其在这次中近东事件中所起的令人遗憾的作用。我们坚信，这种作用完全不能符合土耳其的利益，因为近东局势的任何复杂化和该地区的任何动荡都只会把土耳其拖到战争的漩涡中去，除了贫困外，不会给土耳其带来任何东西。苏联真诚希望同土耳其建立良好的关系，苏联政府正是从这种考虑出发，警告土耳其政府，要它注意支持美英目前在近东的行动会有什么危险。
    历史事件证明，军事冒险的道路对冒险者来说是一条死路。
    常常可以听到西方国家、特别是英国方面说，它们在中近东的行动是由他们与近东石油的利害关系决定的。谈到这里，我想提一提，1956年在伦敦举行苏英谈判时，当时英国的首相艾登曾经声明说，英国考虑到石油对英国经济的意义，为了近东的石油它可以打仗。赫鲁晓夫当时提醒英国国家活动家们说，现在殖民主义的压迫和掠夺政策是不可想像的注定要失败的。当时向英国国家活动家们作了善意的劝告：不要对阿拉伯人发动战争，因为这必然会招致悲惨的后果，首先是对英国招致悲惨的后果。他们没有听取这个劝告，向埃及发动了侵略，结果像大家所知的，遭到了可耻的失败。
    1956年的事件证明，军事冒险的道路对冒险者来说是一条死路。现在我们又亲眼看到在近东发生了类似的事件。
    美国和英国是正当准备召开苏联建议的、目的在制止“冷战”和军备竞赛的高级会议的时候，正当苏联通过了具有历史意义的关于单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器的决定的时候，对黎巴嫩和约旦进行武装干涉的。因此人们不禁要问：美国和英国的领导人是否打算，他们两国对黎巴嫩和约旦采取的行动的结果之一，就是要破坏已经出现的、他们所不喜欢的国际局势好转的变化。
    苏联早就要求大国之间就不干涉中近东国家事务达成协议。
    在美英对近东的武装干涉使世界陷入危险境地的今天，可以特别明显地看出，结束危险的“实力地位”政策和以理智的态度来解决国际问题是非常必要的。如果大国能达成不干涉中近东国家内政和严格尊重它们的主权和领土完整的协议，那将是在这条道路上大大地向前迈进一步。苏联早就要求达成这种协议，因为它不仅符合维护世界和平的任务，而且我们觉得，最重要的是，从西方国家利益的观点来看当然也是有益的，因为这种协议将是西方国家同这一地区各国建立稳定的政治关系和经济关系的必要因素之一。
    我想提醒大会注意苏联政府早在1957年2月向美、英、法三国政府提出的建议。大家知道，苏联政府曾建议达成协议，由各大国政府在保证中近东的持久和平方面承担一定的义务。其中最重要的是：要求在谈判的基础上只通过和平的手段来解决迫切的问题，不干涉中近东国家的内政，尊重这些国家的主权和独立以及从它们的领土上撤退一切外国军队。
    谁能否认，由于目前中近东所发生的事件，这些建议有了更大的迫切意义呢。
    大国之间就不干涉中近东国家事务达成协议将是解决这一地区问题、从而有利于这一地区的人民和有利于和平的十分必要的前提。但是，要达到这一目的，当然必须打消使用武力解决问题的企图，这就必须停止侵略行动，首先必须从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出外国军队。为了巩固和平，必须用实际行动来证实自己的和平愿望，而不要仅仅在宣言中空谈希望和平。
    要恢复中近东和平，就必须使外国干涉军从阿拉伯东方立即无条件地全部撤退。
    美国军队和英国军队为什么要驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦呢？为什么要继续集结军队，把越来越多的军队和武器投向那里？所有这一切同美国政府和英国政府发表的爱好和平的宣言怎么联在一起呢。
    美国人和英国人当前的行动，甚至使那些从前在某种程度上喜欢缩小美国和英国对近东军事干涉的危险性的人，也开始正视现实情况。阿拉伯国家人民都在愤怒地要求撤出干涉者的军队。刚刚当选的黎巴嫩新总统在不久前的声明中也说到了这一点，他宣称，要外国军队撤出黎巴嫩是黎巴嫩的民族政策的主要任务。必须明白指出，要恢复中近东的和平，就必须使外国干涉军从阿拉伯东方立即无条件地全部撤退。这样做在目前尤其必要，因为目前有某种趋势，想用各种方法使外国军队留在黎巴嫩和约旦。不用说，使外国军队留在黎巴嫩和约旦是对联合国原则的嘲笑，是对联合国威信的严重打击。
    我们现在听到这样一种论调：外国军队应当留在中近东，直到所谓“秩序恢复”和“局势稳定”。没有必要详细说明，有些人企图把联合国推上的那条道路是多么危险。如果每个国家或是国家集团都自以为有权在别国推行合于自己心意的秩序，自命为公道主持者，那么在国际事务中就没有真理可言，就没有联合国的地位了，霸道和强权就会主宰国与国之间的关系。
    大家已经知道，美国政府装腔作势地打算从黎巴嫩撤退一营占领军，这一点是用不着多谈了。无需证明，这种舞台手法同采取实际措施来维护中近东和平和恢复被占领的阿拉伯国家的独立，是毫不相干的。把几十营军队派到别国的领土，然后大吹大擂地撤退一个营，企图这样以美国政府还有撤军的计划来安慰各国人民。
    美英谈论对中东的经济援助，是为了转移世界公众的视线。
    不能忽视另一个最近常常采取的手段。美国和英国官方人士为了转移世界公众对美英在近东国家领土上集结军队一事的视线，越来越频繁地声称，他们希望促进中近东国家的经济发展。我们从美国总统艾森豪威尔先生今天在我们联大讲坛上的发言中也听到了这种话。
    帮助中近东国家发展经济，自然是件好事情。苏联向来主张不附带任何政治或军事条件来提供这种援助，而且实际上也使自己同其他国家的关系建筑在双方完全平等和互利的原则上，同中近东国家的关系也是如此。
    美国总统在这里演说中所谈到的对中近东国家提供经济援助问题的主意，当然需要加以相应的研究。但是，首先应当解决一个主要的问题——外国军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退的问题。企图以谈论经济援助来转移大会的视线，使它不去注意解决这个主要问题，这是完全不能允许的。正因为如此，苏联最坚决地主张，从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退美国和英国军队问题必须立即解决，必须首先解决。
    苏联在中近东没有任何自私的目的，它所关心的是维护这个地区的和平和各国人民的独立。
    在美国、而后是英国对阿拉伯东方一开始进行武装干涉之后，苏联就立即要求联合国安全理事会采取最紧急的措施来制止侵略，保卫受到无端进攻的阿拉伯国家的民族独立。但是，安全理事会，由于它的大多数成员国都是军事集团的参加国，而这些军事集团的头目又恰恰是那些侵略近东的国家，所以没有能履行自己的义务。因此，苏联政府建议召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度五国政府首脑会议。但是，美国和英国政府却使得这个会议没有能开成。
    在这种情况下，苏联政府认为自己有责任把外国军队毫不拖延地从阿拉伯东方撤退和恢复这个地区的和平的问题提交联合国大会紧急会议讨论。
    苏联坚决要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，这是出于对维护普遍和平和各国人民安全利益的关怀。苏联在中近东没有任何自私的目的和秘密的利益。苏联在那边既没有一个士兵，也没有一个军事基地；既没有石油特权，也没有投资。很自然，苏联在近东所关心的就是：维护这个地区的持久和巩固的和平，保障这个地区的各国人民的自由和独立发展的可能性。我还想在这里着重指出另一点。苏联建议召开这一次联合国大会紧急会议，并且在会上要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，这不是为了要使我国同美英两国之间的关系尖锐化，或是使这两个国家的威信受到某种损失。我们也丝毫不想使这两个国家同阿拉伯东方国家的关系恶化。如果这种关系能在和平合作和充分尊重阿拉伯国家民族主权和独立的基础上顺利地发展，我们只有高兴。大家知道，苏联政府本身也在致力于同美国以及英国建立充分信任的良好关系，然而到目前为止这种关系还没有建立起来，这不是我们的过错。
    我们不是没有看到：不论是在美国或者是在英国都有人认为，华盛顿政府和伦敦政府在近东的行动实在走得太远了，以至于按照联合国的要求把军队撤离黎巴嫩和约旦就不能不影响到自己的威信。也许，这种看法在某种程度上是可以理解的，但是无论如何不能同意这种看法。如果美英两国政府真正愿意帮助寻求正确道路来解决当前的紧张局势和巩固和平，那末在全面权衡利弊以后，它们就会理解到，必须把自己的军队撤出中近东地区，这不仅不会影响到它们的威信，相反地，会使它们在世界公众心目中的威信大大增强。
    希望联大讨论使美英立即从黎约撤军的提案。
    代表先生们！
    召开这次联合国大会紧急特别会议所要讨论的问题，具有很大的重要意义。我们这个机构也许从来还没有过现在这样的机会来对维护世界和平的事业作出重要的贡献。
    苏联代表团受苏联政府的委托，已经将下列提案提交联合国大会紧急会议讨论：
    “关于美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队立即撤出约旦。
    大会，
    认为为了维护世界和平必须采取紧急措施来缓和中近东地区的紧张局势，
    特建议美国政府和英国政府毫不拖延地把军队从黎巴嫩和约旦的领土上撤出，
    责成联合国秘书长按照联合国驻黎巴嫩观察团第二次报告所提出的计划加强联合国驻黎巴嫩观察团，并派遣一个观察团到约旦去，以便监督美国军队和英国军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出和这两个国家的边境情况”。
    苏联代表团提出这个提案，相信联合国大会会以应有的注意和责任心来讨论这个提案。我认为，如果我们说联合国绝大多数会员国主张外国军队撤出中近东，这是不会有错的。有一些人是公开地声明这一点，另一些人是畏缩地谈论，还有一些人几乎什么也没有讲，但事情并不因此而有所改变。
    大家知道，有许多联合国大会会议参加者正在寻找适当的方案，来提出关于要美英撤军的要求。当然，只要真的希望促进采取这种唯一正确的解决办法，那么方案是不难找到的。我们认为，苏联代表团的提案中就包含有适当的方案。这并不是说，我们拒绝寻找经过考虑其他代表团的意见后制定的彼此都能接受的方案，只要它符合主要的目的——外国军队毫不拖延地撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。我们愿意立刻就同任何一个代表团，其中包括美国和英国代表团，就起草联合国大会为了和平而可能通过的那种建设性决议，进行正式的和非正式的磋商。
    苏联政府希望，联合国大会紧急会议无愧地完成它所面临的、恢复中近东和平的任务。
    苏联同其他爱好和平的国家一样，今后将继续尽一切必要的努力来始终不渝地保卫和维护和平事业。苏联和中华人民共和国两国最近发表的苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和中华人民共和国主席毛泽东的会谈公报，就鲜明地表示了这种决心。
    出席这一次联大会议的苏联代表团所遵循的就是这些。如果我们大家对这次会议的结果抱着高度负责的精神，这次会议是可以很好地为和平事业服务的。
