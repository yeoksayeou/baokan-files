　　The Nation's Largest Oil Shale Mine
A vast oil shale mine, covering a total area of 2,000 square kilometers, has been discovered in the Beian region of northern Heilongjiang Province. According to a general survey by the Nenjiang Geological Team of the Heilongjiang Provincial Geological Bureau, the reserves of this mine are estimated at 120 billion tons. The ore body has a thickness of about 30 meters, with an oil content generally around 6%, and some as high as 8% to 10%. If a refinery complex with an annual output of one million tons is built, it can be mined for 3,300 years. This is currently the nation's largest oil shale mine.
　　This oil shale mine, due to its characteristics of shallow overburden and thick ore seams, is suitable for open-pit mining, which can greatly reduce production costs. At the same time, the Bin (Harbin) Qi (Qiqihar) Railway runs through this area, providing convenient transportation, and creating favorable conditions for mining and production.

　　全国最大的油母页岩矿
    黑龙江省北部的北安地区发现一个总面积达二千平方公里的巨大的油母页岩矿。据黑龙江省地质局嫩江地质队普查证明：这个矿的蕴藏量估计有一千二百亿吨。矿体厚度有三十公尺左右，含油率一般在6％，有的高达8％至10％。如果建成一个年产一百万吨的炼油联合企业，就可以开采三千三百年。这是目前全国最大的油母页岩矿。
    这个油母页岩矿由于具有地表薄、矿层厚的特点，适宜于露天开采，生产成本可以大大降低。同时，由于滨（哈尔滨）齐（齐齐哈尔）铁路横贯这个地区，交通方便，开采和生产都具有良好条件。
