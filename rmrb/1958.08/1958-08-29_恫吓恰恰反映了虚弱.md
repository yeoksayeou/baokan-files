　　Intimidation Precisely Reflects Weakness
    After reading the full text of the U.S. State Department's memorandum on non-recognition of our country, we once again clearly see the ugly faces of the Dulles clique!
    The old tune of the United States not recognizing our country has been sung for nearly ten years, and the curses and hostility towards New China have lasted for nearly ten years. But curses cannot change the facts. In the nearly ten years that the United States has not recognized us, this country has not only not "disappeared" from the earth as they subjectively hoped, but has become stronger and stronger. Today, our country is making great leaps forward in all aspects, and our people are living in the great era of "one day equals twenty years." Our slogan is "Let the high mountains bow their heads, and tell the rivers to make way!" No one can stop the giant of the East from leaping forward!
    The memorandum unreservedly states that not recognizing our country "is most in line with the interests of the United States and the free world" and that it "facilitates the United States in achieving its policy goals in the Far East"; if it were recognized, it "would seriously hinder the achievement of these goals."
    Naturally, recognition or non-recognition is America's own business, and we don't crave America's "recognition." But we will not let them do whatever they want just because America "doesn't recognize" us. We must "seriously hinder" U.S. imperialism from achieving its goals of aggression. In the past, we have already "seriously hindered" U.S. imperialism from achieving its goal of aggression in Korea; today, we are once again working with peace-loving people from all countries to "seriously hinder" the United States from achieving its goals of aggression against Arab countries. It will never be possible for the Chinese people not to "hinder" the United States from achieving its goals of aggression. The U.S. "non-recognition" policy cannot scare the Chinese people; on the contrary, it reflects that U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly weaker!

### 恫吓恰恰反映了虚弱

　　恫吓恰恰反映了虚弱
    读了美国国务院关于不承认我国的备忘录全文，我们再一次看清了杜勒斯之流的丑恶的嘴脸！
    美国不承认我国的老调唱了将近十年了，诅咒和敌视新中国将近十年了。可是诅咒并不能改变事实。将近十年来，美国所不承认的这个国家，不仅没有像他们所主观希望地那样从地球上“消逝了”，而且是愈长愈强。今天，我们的国家各方面都在大跃进，我们的人民正生活在“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代。我们的口号是“让高山低头，叫河水让路！”任何人也阻挡不住这个东方巨人飞跃前进的脚步！
    这个备忘录中毫不掩饰地说，不承认我国“是最符合美国和自由世界的利益的”，而且“便于美国达到在远东的政策目标”；如果承认了的话，“就会严重地妨碍达到这些目标。”
    自然，承认或不承认是美国自己的事情，我们并不希罕美国的“承认”。可是我们也不会因为美国的“不承认”而就让它为所欲为。我们一定要“严重地妨碍”美帝国主义达到它的侵略目标。过去，我们已经“严重地妨碍”过美帝国主义达到侵略朝鲜的目标；今天，我们又同爱好和平的各国人民一起“严重地妨碍”着美国达到侵略阿拉伯国家的目标。要中国人民不“妨碍”美国达到它的侵略目标，那是永远不可能的。美国的“不承认”政策并不能吓倒中国人民，恰恰相反，正反映了美帝国主义自己越来越加虚弱了！
