The Ant's Dairy Cow
Wei Cheng

Humans raise dairy cows to obtain milk for consumption; but strangely enough, the tiny ant actually raises "dairy cows" as well.

The ant's "dairy cow" is a beetle, or the larva of a beetle.

There is a kind of small red beetle that is often hunted alive into the ant nest to become the ant's "dairy cow." The beetle's abdomen has many golden yellow hairs, gathered into hair-like protrusions, and these protrusions are its "nipples." The hairs surround the openings of many glands, and the glands secrete a kind of sweet and sour liquid - the ant's "milk." The "milk" is very much to the ants' liking, so those gluttonous ants always scramble to drill under the beetle's belly, desperately sucking those fresh and delicious "milk." The larvae of beetles can also release a fatty "milk" for the ants to enjoy. However, the ants do not eat for free. When they drink "milk," they vomit the food in their stomachs as feed for the "dairy cows."

The ant's emphasis on "animal husbandry" is truly astonishing - they regard beetles as more important than their own offspring. In order to obtain delicious "milk," worker ants spare no effort to nurture, care for, and guard the beetles, so that their own larvae do not get food and the care they deserve and die in large numbers. Even when fleeing under the strong attack of alien ant colonies, they must first transport the precious "dairy cow" herd to a safe area before transporting their own larvae.

If the number of "dairy cows" increases too much, it may put the entire nest of gluttons in danger of extinction. Because there are too many beetles, the worker ants, in order to eat, have no time to take care of the larvae, and even the larvae that are about to grow into queen ants are not spared; the queen ant larvae will simply die, or be transformed into worker ants. Without queen ants, there is no possibility of reproduction, which is tantamount to sentencing the entire ant nest to death. Of course, this is still extremely rare.

    蚂蚁的乳牛
    伟成
    人类养乳牛，获得牛奶，供食用；但奇怪的是：小小蚁儿竟也养起“乳牛”来。
    蚂蚁的“乳牛”，就是甲虫，或者是甲虫的幼虫。
    有一种红色小甲虫，常被活生生的猎进蚁巢内，成为蚂蚁的“乳牛”。甲虫腹部，长有很多金黄色纤毛，集成毛状突起，这些突起就是它的“乳头”。纤毛围住许多腺的出口，腺分泌一种酸甜的液汁——蚁的“牛奶”。“奶汁”很合蚁儿们口味，所以那批贪馋的蚂蚁总是争先恐后地往甲虫肚下钻，拼命吮吸那些鲜美可口的“牛奶”。甲虫们的幼虫也能放出一种脂肪性“乳”，供蚁们享用。但是，蚂蚁们并不是白吃的。它们喝“牛奶”时，就会呕出肚里的食物，作为“乳牛”的饲料。
    蚂蚁对“畜牧”业的重视实在惊人——它们视甲虫比自己的子孙更重要。工蚁们为了得到美味的“牛奶”，不惜全力来哺育、照顾和看守甲虫们，以致自己的幼虫得不到食物和应有的照看而大量死亡。甚至，在异种蚁群强攻下而逃跑时，都要先把宝贵的“乳牛”群运到安全地带，然后才运送自己的幼虫。
    由于“乳牛”增加过多，可能使整穴贪吃者遭到灭族的危险。因为甲虫过多，工蚁为了吃，再无暇顾及幼虫，甚至要长成为后蚁的幼虫也不能幸免，后蚁幼虫就会干脆死亡，或转化成工蚁。没有了后蚁，没有生育的可能，就等于对整巢蚂蚁宣判了死刑。当然这还是极少见的。
