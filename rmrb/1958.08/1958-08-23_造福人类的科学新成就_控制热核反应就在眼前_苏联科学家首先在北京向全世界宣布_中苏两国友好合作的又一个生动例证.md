　　New Scientific Achievement to Benefit Mankind
    Controlling Thermonuclear Reaction is Just Around the Corner
    Soviet Scientists First Announced to the World in Beijing
    Another Vivid Example of Friendly Cooperation Between China and the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - The Soviet Union has found a new way in the research of peaceful utilization of thermonuclear reactions. The "Ogla" device now in use is superior to the previously used strong current pulse discharge method and is more likely to be realized. This means that the hydrogen bomb, which threatens the lives of hundreds of millions of people—an explosive thermonuclear reaction—can be transformed into a tool to benefit mankind—a controllable and stable thermonuclear reaction; mankind will obtain an unprecedented and inexhaustible source of power from this. Because the "heavy hydrogen" used for controllable thermonuclear reactions exists in large quantities in natural water, this fuel is sufficient for mankind to use for tens of thousands of years.
    Academician Kurchatov, Director of the Atomic Energy Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the leader of the controllable thermonuclear reaction research work, in order to express the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, he first announced this new scientific achievement sufficient to excite all mankind in China. On the 20th of this month, Comrade Vorobyov, entrusted by his teacher Academician Kurchatov, read Kurchatov's report on this research achievement at a special academic report meeting held at the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
    This report described in detail the "Ogla" device, which had never been published before, built in the Atomic Energy Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Its principle is to use the adiabatic trap proposed by Potter. After injecting hydrogen ions in the molecular state pre-accelerated to 200,000 electron volts into the trap, they are dissociated into atomic state ions in the trap. Then, these high-temperature ions oscillate back and forth between the two "magnetic plugs" of the trap until they collide with each other and react. Since there is no large current passing through the plasma gas of the adiabatic trap, its stability is relatively high. Therefore, it is promising to solve the problem of controllable thermonuclear reaction in this direction. In addition, this method can also solve the problem of realizing stationary thermonuclear reactions. The "Ogla" device is the largest thermonuclear reaction device published in the literature so far. Its magnetic field coil alone requires 4,000 kilowatts of electric power, and the total length of the vacuum chamber is 20 meters. This set of equipment has been installed and is now starting experimental work.
    More than 300 scientific and technical workers from relevant institutes, universities, and industrial departments in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences attended the report meeting. Vice Presidents of the Academy of Sciences Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, famous scientists Qian Xuesen, Zhao Zhongyao, Shi Ruwei, Peng Huanwu, Zhang Wenyu, Guo Yonghuan, Rao Yutai, Wang Zhuxi and others participated in the report meeting. The audience listened to the three-hour report with great interest.
    Qian Sanqiang, director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, thanked the reporter on behalf of President Guo Moruo and the attendees, and extended warm congratulations to Academician Kurchatov and the scientific and technical personnel of the Atomic Energy Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences who participated in this important work, congratulating the Soviet scientists on achieving new achievements in scientific research related to the happy future of all mankind in controllable thermonuclear reactions. Qian Sanqiang emphasized that the fact that Soviet scientists reported important work that had not yet been completed in China before announcing it to the world is another concrete manifestation of the further development of the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between the scientific circles of the two countries. It has given great encouragement and inspiration to Chinese scientific and technological workers in realizing the glorious tasks of the technological revolution and cultural revolution proposed by the Party.

### 造福人类的科学新成就  控制热核反应就在眼前  苏联科学家首先在北京向全世界宣布  中苏两国友好合作的又一个生动例证

　　造福人类的科学新成就
    控制热核反应就在眼前
    苏联科学家首先在北京向全世界宣布
    中苏两国友好合作的又一个生动例证
    新华社22日讯　苏联研究和平利用热核反应方面又找出了一个新的途径。现在采用的“奥格拉”装置比过去用的强电流脉冲放电方法更优越，更有实现的可能。这就是说，威胁着亿万人民生命安全的氢弹——爆炸式的热核反应，将可以改变为造福人类的工具——可以控制的、平稳地进行热核反应；人类将从这里获得空前巨大的取之不尽的动力源泉。因为用于可控制热核反应的“重氢”，在自然界水中大量存在，这种燃料足够人类用几万万年。
    可控制热核反应研究工作的主持者、苏联科学院原子能研究所长库尔恰托夫院士为了表示中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，他要首先在中国宣布这项足以震奋全人类的科学新成就。本月20日，伏罗别尧夫同志接受他的老师库尔恰托夫院士的委托，在北京中国科学院原子能研究所特地举行的学术报告会上宣读了库尔恰托夫关于这项研究成果的报告。
    这篇报告详细描写了过去从未公布过的，建造在苏联科学院原子能研究所内的“奥格拉”装置。它的原理是利用蒲特开尔提出的绝热捕集器。把预先加速到二十万电子伏的分子态氢离子注入捕集器后，在捕集器中解离为原子态离子，然后这样高温的离子就在捕集器的两个“磁塞”之间来回振动，直到相互碰撞发生反应为止。由于绝热捕集器的等离子气体中没有大电流通过，所以它的稳定性较高。因此，按这个方向解决可控制热核反应的问题是有前途的。此外，这个方法还可以解决实现驻定状态的热核反应的问题。“奥格拉”装置是到目前为止文献上已发表的热核反应装置中最大的一个，单是它的磁场线圈就需要四千瓩的电功率，真空室的总长达二十米。这套装置已经安装完毕，现正在开始进行实验工作。
    出席报告会的有中国科学院北京地区各有关研究所，高等学校以及工业部门的科学技术工作者三百余人。科学院副院长竺可桢，吴有训，著名科学家钱学森、赵忠尧、施汝为、彭桓武、张文裕、郭永桓、饶毓泰、王竹溪等都参加了报告会。听众以极大兴趣听完了这三小时的报告。
    中国科学院原子能研究所所长钱三强代表郭沫若院长及到会者向报告人致谢，并通过报告人向库尔恰托夫院士和苏联科学院原子能研究所参加这项重要工作的科学技术人员致以热烈祝贺，祝贺苏联科学家们在可控制热核反应这样一项关系全人类幸福前途的科学研究工作中取得崭新的成就。钱三强强调地说，这次苏联科学家将尚未完毕的重要工作在向全世界公布之前首先在中国报告，是中苏两国人民间的伟大友谊和两国科学界互助合作关系进一步发展的又一次具体表现。它对中国科学技术工作者为实现党所提出的技术革命和文化革命的光荣任务给了很大的鼓舞和启发。（附图片）
