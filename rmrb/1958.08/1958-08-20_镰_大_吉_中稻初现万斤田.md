　　Early Mid-Season Rice Shows Fields Yielding 10,000 Jin
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th: More than 27 million mu of mid-season rice in Anhui Province has begun to be harvested, and three mid-season rice "satellites" with yields of over 10,000 jin per mu have already appeared. Guanzhen Cooperative in Guanzhen Township, Wuwei County, harvested 1.04 mu of mid-season rice and actually received 21,514.5 jin of dry grain, averaging 20,687 jin per mu; Yipin Cooperative in Huhe Township, Wuwei County, harvested 1.25 mu of mid-season rice, receiving a total of 15,450.5 jin of dry grain, averaging 12,360 jin per mu; Jianguang Cooperative in Changlin Township, Feidong County, harvested 1.61 mu of mid-season rice, receiving a total of 18,421.5 jin of dry grain, averaging 11,441 jin per mu. When these three high-yielding mid-season rice fields were harvested, the local Party and government leadership departments sent people to supervise the threshing and harvesting.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 19th: Hunan Province has just begun harvesting mid-season rice for a few days, and the yield per mu has already broken through the 10,000 jin mark. This breakthrough was made by the 16th Production Team of the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Mingshantou Township, Nanxian County. The 1.146 mu mid-season rice experimental field jointly cultivated by the team leader Huang Mingjiang, deputy leader Liu Baishu, women's captain Xiao Aiying, militia captain Gan Chengxiang, and old farmer Zeng Baosheng, harvested a total of 13,422 jin of dry grain, averaging 11,712 jin of dry grain per mu. On August 14th, it was verified as true by the county Party committee acceptance team, county, township, cooperative cadres, and more than 40 people from the masses.

This field originally had very shallow mud and the mid-season rice yield was generally only 200-300 jin. This year, it began as an experimental field and, after careful cultivation and application of large amounts of fertilizer, achieved a harvest of over 10,000 jin.

    Anhui Guanzhen Cooperative 1.04 mu yielded 20,687 jin per mu
    Anhui Yipin Cooperative 1.25 mu yielded 12,360 jin per mu
    Hunan Wuyi Cooperative 1.14 mu yielded 11,712 jin per mu
    Anhui Jianguang Cooperative 1.61 mu yielded 11,441 jin per mu

　　中稻初现万斤田
    新华社合肥19日电  安徽省二千七百多万亩中稻已开镰收割，现已出现了三个亩产万斤以上的中稻
  “卫星”。无为县官镇乡官镇社收割一亩零四厘中稻，实收干谷二万一千五百一十四点五斤，平均亩产二万零六百八十七斤；无为县护河乡一嫔社收割一亩二分五厘中稻，共收干谷一万五千四百五十点五斤，平均亩产一万二千三百六十斤；肥东县长临乡建光社收割一亩六分一厘中稻，共收干谷一万八千四百二十一点五斤，平均亩产一万一千四百四十一斤。这三块高额丰产中稻田，在收割时都有当地党政领导部门派人监打监收。
    据新华社长沙19日电  湖南省刚开始收割中稻不几天，中稻亩产量就突破了万斤大关。这是南县明山头乡五一农业社第十六生产队突破的。这个队的队长黄明江、副队长刘柏树、妇女队长萧爱英、民兵队长甘城香、老农曾保生等共同种的一点一四六亩中稻试验田共收干谷一万三千四百二十二斤，平均每亩产干谷一万一千七百一十二斤。8月14日经县委验收工作组、县、乡、社干部和群众四十余人验收证明属实。
    这丘田原来泥脚很浅，中稻产量一般只有二百——三百斤。今年开始作试验田，经过精耕细作和大量施肥，获得了万斤以上的收成。
    安徽官镇社1.04亩亩产20687斤
    安徽一嫔社1.25亩亩产12360斤
    湖南五一社1.14亩亩产11712斤
    安徽建光社1.61亩亩产11441斤
