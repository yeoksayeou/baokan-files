A New Victory for the Mass Line
Li Yan

　　Reading the report "Mass Line Extensively Used in Public Security Work" is truly inspiring! This is a new development in fully utilizing the mass line in public security work, and also a new victory for the Party's mass line. Who could have imagined that the Party's mass line could blossom into such a remarkable flower and bear such abundant fruit in investigative work, which was once considered very mysterious by many?

　　One of the most valuable experiences of the rectification movement is to implement the Party's mass line in all our work; organizing mass movements through extensive airing of views, big-character posters, major debates is the most effective way to implement the mass line. This is true in rural areas, factories, government agencies, and schools. So, can this be done in investigative work in public security? Won't it cause chaos if we do so? The abundant and eloquent facts in the report are enough to dispel such doubts. Adopting the method of mass movement for investigation and solving cases not only won't cause chaos, but will also produce excellent results: in Shijiazhuang, old and new cases in three districts were swept away in half a month; in Jinan, a difficult case that had remained unsolved for two years was solved in one day. This is the most undeniable proof.

　　Perhaps some may ask: Why is this so?

　　There is a popular saying among the masses in our country: "If you don't want others to know, don't do it." The "others" here refer to the broad masses, and the "you" refers to those who do evil. This saying is the crystallization of the people's experience over many years, and it fully embodies a truth: any bad person or bad deed cannot escape the eyes of the people. Moreover, any criminal's criminal behavior directly or indirectly harms the interests of the masses, and the contradiction between the masses and criminals is an antagonistic contradiction. Therefore, the broad masses not only have the unlimited ability to identify criminals, but also have the urgent desire to eliminate them. This is the basis on which we can fully rely on the masses and organize mass movements in investigative work. As long as the masses are fully mobilized, the limited number of public security personnel will become countless public security personnel; the limited investigative eyes and ears will become infinite investigative eyes and ears. In this way, difficult cases will no longer be difficult, and headless cases will also have heads. It is only natural. At the same time, the masses will further receive education in revolutionary vigilance by participating in investigative work, and they will further increase their ability to identify criminals. In this way, criminals' criminal activities will become more and more difficult, and solving cases after crimes will become easier and easier.

　　Of course, the basic situation of social security in our country is that there are not many counter-revolutionaries, and various criminals are also decreasing. However, since there are counter-revolutionaries and criminals, we must use the most effective methods to eliminate them, and this requires mobilizing the broad masses to participate in the struggle of investigation and solving cases.

　　Moreover, mobilizing the masses to participate in public security work not only has practical needs, but also has the significance of training the masses' ability to manage and maintain social security. In his book "State and Revolution," Lenin talked about the security situation in a communist society where class struggle has been eliminated and the police no longer exist. He once said that although there would be no class struggle at that time, "we are not utopian socialists, and we do not in the least deny the possibility and inevitability of excesses on the part of individual persons, or the need to suppress such excesses." He then said: "No special machine, no special apparatus of repression is needed for this; this will be done by the armed people themselves, as simply and as readily as any crowd of civilised people, even in modern society, parts a pair of combatants or does not allow a woman to be outraged." This means that in communist society, the functions of the current public security organs and people's police will be performed by the people themselves. Therefore, allowing the masses to participate in public security work can also be said to be a kind of communist education for the masses in practice.

　　Applying the Party's mass line to the struggle of investigating the enemy and protecting the people is like casting a dragnet over criminals. With this dragnet, no criminal can escape between heaven and earth.

### 群众路线的新胜利

　　群众路线的新胜利
　　黎言
    读了“公安工作大走群众路线”的报道，真是令人振奋！这是公安工作中充分运用群众路线的新发展，也是党的群众路线的新胜利。谁能设想，在曾经被不少人看得很神秘的侦察破案工作中，党的群众路线也能开出这样的奇花，结出这样的硕果呢？
    整风运动给我们最宝贵的经验之一，就是要在一切工作中贯彻党的群众路线；通过大鸣大放大争大辩组织群众运动，则是贯彻群众路线的最有效的方法。农村是这样，工厂是这样，机关、学校是这样。那么，公安工作中的侦察破案能不能这样呢？如果这样会不会搞乱呢？报道中大量雄辩的事实，已经足够打破这种怀疑。采取群众运动的办法进行侦察破案，不但不会搞乱，而且会搞得出色的好：石家庄有三个区的新旧案件，半个月就一扫而光；济南市有一个两年未破的疑难案，一天就破了。这就是最不容怀疑的证明。
    也许有人会问：为什么会这样呢？
    我国群众中流行着一句话：“若要人不知，除非己莫为”。这里的“人”就是广大群众，这里的“己”就是为非作歹的分子。这句话是人民群众多少年来经验的结晶，它充分体现了一个真理：任何坏人坏事总逃不出人民群众的眼睛。而且，任何罪犯的犯罪行为，都在直接、间接地危害着群众的利益，群众同罪犯之间的矛盾是敌我矛盾，因此，广大群众不仅有识别罪犯的无限能力，而且也有清除罪犯的迫切要求。这就是我们能够在侦察破案工作中充分依靠群众和组织群众运动的根据。只要把群众充分发动起来，有数的公安人员，就会变成无数的公安人员；有限的侦察耳目，就会变成无限的侦察耳目，这样，疑难案件不再疑难，无头案件也有了头，是极自然的事。同时，群众在参加侦察破案中会进一步受到革命警惕性的教育，也就会进一步增加他们识别罪犯的本领。这样，罪犯的犯罪活动就会愈来愈困难，犯罪以后破案也会愈来愈容易。
    当然，我国目前社会治安的基本情况是：反革命分子不多了，各种犯罪分子也在减少，但是，既然有反革命分子和犯罪分子，我们就要用最有效的方法肃清他们，这就不能不发动广大群众参加到侦察破案的斗争中来。
    而且，发动群众参加公安工作，不但有现实需要，也有锻炼群众管理和维持社会治安能力的意义。列宁在“国家与革命”一书中谈到阶级斗争已经消灭，警察已不存在的共产主义社会的治安情况时，曾经说过：虽然那时候阶级斗争没有了，但是“我们不是空想社会主义者，我们丝毫也不否认个别人捣乱的可能性和必然性，同样也不否认有镇压这种捣乱的必要性。”接着又说：“做这件事情用不着什么特别的镇压机器，特别的镇压机关，武装的人民自己会来做这项工作，而且做起来非常容易。”这就是说，到了共产主义社会，现在的公安机关和人民警察的职能，将由人民群众自己来执行。因此，让群众参加公安工作，也可以说是在实践中对群众的一种共产主义教育。
    把党的群众路线运用到侦察敌人保卫人民的斗争中，这就等于给罪犯撒下了一个天罗地网，有了这个天罗地网，任何罪犯都不能逃脱于天地之间。
