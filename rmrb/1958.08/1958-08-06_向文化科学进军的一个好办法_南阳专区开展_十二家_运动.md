    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 5th: The Nanyang Special District in Henan Province has 1.5 million people participating in the "Twelve Experts" movement to advance towards cultural science. These twelve "experts" are novelists, playwrights (Zhui Zi performers), poetry and快板 artists, painters, folk musicians, folk storytellers, folk dancers, journalists, musicians, athletes, academics, and inventors. Through this activity, 300,000 talented farmers and citizens have already been recommended by the masses as their own red experts.
    The Nanyang Special District's widespread and in-depth cultural and scientific movement was launched under the great leap forward situation in the entire district after the popularization of primary and secondary school education and the elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. The "Twelve Experts" movement first appeared in Chengguan Town, Fangcheng County, in this district. Within a few days, this town saw the emergence of hundreds of creation groups, storytelling groups, music and sports groups, theatrical troupes, clubs, etc., with the number of participants surging from 300 to 4,000. A large number of outstanding writers, painters, and inventors emerged. In June, the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting here. The Prefectural Committee pointed out that this activity can not only rapidly cultivate a strong Party propaganda team, but more importantly, it can enable the proletarian intellectual ranks to grow rapidly. Currently, this movement has been widely carried out in twelve counties and cities throughout the district.
    The first to participate in this movement were the Party's propagandists on all fronts. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, they established their own organizations, and in some places, they also established writers' associations, music associations, etc., and carried out large-scale propaganda activities related to the general line and crop harvests. They wrote thousands of scripts, thousands of novels, hundreds of thousands of快板 poems, and a large number of short literary and artistic works. Hundreds of amateur theatrical troupes in the entire special district are vying to stage scripts written by their own writers. People determined to become journalists have founded 400 kinds of small newspapers throughout the special district.
    Among this million-strong army, there is a 73-year-old woman, Gao Xiuying, who has written six large volumes of diaries for more than a year, each recording a good deed done by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. This old lady has been hired as a special correspondent for the Nanyang Daily, and her diary will be published in the Nanyang Daily.

    向文化科学进军的一个好办法
    南阳专区开展“十二家”运动
    据新华社郑州5日电　河南省南阳专区有一百五十万群众参加了向文化科学进军的“十二家”运动。这十二家是小说家、编剧家（坠子）、诗歌快板家、画家、民间乐器家、民间说唱家、民间舞蹈家、新闻记者、音乐家、体育家、学术家、发明创造家。通过这个活动，已经有三十万有才能的农民和市民被群众推荐为自己的红色专家。
    南阳专区这个广泛深入的文化科学运动，是在全区大跃进形势下普及了中小学教育、扫除了青壮年文盲的条件下开展起来的。“十二家”运动首先出现在这个区的方城县城关镇。这个镇曾在几天内出现了几百个创作组、说唱组、音乐体育组、剧团、俱乐部等，参加的人数由三百人激增到四千。涌现出大批优秀的作家、画家、创造发明家。中共南阳地委6月间在这里召开了现场会议，地委指出：通过这个活动不仅可以迅速培养一支党的强大的宣传队伍，更重要的是可以使无产阶级知识分子队伍迅速地成长起来。目前，这个运动已在全区十二个县市广泛开展。
    最先参加这个运动的是各个战线上的党的宣传员。他们在当地党委的领导下成立了自己的组织，有些地方还成立了作家协会、音乐协会等，开展了声势浩大的有关总路线、农作物丰收的宣传活动。他们写出了上千个剧本、几千篇小说、几十万首快板诗歌和大批短小文艺作品。全专区几百个乡社业余剧团都争先恐后地上演自己的作家写的剧本。立志当新闻记者的人在全专区创办了四百种小报。
    在这支百万大军中，有一位七十三岁的老太太高秀英她写了一年多的六大本日记，每一篇都记下了共产党和毛主席的一件好事。这位老太太已被聘请为南阳日报特约通讯员，她的日记将在南阳日报发表。
