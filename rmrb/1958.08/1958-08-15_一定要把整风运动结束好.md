　　Be Sure to End the Rectification Movement Well
　　By a Commentator of this Newspaper

　　Recently, the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs put forward a requirement to its subordinate units to end the rectification movement well. This requirement was put forward very timely, as the rectification movement in the central government organs is now underway to conclude. The rectification movement in state organs throughout the country is also like this. Taking this opportunity, this newspaper would like to say a few words about the issue of ending the rectification movement.
　　Ending the rectification movement may not seem like a very important matter to many people, at least not a very difficult one. Isn't it enough to hold a conference where leading comrades talk about the gains of the rectification movement over the past year? Of course, things are not that simple! For revolutionary work, the end is also the beginning, and the end is for the next step of work. We are believers in continuous revolution, advocating one revolutionary struggle after another. When carrying out the first revolutionary struggle, we must prepare for the second revolutionary struggle. This means determining the direction and method of the next revolutionary struggle from the first revolutionary struggle. We often say that leaders should have foresight. Foresight of what? First of all, to foresee the direction and method of the next revolutionary struggle. Where does foresight come from? It comes from practice, from summarizing the experiences of the current revolutionary struggle. It cannot be imagined while sitting in the office. Past historical facts have also proven this. For example, the land reform struggle we conducted in the past was by no means solely for land reform; it also prepared conditions for the next socialist transformation of agriculture. Failure to understand this dialectical relationship between ending and beginning will lead to neglecting the ending work, hastily carrying out the ending work, and, more importantly, losing sight of the direction of progress.
　　Everyone knows, what is the purpose of our rectification movement? It is to correct the political direction, raise the level of ideological understanding, correct shortcomings in work, unite the broad masses, and isolate and disintegrate bourgeois rightists and all anti-socialist elements. After a year of rectification, this goal has been initially achieved. Relationships among people have improved, people's minds have been liberated, and the leap forward in socialist construction has been promoted. But this is only the beginning, and greater victories are yet to come. In order to win greater victories, we must end the rectification movement better.
　　How to end it well? One is to strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement, and the other is to summarize the experiences of the rectification movement and adhere to these experiences in the next revolutionary movement.
　　To strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement, judging from the current situation, the key does not lie in the general cadres, but in thoroughly resolving the unresolved problems among a few leading cadres. Among these leading cadres, some had some problems exposed in the past, but because the rectification movement was not deep enough at the time, the problems were not fully exposed; others knew that the problems were relatively serious, but because the masses had not been fully mobilized, the time to solve the problems had not matured. According to the situation checked out by a few units of the central government organs, some leading cadres of some units have had uncoordinated and ununited relationships for a long time due to different views on some major issues; individual leading cadres of some units have serious individualism; and some leading cadres still have serious right-leaning opportunist errors. The leading organs must not adopt a compromising attitude towards the problems of these leading cadres, but must thoroughly resolve them. If the problems of these people are not resolved, the rectification movement cannot be considered a complete victory, and the leap forward situation cannot appear. There are also some leading cadres who, because they are the leaders of the rectification movement, did not have the opportunity to conduct in-depth self-examination and criticism in the past. After the problems of the general people are largely resolved, they have the conditions to examine, criticize, and resolve their own problems. Although the problems of these people are not big, it is still a loss to the Party and to themselves if they are not examined, criticized, and resolved. These people's problems are often considered to be small things; and they are often not noticed to be resolved. It should be known that the small things of leading cadres are also big things. Leading cadres are the head of the organs, the head of the work of the organs. If the head has problems, even small problems, it will affect the healthy development of the staff and work of the organs. In the past, many organs did not work well, was it not primarily because the head had problems? Now, the reason why a lively and vigorous political situation has emerged in many organs, with both concentration and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and personal ease of mind, as well as a great leap forward situation in the technical revolution and cultural revolution, is also primarily because the working style and working methods of the head have been improved.
　　Units that have already achieved a complete victory in the rectification movement should conscientiously summarize the experiences of the rectification movement. The experiences of this rectification movement are very rich. To illustrate the importance of summarizing the experiences of the rectification movement, we will say a few words.
　　Combining the abstract with the concrete, and using the abstract to lead the concrete, is a very important experience in this rectification movement. In the past, for a considerable period of time, many leading organs and leading cadres were only concerned with the concrete and not the abstract, only concerned with business and not politics. Because of this, they could not distinguish between the mainstream and the tributaries, the essence and the phenomenon, the east wind and the west wind, the red flag and the white flag on many major issues. As a result, many political errors occurred. After this rectification movement, not only was the rectification movement itself a large-scale abstract movement, but it also advocated using the abstract to lead the concrete and combining the abstract with the concrete in the rectification movement, and criticized the tendency of only being concerned with the concrete and not the abstract, only asking about business and not politics, which made everyone realize the importance of using the abstract to lead the concrete and combining the abstract with the concrete, and they all paid attention to the abstract. In this way, politics took command, the red flag of thought was planted, the direction could be distinguished when the wind came, and the working methods were correct. As a result, problems that had not been clarified for a long time were clarified, and problems that had not been solved for a long time were solved, and solved very well. Shouldn't such good experiences be summarized? Shouldn't it be implemented in future work? Can the tendency of only being concerned with the concrete and not the abstract, only asking about business and not politics be allowed to appear in future work? Of course not.
　　This rectification movement, the working methods of the mass movement of great airing of views, great contending, great debate, and big-character posters, have given us a very deep education. After adopting this method, many problems that were difficult to expose were exposed, many problems that were difficult to solve were solved, and many problems that were difficult to solve well were solved well. More importantly, applying this working method to daily work has created a new situation. In the first half of the year, we combined the rectification movement with the whole people to educate the masses on the general line of socialism, and adopted this mass movement method that suits the current needs of the masses, immediately setting off a great leap forward situation of ten thousand horses galloping and breaking through obstacles. Within half a year, we have newly built more than 300,000 local industrial units, and the output of our summer grain and early rice has increased by 84 billion catties compared to last year. Elementary school education has been popularized in 1,240 counties across the country, and illiteracy has been basically eliminated in 444 counties. These are things that have not been done in the past few decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years. Shouldn't this experience be summarized? Shouldn't it be implemented in the next movement?
　　The methods of summarizing experience can be various. But one thing is common, that is, to adopt the method of mass movement. The "100 Articles Movement" launched by the General Office of the State Council is one of the methods of summarizing the experience of rectification using the method of mass movement. They mobilized everyone to write about the experience of rectification, some writing about the experience of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate, some writing about the experience of red-expert debates, some writing about the experience of heart-to-heart talks, some writing about the experience of big-character posters, some writing about the experience of the anti-rightist struggle.... Some are based on one person's and one thing's experience and summarized, and some are several people working together to summarize the collective experience of a unit. This will absorb the majority of people into the movement of summarizing experience. It can not only deepen the masses' understanding of the experience of rectification, but also give the leadership's comprehensive summary a broader mass base, and it is also a way to summarize experience quickly, well, and economically.
　　Ending work is the last major event of the rectification movement. At the beginning of the rectification movement, we asked everyone to boldly release, resolutely release, and thoroughly release, and to boldly change, resolutely change, and thoroughly change. Now we want to put forward a new requirement to everyone: everyone should end the rectification movement well and prepare for the next movement!

### 一定要把整风运动结束好

　　一定要把整风运动结束好
　　本报评论员
    最近，中央国家机关党委会向各所属单位提出了把整风运动结束好的要求。这个要求提得非常适时，中央国家机关的整风运动正在着手结束。全国各地国家机关的整风运动也是这样。本报借这个机会，对于结束整风运动的问题说一点意见。
    结束整风运动这件事，可能在许多人看来并不是一件很重要的事情，至少不是一件很难办的事情，召开一个大会，由领导同志讲一下一年来的整风运动的收获，不就结束了吗？事情当然不是这样简单！对于革命工作来说，结束也是开始，结束是为了下一步的工作。我们是不断革命论者，主张一个革命斗争接着一个革命斗争，在进行第一个革命斗争的时候，就要为第二个革命斗争作好准备工作。这就是要从第一个革命斗争中，确定下一个革命斗争的方向和方法问题。我们常说领导者要有预见。预见什么呢？首先要预见下一个革命斗争的方向和方法问题。预见从哪里来呢？从实践中来，从总结当前的革命斗争经验中来。而不是坐在办公室里可以空想出来的。过去的历史事实，也是这样证明着的。例如我们过去所进行的土地改革斗争，决不是仅仅为了土地改革，它同时为了下一个农业社会主义改造准备条件。不了解结束和开始的这种辩证关系，就会忽视结束工作、就会草草进行结束工作，更重要的，就会迷失前进的方向。
    谁都知道，我们的整风运动目的是什么？是端正政治方向，提高思想水平，改正工作缺点，团结广大群众，孤立和分化资产阶级右派和一切反社会主义的分子。经过一年来的整风运动，初步达到了这个目的，人们的关系改善了，人们的思想解放了，推动了社会主义建设飞跃前进。但这仅仅是开始，更大的胜利还在今后。为了争取更大的胜利，我们就要把整风运动结束得更好。
    如何结束得好呢？一个是一定要争取整风运动的全胜，一个是一定要总结整风运动的经验，把这些经验坚持到下一个革命运动中去。
    要争取整风运动全胜，从目前情况来看，关键不在于一般干部，而在于彻底解决少数领导干部中的尚未解决的问题。在这些领导干部中，有的是过去已经揭发了一些问题，当时因为整风运动还不深入，问题没有全部揭发出来，有的是过去也知道问题比较严重，当时因为还没把群众充分发动起来，解决问题的时机没有成熟。据中央国家机关少数单位检查出来的情况看来，有的单位的领导干部由于对一些重大问题有着不同的看法，长期间在关系上不协调不团结；有的单位的个别领导干部，存在着严重的个人主义；有的领导干部还有严重的右倾机会主义错误。对于这些领导干部的问题，领导机关决不能采取姑息迁就的态度，必须加以彻底解决。这些人的问题不解决，整风运动就不能算全胜，大跃进形势就不能出现。也有的领导干部因为是整风运动的领导者，过去没有机会对自己进行深入的检查批判，在一般人的问题大体解决之后，就有条件来检查、批判和解决自己的问题了。这些人的问题虽然不大，但是不检查不批判不解决，同样是对党对自己都是个损失。这些人的问题，往往被人认为是些小事情；又往往被人不注意去解决。应该知道，领导干部的小事情，也是大事情，领导干部是机关工作人员的头，是机关工作的头，头有了毛病，即使小毛病，也会影响机关工作人员和机关工作健康地发展。过去，有许多机关工作不好，还不是首先因为头有了毛病。现在，有许多机关工作中出现了又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面和大闹技术革命和文化革命大跃进形势，也是首先因为头的工作作风和工作方法有了改进。
    已经取得整风运动全胜的单位，就要认真总结整风运动经验。这次整风运动的经验是非常丰富的。为了说明总结整风运动经验的重要，我们说一两点意见。
    虚实并举，以虚带实，是这次整风运动中的一个很重要的经验。过去有一个相当长时期，许多领导机关领导干部是只务实不务虚，只管业务不管政治的。因为如此，在许多重大问题上就分不清主流和支流，本质和现象，东风和西风，红旗和白旗。结果，就发生了不少政治性的错误。经过这次整风运动，不仅整风运动本身是一次大规模的务虚运动，而且在整风运动中又提倡以虚带实虚实并举，对只务实不务虚只问业务不问政治的倾向作了批判，这就使大家认识了以虚带实，虚实并举的重要，都注意务虚了。这样，政治挂帅了，思想上的红旗插起来了，风来了可以辨别方向了，工作方法对头了。于是过去长期弄不清楚的问题弄清楚了，长期解决不了的问题解决了，而且解决得很好。这样好的经验难道不应当加以总结吗？难道不应当贯彻到今后的工作中去吗？难道还能允许今后的工作中出现那种只务实不务虚只问业务不问政治的倾向吗？当然是不允许的。
    这次整风运动，大鸣大放大争大辩和大字报的群众运动的工作方法，给予我们的教育是很深刻的采用这个方法以后，许多难以揭发出来的问题揭发出来了，许多难以解决的问题解决了，许多难以解决得好的问题解决得好了。更重要的，把这一工作方法用到日常工作中去，就出现了新的局面。上半年，我们结合全民整风，对群众进行了社会主义总路线的教育，又采用了这种适合当前群众要求的群众运动方法，立即掀起了一个万马奔腾，势如破竹的大跃进的形势。半年之内，我们就新建起了三十多万个地方工业单位，我们的夏粮和早稻的产量比去年增加了八百四十亿斤，全国已有一千二百四十个县普及了小学教育，四百四十四个县基本上扫除了文盲。这是过去几十年几百年，甚至几千年所没有做到的事情。这个经验难道不应当总结吗？难道不应当贯彻到下一个运动中去吗？
    总结经验的方法是可以各种各样的。但有一点是共同的，那就是要采取群众运动的方法。国务院秘书厅发动的“一百篇文章运动”，就是采用群众运动方法总结整风经验方法之一，他们发动大家来写整风经验，有的写大鸣大放大争大辩的经验，有的写红专辩论的经验，有的写交心运动的经验，有的写大字报的经验，有的写反右派斗争的经验……。有的是根据一人一事的体会，加以总结，有的是几个人合作总结一个单位的集体经验。这样就会把大多数人吸收到总结经验的运动中来。既可以使群众加深对于整风经验的认识，又可以使领导上的全面总结获得更为广泛的群众基础，而且这也是多快好省地来总结经验。
    结束工作，是整风运动的最后的一件大事，在整风运动开始时，我们曾要求大家大胆地放、坚决地放、彻底地放和大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改。现在我们要向大家提出一个新的要求：大家要把整风运动结束好，为下一个运动作好准备工作！
