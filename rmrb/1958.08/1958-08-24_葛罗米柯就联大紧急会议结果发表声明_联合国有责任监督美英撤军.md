Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 23rd: TASS, New York, August 23rd: Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session and Soviet Foreign Minister, held a press conference for Soviet and foreign journalists on the 22nd regarding the results of the session. Below is a detailed summary of his statement.

The Soviet delegation is satisfied with the results of this United Nations General Assembly because the resolution adopted by the meeting on the issue under discussion took an important step in easing the tense situation in the Near and Middle East caused by the aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan.

The resolution of the General Assembly reflects the will of the people of all countries, past and present, demanding the most rapid withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan, because the resolution directly addresses the need for the rapid withdrawal of US and British troops from these two countries. Any reservations or prevarications will not help to escape this fact, and any attempt to add other meanings to the content of the resolution is without any basis.

The General Assembly adopted the proposal of the ten Arab countries, which is to firmly condemn foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries. In the resolution it adopted, the General Assembly called on all member states of the United Nations to strictly adhere to the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, and strict non-interference in internal affairs in international relations. Who can deny that this call is a categorical warning to those who have grossly violated the United Nations Charter and carried out armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan.

It is still possible to find people who like to put things in such a way that the principles of international relations endorsed by the General Assembly can only be applied with reservations to Arab countries, that is, some Arab countries cannot live without foreign bayonets. However, it goes without saying that there cannot be two standards here. Non-interference in internal affairs is a fundamental principle of international relations, and whether it is Arab countries, or the United States, Britain, and all other countries, they must abide by this principle equally.

The General Assembly once again endorsed the principle that some countries should not interfere in the affairs of other countries, thereby opposing all kinds of "isms" that have been used to justify expansion and aggression against Near and Middle Eastern countries. Although some delegations did not directly talk about this for well-known reasons, such a conclusion is irrefutable.

Of course, it would be wrong to think that the General Assembly has now adopted a good resolution and completed all the tasks of mediating the situation in the Near and Middle East. It is not enough to simply pass good resolutions; it is also necessary to ensure that the resolution can be implemented and implemented quickly. There must be no delays in the implementation of this resolution. It should be said that part of the responsibility in this regard rests with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and we hope that he will urge the rapid withdrawal of foreign troops. If anyone wants to hide behind the Secretary-General in an attempt to delay the withdrawal of troops, it would be ignoring the will of the General Assembly. We believe that the United Nations should be on guard in this regard.

The resolution adopted by the General Assembly also proves that the vast majority of its participants ignored the attempts of the United States and Britain, who originally wanted to win people's support for their armed actions, or at least support their policy of continuing to occupy Lebanon and Jordan. The letters from the US Secretary of State and the British Foreign Secretary to the President of the General Assembly (which the General Assembly ignored) and the proposals put forward in the name of Norway and certain other countries, but which actually reflected the views of the United States and Britain, are manifestations of this attempt.

It should be pointed out that the General Assembly did not allow those with ulterior motives to use the following means to divert the General Assembly away from the discussion of the main issue...the withdrawal of troops. These means are: extravagant talk about plans for the "economic development" of Arab countries, schemes to establish United Nations armed forces, and proposals similar to these that are unrelated to the task of eliminating the tension and current crisis in the Near and Middle East caused by US-British actions.

Another important aspect of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly must be mentioned. This resolution shows that the Arab countries have taken a good step forward in their unity.

We hope that this experience will help the Arab countries to unite on the basis of protecting and strengthening their independence and sovereignty. This is what the Soviet Union hopes for the Arab people, and only this. The Soviet Union is deeply concerned that the Near and Middle East region becomes a region of lasting peace, not a place for imperialist conspiracies and military provocations, where more and more fuel has been accumulated for many years, and therefore the danger of an explosion that could seriously harm the cause of peace is also increasing.

Of course, it would be too optimistic to conclude that from today on, the following dangers will be eliminated: the danger that someone will try to continue to pursue a policy of instigation, artificially create contradictions between Arab countries, and re-attempt to provoke conflicts in these countries. But it can be said with great certainty that it is becoming more and more difficult to implement such a policy towards Arab countries day by day.

Many people may ask why the Soviet Union takes such a firm stand on the issue of the withdrawal of US-British troops from the Middle East and why the Soviet Union insists on immediate withdrawal? We feel that it is not difficult to answer this question. The Near and Middle Eastern countries are our neighbors, so the Soviet Union and all the Soviet people cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening in this region. The presence of foreign troops on the territory of the Near and Middle Eastern countries, the establishment of foreign military bases there, and the creation of various conspiracies that threaten the peace of this region are a direct threat to the security of the Soviet Union. We believe that only the blind and those who deliberately close their eyes to the actual situation cannot see this.

The Soviet Union also believes that the tension in this region, especially the disruption of peace, is a threat to world peace.

This is why the Soviet Union takes such a firm stand on this issue and why the Soviet Union has repeatedly asked the United States, Britain, and many other countries to pay attention to the dangerousness of the situation in the Near and Middle East.

The Soviet Union has repeatedly tried to reach an agreement with Western countries to stop foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries, so that the people of these countries can solve their own internal affairs without any foreign interference. These attempts have not been successful until now, and we regret this. We hope that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly, which talks about not allowing some countries to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, can force Western countries, especially the United States, to more calmly assess the situation in the Near and Middle East and abandon their policy of grossly interfering in the internal affairs of the countries in this region.

### 葛罗米柯就联大紧急会议结果发表声明  联合国有责任监督美英撤军

　　葛罗米柯就联大紧急会议结果发表声明
    联合国有责任监督美英撤军
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约23日讯：苏联出席联合国大会紧急特别会议代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯22日在为苏联和外国记者举行的记者招待会上就这次会议的结果发表了一篇声明，下面是声明的详细摘要。
    苏联代表团对这次联合国大会的结果感到满意，因为这次会议就所讨论的问题通过的决议，在缓和由于美英两国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦而引起的中近东的紧张局势方面走了重要的一步。
    大会的决议反映了过去和现在都要求外国军队最迅速地撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的各国人民的意志，因为在决议中直接谈到了美英军队必须迅速撤离这两个国家。任何保留和推托都无助于逃避这个事实，任何想把另外的意义加到决议内容中的企图都是没有任何基础的。
    大会通过了十个阿拉伯国家的建议，也就是坚决谴责外国干涉中近东国家的内政。大会在通过的决议中号召联合国全体会员国在国际关系上严格遵循相互尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，严格地互不干涉内政的原则。谁能否认，这一号召对那些粗暴地破坏联合国宪章而对黎巴嫩和约旦进行武装干涉的人是一个斩钉截铁的警告。
    还可以找到这样的人，他们喜欢把事情说成这样：大会所赞同的、国际间相互关系的原则只能有保留地适用于阿拉伯国家，那就是某些阿拉伯国家没有外国的刺刀就不能过日子。但是，不言而喻，这里不可能有两种标准。不干涉内政，这是国际关系的一个基本原则，无论是阿拉伯国家，或者是美国、英国和所有其他国家都要同样地遵守这个原则。
    大会再一次赞同了一些国家不得干涉另一些国家事务的原则，从而反对了形形色色的被人拿来为向中近东国家扩张和侵略辩护的“主义”。尽管某些代表团由于尽人皆知的原因没有直接地谈到这一点，但是这样的结论是无可辩驳的。
    当然，如果认为现在大会通过了很好的决议，完成了调解中近东局势的全部事情，那是错误的。仅仅通过了良好的决议还不够，还必须保证这个决议能够实现并且迅速地实现。必须不准许对执行这个决议有任何拖延。应当说，在这方面的责任有一部分是落在联合国秘书长的身上，我们希望他将敦促外国军队迅速撤退。如果有谁想要躲在秘书长的背后企图拖延撤军，那就是无视大会的意志。我们认为，联合国应当在这方面加以提防。
    大会通过的决议还证明，它的绝大多数参加者没有理睬美国和英国的企图，美英两国原先想争取人们支持他们的武装行动，或者至少支持他们继续占领黎巴嫩和约旦的方针。大家所知道的美国国务卿和英国外交大臣给大会主席的信（大会没有理睬这些信）以及以挪威和某些其他国家名义提出的，实际上却反映美国和英国观点的提案，就是这种企图的表现。
    应当指出这样一个好的情况：大会没有允许别有用心的人企图用下列手段使大会离开对主要问题……撤军问题的讨论。这些手段就是：侈谈关于阿拉伯国家“经济发展”的计划，建立联合国武装部队的方案和与此类似的同消除美英行动引起的中近东地区的紧张局势和当前危急状况这个任务无关的提案。
    必须谈到大会所通过的决议的另一个重要方面。这个决议表明，阿拉伯国家在它们的团结方面迈进了不坏的一步。
    我们希望，这个经验将有助于阿拉伯国家在保护和加强它们的独立和主权的基础上团结起来。苏联希望于阿拉伯人民的正是这一点，也仅仅是这一点。苏联所深切关心的是希望中近东地区成为持久和平的地区，而不是帝国主义进行阴谋和军事挑衅的地方，在这里，不少年以来已经积累了越来越多的燃料，因此可能引起对于和平事业有严重危害的爆炸的危险也在加剧。
    当然，如果得出结论说，从今天起，下列危险就会消除，那未免过分乐观了，这种危险就是：有人企图继续执行挑拨离间的政策、人为地制造阿拉伯各国之间的矛盾，重新企图挑拨这些国家发生冲突。但是可以十分有把握地说，对阿拉伯国家实行这种政策是一天比一天困难了。
    很多人可能要问，为什么苏联在关于美英军队撤出中近东的问题上采取如此坚决的立场和为什么苏联坚持必须立即撤军？我们觉得，回答这个问题是不困难的。中近东国家是我们的邻国，因此苏联以及全体苏联人民对于这个地区所发生的事情根本不能置若罔闻。有外国军队留在中近东国家的领土上，在那里建立外国的军事基地和制造各种有破坏这个地区和平的危险的阴谋，这是对于苏联安全的直接威胁。我们相信，只有瞎子和那些故意闭着眼睛不看实际情况的人才看不到这一点。
    苏联还认为，这个地区的紧张局势，特别是对于和平的破坏，是对于世界和平的威胁。
    这就是为什么苏联在这个问题上采取如此坚决的立场，为什么苏联不止一次地要求美国、英国和很多其他国家注意中近东局势的危险性的原因。
    苏联不止一次地试图同西方国家达成协议以便停止外国对于中近东国家内政的干涉，使这些国家的人民有可能不受任何外来干涉自己解决自己的内政。这些尝试直到现在还没有获得成功，我们对此表示遗憾。我们希望，大会通过的谈到不容许一些国家干涉另一些国家内政的决议，能够迫使西方国家、首先是美国更冷静地估计中近东的局势，并且放弃它们所实行的粗暴干涉这个地区国家内政的政策。
