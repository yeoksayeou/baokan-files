　　Combining Philosophical Research with Leap Forward Planning
    Seeking the Establishment of a Philosophy Academy at the New Shipbuilding Plant
    (Our Report) The Shanghai Qiu Xin Shipyard, the birthplace of Shanghai's first workers' philosophy group, recently established a "Philosophy Research Academy." More than 600 people, including the Party Committee Secretary, the Factory Director, workers, engineering technicians, and office cadres, have signed up to participate in the study.
    The Qiu Xin Shipyard Philosophy Research Academy is a garden for the factory's employees to learn theory, apply theory, speak about theory, and develop theory. The academy's course content is closely integrated with the actual problems existing within the factory. The first lesson, "Principal Contradiction," is explained in conjunction with the factory's current Leap Forward goal: to shorten the construction cycle of a 250-horsepower fishing vessel from 351 days to 82 days. This method of learning, which is closely integrated with production practice and serves production, is a model for theoretical study.
    Lecturing in this academy are the factory's Party Committee Secretary, Factory Director, Chairman of the Trade Union, and workers, who are also students in the academy. This teaching method, where everyone is both a student and a teacher, fully embodies the mass line in theoretical work.

　　把哲学研究同跃进规划结合起来
    求新造船厂成立哲学学院
    本报讯　上海第一个工人哲学小组的诞生地——上海求新造船厂最近成立了一个“哲学研究学院”。党委书记、厂长、工人、工程技术人员、科室干部等六百多人报名参加学习。
    求新造船厂哲学研究学院是该厂职工学理论、用理论、讲理论、发展理论的园地。学院的课程内容紧紧地和厂内存在的实际问题相结合。第一课“主要矛盾”的内容就是结合该厂目前的跃进目标：把二百五十马力渔轮的建造周期从三百五十一天缩短到八十二天来讲解的。这种密切结合生产实际，为生产服务的学习方法是理论学习的范例。
    在这个学院里讲课的有该厂的党委书记、厂长、工会主席和工人，他们同时又都是学院里的学员。这种既是学生又是先生的教学方法，充分体现了理论工作的群众路线。
