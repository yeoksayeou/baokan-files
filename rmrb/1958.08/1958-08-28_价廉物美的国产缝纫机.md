　　Inexpensive and Good Quality Domestically Produced Sewing Machines
　　Editor's Note: Currently, many urban and rural women are organizing sewing production groups. They have written to us requesting that we introduce several high-quality, low-priced sewing machines for them to use as a reference when purchasing.
　　We have specially asked Comrade Xuan Qizhong, who sells sewing machines at the Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing, to introduce the characteristics and prices of several commonly sold domestically produced sewing machines, as follows, for your reference.
　　1. Standard Brand 15-201 Model Sewing Machine, produced by the Shanghai Public-Private Joint Hui Gong Sewing Machine Factory: This sewing machine is easy to use, the machine runs quietly, and it is suitable for both sewing and embroidery. Because the "feed dog" on the machine can automatically rise and fall, the fabric can automatically move back and forth. The current selling price in Beijing is 168.30 yuan per unit.
　　2. Invincible Brand 15-102 Model Sewing Machine, produced by the Shanghai Public-Private Joint Xie Chang Sewing Machine Factory: The style is beautiful and generous, and it is convenient to use, but the machine runs a bit louder. Each unit sells for 187 yuan.
　　3. 15-80, 15-566, and 15-101 Model Sewing Machines, produced in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Sichuan, and other places: These three types of sewing machines are all suitable for home sewing and embroidery. However, the assembly is not ideal enough, the sound is louder, and the "feed dog" on the machine cannot automatically rise and fall, so the fabric can only move forward and still needs improvement. The selling price of the 15-80 model is 146.60 yuan per unit, the 15-566 model is 173 yuan, and the 15-101 model is 153 yuan.
　　4. 15-35 Model Sewing Machine, produced by the Shanghai Honeybee Sewing Machine Factory, and the 44-13 Model Sewing Machine, produced in Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places, also have the advantages of the above five sewing machines. These two machines are larger in size and are suitable for larger sewing factories to use. The selling price per unit is 125.90 yuan for the 15-35 model and 188 yuan for the 44-3 model.

　　价廉物美的国产缝纫机
    编者按　现在，很多城市和农村妇女组织缝纫生产组，她们来信要求我们介绍几种物美价廉的缝纫机，作为选购时的参考。
    我们特请北京市王府井百货大楼经售缝纫机的宣启忠同志把几种经常出售的国产缝纫机的特点和价格介绍如下，供大家参考。
    一、上海公私合营惠工缝纫机厂出的标准牌一五——二○一型缝纫机：这种缝纫机使用轻便，机器走动声不大，缝纫和刺绣都适用。因为机器上的“马牙”能自动起落，衣物可以自动来回走动。现在北京每台卖价一百六十八元三角。
    二、上海公私合营协昌缝纫机厂出产的无敌牌一五——一○二型缝纫机：样式美观大方，使用便利，就是机器走动声稍大。每台卖价一百八十七元。
    三、上海、天津、广州、四川等地出产的一五——八○型、一五——五六六型、一五——一○一型缝纫机：这三种缝纫机都适合家庭缝纫和刺绣使用。但装配还不够理想，声音较大，机器上的“马牙”不能自动起落，故衣物只能向前走动，还需改进。一五——八○型每台的卖价是一百四十六元六角，一五——五六六型的为一百七十三元，一五——一○一型的为一百五十三元。
    四、上海蜜蜂缝纫机厂出产的一五——三五型缝纫机和广州、天津等地出品的四四——一三型缝纫机，也都具备上述五种缝纫机的优点。这两种机器体积较大，适合较大的缝纫工厂使用。每台售价，一五——三五型为一百二十五元九角，四四——三型为一百八十八元。
