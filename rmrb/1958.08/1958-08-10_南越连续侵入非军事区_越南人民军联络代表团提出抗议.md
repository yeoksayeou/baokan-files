Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 9th: The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently wrote five letters to the International Commission, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' continuous dispatch of personnel to intrude into the Demilitarized Zone.

The letters list facts pointing out that, from June 11th to July 13th, in the thirteen incidents already discovered of South Vietnamese people illegally intruding into the Demilitarized Zone, a total of more than four hundred administrative and other unarmed personnel, seventy armed police, and a large detachment of security guards illegally entered the southern section of the Demilitarized Zone.

The letters point out that the South Vietnamese armed police and security guards who intruded into the Demilitarized Zone monitored and intimidated former resistance members and the families of those who had gathered in the North day and night in the areas where they operated, causing constant anxiety among the local people and seriously affecting their normal lives.

South Vietnamese administrative personnel and others who intruded into the Demilitarized Zone blatantly went to the Hien Luong Bridge area and the north bank to spy and take photographs. Two groups of these personnel were caught in the act by the International Commission's 76th Group; one group of seventeen people hurriedly fled when they encountered the 76th Group.

The Liaison Delegation pointed out in the letters that the aforementioned actions of the South Vietnamese authorities seriously violated the Geneva Accords and the regulations of the Demilitarized Zone, and demanded that the International Commission find ways to prevent similar incidents from continuing to occur.

    南越连续侵入非军事区
    越南人民军联络代表团提出抗议
    新华社河内9日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团最近写了五封信给国际委员会，抗议南越当局不断派遣人员侵入非军事区。
    信中列举事实指出，从6月11日到7月13日期间，已经发现的十三起南越人民非法侵入非军事区的事件中，共有四百多名行政和其他非武装人员、七十名武装警察和保安团一个大队非法进入了非军事区南段。
    信中指出，侵入非军事区的南越武装警察和保安团在他们活动的地区日夜对前抗战人员和集结到北方的人员的家属进行监视和恫吓，使得当地人民终日惶惶不安，严重影响了人民的正常生活。
    侵入非军事区的南越行政人员等则明目张胆地到贤良桥一带和北岸窥探和摄影；其中有两批人员刚好被国际委员会第七十六小组碰见，包括十七个人的一批在碰见第七十六小组时赶忙逃跑。
    联络代表团在信中指出南越当局人员的上述行动严重违反了日内瓦协议和非军事区的规章，并且要求国际委员会设法制止继续发生同类事件。
