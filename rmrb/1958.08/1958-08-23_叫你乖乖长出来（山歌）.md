Mischievous cornfields, empty stalks and missing ears are infuriating;
Let me stick a bamboo skewer in you, and make you grow up obediently.

The General Line is a bright light, the wisdom of the masses surpasses Confucius;
Inserting skewers into corn is a good method, eliminating empty stalks and increasing production.

To eliminate empty stalks, we must be diligent, giving each one several injections;
Turning one into several, increasing production by more than 400,000 jin.

Inserting skewers into corn is truly powerful, guaranteeing a bumper harvest this year;
Even if each stalk grows just one more ear, the accumulated weight will break the roof beam.

Songs fill the mountains and fields, men and women, old and young, whittle bamboo skewers,
Inserting one between two nodes, striving for a yield of 3,000 jin per mu.

　　叫你乖乖长出来（山歌）
　　调皮捣蛋包谷林，空秆缺包呕死人；
　　给你插根竹签子，叫你乖乖长出来。
　　总路线，是明灯，群众智慧赛孔明；
　　包谷插签办法好，消灭空秆把产增。
　　消灭空秆要用心，每根给他打几针；
　　一个改变成几个，增产四十多万斤。
    包谷插签真正强，保证今年多打粮；
    每根就算增一个，毫毛成捆压断梁。
    满山遍野是歌声，男女老少削竹签，
    两个节间插一个，争取亩产三千斤。
