Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd dispatch from Amman: After the United States and Britain were forced to recognize the Republic of Iraq, King Hussein of Jordan issued a "proclamation" on the 2nd, acknowledging that the Iraq-Jordan Federation no longer existed, and announced that the constitution would be amended accordingly.

This federation had already ceased to exist since the Republic of Iraq announced its withdrawal the day after its establishment. However, under the instigation of American and British imperialists, Hussein even styled himself as the "head" of this federation, and clamored to go to Iraq in this capacity to "maintain law and order." The United States, Britain, and the remaining members of the "Baghdad Pact" also plotted to use this non-existent federation as an excuse to launch armed intervention against Iraq. However, the Republic of Iraq received strong support from socialist countries and the people of the world, and the United States and Britain finally had to change their strategy and were forced to recognize the Republic of Iraq. This forced Hussein, who relied on the support of the British occupation forces and American and British subsidies, to admit that the Iraq-Jordan Federation had long ceased to exist.

According to United Press International, the fact that the United States and Britain were forced to recognize the Republic of Iraq had plunged Hussein's small dynasty into a state of "extreme pessimism."

While having to discard the Iraq-Jordan Federation relic, Hussein even tried to seize the opportunity to make one last grab for money. In his "proclamation," he said that his government would "trusteeship" the funds and property of the Iraq-Jordan Federation in Jordan.

British occupation forces conducted military exercises on August 2nd to embolden Hussein and intimidate the Jordanian people. Other reports said that Britain had also specially dispatched four personnel from the London Metropolitan Police to Amman to be responsible for Hussein's "security."

    侯赛因自知山穷水尽
    被迫扔掉伊约联邦破灵牌
    新华社3日讯　安曼消息：在美国和英国被迫承认伊拉克共和国以后，约旦国王侯赛因在2日发布“谕旨”承认，伊拉克—约旦联邦已经不再存在，并且宣布为此而修改宪法。
    这个联邦由于伊拉克共和国在成立后第二天就宣布退出，因而早已不存在。但是在美英帝国主义者指使下，侯赛因还自封为这个联邦的“元首”，而且叫嚷要以这个身份去伊拉克“维持法律和秩序”。美英和“巴格达条约”残余成员国也策划利用这个不存在的联邦作为对伊拉克发动武装干涉的借口。可是伊拉克共和国受到社会主义国家和全世界人民的有力支持，美国和英国也终于只好改变策略，被迫承认伊拉克共和国。这就迫使倚靠英国占领军的支撑和美英津贴金过日子的侯赛因不得不跟着承认伊拉克—约旦联邦早已不存在的事实。
    据合众国际社透露，美英被迫承认伊拉克共和国这个事实已经使侯赛因小王朝陷入“极为悲观的状态”。
    侯赛因在不得不扔掉伊拉克—约旦联邦这块灵牌的同时，居然还想乘机最后捞一把钱。他在“谕旨”中说，他的政府将“托管”伊拉克—约旦联邦在约旦的款项和财产。
    英国占领军为了替侯赛因壮胆和恫吓约旦人民，在8月2日举行了军事演习。另有消息说，英国还特别派了四名伦敦警察厅人员到安曼，来负责侯赛因的“安全”。
