　　The First Meal at the Rural Mess Hall
　　Jin Shi
　　On the evening of July 26th, in Houjie, Xilaobian, Yingkou, the crackling sound of "Erzijiao" firecrackers filled the air. Agricultural cooperative members, their faces beaming with smiles, headed in the direction of the explosions. The children dashed forward in a swarm, as if rushing to a grand spectacle.
　　"Auntie, what's the big celebration for this time that warrants setting off firecrackers?"
　　"Don't you know? This is the first meal at the farmer's collective mess hall for our First Production Team." The old woman practically answered me with laughter.
　　Oh! I recalled that last night, the First Team didn't return from irrigating the fields until after 11 o'clock, and the production team's female leader, Wei Furong, still took the lead in a crash effort to renovate the mess hall. They're having a collective dinner tonight. What a leap forward!
　　For farmers from each household to come together to eat is no simple feat. From individual dispersal to centralized cooperation, the socialist happy life feels more real in people's hearts. Excitedly, I followed the crowd heading to the mess hall for dinner.
　　Hanging on the willow tree in front of Yan Qingxi's house was a wooden plaque, on which was neatly written: "Huayingtai Township, Laobian Work Area, First Team Mess Hall."
　　It turned out that Yan Qingxi had given up his house to be used as the collective mess hall.
　　Don't let Yan Qingxi's age of forty-plus fool you, he works decisively, surpassing even young people. When the branch studied the implementation of "two-izations" (collectivized eating and nurseries), because the Second Team's houses were spacious and the conditions were better than the other teams, the plan was to use the Second Team as a pilot. Although Yan Qingxi didn't speak at the meeting, he felt uneasy: Our First Team is always at the forefront in everything, we can't fall behind in setting up a mess hall!
　　After the meeting, he went to Production Team Leader Ma Zhaoji, Wei Furong, Yan Zhongmin, and Zhang Deyu to discuss giving up his house to be used as a mess hall. Communist Youth League member Yan Zhongmin quickly chimed in: "I'll also give up my three east wing rooms! Your four north rooms can be the dining hall, and my three east rooms can be the kitchen, and the mess hall is solved."
　　They did as they said, tearing down walls and dismantling the kang overnight in a crash effort.
　　Speaking of setting up a mess hall, there wasn't a complete lack of resistance. Some people raised concerns such as, is participation in the collective mess hall compulsory? Can you choose the dishes you want to eat? What if sick or elderly people can't go to the mess hall? After the branch studied these issues, they thoroughly explained them to the masses in light of the commune's situation, and the issues were resolved. The Laobian area hadn't seen rain for three months, and over 12,000 mu of dry land needed to be irrigated day and night, demanding intensive labor. There was no room for people to have idle time. Collective dining ensured the attendance rate of women and didn't delay work time. This was the greatest advantage on display.
　　Those who supported the collective mess hall were mainly the women. Old Mrs. Zhang, in her sixties, said, "Ah, we've finally come to the end of it! No more being stuck 'revolving around the stove.' We women have been exhausted from cooking and making meals all our lives, and it doesn't seem like we've accomplished anything!"
　　Old Mrs. Zhang spoke the words that had been repressed in the hearts of women for thousands of years. Truly, only under the socialist system can women truly come to the end of their suffering! Women's labor power can finally be completely liberated. The forty-three households of the First Team in the Laobian Work Area used to need at least forty-three people to cook and make meals. Now that a collective mess hall has been established, only five people are needed. Women's leader Wei Furong encouraged the women to match the men in full attendance and labor, and to strive for genuine independence in economic status.
　　Nearby factories, hearing that the Laobian Work Area was setting up a collective mess hall, supported them with sand, cement, bricks, paper, etc. The First Team's collective mess hall only spent 2 yuan and 2 fen to buy two dishcloths, an iron spoon, and a stove bottom to get started.
　　Vegetable gardens would rather sell for less money and supply fresh vegetables.
　　The spacious courtyard. The four connected north rooms had their windows wide open, and neat tables were arranged inside. Several young pioneers were loudly reciting slogans written on red and green paper and posted on the wall:
　　"The collective mess hall is truly good,
　　Household chores are fewer.
　　The collective mess hall has many benefits,
　　Full attendance, more work."
　　The people coming to eat were chuckling, unaccustomed to it, with a sense of novelty, queuing up. The children were chasing each other in the crowd. The surrounding area was packed with male and female commune members from other production teams who came to visit.
　　Team Leader Wei Furong was weighing the steamed buns, Yan Zhongmin was passing out the dishes, and Zhang Deyu was keeping the accounts, busier than the service personnel in a state-run cafeteria tenfold!
　　"Fellow villagers! Fellow villagers!" Production Team Leader Ma Zhaoji spoke. The courtyard immediately quieted down: "Our team's mess hall is officially established today. Participation in the mess hall is voluntary. Whoever is not at ease can try it out first. If you don't eat well, you can withdraw. If you see it's good, we welcome you to join at any time." He paused, seeming like he hadn't made something clear. Then he continued: "Our mess hall has just been established, everyone should care about it and offer more suggestions for improvement!"
　　Before his voice faded, Shi Wannian, an elderly Party member from the Third Team, sixty-one years old, dragging his ailing body, walked up to Team Leader Ma:
　　"Zhaoji, the steamed buns should be weighed when they're being steamed. If you weigh them now, people will have to wait to eat. Will we make it to the fields on time?"
　　Cadre Qiu Xiangwen, who had been sent to work at the grassroots level, also said to Team Leader Ma, "Old Ma, the table numbers should be numbered, and each household's ration should be calculated well so that everyone can eat as soon as they arrive."
　　On the first day of collective meals, only two of the forty-three households didn't participate because they had elderly and sick people at home. At the start of the meal, youth team member Cao Lianqi composed a doggerel to praise the collective mess hall:
　　"The collective mess hall has many benefits,
　　Saving money, saving rice, many dishes,
　　Eating well, able to work,
　　Increased production and income are guaranteed.
　　The collective mess hall has great benefits,
　　Going to work and leaving work together,
　　Convenient for meetings, not late,
　　And time to study culture!
　　To make the mess hall even better,
　　Hope everyone cares about it!"

　　农村食堂第一餐
　　金矢
    7月26日傍晚，营口西老边后街，噼噼啪啪响着“二起交”的爆炸声。农业社员们笑容满面地向放炮的方向走去。孩子们一窝蜂地向前跑，像是赶什么热闹。
      “大娘，又是为着什么大喜事放炮呀？”
      “你不知道吗？这是我们第一生产队的农民集体食堂，吃头一顿饭啦。”老大娘几乎是用笑声来回答我。
    哦！我想起昨天夜里，第一队浇水回来已经十一点多了，生产队女队长魏福蓉还带头去突击整修食堂。今天就集体开晚饭了，真是跃进！
    一家一户的农民能够凑在一起吃饭，这可不简单。从个体分散到集中合作，社会主义的幸福生活在人们心里更真切了。我激动地随着吃饭的人群走向食堂。
    在阎庆喜门前的柳树上挂着一块木牌，上面工正地写着“花英台乡老边作业区第一队食堂”。
    原来阎庆喜把房子让出来，做集体食堂了。
    别看阎庆喜是四十多岁的人，办事干脆利落，年青人也比不上他。当支部研究实现“两化”（吃饭集体化，托儿化）时，因为二队房子宽敞，条件较其他队为好，计划在二队做试点。在会上阎庆喜虽没作声，心里却很不平静：我们一队事事都走在前头，办食堂也不能落后哇！
    会后，他去找生产队长马兆江、魏福蓉和阎仲民、张德余研究。要把自己的房子让出来做食堂。共青团员阎仲民一听也急忙表示：“我那三间东厢房也让出来！你那四间北房做饭厅，我这三间东房做厨房，食堂就算解决了。”
    他们说干就干，拆墙、扒炕，连夜就突击起来。
    说起办食堂，并不是没有阻力的。有些群众提出，集体食堂是不是强迫参加？吃菜能随便吗？有病人、老年人不能去食堂吃怎办？等等。这些问题经支部研究后，结合社里的情况细致地向群众一解释，便搞通了。老边地区三个月没下雨了，一万二千多亩的旱田需要日夜不停地汲水灌溉，紧张的劳动，急需更多的劳动力，更不容许人们有闲散的时间。集体吃饭，能保证妇女出勤率，也不耽误上工的时间。这是摆在面前最大的优越性。
    拥护集体食堂的，要算妇女们最坚决了。六十多岁的张老大娘说：“咳，可熬出头来啦！再不当
  ‘锅台转’了。妇道人家，成年烧火做饭，累得要死，也看不出做了些啥！”
    张大娘说出了积压在妇女心里的几千年的话语。真的，只有社会主义制度下，妇女才真正熬出了头！妇女的劳动力才彻底得到解放。老边作业区第一队的四十三户人家，过去最少要有四十三个人烧火做饭，现在成立了集体食堂，只需五个人就够了。妇女队长魏福蓉鼓励妇女们，要和男人们比出全勤，比劳动，要在经济地位上争取真正的独立。
    附近的工厂，听说老边作业区要办集体食堂，支援了沙子、洋灰、砖、纸张等。第一队的集体食堂，只花了二元零二分钱，买了两条拈巾，一个铁勺，一个炉底，就办起来了。
    菜圃宁愿少卖钱，也将新鲜的蔬菜供应来。
    宽敞的大院子。四间打通了的北房大敞着窗子，里边整齐地摆着桌子。几个红领巾在高声朗读那用红绿纸写的张贴在墙上的标语：
      “集体食堂真正好，
    家务事牵连少。
    集体食堂好处多，
    出全勤，多干活。”
    来用餐的人们，嘻笑着，不习惯地怀着新奇的心情排着队。小孩子们在人群里相互追逐着。周围挤满了来参观的其他生产队的男女社员们。
    魏福蓉队长，称着馒头，阎仲民传递着菜盘子，张德余记着账，真比国营食堂里的服务员要忙十倍！
      “老乡们！老乡们！”马兆江生产队长说话了。院里顿时静下来：“咱们一队的食堂，今天正式成立了。参加吃食堂是自愿的，谁不放心，可以先吃着看，如果吃不好，可以退出；看着好，我们随时欢迎你们参加。”他停了停，似乎还有什么没说清。随后又说：“咱们的食堂刚开办，人人要关心，多多提出改进的意见！”
    话音没落，三队的六十一岁的党员石万年老大爷，拖着带病的身体，走到马队长跟前：
    “兆江，那馒头蒸的时候就要称好，现在还称，要等着吃饭，下地能赶趟吗？”
    下放干部丘向文同志也对马队长说“老马，桌号要编好，各户的定量都计算好，使每家来到就吃饭。”
    第一天集体开饭，四十三户人家只有两户因为家里有老年多病的人没参加。开饭时，青年队员曹连奇编了顺口溜歌颂集体食堂：
      “集体食堂好处多，
    省钱省米菜样多，
    吃的好，能劳动，
    增产增收有保证。
    集体食堂好处大，
    上工下工齐刷刷，
    开会方便不迟到，
    还有时间学文化！
    要把食堂办的更好，
    希望大家关心它！”
