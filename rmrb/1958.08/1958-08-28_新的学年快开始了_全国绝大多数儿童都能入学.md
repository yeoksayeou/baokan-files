Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: The first new school year since the great leap forward in the national education cause is about to begin. This year, the vast majority of school-age children across the country will be able to attend school. Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi and other fourteen provinces and cities, the Ningxia region and the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province, have basically universalized primary school education. According to incomplete statistics, among more than two thousand counties and cities across the country, 1,517 counties and cities have universalized primary school education, accounting for more than 66% of the total. By the end of June, there were 83.96 million primary school students nationwide, and the national average enrollment rate of school-age children increased from the original 61.7% to over 80%, with areas that have already universalized primary school education reaching over 90%.

In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, the Party led the masses in running schools. In the few months up to the end of June, more than 337,000 new primary schools were established, increasing the number of enrolled children by more than 19.68 million. This figure is 51% more than the total number of primary school students developed nationwide during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. The current number of primary school students nationwide is equivalent to 3.5 times the number in 1946, which had the largest number of primary school students before liberation. (Attached picture)
