　　Slander is Useless, Threats are Futile
    Soviet "Izvestia" Denounces US Provocations Against China
    (Xinhua News Agency, August 27th) "Izvestia" today published an article by Vladimirov entitled "The Inside Story of a Slander." The article refuted the US State Department's malicious slander against China and exposed the US plot to create tension in the Far East.
    The article wrote: Now, world public opinion is demanding that the United States and Britain fulfill the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session regarding the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, but at this time, Washington is trying hard to divert people's attention from the colonialists' interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and has resorted to the imperialists' usual slanderous means, launching a campaign to slander the People's Republic of China, claiming that it "threatens peace in the Far East." The US State Department issued such accusations against the People's Republic of China on August 8th. Subsequently, there was a continuous stream of hysterical remarks from elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities are also taking measures to intensify the war frenzy enveloping Taiwan.
    The article said that American weapons are being shipped to Taiwan in a continuous stream, and military bases are being built in Taiwan at an accelerated pace. On March 29th, Chiang Kai-shek openly stated that "the preparations for counterattacking the mainland of China are almost complete, and the offensive against the communists will come soon." The Chiang Kai-shek clique is constantly organizing armed provocations against the People's Republic of China, hindering trade and shipping in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Some of the rocket launchers and atomic cannons shipped by the United States to South Korea have been handed over to the South Korean army. The South Korean ruling clique has embarked on the road of openly destroying the Korean Armistice Agreement, and they do not conceal that their army is spareing no effort in preparing to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The United States openly violated the Geneva Accords signed in 1954, and by May of this year had shipped 239 batches of new weapons and other military supplies to South Vietnam. The United States has established a huge armed force in South Vietnam and is carrying out large-scale military construction.
    The article said that the United States itself is also conducting war preparations in the Far East, which is a serious threat to peace in the Far East. It is taking various measures to strengthen the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization bloc. The United States is continuing to equip its troops stationed in the Far East with the latest weapons, including nuclear weapons. According to foreign newspapers, the US troops in South Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan are all nuclear-armed. The US Seventh Fleet and the US Pacific Fleet operating along the coast of the People's Republic of China have atomic weapons. There are plans to expand the network of US rocket and missile launch sites in the region.
    Finally, it cannot be ignored that the United States has practically turned the Pacific region into a testing ground for new types of nuclear weapons. These tests have not stopped until today.
    The article continued, all of this convincingly proves that it is the US ruling clique that should bear full responsibility for the current tense situation in the Far East, and that any propaganda campaign they launch cannot cover up these facts, nor can it help the imperialists evade responsibility.
    The article said that the US State Department has launched another campaign to slander the People's Republic of China, attempting to discredit China's peaceful policies, thereby struggling with the issue of "not recognizing" the 600 million great Chinese people. However, the US State Department has achieved the opposite result. The US government's attitude has aroused condemnation from the vast majority of Asian, African, and European countries.

　　诽谤毫无用处  威胁白费心机
    苏联“消息报”斥美国对我国的挑衅
    据新华社27日讯　“消息报”今天发表了弗拉吉米罗夫的一篇题为“一场诽谤的内幕”的文章。文章驳斥了美国国务院对中国的恶意诽谤，并且揭露了美国在远东制造紧张局势的阴谋活动。
    文章写道：现在，世界公众都在要求美英两国履行联合国大会紧急特别会议关于美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议，但是，在这个时候，华盛顿却竭力想转移人们对殖民主义者干涉其他国家内政的注意，竟又使用了帝国主义者惯用的诽谤手段，展开了一个诽谤中华人民共和国的运动，硬说它“威胁远东和平”。美国国务院8月8日就对人民中国发表了这样的非难。随后源源而来的是蒋介石集团分子的一些歇斯底里的言论。同时，蒋介石当局还在采取措施，来加剧笼罩着台湾的战争狂气氛。
    文章说，美国武器源源不绝地运到台湾，并且正在台湾加紧建设的军事基地。3月29日蒋介石就公开地说，“反攻中国大陆的准备工作差不多完成，向共产党的进攻很快就会来到。”蒋介石集团不断地组织对中华人民共和国的武装挑衅，阻挠在中国东海和南海的贸易航运。美国运入南朝鲜的一部分火箭装置和原子大炮已经交给南朝鲜军队。南朝鲜统治集团走上了公开破环朝鲜停战协定的道路，他们并不掩饰他们的军队在不遗余力地准备向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻。美国公开破坏1954年签定的日内瓦协议，到今年5月止先后向南越运进了二百三十九批新武器和其他军用物资。美国在南越建立了庞大的武装部队，进行着大规模的军事建筑。
    文章说，美国本身也在远东进行战争准备，这是对远东地区和平的严重威胁。它在采取各种措施，来加强侵略性的东南亚条约组织集团。美国正继续用最新式的武器，包括核武器来装备它驻扎在远东地区的军队。据外国报纸报道，在南朝鲜、冲绳岛和台湾的美国军队都有核武装。在中华人民共和国沿岸活动的美国第七舰队以及美国太平洋舰队都有原子武器。现在正计划扩大这一地区的美国火箭和导弹的发射场网。
    最后，不能忽视，美国已经实际上把太平洋地区变成了试验新式的核武器的试验场。这种试验直到今天还没有停止。
    文章接着说，所有这一切令人信服地证明，正是美国统治集团应对远东地区目前的紧张局势负完全责任，他们所挑起的任何宣传运动都不能掩盖这些事实，都不能帮助帝国主义者逃避责任。
    文章说，美国国务院又掀起诽谤中华人民共和国的运动，妄图中伤中国的和平政策，从而在“不承认”六亿伟大的中国人民这个问题上进行挣扎。但是，美国国务院却得到了相反的结果。美国政府这种态度引起了绝大部分亚洲、非洲和欧洲国家的谴责。
