Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st – According to TASS: The delegations of Arab countries, including the United Arab Republic, Lebanon, the Republic of Iraq, and Jordan, which participated in the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation, recently held a meeting in Moscow with representatives of the Soviet Peace Defence Committee and the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee. During the meeting, the two sides discussed the situation in the Middle East and adopted a joint statement. The statement supports the documents of the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference and calls on all peace-loving people of the world to rise up to support the Arab people, take all measures to ensure the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and strive for the convening of a high-level conference.

The joint statement said that the invasion of Lebanon by US troops and the invasion of Jordan by British troops are serious acts of aggression against the sovereignty and independence of these countries, and a prelude to preparing to expand this aggression to the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. The spearhead of this aggression is not only directed at the people of the Arab countries, but also threatens peace throughout the world. Therefore, the struggle of the Arab countries' people to counter aggression in defence of national independence and sovereignty is also a struggle to safeguard world peace and the security of all countries.

The statement said that the Soviet government and the Soviet people stand on the side of the just struggle of the Arab people. This position arises from the basic principles of Soviet foreign policy, which aims to safeguard world peace, ensure the national independence and sovereignty of all countries, not interfere in their internal affairs, and develop comprehensive cooperation with all countries with different political systems.

The joint statement said that world opinion unanimously supports Khrushchev's proposal for an immediate summit conference of great powers. However, the US and British governments are trying to undermine the realization of this proposal, attempting to use various tricks to deceive world opinion, and they are also hurriedly mobilizing armed forces and concentrating them in Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries in the Middle East. The statement calls on the people of all countries to take measures to withdraw the invading troops from the Arab countries and strive for the convening of a high-level conference.

On July 31, the Soviet Peace Defence Committee and the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee jointly sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, requesting the United Nations to take measures to stop the US and British aggression against the Arab countries.

    苏联和阿拉伯国家和平组织代表联合声明
    号召各国人民支援阿拉伯人民
    并用行动争取召开最高级会议
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：参加斯德哥尔摩裁军和国际合作大会的阿拉伯联合共和国、黎巴嫩、伊拉克共和国、约旦等阿拉伯国家的代表团，最近在莫斯科同苏联保卫和平委员会和苏联亚非国家团结委员会的代表举行了会见。会见时，双方讨论了中近东的局势并且通过了联合声明。声明拥护裁军和国际合作大会的各项文件，并且号召世界一切爱好和平的人民起来支援阿拉伯人民，采取一切措施使美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦和争取召开高级会议。
    联合声明说，美国军队侵入黎巴嫩、英国军队侵入约旦，这是对这些国家的主权和独立的严重侵略，是准备把这种侵略扩大到伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的前奏。这种侵略的矛头不仅是针对着阿拉伯国家的人民，它还威胁着全世界的和平。因此，阿拉伯国家人民为保卫民族独立和主权而进行的反击侵略的斗争，同时也是维护世界和平和各国安全的斗争。
    声明说，苏联政府和苏联人民站在阿拉伯人民正义斗争的一边。这种立场是产生于苏联外交政策的基本原则，苏联的外交政策旨在维护世界和平、保障各国人民的民族独立和主权、不干涉它们的内政、同政治制度不同的各国发展全面合作。
    联合声明说，世界舆论一致支持赫鲁晓夫关于立即召开大国首脑会议的建议。但是美英两国政府竭力破坏这个建议的实现，力图玩弄种种手法迷惑世界舆论，而且，它们还匆匆忙忙地动员武装力量，向黎巴嫩、约旦和中近东其他国家集结武装力量。声明号召各国人民采取措施使侵略军队撤出阿拉伯国家并且争取召开高级会议。
    7月31日，苏联保卫和平委员会和苏联亚非国家团结委员会还联名打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求联合国采取措施，制止美英对阿拉伯国家的侵略。
