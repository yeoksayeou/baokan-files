Romanian Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Ludenko

　　Today, I am very happy to extend my warmest respects to the great fraternal Chinese people on the great national holiday of Romania. The Romanian and Chinese peoples are closely linked together for the common great goal of building socialism and defending peace.

　　Today, the Romanian people will celebrate the fourteenth anniversary of Romania's liberation from the shackles of fascism. On August 23, 1944, under the favorable conditions created by the victorious offensive of the Soviet army, the patriotic forces of the people, together with patriotic soldiers, officers and generals, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, completed the armed uprising that overthrew the Antonescu fascist dictatorship.

　　On that night in August, the patriotic fighting forces led and organized by the Romanian Communist Party arrested the leaders and members of the fascist government, and then, together with the Romanian army, after tenacious struggles, drove the Hitlerite troops out of our capital Bucharest, and began to fight in areas such as Ploiesti, Dobruja, Banat, and the Moraysh River basin in order to drive them away and save industrial enterprises from destruction. In just a few days, from August 24 to 31, the Romanian army and patriotic forces captured 40,000 Hitlerite soldiers.

　　After overthrowing the fascist dictatorship, Romania turned its guns on the Hitlerite occupiers. In this way, our country made a significant contribution to accelerating the end of World War II and defeating fascist Germany.

　　Fourteen Romanian divisions, side by side with the Soviet army, penetrated 1,000 kilometers into the Hitlerite army's positions, first in Hungary, and later in Czechoslovakia, thus liberating 4,000 towns and capturing more than 100,000 fascist prisoners.

　　In terms of the forces participating in the war against fascist Germany, Romania ranked fourth, after the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States.

　　The Supreme Command of the Soviet Union repeatedly praised the merits of the various Romanian divisions. Tens of thousands of Romanian soldiers and officers were awarded Soviet and Romanian medals and decorations for their heroic deeds.

　　Romania's participation in the anti-Hitler war is a glorious page in her history.

　　The significance of the armed uprising achieved by the Romanian people under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party fourteen years ago is also embodied in the fact that it marked the beginning of the people's revolution. This revolution guaranteed the establishment of a people's democratic government and the seizure of all political power by the working class and its allied working peasants. This provided the possibility of transitioning to a new stage of the people's revolution, namely the socialist revolution.

　　The fourteen years since our country's liberation is a relatively short historical period. Nevertheless, Romania has made significant achievements in the cause of building socialism. During this period, the Romanian people not only healed the wounds of war, but also raised the national economy to a higher socialist level, making the production and technical levels of industry and agriculture much higher than before the war.

　　In 1957, our country's total industrial output increased to 3.5 times that of 1938, the year with the highest pre-war output. Compared with 1938, the output of machine manufacturing increased more than seven times in 1957, electricity 7.4 times, the chemical industry eight times, the building materials industry nine times, and biogas fifteen times. Before liberation, 95% of the equipment needed by our national economy was imported from abroad, while in 1957 the amount of machinery exports exceeded imports.

　　At the same time, the Romanian people have made significant achievements in the socialist transformation and mechanization of agriculture. At the beginning of 1958, our country had 110,000 agricultural machines and important agricultural equipment, including more than 30,000 tractors. Currently, our country's socialist agricultural sector accounts for 52% of the country's agricultural area. Since last year, our country has had the first batch of many counties and one state that are completely collectivized.

　　Generally speaking, our country's agricultural output has greatly exceeded the output achieved under the bourgeois landlord regime. In 1957, 11 million tons of grain were harvested, while in 1948 only 5,427,800 tons were harvested.

　　Due to the growth of industrial and agricultural output, as well as the growth of commodity turnover, the living standards of the working people are increasing year by year. In 1957, the real wages of the working people exceeded 1950 by 48%.

　　All these achievements made by the Romanian people in building socialism guarantee that Romania will be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial and agricultural country that is constantly developing. All these achievements are the result of the selfless labor of the Romanian people under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, as well as the comprehensive fraternal assistance that the People's Republic of Romania has received from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries.

　　The achievements made by the Romanian people are closely linked to the existence and continuous consolidation of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Romanian people understand that the strengthening of the unity of the socialist camp is the main guarantee for safeguarding the independence of their country and thwarting the imperialist aggressor forces' attempts to undermine the People's Republic of Romania, and also the main guarantee for building socialism victoriously and rapidly in their country. Therefore, the Romanian people refute and oppose any conspiracy by modern revisionism to undermine the unity of the socialist camp.

　　The government of the Romanian People's Republic resolutely pursues a foreign policy of peace and international cooperation: advocating the development of friendly ties with all peace-loving peoples of all countries.

　　The Romanian People's Republic, together with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, firmly supports all initiatives aimed at easing international tensions, guaranteeing the cessation of the arms race, banning atomic bombs, and defending world peace. The government of the Romanian People's Republic and the entire Romanian people condemn the armed aggression of the United States and Great Britain against the peoples of the Middle East and demand that the United States and Great Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

　　More and more people understand that at present, the forces of peace are stronger than the bellicose imperialist forces, and the East wind prevails over the West wind.

　　In the cause of building socialism, a sincere fraternal cooperative relationship based on the principles of proletarian internationalism has been established between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China; cultural, trade, and scientific and technological agreements have been signed between the two countries; these agreements are the basis for developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples.

　　The friendly visit to the People's Republic of China this year by the government delegation led by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, Chivu Stoica, their talks with the leaders of the Chinese state and party, and their direct contact with the Chinese working people, have made further contributions to the deepening of friendship and closer cooperation between the Romanian and Chinese peoples.

　　The Romanian people follow with great interest the achievements made by the great Chinese people in building socialism. We are pleased that the Chinese people are enthusiastically completing the tasks put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China to catch up with and surpass Great Britain in major industrial products. The recent great leap forward achieved by the Chinese people in developing the economy, technology, science, and culture fully proves that these tasks will be completed victoriously.

　　The role of the People's Republic of China in promoting cooperation among the peoples of all countries and defending world peace is growing.

　　The Romanian people are proud of their friendship with the great Chinese people, and are also proud of being members of the invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union together with the great Chinese people, and are confident that our common cause will surely be victorious.

　　庆祝罗马尼亚解放十四周年
　　罗马尼亚驻中华人民共和国大使　鲁登科
    今天，我很高兴能够在罗马尼亚伟大的民族节日，向伟大的兄弟中国人民致以最热烈的敬意。罗马尼亚人民和中国人民为建设社会主义和保卫和平的共同伟大目标而紧密地联结在一起。
    今天，罗马尼亚人民将庆祝罗马尼亚从法西斯桎梏下解放出来的十四周年。1944年8月23日，在苏联军队胜利的攻势所创造的有利条件下，人民爱国力量同爱国的士兵、军官和将军一道，在罗马尼亚共产党领导下，完成了推翻安东尼斯库法西斯专政的武装起义。
    在8月的那一天夜里，罗马尼亚共产党所领导和组织的爱国战斗力量逮捕了法西斯政府的领导者和成员，以后同罗马尼亚军队一起，经过顽强的斗争，把希特勒军队从我国首都布加勒斯特赶出去，并开始在普罗也什蒂、多布鲁查、巴纳特、莫赖什流域等地区进行斗争，以便赶走它们，并使工业企业免遭破坏。仅仅在8月24日到31日几天之间，罗马尼亚军队和爱国力量就俘获了希特勒军队四万名。
    在推翻法西斯专政之后，罗马尼亚把枪口转向希特勒占领者。这样，我国对加速结束第二次世界大战和战胜法西斯德国作出了有意义的贡献。
    罗马尼亚的十四个师同苏联军队并肩深入了希特勒军队阵地一千公里，首先是在匈牙利，以后在捷克斯洛伐克，从而解放了四千座城镇，俘获了十万以上的法西斯俘虏。
    从参加反法西斯德国作战的力量来讲，罗马尼亚仅次于苏联、英国和美国而居第四位。
    苏联最高总司令部屡次表扬了各个罗马尼亚师的功绩。成千成万的罗马尼亚士兵和军官由于英勇的事迹获得了苏联和罗马尼亚的勋章和奖章。
    罗马尼亚的参加反希特勒战争是她历史上光荣的一页。
    十四年前，罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚共产党领导下所实现的武装起义的意义，也体现在标志着人民革命的开端的事实之中。这次革命保证了人民民主政权的建立以及工人阶级与其联盟者劳动农民夺取全部的政治权力。这就提供了过渡到人民革命，即社会主义革命的新阶段的可能性。
    我国解放以来的十四年是一个较短的历史时期。尽管如此，罗马尼亚在建设社会主义的事业中获得了重大成就。在这期间，罗马尼亚人民不但治好了战争的创伤，而且也把国民经济提到更高的社会主义水平上，使得工农业的生产和技术水平大大高于战前的水平。
    1957年，我国工业总产量增加为战前产量最高的一年——1938年的三点五倍。与1938年比较，1957年机器制造业的产量增加七倍多，电力七点四倍，化学工业八倍，建筑材料工业九倍，沼气十五倍。解放以前，我国国民经济所需的装备，95％是从国外输入的，而1957年机器输出量已超过了输入量。
    同时，罗马尼亚人民在农业的社会主义改造和机械化方面获得了重大成就。1958年初，我国拥有十一万台农业机器和重要的农业装备，其中有三万多台拖拉机。目前，我国社会主义农业部门占有本国农业面积的52％。从去年起，我国就有了完全集体化的第一批的许多县和一个州。
    总的来讲，我国农业产量大大超过了资产阶级地主政权下所达到的产量。1957年获得了一千一百万吨粮食，而1948年只有五百四十二万七千八百吨。
    由于工业和农业产量的增长，以及商品流通额的增长，劳动人民的生活水平与年俱增。1957年劳动人民的实际工资超过1950年48％。
    罗马尼亚人民在建设社会主义方面所获得的这一切成就，保证使罗马尼亚从一个落后的农业国家转变成为一个不断发展的先进的工农业国家。这一切成就是由罗马尼亚工人党领导的罗马尼亚人民的忘我劳动以及罗马尼亚人民共和国从苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家获得全面的兄弟般的援助的结果。
    罗马尼亚人民所获得的成就是与以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的存在和不断巩固密切相连的。罗马尼亚人民理解到，社会主义阵营团结的加强，是维护他们国家的独立和粉碎帝国主义侵略势力企图破坏罗马尼亚人民共和国的阴谋的主要保证，也是胜利而迅速地在本国建设社会主义的主要保证。因此，罗马尼亚人民驳斥和反对现代修正主义企图破坏社会主义阵营团结的任何阴谋。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府坚决奉行和平和国际合作的外交政策：主张发展与所有爱好和平的各国人民的友好联系。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家一道，坚决支持一切旨在缓和国际紧张局势、保证制止军备竞赛、禁止原子弹和保卫世界和平的一切倡议。罗马尼亚人民共和国政府和全体罗马尼亚人民谴责美国和英国对中近东各国人民的武装侵略，并要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出军队。
    愈来愈多的人们理解到，目前，和平的力量要比好战的帝国主义势力强大，东风压倒西风。
    在建设社会主义的事业中，罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间建立了以无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的真挚的兄弟般的合作关系；两国之间签订了文化、贸易、科学技术协定；这些协定是发展我们两国人民友好和合作关系的基础。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡率领的政府代表团今年到中华人民共和国所进行的友好访问，他们与中国国家和党的领导人的会谈以及与中国劳动人民的直接接触，对罗马尼亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊的加深和合作的更加密切，作出进一步的贡献。
    罗马尼亚人民以莫大的兴趣注视着伟大的中国人民在建设社会主义中所获得的成就。中国人民热火朝天地完成中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府所提出的关于在主要工业产品方面赶上和超过英国的任务，我们为此而感到高兴。中国人民最近在发展经济、技术、科学和文化方面所实现的大跃进，充分地证明，这些任务将会胜利地完成。
    中华人民共和国在国际舞台上促使各国人民之间的合作和保卫世界和平的作用正在日益增长。
    罗马尼亚人民以与伟大的中国人民的友谊而自豪，也以与伟大的中国人民一起都是以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营的成员而自豪，同时深信，我们共同的事业一定会获得胜利。
