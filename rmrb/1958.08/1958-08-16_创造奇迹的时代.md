　　The Era of Creating Miracles
　　Lin Ling
　　A miracle refers to something that is beyond human power and imagination. In the past, whether in China or abroad, there were records of miracles in books. Miracles were created by gods, immortals, and prophets. But of course, we later generations have no way to see those miracles, and in the past, there was no authoritative "Miracle Appraisal Committee" to review the miracles that occurred and make authoritative "appraisals" to make future generations believe without a doubt.

　　When the news came that wheat yields had reached three thousand catties per mu, the Chinese people were both surprised and delighted. Newspapers in capitalist countries did not believe that such a thing had happened, because there had been no such record of high yield in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. They said: Unless this is a miracle, they would never believe it.

　　When the wheat yield record reached five thousand catties per mu, it was spread as a miracle not only among foreigners, but also among our own people.

　　The new record of seven thousand catties should be a new miracle, but our people who have liberated their minds dare to think and speak, are not surprised by the strange, and are not surprised by the unusual, and regard miracles as ordinary things. This is also a natural phenomenon; in our great leap forward situation, we are "surprised several times a day." Amazing news is coming from every production front. Miracles are being created in almost every corner. We live in an era of people creating miracles themselves. There are so many miracles that they have become ordinary deeds.

　　Some daring people have put forward new targets: to create new records of 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 catties per mu of wheat next year.

　　Based on "strange news," some daring people estimated that early rice might reach a record of 10,000 catties per mu this year. But when the record of 10,000 catties was actually broken, and news of 15,000 and 16,000 catties appeared, the leaping and galloping people did not exclaim "stop," but regarded miracles as ordinary deeds.

　　People who are born in an era of creating miracles and create miracles themselves are not surprised.

　　But even when these miracles are not surprising, things that exceed the imagination of those who boldly imagine still appear, and everyone has to sigh at the real miracle: the Jianguo No. 1 Cooperative in Macheng, Hubei, created a miracle of 36,956 catties of early rice per mu!

　　Perhaps reporters in capitalist countries who only believe that God creates miracles do not believe in the facts created by our people? Our miracles have been appraised by the authoritative "Miracle Appraisal Committee": The yield of more than 36,900 catties from the Jianguo No. 1 Cooperative has been strictly determined after repeated measurement, calculation, and acceptance by responsible representatives of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and hundreds of people.

　　The miracles that have already appeared promote people to create new miracles, and new miracles promote people to create even newer miracles. This is the ordinary phenomenon of our era of creating miracles.

### 创造奇迹的时代

　　创造奇迹的时代
　　林陵
    所谓奇迹，是指不是人力所能做到，也不是人脑所能想像的事情。关于奇迹，过去在书本上，无论中外，都有记载。创造奇迹的是神仙、是先知。但是那些奇迹，我们生在后世的人，当然无法看到，过去也没有有权威的“奇迹鉴定委员会”把所发生的奇迹加以审查，作出权威的“鉴定”，使后人坚信无疑。
    当小麦亩产量达到三千斤的消息传出的时候，我国人民既惊奇叹息，也欢欣鼓舞。资本主义国家的报纸不相信有这样的事情，因为古今中外，没有过这样丰产的记载。他们说：除非这是奇迹，否则他们决不相信。
    当小麦亩产纪录达到五千斤的时候，不是在外国人中间，而是在我们本国人中间也当作奇迹的消息来奔走相告了。
    七千斤的新纪录应该是新的奇迹，但是我们解放了思想的人，敢想敢说，闻奇不奇，见怪不怪，把奇迹当成了平凡的事情。这也是必然的现象；在我们大跃进的形势中，“一日数惊”，从每条生产战线上传来惊人的消息，几乎在每个角落里都在创造奇迹，我们生活在人民自己创造奇迹的时代，奇迹是如此之多，多得变成平凡的事迹了。
    有些敢想敢做的人提出了新的指标：明年要创造小麦亩产一万、一万五、二万的新纪录。
    有些敢想敢做的人在“奇闻”的基础上，估计今年早稻可能出现亩产一万斤的纪录。可是当一万斤的纪录居然突破，并且出现一万五、一万六的消息时，跃进着的飞驰着的人并不叹为“观止”，而把奇迹当作平凡的事迹了。
    生在创造奇迹的时代，自己创造奇迹的人，是并不奇怪的。
    可是就在这种奇迹不奇的时候，居然又出现出于大胆设想的人们的想像之外的事情，大家就不得不叹为真的奇迹了：湖北麻城建国一社创造了亩产三万六千九百五十六斤早稻的奇迹！
    也许只相信上帝创造奇迹的资本主义国家的记者，又不相信我们人民创造的事实吧？我们的奇迹是经过权威的“奇迹鉴定委员会”鉴定的：建国一社三万六千九百多斤的产量是经过湖北省人民委员会、华中农业科学研究所、中共麻城县委负责代表和数百群众反复丈量、测算、验收而后严格确定的。
    已经出现的奇迹推动人们创造新的奇迹，新的奇迹又推动人们创造更新的奇迹，这就是我国创造奇迹时代的平凡现象。
