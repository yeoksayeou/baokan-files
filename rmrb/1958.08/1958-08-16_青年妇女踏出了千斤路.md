Title: Young Women Carve Out a Path to High Yields

　　The Wei River plateau in Shaanxi Province has always been perceived as having barren soil and low yields. However, in this very region, two young girls and a young woman in the Qifang Agricultural Cooperative of Zhao Village Township, Chengcheng County, have raised a red flag, creating a high-yield record of 1,022 jin per mu of wheat grown on previously cultivated land!

　　Last autumn, eighteen-year-old Lei Huifang graduated from elementary school. At that time, because her fiancé's family lacked labor (her fiancé was in the army), she, as the yet-to-be-married daughter-in-law, lived and worked in her fiancé's home. In the spring, the cooperative began rectification, and everyone was making a Great Leap Forward. The township Party committee also called on Youth League members to take the lead in developing experimental fields. Lei Huifang actively responded to the Party and League's call and, together with her neighbors and fellow League members, Wang Xiu'e and Yang Qingfang, developed more than three mu of high-yield experimental fields. When this news spread, some cooperative members took it as a joke. They said:
　　"It's only been a few days since they put down their pens, and they're already making a fuss about high yields!"

　　It was time for topdressing and spring irrigation. Before the cooperative acted, Huifang and her friends took up carrying poles and jars to collect liquid manure from the cooperative members' homes. The weather was hot, and the manure had a strong, foul odor. Qingfang and Xiu'e felt nauseous from carrying and pouring it. Huifang felt the same way, but she gritted her teeth and acted tough. In this way, they applied almost all of the liquid manure from the twenty-nine households in the team to the high-yield fields, and then irrigated them once.

　　When the wheat began to grow, the three of them spent their days in the fields weeding and hoeing. The cooperative members also began to complain: This is no good, if everyone did this, who would do the cooperative's work! Hearing these words, they certainly felt uncomfortable. Later, after discussing it, they decided to prioritize the cooperative's work and make time for the high-yield fields. They used their midday breaks and mealtimes to hoe the wheat five times and weed three times.

　　When the wheat was growing well, there was a sudden heavy frost. In a day or two, the crops withered and died. This was like a bolt from the blue. The three young women felt a chill in their hearts. In the field, Xiu'e and Qingfang began to cry first, and Huifang stood aside, shedding tears. Some young men saw them and deliberately taunted them: "The League members have no solution! Each of you grab a flowered quilt and cover the frost!" The kind-hearted old man Xu Chengzi came over and said to them: "Crying won't help. Watering them will do some good." They listened to old man Xu and watered the fields. Sure enough, the wheat revived. With careful management, the crops improved day by day.

　　In this way, their experimental fields finally achieved a bumper harvest. The three mu and seven fen of land yielded a total of more than 3,760 jin of wheat, more than eleven times the cooperative's average wheat yield per mu.

　　青年妇女踏出了千斤路
    陕西省渭北高原给人们的印象，总是土质瘠薄，产量不高。但是，就在这个地区，两个年轻的姑娘和一个青年妇女，却在澄城县赵庄乡齐放农业社插起一面红旗，创造了回茬小麦亩产一千零二十二斤的高额丰产纪录！
    去年秋天，十八岁的雷惠芳完小毕业了。当时因为婆家缺少劳力（爱人在部队工作），她这个没过门的媳妇，就住在婆家劳动了。春天，社里开始整风，人人都在跃进，乡党委也号召团员们要带头搞试验田。雷惠芳积极响应党团的号召，和邻家两个团员汪秀娥和杨青芳，搞了三亩多丰产试验田。这一风声传出后，有些社员却把它当成了笑话。他们说：
  “丢下笔杆子才几天，竟然也闹丰产了！”
    该是追肥、春灌的时候了。社里还没动手，惠芳她们便拿上扁担、罐子到社员家里去掐水茅。天气热，水茅臭味大，连抬带浇，青芳和秀娥的心里发恶心。惠芳也一样，可是她咬紧牙关装硬汉。就这样，她们几乎把全队二十九家的水茅粪，都浇到丰产地里；接着又灌了一次水。
    麦子起身了，她们三个整天钻在地里又锄麦，又拔草。社员们的意见也来了：这还行，要是都这样，社里的活要谁干！她们听到这话，心里的确不是味。后来一商量，先尽社里干，抽空再务丰产田。她们利用歇晌、吃饭的时间，先后锄麦五次，拔草三次。
    麦子正成长时，忽然下了一次大霜，一两天，庄稼便半死不活地枯了一地。这简直是晴天一声雷。三个女青年心里凉了半截。在地里，秀娥和青芳先哭了起来，惠芳也站在一边掉眼泪。一些男青年看见了，还故意挖苦她们：“团员还没办法！每人拿一条花被子，也把霜防住了。”好心肠的老汉徐成子走过来，对她们说：“哭不顶啥，浇上一水还抵些事。”她们听了徐老汉的话，浇了一水，果然，麦子又欢实起来。再加上细心的经营管理，庄稼一天一个样子。
    就这样，她们的试验田终于获得了丰收。三亩七分地，共打麦子三千七百六十多斤，超过全社小麦平均亩产量的十一倍。
