Amidst the nationwide upsurge of mass cultural creation, Shulu County in Hebei Province and Pixian County in Jiangsu Province have successively been transformed into mural counties. Tens of thousands of peasants, who for thousands of years had no right to pick up a paintbrush, are using their strong hands to create numerous pictures reflecting the soaring enthusiasm of the peasants in the Great Leap Forward. The mural creation in Shulu County began before the Spring Festival this year. Because the county committee personally led and deeply mobilized the masses, by the end of April, 49,145 murals had been painted, an average of 147 murals per village, realizing muralization throughout the county. In April, the Hebei Provincial Cultural Bureau held an "On-site Observation Meeting on Murals, Slogans, and Street Poetry" in the county to summarize experiences. According to statistics at the end of July, there were 95,000 murals in Shulu County, and a total of 150,000 people participated in the painting work. It can be said that everyone is involved, and every village is a gallery. Pixian County started its art work earlier. From 1955 to now, 180 art groups have been established throughout the county. From the beginning of this spring to the end of July, 23,000 murals and 15,000 posters have been painted. 108,000 people participated in the painting work, including 6,000 peasant painters. During the celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day this year, they also held an "Exhibition of Thousands of Peasant Art Works." The peasants' creative enthusiasm is extremely high. Their battle cry is that from August 1st to August 15th, the county's murals should reach 100,000, and the posters should reach 45,000.

These murals range in size from the largest covering five rooms to the smallest being two or three feet. Their common characteristics are: reflecting reality, cooperating with movements, and serving production. Many forms of expression are easy to understand, with a fresh and concise style, which can boost morale and inspire people. The masses in Tianjiazhuang, Shulu County said: "We have never seen our village so fresh in our lives. It is truly socialist. Let's work harder!"

The People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the Chinese Artists Association, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the "Fine Arts" magazine have all sent comrades to study their creations, preparing to edit collections of paintings, special issues, and hold exhibitions.

　　人人齐动手　村村是画廊
　　束鹿邳县两县壁画化
    本报讯　在全国群众文艺创作的高潮中，河北省束鹿县和江苏邳县已先后变成了壁画县。几千年来没有权利拿起画笔的成千上万的农民，用他们粗壮的手，创作了许许多多的图画，反映了农民在大跃进中的冲天干劲。束鹿县的壁画创作是从今年春节前开始的，由于县委亲自领导和深入发动群众，所以到4月底便绘制了壁画四万九千一百四十五幅，平均每村一百四十七幅，在全县实现了壁画化。4月间，河北省文化局在该县召开了“壁画、标语、街头诗现场参观会议”进行经验总结。到7月底统计，束鹿全县已有壁画九万五千幅，共有十五万人参加绘制工作，可以说是人人齐动手，村村是画廊。邳县的美术工作开展较早，1955年到现在全县已建立了一百八十个美术组。从今春开始到7月底已绘制了壁画二万三千幅，张贴画（即招贴画）一万五千幅。参加绘制工作的有十万零八千人，其中有六千位农民画家。在今年庆祝“八一”建军节时，他们还举办了“双千幅农民美术作品展览”。农民的创作热情高极了，他们的战斗口号是，从8月1日到8月15日，全县的壁画要达到十万幅，张贴画要达到四万五千幅。
    这些壁画，最大的有五间房一幅的，小的也有二、三尺一幅的。其共同的特点是：反映现实，配合运动，服务生产，许多表现形式是通俗易懂，有新鲜简练的风格，看后能壮人志、鼓人心。束鹿县田家庄的群众说：“活了这么大，咱村还没有这么新鲜过，真是社会主义了，加油干吧！”
    人民美术出版社、中国美术家协会、中央美术学院和“美术”月刊都派出同志下去研究他们的创作，准备编辑画集、专刊和举办展览。
