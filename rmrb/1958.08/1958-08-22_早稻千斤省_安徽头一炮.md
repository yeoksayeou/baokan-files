　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 21st: Our correspondent Mao Fojun reports: Anhui Province has achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of early rice this year, with the average yield per mu exceeding one thousand jin throughout the province.

　　This year, Anhui Province has completed the harvesting of 6,129,900 mu of early rice, yielding a total of 6,150,700,000 jin of dry rice, with an average yield of 1,003 jin per mu. The total output increased by 234% compared to last year, and the yield per mu increased by 175.5% compared to last year.

　　The characteristics of this year's bumper harvest of early rice in Anhui Province are: high yield, large area, and many "satellites." This year's early rice, whether in polder areas or hilly areas, whether in mountainous areas or plains, whether in old rice areas along the Yangtze River or new rice areas in northern Anhui, has generally achieved a bumper harvest. According to statistics, the province has seen a prefecture with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, Anqing Prefecture. The 2,500,000 mu of early rice in this prefecture has an average yield of 1,220 jin per mu. Twenty counties and cities throughout the province have emerged with yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu, including Tongcheng, Huaining, Langxi, Wangjiang, Zongyang, Taihu, Susong, Anqing City, Qingyang, Yuexi, Tongling, Lujiang, Xiuning, Nanling, Qianshan, Guichi, Shucheng, Xuancheng, Fanchang, and Lai'an. Among these counties and cities, Huaining County's 412,000 mu of early rice has an average yield of 1,439 jin per mu, with one season of early rice exceeding 31% of last year's total grain output; Langxi County's 120,000 mu of early rice has an average yield of 1,401 jin per mu, with the total output increasing more than eleven times compared to last year's early rice output; Tongcheng County's 453,000 mu of early rice has an average yield of 1,485 jin per mu, with the total output nearly doubling last year's total output.

　　Eighty-four townships throughout the province have also emerged with an average yield of more than 1,500 jin per mu; 253 agricultural cooperatives have emerged with an average yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu; and eleven agricultural cooperatives have emerged with an average yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu. Among them, Xingfu Township in Langxi County achieved particularly astonishing increases in early rice production this year. The 16,450 mu of early rice in the entire township has an average yield of 3,008 jin per mu, with one season of early rice exceeding the total grain output of the entire township in the past three years. The Quhu Production Team of the Fushan Cooperative in Zongyang County, which planted more than 50 mu of double-cropping early rice this year, has an average yield of 6,000 jin per mu, with the total output increasing nearly twenty times compared to last year's early rice output.

　　This year's early rice in Anhui Province is not only generally and widely high-yielding, but also has a particularly large number of high-yield "satellites." The province has a total of 79,708 mu with a yield of 3,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, and 15,541 mu with a yield of 5,000 to 10,000 jin per mu; there are eleven large "satellite" fields with more than 10,000 jin, totaling 19.56 mu. It is particularly worth mentioning that the new rice area in northern Anhui, which used to be "nine years of failure out of ten," has also launched two high-yield early rice "satellites." These two "satellites" were launched by the Chumiao Cooperative in Mengcheng County and the Wolong Cooperative in Suixi County. The former has a yield of 6,588 jin per mu, and the latter has a yield of 6,395 jin per mu, with one season of rice exceeding the local dry grain output by more than a hundred times.

　　The comprehensive and unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice in Anhui Province this year is not accidental, but is the result of relying on the masses of the people, using "emptiness" to drive "reality," and carrying out resolute struggles against various right-leaning conservative ideas under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction and under the correct leadership of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China; it is the result of the people of the entire province working hard throughout the winter and spring, building water conservancy projects on a large scale, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, and close planting; it is the result of a major fight against drought.

　　This year's bumper harvest of early rice in Anhui Province was not smooth sailing. This year's climate in Anhui Province was not favorable, and from seedling cultivation to harvesting, extremely arduous struggles were waged against cold waves, pests, and droughts. This year, Anhui Province also experienced droughts that had not occurred in decades. For more than three consecutive months, no soaking rain fell in various parts of the province. The Provincial Party Committee promptly put forward the fighting slogan of "Guaranteeing a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought," mobilizing more than 10 million people to launch a widespread and sustained drought resistance and seedling protection movement with the spirit of despising the heavens and enraging the Dragon King. Starting from transplanting seedlings, they fought hard for more than three consecutive months, resisting drought until rice harvesting, and finally overcame the drought and won a bumper harvest of early rice.

　　Now, the people of Anhui Province are riding the waves, working with greater energy, seizing the time to cultivate and topdress, strengthening field management, striving for greater harvests of mid-season rice, late rice, and autumn crops, and actively preparing for next year's production, striving for a greater leap forward next year.

### 早稻千斤省  安徽头一炮

　　早稻千斤省  安徽头一炮
    据新华社合肥21日电  本社记者冒茀君报道：安徽省今年早稻获得空前大面积丰收，全省早稻平均亩产超过千斤。
    今年安徽省六百一十二万九千九百亩早稻已收割完毕，共收干稻六十一亿五千零七十万斤，平均单产达一千零三斤。总产量比去年增加了234％，单产比去年提高了175.5％。
    今年安徽省早稻大丰收的特点是：产量高，面积大，卫星多。今年的早稻，不论是圩区和丘陵地区，不论是山区和平原，不论是沿江的老稻区和淮北的新稻区，普遍获得了大丰收。据统计：全省出现了一个亩产一千斤以上的专区，安庆专区，这个专区的二百五十万亩早稻，平均亩产达一千二百二十斤。全省出现了桐城、怀宁、郎溪、望江、枞阳、太湖、宿松、安庆市、青阳、岳西、铜陵、庐江、休宁、南陵、潜山、贵池、舒城、宣城、繁昌、来安等二十个亩产千斤以上的县市。在这些县市中，怀宁县全县四十一万二千亩早稻，平均亩产一千四百三十九斤，一季早稻就超过了去年全年粮食总产量31％；郎溪县十二万亩早稻平均亩产一千四百零一斤，总产量比去年早稻总产量增加了十一倍还多；桐城县四十五万三千亩早稻平均亩产一千四百八十五斤，总产量超过去年全年产量将近二倍。
    全省还出现了平均亩产一千五百斤以上的乡共八十四个；平均亩产两千斤以上的农业社共二百五十三个，平均亩产三千斤以上的农业社共十一个。其中郎溪县的幸福乡今年早稻增产特别惊人，全乡一万六千四百五十亩早稻，平均亩产达三千零八斤，一季早稻比过去全乡三年粮食产量的总和还要多。枞阳县浮山社的曲湖生产队，今年全队种的五十多亩双季早稻，平均亩产达六千斤，总产量比去年早稻总产量陡增将近二十倍。
    安徽省今年的早稻不仅普遍大面积丰产，高产“卫星”也特别多。全省亩产在三千到五千斤的共有七万九千七百零八亩，亩产在五千斤到一万斤的有一万五千五百四十一亩；万斤以上的大“卫星”田共有十一处，共十九亩五分六厘。特别值得提出的是，过去曾经是“十年九不收”的淮北新稻区，也放出了两颗早稻高产“卫星”。这两颗“卫星”是蒙城县的褚庙社和濉溪县的卧龙社放出的，前者亩产是六千五百八十八斤，后者亩产六千三百九十五斤，一季稻超过当地旱粮产量百倍以上。
    今年安徽省早稻获得全面的空前的大丰收，不是偶然的，而是在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，在中共安徽省委的正确领导下，依靠了人民群众，以虚带实，向各种右倾保守思想开展坚决斗争的结果；是全省人民大干一冬一春、大兴水利、大量积肥、密植的结果；是大抗旱的结果。
    安徽省今年早稻丰收并不是一帆风顺的。今年安徽省的气候，风既不调，雨也不顺，从育秧到收获，曾和寒潮、虫害、干旱进行了极其艰苦的斗争。安徽省今年还发生了几十年来没有过的干旱，全省各地连续三个多月未下透雨，省委及时提出了“大旱一年保丰收”的战斗口号，动员了一千多万人以藐视天公，气死龙王的气概掀起了广泛持久的抗旱保苗运动，从栽秧开始，连续苦战三个多月，抗旱一直抗到收稻，终于战胜了干旱，赢得了早稻大丰收。
    现在安徽全省人民正乘风破浪，鼓足更大干劲，抓紧中耕、追肥，加强田间管理，争取中稻、晚稻、秋收作物的更大丰收，并积极为明年生产作好准备，争取明年来个更大的飞跃。
