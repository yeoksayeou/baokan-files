　　Protest Against the Provocative Acts of the British Authorities in Hong Kong
　　On August 26, the British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched a large number of armed police to forcibly close the Hong Kong Chinese Middle School, and wantonly beat the school's teachers and students and the Chinese journalists who were present to cover the event. The news aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. This is another criminal act by the British authorities in Hong Kong in their hostility towards the Chinese people. We express our strong protest against this.
　　The persecution of the Chinese Middle School by the British authorities in Hong Kong is not an isolated incident. This is part of a planned action by the British authorities in Hong Kong to deliberately destroy the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. As early as the beginning of January this year, the British authorities in Hong Kong, regardless of the firm opposition of the education circles and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, forcibly promulgated a reactionary "Education Ordinance," and then carried out a series of persecutions against the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. On February 1, under the pretext of violating the "Education Ordinance," two staff members of the literacy class run by the Qingshan branch of the Planting Association were convicted, and at the same time, some other literacy classes were unreasonably searched. On May 1, using the absurd excuse that the "Education Ordinance" prohibits schools from hanging so-called "political and semi-political" flags, they brazenly and unreasonably interfered with the hanging of the Chinese national flag by nine schools, including Han Hua Middle School. On May 10, Xin Qiao Middle School was prohibited from hanging the Chinese national flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on its school anniversary. On July 29, under the pretext of "dilapidated school buildings, unsuitable for classes," Wenming School was ordered to suspend classes. On August 6, Du Bo Kui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, was unreasonably deported. All these interferences and persecutions are carried out under the guise of "politics should not be involved in schools," but in reality, they attempt to prevent the Chinese from loving their motherland and prohibit the schools of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon from conducting patriotic education. On the other hand, the British authorities in Hong Kong allow schools run by American and Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong to hang the flags of the Chiang Kai-shek clique every day, and allow Chiang's agents and "teachers" to wantonly carry out political propaganda that slanders China. In particular, the British education authorities in Hong Kong have even stipulated that schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon should use textbooks published in Taiwan and by American and Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong. What are their intentions? Isn't it obvious? What "politics should not be involved in schools" is clearly playing a political conspiracy to create "two Chinas."
　　The British authorities in Hong Kong's destruction of the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon is by no means accidental, but is another concrete manifestation of the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong's consistent pursuit of the United States' hostility towards New China and the Chinese people.
　　Under the protection and connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong, American and Chiang Kai-shek agents have been using Hong Kong as a base for various sabotage activities against our country. The British authorities in Hong Kong even tacitly allow the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to use Hong Kong as a base for armed harassment of the Chinese mainland. Recently, in order to cooperate with the United States and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, in creating tension in the Far East and the Taiwan Strait, Britain not only allowed American troops to land in Singapore, but also turned Hong Kong into a transit point for American troops, and even dispatched its own military aircraft stationed in Hong Kong to invade our country's airspace for reconnaissance and harassment. It is in this very serious situation that the British authorities in Hong Kong have instigated armed police to wantonly beat unarmed Chinese teachers, students, and journalists. The Chinese people cannot but regard this atrocity as a blatant and deliberate provocation by the British authorities in Hong Kong.
　　Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent two notes to the British government on August 27, lodging serious protests against the British military aircraft's invasion of our country's airspace and the British authorities in Hong Kong's destruction of the education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the instigation of police to beat Chinese teachers, students, and journalists. This represents the angry voice of the 600 million Chinese people, and we fully support it. We also want to warn the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong: the Anglo-American imperialists' aggressive actions in the Middle East have been defeated under the counterattack of peace-loving countries and people all over the world; if the British government attempts to cooperate with American imperialism to continue to create tension in the Far East, then it is certain that it will not have a good ending either. Until now, the Chinese people have shown the greatest patience towards a series of hostile actions by the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, but the Chinese people's patience cannot be unlimited. If the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong continue to provoke the Chinese people, they must be prepared to bear all possible consequences.

### 抗议香港英国当局的挑衅行为

　　抗议香港英国当局的挑衅行为
    8月26日香港英国当局派出大批武装警察，强行封闭香港中华中学校舍，并且肆意殴打该校师生和在场采访的中国新闻记者。消息传来，激起了中国人民的莫大愤慨。这是香港英国当局敌视中国人民的又一件罪恶行径。我们对此表示严重的抗议。
    香港英国当局对于中华中学的迫害，并不是一个孤立事件。这是香港英国当局蓄意摧残港九中国人民爱国教育事业的有计划行动的一部分。早在今年1月初，香港英国当局就不顾港九教育界和各界人士的坚决反对，强行颁布了一个反动的“教育条例”，接着就对港九中国人民的爱国教育事业进行了一连串的迫害。2月1日，以违犯“教育条例”为借口，对种植公会青山支会所办的识字班两个工作人员判罪，同时又对另外一些识字班进行了无理搜查。5月1日，又以“教育条例”中有一项禁止学校悬挂所谓“政治性和半政治性”旗帜的规定作为荒谬的借口，蛮横无理地干涉汉华中学等九所学校悬挂中国国旗。5月10日，又禁止新侨中学在校庆日悬挂中国国旗和唱中国国歌。7月29日，又以“校舍残旧，不宜上课”为名，勒令文明学校停课。8月6日又将培侨中学校长杜伯奎无理递解出境。这一切干涉和迫害，都以所谓“政治不应介入学校”为幌子，实际上企图不准中国人爱自己的祖国，禁止港九中国人民的学校进行爱国主义的教育。而另一面，香港英国当局却容许香港的美蒋特务主办的学校天天悬挂蒋介石集团的旗帜，容许蒋帮特务“教师”肆意进行诬蔑中国的政治宣传。特别是香港英国教育当局竟规定港九学校采用台湾和美蒋特务在香港出版的教科书作为课本。居心何在，难道还不明显吗？什么“政治不应介入学校”，明明是在玩弄制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋。
    香港英国当局摧残港九中国人民的爱国教育事业，绝不是偶然的，而是英国政府和香港英国当局一贯追随美国敌视新中国和敌视中国人民的又一个具体表现。
    在香港英国当局的包庇和纵容之下，美蒋特务分子一直利用香港作为巢穴，对我国进行种种破坏活动。香港英国当局更默许台湾蒋介石集团以香港为基地对中国大陆进行武装骚扰。最近，为了配合美国和它的走狗蒋介石集团在远东和台湾海峡制造紧张局势，英国不仅允许美国军队在新加坡登陆，而且把香港变为美国军队的集散地，甚至派遣自己驻扎在香港的军用飞机侵犯我国领空，进行侦察和骚扰。正是在这种十分严重的情况下，香港英国当局竟又唆使武装警察对手无寸铁的中国师生和新闻记者肆意殴打。中国人民不能不把这次暴行看作是香港英国当局露骨的和蓄意的挑衅。
    我国外交部已经在8月27日向英国政府发出两个照会，对于英国军用飞机侵犯我国领空和香港英国当局摧残港九中国人民的教育事业和唆使警察殴打中国师生和新闻记者，分别提出严重抗议。这代表了六万万中国人民愤怒的呼声，我们完全支持。我们还要警告英国政府和香港英国当局：美英帝国主义在中近东的侵略行为，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的反击下，已经遭到了挫败；如果英国政府企图配合美国帝国主义继续在远东制造紧张局势，那么，可以肯定它也绝不会有什么好的下场。直到现在为止，中国人民对于英国政府和香港英国当局一系列的敌意行为，表现了最大的忍耐，但是，中国人民的忍耐不能是没有限度的，如果英国政府和香港英国当局继续对中国人民挑衅，他们就必须准备着承担一切可能的后果。
