    The Power of Indigenous Methods

    The successful trial production of hot-rolled gears proves the power of indigenous methods once again.

    Some people believe that indigenous methods are always backward and are a measure of last resort, and will eventually be replaced by foreign methods. The success of hot-rolling gears using indigenous methods is a good education for these people. What are indigenous methods? All methods that originate from China's specific conditions are indigenous methods. Among these indigenous methods, some are indeed relatively backward from a purely technical point of view; some are technically advanced (such as hot-rolled gears, and Li Shimei's termite control). Of course, as the country's economic situation and technological development change, these indigenous methods will continue to develop, change, and improve. Some will improve, some will be eliminated; this is the law of development. But those that have improved are still indigenous methods, still originating from China's specific conditions.

    Any foreign method that is not combined with China's specific conditions is of no use. Indigenous experts must absorb nourishment from foreign methods to enrich indigenous methods and use indigenous methods to master the world's new technologies. Foreign experts must face China's specific conditions and cultivate foreign methods in China's soil.

### 土办法的威力

    土办法的威力
    热轧齿轮试制成功，土办法的威力又一次得到证明。
    有些人以为土办法总是落后的，是不得已而求其次的措施，终久会被洋办法代替。用土办法热轧齿轮成功，对这些人是一个很好的教育。什么叫土办法？一切从中国具体情况出发产生的办法都是土办法。在这些土办法中，有些单从技术上看确是比较落后的；有些即便在技术上也是先进的（如热轧齿轮、李始美治白蚁）。当然，随着国家经济情况、技术发展情况的变化，这些土办法也还会继续发展变化和提高。有些是提高了，有些会淘汰；这是事物的发展规律。但提高了的，也还是土办法，还是从中国具体情况出发的。
    一切洋办法不同中国的具体情况相结合，是没有什么用处的。土专家要从洋办法中吸取养料，丰富土办法，用土办法掌握世界新技术。洋专家要面向中国的具体情况，把洋办法栽培在中国的土壤里。
