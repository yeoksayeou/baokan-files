Stage and Screen

    The long novel "Bitter Vegetable Flowers," which is popular with the broad masses of readers, has been adapted by the China Ping Opera House and is being staged in Beijing. The script is basically written according to the development of the characters and plot of the original work. It better reflects the original work. Throughout the performance, the scenes of Xingmei's sacrifice and her mother's unyielding spirit are particularly moving to the audience. Comrade Xicai Chun, who plays the mother, gives a touching performance here. (Lan)

    评剧“苦菜花”
    受到广大读者欢迎的长篇小说“苦菜花”，已经由中国评剧院改编，在北京上演。剧本基本上是按照原著人物情节的发展来编写的。它较好的表现了原著的面貌。在整个演出中，星梅就义和母亲不屈这两场戏，特别使观众感动。饰演母亲的喜彩春同志，在这里有着感人的表演。　（兰）
