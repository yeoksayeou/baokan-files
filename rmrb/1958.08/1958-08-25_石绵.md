　　Asbestos
    Asbestos is a fibrous mineral, cool in nature, capable of absorbing moisture from the air, and possesses properties such as insulation, heat resistance, fire prevention, and thermal insulation, making it widely used in industry. All factories and equipment requiring thermal insulation, heat resistance, and fire prevention, as well as transportation vehicles such as trains, automobiles, ships, and airplanes, require it. Asbestos fibers are classified as tough, soft, and friable. Tough asbestos, after processing, resembles silk floss or cotton and can be woven into asbestos cloth or asbestos rope. Friable asbestos is processed into powder and used as a raw material for asbestos building materials. Asbestos is also a good raw material for plastic factories; it can be used as a substitute for steel and non-ferrous metals.

　　石绵
    石绵是纤维状的矿产，性阴凉，能吸收空气中的水分，具有绝缘、抗热、防火、保温等性能，在工业上的用途很广。凡是需要保温、抗热、防火的工厂和设备，以及火车、汽车、轮船、飞机等交通工具，都要用它。石绵的纤维有坚韧、柔软和脱嫩之分。坚韧的石绵加工后像丝棉、棉花一样，可以纺织成石绵布、或石绵绳，脱嫩的石绵加工变成粉末，可作石绵建筑材料的原料。石绵又是塑料工厂的好原料，它可以做钢材和有色金属的代用品。
