Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: New York dispatch: An editorial published by the "Wall Street Journal" on August 8th expressed concern that the so-called "indirect aggression" theory, fabricated by the U.S. ruling group to cover up its aggressive actions, could not deceive world public opinion.

　　This editorial, on the one hand, defended this "indirect aggression" fallacy, but at the same time admitted that it was difficult to justify. The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower used the pretext of "indirect aggression" against Lebanon to send troops to Lebanon, but the United Nations observer group reported that it had found no indirect aggression in Lebanon. The newspaper wrote: "Who is the world most likely to believe is telling the truth? It would be wise for Washington to ask itself this question."

　　The newspaper continued: "Now let's look at Iraq. If what happened there was what we call indirect aggression, then since we recognized the successful rebel government, couldn't others accuse us of endorsing this indirect aggression?"

　　The editorial said, "The greater danger is that this weapon (referring to the 'indirect aggression' fallacy) may be used against us." The editorial said, "We are deliberately stretching our imagination as far as possible when we raise the question of what indirect aggression might entail," but "the world's diplomatic circles are full of imaginative people, ... and they will be very happy to use our own words against us."

### 美国“华尔街日报”承认　“间接侵略”谰言站不住脚

　　美国“华尔街日报”承认
　　“间接侵略”谰言站不住脚
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：“华尔街日报”8日发表的一篇社论表示担心：美国统治集团为了掩饰自己的侵略行动而制造的所谓“间接侵略”理论，欺骗不了世界舆论。
    这篇社论一方面为这种“间接侵略”的谰言进行辩解，但是同时又承认这很难自圆其说。报纸指出，艾森豪威尔借口有人对黎巴嫩进行“间接侵略”而出兵黎巴嫩，但是联合国观察团却报告说它在黎巴嫩没有发现什么间接侵略。报纸写道：“世界上的人最有可能相信谁说得对？华盛顿这样问一问自己是明智的。”
    报纸又说：“现在且来看看伊拉克。假如那里发生的事情是我们所说的间接侵略，那么由于我们承认了获得成功的叛乱政府，别人难道不能够指责我们赞同这种间接侵略么？”
    社论说，“更大的危险在于：这件武器（指‘间接侵略’的谰言）可能被人用来对付我们”。社论说，“我们在提出关于间接侵略可能具有什么含义的问题时，是故意尽可能放纵我们的想像的”，但是，“世界各国外交界是充斥着富于想像力的人的，……他们是会很乐意地用我们自己的话来反对我们的”。
