He pointed out the achievements of the province-run local industry in producing daily necessities and food.

He emphasized the need to develop a diversified economy in rural areas, develop animal husbandry, beekeeping, sericulture, and use mountain fruits and wild vegetables to produce various foods.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. The Korean Cabinet recently adopted a decision to improve the level of agricultural mechanization, stipulating that the area of mechanized cultivation should be expanded to more than 500,000 chongbo (approximately 15 mu per chongbo) during the first five-year plan.

The decision stipulates that 21 more agricultural machinery service stations will be added before the end of this year. Before 1961, two new tractor repair and assembly plants will be built, and starting this year, the construction of various factories producing agricultural machinery, farm tools, ox carts, and handcarts will be increased.
