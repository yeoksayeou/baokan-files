　　Not Losing the True Colors of Steel Capital
    "Providing charcoal in snowy weather" and "selfless devotion to others" have always been praised as virtues in Chinese history. In the long years of class existence, although its meaning was greatly limited, it still shone like a pearl in the desert, forever radiating brilliance. The great revolution of the working people buried the exploiting class along with its egoistic philosophy. On the new social foundation, the communist style of "one for all, all for one" is rapidly growing. It shines brilliantly, like the sun illuminating the earth. The deeds of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Seamless Steel Tube Plant published here today are just one of the thousands of such annotations.
    In order to help others in need, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Seamless Steel Tube Plant dug out their beloved two sets of small tube rolling mills, which they had personally manufactured and were about to put into production, from the concrete foundations and generously supported fraternal enterprises in the Southwest region, and also sent workers to help install and teach operating techniques. They also expressed their determination to complete the leap forward plan of increasing production by 87% compared to last year under the condition of reduced machinery and equipment. Truly, they do not lose the true colors of the working class, nor do they lose the true colors of the steel capital!
    The workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant said it well that in the past, all parts of the country supported them, and now they should also fully support other regions. This sentence embodies the spirit of mutual dependence and cooperation of "one for all, all for one." The great leap forward in national industry and the complete realization of the national plan are naturally unimaginable without this spirit of cooperation.

　　不失钢都本色
    “雪里送炭”、“舍己为人”，在我国历史上从来就被传为美德。在有阶级存在的漫长的岁月里，尽管它的含义有很大局限性，却仍然像沙漠里的珍珠，永远闪着光彩。劳动人民的大革命，把剥削阶级连同它的利己主义哲学一起埋葬。在新的社会基础上，“我为人人、人人为我”的共产主义风格正迅速成长起来。它光芒万丈，像普照大地的太阳。今天登在这里的鞍钢无缝钢管厂的事迹，正是千千万万的这样注脚之一。
    为着济人之急，鞍钢无缝钢管厂的职工，把自己亲手制造的心爱的两套眼看就要投入生产的小型轧管机，从混凝土基础里刨出来，慷慨地支援西南地区的兄弟企业，还要派工人去帮助安装和传授操作技术。他们并且表示要在机器设备减少的条件下，完成比去年增产87％的跃进计划。真是不失工人阶级的本色，不失钢都的本色！
    无缝钢管厂的工人说得好，过去全国各地支援他们，现在他们也应该全力支援其他地区。这句话，体现了“我为人人、人人为我”的相互依存的协作精神。全国工业的大跃进，国家计划的完满实现，离开了这种协作精神，自然是不可想像的。
