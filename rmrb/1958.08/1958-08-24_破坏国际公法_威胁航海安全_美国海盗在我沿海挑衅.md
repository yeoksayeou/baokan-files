　　Violating International Law, Threatening Navigation Safety
　　American Pirates Provoke on Our Coasts
　　Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd. A dispatch from United Press International reporter Hanson, filed on the evening of the 21st from the American Seventh Fleet destroyer "USS McDermut," reveals that the ships of American imperialism are intensifying provocative activities along our mainland coast, seriously threatening our security.
　　This American reporter traveled with the "USS McDermut" from a port in southern Taiwan, which the United States has seized as a naval base, crossing the South China Sea. Hanson wrote: "Steaming back and forth along the Communist coast (referring to the Chinese mainland coast) is what is called the Taiwan Patrol," "it patrols to within twelve miles of the Chinese Communist mainland." This American destroyer "entered Condition Three, or a state of semi-combat readiness, several hours before beginning its patrol southwest of Jinmen Island." "One five-inch gun was ready to fire at any moment, and a twin three-inch anti-aircraft gun was also ready to fire. Torpedoes and depth charges placed on the stern deck could be launched within minutes of an order being issued." This aggressive warship "sailed north, conducting a patrol of more than one hundred miles."
　　The dispatch quoted war cries from the captain of this American destroyer, William Hoppy, who openly provoked the Chinese people. This American lieutenant colonel stationed in Taiwan said: "Our mission is to observe any Chinese forces showing signs of invading Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and to provide reports. We must be prepared to repel these forces. We maintain surveillance of navigation, aerial contacts, and submarine contacts in the Taiwan Strait, and we follow instructions to help train the Chinese Nationalist Navy."
　　The American reporter also said that this American Seventh Fleet ship patrolling the Taiwan Strait "is very busy, checking fishing boats." At the same time, "occasionally approaching a freighter from Hong Kong, an oil tanker from the Persian Gulf, or a ship from a country doing business with Communist China late at night," the American warship forces these merchant ships to "identify themselves." For years, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have been constantly engaging in pirate activities in the Taiwan Strait, robbing merchant ships from many countries and our country's fishing boats, and killing large numbers of sailors and fishermen. The United States has tried every possible way to deny these crimes of violating international law and threatening maritime safety. This United Press International dispatch once again confirms the piratical activities of American warships in the Taiwan Strait, checking and questioning fishing boats and merchant ships.

### 破坏国际公法　威胁航海安全  美国海盗在我沿海挑衅

　　破坏国际公法　威胁航海安全
    美国海盗在我沿海挑衅
    新华社23日讯　合众国际社记者汉森21日晚上从美国第七舰队
  “麦克德谟号”驱逐舰上发出了一则消息，表明美帝国主义的舰只在我国大陆沿海加紧进行挑衅性的活动，严重威胁我国的安全。
    这个美国记者随“麦克德谟号”从台湾南部美国侵占为海军基地的港口出发，横过南中国海。汉森写道：“在共产党沿海（指中国大陆沿海）驶来驶去，就是所谓台湾巡逻”，“它巡逻到离中国共产党大陆十二英里以内的地方”。这艘美国驱逐舰“在金门岛西南海面开始巡逻以前几小时，就进入第三级状态，即半战斗准备状态”。“有一门五英寸口径的大炮随时准备发射，同时有一门三英寸口径的双筒高射炮也随时准备发射。设置在后甲板上的鱼雷和深水炸弹在命令发出几分钟以后就能放射”。这艘侵略舰只“向北行驶，进行了一百多英里长的巡逻”。
    消息中引用了这艘美国驱逐舰舰长威廉·霍皮公然向中国人民挑衅的战争叫嚣。这个侵台美军中校说：“我们的任务是观察有迹象表示要进犯台湾和澎湖群岛的任何中国部队，并且提供报告。我们必须准备好击退这些部队。我们保持监视台湾海峡中的航行，空中的接触和潜水艇的接触，我们遵照指示帮助训练中国国民党的海军。”
    这个美国记者还说，这艘在台湾海峡巡逻的美国第七舰队舰只“是很忙的，它要检查渔船”。同时，“偶然在深夜驶近一艘来自香港的货船，一艘来自波斯湾的油船或者一艘来自某个同共产党中国做生意的国家的轮船”，美国军舰就要强迫这些商船“表明自己的身份”。几年来，美国和蒋介石集团不断在台湾海峡进行海盗活动，抢劫了许多国家的商船和我国的渔船，杀害了大批海员和渔民。美国曾百般企图洗脱这些破坏国际公法威胁航海安全的罪行。合众国际社这条消息，又一次证实了美国军舰在台湾海峡检查、盘问渔船、商船的海盗活动。
