Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 10th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said here on the evening of the 10th that the first issue the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting must consider is the withdrawal of foreign troops from West Asia, followed by other matters. According to the Press Trust of India, Nehru told the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting on the eve of the House of the People session that although the danger of war has subsided with the convening of the UN General Assembly meeting, the situation remains critical. If serious and sincere efforts are not made to resolve the Middle East conflict, the situation may worsen. He said India is prepared to offer any help that can facilitate the resolution of the problem.

Nehru said that although he personally does not intend to attend the United Nations General Assembly meeting in person, he will consider whether he should go in person or have India send someone else if the situation requires it later.

　　尼赫鲁说西亚局势仍然危急
　　联大应先讨论美英撤军问题
    新华社新德里10日电　印度总理尼赫鲁10日晚上在这里说，联合国大会紧急会议必须考虑的第一个问题将是从西亚撤出外国军队的问题，接着再考虑其它事情。据印度统一通讯社报道，尼赫鲁在人民院会议前夕在国大党议会党团会议上说，虽然随着联大会议的召开，目前的战争危险已经减退，但是局势仍然是危急的。如果不作出认真的真诚的努力来解决中东冲突，局势还可能更加恶化。他说，印度准备提供任何可以促进问题解决的帮助。
    尼赫鲁说，虽然他个人不打算亲自出席联合国大会会议，但是如果以后情况有需要，他将考虑是应该亲自前往，还是由印度派遣其他的人前往。
