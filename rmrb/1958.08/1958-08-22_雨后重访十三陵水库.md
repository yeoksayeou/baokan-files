Re-visiting the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir After the Rain
    Chen Yi

　　Re-visiting after the rain, the reservoir is full of water, the wind blows and the ripples stretch long.
　　The mountain torrents tested the quality and it is good, the masses are truly kings of construction.
　　The finishing work is complicated and much, the crowds at the construction site still shuttle back and forth.
　　Not allowing this huge project to fall short, we sing together the song of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains.
　　The dam stands horizontally like a towering mountain, let us see the mountain torrents roll in.
　　It is no exaggeration to say that a hundred rivers can be blocked, turning the decayed into the miraculous is genius.
　　Reaching here again is like riding a celestial raft, the red glow over Nankou is halfway to heaven.
　　We should be amazed at the change in China's face, from the Kunlun Mountains to the edge of the sea.
　　Some deeply sigh and think of the times of Emperors Yao and Shun, which is nothing more than being lost in the ancients and deluding oneself.
　　The outskirts of Beijing used to be stony and sandy land, labor creates abundant rice and fish.
　　Too much water is harmful, scarcity is a disaster, disasters have always been unsolvable.
　　The people control the water and the nature of water changes, rice, wheat, beans and millet are planted everywhere.
　　Legend has it that Yu the Great could control water, diverting the nine rivers is close to boasting.
　　Today, millions of people control the water, we should know that later sages surpass former sages.
　　The rightists once said there were no achievements, construction is everywhere, what do you say now?
　　Reports during the wheat season were the most fruitful, the Five-Year Plan was completed in one year.
　　World affairs are renewed as expected, the turning point of transformation is not difficult.
　　For example, the Great Leap Forward of today, one year surpasses hundreds of years.
　　Drawing a line as a prison that cannot be crossed, those grinding ink in the old paper piles.
　　As long as the mind is greatly liberated, the people are truly all-powerful.
　　Narrating but not creating is固迷古, searching for chapters and picking out phrases is 教条.
　　Concrete practice is fundamental, theoretical generalization knows the far and remote.
　　Literature and art in the countryside bloom splendidly, science and technology in the countryside resemble painted pottery.
　　Last night I happily received new news, philosophy has sprouted in the countryside.
　　The Great Leap Forward in urban industry, the technological revolution is new every day.
　　The combination of workers and peasants promotes each other, the division between mental and physical labor will be difficult.
　　Being diligent and cautious all day long, waiting for the rooster to crow in the dark and stormy night.
　　Putting politics in command is truly outstanding, construction values people more than things.
　　Able to play Go and good at making "eyes" (strategic points), today water "eyes" are all over the outskirts of Beijing.
　　The number of water "eyes" across the country is countless, the ingenious layout is superb.
　　The imperial tombs are surrounded by mountains, repairing tombs and digging tombs is done by others.
　　Passers-by compare the present with the past with deep emotion, and surely say that the reservoir is not a false statement.
　　The construction Great Leap Forward is heroic across the country, let him doubt and wait to see.
　　The most convincing thing is the facts, steel, grain, coal and electricity are rising like a tide.

　　雨后重访十三陵水库
    陈毅
　　雨后重访水满塘，风吹波动涟漪长。
　　山洪考验质量好，群众真是建设王。
　　扫尾工作繁且多，工地人群仍穿梭。
　　不将巨工亏一篑，齐唱愚公移山歌。
　　如山高耸堤横排，试看山洪滚滚来。
　　百川能障非虚语，化得腐朽是奇才。
　　重到已似乘仙槎，南口天半泛红霞。
　　应惊中国面貌改，昆仑山到海之涯。
　　几人深慨想唐虞，无非迷古复自迷。
　　京郊旧是石沙地，劳动创造富米鱼。
　　多水为害缺即灾，自来灾害解不开。
　　人民治水水性变，稻粱麦菽到处栽。
　　传说大禹能治水，疏导九河近夸言。
　　今日治水千万众，应知后贤过前贤。
　　右派曾说无成绩，建设遍地汝何言。
　　报到麦季最丰硕，五年计划一年完。
　　世事翻新如预料，转变关头舵不难。
　　例如而今大跃进，一年胜过数百年。
　　划地为牢不可逾，故纸堆中磨墨人。
　　只要思想大解放，人民群众真万能。
　　述而不作固迷古，寻章摘句乃教条。
　　具体实践是根本，理论概括知远遥。
　　文艺农村花烂漫，科技农村似彩陶。
　　昨夜喜得新消息，哲学农村已露苗。
　　城市工业大跃进，科技革命日日新。
　　工农结合互推动，劳心劳力将难分。
　　终日乾乾齐蹈厉，风雨如晦待鸡鸣。
　　政治挂帅真卓绝，建设重物更重人。
　　能下围棋善做眼，今日水眼遍京郊。
　　全国水眼数不尽，妙手布局着着高。
　　众山环抱帝王陵，修墓挖墓自有人。
　　过客多情比今古，定言水库不虚陈。
　　建设跃进举国豪，让他怀疑等着瞧。
　　最能说服是事实，钢粮煤电涨如潮。
    　　        一九五八年七月
