Widespread Use of Electricity to Replace Labor
　　A Nationwide Upsurge in Rural Electrification is Coming
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 16th: The first National Rural Hydropower Conference, hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, proposed that under the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture across the country, rural hydropower development must accelerate to create a rural electrification upsurge at the same time as a water conservancy upsurge. The representatives attending the conference advocated launching a mass movement this winter and next spring to achieve preliminary rural electrification in "five counties and one hundred communes" per province (region). Each province (region) should select five counties and one hundred agricultural communes to achieve preliminary electrification first, establishing a clear banner of electrification and setting an example for future large-scale development.
    The conference determined that the guiding principle for preliminary rural electrification is: mainly small-scale, production-oriented, commune-run, comprehensive planning, combined utilization of various energy sources, mainly hydropower, relying on the masses, and running stations diligently and thriftily; giving equal importance to power and electricity, emphasizing both construction and management, and earnestly implementing the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical. The scope of rural electrification refers to the use of electricity in county, township, and commune industrial and agricultural production, as well as for the daily lives of the masses. The standards for preliminary electrification are:
    1. At the county level, an average of 100 to 150 watts of electricity per household should be reached;
    2. For production processes that can be replaced by electricity, such as water lifting for irrigation, threshing, rice milling, flour milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning, grass cutting, feed processing, and other agricultural and sideline product processing, 60% to 80% should use electricity or power-driven machinery;
    3. Small-scale industries below the county level should mainly use electricity for power.
    After the preliminary electrification of the entire country's rural areas is achieved, the national countryside will obtain 15 million to 18 million kilowatts of electricity, with an annual power generation of 37.5 to 45 billion kilowatt-hours. Calculated at eight laborers replaced per kilowatt of electricity, a total of 120 million to 140 million laborers can be saved annually nationwide, equivalent to about half of the existing labor force. Achieving this goal will mean that our country will victoriously embark on the road of preliminary rural electrification, transforming agriculture to a modern large-scale production technological foundation.
    The conference pointed out that the construction of rural hydropower stations in our country is advancing with a great leap forward pace this year. Before 1957, the total number of hydropower stations built across the country was about 500, with a capacity of more than 20,000 kilowatts. According to incomplete statistics from the first half of this year, 3,872 new small power stations have been built, with a capacity of 35,228 kilowatts. Together with hydropower stations under construction, the total number is about 14,500, with a total capacity of more than 200,000 kilowatts, equivalent to ten times the total capacity built by the end of 1957. Due to the high enthusiasm of the masses in automatically investing in materials preparation, many of the new power stations built this year have been completed and generating electricity in a matter of days or dozens of days. The construction of hydropower stations has greatly liberated the rural labor force and has become an urgent demand of the masses after the great leap forward in production.
    The conference lasted for nine days and closed on the 9th. Representatives from provinces, cities, autonomous regions and relevant departments of the central government attended the conference.

　　广泛用电力代替劳力
　　全国将掀起农村电气化高潮
    据新华社天津16日电　由农业部主持召开的全国第一次农村水电会议，提出在全国工农业大跃进的形势下，农村水力发电事业必须快马加鞭，在全国掀起水利化高潮的同时，掀起农村电气化的高潮。出席会议的代表，倡议今冬明春展开一个每省（区）实现
  “五县百社”农村初步电气化的群众运动，各省（区）根据具体情况，选择五个县和一百个农业社首先实现初步电气化，树立起鲜明的电气化旗帜，为今后的大发展作出榜样。
    会议确定农村初步电气化的方针是：以小型为主，生产为主，社办为主，全面规划，结合利用各种能源，以水电为主，依靠群众，勤俭办站；动力与电力并举，兴修与管理并重，认真贯彻多快好省的精神。农村电气化的范围是指县、乡、社工农业生产和群众生活用电。初步电气化的标准是：
    一、以县为单位，平均每户达到一百到一百五十瓦电的水平；
    二、凡能用电力代替的生产过程，如提水灌溉，脱谷、碾米、磨面、榨油、轧花、铡草、饲料加工及其他农副业加工等，能有60％到80％使用电力或动力带动；
    三、县以下小型工业的动力主要使用电力。
    实现全国农村初步电气化以后，全国农村将得到一千五百万到一千八百万瓩的电力，年发电量三百七十五到四百五十亿度。以每瓩电代替八个劳动力计算，全国每年共可节约一亿二千万到一亿四千多万劳动力，相当于现有劳动力的一半左右。达到这个目标，我国就会胜利地走上农村初步电气化的道路，把农业转到现代化大生产的技术基础上去。
    会议指出：我国农村水电站的建设，今年是以大跃进的步伐前进的。1957年以前，全国建成的水电站总数约有五百多处，容量二万多瓩。根据今年上半年的不完全统计，新建成小电站三千八百七十二处，容量三万五千二百二十八瓩。连同正施工的水电站，总数约达一万四千五百多处，总容量二十多万瓩，相当于1957年底建成总容量的十倍。由于群众热情高涨，自动投资备料，今年新建的许多电站都是几天、几十天就建成发电的。水电站的修建，大大地解放了农村的劳动力，并成为生产大跃进后群众的一项急迫的要求。
    这次会议历时九天，已在9日闭幕。出席会议的有全国各省、市、自治区和中央有关部门的代表。
