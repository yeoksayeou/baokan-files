　　Enthusiasm High as the Yellow River Waves: Henan and Hebei Launch Friendship Competition for a Great Leap Forward

　　Our Newspaper Reports: A vigorous and magnificent revolutionary friendship competition is unfolding in the two adjacent provinces of Henan and Hebei.

　　This competition was initiated by Linzhang and Anyang counties, which border each other in the two provinces. In 1957, although the wheat yield of the Qingchun Cooperative in Linzhang County, Hebei Province, was similar to that of Anyang County in Henan, its cotton yield was much lower: Anyang County produced more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, while Qingchun Cooperative only produced more than 60 jin. The cadres and members of the Qingchun Cooperative were very dissatisfied with this situation and were determined to exert their efforts and strive for the top, putting forward the bold slogan of "Learn from Henan, Catch up with Henan," and launched a revolutionary competition with the Fenge Township and other agricultural cooperatives in Anyang County. They overcame various difficulties and finally created a miracle in this year's wheat production, achieving the first round of victory: the average wheat yield this year increased nearly four times compared with last year, with the highest yield reaching more than 3,600 jin per mu. They are also continuing to compete with the agricultural cooperatives in Fenge Township in cotton production.

　　The revolutionary spirit of the Qingchun Cooperative in daring to compete with advanced agricultural cooperatives in fraternal provinces, striving for the top, and striving for first place has attracted the attention of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which decided to launch a revolutionary competition movement of "Learning from Henan, Catching up with Henan" throughout the province. The Hebei Daily also published an editorial entitled "Set High Aspirations, Establish Great Ambitions, Strive for the Top, and Strive for First Place," and later opened a special column "Learning from Henan, Catching up with Henan, Striving for the Top, and Striving for First Place," which continuously reported on the vigorous "Learning from Henan, Catching up with Henan" situation in the Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Handan, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Tianjin and other regions of Hebei.

　　To meet the challenge of the people of Hebei, a movement of "Learning from the heroic people of Hebei and competing with the heroic people of Hebei" is now being launched in Henan Province. The people of Henan have put forward new combat tasks: to strive for the top, to strive for first place, to accelerate steel production; to strengthen autumn field management, eliminate third-class seedlings, and ensure a bumper autumn harvest; to completely eliminate the "four pests" and strive to obtain the first national "Four-No Red Flag," and so on.

　　On August 15, the Henan Daily reported the news of the competition between Henan and Hebei on a full page, and published an editorial entitled "Learn from the heroic people of Hebei and compete with the heroic people of Hebei," to encourage the fighting will of the people of Henan.

　　热情高似黄河浪  并肩向前大跃进
    河南河北展开友谊竞赛
    本报讯  一个轰轰烈烈、规模壮阔的革命友谊竞赛运动，正在河南和河北两个相邻的省份展开。
    这场竞赛，开始是由两省相邻的临漳、安阳两县掀起的。1957年，河北省临漳县青春社的小麦和河南安阳县的产量虽然差不多，但棉花产量却比安阳县低了很多：安阳县每亩产皮棉一百多斤，青春社只产六十多斤。青春社的干部和社员对这样一个现状很不满意，决心鼓足干劲，力争上游，提出了“学河南，赶河南”的豪迈口号，同安阳县丰乐镇等几个农业社展开了革命竞赛。他们克服了各种困难，终于在今年的小麦生产中创造了奇迹，取得了第一个回合的胜利：今年小麦平均产量比去年提高近四倍，最高的亩产达到三千六百多斤。他们还在棉花生产上继续和丰乐镇的农业社开展竞赛。
    青春社这种敢于同先进的兄弟省的农业社开展竞赛，力争上游，力争第一的革命气魄，引起了中共河北省委的重视，决定在全省范围内开展“学河南，赶河南”的革命竞赛运动。河北日报也以“树雄心，立大志，力争上游，力争第一”为题发表了社论，以后又开辟了“学河南，赶河南，争上游，争第一”的专栏，连续报道了河北石家庄、保定、邯郸、承德、张家口、唐山、天津等专区轰轰烈烈地“学河南，赶河南”的情况。
    为迎接河北人民的挑战，目前，在河南省又掀起了一个“向英雄的河北人民学习，和英雄的河北人民竞赛”的运动。河南人民又提出了新的战斗任务：要力争上游，力争第一，要加速钢铁生产；加强秋田管理，消灭三类苗，确保秋季大丰收；要全歼“四害”，争取得到全国第一面“四无红旗”等等。
    8月15日，河南日报以一版整版的地位报道了河南、河北展开竞赛的消息，并发表了“向英雄的河北人民学习，和英雄的河北人民竞赛”的社论，鼓舞河南人民的战斗意志。
