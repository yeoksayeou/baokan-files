Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from New York: In light of the current severe crisis in the Middle East, many articles published in American newspapers are demanding that the government soberly assess the existing situation and re-examine its policies. These newspapers believe that a new U.S. Near East policy should be based on recognizing the neutrality of Arab countries.

    “New York Herald Tribune” commentator Walter Lippmann wrote that the United States should make it clear at the summit meeting: “We (the United States) do not intend to restore the past; we do not intend to remain unchanged; we believe that a period of long-term negotiations on a new order in the Middle East has now begun.”

    “Washington Post and Times Herald,” while pointing out that the current Near East policy of the U.S. government is unrealistic, emphasized: "Peace in the Middle East cannot be restored by Secretary of State Dulles' new guarantees to the Baghdad Pact member states."

    The “New York Herald Tribune” published a dispatch from Beirut by reporter Nadin, saying that if the United States and Britain do not change their policies, they will find it increasingly difficult to resist the pressure to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

    Nadin wrote: "At this critical juncture, the West should not limit itself to getting rid of this unpleasant situation... Since we obviously cannot stop the tide of nationalism, we should reach an agreement with them and announce relevant policies at the summit meeting."

    Nadin suggested that the West should not oppose Arab neutrality and advocated restricting the transfer of weapons to the region. Nadin pointed out that the Iraqi revolution "has destroyed the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine at once," fundamentally changing the situation in the Arab East. He admitted that he put forward such a plan in order to help the West "salvage the remaining positions and property in the Arab world."

    Nadin went on to admit that the puppet regimes in the Arab East will not last long, especially the situation of King Hussein of Jordan, whose days in power are "numbered." Nadin said: "Therefore, when the British army withdraws, the best help Britain can give Hussein is to transport him to Cyprus by plane."

    Nadin concluded: "If Britain's relationship with the countries in the Persian Gulf region can adapt to the current situation, instead of permanently maintaining a semi-colonial state, then its hopes of maintaining oil interests there will be much greater... But from my recent contacts with Lebanese opposition figures, I can see that the difficulty lies in: when it comes to 'independence,' we mean one thing, while the Arabs mean something completely different. What we mean by independence is independence under the protection of the West, while the Arabs believe that independence is independence under the protection of neutrality.”

### 一些美报要求政府改变中东政策  另搞政治阴谋挽救殖民利益

    一些美报要求政府改变中东政策
    另搞政治阴谋挽救殖民利益
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：鉴于目前中近东的严重危机，美国报纸发表的许多文章都要求政府清醒估计现有局势，并且重新审查自己的政策。这些报纸认为，美国新的近东政策应当以承认阿拉伯各国的中立为基础。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼写道，美国在最高级会议上应该明白表示：“我们（美国）不打算恢复过去；我们不打算原封不动，我们认为现在已经开始了一个就中东新秩序进行长期谈判的时期”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在指出美国政府现行的近东政策不现实时强调说：“中东的安宁不能靠国务卿杜勒斯支持巴格达条约成员国的新保证而得到恢复。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”刊载了记者纳丁发自贝鲁特的一篇通讯说，如果美国和英国不改变自己的政策，它们将越来越难于抵抗要它们从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退的压力。
    纳丁写道：“在这个紧要关头，西方不应当仅限于摆脱这种不愉快的境遇就算了事……既然我们显然无法阻止民族主义的浪潮，我们就应当同它们达成协议，并且在最高级会议上宣布有关的政策。”
    纳丁建议西方不要反对阿拉伯中立，并且主张限制向这个地区输送武器。纳丁指出，伊拉克的革命“已经一下子摧毁了巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义”，根本改变了阿拉伯东方的局势。他承认，他是为了帮助西方“挽救在阿拉伯世界残存的阵地和财产”，才提出这样的计划来的。
    纳丁接着承认，阿拉伯东方傀儡政权的寿命是不长的，约旦国王侯赛因的情况尤其如此，他在位的日子已经“屈指可数”。纳丁说：“因此，在英国军队撤出时，英国能够给侯赛因最好的帮助莫过于用飞机把他运到塞浦路斯。”
    纳丁最后写道：“英国同波斯湾地区的国家的关系如果能够顺应目前的局势，而不是永远保存半殖民地状态，那末它能够在那里保持石油利益的希望就会大得多……但是我从不久前我同黎巴嫩反对党人士的接触中看出，困难在于：谈到‘独立’的时候，我们所指的是一回事，而阿拉伯人所指的却完全是另一回事。我们所指的独立是在西方保护下的独立，而阿拉伯人却认为独立是在中立的保护之下的独立。”
