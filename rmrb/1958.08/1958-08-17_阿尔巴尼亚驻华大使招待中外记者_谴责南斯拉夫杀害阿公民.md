Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: Albanian Ambassador to China, Balili, strongly condemned and protested the crime of Yugoslavia in plotting to kill Albanian citizen Hasan Spata at a press conference held this afternoon for Chinese and foreign journalists. He denounced the Yugoslav government's bandit-like and barbaric behavior, which violates international law and human morality.

Ambassador Balili said, "We firmly oppose the barbaric behavior of the Yugoslav government. Our people and every upright person in the world feel extremely indignant at this behavior."

Ambassador Balili pointed out that the Yugoslav government's inhumane persecution of foreign nationals is a violation of international law. If they still cannot give a definite answer to the Albanian government's just demands for the immediate return of the deceased's body, compensation for the deceased's family, and punishment of the culprits, "then they will bear full responsibility for all the consequences and will be condemned by world opinion." The ambassador said, "All upright people and public opinion in the world are on our side."

Ambassador Balili told reporters that Hasan Spata, holding an official Albanian passport and a Yugoslav transit visa, passed through Belgrade from West Germany at the end of May this year, preparing to return to his country, when he was secretly kidnapped by the Yugoslav authorities on the evening of May 27. Although the Albanian government and its embassy in Yugoslavia repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Yugoslav government during this period, demanding the release of Hasan Spata, the Yugoslav authorities secretly killed Hasan Spata on August 7. The ambassador pointed out that the course of events fully proves that "this Albanian citizen was murdered on the orders of high-level Yugoslav organs." Ambassador Balili sternly refuted all the shameless excuses made by the Yugoslav government in an attempt to evade responsibility.

　　阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使招待中外记者
　　谴责南斯拉夫杀害阿公民
    新华社16日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使巴利里在今天下午举行的中外记者招待会上，强烈地谴责和抗议南斯拉夫阴谋杀害阿尔巴尼亚公民哈桑·斯帕塔的罪行。他痛斥南斯拉夫政府这种违反国际法和人类道德的强盗式的野蛮行为。
    巴利里大使说：“我们坚决反对南斯拉夫政府的野蛮行为。我国人民和世界上每个正直的人对这种行为都感到无比愤恨”。
    巴利里大使指出，南斯拉夫政府非人道地迫害外国侨民的行为是违反国际法的。如果他们现在还不能确切地答复阿尔巴尼亚政府关于立即交回死者尸体、赔偿死者家属损失和惩办祸首等正义要求，“那他们将对一切后果负全部责任，并将受到世界舆论的谴责。”大使说：“世界上一切正直的人民和舆论都站在我们这一边。”
    巴利里大使告诉记者，哈桑·斯帕塔在今年5月底持有阿尔巴尼亚的正式护照和南斯拉夫的过境签证从西德路过贝尔格莱德准备回国时，在5月27日晚上被南斯拉夫当局秘密绑架。虽然阿尔巴尼亚政府和它驻南斯拉夫公使在此期间曾一再向南斯拉夫政府提出严正抗议，要求释放哈桑·斯帕塔，但南斯拉夫当局竟在8月7日暗中将哈桑·斯帕塔杀死。大使指出，这件事实的过程充分证明“这位阿尔巴尼亚公民是由南斯拉夫高级机关命令杀害的”，巴利里大使严厉地驳斥了南斯拉夫政府企图推脱罪责的种种无耻借口。
