Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 27th. More than six thousand educators and students from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a rally at the Guangzhou Gymnasium this morning. They protested the Hong Kong British authorities' atrocities of destroying Chinese people's education in Hong Kong, assaulting teachers and students of the Chung Wah Middle School, and Chinese journalists. They resolutely supported the just struggle of the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School and demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities must apologize, punish the murderers, compensate for all losses, and guarantee that similar barbaric acts will not occur in the future.

Zhou Dazhou, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Education Trade Union, and Ruan Jingqing, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Education Trade Union, spoke successively, expressing their cordial greetings to the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School who were fighting for the patriotic education cause, and to the news reporters who were unreasonably beaten. They pointed out that the deliberate destruction of Chung Wah Middle School, which has a history of thirty-three years, is an attack by the Hong Kong British authorities on the entire Chinese education cause and another provocation against the 600 million Chinese people. They warned the Hong Kong British authorities that they must immediately stop such provocative behavior.

Du Bokui, the former principal of Hong Kong Pui Kiu Middle School, who had worked in education in Hong Kong for twelve years and was unreasonably deported by the Hong Kong British authorities twenty days ago, used concrete facts to expose the crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities. He said that Chung Wah Middle School repeatedly expressed its willingness to repair the school buildings and requested the approval of the Public Works Bureau, but the Hong Kong British authorities delayed and refused to allow the repairs, while using the police to forcibly close the school buildings. This proves that it deliberately used "dangerous buildings" as an excuse to destroy our people's education cause.

The conference received many letters of sympathy from teachers and students of various schools to the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School. These letters expressed that the education circles and people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the just struggle of the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School.

This afternoon, more than 6,000 teachers and students from 33 universities, middle schools, and primary schools in the Eastern District of Guangzhou also held a rally in Dongjiaochang in the rain, unanimously demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities apologize, punish the murderers, compensate for all losses, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Wu Junyi, chairman of the Eastern District Teachers' Trade Union, angrily pointed out at the meeting that the era of imperialist rampant hegemony is gone forever. The 600 million Chinese people who have stood up are resolutely fighting against the Hong Kong British authorities' crimes of destroying Chinese education in Hong Kong, infringing on personal freedom, and restricting the freedom of Chinese journalists to interview.

　　广东教育界一万多人集会
    坚决支持香港同胞的正义斗争
    新华社广州27日电　广东省、广州市教育界人士和学生六千多人，今日上午在广州体育馆举行集会，抗议香港英国当局摧残香港中国人民教育事业、殴辱中华中学师生和中国新闻记者的暴行，坚决支持中华中学师生的正义斗争；并且要求香港英国当局必须道歉、惩办凶手、赔偿一切损失，保证今后不再发生类似的野蛮行为。
    广东省教育工会副主席周大洲和广州市教育工会副主席阮镜清先后发言，对为爱国教育事业而斗争的中华中学师生和无理被殴打的新闻记者表示亲切的慰问。他们指出：有三十三年历史的中华中学这次受到蓄意摧残，是香港英国当局对整个中国教育事业的进攻，是对六亿中国人民的再一次挑衅。他们警告香港英国当局，必须立即停止这种挑衅行为。
    曾在香港从事教育工作十二年、二十天以前被香港英国当局无理递解出境的前香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎，用确切的事实揭穿了香港英国当局的罪行。他说：中华中学一再表示愿意修理校舍，并提请工务局批准，但香港英国当局一面拖延不准修建，一面却用警察强行封闭校舍，这证明它是蓄意以“危楼”作借口来摧残我国人民教育事业。
    大会收到许多学校师生寄给中华中学师生的慰问信。这些慰问信表示：广东省、广州市教育界和人民，和全国人民一道，坚决支持中华中学师生的正义斗争。
    广州市东区三十三所大、中、小学六千多师生，今日下午也在东较场冒雨举行集会，一致要求香港英国当局道歉、惩凶、赔偿一切损失，并保证以后不再发生同类的事件。东区教师工会主席吴均仪在会上愤怒地指出：帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了，已经站起来的六亿中国人民坚决地为反对香港英国当局摧残香港中国教育事业、侵犯人身自由限制中国记者采访自由的罪行而斗争。
