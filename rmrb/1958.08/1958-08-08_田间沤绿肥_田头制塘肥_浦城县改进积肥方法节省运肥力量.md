Pucheng County Improves Fertilizer Accumulation Methods, Saving Fertilizer Transportation Labor

(Xinhua News Agency) Pucheng County, Fujian Province, is implementing field-head pond fertilizer production and field green manure composting, which is a good experience.

Pucheng County is mostly mountainous, evergreen year-round, and has an inexhaustible supply of green manure. However, due to the large amount of cultivated land and lack of labor, and the scattered small hills and plots, fertilizer accumulation and transportation required excessive labor. Therefore, although fertilizer sources were abundant, very little fertilizer was applied. This has become a long-term problem in the county. Farmers also complained that they had fertilizer but no time to accumulate it. They said, "If we could make fertilizer in the fields, we could apply as much fertilizer as possible."

During the Double Anti-Double Comparison movement, farmers in Shipi Town in the county launched a competition for more, faster, better, and more economical production and construction, and successively created methods for field-head pond fertilizer production and field green manure composting. The town's 8,300 mu of land had an average of one pond for every 28 mu, and five green manure composting pits for every mu. The town's average fertilizer application reached 43,000 jin per mu, an increase of 45 times compared to the same period last year. More than 3,000 mu of low-yield land in the town previously received an average of less than five dan of topdressing. This year, basic fertilizer was applied to every plot, and the annual average fertilizer application per mu could reach 600 dan. After the county party committee promptly organized cadres throughout the county to conduct on-site observations and quickly promoted the experience of Shipi Town, the fertilizer accumulation situation greatly changed. According to statistics from the past few days, the county's fertilizer accumulation and production has reached an average of 1,285 dan per mu, including an average of 424 dan of liquid green manure per mu. Green manure pits and artificial urine ponds are scattered throughout the fields, totaling 11.25 million, and the fertilizer quality has generally improved. The shortage of nitrogen fertilizer has been basically changed, and the contradiction of fertilizer transportation in mountainous areas has also been resolved.

The method of field-head pond fertilizer production is to first select a high place in the field and dig a dry pond, so as to facilitate the transportation of fertilizer into the field and prevent water accumulation and seepage. At the same time, consider the water source, and it is ideal to introduce water from the high place into the pond. The shape and size of the dry pond can be determined according to actual needs, but digging deeper can save labor and occupy less ground. The bottom of the pond should be compacted to prevent water seepage and fertilizer leakage. Use bamboo or wood to make beams on top of the pond, cover it with thatch, and leave one or two openings for stirring and removing fertilizer. Thicken the mud on the top of the pond, which can promote fertilizer decomposition and also be used to grow bean crops. When making fertilizer, fill the pond with water, crush the sulfur, oil cake, and dry and hardened cattle and pig manure in advance, and pour them into the pond together with other raw materials. Stir well, seal the pond opening, stir it every three to five days, and it will ferment and decompose in about ten days.

The method of field green manure composting is to dig several pits in a field (determined according to the amount of fertilizer used), about one chi deep, and the shape and size are not limited. When making fertilizer, pour tender leaves, green grass, oil cake, lime and other raw materials into the pit, fill it with water, and it will decompose in seven or eight days, becoming black liquid green manure. In spring, it is best to compost in batches according to the order of rice transplanting in the field. For example, before the last plowing and harrowing, dig the fertilizer pits and start filling them. When plowing and harrowing, the fertilizer in the pit has decomposed, and the fertilizer is evenly spread throughout the field to serve as base fertilizer.

The advantages of these two fertilizer production methods are:

(1) The method is simple and easy, and is not restricted by season or location. As long as there is a water source, it can be done. Green manure pits are more flexible and can be composted directly in the field. Make it whenever you need it, and use whatever material you have.

(2) It greatly saves the labor of transporting fertilizer from distant fields. Making a large number of fertilizer ponds and green manure pits scattered in the fields solves the difficulty of supplying fertilizer to distant mountain fields. According to calculations: 100 dan of fertilizer per mu of land, using these two fertilizers only requires three workdays for accumulation and carrying. If using mountain ash and other fertilizers, it would take at least 20 workdays. Thus, the county saves 4.45 million workdays. Saving this labor is of great significance for intensive cultivation in mountain fields.

(3) Adapt measures to local conditions and match materials according to the field. Raw materials can be flexibly matched according to different environmental conditions, fertilizer needs, and soil conditions. It is inconvenient to transport fertilizer to distant fields, so compost more green manure. Use some sulfur and gypsum for deep-footed cold water fields with low soil temperature. Add more leaves, cow manure, oil cake, etc. to thin, infertile drainage fields and fields with compacted soil. Use more tea seed cake for fields with serious insect pests.

(4) High fertilizer efficiency and great potential. According to chemical analysis, the nitrogen content of field green manure compost and field-head pond fertilizer is 2.5%; the phosphorus content is 10% and 8% respectively; and the potassium content is 40% and 50% respectively.

(Xinhua News Agency) Yichang, Xiangyang, and Jingzhou prefectures in Hubei Province are carrying out a fertilizer accumulation and production campaign centered on making local chemical fertilizers and building fertilizer mounds at the field head. According to statistics, more than 75,000 local chemical fertilizer plants have been established in these three prefectures. Yichang and Xiangyang prefectures alone have produced 11.75 million dan of various local chemical fertilizers.

Field-head fertilizer mounds are large mounds built on the edge of every five or ten mu of land, capable of composting from more than 100 dan to nearly 1,000 dan of fertilizer. Various green grasses, lake grasses, and miscellaneous fertilizers are placed in the mounds for a period of time to become good fertilizers. More than 2 million such field-head fertilizer mounds have been built in these three prefectures.

    田间沤绿肥  田头制塘肥
    浦城县改进积肥方法节省运肥力量
    本报讯  福建省浦城县实行田头制塘肥、田间沤绿肥，是一项好经验。
    浦城县大都是山区，四季长青，有取用不尽的绿肥。但因耕地多劳力缺，山田小丘分散，积肥运肥花工过大，所以虽然肥源丰足，而施肥极少。这已经成为该县长期不能解决的矛盾。农民也抱怨有肥料没工夫积，他们说：“要能把肥料造在田里，施肥再多也有办法。”
    双反双比运动中，这县石陂镇农民开展了多快好省的生产建设竞赛，先后创造了田头制塘肥和田间沤绿肥的办法。全镇八千三百亩土地平均每二十八亩搞了一个塘，每一亩又搞了五个沤绿肥的窖。全镇平均每亩施肥已达四万三千斤，比去年同期增加四十五倍。该镇的三千多亩低产田往年追肥平均不足五担。今年基本作到丘丘下基肥，全年平均每亩施肥可达六百担。县委及时组织全县干部实地观摩并迅速推广了石陂镇的经验后，积肥情况大为改变。截至最近几天统计，全县积肥造肥每亩平均已达一千二百八十五担，其中水绿肥每亩平均四百二十四担。田间的绿肥窖和人造尿塘星罗棋布，共有一千一百二十五万个，肥料质量普遍提高，氮肥不足情况基本改变，山区运肥矛盾也得到解决。
    田头制塘肥的办法是：先选田头高处，挖制枯塘，以便于运肥入田，又不致积水渗透。同时要考虑到水源，能把高处的水引入塘内最为理想。枯塘形状大小可根据实际需要，但挖深些可省工又少占些地面。塘底夯实防水渗入也防漏肥，塘上面用毛竹或木头作梁，盖上茅草，留一两个口，以便搅拌和出肥。塘顶加厚泥，既可促使肥料腐熟，还可兼种豆类作物。制肥时塘内灌满水，把硫磺、油饼和干结牛猪粪预先打碎，与其他原料一齐倒入塘内，搅匀封盖塘口，隔三、五天搅拌一次，约十天发酵沤熟。
    田间沤绿肥的制法是在一丘田里挖几个窖（按用肥量来定），窖深一尺左右，形状大小不拘。制肥时把嫩叶青草、油饼、石灰等原料倒入窖内，灌水使满，经七、八天就会腐熟，成为乌黑的水绿肥。春季沤制最好按本田插秧先后分批制造。例如在最后一次翻土耙田之前，就挖好肥窖，开始装肥，待翻耙时，窖内肥料已沤熟，耙田的同时肥料就均匀地撒布全田充作基肥。
    这两种制肥方法好处有：
    （1）作法简易，不受季节和地点的限制，只要有水源就可以。绿肥窖更灵活，可以直接沤在田里。什么时候需要就什么时候作，有什么料就利用什么料。
    （2）大大节省远田送肥的劳动。把大量肥塘和绿肥窖星罗棋布地作在田头，就解决了山田远途供肥困难。据计算：一亩田下一百担肥，用这两种肥料连积带挑只需三个工日，如果用山灰等其他肥料，至少需二十个工日，而全县因此即节省出了四百四十五万个工。而这些劳力节省下来对山田精耕细作具有很大的意义。
    （3）因地制宜，看田配料。根据不同的环境条件、需肥条件和土壤条件可以灵活配料。远田运肥不便可多沤绿肥，土温低的深脚冷水田就用些硫磺、石膏，土质浅瘦的排田和土壤板结的田，就多配些树叶、牛粪、油饼之类，虫害严重的田地可多用些茶饼等。
    （4）肥效高，潜力大。根据化验分析，田间沤绿肥和田头塘肥含氮量为2.5％；含磷量分别是10％、8％；含钾量分别是40％、50％。
    据新华社讯  湖北宜昌、襄阳、荆州三个专区正在开展以制土化肥、修田头粪垱为中心的积肥造肥运动。据统计，这三个专区已开办了七万五千多个土化肥厂。仅宜昌、襄阳两专区就生产出各种土化肥一千一百七十五万担。
    田头粪垱就是在每五亩或十亩的一片田边，修一个能沤肥一百多担到近千担的大垱，把各种青草、湖草和杂肥放到垱里沤一些时候便成很好的肥料。这三个专区已建设了这样的田头粪垱二百多万个。
