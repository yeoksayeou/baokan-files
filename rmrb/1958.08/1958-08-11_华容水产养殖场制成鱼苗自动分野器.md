　　Huarong Aquatic Product Farm
　　Manufactures Automatic Fish Fry Sorting Device
　　(Our Newspaper) Technicians Zhang Guiqi and Liao Yunqing of the state-owned Huarong County Aquatic Product Farm in Hunan Province, based on the inertial movement of domestic and wild fish, created an "automatic fish fry sorting device," increasing the efficiency of fish fry sorting by twenty-five times. (Note: The process of separating carnivorous and ferocious fish such as *鰔, 鲢, 桂鱼* from the fish population to avoid harming other fish later is called "sorting.")
　　According to the farm's experience, using the old method of sorting fish fry in ponds, each person could only sort more than 166,000 fish fry per day. Based on the farm's production of 40 million domestic fish fry this year, it would take eight technicians a month to complete the sorting. However, using the automatic fish fry sorting device, one million fish fry can be sorted each time. Because the sorting time is shortened, the mortality rate of fish fry is correspondingly reduced.

### 华容水产养殖场制成鱼苗自动分野器

　　华容水产养殖场
　　制成鱼苗自动分野器
    本报讯　湖南省华容县国营水产养殖场技工张桂其、廖云清，根据家野鱼活动的惯性，创造了“鱼苗自动分野器”，使鱼苗分野工效提高二十五倍。（注：把小鱼苗中具有肉食性的凶残的鱼如鰔、鲢、桂鱼等，从鱼群中分离出去，避免以后伤害其他鱼类，这个工作叫着“分野”）
    根据该场经验，用旧法在池子里分野鱼苗，每人每天只能分鱼十六万六千多尾。按该场今年生产四千万尾家鱼苗，以八个技工来算，需要分野时间一个月。但利用鱼苗自动分野器每次即可以分鱼苗一百万尾。由于分野时间缩短了，相应地降低了鱼苗的死亡率。
