    The Policy of the Rockefeller Dynasty
    Soviet Union A. Leonidoff

    I
    As the realities of the 20th century demonstrate, the characteristic of the era of capitalist decline is that the major bourgeois states have become a unique kind of billionaire empire. Republics and monarchies alike have met with the same fate. The establishment of new forms of governance has neither consulted the people nor been approved by Congress. The emergence of financial empires is determined by the laws of capitalist economics themselves. The concentration of capital has produced industrial monopoly capital and financial oligarchies headed by super-capitalist billionaires. These super-capitalists control the majority of national wealth: natural resources, means of production, and monetary capital. Because of this control, the power they wield is no less, but even greater, than that of the feudal monarchs of old.
    Bourgeois democracy is increasingly becoming a fiction. In reality, it is not ministers and presidents who give orders, but the emperors of financial empires. The most powerful bourgeois congressmen, administrators, and military leaders have all become attached to them. The policies of these new rulers, both domestic and foreign, in essence serve one purpose: to seize unprecedentedly huge profits. Hundreds of millions of capital generate hundreds of millions of profits at breakneck speed. Future historians will record with astonishment how fantastic a way of life capitalism produced in its dying days. But contemporaries have the opportunity to confirm that it is the interests of these uncrowned emperors, the billionaires, that primarily determine the daily policies of the contemporary bourgeois world.
    Of all the billionaire dynasties in power in this world, the most powerful is the Rockefeller dynasty. Currently, it controls shares in companies worth $60 billion. This amount is 50% more than the national income of France. No other family of financial oligarchs possesses so much wealth or exerts so much influence on the leaders of Western governments. Countless facts show that current U.S. policy is often a concentrated expression of the interests of the Rockefeller dynasty. Nelson Rockefeller, one of the members of this dynasty and former assistant to President Eisenhower, personally confirmed this in a well-known secret letter in 1956. In this letter to the American head of state, Rockefeller said:
    “Our policy must be both ‘global’ and ‘total’; ‘global’ meaning to include every part of the world, and ‘total’ meaning to include political, psychological, economic, military, and special methods, combining these methods into a whole. In other words, to harness all our horses to the same cart.”
    The "global" goal of the Rockefeller Consortium is to place the whole world under the rule of their dynasty. Obviously, the issue is not about people, but about capital, not about individual families, but about powerful financial groups.

    II
    John Rockefeller I, the founder of the Standard Oil monopoly, had an income of nearly $10 million in 1890. According to the notes of Frederick Gates, the oil tycoon's financial advisor, he said to his boss that year: "Your wealth is swelling, swelling like a roaring tide! You should not fall behind it! You should distribute it (referring to reinvestment of capital - author's note) at an even faster pace than it grows! If you don't, it will crush you and your descendants!"
    In 1901, Rockefeller's personal wealth reached $200 million. In 1904, James Keene, the largest stockbroker in the United States, said: "How can one fight against the Standard Oil Consortium, which earns $60 million a year? It controls all industrial sectors and occupies all railways and urban transportation lines. In a few years, it will control the entire country. I see no way to stop it. It is pointless to fight it."
    In 1913, Rockefeller's wealth reached $900 million. In 1917, Byron, the publisher of the American financial newspaper "The Wall Street Journal," said in a letter to the Californian banker Peeren: "I have told Mr. McAdoo (Secretary of the Treasury under President Wilson) that Mr. Rockefeller has an income of one hundred million dollars, but less than one million dollars of it is used up, and the remaining ninety-nine million dollars is invested in industry..."
    This was the situation forty years ago. By the time of the First World War, Rockefeller's tens of millions of dollars had already increased to over a billion dollars. According to the same law of profit increase of monopoly capital, this billion dollars is now multiplying into tens of billions of dollars at an even faster rate. Just as in the past, capital commands its financial oligarchs: turn the excess profits into new investments at a faster rate than you extract profits. Otherwise, the huge waves of gold will overwhelm you.
    This is how the Rockefeller Consortium has been developing.
    On the eve of the First World War, this consortium was not only an oil giant but also the largest banker. It widely controlled railway and copper-lead mining companies. It also participated in steel trusts, nickel trusts, many coal mining concerns, and insurance companies. It was also a major shareholder in dozens of other of the largest American enterprises. The Rockefeller Consortium was thus firmly placed in the ranks of the main and most ruthless exploiters of the American working class, waging constant struggles with them. But this was just the beginning.
    In 1914-1918, the net profit of the Rockefeller Consortium nearly reached half a billion dollars. After the First World War, it found new outlets for its "rushing profits." This was the export of capital. While continuing to expand its investment scope in the American economy, Standard Oil also launched a widespread offensive abroad. It began to seize oil leases abroad, first in Latin America and the Middle East. At the same time, the Rockefeller Consortium also established its oil sales network around the world. It spent billions of dollars in exploring new oil fields, buying off politicians and governments, and conducting behind-the-scenes diplomatic struggles. Step by step, the Rockefeller Consortium squeezed out its British rivals, and accumulated tens of billions of new dollars at the expense of the British Empire.
    After the First World War, Britain controlled three-quarters of the world's oil reserves. At that time, Standard Oil hardly occupied any oil resources outside the United States. However, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Rockefeller Consortium, together with other American oil tycoons acting in concert with it, had controlled a quarter of the capitalist world's oil production. Now, their interests not only directly conflict with the interests of the American working class and British imperialism, but also with the national interests of the people of Arab, Latin American and other countries. The Rockefeller machine used to accumulate tens of billions of dollars has changed from an American machine into an international machine.
    Moreover, the center of gravity of the dynasty's interests has shifted to American foreign policy. If we carefully observe the development and actions of the American billionaire's financial empire, the State Department's policies in recent decades will become very clear.

    III
    The Second World War greatly increased the military's need for fuel, and the widespread use of oil in the production of military chemical products brought the Rockefeller Consortium more than two billion dollars in profits. If it took the Rockefeller dynasty about fifty years to get its first billion dollars, it only took about five years to get these later two billion dollars. From this time on, the third stage of expansion began.
    Oil, as before, remains the foundation of the Rockefeller Consortium's wealth and strength. By 1956, the Rockefeller Consortium and their partners controlled two-fifths of the capitalist world's oil production. In Venezuela, their share grew to 67.8%, and in the Middle East to 55.8%. The Rockefeller dynasty has become the pillar of modern American colonialism. In the seventeen years since the beginning of the Second World War, the profits of American oil companies' foreign investments have increased elevenfold. By 1956, these companies' foreign investments accounted for more than three-fifths of all American capital exports. Now, the excess profits flowing into the Rockefeller dynasty are coming from foreign oil, not from American oil. The main company of the Rockefeller Consortium, Standard Oil of New Jersey, extracts three-quarters of its total profits from abroad. Another Rockefeller Consortium oil company, Aramco, which operates in Saudi Arabia, had a profit of $580 million in 1955, exceeding the Rockefeller Consortium's profit during the entire First World War.
    How to handle these huge torrents of dollars like Niagara Falls?
    Monopolists across the ocean know better than others that American industry will sooner or later face the terrible threat of a sales crisis after the war. In order to protect themselves from possible bankruptcy, monopolists began to pay more attention to those industrial sectors whose sales are guaranteed by the bourgeois state - the sectors that produce instruments of death, and dig for profit potential. The arms industry has become the second major pillar of the Rockefeller Consortium besides oil.
    The Cold War can be considered to have begun in 1946, when the Rockefeller Consortium and other American oligarchs bet on the production of weapons of mass destruction, hoping to get rich by leaps and bounds in military technology.
    Even during the war, the real leadership of the American secret nuclear energy industry, from the very beginning, was controlled by Rockefeller in conjunction with the Morgan, DuPont and other monopoly capital families. Many prominent nuclear energy experts and organizers who publicly spoke on behalf of the government were actually plenipotentiary representatives hired by the oil dynasty.
    James Conant, former chairman of the U.S. National Defense Research Committee, who in 1941 was a member of the top six-person group for nuclear energy personally led by Roosevelt, was the director of the Rockefeller Institute. Murphree, chairman of the "Planning Committee" for the manufacture of the atomic bomb, who was later appointed as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense responsible for missiles, was the manager of the Standard Oil Development Company. Bernal, an advisor on nuclear energy issues at the State Department, is the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. McClore, a staff member of the State Department responsible for atomic issues, later became the chairman of the Rockefeller Bank "Chase Manhattan Bank." Lewis Strauss, who until recently served as the chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, is now a financial advisor to Rockefeller Brothers Company. Bowyer, the former secretary-general of the Atomic Energy Commission, is now the manager of Standard Oil of New Jersey. Leberon, the former chairman of the Military Liaison Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, was formerly an employee of Standard Oil of California.
    Many other leading figures in American nuclear energy with this background can be cited. The American "Collier's" magazine once wrote, "Without Rockefeller's help, the United States would not have an atomic bomb during the Second World War, or even now." In this huge business of nuclear armament, all the major dynasties of the American monopoly groups participated, but the Rockefeller Consortium occupied the first chair for itself from day one.
    The Rockefeller Dynasty participates directly or indirectly in the aviation industry, the electronics industry, and the military-chemical industry, participates in the supply of metals and machines for the production of military arms, and participates in the manufacture of new rockets. Laurence Rockefeller participates in the board of directors of the military-chemical industry "Olin Mathieson Chemical Concern", Vitro Corporation of America involved in uranium, the latter of which is involved in the manufacture of atomic bombs; he also participates in the affairs of the aviation industry monopoly, Glenn L. Martin Company, which manufactures "Vanguard", "Titan", "Matador" and "Marauder" missiles; he also participates in the affairs of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. McClore, the financial agent of the Rockefeller Consortium, participates in the board of directors of the nuclear power industry monopoly, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and the military-chemical trust, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation. There is no need to copy down this list anymore, because materials about the Rockefeller Consortium's arms business can now be written into an entire book.
    The results of the third expansion stage of this dynasty of American financial oligarchs are clearly visible even to the most inexperienced observer. The Rockefeller Consortium's billions of capital are now primarily working to manufacture death, working for death on a "global" scale and in a "total" form. This is essentially the content of the recently rampant "Rockefellerism." In the words of economists, this death-ism is the key to opening the investment market and is a method of obtaining super profits on an unprecedented scale. (To be continued)

    洛克菲勒王朝的政策
    苏联  阿·列昂尼道夫
    一
    正如二十世纪的现实生活所表明，资本主义衰落时代的特征是主要的资产阶级国家变成一种独特的亿万富翁帝国。无论共和国和君主国都遭遇了同等的命运。新的管理形式的建立，既没有征询人民的意见，也没有经过国会的批准。金融帝国的产生，是由资本主义经济规律本身决定的。资本的集中，产生了产业垄断资本和以超级资本家的亿万富翁为首的金融寡头。这些超级资本家控制着大部分国民财富：天然资源、生产资料和货币资本。由于这种控制，他们手里所掌握的权力不比旧时代的封建君主小，而是更大。
    资产阶级民主日益明显地成为虚构的东西。实际上发号施令的不是部长和总统，而是金融帝国的帝王们。最有势力的资产阶级国会议员、行政官和军事首长，都转而附属于他们。新的执政者的政策，不论对内对外，就其实质说来都是为了一个目的：攫取空前巨大的利润。数以亿计的资本以飞快的速度产生数以亿计的利润。未来的历史学家们将怀着惊奇的心情记述着，资本主义在它生存的末期产生了多么幻奇的社会生活方式。但是，同代人都有机会证实，正是这些无冕帝王的亿万富翁们的利益，首先决定着当代资产阶级世界的日常政策。
    在这个世界上当权的所有亿万富翁的王朝中，最强大的是洛克菲勒王朝。目前，它所控制的公司股份的价值为六百亿美元。这个数目比法国的国民收入还要多50％。再没有任何一个金融寡头的家族拥有这末多的财富，以及对西方政府领导人起这末大的影响。无数事实说明，现今的美国政策往往是洛克菲勒王朝利益的集中表现。这个王朝的成员之一、过去担任艾森豪威尔总统助理的纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，在1956年他的一封尽人皆知的秘信里亲自证实了这一点。洛克菲勒在给美国元首的这封信中说：
    “我们的政策必须既是‘全球的’又是‘总体的’；所谓‘全球的’是指要包括全世界每一个部分，所谓‘总体的’是指要包括政治、心理、经济、军事和特别的方法，而把这些方法结合为一个整体。换句话说，要把我们所有的马匹都拴成一队。”
    洛克菲勒财团的“全球的”目标，就是要把全世界置于他们的王朝统治之下。很显然，问题不在于人，而在于资本，不在于个别的家族，而在于强大的金融集团。
    二
    石油垄断组织美孚石油公司的创始人约翰·洛克菲勒第一，在1890年那年的收入近一千万美元。根据这位石油大王的财政顾问弗烈德里克·盖茨的笔记，当年他曾向他的老板说：“您的财产在膨胀，像汹涌的潮水一样在膨胀！您不应当落在它的后面！您应当用比它增长的速度还要快的速度来分配它（指实行资本的再投资——作者注）！如果您不这样做，它就会压垮您和您的子孙！”
    1901年洛克菲勒的私人财产达到两亿美元。 1904年美国最大的股票交易经纪人詹姆士·金说道：“怎样才能敌得过每年收入达六千万美元的美孚油财团？它控制了所有工业部门，占有全部铁路和城市交通线。再过几年，它将控制整个国家。我看不出有什么方法能制止住它。同它抗争是没有意思的。”
    1913年洛克菲勒的财产达到九亿美元。1917年美国金融界的报纸“华尔街日报”的发行人拜龙，在给加利福尼亚的银行家彼伦的信中说道：“我曾告诉麦卡德先生（威尔逊总统属下的财政部长）说，洛克菲勒先生拥有一亿美元的收入，但是其中用掉的还不到一百万美元，其余的九千九百万美元都投到工业中去了……”
    这是四十年前的情况。到第一次世界大战时，洛克菲勒的几千万美元已经增殖了上十亿美元。按照垄断资本利润增殖的同一规律，现在这十亿美元要以更快的速度再增殖几十亿美元。正像以往一样，资本向它的金融寡头们命令说：用比榨取利润还要快的速度把超额利润变成新的投资吧。不然黄金的巨浪会把你们冲垮。
    洛克菲勒财团就是这样在发展着。
    在第一次世界大战前夕，这个财团已经不仅是石油巨头而且也是最大的银行家，它广泛地控制了铁路及开采铜铅的公司。它还参加了钢铁托辣斯、制镍托辣斯、许多采煤康采恩和保险公司。它又是美国其他几十家最大企业的主要股东。洛克菲勒财团就这样牢牢地置身于美国工人阶级的主要的和最残酷的剥削者行列，同他们进行着不断的斗争。但这还只是开始。
    在1914—1918年，洛克菲勒财团的净利几乎达到五亿美元。第一次世界大战以后，它为自己的“汹涌而来的利润”找到了新的出路。这就是输出资本。美孚油财团在继续扩大它在美国经济中的投资范围的同时，也向国外广泛展开进攻。它开始在国外攫夺石油租借地，首先是在拉丁美洲和中东。同时洛克菲勒财团也在世界各处建立它的石油销售网。在勘探新的油田、收买政客和政府、进行幕后外交斗争方面，花费了亿万美元。洛克菲勒财团一步一步地排挤它的英国对手，以牺牲大英帝国的办法又积累了几十亿新的美元。
    第一次世界大战以后，英国手中掌握了世界石油蕴藏量的四分之三。当时，美孚油财团在美国国外几乎没有占到石油资源。但是，到第二次世界大战开始时，洛克菲勒财团和同它一致行动的其他美国石油大王们一道，已经控制了资本主义世界石油开采量的四分之一。现在，他们的利益不仅同美国工人阶级的利益、英国帝国主义的利益发生直接冲突，而且也同阿拉伯、拉丁美洲以及其他国家人民的民族利益发生直接冲突。用作积累亿万美元的洛克菲勒机器，已经从美国的机器变成一个国际性的机器了。
    而且，这个王朝利益的重心已经转到美国外交政策里。如果仔细观察一下美国亿万富翁的金融帝国的发展和行动，那末，最近几十年来国务院的方针就十分清楚了。
    三
    第二次世界大战使军队对燃料的需要大大增加，使军事化学产品的生产广泛利用起石油，这就给洛克菲勒财团带来了二十亿美元以上的利润。如果说洛克菲勒王朝弄到第一个十亿美元用了约五十年的时间，那末，这后来得到的二十亿美元仅仅费了约五年的时间。从这个时候起，开始了第三个扩张阶段。
    石油同以前一样仍然是洛克菲勒财团财富和实力的基础。到1956年，洛克菲勒财团和他们的合伙人控制了资本主义世界石油开采量的五分之二。在委内瑞拉，他们的份额增长到67.8％，在中东增长到55.8％。洛克菲勒王朝成了现代美国殖民主义者的台柱。在第二次世界大战开始以后的十七年间，美国石油公司在国外投资的利润增加了十一倍，到1956年，这些公司的国外投资占美国全部资本输出的五分之三强。现在，流入洛克菲勒王朝的超额利润已经是来自国外石油的，而不是来自美国石油的了。洛克菲勒财团的主要公司新泽西美孚油公司从国外榨取的利润占它全部利润的四分之三。洛克菲勒财团的另一个石油公司，在沙特阿拉伯经营的阿美石油公司1955年的利润达五亿八千万美元，超过洛克菲勒财团在整个第一次世界大战时期的利润。
    怎样处理这些像尼亚加拉瀑布般的美元巨流呢？
    大洋彼岸的垄断资本家比别人知道得更清楚，美国工业战后迟早会遇到销路危机的可怕威胁。为了保障自己免于可能的破产，垄断资本家开始更注意在由资产阶级国家保证其销路的那些工业部门——生产死亡工具的部门，挖掘利润的潜力。军火工业成为洛克菲勒财团除石油以外的第二个主要支柱。
    冷战可以认为是在1946年开始的，当时，洛克菲勒财团和美国其他寡头曾把赌注放在生产大规模毁灭性武器上，希图借着军事技术的飞跃进步发财致富。
    还在战争进行期间，美国秘密建立的原子能工业的真正领导权，从一开始就被洛克菲勒会同摩根、杜邦和其他垄断资本家族所掌握。许多代表政府公开发言的著名原子能专家和组织者，实际上就是石油王朝雇用的全权代表。
    前美国国防研究委员会主席詹姆士·康南特，1941年曾是罗斯福亲自领导的原子能最高六人小组的成员之一，他便是洛克菲勒研究所的所长。制造原子弹的“计划委员会”主席梅富里，后来曾被任命为国防部长负责导弹的特别助理，曾是美孚石油开发公司的经理。国务院原子能问题顾问贝尔纳，是洛克菲勒基金会主席。国务院负责原子问题的工作人员麦克洛埃，后来成了洛克菲勒银行“曼哈顿大通银行”董事长。路易斯·斯特劳斯不久以前曾任美国原子能委员会主席，现在是洛克菲勒兄弟公司的财政顾问。原子能委员会前任秘书长鲍耶尔，现在是新泽西美孚油公司的经理。原子能委员会所属军事联络委员会前任主席列贝隆，曾任加利福尼亚美孚油公司的职员。
    还可以举出许多美国原子能方面有这种来历的首脑人物。美国“柯里尔”杂志曾写道，“没有洛克菲勒的帮助，在第二次世界大战期间或者说甚至现在，美国都不会有原子弹。”在原子武装这笔巨大的生意中，美国垄断集团的所有主要王朝都参加了，但是洛克菲勒财团从第一天起就为自己占下了第一把交椅。
    洛克菲勒王朝直接或间接地参加航空工业、电子工业和军事化学工业，参加供应生产军火的金属和机器，参加制造新火箭的事务。劳伦斯·洛克菲勒参加军事化学工业“奥林·麦奇逊化学康采恩”、维特罗制铀康采恩的董事会，后者是参加制造原子弹的；他也参预航空工业垄断组织格林·马丁公司的事务，这是制造“先锋”、“大力神”、“斗牛士”和“海盗”式导弹的；他还参预麦克唐纳飞机公司的事务。洛克菲勒财团的财政代理人麦克洛埃，参加原子电力工业垄断组织威斯汀豪斯电气公司和军事化学托辣斯艾兰德化学染料公司的董事会。这个名单用不着再抄下去了，因为关于洛克菲勒财团的军火生意的材料，现在可以写成整整一本书。
    美国财政寡头的这个王朝的第三扩张阶段的结果，连最没有经验的观察家都可以清楚地看出来。洛克菲勒财团的亿万资本，现在首先是为制造死亡而工作，为“全球”规模和“总体”形式的死亡而工作。近来甚嚣尘上的“洛克菲勒主义”的内容，实质上就是如此。用经济学家的话来说，这个死亡主义是打开投资市场的锁钥，是以空前规模获取超额利润的方法。　（未完）
