Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Premier Zhou Enlai, when receiving two Brazilian peace representatives this evening, extended greetings to the people of Latin America who are engaged in the struggle against colonialism and wished them new victories in their struggle.

Premier Zhou Enlai said to the two peace representatives: Murilo Marroquim, representative of the Brazilian United Press, and Miss Dutra, a journalist from the Brazilian People's Daily, that the people of Latin American countries, like the people of Asian and African countries, have commonalities and common goals. These are to oppose colonialism, to oppose imperialist aggression and interference; to demand peace, to oppose war; and to demand the independent development of the national economy, and to get rid of backwardness. Premier Zhou Enlai said that, in other words, the people of Latin America, Asia, and Africa have common aspirations and common demands. These demands were reflected in the Bandung Conference held in 1955. Latin American countries did not send representatives to participate in that conference, but the spirit of the Bandung Conference is influencing Latin America. Premier Zhou Enlai also mentioned the upsurge in the Latin American people's movement for peace, against colonialism, and for economic independence in the past year. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Latin American people have stood at the forefront of the opposition to colonialism and imperialism. If we say that the people of Arab countries stand at the forefront of the opposition to Western colonialism, then we should say that the people of Latin American countries stand at the forefront of the opposition to American imperialism. This should be said to be a feature of the new world situation and is worthy of our praise.

During the meeting with them, those present included Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Zhou Erfu, Executive Director of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, who will soon lead the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe on a visit to Latin American countries.

　　周总理接见巴西和平代表谈世界新形势
　　拉丁美洲站在反美最前线
    新华社16日讯　周恩来总理在今天晚间接见巴西的两位和平代表的时候，向正在进行反对殖民主义斗争的拉丁美洲人民致意，并祝他们在斗争中取得新的胜利。
    周恩来总理向这两位和平代表：巴西联合报业代表穆列洛·马罗金、巴西大众日报女记者杜特列说，拉丁美洲各国人民和亚洲、非洲各国人民一样，大家有着共同性，有着共同的目标，这就是反对殖民主义，反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉；要求和平，反对战争；要求民族经济的独立发展，摆脱落后状况。周恩来总理说，换句话说，拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲各国人民有着共同的愿望，共同的要求。这种要求反映在1955年召开的万隆会议上，拉丁美洲各国没有派代表参加那次会议，但是万隆会议精神正在拉丁美洲发生着影响。周恩来总理还说到最近一年来拉丁美洲人民要求和平、反对殖民主义和要求经济独立运动的高涨。周恩来总理说，拉丁美洲人民已经站在反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义的最前线。如果说阿拉伯各国人民站在反对西方殖民主义的最前线，那末我们应该说拉丁美洲各国人民就是站在反对美帝国主义的最前线。这应该说是世界新形势的一个特点，值得我们称赞。
    周恩来总理在接见他们时，在座的有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志、对外文化联络委员会副主任张致祥和即将率领中国杂技艺术团前往拉丁美洲各国访问的中国人民对外文化协会常务理事周而复等。
