Visiting a Commune in Fengqiao
　　Ke Ling
　　On the second day of my visit to Fengqiao, I visited the Shibai Township Communist Construction Commune. It was the first time I realized what kind of miracles the awakened land of our motherland could create.

　　Fengqiao is a town under the jurisdiction of Zhuji County, traditionally famous for producing fragrant torreya nuts, but this time it has become the focus of attention because of the bumper harvest of early rice.

　　Due to work constraints, we could only arrange one day for the visit. But one day was enough, this one day was worth decades!

　　Shaoxing, Zhuji's neighbor, is a region with abundant water, and you can see mirror-like rivers everywhere. The day before, when we passed by Shaoxing, a very pleasing sight was the white windmills standing in the middle of the green fields, quietly turning in the gentle breeze. Shaoxing is my hometown, and I know that the local farmers have always used their feet to tread water; the rotation of the windmills is precisely a sign of the era's leap forward. But after entering Zhuji, the river ports and waterwheels disappeared, and all we saw along the way were continuous mountain ranges coming towards us. This geographical feature shows that the conditions for planting rice in this area are very unfavorable.

　　Shibai Township is a mountain township, surrounded by mountains on three sides and leaning against Bi Lake on one side. The terrain near the mountains is high, and the terrain near the water is low, descending in layers, and most of the fields are in the hilly areas and mountain bends. This environment is simply torture to the farmers: drought in the high places and floods in the low places! - The drought is particularly severe. A few days of sunshine can cause the land to crack. Before liberation, the farmers called their beloved fields "paijiu fields," because the result of hard work was often a hopeless gamble. The fate of selling children and starving to death by hanging was always lurking around them. But social conditions have changed, and the men, women, and children of Shibai Township have finally changed their fate with their own hands, and at the same time changed the face of their homeland. In this summer, the harvest of early rice in this mountain township has reached an average of 1,160 jin per mu, of which more than 50 mu have a yield of more than 2,000 jin. This large-scale high yield has particularly attracted everyone's attention.

　　Fengqiao is 30 li away from Shibai Township. We drove in jeeps through the fields, sometimes climbing over hills, sometimes passing through dry riverbeds, and sometimes passing through some small villages with beautiful scenery. Looking at the surrounding mountain peaks, I saw that many hillsides had been opened up into neat fields; at the same time, I heard that the road we were driving on was also built by the local farmers themselves. My heart was filled with excitement, as if I had personally experienced a fierce war—a life-and-death battle between man and nature, and people finally won.

　　Anyone can see that the entire field is now smiling. Red flags on the paths flutter in the wind, colorful arches stand at the entrances of the villages, children beat gongs and drums by the roadside, and the sound of firecrackers can be heard from afar, followed by clusters of misty white smoke exploding in the blue sky. Every village is drying grain, and all the open spaces and both sides of the road are covered with golden grains; when we pass by, we have to stop everywhere and help the farmers turn up the bamboo mats used for drying grain before we can barely pass. The joy of the harvest is truly intoxicating!

　　In order to save time, harvesting and planting are going on at the same time. At three o'clock in the morning, before dawn, the farmers are already working in the fields; late at night, in a chorus of frogs, you can still see lights all over the fields. In this sultry summer, their average sleep time per day is two or three hours. But even in such a tense moment, the farmer comrades still received us warmly. They modestly regarded the visit from afar as an encouragement.

　　The office of the commune is clean and spacious, with walls full of dazzling reports of good news, letters of determination, challenge letters, and messages from visitors from other places written in large red paper. - This is not ordinary text, but the expression of the farmers' infinitely strong will. Not far from the commune, the words "Strive for 1,500 Jin per Mu" were written in large characters on a pink wall! This was the goal of struggle during the spring ploughing. At that time, some people felt it was "reckless," but now, only three months later, people think of their own conservative ideas as soon as they see it, because the yield of one season has already exceeded the annual target. During the spring ploughing, the experimental fields were all done by cadres, but now the masses have also risen to do it; in the past, they did one or two mu, but now they do 6,000 mu at a time, with targets of 20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu, and the highest is set at 50,000 jin. (The general target for late rice is 13,000 jin.) They also put forward a resounding slogan to strive for "plant one mu, harvest one mu, and make every mu a bumper harvest!" In an experimental field in a certain county in Zhejiang, there was such a bold statement: "Heroes have lofty ambitions, and they want to break through the 20,000 jin barrier for rice!" Now that the situation has changed, Shibai Township has quietly surpassed them.

　　The decisive key to Fengqiao District's ability to conquer nature and triumph in production lies in the large-scale water conservancy projects. In two years, more than 5,000 reservoirs have been built in the entire district, and more than 100 in Shibai Township alone. - Among them are youth reservoirs, elderly reservoirs, women's reservoirs, and night reservoirs built using rest time every night. In this way, the farmers, with one heart and one mind, used shovels and spades to add many lakes between thousands of mountains and valleys, nourishing the vast and beautiful fields.

　　We visited the Longxi Reservoir in Shibai Township. This is one of the largest reservoirs in Fengqiao District. Standing on the tall flood control dam, we could see the large terraced fields surrounded by peaks, spreading from our feet straight into the distance, like a sloping hillside. The sun was shining brightly, and there was not a trace of cloud in the sky, but the early rice that had not yet been harvested and the newly transplanted rice seedlings in the fields were golden and green, shining brightly. It is said that there has been no rain for two months, but the reservoir is still a clear pool, which can continuously quench the thirst of the earth. Without it, the drought demon would have knocked on the door long ago, so how could we talk about a bumper harvest!

　　The location of Longxi Reservoir is called Bao Village, which belongs to a large team of Shibai Commune. This small mountain village once had a heroic history. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, the great tyrant Bao Lisheng entrenched himself in the village, gathering the landlords from the surrounding areas, with strong soldiers and sufficient grain, and confronting the Taiping Army. The Taiping Army camped ten li in this area, attacked for three years, and killed 100,000 soldiers. They made the determination that "we would rather abandon Jinling than abandon Bao Village," and finally defeated this group of landlord tyrants. The common people compiled a few vivid folk songs for the landlords, which are still circulating among the population today, saying: "Wearing silk, eating oil, come to Bao Village to be beheaded!" It is this mountain village with revolutionary traditions that now not only has reservoirs and hydropower stations, but also built a thermal power station, and issued the slogan of electrification.

　　We had lunch in Bao Village, eating newly harvested early rice with awns, white and glutinous, with the charm of jade and pearls. We truly tasted the fragrance of this "treasure among treasures" grain, with a strong smell of sweat. - This is not only to be chewed with the mouth, but also to be enjoyed with the heart.

　　We also ate sweet Litou melons. We will never forget this scene: enthusiastic farmers even threw newly picked melons into our speeding car along the way.

　　In the afternoon, we visited the public canteen in another village. There is also running water here, which was cleverly drawn from the mountains far away by the farmers using bamboo pipes. This village has a triangular experimental field, filled with dense and full rice, lying on the ground in a golden color. The masses estimate that the yield of this mu is 7,000 jin, and several agricultural workers are making precise calculations on the spot. There is a pig in this village that weighs more than 600 jin.

　　It has only been a month since Shibai Township originally had four agricultural production cooperatives, merged and reorganized, and established the Communist Construction Commune. These cooperatives were originally advanced cooperatives, and public opinion recognized that they "have good political leadership, good production, good cultural learning, and good cleanliness and hygiene." After the lesson of such a vivid fact of a bumper harvest, the political enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly improved, the enthusiasm is greater, the confidence is more sufficient, and the vision is farther. Many people say,
　　"Thousand-jin fields, thousand-jin fields, have been called for many years! It is said that, but I always didn't believe it in my heart. Who knew that the harvest in one season is now a thousand jin per mu. This is news that has never been heard in thousands of generations, and it can only be done under the leadership of the Communist Party!" People now clearly see the power of the Party, their own power, and also see how magical contributions the great and gentle Earth Mother will make to mankind under the cultivation of awakened people! Comrade Yang Yaokun, the head of the commune (he is a national agricultural bumper harvest labor model, a short and simple farmer), told us: After the autumn harvest this year, a large team will do typical experiments to implement the production delivery system and the ration system - that is to say, to implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The scattered households in the commune will be concentrated, and new farmhouses are already being prepared for construction.

　　Here, we not only saw the glorious victory of the general line, but also saw the dawn of communism rising slowly behind the ridge.

　　In the evening, the sound of gongs and drums and firecrackers in Fengqiao Town continued. The Zhejiang Provincial Folk Song and Dance Troupe's consolation performance was in progress, and the square that could accommodate 10,000 spectators was crowded with farmers, men and women, from various townships. They watched the play with great enthusiasm, and some had to go to the fields to work after watching it. In the audience near the stage, I saw two old farmers sitting on the ground, looking up, grinning, their wrinkled faces having experienced so much wind and frost, but at this moment they were all focused, watching the stage with relish. I observed them for a long time, imagining how deep the excitement and how great the joy were churning in their hearts. When I was a child, under the starry sky of the countryside in summer evenings, I don't know how many times I watched village operas and came into contact with so many such faces, but the situation was so different! In the past, what was performed on the stage was nothing more than the rise and fall of loyal ministers and good generals, and the joys and sorrows of talented scholars and beautiful women; what was watched on the stage was nothing more than borrowing other people's wine to quench one's own sorrow. But now, every song and dance on the stage expresses the heroic spirit and soaring enthusiasm of the spectators under the stage.

　　Only today have the farmers truly become the masters of their lives!

　　访枫桥的一个公社
　　柯灵
    到枫桥的第二天，我们访问了视北乡共产主义建设公社。我第一次认识到，祖国觉醒了的大地，会创造出什么样的奇迹来。
    枫桥是诸暨县所属的一个镇，向来以出产香榧子著名，这一次却因为早稻丰收，成为万众注目的所在。
    因为工作的牵掣，我们只能安排一天的参观时间。可是一天也尽够了，这一天抵得上几十年！
    诸暨的近邻绍兴，是一个多水的地区，到处看得见明镜般的河流。前一天，我们路过绍兴的时候，一种非常悦目的景象，是碧绿的田畴中间，矗立着一座座洁白的风车，在熏风里静幽幽转动。绍兴是我的故乡，我知道，当地的农民从来都用双脚车水；风车的旋转，正是时代跃进的一个征象。但进入诸暨境内以后，河港和水车都消失了，沿路只见连绵不断的山岭扑面而来。这种地理特点说明，这个区域对种植水稻的条件，是非常不利的。
    视北乡正是一个山乡，三面环山，一面靠在泌湖。近山地势高，濒水地势低，层层下降，绝大部分的田亩都在丘陵地带、山弯里面，这种环境，简直是大自然对农民的折磨：高处苦旱，低处苦涝！——特别严重的是旱灾，几天大太阳，就可以使连阡的土地龟裂。解放以前，农民把自己心爱的田园叫做“牌九田”，因为胼手?足的结果，往往是一场无望的赌博。卖儿鬻女，饿死上吊的命运随时都在窥伺着他们。可是社会条件改变了，视北乡的男女老少，终于用双手改变了自己的命运，同时改变了乡土的面貌。就在这个夏天，这个山乡里面，早稻的收获量已经达到每亩平均一千一百六十斤，其中有五十多亩的产量是二千多斤，这种大面积的丰产，特别引起大家的注意。
    从枫桥到视北乡，相距三十华里。我们坐着吉普车在田间走着，有时爬过山丘，有时穿过干涸的河床，有时经过一些景色清丽的小村。我望着周围屏列的山峰，看到很多山坡上都开辟了整齐的田亩；同时听说我们正在行车的这条公路，也是当地的农民自己筑成的，我心里充塞着激动的情绪，仿佛亲身经历了一场剧烈的战争——人和自然之间出生入死的肉搏战，而人们终于取得了胜利。
    谁都可以看出来，现在整个的田野都在笑了。陌上的红旗迎风招展，村口的牌楼彩色缤纷，孩子们在路边敲锣打鼓，远处还不时响起炮竹的声音，接着就有一朵朵氤氲的白烟，在蓝色的晴空中爆开。每个村子里都在晒谷，所有的空场和大路两边，遍地铺满黄金似的谷粒；我们经过的时候，不得不到处停车，帮着农民们把晒谷的竹簟翻起以后，才能勉强通过。丰收的喜悦，真是熏人欲醉！
    为了争取时间，抢收和抢种正在同时进行。清早三点，天色未明，农民已经在田里劳作；到了深夜，在一片蛙鼓声中，还可以看见遍野的灯火。在这困人的盛夏，他们每天平均的睡眠时间是两三小时。但在这样紧张的时刻，农民同志们还是殷勤地接待了我们。他们谦逊地把远道而来的观光看作是一种鼓舞。
    公社的办公室整洁而宽敞，满壁琳琅，都是大红纸写成的喜报、决心书、挑战书、加上外地参观访问者的赠言。——这不是普通的文字，而是农民们无限坚强的意志力的表现。在社外不远，一座粉墙上写着擘窠大字：“为亩产一千五百斤而斗争”！这是春耕时候的奋斗目标，当时还有人觉得“冒”，现在为时不过三个月，人们一看见它，却就想起了自己的保守思想，因为一季的产量有的已经超越了全年的指标。春耕时搞试验田的都是干部，现在群众也纷纷起来搞了；从前是一亩二亩的搞，现在一搞就是六千亩，指标亩产两三万斤，最高有订到五万斤的。（一般的晚稻指标是一万三千斤。）他们还提出了响亮的口号，要争取“搞一亩，打一亩，亩亩都丰收！”浙江某县的试验地里，曾有过这样的豪语：“英雄抱有凌云志，要破水稻二万关！”如今行情一变，视北乡不声不响地超过了他们。
    枫桥区能够在生产上人定胜天，高奏凯歌，决定性的关键在于大兴水利。全区的水库，二年中搞了五千多个，单是视北一乡，就有一百多。——其中有青年水库，老年水库，妇女水库，还有利用每天晚上休息时间搞出来的夜水库。农民们就这样，万众一心，运用一锹一铲，使千山万谷之间，平添出许多湖泊，滋润着广阔的锦绣田原。
    我们参观了视北乡的龙溪水库。这是枫桥区有数的大水库之一，站在高大的拦洪坝上，看得出峰峦环抱中的大片梯田，由脚下直向远处展开去，像下泄的山坡。烈日当头，天上没有一丝云影，而田头未收的早稻和刚插的秧苗，金黄碧绿，照眼生光。听说当地已经整两个月没有下雨，而水库里依然是一泓澄碧，可以不断供大地解渴。要是没有它，旱魃早就来叩门了，还谈得上什么丰收！
    龙溪水库的所在地叫做包村，属于视北公社的一个大队。这个小小的山村，曾经有一段壮烈的历史。在太平天国的年代，大恶霸包立生就盘踞在村里，把四近的地主都集中起来，兵精粮足，和太平军对抗。太平军在这一带扎营十里，攻打三年，死士十万，下了“宁可弃金陵，不可弃包村”的决心，最后才把这一批地主恶霸打垮了。老百姓替地主们编了几句生动的民谣，至今还流传人口，道是：“穿的绸，吃的油，赶到包村来杀头！”就是这个有革命传统的山村，现在不但有了水库、水力发电站，还建起了火力发电站，发出了电气化的口号。
    我们在包村吃了午饭，吃的是新割的有芒早梗，白而且糯，看起来有玉润珠圆的韵味。这一顿真正尝到了这“宝中之宝”的粮食的香味，其中有强烈的汗香。——这不仅是要用口来咀嚼，而且应该用心来消受的。
    我们还吃了鲜甜的黎头瓜。我们永远不会忘记这种情景：热情的农民甚至把新摘的甜瓜沿路抛进我们飞驰着的车子。
    下午参观的是另一个村子的公共食堂。这里也有自来水，是聪明的农民用竹管子从山上遥远地引过来的。这个村子有一块三角形的试验田，弥望是繁密饱满的稻子，黄澄澄的躺了一地，群众估计这一亩的产量是七千斤，有几位农业工作人员正在现场作精密的核算。这个村子里有一口猪的重量是六百多斤。
    视北乡原来有四个农业生产合作社，合并改组，建立起共产主义建设公社，还不过是一个来月的事情。这些合作社原来也就是先进社，舆论公认他们“政治挂帅好，生产好，学习文化好，清洁卫生好”。经过大丰收这样活鲜鲜的事实的教训，群众的政治积极性更大大地提高了，劲头更大，信心更足，眼光放得更远了。很多人说，
  “千斤田，千斤田，叫了多少年！说是这么说，心里总是不信。谁知现在一季的收成，就是亩亩千斤。这是千年万代没有的新闻，只有共产党领导才办得到！”人们现在清清楚楚地看到了党的力量，自己的力量，也看到了伟大而温柔的地母，在有了觉悟的人们的耕耘之下，会向人类作出多么神奇的贡献！公社社长杨耀坤同志（他是全国农业丰产劳动模范，一个身材短小，神态质朴的农民）告诉我们：今年秋收以后，将由一个大队做典型试验，实行交产制和配售制，——也就是说，实行“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则。社内的零星住户将要集中，新农舍已经在准备建筑。
    在这里，我们不但看见了总路线的光辉的胜利，并且看到了共产主义的曙光，在山梁后冉冉升起。
    晚上，枫桥镇上的锣鼓声和炮竹声依然不断。浙江省民间歌舞团的慰问演出正在进行，能容纳万把观众的广场上，挤满了各乡的农民男女，他们兴高采烈地看着戏，有的看完了还得下田劳作。近台口的观众席上，我看到有两位年老的农民，席地而坐，昂着头，咧着嘴，他们多绉的脸上经历过多少风霜，而此刻却全神贯注，一直津津有味地看着台上。我久久地观察着他们，设想着翻腾在他们心田中的是多深的激动，多大的欢喜。童年的时候，在农村夏晚的星空下，我不知看过多少回社戏，接触过多少这样的面容，可是其间的情景多么不同！从前台上演的，无非是忠臣良将的荣枯升沉，才子佳人的悲欢离合；台下看的，无非是借他人杯酒，浇自己块垒而已。而现在台上的一歌一舞，表现的却都是台下看客的英雄气概，冲天干劲。
    只有今天，农民才真正成了生活的主人！
