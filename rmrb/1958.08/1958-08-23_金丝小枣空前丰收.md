　　Unprecedented Bumper Harvest of Jin Si Small Dates

　　Jin Si Small Dates, known for their large size, thin skin, small pits, delicious taste, high quality, and bright color, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in Cang County, Hebei. According to investigations by commercial departments, this year's small date production is estimated to be between 10.7 million and 15 million jin, an increase of five and a half times compared to last year. Jin Si Small Dates are concentrated in nine townships, including Cuierzhuang, Dusheng, and Gaochuan in Cang County, covering an area of more than 52,600 mu, with more than one million trees. Small dates are an important source of income for local farmers, accounting for 60%-70% of the total income of farmers in some townships. Therefore, sayings such as "Bumper harvest of dates, no worries about food and clothing" and "One year's harvest, enough for three years" are popular among the masses.

　　金丝小枣空前丰收
    河北沧县的个大、皮薄、核小、味美、质高、色泽鲜艳的金丝小枣获得空前丰收，据商业部门的调查估计，今年小枣可产一千零七十万斤到一千五百万斤，比去年增产五倍半。金丝小枣集中分布在沧县崔尔庄、杜生、高川等九个乡，面积达五万二千六百多亩，一百多万株。小枣是当地农民的一项重要收入，有的乡竟占到整个农民收入的60％—70％，因而在群众中流传着“枣树丰收吃穿不愁”、“一年收，三年足”的谚语。
