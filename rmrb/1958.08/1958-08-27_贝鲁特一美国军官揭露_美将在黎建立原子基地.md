　　Beirut—American Officer Reveals
    US to Establish Atomic Base in Lebanon
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 26th: The Beirut "Al Massa" newspaper published on the 25th a leaflet distributed by an American officer invading Lebanon, revealing that the American occupation forces are attempting to establish two atomic bases and five rocket bases in Lebanon, and intend to entrench themselves in Lebanon for a long period.
    This leaflet was secretly distributed among the American officers and soldiers invading Lebanon by John Herr, an officer of the US 79th Engineer Battalion.
    In this leaflet, John Herr wrote that his battalion received orders from superiors to stay in Lebanon for more than fifteen months and to make technical arrangements to transform two airports into atomic bases. The two airports are Rayak Airport (between Beirut and Damascus) and Kleiat Airport (northwest of Halba).
    The leaflet also revealed that the American occupation forces plan to establish five rocket bases in Lebanon, transport large quantities of atomic weapons to Lebanon, and turn Beirut into the main US base in the Middle East.
    John Herr said in the leaflet that he and some other officers were transferred to Lebanon from Munich, West Germany, on July 27th. He said that at that time, he heard that they were coming to Lebanon to "defend Lebanon's sovereignty and independence against military aggression by the United Arab Republic." He also heard that the US troops would only withdraw after the "aggression" against Cairo and Baghdad was repelled.
    This American officer said, "Based on my observations after arriving in Lebanon, the so-called American aggression has nothing to do with the United Arab Republic." He also accused the British and American invasion of Jordan and Lebanon as acts that "threaten world peace" and demanded their withdrawal.
    The Beirut "Al Massa" newspaper said that it now has this leaflet in its office, and anyone who wants to see it can go and see it.

　　贝鲁特一美国军官揭露
    美将在黎建立原子基地
    新华社大马士革26日电贝鲁特“晚报”25日刊登了由一名侵黎美军军官散发的一张传单，这张传单揭露，美国占领军企图在黎巴嫩建立两个原子基地和五个火箭基地，并且打算在黎巴嫩长期盘踞下去。
    这张传单是由美国第七十九工兵营的军官约翰·赫秘密在侵黎美军官兵中散发的。
    约翰·赫在这张传单上写道，他的营接到了上级的命令，要他们在黎巴嫩呆十五个月以上，并且要为把两个飞机场改变成为原子基地作好技术上的安排。这两个机场是拉亚克机场（在贝鲁特和大马士革之间）和克雷阿特机场（在哈勒巴西北部）。
    这张传单还透露，美国占领军计划在黎巴嫩建立五个火箭基地，要把大批原子武器运到黎巴嫩，并且要把贝鲁特变成美国在中东的主要基地。
    约翰·赫在传单中说，他和其他一些军官是7月27日从西德的慕尼黑调到黎巴嫩的。他说，当时听说是来黎巴嫩“保卫黎巴嫩的主权和独立以对付阿拉伯联合共和国的军事侵略”。他说，他还听说，美国军队要到开罗和巴格达的“侵略”被击退后才撤退。
    这位美国军官说，“根据我到了黎巴嫩以后所进行的观察，美国所谓的侵略根本与阿拉伯联合共和国无关”。他还指责英美侵略约旦和黎巴嫩是“威胁世界和平”的行为，并且要求它们撤军。
    贝鲁特“晚报”说，现在在它的办公室内存有这张传单，谁想看都可以去看。
