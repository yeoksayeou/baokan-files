　　A Thousand-Kilometer Peace March from Hiroshima to Tokyo
　　Lan Hai
    In Japan, there are people fighting for peace who are marching along the thousand-kilometer road from Hiroshima to Tokyo. People along the way are continuously joining their ranks in a relay, and gatherings are held everywhere to welcome them. They are like propaganda teams and also like sowing teams. What they are propagating is the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and opposition to nuclear armament. What they are spreading is the seed of peace, the seed of democracy. This is the team from the "Thousand-Kilometer Peace March to Stop Nuclear Armament and Uphold Democracy" from Hiroshima to Tokyo.
    The peace march was initiated by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. The march started on June 20, the first day of the Japanese "National Movement Month to Stop Nuclear Armament and Uphold Democracy," from in front of the Cenotaph for the A-bomb Victims in Hiroshima City, with the destination being the venue of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament in Tokyo.
    When the march started from Hiroshima, there were only a little over one hundred and fifty people. They were small in number, but all of them were people who had been fighting tirelessly for peace. Mr. Toshio Mizoguchi, a peace activist who had lost one leg, also participated in the march in a small car pushed by his wife. He insisted on "walking all the way to Tokyo." Only after patient persuasion from the staff of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs did he give up the idea. On the outskirts of Hiroshima City, he waved goodbye to his peaceful comrades who continued the march.
    When the marching team left Hiroshima City and walked along the road by the Seto Inland Sea coast, only seven people remained. Among them, only one religious figure, Mr. Atsushi Nishimoto, dispatched by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, was scheduled to walk the entire journey. However, this small team, with its advancing steps, attracted more and more people every day. Now, it has developed into a large march of thousands of people. As of July 29, the cumulative number of people who joined the march along the way had reached 400,000. The number of people who joined halfway and volunteered to walk the entire journey also continued to increase. In addition to Atsushi Nishimoto, Reverend Shiun Masumoto, a female Christian minister, Buddhist monks Nitten Fujita, Ryuichi Take, Ms. Tai Honjima, a Tenrikyo believer, representatives of the Kansai Student League, and representatives from various prefectures, among many others, are determined to walk all the way to Tokyo.
    Loving peace and fighting to defend peace are by no means a minority. This was fully demonstrated in the first few days of the march. Those concerned about this peace march are not only the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb councils and peace organizations in various places. The authorities of various cities, towns, and villages cannot help but come out to welcome this peaceful feat. In Seto Town, Hyogo Prefecture, the seventy-four-year-old town mayor walked six kilometers with the marching team. In various places, those who temporarily participate in the march include not only local peace activists and trade union members, but also members of local youth organizations, women's organizations, students, and children. Housewives wearing aprons, clogs, and carrying shopping baskets said, "I will participate for a while whenever I have time," and followed the team in the march. The peace march brought them encouragement and courage, and lit the torch of fighting to defend peace in their hearts.
    On July 6, when the marching team was walking along the highway from Kakogawa to Akashi in Hyogo Prefecture under the scorching sun, more than twenty high school students who had traveled a long distance from Kobe specifically joined their ranks. These students said: When the marching team passes through Kobe City, there are classes at school, so they chose Sunday to run to participate in the march.
    On the evening of the 6th, all evening newspapers reported that the United States continued to test hydrogen bombs on Eniwetok Atoll. This aroused great anger among the people, who believed that it was a provocation against the peaceful actions of the Japanese people. The next day, representatives of the regional council of trade unions and the mayor and chairman of the city council of Akashi City all participated in the march.
    On July 9, the marching team had already walked four hundred kilometers and entered Osaka City. The next morning, a rally was held in Nakanoshima Park in Osaka City, and then a march was held on the city's main street. When the team passed in front of the Osaka General Council building, countless colorful paper strips were thrown from the welcoming crowd; when passing through the Naganara Bridge, more than a dozen peace doves were released from the crowd, soaring in the clear sky, blessing the marchers to advance, advance again!
    On July 19, after the peace march team arrived in Nagoya, they held a "Stop Nuclear Armament and Uphold Democracy" rally with more than 1,500 people from all walks of life in Nagoya. At the meeting, Atsushi Nishimoto condemned the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, believing that this was a threat to world peace. Finally, the conference passed a resolution demanding that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and demanding that the Japanese government announce that it would not arm Japan with nuclear weapons.
    On July 29, the marchers, who had already walked eight hundred kilometers, arrived in Yaizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture. This is the hometown of Aikichi Kuboyama - the first victim of the American hydrogen bomb test. Kuboyama's widow and old mother both participated in the march. The next day, when the marchers left Yaizu City and passed Yaizu Fishing Port, the fishing boat crew pointed out to them the place where the Fifth Fukuryu Maru, which was covered with "dead ash" four years ago, entered the port and docked, and sent them off with the song "Don't Let Atomic Disaster Happen Again." The marchers also went to pay tribute to Aikichi Kuboyama's grave. The atomic square tombstone reminded people of a sentence Kuboyama said: "Don't let anyone else become a victim of the hydrogen bomb besides me!" With deep condolences for the victims, the marchers resumed their peaceful journey.
    In places where the march did not pass, such as Mie Prefecture, a peace march was organized within the prefecture; Nagasaki, Aomori and other prefectures participated in the national bicycle relay peace march. The slogan of stopping nuclear armament and upholding democracy has penetrated all parts of Japan, and almost all classes have been involved in this movement. Standing at the forefront of the movement are the Japanese working class, the Japanese Communist Party, peace organizations, and many people's organizations. Many foreign representatives who came to Japan to attend the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament also participated in the peace march in many places.
    However, during the Diet convened during the peace march, the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government refused to explicitly state that it would not arm Japan with nuclear weapons. This made the participants in the peace march and the vast number of peace-loving Japanese people feel that in order to defend peace, they still have to overcome many difficulties and make many efforts. The struggle to defend peace will certainly not end with the arrival of the peace march in Tokyo. The seeds have been sown, and we must let them sprout, blossom, and bear fruit! (August 1)

### 从广岛到东京的一千公里和平大游行

　　从广岛到东京的一千公里和平大游行
　　蓝海
    日本现在有一批为和平而斗争的人们，正在沿着从广岛到东京的一千公里道路上前进。沿路不断有人接力式地参加到他们的行列里来，并且到处有人集会欢迎他们。他们像是宣传队，也像是播种队。他们宣传的是禁止原子弹氢弹，反对核武装。他们散播的是和平的种子，民主的种子。这就是从广岛到东京的“阻止核武装和拥护民主一千公里和平大游行”的队伍。
    和平大游行是由日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会发起的。游行在日本“阻止核武装和拥护民主国民运动月”的第一天6月20日，从广岛市原子弹牺牲者慰灵塔前出发，目的地是在东京召开的第四届禁
      止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的会场。
    游行队伍从广岛出发的时候，只有一百五十多人。他们人数不多，但都是一些为和平不屈不挠进行着斗争的人们。有一位失掉一只腿的和平活动家沟口年男先生，也坐了小车由他的夫人推着参加了游行。他坚持要“一直走到东京去”。只是由于日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会工作人员的耐心的劝阻，他才放弃了这个念头。他在广岛市边上，挥着手送别了继续游行的和平的战友。
    游行队伍出了广岛市，走在濑户内海岸边道路上的时候，只剩下了七个人。其中预定走完全部行程的，只有日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会派来的一位宗教家西本笃。但是这个小小的队伍，随着它前进的脚步，却一天天吸引了越来越多的人。现在，它已经发展成上千人的大游行队伍了。沿路随时参加游行的人，到7月29日累计已达四十万人。从半路上参加进来，自愿走完全部行程的人也不断增加。除西本笃外，又有基督教女牧师增本紫云，佛教僧侣藤田日迁、龙武一郎、天理教徒本岛泰女士、关西学联的代表和各县代表等许多人决心一直走到东京。
    热爱和平、为保卫和平而斗争的，绝不是少数人。这在游行的头几天里就得到了充分的证明。关心这次和平大游行的，已经不仅仅是各地的禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会和和平组织。各个市、町、村当局也不能不出来对这件和平壮举表示欢迎。在兵库县濑户町，七十四岁的老町长，就和游行队伍一道走了六公里。在各地，临时参加游行的，不仅有当地的和平活动家和工会会员，而且有当地青年组织、妇女组织的成员、学生和儿童。系着围裙、穿着木屐、提着买东西的篮子的主妇们，说“抽空能参加一会儿就参加一会儿”，也跟着队伍一起游行。和平大游行给他们带来了鼓舞和勇气，在他们心头燃起了为捍卫和平而斗争的火炬。
    7月6日，游行队伍正在炎阳下，沿着公路，从兵库县的加古川走向明石的时候，特意远道从神户赶来的二十几名高中学生加入了他们的行列。这些学生说：游行队伍通过神户市的时候，学校里有课，所以选了星期天，跑来参加游行。
    6日晚上各报晚刊一齐报道美国在恩尼威托克岛继续试验氢弹。这引起了人们的极大愤怒，他们认为这是对日本人民的和平行动的挑衅。第二天，工会的地区协议会的代表和明石市的市长、市议会议长等都参加了游行。
    7月9日，游行队伍已经走过四百公里，进入大阪市，第二天早晨，在大阪市内中之岛公园举行集会，然后在市内最主要街道举行了游行。队伍走过大阪总评建筑物前面时，从欢迎人群中抛出了无数五彩缤纷的纸条；在通过长柄桥的时候，由人群中放出十几只和平鸽，在晴空翱翔，祝福游行者前进，再前进！
    7月19日，和平游行队伍到达名古屋后，同名古屋市各界人民一千五百多人举行了“阻止核武装和拥护民主”大会，西本笃在大会上谴责美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，认为这是对世界和平的威胁。最后，大会通过决议，要求美英立即把军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，并要求日本政府宣布不用核武器武装日本。
    7月29日，已经走了八百公里的游行者，到达静冈县的烧津市。这是久保山爱吉——美国氢弹试验的第一个牺牲者的故乡。久保山的遗妻和老母都参加了游行。第二天，游行者出了烧津市，路过烧津渔港，渔船船员们把四年前落满了“死灰”的第五福龙丸进港靠岸的地方指给他们看，又在“不许原子灾难重演”的歌声里送走了他们。游行者还去祭扫了久保山爱吉的坟墓。那原子方型的墓碑，使人们记起久保山说过的一句话：“氢弹的受害者，除了我之外，不要再有任何人了！”游行者怀着对于牺牲者的沉痛的悼念，重新走上他们的和平行程。
    游行不经过的地方，例如三重县组织了县内的和平游行；长崎、青森等县参加了全国自行车接力和平游行。阻止核武装和拥护民主的口号，已经深入日本的各个地方，几乎所有的阶层都卷入了这个运动。而站在运动前头的则是日本的工人阶级、日本共产党、和平组织和许多人民团体。到日本出席第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的许多外国代表也在许多地方参加了和平大游行。
    但是，岸信介反动政府在和平大游行进行期间召开的国会上，却拒绝明确表示不用核武器武装日本。这使和平游行的参加者以及广大的爱好和平的日本人民不能不感到：为了保卫和平，他们还要突破很多困难，进行很多努力。保卫和平的斗争，当然不会以和平大游行到达东京而告结束。种子撒下去了，那就要让它抽芽、开花、结果！（8月1日）
