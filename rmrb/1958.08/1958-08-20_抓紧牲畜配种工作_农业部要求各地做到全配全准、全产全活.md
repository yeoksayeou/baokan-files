Xinhua News Agency Report: Some areas across the country have already planted "full of pregnancy" red flags in the great leap forward of draft animal breeding. Currently, various regions are continuing livestock breeding, and the mass movement to strive for full mating of female animals and full survival of young animals is further unfolding.

In order to enable agricultural cooperatives to rapidly breed draft animals to adapt to the needs of using new farm tools and the great leap forward in agricultural production, breeding and reproduction work for draft animals has been carried out nationwide since this spring. The breeding season for yellow cattle, horses, and donkeys has not yet passed, and water buffalo will soon begin their autumn breeding season.

The reporter learned from the Ministry of Agriculture that, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-five provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, a total of 11,870,000 female animals have been bred in the first half of this year, accounting for 57% of all adult female animals. Among them, in Henan Province, female animals that have been bred and are pregnant or have given birth for less than three months account for 83% of adult female animals, achieving the requirement of "full of pregnancy" ahead of schedule. In Hebei Province, female animals that have been bred and are pregnant account for 94% of adult female animals, with eighty-four counties (cities) achieving full mating, and thirty-nine counties (cities) achieving full mating and full accuracy, reaching "full of pregnancy."

This year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also done a good job in nursing pregnant animals and young animals, resulting in high survival rates of young animals and net increase rates of draft animals. A survey of fifty counties (cities) in Gansu Province shows that more than 100,000 young animals have been produced in the first half of the year, with a survival rate of over 90%. Many regions and agricultural cooperatives have basically achieved the goal of every birth being a live birth.

In the work of breeding draft animals, various regions have also paid attention to livestock breed improvement. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, thirty-four bull breeding stations use dairy bulls as breeding bulls to develop dual-purpose (draft and milk) cattle; in Baiquan County, more than 90% of mares this year were bred with superior breeds, basically realizing the improvement of horse breeds. The breeding stations in various regions generally select excellent breeding livestock. In particular, the development of artificial insemination stations has played a significant role in livestock breed improvement.

Since spring this year, the national draft animal breeding work has formed a continuous mass movement, but the development of the movement is still uneven. Some individual regions still have ideas of waiting for mechanization and have not grasped the breeding work and reproduction of young animals tightly. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that it is very important to correct this phenomenon and grasp the current autumn breeding work; and requires all regions to make persistent efforts to achieve full mating and full accuracy, full production and full survival, and full strength.

Henan, Hebei, Jiangxi and other nine provinces have a number of counties with full pregnant livestock.
According to statistics at the end of June 1958

### 抓紧牲畜配种工作　农业部要求各地做到全配全准、全产全活

　　抓紧牲畜配种工作
　　农业部要求各地做到全配全准、全产全活
    据新华社讯  全国已经有部分地区在耕畜繁殖的大跃进中插了“满怀”红旗。现在，各地耕畜还在继续配种，争取母畜全配、幼畜全活的群众运动还在进一步展开。
    为使农业社迅速繁殖耕畜，来适应使用新式农具和农业生产大跃进的需要，今年春天以来全国一直在开展耕畜的配种繁殖工作。黄牛、马和驴的配种季节现在还未过去，水牛又将开始秋季配种。
  记者从农业部获悉：据二十五个省、市、区的不完全统计，今年上半年已经配种的母畜共达一千一百八十七万头，占全部成年母畜的57％。其中，河南省配种怀胎和产仔不满三月的母畜已占成年母畜的83％，提前实现了“满怀”的要求。河北省已配种和已怀胎的母畜占成年母畜的94％，有八十四个全配的县（市），有三十九个县（市）全配全准，达到“满怀”。
    今年各地农业社对孕畜和幼畜的护养工作也作得很好，幼畜成活率和耕畜净增率都高。甘肃省五十个县（市）调查，上半年已产幼畜十万多头，成活90％以上。不少地区和农业社基本做到了产一头活一头。
    在耕畜的配种工作中各地还注意了畜种改良。如黑龙江省有三十四个公牛配种站是用奶公牛作种牛，来发展役乳兼用的牛；拜泉县今年90％以上的母马都是良种配的，基本实现了马种改良工作。各地配种站一般都选用的是优良种畜。特别是人工授精站的发展，对畜种改良作用很大。
    今年全国耕畜配种工作从春天以来就形成了一个持续的群众运动，但运动发展仍不平衡，还有个别地区有等待机械化等思想，对配种工作和繁殖幼畜抓得不紧。农业部认为：纠正这个现象，抓紧当前的秋配工作很重要；并要求各地再接再厉作到全配全准、全产全活和全壮。
