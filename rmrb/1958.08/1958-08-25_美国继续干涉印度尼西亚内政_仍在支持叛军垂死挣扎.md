Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 24th: Antara News Agency reported on the 23rd that there are clear indications that the "Charter of Overall Struggle" rebel group in North Sulawesi is still receiving support from a certain foreign source.

The revealed material clearly shows that the United States is still propping up the nearly defeated Indonesian rebel group and providing great convenience to the North Sulawesi rebels by using military bases in the southern Philippines.

Antara News Agency quoted Lieutenant Colonel Rukminto, the commander of the Indonesian government forces' North Sulawesi operational area, as saying that in the days leading up to the government forces' recapture of Domohon in early August, unidentified aircraft dropped equipment to the rebels' Galawiran Airport and Dasuga Airport south of Domohon. Both airports are in the Gawangkang area. After the government forces recaptured Domohon, the rebels fled to Gawangkang. The rebels are currently trying to use these two airports as places to receive foreign airdropped supplies.

Antara News Agency said that before Indonesia's National Day on August 17th, the rebels attacked Manado in an attempt to create chaos. A B-26 aircraft invaded the territorial waters near Bitung and Gema near Manado on August 12th and strafed fishing boats with machine guns. However, it did not dare to fly close to the government forces' positions.

Lieutenant Colonel Rukminto pointed out that this B-26 aircraft was likely taking off from air force bases in the southern Philippines, because the Galawiran and Dasuga airports currently under rebel control cannot be used by B-26 aircraft. Not long ago, the head of the Indonesian Air Force Intelligence Department also announced that unidentified aircraft had been discovered in Kalimantan and South Sumatra.

Antara News Agency also reported that the weapons seized by the Indonesian government forces from the rebels in Domohon and other places in North Sulawesi were manufactured in the United States, and some of the seized bullets bore the marks of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

When the rebels fled, they left behind several books published by the U.S. Department of Defense on the use of new types of weapons.

　　美国继续干涉印度尼西亚内政
    仍在支持叛军垂死挣扎
    新华社雅加达24日电　安塔拉通讯社23日说，目前有明显的迹象表明：北苏拉威西的“全面斗争约章”叛乱集团现在还继续得到国外某方面所给予的接济。
    据揭发的材料显明，美国还在支撑濒于复灭的印度尼西亚叛乱集团，并且对北苏拉威西叛乱分子使用菲律宾南部的军事基地给予很大的便利。
    安塔拉通讯社引述印度尼西亚政府军北苏拉威西地区作战司令鲁克明托中校的话说，在8月初政府军收复多莫洪的前几天，有国籍不明的飞机向多莫洪以南的加拉威兰机场和达苏加机场的叛军空投装备。这两个机场都在加旺哥安地区。在政府军收复多莫洪以后，叛军就逃往加旺哥安。叛军目前正在极力利用这两个机场作为接收外国空投接济物资的地方。
    安塔拉通讯社说，在8月17日印度尼西亚国庆日之前，叛军曾经攻击万鸦老，企图制造混乱。一架B—26型飞机在8月12日侵犯靠近万鸦老的比东和格马的领海，并且用机枪扫射渔船。但是，它不敢飞近政府军的阵地。
    鲁克明托中校指出，这架B—26型飞机很可能就是从菲律宾南部的空军基地起飞的，因为现在在叛军控制下的加拉威兰和达苏加机场都不能供B—26型飞机使用。不久以前，印度尼西亚空军情报处负责人也曾经宣布，在加里曼丹和南苏门答腊发现过国籍不明的飞机。
    安塔拉通讯社还报道说，印度尼西亚政府军从多莫洪和北苏拉威西其他地方的叛军那里缴获的武器是美国制造的，也有一部分缴获的子弹带有蒋介石集团的标志。
    叛军在逃跑的时候，留下了几本美国国防部出版的关于使用新型武器的书。
