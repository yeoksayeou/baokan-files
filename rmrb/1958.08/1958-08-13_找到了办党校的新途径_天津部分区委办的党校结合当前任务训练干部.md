Found a New Way to Run Party Schools
　　Party Schools Run by Party Committees in Tianjin Combine Training of Cadres with Current Tasks

This newspaper reports that the Party Committees in Tianjin are implementing the principle of combining theory with practice and adopting the mass line to run Party schools in a lively and dynamic manner. This has found a new way to cultivate and train Party member cadres in a way that is faster, better, and more economical. At present, the four districts of Xinhua, Hongqiao, Hexi, and Hebei in the city have established Party schools. The Nancang Township Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Beijiao District has also jointly established a Party school with cadres from the Tianjin Municipal Party School who have been transferred to lower levels. Some district and Party committees have also held short-term training classes for theoretical work cadres or propaganda cadres with the same nature and tasks as Party schools. More than 850 students are studying in Party schools and training classes.

When running Party schools, the district and Party committees proceed from the General Line, from the current practical struggle, and from the specific objectives of different Party member cadres. In terms of teaching content, they mainly study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, closely combined with the current central tasks. In order to quickly cultivate a group of backbone forces at the beginning of each central task, the Xinhua and Hongqiao District Party Schools have also attached short-term training classes for central tasks. In terms of the organizational form and training time of the schools, flexible and diverse methods have also been adopted according to the different work conditions of each unit. The Party schools run by the four districts of Xinhua, Hebei, Hexi, and Hongqiao adopted the method of off-the-job commuting. The Hebei District Party Committee, in view of the difficulty for some Party members in the industrial and financial and trade systems to study full-time, specifically attached an evening training class to train this group of people. The short-term training classes run by the Nankai District Committee and the Public Security Party Committee adopted a half-work, half-study format, with half a day of work and half a day of study. The study time is sometimes three months, sometimes one month, and sometimes several weeks. In this way, the study period for students is not too long, so as not to affect work; at the same time, it is closely combined with the current practical struggle, making it easier to achieve the effect of combining theory with practice.

These Party schools have adopted lively and dynamic forms in their learning methods. During the study period, they made full use of big-character posters and the methods of full airing of views and great debates, established opposing sides, and launched debates. The Hexi District Party School posted more than 3,000 big-character posters in a few days during the study of the General Line, fully opened up their minds, and criticized various bourgeois individualism and right-leaning conservative ideas, which greatly improved the thinking of the students. Each Party school also adopted the practice of combining the study of theory, the study of policies, the summarization of work, and the writing of articles. Some Party schools also used the method of combining visits and inspections with lectures. For example, when talking about the General Line, they organized students to visit the technical innovation competition conference.

When running Party schools, the district and Party committees implemented the mass line method and mobilized the entire Party to run Party schools. The secretaries of the district and Party committees took the lead, and the heads of relevant departments participated in the research and formulation of teaching plans and served as teachers. All units also vigorously assisted in solving problems such as lecture locations and drinking water for students. People participating in the study "everyone is a student, everyone is a teacher," inspiring each other and conducting self-education. Therefore, these Party schools only have a few cadres from the district committee responsible for organizational work, and the Party schools are run vigorously.

The Party schools run by the district and Party committees have promoted the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily, and have tried their best to save expenses. Food and accommodation are taken care of by the students themselves, and the auditoriums are borrowed for lectures, and discussions and reading of documents are carried out in decentralized activities in classes and groups. Tables and stools are borrowed from various agencies, and learning supplies are brought by the students. In this way, a large amount of expenses is saved. The municipal Party committee sends a total of 500 yuan per month to each district to run Party schools, which is actually not used up. Some districts only spent a few dozen yuan. However, it would cost 7 million yuan to build a new Party school that can train 2,000 people.

In order to promote the experience of running Party schools in Xinhua and other districts, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting on the 11th attended by district committee secretaries, propaganda ministers, and others. (Attached picture)

　　找到了办党校的新途径
　　天津部分区委办的党校结合当前任务训练干部
    本报讯　天津市部分区委、党委贯彻理论与实际相结合的方针，采取群众路线的方法，生动活泼的形式办党校，为多快好省地培养训练党员干部找到了一条新的途径。目前，全市已有新华、红桥、河西、河北四个区办起了党校，北郊区的南仓乡中共委员会，也和中共天津市委党校下放干部合办了一所党校，部分区委，党委也举办了与党校性质、任务相同的理论工作干部或宣传干部短期训练班。在党校、训练班学习的学员有八百五十多人。
    各区委、党委在举办党校时，都是从总路线、从当前现实斗争出发，从不同党员干部的具体对象出发，在教学内容上，主要学习毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”和刘少奇同志在八大二次会议上的报告等，紧密结合当前的中心工作。为了使每一个中心工作到来之初，能够迅速地培养出一批骨干力量，新华、红桥两个区委党校，还附设了中心工作短期训练班。在学校的组织形式和训练时间上，也根据各单位不同的工作情况，采取了灵活多样的办法。新华、河北、河西、红桥四个区举办的党校，采用了脱职走读的办法。河北区委党校针对工业、财贸系统中有些党员脱产学习比较困难的情况，特附设了一个业余训练班，专门训练这一批人。南开区委和公安党委举办的短期训练班，采取了半工半读的形式，半天工作，半天学习。学习时间有的三个月，有的一个月，有的几个星期。这样，学员学习期间不太长，不致影响工作；同时又与当前实际斗争紧密结合，更容易收到理论与实际相结合的效果。
    这些党校在学习方法上采取了生动活泼的形式。在学习期间，充分运用了大字报、大鸣大放的方法，树立对立面，展开辩论。河西区党校在学习总路线时，几天中就贴出三千多张大字报，充分敞开了思想，批判了各种资产阶级个人主义、右倾保守思想，使学员们思想大大提高了一步。各党校还采取了把学习理论，研究政策，总结工作，撰写文章四者结合起来的作法。有的党校，在讲课时还配合参观访问的方法。如讲总路线时，就组织学员们参观技术革新比武大会。
    各区委、党委举办党校时，贯彻执行了群众路线的方法，发动全党办党校。各区委、党委书记动手，各有关部门负责人参加研究制定教学计划，并担任教员。各单位也大力协助，解决讲课地点、学员饮水等问题。参加学习的人“人人做学生，人人做先生”，互相启发，进行自我教育。因此这些党校只有区委几个干部负责组织工作，党校办的生气勃勃。
    各区委、党委举办的党校，都发扬了勤俭办校的精神，尽量节省经费开支。食宿由学员自理，讲课时借礼堂，讨论、读文件时以班、组为单位分散活动。桌子、凳子是借用各机关的，习学用品是学员带来的。这样，节省了大批经费。市委每月发给各区办党校的经费一共五百元，实际上都用不完。有的区只花了几十元。而新建一所可训练二千人的党校，却需要七百万元。
    为了推广新华等区办党校的经验，中共天津市委在11日召开了区委书记、宣传部长等人参加的会议。（附图片）
