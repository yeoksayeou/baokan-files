Limitless Potential, Bottomless Production
Reporter's Commentary on Large-Scale Increased Production of Early Rice in Hubei

    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reporter's commentary on Hubei's achievement of large-scale, balanced increased production of early rice stated: As of now, Hubei Province has seen large-scale, balanced increased production of early rice in areas such as Qichun County, where 170,000 mu of early rice averaged 1,200 jin per mu; Xiaogan County, where 300,000 mu of early rice averaged 1,757 jin per mu; the new rice area of Macheng County, where 73,000 mu of early rice averaged 1,232 jin per mu; and Xiaogan Prefecture, where 1,490,000 mu of early rice averaged 1,089 jin per mu. These indicators of large-scale, high-yield early rice not only far exceed last year's provincial average early rice yield of 200-300 jin per mu, but also approach and surpass last year's provincial record high yield of 1,700 jin per mu. This leap in production makes people deeply understand the truth that "potential is limitless, and production has no bottom."

    The achievement of large-scale, balanced increased production of early rice is inseparable from the struggle against conservatism. Conservatives believe that the yields in many areas had already reached a high level of production last year (such as Xiaogan County's total grain yield exceeding the 1,000 jin mark); the remaining areas have complex terrain and uneven soil quality; and according to past experience, natural disasters are frequent every year… Therefore, they believe that achieving large-scale increased production is difficult. Yes, these are objective realities. However, people understand that everything develops through contradiction and struggle; where there are difficulties, there are ways to solve them; difficulties themselves contain the factors for solving them; the key is whether people dare to exert a high degree of subjective initiative. Because people's minds have been liberated and their enthusiasm is soaring, despite the continuous attacks of cold waves, hailstorms, wind disasters, waterlogging, and droughts after transplanting the seedlings, people took measures such as transplanting seedlings, replanting seedlings, and fighting drought to overcome the disasters; despite the poor soil quality in many areas, people intensified deep plowing and fertilization to improve the soil; despite the emergence of third-class seedlings in many areas, people eliminated them. All of this has ensured the realization of large-scale, balanced increased production.

    Another reason for the large-scale, balanced increased production of early rice is the planting of experimental fields. According to statistics from 1,490,000 mu of early rice in Xiaogan Prefecture, one-third of it was experimental fields, and 1,200,000 people participated in planting experimental fields. They—especially cadres at all levels—have a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and they boldly use and create new technologies. They promoted the successful experience of the experiments to the masses through on-site meetings, visits, and comparisons, truly playing a role in guiding production and promoting production, so that the early rice in the entire township, district, and county achieved large-scale increased production. Judging from the current harvesting situation, the yield of the cadres' early rice experimental fields is higher than that of the ordinary fields of the masses, but there are also cases where the yield of the ordinary fields of the masses is higher than that of the cadres' experimental fields, because they have made new developments in applying the successful experience of the experimental fields. This phenomenon reflects the great significance of simultaneously cultivating experimental fields and large-scale high-yield fields, which has a positive effect on promoting large-scale, balanced increased production.

    The large-scale, balanced increased production of early rice has further liberated people's minds. People know that the yield of early rice has always been lower than that of mid-season rice, and even lower than that of single-season late rice. Now that early rice can achieve large-scale, balanced increased production, then mid-season rice and late rice can achieve even greater large-scale, balanced increased production. Now people are summarizing the experience of large-scale, balanced increased production of early rice to promote it to single-season late rice and double-season late rice, and are revising the plans for single-season late rice and double-season late rice.

　　潜力无穷　增产无底
　　记者评述湖北早稻大面积增产
    本报讯　本报记者述评湖北早稻获得大面积平衡增产称：截至目前为止，湖北省早稻出现大面积平衡增产的有蕲春县十七万亩早稻平均单产一千二百斤，孝感县三十万亩早稻平均单产一千七百五十七斤，麻城县新稻区七万三千亩早稻平均单产一千二百三十二斤，孝感专区一百四十九万亩早稻平均单产一千零八十九斤。这些早稻大面积丰产的指标，不仅远远超过去年全省早稻平均单产二、三百斤的指标，而且也接近和超过去年全省早稻最高的单产纪录一千七百斤的指标。这个飞跃式的增产，使人们深深体会到“潜力无穷，产量无底”的真理。
    早稻获得大面积平衡增产是和保守主义者作斗争分不开的。保守主义者认为：去年许多地区的产量已经达到增产的高度（如孝感全县的粮食单产突破千斤大关）；其余的地区地形复杂，土质好坏不匀；根据以往的经验，每年的自然灾害是频繁的……因此他们认为实现大面积增产有困难。是的，这些都是客观存在。但是，人们懂得，任何事物都在矛盾斗争中发展着，有困难就有解决困难的办法，困难本身就包含解决困难的因素，问题的关键在于人们敢不敢发挥高度的主观能动性。由于人们思想解放了，干劲冲天。尽管下秧以后，寒潮、雹灾、风灾、渍水灾、旱灾等连续不断的袭击，人们采取移苗、补苗、抗旱等措施，把灾害战胜了；尽管有许多地区土质不好，人们加紧深耕、施肥，把土壤改良了；尽管有不少地区出现了三类苗，人们把它消灭了。所有这些，就保证了大面积平衡增产的实现。
    早稻获得大面积平衡增产的另一个原因是种试验田。据孝感专区一百四十九万亩早稻统计，就有三分之一是试验田，参加种试验田的有一百二十万人。他们——特别是各级干部们——具有敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，他们大胆地使用和创造新技术。他们把试验成功的经验，通过现场会议，参观评比，推广到群众中去，真正发挥了指导生产和推动生产的作用，使全乡、全区、全县的早稻获得了大面积增产。从目前收割情况来看，干部的早稻试验田的产量比群众的一般田的产量高，但是也有群众的一般田的产量比干部的试验田高，因他们运用试验田的成功经验时，有了新的发展。这种现象正体现了培育试验田和大面积丰产田同时并举的重大意义，这对促进大面积平衡增产有积极作用。
    早稻获得大面积平衡增产，使人们进一步解放了思想。人们知道，早稻产量一向比中稻低，比一季晚稻更低，现在早稻既然可以获得大面积平衡增产，那么中稻和晚稻更可以获得大面积平衡增产。现在人们正在总结早稻大面积平衡增产经验推广到一季晚稻和二季晚稻去，并重新修订一季晚稻和二季晚稻的规划。
