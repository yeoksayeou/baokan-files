Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 2nd - The "Hindustan Times" said in today's news commentary that Dulles' remarks at a New York press conference, refusing to allow India to participate in the heads of government meeting to discuss the Middle East issue, have caused great dissatisfaction here.

"Indian Express" said that it is very clear that India does not agree with Dulles' attitude regarding the scope and participating members of the proposed heads of government meeting.

When news of Dulles' remarks reached here, many journalists angrily said that this was an insult to India.

Observers here say that India is concerned that Dulles' stubborn attitude will have serious repercussions for the future of the meeting itself. It is believed here that his remarks are one of the many obstacles set up by the United States to obstruct the convening of the heads of government meeting, and evidence of the United States' lack of sincerity.

Public opinion here particularly expressed contempt for Dulles' statement that he wanted to discuss "accusations of aggression and indirect aggression" at the meeting. One journalist here said that Dulles himself had carried out indirect aggression against India by calling India's territory of Goa a "Portuguese province."

Newspapers here also published news from abroad that Dulles had assured Macmillan that "the United States will not withdraw from" Lebanon "in the near future." These newspapers also published news about the United States sending additional troops to Lebanon.

    杜勒斯出口侮辱印度印度
    舆论深表愤慨
    新华社新德里2日电  “印度斯坦时报”在今天的新闻评论中说，杜勒斯在纽约记者招待会上表示拒绝让印度参加讨论中东问题的政府首脑会议的谈话引起了这里巨大的不满。
    “印度快报”说，十分明显，印度不赞同杜勒斯关于拟议中的政府首脑会议的范围和参加成员的问题所抱的态度。
    当有关杜勒斯的谈话的消息传到这里的时候，许多新闻记者愤慨地说，这是对印度的侮辱。
    这里的观察家们说，印度担心，杜勒斯的顽固态度将对于会议本身的前途引起严重的反响。这里认为，他的谈话是美国为阻挠政府首脑会议的召开所设置的许多障碍之一，并且是美国没有诚意的证据。
    这里的舆论对于杜勒斯表示要在会议中讨论关于“侵略和间接侵略的指责”这句话特别表示轻蔑。这里的一位新闻记者说，杜勒斯本人就对印度进行了间接侵略，他把印度的领土果阿说成是“葡萄牙的省份”。
    这里的报纸还刊载国外发来的消息说，杜勒斯已经向麦克米伦保证，“美国不会近期撤出”黎巴嫩。这些报纸还刊载了美国增派军队到黎巴嫩的消息。
