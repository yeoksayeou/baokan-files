    The U.S. invading forces in Lebanon are planning for a long-term occupation. According to Beirut newspapers, the U.S. military command has begun renting houses for a period of six months. U.S. embassy personnel in Lebanon admit that they are negotiating with the Chamoun government to sign supply contracts worth $100,000, including the rental of warehouses and barracks. Furthermore, according to West German news agencies, the U.S. military is converting a football field in Beirut into a new helicopter landing pad, and another helicopter base is under development. Meanwhile, Agence France-Presse reports that the United States has also sent three railway experts and a port facility expert to Amman to "be responsible for implementing the plan for a railway line extending to the Gulf of Aqaba and expanding" the port of Amman.

    Anyone can see clearly that these actions cannot have any other explanation than to show that the U.S. and British invaders intend to maintain their aggressive strongholds in Arab countries for a considerable period.

    People still remember that when U.S. President's "Special Envoy" Murphy was running around the capitals of Arab countries, he exhausted his efforts to offer "guarantees" that the U.S. and Britain had no intention of aggression. Facts have proven that Murphy's "guarantees" were just one smokescreen after another.

    侵黎美军是在作长期盘踞的打算了。据贝鲁特报纸报道，美军司令部开始租房子，期限是六个月。美国驻黎大使馆人员承认，他们正同夏蒙政府谈判签订价值十万美元的供应合同，包括租用仓库和营房。另据西德通讯社报道：美军正在把贝鲁特的一个足球场改建为一个直升飞机的新着陆场，另一个直升飞机基地在开辟中。与此同时，法新社消息说，美国还派出三名铁路专家和一名港口设施专家到安曼，“负责执行伸延到亚喀巴湾的铁路线的计划和扩建”安曼港。
    任何人都看得清清楚楚，这些行动不可能有任何别的解释，只能说明，美英侵略者要相当长期地保持在阿拉伯国家的侵略据点。
    人们都还记得，美国总统“特使”墨菲奔走在阿拉伯各国首都时，曾用尽力气提出“保证”，说美英没有侵略的意图。事实证明，墨菲的“保证”只是一个接一个放出的烟幕弹而已。
