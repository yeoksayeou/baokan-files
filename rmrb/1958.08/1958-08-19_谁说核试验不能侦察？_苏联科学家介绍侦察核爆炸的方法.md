Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 18th: Modern science possesses methods to detect atomic explosions conducted anywhere on Earth from a single location, according to an article published in "Red Star" by Soviet Doctor of Chemistry, Neiman. The article introduces four of the most commonly used methods.

    The first method is measurement using seismographs. The article states that atomic explosions cause powerful mechanical waves that can propagate through the air, water, and Earth's crust. The crustal waves caused by atomic explosions are different from those caused by earthquakes. Based on the signals recorded by seismographs, the time, location, and intensity of any nuclear explosion can be determined.

    The second method is reconnaissance using acoustic instruments. Atomic explosions can form air compression shock waves, creating ultra-low-frequency sound waves that can propagate over long distances. These ultra-low-frequency sound waves can be received using specialized acoustic instruments called microbarographs.

    The third method is radio measurement. During an atomic bomb explosion, a chain reaction of plutonium or uranium fission occurs. During a thermonuclear bomb explosion, nuclear fusion of light elements such as hydrogen and lithium also occurs. In these reactions, charged nuclei and electrons fly off, creating electromagnetic waves. These radio pulses can be recorded at any location on Earth using specialized radio receiving devices.

    The fourth method is collecting air samples at high altitudes for research. Atomic explosions produce radioactive fission fragments of plutonium, uranium, and other substances. The cloud formed during the explosion also contains radioactive carbon dioxide. Hydrogen bomb explosions produce a radioactive isotope of hydrogen called tritium. Air currents carry these substances to any location on Earth. Air samples can be taken at very high altitudes using aircraft equipped with special instruments. By observing the radioactive fission fragments over a long period of time, the time of the explosion can be determined.

    The article concludes by stating that the combined application of all these methods can accurately and unmistakably determine the fact of a nuclear weapons test, its nature, location, and time.

　　谁说核试验不能侦察？
　　苏联科学家介绍侦察核爆炸的方法
    新华社莫斯科18日电　现代科学拥有的方法，可以在一个地方发现地球上任何地点进行的原子爆炸，这是苏联化学博士涅伊曼在“红星报”上发表的文章中说的。文章介绍了最常用的四种方法。
    第一种方法是用地震仪测量。文章说，原子爆炸会造成可以在空气、水和地壳中传播的强大力学波动。原子爆炸造成的地壳波动同地震造成的是不同的。根据地震仪记录到的讯号可以确定任何地方核爆炸的时间、地点和强度。
    第二种方法是利用声学仪器侦察。原子爆炸时可以形成空气疏密冲击波，造成可以传播很远的超低声波。这种超低声波可以利用特制的声学仪器—微压记录器接收到。
    第三种方法是用无线电测量。在原子弹爆炸时会发生钚或铀裂变的链式反应。在热核炸弹爆炸时还会发生像氢和锂这样轻元素的核聚变。在这些反应中会有带电的原子核和电子飞开来，造成电磁波。这种无线电脉冲可以在地球上任何一个地点用专门的无线电接收装置记录到。
    第四种方法是在高空中取空气试样进行研究。原子爆炸时会产生钚、铀和其它物质的放射性裂变碎片。在爆炸时形成的云中还含有放射性二氧化碳。氢弹爆炸时会产生氢的放射性同位素—氚。空气流会把这些物质传播到地球上任何地点。用带有特殊仪器的飞机在很高的高空中就可以取到空气试样。根据对放射性裂变碎片的长时间观察，就可以确定爆炸的时间。
    文章最后说，把所有这些方法结合起来运用，可以准确无误地确定核武器试验的事实、它的性质、地点和时间。
