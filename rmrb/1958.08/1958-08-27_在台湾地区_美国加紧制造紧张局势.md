　　The United States Intensifies the Creation of Tensions
　　Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The United States military has recently intensified the creation of tensions in the Taiwan area, seriously threatening our country's security.
　　According to an Associated Press report, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley announced in Yokosuka, Japan, on the 25th that the U.S. Navy and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's navy will hold joint exercises in Fangliao, southern Taiwan, in early September. Bickley said: The purpose of this joint exercise is to improve the "proficiency in planning and executing joint military operations between the U.S. military and the Chiang bandit troops, as well as to improve, develop, and evaluate the technology and principles of joint operations." This U.S. military commander stationed in Taiwan also said that this exercise is also to "further enhance" the "close working relationship between" the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "navy and marines."
　　Bickley visited Taiwan from the 21st to the 23rd and met with Chiang Kai-shek. The commander of the U.S. Navy Taiwan Patrol Force, under the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Blackburn, arrived in Zuoying, Taiwan, on the 25th to "jointly review the recent situation in the Taiwan Strait" with senior Chiang gang naval officers. The commander of the U.S. 13th Air Force, Thomas Mooreman, left Clark U.S. Air Force Base in the Philippines on the 26th and flew to Taipei for activities.
　　The day before Bickley announced the joint U.S.-Chiang military exercises, the U.S. Department of Defense issued a statement on the 24th, using the excuse of the so-called "increased activity in the Taiwan Strait area," announcing that it had ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet and other U.S. naval forces in the Far East to take so-called "normal precautionary defensive measures." According to U.S. reporters traveling with the Seventh Fleet, the U.S. Air Force and Navy are openly patrolling less than twelve miles from the mainland.
　　Commander of the U.S. Naval Forces in Japan, Wissington, said in Yokosuka on the 25th that ships and personnel under his command were in a state of "increased alert." According to Washington reports, other U.S. naval forces throughout the Far East have also been ordered to enter a state of alert, and warships anchored in the waters off Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii may go to reinforce the Seventh Fleet.
　　Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Singapore news: Under the strong condemnation of people from all countries, the eight U.S. warships and approximately two thousand Marines that came to Singapore two weeks ago to conduct military provocations left Singapore in their entirety this morning. According to a communique issued by the U.S. Consulate General in Singapore, they will proceed to Okinawa.
　　According to Western news agencies, this batch of U.S. warships will rejoin the U.S. Seventh Fleet and participate in the Seventh Fleet's military activities of creating tensions in the Far East. According to personnel from the U.S. Marines who left Singapore, this batch of warships and Marine soldiers are preparing to participate in the military exercises to be held by the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the Chiang Kai-shek group's navy in Fangliao, southern Taiwan, in early September.
　　According to Western news agencies, the first to leave Singapore on the 25th was the U.S. fleet's supply ship "Aludra." Subsequently, on the 26th, at dawn and early morning, the other seven warships left one after another, carrying away all of the U.S. Marines.

　　在台湾地区
    美国加紧制造紧张局势
    新华社26日讯　美国军队最近加紧制造台湾地区的紧张局势，严重威胁我国的安全。
    据美联社消息，美国第七舰队司令比克利25日在日本横须贺宣布，美国海军和蒋介石卖国集团的海军将于9月初在台湾南部枋寮举行联合演习。比克利说：这次联合演习的目的是提高美军和蒋贼军之间的“联合军事行动的计划和执行方面的熟练程度，以及改进、发展和估计联合行动的技术和原则。”这个侵台美军将领还说，这次演习也为了“进一步增进”美军和蒋介石卖国集团的“海军及海军陆战队之间密切的工作关系”。
    比克利曾在21日到23日抵台湾活动，并且和蒋介石会谈。美国第七舰队辖下的美国海军台湾巡逻舰队司令勃莱克本，在25日到达台湾左营，和蒋帮海军高级将领“共同检讨台湾海峡的最近情势”。美国第十三航空队司令托马斯·穆尔曼在26日离开菲律宾的克拉克美国空军基地，飞往台北活动。
    在比克利宣布美蒋举行联合军事演习的前一天，美国国防部在24日发表声明，以所谓“鉴于台湾海峡地区的活动有所增加”为借口，宣布已经命令美国第七舰队和在远东的美国其他海军部队采取所谓
  “正常的预防性防御措施”。据随第七舰队活动的美国记者说，美国空军和海军公然在距大陆不到十二英里的地方进行巡逻。
    美国驻日本海军部队司令威辛顿25日在横须贺说，在他指挥下的舰只和人员已处于“加强的戒备状态”。另据华盛顿消息说，美国在整个远东地区的其他海军部队也已经奉命进入戒备状态，泊在日本、菲律宾和夏威夷海面的军舰可能前往加强第七舰队。
    新华社26日讯　新加坡消息：在各国人民的强烈谴责下，两周前开到新加坡进行军事挑衅活动的八艘美国军舰和约两千名海军陆战队，今天清晨全部离开新加坡。据美国驻新加坡总领事馆发表的公报说，他们将前往冲绳岛。
    据西方通讯社透露，这批美国军舰将与美国第七舰队重新会合，参与第七舰队在远东制造紧张局势的军事活动。据离开新加坡的美国海军陆战队中的人员透露，这批军舰和海军陆战队士兵准备参加9月初美国第七舰队在台湾南部枋寮同蒋介石集团海军举行的军事演习。
    据西方通讯社报道，最先在25日离开新加坡的是美国舰队的补给舰“阿路德腊号”。随后在26日清晨和黎明陆续离开的是另外七艘军舰，它们把美国的海军陆战队全部运走。
