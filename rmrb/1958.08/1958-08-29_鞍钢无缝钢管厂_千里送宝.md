Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant
Sends Treasure a Thousand Miles

Anshan, August 28th (reporter Lou Baoheng) - The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's Seamless Steel Tube Plant, highly displaying the communist spirit of selflessness and cooperation, recently dismantled two sets of small rolling mills they had personally manufactured from the production site to support fraternal enterprises in the southwest region. They also proposed to overcome all difficulties and complete the leap forward plan of increasing production by 87% compared to last year's actual output, despite the reduction in machinery and equipment.

The collective spirit of these Seamless Steel Tube Plant workers, who take the overall interest into consideration, has been warmly praised by the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel and the vast number of workers. Yuan Zhen, the manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, even wrote a letter of commendation to the workers and composed a poem: "The rolling mill is a beloved treasure, we look at it left and right, it is really good. To support others, you said you would offer treasure, and you offered treasure. This is truly a high communist style."

These two sets of small rolling mills, named "Red Flag No. 1" and "Red Flag No. 2," each with an annual output of 30,000 tons of seamless steel tubes, were made by the workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant during the Great Leap Forward, through more than a month of intense labor day and night, using waste materials. These two sets of machines can not only roll out more than 10,000 tons of steel tubes this year, but also, because the steel tubes they roll are smaller in specification, the plant's original large rolling mills can be used exclusively to roll larger specification steel tubes, increasing production by more than 10,000 tons. In this situation, the workers confidently proposed a new leap forward plan to increase production by another 20,000 tons on top of the original leap forward plan.

At the beginning of August, just as these two sets of small rolling mills were installed and about to exert their production power, the higher authorities asked them to support fraternal enterprises in the southwest. They felt that this was the glory of the entire plant, but some people were a little reluctant to send away the machines they had made with their own hands, especially worried about affecting the completion of the leap forward plan. However, after heated discussions, the workers unanimously agreed that in the past, all parts of the country had supported the construction of their plant, and now they should also fully support other regions, and expressed their determination to overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment and ensure the completion of the original leap forward plan. Then, they happily spent more than a week digging these two sets of machines out of the concrete foundation and sending them to Yunnan and Sichuan. At the same time, they also decided to send workers to help with installation and impart technology. (Attached picture)

　　鞍钢无缝钢管厂
    千里送宝
    本报鞍山28日电　记者楼葆蘅报道：鞍钢无缝钢管厂职工高度发扬舍己为人的共产主义协作精神，最近把亲手制造的两套小型轧管机从生产现场拆下来，支援西南地区的兄弟企业，并且提出要克服一切困难，在机器设备减少的情况下，还要完成原订的比去年实际产量增产87％的跃进计划。
    无缝钢管厂职工这种顾全整体利益的集体主义精神，受到鞍钢领导和广大职工的热烈赞扬。鞍钢经理袁振还特地给职工们写了一封表扬信和题了一首诗：“轧管机是心爱宝，左看右看实在好，为支援别人说献宝你就献宝，这真是共产主义风格高。”
    这两套命名为“红旗一号”“红旗二号”、每套年产量达三万吨无缝钢管的小型轧管机，是无缝钢管厂职工在大跃进中经过一个多月日日夜夜紧张的劳动，利用废旧材料制成的。这两组机器不仅本身今年能轧出一万多吨钢管，而且由于它轧制的钢管规格较小，可以使这个厂原有的大型轧管机专门用来轧制规格较大的钢管，产量可增加一万多吨。在这种情况下，职工们就满怀信心地提出了比原有的跃进计划再增产两万吨的新的跃进计划。
    8月初，正当这两套小型轧管机安装完毕，就要发挥生产威力的时候，上级要他们支援西南兄弟企业。他们感到这是全厂职工的光荣，但是也有些人对送走自己亲手制造的机器有点恋恋不舍，特别是耽心影响跃进计划的完成。但经过热烈的讨论后，职工们一致认为过去全国各地支援过他们厂的建设，现在也应该全力支援其他地区，并表示决心克服设备不足的困难，保证完成原订的跃进计划。接着，他们就愉快地用一个多星期的时间把这两套机器从混凝土基础里刨出来，送到云南、四川去，同时还决定派工人去帮助安装和传授技术。（附图片）
