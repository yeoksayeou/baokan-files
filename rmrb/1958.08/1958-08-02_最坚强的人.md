    "The Strongest People"
    The short film "The Strongest People," produced by the August First Film Studio, documents the performances and activities of the extracurricular performance team of the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Sanatorium in the capital. It is a film of great educational significance. From it, we can see that these are the strongest people. Although their limbs were injured in defending the motherland and fighting for peace, their hearts are still as hot as fire and not disabled in the slightest. Their strong revolutionary optimism inspires people's enthusiasm in socialist construction. (Yuan Xin)

    “最坚强的人”
    八一电影制片厂摄制的短片“最坚强的人”，纪录了四川革命残废军人教养院课余演出队在首都的演出和活动情况，是一部很有教育意义的影片。从中我们可以看出：这些人是最坚强的人。他们的体肢虽然为了保卫祖国、争取和平而受了伤，但他们的心却仍然像火一般热，丝毫没有残废。他们强烈的革命乐观主义精神，鼓舞了人们在社会主义建设中的干劲。（袁心）
