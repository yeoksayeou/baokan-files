Xinhua News Agency Report: The U.S. government's lie that the entry of U.S. warships and Marines into Singapore is a "routine visit" has been exposed again today.

Billings, the assistant naval attaché at the U.S. Consulate General in Singapore, said on the 22nd that the rumors that U.S. warships were about to leave Singapore were untrue. He pointed out that no date had been set for the departure of U.S. warships from Singapore. He also said that the air conditioning equipment shipped to Singapore by U.S. aircraft was still being installed.

Not only that, but the United States continues to send reinforcements to Singapore. As "support troops," a U.S. Seventh Fleet oil tanker and a supply ship arrived in Singapore on the 23rd. Prior to this, six warships and two thousand Marines from the Seventh Fleet had invaded and occupied Singapore.

Local people in Singapore are very uneasy about the entry of U.S. warships and troops into Singapore. Some Singaporean legislators believe that the entry of U.S. troops into Singapore shows that the United States has turned Singapore into a military base for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

It is reported that inquiries about the "visit" of U.S. troops have been submitted to the next meeting of the Singapore Legislative Assembly. Independent legislator Lim Zi Qin will question Minister of State David: "What is the purpose of this warship visit?" "Are there any atomic warheads and atomic missiles stored in Singapore?" Has David "estimated public opinion on Singapore as a base for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization?"

Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: Brussels dispatch: According to a telegram from London published in "Le Soir," it confirms that the landing of the U.S. Marines in Singapore is not, as U.S. President Eisenhower said, "for rest," but rather a premeditated conspiracy to create tension in the Far East.

The message quoted British experts as confirming that the U.S. action has clear military objectives. They pointed out that so far the United States does not have a permanent naval presence in the Indian Ocean. Thus, between the entire Pacific sea surface under the responsibility of the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the sea surface from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf under the responsibility of the Sixth Fleet, the Indian Ocean is a blank spot. They believe that this "blank spot" has now been "filled recently in accordance with the revision of the U.S. Marine Corps' global strategic plan." This is just like the American "vacuum theory."

These experts also confirmed that these U.S. warships "will be permanently stationed in the region."

### “通常访问”居然需要支援部队  又有两艘美舰到达新加坡  英国专家透露美军决定常驻印度洋

　　“通常访问”居然需要支援部队
    又有两艘美舰到达新加坡
    英国专家透露美军决定常驻印度洋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国政府竭力把美国军舰和海军陆战队开进新加坡说成“通常访问”的谎言，今天又被拆穿了。
    美国驻新加坡总领事馆的助理海军武官比林斯22日说，关于美国军舰即将离开新加坡的传说是不确实的。他指出，并没有确定美国军舰离开新加坡的日期。他还说，美国飞机运到新加坡去的冷气设备还在安装中。
    不仅如此，美国并且继续派遣增援舰船到新加坡去。作为“支援部队”的美国第七舰队的一艘运油船和一艘供应舰23日开到了新加坡。在这以前，已有第七舰队的六艘军舰和两千名海军陆战队侵驻新加坡。
    新加坡当地人士对美国军舰和军队开入新加坡这件事感到很大不安。一些新加坡立法议员认为，美军开入新加坡说明美国已经把新加坡变成了东南亚军事集团的一个军事基地。
    据报道，关于美国军队的“来访”的质询已经向新加坡立法议会下一次会议提出。无党派议员林子勤将质询政务部长戴维：“这次军舰来访的目的是什么？”“新加坡是否存放有原子弹头和原子导弹？”戴维“有没有估计过公众对于新加坡作为东南亚条约组织基地一事的意见？”
    新华社22日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：据“晚报”刊载来自伦敦的电讯证实，美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆并不是如美国总统艾森豪威尔所说，“是为了休息而去的”，而是有着处心积虑的在远东制造紧张局势的阴谋。
    消息引英国专家的话证实，美国的这一行动有其明显的军事目的。他们指出，到目前为止美国还没有海军常驻印度洋。这样，在美国第七舰队负责的整个太平洋海面和第六舰队负责的从地中海到波斯湾海面之间，印度洋是一个空白点。他们认为，现在这一“空白点”显然已经“依据美国海军陆战队全球战略计划的修改，而在最近填补起来了”。这同美国的所谓“真空论”，真是如出一辙。
    这些专家们还证实，这些美国军舰“将常驻该地区”。
