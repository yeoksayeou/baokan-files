Philosophy is the Key to Liberating Thought and Increasing Production
Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC Holds Symposium on Workers Studying Philosophy
Comrade Kang Sheng said that workers study theory in order to find ways to solve problems in production. This means starting from the reality of production, then studying theory, liberating thought, and then returning to production to develop production. This is a basic method of studying Marxism.
This newspaper reports that on August 3rd, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC convened a symposium of more than twenty people, including workers studying philosophy from twelve factories such as Renli Woolen Mill and Tianjin No. 1 Food Processing Factory, the district committee secretaries of the CPC’s Xinhua and Nankai districts in Tianjin, and cadres leading theoretical study. Leading comrades from the Tianjin Municipal Committee, the Hebei Provincial Committee, and Comrade Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC, also attended the symposium.
Since the People’s Daily published the news of workers studying philosophy at the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard on June 5th, under the leadership of the municipal party committee and the factory party committees, philosophy study classes have been organized in various factories in Tianjin one after another. In less than two months, the number of participants has reached more than 12,000. Starting from practical problems in production, taking the solution of practical problems as the center, and using Chairman Mao’s "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as weapons, they have gained methods for solving problems, in order to achieve the goals of liberating thought and increasing production. In the process of learning, the factory party committee secretaries, factory directors, and others first serve as teachers, giving popular explanations, and launching discussions. Remarkable results have been achieved in a short period of time. Workers who participated in the symposium introduced their gains in studying philosophy.
Li Changmao, director of the coarse spinning workshop of Renli Woolen Mill and an old worker, focused on introducing their experience in combining production with the study of philosophy and using philosophical weapons to analyze and solve specific contradictions at the meeting. He said: Why do we study philosophy? The main reason is that after implementing "two participations and one reform" (workers participate in management, cadres participate in labor, reform of production technology and rules and regulations), power has been decentralized, and we are eager to manage the factory well, but the problems are very complex and we lack methods. We are determined to study philosophy in order to solve problems and increase production. After studying, we understand many principles, our minds are enlightened, and we have more methods.
To solve contradictions, one must not avoid them
He said that two workers in our workshop's wool blending group were not united, so I simply transferred them both away, hoping to solve the problem. As a result, not only was the problem not solved, but the opinions became even greater. After studying philosophy, I realized that having opinions means having contradictions, which is an objective reality and should be specifically analyzed and specifically resolved. So I separately learned about the situation, talked to them individually, and held a group meeting, and everyone had a "unity—criticism—unity," and the problem was solved.
Grasped the focus of the contradiction
In the technical revolution, old workers Ren Hongru, Song Wenbin, and Li Shimin of the coarse spinning management and maintenance team studied the relationship between the objective and the subjective, understood the importance of correctly understanding the objective situation and better exerting subjective initiative, and led the team workers to break the conservative thinking of emphasizing objective difficulties and boldly modified the No. 2 carding machine, increasing the production of wool webs from 17.5 meters per minute, which had been the case for eight years, to 33.5 meters per minute. During the modification of the No. 2 carding machine, the machine stopped due to the damage of some parts. They used the principles of finding contradictions, analyzing contradictions, and solving contradictions, carefully checked the parts, found the cause of the stoppage, improved the machine, and increased production. They happily said: "This is solving the contradiction between people and machines." After the machine was improved, some weaving workers complained to them, saying, "You modified the machine in a few hours, and we will have to work harder in the future." They believed that this was a contradiction between people, a contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and it must be resolved. So they used the mass line method, launched a great debate, debated the purpose of production, and persuaded the weaving workers.
One cannot grasp the beard and eyebrows all at once
Liu Jingying, chairman of the trade union in the dyeing and finishing workshop of Renli Woolen Mill, focused on introducing how studying philosophy has made her clear on how to grasp different major contradictions in different periods and overcome weak links in production. Using dialectics as a weapon, she reviewed the production situation in the past few months. She said that our workshop's fine tweed section was the most backward in April, so we seized this link, mobilized the masses, and launched a high tide of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, completing the task eleven days ahead of schedule. In May, the main key turned to the coarse tweed section, and we concentrated our efforts to organize a competition, and the problem was solved again. In June, the task of inserting the head was heavy. On the one hand, we mobilized the masses to improve operations; on the other hand, we helped new workers improve their skills, and we also successfully completed the task. After studying philosophy, I realized that when solving problems, one cannot "grasp the beard and eyebrows all at once," but must be good at grasping the main contradictions, that is, grasping the key. In this way, a series of other secondary contradictions will be solved along with it. This is mastering the law of the development of contradictions.
Study philosophy and find the correct way to solve problems
Next, Wei Changgeng, an old worker with 37 years of experience at the No. 1 Food Processing Factory, introduced the situation of workers studying philosophy in their factory. His speech clearly showed that workers study philosophy for production, not for philosophy itself. He said that when workers in their factory study philosophy, they put forward topics based on problems in production practice, and everyone uses philosophical weapons to carry out specific analysis and find solutions, solving many key production problems. For example, when the factory launched a technical innovation movement, it studied the manufacturing of a water-washing egg-candling combined machine, which required technical workers, but the factory could not spare technical workers to conduct research and experiments. After the workers studied the method of changing the barrel to a non-welded method, it could save 50 technicians. After testing, it was found that some barrels leaked after using this method, and some did not leak. They specifically analyzed the reasons for not leaking, found solutions, and successfully developed a water-washing egg-candling combined machine. Now five units have been produced, saving more than 200 workers. They are further changing the face of the factory, from a food processing factory to a manufacturing factory that also produces food processing machinery. They are now manufacturing dozens of lathes to meet the urgent needs of technical innovation.
Use the law of balance and imbalance to mobilize the masses to overcome imbalance
Ge Fengshan, director of the workshop of Renli Woolen Mill, said when introducing his experience in studying philosophy that after studying philosophy, he understood the principle that balance is relative and imbalance is absolute. Therefore, he often uses this principle to mobilize the masses to solve new imbalances in production. For example, in early June, the production task was 800 meters short of completion, and the factory assigned a task to increase production by more than 4,220 meters in June. Later, he and the workers studied together, and everyone came up with many ways. The situation improved in mid-June, and the task was overfulfilled by the end of the month. In July, the task was increased again, and the task was also overfulfilled. Everyone was very motivated, and the speed of the loom was increased. At this time, the weft yarn could not be supplied in time, causing the machine to stop. They promptly discussed with the masses and took measures to speed up the speed of the weft yarn machine. At this time, the situation of not being able to use the weft yarn appeared again, creating a new imbalance. They took measures again to solve this contradiction. Because they constantly solved new contradictions, production continued to increase.
Teach philosophy in connection with reality
Bai Chongren, a cadre from the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC who came from a worker background, introduced his experience in teaching workers: first, from practice to theory, analyzing and explaining philosophical principles from specific problems in production and life; second, using workers' language to explain philosophical principles; third, guiding workers to connect with reality and improve production purposefully; fourth, closely integrating the current movement with the workers' ideological situation.
Xu Ting, deputy secretary of the Xinhua District Committee of the CPC, introduced the experience of the district committee's party school at the symposium.
Finally, Comrade Kang Sheng spoke. He said that everyone has broken superstitions and broken the mysterious view of philosophy. Workers studying Marxism and studying philosophy can easily grasp the spiritual essence. Li Changmao said that studying philosophy is inseparable from "two participations and one reform," which is completely correct.
"Two participations and one reform," in philosophical terms, is a matter of liberating and improving productive forces and improving production relations. Workers participating in enterprise management, cadres participating in labor, and reforming production technology and rules and regulations are all for the purpose of reforming the production management system and improving the relationship between people in production; and for the issue of carrying out technical innovation and improving productive forces. Therefore, it is completely correct to say that "two participations and one reform" is related to philosophy. This issue should not only be studied by workers, but also by people who specialize in philosophy, such as university professors. This is a practical issue and also a theoretical issue.
Comrade Kang Sheng believes that the experience introduced by old worker Wei Changgeng, of proposing topics around key production issues and then letting everyone use philosophy as a weapon for analysis, is very good. They study theory in order to find ways to solve problems in production. This means starting from the reality of production, then studying theory, liberating thought, and then returning to production to develop production. This is a basic method of studying Marxism. Comrade Kang Sheng gave great encouragement and praise to the speeches of several workers such as Ge Fengshan and Liu Jingying, as well as Bai Chongren's introduction to teaching philosophy.
Comrade Kang Sheng emphasized that everyone has done a great cultural revolution and technical revolution, which is not simply a matter of studying philosophy. It is both learning and revolution, both improving thought and improving production. Workers studying philosophy is a cultural revolution, and at the same time, it is closely related to the technical revolution. This point becomes clearer the closer you get to the grassroots and the masses. Comrade Kang Sheng also gave instructions on how the party committee should strengthen its leadership over workers studying philosophy, the district committee's party school, and other issues.

    哲学是解放思想提高生产的钥匙
    中共天津市委召开工人学哲学座谈会
    康生同志说，工人学理论是为了找办法解决生产上的问题，这就是从生产实际出发，经过学习理论，解放思想，然后又回到生产中去，发展生产。这是学习马克思主义的一个基本方法。
    本报讯　中共天津市委在8月3日，召集仁立毛呢厂、天津第一食品加工厂等十二个厂的学习哲学的工人，中共天津市新华、南开两区的区委书记和领导理论学习的干部共二十多人，举行学哲学的座谈会。天津市委、河北省委领导同志，中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志也参加了这次座谈会。
    自6月5日人民日报发表了上海求新造船厂工人学习哲学的消息后，在市委和工厂党委领导下，天津各厂先后组织哲学学习班，不到两个月，参加学习人数已达一万二千余人。他们从生产中的实际问题出发，以解决实际问题为中心以毛主席“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”为武器，取得解决问题的方法，以达到解放思想、提高生产的目的。在学习过程中，首先由工厂党委书记、厂长等担任教师，进行通俗的讲解，并展开鸣放、讨论。在短期内就收到立竿见影的效果。参加座谈的工人们，介绍了他们学习哲学的收获。
    仁立毛呢厂粗纺车间主任、老工人李长茂在会上着重介绍了他们结合生产学习哲学和运用哲学武器分析、解决具体矛盾的体会。他说：我们为什么要学哲学呢？主要是实行“两参一改”（工人参加管理、干部参加劳动、改革生产技术和规章制度）后，权力下放，我们恨不得把工厂管好，但是问题很复杂，缺少办法。我们决心学哲学，就是为了解决问题，提高生产。学了以后，懂得了很多道理，脑子开窍了，办法多了。
    要解决矛盾，不能避开矛盾
    他说，我们车间合毛小组有两个工人不团结，我干脆就把他们俩调开了，原想解决问题，结果不但没解决，意见更大了。学哲学后，知道有意见就是有矛盾，这是客观存在，应该具体分析具体解决。于是我分别了解了情况，找他们个别谈话，又开了小组会，大家来了一个“团结—批评—团结”，问题就解决了。
    抓住了矛盾的焦点
    在技术革命中粗纺管理保全小组老工人任鸿儒、宋文彬和李世民等学习了客观和主观的关系，懂得了正确认识客观情况，更好地发挥主观能动性的作用，带动小组工人打破强调客观困难的保守思想，大胆改装二号梳毛机，使毛网的生产由八年来一直是每分钟十七点五公尺，提高到三十三点五公尺。在改装二号梳毛机的过程中，曾因部分机件损坏而造成停车，他们运用了找矛盾，分析矛盾和解决矛盾的道理，仔细检查了机件，发现停车原因，改进了机器，提高了生产。他们高兴地说：“这就是解决了人和机器的矛盾。”机器改进后，有个别挡车工埋怨他们说：“你们几个钟头就把机器改装了，往后我们可得多干活了。”他们认为这是人与人的矛盾、先进与落后的矛盾，必须解决。于是又运用群众路线的办法，展开了大鸣大放，辩论了生产目的性问题，说服了挡车工。
    不能胡子眉毛一把抓
    仁立毛呢厂染整车间工会主席刘景英着重介绍了她学习哲学后，使她明确了如何在不同时期抓住不同的主要矛盾，克服生产当中的薄弱环节。她运用辩证法作武器，回顾了过去几个月的生产情况。她说，我们车间4月份补细呢工段最落后，我们就抓住这个环节，发动群众，掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进的高潮，提前十一天完成了任务，5月份主要关键转到了补粗呢工段，我们又集中力量，组织竞赛，问题又解决了。6月份插头部任务大，我们一方面发动群众改进操作；另一方面帮助新工人提高技术，也顺利地完成了任务。学了哲学后，我才体会到，在解决问题时，不能“胡子眉毛一把抓”，要善于抓住主要矛盾，也就是抓住关键。这样，其他一系列次要矛盾就都随着解决了，这就是掌握矛盾的发展规律。
    学哲学，找到解决问题的正确方法
    接着，第一食品加工厂有三十七年工龄的老工人魏长庚介绍他们工厂工人学哲学的情况。他的发言鲜明地说明了工人们是为了生产而学哲学、不是为了哲学而学哲学。他说，他们工厂工人学哲学时根据生产实践中的问题提出课题，由大家运用哲学武器进行具体分析，找出解决办法，解决了许多生产关键问题。例如工厂在开展技术革新运动时，研究制造水洗照蛋联合机，需要技术工人，但是工厂抽不出技术工人来研究试验，经过职工们研究将桶改为不烧焊的办法，可以节约出五十名技工。经过试验，发现用这种办法以后有的桶漏，有的不漏。他们就具体分析不漏的原因，找出解决办法，研究成功了水洗照蛋联合机，现在已制出五台，节约了二百多人的劳动力。他们正进一步改变工厂面貌，由食品加工厂改为兼制食品加工机器的制造厂，现在制造几十台车床，以应技术革新的急需。
    运用平衡与不平衡的规律发动群众克服不平衡
    仁立毛呢厂车间主任戈风山在介绍他学哲学的体会时说，他学了哲学，懂得了平衡是相对的，不平衡是绝对的道理以后，经常运用这个原理，发动群众解决生产中新的不平衡。例如6月上旬生产任务差八百公尺没有完成，工厂又布置了6月份再增产四千二百二十多公尺的任务。后来，他和工人一起研究，大家想出很多办法，中旬情况就好转，到月底超额完成了任务。7月份又增加了任务，也超额完成了任务。大家干劲很足，织机加快了转数。这时纬纱不能及时供应，造成停车现象，他们便及时同群众商量，采取了措施，加快了纬纱机的转数。这时又出现纬纱用不了的情况，造成新的不平衡，他们又采取了措施，解决了这个矛盾。由于他们不断解决新的矛盾，就使生产不断提高。
    联系实际教哲学
    中共天津市委宣传部工人出身的干部白崇仁介绍了他给工人讲课的经验：第一是从实际到理论，从生产和生活的具体问题中分析讲解哲学道理；第二用工人的语言来解释哲学上的原理；第三，有目的地引导工人去联系实际，提高生产；第四，密切结合当前运动和工人的思想情况。
    中共新华区委员会副书记续挺在座谈会上介绍了区委办党校的经验。
    最后康生同志讲话。他说，大家已经打破了迷信，打破了对于哲学的神秘观点。工人学习马克思主义，学习哲学，很容易掌握住精神实质。李长茂讲学哲学与“两参一改”分不开，这是完全正确的。
  “两参一改”，用哲学的话讲，就是解放、提高生产力，改善生产关系的问题。工人参加企业管理，干部参加劳动，改革生产技术与规章制度，都是为了改革生产管理制度，改善生产中人与人的关系；搞技术革新，提高生产力的问题。所以说“两参一改”与哲学有关，是完全对的。这个问题不但工人要研究，专门搞哲学工作的人，大学教授也要研究。这是实际问题，也是理论问题。
    康生同志认为老工人魏长庚介绍的围绕生产关键提出课题，然后让大家用哲学作武器进行分析的经验非常好。他们学理论是为了找办法解决生产上的问题。这就是从生产实际出发，经过学习理论，解放思想，然后又回到生产中去，发展生产。这是学习马克思主义的一个基本方法。康生同志对戈风山、刘景英等几个工人的发言以及白崇仁教哲学的经验介绍，都给予很大的鼓励和赞扬。
    康生同志强调指出：大家干了一件伟大的文化革命和技术革命，不简单是学哲学的问题。又是学习，又是革命，又是提高思想，又是提高生产。工人学哲学是文化革命，同时它本身又和技术革命密切联系着，这一点越到基层越到群众中看得越清楚。康生同志对党委如何加强对工人学习哲学的领导、区委办党校等问题也都作了指示。（附图片）
