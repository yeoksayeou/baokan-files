　　Visiting Qasim
　　Yang Shuo
　　In every great event in human history, some outstanding figures emerge. Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim is one who has soared from this revolution. We came here originally to pay our respects to him. I was pondering in my mind: What kind of person is Qasim exactly? I was eager to meet him. Unexpectedly, on the very night we arrived in Baghdad, Habib, the chairman of the Iraqi Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee (who is also the Minister of Finance), said to us: "The Prime Minister invites you to dinner."
　　We were led to the Officers' Club. It was a spacious garden, with soft, lovely green grass, and countless small red lights adorning the unnamed trees around it. Some cool chairs were scattered on the green grass, with people sitting in several circles.
　　A soldier stood up to greet us. This man was about forty-five years old, wearing an extremely ordinary khaki military uniform, with a pistol hanging on his left waist. His temples were already gray, his eyebrows were very heavy, he had a small mustache on his upper lip, and his eyes were like an eagle's, emitting a sharp light. From his overall demeanor, he appeared serious yet approachable, capable yet simple and unpretentious. At first glance, one could tell he was a man who had been through many battles.
　　This was naturally Prime Minister Qasim. Qasim was relatively silent. Once he sat down, he just flashed his eyes, listened very attentively to other people's conversations with a smile. When talking about the Iraqi revolution, he seemed a little excited and said in a clear tone: "The imperialists always dream of holding the entire earth in their palms, to be slaughtered at will, never expecting that the Iraqi revolution would be like a thunderbolt, directly striking their heads." After saying this, he stood up and led us to dinner.
　　The dining table was set up in the open air in a corner of the garden, covered with various dishes, including two famous Iraqi dishes: one was roast whole lamb, and the other was called "Mosguf," which is a large fish smoked in a special way. The fish was fresh and tender, very delicious. I asked Habib, "What is this fish called? I have never seen it before."
　　Habib said, "It's called Kordan, which comes from the Tigris River." As he spoke, he pointed forward with a fork.
　　Only then did I realize that the garden was adjacent to the famous Tigris River. The river surface was dark and oily, with the occasional splash, perhaps the Kordan fish, a specialty, were jumping in the water.
　　Prime Minister Qasim asked me, "Is Baghdad too hot for you to bear?"
　　I smiled and said, "But my heart is hotter than the weather."
　　Habib then told Qasim that the Chinese people's demonstrations of support for Iraq were like countless flames, burning all over China. Qasim revealed a moved expression and said, "The Iraqi people will always stand with you. China was the first to recognize Iraq in our time of crisis, and we will never forget it."
　　I proposed to have a special talk with him, and Qasim readily asked, "When? Tomorrow?"
　　However, the program for the next day did not include a meeting with him. The day after that, at a banquet, Qasim appeared unexpectedly again, still as simple and straightforward as ever. As soon as our appointment was mentioned, he said without hesitation, "Okay, it will be tomorrow." It is said that whatever he does, it is always tomorrow, he never procrastinates.
　　The next day at noon, I arrived at the Ministry of Defense according to the appointment. This is where Qasim works. From the environment of his life, I felt an extremely friendly atmosphere. Every officer or soldier, as soon as they heard that I was from the People's China, looked at me with a smile, indescribably warmly. As soon as I sat down, a person leaned over my shoulder and said directly how much he wanted to see China, and asked me for a picture of Chairman Mao. Don't think this is a young child, in fact, it is Qasim's colonel adjutant, named Tahir, burly and thick-waisted, with black hair all over his arms, holding a submachine gun, which easily reminds people of Xu Chu in the Three Kingdoms. He, however, leaned over your ear like an innocent child, chattering about wanting a picture of Chairman Mao.
　　After a while, Colonel Tahir led me into Qasim's office. This room was just as simple as its owner, without even a carpet, but with shelves full of military books. After Qasim had the guests sit down, he wanted to send us photos and personally signed them. Colonel Tahir leaned over my shoulder again from behind the chair and said loudly: "You don't know, until now, he still keeps the marching bed in the army and lives like a soldier, and he wants to maintain this kind of life to the end."
　　Qasim raised his head, slightly closed his left eye, glared at Tahir. Tahir then whispered in my ear, "It's true, he just doesn't like people talking about it. He has been in the army all these years, only thinking about the country, and he hasn't even gotten married yet."
　　From Tahir's affectionate tone when talking about him, I understood that the people in the army loved their Prime Minister. Many friends said that every day there is an endless stream of people rushing to Baghdad from all directions to pay their respects to Qasim, which shows that the people also love him. What outstanding contributions has he made to the country and the people? Let's listen to his conversation.
　　Qasim sat upright in a wooden chair, pondered for a while, then looked up, his eyes flashing sharply, and said slowly in a calm and powerful tone:
　　"I came from a military background, and the revolutionary path I have taken has been relatively tortuous. As early as 1934, when I was a young man, before graduating from the military academy, I felt resentment towards the British colonial rule. At that time, some like-minded people held several meetings and sent several threatening letters to those agents of imperialism, asking them to act in accordance with the interests of the nation. This was of course useless. After I graduated, I saw the state affairs getting worse and worse, and I had the will to continue the struggle in my heart. In 1954, I began to contact everyone in the army who had conscience and courage, asking for cooperation. I used to be an instructor at the military academy, and most of the officers who participated in this revolution were my students, so it is not surprising.
　　"In 1956, I was appointed as the commander of the Iraqi army stationed in Jordan, but when I realized that this was a conspiracy against an Arab neighbor, I tried my best to prevent that dirty conspiracy from being realized.
　　"One people's uprising after another prompted me to decide to overthrow the corrupt Faisal dynasty, so I organized secret 'Free Officers' cells everywhere in the army. I started to prepare for action. At first, I wanted to use assassination to get rid of Nuri al-Said and Iraq. But what good would assassination do? We must use revolutionary actions as swift as thunder to seize the entire state machine at once."
　　Speaking of the last few words, Qasim frowned, slowly pinched his five fingers of his left hand together, and then forcefully opened them again, emphasizing his tone. Then he thought deeply and said:
　　"This requires relying on the broad masses of the people. We constantly contact the huge power of the people. When the military and the people are connected together, they form an irresistible revolutionary torrent.
　　"Of course, to achieve true victory, we must also consider all aspects of factors, especially military deployments and tactics. Past combat experience helped me. I arranged a secret plan, and the basis for the victory of this plan was built on absolute secrecy and surprise action. We hid this dangerous secret, and didn't even let our best friends know the news, until that moment, when the people fully cooperated with us and launched the revolution."
　　As he spoke, Qasim raised his right palm and chopped down, truly like cutting through tangled hemp with a sharp knife, and with this one blow, the utterly corrupt Faisal dynasty was uprooted.
　　At the end of the conversation, when parting, Qasim shook my hand, a smile on the corner of his mouth, and said, "Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support. Please give my regards: I sincerely pay my respects to the Chinese people." (Attached picture)

　　访卡塞姆
　　杨朔
    在人类历史的每一次大事件里，总有些杰出的人物涌出来。伊拉克总理卡塞姆就是从这次革命中飞出来的。我们此来，原定要向他致敬。我心里盘算着：卡塞姆究竟是怎样个人物呢？急着想见他。不想一到巴格达的当天夜晚，伊拉克的亚非团结委员会主席哈比伯（也是财政部长）就对我们说：“总理请你们去吃饭呢。”
    我们被引到军官俱乐部去。满宽敞的一座花园，草地软绵绵的，绿得可爱，四周叫不出名的树上装点着无数小红灯。绿草地上散摆着一些凉椅子，围坐着好几圈人。
    一位军人迎着我们站起来。这人约摸四十五岁，穿着一身极其平常的黄咔叽布军装，左腰挂着枝手枪。他的两鬓已经花白了，眉毛极重，上唇留着一撮小胡子，两只眼睛像鹰似的，射出锐利的光芒。从他整个的神气说来，显得严肃而又透着和气，精干而又朴素平易，一看就知道是个久经战斗的人。
    这自然是卡塞姆总理。卡塞姆为人比较沉默，一坐下来，只是闪着两只眼，带着微笑，十分注意地听着别人的谈话。谈到伊拉克革命时，他显得有点兴奋，用明快的口气说：“帝国主义总是妄想把整个地球都握在掌心里，可以任意宰割，料想不到伊拉克的革命会像个迅雷，直劈到他们的头上。”说完便站起身，领我们去吃饭。
    餐台露天摆在花园的一角，上面布满各种菜肴，里边有两色伊拉克的名菜：一色是烤全羊，另一色叫“莫丝古”，是用一种特殊方法熏烤的大鱼。鱼肉又鲜又嫩，十分可口。我问哈比伯道：“这叫什么鱼？我从来还没见过。”
    哈比伯说：“叫科丹，就是底格里斯河出的。”说着用叉子朝前一指。
    这时我才发觉花园紧临着有名的底格里斯河。河面黑油油的，不时泼剌一声，泼剌一声，也许正是特产的科丹鱼在跳水呢。
    卡塞姆总理问我道：“巴格达这样热，你受得住么？”
    我笑道：“可是我的心比天气还热呢。”
    哈比伯就告诉卡塞姆，中国人民支持伊拉克的示威游行，像无数把烈火似的，烧遍全中国。卡塞姆露出感动的神色说：“伊拉克人民永远和你们站在一起。中国在我们危急的时候，首先承认伊拉克，我们永远也不会忘记。”
    我提出愿意跟他特别谈一次，卡塞姆爽利地问：“什么时候？明天么？”
    可是第二天的节目并没安排我去见他。隔一天，在一次宴会上，卡塞姆又意想不到地出现，还是那样简单爽快。一提起我们的约会，他不加思索说：“好，就是明天。”听人说，他无论做什么，总是明天，不肯拖延。
    第二天中午，我按照约会来到国防部，这是卡塞姆办公的地方。从他生活的周围，我感到一种极其友好的气氛。每个军官或者士兵，一听说我是从人民中国来的，都望着我笑，说不出的亲热。我刚坐下，有个人俯到我肩上，直说他多么想看看中国，又向我要毛主席的照片。你别以为这是个年轻孩子，其实是卡塞姆的上校武官，叫塔黑尔，膀大腰粗，两条胳臂上满是黑毛，握着枝手提机枪，很容易使人联想起三国里的许褚。他却像个天真的孩子似的俯在你耳朵上絮絮叨叨要毛主席的照片。
    不一会，塔黑尔上校领我走进卡塞姆的办公室。这间屋子恰好像它的主人一样简单，连块地毯都没有，倒有满架子军事书籍。卡塞姆让客人坐定后，要送我们照片，便亲自往照片上签字。塔黑尔上校又从椅子后俯到我的肩上，大声谈论说：“你不知道，直到现在，他还保留着军队里的行军床，过着像士兵一样的生活，而且要保持这种生活到底。”
    卡塞姆抬起头，微微闭着左眼，瞪了塔黑尔一下。塔黑尔便咬着我的耳朵悄悄说：“本来是真的嘛，还不喜欢人讲。这些年他一直在军队里，心里只惦记着国家，到今天也没结婚。”
    从塔黑尔谈论他时的那种亲昵口气，我懂得军队中人是爱他们的总理的。许多朋友都说，每天都有川流不息的人群从四面八方赶到巴格达来向卡塞姆致敬，可见人民也是爱他的。他究竟对国家和人民做了什么出色的贡献？且听听他的谈话。
    卡塞姆笔直地坐在一张木头椅子上，沉思一会，然后仰起脸，眼睛闪着锐利的光芒，语气沉着而有力，慢慢说道：
    “我是军人出身，我所走的革命道路比较曲折。早在1934年，我还是个青年，从军官学校毕业以前，就对英国的殖民统治感到愤恨。当时有些志同道合的人，开过几次会，给那些帝国主义的代理人发出好几封恐吓信，叫他们按照民族的利益办事。这当然无用。我毕业以后，看看国事越变越坏，心里便产生了继续斗争的意志。1954年，我开始和军队里每个有良心和勇气的人接触，要求合作。我曾经在军官学校当过教官，参加这次革命的大部分军官都是我的学生，也就不足为奇了。
    “1956年，我被委任做伊拉克驻约旦大军的司令官，但是当我发觉这是反对一个阿拉伯邻邦的阴谋，就极力设法使那个肮脏的阴谋不能实现。
    “一次又一次的人民大起义促使我决定推翻那个腐烂的费萨尔王朝，于是便在军队里到处组织起‘自由军官’秘密细胞。动手做准备工作了。起初想用暗杀手段去掉努里·赛义德和伊拉。暗杀又有什么好结果呢？必须用迅雷不及掩耳的革命行动，把整个国家机器一下子夺过来。”
    说到最后几句话，卡塞姆绉起眉头，左手五根指头慢慢捏拢，又使力张开，加重他的语气。接着他又深思着说：
      “这就必须依靠广大的人民。我们不断和人民的巨大力量发生联系。军民联系一起，便形成一种不可抵抗的革命洪流。
    “当然，要想取得真正的胜利，还得考虑到各方面的因素，特别是军事调动和战术。以往的战斗经验帮助了我。我布置好一个秘密计划，这个计划的胜利基础建筑在绝对秘密和突然行动上。我们隐藏着这个危险的秘密，连最好的朋友也不让他知道消息，直到那一刻，人民和我们充分合作，发动了革命。”
    说着，卡塞姆举起右掌，向下一劈，真是快刀斩烂麻，就在这一击之下，腐烂透顶的费萨尔王朝连根铲除了。
    谈话结束，临别的时候，卡塞姆握着我的手，嘴角浮着微笑说：“从心里感谢你们的支持啊。请代我致意：我诚心诚意向中国人民致敬。”（附图片）
