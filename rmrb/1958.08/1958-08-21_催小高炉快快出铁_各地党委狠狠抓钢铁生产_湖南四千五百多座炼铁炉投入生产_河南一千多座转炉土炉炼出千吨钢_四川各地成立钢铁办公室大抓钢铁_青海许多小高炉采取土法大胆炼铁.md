    Party Committees Everywhere Vigorously Grasp Steel Production
    Over 4,500 Iron Smelting Furnaces in Hunan Put into Production
    Over 1,000 Converters and Indigenous Furnaces in Henan Smelted 1,000 Tons of Steel
    Sichuan Establishes Steel Offices Everywhere to Vigorously Grasp Steel Production
    Many Small Blast Furnaces in Qinghai Boldly Smelt Iron Using Indigenous Methods
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the New Hunan Daily: The revolutionary movement of the whole Party and all the people running the iron and steel industry is increasingly forming a high tide in Hunan Province. According to statistics from six special districts and autonomous prefectures, as of mid-July, 14,936 iron smelting furnaces have been built (including 34 small and short blast furnaces), and 4,588 have been put into production (including 7 small blast furnaces built and put into production in the first half of the year; plus the original 21 small blast furnaces, the total is 4,609), producing more than 80,000 tons of iron (including the original enterprises). In terms of steelmaking, according to incomplete statistics, more than 50 units and places in the province have successfully experimented, and some units' steelmaking furnaces have been officially put into production, producing 7,843.5 tons of steel.
    Now, all regions have proposed taking steel as the key to drive the great development of local industry, mobilizing the whole Party and all the people to vigorously run the iron and steel industry. Party secretaries of prefectures, counties, and townships personally take charge, and designate Party committee members to specifically manage the iron and steel industry, grasp key points, create experience, and guide the overall situation. At the same time, they rationally arrange labor and organize a strong team to engage in the iron and steel industry.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 20th (Reporter Lu Xiaoping): A large number of newly built indigenous blast furnaces and steelmaking furnaces in Henan Province have been put into production, causing iron streams to flow and steel flowers to bloom everywhere in the province. By August 15th, more than 14,300 indigenous blast furnaces and simple small blast furnaces combining indigenous and foreign methods have been built in the province. Almost every township and commune in areas with iron ore resources has iron smelting furnaces. The 1,200 newly built steelmaking converters and indigenous furnaces in various places have already smelted 1,011 tons of steel. Before January, the entire province could not smelt even half a ton of steel.
    Judging from the situation in various places, the reason why furnaces can be put into production as soon as they are built is primarily because these places ensured the quality of furnace construction. Many counties trained technical forces for furnace construction through various methods to ensure that the construction quality of the furnaces met design standards. Secondly, these places paid attention to organizing the supply of equipment and raw materials while building the furnaces.
    When the newly built furnaces in various places were first put into production, some experienced phenomena such as settling and slag-iron separation. After the local Party committees of the Communist Party of China discovered this, they immediately convened on-site meetings for analysis and research, and took a series of measures according to different situations to ensure the normal production of the furnaces.
    Tens of thousands of small blast furnaces and steelmaking furnaces of various types are still under construction in Henan Province. Now, the local Party committees of the Communist Party of China are grasping construction and production simultaneously. Mechanical factories throughout the province are rushing to manufacture steel smelting equipment and striving to have most of this equipment leave the factory by the end of August.
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Sichuan Daily: The movement of 10,000 indigenous blast furnaces in Sichuan Province is entering a climax, with more than 300 indigenous blast furnaces put into production in half a month.
    At the end of July, after the local, municipal, and county committees made specific studies based on the provincial party committee's instructions on developing pig iron, a high tide of secretaries taking charge, the whole party mobilizing, and all the people engaging in iron has formed. More than tens of thousands of people in each special area are invested in steel production and construction. According to incomplete statistics on August 15, more than 800 have been built in the province, of which more than 300 have been put into production.
    In the movement to build indigenous blast furnaces, new creations continue to emerge. Jiulong Township in Gulin County used mud and lime water to build an indigenous blast furnace, and it only took 21 hours from building the furnace to producing iron. Following this, the party branch secretary and several commune members of Jiaoping Township in the county used a mortar (stone mortar) as the furnace hearth, and it only took eight hours from building the furnace to producing iron, producing nearly 500 jin of iron a day.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the province's iron and steel industry, the Steel Office of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee was established in early August. Subsequently, the steel offices of the local party committees have also been established one after another. In the early morning of August 16, the Steel Office of the Provincial Party Committee convened a telephone conference with the heads of the steel offices of the local party committees, listened to the reports from various places, and instructed that the large-scale construction of indigenous blast furnaces should adopt the method of running at all levels (county, district, township, commune), by various departments, and by various factories and mines to form a wider mass movement.
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Qinghai Daily: All prefectures, cities, and counties in Qinghai Province have comprehensively launched a blitz movement to build indigenous blast furnaces.
    Recently, the Provincial Party Committee convened an industrial planning conference, requesting a rapid upsurge in the new high tide of the Great Leap Forward in industry, striving for high speed, taking the iron and steel and machinery marshals as the center, driving the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry, and resolutely reversing the situation of insufficient industrial leap.
    According to preliminary statistics from some counties and cities, nearly a thousand indigenous blast furnaces have been built in the province recently, and some of them have already smelted iron. The blitz battle to build indigenous blast furnaces in Datong County has been fully launched from the county to the township to the agricultural cooperative. Among the nearly 50 indigenous blast furnaces that have been built, the masses have boldly tried smelting using indigenous methods. Some have already produced molten iron. Currently, 1,000 people in the county are busy smelting and mining every day.

    催小高炉快快出铁
　　各地党委狠狠抓钢铁生产
    湖南四千五百多座炼铁炉投入生产
    河南一千多座转炉土炉炼出千吨钢
    四川各地成立钢铁办公室大抓钢铁
    青海许多小高炉采取土法大胆炼铁
    本报讯  新湖南报消息：全党全民大办钢铁工业的革命运动正在湖南省范围内日益形成高潮。据六个专区和自治州的统计，截至7月中旬止，已建成炼铁炉一万四千九百三十六座（其中小高炉、矮高炉三十四座），投入生产的四千五百八十八座（其中包括上半年已建成并投入生产的小高炉七座；加上原有小高炉二十一座，则为四千六百零九座），生产了铁八万多吨（包括原有企业）。在炼钢方面，据不完全统计，全省已有五十多个单位和地方试验成功，部分单位炼钢炉正式投入了生产，已出钢七千八百四十三点五吨。
    现在，各地区都提出了以钢铁为纲带动地方工业大发展，发动全党全民大办钢铁工业。地、县、乡党委书记都亲自挂帅，并指定党委委员专管钢铁工业，掌握重点，创造经验，指导全面。同时合理安排劳动力，组织了搞钢铁工业的强大队伍。
    据新华社郑州20日电  新华社记者陆笑萍报道：河南省大批新建土高炉和炼钢炉投入生产，使全省到处铁水奔流，钢花怒放。到8月15日止，全省已经建成土高炉和土洋结合的简易小高炉一万四千三百多座，在有铁矿资源的地方差不多乡乡社社都有了炼铁炉；各地刚建成的一千二百多座炼钢转炉和土炉，已经炼出钢一千零十一吨，而在一月以前全省连半吨钢也不能冶炼。
    从各地情况看来，凡是炉子一建起来就能投入生产的地方，首先是因为这些地方保证了建炉质量。不少县为了使炉子的建设质量合乎设计标准，曾通过各种办法训练了建炉技术力量。其次是因为这些地方在建炉的同时，注意组织设备和原材料的供应。
    各地新建的炉子在刚投入生产的时候，有的发生坐底和渣铁不分的现象。中共各地党委发现后，立即召开现场会议进行分析研究，并且分别各种不同情况采取了一系列措施，以保证炉子进行正常生产。
    河南省还有几万座各种类型的小高炉和炼钢炉正在建设。现在中共各地党委正在一手建设，一手抓生产。全省机械厂正在赶制钢铁冶炼设备，并且争取在8月底使这些设备大部出厂。
    本报讯  四川日报消息：四川全省万座土高炉运动正进入高潮，半个月内已有三百多座土高炉投入生产。
    7月底，各地、市、县委根据省委关于发展生铁的指示具体作了研究以后，书记挂帅、全党动员、全民动手搞铁的高潮已经形成。各专区投入钢铁生产建设的都在数万人以上。据8月15日的不完全统计，全省已建成的有八百多座，其中有三百多座投入了生产。
  在建土高炉运动中，新的创造不断出现。古蔺九龙乡用泥巴加?水建成土高炉，从建炉到出铁前后只二十一小时；接着，该县椒坪乡党总支书记和几个社员又利用对窝（石臼）作炉缸，从建炉到出铁，总共只花了八个钟头，一天出铁近五百斤。
    为了加强对全省钢铁工业的领导，8月初，中共四川省委成立了钢铁办公室。随着，各地委的钢铁办公室也已相继建立。8月16日清晨，省委钢铁办公室召集各地委钢铁办公室负责人开电话会议，听取了各地的汇报，并指示大办土高炉，应采取各级办（县、区、乡、社）、各部门办、各厂矿办的办法，形成一个更为广泛的群众性运动。
    本报讯  青海日报消息：青海省各州、市、县全面展开了大建土高炉的突击运动。
    最近省委召开了工业计划会议，要求迅速掀起工业大跃进的新高潮，力争高速度，以钢铁和机械元帅为中心，带动工业全面大跃进，坚决扭转工业跃进不够的局面。
    据部分县市的初步统计，最近该省已建成近千座土高炉，其中一部分已经炼出了铁。大通县大建土高炉的突击战，从县到乡直至农业社已全面展开，在已经建成的近五十座土高炉中，群众采取土法大胆试炼，有的已流出铁水，现全县每天有一千人在紧张的冶炼和采矿。
