Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 14th: The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways jointly convened a National Water-Land Transportation Conference here from the 5th to the 12th. Representatives from railway bureaus, port bureaus, maritime transport bureaus, and shipping bureaus across the country attended the conference. The conference enhanced everyone's understanding of communist collaboration and resolved several common and important problems existing in water-land transportation, namely: transportation balance, transshipment handover, pre- and confirmed reporting, and rules and regulations. The resolution of these problems will greatly strengthen the cooperative relationship of national water-land transportation and enable the transportation industry to further play a pioneering role in national construction.

The meeting held that the communist collaboration style has greatly overwhelmed the departmentalism style, and there are few or no people who openly oppose collaboration; however, in actual work, various forms of departmentalism are still seriously hindering the smooth development of joint transportation work. For example, some stations are afraid that there will not be enough port workers and vehicles will be piled up. When notifying the port to send vehicles, they would rather be early than late and rather more than less; while the port is afraid that the station's plan is inaccurate, and when allocating workers, they also tend to be rather late than early and rather less than more. Some ports do not consider actual needs and possible conditions, and blindly require the station to submit arrival vehicle forecasts too early; some stations do not give full consideration to the cargo location and cargo type in the port, and one-sidedly require more unloading, and so on.

After inspecting and criticizing these departmentalism ideas that do not conform to the spirit of communist collaboration, representatives from various places requested to increase joint transportation, open inland river joint transportation, and requested to do more, do it faster, and do it well. Representatives from both the railway and the port played an active role and put forward many specific methods to actively organize balance, expand the scope of cooperation, and support each other.

In order to effectively carry out joint transportation business, the meeting also believed that it is necessary to closely rely on the leadership of the Party, constantly inspect and criticize departmentalism, and mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in technical revolution and cultural revolution, improve transportation efficiency, and accelerate cargo turnover to meet the requirements of the current great leap forward in my country's production and construction.

### 全国水陆联运会议批判本位主义思想　组织水陆联运大协作

　　全国水陆联运会议批判本位主义思想
　　组织水陆联运大协作
    据新华社青岛14日电　交通部和铁道部5日到12日在这里联合召开了全国水陆联运会议，出席会议的有全国各地铁路局、港务局、海运局和航运局的代表。会议提高了大家对共产主义协作的认识，解决了水陆联运中存在的几个带有普遍性的重要问题，即：运输平衡问题，换装交接问题，预、确报问题，规章制度问题。这些问题的解决，将使全国水陆联运的协作关系大大加强，使交通运输事业在国家建设中进一步发挥先行作用。
    会议认为，目前共产主义协作之风大大压倒了本位主义之风，公开反对协作的人是很少或者是没有了；但在实际工作中，形形色色的本位主义思想仍然严重地妨碍着联运工作的顺利开展。例如，有的车站怕港方工人不足而积压车辆，在通知港方送车时，便是宁早勿晚，宁多勿少；而港方则怕站方计划不准，在配备工人时也多采取宁晚勿早、宁少勿多的办法，也有的港不考虑实际需要与可能条件，一味要求车站过早提出到达车预报；部分车站对港内货位与货种不作周全考虑，片面地要求多卸车，等等。
    与会代表检查和批评了这些不符合共产主义协作精神的本位主义思想以后，各地代表纷纷要求增加联运，开办内河联运，要求多办、快办、办好。路港双方代表都发挥了主动性，提出了很多积极组织平衡、扩大协作面、互相支援的具体办法。
    为了有效地开展联运业务，会议还认为必须紧紧依靠党的领导，不断检查和批判本位主义思想；发动群众大闹技术革命和文化革命，提高运输效率，加快货源周转，以适应当前我国生产建设大跃进的要求。
