Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 6th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today, expressing "regret and surprise" at the continued landing of troops and tanks by U.S. imperialists in Lebanon. The statement pointed out that this action by the United States "can only be seen as preparing conditions for further aggression against the Arab people."

The statement said: "Although every act of this aggression has caused the Arab people to hate U.S. imperialists, U.S. imperialists still blindly insist on their foolish actions."

The statement continued, the events in the Arab world should have shown the Western imperialists that the Arab people's liberation struggle is an irresistible trend. The old era of colonialism and exploiters is gone forever, and any attempt to violate the trend of history and drag the Arab world back to the old days will endanger peace and is doomed to failure.

The statement said that the landing of U.S. and British troops in Jordan and Lebanon is intended to suppress the freedom of the people of these countries, thereby supporting reactionary elements at the end of their rope. This action threatens peace in the region and grossly violates the United Nations Charter.

The Secretariat warned the U.S. and British imperialists to stop this blind action and called on the Asian and African people to take on the cause of safeguarding peace and freedom.

The statement requested the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of various countries to hold mass rallies in major cities on the day of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting, demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from Lebanon and British troops withdraw from Jordan, and to telegraph the resolutions demanding troop withdrawal passed at the rallies to U.S. President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 6th: Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem held a banquet on the evening of the 5th to entertain the delegation from the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, which was visiting. Most ministers and senior officials of the Iraqi government attended the banquet.

The delegation arrived in Baghdad on the morning of the same day. The members of the delegation are: Yang Shuo, the Chinese secretary of the Secretariat, Afiz from the United Arab Republic, Afana, the secretary from Cameroon, and Abdullah from French Somaliland. The purpose of the delegation's visit is to pay tribute to the people and government of the Republic of Iraq on behalf of the people of Asian and African countries, to congratulate them on the victory of the Iraqi revolution, and to strengthen the deep friendship and solidarity between the Iraqi people and the Asian and African people through the delegation's visit.

    亚非团结理事会号召齐声抗议侵略行为
    发起要求美英撤兵日
    建议各国重要城市在联大开会当天开群众大会
    新华社开罗6日电  亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，对美帝国主义者继续派遣军队和坦克在黎巴嫩登陆表示“遗憾和惊讶”。声明指出，美国的这种行动“只能看作是为对阿拉伯人民进行进一步的侵略准备条件”。
    声明说：“虽然这种侵略的每一个行动都使美帝国主义者遭到阿拉伯人民的痛恨，可是美帝国主义者还是要盲目地坚持他们愚蠢的行动。”
    声明接着说，阿拉伯世界所发生的事件应该已经向西方帝国主义者表明，阿拉伯人民的解放斗争是一种不可抗拒的趋势。殖民主义和剥削者的旧时代已经一去不复返了，任何想要违反历史的趋势把阿拉伯世界拉回往日局面的企图都将危及和平，并且注定要失败。
    声明说，美英军队在约旦和黎巴嫩登陆，是打算压制这些国家人民的自由，从而支持日暮途穷的反动分子。这种行动威胁着这个地区的和平，并且粗暴地违反了联合国宪章。
    书记处警告美英帝国主义者，要它们停止这种盲目的行动，并且呼吁亚非人民担负起维护和平与自由的事业。
    声明要求各国的亚非团结委员会在即将到来的举行联合国大会会议的那一天，在重要城市举行群众集会，要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队撤出约旦，并且把集会上通过的要求撤兵的决议打电报通知美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    新华社巴格达6日电  伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在5日晚上举行宴会，招待前来访问的亚非人民团结理事会书记处代表团。伊拉克政府大多数部长和高级官员都参加了宴会。
    代表团是在当天上午到达巴格达的。代表团成员为：书记处的中国书记杨朔、阿拉伯联合共和国的阿菲兹、喀麦隆书记阿法纳和法属索马利兰的阿卜杜拉。代表团访问的目的是代表亚非各国人民向伊拉克共和国人民和政府致敬，祝贺伊拉克革命的胜利，并且通过代表团的访问来加强伊拉克人民和亚非人民之间的深厚友好团结关系。
