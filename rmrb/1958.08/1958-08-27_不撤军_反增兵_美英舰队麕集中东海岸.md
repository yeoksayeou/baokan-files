　　No Troop Withdrawal, Instead Troop Increase
    US and British Fleets Mass Off Middle East Coast
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 26th: Tass, Beirut, 25th: Fifteen warships of the US Sixth Fleet were anchored off the coast of Lebanon on the 24th. It is reported that the US warships arrived here after "exercises" in the eastern Mediterranean.
    US fleet transport ships have recently been unloading various building materials at an accelerated pace. It is reported that the US military command intends to obtain the Lebanese government's consent to establish US military bases in Lebanon.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th: Following the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session, demanding that the US and Britain withdraw their invading troops from the Near and Middle East as soon as possible, British naval officials shockingly announced on the 25th that Britain would continue to send more ships to the Near and Middle East. Four escort frigates (three from Izmir, Turkey, and one from Cyprus) passed through the Suez Canal last week to the Persian Gulf to reinforce the British naval forces there. Naval officials said that since the Iraqi revolution on July 14, British forces in Aden and the Persian Gulf region have greatly increased.
    British naval officials also did not conceal the provocative purpose of this British action towards the United Arab Republic. They said that these four British escort frigates could have gone to the Persian Gulf via the Cape of Good Hope, but they decided to go through the Suez Canal and visited Port Said. The purpose of this action was to let the United Arab Republic "take a look at these ships."

　　不撤军  反增兵
    美英舰队麕集中东海岸
    据新华社26日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特25日讯：美国第六舰队的十五艘军舰24日在黎巴嫩岸边下碇。据报道，美国军舰是在地中海东部“演习”后开到这里来的。
    美国舰队的运输舰近来正在加速度卸下各种建筑材料。据报道，美军司令部打算取得黎巴嫩政府同意，在黎巴嫩建立美国军事基地。
    新华社26日讯　伦敦消息：在联合国大会紧急特别会议通过决议，要求美英两国早日从中近东地区撤退它们的侵略军队以后，英国海军人士25日竟然宣布，英国继续向中近东地区增派舰只，四艘护航快舰（三艘来自土耳其的伊兹密尔、一艘来自塞浦路斯）上星期已通过苏伊士运河到波斯湾去，增援那里的英国海军部队。海军人士说，自从7月14日伊拉克革命以来，英国在亚丁和波斯湾地区的部队已经大大增加。
    英国海军人士也不掩饰英国这一行动对阿拉伯联合共和国的挑衅目的。他们说，英国这四艘护航快舰本来可以绕道好望角到波斯湾去，但是它们决定取道苏伊士运河，并且访问了塞得港，这个行动的目的是要让阿拉伯联合共和国“瞧瞧这些舰只”。
