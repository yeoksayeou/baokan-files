　　The Root of the Trouble Must Be Removed
　　By Our Staff Commentator

　　Will the American and British aggressors abide by the resolution of the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly and withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible? This is a matter of greatest concern to the people of all countries.

　　The facts of the past few days show that after being forced to accept the resolution on troop withdrawal, the American and British aggressors are trying every possible means to delay the implementation of this resolution, and are even continuing to carry out new aggression and military provocations. After the American invading forces surrounded the Basta district controlled by the insurgent people of Beirut on the 25th, they not only ignored the insurgents' warnings and refused to withdraw from the occupied positions, but on the contrary, they issued war threats to the insurgent people. In a statement to reporters on the 27th, Adams, the commander of the American invading forces in Lebanon, openly said that his troops had received orders to conduct a "sufficient" "retaliation" when they were subjected to "hostile attacks." In other words, the American invading forces are prepared to open fire on the insurgents in the Basta district. At the same time, the American invading forces continue to rent houses inside and outside Beirut, preparing to occupy the area for a long time. As for the British aggressors, they sent four more warships to the Middle East after the UN General Assembly's Emergency Special Session. A British Foreign Office spokesman even said on the 26th that it was "too early" to predict the date of Britain's withdrawal from Jordan.

　　The actions of the American and British aggressors are clearly a sabotage and violation of the resolution of the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In particular, the American invading forces' war threats to the Beirut insurgents have created new tensions in Lebanon. After the American invading forces stepped up their military provocations, battles have occurred in Beirut for two consecutive days. Adams's frantic cries foreshadow an extremely dangerous situation. This situation cannot but arouse the serious vigilance and great indignation of the people of all countries.

　　The original purpose of the American and British aggressors in occupying Lebanon and Jordan was to prepare to expand their aggression. However, their acts of aggression have been resolutely opposed by peace-loving people all over the world, and have been severely condemned by the vast majority of member states at the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly. Under the circumstances of being watched by all and condemned by all, the aggressors had no choice but to accept the resolution on troop withdrawal, but they did not give up their aggressive ambitions. The American invading forces' military provocations and war threats against the Lebanese insurgents after the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly are intended to create incidents to further expand their aggression. Here, the American aggressors have completely exposed their ferocious faces: not only do they want to occupy Lebanese territory for a long time, but they are also prepared to slaughter the insurgent people of Lebanon in order to achieve this goal. Britain's claim that it does not intend to withdraw its troops from Jordan early, and its sending of more warships to the Middle East, are clearly attempts to take the opportunity to continue to act fiercely against the people of the Middle East.

　　It is very clear that the resolution of the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly has not automatically eased the situation in the Middle East; as long as the American and British invading forces continue to remain in Lebanon and Jordan, they will try to find excuses and opportunities to expand their aggressive actions and exacerbate the existing tensions. For the sake of peace in the Middle East and the world, the people of all countries must step up their struggle to remove the root of the tense situation in the Middle East and force the American and British aggressors to abide by the resolution of the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly and withdraw their troops from the Middle East as soon as possible. The Middle Eastern people will not have peaceful days, and the world will not have lasting peace, until the American and British troops withdraw.

　　必须拔除祸根
　　本报评论员
    美英侵略者是不是遵守联合国大会紧急特别会议的决议，早日把它们的军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出呢？这是当前各国人民最为关切的问题。
    这几天来的事实显示，美英侵略者在被迫接受了关于撤军的决议后，正在千方百计地拖延执行这个决议，甚至还在不断进行新的侵略和军事挑衅。美国侵略军队在25日包围了贝鲁特起义人民所控制的巴斯塔区之后，不但不顾起义者的警告，拒绝从侵占的阵地上撤出，相反的，还对起义人民发出战争威胁的叫嚣。侵黎美军司令亚当斯在27日对新闻记者发表的声明中，就公然说他的军队已经得到命令，在遭到“敌意攻击”时就要进行“足量”的“回击”。换句话说，美国侵略军队已准备向巴斯塔区的起义者开火。与此同时，美国侵略军队继续在贝鲁特市内外租用房屋，准备长期盘踞下去。至于，英国侵略者在联大紧急特别会议后，又向中东增派了四艘军舰。英国外交部发言人更在26日说，现在要预言英国撤出约旦的日期还“为时过早”。
    美英侵略者的所作所为，显然是对联大紧急特别会议决议的破坏和违反。特别是美国侵略军队对贝鲁特起义者的战争威胁，又在黎巴嫩造成了新的紧张局势。在美国侵略军队加紧进行军事挑衅行动以后，贝鲁特已连接两天发生了战事。亚当斯的疯狂叫嚷，更预示着一种极端危险的局势。这种情况不能不引起各国人民的严重警惕和极大的愤慨。
    美英侵略者侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的目的，原是准备扩大侵略的。但是，它们的侵略行为遭到了全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对，并在联大紧急特别会议上受到绝大多数会员国家的严正斥责。侵略者在十目所视、十手所指的情况下，不能不接受撤军的决议，但是它们并没有放弃它们的侵略野心。美国侵略军队在联大紧急特别会议后对黎巴嫩起义者进行军事挑衅和施加战争威胁，其目的是要制造事端，来进一步扩大侵略。在这里，美国侵略者彻底暴露了它的凶恶嘴脸：它不但要长期侵占黎巴嫩的土地，而且为了达到这一目的还准备屠杀黎巴嫩的起义人民。英国扬言不打算早日从约旦撤军，并向中东增派军舰，显然也是企图伺机向中东人民继续逞凶。
    事情很明白，联大紧急特别会议的决议并没有自动使中东局势得到缓和；美英侵略军队只要继续留在黎巴嫩和约旦，它们就会设法寻找借口和机会来扩大它们的侵略行动，加剧已有的紧张局势。为了中东和全世界的和平，各国人民还要加紧斗争，来拔除中东紧张局势的祸根，迫使美英侵略者遵守联大紧急特别会议的决议，早日把它们的军队从中东撤出。美英军队一天不撤退，中东人民一天就不会有安宁的日子，世界也不会有巩固的和平。
