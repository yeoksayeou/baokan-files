　　Anti-Drought Folk Songs
　　Draining all the water in the world, each drop of water, each drop of sweat, water droplets must be exchanged for sweat; vigorously drain all the water in the world, even if sweat can float a ship. Water the rice paddies until they are full, a great drought in the Crystal Palace. (Yinma River)

　　The riverbed is dry and facing the sky, water is filled bucket after bucket, carrying thousands upon thousands of loads; in an instant, the riverbed is dry and facing the sky, carrying away the river water to irrigate the fertile fields. (Niu Yunxiang)

　　Rice seedlings grow to the sky, the anti-drought army has a firm will, digging until the rocks emit green smoke; hot sweat draws out dry well water, watering the rice seedlings to grow to the sky. (Hu Yonglong)

　　The carrying pole is soft and smooth, a carrying pole that is soft and smooth, carrying clear water to walk in the fields; rice seedlings love my clear water, I love the green rice seedlings.

　　抗旱民歌
    掏尽天下水一颗水珠一滴汗，水珠要用汗珠换；用力掏尽天下水，哪怕汗水漂起舰。车得稻田水汪汪，水晶宫里闹大旱。（饮马河）
    河干底朝天桶里装水满又满，挑了千担又万担；霎时河干底朝天，挑走河水灌良田。　（牛云祥）
    禾苗长上天抗旱大军意志坚，刨得岩石冒青烟；热汗引出干井水，浇得禾苗长上天。（胡永龙）
    扁担软溜溜一条扁担软溜溜，担上清水田里走；禾苗爱我清清水，我爱禾苗绿油油。
