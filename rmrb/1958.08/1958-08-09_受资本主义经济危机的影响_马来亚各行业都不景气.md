Xinhua News Agency, August 6th, Kuala Lumpur dispatch: A recent report released by the Ministry of Labor of the Federation of Malaya states that from last November to the end of June this year, the total number of unemployed tin miners in Malaya has exceeded 10,000. The report says that people expected the measures taken by the International Tin Council to reduce the export volume of tin-producing countries would improve the tin price situation, but this expectation has not been realized.

The report also points out that in Malaya, the industries affected by the capitalist world economic crisis have gone beyond the scope of the tin industry, and almost all industries have been affected. Some stores have also taken measures to lay off employees and have to adopt methods such as discounted sales and free home delivery to attract customers. In the industrial sector, shortening working hours and reducing wages have become a common phenomenon. The report also says that credit is very tight in the market. Under the influence of the downturn, only the pawn industry is "doing well."

According to newspaper reports, the International Tin Council recently announced that it would further reduce the export volume of tin-producing countries in the fourth quarter of this year. The total export volume of the six tin-producing countries will be reduced from 23,000 tons to 20,000 tons. This news shocked and dissatisfied people in the tin industry in Malaya. People in Malaya are anxious and uneasy about the further increase in the number of tin mines forced to close and the number of unemployed miners in the future.

    受资本主义经济危机的影响
    马来亚各行业都不景气
    新华社6日讯  吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦劳工部最近发表一项报告书说，从去年11月到今年6月底止，马来亚失业的锡矿工人总数已经超过一万人。报告书说，人们期待国际锡业理事会削减锡产国输出量的措施会使锡价情况改善，但是，这个期望一直没有实现。
    报告书还指出，在马来亚，受资本主义世界经济危机影响的行业已经超出了锡业的范围，差不多所有行业都已经波及，一些商店也已经采取裁员的措施，并且还得采取折价出售和免费送货上门等办法来吸引顾客。在产业部门中，缩短工作时间和减少工资已经成为普遍的现象。报告书还说，市面上银根很紧。在不景气的影响下，只有典当业“一枝独秀”。
    据报纸报道，国际锡业理事会最近又宣布了要在今年第四季度进一步削减锡产国输出量。六个锡产国的总输出量将要从二万三千吨削减到二万吨。这个消息使得马来亚的锡业界人士深感震惊和不满。马来亚人士对于今后被迫停闭的锡矿场和失业的矿工人数都将进一步增加一事，感到焦虑和不安。
