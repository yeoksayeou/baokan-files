Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: The Northern Region Agricultural Irrigation Work Conference, convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, which opened in Baoding City, Hebei Province, and closed in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, lasting twenty-seven days and covering thousands of miles, concluded on July 16th. The conference, adopting a method of combining meetings with visits, traveled through Hebei, Anhui, and Henan provinces, visiting the irrigation construction in nine counties including Xushui, Anguo, Suxian, Suixi, Fugou, Yanling, Jiaxian, Yuxian, and Changge. It exchanged the rich experiences of various provinces in different regions in building agricultural irrigation, controlling floods, conserving water and soil, and transforming waterlogged areas. Finally, the conference put forward a bold goal: to work hard for a year from this autumn to next "May Day," and strive to realize irrigation in the northern region ahead of schedule, ensuring a bumper harvest in agricultural production under any drought or flood conditions.
    More than 100 representatives from provinces and regions including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Beijing Municipality participated in this on-site observation conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture.

    The conference initially proposed specific targets for the northern provinces, regions, and municipalities for the year of hard work. These targets include: increasing the irrigated area so that the northern region basically realizes irrigation after a year of hard work; transforming waterlogged areas, so that all low-lying and easily flooded areas are initially managed; realizing the network of rivers and the irrigation of fields like gardens on large areas of land; and initially controlling most of the soil erosion areas. In addition, rural hydropower should be developed in the construction of irrigation, and a large number of water lifting tools should be improved.

    During the conference, Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting and gave important instructions.

    After research, the conference confirmed that the direction of irrigation construction in the future should be based on the General Line, and continue to implement the principle of focusing on small-scale projects, focusing on water storage, and focusing on self-reliance by the masses. In the future, the construction of small-scale irrigation projects should be the foundation, medium-sized projects should be the backbone, supplemented by necessary large-scale projects. Large, medium, and small-scale projects should be combined, from point to surface, from decentralized to systematic, from one township or commune to the comprehensive development of small and medium-sized river basins, combined with the management of small and medium-sized river basins, vigorously developing rural hydropower, shipping, and aquaculture. Efforts should be made to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters within one or two years, and comprehensively complete irrigation.

    The conference pointed out that river networking is the main direction for the further development of irrigation construction in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River, Yellow River, Hai River, and Liao River plains, low-lying areas, and saline-alkali land, and is the most complete method to eradicate drought and flood disasters in these areas. All regions should formulate plans according to local conditions and actively carry them out. In mountainous and hilly areas, a self-flowing irrigation system combining diversion, storage, irrigation, and drainage should be gradually formed. While building agricultural irrigation, irrigation techniques should be actively improved, the experience of mountain spray irrigation and the irrigation of fields like gardens should be promoted, and mass irrigation experiments and research should be vigorously carried out. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Gansu and other regions, pastoral irrigation should also be actively developed, striving to solve the problem of drinking water for livestock first, and gradually developing the irrigation of pastures and feed bases.

    The conference summarized the unprecedented great achievements of irrigation construction in the northern region in the past year. In the past year, the northern region completed more than 36 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work in irrigation construction, expanded the irrigated area by 290 million mu, transformed 120 million mu of waterlogged areas, and initially controlled soil erosion in an area of 168,000 square kilometers. The irrigated area in the northern region has jumped from 19% of the cultivated land area in 1957 to 49%, which has fundamentally changed the natural landscape and agricultural production landscape in many places. In Hebei Province, it had not rained thoroughly for nearly 300 days from September last year to July this year. Due to the improvement of drought resistance by irrigation construction, this year's summer harvest increased by more than 66% compared to last year. Henan Province supplied a total of 4 billion cubic meters of water for winter and spring irrigation of wheat, 3.5 billion cubic meters more than in previous years, resulting in an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest this year. Since the beginning of summer, many projects have initially withstood the test of floods, with generally good quality and significant benefits.

    The conference believed that through this on-site visit, models for governance were found from mountainous areas to hills to plains to low-lying areas. The experience of Xushui County in simultaneously utilizing surface water and groundwater, with two sets of irrigation facilities providing double insurance; the experience of Anguo County in "land as flat as a mirror, furrows as straight as lines," irrigating and cultivating fields like gardens; the experience of Suxian and Suixi counties in river networking; and the experience of Changge County in well and spring irrigation, tool reform, and deep plowing of land are all worthy of learning.

    The conference pointed out that although the northern region has made great achievements in irrigation construction, it has only taken a big step in water control work. More than half of the cultivated land in the northern region has not yet been irrigated, and three-quarters of the areas with severe soil erosion have not yet been treated; the projects that have been built generally have low standards and cannot resist major drought and flood disasters. As for the Northeast and Northwest, they are even worse. The key to realizing irrigation nationwide lies in the North. Therefore, the task of the North is much greater than that of the South. For this reason, the northern provinces, regions, and municipalities should launch a movement to learn from Henan and catch up with Henan to push irrigation construction to a greater climax. To launch this new climax, it is necessary to put politics in command, with secretaries taking the lead, the whole party mobilizing, and the whole people launching, criticizing complacency and the idea of "irrigation reaching the top"; and to complete the planning and preparation work before the end of September; to complete the comprehensive utilization and development plan for small and medium-sized river basins; to improve the communist cooperation between provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and communes, between upstream and downstream, left and right banks, and various departments; to rely on the masses to do a good job in preparing materials and equipment, and to widely promote and manufacture advanced tools for irrigation construction, realizing bearingization to eliminate the phenomenon of manual carrying, so as to start early and work hard for a year.

    Finally, the conference called on all localities and agricultural cooperatives to strengthen flood control and irrigation management work. During the flood season, all localities must organize special forces to protect newly built projects, and must not relax their vigilance in the slightest.

    北方地区农田水利工作会议决定
    大干一年提前实现水利化
    据新华社31日讯  在河北省保定市开幕，在河南省郑州市闭幕，历时二十七天，行程几千里的北方地区农田水利工作会议，已在7月16日结束。这次会议用一面开会一面参观的办法，经历河北、安徽、河南三省，参观了徐水、安国、宿县、濉溪、扶沟、鄢陵、郏县、禹县、长葛等九县的水利建设，交流了各省各种不同地区的兴修农田水利、治水防洪、水土保持、改造洼涝的丰富经验，最后，会议提出了豪迈的奋斗目标，要从今年秋天到明年“五一”大干一年，争取北方地区提早实现水利化，保证农业生产在任何旱涝的情况下都能丰收。
    由农业部召开的这次现场观摩会议，参加的有辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、青海、新疆、宁夏等省、区和北京市的代表一百多人。
    会议初步提出了北方各省区和市的大干一年的各项具体指标。这些指标包括：增加灌溉面积，使北方地区在大干一年之后，基本上实现水利化；改洼治涝，使全部低洼易涝区得到初步治理；实现大面积土地上的河网化和灌溉园田化；使大部分水土流失区得到初步控制。此外，还要在兴修水利中发展农村水电和大量改良提水工具。
    会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、中共中央书记处书记谭震林到会作了重要指示。
    会议经过研究，确认今后水利建设的方向，应当根据总路线，继续贯彻以小型为主、蓄水为主和群众自办为主的方针。今后要以兴修小型水利工程为基础，中型为骨干，辅以必要的大型。大、中、小型相结合，由点到面，由分散到系统，由一乡一社到中小河流域的综合开发，结合中小河流域治理，大力发展农村水电、航运和水产事业。争取在一两年内，基本消灭水旱灾害，全面完成水利化。
    会议指出，河网化是淮河、黄河、海河、辽河中下游平原、洼地、盐碱地水利建设进一步发展的主要方向，是根除这些地区水旱灾害的最完善的方法。各地应当因地制宜地制定规划，积极进行。在山区和丘陵区要逐步形成一个引、蓄、灌、排相结合的自流灌溉系统。在兴修农田水利的同时，积极改进灌溉技术，推广山地喷灌和灌溉园田化的经验，并大力进行群众性的灌溉试验研究工作。在内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、青海、甘肃等地区还应积极发展牧区水利，争取首先解决牲畜饮水问题，并逐步发展草场和饲料基地的灌溉。
    会议总结了过去一年北方地区水利建设的史无前例的巨大成绩。过去一年，北方地区兴修水利共作土石方在三百六十亿公方以上，扩大灌溉面积二亿九千万亩，改洼治涝一亿二千万亩，水土保持初步控制面积为十六万八千平方公里。北方地区的灌溉面积已由1957年占耕地面积的19％，跃增到49％，使很多地方的自然面貌和农业生产面貌起了根本的变化。河北省从去年9月到今年7月以前，近三百天没下透雨，由于兴修水利提高了抗旱的力量，今年夏收比去年增产66％以上。河南省小麦冬灌春灌共供水四十亿公方，较往年多供水三十五亿公方，因而今年小麦空前丰收。入夏以来，不少工程已经初步经过洪水考验，质量一般良好，效益显著。
    会议认为，通过这次实地参观，从山区到丘陵到平原到洼地都找到了治理的典范。徐水县地上水与地下水利用同时并举，两套灌溉设施作到双保险的经验；安国县“地平如镜面，垅沟直如线”，灌溉耕作园田化的经验；宿县和濉溪县河网化的经验；及长葛县井泉灌溉、工具改革、深翻土地的经验等，都是值得学习的榜样。
    会议指出，北方地区水利建设虽已取得巨大成就，但仅仅是在治水工作上跨了一大步。北方地区耕地一半以上还未得到灌溉，四分之三的水土流失严重地区还没有进行治理；已修的工程，标准一般偏低，遇到较大的水旱灾害，还不能抗御。至于东北和西北还要差些。全国实现水利化的关键在于北方，因此，北方的任务要比南方大得多，为此，北方各省、区、市应掀起一个学河南、赶河南的运动，把水利建设推向更大的高潮。掀起这个新高潮，必须政治挂帅，书记带头，全党动员，全民发动，批判骄傲自满和“水利到顶”的思想；并在9月底以前就把规划和准备工作做好；把中小河流域综合利用开发规划作好；把省、专、县、乡、社之间，上下游、左右岸、各部门之间的共产主义协作搞好；依靠群众做好物资器材准备，并且大量推广、大量制造兴修水利的先进工具，实现轴承化来消灭人力挑抬的现象，以便早日动手，大干一年。
    会议最后号召各地和各农业社加强防汛和灌溉管理工作。汛期中各地必须组织专门力量保护新修工程，丝毫也不能放松警惕。
