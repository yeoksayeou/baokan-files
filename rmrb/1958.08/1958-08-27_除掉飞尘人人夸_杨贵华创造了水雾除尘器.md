　　Bold Creation, Bold Innovation

　　Getting Rid of Flying Dust, Everyone Praises
    Yang Guihua Creates Water Mist Dust Collector
　　Mineral Powder and Dust Flying Everywhere, Citizens and Masses Have Strong Opinions. Daring to Think and Daring to Act, Yang Guihua Eliminates Flying Dust, Everyone Praises.
    The workers of the sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company used this ballad to praise Yang Guihua, the creator of the water mist dust collector.
    A year ago, when Yang Guihua was first transferred to the second sintering workshop, the smoke ash and mineral powder coming out of the sintering machine filled his nose and ears. One day, Yang Guihua went to the Bai Lou Clinic for treatment and heard the doctors saying, "Since the new sintering workshop was built, we have been unlucky, and we can't even open the windows."
    Yang Guihua wanted to find a way to solve the problem at that time, but he also thought: many engineers have studied this dust removal problem in the past, but the problem has not been solved. How can I, an illiterate rough man, intervene?
    During the "Double-Anti" movement, others sent Yang Guihua a large stack of big-character posters, one of which wrote: "The dust removal problem of the sintering machine is a big watermelon, please solve it, Master..." Yang Guihua was stunned, he thought: How can I solve it?
    At this time, the Party called for carrying out the technical revolution movement. He felt that the problem of dust flying everywhere should be solved.
    One day, Yang Guihua was working on the sintering machine when suddenly a burst of water droplets floated down from above.
    "Where did this drizzle come from?" Yang Guihua said casually.
    "You are really ignorant. This is artificial rain, a cooling and dust removal device on the sintering machine."
    As soon as Yang Guihua heard this, he had an idea: if artificial rain can be used to remove dust on the sintering machine, can't the tail chimney also try it?
    "If a sprinkler is installed on the chimney, the dust can fall with the water droplets, but if the water flows down the chimney, it will affect production, which is not acceptable." Yang Guihua thought over and over again, and came up with a way that would not affect production: add a hat to the top of the sprinkler pipe, and then dig a drainage hole at the bottom to drain the dirty water, wouldn't that be fine?
    Yang Guihua plucked up the courage and made his plan public to everyone. Unexpectedly, everyone agreed with his plan, and the workshop director also supported him. The cadres sent down from the design institute also took the initiative to help him design.
    Yang Guihua's idea became a reality. On June 28, the first water mist dust collector was installed on the towering chimney. Looking at the black smoke coming out of the chimney turning into white gas, the water mist dust collector not only reduced 80% of the flying dust, but also recovered 14,000 tons of miscellaneous ore every year.

### 除掉飞尘人人夸  杨贵华创造了水雾除尘器

　　除掉飞尘人人夸
    杨贵华创造了水雾除尘器
　　矿粉灰尘满天刮市民群众意见大敢想敢干杨贵华除掉飞尘人人夸。
    鞍钢烧结总厂的工人用这首歌谣称道创造水雾除尘器的杨贵华。
    一年前，杨贵华刚调到二烧结车间的时候，烧结机里冒出来的烟灰、矿粉，把他的鼻子、耳朵都灌得满满地。一天，杨贵华到白楼门诊部去看病，听见医生们也在说：“自从有了新烧结车间，咱们就倒霉了，连窗户都不能开。”
    杨贵华当时就想设法解决，可是又想到：这个除尘问题过去不少工程师都研究过，结果仍然没有解决，我这个连字都不识的大老粗，怎么能够插得上手呢？
    双反运动中，别人给杨贵华送来了一大叠大字报，其中有一张写着：“烧结机除尘问题是个大西瓜，请哪位老师傅给解决一下……。”杨贵华就发楞了，他想：我哪能解决得了。
    就在这个时候，党号召开展技术革命运动。他觉得应该解决灰尘满天飞的问题。
    有一天，杨贵华在烧结机上工作，突然从上面飘下来阵阵水珠。
    “哪来的这阵小雨，”杨贵华随口说了一句。
    “你真是少见多怪。这是人造雨，烧结机上的降温、除尘设备。”
    杨贵华一听就计上心来：烧结机上能用人造雨除尘，机尾烟囱不也可以试试吗？
    “烟囱装上喷水器，灰尘是可以随着水珠落下来了，不过水顺着烟囱淌下来，要影响生产，这可不行。”杨贵华想来想去，想出了一个不影响生产的办法：在喷水管上边加个帽子，下边再挖个流水眼，把脏水引出去，这一来不就行了。
    杨贵华一鼓劲就把自己的打算向大伙儿公开了。没想到，他这个打算一公开，大伙儿都赞成，车间主任也支持。设计院下放干部也主动来帮助他设计。
    杨贵华的想法变成了现实，6月28日，第一个水雾除尘器安在耸立半空的大烟囱上。瞅着烟囱里冒出来的黑烟变成了白气。水雾除尘器不但减少了80％的飞尘，每年还可以回收一万四千吨杂矿。
