    Welcome Prime Minister Sihanouk

　　The state delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, headed by Prime Minister Norodom Sihanouk, will arrive in Beijing today. Our people warmly welcome the distinguished guests to our country for a friendly visit with great excitement.

　　Our people have a deep affection for the Cambodian people and the outstanding Cambodian statesman Prime Minister Sihanouk. Cambodia is a close neighbor with whom we have had friendly exchanges for more than a thousand years. We have seen that, under the active advocacy of Prime Minister Sihanouk, the Royal Cambodian Government pursues a policy of peace and neutrality in international relations; it insists on not participating in military blocs, does not allow foreign military bases to be established on Cambodian territory, and is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries. Western countries have attempted to undermine Cambodia’s policy of peace and neutrality, and have constantly instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam to invade the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia and create provocative incidents, as many as twenty-nine times this year alone. The imperialists and their servants' infringement upon Cambodia's independence and sovereignty has been rebuked and opposed by the Cambodian people and government. Cambodia's firm position in safeguarding its independence and sovereignty has won the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. Today, Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality has won the respect and support of the vast majority of the world's people and all countries that truly love peace. Cambodia is playing an increasingly important role in Asian and world affairs. Cambodia's practice powerfully proves a truth: that any country, regardless of its size, can contribute to maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation.

　　Prime Minister Sihanouk's first visit to our country in February 1956 is still fondly remembered by our people. The joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Sihanouk confirmed the Five Principles (Panchsheel) as the guiding principles for Sino-Cambodian relations. During his visit, Prime Minister Sihanouk also expressed the hope that the friendship between our two peoples, our peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for sovereignty would provide an example for all countries whose sincere wish is to survive and prosper in friendship, freedom and peace. It is encouraging that in the past two years or more, the friendly relations between our two governments and peoples have been further developed. During this period, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Cambodia. Our country has provided economic assistance to Cambodia in the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange of needed goods. Our cultural, artistic and sports groups have successively visited Cambodia. The delegation of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by Sang Nhean, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Cambodian cultural and artistic delegation headed by Princess Phavada Devi and Prince Chakrapong, the Cambodian Buddhist delegation headed by Venerable Huot Tat, President of the Cambodian Sihanouk Buddhist Institute, and many people from Cambodian news and sports circles, have visited our country successively. Recently, thanks to the initiative of Prime Minister Sihanouk, and the joint efforts of our two peoples, China and Cambodia have established normal diplomatic relations and decided to exchange ambassadors. This marks that the friendly relations between our two countries have entered a new stage.

　　This development of Sino-Cambodian friendly relations not only fully conforms to the interests of the two peoples, but also reflects the deep desire of the Asian and African peoples to strengthen friendly unity with each other in the process of striving for peace and safeguarding national independence in accordance with the Bandung spirit. Colonialists harbor extreme hostility towards this desire of the Asian and African peoples, and try their best to obstruct and sabotage it by various means. However, the people of China and Cambodia, like the vast majority of the people in the Asian region, have embarked on the road of independent development, become masters of their own destiny, and will no longer allow any force to obstruct the restoration and development of the traditional friendship between our two countries; and the tide of national independence and friendly unity emerging among the Asian people today is by no means something that the colonialists can resist.

　　We firmly believe that Prime Minister Sihanouk's visit to our country this time will greatly help the further development of friendly relations between China and Cambodia.

### 欢迎西哈努克首相

　　欢迎西哈努克首相
    以诺罗敦·西哈努克首相为首的柬埔寨王国国家代表团将在今天到达北京。我国人民以极其兴奋的心情热烈欢迎贵宾们来我国进行友好访问。
    我国人民对于柬埔寨人民和柬埔寨的杰出的政治家西哈努克首相有着亲切的感情。柬埔寨是一个同我国有着一千多年友好往来的亲密邻邦。我们看到，在西哈努克首相的积极倡导下，柬埔寨王国政府在国际关系上奉行着和平中立的政策；它坚持不参加军事集团，不允许外国在柬埔寨的领土上建立军事基地，愿意同一切国家发展友好关系。西方国家企图破坏柬埔寨的和平中立政策，曾不断唆使南越吴庭艳集团侵犯柬埔寨王国的领土、制造挑衅事件，仅今年以来已达二十九次之多。帝国主义及其仆从对柬埔寨独立和主权的侵犯，遭到了柬埔寨人民和政府的斥责和反对。柬埔寨维护自己独立和主权完整的这种坚定立场，得到了中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的同情和支持。今天，柬埔寨的和平中立政策，已经获得了世界广大人民和一切真正爱好和平的国家的尊重和支持。柬埔寨在亚洲和世界事务中正在发挥日益重要的作用。柬埔寨的实践有力地证明了一个真理，即：任何国家不论大小，都能够为维护世界和平和促进国际合作作出贡献。
    西哈努克首相在1956年2月对我国的第一次访问，至今在我国人民中还留着亲切的回忆。周恩来总理和西哈努克首相发表的联合声明确认五项原则（潘查希拉）为中柬两国关系的指导方针。西哈努克首相在访问期间并曾经表示，希望我们两国人民之间存在的友谊、我们的和平相处和互相尊重主权，将对所有真诚愿望在友好、自由、和平中生存和繁荣的各国人民提供一个榜样。令人鼓舞的是，两年多来，我们两国政府和人民的友好关系有了进一步的发展。这期间，周恩来总理访问了柬埔寨。我国根据平等互利、互通有无的精神，对柬埔寨提供了经济援助。我国文化艺术和体育团体，先后访问了柬埔寨。由柬埔寨王国议会议长桑·年率领的柬埔寨王国议会代表团、以帕花·黛维公主和夏卡朋王子为首的柬埔寨文化艺术代表团、由柬埔寨西哈努克佛学院院长胡达法师率领的柬埔寨佛教代表团和柬埔寨的许多新闻、体育界人士，曾经先后来我国访问。最近由于西哈努克首相的倡议，由于我们两国人民的共同努力，中柬两国又建立了正常的外交关系，并且决定互派大使。这就标志着我们两国的友好关系，开始进入了一个新的阶段。
    中柬友好关系的这种发展，不但完全符合两国人民的利益，而且反映了亚非各国人民在争取和平和维护民族独立的过程中，要求根据万隆精神互相加强友好团结的深切愿望。殖民主义者对于亚非人民的这种愿望抱着极端仇视的态度，并且尽量采取种种手段加以阻挠和破坏。但是，中柬两国人民同亚洲地区绝大多数人民一样，已经走上了独立发展的道路，成了自己命运的主人，将不再容许任何力量阻挠我们两国恢复和发展传统的友谊；而目前亚洲人民中间所涌现的民族独立和友好团结的浪潮，也绝不是殖民主义者所能阻挡得住的。
    我们坚信，西哈努克首相这次来我国访问，将大大有助于中柬两国友好关系的进一步发展。
