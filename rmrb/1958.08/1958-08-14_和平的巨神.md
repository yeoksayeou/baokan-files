The Giant of Peace
Bai Dongqiao

Great socialism, the giant of peace! Since the world has had you, humanity has had hope. Independence, freedom, and happiness are truly guaranteed.

Although some clowns slander you in every possible way, modern revisionists say you are a "military bloc," and imperialists constantly say they are preventing your "aggression" and "expansion." However, facts are always facts. Slander not only does not diminish your slightest dignity, but makes you even taller and greater.

A giant is always a giant, and a demon is always a demon. Any slander or disguise is useless. People all over the world can see clearly.

In the 1930s, it was imperialism that started the entire European war, and it was also imperialism that ignited the flames of war in Asia and invaded China. Later, it was imperialism that launched the Korean War, and it was also imperialism that interfered in the national liberation struggles of Vietnam and Indonesia. It is imperialism that wants to occupy the Suez Canal and enslave the Arab people for a long time, and it is also imperialism that occupies our territory of Taiwan. It is still imperialism that is arming West Germany and Japan, and building military bases around the world to prepare for war. And now, U.S. and British imperialism, defying the world's disapproval, have openly sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan. ... Look at the modern and contemporary history of the world, which international war was not caused by colonialists?

What kind of tree bears what kind of flower, the imperialist demons can only lead to war.

It is precisely in the process of stopping war that the giant of peace shows its greatness.

The forces of peace defeated Hitler's Germany, the maker of World War II, and Japan, which invaded Asia. The forces of peace extinguished the flames of war in Korea. It is also because of the forces of peace that imperialism's conspiracies in Vietnam, Indonesia, Egypt, etc., have not succeeded.

"The devil rises one foot, the Dao rises ten feet." This is the experience we have gained from fighting war maniacs. Only in this way can we stop war, and war maniacs will not dare to act recklessly. Any weakness or tolerance will bring destruction upon oneself. The Munich Conference, sacrificing Czechoslovakia, did not satisfy the greed of Hitler's Germany. China's past "giving up the Northeast" also failed to stop Japan's further aggression. This is a bloody lesson.

Grow stronger, giant of peace! People all over the world who love peace, unite! Only when the "Dao" is high can we subdue the "devil."

    和平的巨神
　　白东桥
    伟大的社会主义，和平的巨神！世界上自从有了你，人类才有了希望。独立、自由、幸福才真正有了保障。
    尽管有些小丑对你百般诬蔑，现代修正主义者说你是“军事集团”，帝国主义口口声声说防止你“侵略”，“扩张”。但是，事实总是事实，诬蔑不但没损你丝毫威严，反而使你更高更大。
    巨神总归是巨神，恶魔终究还是恶魔，任何诬蔑、装扮，都无济于事，全世界人民看得清清楚楚。
    在二十世纪三十年代，掀起整个欧洲大战的是帝国主义，在亚洲燃起战火，侵略中国的也是帝国主义。后来，发动侵朝战争的是帝国主义，干涉越南、印度尼西亚民族解放斗争的也是帝国主义。想长期霸占苏伊士运河、奴役阿拉伯人民的是帝国主义，占领我国领土台湾的也是帝国主义。武装西德、日本，在世界各地建立军事基地准备战争的仍然是帝国主义。而现在，美英帝国主义又甘冒天下之大不韪，公然出兵侵略黎巴嫩、约旦。……翻翻世界近代、现代史看看，有哪次国际间的战争不是由殖民主义者造成的？
    什么树，开什么花，帝国主义者恶鬼只能导致战争。
    和平的巨神也正是在制止战争的过程中才显示出其伟大的。
    和平力量击溃了第二次世界大战的制造者希特勒德国和侵略亚洲的日本。和平的力量扑灭了朝鲜的战火。也是因为有和平的力量，帝国主义在越南、印度尼西亚、埃及等的阴谋未能得逞。
    “魔高一尺，道高一丈”这是我们与战争贩子作斗争得出的经验，也只有如此，才能制止战争，战争狂人才不敢肆无忌惮地兴风作浪。任何懦弱、容忍都会给自己招来毁灭。慕尼黑会议，牺牲了捷克并没满足希特勒德国的贪欲，中国过去的“让出东北”也没能制止日本的进一步侵略。这便是血的教训。
    和平的巨神壮大吧，全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，只有“道”高了，才能降住“魔”。
