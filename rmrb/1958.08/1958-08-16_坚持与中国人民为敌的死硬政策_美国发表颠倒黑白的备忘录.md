Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Washington Dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a memorandum to U.S. embassies abroad on August 11th, two days before the start of the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting to discuss halting U.S.-British aggression in the Middle East and withdrawing U.S.-British aggressor troops. The memorandum declared that the U.S. would continue to adhere to its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China.

This eight-thousand-word memorandum, signed by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, sets forth various "reasons" to justify the U.S.'s die-hard policy. It tries its best to distort the facts, misrepresent the situation in Asia and the world, cover up U.S. aggressive policies, sow discord between Asian and African countries and our country, and attempts to impose its will on the governments and peoples of countries that hope to improve relations with our country.

The U.S. State Department's issuance of this memorandum at the current moment is clearly a vain attempt to use anti-communism and opposition to the new China as a smokescreen to cover up its own acts of aggression and aggressive policies, which have been condemned by the entire world, and to resist the strong international pressure against the U.S.'s non-recognition of China and obstruction of the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

This memorandum first strives to prove that the U.S.'s policy of resolutely opposing the Chinese people is not disregarding reality; on the contrary, it "reflects a constant assessment of all the facts that can be obtained." What are these facts? The U.S. State Department boils them down to a basic argument: the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the increasing strength of the People's Republic of China, and its prestige and influence in Asia and the world are "a threat to the security of the United States and the Free World." Therefore, according to the U.S. State Department, "diplomatic non-recognition of the Peking regime is most in line with the interests of the United States and the Free World."

The memorandum pretends to present two so-called "basic considerations" for the U.S.'s China policy. It says, first, "The Soviet bloc (of which Communist China is an important part) is engaged in a long-term struggle to undermine the way of life of free nations throughout the world and to establish communist rule throughout the world. The Chinese Communist regime makes no secret of its fundamentally hostile attitude towards the United States and the entire free world, nor does it hide its openly declared intention to bring them down. Today, its contempt for and attacks on the non-communist world have reached an intensity unseen since the Korean War." Needless to say, these so-called "basic considerations" have nothing in common with the reality of international politics. It is merely a dilapidated weapon from the U.S.'s "psychological warfare" arsenal. The State Department's repetition of this clich√©, which imperialists have been reciting for years, is intended on the one hand to cover up the U.S.'s own policies of aggression and enslavement of the peoples of the world, and on the other hand to reflect the U.S.'s fear of the increasingly powerful socialist countries' resolute opposition to imperialist aggression and active policies to safeguard peace.

When talking about the second "basic consideration" of the China policy, the U.S. authorities pose as the "protector" of the newly independent countries in Asia, saying: "East Asia is particularly vulnerable to the Communist offensive because the free countries in that region are close to Communist China, those countries that have recently won independence lack experience in governance, their past colonial history has created an inherent suspicion of the West, and their path towards modernization will inevitably bring about social, political and economic changes." The U.S.'s fabrication of this so-called "offensive" by China against its neighbors is nothing more than a smokescreen. As the memorandum makes clear, the U.S. wants to issue orders as the anti-communist "savior" of Asia, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, infringe on their sovereignty, and control their destinies.

The memorandum then lists the old slanders against the Chinese people that the U.S. State Department has been repeating in recent years under these two "considerations". It makes no mention of the well-known fact that it is the U.S. that occupies China's Taiwan, launched the war of aggression against Korea, supported the Indochina colonial war, cobbled together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, stirred up trouble in Asia, created tension everywhere, and endangered peace. On the contrary, it falsely accuses China of "primarily concerned not with promoting the welfare of their people in peaceful co-existence with their neighbors. Their primary purpose is to extend the communist revolution beyond their borders to other parts of Asia, and then from there to other parts of the world." Here, it presents as "evidence" that the Chinese people have openly declared "active support for the national independence and liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

The memorandum also attempts to unscrupulously attribute to China the notorious subversive methods that the U.S. has been employing everywhere in Indonesia, the Middle East, and Latin America, falsely accusing China of engaging in "subversion and political infiltration" in Asia, "increasingly adopting propaganda, subversion, 'people's diplomacy,' and political conspiracy." The memorandum also accuses China of "failing to fulfill international obligations," including obligations under the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Geneva Accords on Indochina, and the 1955 Sino-American agreement on the repatriation of civilians. But everyone knows that it is precisely the U.S., and no one else, that has violated these agreements and failed to fulfill the obligations undertaken under these agreements.

The memorandum strives to create a basis for the U.S.'s completely untenable policy. On the one hand, it has to admit that "the Chinese Communist regime currently controls mainland China," but on the other hand, it says that "the Chinese Communist regime does not represent the true will or desires of the Chinese people, and therefore our policy of not recognizing the Chinese Communist regime is actually in line with their (referring to the Chinese people) ultimate interests." The U.S. State Department also made the most frank confession of its die-hard policy of being hostile to the Chinese people to the end. The memorandum said: "The United States believes that Communist rule in China is not permanent and that it will eventually disappear. It wants to accelerate this process of disappearance by not giving Peking diplomatic recognition." It turns out that the U.S.'s policy is nothing else but to overthrow the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and restore imperialist rule in old China. This is what the memorandum shamelessly brags about as the U.S.'s "friendship and sympathy" for the Chinese people.

The memorandum devotes a great deal of space to painstakingly "explaining" the many "effects" that the U.S. fears would arise if it changed its current policy of hostility towards China and non-recognition of China. This part of the memorandum further exposes the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. government's China policy and its current embarrassing and increasingly isolated situation.

The memorandum calls China's territory Taiwan a "strategic island." On the one hand, it worries that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique may collapse at any time, and on the other hand, it expresses its intention to continue to use a handful of reactionaries as tools to oppose the Chinese people. The memorandum said: "U.S. recognition of Communist China would seriously frustrate that government (referring to the Taiwan Chiang gang), if not completely destroy it. On the other hand, continued U.S. recognition and support of the Republic of China enables it to oppose the Chinese Communists' claim to represent the Chinese people and enables those Chinese who are determined to eventually liberate their country from Communist rule to continue to hold hope." This admits without being forced that the U.S. keeps the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary remnant group, which has long been abandoned by the Chinese people, to continue to occupy Taiwan as a military base for its further aggression against China. But the U.S. memorandum also has to admit that the "two Chinas" conspiracy will not work because the Chinese people "will never agree to any solution that would permanently separate Taiwan from China."

The memorandum also admits that an important "consideration" for the U.S.'s non-recognition of China is to continue to obstruct China from playing its due role in the United Nations. It fears that if the U.S. recognizes China, it will inevitably lead to China sending representatives to attend the United Nations and exercising the veto power in the Security Council, which will have "effects" on the United Nations that it fears. When mentioning this issue, the memorandum once again repeats the already bankrupt slanders of the U.S. government. Everyone knows that it was the U.S. that stole the name of the United Nations to carry out a war of aggression in Korea, thereby tarnishing the reputation of the United Nations, but the U.S. once again shamelessly pulled out the slander of China "not having cleared its name of aggression" to justify its conspiracy to manipulate the United Nations.

The memorandum expresses its fear that U.S. recognition of China would have a negative impact on many other countries in Asia and bring unimaginable consequences to the cause of the free world in that region." This first and foremost means that the "cause" of the U.S. puppet South Korean Syngman Rhee group and South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem group would suffer fatal damage. It is even more afraid that the policies of some Western countries that have been completely relying on U.S. high-pressure tactics to maintain non-recognition of China would completely collapse due to the U.S.'s change, thereby seriously undermining the U.S.'s aggressive policies in various regions under the guise of anti-communism. The memorandum also states that the U.S.'s non-recognition of China is also intended to continue to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek group to threaten and deceive the vast number of overseas Chinese scattered throughout Southeast Asia.

The memorandum finally expresses the U.S.'s determination to disregard reality, adopt a die-hard attitude to the end, and insist on being hostile to the Chinese people. It admits that the U.S.'s policy has been criticized by Asian countries, but the U.S. "would rather let certain neutral countries" think that China is "treated unfairly" than let the U.S.'s so-called "allies" in Asia feel "confused and frustrated."
