Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Washington Dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a memorandum to U.S. embassies abroad on August 11th, two days before the start of the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting to discuss halting U.S.-British aggression in the Middle East and withdrawing U.S.-British aggressor troops. The memorandum declared that the U.S. would continue to adhere to its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China.

This eight-thousand-word memorandum, signed by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, sets forth various "reasons" to justify the U.S.'s die-hard policy. It tries its best to distort the facts, misrepresent the situation in Asia and the world, cover up U.S. aggressive policies, sow discord between Asian and African countries and our country, and attempts to impose its will on the governments and peoples of countries that hope to improve relations with our country.

The U.S. State Department's issuance of this memorandum at the current moment is clearly a vain attempt to use anti-communism and opposition to the new China as a smokescreen to cover up its own acts of aggression and aggressive policies, which have been condemned by the entire world, and to resist the strong international pressure against the U.S.'s non-recognition of China and obstruction of the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

This memorandum first strives to prove that the U.S.'s policy of resolutely opposing the Chinese people is not disregarding reality; on the contrary, it "reflects a constant assessment of all the facts that can be obtained." What are these facts? The U.S. State Department boils them down to a basic argument: the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the increasing strength of the People's Republic of China, and its prestige and influence in Asia and the world are "a threat to the security of the United States and the Free World." Therefore, according to the U.S. State Department, "diplomatic non-recognition of the Peking regime is most in line with the interests of the United States and the Free World."

The memorandum pretends to present two so-called "basic considerations" for the U.S.'s China policy. It says, first, "The Soviet bloc (of which Communist China is an important part) is engaged in a long-term struggle to undermine the way of life of free nations throughout the world and to establish communist rule throughout the world. The Chinese Communist regime makes no secret of its fundamentally hostile attitude towards the United States and the entire free world, nor does it hide its openly declared intention to bring them down. Today, its contempt for and attacks on the non-communist world have reached an intensity unseen since the Korean War." Needless to say, these so-called "basic considerations" have nothing in common with the reality of international politics. It is merely a dilapidated weapon from the U.S.'s "psychological warfare" arsenal. The State Department's repetition of this cliché, which imperialists have been reciting for years, is intended on the one hand to cover up the U.S.'s own policies of aggression and enslavement of the peoples of the world, and on the other hand to reflect the U.S.'s fear of the increasingly powerful socialist countries' resolute opposition to imperialist aggression and active policies to safeguard peace.

When talking about the second "basic consideration" of the China policy, the U.S. authorities pose as the "protector" of the newly independent countries in Asia, saying: "East Asia is particularly vulnerable to the Communist offensive because the free countries in that region are close to Communist China, those countries that have recently won independence lack experience in governance, their past colonial history has created an inherent suspicion of the West, and their path towards modernization will inevitably bring about social, political and economic changes." The U.S.'s fabrication of this so-called "offensive" by China against its neighbors is nothing more than a smokescreen. As the memorandum makes clear, the U.S. wants to issue orders as the anti-communist "savior" of Asia, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, infringe on their sovereignty, and control their destinies.

The memorandum then lists the old slanders against the Chinese people that the U.S. State Department has been repeating in recent years under these two "considerations". It makes no mention of the well-known fact that it is the U.S. that occupies China's Taiwan, launched the war of aggression against Korea, supported the Indochina colonial war, cobbled together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, stirred up trouble in Asia, created tension everywhere, and endangered peace. On the contrary, it falsely accuses China of "primarily concerned not with promoting the welfare of their people in peaceful co-existence with their neighbors. Their primary purpose is to extend the communist revolution beyond their borders to other parts of Asia, and then from there to other parts of the world." Here, it presents as "evidence" that the Chinese people have openly declared "active support for the national independence and liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

The memorandum also attempts to unscrupulously attribute to China the notorious subversive methods that the U.S. has been employing everywhere in Indonesia, the Middle East, and Latin America, falsely accusing China of engaging in "subversion and political infiltration" in Asia, "increasingly adopting propaganda, subversion, 'people's diplomacy,' and political conspiracy." The memorandum also accuses China of "failing to fulfill international obligations," including obligations under the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Geneva Accords on Indochina, and the 1955 Sino-American agreement on the repatriation of civilians. But everyone knows that it is precisely the U.S., and no one else, that has violated these agreements and failed to fulfill the obligations undertaken under these agreements.

The memorandum strives to create a basis for the U.S.'s completely untenable policy. On the one hand, it has to admit that "the Chinese Communist regime currently controls mainland China," but on the other hand, it says that "the Chinese Communist regime does not represent the true will or desires of the Chinese people, and therefore our policy of not recognizing the Chinese Communist regime is actually in line with their (referring to the Chinese people) ultimate interests." The U.S. State Department also made the most frank confession of its die-hard policy of being hostile to the Chinese people to the end. The memorandum said: "The United States believes that Communist rule in China is not permanent and that it will eventually disappear. It wants to accelerate this process of disappearance by not giving Peking diplomatic recognition." It turns out that the U.S.'s policy is nothing else but to overthrow the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and restore imperialist rule in old China. This is what the memorandum shamelessly brags about as the U.S.'s "friendship and sympathy" for the Chinese people.

The memorandum devotes a great deal of space to painstakingly "explaining" the many "effects" that the U.S. fears would arise if it changed its current policy of hostility towards China and non-recognition of China. This part of the memorandum further exposes the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. government's China policy and its current embarrassing and increasingly isolated situation.

The memorandum calls China's territory Taiwan a "strategic island." On the one hand, it worries that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique may collapse at any time, and on the other hand, it expresses its intention to continue to use a handful of reactionaries as tools to oppose the Chinese people. The memorandum said: "U.S. recognition of Communist China would seriously frustrate that government (referring to the Taiwan Chiang gang), if not completely destroy it. On the other hand, continued U.S. recognition and support of the Republic of China enables it to oppose the Chinese Communists' claim to represent the Chinese people and enables those Chinese who are determined to eventually liberate their country from Communist rule to continue to hold hope." This admits without being forced that the U.S. keeps the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary remnant group, which has long been abandoned by the Chinese people, to continue to occupy Taiwan as a military base for its further aggression against China. But the U.S. memorandum also has to admit that the "two Chinas" conspiracy will not work because the Chinese people "will never agree to any solution that would permanently separate Taiwan from China."

The memorandum also admits that an important "consideration" for the U.S.'s non-recognition of China is to continue to obstruct China from playing its due role in the United Nations. It fears that if the U.S. recognizes China, it will inevitably lead to China sending representatives to attend the United Nations and exercising the veto power in the Security Council, which will have "effects" on the United Nations that it fears. When mentioning this issue, the memorandum once again repeats the already bankrupt slanders of the U.S. government. Everyone knows that it was the U.S. that stole the name of the United Nations to carry out a war of aggression in Korea, thereby tarnishing the reputation of the United Nations, but the U.S. once again shamelessly pulled out the slander of China "not having cleared its name of aggression" to justify its conspiracy to manipulate the United Nations.

The memorandum expresses its fear that U.S. recognition of China would have a negative impact on many other countries in Asia and bring unimaginable consequences to the cause of the free world in that region." This first and foremost means that the "cause" of the U.S. puppet South Korean Syngman Rhee group and South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem group would suffer fatal damage. It is even more afraid that the policies of some Western countries that have been completely relying on U.S. high-pressure tactics to maintain non-recognition of China would completely collapse due to the U.S.'s change, thereby seriously undermining the U.S.'s aggressive policies in various regions under the guise of anti-communism. The memorandum also states that the U.S.'s non-recognition of China is also intended to continue to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek group to threaten and deceive the vast number of overseas Chinese scattered throughout Southeast Asia.

The memorandum finally expresses the U.S.'s determination to disregard reality, adopt a die-hard attitude to the end, and insist on being hostile to the Chinese people. It admits that the U.S.'s policy has been criticized by Asian countries, but the U.S. "would rather let certain neutral countries" think that China is "treated unfairly" than let the U.S.'s so-called "allies" in Asia feel "confused and frustrated."

### 坚持与中国人民为敌的死硬政策　美国发表颠倒黑白的备忘录

　　坚持与中国人民为敌的死硬政策
　　美国发表颠倒黑白的备忘录
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院在8月11日，也就是联合国大会紧急会议开始讨论制止美英在中东的侵略和撤退美英侵略军问题的前两天，发表了一份给美国驻外使团的备忘录，声明美国要继续坚持与中国人民为敌和拒绝承认中华人民共和国的政策。
    这份由美国国务卿杜勒斯签署的长达八千字的备忘录，为美国的死硬政策陈述了种种辩解的“理由”，它竭力颠倒黑白，歪曲亚洲和世界局势，掩饰美国的侵略政策，挑拨亚非国家和我国的关系，并力图把自己的意志强加于希望同我国改善关系的各国政府和人民的头上。
    美国国务院在当前的时机里发表这份备忘录，显然是妄想以反对共产主义和反对新中国为幌子来掩护它自己遭到全世界谴责的侵略行动和侵略政策，并且企图借此抵挡一下当前国际间反对美国不承认中国和阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法席位的强大压力。
    这份备忘录首先竭力企图证明：美国这种坚决同中国人民作对的政策并不是无视现实的，相反，它“反映了对于一切可以得到的事实的不断的估计”。这些事实究竟是什么呢？美国国务院把它们归结为一个基本论点，这就是：中国人民革命的胜利、中华人民共和国的日益强大和它在亚洲与全世界的威望和影响，是对“美国和自由世界的安全的威胁”。因此，按照美国国务院的说法，“在外交上不承认北平政权是最符合美国和自由世界的利益的”。
    备忘录装模作样地提出美国对华政策的所谓两点“基本考虑”。它说，第一，“苏联集团（共产党中国是这个集团的重要组成部分）正在从事破坏全世界自由国家生活方式和在全世界建立共产主义统治的长期斗争。中共政权毫不掩饰它在根本上敌视美国和整个自由世界的态度，也不掩饰它公然宣布的要使它们垮台的意图。今天，它对非共产党世界的蔑视和攻击已经发展到了朝鲜战争以来从未见过的那种强烈的程度。”不用说，这种所谓“基本考虑”与国际政治现实当然毫无共同之处，它只不过是美国“心理作战”武器库里早已破烂的家伙。国务院重复这种多少年来帝国主义者背诵如流的滥调，一方面是为了掩饰美国自己在全世界侵略和奴役各国人民的政策，另方面也反映出美国对于日益强大的社会主义阵营国家坚决反对帝国主义侵略和维护和平的积极政策的恐惧。
    美国当局在谈到对华政策的第二点“基本考虑”时俨然以亚洲新独立国家的“保护者”自居，它说：“东亚特别容易为共产党的攻势所压倒，因为那个地区的自由国家靠近共产党中国，那些最近才赢得独立的国家在治理方面经验不足，它们过去的殖民地历史造成它们对西方有一种固有的怀疑，并且它们向现代化发展的过程必然会带来社会、政治、经济等方面的变化。”美国捏造这种所谓中国对它的近邻的“攻势”的说法，只不过是一种障眼手法，备忘录说得很清楚，美国就是要以亚洲的反共的“救世主”身份来发号施令，干涉亚洲国家的内政，侵犯它们的主权，支配它们的命运。
    备忘录接着就在这两点“考虑”下面把美国国务院近年来诬蔑中国人民的老调一一罗列出来。它根本不提霸占中国的台湾、发动侵略朝鲜战争、支持印度支那殖民战争、拼凑东南亚条约集团、在亚洲兴风作浪、到处制造紧张局势和危害和平的正是美国这一众所周知的事实，反而倒咬一口，诬蔑中国“主要关心的并不是在同邻国和平共处的情况下增进他们的人民的福利。他们的主要目的是要把共产主义革命扩展到他们国境之外的亚洲其他地区，然后再从那里扩展到世界其他地区”。在这里它提出的一个“证据”是：中国人民曾经公开宣布“积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族独立和解放运动”。
    备忘录还企图把美国在印度尼西亚、在中东、在拉丁美洲到处施展的臭名远扬的颠覆手段无中生有地硬加在中国头上，诬蔑中国在亚洲搞“颠覆和政治渗入”，“日益采用宣传、颠覆、‘人民外交’、政治阴谋手段”。备忘录还诬蔑中国“不履行国际义务”，包括朝鲜停战协定、关于印度支那停战的日内瓦协定和1955年中美两国关于双方平民回国问题的协议中的各项义务。但是谁都知道，破坏这些协定、违反根据这些协定所承担的义务的恰恰是美国而不是别人。
    备忘录竭力为美国的完全站不住脚的政策制造根据，它一方面不得不承认“中国共产党政权目前控制着大陆中国这一事实”，另一方面却说，“中国共产党政权并不代表中国人民的真正意志或愿望，因而我们不承认中国共产党政权的政策在实际上是符合他们（指中国人民）的最终利益的。”美国国务院对敌视中国人民到底的死硬政策还作了最坦白的招供，备忘录说：“美国认为，共产主义在中国的统治不是永久性的，它有朝一日总会消失的。它想通过不给北平外交上的承认的作法，来加速这种消失的过程。”原来美国的政策不是别的，而是为了要推翻中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命的胜利果实，恢复帝国主义在旧中国的统治，这就是备忘录所无耻吹嘘的美国对中国人民的“友好和同情”。
    备忘录用很大的篇幅来挖空心思地“说明”如果改变目前敌视中国和不承认中国的政策就会产生美国所害怕的许多“影响”。备忘录的这一部分进一步暴露了美国政府对华政策的彻底破产和它目前狼狈、日益孤立的处境。
    备忘录把中国的领土台湾叫作一个“战略性的岛屿”，一方面担心蒋介石反动集团随时垮台，另一方面又表示要继续使一小撮反动分子成为敌视中国人民的工具。备忘录说：“美国承认共产党中国就会严重地挫伤那个政府
  （指台湾蒋帮），如果不是完全毁了它的话。另一方面，美国继续承认和支持中华民国就使它能够反对中国共产党人自称代表中国人民的说法，并且使那些决心最后把他们的国家从共产党的统治下面解放出来的中国人继续怀抱希望。”这就不打自招，美国豢养着早就被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石反革命残余集团，就是为了继续霸占台湾，作为它进一步侵略中国的军事基地。但是美国备忘录也不得不承认，“两个中国”的阴谋行不通，因为中国人民“永远不会同意任何会使台湾永久脱离中国的解决办法”。
    备忘录还承认，美国不承认中国的一个重要“考虑”，是为了继续阻挠中国在联合国中起它应有的作用。它害怕，如果美国承认中国，就必然会导政中国派代表出席联合国，而且将行使在安全理事会中的否决权，因而会对联合国产生它所害怕的“影响”。在提到这个问题时，备忘录又重复了早已破产了的美国政府的诬蔑。谁都知道，正是美国盗窃了联合国的名义在朝鲜进行侵略战争，因而沾污了联合国的名誉，但是美国再一次无耻地搬出诬蔑中国“没有洗清它的侵略罪名”的谰言来为它的操纵联合国的阴谋辩解。
    备忘录表示害怕，美国承认中国对于亚洲的其他许多国家“将产生不良的影响，给自由世界那一地区的事业带来不堪设想的后果”，这首先是使美国傀儡南朝鲜李承晚集团和南越吴庭艳集团的“事业”受到致命的损害。它更加害怕的是，迄今完全依靠美国的高压手段来维持住的西方一些国家不承认中国的政策会因美国的改变而全盘瓦解，从而使美国在各个地区以反对共产主义为名而推行的侵略政策遭到严重打击。备忘录还表示，美国不承认中国也是为了想继续和蒋介石集团勾结一起，威胁蒙蔽那些散处在东南亚各地的广大华侨。
    备忘录最后表示美国决心不顾现实，采取死硬到底的态度，坚持和中国人民为敌。它承认美国的这种政策受到亚洲各国的指责，但是美国“宁可让某些中立国家”认为中国“受到不公平的待遇”，也不能让美国在亚洲的所谓“盟国”感到“困惑和沮丧”。
