    Comprehensive Utilization of Coal, Developing Diversified Operations
    Shijingshan Power Plant – Multi-Material and Multi-Functional
    (Our Newspaper News) The Shijingshan Power Plant has recently begun diversified operations, extracting coal tar and ammonium sulfate from coal, manufacturing cement from coal ash, and manufacturing 50-kilowatt hydro generators. This approach points to a new direction for production.
    This plant uses more than 500,000 tons of coal a year. In the past, everyone had tried various ways to reduce coal consumption rates, but no one had ever thought of engaging in sideline production.
    In January of this year, comrades from the Technical Improvement Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power came to the plant and suggested trying to make cement from coal ash. They said that the Soviet Union had advanced experience in making cement from coal ash, without adding any equipment, by mixing coal with limestone and burning it in a boiler, and then adding gypsum to make cement. But many people disagreed when they heard this. Some were afraid of the trouble. Some said: "If limestone is added to the coal, the melting point will be low and it will easily form nodules, and the temperature will be high, so the furnace will have to be shut down." In short, there were many concerns, so they never started doing it.
    In June, the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission held a meeting and proposed that Beijing should be built into an industrial base in five years. Currently, cement is relatively tight, and asked whether the power plant could consider producing cement? The comrades from the plant who attended the meeting returned to the plant for discussion. After discussion, everyone believed that cement should be trial-produced from coal ash. They burned it for eight hours and produced more than 20 tons of cement. This cement can be mixed with mortar or used as precast components.
    However, the grade of this cement produced from coal ash is low and cannot be used to build factories. They wanted to make high-grade cement, but when they saw the standard design workload of the Ministry of Construction Engineering was too large, they hesitated a bit. Later, the factory took the drawings to the engineers and veteran workers for discussion, and the workers used pig iron to make a balling machine for making cement. Now they are transforming the factory's three abandoned vertical kilns, and after the renovation, they will all be put into production in August, producing 100 tons of cement with a grade of 400 to 600 per day. This can meet the cement needs of the new Gaojing Power Station.
    In early July this year, Comrade Liu Shaoqi visited the Shijingshan Power Plant, and he encouraged everyone to extract coal tar from coal. The method of refining oil is very simple, just put the coal in a pool, connect a pipe underneath, and the coal will produce oil after it is lit from above. The oil passes through a cooling tower to become coal tar, and then through another cooling tower to become ammonium sulfate. Everyone decided to try it. But some people looked at the design of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and felt a little lacking in confidence. The design stated that it would take several months to build the pool, the investment would be 75,000 yuan, and 188 workers would be needed. Where could the factory find so many workers and so much money now?
    After a discussion among the workers, all the problems were solved. For people, family members can be organized. As for materials, the factory has plenty. They found a discarded steel pipe, and found a motor that was not used in a workshop, and got some bricks, and started building the pool. It cost less than 20,000 yuan in total. They started construction on July 15, and will be put into production recently. After production starts, only one or twenty people will be needed to manage it on weekdays. According to statistics, after it is put into production, it can produce 3,000 tons of coal tar and 300 tons of ammonium sulfate that can be used as chemical fertilizer every year, and it can also produce coal gas equivalent to 13,000 tons of coal. This coal tar can be refined into gasoline, heavy diesel, light diesel, paraffin, asphalt, nylon, plastics and more than 300 other products. It can also be refined into valuable chemical products.
    The workers at this factory are currently actively manufacturing 50-kilowatt hydro generators to support rural electrification.
    The workers also plan to find their own ways to use old lathes instead of new lathes, and use small lathes instead of large lathes, to make supporting equipment for the Gaojing Power Station. Now the workers are in high spirits, and everyone is learning to be versatile. Repair workers are learning to manufacture, operating workers are learning to overhaul, and overhaul workers are learning to install. They are preparing to take over the installation work of the Gaojing Power Station and do it themselves.

### 综合利用煤炭  开展多种经营  石景山发电厂多材多能

    综合利用煤炭  开展多种经营
    石景山发电厂多材多能
    本报讯  石景山发电厂最近开始多种经营，从煤中提炼煤焦油和硫酸氨，用煤灰制造水泥，并制造五十瓩的水轮发电机。这种作法给生产指出了新的方向。
    这个厂一年要用五十多万吨的煤。过去，大家也曾多方想法降低煤耗率，但根本就没想到还能搞副业生产。
    今年1月，电力部技术改进局的同志到厂里来，曾建议用煤灰试制水泥，他们说苏联有个用煤灰制水泥的先进经验，不加添任何设备，用煤掺上石灰石在锅炉里烧，出来加上石膏就成水泥。但很多人听了都不同意。有的是嫌麻烦。有的说：“煤里加了石灰石，熔点低容易结瘤子，气温高，要停炉子。”总之顾虑重重，所以一直没有动手做。
    6月，北京市计划委员会开会，提出北京市五年里要建成工业基地，目前水泥比较紧张，问发电厂能否考虑生产水泥？这个厂参加会议的同志回厂进行了讨论，经过讨论，大家认为应该用煤灰试制水泥。他们烧了八小时，烧出了二十多吨水泥。这种水泥可掺沙浆用，也可作预制构件。
    可是这些用煤灰生产的水泥，标号低，不能建工厂。他们想造高标号水泥，但一看建筑工程部的标准设计工作量太大，又有点犹豫。后来厂里把图拿给工程师和老工人讨论，工人们用生铁做成了作水泥的成球机。现在他们正在改造厂里的三个废立窑，改好后8月就全部投入生产，每日可以生产一百吨标号四百到六百的水泥。可以满足新建高井电站水泥的需要。
    今年7月初刘少奇同志到石景山发电厂视察，他鼓励大家用煤炼煤焦油。炼油的方法很简单，只要把煤放在池里，下面通根管子，煤从上面点着后就能出油，油经管子通过冷却塔就成煤焦油，再经过一个冷却塔就成硫酸氨。大家决定试一试。但有些人看了石油工业部的设计，有点信心不足，设计上写着，要盖池子得几个月，投资得七万五千元，还要用一百八十八个工人。现在厂里到哪里去找那么多工人和那么多钱？
    经过工人一讨论，问题都解决了。人，可以组织家属，材料，厂里有的是，他们找了一根废了的钢管，又找了一个车间不用的马达，弄了些砖，就动手盖起池子来。总共花了还不到二万元。他们从7月15日开始修建，最近就可投入生产。开工后，平日只要一、二十人管理就行了。据统计，投入生产后，每年可产三千吨煤焦油和三百吨可作化学肥料的硫酸氨，还可生产等于一万三千吨煤的煤气。用这种煤焦油可以炼出汽油、重柴油、轻柴油、石腊、沥青、尼隆、塑料等三百多种产品。还可以炼出贵重的化学用品。
    这个厂的工人目前正在积极制造五十瓩的水轮发电机，支援农村电气化。
    工人们还打算自己想办法用旧车床代新车床，用小车床代大车床，给高井电站作配套设备。现在工人情绪很高，大家学作多面手，修理工学制造，运行工学检修，检修工学安装，他们准备把高井电站的安装工作，都接过来自己干。
