Supplying the Country with More Fine Breeds of Livestock
Inner Mongolia Establishes Sanhe Cattle and Sanhe Horse Breeding Bases

(Our report) The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is actively establishing new breeding bases for Sanhe cattle and Sanhe horses in Hulunbuir League. Hundreds and thousands of people are working intensively at the sites of the fifteen state-owned farms that have been selected, building houses, surveying and planning, storing feed, and developing feed bases.

Starting this year, Hulunbuir League plans to establish five state-owned farm groups during the Second Five-Year Plan. According to this task, in addition to the planned expansion of old farms and the development of new farms near old ones, the focus this year is on establishing new state-owned Sanhe cattle and Sanhe horse farm groups in Sanhedao. After these farms are completed, it is estimated that they can hand over to the state more than 45,000 Sanhe cattle and Sanhe horses, more than 60,000 tons of milk, and a large number of sheep, pigs, wheat, sugar and other products each year.

Hulunbuir League is one of China's famous natural grasslands and has good conditions for large-scale development of state-owned farms. Since 1954, Hulunbuir League has successively established twenty-two state-owned farms and ranches, with nearly 30,000 livestock, most of which are excellent breeds of Sanhe horses and Sanhe cattle.

　　供应国家更多的良种牲畜
　　内蒙古建立三河牛三河马繁殖基地
    本报讯  内蒙古自治区正在呼伦贝尔盟积极建立新的繁殖三河牛、三河马的基地。成百上千的人正在已经选定的十五个国营牧场场址上紧张地修建住宅、勘测规划、打贮饲草和开垦饲料基地等工作。
    从今年起，呼伦贝尔盟准备在第二个五年计划期间，建立五个国营牧场群。根据这一任务，除有计划地扩建老场，在老场附近发展新场外，今年首先集中力量在三河道建立新的三河牛、三河马的国营牧场群。这些牧场建成后，预计每年可以上缴国家三河牛、三河马四万五千多头，牛奶六万多吨，以及大量的羊、猪和小麦、糖等产品。
    呼伦贝尔盟是我国著名的天然大草原之一，具有大规模发展国营牧场的良好条件。自1954年以来，呼伦贝尔盟曾先后建立了二十二处国营农牧场，拥有近三万头牲畜，其中大部分都是品种优良的三河马和三河牛。
