　　Good News of Peace
　　National Quyi Performance Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Delegation, Pa Jie. To defend world peace, the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet people held talks in the people's capital, Beijing, for a full four days. The good news of peace spread throughout the Inner Mongolian grasslands. All ethnic groups are a hundred times more confident, and united to oppose the American and British aggression in the Middle East. Although there are many lilac trees, they emit the same fragrance. Although there are many democratic countries, they all have the same desire for peace. Although there are many mountain apple trees, they all bear the same fruit. Hundreds of millions of peace-loving people have hearts that are alike. Straight poplar trees have branches that all point upwards. Our 800 million people have hearts linked together. The friendship of 800 million people is as deep as the sea. We wholeheartedly love our new life, support the just struggle of the Arab people, and create lasting world peace.
