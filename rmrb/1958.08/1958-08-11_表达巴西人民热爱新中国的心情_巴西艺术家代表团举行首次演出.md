Xinhua News Agency, August 10th. The Brazilian Broadcasting and Television Artists Delegation held its first performance at the People's Theater tonight. This first artistic group from Brazil was warmly welcomed by 1,400 spectators in Beijing tonight.

The Brazilian artists performed more than ten folk songs, folk dances, and instrumental performances reflecting the life and struggle of the Brazilian people tonight. All the programs were met with thunderous applause. Due to the audience's repeated enthusiastic requests, the Brazilian artists had to perform each program again almost every time it ended. When folk song soloist Jorge Goulart sang the folk song "Savior of the Blacks," the audience accepted his enthusiastic request and sang along with him. The atmosphere in the theater was exceptionally lively.

At the opening ceremony before the performance, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered a speech warmly welcoming the Brazilian guests who had come from afar. He said that Brazil's most outstanding artists, carrying the friendship of the Brazilian people, have brought performances with unique national styles and superb artistic levels to perform for the Chinese people, symbolizing a further development of friendship and cultural exchange between the two peoples, and will further promote the friendship and cultural ties between the two countries.

In his speech, Chu Tunan also expressed sympathy and support for the just anti-colonialist struggles of the Latin American and Brazilian people. He said that the people of Latin American countries are standing up, and their desire to control their own destiny will surely be realized.

Alberto C. Camargo, head of the delegation, said in his reply that this time the Brazilian art troupe finally broke through foreign obstacles, crossed four continents, and brought the Brazilian people's friendship and wishes for peace to the Chinese people. He said that the Brazilian people have always hoped to establish friendly relations with the great Soviet and Chinese people, and their visit to China this time is to express the Brazilian people's love for New China.

Alberto C. Camargo, head of the delegation, thanked Chu Tunan for his speech supporting the anti-colonialist struggle in Latin America.

    阿尔柏托·卡莫团长在致答词中说，这一次巴西艺术团终于冲破外来的障碍，穿过四个大洲，给中国人民带来了巴西人民的友谊和和平的祝愿。他说，巴西人民一直希望同伟大的苏联和中国人民建立友好关系，他们这次到中国来演出，就是要向中国人民表达巴西人民热爱新中国的心情。
    阿尔柏托·卡莫团长对楚图南支持拉丁美洲反殖民主义斗争的讲话表示感谢。他说，在全世界被压迫人民争取自由和独立的斗争中，七千万巴西人民也在进行着反对外国经济控制的斗争。
