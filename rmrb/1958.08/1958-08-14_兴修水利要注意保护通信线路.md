　　Pay Attention to Protecting Communication Lines When Building Water Conservancy Projects
    Since last winter, large-scale water conservancy projects have been underway across the country. In this surging movement, some places have not paid enough attention to the protection of communication lines. For example, in a certain area of central Hebei, a canal was built only five meters away from the power lines, running parallel for more than twenty kilometers. The excavated soil buried the base of the utility poles by two to three meters. In several places, the lines were only two meters away from the accumulated soil. This makes the lines vulnerable to damage, the utility poles prone to rot, the lines difficult to move, and the removal of the accumulated soil even more difficult. Some, when designing reservoirs, needed to move the power lines, but did not contact the relevant units in advance, and only notified them urgently after the reservoir construction had begun; others could have avoided the lines but did not, and knocked down the utility poles. All of the above situations have caused many difficulties for the maintenance of communication lines.
    Ensuring uninterrupted communication is very important for the transmission of national policies, economic construction, and the consolidation of national defense. If communication lines are damaged, even for a short time, it can cause serious consequences. With the development of agricultural production, the scale of water conservancy construction will be even larger in the future. Therefore, it is suggested that all localities pay attention to protecting communication lines in the construction of water conservancy projects, and the following suggestions are put forward:
    1. When surveying and designing reservoirs or canals, if it is found that there are power lines passing through, contact the relevant competent departments in advance; avoid the lines as much as possible if they can be avoided.
    2. Before starting construction, urge the relevant units to take measures on the lines, either to move them, or to raise and reinforce them, because the dispatch of line workers and the transportation of materials require a certain amount of time. Some major trunk lines have high technical requirements and must be prepared in advance.
    3. Local people's committees and agricultural cooperatives should regularly educate the broad masses of commune members to pay attention to protecting power lines. If any damage is found, report it to the relevant business departments immediately and assist in quick repairs.

### 兴修水利要注意保护通信线路

　　兴修水利要注意保护通信线路
    自去冬以来，全国各地都在大量地兴修水利。在这汹涌澎湃的运动中，有少数地方对通信线路的保护注意不够。如河北冀中某地，修一条渠道与电线相距仅五公尺，平行达二十余公里，挖出的土将电杆根部埋二至三公尺，有几处线条距积土仅两公尺，这样使线条易遭损坏，电杆容易腐烂，线路移动很困难，排除积土更困难。有的在设计水库时，电线需要迁移，但事先不与有关单位联系，水库开工了，临时通知，要求很急；有的本来可以避开线路而没有避开，将电杆挖倒。以上种种情况，给通信线路的维护造成了很多困难。
    保证不间断的通信，对国家政令的传达，经济建设和国防的巩固都是十分重要的。如通信线路遭到损坏，虽然是很短时间，但也能造成严重的后果。随着农业生产的发展，今后水利建设的规模将更大。因此，建议各地在兴修水利中，要注意保护通信线路，并提出如下意见：
    一、在勘察设计水库或渠道时，如发现有电线通过，应事先与有关主管部门取得联系；能够避开线路的应尽可能避开。
    二、在动工前，应督促有关单位对线路采取措施，或迁移，或升高加固，因为架线人力的调遣，器材的筹运，都需要一定的时间，有些主要干线，技术要求高，必须事先筹备。
    三、各地人民委员会和农业社，应经常教育广大社员，注意保护电线，如发现有损坏，立即设法报告有关业务部门，并协助迅速修复。
