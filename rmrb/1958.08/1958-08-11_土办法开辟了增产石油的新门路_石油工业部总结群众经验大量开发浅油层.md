Xinhua News Agency, August 9th:

　　According to the creations of petroleum workers in Yumen, Xinjiang, and other places, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry recently summarized a set of experiences in exploiting shallow oil layers using indigenous methods. This set of experiences includes three aspects: drilling, oil extraction, and refining. According to preliminary calculations, using this indigenous method to exploit shallow oil layers, the average cost per ton of crude oil does not exceed twenty yuan, which is half the cost of the current Yumen Oil Mine, and the entire oil field construction investment can be recovered in less than a year.

　　Exploiting shallow oil layers is an important measure for the whole people to run the petroleum industry. There are many shallow oil layers in various parts of China. According to incomplete statistics, shallow oil layers that can be submitted for exploitation design can produce at least 10 million tons of crude oil per year on average. However, in the past, these shallow oil layers were often considered to have no exploitation value and were abandoned because no suitable exploitation methods could be found. After the "Whole People Run Industry" policy was put forward, petroleum workers in Yumen, Xinjiang, and other places first developed the spirit of daring to think and act, and created a large number of simple and effective advanced experiences in drilling, oil extraction, and refining by combining indigenous and foreign methods. These experiences were exchanged at a field meeting held in Yumen Oil Mine not long ago.

　　After this experience exchange meeting, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry initially affirmed several experiences with universal promotion value. In terms of drilling, small-diameter wells are densely drilled mainly with light drilling rigs; in terms of oil extraction, various simple pumping units and simple refining methods created by Yumen Oil Mine workers are adopted. These drilling, oil extraction, and refining operation techniques are very easy. Ordinary farmers can learn them in just two or three months, or even just one or two days; at the same time, the equipment structure is simple, the price is low, general machinery factories can manufacture them in large quantities, and the cost of oil field construction is also very low, which is suitable for exploitation at the county, district, and township levels.

　　The advanced experiences that have been summarized are currently being promoted by the petroleum industry department, while continuing to carry out various creative experiments to make them more suitable for mass adoption.

　　土办法开辟了增产石油的新门路
　　石油工业部总结群众经验大量开发浅油层
    据新华社9日讯　根据玉门、新疆等地石油职工的创造，石油工业部最近总结出一套用土办法开采浅油层的经验。这套经验包括打井、采油和炼制三个方面。据初步计算，运用这种土办法开采浅油层，平均每吨原油成本不超过二十元，比目前玉门油矿的成本要低一半，全部油田建设投资不到一年就能收回。
    开采浅油层是全民办石油工业的一项重要措施。我国各地的浅油层很多。据不完全统计，可以提交开采设计的浅油层，平均每年至少可以生产一千万吨原油。但是，这些浅油层过去由于找不到适当的开采方法，常被认为没有开采价值而丢掉。“全民办工业”的方针提出以后，玉门、新疆等地的石油工人首先发扬了敢想敢做的精神，用土洋结合的办法，创造了大批简易有效的钻井、采油和炼油的先进经验，这些经验不久以前在玉门油矿召开的现场会议上作了交流。
    在这次经验交流会开过以后，石油工业部初步肯定了几种具有普遍推广价值的经验。在打井方面，主要用轻便钻机密集打小眼井；在采油方面，采用玉门油矿职工创造的多种简便的抽油机和简易的炼油方法。这些钻井、采油和炼油的操作技术都很容易，普通农民只要学习两、三个月甚至只要一两天就能学会；同时设备结构简单、价格低廉、一般机械工厂都能大量制造，而且油田建设费用也很低，适宜于县区乡级开采。
    已经总结出的这些先进经验，石油工业部门目前一面在组织推广，一面在继续进行各种创造性的试验，以便使它更适宜于群众大量采用。
