　　Hydrogen Bomb Vacation
　　By Pan Fei, Staff Reporter
    The cessation of hydrogen bomb testing is the urgent wish of people all over the world. The Soviet Union had already done so five months ago. On the evening of August 22, the U.S. and British governments issued separate statements announcing their readiness to halt hydrogen bomb testing for one year starting October 31.

    Of course, if the U.S. and British statements can be realized, it cannot be said that this is no different from continuing unrestricted testing.

    However, there is still a great distance between the statements of the U.S. and British governments and the wishes of people all over the world. It is necessary to make an objective assessment of this statement.

    The cessation of hydrogen bomb testing by the U.S. and Britain is not unconditional. They stated that if the Soviet Union does not resume testing during this period and begins negotiations to establish "effective international supervision" (they propose to hold talks in New York with the Soviet Union on October 31), the U.S. and Britain will halt hydrogen bomb testing for one year.

    Strangely, at the same time as this statement was issued, the British government began a series of hydrogen bomb explosions on Christmas Island in the Pacific. Similarly, according to British newspapers, the United States will conduct large-scale tests before October 31.

    Why can't hydrogen bomb testing be stopped immediately from today? Why the rush to carry out a major campaign before stopping testing? This reason can be explained by the "Daily Telegraph" editorial. It wrote: This is to "obtain the results of these tests before negotiating with the Soviet Union on October 31." The newspaper's conclusion is: Therefore, stopping hydrogen bomb testing is "not harmful" to the UK and the US. The fact is: the basis for the U.S. and Britain to stop hydrogen bomb testing is based on large-scale tests that have already begun and are about to begin. How much harm these large-scale tests bring to human safety does not seem to be within the consideration of the U.S. and British governments.

    The U.S. and British governments also announced that after one year of suspending hydrogen bomb testing, they would continue to suspend testing for another year if a series of prerequisites could be met. These conditions are: 1. The Soviet Union continues not to conduct tests; 2. A satisfactory international supervision system for the cessation of nuclear testing has been established; 3. Satisfactory progress has been made in the adoption and implementation of genuine disarmament measures. Linking the cessation of hydrogen bomb testing with complex disarmament measures may lead to endless discussions. Haven't the disarmament negotiations of the past few years proved this point? In order to jump out of this dead end, the Soviet Union suggested separating the issue of stopping hydrogen bomb testing from the general issue of disarmament. It can be seen that the value of the so-called "continuing to suspend hydrogen bomb testing for one year" is questionable. Even "The Times" pointed out: The "genuine disarmament measures" mentioned in the British statement, "the authorities have not made a precise explanation." In addition, the "Manchester Guardian" also raised a question: "This proposal to hold immediate negotiations is held between the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Britain. France is left aside. China is also left out." How will international supervision be established? What position will Western countries place China in?

    The "Daily Telegraph" editorial on the U.S. and British statement used the title "Hydrogen Bomb Vacation." It cannot be said that this is very accurate and in accordance with the facts. It seems that the U.S. and Britain only intend to give the hydrogen bomb a short "vacation."

### 氢弹的休假

　　氢弹的休假
　　本报记者　潘非
    停止氢弹试验是全世界人民的迫切愿望。苏联早已在五个月之前就这样做了。8月22日晚，美英政府分别发表声明，宣布它们准备在10月31日起停止试验氢弹一年。
    当然，美英两国的声明如果能够实现，不能说这与继续进行无限制的试验没有任何区别。
    但是，美英政府的声明和全世界人民的愿望之间，还有极大的距离。对这个声明作一番客观的估价，是必要的。
    美英两国的停止试验氢弹并不是无条件的。它们声称，如果苏联在这一期间不恢复试验，并且开始了建立“有效的国际监督”的谈判（它们建议在10月31日于纽约和苏联举行会谈）之后，美英两国将停止试验氢弹一年。
    奇怪的是，在这个声明发表的同时，英国政府在太平洋圣诞岛开始了一系列的氢弹爆炸，同样地，根据英国报纸透露，在10月31日以前，美国将进行大规模的试验。
    为什么不能从今天开始立即停止试验氢弹呢？为什么在停止试验之前，还要急急忙忙地大干一场？这个道理，可以用“每日电讯报”的社论来说明。它写道：这是为了“在10月31日同苏联谈判之前，早已取得了这些试验的结果。”这个报纸的结论是：因而，停止试验氢弹对于英美来说，“并无损伤”。事实就是如此：美英停止试验氢弹的基础，是建立在已经开始和即将开始的大规模的试验之上的。这些大规模的试验给人类的安全带来多大的危害，似乎并不在美英政府的考虑之内。
    美英政府还宣布，在停试氢弹一年之后，如果一系列的先决条件能够实现的话，它们将继续停试一年。这些条件是：一、苏联继续不进行试验；二、停止核试验方面的国际监督制度有了满意的建立；三、真正的裁军措施的通过与执行有了满意的进展。把停止试验氢弹与复杂的裁军措施问题连在一起，就有可能流于无穷无尽的清谈。过去几年的裁军谈判，不是证明了这点吗？为了从这条死胡同里跳出来，苏联才建议把停试氢弹的问题和一般的裁军问题分开。由此可见，所谓“继续停试氢弹一年”这一诺言究竟有多大的价值，是值得怀疑的。即使“泰晤士报”也指出：英国声明中所说的“真正的裁军措施”究竟是什么涵义，“官方没有作确切的说明”。此外，“曼彻斯特卫报”还提出了一个问题：“这次立即进行谈判的建议是在苏美英之间举行的。法国被撇在一边。中国也留在外面。”国际监督将如何建立？要西方国家将把中国放在什么地位？
    “每日电讯报”关于美英声明的社论，用了“氢弹的休假”这样一个标题。不能不说这是十分确切，合乎事实的。看来，美英只打算让氢弹有一个短短的“假期”而已。
