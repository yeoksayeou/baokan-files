Xinhua News Agency, August 19th, TASS, New York, August 19th: The delegations of Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Liberia, Norway, Panama, and Paraguay, attending the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, have circulated a proposal that was in fact jointly drafted by the delegations of the United States, Britain, and Norway. However, for tactical considerations, the United States and Britain decided not to act as formal proposers themselves.

The proposal not only fails to demand the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, but does not even mention the issue of US and British troops at all. The proposal merely cites the statements made by the United States and Britain to the President of the General Assembly. The statements of the United States and Britain, which were distributed to the delegations at the same time as the proposal, reiterated their previous argument: the United States and Britain can only withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan "when the legitimately constituted governments request the withdrawal of troops... or when the United Nations takes further action and the presence of US and British troops is no longer necessary for other reasons." By citing this statement from the United States and Britain, the proposal actually recognizes the right of the aggressors to set conditions for withdrawal, agreeing to the stationing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan until the United States and Britain believe their conditions have been met. In other words, this proposal still leaves the issue of withdrawal to be resolved by the aggressors themselves.

One clause of the proposal asks that the member states of the United Nations not take any action that threatens the independence and sovereign integrity of any country or incites civil war. Judging from the context of the proposal, this clause is merely a repetition of the unfounded accusations against the United Arab Republic and indirectly defends the actions of the United States and Britain.

The proposal requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to consult with the governments concerned to take practical measures deemed necessary for Lebanon and Jordan. It can be seen from the next clause of the proposal that one of the "necessary measures" is the establishment of a United Nations police force euphemistically called the "United Nations Peace Force." Another clause requires the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue to study the economic development of Arab countries.

All recent activities of the United States delegation have been aimed at finding "proposers" and trying to gain support for this proposal. For this purpose, some have even released information saying that the proposal will be supported by India and accepted by the United Arab Republic. However, the representatives of India and the United Arab Republic have denied these rumors.

### 挪威等七国向联大提出提案　不谈撤军反为侵略者辩护

　　挪威等七国向联大提出提案
　　不谈撤军反为侵略者辩护
    新华社19日讯  塔斯社纽约19日讯：出席联合国大会紧急特别会议的加拿大、哥伦比亚、丹麦、利比里亚、挪威、巴拿马和巴拉圭代表团散发了一项提案，这个提案实际上是美英两国代表团同挪威代表团联合起草的。但是，美英两国出于策略考虑，决定自己不作为正式提案人。
    这个提案不仅没有提出美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的要求，而且根本没有提到美英军队的问题。这个提案仅仅是引用了美英两国向大会主席提出的声明而已，美英的声明和这个提案是同时散发给各代表团的。美英两国在它们的声明中，再次重复它们以前的这种论调：“只要合法组成的政府提出撤军的请求……或是联合国采取进一步行动和由于其他原因美英军队没有必要留驻的时候”，美英两国才能从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退军队。这项提案引用美英这个声明，实际上是承认侵略者有权提出撤军的条件，同意美英军队驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦，直到美英两国认为它们的条件已经实现时为止。换句话说，这个提案仍旧是把撤军的问题交由侵略者自己去解决。
    这个提案有一点要求联合国会员国不要采取威胁到任何国家独立和主权完整以及会挑起内战的行动。从提案的上下文来看，这一条款只不过是重复对阿拉伯联合共和国提出的毫无根据的责难并且为美英的行动间接辩解。
    提案要求联合国秘书长同有关政府磋商采取对黎巴嫩和约旦两国说来是必需的实际措施。从提案下一个条款可以看出，作为“必要措施”之一，是成立美其名为“联合国和平部队”的联合国警察部队。另一条款要求联合国秘书长继续研究阿拉伯国家经济发展问题。
    美国代表团近来的一切活动都是为了找寻“提案人”，并且设法使这个提案得到支持。为了这个目的甚至有人放空气说，这个提案将得到印度的支持，阿拉伯联合共和国也将接受。但是，印度和阿拉伯联合共和国的代表已经辟谣。
