Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 3rd: The Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO) Coking and Chemical Plant's No. 1 coke oven system project was fully completed on July 31st, one month ahead of schedule. The early completion of this plant, which supplies coke and gas to WISCO's various smelting systems, has created conditions for the early commissioning of WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace.

The WISCO Coking and Chemical Plant is China's newest coking plant. In this plant, coal will be comprehensively utilized. In addition to producing coke and gas for iron and steel smelting, it also utilizes the yellow smoke emitted during coking through a chemical recovery system to produce various benzene-based and tar-like basic chemical raw materials.

Its production process is highly mechanized and automated. From unloading coal and proportioning coal to sending well-coked coke to the blast furnace, belt conveyors are used for transportation. The belt conveyors have automatic safety devices that automatically stop the belt in the event of a malfunction.

    我国最新式的焦化厂
    武钢一号炼焦炉系统建成
    新华社武汉3日电　武钢炼焦化工厂一号炼焦炉系统工程在7月31日提前一个月全部建成。这座供应武钢各冶炼系统焦炭和煤气的工厂提前建成，为武钢一号高炉提前投入生产创造了条件。
    武钢炼焦化工厂是我国最新式的焦化厂。在这座工厂里煤将得到综合利用。它除了生产炼铁炼钢用的焦炭和煤气以外，还通过化学回收系统，利用炼焦冒出来的黄烟，生产各种苯类和焦油等化学基本原料。
    它的生产过程机械化、自动化程度很高。从卸煤、配煤直到炼好焦炭送往高炉，都采取皮带运输机运送；皮带运输机上有自动安全装置，遇到故障，皮带机会自动停住。
