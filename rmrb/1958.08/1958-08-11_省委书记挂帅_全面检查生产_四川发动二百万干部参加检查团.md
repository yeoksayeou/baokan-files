Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 10th - The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formed a provincial-wide industrial and agricultural production inspection team of two million cadres, who will go deep into the fields and factories to conduct a mass inspection of industrial and agricultural production throughout the province.

Li Dazhang, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Sichuan Province, is the General Director of the inspection team. Liao Zhigao and Chen Gang, Secretaries of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, are the Deputy General Directors. Provincial-level agencies have already dispatched more than 1,500 cadres to form four industrial production inspection teams and seventeen agricultural production inspection teams, which will depart one after another in the coming days to join forces with local cadres in various special districts, cities, and prefectures, and then comprehensively begin their work.

In order to ensure a great harvest and a large increase in production this year, and to prepare for an even greater leap forward next year, this major inspection will focus on the following aspects in agriculture: checking the management of rice seedling fields, the growth status of late autumn crops, grain storage, preparations for winter production (small spring crop production and basic construction), the improvement of agricultural tools, and the promotion of semi-mechanization. At the same time, it will also check the situation of eliminating the "seven pests" and promoting hygiene. In industry: focusing on steel production, it will check the construction and production of indigenous blast furnaces, investigate and study issues related to the development of steel production next year, as well as the current progress of light industry and basic construction in completing their plans.

After cadres at all levels of the inspection team join forces, they will be divided into several groups, adopting methods of key inspection, roving inspection, and mutual inspection, to promptly disseminate advanced experiences and attack weak links, so as to promote an all-round leap forward in production.
