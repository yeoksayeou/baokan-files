Xinhua News Agency, August 4th, Beirut News: Large numbers of American aggressor troops continue to invade Lebanon. The 2,200 American aggressor troops who landed in Beirut port on the 3rd belong to the 35th Tank Battalion of the U.S. Seventh Army stationed in West Germany. They brought more than 70 tanks. About 700 U.S. military vehicles transported to Beirut port by U.S. transport ships are also being landed in Beirut. In addition, transport planes of the U.S. aggressor air force continue to transport military supplies to Beirut International Airport.

A Reuters reporter reported from Beirut on the 3rd that the continued landing of large numbers of American aggressor troops in Lebanon will bring the number of American troops invading Lebanon to 15,000 by August 6.

U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock refused to answer the question of why the U.S. military continues to advance into Lebanon at a press conference held at the U.S. Embassy on the 2nd. He said that U.S. troops will continue to land in Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 3rd. "The Republic" published an editorial today condemning the United States for constantly landing troops in Lebanon.

The editorial said that the statements made by the United States about its intention to withdraw troops from Lebanon are inconsistent with its actual practice of constantly assembling military forces in Lebanon, which cannot help but make people suspect that the United States is about to launch another premeditated aggression in the Middle East.

The newspaper said that the true aggressive conspiracy of the United States has been exposed. All the people are on guard and will rise up to oppose this aggression.

"Al-Akhbar" published an editorial condemning the United States for continuing its aggression in Lebanon and sending more troops to support its occupying forces while delaying the summit conference.

    美侵略军继续增兵黎巴嫩
    开罗报纸揭露美国玩弄两面手法
    新华社4日讯　贝鲁特消息：大量美国侵略军继续侵入黎巴嫩。3日在贝鲁特港登陆的两千二百名美国侵略军属于驻在西德的美国第七军的第三十五坦克营，他们带来了七十多辆坦克，由美国运输舰运到贝鲁特港的约七百辆美国军用车辆，也正在贝鲁特登陆。另外，美国侵略空军的运输机继续把军用品运到贝鲁特的国际机场。
    路透社记者3日从贝鲁特发出的消息透露，大量美国侵略军队的继续在黎巴嫩登陆，到8月6日将使侵黎美军的人数达到一万五千名。
    美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克2日在美国大使馆举行的记者招待会上，拒绝回答美军为什么继续开进黎巴嫩的问题。他说，美国军队将继续在黎巴嫩登陆。
    新华社开罗3日电　“共和国报”今天发表社论谴责美国不断派军队在黎巴嫩登陆。
    社论说，美国所发表的关于它要从黎巴嫩撤退军队的谈话同它实际上不断在黎巴嫩集结军力的做法是互相矛盾的，这使人不禁疑心美国要在中东发动另一次预谋的侵略。
    这家报纸说，美国的真正侵略阴谋已经暴露了，所有人民都在戒备着，并且将起来反对这种侵略。
    “消息报”发表社论谴责美国在拖延政府首脑会议的同时，继续在黎巴嫩进行侵略，并且增派军队支援它的占领军。
