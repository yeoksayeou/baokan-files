    The Nanchang Uprising, which took place thirty-one years ago, raised the red flag of persistent revolutionary struggle and has great significance in the history of the Chinese revolution.

    The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." This valuable experience was gained through long-term struggle and the lessons of bloodshed. Our Party established the Military Affairs Department as early as 1923, sending people to the Whampoa Military Academy to study, to serve as instructors, and to work in the then National Revolutionary Army, and led independent regiments and other troops during the Northern Expedition. However, our Party's independent establishment of an army and command of military operations began with the Nanchang Uprising.

    Looking back to the spring and summer of 1927, in the later period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, due to the betrayal of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, a sudden attack was launched against the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. In such a critical situation, the right-leaning opportunist line, then represented by Chen Duxiu in the Chinese Communist Party, dared not boldly mobilize the masses for struggle, dared not resolutely promote the development of the revolutionary movement, and dared not arm the workers and peasants to fight back against the attacks of counter-revolutionaries. However, Comrade Mao Zedong at that time strongly advocated boldly mobilizing and arming the worker and peasant masses. The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising declared the bankruptcy of the right-leaning opportunist line. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, armed themselves, giving a powerful counterattack to the betrayal of the Kuomintang reactionaries who surrendered to imperialism, raised the bright banner of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, and resolutely carried out armed struggle.

    Although the Nanchang Uprising raised the red flag of armed struggle and the establishment of a revolutionary army, questions remained: What kind of army should be established? How to transform the old army? How to build a revolutionary army? How to create revolutionary base areas and lead revolutionary warfare? These questions were not resolved at that time. Although the uprising was a victory, with more than 30,000 troops taking resolute action under the leadership of the Party, eliminating more than three enemy divisions in one night and seizing over 10,000 guns, giving the Kuomintang reactionaries a head-on blow. And the troops also won several victories on the way south, but ultimately it failed. The reasons for the failure, in addition to the political line, were errors in the military line and the error of a purely military viewpoint. At that time, the peasant movements in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were very high. The uprising army should have combined with the peasant movements in Hunan and Jiangxi, created revolutionary base areas, and persisted in long-term guerrilla warfare, thereby strengthening itself and eliminating the enemy. However, at that time, our thinking of relying on the masses, carrying out long-term guerrilla warfare, and creating revolutionary base areas was not clear. Instead, we placed our hopes on going south, opening up the coast, and restoring the revolutionary base areas in Guangdong, attempting to launch another Northern Expedition. We always intended to solve problems purely from a military perspective, always wanting to rely on foreign aid, rather than relying on mobilizing the masses. In the long march south, there was also a lack of specific action guidelines, the advance into Fujian delayed the time, and after entering Guangdong, the forces were dispersed. The troops themselves had not established revolutionary political work, political education was very poor, the Party's leadership was very weak, and the army had not been transformed. Coupled with the objective strength of the enemy and the lack of subjective guidance experience. Therefore, the Nanchang Uprising troops failed in eastern Guangdong. The remaining forces, later under the leadership of Comrade Zhu De, joined forces with the worker-peasant armed forces of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan, and formally established the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

    After the "August 7th" Conference, Comrade Mao Zedong led peasants, workers, and a part of the Northern Expedition Army in an uprising in the areas around western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan, which was the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising. A worker-peasant revolutionary army was established during the uprising. Initially, the composition of this army was relatively complex, so the warlordist thinking of the old army and the scattered habits of the peasants were very serious. At the same time, it suffered several setbacks in the face of superior enemies, with heavy casualties. However, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, this army underwent reorganization, established Party leadership, and adopted methods of mobilizing the masses and promoting democracy, changing all the bad systems and styles of the old warlord army, and establishing new-type internal and external relationships of "officers and soldiers as one" and "army and people as one." Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, this army thoroughly opposed the purely military line, closely coordinating military struggle with political struggle. It began to carry out land revolution, create rural revolutionary base areas, and establish revolutionary power. All of this was the result of Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applying Marxism-Leninism based on China's specific conditions. The failure of the army after the Nanchang Uprising was precisely the result of not finding such a correct path and committing the error of a purely military viewpoint line.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking on army building and combat gradually formed in the practice of leading the army of the Autumn Harvest Uprising; after the Jinggangshan meeting, it further developed in actual struggle in the Fourth Red Army led by Comrade Mao Zedong. "The Struggle in Jinggangshan," the resolution of the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army, is precisely a summary of Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking on army building and combat principles. At that time, in the struggle against various non-proletarian erroneous thoughts and erroneous military lines existing within the Red Army Party, Comrade Mao Zedong formed a complete and correct military line. He clearly proposed: the revolutionary army must combine with the peasant movement. Implement land revolution to mobilize the broad masses of peasants and create revolutionary base areas. Persist in long-term guerrilla warfare to surround the cities from the revolutionary countryside, and finally seize the cities. In army building, a completely new type of people's army must be established, with the absolute leadership of the Party, strong political work, a democratic style, a mass line, and strict mass discipline. The thoughts, styles, and systems of the old army must be thoroughly transformed. In the guidance of war, flexible strategies and tactics must be implemented. The army is both a fighting force and a working force, dividing its forces to mobilize the masses in peacetime, and concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one in wartime. This is the correct line guiding the Chinese revolutionary war. Implementing this line enabled our army to be completely established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and eliminate the influence of all old-style armies. For more than 30 years, our army has implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's army building line and combat principles, and has built our army into a completely new type of people's army, victoriously carrying out the great people's war.

    南昌起义与我军建设
    ——庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十一周年
    中华人民共和国元帅　贺龙
    三十一年前的南昌起义，高举起坚持革命斗争的红旗，在中国革命历史上有着伟大的意义。
    中国革命的特点是“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”。毛泽东同志指出：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”这个宝贵的经验，是经过长期的斗争和流血的教训才取得的。我党在1923年就建立了军事工作部，派人到黄埔军校去学习，去当教官，到当时的国民革命军中去工作，并且在北伐战争中领导了独立团等部队。但是，我党独立地建立军队和指挥军队作战，是从南昌起义才开始的。
    回想1927年春夏之交，第一次国内革命战争的后期，由于大地主大资产阶级的代表蒋介石国民党的叛变，向中国共产党和中国人民来了一个突然袭击。在这样的紧急关头，当时中国共产党以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义路线，不敢放手发动群众的斗争，不敢坚决推进革命运动的发展，不敢武装工农去回击反革命分子的进攻。而毛泽东同志，当时是极力主张放手发动和武装工农群众的。“八一”南昌起义，宣告了右倾机会主义路线的破产。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下武装起来，给予投降帝国主义的国民党反动派的叛变以有力的反击，高举起中国革命斗争鲜明的旗帜，坚决进行武装斗争。
    南昌起义虽然打起了武装斗争和建立革命军队的红旗。但是，要建立一支什么样的军队？如何改造旧军队？怎样建设革命的军队？怎样创造革命根据地与领导革命战争？这些问题当时是没有解决的。起义虽然是胜利了，三万多军队在党的领导下，采取了坚决的行动，一个晚上就解决敌人三个多师，缴枪万余枝，给国民党反动派迎头一棒。而且部队在南下途中也打了几个胜仗，但是最后还是失败了。失败的原因除政治路线外，就是由于军事路线的错误，单纯军事观点的错误。当时的两湖、江西的农民运动是很高涨的，起义的军队应当与湖南、江西的农民运动相结合，创造革命根据地，坚持长期的游击战争，从而壮大自己，消灭敌人。但是当时我们依靠人民群众、进行长期的游击战争、创造革命根据地的思想，是不明确的。而是把出路寄托于南下，打开海口，恢复广东革命根据地，试图再来一次北伐。总是打算单纯从军事着眼去解决问题，总想依靠外援，不是依靠发动群众。而在南下长途的进军中，又缺乏具体行动的方针，进军福建拖延了时间，进入广东以后又分散了兵力。部队本身没有建立革命的政治工作，政治教育很差，党的领导很薄弱，军队又没有改造。加上客观上敌人的力量强大，而主观上的指导又缺乏经验。因此，南昌起义的部队在广东东部失败了。剩下一部分力量后来在朱德同志率领下，与毛主席所领导的秋收起义的工农武装在井冈山会师，才正式成立了中国工农红军。
    毛泽东同志在“八七”会议之后，在赣西与湘东一带地区领导农民、工人和北伐军的一部举行了起义，这就是有名的秋收起义。在起义中成立了一支工农革命军。开始时这支军队的成分较为复杂，所以旧军队军阀主义的思想和农民散漫的习气是很严重的。同时，在优势敌人面前遭受了几次挫折，伤亡很大。但是这支军队在毛泽东同志领导之下，进行了整编，建立了党的领导；采取发动群众、发扬民主的方法，改变了旧的军阀军队的一切不良制度和作风，建立起“官兵一致”、“军民一致”的军队内部和外部新型的关系。这支军队在毛泽东同志的领导下，彻底地反对了单纯军事路线，以军事斗争紧密地配合政治斗争。开始进行土地革命，创造农村革命根据地、建立革命政权。这一切，都是毛泽东同志根据中国具体情况创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的成果。南昌起义后军队的失败，正是没有找到这样一条正确道路，而犯了单纯军事观点错误路线的结果。
    毛泽东同志的建军思想和作战思想，在领导秋收起义这支军队的实践中逐步形成；井冈山会师以后，在毛泽东同志领导的红四军中，更在实际斗争中有了发展。“井冈山的斗争”，红四军第九次党代表大会的决议，正是毛泽东同志建军思想和作战原则的概括。毛泽东同志当时在和红军党内存在着的各种非无产阶级的错误思想和错误的军事路线进行的斗争中，形成了一条完整的正确的军事路线。他明确地提出了：革命军队必须与农民运动相结合。实行土地革命，以发动广大农民群众，创造革命根据地。坚持长期的游击战争，以革命的农村包围城市，而最后夺取城市。在军队建设上，要建立一支完全新型的人民军队，有党的绝对领导，有坚强的政治工作，有民主作风、群众路线和严格的群众纪律。旧军队的思想、作风、制度必须彻底改造。在战争的指导上，必须实行灵活的战略战术。军队是战斗队，又是工作队，平时分兵以发动群众，战时集中优势兵力各个歼灭敌人。这是指导中国革命战争的正确路线。执行这一路线就可使我军完全建立在马克思列宁主义的基础之上，并肃清一切旧式军队的影响。三十多年来，我们的军队贯彻执行了毛泽东同志的建军路线和作战原则，便把我军建设成为一支完全新型的人民军队，胜利地进行了伟大的人民战争。
