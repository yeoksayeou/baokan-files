Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 13th: The Jakarta Military Tribunal sentenced three criminals who had attempted to assassinate President Sukarno to death today at noon, and another was sentenced to twenty years in prison.

The three defendants sentenced to death were Yusuf Ismail, Satun bin Muhammad, and Tasrif bin Hussein. On the night of November 30 last year, they threw five grenades in front of the Tjikini School in Jakarta, attempting to kill President Sukarno, killing nine people and permanently disabling forty-five people, including many women and children. President Sukarno was unharmed under the protection of his guards. The fourth defendant, Taslim bin Abubakar, was sentenced to twenty years in prison. He had hidden the grenades and guns used by the aforementioned criminals.

Chief Military Judge Lieutenant Colonel Gunawan pointed out in the sentence that if the defendants were not satisfied, they could appeal to the Supreme Military Tribunal within seven days.

The conspiracy to assassinate President Sukarno was part of a conspiracy by the rebel group headed by former Army Deputy Chief of Staff Lubis to overthrow the Indonesian government. Military prosecutors pointed out that these criminals used weapons or other brutal means in an attempt to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia, change the form of government, and establish a federal "Islamic State." These criminals all participated in the "Anti-Communist Movement" or "Lubis Movement" led by the rebel Lubis. This rebel organization had thrown grenades at the headquarters of the Indonesian Communist Party, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, and other places. This rebel organization also conspired to assassinate the Army Chief of Staff and some government ministers.

The trial of this case began on April 28 this year. The above-mentioned criminals confessed to their crimes. The military tribunal also heard testimony from twenty other criminals. They had also participated in the "Anti-Communist Movement" and were implicated in the conspiracy to assassinate President Sukarno. They appeared in court as witnesses, confessing that their criminal activities were related to the two separatist groups at the time, namely the "Wild Bull Council" in Central Sumatra and the "Eagle Council" in South Sumatra, and were supported by prominent figures of the Masyumi Party, such as Burhanuddin Harahap, who was engaged in legal activities at the time. Later, Harahap fled to West Sumatra to join the rebellion.

News has it that the military tribunal will soon try other criminals related to the Tjikini case.

　　雅加达军事法庭
　　判决谋刺苏加诺的罪犯
    新华社雅加达13日电　雅加达军事法庭今天中午判处三名曾经谋刺苏加诺总统的罪犯以死刑，另一名被判处二十年徒刑。
    被判处死刑的三名被告是：优素福·伊斯梅尔、萨顿·本·穆罕默德和塔斯里夫·本·侯赛尼。去年11月30日夜间，他们在雅加达芝基尼学校门前投掷了五枚手榴弹，企图杀害苏加诺总统，在场群众九人被炸死，四十五人终身残废，其中包括许多妇女和儿童。苏加诺总统在卫士的保护下没有受伤。第四名被告塔斯里姆·本·阿布巴克尔被判处二十年徒刑。他曾经暗藏上述罪犯所使用的手榴弹和枪枝。
    首席军事法官贡纳万中校在宣判时指出，被告如果不服，可以在七天内向最高军事法庭提出上诉。
    阴谋行刺苏加诺总统的行动是以前陆军副参谋长卢比斯为首的叛乱集团企图推翻印度尼西亚政府的阴谋的一环。军事检察官指出，这些罪犯使用了武器或其他残暴手段，企图推翻印度尼西亚共和国，改变国体，建立联邦式“伊斯兰教国”的目的。这些罪犯全都参加了叛乱分子卢比斯所领导的“反共运动”，或“卢比斯运动”。这个叛乱组织曾经向印度尼西亚共产党总部、全印度尼西亚中央职工会等地投掷手榴弹。这个叛乱组织还曾经阴谋刺杀陆军参谋长和一些政府部长。
    这个案件的审讯工作是从今年4月28日开始的。上述几名罪犯承认了他们的罪行。军事法庭还听取了其他二十名罪犯的证词。他们也参加过“反共运动”，并且同谋刺苏加诺总统的案件有牵连。他们以证人身份到庭，供认他们的犯罪活动同当时的两个分裂活动集团即中苏门答腊的“雄牛师委员会”和南苏门答腊的“鹰委员会”有联系，并且得到当时从事合法活动的马斯友美党著名人物伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普等人的支持。后来，哈拉哈普逃到西苏门答腊去参加叛乱。
    有消息说，军事法庭不久将审讯同芝基尼案件有关的其他罪犯。
