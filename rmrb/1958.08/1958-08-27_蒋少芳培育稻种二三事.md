　　Two or Three Things About Jiang Shaofang Cultivating Rice Seeds

　　The process of Jiang Shaofang cultivating superior seeds illustrates that every scientific achievement is not easily attained. The realization of each of his ideals is the result of active and arduous effort. For example, he succeeded in cultivating the "Corn Rice" superior variety after sixty-three experiments. In the past, it was generally believed that monocotyledonous plants, especially gramineous plants, did not have a cambium and could not be grafted. He doubted this claim and insisted on verifying it in practice. However, after sixty-two consecutive grafts, the rootstock withered, and the scion died. During this process, some people ridiculed him for making useless attempts, and he also wavered. But he thought, if other plants can be grafted, why can't corn rice be grafted? He said that people's knowledge and experience are always accumulated bit by bit, like bees collecting honey. So he cheered up and continued his research. At the same time, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch constantly encouraged him, which increased his confidence and courage. He summarized the experience of previous failures, read a lot of agricultural science books, and often read until late at night. Then he carefully studied the characteristics of rice, the rules of growth and development, the structure of rice stems, the tillering process, and other issues, and consulted books, school teachers, and experienced farmers about problems he couldn't understand. In this way, he finally found a new approach, changing the original grafting of rice seedlings onto the growing point of corn to grafting at the basal stem node, and finally succeeded in the sixty-third grafting, obtaining the first generation of "Corn Rice" hybrid new varieties. He created the experience of grafting monocotyledonous plants and using "distant hybridization" to cultivate superior varieties.
　　
　　Jiang Shaofang overcame the difficulty of lacking instruments and equipment in his research process. Initially, when he was conducting sexual hybridization, he needed to use a brush to transfer pollen, but he had no money to buy a brush and was unable to work for several days. Once, when he was observing the growth characteristics of rice, he saw the wind blowing the rice and suddenly thought that he could use wind power to pollinate. He tried using a rice stalk, dipping one end in pollen, and blowing on the other end with his mouth, so that the pollen was sent to the stigma of the pistil. At the same time as this experiment, he needed to calculate the time, but he did not have a clock. While hesitating, he heard the school bell ring. The bell inspired him that the break time between school classes was ten minutes, which exactly met the requirements of his experiment. So he used the ten minutes between classes to calculate the time of the experiment, solving the difficulty of lacking a clock.

　　Jiang Shaofang is now writing a book about his breeding experience. His experimental sexual and asexual hybridization of plants has expanded to more than 200 species, including, in addition to superior rice varieties, "Sorghum Corn," "Multi-Ear Corn," and castor beans hybridized from temperate and tropical castor beans.

　　蒋少芳培育稻种二三事
    蒋少芳培育良种的过程，说明了每一个科学成就不是轻而易举的。他的每一个理想的实现，都是经过了积极的艰苦努力的结果。例如他培育“玉米水稻”良种，是经过六十三次试验才成功的。过去一般人认为单子叶植物，特别是禾本科植物没有形成层，不能嫁接。他怀疑这种说法，一定要在实践中来加以证实。可是一连嫁接了六十二次，还是砧木枯萎，接穗死去。在这过程中，曾经有人讥笑他作无用的尝试，他也曾动摇过。但他想别的植物可以嫁接，难道玉米水稻就真的不能嫁接吗？他说，人的知识与经验，总是像蜜蜂采蜜那样的点滴积累起来的。于是他振作起来继续研究，同时，中共党支部书记也不断地鼓励他，增加了他的信心和勇气。他总结了历次失败的经验，翻阅了很多农业科学书籍，常常阅读到深夜。然后细心地研究水稻的特性、生长发育规律、稻茎结构、分蘖程序等问题，想不通的问题再向书本、学校的教师和老农请教。这样，他终于找出了一条新途径，把水稻秧苗由原来嫁接在玉米的生长点上，改为嫁接在基部茎节处，终于在第六十三次嫁接成功，获得了第一代“玉米水稻”杂交新品种。创造了单子叶植物嫁接和应用“远缘杂交”培育良种的经验。
    蒋少芳在研究过程中克服了没有仪器设备的困难。起初他在进行有性杂交时，需要用毛笔来传授花粉，但他无钱买毛笔，好几天没能进行工作。有一次，正当他在观察水稻生长的特性时，看见风吹动了水稻，突然联想到可以利用风力来传粉，他就试用一根水稻秆，一头蘸花粉，用嘴在另一头吹，这样就把花粉送到雌花柱头上了。在这个实验的同时需要计算时间，但他没有时钟，在犹豫之中听到学校的钟声响。这钟声启发了他，学校上下课之间的休息时间是十分钟，正符合他试验的要求，于是就利用上下课之间的十分钟来计算试验的时间，解决了缺钟的困难。
    蒋少芳现在正将他的育种经验，写成一本书。他试验的植物有性杂交和无性杂交已发展到二百多种，其中除水稻良种外，有“高粱玉米”、“多穗玉米”、温带蓖麻和热带蓖麻杂交的蓖麻等。
