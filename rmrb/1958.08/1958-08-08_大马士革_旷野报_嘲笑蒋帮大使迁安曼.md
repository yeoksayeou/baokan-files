Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 7th: "Al Ayyam" ridiculed the Chiang Kai-shek group's "embassy" moving from Baghdad to Amman after being expelled by the government of the Republic of Iraq, saying, now that the Sa'id of Iraq is in his grave, what can the Chiang Kai-shek elements hope to gain by staying in Baghdad?

The newspaper quoted an Arab poem to describe the plight of the Chiang Kai-shek elements: "Baghdad is neither my residence nor my camel's stable, so why stay in Baghdad? Far from home, living alone in a foreign land, empty-handed, like a sword with a broken hilt, what is the point?"

The newspaper said, what hope can the Chiang Kai-shek elements have in Baghdad? Let him go to Amman! There he will meet the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. There, Taiwan and Amman, purpose and purpose, hope and hope, dream and dream will be in tune with each other.

The newspaper sarcastically asked, but why should Chiang Kai-shek worry? Isn't the United States with him? And why should Hussein worry? Isn't the United Kingdom with him? Isn't Chiang Kai-shek taking this step of moving the "embassy" from Baghdad to Amman a "bold" action taken to achieve "goals" and realize "dreams"?

    大马士革“旷野报”
    嘲笑蒋帮大使迁安曼
    新华社大马士革7日电  “旷野报”在评论蒋介石集团的“大使馆”在被伊拉克共和国政府赶走之后从巴格达迁往安曼的时候说，现在伊拉克的赛义德已经进了坟墓了，蒋介石分子还呆在巴格达能希望得到什么呢？
    这家报纸引阿拉伯的诗篇描绘蒋介石分子的窘境说：“巴格达既不是我的住处，又不是我的骆驼的厩房，为什么还呆在巴格达呢？远离家乡，独居异地，双手空空，像剑柄坏了的宝剑，这又何苦呢？”
    这家报纸说，蒋介石分子在巴格达还能有什么希望呢？让他到安曼去吧！在那里他将同约旦哈希姆王国相遇。在那里，台湾和安曼、目的和目的、希望和希望、梦想和梦想都将相投。
    这家报纸讥讽地问道，但是蒋介石何必操心呢？美国不是和他在一起吗？侯赛因又何必操心呢？联合王国不是和他一起吗？蒋介石采取这个把“大使馆”从巴格达移往安曼的步骤不是为了达到“目的”、实现“梦想”而采取的“大胆”行动吗？
