Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: According to TASS, Bangkok, August 4th: Thai newspapers published a conversation with Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the former Lao Fighting Forces. Speaking of the Laotian government crisis, he said that the main obstacle to a rapid resolution of this crisis is foreign interference, especially by the United States, whose purpose is to prevent the formation of a coalition government with representatives of the Lao Patriotic Party, led by him, which advocates an independent and neutral foreign policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 4th: According to a Polish Press Agency report on the 2nd, the Canadian and Indian representatives of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos decided on July 19th, despite the objections of the Polish delegation, to suspend the activities of the commission indefinitely.

The Polish representative to the commission has long opposed the Canadian delegation's attempts to completely abolish the commission and has issued statements protesting the decision to suspend the commission's activities indefinitely, as this is an action that effectively dissolves the commission.

The International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos was established in accordance with the Geneva Agreement of July 1954 on the cessation of hostilities in Laos.

In view of the recent decision to suspend the commission's activities, which creates the danger of exacerbating tensions in this part of Asia, the Polish delegation protests this decision and emphasizes that the countries that helped pass this decision must be held responsible for the situation created.

In view of the fact that the Canadian and Indian delegations left Laos a few days after passing the decision to suspend the commission's activities and disbanding the commission's secretariat and affiliated bodies, the Polish delegation was also forced to leave Laos.

    苏发努冯指责美国干涉老挝内政
    波方抗议停止老挝国际委员会活动的决定
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社曼谷4日讯：泰国报纸刊登了老挝前寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王的谈话。他在谈到老挝政府危机的问题时说，迅速解决这个危机的主要障碍是外国的干涉，特别是美国的干涉，其目的是不让组织有由他领导的主张实行独立的中立外交政策的老挝爱国党代表参加的联合政府。
    新华社华沙4日电　据波兰通讯社在2日报道说，老挝国际监督和监察委员会的加拿大代表和印度代表在7月19日不顾波兰代表团的意见而决定无限期地停止委员会的活动。
    委员会的波兰代表长期以来一直反对加拿大代表团为完全取消委员会而作的尝试，并且曾提出声明，抗议无限期地停止委员会活动的决定，因为这是使委员会在实际上解散的行动。
    老挝国际监督和监察委员会是根据1954年7月签订的停止老挝境内的敌对行动的日内瓦协议成立的。
    鉴于最近关于停止委员会活动的决定，造成了加剧亚洲这部分地区的紧张局势的危险，波兰代表团抗议这个决定，并且强调指出，帮助通过这个决定的国家必须对于造成的这种局势负责。
    鉴于加拿大和印度代表团在通过了停止委员会活动的决定和解散了委员会秘书处和附属机构后几天就离开了老挝，波兰代表团也被迫离开老挝。
