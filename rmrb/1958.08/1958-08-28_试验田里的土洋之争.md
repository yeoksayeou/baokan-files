　　The "Native" vs. "Foreign" Dispute in the Experimental Fields
　　By Our Correspondent　Shi Yue'e
    This year, the eleven mu of double-cropping early rice experimental fields cultivated by the East China Agricultural Science Institute suffered an unexpected failure. The harvest result was an average yield of 872 jin per mu, and the highest-yielding mu was only 908.7 jin. The average total number of grains per ear was only 43.71, of which only 27.4 were full grains, and the rest were green grains, empty husks, and blank husks. This record, created single-handedly by the experts, pales in comparison to the high-yield "satellites" launched by the peasants of the Jian'guo No. 1 Cooperative in Macheng, Hubei. It even lags far behind many ordinary agricultural production cooperatives in this province.

    Is the low yield of rice cultivated by agricultural science research institutions due to poor conditions? No. The material conditions for production here are excellent. The fertilizer in the high-yield fields is not only abundant and of good quality, but also analyzed and matched according to strict scientific standards. Irrigation is convenient; water can be supplied or drained as needed. If crops encounter pests or diseases, any necessary agents can be sprayed immediately. Other aspects, such as farming tools, are also readily available. It can be said that their material conditions are the best in the country.

    Is it due to insufficient technical strength? The technical guidance for the experimental fields was provided by Wu Kaizhi, an expert with more than 20 years of experience in rice research. In the experimental process, they also gathered authorities from the institute in various fields such as rice varieties, plant protection, physiology, and soil. What agricultural cooperative can compare with such strong technical strength?

　　Clinging to Books, Making Gestures　Scholars Farming Will Never Yield a Harvest
    So, what is the reason after all? The farm workers who participated in the actual operation of the high-yield fields see it very clearly. They discussed behind the experts' backs, saying, "This is 'scholars farming,' and it will never yield a harvest," and "Don't think those old experts look so important; what they have in their heads is like the props of a rural opera troupe—all old stuff." These humorous words incisively reveal the essence of the problem.

    In early March, the early rice high-yield experiment began. What variety should be selected? The working group held a special meeting to discuss this issue. Comrades from the Provincial Department of Agriculture suggested choosing between the "Gong 17" and "Qingsong 5" varieties. These two varieties are superior strains introduced from the Northeast in previous years, with large ears, thick stalks, and a maturity period about seven days earlier than ordinary early rice, meeting the high-yield requirements of being lodging-resistant and having an early maturity. However, this suggestion was strongly opposed by Yu Lüqi, the only variety selection expert in the institute, who talked eloquently about the lessons learned from the failure of Zhejiang Province to introduce the above two varieties several years ago. Someone asked, "Mr. Yu, didn't you personally participate in selecting and breeding these two varieties? Was the result good or bad?" He still confidently said, "The materials selected and bred by others have a basis. We should believe in science." What was the actual situation? Zhejiang had long since restored the reputation of the above two varieties. Their experimental results proved that the previous introduction failure was not due to the variety being bad but to improper cultivation. However, this variety selection expert only knew one thing but not the other. He still regarded things that people had already denied as treasures. He did not even dare to trust the superior strains he had personally selected and bred. As a result, they had to switch to the "Awning Early Rice" variety from within the province.

    Rice paddies need heavy fertilization. This is a key to increasing production that has long been proven by countless farmers' practices. Many agricultural cooperatives have long grasped this principle and accumulated a lot of experience. However, experts buried in piles of books cannot understand it. The old rice expert Wu Kaizhi has always opposed heavy fertilization. He always stubbornly clings to the principle of the "three elements" of fertilizer, fearing that if fertilization goes beyond the framework of the "three elements," it will cause the rice to lodge and delay the time. He refused to implement measures of heavy fertilization. You Demin, from the soil science department who studies soil and fertilizer, was the same. He was terrified when he saw the fertilization plan for the experimental fields. Applying 2,000 jin of green manure, 300 dan of pond mud, and 100 dan of compost per mu was unheard of! He could not find such a record in all the agricultural science books. At this time, most of the fertilizer had already been applied to the fields, so Yu Demin, as a soil and fertilizer expert, proposed the absurd measure of "washing the fields with water" to wash away the fertilizer.

    Because the land was not prepared well, the mud in the seedling fields sank to the knees. When transplanting seedlings, the field was full of people, transplanting seedlings, transporting seedlings, checking quality, and pulling ropes. Nearly a hundred people were coming and going in one mu of land, and the field was full of footprints. Many skilled seedling transplanters could not grasp the quality of transplanting this year. If they transplanted too shallowly, the seedlings would not stand firmly. If they transplanted firmly, they would sink in. General agricultural cooperatives only transplant to a depth of two inches at most, but they required transplanting to three inches, and the deepest were five inches. At this time, everyone felt very difficult and asked the experts to find a solution, but those experts just stood on the ridges, making gestures and constantly complaining that the workers' seedling transplanting skills were not good. The workers angrily held out their fingers and said, "Putting a finger in is only two inches deep at most. Please come down and stand and you will know the reason." Even when technical guidance was most needed, not a single expert was willing to take off their shoes and socks and go down to the ground. Of course, they could not come up with any effective measures.

　　Starting from Reality, Taking Off Shoes and Going to the Fields　Native Experts Revive Dying Rice
    After the seedlings were transplanted, they were always yellow and unwilling to grow. At this time, it was urgently necessary to make a decisive decision, start from reality, and change cultivation measures and field management methods. Xue Zenghai and Wang Jinbao, two production experts from agricultural cooperatives, were extremely worried when they saw the half-dead seedlings. According to their experience, the first field management must be carried out half a month after the seedlings are transplanted. They repeatedly raised their opinions to Wu Kaizhi by the fields, asking him to take measures as soon as possible, but Wu Kaizhi kept mumbling. He said, "The books say it clearly that you cannot manage them until they are growing." But Xue Zenghai and Wang Jinbao's views were exactly the opposite of his. They said, "In the case of seedlings not growing for a long time, early management can promote seedling growth." However, their practical experience, which was very much in line with scientific principles, failed to move Wu Kaizhi, whose mind was clouded by books. The management time was delayed again and again, lasting as long as thirty-one days. The two production experts felt as if their hearts were being cut by a knife as they watched the yellow, sickly seedlings.

    Because the management was too late, the seedlings began to differentiate, losing the opportunity to "bake" the fields (i.e., dry the fields for sunlight). At that time, Wu Kaizhi repeatedly emphasized the theory in the books, believing that the fields must not be baked after differentiation, and that not baking the fields could help win tillering. Production expert Xue Zenghai firmly advocated baking the fields. Based on the field conditions at the time and his own production experience, he argued with the foreign experts again and again. He said: The differentiation period of early rice generally lasts for a week, and differentiation and tillering are always carried out at the same time. If we mechanically believe that the fields cannot be baked after differentiation, then it is impossible to bake the fields under any circumstances. If we seize the opportunity to bake the fields for three days in the early stage of differentiation, it will not only not affect tillering, but also promote tillering. However, as a result of the debate, the foreign experts used the authority of the books to overwhelm Xue Zenghai's valuable practical experience. His correct suggestions, which were completely in line with the actual situation, were dismissed with the accusation of "no scientific basis."

    Under this adverse current, Xue Zenghai and Wang Jinbao were very distressed. They watched helplessly as the crops they had cultivated were wasted in vain. However, they were not discouraged and continued to actively make suggestions, asking to be allowed to carry out a "grasping rice" to make a final effort to save the rice. However, the "grasping rice" technique was a tradition in their hometown, and no one at the Agricultural Science Institute knew how to do it. Xue Zenghai and Wang Jinbao took over the "grasping rice" task for the eleven mu of fields. In the scorching sun, they squatted in the rice clumps all day long, ignoring insect bites and the sweltering heat, grasping each rice stalk, one plant at a time, removing weeds, and pinching mud clumps. They personally sorted out every rice stalk in the eleven mu of land. The two of them worked for five consecutive days before crawling out of the rice clumps, so tired that they could barely walk. After their careful care, the color of the rice quickly turned green, and the development was relatively normal. Many workers who participated in the experimental field operations were deeply moved by their spirit, and even those stubborn foreign experts had to admit that the effect of this "grasping rice" was beyond their expectations.

    Who is the expert and who is the layman? Who is the real expert and who is the empty expert? Harsh reality has drawn a clear conclusion. Recently, at a meeting to summarize early rice production, someone sharply questioned those foreign experts: "In the early rice experiment, have you ever personally cultivated a seedling? Have you ever harvested a rice plant? How many practical problems have you solved for the high-yield experimental fields?" Experts, how should you answer these questions? (Attached picture)

　　试验田里的土洋之争
　　本报记者　史越峨
    今年，华东农业科学研究所培植的十一亩双季早稻试验田，遭受了意外的失败。收割结果，平均亩产八百七十二斤，产量最高的一亩田也只有九百零八点七斤。每穗总粒数平均只有四十三点七一粒，其中饱满粒数只有二十七点四粒，其他都是青粒，瘪壳，空壳。这个由专家们一手创造的纪录，和湖北麻城建国一社农民们放出的高产卫星相比较，真是相距太大了，如果和本省许多普通的农业生产合作社比较，也远远地落在农民的后面。
    农业科学研究机关栽培的水稻，产量如此之低，是条件不好吗？不是的。他们这里的生产物质条件十分优异，丰产田里的肥料不仅是数量多，质量好，而且都是经过化验分析，按照严格的科学标准搭配的。农田灌溉要水就灌，要干就排，十分方便。如果作物遇到病虫灾害，需要什么药剂就可以立即喷洒。其他在耕作工具方面也是应有尽有。可以说他们的物质条件是全国第一流的。
    是技术力量不足吗？负责试验田技术指导的，是一位从事水稻研究工作有二十多年历史的专家吴闓直。在试验过程中，他们还集中了所内有关水稻品种、植保、生理、土壤等各方面的权威人士。像这样雄厚的技术力量，哪一个农业社能比得上？
　　死抱住书本，指手划脚  秀才种田，一辈子收不成
    那么，原因到底在哪里呢？参加丰产田实际操作的农场工人们看得很透彻，他们在背后议论说：“这叫秀才种田，一辈子收不成”，“别看那些老专家像煞有介事，他们头脑里装的，就好像咱们农村里唱草台戏的行头，全是旧的”。这几句饶有风趣的话，锋利地道破了问题的实质。
    3月初，早稻丰产试验工作开始了，究竟选用什么品种合适呢？工作组专门开会讨论这个问题，省农业厅有关同志建议在“公十七号”和“青松五号”两个品种中选择一个。这两个品种是前几年从东北引进的良种，穗大、秆粗、成熟期比一般早稻提前七天左右，符合不倒伏、成熟期早等丰产条件。可是，这个意见却遭到了所内唯一的选种专家俞履圻的坚决反对，振振有词地大谈几年以前浙江引用以上两个品种失败的教训。有人问：“俞先生，你不是亲自参加选育这两个品种的吗？结果是好是坏呢？”他还是理直气壮地说：“人家选育的材料有根有据，我们应该相信科学。”实际情况怎样呢？浙江早已为以上两个品种恢复了名誉，他们试验的结果，证明以前引种失败，不是品种不好，而是栽培不当。但这位选种专家只知其一，不知其二，人家早已否定了的东西，他还如获至宝。甚至连他自己经手选育过的良种也不敢信任。结果，不得不改用了省内的“有芒早稻”。
    水稻田需要重施肥，这是早就为农民无数次实践所证明了的增产关键，许多农业社早就掌握了这个原理，而且积累了不少经验。可是埋头在书本堆里的专家们，却无法理解。老水稻专家吴闓直是一贯反对重施肥的。他总是死啃住肥料“三要素”的原理，害怕施肥越出“三要素”的框框，就会使稻子倒伏，拖延时间，拒不执行重施肥的措施。土壤系研究土化肥的尤德敏也同样如此。他看到试验田的施肥计划时，吓得直冒冷汗。一亩田要施二千斤绿肥，三百担塘泥，一百担堆肥，岂不是古今中外的奇闻！翻遍了农业科学的书也找不到这样的记录。这时，肥料已经大部分下田了，尤德敏就以土壤肥料专家的身份，提出了“放水洗田”的荒唐措施，要把肥料冲掉。
    因为整地整得不好，秧田里的淤泥陷到膝头，插秧的时候，田里站满了人，有插秧的，运秧的，检查质量的，拉绳子的，一亩地里有近百人来来去去，满田踩的都是脚印，许多熟练的插秧能手今年也掌握不住插秧的质量，插浅了秧苗站不稳，插稳了就陷下去；一般农业社最多只插二寸深，他们却要求插到三寸，最深的有五寸。这时大家都感到很困难，要求专家们想办法解决，可是那些专家尽站在田埂上指手划脚，还口口声声埋怨工人插秧技术不好。工人们伸出手指气愤地说：“手指头插下去顶多只有二寸深，请下来站站你就知道是什么原因了”。就是在最需要技术指导的时候，竟没有一个专家肯脱了鞋袜下到地里去，当然，他们也就提不出什么有效的措施来。
　　从实际出发，脱鞋下田  土专家叫枯稻起死回生
    秧栽下去以后，秧苗老是黄黄的，不肯发棵。这时迫切需要当机立断，从实际出发，改变栽培措施和田间加工方法。两位农业社来的生产能手薛增海和王进宝看看半死不活的秧苗，心里急得要命。按照他们的经验，秧栽下去半个月就一定要进行第一次田间加工，他们几次在田边向吴闓直提意见，要求他及早采取措施，但吴闓直老是笃笃念念，他说：“书上说得明明白白，不活棵是不能加工的。”但薛增海和王进宝二人的看法和他恰恰相反。他们说：“在秧苗迟迟不活棵的情况下，早加工可以促使秧苗生长。”可是他们这个很合乎科学原理的实践经验，并没有能打动吴闓直被书本迷了的心，加工时间一拖再拖，竟拖了三十一天之久。二位生产能手眼看着一片黄腊腊的病态的秧苗，心里像刀绞似地难受。
    因为加工太迟，秧苗开始分化，失去了烤田（即干田日照）的时机。当时吴闓直曾一再强调书本上的理论，认为分化后绝对不能烤田，不烤田可以争取分蘖。生产能手薛增海却坚决主张要烤田，他根据当时田间情况和自己生产的经验，三番五次地和洋专家争辩。他说：早稻分化期一般都有一星期时间，而且分化和分蘖始终是交叉进行的，如果机械地认为分化后不能烤田，那么在任何情况下都无法烤田，如果争取时机，在分化初期烤三天田，不但不影响分蘖，而且还可以促进分蘖。可是争辩的结果，洋专家用书本的权威压倒了薛增海的宝贵的实践经验，他的正确的完全符合实际情况的建议，却在“毫无科学根据”的罪名下，被一棍子打死了。
    在这股逆流下，薛增海和王进宝二人心里虽然非常痛苦，他们眼看着自己栽培的庄稼，白白地葬送了。但是，他们并不因此灰心泄气，仍然积极地提出建议，要求让他们进行一次“抓稻”，尽最后努力来挽救水稻。可是“抓稻”的技术，是他们家乡的传统，农业科学研究所没有人会做，薛增海和王进宝两人就一手包下了十一亩田的“抓稻”任务。他们在酷热的阳光下，整天蹲在稻丛里，顾不得虫咬，顾不得蒸人的热气，一棵一穴地抓，一面拔杂草，一面捏泥块，十一亩地里的每一棵稻秆他们都亲自整理了一番。两人一连搞了五天，才从稻丛里爬出来，已经累得路也走不动了。经过他们细心的护理，稻子的气色很快就转青，发育也比较正常了。很多参加试验田操作的工人，都深为他们两人的精神所感动，连那些固执的洋专家也不得不承认这次“抓稻”的效果是他们所想不到的。
    究竟谁是内行，谁是外行？究竟谁是真正的专家，谁是空头的专家？严酷的现实已经做出了明确的结论。最近，在总结早稻生产的会议上，曾有人尖锐地质问那些洋专家们：“在早稻试验过程中，你们亲自动手育过一棵秧没有？你们收过一棵稻没有？你们为丰产试验田解决了多少实际问题？”专家们，你们该怎样来回答这些问题呢？（附图片）
