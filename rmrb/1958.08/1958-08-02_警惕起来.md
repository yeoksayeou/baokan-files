Be Vigilant

Not long ago, the masses, militiamen, public security personnel, and garrison troops of Qinbei County in Guangdong and Shangsi County in Guangxi formed a tight encirclement. After more than a day of intense searching and fighting, they captured all three Kuomintang secret agents who had been airdropped. Reading this news is exciting, because it confirms once again that in the face of organized and conscious people, any sabotage activities by the enemy will not succeed. But on the other hand, this news also reminds us that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan has not given up, and is constantly trying to undermine our construction, and even妄想 (wang xiang - foolishly dream) to put our people back under its criminal rule.

Airdropping secret agents is one of the important means used by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out sabotage activities against us. Since the liberation of the whole country, the Kuomintang's secret service has been doing this kind of criminal activity, dropping batches of secret agents to the mainland. Although every time the airdropped agents are either captured alive or fall to their deaths, none can escape the net cast by the people, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group still refuses to give up. Especially since the situation in the Middle East and the world has become tense recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique believes that the time has come, and is clamoring to "counterattack the mainland." It is entirely certain that the Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the instigation of its master—American imperialism—will strengthen its espionage activities while intensifying its military harassment of the mainland, and send more secret agents from the air, sea, and land. In fact, with the help of the American secret service, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has trained and is continuing to train a large number of secret agents, ready to be airdropped to the mainland at any time. The Chiang Kai-shek clique wants these secret agents to come to the mainland to spy on military, economic, and political intelligence, and establish counter-revolutionary armed bases, so as to cooperate with its "counterattack on the mainland." Although these plans of the Chiang Kai-shek clique will burst like soap bubbles, we must be prepared at all times to give a heavy blow to the open and hidden enemies, and not let a single one of them run back.

There is no doubt that this so-called counterattack on the mainland by the Chiang Kai-shek clique will be crushed by us. However, crushing this clumsy move does not mean that the struggle in this area is over. As long as the American aggressors still occupy our territory of Taiwan, and as long as there is imperialism in the world, they will certainly make trouble with us. One of the ways to make trouble is to send secret agents to infiltrate our interior and carry out assassinations and sabotage activities when we are unprepared. This is one aspect. On the other hand, in our country, after the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, although the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been further severely打击 (da ji - hit hard, crack down on) and social order has been greatly consolidated, counter-revolutionary elements have not been completely eliminated, and the struggle between the enemy and ourselves still exists. Moreover, according to past experience, whenever there is any disturbance in the international situation, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements in the country often stir up trouble and step up their sabotage activities. Some people even妄想 (wang xiang - foolishly dream) to cooperate from within and without to support the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called "counterattack on the mainland." These aspects of the situation all show that in the long period to come, while concentrating our main efforts on economic and cultural construction, we must also strengthen our proletarian dictatorship and wage a tenacious struggle against enemies at home and abroad. There should be absolutely no麻痹大意 (ma bi da yi - carelessness/slackening vigilance) in this regard.

The people of our country, who have undergone long revolutionary struggles, have rich experience and a high degree of vigilance in fighting against enemies at home and abroad. The people of Qinbei County in Guangdong and Shangsi County in Guangxi are like this. As soon as enemy planes appeared in the sky, they immediately became vigilant and quickly joined the battle, making it impossible for the airdropped secret agents to hide. But it should not be denied that since our country has seen a high tide of great leaps in production and construction, some people have developed new ideas of peaceful麻痹 (ma bi - numbness, apathy). Some people think that the world is completely peaceful and that there will be no more sabotage by class enemies. Although some people think that there are still counter-revolutionary elements, they feel that their number is too small to cause any trouble, and they have relaxed their vigilance against them. These views are of course extremely wrong and very harmful. From the perspective of our country, there are indeed not many counter-revolutionary elements; but after several suppression of counter-revolutionaries and elimination of counter-revolutionaries movements, these people are still able to hide and refuse to bow their heads and admit their guilt to the people, which shows that they are the most reactionary and stubborn counter-revolutionary elements, and they are also very cunning guys. Under the unprecedentedly strong conditions of our people's regime, these few counter-revolutionary elements certainly cannot cause any major climate, but it is entirely possible for them to engage in some sabotage in places and departments that we do not pay attention to, causing undue losses to our cause. What should be seen in particular is that these few counter-revolutionary elements are not completely isolated. The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan supports them, American imperialism also supports them, and they are even directly dispatched by the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and implement resolute and merciless suppression against these die-hard counter-revolutionary elements in order to enhance our strength in fighting against the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and American imperialism, and ensure that our socialist construction cause proceeds.

The rapid capture of these three airdropped secret agents, in addition to the swift actions of the public security personnel and garrison troops, was largely due to the local people's constant high degree of vigilance and active assistance to the troops and public security personnel in the search and arrest. Therefore, the airdropped secret agents attracted the attention of the local people before they even landed. As soon as they landed, the shouts of searching for bandits and secret agents echoed throughout the mountains and fields, and more than 10,000 people participated in the search. The people of the whole country should, like them, constantly improve their revolutionary vigilance and actively cooperate with the public security departments to fight against hidden enemies, so that the enemy has no opportunity to take advantage of, and the enemy's counter-revolutionary elements who dare to carry out sabotage will be quickly caught. Doing so is a contribution to the country and the people, and at the same time, it is defending one's own happy life.

### 警惕起来

    警惕起来
    前不久，广东钦北和广西上思两县的群众、民兵、公安人员和驻军组成严密的包围圈，经过一天多紧张的搜索和战斗，把三名蒋帮空投特务统统活捉了。读到这个消息，一方面使人感到兴奋，因为它再次证实了，在组织起来和觉悟了的人民面前，敌人的任何破坏活动都不可能得逞。但是另一方面，这个消息也提醒我们，盘据在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团并没有死心，时时刻刻都在想破坏我们的建设，甚至妄想把我们的人民重新置于它的罪恶统治之下。
    空投特务，是蒋介石集团用来对我们进行破坏活动的重要手段之一。全国解放几年来，蒋帮的特务机关一直在干着这种罪恶的勾当，向大陆投下了一批又一批的特务。虽然每次空投下来的特务，不是被活捉就是被摔死，没有一个能够逃脱人民布下的天罗地网，但是反动成性的蒋介石集团仍然不肯罢手。特别是最近中东和世界的局势紧张起来以后，蒋介石集团更认为时机已到，大肆叫嚷着要“反攻大陆”。完全可以肯定，蒋介石集团在它的主子——美帝国主义的策动之下，在加强对大陆的军事骚扰的同时，必然加强特务活动，把更多的特务从空中、海上和地上派遣进来。而且事实上，蒋介石集团在美国特务机关的帮助之下，也已经训练好和正在继续训练大批的特务分子，准备随时空投到大陆上来。蒋介石集团要这些特务到大陆上来刺探军事、经济和政治情报，建立反革命的武装基地，好配合它“反攻大陆”。蒋介石集团的这些打算，虽然都会像肥皂泡一样破灭，但是我们却不能不时时刻刻作好准备，给予公开的和暗藏的敌人以沉重的打击，一个也不让他们跑回去。
    蒋介石集团的这次所谓反攻大陆的蠢动一定会被我们粉碎，这是肯定无疑的。但是，粉碎了这次蠢动，并不等于这方面的斗争就结束了。只要美国侵略者还霸占着我国领土台湾，只要世界上还有帝国主义，他们就一定要同我们捣乱。捣乱的方法之一，就是派遣特务打到我们的内部，乘我们不防备的时候进行暗害和破坏活动。这是一方面。另一方面，在我国国内，经过全民整风和反右派斗争，虽然进一步给了残余的反革命势力以沉重的打击，社会秩序是大大地巩固了，但是反革命分子并没有全部肃清，敌我之间的斗争仍然存在着。而且根据过去的经验，一遇到国际上有任何风吹草动，国内残余的反革命分子，也常常会兴风作浪，加紧进行破坏活动，有的人甚至妄想里应外合，以策应蒋介石集团的所谓“反攻大陆”。这些方面的情况都说明，在今后很长的时期内，我们在集中主要力量进行经济和文化建设的同时，还必须加强我们的无产阶级专政，同国内外的敌人作顽强的斗争。在这方面绝不应有任何的麻痹大意。
    经过长期革命斗争的我国人民，在同国内外的敌人作斗争上，是有着丰富的经验和高度的警惕性的。广东钦北和广西上思两县的人民就是这样，当敌机刚一出现在上空，他们就立即警惕起来，并且迅速投入了战斗，使空投特务无处藏身。但是也不应否认，自从我们的国家出现了生产建设大跃进的高潮以来，已经有一些人产生了新的和平麻痹思想。有的人认为，天下已经完全太平了，不会再有阶级敌人的破坏了。有的人虽然认为还有反革命分子，但又觉得他们的人数太少，成不了什么气候，也放松了对他们的警惕。这些看法当然是极其错误的，而且是非常有害的。从我国国内来说，反革命分子的确是不多了；但是经过几次镇反和肃反运动，这些人仍然能够隐蔽起来，不肯向人民低头认罪，这就说明他们都是一些最反动最顽固的反革命分子，而且是非常狡猾的家伙。在我们的人民政权空前强大的情况下，这少数的反革命分子固然成不了什么大气候，但是在我们不注意的地方和部门搞一些破坏，使我们的事业受到不应有的损失，这是完全可能的。尤其应该看到的是，这少数反革命分子并不是完全孤立的，台湾蒋介石集团支持他们，美帝国主义也支持他们，甚至就是美蒋特务机关直接派遣他们来的。对于这些死心塌地的反革命分子，我们必须保持高度的革命警惕，实行坚决无情的镇压，才能增强我们同台湾蒋介石集团和美帝国主义作斗争的力量，使我们的社会主义建设事业有保障地进行。
    这三名空投特务的迅速被捕获，除了公安人员和驻军部队的行动敏捷外，当地人民群众经常保持着高度的警惕性和积极协助部队和公安人员搜捕是一个有力的因素。因此空投特务还没有着陆，就能引起了当地群众的注意，刚一着陆，满山遍野就响彻了搜捕匪特的呼喊声，而且参加搜捕的群众有一万多人。全国人民应该像他们一样地经常提高革命警惕，积极配合公安部门同暗藏的敌人作斗争，使敌人无隙可乘，使敢于进行破坏的敌特反革命分子迅速地被捉住。这样作，对国家和人民是一种贡献，同时也是在保卫自己的幸福生活。
