Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: According to an Associated Press reporter today from Beirut, a Lebanese pilot refused to pilot an American invading force's transport ship into Beirut harbor and ran away before the transport ship left Beirut harbor.

The news reveals that the American transport ship "Comet," which Lebanese pilots refused to pilot, was the very one that transported seventy-two medium tanks and three light tanks of the American invading army's 35th Tank Battalion to Beirut harbor yesterday.

The American invading navy captain of the "Comet" admitted in a conversation that the Lebanese pilot boarded the ship, said only a few words to him, and then stood far away, leaving him to sail the ship into the port alone. He said that when the transport ship left the port, the Lebanese pilot "never appeared again."

    黎巴嫩爱国领港员
    不给美国运输舰领航
    新华社4日讯  据美联社记者今天自贝鲁特报道，黎巴嫩的一个领港员拒绝把美国侵略军的运输舰领进贝鲁特港，并且在这艘运输舰开出贝鲁特港以前就跑掉了。
    消息透露，为黎巴嫩领港员拒绝领航的是美国运输舰“彗星号”，正是它在昨天把美国侵略军第三十五坦克营的七十二辆中坦克和三辆轻坦克运到贝鲁特港的。
    “彗星号”的美国侵略海军舰长在谈话中承认，这个黎巴嫩领港员一上船，只对他讲几句话，就站得远远地由他独自把船开进港口。他说，当运输舰离开港口时，这个黎巴嫩领港员“再也没有出现”。
