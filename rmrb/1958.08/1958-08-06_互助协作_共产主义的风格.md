    Mutual Assistance and Cooperation - A Communist Style
    This year is a year in which China's national economy, cultural and educational departments, and various regions are extensively carrying out cooperation. Everywhere people can hear slogans such as "Supporting others is glorious, departmentalism is shameful," "If one factory has difficulties, everyone helps," "If something happens in one place, all sides support." A brand-new communist style is taking shape among the broad masses of working people in our country.
    People can see that many advanced units and individuals are now enthusiastically and unreservedly passing on their inventions, creations, and technical experience to others, helping other units and individuals to catch up with their own level. Many enterprises undertake all the work of new factory design, equipment installation, and worker training at no cost. Many enterprises and regions mutually adjust equipment, materials, and labor. Industrial and commercial departments are twisted into one rope to increase product output, improve product quality, and increase new varieties. Many cities take the initiative to transfer technical personnel and materials to the countryside to help rural areas build water conservancy projects; rural areas also take the initiative to help cities solve difficulties such as labor shortages, insufficient non-staple foods, and insufficient raw materials. What is particularly exciting is that in work such as water conservancy construction, afforestation, drought resistance, flood prevention, and harvesting, farmers have broken through the narrow-minded concept of only caring about their own locality that has existed for thousands of years, bringing their own food and tools, beating gongs, drumming, carrying red flags, and happily going to support other places. These facts show that the communist idea of "One for all, all for one" is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. This is one of the most important ideological conditions for building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    Our country has entered a new historical period of socialist construction centered on the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. The central task of our people is, under the guidance of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously running large, medium, and small enterprises, and simultaneously using both indigenous and foreign methods, to strive to transfer the national economy to the technical basis of modern large-scale production in a relatively short period of time in a planned and step-by-step manner, to maximize labor mechanization, to realize the electrification of urban and rural areas throughout the country; to industrialize the cities, provinces, and autonomous regions of the country, and even most of the special districts and counties; to enable the county towns and many townships across the country to have their own industries; to establish a modern transportation and postal and telecommunications network extending in all directions; and to develop cultural and educational undertakings serving economic construction. The technological revolution and the cultural revolution will not only enable our country to catch up with the world's most advanced levels in industry, agriculture, science, and culture, but will also lay a solid material foundation for building socialism and realizing a communist society in our country.
    A magnificent blueprint for construction is inspiring the 600 million people of our country. In order to realize the ideals of the whole people, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in our country are, in accordance with local resource conditions and actual needs, under the premise of centralized leadership, overall planning, and division of labor and cooperation, going all out, relying on their own efforts to develop local industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings, and in terms of industry, have already built tens of thousands of small factories and a number of medium-sized factories. However, because our country's economy and culture are still backward and development is extremely uneven, only a very small number of large cities and some regions have initially established the foundation of modern industry and the foundation of modern science and culture, while the industrial and scientific and cultural undertakings of the vast majority of provinces and autonomous regions are still in the initial stage of construction. Due to the lack of necessary industrial foundations and construction backbones, the scale of industrial construction in many provinces and autonomous regions is subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, in order to complete the historical task of technological revolution and cultural revolution, in addition to each locality carrying out construction independently and making every effort to solve all problems that can be solved by itself, it is also necessary to promote the communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, break down county and provincial boundaries, and establish cooperative relationships of mutual support and mutual exchange of what one has for what one needs. Regions with a relatively strong industrial base should take the initiative to support regions with a relatively weak industrial base. In areas where cooperation is implemented, provinces and cities with a relatively strong industrial base should take the initiative to support provinces, cities, and autonomous regions with a relatively weak industrial base. Within the scope of a province or city, cities with a relatively strong industrial base should take the initiative to support special districts and counties with a relatively weak industrial base, so that those provinces, cities, autonomous regions, special districts, and counties that originally had a relatively weak industrial base can build up their industries, especially backbone industries, as soon as possible. This principle of combining self-reliance and mutual support is applicable not only to industrial construction but also to agricultural construction and cultural construction.
    Organization brings great strength, and cooperation can generate new productive forces. Things that a unit, a department, or a region cannot do alone can be done by several units, several departments, or several regions organizing together and cooperating with each other. Things that a unit, a department, or a region can do can be done faster and better by several units, several departments, or several regions organizing together and cooperating with each other. For example, Taiyuan City used the method of organizing large-scale cooperation among existing enterprises to build seven medium-sized factories and one workshop with modern technical levels in just twenty days. Some of these factories took only tens of hours or more than one hundred hours from groundbreaking to commissioning. Under the full cooperation of more than two hundred units in the city, the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant also built a large converter workshop with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel in just forty-seven days. From this, it can be seen that organizing socialist large-scale cooperation is indeed the best way to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Grasping this method, coupled with the method of self-reliance of each unit, each department, and each region, the socialist construction cause will advance by leaps and bounds like a rocket.
    Cooperation is required by the socialist system itself. Division of labor and cooperation are two aspects of one thing. The more detailed the social division of labor, the more cooperation is needed. Since the first social division of labor appeared in human society, cooperation between people has become a necessary condition of life. However, since society has been divided into classes, not only have there been sharp conflicts between the exploiting class and the exploited class, but also serious conflicts of interest within the exploiting class. In such a society, although there are certain connections between various groups, between production departments, between regions, and between urban and rural areas, there is no real mutual assistance and cooperation. There is only the exploitation of economically backward areas by economically developed areas, the exploitation of rural areas by cities, the strong bullying the weak, the big swallowing the small, and the mutual squeeze of those with equal strength, and mutual deception. In such a society, the productive forces are subject to layers of constraints. Only socialist society has fundamentally changed this situation of past class antagonism. In socialist society, the means of production are owned by the whole people or collectively owned. Although each region, each department, each factory, and each cooperative has different divisions of labor and different work positions, their fundamental interests are the same. In socialist society, the development of economy and culture is not an anarchic state, not free competition, but develops in a planned and proportional manner according to the needs of people's lives and production development. In socialist society, there is no mutual exclusion and mutual annexation between departments and regions, but mutual support, mutual promotion, and common improvement. Cities no longer exploit rural areas, and the relationship between cities and rural areas is now one of urban-rural mutual assistance and worker-peasant alliance; moreover, everywhere there is the advanced helping the backward, and everyone advancing together. That is to say, in socialist society, mutual assistance and cooperation are the norms of interrelationships between people, between departments, and between regions, and are one of the basic characteristics of socialist relations of production.
    How one treats cooperation is a standard for measuring the degree of communist ideological consciousness of each unit and individual. Because the specific tasks undertaken by each region, each department, and each unit are different, some contradictions and uncoordinated phenomena are sometimes unavoidable. At this time, is one using a communist attitude or a capitalist attitude to view these phenomena? This is a key issue. The communist attitude is to regard the work of one's own region, department, and unit as part of the entire socialist construction cause, and to regard the difficulties of others as one's own difficulties, and the victory of others as one's own victory. In this way, when we deal with anything, we should not only think about ourselves, but also think about others. Once we understand this, any contradiction will be quickly resolved, and any uncoordinated phenomena will quickly turn into harmony. Conversely, some departmentalists who lack a communist style only care about themselves, not about others, only about the part, not about the whole. This not only fails to overcome contradictions but also complicates them, making mutual relations very tense and seriously damaging the overall interests of socialism.
    The nationwide rectification movement over the past year or so has deeply rooted the ideas of collectivism and communism in the hearts of the people. The broad masses of working people and cadres have shown an unprecedented upsurge of self-sacrifice in labor and in dealing with various problems. The communist style of cooperation has greatly overwhelmed the style of departmentalism. Under this situation, there are few or no people who openly oppose cooperation, but in actual work, there are still people who emphasize the importance of their own work, only ask for help from others, but do not help others, or who are not conscious, proactive, or enthusiastic enough in cooperation issues, pushing away what they can push

### 互助协作——共产主义的风格

    互助协作——共产主义的风格
    今年是我国国民经济和文教各部门及各地区广泛开展协作的一年。人们到处可以听到“支援别人光荣，本位主义可耻”、“一厂有困难，大家帮助”、“一地有事，四方支援”的口号。崭新的共产主义的风格正在我国广大劳动人民群众中形成起来。
    人们可以看到，现在有许多先进单位和个人，热心地毫无保留地向别人传授自己的发明创造和技术经验，帮助别的单位和个人赶上自己的水平。许多企业毫无代价地把新厂的设计、设备安装和工人培训等工作，全部包下来。许多企业之间、地区之间互相调剂设备、物资和劳动力，工业、商业部门扭成一条绳，增加产品产量，提高产品质量，增加新品种。许多城市主动地抽调技术人才和物资下乡，帮助农村兴修水利；各地农村也主动地帮助城市解决劳动力不足、副食品不足和原材料不足等困难。尤其令人兴奋的是在兴修水利、造林、抗旱、防涝和收割等工作中，农民们打破了几千年来只顾本乡本土的狭隘观念，自带粮食，自备工具，敲着锣，打着鼓，扛着红旗，高高兴兴地去支援别的地方。这些事实说明，“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想，正日益深入人心。这是多快好省地建设社会主义的最重要的思想条件之一。
    我国已经进入以技术革命和文化革命为中心的社会主义建设的历史新时期。我国人民的中心任务，就是在工农业并举、中央工业与地方工业并举、大中小型企业并举和土洋并举的方针下，争取在比较短的时间内，使国民经济有计划有步骤地转到现代化大生产的技术基础上来，最大限度地实现劳动机械化，实现全国城乡的电气化；使全国的城市、省、自治区，以至大部分的专区和县都实现工业化；使全国的县城和很多乡镇都有自己的工业；建立四通八达的现代交通运输网和邮电网；并且发展为经济建设服务的文化教育事业。技术革命和文化革命，不仅将使我们的国家在工业、农业和科学文化方面，都赶上世界上最先进的水平，而且将为在我国建成社会主义和实现共产主义社会奠定雄厚的物质基础。
    一幅雄伟的建设蓝图正在鼓舞着我国六亿人民。为了实现全民的理想，我国各省、市、自治区都正在根据当地的资源条件和实际需要，在集中领导、全面规划和分工协作的前提下，鼓足干劲，自力更生地发展着地方工业、农业和文化教育事业，并且在工业方面，已经建成了数以万计的小型工厂和一部分中型工厂。但是，由于我国现在的经济和文化仍然是落后的，而且发展极不平衡，全国只有极少数大城市和部分地区初步建立了现代化工业的基础和现代科学和文化基础，而绝大部分的省和自治区的工业和科学文化事业还处在开始建设的阶段。由于缺乏必要的工业基础和建设骨干，许多省、自治区的工业建设规模受到了一定的限制。因此，要想完成技术革命和文化革命的历史任务，除了各个地方自力更生地进行建设，把所有能够自己解决的问题都千方百计地加以解决以外，还必须发扬共产主义的互助合作精神，打破县界和省界，建立彼此支援、互通有无的协作关系。工业基础比较强的地区，应该主动地支援工业基础比较差的地区。在实行协作的地区内，工业基础比较强的省市，应该主动地支援工业基础比较差的省、市和自治区。在一个省市的范围内，工业基础比较强的城市，应该主动地支援工业基础比较差的专区和县，使那些原来工业基础比较差的省、市、自治区、专区和县，都能够尽快地把工业，特别是骨干工业建设起来。这种自力更生和互相支援相结合的原则，不仅适用于工业建设，也适用于农业建设和文化建设。
    组织起来力量大，协作能够产生新的生产力。一个单位、一个部门、一个地区单独办不到的事情，几个单位、几个部门、几个地区组织起来，互助协作，就可以办得到。一个单位、一个部门、一个地区能够办得了的事，几个单位、几个部门、几个地区组织起来，互相协作，就可以办得更快更好。例如太原市用组织现有企业大协作的办法，在短短的二十天内，就建成了七个具有现代技术水平的中型工厂和一个车间，其中有的工厂从破土兴建到投入生产，只用几十小时或一百多小时。上海第一钢铁厂在全市二百多个单位的全力协作下，也只用四十七天的时间就建成了一座年产六十万吨钢的大型转炉车间。由此可见，组织社会主义大协作，的确是多快好省地建设社会主义的一个最好方法。抓住了这个方法，加上各单位、各部门、各地区的自力更生的办法，社会主义建设事业就会像火箭一样，高速度地飞跃前进。
    协作是社会主义制度本身所需要的。分工和协作，是一件事情的两个方面。社会分工越细，越需要协作。从人类社会出现了第一次社会分工以来，人与人之间的协作就成为生活的必要的条件。但是，自从社会分化为阶级以后，不仅剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间存在着尖锐的冲突，而且在剥削阶级内部也存在着严重的利害冲突。在那样的社会里，各个集团之间、生产部门之间、地区之间以及城乡之间，虽然也有一定的连系，但是却没有真正的互助和协作。有的只是经济发达的地区剥削经济落后的地区，城市剥削农村，强凌弱，大吞小，势均力敌的互相倾轧，尔虞我诈。在那样的社会里，生产力受了层层的束缚。只有社会主义社会才把过去阶级对立的这种情况根本改变了。在社会主义社会里，生产资料是属于全民所有或集体所有的。每个地区、每个部门、每个工厂和合作社，虽然分工不同，工作岗位不同，根本利益却是一致的。在社会主义社会里，经济和文化的发展，不是无政府状态，不是自由竞争，而是根据人民的生活和生产发展的需要，有计划按比例地发展着。在社会主义社会里，各个部门之间、地区之间，不是两相排挤，互相并吞，而是互相支援，互相促进，共同提高。城市不再剥削农村，城市和农村的关系，现在是城乡互助、工农联盟的关系了；而且到处是先进的帮助落后的，大家共同前进。这就是说，在社会主义社会里，互助协作是人与人之间、部门与部门之间、地区与地区之间相互关系的准则，是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一。
    对待协作的态度如何，这是衡量每一个单位和个人的共产主义思想觉悟程度的标准。各地区、各部门、各单位因为所负担的具体任务不同，有时难免发生一些矛盾和不协调的现象，这个时候，是用共产主义的态度还是用资本主义的态度去看待这些现象呢？这是一个关键问题。共产主义的态度是把本地区、本部门、本单位的工作和别的地区、部门、单位的工作同样看做整个社会主义建设事业的一部分；把别人的困难看做自己的困难，把别人的胜利看做自己的胜利。这样，我们在处理任何事情的时候，不只要为自己想一想，同时也要为别人想一想。想通了，任何矛盾都会很快地解决，任何不协调现象都会很快地变为和谐。与此相反，有一些缺乏共产主义风格的本位主义者，处处只顾自己，不顾别人，只顾局部，不顾整体。这不仅克服不了矛盾，而且还会使矛盾复杂化，把相互的关系弄得很紧张，严重地损害社会主义的整体利益。
    一年多以来的全民整风运动，使集体主义、共产主义的思想深入人心。广大劳动人民和干部在劳动中，在处理各种问题的时候，表现了空前高涨的自我牺牲精神。共产主义协作之风大大压倒了本位主义之风。在这个形势下，公开提出反对协作的人是没有或者很少的了，但是在实际工作中强调自己工作的重要性，只要求别人帮助，而自己不帮助别人的，或者在协作问题上不够自觉、不够主动、不够热情、能推就推、能拖就拖的人仍然存在。对于他们，树立共产主义风格还是一个严重的任务。
    一切违反协作的精神都是与共产主义思想和作风不相容的，必须坚决地彻底地加以克服。东风不压倒西风，西风便压倒东风。任何阵地，共产主义思想不去占领，本位主义和资本主义思想便会乘虚而入，并且会刮起歪风，阻碍社会主义建设事业的前进。因此，为了让共产主义的协作更加广泛、更加深入地开展起来，我们必须继续拔掉本位主义和资本主义的白旗，高高地举起社会主义和共产主义的红旗。只有这样，我们才能够顺利地克服前进道路上的一切困难，才能多快好省地完成技术革命和文化革命的历史任务，更快地使我们伟大的祖国成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
