　　Communist Style
　　Selfless Support
    Our machine repair, sand casting and other factories in Masan Township have been rapidly established. An important reason why these factories were established so quickly is the great support given to us by the Party Committee and all the workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant.
    When we started to build the factories, we not only lacked experience, but also lacked the necessary manpower and materials, so we had to ask for support from outside factories. When we approached the Party Committee of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, Secretary Wei and Director Ren immediately agreed to our request and said that they would do their best to help. They gave us five rooms in Masan Township as factory buildings for our machine repair factory, and also sent two lathes, one planer, one mortising machine, and one press, as well as many parts. This enabled us to quickly establish our machine repair factory. The complete set of equipment for the sand casting factory was also supported by them. After the factory buildings were built, they helped solve the power supply and wiring problems.
    Now, when the people of our township mention the support of the smelting plant, they feel unspeakable gratitude in their hearts.

　　共产主义风格
　　无私的支援
    我们马三家乡的机修、翻砂等工厂已经迅速建立起来了。这几个厂所以办得这样快，沈阳冶炼厂党委和全体职工给予我们很大的支援是个重要原因。
    我们开始办工厂的时候，不但缺乏经验，就连必要的人力和物资也没有，只好请求外厂支援。当我们找到沈阳冶炼厂党委会的时候，魏书记和任主任马上答应了我们的要求，表示一定尽最大力量帮助。他们把在马三家乡的五间房子送给我们机修厂做厂房，同时还送来车床两台，刨床、凿眼机、压力机各一台，另外还有很多零件。这就使我们机修厂很快建立了起来。翻砂厂的全套设备也是由他们支援的。厂房建成后，电源、电线都是他们帮助解决的。
    现在，我们全乡人一提起冶炼厂支援我们的事情，心里就说不出地感激。中共沈阳县马三家乡委会　祁凤翔
