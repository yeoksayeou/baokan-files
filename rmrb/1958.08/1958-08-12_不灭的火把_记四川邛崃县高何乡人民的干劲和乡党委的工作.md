　　Westward from Qionglai County, along a road that is still under construction for ninety li, one can see slogans like "Great Battle of Gaohe Township" and "Fiercely Pursue Gaohe Township" everywhere, whether on rocks, memorial archways, or on the gates and walls of the People's Committees of various townships. In the office of the County Party Committee's mountain area work group, I saw a statistical table that read: total number of agricultural cooperatives in Gaohe Township: 35; number of advanced cooperatives: 35; total number of production teams: 145; number of advanced teams: 123. That is to say, all agricultural cooperatives in Gaohe Township are advanced, and the vast majority of production teams are also advanced.

　  Soaring Drive, Brilliant Achievements
    Since the beginning of this spring, the people of this township have been full of soaring drive. They go to work very early every day and work until late at night. At night, torches light up the four mountains. Every night, the whole township burns 10,000 to 20,000 jin of dried bamboo. The number of people in the township who should be working is 4,398, but the actual number of people working is 4,624. Many elderly people between the ages of fifty and eighty and children under the age of twelve also voluntarily go to work. Even disabled people without legs go to work to light torches for others. In the past four months, this township with a population of over 10,000 and more than 16,000 mu of cultivated land has accumulated 6 billion jin of fertilizer, an average of 367,000 jin per mu and 2.8 million jin per household. It has improved 12,600 mu of soil and deeply plowed and excavated 14,100 mu of fields and land. It has repaired 161 water conservancy projects and built 11 new weirs. They are striving to double their grain production this year compared to last year, guaranteeing an increase of 5 million jin.

    How is their drive boosted and maintained? How does the township's grassroots Party committee carry out its work? Comrade Zhang Guisheng, Deputy Minister of the County Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department stationed in this township, and Comrade Zhang Zuocai, Secretary of the Township Party Committee, answered this question and introduced the situation in this regard.

    Thorough Victory of the Rectification Movement
　  Laying the Ideological Foundation for the Great Leap Forward
    The rectification movement laid the foundation for all work in the township and created extremely favorable conditions for the subsequent Great Leap Forward. The airing of views in this township was very thorough. The number of households that expressed their views accounted for 96.6% of the total number of households in the township (almost 100% except for the deaf, the dumb, and the elderly five-guarantee households). A total of 19,646 opinions were put forward, of which 70% to 80% were correct or basically correct. At the beginning, anti-socialist elements were rampant, and they attacked socialism wantonly. At that time, some people wavered, some echoed, and some were indignant. The masses urgently needed to clarify some fundamental issues. Therefore, the township Party committee led everyone to launch a debate: Is the Communist Party good or the Kuomintang good? Is it better after liberation or before liberation? Everyone recalled the past, collected materials, exhibited objects, and spoke actively. The result of the debate was that it was not good before liberation: opium was planted everywhere in the township, and there were bandits everywhere. When walking, even carrying a jin of salt, two dou of rice, or even wearing a new pair of straw sandals would be robbed. The local "king" Xie Songgao rode on the heads of the people and plundered them. Farmers only ate 120 jin of grain per year and lived by eating tree leaves, banana heads, and bamboo chicken roots. It is good after liberation: the people have turned over and become masters of their own affairs, social order is stable, and production has increased after cooperation, and they eat five or six hundred jin of grain every year. The Kuomintang was not good: exorbitant taxes and levies, grain requisition and conscription, and they did not do a single good thing for the people. The Communist Party is good: from suppressing bandits and combating local despots, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, unified purchase and sale, all the way to mutual aid and cooperation, everything is done for the people. The masses recalled what rumors appeared in society during each movement in the past, their own thoughts at the time, the distance between the facts after the movement and their own thoughts, and what thoughts they still had, etc., and talked about them one by one. Some people remembered that they always had wrong ideas at the beginning of every movement of the Party in the past and felt ashamed. Some people who had said wrong things remembered that they could not even afford a wife before liberation, but now they have many children and regretted it very much. Gao Youhong, the captain of the first team of the second cooperative of the fifth village, burst into tears when he recalled the painful life in the past, causing more than a thousand people present to shed tears. Through fierce debate, the masses came to the conclusion: It is not wrong to listen to the Communist Party! Always follow the Communist Party. While carrying out thorough rectification work, the township Party committee also conducted socialist future education for the masses in a timely manner, combined with the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, and put forward the township's long-term plan, which greatly encouraged the masses. Therefore, when the bugle call of the Great Leap Forward sounded, the drive of the masses was like a bamboo shoot breaking through the ground, unstoppable.

    The thorough victory of the rectification movement, the great improvement of the masses' awareness, coupled with the strong political and ideological leadership of the township Party committee, have kept and consolidated the revolutionary drive of the masses.

    Continuous Revolution, Continuous Leap Forward
    First of all, the township Party committee adopted the method of continuous revolution, so that the broad masses and the work of the whole township were constantly in a small movement following a small movement. On the one hand, they promptly put forward the goals for a period of time according to the production season and mobilized the masses to complete them. They changed the past practice of making arrangements every ten days and a half months and adopted the practice of arranging plans for a period of time every few days. For example, working hard for seven days and nights to complete the rice transplanting work, working hard for three days and nights to complete the field management work of cultivating and weeding, etc. In this way, the center is prominent, the task is clear, the cadres have a clear idea, and the achievements or shortcomings are significant, which is easy to compare. At the same time, they also specifically helped the cooperative and team cadres arrange the central production tasks. On the other hand, they seized all favorable opportunities to launch political mass movements to constantly boost the drive of the masses. For example, during the spring plowing production, a 10,000-person oath-taking rally was held, proposing the slogan of making contributions to socialism and creating benefits for future generations. After listening to the two farmers from Xiaogan County who came to the township to convey their situation of the Great Leap Forward, they immediately held a meeting to swear an oath to the Party and pledge to the Party, determined to learn the revolutionary drive of the farmers of Xiaogan and proposed to increase grain production by 5 million jin. When the county party committee awarded this township a "Leap Forward Banner," it immediately launched a movement to greet the red flag with greater achievements in production. After the red flag arrived in the township, the township Party committee promptly put forward the slogan of opposing pride and opposing relaxation, and letting the red flag take root in Gaohe Township, and immediately launched a red flag protection movement to boost the drive and do a good job in production. Before the county party committee inspection team came, everyone was called upon to work hard for five days and nights to welcome the county party committee inspection team. Before the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee inspection team came, the masses were repeatedly told that the Prefectural Committee was very busy and wanted to come to this remote mountain area, which was an infinite concern for the township, and the masses were mobilized to work hard for seven days and nights to welcome the Prefectural Committee inspection team. Other things such as the delegation from Dayi County and the delegations from various townships in this county coming to visit, Sichuan University asking this township to send people to report, etc., all became topics for them to encourage the masses. In this way, the revolutionary drive of the masses was like the front wave was not flat, and the back wave rose again, leaping forward section by section and rising month by month.

　　Conducting Political and Ideological Work Through Debate
    Secondly, the vast majority of the masses in this township listened to the Party's words 100%, and the Party committee's call and instructions were implemented without discount. In this case, is there no need for in-depth and meticulous ideological work and mass work? The township Party committee's answer is: No. How to carry out ideological work and mass work? The answer is: through debate.

    Before the arrival of each political movement and after the assignment of production tasks, various ideological problems will always be encountered among some of the masses, and the solution is to let the masses debate. For example, at the beginning of the fertilizer accumulation movement, the idea of only being willing to accumulate a small amount of good fertilizer and not being willing to accumulate a large amount of grass turf fertilizer and rotten wood fertilizer was encountered. At this time, the masses were mobilized to debate: Is it possible to increase production without fertilizer? Is it enough to only accumulate a small amount of fertilizer? What is the reason why the rice seedlings at the foot of the field ridge grow better than the rice seedlings in the center of the field because the grass turf of the field ridge is shoveled into the field every year? When improving the soil, some people said, "The land is born, how can it be improved?" Then a debate was launched on what is the difference between growing crops in barren soil and fertile soil, and whether thin soil can be changed into thick soil, etc. Reforming the cultivation system, changing sparse planting to dense planting, encountered the traditional ideological problem of the local masses: "Sparse planting, three dan; dense planting, just enough to plant," that is, debating the benefits of changing to four six inches (four inches between nests, six inches between rows) and three seven inches for increasing production. When repairing water conservancy, the conservative idea that "the original water conservancy is almost good enough" and the slack idea of not being active in doing it when it rains were encountered. Advancing the planting season also encountered the old idea that mountainous areas are cold and always later than plain areas. These all have to be resolved one by one through debate. Through frequent debates, the masses educated themselves, and they also educated the cadres, and the cadres also educated the masses. The result is that all backward and conservative ideas were swept away, and advanced revolutionary ideas were greatly promoted, thereby boosting morale and promoting work.

    Helping the Backward Improve to the Advanced Level with Full Enthusiasm
    Third, the Party committee paid special attention to the enthusiastic encouragement and specific assistance to backward cooperatives and backward teams, and many cooperatives were thus raised to the level of advanced cooperatives. Their approach is: 1. More praise, less criticism, and try to encourage the masses to criticize themselves when criticizing. For example, at the beginning, the first cooperative of the third village accumulated the most fertilizer, and the members of other cooperatives criticized the cooperative cadres: Why can't we do what others have done? At the same time, listening to the report and dismissing the meeting at the same time, why are others advanced and we are backward? 2. Help the backward cooperatives with full enthusiasm, and continue to help them until they make achievements and change their appearance. The second cooperative of the fifth village was originally a backward cooperative. In the past, when the cooperative director held meetings, he rarely spoke loudly. The township Party committee sent cadres to provide specific assistance, and the production appearance gradually changed. On the eighth day of the first lunar month, this cooperative improved more than 30 mu of soil and accumulated more than 200,000 jin of fertilizer, jumping to the forefront of the township. 3. Be good at discovering individual advanced factors in backward units and praise them in a timely manner, even if these advanced factors are not very prominent. The first cooperative of the eighth village did not have much confidence in catching up with the advanced in the past. Some of the teams did a better job in improving the soil. When rice was just transplanted, there were two or three mu of fields that met the dense planting specifications. They were praised in a timely manner and organized to visit, which boosted the morale of the cooperative. Now this cooperative has become one of the five most advanced cooperatives in the township.

    Diverse Forms of Lively and Vivid Propaganda and Mobilization Work
    Fourth, the township's propaganda and mobilization work is done very well. "Politics takes command, propaganda is the vanguard" is always the decisive condition for them to break through one fortress after another. The township's propaganda forms are diverse, including Gaohe News (weekly, mimeographed), blackboard newspapers, stone newspapers, comparison platforms, honor lists, red and black lists, good news reports, honor lights, couplets, cheerleading teams, mountain songs, and earth broadcasts, etc. The township has a comparison platform for the township, and the cooperative has a comparison platform for the cooperative: the advanced cooperatives and teams "sit" on rockets, and the backward ones "sit" on chicken carts. All cooperative members must be rated after each production campaign to see who is a first-class member, who is a second-class member, and who is a third-class member. The township has red flags issued to advanced cooperatives, and the cooperatives have red flags issued to advanced teams. The ceremony for awarding the red flag each time is very grand. When the production team leader goes to work, he wears a loudspeaker on his waist and does propaganda and mobilization work in the field in a timely manner. The content of the propaganda is both vivid and rich. Mountain songs play a good role in propaganda and mobilization. When it rains, the masses sing: "Comrades, hurry up and refuel, the rain in the sky is out of nowhere, everyone works hard and refuels, and a happy life is behind." A quick-talking song that arranges work sings: "Corn is planted in mid-February, some are plowing the second field, the cooperative members go to repair the dam at night, and dig the pond deep and wide." When changing the mud field, everyone sings together: "Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty, difficulties cannot scare the heroes, resolutely complete the mud field." The result of doing so is that the vast majority of cooperative members are always in a happy mood and full of energy.

    Continuously Solving Specific Problems in the Leap Forward
    Fifth, constantly pay attention to solving specific problems in various works. Such as the problem of weighing the large amount of fertilizer carried by each member, the calculation of work points for cooperative employees, and the rest of members, etc. At the beginning, the members, due to their high degree of political enthusiasm, did not care how many kilograms of fertilizer they carried and how many work points they should get. But this is not a long-term solution. Each cooperative has adopted the method of weighing according to the backpack and paying more for more work to give a reasonable solution. The township stipulates that one night off is taken every five or seven days, without going to work or attending meetings, so that members can get adequate rest. They have also begun to pay attention to technical reforms to reduce labor intensity, and are planning to train cattle to carry goods and erect aerial transport lines, etc. Other things such as the control and supervision of landlords, rich peasants, reactionaries, and bad elements, so that they dare not talk nonsense; improving vigilance, so that they have no opportunity to take advantage of, also ensure the smooth progress of the Great Leap Forward.

　  Holding High the Revolutionary Torch and Advancing Triumphantly
    Gaohe, this remote mountain township located at the foot of the towering Qionglai Mountains and on the banks of the rushing Yuxi River, once established a Soviet regime here for more than two months in 1935 when Comrade Xu Xiangqian led the Red Army on the Long March. In Shaba Village, where the township people's committee is located, and along the way in the deep mountains, many stone tablets are engraved with slogans left by the Red Army: "Expand the National Revolutionary War!" "The poor will not be slaves to the country, only joining the Red Army is the way out!" These slogans, as well as the revolutionary deeds of the Red Army in those years, are torches held high, illuminating the hearts of the people in the mountainous areas. The soaring drive of the people in the mountainous areas, and the millions of torches lit all over the mountains and plains, are the continuation of the torches held high by the Red Army in those years. These torches will never go out! Even if it will be partially replaced by kerosene lamps and horse lamps in the near future; in the not-too-distant future, when the Yuxi River water is diverted through the seven-mile-long tunnel dug by the people in the mountainous areas and a power station is built, it will be replaced by countless electric lights; but the working people will still hold high the revolutionary torch! The torch lit by the Red Army in those years! It will always illuminate the hearts of the people in the mountainous areas, illuminate the road for the people in the mountainous areas to move forward, and guide the people in the mountainous areas to advance rapidly towards the happy paradise of communism.

　　不灭的火把
　　记四川邛崃县高何乡人民的干劲和乡党委的工作
　　本报记者　余章瑞
    从邛崃县城向西，沿着一条尚未完工的公路走去，沿途九十里，无论是在岩石上、牌坊上，还是在各乡人民委员会的大门上、墙壁上，都可以看到“大战高何乡”、“猛追高何乡”的标语。在县委山区工作组办公室里，我看见这样一张统计表，写着高何乡总农业社数三十五，先进社数三十五，总生产队数一百四十五，先进队数一百二十三。这就是说，高何乡所有的农业社都是先进的，绝大部分的生产队也都是先进的。
　  冲天的干劲　辉煌的战果
    从今年开春到现在，这个乡的人民，一直是干劲冲天。他们每天很早就出工，一直干到深夜。一到晚上，四山亮起火把。每晚全乡要烧一万斤到两万斤枯竹。全乡应出工的人数四千三百九十八人，但实出工四千六百二十四人。许多五十岁到八十岁的老人和十二岁以下的小孩也自动出工了。连没了双腿的残废人，也出工给人打火把。四个月来，这个一万多人口、一万六千多亩耕地的乡，积肥六十亿斤，平均每亩三十六万七千斤，每户积肥二百八十万斤。改良土壤一万二千六百亩，深耕深挖田和地一万四千一百亩。修复水利一百六十一处，新修堰十一条。他们争取今年粮食比去年翻一番，保证增产五百万斤。
    他们的干劲是怎样鼓足和保持的？乡基层党委是怎样进行工作的？驻在这个乡的县委财贸部副部长张贵生同志和乡党委书记张作才同志回答了这个问题，并介绍了这方面的情况。
    整风运动的彻底胜利
　  为大跃进奠定思想基础
    整风运动给全乡一切工作打下了基础，为以后的大跃进创造了极其有利的条件。这个乡的鸣放十分深透。鸣放过的户数占全乡总户数96.6％（除了聋子、哑叭、年迈的五保户，几乎是百分之百）。共提出了一万九千六百四十六条意见，其中70％到80％的意见是正确的或基本正确的。开始时，反社会主义分子嚣张一时，他们大肆攻击社会主义。当时，一些人动摇，一些人附和，一些人愤恨。群众迫切需要澄清一些根本问题。于是乡党委领导大家展开辩论：共产党好还是国民党好？解放后好还是解放前好？大家回忆往事，搜集材料，展览实物，积极发言。辩的结果是，解放前不好：全乡到处种鸦片烟，到处是盗匪。走路时，背一斤盐、两斗米，甚至穿一双新草鞋也要被抢走。土“国王”谢松高骑在人民头上，搜刮人民，农民每年只吃一百二十斤粮，靠吃树叶、芭蕉头、竹鸡根过活。解放后好：人民翻身当家作主，社会秩序安定，合作化后增了产，每年吃五、六百斤粮。国民党不好：苛捐杂税，征粮抓丁，没有给人民做过一件好事。共产党好：从清匪反霸、土改、镇反、统购统销，一直到互助合作，无一不是为人民办好事。群众回忆每一个运动来时，社会上出现什么谣言，当时自己的想法，以后的事实同自己的想法有什么距离，现在还有那些想法等等，都一件件谈出来。有人想起过去对党的每一个运动开始时总有错误想法，觉得心情愧怍，有的说错话的人想起解放前连老婆也讨不起，现在儿女成群，懊悔莫及。五村二社一队队长高有洪回忆到过去的痛苦生活时，放声大哭，引得到会的一千多人都落了泪。通过激烈的争辩，群众得出结论：听共产党的话没有错！永远跟着共产党走。乡党委一面进行彻底的整改工作，一面及时地向群众进行了社会主义前途教育，结合发展农业纲要四十条，提出了乡的远景规划，对群众的鼓舞极大。于是，当大跃进的号角吹响时，群众的干劲就势如破竹，锐不可当。
    整风运动的彻底胜利，群众觉悟的大大提高，加上乡党委有力的政治思想领导，就使群众的革命干劲保持和巩固起来了。
    不断革命不断跃进
    首先，乡党委采取了不断革命的方法，使广大群众和全乡的工作，不断地处在一个小运动接着一个小运动之中。一方面，他们根据生产季节，及时提出一个时期的奋斗目标，动员群众去完成。他们改变了过去十天半月一安排的办法，采取一个时期的计划几天就一安排的作法。如苦战七昼夜完成插秧工作，苦战三昼夜完成田间管理中耕除草工作等等。这样做中心突出，任务明确，干部心中有数，成绩或缺点显著，易于评比。同时又具体帮助了社、队干部安排了中心生产任务。另一方面，他们抓住了一切有利时机，掀起政治性的群众运动，不断鼓足群众干劲。如春耕生产时，召开万人誓师大会，提出为社会主义立功，为子孙万代造福的口号。在听了孝感县两位农民来乡传达他们大跃进的情况以后，即召开向党宣誓、向党保证大会，决心学习孝感农民的革命干劲，会上提出增产粮食五百万斤。在县委评给本乡一面“跃进帅旗”时，即发起用生产上的更大成绩迎接红旗的运动。红旗到乡以后，乡党委又及时提出反骄傲、反松劲，让红旗在高何乡生根的口号，立即在鼓足干劲搞好生产上，掀起一个保红旗运动。在县委检查团来以前，号召大家苦战五昼夜，迎接县委检查团。温江地委检查团来以前，即反复向群众说明，地委百忙中要来这偏僻山区，是对本乡的无限关怀，发动群众苦战七昼夜，迎接地委检查团。其它如大邑县代表和本县各乡代表来参观，四川大学请本乡派人去作报告等等，都成为他们鼓动群众的题目。就这样，使群众的革命干劲有如前浪未平，后浪又起，节节跃进，月月高涨。
　　通过辩论做政治思想工作
    其次，这个乡绝大部分群众百分之百地听党的话，党委一个号召一个指示，就不折不扣地执行。在这种情况下，是不是不需要深入细致的思想工作和群众工作呢？乡党委的回答是：不。怎样进行思想工作和群众工作？回答是：通过辩论。
    每一项政治运动到来之前和生产任务下达以后，在一部分群众中总会碰到各种各样思想问题，解决的办法就是让群众辩论。如在积肥运动开始时，就碰到只愿意积少量好肥，不愿意积大量草皮肥、烂木肥的思想。这时就发动群众辩论：要增产没有肥料行不行？光只积少量肥料够不够？田坎脚下的秧苗因每年铲田坎草皮倒到田里就比田中心的秧苗长得好是什么原因？改良土壤时，也有人说：“地是天生就的，咋个能改良？”便开展辩论瘦土肥土种出庄稼有什么区别，薄土是不是能改成厚土等问题。改革耕作制度，改稀植为密植，碰到当地群众传统的思想问题：“稀稀散，打三担；密密种，刚够种”，即辩论改为四六寸（窝距四寸，行距六寸）、三七寸对增产的好处。修水利，即碰到“原来水利就差不多了”的保守思想和一下雨就不积极搞的松劲思想。提前播种季节，也碰到山地天寒，从来都是比平坝地区要晚一些的旧思想。这些都要经过辩论，一一给以解决。经常进行辩论，群众自己教育了自己，也教育了干部，干部也教育了群众。结果是，一切落后保守思想望风披靡，先进革命思想大大发扬，从而鼓足了干劲，推动了工作。
    满腔热情帮助落后提高到先进水平
    第三，党委会特别注意对落后社和后进社的热情鼓励和具体帮助工作，不少社就是这样被提高到先进社的水平的。他们的做法是：一、多表扬，少批评，批评时也尽量启发群众自己起来批评。如开始时三村一社积肥积得最多，别的社社员就向社干部提出批评：人家做到为什么我们做不到？同时听的报告，同时散会回家，为什么人家先进我们落后？二、满腔热情地帮助落后社，一直要帮助到作出成绩，改变了面貌。五村二社原是落后社，过去开会时，社主任很少大声讲过话。乡党委就派干部去具体帮助，生产面貌逐步有了改变。正月初八那天，这个社就改良土壤三十多亩，积肥二十几万斤，一下跑到全乡最前面。三、要善于发现后进单位中个别先进的因素，及时加以表扬，即使这些先进的因素并不很突出。八村一社过去赶先进的信心不大，在改良土壤中个别的队工作作的较好一些，刚栽秧时有两三亩田合乎密植规格，就及时表扬，组织参观，使这个社的干劲鼓足起来。现在这个社成为全乡五个最先进的社之一。
    形式多样内容生动的宣传鼓动工作
    第四，这个乡的宣传鼓动工作做得很出色。“政治作统帅，宣传打先锋”，永远是他们攻破一个堡垒又一个堡垒的决定条件。这个乡的宣传形式多种多样，有高何报（周刊，油印）、黑板报、石头报、评比台、光荣榜、红黑榜、喜报、光荣灯、对联、拉拉队、山歌号子、土广播等等。乡有乡的评比台，社有社的评比台：先进的社和队“坐”火箭，落后的“坐”鸡公车。所有社员都要在每一项生产运动之后进行评类，看谁是一类社员，谁是二类、三类社员。乡有发给先进社的红旗，社有发给先进队的红旗。每一次颁发红旗的仪式都十分隆重。生产队长出工时，腰上挂着喇叭筒，在田间及时作宣传鼓动工作。宣传内容既生动又丰富。山歌号子在宣传鼓动中起着很好的作用。下雨时，群众就唱：“同志们快加油，天上下雨没来头，大家努力加油干，幸福生活在后头。”一支安排活路的快板唱道：“二月中旬把玉米点，有些在耕二道田，社员晚上去修堰，挖得水塘深又宽。”改烂泥田时，大家齐唱：“不怕苦，不怕难，困难吓不倒英雄汉，坚决改完烂泥田。”这样做的结果，使广大社员一直处在心情愉快、精神饱满的状态中。不断解决跃进中的具体问题
    第五，不断注意解决各项工作中的具体问题。如每个社员背来的大量肥料的过秤问题，社员工分的计算问题，社员的休息问题等等。开始时，社员由于高度的政治热情，一点也不计较自己背的肥是多少斤，该得多少工分。但这不是长久之计。各社都采取按背兜计重、多劳多得的办法给以合理解决。乡里规定每五天或七天休息一个晚上，不出工，不开会，让社员能够充分的休息。革新技术，减低劳动强度问题，他们也开始注意，正筹划训练耕牛驮运，架设高空运输线等等。其他如对于地富反坏分子的管制和监督，使他们不敢乱说乱动；提高警惕，使之无可乘之机，也保证了大跃进的顺利进行。
　  高举革命的火把乘胜前进
    高何，这个位于崇峻的邛崃山脉下面，急湍的玉玺河边的偏僻山乡，1935年徐向前同志率领红军长征时曾经在这里建立过两个多月的苏维埃政权。乡人委所在的沙坝村和深山沿途各处，许多石碑上刻有红军遗留下的标语：“扩大民族革命战争！”“穷人不当亡国奴，只有参加红军才是出路！”这些标语，以及当年红军的革命事迹，就是一个个高举的火把，照亮了山区人民的心。山区人民豪迈的冲天干劲，满山遍野燃起的千万个火把，就是当年红军高举的火把的继续。这些火把永远不会熄灭！即使它在最近将会部分地被汽灯和马灯所代替；不远的将来，当玉玺河水通过山区人民开凿的七里长的隧道引来，建成发电站时，将被无数盏电灯所代替；但劳动人民仍将高举起革命的火把！当年红军点燃的火把！它将永远照亮山区人民的心，照亮山区人民前进的道路，引导山区人民迅速地向共产主义的幸福乐园前进。
