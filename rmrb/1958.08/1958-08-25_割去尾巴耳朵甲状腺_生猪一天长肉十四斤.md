According to the New Hunan Daily: The Chinese Communist Party’s Huarong County Committee in Hunan Province has decided to implement “three cuts” for fattening pigs throughout the county from now until September.

The "three cuts" fattening method was successfully tested by Guo Yu, Yan Guozhang, Peng Genhan and other comrades from the Huarong County Animal Husbandry and Aquatic Products Management Department's pig warehouse.

In late July, they began to adopt the method of removing the thyroid glands, cutting (trimming) the ears, and cutting the tails of pigs. On average, each pig gained about four jin of meat per day, with the highest reaching eight jin in one day. Later, due to the improvement of cutting techniques and feeding management, the meat gain of pigs that underwent the cutting operation also continued to increase. On July 22, they selected a pig weighing 173 jin for the "three cuts" surgical experiment. By the 26th, it had gained 42.5 jin in five days, an average of 8.5 jin per day, with a peak of 11.5 jin in one day. By August 14, it had reached 248 jin, averaging slightly less than 4 pounds a day during these 19 days. Now the pig is growing normally with no signs of weight loss. On August 7, they conducted another experiment with a pig originally weighing 101 jin. On August 15, it was slaughtered and weighed 148 jin, gaining a total of 47 jin in 8 days, an average of about 6 jin per day, with the highest being 14.5 jin, setting a new record for pig meat gain and launching the first "satellite" in pig fattening. In order to test the quality of this pork, the warehouse slaughtered a pig that had not been fattened at all to compare whether there was any difference between the two types of pork, and the result was that there was no difference in taste.

Xinhua News Agency: Implementing tail docking of pigs can result in a gain of more than two jin of meat per day per pig. This was successfully tested recently by Zhu Peide, a veterinarian from the Taiyuan City Food Company.

Based on the rural saying that pigs gain weight faster after tail docking to treat diseases, and the principle that the tail tip is far from the heart and blood circulation is slow, Zhu Peide began to conduct tail docking experiments. The first time, one Chinese inch was cut off, and then every ten to twenty days it was cut again four or five times. Each time the length of the tail cut was only one to two centimeters, and the blood loss was only 400 cc. 7% iodine was used for disinfection to prevent rot. Through continuous experiments on 66 pigs, it was found that removing the pig's tail releases a small amount of stale blood containing waste and waste gas, which can cause the pig's blood to circulate smoothly, promote the hematopoietic function of the red bone marrow to produce a large amount of fresh blood, increase disease resistance, and increase absorption function, so that the nutrients in the feed are fully absorbed, which accelerates pig growth. Each pig gains 2.3 jin of meat per day, and the quality of the meat is also very high. (Attached picture)

　　割去尾巴耳朵甲状腺
    生猪一天长肉十四斤
    据新湖南报消息：中共湖南华容县委决定从现在起到9月份内在全县实现生猪“三割”催肥化。
    三割催肥法是华容县畜牧水产经理部生猪仓库郭玉、严国璋、彭根汉等同志试验成功的。
    7月下旬他们开始采取了割除生猪甲状腺、割（剪）耳、割尾的办法，两头生猪平均每日长肉四斤左右，其中最高的一天长八斤。后来由于割除技术的熟练和饲养管理等同时改进，被施行了割除手术的生猪长肉情况也随之不断上升。7月22日他们选择了一头重一百七十三斤的生猪，作“三割”手术试验，到26日，五天中增长四十二斤半，平均每天长八斤半，突出的一天长十一斤五两；到8月14日，已达二百四十八斤，在这十九天中平均每天长一斤十二两弱，现在该猪生长正常，无退肥现象。8月7日他们又以原重一百零一斤的生猪进行试验，8月15日宰杀重达一百四十八斤，8天之内共长四十七斤，平均每日长约六斤，其中最高的一天，增长十四斤半，创生猪长肉最高纪录，发射了生猪催肥的第一颗“卫星”。该仓库为了测验这种猪肉的质量，宰了一头完全没有经过催肥的生猪，对比两种猪肉是否有不同之处，结果味道毫无异处。
    据新华社讯　实行生猪切尾，每头猪每天可以长肉二斤多。这是太原市食品公司兽医朱培德最近试验成功的。
    朱培德根据农村流传的切尾治病后生猪长肉快，和尾尖距心脏远，血液循环慢的原理，开始作切尾试验。第一次切去一市寸，以后，每隔十天到二十天续切一次，共切四五次。每次切尾长度不过一到二公分，流血不过四百西西。并且用7％的碘酒消毒，防止腐烂。这样连续给六十六头猪试验，由于把猪尾切除后放出少量含有废料废气的陈血，能够引起猪的血液畅通，促进红骨髓造血机能制造大量新鲜血液，增加抗生能力，增加吸收机能，使饲料中的养分充分吸收，这样便加速生猪生长。每头猪每天长肉二斤三两，而且肉的质量也很高。（附图片）
