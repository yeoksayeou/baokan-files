　　·Hungary·
　　Agricultural Cooperatives Greatly Consolidated
    This year, Hungary's agricultural collectivization movement has obtained more favorable development conditions than ever before.
    Agricultural production cooperatives have been greatly consolidated.
    This year, the yield per "hold" (approximately 8.55 "shi mu") of land in agricultural production cooperatives is one to three quintals higher than that of individual farmers. The cooperatives' investment, cultivated land area, and livestock numbers have also increased.
    All of this has increased the attractiveness of cooperatives to individual farmers. Many individual households in villages began joining cooperatives before the harvest was even over.
    In the first half of this year, Hungary already had 2,657 agricultural production cooperatives, 819 production teams, and 2,393 mutual cultivation teams. These production organizations have a total of more than 240,000 people, with a cultivated area of 1.65 million holds.

　　·匈牙利·
　　农业合作社大大巩固
    今年匈牙利农业合作化运动已经获得了比以往任何一个时候都更为有利的发展条件。
    农业生产合作社已经大大地巩固了。
    今年农业生产合作社每一霍尔德（合八点五五市亩）土地的产量比个体农户多一到三公担。合作社的投资、耕地面积和牲畜头数也都增加了。
    这一切都提高了合作社对个体农民的吸引力。许多村庄的单干户不等收割结束就开始加入了合作社。
    今年上半年匈牙利已经有二千六百五十七个农业生产合作社，八百一十九个生产合作组，二千三百九十三个共耕组。这些生产组织共拥有二十四万多人，耕地面积达一百六十五万霍尔德。
