Xinhua News Agency, August 18th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. newspapers recently reported that the U.S. Department of Defense is studying the issue of the United States having to surrender in a future nuclear war. This event, reflecting the loss of confidence of the American military authorities, has caused a commotion within the American ruling class.

According to news published by the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," three scientific institutions commissioned by the U.S. Department of Defense are studying the questions of "whether the United States can survive" if a nuclear war breaks out and "under what conditions it would be more appropriate to surrender than to try to continue a war that has already failed." The newspaper said that the scientists engaged in this research "are starting from the assumption that the Russians have already achieved, or are rapidly achieving, intercontinental military superiority with missiles."

The newspaper said: "When U.S. officials have lost confidence in the United States winning any conflict that may occur in the coming years, and begin to doubt whether we can survive and when is the appropriate time to surrender, this is a significant and shocking turn of events."

After the news spread, U.S. President Eisenhower, fearing that the world would know that the United States was actually studying the issue of surrender in war, exposed that U.S. imperialism was nothing more than a paper tiger, and that the imperialist camp would be shaken. Therefore, on the 15th, he authorized the White House press secretary to issue a statement, trying to cover up the matter by saying that "this talk about surrender is complete nonsense."

However, the White House statement directly contradicted the remarks of a Department of Defense spokesman the previous day, who confirmed on the 14th that such research had indeed been conducted.

Eisenhower, greatly angered by the exposure of this matter, has ordered the head of the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct an immediate investigation. A U.S. senator who revealed the situation said on the 13th: "I have never seen the president so furious. He has turned the Department of Defense upside down and wants to thoroughly investigate the bottom line of this matter." As a result, "senior Pentagon (Department of Defense) officials stopped all other matters for nearly two hours."

### 原子狂人原来是纸老虎　美国研究投降计划　丑事外扬艾森豪威尔暴跳如雷

　　原子狂人原来是纸老虎
　　美国研究投降计划
　　丑事外扬艾森豪威尔暴跳如雷
    据新华社18日讯  华盛顿消息：美国报纸最近报道，美国国防部正在研究美国在未来核战争中不得不投降的问题，这个反映美国军事当局丧失信心的事件在美国统治集团内引起了一场骚动。
    根据“圣路易邮报”刊载的消息，受美国国防部委托的三个科学机构正在研究假如爆发核战争“美国是否能存在下去”以及“在什么条件下投降比试图继续进行一场已经失败的战争更得当一些”的问题。报纸说，正在从事这种研究的科学家们“是从这种假设出发的：俄国人已经依靠导弹取得了或者正在迅速取得洲际军事优势”。
    这家报纸说：“当美国官员们已经丧失了美国在今后数年中所可能碰到的任何冲突中取得胜利的信心，开始怀疑我们是不是能够存在下去以及什么时候是投降的恰当时间的时候，这是一件具有重大意义和令人震惊的事态的转变。”
    这个消息传播开来以后，美国总统艾森豪威尔害怕让世界知道美国居然在研究战争中的投降问题，就揭穿了美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎，帝国主义阵营内部将发生动摇，因此，他在15日授权白宫新闻秘书发表声明竭力掩饰说，“这种关于投降的说法完全是无稽之谈”。
    但是白宫的声明是同前一天国防部发言人的谈话直接矛盾的，这个发言人14日证实：确实进行过这种研究。
    由于这件事情的暴露而十分恼怒的艾森豪威尔已经下令美国国防部负责人立即进行调查。一位透露情况的美国参议员13日说：“我从来没有看到总统这样暴怒过。他把国防部搞得天翻地复，要彻底查明这件事的底细。”结果，“五角大楼（国防部）高级官员把所有旁的事情都停顿了将近两小时”。
