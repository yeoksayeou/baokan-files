Superstition Must Be Thoroughly Eliminated
Lin Mo

The scientific research personnel of the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute have created a brilliant achievement in the field of water gas synthesis research. Most of the people engaged in this research work are young researchers. They broke the superstition of the scientific "authorities" of the British and American capitalist countries, boldly researched and carried out creative work, and, under the leadership and support of the Party, bravely moved forward. After thousands of experiments, they finally achieved gratifying results.

Practice is the foundation of science. It is these young researchers who cultivated this scientific flower. They carried out scientific practice with their hard work. This once again proves the truth that science comes from practice. Those who see clearly the laws of development of objective things will not find it difficult to understand this scientific truth. However, some scientific workers do not see the problem in this way.

Those who are superstitious about books regard existing, ready-made book theories as being above all else, while regarding the lively and active life practice and scientific practice that produce scientific theories as insignificant. Those who are superstitious about Europe and America disregard the life practice and scientific research practice of the broad masses of the people, and blindly worship the scientific theories of the United States and British capitalist countries whose economic and cultural life is in a state of stagnation. There are two kinds of people like this in the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute, whose creeds are: "Only theory is high" and "Only foreign things are good." When everyone wanted to kick away this creed and carry out bold research and creative experiments, they, like sorcerers summoning their gods, brought out the "authority" of the American and British scientists they believed in to scare people, saying that dozens of large American companies had invested a lot of manpower and financial resources in research, but failed to achieve satisfactory results. What can we achieve? In the eyes of these people, China's scientific research work should only follow behind the British and American scientists. We can slowly learn to do what others have already done; it is best not to even think about what others have not yet done.

However, the young scientific workers, who were regarded as "baseless meddlers" by these people, dared to think boldly and act boldly, and the results of their work greatly exceeded those of the United States and Britain. What does this prove? It only proves that those who are superstitious about American and British scientific authorities have completely gone bankrupt!

The Great Leap Forward in our country's industrial and agricultural production and scientific and cultural undertakings has created countless rich facts, proving the one-sidedness and limitations of book knowledge, and proving the backwardness and unreliability of certain European and American scientific technologies. In the face of these facts, the above-mentioned two types of people who do not value production practice and scientific practice should sober up and thoroughly eliminate superstition.

    应该彻底破除迷信了
    林沫
    大连石油研究所的科学研究人员对水煤气合成研究的成果，在世界科学研究的园地上开出了一朵鲜花。从事这项研究工作的人大多是一些年轻的研究人员。他们破除了对英、美资本主义国家科学“权威”的迷信，大胆研究，进行创造性的劳动，在党的领导和支持下，勇往直前，经过上千次的试验，终于获得了可喜的成果。
    实践是科学之本。培植出这朵科学之花的，就是这些年轻的研究人员。他们以自己的艰苦劳动，进行了科学实践。这就再次证明了科学出自实践的真理。看清客观事物发展规律的人，是不难懂得这个科学道理的。但是有些科学工作者，却不是这样看问题。
    迷信书本的人，把已有的、现成的书本理论看得超乎一切之上，而对于产生科学理论的那种生动活泼的生活实践、科学实践，却看成微不足道。迷信欧美的人，却对广大人民的生活实践和科学研究的实践，不放在眼里；而对于经济、文化生活处在停滞阶段的美、英资本主义国家的科学理论却盲目崇拜。大连石油研究所就有这么两种人，他们的信条是：“唯有理论高”、“唯有外国行”。当大家要踢开这种信条、进行大胆研究和创造性的试验的时候，他们就像巫师搬出自己的神灵一样，把自己所信奉的美、英科学家的“权威”拿出来吓唬人，说什么美国几十家大公司投入大量的人力、财力进行研究，都得不出满意的成果，我们还能搞出什么来呢？在这些人看来，中国的科学研究工作，只应该跟在英、美科学家的屁股后面。别人已经作到的，我们才可以慢慢学着作；别人还没有作到的，最好连想都不要想。
    但是，被这般人视为“毫无根据的乱通”的年轻的科学工作者，居然大胆地想了，又大胆地干了，而干的结果又大大超过了美国和英国。这证明什么呢？只有证明那些迷信美、英科学权威的人，彻底破了产！
    我国工农业生产和科学文化事业的大跃进，创造了无数的丰富的事实，证明书本知识的片面性和局限性，证明欧美某些科学技术的落后和不可靠。在这些事实面前，上述不重视生产实践和科学实践的两种人，都应该清醒一下头脑，彻底破除迷信了。
