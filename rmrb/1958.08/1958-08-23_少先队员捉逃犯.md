　　Young Pioneers Catch an Escaped Prisoner

　　One afternoon, school was dismissed at Yangdong Elementary School in Shizhu County, Sichuan Province. Three Young Pioneers were chatting as they walked, and unknowingly reached Yanghe Creek. Just after they crossed the river, they noticed a person on the riverbank, looking around suspiciously. The young girl Ou Yilan became alert. She thought, "Ah! The police uncles said that we must always be vigilant and not easily let go of anyone who looks suspicious. Could this person be an escaped prisoner?" They immediately ran over and asked, "Where are you going?" "I'm going to Shuanghe Township," the person replied. They suddenly didn't know how to ask further. Just as they were hesitating, the quick-witted Chen Yizhong interjected, "Why don't you take the main road if you're going to Shuanghe Township? What are you doing looking around on the riverbank?" The person saw that they were just little kids, and casually replied in a dismissive manner, which further aroused the suspicion of the three Young Pioneers. Chen Yizhong immediately pressed, "What's your name? Where do you live? Where did you come from?" The person again answered haphazardly. "You're a bad person, you're trying to escape, aren't you?!" The impatient Liu Xingyun shouted like a thunderclap. The person panicked and turned to leave. How could they let a bad person escape the law? Chen Yizhong leaped forward and grabbed the person's clothes tightly. Suddenly, with a thud, Chen Yizhong was punched by the person, and he fell to the ground, but he still held onto the person's clothes tightly. At this time, Ou Yilan and Liu Xingyun pounced over like two little tigers. They engaged in a fierce struggle with the person, shouting, "Catch the prisoner! Catch the prisoner!" The four of them wrestled into a ball. The person struggled desperately, but without success. At this tense moment, members of the agricultural cooperative who were working nearby heard the shouts and rushed over. They, along with the Young Pioneers, tied up the person.

　　After questioning, the person was indeed an escaped prisoner from the Yangdong Labor Reform Farm. (Li Binxiang)

　　少先队员捉逃犯
    一天下午，四川省石砫县洋洞小学放学了。三个少先队员边走边摆谈着，不知不觉到了杨合溪。他们刚过了河，便发现河岸上有一个人东张西望，鬼鬼祟祟。小姑娘欧一兰警觉起来，她想：“啊！民警叔叔说过，要时刻警惕着，看见形迹可疑的人不要轻易放过。这个人是不是逃跑的犯人呢？”他们立即跑过去问：“你到那里去？”“我到双河乡去。”那人回答。一下不知怎样再问下去，正犹豫时，机智的陈一中抢着便问：“你到双河乡为什么不走大路，在河边东张西望干什么？”那人看到是几个小娃娃，带理不理的随便应付了一句，这更引起了三个少先队员的怀疑。陈一中又立即追问：“你叫什么名字？家住那里？从什么地方来？”那人又胡乱对答了一番。“你是个坏人，想逃跑是不是？！”急性子的刘兴云放出了一个响雷。那人惊慌了，扭头就走。怎么能叫坏人逃脱法网呢？陈一中向前一跃，紧紧抓住那人的衣服。忽然，砰地一下，陈一中被那人打了一拳，他倒在地上了，但是他仍然死死地拉住那人的衣服不放，这时欧一兰、刘兴云像两只小老虎一样，一齐扑过去，他们一面和那人展开激烈的搏斗，一面高喊：“捉犯人啊！捉犯人啊！”四人扭打成一团，那人拼命挣扎，都没有成功。正在紧张万分的时候，在附近搞生产的农业社员闻声赶到了，他们和少先队员一起把那人捆了起来。
    经过询问，那人果然是洋洞劳改农场的逃犯。　（李斌祥）
