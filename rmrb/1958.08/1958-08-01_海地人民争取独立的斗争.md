    The Republic of Haiti is located in the western part of the island of Hispaniola in the Central American Caribbean, covering an area of approximately 27,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 3.35 million, 95% of whom are black. It is the only black republic in the Americas.
    Haiti's attainment of independence was the result of a long struggle.
    In 1492, Haiti became a Spanish colony. Fifteen years later, almost all of the original one million indigenous people had been brutally tortured to death by the colonizers. From the early 16th century onwards, the invaders continuously transported large numbers of black slaves from Africa to engage in labor in order to mine gold and plant sugarcane. At the end of the 17th century, French colonizers seized Haiti from Spain.
    In 1804, the Haitian people launched an uprising and overthrew the rule of the French colonizers. In 1806, they declared the establishment of a republic, becoming the first black republic in the world.
    However, on July 3, 1915, the United States illegally occupied Haiti by armed force, savagely shooting progressive leaders, disbanding democratic organizations, and supporting reactionary forces in the country. At the same time, American capital established various companies in Haiti, controlling the entire economy of the republic. American advisors determined Haiti's economic development and exercised control in government agencies and the military.
    The Haitian people did not yield to the American imperialists. They continuously launched uprisings, bravely fighting one after another, and finally forced the American troops to withdraw from Haiti in 1934.
    After this, the United States adopted the method of supporting puppet governments in Haiti to maintain its political and economic control over the country. The dictatorial president Magloire, who came to power in 1950, established a brutal military dictatorship domestically, relied on the United States externally, hired American advisory groups to manage financial affairs, and signed military treaties with the United States. In December 1956, Magloire's term of office as president expired. However, he arrogantly seized military power, attempting to continue serving as president.
    In order to resist Magloire's dictatorial rule, a general strike broke out in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. The dictator's armed suppression and mass arrests did not intimidate the Haitian people. Magloire was finally driven away. After Magloire stepped down, Haiti was filled with political crises. The patriotic forces of Haiti and the pro-American forces supporting the dictatorial rule engaged in arduous and complex struggles. Six governments appeared successively within half a year, and finally, on September 22, 1957, Duvalier was elected president. (Xi)

    海地人民争取独立的斗争
    海地位于中美洲中部加勒比海的海地岛西部，面积约二万七千多平方公里，全国人口约三百三十五万，黑人占95％。它是美洲唯一的黑人的共和国。
    海地成为一个独立的国家，曾经经过了长期的斗争。
    1492年海地沦为西班牙殖民地，十五年后，原有的一百万印第安人几乎全被殖民者残酷地折磨死了。侵略者为了开采金矿和栽种甘蔗，从十六世纪初期以来就陆续自非洲贩运了大批黑人奴隶从事劳役。在十七世纪末，法国殖民者从西班牙手中夺取了海地。
    1804年，海地人民举行了起义，推翻了法国殖民者的统治。1806年，宣布成立共和国，成为世界上第一个黑人共和国。
    但是，1915年7月3日，美国竟非法武装占领了海地，并在这个国家里野蛮地枪杀进步领袖，解散民主组织，支持反动势力。同时，美国资本在海地开设了各种公司，掌握了共和国的全部经济。美国顾问决定海地的经济发展，并在政府机关和军队中实行控制。
    海地人民并没有对美帝国主义者屈服，他们不断举行起义，前仆后继地进行英勇斗争，终于迫使美军在1934年撤出了海地。
    在这以后，美国就采用在海地扶植傀儡政府的办法，来保持对这个国家的政治和经济的控制。1950年上台的独裁总统马格罗阿在国内建立了残酷的军事独裁，对外依附美国，聘用美国顾问团主持财政事务，和美国签订军事条约。1956年12月马格罗阿行使总统职权的期限届满。但他专横地夺取了军权，企图继续担任总统。
    为了反抗马格罗阿的独裁统治，海地首都太子港爆发了大罢工。独裁者的武装镇压和大逮捕，都没吓倒海地人民。马格罗阿终于被撵走了。马格罗阿下台后，海地国内一直充满着政治危机。海地爱国力量和拥护独裁统治的亲美势力之间进行了艰苦、复杂的斗争，在半年内先后出现了六个政府，最后在1957年9月22日选出杜瓦利埃担任总统。　（锡）
