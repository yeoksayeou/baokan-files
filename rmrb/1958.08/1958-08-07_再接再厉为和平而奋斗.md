    In view of the fact that the United States and British governments have refused to convene a five-power summit conference, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in a letter to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France on the 5th, advocated the immediate convening of an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of American and British aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan. On the same day, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, also requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider the Soviet proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. As the American and British aggressors not only refuse to convene a summit conference but also intensify the reinforcement of troops to the Middle East, the Soviet proposal is obviously a very timely and powerful measure. This is another action by the Soviet Union to continue its efforts to strive for peace. All peace-loving people should take action to urge the United Nations General Assembly to fulfill its solemn responsibility to maintain international peace and security, to stop the aggression of the United States and Britain, so as to eliminate the tense situation in the Middle East and the threat of war created by the United States and Britain.

    Stopping the American and British aggression against the Middle East is the urgent task of maintaining peace in the Middle East and the world. Since the American and British aggression against the Middle East, the Soviet government has taken a series of emergency actions aimed at maintaining world peace, and has repeatedly suggested holding a five-power summit conference in order to take immediate measures to stop the imminent war crisis. The Soviet government's proposal has been supported by peace-loving people and governments of many countries around the world. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and French Prime Minister de Gaulle also agreed to hold a five-power summit conference. The Soviet government believes that as long as a five-power summit conference can be convened, it would be acceptable to hold such a meeting within the scope of the Security Council. What is important is the content of the meeting, not its form. However, the heads of the American and British governments have tried to use a special meeting of the Security Council to fundamentally cancel the five-power summit conference. Khrushchev pointed out in his reply to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France on July 28 that the approach taken by the American and British governments is in essence a rejection of the summit conference. They want to use this to paralyze the people's vigilance and secretly plan new aggressive actions. After their plot was exposed, the heads of the American and British governments still insisted on their original position. In their replies to Khrushchev on July 31 and August 1, Macmillan and Eisenhower once again adopted an opposing attitude towards the convening of a five-power summit conference, and continued to advocate convening a special meeting of the Security Council. They shamelessly posed as protectors of small countries, claiming that a great power conference to ease the tense situation was "disregarding the wishes, dignity, and security of small countries," attempting to fundamentally undermine the convening of the great power conference. This means that they stubbornly refuse the Soviet Union's peace efforts in order to continue their aggressive actions in the Middle East.

    Everyone can see that the current composition of the Security Council cannot effectively solve the urgent problem it faces of stopping American and British aggression against the Middle East. Before the Soviet Union proposed convening a five-power summit conference, the Security Council had already discussed the situation in the Middle East, but it did not reach any results that would help maintain world peace. This is because many countries in the Security Council that participated in the military bloc controlled by the United States, as well as some countries that depend on the United States, are actually acting according to the wishes of the American and British aggressors under the pressure of the United States. Moreover, there is also a political zombie – the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique – who was forcibly stuffed into the permanent seat of the Security Council by the United States. This makes it impossible for this international organization that maintains international peace and security to avoid being paralyzed. In this case, this international organization not only cannot reflect the peace-loving aspirations of the people of all countries, but on the contrary, it is used by the United States to serve its aggressive purposes. The heads of the American and British governments have repeatedly insisted on replacing the summit conference with a special meeting of the Security Council, precisely because they want to use the Security Council meeting to cover up their aggressive actions. The American "Stars and Stripes" reporter Flye said frankly in a report on July 27 that only by turning the highest-level meeting into the usual special meeting of the Security Council can the United States and Britain "avoid a crushing defeat" and make the meeting "useful" to the United States and Britain.

    How do the American and British aggressors intend to use the special meeting of the Security Council? U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on July 31: "This meeting... will break the fictitious claim that the United States or the United Kingdom is engaged in armed aggression, and I hope it will take steps to be able to eliminate indirect aggression through the United Nations or some international organization." Dulles also said: "There should be a permanent United Nations force, which can go to any place where it feels threatened by this indirect aggression, and establish a safety net around it." Obviously, the so-called "breaking" the "fictitious claim" of American and British aggression is to try to wash away the aggressive guilt of the United States and Britain; the so-called "taking steps" to eliminate "indirect aggression" is to legalize the aggressive crimes of the United States and Britain. Everyone knows that the American and British dispatch of troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan is based on the excuse of preventing so-called "indirect aggression." Therefore, it is clear that the American and British governments' proposal to convene a special meeting of the Security Council is not at all a sign of stopping aggression and accepting peace, but an attempt to find a "legal" excuse and, under the guise of some "permanent United Nations force," to expand their aggressive actions.

    In fact, the American and British aggressors are actively preparing to expand their aggressive actions. The American and British aggressors have had to slap themselves in the face and admit the government of the Republic of Iraq, which they once falsely accused of carrying out "indirect aggression" against Iraq. After manipulating the presidential election in Lebanon, U.S. President's Special Envoy Murphy is still carrying out ulterior motives in the Middle East. The American propaganda machine is trying its best to portray these as signs that the situation in the Middle East has eased. However, what is impossible to explain is that, under the condition that the United States and Britain have recognized the Republic of Iraq (their only "reason" for armed intervention was originally the overthrow of Iraq's "legitimate" dynasty), under the condition that the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon has once again submitted a report confirming that there is no so-called foreign "infiltration" in Lebanon, under the condition that the American and British aggressors themselves are also promoting that the situation in the Middle East has eased, in short, under the condition that any of the American and British aggressors' excuses for occupying Lebanon and Jordan have gone bankrupt, the American and British aggressors are not only unwilling to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, but are instead sending a large number of troops to Lebanon and Jordan! In recent days, the United States has increased the number of troops occupying Lebanon from 10,000 to 14,000, and most of the newly added troops are equipped with heavy weapons. U.S. President's Special Envoy Murphy and the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, who originally claimed that they would withdraw their troops after the Lebanese presidential election, are now silent about the time of withdrawal, which proves that their original propaganda was entirely to fool the Lebanese opposition and deceive world public opinion. Their purpose is to occupy Lebanon indefinitely. While reinforcing troops to Jordan, Britain also occupied Aqaba, Jordan's only external passage. These actions by the American and British aggressors have made the situation in the Middle East even more tense. In this case, peace-loving people and countries that are truly concerned about peace must be vigilant against the conspiracies of the American and British aggressors.

    Time waits for no one! The situation in the Middle East continues to be in a dangerous state due to the American and British aggressors' preparations to expand their aggressive actions. People all over the world urgently demand an early end to this dangerous state. And the only way to end this state is to make the American and British aggressive troops withdraw from the Middle East immediately. The Soviet Union's request to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of American and British aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan is precisely a necessary measure that addresses the problem. The United States and the United Kingdom dare not refuse the Soviet proposal, but they are conspiring to shift the goal, so that the United Nations General Assembly will not discuss the withdrawal of the American and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan, but will discuss the so-called "interference in Lebanon's internal affairs" by the Arab United Republic. On the one hand, this shows to what extent the American and British imperialists have degenerated to shamelessness, and on the other hand, it fully exposes that they not only want to continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, but also conspire to expand their aggression against the UAR. The urgent task of peace-loving people all over the world at present is: to continue to work hard to completely smash the conspiracy of the American and British aggressors, to resolutely demand that the American and British aggressor troops withdraw from the Middle East, and to step up the struggle to stop American and British aggression and strive for peace!

### 再接再厉为和平而奋斗

    再接再厉为和平而奋斗
    鉴于美国和英国政府已经拒绝召开一次五大国政府首脑会议，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在5日写给美、英、法政府首脑的信中，主张立即召开联合国大会紧急会议，来讨论美英侵略军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退的问题。同一天，苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫并已要求召开安全理事会紧急会议，来考虑苏联提出的关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议。在美英侵略者一面拒绝召开大国政府首脑会议，一面又在加紧向中东增兵的情况下，苏联的建议显然是一个十分适时而有力的措施。这是苏联再接再厉地为争取和平而努力的又一行动。所有爱好和平人民应当行动起来，督促联合国大会履行它的维护国际和平与安全的庄严职责，制止美英的侵略，以消除中东的紧张局势和美英所造成的战争威胁。
    制止美英对中东的侵略是维护中东和世界和平的刻不容缓的任务。苏联政府在美英侵略中东以来，已经采取了一系列旨在维护世界和平的紧急行动，并一再建议召开五大国政府首脑会议，以便马上采取措施，制止一触即发的战争危机。苏联政府的建议曾经得到了全世界爱好和平人民和许多国家政府的支持。印度总理尼赫鲁和法国总理戴高乐也都同意召开五国政府首脑会议。苏联政府认为，只要能够召集五大国政府首脑会议，那么这种会议在安理会范围内举行也无不可，重要的是会议的内容而不是它的形式。但是，美英政府首脑却力图利用安理会特别会议来根本取消五大国政府首脑会议。赫鲁晓夫在7月28日答复美、英、法政府首脑的信中就曾指出，美英政府所采取的这种方针实质上就是拒绝政府首脑会议的方针，并想借此麻痹人民的警惕性，偷偷地策划新的侵略行动。美英政府首脑在他们的这种图谋被揭穿之后，却依然坚持他们原来的立场。麦克米伦在7月31日、艾森豪威尔在8月1日给赫鲁晓夫的复信中，再一次对召开五大国政府首脑会议的问题采取了反对的态度，而继续主张召开安理会特别会议，并且无耻地冒充小国的保护人，宣称为和缓紧张局势服务的大国会议是“无视小国的愿望、尊严、安全”，企图根本破坏大国会议的召开。这就是说，他们顽固地拒绝苏联的和平努力，以便在中东继续进行他们的侵略行动。
    谁都看得出，目前的安理会的组成情况是不能有效地解决它面临制止美英侵略中东的紧急的问题的。安理会在苏联提出召开五大国政府首脑会议的建议之前，就曾进行过关于中东局势的讨论，可是并没有得出任何有助于维护世界和平的结果。这是由于安理会中许多参加了美国所操纵的军事集团的国家以及一些依附美国的国家，在美国的压力下，实际上是看着美英侵略者的颜色行事的。并且，在安理会里还有一个被美国硬塞在常任理事席位上的政治僵尸——蒋介石卖国集团的代表。这就使得这个维持国际和平与安全的国际机构不能不陷于瘫痪状态。在这种情况下，这个国际机构不但不能体现各国人民爱好和平的愿望，相反的，它却被美国利用来为它的侵略目的效劳。美英政府首脑一再坚持要以安理会特别会议来代替大国政府首脑会议，就是想利用安理会会议为他们的侵略行动作掩护。美国“明星报”记者弗莱在7月27日的报道中就曾毫不讳言地说，只有使最高级会议变为通常的安理会特别会议，才能使美英“免遭惨败”，并使这个会议成为对美英“有用处的会议”。
    美英侵略者企图怎样利用安理会特别会议呢？美国国务卿杜勒斯在7月31日的记者招待会上说：“这个会议……将会打破关于美国或者联合王国在进行武装侵略的虚构说法，而且我希望它会采取步骤以便能够通过联合国或某种国际机构消除间接侵略”。杜勒斯还说：“应该有一支常设的联合国部队，什么地方感到受到这种间接侵略的威胁，它就可以到什么地方去，在那里的周围建立一种安全保护网”。很显然，所谓“打破”美英侵略的“虚构说法”，就是要设法洗刷掉美英的侵略罪责；所谓“采取步骤”来消除“间接侵略”，就是要使美英的侵略罪行合法化。谁都知道，美英派兵侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，就是以防止所谓“间接侵略”作为借口的。因此很明白，美英政府主张召开安理会特别会议，完全不是要停止侵略和接受和平的表示，而是企图寻找“合法”的借口，并在什么“常设的联合国部队”的掩饰下，来扩大它们的侵略行动。
    事实上美英侵略者正在积极准备扩大它们的侵略行动。美英侵略者已不得不自打耳光，承认了他们曾经诬指为对伊拉克进行了“间接侵略”的伊拉克共和国政府。美国总统特使墨菲在操纵了黎巴嫩的总统选举之后，还在中东继续进行不可告人的阴谋活动。美国的宣传机器竭力把这些说成是中东局势已经缓和的迹象。但是，无法解释的是，在美英已经承认伊拉克共和国（它们的武装干涉的唯一“理由”本来就是伊拉克的“合法”王朝被推翻）的条件下，在联合国黎巴嫩观察团再次提出报告证实在黎巴嫩没有所谓外国“渗入”的条件下，在美英侵略者自己也宣传中东局势已经缓和的情况下，总之，在美英侵略者任何关于占领黎巴嫩和约旦的借口都已经破产了的条件下，美英侵略者却不但不肯从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退他们的军队，相反的还在大量地向黎巴嫩和约旦增派军队！这几日来，美国已把侵占黎巴嫩的军队从一万人增加到一万四千人，并且新增的部队大部分配备了重型武器。原来宣称黎巴嫩总统选举后就将撤兵的美国总统特使墨菲和美国驻黎大使馆，现在绝口不谈撤军时间，这就证明他们原先的宣传完全是为了愚弄黎巴嫩的反对派和欺骗世界舆论，他们的目的就是无限期地占领黎巴嫩。英国在向约旦增兵的同时，还侵占了约旦唯一的对外通道亚喀巴。美英侵略者的这些行动，已使中东的局势更加紧张了。在这种情况下，各国爱好和平的人民和真正关心和平的国家都必须警惕美英侵略者的阴谋。
    时间是不等人的！中东的局势由于美英侵略者准备扩大侵略的行动而继续处在危险的状态中。全世界人民迫切要求早日结束这种危险的状态。而要结束这种状态的唯一办法就是使美英侵略军队立即撤出中东。苏联要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，来讨论美英侵略军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题，正是对症下药的必要措施。美国和英国政府不敢拒绝苏联的建议，但是它们正阴谋转移目标，使联合国大会不是讨论美英侵略军从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退，而是讨论所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉黎巴嫩内政”问题。这一方面固然表明了美英帝国主义已经堕落到何等无耻的地步，另一方面又充分暴露了他们不但要继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，而且还阴谋扩大侵略阿联。全世界爱好和平的人民当前的紧急任务是：再接再厉，彻底粉碎美英侵略者的阴谋，坚决要求美英侵略军撤出中东，为制止美英侵略、争取和平而加紧斗争！
