Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 12th. Ten thousand workers of the British-owned Calcutta Tram Company in the large Indian city of Calcutta went on strike today. All four national trade unions in India—the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, and the United Trades Union Congress—have formed a committee to support the strike.

The workers are demanding that the British-owned Tram Company accept the court's ruling on the company's labor disputes, improve working conditions, issue bonuses, and establish a full-power committee to study all of the workers' demands.

Tram workers have been campaigning for the past four or five months, demanding an investigation into the company's income, but the company authorities have refused their demands.

Reports say that the Calcutta Tram Company's profits have been increasing year by year, while the number of trams has not increased. Income in 1957 increased by 800,000 rupees compared to 1956. According to an agreement with the West Bengal government, the company can continue to operate until 1972.

　　要求英国老板接受法院裁决
　　加尔各答电车工人罢工
    新华社新德里12日电　印度大城市加尔各答的一万名英商电车公司工人今天举行罢工。印度的所有四个全国性工会——全印工会大会、印度全国工会大会、印度劳工协会和统一工会大会——组成了委员会支持罢工。
    工人们要求英商电车公司接受法院对这家公司的劳资纠纷的裁决，改进工作条件，发给奖金，成立全权委员会研究工人的一切要求。
    电车工人在过去四、五个月以来一直在进行活动，要求调查公司的收入，但是公司当局拒绝了他们的要求。
    有消息说，加尔各答电车公司的利润年年增加，而电车的数量却没有增加。1957年的收入就比1956年增加了八十万卢比。根据同西孟加拉邦政府的协议，这家公司可以继续经营到1972年为止。
