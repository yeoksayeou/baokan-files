A surge of industrial and commercial bankruptcies is violently battering Taiwan, where the people struggle for survival. Opening the latest Taiwan newspapers, aside from the endless stream of social news about suicides, homicides, robberies, and scandals, the newspapers in Taipei also carry numerous news reports and commentaries on the growing wave of factory and shop closures sweeping Taiwan. Just the news headlines alone, such as "Gale of bankruptcies sweeps across regions," "Taichung's bankruptcy storm intensifies, wave of closures," "Bankruptcies batter leather and textile industries, four factories halt production," "Over thirty more closures in Taipei," are enough to be alarming.

The difficult situation of Taiwan's industry and commerce has been apparent for several years, with factories and shops constantly collapsing. However, the wave of bankruptcies has never been as turbulent as it has been in the past month or so. Taiwan newspapers report that more than 300 factories and shops closed down across Taiwan province last year. From January to May this year, 358 had already closed in Taipei alone. But since June, the gale has become even more severe, with an estimated 1,000 factories and shops across the province closing down in June and July.

It is worth noting that among the factories and shops that have closed in the past month or so, many have been operating for a long time and are considered to have substantial capital and better credit in the Taiwan market. They had survived the ups and downs of the Taiwan market for several years, but now they can no longer hold on. For example, the Taoyuan Leather Factory and Jingmei Leather Processing Factory, which closed on July 17, are the largest leather factories in Taiwan. The Shilin Textile and Dyeing Factory and the Fengyuan Textile and Dyeing Company, which closed on the same day, are also quite large in scale and well-known in Taiwan's textile industry. Another characteristic is that this fierce bankruptcy storm has caused many of Taiwan's industries to collapse by more than half. Taiwan's industrial and commercial groups recently held several symposiums to discuss ways to save Taiwan's unprecedentedly severe industrial and commercial crisis. The capitalists attending the symposiums were all frowning, sighing, and unable to come up with any solutions. The representative of the Taiwan Soap Industry at the symposium said: "More than 70 of Taiwan's 140 soap factories have already closed down, and only 60 or so are struggling to survive in a semi-operational state. Not only are small factories closing down, but even large factories are closing down one after another." Representatives from the wool textile industry, weaving industry, leather industry, and shoe industry also stated that more than half of the factories in their respective industries had closed down. The majority of Taiwan's tea factories have also closed down. In terms of shops, department stores and service industries such as clothing stores and restaurants have seen the most closures. Famous department stores in Taipei, such as the Da Zhonghua Department Store and the Jiu Da Department Store, have closed down not long ago.

Why has the wave of industrial and commercial bankruptcies in Taiwan been so fierce recently? Taipei's "Independence Evening News" published a commentary titled "Product Stagnation - The Main Cause of Bankruptcies," stating: "The bankruptcy storm, like an influenza epidemic, has spread throughout Taiwan's entire industry and commerce. The severity of it is chilling. The formation of the bankruptcy storm is due to the small market, the social recession, and the weak purchasing power, resulting in products going unsold. This is the most serious problem. When businessmen talk about their business experiences in the past six months, they all frown and complain incessantly." The wave of industrial and commercial bankruptcies in Taiwan reflects the extreme poverty of the Taiwanese people under the rule of the US-Chiang regime and the unprecedentedly low purchasing power. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the factories and shops closing down the most are textile factories, fabric stores, clothing stores, department stores, lower and middle-class restaurants, and shoe stores.

The Chiang Kai-shek clique's policy of imposing heavy taxes on Taiwan's industry and commerce, killing the goose to get the eggs, is also one of the main reasons for the fierce bankruptcy storm in the Taiwan market. The chairman of a Taiwan wool textile factory said that the Taiwan textile industry was also dragged down by heavy taxes, with tax rates on textiles as high as 120% of the cost. From the time a piece of cloth leaves the factory to the time it is sold in a fabric store in Taiwan, it has to pay more than ten kinds of taxes. The heavy taxes in other industries are also similar. Several large Taiwan companies, such as Tongfeng Enterprise Company and Hua Nan Textile Factory, have recently been closed down by the Chiang Kai-shek clique for tax arrears.

Some Taiwan factories were dragged down and swallowed up by so-called "US aid." The Minsheng Steel Plant in Kaohsiung borrowed 600,000 Taiwan dollars of so-called "US aid industrial loans" in 1956. Because the factory had been losing money for years and was unable to repay the loan and interest, the Americans recently used the Kaohsiung District Court of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to seal it up, causing this steel plant, whose total assets were several times higher than the so-called "US aid loan," to fall into the hands of the Americans.

The most fundamental reason for the fierce industrial and commercial bankruptcies in Taiwan is the impact of the US economic recession. The United States not only occupies Taiwan by force but also implements a colonial economic policy in Taiwan. The people of Taiwan are deeply suffering from the economic crisis brought to them by the United States and the pain of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's traitorous and oppressive policies. On the one hand, the Chiang Kai-shek clique levies heavy taxes on the products of Taiwan factories, and on the other hand, it allows US light industrial products to be dumped in Taiwan at low prices under "most favorable terms," squeezing out Taiwan's local industry.

In this wave of industrial and commercial bankruptcies in Taiwan, thousands upon thousands of Taiwan residents are facing the threat of bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation. Suicides due to poverty have also increased significantly in Taiwan in the past month. Recently, a young man named Lin Jingsong, who was not yet twenty years old, committed suicide by poisoning himself in an air-raid shelter in Taipei because he lost his job after the shop he worked in closed down and had no way out. Two young female workers from the Xinfeng Textile Factory in Tainan City could not find jobs anywhere before the factory closed down and starved for many days before drowning themselves. Wang Fucai, a capitalist in Qishan Town, Kaohsiung County, committed suicide by poisoning himself and his wife after his shop closed down. These are just a few examples revealed in recent Taiwan newspapers. Such tragic events happen every day in the cities and towns of Taiwan under the fierce bankruptcy storm.

### 倒风猛袭台湾市场

    倒风猛袭台湾市场
    方元慧
    工商业户倒闭的狂潮，正在猛烈地冲击着民不聊生的台湾各地。翻开最近的台湾报纸，除了层出不穷的自杀、凶杀、抢劫和色情的社会新闻以外，台北市各报也大量登载了台湾工厂商店倒风愈吹愈烈的消息和评论。光是“一片倒风猛袭各地”、“台中倒风愈炽，一窝风的关门”、“倒风猛袭制革纺织工业，四厂分别停止生产”、“台北市又倒三十多家”等新闻标题，也够令人怵目惊心。
    台湾工商业的处境困难，几年来都不断有工厂商店支持不了而倒闭。不过，倒闭的浪潮从来没有像最近一个多月这样汹涌。台湾报纸说，在去年一年内，台湾全省倒闭了三百多家工厂商店。今年1月到5月份，光是台北市已经倒闭了三百五十八家。可是，从6月起倒风更加凄厉了，估计6月和7月全省倒闭的工厂商店达一千多家。
    值得注意的是，在最近一个多月来倒闭的工厂商店中，有许多都是开设时间较长，在台湾市场上算是资金较厚，比较有信誉的工商业户。它们在几年来台湾市场的风风雨雨中，都没有倒下来，现在终于支撑不住了。如7月17日倒闭的桃园制革厂和景美制革加工厂，都是台湾规模最大的制革工厂。同一天倒闭的士林纺织染厂和丰原纺织整染公司，也都是规模相当大的，在台湾的纺织业中很有名。另外一个特点是，这次狂烈的倒风使台湾的一些行业垮了一大半。台湾的工商业团体最近召开了几次座谈会，商量挽救目前空前严重的台湾工商业危机的办法，出席座谈会的资本家们都愁眉苦脸，唉声叹气，想不出什么办法。出席座谈会的台湾肥皂工业资方代表说：“台湾一百四十多家肥皂厂，已经倒闭了七十多家，只有六十多家还在半开工状态中勉强支持。不但小厂倒闭，连大厂也纷纷倒闭了。”毛纺业、织布业、制革业、皮鞋业的代表也都说明他们本行业的工厂倒闭了一半以上。台湾的制茶工厂更是倒闭了一大半。商店方面，百货商店和服务性行业如服装店、饭店等倒闭最多。台北市著名的大中华百货公司、久大百货公司等，都在不久以前倒闭了。
    为什么台湾的工商业倒风最近会这么猛烈呢？台北市“自立晚报”以“产品滞销——倒风主因”为标题，发表评论说：“倒闭之风，像流行性感冒一样，弥漫了台湾整个工商业，其严重的程度，令人不寒而栗。倒风之形成，是由于市场狭小，社会不景气，购买力薄弱，以致产品无人问津，这是最严重的问题。商人一谈起半年以来的生意经，无不双眉紧蹙，叫苦连天”。台湾工商业的倒风，反映了台湾人民在美蒋统治下生活的极端贫困，购买力空前低落。因此，倒闭的工厂商店最多的是纺织厂、布店、服装店、百货商店、中下级饮食店、鞋店等，并不是偶然的。
    蒋介石集团对台湾工商业采取杀鸡取蛋的苛捐重税政策，也是促成台湾市场倒风猛烈的主要原因之一。台湾毛纺厂董事长说，台湾纺织业也是被重税拖垮的，纺织品的税率高达成本的120％。一匹布在台湾，从出厂到布店出售，要缴纳十多种税捐。其它行业捐税的苛重，也是大同小异。台湾规模相当大的同丰企业公司和华南纺织厂等，最近都因欠税被蒋介石集团封闭了。
    有一些台湾工厂是被所谓“美援”拖垮后吞没的。高雄市民生钢铁厂在1956年借了六十万元台币的所谓“美援工业贷款”，因工厂连年亏本，无力偿还这笔贷款和利息，最近被美国人假手蒋介石集团高雄地方法院判决查封，使这家资产总值比这笔所谓“美援贷款”高好几倍的钢铁厂，落在美国人的手中。
    台湾工商业倒风猛烈的最根本的原因，是受到美国经济衰退的影响。美国不但用武力霸占台湾，而且在台湾施行殖民经济政策。台湾人民正在深受美国带给他们的经济危机的灾难，和蒋介石集团卖国残民的痛苦。蒋介石集团一方面对台湾工厂的产品征收苛重的捐税，另一方面则让美国的轻工业品以“最优惠条件”在台湾贱价倾销，挤垮台湾本土的工业。
    在这次台湾工商业户倒闭的浪潮中，成千上万的台湾居民面临着破产、失业和饥饿的威胁。因贫困而自杀的案件，这一个多月在台湾也有了显著的增加。最近，一个未满二十岁的青年林景松，因他任职的商店倒闭后失业，走投无路而在台北市一个防空洞内服毒自杀。台南市新丰纺织厂的两个青年女工，在这家工厂倒闭前夕，到处找不到职业，挨饿多日，投水死去。高雄县旗山镇资本家王傅财，在商店倒闭后夫妇服毒自杀。这些只不过是在最近台湾报纸上透露的少数例子。像这类悲惨的事件，每天都发生在倒风猛袭下的台湾城市和小镇。
