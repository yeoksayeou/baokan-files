Shang Machao, a sixth-grade student at Qingtou Elementary School in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, dares to think and dares to act, boldly experimenting by grafting tomatoes and potatoes to create "two-story" plants; and grafting cotton onto sunflower seedlings to cultivate black cotton. The surviving "two-story" plants and black cotton seedlings are growing very vigorously.

Shang Machao is fourteen years old this year and a Young Pioneer. He has been working with his father in the orchard since he was a child and loves gardening work very much. At the age of eleven, he successfully bud-grafted pear trees and crabapple trees. In the third grade, he learned the lesson "The Great Horticulturalist," and the deeds of Michurin inspired his interest in scientific research. He grafted Chinese wild peaches onto apple trees, so that two kinds of fruits could grow on one fruit tree. His father had grafted apples and crabapples twice without success, but Machao painstakingly studied a new method, adding a bark tube to the grafted horseshoe-shaped cut, and finally succeeded in grafting.

The clarion call of the Great Leap Forward is inspiring, and Shang Machao is working even harder in the Young Pioneer's small farm. One day, while watering potatoes, he found several wild tomato seedlings in the field. He thought, "Potatoes grow below, so it would be great if we could 'build another story' on top of them – with tomatoes growing on top, so we can harvest two crops from one plant at the same time!" He told his instructor this idea, and received the instructor's approval and support.

When he started grafting, he encountered a problem: the potato stem is soft and weak, can it support the grafted tomato? There was nothing about this problem in the books. He found Zhang Chengquan, a member of his team, to study it together. They used rootstock grafting, cutting the tomato stem into a horseshoe shape with a small knife, then splitting the potato rootstock, inserting the tomato stem, and then tying the interface with tree bark. After diligent management such as protecting against wind, rain, and sun, they grafted five plants and four survived. Machao also used the same method to graft sunflowers and Jerusalem artichokes, grafting four plants, all of which survived. In the autumn, people will see "two-story" plants with tomatoes (or sunflowers) growing above and potatoes (or Jerusalem artichokes) growing below.

Once, Machao and Chengquan thought: it would be great if cotton could grow out black and be woven into black cloth. So they grafted cotton onto black sunflowers, grafting three plants and two survived. They also grafted cotton and red balsams to cultivate red cotton. In addition, they grafted peppers onto tomatoes, which can cultivate large peppers weighing six taels.

Recently, the Qingtou Township Party Branch is organizing agricultural cooperatives to study Shang Machao's spirit and methods of innovation. (Attached picture)

### 尚马朝敢想敢干创奇迹  培育出“两层楼”植物和黑棉花

    尚马朝敢想敢干创奇迹
    培育出“两层楼”植物和黑棉花
    据山西日报消息　山西省解虞县卿头小学六年级学生尚马朝，敢想敢做，大胆试验，把蕃茄与马铃薯嫁接成“两层楼”植物；又把棉花接在向日葵幼苗上，培育出黑色的棉花。现在成活的“两层楼”植物与黑色棉苗长得很茁壮。
    尚马朝今年十四岁，少先队员。从小跟着父亲在果树园里干活，十分热爱园艺工作。十一岁时曾芽接成功梨树和棠梨树。上三年级时，他学了“伟大的园艺家”一课，米丘林的事迹鼓舞了他研究科学的兴趣。他把莱子树嫁接在苹果树上，在一株果树上可以生出两种果子。他的爸爸曾把苹果棠梨嫁接两次都没有成功，马朝苦心地钻研出新办法，把接的马蹄面，加上了树皮筒，终于嫁接成功了。
    大跃进的号角振奋人心，尚马朝在红领巾小农场里劳动也格外起劲。有一天，他浇马铃薯，发现地里有几苗野蕃茄，他想：“马铃薯是结在下面的，要能再给它‘盖上一层楼’——把蕃茄结在它上面，一株植物同时收两种作物，多好啊！”他把这个想法告诉辅导员，得到辅导员的赞同和支持。
    开始嫁接时，就遇到了难题：马铃薯茎软枝弱，接上蕃茄能不能撑住呢？这个问题书上也没有。他就找本队队员张成全一起研究。他们用根茎嫁接，把蕃茄茎用小刀削成马蹄形，再劈开马铃薯根茎，插在蕃茄茎上，然后用树皮扎好接口。经过防风、防雨、防日晒等辛勤管理，结果嫁接了五株，成活了四株。马朝又用同样方法，把向日葵和洋姜嫁接，接了四株，全都活了。秋后人们将会看见上面结着蕃茄（或向日葵）下面长着马铃薯（或洋姜）的“两层楼”植物。
    有一次，马朝和成全想：棉花开出来就是黑色的，织成黑布那该多好。于是他们把棉花嫁接在黑向日葵上，嫁接三株活了两株。他们还把棉花和红凤仙嫁接，要培育出红色棉花。另外，又把辣椒接在蕃茄上，可以培育出六两重的大辣椒。
    最近，卿头乡党支部正组织农业社学习尚马朝的革新精神和方法。（附图片）
