Strengthening Folk Art Work

The great leap forward in production since last winter and this spring has brought about a great leap forward in culture, and a surging cultural revolution movement has begun. The emergence of a large number of new folk songs is one of the important symbols of this cultural revolution movement. Many counties have produced hundreds of thousands of folk songs in just a few months from the beginning of this year to the present. Folk singers and ballad poets have shown their talents, and party committee secretaries have taken the lead in creating. A wave of mass creation has formed throughout the country. Many provinces, counties, and even townships and communes have published local collections of folk songs, and many factories and mines have also published literary journals for amateur writers. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in Chinese cultural history.

The vigorous development of new folk songs is particularly noteworthy. It is a vivid reflection of the great leap forward in production, and also a reflection of the rising spirit of communism among the masses. The working people skillfully and ingeniously use the forms they are familiar with and love to express their inspiration from production and construction, their thoughts, feelings and desires in the form of poetry, singing about labor, singing about the new relationships between people and people, people and nature, singing about communist new things, and singing about the leadership of the Party. The new folk songs reflect the enthusiasm of the masses and, in turn, inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, powerfully promoting the development of production and construction. They are tools of political mobilization and the best poems.

Folk songs are the collective creation of the working people. In the old days, the working people were deprived of the right to learn culture due to class exploitation and oppression. They could only use their songs to express their deep hatred for oppressors and exploiters and their dreams for a better life. For thousands of years, many excellent folk literature works have been circulating among the masses, which is a treasure in our national cultural tradition. However, due to the limitations of the times, these works could not, of course, express the working people's comfortable mood and heroic spirit of being masters of their own affairs, conquering nature, and building a new life like today's mass creation. In today's mass creation, we can see the revolutionary and communist worldview of the authors. This is a brand-new literature, a product of the crystallization of physical labor and mental labor aimed at building socialism and communism. Communist literature and art are based on the combination of physical and mental labor. The new folk songs created by millions and tens of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers can be said to be the buds of communist literature and art. They show us the incomparably broad road for the prosperity of future communist literature and art. The old concept of folk literature is no longer entirely suitable for today's mass art creation. We should give the highest evaluation and attention to the new mass creation.

The Chinese Communist Party has always attached importance to mass art creation and folk literature work. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized the importance of mass art creation for the development of literature and art in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." After the forum, the work of collecting and sorting out folk art was launched, and results were achieved. This spring, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly called for a large-scale collection of folk songs from all over the country at party meetings. Due to the advocacy of the Party Central Committee and the active promotion of local party committees, a nationwide and all-people movement to collect folk songs was launched vigorously.

What is now on the agenda is how to vigorously promote the correct development of mass art creation, and how to strengthen and improve folk art research work. Therefore, the convening of the National Folk Literature Workers Conference is timely. The conference exchanged experiences in folk literature work from various places and put forward the tasks and guidelines for future work based on the new situation.

China's folk literature work began in the "May Fourth" period, but the influence of various bourgeois literary thoughts hindered the development of the work. Bourgeois literati either despised folk literature in every possible way, or peddled Western folklore, treating folk literature as antique for appreciation, and folk literature work as leisurely, curiosity-seeking "elegant affairs" and personal hobbies. Lu Xun gave a very high evaluation of folk art. He said, "Tolstoy and Flaubert can be produced from ballad books and storytelling," and he forcefully refuted the reactionary views of those bourgeois literary aristocrats who despised folk art. Lu Xun not only widely discussed and applied folk art in his own works, but also made Marxist explanations on many aspects of folk art, from the collection and sorting out work to the evaluation of folk literature and the study of national forms, laying the preliminary foundation for the Marxist theory of Chinese folk literature. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" further pointed out the correct direction for folk literature work. In contrast to this proletarian road of folk literature work, there is another bourgeois road. Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng, wearing the cloak of Marxism, distorted the correct views and attitudes of Marxism towards folk literature, and they attempted to fundamentally obliterate the existence of folk literature. Zhong Jingwen is a representative of the bourgeois folklore school, and his proposition is actually to stifle folk literature work.

The conference criticized the various bourgeois ideas that existed in folk literature work, and also opposed the attitude of treating folk literature work as something that can only be monopolized by a few experts. With the upsurge of mass art creation, folk literature work has broken through the original narrow framework. It is by no means just the research work carried out by a few scholars in colleges and studios. It should not be collected and sorted out coldly and slowly by a small number of experts and literary workers; instead, it should be done by relying on the whole party and the whole people in accordance with the work methods of more, faster, better, and more economical. The conference determined the working policy of comprehensive collection, key sorting out, vigorous promotion, and strengthened research. This is correct.

In terms of collection, we must focus on current new creations. Mass creation is constantly produced and constantly improved, so it needs to be constantly collected. Just like the annual autumn harvest of crops, mass creation also needs to be collected and sorted out every year. In addition to folk songs and ballads, all folk literature and art such as folk tales, storytelling, operas, arts and crafts, paintings, sculptures, music, and dance must also be valued and comprehensively collected, sorted out, and studied. All localities and relevant departments must make plans to carry out this work.

On the one hand, we must focus on collecting current new creations, and on the other hand, we cannot ignore all the excellent folk art works of the past. All ethnic groups and all regions of our country have a wealth of folk art. The excellent works of various stages of the Chinese people's revolution in the past hundred years, especially in the past forty years, are valuable art works and precious revolutionary historical materials, which must be collected as soon as possible. Many traditional works are only preserved in the memories of the elderly, and if they are not collected as soon as possible, they may be lost.

The folk art treasures of various ethnic groups and various eras in our country are a treasure in our national culture. Its value is immeasurable, and it is also extremely precious to the world culture. The current new folk art is an effective weapon for encouraging the masses to carry out socialist construction. It will inevitably have a huge and profound impact on the further massification and nationalization of our country's literature and art. Our literary writers must earnestly learn from them, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the national psychology, national habits, and being infected by the communist thoughts, feelings, and styles of the broad masses of working people, so as to further improve their creations. Only on the basis of rich and profound mass art creation can our socialist literature and art achieve more glorious development.

### 加强民间文艺工作

    加强民间文艺工作
    去冬今春以来的生产大跃进，带来了文化大跃进，一个汹涌澎湃的文化革命运动开始了。大量新民歌的产生，就是这个文化革命运动的重要标志之一。不少县从今年初到现在短短几个月内，产生了几十万首民歌。民间歌手、快板诗人大显身手，党委书记带头创作。群众创作的热潮已在全国各地形成。许多省、县以至乡、社都出版了本地区的民歌选集，不少厂矿也出版了职工业余写作者的文艺刊物。这是中国文化史上空前未有的现象。
    新民歌的蓬勃发展，是特别值得重视的。它是生产大跃进的生动反映，也是群众共产主义精神高涨的反映。劳动群众把自己在生产建设中所得到的灵感，把自己的思想、情感和愿望，熟练而巧妙地运用他们所熟悉所喜爱的形式，发为诗歌，歌颂劳动，歌颂新的人与人的关系、人与自然的关系，歌颂共产主义新事物，歌颂党的领导。新民歌反映了群众的干劲，反过来又鼓舞了群众的干劲，有力地促进了生产建设的发展。它们是政治鼓动的工具，又是最好的诗。
    民歌是劳动人民的集体创作。在旧时代，劳动人民由于阶级的剥削和压迫，被剥夺了学习文化的权利，他们只有用自己的歌唱来表达对于压迫者、剥削者的切齿仇恨和对于美好生活的梦想。千百年来，许多优秀的民间文学作品，至今还在群众中流传，这是我国民族文化传统中的财富。但是，由于时代的限制，这些作品当然不可能像今天的群众创作那样表现出劳动人民当家作主、征服自然、建设新生活的舒畅心情和英雄气概。在今天的群众创作中我们可以看出作者的革命的、共产主义的世界观。这是一种崭新的文学，是以建设社会主义、共产主义为目标的体力劳动与脑力劳动结晶的产物。共产主义文学艺术是建立在体力劳动和智力劳动相结合的基础上的。当前的数以百万和千万计的工农兵所创作的新民歌，应该说就是共产主义文艺的萌芽，它们使我们看到了未来的共产主义文学艺术的繁荣兴旺的无比宽广的道路。旧的民间文学的概念已经不完全适合于今天的群众文艺创作了。我们应该对新的群众创作给以最高的估价和重视。
    中国共产党是历来重视群众文艺创作、重视民间文学工作的。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中一再强调群众文艺创作对于文艺发展的重要意义。座谈会后展开了民间文艺的搜集整理工作，取得了成果。今年春天，毛泽东同志在党的会议上，反复号召大规模地搜集各地民歌。由于党中央的倡导，各地党委的积极推动，一个全国性全民性的搜集民歌运动就声势浩大地展开了。
    目前提到日程上来的，是如何用大力来促进群众文艺创作的正确发展，如何加强和改善民间文艺的研究工作。因此，全国民间文学工作者大会的召开是适时的。会议交流了各地民间文学工作的经验，根据新的形势提出了今后工作的任务和方针。
    我国的民间文学工作从“五四”就开始了，但是各种资产阶级文艺思想的影响，阻碍了工作的发展。资产阶级文人或者对民间文学加以百般鄙视，或者贩卖西方的民俗学，把民间文学当作赏玩的古董，把民间文学工作当作消闲、猎奇的“雅事”和个人的癖好。鲁迅对民间文艺曾给与极高的评价。他说：“从唱本说书里可以产生托尔斯泰、弗罗倍尔”，他有力地批驳了那些轻视民间文艺的资产阶级文学贵族的反动观点。鲁迅不但在自己著作中广泛地论述和应用了民间文艺，而且对民间文艺的许多方面，从搜集整理工作到对于民间文学的估价、民族形式的研究等，作了马克思主义的解释，奠定了中国民间文学的马克思主义理论的初步基础。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”更指出了民间文学工作的正确方向。同这一条民间文学工作的无产阶级的道路相对立的，是另一条资产阶级的道路。胡风、冯雪峰披着马克思主义的外衣，歪曲马克思主义对于民间文学的正确观点和态度，他们企图从根本上抹杀民间文学的存在。钟敬文是资产阶级民俗学派的一个代表，他的主张实际上是要扼杀民间文学工作。
    会议批判了在民间文学工作中所存在的各种资产阶级思想，也反对了那种把民间文学工作当作只能由少数专家来包办的态度。随着群众文艺创作的高涨，民间文学工作已经突破了原来狭隘的框框，它决不仅仅是几个学者在学院和书斋里所从事的研究工作。它不应该冷冷清清地由少数专家、文艺工作者来“少费慢差”地搜集一点，整理一点；而是应该依靠全党全民按照多快好省的工作方法来做。会议确定了全面搜集、重点整理、大力推广、加强研究的工作方针。这是正确的。
    在搜集方面，必须着重当前的新创作。群众创作不断产生，不断提高，也就需要不断搜集。好像庄稼的每年秋收一样，群众创作也需要每年搜集整理。除了民歌民谣以外，民间故事、说唱、戏曲、工艺美术、绘画、雕塑、音乐、舞蹈等所有民间文学艺术，也都必须加以重视，全面地加以搜集整理和研究。各地各有关部门必须做出规划，进行这个工作。
    一方面必须以搜集当前的新创作为重点，一方面不能忽视过去时代的一切优秀的民间文艺作品。全国各地方、各民族都有蕴藏量丰富的民间文艺。近百年来，特别是近四十年来中国人民革命各个阶段的优秀作品，是有价值的文艺作品，也是珍贵的革命史料，必须赶快搜集。许多传统作品只保存在老年人的记忆中，如果不及早搜集，就很可能失传。
    我国各个民族、各个时代的民间文艺宝藏是我国民族文化中的一宗财富，它的价值是无可估量的，它对于世界文化说来，也是极其珍贵的。当前的新的民间文艺，更是鼓舞群众进行社会主义建设的有力的宣传鼓动武器，它对于我国文学艺术的进一步群众化、民族化，必将产生巨大的深刻的影响。我们的文艺作家必须认真地向它们学习，借此更加深刻地了解民族的心理、民族的习惯，感染到广大劳动群众的共产主义思想感情和风格，来进一步提高他们的创作。只有在丰富深厚的群众文艺创作的基础上，我们的社会主义文学艺术才能得到更光辉的发展。
