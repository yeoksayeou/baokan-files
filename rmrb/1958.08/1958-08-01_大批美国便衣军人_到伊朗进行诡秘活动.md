Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 30th: According to reports from Tehran, recently a large number of American soldiers in plainclothes have been continuously arriving in Iran from West Germany under the guise of "tourists." The large influx of American "tourists" began arriving at Mehrabad Airport on July 16th. They are being transported by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and "Air France" flights.

These "tourists" do not bring family members and have very little luggage. After arriving in Tehran, they immediately go to provincial cities near the Iraqi border, such as Haneh, Tisful, and Kermanshah. More than 1,000 of these "tourists" have arrived in Tehran recently.

Sources here believe that the arrival of a large number of American soldiers in Iran is directly related to the extensive plans orchestrated by the United States for aggression in the Middle East.

    大批美国便衣军人
    到伊朗进行诡秘活动
    新华社31日讯  据塔斯社卡拉奇30日讯：据来自德黑兰的消息说，最近大批穿便衣的美国军人不断地从西德以“游客”的身份来到伊朗。大批的美国“游客”从7月16日开始陆续到达麦赫拉巴德机场。运送他们的是荷兰皇家航空公司和“法国航空公司”的班机。
    这些“游客”不带家眷，行李也很少。他们到达德黑兰以后，就马上去哈奈、提斯浮尔和基尔曼沙等邻近伊拉克边境的省城。最近到达德黑兰的这种“游客”共达一千多人。
    此间人士认为，大批美国军人到达伊朗这件事同美国广泛策划的侵略中近东计划有直接关系。
