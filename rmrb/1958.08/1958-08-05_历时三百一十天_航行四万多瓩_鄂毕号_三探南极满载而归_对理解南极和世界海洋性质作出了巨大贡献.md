Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: According to TASS, the Soviet diesel-electric ship "Ob" has completed its third Antarctic expedition and returned fully loaded, arriving in Leningrad on August 2nd. The vast amount of data collected during this voyage has made significant contributions to understanding Antarctica and the nature of the world's oceans.

    During the 310-day voyage, the "Ob" traveled over 44,000 kilowatts. The members of the Soviet Third Antarctic Marine Expedition, led by Professor Kort, conducted aerial photography of a vast area of the East Antarctic coast, covering approximately 42,000 square kilometers. They accurately determined the position of the East Antarctic coastline and discovered new mountains, glaciers, bays, and islands, especially in the Banzare Coast, George V Land, and Oates Land areas, where numerous new geographical discoveries were made. They also more thoroughly explored the physical and geographical conditions of the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica, one of the least studied areas in the world's oceans, clarifying issues related to water exchange and heat exchange between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.

    During this expedition, over 3,800 seawater samples were collected from various depths, from the ocean surface to the ocean floor, along with 927 plankton samples. More than 3,000 fish of various kinds were caught, and a large number of seabed sediment specimens were collected. These collections of marine animals can be used to illustrate their distribution from the Antarctic coast to the subtropical regions.

    Scientists on the "Ob" also launched numerous high-altitude meteorological rockets to study the upper atmosphere. These observations provided valuable data for studying the characteristics of atmospheric circulation in the Antarctic region and its interaction between the two hemispheres. During this voyage, the "Ob" also released a radio-sounding balloon to measure solar energy, conducting continuous measurements of total and reflected solar radiation in the atmosphere, which had never been done before, and obtained excellent results.

    历时三百一十天  航行四万多瓩
    “鄂毕号”三探南极满载而归
    对理解南极和世界海洋性质作出了巨大贡献
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联柴油电动船“鄂毕号”完成了第三次南极考察航行，满载而归，在8月2日回到了列宁格勒。这次航行中收集的大量资料，对理解南极和世界海洋的性质作出了重大的贡献。
    在这次历时三百一十天的航行中，“鄂毕号”共走过了四万四千多瓩。这艘船上以科尔特教授为首的苏联第三南极海上考察队的队员们，对面积约四万两千平方公里的南极东海岸广阔地区进行了空中摄影，相当精确地确定了南极东部海岸线的位置，发现了一些新的山、冰河、海湾、岛屿，特别是在班扎尔岸、乔治五世地和奥特斯岸一带有许多新的地理发现。他们更充分地探明了世界海洋中研究得最少的南极附近太平洋的物理——地理条件，明确了印度洋和太平洋之间、太平洋和大西洋之间的水交换和热交换方面的有关问题。
    在这次考察航行中，收集了从洋面到洋底各种不同深度的海水试样三千八百多份，浮游生物试样九百二十七份，捞获了各种各样的鱼三千多尾，还收集了大量洋底沉淀物标本。用这些海洋动物的收集品就可以说明它们在南极沿岸到亚热带地区的分布情况。
    “鄂毕号”上的科学家们还发射了许多高空气象火箭，对大气高层进行了考察。这些观测提供了有关研究南极地区大气环流特点及其在两半球之间的相互作用的珍贵资料。在这次航行中，“鄂毕号”还放出了一个测量太阳光能用的无线电探测气球，进行了从来无人进行过的对太阳在大气层中总辐射和反射辐射的连续测量，并且获得了很好的结果。
