Xinhua News Agency, 3rd August: The broad masses of people in Beijing warmly support the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, believing that it is a major measure related to the fate of mankind at this critical juncture of the current international situation to further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, alliance, mutual assistance, and joint struggle to safeguard world peace. They warn the aggressors headed by US imperialism: If they dare to impose war on the people of the world, the people of China and the Soviet Union will, together with all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world, completely eliminate the aggressors.

This afternoon, after the people of Beijing heard the full text of the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev from the radio and then saw it in the evening paper, they immediately spread the news to each other. The radio station constantly received inquiries from listeners about the next broadcast time. More than 180,000 copies of the Beijing Evening News were issued, more than doubling the number issued yesterday.

Many workers, suburban farmers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, students, and residents immediately held discussions.

Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant said at a discussion that the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev was a meeting related to the fate of the people of the world and another serious warning to imperialism. Steelworker Wang Cai said that the communiqué of the meeting reflects the demands of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and the close unity and increasing strength of the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union are a powerful guarantee of world peace. Liu Huizhang, head of the blast furnace team, said that the communiqué reflects the determination of the people of China and the Soviet Union to defend peace and oppose aggression. If US and British imperialism dare to go crazy, we will use action to defend peace. Workers at the Beijing Xinhua Printing Plant gathered at the factory gate at 6:00 p.m. to listen to the broadcast. The workers unanimously supported the content of the communiqué, believing that it was a strong warning to US and British imperialism. At 10:30 p.m., more than 5,000 workers from the state-owned Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory, without taking off their work clothes, rushed to the square for a rally. They unanimously expressed their support for the meeting communiqué, and many workers posted hundreds of big-character posters overnight. In various workshops and dormitories, workers also spontaneously held discussions. After work, more than 2,000 day-shift workers at the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant immediately convened discussions separately. The workers denounced the crimes of US and British imperialism in continuing to increase troops in the Middle East and conducting nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific.

Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing also held meetings, pointing out that the communiqué showed the determination and strength of the people of China and the Soviet Union to defend peace, severely cracked down on the imperialist plot to launch a new war, and further encouraged the anti-colonialist struggle of the people in the Middle East and all countries of the world. Tian Hai, a lieutenant colonel who had performed meritorious service in the war, said: We love peace, but if the imperialists dare to provoke a war, we will eliminate it from the earth.

Many students from the Beijing Mining Institute immediately wrote big-character posters and went around reporting the news, beating gongs and drums, after hearing the news from the broadcast. Wherever they went, the crowds that gathered there cheered excitedly. Many teachers and students from Renmin University of China and Peking University held discussions, believing that the communiqué was the greatest support and encouragement for the national liberation movements of the Arabs and other oppressed nations. The "complete unanimity" of the leaders of China and the Soviet Union on international situations and other issues appeared particularly powerful, and the imperialists should contemplate it deeply.

Members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, who had just returned from the fields for a rest, felt greatly encouraged when they heard the news of the meeting between the two chairmen on the radio. Cooperative member Hu Zhongxian said: Our 500 million Chinese farmers have always loved peace, but we are never afraid of war. If imperialism dares to provoke a war, I will respond to the call of the motherland at any time, put down my hoe, pick up my gun, and completely eliminate the aggressors.

Zhao Zhongyao, deputy director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out: The meeting between the two chairmen represents the will of the people of China and the Soviet Union, who account for nearly one-third of the world's population, and the billions of peace-loving people around the world. He expressed his firm support for the communiqué of the meeting and said that he would further heighten his vigilance and be ready to do everything in his power to defend world peace at any time.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd August: The news of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing has inspired the people of Shanghai. On the same evening, the joint extra edition of the Liberation Daily, News Daily, and Wenhui Daily issued 300,000 copies. Many factories broadcast the news in the afternoon, and some even held rallies to express their full support for the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao and Comrade Khrushchev.

At the No. 12 State Cotton Factory, more than 2,000 workers in various workshops held a rally at around 7:00 p.m., holding up slogans and beating gongs and drums. Many residents nearby also came to participate. After the person presiding over the meeting read out the communiqué of the meeting, the venue erupted in prolonged cheers. Advanced worker Li Xiuying said: Chairman Mao and Comrade Khrushchev fully represent the will of us workers. The Shanghai Tram No. 2 Maintenance Factory passed on the communiqué to the trams on each line. After hearing it, the ticket sellers on duty immediately publicized it in the carriages and held discussions in groups after work. Shi Donglin from the No. 22 tram team said that the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao and Comrade Khrushchev fully demonstrated the determination and strength of the governments and people of China and the Soviet Union to resolutely stop the crazy aggression of imperialism.

At around 6:00 p.m., various post offices announced the forecast for the issuance of extra editions tonight, and hundreds of people lined up in front of the doors to wait to buy them. At a newsstand on the Bund of Nanjing Road, 1,200 copies of the extra edition were sold out in ten minutes. On the side of the road, citizen Zhu Congzhi recited the full text of an extra edition he bought to citizens who had not bought one. People believe that the great unity of China and the Soviet Union is the greatest guarantee of peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd August: The people of Tianjin, who have been closely watching the development of the international situation, were extremely excited after seeing the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev. More than 200,000 copies of the extra edition jointly published by the Tianjin newspapers this afternoon were quickly snapped up. Tens of thousands of people listened to this exciting news by the radio. Students from many universities and middle schools, such as Nankai University and No. 2 Middle School, immediately paraded in the rain, shouting "Immediately convene a summit conference of the great powers!" "Resolutely demand that the US and British aggressor troops get out of the Middle East!" Students from No. 2 Middle School held a parade singing the song "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind" to express their support for the communiqué of the meeting.

The workers of Tianjin have expressed that they will use practical actions to support the communiqué of the meeting. The workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant have expressed that they will produce more steel to enhance the country's strength to defend peace. The workers expanding the converter in the steelmaking plant proposed to complete the expansion of a converter in fourteen days, producing more than 10,000 tons of steel for the country. After hearing the news of the meeting between the two chairmen on the radio, the employees of the Tianjin Woolen Mill, who were making blankets for the United Arab Republic, were in high spirits. Kang Weixin, the model group leader of the weaving workshop, said that the communiqué was a serious blow to imperialism. In order to oppose the armed intervention of US and British imperialism against the people of the Middle East, we must better complete this order to support the people of the Middle East.

Guo Yufang, a worker at the Zhicheng Iron Printing and Can Making Factory who witnessed the tragic situation of the people of Hiroshima suffering from the atomic bomb attack in Hiroshima, Japan, said that the opinions put forward by the leaders of China and the Soviet Union on maintaining world peace regarding the cessation of testing and the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons represent the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. As a witness to the atomic weapons disaster, I firmly support this call by the leaders of China and the Soviet Union.

At the Tianjin National Defense Education Exhibition, which opened today, the officers and soldiers who had just finished a day of intense explanation work held a discussion in the evening. Wang Shuxun, a military aircraft repairman who joined the army in 1938, described the fact that he used to repair old-fashioned rifles from the Gengzi Year and manufacture "Red Tasselled Spears," but now he participates in repairing domestically produced cannons of huge caliber. He said that this fully demonstrates the strength of the Chinese People's Armed Forces. If imperialism dares to provoke a war, the peace-loving forces all over the world will completely eliminate them. (Attached photo)
