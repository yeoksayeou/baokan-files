Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 7th. Albanian newspapers published editorials on the 7th, supporting the Soviet Union's new proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The "People's Voice" published an editorial entitled "New Initiatives to Stop Aggression," pointing out that the Soviet proposal is a new measure to defend and consolidate world peace and find ways to eliminate the danger of war. It once again expressed the public opinion of the world demanding the easing of tensions.

The editorial pointed out that the United Nations should express the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, and should find ways to extinguish the flames of war in the Near and Middle East so that the region can be calm and peaceful.

The "Unity Newspaper" editorial stated that Khrushchev's initiative once again expressed the Soviet Union's firm will to resolve the serious danger in the Near and Middle East through negotiations. In order to achieve this lofty goal, aggression should first be stopped and U.S. and British troops should immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th. Today's Jakarta "People's Daily" condemned U.S. President Eisenhower's suggestion that the UN special meeting should discuss "indirect aggression," saying that this suggestion shows how stubbornly the United States, which pursues an aggressive foreign policy, remains unrepentant.

The newspaper said that we should spare no effort to demand the implementation of the Soviet proposal, that is, to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops, which is the fundamental issue in the current international situation, especially in the Middle East situation.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. TASS, Kabul, 7th: "Reform Newspaper" published an editorial commenting on Khrushchev's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union's new initiative is of great significance and a valuable contribution to the cause of consolidating peace. The editorial hopes that the General Assembly will find the right way to eliminate the threat of war in the Arab East and play an important role in the cause of consolidating world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th. Hungarian newspapers, commenting on the letter from Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the heads of Western governments, emphasized that the Soviet proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly is sincerely committed to a rapid and peaceful resolution of the current situation, and this proposal does not exclude the idea of convening a high-level meeting. "People's Freedom Daily" reported on the 7th: The purpose of the Soviet proposal remains: to take action to ease international tensions faster and more appropriately. The Soviet Union's new proposal can end the stalemate and delay of talks, and it may mean a step forward on the road to establishing peace and tranquility. Now it is up to the Western countries. They should also take a step forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 7th. The Mongolian "Truth Newspaper" today published the news of Khrushchev's letter to the heads of the US, British and French governments on the front page with large headlines, and commented that the Mongolian public supports Khrushchev's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations to discuss the West Asian issue.

The commentary wrote that the US-British imperialist bloc has launched armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and stubbornly maintains an extremely tense situation in the Near and Middle East. The US-British imperialist bloc continues to put forward absurd and unfounded lies in order to justify their shameful interference in Arab countries. However, paper cannot contain fire, and no trick to cover up the crimes committed can help them escape the punishment of the people.

The commentary pointed out that ending the aggression against the Arab East is an urgent need for all peace-loving and freedom-loving people. Every honest person should fully support Khrushchev's proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. "Labor News" published a commentary today, welcoming Khrushchev's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US and British invading forces from Lebanon and Jordan. The commentary said that Khrushchev's proposal is a beneficial way to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue.

The commentary said that we believe that all member states of the United Nations should smash the conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc to manipulate the voting machine in the United Nations, resolutely condemn their aggressive acts against the Near and Middle East, and demand that the invading forces immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. This is a major and unavoidable obligation that all member states must bear at present. The editorial pointed out that, just as the US invading forces refused to withdraw from Korea, making the Korean issue unable to be resolved peacefully, if the US and British invading forces do not withdraw from the Near and Middle East, the tense situation in this region cannot be eased.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th. The Cairo "Evening News" criticized in an editorial today that while accepting Khrushchev's proposal to convene a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States actually demanded that issues other than the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Middle East be discussed. The editorial pointed out that this is a conspiracy to sabotage peace.

The newspaper said: "We want the withdrawal of foreign troops, not just talk about the issue of withdrawal."

The newspaper also said that it is inconceivable for the United Nations to re-discuss Lebanon's "accusations" and so-called "indirect aggression," because the United States has disregarded the United Nations' report and sent occupying forces to land in Lebanon, thereby threatening world peace and security, which has violated the dignity of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 7th. "Light Newspaper" reported today that political figures in Damascus welcomed and supported Khrushchev's proposal to hold an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the immediate withdrawal of US and British invading forces from Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper said that these people believe that this proposal will help ease international tensions and prevent the war that imperialism is trying to launch.

"Victory Newspaper" today quoted political figures here as saying that this proposal is a very timely action that blocks the path for imperialism to carry out its conspiracies. The newspaper also said that this proposal prevents the US conspiracy to obstruct any decision in the Security Council regarding the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper said that although holding an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East may also be obstructed by the United States and Britain, this meeting can become a place to expose imperialist conspiracies in front of the world.

    美英军队不撤退  中东局势不缓和
    各国舆论认为联大会议不应讨论美英撤军以外的问题
    据新华社地拉那7日电  阿尔巴尼亚报纸7日发表社论，支持苏联提出的召开联合国大会紧急会议的新建议。
    “人民之声报”以“制止侵略的新倡议”为题发表社论，指出苏联的建议是保卫和巩固世界和平和寻找消灭战争危险道路的新措施。它又一次地表达了全世界要求缓和紧张局势的公众舆论。
    社论指出，联合国应当表达全世界人民的和平愿望，应当寻找扑灭中近东战火的方法，使这一区域能够平静安宁。
    “团结报”的社论说，赫鲁晓夫的倡议再一次表达了苏联以谈判来解决中近东严重危险的坚定意志。为了达到这一崇高的目的，首先应该制止侵略和使美英军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出。
    据雅加达8日电  今天的雅加达“人民日报”谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔关于联合国特别会议应该讨论“间接侵略”的建议说，这个建议表明，奉行侵略外交政策的美国是多么顽固不化。
    报纸说，我们应该不遗余力地要求实现苏联的建议，那就是，召开联合国大会特别会议来讨论美英军队撤退的问题，这个问题是当前国际局势，特别是中东局势中的基本问题。
    新华社8日讯  塔斯社喀布尔7日讯：“革新报”发表社论，评论赫鲁晓夫提出的关于召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的建议。
    报纸指出，苏联的新倡议有巨大的意义，它是对巩固和平事业的宝贵贡献。社论希望大会找出正确的途径来消除阿拉伯东方爆发战争的威胁，并且在巩固世界和平的事业中起重要的作用。
    新华社布达佩斯7日电  匈牙利报纸在评论苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给西方国家政府首脑的信时强调指出，苏联提出召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议，是真诚地在致力于迅速和平解决现在的局势，这个建议绝不排斥召开高级会议的主张。“人民自由报”7日报道：苏联建议的目的仍然是：更快更合适地采取缓和国际紧张局势的行动。苏联的新建议可以结束踏步不前和拖延会谈的局面，它可能意味着在建立和平和安宁的道路上前进一步。现在要看西方国家的了。它们也应该前进一步。
    新华社乌兰巴托7日电  蒙古“真理报”今天以大字标题在第一版刊登了赫鲁晓夫写信给美、英、法三国政府首脑的消息，并且发表评论说，蒙古公众支持赫鲁晓夫就讨论西亚问题召开联合国紧急会议的建议。
    评论写道，美英帝国主义集团武装侵略了黎巴嫩和约旦，并且顽固地保持中近东地区的极端紧张局势。美英帝国主义集团为了辩解他们对阿拉伯国家的可耻干涉，继续提出荒谬的、毫无根据的谎言。但是，纸是包不住火的，任何企图掩盖犯下的罪行的诡计都不能帮助他们逃脱人民的惩罚。
    评论指出，结束对阿拉伯东方的侵略，是一切爱好和平和爱好自由的人民的迫切需要。每一个诚实的人都应全力支持赫鲁晓夫的建议。
    据新华社平壤8日电  “劳动新闻”今天发表评论，欢迎赫鲁晓夫关于召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的建议。评论说，赫鲁晓夫的建议是和平解决中近东问题的有益的途径。
    评论说，我们认为联合国所有成员国应该粉碎美国侵略集团在联合国操纵表决机器的阴谋，坚决斥责它们对中近东的侵略行为，要求侵略军立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，这是目前所有成员国必须承担的不可规避的重大义务。社论指出，同美国侵略军不肯撤出朝鲜从而使朝鲜问题不能得到和平解决一样，美英侵略军不撤出中近东，这一地区的紧张局势就不能缓和下来。
    新华社开罗7日电  开罗“晚报”今天在社论中指责说，美国在接受赫鲁晓夫关于召开联合国大会特别紧急会议的建议的同时，竟要求讨论除了美英军队撤出中东以外的问题。社论指出，这是企图破坏和平的阴谋。
    这家报纸说：“我们是要外国军队撤退，而不是光谈论关于撤退的问题”。
    这家报纸还说，要联合国再度讨论黎巴嫩的“控诉”和所谓“间接侵略”是不可想像的，因为美国漠视联合国的报告，派遣占领军在黎巴嫩登陆从而威胁世界和平和安全，已经触犯了联合国的尊严。
    新华社大马士革7日电  “光明报”今天报道，大马士革的政界人士欢迎和支持赫鲁晓夫提出的要求举行联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英侵略军立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退的问题的建议。这家报纸说，这些人士认为这个建议有助于缓和国际紧张局势和防止帝国主义正在力图发动的战争。
    “胜利报”今天援引了这里政界人士的话说，这个建议是非常及时的行动，它堵住了帝国主义施展阴谋的道路。这家报纸又说，这个建议阻止了美国企图在安全理事会阻挠作出有关从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退美英军队的任何决定的阴谋。这家报纸说，举行联合国大会紧急会议来讨论从中东撤退外国军队的问题，虽然也可能遭到美英的阻挠，但是这个会议可以成为在全世界面前来揭露帝国主义阴谋的场所。
