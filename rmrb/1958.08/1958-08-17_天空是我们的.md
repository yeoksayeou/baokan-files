    On the southeastern coastal defense front of our motherland, in the past half month, our powerful People's Air Force has repeatedly reported victories. In four air battles, nine American-made Chiang planes were shot down or damaged, effectively打击 [dǎ jī: attacked] the Chiang army's planes from intruding into the mainland and defending the sacred airspace.

    The outstanding air battle on August 14th dealt an even more severe blow to the air force of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, which is equipped and trained by American imperialism.

    On this day, before dawn, the pilots of an air force unit of the Fujian Front got up and came to the parking line to start a day of combat life.

    At more than ten o'clock in the morning, our air intelligence soldiers discovered American-made Chiang planes coming to intrude—twelve F-86 jet fighters—and immediately reported to the command. Zhao Junshan and his comrades were performing first-class duty tasks.

    "Air raid!" The tower issued a signal to enter first-class combat readiness. The airport was suddenly overwhelmed by the roar of engines. The silver war eagles spewed out blazing streams of air, quickly left the parking line, slid towards the flat runway, and rushed into the sky.

    At more than ten thirty, our plane number eight first discovered the Chiang planes. At this time, our formation was flying northeast along the southwest coastline, and the Chiang planes were flying southwest on the right side of our formation, from the northeast. Taking advantage of the cover of the sun, the Chiang planes continued to intrude into the airspace over our mainland from an altitude of 11,000 meters. Our aerial warriors were burning with anger. When they received the order from the air commander, "You attack, we cover," Zhao Junshan immediately led his comrades to turn right, ready to attack. At this moment, the Chiang planes, frightened out of their wits, also hurriedly turned right, trying to get rid of the attack. In this way, our formation and the Chiang planes had a "head-on confrontation." Our planes rushed past the enemy planes from below. The Chiang planes were frightened by this thrilling scene, and the formation was immediately in chaos. When our plane pulled up its nose and turned around to intercept the enemy plane's nose, the Chiang plane's wingman squadron immediately divided into two groups, left and right, in no particular order, and fled in a panic.

    At this time, enemy and our aircraft were engaged in fierce fighting at an altitude of more than 10,000 meters, at maximum speed. At this critical moment, our plane number eight discovered that two Chiang planes were trying to attack his leader from the side and rear. In order to protect the safety of the leader, he rushed over without hesitation, and used the sight to lock onto the would-be perpetrators. When he entered the ideal attack position, he fired fiercely, knocking an enemy plane upside down. The enemy plane dragged a red tail of smoke, fled erratically, and fell into the sea west of Taiwan.

    The enemy's planes became even more cunning. Seven enemy planes pulled smoke at an altitude of 11,500 meters to confuse our planes, and four other Chiang planes ambushed at an altitude above 12,000 meters. When our planes were just about to launch an attack, these four Chiang planes took advantage of the situation and attempted to launch a sneak attack. However, they did not know that our plane number eight, after shooting down a Chiang plane, had just pulled up its nose and first discovered these four sneaky Chiang planes following behind our plane. This brave war eagle, disregarding its own safety, threw itself into battle again, rushed straight towards the enemy plane like a swallow in the mist, and immediately opened fire, wounding a Chiang plane. Then, he turned around with lightning speed, locked on to a Chiang plane. He saw a fire dragon spewing from the war eagle's head, and a string of shells hit the Chiang plane. With a loud explosion, the Chiang plane crashed immediately. A Chiang army pilot wearing a yellow parachute plunged into the sea. The other enemy planes, seeing that the situation was not good, also fled to Taiwan.

    This is the fourth heavy blow that our brave war eagles have inflicted on the Chiang army's planes since July 29. On July 29, Zhao De'an, a pilot of our air force unit, and his comrades, with a force of one-on-one, created the glorious victory of shooting down or wounding three F84-type American-made Chiang planes. In the two air battles on August 7 and 13, the heroes of our air force unit once again wounded three American-made Chiang planes in one fell swoop. The heroes said proudly: We are the "overlords" of the motherland's sky, the sky is ours! (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国东南海防前线，近半个月来，我强大的人民空军捷报频传，四次空战，击落击伤美制蒋机九架，有力地打击了蒋军飞机对大陆的窜扰，保卫了神圣的领空。
    8月14日进行的一场出色的空战，更给予美帝国主义装备和训练的蒋介石集团的空军以严重打击。
    这一天，天还没亮，福建前线空军某部的飞行员们就起床了，他们来到停机线，开始了一天的战斗生活。
    上午十点多钟，我对空情报兵发现了前来窜扰的美制蒋机——十二架F—86型喷气战斗机，当时就向指挥作了报告。赵俊山和他的战友们正在执行着一等值班任务。
    “空袭！”塔台上发出了进入一等战备的信号。机场上顿时被轰鸣的马达声所淹没，银色的战鹰喷射着炽烈的气流，迅速地离开停机线，滑向坦平的跑道，冲上天空。
    十点三十多分，我八号机首先发现蒋机。这时候，我机群从西南沿海岸线向东北飞行，蒋机在我机群右侧从东北向西南飞行。蒋机借着阳光的掩护，从一万一千公尺的高度，继续向我大陆上空进扰。我们的空中勇士们心中怒火燃烧。当他们接到空中指挥员“你们攻击，我们掩护”的命令时，赵俊山马上带领他的战友们右转弯，准备攻击。就在这时候，吓破了胆的蒋机也急忙向右转弯，企图摆脱对他们的打击。这样，我机群和蒋机便来了“大对头”，我机从敌机下面猛穿了过去，蒋机被这个惊险的场面吓昏了，队形马上混作一团。当我机拉起机头反转过来，将要截住敌机机头的一刹那，蒋机的僚机中队顿时不分东西南北分成两股，一右一左，胡乱逃命。
    这时候，敌我飞机在一万多公尺的高空中，以最大的速度，展开了激战。在这紧要关头，我八号机发现有两架蒋机企图从侧后攻击他的长机。他为了掩护长机的安全，便不顾一切地加大油门，直冲过去，用瞄准具套住了企图行凶的家伙。当他进入理想的攻击位置时，就狠狠地开炮射击，把一架敌机打个倒栽葱，敌机拖着红色的烟尾巴，一歪一摆地逃去，掉到了台湾以西的大海里。
    敌人的飞机更狡猾起来了。七架敌机在一万一千五百公尺高空拉烟迷惑我机，另外四架蒋机埋伏在一万二千公尺以上的高空中。当我们的飞机刚刚进入攻击时，这四架蒋机乘虚而入，企图偷袭。但是，他们那里晓得我八号机在击落一架蒋机之后，刚刚拉起机头，首先发现了这四架鬼鬼祟祟的蒋机跟在我机后面。这只勇敢的战鹰奋不顾身地再次投入战斗，像雾中的燕子一样，向敌机直冲过去，并立即开炮击伤了一架蒋机；接着，他又神速地掉过头来，套住了一架蒋机，只见战鹰头上吐出一条火龙，成串的炮弹击中蒋机，一声轰然爆炸，这架蒋机当即坠落。一个架着黄色降落伞的蒋军飞行员栽入海中。其他的几架敌机一看情势不妙，也纷纷各自向台湾逃命。
    这是从7月29日以来，我神勇战鹰给予蒋军飞机的第四次沉重打击。7月29日，我空军某部飞行员赵德安和他的战友们，曾以一对一的兵力创造了击落击伤F84型美制蒋机三架的光辉胜利。8月7日和13日两次空战中，我空军某部的英雄们又一举击伤了美制蒋机三架。英雄们自豪地说：我们是祖国天空的“霸王”，天空是我们的！　（新华社）
