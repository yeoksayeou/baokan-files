    This newspaper reports On August 14th, the Hongshunli Production Service Cooperative in Tianjin was established. This cooperative was organized by residents of the Xiangyangli residential area, where Hongshunli is located. It currently has 252 members, 188 of whom are engaged in processing work for the nearby Hengda Electric Wire Factory and Taishan Electric Appliance Factory. The remaining members are also participating in various welfare services for production.

    Hongshunli was originally a residents' group under the Xiangyangli Residents' Committee of Tianwei Road Street in Hebei District. Since the residents of Hongshunli began participating in production and organizing collective life on June 14th, many residents in the Xiangyangli residential area have organized themselves like Hongshunli. Thus, the original nature and form of the Residents' Committee organization could no longer fully adapt to the needs of the new situation, and a new organizational structure had to be established to manage the production and life of the residents. Therefore, under the leadership of the municipal, district, and street Party and government departments, the residents of the Xiangyangli residential area decided to establish a production service cooperative.

    How did the residents of Hongshunli organize a large family to serve production and live a collective life?

    Hongshunli has a total of 176 residents. Apart from employed workers and the elderly living alone, there are more than 20 housewives and residents with labor power. In the past, these people only stayed at home to take care of children and cook. When the general line of socialist construction was transmitted here, the whole alley boiled over, and everyone expressed their willingness to contribute to the realization of the general line. At this time, the nearby Hengda Electric Wire Factory needed a group of people to wind copper wire. Upon hearing this news, the residents were very excited, and within a few days, 17 women signed up to participate in the processing production group to wind copper wire for the electric wire factory.

    The establishment of a processing production group in the street solved the difficulty of insufficient social labor, but it also brought a series of new problems. For example, after women participate in production, what about the children? What about cooking? What about sewing and washing clothes? And so on. Therefore, people began to consider establishing collective canteens, nurseries, disassembly, washing, and sewing organizations. In order to mobilize everyone to participate in these organizations, resident representatives and street activists, after research, launched a debate among the residents: Is it better to support production and live in a socialist big family? Or is it better to only care about oneself and not participate in national construction? During the debate, by presenting facts and reasoning, everyone saw both the national interest and their personal prospects, and their socialist awareness was quickly raised. In this way, a new type of big family was organized, establishing a production processing group, collective canteen, nursery group, disassembly, washing, and sewing station, library station, savings service station, and daily necessities supply service station. This ensured that everyone had something to do, everything was taken care of, and a new style of "I serve everyone, and everyone serves me" was established.

    People living in the big family have changed the entire social landscape and also changed everyone's thinking. Every morning, the residents send their children to the nursery group or kindergarten class to listen to the aunts tell stories and play collective games. At eight o'clock, processing workers, salespersons, cooks, service personnel, etc., all start working. Everyone is working for the collective. At noon, adults and children go to the collective canteen to eat. The food in the canteen is also very suitable for the residents' tastes, and the price is cheap. After the savings service station was established, every household participated in savings, and now family savings have increased to more than 1,000 yuan. Nine women who were originally illiterate participated in cultural studies.

    In collective life, the relationship between people has also changed. For example, Zong Bingzhen and Liu Yuzhen, who lived in the same courtyard, had not spoken for nine years because their children had fought. Now they have shaken hands and made peace, and they help each other in the processing group to learn technology.

    Because the people participating in the processing group help each other learn technology, their work efficiency has now increased from more than 20 kilograms of processing per day at the beginning to 200 kilograms. They can increase production and save 20,000 yuan for the country every year, and each household can increase its income by nearly 300 yuan per year on average.

    Now, on the basis of this Hongshunli residents' big family, a production service cooperative is being expanded and organized. At present, in addition to organizing and leading the production, learning, and life of its members, it will also undertake some of the tasks originally undertaken by the Residents' Committee.

    The practice of Hongshunli is now being widely promoted in Tianjin. (Attached picture)

    人人参加社会劳动　家家都过集体生活
　　鸿顺里居民生活大革命
　　成立生产服务合作社，树立了我为人人、人人为我的新风格
    本报讯　8月14日，天津市鸿顺里生产服务合作社诞生了。这个合作社是由鸿顺里所在居民区——向阳里居民区的居民组织起来的，现共有二百五十二名社员，其中有一百八十八个社员为附近恒大电线厂和泰山电器厂做加工，其余的社员也都参加了为生产服务的各项福利事业。
    鸿顺里原是河北区天纬路街向阳里居民委员会的一个居民小组，鸿顺里的居民从6月14日参加生产，组织起集体生活以后，向阳里居民区的许多居民也像鸿顺里一样组织了起来。这样，原有的居民委员会组织性质和组织形式已不能完全适应新的形势的需要，必须成立新的组织机构来管理居民的生产和生活。于是，向阳里居民区居民在市、区、街党政部门的领导下，决定成立生产服务合作社。
    鸿顺里的居民是怎样组织起大家庭为生产服务、过集体生活的呢？
    鸿顺里共有居民一百七十六人，除去在职的职工和孤老户外，有劳动力的家庭妇女和居民有二十多人。这些人过去只在家里看孩子、做饭。当社会主义建设总路线传到这里的时候，整个胡同都沸腾起来，人人都表示要为实现总路线出把力。这时，正好附近的恒大电线厂需要一批人给缠铜丝。听到这个消息，居民们非常兴奋，几天内就有十七个妇女报名参加了加工生产小组，给电线厂缠铜丝。
    街道里成立了加工生产小组，解决了社会劳动力不足的困难，但同时也带来了一系列新的问题。例如，妇女参加生产以后，孩子怎么办？做饭怎么办？缝洗衣服怎么办？等等。于是，人们又开始酝酿成立集体食堂、托儿所、拆洗缝纫等组织。为了动员大家参加这些组织，居民代表和街道积极分子经过研究，在居民中开展了一场辩论：是支援生产、过社会主义大家庭的生活好？还是只顾个人、不参加国家建设好？在辩论时通过摆事实、讲道理，使大家既看到国家利益，又看到个人前途，很快地提高了社会主义觉悟。就这样，一个新型的大家庭组织起来了，成立了生产加工组、集体食堂、托儿组、拆洗缝纫站、图书站、储蓄服务站、生活日用品供应服务站。做到了人人有事干，事事有人管，树立了“我为人人、人人为我”的新风格。
    人们生活在大家庭里，改变了整个社会面貌，也改变了每个人的思想。居民们每天一清早就把孩子都送到托儿组或幼儿班去，听阿姨们讲故事，做集体游戏。八点钟，加工工人、售货员、炊事员、服务员等都开始工作了，人人都在为集体劳动着，到了中午，大人孩子就到集体食堂去吃饭。食堂里的饭菜也很适合居民的口味，而且价钱便宜。储蓄服务站成立以后，户户都参加了储蓄，现在家庭存款已经增加到一千多元。原来是文盲的九名妇女参加了文化学习。
    在集体生活中，人与人的关系也改变了。如住在一个院子里的宗炳珍和刘玉珍，过去因为孩子打架已经有九年不说话，现在已经握手言好，并在加工组里互相帮助，学习技术。
    由于参加加工组的人都互相帮助学习技术，现在她们的工作效率已经从开始每天加工二十多公斤提高到二百公斤。一年可以为国家增产节约两万元，每户每年平均可以增加收入近三百元。
    现在就在这个鸿顺里居民大家庭的基础上，扩大组织起生产服务合作社。在目前，它除了组织领导社员生产、学习和生活以外，还将担负起一部分原来由居民委员会担负的任务。
    鸿顺里的作法现在已在天津市普遍推广。（附图片）
