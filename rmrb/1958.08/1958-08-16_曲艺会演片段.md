　　Ballad Performance Excerpts
　　Mao Dun
    1. Ballad arts bloom in red profusion, the East wind absolutely prevails over the West wind! The Wu song of midnight turns into a new melody, thoroughly cleansed of affectation, its momentum magnificent.
    2. Sorrow and joy in dreams of Hong Yue'e, how could she take the path of evil because of love and desire? A daughter's thoughts, a hero's courage, though the shackles of feudal ethics are strict, what can they do against her!
    3. Gently striking the clappers, lightly wagging the tongue, both generous and cunning: the superb skill of Kuai Shu [rapid storytelling] by Gao Yuanjun, refreshing to the heart and lungs like ice and snow!
    4. Directly turning the storytelling venue into a battlefield, the sanxian [three-stringed plucked instrument] contends like a heavy machine gun; the victory at Yichuan spreads a new tune, General of Strings and Winds, Han Qixiang!

　　[Note 1] At the ballad performance at Huairen Hall on August 11th, a program of Suzhou Pingtan [storytelling and ballad singing in Suzhou dialect] was entitled "The East Wind Absolutely Prevails Over the West Wind."
　　[Note 2] "Hong Yue'e's Dream" is a Northeast Errenzhuan [two-person comic skit], but this segment is actually a "one-person turn," singing and performing at the same time, similar to the Kunqu operas "Picking up the Painting" and "Calling the Painting."
　　[Note 3] Han Qixiang once said: "The sanxian is my machine gun, storytelling is my bullet, and writing new stories is my arsenal." His words are very heroic. "The Great Victory at Yichuan" was written by Han Qixiang and performed at Huairen Hall on August 11th.

　　曲艺会演片段
　　茅盾
    一曲艺之花朵朵红，东风绝对压西风！吴歌子夜翻新调，净洗铅华气势雄。
    二梦里悲欢红月娥，岂缘爱欲走邪魔？女儿心事英雄胆，礼教虽严奈若何！
    三轻敲绰板轻摇舌，既慷慨兮复诡谲：绝技快书高元钧，沁人心脾如冰雪！
　  四直把书场作战场，三弦争似重机枪；宜川胜利传新曲，弦索将军韩起祥！
　　〔注一〕八月十一日怀仁堂曲艺会演，苏州评弹的一个节目，就名为“东风绝对压西风”。
　　〔注二〕“红月娥做梦”，东北之二人转也，然此段实为“一 人转”，边唱边演，类似昆曲的“拾画”、“叫画”。
　　〔注三〕韩起祥曾说：“三弦就是我的机关枪，说书就是我的子弹，编写新书就是我的兵工厂。”其语甚壮。“宜川大胜利”是韩起祥编撰的，八月十一日在怀仁堂演唱。
