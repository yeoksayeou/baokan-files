　　On "Elbowing Outward"
　　Lin Yi
　　Some time ago, it was reported that the majority of voters in a constituency in Xiao County nominated female model feeder Jin Mingxia as a candidate for people's representative, but a minority disagreed, saying that she reported the team's concealment of production and private distribution to the large commune last year, which was "elbowing outward." This incident sparked a debate. In the end, everyone unanimously agreed that what she did last year was correct, and it was precisely her advantage, so she was still nominated as a candidate for representative. After reading this news, I felt a lot.
　　"Elbowing inward" is a narrow view passed down for thousands of years that only cares about one's own hometown, land, family, and surname. Under the control of this view, within a family, family members must first consider the interests of their own family; in a township, the people of the township must first consider the interests of their own township; in an agency or organization, people must first consider the interests of their own unit. Otherwise, going beyond one's own family, township, or unit, and first or simultaneously considering the interests of other families, townships, or units, would be "elbowing outward" and would be opposed by the people of one's own unit. In the past, people regarded "elbowing inward" as a virtue, which has deep social roots.
　　In a social system of people exploiting people, the various classes are in a state of opposition. The various units composed of people are bound to reflect this state of opposition. Even among the working people, to a certain extent, they are also affected by this state of opposition. "The poor all over the world are one family," is not something that every exploited person is very clear about from the beginning.
　　Now, we have basically completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the cornerstone of "elbowing inward" has been overturned, and the relationship between people has also fundamentally changed. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "Many enterprises, agencies, schools, troops, and individuals have taken the initiative to cooperate with other units and individuals to promote the common development of their own work and the work of others." In Lenin's words, this is "the practical beginning of communism" and "the beginning of a transformation of world historical significance." But a few people have not figured out this principle, and have not realized that the collective is the source of happiness, and bending their arms towards the collective is precisely to connect themselves with that inexhaustible source, so as not to become "carp stranded in a dry rut."
　　In the cause of socialist construction, the part of the work that each person and each unit undertakes is only one link in a chain of ten thousand feet. If anyone abandons the collective and only clings to the piece of land in front of their chest, making a fuss about independence and talking about elbowing inward, what result can there be other than harming the collective and harming themselves?
　　The debate caused by Jin Mingxia's election as a people's representative is worthy of deep thought. There are thousands upon thousands of people like Jin Mingxia who "elbow outward" in our country. The reason why our 600 million people have strength, in addition to many other factors, isn't it because we have 1.2 billion arms tightly linked together?

### 论“胳臂向外弯”

　　论“胳臂向外弯”
　　林伊
    前些时候报载，萧县有个选区的大多数选民提女模范饲养员靳明霞为人民代表候选人，有少数人不同意，说她去年向大社反映队里瞒产私分，是“胳臂向外弯”。这件事引起了一场辩论。最后大家一致认为，她去年那样做是正确的，正是她的优点，结果仍被提为代表候选人。读罢这条消息，感触很多。
    “胳臂向里弯”，这是几千年来相传的只顾本乡本土、本家本姓的狭隘观点。在这种观点支配下，在一家里面，家人要首先考虑本家的利益；在一乡里面，乡人要首先考虑本乡的利益；在一个机关团体里面，人们要首先考虑本单位的利益。否则，越过本家、本乡或本单位，首先或同时考虑别家、别乡或别的单位的利益，那就是“胳臂向外弯”，就要遭到本单位的人们的反对。在过去，人们把“胳臂向里弯”作为一种美德，这是有其深远的社会根源的。
    在人剥削人的社会制度下面，各阶级是处在对立状态的。由人构成的各个单位也必然要反映这种对立状态。就是劳动人民之间，在一定程度上也要受这种对立状态的影响。“天下穷人是一家”，并不是每一个被剥削者一开始就十分清楚的。
    现在，我们已经基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，“胳臂向里弯”的基石已被掀翻了，人与人的关系也随之从根本上改变了。正如刘少奇同志在党的八大二次会议的报告中所说的：“很多企业、机关、学校、部队和个人都主动地同别的单位和个人进行协作，以促进自己的工作和别人的工作共同发展。”用列宁的话说，这是“共产主义的实际开端”，是“有世界历史意义的转变的开端”。但有少数人却没有想通这个道理，没有认识到集体是幸福的源泉，把胳臂弯向集体，这正是为了使自己跟那个永不枯竭的源泉联系起来，好使自己不变成“涸辙之鲋”。
    在社会主义建设的事业中，每个人每个单位所担当的那一部分工作，只不过是万丈锁链中的一环而已。如果有谁撇开集体，只抱着自己胸口的那一块地方，闹什么独立性，谈什么胳臂向里弯，那除掉损害集体并损害自己之外，还能有什么结果呢？
    靳明霞当选人民代表所引起的一场争辩是值得人们深思的。像靳明霞这样“胳臂向外弯”的人在我们国家里是千千万万的。我们六亿人民所以有力量，除掉其他的许多因素之外，不就是因为我们有十二亿只胳臂紧紧地挽在一起吗？
