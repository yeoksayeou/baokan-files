    We Should View Increased Production Experience with a Developmental Perspective
    Cheng Pu
    After the national bumper wheat harvest, a bumper early rice harvest followed closely. Whether we look at the small-scale or the large-scale high-yield experiences of wheat or early rice, an important technical measure stands out: highly dense planting. It can be said that almost no high-yield record of several thousand catties per mu is unrelated to dense planting. Dense planting is not a new experience; it has been practiced for a long time. However, in the era of the small-scale peasant economy, it could not be universally applied. After agricultural cooperativization, dense planting was promoted as an important experience for increasing production. A few years ago, the most popular dense planting method was "small-seedling dense planting" (also called "small-plant dense planting" in some places), which people believed was the most appropriate method. However, the dense planting methods adopted in many places this year are not ordinary dense planting, but highly dense planting, with densities increased by one or two times, or even several times, compared to the past. As a result, people's past concepts about dense planting experience have been broken. This new change has liberated the minds of many people, further recognizing the enormous potential for increased land production and strengthening their confidence in achieving a great leap forward in production. But this new change has also left some people confused and uneasy: How is it that things that were promoted in the past are now being negated?
    In fact, this is not a strange thing. Any production experience is the product of people's production practice under certain production conditions. Production conditions are constantly changing due to subjective or objective factors, and people's knowledge of the laws of production is constantly enriched with the development of practice. Therefore, in the process of production practice, not only will new production experiences be gained, but also some production experiences will be negated (because the original experience does not conform to the objective laws of production, or because the experience cannot adapt to the changed production conditions), and some production experiences will be further developed and enriched. The breakthrough of the old density standards and specifications of dense planting belongs to the latter situation.
    Some people may say: Isn't the "appropriate dense planting" method promoted in the past few years proven to increase production? Yes, this method did promote production, and its promotion in the past was successful. However, the past dense planting only increased the density compared to the backward sparse planting adopted by individual farmers in the past (its progressiveness also lies here). However, a large number of facts today have proven that adopting a denser planting method can increase production even more. The essence of dense planting is to fully utilize sunlight and soil fertility, and to maximize the number of crop plants and ears per unit area (and to require that each ear has many and full grains), thereby obtaining a higher harvest. Dense planting is also closely related to irrigation, fertilizers, and other conditions. Before the advent of the high tide of agricultural production, due to poor water conservancy, fertilizer, and other conditions, the appropriate dense planting that people considered was actually not dense enough. Today, the conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil have been greatly improved. Under such circumstances, replacing the past less dense planting methods with denser planting methods can increase production even more.
    So, is there a limit to the density of dense planting? Land area is limited, and the density of crops per unit area cannot be infinite. However, the fact is that the density of crops in general farmland is still insufficient. So, to what extent is it considered dense enough to reach the limit? It is probably difficult to draw a conclusion easily now. At present, Guangdong, Fujian, and many other regions are vigorously promoting highly dense planting. There are many types of density standards and specifications adopted in various places (such as large-seedling dense planting, medium-seedling dense planting, small-seedling dense planting, single-seedling dense planting, triangular cluster planting, ridge planting, complex dense planting...), some are similar, some are quite different. It can be said that a hundred flowers are blooming and competing for beauty. Perhaps some dense planting practices are not entirely reasonable, but this does not matter. Through continuous practice, through people's continuous exploration of the potential of land for increased production, and through people's continuous comparison of various dense planting methods, various regions will always find a dense planting method that is more suitable for their local natural and economic conditions and that can best promote increased production.
    We can get a little inspiration from the development of dense planting experience: Increased production experience is not static, and we should view various increased production experiences with a developmental perspective. Even the increased production experiences that were effective in the past need to be re-examined based on production practice when conditions have undergone significant changes, to see what is still applicable, what needs to be revised, supplemented, and developed, and what is outdated and needs to be eliminated.

    要用发展的眼光看增产经验
    程浦
    全国小麦大丰收之后，紧跟着又来了早稻大丰收。不论小麦或者早稻，从它们的小面积的和大面积的高额丰产的经验来看，都有一条重要的技术措施，就是高度的密植。可以说，几乎没有一个亩产几千斤的高产纪录不跟密植有着密切的关系。密植，并不是新经验，老早以前就有这做法了，不过在小农经济时代，它不可能被普遍地运用。农业合作化以后，密植被当做一项重要的增产经验来推广。几年前，最流行的密植方法是“小棵密植”（有的地方也叫“小株密植”），人们认为这是最适当的密植方法。但是，今年许多地方所采取的密植方法，并不是一般的密植，而是高度的密植，密度比过去增加一两倍甚至好几倍。这样一来，过去人们关于密植经验的观念就被打破了。这个新变化使很多人解放了思想，进一步认识到土地的巨大增产潜力，增强了实现生产大跃进的信心。但是这个新变化也使另一些人困惑不安：过去提倡过的东西，现在又被否定了，这是怎么回事？
    其实这并不是什么奇怪的事情。任何一项生产经验都是一定生产条件下人们的生产实践的产物，生产条件因主观或客观的因素而不断地变化，人们关于生产的规律的知识也随着实践的发展而不断地丰富。因此，在生产实践的过程中，不但会获得新的生产经验，而且也会有一些生产经验被否定（由于原来这项经验并不符合生产发展的客观规律，或者由于这项经验不能适应已经改变了的生产条件），还会有一些生产经验进一步发展和丰富起来。密植的旧的密度标准和规格的被突破，就属于后一种情形。
    有人会说：前几年所推广的“适当密植”的方法，不是已被证明是能够增产的吗？是的，这种方法确是促进了生产的，过去推广这种方法，是成功的。但是，过去的密植，只是与从前个体农民所采用的落后的稀植比起来是密度增加了（它的进步性也在这里）。但是，今天大量的事实已经证明：采用密度更大的密植方法，可以更多地增产。本来密植这一措施的精髓，就是充分地利用阳光和地力，尽量增加单位面积上的作物株数、穗数（并且要求每穗上的籽粒多而饱满），从而获得更高的收获量。而密植又跟灌溉、肥料等条件有密切关系。在农业生产高潮出现以前，由于水利、肥料等条件较差，人们所认为的适当的密植，实际上并不算密。今天，水、肥、土等条件已经大大改善了，在这样的情况下，用密度更大的密植方法去代替过去那种密度较小的密植方法，就能更多地增产。
    那么，密植的密度到底有没有个限度呢？土地面积是有限的，单位面积上的作物的密度当然不可能是无限的。但是，现在一般农田的农作物的密度还不够，是个事实。那么究竟密到什么程度才算达到限度了呢？这恐怕现在很难轻易下个结论。现在，广东、福建和其他许多地区都要大力推广高度的密植，各地采用的密度标准和规格，种类非常多（如大株密植、中株密植、小株密植、单株密植、三角丛植、畦作密植、复式密植……），有的大同小异，有的差别不小，可以说是百花齐放，争艳斗妍。也许有些密植做法不尽合理，但这也无关紧要，经过不断的实践，经过人们对于土地增产潜力的不断探讨，经过人们对于各种密植方法的不断比较，各地总会找到更加适合于本地区自然条件和经济条件、最能促进增产的密植方法。
    从密植经验的发展中我们可以得到一点启示：增产经验不是一成不变的，我们应当用发展的眼光来看各种增产经验。哪怕是过去行之有效的增产经验，在条件发生了重要变化的情况下，也需要依据生产实践重新加以考察，看看哪些东西是仍然适用的，哪些东西是需要修改、补充和发展的，哪些东西是已经过时、需要淘汰的。
