　　This Dispatch from our Chongqing Office on August 25th: Chongqing held a rally yesterday to compete in setting "satellites," offering great gifts, and making further leaps forward. More than 3,000 leaders and employee representatives from industrial, mining, transportation, capital construction, and commercial enterprises across the city participated in the conference, and more than 300,000 employees across the city listened to the live broadcast of the conference. Prior to this, Chongqing had already organized a 100,000-person production inspection centered on completing and exceeding the state's industrial production plan.

　　At the broadcast rally, Ren Baige, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Chongqing, called on all employees in the city to make further leaps forward, guaranteeing the overfulfillment of this year's production plan, especially the leap forward plans for the iron and steel industry and the machinery industry.

　　At the meeting, the heads of seven industrial, mining, transportation, and capital construction units and three well-known advanced producers spoke. Hu Qiqian, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, on behalf of all employees of the company, proposed to guarantee that the company's steel and steel product output this year would double the actual completed figures of last year, and the output of refractory materials would increase by more than two times. Employees who listened to the live broadcast at various factories, mines, and construction sites also called in to participate in the competition.

　　Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has adopted many effective measures to rapidly increase production, ensuring the comprehensive completion of this year's leap forward plan. From January to July this year, although the output of steel and steel products has greatly increased compared with the same period last year, calculated according to the annual leap forward target, steel has only completed 45%, and steel products have only completed 48%. Most of the tasks must be completed in the next five months. In response to the weak links in production in the first half of this year, the company first focused on the two main production departments: steelmaking and steel rolling. Steelmaking is proceeding on two fronts, production and construction, to ensure a high-speed increase in steel production. The steelmaking workshop has already started to enlarge the open-hearth furnace body, doubling the open-hearth furnace capacity; at the same time, new steelmaking technologies such as external desulfurization and decarburization are being promoted to shorten the smelting time. In this way, the output of open-hearth steel can be increased by tens of thousands of tons this year. In addition to accelerating the construction of the new converter workshop, the capital construction department has also decided to launch a crash program to build a batch of new converters.

　　The steel rolling workshop is currently implementing various major measures to increase output from balancing equipment, revising operating procedures, and encouraging employees to continue to liberate their minds and break down old rules. The steel rolling workers build their own heating furnaces, manufacture their own machine tools and other equipment, and install them themselves, striving to increase the production capacity of major equipment as soon as possible.

### 鞍钢要向时间争夺钢铁  重钢保证今年产量倍增

　　鞍钢要向时间争夺钢铁  重钢保证今年产量倍增
    本报重庆25日电　重庆市昨天举行了放“卫星”、献大礼、跃进再跃进的比武誓师大会。全市各工矿、交通、基本建设、商业等企业的三千多名负责人和职工代表参加了大会，全市三十多万职工收听了大会实况扩播。在此以前，重庆市已开始围绕完成和超额完成国家工业生产计划，组织了十万人的生产大检查。
    在广播大会上，中共重庆市委书记、重庆市市长任白戈号召全市职工跃进再跃进，保证超额完成今年的生产计划，特别是钢铁工业和机械工业的生产跃进计划。
    会上，有七个工矿、交通、基本建设单位的负责人和三个著名的先进生产者发了言。重庆钢铁公司党委副书记胡其谦代表全公司职工提出，保证今年全公司的钢和钢材的产量比去年实际完成数字增加一倍，耐火材料增加两倍以上。在各厂矿各工地收听实况广播的职工，也纷纷打电话来参加比武。
    重庆钢铁公司采取许多迅速提高生产的有效措施，保证全面完成今年的跃进计划。公司今年1至7月份，虽然钢和钢材的产量都比去年同时增长很大，按全年跃进指标计算，钢却只完成了45％，钢材只完成了48％。大部分任务要在今后五个月内完成。针对今年上半年生产中的薄弱环节，这个公司首先抓住了炼钢、轧钢两个主要生产部门。炼钢方面从生产上和建设上双管齐下，保证钢产量高速度增加。炼钢车间已动手将平炉炉体改大，把平炉容量加大一倍；同时推广炉外脱硫、脱炭等新炼钢技术，缩短冶炼时间。这样，今年平炉钢产量可以增加几万吨。基本建设部门除了加快新建转炉车间的建设外，还决定再突击建设一批新转炉。
    轧钢车间目前正从平衡设备、修改工艺规程、鼓励职工继续解放思想破除陈规等方面，贯彻提高产量的各项重大措施。轧钢工人们自己动手修建加热炉，自造机床和其他设备，自己安装，力争尽快提高主要设备的生产能力。（附图片）
