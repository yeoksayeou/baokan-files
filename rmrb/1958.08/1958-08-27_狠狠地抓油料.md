　　Firmly Grasp Oil Production
    With the resolution of the grain problem, the oil problem has become more prominent. In fact, solving the oil problem is not difficult; the key lies in whether the leadership grasps it and whether they grasp it firmly.
    Increased sunflower production is one example. This year, thanks to the leadership's attention and the commencement of large-scale planting, total production will increase threefold compared to last year. The situation for other oil crops is no different. Why could Fujian release a high-yield peanut "satellite"? Why could Gansu release a rapeseed "satellite"? Isn't it because of strengthened leadership?
    Now, the key to strengthening leadership lies in earnestly strengthening the later-stage field management of oil crops, comprehensively promoting the successful experiences of high-yield "satellites," and ensuring that oil production and grain/cotton production advance in tandem.

### 狠狠地抓油料

　　狠狠地抓油料
    随着粮食问题的解决，油料问题显得更加突出了。其实，解决油料问题并不困难，关键在于领导是不是去抓，有没有狠狠地抓。
    向日葵增产就是一个例子，今年由于领导重视，开始了大面积种植，总产量就要比去年增产三倍。其它油料作物的情况也不例外，福建为什么能够放出花生高产“卫星”？甘肃为什么会放出油菜籽“卫星”？还不是由于加强了领导。
    现在加强领导的关键，就在于认真加强油料作物的后期田间管理，全面推广高产“卫星”的丰收经验，保证油料生产和粮棉齐头跃进。
