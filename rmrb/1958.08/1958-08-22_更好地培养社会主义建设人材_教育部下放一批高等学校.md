Xinhua News Agency report:

In order to further strengthen the Party's leadership over higher education, secondary specialized education, and technical schools, give play to the initiative of local areas in running schools, and better cultivate suitable talents needed in socialist construction, a batch of higher education institutions, secondary specialized schools, and technical schools under the leadership of the Ministry of Education and the central ministries in charge of specific industries have recently been decentralized to be managed by various local areas. Of the fifty-three higher education institutions originally directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, except for seven, including Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Sichuan University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Russian Language Institute, and Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, which remain directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Education and guide the entire country, the remaining thirty-nine are decentralized to be led by provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and seven are handed over to the leadership of relevant central industrial ministries. Of the forty-seven higher education institutions originally directly under the leadership of the central industrial ministries, twenty-one have been decentralized. After adjustments, of the existing two hundred and twenty-seven higher education institutions nationwide, forty are led by the Ministry of Education and the central industrial ministries, and one hundred and eighty-seven are placed under the leadership of local areas. There are currently one thousand three hundred and eighteen secondary specialized schools nationwide. Of the original two hundred and fifty-two schools under the leadership of the central ministries, one hundred and fifty-four have been decentralized. Of the existing one hundred and forty-four technical schools nationwide, which were originally under the separate leadership of the central competent departments and labor departments, seventy-five have now been decentralized.

Those schools which are still directly under the leadership of the central ministries in administrative terms are mainly led by the central competent ministries; for schools decentralized to local areas, the power of management, including cadres, teachers, finance, etc., is handed over to the relevant provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees. In the future, the central Ministry of Education will focus its main efforts on the overall planning of education at all levels, developing cutting-edge specialties in science and technology, training teachers, organizing and formulating guiding teaching plans and syllabuses, organizing the compilation and examination of teaching materials, guiding teaching and scientific research work, and exchanging advanced experiences, etc., and will work with the relevant central departments to help local areas run schools well. All schools, whether directly led by the relevant central departments or decentralized to local leadership, will uniformly obey the needs of the national socialist construction cause. For decentralized higher education institutions, in addition to ensuring the completion of the original central planned tasks, if the central government proposes new and urgent tasks, the local areas should also try to complete them if conditions permit; for the schools retained by the central government, in addition to guaranteeing the completion of the original central planned tasks, if the local areas propose tasks to train talents on their behalf, the relevant central departments will also try to meet the local requirements. In terms of cadres and teachers, the central and local governments will also consult with each other and transfer personnel as needed. In the future, graduates of higher education institutions will be assigned by the relevant central departments and local areas, depending on the different nature of the schools or specialties and the needs of the state.

　　更好地培养社会主义建设人材
    教育部下放一批高等学校
    据新华社讯  为了进一步加强党对高等教育、中等专业教育以及技工学校的领导，发挥地方办学校的积极性，更好地培养社会主义建设中所需要的合适的人材，教育部和中央各业务部门领导的一批高等学校、中等专业学校和技工学校最近期间下放各地方管理。原由教育部直接领导的五十三所高等学校，除中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、四川大学、北京师范大学、北京俄语学院、北京外国语学院等七所仍由教育部直接领导、指导全国外，其余三十九所下放归省、市、自治区领导，七所交中央有关业务部门领导，原由中央各业务部门直接领导的四十七所高等学校中，有二十一所下放。全国现有二百二十七所高等学校，经过调整后，由教育部和中央各业务部门领导的有四十所，划归地方领导的有一百八十七所。现在全国共有一千三百一十八所中等专业学校，原来由中央各部门领导的二百五十二所中有一百五十四所下放。全国现有的一百四十四所技工学校，原来都属中央各主管部门和劳动部门分别领导，现在有七十五所下放。
    这些学校在行政上仍由中央各部直接领导的，以中央主管部领导为主；下放地方的学校，管理权包括干部、教师、财务等都交地方有关省、市、自治区党委领导。今后中央教育部以重要力量从事各级教育事业的全面规划、发展科学技术上的尖端专业、训练培养师资、组织制定指导性的教学计划教学大纲、组织编审教材、指导教学和科学研究工作、交流先进经验等方面，协同中央各有关部门帮助地方办好学校。所有的学校无论由中央有关部门直接领导或下放交地方领导。都统一服从国家社会主义建设事业的需要，下放的高等学校，地方除了保证完成中央原定的计划任务以外，如中央提出新的急迫任务，在条件许可下地方也要设法完成；中央保留的学校，中央各主管部门除了保证中央原定的计划任务以外，如地方提出代为培养人材的任务，中央各主管部门也设法满足地方的要求。干部、教师等方面，中央和地方也根据需要相互协商互调。今后高等学校毕业生，按学校或专业的不同性质以及国家的需要，分别由中央有关部门和地方分配。
