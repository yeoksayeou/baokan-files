The wisdom of the masses is inexhaustible
People in twelve provinces including Sichuan have created more than 600 kinds of indigenous methods and tools for eliminating the four pests

    (Our report) In the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, the broad masses in twelve provinces including Sichuan and Anhui have created more than 600 kinds of indigenous methods and tools for eliminating the four pests, and have also discovered some wild plants with insecticidal effects. These indigenous tools and methods use local materials, cost little or no money, and have played a significant role in eliminating the four pests.

    All localities attach great importance to the work of collecting and promoting indigenous methods and tools for eliminating the four pests. Gansu Province has established a special wild plant insecticide investigation team to explore wild plants in the Tianshui area. They adopted the method of collecting experiments, summarizing and promoting at the same time, and conducted on-site experiments on 53 kinds of wild plants, proving that 33 of them can kill maggots. Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, established a wild plant research institute, which has preliminarily tested and identified 31 kinds of wild plants that can kill maggots. Fifteen kinds of wild plants can kill 80% of maggots within four to five hours, and one kind of "Qitouhao" can kill all maggots within five hours. The Anhui Provincial Anti-epidemic Station sent people to Jinzhai, Nanling, Wuhu and other places to conduct experiments on wild plants. After testing, it was proved that 15 kinds of plants can kill fly maggots, 13 kinds can kill mosquito larvae, 4 kinds can kill snails, and 3 kinds can kill schistosomiasis eggs. Thirteen women in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province, built the country's first "Peace" wild plant pharmaceutical factory, and they also opened a medicinal herb garden. At present, the factory has produced and sold a kind of "Broken Bowl Flower Compound", which can kill all fly maggots within two hours, and the price is 95% cheaper than "666".

    Various localities have also created many indigenous tools for eliminating the four pests. Zhang Zhiyu of Caojia Agricultural Cooperative in Pingba Township, Guzhang County, Hunan Province, created a rat trapping method that can catch more than 40 rats at a time. The "slate machine" used and promoted in Shuangbai County, Yunnan Province, can be made with only a few pieces of bamboo, and the rat trapping effect is very good. In addition, indigenous tools such as the bamboo bow sparrow shooting method and the brick cat sparrow killing method also have very good sparrow trapping effects.

　　群众的智慧取之不尽
　　四川等十二省群众创造除四害土办法、土工具六百多种
    本报讯　四川、安徽等十二个省的广大群众在以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动中，已创造了六百多种除四害的土办法、土工具，也发现了一些有杀虫效果的野生植物。这些土工具、土办法都是就地取材，不花钱或花钱很少，对于消灭四害起了很大的作用。
    各地对于搜集和推广除四害土办法、土工具的工作都很重视。甘肃省专门成立了植物杀虫药调查组，到天水专区进行发掘野生植物的工作。他们采取边采集实验、边总结推广的方法，对五十三种野生植物进行了现场实验，证明其中有三十三种能够灭蛆。四川江津县成立了野生植物研究所，已经初步试验鉴定能够杀蛆的有三十一种野生植物，有十五种野生植物在四、五小时内就可以杀蛆80％，有一种“齐头蒿”在五小时内就可以把蛆全部杀死。安徽省防疫站派人到金寨、南陵、芜湖市等地进行有关野生植物的试验，经过试验证明，能够杀蝇蛆的有十五种，能杀孑孓的有十三种，能毒杀钉螺的四种，能毒杀血吸虫卵的三种。贵州镇远县十三个妇女建成一座全国首创的“和平”野生植物药厂，她们还开辟了一个药圃。目前，这个厂已制销一种“打破碗花花合剂”，用这种药在两小时内可以杀死全部蝇蛆，价格比“六六六”便宜95％。
    各地还创造了许多除四害的土工具。湖南古丈县坪坝乡曹家农业社张志玉创造的诱鼠法，一次就可以捕鼠四十多只。云南双柏县推广使用的捕鼠工具“石板机”，只用几片竹子就能制成，而且捕鼠效果很好。此外，如竹弓打雀法、砖猫灭雀法等土工具，捕雀效果也很好。
