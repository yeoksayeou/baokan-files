Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has wantonly sabotaged Fujian's coastal fishing production, and the vast number of fishermen are angrily accusing and denouncing the crimes of the Jiang gang.

The Jiang army, entrenched on the Matsu Islands, Wuqiu Islands, Baiquan Islands and other islands along the Fujian coast, recently repeatedly robbed and harassed Fujian fishermen who were fishing in the Taiwan Strait, seizing boats, arresting young and middle-aged fishermen, and looting large quantities of fish and other property, causing great losses to the fishermen. Three fishing cooperatives in Meihua Town, Putian County, had five fishing boats robbed by the Jiang army on the Matsu Islands, fifty-one fishermen arrested, three fishermen injured, and more than 1,500 dan of fish and thirteen chickens looted. Fishermen in Chongwu Peninsula, Hui'an County, had five fishing boats robbed and more than 100 fishermen arrested by the Jiang army while fishing at sea. Huangqi Peninsula in Lianjiang County, which faces the Matsu Islands across the sea, is one of the fishing areas most severely damaged by the Jiang army. Over the years, hundreds of fishing boats have been robbed by the Jiang army and more than 120 fishermen have been arrested. Some of the arrested fishermen were buried alive, some were burned to death with sulfuric acid, and some were forced to become Jiang soldiers. The Jiang army also often shells fishing villages. Lin Naizhen, a fisherman on Huangqi Peninsula, was killed by Jiang army shells, and his wife and two sons were wounded.

Fujian fishermen, who have a sea of blood and deep hatred with American imperialism and the Jiang gang, have recently been holding meetings everywhere to accuse American imperialism of directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to intensify the tense situation in the Taiwan region. The vast number of fishermen are determined to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan as soon as possible by greatly increasing production and strengthening and consolidating coastal defense. Fishermen on Huangqi Peninsula recently held an unprecedented accusation meeting and demonstration parade on the front-line beach. The fishermen firmly stated: we have boats if needed, and people if needed, and are ready at any time to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the enemy-occupied islands such as the Matsu Islands, and eliminating the remaining Jiang army. After the demonstration parade, the fishermen launched a high tide of summer fishing production. Fishermen on Nanri Island, Putian County, who are often subjected to sabotage and robbery by the Jiang army, held a meeting to denounce and accuse the crimes of the US-Chiang and after that, forty-four fishing boats went out to sea to fish in heavy rain for days.

When fishermen go out to sea to fish, they are strongly protected by the PLA troops stationed on the front lines of Fujian. Once, a certain artillery unit of the PLA guarding the coastal defense frontline discovered that the Jiang army entrenched on the Matsu Islands had sent two motorized sailing boats disguised as Australian ships in an attempt to attack fishing boats fishing on the sea. Our artillery unit immediately bombarded the enemy ships with fierce artillery fire, causing the enemy to flee in panic, and the fishermen were able to produce safely. Another time, a certain artillery unit on the coastal defense outpost discovered that the Jiang army, hiding on the Baiquan Islands, was capturing fishermen and shelling fishing boats at sea, and immediately opened fire to bombard them, causing the enemy ships to flee in all directions.

    福建渔民愤怒控诉和声讨蒋帮罪行
    决心增加生产支援解放台湾
    新华社福州3日电　蒋介石集团大肆破坏福建沿海渔业生产，广大渔民愤怒控诉和声讨蒋帮罪行。
    盘踞在福建沿海马祖列岛、乌丘屿、白犬列岛等岛屿上的蒋军，不久前曾多次抢劫和袭扰正在台湾海峡各渔场捕鱼的福建渔民，抢走船只，抓走青壮年渔民，劫去大批鱼产和其他财物，使渔民遭受很大损失。莆田县梅花镇三个渔业社曾被马祖列岛的蒋军抢去渔船五只，抓走渔民五十一人，打伤渔民三人，抢去鱼产一千五百多担，鸡十三只。惠安县崇武半岛的渔民，一次在海上捕鱼时，被蒋军劫去渔船五条，抓走渔民一百多人。和马祖列岛隔海相对的连江县黄岐半岛是遭受蒋军破坏最严重的渔区之一。几年来，被蒋军抢去成百条渔船，抓去一百二十多个渔民。被抓去的渔民中有的被活埋，有的被用硫酸水烧死，有的被迫当蒋军。蒋军还时常炮轰渔村，黄岐半岛上的渔民林乃珍被蒋军炮弹打死，他的妻子和两个儿子被炸伤。
    同美帝以及蒋帮有血海深仇的福建渔民，最近到处集会控诉美帝指使蒋介石集团加剧台湾地区紧张局势的罪恶活动。广大渔民决心以大量增加生产，加强和巩固海防等实际行动，来支援解放军早日解放台湾。黄岐半岛的渔民最近在前沿海滩上举行了空前规模的控诉会和游行示威。渔民们坚决表示：要船有船，要人有人，随时准备支援解放军解放台湾和马祖列岛等敌占岛屿，消灭残余蒋军。示威游行以后，渔民们就掀起了夏季渔业生产高潮。时常遭受蒋军破坏、抢劫的莆田县南日岛渔民，举行集会声讨和控诉美蒋罪行后，四十四条渔船连日冒着大雨出海捕鱼。
    渔民出海捕鱼时，受到驻福建前线的解放军各部队的有力保护。一次，守卫在海防前线的解放军某炮兵部队，发现盘踞在马祖列岛上的蒋军派出二条伪装澳船的机帆船，企图袭击正在海面捕鱼的渔船，我炮兵部队立即以猛烈炮火轰击敌船，打得敌人狼狈回逃，渔民得以安全生产。另一次，海防前哨某炮兵部队发现龟缩在白犬列岛上的蒋军在海上抓捕渔民和炮击渔船，立即开炮轰击，打得敌船四处逃窜。
