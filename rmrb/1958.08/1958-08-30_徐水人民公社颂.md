　　Ode to the Xushui People's Commune
　　5. Xie坊: A Civilized and Urbanized Village
　　Special Correspondent of this newspaper: Kang Zhuo
    Xie坊 in the Suicheng People's Commune is a civilized and urbanized village. This village of over three hundred households not only runs its kindergartens and homes for the elderly very well, but is also full of culture, happiness, and the paradise of millions of people's dreams. Anyone who visits there for the first time will be amazed at how rapidly China's rural construction can leap forward, and how satellites like Xie坊 can appear today.
    Xie坊 is backed by the famous Puhe River of Xushui to the north and borders the highway from Chengguan to Dawangdian to the south. From the main highway, a standard branch line eight meters wide leads directly to the village. Before merging into the Suicheng Commune, this was the Hongqi Commune, and the branch highway was built by the Young Pioneers, so it is called the "Hongqi Commune Young Pioneers Highway." The branch line is half a *li* long. Going north into the village from the south, there is a wooden sign on the east side of the road that says "Open-air Square," which is a clean and spacious place in the woods, a great place to hold commune member meetings and small evening parties. A larger field with sparser trees on the west side of the road is the livestock competition field. All the livestock of the production teams are evaluated every ten days, and red, yellow, and black flags are awarded. Those who win the red flag three times are given material rewards. From the livestock competition field to the north, the west side of the road is the Children's Park. Looking north, the pink and white high walls of the village soar into the sky, depicting the prospects of the motherland's industrialization and our vast and boundless ocean. Everywhere there are large-character slogans, the main points of the General Line, and street poems. Following the highway branch line into the village, the first intersection and the poetry and painting area to the west is the kindergarten, and to the east is the nursery and the home for the elderly; both east and west are also spacious avenues. Continuing along the highway straight into the village, on the west side of the road is a tall white wall more than a hundred meters long, with a whole banner written on it, each character larger than a millstone. Through the characters of the slogan, a long row of colorful paintings depicts the prosperity of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, as well as the sea, land, and air forces; the slogans and paintings overlap and complement each other, conveying endless grandeur and beauty. At the end of this high wall is the second intersection, and the east-west direction is also a standard highway. Going west, there are poetry and painting areas on both sides again. The first gate on the north side of the road is the former headquarters of the Hongqi Commune. This gate is called the Leap Forward Gate, and the wall above the gate opening is written with the poem:
    A Leap Forward Gate is built in the village,
    All the villagers smile happily.
    Seven characters are written on the gate,
    Firmly achieve the double thousand *jin*.
    Please allow me to omit the following eight lines of poetry and quickly go into the courtyard to take a look. In the northwest corner of the courtyard is an auditorium that can accommodate seven hundred people. Looking straight from the podium of the auditorium to the wall opposite the gate, a panoramic view of the village's construction plan is clearly visible, with red buildings and white bungalows, green water, green trees, and factories. How many photos have photographers taken by this inspiring wall! Of course, more important is the auditorium's magnificent style. It was built using the former landlord's distillery factory buildings. The Xie坊, surnamed Qi, landlord used to be famous for a while. Now, the good houses built by the laboring people for the landlord can greatly facilitate the standardization of village construction after the property is returned to its rightful owners.
    Behind the auditorium is the bathhouse, with the three large characters "Happiness Pool" written on the gate. Inside, it can accommodate fifty people to rest, and the pool can accommodate thirty people to bathe; the *kang* is covered with reed mats and white sheets, and at the end of the *kang* is the barber shop. Commune members can take baths and haircuts for free with vouchers, rotating between men and women. Leaving the bathhouse, looking at a row of south-facing houses, there are the former commune headquarters, the pig farm feeder cultural school, the Party branch school, and the Communist Youth League branch school. When asked if these schools hold classes on time, village branch secretary Zhu Chunsheng replied that they all do. Zhu Chunsheng is shy, simple, and doesn't say much, but he was once a decorated soldier who galloped across the battlefield. This village originally did not have a strong foundation. It was only after Zhu Chunsheng returned to the village, with the help of commune party secretary Wang Qi, uniting party members and relying on the masses, that a clear red flag was gradually established in the village. One of the magic weapons of his leadership work is those two branch schools. He is a hard-working and pragmatic promoter. A poem in the courtyard writes out the source of his invincibility, the poem is titled "Heaven-Opening Axe," and the lines are:
    Pangu opened the sky and created the earth,
    The Party's instructions are the Heaven-Opening Axe.
    Everyone picks up this axe,
    All great difficulties are swept away.
    Going north from the courtyard, accompanied by a green expanse of multi-eared corn, to the pig farm. There are entry instructions written at the door and a disinfection station is set up. Inside the door, large urns of silage feed are lined up against the south wall. Of the village's six hundred and eighty-two pigs, three hundred live here, a total of ninety pens, including eighty-two sows and two boars. The pens are so clean that there are no flies or smells. The top of the pens is shaded, and each row of pig pens also has an electric light. Not far from the gate, by the well, there is a brick-built pig bathing pool; outside the northwest wall, there is a pig playground. The piglets crawl through the holes under the wall, eat specially laid-out pumpkin leaves in the playground, and roll around, resulting in rapid growth. Inside the northeast wall is the feeder's dormitory, with big-character posters at the door and pig files in the room. Each pig has a file recording its number, gender, date of birth, weight, vaccination status, and mating and farrowing periods. Outside the pig farm, there is also a pig clinic and isolation room.
    Please don't think this is a pig's paradise. In the southeast corner of the village's second intersection is a public toilet with cold cloth, new doors, and murals; opposite the toilet is a satellite pig farm. There are forty pens and sixty pigs there, the largest of which weighs more than five hundred *jin*, like a water buffalo. Five pigs had their thyroid glands removed and are growing rapidly, with a target of one thousand, two thousand, or even five thousand *jin* each. The walls of the satellite pig pen are one meter high, the lower half is made of brick, pointed and grouted, and painted with white lime and flowers and plants; the upper half is a pattern woven from tile tubes. The wall at the northern end in the middle of the pig farm depicts the famous Puhe Reservoir in the county. The walls of the pens are painted with satellite pigs that cranes cannot lift, and the edges of the pens are shaded with bright blue painted sunshades. Outside the pens, there are underground sewers for when it rains. The entrance to the pig farm also has entry instructions and a disinfection station. The gate is two wooden fences, with green lacquered edges. The wooden strips in the middle are red-edged with a white center, and the wooden frame on the top of the door has the red painted characters "Satellite Pig Farm". Two stone lions that used to guard the landlord's gate sit on either side of the gate. These lions are now lucky, defending the satellite pigs in an imposing manner and interacting with the satellite pigs to enhance each other's prestige.
    The civilization of Xie坊 is endless, and the enthusiasm of the people of Xie坊 is even more inexhaustible. When guests arrive, people everywhere applaud to welcome them. The men and women here are clean and culturally exposed. The canteen cooks and commune members are all fluent in answering questions, so that some guests call this place the Land of Politeness and the Kingdom of Gentlemen. There are also guest houses with bright windows and clean *kangs*. There is also a free medical clinic. The clinic has three treatment rooms, three wards, and two maternity rooms in the inner courtyard; there are stone tables and benches under the melon shed in the courtyard. West of the clinic is the club, which has musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting, as well as more than forty musical instruments such as drums, trumpets, flutes, *huqin*, and accordions, as well as table tennis, badminton, and basketball. The club also has men's and women's basketball teams, table tennis teams, and badminton teams, as well as a band, a drama team, a singing team, a dance team, and a writing group. The director of the club is a beautiful, serious, and enthusiastic girl. Because a seven-level wage system has been implemented here, someone asked about the girl's salary; she smiled lightly and said:
    "Working for communism, who cares about wages!"
    West of the club, there is a fish pond where thousands of fish swim, and next to the pond is a reading room equipped with eight kinds of newspapers; in a large courtyard further west is a power station and a grain processing factory. Looking back to the east, see the Red and Expert University diagonally opposite the club. There are sixty-four students here, with three classes every afternoon and two self-study sessions. The courses include Chinese, arithmetic, agricultural technology, and sports, and have not yet been divided into departments. The university sports field has various ball courts, sandpits, and parallel bars. The library has more than a thousand books and periodicals. The village's exhibition room is also located in this courtyard. This university is truly a bit reluctant to leave. Just as Xie坊 occupies the upper reaches of the county's two hundred and ninety-three singing teams and one hundred and ten dance teams, among the county's one hundred and one universities and six thousand two hundred university students that are preparing to be merged, the university and students here are also among the best.
    It is not necessary to describe the large supply and marketing cooperative west of the original commune headquarters, and the clothing factory with twelve sewing machines opposite the supply and marketing cooperative, nor can I fully record the long poem praising the People's Commune written on the high wall between the headquarters and the cooperative. But I must record the first few sentences of this long poem:
    Xie坊 is a happy village,
    Happiness all lies in the commune being long.
    The benefits of the commune cannot be sung enough,
    Collective strength creates paradise!
    Who can say that this is not a paradise of happiness! And the precious thing about this paradise is that Xie坊 is not a key village in the county's work. It was only when Wang Qingshan, the third secretary of the county party committee, came here more than half a month ago and discovered the project of creating paradise here that he stayed to provide some assistance. Wang Qingshan, this strong and vigorous middle-aged man, this cadre of peasant and military background, always says that he has no culture, but how many outstanding and civilized opinions has he provided for the construction of Xie坊!
    Party Secretary Wang Qi and Branch Secretary Zhu Chunsheng also have common characteristics with Wang Qingshan. Zhu Chunsheng is even not satisfied with the construction of the village. When the number of visitors is gradually increasing, he tries his best not to delay work at all, and finds a few young girls to be receptionists and guides. These girls are all civilized and hardworking, and are highly praised by the guests. In fact, everyone in the village is the same as them, because this is a civilized world, a cultural countryside.

　　徐水人民公社颂
　　五、文明而城市化的谢坊
　　本报特约记者  康濯
    遂城人民公社的谢坊，是一个文明而城市化的村子。这个三百多户的村庄不仅幼儿园和幸福院办得很好，而且处处是文化，是幸福，是千万人梦里的天堂。不论是谁，第一次到了那里，都会惊叹于中国农村的建设竟能飞跃得如此神速，竟能在今天就出现谢坊似的卫星。
    谢坊北靠徐水有名的瀑河，南临城关通向大王店的公路。从公路干线上有一条八公尺宽的标准支线直通村子。这里在并到遂城公社以前是红旗公社，这条公路支线是少先队员修成的，就名叫“红旗公社红领巾公路”。支线长半里，往北进村南，路东有木牌，上写“露天广场”，那是树林里一个清洁宽敞的所在，举行社员大会和小型晚会的胜地。路西一个树木较稀的更大的场子，是牲畜比赛场。所有生产连队的牲口每十天评比一次，评出红黄黑旗，连得三次红旗的给予物质奖励。从牲畜比赛场往北，路西是幼儿公园。抬头北望，村里直冲半天空的粉白高墙画着祖国工业化的前景，和我们辽阔无边的海洋。到处是大字标语，是总路线要点，是街头诗。顺公路支线进村，从第一个十字路口和诗画区往西是幼儿园，往东是托儿所和幸福院；东西所向也是宽敞的大道。再顺公路朝村内直走，路西一面百多公尺长的高大白墙，上面写着一整幅标语，每一个字比碾盘还大。透过标语字，画着一大长溜工农商学兵以及海陆空全部繁荣兴旺的彩画；标语和彩画重叠着交相辉映，说不尽的雄伟和美妙。这面高墙的尽头，就是第二个十字路口，东西所向也是标准的大公路。往西行，两旁又是诗画之区。路北第一个大门，是原来红旗公社的社部。这座大门叫跃进门，门洞的墙头写着诗句道：
    村上搭起跃进门，
    全村社员笑吟吟。
    门上写着七个字，
    坚决实现双千斤。
    请让我省略以下的八行诗句，赶快进院去看看。院里西北角是一个能容七百人的礼堂，从礼堂讲台上直望大门对面的墙头，一幅本村建设的规划图景历历在目，上面有红色的楼房和白色的平房，有绿水绿树和工厂。摄影记者们在这动人心魄的墙边拍过多少照片啊！当然，更重要的还是礼堂的雄伟气派。这是利用过去地主的酒厂厂房修建的。谢坊姓祁的地主在旧日曾经名震一时，现在，劳动人民给地主盖的好房在物归原主以后，可大大便利了村庄建设的规格化。
    礼堂的后面是澡堂，大门上写着“幸福池”三个大字。里面能容五十个人休息，池子能洗三十个人；炕上铺着苇席和白被单，炕的尽头是理发室。社员们都凭券免费洗澡理发，男女轮流。出澡堂，望一片南房，有过去的社部，有猪场饲养员文化学校，有党支部学校和团支部学校。有人问起这些学校是不是都按时上课，村支部书记朱春生回答说，都按时。朱春生腼腆、朴素、话语不多，但却曾是一个驰骋疆场的荣誉军人。这个村子原来基础并不强，是朱春生回村以后，在公社党委书记王岐的帮助下，团结党团员和依靠群众，才逐渐在村里树起鲜明的红旗。他的领导工作的法宝之一，就是那两座支部学校。他是一个苦干实干的促进派。院里一首诗写出了他无往不胜的根源，诗名“开天斧”，诗句是：
    开地辟地说盘古，
    党的指示就是开天斧。
    人人拿起这把斧，
    天大困难全扫除。
    从院里往北，伴着一片绿乌乌的多穗玉米前行，到猪场。门口写有入场须知，设有消毒处。门里靠南墙摆满了青储饲料的大瓮。全村六百八十二口猪，这里住着三百口，共九十个圈，其中有八十二口母猪和两口公猪。圈里干净得无苍蝇无臭味，圈顶有遮阳，每排猪圈还有一盏电灯。大门不远处的井边，设有砖砌的猪浴池；西北面的墙外设有小猪游艺场，小猪从墙下的洞口钻过去，在游艺场里叨吃专铺的北瓜叶，并且乱滚乱跑，那结果就是长得快。东北面墙里是饲养员的宿舍，宿舍门口有大字报，屋里有猪档案。每口猪一份档案，记载着号码、性别、出生年月、体重、预防注射的情况，以及交配期和分娩期。猪场外面还有猪诊疗所和隔离室。
    请不要以为这就是猪的天堂。村里的第二个十字路口，东南角是冷布、新门和画有壁画的公共厕所；厕所对面，有一个卫星猪场。那里四十个圈和六十口猪，最大的已经五百多斤，跟水牛一样。有五口猪割了甲状腺，正在飞速生长，要求是每口一千、二千甚至五千斤。卫星猪圈墙高一公尺，下半截磨砖对缝，刷了白灰，画了花草；上半截是瓦筒编的图案。猪场中间最北头的墙上，画的是本县有名的瀑河水库。圈墙上画了起重机都吊不动卫星猪，圈檐边是鲜蓝油漆的遮阳板，圈外有下雨时候的地下水道。猪场门口也有入场须知和消毒处。大门是两扇木栅栏，绿漆栏边，中间的木条是红边白心，门顶木框中有“卫星猪场”几个红油大字。大门两边坐着两座过去给地主把门的石狮子，这对狮子如今交了好运，在不可一世地捍卫着卫星猪，并和卫星猪交相影响着互长威风。
    写不完的谢坊的文明，更说不尽谢坊人的热烈情绪。客人来了，哪里都有人鼓掌欢迎，这里的男女又穿戴干净和文化外露，食堂的炊事员和社员都个个对答如流，以至有的客人把这儿叫作礼貌乡和君子国。这里还有窗明炕净的招待所。也有免费医疗的卫生所。卫生所院里有三间诊疗室，三间病房，和里院的两间产妇室；院内瓜棚架下有石桌和长凳。从卫生所往西是俱乐部，里边有琴棋书画，有鼓、号、笛、胡琴和手风琴等四十多件乐器，有乒乓球、羽毛球和篮球。俱乐部里并有男女篮球队、乒乓球队和羽毛球队，有乐队、戏剧队、歌咏队、舞蹈队和写作组。俱乐部主任是个漂亮、严肃而热情的姑娘，由于这里已经实行了七级工资制，就曾有人问到这位姑娘的工资；她却轻俏地笑道：
    “给共产主义干活，谁还计较工资呢！”
    从俱乐部往西，有个游息着几千尾鱼的养鱼池，池边是备有八种报纸的阅报室；再往西的一个大院里，是发电站和粮食加工厂。回头还看东面，看俱乐部对角的红专大学。这里有六十四个学生，每天下午上三节课，自习两节。课程有语文、算术、农业技术和体育，暂时还没分系。大学运动场有各种球场，有沙坑和单双杠。图书馆有一千多册书刊。村里的展览室也设在这个院里。这座大学真有点儿使人留恋难返。正跟在全县二百九十三个歌咏队和一百一十个舞蹈队中谢坊都占据上游一样，在全县准备要合并的一百零一所大学和六千二百多大学生中，这里的大学和学生也都是处于最好的行列之中的。
    不必叙述原来公社社部西头的宽大的供销部，和供销部对面十二台缝纫机的被服厂，也不能全部记下社部和供销部之间的高墙上写的那首歌颂人民公社的长诗。但我必须记下这首长诗的开头几句：
    谢坊是个幸福庄，
    幸福全在公社长。
    公社好处唱不尽，
    集体力量造天堂！
    谁能说这里不是幸福的天堂！而这个天堂的可贵之处，还在于谢坊并不是县里工作中的重点村。只是县委第三书记汪清山在半个多月以前来到这里，发现了这里创造天堂的工程，才留下进行了一些帮助。汪清山，这个粗壮而有魄力的中年人，这个农民和打仗出身的干部，总说自己没有文化，但却给谢坊的建设提供了多少杰出的文明的意见啊！
    党委书记王岐和支书朱春生，也都和汪清山有着共同的特点。朱春生甚至还并不满意村里的建设，在如今参观者逐渐增多的时候，都尽量争取一点都不耽误工作，而找了几个年轻姑娘当招待员和响导。这些姑娘都是文明的好劳动，受到客人们极大的称赞。其实村里所有的人也都和她们一样，因为这里是文明的天地，是文化的城乡。
