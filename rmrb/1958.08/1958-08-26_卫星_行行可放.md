"Satellite" Can Be Launched in Every Field
    Since the summer harvest, on the agricultural front, satellites have been launched one after another. Superstitions have been broken, morale boosted, and the whole country is jubilant.

  Is it only agriculture that can launch "satellites"? Of course not. Wouldn't it allow a new kind of superstition to be established if we concluded that only agriculture can launch "satellites"?

    A "satellite" is a new high-yield record. It means that people engaged in material production use their special dynamic role—creativity—to uncover the secrets of nature, break with convention, and create new production records that predecessors dared not imagine. Since this is the case, if agriculture can launch satellites, why can't industry? Every producer in every field can launch satellites. Taking industrial production as an example, what is urgently needed now is to launch satellites that complete the leap forward plan ahead of schedule and beyond quotas. The Deqing Machine Factory in Tianjin completed this year's production leap forward plan five months ahead of schedule, becoming the first satellite among industrial enterprises in Tianjin to complete the plan. Perhaps industrial production satellites are not easily comparable to agricultural production satellites, but this does not hinder the basic purpose of launching satellites: through satellites—the advanced—to drive the entire industrial and agricultural production to a great leap forward.

　　“卫星”行行可放
    从夏收以来，农业战线上，卫星一个接着一个上天，迷信破除，人心振奋，举国欢腾。
  难道只有农业可以放“卫星”吗？当然不是。如果得出只有农业可放“卫星”的结论，岂不又容许一种新的迷信成立吗？
    “卫星”是高产的新纪录。即从事物质生产的人，以自己特殊的能动作用——创造力，揭开自然的秘密，打破常规，创造了前人所不敢设想的生产新纪录。既然如此，农业可放卫星，工业又何尝不可。行行生产者，都可放卫星。以工业生产来说，当前急需放提前和超额完成跃进计划的卫星。天津的德庆机器厂，提前五个月完成了今年的生产跃进计划，成为天津市工业企业完成计划的第一颗卫星。也许工业生产的卫星和农业生产的卫星不大好比较，但这并不妨碍放卫星的基本目的：通过卫星——先进者，带动整个工农业生产向前大跃进。
