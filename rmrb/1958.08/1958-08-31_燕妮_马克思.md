    Jenny Marx
    Jenny Marx shared her life with Marx, enduring countless hardships. The couple devoted their limited resources entirely to the cause of the workers' movement. Poverty and life in exile caused her to lose three of her beloved children. Throughout her life, she was accustomed to frequenting pawnshops, selling furniture, constantly borrowing money, and dealing with landlords and creditors. However, she never wavered in her faith and boundless trust in Marx; she was always Marx's closest comrade and wife.
    Jenny was born into the German aristocracy, the daughter of a count. However, she bravely betrayed her class. With Marx's help, Jenny quickly became a materialist and a fighter in the workers' movement. During long periods of underground struggle, she became an excellent propagandist. She always supported Marx, doing much work for him, even sacrificing herself by sharing the burden of tedious housework. As Engels said, "If ever there was a woman who regarded making others happy as her own greatest happiness, it was she." This is a very educational little book.

    燕妮·马克思
    燕妮·马克思和马克思共同生活的一生，不知经历了多少生活上的熬煎，他们夫妇俩把有限的钱财全用在工人运动事业上了。贫穷和流亡生活，使她失去了自己三个可爱的孩子，她一生中习惯了跑当铺、卖家具、到处求借和向房东、债主们周旋，但是她却从来没有动摇过自己的信仰和对马克思的无限信任，她始终是马克思最亲密的同志和妻子。
    燕妮出身德国贵族，是位伯爵的小姐，然而她勇敢地背叛了她的阶级，在马克思的帮助下，燕妮很快地成为一个唯物主义者，一个工人运动的战士。在长久的地下活动斗争中，她成了一个出色的宣传者。她永远支持马克思，为他做了许多工作，甚至牺牲自己，分担了繁琐的家务劳动。正像恩格斯说的：“如果曾有一个女性把使别人幸福视为她自己最高的幸福，那就是她。”这是一本很有教育意义的小书。
