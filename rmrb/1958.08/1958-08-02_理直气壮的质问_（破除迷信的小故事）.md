    Righteous and Confident Questioning
    (A Little Story of Breaking Superstition)
    In the tool reform movement, workers at the Tieye (Iron Industry) Cooperative in Dongguang County, Hebei Province, used a four-foot lathe to manufacture a six-foot lathe. This initiative broke the old regulation in lathe manufacturing that a four-foot lathe must be made with a six-foot lathe, and only an eight-foot lathe could make a six-foot lathe.
    However, a debate arose before manufacturing began. As soon as they started, some people brought out the old regulations from above to oppose it. However, those advocating for the manufacturing righteously and confidently questioned the opponents, "Did machines first have small ones or big ones? What size lathe was used to manufacture the very first eight-foot lathe?" The opponents were left speechless. In this way, the workers believed that all machines and tools are controlled by people, and that people are the masters of tools, overcoming the superstitious thinking of following old regulations and boldly creating.

    理直气壮的质问
    （破除迷信的小故事）
    河北省东光县铁业社的工人，在工具改革运动中曾用四尺的车床制造了一部六尺的车床。这个创举打破了车床制造中四尺车床必须用六尺车床制造，只有八尺的车床才能制造六尺车床的旧规程。
    但在制造前曾经发生过一场争论。一开始制造就有人搬出上面的老规矩来反对。但是，主张制造的人理直气壮地质问反对者道，“机器先有小的还是先有大的？最初那部八尺车床是用几尺的车床制造的？”问得反对者无话可说。这样，工人们才相信一切机器和工具都是受人指挥的，人才是工具的主人，克服了因循陈旧规程的迷信思想，大胆动手创造。
