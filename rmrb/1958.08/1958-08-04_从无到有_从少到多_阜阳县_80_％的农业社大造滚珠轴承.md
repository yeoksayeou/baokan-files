From Nothing to Something, From Few to Many
80% of Agricultural Cooperatives in Fuyang County Vigorously Manufacture Ball Bearings

    (Our report) Anhui Province's Fuyang County has seen a surging and magnificent upsurge in the production of steel ball bearings. Of the county's sixty-five townships, three hundred and thirty-one cooperatives, and ninety-six iron and woodworking cooperatives (factories, groups), fifty-seven townships and two hundred and fifty-two agricultural cooperatives, and all iron and woodworking cooperatives have now learned the indigenous methods of manufacturing ball bearings. They have already produced 238,039 steel balls and 8,824 sets of bearings, enabling 359 improved carts, 65,749 new-style waterwheels, 2,019 horse-drawn waterwheels, 2,053 improved stone mills, and 227 double-wheeled double-shared plows to be fitted with steel ball bearings. Four townships, thirty agricultural cooperatives, and seven hundred and thirty-six production teams have achieved the bearingization of new-style tools.
    After Fuyang County sent people to Jieshou County in early June to learn the experience of manufacturing bearings, it immediately listed the work of manufacturing steel ball bearings as one of the county's main tasks, calling on the entire county to "launch indigenous methods, bloom everywhere, and manufacture steel ball bearings." Now, all districts, townships, and more than 80% of agricultural cooperatives in the county have learned to make ball bearings, basically meeting the requirement that every cooperative makes ball bearings.

    从无到有　从少到多
    阜阳县80％的农业社大造滚珠轴承
    本报讯　安徽省阜阳县出现了汹涌澎湃、波澜壮阔的制造钢珠轴承的生产大高潮。全县六十五个乡，三百三十一个社和九十六个铁木业社（厂、组），到现在已有五十七个乡、二百五十二个农业社，全部铁木业社都学会了制造滚珠轴承的土办法，已生产出钢珠二十三万八千零三十九颗，轴承八千八百二十四套，使三百五十九辆改良大车，六万五千七百四十九部新式水车，二千零一十九辆马拉水车，二千零五十三盘改良石磨和二百二十七部双轮双铧犁安装了钢珠轴承，四个乡三十个农业社、七百三十六个生产队实现了新式工具轴承化。
    阜阳县在6月上旬派人到界首县学习了制轴承的经验后，立即把制钢珠轴承工作列为县的主要工作之一，号召全县“土法上马，遍地开花，制造钢珠轴承”。现在，全县各区、乡和80％以上的农业社都学会了做滚珠轴承，基本上达到社社做滚珠轴承的要求。
