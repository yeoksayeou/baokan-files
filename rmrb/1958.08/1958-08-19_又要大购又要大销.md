　　Both Great Purchase and Great Sales Are Needed
　　Ouyang Chao
    The market is often a mirror. From the market's trends, we can often see the state of production development and the people's living conditions, and also see what society still needs and what work we still need to do. The news of the Hunan autumn rural market survey published in today's newspaper vividly reflects the fruitful results and prosperous scene of the great leap forward in agricultural production, and also raises an important issue to the commercial departments: both great purchase and great sales are needed. Just think: the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries will increase by 1.85 times compared with last year, a large number of agricultural products and sideline products will flood the market, the demand for means of production in rural areas in the second half of this year will increase by 6.78 times compared with the same period last year, and the purchasing power of means of livelihood will also increase by 34% compared with last year. Under such circumstances, how can we meet the needs of the situation without a great purchase and great sales?
    In the great leap forward of commercial work, many commercial departments have examined their production viewpoints, mass viewpoints, and political viewpoints, and prepared ideologically for the great leap forward of commercial work. However, how exactly should commercial work make a great leap forward? Some people think that commercial departments running factories is the great leap forward of commercial work, and is the embodiment of the production viewpoint. In fact, this view is worth considering. It is of course possible for commercial departments to run some factories related to their own business; but the main task of commercial departments is to do a good job in commodity circulation, and promote production by doing a good job in commodity circulation. The great leap forward of commercial work, the production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and political viewpoint of commercial departments should all be reflected in doing a good job in the link of commodity circulation. Under the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, great purchase and great sales are the great leap forward of commercial work, and the embodiment of the production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and political viewpoint of commercial departments.
    If industry is making a great leap forward and agriculture is making a great leap forward, but the commercial departments are not engaging in great purchase and great sales, but in "medium purchase and medium sales" or "small purchase and small sales"; if they are not making every effort to do a good job in commodity circulation, but are relaxing commodity circulation, what will be the result? The result will inevitably affect the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and affect the high-speed advance. The great leap forward of commercial work, the production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and political viewpoint of commercial departments, cannot be separated from doing a good job in commodity circulation, and under the situation of the great leap forward, it is even more impossible to separate from great purchase and great sales.
    The survey of the Hunan autumn rural market shows that great purchase and great sales are urgently needed, and it is hoped that commercial departments will take action quickly.

### 又要大购又要大销

　　又要大购又要大销
　　欧阳超
    市场常常是一面镜子。从市场的动向中往往可以看出生产发展的状况和人民生活的状况，也可以看出社会还需要什么、我们还要做些什么工作。今天本报发表的湖南秋后农村市场调查的新闻，就生动地反映了农业生产大跃进后果实累累、一片欣欣向荣的景象，也向商业部门提出了一个重要的问题：既要大购又要大销。试想：农副业总产值将比去年增长一点八五倍，大批农产品和副业产品涌上市场，今年下半年农村生产资料的需要量将比去年同期增加六点七八倍，生活资料的购买力也将比去年增加34％，在这种情况下，不来个大购大销，怎么能适应形势的需要？
    在商业工作的大跃进中，许多商业部门曾检查了自己的生产观点、群众观点和政治观点，为商业工作的大跃进做好了思想准备。可是，商业工作究竟怎样大跃进呢？有些人以为商业部门办工厂就是商业工作大跃进，就是生产观点的体现。其实，这种看法是很值得考虑的。商业部门办一些和自己业务有关的工厂，当然是可以的；但商业部门的主要任务毕竟是搞好商品流通，通过搞好商品流通来促进生产。商业工作的大跃进，商业部门的生产观点、群众观点和政治观点都应该体现在搞好商品流通这个环节上。在工农业生产大跃进的形势底下，大购大销才是商业工作的大跃进，才是商业部门的生产观点、群众观点和政治观点的体现。
    工业在大跃进，农业在大跃进，如果商业部门不是大购大销，而是“中购中销”或“小购小销”；不是全力搞好商品流通，而是放松了商品流通，结果会怎么样呢？结果必然会影响到工农业生产的大跃进，影响到高速度前进。商业工作的大跃进，商业部门的生产观点、群众观点和政治观点，一点也不能离开搞好商品流通，在大跃进的形势下，更是一点也不能离开大购大销。
    湖南秋后农村市场的调查，说明大购大销迫不容缓，希望商业部门赶快行动起来。
