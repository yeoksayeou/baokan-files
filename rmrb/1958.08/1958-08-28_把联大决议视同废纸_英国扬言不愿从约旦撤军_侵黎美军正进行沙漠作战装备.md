Xinhua News Agency, August 27th Dispatch from Amman: United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld arrived in Amman, the capital of Jordan, today. He stayed overnight in Beirut yesterday en route to Jordan from New York.

Hammarskjöld came to the Middle East to arrange the implementation of the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session, which demanded that the U.S. and British invading forces withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible.

Before Hammarskjöld's arrival in Amman, Western news agencies had ulterior motives in spreading news that the British invading forces authorities and the Jordanian Hussein puppet regime would refuse to implement the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. According to reports, both the British and Jordanian sides emphasized that the British troops "will never" withdraw from Jordan quickly because the United Nations unanimously passed the Arab countries' resolution on the Middle East. It is said that Hussein and Rifai will express to Hammarskjöld that Jordan is "determined to insist" that British troops must remain in Jordan "until Jordan's security is guaranteed against aggression."

Xinhua News Agency Beirut, August 27th Dispatch: According to the Oriental News Agency here, the American troops occupying Lebanon have recently received a large amount of equipment specially used for combat in desert areas. These technical equipment, including tanks and armored vehicles, enable the American troops to quickly pass through desert areas.

According to newspaper reports and eyewitness confirmation, the American invading forces have occupied some new strategic locations in the southwestern suburbs of Beirut.

After the Beirut "Al Anwar" published a leaflet distributed by an American military officer invading Lebanon, exposing the American conspiracy to establish atomic and rocket bases in Lebanon, the American invading forces spokesman hurriedly came out to deny it. However, he did not dare to mention the facts revealed in the leaflet.

On the 26th, the Beirut "Al Anwar" refuted the U.S. military spokesman's denial, saying that the leaflet of the American officer named John Herr still exists in the newspaper office, and the newspaper office is ready to photocopy and publish it when necessary.

According to the "Al Hayat" report, an explosion occurred on the balcony of the Bluebird Cafe in Beirut on the 25th, and twenty American soldiers who were drinking and making merry inside fled in embarrassment.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th Dispatch: TASS Beirut, August 27th Dispatch: The U.S. military command in Lebanon issued an official announcement stating that airborne troops landing exercises will be held at Khaled International Airport starting on August 27th.

The communiqué stated that all U.S. airborne troops stationed in Lebanon will participate in the exercise.

　　把联大决议视同废纸
    英国扬言不愿从约旦撤军
    侵黎美军正进行沙漠作战装备
    新华社27日讯　安曼消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德今天到达约旦首都安曼。他在从纽约来约旦途中，昨天在贝鲁特住了一夜。
    哈马舍尔德是在联合国大会紧急特别会议通过了关于要求美英侵略军队早日从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出的决议后，来中东安排执行这项决议的。
    在哈马舍尔德到达安曼之前，西方通讯社别有用心地传出消息说，英国侵略军当局和约旦侯赛因傀儡政权都将拒绝执行联合国大会的这项决议。据报道，英国和约旦方面都强调表示，英国军队“决不会”由于联合国一致通过了阿拉伯国家关于中东的决议而很快撤出约旦。据说，侯赛因和里法伊都将向哈马舍尔德表示，约旦“决心坚持”英国军队必须留在约旦，“直到约旦的安全得到免遭侵略的保证时止”。
    新华社贝鲁特27日电　据此间东方通讯社报道，侵占黎巴嫩的美国军队新近得到了大量专门在沙漠地区作战使用的装备。这些包括坦克、装甲车在内的许多技术装备能够使美国军队迅速通过沙漠地区。
    据报纸报道和目击者的证实，美国侵略军又在贝鲁特西南郊占领了一些新的战略地点。
    在贝鲁特“晚报”发表了由一名侵黎美军军官散发的揭露美国阴谋在黎巴嫩建立原子基地和火箭基地的传单以后，美国侵略军发言人慌忙出来否认。但是他没有敢提及传单中所透露的事实。
    26日，贝鲁特“晚报”驳斥美军发言人的抵赖说，署名约翰·赫的美国军官的这份传单还存在报馆里，报馆准备在必要时把它影印发表。
    据“明星日报”报道，25日在贝鲁特的青鸟咖啡馆的阳台上发生了爆炸，在里面酗酒作乐的二十名美军士兵狼狈逃出。
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特27日讯：黎巴嫩美军司令部发表正式公告说，8月27日起在哈勒德国际机场上举行空降部队降陆演习。
    公报说，美国驻黎巴嫩空降部队将全部参加演习。
