    This Newspaper Receives a Large Number of Readers' Letters
    Unanimously Supporting the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué

    This newspaper reports: After the publication of the communiqué of the talks between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev, this newspaper has continuously received letters from a broad readership, warmly supporting the communiqué. These letters, coming from different work positions, are filled with a common desire and determination: to warn the imperialist elements to immediately cease their wars of aggression; and to be ready at any time to contribute all their strength to defend peace.

    Li Mingyun, a young worker from the North China Radio Equipment Factory, said: We are the working class of China, we want peace, not war. If the imperialist elements dare to provoke war, we will certainly wipe them off the face of the earth. He firmly stated: We will overfulfill the August production target and use practical actions to strike a painful blow to the imperialist elements. A letter from the entire student body of the Department of Political Economy at Nankai University in Tianjin stated: The communiqué is a force and guarantee for defending peace and stopping war, encouraging them to better transform themselves and strive to become both red and expert as soon as possible. The entire student body of the Exploration Engineering Department of the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, who are working hard on designing iron smelting furnaces and machinery, warned the imperialist elements that if they dare to impose war on the people of the world, they will use the molten iron they smelt to completely eliminate the imperialist warmongers. The members of the Communist Youth League of Beijing Experimental Middle School, who are holding a meeting to rectify the League, expressed their desire to unite closely around the Party, listen to the Party, thoroughly examine their thoughts, firmly establish a proletarian stance, and dedicate their strength to world peace at any time. Representatives from more than ten provinces, including Hubei, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Anhui, who are in Beijing reporting on flood control work, angrily condemned the imperialist elements' aggressive actions in the Middle East in their letters, and warned the American and British imperialists to immediately stop the war of aggression and honestly convene a summit conference of great powers to discuss the Middle East situation. They also guaranteed to exert their utmost efforts to do a good job in flood and drought prevention and strive for a great leap forward in national agricultural production. All the representatives attending the First National Quyi Performance in Beijing expressed that as socialist literary and art fighters, they must quickly reflect real life, closely cooperate with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, give play to the role of Quyi as vanguards, use literary and artistic weapons to support the just struggle of the Arab people, and give the warmongers a merciless blow. In order to eliminate the aggressors and defend world peace, they will contribute all their strength.
