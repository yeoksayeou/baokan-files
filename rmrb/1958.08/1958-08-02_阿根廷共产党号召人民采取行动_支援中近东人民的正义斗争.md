Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, August 1st: According to a report in the Argentinian "Times" on July 17th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina issued a statement on July 16th, calling on the Argentinian people to take action to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East. The statement pointed out that the new and disgraceful fact of the vicious aggression against the Lebanese people launched by U.S. imperialism once again proves that U.S. imperialism has now become the brutal gendarme dealing with the people of all countries who love freedom and national independence.

The statement said, "Any government that relies on the will of the people cannot support the aggressive policies of the United States in the United Nations, but should condemn this policy and support the lofty position of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist peace camp, demanding that the occupying forces immediately withdraw from Lebanon and other Arab countries.

The statement said, "The imperialist powers, which are in the midst of an economic crisis, want to find a way out of the crisis through war, especially large-scale destructive atomic war."

The statement then pointed out that "the current events in the Middle East prove that the people of all countries must oppose giving imperialism any concessions, especially concessions in terms of oil and bases. Historical experience proves that with concessions always comes national enslavement, either by supporting brutal dictators or by direct military aggression.

The statement said, "The people of Latin America have long and painful experience in this regard. The mastermind behind the landing of troops in Lebanon is the same person who used to and still instigates coups in Latin America and plots coups in our country. We, the people of Latin America, still clearly remember the living example of Guatemala being enslaved under U.S. aggression, and we also remember the recent U.S. threat to send troops to land in Venezuela under the pretext of avenging insults.

The statement demanded that the Argentine government and parliament also support the invaded people. And it demanded that Argentina's representative to the United Nations firmly oppose the United States' use of this international organization to exonerate it from the crime of invading the Lebanese people, and demand that the occupying forces withdraw immediately!

The statement finally called on the Argentinian people to take swift action and launch mass activities throughout the country to condemn the aggressors and support the Arab people who are heroically fighting for freedom and national independence!

    阿根廷共产党号召人民采取行动
    支援中近东人民的正义斗争
    新华社1日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：据阿根廷“时报”7月17日报道，阿根廷共产党中央委员会7月16日发表声明，号召阿根廷人民行动起来声援中近东人民的正义斗争。声明指出，美帝国主义所发动的对黎巴嫩人民的凶恶的侵略这一个新的可耻事实，又一次证明了美国帝国主义在目前成了对付爱好自由和民族独立的各国人民的残暴宪兵。
    声明说，“任何一个依靠人民意志的政府都不能在联合国中支持美国的侵略政策，而是应该谴责这种政策，并且支持苏联和社会主义和平阵营其他国家的崇高立场，要求占领军立刻撤出黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯国家。
    声明说，“正处于经济危机中的帝国主义大国想通过战争、特别是大规模毁灭性的原子战争来找寻危机的出路。”
    声明接着指出，“中东目前的事件证明，各国人民必须反对给帝国主义以任何租让权，特别是石油和基地方面的租让权。历史经验证明，随着租让权而来的总是国家被奴役，其方式或者是支持残酷的独裁者，或者是直接进行军事侵略。
    声明说，“拉丁美洲人民在这方面有着长期的和痛苦的经验。指挥军队在黎巴嫩登陆的幕后人，正是从前和现在在拉丁美洲发动政变，在我国搞政变阴谋的牵线人。我们拉丁美洲人民都还清楚记得危地马拉在美国侵略下受到奴役这一活生生的例子，还记得最近美国借口洗雪污辱又扬言要派军队在委内瑞拉登陆。
    声明要求阿根廷政府和议会也要来支援被侵略的人民。并且要求阿根廷驻联合国的代表要坚决反对美国利用这个国际组织来开脱它侵略黎巴嫩人民的罪责，并且要求占领军立即撤退！
    声明最后号召阿根廷人民迅速行动起来在全国范围内展开群众活动，谴责侵略者，支援英勇地为自由和民族独立而斗争的阿拉伯人民！
