　　Hanoi Farmers Congratulate Hubei Farmers on Early Rice High-Yielding Bumper Harvest
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th. The Executive Committee of the Hanoi Suburban Farmers' Association recently wrote a letter on behalf of 160,000 farmers in the Hanoi suburbs to the farmers of Hubei Province, China, warmly congratulating them on creating a great achievement in high-yielding early rice production.
    The letter said: We are very pleased to learn that in China's socialist Great Leap Forward movement, the yield of early rice in Hubei Province has been continuously increasing. Recently, the Jian Guo No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Macheng County, Hubei, created a high-yield record of 36,956 jin per mu in an experimental field.
    The letter said that we regard your victory as our own victory, and we will vigorously launch a production competition movement to increase the unit area yield from 1,900 kilograms per hectare last year to 2,500 kilograms per hectare, and strive for a bumper harvest of late rice this year. (Note: one hectare equals fifteen mu, one kilogram equals two market jin)

　　中越人民的共同喜悦
　　河内农民贺湖北农民早稻高额丰产
    新华社河内19日电  河内市郊农会执行委员会最近代表河内郊区十六万农民写信给中国湖北省农民，热烈祝贺他们创造早稻高额丰产的巨大成就。
    信中说，我们非常愉快地获悉，在中国的社会主义大跃进运动中，湖北省的早稻产量不断增加，最近，在湖北麻城县建国第一农业社的一块试验田中创造了每市亩三万六千九百五十六斤的丰产纪录。
    信里说，我们把你们的胜利看作是自己的胜利，我们将大力展开生产竞赛运动，把去年每公顷一千九百公斤的单位面积产量提高到每公顷二千五百公斤，争取今年晚稻丰收。（按：一公顷合十五亩，一公斤合二市斤）
