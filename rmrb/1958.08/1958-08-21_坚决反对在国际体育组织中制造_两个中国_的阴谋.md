　　Resolutely Oppose the Conspiracy to Create "Two Chinas" in International Sports Organizations
    The Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) issued a statement the day before yesterday regarding its severance of relations with the International Olympic Committee, strongly condemning the International Olympic Committee for engaging in the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" under the manipulation of its American President, Avery Brundage. The Chinese Olympic Committee officially declared that it no longer recognizes the International Olympic Committee and is severing all ties with it. The person in charge of the All-China Sports Federation also firmly stated at a press conference that the Chinese Olympic Committee cannot tolerate the conspiracy of using international sports organizations to create "Two Chinas" and has decided to withdraw from eight international sports organizations, including the International Amateur Swimming Federation. At the same time, International Olympic Committee member Dong Shouyi wrote to Brundage, refusing to cooperate with him and refusing to have contact with the International Olympic Committee under his control. The solemn protest and statement of the Chinese Olympic Committee once again expressed the firm will and solemn position of the Chinese people in resolutely opposing the American conspiracy to create "Two Chinas."
    The charter of the International Olympic Committee stipulates that only one Olympic committee is recognized in a country, which is responsible for developing amateur sports in its own country, maintaining the Olympic ideal, and is not subject to any political, religious, or commercial influences. Only it can send athletes to participate in the Olympic Games. The Chinese Olympic Committee has led the people of China in launching sports activities in the past few years. Whether in terms of the breadth of participation, the improvement of sports standards, the construction of venues and the manufacture of equipment, scientific research and education and training, there have been rapid developments and amazing achievements. It is already the only legitimate sports organization in China recognized by the world, and it has already gained legal status at the 49th session of the International Olympic Committee in 1954. However, the American imperialist Brundage has manipulated the International Olympic Committee to illegally include the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group in the list recognized by the International Olympic Committee in addition to recognizing the only legitimate Olympic Committee of China – the All-China Sports Federation. This blatant violation of the principles of the International Olympic Committee's charter cannot but arouse great indignation and resolute protests from the Chinese sports community and the Chinese people.
    The American imperialist Brundage has always claimed "no politics," but in his letter to Dong Shouyi, the Chinese member of the International Olympic Committee, he nonsensically stated that "there is a separate government in Taiwan," which is exactly the nonsense that the US State Department has repeated thousands of times. Recently, in its so-called "Memorandum on the Policy of Non-Recognition of the Chinese Communist Party," the US State Department nonsensically stated that the "legitimate Chinese government still exists" in Taiwan. Facts have proved that Brundage is just a parrot on the shelf of the US State Department. The shameless deeds he has done in manipulating the International Olympic Committee are part of the American conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. There is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. Premier Zhou Enlai of our State Council has long solemnly pointed out: "The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create 'Two Chinas.' No matter in what occasion or in what way this conspiracy appears, we will never allow this conspiracy to succeed." Similarly, the Chinese people will never allow the American imperialist Brundage to manipulate the International Olympic Committee to succeed in the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas"!
    Although the Chinese Olympic Committee does not recognize the International Olympic Committee manipulated by Brundage and has severed all ties with it, the sports undertakings of the Chinese people are advancing rapidly, and the Chinese sports community has established extensive ties with the sports communities of various countries. The Chinese sports community has friends all over the world. In the future, we will continue to strive to develop domestic mass sports activities and further strengthen the ties between the Chinese sports community and the sports communities of various countries and friendly cooperation in international sports activities. At the same time, we firmly believe that the solemn position of the Chinese Olympic Committee will surely be supported by fair-minded people in the sports communities of various countries and fair-minded members in the International Olympic Committee. The Chinese Olympic Committee will work with friends in the sports communities of various countries to strive to maintain the lofty ideals of the Olympics.

### 坚决反对在国际体育组织中制造“两个中国”的阴谋

　　坚决反对在国际体育组织中制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）前天发表了关于同国际奥林匹克委员会断绝关系的声明，严正谴责国际奥林匹克委员会在它的美国主席布伦代奇的操纵下，制造“两个中国”的阴谋。中国奥林匹克委员会正式宣告不再承认国际奥林匹克委员会，并且同它断绝一切关系。中华全国体育总会负责人在记者招待会上也坚决表示中国奥林匹克委员会不能容忍利用国际体育组织制造“两个中国”的阴谋，决定退出国际业余游泳联合会等八个国际体育组织。与此同时，国际奥林匹克委员会委员董守义，写信给布伦代奇，拒绝同他合作，拒绝同在他操纵下的国际奥林匹克委员会发生联系。中国奥林匹克委员会的严正抗议和声明，再一次表达了中国人民坚决反对美国阴谋制造“两个中国”的坚强意志和严正立场。
    国际奥林匹克委员会宪章规定：在一个国家只承认一个奥林匹克委员会，由它负责发展本国的业余体育运动，维护奥林匹克的理想，并且不受任何政治、宗教或商业的影响，也只有它才能派遣运动员参加奥林匹克运动会。中国奥林匹克委员会在过去几年中，领导全中国人民展开体育运动，无论在参加人数的广泛、体育水平的提高、场地的建筑和器材的制造、科学研究和教育训练等方面都有飞跃的发展和惊人的成绩。它已经是世界公认的中国唯一合法的体育组织，而且已经在1954年国际奥林匹克委员会第四十九届会议上取得合法地位。然而，美帝国主义分子布伦代奇却操纵国际奥林匹克委员会，在承认了中国唯一合法的奥林匹克委员会——中华全国体育总会以外，又非法地将台湾蒋介石集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”列入国际奥林匹克委员会承认的名单中。这种粗暴地破坏了国际奥林匹克委员会宪章的原则，不能不引起中国体育界和中国人民的极大愤慨和坚决的抗议。
    美帝国主义分子布伦代奇一向标榜“不谈政治”，可是在他给国际奥林匹克委员会的中国委员董守义的信中，却胡说什么“台湾存在着一个单独的政府”之类的谰言，这正是美国国务院说了千百遍的谰言。最近美国国务院在它公布的所谓“关于不承认中国共产党政策的备忘录”中，就胡说什么台湾“合法的中国政府还继续存在”。事实证明，布伦代奇正是美国国务院架子上的鹦鹉，他操纵国际奥林匹克委员会所做的无耻的勾当，正是美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋的一部分。台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，中国人民一定要解放台湾。中国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国。我国国务院总理周恩来早就严正指出：“中国政府和中国人民坚决反对制造‘两个中国’的阴谋。不管这个阴谋在什么场合，以什么方式出现，我们绝不容许这个阴谋得逞。”同样地，中国人民也决不容许美帝国主义分子布伦代奇操纵国际奥林匹克委员会制造“两个中国”的阴谋得逞！
    中国奥林匹克委员会虽然不承认为布伦代奇所操纵的国际奥林匹克委员会，并且同它断绝一切关系。但是中国人民的体育事业突飞猛进，中国体育界同各国体育界已经建立了广泛的联系，中国体育界的朋友遍天下。今后，我们仍将努力发展国内的群众体育运动，并且进一步加强中国体育界同各国体育界的联系和在国际体育活动中的友好合作。同时，我们深信，中国奥林匹克委员会的严正立场，一定会得到各国体育界的公正人士和国际奥林匹克委员会中的公正的委员们的支持。中国奥林匹克委员会将同各国体育界的朋友们一起，为维护奥林匹克的崇高理想而努力。
