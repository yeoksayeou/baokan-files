　　Notes
    An Irony
    The United States Information Service has always been regarded as one of the mouthpieces of the U.S. State Department. However, contrary to the U.S. State Department's attitude of adamantly refusing to recognize China in its memorandum, the USIS has recently been collecting voluminous reports on American public opinion regarding China.

    In its summary of reports on reactions to China, the USIS cannot but admit that some American newspapers have expressed various complaints, doubts, and worries about Dulles's "inflexible" and "lamentable" die-hard policy, even though these opinions are also bourgeois opinions. For example, the "New York Post" accused the memorandum of "substituting assumptions for facts"; the "Detroit Free Press" said that China "is not a country that can be ignored," and so on.

    The Chinese people have long said: We build our country according to our own will and are not at all interested in whether the United States recognizes us or not. However, the release of the American memorandum has caused an uproar in their own country, which, in the words of that "strangely blind" memorandum, is truly an "ironic" phenomenon.

    Not a Fable

    The London "Times" has offered a new explanation for the presence of the U.S. Marines and warships in Singapore: it is to "show strength" to China. Now, it is becoming increasingly clear that the so-called U.S. military's arrival in Singapore for "rest and recreation" is a complete lie. Britain's provision of Singapore to the U.S. military as a base is the first taste of the "strength" of the United States.

    This is truly like a new fable: the fox and the eagle become friends, and in order to consolidate their friendship by living together, the eagle builds its nest on a large tree next to the fox's den. The fox goes out and brags that it has a powerful friend, but when it returns, it finds that the eagle has snatched its children and eaten them. This may not be a fable; it is actually modern history in the 1950s!

　　札记
    一个讽刺
    美国新闻处一向被认为是美国国务院的喉舌之一。可是同美国国务院发表的死不承认中国的备忘录的态度相反，美国新闻处最近却连篇累牍地搜集起美国舆论关于中国的反应来了。
    美国新闻处在它综述有关中国的反应的报道中，不能不承认，美国某些报纸对于杜勒斯的“不灵活的”“可悲的”死硬政策，发出了各种抱怨、怀疑和忧虑，虽然这些舆论也都是资产阶级舆论。例如，“纽约邮报”指责说：备忘录是用“假设代替事实”；“底特律自由报”说，中国“不是一个可以忽视的国家”等等。
    中国人民早就说过：我们根据自己的意志建设自己的国家，对于美国的承认与否丝毫也不感到兴趣。而美国的备忘录一出，却在他们国内引起一片乱喳喳，用那篇“盲目到令人奇怪”的备忘录的话来说，这真是一个“具有“讽刺意味”的现象。
    不是寓言
    伦敦“泰晤士报”对美国海军陆战队和军舰驻在新加坡，提出了一个新的解释：这是为了向中国“显示实力”。现在，人们越来清些地可以看到，所谓美军开到新加坡是“休息和娱乐”完全是一片谎言。英国把新加坡提供给美军作基地，倒是首先尝到了美国“实力”的滋味。
    这真像一篇新的寓言：狐狸和鹰结交，为了同住一处使得交情巩固，鹰就在狐狸窝旁的一棵大树上筑起巢来。狐狸出去吹嘘它有了一个强大的朋友，可是回来一看，鹰却抢走了它的儿女，把它们吃掉了。这也许不是什么寓言，竟是二十世纪五十年代的现代史哩！
