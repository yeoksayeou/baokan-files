In the great tide of world people demanding an immediate halt to the US-British aggression in the Middle East, the United Nations General Assembly began an emergency special session on the 13th to discuss the Middle East situation. Because US-British troops continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, threatening peace in the Middle East and the world, people of all countries are watching the progress of the UN General Assembly's emergency special session, and eagerly expect this meeting to take measures to eliminate the tensions caused by the US-British invasion of the Middle East.

The meeting has been going on for three days. Representatives of many countries have spoken at the meeting one after another. Representatives of the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, and Czechoslovakia all emphasized that the immediate withdrawal of US-British troops from Lebanon and Jordan is the primary task at present. The Soviet Union submitted a proposal to the General Assembly for the immediate withdrawal of US-British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. This is entirely in line with the deep desire of people all over the world for peace. However, the US-British aggressors at the meeting tried their best to avoid discussing the withdrawal of troops, and insisted on their policy of invading the Middle East. This stubborn attitude of the US-British aggressors was once again blatantly demonstrated in the speech delivered by US President Eisenhower to the UN General Assembly emergency special session on the 13th. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd completely echoed Eisenhower's remarks. This situation shows that the US-British aggressors are still unwilling to turn back after their aggression and plans to expand the war have been frustrated, and they seem to be determined to "not shed a tear until they see the coffin."

Eisenhower's speech on the 13th, like the speech he delivered on July 15 for the US military's landing in Lebanon, was a very vicious speech against the people of the Middle East and the people of the world. In this speech, Eisenhower put forward a so-called "Near East Peace Plan" including six points, and this plan, under the guise of "peace," is actually the American plan to invade the Middle East.

The first point of Eisenhower's six-point plan is "United Nations concern for Lebanon." How should the United Nations "care" for Lebanon? According to Eisenhower, it is necessary for the United Nations to "ensure that Lebanon continues to maintain its independence and integrity" according to the US plan, and only when the United Nations does this will the US troops occupying Lebanon be willing to withdraw. People can't help but ask: Who is it that has infringed upon Lebanon? Eisenhower tried his best to make it seem as if Lebanon was suffering from "the threat of a civil war instigated from the outside"; but this kind of slander by the aggressors has long been bankrupt. The two reports of the United Nations observer group sent to Lebanon have fully proved that the so-called civil war in Lebanon being "instigated from the outside" is a complete fabrication. The facts prove precisely that it is none other than the American aggressors who set aside the United Nations and sent troops to occupy Lebanon who are infringing upon the independence and integrity of Lebanon. If we really want to care about Lebanon and respect the United Nations, then the only way is for the United States to immediately withdraw its invading troops from Lebanon. However, Eisenhower wants the United Nations to take on the task of replacing US troops in occupying Lebanon before he is willing to withdraw his troops. This is actually to allow the US aggressors to continue to occupy Lebanon under the shield of the United Nations, and continue to trample on the basic principles of the United Nations Charter. This is not "concern for Lebanon" at all, but a blatant attack on the dignity of the United Nations Charter and the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon!

Let's look at what Eisenhower's second point is. This is to take a so-called "United Nations measures to maintain peace in Jordan." If there is still a civil war in Lebanon against the Chamoun group, then in Jordan, even this excuse does not exist for the aggressors. However, Eisenhower fabricated out of thin air, saying that "methods of indirect aggression that can be detected in Jordan may lead to conflicts that endanger peace," so he shouted and shouted that the United Nations should take action in Jordan. Here, Eisenhower did not explain what he meant by "indirect aggression," but people know that in his speech on July 15, he falsely accused the revolution in Iraq as "indirect aggression" against Iraq. This is an absurd excuse. The US aggressors later had to slap themselves in the face and recognize the government of the Republic of Iraq, which proves the true intention of the likes of Eisenhower is nothing more than to use the so-called "indirect aggression" as a pretext to carry out its large-scale direct aggression against the Middle East, and attempt to extinguish the flames of the Iraqi people's revolution. It was under this pretext that the British aggressors occupied Jordan. But now Eisenhower wants the United Nations to "maintain" peace in Jordan, which, like his call for the United Nations to "care" for Lebanon, aims to continue to maintain imperialist control over Jordan under the shield of the United Nations. Therefore, Eisenhower's so-called "United Nations measures to maintain peace in Jordan" is actually a step for US-British imperialism to continue to collude with each other to enslave the people of the Middle East. Facts have proved that both indirect and direct aggression are done by US-British imperialism itself.

The third point of Eisenhower's plan is the so-called "stopping externally instigated internal strife." This is the center of Eisenhower's six-point plan, and it is also a foreshadowing for US-British imperialism to continue to suppress the Middle East national independence movement and carry out armed intervention in other countries in the future. In his speech, Eisenhower described the civil war in Lebanon as "instigated from the outside," so the United States "responded" to the "call" of the Chamoun group and sent troops to occupy Lebanon. When talking about this point, the US president, who expressed "unwavering adherence to the principles of the (United Nations) Charter," completely exposed his hideous face. He blatantly said: "The United States reserves the right, within the spirit of the United Nations Charter, to respond to the legitimate calls of any country, especially small countries." In other words, the United States can completely disregard the principles of the United Nations Charter and send troops to occupy any country, especially "small countries" like Lebanon, at will. Obviously, armed intervention in Middle Eastern countries is a major exposure of the true face of the Eisenhower Doctrine. The Eisenhower Doctrine originally carried the banner of "anti-communism," but the US armed intervention in Lebanon could not even use the banner of "anti-communism." The US armed intervention in Lebanon under the pretext of the so-called "threat of internal strife instigated from the outside" actually expanded the Eisenhower Doctrine, from the anti-communist pretext to the pretext of opposing the so-called "internal strife instigated from the outside," so that the United States can carry out crude armed intervention in any other country without limit.

However, the so-called pretext of "internal strife instigated from the outside" has been proven to be an extremely shameless fabrication in the Lebanese incident. US-British imperialism described the national independence movement in Arab countries as "internal strife instigated from the outside," which is a great slander against the Arab people, and also exposed their extreme hatred for Arab nationalism. Eisenhower's talk about "stopping externally instigated internal strife," to put it bluntly, is to continue and expand the Eisenhower Doctrine, which has long been bankrupt, to suppress the national independence movements of the Arab people and the people of other countries.

The fourth point of Eisenhower's plan is to organize a so-called "United Nations Peace Force." In his speech, Eisenhower insisted that what happened in Lebanon and Jordan showed that the United Nations needed such a force. Why is that? Is it really, as Eisenhower said, so that the United Nations can "take effective action immediately to help them defend their independence"? Of course not. People know that the excuse for the US-British aggressors to carry out armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan was to help these two countries "maintain independence." In the vocabulary of the American aggressors, "helping other countries maintain independence" has become synonymous with "armed interference in other countries' internal affairs." Therefore, Eisenhower's true intention in advocating the establishment of a United Nations force is to put the US-British troops invading the Middle East under the flag of the United Nations, so that they can obtain an open and legal status and become world police to suppress the national independence movements of the Middle Eastern people and the people of other countries. Isn't this obvious? Eisenhower's sinister plot is absolutely intolerable to any country that truly upholds the United Nations Charter.

In his speech, Eisenhower described the US aggression against Iran, Greece, Turkey, Berlin, Korea, and our territory of Taiwan after World War II as the US's "respect for the freedom of all countries and people," and as the US's opposition to "direct or indirect aggression." This not only clearly shows that Eisenhower's purpose in needing a United Nations force is to carry out armed intervention and aggression against the people of all countries under the banner of the United Nations, just as the US has done and is doing in Iran, Turkey, Berlin, Korea, and Taiwan; at the same time, this more clearly shows that the United States has consistently interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, undermined the freedom of the people of other countries, and suppressed national independence movements under the guise of so-called "respect for the freedom of other people," etc. People should regard the true meaning of Eisenhower's speech in this way.

The fifth point of Eisenhower's plan is to engage in a so-called "regional economic development plan aimed at helping to accelerate the improvement of the living standards of the people of these Arab countries"; the sixth point is to "take steps to prevent a new spiral of arms race from occurring in this region." At a time when US-British troops continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan and threaten the security of other Arab countries, the US president's talk about the economic development of Arab countries and the cessation of the arms race in the region is extremely hypocritical. Eisenhower's purpose is nothing more than to divert people's attention in order to divert the attention of people of all countries from demanding the withdrawal of US-British troops from the Middle East. However, this attempt is futile. The people of the Middle East have long tasted the taste of imperialist aggression and exploitation, and they deeply know that they will live better without the "help" and "care" of imperialism. In commenting on Eisenhower's "economic development plan," the Cairo "Al-Ahram" pointed out sharply: "The Middle East has never complained about its economic conditions, but has been constantly complaining about successive aggressions and the exploitation of local resources in the Middle East by certain countries. If these countries stop, then there is no need for any economic development program, nor any other program from Eisenhower or any other leader." This passage forcefully expresses the anger and contempt of the Middle Eastern people for Eisenhower's "economic development plan."

Eisenhower's six-point plan is the new plan of US imperialism to invade the Middle East after the failure of the Eisenhower Doctrine. The people of the Middle East and the people of the world cannot allow US-British imperialism to promote their aggressive policies under new signs. The people of the Middle East and the peace-loving people of all countries firmly oppose Eisenhower's six-point plan and demand the immediate withdrawal of US-British troops from the Middle East.

The Soviet Union's proposal at the UN General Assembly emergency special session on the immediate withdrawal of US-British troops from Lebanon and Jordan is a practical and effective way to restore peace in the Middle East and eliminate the tensions caused by US-British aggression. United Arab Republic Foreign Minister Fawzi expressed his support for the Soviet proposal at the UN General Assembly emergency special session and believes that this proposal is fully worthy of serious consideration. Fawzi's attitude reflects the deep desire of the Middle Eastern countries and the Middle Eastern people who are threatened by the military force of the US-British aggressors. We, the Chinese people, together with the people of the Middle East and the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely support the Soviet proposal. The prerequisite for resolving the tense situation in the Middle East is the immediate and complete withdrawal of the US-British invading troops. Only by taking measures to promote the withdrawal of US-British troops from Lebanon and Jordan can the United Nations Organization stabilize the situation in the Middle East and consolidate world peace.

The people of all countries demand that the US-British troops withdraw from the Middle East, and the struggle of the people of all countries will not stop until this demand is realized. The peace forces of the people of the world are growing stronger day by day, and they are fully capable of defending world peace and defeating aggressive forces. No matter how Eisenhowerism is dressed up, the people of the Middle East and the people of the world will see through its aggressive nature and will surely bury it resolutely!

### 反对美国侵略中东的新阴谋

　　反对美国侵略中东的新阴谋
    在全世界人民要求立即制止美英侵略中东的巨大浪潮中，联合国大会于13日开始举行紧急特别会议，讨论中东局势问题。由于美英军队还继续侵占着黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁着中东和世界的和平，因而各国人民都注视着联大紧急特别会议的进程，迫切地期望这个会议能够采取措施，来消除由于美英侵略中东而造成的紧张局势。
    会议已经进行三天了。许多国家的代表先后在会议上发言。苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、捷克斯洛伐克的代表都强调使美英军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，是当前的首要任务。苏联向大会提出了建议美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案。这是完全符合全世界人民要求和平的深切愿望的。可是，美英侵略者在会议上却竭力回避讨论撤军问题，并且还坚持它们侵略中东的政策。美英侵略者的这种死硬的态度，在美国总统艾森豪威尔13日向联大紧急特别会议发表的演说中又一次露骨地表现出来。英国外交大臣劳埃德完全附和艾森豪威尔的论调。这种情形表明，美英侵略者在他们的侵略行动和扩大战争的计划遭到挫折以后仍然不肯回头，大有“不见棺材不下泪”的神气。
    艾森豪威尔13日的演说，同他在7月15日为美军登陆黎巴嫩而发表的那篇演说一样，是一篇对中东人民和全世界人民十分凶恶的演说。在这篇演说里，艾森豪威尔提出了一个包括六点的所谓“近东和平计划”，而在“和平”这个字眼掩盖下的这个计划，实际上就是美国侵略中东的计划。
    艾森豪威尔六点计划的第一点是要“联合国对黎巴嫩的关心”。联合国应当怎样“关心”黎巴嫩呢？按照艾森豪威尔的说法，就是要联合国按照美国的计划来“保证黎巴嫩继续保持独立和完整”，并且只有联合国这样做了，美国侵占黎巴嫩的军队才肯撤退。人们不禁要问：究竟谁侵害了黎巴嫩呢？艾森豪威尔竭力想把事情说成好像黎巴嫩遭受着由“外部煽动起来的内战的威胁”；可是侵略者的这种谰言早就破产了。派到黎巴嫩的联合国观察团的两次报告已完全证明，所谓黎巴嫩的内战是“外部煽动起来的”这种说法是彻头彻尾的捏造。事实恰恰证明，侵害黎巴嫩独立和完整的不是别人，正是撇开联合国而派遣军队侵占了黎巴嫩的美国侵略者。如果真的要关心黎巴嫩和尊重联合国的话，那么，唯一的办法就是要美国立即从黎巴嫩撤出他的侵略军队。但是，艾森豪威尔却要联合国承担起替代美国军队侵占黎巴嫩的任务之后，才肯撤军。这实际上就是要使美国侵略者在联合国的盾牌下，继续侵占黎巴嫩，继续践踏联合国宪章的基本原则。这完全不是什么“对黎巴嫩的关心”，而明明是对联合国宪章的尊严和对黎巴嫩独立和主权的猖狂进攻！
    再看艾森豪威尔计划的第二点是什么东西吧。这就是要采取一个所谓“联合国维护约旦的和平的措施”。如果说，在黎巴嫩还有反对夏蒙集团的内战的话，在约旦对于侵略者来说，就连这个借口也不存在了。可是，艾森豪威尔却又凭空捏造，说什么“在约旦可以察觉到的间接侵略的方法可能导致危及和平的冲突”，于是他大喊大叫，要联合国在约旦采取行动。在这里，艾森豪威尔没有说明他所谓的“间接侵略”究竟是怎么回事，但是，人们知道，他在7月15日的演说中曾把伊拉克的革命诬指为是对伊拉克的“间接侵略”。这是荒唐透顶的借口。美国侵略者在后来不得不自打耳光，承认了伊拉克共和国政府，这就证明了艾森豪威尔之流的真意所在，无非是以所谓“间接侵略”为口实而进行它对中东的大规模的直接侵略，并且企图扑灭伊拉克人民革命的火焰。英国侵略者就是在这种借口下侵占了约旦的。可是，现在艾森豪威尔又要联合国“维护”约旦和平，这同他要联合国“关心”黎巴嫩一样，其目的是要在联合国的盾牌下继续保持帝国主义对约旦的控制。因而，艾森豪威尔提出的所谓“联合国维护约旦的和平的措施”，实际上乃是美英帝国主义继续相互勾结来奴役中东人民的一个步骤。事实证明，无论间接侵略或直接侵略都是美英帝国主义自己干的。
    艾森豪威尔计划的第三点是所谓“停止外部煽动的内争”。这是艾森豪威尔六点计划的中心，并且也是为了替美英帝国主义今后继续镇压中东民族独立运动和对其他国家实行武装干涉设下的伏笔。艾森豪威尔在他的演说中把黎巴嫩的内战就说成是“外部煽动起来的”，因而美国就“响应”了夏蒙集团的“呼吁”，派兵侵占黎巴嫩。这位口口声声表示“坚持不渝地遵守（联合国）宪章原则”的美国总统，在谈到这一点的时候，他的狰狞面目就完全暴露出来了。他公然说：“美国在联合国宪章精神内保留了响应任何国家特别是小国的合法呼吁的权利”。换句话说，美国可以根本不顾联合国宪章的原则，可以随意派兵侵占任何国家特别是像黎巴嫩这样的“小国”。显然，对中东国家实行武装干涉，这是艾森豪威尔主义真面目的大暴露。艾森豪威尔主义本来打着“反共”的幌子，而美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉却连“反共”的幌子也无法应用了。美国在所谓“由外部煽动的内战的威胁”的借口下对黎巴嫩进行的武装干涉，实际上是把艾森豪威尔主义扩大了，从反共的借口，扩大成为所谓反对“从外部煽动的内争”的借口，这样美国就可以毫无止境地对任何其他国家实行粗暴的武装干涉了。
    但是，所谓“从外部煽动的内争”这种借口，在黎巴嫩的事件上已经被证明是极端无耻的捏造。美英帝国主义把阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动说成“外部煽动的内争”，这是对阿拉伯人民极大的污蔑，并且也暴露了他们对阿拉伯民族主义的极端仇视。艾森豪威尔谈论什么“停止外部煽动的内争”，揭穿来说，就是要继续和扩大推行早已破产了的艾森豪威尔主义，来镇压阿拉伯人民和其他国家人民的民族独立运动。
    艾森豪威尔计划的第四点是组织所谓“联合国和平部队”。艾森豪威尔在他的演说中硬说在黎巴嫩和约旦所发生的事情表明联合国需要这样一支部队。这是为什么呢？这难道真的如艾森豪威尔所说的是为了使联合国能够“立即采取有效行动来帮助它们保卫独立”吗？当然不是这么一回事。人们知道，美英侵略者武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的借口就是帮助这两个国家“维持独立”。在美国侵略者的词典中，“帮助别国维持独立”已经变成是“武装干涉别国内政”的同义语了。因此，艾森豪威尔主张要建立联合国部队的真正用意，就是使美英侵略中东的军队挂上联合国的旗子，以便它们取得公开合法的地位，成为镇压中东人民和其他各国人民民族独立运动的世界警察。这难道还不明显吗？艾森豪威尔的这种罪恶图谋是任何真正维护联合国宪章的国家所绝对不能容忍的。
    艾森豪威尔在他的演说中，把美国在二次世界大战后对伊朗、希腊、土耳其、柏林、朝鲜以及我国领土台湾的侵略行动，都说成是美国对“一切国家人民的自由的尊重”，是美国反对“直接的或间接侵略”的行为。这不但清楚地说明了，艾森豪威尔需要一支联合国部队的目的，就是要在联合国的旗帜下对各国人民进行武装干涉和侵略，就像美国在伊朗、土耳其、柏林、朝鲜以及台湾干过和正在干的那样；同时这更清楚地说明了美国在所谓“尊重别国人民自由”等等幌子下，一贯地干涉别国的内政，摧残别国人民的自由，镇压民族独立运动。人们对于艾森豪威尔讲话的真谛都应该作如是观。
    艾森豪威尔计划的第五点是搞一个所谓“目的在于帮助加速改善这些阿拉伯国家的人民的生活水平的区域性经济发展计划”；第六点是要“采取步骤防止在这个地区发生新的武装竞赛螺旋”。在美英军队继续侵占着黎巴嫩和约旦，并威胁着其他阿拉伯国家的安全的时候，美国总统对阿拉伯国家的经济发展以及停止这个地区的武装竞赛的谈论，是极端虚伪的。艾森豪威尔的目的无非是想借此来转移人们的视线，以便把各国人民要求美英军队从中东撤退的注意力分散开来。可是，这种企图是枉然的。中东人民早已经尝够了帝国主义侵略和剥削的滋味，他们深深知道，没有帝国主义对他们的“帮助”和“关心”，他们会过得更好。开罗“消息报”在评论艾森豪威尔的“经济发展计划”时就一针见血地指出：“中东从来没有为它的经济条件叫怨，而是一直不断地在埋怨接二连三的侵略和某些国家对中东本地资源的剥削。如果这些国家罢手，那末，就不需要任何经济发展方案，也不需要来自艾森豪威尔或任何其他领袖的其他任何方案。”这一段话极其有力地道出了中东人民对艾森豪威尔的“经济发展计划”的愤怒和鄙视。
    艾森豪威尔的六点计划是在艾森豪威尔主义遭到失败以后，美帝国主义侵略中东的新计划。中东人民和全世界人民都不能容许美英帝国主义在新的招牌下推行它们的侵略政策。中东人民和各国爱好和平人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔的六点计划，要求美英军队立即撤出中东。
    苏联在联大紧急特别会议上提出了关于美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的建议，这个建议是恢复中东和平和消除由美英侵略而造成的紧张局势的切实有效的办法。阿拉伯联合共和国外长法齐在联大紧急特别会议上表示支持苏联的建议，并认为这个建议完全值得认真考虑。法齐的态度反映了遭受美英侵略者武力威胁的中东国家和中东各国人民的深切愿望。我们中国人民同中东人民以及全世界爱好和平人民一道，坚决支持苏联的建议。解决中东紧张局势的先决条件，就是美英侵略军队立即全部撤退。联合国组织只有采取措施，促使美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，才能使中东局势得到稳定，世界和平得到巩固。
    各国人民要求美英军队撤出中东，这个要求一天不实现，各国人民的斗争也一天不会休止。世界人民的和平力量正在日益壮大，他们完全能够保卫世界和平、打败侵略势力。不管艾森豪威尔主义怎样打扮，中东人民和全世界人民都会识破它的侵略本质，一定要坚决地把它埋葬掉！
