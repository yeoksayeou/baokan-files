Who Exactly is Being Stumped?
Zhou Nan

In universities, some professors have resistance towards work-study programs and the integration of education and labor. They believe that work-study programs affect the quality of teaching. Thus, a professor at one college deliberately presented a "difficult problem" from the textbook to stump the students after they had spent a day working. The implication was, "See, you went to do work-study; your learning quality has decreased!"

This professor, with his bourgeois educational ideology, only saw the knowledge in books, but he failed to see the knowledge in productive labor.

We see that work-study programs not only do not lower teaching quality, but actually improve it. Students learn much knowledge in labor that is not found in books. Work-study programs greatly improve students' political thinking, make them understand the greatness of the working people, understand the significance of physical labor, and establish deep feelings with the working people. They can also develop a diligent and thrifty work style. Work-study programs increase students' practical knowledge, cultivate their independent working ability, and improve the learning quality of specialized courses. The Northeast University of Finance and Economics, through socialist cooperation with production departments, oriented itself towards production, enriched teaching content, and significantly improved teaching quality. Not only that, but they also effectively promoted business reforms in production departments and boosted production. Work-study programs improve students' physical health. One college student said during a work-study activity, "Don't be a pale-faced scholar, be a dark-faced iron man!" In short, work-study programs, combining education and productive labor, enable students to establish correct learning attitudes, clarify their learning objectives, and quickly improve the quality of their business studies. Becoming specialized more quickly by being red first is the principle. And if education is separated from labor, separated from practical production, and only focuses on cramming books, it is just like the past Northeast University of Finance and Economics, where some students trained have to start all over again when they get to practical work.

These achievements of the vigorous and thriving work-study programs have not been acknowledged by experts and professors with bourgeois educational ideologies. And how many more problems are there that students learn in labor that are not in books? Students have raised many questions from work-study activities. Let those experts and professors who can talk about rice but not grow it, who can talk about construction but not lay a corner of a wall, answer them! Let's see who is stumping whom!

Teachers at Nanjing Normal College who teach biology don't talk about rice or wheat. Those who teach zoology only talk about lions and tigers, but don't talk about beekeeping or silkworm rearing, or about mosquitoes, flies, and sparrows. Students engaged in productive labor can answer these practical questions, but the teachers cannot. They say that teaching that way is not "systematic" (What kind of "system" is this? It's just a bourgeois educational "system"! We must overthrow these "systems"). A teacher in the Physics Department of Peking University, when conducting a transistor experiment, installed both electrodes on the "+" pole, and couldn't find the problem himself, instead saying that the instrument was broken (Of course, it should be pointed out that he understood the book knowledge in this area). See, are not people whose education is not combined with labor, separated from practical production, stumped by the questions raised in productive labor?

Those professors and experts with bourgeois educational ideologies want to use a few questions from books to stump students, but are stumped by a thousand times more questions from productive labor than from books. Conversely, students may not be able to answer a few "difficult problems" in books, but they can learn from practice how to answer more questions that professors and experts cannot answer. Who should get a score of five? We think it should be the students engaged in productive labor, not the experts and professors who are separated from practical production. Of course, we are not completely denying book knowledge. You should know that only learning book knowledge, not combining it with productive labor, not combining it with workers and peasants, makes that knowledge unreliable.

Currently, work-study programs have entered a new stage, and schools are running factories like a rising wind and surging waves. Haven't some people with bourgeois educational ideologies spoken up again? "Schools running factories is outrageous!" Some even say, "Why bother with work-study programs? If you don't have money, we'll just pay a few more tuition fees." But the workers and peasants are very happy about work-study programs. They say, "The students taught are capable of both writing and fighting, and they have brought the school to their doorstep!" This reflects that implementing work-study programs, combining education and labor, is a struggle between two lines, and also a struggle between the advanced and the backward. We must constantly and universally combine education and labor, and fight against all erroneous ideas that despise labor and look down on the working people, and implement the socialist education policy to the end. At the same time, we should also advise those experts and professors with bourgeois educational ideologies to quickly step out of the "three points form a line" (dormitory—office—classroom) line, and go to productive labor with the students to make up for lessons, being both teachers and students, and train themselves to become true working-class intellectuals, so as not to be stumped by only having book knowledge and not being able to answer practical problems.

    究竟难倒了谁？
    周南
    在高等学校里，有些教授对勤工俭学，教育和劳动结合有抵触情绪。他们认为勤工俭学影响了教学质量。于是有一个学院的一个教授，在学生们进行了一天的劳动以后，竟然故意出了一个书本上的“难题”，来难一难学生。那意思就是，看你们勤工俭学去，学习质量降低了吧！
    这个具有资产阶级教育思想的教授，只看到书本上的学问，可是，他却看不到生产劳动中的学问。
    我们看到，勤工俭学，不仅没有降低教学质量，反而提高了教学质量；学生在劳动中学到了许多书本上没有的学问。勤工俭学使学生在政治思想上得到很大提高，了解到劳动人民的伟大，了解到体力劳动的意义，并同劳动人民建立了深厚的情谊，还能够养成勤俭朴素的作风。勤工俭学增加了学生的实际知识，培养了学生的独立工作能力，提高了专业课的学习质量。东北财经学院通过和生产部门的社会主义大协作，面向生产，丰富了教学内容，显著地提高了教学质量。这还不算，他们还有效地推动了生产部门的业务改革，促进了生产。勤工俭学使学生的身体变好了。一个大学生在勤工俭学活动中说，“不做白面书生，要当黑脸铁汉！”总之，勤工俭学，教育和生产劳动结合，使学生树立了正确的学习态度，明确了学习目的，业务学习质量很快提高。以红带专，专得更快，就是这个道理。而教育如果脱离劳动，脱离生产实际，只顾啃书本，也正如过去东北财经学院一样，培养出来的一些学生，到实际工作中还得从头学起。
    对于这些轰轰烈烈、如火如荼的勤工俭学的成就，具有资产阶级教育思想的专家、教授，并没有加以正视。而学生在劳动中所学到的书本上所没有的题目，又何止千万？学生从勤工俭学的活动中，提出了许多问题，也让那些讲水稻不会种水稻，讲建筑不会砌墙角，诸如此类的专家、教授来回答一下吧！看看究竟谁难倒了谁？
    南京师范学院讲生物学的教师不讲稻子、麦子，讲动物学的只讲狮子、老虎，却不讲养蜂养蚕，不讲蚊、蝇、麻雀。从事生产劳动的学生能回答这些实际问题，可是教师却答不上来，他们却说那样讲课不“系统”（这是什么“系统”呢？不过是资产阶级的教育“系统”罢了！我们要反掉这些“系统”）。北京大学物理系一个教师在作晶体管试验时，把两个电极全安在“＋”极上，自己检查不出来，反而说仪器坏了（当然，应当指明，他在这方面的书本知识是懂得的）。请看，教育不结合劳动，脱离生产实际的人们，在生产劳动中提出的问题面前，不正是难倒了吗？
    那些具有资产阶级教育思想的教授、专家，想拿书本上的几个题目去难学生，而却为生产劳动中千百倍于书本上的题目所难倒。相反地，学生虽然可能回答不出书本上的几个“难题”，可是却能从实践中学会回答那些教授、专家所不能回答的更多的问题。到底是谁该得五分呢？我们看，应该是从事生产劳动的学生，而不是那些脱离生产实际的专家、教授。当然，我们并不是完全否定书本知识。要知道，光学书本知识，不同生产劳动结合，不同工人、农民结合，这种知识是不可靠的。
    目前勤工俭学已经进入了新阶段，学校办工厂如风起云涌。不是又有些具有资产阶级教育思想的人说话了吗？“学校办工厂，太不像话了！”甚至说，“你们何必搞勤工俭学，没有钱，我们多出几个学费就行了。”可是，工人、农民对勤工俭学都高兴得很。他们说，“教出的学生能文能武，把学校办到家门口了！”这就反映出贯彻勤工俭学，教育和劳动结合，是两条路线的斗争，也是先进和落后的斗争。我们一定要经常地普遍地把教育和劳动结合起来，向一切轻视劳动和看不起劳动人民的错误思想作斗争，把社会主义的教育方针贯彻到底。同时，我们也要奉劝那些具有资产阶级教育思想的专家、教授，赶快走出“三点成一线”（宿舍—办公室—教室）的线外来，同学生一起到生产劳动中去补课，边做先生，边做学生，把自己锻炼成为真正的工人阶级知识分子，免得只有书本知识而不能回答实际问题作难。
