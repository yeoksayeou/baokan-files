    Friendship Forged in Beijing
    Zhang Jiong, Student of Peking University

    The tall Aga Abdul Wajim and Liu Chen sat side by side by the car window. The car passed Fuxingmen, flashed past the beige Central Broadcasting Building, and drove on a wide, tree-lined asphalt road.

    Looking at the beautiful scenery of Beijing in summer outside the window, Wajim couldn't help but recall the nostalgic days spent in Beirut: the azure coast, the shimmering shells, the beautiful cedars, the magnificent Borj Square... If it were any other day, he would have enthusiastically described everything about his hometown to his classmates, but today, the beautiful image of Beirut was shattered in his heart: smoke filled the air, American tanks ran over broken walls, and snipers were shooting from behind fortifications...

    The car was full of Peking University students. There were Soviets, Koreans, Czechs, Albanians... An hour ago, they waved their fists, shouted slogans, and walked side by side past the British Chargé d'Affaires office. Now, although everyone was sitting in silence, they had not yet calmed down from the excitement of the demonstration.

    The scorching sun gradually set in the west. For some reason, Wajim suddenly thought of the fat Englishman who had tremblingly accepted the protest letter in front of the Chargé d'Affaires office just now. Didn't these gentlemen of the "empire on which the sun never sets" used to strut around the world? But what about today? The famous Arab poet Kahlil Gibran had these lines: "Every age has its owner. For some, it is the end of a century; for others, it may be the beginning of a century—the beginning of a golden age?!"

    "Yes, today the golden age belongs to the people," Wajim thought, stroking his neatly trimmed beard.

    "Classmates, how about we welcome our fellow student from the United Arab Republic to sing a song?" The enthusiastic Liu Chen finally broke the silence in the car, and then he turned around and asked Wajim, "Are you tired?"

    "No, not at all."

    Immediately, several students from the UAR began to sing: We have experienced the suffering of ruthless years, and we have also tasted the sweetness of happy times, but in this world, we have never found anything more precious than free labor! ...Their loud, tragic, and proud voices transported everyone to the Arab world struggling for freedom, as if the car was speeding through the scorching desert, facing the wind of the Persian Gulf!

    As Wajim sang, his eyes fell on Liu Chen's face. Liu Chen was listening attentively, his eyes shining with the flames of anger and the brilliance of victory, his mouth wide open, as if he was still shouting the slogan "Imperialists get out of Lebanon and Jordan" in front of the British. Wajim couldn't help but tightly hold his hand.

    Wajim and Liu Chen were in different departments and didn't even know each other yesterday, but today, hatred for the aggressors and love for peace, this common desire, closely linked them together! He could say that he already understood Liu Chen very well.

    He still remembered Liu Chen's excited expression during the parade. Liu Chen was so angry that his eyes were red. He opened his shirt, pointed to a scar on his chest, and said to Wajim, "Look! This is a 'masterpiece' of an American bullet on the Korean battlefield. If they dare to ignite the flames of war in the Middle East, I will enlist to go to the Arab world like I went to Korea!"

    Wajim was very excited, his big eyes filled with tears, gazing at Liu Chen. He respected this warrior who had shed blood for another nation from the bottom of his heart, just as he respected all upright and selfless people.

    He didn't answer, but reached out and hugged Liu Chen. In pure friendship, even without words, all thoughts, desires, and hopes can be understood.

    The car sped towards the school. The hearts of the two friends were beating strongly. Under the golden red glow of the sunset, Wajim seemed to still hear the earth-shaking voices of the crowd in Tiananmen Square.

### 在北京结成的友谊

    在北京结成的友谊
    北京大学学生　张炯
    高大的阿加·阿卜杜勒·瓦吉姆和刘晨并排靠车窗坐着。汽车驶过复兴门，闪过米黄色的中央广播大厦，在一条宽阔的绿荫覆盖的柏油路上行驶着。
    望着窗外北京夏天美丽的景色，瓦吉姆不禁想起在贝鲁特度过的令人怀恋的日子：蔚蓝的海滨、彩光闪闪的贝壳、秀美多姿的雪松、壮丽的波耳基广场……要是平日，他一定要对同学们眉飞色舞地描述自己故乡的一切，然而今天，贝鲁特的美好的形象在他心中破碎了：烟硝弥漫，美国坦克轧过断垣残壁、狙击手在掩体里射击着……
    汽车上全是北京大学的学生。有苏联人、朝鲜人、捷克人、阿尔巴尼亚人……一小时前，他们挥舞着拳头，高呼着口号，并肩走过英国代办处门口。现在，大家虽然默默坐着，但还没有从示威的亢奋中平静下来。
    酷热的太阳渐渐西沉了。不知怎么的，瓦吉姆突然想到刚才在代办处门前战战兢兢地接受抗议书的那个肥胖的英国人。这些“日不落国”的绅士，从前不是在全世界趾高气扬过么，但是今天呢？阿拉伯著名诗人凯罗·纪伯伦有这样的诗句：“时代也是有主人的。对于有些人，这是世纪末；对于另一些人，这也许是世纪初——黄金时代的开始呢？！”
    “是的，今天黄金的时代是属于人民的。”瓦吉姆摸着他那修整得十分整齐的胡子，想着。
    “同学们，欢迎阿联同学唱支歌好不好？”热情洋溢的刘晨终于打破了车里的沉默，接着他回头问瓦吉姆：“你累吗？”
    “不，一点也不累。”
    立即同几个阿联同学唱起来：我们经历过无情岁月的煎熬，也尝受过欢乐时光的甜蜜，但在这世界上，我们从未找到比自由的劳动更可贵的东西！……他们洪亮、悲壮而又自豪的声音，把大家带到为自由而斗争的阿拉伯世界，仿佛汽车正穿过灼热的沙漠、迎着波斯湾的风向前驰骋！
    瓦吉姆唱着，目光落在刘晨脸上。刘晨正凝神地谛听着，眼中闪耀着愤怒的火焰和胜利的光辉，张大嘴巴，好像他还在英国人面前高呼“帝国主义从黎巴嫩、约旦滚出去”的口号一样。瓦吉姆情不自禁地紧紧握住他的手。
    瓦吉姆和刘晨不同系，昨天还互不认识，可是今天对于侵略者的仇恨，对于和平的热爱，这共同的意愿却使他们紧紧地联在一起了！他可以说已经非常了解刘晨了。
    他还记得，游行时刘晨那激动的神情，刘晨激怒得眼都红了。他敞开上衣，指着胸前的一块伤疤，对瓦吉姆说：“看吧！这是美国子弹在朝鲜战场的‘杰作’。要是他们敢在中东烧起战争的烈火，我就会像到朝鲜那样，报名到阿拉伯去！”
    瓦吉姆十分激动，他的大眼睛含着泪花，凝望着刘晨。他从心里尊敬这个曾经为了别的民族而流过血的战士，正像他尊敬一切正直无私的人一样。
    他没有回答，伸手抱住了刘晨。在纯真的友谊里，即使不用言语，一切的思想、愿望、希冀，都会得到了解。
    汽车向学校驰去。两个朋友的心强烈地跳动着。金红的霞辉下，瓦吉姆似乎还听到天安门广场撼天动地的人声。
