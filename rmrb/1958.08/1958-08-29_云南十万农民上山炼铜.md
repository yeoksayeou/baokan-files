Yunnan province has mobilized ten thousand farmers to go up the mountains to smelt copper.

　　“Copper is the vice-marshal; it is the steel of non-ferrous metals.” This is the action policy put forward by the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee. Recently, Yunnan Province organized 100,000 farmers to go up the mountains to build native furnaces and engage in native methods of copper smelting on a large scale.
    Of the 126 counties in Yunnan Province, 102 have discovered copper mines, with more than 460 mine locations found. Many people in the province have over 300 years of ancestral experience in copper smelting. Yunnan Province organized 100,000 farmers to go up the mountains, and in July and August, built 2,000 native furnaces with a daily output of 100 kilograms each, aiming to produce 20,000 tons of copper this year and 80,000 tons next year.
    Combining native and foreign methods, with native methods supporting foreign methods, is the path Yunnan Province is taking to develop its copper industry self-reliantly. Yunnan Province has determined that in the next two years, over 90% of crude copper production (100% this year) will rely on native methods; the copper production of each prefecture and county will account for 66% to 82% of the province's total copper production. Lijiang, Dali, and other prefectures are determined to rely on their own strength to make their copper production on par with the nationally renowned Dongchuan and Yimen copper mines.
    In order to solve the problems in native smelting, such as low resource grade, unfamiliarity with ore characteristics, low copper recovery rates, and the inability of some units to produce copper, Yunnan Province has decided to take the following measures after organizing experience exchanges: First, strengthen native ore dressing. Mobilize the masses to insist on hand-picking to improve the furnace input grade. Widely promote animal-drawn blowers, water-powered blowers, and wind-powered blowers to change the manual pushing method. Second, organize three collaboration zones in southern, northern, and eastern Yunnan, requiring units with a longer history and better conditions to support those with poorer conditions. Organize study, use factories to lead factories, and old factories to support new factories to leap forward together. Third, conduct on-site investigations and mobilize local experts. It is also planned to transfer 50 master craftsmen from Dongchuan, organized by the Yunnan Metallurgical Bureau to form ten roving groups to provide guidance to areas with weaker foundations. Localities also organize on-site training, guaranteeing instruction and learning, to train native copper smelting personnel.
    By the end of July, people of all ethnic groups in the Lijiang area had used native methods to build 29 copper factories and 64 copper smelting furnaces in the area, of which 49 furnaces had been put into production and more than 100 tons of copper had been smelted. (Attached picture)

### 云南十万农民上山炼铜

　　云南十万农民上山炼铜
    本报讯　“铜是副帅，是有色金属中的钢铁”。这是云南省委提出的行动方针。最近云南省组织十万农民上山，大建土炉，大搞土法炼铜。
    云南省一百二十六个县中，已有一百零二个县发现有铜矿，找到的矿点已有四百六十多处，省里很多群众有三百多年的祖传炼铜经验。云南省组织十万农民上山，在7、8两个月内，建成日产一百公斤的土炉二千座，今年产铜两万吨，明年产铜八万吨。
    土洋并举、以土养洋是云南省自力更生地发展铜工业所走的道路。云南省确定在今、明两年内，粗铜的生产90％以上（今年是百分之百）依靠土法；各专区、县的铜产量将占全省铜产量66％到82％。丽江、大理等专区决心要依靠自己的力量，使铜产量和全国闻名的东川和易门铜矿并驾齐驱。
    为了解决土法冶炼中资源品位较低、对矿石特性没有摸熟、铜的回收率低和部分单位炼不出铜等问题，云南省经过组织经验交流，决定采取以下措施：一、加强土法选矿。发动群众坚持手选，提高入炉品位。广泛推广马拉鼓风机、水推鼓风机和风力鼓风机，设法改变人推的办法。二、组织滇南、滇北、滇东三个协作区，要求历史较久、条件较好的单位支援条件较差的单位。组织留学，以厂带厂、老厂包新厂，共同跃进。三、就地调查和发动土专家。还准备从东川抽调五十名老师傅，由云南冶金局负责组成十个巡回小组，到基础较差的地区进行指导。各地并组织现场培训，包教包学，培训土法炼铜人员。
    云南丽江区各族人民到7月底已用土办法在全区建成了二十九个铜厂、六十四个炼铜炉子，其中四十九个炉子已投入生产，并已炼出了一百多吨铜。（附图片）
