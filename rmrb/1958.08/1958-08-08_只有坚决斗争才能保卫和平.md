The communiqué of the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people of all countries in the world. The Beijing communiqué reiterated: "China and the Soviet Union will do everything possible to continue to work to ease international tensions and prevent new war disasters." The communiqué stated that the two countries firmly advocated the immediate convening of a summit conference of the great powers to discuss the situation in the Middle East and firmly demanded that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Immediately following the Sino-Soviet meeting communiqué, Soviet Premier Khrushchev wrote to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France on the 5th, suggesting that an emergency session of the UN General Assembly be convened immediately under the conditions of the US and British obstruction of a summit conference of the great powers, in order to quickly realize the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and to promote the holding of a high-level meeting. Obviously, this suggestion is fully consistent with the spirit of the meeting communiqué. We Chinese people fully support this new proposal of the Soviet government.

The Beijing meeting communiqué of the top leaders of China and the Soviet Union put forward a series of proposals aimed at easing international tensions and preventing new wars. China and the Soviet Union advocate that all peoples have the right to choose their own socio-political systems, that countries with different social systems must implement peaceful coexistence based on the Five Principles, that all international disputes should be resolved peacefully, and that economic and cultural relations between countries should be developed on the basis of mutual benefit and peaceful competition. China and the Soviet Union believe that in order to maintain and consolidate peace, all countries should currently reach agreements on disarmament, cessation of testing and prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, abolition of all military blocs and all military bases set up in foreign countries, and conclusion of peace and collective security treaties. Both China and the Soviet Union have consistently strived to realize these peace-keeping propositions in the past and at present. However, as everyone knows, the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism has stubbornly refused to reach agreement on these issues. Therefore, for a long time, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines on international issues: one is the line of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and peoples, which is the line of easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace; the other is the line of the aggressive bloc and colonial ruling bloc headed by US imperialism, which is the line of maintaining and intensifying international tensions and stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. Long-term historical experience has proven that to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist aggressive bloc.

The meeting communiqué pointed out: "Whether war can be avoided cannot depend solely on the good wishes of peace-loving people and their unilateral efforts. The aggressive blocs of the Western powers have so far refused to take any serious steps to maintain peace, but instead have unscrupulously intensified international tensions, bringing mankind to the brink of war. However, they should know that if the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples will unite closely to completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors and lay the foundation for lasting world peace." This firm principled stance of the Chinese and Soviet governments and peoples on the issue of world peace has left a deep impression on world public opinion.

Imperialists often scare those who are weak-nerved, saying it's either surrender or war. Imperialist spokesmen often spread a fallacy that peace can only be achieved by following the aggressors' lead and accommodating them. Some soft-hearted pacifists also naively imagine that in order to ease the situation, enemies must not be provoked in any way. Therefore, they dare not condemn war instigators, are unwilling to investigate the responsibility for war and the danger of war, and do not want to distinguish right from wrong on the issue of war and peace. Some people groundlessly assert that peace can be achieved as long as armed resistance against the offensives of imperialists and colonialists is abandoned and no tit-for-tat struggle is waged against them. However, countless historical facts prove that this pacifist position is of no help to peace. As far as the historical experience of our Chinese people is concerned, the lessons are painful. More than 20 years ago, when Japanese imperialists occupied the three northeastern provinces of our country and then invaded North China, the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the instigation of the US and British governments, adopted a policy of non-resistance, but the Japanese aggressors still went further, and finally launched a war of aggression against China. It was only because the Chinese people persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party that the Japanese aggressors were finally defeated. After World War II, the world was on the verge of another major war several times, but it was not due to surrendering to the aggressors, but due to waging a resolute struggle against the aggressors, that peace was finally saved. The distant examples are the Korean War and the Indochina War, where the aggressors were ultimately forced to accept an armistice due to resolute resistance to them; the more recent examples are the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt and the US-British conspiracy to launch an aggression against Syria, which were also due to Egypt and Syria waging a resolute struggle against the aggressors with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and peoples of the world, forcing the Anglo-French invading forces to withdraw from Egypt and forcing US imperialism to dare not recklessly launch a war of aggression against Syria.

The recent events of US-British aggression in the Middle East also convincingly demonstrate that only resolute struggle can defend peace. When the US and Britain began sending troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, they pointed their spearhead at the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic, with an imposing manner. It was precisely because socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China promptly issued stern warnings that the US-British aggression could not be ignored and that they could not stand idly by, and it was precisely because the people of the Middle East strengthened their struggle to safeguard national independence with the support of socialist countries and world progressive public opinion, that US-British imperialism fell into a situation of being besieged on all sides, and their aggressive actions had to be restrained to some extent. It is conceivable that if a resolute struggle attitude had not been adopted towards the aggressors, but a vacillating and compromising attitude had been adopted, then the arrogance of the US-British aggressors would have been even more rampant, the flames of war might have spread to Iraq and the UAR, and another world war might have already broken out. Of course, the victory achieved by the forces of peace in the struggle to stop the US-British aggressors from launching a war in the Middle East is only a preliminary one. The situation in the Middle East is still tense. At present, the US and Britain are attempting to orchestrate new political conspiracies through the United Nations organization and Murphy's activities; on the other hand, US troops are赖 (lai - rely on; hang around) in Lebanon without any reason, and are continuously landing in Lebanon day after day; British troops are also 赖 (lai - rely on; hang around) in Jordan, and in addition to continuing to airdrop in Jordan, they are also gathering in the Persian Gulf area south of Iraq; Turkish troops are still gathered on the borders of the United Arab Republic's Syrian region and Iraq. These signs show that the US-British aggressors still want to continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, and still attempt to expand their aggression against Iraq and the UAR. The war crisis in the Middle East is still serious, the vigilance against the aggressors must not be lowered for a moment, and the struggle to defend peace must not be relaxed at all.

Peace can only be won, peace cannot be begged for. Imperialists have always been bullies who are afraid of the tough, bullies who are afraid of strength, bullies who are divided and afraid of unity. In the short ten years or so after the war, the series of great victories won by the people of Asia and Africa in the struggle against aggression, against colonialism, safeguarding independence, and defending peace, were all achieved through resolute struggle. In these struggles, the aggressors sometimes appeared to be strong at first, but because they were doing unjust deeds and were opposed by the people, they ultimately failed. The outcome of these struggles proves that as long as the forces of peace unite, as long as they rely on the people, even the most ferocious US imperialism can be defeated, and there is nothing to fear. Adopting an attitude of compromise and appeasement towards the imperialist aggressors can only result in submission, not complete success. When propagating peace, if one does not point out the root cause of the danger of war, point out that the forces of peace must unite to wage a resolute struggle against the forces of war, and that it is entirely possible to win victory in the struggle, and point out that if war maniacs impose war on the people, then the people must rise up to eliminate the manufacturers of war, the imperialist system, on the contrary, if one only makes the people indulge in the illusion of peace and the terror of war, then once war comes, people will be panicked and helpless. Only by thoroughly exposing and severely criticizing the imperialists' war conspiracies, correctly pointing out the source of the danger of war and the way to stop it, making the masses of the people fully mentally prepared, having high morale and confidence in victory, and mobilizing to fight for peace, can we effectively defend peace and stop aggression. Even if the enemy goes crazy and launches a war, the mentally prepared masses of the people will never panic and will certainly be able to rise up to resist the aggressors and eliminate the aggressors.

Many historical facts of the twentieth century clearly tell people that on the world issue of peace and war, it is difficult for any country to take a detached attitude of standing aloof from the matter. Before World War II, during the period when Hitler was frantically preparing for a war of aggression, many large and small capitalist countries in Europe were intimidated by Hitler and paralyzed by the Munich policy of the US, British, and French ruling blocs, and dared not support the Soviet Union's proposal for collective security, were unwilling to unite to prevent aggression, and repeatedly compromised and retreated to the aggressors, resulting in their inability to maintain neutrality and avoid destruction in World War II. After World War II, a series of socialist countries emerged, forming the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The existence and development of this camp is a fatal blow to the imperialist aggressive forces and the greatest guarantee for the cause of peace. Therefore, after the end of World War II, after the formation of the socialist camp as a pillar of peace, the head of the aggressive camp, the main planner of new wars, US imperialism, tried every possible means to obstruct the unity of all socialist forces, anti-colonialist forces, and anti-war forces. US imperialism and its agents threatened and lured certain people to adopt a policy of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs" on the world issue of peace and war. This is not only to disintegrate the forces of peace, but also to facilitate its oppression of these countries that are isolated and helpless because they are afraid of struggle and oppose unity. Peace is indivisible, and the forces of peace can only avoid being defeated one by one if they unite together. It is impossible and detrimental to people themselves to try to stand aloof from peace and war. In order to stop the US-British aggressors' military adventures and political conspiracies in the Middle East, and in order to strive for lasting peace, all forces of peace, especially the forces of socialism and national independence movements, must unite closely and fight for common interests. The meeting communiqué of the leaders of China and the Soviet Union has clearly announced: "China and the Soviet Union firmly support the just struggles of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and other Arab countries, and firmly support the national independence movements of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries." As long as these two forces unite with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in the cause of peace, then their strength will be invincible in the world, and peace will surely be defended.

Justice and advantage are on the side of the peace-loving people of the world, but the danger of war must be extinguished as soon as possible, one must not shrink back from the aggressors, the struggle to defend peace must not be hesitated, and one must continue to work hard to defend peace and oppose aggression.

### 只有坚决斗争才能保卫和平

    只有坚决斗争才能保卫和平
    毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的北京会谈公报，受到了世界各国爱好和平人民的热烈的欢迎。北京会谈公报重申：“中苏两国将竭尽一切可能，继续为和缓国际紧张局势、防止新的战争灾难而努力。”公报表示两国坚决主张立即召开大国政府首脑会议讨论中近东局势，并且坚决要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出他们的军队。
    紧接在中苏会谈公报以后，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在5日写信给美英法三国政府首脑，建议在美英阻挠大国政府首脑会议的条件下立即召集联大紧急会议，以便迅速实现美英军队从黎巴嫩、约旦的撤退，并且促进最高级会议的举行。很明显，这个建议是同会谈公报的精神完全一致的。我们中国人民完全支持苏联政府的这个新的建议。
    中苏两国最高领导人的北京会谈公报中，提出了一系列的旨在和缓国际紧张局势和防止新战争的主张。中苏两国主张：各国人民有权选择自己的社会政治制度，不同社会制度的国家必须根据五项原则实行和平共处，一切国际争端应当和平解决，应当在互利和和平竞赛的基础上发展各国之间的经济和文化关系。中苏两国认为，为了维护和巩固和平，目前各国应该达成关于裁减军备、停止试验和禁止使用原子武器和氢武器、取消一切军事集团和在外国设置的一切军事基地、缔结和平和集体安全公约的协议。中苏两国无论在过去和现在都一贯地为实现这些维护和平的主张而努力。但是，大家知道，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，一直顽固地拒绝就这些问题达成协议。因此，长久以来，在国际问题上一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争，一条是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和爱好和平的国家和人民的路线，这是和缓国际紧张局势、维护世界和平的路线，另一条是以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团和殖民统治集团的路线，这是保持和加剧国际紧张局势、加紧扩军备战的路线。长期的历史经验证明，要和缓国际紧张局势，要维护世界和平，就必须向帝国主义侵略集团进行坚决的斗争。
    会谈公报指出：“战争能否避免，不能仅靠爱好和平人民的善良愿望和他们单方面的努力。西方大国的侵略集团至今拒绝对于维护和平采取任何认真的步骤，反而肆无忌惮地加剧国际紧张局势，使人类濒于战争灾难的边缘。但是，他们应当知道，如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”中苏两国政府和人民对世界和平问题的这种坚定的原则立场，给世界舆论留下了深刻的印象。
    帝国主义者经常吓唬那些神经脆弱的人，要就是屈服，要就是战争。帝国主义者的代言人经常散布一种谬论，似乎只有仰承侵略者的鼻息，只有迁就侵略者，才能求得和平。有些软心肠的和平主义者也天真地设想，为了使局势和缓，就必须无论怎样也不刺激敌人。因此他们不敢谴责战争挑拨者，不愿追究战争和战争危险的责任，不想在战争和和平问题上明辨是非。有些人没有根据地断定，只要对帝国主义者、殖民主义者的进攻放弃武力抵抗，不向他们进行针锋相对的斗争，就可以取得和平。但是无数的历史事实证明，这种和平主义者的立场，对于和平是无济于事的。就我们中国人民的历史经验来说，教训是惨痛的。二十多年前当日本帝国主义者侵占了我国东北三省并进而侵略华北的时候，国民党反动派在美英两国政府的唆使下，采取了不抵抗政策，但是日本侵略者依然得寸进尺，终于发动了侵华战争。只是由于中国人民在中国共产党领导下坚持抗日战争，日本侵略者才最后被打败了。第二次世界大战后，世界曾经几次濒于爆发大战的边缘，但都不是由于对侵略者屈服，而是由于对侵略者进行坚决的斗争，才最后拯救了和平。远的如朝鲜战争和印度支那战争，由于坚决反抗侵略者而最后迫使它们接受了停战；近的如英法侵略埃及的战争和美英阴谋发动侵略叙利亚的事件，也是由于埃及和叙利亚在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界各国爱好和平国家和人民的有力支持下对侵略者进行了坚决的斗争，才迫使英法侵略军退出埃及，迫使美帝国主义不敢冒然发动侵叙战争。
    最近发生的美英侵略中东的事件，也令人信服地表明了只有坚决的斗争才能保卫和平。当美英开始派兵侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的时候，它们把矛头指向伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国，气势汹汹。正是由于苏联、中国等社会主义国家及时发出了对美英侵略行为不能置若罔闻、不能袖手旁观的严厉警告，正是由于中东人民在社会主义国家和世界进步舆论的支持之下加强维护民族独立的斗争，美英帝国主义才陷于四面皆敌的境地，他们的侵略行为才不得不有所收敛。可以设想，如果对侵略者不是采取坚决斗争的态度，而是采取动摇妥协的态度，那末，美英侵略者的气焰一定更加嚣张，战争的火焰可能已蔓延到伊拉克和阿联，又一次大战可能已经爆发了。当然，和平力量在制止美英侵略者在中东发动战争的斗争中所取得的胜利只是初步的。目前中东的局势仍然紧张。现在，美英一方面企图通过联合国组织和墨菲的活动，布置新的政治阴谋；另一方面，美国军队毫无理由地赖在黎巴嫩，而且连日不断在黎巴嫩登陆；英国军队同样赖在约旦，而且除了继续在约旦空降以外，还在伊拉克南面的波斯湾地区集结；土耳其军队仍然集结在阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区和伊拉克边境。这些征候说明，美英侵略者仍然要继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，仍然企图扩大侵略伊拉克和阿联，中东的战争危机仍然是严重的，对侵略者的警惕一刻不容降低，保卫和平的斗争一点不能放松。
    和平只能争取，和平不能乞求。帝国主义者从来是欺软怕硬，欺弱怕强，欺分散而怕团结的。在战后短短的十几年中，亚非人民在反对侵略、反对殖民主义、保卫独立、保卫和平的斗争中所赢得的一连串的伟大胜利，没有一次不是经过坚决的斗争取得的。在这些斗争中，侵略者有时起初表面上是强者，但由于干的是非正义勾当，受到人民的反对，最后还是失败了。这些斗争的结局证明：只要和平力量团结起来，只要依靠人民，最凶恶的美帝国主义也可以打败，并没有什么可怕。对帝国主义侵略者采取委曲求全的态度，结果只能屈服，不能求全。在宣传和平的时候如果不指出战争危险的根源，指出和平力量必须团结起来同战争势力作坚决的斗争，并且完全有可能在斗争中取得胜利，指出万一战争狂人把战争强加于人民则人民必须奋起消灭战争的制造者帝国主义制度，相反地，如果只是使人民沉溺于和平的幻想和战争的恐怖之中，那么，一旦战争临头，便会人心惶惶，束手无策。只有彻底地揭露和严厉地斥责帝国主义的战争阴谋，正确地指明战争的危险来源和制止之道，使人民群众有充分的精神准备，有昂扬的斗志和胜利的信心，动员起来为和平而斗争，才能有效地保卫和平，制止侵略。即使敌人发疯，竟然发动战争，精神上有准备的人民群众也决不会惊慌失措，一定能够奋起抵抗侵略者、消灭侵略者。
    二十世纪的许多历史事实清清楚楚地告诉人们：在和平和战争这个世界问题上，任何国家都很难采取置身度外的超然态度。在第二次世界大战之前，在希特勒疯狂地准备侵略战争的时期，欧洲许多大小资本主义国家受了希特勒的恐吓和美英法统治集团的慕尼黑政策的麻痹，不敢支持苏联的集体安全的主张，不愿联合起来防范侵略，对侵略者一再妥协退让，结果在第二次世界大战中虽欲保持中立和避免灭亡而不可得。第二次世界大战后，产生了一系列社会主义国家，形成了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，这个阵营的存在和发展，是对于帝国主义侵略势力的致命打击，是和平事业的最大保证。所以，在第二次世界大战结束，作为和平支柱的社会主义阵营形成之后，侵略阵营的首脑、新战争的主要策划者美帝国主义，就千方百计地阻碍一切社会主义力量、反殖民主义力量、反战争力量的联合。美帝国主义及其代理人威胁利诱某些人对和平和战争这个世界问题采取“各人自扫门前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜”的政策。这不但是为了瓦解和平力量，也是为了便于它压迫这些因为害怕斗争、反对联合而孤立无援的国家。和平是不可分割的，爱好和平的力量只有团结在一起，才能避免被各个击破。人们要想超然站在和平和战争之外，那是不可能而且对他们自己不利的。为了制止美英侵略者在中东的军事冒险和政治阴谋，为了争取巩固的和平，一切和平力量，首先是社会主义和民族独立运动的力量，不能不紧密地联合起来，为共同的利益奋斗。中苏两国领导人的会谈公报中已经明白宣布：“中苏两国坚决支持阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动。”而只要这两支力量同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民在和平的事业中联合起来，那么，它们的力量就无敌于天下，和平就一定能够保卫住。
    正义和优势在爱好和平的世界人民这一边，但是战争的危险要趁早扑灭，对侵略者不能畏缩，保卫和平的斗争不能犹豫，必须再接再厉地为保卫和平、反对侵略而斗争。
