　　Workers and Peasants Join Forces to Save the Machine
　　At nine o'clock on the evening of July 22nd, the Ming River Bridge construction site on the double-track Jinghan Railway was brightly lit. To complete the bridge construction ahead of schedule, we were working day and night. Suddenly, floodwaters surged from the upper reaches of the Ming River. Before we could protect the universal pile driver parked on the tracks, the floodwaters washed away the tracks. The sleepers floated downstream, and the universal pile driver was about to fall. The Party Branch Secretary of the construction site quickly led all of us to jump into the floodwaters, using sandbags and large stones to protect the pile driver and salvage the sleepers.
　　Just as we were fighting the flood, suddenly hundreds of farmers ran from all directions, and without a word, jumped into the water to help us protect the machine and salvage materials. Where did this support army come from? It turned out they were members of nearby agricultural cooperatives. They were in a meeting and heard the shouts from our site. Knowing there was an accident, they immediately stopped the meeting and came to help. With more people, there was more strength, and we finally overcame the flood, quickly protecting the machine. All the scattered sleepers were also salvaged.
　　After everyone came ashore, the Party Branch Secretary, on behalf of the construction site workers, said to the peasant brothers: "To thank you for your support, we will definitely build a strong bridge, so that this bridge will benefit the broad masses of people!"

　　工农协力救机器
    7月22日晚上九点钟，京汉铁路复线洺河大桥工地上灯火通明。为了提前完成筑桥工程，我们正在昼夜不停地施工。忽然，洺河上游涌来大水。我们还没有来得及把停在轨道上的万能打桩机围护起来，大水就把轨道冲开了。枕木顺流而下，万能打桩机眼看就要倒下去。工地党支部书记急忙率领我们全体职工跳入洪水中，用沙草袋、大石头围护打桩机，打捞枕木。
    正当我们同洪水搏斗的时候，突然由四面八方跑来百十多个农民，不容分说，就跳入水中帮助我们围护机器和抢救物资。这批支援大军从哪里来的呢？原来是附近农业社的社员。他们正在开会，听见我们这里人声喊叫，知道工地上出了事故，便立刻停止开会赶来支援。人多力量大，我们终于战胜了洪水，很快地把机器围护住；冲散了的枕木，也全部打捞上来。
    大家来到河岸上以后，党支部书记代表我们工地职工对农民兄弟说：“为了感谢你们的支援，我们一定修建一座坚固的大桥，让这座大桥为广大人民造福！”
