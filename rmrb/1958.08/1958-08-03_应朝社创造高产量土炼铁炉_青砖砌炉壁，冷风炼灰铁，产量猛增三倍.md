    Ying Chao Cooperative Creates High-Yielding Indigenous Iron Smelting Furnace
    Blue Brick Furnace Walls, Cold Air to Smelt Pig Iron, Output Soars Threefold
    (Our reporters Wu Zanting and Fan Yinhuai report) The experience of the Ying Chao Iron Production Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, in using anthracite coal and cold air to smelt pig iron in indigenous blast furnaces, has received widespread attention across the country and is being widely promoted. The Ministry of Light Industry and the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives recently organized more than 400 cadres and worker representatives from 23 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to visit the Ying Chao Cooperative to learn about the cooperative's experience in building and operating indigenous blast furnaces.
    The members of the Ying Chao Iron Production Cooperative, with their intelligence and talent, extracted the advantages of China's four indigenous iron smelting methods: blast furnace body, plow-faced furnace waist, round furnace tuyeres, and square furnace flues, to build a unique indigenous blast furnace. The characteristics of this indigenous blast furnace are low cost, speed, simple operation technology, and high production efficiency. It does not use steel plates or refractory bricks, but uses blue bricks to build the furnace walls and sand and stone to line the swirls, taking the stovepipes from heating stoves as ventilation ducts; it can use locally produced anthracite coal instead of coke as fuel, and can smelt pig iron with cold air without a hot blast stove. Because the ore, fuel, and equipment are all locally sourced, an investment of only 400 yuan can build an indigenous blast furnace with an effective volume of 1.5 cubic meters in four days. This indigenous blast furnace uses a 25-horsepower portable boiler as power to drive an indigenous blower to blow air. After being put into production, its daily output reaches more than 1,800 catties, more than three times that of the original indigenous blast furnace. After multiple chemical tests, it has been proven that this pig iron has strong shock resistance, high tensile strength, and transverse compressive strength, and can be used to cast precision machine castings such as ball bearing cylinders, air cylinders, and hydraulic presses. Engineers from the Black Metallurgy Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently analyzed the characteristics of this indigenous blast furnace at the Ying Chao Cooperative and believe that it is a great revolution in China's 2,000-year-old indigenous iron smelting technology. Any township, commune, institution, school, or organization with ore resources can build it in large quantities.
    After visiting the Ying Chao Iron Production Cooperative, representatives from various places expressed that they would take the Ying Chao Cooperative as an example, determined to abandon the idea of waiting for equipment and pursuing modernization, and adopt the method of starting from small to large and from indigenous to foreign, to develop local metallurgical industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    应朝社创造高产量土炼铁炉
    青砖砌炉壁，冷风炼灰铁，产量猛增三倍
    本报讯　记者武赞庭、范银怀报道：山西省阳城县应朝铁业生产合作社创造的土高炉用无烟煤、冷风炼灰生铁的经验，受到了全国各地的重视并开始普遍推广。轻工业部和手工业合作总社最近组织了全国二十三个省、市、自治区的四百多名干部和职工代表，到应朝社参观学习了这个社建筑和操作土高炉的经验。
    应朝铁业社的社员们，以自己的聪明和才智，摄取了我国四种土法炼铁的优点：高炉身，犁面炉腰，圆炉风嘴、方炉风道，建成了别具风格的土高炉。这种土高炉的特点是花钱少、速度快、操作技术简便、生产效率高。它不用钢板、耐火砖，而是青砖砌炉壁，砂石衬旋，取暖火炉的烟筒当通风管道；可以用当地产的无烟煤代替焦炭作燃料，没有热风炉而用冷风就能炼出灰生铁。由于矿石、燃料和器材都是就地取材，仅以四百元的投资在四天内建成有效容积一点五立方公尺的土高炉，这种土高炉是用二十五马力的锅驼机作动力带动土制鼓风机鼓风，在投入生产后，它的日产量达一千八百多斤，比原有的土高炉提高三倍多。经过多次化验证明，这种灰生铁抗震力强，有高度拉力和横压强度，可铸造滚珠筒、气缸、水压机等精密机器铸件。冶金工业部黑色冶金设计院的工程师最近到应朝社分析了这种土高炉的特点后，认为是我国两千年来土法炼铁技术的大革命，凡是有矿石资源的乡、社、机关、学校、团体都可以大量兴建。
    各地代表在参观了应朝铁业社以后纷纷表示要以应朝社作榜样，决心抛弃等待设备，追求现代化的思想，采取由小到大，先土后洋的办法，多快好省地发展地方冶金工业。
