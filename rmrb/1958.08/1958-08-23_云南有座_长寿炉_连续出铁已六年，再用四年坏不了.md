People's Daily, Kunming, August 22nd (Reporter Tian Lianggeng) -- A native blast furnace in Sipu Iron Factory, Pu'er County, Yunnan Province, has been continuously producing iron for six years, averaging 2,200 kilograms of pig iron per day. This fact is a powerful refutation of the "short-lived" theory of native blast furnaces.

This native blast furnace was built in 1952, and its appearance remains unchanged to this day, as good as new. No one can say for sure how many more years it can produce iron, but it is said that it can be used for at least another four years.

This native furnace is about nine meters high, and its shape is square, like a bunker. The hearth is circular, with a volume of fourteen cubic meters. The furnace cylinder is made of large blocks of refractory and wear-resistant stone, surrounded by a mud wall several feet thick, and pine wood piles are driven around the mud wall to prevent collapse. There is no electricity or modern power equipment here. The iron factory uses water-powered impact blowers to deliver cold air for ironmaking. The factory's workers used these simple, native tools to create the miracle of the native blast furnace's longevity.

The reason why this native furnace is long-lived is not due to any peculiar "magic formula," but simply because a group of young workers, encouraged by the Party, broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, actively studied, and overcame difficulties. In early 1954, more than ten young and strong road construction workers, including He Mingcheng (Yi ethnicity), were transferred to the native furnace as apprentices. This iron factory had been established for decades, and all the masters were hired from distant counties at very high wages. During the rainy season of 1954, the old masters routinely shut down the furnace and went home. They believed that it was impossible to produce iron in the rainy season due to the damp ground and low temperature, and that the furnace was prone to accidents. Although the iron factory leaders repeatedly mobilized them to break the routine and continue production, they still insisted: "This is something no one has ever done before!" They repeatedly instructed to shut down the furnace when they left. In order to break the superstition that production was impossible in the rainy season, and also to enable the apprentices to quickly master the technology, the iron factory resolutely encouraged the apprentices to continue operating the furnace. He Mingcheng and other apprentices encountered difficulties as soon as they started operating the furnace, and no molten iron was produced for two consecutive days. At this time, some people took the opportunity to sarcastically say: "Even the old masters with decades of experience dare not do it, and these little apprentices are just daydreaming!" But the Party organization immediately provided assistance, mobilizing all the workers in the factory to help them knock out the solidified molten iron in shifts, and the factory director personally went to the furnace to guide them, saving the native furnace. Based on the lessons learned from this accident, they opened ventilation ditches at the bottom of the furnace to avoid damp ground air in the rainy season, and burned firewood in the ditches to maintain the temperature inside the furnace, and established maintenance systems such as handover, inspection, and overhaul. In this way, this native blast furnace was tamed by the apprentices.

Over the past few years, He Mingcheng and others have worked diligently, and through research such as comparing the various types of iron produced under different fire colors and the impact of the wind nozzle at different inclination angles on the molten iron, they have skillfully mastered the ironmaking technology.

The old masters who were hired by the iron factory stopped coming in 1955, and their assertion that the "life span" of the native furnace would not exceed three years was also shattered by the iron facts.

### 云南有座“长寿炉”  连续出铁已六年，再用四年坏不了

　　云南有座“长寿炉”
    连续出铁已六年，再用四年坏不了
    本报昆明22日电　记者田良耕报道：云南省普洱县思普铁厂的一只土高炉已经连续出了六年铁，平均日产生铁二千二百公斤。这个事实对于土高炉“短寿论”者是个有力的驳斥。
    这只土高炉是1952年兴建的，它的容貌迄今未变，完好如初。究竟它还能出几年铁，谁也难于断定，据说，它至少还可以使用四年。
    这座土炉高约九公尺，外形四四方方地像座碉堡。炉膛是圆形的，容积为十四立方公尺。炉缸是用耐火、耐磨的大石块砌成的，外面用几尺厚的泥墙箍起，并且又围绕泥墙打上了松木桩，以防止倒塌。这里没有电也没有现代化的动力设备，铁厂利用水力冲击鼓风机，输送冷风炼铁。铁厂的职工们就是用这些简陋的土玩意儿，创造出了土高炉长寿的奇迹。
    这座土炉所以长寿，并没有什么奇特的“妙方”，只是因为一批青年工人在党的鼓励下破除了迷信，解放了思想，积极钻研，战胜了困难。1954年初，何明成（彝族）等十多个年青力壮的筑路民工被调到土炉上当学徒工。这个铁厂建立几十年了，而所有师傅都是从遥远的县份花极高的工钱请来的。1954年的雨季，老师傅照例停炉回家了。他们认为雨季地潮温度低，根本炼不出铁，而且炉子易出事故。虽然铁厂领导方面一再动员他们打破常规，照常生产，可是他们仍然坚持地说：“这是从来没有人干过的事！”他们临行的时候，还再三嘱咐要停炉。铁厂为了破除雨季不能生产的迷信，也为了使学徒工很快掌握技术，毅然放手鼓励学徒继续开炉。何明成等学徒工一开始掌炉炼铁就遇到困难，一连两天都不出铁水。这时，有人便趁机讽刺说：“几十年老师傅都不敢干，小小学徒真是妄想！”但是党组织马上给予帮助，动员全厂工人分班帮助他们敲出凝结的铁水，厂长亲自到炉子上指导，挽救了土炉。他们根据这次事故的教训，在炉底开了通风沟，避免雨季地气潮湿，并且在沟里烧火保持炉内温度，建立了交班、检查、检修等维护制度。就这样，这座土高炉就被学徒们驯服了。
    几年来，何明成等刻苦钻研，通过在不同火色下炼出的各种铁的比较、风嘴在不同倾斜角度下对铁水的影响等研究，已经熟练地掌握了炼铁技术。
    铁厂请来的老师傅从1955年起不来了，他们下定的土炉“寿命活不过三年”的断言，也被铁的事实粉碎了。
