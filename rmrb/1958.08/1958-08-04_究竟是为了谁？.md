    For Whose Sake, After All?
    Shi Lü

    On the fourth day (July 19th) of the American invading troops landing in Lebanon, Eisenhower, in order to answer the question raised by the American soldiers in Lebanon that "they don't know why they are there," delivered a radio address from his office to those American soldiers on the scorching Lebanese beaches. In this speech, the American president told those uneasy American soldiers that "you are there to help the Lebanese people maintain their freedom," but he couldn't help but say, "While you are in Lebanon," "this will be a difficult time for you all." Now, it has been more than ten days since the American president said those words, it is indeed "a period of time"; during this "period of time," if those American soldiers are still baffled by their mission of "helping the Lebanese people maintain their freedom," then they have quite a good understanding of what Eisenhower said, "This will be a difficult time."

    For example, according to Eisenhower, these American soldiers were invited "as friends to go there (Lebanon)," however, the Lebanese people do not welcome these "friends," on the contrary, they want these "friends" to go back as soon as possible; they do not present flowers to "friends," but throw grenades at "friends"; they do not treat "friends" with champagne, but treat "friends" with exploding soda. This naturally makes those who are "friends" feel very difficult. This still refers to the daytime, once night falls, the "friends" are not only in a "difficult period," but simply in a period of neurasthenia, so that they have already shot two of their own people, plus a mule!

    However, just as the American soldiers are experiencing a "difficult period" in Lebanon, Eisenhower's friends are therefore experiencing a period of jubilation.

    On the day of the successful Iraqi revolution, the stocks of various American oil companies plummeted on the market, becoming what the Associated Press described as "the worst drop this year." People do not need to witness it face-to-face to imagine the frowning faces of Eisenhower's oil enterprise friends. However, in just twenty-four hours, Eisenhower sent American soldiers to Lebanon to endure difficulties so that his friends could continue to extract more than ten billion US dollars of net profit from the Middle East every year. As a result, oil stocks soared, and frowning faces immediately turned into beaming faces.

    The degree of jubilation of Eisenhower's other big business friends is no less than that of his oil industry friends. The American steel industry magazine "Steel" excitedly announced: the Middle East crisis has greatly helped the steel industry overcome its recession, and after months of poor sales, automobile orders have suddenly increased. The American Douglas Aircraft Company seized the opportunity and hurriedly sent people to Japan to open a new company, it is said that the Middle East may become a second Korea, and Japan will become the military supply base of the United States again. American senators are also not lagging behind Eisenhower in their friendship with their big business friends. They quickly passed the military appropriation bill for the 1959 fiscal year, and even broke the rules to allocate more than 40 billion US dollars for the expenses of the US Department of Defense and the three armed forces, even more than the 1.2 billion US dollars originally requested by Eisenhower. Needless to say, in this money, the salaries of the "friends" in Lebanon only account for a fraction, and the vast majority goes into the pockets of friends who are arms and other military supplies manufacturers.

    Insurance company bosses also jubilantly did not let go of the opportunity and sent people to fly to Lebanon; of course, they did not go there as "friends" like the American soldiers, but—in the words of a representative of an insurance company—"to implement President Eisenhower's instructions—to vigorously promote them ("war insurance policies") to cure this recession."

    Flour mill bosses also fully utilized the difficult period of American soldiers in Lebanon to make a fortune. They made huge profits from speculative grain trading, which caused the Chicago grain market to experience the biggest fluctuations in several months, and the prices of all grains rose.

    The difficulties experienced by American soldiers in Lebanon and the jubilation of the American president's big business friends form a very sharp contrast. How can this situation enable American soldiers to understand those sweet words that the American president told them on July 19? Are they being "invited" to be "friends"? Or are they being sent to endure difficulties for the profits of Eisenhower's friends? For whose sake, after all? This is indeed a new question that Eisenhower should answer to the American soldiers in Lebanon.

    究竟是为了谁？
    施旅
    在美国侵略部队登陆黎巴嫩的第四天（7月19日），艾森豪威尔为了回答在黎巴嫩的美国大兵所提出的“他们不知道他们为什么到那里去”这一问题，曾经从他的办公室里向那些在滚烫的黎巴嫩海滩上的美国大兵们发表了一篇广播演说。在这篇演说中，这位美国总统对那些心神不安的美国大兵说什么“你们是去帮助黎巴嫩人民保持自由的”，但又不能不说，“当你们在黎巴嫩的时候”“对你们大家说来这将是一段困难的时期”。现在，离这位美国总统说那番话的日子已有十多天，是有“一段时期”了；在这段“时期”中，如果说那些美国大兵们对他们的“帮助黎巴嫩人民保持自由”的使命还莫名其妙的话，那末，他们对艾森豪威尔所说的“这将是一段困难的时期”，却是颇有体会了。
    譬如说，按照艾森豪威尔的说法，这些美国大兵是被邀请“作为朋友到那里（黎巴嫩）去的”，然而，黎巴嫩人民却并不欢迎这些“朋友”，相反的，却要这些“朋友”早点滚回去；他们不是向“朋友”献鲜花，而是向“朋友”扔手榴弹；不是享“朋友”以香槟酒，而是享“朋友”以会爆炸的汽水。这自然使那些做“朋友”的不能不感到非常困难。这还是指白天而言，一到黑夜，“朋友”们就不仅是处在“困难的时期”，简直就是处在神经衰弱的时期，以致已经开枪打死了两名自己人，外加一头骡子！
    然而，正当美国的大兵们在黎巴嫩经历着“一段困难的时期”的时候，艾森豪威尔的朋友们却因此而正在经历着一段兴高采烈的时期。
    当伊拉克革命成功的那一天，美国各石油公司的股票在市场上大跌，成为美联社所形容的“今年跌得最惨的一天”。人们不必迎面目睹，也可以想像到艾森豪威尔的那些石油企业朋友们的一副愁眉苦脸相。然而，不过二十四小时，艾森豪威尔为了他的朋友们能够继续每年从中东掠取十亿美元以上的纯利，把美国大兵派到黎巴嫩去承受困难了，于是，石油股票猛涨，愁眉苦脸顿转眉飞色舞。
    艾森豪威尔的其他大企业朋友的兴高采烈的程度也不下于他的石油业的朋友。美国钢铁工业杂志“钢业”兴奋地宣布：中东危机大大帮助了钢铁工业克服它的衰退，在好几个月销路不佳以后，汽车订货单突然增加。美国道格拉斯飞机公司抓住机会赶忙派人到日本去开设新公司，据说中东有可能成为第二个朝鲜，日本又将成为美国的军需供应基地了。美国参议员们对他们的大企业朋友的友情也不落后于艾森豪威尔，他们很快地通过了1959财政年度的军事拨款法案，而且还打破常规，规定拨出四百多亿美元作为美国国防部和三军的费用，甚至比艾森豪威尔原来要求的还多十二亿美元以上。不用说，这笔钱里，黎巴嫩的“朋友”们的薪饷只占一个零头，绝大部分是跑到军火和其他军需品制造商这些朋友的荷包里去了。
    保险公司老板也兴高采烈地不放过机会，派人飞到黎巴嫩；他们当然不是跟美国大兵一样去到那里作“朋友”的，而是——用一家保险公司的代表自己的话来说——“执行艾森豪威尔总统的指示——向他们大力推销（“战争保险单”）来医治这次衰退”。
    面粉厂老板也充分利用美国大兵在黎巴嫩的困难时期来大发其横财。他们大做其买空卖空的粮食投机生意，使得芝加哥的谷物市场受到好几个月以来最大的波动，所有谷物的价格都上涨了。
    美国大兵在黎巴嫩所经历的困难，和美国总统的大企业主的朋友们的兴高采烈，形成了极其鲜明的对比。这种情形，使美国大兵们怎样才能理解美国总统在7月19日告诉他们的那些甜言蜜语呢？究竟他们是被“邀请”去作“朋友”的呢？还是为了艾森豪威尔的朋友们的利润而被派去承受困难的呢？究竟是为了谁呢？这倒是艾森豪威尔应该向在黎巴嫩的美国大兵回答的一个新的问题。
