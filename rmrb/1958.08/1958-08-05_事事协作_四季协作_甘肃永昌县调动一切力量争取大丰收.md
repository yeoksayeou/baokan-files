All-round Cooperation, Seasonal Cooperation
    Yongchang County, Gansu Province, Mobilizes All Forces to Strive for a Bumper Harvest

    (Our dispatch) Since the spring of this year, Yongchang County, Gansu Province, has implemented a new organizational leadership method of "all-people cooperation, all-round cooperation, and year-round cooperation" to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production. This is an effective way to promote the great leap forward in agricultural production and specifically implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    In March and April this year, spring plowing and sowing, water conservancy construction, and afforestation in Yongchang County were all crowded together. After calculation, the county would be short of 1.2 million laborers; various tools and equipment, funds, technology, saplings, and transportation capacity could not keep up. What to do? When the Yongchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discussed this issue, there were three opinions: one advocated that fewer people do less work, doing as much as they could; the second advocated a comprehensive start, seeing what happened; the third advocated mobilizing the masses to innovate tools and implement comprehensive cooperation. After a great debate, everyone believed that the third opinion was a positive solution; the first advocacy was a right-leaning thought, a slow, poor, and wasteful route, and the meeting criticized this advocacy and resolutely adopted the third opinion, launching a comprehensive cooperation in the county between townships, between communes, between urban and rural areas, between industry and agriculture, between agriculture and animal husbandry, and between departments. In the great cooperation, no matter what region or department, whatever they could support each other with, they would support each other with, and as much as they could support, they would support.

    As a result of implementing this great cooperation, many contradictions and difficulties encountered during the spring plowing period were resolved. With a much larger workload than last year, the county's spring sowing area this year was expanded by 200,000 mu compared to last year, and it started sowing five days earlier and ended seven days earlier than last year. Since then, the Yongchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has affirmed the superiority of this method, and promoted this great cooperation in every important link of industrial and agricultural production and when central work arrives. The advantages of Yongchang County's implementation of this great cooperation are: it mobilizes all positive factors that can be utilized in the county to serve industrial and agricultural production, and solves the shortages and difficulties in labor, tools and equipment, funds, and technology that have emerged in the great leap forward; this can speed up the development of industrial and agricultural production, and facilitate the exchange of work and production experience between regions and departments; for financial and trade, health, and cultural and educational units, they also support industrial and agricultural production in the great cooperation, and carry out their own work, and are more closely integrated with practical work; in addition, in the process of this great cooperation, it also exercises and cultivates people's communist ideas, and is a vivid and concrete education for localism and the independent thinking of unwillingness to cooperate.

    事事协作　四季协作
    甘肃永昌县调动一切力量争取大丰收
    本报讯　甘肃省永昌县今年春季以来，适应农业生产大跃进的形势，实行了一种“全民大协作、事事大协作、一年四季大协作”的新的组织领导方法。这是一种促进农业生产大跃进和具体贯彻多快好省总路线的有效方式。
    今年3、4月间，永昌县春耕播种、兴修水利、植树造林都挤在一起。经过算账，全县要缺一百二十万个劳动力；各种工具设备、资金、技术、树苗、运输力都赶不上去。怎办呢？中共永昌县委在讨论这个问题时，有三种意见：一种主张人少少办事，做多少算多少；另一种主张先全面铺开，走着瞧：第三种主张发动群众革新工具，实行全面大协作。经过大辩论，大家认为：第三种意见是积极的解决办法；第一种主张是右倾思想，是少慢差费的路线，大会批判了这种主张，坚决采取了第三种意见、在全县展开乡与乡、社与社和城乡之间、工农之间、农牧之间、部门与部门之间的全面大协作。在大协作中，不论什么地区，什么部门，互相能支援什么，就支援什么，能支援多少，就支援多少。
    实行了这种大协作的结果，解决了春耕期间出现的许多矛盾和困难。在工作量比去年大得多的情况下，全县今年春耕播种面积比去年扩大了二十万亩，而且比去年提前五天开始播种，提前七天结束。从此，中共永昌县委会肯定了这种方法的优越性，在每一个工农业生产的重要环节和中心工作到来以后，都推行这种大协作。永昌县实行这种大协作的好处是：通过这种大协作调动了全县一切可以利用的积极因素，为工农业生产服务，解决了大跃进中出现的劳力、工具设备、资金、技术等方面的不足和困难；这样就可以加快工农业生产的开展速度，便于交流地区之间、部门之间的工作和生产上的经验；对于财贸、卫生，文教等单位，也在大协作中，既支援了工农业生产，又开展了本身的工作，并且和实际工作更紧密地结合起来；此外，在这种大协作的过程中，也锻炼、培养了人们的共产主义思想，对本位主义、不愿协作的单干思想，是一种生动具体的教育。　（马林周）
