Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. Since the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau launched its work of finding addresses for relatives and friends for the masses, it has helped 2,200 people find their relatives and friends in half a year.

As long as the people the masses want to find are registered residents of this city, the Public Security Bureau can find them.

Among the 2,200 people who have been reunited with their relatives and friends with the help of the Public Security Bureau, the vast majority were forced to become displaced and scattered in the old society, or were revolutionary cadres who were persecuted by the reactionaries and had not heard from their families for a long time before liberation. Some of them used to run around looking for their relatives and suffered for a long time, and some even shed a lot of tears because of this. Now, they only need to go to the police station and explain the name, gender, approximate age, and place of origin of the person they are looking for, or write a letter from other places to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inquire, and they can get the detailed address of their relatives and friends, and can contact or reunite with their relatives and friends. For example, Jiang Zhiwei, a female worker at the Beijing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, was given away by her father because of poverty when she was a child (during the Japanese rule). Later, she was sold by others again. Father and daughter had been missing each other for fourteen years. Now, the Public Security Bureau has reunited them.

Many of the masses who have found their relatives and friends have written letters or thanked the staff of the Public Security Bureau and the police stations in person. Zhang Changyu, a teacher, wrote a letter saying that the Public Security Bureau enabled him to meet his sister who had been separated for seventeen years, and he was very grateful. He said that the old society separated them, but the new society reunited them. He will resolutely defend the new society.

    旧社会逼得人骨肉分离  新社会帮助人亲友团聚
    北京市公安局帮助二千多人找到了亲友
    新华社8日讯  北京市公安局开展为群众查找亲友地址工作以来，半年中已帮助二千二百多人找到了亲人和朋友。
    群众要查找的人只要是在本市有户口的，公安局就可以找到。
    在公安局帮助下已经找到亲友的二千二百多人中，绝大部分都是在旧社会被生活逼得流离失散的人，或者是在解放前被反动派迫害和家人长期不通音信的革命干部。其中有些人过去为寻找亲人四处奔走，长期苦恼，还有些人因此掉了不少的眼泪。现在他们只是到派出所说明要找的人姓名、性别、大概年纪、什么地方人，或从外地写信给本市公安局打听一下，就可以得到亲友的详细地址，可以和亲友联系或团聚。如北京染织一厂女工姜志伟小时（日本统治时期）因为生活穷苦，父亲把她送给了人家，后来她又被别人卖掉，十四年来父女俩人彼此下落不明，现在，公安局使她们父女团聚了。
    已找到亲友的许多群众写信或当面向公安局、派出所的工作人员道谢。一个当教员的张长玉来信说，公安局使他和失散了十七年的妹妹相会，他非常感激。他说，旧社会使他们骨肉分离，新社会使他们重新团聚。他要坚决保卫新社会。
