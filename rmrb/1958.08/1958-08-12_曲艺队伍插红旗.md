Inserting Red Flags in Performing Arts Troupes
Han Qixiang is overjoyed, laughing heartily, the performing arts festival opens in the capital, surpassing the Queen Mother's Peach Banquet, better than the Eight Immortals crossing the sea. Different accents sing the same song, all singing the praises of the beautiful socialist landscape! Gold-lettered signs, silver-lettered signs, are not as good as the General Line giving gold medals to performing arts; write more, sing more, go up into the mountains more, let the red flowers of performing arts bloom everywhere. Blooming red flowers, bearing fragrant fruits, the performing arts community plants red flags!

　　曲艺队伍插红旗
　　韩起祥喜开怀，笑开怀，曲艺会演大会在首都开，胜过王母蟠桃会，赛过八仙来过海。不同的口音同歌唱，都把社会主义美景唱起来！金字牌，银字牌，不如总路线给曲艺挂金牌，多编多唱多上山，曲艺红花遍地开，开红花，结香果，曲艺界队伍把红旗栽！
