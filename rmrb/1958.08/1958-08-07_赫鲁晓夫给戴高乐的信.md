To Prime Minister De Gaulle:

In your reply to my letter to you of July 28, you informed me that the French government agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to convene a summit meeting to discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East.

We must point out that U.S. President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan have both disagreed with convening a five-nation summit meeting to discuss the aforementioned issue, and they have suggested holding a Security Council meeting.

Thus, we are now faced with the fact that the major powers do not have a unanimous opinion on convening a summit meeting. Due to the policy pursued by the United States, and supported by Britain and certain other countries, the Security Council in its current form has proven unable to resolve the task of eliminating armed aggression in the Near and Middle East.

From the very beginning of the U.S. aggression against Lebanon and the British aggression against Jordan, the Soviet Union condemned this aggression and warned that Iraq and other countries in the Arab East faced the danger of armed intervention, suggesting an immediate five-nation summit meeting including the Soviet Union, France, the United States, Britain and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, in order to immediately take measures to eliminate the situation endangering peace that has arisen in the Near and Middle East.

Although the U.S. and British governments made it impossible to convene the five-nation meeting, it can now be stated with certainty that the peoples of all countries demanding the immediate convening of such a meeting to stop armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and the peace-loving countries determined to stop aggression in the Near and Middle East, have forced the armed interventionists, at this stage, not to expand their aggression to other countries, primarily the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. Therefore, it is no accident that Western countries, including the United States and Britain, have had to recognize the Republic of Iraq, which the aggressors had initially regarded the birth of the Republic of Iraq as a threat to peace in the Near and Middle East.

However, this does not mean that the danger of escalating and exacerbating the conflict in this region has been eliminated, or that the security of the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries has been guaranteed. As everyone knows, the aggressor troops have not yet withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan. Furthermore, U.S. and British troops are constantly being deployed to this region, and the Baghdad Pact countries are implementing new military measures.

The question of completely stopping armed intervention in the Near and Middle East and creating conditions there to protect the people of this region from foreign intervention remains an urgent matter to be resolved. Foreign troops should immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, because their presence there constantly threatens the peace and independence of all countries, which is an extremely blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, and no member of the United Nations can tolerate this. Therefore, the Soviet Union firmly demands that these troops immediately withdraw from the aforementioned countries. This demand is supported by all peace-loving people.

The situation now is this: the Security Council – as experience has shown, and as you yourself know – is unable to resolve the problem of eliminating the military conflict in the Near and Middle East, and convening a summit meeting to resolve this problem has been thwarted by the negative attitude of the United States and Britain, preventing us from reaching an agreement. In this situation, what is the way out? The Soviet Union believes that an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly must be convened to study and resolve the issue of the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan. To this end, the Soviet government has instructed its permanent representative to the United Nations to request an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss this issue.

The Soviet government hopes that discussing this issue in the United Nations General Assembly, where both large and small countries are represented, will make it possible to find a way to eliminate the danger of war caused by the actions of the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East, and to bring peace to this region.

Prime Minister, I think you will agree with me that, given that the events in the Near and Middle East threaten the world with a world war that would bring endless disasters to the peoples of all countries, a question becomes particularly acute: how to establish conditions for peaceful coexistence between countries and eliminate the "cold war" that poisons the entire international situation. The Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries are striving for a day when no major power can carry out aggression, including against small countries. Therefore, major powers should reach an agreement not to take actions that put mankind on the brink of war.

The Soviet government believes that every effort should be made to develop contacts and communication between the leaders of all countries. Direct contact between national leaders can ease the current tensions, help build trust and understanding between countries, and accelerate the melting of the ice of the "cold war". We attach great importance to such contacts, and as you know, we proposed a high-level meeting of national leaders as early as last December. We believe that convening the kind of high-level meeting we previously proposed, with the joint efforts of all participating member states, will help find ways and means to eliminate the "cold war" and prevent a hot war from breaking out.

Let us do everything necessary to ensure that such a meeting, which the people of all countries eagerly await, is not postponed indefinitely. We look forward to your agreement with our proposal to convene a high-level meeting, and we are willing to participate in this meeting at any time. Convening a top-level meeting as soon as possible is in the interests of all large and small countries.

Finally, I hope that the French government will support the proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, as this is a good step towards easing tensions and will lay the foundation for accelerating the convening of a high-level meeting.

                With respect,
                      N. Khrushchev
            Moscow, August 5, 1958

### 赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐的信

1958-08-07

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐的信总理先生：
    您在答复我7月28日给您的信件的回信中，通知我说，法国政府同意苏联政府关于召开政府首脑会议讨论中近东局势的建议。
    我们不得不指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔先生和英国首相麦克米伦先生都不同意召开五国政府首脑会议讨论上述问题，他们建议举行安理会会议。
    这样一来，我们现在就面临着这样一个事实：大国对召开政府首脑会议没有一致意见。由于美国所执行的、并且得到英国和某些其他国家支持的政策，目前形式的安理会表明，它至今不能解决消除对中近东的武装侵略的任务。
    从美国侵略黎巴嫩、英国侵略约旦一开始，苏联就谴责这种侵略，并且警告说，伊拉克和阿拉伯东方其他国家面临武装干涉的危险，建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、法、美、英、印五国政府首脑会议，以便立即采取措施消除在中近东所产生的危害和平的局面。
    虽然美英政府使五国会议的召开成为不可能，但是，现在可以十分肯定地说，各国人民要求立即召开这种会议以停止对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，爱好和平的国家决心制止对中近东的侵略，这都迫使武装干涉者在现阶段没有把侵略扩大到其他国家、首先是伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国。因此，西方国家，其中包括美国和英国，不得不承认伊拉克共和国，这并不是偶然的。而当初侵略者曾把伊拉克共和国的诞生看作是对中近东和平的威胁。
    但是，这并不是说，在这一地区冲突扩大和尖锐化的危险已经消除，伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的安全得到了保障。大家知道，侵略军至今没有撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。此外，美国和英国军队不断地开到这一地区，巴格达条约国家正在实行着新的军事措施。
    关于彻底停止对中近东的武装干涉以及在那里创造条件使这一地区人民免受外国干涉的问题仍然急待解决。外国军队应该立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，因为它们驻扎在那里就经常威胁着各国人民的和平和独立，这是极其粗暴地破坏联合国宪章，联合国的任何一个会员国都不能够对此容忍。因此，苏联坚决要求这些军队立刻撤出上述国家。这个要求受到一切爱好和平的人民的支持。
    现在形成了这样的情况：安全理事会——经验表明，您自己也知道——是没有能力解决消除中近东军事冲突的问题的，而召开政府首脑会议来解决这个问题，又因为美国和英国采取了否定的态度而使我们不能达成协议。在这种情况下，出路何在呢？苏联认为，必须召开联合国大会紧急会议来研究和解决美国军队立刻撤出黎巴嫩、英国军队立刻撤出约旦的问题。为此，苏联政府指示它驻联合国的常任代表要求召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论这一问题。
    苏联政府希望，在大小国家都有代表的联合国大会上讨论这个问题，将使得有可能找寻途径来消除由于美英两国的行动在中近东造成的战争危险，并使这一地区安宁。
    总理先生，我想，您会同意我这样一种意见：鉴于中近东事件使世界面临对各国人民有无穷灾难的世界大战的威胁，这样一个问题就特别尖锐，即如何建立各国和平共处的条件和消除毒害整个国际局势的“冷战”。苏联和所有爱好和平的国家都在争取有朝一日任何大国都不能进行侵略，其中包括也不能对小国进行侵略。因此，大国应当达成协议，不采取把人类置于战争灾难边缘的行动。
    苏联政府认为，应当采取一切办法来发展各国领导人之间的接触和联系。各国领导人的直接接触可以缓和现在的紧张局势，有助于建立国与国之间的信任和了解，可以更加迅速地使“冷战”的冰块消融。我们十分重视这种接触，如您所知道的，还在去年12月我们就建议召开国家领导人高级会议。我们相信，召开我们早先所建议的那种高级会议，在参加会议的所有成员国共同努力下有助于找寻消除“冷战”状态的道路和办法，并且使热战不致于爆发。
    让我们尽一切必要的努力使各国人民所殷切盼望的这种会议不致于无限期地拖延下去。我们期待您同意我们关于召开高级会议的建议，并愿意随时参加这个会议。尽速召开最高级会议是符合一切大国和小国的利益的。
    最后我希望法国政府支持关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议，因为这是缓和紧张局势的一个很好步骤并且会给加速召开高级会议打下基础。
                此致敬意
                      尼·赫鲁晓夫
            1958年8月5日于莫斯科
