The modern dramas performed by the Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe No. 2 in Beijing are all small Yue Operas worth watching.

"Comrades on the Road of Wind and Rain" depicts the troupe going to the countryside to participate in labor and performances. An individual actress, due to her individualism, couldn't withstand the test and almost left the revolutionary ranks. Later, she saw the new life and new atmosphere in the countryside, and was moved by the communist spirit of the rural cadres wholeheartedly serving the people. She was educated and finally changed, rejoining the ranks. Because the actors have a deep understanding of this play, the performance is very vivid and has been widely welcomed by the audience.

"After the Rain" reflects the fact that in a certain village, landlords and rich peasants incited the masses to make trouble when right-wing elements attacked the Party. After a severe struggle, the wavering cadres and masses were educated and distinguished right from wrong. The actors all performed with great emotion.

"Three Ferries" cleverly praises the new people and new things in the countryside in a comedic way.

"Qiu Cai Kang" praises Comrade Qiu Cai Kang's communist spirit and boldness. In form, it can also be said to be a theatrical living newspaper.

    值得一看的小型越剧
    浙江省越剧二团在京演出的现代剧目都是值得一看的小型越剧。
    “风雨同路人”是描写剧团上山下乡参加劳动和演出的。个别演员由于存在着个人主义思想，受不了考验，几乎要离开革命队伍，后来她看到了农村的新生活和新风气，并且被农村干部全心全意为人民服务的共产主义精神所感动，受到了教育，终于转变，从新归队。这个戏由于演员有较深刻的体会，演出很生动，受到观众的普遍欢迎。
    “雨后”反映了某村地主富农乘右派分子向党进攻时煽动群众闹事，经过严重的斗争，动摇的干部和群众受到了教育，辨别了大是大非。演员演得都很有感情。
    “三摆渡”以喜剧的手法，巧妙地歌颂了农村里的新人新事。
    “丘财康”歌颂了丘财康同志的共产主义精神气魄。在形式上也可以说是戏曲的活报剧。
