(Our Newspaper Wuhan, 3rd) This reporter’s commentary on Hubei's high-yield early rice stated: Recently, Hubei's early rice has broken through the 10,000-jin mark one after another. As of now, the average yield per mu of more than 1.6 mu of land in the Chun Guang First Cooperative in Yingcheng County is 10,579 jin; the average yield per mu of more than 1.1 mu of land in the Heping Cooperative in Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County is 11,201 jin; the average yield per mu of more than 1.6 mu of land in the Huangsi Fifth Cooperative in Chaoyang Township is 13,408 jin; and the average yield per mu of more than 1.2 mu of land in the Changfeng Cooperative is 15,361 jin. The news has been exhilarating. People are saying that more and more high-yield early rice "satellites" are appearing, opening up a new historical period of high-yield rice production.

Last year, the highest yield of early rice in Hubei Province was 1,700 jin per mu. This year, on the same land and with the same people, why has the yield increased so rapidly? It is because, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, people have broken superstitions and liberated their thinking.

Since the news of the high yield of summer wheat spread, people confidently thought: Wheat, known as a low-yield crop, can yield 6,000 or 7,000 jin per mu. Rice, known as a high-yield crop, why can't it be increased even more? Thus, they put forward the slogan "Rice surpassing wheat, high yield catching up with low yield." Guan Musheng, director of the Changfeng Cooperative and a nationally renowned labor model, took the lead in setting a target of 10,000 jin per mu for his early rice experimental plot, and a wave of early rice 10,000-jin per mu experiments quickly swept across the region.

At that time, the "wait-and-see faction" and conservatives were skeptical about the 10,000-jin per mu yield of early rice. They said, "In the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, rice never exceeded 1,000 jin (per mu). Now, trying to achieve 10,000 jin is a dream!" However, people ignored these words. With soaring enthusiasm, they boldly implemented technological innovations, overcame natural disasters such as drought, and finally achieved a bumper harvest of early rice, greatly exceeding the original target of 10,000 jin. Faced with this living reality, what do the "wait-and-see faction" and conservatives think?

Perhaps some may say that these high-yield crops must be grown in particularly good fields. No! The conditions of some fields are not that good. For example, Guan Musheng's experimental field, which yielded more than 15,000 jin per mu, is a "dead horse liver soil field" (a backward field with poor soil quality). Why can such a field achieve such a high yield? The people who created the high yield said well, because they despise all hostile factors in nature, do not act as slaves of nature, believe in the great power of themselves and the collective, and believe in the principle that "if you think you want to exceed and dare to exceed, you will definitely be able to exceed." Of course, this is difficult for those who adhere to "conditions" to understand.

The high yield of early rice is not only a "wake-up call" for the "wait-and-see faction" and conservatives, but also a great inspiration for the promoters, inspiring them to further liberate their minds and push rice production from one peak to another. The bold slogan "Late rice must surpass early rice" proposed throughout the province is a clear example.

    水稻生产进入新的历史时期
    本报记者对湖北早稻高额丰产的评述
    本报武汉3日电　记者评述湖北早稻获得高额丰产称：近日来湖北早稻纷纷突破万斤大关，截至目前为止，应城县春光一社一亩六分多田平均单产一万零五百七十九斤，孝感县朋兴乡和平社一亩一分多田平均单产一万一千二百零一斤，朝阳乡黄丝五社一亩六分多田平均单产一万三千四百零八斤，长风社一亩二分多田平均单产一万五千三百六十一斤。消息传来，人心振奋，都说早稻高产“卫星”越来越多，开辟了水稻丰产的新的历史时期。
    去年湖北省早稻单产最高的是一千七百斤，今年同是那块土地还是那些人为什么产量就像飞的那样快呢？是人们在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，破除了迷信，解放了思想。
    自从夏季小麦高产的消息传出之后，人们满怀信心地想：小麦向称低产作物，还能亩产六、七千斤；水稻向称高产作物，为什么不能更加大量增产呢？于是他们提出“水稻超小麦，高产赶低产”的口号。长风社主任、全国著名劳动模范官木生首先在自己早稻试验田里订出了亩产万斤规划，各地很快掀起了早稻亩产万斤试验的浪潮。
    当时“观潮派”和保守主义者对于早稻亩产万斤是怀疑的，他们说：“唐、宋、元、明、清，没有过水稻千斤（一亩），现在要想搞万斤，梦想！”但是，人们没有理会这些话，他们以冲天的干劲，大胆实行技术革新，战胜干旱等自然灾害，终于取得早稻丰收，并且大大超过原来的规划万斤指标。面对着这个活生生的事实，“观潮派”和保守主义者作何感想？
    也许有人要说，这些高产作物，一定长在特别良好的田里。不！有些田的条件并不算好。例如亩产一万五千多斤的官木生的试验田，就是一块“死马肝土田”（土质不好的落后田）。为什么这样的田能够取得高额丰产呢？创造高额丰产的人们说得好，因为他们藐视自然界的一切敌对因素，不作自然的奴隶，相信自己和集体的伟大力量，相信“想到要超过而又敢于超过的，就一定能够超过”的道理，从而高度发挥了主观能动性，当然这些在“条件论”者说来是难以理解的。
    早稻高额丰产不仅对于“观潮派”和保守主义者是一副“清醒剂”，而且对于促进派也是很大的启发，启发他们进一步解放思想，把水稻生产从一个高峰推向另一个高峰。目前全省各地提出“晚稻定要超过早稻”的豪迈口号就是一个明显的例证。
