　　More and Better Storytelling of the Revolutionary History
　　Tao Dun
    Two programs in the performance were about stories from the period of the Land Revolution. One was the Xiangxi Fishing Drum "Little Red Army," and the other was the Fujian Jin Opera "Breaking the Prison Record." The former was about the young Little Red Army bravely killing the enemy, and the latter was about Communist Party members using a plan to break into the prison and rescue captured comrades. These two programs gave us great inspiration. The Chinese revolution, from the Opium War to the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, experienced more than a hundred years. Literary works reflect the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation relatively more. The period of the Land Revolution, and the revolutionary movements even before that, resisting imperialist aggression and overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, are less written about in artistic works. However, every period of the Chinese revolution saw earth-shattering scenes and moving stories, as well as heroic figures that shone as brightly as the sun and moon. These should all be reflected in artistic works.
    If Quyi (Chinese folk art forms including ballad singing, story telling, comic dialogues, etc.) is a form that the people love to hear and see, then Quyi should take the history of the Chinese revolution as an important subject for creation. Pinghua (storytelling) such as "Tales of the States," "Western Han," "Eastern Han," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Sui and Tang Dynasties," "Water Margin," "Generals of the Yang Family," "The Story of Yue Fei," "Great Ming Heroes," and public cases of the Qing Dynasty have written and told about almost every dynasty and every major change. After the Opium War, we can hardly find any storytelling works with the content of the democratic revolution. For example, the Taiping Rebellion, with its complex struggles and numerous characters, truly surpassed the Three Kingdoms period, the Sui and Tang dynasties, and the Water Margin figures. Moreover, this peasant revolutionary movement already had the nature of a democratic revolution, which was very different from the past. Why not write about it? Another example is the Boxer Rebellion, which is also the best subject for storytelling, but no one has started yet. As for the Land Revolution until the Long March of 25,000 Li, it was the most difficult stage of the Chinese revolution. The events are almost magical. Turning them into books to tell will have great educational significance for the younger generation who did not participate in this stage of the revolution.
    It should be said that the subject matter of Quyi is very broad. Telling traditional old stories, telling new stories reflecting modern life, and also telling the history of revolutionary struggles of the past hundred years. The blank in Quyi of the past hundred years of revolutionary struggle must be filled. Our writers and artists have already created images such as Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, Luo Cheng, and Mu Guiying, which are still circulating among the masses today. The heroic figures that have emerged in our hundred years of revolutionary struggle far surpass the ancients. Especially the leaders who are leading socialist construction today, are they not a thousand times higher than the Three Kingdoms figures and the Generals of the Yang Family? "Counting the outstanding figures, we still look to the present," this is a fact. We must tell and sing about the hardships experienced by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese revolution, and the stories of the heroes who followed one another. We must do our best to sing their praises. The writing and performance of "Little Red Army" and "Breaking the Prison Record" are a good start.

　　更多更好地说唱革命史
　　陶钝
    会演中有两个节目是写土地革命时期的故事的，一个是湘西渔鼓“小红军”，一个是福建锦歌“破监记”。前者是写年轻的小红军英勇杀敌，后者是写共产党员用计打破监狱救出被捕的同志。这两个节目给了我们很大的启发。中国革命从鸦片战争起，到1949年中华人民共和国建立，经历了一百多年，在文学作品中反映抗日战争和解放战争的比较多一些。土地革命时期，和再往前的反抗帝国主义侵略，推翻满清皇朝的革命运动，文艺作品写的却很少。可是，中国革命的每一个时期都出现了惊天动地的场面和可歌可泣的故事，以及与日月争辉的英雄人物，这些都是应当在文艺作品里反映出来的。
    如果说曲艺是人民喜闻乐见的形式，曲艺就应当把中国革命史作为创作的重要题材。评书“列国志”、“西汉”、“东汉”、“三国演义”、“隋唐”、“水浒传”、“杨家将”、“精忠说岳”、“大明英烈传”以及清朝的公案，几乎把每一个朝代，每一个大变革都写了说了。鸦片战争以后，我们几乎找不到以民主革命运动为内容的说唱作品。例如太平天国革命，斗争的复杂，人物的众多，比起三国时期，隋唐时期和水浒人物真是有过之无不及。而且这一次的农民革命运动，已经有了民主革命的性质，和以往大不相同，为什么不写呢？再如义和团运动，也是说书的最好的题材，也还没有人动手。至于土地革命直到二万五千里长征，那是中国革命最艰苦的阶段，事迹已经近乎神奇，编成书来说，对于没有参加过这个阶段革命的后一辈，更是有很大的教育意义。
    应该说，曲艺的题材是很广泛的，说传统旧书，说反映现代生活的新书，也要说近百年的革命斗争史。百年来革命斗争在曲艺的空白一定要补起来。我们的作家和艺人们已经塑造了赵云、黄忠、罗成、穆桂英这样的形象，至今还流传在群众中间。我们百年来革命斗争中出现的英雄人物远远超过古人。特别是今天正在领导社会主义建设的领袖们，不是比三国人物和杨家将高出千百倍吗？“数风流人物，还看今朝”，这是事实。共产党和毛主席领导中国革命经历的千辛万苦，和英雄们前仆后继的故事，我们要说要唱，要尽力地歌颂。“小红军”和“破监记”的写作和演出是一个良好的开端。
