Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 8th: The Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering, holding high the red flag of physical exercise, recently surpassed the Hefei Mining Institute in labor-defense system and graded athlete training, taking the national first place.

After five months of hard work, the school not only achieved 100% of healthy students (1,854 people) passing the Level 1 standard of the labor-defense system, but also 73.68% of the students reached the Level 2 standard of the labor-defense system, and 90.4% of the students have already become graded athletes. This astonishing number is still unique among national universities at present.

The Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering has been established for less than two years. Since the beginning of this year, all students and 95% of faculty and staff have participated in various sports activities, and family members of employees also engage in daily physical exercise. After students participated in the comprehensive training of the labor-defense system, their physical fitness has generally improved. In one class of the Department of Architectural Engineering, thirty-three students, originally eight suffered from insomnia due to neurasthenia, now all have recovered. Jin Congzhou, a student who had long suffered from rheumatic lumbago and insomnia, recovered after several months of exercise. He also participated in the 3,000-meter walk and reached the Level 3 athlete standard. Many students who were originally called "old sick men" and "old scholars" have now become vigorous athletes.

Through physical exercise, students have become more passionate about labor. Since April of this year, all students have participated in more than 50,000 workdays. Some students do not feel tired even after continuous labor throughout the day.

After participating in physical exercise, students are full of energy, have concentrated attention, and their academic performance has also been generally improved. In the final exams of the 1957 academic year to the first semester of the 1958 academic year, the number of students with all excellent grades increased by 6.1% compared to the previous academic year.

The school's physical exercise activities have always been closely integrated with political and ideological education. This is the fundamental reason why they have been able to popularize physical exercise and achieve significant results in a short period. Their experience is that the Party committee attaches importance to it, puts politics in command, and Party and League organizations provide guarantees at all levels. Gan Yifei, Secretary of the Party Committee and President, personally leads the physical education teaching and research group, often plays football and volleyball with students, and personally supervises the games during competitions. The Communist Youth League Committee is specifically responsible for the ideological education of students regarding physical exercise. The school makes overall arrangements for various activities and stipulates several systems to ensure that all teachers, students, and staff have a certain amount of time for physical exercise.

Following the mass line, boldly mobilizing the masses, and letting students come up with ideas is also an important experience for the school to carry out sports activities. The second is to focus on evaluation, conduct competitions, launch school-wide evaluation campaigns, have competitions every day, establish advanced banners, and hold on-site meetings to exchange and promote experience.

    运动场上争得第一
    西安建筑工程学院体育活动赶过合肥矿院
    据新华社西安8日电  西安建筑工程学院高举体育锻炼红旗，最近在劳卫制和等级运动员锻炼上，又胜过了合肥矿业学院，跃居全国第一。
    经过五个月的苦战，这个学校不但100％的健康学生（一千八百五十四人）通过了劳卫制一级标准；73.68％的学生达到了劳卫制二级标准，并已经有90.4％的学生成为等级运动员。这个惊人的数字在目前全国高等学校中还是唯一的。
    西安建筑工程学院成立还不到二年。今年以来，全校学生和95％教职工都参加了各种体育活动，职工家属也天天进行体育锻炼。学生们参加了劳卫制的全面锻炼以后，体质普遍增强。建筑工程系一个班三十三人，原来八人因患神经衰弱而失眠，现在全部好了。长期患着风湿性腰背神经痛和失眠症的学生靳从周经过几个月的锻炼，病都好了。他还参加三千公尺竞走，达到了三级运动员标准。许多原来被称为“老病号”和“老夫子”的学生，现在也都成了朝气蓬勃的运动员。
    通过体育锻炼，学生们更加热爱劳动。今年4月以来全校学生共参加了五万多个劳动日，有些学生整天连续劳动也不感觉到疲劳。
    学生们参加体育锻炼后，精力充沛，注意力集中，学业成绩也得到普遍提高。1957年度到1958年度上学年期终测验，全部优秀成绩的学生比上学年增加了6.1％。
    这个学校的体育锻炼活动，始终是和政治思想教育密切结合的。这是他们所以能在短时期内普及体育锻炼取得重大成绩的根本原因。他们的经验是党委重视，政治挂帅，党团组织层层保证。党委书记兼院长甘一飞亲自领导体育教研组，经常和学生一起踢足球、打排球，竞赛活动时就亲自到场督战。团委专门负责学生关于体育锻炼的思想教育工作。学校统筹安排各项活动，规定若干制度，使全体师生员工有一定体育锻炼时间。
    走群众路线，放手发动群众，让学生想办法，这也是这个学校开展体育活动的重要经验。其次是抓评比，搞竞赛，展开全校性的评比运动，天天有竞赛，树立先进旗帜，召开现场会议，交流推广经验。
