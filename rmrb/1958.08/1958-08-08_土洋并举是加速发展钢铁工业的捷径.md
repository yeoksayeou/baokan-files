    Utilizing Both Native and Foreign Methods is a Shortcut to Accelerating the Development of the Steel Industry

    In the past month or two, provinces and cities across the country have successively convened local industrial conferences or iron and steel industry conferences, dispelling the mystique surrounding the iron and steel industry, establishing the "marshal" status of the iron and steel industry, and formulating leap-forward plans and measures for the development of the iron and steel industry, sounding the clarion call for the entire party and all the people to march towards the iron and steel industry. A new high tide of industrial construction, with steel as the key and driving the comprehensive development of industry, has taken shape. The days when converters and blast furnaces bloom everywhere, and molten steel and iron flow everywhere, are about to arrive. The plan to build 200 small and medium-sized converters within a year, increasing steel production by 10 million tons, and to build more than 13,000 small and medium-sized blast furnaces within a year, increasing iron production by 20 million tons, can not only be completed 100%, but will also be greatly exceeded.

    The iron and steel industry is the foundation of all industries and national economic development, and the pillar of our happy life. To transfer the entire national economy to the technical basis of modern large-scale production, to realize the mechanization of labor, to realize the electrification of urban and rural areas, to industrialize the entire country, and to establish a comprehensive transportation and postal and telecommunications network based on modern tools throughout the country, all require iron and steel. At the same time, various industrial sectors are interconnected and interact with each other. On the one hand, the development of various industries must be based on the iron and steel industry; on the other hand, the development of the iron and steel industry, in turn, promotes the development of other industries, such as coal, electricity, machinery, petroleum, chemical industries, and transportation. If the development speed of the iron and steel industry is fast, other industries will also follow suit; if the development speed of the iron and steel industry is slow, other industries will also follow suit. If the entire industry is composed of a network, then the iron and steel industry is the key to this network. By grasping this key, the entire industry can be driven forward.

    Can China's iron and steel industry develop at the highest speed, for example, with an annual output growth rate of not a few percent, a dozen percent, or even a few tens of percent, but 100 percent or even higher? The answer is: the possibility exists, and the question is whether we want or need high speed? If we want it, we will have it; if we don't want it, we won't have it. Some may say, "If you want high speed, you will have high speed. Is this a bit of idealistic detachment from reality?" We say that there is no idealism here at all, but it is completely based on reality and has a basis. There are two main aspects to the reality and basis mentioned here. First, China is rich in mineral resources. Steelmaking requires a lot of coal, and among the more than 2,000 counties in China, more than 1,500 have coal; the raw material for iron and steel—iron ore—had proven reserves of 5.6 billion tons during the first five-year plan period. Second, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "Introducing a Cooperative," we have the leadership of the Party and 600 million people, which is a decisive factor. People are the most active factor in the productive forces. The more people, the greater the power. The people describe their power like this: "When we stomp our feet, the earth trembles; when we breathe, the rolling river makes way; when we raise our hands, the towering mountains are afraid; when we take a step, no one dares to stop us; we are the working people, and our power is invincible."
    (Folk song of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1) This invincible power of 600 million people, under the guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism, is bursting out with the momentum of rushing into the sky and the power of thunder. They can not only win a bumper harvest of grain in a drought year, but also start factories, find mineral deposits, open mines, and build railways. Therefore, high speed is an objective existence, and demanding high-speed development is a correct reflection of people's objective existence. It can be said that the very demand for high-speed development of industry is a driving force to stimulate the enthusiasm of 600 million people.

    However, to turn the possibility of high-speed development into reality, we must also conscientiously implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small sizes and combining "native" and "foreign" methods. On this issue, people's understanding is not completely consistent. Most people advocate that in the development of local iron and steel industry, the construction of small and "native" ones should be the focus at present, with large and medium-sized ones being built with emphasis. A few people advocate building large and medium-sized ones as the main focus, but are not interested in small "native" ones and are not very enthusiastic, saying that they are too backward. Some places are willing to build small ones, but not willing to build native ones. This is building small but foreign ones. But small but foreign is not economical. This is a debate about two different construction methods.

    We agree with the view that small and "native" should be the main focus. Large and medium-sized modern steel plants do have many advantages, but they require a lot of investment, complete sets of modern equipment and building materials (mainly steel), a lot of technical backbone, and a relatively long construction time, so they must be run by the central government or provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. At present, it is impossible to hold them universally. Therefore, it is not realistic to propose that the construction of large and medium-sized modern enterprises should be the main focus. Small and "native" iron-making furnaces and steel-making furnaces are indeed technically backward compared with large and medium-sized modern steel plants, but they have advantages that modern steel plants do not have. That is, less investment, simple equipment, technology that is easy for the masses to master, and short construction time. With small and "native" as the main focus, we can mobilize the entire Party and all the people to run the iron and steel industry at the present time when there is a shortage of technical backbone, insufficient steel supply, modern equipment cannot be supplied, and funds are not very abundant. In places with resources, not only can the metallurgical industry department run them, but all industrial departments can run them; not only factories can run them, but also government agencies, troops, schools, street offices, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives can run them; soon it will be possible to see blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters blooming everywhere, and molten steel and iron flowing everywhere. The blooming of small blast furnaces and converters is very conducive to the characteristics of China's vast territory and dispersed resources, which can enable the economy of various parts of the country to develop more balanced. Quantitative change is the beginning of qualitative change, and the total output must be large if there are more small ones. Although a small furnace does not produce much steel and iron, tens of thousands of small furnaces can produce a torrent of steel. For example, relying on the strength of the masses, Henan Province can build more than 30,000 native blast furnaces and simple small blast furnaces this year, and the iron-making capacity can reach 4 million tons, which is equivalent to the current pig iron output of Anshan Iron and Steel! We don't say that every province and autonomous region will build so many small furnaces, but let's say that a quarter of the provinces and autonomous regions do it, wouldn't that be equivalent to China having seven more Anshan Iron and Steel Plants? Wouldn't the day when China's steel production catches up with Britain be greatly advanced?

    We advocate that small and "native" ones should be the main focus at present, but of course we do not exclude the simultaneous construction of large and medium-sized modern steel plants. Modern steel plants are efficient and have low costs. The purpose of our technological revolution is to transfer the entire national economy (including the iron and steel industry) to the track of modern technology. In fact, China is now starting to build large-scale iron and steel joint enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel, and various provinces are also building or preparing to build a number of medium-sized iron and steel enterprises with emphasis. And the ultimate goal of our technological revolution is to realize the large-scale modern production. However, this is not contradictory to the combination of large, medium, and small sizes. What are the benefits of small and native ones for various localities? The construction of small and native blast furnaces and converters can produce enough steel needed to manufacture modern equipment for us, can produce building materials needed for the construction of modern enterprises, and can accumulate funds and cultivate technical forces for modern enterprises. With equipment, materials, funds, and technical forces, we can expand the construction scale of modern steel enterprises, thus making it possible to replace the current native and small blast furnaces and converters with modern steel enterprises. This is the dialectical law that small contains large, native contains "foreign"; small produces large, native produces "foreign," and it is also the dialectical law of the general development of things from nothing to something, from small to large, from low to high. Some people look down on "small" and "native," which shows that they have not yet understood this dialectical law. However, in order to implement the Party's general line, those who are not interested in small and native ones should quickly understand this principle, otherwise it will be detrimental to socialist construction.

### 土洋并举是加速发展钢铁工业的捷径

    土洋并举是加速发展钢铁工业的捷径
    最近一两个月来，全国各省市先后召开了地方工业会议或钢铁工业会议，打掉了对钢铁工业的神秘思想，确立了钢铁工业的“元帅”地位，订出了发展钢铁工业的跃进规划和措施，吹起了全党全民向钢铁工业大进军的号角。一个以钢为纲，带动工业全面发展的工业建设的新高潮已经形成。转炉高炉遍地开花，钢水铁水到处奔流的日子，即将到来。要在一年内建成二百座中小型转炉，增加一千万吨钢，以及要在一年内建成一万三千多座中小型高炉，增加二千万吨铁的计划，不仅可以百分之百地完成，而且将大大超过。
    钢铁工业是一切工业和国民经济发展的基础，是我们幸福生活的支柱。要把全国经济都转到现代化大生产的技术基础上来，要实现劳动机械化，要实现城乡电气化，要使全国工业化，要在全国范围内建立一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的运输网和邮电网，在在都需要钢铁。同时，各个工业部门之间又是互相联系互相作用着的，一方面，各种工业的发展要以钢铁工业为基础，另一方面，钢铁工业的发展，又反过来推动其他工业，例如煤炭、电力、机械、石油、化学等工业和交通运输的发展。钢铁工业的发展速度快，其他工业也跟着快；钢铁工业的发展速度慢，其他工业也跟着慢。如果说，整个工业组成一个网的话，那末，钢铁工业就是这个网的纲。纲举目张，抓住了这条纲，就可以把整个工业带动起来。
    我国钢铁工业能不能以最高的速度，比如说，每年产量的增长率不是百分之几、百分之十几或者百分之几十，而百分之百甚至更高的比例发展呢？答曰：可能性是存在着的，问题是我们想不想、要不要高速度？我们想要，就有；不想要，就没有。也许会有人说：“要高速度就有高速度，是否有点脱离实际的唯心主义味道呢？”我们说，这里一点也没有唯心论，而是完全从实际出发，是有根据的。这里讲的实际和根据主要有两个。第一，是我国矿产资源丰富。炼铁需要大量的煤，而在我国二千多个县中，就有一千五百多个县有煤；钢铁的原料——铁矿石，在第一个五年计划期间，探明的铁矿储量已达五十六亿吨。第二，就是毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”一文中指出的：我们有党的领导和六亿人民，这是一个决定的因素。人是生产力的最活跃因素。人多力量大。人民是这样形容自己的力量的：“我们一跺脚，大地震动；我们吹口气，滚滚河水让路；我们一举手，巍峨大山胆寒；我们一迈腿，谁也不敢阻挡；我们是劳动人民，我们的力量无敌。”
    （上钢一厂民歌）六亿人民的这个无敌力量，在党的建设社会主义总路线的指导下，正以气冲牛斗之势，雷霆万钧之力奔放出来。他们不仅可以在大旱之年争得粮食大丰收，还可以动手办工厂，找矿藏，开矿山，修铁路。因此，高速度是客观存在，要求高速度发展，正是人们对客观存在的正确反映。完全可以这样说，要求高速度地发展工业的本身，就是一种激发六亿人民积极性的动力。
    可是要把高速度发展的可能性变成现实，还必须认真贯彻大中小相结合、“土”“洋”相结合的方针。在这个问题上，现在人们的认识还不是完全一致的。大多数人主张在发展地方钢铁工业中，目前应该以建设小的“土”的为主，有重点地建设大型的和中型的。少数人则主张以建设大型的、中型的为主，而对于小的“土”的不感兴趣，积极性不高，说它们太落后了。有的地方愿意搞小的，但不愿搞土的。这就是搞小而洋的。但小而洋是并不经济的。这是两条不同的建设方法的争论。
    我们赞成以小和“土”为主的主张。大型的中型的现代化钢铁厂的确具有很多优点，但是，建设起来却要很多投资，很多成套的现代设备和建筑材料（主要是钢材），要很多技术骨干，要比较长的建设时间，因此非要中央或省、市、自治区来办不可。目前，是不可能普遍举办的。所以，提出以建设大型的、中型的现代企业为主，是不现实的。小的“土”的炼铁炉、炼钢炉，比起大型的和中型的现代化钢铁厂来，技术的确是落后的，但是却具有现代钢铁厂所没有的优点。这就是投资少、设备简单、技术容易为群众所掌握、建设时间短。以小型的和“土”的为主，我们就可以在目前技术骨干缺乏、钢材供应不足、现代设备供应不上、资金也不十分充裕的情况下，发动全党全民来办钢铁工业。在有资源的地方，不仅冶金工业部门可以办，而且所有的工业部门都可以办；不仅工厂可以办；而且机关、部队、学校、街道、手工业合作社、农业合作社都可以办；很快就可以做到高炉、平炉、转炉遍地开花，钢水铁水到处奔流。小高炉转炉遍地开花，非常有利于我国幅员广大、资源分散的特点，可以使全国各地经济能够比较平衡地发展。量变是质变的开始，小的多了总产量就一定大。一个小炉子炼出的钢和铁虽然不多，但是一万个几万个小炉子炼出来的就可以汇成滔滔的钢铁洪流。例如，河南省依靠群众力量，今年可以建成三万多个土高炉和简易小高炉，炼铁能力可以达到四百万吨，相当于现在鞍钢的生铁产量！我们不说每一个省和自治区都建成这么多小炉子，只说有四分之一的省和自治区做到吧，那不就等于我国多有七个鞍钢了吗？我国钢铁产量赶上英国的日子，不就可以大大提前了吗？
    我们主张当前以小的“土”的为主，当然并不排斥同时建设大型的和中型的现代化钢铁厂。现代化的钢铁厂效率高，成本低，我们进行技术革命的目的，就是为了把全国经济（包括钢铁工业在内）统统转到现代化技术的轨道上来的。事实上，现在我国也正在着手建设武钢、包钢等大型钢铁联合企业，各省也正在有重点地建设或筹备建设一批中型钢铁企业。而我们技术革命的最终的目标也是要实现洋的即现代化的大生产。然而这和大中小相结合一点也不矛盾，对各地方来说，以小的和土的为主有什么好处呢？土的小的高炉转炉建设起来，可以为我们生产足够的制造现代设备所需要的钢材，可以生产建设现代企业所需要的建筑材料，可以为现代企业积累资金和培养技术力量。有了设备、材料、资金和技术力量，我们就可以扩大现代钢铁企业的建设规模，这样也就有条件实现以现代的钢铁企业来代替现在的土的和小的高炉和转炉。这就是小里有大，土里有“洋”；小中出大，土中出“洋”的辩证规律，也是一般事物从无到有，从小到大，从低级到高级发展的辩证规律。有些人看不起“小”和“土”，说明他们还没有懂得这个辩证规律。可是为了贯彻党的总路线，那些对小的土的不感兴趣的人应当很快地弄明白这个道理，否则对社会主义建设是不利的。（附图片）
