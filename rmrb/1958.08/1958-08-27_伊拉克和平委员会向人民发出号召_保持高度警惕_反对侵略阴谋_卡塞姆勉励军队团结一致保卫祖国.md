The statement said, "We warmly welcome the declarations made by the revolutionary leaders, which prove their adherence to a policy of opposing imperialism, serving peace, strengthening solidarity among Arab countries, and establishing relations with other countries on the basis of equality."

The statement strongly condemned imperialist aggression against the Arab East and the actions of the US and British troops in occupying Lebanon and Jordan. It pointed out, "We are watching with great indignation the acts of aggression that are in fact directed against the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. While reminding the people to be prudent, we also ask them to be vigilant and declare that we are fully prepared to defend our motherland against imperialist aggression."

He delivered a speech to the officers and soldiers, praising the Iraqi Army's heroic feats in the recent revolution. He pointed out that this revolution has transformed the Iraqi nation into a free and dignified nation.

Qasim said that this freedom and dignity require the Iraqi Army to continue to carry out arduous work, require them to have good training and high military capabilities, and to unite as a disciplined force, a force capable of destroying all obstacles in its path.

Qasim said that the establishment of the Republic of Iraq is for it to survive courageously and forge ahead. We have shattered the shackles and opened the door, we cannot look back, we must survive, and we must shed our last drop of blood for this nation and for this motherland.
