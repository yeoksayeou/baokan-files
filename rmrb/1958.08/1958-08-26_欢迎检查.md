　　Welcome Inspection
　　Jiang Hao
　　In the past two days, many colorful slogans have been posted in the streets and alleys of Beijing: "Welcome the Central, Shanghai, and Tianjin Health Inspection Teams," "Our institute (household, street) is basically 'four-free' and 'three-clean,' welcome inspection." The people of Beijing are welcoming the health inspection teams with the joy of a festival.
　　Why do the people of Beijing have such a mood? On the one hand, they have made great achievements in the hygiene movement and dare to invite others to inspect. On the other hand, they want to plant red flags on the front line of eliminating the four pests. They propose: "Double leap forward in production and hygiene, vow to plant the red flag in Beijing."
　　This is just the situation in Beijing. Shanghai and Tianjin are the same, with cheers for inspection everywhere. This is a new ideological outlook of the working people. They dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, to plant the red flag even higher, and to make it even better. Inspection is no longer a passive measure, but rather an inspiring force to raise higher fighting spirit and beat louder drums. In short, inspection has been transformed into a driving force for work. Beijing launched a "four-free" and "three-clean" crash week campaign a week before the official start of the inspection. During this crash week, mass inspections and red flag planting/white flag removal campaigns were first carried out within each household, each courtyard, each street, each unit, and each area. This enabled some units that were originally hygiene red flag units to hold the red flag even higher, and enabled a few units with poor hygiene conditions to remove the white flag and plant the red flag, in order to accelerate the development of the city's elimination of the four pests movement, to welcome the great inspection.
　　Since the launch of the elimination of the four pests movement throughout the country last winter, counties and cities have been conducting inspections within their respective regions since around the Spring Festival. Some units have also developed a system of regular inspections. Since the launch of competitions between provinces and cities, some provinces and cities have also sent representatives to visit each other. All these inspections of different scales and forms have played a role in exchanging valuable experiences and further promoting the patriotic health movement. Now that the movement is advancing towards the goal of basically achieving four-free provinces and cities and eliminating the four pests nationwide, there is an even greater need for national inspections to make the people's enthusiasm for eliminating the four pests grow stronger, and their confidence grow stronger, so as to promote the accelerated progress of the national elimination of the four pests movement.
　　Inspection is one of the important methods to ensure the realization of each task. A task will have a goal only if it has a plan, and whether this plan is implemented and how well it is implemented must be discovered and resolved through timely inspections. The method of combining the dispatch of delegations from above with the mobilization of the masses from below, as practiced in Beijing and other places, further widely and deeply publicizes and mobilizes the masses and exchanges experiences in the preparation for inspection and during the inspection process, which can more fully stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses.
　　We hope that the health work will be greatly advanced in this inspection of the three cities.

　　欢迎检查
　　江浩
    近两天来，北京市的大街小巷里都张贴了许多五颜六色的标语：“欢迎中央、上海和天津卫生参观检查团”、“本院（户、街道）基本‘四无’‘三洁’，欢迎检查”。北京市民怀着节日的心情，欢迎着卫生参观检查团。
    北京人民为什么会有这样的心情呢？他们在卫生运动中作出了巨大的成绩，敢于邀请别人来检查，这是一方面；另一个方面则是他们要在除四害战线上插红旗。他们提出：“生产卫生双跃进，誓把红旗插北京”。
    这只是北京一个地方的情况，上海天津也是如此，到处是一片欢呼检查声，这是劳动人民新的思想面貌，他们敢想、敢说、敢干，要把红旗插得更高，好了还要更好。检查不再是消极的被动的措施，而是鼓起更高的斗志，敲起更响的锣鼓。总之，把检查变成了一种推动工作的动力。北京早在正式开始检查一周以前，就展开了“四无”“三洁”的突击周运动。在这个突击周里，首先在各户以及各院各街道各单位各地区之内，展开了群众性的检查和插红旗拔白旗运动。使一些原来是卫生红旗单位把红旗举得更高，使少数原来卫生情况不好的单位，拔了白旗插上红旗，以加速全市除四害运动的开展，来迎接大检查。
    全国各地自去冬开展除四害运动以来，从春节前后起，各县、市就在本地区范围内进行检查。有些单位还制定出定期检查的制度。各省、市间自开展竞赛以后，有些省、市也相互派代表进行参观访问。所有这些不同规模、不同形式的检查，都起了交流宝贵经验，推动爱国卫生运动进一步开展的作用。现在运动正向基本四无省、市和在全国范围内除尽四害的目标奋进，更需要全国性的大检查，使全国人民的除四害劲头，越鼓越大，信心越来越强，以推动全国的除四害运动加速进展。
    检查是保证每项任务实现的重要方法之一。一项任务有了规划才会有目标，而对这个规划执行与否和执行得怎么样？就必须通过及时的检查来发现问题和解决问题。而如北京等地把由上而下派出代表团，与由下而上的发动群众相结合，在准备检查和检查过程中进一步广泛而深入地宣传发动群众，交流经验，这样的作法则更能充分激发群众的干劲。
    我们希望在这次三市的检查中把卫生工作大大推进一步。
