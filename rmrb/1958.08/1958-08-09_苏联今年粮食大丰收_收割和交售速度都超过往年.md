The Soviet Union's Grain Harvest This Year
Harvesting and Delivery Speed Exceeds Previous Years

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Moscow, 8th) This year is a year of bumper harvests for the Soviet Union. Good news of grain harvests is constantly pouring in from all over the country. According to preliminary estimates, this year's output will break the 1956 bumper harvest record (the 1956 Soviet grain output was an unprecedented bumper harvest, 50% more than in 1953, the highest record in history).

Due to the purchase of agricultural machinery by collective farms, and the implementation of a new purchasing system for grain procurement, the speed of harvesting and the speed of national grain procurement this year have exceeded those of previous years. Collective farms in many regions are competing to transport new grain to state grain purchasing stations as quickly as possible. Many states in the south and the Uzbek Republic have completed their grain delivery tasks.

In the grain-producing areas of Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Don River basin, the Volga River basin, as well as the Caucasus and Ukraine, crops have been bountiful. Rostov Oblast alone will deliver 115 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 catties) of grain to the state. The Krasnodar and Stavropol regions completed their grain delivery plans to the state on July 23rd and 26th respectively. The famous Soviet granary, the Kuban, has delivered 110 million poods of grain to the state, exceeding the plan by 20 million poods, of which 75 million poods are high-grade wheat.

The grain crops in Ukraine, another granary of the Soviet Union, have also yielded very well this year. The harvesting work in the southern states of this republic has ended. Many collective farms are constantly transporting new grain to purchasing stations. As of August 5th, Ukraine had delivered 414 million poods of grain to the state, of which 351 million poods were wheat.

Kazakhstan's newly cultivated areas also promise a bumper harvest. The area has made all the preparations to welcome the fourth harvesting season of the reclaimed land. The people of Kazakhstan are preparing to deliver one billion poods of grain to the state this year. Now, a large number of young workers and students have come here from various cities to help with the harvest. At the same time, the areas in southern Soviet Union that have finished harvesting are constantly dispatching idle machines and tractor drivers to Kazakhstan to assist.

    东风劲吹频传捷报  西风日衰一片萧条
    苏联今年粮食大丰收
    收割和交售速度都超过往年
    本报莫斯科8日电  今年，苏联是一个丰收年，各地粮食丰收喜讯不断传来，据初步估计，今年的产量将打破1956年的丰收纪录（1956年苏联粮食产量空前丰收，比1953年增加50％，为历史上最高纪录）。
    由于集体农庄购买了农业机器，在粮食采购方面又实行了新的采购制度，促使今年收割工作的速度和国家采购粮食的速度，都超过了往年。许多地区的集体农庄都争先把新粮运到国家粮食采购站。南部许多州和乌兹别克共和国都已完成粮食交售任务。
    在产粮区西伯利亚、哈萨克、顿河流域和伏尔加河流域以及高加索和乌克兰地区农作物都获得丰收。仅罗斯托夫一个州就将向国家交售一亿一千五百万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）粮食。克拉斯诺达尔和斯达甫罗波尔两个边疆区分别在7月23日和26日完成了向国家交售粮食的计划。苏联著名的谷仓库班已向国家交售了一亿一千万普特粮食，超计划二千万普特，其中有七千五百万普特是高级小麦。
    苏联的另外一个谷仓乌克兰的粮食作物，今年的收成也很好，这个共和国南部各州的收割工作已经结束。许多集体农庄正在不断把新粮运往采购站。到8月5日为止，乌克兰交售给国家的粮食已有四亿一千四百万普特，其中三亿五千一百万普特是小麦。
    哈萨克的新垦区也丰收在望。这个地区已经作好了一切准备工作迎接开垦地的第四个收割季节，哈萨克人民准备今年向国家交售十亿普特粮食。现在，已经有大批青年工人、学生从各城市来到这里帮助收割。同时苏联南方已经收割完毕的地区，正不断把闲出来的机器和拖拉机手派到哈萨克来协助。
