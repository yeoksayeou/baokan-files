Patient's Good News

　　Bright Room Fluoroscopy
    For more than ten days, X-rays have been used for fluoroscopy in the bright room of the Jiande County Hospital in Zhejiang Province. The fluoroscopy room is well-ventilated and has plenty of light, eliminating the stuffy air, proneness to fainting and fear that patients have felt in dark fluoroscopy rooms for many years. Children no longer cry when they come for fluoroscopy. Darkroom equipment such as electric lights and fans can be saved, and work efficiency is more than doubled compared to working in a darkroom. In the past, a physical examination could only fluoroscope thirty people per hour, but now it can fluoroscope sixty-five people. Moreover, the equipment is simple and can be used for mobile fluoroscopy in rural areas, which is convenient for the masses.
    The innovation in X-ray fluoroscopy technology is the creation of Wang Yongsen, a young technician in the radiology department of Jiande Hospital. For several years, he has always felt that darkroom work added many difficulties for patients. Since the rectification campaign, Wang Yongsen's thinking has begun to be liberated. In mid-July, he was inspired by news about daytime film screenings, and the next day, with the help of his comrades, he began to experiment. Although the first two experiments failed, he continued to study and finally succeeded. (Attached picture)

　　亮房透视
    十多天来，爱克司光在浙江建德县医院明亮的房间里进行透视。透视房里空气流通，光线充足，消除了多少年来病人感到透视暗房的空气沉闷，容易引起昏晕、恐惧等情况，小孩子来透视也不哭了；电灯、电扇等暗室设备都可以节省，工作效率比在暗室里提高了一倍多。过去体格检查一小时只能透视三十人，现在能透视六十五人。而且设备简单，可以在农村进行巡回透视，便利群众。
    爱克司光透视技术方面的革新，是建德医院放射科青年技工王永森的创造。几年来，他在工作中，一直感到暗房工作给病人增加许多困难。自整风以来，王永森思想开始解放了。7月中旬，他看到有关白天放映电影的消息，受到了启发，第二天就在同志们的帮助下，进行试验。这项试验在头两次虽然失败了，但由于他继续钻研，终于获得了成功。（附图片）
