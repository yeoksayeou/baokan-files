Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 9th: A mass upsurge in the production of ball bearings is sweeping across Sichuan Province. More than sixty counties throughout the province have successfully trial-produced ball bearings. According to incomplete statistics, more than 700,000 pieces of agricultural equipment (including carts) have been fitted with ball bearings in various regions.

In recent days, local Communist Party committees have made the production of ball bearings the centerpiece of the agricultural implement reform movement. Localities have adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. In addition to agricultural implement factories engaging in large-scale ball bearing production, the masses have adopted diverse indigenous methods to manufacture balls. The masses in Dongxi District, Cangxi County, created more than a dozen types of molds. Lacking machine tools, they used iron bars with "clips" attached to both ends as substitutes, and manufactured ball bearings in three consecutive days and nights.

In order to solve the technical, labor, and raw material difficulties in ball bearing production, mass collaboration has been universally launched throughout the region. Meishan County organized county-wide collaboration between factories and communes. Santai County concentrated the ironworkers, woodworkers, and stoneworkers from factories and handicraft cooperatives throughout the county to learn, produce, and teach techniques to farmers simultaneously, rapidly forming a high tide in ball bearing production throughout the county.

    四川展开全民大协作  克服技术和原料困难
    据新华社成都9日电　四川省各地掀起全民性的大造滚珠轴承的热潮。全省有六十多个县先后试制成功了滚珠轴承。据不完全统计，各地已有七十多万件运转农具（包括车子）安上了滚珠轴承。
    这些天来，各地中共党委都把制造滚珠轴承做为农具改革运动的中心。各地采取土、洋结合的办法，除了农具工厂大搞滚珠轴承外，广大群众采取了多种多样土办法制造滚珠。苍溪县东溪区群众制造出十几种模具，没有机床就用铁棒两端安上“卡子”代替，接连三个昼夜就制造出滚珠轴承。
    为了解决滚珠轴承中的技术、人力以及原材料的困难，各地普遍展开了全民性的大协作。眉山县组织了全县的工厂与工厂、社与社的大协作，三台县集中了全县工厂、手工业社的铁工、木工、石工边学、边做、边向农民传授技术，使全县滚珠轴承的生产迅速形成高潮。（附图片）
