Everyone Manages Affairs, Everyone is in Charge
-- How Qingcheng Cooperative Implements Member Participation in Cooperative Management
Rural Work Department of the Shuangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Qingcheng Agricultural Cooperative, Happiness Township, Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, has implemented a “four-guarantee system” since the spring of 1956. In the spring of 1957, to ensure the quality of field operations, the "responsibility field" method was further implemented. More than a year of practice has proven that the implementation of this method has played a significant role in stimulating the majority of cooperative members to manage cooperative production and improve cultivation quality. Responsibility field managers conscientiously supervised the implementation of various measures and checked the quality of production in various production activities, making the quality of spring plowing and summer hoeing production far superior to previous years. The cooperative's land basically guaranteed full seedling emergence, solving the contradiction of having too few people in charge of field management. However, in addition to field management, the team leader still had to take the lead in everything. The members did not think about anything, believing that everything should be managed by the team leader; if the team leader did not arrange things, no one would arrange them. The team leader ran around all day and was exhausted, and still many problems arose. Last year, the cooperative had over 10,000 catties of straw go moldy. For the past two years, they bought sacks every autumn when delivering grain, but by the following autumn they were all gone. The team leader spent most of the day doing chores and rarely worked with the members. According to statistics, from January to the end of May 1958, the seven team leaders worked a total of 896 days, of which 424 days were spent working with the members, accounting for 47% of the total working days; 438 days were spent on chores and odd jobs, accounting for 49%; and 34 days were spent attending meetings at the county, township, and cooperative levels, accounting for 4%. The masses reflected that the team leaders "earn points without working." The members of the first team called their team leader, Na Chunkui, a lazy team leader. The team leaders reflected, "Being a team leader means wearing out your shoes and ruining your eyesight without getting any credit." Therefore, three team leaders requested to quit during the cooperative rectification this spring. During the "Double-Anti" campaign, the masses put up many big-character posters exposing losses, waste, and the team leaders' failure to participate in labor with the members. At the same time, they suggested: Implementing the responsibility field system has increased the number of people in charge of field management, and the quality of production has also greatly improved compared to the past. If the management of finance, livestock, technology, etc., were all handled in the same way as the responsibility fields, so that everyone is in charge of everything and everyone is responsible, wouldn't that be even better?

    The New Development of Responsibility Fields – Cooperative Members Managing the Cooperative

    Based on the opinions of the masses, the branch and the management committee launched several discussions among the members. Finally, it was decided to establish management groups for finance, animal husbandry, technology, propaganda and mobilization, etc., and to divide all formal members who regularly participate in labor (excluding landlords and rich peasants) into each group according to their respective specialties. Everyone believed that this could mobilize everyone's enthusiasm to contribute to running the cooperative well.

    However, there were "four fears" among the masses: First, fear of offending people; second, fear of affecting one's own rest; third, fear that others would not accept inspection and supervision or would satirize themselves; and fourth, fear of not being able to handle the responsibility and not being able to do a good job if there were difficulties. Based on these thoughts, the branch launched a major debate among the members, strengthening the education of the sense of ownership. It also put forward the slogan "Everyone is in charge of everything, everyone has something to do." The Party branch demanded that Party members and Youth League members "do whatever is assigned, set an example to lead the masses, and ensure that the job is done well." This strengthened the members' confidence in participating in the management of the cooperative.

    After ideological unity was achieved, after further discussions, it was decided to organize eight groups within the production team: political mobilization group, field management group, technical research group, finance group, animal husbandry group, industrial and sideline occupation group, machinery group, and cultural and welfare group. The mechanized farming team remained as a machinery group. The personnel directly engaged in industrial and sideline occupations operated by the cooperative formed an industrial and sideline occupation group. Members were appropriately assigned to each group according to their political ideology, specialties, and willingness, as well as the number of people needed in each group. Party members, Youth League members, and production activists were appropriately assigned to each group as backbone members. And according to the number of people in each group and the scope of work, a group leader who was politically reliable, supported by the masses, and had certain leadership abilities was selected to lead the work of the whole group.

    After the personnel and organization were determined, the tasks and powers of each group were further clarified based on the experience of implementing the "responsibility field" system, and specific working methods were taught. After discussion by the members, the overall tasks of each group were summarized as follows: ① Conscientiously implement the Party's various policies and the resolutions of the members' representative assembly. ② Be responsible for supervising and inspecting the implementation of various measures by the cooperative teams. ③ Protect the cooperative's public property and fight against all losses and waste. In order to enable each manager to perform his duties more effectively, it was also stipulated that the manager has the right to check the implementation of the resolutions of the members' representative assembly by each member and to criticize all phenomena of "less, slow, poor, and costly." It was also determined that plans should be formulated in daily actions, tasks should be clarified, individual responsibilities should be assigned, cooperation should be promoted, examples should be set, supervision and inspection should be conducted, and experiences should be summarized regularly. The specific tasks, powers, and working methods of each group are:

    Political Mobilization Group Task: ① Regularly publicize and implement the Party's policies and the resolutions of the members' representative assembly; ② Regularly understand the members' ideological situation, conduct propaganda and education in light of the ideological situation, and constantly report the changes in the members' thinking to the cooperative team leaders. Power: Has the right to use various meetings to carry out propaganda activities, but must obtain the consent of the person presiding over the meeting in advance; has the right to use various forms to conduct criticism and commendation. Working methods: Talk to everyone you meet, chat with everyone you see, publicize wherever production goes, and use various forms to conduct propaganda.

    Field Management Group Task: ① Supervise and ensure the implementation of various measures to increase production; ② Inspect and accept the quality of production. Power: Has the right to criticize or educate members who do not implement production plans or whose production quality is rough, and in serious cases, instruct the team leader to rework or deduct points. Working methods: As far as possible, farm work suitable for one person to operate is contracted to the manager; collective operations are inspected and problems are solved while working; farm work that cannot be inspected at any time during work is inspected and accepted during morning and evening breaks.

    Animal Husbandry Group Task: ① Protect the health of various livestock; ② Do a good job in livestock breeding and ensure the development of livestock. Power: Has the right to criticize those who do not cherish livestock, and has the right to propose methods for livestock use and management, and order relevant personnel to implement them. Working methods: Feeding and service personnel implement contracting, establish a handover system, and conduct regular supervision and regular inspection.

    Finance Group Task: ① Announce the team's accounts monthly; ② Manage the team's public property; ③ Assist the management committee in organizing sources of funds. Power: Has the right to supervise the use of cooperative team funds and has the right to criticize or propose handling opinions for those who do not cherish public property. Working methods: Personal contracting and regular inventory are implemented for long-term used property; a handover and acceptance system for entry and exit of warehouses is established for centralized storage and decentralized use of property.

    Technical Research Group Task: ① Research, create, and reform technology, and promote experience from other places; ② Impart technology to members and organize members to learn technology. Power: Has the right to cultivate various experimental fields. Working methods: Regularly learn technology and constantly conduct scientific and technological experiments in the production process.

    Machinery Group Task: ① Supervise and assist the mechanized farming team in managing its operations and giving full play to the efficiency of the machinery; ② Supervise the quality of mechanized farming operations; ③ Assist and supervise the mechanized farming team to protect machinery and agricultural tools so that property is not lost. Power: Has the right to participate in various meetings of the mechanized farming team and has the right to preferentially participate in mechanized work labor. Method: Always pay attention to the problems in mechanical production and the work of mechanical personnel, and help study various mechanical tasks.

    Industrial and Sideline Occupation Group Task: ① Open various small-scale industries and open up various sideline production avenues according to the cooperative's natural resources and economic strength; ② Ensure the implementation of various industrial and sideline production plans and production measures. Power: Has the right to inspect the quality of industrial and sideline products and the production management and financial management of each unit. Working methods: Always pay attention, conduct regular inspections, and make suggestions and criticisms at any time.

    Cultural and Welfare Group Task: ① Organize members to learn culture; ② Organize members to carry out cultural and sports activities; ③ Launch and organize members to carry out patriotic health campaigns. Power: Has the right to check the learning and health conditions of each member and organize members to learn culture, pay attention to hygiene, participate in entertainment and sports activities, and criticize and commend. Working methods: Set an example to participate in various activities, and regularly organize members to carry out various activities according to the needs of members and the busy and slack seasons of production.

    In addition to having the same tasks and powers as the members, the management group leader must also lead the work responsible for the entire group, report the situation to the team leader on time, and have the right to convene meetings of the group and participate in team affairs meetings.

    After implementing the participation of cooperative members in the management work, is it necessary to have a reward and punishment system? After discussion by the members, it was decided to implement a method of rewarding but not punishing. It was also decided that in addition to commendation, criticism, and education, those who complete the task on time in management or who have made significant achievements in over-fulfilling the task will be given a reward of 2% of the total labor points for the quarter to the group or individual. If the whole group wins the prize, the group will democratically assess the size of the prize according to the size of each person's performance.

    Production team leaders provide collective leadership and division of labor. Each team has three male team leaders and one female team leader. The chief team leader leads the political mobilization group and the technical research group; the second team leader leads the field management group and the machinery group; the third team leader leads the animal husbandry group, the finance group, and the industrial and sideline occupation group; and the women's team leader leads the cultural and welfare group. In daily work, the team leader must constantly strengthen political and ideological education work, help each group make work plans on a quarterly and segment basis, and try to work in the places for which they are responsible when allocating work. If a large number of laborers are transferred out, try to take care to leave a certain number of people in each group to be responsible for management so that problems can be discovered and resolved in a timely manner.

    In addition to dividing labor and contracting, the management committee must constantly improve the team leaders' understanding of the important significance of "cooperative members participating in the management of the cooperative," and must continue to go deep into the teams to participate in production and lead production, discover problems and help the team leaders solve them in a timely manner, and cultivate models of various management groups, summarize experience, and organize exchanges, so that the system of cooperative members participating in the management of the cooperative can be maintained well.

    Resolving Contradictions and Promoting Production

    Since the implementation of "cooperative members participating in the management of the cooperative," the Party's mass line has been effectively implemented in all aspects of work. Of the 468 men and women members who regularly participate in labor in the cooperative, more than 380 are now participating in management, accounting for 81.6% of the members participating in labor, of which 374 are male members, and 337 are participating in management, accounting for 90% of male members; of the 94 female members who regularly participate in labor, 49 are participating in management, accounting for 52%. Although the implementation of this method has not been long, the preliminary effects are indeed significant. A new atmosphere of "everyone is in charge, everything is managed" has emerged. Business management has been greatly improved, production indicators are constantly being broken through, measures are constantly being added, and production quality has also been significantly improved, thus effectively promoting the great leap in production.

    The relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened. In the past, for things that were not well managed in work, members complained that the cadres were not responsible, and the cadres believed that the members were not highly aware. For example, the production team leader sometimes felt distressed, felt that the work was too complicated, and the effort was not small, but there were still many problems. After the members participated in management, everyone was responsible, and the production team leader was liberated from the circle of trivial affairs. After managing these things, the members felt that the burden was very heavy, and at the same time, they recalled that they also sympathized with the production team leader in the past, so the relationship between cadres and the masses was further strengthened. Now, the members often help the team leader make plans and think of ways, and if they see that the team leader is too busy, they will take the initiative to help the team leader. The team leader has also further realized that only by relying on the masses and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses can the cooperative be run well.

    The sense of responsibility of being the master of the cooperative has been enhanced. After the members assumed their management responsibilities, they no longer rely on the team leader in everything as they did in the past. For example, member Chi Yongshan said: "In the past, I only knew how to work and didn't care about anything. Now we are both members and cadres." The people in the responsibility field group are more responsible than in the past. They said: "In the past, only some of us were in charge of the fields. This time, everyone is in charge, so we have to manage it well." Therefore, they pay great attention to quality when weeding and pay attention to inspecting and helping others. The members of the political mobilization group read newspapers in the fields every day to publicize good experiences from other places. The members in charge of the finance group helped the custodians clean up the property and arranged the agricultural tools in the warehouse neatly. The custodian also established a handover and acceptance system for the use of agricultural tools. Now each group checks and supervises the work for which it is responsible as if it were managing its own family's affairs.

    Promoted the great leap in production. Because the members improved their ideological awareness and established a sense of responsibility as masters, their enthusiasm for labor was even higher, thus greatly promoting summer hoeing production. In previous years, summer hoeing tasks were completed five or six days after the Minor Heat solar term. This year, seven days before the Minor Heat solar term, in addition to completing the hoeing task, 75% of the land was also top-dressed once, and 120 hectares of high-yield corn fields were top-dressed three times. Because a large number of measures such as seedling replenishment, top dressing, and watering have been increased, this year's crops are much better than in previous years.

    人人都管事　事事有人管
    ——庆城社是怎样实行社员参加管理合作社的
    中共双城县委农村工作部
    黑龙江省双城县幸福乡庆城农业社，从1956年春就实行了四包制度。为了保证田间作业质量，1957年春天进一步实行了“责任田”的办法。经过一年多的实践证明，实行这个办法以后，对激发广大社员管理合作社生产，提高耕作质量，起了很大作用。责任田管理人在各项生产中，认真监督各项措施的实现和检查生产的质量，使春耕夏锄生产质量大大胜过往年。全社土地基本保证了全苗，解决了田间管理上负责人少的矛盾。但是，除了田间管理外，还是事事都得队长出头，社员啥也不想，认为一切都该由队长管，缺啥少啥队长不张罗就没人张罗。队长一天东跑西跑，忙得够呛，还出了不少问题。去年全社霉了一万多斤谷草。二年来每年秋天送粮时买一次麻袋，到第二年秋天就全没有了。队长每天多数是办杂事，与社员一起干活很少。据统计，1958年1月到5月末，七个队队长共劳动八百九十六天，和社员在一起干活四百二十四天，占总劳动天数47％；办杂事和干零活四百三十八天，占49％；参加县、乡、社开会三十四天，占4％。群众反映：队长“不干活也挣分”，第一队社员管队长那春魁叫懒队长。队长反映：“当队长就是跑掉鞋底子，熬瞎了眼睛也讨不出好来”。因此在今年春天整社时就有三名队长要求不干。双反时，群众给贴出很多揭发损失浪费和队长不参加社员一起劳动的大字报，同时提出：实行责任田，田间管理负责人多了，生产质量也比过去有很大提高，如果财务、牲畜、技术等管理都像责任田这样办，叫事事有人管，人人都负责，不就更好了吗？
    责任田的新发展——社员管理合作社
    根据群众意见，支部和管委会发动社员几次讨论，最后决定以财务、畜牧、技术、宣传鼓动等成立管理小组，把所有经常参加劳动的正式社员（地主、富农除外），根据每个人的特长都划分在每个组里去。大家认为这样能把每个人的积极性都调动起来，为办好社献出力量。
    但群众中有“四怕”：一怕得罪人，二怕影响自己休息，三怕别人不接受检查监督和讽刺自己，四怕担当不起来，有困难干不好。支部根据这些思想发动社员进行一次大辩论，加强了主人翁思想的教育。并提出“事事有人管，人人有事干”的口号，党支部对党员、团员提出：“分配啥作啥，以身作则带动群众，保证作好”的要求。从而坚定了社员参加管理合作社的信心。
    在思想统一之后，经过进一步讨论，确定在生产队内组织政治鼓动组、田间管理组、技术研究组、财务组、畜牧组、工副业组、机械组、文化福利组等八个组。机耕队仍为一个机械组。社内直接经营的工副业人员组成一个工副业组。把社员根据每人政治思想、特长和自愿以及每组需要人数，适当分配到每个组去。把党团员、生产积极分子，适当搭配到每个组作为骨干。并根据每组人数多少，工作范围，选出政治可靠、群众拥护、有一定领导能力的小组长，领导全组工作。
    人员和组织确定之后，进一步根据“责任田”制度的执行经验，明确规定各组的任务和权力，具体教给工作方法。经过社员讨论，综合起来规定各组总的任务是：①认真贯彻执行党的各项方针政策和社员代表大会决议。②负责监督检查保证社队各项措施的实现。③保护合作社的公共财产，向一切损失浪费现象作斗争。为了使每个管理人都能更有效地履行自己的职务，还规定了管理人有权检查每个社员对社员代表大会决议执行情况和向一切少慢差费现象提出批评。并确定在日常行动上也要制定计划，明确任务，个人分工，互相协作，以身作则，检查监督，定期研究，总结经验。每个组的具体任务、权力和工作方法是：
    政治鼓动组任务：①经常宣传贯彻执行党的方针政策和社员代表大会的决议；②经常了解社员的思想情况，针对思想情况进行宣传教育，并不断的向社队领导汇报社员思想变化情况。权力：有权利用各种会议进行宣传活动，但必须事先取得主持会议的人的同意；有权利用各种形式进行批评和表扬。工作方法：逢人就讲，见人就唠，生产到哪宣传到哪，利用各种形式进行宣传。
    田间管理组任务：①监督和保证各项增产措施的实现；②检查验收生产质量。权力：对不执行生产计划或生产质量粗糙的社员，有权提出批评或教育，严重者通过队长责成返工或扣分。工作方法：凡是适合一个人操作的农活，尽可能包给管理人去做；集体操作的农活，在工作中边劳动边检查，边解决问题；不能在干活中随时检查的农活，利用早晚休息时间进行检查验收。
    畜牧组任务：①保护各种牲畜健康；②作好牲畜繁殖工作，保证牲畜发展。权力：有权对不爱护牲畜者提出批评，有权提出牲畜使役和管理方法，并责成有关人员执行。工作方法：饲养和实役人员实行包干，建立接交制度，并进行随时监督和定期检查。
    财务组任务：①按月公布队内账目；②管理队内的公共财产；③协助管委会组织资金来源。权力：有权监督社队资金使用和对不爱护公共财产者有权提出批评或处理意见。工作方法：对长期使用的财产实行个人包干、定期清点；集中保管分散使用的财产，建立出入库的接交验收制度。
    技术研究组任务：①研究创造和改革技术，并推广外地经验；②向社员传授技术和组织社员学习技术。权力：有权培养各种试验田。工作方法：经常学习技术，在生产过程中不断进行科学技术试验。
    机械组任务：①监督和协助机耕队搞好经营管理，发挥机具效能；②监督机耕作业质量；③协助和监督机耕队保护机车和农具，使财产不受损失。权力：有权参加机耕队的各种会议，有权优先参加机械作业劳动。方法：随时注意机械生产中的问题和机械人员的工作，并帮助研究各种机械工作。
    工副业组任务：①根据合作社的自然资源和经济力量开办各种小型工业和开辟各种副业生产门路；②保证各工业副业生产计划和生产措施的实现。权力：有权检查工业副业产品质量和每个单位的生产管理、财务管理。工作方法：随时注意、定期检查、并随时提出意见和批评。
    文化福利组任务：①组织社员学习文化；②组织社员开展文体活动；③发动和组织社员开展爱国卫生运动。权力：有权检查每个社员学习和卫生情况和组织社员学习文化讲究卫生参加文娱体育活动及批评表扬。工作方法：以身作则参加各种活动，经常根据社员要求和生产季节忙闲组织社员进行各项活动。
    管理组组长除了和组员有同样任务权力外，还要领导好全组所负责的工作，并按时向队长汇报情况，并有权召开本小组会议和参加队务会议。
    在实行社员参加合作社的管理工作之后，需不需要有奖惩制度呢？经过社员辩论，确定实行光奖不罚的办法。并确定了除表扬批评教育外，凡在管理上按时完成任务或超额完成任务有显著成绩的，给小组或个人本季度总劳动工分2％的奖励。属于全组得奖的，小组内根据每个人成绩大小民主评定，好的多奖，一般的少奖，不负责的不奖。
    生产队长集体领导，分工负责。每队三个男队长，一个女队长。正队长领导政治鼓动组和技术研究组；第二队长领导田间管理组和机械组；第三队长领导畜牧组、财务组、工副业组；妇女队长领导文化福利组。在日常工作中，队长要不断的加强政治思想教育工作，按季按段帮助各小组作出工作计划，在分配活计时要尽量到自己负责的地方去工作。如果遇到大批劳力外调时，尽可能照顾各组留一定人负责管理，以便发现问题及时解决。
    管委会除了分工包干外，要经常不断的提高队长对“社员参加管理合作社”重要意义的认识，并要继续深入各队参加生产领导生产，发现问题及时帮助队长解决，以及培养出各种管理组的标兵，总结经验，组织交流，使社员参加管理合作社制度很好的坚持下去。
    解决矛盾　促进生产
    实行“社员参加管理合作社”以后，在各项工作中都切实的贯彻了党的群众路线。全社四百六十八名经常参加劳动的男女社员，现在就有三百八十多人参加管理，占参加劳动的社员81.6％，其中男社员三百七十四人，参加管理的三百三十七人，占男社员的90％；经常参加劳动的九十四名女社员，参加管理的四十九
  人，占52％。实行这个办法虽然时间不长，但是初步效果确很显著。出现了“人人都管事，事事有人管”的新气象。经营管理有了很大改进，生产指标不断突破，措施不断增加，生产质量也有显著提高，从而有力的促进了生产大跃进。
    进一步密切了干群关系。过去在工作上有些管理不到的事，社员就怨干部不负责任，干部认为社员觉悟不高。比如生产队长有时就感到苦闷，觉得工作太复杂了，劲没少使，问题还不少。社员参加管理以后，人人都负责了，把生产队长从繁琐的事务圈子里解放出来了。社员们管理这些事情以后，都感到担子很重，同时他们回想起来过去也很同情生产队长，因此进一步密切了干群关系。现在，社员们时常帮助队长作计划、想办法，看队长忙不开了就主动的帮助队长去干。队长也进一步认识到只有依靠群众、发挥群众的积极性，合作社才能办好。
    增强了以社为家的主人翁的责任感。社员们担负起自己的管理责任以后，不像过去事事依靠队长了。如社员池永山说：“过去我光知道干活啥也不管，现在我们又是社员又是干部了”。责任田小组的人比过去更负责任了，他们说：“过去就光咱一些人管田间，这回大家管事了，我们更得好好的管起来了”。因此他们在铲地时非常注意质量，并且注意检查和帮助别人。政治鼓动组的社员每天都在地里读报纸，宣传外地的好经验。负责财务组的社员帮助保管员清理财产，同时把仓库的农具收拾得整整齐齐，保管员对农具使用也都建立了接交验收制度。现在各个组都像管理自己家的事一样，检查和监督自己所负责的工作。
    促进了生产大跃进。由于社员提高了思想觉悟、树立了主人翁责任感，劳动劲头更加高涨，从而大大的推动了夏锄生产。每年夏锄都是过小暑五、六天才完成铲趟任务，今年小暑前七天除了完成铲趟任务以外，还将75％的土地进行一次追肥，并将一百二十垧苞米高产田追三次肥。由于补苗、追肥、浇地等措施大量增加，今年禾苗大大胜过往年。
