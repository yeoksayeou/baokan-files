A Red Flag That Never Fades
　　Zhang Qiuxiang Helps Others Catch Up With Her
　　Her Touching Deeds in the High-Yield Cotton Competition Spread Throughout Guanzhong
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Wang Yong reports: Chairman Mao teaches us to develop “a spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self.” He said: “A man’s ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is a man of noble character, a pure man, a moral man, a man who is free from base desires and of benefit to the people.” This kind of communist morality is growing in the current socialist competition. Zhang Qiuxiang, a national agricultural labor model, is such a person. This ordinary forty-nine-year-old rural woman has been hired as a special researcher by the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences because she has mastered a set of cotton planting techniques and created high cotton records. However, what is most precious is that she does not regard these experiences as her personal property, but as the common property of the people, helping others catch up with her in the competition between others and herself, and creating huge wealth for the people of the whole country.
　　Learning From Zhang Qiuxiang, Catching Up With Zhang Qiuxiang
    This spring, even before the cotton was sown, many people wrote to her, and many farmers made a special trip from afar to visit her, to learn from her cotton planting techniques and experience. She also went to Gaoling, Fuping, Tongguan, Huayin and other counties to give on-site instruction. A competition to "learn from Zhang Qiuxiang and catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang" was launched throughout Shaanxi Province. More than 33,000 "Qiuxiang cotton farming groups" emerged successively in various counties, and more than 40,000 mu of high-yield cotton fields were named "Qiuxiang fields."
    Zhang Qiuxiang is the deputy director of the Balidian Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province. The cotton planting group she led has achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu for three consecutive years. This spring, at the Shaanxi Provincial Cotton Production Conference, she issued a cotton high-yield competition challenge to farmers throughout the province. At that time, her high-yield cotton field planned to produce 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu, but some of the high-yield fields responding to the challenge had yields far exceeding Zhang Qiuxiang's. Many young women in Huayin, Tongguan and other counties made up their minds that they would not marry if they did not catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang. Old ladies in their fifties and sixties moved their stoves to the fields in order to catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang.
　　If Others Are Catching Up, You Have to Run Faster
    Under this situation, a few members of the Balidian Agricultural Cooperative led by Zhang Qiuxiang felt afraid and timid. They complained that they should not have shown off and challenged in the past. Some people also said:
  "Let's close the door and do our own thing this year! Real gold is not afraid of fire, as long as we don't pass on our experience to others, no one can take away our red flag." But Zhang Qiuxiang and most people believe: "If others are catching up, we have to run faster!" Zhang Qiuxiang felt that in the past few years, when they were engaged in cotton high-yield experiments, it was like a person running a race, it didn't matter whether they walked fast or slow, they were lazy and slow, and they lacked energy. But now, many people are coming to catch up with her, and some may surpass her immediately, which makes her more energetic than in the past. This is a force that motivates them to keep moving forward. This spring, they re-examined this year's cotton production conditions, tried every means to tap the potential for increased production, and decided to increase the cotton yield of this year's high-yield fields from 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu to 3,000 jin. They actively learned from other cooperatives and actively imparted their experience to others, helping others catch up with them.
    Before and after cotton sowing, Zhang Qiuxiang often went out to impart experience, and after returning, she was busy receiving people from all over the country who came to visit, delaying some working days. Some cooperative members said: "Director! We haven't finished weeding the sedge in our shoes, don't just care about others." Some saw that the high-yield cotton in the nearby agricultural cooperative was growing well and had the potential to surpass them. Seeing that Zhang Qiuxiang was not at all wary of her opponents in this competition, but instead helped them enthusiastically, they whispered behind her back: "People raise cats to catch mice, but we raise cats to bite chickens."
  　Not Helping Others is Forgetting Our Roots
    After hearing these words, Zhang Qiuxiang thought that some cooperative members had misunderstood the significance of the current socialist competition. She often told the cooperative members that the current high-yield competition movement is not a matter of one mu or two mu, one cooperative or two cooperatives, but to promote overall production increase for everyone. A cooperative obtaining a few thousand-jin high-yield fields only increases by a thousand jin of cotton. Now, the goal is to make all cotton in the whole township, county, province, and country achieve high yields, so that the production can be increased by tens of thousands of jin of cotton. Zhang Qiuxiang did not forget how her cotton planting experience came about. Before liberation, farmers Liu Zhihui, Liu Deyi, Chang Yuesheng, and Chang Yueyi in Balidian Village were experts in cotton farming, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. However, at that time, due to the limitations of the individual economy, farmers kept secrets from each other, fearing that their techniques would be learned by others. At that time, although the cotton yield of some individuals had reached more than 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, these experiences were never promoted on a large scale. The average cotton yield of the whole village was only more than 120 jin. In order to increase cotton production, old man Liu Ximin once "stole" some high-yielding cotton varieties from Lintong County, but unfortunately, because he did not understand the characteristics and cultivation techniques of this cotton, and others were unwilling to cooperate with him, he still failed to trial-plant it successfully. After liberation, the situation completely changed. When Zhang Qiuxiang began to learn cotton planting techniques, she was ridiculed and attacked by some people, but she also received support and encouragement from many people, and with the progress of cooperativization, more and more people supported her. The Party and the People's Government strongly supported her, helping to solve various material problems needed for high-yield cotton fields, and also sent technical cadres to help them learn techniques. Many old farmers also came to help her. Zhang Qiuxiang said to everyone: "We cannot forget how our experience came about? The Party has supported us, the masses have helped us, we cannot 'kick away the ladder after crossing the river', and we should actively help other fraternal agricultural cooperatives."
    Those Who Harm Others and Benefit Themselves Are Not Worthy of Participating in Socialist Competition
    Once, Zhang Qiuxiang and the cotton appraisal and inspection team of the township inspected the high-yield cotton in the whole township. When they walked to the cotton field cultivated by Sun Xiuyun, the women's director of Zhangtian Cooperative, everyone was attracted by this excellent cotton: this cotton grew particularly tall, the leaves were green and thick, like a lake of lush lotus leaves. At that time, many people praised the cotton for being well cultivated, but some people did not express their opinions. An old man named Liu Changfa seemed to see the problem with this cotton, but when others asked him, he smiled and shook his head, unwilling to tell the truth. Zhang Qiuxiang saw through Liu Lao Han's thoughts. She said: "What? You don't want to point out the shortcomings to others? Socialism hopes that everyone is good, and we can't just point out other people's 'dark holes'. People who expect to win by relying on the shortcomings of others are not worthy of participating in the socialist competition." Then she frankly said that this cotton looked very lush on the surface, but in reality, it only grew branches and leaves without producing flower buds. If she didn't immediately take action to suppress the crazy growth, it would affect this year's cotton production. At that time, she explained in detail the methods to inhibit the crazy growth of cotton, and organized the members of Zhangtian Cooperative to process it immediately.
    Zhang Qiuxiang actively helps ordinary cotton farmers, and also actively helps those competitors with better technology who may surpass her. There is a young woman named Xue Junxiu in Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangwang Township. She is smart and capable. The cotton farming team she led began to learn Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting techniques last year. The yield they achieved in the first year was only more than 300 jin lower than that of Zhang Qiuxiang. Some people discussed behind their backs: "Hey! Xue Junxiu is really amazing. If she continues to work like this, she will surely overwhelm Zhang Qiuxiang in two years." The members of Balidian Agricultural Cooperative felt a little uncomfortable when they heard these words, but Zhang Qiuxiang thought that if Xue Junxiu could catch up with her, she could break some people's conservative ideas! That would mean that the cotton yield in Shuangwang Township could continue to increase. As for Xue Junxiu possibly surpassing herself, she welcomed it very much. She thought: Xue Junxiu is capable, but I'm not eating for free. If you can produce 2,800 jin per mu, I'll give you 3,500 jin per mu. If you want to surpass me, you have to sweat a lot. This is a good thing, if you walk fast, you can force me to run! She actively helps Xue Junxiu to catch up with her. In early May, most of Xue Junxiu's high-yield cotton seedlings were eaten to death by cutworms. The surviving cotton seedlings were also sparse and yellow. The local old farmers believed that they could not be saved. Several young women cried anxiously. When Xue Junxiu proposed to consult Zhang Qiuxiang, several old men shook their heads and said: "It's no use even if she comes. Even if she has a solution, she won't come. 'Zhuge Liang goes to Jiangdong', what is she doing it for!" Xue Junxiu thought: If Zhang Qiuxiang really wants to help me, she can't stand by at this critical moment! She still went to ask Zhang Qiuxiang for advice, and Zhang Qiuxiang really came.
　　Her Son's Illness is a Minor Matter, Xue Junxiu's Cotton is a Major Matter for the Masses
    On the way, a acquaintance suddenly said that Zhang Qiuxiang's son was ill. Zhang Qiuxiang hesitated for a moment: Should she go to see her son? Or should she go to Xue Junxiu's cotton field? Her son's illness is a minor family matter, while Xue Junxiu's cotton is a major matter for the masses! If this high-yield cotton experiment fails, then the "old conservatives" of Shuangwang Township will chew their tongues again, which will be a great loss to the country and the people! After thinking it over, she finally decided to follow Xue Junxiu. After she went to the site to check, she suggested that Xue Junxiu organize the cooperative members to quickly transplant the seedlings and replant all the missing seedlings. She also personally taught them the operation method of transplanting seedlings and the field management experience after transplanting seedlings. Later, after seven or eight days of processing and fertilization, the cotton was finally saved.
    Helping Others Also Gets Help From Others
    Zhang Qiuxiang's selfless spirit of helping others moved many people. She helped others, and she also got help from others. The nearby farmers are also very concerned about the cotton in Balidian Agricultural Cooperative, often asking about the growth of Zhang Qiuxiang's high-yield cotton, for fear that something might go wrong. Once, a large-scale insect infestation occurred in the high-yield cotton in Balidian Agricultural Cooperative. As soon as the cooperative members of the neighboring land found out, they ran to report it and organized them to jointly prevent and control it.

    一面永不褪色的红旗
　　张秋香帮助别人赶上自己
　　她在棉花高额丰产竞赛中感人的事迹传遍关中
    本报讯　记者王永报道：毛主席教导我们要养成“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，他说：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”这种共产主义的道德品质，正在当前社会主义竞赛中成长着。全国农业劳动模范张秋香就是这样的人。这个普通的四十九岁的农村妇女，因为她掌握了一套植棉技术知识，创造了高额棉花纪录，被中国科学院陕西分院聘请为特约研究员。但是，最可珍贵的，还是她并不把这些经验当成个人的私有财产，而是把它当成人民的公共财产，在别人和自己竞赛中帮助别人赶上自己，为全国人民创造巨大的财富。
　　学习张秋香赶上张秋香
    今年春天，还在棉花播种以前，许多人就写信给她，许多农民特地从远道跑来访问她，向她学习植棉技术和经验。她也曾到高陵、富平、潼关、华阴等县去作现场传授。一个“学习张秋香，赶上张秋香”的竞赛在陕西全省展开了。各县先后涌现了三万三千多个“秋香务棉组”，四万多亩棉花丰产田都被命名为“秋香田”。
    张秋香是陕西渭南县双王乡八里店农业社的副主任。她领导的植棉小组在过去三年中，曾连续获得平均亩产籽棉一千斤的高额丰产。今春，她在陕西省棉花生产会议上，向全省农民提出棉花丰产竞赛挑战。那时，她的棉花丰产田计划亩产籽棉一千五百斤，但是各地应战的，有的高额丰产田产量大大超过了张秋香的产量。华阴、潼关等县许多年轻姑娘下了很大决心，她们说，赶不上张秋香就不结婚。五、六十岁的老太太为了赶上张秋香，把锅灶都搬到地里去了。
　  别人赶自己就得快步跑
    在这种形势下，张秋香领导的八里店农业社的社员们，有少数人感觉到害怕、怯场，他们抱怨过去不该出风头挑战。有些人还说：
  “今年咱们关门闹吧！真金子不怕火炼，只要不给别人传授经验，谁也夺不了咱们的红旗。”但是张秋香和大多数人却认为：“别人赶，咱们就得快步跑呵！”张秋香感觉到过去几年，她们在搞棉花丰产试验时，好像一个人赛跑，走紧走慢都关系不大，懒懒缓缓，劲头不足。可是现在，许多人都来赶她，而且有些人都可能马上就超过她，这就使她的劲头比过去更大了。这是一种促使他们不断前进的力量。今春，他们重新研究了今年的棉花生产条件，千方百计地挖掘增产潜力，决定把今年的高额丰产田的棉花产量由亩产籽棉一千五百斤提高到三千斤。他们积极向别的社学习，又积极地把自己的经验传授给别人，帮助别人赶上自己。
    棉花播种前后，张秋香经常出外传授经验，回来以后又忙于招待各地前来参观的人，耽误了一些工作日，有些社员就说：“主任哪！咱们鞋子里的响毛草还没有拔完呢，你可别只顾了别人。”有的看到附近农业社的丰产棉花，长得好，有超过他们的可能。又看到张秋香对这次竞赛中的对手一点也不戒备，反倒挺热心地帮助人家。于是，他们就在背地里叽咕：“人家养猫捉老鼠，咱们养猫咬鸡哩。”
  　不帮助别人就是忘本
    听到这些话以后，张秋香想，有些社员把当前社会主义竞赛的意义搞错了。她经常向社员们讲，现在的丰产竞赛运动，不是一亩、两亩，一社、两社的事，是要促进大家全面增产。一个社获得少数千斤高额丰产田，只不过增加一千斤棉花。现在是要全乡、全县、全省、全国所有棉花都获得高产，这样就能增产成千成万斤棉花。张秋香没有忘记自己的植棉经验是怎样来的。解放前，八里店村农民刘之辉、刘德义、苌月盛、苌月义是务棉的能手，他们各有所长，也各有所短。但在当时，因为个体经济的限制，农民之间互相保密，生怕自己的技术被别人学去。那时，个别人的棉花产量，虽然也曾达到亩产籽棉三百斤以上，但这些经验始终没有在大面积上推广。全村的棉花平均产量只有一百二十多斤。刘锡民老汉为了提高棉花产量，有一次从临潼县“偷”回来一些产量较高的棉花品种，可惜因为他不了解这种棉花的特性及栽培技术，别人又不愿意与他合作，还是没有试种成功。解放以后情况就完全变了，当张秋香开始学习植棉技术的时候，受到一些人的讽刺和打击，也得到不少人的支持和鼓励，而且随着合作化的进展，支持她的人愈来愈多了。党和人民政府大力支持她，帮助解决棉花丰产田所需要的各种物资问题，还派了技术干部帮助他们学技术。许多老农们也来帮助她，张秋香向大家说：“我们不能忘记自己的经验是怎样来的？党扶植了我们，群众帮助了我们，我们不能‘过了河拆桥’，应该积极地帮助其他兄弟农业社。”
    损人利己的人不配参加社会主义竞赛
    一次，张秋香和乡上的棉花评比检查组，检查全乡的丰产棉花。当他们走到张田社妇女主任孙秀云务育的棉花地头时，大家都被这块出色的棉花吸住了：这块棉花长得特别高大，叶子绿汪汪的，又厚又密，像是一湖茂盛的莲叶。当时，许多人称赞这块棉花务的好，可是也有人不表示意见。有个叫刘长发的老汉似乎看出了这块棉花的毛病，而当别人问他时，他又微笑地摇摇头，不肯实说。张秋香看破了刘老汉的心事。她说：“怎么样？不愿意给别人指明缺点吗？社会主义是盼望人人好，不能光戳别人的‘黑窟窿’。指望靠别人的缺点取得胜利的人，就不配参加社会主义竞赛。”接着她直爽地说，这块棉花表面上长得很茂盛，实际上只长枝叶不孕花蕾，如果不立即动手打掐抑制疯长，那就会影响今年的棉花产量。当时，她详细地讲述了抑制棉花疯长的办法，并组织张田社社员立即加工。
    张秋香积极地帮助一般的棉农，也积极地帮助那些技术较好可能超过自己的竞赛对手。双王乡的和平农业社有个青年妇女薛俊秀，聪明能干，她领导的务棉小组从去年开始学习张秋香的植棉技术，头一年达到的产量比张秋香只差三百多斤。有人就背地里议论说：“嗬！薛俊秀真厉害呀，照这样干法，不出两年，保险能压倒张秋香。”八里店农业社的社员们听到这些话，有点不自在，可是张秋香想，要是薛俊秀能赶上自己，更能够打破某些人的保守思想哩！那就说明双王乡的棉花产量还可以继续提高。至于说薛俊秀可能超过自己，她倒很欢迎。以她想：薛俊秀能干，我也不是吃白饭的，你能亩产两千八，我就给你来个亩产三千五。你想超过我，也得好好地出几身汗。这倒是好事情，你走快步，才能逼得我跑步哩！她积极地帮助薛俊秀来赶自己。5月初，薛俊秀的丰产棉花被地老虎咬死了大半，活着的棉花苗也稀稀拉拉，发着黄色，当地老农都认为无法挽救了。几个年轻姑娘急得哭了起来。当薛俊秀提出要去请教张秋香时，几个老头摇了摇头说：“她来也没办法，就是有办法，人家也不来。‘诸葛亮下东吴’，人家为的是啥呀！”薛俊秀想：张秋香要是真心帮助我，在这个关节眼上她不能袖手旁观！她还是去请教张秋香了，张秋香也真的来了。
　　儿子有病是小事薛俊秀的棉花是群众的大事
    半路上，忽然有个熟人说张秋香的儿子病了。张秋香迟疑了一下：究竟去不去看儿子呢？还是到薛俊秀棉田去呢？儿子有病，是家庭小事，薛俊秀的棉花是群众的大事啊！如果这亩丰产棉花试验失败，那双王乡的“老保守”们又该嚼舌头了，这对于国家和人民将是个很大的损失啊！想来想去，最后，她还是下决心跟着薛俊秀去了。她到现场查看了以后，便建议薛俊秀，组织社员迅速移苗，把所缺的苗全部补栽起来。她还亲自教给她们移苗的操作方法和移苗后的田间管理经验。后来，经过七八天的加工加肥，终于把这块棉花救活了。
    帮助了别人也得到了别人的帮助
    张秋香这种大公无私帮助别人的精神，感动了许多人。她帮助了别人，也得到了别人的帮助。附近农民对八里店农业社的棉花也很关心，经常打问张秋香的丰产棉花的生长情况，生怕出了什么岔子。有一次，八里店农业社的大面积丰产棉花发生了虫害，邻地的农业社社员一发现就跑来报告，组织他们联合防治。
