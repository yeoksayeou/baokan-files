Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Tokyo Dispatch: Due to the resistance of Japanese dockworkers, the "Oerlikon 56" missiles purchased by the Japanese "Defense Agency" from Switzerland remain on the "Arima Maru" today and have not been unloaded ashore.

The representatives of the Yokohama Port and Harbor Workers' Union said at the "Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent the Import of 'Oerlikon 56' Missiles," which was attended by representatives from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and many social groups today, "We will fight to the end against unloading missiles."

The dockworkers' heroic struggle has won the support of brother union members. Today, a mass rally was held in Yokohama Park to support the struggle of Yokohama dockworkers. The mood at the meeting was very high. The conference decided that if the Kishida Nobusuke government's "Defense Agency" uses violence to force the unloading of the "Oerlikon 56" missiles on the "Arima Maru," the workers will resist.

    横滨港湾工会代表今天在有共产党、社会党和许多社会团体代表参加的“阻止运进‘厄利康56’型导弹联合斗争会议”上说，“我们将为反对卸运导弹斗争到底”。
    码头工人的英勇斗争获得了兄弟工会会员的支持。今天，在横滨公园举行了声援横滨码头工人斗争的群众大会。会场上的情绪非常昂扬。大会决定，如果岸信介政府的“防卫厅”采取暴力强迫卸运“有马丸”上“厄利康56”型导弹，工人们将进行抵抗。
