    Beijing Mining College Promotes Physical Activities Well
    (Our reporter Guo Jia reports) Physical education activities at Beijing Mining College are well-organized. As of July 31st, 98% of the students (2,892 people) had passed the Labor and Defense System standards; 60% of the students (1,772 people) had reached the level of graded athletes. This number has surpassed the targets of Hefei Mining College and is among the most advanced in physical education in national institutions of higher learning.
    Before March of this year, only 1,560 students in the school had passed the Labor and Defense System standards, accounting for 53% of the total number of 2,949 healthy students in the school; only 97 students were graded athletes, accounting for 3.3% of the total number of healthy students in the school.
    When the great leap forward in sports was first launched in national institutions of higher learning in March this year, the students of Beijing Mining College, under the slogan of "Work healthily for the motherland for fifty years," quickly and extensively launched college-wide mass sports activities. On the other hand, through production practice, they also realized the relationship between physical education and work and study, and deeply realized that as future mining engineers, without a comprehensively developed and strong body, it would be difficult to serve the country's coal industry. Therefore, they more consciously plunged into the upsurge of sports activities. Inspired by the slogan "Strengthen the body, strengthen the will, everyone pass the Labor and Defense System," the students carried out tenacious exercises. Wei Ming, Deputy Secretary of the school's Party Committee, personally took charge and exercised every day; Ge Shouqing, Deputy Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Geology Department, personally served as the captain of the long-distance running team and led the students in long-distance running. Therefore, the students' enthusiasm for exercise became even higher. They are now striving for 100% of the students to pass the Labor and Defense System standards.

    北京矿业学院体育活动搞得好
    本报讯　记者郭家报道：北京矿业学院体育活动搞得好。截至7月31日止，全校已有98％的学生（二千八百九十二人）通过了劳卫制；60％的学生（一千七百七十二人）达到了等级运动员的标准。这个数字已经胜过了合肥矿业学院的指标，列入了全国高等学校体育运动最先进的行列。
    今年3月以前，这个学校通过劳卫制的学生还只有一千五百六十人，占全校健康学生总数二千九百四十九人的53％；等级运动员只有九十七人，占全校健康学生总数的3.3％。
    当今年3月首先在全国高等学校掀起了体育大跃进以后，北京矿业学院的学生在“健康地多为祖国工作五十年”的口号下，迅速、广泛地展开了全院性的群众性体育活动。另方面他们通过生产实习，也体会到体育与工作、学习的关系，深刻认识到作为一个未来的采矿工程师，如果没有全面发展的坚强的身体，是很难为祖国的煤炭工业服务的。因此他们就更自觉地投入了体育运动的热潮。学生们在“强身体，坚意志，人人通过劳卫制”的口号的鼓舞下，进行了顽强的锻炼。学校的党委副书记魏明亲自挂帅，天天锻炼；地质系党总支副书记葛守清亲自担任了长跑队长，率领学生一起长跑，因此学生们锻炼的热情就更高。现在他们正在争取100％的学生通过劳卫制。
