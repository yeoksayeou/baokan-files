Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The China Olympic Committee's statement regarding severing relations with the International Olympic Committee. The full text is as follows:

　　In recent years, under the manipulation of its American chairman, Avery Brundage, the International Olympic Committee has deliberately violated its own solemn charter. In addition to recognizing the only legitimate Olympic Committee of China (All-China Sports Federation), it has also recognized the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique as another Chinese Olympic Committee, creating a "two Chinas" situation. The China Olympic Committee has lodged numerous protests against this, but the International Olympic Committee has blatantly ignored them. In his recent letter to Mr. Dong Shouyi, our member of the International Olympic Committee, Brundage even went further to wantonly insult the Chinese people and openly defended the American occupation of our territory Taiwan and the political conspiracy to create "two Chinas." People have long seen that America's China policy, whether it is non-recognition of New China or the creation of "two Chinas," has completely failed, to the point that the US State Department recently had to issue a memorandum to make a desperate defense. However, the International Olympic Committee is willing to become a tool of this bankrupt American China policy. Under these circumstances, the China Olympic Committee has decided to no longer recognize the International Olympic Committee and to sever all relations with the International Olympic Committee.

　　Facts prove that Brundage's abuse of his power as chairman of the International Olympic Committee to make the International Olympic Committee follow the United States' policy of hostility toward China has been going on for a long time.

　　After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the All-China Sports Federation replaced the original China National Amateur Athletic Federation and became the national sports organization of China. According to the charter of the International Olympic Committee, the All-China Sports Federation is undoubtedly the only legitimate national Olympic Committee of China. However, in order to cooperate with the United States' policy of not recognizing New China and excluding New China from international affairs, Brundage openly declared at the 47th session of the International Olympic Committee in 1952 that although Chinese athletes were allowed to participate in the 15th Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee did not recognize any Chinese national Olympic Committee. Although Brundage attempted to use this arbitrary method to deprive the All-China Sports Federation of its legitimate status as the Chinese national Olympic Committee, at the 49th session of the International Olympic Committee in 1954, thanks to the upholding of justice by many members loyal to the Olympic spirit, the All-China Sports Federation's legitimate status as the Chinese national Olympic Committee was finally confirmed.

　　Brundage's attempt to not recognize the All-China Sports Federation failed, which is an example of the disastrous defeat of the US policy of hostility toward New China in the world. This American policy has not only failed to harm the existence and development of New China in the slightest, but has instead placed the United States itself in an increasingly isolated position. In order to get rid of its passive and isolated situation, especially in order to continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, the United States changed its strategy and actively carried out the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Brundage could not wait to use the International Olympic Committee to pave the way for this American conspiracy. He did not hesitate to violate the principle that only one Olympic Committee can be recognized in a country, and without any discussion or decision by the International Olympic Committee, he illegally recognized the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was spurned by the 600 million Chinese people. He also illegally invited the so-called sports organization of Taiwan to send a sports team to participate in the 16th Olympic Games in 1956 alone, and intolerably changed the name of the People's Republic of China to "Beijing China" and the Chinese province of Taiwan to "Formosa China" at this Olympic Games. The China Olympic Committee lodged a serious protest against this and announced its withdrawal from the 16th Olympic Games.

　　Recently, Brundage has become even more unscrupulous in defending the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and continue to occupy Taiwan. In his letter to Mr. Dong Shouyi, our member of the International Olympic Committee, on January 8th of this year, he absurdly said: "There is a separate government in Taiwan," "Taiwan was last part of Japan, not part of China," "The natives of Taiwan are neither Chinese nor Japanese," and so on. Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation both recognize that Taiwan should be returned to China. In fact, Taiwan has already been returned to China after Japan's surrender. These facts have been repeatedly confirmed even by the US government, which is currently actively creating "two Chinas." Brundage's fallacies cannot change these facts in the slightest. On the contrary, they completely expose him as an imperialist element mixed in international sports organizations serving American political conspiracies.

　　The China Olympic Committee is willing to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee, and has made its best efforts in this regard in the past. However, the Chinese people's position against creating "two Chinas" is unwavering. There is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people absolutely cannot allow a "two Chinas" situation to be created in any international organization, international conference, or international activity. Under the manipulation of Brundage, the International Olympic Committee has openly served the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas," which has destroyed all possibilities for continued cooperation between the China Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. Until the International Olympic Committee corrects its mistakes, revokes its recognition of the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, and effectively upholds its own charter, the China Olympic Committee cannot consider resuming cooperation with the International Olympic Committee.

　　There are many just members in the International Olympic Committee who are truly loyal to the Olympic spirit. We believe that they will support the solemn position of the China Olympic Committee and will do everything possible to free the International Olympic Committee from the control of the dregs of the international sports community and restore its due role in promoting international sports activities.

　　China Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation)

### 中国奥委会严正宣布  同国际奥委会断绝关系  因为它已沦为美国制造“两个中国”的工具

　　中国奥委会严正宣布
    同国际奥委会断绝关系
    因为它已沦为美国制造“两个中国”的工具
    新华社20日讯  中国奥林匹克委员会关于同国际奥林匹克委员会断绝关系的声明。全文如下：
    最近几年来，国际奥林匹克委员会在它的美国主席布伦代奇的操纵下，蓄意违反自己庄严的宪章，在承认了中国唯一合法的奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）之外，竟又承认台湾蒋介石集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”为另一个中国奥林匹克委员会，造成“两个中国”的局面。中国奥林匹克委员会对此曾经提出多次抗议，而国际奥委会竟悍然不顾。布伦代奇在他最近给我国国际奥委会委员董守义先生的来信中，甚至进一步对中国人民肆意污辱，公开为美国霸占我国领土台湾的侵略行为和制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋进行辩护。人们早已看到，美国的对华政策，不论是不承认新中国，或者是制造“两个中国”，都已经彻底破产，以致美国国务院最近不得不发表一个备忘录来进行绝望的辩解。但是，国际奥委会却甘愿沦为美国这种破产的对华政策的工具，在这种情况下，中国奥委会决定不再承认国际奥委会，并且同国际奥委会断绝一切关系。
    事实证明，布伦代奇滥用国际奥委会主席的职权，使国际奥委会亦步亦趋地配合美国敌视中国的政策，已经由来已久。
    1949年中华人民共和国成立以后，中华全国体育总会代替了原来的中华全国体育协进会，成为中国全国性的体育组织，按照国际奥委会的宪章，中华全国体育总会毫无疑问地是中国唯一合法的国家奥委会。但是，为了配合美国不承认新中国并且在国际事务中排斥新中国的政策，布伦代奇在1952年国际奥委会的第四十七届会议上，竟公然声称，虽然中国运动员被允许参加第十五届奥运会，国际奥委会并不承认任何中国国家奥委会。尽管布伦代奇企图用这种专断的办法剥夺中华全国体育总会作为中国国家奥委会的合法地位，但是，在1954年国际奥委会的第四十九届会议上，由于许多忠于奥林匹克精神的委员主持正义，中华全国体育总会作为中国国家奥委会的合法地位终于得到确认。
    布伦代奇不承认中华全国体育总会的企图没有能够得逞，是美国敌视新中国的政策在世界范围内遭到惨败的一个例证。美国这种政策，不仅丝毫没有损害新中国的存在和发展，反而使美国自己陷于越来越孤立的地位。为了摆脱被动和孤立的处境，特别是为了继续霸占中国的领土台湾，美国于是改变了策略，积极进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。布伦代奇也就迫不及待地利用国际奥委会替美国的这个阴谋开辟道路。他不惜破坏在一个国家中只能承认一个奥委会的原则，并且没有经过国际奥委会的任何讨论和决定，非法地承认了被六万万中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”。他又非法地邀请台湾的所谓体育组织单独派出体育队参加1956年第十六届奥运会，并且在这次奥运会上令人不能容忍地把中华人民共和国的名称改为“北京中国”，把中国的台湾省改称为“福摩萨中国”。中国奥委会对此提出了严重的抗议，并且宣布退出第十六届奥运会。
    最近以来，布伦代奇更加肆无忌惮地为美国制造“两个中国”、继续霸占台湾的阴谋辩护。他在今年1月8日给我国国际奥委会委员董守义先生的来信中，竟荒谬地说：“台湾存在着一个单独的政府”，“台湾过去最后是属于日本的一部分，而不是属于中国的”，“台湾本地人既不是中国人，也不是日本人”，等等。台湾是中国的领土。开罗宣言和波茨坦公告都承认台湾应该归还中国。事实上，台湾已经在日本投降后归还中国。这些事实，连目前积极制造“两个中国”的美国政府，也一再确认过。布伦代奇的谬论丝毫改变不了这些事实，相反地，却彻底暴露了他是混在国际体育组织中为美国的政治阴谋服务的一个帝国主义分子。
    中国奥林匹克委员会是愿意同国际奥委会合作的，而且过去在这方面也尽了最大的努力。但是，中国人民反对制造“两个中国”的立场是坚定不移的。世界上只有一个中国，那就是中华人民共和国，中国人民绝对不能容许在任何国际组织、国际会议和国际活动中造成“两个中国”的局面。国际奥委会在布伦代奇的操纵之下，竟公然为美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务，这就破坏了中国奥委会同国际奥委会继续合作的一切可能。在国际奥委会没有改正错误，没有撤销对台湾蒋介石集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”的承认，没有使自己的宪章得到切实的维护以前，中国奥委会无法考虑同国际奥委会重新合作。
    国际奥委会中有不少委员是公正的，是真正忠实于奥林匹克精神的。我们相信，他们一定会支持中国奥委会的严正立场，一定会尽一切努力使国际奥委会摆脱国际体育界败类的控制，重新在促进国际体育活动方面发挥它应有的作用。
    中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）
