　　Meeting Production Needs While Addressing Women's Characteristics
　　Yangjia Cooperative in Liuyang Establishes Women's Specialized Teams

　　Changsha, August 19th (Our Dispatch) - The Yangjia Cooperative in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has established various women's specialized teams according to the needs of production and the characteristics of women, making full use of women's labor. After adopting this new method, the cooperative has achieved a situation where everyone has something to do, everything is taken care of, production plans are all realized, and nothing is missed, ensuring both agricultural production and well-managed sideline production.

　　During the Great Leap Forward in production, the cooperative fully mobilized women to participate in various types of labor according to the needs of production, but the management work did not keep up, and many problems arose. For example, due to the varying physical strengths and technical skills of women, as well as complex situations such as menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, there were many difficulties in arranging women's labor, and the phenomenon of idleness and waste of labor often occurred. At the same time, women's physiological characteristics were not adequately taken into account. In particular, poor production arrangements led to focusing on one thing and neglecting another, resulting in neglecting animal husbandry while busy with water conservancy projects. Of the seventeen production activities that should have been carried out, thirteen were left undone.

　　In light of these circumstances, the cooperative decided to adopt a new method to solve this problem. After repeated research, the cooperative believed that the method adopted last year of dividing labor and industries according to production needs and labor skills to establish specialized organizations was better. This involved dividing male and female labor into various specialized production teams (groups). Some of these specialized teams (groups) were composed of both men and women, while others were mainly composed of women but included individual male members or experienced farmers for technical guidance. These specialized teams are called women's specialized teams. At present, there are a total of eighty-five such women's specialized teams in the cooperative. These teams can be permanent (such as grain production, pig raising, cattle raising, sheep raising, etc.); seasonal (such as afforestation, tea garden cultivation, etc.); or temporary (such as rice transplanting, etc.). The diverse forms are suitable for production needs and take into account the characteristics of women, ensuring that everyone always has work to do.

　　After the establishment of these specialized teams, the labor potential of women has been better realized. Now, all able-bodied women in the cooperative have participated in production, and the number of women regularly working has increased from seventy to three hundred and ninety. Many elderly women in their fifties have also participated in labor within their capabilities. The establishment of specialized teams has also allowed women's skills to be better utilized, making the best use of their talents. For example, Zhou Changxiang's mother, who is fifty-five years old this year, is good at raising pigs, so she was assigned to the specialized team to raise ten pigs. She improved the feeding management methods, increasing the average daily weight gain per pig from seven ounces to eleven ounces. Now she proposes to make the pigs gain a pound a day. After the women's specialized teams were established, all aspects of production in the cooperative were fully developed. Since the beginning of this year, the cooperative's diversified operations have generated an income of 9,000 yuan, which is 2,000 yuan more than the total income of last year. The masses praised the women's specialized teams, saying: "With specialized teams, women are everywhere, seizing gold and silver, and achieving a comprehensive Great Leap Forward."

　　既满足了生产需要  又照顾到妇女特点
　　浏阳杨家社建立妇女专业队
    本报长沙19日电  湖南省浏阳县杨家社根据生产的需要和妇女的特点，组织各种妇女专业队，充分使用妇女劳动力。采用这个新方法后，这个社做到了人人有事做，事事有人做，生产计划样样能实现，项项不落空，既保证了农业生产，又搞好了副业生产。
    在生产大跃进中，根据生产的需要，这个社把妇女充分发动起来参加各种劳动，但是管理工作跟不上，出现了很多问题。例如由于妇女身体强弱不一，技术特长不同，还有经期、孕期、产期和哺乳期等复杂情况，结果在安排妇女劳力时困难很多，“人没事做，事没人做”的窝工浪费现象经常出现。同时妇女的生理特点也得不到适当照顾。特别还由于对生产安排不好，顾此失彼，结果忙了修水利，就丢了饲养业，该开展的十七项生产，就有十三项落了空。
    根据这些情况，社里决定采取新的方法来解决这个问题。经过反复研究，社里认为去年采用的按生产需要、按劳力特长分工分业成立专业组织的办法比较好，这就是把男女劳力划分为各种专业生产队
  （组）。这些专业队（组），有男女联合组成的；也有以妇女为主组成的，但吸收个别男社员或老农参加作技术指导。人们称这种专业队为妇女专业队。目前全社共有这样的妇女专业队八十五个。专业队有常年的（如粮食生产、养猪、养牛、养羊等）；有季节性的（如造林、培育茶园等）；也有临时性的
  （如插秧等），形式多样，既适合生产需要，又照顾了妇女特点，使得每个人经常有工作做。
    这些专业队成立后，使妇女的劳动潜力得到了更好的发挥，现在全社能劳动的妇女都参加了生产，经常出工的妇女已由过去的七十人增加到三百九十人，许多五十多岁的老太太也参加了她们力所能及的劳动。专业队的成立还使妇女的特长得到了更好的发挥，做到人尽其才。如周昌祥的母亲今年五十五岁，善于养猪，便被分配在专业队里饲养十头猪，她改进了饲养管理方法，每头猪每天由长七两肉增加到十一两肉，现在她提出要使猪每天长上一斤肉。妇女专业队建立起来以后，全社各项生产都全面开展起来了。今年以来全社开展的多种经营已收入九千元，比去年的全年收入还多两千元。群众赞扬妇女专业队说：“有了专业队，妇女满天红，抓金又抓银，全面大跃进。”
