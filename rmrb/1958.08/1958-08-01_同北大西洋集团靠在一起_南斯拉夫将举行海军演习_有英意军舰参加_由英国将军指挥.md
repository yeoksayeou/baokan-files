Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st. According to a report in the Soviet "Naval Gazette" today, the West German "Abendpost," citing recent news from Belgrade, stated that the Yugoslav Navy will conduct naval exercises in the central and northern Adriatic Sea in August, with warships from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members Britain and Italy participating. The exercises will be commanded by a British admiral.

According to the "Abendpost," the exercises were initiated by Yugoslavia, with the aim of "protecting convoys going to Yugoslavia from the West." The West German newspaper pointed out that, not counting the 1951 Yugoslav naval exercises, which were attended by British warships but have been kept secret until now, the Yugoslav Navy has not conducted similar exercises since World War II. The newspaper believes that the upcoming exercises in Yugoslavia, with the participation of NATO members, are "highly significant" from a military standpoint.

    同北大西洋集团靠在一起
    南斯拉夫将举行海军演习
    有英意军舰参加　由英国将军指挥
    新华社莫斯科31日电　据苏联“海军报”今天报道，西德的“午报”据刚来自贝尔格莱德的消息说，南斯拉夫海军今年8月间将在亚得里亚海中部和北部进行有北大西洋集团参加国英国和意大利的军舰参加的海军演习。演习将由英国海军上将指挥。
    据“午报”说，这次演习是南斯拉夫倡议进行的，演习的目的是“保护从西方去南斯拉夫的船队”。这家西德报纸指出，如果不算至今还保守秘密的、有英国军舰参加的1951年南斯拉夫海军演习，那末，第二次世界大战以后，南斯拉夫海军还没有进行过类似的演习。这家报纸认为，从军事观点看来，南斯拉夫将举行的有北大西洋集团成员国参加的这个演习是“意味深长的”。
