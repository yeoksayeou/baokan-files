　　Eighty-Year-Old Huang Zhong

　　When the news that the total wheat production had surpassed that of the United States reached the Hongxing Third Cooperative of Chengguan Town, Zhuanglang County, Gansu Province, the cooperative members were extremely happy. They discussed it in the fields and factories, and their enthusiasm for production increased even more. Eighty-year-old Li Wenyuan was particularly delighted. Truly, an old general with undiminished vigor, he redoubled his efforts and joined the wave of vigorously developing local industry. In five days, he single-handedly produced 5,000 jin of "artificial urine," "bone meal," and "chlorine-phosphorus-potassium" and other kinds of indigenous fertilizer. To express his love for the Party and Chairman Mao, this old warrior composed a folk rhyme:

　　I am already eighty years old this year,
　　Having lived through several dynasties,
　　From the Guangxu to the Xuantong reign,
　　And experiencing the Kuomintang reactionaries.
　　Emperors and presidents aplenty,
　　I have personally tasted bitterness, spice, and sweetness.
　　Nothing is higher than the blue sky or bigger than the sea,
　　Nothing is better than the great era of Chairman Mao.
　　The red flag waves, the east wind blows,
　　This old Huang Zhong wants to live past a hundred years.
　　Eating rice, don't forget the rice growers,
　　The road to happiness was opened by the Communist Party.
　　Gansu Zhuanglang Hongxing Third Cooperative Accountant

　　八十老黄忠
    当小麦总产超过美国的消息传到甘肃庄浪县城关镇红星三社后，社员们都高兴极了，在田地里工厂里谈论着这件事，生产热情更加高涨。八十岁的李文源老大爷更是欣喜异常，真是宝刀不老，他一鼓干劲，也投入到大办地方工业的浪潮中去。五天的时间，他一人就制造出“人造尿”、“骨粉”、“氯磷钾”等土化肥五千斤。这位老将为了表达自己热爱党和毛主席，作了一首顺口溜：
  我今年已经八十岁，
  经过了好几个朝代，
  从光绪到宣统，
  经过国民党反动派。
  皇帝总统好几个，
  我亲口尝过苦辣和甜酸。
  高不过蓝天大不过海，
  好不过毛主席的伟大时代。
  红旗招展东风吹，
  我这老黄忠还要活过一百岁。
  吃米不忘种谷人，
  幸福道路是共产党开。
      甘肃庄浪红星三社会计
                  李仲江
