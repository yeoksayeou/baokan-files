Editor's Note: Since this newspaper published the news and commentary about U.S. President Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations General Assembly emergency session on August 13 and the U.S. State Department's so-called memorandum of "non-recognition of China," the editorial department has received many letters from readers expressing great indignation at the U.S. government's shameless lies to cover up its crimes of aggression in the Middle East and its fallacies of hostility towards the people of our country, demanding that these two materials be published in full so that the broad masses of readers can more profoundly recognize the ugly face of U.S. imperialism. We fully agree with these opinions of our readers and are publishing the full text of the above two materials today and tomorrow.

It has been nearly five years since I last had the honor of speaking before the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, I spoke about the problem of atomic energy and advocated that we all come up with a way to prevent mankind's miraculous inventive ability from being used to kill them, but rather to contribute to their lives. Since then, great progress has been made in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Unfortunately, to date, almost nothing has been done to prohibit the use of atomic and nuclear energy for weapons purposes.

This is a danger.

Robber Logic
Arson Legal, Firefighting Illegal

This danger gives rise to another danger, namely, that countries led by aggressive figures attempt to exploit people's fear of war to force countries, especially small countries, to make an obvious choice between abject surrender and war.

In the recent Middle East crisis, this tactic has emerged again.

Some might call it "ballistic blackmail."

In most societies, shouting "fire" in a crowded hall is illegal. Shouldn't creating the fear of a major war to achieve political goals in a region be considered a serious international misbehavior?

Pressure like this will never succeed with the United States, but it does create a danger that can affect every one of us. That is why I am asking to speak to you again.

The immediate cause is two small countries—Lebanon and Jordan.

This is a matter of universal concern.

The legitimate, freely elected government of Lebanon, feeling threatened by an externally instigated civil war, made a desperate appeal to the United States for immediate assistance. We responded to this appeal.

Based on the response to this appeal, efforts have been made to create war hysteria. This is done to create the impression that helping small countries achieve their desire for survival endangers peace.

This is truly a "reversal of right and wrong." If helping small countries maintain their independence becomes an international crime, then the possibility of conquest is indeed limitless. We would thus invalidate the provision in our Charter that recognizes the inherent right to collective self-defense. We will allow forces capable of causing great catastrophe to do whatever they want.

Of course, the primary responsibility of the United Nations is not only to maintain international peace but also to maintain "security." This is an important fact. But we must not evade the second fact, which is that in the world situation since 1945, the United Nations' efforts to fulfill this responsibility have sometimes been hindered.

Reversing Black and White
Every Debt of Aggression is Forcefully Claimed as a Benevolent Act

Respect for the freedom of the people of all countries has always been a guiding principle of the United States. Consistent with this respect is our unwavering adherence to the principles of the Charter, especially the parts that oppose direct or indirect aggression. Sometimes we have demonstrated this through the collective measures required by the United Nations. Sometimes we have demonstrated this according to the "inherent right to collective self-defense" mentioned in the Charter.

I recall the moments of clear danger we have faced since the end of World War II—Iran, Greece and Turkey, the Berlin Blockade, Korea, the Taiwan Strait.

In all these situations, a common principle guided the attitude of the United States. This principle is: aggression, whether direct or indirect, must be stopped before it gains sufficient strength to destroy us all—aggressors and defenders alike.

Responding to the urgent appeals of the governments of Lebanon and Jordan is another application of this principle.

I would not be frank with you if I did not say that the United States reserves the right, within the spirit of the United Nations Charter, to respond to legitimate appeals from any country, especially small countries.

I do not believe that any free government in the world would be willing to give up the right to ask for help when its sovereignty is threatened.

But, I must emphasize again, the United States has always sought to act within the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

For example, when President Truman responded to the urgent appeal of Greece in 1947, the United States stipulated that we would withdraw our aid when the United Nations believed that its actions could replace ours.

Similarly, when the United States responded to the urgent appeal of Lebanon, we immediately went to the Security Council, asking the United Nations to provide assistance to Lebanon so that U.S. troops could withdraw.

If two draft resolutions (one proposed by the United States and one proposed by the Japanese government) had not failed to pass due to one negative vote—a veto—the United Nations would have taken action long ago, and U.S. troops would have withdrawn long ago.

But nothing I have said should be considered as indicating that I consider the status quo to be sacrosanct. Indeed, change is the law of life and progress. But if change reflects the will of the people, then it can, and should, be achieved peacefully.

In this regard, the United States respects the right of every Arab country in the Near East to live in freedom without being ruled by any power, whether distant or near.

It is also in this regard that we believe that the United Nations Charter places certain solemn obligations on all of us. If we do not respect each other's sovereignty and are not cautious in using the means to achieve new ways of international life, then the prospects for peace outlined in the Charter will become a joke.

Applying Makeup
Defending the U.S. and British Aggression in the Middle East

Let me now turn specifically to the issue of Lebanon.

After U.S. military assistance began to enter Lebanon, I reported to the American people that we had responded immediately to Lebanon's request because the situation had reached a point where only immediate action would suffice.

I reiterate to you the solemn assurance I made at that time: our aid to Lebanon has only one purpose—that is, the purpose of the United Nations Charter and the purpose of historic United Nations resolutions such as the 1949 "Essentials of Peace" resolution and the 1950 "Uniting for Peace" resolution. These resolutions condemn the incitement of civil war for the benefit of a foreign power, saying that it is a form of aggression and an international crime.

We want to prevent that crime—or at least prevent it from having extremely harmful consequences. We have no other purpose than this.

Whenever the legally constituted government of Lebanon requests it, or whenever, through action by the United Nations or otherwise, Lebanon is no longer subject to the original danger, all U.S. troops will withdraw.

I sincerely hope that this General Assembly, not subject to the veto, will consider how it can ensure that Lebanon continues to maintain its independence and integrity so that the political destiny of the Lebanese people remains in their own hands.

The U.S. delegation will support measures taken for this purpose.

Another urgent issue is Jordan.

If we do not take immediate action in Jordan, another dangerous crisis may arise, because the methods of indirect aggression that can be observed in Jordan may lead to conflicts that endanger peace.

We must recognize that peace in this region is fragile, and we must recognize that if peace in Jordan collapses, it may have far-reaching consequences. The United Nations has a special responsibility in this matter, because the Palestine Armistice Agreement, on which peace in this region depends, was initiated by it, and because the work of caring for Palestinian refugees was also initiated by it.

I hope that this General Assembly will be able to concretely express the United Nations' concern for maintaining peace in Jordan.

Borrowing a Knife to Kill
Attempting to Use the United Nations as a Tool of Aggression

There is another issue that the General Assembly should face squarely when trying to promote stability in the Near East. That is the issue of inflammatory propaganda. The United Nations General Assembly has three times—in 1947, 1949, and 1950—passed resolutions to stop one country from broadcasting irresponsible broadcasts into the homes of citizens of other countries, thereby "inciting civil war in any country and undermining the will of the people." That is what the resolutions said. We all know that in the Near East, there have recently been many violations of these resolutions.

If we Americans are wrong, we are prepared to correct our mistakes.

I believe that this General Assembly should reaffirm the policies it has declared, and should consider what methods to use to listen to those radio broadcasts targeting other countries in the troubled region of the Near East, and what methods to study the complaints raised by countries that believe their national security is being harmed by external propaganda.

The countries in this region should also be freed from armed pressure and infiltration from outside their borders. When there is a crisis of such interference, they should be able to enable the United Nations to take immediate and effective action to help defend their independence. This requires adequate institutions to enable people to clearly see the presence of the United Nations in troubled areas.

Therefore, I believe that this General Assembly should take action aimed at creating a standing United Nations peacekeeping force. Recent events that have brought the integrity of our two member states into imminent danger clearly demonstrate the need for such a force.

I understand that this general issue will be discussed at the thirteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, and I understand that our highly respected Secretary-General has already put forward initiatives in this regard. Recent events clearly demonstrate that this is a matter that requires urgent and positive action.

I have put forward four areas of action for the General Assembly to consider, namely, in Lebanon, Jordan, subversive propaganda, and a standing United Nations force. These measures are essentially aimed at achieving one thing: safeguarding the right of a country and its people to determine their own destiny in accordance with the obligation to respect the rights of other countries.

This clearly applies to the great wave of Arab nationalism.

Allow me to state clearly the attitude of my country. The people of the Arab countries of the Near East clearly have the right to determine and express their own destiny. As long as this expression is in accordance with international peace and security, other countries should not interfere.

Hypocritical Benevolence
Using Dollars to Deceive the People of the Middle East

But here, as in other regions, we have the opportunity to share a great international mission. That is to help them further toward the goals of human happiness they have identified, according to the plans that the people of that region may desire. Truly independent governments can only sustain themselves on the basis of a constantly developing economy.

This is a real challenge to the people of the Arab countries, and to all of us.

To help the Arab countries achieve these aspirations, I propose the following:

First, the Secretary-General should immediately consult with the Arab countries of the Near East to determine whether agreement can be reached on the establishment of an Arab Development Institution on a regional basis.

Second, these consultations could consider the composition of the regional Arab Development Institution and the possible roles it could play. The task of this institution would be to accelerate development in areas such as industry, agriculture, water supply, health, and education.

Third, consultations should also be held at the appropriate time with other countries and private groups that may be prepared to support this institution.

If the Arab countries agree that such a well-organized regional institution is beneficial, and if they are prepared to support this institution with their own resources, the United States is also prepared to support this institution.

The purpose of establishing this institution is to provide loans to the Arab countries and to provide the technical assistance needed in formulating development plans.

This institution should be managed by the Arab countries themselves.

I believe that this proposal regarding the establishment of a regional Arab Development Institution can be realized on a basis that will attract international capital—both public and private.

I also believe that the best and quickest way to achieve the most favorable results is for the Secretary-General to proceed on two fronts. First, to consult with the Arab countries of the Near East to ascertain the scope of agreement. Then, to invite the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has extensive experience in this area, to provide its facilities to plan the organizational and operational methods needed to gradually establish this institution.

I hope everyone understands that I am not suggesting that my own country take the lead in establishing this institution. If this institution is to succeed, the Arab countries themselves must take the lead.

I hope that this institution will give priority to taking action to address one of the major problems in the Near East, namely, the common and serious anxiety—water scarcity.

In terms of water conservancy development, a great deal of scientific and engineering work is already underway. For example, atomic isotopes can now enable us to plan the courses of underground rivers. New fields have also been opened in desalting saltwater. The water problem that has existed since ancient times has now reached the threshold of being solved. Energy, determination, and science can help it cross this threshold.

Another serious problem in this region is disease.

The people and governments of the Near East countries have already made great efforts to eradicate disease and disability. But there is still much work to be done.

The United States is willing to work with other national governments and the World Health Organization to conduct a comprehensive and joint effort in the Near East to eradicate preventable diseases.

But seeing the desert bloom again and preventable diseases eradicated is only the first step. As I look to the future, I see the rise of modern Arab countries, whose contributions to this century will exceed the contributions of the past that we cannot forget. We remember that much of Western arithmetic and algebra is due to Arab mathematicians, and that the foundations of world medicine and astronomy were largely laid by Arab scholars. In particular, we remember that three of the world's great religions originated in the Near East.

But a true Arab renaissance can only develop in the context of a healthy humanity. Material progress itself should not become an overriding goal, but rather an important condition for achieving higher human, cultural, and spiritual goals.

But I repeat, if this vision of a modern Arab society is to be realized, the goals must be Arab goals.

With the help of the United Nations, the countries of the Near East now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to freely strengthen their security and promote their political and economic interests. If the peace plan that I am now proposing can be implemented, then in just a few years we will be able to look back on the crises in Lebanon and Jordan and see it as the beginning of a great new era in Arab history.

But there is one important development that must be remembered today and in the future.

If external interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries of the Near East can be stopped;

If there is an adequate United Nations peacekeeping force;

If there is a regional development institution, and that institution is carrying out basic projects and plans aimed at improving the living standards of the people in the region;

Then, with this good vision, and in fact as a necessary condition for achieving this vision, I hope and believe that the countries in this region will no longer feel the need, spiritually and emotionally, to seek national security through a spiral of increasing military strength, which would not only make them economically weak but also lead to war.

Perhaps the countries involved in the 1948 hostilities may wish to request the United Nations to investigate the situation of heavy armaments entering those countries as a first step. My country is willing to support the establishment of an appropriate United Nations body to investigate this issue. This body should discuss with these countries individually to see what kind of arms monitoring arrangements can be made so that the security of all these countries can be more effectively maintained than in the case of continuing a wasteful and dangerous arms race. I believe that any such agreement must reflect the views of these countries themselves.

Ferocious Appearance Revealed
Putting Forward Six Aggressive Plans

I have tried to give you an outline of a plan for peace in the Near East, a plan that will establish a political order that is in accordance with the rights of all peoples; it will avoid the dangers of a regional arms race; it will enable the people of the Near East to wholeheartedly devote their energy to development tasks and to the pursuit of human progress in the broadest sense.

It is important that these six elements of the plan be seen as a whole. They are:

(1) The United Nations' concern for Lebanon.

(2) United Nations measures to maintain peace in Jordan.

(3) Stop internal strife incited from the outside.

(4) A United Nations peacekeeping force.

(5) A regional economic development plan aimed at helping and accelerating the improvement of the living standards of the people of these Arab countries.

(6) Take steps to prevent a new spiral of arms races in this region.

To be firmly linked together, each element of this plan for peace and progress should be considered and voted on as a whole, as an indivisible element of a concerted effort.

Therefore, I hope that this General Assembly will seek to simultaneously take measures that are in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and can create an atmosphere of security in the Near East, while also establishing an organization for joint efforts to improve the living standards of the people of the Arab countries.

But the people of the Near East countries with aspirations for independence and development are not alone. We live in an era in which the whole world has recognized the possibility of modernizing their societies.

Deceiving the World
Saying Economic Plunder is Economic Assistance

The U.S. government has been continuously expanding appropriations for foreign economic development to meet this worldwide hope. We have been cooperating with groups such as the Organization of American States and the Colombo Plan; we are studying ways to strengthen these regional arrangements. For example, with the Organization of American States, we are consulting with our sister republics in this hemisphere to strengthen its role in economic development. It is not only the U.S. government that is supporting development efforts. The Commonwealth countries, Western European countries, and Japan have all made significant contributions.

But in many parts of the world, whether from a geographical point of view or from a sensible economic plan, a national development plan is better than a regional development plan. The United States will certainly continue to firmly support such national plans. Only where the desire to take a regional approach is clearly expressed, only where a regional plan is clearly superior to a national plan, will the United States turn to a regional approach.

The United States is proud of the scale and diversity of its development activities around the world. Those who know our history will recognize that this is not a sudden new policy of our government. Since the founding of the United States, it has been happy to share its wealth with other countries. It does this without seeking to conquer or economically dominate others. After winning two world wars and spending vast amounts of wealth, no one can find, on the world map showing geographical conditions or economic conditions, that the power of American weapons or the power of American wealth has annexed any foreign territory or political or economic system. Because we cherish our freedom, we also advocate freedom for other countries.

The things I have talked about today are real and waiting for us to understand. Within the scope of the Near East and within the scope of this General Assembly, there are the forces of reason, self-restraint, and wisdom that can patiently lay the foundation for the political order and peace of that region over time.

But we also know that the nuclear weapons arms race casts a shadow over all these possibilities, dims all our hopes, consumes our best talents and vast resources, and makes the nerves of our people tense.

In this General Assembly, many of you represent new countries. As I look around the General Assembly, one thought is particularly moving to me.

This world that is changing the face of our planet will become a world composed of many mature countries.

As these emerging countries go through difficult transition periods one by one and become modernized countries and learn how to grow, higher prosperity and productivity will emerge from this pain.

This world composed of individual countries will not be controlled by any great power or group of great powers. This world will not adhere to any one ideology.

Believe my words: the dream of a world dominated by one great power or a world of uniformity is an impossible dream.

The nature of today's weapons, the nature of modern transportation, and the expansion of the circle of emerging countries clearly show that we must ultimately be a world family composed of a community that everyone can participate in.

The concept of a community that everyone can participate in is the final key to an arms control system that we can all trust.

Therefore, we must seek with new energy and new creativity the path to such a peace, a peace that is based on effective control of armaments, economic progress, and the freedom of the people of all countries to be governed by governments of their choice. Only in this way can we use all the abilities given to us by God to enrich the lives of individuals, who are our ultimate concern, our responsibility, and our strength.

To accomplish this great task, leaders everywhere have much to do, their energy can be fully exerted, and their ambitions can be fully rewarded.

专栏：

　　艾森豪威尔主义的新版
    美国总统在联大紧急会议上的演说全文
    编者按  自从本报登载了关于美国总统艾森豪威尔8月13日在联合国大会紧急会议上的演说和美国国务院的所谓“不承认中国”的备忘录的新闻和评论以后，编辑部接到许多读者来信，对美国政府掩饰侵略中东罪行的无耻谎言和敌视我国人民的谬论表示极大的愤慨，要求把这两个材料全文发表，使广大读者更加深刻地认清美国帝国主义的丑恶的面目。我们完全赞成读者的这些意见，特于今明两日分别全文发表上述两个材料。
    自从我上次荣幸地在联合国大会发言以来已经将近有五年了。当时我谈到了原子能问题，并且主张我们大家想出个办法来使人类的奇迹般的发明能力不致被用来杀害他们，而是用来为他们的生活作出贡献。自从那时以来，在把原子能用于和平方面已经取得了巨大的进展。不幸的是，到现在为止，在禁止原子能和核能用于武器目的方面差不多还没有做什么工作。
    这是一种危险。
    强盗逻辑
    放火合法  救火非法
    这种危险又引起了另一种危险，那就是，在侵略性的人物领导下的国家企图利用人们对战争的恐惧心理，要各国、特别是小国在乖乖地投降和战争两者之间作一个明显的选择。
    在最近的中东危机中，又一次出现了这种策略。
    有人可能把它叫作“弹道讹诈”。
    在大多数社会里，在人群拥挤的会场上叫喊“失火”是非法的。为了在一个地区达到政治目的而制造大战的恐惧难道不应该被认为是严重的国际不轨行为吗？
    像这样的压力对于美国是决不会成功的，但是这种压力的确造成能够影响我们每一个人的危险。这就是为什么我再次要求向你们说话的原因。
    当前的原因是两个小国——黎巴嫩和约旦。
    这是一件举世关心的事情。
    黎巴嫩合法的、通过自由选举产生的政府，由于感到自己受到了由外部煽动起来的内战的威胁，向美国发出了绝望的呼吁，要求立即给予援助。我们响应了这个呼吁。
    在这种呼吁得到响应的基础上，出现了制造战争歇斯底里的努力。这样做是为了造成这样一种印象：如果帮助小国实现它们希望求得生存的愿望，那就要危及和平。
    这真正是一种“颠倒是非”的说法。如果帮助小国维持独立成为国际罪行，那么，征服的可能性的确是无限了。我们这样做将使得我们宪章中承认集体自卫的固有权利的规定归于无效。我们将使能够造成巨大灾祸的力量可以为所欲为。
    当然，联合国主要责任是不仅维持国际和平并且维持“安全”。这是一个重要的事实。但是我们决不能回避第二个事实，这就是在1945年以来的世界局势中，联合国为了履行它的这个职责而作的努力有时遭到过阻挠。
    颠倒黑白
    笔笔侵略债  硬说是善行
    尊重一切国家人民的自由一向是美国的指导原则。一贯表明这种尊重的是我们坚持不渝地遵守宪章的原则，特别是其中反对直接的或间接的侵略的部分。有时我们通过联合国所要求采取的集体措施表明了这一点。有时我们根据宪章所说的“集体自卫的固有权利”表明了这一点。
    我想起自从第二次世界大战结束以来我们所面临的清楚的危险的时刻——伊朗、希腊和土耳其、柏林封锁、朝鲜、台湾海峡。
    在所有这些情况中，一项共同的原则指导着美国的态度。这项原则是：侵略，不论是直接的或间接的侵略，必须加以制止，以免它获得充分的力量而使我们大家——侵略者和守卫者——同归于尽。
    在响应黎巴嫩和约旦的政府的紧急呼吁时就是再一次应用了这项原则。
    如果我不对诸位说，美国在联合国宪章精神内保留了响应任何国家特别是小国的合法呼吁的权利，那我就是不坦率了。
    我不相信世界上有哪一个自由政府会愿意放弃在它的主权受到危害时要求帮助的权利。
    但是，我必须再度强调，美国始终设法在联合国宪章的精神以内行事。
    例如，当杜鲁门总统在1947年响应希腊的紧急呼吁时，美国规定当联合国认为它的行动能够代替我们的行动时，我们就撤回我们的援助。
    同样，当美国响应黎巴嫩的紧急呼吁时，我们立即前往安全理事会，要求联合国对黎巴嫩提供援助，以使美国军队能够撤退。
    若不是两个决议草案（美国提出的一个和日本政府提出的一个）由于一张反对票——一张否决票——而未能通过，联合国早已采取了行动，美国军队早已撤退。
    但是我所说的话中，没有一点可以被认为是表示我认为现状是神圣不可侵犯的。的确，变化是人生和进步的法则。但是如果变化反映了人民的意愿，那末就能够、而且也应当以和平方式实现这种变化。
    在这方面，美国尊重近东每一个阿拉伯国家在自由中生活而不受任何远的或近的方面的统治的权利。
    也是在这方面，我们认为联合国宪章使我们全体都负有某种庄严的义务。如果不尊重彼此的主权，在运用实现新的国际生活方式的手段时不谨慎从事，那么宪章所规划的和平前景就会成为一种笑柄。
    涂脂抹粉
    替美英侵略中东辩解
    让我现在转而具体地谈到黎巴嫩问题。
    在美国的军事援助开始进入黎巴嫩之后，我就向美国人民报告我们已经立即响应了黎巴嫩的请求，因为局势到了只有立即采取行动才行的地步。
    我再一次向你们重复我在那个时候提出的庄严保证：我们对黎巴嫩的援助只有一个目的——那就是联合国宪章的目的和像1949年的“和平要素”决议和1950年的“保障和平的联合行动”决议这些具有历史意义的联合国决议的目的。这些决议谴责为了某一个外国的利益而煽起内战的行为，说这是一种形式的侵略行为和一种国际罪行。
    我们想要防止那种罪行——至少是防止它产生极其有害的后果。我们除此之外再没有其他的目的了。
    不论什么时候，只要合法组成的黎巴嫩政府提出要求，或者是只要通过联合国或者其他方面的行动，黎巴嫩不再遭受原来的危险，美国军队就将全部撤退。
    我真诚地希望不受否决权影响的本大会将考虑它怎样才能够保证黎巴嫩继续保持独立和完整以便黎巴嫩人民的政治命运仍然掌握在他们自己的手中。
    美国代表团将支持为了这个目的而采取的措施。
    另一个迫切的问题是约旦。
    如果我们在约旦不立即采取行动，可能产生另一个危险的危机，因为在约旦可以察觉到的间接侵略的方法可能导致危及和平的冲突。
    我们必须认识到，这个地区的和平是脆弱的，我们也必须认识到约旦的和平如果完蛋可能会产生影响深远的后果。联合国在这个问题上负有特别责任，因为这个地区的和平所依靠的巴勒斯坦停战协定是它发起的，因为照料巴勒斯坦难民的工作也是它发起的。
    我希望本大会将能够使联合国对维持约旦和平的关心得到具体表现。
    借刀杀人
    企图利用联合国作侵略工具
    大会在设法促进近东稳定时还有一个应当正视的问题。那就是煽动性宣传问题。联合国大会曾经三次——1947年、1949年和1950年——通过决议要制止一个国家向其他国家公民的家里播送不负责任的广播，从而“在任何国家煽起内战和败坏人民的意志。”决议就是这样说的。我们都知道在近东，最近有人在许多方面违反了这些决议。
    如果我们美国错了，我们准备纠正错误。
    我认为，本大会应当重申它宣布的政策，并且应当考虑用什么方法来收听针对近东多事地区中的其他国家的那些无线电广播，用什么方法来研究那些认为自己的国家安全受到外部宣传危害的国家所提出的控诉。
    还应该使这个地区的国家摆脱来自它国境以外的武装压力和渗入。当有进行这种干涉的危机的时候，它们应当能够使联合国立即采取有效的行动来帮助保卫它们的独立。这就要求有充分的机构来使人们能够明白看到联合国在多事地区的存在。
    因此，我相信，本大会应该采取旨在创建一支常备联合国和平部队的行动。最近发生的使我们两个会员国的完整遭到迫在眉睫的危险的事件清楚表明，需要成立这样一支部队。
    我了解，这个总的问题将在第十三届联合国大会会议讨论，并且了解，我们的声誉卓著的秘书长已经在这方面提出倡议。最近的事件清楚表明，这是需要采取紧急和积极的行动的问题。
    我已经提出四个行动方面供大会考虑，那就是在黎巴嫩、约旦、颠复宣传以及联合国常备部队方面。这些措施基本上是要实现一件事情：维护一个国家和它的人民在符合尊重他国权利的义务的情况下决定自己命运的权利。
    这显然适用于伟大的阿拉伯民族主义浪潮。
    请允许我明确地叙述我国的态度。近东各阿拉伯国家的人民显然拥有决定和表现自己命运的权利。只要这种表现符合国际和平和安全，其他国家就不应当干涉。
    假仁假义
    拿美元欺骗中东人民
    但是，这里和在其他地区一样，我们有机会分担一个伟大的国际任务。那就是根据那个地区的人民可能希望的计划帮助他们进一步走向他们已经确定的人类幸福的目标。真正独立的政府只有在不断发展的经济的基础上才能维持自己。
    这是对阿拉伯国家的人民以及对我们大家的一个真正的挑战。
    为了帮助阿拉伯国家实现这些愿望，我提出以下建议：
    第一，秘书长应该立即同近东阿拉伯国家进行磋商，以确定能否就在区域性基础上建立阿拉伯发展机构问题达成协议。
    第二，这些磋商可以考虑区域性阿拉伯发展机构的组成以及可能发挥的作用，这个机构的任务将是加速工业、农业、水利供应、卫生以及教育等方面的发展。
    第三，还应当在适当时候同可能准备支持这个机构的其他国家和私人团体进行磋商。
    如果阿拉伯国家一致认为这种组织健全的区域性机构是有益的，如果它们准备以自己的资源支持这个机构的话，美国也准备支持这一机构。
    建立这个机构的目的是为了向阿拉伯国家提供贷款以及提供在制定发展计划时所需的技术援助。
    这个机构应当由阿拉伯国家自己来管理。
    我相信，关于设立一个区域性阿拉伯发展机构的这个建议能够在一种会吸引国际资本——公共的和私人的资本——的基础上实现。
    我也相信，要得到最相宜的结果，最好和最迅速的办法是由秘书长分两头来进行。首先是同近东阿拉伯国家进行磋商，以便探明协议的范围。然后邀请在这方面有丰富经验的国际复兴开发银行提供它的便利条件来筹划为了逐步建立这个机构所需要的组织上和工作上的方法。
    我希望大家都明白，我并不是建议我自己的国家在建立这种机构的工作中居于领导地位。如果要使这个机构成功，必须由阿拉伯国家自己来起领导作用。
    我希望这个机构优先考虑采取行动对付近东重大的问题之一，也就是共同的严重恐慌——水荒。
    在水利发展方面，现在已经在进行不少科学上和工程上的工作。例如，现在原子同位素可以使我们能够规划地下大河的河道。在使咸水变淡方面也打开了新的领域。自古以来的水的问题现在已经到了得到解决的门槛上。精力、决心和科学能够帮助它跨过这个门槛。
    这个地区的另一个严重问题是疾病。
    近东各国人民和政府现在已经作了巨大的努力来扑灭疾病和残废。但是还有许多工作要做。
    美国愿意同其他国家政府和世界卫生组织一起在近东进行全面的、共同的努力来扑灭可以预防的疾病。
    但是看到沙漠再度遍地开花和可以预防的疾病被扑灭只不过是第一步。我在瞻望未来的时候，看到现代阿拉伯国家的兴起，这些国家对本世纪作出的贡献将超过我们所不能忘记的过去的贡献。我们记得西方的算术和代数有很大部分要归功于阿拉伯数学家，世界医学和天文学的基础有很大部分是由阿拉伯学者奠定的。尤其是，我们记得世界上的伟大的宗教中有三个宗教起源于近东。
    但是，只有在一种健康的人性的背景下，真正的阿拉伯文艺复兴才能发展。物质进步本身不应当成为超越一切的目标，而是达到更高的人性的、文化的、精神的目标的一个重要条件。
    但是我重复一遍，如果要实现这种现代化阿拉伯社会的远景，目标必须是阿拉伯的目标。
    在联合国的帮助下，近东国家现在有着千载难逢的机会可以自由地加强它们的安全和促进它们的政治和经济利益。如果我现在所建议的那种和平计划能够实行，那么在短短的几年之后，我们就能够在回顾黎巴嫩和约旦的危机时把它看作是阿拉伯历史上伟大的新时代的开始。
    但是，有一个在今天和今后都必须记住的重要发展。
    如果对近东阿拉伯国家内政的外来干涉得以停止；
    如果存在着一支充分的联合国和平部队；
    如果存在着一个区域性发展机构，而且这个机构在进行旨在提高这个地区的生活水平的基本工程和计划；
    那么，有了这个良好的远景，而且事实上作为达到这个远景的一个必要条件，我希望并且相信，这个地区的国家在精神上和情感上都不会再感到有必要通过螺旋形地加强军事力量来谋求国家的安全，加强军事力量不仅会使得在经济上软弱无力而且会导致战争。
    也许，卷入1948年敌对行动的那些国家作为第一步可能希望要求联合国调查重型军备运入那些国家的情况。我的国家愿意支持建立一个适当的联合国机构来调查这个问题。这个机构应同这些国家个别地进行讨论，看一看能够订出什么样的军备监督安排，来使所有这些国家的安全能够比在继续进行浪费金钱的危险的军备竞赛的情况下更为有效地得到维护。我认为，任何这样的协定必须反映这些国家自己的观点。
    凶相毕露
    搬出六点侵略性计划
    我已试图向你们提出一个近东和平计划的梗概，这个计划将建立一个符合各国人民权利的政治秩序；它将避免区域性武装竞赛的危险；它将使近东各国人民能够全心全意地用他们的力量来从事开发任务和追求最广泛意义的人类进步。
    重要的是，应当把这个计划的六个因素看作是一个整体。它们是：
    （一）联合国对黎巴嫩的关心。
    （二）联合国维护约旦的和平的措施。
    （三）停止从外部煽动的内争。
    （四）一支联合国和平部队。
    （五）一个目的在于帮助和加速改善这些阿拉伯国家的人民的生活水平的区域性经济发展计划。
    （六）采取步骤防止在这个地区发生新的武装竞赛螺旋。
    为了牢牢结合在一起，这个争取和平和进步的计划的各个因素应当像一个协力一致的努力的不可分割的因素一样，作为整体来加以考虑和表决。
    因此，我希望本大会将设法同时采取符合联合国宪章原则的、可以在近东创造一种安全气氛的一些措施，同时又建立一个进行共同努力的组织来提高阿拉伯各国人民的生活水平。
    但是具有独立和发展的抱负的近东各国人民并不是孤独的。我们生活在一个全世界都已经认识到有可能使它们的社会现代化的时代。
    欺世盗名
    经济掠夺说成经济援助
    美国政府一直在不断地扩大用于外国经济发展的拨款，以满足这种世界范围的希望。我们已经同像美洲国家组织和科伦坡计划这种集团实行合作；我们正在研究加强这些区域性安排的方法。譬如就拿美洲国家组织来说，我们正在同本半球的我们的姊妹共和国进行磋商来加强它在经济发展中的作用。支持发展努力的不单是美国政府。英联邦国家、西欧国家和日本都作出了重大的贡献。
    但是在世界的许多地方，不管是从地理情况来说，还是从明智的经济计划来说，都是一国发展计划比区域性发展计划好。美国当然会继续坚决支持这种一国计划。只有在希望采取区域性办法的愿望清楚地表现出来的地方，只有在区域性的计划明显地胜过一国计划的地方，美国才会转而采取区域性的方法。
    美国对它在世界各地进行的发展活动的规模和多样性感到自豪。那些知道我们历史的人们将会认识到这不是我国政府的突如其来的新政策，美国自从立国以来一直乐于同其他国家分享它的财富。它这样作并不想征服或在经济上统治他人。在两次世界大战中获胜并且支出了巨大财富以后，不论是在表明地理状况还是表明经济状况的世界地图上，谁也不能发现美国武器的威力或者美国财富的力量已经并吞了任何外国领土或者政治或经济体系。因为我们珍视我们的自由，我们也主张给其他国家以自由。
    今天我所谈到的事情是现实的，等待我们去理解。在近东范围内和在本大会范围内，存在着理智、自制和智慧的力量，可以随着时间耐心地奠定那个地区的政治秩序及和平的基础。
    但是我们也知道，核武器军备竞赛给所有这一切可能性罩上暗影，使我们的一切希望暗淡了，这种竞赛耗尽我们最优秀的人才和广大资源，使我们各国人民神经紧张。
    在本大会，诸位当中有许多人代表着新国家。当我环顾大会时，有一种想法特别使我感慨。
    正在我们星球上改变面貌的这个世界将成为一个由许多成熟的国家组成的世界。
    随着这些新兴国家逐一经历困难的过渡时期而成为现代化国家并且学会成长的方法，更高度的繁荣和生产力将会从这种阵痛中出现。
    这个由各别的国家组成的世界不会受到任何大国或大国集团的控制。这个世界不会信奉任何一种意识形态。
    请相信我的话：由一个大国独霸世界的梦想或世界一律的梦想是不可能实现的梦想。
    今天的武器的性质、现代化交通的性质和新兴国家圈子的扩大清楚地说明：我们到头来必须是一个由人人可以参加的团体组成的世界大家庭。
    人人可以参加的团体的概念，是我们大家都能够信赖的军备监督制度的最后关键。
    因此我们必须以新的精力、新的创造性来寻求通向这样一种和平的道路，这种和平是建立在对军备的有效控制、经济进步和各国人民由他们所选择的政府来管理的自由上面的。只有这样我们才能运用上帝赋与我们的全部能力来丰富个人的生活，他们是我们终极的关切对象、我们的责任，我们的力量。
    为了完成这一盛举，一切地方的领袖大有可为，他们的精力可以得到充分的发挥，他们的雄心可以得到充分的酬报。
