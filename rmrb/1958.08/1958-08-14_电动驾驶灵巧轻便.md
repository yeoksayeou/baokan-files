　　Electric Driving, Agile and Lightweight

    The workers of the maintenance workshop of the Fifth Maintenance Depot of the Beijing Public Transportation Company have successfully modified the first bus capable of automatic clutch and gear shifting. A test run has been conducted between Qianmen and the Western Suburban Park, and the results are good.

    It was designed and modified by an automation research group composed of workshop workers, engineers, and cadres sent to lower levels, who worked hard for ten days on an Ikarus 307 bus produced in Hungary. When the driver drives this car, parks, starts, adjusts the speed, and changes gears, he no longer needs to pull with his hands and step with his feet. He only needs to press the electric button lightly with his finger. This greatly simplifies the complex operation of driving the car, reduces the driver's labor intensity, and strengthens the efficiency of controlling the vehicle. (Driving a bus in the city every day from morning to night requires the driver to pull the shift lever and step on the clutch about 1,500 times.)

　　电动驾驶灵巧轻便
    北京市公共汽车公司第五保养场保养车间工人们改装成功了第一辆能够自动离合、挂档的公共汽车。目前在前门到西郊公园间进行了一次试车，效果良好。
    它是由车间工人和工程师、下放干部联合组成的自动化研究小组，苦战十天，在匈牙利出产的依卡路斯307号车上，边设计边改装成功的。司机驾驶这种汽车、停车、开动和调整快慢、换牌档时，不必再用手拉脚踩，只要用手指轻轻一按电钮就行了，这就大大简化了驾驶汽车的复杂操作，减轻了司机的劳动强度，加强了控制车辆的效率。（按一辆公共汽车在市区行驶，每天从早到晚，司机要手拉变速杆及脚踩离合器一千五百次左右。）
