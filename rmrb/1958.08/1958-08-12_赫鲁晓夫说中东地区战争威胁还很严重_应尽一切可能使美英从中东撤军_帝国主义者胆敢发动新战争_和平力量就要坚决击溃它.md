Xinhua News Agency, ZHigulevsk, 11th - According to Tass, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said on the 10th that the Soviet Union, People's China, and all socialist countries have consistently pursued a policy of peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We will continue to adhere unswervingly to this policy in the future, and at the same time, we will take all measures to restrain the most arrogant Western aggressive blocs and prevent them from launching a new war. He said that if they disregard reason and forcibly impose a new war on the people of all countries, then we, together with all other peace-loving countries, will do everything possible to defeat the imperialist aggressors and establish world peace forever.
    Khrushchev participated in the complete completion ceremony of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station on the same day and spoke at the ceremony.
    The forces opposing colonialism have received the sympathy and support of the socialist camp countries. The era in which colonialists could suppress the colonial people at will has passed.
    When talking about the international situation, Khrushchev said that we should always remember that the achievements of the Soviet Union in communist construction are also the achievements of the entire powerful socialist camp. The achievements of the Soviet Union excite our friends, and we Soviet people are equally excited for the achievements of the great People's China and for the achievements of all fraternal countries building socialism. The unity and friendship of these countries are a force that no one can overcome at any time.
    Khrushchev said that the imperialists want to turn back the wheel of history and impose their will on the people of other countries. They incite the "Cold War" and pursue aggressive "positions of strength" policies and "brinkmanship" policies. The armed intervention of the United States in Lebanon and the armed intervention of the United Kingdom in Jordan are links in this policy. However, the era in which colonialists could suppress the colonial people at will has passed. They can no longer use the shackles of colonial slavery to bind the people of all countries, especially because the people of all countries have China, India, Indonesia and other countries living free lives without the rule of colonialists as examples.
    The forces fighting against colonialism have received the sympathy and support of the Soviet Union, China, and the countries of the socialist camp. Socialist countries are a powerful force, and their existence itself is a factor that can restrain the aggressive ambitions of the colonialists.
    Khrushchev said that the ruling groups of the United States and Britain rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit conference to discuss the situation created in the Near and Middle East due to US-British intervention. They used the negotiations of the conference to send more troops to Lebanon and Jordan. The angry protests of world public opinion condemning imperialist aggression and the determination of all peace-loving countries to stop aggression forced the planners of military intervention to abandon their original plan to launch an offensive against the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries.
    However, the threat of war in this region of the world is still very serious, and we are doing everything possible to work with the peace-loving people of all countries to stop military intervention and withdraw US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The people of the Arab East should fully exercise their sovereignty - arrange their lives according to their own wishes without any foreign interference.
    The Soviet Union now has a power generation capacity that is one hundred times that of before the revolution. The high-speed development of Soviet industry and agriculture reflects the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.
    In his speech, Khrushchev expressed warm congratulations to the construction personnel of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. He said that this world's largest hydropower station built on the Volga River has great economic and political significance, and is an important link in our people's realization of the national electrification plan in accordance with the immortal legacy of the great Lenin.
    Khrushchev said that in the past, people thought that building a power station with a power generation capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts in a period of ten to fifteen years was an impossible dream, but now we have increased our power generation capacity by five million kilowatts in one year. Today, there are already five huge hydropower stations generating electricity on the Volga River. Compared with pre-revolutionary Russia, the Soviet Union's current power generation has increased to one hundred times that of that time. In 1928, our country's electricity production lagged behind the United States, Britain, Germany, Canada, Japan, France, Italy, and Norway. Now, the Soviet Union's electricity production ranks first in Europe and second in the world. Khrushchev said that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the Soviet Union's electricity generation will increase by 150 billion kilowatt-hours.
    Khrushchev said that we now have the material conditions to realize Lenin's idea of national electrification. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU has instructed the State Planning Commission and relevant agencies to formulate a plan for the overall national electrification to realize Lenin's great ideal. In this way, a strong foundation will be laid for the vigorous development of national productivity. Relying on this modern foundation, the construction of a communist society will proceed more smoothly.
    Khrushchev said that Soviet industry and agriculture, relying on electricity, will be able to develop at a speed that no capitalist country has ever experienced in its most developed period. He said that this embodies the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.
    When talking about the results of industrial and agricultural production in the first half of 1958, Khrushchev pointed out that these results show that the Soviet Union is confidently advancing along the road of economic prosperity. He said that the Soviet people are successfully realizing the main economic task - catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest possible period of time in history.
    Khrushchev said that our agricultural situation is also very good, and collective farms and state farms in almost all regions can achieve a good harvest of grain and other crops. This year, the state will receive more grain than in the unprecedentedly good harvest of 1956. The production of milk, meat, butter and other livestock products is constantly growing.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union will give priority to the construction of thermal power plants because they are cheaper to build and take less time.
    In his speech, Khrushchev talked in detail about the development prospects of Soviet power station construction. He said that in recent years, the Soviet Union will give priority to the construction of thermal power plants. These power plants will use cheap coal, natural gas, and oil.
    Khrushchev pointed out that the electricity generated by hydropower stations is the cheapest. However, we should also see certain factors that make us should consider how to use the funds for developing power technology more correctly and rationally. Under the current conditions, the most important issue is to win time, shorten construction time and obtain more electricity at a lower cost. In this regard, from a national point of view, it is appropriate to consciously increase the price of each kilowatt-hour slightly in order to win time and maximize the growth of electricity production in a short period of time. Khrushchev cited data to show that the construction cost of thermal power plants is relatively cheaper, and the time required to build thermal power plants is also shorter. He said that with the time and funds used to build a hydropower station with a power generation capacity of one million kilowatts, we can build two or three thermal power plants with the same power generation capacity.
    Khrushchev said that in the peaceful competition with capitalist countries, we should strive to win ten to fifteen years of time. When we win this time and greatly develop our industry, we can allocate the necessary funds to build hydropower stations. The construction of several hydropower stations will be delayed in time, but later, when we have solved the urgent task of accelerating the development of power through the construction of thermal power plants, it will be possible to fully utilize water resources to realize national electrification.

### 赫鲁晓夫说中东地区战争威胁还很严重  应尽一切可能使美英从中东撤军　帝国主义者胆敢发动新战争　和平力量就要坚决击溃它

    赫鲁晓夫说中东地区战争威胁还很严重
    应尽一切可能使美英从中东撤军
　　帝国主义者胆敢发动新战争　和平力量就要坚决击溃它
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社日古列夫斯克讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫10日说，苏联、人民中国以及各个社会主义国家始终一贯地执行和平政策、社会制度不同的国家和平共处的政策。我们今后仍将坚持不渝地执行这种政策，同时也将采取一切措施来约束最狂妄的西方侵略集团，阻止他们发动新战争。他说，如果他们漠视理智而硬把新战争强加在各国人民头上，那么，我们将同一切其他爱好和平的国家一道尽一切努力击溃帝国主义侵略者，并且永远地确立世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫在当天参加了世界上规模最大的古比雪夫水电站全部落成典礼，并且在典礼上讲了话。
    反对殖民主义的力量得到社会主义阵营各国的同情和支持。殖民主义者能够为所欲为地镇压殖民地人民的时代已经过去了。
    在谈到国际形势的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，我们应当经常记住，苏联在共产主义建设中的成就也是整个强大的社会主义阵营的成就。苏联的成就使我们的朋友兴奋，而我们苏联人也同样为伟大的人民中国的成就，为所有建设社会主义的兄弟国家的成就而感到衷心的兴奋。我们这些国家的团结和友谊是任何人、在任何时候都战胜不了的力量。
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义者想倒转历史的车轮，把自己的意志强加在其他国家人民的身上。他们煽动“冷战”，执行侵略性的“实力地位”政策、“战争边缘”政策。美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉和英国对约旦的武装干涉就是这种政策的环节之一。但是，殖民主义者能够为所欲为地镇压殖民地人民的时代已经过去了。他们再也不能用殖民主义奴役的枷锁束缚各国人民了，这特别是因为各国人民有中国、印度、印度尼西亚和其他国家过着不受殖民主义者统治的自由生活作为榜样。
    为反对殖民主义而斗争的力量得到苏联、中国、社会主义阵营各国的同情和支持。社会主义国家是一支强大的力量，它们的存在本身就是能约束殖民主义者的侵略野心的因素。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美英两国统治集团拒绝了苏联提出的召开政府首脑会议来讨论由于美英干涉而在中近东所造成的局势的建议。他们利用召开会议的谈判来向黎巴嫩和约旦增派军队。世界公众谴责帝国主义侵略的愤怒抗议、各爱好和平国家制止侵略的决心迫使军事干涉的策划者放弃了他们最初想对伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家发动进攻的计划。
    但是，世界这个地区的战争威胁还很严重，我们正在尽一切可能同各国爱好和平人民一道争取停止军事干涉，使美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。阿拉伯东方人民应当充分行使自己的主权——按照自己的意愿来安排自己的生活，而不受任何外来干涉。
    苏联现在发电量为革命前一百倍。苏联工农业这种高速度发展，体现了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中对古比雪夫水电站的建筑人员表示了热烈的祝贺。他说，伏尔加河上建成的这个世界上规模最大的水力发电站在经济上和政治上具有重大的意义，是我国人民按照伟大列宁的不朽遗训实现国家电气化计划方面的重要环节。
    赫鲁晓夫说，从前，人们认为要在十—十五年时期内建成发电能力为一百五十万瓩的发电站是一种不能实现的梦想，而现在我们在一年的时间内就增加了五百万瓩的发电能力。今天在伏尔加河上已经有五个巨大的水电站在发电。和革命前的俄国相比，苏联现在的发电量增加到当时的一百倍。1928年，我国的电力生产落后于美国、英国、德国、加拿大、日本、法国、意大利和挪威。现在，苏联的电力生产占欧洲第一位和世界第二位。赫鲁晓夫说，在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间，苏联的发电量将增加一千五百亿度。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在我们具有物质条件来实现列宁关于全国电气化的思想。苏共中央主席团已经责成国家计划委员会和有关的机构拟定国家全盘电气化的计划，以实现列宁的伟大理想。这样，就将为大力发展全国生产力奠定强大的基础。依靠这个现代化的基础，共产主义社会的建设将更加顺利地进行。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的工业和农业依靠电力将能以任何一个资本主义国家在它们最发达的时期都从来没有过的速度向前发展。他说，这里体现了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比的优越性。
    在谈到1958年上半年工农业生产的结果时，赫鲁晓夫指出，这些结果表明，苏联正满怀信心地沿着经济繁荣的道路前进。他说，苏联人民正在顺利地实现主要的经济任务——在历史上最短的时期内在按人口平均的产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的农业状况也很好，几乎各地的集体农庄和国营农场的谷物和其他农作物都能丰收。今年国家得到的粮食将比空前丰收的1956年还要多。牛奶、肉类、黄油和其他畜产品的生产正在不断增长。
    在最近一些年内，苏联将优先建设火力发电站，因为造价便宜，需时也短。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中详细谈到了苏联发电站建设的发展前景。他说，在最近一些年内，苏联将优先建设火力发电站。这些发电站将使用便宜的煤、天然瓦斯和石油。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，水电站发出的电力是最便宜的。但是，我们还应该看到某些因素，这些因素使得我们应该考虑如何更加正确、更加合理地利用发展动力技术的资金问题。在当前条件下，最主要的问题是要赢得时间，缩短建筑时间和以较少的代价获得更多的电力。在这方面，从全国观点来看，有意识地稍微提高一些每一度电的价格，以便赢得时间和在短时期内使电力生产获得最大限度的增长，这是适宜的。赫鲁晓夫引用资料，说明火力发电站的建筑费用比较便宜，而建造火电站所需要的时间也要少些。他说，我们用建设一个发电能力为一百万瓩的水电站的时间和资金，可以建造两个或者三个有同样发电能力的火力发电站。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在同资本主义国家的和平竞赛中我们应当争取赢得十年到十五年的时间。当我们赢得这个时间并大大地发展了我国的工业的时候，我们就可以拨出必要的资金去建设水电站。若干水电站的建设在时间上将往后拖一拖，但是以后当我们由于火电站的建设解决了加速发展动力的迫切任务时，就有可能充分利用水力资源来实现国家电气化。
