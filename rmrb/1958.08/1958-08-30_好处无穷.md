Title: Boundless Benefits

　　The work-study program at Changge County Middle School was praised by Chairman Mao, and this is not without reason.

　　Let's take a look at the achievements of Changge No. 3 Middle School, the earliest and best work-study school in Changge County! When their graduating students took the high school entrance exams, the admission rate was the highest in the entire district. Among the more than 200 students who participated in labor, 82 were named labor models in just two months; 59 became secretaries of the Communist Youth League branch and teachers in privately run schools, and two became directors of agricultural cooperatives.

　　What does this fact illustrate? It shows that combining education with productive labor has boundless benefits! Through the work-study program, the students of Changge Middle School strengthened their class consciousness, improved their academic level, learned labor skills, and became healthier. Moreover, from the perspective of school education, the education system has been reformed, the content of education has become more practical, and the teachers' knowledge has also been enriched. In this way, the students cultivated by the school are worthy of what Chairman Mao said: laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

　　However, there are always a small number of people who adopt an antagonistic attitude towards new things. They always believe that only the bourgeois education system, methods, and content are orthodox. They stubbornly insist that combining education with productive labor will reduce the quality of teaching. They also say that the school is chaotic and doesn't look like a school at all! Some of them even say that the difference between mental and physical labor cannot be eliminated for a long period of time. It is a waste for the country and a loss for the individual to have students not pursue "advanced studies" but instead become laborers. Of course, if they do not implement work-study programs, do not combine education with productive labor, and are unwilling to let the working people learn culture and engage in science and technology, still regarding studying as superior or only allowing workers and peasants to work and farm, then the difference between mental and physical labor will never be eliminated in ten thousand years, which would make them gloat that their "unfortunate prediction" came true. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the policy of work-study programs and combining education with productive labor, and use facts to educate them.

　　Facts are ruthless. Since the policy of combining education with productive labor was put forward, how long has it been before one piece of good news after another came in quick succession? Students are both capable in writing and martial arts, both workers and farmers, and both red and expert. In science, hundreds of cutting-edge technologies have been broken through; in academics, thousands of good suggestions have been put forward; in factories, tens of thousands of products have been manufactured; on farms, students are full of energy! The new socialist regular education system is about to take shape, and the old capitalist regular education system has begun to be buried. Are these facts not enough to sweep away the garbage in the minds of some trend-watching people?

　　好处无穷
　　李梓
    长葛县中学的勤工俭学，曾经受到毛主席的表扬，这不是没有道理的。
    让我们看看，长葛县勤工俭学搞得最早最好的长葛三中的成绩吧！他们毕业班的学生在考高中的时候，录取比例为全专区第一；参加劳动的二百多个学生，仅仅两个月，就有八十二人当了劳动模范；五十九人当了团支部书记和民办学校的老师，两个人当了农业社的社长。
    这个事实说明什么呢？事实说明，教育结合生产劳动好处无穷！长葛中学的学生，通过勤工俭学，阶级觉悟加强了；学业水平提高了；劳动本事学会了；身体也健康了。不仅如此，从学校教育来说，教育制度革新了；教育内容切实了；老师本身的学问也丰富了。这样，学校培养出来的学生，才配得上毛主席所说的：有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    可是，总有那么一小部分人要对新事物采取对抗的态度。他们总是认为只有资产阶级的一套教育制度、教育方法、教育内容才是正规的。他们硬说教育结合生产劳动会降低教学质量。他们又说学校里乱哄哄的，简直不像个学校了！他们之中有些人却说，脑力劳动同体力劳动的差别在很长的时期内不可能消灭。要学生不去“深造”，而去作什么劳动者，对国家是个浪费，对本人是个吃亏的事。当然，像他们一样，不去实行勤工俭学，不使教育和生产劳动相结合，也不愿意让劳动人民学文化搞科学技术，仍旧以读书为高或只准工农作工种田，那就一万年也不能消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，那就会让他们窃喜“不幸而言中”。因此，我们要坚决贯彻勤工俭学，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，用事实来教育他们。
    事实是无情的，教育结合生产劳动的方针提出以后，曾几何时，胜利的喜报一个接连一个。学生们能文能武、亦工亦农、又红又专。在科学上，成百项尖端技术被突破；在学术上，成千条好意见被提出；在工厂里，成万件产品被制出；在农场上，学生们干劲冲天！新的社会主义的正规教育制度即将形成，旧的资本主义的正规教育制度已经开始入土。这些事实，难道还不足以扫清某些观潮派头脑里的垃圾吗？
