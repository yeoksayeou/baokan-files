The Policies of the Rockefeller Dynasty
By A. Leonídov
(Soviet Union)

IV

The current stance of the Rockefeller financial group in international policy is determined by the following three principles:

	1. To open up the market of death for the billions of dollars invested in the military industry.
	2. To continue pursuing the policy of seizing all the Middle East's oil and subjugating the already rising Arab world ("Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine").
	3. To prevent the spread of socialist ideology, which threatens the hegemony of the billionaires, in the West and throughout the world (McCarthyism).

Rockefellerism is the culmination of all modern "isms" of American imperialism. The above three principles of Rockefellerism can constitute a program of "brinkmanship." This policy has become the dominant theme and the obsession of the entire Rockefeller financial group. They can find no other way to start their massive profit machine and expand their empire. Billions of capital are shouting, "Death!", and billionaires are winding up the State Department.

Now, let me mention a few things that have happened in recent months and days. As everyone knows, in December 1957, the so-called "Gaither Committee," appointed by Eisenhower to address defense issues, reported to the President in a secret report that if the United States did not increase its annual military spending by eight billion dollars, it would face an "irreparable disaster." In fact, the leader of the "Gaither Committee" was former Deputy Secretary of Defense Foster, who is also the Vice President of the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, and the co-owner of the company is Laurence Rockefeller. The report's drafters also included: former Secretary of Defense and current Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Lovett, and former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany and current Chairman of Rockefeller's "Manhattan Chase Bank," McCloy, among others.

In January 1958, a new report on national security was published. This report insisted on recommending to the government that it expand military spending by thirty billion dollars over the next four years, so that the entire American military machine is fully prepared for war, in order to carry out "total war" and "limited war." The main drafter of the new report was Nelson Rockefeller, Eisenhower's former special assistant for psychological strategy. His brother, Laurence Rockefeller, was also among the drafters.

In April, the authoritative New York magazine "Foreign Affairs," which is considered the mouthpiece of the State Department, published an article advocating for the further establishment of American rocket bases abroad. The author of the article was Kissinger, the head of the Special Studies Project of the Rockefeller Foundation.

This spring, Eisenhower was constantly subjected to pressure aimed at hindering the convening of a summit meeting. The President was also forced to accept the more irreconcilable "Open Skies" proposal on aerial surveillance. They intended to use this proposal to undermine agreements on stopping the Cold War. One of the authors of the proposal was Nelson Rockefeller.

In June, the West launched a frantic campaign, using the Hungarian court's verdict against the Imre Nagy group as an excuse. The most active organizer of this campaign was the New York "Crusade for Freedom" committee, which controls the "Radio Free Europe" radio station. The leader of the committee was Eugene Holman, manager of the New Jersey Standard Oil Company.

In July, American troops landed in Lebanon, and the United States extended its fist to the entire Arab East. Thus, the danger of a world conflict arose. Even the American press wrote that the armed intervention in the Middle East was carried out according to the instructions of the Rockefeller financial group, which and its accomplices have invested $1.5 billion in oil fields in the region and intended to make even greater fortunes at the expense of the interests of Arab countries.

According to calculations by British and American experts, in a few years, the annual oil production in the Middle East will begin to reach 400 million tons. Although the American share of this output is only half, and the net profit per ton of oil is calculated at thirteen dollars, the Rockefeller financial group can extract more than $2.5 billion in profits from the Middle East each year. From the point of view of financial oligarchs, for such a profit, it is worth intervening in Lebanon and provoking 80 million Arabs; it is even worth pushing further towards the abyss on the edge of World War III.

It is no secret to anyone in the United States who the extreme supporters of the "brinkmanship" policy are around the White House. Usually, the names that come to mind first are: the former President of the Rockefeller Foundation and U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles; this Dulles's brother, the Rockefeller financial group's former lawyer, and head of the U.S. intelligence agency, Allen Dulles; a person very close to the Rockefeller financial group, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Radford; and Nelson Rockefeller, who recently served alongside the President. The last one is John Rockefeller III, the head of this dynasty, who is considered to be the mastermind of American aggression in Asia.

This is the master of the number one financial empire. Belonging to the same group of advocates are other reactionary American politicians, military personnel, monopoly capitalists and their agents. However, the main decision-makers are in the offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York.

Recent events are vivid examples of Rockefeller's policies in action. The entire machinery of the Rockefeller financial empire is exposed. The tens of billions of dollars that the Rockefeller financial group has invested in oil have prompted the United States to embark on a "limited war" adventure against the Arabs in the Middle East. The tens of billions of dollars they invested in the arms industry are dragging the country into "total war." Those American politicians who are completely subordinate to the oil monopoly capital have made decisions to interfere in places thousands of kilometers away from the United States, and completely disregard the rights of the people of all countries, wise opinions, the warnings of world opinion, and the concerns of the American people. American diplomats described the intervention as defending the national interests of the United States.

The whole machine has started up. A few years ago, the New York "Compass Daily" wrote, referring to this machine:

	"The policy of the State Department is produced in the offices of the Standard Oil Company. From here, the policy is transferred to the Department of Defense, where it is approved by the leaders of the Army and Navy. When this policy is sent to the State Department, it becomes the policy of the government..."

From the oil and atomic business to provoking new military adventures, this is the law of motion of the Rockefeller financial group's billions of dollars. However, in today's world, there is another, more powerful law of motion, which is the law of the will of the people of all countries to desire peace. It can turn the policies of the Rockefeller dynasty into a scrap of paper. (To be concluded)

    洛克菲勒王朝的政策
    苏联　阿·列昂尼道夫
    四
    目前洛克菲勒财团在国际政策方面所持的立场，是由下面三个原则决定的：
    1．为投入军事工业的数十亿美元而开放死亡市场。
    2．继续奉行争夺整个中东石油的政策，使已经奋起的阿拉伯世界屈服（“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”）。
    3．防止威胁着亿万富翁们的霸权的社会主义思想在西方和全世界的传播（麦卡锡主义）。
    洛克菲勒主义是集美帝国主义现代的一切“主义”的大成。上述洛克菲勒主义的三个原则，可以构成“战争边缘”政策的纲领。这个政策已成为整个洛克菲勒财团的主导旋律和疯狂思想。他们找不到另外的道路来开动自己的巨大的利润机器和扩大自己的帝国。亿万资本在叫喊着：“死亡！”，亿万富翁们在拨动国务院的发条。
    现在提一下最近几个月和最近一些日子发生的几件事。众所周知，1957年12月，艾森豪威尔任命的所谓关于国防问题的“盖瑟委员会”在秘密报告中向总统报告说：如果美国不增加八十亿美元的年度军事开支，则将面临“不可挽救的灾难”。实际上“盖瑟委员会”的领导人，就是前国防部副部长福斯特，此人就是奥林·麦奇逊化学康采恩的副董事，而公司的共同所有人就是劳伦斯·洛克菲勒。报告的起草人还有：前国防部长、现洛克菲勒基金会财政委员会主席罗维特，前美国驻德高级专员、现洛克菲勒的“曼哈顿大通银行”董事长麦克洛埃等人。
    1958年1月，发表了关于国家安全的一份新的报告。这份报告坚持向政府建议，在最近四年中扩大军事开支三百亿美元，使美国军事机器全部作好战争准备，以便进行“总体战争”和“有限战争”。新报告的主要起草人是艾森豪威尔前任心理战略专门助理纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。在起草人当中还有他的兄弟劳伦斯·洛克菲勒。
    4月间，被认为是国务院喉舌的、权威的纽约杂志“外交季刊”发表了一篇文章，主张进一步在外国建立美国火箭基地。文章的作者就是洛克菲勒基金会特别研究组的负责人基辛格。
    今年春天艾森豪威尔不断受到旨在阻碍召开最高级会议的压力。总统又被迫接受了关于空中监察问题的更加不可调和的“开方天空”方案。他们打算靠这个方案破坏关于制止冷战的协议。方案的作者之一，就是纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。
    6月间，西方以匈牙利法庭判决伊姆雷·纳吉集团作借口，发起了一个疯狂的运动。这次运动的最积极的组织者，就是掌握“自由欧洲”电台的纽约“自由十字军”委员会。该委员会的领导人，就是新泽西美孚油公司经理尤金·赫尔曼。
    7月间，美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆，美国把拳头伸向整个阿拉伯东方。于是发生了世界冲突的危险。甚至美国报刊都写道，对中东的武装干涉是遵照洛克菲勒财团的指令行动的，洛克菲勒财团及其同伙在这个地区的油田投下了十五亿美元的资本，他们打算靠牺牲阿拉伯国家的利益发更大的财。
    据英美专家们计算，再过几年以后，中东的石油年产量将开始达到四亿吨。在这个产量中，美国所占的份额虽然只有一半，同时每吨石油所得的纯利按十三美元计，洛克菲勒财团每年就可以从中东榨取到二十五亿美元以上的利润。从财政寡头的观点出发，为了这样一笔利润，是值得对黎巴嫩进行干涉，向八千万阿拉伯人挑衅的；甚至值得向那处于第三次世界大战深渊边缘的悬崖再推进一步。
    在白宫周围的一批“战争边缘”政策的极端拥护者是些什么人，这在美国对于任何人说来都不是秘密了。通常首先可以举出这样一些人的名字：洛克菲勒基金会的前任主席、美国国务卿约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯；这个杜勒斯的兄弟、洛克菲勒财团的过去的律师、美国特务机关的头子艾伦·杜勒斯；一个非常接近洛克菲勒财团的人、前参谋长联席会议主席、海军上将雷德福；不久以前在总统身边服务的纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。最后一个是约翰·洛克菲勒第三，他是现在这个王朝的头子，他被认为是美国侵略亚洲政策的主使人。
    这是第一号金融帝国的主宰者。属于这同一个倡导者集团的还有另外一些反动的美国政客、军人、垄断资本家及其代理人。但是，主要的决策人是在纽约洛克菲勒广场门牌三十号的办公室里。
    近来的事件，是洛克菲勒政策在行动中的鲜明例证。洛克菲勒金融帝国机器的全部发条都显露出来了。洛克菲勒财团投在石油方面的数十亿美元，促使美国在中东对阿拉伯人进行“有限战争”的冒险。他们投在军火工业上的数十亿美元，把国家拖下水，走向“总体战争”。美国的那些完全附属于石油垄断资本的政客们，采取了对远离美国数千公里地方进行干涉的决定，而丝毫也不理睬各国人民的权利、明智的意见、世界舆论的警告以及美国人民的担心。美国的外交家把干涉说成是保卫美国的国家利益。
    整个机器都开动起来了。几年前，纽约的“指南针日报”在提到这个机器时写道：
    “国务院的政策是在美孚油公司的办事处里产生的。这个政策从这里转到国防部，在那里由陆军和海军的领导人予以批准。当这个政策送到国务院时，便成了政府的政策……。”
    从石油和原子生意到挑起新的军事冒险，这就是洛克菲勒财团亿万美元的运动规律。但是，在今天的世界上还有另外一个更强大的运动规律，这就是各国人民渴望和平的意志的规律。它可以把洛克菲勒王朝的政策化成一纸空文。　（续完）
