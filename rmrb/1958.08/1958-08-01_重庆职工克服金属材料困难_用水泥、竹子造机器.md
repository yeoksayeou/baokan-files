    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th - Chongqing's factory and mine workers are using substitutes such as cement, bamboo, and wood to replace some metal materials in the manufacturing of machines, overcoming the widespread difficulties currently experienced with metal material shortages.
    Many workers in the machinery, iron and steel, construction, and transportation sectors have done an excellent job in this area. Workers at the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, after six days of hard work, used cement instead of cast iron for the base and wall panels, and successfully produced a four-meter gantry planer. Each of these planers can save the state 6,000 kilograms of pig iron, and the manufacturing cost can be reduced by 62%. This initiative has aroused great interest among Chongqing's machinery manufacturing workers, who generally believe that using cement instead of steel to manufacture certain parts of machine tools is of great benefit in solving the current difficulties with a shortage of large machine tools. According to the factory's experiments, cement can be used as a machine base for large equipment that is fixed and does not vibrate much. The Chongqing Wangjiang Machine Factory is now manufacturing a twenty-two-meter long cement base combined machine tool.
    The Chongqing General Machinery Factory uses bamboo to weave various low-pressure water pipes and air ducts of different sizes, and then coats them with a layer of chemical coating. When used, they are the same as steel air ducts and cast iron pipes. The first batch of products has now supported the construction of the Liangfengya Tunnel and the Lou Shan Pass Tunnel of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway.
    Other examples include machinery factories using ceramic blades instead of alloy steel blades, and auto repair shops using bamboo strips instead of steel leaf springs to manufacture automobile parts, which not only saves metal materials, but also has excellent performance.

    重庆职工克服金属材料困难
    用水泥、竹子造机器
    据新华社重庆30日电　重庆许多厂矿职工用水泥、竹子、木料等代用品来代替部分金属材料制造机器，克服目前金属材料普遍感到不足的困难。
    机械、钢铁、建筑和运输部门的许多职工，在这方面做得很出色。重庆空气压缩机厂的职工苦战六天，用水泥代替铸铁作座子和墙板，制成了一台四公尺的龙门刨床。这种刨床每台可为国家节约六千公斤生铁，制造成本可以降低62％。这个创举引起重庆机械制造工人极大的兴趣，普遍认为用水泥代替钢铁制造机床上的某些部件，对解决目前大型机床不足的困难有很大好处。根据这个厂的试验，凡是固定的、不大震动的大型设备，都可以用水泥作机座。现在重庆望江机器厂正在制造二十二公尺长的水泥机座组合机床。
    重庆通用机器厂用竹料编成各种大小不同的低压水管、风管，然后涂上一层化学涂料，使用起来同钢做的风管和铸铁管一样。现在第一批产品已支援了川黔铁路凉风垭大隧道和娄山关隧道的建设。
    其他如机械厂以瓷质刀片代替合金钢刀，汽车修配厂以竹片代替钢板弹簧制造汽车的部件等，不但节约了金属材料，而且性能很好。
