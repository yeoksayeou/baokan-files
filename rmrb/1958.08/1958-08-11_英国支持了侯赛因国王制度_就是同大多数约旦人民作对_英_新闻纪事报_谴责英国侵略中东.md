Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to TASS, London: An article by Richard Beeston, the Middle East correspondent of the British "News Chronicle," published on the 9th, condemned Britain's acts of aggression, saying that Britain is now supporting the regime of King Hussein, who is hostile to the Jordanian people.

He wrote, "In doing so, we are not only violating the nationalist aspirations of the Arab people, but also the wishes of the vast majority of the Jordanian people. The Jordanian people will get rid of Hussein's rule whenever possible in the future." The reporter continued, "What Hussein fears is not external forces, but internal forces within Jordan, that is, he fears his own people."

The British "Daily Worker" pointed out in an editorial on the 9th that Britain and the United States are still sending troops to Jordan and Lebanon. The "Daily Worker" called on British workers to demand that the government change its policy and withdraw British troops from Jordan.

　　英国支持了侯赛因国王制度
　　就是同大多数约旦人民作对
　　英“新闻纪事报”谴责英国侵略中东
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国“新闻纪事报”9日发表的该报驻中东记者理查德·比斯顿的一篇文章谴责英国的侵略行动说，英国现在所支持的是敌视约旦人民的侯赛因国王的制度。
    他写道，“我们这样做不仅违反了阿拉伯人民的民族主义意向，而且也违反了绝大多数约旦人民的愿望。约旦人民只要将来有可能，就会摆脱侯赛因的统治。”记者继续写道，“侯赛因所害怕的不是外来力量，而是约旦的内部力量，也就是害怕他本国的人民。”
    英国“工人日报”9日在社论中指出，英国和美国还在往约旦和黎巴嫩增派军队。“工人日报”号召英国工人要求政府改变政策，把英国军队撤出约旦。
