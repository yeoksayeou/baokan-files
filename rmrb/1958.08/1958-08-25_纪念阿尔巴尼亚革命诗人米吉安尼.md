　　In Memory of Albanian Revolutionary Poet Migjeni
　　Ge Baoquan

　　August 26th of this year marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Migjeni, an outstanding revolutionary poet of Albania in the 1930s. Migjeni was a revolutionary singer of the new Albania, the banner of Albania's fighting poetry. Although his creative life was only a few short years, his poems full of revolutionary passion had a tremendous impact on the people of Albania and the new generation of youth; his glorious name will forever occupy an important place in the history of Albanian poetry and literature. His poems, especially the famous poem "We are the Children of the New Era," are almost recited by every young Albanian. Today, Migjeni's name has transcended the borders of Albania and is loved by the Chinese people, and his immortal works are also recited by a wide range of Chinese readers.

　　Migjeni's life and creative path are closely linked to the Albanian people's struggle for national liberation and revolutionary struggle. Due to the national liberation movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Albanian people were finally liberated from nearly five centuries of slavery and shackles under the Turks, but soon after, the Albanian people were subjected to the oppression of their own feudal lords and bourgeoisie, who turned Albania back into a semi-colony of foreign imperialists. With the development of the new situation, in the 1920s and 1930s, new representatives of revolutionary literature appeared on the Albanian literary scene, and in poetry, this was the revolutionary poet Migjeni!

　　Migjeni's original name was Millosh Gjergj Nikolla, and when he later wrote, he used the pen name Migjeni, which was formed by the first syllable of these three words. He was born on October 13, 1911, the eve of the Albanian people's liberation from Turkish slavery, in the slum area of ​​Shkodër, northern Albania, so from childhood he deeply knew the bitterness and suffering of the poor working people. He studied at the local elementary school, and when he was thirteen years old (1924), an armed uprising against the dictatorship of Ahmed Zogu's feudal lords and landlord groups broke out in Albania. At the end of 1924, Zogu regained power and implemented a reign of terror throughout the country. All of this left a deep mark on Migjeni's young mind.

　　With the successive deaths of his parents, Migjeni was sent to a seminary in Yugoslavia to study, but eight years of monastic life failed to tame this young rebellious soul. On the contrary, in many poems and short stories he later wrote, he satirized the hypocrisy and benevolence of the church and priests. In 1932, Migjeni returned to Albania, immediately threw himself into the struggle against Zogu, and expressed the revolutionary passion of the progressive youth and the desire for freedom and liberation through his earliest poems, such as "We are the Children of the New Era," "Song of Awakening," and "Song of Youth." He used such verses to ignite the excited hearts of every young person and encourage them to engage in revolutionary struggle:

　　“Youths, sing your songs, cheer up!…………
　　The song belongs to us, just as the sun shines in the sky!
　　Sing, youths! Sing happy songs!
　　Cheer up! Cheer up! You are the true masters of the world!"
                                      (“Song of Youth”)

　　“We are the children of the new era!
　　Our hearts are burning with pride,
　　We will plunge into the desperate battle,
　　And finally win the victory in the struggle!”
        (“We are the Children of the New Era”)

　　In Albania at that time, it was difficult for Migjeni to support himself by writing alone, let alone write poems full of revolutionary passion, so he went to work as a teacher in the countryside near Shkodër. This gave him the opportunity to understand more deeply the miserable lives of Albanian peasants, and all the contradictions of the bourgeoisie and the feudal system became more clearly presented before his eyes. At this time, Migjeni approached the Albanian communist group and unswervingly chose his place in the social revolutionary struggle. Needless to say, this caused the ruling class to persecute and monitor him in every possible way. He was finally forced to move to a remote mountain village called Puka to continue working as a village teacher, where he lived until he went to Italy for medical treatment.

　　Migjeni's creative life was short, but in the short four productive years of 1934-1938, he wrote his most mature realistic poetry and prose works. In poetry, he wrote the series of poems "Song of Poverty" after "Song of Awakening"; in prose, he wrote outstanding short stories such as "Forbidden Fruit" (1935), "Cherry" (1936), "The Legend of Corn" (1936), "God will Give!" (1936), and "Harvest" (1938). In these works, Migjeni had abandoned the romantic metaphors he used to use in the past, and instead used realistic techniques to depict the grim reality of social life, and was the first to write the image of the working class into Albanian literary works. His works not only developed the fighting tradition in Albanian poetry, but also broke through the atmosphere of bourgeois artistic decadence and formalism that permeated the literary and art circles at that time, surpassing all poets and writers at that time and creating truly revolutionary struggle works. Needless to say, the existence of the great Soviet Union and socialist realism literary works also encouraged Migjeni's confidence. We know that Gorky's novel "Mother" and Mayakovsky's poems had a great influence on Migjeni.

　　In 1936, Migjeni's only collection of poems, "Poems of Freedom," was published. This collection contains more than forty poems he wrote, such as "Song of Revival," "Song of Poverty," "Song of Youth," and "Song of Old Age." After the publication of this collection of poems, it was immediately confiscated by the censorship authorities of the Zogu government, and only a few copies were preserved. The poems in it were spread throughout the country in the form of handwritten copies, and no precautions could cut off the connection between the poet and the broad masses of readers. This is as the famous Albanian writer and poet Aleks Çaçi said: "Migjeni's 'Poems of Freedom' educated our entire young generation."

　　Migjeni's later life was very difficult. Due to suffering from lung disease, he had to move to Turin, Italy, for treatment. He finally died in a sanatorium there on August 26, 1938, at the age of twenty-seven, which was the most vigorous period of his poetry creation. According to the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, his remains were transported back from Italy in early spring last year and a grand funeral was held in Shkodër, the poet's birthplace, on February 5.

　　It is no accident that Migjeni is loved by the Albanian people today. He always stood on the side of the people, his thoughts and feelings were inextricably linked with the working people, and he used his fighting poems to serve the revolution. Because of this, his name and image will always live in the hearts of the Albanian people. Although his creative life was short, his only immortal collection of poems has become not only a precious legacy of the Albanian people, but also a precious legacy of the world's cultural treasury.

　　纪念阿尔巴尼亚革命诗人米吉安尼
　　戈宝权
    今年的8月26日，是阿尔巴尼亚二十世纪三十年代杰出的革命诗人米吉安尼逝世的二十周年。米吉安尼是阿尔巴尼亚新时代的革命歌手，是阿尔巴尼亚战斗的诗歌的旗帜。他的创作生活虽然只是短短的几年，但是他的充满革命激情的诗歌，对于阿尔巴尼亚的人民和新的一代的青年，曾经发生过巨大的影响；他的光辉的名字，也永远在阿尔巴尼亚的诗歌和文学的发展史上占着重要的位置。他的诗歌作品，尤其是“我们是新时代的儿女”这首著名的诗，差不多每一个阿尔巴尼亚的青年人都能背诵。在今天，米吉安尼的名字已经超越出了阿尔巴尼亚的国境，为我们中国人民所敬爱，他的不朽的作品也为中国广大的读者所诵读。
    米吉安尼的生活和创作的道路，和阿尔巴尼亚人民争取民族解放和进行革命斗争的道路是紧密地相联系着的。由于十九世纪和二十世纪初叶的民族解放运动，终于使得阿尔巴尼亚人民从土耳其人将近五个世纪的奴役和枷锁之下获得解放，但是接着不久，阿尔巴尼亚人民又遭受到本国的封建主和资产阶级的压迫，这些人使得阿尔巴尼亚重新变成了外国帝国主义者的半殖民地。随着新的情况的发展，在二十世纪的二十年代和三十年代，在阿尔巴尼亚的文坛上就出现了新的革命文学的代表者，在诗歌方面这就是革命诗人米吉安尼！
    米吉安尼的原名是米洛什·吉尔治·尼古拉，当他后来写作时，他就用这三个字的第一个音节拼成的米吉安尼这个笔名。他在1911年10月13日，也就是阿尔巴尼亚人民从土耳其人的奴役之下获得解放的前夜，诞生在阿尔巴尼亚北部斯库台城的贫民住区里，因此他从童年时起就深知道贫穷的劳动人民的辛酸与苦痛的生活。他在当地的小学里读过书，当他十三岁时（1924年），在阿尔巴尼亚爆发了反对阿赫默德·索古封建主与地主集团独裁的武装起义，1924年底索古又重新攫夺了政权，并在全国实行了恐怖统治，这一切都在米吉安尼的年幼的心灵上盖上了深深的烙印。
    随着父母的相继死亡，米吉安尼就被送到南斯拉夫的神学院去学习，但是八年的修道生活并没有能把这个年青的叛逆的心灵驯服，相反地，在他后来所写的许多诗歌和短篇小说当中，却犀利地讽刺了教会和神父的伪善的仁慈。1932年米吉安尼回到了阿尔巴尼亚，他立即投身到反对索古的斗争里去，并且通过自己最初的诗歌作品“我们是新时代的儿女”、“觉醒之歌”、“青年之歌”等诗，表现出了当时进步青年的反抗的革命激情和对自由解放的渴望。他用这样的诗句燃烧起每个青年人的激动的心，鼓舞他们去从事革命斗争：
    “青年人，高唱起你们的歌，振奋起来！…………
    歌声属于我们，正像太阳照耀在天空一样！
    高唱吧，青年人！高唱起快乐的歌吧！
    振奋起来！振奋起来！你们是世界的真正的主人！”
                                      （“青年之歌”）
    “我们是新时代的儿女！
    我们的心头烈火燃烧，充满自豪，
    我们要投进决死的战斗，
    要在斗争中最后取得胜利！”
        （“我们是新时代的儿女”）
    在当时的阿尔巴尼亚，米吉安尼仅靠写作是很难养活自己的，更何况他所写出的又是充满革命激情的诗歌，于是他就到斯库台附近的农村里去当教员。这使得他有机会能更深刻地认识到阿尔巴尼亚农民的悲惨的生活，资产阶级和封建制度的所有矛盾也更加明显地呈现在他的眼前。这时候，米吉安尼接近了阿尔巴尼亚的共产主义小组，并且毫无动摇地选择了自己在社会革命斗争中的地位。不用说，这就引起了统治阶级对他进行一切可能的迫害和监视，他最后被迫不得不迁居到一个名叫普卡的偏僻的小山村里去继续当乡村教师，在当地一直住到去意大利养病时为止。
    米吉安尼的创作生活是短促的，但在1934—1938年短短的四个生产的年头当中，他写出了他最为成熟的现实主义的诗歌和散文作品。在诗歌方面，他继“觉醒之歌”之后写出了“贫困之歌”的组诗；在散文方面，他写出了“禁果”（1935年）、“樱桃”（1936年）、“玉米的传说”（1936年）、“上帝会施舍！”（1936年）、“收获”（1938年）等杰出的短篇小说。在这些作品当中，米吉安尼已摆脱了他过去惯用的浪漫主义的譬喻的手法，而是用现实主义的手法刻划出了社会生活中的严峻的现实，并且第一个把工人阶级的形象写到阿尔巴尼亚的文学作品里去。他的作品不仅发展了在阿尔巴尼亚诗歌中的战斗的传统，而且还冲破了在当时文艺界中弥漫着的资产阶级艺术的颓废主义和形式主义的氛围，超越在当时的一切诗人和作家之上，创造出真正的革命斗争的作品。不用说，伟大的苏联的存在和社会主义现实主义的文学作品，也鼓舞了米吉安尼的信心。我们知道，高尔基的长篇小说“母亲”和马雅科夫斯基的诗歌，都曾经给了米吉安尼很大的影响。
    1936年，米吉安尼的唯一的诗集“自由的诗”出版了。在这本诗集当中，收集了他所写的“复兴之歌”、“贫困之歌”、“青春之歌”、“晚年之歌”等四十几首诗。这本诗集出版之后，立即被索古政府的审查机关全部没收，只有很少的几本保留了下来，其中的诗被用手抄本的形式传遍了全国，任何防备都不能把诗人和广大的读者的联系割断。这也正如阿尔巴尼亚的名作家和诗人阿列克斯·恰奇所说的：“米吉安尼的‘自由的诗’，教育了我们整个青年一代人”。
    米吉安尼晚年的生活非常艰苦，由于患了肺病他不得不转地到意大利的都灵去治病，最后于1938年8月26日死在当地的一所疗养院里，死时二十七岁，这正是他的诗歌创作最旺盛的年代。根据阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议的决议，前年春初方从意大利把他的遗体运回来，于2月5日在诗人诞生的故乡斯库台举行了隆重的葬礼。
    米吉安尼今天为阿尔巴尼亚的人民所热爱，这并不是偶然的。他永远站在人民的立场上，他和劳动人民的思想与感情血肉相联，他用自己的战斗的诗歌来为革命服务，正因为这样，他的名字和形象永远活在阿尔巴尼亚人民的心中。他的创作生活虽然是短促的，但是他留下的仅有的一本永垂不朽的诗集，在今天不仅成为阿尔巴尼亚人民的珍贵的遗产，同时也成为全世界文化宝库的珍贵的遗产。
