　　Days and Nights on the Steel Front
　　By our reporter Zhāng Jìng
    Stepping out of Yangzhou Railway Station, walking along a bustling street, and then through several alleys, almost every household here has someone knocking on broken pottery shards. Some are even using sieves to sift it into a very fine powder. Upon inquiring, it turns out they are rushing to build iron smelting furnaces, and unable to find firebricks, they grind the pottery shards and mix them with coke powder and asphalt oil to coat the inside of the furnace. This is called "carbonaceous ramming," and it's even more fire-resistant than firebricks. A few months ago, I visited this city, and the people seemed quite unfamiliar with the word "steel." Now, many bits and pieces of impressions paint a heroic picture of this city in my mind: steelmaking and iron smelting, which were once so distant and mysterious, have now become a warm current in people's hearts.
    What people think of, they can certainly achieve. Comrades from the Municipal Party Committee told me that in just half a month, the people of the city, with soaring enthusiasm and amazing ingenuity, have erected more than seventy indigenous blast furnaces in this city that never produced steel before.
    At the Artificial Fiber Processing Factory, Director Chén Jìn led me into a courtyard where reeds were hung on all four sides. In the middle of the courtyard stood an indigenous iron smelting furnace, shaped like a drum, small at both ends and large in the middle. The furnace had no neat blue bricks on the outside, and no refractory materials on the inside. It looked like it was made entirely of mud. Yet, it continuously produced seven furnaces of molten iron day and night, and it was listed as the most consistently producing furnace in the city. Director Chén explained that because they couldn't get firebricks for a while, they tried mixing yellow mud, purple mud, white cloud sand, and pottery shard scraps as refractory materials to build this authentic indigenous furnace. The total cost of materials was only six yuan. The most ingenious thing is that this furnace is built in layers, a total of five layers up and down. Each layer can be moved flexibly. If one layer is burned out, replacing it allows iron production to continue as usual. I asked Director Chén who came up with this method? He replied, "One person can't think of it, but once everyone starts using their brains, a solution emerges."
    I also came to Yangzhou No. 1 Junior High School, where an indigenous iron smelting furnace has also been erected. More than 1,000 teachers and students have contributed labor and wisdom to this furnace. Comrade Léi Shòuyán, the school's Party Branch Secretary, took me to see the indigenous hoisting machine they created. This is a very interesting indigenous feeding machine. Placed next to the blast furnace, simply turning the handle of the winch causes the rope on the winch to drive the charging bucket upward. Reaching the top of the furnace, it automatically tilts, evenly sending the raw materials into the furnace. The person adding the materials only needs to operate below the furnace, which is both labor-saving and avoids accidents. Comrade Léi Shòuyán also showed me a blueprint for a foot-operated bellows. The blueprint is very simple, adding some mechanical action to the bellows, using foot pedals instead of hand-pulling, and the wind pressure is even greater than a blower. At a time when various equipment is very tight due to the large-scale steel production in the city, the creation of these two types of indigenous machinery is even more significant.
    Night fell, and the river breeze from the Yangtze River Bridge dispelled the heat of the day. In previous years, this was a good time for people to rest quietly and cool off, but this year, in the evening, the streets and alleys become even busier. People push carts, carry bamboo baskets, children carry small baskets, and the elderly lean on their crutches, groups and teams flowing like water to the "iron smelting joint construction site" in the suburbs. It turns out that Yangzhou not only has iron smelting furnaces in the courtyards of factories, government offices, and schools, but people have also opened up dozens of acres of open space in the suburbs to build furnaces and smelt iron collectively. I also followed the crowd to the construction site south of the Yangtze River Bridge. In the darkness, the lights on the construction site are connected in strings, and the foundation work of the furnaces is underway. The sound of people tamping the earth is deafening, and the crowds carrying bricks and mud shuttle back and forth in front of me like flying shuttles. As I was about to find some people to sit down and talk, a dozen children wearing red scarves walked by in a line, each holding a rectangular red paper package, singing as they walked. I stopped the youngest child and asked what they were doing. The child innocently raised the paper package in his hand and replied, "These are firebricks, bought with the money we saved from sweets, to send to the uncles to build the furnaces." Before I could ask any more questions, he had already broken free from my hand.
    In front of a small triangular shed, a crowd of people surrounded it, as if something had happened inside. I squeezed in and saw an old woman with a full head of silver hair sitting in the shed. She held a very delicate cane in one hand and was knocking on firebricks with a small hammer in the other. Everyone was advising her to go home and rest earlier, but the old woman refused. She said, "I have never seen such a scene in my life, and I have never heard that our Yangzhou can also produce steel. Let me come out and see it, it's worth living such a long life!" "Then old lady, you can just sit and watch, don't do any work." Someone interjected. But the old woman said, "Everyone is building socialism, how can I be idle? Even if a grain of powder I knock off can be used in the furnace, I will be happy." Someone else interjected, "Old lady, in seven more years, you will be a hundred years old, and by then, maybe we will have caught up with England!" At this time, the old woman stopped the small hammer in her hand, her eyes filled with hope and she nodded frequently, saying, "Thanks to Chairman Mao's blessing, I will definitely be able to see it." Her firm belief quickly infected the surrounding people like an invisible force, and someone in the crowd immediately said, "Yes, for this ninety-three-year-old lady, we must produce iron earlier!"
    A strong wind is blowing, and rolling sand is swirling on the construction site. Even the reed mats on the sheds are being blown away. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and it looks like there will be a rainstorm soon. But the people on the construction site don't seem to pay attention to these things at all. I walked to the iron smelting site of the handicraft workers. Here, many furnaces have already been built on their foundations, and some have been built as tall as a person. The person in charge of the construction site told me that they are going to build thirty indigenous blast furnaces here, a total of sixty cubic meters. If every furnace is fired up and produces iron, it can produce seventy tons of iron a day, and 10,000 tons of iron this year.
    Just the handicraft industry system alone is 10,000 tons. How many 10,000 tons will the whole city have!
    It's already eleven o'clock, and people are still constantly coming to the construction site. I stood on a high place, looking at the busy sea of people on the construction site, and I felt the same hope and joy as everyone else.
    Workers at the Yangzhou Machinery Factory sang a poem expressing the excitement in their hearts:
    Can't help but be full of joy and smiles,
    We want to announce to people in a loud voice,
    Yesterday we produced the first furnace of iron,
    Today the first furnace of molten steel was born.
    How proud we are to mention this,
    We created extraordinary miracles with our own hands,
    Steel, the cornerstone of the motherland's industry,
    A furnace of steel is a furnace of treasure!
    How beautiful is the magical picture,
    Blast furnaces will fill our city,
    Soaring into the clouds,
    Who would have ever thought of this in the past?
    This is all thanks to the wise leadership of the Party!

### 钢铁战线上的日日夜夜

　　钢铁战线上的日日夜夜
　　本报记者　张竞
    走出扬州车站，走过了一条热闹的大街，又穿过了好几条小巷子，这里，几乎是家家户户门口都有人在敲着碎缸片，有人还用筛子把它筛成了很细的粉末。一打听，原来他们赶制炼铁炉，找不到耐火砖，就把它磨碎了同焦炭粉、沥青油搅拌起来，搪在炉子里，这叫“炭素捣固”，比耐火砖还经烧呢。几个月以前，我到过这个城市，城市的人们对钢铁两个字似乎十分生疏；现在，许多点点滴滴的印象，在我脑子里勾出了这个城市的英雄面貌：炼钢、炼铁，本来是多么遥远，多么神秘的事，而今却成了人们心里的一股暖流。
    人们想到了的，就一定能够做到。市委的同志告诉我，仅仅半个月的功夫，全市人民已经用冲天的干劲和惊人的智慧，在这个从来不产钢铁的城市里，竖起了七十多座土高炉。
    在人造纤维加工厂，厂长陈进同志带我走进了一个四面晾着蒲草的院子里，就在院子中间，竖着一个像腰鼓一样两头小中间大的土炼铁炉，这炉子外面既没有整齐的青砖，里面也不用什么耐火材料，看上去好像全是用泥巴糊起来似的。就是它一昼夜畅流七炉铁水，就是它被列为全市出铁最正常的一只炉子。听陈厂长介绍才知道，他们因为一时弄不到耐火砖，就试用黄泥、紫泥、白云砂、缸片屑等耐火材料混合起来，搪了这么一个道地的土炉子。全部材料费用只花了六块钱。最妙的是这个炉子是一层层垒起来的，上下一共五层，每一层都可以灵活地搬动，那一层烧坏了，换掉一层就可以照常出铁。我问陈厂长这个法子是谁想出来的？他回答说：“一个人是想不出来的，可是大家一开动脑筋，办法就出来了。”
    我又来到扬州市第一初级中学，这里也竖起了土炼铁炉，全校一千多师生都为这个炼铁炉付出了劳动和智慧，学校的支部书记雷寿延同志带我去看了他们创造的土卷扬机。这是一部非常有趣的土送料机，把它架在高炉旁边，只要用手转动绞关的摇手，绞关上的绳子就带动料斗向上爬行，爬到炉顶，它会自动倾斜，把原料均匀地送到炉子里去。加料的人只要在炉子下面操作，既省力又避免出事故。雷寿延同志又给我看了一张脚踏风箱的图纸，图纸很简单，就是在风箱上加些机械的动作，用脚踏代替手拉，而且风压比鼓风机还大。在全市大搞钢铁，各种设备都非常紧张的时候，创造出这两种土机械，它的意义就更大了。
    夜幕降临了，渡江桥畔一阵阵河风驱散了白天的暑热，往年这正是人们安静地歇凉的好时刻，可是今年，一到晚上，大街小巷反而变的更加忙碌起来了。人们推着大车，抬着竹箩，孩子们提着小篮子，老年人拄着拐杖，一群群一队队像流水一样向四郊的“炼铁联合工地”流去。原来，扬州市不但是在工厂、机关、学校的院子里有炼铁炉，人们还在四郊开辟了几十亩空地，在这里集中地砌炉子炼铁。我也跟着人群来到了渡江桥南的工地上。黑夜里，工地上的灯光一串连一串，这里正在进行着炉子的基础工程。人们打夯的号子声响成一片，挑着砖头和泥块的人群飞梭似的在我面前来回穿过。我正想找些人坐下来谈谈，十几个带红领巾的孩子排着队走过来了，他们每人手里都拿了一个长方形的红纸包，边唱边走。我拉住一个最小的孩子问他们是干什么的，那孩子天真地举着手里的纸包回答我说：“这是耐火砖，是我们节省糖果费买的，给叔叔送去砌炉子的。”不等我再多问几句，他已经从我手里挣脱了。
    在一个小三角形的草棚面前，围着一堆人，好像里面发生了什么事似的，我挤进去一看，棚子里坐着一个满头银发的老太太，她一手拄着一根很细巧的拐杖，一只手拿着小鎯头在敲耐火砖，大家都在劝她早些回家休息，可是那位老太太怎么也不肯，她说：“我这一辈子没有见过这种场面，没有听说过我们扬州也能出钢铁，你们让我出来见识见识，也不枉我活了这么大岁数呀！”“那末老太太你就坐着看看得了，不要动手干了。”旁边有人插了一句。可是老太太却说：“你们大家在干社会主义，我怎么能闲着？那怕是我敲的一粒粉屑子能砌在炉子里我也高兴。”不知是谁又插了一句：“老太太，再过七年，你就是一百岁了，到那时说不定我们已经赶上英国了哩！”老太太这时停下了手里的小鎯头，眼睛里充满了希望的神彩频频地点着头说：“托毛主席的福，我一定能看到的。”她的坚定的信念，像一股无形的力量很快地感染了周围的人，人群中立刻有人说：“对，为了这位九十三岁的老太太，我们也要提早出铁！”
    起大风了，工地上刮起了滚滚的泥沙，连工棚上的芦席也卷得飞起来了，远处雷声隆隆，看样子就会有一场暴风雨来了。可是工地上的人们好像根本没有理会这些。我走到手工业工人的炼铁工地上，这里许多炉子已经打好基础，有的已经砌得有一人高了，工地上的负责人告诉我，他们将要在这里砌三十个土高炉，一共六十立方，假使每一个炉子都升火出铁，一天就可出铁七十吨，今年就可出铁一万吨。
    单单手工业系统，就是一万吨，全市该有多少个一万吨！
    已经十一点钟了，还不断有人到工地上来。我站在高处，望着工地上忙碌的人海，心里也油然生起了和大家同样的希望和喜悦。
    扬州机械厂工人用诗歌唱出了他心头的激动：
    禁不住满心欢喜满脸笑，
    我们要大着嗓音向人们宣告，
    昨天我们炼出了第一炉铁，
    今天第一炉钢水诞生了。
    提起这个我们多么骄傲，
    不平凡的奇迹我们亲手创造，
    钢，祖国工业的柱石啊，
    一炉钢水一炉宝！
    神奇的图画多么美妙，
    高炉将布满我们的城市，
    耸入云霄，
    过去谁曾这样想过？
    这都亏党的英明领导！
