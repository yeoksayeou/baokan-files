　　Big Industrial Development, Testing Keeps Up: Qinghai Geological Bureau Employs Both Indigenous and Foreign Methods for Timely Analysis of Mineral Samples

　　Xining, August 29th (reporter Li Ying) reported: The Qinghai Provincial Geological Bureau is taking both indigenous and foreign methods to break through the backward situation in testing work and promote the great development of industries such as iron and steel.

　　This year, the Qinghai Provincial Geological Bureau's exploration and survey tasks have increased several times compared to last year. As various geological teams unfolded their work with overwhelming momentum, the mineral samples sent in increased day by day. Even with the testers working overtime overnight, they couldn't keep up. In May and June alone, more than 30,000 mineral samples were backlogged. Under the pressure of the situation, laboratory personnel racked their brains to find shortcuts and engaged in a large-scale technical revolution.

　　Initially, they felt that sample crushing was the weakest link. Using a pulverizer to grind mineral samples, they could only grind twenty or thirty samples per day, while more than a thousand mineral samples were sent in daily. They researched using the medicinal mortar and iron pestle used in traditional Chinese medicine shops to crush mineral samples. The test results showed that the effect was exactly the same as grinding with a pulverizer, and the efficiency was even higher. After the efficiency of crushing samples was improved, the drying work lagged far behind. The sample drying workers changed their past practice of only drying mineral samples on sunny days. At night, they used stoves for heating and simultaneously broke the mineral samples to make them dry as quickly as possible. In this way, the sample drying work increased from a maximum of fifty per person per day to one hundred and twenty per person per day. After the efficiency of sample drying and crushing was improved, the originally larger force of testers seemed overwhelmed. Engineer and laboratory director Zhu Xinde, based on the rules of borax testing, proposed using the "methanol flame semi-quantitative elimination method" for borax testing, first eliminating the parts that were not high in quantity and had no mining value, and then conducting detailed testing on the useful parts. After adopting this method, not only was the work efficiency increased six or seven times, but also a lot of expenses were saved for the state.

　　They also made improvements in labor organization and other aspects. As a result, the tasks they completed in July were more than the total for the first half of this year, equivalent to 1.4 times the total task for last year. The cost of each index was also reduced by about one-sixth compared to last year. In order to make testing work bloom everywhere, they are holding training courses to train testing personnel for various states and counties, and to cultivate geological personnel to master rapid testing techniques.

### 工业大发展　化验紧跟上  青海地质局土洋并举及时化验矿样

　　工业大发展　化验紧跟上
    青海地质局土洋并举及时化验矿样
    本报西宁29日电　记者李瑛报道：青海省地质局采取土洋并举的办法突破化验工作的落后局面，促进钢铁等工业大发展。
    今年青海省地质局的勘探普查任务比去年增加几倍。当各个地质队以排山倒海之势展开工作以后，送来的矿样一天比一天多，化验人员连夜加班也赶不完，仅5、6月份就积压了三万多个矿样。在“形势逼人”的情况下，实验室人员个个动脑筋找窍门，大搞技术革命。
    开始时，他们感到碎样是最薄弱的一环。用粉碎机磨矿样，每天只能磨二、三十个，而每天送来的矿样有一千多个。他们研究用中药铺里使用的药碾槽和铁臼来粉碎矿样。试验结果，效果和粉碎机磨的完全一样，而且效率更高。碎样工效提高以后，晒样工作就大大跟不上了。晒样工人们便改变了过去只在晴天晒矿样的作法，在夜间用火炉加温，同时把矿样敲碎，使它尽快干燥。这样一来，晒样工作便由过去每人每天最多晒五十个提高到一人一天晒一百二十个。晒样、碎样工作效率提高以后，原来力量较大的化验人员便显得忙碌不堪了。工程师、实验室主任朱新德根据化验硼砂的规律，提出化验硼砂用“甲醇火焰半定量淘汰法”，量不高、没有开采价值的部分先淘汰掉，有用部分作详细化验。采用了这一办法以后，不仅工效提高了六、七倍，而且为国家节省了大量费用。
    在劳动组织等方面，他们也作了改进。因此，他们7月份完成的任务，比今年上半年还多，相当于去年全年任务的一点四倍。每个指数的成本也比去年降低了六分之一左右。为了使化验工作遍地开花，他们正举办训练班，为各州、县训练化验人员，并培养地质人员掌握快速化验技术。
