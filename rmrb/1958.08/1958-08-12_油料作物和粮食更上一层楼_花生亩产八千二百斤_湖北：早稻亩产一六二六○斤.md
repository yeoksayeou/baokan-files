　　Oil Crops and Grain Go to the Next Level
　　Peanut Yield of 8,200 Jin Per Mu
　　Hubei: Early Rice Yield of 16,260 Jin Per Mu
　　This newspaper reports that the youth shock brigade of the Wu Zeng Cooperative in Chenggong Township, Nan'an County, Fujian, harvested over 10,600 jin of dried peanuts from a 1.28 mu experimental plot, averaging 8,275 jin per mu.
    This newspaper reports that the Hubei Cooperative in Longhu Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, achieved an average yield of 1,143 jin of peanuts per mu across 280 mu, becoming a "thousand-jin cooperative" for peanuts. In particular, the experimental plot of 1.65 mu belonging to the ninth team of the first squadron in Xishu Village yielded over 8,000 jin of dried peanuts, averaging 5,143 jin per mu. Township Party Committee Secretaries Liu Tiantai and Zhuang Xihuang, and work team member Ji Jinfu were present during the peanut harvest. County Party Committee Secretary Zhuang Yanlin, Liang Zixin, Deputy Secretary Song Zhenlin, and Wen Zhifu, the chief procurator of Jinjiang Prefecture, also rushed to the scene for inspection.
　　This experimental plot was originally a low-yield field, with a peanut yield of only 180 jin per mu last year. During this year's spring plowing, the cooperative members moved thousands of years of lake soil from Longhu Pond to the field, applying over 7,000 dan of lake soil per mu, and 165 dan of cow manure soil and over 1,300 jin of plant ash when sowing. They also plowed and harrowed four times each, with deep plowing reaching over 1.2 chi. The seeds used were selected high-quality seeds from Tong'an, each carefully chosen, with 80 jin sown per mu. They also overcame various natural disasters during the growing process, achieving a bumper harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 11th. The record of 16,227 jin per mu of early rice created by the Gaofeng Cooperative in Shima Township, Zongyang County, Anhui Province, has been broken by the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Pingjing Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province. The new record created by this agricultural cooperative on a 1.01 mu early rice field is an average yield of 16,260 jin per mu, nearly 33 jin more than the Gaofeng Cooperative.
　　This high-yield early rice field was cultivated jointly by Xu Yifu, the Party branch secretary of the agricultural cooperative, and Cai Yexiang, the captain of the seventh production team of the cooperative, as well as Yu Kaizhi, a member of the Communist Youth League, and others. When the early rice was harvested, the Macheng County Early Rice High-Yield Inspection Team, led by Li Kecheng, the secretary of the Secretariat of the Macheng County Party Committee, and the Macheng Inspection Team of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's Early Rice High-Yield Inspection Team, went to conduct a rigorous inspection. The inspection results proved that the actual area of this field was 1.01 mu, producing a total of 16,423 jin and five liang of dried grain, with an average yield of 16,260 jin and eleven liang of dried grain per mu. According to the measurement during the inspection, each rice plant in this early rice field had an average of 11.5 ears, with approximately 3.82 million ears per mu; each ear had an average of 71 grains, and according to the test weighing, 17,680 grains weighed one jin.

    本报讯　福建南安县成功乡五曾社青年突击队的一点二八亩花生试验田，收干花生一万零六百多斤，平均亩产八千二百七十五斤。
    本报讯　福建省晋江县龙湖乡的湖北社二百八十亩花生，平均亩产一千一百四十三斤，实现了花生千斤社。其中西殊村第一中队九小队的一亩六分五厘试验田，实收干花生八千多斤。平均亩产五千一百四十三斤。收花生时，乡党委书记刘天苔、庄锡煌，工作组纪金福都在场，县委书记庄炎林、梁子新，副书记宋振林和晋江专署检察长温致福等都赶到现场验收。
    这丘试验田原是块低产田，去年亩产花生只有一百八十斤。今年春耕时，全队社员把龙湖塘千年湖土搬到地里来，每亩施下湖土七千多担，下种时施下牛粪土一百六十五担，草木灰一千三百多斤。并进行四犁四耙，深耕达一尺二寸多。种子是选用的同安良种，粒粒经过精选，每亩下种八十斤。在生长过程中又战胜了各种自然灾害，获得了丰收。
    新华社武汉11日电　安徽省枞阳县石马乡高丰社创造的早稻亩产一万六千二百二十七斤的纪录，已被湖北省麻城县平靖乡第二农业社突破了。这个农业社在一点零一亩早稻田里创造出的新纪录是，平均亩产一万六千二百六十斤，比高丰社多了将近三十三斤。
    这块早稻高产田是农业社的支部书记徐以福和该社第七生产队队长蔡业祥、共青团员俞开志等七人共同培育的。早稻收割时，以中共麻城县委书记处书记李克成为首的麻城县早稻高产验收团和中共湖北省委早稻高产验收团麻城验收组，前往进行了严格的验收。验收结果证明：这块田的实际面积是一点零一亩，共产干谷一万六千四百二十三斤五两，平均亩产干谷一万六千二百六十斤十一两。据验收时进行测算的结果看，这块早稻田每兜平均有十一点五个穗，每亩约有三百八十二万多穗；每穗平均结谷七十一粒，据试秤，一万七千六百八十粒谷重一斤。
