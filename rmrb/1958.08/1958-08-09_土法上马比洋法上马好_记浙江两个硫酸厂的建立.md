    Indigenous Methods are Superior to Foreign Methods
    ——A Record of the Establishment of Two Sulfuric Acid Plants in Zhejiang

    The sulfuric acid plants established by YuHang County and Hangzhou City in Zhejiang Province offer a stark contrast. The YuHang County Sulfuric Acid Plant adopted indigenous methods and went into production after only seven days of preparation. The Hangzhou Sulfuric Acid Plant adopted foreign methods and after more than three months of preparation, was still nowhere near completion. Later, they learned from YuHang's indigenous methods and quickly produced sulfuric acid.
    The YuHang County Sulfuric Acid Plant was built under the direct leadership of the YuHang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It mobilized manual laborers such as bricklayers, carpenters, lacquerers, pot menders, and pipe fitters to boldly break superstitions, give full play to collective wisdom, and adopt indigenous methods. Many workers said: "As long as we study hard, we can do what others cannot," "No matter how crude the method, as long as it can produce sulfuric acid, it is a good method." The workers and technicians repeatedly studied, making improvements as they worked. They used adobe bricks instead of refractory bricks to make the ore burning furnace and purifier. Inside the furnace, they also used adobe bricks coated with pine needle mud as refractory bricks capable of withstanding temperatures of 900 degrees. They then used six ordinary earthen water tanks, punching through the bottoms to form a sulfuric acid tower, and used fifty-four tanks to make nine rows of sulfuric acid towers. As a result, they manufactured sulfuric acid in just seven days. The sulfuric acid produced was of high concentration, suitable for manufacturing ammonium sulfate and superphosphate. In total, it only cost 2,000 yuan to quickly build a sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 80 tons.
    The Hangzhou Sulfuric Acid Plant began preparations in March of this year. At that time, the cadres believed that a new factory must have a complete set of automated equipment. Therefore, they asked engineers from the Shanghai Xinye Sulfuric Acid Plant to design a "mechanical furnace contact method" for extracting acid. This method required more than 7,000 tons of steel to build furnaces, conduits, and sulfuric acid towers for a plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons of sulfuric acid. This included one ton of stainless steel and eleven tons of seamless steel pipes, with a total investment of more than 500,000 yuan. It was expected to go into production in 1959. Later, it was delayed due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the plant. The second plan was changed to the "fluidized bed contact method" for extracting acid, but it still required 40 tons of steel and would not go into production until December. This was not in line with the current situation of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, which urgently required sulfuric acid. At that time, the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party required the plant to produce sulfuric acid within a month, but their minds were still focused on requesting materials from above, relying on relevant units for assistance and processing orders. They also sent two cadres to Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenyang, and other places to purchase acid-resistant pottery, but after running around for three months, they still had nothing to show for it.
    In June of this year, after the Zhejiang Provincial Three-Level Cadre Conference, the Hangzhou Sulfuric Acid Plant sent people to YuHang County to study. They saw that the indigenous methods were indeed effective, which greatly liberated their thinking. After returning, they revised their previous plans based on YuHang County's experience, boldly innovated, and worked day and night, using cement pipes from the sewer instead of acid-resistant pottery, coating the inside with a layer of raw lacquer to make sulfuric acid towers. They received assistance from fraternal factories for materials such as refractory bricks for building furnaces and cooling glass. Due to the adoption of indigenous methods, the plant only cost more than 2,000 yuan to build, and sulfuric acid flowed out in nine days.
    The employees of the Hangzhou Sulfuric Acid Plant all learned a lesson from this incident and criticized their superstitious thinking of being "reverent as gods" towards foreign methods. They believed that local medium and small-scale industries should be established using local materials, starting with indigenous methods first, then transitioning to foreign methods, starting small and then expanding. Only in this way can industrial production develop at a high speed. Currently, the two sulfuric acid plants in YuHang County and Hangzhou City are helping other agencies, factories, and schools that are preparing to build sulfuric acid plants to train technicians, and are further researching and continuing to prepare for the construction of sulfuric acid plants that combine indigenous and foreign methods.

    土法上马比洋法上马好
    ——记浙江两个硫酸厂的建立
    程敏
    浙江省余杭县和杭州市各办的硫酸厂，成了鲜明的对照。余杭县硫酸厂采用土法上马，结果只筹建了七天就投入生产；杭州硫酸厂采用洋法上马，筹建了三个多月还没有眉目。后来，还是学习了余杭的土办法，才很快地生产出硫酸。
    余杭县硫酸厂是由中共余杭县委亲自领导，发动泥工、木工、漆工、补缸匠、接管匠等手工业工人大胆破除迷信，发挥集体智慧，采用土办法建成的。许多工人说：“只要多研究，人家办不到的事我们就能办到”，“不管办法怎样土，只要能生产硫酸就是好办法”。工人们和技术人员多次研究，边做边改进，以土砖代替耐火砖制成焚矿炉和净化器，炉内也用土砖涂上松毛泥作为耐热九百度的耐火砖，又用六个普通土制的小水缸，打穿了缸底，结成一个硫酸塔，用五十四只缸做成九排硫酸塔。结果只花了七天时间就制造出硫酸。制出的硫酸浓度很高，适宜于制造硫酸铵和过磷酸钙。这样，一共只花了二千元资金，一座年产硫酸八十吨的硫酸厂很快就建成了。
    杭州硫酸厂是今年3月份开始筹建的，当时干部思想上认为新建厂就必须要有整套自动化的装备，因此就请上海新业制酸厂的工程师设计，采取“机械炉接触法”取酸，这样年产五千吨硫酸的一套机器需要七千多吨钢材建造炉灶、导管和硫酸塔等设备，其中还要用一吨不锈钢和十一吨无缝钢管，共要投资五十多万元，还要到1959年才能投入生产，后来因建厂原料有困难就拖下来了。第二次改为“沸腾炉接触法”取酸，但还是要用四十吨钢材，而且要十二月才能投入生产，和当前工农业生产大发展急需硫酸的情况不相适应。当时中共杭州市委要求这个厂一个月内制出硫酸，但他们思想上还是伸手向上要材料，依赖有关单位帮助和加工订货，还派了二个干部到上海、南京、沈阳等地采购耐酸陶器，结果奔跑了三个月还是没有着落。
    今年6月间中共浙江省三级干部会议后，杭州硫酸厂派人到余杭县去学习，看到土办法确实不错，大大解放了思想，回来后就参照余杭县的经验修正自己过去的打算，大胆创造，日夜奋战，用下水道的水泥管代替耐酸陶器，里面涂上一层生漆做成硫酸塔，造炉灶用的耐火砖及冷却玻璃等材料得到了兄弟厂的援助。由于采用土办法，这个厂建造后，只花了二千多元资金，九天时间就流出了硫酸。
    杭州市硫酸厂的职工都从这件事情中吸取教训，纷纷批判了自己对洋办法“虔敬如神”的迷信思想，认为兴办地方中小工业都应就地取材，土法先上马，先土后洋，先小后大，这样才能使工业生产高速度的发展，目前余杭县和杭州市两个硫酸厂正在帮助其他筹建硫酸厂的机关、工厂、学校培训技术人员，并且进一步研究继续筹建土洋结合的硫酸厂。
