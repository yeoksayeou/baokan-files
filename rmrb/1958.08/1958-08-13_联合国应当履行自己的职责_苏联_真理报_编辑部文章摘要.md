Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th. Pravda published an editorial on the 12th stating that the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session, convened at the initiative of the Soviet Union, will begin practical discussions tomorrow on the issues of the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. The United Nations must withstand a severe historical test. People of all countries expect the General Assembly emergency special session to take all measures to stop the aggression of the United States and Britain, and to save the people of the Near East from the interference of the imperialists in their internal affairs. If the United Nations fulfills this responsibility, it will help consolidate world peace.

The Pravda article, entitled "The United Nations Should Fulfill Its Responsibilities," pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session bears a greater responsibility. Its duty is to uphold the UN Charter, to become a genuine international organization for maintaining peace and national sovereignty, and not to act as a cover for the aggressors of the United States and Britain, who are stepping up their efforts to make it do so. The people of all countries unanimously demand that the emergency session take measures to eliminate the danger of war facing mankind, and strive to consolidate peace and ensure future security. To realize these reasonable demands of the people of all countries, it is only necessary to eliminate the factors that have created such a dangerous situation in the Middle East and aroused anxiety about the fate of future peace.

The article said that the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon and Britain's armed intervention in Jordan, the blatant interference in the internal affairs of these two countries, turning them into springboards for further adventures in the Arab East—all this brings the world to the brink of war disaster. The peace-loving people of all countries hope that the General Assembly emergency special session will demand that the United States and Britain must completely and immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Without the withdrawal of the occupying forces from these two countries, the situation in the Near East cannot be eased.

The article continued that the world public's severe protests condemning imperialist aggression, and the determination of various peace-loving countries to stop this aggression, forced the United States and Britain to abandon their initial plans to launch an attack on the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries. However, armed intervention has not stopped. The armed interventionists are still sending more armed occupying forces to Lebanon and Jordan every day. All this shows that the imperialists have not only not given up the idea of ​​maintaining their aggression against Arab countries, but are also attempting to expand this aggression. The ruling groups of the United States and Britain, carrying out the will of those monopoly capitalists who are keen on expanding colonies, especially in the oil region of the Arab East, are attempting to restore the colonial system in those countries that have recently gained independence in the harsh and tenacious anti-imperialist struggle. Therefore, the threat of war in the Near East remains very acute.

The article said that in order to ease the foreseeable criticism of the US aggressors at the General Assembly emergency special session, American newspapers are spreading rumors that the US authorities intend to "symbolically withdraw" a battalion of troops from Lebanon, thereby proving the US ruling group's desire to ease the situation in the Near East. But since the US armed intervention in Lebanon was not "symbolic," then why is the withdrawal of troops only "symbolic"? No one will allow the imperialists to mock the Arab people!

The article refuted one by one the excuses of Western countries attempting to cover up their imperialist plans and armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. The article then pointed out that now the armed interventionists are trying to steal the banner of the United Nations to cover up their aggressive acts. The article emphasized that the imperialists should keep in mind that the national liberation movement is irresistible, the colonial era is gone forever, and any attempt to maintain and restore colonial rule will harm the cause of peace and is doomed to bankruptcy.

　　联合国应当履行自己的职责
　　苏联“真理报”编辑部文章摘要
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”12日发表编辑部的文章说，由苏联倡议召开的联合国大会紧急特别会议明天就要开始实际讨论美英两国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的问题了。联合国应当经得起严重的历史考验。各国人民期望，联大紧急特别会议采取一切措施，停止美英两国的侵略，挽救近东各国人民免于帝国主义者对他们的内政的干涉。如果联合国尽到自己的这种职责，这将有助于世界和平的巩固。
    “真理报”的这篇题为“联合国应当履行自己的职责”的文章指出，联合国大会紧急特别会议负有更大的责任。它的职责是维护联合国宪章，成为维护和平和国家主权的真正国际组织，不作美英两国侵略者的掩护，而美英两国正在加紧促使它作这种掩护。各国人民一致要求紧急会议采取措施来消除人类所面临的战争危险，并争取巩固和平，确保未来的安全。要实现各国人民这些合理的要求，只有消除产生中近东如此危险的局面和引起对今后和平的命运不安的那些因素。
    文章说，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩和英国武装干涉约旦，对这两个国家的内政的粗暴干涉，把它们变为在阿拉伯东方进一步进行冒险的跳板——这一切使世界濒于战争灾难的边缘。各国爱好和平的人民希望联大紧急特别会议要求美英两国必须完全地、立即把军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。不把占领军从这两个国家撤出去，中近东的局势就不能得到缓和。
    文章接着说，世界公众谴责帝国主义侵略的严重抗议，各个爱好和平国家制止这种侵略的决心，迫使美英两国放弃了最初想对伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家发动进攻的计划。但是，武装干涉还没有停止。武装干涉者每天还在往黎巴嫩和约旦增派武装占领部队。这一切都说明，帝国主义者不仅没有放弃想维持对阿拉伯国家的侵略的念头，而且还在企图扩大这种侵略。美英两国的统治集团执行着那些热衷于扩大殖民地、特别是在阿拉伯东方石油地区扩大殖民地的垄断资本的意志，企图在那些不久前在严酷和顽强的反帝斗争中获得独立的国家中恢复殖民主义制度，因此，中近东的战争威胁仍旧还很尖锐。
    文章说，美国报纸为了缓和在联大紧急特别会议上对美国侵略者的可以料到的批评，便散布这样一些流言，说美国当局打算从黎巴嫩“象征性地撤退”一营军队，以此证明美国统治集团缓和中近东局势的愿望。但是既然美国武装干涉黎巴嫩不是“象征性”的，那么为什么撤军却只是“象征性”的呢？任何人都不容许帝国主义者嘲弄阿拉伯人民！
    文章一一驳斥了西方国家企图掩饰自己的帝国主义计划和武装侵犯黎巴嫩和约旦的借口。文章接着指出，现在武装干涉者又在企图盗用联合国的旗帜来掩饰自己的侵略行为。文章强调说，但是，帝国主义者应该牢牢地记住，民族解放运动是不可抗拒的，殖民主义时代已经一去不复返了，任何想维持和挽回殖民主义统治的企图都会给和平事业带来危害，而且是注定要破产的。
