　　What are the uses of alcohol?
    Alcohol has a wide range of uses and is urgently needed for industrial and agricultural production.
    1. It can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines, powering tractors, irrigation and drainage, agricultural product processing plants, and various small factories. This allows for local sourcing and significantly reduces fuel costs. 90-proof alcohol has about the same effectiveness as mixed diesel.
    2. It can be used as an extraction agent in the oil industry. Using the extraction method, 10 kilograms of alcohol extraction agent is required per ton of oilseed, and 3 to 7 additional catties of oil can be extracted per 100 catties of oil cake.
    3. It can be used to manufacture synthetic rubber. During the Second Five-Year Plan, China's synthetic rubber industry will see significant development, with two-thirds of the raw materials relying on alcohol. With rubber, it will be conducive to the development of various related industries, and it can vigorously produce tires, greatly promoting vehicle use.
    4. It can be used as a raw material for other chemical industries. Such as plastics, dyes, coatings, pesticides, detergents, artificial fibers, cosmetics, and hygiene and medicine, etc.

　　酒精有哪些用途？
    酒精用途很广，而且是工、农业生产所急需。
    一、可以作内燃机燃料，用作拖拉机、排灌动力，农产品加工厂以及各类小型工厂的动力。这样可以就地取材，大大降低燃料成本。九十度的酒精，效力同混合柴油差不多。
    二、可以作油脂工业浸出剂。采用浸出法，每吨油料需用酒精浸出剂十公斤，每百斤油饼可多出三至七斤油。
    三、可以制造合成橡胶。第二个五年计划内，我国人造橡胶将有很大的发展，其中三分之二的原料须依靠酒精。有了橡胶，就有利于各种有关工业的发展，并可大力生产车胎，大大促进车子化。
    四、可作其他化学工业原料。如塑料、染料、涂料、农药、洗涤剂、人造纤维、化妆品以及卫生医药等等。
