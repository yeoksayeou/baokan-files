Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 13th: In order to better support the comprehensive agricultural bumper harvest and great industrial development, the commercial departments of Henan Province are launching a mass inspection and comparison campaign throughout the province.

Currently, eight inspection, evaluation, and visiting delegations have been organized in seven special districts, including Shangqiu, Xuchang, Nanyang, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, and Xinyang, and nine cities, including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Each county has also established sub-delegations. More than 10,000 commercial employees are participating in the inspection, which commenced on the 11th. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to this inspection and evaluation of financial and trade work. The secretaries of the prefectural and county committees in charge of financial and economic work are personally leading the work of the visiting delegations. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also established a Henan Provincial Financial and Trade Work Inspection and Evaluation Committee.

The main content of this inspection is, first and foremost, to complete the current task of agricultural tool reform and to prepare for the reform of various water conservancy tools for this winter and next spring. At the same time, the province is also required to complete the reform of various tools for processing, loading, unloading, and transportation within the commercial departments themselves in August, achieving semi-mechanization. Secondly, in light of the bumper harvest of grain and various cash crops this year, it is necessary to do a good job in the purchase, processing, transportation, and storage of agricultural products, and to drive the development of local industries in townships and communes through the processing of agricultural products. Thirdly, through inspection and evaluation, efforts should be made to promote the supply of consumer goods and means of production in the peak season market in various regions. The shortage of transportation capacity is a new problem that has emerged after this year's bumper harvest. To solve this problem, the province will complete the ball bearing conversion of transportation tools in August through inspection and evaluation.

Visiting delegations from various regions will adopt the method of visiting, learning, inspecting, evaluating, summarizing, and promoting simultaneously. They will set up models in commercial work throughout the province, rapidly setting off a high tide of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and serving the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

　　支持农具改革做好收购供应工作
　　河南开展商业大检查
    据新华社郑州13日电　河南省商业部门为了更好地支持农业全面大丰收和工业大发展，正在全省范围内开展一个群众性的大检查、大评比运动。
    现在，商丘、许昌、南阳、洛阳、开封、新乡、信阳等七个专区和郑州、开封等九个市已组织了八个检查评比参观团，各个县也都成立了分团，参加检查的商业职工有一万多人，11日已经开始出发。各级党委对这次财贸工作的检查评比都非常重视，各个地委和县委负责财经工作的书记，都亲自领导参观团工作，中共河南省委也专门成立了河南省财贸工作检查评比委员会。
    这次检查的主要内容首先是突击完成当前的农具改革任务，做好今冬明春各种水利工具改革的准备工作。同时，还要求全省在8月份突击完成商业部门本身的加工、装卸、运输等各种工具的改革，实现半机械化。其次是根据今年粮食和各种经济作物大丰收的情况，做好农产品采购、加工、运输、保管工作，并且通过农产品的加工，把乡乡社社的地方工业带动起来。第三，通过检查评比要促进各地做好旺季市场的生活资料和生产资料的供应工作。交通运输力量不足，是今年农业大丰收后出现的一个新的问题，为了解决这一问题，通过检查评比，8月份全省要突击完成运输工具滚珠轴承化。
    各地参观团将采取边参观、边学习、边检查、边评比、边总结、边推广的办法，在全省商业工作中树立旗帜，迅速掀起一个学先进、赶先进，为工农业生产大跃进服务的高潮。
