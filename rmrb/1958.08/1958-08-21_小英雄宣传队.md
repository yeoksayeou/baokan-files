　　Little Heroes Propaganda Team
    On the eve of the opening of the first Party Congress in Jixi City, Heilongjiang Province, a propaganda team composed of seventy-three children appeared on the streets. Sixty percent of these children were unschooled children aged five to seven. Leading this propaganda team was a 45-year-old housewife, Yang Chunzhang. Her eyesight was a bit weak, and she had to wear reading glasses to do work. She was very busy with housework. However, because she loved all new things in the new society, she had done a lot of social work in the Nangang area of Jixi in recent years, and was loved and supported by the families here.
    After the Party put forward the general line of socialism, Yang Chunzhang, regardless of fatigue, busied herself day and night among her neighbors, organizing unschooled children and forming a strong Little Heroes Propaganda Team.
    Using short allegro verses, recitation poems, etc., they conducted propaganda among the families of workers. Especially when American and British imperialism invaded Lebanon and Jordan, this heroic propaganda team went to the streets to conduct propaganda. Under the leadership of Granny Yang, they compiled a lot of allegro verses. Now the children in the Nangang area can sing them. Here is an allegro verse: "I am a native expert, unafraid of heaven or earth. Plant evergreen trees that bloom with unfading flowers in all four seasons. Harvest is rich year after year, season after season, with gold and silver treasures filling the world."

　　小英雄宣传队
    在黑龙江省鸡西市首届党代大会开幕的前夕，街头上出现了一支由七十三个孩子组成的宣传队，这些孩子60％是五岁到七岁的没有上过学的孩子，领导这个宣传队的是一位四十五岁的家庭妇女杨纯章，她眼有点花，做起活来要带上花镜，家务事非常繁忙。但是由于她热爱新社会的一切新事物，几年来她在鸡西南岗地区作了许多的社会工作，受到了这里家属们的爱戴和拥护。
    党提出社会主义总路线以后，杨纯章不顾疲劳，朝夕奔忙于左邻右舍，组织了没有上过学的孩子，成立了一支坚强的小英雄宣传队，
    以短小的快板、朗诵诗等向职工家属进行宣传，尤其是在美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦时，这支英雄的宣传队跑到街头上进行宣传。在杨大娘领导下，他们编了不少快板，现在南岗地区的孩子们都会唱了，下面是快板：“我是一个土专家天不怕来地不怕，种下万年常青树，开了四季不败花，年年丰收季季红，金银财宝满天下。”
