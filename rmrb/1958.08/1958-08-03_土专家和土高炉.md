Local Experts and Indigenous Blast Furnaces
By our reporters Fan Yinhuai and Wu Zanting

Every part of the indigenous blast furnace at the Yingchao Iron Works shines with the wisdom of local experts. This kind of indigenous blast furnace is similar in shape to ordinary indigenous blast furnaces, but it doesn't use a single piece of steel plate or firebrick, but is built with green bricks, sand, and stones in a spiral; it can produce high-quality pig iron, but it doesn't use coke and hot blast equipment like ordinary iron smelters, but uses cold air to blow in anthracite coal to melt the ore....

Old technician Fu Shukun is a person who has suffered the pain of indigenous iron smelting. Before liberation, he spent more than thirty years in the handicraft iron smelting workshops of landlords and rich peasants. Now he is a well-known indigenous iron smelting technician in the county. In the past two years, he has been running around trying to reform indigenous iron smelting technology. He searched for experience in smelting iron with anthracite coal, but all failed.

Each failure strengthened Fu Shukun's determination to experiment. He lay down at the foot of the furnace every day thinking: Why can't anthracite coal melt the ore? He found that the air duct of this furnace was too high and delivered air horizontally, which could not melt the ore below. So he and another old technician, Yuan Fenglin, built a plough-shaped furnace with mud mixed with wheat straw, and tilted the air duct downwards a lot. At the same time, he carefully added materials and adjusted the furnace temperature. As a result, seven or eight kilograms of pig iron were smelted with anthracite coal. The success of this small-scale experiment immediately caused a sensation in the whole village. Everyone said: Ambitious people must not always follow in the footsteps of others.

Fu Shukun has figured out the characteristics of many kinds of iron smelting furnaces in recent years. He believes that the disadvantage of the plough-shaped furnace is that the air duct is not smooth. Although the indigenous blast furnace is backward, the air duct can evenly distribute the air into the furnace to burn anthracite coal. They studied the advantages of various blast furnaces and came up with a blast furnace design with a high furnace body, plough-shaped furnace waist, square furnace air duct, and round furnace tuyere, which was supported by Wang Depu, deputy director of the county Party committee's industry department and director of the county handicraft cooperative.

The whole cooperative has dozens of production workers, and everyone worked together. In a few days, an indigenous blast furnace with a volume of 1.5 cubic meters was built. But using anthracite coal could only burn the ore into slag, and no molten iron could be produced. Fu Shukun paid attention to finding the reason for producing slag but not iron. He found that although the air duct of the indigenous blast furnace was good according to the original shape of the indigenous square furnace, the volume of the blast furnace was too large, and only one air duct could not evenly diffuse the air. He also set up two more air ducts at the foot of the furnace, and the blast furnace was able to produce some molten iron.

The county Party committee proposed to the Yingchao Iron Works: to produce a kind of grey pig iron on the indigenous furnace to be used as castings for machinery and equipment.

Grey pig iron requires greater air power and higher air temperature. Building a hot blast stove requires an investment equivalent to four indigenous blast furnaces, and the handicraft cooperative cannot come up with this amount of money. Therefore, he decided to try to smelt grey pig iron on an indigenous blast furnace that used cold air.

Fu Shukun found that when others were experimenting with grey pig iron on furnaces that circulated hot air, the wind force was reduced due to the long ventilation distance. He then thought of moving the blower that sent cold air to the indigenous blast furnace closer to the furnace to increase the wind force. He also learned from an engineer from Beijing how to scientifically batch and feed materials to increase the furnace temperature, and appropriately increased the amount of anthracite coal and limestone. As a result, he actually used anthracite coal to smelt grey pig iron on an indigenous blast furnace that circulated cold air.

Whether anthracite coal can be used to smelt iron has been a hot debate. Most people believe that anthracite coal is far less powerful than coke, and pure anthracite coal smelting has never been seen in Chinese and foreign metallurgical professional books. Now this technical debate has been concluded by the local experts of Yingchao Iron Works. (Attached picture)

    土专家和土高炉
    本报记者　范银怀　武赞庭
    应朝铁业社的土高炉每部分都闪耀着土专家们智慧的光芒。这种土高炉和一般土高炉的形体差不多，但不用一块钢板和耐火砖，而是青砖、砂石砌旋；它能出优质生铁，却不是一般炼铁厂那样用焦炭和热风设备，而是冷风鼓吹无烟煤熔化矿石……。
    老技师傅树昆是饱受土法炼铁痛苦的人，解放前他在地主、富农的手工炼铁作坊里熬过了三十多年。现在是全县鼎鼎有名的土法炼铁技师。这两年来他为改革土法炼铁技术，到处奔走。寻找无烟煤炼铁的经验，结果都失败了。
    每次失败使傅树昆更增强了试验的毅力。他每天伏在炉脚下琢磨：无烟煤为什么化不了矿石？他发现这种炉的风道过高又是平直送风，化不了下边的矿石。于是他就和另一位老技工原凤麟一起用泥土掺麦稞筑了个犁面炉，把风道向下倾斜了许多。同时精心下料，调剂炉温。结果用无烟煤炼出了七八斤生铁。这次小型试验的成功，立即轰动了全村。大家都说：有志气的人绝不能老照别人的脚印走路。
    傅树昆这几年来摸透了许多种炼铁炉的脾气。他认为犁面炉的缺点是风道不顺畅。土高炉虽落后，但风道能把风均匀地散在炉内燃烧无烟煤。他们研究了各种高炉的优点，想出一种高炉身、犁炉腰、方炉风道、圆炉风嘴的高炉图案，受到县委工业部副部长、县手工业社主任王德普的支持。
    全社有几十个生产工人，大家一齐动手。不几天，一座一点五立方公尺的土高炉建立起来了。但是用无烟煤只能把矿石烧成渣，出不了铁水。傅树昆注意找寻出渣不出铁的原因。发现土高炉的风道按原来土方炉的形状固然好，但高炉容积大了，只一个风道不能让风均匀地扩散开。他又在炉脚下另设了两个风道，高炉算是能出些铁水了。
    县委向应朝铁业社提出：要在土炉上生产一种作为机器设备铸件的灰生铁。
    灰生铁需要更大的风力和更高的风温。建一座热风炉，需要相当于四座土高炉的投资，手工业社是无法拿出这笔资金的。因此他决定在通冷风的土高炉上打着炼灰生铁的主意。
    傅树昆发现别人在通热风的炉上试验灰生铁时，因通风路程长了，减少了风力，他就想法把给土高炉送冷风的风机移近炉旁，增大了风力。他又向北京来的一位工程师学习科学地配料、下料来提高炉温的办法，适当增加了无烟煤和石灰石，果真在通冷风的土高炉上，用无烟煤也炼出了灰生铁。
    能不能用无烟煤炼铁曾经发生过热烈的争论。多数人认为无烟煤远不如焦炭的强力大，中外冶金专业书籍上也没有见过纯用无烟煤炼铁的，现在这场技术辩论让应朝铁业社的土专家们作了结论。（附图片）
