Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th - The Southern Sheep Raising On-Site Conference was held in Chongde County, Zhejiang Province, from August 5th to 9th. Through visits, exchanges, experience sharing, and open debate, the conference eliminated the superstitious and conservative ideas that sheep cannot be raised in plain agricultural areas and that fine-wool sheep cannot be raised in the south. It was unanimously agreed that all regions of the country can raise not only goats but also sheep; not only coarse-wool sheep but also fine-wool sheep. The conference emphasized that southern provinces (regions) and cities should vigorously develop sheep production, focusing on collective breeding, while actively assisting households in raising sheep.

This conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Second Ministry of Commerce. Attendees included the heads and cadres of the agricultural and commercial departments of ten southern provinces (regions) and cities, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Shanghai. Relevant departments from Sichuan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang also sent representatives to participate in the conference.

According to the discussions at this conference, the southern ten provinces and cities have many favorable conditions for developing sheep production: abundant rainfall, a long frost-free period, evergreen vegetation year-round, rapid sheep reproduction, high returns, the urgent desire of the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members to develop sheep production, and advanced experiences and high-speed development models. According to statistics, these ten provinces (regions) and cities had eight million sheep in 1957, an increase of 178% compared to 1949 at the time of liberation. Among these, in addition to more than six million three hundred thousand goats, there were also more than one million six hundred thousand sheep, which is a significant achievement.

However, due to the weak foundation of sheep raising in these areas, the development of sheep far cannot meet the needs of the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives. The total number of sheep in the southern ten provinces and cities is less than 10% of the total number of sheep in the country. Calculated on the basis of two hundred and fifty million people in these areas, there is an average of only one sheep for every thirty people, and the distribution of sheep is very uneven. Jiangsu and Zhejiang have more sheep, accounting for more than half of these areas; Jiangxi Province, which has the fewest sheep, has only more than forty thousand sheep. The same is true within a province. In Zhejiang Province, 70% of the sheep are distributed in the Jiaxing area.

In these areas, some cadres and farmers have right-leaning conservative ideas and superstitious thoughts. Some believe that the southern climate is hot and humid, not suitable for sheep growth, and sheep cannot be raised; some believe that agricultural areas do not have pastures and sheep cannot be raised; some believe that raising goats has low economic value. These ideas seriously hinder the development of sheep raising.

At this on-site conference, the representatives listened to the situation and experience introduction of the high-speed development of sheep production in Chongde, Haining, and Wuxing counties in Jiaxing area of Zhejiang Province, which have achieved remarkable results in sheep raising, and also conducted on-site visits to the Sixth Agricultural Cooperative of Huxiao Township, Chongde County, and the Jianyi Agricultural Cooperative of Shijing Township, Haining County. These three counties currently have six hundred and thirty thousand sheep, with an average of 2.3 sheep per household, and more than twenty ten-thousand-sheep townships have emerged. Wherever the representatives went, they saw that every cooperative raised sheep, every household raised sheep, everyone raised sheep, the "five-guarantee households" raised sheep, and even children raised sheep. Sheep raising production has become a mass movement. Due to the large number of sheep, there is a lot of manure, which has played a significant role in the bumper harvest of rice this year. The early rice in Haining and Chongde counties has yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu, and due to sheep raising, the production of animal products such as hides, wool, and meat has increased, supporting socialist construction and export materials. These three counties are all located in the Hangjiahu Plain area south of Taihu Lake, with the climatic characteristics of the south, and do not have large areas of grassland, but the Huzhou sheep and sheep here grow particularly well, and the number increases year by year.

Why has sheep production in Chongde, Haining, and Wuxing counties been able to develop so vigorously? This on-site conference believes that the main experiences are: First, the party and government leading departments have strengthened the leadership of sheep production in the comprehensive leap forward of agricultural production and adopted the method of combining the development of sheep production with increasing the income of the masses to mobilize and support the masses to raise sheep. Second, vigorously breed, retain more and slaughter less, and expand the female livestock group. Third, correctly implemented the price policy that is conducive to the development of production. Fourth, pay attention to opening up more sources of feed.

The conference emphasized that sheep production in southern provinces and cities should develop at a high speed. While developing quantity on a large scale, it should actively improve quality. In terms of sheep, vigorously develop Huzhou sheep; in terms of goats, develop meat goats and milk goats. The main measures for developing sheep production are: First, vigorously breed, establish breeding bases in areas with an existing sheep raising base; in areas with fewer sheep, rely mainly on self-reliance to quickly achieve self-breeding and self-raising; at the same time, advocate the spirit of communist cooperation among regions and adjust each other. Second, retain more and slaughter less, expand the proportion of ewes in the flock, and continue to establish state-owned and collective breeding sheep farms. Third, do a good job in feeding and management. Fourth, strengthen purchasing and marketing.

### 南方也能养绵羊　南方各省决定高速度发展养羊生产

　　南方也能养绵羊
　　南方各省决定高速度发展养羊生产
    据新华社杭州11日电　南方养羊现场会议8月5日至9日在浙江省崇德县举行。会议通过参观、访问、经验交流和鸣放辩论，破除了所谓平原农业区不能养羊、南方不能养绵羊的迷信思想和保守思想，一致认为：全国所有地区不仅可以养山羊，也可以养绵羊；不仅可以养粗毛羊，也可以养细毛羊。会上强调南方各省（区）市应大力发展养羊生产，以集体饲养为主，同时积极帮助家庭养羊。
    这个会议是由农业部和第二商业部联合召开的。到会的有浙江、江苏、福建、广东、广西、湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、上海等十个南方省（区）市的农业、商业部门的负责人和干部，四川、贵州、青海、内蒙、黑龙江等地区的有关部门也派人参加这个会议。
    根据这个会议的讨论，南方十个省市发展养羊生产的有利条件是很多的，雨量充沛，无霜期长，一年四季常青，羊繁殖快，收益大，广大农业社社员有发展养羊生产的迫切要求，又有了发展养羊生产的先进经验和高速度发展的榜样。据统计，这十个省（区）市1957年有羊八百万头，比解放的1949年增加178％，其中除六百三十多万头山羊外，还有一百六十多万头绵羊，成绩是很大的。
    但是由于这些地区养羊基础薄弱，羊的发展远不能满足当前工农业生产大跃进和人民生活的需要，南方十个省市养羊的总头数尚不及全国养羊总头数的10％，以这些地区两亿五千万人口计算，平均每三十个人才有一头羊，而且羊分布很不平衡。江苏、浙江养羊较多，约占这些地区的半数以上；养羊最少的江西省只有四万多头羊。在一个省内也是如此，浙江省70％的羊分布在嘉兴专区。
    在这些地区，有些干部和农民存在右倾保守思想和迷信思想，有的认为南方气候炎热、潮湿，不适于绵羊生长，不能养绵羊；有的认为农业区没有草场，不能养羊；有的认为养山羊经济价值低。这些思想严重地阻碍了养羊事业的发展。
    在这次现场会议上，代表们听取了养羊有显著成绩的浙江省嘉兴专区崇德、海宁、吴兴三个县高速度发展养羊生产的情况和经验介绍，又到崇德县虎啸乡第六农业社、海宁县石井乡建一农业社进行实地参观访问。这三个县目前已养羊六十三万头，平均每户二点三头，出现了二十多个万羊乡。代表们所到的地方，看到社社养，户户养，人人养，五保户养，小孩子也养，养羊生产已经成了群众性的运动。由于养羊多，积肥多，对今年稻谷大丰收起了很大作用。海宁、崇德两县的早稻都在亩产一千斤以上，而且由于养羊，增产了皮、毛、肉等畜产品，支援了社会主义建设和出口物资。这三个县都属于太湖以南的杭嘉湖平原地区，具有南方的气候特点，也没有大面积的草原，但这里的湖羊、绵羊生长的特别好，数量一年比一年多。
    为什么崇德、海宁、吴兴三县的养羊生产能够这样蓬勃发展呢？这次现场会议认为主要经验有：首先是党政领导部门，在农业生产全面大跃进中，加强了对养羊生产的领导，采取了发展养羊生产和增加群众收益相结合的办法，发动和扶持群众养羊。第二、大力繁殖，多留少宰，扩大母畜群。第三、正确执行了有利发展生产的价格政策。第四、注意多方开辟饲料来源。
    会议强调南方各省市养羊生产应以高速度发展，在大量发展数量的同时，积极提高质量。在绵羊方面，大力发展湖羊；在山羊方面，一面发展肉用羊，一面发展奶山羊。发展养羊生产的主要措施是：一、大力繁殖，在已有养羊基础的地区建立繁殖基地；在羊少的地区以自力更生为主，迅速做到自繁自养；同时，提倡地区之间发挥共产主义协作精神，互相调剂。二、多留少宰，扩大母羊在羊群中的比重，继续建立国营的和集体的种羊场。三、做好饲养管理工作。四、加强购销工作。
