The Chiang Kai-shek Clique's Disgusting Pro-Foreign Sycophancy
Disobedient Mosquitoes "Lacking Discernment" Bite Americans
Terrifying Senior Bureaucrats Who Hastily Allocate Special Funds for Investigation

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th Dispatch from Taipei: Recently, in the "Taipei Guest House," used by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to accommodate American military and government personnel, some Americans were bitten by poisonous mosquitoes, fell ill, and flew into a rage at Taiwanese Kuomintang officials, scaring the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Mayor of Taipei into a frenzy. This "Strange Case of the Poisonous Mosquitoes" has become a laughingstock throughout Taiwan.

Taiwanese newspapers reported that the Chiang gang's "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" recently sent a letter to Taipei Mayor Huang Chi-jui, which stated: "Recently, several friends (referring to Americans) in Taipei have been poisoned, attacked by mosquitoes, and have suffered from fever, swelling, and pain..." The letter then instructed Huang Chi-jui to "order the health authorities to investigate" and requested a response from Huang Chi-jui.

Huang Chi-jui, nicknamed the "Fish-Eating Mayor" for his monthly expenditure of three hundred US dollars on "fish fees," panicked upon receiving the letter and hastily ordered the Taipei City Health Institute to allocate special funds to temporarily form a "Mosquito Eradication Team" specifically responsible for investigating the presence of poisonous mosquitoes in the "Taipei Guest House."

Senior officials of the Chiang gang then ordered the Taiwan Provincial Malaria Research Institute, located in Pingtung County, to send personnel to investigate the "Taipei Guest House." Furthermore, the Kuomintang's "Central News Agency" published a news item in both Chinese and English, "Experts to Be Invited to Identify Whether There Are Poisonous Mosquitoes in the Guest House," to express their meticulous flattery of their "American allies."

This "Strange Case of the Poisonous Mosquitoes" fully exposes the Chiang Kai-shek clique's disgusting pro-foreign sycophancy. Taiwan is notorious for its abundance of mosquitoes and flies and the prevalence of malaria. Taiwanese newspapers report that 6.5 million residents of Taiwan live in malaria-prone areas. There are thirteen genera and more than eighty species of mosquitoes in Taiwan, with the most common genera being Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles. Taipei is also notorious for its abundance of mosquitoes and the prevalence of malaria. However, the officials of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique have consistently turned a blind eye to the serious situation of Taiwanese compatriots suffering from mosquito and fly-borne diseases year-round. Yet, when a few Americans are bitten by mosquitoes, they immediately display this pathetic slave mentality.

When reporting on this "Strange Case of the Poisonous Mosquitoes," one Taiwanese newspaper sarcastically wrote, "Although the sanitary facilities of the Taipei Guest House are good, it is difficult to guarantee that mosquitoes will not sneak in. Mosquitoes are blind and indiscriminate; they treat everyone equally, regardless of wealth, poverty, nobility, or status, Chinese or foreigners. The fact that biting a few foreign guests would cause such panic among the officials was something that the mosquitoes never expected." (Attached Picture)

### 蒋介石集团媚外丑态  毒蚊“不识相”咬了美国人  吓坏高级官僚忙拨专款调查

    蒋介石集团媚外丑态
    毒蚊“不识相”咬了美国人
    吓坏高级官僚忙拨专款调查
    新华社5日讯　台北消息：在蒋介石集团用来招待美国军政人员住宿的“台北宾馆”内，最近一些美国人被毒蚊咬了生病，向台湾国民党官员大发脾气，把蒋介石集团的所谓外交部长和台北市长等吓得手忙脚乱，闹作一团。这一宗“毒蚊奇案”已经成为传遍台湾各地的笑柄。
    台湾报纸说，蒋帮的“外交部”在不久前写了一封信给台北市长黄启瑞，其中说：“近日台北市友人（指美国人）中毒，为蚊所侵，而致发热肿痛者已有数起……”。跟着嘱黄启瑞“饬卫生当局调查”并且要黄启瑞答复。
    因每月开支三百美元“吃鱼费”被称为“吃鱼市长”的黄启瑞，接到这封信后，慌忙命令台北市卫生院拨出专款，临时凑成了一个“灭蚊队”，专门负责到“台北宾馆”调查有没有毒蚊。
    蒋帮高级官僚跟着又命令设在屏东县的台湾省疟疾研究所派人到“台北宾馆”调查，并且由国民党“中央社”用中英文发表了“宾馆有无毒蚊，将邀专家鉴定”的消息，以表达他们对“美国盟友”的奉承是无微不至的。
    这一宗“毒蚊奇案”，充分暴露了蒋介石集团媚外的丑态。台湾是以蚊蝇很多、疟疾流行著名的地方。台湾报纸说，台湾全省居民有六百五十万人住在疟疾流行地区内。台湾的蚊子有十三属、八十多种，最多的蚊属有家蚊、黑斑蚊、疟蚊等。台北市也是以蚊多和疟疾流行出名的。可是，对于台湾同胞终年受着蚊蝇疾病侵袭的严重情形，台湾蒋介石集团的官员们一直熟视无睹。而几个美国人被蚊咬了，他们立刻显出了这一付狼狈的奴才相。
    一家台湾报纸报道这一宗“毒蚊奇案”的时候冷嘲热讽地写道，“台北宾馆的卫生设备虽然好，但也难保蚊子不偷溜进去。蚊虫是有眼无珠的，它们不分贫富贵贱，不分中国人还是外国人，一律看待。咬了几个外宾而会引起衮衮诸公的慌乱，实非蚊子始料所及。”（附图片）
