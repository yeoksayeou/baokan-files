    No Nuclear Weapon Explosions Allowed by the United States
    Commentator of This Newspaper
    According to data obtained by observation stations of our country's scientific organs, it is proved that since April this year, U.S. imperialism has been continuously conducting intense nuclear weapon explosion tests in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific high seas, causing a sharp increase in the deposition of radioactive dust in the air in the southeastern coastal areas of our country. According to a Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese ships "Takuyo" and "Satsuma," engaged in marine observation work near the equator on July 14, have suffered from radioactive dust caused by U.S. nuclear explosion tests, and thirty-seven crew members are suffering from life-threatening leukopenia. Obviously, this is another serious crime by the United States that endangers the lives of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of Asian countries.
    Chinese scientists pointed out that the U.S. military authorities, disregarding the opposition of people all over the world, deliberately chose the spring and summer seasons to conduct nuclear explosions in the Marshall Islands. Their intention is extremely malicious. Because during this period, seasonal winds carrying radioactive materials, according to the laws of atmospheric circulation, will blow more from the Pacific Ocean across the southeastern coast of China, Japan, and Korea, and will not blow to U.S. territory and territorial waters. It can be seen from this that the U.S. military authorities deliberately want to use this to harm the people of China, Korea, Japan, and other Asian countries. This is obviously an extremely despicable crime. People can see from this incident what a despicable group of robbers and murderers are in power in the White House and the Pentagon in the United States.
    In order to deceive the people of various countries, the U.S. authorities have loudly claimed that the United States is exploding a "clean" hydrogen bomb in the Pacific region. This shameless lie has been completely exposed by the evil black hands of the United States itself. The thirty-seven Japanese crew members who have been harmed by this "clean" hydrogen bomb of the United States are bloody witnesses.
    The people of Asia and all peace-loving people in the world will not forget that the U.S. nuclear explosion test conducted on Bikini Island in the Marshall Islands in 1954 caused serious disasters to the Japanese people and the people of Asia. Twenty-three crew members of the Japanese fishing boat "Fukuryu Maru No. 5" were injured, and Aikichi Kuboyama died tragically. The rain and snow that fell along the coasts of Japan and China that year contained a large amount of toxic radioactive material, and Japanese fishermen suffered greatly. This crime by the United States aroused the great anger of every conscientious person in the world. Since then, people of all countries have launched a powerful movement against nuclear explosion tests. However, the United States, disregarding the universal wishes of the people of the world and the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union to promote the universal cessation of nuclear explosions by unilaterally halting nuclear weapon tests, has continued to conduct nuclear explosion tests in the Pacific region. According to materials recorded by observation stations of Soviet scientific organs published by TASS, the United States conducted thirty-two nuclear weapon explosion tests in the Pacific region in less than three months from April 28 to July 26. In 1954, the United States conducted three nuclear explosions in Bikini from March 1 to April 6, which caused such serious disasters; this time, not only was the number of explosions ten times greater than that time, but the time lasted for three months, so its threat to the lives and safety of the people of Asian countries in the Pacific region must be even more serious. The disasters suffered by the "Takuyo" and "Satsuma" are only two examples that have been identified.
    While colluding with Britain to invade the Middle East, the United States is also stepping up nuclear weapon explosions in the Pacific region. Its purpose is obviously not only to harm the people of Asian countries, but also to poison the entire international atmosphere. This heinous behavior of U.S. imperialism cannot but arouse great anger from the people of Asia and every peace-loving and just person in the world. The Chinese people resolutely protest against the despicable crime of the United States in conducting nuclear explosions in the Pacific region. We do not allow the United States to conduct nuclear weapon explosions and demand an immediate cessation of all nuclear explosion tests worldwide!

    不许美国进行核武器爆炸
    本报评论员
    据我国科学机关的观察站得到的资料，证明美国帝国主义从今年4月以来，在太平洋公海马绍尔群岛连续进行紧张的核武器爆炸试验，使我国东南沿海等地空气中的放射性微尘沉降剧烈增加。另据东京消息，7月14日在赤道附近海面从事海洋观察工作的日本船“拓洋”号和“萨摩”号已遭受到美国核爆炸试验造成的放射性微尘的灾害，三十七名船员患了威胁生命的白血球减少症。显然，这是美国危害中国人民、日本人民和亚洲各国人民生命安全的又一严重罪行。
    我国科学家指出，美国军事当局不顾全世界人民的反对，故意选定春夏季这个时期在马绍尔群岛进行核爆炸，其用心是极为恶毒的。因为在这段期间，带着放射性物质的季节风，按照大气环流的规律，会更多地从太平洋吹过中国东南沿海、日本和朝鲜，而不会吹到美国自己的领土和领海。由此可见，美国军事当局是蓄意要借此来谋害中国、朝鲜、日本和其他亚洲各国人民，这显然是一种极端卑鄙的罪行。人们可以从这件事情中看出，在美国白宫和五角大楼里掌握大权的那些人，是一小撮多么卑劣的强盗和凶手。
    美国当局为了欺骗各国人民，曾大吹大擂地说，美国在太平洋地区爆炸的是一种“干净”的氢弹，这种无耻的谎言已经被美国自己的罪恶的黑手所干下的勾当完全揭穿了。受到美国的这种“干净”氢弹残害的三十七名日本船员就是血淋淋的见证。
    亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民都不会忘记，美国在1954年在马绍尔群岛的比基尼岛进行的核爆炸试验，就曾对日本人民和亚洲人民造成严重的灾害。日本渔船“福龙丸”五号二十三名船员受到伤害，久保山爱吉并遭惨死。那年日本和中国沿海一带降落的雨雪中含有大量有毒的放射性物质，日本渔民受害很大。美国的这一罪行，曾激怒了世界上每一个有良心的人。自那时以后，各国人民掀起了强大的反对核爆炸试验的运动。但是，美国不顾全世界人民的普遍愿望，不顾苏联为促成普遍停止核爆炸而单方面停止核武器试验的真诚努力，又在太平洋地区连续进行核爆炸试验。据塔斯社发表的苏联科学机关观察站记录的材料，美国在从4月28日到7月26日不到三个月的期间内，就在太平洋地区进行了三十二次核武器爆炸试验。而在1954年，美国从3月1日到4月6日在比基尼进行了三次核爆炸，就造成了那样严重的灾害；这回不但爆炸的次数比那次多了十倍，而且时间持续达三个月之久，因而它对于太平洋地区亚洲各国人民生命安全的威胁必然更为严重。“拓洋”号和“萨摩”号所受到的灾害只不过是已经查明的两个例子而已。
    美国在与英国合伙侵略中东的同时，又在太平洋地区加紧进行核武器爆炸，其目的显然不仅是为了谋害亚洲各国人民，而且也是为了毒化整个国际气氛。美国帝国主义这种穷凶极恶的行为，不能不激起亚洲人民和全世界每一个爱好和平和正义的人民的极大愤怒。中国人民坚决抗议美国在太平洋地区进行核爆炸的卑鄙罪行。我们不许美国进行核武器爆炸，并要求立即在全世界停止一切核爆炸试验！
