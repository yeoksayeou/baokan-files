　　Haining Small Indigenous Blast Furnace Opens Big Red Flower
    More Than Eight Tons of Iron Produced in Five Days and Nights
    According to a report in the Zhejiang Daily, the Haining Power Cooperative Factory in Zhejiang Province has learned and developed the experience of "Shanxi-style" indigenous blast furnaces and built an indigenous blast furnace that produces iron very normally. This blast furnace produces a furnace of iron every hour, averaging more than 3,000 jin of iron per day. Recently, in five days and two hours, this furnace produced a total of 113 furnaces, smelting 16,105 jin of pig iron. This is a red flower opened by the Haining County Party Committee's steel experimental field.
    This indigenous blast furnace with a volume of 1.5 cubic meters was rebuilt according to the style of the Shanxi furnace. The original Shanxi furnace did not have a hot blast stove, so the workers made hot blast pipes out of diesel drums to maintain the furnace temperature by using the furnace's own heat. A charging hopper and bell were also added at the charging point at the top of the furnace to make charging even and reduce gas.
    The reason why this indigenous blast furnace can produce iron normally is mainly the result of the county party committee's vigorous efforts in the "experimental field." From the day the furnace was built, Deputy Secretary Xu of the County Party Committee, as long as he was not in the countryside, would go to the "experimental field" every day. After meetings late into the night, he would rush to the "experimental field" to study and solve the difficulties encountered in building the furnace and smelting iron with the workers. When the problem of iron water freezing occurred during iron smelting, Deputy Secretary Xu convened workers, local experts, and others for "group consultation." For example, on one occasion, they devised a method to install an exhaust pipe at the bottom of the furnace to discharge moisture and maintain the temperature at the bottom of the furnace, ensuring a smooth flow of iron water.
    Under the direct leadership of the County Party Committee, the workers of this indigenous blast furnace were not satisfied with simply ensuring a smooth flow of iron water. They continuously improved the furnace's structure and operating techniques to extend the furnace's life and increase pig iron production. For example, they originally only used 250 refractory bricks to build the furnace belly, and the furnace needed to be dismantled and repaired every five days, which was very uneconomical. Recently, when they overhauled the furnace, they increased the number of refractory bricks used to build the furnace belly to 600. In this way, the life of the furnace can be extended several times. They also added a layer of insulation equipment inside the furnace wall to keep the furnace temperature at a constant level, ensuring that pig iron production increases day by day.

### 海宁小土高炉开放大红花  五昼夜出铁八吨多

　　海宁小土高炉开放大红花
    五昼夜出铁八吨多
    据浙江日报报道　浙江省海宁动力合作工厂学习和发展了“山西式”土高炉的经验，建设了一座出铁十分正常的土高炉。这座高炉每隔一小时出一炉铁，平均每天出铁三千余斤。最近五昼夜零二小时，这座炉共出铁一百十三炉，炼出生铁一万六千一百零五斤。这是海宁县委钢铁试验田开放的一朵红花。
    这座体积一点五立方公尺的土高炉是根据山西炉的样式改建的。山西炉原来没有热风炉，工人们就以柴油桶制成热风管，利用炉子本身的热气保持炉温。并在炉顶加料处增设加料斗和料钟，使加料均匀，煤气减少。
    这座土高炉所以能够正常出铁，主要是县委大力搞“试验田”的结果。从建炉这一天起，县委徐副书记只要不下乡，每天总要到“试验田”去一趟，晚上开会到深更半夜，他还要赶到“试验田”，跟工人们一起研究解决建炉和炼铁中遇到的困难问题。当炼铁中发生铁水冻结的问题时，徐副书记就召集工人、土专家等进行“群医会诊”。例如，有一次他们设法在炉底装置了排气管，使潮气排出，保持炉底温度，保证了铁水畅流。
    这个土高炉的工人，在县委的直接领导下，不满足于一般地做到铁水流畅，他们不断地改进炉子的构造和操作技术，来延长炉子寿命，提高生铁产量。例如，他们原来只用了二百五十块耐火砖砌炉腹，五天就需要把炉子拆修一次，很不合算。最近，他们在检修炉子时，把砌炉腹用的耐火砖增加为六百块。这样，炉子的寿命就可延长几倍。他们还在炉壁内增加一层保温设备，使炉温经常保持一定温度，保证了生铁产量日益提高。
