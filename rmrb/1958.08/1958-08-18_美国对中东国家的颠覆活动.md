The Eisenhower and Dulles clique shamelessly described the U.S. military's invasion of Lebanon as assisting the Lebanese government in maintaining its territorial integrity and political independence, and used the slander of others' "indirect aggression" to cover up the U.S. aggression crimes. But what kind of "political independence" is the U.S. trying to maintain, and where does the "indirect aggression" come from? Historical facts are the best testimony, and it is difficult for the U.S. to make people not look at the facts and believe the lies.

The U.S. ruling group's implementation of the Fourth Point Program in the Middle East, its support for the Baghdad Pact military group, and its waving of the black flag of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" are all old tricks of "aid," "protection," "common security," and "anti-subversive activities," engaging in the despicable act of undermining the rights of independence and freedom of Middle Eastern countries and brutally suppressing national independence movements.

If we go back a little further, we can cite the example of the U.S. subversion of the Iranian Mossadegh government in August 1953. At that time, the Mossadegh government, which implemented the policy of nationalizing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, was not only hostile to Britain but also did not meet the U.S.'s intention to intervene and seize Iranian oil. The U.S. conspiracy to subvert the Mossadegh government was directly commanded by U.S. military officer McClain, who served as the head of the military advisory group in the Iranian gendarmerie, while the U.S. Embassy in Iran and the "Truman Fourth Point Program" agencies were the guiding centers of this coup. The "Fourth Point Program" agency not only used money to buy rebels for assassinations, arson, and provocations, but its leader, Vaughan, directly received orders from the U.S. Ambassador to Iran to take overall leadership of the coup. As a result, the Mossadegh government was overthrown, and U.S. oil monopolies further seized 40% of Iranian oil and used Iran, which later joined the Baghdad Pact, as a base for U.S. aggression in the Middle East.

More recently, U.S. subversive activities have been frequent and extremely rampant.

In April 1957, the overthrow of the Jordanian nationalist regime—the Nabulsi Cabinet—was the result of the U.S. supporting Jordanian reactionary forces to launch a coup. What kind of "indirect aggression" was this? First, the U.S. created economic and political difficulties for the Nabulsi Cabinet by stopping the "Fourth Point Program" "aid" to Jordan. At the same time, U.S. diplomats engaged in activities to buy off right-wing politicians and army officers, and supported right-wing forces in cleansing patriotic army officers, making the army a tool for suppressing patriotic forces. At that time, Jordanian patriotic senior officer General Nawar, unwilling to accept the instructions of the U.S. military attache, launched a coup and was forced to flee to Syria. In addition, the U.S. also directed Israel, Iraq, and other countries to station troops on the Jordanian border to support the right-wing forces' coup. After the Nabulsi Cabinet was overthrown and Hashim came to power, the U.S. announced $10 million in "aid" to the puppet government to "maintain Jordan's political stability," while directing King Hussein and the Hashim Cabinet to intensify the suppression of domestic patriotic and democratic forces. Under U.S. instructions, nationalists in the cabinet and army were purged. Of the forty members of the Jordanian lower house, seventeen were arrested, and more than three thousand other patriots were arrested. These patriots' names were all provided by U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Mallory.

After the U.S. succeeded in subverting the Jordanian nationalist regime, it immediately took advantage of Syria's situation of being surrounded by reactionary forces after the Jordanian coup and turned its subversive edge towards Syria. The U.S. subversive conspiracy case cracked by the Syrian government in August 1957 revealed the U.S.'s conspiracy to organize and buy off reactionaries at the cost of 300 to 400 million U.S. dollars to carry out assassinations and launch coups. According to the Syrian "Al-Nour" newspaper, the U.S. Embassy in Jordan gave Jordanian King Hussein's uncle, Jamil, 500,000 U.S. dollars as expenses for carrying out assassination activities in Syria. Jamil was responsible for training members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan to carry out assassinations, preparing to assassinate Syrian military and political personnel. When this "indirect aggression" failed, the U.S. planned a direct aggression against Syria, sending veteran conspirator Henderson to the Middle East to instigate Turkey and other countries to gather troops on the Syrian border to carry out provocations, and U.S. fleets and aircraft were also mobilized to the Syrian coast in the eastern Mediterranean. Dulles openly clamored to exercise the power of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and invade Syria.

The main goal of all U.S. conspiracy activities in the Middle East is to bring down the nationalist regimes of Egypt and Syria. After Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic in February this year, and then Yemen also formed the United Arab States with the UAR, the U.S. was even more furious and tried every means to remove this thorn in its side. In addition to carrying out divisive, co-optive, and organized assassination conspiracies, the U.S. also planned for the ruling groups of Iraq and Jordan to put together a so-called "Arab Federation" to oppose the UAR. At the same time, the U.S. also tried its best to put together a "Mediterranean Group," attempting to use it as a tool for further expansion in the Middle East and to divide and weaken the UAR. Recently, the Cairo "Al-Ahram" newspaper published a shocking secret telegram seized by Iraqi revolutionaries from the U.S. State Department to its embassy in Baghdad, further exposing the U.S. conspiracy to isolate and subvert the UAR. The secret telegram emphasized: "We must continue unremittingly to discredit the idea of Syria and Egypt establishing a federation in order to alienate the two countries, because our (meaning the U.S.) main goal in this region remains to divide Syria and Egypt." The U.S. believes that: "The disintegration of the United Arab Republic will not only end the fate of Nasser's Egypt, but will also make it easier for us (meaning the U.S.) to repel Arab nationalism."

In the Middle East, as in other regions, what the U.S. wants to maintain is the "political independence" of traitors and all reactionaries who are loyal to the U.S. and betray the people, and it uses indirect aggression and direct aggression against governments that truly maintain national independence and state sovereignty, doing everything possible.

If the U.S. used to wear a hypocritical mask when carrying out various conspiracy activities in the Middle East, then this time, the U.S. openly sent troops to invade Lebanon with a fierce momentum, and attempted to collude with Britain to expand the armed aggression against the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq, thoroughly exposing the true face of U.S. imperialism as the deadly enemy of the people of the Middle East. The sneaky indirect aggression failed to achieve the goal of dominating the Middle East, so it raised the black flag of direct armed aggression; now, when the U.S.'s direct aggression plan has been frustrated, it wants to re-embellish itself and save itself by using the trick of a thief crying "stop thief." There is no such wishful thinking in the world! (Qian Ping)

### 美国对中东国家的颠覆活动

　　美国对中东国家的颠覆活动
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流，厚颜无耻地把美军侵略黎巴嫩说成是协助黎巴嫩政府维护它的领土完整和政治独立，并以诬蔑别人“间接侵略”来掩盖美国的侵略罪行。但美国所要维护的究竟是什么样的“政治独立”，而“间接侵略”又究竟来自何方呢？历史事实是最好的见证人，美国要使人不看事实，而去相信谎言是困难的。
    美国统治集团在中东实行第四点计划，支持巴格达条约军事集团，打出“艾森豪威尔主义”的黑旗，都无一不是挂着“援助”、“保护”、“共同安全”、“反颠覆活动”等老招牌，干着破坏中近东国家独立自由权利，凶恶地镇压民族独立运动的卑鄙勾当。
    如果说得远一些，那末可以举出1953年8月美国颠覆伊朗摩萨台政府的例证。当时执行把英伊石油公司收归国有的政策的摩萨台政府，不仅受到英国的敌视，而且也不合企图插手夺取伊朗石油的美国的心意。美国策动颠覆摩萨台政府的阴谋，是由在伊朗宪兵中充当军事顾问团长的美国军官麦克兰直接指挥的，而美国驻伊朗大使馆和“杜鲁门第四点计划”机构则是这一政变的指导中心。“第四点计划”机构不仅用钱收买叛乱分子进行暗杀、纵火和挑衅活动，它的领导人沃恩直接受命于美国驻伊朗大使，担负了这一政变的总领导。结果，摩萨台政府被推翻了，美国石油垄断集团由此进一步掌握了40％的伊朗石油，还把后来参加巴格达条约的伊朗作为美国侵略中近东的基地。
    说得近一些，美国的颠覆活动更是频繁，其嚣张程度达于极点。
    1957年4月，约旦民族主义政权——纳布西内阁之被推翻，就是美国扶植约旦反动势力发动政变的结果。这是怎样一种“间接侵略”的手法呢？首先，美国以停止“第四点计划”给约旦的“援助”，给纳布西内阁经济上和政治上制造了种种困难。同时，美国外交人员进行了收买右翼政客和陆军军官的活动，并支持右翼势力清洗陆军中的爱国军官，使陆军成为镇压爱国力量的工具。当时约旦爱国高级军官诺瓦尔将军由于不愿接受美国武官的指示，发动政变，而被迫流亡叙利亚。此外，美国还指使以色列、伊拉克等驻兵约旦边境，声援右翼势力的政变。当纳布西内阁被推翻，哈希姆上台以后，美国就一面宣布给傀儡政府一千万美元的“援助”来“维持约旦的政治稳定”；一面又指使侯赛因国王和哈希姆内阁加紧镇压国内的爱国民主力量。在美国的指使下，内阁和军队中的民族主义者被清除了，在约旦下院的四十个议员中，被捕的达十七人之多，其他爱国者被捕的达三千人以上。这些爱国者的名单都是美国驻约旦大使马洛里一手供给的。
    美国颠覆约旦民族主义政权得逞后，立即乘叙利亚在约旦政变后四面受反动势力包围的处境，把颠覆锋芒指向叙利亚。1957年8月叙利亚政府破获的美国颠覆阴谋案，揭发了美国以三、四亿美元的代价，组织和收买反动分子，进行暗杀活动和发动政变的阴谋活动。据叙利亚“光明报”揭露，美国驻约旦大使馆就曾给约旦国王侯赛因的叔父贾米勒五十万美元，作为在叙利亚进行暗杀活动的费用。贾米勒负责对约旦的穆斯林兄弟会会员进行暗杀训练，准备暗杀叙利亚的军政人员。当这种“间接侵略”失败后，美国就策划对叙利亚的直接侵略，派出老牌阴谋家汉德逊去中东唆使土耳其等国在叙利亚边境集结兵力，进行挑衅，美国的舰队和飞机也向东地中海的叙利亚海岸调动，杜勒斯公开叫嚣要行使“艾森豪威尔主义”的权力，侵略叙利亚。
    美国在中近东进行的一切阴谋活动的主要目标，是搞垮埃及和叙利亚的民族主义政权。今年2月埃及和叙利亚组成阿拉伯联合共和国，接着也门也和阿联结成阿拉伯联合邦以后，美国更是恼怒，千方百计企图拔除这个眼中钉。美国除了进行分化、拉拢和组织暗杀阴谋活动以外，策划伊拉克和约旦的统治集团拼凑所谓“阿拉伯联邦”来与阿联对立。与此同时，美国还竭力拼凑“地中海集团”，企图把它作为对中东进一步扩张的工具，并以此来分裂和削弱阿联。最近，开罗“金字塔报”公布了伊拉克革命者所缴获的美国国务院发给它驻巴格达大使馆的一封触目惊心的秘密电报，更进一步暴露了美国策划孤立和颠覆阿联的阴谋。密电强调说：“必须继续不懈地努力使叙利亚和埃及建立联邦的思想信誉扫地，以便离间这两个国家，因为我们（指美国）在这个地区的主要目标仍然是分裂叙利亚和埃及”。美国认为：“阿拉伯联合共和国的瓦解不仅将结束纳赛尔埃及的命运，而且也将使我们（指美国）较容易地击退阿拉伯民族主义”。
    美国在中近东，和在其他地区一样，它所要维护的是忠于美国而背叛人民的卖国贼和一切反动派的
  “政治独立”，而对于真正维护民族独立和国家主权的政府则实行间接侵略和直接侵略，无所不用其极。
    如果说美国过去在中近东进行种种阴谋活动的时候，还戴着伪善的假面具，那末，这一次美国气势凶凶地公开出兵侵略黎巴嫩，并企图伙同英国一起扩大侵略阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国的武装侵略行动，就彻底地暴露了美帝国主义是中近东人民的死敌的真面目。偷偷摸摸的间接侵略勾当未能实现称霸中近东的目的，就祭起直接的武装侵略的黑旗；现在，当美国直接的侵略计划受到挫败后，又想重新粉饰自己，并以贼喊捉贼的手法来挽救自己，天下那有这样如意的算盘！　　　　　　　　　　　　　（倩萍）
