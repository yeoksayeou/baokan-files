　　Where Did the Incense Burner Go?
　　Coming home from work, I stepped into the main room and immediately felt something was missing. I looked carefully; everything was the same, except the copper incense burner and two candlestick holders on the table were gone. I asked my younger brother, who said Mom had just taken them away herself!
　　I was puzzled.
　　For my mother, this was simply unbelievable. In the nine years since liberation, Mom had indeed made rapid progress. In the past, whenever something unpleasant happened, she would mutter incantations: "Great Compassionate Guanyin Bodhisattva," and so on. In recent years, she stopped reciting those. Replacing the image of the Guanyin Mother on the wall was a portrait of Chairman Mao. However, on the first and fifteenth of each lunar month, she had to burn incense, and on the 15th of the 7th month and during the New Year, she insisted on burning paper money. I had tried to dissuade her from this. Mom said, "I don't believe in ghosts and gods anymore, but if I don't burn them at that time, it's like something is left undone…"
　　So, until now, Mom had continued to burn incense and paper money as usual. The candlesticks and incense burner had become her exclusive items.
　　While I was wondering, Mom came in. I asked, and she said, "Now that the whole country is mobilizing to make steel, what's the point of me keeping that stuff!"
　　Ah! Mom was doing it to support steel production. Mom added, "I took the candlesticks, incense burner, and some scrap iron to the street office. Although it's not much, every little bit helps, accumulating small things to make a big difference!"
　　"Does that mean you won't be burning incense anymore!" I couldn't help but laugh, thinking about how superstitious Mom used to be.
　　"If I still wanted to burn incense, I wouldn't have donated it. Life is getting better day by day; why would I need to pray to gods?"
　　As Mom spoke, she picked up a rag and vigorously wiped the table, as if to erase all traces of incense ash from it.

### 香炉哪里去了

　　香炉哪里去了
    下班回家时，刚一跨进堂屋，就觉这里少了什么，仔细看看，一切依旧，只是案桌上的铜香炉和两个蜡烛台不见了。一问弟弟说是妈自己刚拿走！
    我迷惑了。
    因为这对妈妈来说，简直是不可思议的事。解放后九年多，妈妈确实进步很快。过去一碰到不顺心的事，口中就念念有词：什么大慈大悲观世音菩萨等等。这几年，是不见念了。代替墙上观音老母像的是毛主席的像。可是每逢初一、十五得烧几根香，7月15、过年一定要烧些纸。为这我曾劝阻过妈妈。妈说：“我现在也不信神鬼了，只是到时候不烧就像有件事情未了……。”
    所以直到现在妈妈一直照例烧香烧纸。蜡烛台和香炉便成了妈妈的专用品了。
    正疑惑间，妈进来了。我一问，她就说：“这回全国都动手炼钢，我还留着那个干啥！”
    啊！妈原来是为了支援炼钢。妈又说：“我把烛台香炉和一点废铁送到街道办事处去了。虽说不多，可是拣芝麻凑斗，积少成多嘛！”
    “往后你就不能烧香了啊！”一想起妈妈那样迷信就不禁笑起来。
    “要还想烧香就不往外献了。日子一天天好，还用得着求神呀？”
    妈一面说着，一面拿起抹布用力擦着案桌，似乎要把案桌上的香灰印迹也一齐擦掉。
