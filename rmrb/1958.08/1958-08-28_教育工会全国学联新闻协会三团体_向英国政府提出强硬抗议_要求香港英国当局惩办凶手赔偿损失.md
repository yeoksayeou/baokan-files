Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. The National Committee of the Chinese Education Union, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Journalists Association, this afternoon sent representatives to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China to strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of the Chinese Middle School and the beating of teachers, students, and Chinese journalists present.

Fang Ming, Vice Chairman of the Education Union, Hu Qili, Chairman of the Student Federation, and Lu Minggu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Journalists Association, respectively handed over three strong protest letters from the three organizations to representatives of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, and asked them to immediately forward them to the British government. The representatives of the three organizations righteously and sternly condemned the unreasonable behavior of the Hong Kong British authorities to the representatives of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities punish the murderers, compensate for all the losses suffered by the teachers and students of the Chinese Middle School and the Chinese journalists, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future.

Reporters from Xinhua News Agency, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and other Beijing newspapers accompanied the representatives of the Journalists Association to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office to protest.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. The National Committee of the Chinese Education Union today handed over a letter of protest to the British government to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China, expressing its angry protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' brutal closure of the Chinese Middle School and the beating of teachers, students, and Chinese journalists.

The protest letter stated: "The Hong Kong British authorities have consistently and wantonly undermined the educational undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and recently they have become even more frantic. The incident on the 6th of this month, in which Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School in Hong Kong, was forcibly deported, is a blatant example of this persecution activity by the Hong Kong British authorities, which has aroused the angry protests of the Chinese education community and the broad masses of students. However, the Hong Kong British authorities not only did not stop this persecution, but intensified it, and on the 26th of this month, under the pretext of 'dangerous school buildings', forcibly closed the Chinese Middle School and expelled and beat teachers, students, and journalists present. It is reported that as early as the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong British authorities implemented the so-called 'Revised Education Ordinance', interfering with schools hanging our national flag, stipulating that schools use the reactionary textbooks of the Chiang Kai-shek group, and interfering with Chinese schools conducting patriotic education for students. These facts fully prove that the persecution of the educational undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon by the Hong Kong British authorities is planned."

The protest letter continued: "The National Committee of the Chinese Education Union, on behalf of more than 2.4 million educators in China, lodges a serious protest to the Hong Kong British authorities. We resolutely demand that the Hong Kong British authorities punish the murderers, compensate for all the losses suffered by the teachers and students of the Chinese Middle School and the Chinese journalists, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future."

The protest letter concluded: "The Hong Kong British authorities' series of actions to persecute the educational undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon is a concrete manifestation of hostility towards New China and the Chinese people. The Chinese people have not forgotten that the Hong Kong British authorities have consistently sheltered the Chiang Kai-shek group, using Hong Kong as a base to carry out armed harassment and espionage sabotage activities against the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have not forgotten that the Hong Kong British authorities are actively engaged in activities to create 'two Chinas'. We solemnly warn the Hong Kong British authorities that if this behavior of hostility towards New China and hostility towards the Chinese people is not stopped immediately, the Hong Kong British authorities must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of these behaviors."

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. The All-China Students' Federation today handed over a letter of protest to the British government to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China, lodging a strong protest and serious warning against the Hong Kong British authorities' brutal closure of the Chinese Middle School and the beating of teachers, students, and Chinese journalists.

The protest letter stated: "The incident of the Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of the Chinese Middle School is by no means accidental. The Hong Kong British authorities have consistently and rudely violated the sacred right of Chinese students in Hong Kong to love their motherland, unreasonably interfering with Chinese schools in Hong Kong hanging the national flag and singing the national anthem; but they allow schools run by American and Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong to hang the flags of the Chiang Kai-shek group every day. They also force schools to use reactionary textbooks published by the Chiang Kai-shek group. Recently, the Hong Kong British authorities even unreasonably deported Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School. This series of incidents shows that the Hong Kong British authorities are deliberately undermining the educational undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong. Not only that, the Hong Kong British authorities have consistently protected the Chiang Kai-shek group's special agent organizations, the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, using Hong Kong as a base to carry out conspiracy and sabotage activities against New China. We have not forgotten the serious crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in condoning Kuomintang agents and rioters to murder and rob our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon during the Kowloon riots two years ago. All these facts thoroughly expose the British government's face of hostility towards the Chinese people and creating 'two Chinas'."

The protest letter emphasized: "We seriously warn the British government: it must immediately stop undermining the educational undertakings of the Chinese people in Hong Kong; immediately and reasonably resolve the issue of the Chinese Middle School's school building, so that the school can open as scheduled; severely punish all those responsible; compensate for all the losses of the Chinese Middle School; and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. If the Hong Kong British authorities insist on going their own way and continue to disregard the Chinese people's solemn warning, then they must bear all the consequences arising therefrom."

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. The All-China Journalists Association today handed over a letter of protest to the British government to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China, protesting the Hong Kong British authorities' brutal treatment of Chinese journalists.

The protest letter stated that journalists across China feel extremely indignant at the Hong Kong British authorities' barbaric behavior of persecuting Chinese journalists in Hong Kong and being hostile to the news undertakings of the Chinese people. The All-China Journalists Association believes that this atrocity by the Hong Kong British authorities not only violates human rights and undermines freedom of the press, but also further proves that the Hong Kong British authorities have adopted a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. In order to protect the personal safety of Chinese journalists in Hong Kong and safeguard their freedom of interview rights, the All-China Journalists Association, in addition to lodging the most serious protest, demands that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the murderers, compensate for the losses of the persecuted Chinese journalists, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future.

    教育工会全国学联新闻协会三团体
    向英国政府提出强硬抗议
    要求香港英国当局惩办凶手赔偿损失
    新华社27日讯　中国教育工会全国委员会、中华全国学生联合会和中华全国新闻工作者协会，今天下午分别派代表到英国驻中国代办处，强烈抗议香港英国当局强行封闭中华中学校舍并且殴伤这个学校的师生和在场中国新闻记者的暴行。
    教育工会副主席方明，学联主席胡启立和新闻工作者协会副秘书长卢鸣谷等人，分别将三团体的三份强硬的抗议书递交给英国代办处的代表，并且要他们立即负责转告英国政府。三团体的代表当场向英国代办处代表义正辞严地谴责香港英国当局的无理行为，要香港英国当局惩办凶首，赔偿中华中学师生和中国新闻记者的一切损失，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    同新闻工作者协会代表一起去英国代办处抗议的，还有新华社、大公报、文汇报和北京其他报纸的记者。
    新华社27日讯　中国教育工会全国委员会今天把一份对英国政府的抗议书递交给英国驻中国代办处，对香港英国当局武力封闭中华中学校舍，殴打教师、学生和中国记者的暴行表示愤怒抗议。
    抗议书说：“香港英国当局对港九中国人民的教育事业一贯横加摧残，最近是更加疯狂了。本月6日发生的强迫递解香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎出境的事件，是香港英国当局这种迫害活动的一个彰明昭著的事例，引起了中国教育界和广大学生群众的愤怒抗议。但是，香港英国当局不但不停止这种迫害，反而变本加厉，又于本月26日以‘校舍危险’为借口，武力封闭中华中学校舍，并且驱逐、殴打教师、学生和在场采访的记者。据悉早在今年年初，香港英国当局就施行所谓‘修正教育条例’，干涉学校悬挂我国国旗，规定学校使用蒋介石集团的反动课本，干涉中国学校向学生进行爱国主义教育。这些事实完全证明香港英国当局对港九中国人民教育事业的迫害是有计划地进行的。”
    抗议书接着说：“中国教育工会全国委员会代表中国二百四十多万教育工作者向香港英国当局提出严重抗议。我们坚决要求香港英国当局惩办凶首、赔偿中华中学师生和中国记者所受的一切损失，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件。”
    抗议书最后说：“香港英国当局迫害港九中国人民教育事业的一系列行动，是敌视新中国、敌视中国人民的一种具体表现。中国人民没有忘记，香港英国当局一贯包庇蒋介石集团以香港为基地对中华人民共和国进行武装骚扰和间谍破坏活动。中国人民也没有忘记，香港英国当局积极地进行制造‘两个中国’的活动。我们严正地警告香港英国当局，如果这种敌视新中国、敌视中国人民的行为不立即停止，香港英国当局必须对这些行为的一切后果，担负全部责任。”
    新华社27日讯　中华全国学生联合会，今天把一份对英国政府的抗议书递交给英国驻中国代办处，对香港英国当局武力封闭中华中学校舍、殴打该校师生和中国记者的暴行，提出强烈抗议和严重警告。
    抗议书说：“香港英国当局武力封闭中华中学校舍的事件绝不是偶然的。香港英国当局一贯粗暴地侵犯香港中国学生热爱祖国的神圣权利，无理干涉香港的中国学校挂国旗、唱国歌；却容许香港美、蒋特务分子主办的学校天天悬挂蒋介石集团的旗帜。并且还迫令各学校使用蒋介石集团出版的反动课本。最近，香港英国当局更无理地将培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境。这一系列事件说明了香港英国当局蓄意摧残香港中国人民的教育事业。不仅如此，香港英国当局还一贯庇护中国人民的死敌蒋介石集团特务组织以香港为基地对新中国进行阴谋破坏活动。我们没有忘记，二年以前的九龙暴乱中，香港英国当局纵容国民党特务、暴徒杀害、抢劫我港九同胞的严重罪行。所有这些事实都彻底地暴露了英国政府敌视中国人民、制造‘两个中国’的面目。”
    抗议书强调指出：“我们严重警告英国政府：必须立即停止对香港中国人民教育事业的摧残；立即合理解决中华中学的校舍问题，使该校如期开学；严惩一切肇事人员；赔偿中华中学的全部损失；保证不再发生类似事件。如果香港英国当局一意孤行，继续无视中国人民的严正警告，那么，它就必须承担由此而引起的一切后果。”
    新华社27日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会今天把一份对英国政府的抗议书递交给英国驻中国代办处，抗议香港英国当局殴辱中国新闻记者的暴行。
    抗议书说，全中国的新闻工作者，对香港英国当局迫害香港中国记者、敌视中国人民的新闻事业的野蛮行为，感到无比的愤慨。中华全国新闻工作者协会认为香港英国当局的这一暴行，不仅侵犯了人权，破坏了新闻自由，并且也进一步证明了香港英国当局采取敌视中国人民的政策。中华全国新闻工作者协会为保卫香港中国记者的人身安全、维护他们采访的自由权利，除了提出最严重的抗议以外，并要求香港英国当局严惩凶手，赔偿受迫害的中国记者的损失，保证以后不再发生类似事件。（附图片）
