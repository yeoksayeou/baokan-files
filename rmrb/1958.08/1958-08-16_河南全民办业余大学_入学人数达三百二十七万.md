Henan Province Runs Amateur Universities for All People
　　Enrollment Reaches 3,270,000
    (Reported by our correspondent Chen Jian) The main characteristic of the current cultural revolution upsurge in Henan Province is that all the people are running universities. At present, the masses have established more than 17,000 amateur, part-time, work-study universities on their own, with an enrollment of 3,270,000, most of whom are young and middle-aged people who have graduated from literacy classes.
    The characteristics of the Henan-run amateur universities are the implementation of the communist education policy of serving politics, combining education with production; school teaching combines cadres, intellectuals, and old peasants. This combination is the best way for grassroots cadres to become both red and expert, for intellectuals to carry out ideological transformation, and to summarize the production experience of old peasants; it has created a method of unified learning of politics, culture, and technology; combining education and leading organs; and combining educational organizations and production organizations.
    Judging from the amateur universities established in various parts of Henan, most are similar to Zhaiquan Agricultural University, but each has its own characteristics. These schools generally have departments and specialties. The school stipulates that politics and culture are compulsory subjects for each student, and students choose one or several technical courses according to their personal interests and specialties. In each department of these universities, Party member cadres participate in leadership and study, and are equipped with intellectuals and experienced old peasants and production models to jointly organize the study of political, cultural, and technical courses. At the same time, schools in various places also set up different departments and specialties according to local production conditions and the specific conditions of their townships and communities. For example, Wencun Township in Dengfeng County has established eleven colleges: the Water Conservancy College specializes in soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction, and the Women's College specializes in field management, thrift and housekeeping, maternal and child health, etc. Lu, the enterprise with the highest concentration of handicrafts and semi-mechanized industries in Shangqiu City, has established a technical university. All workers, workers' families and residents on this street are enrolled. Students work in factories and other industries during the day, and study technology at night according to the nature of their work.
    The teachers (transferred cadres, township and commune Party secretaries, intellectuals in the countryside, old peasants) and students of these folk universities do not leave production. They are professors and students in the classroom at night, and ordinary laborers in the fields or in the factory during the day. They take the scientific principles they have learned to the fields and factories for experimentation.
    Folk universities have become the best form of technical revolution and cultural revolution in Henan Province. It not only organizes all existing cultural, scientific and technological forces to serve production, but also rapidly improves the cultural and scientific and technological level of all people through the learning method of combining theory with practice.
    These more than 17,000 folk universities have now all started classes, and some schools have received remarkable results. Recently, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of the heads of cultural and educational departments of the prefectural and municipal committees at Zhaiquan Agricultural University, pointing out three ways to continue to consolidate the folk universities: (1) It is necessary to establish strong Party leadership in all folk universities, and each department must have a certain amount of Party leadership to ensure the realization of the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants; (2) Resolutely implement the Party's policy of education serving production and politics; (3) Grasp the struggle between the two roads and the two methods.

### 河南全民办业余大学　入学人数达三百二十七万

　　河南全民办业余大学
　　入学人数达三百二十七万
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省当前文化革命高潮的主要特征是全民办大学。目前群众已自办业余的半耕半读的大学一万七千多所，入学人数达到三百二十七万，大部分是扫盲毕业的青壮年。
    河南民办业余大学的特点，是贯彻了教育为政治服务、教育和生产相结合的共产主义教育方针；学校教学使干部、知识分子和老农相结合，这种结合是基层干部达到又红又专、知识分子进行思想改造和总结老农生产经验的最好形式；创造了政治、文化、技术统一学习的方法；教育和领导机关相结合；教育组织和生产组织相结合。
    从河南各地创办的业余大学来看，大部分类似翟泉农业大学，但也各有特点。这类学校一般分科分系，学校规定政治、文化为每个学员的必修科，学生根据个人爱好和特长各选一门到若干门技术课。这些大学的每个科系都有党员干部参加领导和学习，并配备有知识分子和有生产经验的老农和生产模范，共同组织政治、文化、技术课的学习。同时，各地学校还根据当地生产条件和本乡本社的具体情况，设置不同系科。例如登封县文村乡创办了十一个学院：水利学院专门学习水土保持和水利建设，妇女学院专门学习田间管理、勤俭持家、妇幼卫生等。商丘市手工业和半机械工业最集中的企业路，创办了一所技术大学。这条街的所有工人、工人家属和居民全部入学。学生白天在工厂和其他行业劳动生产，晚上根据自己的业务性质学习技术。
    这些民办大学的教员（下放干部，乡、社党委书记，在乡知识分子，老农）和学生都不脱离生产，他们晚上在教室里是教授和学生，白天在田间或在工厂是普通的劳动者。他们学到的科学原理，就带到田间和工厂去试验。
    民办大学成为河南省进行技术革命和文化革命的最好形式。它不仅把现有一切文化科学技术力量组织起来，为生产服务，而且通过理论联系实际的学习方法，将迅速提高全民的文化水平和科学技术水平。
    这一万七千多所民办大学现在已全部开课，有些学校已经收到显著的成绩。最近，中共河南省委在翟泉农业大学召开了地委市委文教部长会议，指出继续巩固民办大学的三项办法：（一）必须在各民办大学中树立党的坚强领导，各科各系必须有一定的党的领导力量，保证实现知识分子和工农结合；（二）坚决贯彻执行党的教育为生产为政治服务的方针政策；（三）抓住两条道路和两种方法的斗争。（附图片）
