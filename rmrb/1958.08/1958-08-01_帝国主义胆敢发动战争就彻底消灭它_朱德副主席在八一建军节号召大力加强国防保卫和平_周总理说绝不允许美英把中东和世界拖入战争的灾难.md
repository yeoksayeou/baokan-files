    If Imperialism Dares to Launch a War, Thoroughly Eliminate It
    Vice Chairman Zhu De Calls for Vigorously Strengthening National Defense to Safeguard Peace on the August 1st Army Day
    Premier Zhou Enlai Says Absolutely No Permission for the US and UK to Drag the Middle East and the World into a War Disaster

    (Reported by this newspaper) Vice Chairman Zhu De pointed out today: "Imperialism still has not abandoned its plans to create new wars." He warned the imperialist aggressors, saying: If imperialism dares to launch a war, it will be thoroughly eliminated. He mentioned this in an article written to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The title of this article is "People's Army, People's War." (Full text to be published separately)

    The article sternly condemned the US and UK's plans to create new wars. It pointed out: "US imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and is still surrounding us with a series of military bases in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. US and UK imperialism are carrying out military adventures in the Middle East, armed intervention in the Arab people's struggle for liberation, and the peace of the Middle East and the world is being seriously threatened." The article continued: "The people of the world must heighten their vigilance, thwart the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, and be prepared to thoroughly crush the aggressors' offensive when imperialism dares to launch a war, and thoroughly eliminate the creators of war - the imperialist system."

    Vice Chairman Zhu spoke about the tasks of the Chinese people under the new situation, saying: "Under these circumstances, vigorously strengthening our national defense, strengthening our forces for defending the motherland and safeguarding peace, is the urgent task of our entire Party, our entire army, and all our people. Let us unite under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and strive to build the People's Liberation Army into an excellent and modern revolutionary army including a strong army, a strong air force, and a strong navy in the shortest possible time."

    Xinhua News Agency, July 31st - Premier Zhou Enlai said today that the Asian, African, and peace-loving countries and people of the world absolutely cannot allow the US and British governments to drag West Asia and the world into a serious war disaster.

    Premier Zhou Enlai said this at a reception held at noon today by Yang Ann, head of the Cambodian economic delegation to China, to celebrate the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. Premier Zhou said: "Although the colonialists have always held a deeply resentful attitude towards the upsurge of national independence and friendly unity among the people of Asia and Africa, and have taken various measures to obstruct and undermine it, they absolutely cannot resist the advance of the historical trend."

    Premier Zhou said: "Now, the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan, as well as the threat of force against the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic, have been strongly opposed and justly condemned by all peace-loving countries and people in Asia, Africa, and the world. If the US and British governments disregard the world's fair opinion, resolutely refuse to abandon their adventurous plans to expand aggression in West Asia, refuse to withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and continue to obstruct and delay the five-nation summit proposed by the Soviet Union aimed at stopping aggression and maintaining peace, then it fully exposes that they are deliberately trying to drag West Asia and the world into a serious war disaster, which is absolutely intolerable to the peace-loving countries and people of Asia, Africa, and the world."

    Premier Zhou emphasized: "Today, the people of Asia and Africa have stood up, and the tide of national independence in Asia and Africa is unstoppable. The final victory must belong to the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and the world."

    Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was warmly welcomed by more than three hundred Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception. As soon as he finished speaking, the venue erupted in sustained applause.

    帝国主义胆敢发动战争就彻底消灭它
    朱德副主席在八一建军节号召大力加强国防保卫和平
    周总理说绝不允许美英把中东和世界拖入战争的灾难
    本报讯　朱德副主席今天指出：“帝国主义仍然没有放弃制造新战争的计划。”他警告帝国主义侵略者说：帝国主义胆敢发动战争，就把它彻底消灭。这是他在为纪念中国人民解放军建军三十一周年写的一篇文章中提到的。这篇文章的题目是“人民军队、人民战争”。（全文另发）
    这篇文章严厉地谴责了美英制造新战争的计划。它指出：“美帝国主义还在霸占着我国领土台湾，还在南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾用一系列的军事基地包围着我们。美英帝国主义正在中东进行军事冒险，武装干涉阿拉伯人民的解放斗争，中东和世界的和平正在受到严重的威胁。”文章接着说：“全世界的人民必须提高警惕，击破帝国主义侵略者的战争阴谋，并且准备在帝国主义胆敢发动战争的时候彻底粉碎侵略者的进攻，彻底消灭战争的制造者——帝国主义制度。”
    朱副主席谈到了新形势下中国人民的任务，他说：“在这种情况下，大力加强我们的国防，加强我们保卫祖国、保卫和平的力量，是我们全党、全军、全民的迫切任务。让我们团结在党中央的领导下，为在最短时间内把人民解放军建成为包括强大的陆军、强大的空军、强大的海军的一支优良的、现代化的革命军队而奋斗。”
    新华社31日讯　周恩来总理今天说，亚非和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民绝对不能容许美、英政府把西亚和世界拖入一次严重的战争灾难。
    周恩来总理是今天中午在柬埔寨驻中国经济代表团团长杨安为庆祝中柬两国建交举行的招待会上说的。周总理说：“尽管殖民主义者对于在亚非人民中间所涌起的民族独立和友好团结的热潮，始终抱着深恶痛绝的态度，并且采取种种方式进行阻挠和破坏，但是，他们绝对抵挡不住历史潮流的前进。”
    周总理说：“现在，美、英两国对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略以及对伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的武力威胁，已经遭到了亚非和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的强烈反对和正义谴责。如果美、英政府不顾世界的公正舆论，坚决不放弃它们在西亚扩大侵略的冒险计划，拒绝从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出侵略军队，并且对于苏联所倡议的旨在制止侵略、维护和平的五国首脑会议继续抱着阻挠和拖延的态度，那就充分地暴露它们是蓄意要把西亚和世界拖入一次严重的战争灾难，而这是亚非和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民所绝对不能容许的。”
    周总理强调指出：“今天，亚非人民已经站起来了，亚非民族独立的潮流是不可阻挡的。最后的胜利一定属于亚非和全世界一切爱好和平的人民。”
    周恩来总理讲的话，受到了出席招待会的三百多位中外人士的热烈欢迎，他的话音未了，会场上就响起了持久不息的掌声。
