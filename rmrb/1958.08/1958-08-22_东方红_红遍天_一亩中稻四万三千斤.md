　　东方红  红遍天
    一亩中稻四万三千斤
    本报芜湖21日电  安徽省繁昌县峨山乡东方红三社中稻放出一颗惊人的大卫星，在一亩零三厘的田里共收干稻四万四千三百六十七斤十三两，平均亩产四万三千零七十五斤九两，创造了全国水稻亩产的新纪录。
    这块高产田是由这个农业社党支部书记潘德昌，副书记鲁世贵，社主任徐法满、刘家诰，副主任李用启，妇女主任董志云，技术员郑位中，柯冲队生产队长朱长贵和地委农村工作部工作组程行易、项荣年等同志，在柯冲队社员的大力协助下培植出来的。收割时，由全社组成的三百四十八人的收割大队，用三十二张戽桶，从8月17日下午十一时开始收割，直至18日下午七时半才告结束。在边割边掼边运边秤的过程中，所有稻谷经一天半时间的晒场，19日下午在省、地、县各级机关干部的协助下，又重新复秤，最后得出上述干稻实产数字。这块田收割前后经过反复认真的丈量。中共安徽省委农村工作部部长张世荣和芜湖地委副书记王成信同志，在收割的当天下午就到田中观察，并在场参加监打、监收，此外还有省粮食厅副厅长丁之，省委宣传部报刊文艺处处长祁超，芜湖专署副专员张伯言，繁昌县县长耿田等。
    这块田高产的主要措施是选用中农四号良种，选种时整整花了八十个工。全部经过盐酸升汞浸种培育壮秧。深耕一尺二寸，四犁四耙。栽插很密，几乎分不出株行距。共施塘泥四千担，还施了大量菜饼、骨粉、颗粒肥等作基肥，并认真进行了田间管理。
