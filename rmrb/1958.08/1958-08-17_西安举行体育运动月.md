　  Xi'an Holds Sports Movement Month

    (By Our Correspondent) The Xi'an City National Sports Movement Month officially began on the 11th.

    On this day, a sports craze swept through the city, making the ancient city appear even younger. More than 10,000 people participated in a radio mobilization meeting, and 300,000 people were organized to listen. Before the meeting, sports teams composed of various factories and schools carried out publicity on the streets and alleys with gongs and drums and songs everywhere. The publicity adopted various forms, including crosstalk, clapper talk, and living newspapers, as well as image performances of ball games and track and field, and practical performances of apparatus exercises. Workers, students, residents, and suburban farmers throughout the city were all involved in this climax.

    In order to welcome the Movement Month, Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering has made another leap forward. By the 10th, in the entire college, in addition to Level 1 maintaining 100%, Level 2 had increased to 74.6%, and athlete ratings reached 98.9%. All residents of the Beilin District proposed to the city: "Everyone goes to the playground, everyone exercises, everyone is active, and there are competitions every day. If you don't understand, debate; if you don't understand, watch; if you watch, learn; if you learn, do."

    Zhang Fengbo, Deputy Mayor of Xi'an, called on the people of the city at the conference to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, actively exercise, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's call to "develop sports and enhance the people's physique" and to work hard for two years to change the face of Xi'an sports, and strive to achieve the top six in the National Games next year.

　  西安举行体育运动月
    本报讯　西安市全民体育运动月于11日正式开始。
    这一天全城掀起了体育高潮，古老的城市显得越发年轻。一万多人参加了广播动员大会，三十万人组织了收听。会前由各工厂学校组成了体育队伍在大街小巷锣鼓喧天歌声遍地展开了宣传。宣传采用了多种形式，有相声、快板、活报，也有球类、田径的形象表演和器械操的实际表演。全市工人、学生、居民和郊区农民都卷入了这个高潮。
    为了迎接运动月，西安建筑工程学院又来了个跃进，到10日全院劳卫制除一级仍100％外，二级提高到74.6％，等级运动员达98.9％。碑林区全体居民向全市倡议：“人人上操场，个个都锻炼，天天都活动，日日有竞赛。不通就辩，不懂就看，看了就学，学了就做。”
    西安市副市长张锋伯在大会上号召全市人民破除迷信，解放思想，积极锻炼，为实现毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的号召和为西安市苦战两年改变西安体育面貌，力争在明年全国运动会上取得前六名而努力。　　　　（伯杰）
