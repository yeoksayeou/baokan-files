    Linchuan County Party Committee Runs Broadcast Party School
    In July, the Linchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party opened a broadcast party school.
    In order to consolidate the results of the rectification campaign, the rural party grassroots organizations of Linchuan County have opened 58 township party branch schools and 112 commune party branch schools throughout the county. The broadcast party school run by the County Party Committee can strengthen the leadership and guidance of these branch schools. Moreover, through the broadcast party school, all party members in the county can hear the lectures of the responsible comrades of the County Party Committee at the same time.

    临川县委办广播党校
    中共江西临川县委于7月开办了一所广播党校。
    临川县农村党的基层组织，为了巩固整风成果，全县开办了五十八个乡支部学校和一百一十二个社支部学校。县委办广播党校，可以加强对这些支部学校的领导和辅导。而且通过广播党校，可以使全县党员，在同一时候听到县委负责同志的讲课。
