Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 11th: It was previously reported in the newspapers that on August 5th, Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and French Prime Minister de Gaulle regarding the issue of U.S. and British armed intervention in the Near and Middle East.

A reply from Macmillan was received on August 7th.

On August 10th, Khrushchev replied to Macmillan. The full text of the reply is as follows:

To His Excellency Prime Minister Macmillan of Great Britain:

Prime Minister,

I have received your letter of August 7th, in which you state that the British government agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. Prime Minister, I might have stopped there, had it not been necessary to respond to the two arguments you raised in your letter.

You wrote that in my letter of July 23rd, I said that the Soviet government agrees to hold a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government. Indeed, that is so. In your letter of July 22nd, you advocated holding a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council to discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East. After receiving your letter, we expressed our willingness to participate in this meeting.

However, I would like to draw your attention, Prime Minister, to the main point – the essence of the issue. You know that in my initial letter of July 19th to you, Mr. Eisenhower, Mr. de Gaulle, and Mr. Nehru, I proposed convening a summit meeting of the Soviet, British, American, French, and Indian heads of government, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General, to take urgent measures to halt the military conflict in the Near East.

We were then, and remain now, deeply convinced that if these important issues were studied with a serious attitude, then a summit meeting composed as we suggested would be able to resolve the conflict that has occurred most quickly and effectively for the sake of universal peace.

We suggested convening this meeting of the heads of government of the major powers because their consensus would demonstrate that the governments of the major powers can address extremely significant international issues with a pragmatic attitude. Our greatest hope is precisely that everyone can demonstrate such an attitude. The Soviet government believes that the aforementioned summit meeting of countries is of great significance because these countries are extremely powerful, and their attitudes will largely determine the direction in which events develop – towards peace or towards war. We believe that the leaders of all the aforementioned countries will wisely understand the nature of the current situation and its direction of development, as well as the consequences that war would produce, and the endless disasters it would bring to humanity, should it break out.

However, regrettably, our expectations have not been realized. While Indian Prime Minister Nehru and French Prime Minister de Gaulle accepted our proposal to convene a five-nation summit meeting with the participation of the UN Secretary-General, the U.S. President rejected this meeting, and you, in effect, supported him in this regard.

When the five-nation summit meeting proposed by the Soviet government could not be convened through no fault of our own, the Soviet government actively supported your proposal to hold a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council to discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East. In this regard, we referred only to a five-nation summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council, and not to any other meeting.

Furthermore, in your letter of July 22nd, you emphasized that the British government believes that no resolutions should be put forward at this special meeting of the Security Council without prior consultation. In other words, you believed that the aim was to reach a fruitful agreement, rather than to use voting to solidify disagreements. This means that the main talks on the Near and Middle East situation should be conducted among the heads of government of the five nations, with the participation of Mr. Hammarskjöld.

However, in your letter of July 26th, you merely mentioned the heads of government attending the Security Council meeting, and in your letter of July 31st, you only hinted at the possibility of arranging an informal meeting of heads of government to discuss the issues being discussed in the Security Council.

From the successive letters and explanations of the U.S. government, especially from Eisenhower's letter of July 25th, it is quite clear that what is referred to here is merely convening a general regular meeting of the Security Council to discuss the Near and Middle East situation. The Security Council, due to its current composition, has various negative aspects and shortcomings, which I already discussed in my letter of August 5th, and there is no need to discuss them again now. And you, Prime Minister, essentially agree with this proposal of the U.S. President.

Moreover, after Mr. Dulles held a press conference on July 31st, it became very clear that the U.S. government – and the British government, echoing the U.S. government – decided to use this meeting of the Security Council to justify the U.S. and British aggression in the Near and Middle East, and to shift the responsibility for the dangerous situation in the Near and Middle East caused by the U.S. and British armed intervention to other countries, using the non-existent so-called threat of "indirect aggression." From this, it can be seen that at the Security Council meeting proposed by the U.S. and British governments, the heads of government of various countries cannot seriously discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East, and will only waste time in vain, because there is no reason to believe that, under the current composition of the Security Council, this body of the United Nations can guarantee a correct solution to this issue in the interest of peace, as the people of all countries demand.

Thus, the U.S., while being forced to accept this proposal, undoubtedly wants to drag us into a labyrinth of fruitless debate with British support. In this situation, we have come to the conclusion that in order to take the necessary measures to stop the aggression as quickly as possible, an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly should be convened, rather than the Security Council.

At the same time, we also believe that the United Nations General Assembly is the most representative body of this international organization. Participating in the General Assembly are not only representatives of countries that have joined the U.S.-dominated military aggression bloc, but also representatives of other countries – socialist countries and countries that do not participate in any bloc. As for the Arab countries that have suffered direct or indirect aggression from the countries of the aforementioned military bloc, they will also attend the General Assembly, and I do not need to say more about that. It is very clear that the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that has already opened can allow all countries, large and small, to state their positions in this regard, and to seek solutions that help restore peace in the Near and Middle East region and guarantee the security of this region. The Soviet government has appointed the Soviet Foreign Minister to lead a delegation to participate in the General Assembly.

As for the fact that in my letter of August 5th, I mentioned in one place that it is necessary to re-examine the holding of a summit meeting in the composition we originally proposed in order to discuss a wide range of pressing international issues, you evaded the essence of the issue by claiming that your letter of July 1 concerning the convening of a high-level meeting was not answered. Of course, we will not fail to answer your letter. However, it must not be forgotten that when we were negotiating on the convening of a summit meeting to ease international tensions, Britain and the United States carried out armed intervention in the Near East. This action brought the world to the brink of world war. Of course, in this situation, the primary task is to stop the aggression and maintain peace in this region of the world. With this in mind, the Soviet government proposed at that time that a five-nation summit meeting of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, and India, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General, be convened immediately to discuss the situation created in the Near and Middle East due to the armed intervention of the United States and Britain.

Prime Minister, we hope that the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that has already begun can resolve the tasks it faces, thereby greatly clearing the way for convening a meeting of leaders of Eastern and Western countries, the urgency of convening such a meeting has become increasingly clear due to the recent events in the Near and Middle East.

With best regards,

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　N. Khrushchev

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, London: British Prime Minister Macmillan wrote a short reply on August 7th, responding to Khrushchev's letter of August 5th regarding the proposal to convene an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. and British intervention troops from the Middle East.

In his letter, Macmillan stated on the one hand that he "can accept" the Soviet government's proposal to convene an emergency session of the UN General Assembly, but on the other hand, he once again peddled the plan of the U.S. and Britain to deliberately bury the holding of a highest-level meeting by holding a Security Council meeting. He insisted that holding a Security Council meeting, which is practically paralyzed and can only act according to the will of the United States, can make "greater progress" on the Middle East issue.

At the end of his reply, Macmillan talked about the issue of holding an East-West high-level meeting that the Soviet Union had proposed long ago. He did not put forward any specific opinions in this regard, but only expressed the hope that such a meeting could be held "on terms acceptable to everyone."

### 赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的复信全文

　　赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的复信全文
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：报纸前已报道，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫8月5日曾就美英武装干涉中近东问题写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理戴高乐。
    8月7日收到了麦克米伦的复信。
    8月10日赫鲁晓夫复信给麦克米伦，复信全文如下。英国首相麦克米伦先生阁下首相先生：
    我已经收到您8月7日的信件，您在信中说，英国政府同意苏联政府关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议。首相先生，如果不是有必要答复您在信中提出的两个论点，我也许就说到这里为止。
    您写道，我在7月23日的信中说，苏联政府同意举行有各国政府首脑参加的安全理事会特别会议。不错，是这样，您在7月22日的信中主张在安全理事会的范围内举行政府首脑会议讨论中近东局势问题，在收到您的信之后，我们曾表示愿意参加这次会议。
    然而，我想提请您，首相先生注意主要的东西——问题的实质。您知道，我在7月19日写给您、艾森豪威尔先生、戴高乐先生和尼赫鲁先生的头封信中提出了召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、英国、美国、法国和印度政府首脑会议，以采取紧急措施制止在近东发生的军事冲突。
    当时和现在我们都深信，如果用认真的态度来研究这些重要问题，那末，按照我们所建议组成的政府首脑会议就会为了普遍和平的利益而能最迅速最有成效地解决已经发生的冲突。
    我们向各大国政府首脑建议召开这一会议，是因为他们的一致意见会表明各大国政府能用实事求是的态度来解决极其重大的国际问题。而我们最大的希望也正是寄托在大家都能表现出这种态度上面。苏联政府之所以认为上述各国政府首脑会议具有重大意义，是因为这些国家都是极强大的国家，他们的态度在很大程度上将决定事态向哪一个方向发展——向和平方向还是向战争方向发展。我们认为，所有上述各国的领导人都会明智地了解当前事态的性质及其发展方向，也会了解，如果战争爆发，它将会产生什么结果，它将会给人类带来多么无穷无尽的灾难。
    然而，遗憾的是，我们的期望并没有实现。在印度总理尼赫鲁先生和法国总理戴高乐先生接受了我们主张召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议的建议的时候，美国总统却拒绝了这次会议，而您在这方面事实上是支持他的。
    当苏联政府提出的五国政府首脑会议由于决非我方过错而不能召开时，苏联政府就积极支持您所提出的关于在安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议讨论中近东局势的建议。在这方面我们所指的只是举行在安全理事会范围内的五国政府首脑会议，而不是举行别的会议。
    此外，您在7月22日的信中强调指出，英国政府认为，在这次安全理事会特别会议上不应提出任何不经事先协商的决议案。换句话说，您认为，目的在于达成有成效的协议，而不在于用表决的办法把分歧确定下来。这就是说，关于中近东局势的主要会谈应当在有哈马舍尔德先生参加的五国政府首脑间进行。
    但是，您在7月26日信中只不过说政府首脑出席安全理事会会议，而在7月31日信中则只是暗示有可能安排政府首脑不完全正式性的会议来讨论安全理事会上所讨论的问题。
    从美国政府历次的信件和说明中，尤其是从艾森豪威尔7月25日的信中可以十分清楚地看出，这里所指的仅仅是召开安全理事会一般常会来讨论中近东局势问题，而安全理事会由于它目前的组成存在着种种消极方面和缺点，关于这一点，我在8月5日的信中已经谈到过，现在无需再谈。而您，首相先生，实质上同意美国总统的这种建议。
    此外，在杜勒斯先生7月31日举行了记者招待会之后十分明显，美国政府——而英国政府附和美国政府——决定利用安全理事会的这种会议来为美英在中近东的侵略行动辩解，并且用根本不存在的所谓“间接侵略”威胁的说法把由于美英武装干涉所造成的中近东危险局势的责任推卸给其他国家。由此可见，在美英两国政府建议召开的安全理事会会议上，各国政府首脑不可能认真地讨论中近东局势问题，而只会白白浪费时间，因为没有任何理由认为，在目前安全理事会组成的情况下，联合国的这个机构能像各国人民所要求的那样保证正确解决这个问题以利于和平。
    这样，美国一方面被迫接受这个建议，另一方面却在英国支持下无疑地想把我们拉进一场没有结果的争论的迷宫中。在这种情况下，我们就得出了一个结论，为了尽快地采取制止侵略的必要措施，应当召开联合国大会紧急会议，而不是安全理事会。
    同时，我们还认为，联合国大会是这一国际组织最具有代表性的机关，参加大会的不仅有加入美国占统治地位的军事侵略集团的国家的代表，而且还有其他国家——社会主义国家和不参加任何集团的国家的代表。至于遭受上述军事集团国家直接间接侵略的阿拉伯国家也将出席大会，那我就不必多说了。十分明显，已开幕的联合国大会紧急会议可以让所有大小国家在这一方面陈述它们的立场，设法求得有助于恢复中近东地区和平和保证这一地区安全的解决方案。苏联政府指派了苏联外交部长率领一个代表团参加大会。
    至于谈到我在8月5日信中有一个地方曾经谈到，必须重新研究按照我们原先所建议的组成来举行政府首脑会议以便讨论广泛的迫切需要解决的国际问题，那么，您借口您7月1日有关召开高级会议的信件没有得到回答这一点，实际上回避问题的实质。当然，我们也不会不答复您这封信。但是，不能忘记，当我们就召开政府首脑会议以缓和国际紧张局势进行谈判时，英国和美国对近东进行了武装干涉。这种行动使世界濒临世界大战的边缘。当然，在这种情况下首要的任务是制止侵略和维护世界这一地区的和平。本着这个目的，苏联政府当时提议，立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、英、美、法、印五国政府首脑会议来讨论由于美国和英国的武装干涉而在中近东造成的局势问题。
    首相先生，我们希望，已经开始举行的联合国大会紧急会议能够解决它所面临的任务，从而给召开东西方国家领导人会议大大扫清道路，召开这样会议的迫切性由于中近东的最近事件已经日益明显了。
    此致
        敬意
                尼·赫鲁晓夫
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦7日写了一封简短回信，答复赫鲁晓夫8月5日来信中关于召开联合国大会紧急会议讨论美英干涉军撤出中东的建议。
    麦克米伦在信里面一方面表示他“可以接受”苏联政府的召开联大紧急会议的建议，但是另一方面，他再一次贩卖美英两国蓄意埋葬最高级会议的举行安全理事会会议的计议，他硬说，举行实际上瘫痪了的、只能听从美国意志行事的安全理事会会议可以使中东问题
  “取得较大的进展”。
    麦克米伦在复信的末尾谈到苏联老早提出的举行东西方最高级会议的问题。他在这方面没有提出什么具体的意见，只是表示希望“根据大家都可以接受的条件”举行这样一次会议。
