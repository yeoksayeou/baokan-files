Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Cotton is now in its peak flowering and boll-forming period, and cotton field management and bumper cotton harvests are entering a decisive stage. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture told Xinhua reporters: According to reports from various regions and investigations by Ministry of Agriculture staff in rural areas: the majority of the nation's 90 million mu of cotton fields are growing normally, with neat and robust cotton seedlings, and the density of cotton plants is generally greater than in previous years; early-stage pest and disease control has been effective, and cotton aphids, the most common and serious pest in cotton fields, have been basically controlled this year. Although this year's cotton growth period has encountered some unfavorable natural conditions, thanks to a series of measures and strengthened cotton field management, cotton growth is significantly better than in previous years, and a great leap forward and bumper harvest in cotton production this year are entirely hopeful.

The Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson continued: Although the general foundation for this year's cotton production is good, there are currently two different situations in cotton field management: one is where management is tightly grasped and various yield-increasing measures are earnestly implemented, and the cotton is growing very well; the other is where management and specific measures are insufficient, resulting in less successful cotton growth and some cotton fields experiencing relatively serious soil compaction and weed infestation. This is the main problem in current cotton production. If these cotton fields are not quickly brought up to par, it will affect the overall leap forward in production requirements.

The Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson said: Cotton is a crop with great potential for increased production, and we cannot allow the growth rate of cotton production to lag behind that of wheat and early rice. We must strive for a bumper cotton harvest nationwide this year, and in cotton production, each province should have several "marshals" enthroned at the county level, and launch high-yield "satellites." All regions are making every effort to ensure that this is achieved. Now, with about three months remaining in the main cotton growth period, the key to striving for a bumper cotton harvest nationwide lies in strengthening cotton field management during this final stage. The Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson emphasized: In previous years, cotton field management was generally relaxed after August, which was a serious shortcoming in cotton production management, with a significant impact on cotton yield and quality. This year, with the demand for a comprehensive leap forward in production and the creation of high-yield "marshal" and "satellite" models, we must completely break with the past convention of neglecting or underestimating late-stage cotton field management, adopt a spirit of innovation, and effectively strengthen late-stage management.

The spokesperson said that strengthening late-stage cotton field management should focus on the following measures: First, prevent waterlogging and combat drought. Autumn waterlogging is the most serious threat to cotton production in many cotton-growing areas, and all drainage and flood prevention facilities must be strengthened. In areas experiencing summer drought or encountering autumn drought, cotton fields should also be irrigated in a timely manner to combat drought. Second, continue to thoroughly control late-stage insect pests. Although the first generation of cotton bollworms has been controlled this year, the second generation of cotton bollworms has now hatched and is harming many cotton fields, and plant bugs, leafhoppers, and spider mites are also spreading and harming many cotton fields. Other bud and boll-stage pests are also occurring. The situation of pest infestations in cotton fields this year is heavier and more numerous than in previous years, and we must not be negligent in the slightest regarding late-stage insect pests. We must strengthen pest monitoring, closely monitor the patterns of pest occurrence, and continuously carry out thorough control to ensure that cotton is not harmed by pests and diseases throughout its entire growth period. Third, quickly eliminate weed infestation and soil compaction in cotton fields. Weeds in cotton fields compete with cotton plants for nutrients, and soil compaction is extremely detrimental to cotton plant nutrition. Timely cultivation and weeding must be carried out after rain or irrigation to eliminate soil compaction and weed infestation and ensure that cotton plants have a good nutritional environment. Although most cotton fields have already been ridged, efforts should still be made to enter and operate, and cotton field cultivation and weeding should continue. Fourth, apply supplemental fertilizer. In previous years, fertilization of cotton was generally stopped after August. This year, our yield requirements are different, and we must pay attention to late-stage fertilization. Although fertilizer application in cotton fields has generally increased this year, the amount of supplemental fertilizer is insufficient, and late-stage fertilizer deficiency in cotton is still a relatively common phenomenon. Therefore, supplemental late-stage fertilizer should be appropriately applied according to soil conditions and plant growth, both to ensure that there is no fertilizer deficiency in the later stages and to prevent excessive growth and late maturity. Fifth, do a good job of pruning. This year's cotton cultivation conditions and yield requirements have been greatly improved compared to previous years, and pruning requirements should also be different from the past. Pruning should be frequent, meticulous, and based on cotton plant growth, with reference to yield requirements and seasonal conditions, appropriately delaying topping time and retaining more fruiting branches and nodes. The general requirement for these main late-stage management measures is to promote more boll formation and reduce shedding, to achieve the goal of preserving bolls and increasing production. In addition, before cotton begins to bloom in August and September, agricultural cooperatives in cotton-growing areas should also do a good job of field selection, universally implement seed retention, and select and retain the seeds they need.

The spokesperson concluded that in order to effectively carry out late-stage cotton field management, all regions must put politics in command, mobilize the masses to create innovations, adopt reasonable management techniques according to local conditions, do a good job of labor arrangement, create and improve improved tools suitable for late-stage cotton field management, and ensure the timely implementation of various measures. All regions must strengthen cotton field management in the last three months without any relaxation until the cotton is harvested and stored. We must do everything possible to achieve a high-speed leap in cotton production nationwide this year.

### 采取革新精神　打破陈规旧矩  切实加强棉田后期管理  让九千万亩棉花实现高速度的跃进增产

    采取革新精神　打破陈规旧矩
    切实加强棉田后期管理
    让九千万亩棉花实现高速度的跃进增产
    新华社2日讯　目前棉花已到开花结铃盛期，棉田管理和棉花丰产正进入决战阶段。农业部发言人向新华社记者说：据各地报告材料和农业部工作人员下乡调查的情况：现全国九千多万亩棉田大部分生长发育正常，棉苗整齐健壮，棉株密度一般比往年加大；前期病虫害防治得好，为害棉田最普遍最严重的棉蚜，今年已基本上得到了控制。今年棉花生育期间虽遭遇到一些不利的自然条件，由于采取一系列的措施，加强了棉田管理工作，棉花生长显著比往年好，实现今年棉花生产的大跃进、大丰收，完全有望。
    农业部发言人接着说：今年的棉花生产一般基础虽然较好，但目前在棉田管理工作上有着两类不同的情况：一类是管理工作抓得紧，切实贯彻执行各项增产措施的，棉花长得很好；另一类是管理工作和具体措施都搞得不够，因而棉花长得不太好并有部分棉田发生相当严重的板结和草害现象。这是当前棉花生产上的主要问题。这一类棉田如果不赶快赶上来，就会影响到全面跃进增产的要求。
    农业部发言人说：棉花是增产潜力很大的作物，不能让棉花的增产速度落后于小麦和早稻，我们一定要力争今年全国棉花大丰收，要在棉花方面每个省以县为单位有若干“元帅”升帐，并且放出高额丰产的“卫星”。各地正在尽一切努力来保证其实现。现在，棉花的主要生育期还有三个月左右的时间，力争全国棉花大丰收，关键在于加强这最后一个阶段的棉田管理工作。农业部发言人强调指出：往年，棉田一到8月以后，一般就放松田间管理了，这是过去在棉花生产管理工作上的严重缺点，对棉花的产量和质量影响都很大。今年要求全面跃进增产，要求创造高额丰产“元帅”“卫星”，必须彻底打破过去忽视或轻视棉田后期管理工作的常规，采取革新精神，切实加强后期管理工作。
    发言人说，加强棉田后期管理应抓紧以下措施：第一、防涝抗旱。秋涝在许多棉区是对棉花产量最严重的威胁，必须加强一切排水防涝的设施。有伏旱或遇到秋旱的地区，棉田也要及时进行抗旱灌溉。第二、继续彻底防治后期虫害。今年棉田棉铃虫第一代虽已治了下去，目前许多棉田第二代棉铃虫又已孵化为害，盲椿象、叶跳虫、红蜘蛛也在不少棉田蔓延为害，其他蕾铃期害虫也都有发生，今年棉田害虫发生的情况比往年重而多，我们决不能对后期虫害有丝毫的麻痹大意，必须加强虫情检查，严密掌握虫害发生规律，连续进行彻底防治，保证棉花全生长期不受病虫危害。第三、迅速消灭棉田草害和板结现象。棉田杂草和棉株争夺养分，棉田板结对棉株营养是极不利的条件，必须做到雨后、灌溉后及时中耕除草，消灭板结和草害，保证棉株有良好的营养环境。现在棉田虽然大部已经封垅，也要设法进去操作，将棉田中耕除草工作延续下去。第四、追肥补肥。往年一般棉花栽培，8月以后就不再追肥了。今年我们的产量要求不同，还一定要注意后期的追肥补肥工作。今年棉田施肥一般虽已增加，但追肥数量不足，棉花后期缺肥还是相当普遍现象，因此，应根据土壤条件和植株生长情况，因地因块适当补充后期追肥，既要保证后期不脱肥，又要防免不使形成徒长晚熟。第五、做好整枝管理工作。今年棉花的栽培条件和产量要求都比往年大大提高了，整枝的要求也应和过去有所不同。整枝要勤，要细致，要根据棉株生育情况，参照产量要求和季节条件，适当延迟打顶时间，多留果枝和果节。以上这几项后期管理的主要措施，总的要求是多结桃、少脱落，达到保桃丰产的目的。另外，在8、9月棉花开始吐絮以前，棉区农业社还要做好田间选种工作，普遍实施自留种，选留自己所需要的种子。
    发言人最后说，为了切实做好棉田后期管理工作，各地必须政治挂帅，发动群众创造革新，因地因块采取合理的管理技术，做好劳力安排，创造和改进适于棉田后期管理的改良工具，保证各项措施的及时实施。各地要一步不放松地加强后期三个月的棉田管理工作，直到收花进仓为止。我们要千方百计地尽一切的努力，来实现今年全国棉花高速度的跃进增产。
