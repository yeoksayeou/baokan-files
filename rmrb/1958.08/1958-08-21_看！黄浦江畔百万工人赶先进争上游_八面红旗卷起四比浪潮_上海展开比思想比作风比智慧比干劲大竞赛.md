Shanghai Launches a Grand Competition to Compare Ideology, Style, Wisdom, and Drive
The People's Daily, Shanghai, August 20th - A new leap forward upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced has rapidly unfolded on Shanghai's industrial front. A socialist grand competition of comparing ideology, comparing style, comparing wisdom, and comparing drive has begun to take shape between industries and factories.
As early as mid-July, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the leap forward situation in the city's industrial and agricultural production and various tasks, believing that the leap forward situation had already taken shape, and the rectification movement had achieved tremendous results. However, development was uneven: a few were making great leaps forward, most were making moderate leaps forward, and a few were making small leaps forward or even no leaps forward. The Municipal Committee believed that this unbalanced situation reflected the fact that the sentiment of many cadres being content with mediocrity had not yet been transformed. Based on the above situation, the Municipal Committee put forward a policy of promoting the leap forward for the city, demanding the creation of a situation where no corner of the city would be left outside the ranks of the great leap forward; to make those with the idea of being content with mediocrity unable to "be content" and unable to muddle through in the middle. To this end, at the beginning of August, the Municipal Committee appointed someone to preliminarily summarize the advanced experiences of eight factories in the city with relatively advanced production, erected eight red flags, and called for a leap forward upsurge of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced in the city.
The development of the situation fully confirmed the Municipal Committee's analysis. This upsurge came with great force, and the ideas of being content with mediocrity and conservative complacency were the first to bear the brunt and were severely impacted. "Forcing" and "catching up" are distinct characteristics of this new upsurge. The masses of workers in many factories have come forward to "force" the leaders to "get on their horses," criticizing the leaders, "Why can others make great leaps forward, but we only make small leaps forward?" Workers at the Xin'an Electric Motor Factory told their leading cadres, "We don't ask much of you, we only hope you can help us at some key points." Many leading cadres in factories have examined their ideas of conservative complacency. This "forcing" situation has not only occurred between leaders and the masses, but also between workshops, factories, and colleagues.
Layer upon layer of forcing is also accompanied by relentless pursuit. The Hudong, Zhonghua, and Qiuxin shipyards have all shouted the slogan "Learn from Jiangnan, Catch up with Jiangnan, Surpass Jiangnan." The slogan of the cotton textile workers to catch up with the State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory is "Even if you fly to the edge of the white clouds, we will still catch up with the sky."
Another characteristic of this re-leap forward situation is the close combination of achieving a great leap forward and vigorously carrying out technological revolution. Many factories have established technological revolution organizations, and factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and technical personnel have moved into the factories, living and working with the workers, and jointly studying new problems that have emerged after the production leap forward. The Hudong Factory, concentrated in the Yangpu District, also immediately launched a technological revolution competition.
This re-leap forward upsurge centered on vigorously carrying out technological revolution will be an important guarantee for completing the city's leap forward plan for this year. From January to July this year, the city has completed 52.8% of the annual production plan, but for the steel and electromechanical industries, which have seen a large increase in growth, 60% to 70% of the annual tasks need to be completed in the second half of the year. Therefore, the leap forward in the third quarter will have a decisive impact on the completion of the annual plan. (Attached picture)

Compare ideology, promote the communist spirit!
Compare style, become one with the workers and peasants!
Compare wisdom, vigorously carry out technological and cultural revolutions! Compare drive, leap forward, and re-leap forward!

　　看！黄浦江畔百万工人赶先进争上游
    八面红旗卷起四比浪潮
    上海展开比思想比作风比智慧比干劲大竞赛
    本报上海20日电  学习先进、猛赶先进、超过先进的新的跃进高潮，已在上海工业战线上迅速展开。在行业与行业、厂与厂之间，一个比思想、比作风、比智慧、比干劲的社会主义大竞赛开始形成。
    还在7月中，中共上海市委会就分析了全市工农业生产和各项工作的跃进情况，认为跃进的形势已经形成，整风运动已取得巨大成果。但发展不平衡：大跃进的是少数，多数是中跃进，还有少数是小跃进甚至没有跃进。市委认为：这种不平衡的状况，反映出不少干部甘居中游的情绪尚未转变。根据上述情况，市委对全市的跃进提出了促进的方针，要求造成这样一种形势：要使全市没有一个角落留在大跃进行列的外面；要使具有甘居中游思想的人“甘”不下去，中游的日子混不下去。为此，市委在8月初指定专人初步总结了全市生产比较先进的八个工厂的先进经验，竖起八面红旗，号召在全市开展一个学先进、赶先进的跃进高潮。
    形势的发展，完全证实了市委的分析。这一高潮，来势汹涌，中游思想、保守自满思想首当其冲，受到猛烈的冲击，“逼”和“赶”是这次新高潮的一个鲜明特点。许多工厂的职工群众纷纷起来“逼”领导“上马”，批评领导“为什么人家能够大跃进，我们只是小跃进？”新安电机厂工人对领导干部说：“我们对你们要求不多，只希望在一些骨节眼上帮一下忙。”许多工厂的领导干部检讨了保守自满思想。这种“逼”的形势，不仅在领导与群众之间，而且也在车间与车间、厂与厂、同行与同行间出现了。
    层层相逼还伴随着穷追猛赶。沪东、中华、求新等造船厂，都喊出“学江南、赶江南、超过江南”的口号。棉纺织业职工赶国棉二厂的口号是“任你飞到白云边，我们也要追上天”。
    这次再跃进形势的另一特点是实现大跃进和大闹技术革命密切结合起来。很多工厂成立了技术革命的组织，厂长、党委书记和技术人员都搬进厂内，与工人同住、同劳动，共同研究生产跃进后出现的新问题。集中在杨浦区的沪东工厂也立即展开了技术革命的竞赛。
    这次以大闹技术革命为中心的再跃进高潮对完成今年全市跃进计划将是一个重要保证。今年1到7月，全市已完成全年生产计划52.8％，但增长幅度较大的钢铁、机电工业，全年百分之六、七十的任务需要在下半年完成。因此，第三季度的跃进对完成全年计划将有决定作用。（附图片）

　　比思想，发扬共产主义精神！
    比作风，同工农群众打成一片！
    比智慧，大闹技术革命和文化革命！  比干劲，跃进、再跃进！
