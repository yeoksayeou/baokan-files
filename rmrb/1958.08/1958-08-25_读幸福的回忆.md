　　Reading "Happy Memories," everyone will feel happiness from this "memory." This happiness is none other than Chairman Mao's teachings to Comrade Chen Changfeng, which apply to all comrades willing to serve the people.

　　Being an official was something many people aspired to in the old society. To become an official, many people devoted their entire lives to scheming, truly "giving their all until their dying breath." The various characters depicted in "Officialdom Unmasked" are, in many cases, typical of those who actually existed in the officialdom.

　　But in a country led by the Communist Party, not only have those who "want to be officials" "come to the wrong place" and "cannot achieve their goals," but all revolutionary cadres are also not allowed to be tainted with any bureaucratic airs. No matter who it is, as long as they are tainted with bureaucratic airs, we must sweep away those airs.

　　By comparison: why was the old society like that, and the new society is like this? The reason is very simple, because we truly serve the working people.

### 读幸福的回忆

　　读幸福的回忆
    读了“幸福的回忆”，谁都会从这个“回忆”中感到幸福。这个幸福不是别的，就是毛主席对陈昌奉同志的教导，适用于一切愿意为人民服务的同志。
    当官，这在旧社会曾经是多少人向往的一件事。为了当官，许多人毕生钻营，真是“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”。“官场现形记”里描绘的形形色色的人物，有许多就是所谓官场上实际存在的典型。
    但在共产党领导的国家里，不但“想当官的人”“走错门啦”，“达不到目的”，而且一切革命干部也不允许沾染任何官气。不管是谁，只要沾染了官气，我们就一定要把官气扫掉。
    比较一下：为什么旧社会是那样，新社会是这样？原因很简单，因为我们真正是为劳动人民服务。
