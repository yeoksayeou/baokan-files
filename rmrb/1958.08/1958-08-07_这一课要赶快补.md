This Lesson Must Be Quickly Made Up
Yu Shu

In the recent widespread production inspections conducted by the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee and Jianyang County Committee of Sichuan Province, and the Nanchong County Committee, a problem was almost universally discovered: that is, some elements with serious antagonistic sentiments towards the socialist system, or cadres with serious right-leaning sentiments, still hold leadership positions in a few townships and cooperatives. Here, the fundamental question of whether to take the capitalist road or the socialist road has not been thoroughly resolved. Therefore, there is no leap forward here, but fundamental stagnation, causing the work of these townships and cooperatives to stagnate in a very backward state.

Analyzing the incomplete materials obtained from the inspection, there are two situations:

One situation is that although rectification was carried out last winter, the rectification was not thorough, right and wrong were not clearly distinguished, and those elements who were seriously dissatisfied with socialism were not thoroughly criticized and continued to hold leading positions in townships and cooperatives. This was the case with Lu Deming, the head of the Dequan Old Cooperative in Sanxing Township, Wenjiang County, Wenjiang Prefecture. Since 1953, he had resisted the Party's grain purchase policy every year and was criticized every year, but this serious problem was not thoroughly resolved during last year's rectification. As a result, the implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies during this year's Great Leap Forward was severely hindered.

The other situation is that some cadres with serious right-leaning sentiments were not exposed during last year's rectification, but were fully exposed during this year's Great Leap Forward in Production. This situation was discovered in Wenjiang Prefecture, Jianyang County, and Nanchong County. Many of the Party's guidelines, policies, and specific measures for leading the Great Leap Forward were met with resistance by these cadres. When the Party arranged for rice seedlings to be densely planted, these cadres insisted that the masses adhere to sparse planting; when the Party mobilized the masses to replant seedlings, these cadres prevented the masses from replanting seedlings. They even completely ignored the criticisms of the County Committee's production inspection team. You criticize your way, I do my way.

According to Comrade Zhang Yunfeng, the First Secretary of the Jianyang County Committee, backward cooperatives account for about 8% of all cooperatives in Jianyang. Although there are no precise statistics, he estimates that a large part of the reason why backward cooperatives are backward is that the struggle between the two roads has not been correctly resolved. According to Comrade Jin Guoqiang, the Secretary of the Nanchong County Committee, backward cooperatives account for about 10% of all cooperatives in Nanchong, and a considerable number of these cooperatives have the problem of the two roads.

It is estimated that similar situations exist not only in Sichuan but also in other regions. The contradiction between the socialist and capitalist roads is originally the main contradiction of the transition period. In the Great Leap Forward that determines that socialism will ultimately defeat capitalism, it is not surprising that there are sharp contradictions between the two roads in some townships and cooperatives. The question is how to resolve this contradiction: is it to adopt a thorough solution or an incomplete solution? One method is to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, extensively present the facts, and profoundly explain the principles, so as to thoroughly resolve the issue of the struggle between the two roads in the minds of cadres and the masses. This is a thorough solution. The rectification and make-up lessons started in Wenjiang Prefecture in July adopted this method. Another method is to only conduct general debates in conjunction with current production, such as whether the yield per mu can reach 1,500 jin, whether the late rice yield can exceed the early rice, etc., and to adjust and replace individual cadres. This is not a thorough solution to the problem.

Why adopt this method that cannot completely solve the problem? One of the main reasons is that production is too busy, there is no time, let's talk about it later! It is true that production is too busy, but in the countryside, which is in a continuous leap forward and constantly revolutionary upsurge, the minor spring is busy before the major spring, production is busy before capital construction, and the year is busy from beginning to end, when will it not be too busy and have time? In this way, the so-called "talk about it later" will actually be difficult to have time for "talk about it later," and the result will be procrastination. So the problem is not whether it is busy or not, but whether it is squeezed. As long as it is squeezed, time will come out. The current countryside is a scene of ten thousand horses galloping with production as the center and a comprehensive leap forward. I don’t know how many tasks are carried out in the middle of "squeezing". Why can't we squeeze out time for rectification and make-up lessons in a small number of townships and a small number of cooperatives?

"Politics takes command, and ideology goes first" is a fighting slogan that is universally popular in various regions, and it is also a working method that has been universally implemented in various regions since the Great Leap Forward. The struggle between the two roads can be said to be the most important political and ideological issue in the countryside, and rectification is the basic method to solve this political and ideological issue. How can we not take command and go first? There is no doubt that rectification and make-up lessons require time and manpower. Therefore, production may be slightly affected during the short period of make-up lessons. However, if we do not take thorough make-up lessons but take other incomplete methods, the impact on production will not be small, but great. It is conceivable that without raising the red flag of taking the socialist road in the minds of cadres and the masses, is it possible to organize a socialist great leap forward? If a thorough method of make-up lessons is adopted and the fundamental problem of the struggle between the two roads is solved, even if production is slightly affected at the beginning, subsequent production will be greatly harvested. Which method should be adopted? Isn't it clear?

Some comrades believe that adjusting and replacing some cadres can also solve the problem. This view is also incorrect. Adjusting and replacing some cadres is of course necessary and can solve some problems, but it cannot solve the problem fundamentally. The capitalist ideology of some cadres who are seriously dissatisfied with socialism is not water without a source or a tree without roots in the countryside. Replacing them does not mean that the capitalist tendencies in the countryside have been overcome. It should be known that the large number of well-to-do middle peasants with capitalist tendencies still existing in the countryside are precisely the social foundation of these cadres' capitalist ideology. The well-to-do middle peasants influence these cadres, and these cadres also influence the well-to-do middle peasants. Moreover, in all places where the struggle between the two roads has not been fundamentally resolved, the capitalist tendencies of the well-to-do middle peasants also affect some poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, in such places, merely adjusting and replacing some cadres cannot solve the problem of the poor and lower-middle peasants being influenced by the well-to-do middle peasants, let alone solve the problem of the capitalist tendencies of the well-to-do middle peasants. To solve these problems, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to speak out freely and thoroughly clarify the major issues of right and wrong. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of profoundly educating cadres and profoundly educating the broad masses, and achieve the purpose of opening up the socialist road and blocking the capitalist road. Only in this way can the Party's guidelines and policies be grasped by the broad masses, and all work can be invincible. As for adjusting and replacing some cadres, that is the natural result of rectification and make-up lessons.

Therefore, we should come to such a conclusion that wherever there is a sharp contradiction between the two roads, no matter which of the aforementioned situations it belongs to, we must adopt a thorough method to resolve this contradiction, that is, rectification and make-up lessons, and it must be thorough. This is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in the countryside. This is the basic construction of political and ideological work in the countryside. Without this basic construction, there is no guarantee for the current Great Leap Forward in Production and the Great Leap Forward in Capital Construction in the autumn.

    这一课要赶快补
    于蜀
    四川省温江地委、简阳县委、南充县委在最近普遍进行的生产大检查中，几乎普遍地发现了一个问题：就是一些对社会主义制度有严重抵触情绪的分子，或有严重右倾情绪的干部，仍然掌握着少数乡和合作社的领导权。在这里，走资本主义道路，还是走社会主义道路这样根本的问题，并没有彻底解决。因此，在这里不是什么跃进，而是根本不动，使这些乡和社的工作停滞在非常落后的状态中。
    从检查所得的不完全的材料分析，情况有两种：
    一种情况是：去年冬天虽然进行了整风，但整风整得不彻底，是非分得不清楚，那些对社会主义严重不满的分子并没有受到彻底的批判，继续担任着乡的和合作社的领导职务。如温江专区的温江县三圣乡德全老社的社长卢德明就是这样。他从1953年以来，对党的粮食统购政策年年抵触，年年批判，去年整风中，对这一严重问题仍未彻底解决。结果今年大跃进中党的方针政策的贯彻就受到重重阻碍。
    另一种情况是：有些有严重右倾情绪的干部在去年整风中并未暴露，而在今年生产大跃进中完全暴露出来了。这种情况在温江专区、简阳县和南充县都有发现。党领导大跃进的很多方针政策和具体措施，一碰到这些干部就顶了牛。党布置稻秧要密植，这些干部却要群众坚持稀植；党动员群众补秧，这些干部却阻止群众补秧。甚至对县委生产检查团的批评根本置之不理。你批评你的，我干我的。
    据简阳县委第一书记张云峰同志谈，落后社在简阳全部合作社中约占8％，虽无精确统计，他估计有很大一部分落后社所以落后就是因为两条道路的斗争没有正确解决。据南充县委书记晋国强同志估计，落后社在南充全部合作社中约占10％，其中有相当一部分合作社中存在着两条道路的问题。
    估计类似情况不仅四川有，其他地区也一定会有。社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾，本来是过渡时期的主要矛盾，在决定社会主义要最后战胜资本主义的大跃进中，在部分乡和合作社中发生两条道路的尖锐的矛盾，这是丝毫不足为奇的。问题是如何解决这种矛盾，是采取彻底的解决办法呢？还是采取不彻底的解决办法？一种办法是发动群众大鸣大争，大量摆事实，深刻讲道理，在干部和群众思想中彻底解决两条道路斗争的问题，这就是彻底解决的办法。温江专区从7月开始的整风补课就是采取的这种办法。还有一种办法只是结合当前生产作一般的辩论，如亩产能不能达到一千五百斤，晚稻产量能不能超过早稻等等，对个别干部进行调整和撤换，这就不是彻底解决问题的办法。
    为什么要采取这种不能彻底解决问题的办法呢？一个最主要的原因就是：生产太忙，没有时间，以后再说吧！生产太忙当然是事实，但是，处在连续跃进、不断革命高潮中的农村，小春忙过大春忙，生产忙过基本建设忙，一年忙到头，什么时候会不太忙而会有时间呢？这样，所谓“以后再说”，实际上以后也很难有“再说”的时间，结果就会一拖再拖、不了了之。所以问题不在于忙不忙，而在于挤不挤，只要挤，时间就会出来，现在的农村是以生产为中心的万马齐奔，全面跃进，不知道多少工作都是在“挤”的中间进行的，为什么在一小部分乡和一小部分社就不能挤出时间进行整风补课呢？
      “政治作统帅，思想要先行”，这是在各个地区普遍流行的一个战斗口号，也是各个地区在大跃进以来普遍实行的一种工作方法。两条道路的斗争可以说是农村中最主要的政治问题和思想问题，整风就是解决这个政治问题和思想问题的基本方法，如何能够不作统帅，不去先行呢？毫无疑问，要进行整风补课，要花时间，要花人力，因此，在补课的一段短短的时间中对生产可能小有影响。但是，不采取彻底的补课的办法，而采取不彻底的其他办法，对生产就不是小有影响，而是大有影响。可以想像，不在干部和群众思想中树起走社会主义道路这面红旗，要组织社会主义大跃进是可能的吗？如果采取彻底补课的办法，解决了两条道路斗争的根本问题，即使开头生产小受影响，以后的生产便会大有收获。应该采取那条办法？不是清清楚楚吗？
    有些同志认为调整和撤换一些干部也可以解决问题，这种看法，同样不正确。调整和撤换一些干部当然必要，也可以解决一部分问题，但是并不能从根本上解决问题。一些对社会主义严重不满的干部，他们的资本主义思想在农村中并非无源之水，无本之木，换掉了他们，并不等于就克服了农村中的资本主义倾向。要知道农村中还大量存在的具有资本主义倾向的富裕中农，正是这些干部的资本主义思想的社会基础。富裕中农影响着这些干部，这些干部也影响着富裕中农。而且，凡是没有从根本上解决两条道路斗争问题的地方，富裕中农的资本主义倾向也同样影响着一部分贫农和下中农。因此，在这样的地方，仅仅调整和撤换一些干部，既不能解决贫农和下中农受富裕中农影响的问题，更不能解决富裕中农资本主义倾向的问题。要解决这些问题，就要发动群众大鸣大争，彻底辩明大是大非，只有这样才能达到深刻教育干部、深刻教育广大群众的目的，达到开辟社会主义道路、堵塞资本主义道路的目的，也只有这样，党的方针政策才能掌握广大群众，一切工作也才能无往而不利。至于调整和撤换一些干部那是整风补课的自然结果。
    因此，应该得出这样一个结论，凡是发现两条道路发生尖锐矛盾的地方，不管属于前面所说的哪一种情况，都要采取彻底的办法解决这种矛盾，这就是整风补课，而且既补就要补彻底。这是农村中政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，这是农村政治思想工作中的基本建设，没有这种基本建设，什么目前的生产大跃进，秋后的基本建设大跃进都没有保障。
