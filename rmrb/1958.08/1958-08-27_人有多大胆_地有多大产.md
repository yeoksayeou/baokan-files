Column: Letter from Shou Zhang

　　"How daring people are, how productive the land is"
　　Editor's note: This is a letter written by a comrade from the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China who went to Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, to understand the situation. This letter vividly reflects the situation of the Great Leap Forward there and raises some thought-provoking questions. We are introducing it to readers.
    This trip to Shou Zhang was another great ideological liberation. This year, the county party committee's slogan for the grain yield per unit area in Shou Zhang is "Ensure double thousand catties, and strive for three thousand catties." But in reality, it is engaged in a county-wide high-yield movement of producing 10,000 catties of grain per mu. Producing 50,000 catties, 100,000 catties, or even hundreds of thousands of catties of sweet potatoes per mu, producing 10,000 or 20,000 catties of corn and millet per mu—such high targets are spoken of by local cadres and the masses as very ordinary and not at all mysterious. Generally, communes are also aiming for 8,000 catties or 7,000 catties, and there are very few who propose targets of 5,000 catties per mu. As for producing 1,000 or 2,000 catties per mu, no one mentions it at all. The first impression here is the great ambition.
    Their crops also grow really well, a dark mass that looks like it will collapse the ground. Although the 10,000-catty target proposed below may not be fully realized this year, 10,000-catty communes and 10,000-catty townships will definitely appear, and possibly more than one. The county as a whole is confident of producing 3,000 to 4,000 catties per mu.
    The increase in grain yield per unit area from hundreds of catties to thousands of catties is a qualitative change, and from thousands of catties to tens of thousands of catties is an even greater qualitative change. From the perspective of measures, such a high yield is nothing more than water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, etc., but there are many new things worth studying in the specific implementation of these measures. Take water and fertilizer, for example. Their method is to use a lot of water and a lot of fertilizer, allowing the crops to eat and drink their fill without any restrictions, and not being afraid of the crops having "stomach problems." It seems that the crops have very big stomachs. The high-yield mu of single-season corn and millet here generally use eight waterings and eight fertilizations, with water consumption reaching 300 to 500 cubic meters; the fertilizer used is: 200,000 to 300,000 catties of coarse fertilizer, and about 200 catties of chemical fertilizer (mainly local chemical fertilizer), with a few plots reaching 500 catties. It is still difficult to say whether they have eaten and drunk their fill, but it is definitely not excessive. In the past, many people believed that one mu of dry crops only needed 100 to 200 cubic meters of water, and that using too much chemical fertilizer would burn the crops and damage the soil. This view is obviously one-sided. The cadres here believe that as long as there is enough water and a certain amount of organic fertilizer to cooperate with, using 500 to 600 catties or even thousands of catties of chemical fertilizer per mu (referring only to one season of crops) is not only not dangerous, but also completely necessary. At the same time, water increases with fertilizer, the more fertilizer applied, the greater the amount of water used. Sufficient water and sufficient fertilizer are the primary key. Sufficient water and sufficient fertilizer must also be matched with deep plowing. This point is particularly prominent in Shou Zhang and is also the decisive link for them to be able to launch a 10,000-catty movement on a large area of land. According to Shou Zhang's experience, to produce 10,000 catties of grain, it is impossible not to dig three feet deep. This is true for land with poor soil quality that needs soil improvement, and it is also true for land with very good soil quality that does not need improvement and only needs loosening. Their high-yield fields are generally plowed three feet deep, and general fields are also plowed one and a half feet deep. They believe that it is not possible to do it if it does not exceed one foot.
    On the basis of sufficient water, sufficient fertilizer, and deep plowing, dense planting can be carried out freely. This point is particularly clear in the planting of millet. In the past, millet was planted three seedlings at a time, clump by clump, with only more than 30,000 seedlings per mu. Now their millet is planted as densely as wheat, basically without thinning, generally about 100,000 plants, and 200,000 to 260,000 plants in high-yield fields, and the ears are by no means smaller than in the past. Obviously, it is impossible to do this without deep plowing and sufficient water and fertilizer.
    Sufficient water, sufficient fertilizer, plus deep plowing, and on this basis, planting densely (of course, there must be a limit), plus their "field management like embroidery," makes producing 10,000 catties per mu a reality. Whether the 10,000-catty movement can be universally promoted and not limited to small-scale land experiments, under the condition that water conservancy has been basically solved, it seems that there are mainly two problems: one is fertilizer; the other is labor. To solve the fertilizer problem, in addition to vigorously developing local chemical fertilizer (some communes have produced 50 catties per mu), they mainly rely on demolishing broken houses and scraping the ground, with local fertilizer accounting for 80%. And local fertilizer is mainly exchanged for labor, so the center is still the labor problem.
    How many labor days does 10,000 catties of grain require? How much grain can a full laborer produce in a year using hand tools? We roughly calculated a few accounts, and it is difficult to answer because the elasticity is very large. This problem is related to the yield per mu. For example, many communes originally planned to produce double thousand catties per mu, requiring 30 workdays per mu (only calculating field and fertilizer accumulation labor, not including capital construction. Previously, when the yield per mu was 200 to 300 catties, it was about 15 workdays per mu), now the target has increased to 10,000 catties, and using the original tools, it only takes 60 to 70 workdays per mu. That is to say, the output increases four times, but the labor used only increases by one time; the higher the yield per unit area, the relatively less labor is used. This is one situation. On the other hand, it also depends on the size of the enthusiasm and the quality of the tools. According to the understanding of several communes, the main measures for a target of 10,000 catties of grain per mu (one season of corn and millet) are: deep plowing two feet, applying 250,000 catties of fertilizer, and managing like embroidery. The labor required per mu, calculated at normal labor intensity and using the original tools (iron-wheeled carts plus wooden-wheeled handcarts, animal-powered waterwheels), is at least 70 workdays; if the tools are improved and rolling bearings are implemented, 50 workdays are enough; if we go all out and add night battles, and the tool reform is more thorough, it will not even take 30 workdays! In the final analysis, we are not afraid of high targets and big measures, but we are afraid of not having enough enthusiasm and not improving tools. Shou Zhang has an average of 2.6 mu of land per person and an average of 6 mu of land per laborer. Just counting the labor account, it is absolutely impossible to engage in large-scale 10,000-catty mu, but in fact they have done it. Their iron girls or iron sisters live in the fields and are responsible for high-yield fields, and each person still needs to manage an average of two mu of land! If their plan is realized this year, each person will be able to produce 60,000 to 70,000 catties of grain on average. It seems that as long as the enthusiasm is fully mobilized, coupled with actively improving tools, it is not impossible to universally engage in the 10,000-catty movement (if needed).
    Regarding tool reform, from here, the current main problems are transportation and deep plowing. The current deep plowing can only be done for a little over a foot, and it requires a lot of very strong livestock. Under the current situation of general livestock shortage, solving the deep plowing tool is still a big problem. We also calculated an account for the transportation problem: producing 10,000 catties of grain per mu, if 74 labor days are required, then turning and leveling the land and watering each account for 6.6%, field management accounts for 10.8%, and harvesting and warehousing accounts for 12%, while transporting and applying fertilizer accounts for 64%. The latter two are labor-intensive mainly because of the large amount of labor used for transportation. Solving the transportation problem will save at least half of the labor, or even 20%-30%. Implementing rolling bearings will solve a big problem. However, the current iron-wheeled carts are very damaging to the roads. Poor roads greatly detract from the improved transportation tools. Now some communes in Gaotang County use old rubber and broken shoe soles to replace iron sheets to modify large carts, which reduces the weight of the carts, protects the roads, and frees up a lot of iron (an iron-wheeled cart has about 100 catties of iron sheets), killing three birds with one stone, which is worthy of attention. We think that if the entire North China can completely eliminate iron-wheeled carts in the short term and make all roads highways, it will not only reduce labor but also change the entire rural landscape.
    This year, a major achievement of Shou Zhang is to remove the low-yield hat from soybeans and millet. According to their experience, under the same conditions, millet has a higher yield than corn, mainly because millet, like rice, is more convenient for dense planting. From the existing conditions, it is entirely possible to densely plant 400,000 to 500,000 millet plants per mu. One millet ear weighs one tael, which is 30,000 catties per mu. Corn is different. If it is too dense, it will not be ventilated or see sunlight, which will affect growth. Now, each mu is generally only densely planted with more than 6,000 plants, with two ears per plant and one catty per ear, which is only more than 10,000 catties, and it is still very difficult to do this. Millet has both high yields and is easy to store and harvest earlier, which is conducive to timely planting of wheat. The value of corn and millet should be re-evaluated. Their soybean yield is also very high. It is estimated that 2,000 catties per mu is very common, and 10,000-catty satellites may also appear. Planting more soybeans can increase edible oil and is also a good way to solve the shortage of fertilizer. In the past, a lot of millet and soybeans were planted here, but in the past two years, due to the expansion of corn and sweet potatoes, they have been squeezed out. The contradiction between sweet potatoes and wheat here is also not small. The sweet potato planting area accounts for 45% of the cultivated land. This year, the wheat planting area will account for 90%. 80% of the sweet potato stubble will be planted with wheat, and the wheat land must be generally deeply plowed. Sweet potatoes must be sliced and dried on the spot. These two heavy tasks are squeezed together. If they are not arranged properly, it is easy to lose sight of one or the other. From these aspects, reasonably arranging crop planting next year is a problem that must be paid attention to as soon as possible.
    At present, the enthusiasm below to strive for a bumper autumn harvest is very high, but there is no general preparation for how to store it after the harvest. When we asked township and commune cadres and the masses, they initially said, "Are we still afraid of not having a way to deal with more grain?" "Let the state buy it!" After calculating the details, they were shocked and felt that there were also problems with more grain. Especially in Shou Zhang, each person will harvest about 40,000 to 50,000 catties of sweet potatoes on average. Most areas of the county are flood detention areas, and the houses are very small. In the past, the little grain was stored in the courtyard in piles. If we don't make up our minds early this year, we will suffer a big loss. We have already told the county party committee about this.　　　　Liu Xirui

### “人有多大胆　地有多大产”

专栏：寿张来信

　　“人有多大胆　地有多大产”
　　编者按：这是中共中央办公厅派赴山东寿张县了解情况的同志写回来的信。这封信生动地反映了那里大跃进的形势，提出了一些足以启发思想的问题，特把它介绍给读者。
    这次寿张之行，是思想再一次的大解放。今年寿张的粮食单位产量，县委的口号是“确保双千斤，力争三千斤”。但实际在搞全县范围的亩产万斤粮的高额丰产运动。一亩地要产五万斤、十万斤以至几十万斤红薯，一亩地要产一、两万斤玉米、谷子，这样高的指标，当地干部和群众，讲起来像很平常，一点也不神秘。一般的社也是八千斤、七千斤，提五千斤指标的已经很少。至于亩产一、两千斤，根本没人提了。这里给人的印象首先是气魄大。
    他们的庄稼也真长得好，一片黑呼呼的要压塌地。虽然下面提出的万斤指标，今年不一定完全实现，但万斤社、万斤乡一定出现，可能不止一个。全县亩产三、四千斤则是有把握的。
    粮食单位产量从百斤到千斤，是个质变，从千斤到万斤，是更大的质变；这样高产量，从措施来看，也不外是水、肥、土、种、密等几条，但在具体执行这些措施中就有许多新东西值得研究。比如水和肥吧，他们的干法是大水大肥，让作物吃饱喝足，不给什么限制，不怕作物闹“胃病”。看来，农作物的肚子大得很。这里的单季玉米、谷子丰产亩，一般是八水、八肥，用水量都达到三百至五百公方；用肥是：粗肥在二、三十万斤，化肥
  （主要是土化肥）在二百斤左右，少数地达到五百斤，是否已经吃饱喝足还难说，但决不过分。过去不少人认为一亩旱作物只需要一、二百方水，化肥用多了就要烧死庄稼，损害土壤，这种看法，很显然是有片面性的。这里干部的看法是，只要有足够的水和一定的有机质肥料相配合，一亩地（仅指一季作物）用它五、六百斤甚至上千斤的化肥不但没危险，并且完全必要。同时，水随肥涨，施的肥料愈多，用水量愈大，足水足肥是首要的关键。足水、足肥还必须和深翻相配合，这一点在寿张特别突出，也是他们能够在大面积的土地上展开万斤运动的决定环节。根据寿张的经验，要搞万斤粮，不掘地三尺是不行的。土质不好需要改良土壤的土地固然要这样作，土质很好不要改良、单是松土的土地也要这样作。他们的丰产田一般都深翻三尺，一般田也深翻尺半左右，他们认为不超过一尺是不行的。
    在足水、足肥、深翻的基础上，就可以放手密植。这一点在谷子的种植上表现得特别清楚。过去种谷子一步三安苗，一丛丛的，每亩只留苗三万多株。现在他们的谷子种得像麦子似的密，基本不间留，一般在十万株左右，丰产田二十万株到二十六万株，而穗子决不比过去小。很明显，没有深耕和足够的水和肥是作不到这一点的。
    足水足肥加深耕，在此基础上放手密植（当然要有限度）再加上他们的“田间管理如绣花”，亩产万斤就成一个现实的事物了。万斤运动能否普遍推广而不局限于小块土地试验，在水利已基本解决的条件下，看来主要是两个问题：一是肥料；二是劳力。他们解决肥料，除大搞土化肥外（有些社已生产到每亩五十斤），主要靠拆破房、刮地皮，肥料中土肥占80％。而土肥主要是靠劳力换来的，所以中心还是劳力问题。
    到底一万斤粮食要多少劳动日？到底一个全劳力使用手工工具一年能生产多少粮食？我们粗粗算了几笔账，很难答复，原因是弹性大得很。这个问题一方面和亩产多少有关系，比如许多社原来计划亩产双千斤，每亩需用三十个工（单算田间和积肥用工，不包括基本建设。以前亩产二、三百斤时，一亩十五个工左右），现在指标增到万斤，使用原来的工具，每亩地也不过六、七十个工。就是说，产量增四倍，用的劳力不过增一倍；单产愈高，用的劳动量愈相对的少。这是一种情况。另一方面，还决定干劲的大小和工具的优劣。据对几个社的了解，亩产指标万斤粮（一季玉米和谷子），主要措施是：深翻二尺，施肥二十五万斤，管理如绣花。一亩地需用的劳动工，以正常的劳动强度，使用原来的工具（铁轮车加木轮手推车、畜力水车）计算，至少要七十个工；如果对工具加以改良，实现滚珠化，有五十个工就够了；如果鼓足干劲加上夜战，工具改革的彻底些，还用不了三十个工呢！说来说去，是不怕指标高、措施大，就怕没干劲和不改良工具。寿张每人平均二点六亩地，每个劳力平均六亩地，单算劳力账，要大搞万斤亩是绝对办不到的，但实际上他们是办到了。他们的钢铁姑娘或钢铁姐妹，住到田间，专管高额丰产田，每人平均还需要管二亩地呢！他们今年的计划实现了，平均每人就能生产六、七万斤粮食。看来，只要干劲鼓得足足的，加上积极改良工具，普遍搞万斤运动（如果需要的话）不是办不到的事。
    关于工具改革，从这里看，当前主要是运输和深耕的问题。现在的深耕只能搞一尺多，而且要很多很强的牲畜，在目前畜力普遍不足的情况下，解决深耕工具还是个大问题。对运输问题，我们也算了一笔账：亩产万斤粮，如果需用七十四个劳动日的话，其中翻整土地和浇水各占6.6％，田间管理占10.8％，收获入仓占12％，而运肥、施肥就要占64％，后两项费工大主要是运输用工多。解决了运输问题，劳动用工省不了一半，也要省20％—30％。实现了滚珠化将解决很大问题。不过目前铁轮大车对道路破坏得很厉害，道路不好，使改良了的运输工具大为减色。现在高唐县有的社用旧胶皮和破鞋底代替铁皮改装大车，既减轻车的重量，又保护了道路，还腾出很多的铁（一辆铁轮车的铁皮约百余斤），一举三得，值得重视。我们想，如果全华北能在短期彻底消灭了铁轮大车，作到所有道路公路化，不但能减省劳力，对改变整个农村面貌都是有作用的。
    今年寿张一个大功绩，是要摘掉大豆和谷子的低产帽子。根据他们的经验，在同样条件下，谷子要比玉米产量高，主要原因是谷子和稻谷一样，更便于密植。从现有条件看，一亩谷子密植到四、五十万株，是完全可以办到的。一棵谷穗一两谷，一亩就是三万斤。玉米就不同，太密了，不透风、不见阳光，就要影响生长。现在每亩一般只密植到六千多株，每株二穗，一穗一斤，才一万多斤，而作到这样，还很不容易。谷子产量既高，还有便于保管和收割较早、有利于及时种小麦等好处。对玉米和谷子的身价，应该重新评评。他们的大豆产量也很高，估计亩产二千斤的很普遍，万斤卫星也可能出现。多种一些大豆，可以增加食油，也是解决肥料不足的一个好出路。这里过去种植谷子、大豆很不少，近两年来因扩大玉米和地瓜，被挤掉不少。这里的地瓜和小麦矛盾也不小，地瓜种植面积占耕地45％，今年小麦播种面积要占90％，80％的地瓜茬要种麦子，小麦地要普遍深翻，地瓜要就地切片晒干，这两项重活挤在一起，安排不好，很容易顾此失彼。从这些方面看，合理安排明年作物种植，是个必须及早注意的问题。
    目前下面对争取秋季大丰收的劲头是很大的，但对收获后如何保管，普遍没有准备。我们问乡社干部和群众时，最初他们都是“粮食多了还怕没办法？”“那由国家买吧！”经过算细账才大吃一惊，才觉得粮食多了也有问题。特别在寿张，光红薯一项大约每人平均要收四、五万斤，该县大部地区是滞洪区，房子很小，以往的一点点粮食还都是放在院子里囤起来，今年不早些打主意，非吃大亏不可。这一点，我们已向县委讲了。　　　　刘西瑞
