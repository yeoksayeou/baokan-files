    Rolling Bearings Made in Every County and District of Henan
    Shangshui, Changge and Seven Other Counties Equip all Water Lifting, Tilling, Processing and Transportation Tools with Rolling Bearings
    New Upsurge in Farm Tool Improvement to be Launched in Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong
    (Our Correspondent Zhang Jianhong reports) Henan Province has achieved brilliant success in relying on the masses to develop the rolling bearing industry on a large scale. Now, all parts of the province are advancing towards the path of rolling bearingization, requiring that all agricultural production tools powered by human or animal power be fitted with rolling bearings within the next two months, so that all rotating tools achieve bearingization.
    The scale of bearing industry development in the province is grand. Seven special districts and one hundred and eight counties have basically achieved the goal of running bearing industries in every county and district. Many special districts have universally established rolling bearing factories at the county, township, and commune levels. Xuchang Special District, including fifteen counties, has established a total of 583 bearing factories, including 105 county-run, 142 township-run, and 336 commune-run factories. As of July 30, according to incomplete statistics from Kaifeng, Xuchang, Shangqiu, and Xinyang Special Districts, more than 7 million main tools have been equipped with rolling bearings. Counties that have fully rolling bearingized water lifting, tilling, agricultural and sideline product processing, and transportation tools include Shangshui, Changge, Wuyang, Lushan, Yuxian, Xingyang, and Junxian. The vast majority of other counties have also embarked on the road of rolling bearingization.
    The local bearing industries began to emerge in March and April, only a little over 100 days ago. However, they have made astonishing progress in terms of product quantity growth and quality improvement. In the Xuchang area, originally only Changge County had individual production units manufacturing bearings, with a daily output of only a few to a dozen sets. Now, the daily output of bearings in the entire area has reached more than 73,000 sets. Several factories in general counties and cities are able to produce excellent products. For example, the smoothness of the products in Lankao County has caught up with that of state-owned factories in Shanghai, and the hardness has reached international levels. The prices of these bearings are low. Bearings that cost six or seven yuan per set on the market generally sell for only three or four yuan here.
    After the rise of the province-wide bearing industry, it has greatly promoted the tool reform movement in various places, thereby greatly solving the difficulties of lack of labor and animal power in the great leap forward in agriculture, improving the work efficiency of various agricultural activities, and making great contributions to agricultural production. For example, Junxian County liberated labor and animal power from the bearingization of various tools, making up for the planned shortage of 12.64 million labor days and 6.59 million animal labor days. The renovated tools have increased labor efficiency by two to ten times.
    Now, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all localities to achieve bearingization as soon as possible to welcome the upcoming autumn harvest. Many special districts have formulated plans based on this spirit and are actively taking action. Nanyang, Luoyang, Xinyang, and Xuchang Special Districts require that all transportation tools powered by human and animal power be equipped with bearings in August. Xinyang Special District decided to produce 1.5 million sets of bearings by August 10, renovating 80% of the water lifting, tilling, and transportation vehicles. Xinxiang Special District will complete the task of renovating all water lifting tools, plows, harrows, close planting drills, deep plows, and millstones with bearings by August 20.
    (Our Correspondent Shi Haiyun reports) This year, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region can realize the rolling bearingization of all rotating tools. This was stated by Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a telephone conference of League and Municipal Party Committee Secretaries on the evening of July 29. He said: The semi-mechanization of agriculture and animal husbandry in the autonomous region will play a major role in ensuring a comprehensive and bumper harvest of agricultural and animal husbandry production. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously implement the central government's instructions and the decisions of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, break superstitions, fully mobilize the masses, and take immediate action. At the same time, from now on, all localities must do a good job in pilot projects, establish banners, and quickly launch an upsurge.
    At the meeting, Yang Zhilin, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, deployed the measures taken by the Inner Mongolia Party Committee regarding the improvement of agricultural tools and rolling bearingization. The League and Municipal Party Committee Secretaries were full of confidence in achieving rolling bearingization this year.
    According to preliminary statistics from various localities, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has created and improved more than 2,500 new types of agricultural tools in the past seven months, totaling more than 90,000 pieces, equivalent to nine times the total number of new agricultural tools promoted throughout last year. At present, many Leagues, Banners, and Sumus (Districts) have held agricultural tool reform exhibitions, encouraging farmers of all ethnic groups to boldly research, create, and improve agricultural tools while taking measures to quickly promote new agricultural tools.
    (Our report) The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that the province will quickly launch a new upsurge in agricultural tool improvement in the shortest possible time, requiring the province to equip all improved agricultural tools with rolling bearings and achieve semi-mechanization of agricultural tools by the end of October this year. On July 28, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee put forward this combat task to Party Committees in all localities and counties at a telephone conference.
    In the first half of this year, Zhejiang Province imitated and improved more than 4,000 kinds of agricultural tools, promoting more than 10 million pieces, saving about 300 million workdays. From the end of June to July 20, during the period of rush harvesting and planting, various localities promoted more than 3.2 million pieces of new agricultural tools, saving about 100 million workdays. In order to further promote the great leap forward in agricultural production and the great liberation of labor, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee, in accordance with the central government's instructions, requires all localities in the province to quickly launch a larger-scale agricultural tool reform upsurge centered on rolling bearingization, and to equip all improved agricultural tools with rotating shafts with rolling bearings.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Committee requires that all counties and towns that are already able to manufacture rolling bearings should immediately start producing rolling bearings; and hold on-site meetings in these places to promote the experience of producing rolling bearings.
    (According to Anhui Daily) To make all agricultural tools in the province reach the level of improvement before the autumn harvest and planting, this is the fighting goal put forward at the on-site meeting for the exchange of experience in agricultural tool reform in Anhui Province held in Fuyang from July 13 to July 19.
    The representatives attending the meeting listened to the leading experience in reforming and promoting tools introduced by the Fuyang Prefectural Committee and others, and visited the entire process of manufacturing rolling bearings in the Fuyang County No. 1 Machinery Factory.
    The person in charge of the Provincial Agricultural Tool Reform Office made a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the reason why the tool reform movement in some areas had the shortcoming of "many creations and inventions, but insufficient promotion" was because some people had the idea of "perfection" and lacked understanding of the urgent demands of the broad masses for tool reform.
    The meeting held that: The current agricultural tool reform should focus on the promotion of improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, requiring that all old agricultural tools be improved before the autumn harvest and planting, and requiring that transportation vehicles and ships and rotating tools have bearings within the year, so that agricultural production is based on advanced technology.
    (Our report) Guangdong Province is vigorously developing rolling bearings by means of combining large and small, indigenous and foreign methods. At present, several small factories and handicraft cooperatives in Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Taishan and other places have produced high-speed or low-speed rolling bearings by indigenous methods; special districts and Guangzhou City are stepping up the construction of larger-scale rolling bearing factories; more counties are speeding up the mastery of the production technology of this product in order to vigorously promote it and realize the bearingization of rural tools as early as possible. The large factories run by Guangzhou City and the special districts are stepping up construction, among which the rolling bearing factories with an annual output of 150,000 sets built by Hainan, Zhanjiang, Shantou and Foshan special districts will be put into production before the end of this year. Small factories and handicraft cooperatives in various places that have never produced rolling bearings have overcome the difficulties of lack of equipment and technology under the ideological guidance of breaking superstitions and supporting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and have successively successfully trial-produced various bearings.

    河南各县各区都造滚珠轴承
    商水、长葛等七县提水、耕作、加工、运输工具全都装上滚珠轴承
    内蒙古、浙江、安徽、广东将掀起改良农具新高潮
    本报讯　记者张健虹报道：河南省依靠群众大办滚珠轴承工业已经取得辉煌成绩。现在全省各地正向着滚珠轴承化的道路进军，要求在最近两个月内把一切以人力、畜力为动力的农业生产工具都安上滚珠轴承，使一切运转工具达到轴承化。
    全省轴承工业发展的规模是宏大的。七个专区一百零八个县，基本上做到了县县区区办轴承工业。不少专区的县、乡、社三级普遍地办起了滚珠轴承厂。包括十五个县的许昌专区，共办轴承厂五百八十三个，其中县营的一百零五个，乡营的一百四十二个，还有三百三十六个是社营的。截至7月30日，据开封、许昌、商丘、信阳四个专区不完全统计，已有七百多万件主要工具装上了滚珠轴承。提水、耕作、农副业加工、运输等工具全面滚珠轴承化的有商水、长葛、舞阳、鲁山、禹县、荥阳、浚县等县。其余县份中的绝大部分，也都走上了滚珠轴承化的道路。
    各地的轴承工业，是在3、4月间开始诞生的，距今仅一百多天，在产品数量的增长和质量改进方面，却有着惊人的进步。许昌地区原来只有长葛一县个别生产单位制造轴承，一天只能生产几套到十几套，现在全区轴承日产量已达到七万三千多套了。一般的县、市都有几个厂子能够生产优秀的产品。例如兰考县产品的光洁度已赶上了上海国营工厂的产品，硬度则达到了国际水平。这些轴承的价格是低廉的，市场上价值六、七元一套的轴承，在这儿一般只售三、四元。
    全省规模的轴承工业兴起后，对于各地的工具改革运动起了巨大的推动作用，从而大大解决了农业大跃进中缺乏劳、畜力的困难，提高了各种农事活动的工作效率，对于农业生产作出了很大的贡献。例如浚县便是从各种工具轴承化中解放了劳、畜力，使计划中一千二百六十四万个劳动工日，和六百五十九万个畜工的缺额得到了弥补。改装后的各种工具提高劳动效率两倍到十倍。
    现在中共河南省委又指示各地早日实现轴承化，来迎接行将到来的秋季大丰收。许多专区已据此精神做出了规划，并且积极行动起来。南阳、洛阳、信阳、许昌各专区，要求在8月份内，将所有以人畜力为动力的运输工具，全部装上轴承，信阳专区决定8月10日，生产出轴承一百五十万套，改装占全部工具80％的提水、耕作、运输车辆等。新乡专区在8月20日，就完成所有提水工具、犁耙、密植耧、深耕犁、磨子等的改装轴承的任务。
    本报讯　记者师海云报道：内蒙古自治区今年就可使一切运转工具实现滚珠轴承化。这是中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫在7月29日晚上召开的盟、市委书记电话会议上谈的。他说：自治区农村、牧区实现半机械化对保证农牧业生产全面丰收将起重大作用，各级党委必须认真执行中央的指示和内蒙古党委的决定，打破迷信充分发动群众，立即行动起来；同时从现在起，各地都要搞好试点，树立旗帜，迅速掀起高潮。
    会上，内蒙古党委书记杨植霖把内蒙古党委关于改良农具、滚珠轴承化所采取的措施进行了布置。各盟市委书记对今年实现滚珠轴承化都充满信心。
    据各地初步统计，内蒙古自治区在今年七个月内，创造、改良的新式农具已达二千五百多种，共九万多件，相当于去年全年推广新式农具总数的九倍。目前很多盟、旗、苏木（区）举办了农具改革展览会，一面鼓励各族农民大胆研究创造和改良农具，一面采取措施迅速推广新农具。
    本报讯　中共浙江省委决定全省在最短时间内迅速掀起一个改良农具的新高潮，要求全省在今年10月底前把一切改良农具都装上滚珠轴承，实现农具半机械化。7月28日，浙江省委在电话会议上向全省各地、县委提出了这个战斗任务。
    浙江省今年上半年全省仿制和改良的农具达四千多种，推广了一千多万件，节省劳动力三亿工左右。从6月底到7月20日的抢收抢种期间，各地又推广了新式农具三百二十多万件，节省劳动力一亿工左右。为了进一步促进农业生产大跃进和劳动力大解放，浙江省委根据中央指示，要求全省各地迅速掀起一个以滚珠轴承化为中心的规模更大的农具改革高潮，要把所有有转轴的改良农具都装上滚珠轴承。
    浙江省委要求凡是已经能够制造滚珠轴承的县和乡镇，要立即动手生产滚珠轴承；并分别在这些地方举行现场会议，推广生产滚珠轴承的经验。
    据安徽日报讯　在秋收秋种前，使全省农具达到改良化，这是7月13日至7月19日在阜阳召开的安徽省农业工具改革经验交流现场会所提出的奋斗目标。
    参加会议的代表，听取了阜阳地委等介绍的改革、推广工具的领导经验，并参观了阜阳县第一机械厂制造滚珠轴承的全部过程。
    省农具改革办公室负责人在会上作了发言，他指出某些地区的工具改革运动，所以出现“创造发明很多，但推广不够”的缺点，是由于有些人存在“十全十美”的思想，对广大群众迫切要求改革工具认识不足。
    会议认为：当前农具改革应以推广改良农具和半机械化农具为主，要求在秋收秋种前，把所有的旧农具改良完，并要求在年内达到运输用车船，转动工具有轴承，将农业生产建立在先进技术基础上。
    本报讯　广东省正在以大小、土洋并举的办法大搞滚珠轴承。目前广州、湛江、台山等地已经有好几个小工厂、手工业社用土办法生产出高速或低速的滚珠轴承；各专区和广州市正加紧筹建规模较大的滚珠轴承厂；更多的县在尽快掌握这种产品的生产技术，以便大力推广，提早实现农村工具轴承化。广州市和专区办的大厂正在加紧筹建中，其中海南、湛江、汕头和佛山等专区建的年产十五万套的滚珠轴承厂，今年年底前便可投入生产。从来没有生产过滚珠轴承的各地小型工厂、手工业社，在破除迷信、支援工农业大跃进的思想指导下，克服了没有设备、不懂技术的困难，纷纷试制成功各种轴承。
