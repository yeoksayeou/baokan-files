    Four-Use Dry Battery Radio
    Wang Changqing, an employee of the Comprehensive Repair Department of the Department Store Management Department of the Yingcheng County Commercial Bureau in Hubei Province, recently successfully created a four-use dry battery radio. With this radio, even in areas without AC power, broadcast propaganda and communication activities can be carried out at any time, making it very suitable for rural use.
    It is modified on the basis of a five-tube radio. It is light, flexible, and easy to carry. It also consumes less power. It only costs 25 cents in dry battery fees for four hours of use.

    四用干电收音机
    湖北省应城县商业局百货经理部综合修理门市部职工王长青，最近创制成功一种四用干电收音机。有了这种收音机即使没有交流电的地区，也可以随时进行广播宣传和通讯活动，因此，很适合农村使用。
    它是在五灯收音机的基础上进行改装的，轻便灵活，携带方便，耗电量也较少，使用四小时只需花干电费二角五分。
