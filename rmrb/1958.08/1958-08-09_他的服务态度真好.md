    His Service Attitude is Really Good
    On July 4th, after a heavy rain, I went to the Xichang Department Store to buy rubber shoes. Because the road was muddy, my feet were covered in mud. When I arrived at the counter, a salesperson comrade with badge number 016 asked me, "Comrade, what kind of shoes do you want to buy?" His question made me hesitate, and I couldn't speak for a moment. Because my feet were covered in mud, how could I try on the shoes? This salesperson comrade saw my hesitation and immediately understood my feelings. He said with a smile, "Comrade, it doesn't matter if your feet are dirty, I'll get you a basin of water so you can wash your feet and try them on." As he said this, he turned around and brought out a basin of water for me to wash my feet, and his attitude was very warm and sincere, making it difficult for me to refuse. After I washed my feet, he helped me choose a pair of rubber shoes with a satisfactory style and suitable size. This salesperson's enthusiastic service deeply moved me.

    他的服务态度真好
    7月4日，刚下过大雨，我去西昌百货公司门市部买胶鞋。因为道路泥泞，满脚都是污泥。来到柜台前，就有个带016号证章的营业员同志问我：“同志，你要买什么鞋呀？”他这一问我，我倒作了难，一时说不出话来。因为我满脚是泥，要买鞋可怎么好试穿呢？这个营业员同志看到我犹豫不说话，立刻体会到我的心情。他微笑的说：“同志，脚脏不要紧，我给你打盆水来，把脚洗干净就可以试穿了。”说着，他转身就去端出一盆水来让我洗脚，而且态度非常殷勤诚恳，使我不好意思谢绝。我洗完脚之后，他又帮助挑选了一双式样满意尺寸合适的胶鞋。这个营业员热情的服务态度深深地感动了我。
