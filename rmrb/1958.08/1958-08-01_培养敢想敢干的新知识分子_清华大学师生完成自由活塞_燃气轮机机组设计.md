Cultivating New Intellectuals Who Dare to Think and Act
Tsinghua University Teachers and Students Complete the Design of a Free-Piston Gas Turbine Unit

(Our report) The design of a novel 3,000-horsepower free-piston gas turbine unit for locomotives was completed on July 29. This was accomplished by teachers and graduating students from the Automotive and Tractor Engine and Gas Turbine specialties of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University, who, after accepting a commission from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, completed the task in just fifteen days.

At the beginning of the design work, the Tsinghua University design team immediately faced all kinds of new problems. The first problem that arose was the issue of design philosophy. At that time, they had only a few Soviet drawings and some photographs. How should they treat this information? Everyone had different ideas. Some comrades thought that since these materials were incomplete, it was not necessary to study these designs; however, some comrades believed that since these designs were made by Soviet comrades after a long period of time, they must be advanced and reasonable and should be carefully studied and applied to their current design. When the design team's Party branch discovered this situation, it immediately convened a general meeting of all Party members to discuss it. The Party branch supported the latter opinion and promptly proposed to the entire design team: resolutely learn from the Soviet Union, study and understand these Soviet materials, and adopt the advanced Soviet structures in the design. At the same time, the Party branch also proposed to learn creatively and in conjunction with national conditions. With the thinking of the entire design team clarified and their steps unified, the speed of the design work was greatly accelerated, and the quality of the design was also guaranteed.

At different stages, the Party branch of the design team proposed new guidelines based on the ideological problems arising in the design. For example, when everyone was designing components and parts not found in the Soviet materials, the Party branch proposed: learn from production practice and be sure to choose structures that have been tested. Working under the guidance of this design philosophy greatly improved the reliability and practicality of the entire design. The bearing device of the gas turbine they designed adopted the structural form of the bearing device produced by the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory. Because this bearing device had been tested in production and use, the reliability of the entire design was improved.

A total of ninety-nine people participated in the design work, of whom only a dozen were teachers, and the rest were graduating students from Tsinghua University, with an average age of less than twenty-four. At that time, some people thought that these young people could draw drawings or do some simple design work, but it would be impossible for them to design such a complex machine. However, these young people were not discouraged in the face of such a difficult and complex task. They said: "We are students trained under the new teaching system after the teaching reform, have received production labor training, participated in the design of the Jinggangshan car, and designed an automatic chassis tractor. Now, under the leadership of the Party, we are going to advance to the design of cutting-edge products. We will definitely be able to take this fortress." In this way, they brought into play the strength of the collective. Every assembly drawing was fully discussed by everyone, and every part drawing was proofread several times. When they encountered difficulties in their work, they held Zhuge Liang meetings to solve them. In the design, on the one hand, they dared to think and act, boldly creating, and on the other hand, they meticulously collected information. Every day, people went to Tianjin Power Machine Factory, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and many other units to collect information, which made their design based on a reliable foundation.

Throughout the design work, they fully demonstrated the spirit of hard work and perseverance, sweating profusely for more than ten hours a day in the hot weather. Especially in the last few days, many students stayed at their drawing tables for several days and nights.

In fifteen days, they drew more than 1,300 drawings and designed this 3,000-horsepower free-piston gas turbine unit.

On the afternoon of July 30, Tsinghua University invited comrades from Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the Railway Science Research Institute, and the Power Research Office to hold a technical symposium. At the meeting, representatives from various units unanimously congratulated the success of the design, praised the Tsinghua University teachers and students for being both red and expert, and for being able to speak and act.

    培养敢想敢干的新知识分子
    清华大学师生完成自由活塞—燃气轮机机组设计
    本报讯　一台新颖的机车用三千马力自由活塞——燃气轮机机组的设计工作已经在7月29日完成了，这是清华大学动力系汽车拖拉机发动机专业与燃气轮机专业的教师和部分毕业班的学生，接受了长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的委托，在短短十五天的时间内完成的。
    设计工作一开始，清华大学设计工作组立刻就面临了各式各样的新问题，首先出现的就是设计思想的问题。当时在他们手中只有很少几张苏联图纸和一些照片，怎么来对待这些资料呢？大家是有着不同的想法的，有些同志想，既然这些资料很不全，那就不一定要学习这些设计；但是，有的同志认为，既然这是苏联同志经过了很长时间作出的设计，那么这个设计一定是先进的，合理的，应该认真学习这些资料，把它用到他们现在进行的设计中去。当设计工作组的党支部发现了这些情况后，立刻召开全体党员大会展开讨论。党支部支持后一种意见，并且及时地向全设计组提出：坚决学习苏联，钻研并体会这些苏联资料，把苏联的先进结构采用到设计中去。同时，党支部还提出要创造性地学习，结合国情地学习。全设计组的思想明确了，步调一致了，这就大大加快了设计工作的速度，设计质量也有了保证。
    在不同的阶段，设计工作组的党支部根据设计中产生的思想问题，提出新的方针。例如：在大家设计苏联资料中所没有的部件和零件时，党支部就提出：向生产实际学习，一定要选择经受过考验的结构。在这种设计思想指导下进行工作，就使整个设计的可靠性与现实性大大提高。他们所设计的燃气轮机的轴承装置，就采用了上海汽轮机厂所生产的轴承装置的结构形式，由于这种轴承装置已经经受过生产和使用的考验，就使整个设计的可靠性提高了。
    参加设计工作的共有九十九个人，其中只有十几个是教师，其他都是清华大学本届毕业班的学生，他们的平均年龄不满二十四岁。当时也有人想，这些年青人描描图或做些简单的设计工作还可以，至于要设计这样一台复杂的机器，那是不行的。可是，就是这些年青人，他们在这样一项艰巨复杂的任务面前毫不气馁。他们说：“我们是教学改革后在新的教学度制下培养出来的学生，受过生产劳动锻炼，参加过井冈山小汽车的设计，设计过自动底盘拖拉机，现在，我们在党的领导下，又要向尖端产品的设计进军了，我们一定能拿下这个堡垒。”就这样，他们发挥了集体力量，每一张总成图，都经过大家充分讨论，每画一张零件图，都经过几次互校，工作碰到困难的时候，他们就开诸葛亮会解决。他们在设计中，一方面是敢想敢作，大胆创造，一方面是极其认真地收集资料。他们每天都有人到天津动力机厂、北京航空学院等很多单位去收集资料，这样就使他们的设计建筑在可靠的基础上。
    在整个设计工作中，他们充分发挥了苦干实干的精神，在炎热的天气，每天汗流浃背地坚持工作十几小时。特别是最后几天，好多学生都是几昼夜不离图桌。
    在十五天中，他们一共画了一千三百多张图纸，把这台三千马力的自由活塞——燃气轮机机组设计了出来。
    在7月30日下午，清华大学邀请了长辛店机车车辆修理厂、铁道科学研究院、动力研究室等单位的同志举行了技术座谈会。会上各单位的代表一致祝贺这一设计的成功，赞扬清华大学师生的又红又专，能说会干。（黄鼎模）
