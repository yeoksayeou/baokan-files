Thirty-five male and female members of the cooperative participate in this Opera Research Institute, which is divided into four departments: instruments, creation, theatrical research, and material collection. Each department has a group leader, with the Communist Youth League branch secretary serving as the principal, and a theatrical affairs committee has been established.
