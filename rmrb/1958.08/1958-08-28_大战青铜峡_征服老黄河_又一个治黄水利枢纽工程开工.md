Great Battle of Qingtongxia, Conquer the Old Yellow River
Another Yellow River Water Conservancy Project Begins Construction
By 1960, it will have a power generation capacity of 260,000 kilowatts; the arid mountainous areas on both sides of the Yellow River for thousands of years will also be water conservancy areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 27th: Following the start of the Sanmenxia project, another large-scale Yellow River control project—the Yellow River Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Project—began construction on the 26th.

This water conservancy project is a comprehensive utilization water conservancy project that integrates power generation, irrigation, and regulation of the Yellow River's water volume. Its dam is 560 meters long and 42 meters high. Seven giant pier-style power stations will be built on the dam. By the time the entire project is completed in 1960, the power generation capacity of the power station can reach 260,000 kilowatts, which will greatly supply the needs of many newly built industrial bases and rural electrification in the Ningxia area. The dam can also control the ice flood of the Yellow River in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia and other regions, and enable the Ningxia region to form an irrigation network of 10 million acres of Yellow River Plain and a mountain pumping irrigation network. The arid mountainous areas on both sides of the Yellow River for thousands of years will also be water conservancy areas. The automatic gate of the dam will regulate the flood peak of the Yellow River, which can maintain the minimum flow of the Yellow River in the middle reaches and ensure the year-round navigation of steamships of 500 tons or more.

Yesterday, a mass rally of ten thousand people was held at the construction site to celebrate the start of construction. The venue was filled with bold slogans, showing people’s determination to "work hard for two and a half years, create a blessing for ten thousand years, fight the battle of Qingtongxia, build a good hydropower station, and build a good dam." Leading cadres from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau, as well as Wu Shengxiu, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, attended the commencement ceremony. Representatives of the people of all ethnic groups participating in the project construction presented letters of determination to the conference, guaranteeing the accelerated construction and early completion of the project. After the ground-breaking ceremony, powerful bulldozers extended their giant shovels and rolled up yellow soil. Then, the mountain blasting began, and a roar echoed in the canyon, and the entire construction site entered a boiling battle. (Attached picture)

　　大战青铜峡  征服老黄河
    又一个治黄水利枢纽工程开工
    到1960年，这里将拥有二十六万瓩发电能力；黄河两岸几千年干旱山区也将水利化
    据新华社银川27日电　继三门峡工程动工后，又一个规模浩大的治黄工程——黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程在26日开始动工兴建。
    这个水利工程是发电、灌溉、调节黄河水量等综合利用的水利枢纽工程。它的拦河大坝有五百六十公尺长，四十二公尺高，大坝上要兴修七个巨大直闸墩式发电站。到1960年全部工程竣工后，电站发电能力可以达到二十六万瓩，将大量地供应宁夏地区新建的许多工业基点和农村电气化的需要。大坝还可以控制宁夏、内蒙古等地区的黄河淩汛，并使宁夏地区形成面积一千万亩的黄河平原灌溉网和山区扬水灌溉网，黄河两岸几千年干旱的山区也将水利化。大坝的自动闸门，将调节黄河的洪峰，可以使黄河中游保持最低流量，保证五百吨以上汽船的常年通航。
    昨天，工地上举行了庆祝开工典礼万人大会。会场上到处是豪迈的标语，显示出人们“苦战两年半，开辟万年福，大战青铜峡，建好水电站，筑好拦河坝”的决心。水利电力部、三门峡工程局的负责干部，宁夏回族自治区筹备委员会副主任吴生秀等，都参加了开工典礼。参加工程建设的各族民工代表向大会献了决心书，保证工程的加速施工和提早完工。破土仪式后，威力强大的推土机伸出巨大的铲刀，卷起了黄色的土块。接着，炸山爆破开始了，峡谷里发出一片轰鸣，整个工地进入了沸腾的战斗。（附图片）
