Ten Women Smelt Iron

The All-China Women's Federation recently received a letter of good news about ten women smelting iron.

The letter reads as follows: We are ten female employees of the Commercial Bureau of Guangde County, Anhui Province. Through studying the General Line, we broke down superstitions and liberated our minds, using indigenous methods to build a "March 8th" iron smelting furnace. This iron smelting furnace has already started production on August 1st. Our iron smelting furnace's body is made of oil drums, the blower is replaced by hand-pulled bellows, the fuel is charcoal, and there is no mechanical equipment at all, but it has successfully smelted iron. We will continue to work hard to increase the quantity and quality of iron produced, and contribute our strength to the great leap forward in the motherland's great socialist construction.

The letter is signed by: Wang Zhizhen, Ma Shuxiu, Jie Boying, Wang Guizhen, Tang Cuizhen, Zhang Zengyi, Zhu Shundi, Wu Fengying, Yin Zhixiu, Yao Mingxiu. (Attached picture)

    十女炼铁
    全国妇联最近收到了一封十女炼铁的报喜信。
    这封信是这样写的：我们是安徽省广德县商业局的十名女职工。通过总路线的学习，我们破除迷信，解放了思想，利用土办法建成了一座“三八”炼铁炉。这座炼铁炉已经在8月1日开炉生产。我们的炼铁炉的炉身是用油桶做的，鼓风机是以手拉风箱代替的，燃料是木炭，全无机械设备，但是却成功地炼出了铁。我们将继续努力提高出铁的数量和质量，在祖国伟大的社会主义建设大跃进中贡献出我们一份力量。
    在这封信上签名的是：王芝珍，马书秀、解伯英，王桂珍，汤翠珍，张增怡，朱顺娣，吴凤英，殷志秀，姚明秀。（附图片）
