Editorial Notes

　  Prepare for Processing to Welcome the Bumper Harvest of Tubers
    The bumper harvest of tubers has brought new tasks to local industrial departments, which is to find every way to do a good job in processing.
    Is it possible for local industrial departments to undertake this task? The answer is yes. The equipment of tuber processing plants is generally simple, and the processing technology is relatively basic. As long as the staff of local industrial departments have a strong view of serving agricultural production, then the manufacture of processing machinery is not so difficult.
    Guizhou is a province with less developed industry, and in general, there are more difficulties in machine manufacturing. However, because the Party Committee promptly grasped this work and was determined to prepare to produce more than 200,000 processing machines in a very short period, it has prepared good conditions for tuber processing and storage. With this condition, all township and commune industries can set up processing plants.
    It is hoped that regions with a better industrial base will also quickly seize preparations to welcome the bumper harvest of tubers.

　  准备加工迎接薯类丰收
    薯类大丰收，给地方工业部门带来了新任务，这就是想一切办法做好加工工作。
    地方工业部门有没有可能承担这个任务呢？回答是肯定的。薯类加工厂一般的设备比较简陋，加工技术比较简单，只要地方工业部门工作人员具有坚强的为农业生产服务的观点，那末，加工机具的制造并不是怎么困难的。
    贵州是一个工业不很发达的省份，在机器制造方面一般说来困难是比较多些。但因为党委及时抓紧这一工作，决心在很短期间准备制出二十多万部加工机具，给薯类加工保管准备良好条件。有了这个条件，一切乡、社工业都可以办起加工厂来。
    希望工业基础较好的地区，也赶快抓紧准备，迎接薯类大丰收。
