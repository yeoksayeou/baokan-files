According to the Henan Daily: Guan Jieyi, the captain of the Guanzhuang Production Team of the Zhang Dazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Baoxin Township, Xixian County, Henan Province, cultivated 1.48 mu of pumpkins, which, after on-site inspection by Zhao Jianqi, the head of the agricultural technology station, and Chen Shiliang, an official from the Agricultural Bureau, yielded 300,048 jin of pumpkins, with an average yield of 202,735 jin per mu.

The main experiences for increasing production on this plot of land are: (1) Selecting a plot of land with a higher elevation for planting (because pumpkins do not like shade and are susceptible to waterlogging). (2) Early and deep plowing, meticulous land preparation. The previous crop on this land was vegetables. After harvesting the vegetables, it was deeply plowed to a depth of 8 inches. Before the ground froze, it was deeply plowed again to a depth of 1.6 feet. When the ground thawed in the spring, it was leveled and fertilized, then deeply dug again to a depth of 8 inches. Ten days before planting, it was deeply dug again. (3) Selecting superior varieties and conducting high-temperature seedling cultivation. (4) Planting at the appropriate time, with rational close planting. (5) Applying sufficient base fertilizer and topdressing in stages. (6) Removing side shoots, pressing vines, and strengthening field management.

    张大庄社南瓜亩产二十万斤
    据河南日报讯  河南息县包信乡张大庄农业社关庄生产队队长关杰义培植的一亩四分八厘南瓜，经农技站站长赵见器和农业局的干部陈世良等人实地验收，实收南瓜三十万零四十八斤，每亩平均单产二十万两千七百三十五斤。
    这块地的主要增产经验是：（一）选择地势较高的地块种植（因为南瓜不喜阴暗，又怕水淹）。（二）早耕深耕，精细整地。这块地前茬是菜地，收菜后深翻八寸；上冻前又深翻一遍，达一尺六寸深；开春解冻时耙平施肥，又深挖一遍，八寸深；在播种的前十天又深挖一遍。（三）选择优良品种，作好高温育苗。（四）适时栽培，合理密植。（五）施足底肥，分期施追肥。（六）打杈压蔓，加强田间管理。
