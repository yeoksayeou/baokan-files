There is no Flaming Mountain that cannot be crossed
By our reporter Chen Ji

　　"Ants Gnawing at Bones"

　　The first time I heard "ants gnawing at bones," I didn't know what it meant. A few days ago, I went to the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory and saw the scene of "ants gnawing at bones," and I understood that it was a revolutionary initiative in the machine tool manufacturing industry.

　　"Ants gnawing at bones" means using one or more small machine tools and special machine heads to process a large component simultaneously. Because the component is very large, the small machine tools moving around the large component appear very small, like a group of ants gnawing at a large bone. The workers gave this processing method a name called "ants gnawing at bones."

　　At the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory, I saw workers using this method to successfully manufacture China's first large-scale fertilizer equipment – a high-pressure nitrogen-hydrogen mixed gas compressor. This compressor, like a ring-shaped large iron house, occupied a piece of open space. Its interior was equipped with six large cylinders, two of which were as large as large bank vaults. Anyone who understands machine tool processing technology would think that such large cylinders must be processed by huge machine tools. However, standing in front of the factory building, I saw four small special boring heads, like wasps, crawling on the large cylinder, drilling into the belly of the large cylinder, and processing the large cylinder well. I stayed for a long time next to another large component of the compressor – the large body. This large body was 4.9 meters long, weighed more than 20,000 kilograms, and had a strange shape. Only two types of special indigenous machine tools were used to process this large body. One indigenous machine tool extended into the belly of the large body for processing; another indigenous machine tool was called a "tile-mouth milling machine," which could lie down, stand up, and perform four types of work: boring, milling, turning, and drilling. The most fascinating was a small machine tool called "satellites flying all over the sky," which could adapt to circumstances and move everywhere, sometimes climbing to the lower end of the large component, and sometimes stepping on the foot of the large component. It could also turn and mill, and was a flexible and versatile machine tool.

　　This whole set of special indigenous machine tools, totaling seven types and nineteen units, could replace nineteen regular, complex, heavy-duty machine tools. Relying on this set of special indigenous machine tools, a large compressor weighing 182 tons, which China had never manufactured before, was manufactured. Liu Ding, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, excitedly told me: With the experience of "ants gnawing at bones," we can not only manufacture large-scale fertilizer equipment, but also manufacture large-scale power generation and steel rolling equipment. We will also develop this method to solve the difficulties of thermal processing and use it to manufacture large-scale forging equipment. This is an important direction for accelerating the construction of the heavy machinery industry.

　　Two Opposing Views

　　At first, people didn't believe that small machine tools could make large equipment. Last winter, some people heard that the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory didn't have heavy-duty machine tools, and they thought: For such a factory to manufacture a large compressor weighing more than 180,000 kilograms, wouldn't that be like a toad wanting to eat swan meat? An engineer first proposed a list, requesting the factory to add a large number of heavy-duty floor-type boring machines, large vertical lathes, etc. He believed that only heavy-duty machine tools could make large compressors.

　　It would certainly be a good way to add a large number of heavy-duty machine tools. However, these heavy-duty machine tools could not be manufactured by domestic factories and had to be ordered from abroad. Ordering from abroad would require at least two years of waiting before they could enter the factory. If we had to wait for two years, how could we meet the urgent requirements of fertilizer plants being built rapidly everywhere? After research, the factory leaders decided to rely on the masses, rely on their own efforts, and solve the manufacturing problem of large compressors. They handed this problem over to the masses for discussion. Many old workers and cadres from worker backgrounds believed that small machine tools could be used to replace large machine tools. They explained from years of practical experience that the entire history of industrial product development has always been from small to large, from simple to complex; the large is developed from the small, and large machine tools were initially made from small machine tools. Therefore, using small machine tools to make large equipment is not only completely possible, but also in line with the laws of development of things. Some old workers also cited examples from their own factory's experience to prove this point. Some old workers and cadres also considered the characteristics of large compressors, which are large in volume and complex in shape, and proposed the idea of designing and manufacturing a whole set of small, special indigenous machine tools to process large components. Based on these opinions, the factory leaders decided to use small machine tools to manufacture large compressors, and immediately established a special organization to design and manufacture small, special indigenous machine tools.

　　The design was participated in by old workers and technicians. Workers who had been ridiculed as "uneducated" by people who were "highly skilled in technology" showed their talents in the design, providing many valuable opinions to solve the difficulties encountered in the design. Three types of special small boring machines and small milling machines were difficult to design; workers and technicians from worker backgrounds studied together and quickly designed them successfully. Now small special indigenous machine tools have exerted great power, processing large components and making large gas compressors. Those engineering and technical personnel who considered themselves to be theoretically high and did not believe in the wisdom of the working masses have also awakened and realized that practice is the source of knowledge.

　　Neither in Europe nor in Asia

　　With small special indigenous machine tools, the processing difficulties of large components were easily solved. However, how to cast the blanks of large components was once a big problem.

　　The equipment capacity of the casting workshop of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory was very small, and the floor space was not enough. The blank of a large component of a large compressor weighed more than 100,000 kilograms, and with the sand box, it weighed a total of 500,000 kilograms. In the past, only large castings weighing several thousand kilograms had been cast, and they were also scrapped. Now the workpiece is very large, and the production means are very small, so what should be done?

　　The factory leaders said: Ask the masses, and there will always be a way. The casting workshop held a symposium of old workers, aired their views, debated, and looked for solutions. After many debates, the problem of casting blanks for general components was solved, but the problem of casting large cylinders could not be solved. Some said: To cast large cylinders, the hoop casting method (stacking box method) must be used. However, other factories had used the hoop casting method to cast large cylinders, and two out of three were damaged. The old worker Zuo Junheng disagreed with this hoop casting method; he pondered for a long time and boldly proposed a new method called skin-splitting casting method. The engineer listened and was very surprised, saying: "There is no skin-splitting casting method in Europe, no skin-splitting casting method in Asia, no skin-splitting casting method in China, only our factory can come up with new tricks!" An old worker also said: "This is a method that was thought up on the kang, I have been a sand turner for decades and have never heard of this method." After many debates and repeated comparisons, most old workers agreed to use the skin-splitting casting method. The method was also supplemented in the debate. Finally, the leaders decided to use the skin-splitting casting method to cast large cylinders. Moreover, the quality of the large cylinder was very good, which was much better than the hoop casting method. At the same time, manufacturing large cylinders with the skin-splitting casting method was thirteen days faster than the hoop casting method. Soviet experts said: "This is an innovation of Chinese workers."

　　Using the skin-splitting casting method can certainly cast large cylinders quickly and well. However, to cast a large cylinder, 12 tons of molten iron must be poured at one time. The melting furnace in the casting workshop can only melt 5.5 tons of molten iron at a time, which cannot meet the requirements of the large cylinder. The workers came up with a method to store the molten iron in the insulated front furnace, which was fully loaded with 12 tons. However, the front furnace had never been loaded with 12 tons of molten iron. Because the pressure was too high, the molten iron suddenly spurted sparks from the outlet of the front furnace. The workers rushed to the molten iron of more than 1,000 degrees fearlessly, and stubbornly blocked the outlet with refractory clay, overcoming the difficulty of the small volume of the melting furnace. The large cylinder was very heavy, and together with the sand box, it weighed a total of 50 tons. The crane in the casting workshop could only lift 15 tons. How to lift the sand box containing the large cylinder? This was another big problem. The workers thought about it, concentrated their wisdom, and came up with a method: using this 15-ton crane, they only lifted one end of the large cylinder sand box and moved it forward; the other end was supported on the ground to reduce the burden on the crane. In this way, the large cylinder was turned over and lifted over before it was lifted out. The workers said: "Thousands of passes, thousands of passes, there is no Flaming Mountain that cannot be crossed!"

　　Yes, using the "ants gnawing at bones" method, the first large gas compressor in China was manufactured. What other Flaming Mountain in the world cannot be crossed?

　　没有跨不过的火焰山

    “蚂蚁啃骨头”
    初次听到“蚂蚁啃骨头”，还不知道是什么回事。前几天，到东北机器制造厂看了看，蚂蚁啃骨头”的景象，才懂得它是机床制造工业的一个革命创举。
      “蚂蚁啃骨头”，就是运用一台或多台小机床、专用机头，同时对一个大部件进行加工。因为部件很大，在大部件周围活动的小机床就显得很小巧，好像是一群蚂蚁在啃一块大骨头。工人们给这种加工方法，取了个名字，叫做“蚂蚁啃骨头”。
    我在东北机器制造厂，看到工人们运用这种方法，刚刚制造成功的我国第一台大型化肥设备——高压氮氢混合气体压缩机。这台压缩机像环状的大铁房那样，占据了一片空地。它的内部装着六个大汽缸，其中两个大汽缸像银行里的大保险柜那样大，任何懂得机床加工技术的人们，一听说这样大的汽缸，都认为是巨大的机床加工的。但是，我站在厂房门前，就看见：四个小小的专用镗头，像黄蜂似地爬在大汽缸身上，钻进大汽缸的肚子里，把大气缸加工好了。我在压缩机的另外一个大部件——大机身的旁边停留很久。这个大机身长达四公尺九，有两万多斤重，形状古怪。加工这个大机身的，只有两种专用土机床。一台土机床，伸进大机身的腹部去加工；另一台土机床叫“瓦口铣”，它能卧、能立，又能做镗、铣、车、钻四种工作。最引人入胜的是一台名叫“卫星满天飞”的小机床，它能随机应变，到处活动，时而爬到大部件的下端，时而又蹬在大部件的脚下。它又能旋、又能铣，是个灵巧的万能机床。
    这一整套专用土机床，共有七种十九台，能代替十九台正规的复杂的重型机床。依靠这套专用土机床，就把我国过去没有制造过的重达一百八十二吨大型压缩机制造出来了。第一机械工业部刘鼎副部长很兴奋地告诉我：我们有了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的经验，不但能制造大型化肥设备，而且能制造大型发电、轧钢设备。我们还要发展这个方法，来解决热加工的困难，用来制造大型锻压设备。这是加快重型机械工业建设的一个重要方向。
      两种相反的看法
    起初人们不大相信小机床能够做出大设备。去年冬天，有些人听说东北机器制造厂没有重型机床，就认为：这样的工厂要制造十八万多公斤重的大型压缩机，岂不是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉？有位工程师首先提出一个清单，要求工厂添置一大批重型的落地镗床、大立车等。他认为：只有重型机床才能做出大型压缩机。
    能添置一大批重型机床，那当然是个好办法。但是，这些重型机床，国内工厂不能制造，还得向国外定货。要向国外定货，至少要等待两年时间才能进厂。假如要等上两年时间，又怎么能满足各地飞跃建设化肥厂的迫切要求呢？工厂领导人员经过研究后，下决心依靠群众，自力更生，解决大型压缩机的制造问题。他们把这个问题交给群众讨论。许多老工人和工人出身的干部，都认为可以用小机床代替大机床，他们从多年实践的经验说明：整个工业产品发展史，从来都是由小到大，由简单到复杂；大的是从小的发展起来的，大机床最初也是由小机床做出来的。因此，用小机床做大设备，不但是完全可能的，而且是合乎事物发展规律的。有些老工人还举出本厂经历过的事例，来证明这个道理。有些老工人和干部还考虑到大型压缩机体积庞大、形状复杂的特点，提出自行设计和制造一整套小型的专用土机床来加工大部件的主张。工厂领导方面根据这些意见，决定用小机床来制造大型压缩机，并且马上建立了专门机构，来设计和制造小型的专用土机床。
    参加设计的有老工人和技术人员，曾经被“技术很高”的人讥笑为“没知识”的工人们在设计中大显身手，他们提供很多宝贵的意见，来解决设计中碰到的困难。有三种专用的小搪床、小铣床，很难设计；工人们和工人出身的技术员一起研究，很快就设计成功。现在小型的专用土机床，都发挥了巨大的威力，加工出大部件，制成大型气体压缩机。那些自认为理论高的、不相信工人群众智慧的工程技术人员，也都觉悟过来，认识到实践是知识的源泉。
    欧洲、亚洲都没有
    有了小型的专用土机床，大部件的加工困难就迎刃而解了。但是，大部件的毛胚怎么铸造出来，曾经是个很大的难题。
    东北机器制造厂的铸造车间的设备能力很小，场地面积又不够用。大型压缩机的一个大部件的毛胚，重达十几万公斤，加上砂箱，总有五十万公斤重。过去只铸造过几千公斤重的大铸件，还铸废了，现在工作物很大，生产手段很小，怎么办呢？
    工厂领导人员说：问问群众，总有办法。铸造车间召开老工人座谈会，鸣放辩论，寻找办法。辩论多次，一般部件的毛胚铸造问题都解决了，只有大汽缸的铸造问题解决不了。有的说：要铸造大汽缸，还得要用套圈铸造法（叠箱法）。但是，别的工厂用过套圈铸造法，铸造大汽缸，三个就坏了两个。老工人左俊恒不同意这个套圈铸造法；他捉摸很久，大胆提出个新方法，叫做裂皮铸造法。工程师听了，很惊疑，说道：“裂皮铸造法，欧洲没有，亚洲没有，中国也没有，就我们厂好出新花样！”有个老工人也说：“这是坐在炕头上硬想出的办法，我当过几十年翻砂匠也没听过这种方法。”经过多次辩论和反复比较，多数老工人都同意用裂皮铸造法。在辩论中又补充了这个方法。最后领导决定采用裂皮铸造法浇铸大汽缸。而且大汽缸的质量很好，比套圈铸造法优越得多。同时，用裂皮铸造法制造大汽缸，要比套圈铸造法快十三天。苏联专家说：“这是中国工人的一个创举。”
    用裂皮铸造法，固然可以又快又好地浇铸出大汽缸。但是，浇铸一个大汽缸，要一次浇上十二吨铁水。铸造车间的化铁炉一次只能熔化五吨半铁水，满足不了大汽缸的要求。工人们想出办法，把熔好的铁水装在保温的前炉里面，足足装满了十二吨。可是，前炉没装过十二吨铁水，因为压力太大，铁水忽然由前炉的出水口喷出火花。工人们奋不顾身，向着一千多度的铁水奔去，硬用耐火土把出水口堵住，战胜了化铁炉容积小的困难。大汽缸很重，连同沙箱，共有五十吨重。铸造车间的吊车只能吊十五吨重。怎么能把装着大汽缸的沙箱吊起来？又是一大难题。工人们左思右想，集中智慧，想出个办法：用这个十五吨的吊车，只吊大汽缸沙箱的一端，向前移动；另一端支在地上，减轻吊车的负担。这样把大汽缸翻过来，吊过去，才吊了出去。工人们说：“千重关，万重关，没有过不去的火焰山！”
    是的，用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法，制造出我国第一台大型气体压缩机，世界上还有什么火焰山不能跨过呢？
