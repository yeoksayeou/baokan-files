	The Zhejiang Forestry Science Institute has successfully experimented with extracting glucose from sawdust.

	Currently in China, glucose is mainly extracted from starch. The raw material for Zhejiang's experimental extraction of glucose is cedar sawdust. From every hundred catties (approximately 50kg) of net dry sawdust, through hydrolysis, neutralization, concentration, crystallization, and separation processes, twenty catties of glucose can be obtained. The sweetness and color of the resulting sugar crystals are similar to those of commercially available oral glucose crystals.

　　锯木屑制葡萄糖
    浙江林业科学研究所用锯木屑提制葡萄糖的试验已经成功。
    目前在我国葡萄糖主要从淀粉中提制。浙江实验提制葡萄糖的原料是杉木锯屑，每百斤净干锯木屑，通过水解、中和、浓缩、结晶和分离等操作过程，可得葡萄糖二十斤，所得糖的结晶的甜味和色泽都和市上出售的口服葡萄糖结晶相似。
