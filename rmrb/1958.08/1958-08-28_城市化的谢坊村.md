　　Urbanizing Xiefang Village
　　Bo Wei
    After spending a few days in Xushui County, Hebei, one prominent impression I have is that the countryside is urbanizing, and the gap between urban and rural areas is rapidly disappearing. I visited a village called Xiefang Village, about fifteen li from Xushui County. This village of 310 households used to be a feudal stronghold, with almost everything belonging to the two landlords surnamed Qi. People used to say that this village was poor and dirty. But now the appearance of this village has completely changed. Walking into this village is like walking into a world of poetry and painting, with poems and brightly colored paintings on almost every wall. Every street is smooth and clean, and on a main street, people are installing streetlights. The day I went, I saw several farmers decorating a newly built small house at an intersection, with green painted doors and windows, snow-white walls, and a landscape painting on the wall. I guessed that this beautiful little house was probably going to be used as a small shop or a health clinic? But later, after inquiring, I found out that it was a public toilet! This new type of village is much more beautiful than the dilapidated buildings and narrow, winding streets of Xushui City. There are two sizable pig farms in the village. People have to step on sacks soaked in disinfectant to sanitize their shoes before entering, and you can't smell any pig manure near any of the pigsties. Xiefang Village is a people's commune. It has its own flour mill, power plant (two one-horsepower generators driven by locomotive boilers), sewing factory, shop, health clinic, kindergarten, nursery, Red and Expert University, club, public canteen, public bathhouse, and barbershop. Which aspect of this isn't like a city? All this tells people that the distance between farmers and urban residents in terms of production and life has been greatly shortened, and will be shortened even faster in the future.
    Another feeling is that the organization and discipline of the peasants are being strengthened as never before. Whether it's day or night, at the sound of a whistle, the commune members quickly gather together, and their actions are very swift. Since most of the means of livelihood have been collectivized, and housework has been collectivized, the labor force has been further liberated. For today's countryside, one cannot only see the side of extremely tense labor, but also the side of not being tense, that is, people are free from the burden of children, stoves, and private plots, their spirits are unburdened, and they are also carefree in their spare time. In this respect, I feel that urban life, especially the life of office workers, is far behind the countryside.

　　城市化的谢坊村
　　勃伟
    到河北徐水县看了几天，有一个突出的印象，就是农村正在城市化，城乡差别正在迅速消灭。我到过离徐水县城十五里的一个村庄——谢坊村。这座三百一十户的村庄过去是个封建堡垒，几乎村中的一切都属姓齐的两家大地主。人们都说这个村子又穷又脏。可是现在这个村子的面貌完全翻了个过儿。走进这座村庄，就像走进一个诗和画的世界，几乎每一面墙壁上都有诗歌和色彩鲜艳的画。每一条街道都修得平坦整洁，一段主要街道上，人们正在装路灯。我去的那天，看见几个农民正在一个十字路口修饰一所刚建成的小房子，绿漆的门窗，雪白的墙壁，墙面还有一幅风景画。我猜想这所漂亮的小房子大概是要用来做小商店或者卫生所什么的吧？可是后来一打听，原来是座公共厕所！这座新型的村庄，比起建筑破旧、街道狭窄曲折的徐水城要美得多。村里有两处规模不小的养猪场，人们要在门口踏在药水浸过的麻袋片上把鞋底消毒才能进去，走近任何一处猪舍前都闻不到一点猪粪的臭味。谢坊村是一个人民公社，它拥有自己的磨面厂、发电厂（两台由锅驼机带动的一马力的发电机）、缝纫厂、商店、卫生所、幼儿园、托儿所、红专大学、俱乐部、公共食堂、公共浴室和理发室。这里哪一点不像城市？这一切都告诉人们：农民和城市居民在生产上、生活上的距离，已经大大缩短了，今后还要更快地缩短。
    还有另一个感觉，就是农民的组织性、纪律性正在空前地加强。不论白天或夜晚，一声哨子响，社员们很快就集合起来，行动十分迅速。由于绝大部分生活资料都公有化了，家务劳动集体化了，劳动力进一步解放了。对于今日的农村，不能光看劳动十分紧张的一面，还要看到不紧张的一面，那就是人们都摆脱孩子、锅台、自留地的牵累，精神毫无负担，劳动之余，也逍遥自在。在这方面，我倒感到城市生活，特别是机关工作人员的生活，是远远落在农村的后面了。
