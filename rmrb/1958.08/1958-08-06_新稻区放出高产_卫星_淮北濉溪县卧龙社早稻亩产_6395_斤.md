Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 4th. A double-cropping early rice "satellite" has been launched from the Wolong Cooperative in Suixi County, Huaibei Province, a new rice-growing area converted from dry land. The 1.13 mu of "503" early rice cultivated by the Luo Quanzhen team of this cooperative yielded a total of 7,227 jin of dry grain, averaging 6,395 jin per mu.

	The soil in this field is black mud, and the terrain is low-lying, often suffering from disasters in the past, yielding only dozens of jin of grain per mu. In 1955, a year of great harvest, the sorghum planted yielded only 48 jin per mu. Local people described it as: "Wolong Lake, it's really pitiful, a toad's pee floods a large area, if it doesn't rain for seven days, the dry land smokes, nine out of ten years there's no harvest, and in the year there is a harvest, the wheat harvest is only a 'dou' or two, and we don't see each other after autumn." After liberation, the Party led the local people in a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. Last year, they switched to planting rice and achieved a bumper harvest. In the high tide of water conservancy last winter and this spring, the area basically achieved river networkization, and double-cropping early rice was tried here for the first time. Conservatives and skeptics believed that this place was not like the south of the Yangtze River, and there was no hope for growing rice, let alone double-cropping rice. They said that double-cropping rice could not cross the Huai River. Now, the iron facts prove that double-cropping rice can not only cross the north of the Huai River, but also achieve a miracle of more than 6,000 jin per mu in the area of 34 degrees north latitude. It also proves that under the leadership of the Party, Huaibei, after realizing river networkization, will not only catch up with the south of the Yangtze River, but also keep pace with the south of the Yangtze River and increase agricultural production.

	When this high-yield field was harvested on July 30, there were more than 50 people supervising the harvesting and threshing, including Xu Caiwen, the first secretary of the Suixi County Party Committee, and the secretaries of the district and township Party committees. (Attached picture)

    新稻区放出高产“卫星”
    淮北濉溪县卧龙社早稻亩产6395斤
    据新华社合肥4日电　从旱田改水田的新稻区安徽省濉溪县卧龙社里射出了一颗双季早稻卫星。这个社罗全珍队培养的一亩一分三厘
  “五○三”早稻，共收干谷七千二百二十七斤，平均亩产六千三百九十五斤。
    这块田土质是黑泥土，地势低洼，往年经常受灾，每亩只收几十斤粮食，在1955年大丰收年种的高粱，亩产只有四十八斤。当地群众形容说：“卧龙湖，真可怜，蛤蟆撒泡尿，淹了一大片，七天不下雨，旱的地冒烟，十年九不收，一年有收，麦收斗把斗，秋后不见面。”解放后，党领导当地人民和自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，去年改种了水稻获得了丰收，去冬今春在水利高潮中，这里基本上实现了河网化，便第一次在这里试种双季早稻。保守派和怀疑派认为这个地方不比江南，种水稻没有希望，种双季稻更是胡闹。他们说双季稻不能过淮河。现在，铁的事实证明，双季稻不仅可以跨过淮河以北，而且可以在北纬三十四度的地区，取得亩产六千多斤的奇迹。它还证明淮北在党的领导下，实现河网化以后，不但能够赶上江南，而且将和江南并驾齐驱，提高农业产量。
    这块丰产田在7月30日收割时，有中共濉溪县委第一书记许彩文和区乡党委书记等五十多人监收监打。（附图片）
