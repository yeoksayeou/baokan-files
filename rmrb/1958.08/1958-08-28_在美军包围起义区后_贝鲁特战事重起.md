Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, Beirut Dispatch: After the US invading forces openly surrounded the rebel-held areas within the Lebanese capital and occupied the approximately six-kilometer-long highway in the southern suburbs leading to the international airport, long-dormant fighting between Lebanese rebels and Chamoun's forces erupted again yesterday.

Yesterday evening, supporters of Chamoun's National Social Party first provoked the rebels near the highway leading to the airport. The rebels counterattacked, and a fierce gun battle immediately ensued. Government troops also joined the battle, firing on the rebels with armored vehicles, cannons, and machine guns. A Canadian sergeant belonging to the liaison group of the United Nations Emergency Force stationed in Gaza (in the United Arab Republic) was seriously injured on the spot and died after being sent to an American hospital. In addition, in the Shatila district south of Beirut, rebels also engaged in fighting with Chamoun's security forces. Both sides suffered casualties.

The American invading forces surrounding the Basta district, which is controlled by Lebanese rebels, continue to build fortifications, stacking sandbags and erecting barbed wire, so that they can directly fire into the district. American soldiers, hiding behind American tanks and fortifications with their gun barrels aimed at the rebel area, are wearing "bulletproof vests."

　　在美军包围起义区后
    贝鲁特战事重起
    新华社27日讯　贝鲁特消息：在美国侵略军公然包围黎巴嫩首都市内起义者的控制区和占领南郊通往国际机场的长约六公里的公路以后，沉寂多时的黎巴嫩起义者和夏蒙部队之间的战斗昨天又爆发。
    昨天晚上，支持夏蒙的国家社会党徒首先在通往机场的公路附近向起义者挑衅，起义者予以反击，当即发生激烈枪战。政府军也参加战斗，他们用装甲车、大炮和机关枪向起义者开火。属于联合国驻加沙（在阿拉伯联合共和国）紧急部队联络组的一名加拿大军士当场受重伤，送到美国医院后毙命。另外在贝鲁特南面的沙提拉区，起义者也同夏蒙保安队发生了战斗。双方均有死伤。
    包围黎巴嫩起义者控制的巴斯塔区的美国侵略军继续在修筑工事，垒上沙包和围起铁丝网，以便能够向这区内直接射击。躲在炮口对准起义区的美军坦克和工事后面的美军士兵都穿上了“避弹衣”。
