Wuqing County Prepares to Immediately Promote Electric Plows

(Our dispatch) The performance of the electric cable-traction plow in cultivation in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, has aroused great interest among the masses in the county. They are actively creating conditions to use electric plows for cultivation throughout the county.

On the 2nd, all cadres of county-level organs visited the electric plow performance hosted by the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences at the Eight-Hole Sluice. Subsequently, the county party committee arranged for promotion throughout the county. An electric plow training class was held on the 7th, and more than one hundred students (graduates of senior elementary school) have already learned to master the operating technology of the electric plow and are now continuing to study the disassembly and installation of electric plows. On the 11th, the county's iron factory had already copied the first electric plow. After field testing, it will be manufactured in large quantities. After several days of efforts, teachers and students of the county's Normal College have produced an automatic electronic clutch for controlling the electric plow. When our editorial department spoke with the Wuqing County Party Committee Office by telephone at 5:00 p.m. on the 12th, the team from the college reporting the good news to the county party committee had just left not long ago.

The county committee has decided to first conduct an electric plow cultivation experimental area in Jiaodao Wa, and is now actively preparing to send electricity to this area.

　　武清县准备立即推广电犁
    本报讯　电力绳索牵引犁在河北武清县进行耕作表演，引起了该县广大群众极大的兴趣，他们正积极创造条件，准备在全县用电犁耕作。
    2日，县级机关全体干部都在八孔闸参观了中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所主持的电犁表演。接着县委就布置要全县推广，电犁训练班已在7日举办，一百多个学员（高小毕业生）已经学会了掌握电犁的操作技术，现正在继续学习电犁的拆卸和安装工作。11日，县里的铁工厂已仿制出第一部电犁，经过田间试验，就将大量制造。该县师范学院师生经过几天的努力，已经制成了操纵电犁的自动电子离合器。当本报编辑部在12日下午五时同武清县委办公室通电话时，该院向县委报喜的队伍刚离去不久。
    县委会决定在夹道洼首先搞电犁耕作试验区，现在正积极准备往这个地区送电。
