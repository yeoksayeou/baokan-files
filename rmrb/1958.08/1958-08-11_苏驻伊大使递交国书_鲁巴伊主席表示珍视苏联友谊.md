Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 9th (TASS): The Soviet Union's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Iraq, Mr. Zaitsev, presented his credentials to the Chairman of the Supreme Sovereignty Council of the Republic of Iraq, Mr. Rubai, on August 9th. Present at the occasion were Supreme Sovereignty Council members Mr. Kuba and Mr. Nakshabandi, as well as Iraqi Foreign Minister Mr. Jamal.

In his address during the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Zaitsev emphasized that the Soviet people harbor sincere sympathy and friendly feelings towards the freedom-loving Iraqi people. The Soviet people congratulate the Iraqi people on the victories they have achieved in the struggle against colonialism and for consolidating national independence.

Zaitsev said that the Soviet government, adhering to a policy of peace and the principles of friendship among all peoples, and recognizing the right of all peoples to self-determination, including the right of each nation to determine its own form of government, immediately recognized the Republic of Iraq after its establishment and extended a hand of friendship to the Iraqi people.

Zaitsev pointed out that the Soviet Union is a loyal and reliable friend of the Iraqi people and the Republic of Iraq established according to the will of the Iraqi people. The Soviet Union seeks no privileges for itself and pursues no selfish goals, because this would violate the policies of a socialist country.

They cherish and welcome the heroic spirit and good wishes of the Soviet people. They welcome the Soviet government's unwavering adherence to a policy of peace and the principle of friendship with peace-loving countries, as well as its recognition of the right of all peoples to self-determination, and thank the Soviet government for its prompt recognition of the Republic of Iraq.

Rubai said to Zaitsev, "I am pleased to hear you say that the Soviet Union holds only sincere friendship and seeks no privileges for itself, nor does it pursue any selfish goals, which the Iraqi people are resolutely opposed to." Rubai wished for the continuous strengthening of genuine friendship and peaceful cooperation between the Republic of Iraq and the Soviet Union.
