Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The United States' conspiracy to create tension in the Far East has aroused the public anger of people around the world. Newspapers in various countries have published commentaries condemning the provocative activities of the United States.

    Czech "Red Rights Daily":
    Dulles Brought the Flames of War from the Middle East to the Far East

    The "Red Rights Daily" published a commentary on the 27th, condemning the United States' recent intensified provocations against China. The commentary pointed out that the United States' activities in the Taiwan Strait have been acts of aggression from the very beginning, and the whole world should condemn them.

    The newspaper pointed out that Dulles's trick of bringing the flames of war from the Middle East to the Far East has been universally opposed. The provocative actions of the United States in the Taiwan Strait region highlight the instability of the situation in this region. The Americans have rudely violated international law in this region and implemented the worst form of colonialism.

    The newspaper concluded that the world must immediately demand that the American interventionists finally get out of the Taiwan Strait region.

    "Free Romania Daily":
    The Chinese People Will Give the Aggressors a Devastating Blow

    The "Free Romania Daily" published a commentary on the 27th, condemning the new provocative actions of the United States in Asia. The commentary pointed out that if the United States takes new adventurous actions in this region, it will suffer new blows, just as it did when it attempted to enslave the Arab people.

    The commentary pointed out that the facts show that the United States is actively creating tension in Southeast Asia, especially stepping up preparations for new war adventures in the Taiwan region. The events clearly show that American imperialism must bear full responsibility for the tension in the Taiwan region.

    The commentary said that undoubtedly, the People's Republic of China will never ignore the aggressive actions of the United States. The Chinese people, who have been liberated and are building a bright future, will give the aggressors a devastating blow.

    "Neues Deutschland":
　　The United States Provokes Six Hundred Million Chinese People

    "Neues Deutschland" published a commentary on the 26th, fiercely condemning the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique for provoking six hundred million Chinese people and plotting to create tension in the Far East. The commentary pointed out that in recent days, American-made jet Chiang planes have constantly provoked the peaceful Chinese people. The commentary emphasized that the provocative actions of the US-Chiang clique in the Taiwan region this time have exceeded the scale of any previous one. Therefore, people cannot but believe that this is a large-scale conspiracy with a certain purpose to create new tension.

    On the same day, the "Berliner Zeitung" also published a commentary entitled "Madman Policy," severely criticizing the provocative actions of the United States in creating tension in the Far East.

    Polish "People's Tribune":
    American Military Demonstrations Poison the International Atmosphere

    The "People's Tribune" pointed out in a commentary on the 27th that the incidents caused by the provocative actions of the Chiang Kai-shek army in the Taiwan Strait once again illustrate to world opinion the fact that the unresolved Taiwan issue, that is, the United States' support for the puppet regime entrenched on this Chinese island, is the root cause of unrest and tension in the Far East.

    The commentary said that it is very noteworthy that the intensification of the situation in the Taiwan Strait almost coincided with the landing of American troops in Singapore. The United States' persistent refusal to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the Security Council, a policy that ignores the Chinese people, as well as military demonstrations in the Taiwan Strait and Singapore, have created tension in the Far East and poisoned the entire international atmosphere. Especially after the United Nations passed the joint proposal of Arab countries and the Geneva technical experts meeting on studying methods of detecting nuclear explosions adopted recommendations, these activities should be criticized even more when there is a possibility of some easing of international tension.

    Bulgarian "Agricultural Banner Newspaper":
　　The United States Must Be Stopped from Setting Fires in the Far East

    The "Agricultural Banner Newspaper" published a commentary on the 28th, condemning the shameless slander of American imperialism against China. The commentary emphasized that it is the American aggressors who are threatening peace in Asia, not others.

    The commentary pointed out that the United States has "voluntarily" committed crimes for this purpose and has just been judged for invading Lebanon. However, it still shouts wildly that China "threatens" peace in Asia.

    The commentary said that the policies of the US State Department and the dangerous actions of the US armed forces near Taiwan and Singapore have caused serious unease and have been condemned by most countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

    The commentary concluded that the time has come to stop these "madmen" because these people stubbornly refuse to see and acknowledge the truth, and also want to start a new war in the Far East.

    Cairo "Al Misaa"
    The US Occupation of Taiwan is an Open Provocation to World Peace

    The Cairo "Al Misaa" published an article on the 27th saying that the US occupation of Taiwan and keeping Chiang Kai-shek there is a constant threat to China and an open provocation to peace-loving people all over the world, and undermines world peace. This American puppet's occupation of China's seat in the United Nations also prevents the United Nations from playing its role in maintaining world peace.

    The article went on to point out that the failure of imperialism in the Middle East, the economic crisis in the United States, and the upcoming United Nations General Assembly are the three direct factors that prompted the United States and its agent, Chiang Kai-shek, to provoke China. The author explained that the failure of imperialism in the Middle East has forced the United States to reinforce other strategic locations to make up for its losses and further tightly control the areas in the Far East that are still under its control; the increasingly deepening economic crisis makes the "limited war" policy that constitutes the main part of US foreign policy more necessary now than ever before. American big businesses once hoped that the recent tension in the Middle East would turn into a "limited war" to stimulate the US market; the United States is afraid of the results of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly debate on the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    The article finally warned the United States that, due to the establishment of peaceful relations with all peace-loving countries, the firm support for the struggle for freedom around the world, and its growing position as a powerful major peaceful force, People's China is gaining greater respect from the people of the world every moment. Regardless of whether the United States is willing or not, the development of the situation will bring China to the United Nations.

    Damascus "Al Nasr"
    Knock Out the American Pistol Pointing at the Heart of China

    Damascus "Al Nasr" published an editorial on the 27th saying: "The sudden tension on the Chinese seas is just a further exacerbation of the already serious situation. To eliminate this serious situation, it is only necessary to knock out the American pistol pointing at the heart of China from Taiwan and the coastal islands of mainland China."

    The newspaper said: People's China is a big country, it will never allow part of its territory to be occupied, allow atomic bases to point to its heart, ignore its international status, or turn a blind eye to attempts to strengthen the corrupt regime on its people.

    The newspaper said: "The Chinese people are humane and noble people. They have a rich culture, a long history, and national pride. All of this will become more profound and more solid with the development of the world. They are building a brand-new society, realizing the mission of mankind, and playing a huge role in the worldwide efforts to create peace and crush imperialism." The newspaper said: The United States is not provoking an easily intimidated and isolated small country, but is provoking a powerful country, roaring at the sea of people that can swallow all kinds of stupid behavior.

　　美国在台湾海峡制造乌云  各国舆论谴责侵略者挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国在远东制造紧张局势的阴谋，引起了世界人民的公愤，各国报刊纷纷发表评论，谴责美国的挑衅活动。
    捷“红色权利报”
    杜勒斯把战火从中东带到远东
    “红色权利报”27日发表评论，谴责美国最近加紧对中国的挑衅活动。评论指出，美国在台湾海峡的活动从一开始就是罪恶昭彰的侵略行为，全世界应当予以谴责。
    报纸指出，杜勒斯把战火从中东带到远东的诡计遭到了普遍反对，美国在台湾海峡地区的挑衅行动着重说明了这个地区局势的不稳定，美国人在这个地区粗暴地破坏了国际法，并且执行最坏的一种殖民主义。
    报纸最后说，全世界必须刻不容缓地要求美国干涉者最后滚出台湾海峡地区。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”
    中国人民将会给侵略者以毁灭性打击
    “自由罗马尼亚报”27日发表评论，谴责美国在亚洲地区的新的挑衅行为。评论指出，如果美国在这一地区采取新的冒险行动，它将会遭到新的打击，像它在企图奴役阿拉伯人民时所遭遇的一样。
    评论指出，事实表明，美国正在东南亚积极制造紧张局势，特别是加紧准备在台湾地区进行新的战争冒险。事件清楚地表明，美国帝国主义要对台湾地区的紧张局势负全部责任。
    评论说，无疑地，中华人民共和国对美国的侵略行为绝不会置之不理，已经获得解放并且正在建设着美好未来的中国人民，将会给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    “新德意志报”
　　美国向六亿中国人民挑衅
    “新德意志报”26日发表评论，猛烈谴责美国和蒋介石集团向六亿中国人民进行挑衅，阴谋在远东制造紧张局势。评论指出，连日来美制喷气式蒋机不断向和平的中国人民寻衅。评论强调说，美蒋集团这一次在台湾地区的挑衅行为超过了以往任何一次的规模，因此人们不能不认为这是一种大规模的、具有一定目的的制造新的紧张局势的阴谋。
    同一天“柏林日报”也以“狂人政策”为题发表评论，痛斥美国在远东制造紧张局势的挑衅行为。
     波“人民论坛报”
    美国军事示威毒化国际气氛
    “人民论坛报”27日在一篇评论中指出，蒋介石军队的挑衅行动在台湾海峡所引起的事件再一次向世界舆论说明了一个事实：悬而未决的台湾问题，即美国支持盘踞在这个中国岛屿上的傀儡政权，是远东局势不宁静和紧张的根源。
    评论说，非常值得注意的是，台湾海峡局势的加紧几乎是同美国军队在新加坡登陆同时发生的。美国所执行的顽固拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国和安全理事会中的合法席位的这种忽视人民中国的政策，以及在台湾海峡和新加坡的军事示威，造成了远东的紧张局势并且毒化了整个国际气氛。特别是在联合国通过阿拉伯国家联合提案、研究侦察核爆炸方法的日内瓦技术专家会议通过建议以后，在国际紧张局势有了某种缓和的可能性的时候，这些活动就更应当受到抨击。
    保“农业旗帜报”
　　必须制止美国在远东放火
    “农业旗帜报”28日发表评论，谴责美国帝国主义对中国的无耻诬蔑。评论着重说，威胁着亚洲和平的正是美国侵略者，而不是别人。
    评论指出，美国为此“主动”地犯下了罪行并且由于侵略黎巴嫩而刚刚遭到判决，然而它竟仍然狂叫中国“威胁”着亚洲和平。
    评论说，美国国务院的政策和美国武装部队在台湾和新加坡附近的危险行动引起了人们严重的不安，并且受到亚洲、非洲和欧洲大多数国家的谴责。
    评论最后说，必须制止这些“疯子”的时候已经来到了，因为这些人顽固地不愿意看见和承认真理，而且还想在远东烧起新的战火。
    开罗“晚报”
    美国霸占台湾是对世界和平的公开挑衅
    开罗“晚报”27日发表文章说，美国霸占台湾和使蒋介石留在那里，是对中国的经常性的威胁，同时也是对全世界爱好和平人民的公开挑衅，并且破坏世界和平。这个美国傀儡占据中国在联合国的席位还妨碍着联合国发挥它维护世界和平的作用。
    文章接着指出，帝国主义在中东的失败、美国的经济危机和即将到来的联合国大会是促使美国及其代理人蒋介石对中国进行挑衅的三个直接因素。作者阐述说，帝国主义在中东的失败，迫使美国不得不增援其他的战略地点以弥补它的损失，并且进而牢牢控制还在它支配之下的远东的地区；愈来愈深刻的经济危机使构成美国外交政策主要部分的“有限战争”政策现在比过去任何时候都更必要了，美国的大企业曾经希望最近中东的紧张局势会变成一场“有限战争”来刺激美国的市场；美国害怕即将到来的联合国大会有关恢复中国在联合国合法席位问题辩论的结果。
    文章最后警告美国说，人民中国由于同所有爱好和平的国家建立了和平的关系，坚定地支持世界各地争取自由的斗争，以及它作为一个强大的主要和平力量的地位日益加强，它正每时每刻地取得全世界人民更大的尊敬，不管美国愿意不愿意，形势的发展将会使中国到联合国中来。
    大马士革“胜利报”
    打掉指向中国心脏的美国手枪
    大马士革“胜利报”27日发表社论说：“在中国海面突然引起的紧张局势只是一直严重的局势进一步加剧而已，要消除这种严重局势只有打掉从台湾以及中国大陆沿海岛屿指向中国心脏的美国手枪。”
    报纸说：人民中国是一个大国，它决不会听凭它的部分领土被占领、听凭原子基地指向它的心脏、不顾它的国际地位或对把腐败的政权加强于它的人民的企图熟视无睹。
    报纸说：“中国人民是人道的、崇高的人民，他们有着丰富的文化、悠久的历史和民族自豪感，这一切将随着世界的发展而更加深刻和更加牢固。他们正在建设着崭新的社会、实现着人类的使命，并且在缔造和平和粉碎帝国主义的全世界努力中起着巨大的作用”。报纸说：美国并不是在对一个易被吓倒的孤立的小国人民进行挑衅，而是在对一个拥有实力的大国进行挑衅，是在对能够吞没各种愚蠢行为的人的大海咆哮。
