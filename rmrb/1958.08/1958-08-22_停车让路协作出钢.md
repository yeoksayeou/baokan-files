　　Parking and Giving Way for Steel Production Through Cooperation
　　Wu Lü
    All people making steel is not just a mobilizing slogan, but also a guideline for action.

    To turn this mobilizing slogan into a guideline for action, we must promote the spirit of communist cooperation. We have many battlefields. Industry is one battlefield, and agriculture is also a battlefield; steel is one battlefield, and machinery, electricity, coal, etc., are all battlefields in themselves. Every battlefield is tense, everyone is leaping forward, and everyone has their own combat post. Without the spirit of communist cooperation, with everyone only looking after themselves, there would be no all-people steelmaking, and the leading position of the steel industry could not be guaranteed.

    Without the all-people steelmaking situation, the leap forward targets of the steel industry will fall through. If this target falls through, the targets of various departments of the national economy will also fall through.

    It cannot fall through! Promoting the spirit of communist cooperation, all people making steel, it will definitely not fall through!

    The steel industry is speaking: it needs support, it needs cooperation.

    People in the plains should, like the people in Nantong, Hebei, northern Henan and Dingxi Prefecture, organize expeditionary forces to the mountains to engage in "flying mining". With iron ore, there must also be smelting equipment. Machine workers should, like the Harbin machinery factories, prioritize the manufacturing of steel smelting equipment. With iron ore and equipment, there must also be coal. Coal miners must produce more coal for the steel industry. With coal, it must be transported. Transportation workers must be like the "timely rain" in "Water Margin", not delaying the production of the steel industry for a moment…

    In the great battle of all-people steelmaking, everyone can show their skills and contribute their strength. Comrade, what are you prepared to do?

    Cooperation requires a communist style.

    Labor is tight everywhere, and no equipment is idle anywhere. However, for steel, we must not be stingy. We should have such determination: what the steel industry wants, give it; how much it wants, give it; when it wants it, give it.

    The Harbin machinery factories proposed "parking and giving way", temporarily shelving everyday products that can be slowed down, and prioritizing the manufacture of steel smelting equipment, most of which is to support other regions. This is the communist style. With this style, why worry about targets falling through.

    Cooperate to produce steel, with steel it will be easy to handle, everyone come to fight for more steel!
The pace of the pioneers

　　停车让路协作出钢
　　吴滤
    全民办钢铁，不只是一个鼓动的口号，而且是一个行动的方针。
    把这个鼓动的口号变成行动的方针，必须发扬共产主义的协作精神。我们的战场多得很。工业是一个战场，农业也是一个战场；钢铁是一个战场，机械、电力、煤炭等等无不自成战场。各个战场都很紧张，大家都在跃进，人人都有自己的战斗岗位。如果没有共产主义的协作精神，大家各顾各，就没有全民办钢铁的局面，就不能保证钢铁工业的元帅地位。
    没有全民办钢铁的局面，钢铁工业的跃进指标就会落空。这个指标落空，国民经济各个部门的指标也会跟着落空。
    不能落空！发扬共产主义的协作精神，全民办钢铁，也决计不会落空！
    钢铁工业在说话：需要支援，需要协作。
    平原的人们要像南通、河北、豫北地区和定西专区的人们一样，组织远征军到山区搞“飞矿”。有了铁矿，还要有冶炼设备。机械工人们要像哈尔滨的机械工厂一样，优先制造钢铁冶炼设备。有了铁矿，有了设备，还要有煤。煤矿工人要为钢铁工业生产更多的煤炭。有了煤，还要运。运输工人要做“水浒”中的“及时雨”，一时一刻也不耽误钢铁工业的生产……
    在全民办钢铁的大战中，人人都可以大显身手，贡献力量。同志，你准备做些什么？
    协作，需要共产主义风格。
    哪儿的劳动力都是紧张的，哪儿的设备也没有闲着。然而，为了钢铁，决不能吝啬。应该有这样的决心：钢铁工业要什么，给什么；要多少，给多少；什么时候要，什么时候给。
    哈尔滨的机械工厂提出“停车让路”，把可以缓一缓的日常产品暂时搁一下，优先制造钢铁冶炼设备，这些设备大都是支援别的地区的。这就是共产主义风格。有了这种风格，何愁指标落空。
    协作出钢铁，有了钢铁就好办，大家都来为多出钢铁而斗争！先行者的步伐
