Plant More Late Autumn Crops and Strive for Extra Harvests
　　Guizhou Daily Publishes Commentary Criticizing the View of Disregarding Late Autumn Crops
    This newspaper reports Guizhou Daily published a commentary on August 2nd, calling for planting late autumn crops with a revolutionary spirit. The commentary said: Now is the time to sow late autumn crops, we must sow the seeds of late autumn crops as timely as possible and as much as possible, and strive for another harvest after the autumn harvest.
    The commentary pointed out that some people now think that the autumn crops to be harvested are growing better than any previous year, and a bumper harvest is not a problem. Just hold on to this "watermelon," and why bother to spend effort picking up "sesame seeds" (planting late autumn crops)?
    Don't underestimate late autumn crops. The Qianjin Township in Zheng'an County plans to sow late autumn crops on 40% of its cultivated land. If its income is converted into grain, each household in the township can get 3,000 catties. From the perspective of Guizhou Province, if the planting area of late autumn crops can also reach 40% of the cultivated land, that would be at least more than six million mu. If the planting area of grain crops accounts for half of it, that is, three million mu, and the average yield per mu is 500 catties, a total of 1.5 billion catties of grain can be produced. This does not include the income from the other three million mu of non-grain late autumn crops. Just talking about these 1.5 billion catties of grain, can it be said that it is "sesame seeds" that are not worth paying attention to? Obviously not. The political and economic significance of harvesting 1.5 billion catties more grain is self-evident. Moreover, the growing period of late autumn crops (potatoes, autumn buckwheat, vegetables, etc.) is much shorter than that of rice and corn. Taking autumn buckwheat as an example, it only takes one or two months from sowing to harvest. The short growing period is very beneficial for us to save time and save manpower and materials in field management. The income is quite considerable. Therefore, late autumn crops are worth planting on a large scale. Being satisfied with the expected bumper harvest of major crops and not wanting to plant another season of late autumn crops and harvest another season of late autumn crops is incompatible with the revolutionary spirit. As long as there is room for increased production, we must strive for increased production.
    The commentary said that planting late autumn crops will certainly have difficulties. This year, the work of full planting in various places has been done relatively well, and there is very little remaining open space. Moreover, summer production is also relatively heavy, and a lot of labor is required. Increasing the planting of late autumn crops will inevitably increase a lot of work. Some areas will therefore have a labor shortage problem; in addition, the existing fertilizers must be used as top dressing for the autumn crops that are about to mature and as base fertilizer for autumn planting, which is already somewhat tight. Increasing the planting of late autumn crops will make the problem even worse. Difficulties do exist. But the important question is what attitude to take towards difficulties. Some people advocate not planting late autumn crops, and some people advocate planting less late autumn crops. We oppose this attitude. This is an attitude of giving up eating for fear of choking. We advocate facing these difficulties with a revolutionary style. We believe that in order to strive for increased production, these difficulties must be overcome, and at the same time, they can be overcome. Can the problem of less open space be further addressed by intercropping and interplanting? Which crop is suitable for intercropping in which soil? Which crop is suitable for interplanting in which soil? As long as we conduct in-depth interviews with experienced farmers, or patiently discuss with the masses, we will definitely find a solution. The problem of labor shortage can also be solved as long as we are not afraid of trouble and hardship, improve labor organization, reform and promote new tools, and carry out necessary hard struggles. Lack of fertilizer can also be easily solved as long as we make a determined effort. The most fundamental thing is to have a revolutionary style—a style of daring to think and daring to act in the face of difficulties.

　　多种晚秋争取额外丰收
　　贵州日报发表评论批判轻视晚秋作物观点
    本报讯　贵州日报8月2日发表评论，号召用革命的风格种晚秋作物。评论说：现在临到晚秋作物播种的时间了，我们必须及时地、尽可能地多播下晚秋作物的种子，争取在秋熟作物丰收之后再来一个丰收。
    评论指出，现在有些人认为将要收获的秋熟作物长得比以往任何一年都好，大丰收是不成问题的，只要抱住这个“西瓜”就行了，何必去花功夫拣“芝麻”（种晚秋作物）呢？
    不要轻看晚秋作物。正安县前进乡打算播种的晚秋作物面积占耕地面积的40％，其收入价值，如果折成粮食，全乡每户可合三千斤。从贵州全省来看，如果晚秋作物的播种面积也能达到耕地面积的40％，那至少是六百万亩以上。如果其中粮食作物的播种面积占一半，即三百万亩，以每亩平均产粮五百斤计，共可产粮十五亿斤，这还不算其他三百万亩面积的非粮食的晚秋作物收入。单说这十五亿斤粮食，能说是不值得重视的“芝麻”吗？显然不能。多收十五亿斤粮食的政治意义与经济意义是不言而喻的。而且，晚秋作物（洋芋、秋荞、蔬菜等），生长期都要比水稻、包谷等短得多。以秋荞来说，从播种到收获只要个把多月的时间，生长期短，这对于我们节省时间。节省田间管理的人力、物力来说，是很有利的，而收入却又相当可观，因此，晚秋作物是值得大种的。满足于大季作物可望丰收，就不想再种一季晚秋作物，再收一季晚秋作物，这种思想和革命的风格是不相容的。只要有增产的余地，就要争取增产。
    评论说，播种晚秋作物当然会有困难的。今年各地的满播满插工作做得比较好，剩下的空地很少，而且夏季生产也比较繁重，需要的劳力也比较多，增种晚秋作物势必增加很多活路，有些地区会因此而发生劳力不足问题；另外，现有的肥料，又要用作将要成熟的秋熟作物的追肥，又要用作秋种的底肥，本来就有些紧张了，再增种晚秋作物，更成问题。困难确实存在。但是重要的问题是用什么态度去对待困难。有一些人主张不种晚秋作物，有一些人主张少种晚秋作物。我们反对这种态度，这是一种因噎废食的态度。我们提倡用革命的风格去对待这些困难，我们觉得为了争取增产，这些困难是必须克服的，同时也是可以克服的。空地少的问题是否可以进一步从间作套种上想办法呢？哪种作物土里间作哪种作物合适？哪种作物土里套种哪种作物合适？只要深入访问老农，或者耐心地与群众商量，一定会找到解决问题的办法的。劳力不足的问题，只要不嫌麻烦和不畏艰苦，改善劳动组织，改革和推广新工具，进行必要的苦战，也是可以解决的。缺乏肥料，只要下狠心来个突击，也容易解决。最根本的就是要有革命的风格——在困难面前敢想、敢做的风格。
