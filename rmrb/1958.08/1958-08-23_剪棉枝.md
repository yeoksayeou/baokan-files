Pruning Cotton Branches

　　The first time I pruned cotton branches with the farmers, I saw that the branches being cut off were all growing strong and long, and the leaves were also lush green. Moreover, some even had flower buds. I felt very sorry. So I asked a member of the commune why they had to be cut off. He said:

  “Although these branches grow well, they don't bloom or only bloom without producing cotton bolls. They just grow upwards and steal nutrients. If they are not cut off, less cotton will be harvested.”

　　So I thought of us intellectuals. If we think we are so great and do not serve the people, but think all day about climbing upwards, competing for position and fame, wouldn’t we be like those branches that only grow upwards and steal nutrients, and be cut off by the farmers? If we don’t reform, what will be the result?

　　剪棉枝
    第一次，同农民一起剪棉枝，我看见被剪掉的枝枒都是长得粗壮很长，叶子也是碧绿绿的，况且有的还长有花苞呢，心里感到很痛惜。于是问一位社员，为什么要把它们剪掉。他说：
  “这些枝枒虽然长得好，但不开花或者光开花不结桃，只是向上长，抢营养，不剪掉就少收棉花了。”
    于是我想到我们知识分子，如果自以为了不起，并不为人民服务，而整天想的是向上爬，争地位争名利，岂不也就像那些只向上长，抢营养的枝枒一样，被农民剪掉。倘不改造结果该当如何呢？
