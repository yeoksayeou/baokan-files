Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 31st: In sixty-one counties of Guizhou, the number of healthcare facilities run by townships and agricultural cooperatives has grown to over 14,000. In the Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the Tongren and Anshun regions, every township has essentially achieved a publicly run health clinic, and every cooperative has a healthcare room or midwifery station.

These publicly run healthcare facilities were established by farmers in various locations based on urgent production and living needs, utilizing a portion of the township and cooperative's public welfare funds or through fundraising by the masses. The staff consists of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, health personnel from demobilized soldiers, and health personnel trained by local health departments. Publicly run healthcare facilities in mountainous areas have played a significant role in assisting county and district medical and epidemic prevention departments in carrying out prevention and treatment work in rural areas. During the anti-malaria campaign this spring, the 50,000-plus staff of publicly run healthcare facilities in various locations delivered anti-malarial drugs to the homes of people with malaria parasites, guiding them in preventive medication. In forty-nine counties, including Chishui and Qianxi, the number of people undergoing anti-relapse treatment this spring reached over 1.06 million. As a result, the incidence of malaria in the province during the first half of this year decreased by an average of more than 50% compared to the same period last year.

    群众办卫生　医药送上门
    贵州六十一个县民办卫生医疗机构一万四千多个
    据新华社贵阳31日电　贵州六十一个县的乡和农业社办的卫生医疗机构已发展到一万四千多个。在黔南布依族苗族自治州和铜仁、安顺两专区，已基本实现了乡乡有民办卫生所，社社有保健室或接生站。
    这些民办卫生医疗机构是各地农民根据生产和生活上的迫切需要，利用乡、社的部分公益金或由群众集资建成的。工作人员是中医、复员军人中的卫生人员和地方卫生部门训练的卫生人员。山区民办卫生医疗机构在协助县、区医疗防疫部门在农村中开展防治工作起了很大作用。在今年春天抗疟工作中，各地民办卫生医疗机构的五万多工作人员，把抗疟药品送到有疟原虫病人家里，指导他们预服，赤水、黔西等四十九个县今年春季进行抗复发治疗的人数就达一百零六万多人。因而全省今年上半年的疟疾发病率比去年同期平均下降50％强。
