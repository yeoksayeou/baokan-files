　　Writing Factories, Writing Workers, Writing Struggles
　　Tianjin Workers' Amateur Creative Work Flourishes Unprecedentedly
　　Comrade Zhou Yang said that any amateur literary and artistic activity should be conducive to promoting production and to uniting and raising class consciousness

　　(This report) According to a report from this newspaper, the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium on the 5th, attended by nearly 40 amateur writers from 28 units, including the state-owned Tianjin No. 3, 4, and 5 Cotton Textile Factories, Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory, and Tractor Manufacturing Factory. Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and writer Tian Jian also attended the symposium.

　　Since the Great Leap Forward, an unprecedented flourishing situation has emerged in the amateur creative activities of Tianjin's workers. At present, more than 1,000 workers in the city are engaged in literary writing. The Tianjin Shoe Factory, which has more than 1,000 workers, has 150 people writing, accounting for about 10% of the factory's total workers. The Workers' Literary Creation Society, composed of 22 amateur authors, has published more than 150 novels, features, poems, and other works in Tianjin newspapers and periodicals from April to the present. Many of these works have been well received by readers.

　　When the workers started writing, the vast majority of them described the life they were familiar with, writing about factories and themselves. Therefore, the activity of compiling "Factory History" is vigorously developing in many factories in Tianjin. Wang Wenyi, a member of the writing group of the state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory, introduced at the symposium how they mobilized the masses and formed a mass literary creation upsurge in the factory. In the past, there was only one worker in this factory who sometimes wrote articles. In April of this year, the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee convened veteran workers who had participated in previous revolutionary struggles for more than 30 discussions. Based on the clues and materials they provided, they spent a month drawing more than 300 comic strips from the establishment of the factory until the recent announcement of the General Line for decades. They held the first historical exhibition. The workers recalled many past events from the exhibition and further provided many clues and materials. Everyone's creative enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. Yang Zuofu, a cloth field maintenance worker who had never written an article before, worked until 10 o'clock in the evening and continued to write late into the night, regardless of rest.

　　Wang Zijing, a cadre from the No. 3 Cotton Mill with a worker background, introduced the process of clarifying the content of their factory history. Initially, they believed that since it was "factory history," it was the factory's past, and when the past was mentioned, everyone quickly thought of the life of drudgery under the oppression of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and capitalists. Therefore, they drew some comic strips of workers being beaten, scolded, and humiliated in the old society. However, the veteran workers said after reading them: "In the past, we did live under the whip of the exploiting classes; but the tighter their whips were, the more intense our resistance was. If you only see workers being beaten and not workers resisting, then it does not conform to the historical facts of the working class." According to the opinions of the staff and workers, the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee determined that the content of the factory history should focus on politics, and truthfully reflect the historical facts that the working class created social wealth through hard work and achieved liberation under the leadership of the Party, and politically and economically turned themselves over. Do not negatively reflect the lives of workers who were humiliated in the old society.

　　Writing factory history is a powerful tool for the working class to conduct self-education. Zhang Jiquan, a sizing worker from the No. 3 Cotton Mill, used to be picky about his work and argued about wages and benefits. After seeing the factory history exhibition, he cried with emotion. He said that the lives of the older generation were so hard in the past, and they carried out countless heroic and unyielding struggles under the leadership of the Party before they were liberated. My current life is so beautiful, I am really unaware of the blessings. If I continue to argue about wages and benefits, it is simply embarrassing for our working class. So he immediately posted a big-character poster expressing his determination to correct his shortcomings.

　　Tian Xiuzhen, a fine yarn worker from the No. 4 Cotton Mill, reported at the meeting the vigorous development of literary and artistic activities in her workshop.

　　Comrade Zhou Yang gave a speech after listening to everyone's introduction. He said: It is a major event in the cultural revolution that Hebei Province has launched a mass writing movement centered on "praising the Great Leap Forward and recalling revolutionary history." The worker comrades in Tianjin should give full play to their talents and strength in this movement and make even greater achievements. He highly praised the activities of the literary and artistic group of the Fine Yarn Group B of the No. 4 Cotton Mill. He said that this workshop literary and artistic group has always adhered to the principle that literature and art serve politics and production, and has adopted the mass line activity method, and its direction is correct. Worker amateur literary and artistic activities are the weapons for the working masses to conduct self-education in the communist spirit. It must cooperate with the current political tasks, timely reflect the worker life, labor, and struggle of the factory and workshop, encourage the workers' labor enthusiasm, criticize backward phenomena, and enlighten and improve the communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers. Any amateur literary and artistic activity should be conducive to promoting production and to the goal of uniting and raising the consciousness of the working class. It should not be for the sake of art for the sake of art, or for the sake of entertainment for the sake of entertainment. Pure entertainment should also be based on standards that are beneficial to the healthy development of workers' physical and mental health. On the other hand, close cooperation between literature and art and production should not be simply limited to reflecting the production of the factory and workshop. When reflecting on production, in particular, do not "see things but not people," simply describe some production techniques and operating procedures, but focus on expressing the relationship between people in production, and changes in people's character, thoughts, and psychology. Profoundly reflecting a workshop can become an epitome of the entire factory, and even an epitome of the entire working class. After processing, it can become a national work. However, the direct service target of worker amateur literary and artistic activities is the workers of the workshop and factory, so it must first meet the needs of the workers of the workshop and factory, and should not blindly pursue the so-called national level. The close integration of worker amateur literary and artistic activities and production is an unshakable principle. Regarding the question of relying on whom to carry out literary and artistic activities in factories, Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out: We must rely on those workers who are "three good" in politics, labor, and amateur literary and artistic activities to engage in literary and artistic activities. If a worker whose production is not good and whose political consciousness is not high, even if he writes well and sings well, and some people in the literary and artistic circles think he is good, the workers will think he is lagging behind in production and will not approve of him. Moreover, he can never truly express the workers' thoughts and feelings. Such people should not become the object of cultivation in literature and art. Comrade Zhou Yang also particularly emphasized that some worker amateur authors should not be transferred from their production posts. He said that if they leave production too early and enter the literary world as professional writers, it would be equivalent to stifling their talents. We should give more help to worker and peasant authors and less flattery. When Comrade Zhou Yang talked about the relationship between amateur literary and artistic workers and professional literary and artistic workers, he said that the first is that professional authors should learn from amateur authors; secondly, it is about professional authors giving amateur authors some help in writing skills. The professional literary and artistic workers who tutor worker amateur literary and artistic activities must be people with good political qualities. It is better to not have those with poor qualities, and it is absolutely not allowed for those with poor political and ideological qualities to take advantage of the tutoring to arbitrarily spread the poison of bourgeois ideology among the workers. He hoped that the Party committees of various factories would regard worker amateur literary and artistic activities as a powerful tool for conducting communist education and conscientiously grasp it. Regarding the issue of writing factory history, Comrade Zhou Yang believed that this is a good way to conduct class education for the masses of workers, especially young workers. Therefore, writing factory history must follow the mass line, rely on veteran workers and advanced workers, and combine political and ideological education to conduct through recollections and comparisons. Literary and artistic workers, historians, and students from the Chinese and history departments of universities and colleges should actively participate in the writing of factory history. The writing process of factory history is a profound and vivid process of class education. Factory history will provide rich materials for the history of the Chinese workers' movement and literary creation, and those that are well written are complete historical works or vivid literary works. Tianjin's experience in writing factory history is worthy of attention by various regions. (Attached picture)

    写工厂　写工人　写斗争
    天津工人业余创作空前繁荣
　　周扬同志说，任何业余文艺活动，都应有利于推进生产，有利于团结和提高阶级觉悟
    本报讯　中共天津市委宣传部在5日召集了国营天津第三、四、五棉纺织厂、天津市织染厂、拖拉机制造厂等二十八个单位的工人业余作者近四十人举行了座谈会。中共中央宣传部副部长周扬、中共河北省委书记处书记张承先、作家田间等也参加了座谈会。
    自大跃进以来，天津市职工业余创作活动出现了空前的繁荣局面。目前，全市已有一千多名工人从事文艺写作，拥有一千多名工人的天津制鞋厂就有一百五十人动笔写作，约占全厂工人总数的10％。二十二名业余作者组成的工人文艺创作社，从4月份到现在已先后在天津市报刊上发表了一百五十多篇小说、特写、诗歌等作品。其中有不少作品受到读者的欢迎。
    工人们开始从事写作时，绝大多数是描写自己熟悉的生活，写工厂，写自己。因此，编写“工厂史”的活动正在天津市的许多工厂里蓬勃开展。国营天津第五棉纺织厂写作小组的成员王文义在座谈会上介绍了他们如何发动群众，在工厂里形成一个群众性的文艺创作热潮。这个工厂过去只有一个工人有时动笔写写文章，今年4月，党委宣传部曾召集参加历次革命斗争的老工人举行了三十多次座谈，根据他们提供的线索和资料，用了一个月的时间，绘制成从建厂以来直到最近总路线公布，几十年来的三百多幅连环画，举办了第一次历史展览会，工人们从展览会上回忆起很多往事，又进一步提供了许多线索和材料。大家的创作热情空前高涨。从来没有提笔写过文章的布场保全工人杨作福晚上十点钟下班后，不顾休息，一直写到深夜。
    国棉三厂工人出身的干部王子经介绍了他们明确写工厂史内容的过程。最初他们认为既是“厂史”，那就是工厂的过去，而一提起过去，大家很快就想到在帝国主义、国民党反动派和资本家压榨下过的牛马生活。因此，他们就画出一些工人在旧社会挨打骂、受侮辱的连环画，可是老工人们看了以后说：“过去，我们的确是在剥削阶级的皮鞭下过日子；但是，他们的皮鞭子抽得越紧，我们反抗也就越激烈，如果只见工人挨打不见工人反抗，那就不合乎工人阶级的历史事实。”根据职工的意见，党委宣传部门确定工厂史的内容要从政治着眼，把工人阶级从艰苦劳动创造社会财富和在党的领导下经过艰苦斗争得到了解放，在政治上、经济上翻身的史实如实地反映出来，不要消极地反映工人在旧社会受侮辱的生活。
    写工厂史是工人阶级进行自我教育的一个强有力的工具。国棉三厂的浆纱工人张继全，过去干活挑肥拣瘦，争工资、闹待遇，看了工厂史展览以后，他感动地哭了。他说，先辈们过去生活是那么艰苦，他们在党的领导下，进行了无数次的英勇不屈的斗争，才得到解放。我现在的生活是这样美好，真是身在福中不知福，如果再闹工资待遇，简直是给我们工人阶级丢脸，于是他立即贴出大字报，表示改正自己的缺点。
    棉纺四厂细纱工人田秀珍在会上汇报了她所在的车间文艺活动蓬勃开展的情况。
    周扬同志在听完大家的介绍后讲了话。他说：河北全省发起一个群众以“歌颂大跃进，回忆革命史”为中心的工农写作运动，这是文化革命中的一件大事，天津市的工人同志们应当在这个运动中充分发挥自己的才能和力量，做出更大的成绩。他对棉纺四厂细纱乙班文艺组的活动极为称赞。他说，这个车间文艺小组始终坚持了文艺为政治、为生产服务的原则，采取了群众路线的活动方法，方向正确。工人业余文艺活动是工人群众用共产主义精神进行自我教育的武器，它必须配合当前的政治任务，及时地反映本厂、本车间的工人生活、劳动和斗争，鼓舞工人的劳动热情，批评落后现象，启发和提高广大工人群众的共产主义觉悟。任何业余文艺活动，都应有利于推进生产，有利于团结和提高工人阶级觉悟的目的。不应为文艺而文艺，为娱乐而娱乐。纯粹的娱乐也应以有益于工人身心的健康发展为标准。另一方面，文艺密切配合生产，也不能简单地局限于反映本厂、本车间的生产，而在反映生产的时候，尤其不要“见物不见人”，只简单地描写些生产技术和操作过程，而要着重表现生产中的人与人的关系，人的性格、思想和心理的变化。很深刻地反映了一个车间，就可以成为全厂的缩影，以至整个工人阶级的缩影，经过加工，就可以成为具有全国性的作品。但工人业余文艺活动的直接服务对象是本车间、本厂的工人，因此必须首先适合本车间、本厂工人的需要，而不应盲目地追求所谓全国性的水平。工人业余文艺活动必须和生产密切结合，是一个不可动摇的原则。关于依靠哪些人来开展工厂里的文艺活动问题，周扬同志指出：一定要依靠那些政治、劳动和业余文艺活动“三好”的工人来搞文艺活动。如果生产不好、政治觉悟不高的工人，即使写得再好，唱得再好，文艺界某些人认为他好，工人群众却认为他生产落后，还是不会批准他的，而且他也决不可能真实地表现出工人的思想、情感的，这样的人不应成为在文艺上培养的对象。周扬同志还特别强调不要把一些工人业余作者从生产岗位上调出来，他说如果过早的让他脱离生产，登上文坛，作职业作家，就等于把他们的天才扼杀。我们对工农作者应该多帮助，少捧场。周扬同志在谈到业余文艺工作者和专业文艺工作者之间的关系时说，首先是专业作者向业余作者学习；其次，才谈到专业作者给业余作者一些写作技巧上的帮助。辅导工人业余文艺活动的专业文艺工作者一定要政治品质好的人，品质不好的宁可不要，决不允许那些政治思想品质不好的人借辅导为名到工人群众中去任意散布资产阶级思想的毒素。他希望各工厂的党委要把工人业余文艺活动当作进行共产主义教育的一个有力工具，认真地抓起来。关于工厂史的写作问题，周扬同志认为这是对工人群众，特别是青年工人进行阶级教育的良好方式，因此，写工厂史必须走群众路线，依靠老工人和先进工人，结合政治思想教育，通过回忆对比的方式进行。文艺工作者，历史学者，高等学校中文学系、历史系的学生应积极参与工厂史的写作。工厂史的写作过程就是深刻的生动的阶级教育的过程。工厂史将提供中国工人运动史和文艺创作以丰富资料，其中写得好的本身就是完整的历史著作或生动的文艺作品。天津写工厂史的经验值得各地重视。（附图片）
