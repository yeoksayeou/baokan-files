Editorial Note:

    In recent days, this newspaper has continuously reported on the news of people in various regions using indigenous methods to produce ball bearings on a large scale. These facts show that as long as superstitions are eliminated, and the enthusiasm and determination of the masses are brought into play, ball bearing production can be carried out on a large scale in every township and commune without any equipment or technology. Moreover, the product quality is not bad, and the cost is even lower than buying them on the market. Production efficiency can be increased by more than doubled when the operating tools are equipped with these ball bearings. It is for this reason that the masses are very enthusiastic about ball bearing production. They hope to install ball bearings on all operable tools within a few months, so as to better solve the difficulty of labor shortage.

    However, how can we accelerate the production of ball bearings? In addition to continuing to mobilize the masses, we should also strengthen the collaboration and support between industrial and agricultural departments. The Xihua County Machinery Factory in Xuchang Prefecture has already distributed fifteen wooden lathes to support the townships and communes in making their own ball bearings. Changge County has adopted the method of old factories leading new factories, sending technicians to provide specific assistance.

    This approach is worth greatly promoting. It is hoped that factories in various regions can take the initiative to care about the situation of local farmers manufacturing ball bearings, actively distribute surplus machines to townships and communes, and enthusiastically send workers to provide technical guidance, so that the agricultural tool reform movement can develop faster, and that 500 million farmers can be freed from heavy manual labor as soon as possible.

    工业部门应该多支援
    这几天，本报连续报道了各地群众用土法大造滚珠轴承的消息。这些事实说明，只要破除了迷信，发扬了群众的干劲和钻劲，在没有任何设备和技术的条件下，乡乡社社都可以大搞滚珠轴承生产，而且产品质量并不差，成本比市上买的还低；运转工具安上了这些滚珠轴承，生产效率就可以提高一倍以上。正是这个原因，群众搞滚珠轴承生产的劲头非常大，他们希望在几个月内，把一切能运转的工具都安装上滚珠轴承，以便更好地解决劳力不足的困难。
    但是，怎样才能加速滚珠轴承的生产呢？这除了继续发动群众之外，还应该加强工农业部门之间的协作和支援。许昌专区西华县机械厂为了支援乡社自制滚珠轴承，已经下放木制车床十五部；长葛县用老厂带新厂的办法，下放技术员去具体帮助。
    这种做法值得大大提倡。希望各地工厂都能主动地关心当地农民制造滚珠轴承的情况，积极地把多余的机器下放到乡、社，热情地派工人去进行技术指导，好使农具改革运动更快地发展，好使五亿农民早日摆脱繁重的手工操作。
