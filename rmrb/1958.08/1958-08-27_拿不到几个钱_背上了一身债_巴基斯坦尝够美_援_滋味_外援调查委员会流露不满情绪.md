Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 24th - According to the "Pakistan Times," the Pakistani Foreign Aid Investigation Committee, in its report discussing the economic "assistance" given to Pakistan by the United States, stated that as of July 1957, the total amount of U.S. "aid" allocations to Pakistan in terms of technology, capital, commodities, and relief was 564,340,000 U.S. dollars, but the actual amount received by Pakistan is estimated to be only 35,930,000 U.S. dollars.

The Foreign Aid Investigation Committee was established in July 1956, and it took more than two years to submit this report to the government, which reflects Pakistan's dissatisfaction with U.S. "aid." Some parts of the report have already been published in the "Dawn" newspaper.

The report said that among all the "aid" provided by the United States to Pakistan, capital "assistance" as an economic development fund accounted for only 17% of the total "aid," and the amount actually received by Pakistan was even lower than the figure stipulated.

The report said that before 1954, all U.S. "aid" to Pakistan was provided on a grant basis, but since 1955, the loan component has gradually increased. Now the loan component accounts for nearly 16% of the total "aid." In Pakistan, the gross national product is still very low, while expenditures in areas such as national defense are very large, so the ability to repay loans is very limited.

The report said that Pakistan will soon begin repaying U.S. loans, which will bring a serious strain to the already overburdened Pakistani economy.

The report said, "Special foreign aid should not continue beyond the necessary minimum period. Pakistan should strive to reach a situation as soon as possible where its own production can reach a level that can sustain its current consumption needs and the needs of further economic development." However, the report also worried that "the cancellation or reduction of U.S. aid would have a serious impact on Pakistan's economic situation."

### 拿不到几个钱　背上了一身债  巴基斯坦尝够美“援”滋味  外援调查委员会流露不满情绪

　　拿不到几个钱　背上了一身债
    巴基斯坦尝够美“援”滋味
    外援调查委员会流露不满情绪
    新华社卡拉奇24日电　据“巴基斯坦时报”报道，巴基斯坦的外援调查委员会在它的论述美国给予巴基斯坦的经济“援助”的报告中说，截至1957年7月为止，美国在技术、资金、商品和救济等方面给予巴基斯坦的“援助”拨款总数为五亿六千四百三十四万美元，但是巴基斯坦实际收到的款项估计只有三千五百九十三万美元。
    外援调查委员会是在1956年7月设立的，它花了大约两年以上的时间才向政府提出了这个报告，在这个报告中反映了巴基斯坦对美“援”的不满情绪。报告的有些部分已经在“黎明报”发表。
    报告说，美国向巴基斯坦提供的全部“援助”中，作为经济发展基金的资金“援助”只占全部“援助”的17％，而巴基斯坦实际上收到的这类款项还比规定给予的数字低。
    报告说，在1954年以前，所有给予巴基斯坦的美“援”是在赠款的基础上提供的，但是从1955年以来，贷款的成分已经逐渐增加。现在贷款的成分占“援助”总数的近16％。在巴基斯坦，全国生产总值仍然很低，而国防等方面的支出又很大，因此偿还贷款的能力是十分有限的。
    报告说，巴基斯坦不久将开始偿还美国的贷款，这将对已经负担过重的巴基斯坦经济带来一种严重的紧张。
    报告说，“特别的外援过了必要的最短时期以后不应该再继续。巴基斯坦应该争取尽快达到这样一种情况：它自己的生产能够达到可以维持它自己目前的消费需要和进一步经济发展的需要的水平。”但是，报告又担心，“取消或减少美援，就会对巴基斯坦的经济情况造成严重的影响。”
