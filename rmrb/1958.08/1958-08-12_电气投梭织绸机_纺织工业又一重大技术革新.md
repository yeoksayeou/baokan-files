　　Electrical Shuttle Weaving Silk Loom
　　Another Major Technological Innovation in the Textile Industry
    On August 4th, an electrically controlled "Electrical Shuttle Weaving Silk Loom" was successfully created in Hangzhou Yongchun Silk Weaving Factory, which is a major innovation in the textile industry.
    This "Electrical Shuttle Weaving Silk Loom" eliminates the shuttle driving device, which accounts for 70% of the parts of the silk weaving machine. Using it for production can eliminate the shuttle-jamming accidents that have always existed in the textile industry, greatly improve product quality, increase the speed by 56%, eliminate the deafening noise in the workshop, and prevent frequent production shutdowns caused by the damage of parts in the shuttle driving device, as in the past. Manufacturing this silk weaving machine can save a large amount of steel raw materials, and the manufacturing time can also be shortened from the original eight days to three and a half days, thus greatly reducing the cost.
    This silk weaving machine was successfully created through hard study and bold experimentation by Chen Jinyuan and Han Zhongfu, young workers from Hangzhou Chunguang Silk Weaving Production Cooperative, and nine workers from factories such as Yongchun Silk Weaving Factory and Dujinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, who went to many units in Hangzhou to learn some electrical knowledge from engineers and technicians.
    Now, relevant electrical technicians have visited this machine at Yongchun Silk Weaving Factory and are further studying how to increase the speed and prepare to promote it in the textile system. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

### 电气投梭织绸机　纺织工业又一重大技术革新

　　电气投梭织绸机
　　纺织工业又一重大技术革新
    一种以电力控制的“电气投梭织绸机”8月4日在杭州市永春丝织厂创制成功，这是纺织工业中的一项重大创举。
    这种“电气投梭织绸机”，省去了织绸机上占整部机子70％的零件的打梭装置部分。用它生产，可以消灭纺织工业中一直存在的轧梭事故，大大提高产品质量，车速可以提高56％，车间里再也听不到震耳的响声，而且不像过去那样由于打梭装置部分机件损坏而常常停止生产了。制造这种织绸机，可节约大量的钢铁原料，制造时间也可以从原来的八天缩短到三天半，因此大大降低了造价。
    这种织绸机是杭州春光丝织生产合作社青年工人陈锦源、韩中府，和永春丝织厂、都锦生丝织厂等工厂的九个工人，跑到杭州市很多单位向工程师和技术人员学习了一些电气知识，经过苦学苦钻，大胆创造试验成功的。
    现在有关电工技术人员都到永春丝织厂参观了这台机器，正在进一步研究加快车速，准备在纺织系统推广。　（新华社）（附图片）
