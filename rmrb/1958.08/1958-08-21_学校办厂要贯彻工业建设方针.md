　　Schools Running Factories Must Implement the Guiding Principles of Industrial Construction
　　Commentator of this newspaper
    Recently, colleges and universities across the country have been running factories on a large scale, with chimneys standing tall and new products being launched every day. College students are also acting as workers. Although it has not been long, we can already see many benefits of schools running factories. Schools running factories can combine productive labor with professional education in the long term, according to their own professional characteristics and needs; they can actively arrange teaching time and labor time, creating more convenient and favorable conditions for teaching and scientific research; they can increase some wealth for the country and also provide some income for students. Schools running factories on a large scale, combining education and labor, and combining mental and physical labor, can quickly cultivate a large number of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture for the country.
    How should schools run factories? School factories are a part of the national industry, so schools must implement the unified national industrial policy in running factories. Schools must implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small-sized enterprises, and combining indigenous and foreign methods; they must implement the policy of self-reliance, starting from scratch, making do with whatever is available, and running factories diligently and thriftily. Since schools across the country started running factories on a large scale, schools in various places have adopted many methods. Some have expanded on the basis of laboratories or practice factories, with relatively complete equipment; others are completely manual factories; some have established small blast furnaces, and some have established iron and steel joint enterprises that smelt various alloy steels. Schools running factories can be both popular and advanced. There are factories suitable for students to popularize technology, and there are also new types of factories with higher technical levels or combined with research on cutting-edge science and technology. Some school-run factories are run by various departments and teaching and research groups in combination with their own majors, while others are comprehensive factories for the whole school. The idea of only wanting to run large factories and not small ones; only wanting new ones and not old ones; only wanting to improve and not popularize; only wanting to engage in comprehensive projects and not professional ones is wrong. If we do it that way, we cannot achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, and we can only be desolate and unsuccessful. Only by starting from reality and adopting various methods can we run factories more, faster, better, and more economically, and vigorously.
    Some people believe that in order to have good products, we must have good equipment, so they pursue new equipment and talk about extravagance. Some schools ask for materials with their hands outstretched and lack enthusiasm. In fact, the quality of products is not determined by the quality of equipment. Many schools minimize or do not buy new materials, and make full use of the school's original old materials or substitutes. They use old materials whenever possible and borrow whenever possible instead of buying. Students at Chengdu Institute of Technology overcame difficulties and used scrap iron filings and iron sheets to refine oil-containing bearings needed for building factories. Xi'an Jiaotong University opened a drawing instrument manufacturing factory without spending a penny, repairing old drilling machines and machine tools. Students of the Civil Engineering Department of Tianjin University established a factory. All materials and equipment were solved by themselves without spending a penny from the state. They used discarded gears and steel rods to assemble a rotating shaft, and used broken washbasins as machine housings, and finally made a blower. Beijing Railway Institute made full use of original old materials and substitutes in establishing a sleeper factory. This spirit of starting from scratch and running factories on a large scale is a revolutionary spirit. Under the education of this kind of production practice, young students can be trained into builders of the new era who use their own hands to turn waste into gold and let old machines create miracles.
    "Everyone competes with Luban, enthusiasm breaks through the sky, in less than half a day, the factory building stands before our eyes!" This is a student from Changchun Geological Exploration Institute praising their enthusiasm for running factories. Let the vast number of young students advance along the direction guided by the Party, break superstitions, emancipate their minds, dare to think and act, work hard and practically, and, under the guidance of teachers, with the support of staff and workers, and with the cooperation of inside and outside the school, run factories more, faster, better, and more economically, produce more products, and consolidate and develop factories. Experience has proved that schools can not only run factories, but also run factories more, faster, better, and more economically. On the basis of combining education and labor, schools can also be run into real socialist schools. Now, some bystanders and opponents have to admit defeat. Students of the Renmin University of China used an analogy, "It's like a sunken ship, with black masts, about to be submerged by the red wave of factories." We must also set off a larger red wave of factory-running to train ourselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

　　学校办厂要贯彻工业建设方针
　　本报评论员
    最近以来，全国高等学校大办工厂，烟囱林立，天天有新产品问世，大学生兼做了工人。虽然时间不长，已经可以看到学校办工厂的好处很多。学校办工厂，可以根据自己的专业特点和需要，使生产劳动和专业教育长期地结合起来；可以主动地安排教学时间和劳动时间，给教学和科学研究造成更方便更有利的条件；可以为国家增加一些财富，也为学生提供了一部分收入。学校大办工厂，使教育和劳动相结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，就可以迅速地为国家培养出大批的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    学校怎样办工厂呢？学校的工厂是国家工业的一个部分，所以学校办工厂必须贯彻国家办工业的统一方针。学校办工厂要贯彻大中小并举，土洋并举；要贯彻自力更生，白手起家，因陋就简，勤俭办工厂的方针。全国学校大办工厂以来，各地学校采取了许多办法，有在实验室或实习工厂的基础上扩充起来的、设备比较齐全的工厂；也有完全手工操作的工厂，有建立小高炉的，也有建立冶炼各种合金钢的钢铁联合企业的。学校办工厂，可以又普及又提高，有适合学生用来普及技术而办的工厂，也有技术水平较高，或者结合研究尖端科学技术而办的新型工厂。学校办工厂，有由各系和教研组举办的同自己专业结合的工厂，也有全校性的综合工厂。那种只想办大的，不想办小的；只想办新的，不想要旧的；只想提高，不想普及；只想搞综合的，不想搞专业的思想是不对头的。要照那样办，就不能多快好省，就只能冷冷清清，而且办得不好。只有从实际出发，采取多种办法，才能把工厂办得多快好省，轰轰烈烈。
    有人认为，要得产品好，就要设备好，因而追求新设备，讲阔气。有的学校伸着手要材料，干劲不足。事实上，产品质量的高低，设备好坏并不是决定因素。许多学校都是尽量少买或不买新材料，充分利用学校原有旧料或代用料，能使用旧料就不用新料，能借用就不购买。成都工学院学生克服困难，用废铁屑、铁皮炼制成建厂需要的含油轴承。西安交通大学开办绘图仪器制造厂，不花一个钱，修理破旧的钻床和机床。天津大学土木系学生建立工厂，全部材料、设备都是自己解决，不花国家一文钱，用废弃的齿轮、钢杆拼成转动轴，用破脸盆当作机壳，终于制成一台鼓风机。北京铁道学院建立轨枕厂中，充分利用原有旧料和代用料。这种白手起家，大办工厂的精神，就是革命的精神。在这种生产实践的教育下，才能把青年学生培养成用自己的双手，使废物变成黄金，让旧机器创造奇迹的新时代的建设者。
    “个个赛鲁班，干劲冲破天，不上小半天，厂房立眼前！”这是长春地质勘探学院一个学生歌颂他们办工厂的热情的诗句。让广大青年学生沿着党所指导的方向前进，破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢做，苦干实干，在教师指导，职工支持和校内外协作下，把工厂办得多快好省，生产出更多的产品，使工厂得到巩固和发展。经验证明，学校不但能办工厂，而且能多快好省地办工厂。在教育和劳动结合的基础上，也就能把学校办成真正的社会主义学校。现在，有些观潮派和反对派不得不服输了。中国人民大学的学生打个比喻，“它像一只沉船，黑色的桅顶，眼看就要被工厂的红色巨浪淹没了。”我们还必须掀起更大的办工厂的红色巨浪，把自己培养成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者。
