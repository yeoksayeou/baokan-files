Shaanxi Prefectural and County Party Committee Secretaries' Meeting Criticizes Conservative Thinking

(Our reporter Yi Xiao reports from Xi'an) The CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee held a meeting of prefectural, municipal, and county party committee secretaries from July 19th to 26th, adding further impetus to the second wave of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, to guarantee a bumper harvest this autumn.

The meeting held that the current situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production is very good, and the leaping upsurge to strive for a bumper autumn harvest is continuing to rise, with autumn seedlings growing generally well. Thanks to the victory of the rectification movement, the deep understanding of the general line for building socialism, and the encouragement of the bumper summer harvest, the masses are very enthusiastic, and counties, townships, and communes are cultivating high-yield "satellite" fields and large-area high-yield fields.

However, the ideological understanding of some cadres lags behind reality and behind the masses. In the new situation of the great leap forward, some new right-leaning conservative ideas have emerged. One is the theory of regional conditions, which holds that areas with good conditions can strive to be advanced and strive for first place, while areas with difficult conditions cannot strive to be advanced. Another is the "good enough" theory, which is satisfied with an increase of only a dozen or several tens of percent in the yield of several crops, and does not dare to make an all-round leap forward or a great leap forward. There is also the idea that a great leap forward can only be made next year, and only a small leap forward can be made this year, only shouting about next year, and lacking confidence in a bumper harvest this autumn. The meeting criticized these right-leaning ideas, pointing out that wherever there are masses in the province, there are conditions for a leap forward; as long as they dare to leap forward, they can leap forward; dare to leap forward in an all-round way, they can leap forward in an all-round way; dare to make a great leap forward, they can make a great leap forward; and how much effort they put in, how much of a leap forward they will achieve. To leap forward requires seeing results in the current year. If we don't jump far this year, it will be even more difficult to jump far next year. The meeting held that right-leaning conservative thinking is a serious obstacle to the current great leap forward. It called on Party committees at all levels and in all localities to immediately launch a mass struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking, to uproot white flags and plant red flags, to thoroughly destroy and establish, to break with the right-leaning conservative thinking of being content with being in the middle and willingly submitting to inferiority, and to establish the leaping thinking of striving for advancement and striving for first place.

The meeting believed that as long as we seize this crucial time from now until the end of September, exert ourselves fully, and work hard, the plan for a bumper harvest this year can be fully realized. We must firmly grasp the four measures of fertilizer, field management, irrigation, and deep plowing, and persevere to the end.

The meeting held that the fundamental way to solve the shortage of labor is to reform tools, so it called for a comprehensive movement to improve old tools and promote new agricultural implements.

The meeting decided: In order to realize the above measures, we must carry out a mass inspection and comparison movement, requiring cadres at all levels to go deep into the fields and produce together with the masses, inspect and classify autumn fields plot by plot, plant red flags on first-class fields, improve second- and third-class fields, and strive to make everything red. At the same time, the inspection and comparison should be combined with the promotion of advanced experiences and the establishment of advanced banners, and once advanced models are discovered, on-site meetings should be held for widespread promotion.

### 把秋季生产推向更高潮  陕西地市县委书记会议批判保守思想

    把秋季生产推向更高潮
    陕西地市县委书记会议批判保守思想
    本报西安电  记者伊晓报道：中共陕西省委于7月19日到26日间召开地、市、县委书记会议，为已经掀起来的今年农业生产大跃进的第二个浪潮再加一把劲，保证今秋大丰收。
    会议认为，当前农业生产大跃进形势很好，争取秋田大丰收的跃进浪潮，正在继续高涨，秋苗生长普遍良好。由于整风运动的胜利，建设社会主义总路线的深入人心以及夏季作物大丰收的鼓舞，群众干劲很足，县县、乡乡、社社培育高额丰产“卫星”田和大面积丰产田。
    但是有些干部的思想认识落后于实际，落后于群众，在新的大跃进形势下出现了若干新的右倾保守思想。一种是地区条件论，认为条件好的地区能够争上游，争第一，条件困难的地方就不能争上游。再则是“差不多论”，满足于几种农作物增产百分之十几和几十，不敢全面跃进和大跃进。还有一种是认为明年才能大跃进，今年只能小跃进，空喊来年，对今秋丰产信心不足。会议批判了这些右倾思想，指出全省凡是有群众的地方，就有条件跃进；只要敢于跃进，就能够跃进；敢于全面跃进，就能全面跃进；敢于大跃进，就能大跃进；付出多大的干劲，就会有多大的跃进。要跃进，就要求当年见高低，今年跳的不远，明年要想跳的远就会更困难。会议认为，右倾保守思想是当前大跃进的严重障碍。要求各级各地党委立即展开一个群众性的反对右倾保守思想的斗争，拔白旗插红旗，大破大立，破甘居中游、甘拜下风的右倾保守思想，立力争上游、力争第一的跃进思想。
    会议认为只要从现在起到9月底止，抓住这个关键时间，鼓足干劲，大干一场，今年大丰收的计划完全可以实现。要狠狠地抓肥料、田间管理、灌溉和深翻地四项措施，坚持抓到底。
    会议认为，解决劳力不足的根本办法是改革工具，因此要求全面开展一个改良旧工具、推广新农具运动。
    会议决定：为实现以上措施，要开展群众性的检查评比运动，要求各级干部深入田间，和群众一道生产，对秋田逐块检查分类，一类田插红旗，提高二三类田，力争处处红。同时把检查评比和推广先进经验、树立先进旗帜结合起来，发现先进典型就召开现场会议普遍推广。
    斟察队员：这是金山吗？
    牧童：不，这是粮山。
