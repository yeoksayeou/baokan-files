    Superphosphate of Lime
    Superphosphate of lime is a chemical phosphate fertilizer that can be used as topdressing or as a base fertilizer. Superphosphate of lime generally contains about 18% water-soluble phosphorus. When used as a base fertilizer, superphosphate of lime can be mixed with organic fertilizers such as peat and compost.
    Peat
    Peat is also called sod peat, and sometimes grass coal, mud coal, or grass rafts. Peat is the plant remains of ancient lake and swamp areas buried underground, which cannot be fully decomposed under humid conditions and poor ventilation. Peat is divided into high-level peat, low-level peat, and transitional peat. Most of the peat found in China is low-level peat.
    Low-level peat (dry matter) generally contains about 1.81% nitrogen, 0.30% phosphoric acid, and 0.27% potassium oxide. Peat is a raw material for manufacturing granular fertilizers.
