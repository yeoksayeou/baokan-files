Xinhua News Agency, London, August 28th: The British monthly magazine "Eastern World" has criticized US policy in Asia, particularly its policy towards China.

The September issue of "Eastern World" states in its editorial that the recently published US memorandum regarding its policy of hostility towards China "may prove to be the most historically significant error taken by the State Department." The magazine writes: "This document reaffirms the US attitude, which recent developments have clearly demonstrated is not only outdated but also dangerously challenging."

The magazine then discusses China's economic development. It says: "Today's China is far from the China that the world understood during the Korean War. Its domestic development in the last year or two has been completely astounding. In recent weeks, serious observers who have revisited China after several years have stated without hesitation that in twenty years, this country will be among the most economically and industrially powerful countries in the world. This should prove the falsity of Dulles's claim that the current regime is likely to collapse if it is ignored and excluded."

The magazine calls for the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations for the sake of future peace.

Referring to the recent statement by the US State Department regarding Cambodia's establishment of diplomatic relations with China, "Eastern World" magazine points out that this US policy is rude. The magazine says: "If the United States does not consider it inappropriate for this neutral country to establish diplomatic relations with Washington and Saigon, then why should normal exchanges with China be 'regrettable'?" The magazine says: "In Washington's view, a country is only 'free' when it complies with America's outdated and, in the long run, ineffective activities of arming Asians to fight Asians."

　　态度过时　举动危险
    英国杂志抨击美国敌视中国的政策
    据新华社伦敦28日电这里的“东方世界”月刊抨击美国在亚洲的政策，特别是对待中国的政策。
    9月份的“东方世界”的社论说，美国最近发表的关于它敌视中国的政策的备忘录“可能证明是国务院所采取的最具有历史意义的错误的步骤。”这家月刊写道：“这个文件重申了美国的态度，而最近的事态发展已经明显地证明这种态度不仅过时了，而且具有危险的挑战性。”
    这家月刊接着谈到中国的经济发展。它说：“今天的中国远不是世界在朝鲜战争期间所了解的那个中国了。最近一两年它的国内发展完全是惊人的。在最近几个星期中，几年来再度访问中国的认真的观察家们毫不犹豫地说，在二十年后，这个国家将处于世界上经济和工业方面最强大的国家之列。这一点应该可以证明杜勒斯的说法的虚伪性，杜勒斯说，目前的政权如果被无视和排斥的话，就很可能垮台。”
    这家月刊要求为了未来和平的利益，恢复中国在联合国中的席位。
    “东方世界”月刊在谈到美国国务院最近就柬埔寨同中国建立外交关系一事发表的声明时指出，美国这种政策是无礼的。这家月刊说：“如果美国不认为这个中立国家同华盛顿和西贡建立外交关系是不适宜的，那么为什么同中国建立正常交往应该是‘令人遗憾的’呢？”这家月刊说：“在华盛顿看来，只有在一个国家顺应美国的过时的、长远说来也是无效的把亚洲人武装起来打亚洲人的活动的时候，它才是‘自由’的。”
