Warning to the Aggressors (Shandong Kuaishu)
    Shandong Delegation to the National Quyi Performance, Zhang Jun
How ridiculous are America and Britain, one blind and the other lame. One had its eyes blinded on the Korean battlefield; the other was beaten by the Egyptian people, losing legs and arms. They don't remember the lessons of history, and they are struggling desperately to do evil again, extending their claws to the Mediterranean, igniting the flames of war in the Middle East. They dream of first occupying Jordan and Lebanon, and then subverting the United Arab Republic and Iraq. With our American and British troops providing "protection," that's what "freedom" means for the Arabs. The mad dog is having a good dream when suddenly a thunderclap shakes the mountains and rivers, scaring the warmongers into a shiver. It turns out that the Sino-Soviet talks are being held in Beijing, with the aim of defending peace and opposing aggression! Sino-Soviet unity is powerful, and there is confidence in stopping war. People all over the world are responding, and the people of the Middle East have many friends. A stern warning to the aggressors: quickly withdraw your blood-soaked claws. American devils, get out of Lebanon immediately! British devils, get out of Jordan and go back to Britain! If you are stubborn and refuse to come to your senses, you will inevitably end up like a clay idol trying to cross the great river with a paper man in its arms. The East Wind will always prevail over the West Wind. Failing to face reality accurately guarantees failure!

    警告侵略者（山东快书）
    全国曲艺会演山东代表团　张军可笑美国和英国，一个瞎来一个瘸，这一个朝鲜战场碰瞎了眼；那一个被埃及人民打的缺腿少胳膊。历史教训全不记，垂死挣扎又作恶，魔爪伸向地中海，侵略中东点战火。梦想着先占约旦、黎巴嫩，然后再颠复阿联、伊拉克。有我们美军英军来“保护”，那才是“自由”的阿拉伯。疯狗正在作好梦，猛然间霹雳一声震山河，吓得那战争贩子打哆嗦。却原是中苏会谈在北京，目的是保卫和平反侵略！中苏团结力量大，制止战争有把握，全世界人民都响应，中东人民的朋友多，严厉警告侵略者，快把你血淋淋的爪子往回缩。美国鬼赶快滚出黎巴嫩！英国鬼滚出约旦回英国！倘若是执迷不省悟，免不了落一个泥菩萨抱着纸人过大河。东风永远压倒西风，不正视现实准砸锅！
