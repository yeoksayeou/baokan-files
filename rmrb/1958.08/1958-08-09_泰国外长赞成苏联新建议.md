Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 8th: Thai Foreign Minister Narathip stated to the press on the 6th that the Thai government fully agrees with the Soviet proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss and resolve the Middle East issue. He said that the Thai cabinet had already decided to support the convening of this meeting. Narathip said that resolving the Middle East issue through an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly is better than resolving it through the Security Council, because in the UN General Assembly, all countries, large and small, have the right to speak. He also expressed his belief that the majority of countries in the United Nations hope for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East issue as soon as possible.

The "Eternal Daily" also published an editorial on the 7th, agreeing with the Soviet proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, and believed that this meeting should urge the United States and Britain to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

    泰国外长赞成苏联新建议
    据新华社8日讯  曼谷消息：泰国外交部长那拉底6日向报界发表谈话说，泰国政府完全赞成苏联提出的召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论解决中东问题的建议。他说，泰国内阁早就已经决定赞成召开这个会议。那拉底说，由联合国大会紧急会议来解决中东问题比由安全理事会解决好，因为在联合国大会的会议上，不论大小国家都有发言权。他还表示相信联合国大多数国家都希望早日和平解决中东问题。
    “永恒报”7日也发表社论赞同苏联提出的召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议，并且认为这个会议应当促使美英两国撤退它们在黎巴嫩和约旦的军队。
