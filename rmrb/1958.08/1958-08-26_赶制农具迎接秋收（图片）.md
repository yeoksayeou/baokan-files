Rushing to Produce Farm Tools to Welcome the Autumn Harvest

　　The Tianchi Township in Yibin County, Sichuan, has opened more than ten farm tool processing factories in a short period of time, working day and night to rush production of farm tools urgently needed for the autumn harvest and autumn planting. This is the Zhengping United Cooperative's farm tool processing factory rushing to produce continuous operation harrows to support the rush transplanting of late rice. This type of continuous operation harrow has blades, rolling teeth, and harrow teeth. Just one continuous operation can complete the transplanting, increasing work efficiency by about 30% compared to ordinary plows and harrows. Xinhua News Agency reporter You Yungu photographed.

　　赶制农具迎接秋收
    四川宜宾县天池乡在短期内就开办了十多个农具加工厂，日夜赶制秋收、秋种所急需的农具。这是正平联社的农具加工厂在赶制连作耙支援抢裁晚稻。这种连作耙有刀、滚齿和耙齿，只要一道连作，就能插殃，比一般犁耙提高工效30％左右。　新华社记者　游云谷摄
