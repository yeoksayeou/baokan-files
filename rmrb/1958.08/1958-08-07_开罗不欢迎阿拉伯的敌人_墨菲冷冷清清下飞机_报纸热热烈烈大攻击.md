Cairo Does Not Welcome the Enemies of the Arabs
Murphy Arrives Coldly and Quietly; Newspapers Launch Fiery Attacks
(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reports: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Murphy arrived in Cairo from Beirut on the evening of the 5th, and was met with a cold reception.

At the airport, no officials from the United Arab Republic welcomed him. Only the U.S. Ambassador to the UAR, Raymond Hare, and embassy staff were present to greet him.

At the airport, Murphy told reporters that he hoped to meet with President Nasser tomorrow to discuss “general problems in the Middle East.”

When asked about when the American aggressor troops would withdraw from Lebanon, Murphy still indicated that the American aggressor troops would occupy Lebanon for a long time. He said that it was "impossible to determine a specific date" for the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon.

Another reporter asked him whether General Chehab was "happy" about the presence of the American occupation forces in Lebanon, to which the American envoy replied, "I cannot say he is happy, because he faces a difficult situation. We have the closest and most friendly relations with him."

For the past two days, Murphy has been the target of attacks in Cairo newspapers. The newspapers drew readers' attention to the fact that while Murphy was visiting Middle Eastern countries, attempting to whitewash America's aggressive intentions, American reinforcements were pouring into Lebanon.

"The Republic" said: "If his country continues to adopt an attitude based on illegal interference and traitorous agents as the basis of its policy, then his visits and talks are useless."

"Al Ahram" said that Murphy's trip has the same purpose as the American troop landings in Lebanon, which is to maintain the imperialist position in the Arab East and strangle the Arab people's national liberation movement.

### 开罗不欢迎阿拉伯的敌人  墨菲冷冷清清下飞机　报纸热热烈烈大攻击

    开罗不欢迎阿拉伯的敌人
    墨菲冷冷清清下飞机　报纸热热烈烈大攻击
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国副国务卿帮办墨菲5日晚上从贝鲁特到达开罗，受到冷淡待遇。
    在机场上，没有一个阿拉伯联合共和国的官员欢迎他，只有美国驻阿联大使雷蒙德·黑尔和大使馆人员在机场上迎接。
    墨菲在机场对记者们说，他希望明天会见纳赛尔总统，会谈有关“中东的一般问题”。
    墨菲在回答关于美国侵略军在什么时候撤出黎巴嫩的问题时，仍然表示美国侵略军要长期侵占黎巴嫩。他说，要确定美军撤离黎巴嫩的“一个具体日期是不可能的”。
    另一个记者问他，谢哈布将军对于美国占领军驻在黎巴嫩是否“高兴”，这位美国使节答道，“我不能说是高兴的，因为他面对着困难的局面。我们同他有最密切和最友好的关系。”
    墨菲两天来成了开罗报纸攻击的目标。报纸让读者注意这个事实：正当墨菲在中东国家进行访问，企图粉饰美国的侵略意图时，美国增援部队正源源开入黎巴嫩。
    “共和国报”说：“如果他的国家要继续采取以非法干涉和卖国代理人为政策基础的态度，那么他的访问和会谈都是没有用的。”
    “晚报”说，墨菲此行同美军在黎巴嫩登陆的目的相同，就是要保持帝国主义在阿拉伯东方的阵地，扼杀阿拉伯人民的民族解放运动。
