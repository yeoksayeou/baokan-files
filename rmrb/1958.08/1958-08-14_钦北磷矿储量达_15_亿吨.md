　　Qinzhou North Phosphate Mine Reserves Reach 1.5 Billion Tons
    The Qinzhou North Zhuang Autonomous County in Guangdong has recently discovered a large-scale phosphorus-bearing stratum: more than ten kilometers long and one kilometer wide, with a phosphorus-bearing layer thickness of about 500 meters. The ore layer thickness still needs to be proven by work, but surface sampling and testing results show that it contains 7% to 12% phosphorus pentoxide, which is of a lower grade. It is estimated that there will be enriched sections within the extensive mining area, and preliminary estimates suggest potential reserves of more than 1.5 billion tons.
    This large phosphate mine was discovered by the Guangzhou Geological School's work-study geology team after conducting a general survey based on ore deposit leads provided by the masses.

　　钦北磷矿储量达15亿吨
    广东钦北僮族自治县最近发现规模很大的含磷地层：长十余公里，宽一公里，含磷层厚度约有五百公尺，矿层厚度还待工作证明，但地表采样化验结果，含五氧化二磷7％到12％，品位较低，估计在广泛的矿区内，会有富集块段，初步估计可能有远景储量在十五亿吨以上。
    这个大磷矿，是广州地质学校学生勤工俭学地质队，根据群众提供的报矿线索进行普查以后发现的。
