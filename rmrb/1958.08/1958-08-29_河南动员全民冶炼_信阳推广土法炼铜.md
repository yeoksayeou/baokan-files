According to the Henan Daily: Under the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the demand for mechanical and electrical equipment has increased sharply, and the required copper and aluminum have also increased significantly. In order to quickly solve the current shortage of copper and aluminum production, on August 25, the Henan Provincial People's Committee instructed all regions to vigorously organize the increase in copper and aluminum production. Currently, a mass production campaign using indigenous methods for smelting copper and aluminum is taking shape across various regions.

Henan Province is rich in mineral resources. There are copper ore veins in 157 locations in 36 counties, and bauxite that can be mined in more than 20 counties. At the same time, many regions have experience in indigenous copper and aluminum smelting methods. Based on the experience of the whole Party and all the people running industry and steel, copper and aluminum production can be rapidly developed. The Provincial People's Committee, in its instructions, requires all regions to strengthen leadership, break down mystification, mobilize the entire population, make overall plans, and make overall arrangements for labor. Wherever there are copper and aluminum mines, mining and smelting should be started immediately. Short-term training courses should be held to provide technical knowledge for reporting and finding mines, and to implement simultaneous exploration, mining, smelting, and testing, on-site mining, on-site smelting, to quickly achieve results. At the same time, conscientiously summarize the experience of indigenous copper and aluminum smelting methods, organize visits in a timely manner, widely carry out technical exchanges, and strengthen procurement and supply work. All regions and departments must, under the unified leadership of the Party, quickly formulate a comprehensive non-ferrous metal smelting plan focusing on copper and aluminum production, as well as a cooperation plan, and report them level by level for implementation.

Prior to the instructions of the Provincial People's Committee, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a copper smelting on-site meeting at the Dujiabao Copper Mine in Xinyang County, summarizing and promoting Dujiabao's experience in copper smelting using indigenous copper furnaces.

The Dujiabao Copper Mine has established six types of indigenous copper smelting furnaces, concentrating the experience of building copper furnaces from all over the country. For example, the Xinyang-style indigenous copper smelting furnace has the advantage of costing less and being built quickly. It only cost 700 yuan to build five indigenous copper smelting furnaces. The Pinggu adobe furnace can be built in just nine adobe bricks, a straw rope, and twenty minutes. It is also very easy to learn. You can "graduate" in two hours. It only takes forty minutes from loading the ore to producing copper. There is also a flexible and mobile iron barrel furnace, which can be carried by two people. It is smelted wherever there is a copper mine, taking the mine as home, and fully utilizing mineral resources. There is also the Dongchuan-style indigenous furnace with high output (200 catties per day) and low investment (2 yuan); the Jiangning-style indigenous furnace that melts quickly, automatically flows copper water, and automatically flows copper slag; and the Sichuan roasting furnace. Currently, this copper mine has produced more than 12,000 catties of copper.

In order to realize the leap forward plan for copper smelting, the Xinyang Special District studied specific measures at the on-site meeting. It plans to organize a labor force of 40,000 people to vigorously engage in copper smelting, and to open training classes at the Dujiabao Copper Mine to train a large number of copper smelting technicians.

In addition, some good experiences in indigenous copper and aluminum smelting have also emerged in other parts of the province. For example, the staff of the local state-owned Lushan Smelter worked hard for three days and nights in early August and successfully trial-smelted the first furnace of metallic copper. The smelting method is very simple, requires little investment, and the furnace can be built quickly. It only costs 2.5 yuan to build a copper smelting furnace with a daily output of 50 catties, and the furnace can be built and put into production on the same day. The production process is: 50 catties of copper ore is mixed with 25 catties of limestone and 25 catties of coal powder for preliminary smelting, then crushed and water-selected, and then mixed with 15% glass and fired for four hours to produce copper. The women of Xigongren Street in Heping District, Xinxiang City, have also recently established a "March 8th" smelter, which has officially started production, with a daily output of more than 400 catties of copper and aluminum. After identification, it is free of impurities and sand holes, and of excellent quality. They plan to smelt 36,000 kilograms of copper, 28,000 kilograms of aluminum, and 108,000 kilograms of iron this year.

　　河南动员全民冶炼　信阳推广土法炼铜
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：在工农业生产大跃进的形势下，各方面要求机电设备急剧增加，因而所需铜、铝也大量增加，为了迅速解决目前铜、铝生产不足的问题，8月25日河南省人民委员会指示各地大力组织增加铜、铝的生产。目前，一个土法炼铜、铝的群众性生产活动正在各地形成。
    河南省矿藏丰富，在三十六个县一百五十七处有铜矿苗，二十余县有土铝矿可资开采；同时，不少地区也有了土法炼铜、炼铝的经验，根据全党全民办工业办钢铁的经验，铜、铝生产是可以迅速发展起来的。省人民委员会在指示中要求各地加强领导，打破神秘论，全民动手，全面规划，统筹安排劳动力。凡有铜矿、铝矿的地方，应即着手进行开采冶炼；并要求举办短期训练班，给以报矿找矿的技术知识，实行边勘探、边开采、边冶炼、边化验、就地开采、就地冶炼，以迅速做出成绩。同时认真总结土法炼铜、炼铝的经验，及时组织参观，广泛开展技术交流和加强收购供应工作。各地区、各部门还必须在党的统一领导下，迅速制订一个以铜、铝生产为主的有色金属综合冶炼的规划及协作规划，并逐级上报贯彻执行。
    在省人委指示以前，中共信阳地委曾在信阳县杜家畈铜矿召开了炼铜现场会议，总结推广杜家畈的土铜炉炼铜经验。
    杜家畈铜矿建立了六种土法炼铜炉，集中了全国各地建铜炉的经验。如有信阳式的土法炼铜炉，它的优点是花钱少，建炉快。只用了七百元就建成了五个土法炼铜炉。平谷的坯炉，只用九块土坯，一根草绳，二十分钟就可建成；操作也很好学，两个小时就可“出师”，从上矿石到产铜，只用四十分钟。这里有灵巧机动的铁桶炉，两人就可抬动，哪里有铜矿就在哪里炼，以矿为家，充分利用矿藏资源。还有产量高（日产二百市斤）、投资少（二元）的东川式土炉；熔化快，自动流铜水，自动流铜渣的江宁式土炉，以及四川的焙烧炉。现在，这个铜矿已生产出铜一万二千多市斤。
    信阳专区为了实现炼铜跃进计划，在现场会议上研究了具体措施。准备组织四万人的劳动大军大搞炼铜，并在杜家畈铜矿开办训练班，大量培养炼铜技术工人。
    此外，省内其他一些地方也出现了一些土法炼铜、炼铝的好经验。如地方国营鲁山冶炼厂职工，8月上旬苦战了三天零一夜，就试炼成功第一炉金属铜。其冶炼方法很简单，投资少，建炉快，建一座日产五十斤的炼铜炉只需投资二元五角，当天建炉，当天生产。其生产过程是：每五十斤铜矿石，配石灰石二十五斤，煤面二十五斤进行初炼，然后经过粉碎和水选，再配15％的玻璃，烧炼四小时即成。新乡市和平区工人西街妇女，最近也建立了一座“三八”冶炼厂，正式开工生产，日产铜、铝四百余斤。经鉴定，无杂质，无砂眼，质量优良。她们计划今年炼铜三万六千公斤，铝二万八千公斤，铁十万八千公斤。
