Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th: United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld received Jawad, the permanent representative to the United Nations appointed by the government of the Republic of Iraq, on the 5th and announced the recognition of Jawad as the legitimate representative of Iraq to the United Nations.

On the same day, Hammarskjöld also received Abbas, the permanent United Nations "representative" of the Iraqi Faisal dynasty, which had been overthrown by the people, and notified him of the above decision.

Since the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, the United States and Britain have been manipulating the United Nations to refuse to recognize Jawad's legitimate representative status, and supported Abbas's usurpation of Iraq's seat in the United Nations under the name of the "Iraqi-Jordanian Federation Mandate." Recently, as many countries have successively recognized the Republic of Iraq, and even the United States and Britain have had to recognize the Republic of Iraq, the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to obstruct the restoration of the legitimate seat of the Republic of Iraq in the United Nations has finally been declared bankrupt.

    美英排斥伊拉克的阴谋破产
    联合国承认伊拉克新代表
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德5日接见了伊拉克共和国政府任命的常驻联合国代表贾瓦德，宣布承认贾瓦德为伊拉克驻联合国的合法代表。
    哈马舍尔德同一天还接见了已被人民推翻的伊拉克费萨尔王朝的常驻联合国“代表”阿巴斯，把上述决定通知他。
    自从伊拉克共和国成立以来，美英两国一直操纵联合国拒绝承认贾瓦德的合法的代表资格，并且支持阿巴斯在“伊拉克—约旦联邦委任”的名义下窃据伊拉克在联合国中的席位。最近由于许多国家先后承认了伊拉克共和国，甚至美英也不得不承认了伊拉克共和国，美英两国阻挠恢复伊拉克共和国在联合国中的合法席位的阴谋就终于宣告破产。
