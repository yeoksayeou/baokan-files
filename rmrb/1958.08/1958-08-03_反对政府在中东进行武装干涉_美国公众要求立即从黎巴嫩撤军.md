    Oppose Government's Armed Intervention in the Middle East
    American Public Demands Immediate Withdrawal from Lebanon

    (Reported by this newspaper) The "New York Post" published a letter from reader John Ross on July 27, stating that the U.S. military landing in Lebanon had "obvious imperialist characteristics."

    Ross wrote: "Every sensible American knows that the U.S. Marines are staying in Lebanon to protect U.S.-controlled oil wells." He refuted the "hypocrites" among the U.S. authorities who described the action as "protecting Lebanon's independence." The reader angrily questioned: "How can the people of Lebanon enjoy true independence when their natural resources are dominated by foreign monopolies?… The uprising to fight for Lebanon's economic and political independence is being obstructed by the United States—a country that was born in such an uprising. Is there any conscience?"

    The American "New York Times" published a letter from Republican Nicholas Roosevelt on July 19, opposing U.S. armed intervention in the Middle East. Nicholas Roosevelt is a former U.S. diplomat who served as Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Paris and Minister to Hungary.

    In his letter to the "New York Times," Nicholas Roosevelt said that the U.S. Marines landing in Lebanon was "an improper act of interference in internal affairs." The letter pointed out: "Supporting the outgoing and unpopular Chamoun is as worthless as supporting the long-prostrate roadside waste, Chiang Kai-shek."

    Nicholas Roosevelt also demanded that the U.S. government immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

    Xinhua News Agency, New York: A group of Protestant leaders in the United States issued a statement on the 30th opposing interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries and demanding a peaceful resolution to the Middle East issue.

    The statement was drafted by Noeldy, head of the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs, jointly established by the World Council of Churches and the Board of International Affairs; Barnes, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Council of Churches; and several other Protestant leaders. The statement said that church members should support the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

    The statement said that church leaders should call for continuous and rapid efforts to curb and ease the very dangerous tensions in the Middle East by making full use of the United Nations, regular diplomatic channels, and holding top-level meetings within the framework of the Security Council. At the same time, any international conference should fully consider the interests and aspirations of the people of all countries in the region.

    The "American Friends Service Committee" and the "Women's International League for Peace and Freedom" also opposed U.S. armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

    The "Friends Service Committee" said, "Americans are too accustomed to seeing the Middle East as a Western territory… They do not understand the true nature of the rising tide of Arab nationalism, nor do they recognize the legitimate demands of Arab countries that hope to be independent and autonomous. We believe that the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine are maintaining old ideas of ruling for Western interests. Every Marine who lands in Lebanon reinforces this view." The "Friends Service Committee" demanded that the United States stop armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon.

    The "Women's International League for Peace and Freedom" said that U.S. intervention in Lebanon can only exacerbate conflicts and hinder the resolution of the Middle East issue. The League suggested reaching an agreement on "regional arms embargoes, the abolition of all foreign military bases, and the withdrawal of troops from the Near and Middle East." The League's statement said that the U.S. "Middle East policy should no longer rely on military treaties."

    The "Nation" weekly published an editorial saying: "It is unreasonable for the United States to risk the outbreak of World War III to intervene in Lebanon. The embarrassing situation brought about by this decision has strengthened this impression even more.

    "Sending Marines to Lebanon is nothing more than a threat to world peace; it is a serious blow to the United Nations and the principles of collective security."

    The magazine pointed out that the United Nations Charter requires member states of the United Nations not to threaten or use force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. The editorial said: "U.S. intervention is incompatible with these purposes."

    The editorial pointed out: "Lebanon's border is very close to the Soviet Union, just like the northern border of Guatemala is close to Brownsville, Texas (in the United States). Needless to say, if Soviet troops landed in Guatemala at the request of the Arbenz 'pro-Communist' government to protect Guatemala's 'independence and integrity,' it would cause a hysterical reaction in our country."

    The editorial concluded by writing that risking the launch of World War III means that the United States is blatantly disregarding the opinions of upright people around the world. The true face of American morality has been exposed to the world.

### 反对政府在中东进行武装干涉  美国公众要求立即从黎巴嫩撤军

    反对政府在中东进行武装干涉
    美国公众要求立即从黎巴嫩撤军
    本报讯　7月27日的“纽约邮报”发表了读者约翰·罗斯的一封来信，信中指出美军登陆黎巴嫩具有“明显的帝国主义性质”。
    罗斯写道：“一切有头脑的美国人都知道美国海军陆战队呆在黎巴嫩是为了保护美国控制的油井。”他驳斥美国当局的一些“伪君子”把这一行动说成“是在保护黎巴嫩的独立”。这位读者愤怒地质问道：“当黎巴嫩人民的自然资源被外国垄断企业支配的时候，黎巴嫩人民怎么能享有真正的独立呢？……争取黎巴嫩获得经济和政治独立的起义正在受到美国——恰好也是在这样的起义中诞生的国家——的阻挠。有一点良心吗？”
    7月19日的美国“纽约时报”刊载了美国共和党党员尼科拉斯·罗斯福的一封来信，反对美国在中东进行武装干涉。尼科拉斯·罗斯福是美国的前外交官，曾任美国驻巴黎大使馆参赞和驻匈牙利公使。
    尼科拉斯·罗斯福在给“纽约时报”的这封信里说：美国海军陆战队在黎巴嫩登陆是“一种不正当的干涉内政行为”。信里指出：“支持即将下台的和不得人心的夏蒙，和支持长久虚脱的路边废物蒋介石一样毫无价值。”
    尼科拉斯·罗斯福并且要求美国政府立即把军队从黎巴嫩撤走。
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：美国一批新教领袖30日发表声明，反对干涉中东国家内政，并且要求和平解决中东问题。
    这个声明是世界教会理事会和国际布道理事会共同创办的各教会国际事务委员会负责人诺耳迪、世界教会理事会副秘书长巴恩斯和其他几个新教领袖草拟的。这篇声明说，教会人士应当支持不干涉中东国家内政的原则。
    声明说，教会领袖应当要求不断迅速作出努力，遏止和缓和中东的非常危险的紧张局势，办法是充分利用联合国、正规的外交途径以及在安全理事会范围内举行最高级会议。同时，任何国际会议都应当充分考虑到有关地区的各国人民的利益和愿望。
    “美国公谊服务会”和“妇女争取和平和自由国际联盟”也反对美国武装干涉中东国家的内政。
    “公谊服务会”说，“美国人太习惯于把中东看成是西方的领地了……他们不理解日益高涨的阿拉伯民族主义浪潮的真正性质，也不承认希望独立自主的阿拉伯国家的合法要求。我们认为，巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义是在保持为了西方利益而进行统治的老观念。在黎巴嫩登陆的每一个海军陆战队士兵都更加强了人们的这种看法。”“公谊服务会”要求美国停止武装干涉黎巴嫩的内政。
    “妇女争取和平和自由国际联盟”说，美国干涉黎巴嫩只能加剧冲突和妨碍中东问题的解决。这个联盟建议，就“分区禁运武器、取消一切外国军事基地和从中近东撤军”达成协议。联盟发表的声明中说，美国的“中东政策不应该再倚仗军事条约”。
    “民族”周刊发表社论说：“美国甘冒爆发第三次世界大战的危险去干涉黎巴嫩是不理智的。这个决定所带来的狼狈处境更加强了人们的这种印象。
    “派遣海军陆战队去黎巴嫩不外是对世界和平的威胁；这对于联合国和集体安全的原则都是一个严重的打击。”
    杂志指出，联合国宪章要求联合国的会员国不用武力进行威胁，也不要采取任何同联合国宗旨不相容的方式来使用武力。社论说：“美国的干涉是同这些宗旨不相容的。”
    社论指出：“黎巴嫩的边境距离苏联很近，正像危地马拉北部的边境距离（美国的）得克萨斯州布隆斯维尔城一样近。不用说，如果苏联军队一旦根据阿本斯‘亲共’政府的请求登陆来保护危地马拉的‘独立和完整’，在我国一定会引起歇斯底里的反应。”
    社论最后写道，甘冒发动第三次世界大战的危险，这就意味着美国粗暴地无视全世界正直人们的意见。美国道德的真面貌已经暴露在全世界的面前了。
