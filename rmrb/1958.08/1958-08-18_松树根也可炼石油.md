Pine Roots Can Also Be Refined into Petroleum

　　The Fuzhou Artificial Petroleum Plant in Fujian Province has recently adopted the "low-temperature heap dry distillation method" to extract petroleum from peat. According to calculations, one thousand tons of air-dried peat can produce fifty tons of crude oil. Guangze, Yong'an and other counties use the same production method to extract artificial petroleum from pine roots. Yong'an County extracted thirty catties of crude oil from one hundred and fifty catties of pine roots. After fractional distillation, these crude oils can yield 30% gasoline, 20% light diesel, 10% heavy diesel, and 30% asphalt.

　  松树根也可炼石油
    福建省福州人造石油厂，最近采用“低温成堆干馏法”，从泥煤中提炼出石油，据计算，一千吨风干泥煤可产原油五十吨。光泽、永安等县用同样的生产方法，从松树根中提炼出人造石油。永安县从一百五十斤松树根中提炼出三十斤原油。这些原油经过分级蒸馏，可得汽油30％、轻柴油20％、重柴油10％、沥青30％。
