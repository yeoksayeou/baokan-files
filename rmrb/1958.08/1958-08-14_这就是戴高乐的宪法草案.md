This is De Gaulle's Draft Constitution

　　Article 1 of De Gaulle's draft constitution proclaims France to be a "secular" republic. However, one of the first measures De Gaulle took after coming to power was to send a letter to Pope Pius XII at the Vatican, begging for his support. In the letter, De Gaulle said, "I humbly and sincerely request Your Holiness to grant me spiritual support in the execution of my mission." Pius XII replied, saying, "We greatly appreciate your noble letter... We are pleased to grant you our papal apostolic blessing as a guarantee of your future."

　　The clauses of De Gaulle's draft constitution fully expose his plot to seize dictatorial power. According to this draft, the president nominates and appoints the prime minister, and appoints the ministers on the recommendation of the prime minister. When serious disagreements arise between the government and parliament, the president has the power to dissolve parliament. The president also has the power to promulgate laws and can submit these bills to "popular vote" bypassing parliament.

　　Although the draft constitution stipulates that the government can be overthrown by a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly, in order to weaken the power of the parliament, the draft constitution also stipulates that only those who vote in favor of the motion of no confidence are considered to have voted against the government; all other members, even if they abstain, will be considered to have approved the government.

　　Regarding the relationship between France and its overseas territories, the draft constitution proposes that these overseas territories form a so-called "Federation" with France. Article 68 of the draft constitution states that overseas territories participating in the "Federation" enjoy "autonomy," but Article 69 deprives the overseas territories of the basic rights of "foreign policy, defense, monetary, economic and fiscal policy, exploitation of strategic raw materials, administration of justice and higher education." According to this draft, the president becomes the sole link between the people of mainland France and the overseas territories.

　　The current constitution stipulates that the president is elected by members of the two houses of parliament. De Gaulle's draft constitution expands the electorate to include representatives of provincial, municipal, and overseas territories' parliaments. The purpose of this is to ensure that right-wing reactionary forces and paratroopers and generals can manipulate the presidential election and ensure that De Gaulle gets millions of votes.

### 这就是戴高乐的宪法草案

　　这就是戴高乐的宪法草案
    戴高乐的宪法草案第一条标榜法国是“一个非宗教的”共和国。但是，戴高乐上台后的初步措施之一就是致函梵蒂冈罗马教皇庇护十二世，乞求庇护十二世的支持。戴高乐在信里说，“我谨以高度的至诚，请求陛下在我执行我的任务时，赐与我精神上的支持。”庇护十二世在回信中称：“我们十分欣赏你的崇高的信件……我们很高兴赐与我们罗马教皇慈爱的天福，作为你们前途的保证。”
    戴高乐的宪法草案条款充分暴露了戴高乐企图攫取独裁大权的阴谋。根据这个草案，总统提名任命总理，并根据总理的推荐任命各部部长。当政府与议会双方发生严重分歧时，总统有权解散议会。总统并有权颁布法律，而且可以越过议会把这些法案提交“全民表决”。
    宪法草案虽然规定政府能够由国民议会的不信任票推翻，但是为了削弱议会的力量，宪法草案又规定，只有那些投票赞成不信任动议的人，才被认为是投票反对政府，所有其他议员，即使他们弃权，也将被认为是赞成政府的。
    关于法国同它的海外属地的关系，宪法草案提出要这些海外属地同法国成立所谓“联合邦”。宪法草案第六十八条指出参加“联合邦”的海外属地享有“自治”，可是第六十九条就剥夺了海外属地的“外交政策、防御、货币、经济和财政政策、战略原料的开采、司法和高等教育的管理”这些基本权利。按照这个草案，总统成了法国本土与海外属地人民之间唯一的联系。
    现行的宪法规定，由两院议员来选举总统。戴高乐的宪法草案则把参加选举总统的人扩大到包括各省市和海外属地的议会代表。这样做的目的是保证右翼反动势力和伞兵、将领们能够操纵总统选举，确保戴高乐得到几百万张选票。（乐山，漫画选自“人道报”）
