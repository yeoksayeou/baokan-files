Dalian Petroleum Research Institute Breaks Superstitions, Strives for Progress
Sets World Record for Water Gas Synthesis of Oil

(Our newspaper's correspondent Chen Ji reports) Young researchers at the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, breaking down superstitions about the science of capitalist countries, unafraid of opposition and criticism from authoritative scholars and doctors, have closely integrated their water gas synthesis research with the needs of national construction, and are constantly creating new achievements. Now, based on these new research findings, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has established a new factory in Jinzhou Petroleum Plant No. 6, preparing to produce synthetic oil and chemical raw materials in August.

The staff of the Synthesis Research Office of the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute are all young, and are ridiculed by others as a group of young people "without theory, messing around." However, under the education and cultivation of the Party, they are determined to produce oil. After countless failures and thousands of experiments, using a molten iron catalyst and fluidized bed method, they created a new world record of 191 grams of product per cubic meter of raw material gas, exceeding the results of similar research in the United States, Britain, West Germany, and other countries. The entire office has less than one hundred staff members, and it only took six years from the beginning of water gas synthesis research to the completion of the expanded industrial trial this year. In contrast, in the United States after World War II, more than twenty enterprises competed in water gas synthesis research, investing considerable effort each year. The Mobil Oil Development Corporation alone invested more than eight hundred people, and it took fourteen years from the beginning of the research to the completion of the expanded industrial trial last year. However, the product yield of water gas synthesis in the United States is lower than that of the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute. According to the results of similar research by Katz in the United States, the product yield only reached a level of 148 grams of product per cubic meter of raw material gas. This means that the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute has surpassed the research achievements of the United States in fourteen years within six years, and the input of effort was not as much as that of the United States. This research achievement of the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute has attracted the attention of scientists at home and abroad. Scientists from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and India have written to the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute, praising the achievements of this research.

The achievement of water gas synthesis research at the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute plays an important role in the development of China's petroleum and chemical industries. Using the water gas synthesis method to produce crude oil, chemical raw materials, etc., is a new and very important method. At present, China's output of natural petroleum, coal oil refining, and oil shale refining is not high. If the water gas synthesis industry is developed on a large scale in the future, China's oil production will grow rapidly. The results of water gas synthesis research have proved that only five tons of coal can produce one ton of crude oil, chemical raw materials, and other products. These products can be made into gasoline, diesel, synthetic fibers, rayon, plastics, etc., and can also obtain civilian gas and other by-products. Establishing a water gas synthesis industry requires less investment, the raw materials are inexhaustible, the equipment can all be manufactured domestically, and the process operation is not difficult to master. Whether it is coal—low-quality coal, semi-coke, or natural gas—can be used as raw materials, unlike coal oil refining and oil shale refining, which are restricted by raw materials. After long-term research and experiments by the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute, certain difficulties in process equipment and technical operations have been resolved. Due to the advanced methods adopted and the good activity of the catalyst, the production efficiency can be very high, and the product quality is also better. Using the water gas synthesis method, both large factories with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons of products and small factories with an annual output of two or three thousand tons of products can be built; both liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel can be produced, and chemical products and civilian gas can also be produced. This is an important direction for the comprehensive utilization of coal and natural gas, and it is also a new path for the combined development of large, medium, and small-scale petroleum and chemical industries.

The water gas synthesis research work can make such an important contribution to China's socialist construction cause, mainly because it has implemented the policy of serving production through scientific research. In the course of the research, some scientists and researchers who considered themselves to have high theoretical knowledge once opposed the in-depth development of this research work and disagreed with expanding industrial trials. They believed that theoretical research should be done well before expanding trial work could be done; and they used the authoritative conclusions and scientific literature of water gas synthesis research in the United States and Britain to determine that it was impossible for China to build a water gas synthesis industry, saying, "If Americans can't do it, how can we do it?" However, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and industrial departments, the young researchers of the Water Gas Synthesis Research Office of the Dalian Petroleum Research Institute, broke down superstitions about authority, unafraid of failure and opposition, and worked hard to serve socialist construction, adhered to the work of expanding trials, and finally created new achievements. While carrying out small-scale trials and medium-scale trials, they also began to expand their research results to industry. Now they are continuing to conduct research and experiments, striving for more and better new achievements, making full preparations for the establishment of China's new water gas synthesis industry, and striving to comprehensively surpass capitalist countries in the field of water gas synthesis research within a few years.

    大连石油研究所破除迷信力争上游
    创水煤气合成制油世界纪录
    本报讯　记者陈迹报道：中国科学院大连石油研究所年轻的研究人员，破除对资本主义国家科学的迷信，不怕权威学者、博士的反对和指责，在水煤气合成研究工作中紧紧结合国家建设的需要，不断创造出新的成果；现在中央石油工业部根据这一研究的新成果，在锦州石油六厂建立起新厂房，准备在8月间生产出合成石油和化工原料。
    大连石油研究所合成研究室工作人员都很年轻，被别人讥笑为一群“没有理论、乱搞一通”的小伙子；但在党的教育和培养下，他们一心要想搞出石油来，经过无数次的失败和成千次的试验，采用熔铁催化剂和流体化床法，创造出每立方公尺原料气制成一百九十一克产品的世界新纪录，超过美、英、西德等国家同型研究的结果。全室工作人员不到一百人，从开始研究水煤气合成到今年完成扩大工业试验，只花费六年时间；而美国在第二次世界大战以后，有二十多个企业竞相研究水煤气合成，每年投入很大力量，光是一个美孚石油发展公司就投入八百多人，从开始研究到去年完成扩大工业试验，却花费十四年时间。但是美国水煤气合成的产品率，却低于大连石油研究所。根据美国凯兹的同型研究的结果：产品率只达到每立方公尺原料气制成一百四十八克产品的水平。这就是说，大连石油研究所在6年时间内就赶过了美国十四年时间内获得的研究成果，而投入的力量却没有美国多。大连石油研究所这一研究成果，引起了国内外科学家的重视。英、美、法、印度等国的一些科学家，写信给大连石油研究所，赞扬这项研究的成就。
    大连石油研究所水煤气合成研究的成就，对于我国发展石油工业、化学工业起着重要作用。利用水煤气合成方法，制取原油、化工原料等，是一个新的途径，非常重要的方法。我国目前天然石油、煤炼油、油母页岩炼油的产量都还不高；如果今后大量发展水煤气合成工业，我国石油产量将会有迅速的增长。水煤气合成研究的结果证明：只要五吨煤，就可生产出一吨原油、化工原料等产品。这些产品可以制成车用汽油、柴油、合成纤维、人造棉胶、塑料等，还可以获得民用煤气等副产品。建立水煤气合成工业，投资不多，原料取之不尽，设备都可由国内制造，工艺操作也不难掌握。无论是煤——劣质煤、半焦或者天然气都可作为原料，不像煤炼油、油母页岩炼油那样要受原料的限制。经过大连石油研究所长期的研究和试验，某些工艺设备、技术操作的困难都获得解决。由于采用的方法先进，催化剂活性好，生产效能可以很高，产品质量也较好。利用水煤气合成方法，既能建成年产几十万吨产品的大型工厂，也能建成年产两、三千吨产品的小型工厂；既可以生产出汽油、柴油等液体燃料，又可以生产出化工产品、民用煤气等。这是综合利用煤、天然气的一个重要方向，也是石油、化学工业大、中、小型相结合发展的新道路。
    水煤气合成研究工作，能够对我国社会主义建设事业有这样重要的贡献，主要是因为贯彻了科学研究为生产服务的方针。在研究的过程中，有些自认为理论高的科学家、研究员，曾经反对这项研究工作的深入开展，不同意扩大工业试验；认为要先搞好理论研究，才能做扩大试验的工作；并且以美国、英国水煤气合成研究的权威结论和科学文献，来断定我国不可能建成水煤气合成工业，说什么“美国人都搞不成，我们怎么搞成？”但是大连石油研究所水煤气合成研究室年轻的研究人员，在党的领导下，在中国科学院和产业部门的支持下，破除对于权威的迷信，不怕失败和反对，努力为社会主义建设服务，坚持扩大试验的工作，终于创造出新的成果。在进行小型试验、中型试验的同时，又把研究成果开始扩大到工业上去。现在他们还在继续进行研究、试验，争取更多更好的新成就，为建立我国新的水煤气合成工业而进行充分准备，并且要在几年时间内在水煤气合成研究领域里全面地超过资本主义国家。
