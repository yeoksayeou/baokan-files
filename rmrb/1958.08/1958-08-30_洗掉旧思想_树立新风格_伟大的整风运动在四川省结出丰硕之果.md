    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 29th: Reporter Shao Tingjun reports: The nationwide rectification movement in Sichuan Province was victoriously concluded in mid-August.

    The great rectification movement has washed away the dust in interpersonal relationships, establishing a brand-new relationship between leaders and the led. The people of the province, using the methods of big airing, big debate, and big-character posters, conducted direct inspections, criticisms, and education of the work and style of over 800,000 cadres above the township level throughout the province. In provincial agencies, factories, and schools alone, over 60 million big-character posters were put up, and the number of posters put up by farmers and urban residents throughout the province is impossible to count. These big-character posters, like raging fire, burned the rightists and also burned the "three winds" and "five airs" of the cadres, making cadres on all fronts deeply aware of the serious harm of the three winds, five airs, and detachment from the masses, and rapidly changing their style. Now, it has become a general practice for cadres to go deep into the masses, participate in labor, cultivate experimental plots, and hold on-site meetings. Thousands of factory leaders have moved their offices to the workshops, and factory directors and Party committee secretaries are working as workers, working half a day and laboring half a day, living with the workers in sheds, and eating from the same pot. Many county Party committees or rural work departments have long moved to agricultural cooperatives or water conservancy and drought resistance construction sites to work, and county Party secretaries and county heads have concurrently served as chairmen of agricultural cooperatives. This trend of leading cadres going deep into the grassroots, cultivating experimental plots, has spread to all departments such as commerce, culture, and education. Leading cadres appear as ordinary laborers, taking the lead and setting an example, which not only greatly inspires the labor enthusiasm of the masses; but also enables them to discover and solve some long-standing problems and key problems in production and work in a timely manner, thereby promoting the development of production and work.

    Forever following the Communist Party and resolutely taking the socialist road are the firm beliefs established by the entire people in the rectification. Workers who had been tainted with bourgeois dust and had low awareness in the past have undergone great changes through the rectification. In the past, a quarter of the workers in the Chengdu Public-Private Joint Venture Dagong Iron Factory had worked in underground factories. After special debates on "freedom and discipline" and "working for whom," the awareness of these workers has been greatly improved. Not only has no one gone to engage in underground factories anymore, but they also go to work as soon as the preparation bell rings every day, with an attendance rate of 98%. Before the rectification, some agricultural cooperative members made trouble to withdraw from the cooperative, demanded grain, and were unwilling to participate in cooperative labor, indulging in individual production or commercial speculation. However, after special debates on "taking the socialist road or taking the capitalist road" and after studying the general line of socialist construction, especially after seeing the vigorous development of agricultural production this year, they are no longer willing to be spontaneous forces of capitalism, and they are determined to take the socialist road. Many intellectuals with bourgeois ideas regard clearing their bad thoughts and right-leaning mistakes as rebirth and transformation. They have never been so close to the Party and loved the Party as they are today, and they are all vying to formulate red and expert plans, determined to thoroughly transform themselves and become red and expert socialist red laborers. Now, going all out, aiming high, surpassing the advanced, striving for advancement, taking pride in being advanced, and taking shame in being backward have become the new social ethos. The communist idea of "one for all, all for one" has been greatly promoted.

    The great liberation of people's minds has promoted the leap forward in socialist construction. This is the most prominent harvest of this rectification movement. The rectification and the study of the general line have enabled people to break superstitions, eliminate feelings of inferiority, and establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to create. In the first half of this year, more than 10,000 new products were successfully trial-produced throughout the province. Many products not only reached the level of advanced regions in the country, but also reached the international level. Among them, 231 products caught up with or exceeded the level of capitalist countries. The province's industrial output value plan for the first half of this year has been overfulfilled, with a total output value increase of 26% compared with the same period last year, and the total output value in July increased by 52% compared with July last year. As of July, more than 420,000 newly built factories and mines throughout the province have been put into production. The work in agriculture, commerce, culture, education, health, and other fields has also seen a scene of galloping horses. Both spring crops and early rice have achieved unprecedented harvests this year. Spring crops increased by 20% compared with last year, and early rice increased by more than double. There are already 14 early rice thousand-jin counties and cities on the West Sichuan Plain. Eighty counties and cities throughout the province have popularized primary school education, seventy counties and cities have achieved having middle schools in every township, and thirty-two counties have basically eliminated illiteracy. Promoting the great leap forward in socialist construction is the purpose of the rectification and also the result of the rectification.

### 洗掉旧思想　树立新风格  伟大的整风运动在四川省结出丰硕之果

　　洗掉旧思想　树立新风格
    伟大的整风运动在四川省结出丰硕之果
    本报成都电　记者邵挺军报道：四川省的全民整风运动，已在8月中旬宣告胜利结束。
    伟大的整风运动，冲刷了人和人关系中的灰尘，使领导和被领导之间建立了崭新的关系。全省人民运用大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，在大整大改中对全省八十多万个乡以上干部的工作和作风，进行了直接的检查和批评教育。仅全省机关、工厂、学校贴出的大字报就有六千万张以上，全省农民和城市居民出的大字报可就无法统计清楚了。这些大字报像烈火一样烧了右派分子，也烧了干部的“三风”、“五气”，使各条战线上的干部都深刻的认识了三风五气、脱离群众的严重危害性，迅速的转变作风。现在，干部深入群众、参加劳动、种试验田、开现场会议等已成普遍风气。数以千计的工厂领导人把办公室搬到了车间，厂长、党委书记兼做工人，半日工作半日劳动，和工人同住工棚，同吃大锅饭。许多中共县委会或农村工作部早就搬到农业合作社或水利、抗旱工地去办公，县委书记、县长兼任了农业社社长。领导干部这种深入基层、种试验田的风气，已经发展到了商业、文教等所有部门。领导干部以普通劳动者的姿态出现，身先士卒，以身作则，不但大大激励了群众的劳动热情；而且能够及时地发现和解决一些长期没有解决的问题和生产、工作中的关键问题，从而推动了生产、工作的发展。
    永远跟着共产党，坚决走社会主义道路，是全体人民在整风中树立的坚定信念。过去在思想上染上资产阶级灰尘和觉悟不高的工人，经过整风已有很大转变。成都市公私合营大公铁工厂过去有四分之一的工人到地下工厂去做过工。经过“自由和纪律”、“为谁劳动”的专题辩论后，这些工人的觉悟大大提高，不但再没有人去搞地下工厂了，而且每天预备铃一响就上了工，出勤率达到98％。整风前，一部分农业社员闹退社、闹缺粮，不愿参加社内劳动，热中于个人生产或商业投机活动。但是经过“走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路”的专题辩论和在学习社会主义建设总路线以后，特别是在看到了今年农业生产蓬勃发展以后，他们再也不愿当资本主义自发势力了，他们坚决要走社会主义道路。许多具有资产阶级思想的知识分子，都把清算自己的坏思想和右倾错误，当作是再生，是脱胎换骨。他们从来没有过像今天这样靠拢党、热爱党，个个争先订出红专计划，下决心要彻底改造自己，做个红透专深的社会主义的红色劳动者。现在，鼓足干劲，力争上游，超先进，争先进，以先进为荣，以落后为耻，已成为社会的新风气。“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想，大大发扬起来了。
    人们的思想大解放，推动了社会主义建设飞跃前进，这是这次整风运动最突出的收获。整风和总路线的学习，使人们破除了迷信，打掉了自卑感，树立了敢想、敢说、敢做、敢创造的共产主义风格。今年上半年全省试制成功的新产品有一万多件，很多产品不仅达到全国先进地区水平，而且达到了国际水平，其中有二百三十一种产品赶上或超过资本主义国家的水平。今年上半年全省工业产值计划已超额完成，总产值比去年同期增长26％，7月份总产值比去年7月增长52％。截至7月为止，全省已有四十二万多个新建厂矿投入了生产。农业、商业、文教卫生等各方面的工作，也出现了万马奔腾的局面。今年小春作物和早稻都获得了空前丰收，小春作物比去年增产20％，早稻增产一倍多，川西平原上已有十四个早稻千斤县、市。全省已有八十个县、市普及了小学教育，七十个县、市做到了乡乡有中学，三十二个县基本上扫除了文盲。促使社会主义事业大跃进是整风的目的，也是整风的结果。
