    Raobu Commune Sets Up Ball Bearing Factory
    Gu Jianglu, Tang Zhiguang
    In Raobu Agricultural Commune, Boyang County, Jiangxi Province, there is such a "strange" factory. It has no lathes or engineering technicians, but it produces high-quality ball bearings. Ball bearings are an indispensable mechanical part for realizing mechanization in rural areas. They have a wide range of uses and are needed not only for transportation tools, water lifting tools, and some new farm tools, but also for many power machines. Carts equipped with ball bearings are especially light, flexible, have a large load capacity, high speed, and require less labor. Manufacturing ball bearings is not an easy task. In the past, people always thought that they could only be produced in modern factories with good conditions and equipment. However, now they are appearing in a factory run by an ordinary agricultural commune.
    On July 8th, we visited this "strange" factory. In a factory building under construction, there were four machines operated manually. These are their so-called "machine tools" for manufacturing ball bearings. One is a gear hand drill for drilling holes, one is a rocking stone wheel for grinding and polishing the ball bearing shells, and the other two are like pliers. Standing beside and operating these machines was Hu Yizhang, a commune member and local blacksmith. He was concentrating on making ball bearing shells, drilling holes with the hand drill for a while, and then using his hands to rock the stone gear to grind and polish it. It seemed that his skills were very proficient. However, a little over a month ago, he was still an ordinary rural blacksmith, a "local blacksmith" who had never been to school or worked in a factory for even half a day. He held up the ball bearings he made, pointed to the large flatbed cart installed with ball bearings, and happily said to us, "At first, I could only produce half a ball bearing a day, but now I can produce one and a half a day. I have already made more than thirty."
    Speaking of Raobu Commune running a factory, there is a tortuous process! In May of this year, when the Boyang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call to "realize mechanization ahead of schedule and welcome the summer harvest and summer planting," the commune thought that all the ball bearings on the carts would be supplied by the county, so they looked upwards, and no one took the initiative to think of a solution. As time passed day by day, the ball bearings had not yet been seen, and a large pile of frames for flatbed carts, two-wheeled carts, and handcarts had been made in the commune, but they were all "sleeping" there because there were no ball bearings. At this time, they began to get anxious. The township sent commune members to large cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Nanchang to buy ball bearings, but these commune members all returned empty-handed. What to do? Some people were discouraged and their confidence in achieving mechanization wavered. They said, "Mechanization is good, but ball bearings cannot be bought." Based on this situation, the Township Party Committee held a special meeting to discuss whether they could manufacture the ball bearings themselves if they could not buy them. After some debate, they finally unified their thinking within the Party. Everyone believed that "as long as there is determination, an iron rod can be ground into a needle." Therefore, the Township Party Committee issued a call to the whole township to "start from scratch and trial-produce ball bearings ourselves." As soon as this call was issued, it immediately sparked discussion throughout the township. Some said, "It's really overestimating one's abilities, a toad wants to eat swan meat." "Since the creation of the world, no one has ever heard of rural people being able to make machines." However, these arguments were all refuted by the revolutionaries. They quickly bought a set of manually operated machines from Nanchang and organized blacksmith workers to visit other places. After returning, they immediately began trial production. In the first trial production, because everyone had no experience and no design blueprints, they encountered many unimaginable difficulties, but with collective effort, they finally made the first ball bearing. However, this ball bearing could not turn when installed on the wheels. Some people began to make sarcastic remarks, "Iron blacksmith, iron blacksmith, like a piece of wood, what can you make?" At this time, even Hu Yizhang, who was unusually enthusiastic about manufacturing ball bearings, felt somewhat discouraged after hearing these words. Tao Yurong, Secretary of the Raobu Township Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, immediately convened everyone for research and helped to find the reasons for the failure. In this way, after the second and third trial productions, they finally succeeded.
    After the successful trial production of ball bearings, the masses of the whole commune were overjoyed. "Local experts" and "local engineers" from nearby hundreds of miles around also came to visit. They expressed their admiration for Raobu Commune's ability to manufacture ball bearings under very simple equipment conditions.
    Speaking of this, some people may ask: What is the quality of ball bearings made by local methods? According to what we have seen with our own eyes, although the ball bearings made by local methods are not as smooth and bright as those produced in large factories, their quality is very good; at the same time, their cost is much lower than that of ball bearings produced in large urban factories. The ball bearings manufactured by themselves use waste steel raw materials contributed by commune members, and each one only costs more than two yuan; while buying a ball bearing on the market costs more than twenty yuan, and it is not easy to buy. Because Raobu Commune can produce ball bearings themselves, the commune announced mechanization on July 1st. (Originally published in Jiangxi Daily, slightly abridged)

    饶埠社办起滚珠工厂
    辜江芦　汤之光
    在江西省波阳县的饶埠农业社里，有这样一个“奇怪”的工厂，它没有车床，也没有工程技术人员，可是，它却生产出一种质量很好的滚珠。滚珠，是目前农村实现车子化不可缺少的一种机械零件，它的用途很广，不仅运输工具、提水工具和某些新式农具上需要，就是在许多动力机械上也是不可缺少的。凡是安装了滚珠轴承的车子，行驶特别轻巧、灵活、载重量大，速度快，而且花的劳动力少。制造滚珠本来不是一件容易的事情，过去人们总认为只有在条件、设备很好的现代化工厂才能生产，可是，现在却在一个普通的农业社办的工厂里出现了。
    7月8日，我们参观了这个“奇怪”的工厂。在一个正在兴建的厂房内，有四台用手工操作的机器，这就是他们制造滚珠的所谓“机床”其中有一部是用来钻孔用的齿轮手摇钻，一部是将滚珠壳磨平磨光的摇石轮，还有两部就是像老虎钳那样的捉钳了。站在一旁操作这几部机器的是一个名叫胡义章的农业社员、土铁匠，他聚精会神的做滚珠壳，一会儿手摇钻机钻孔，一会儿又用手摇动石齿轮，把它磨光磨平，看来他的技术是很熟练的。可是，他在一个多月以前，还是一个农村普通的土铁匠，一个从来没有进过学校门，也没有在工厂呆过半天的“土铁匠”。他拿着自己制造出来的滚珠，又指着安装好了滚珠的大板车，高兴地对我们说：“开初每天只能生产半个，现在一天能生产一个半了，目前已做了三十多个。”
    说起饶埠社办厂，还有一段曲折的过程呢！今年5月间，当中共波阳县委提出“提前实现车子化，迎接夏收夏种”的号召时，社里满以为车子上的滚珠全部由县里供应，因此，眼睛向上，谁也不去主动想办法。这样时间一天天的过去了，滚珠还没有见到影子，社里的大板车、双轮车、手推车等架子做了一大堆，可是因为没有滚珠都在那里“睡大觉”。这时，他们才发起急来，乡里派出社员奔赴上海、武汉、南昌等大城市去购买滚珠，但是这些社员都一一扑空而归。怎么办呢？有的人泄气了，对实现车子化的信心发生了动摇，他们说：“车子化好是好，就是滚珠买不到。”乡党委根据这种情况，举行了一次专门会议，讨论买不到滚珠，是不是可以自己制造？经过一番争论以后，终于在党内统一了思想，大家认为：“只要有决心，铁杵也能磨成针。”于是，乡党委向全乡发出了“白手起家，自己试制滚珠”的号召。这一号召发出以后，立即在全乡议论开了，有的说：“真是自不量力，癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。”“从盘古开天地以来，就没有听说过乡下人能做机器的。”但是，这些论调都一一受到了革命派的批驳，他们很快的从南昌买来了一套手工操作机器，并且组织铁匠工人到外地参观，回来以后即开始了试制工作。在第一次试制过程中，由于大家没有经验，又没有设计蓝图，因此遇到了许多难以想像的困难，但是在集体努力下，终于做成了第一个滚珠。可是这个滚珠装在车轮上却转不动，有的人便在旁边说起风凉话来：“铁木匠，铁木匠，像个木头样，你们还能做出个啥东西来。”这时，就连制造滚珠异常积极的胡义章，听到这些话后也有些灰心。中共饶埠乡党委书记陶裕荣同志立即召集大家进行研究，并且帮助找出失败的原因，这样，经过了第二次、第三次试制，最后终于获得了成功。
    滚珠试制成功以后，全社群众个个欢欣鼓舞，附近方圆百里的“土专家”、“土工程师”也都纷纷来到这里参观，他们对饶埠社能够在设备条件十分简陋的情况下制造出滚珠来，表示十分钦佩。
    说到这里，也许有人要问：用土办法制造的滚珠，到底质量如何呢？根据我们亲眼所见，土法制成的滚珠，虽然不如大工厂生产的滚珠那样光滑雪亮，但是它的质量却很好；同时，它的成本比起城市大工厂生产的滚珠要低得多。自己制造的滚珠，用的是社员献出的废钢铁原料，每个只需要两块多钱；而在市场上买一个滚珠却需要二十多元，而且不容易买到。饶埠社由于自己能够生产滚珠，7月1号那天，社里宣布了车子化。　（原载江西日报，略有删节）
