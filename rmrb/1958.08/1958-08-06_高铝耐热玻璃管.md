    High-Alumina Heat-Resistant Glass Tubing
    This glass tubing is much cheaper than seamless steel pipes and can withstand a pressure of 40 kilograms per square centimeter.
    The Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory has successfully trial-produced high-alumina heat-resistant glass tubing. This type of glass tubing has high resistance to chemical erosion and mechanical strength. It has special properties such as small expansion, high strength, acid and alkali resistance, and resistance to rapid cooling and heating. It can withstand a pressure of 40 kilograms per square centimeter, and has a wide range of uses in construction. It can replace various metal pipes, saving a large amount of steel pipes and non-ferrous metal pipes. It can also be used as conveying pipelines in chemical, petroleum, food, construction and other industrial departments, and in farmland irrigation.
    This large glass tubing can replace seamless steel pipes, and its cost is lower than that of seamless steel pipes. The cost of seamless steel pipes is 816 to 940 yuan per ton; if this glass tubing is produced in large quantities, the estimated cost is only about 250 yuan per ton. The specific gravity of this glass tubing is small, only one-third of that of seamless steel pipes, that is, one ton of glass tubing is equal to the use value of three tons of seamless steel pipes. Therefore, the value comparison between this glass tubing and seamless steel pipes is approximately equal to nine to one.

    高铝耐热玻璃管
    这种玻璃管比无缝钢管便宜得多，每平方公分的耐压力为四十公斤。
    秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂试制高铝耐热玻璃管成功。这种玻璃管，具有很高的抗化学侵蚀性和机械强度。它的膨胀性小，强度大，耐酸碱，耐急冷、急热等特殊性能；它每平方公分的耐压力达四十公斤，在建设上的用途很广；它可代替各种金属管道，节省大量钢管和有色金属管；它还可以用在化学、石油、食品、建筑等工业部门和农田水利上做输送道管。
    这种大型玻璃管可以代替无缝钢管，而它的成本比无缝钢管低。无缝钢管每吨成本为八百一十六元至九百四十元；这种玻璃管如果大量生产，预计每吨成本仅二百五十元左右；这种玻璃管的比重小，仅等于无缝钢管的三分之一，即每吨玻璃管等于三吨无缝钢管的使用价值。因此，这种玻璃管与无缝钢管价值比较约等于九比一。
