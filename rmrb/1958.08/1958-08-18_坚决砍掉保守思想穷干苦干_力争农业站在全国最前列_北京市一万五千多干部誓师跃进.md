　　Resolutely Cut Off Conservative Thinking and Work Hard to Achieve Agricultural Leap Forward
　　Strive to Make Agriculture Stand at the Forefront of the Country
　　Beijing's 15,000 Cadres Vow to Leap Forward

　　(Our Newspaper's report) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a cadre meeting of more than 15,000 people yesterday (the 17th), criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of leaders at all levels. They decided to, based on mobilizing the masses to engage in extensive airing of views, big blooming, and big debates, work hard to strive for a bumper autumn harvest and a large increase in wheat production next year, and to make suburban agricultural production stand at the forefront of the country. Comrade Peng Zhen made important instructions at the meeting.

　　Although there has been considerable progress in Beijing's suburbs this year, the average wheat yield per mu is only 141 jin. The recent facts of many areas with relatively poor conditions launching high-yield "satellites" have powerfully educated the cadres and farmers in the suburbs. In the past two months, districts and the vast townships and cooperatives have been urgently mobilized, rising up to catch up, and投入投 themselves into the crucial battle of striving for high wheat yields and agricultural abundance.

　　Comrade Peng Zhen spoke at the meeting, pointing out that although suburban agricultural production has made great progress this year, it is still relatively backward compared with advanced areas in the country when examined by the standards of the general line of socialist construction. At present, it is necessary to strengthen field management before the autumn harvest, and it is necessary to seize the planting of autumn wheat and plant as much wheat as possible. This is the key issue in agricultural production at present.

　　Peng Zhen then pointed out that to make agriculture leap forward, it is necessary to continue to break superstitions, break the superstition of old experiences, break the superstition of books, of agronomists, and of agricultural "operating procedures". Peng Zhen said, in the past, who in the world had the experience of producing more than 7,000 jin of wheat per mu, or more than 30,000 jin of rice per mu? Which book, which agronomist, told us this knowledge? Which "operating procedure" enabled our wheat and rice to reach such and even higher yields? The past experiences, knowledge in books, opinions of scientists, and "operating procedures" should be analyzed and criticized. Whatever can make us increase production more, faster, better, and more economically should be adopted and promoted, and what is not applicable should be criticized and discarded. Now, the most important thing is to summarize and introduce the experiences and concrete measures of high yields from all over the country and from various districts and townships in our city to everyone in a timely manner.

　　Peng Zhen said that in the past, suburban agricultural production neither universally and earnestly engaged in experimental fields, nor was the mass line followed sufficiently, and some production targets were not even truly discussed by the masses. This time, large-scale airing of views, blooming, and debates must be launched on wheat production targets and various measures. Everyone should use their brains and offer suggestions. Decisions should be made after serious and full discussion by the masses. Only in this way can it be realized with one heart and one mind, and can there be a universal leap forward and a large increase in production. Peng Zhen suggested that each district, each cooperative, each team, and each group should engage in experimental fields.

　　Finally, Peng Zhen emphasized that the spirit of working hard must be implemented in the work, and we must rely on our own efforts and not have dependent thinking. For example, to transport a large amount of fertilizer to the fields, we must improve our own transportation tools; if there is not enough labor, we must improve our own farm tools and strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, on the one hand, we must learn from the advanced experience of others, and on the other hand, we must create our own advanced experience. Everyone must dare to think and dare to do, and everyone must engage in experimental fields.

　　After Comrade Peng Zhen spoke, the district party secretaries of various suburban districts spoke at the meeting one after another, examining their conservative thinking and putting forward preliminary targets and main concrete measures for striving for high wheat yields next year.

　　Cui Xudong, Secretary of the Shunyi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, used the example of his district to illustrate that in order to strive for high yields, it is first necessary to establish high-yield thinking. He said that 1957 was an unprecedented year of bumper harvests in Shunyi District, but the yield per mu was only over 200 jin, because the Party committee leading the work in this district at that time only had the thinking of producing 200 jin per mu. This year's autumn fields have the hope of producing 600 jin per mu. This is the result of the Party committee's constant ideological revolution this year, establishing the thinking of producing 600 jin per mu.

　　Shan Zhaoxiang, Secretary of the Chaoyang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that Chaoyang District's wheat yield per mu this year is half that of Henan, which is due to the mistake of relying on others. This district is close to Beijing city and is a concentrated industrial area with very good conditions. Therefore, when they encounter difficulties in their work, they do not mobilize the masses to solve the problems independently, but want to rely on foreign aid and reach out to the state. The higher levels influence the lower levels, the district relies on the city, the township relies on the district, the cooperative relies on the township, and the members rely on the cooperative. This shackles the thinking of the masses and cannot mobilize the masses to go all out and strive for the upstream. Shan Zhaoxiang said: We must accept this lesson and be the masters of favorable conditions, and we must never be slaves to favorable conditions again.

　　The district party secretaries all talked about their concrete measures to ensure high wheat yields at the meeting. Tongzhou District, with a population of 400,000, initially plans to plant 400,000 mu of wheat, expanding the wheat fields by 140,000 mu compared to last year; deeply plowing the land to at least one foot and five inches; applying 200,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and currently 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu has been accumulated, completing all fertilizer accumulation tasks before August 25; using at least 60 jin of high-quality seeds per mu; leveling the land well, with canals above and machine wells below, guaranteeing water for irrigation whenever the land is dry. In Zhoukoudian District, which has many mountains, little land, and insufficient water sources, wheat fields will also account for half of the total cultivated area, that is, expanding from 175,000 mu to 200,000 mu; deeply plowing one foot and seven inches to two feet; every township and team has fertilizer factories, applying 100,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and densely planting more than 40 jin of seeds per mu; leveling the land to achieve garden-like fields; opening mountains to find springs, digging wells to utilize groundwater for irrigation. Other districts also put forward preliminary targets and measures at the meeting.

　　At the meeting, the district secretaries particularly focused on talking about the planning of extensively planting experimental fields. For example, the district, township, cooperative, and team cadres in Tongzhou District have initially decided to engage in 10,000 mu of high-yield experimental fields. The 50 mu of experimental fields that the cadres directly under the District Committee have already begun to plant are prepared to be deeply plowed five or six feet, apply 300,000 jin of base fertilizer, and strive for even higher yields.

　　At the meeting, the suburban districts launched a friendly competition, all expressing their desire to strive for first place.

　　The district, township, cooperative, and team cadres who attended the meeting, after listening to Comrade Peng Zhen's report and seeing the districts launching competitions, were all eager to try and full of fighting spirit. Some districts immediately continued to hold meetings in the same place after the meeting to study action plans.

　　At the end of this oath-taking meeting for the great agricultural leap forward, Comrade Peng Zhen requested that all departments of industry, capital construction, commerce, education, culture, and political and legal affairs must, according to the new situation in agriculture, go all out and catch up immediately.

　　坚决砍掉保守思想穷干苦干
　　力争农业站在全国最前列
　　北京市一万五千多干部誓师跃进
      本报讯　中共北京市委昨天
  （17日）举行了一万五千多人的干部大会，批判了各级领导的右倾保守思想，决定在发动群众大鸣大放大辩论的基础上，穷干苦干，力争秋季大丰收，和明年小麦大增产，力争郊区农业生产站在全国的最前列。彭真同志在大会上作了重要指示。
    北京郊区今年虽然也有不少进步，但是小麦平均亩产量才一百四十一斤。最近许多条件较差的地区纷纷发射高产“卫星”的事实，极其有力地教育了郊区的干部和农民。在近两个月中，各区和广大的
  乡、社，已经紧急动员起来，奋起直追，投入力争小麦高产——农业丰产的关键的战斗。
    彭真同志在大会上讲了话，他指出今年郊区的农业生产虽然有很大进步，但是用社会主义建设总路线的标准来检查，与全国先进地区相比较，还是比较落后的。现在必须加强秋收前的田间管理工作，必须抓紧秋小麦的种植，要尽可能多种小麦，这是当前农业生产方面的关键问题。
    彭真接着指出，要使农业大跃进，必须继续破除迷信。破除对老经验的迷信。打破对书本子的迷信，对农学家的迷信，对农业“操作规程”的迷信。彭真说，过去世界上有谁有过亩产七千多斤小麦、亩产三万几千斤稻谷的经验？有那个书本、那个农学家告诉过我们这种知识？有那个“操作规程”使我们的小麦稻子达到这样以至更高的产量呢？对过去的经验、书本上的知识、科学家的意见和“操作规程”，应该有分析，有批判，凡能够使我们多快好省地增产的，应该采用、发扬，不适用的要批判抛弃。现在最重要的是把全国各地以及本市各区各乡的丰产经验和具体措施，及时地总结介绍给大家。
    彭真说，郊区农业生产，过去既没有普遍认真地搞试验田，同时走群众路线也很不够，甚至有些生产指标都没有真正经过群众讨论。这次关于小麦生产指标和各项措施都必须展开大鸣、大放、大辩论，人人动脑筋，个个出主意，要经过群众认真地、充分地讨论后作出决定，这样才能万众一心地把它实现，才能普遍地大跃进大增产。彭真建议每个区、每个社、每个队、每个组都搞试验田。
    最后，彭真强调指出，在工作中必须贯彻穷干苦干的精神，要自力更生，不要有依赖思想。譬如要把大量的肥料运到地里，就要自己改良运输工具；劳动力不够，就要自己改良农具，加强互助协作。同时一方面要学习别人的先进经验，另一方面还要创造自己的先进经验，每个人都要敢想、敢做，每个人都搞试验田。
    彭真同志讲话以后，郊区各区的区委书记都相继在会上发言。检查了保守思想，提出了争取明年小麦高产的初步指标和主要的具体措施。
    中共顺义区委书记崔旭东用本区的实例说明：要想争得高产，首先要树立高产思想。他说，1957年是顺义区空前的丰收年，但亩产量只有二百多斤，因为当时领导这个区工作的党委只有亩产二百斤的思想。今年的秋田有亩产六百斤的希望。这是今年党委经过不断的思想革命，树立了亩产六百斤思想的结果。
    中共朝阳区委书记单昭祥说，朝阳区今年小麦亩产量比河南低一半，就是吃了依赖思想的亏。这个区靠近北京城，又是个工业集中的地方，条件很好。因此，他们在工作中遇到困难不是发动群众，自力更生地去解决问题，而是想依赖外援，向国家伸手。上行下效，区依赖市，乡就依赖区，社又依赖乡，社员又依赖社，这就束缚了群众的思想，不能发动群众鼓足干劲，力争上游。单昭祥说：我们一定要接受这个教训，要做有利条件的主人，决不能再做有利条件的奴隶。
    区委书记们在会上都谈到他们保证小麦高产的具体措施。有四十万人口的通州区初步计划种小麦四十万亩，比去年扩大麦地十四万亩；深翻地至少一尺五寸以上；每亩施底肥二十万斤，现在每亩已积肥十万斤，8月25日前完成全部积肥任务；每亩使用优良籽种至少六十斤；平整好土地，上有渠道，下机井，何时地干保证何时有水浇。山多、地少、水源不足的周口店区，麦田也要占总耕地面积的一半，即由十七万五千亩扩大到二十万亩；深翻一尺七寸到两尺；乡乡队队有化肥厂，每亩施底肥十万斤，每亩密植籽种四十斤以上；平整土地，做到园田化；开山找泉，挖地打井，利用地下水浇地。其他各区也都在会上提出了初步的指标和措施。
    在大会上，各区的书记们特别着重谈到了广泛种试验田的规划。如通州区的区、乡、社、队干部，已初步决定搞一万亩高产试验田。区委直属机关干部已经开始种的五十亩试验田，准备深翻五、六尺，施底肥三十万斤，争取更高额的丰产。
    在会上，郊区各区展开了友谊竞赛，都表示要力争第一。
    到会的区、乡、社、队干部，听了彭真同志报告以后，又看到各区展开竞赛，个个摩拳擦掌，斗志昂扬。有些区在散会以后立即在原地继续开会，研究行动计划。
    在这个农业大跃进的誓师大会结束时，彭真同志要求工业、基本建设、商业、教育、文化和政法等各部门，都要根据农业方面的新形势，鼓足干劲，立即赶上去。
