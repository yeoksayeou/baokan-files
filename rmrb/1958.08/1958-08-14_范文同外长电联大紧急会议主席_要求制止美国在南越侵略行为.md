Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 13th: Phan Van Dong, Foreign Minister of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram on August 12th to the Chairman of the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, suggesting that while the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the situation in the Middle East due to the aggressive actions of the United States and Britain, it should also pay attention to the situation in Southeast Asia caused by the United States' policy of intervention and war preparation, especially the situation in South Vietnam.

The telegram stated that in 1954, the Geneva Conference reached various agreements based on the recognition of the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. However, soon after peace was restored in Indochina, the United States colluded with some countries to form the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc as a tool to realize its enslavement policy and challenging conspiracy, in order to undermine peace and national independence movements in the region.

The United States placed South Vietnam within the "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. For four years, the United States has increasingly intensified its intervention in South Vietnam, undermined the peace of Vietnam, obstructed the unification of Vietnam, and seriously violated the Geneva Agreements.

Phan Van Dong pointed out that the United States not only incited and helped the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine the provisions and principles of the Geneva Agreement on restoring the reunification of Vietnam, but also continuously violated the military provisions of the Geneva Agreement: that is, prohibiting the illegal import of armaments in order to prevent war and ensure the peace of Vietnam.

The telegram described item by item the facts that a large number of American military personnel poured into South Vietnam, manipulating the armed forces and administrative organs of South Vietnam.

The telegram stated that it is obvious that the United States is turning South Vietnam into a base for aggression, undermining the peace and reunification of Vietnam, and undermining the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, thus seriously violating the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter. The United States' intervention in South Vietnam is part of the United States' enslavement and war preparation conspiracy in Southeast Asia and currently in the Middle East. This action threatens the peace and national independence of many countries and has created world tension.

The telegram stated that for the sake of the peace and unity of the Vietnamese people, and in order to contribute to defending the peace and national independence of Southeast Asian countries and other countries in the world, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the United Nations to take measures to force the United States to respect the national self-determination of Vietnam, stop its policy of intervention and challenging in South Vietnam, and completely withdraw American military personnel from this region.

### 范文同外长电联大紧急会议主席　要求制止美国在南越侵略行为

　　范文同外长电联大紧急会议主席
　　要求制止美国在南越侵略行为
    新华社河内13日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部长范文同12日打电报给联合国大会紧急特别会议主席，建议联合国大会紧急特别会议在讨论由于美、英侵略行为所造成的中近东局势问题的时候，能同时注意到美国的干涉和备战政策所造成的东南亚局势，尤其是南越的形势。
    电报说，1954年，日内瓦会议在承认越南、柬埔寨、老挝三国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上达成了各项协议，但是在印度支那刚刚恢复和平以后，美国就拉拢一些国家成立东南亚军事侵略集团，作为实现它的奴役政策和挑战阴谋的工具，以破坏这个区域的和平和民族独立运动。
    美国把南越放在东南亚侵略集团的“保护”范围内。四年以来，美国日益加紧干涉南越，破坏越南的和平，阻挠越南的统一，严重违反了日内瓦协议。
    范文同指出，美国不但唆使和帮助南越当局破坏日内瓦协议政治条款和原则所规定的恢复越南的统一，同时还不断违反日内瓦协议的军事条款：即禁止非法输入军备，以防止战争并保障越南的和平。
    电报逐项叙述了美国大量军事人员涌入南越，操纵南越的武装力量和行政机构等事实。
    电报说，很明显，美国正在把南越变成侵略基地，破坏越南的和平和统一，破坏日内瓦协议的执行，因此严重地违反了联合国宪章有关条款。美国对南越的干涉行动是美国在东南亚和目前在中近东的奴役和备战阴谋中的一部分。这种行动威胁了许多国家的和平和民族独立，造成了世界的紧张局势。
    电报说，为了越南人民的和平和统一，为了对保卫东南亚各国和世界其它各国的和平和民族独立作出贡献，越南民主共和国政府要求联合国采取措施，迫使美国尊重越南的民族自决权，停止它在越南南方的干涉和挑战政策，把美国军事人员从这个地区全部撤出去。
