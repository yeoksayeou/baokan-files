Adding Talent to the Agricultural Front
　　In the past, women were tied to three platforms,
　　The grindstone, the well platform, and the stove platform,
　　Firewood, rice, oil, salt, scallions, ginger, and garlic,
　　Kept them so busy they never raised their heads.
　　Since the dining hall sign went up,
　　Sisters-in-law and older women smile with delight,
　　Liberating women's labor power,
　　Adding talent to the agricultural front.

　　农业战线添人才
　　过去妇女守三台，
　　磨台井台加锅台，
　　柴米油盐葱姜蒜，
　　忙得整天头不抬。
　　自从挂出食堂牌，
　　嫂子大娘笑开怀，
　　解放妇女劳动力，
　　农业战线添人才。
