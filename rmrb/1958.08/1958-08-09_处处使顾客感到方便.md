    Making Customers Feel Convenient Everywhere
    In the center of the first floor of Shanghai's No. 1 Department Store, there is a hexagonal counter. The salespeople here do not sell goods, but instead serve customers all day long.
    When customers first come to this large store with five shopping areas, they often get lost and cannot find the place to buy what they need. If they go to the service counter, a guide will direct them and even accompany them. If customers buy too many things and it is inconvenient to carry them up and down the floors, the service counter can store them on behalf of the customer.
    Purchasing agents from other places and customers traveling to visit relatives can conveniently buy train tickets to all parts of the country at the service counter. If a customer wants to take a car, there is a two-way radio that connects directly to the Shanghai Taxi Company, and a car will be parked at the entrance of the store in a few minutes; if they want to take a pedicab, the service counter can also hire one for them. A pedicab station is specially set up at the entrance of the store, and the fare is calculated according to the distance, without having to haggle.
    The service counter is also like a small post office, with green mailboxes placed on the counter. Customers can mail letters here, or they can buy goods and entrust them to be packed and shipped, and they can also buy the Shanghai newspapers of the day.
    In the display window of the service counter, there are advertisements for various new plays. If a customer wants to see a play after buying something, they can buy tickets for the twelve cinemas and theaters in the city on the same day. They also reserve theater tickets for customers.
    Since the establishment of the service counter a month ago, customers have generally praised its convenience, and the salespeople are praised every day.

    处处使顾客感到方便
    上海第一百货商店一楼商场的中央，有一个六角形的柜台。这里的营业员不出售商品，而是整天为顾客服务。
    初来这个拥有五个商场的大商店，顾客往往会迷失方向，一时找不到购买自己需要东西的地方。到服务处来，就有向导员给他指引，还可带路陪伴。顾客东西买多了，楼上楼下带着不方便，服务处可以代客保管。
    外地的采购员、出门旅行探亲的顾客，可以顺便在服务处买到全国各地的火车票。如果顾客要乘汽车，这里有对讲电话直通上海出租汽车公司，不几分钟汽车就停在商店门口；要乘三轮车，服务处也可代雇。商店门口专设了一个三轮车站，按路程远近计算车资，不用讨价还价。
    服务处又像个小邮局，柜台上放着绿色的信箱，顾客在这里可以寄信，也可以买了东西委托装箱发运，还能够买到当天上海的报纸。
    在服务处的橱窗里，贴着各种新戏的广告。如果顾客买好东西想去看戏，可以在这里买到市区十二家影院、剧场的当天票子。他们同样也为顾客预订戏票。
    服务处设立一个月来，顾客普遍称便，营业员每天都受到表扬。
