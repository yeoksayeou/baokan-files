According to a report in the Gansu Daily, Lanzhou University recently held its first examination after the implementation of work-study programs. All 160 students in the three first-year classes of the Chemistry Department felt that this semester's work-study activities had integrated theory with practice, further consolidating what they had learned from books, and were therefore full of confidence.

The examination began. After lecturer Wang Wei distributed the test papers, he slowly explained for ten minutes, repeatedly declaring smugly:
	“Papers must be handed in on time, no extensions will be granted.”
The students looked at their watches and saw that they only had forty minutes left. The three major questions included nineteen sub-questions, averaging two minutes per question. The time was clearly insufficient. The bell rang, but the students were still writing furiously, and no one handed in their paper.
	“Hand in your papers! Hand in your papers! If you don’t hand them in, they will be discarded!”
Teacher Wang urged loudly, while scanning the classroom. Still, there was no movement. He casually took the papers from the students in the front rows, picked them up, and walked towards the door. The students panicked. Although they had not finished, they rushed to the door to hand in their papers in order to avoid violating examination regulations.

The result of the examination was that 62.5 percent of the papers failed.

After the examination, an evil wind swept through the department, saying that the 62.5 percent failure rate was the result of work-study programs reducing the quality of learning.

Chen Qingtang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Chemistry Department, firmly believed that since the students had improved their political awareness during the work-study activities this semester, the quality of their learning must have also improved. He suspected the examination.

He heard some students say:
	“It’s all about memorization. You can't answer even if you read books all day.”
	“It’s deliberately making things difficult. So many questions in so little time!”
	“Let the teachers take the test and see if they can answer it.”
After he raised this issue at the General Branch Committee, everyone agreed to get to the bottom of it and decided to launch a debate on work-study programs among first- and second-year students to clarify their thinking and stabilize their emotions. Through discussions with students in some classes, Comrade Chen Qingtang fully understood Wang Wei's conspiracy behind this examination. The sentence the students had said suddenly flashed in his mind: "Let the teachers take the test and see if they can answer it." "Yes, let the teachers take the test." Chen Qingtang immediately affirmed this approach and decided to have all the teachers in the Inorganic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group take the test. The General Branch Committee agreed with this suggestion.

This was truly unexpected by those teachers who opposed work-study programs! However, they had always prided themselves on their extensive knowledge, so how could they say "no"? When they opened the test papers, they were like ants on a hot pot. As a result of the examination, no one answered all the questions correctly. Ge Fuxiang, the director of the teaching and research group and a third-grade professor who approved the test paper, took forty minutes for the first test and was unable to hand in the paper. He took the test again and scored only 28 points. The lecturer who set the questions, Wang Wei, was also very embarrassed. He had set the questions himself and had graded dozens of student papers, reviewing the questions dozens of times. His score should have been good, right? But his examination result was also disappointing, with a score of only 45 points, also a failure.

After participating in this examination, the teachers in the teaching and research group also said: "With such a heavy workload, how can it be completed in forty minutes? We would have to double the time if we were to take the test." When they analyzed the problems with this test paper, they pointed out: 1. Wang Wei's questions were all memory-based; 2. Some questions were too demanding for first-year chemistry students, and even the teachers could not remember some of the reaction formulas; 3. Wang Wei did not explain some of the questions clearly in class.

Through this examination, the true colors of Wang Wei, Ge Fuxiang, and other calculators were fully exposed. It turned out that they were trying to use the examination to provoke students' dissatisfaction with work-study programs and further deny the superiority of work-study programs. However, they finally lost, and lost everything. Teachers and students were very angry about the calculators' conspiracy and held several meetings to launch a serious criticism of their bourgeois ideology and behavior.

Wang Wei is a white flag. He served as the deputy director of the teaching and research group. The organization had prepared to transfer teachers to this teaching and research group several times; he first asked if they were Party or League members, and if they were, he refused on the pretext that there were enough people. During the Two-Anti Campaign, teachers and students posted dozens of big-character posters criticizing him and asking him to examine his relationship with rightists Chen Shiwei and Zuo Zongqi, which made him even more dissatisfied. After the implementation of work-study programs, Comrade Chen Qingtang invited Ge Fuxiang and other professors to discuss setting up a factory, but they emphasized the difficulties. Later, the department assigned Ge Fuxiang to trial-produce detergent powder, and Wang Wei led the purification of alkali, but after three or four months, there were still no results.

This struggle greatly encouraged the determination of teachers and students in the Chemistry Department to move towards the direction of combining education and labor production. Students who could not even prepare reagents without teachers in the past have now manufactured more than ten kinds of chemical reagents that have reached international standards; students who only focused on studying books in the past are now extracting several kinds of rare metals with young teaching assistants. Ge Fuxiang studied thorium nitrate for four years without success, but students and young teachers made it after twelve hours of hard work.

Facts have proven that once education is combined with labor, the quality of teaching will be greatly improved. Now, the teachers and students of the department are launching a wave of large-scale factories. The three backbone factories of electrolysis, sulfuric acid, and coal-to-oil are under active preparation. The piles of products from the Chemistry Department's factories and the ever-increasing "surpass Britain" products will boast to the calculators: Don't dream of your victory. (Attached picture)

    勤工俭学算账派输得精光
    兰大少数教师想制造借口抗拒教育结合劳动的方针
    大出难题限制时间企图难倒学生结果是考倒了自己
    据甘肃日报消息　不久以前，兰州大学开始了勤工俭学后的第一次考试。化学系一年级三个班一百六十个学生，都觉得这学期在勤工俭学活动中，使理论结合了实际，更加巩固了从书本上学到的东西，因而个个充满了信心。
    考试开始了，讲师王慰发下试卷以后，他慢吞吞地解释了十分钟，还一再神气十足地声明：
    “到时候马上要交卷，决不延长时间。”
    同学们一看手表，只有四十分钟了，三大试题中包括了十九个小题，平均每二分钟一个题，时间显然是不够用的。下课铃响了，学生们还在簌簌地写，没有一个交卷的。
      “交卷！交卷！不交就不要了！” 
    王老师一面高声催促着，一面用眼扫了一下课堂，仍然没有什么动静。他顺手抽去了前面几位学生的卷子，挟起来径向门口走去。学生们慌了，卷子虽然都没作完，但是为了不违反考试纪律，都纷纷赶到门口，匆匆把卷子交了。
    考试的结果，百分之六十二点五的卷子不及格。
    考试以后，在这个系里刮起一股妖风，说这次百分之六十二点五的卷子不及格，正是勤工俭学降低学习质量的结果。
    化学系党总支书记陈庆堂坚信这学期学生们在勤工俭学活动中既然提高了政治觉悟，学习质量也必然会提高的。他就怀疑这次考试。
    他听到一些学生这样议论：
      “都是考死记的。整天念书本也答不上。”
      “故意整人嘛，这么点时间，考这么多题目！”
    “让先生考考看，他们也不一定能答得出。”
    他把这个问题提到总支委员会以后，大家都同意把这个问题搞个水落石出，并决定在一、二年级学生中展开勤工俭学的辩论，以明确思想、稳定情绪。通过和一些班级学生的座谈，陈庆堂同志完全明白了王慰在这次考试后面的阴谋诡计。他的脑子里忽然闪出学生们说过的一句话：“让先生考考看，他们也不一定能答得出。”“对，让教员考。”陈庆堂立即肯定了这个做法，决定让无机化学教研组全体教员都来考试一下这张试题。总支委员会同意了这个意见。
    这真是出乎这些反对勤工俭学的教师们意料之外！但是，他们一向自恃学识渊博，又怎能说出半个“不”字呢？当他们摊开试卷后，就好像蚂蚁上了热锅似的。考试的结果，没有一人完全答对的。批准这张试题的教研组主任、三级教授戈福祥，第一次考了四十分钟，硬是交不了卷，又考了一次，只得了二十八分。出题的讲师王慰也很狼狈，题目是他自己出的，而且批改了学生几十份卷子，题目也反复温习了几十遍，成绩该不错吧？可是他的考试结果也很不争气，成绩只有四十五分，也是不及格。
    参加这场考试以后，教研组的教师也说：“这样重的分量，四十分钟怎能考得完，考我们也得增加一倍时间。”他们分析这个试题上存在的问题时，指出：一、王慰的题目全部是记忆题；二、有些题对化学系一年级学生要求过高，有的反应式连教师也记不清；三、有些题目，王慰在课堂上根本没讲清楚。
    通过这次考试，王慰、戈福祥等算账派的面目完全暴露出来了。原来他们企图借考试挑起学生对勤工俭学的不满，并进而否定勤工俭学的优越性。但是，他们终于输了，而且输得精光。师生对算账派的阴谋非常愤慨，开了好几次会议，对他们的资产阶级思想和行为展开了严肃的批判。
    王慰是一面白旗。他担任教研组副主任，组织上几次准备给这个教研组调教员；他首先问是否党团员，是党团员就借口人手已够而拒绝。双反运动中，师生给他贴了几十张大字报，要他好好检查和右派分子陈时伟、左宗杞的关系，他更心怀不满。勤工俭学开展以后，陈庆堂同志邀请戈福祥等几位教授商量搞工业，他们强调这也困难那也困难。后来，系里分配戈福祥试制去污粉，王慰领导土碱提纯，可是三四个月过去了，仍没有什么结果。
    这一场斗争大大鼓舞了化学系师生向教育和劳动生产相结合的方向迈进的决心。过去连配试剂也离不开教师的学生，现在已经自己制造出十几种达到国际水平的化学试剂；过去只注意啃书本的学生，现在和青年助教在一起提炼出了好几种稀有金属。戈福祥对硝酸钍研究了四年没有成效，学生和青年教师苦战十二小时便制成了。
    事实证明，教育一经和劳动结合，教学质量就会大大地提高。现在该系师生正掀起了大办工厂的热潮，电解、硫酸、煤炼油等三个骨干厂在积极筹建中。化学系工厂成堆成批的产品和与日俱增的“超英”产品，都将向算账派夸耀：不要梦想你们的胜利。（附图片）
　　放下你的白旗吧，我们不会停车的。英韬
