Being both protectors and builders, the People's Liberation Army vigorously supports national construction.

(Reported by our newspaper) Under the principle of not hindering combat readiness and training, all units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are seizing every minute and second and actively participating in various socialist construction endeavors with soaring revolutionary vigor and an invincible spirit.

Statistics up to mid-July show that in half a year, the troops have helped the people fight drought, rush planting, harvest crops, hoe fields, reclaim wasteland, and build farmland water conservancy projects, providing a total of 32 million labor days, exceeding the annual plan by 2 million labor days. Among them, the Nanjing troops exceeded the annual plan by 120%, the Shenyang troops exceeded the annual plan by 119%, the Beijing troops exceeded the annual plan by 117%, and the units directly under the headquarters exceeded the annual plan by 108%. In half a year, more than 8,700 various types of industrial and agricultural capital construction projects were completed, with a total earth and stone volume of 50 million cubic meters. If these earth and stone were built into a one-cubic-meter levee, it could circle the earth one and a quarter times. In half a year, a total of 100 million trees were planted, with a survival rate of over 80%. This would allow a tree to be planted every meter along both sides of the levee circling the earth one and a quarter times. During this period, the troops also transported more than 10 billion catties of fertilizer to agricultural cooperatives in various places, which, at 10,000 catties per mu, could fertilize more than 1 million mu of land. If transported by trucks with a payload of 2.5 tons, it would require 2 million trips. At every work site, the PLA officers and soldiers were full of energy, and creations and inventions emerged endlessly. According to statistics from one division at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site alone, more than 800 rationalization proposals and tool reforms were made in one and a half months.

In order to accelerate the local industrial construction of the motherland, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is launching a vigorous upsurge in support of industrial construction. Many troops have been clearing their inventory and allocating temporarily unused machines, lathes, and vehicles to local use. Statistics up to mid-July show that 1,600 vehicles, 93 tractors, and other types of machinery have been allocated. Factories jointly run or self-operated by troops and localities are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. Many troop repair shops and stations are actively tapping their potential under the premise of ensuring military production tasks, and establishing various types of steel plants and machine manufacturing plants in accordance with the principle of combining large, medium, and small, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. For example, more than 900 officers and soldiers of Unit 0938 built a 60-ton-per-day iron smelting plant from scratch after three days and nights of hard work, and produced the first furnace of iron on "July 1st." The Lanzhou Military Region Automobile Repair Factory, after smelting high-speed tool steel and medium carbon steel in June, added steelmaking and iron workshops, and plans to produce 50 to 60 tons of steel ingots this year. The "August 1st" Iron and Steel Joint Factory, planned and built by the Hubei Military Region, plans to produce iron in the short term, and reach an annual output of 1 to 1.2 million tons of iron and steel by 1962. According to incomplete statistics, among the automobile repair and assembly plants of the entire army, one factory has manufactured small locomotives, two factories can manufacture automobiles by themselves, three factories can manufacture tractors by themselves, and one factory can manufacture trolleybuses. The naval repair factories have accepted large orders from ten provinces and cities, including metallurgical equipment for steel plants, machine manufacturing equipment, and other fishing boats and motors. As for the small factories run by the troops, they are countless, truly blooming everywhere.

In addition, the People's Navy also participated in the struggle to protect fishing and escort ships, dispatching a total of 195 ship sorties, sailing for nearly a thousand hours; the Air Force participated in flood prevention and disaster relief; the railway soldiers increased the road construction indicators again and again, and the San Daokan Bridge of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway was completed four and a half months ahead of schedule. While completing these tremendous achievements, the troops also used their spare time to engage in production such as pig raising and vegetable growing. Land reclamation alone reached more than 120,000 mu. In addition to miscellaneous grains, it is estimated that more than 400 million catties of vegetables can be harvested. Many troops have not only been able to achieve self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, improve the troops' living standards, and reduce the amount of supplies to the local areas, but also supply some of the needs of the local markets.

Since the first half of this year, the broad masses of officers and soldiers have successfully completed the tasks of combat readiness and training. At present, in addition to continuing to vigorously support the socialist construction of the motherland and stepping up training, the People's Liberation Army is on high alert, paying close attention to the development of the Middle East situation. If the American and British imperialists dare to violate the peace-loving wishes of the people of the world and continue to play with war in the Middle East and expand the war of aggression, the serious consequences will only be to repeat the old path of the war criminals Hitler and Mussolini.

    既是保卫者又是建设者
    解放军大力支援祖国建设
    本报讯　中国人民解放军各部队在不妨碍战备训练的原则下，抢时间，挤时间，以冲天的革命干劲，无往不胜的气概，积极的参加社会主义各项建设事业。
    截至7月中旬统计，半年内，部队帮助人民群众抗旱、抢种、收割、锄地开荒及兴修农田水利等，共支援了三千二百万个劳动日，超过全年计划二百万个劳动日。其中，南京部队超过全年计划120％，沈阳部队超过全年计划119％，北京部队超过全年计划117％，总部直属机关部队超过全年计划108％。半年内，共完成各种类型的工、农业基本建设工程八千七百多项，土石方量达五千万立方公尺，如将这些土石方筑成一道一立方公尺的长堤可绕地球一周又四分之一。半年内，共植树一亿株，成活率达80％以上，正好在绕地球一周又四分之一的长堤两侧，每公尺植树一株。在这个时间内，部队还为各地农业合作社运送肥料一百多亿斤，以每亩施肥万斤计，可供一百多万亩土地用肥，如用载重两吨半的汽车运载，需要两百万车次。在每一个劳动现场上，解放军官兵钻劲十足，创造发明层出不穷。仅据在十三陵水库工地上的一个师的统计，一个半月内，合理化建议和工具改革即达八百多件。
    为了加速祖国的地方工业建设，中国人民解放军各部队正掀起一个蓬勃的支援工业建设高潮。许多部队都进行了库存物资的清理，把暂时不用的机器、车床及车辆等，分别调拨给地方使用。截至7月中旬统计，已拨出汽车一千六百辆，拖拉机九十三台，还有其它各种机具。部队和地方合办或自办的工厂，犹如雨后春笋。许多部队的修理厂、站，在保证军需生产任务下，积极挖掘潜力，本着大、中、小结合，土洋结合的方针，兴办了各种类型的钢铁厂和机器制造厂。如0938部队九百多名官兵，经三昼夜奋战，白手起家建立了一座日产六十吨的炼铁厂，已于“七一”出了第一炉铁。兰州部队汽车修理厂，于6月份炼了高速工具钢、中碳钢以后，又增设了炼钢、铁车间，计划今年生产五十到六十吨钢锭。湖北军区筹建的“八一”钢铁联合厂，计划短期内出铁，到1962年达到年产钢铁一百至一百二十万吨。又据不完全统计，全军汽车修配厂中，已有一个厂制成小火车头，两个厂能自制汽车，三个厂能自制拖拉机，一个厂能制成无轨电车。海军各修理厂已接受十个省、市的大批订货，其中包括有钢铁厂的冶金设备，机器制造设备和其他渔轮、电机等。至于部队开办的小型工厂则数不胜数，真是遍地开花。
    此外，人民海军还参加了护渔、护航斗争，共出动航艇一百九十五艘次，航行近千小时；空军参加了防汛救灾；铁道兵部队筑路指标一再加番，包兰路三道坎大桥提前四个半月完工。各部队在完成上述这些巨大成绩的同时，还利用课余时间进行养猪、种菜等生产。仅开荒一项，即达十二万多亩，除杂粮外，估计可收蔬菜四亿多斤，不少部队不仅已能作到肉类、蔬菜自给，改善了部队生活，减少地方上的供应量，而且还供应了地方一部分市场上的需要。
    今年上半年以来，广大官兵胜利地完成了战备和训练任务。目前，除了继续大力支援祖国的社会主义建设、加紧训练以外，人民解放军正严阵以待，注视着中东局势的发展，如果美英帝国主义者敢于触犯世界人民爱好和平的愿望，继续在中东玩弄战火，扩大侵略战争，其严重后果就只有重踏希特勒和墨索里尼战争罪魁的老路。
