More, faster, better, and more economical construction of socialism is a general line that applies to every task. However, there is a group of people singing a tune that "the general line does not apply to art work," and "works created with more, faster, better, and more economical methods are not works of art." The fact that teachers and students of the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts produced more than 90,000 paintings in two months of going to the countryside has completely shattered these arguments. They not only created a huge number of works in a short period of time, but also the quality was very high, truly achieving the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. This is a revolutionary event of great significance in China's art world.

Going deep among the worker and peasant masses, throwing oneself into the vigorous struggle, eating, living, laboring, breathing, sharing weal and woe with the worker and peasant masses, changing people's thoughts and feelings, and then using artistic means to vividly, truthfully and vividly reflect the face of our era, can good things be painted.

The teachers and students of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts did this, and immediately achieved a double harvest of thought and creation. Because in the course of labor, they gradually changed their thoughts and feelings, and obtained inexhaustible creative themes from the vivid practice of the masses.

The right-wing elements in the art world once openly clamored against art serving politics. They said that "artworks with political content must be formulaic and conceptual," emphasizing the pursuit of "inspiration," "mood," and "personal style." This time, the teachers and students of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts went deep among the worker and peasant masses, had the same inspiration and mood as the workers and peasants, and created a large number of works reflecting the socialist worker and peasant emotions. Most of the new people, new things, and new faces they painted were of high political quality, and the artistic techniques also reached a considerably high level. Their works are deeply loved by the broad masses.

Facts have proved that art only has vitality if it truly reflects the struggle life of the masses.

　　美术工作的多快好省
    多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，适用于每一项工作。但是却有那么一批人唱着这样一种论调：“总路线不适用于美术工作”、“多快好省创作出来的作品不是艺术品”。从浙江美术学院师生下乡两个月，产生了九万多幅画来看，已彻底地粉碎了这些论调。他们不仅在短期内创作了庞大数量的作品，而且质量也很高，真正达到了多快好省的要求。这是我国美术界一个有革命意义的盛举。
    深入工农群众，投身到轰轰烈烈的斗争中去，和工农群众同吃同住同劳动同呼吸同甘苦，改变人们的思想感情，再用艺术手段，鲜明真实生动地反映出我们这个时代的面貌，才能画出好的东西来。
    浙江美术学院师生这样作，就立即获得思想、创作双丰收。因为他们在劳动中逐渐改变了自己的思想感情，并从群众的生动实践中获得了取之不尽的创作题材。
    美术界的右派分子们曾经公开叫嚣，反对艺术为政治服务。他们说“有政治内容的艺术品必然公式化、概念化”，强调追求“灵感”、“情调”、“个人风格”。这次浙江美术学院师生深入工农群众，有了和工农一致的灵感和情调，创作了大量反映社会主义工农情绪的作品，他们所画的新人新事、新面貌，大部分政治质量都很高，艺术技巧也达到了相当高的水平。他们的作品深受广大群众的喜爱。
    事实证明，艺术只有真正反映了群众的斗争生活才有生命力。
