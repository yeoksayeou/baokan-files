Xinhua News Agency, August 14th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session convened in New York on the 13th, at 10:45 AM New York time (10:45 PM Beijing time).

The President of the Twelfth Session of the UN General Assembly, Munro (New Zealand), delivered the opening address.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, and the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, Fawzi, spoke at the meeting successively.

In his speech, Gromyko made it very clear that attempts to portray the US and British intervention in the Near East, purportedly based on the requests of the then-President of Lebanon and the King of Jordan and claimed to be in accordance with the UN Charter, as "protecting the independence of Lebanon and Jordan" and shielding them from some kind of conspiracy by the United Arab Republic, were completely untenable.

Gromyko said that no matter how painstakingly the national leaders of the US and Britain try to confuse the public and obscure the true reasons for their armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, they can never conceal the shameful fact of the unwarranted armed intervention by the US and Britain against the Arab people.

Gromyko said that the US and British armed invasion of Lebanon and Jordan is a typical example of the behavior of colonialists, whose primary motive has always been to extract profits by exploiting the enslaved people of dependent countries. Gromyko said that in 1956-1957, US oil monopolies extracted $2.5 billion in profits from Near East countries. Oil, oil, and more oil – this is the root of the US and British monopoly capital's covetousness for the Arab East, and the source of their continuous military adventures in this region.

Gromyko pointed out that although the resolute resistance of the Arab people and the firm stance of other peace-loving countries have thwarted the aggressors' conspiracy against the Arab countries at this stage, this by no means signifies that the danger of war in the Near East has passed.

Gromyko exposed the slander spread by the aggressors in order to justify their conspiracy against the people of the Arab East, the so-called "indirect aggression."

Gromyko pointed out that the opinions elaborated by the US President in his speech at this meeting regarding the issue of economic assistance to countries in the Middle and Near East need appropriate study, but the main issue should be resolved first – the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Gromyko emphasized that it is completely unacceptable to use the topic of economic assistance to divert the UN General Assembly's attention from resolving this main issue. Therefore, the Soviet Union most firmly maintains that the issue of the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan should be resolved without delay as a matter of priority.

The Soviet Foreign Minister finally mentioned that the Soviet Union has already put forward a proposal for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government hopes that the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session will successfully complete the task it faces in restoring peace in the Middle and Near East. The Soviet Union, like other peace-loving countries, will continue to make every necessary effort to steadfastly defend and protect the cause of peace. This determination was also clearly expressed in the recently published communiqué on the Soviet-Chinese talks between Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation is following this policy precisely in this meeting of the General Assembly. He said that this meeting can well serve the cause of peace if every participant in the meeting can have a high sense of responsibility for the outcome of the meeting.

After the representative of Jordan made a brief speech, the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, Fawzi, spoke.

Fawzi said that the government of the United Arab Republic had long stated its attitude toward the actions of the US and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan. He emphasized that the task facing the UN General Assembly is to immediately withdraw US and British troops from these countries. We eagerly await a statement from the US regarding when it intends to withdraw its troops.

Fawzi said that the issue of withdrawal dates is of great significance. He said, "Our country is a country where British troops were stationed in 1882. Since that time, the British government has often made solemn guarantees of so-called immediate withdrawals," "but it took the United Kingdom seventy-three years to fulfill this guarantee, to implement this immediate withdrawal." He expressed that he was "deeply disturbed" that the US had not stated when it would withdraw its troops.

Fawzi said that it is difficult to find words to express the anger of the people of the United Arab Republic towards Britain's actions in Jordan. He emphasized that as long as the British have not withdrawn from Jordan, the United Arab Republic considers itself to be in danger. Fawzi said: The presence of British troops in Jordan not only threatens us, but also threatens the whole world.

Fawzi supported the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation to the meeting for consideration, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He said that the Soviet proposal is fully worthy of serious consideration. He also expressed dissatisfaction with Eisenhower's speech, saying, "Today, someone is brandishing a fist in front of many of us," and the representatives have not been able to "consider and assess the actual ominousness of these words."

At the beginning of the meeting, US President Eisenhower delivered a speech.

Because the US has committed the crime of armed invasion of Lebanon and is in the position of defendant at the UN General Assembly, the US President personally came forward this time to try his best to defend the actions of the US. But he still expressed that the US is unwilling to immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

Eisenhower tried hard to portray the US armed forces' invasion of a small country's territory as "helping a small country maintain its independence." He said that the "legitimate" government of Lebanon "felt threatened by a civil war incited from outside and issued a desperate appeal to the US for immediate assistance. We responded to this appeal." He in turn blamed the forces of peace for condemning and stopping the US-British aggression as "creating war hysteria," as "shouting 'fire' in a crowded hall," and as rendering "invalid the provision in the UN Charter that recognizes the inherent right of collective self-defense."

Eisenhower said that a principle "guiding the attitude of the US" is: "Aggression, whether direct or indirect, must be stopped," "This principle was applied once again in responding to the urgent appeals of the governments of Lebanon and Jordan." He also said that in incidents such as Iran, Greece and Turkey, Korea, and the Taiwan Strait, the US attitude was based on the above principle. In reality, ironclad facts prove that Eisenhower's remarks only show that the US has consistently interfered in the internal affairs of other countries.

Eisenhower also indicated that the US will continue to send troops to the territory of other countries in the future under the pretext of "responding" to "legitimate appeals" from other countries, saying: "If I did not say to you that the US, in the spirit of the UN Charter, reserves the right to respond to the legitimate appeals of any country, especially small countries, I would not be candid."

In his speech, Eisenhower indicated that the US is unwilling to immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon. He did not even mention when the US will withdraw its troops. He said, "As long as the legally constituted government of Lebanon requests it, or as long as through the actions of the United Nations or other parties, Lebanon is no longer subjected to the original danger, the US troops will be completely withdrawn."

Eisenhower asked the General Assembly to consider "four courses of action": Lebanon, Jordan, "subversive propaganda," and a "standing UN force." He called for the UN to establish a "standing UN peace force" in order to serve the interests of imperialist countries and to invade and interfere in the internal affairs of small countries everywhere.

Eisenhower used half of his speech to talk at length about establishing regional Arab development agencies to provide economic assistance to countries in the Middle and Near East, attempting to use this issue to divert the General Assembly's attention from the most pressing issue of demanding the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He suggested that the UN Secretary-General immediately consult with Arab countries on the establishment of this agency and announced that the US is prepared to support this agency. While talking at length about the economic development of the Arab East, Eisenhower tried to portray himself as a friend of the peoples of the Arab countries, and said that "the people of the Arab countries of the Near East clearly have the right to determine and express their own destiny." But the peoples of the Arab countries are well aware that US troops are still occupying their territory.

Eisenhower put forward the US's so-called "Near East Peace Plan," which includes the following points:

"(1) UN concern for Lebanon.
 (2) UN measures to maintain peace in Jordan.
 (3) Cessation of inciting internal strife from the outside.
 (4) A UN peace force.
 (5) A regional economic development plan aimed at helping and accelerating the improvement of the living standards of the people of these Arab countries.
 (6) Taking steps to prevent the spiral of a new arms race in this region."

Eisenhower left the General Assembly hall after his speech.

The UN General Assembly meeting on the 13th ended at this point. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on the 14th.

　　联大紧急特别会议讨论中东局势
　　苏联阿联要美英立刻撤军
　　艾森豪威尔竭力为侵略黎巴嫩的罪行诡辩
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会紧急特别会议13日纽约时间十时四十五分（北京时间二十二时四十五分）在纽约开会。
    联合国大会第十二届会议主席孟罗（新西兰）致开会词。
    苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯，阿拉伯联合共和国外交部长法齐等相继在会上发了言。
    葛罗米柯在发言中十分清楚地说明，企图把根据黎巴嫩当时的总统和约旦国王的请求而进行的、所谓符合联合国宪章的美英两国对近东的干涉说成是“保护黎巴嫩和约旦的独立”和使它们免于遭受阿拉伯联合共和国的某种阴谋，这种说法是完全站不住脚的。
    葛罗米柯说，不管美英两国的国家领导人怎样处心积虑地企图混淆视听来使公众不明白这两个国家武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的真正原因，他们决不能掩盖美英两国无端武装干涉阿拉伯人民的可耻事实。
    葛罗米柯说，美英武装侵入黎巴嫩和约旦是殖民主义者的行为的典型事例，他们的主要动机一向就是企图用剥削附属国的被奴役的人民的方法来榨取利润。葛罗米柯说，1956—1957年，美国的石油垄断资本从近东国家榨取了二十五亿美元的利润。石油，石油，还是石油——这就是使美英垄断资本垂涎阿拉伯东方的根源，使他们不断对这一地区进行军事冒险的根源。
    葛罗米柯指出，虽然阿拉伯人民的坚决反击和其他爱好和平国家的坚定态度使侵略者对阿拉伯国家的阴谋在现阶段遭到挫败，但是这还决不意味着在近东发生战火的危险已经过去了。
    葛罗米柯揭露了侵略者为了替他们反对阿拉伯东方人民的阴谋进行辩解而散播的所谓“间接侵略”的谰言。
    葛罗米柯指出，美国总统在这次会议上发表的演说中就关于给中近东国家经济援助的问题所阐述的那些意见需要适当研究，可是首先应当解决主要的问题——立刻从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出外国军队的问题。葛罗米柯强调指出，要想利用经济援助的话题来转移联合国大会对解决这个主要问题的注意，是完全不能允许的。因此，苏联最坚决地主张：美国军队和英国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题应当毫不拖延地首先解决。
    苏联外交部长最后提到，苏联已经提出了一个关于美国军队立刻撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队立刻撤出约旦的提案。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府希望联合国大会紧急特别会议很好地完成它所面临的、恢复中近东和平的任务。苏联像其他爱好和平的国家一样，今后仍将尽一切必要的努力，始终不渝地捍卫和保护和平事业。在不久以前发表的、关于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和中华人民共和国主席毛泽东的苏中会谈公报中，也明确地表示了这个决心。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团在这次大会会议上正是遵循着这个方针。他说，这次会议能够很好地为和平事业服务，如果每一个会议参加者都能够对会议结果怀着高度责任感的话。
    在约旦代表作了简短发言后，阿拉伯联合共和国外交部长法齐发言。
    法齐说，阿拉伯联合共和国政府早就陈述了它对美英两国在黎巴嫩和约旦的行动的态度。他强调指出，联合国大会面临的任务是立刻使美国军队和英国军队撤出这些国家。我们迫不及待地期望听到美国打算在什么时候撤军的声明。
    法齐说，撤军日期问题有着重要意义。他说，“我们的国家是英国军队在1882年曾经驻扎的一个国家。从那个时候起，英国政府常常提出所谓马上就要撤退的庄严保证”，“但是，联合王国花了七十三年的时间才履行这种保证，实行这种马上撤退。”他表示，他对美国没有说明什么时候撤退军队“深感不安”。
    法齐说，很难找到言词来表达阿拉伯联合共和国人民对英国在约旦的行为的愤怒。他强调指出，只要英国人没有撤出约旦，阿拉伯联合共和国就认为自己是处在危险中。法齐说：英国军队留在约旦不仅威胁着我们，同时也威胁着全世界。
    法齐支持苏联代表团提交会议审议的、要求美国和英国军队毫不拖延地撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案。他说，苏联的提案完全值得认真地考虑。他还对艾森豪威尔的演说表示不满，他说，“今天有人在我们面前向许多人幌动拳头”，代表们还没有能够“考虑和估计这些话的实际的恶兆”。
    会议开始时，美国总统艾森豪威尔发表了演说。
    由于美国犯下了武装侵略黎巴嫩的罪行而在联合国大会上处于被告地位，美国总统这一次亲自出马竭力为美国的行动辩护。但是他仍然表示美国不愿立即从黎巴嫩撤出它的军队。
    艾森豪威尔努力想把美国武装部队侵入一个小国领土说成是“帮助小国维护独立”。他说，黎巴嫩“合法的”政府“由于感到自己受到了由外部煽动起来的内战的威胁，向美国发出了绝望的呼吁，要求立即给予援助。我们响应了这个呼吁。”他反过来责备和平力量谴责和制止美英侵略是“制造战争歇斯底里”，是“在人群拥挤的会场上叫喊‘失火’”，是使联合国宪章中“承认集体自卫的固有权利的规定归于无效”。
    艾森豪威尔说，“指导着美国的态度”的一项原则是：“侵略，不论直接的或间接的侵略，都必须加以制止”，“在响应黎巴嫩和约旦的政府的紧急呼吁时就是再一次应用了这项原则”。他还说，在伊朗、希腊和土耳其、朝鲜、台湾海峡等事件中，美国的态度都以上述原则为依据的。实际上，铁一般的事实证明了，艾森豪威尔这段话只是说美国一贯干涉别国内政。
    艾森豪威尔还表明，美国今后将继续在“响应”别国“合法呼吁”的借口下派军队到别国领土上去，他说：“如果我不对诸位说，美国在联合国宪章精神内保留了响应任何国家特别是小国的合法呼吁的权利，那我就是不坦率了。”
    艾森豪威尔在演说中表明，美国不愿立即从黎巴嫩撤出它的军队。他甚至不谈美国将在何时撤出军队。他说，“只要合法组成的黎巴嫩政府提出要求，或者是只要通过联合国或者其他方面的行动，黎巴嫩不再遭受原来的危险，美国军队就将全部撤退”。
    艾森豪威尔要求大会考虑“四个行动方面”：黎巴嫩、约旦、“颠复宣传”和“联合国常备军队”。他要求联合国建立一支“常备联合国和平部队”，以便为帝国主义国家利益服务，到处去侵略和干涉小国内政。
    艾森豪威尔用他的演说的一半来大谈设立区域性的阿拉伯发展机构以对中近东国家进行经济援助的问题，他企图利用这个问题来转移大会对于要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦这个最迫切的问题的注意。他建议联合国秘书长立即就建立这个机构的问题同阿拉伯国家进行磋商，并且宣布美国准备支持这一机构。艾森豪威尔在大谈阿拉伯东方的经济发展问题的时候，努力想装扮成是阿拉伯各国人民的朋友，并且说什么“近东各阿拉伯国家的人民显然拥有决定和表现自己命运的权利”。但是阿拉伯各国人民却都清楚，美国的军队还侵占着他们的国土。
    艾森豪威尔提出了美国的所谓“近东和平计划”，其中包括如下各点：
    “（一）联合国对黎巴嫩的关心。
      （二）联合国维护约旦的和平的措施。
      （三）停止从外部煽动内争。
      （四）一支联合国和平部队。
      （五）一个目的在于帮助和加速改善这些阿拉伯国家的人民的生活水平的区域性经济发展计划。
      （六）采取步骤防止在这个地区发生新的武装竞赛的螺旋。”
    艾森豪威尔在演说以后离开了大会会场。
    联合国大会13日会议至此结束。下次会议定在14日举行。
