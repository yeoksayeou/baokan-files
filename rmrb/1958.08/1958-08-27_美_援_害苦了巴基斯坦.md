　　U.S. "Aid" Hurts Pakistan
    Pakistan began receiving U.S. "Point Four Program" aid in 1950. After the signing of the "U.S.-Pakistan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" in 1954, U.S. "aid" to Pakistan increased, but the negative consequences also grew.

    Accompanying U.S. "aid" was a startling annual increase in Pakistan's military expenditure. In the 1957-1958 fiscal year, defense spending accounted for almost 60% of the total budget. In the 1958-1959 fiscal year, defense spending accounted for more than one billion rupees out of a budget of 1,435.54 million rupees. Huge military spending caused huge fiscal deficits, leading to inflation and rising prices, and deepening Pakistan's economic crisis.

    Even the so-called economic "aid" was mostly designated for importing surplus U.S. agricultural products, consumer goods, and supporting U.S. "experts." For example, in the 1956-1957 fiscal year, U.S. "aid" to Pakistan included $75 million in "surplus agricultural product aid" and $64 million in "commodity aid," which together accounted for about 78% of the total U.S. "aid" for the year. However, according to a report in Pakistan's "Dawn" newspaper, waste products accounted for about 30% of the goods the U.S. "aided" Pakistan with. To obtain such "aid products," Pakistan had to purchase them at prices nearly 40% higher than world prices. In addition, high freight charges had to be paid to U.S. companies.

    Not only that, but what U.S. "aid" particularly sought to exchange was Pakistan's sovereignty and resources. According to the agreement signed between the U.S. and Pakistan, Pakistan had to provide the U.S. with raw materials and processed materials, and had to make "full contributions" of manpower, resources, and equipment to the "defense forces of the free world." The U.S. also had the right to strictly limit Pakistan's foreign trade. Due to economic dependence on the U.S., Pakistan became a target for the U.S. to shift its economic crisis. 55% of Pakistan's wool is exported to the U.S. and 27% to the U.K. Since the beginning of this year, under the influence of the U.S. economic crisis, wool prices have fallen by 50% and cotton prices by 10%-20%, causing huge losses to the Pakistani economy.

    The U.S. also gave Pakistan some so-called "engineering aid," but not only were the machines and equipment provided often unsuitable for use in Pakistan, but the U.S. also announced the cancellation of such "aid" at any time, causing Pakistan to suffer greatly. For example, the U.S. once withdrew aid for the construction of the highway from Karachi to Quetta and withdrew aid for a power transmission line project, which almost paralyzed the Multan power station at the time.

    Under the guise of "supervising" the use of U.S. "aid," the U.S. also sent a large number of "experts," "advisers," or "technicians" who enjoyed diplomatic privileges, infiltrating Pakistan's defense, internal affairs, transportation, industry and commerce, and other government departments, and rudely interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs.

### 美“援”害苦了巴基斯坦

　　美“援”害苦了巴基斯坦
    巴基斯坦在1950年就开始接受美国的“第四点计划”援助。1954年“美巴共同防御援助协定”签订后，美国给巴基斯坦的“援款”增多，但带来的恶果也越大。
    伴随美“援”而来的，是巴基斯坦的军费开支惊人地逐年激增。1957—1958年度国防费用几乎占总预算的60％。1958—1959年度十四亿三千五百四十万卢比预算中，国防费用更占到十亿卢比以上。庞大的军费开支造成了巨额的财政赤字，引起通货膨胀和物价上涨，加深了巴基斯坦的经济危机。
    即使是所谓经济“援助”，也大部分是被指定用于进口美国剩余农产品、消费品和供养美国“专家”。如1956—1957年度美国给巴基斯坦的“援助”中，“剩余农产品援助”达七千五百万美元，“商品援助”达六千四百万美元，两项共占全年美“援”的78％左右。但据巴基斯坦“黎明报”的报道，在美国“援助”巴基斯坦的商品中，废品达到了大约30％。为了取得这样的“援助品”，巴基斯坦还得要以高于世界价格将近40％的价钱购买。此外，还要付给美国公司以高额的运费。
    不仅这样，美“援”特别要换取的是巴基斯坦的主权和资源。根据美巴签订的协定，巴基斯坦要对美国提供原料和加工物资，并要对“自由世界防御力量”作出人力、资源、设备的“充分贡献”。美国还有权对巴基斯坦的对外贸易进行严格限制。由于对美国的经济依赖，巴基斯坦成了美国经济危机的转嫁对象。巴基斯坦55％的羊毛输往美国，27％输往英国，自今年初以来，在美国的经济危机影响下，羊毛价格下降了50％，棉花下降了10％—20％，使巴基斯坦经济遭受了巨大损失。
    美国也给巴基斯坦一些所谓“工程援助”，但不仅提供的机器和设备常常不适合于在巴基斯坦使用，而且美国动不动就宣布撤销这类“援助”，使巴基斯坦吃尽苦头。如美国曾撤回由卡拉奇到基达的公路建设工程和撤回一项输电线路工程的援助，使穆尔坦发电站当时差不多陷于瘫痪状态。
    美国还在“监督”使用美“援”的名义下，派遣了大批享有外交特权的“专家”、“顾问”或“技术人员”，渗入巴基斯坦的国防、内政、交通、工商业等政府部门，粗暴干涉巴基斯坦的内政。　（雪）
