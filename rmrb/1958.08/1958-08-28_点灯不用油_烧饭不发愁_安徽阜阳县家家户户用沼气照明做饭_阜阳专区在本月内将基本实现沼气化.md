　　Lighting without Oil, Cooking without Worry
    Anhui Fuyang County Families Use Biogas for Lighting and Cooking
    Fuyang Prefecture to Basically Achieve Biogasification This Month
    (Our Dispatch) Fuyang County has basically achieved biogasification. All 331 agricultural cooperatives in the county are widely using biogas for cooking, making tea, and lighting (the number of people using biogas accounts for 80% of the county's total population), and some cooperatives are using biogas for power generation.
    Fuyang County began experimenting with biogas in mid-March of this year. To date, the county has built 70,694 biogas digesters and biogas jars, and utilized more than 20,000 natural biogas ditches and ponds.
    Fuyang County was able to basically achieve biogasification in a short period of time primarily because the County Party Committee strengthened political and ideological leadership, fully mobilized the masses, and universally adopted indigenous methods.
    First, they relied on the masses to expand the source of biogas. At that time, more than 300 fermentation ponds established in various places used the method of sealed fermentation to cultivate biogas, but the phenomenon of "no gas production" and "low gas production" was relatively common, preventing the biogasification work from proceeding normally; moreover, the cost was high, making it difficult to promote. Yao Yichang, a teacher at Youfangdian Township Primary School, successfully captured biogas in a sewage pond using a wooden box, proving that sewage ditches and ponds are an inexhaustible source of biogas. After discovering this new creation, the County Party Committee personally led experiments in Chengguan overnight, and held on-site meetings attended by cadres at all levels, which were quickly grasped by the masses. While utilizing natural biogas, the artificial biogas digesters were also reformed, changing the original sealed cover to a movable cover and adding a stirrer; the underground digester was also changed to a semi-underground digester (in summer, the temperature of the semi-underground digester is higher than that of the underground digester). In this way, pressure can be applied to the cover at any time, fermentation is faster, and more biogas is produced, thus solving the problem of "low gas production" and "no gas production" in artificial biogas digesters. At the same time, they also promoted the use of green bricks, sandstone, and earthen cement to replace steel and cement for digester construction, reducing the cost of the digesters. Subsequently, the County Party Committee relied on the masses to solve the difficulties of transporting and storing biogas. Their method is very simple: biogas is loaded into car tires and oilcloth bags from the "movable cover" that captures biogas through leather tubes, reed stalks, chicken intestines, and dog intestines, so that biogas can be moved; adding a "movable cover" to the water tank can store biogas; at the same time, they also found a way to burn biogas for cooking using the masses' existing pots, stoves and earthen furnaces. In addition, they also summarized and promoted the indigenous biogas light bulb method created by worker Huang Suying - it can be made with cotton yarn, toothpaste, water glass, and alum, and is exactly the same as a gas lamp bulb.
    Fuyang County attached importance to the indigenous methods created by the masses, and solved the key issues of capturing, transporting, storing, using biogas, and lighting one by one. The biogasification movement quickly took shape in the county. Now, the county has basically realized biogasification for cooking and lighting. Currently, they are further relying on the masses to study and solve the problem of biogas digesters in winter. (Yu Ming, Yu Feng)
    (Our Dispatch) Anhui Province's Fuyang Prefecture is promoting Fuyang County's experience in achieving biogasification through indigenous methods, striving to basically achieve biogasification throughout the prefecture by the end of this month.
    The key work for biogasification throughout the prefecture is to ensure that biogas can be used through the winter. In addition to taking measures to ensure that natural biogas continues to be produced in stagnant water ditches and ponds in winter, heated biogas digesters are now being vigorously built. 130,000 biogas digesters with a capacity of more than 100 cubic meters are to be built throughout the prefecture. The requirements for biogasification are that the vast majority of the masses in the prefecture use biogas for cooking, making tea, and lighting, and that a small number of biogas power stations be established. It is required that all of the more than 30,000 farmers' canteens that have been established throughout the prefecture first use biogas for cooking tea and lighting; more than 2,000 biogas tea supply stations are to be built along the main transportation routes throughout the prefecture; and biogas power stations are to be built using existing power equipment as much as possible to supply rural processing and lighting. At present, biogasification headquarters have been established at the prefectural and county levels, and biogasification camps, companies, and platoons are being established in districts, townships, and communes, led by the Party committee secretaries at each level, who personally take action to solve technical problems. Fuyang Prefecture has now built more than 220,000 small biogas digesters and more than 710,000 biogas jars, and 50% of the communes have basically achieved biogasification. (Yu Feng, Yu Ming)

### 点灯不用油　烧饭不发愁  安徽阜阳县家家户户用沼气照明做饭  阜阳专区在本月内将基本实现沼气化

　　点灯不用油　烧饭不发愁
    安徽阜阳县家家户户用沼气照明做饭
    阜阳专区在本月内将基本实现沼气化
    本报讯　阜阳县已基本实现了沼气化。全县三百三十一个农业社已普遍利用沼气煮饭、烧茶、照明（使用沼气的人口数已占全县总人口数80％），有些社已利用沼气发电。
    阜阳县是从今年3月中旬开始作沼气试验的。到最近全县已建造沼气池和沼气缸七万零六百九十四个，利用天然沼气沟、塘两万多处。
    阜阳县能在短期内基本实现沼气化，主要是县委加强了政治思想领导，充分发动群众，普遍采用土法上马而获得的。
    首先，他们依靠群众扩大了沼气的来源。当时各地建立的三百多个发酵池，都是用死盖发酵的办法培养沼气，“不出气”和“出气少”的现象较普遍，使沼气化工作不能正常进行；而且造价高，不易推广。油坊店乡小学教师姚奕昌在污水塘里用木箱捕捉沼气成功，证实了污水沟塘是沼气取之不竭的源泉。县委发现这一新创造后，便亲自领导在城关连夜试验，并召开各级干部参加的现场会议，很快为广大群众所掌握。在利用自然沼气的同时，对人造沼气池也进行了改造，把原来的死盖改为活动盖，增添了搅拌器；又把地下池改成了半地下池（夏季，半地下池温度较地下池高）。这样，可以随时在盖上加压力，发酵快，产生的沼气多，因此，解决了人造沼气池“出气少”“不出气”的问题。同时，他们又推广了用青砖、砂矼、土洋灰等代替钢筋水泥造池，减低了池子造价。此后，县委又依靠群众解决了输送和储藏沼气的困难。他们的办法很简单：通过皮管，苇秆、鸡肠、狗肠子，从捕捉沼气的“活动盖”中把沼气装在汽车内胎、油布包内，就可以使沼气搬家；在水缸上加“活动盖”就可以储藏沼气；同时也找到了用群众现有的锅灶和土炉就可燃烧沼气煮饭的办法。此外，还总结推广了工人黄素英所创造的土制沼气灯泡办法——用棉纱、牙膏、水玻璃和明矾就可制成，和气灯灯泡完全一样。
    阜阳县重视群众创造的土办法，把捕捉、运输、贮藏、使用沼气和点灯的关键问题都一一作了具体的解决，沼气化运动便在全县很快形成，现在全县基本上实现了煮饭、照明沼气化。现在正在进一步依靠群众研究解决沼气池过冬的问题。　　　（于明、于风）
    本报讯　安徽省阜阳专区正在推广阜阳县用土办法实现沼气化的经验，力争在本月底达到全专区基本上沼气化。
    全区沼气化的重点工作是保证沼气越冬，除采取措施解决死水沟塘冬天仍继续产生自然沼气外，现正大力兴建加温沼气池，全区要建一百立方公尺以上的沼气池十三万个。沼气化的要求是全区绝大多数群众使用沼气做饭、烧茶和点灯，并建立少数沼气发电站。要求全区已建立的三万多个农民食堂首先全部使用沼气做饭烧茶、点灯；在全区主要交通要道上分建两千多个沼气茶水供应站；尽量利用现有动力设备建二百二十个沼气动力站，供应农村加工和照明。现在全区专、县已建立了沼气化指挥部，区乡社正纷纷建立沼气化营、连、排组织，层层由党委书记挂帅，亲自动手，解决技术问题。阜阳专区现已建小型沼气池二十二万多个，沼气缸七十一万多个，50％的社已基本实现沼气化。　（于风、于明）
