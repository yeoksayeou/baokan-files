　　Adorable "Fifth Sister"

　　The Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe No. 2 came to Beijing and performed some good plays reflecting the new era and new life. "Fifth Sister," a play based on the people's anti-feudalism theme at the end of the Qing Dynasty, is also a good play.
　　"Fifth Sister" is adapted from a folk legend. It is said that this touching story originated in Jiashan County, and the elderly say that there really was such a person and such a thing. It is worth encouraging to adapt beautiful folk legends into dramas. The folk legends in various places are very rich and need drama workers to collect, write, and perform. In this way, it can both meet the needs of the people and enrich the repertoire.
　　Fifth Sister is the daughter of a declining landlord family, and she is deeply in love with Xu A'tian, a farmhand who is good at singing field songs. The two were childhood friends, but after growing up, the high wall of class separated them. The whole play unfolds with their sad farewell and reunion, but it actually reflects the class contradictions of that era. This is not a common vulgar love drama, but has a profound theme.
　　The landlord class was already in a declining era. Fifth Sister and Second Sister resisted their feudal family. Xu A'tian and his maternal uncle, Uncle Shou, not only dared to fight, but also had ways and wisdom, and finally achieved victory. Uncle Shou in particular is well-written and well-performed. At first, he advised Xu A'tian to be patient, but when it came to the critical moment of life and death when he could no longer bear it, he cleverly rescued the lovers and struck the villains. The image of this seasoned and admirable old farmer is unforgettable.
　　The creation of the character Fifth Sister is also successful. She is different from those oppressed women in ancient times. She carries more positive factors. She has no desperate wailing. Even when her evil brother forced her to commit suicide, she superficially complied but inwardly burned with anger, and finally jumped off the building and escaped. Wang Aiqin, who plays Fifth Sister, performed very well. She enabled us to see the ideological changes and development of this character, and aptly portrayed a naive, kind, and brave girl.
　　Other roles, such as Xu A'tian, Yang Jinyuan, Second Sister, and Aunt Qi, are all vividly portrayed, with skilled acting techniques. From the program notes, we can see that the actors playing these roles are only twenty-three or four years old; many of them are from cultural troupes. It is really not easy for them to reach such an artistic level in such a short period of time.
　　In terms of music, this play has undergone bold reforms, especially the male vocals, which have new creations. The stage design is both suitable for the development of the plot and quite beautiful.
　　Here, I would like to especially introduce the director of this play, Shen Chuan锟, who was originally an old artist of the Kunqu opera Chuan generation. He once wrote a good article: "How I Direct Modern Theme Operas," published in the eighth issue of the Drama Journal, which is a valuable experience. Thanks to his direction, "Fifth Sister" not only made good use of traditional techniques but also had new creations, so the entire performance was very harmonious and touching.
　　In short, I saw a satisfactory good play and would like to recommend it to audiences who have not yet seen it.

### 可爱的“五姑娘”

　　可爱的“五姑娘”
　　任桂林
    浙江省越剧二团来北京演出了一些反映新时代新生活的好戏。他们演出的以清末人民反封建为题材的“五姑娘”，也是一出好戏。
    “五姑娘”是根据民间传说编写的。据说这个动人的故事出在嘉善县，老年人说真有其人，实有其事。把优美的民间传说改编成戏剧，是值得鼓励的。各地的民间传说十分丰富，需要戏剧工作者们去搜集，编写，演出。这样，既能满足人民的需要，又能丰富上演剧目。
    五姑娘是个破落地主家庭的女儿，她热恋着善唱田歌的长工徐阿天。二人本是儿时的好友，但长大后，阶级的高墙隔断了他们。全剧是以他们的悲别欢聚来展开的，实际上却反映了那个时代的阶级矛盾。这不是一般庸俗的爱情戏，而是有着深刻的主题思想的。
    地主阶级已处在没落的时代。五姑娘、二姑娘反抗着自己的封建家庭。徐阿天和娘舅寿公公不但敢斗争，还有办法，有智慧，最后终于取得胜利。特别是寿公公写得好，演得好。最初他还劝徐阿天要忍耐，但到了忍无可忍的生死关头，他却巧计救走一对恋人，打击了恶人。这位饱经风霜、可敬佩的老农形象是令人难忘的。
    五姑娘这个人物的创造，也是成功的。她不同于古代那些受压迫的妇女，她身上带着更多的积极因素，她没有绝望的哀鸣，就是当她的恶哥哥逼她自尽的时候，她也是表面应付，内燃怒火，终于跳楼逃走。扮演五姑娘的王爱勤，演得很好。使我们看到这个人物的思想变化和发展，把一个天真、善良、勇敢的姑娘，恰如其分的刻画出来了。
    其他的脚色，如徐阿天、杨金元、二姑娘、七婶娘等，都演得活生活现，有着熟练的表演技巧。从说明书上看到扮演这些脚色的演员都不过二十三、四岁；不少是文工团员出身，他们在短短的期间，能够达到这样的艺术水平，实在是不容易的。
    这出戏的演出，在音乐上进行了大胆的改革，特别是男声的唱腔，有着新的创造。舞台设计既适合剧情的发展，又相当美观。
    在这里，我要特别介绍这个戏的导演沈传锟，他原是昆曲传字辈的老艺人。他曾写过一篇好文章：“我怎样排演现代题材的戏曲”，发表在戏剧报第八期上，是可贵的经验之谈。“五姑娘”由于他的导演，既很好地运用了传统技术，又有新的创造，因此整个演出是十分谐调而又感人的。
    总之，我看了一出满意的好戏，愿介绍给还没有看过的观众们。
