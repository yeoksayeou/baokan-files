Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 29th: More than 60,000 people in Guangzhou held demonstrations in different districts today, protesting the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

　　Demonstrations and rallies were held in the Eastern District and the Zhujiang District this morning, with more than 10,000 people participating. Liu Xiu, a female principal of an overseas Chinese primary school in her fifties, waved a paper flag in the parade, leading a group of teachers. She used to be a primary school teacher in Hong Kong, and returned to Guangzhou in 1950 due to continuous persecution by the British authorities in Hong Kong. While walking, she angrily denounced: I am used to the tricks of the British authorities in Hong Kong in undermining the Chinese people's education cause. When I was teaching in Hong Kong, a meeting of five teachers was also considered illegal. Now they are using the excuse of a "dangerous building" to close the Chung Wah Middle School and beat teachers, students, and reporters. We must settle this new and old score with British imperialism.

　　This afternoon, more than 40,000 people from the Southern, Western, Northern, and Central Districts marched and rallied in pouring rain. They shouted slogans in the heavy rain and marched forward vigorously against the rain. Residents of Lingnan Street on June 23rd Road, who were already familiar with the hideous faces of British imperialism, walked at the forefront of the Central District residents' contingent. Yesterday, when more than 1,000 of them held a protest meeting in front of the Anti-Imperialist Monument in Saiki, they recited a poem full of new and old hatred, as a vow to protest the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong: "Undermining education is most obvious, abusing reporters is a serious crime, journalism and education should be respected, how can you be allowed to be so reckless... Painfully remembering the Saiki Massacre, the blood stains are still not avenged, protect our rights and watch the future, bow your heads to apologize and compensate; the power of the Chinese sons and daughters is great, new and old hatreds must be settled, present vows before the Martyrs' Monument, work together to produce and surpass the US and Britain." Many of the residents living in Qingping Street witnessed the Saiki Massacre. They wrote more than forty folk songs condemning the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong on large paper signs and held the signs high to participate in the parade.

　　At the protest meeting of more than 13,000 people in the Northern District, nearly 300 workers who had just returned from Hong Kong and Macau to participate in construction could not suppress the anger in their hearts and denounced the British authorities in Hong Kong for their consistent undermining of the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 29th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee, the heads of the provincial and municipal organizations of various democratic parties, and non-party figures held a meeting today to strongly protest the British authorities in Hong Kong for unreasonably and forcibly closing the Chung Wah Middle School and the barbaric beatings of the school's teachers, students, and Chinese journalists by the Hong Kong police. They also expressed great anger at the incidents of British military aircraft repeatedly violating China's airspace. More than sixty people who attended the meeting unanimously expressed their support for the two serious protest notes submitted by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government. They warned the British authorities in Hong Kong that if they are obsessed with their own ways, they must be prepared to bear all possible consequences. The provincial and municipal CPPCC and local organizations of various democratic parties had already held meetings to protest the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong on the evening of the 26th of this month after receiving news of the persecution of Chung Wah Middle School by the British authorities in Hong Kong. Zhang Boquan, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, pointed out at today's meeting that the recent incidents show that the British government intends to cooperate with US imperialism to continue to create tension in Asia and continue to implement a policy of hostility towards China and conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He said that this is a great insult to the Chinese people, and we must never tolerate it. We firmly support the two notes submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government and warn the British authorities in Hong Kong that they must immediately stop provocative activities, punish the murderers, apologize, and compensate for all losses.

　　Chen Rutang, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Wang Yue, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and Vice President of Jinan University, Huang Youmou, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society and Vice President of South China Normal College, Zhang Ruiquan, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Mei Rixin, head of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Xiao Junying, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, also spoke at the meeting. Everyone unanimously agreed that the two protest notes issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government represent the angry voice of China's 600 million people. The Chinese people have shown the greatest patience with a series of hostile acts by the British authorities in Hong Kong. If they dare to continue provoking, they must bear all possible consequences.

　　Mo Yingyu, a member of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, graduated from the London Law School, worked as a Chinese-English barrister in Hong Kong, and returned to Guangzhou in 1952. He pointed out at the meeting that the series of atrocities by the British authorities in Hong Kong are a resounding slap in the face to their own so-called "laws." He said that the British authorities in Hong Kong's use of violence to close Chung Wah Middle School and beat unarmed teachers, students, and reporters is undeniable.

　　抗议香港英国当局的暴行
    广州六万多人举行示威游行
    广东省和广州市政协举行集会
    新华社广州29日电　广州市人民今天分区举行了六万多人的示威大游行，抗议香港英国当局的暴行。
    东区和珠江区都在今天上午举行示威游行和集会，有一万多人参加。五十多岁的华侨小学女校长刘秀在游行中挥舞着手上的纸旗，带领着一群教师行进。她曾是香港的小学教师，1950年在香港英国当局的不断迫害下，回到广州来。她一边走一边愤怒地控诉说：香港英国当局摧残中国人民教育事业的伎俩我见惯了，我在香港教书时，五个教师在一起开会也被认为非法。现在又以什么“危楼”为借口封闭中华中学校舍，殴辱师生和记者，这笔新仇旧恨，我们一定要向英帝国主义清算。
    今天下午南区、西区、北区、中区四万多群众的游行和集会，都是在倾盆大雨中进行的。他们在暴雨中高喊着口号，用有力的步伐迎着大雨挺进。早就熟悉英帝国主义狰狞面目的六二三路岭南街的居民走在中区居民队伍的前列，昨天他们一千多人在沙基反帝纪念碑前举行抗议大会时，朗诵了一首充满新仇旧恨的诗歌，当作抗议香港英国当局暴行的誓词：“摧残教育最明显，殴辱记者罪不轻，新闻教育应尊重，岂容放肆把凶逞……痛忆当年沙基案，血迹斑斑恨未平，保我权利观后效，低头赔罪且容情；中华儿女力量大，新仇旧恨要算清，烈士碑前呈誓语，合力生产超美英”。居住在清平街的居民不少是沙基惨案的目击者，他们把几天来赶作的四十多首斥责香港英国当局暴行的民歌写在大幅纸牌上，高举着纸牌参加游行。
    在北区一万三千多人的抗议大会上，有近三百名刚从香港和澳门回来参加建设的工人，他们一个个捺不住心头的怒火，控诉香港英国当局一贯破坏中国人民的罪行。
    新华社广州29日电　政协广东省委员会、广州市委员会、各民主党派省市组织负责人和无党派人士，今日集会强烈抗议香港英国当局无理强行封闭中华中学校舍和香港警察野蛮殴打该校师生和中国新闻记者的暴行。对英国军事飞机多次侵犯中国领空的事件，也表示极大愤怒。六十多个参加会议的人一致表示拥护我外交部向英国政府提出的两项严重抗议照会。他们警告香港英国当局说，如果香港英国当局执迷不悟，就必须准备承担一切可能的后果。省市政协和各民主党派地方组织，早在本月26日晚接到香港英国当局迫害中华中学的事件消息后，便已经举行集会，抗议香港英国当局的暴行。政协广东省委员会副主席张?村，在今天的集会上指出，最近发生的这些事件，表明英国政府有意配合美帝国主义，继续在亚洲制造紧张局势，继续执行敌视中国、阴谋制造“两个中国”的政策。他说，这是对中国人民莫大的污辱，我们绝不能容忍下去。我们坚决拥护外交部向英国政府提出的两项照会，并警告香港英国当局，必须立即停止挑衅活动，惩办凶手，道歉并赔偿一切损失。
    中国国民党革命委员会广东省委主任委员陈汝棠，民主同盟广东省委副主任委员、暨南大学副校长王越，九三学社广州分社副主委、华南师范学院副院长黄友谋，民主促进会广州市委员会副主任委员张瑞权，农工民主党广东省委员会负责人梅日新，政协广东省委员会副主席萧隽英等都在会上发言，大家一致认为我国外交部向英国政府发出的两项抗议照会，代表了中国六亿人民愤怒的呼声。中国人民对香港英国当局一系列的敌意行为已表现了最大的忍耐，如果他们敢于继续挑衅就必须承担一切可能的后果。
    政协广州市委员会委员莫应溎是在伦敦法学院毕业、曾在香港作过中英大律师、1952年才回到广州的。他在会上指出，香港英国当局一连串的暴行，正是对它自己所订的所谓“法律”打了响亮的耳光。他说香港英国当局用暴力封闭中华中学校舍，并殴打手无寸铁的师生记者一事，是无法狡赖的。
