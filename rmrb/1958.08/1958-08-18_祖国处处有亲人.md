　　Everywhere in the Motherland are Loved Ones
　　One day, I was on duty in the waiting room when a military family member, Liu Guimei, approached me with a problem. She was from Xiangyin County, Hunan, and was trying to get to Nvgushan Village in Laoshan District, Qingdao. While changing trains here, she accidentally lost her ticket. She only had three yuan on her, but the ticket to Qingdao cost over eleven yuan. She asked me what to do, tears welling up in her eyes. As I was considering a solution, a young man suddenly stood up beside me and handed me ten yuan, asking me to give it to Comrade Liu Guimei to buy a ticket home. When I gave the money to Comrade Liu Guimei, she was so moved that she immediately wanted me to tell her where this young man worked. The young man walked over with a smile and said, "Why ask for my work unit? I should do this!" Because Comrade Liu Guimei repeatedly asked him to give her his address and name, he finally said, "If you have money to return to me, please send it to Ju Yuting, Chijia Township, Wulian County, Shandong Province." I turned back and saw the words "Hankou Technical School" gleaming on the badge on his chest. Before I could ask any further questions, he had already walked away. An old woman watched his back for a long time and said, "In the world led by Chairman Mao, there are loved ones everywhere."

　　祖国处处有亲人
    一天，我正在候车室值勤，一位军人家属刘桂梅找我解决一个困难，她是从湖南湘阴县来，要到青岛崂山区女姑山村去。到这里转车不小心，把车票丢了。身上只有三元钱，而去青岛的票价却要十一元多。她问我怎么办？一面说，一面掉下了眼泪。我正在考虑解决的办法，忽然从旁边站起来一位年青人交给我十元钱，让我转给刘桂梅同志买票回家。当我把钱交给刘桂梅同志时，她激动得要我马上告诉她这位年青人在哪儿工作？年青人走过来笑嘻嘻地说：“问我的工作单位干吗？我应该这样做嘛！”因为刘桂梅同志一再要他告诉住址和姓名，他才说：“如果你有钱要还我的话，请寄到山东省五莲县迟家乡鞠玉亭家收吧。”我回头看见他胸前证章上闪着“汉口技校”四个字。再未来得及详细问，他已经走远了。一位老大娘看着他的背影好久才说：“毛主席领导的天下，处处有亲人。”　　　　　　　　　徐州车站公安派出所民警　王之友
