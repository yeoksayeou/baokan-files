Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 8th: A mass inspection campaign involving a million people is underway in Hebei Province, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn grain, a bumper harvest of steel, and striving to have the three "Marshals" take command. Secretaries of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee are personally guiding this movement, and many responsible cadres in various regions have gone deep into the fields and factories. Cadres from the Tianjin Special District have formed ten inspection groups to go to the countryside and work with farmers to improve autumn field management. Led by the Provincial Party Secretary and the Governor, inspection teams from provincial-level organizations, headed by the principal responsible cadres of various departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, will soon begin working in the fields and factories.

On the afternoon of August 7th, Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Governor of Hebei Province, gave a mobilization report to cadres of provincial-level organizations on comprehensively launching the mass inspection movement. Liu Zihou pointed out that the situation of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has taken shape in Hebei Province. The province's summer harvest crop output reached 6.55 billion jin this year, an increase of 78 percent over last year. The industrial output value in the first half of this year reached 3.976 billion yuan, an increase of 35 percent over the same period last year. More than 1.04 million small factories have been established. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses have greatly liberated their thinking and achieved even greater achievements in all aspects. The purpose of this trip to the countryside and factories is to promptly inspect and discover problems, solve problems, promote the current production movement, connect with the masses, overcome bureaucracy, liberate thinking, improve understanding, and promote production to a higher level.

Liu Zihou emphasized that the current central task is to have the "three Marshals" take command and pave the way for the "two pioneers." Therefore, everyone going down should mainly focus on grain and steel. When grasping steel, the focus should be on indigenous iron smelting and small blast furnaces. When grasping grain, the current task is to focus on field management, while also grasping fertilizer accumulation, deep plowing, and tool reform. Wheat fields this year must reach more than 30,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu and deep plowing of more than 1.5 chi, striving to achieve even greater wheat yield increases next year than this year. In the second half of this year, we must achieve semi-mechanization of farm tools and ensure water for wheat planting, and make necessary preparations for large-scale water conservancy projects this winter and next spring. Cadres in some industrial departments should also go down to inspect the production of the machinery industry and promote the "Marshal" of machinery to take command. This major inspection will also include a side inspection of the leap forward in commerce, culture, and education.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 8th: The Shandong Provincial Party Committee has decided to organize a million-strong inspection army to participate in inspection groups at all levels to strengthen autumn field management. They will not leave the fields until a comprehensive bumper harvest is achieved in the autumn.

In order to rapidly promote this inspection, the Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference on the evening of the 7th, attended by secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees. Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, conveyed the decision of the Provincial Party Committee to implement the Central Committee's August 1st notice on strengthening autumn grain field management.

1. All inspection teams that have already departed will be extended until the end of September. All cadres that can be transferred from all levels of the province, prefecture, county, township, and commune must be transferred to participate in inspection teams and groups. A million-strong inspection army will be formed throughout the province to participate in field inspections. 2. The focus of the inspection should be firmly grasped in improving the field management of autumn grain, and in the six-no movement centered on topdressing, namely, no missing seedlings, no gaps in rows, no waterlogging or drought disasters, no barren or thin land, no weeds, no diseases or insect pests, and no third-class crops.

In order to strengthen autumn field management, the Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to promote the leadership methods of Shou Zhang County within a time limit, and to promote the leadership methods of Wen Shang County of "four to the fields," namely, cadres go to the fields, meetings and office work are held in the fields, accommodation is in the fields, and rectification and big-character posters are in the fields.

The Provincial Party Committee requires cadres at all levels to resolutely step out of the office, put down their airs, share weal and woe with the masses, and work together, so as to promptly discover and solve problems. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this major inspection is a practical rectification, and whether a comprehensive bumper harvest can be achieved in the autumn is one of the important signs to measure whether the rectification in various places is good or not.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th: Townships and communes in Jiangsu Province have begun to conduct major inspections of late autumn crops and are stepping up field management work.

Provincial, prefectural, and county party committee inspection teams have gone to townships and communes to help with work. Before and after the inspection teams went to the countryside, various townships and communes also mobilized the masses to carry out self-inspection movements. Jiangyin County organized cadres and farmers to inspect every piece of land by township. Through piece-by-piece inspection, the 23 agricultural cooperatives in Xixi Township, Dongtai County, changed the original target of 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu into a guaranteed target, and also formulated specific measures. While conducting self-inspections, various townships and communes also launched mutual inspection and competition activities.

During this period, whenever comrades from provincial, prefectural, and county party committee inspection teams went to a township, they went deep into the fields with township and commune cadres and veteran farmers to discover experiences and promote them on the spot; they immediately solved any problems they found. The farmers said that the inspection team was a promotion team and also a labor team.

    力争秋粮大丰收  力争钢铁大丰收
    百万检查大军奔赴田间工厂
    河北山东江苏大抓秋田管理和工具改革
    据新华社天津8日电  一个力争秋粮大丰收，力争钢铁大丰收，力争三大“元帅”升帐的百万人大检查运动已在河北省开始。中共河北省委书记处的书记们亲自指导这个运动，不少地区的负责干部已经深入到田间、工厂。天津专区机关干部组成十个检查团下乡和农民一起，搞好秋田管理工作。以省委书记、省长为首，由省委各部委、省人民委员会各厅局主要负责干部率领的省级机关检查团，日内即到田间、工厂工作。
    8月7日下午，中共河北省委书记处书记、河北省省长刘子厚，向省级机关干部做了全面开展大检查运动的动员报告。刘子厚指出，当前河北省工农业生产大跃进的形势已经形成。全省今年夏收作物产量达到六十五亿五千万斤，较去年提高百分之七十八，今年上半年工业产值达到三十九亿七千六百万元，较去年同期提高百分之三十五，小型工厂达到一百零四万多个。广大群众在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，思想大解放，各方面都取得了更大的成绩。这次下乡下厂的目的，就是为了及时检查发现问题，解决问题，推动当前的生产运动，联系群众，克服官僚主义，解放思想提高认识，推动生产，更上一层楼。
    刘子厚强调指出当前的中心任务是让“三大元帅”升帐，为“二个先行官”开道。因此，大家下去，主要是抓粮食、抓铁。在抓铁时，主要抓土法炼铁和小高炉。抓粮食，当前就是要抓田间管理，同时要抓积肥，抓深翻，抓工具改革。今年麦地一定要达到亩施底肥三万斤以上，深翻一尺半以上，力争实现明年小麦比今年增产更多。今年下半年一定要实现农具半机械化，并且保证种麦的用水，作好今冬明春大兴水利的一些必要的准备工作，一些工业部门的干部还要下去检查机械工业的生产情况，促使机械这个“元帅”升帐。这次大检查还要附带检查商业、文教等工作跃进的情况。
    新华社济南8日电  中共山东省委决定组织一百万检查大军，参加各级检查团、组，加强秋田管理，不实现秋季全面大丰收，决不离田。
    为迅速推动这一检查，省委7日晚召开了地、市委书记参加的电话会议，省委书记处书记谭启龙传达了省委执行中央8月1日加强秋粮田间管理的通知的决定。
    一、凡是已经出发的检查团，一律延到9月底结束，省、地、县、乡、社各级，所有能抽调的干部，都要抽调出来，参加检查团、组，在全省范围内要组成一百万人参加的检查大军，参加田间检查。二、检查中心应狠狠抓住搞好秋粮的田间管理，搞好追肥为中心的六无运动，即无缺苗断垅、无水旱灾害、无瘦田薄地、无杂草、无病虫害、无三类作物。
    为加强秋田管理，省委要求各地限期推广寿张县的领导方法，和推广汶上县四到田的领导方法，即干部到田、开会办公到田、住宿到田、整风、大字报到田。
    省委要求各级干部坚决走出办公室、放下架子，和群众同甘苦，同劳动，做到及时发现与解决问题。省委认为，这次大检查，就是实际的整风，秋季能否全面大丰收，就是衡量各地整风好不好的重要标志之一。
    新华社南京8日电  江苏省的乡乡社社开始对晚秋作物进行大检查，并突击加强田间管理工作。
    省、地、县委检查团，已经分头深入乡社帮助工作。在检查团下乡的前后，各乡各社也发动群众开展自查运动。江阴县以乡为单位，组织干部和农民检查每一块土地。东台县西溪乡二十三个农业社，通过逐块检查，将原订亩产一千五百斤子棉争取指标改为保证指标，同时还订出具体措施。各乡、社在自查的同时，还展开了互查竞赛活动。
    这一期间，省、地、县委检查团同志们每到一乡，就和乡、社干部、老农一齐深入田头，发现经验，现场推广；发现问题，立即解决。农民们说检查团是促进团，又是劳动团。
