Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th—Qionghai's entire party and all people are learning science, and popular science work has moved to the front lines of production. The county has absorbed 85% of farmers with labor power to participate in agricultural technical schools at all levels, and has trained 2,208 backbones with primary agricultural technology.

    The most prominent feature of Qionghai County's popular science and technology work is that the Party Committee takes the lead, regarding popular science organizations as an important tool to promote technological reform, and popular science and technology work as a major key to increase production. During the spring ploughing this year, the county party committee put forward the battle slogan of "The whole party runs popular science, the whole people run popular science; the whole party learns science, the whole people learn science." Popular science work is led by the party secretary from the county to the township to the commune, and all relevant departments cooperate with each other. At present, all townships in the county have established popular science members' work committees and intermediate agricultural technical schools, and all agricultural cooperatives have established primary agricultural technical schools and technical research offices. Production teams also run agricultural technology popularization schools.

    Oriented towards production is another very prominent feature of Qionghai County's popular science and technology work. They do not generally combine with production, let alone lag behind production, but push popular science work to the forefront of production to eliminate various obstacles for production. They can ensure that every production link has technical measures, production and technical measures are deployed at the same time, and they can go deep into production, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, truly achieving "research is included for difficulties, experience is included for promotion, and measures are included for implementation." For example, in March of this year, there was a drought, and the progress of planting sugar cane in Qionghai was very slow. Only more than 40,000 mu of the county's 80,000 mu sugar cane task had been completed, and the masses doubted whether sugar cane could be planted in the drought. The Qionghai County Science and Technology Popularization Association, based on this situation and joint research with the Agricultural Bureau, timely proposed technical measures such as seed soaking and germination, dipping sugar cane seedlings in fertilizer, applying wet fertilizer, covering with aquatic plants, deep plowing and planting, and covering with soil. With the support of the county party committee and the county people's committee, it was fully promoted, so that the county's task of planting sugar cane was completed on schedule.

    Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association held an on-site meeting in Qionghai County and decided to comprehensively promote the experience of Qionghai County's science and technology popularization work.

### 科普工作走上生产最前线　广东琼山县全党全民学科学

　　科普工作走上生产最前线
　　广东琼山县全党全民学科学
    新华社广州15日电　琼山全党全民学科学，科普工作已走上生产最前线。全县共吸收了85％的有劳动力的农民参加到各级农业技术学校中学习，共培养出二千二百零八名具有初级农业技术的骨干。
    琼山县科学技术普及工作最突出的特点是党委挂帅，把科普组织作为促进技术改革的重要工具，把科学技术普及工作当作增加生产的主要关键。今年春耕时，县委提出了“全党办科普，全民办科普；全党学科学，全民学科学”的战斗口号，科普工作从县到乡到社都由党委书记挂帅，各有关部门互相协作。目前全县各乡镇都成立了科普会员工作委员会和中级农业技术学校，各农业社成立了初级农业技术学校和技术研究室，生产队也办农业技术普及学校。
    面向生产，是琼山县科学技术普及工作另一个非常突出的特点。他们不是一般地结合生产，更不是拖在生产后面，而是将科普工作推到生产的最前线，为生产扫除各种障碍。他们能够做到个个生产环节都有技术措施，生产与技术措施同时布置，并能深入生产、发现问题、及时解决，真正做到“有困难包研究，有经验包推广，有措施包贯彻”。如今年3月间天旱，琼山种植甘蔗进度很慢，全县八万亩的甘蔗任务仅完成四万多亩，群众都怀疑天旱究竟能否种蔗，琼山县科学技术普及协会根据这种情况和农业局共同研究，及时提出采用浸种催芽、蘸蔗苗肥、施湿肥、盖水草、深耕种植、加盖土等技术措施，在县委、县人民委员会的支持下全面推广，使全县种植甘蔗的任务如期完成。
    最近，广东省科学技术普及协会在琼山县召开了现场会议，决定全面推广琼山县科学技术普及工作的经验。
