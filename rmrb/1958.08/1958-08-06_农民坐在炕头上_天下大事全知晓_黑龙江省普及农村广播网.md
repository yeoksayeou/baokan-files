    Farmers Sitting on Their Kangs Know All the Important Events of the World:
    Heilongjiang Province Popularizes Rural Broadcasting Network

    (Our Correspondent Jiao Huadong reports) Heilongjiang Province has completed the task of universally establishing a rural broadcasting network ahead of schedule.

    As of July 31, Heilongjiang Province had 228,339 loudspeakers distributed throughout the rural areas of the province. 100% of townships had wired broadcasting, 84.34% of agricultural production cooperatives had it, and 55.05% of production teams had it. Farmers in remote villages, like farmers in counties near the eight cities such as Harbin and Qiqihar, can sit on their kangs and hear the instructions of the Central Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, hear important domestic and international news, and hear the voices of the people across the country building socialism. The broad masses of farmers call the loudspeakers "clairaudient ears."

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels throughout the province regard rural broadcasting as an important tool for directing production, launching the Great Leap Forward in production, publicizing the central government's policies and guidelines, and conducting ideological education for the masses. They regard broadcasting as a powerful weapon for rapidly promoting the Great Leap Forward in work. In the past six months, in the movements of water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, livestock protection, spring plowing and sowing, literacy campaigns, eliminating the four pests, and afforestation, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have successively convened and held eleven broadcasting conferences and special broadcasts, so that work measures that would have taken ten days or half a month to make known to every household in the past can now be spread throughout the province in a matter of minutes.

    The rural broadcasting network also plays a significant role in changing the people's political and ideological outlook and raising the political awareness of farmers. Now, the farmers of Heilongjiang Province have universally adopted "striving to be advanced," "Great Leap Forward," "more, faster, better, and more economical," "riding rockets," and "catching up with satellites" as slogans for practical action. In Yushan Agricultural Production Cooperative of Gaotai Township, Yanshou County, there was no rain for sixty consecutive days last summer. In some production teams without loudspeakers, some people wanted to pray for rain; in production teams with loudspeakers, the team members heard the broadcasted rain forecast and dissuaded the farmers who wanted to pray for rain. A few days later, it did rain, breaking the superstitious idea of praying for rain.

    In developing the broadcasting undertaking, Heilongjiang Province has achieved rapid development in the establishment of the rural broadcasting network because it closely relies on the Party and the masses. In most counties, the county Party secretaries personally took charge, mobilizing all forces to participate in the construction. The first secretary of Fujin County personally took charge, mobilizing all forces to lead the establishment of the broadcasting network. At the same time, the masses of the county were mobilized to raise iron wire, wooden poles, and other materials and equipment. Some farmers, in order to solve the difficulty of lacking equipment for erecting broadcasting lines, took out the iron wire for drying clothes and the wood prepared for building new houses. The county raised eighteen tons of iron wire in one day. In addition, more than 300 rural broadcasting enthusiasts and demobilized soldiers were mobilized and concentrated for one day of training to serve as the backbone force for establishing the broadcasting network. After twenty days of hard work, the rural broadcasting network was popularized throughout the county.

    In the work of establishing the broadcasting network, the broad masses used indigenous methods to measure, bury poles, and erect lines, overcoming many technical difficulties. Liu Zhizhong, a member of Minshu Agricultural Cooperative of Xingfu Township, Suihua County, created a method of using wooden troughs to pass through the railway from the ground instead of using wooden poles to pass over the railway in solving the difficulty of broadcasting lines crossing the railway. Many broadcasting stations were built and managed by the masses through fundraising.

    In the work of establishing the rural broadcasting network, Heilongjiang Province also organized socialist cooperation on a large scale. Through the organization of large-scale production cooperation, the province can produce 300,000 loudspeakers this year, which can basically meet the needs of the province. Various counties cooperated with postal and telecommunications, commercial, and other departments in the work of establishing the rural broadcasting network. After completing the work of establishing the rural broadcasting network in its own county, Fujin County took the initiative to send two technicians with a batch of iron wire and loudspeakers to support the neighboring Luobei County in popularizing the broadcasting network.

    农民坐在炕头上  天下大事全知晓
    黑龙江省普及农村广播网
    本报讯　记者焦化东报道：黑龙江省已经提前完成了普遍建立农村广播网的任务。
    到7月31日，黑龙江省已有二十二万八千三百三十九只广播喇叭分布在全省农村，有了有线广播的乡镇达100％，农业生产合作社达84.34％，生产队达55.05％。在偏僻乡村的农民，也和靠近哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等八个城市的各县农民一样，坐在炕头上就能听到中央和黑龙江省委的指示，听到国内外重要新闻，听到全国各地人民建设社会主义的声音。广大农民把广播喇叭叫作“顺风耳”。
    中共黑龙江省委和全省各级党委，把农村广播作为指挥生产、发动生产大跃进、宣传中央的方针政策和对群众进行思想教育的重要工具，把广播作为最快速地推动工作大跃进的有力武器。半年来，在兴修水利、积肥、保畜、春耕播种、扫盲、除四害、绿化造林等运动中，中共黑龙江省委和省人民委员会先后召开和举办了十一次广播大会和专题广播，使得在过去需要十天半月才能作到家喻户晓的工作措施，几十分钟内就传遍全省。
    农村广播网对改变人民政治思想面貌和提高农民政治觉悟，也起着很大的作用。现在，黑龙江省的农民已经普遍把“争上游”、“大跃进”、“多快好省”、“乘火箭”、“赶卫星”作为实际行动的口号。延寿县高台乡玉山农业生产合作社，去年夏季一连六十天没有下雨，在几个没有广播喇叭的生产队里，有人想求雨；在装有广播喇叭的生产队，队员们听到了广播大雨预告消息，就把想求雨的农民劝止住了。几天以后，果然下了大雨，打破了想求雨的迷信思想。
    黑龙江省在发展广播事业中，由于紧密地依靠党、依靠群众，因此，建立农村广播网的工作得到飞跃发展。大部分县的县委书记亲自挂帅，调动各个方面的力量参加建设。富锦县的第一书记亲自挂帅，调动了各方面的力量领导建立广播网的工作。同时，发动全县群众筹集铁丝、木杆和其它物资器材。有些农民为了解决架设广播线路缺乏器材的困难，把晒衣服的铁丝和准备盖新房子的木料都拿出来。全县一天就筹集到铁丝十八吨。此外，还动员了三百多名农村的广播爱好者和转业军人，集中训练一天，作为建立广播网的骨干力量。经过二十天苦战，普及了全县农村广播网。
    在建立广播网工作中，广大群众用土办法进行测量、埋杆、架线，克服了许多技术上的困难。绥化县兴福乡民树农业社社员刘志忠在解决广播线穿过铁道的困难时，创造了利用木槽由地面穿过铁路的办法，代替用木杆架空穿过铁路。许多广播站都是群众集资兴建，自己管理。
    黑龙江省在建立农村广播网工作中，还组织了社会主义大协作。经过组织生产大协作，今年全省能生产三十万只喇叭，基本上可以满足全省的需要。各县在建立农村广播网工作中，同邮电、商业等部门进行协作。富锦县在完成本县的建立农村广播网工作后，主动派两名技术人员携带一批铁丝和喇叭支援邻近的萝北县普及广播网。
