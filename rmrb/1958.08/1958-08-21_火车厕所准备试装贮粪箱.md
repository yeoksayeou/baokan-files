　　Train Toilets to be Fitted with Holding Tanks for Trial Use

　　We have received the letters forwarded by the editorial department. In the past, we often received similar letters from the people suggesting that holding tanks be installed in train toilets to store feces for fertilizer production. We have studied this suggestion many times, but it has not been implemented because we could not solve the problems of foul odor and winter freezing of feces.

　　Recently, we studied this issue again. In order to fully consider the opinions of the broad masses, we have decided to conduct key trials in the Shanghai, Beijing, and Qiqihar Railway Administrations first. Currently, these units are actively preparing to install holding tanks for trial use.　　Bureau of Vehicles, Ministry of Railways

　　火车厕所准备试装贮粪箱
    编辑部转来的信件收到了。过去，我们也常收到同样的人民来信，建议在火车上的厕所里装贮粪箱，以便把粪便积存下来制造肥料。我们对这个建议研究过多次，因为无法解决透臭味和冬季粪便冻结的问题，所以没有实行。
    最近，我们又研究了这个问题。为了充分考虑广大群众的意见，我们决定先在上海、北京和齐齐哈尔等三个铁路管理局进行重点试验。现在，这几个单位正在积极准备试装贮粪箱。  铁道部车辆局
