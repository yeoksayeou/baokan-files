Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 20th. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio today expressed unease about the landing of U.S. troops in Singapore. He said that because the Middle East situation has not been resolved and the domestic rebellion in Indonesia has not been completely quelled, the landing of U.S. Marines in Singapore is "very worrying."

In response to reporters' questions about the U.S. Marines landing in Singapore, he said that the news gives the impression that Southeast Asia has become a new focus of international disputes.

The Foreign Minister told reporters about the peculiar explanation given by the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia regarding the U.S. military landing in Singapore. Subandrio said that he received an explanation from U.S. Ambassador Jones yesterday, who said that the U.S. troops went to Singapore merely for "entertainment" and would not stay there long. Subandrio continued, saying that in the current atmosphere, the Indonesian government hopes that when foreign troops conduct activities near Indonesia, they can notify the Indonesian government in advance to avoid arousing suspicion among the Indonesian people.

Jakarta newspapers today condemned the U.S. military landing in Singapore as a direct threat to Indonesia's security and peace, and demanded that the U.S. military withdraw from Singapore immediately.

The "People's Daily" said in an editorial that the purpose of the U.S. military landing in Singapore is not Singapore but Indonesia. The newspaper said that now, "the enemy's bayonet is not pointed at our back, but at our throat." The newspaper said that no matter what excuse the United States uses to send troops to Singapore, we must demand that it withdraw its troops from there immediately.

"Dongxing Bao" said that as far as Indonesia is concerned, the U.S. military landing in Singapore is as much an intervention and aggression as the U.S. military landing in the Middle East.

The newspaper pointed out the danger of the U.S. military landing in Singapore, saying that Singapore and Indonesia are close neighbors, and Singapore is a channel for Indonesia's foreign communications, especially Indonesia's foreign trade. The newspaper also said that Singapore has always been a haven for subversives, spies, and smugglers who oppose Indonesia. The newspaper said that there is ample evidence that the American rulers support Indonesian rebel groups. With the U.S. military landing in Singapore, their interference in Indonesia and support for subversive groups may take open forms.

"Duli Bao" said in an editorial that based on past experience, Indonesia cannot agree to the United States stationing a fleet very close to the Indonesian border. The newspaper demanded that the United States withdraw its navy from Singapore as soon as possible.

　　美国刺刀指向印度尼西亚
    雅加达报纸痛斥美军登陆新加坡
    新华社雅加达20日电  印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天对美军在新加坡登陆表示不安。他说，由于中东局势还未解决，而印度尼西亚国内的叛乱还未完全平定，美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆一事是“十分令人担心的”。
    他在回答新闻记者提出的关于美国海军陆战队在新加坡登陆的问题时说，这一消息给人的印象是，东南亚已经成为国际纠纷的新的焦点。
    这位外交部长把美国驻印度尼西亚大使对美军登陆新加坡一事所作的奇特的解释告诉了新闻记者。苏班德里约说，他昨天得到了美国大使琼斯的解释，据琼斯说，美军去新加坡只不过是轮流“娱乐”，他们不会在那里呆很久。苏班德里约接着说，在目前的气氛下，印度尼西亚政府希望外国军队在印度尼西亚附近进行活动的时候，能事先通知印度尼西亚政府，以免引起印度尼西亚人民的怀疑。
    雅加达报纸今天谴责美军在新加坡登陆是对印度尼西亚的安全和和平的直接威胁，报纸要求美军立即从新加坡撤退。
    “人民日报”在社论中说，美军在新加坡登陆的目的不在于新加坡而在于印度尼西亚。这家报纸说，现在，“敌人的刺刀不是指向我们的背，而是指向我们的喉咙。”这家报纸说，不管美国利用什么借口派兵在新加坡登陆，我们都必须要求它立即从那里撤退它的军队。
    “东星报”说，就印度尼西亚而论，美军在新加坡登陆就同美军在中东登陆一样地是干涉和侵略。
    这家报纸指出美军在新加坡登陆的危险性说，新加坡和印度尼西亚是近邻，新加坡是印度尼西亚的对外交通、尤其是印度尼西亚的对外贸易的一条通道。这家报纸还说，新加坡一向是一个反对印度尼西亚的颠复分子、间谍和走私贩子的巢穴。这家报纸说，已经有充分事实证明美国统治者支持印度尼西亚叛乱集团。随着美军在新加坡登陆，他们对印度尼西亚的干涉和对颠复集团的支持就有可能采取公开形式。
    “独立报”在社论中说，根据过去的经验，印度尼西亚不能同意美国在离印度尼西亚边境很近的地方驻扎舰队。这家报纸要求美国尽速从新加坡撤退它的海军。
