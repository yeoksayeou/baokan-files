The Fury of the Caribbean Coast
—A Message to the Revolutionary Brothers of Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba
Huang Shaoxiang

The two giants, China and the Soviet Union, have issued a resounding call: we must defend peace, stop aggression, and give strong support to national liberation movements in any region of the world! This call has resounded throughout the world and has also shaken the land of Latin America. At this moment, the heroic people of Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba, who have just achieved initial results in their anti-imperialist struggle, will surely welcome this great and powerful support from the socialist camp with excitement, and advance with even greater confidence!

Haiti and Cuba, beautiful islands located in the Caribbean Sea, your rich mineral and agricultural resources have only brought you great misfortune in the past, inviting the greedy plunder of imperialists, especially the American imperialists. Venezuela, rich in oil and iron ore, has provided American monopoly capitalists with huge profits, while bringing only poverty and disaster to your own people. However, imperialist plunder and aggression can only arouse resistance from the oppressed people. National liberation movements are surging on your lands, and an increasing number of patriotic people are involved in the sacred struggle against imperialism. The flames of anger have forced the brothers in Haiti and Venezuela to raise their hammers and smash the coups and coup plots orchestrated by American imperialism. The flames of anger have forced the brothers in Cuba to raise the banner of uprising, vowing to drive out the dictators who willingly serve as tools of American imperialism from their homeland.

Brothers of Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba, you should be proud of your glorious anti-aggression revolutionary traditions, which indicate that your future is shining with immense brilliance. Haiti, you, the land discovered by Columbus in 1492, your black brothers, under the leadership of the outstanding warrior Toussaint Louverture, began their heroic struggle for independence as early as 1790. In 1801, Napoleon's general Leclerc invited your leader Toussaint Louverture to attend a consultation meeting, but at the same time set a trap, arresting Toussaint at the meeting, putting him in shackles, and shipping him to France. Toussaint—such a hero worthy of the respect of people all over the world—was tortured to death in a French prison. As we review this period of history, we mourn Toussaint's sacrifice with righteous indignation, and even more remind you to be vigilant and never be deceived by the tricks of the colonialists. Although the aggressors' methods are vicious, it was Napoleon's tens of thousands of troops, not the people of Haiti, who failed in the historical torrent. Napoleon's invading army was completely annihilated, while the Haitian people established an independent black nation in 1803, setting an example for the complete success of the slave revolution, which at that time made slave owners all over the world tremble and shocked, and progressive people all over the world cheered.

Revolutionary brothers of Venezuela, we have not forgotten the heroic deeds of your historical revolutionary leader Francisco de Miranda, who led your ancestors in the revolutionary struggle for independence from 1810 to 1812, and was later unfortunately captured by the Spanish rulers and died miserably in prison. The same fate suffered by Miranda and Toussaint is enough to show that the faces of aggressors are hideous everywhere. This bloody lesson can only further encourage you and us to resist the courage of imperialist aggressors and war maniacs.

Revolutionary brothers of Cuba, we salute your repeated heroic uprisings against the Spanish rulers in history, and even more admire the unparalleled bravery shown by your national hero José Martí in the national independence war against the Spanish rulers in 1895. Your ancestors severely attacked the Spanish rulers in that war, but did not gain their own liberation, because soon after, the American imperialists openly launched an imperialist war, seized your territory from the Spanish and placed it under their control. Now, you have finally raised the banner of struggle and are advancing on the bloodstained footprints of revolutionary martyrs.

Revolutionary brothers of Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba, revolutionary brothers of all Latin America, your anti-imperialist struggle will surely achieve final victory. The solemn announcement of the Sino-Soviet leaders' meeting has further strengthened the confidence of you and us. If the imperialists overestimate their capabilities and dare to provoke and launch a war, peace-loving people all over the world will unite together and stand in the same ranks with you to completely eliminate imperialism!

    加勒比海岸的怒火
    ——寄语海地、委内瑞拉、古巴的革命弟兄
    黄绍湘
    中苏两个巨人发出响亮的号召：一定要保卫和平，制止侵略，对全世界任何地区发生的民族解放运动给予有力的支持！这号召响彻了全世界，也震撼了拉丁美洲的大地。遥想此时，在反帝斗争刚取得初步战果的英勇的海地人民、委内瑞拉人民和古巴人民，定会以兴奋的心情，迎接这个来自社会主义阵营的伟大的有力支援，而更充满信心地前进吧。
    位于加勒比海区的美丽的岛屿之上的海地、古巴，你们富庶的矿业资源和农业资源，在过去只给你们带来极大的不幸，招致了帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者贪婪的掠夺；蕴藏着丰富的石油和铁矿的委内瑞拉，提供了美国垄断资本家以巨大的利润，而带给你自己人民的只有贫穷和灾难。但是，帝国主义的掠夺和侵略只能激起被压迫的人民的反抗。在你们的大地上民族解放运动高涨，日益众多的爱国人民卷入反帝的神圣斗争里；愤怒的火焰迫使海地和委内瑞拉的弟兄，高举起铁锤，粉碎了美帝策划的政变和政变阴谋；愤怒的火焰迫使古巴的弟兄高举起义的旗帜，宣誓要把甘心作美帝国主义工具的独裁者赶出国土去。
    海地、委内瑞拉、古巴的弟兄们，你们应该以光荣的反侵略的革命传统自豪，它指出你们的前景正闪烁着万丈光芒。海地，你这在1492年就由哥仑布发现的大地，你的黑人弟兄们，在卓越的战士杜桑的领导下，从1790年就开始英勇地进行了争取独立的战斗。1801年拿破仑的将军黎克勒，邀请你们的领袖杜桑参加协商会议，但同时却布下了陷阱，在会议上把杜桑抓起来，戴上了镣铐，用船运往法国。杜桑——这样一位值得全世界人民敬仰的英雄，竟在法国监狱中被折磨死了。当我们温习这一段历史的时候，我们既悲悼杜桑的牺牲，义愤填胸，更要提醒你们提高警惕，永远不要受殖民主义者花招的迷惑。侵略者的手段虽然毒辣，但在历史巨浪中失败的却是拿破仑几万大军，而不是海地的人民。拿破仑侵略军全军复没了，而海地人民却在1803年建立了独立的黑人国家，为奴隶革命获得完全成功树立了榜样，当时曾使全世界的奴隶主战栗和震惊，全世界进步人民欢欣鼓舞。
    委内瑞拉的革命弟兄，我们也没有忘记你们历史上革命领袖佛兰西斯·米兰达的英雄事迹，他领导了你们的先人进行了1810—1812年争取独立的革命斗争，后来不幸被西班牙统治者所俘，惨死于狱中。米兰达和杜桑遭到的同一命运足以说明侵略者的面貌到处一样狰狞。这血腥的一课，只有更鼓起你们和我们反抗帝国主义侵略者、战争狂人的勇气。
    古巴的革命弟兄们，我们向你们历史上前仆后继的反抗西班牙统治者的多次英勇起义致敬，更钦佩你们的民族英雄何塞·马蒂在1895年反抗西班牙统治者的民族独立战争中所表现的无比的勇猛。你们的先人在那次战争中狠狠地打击了西班牙统治者，但并未获得自身解放，因为不多久，美帝国主义者就公然发动帝国主义战争，把你们的国土从西班牙人手中攫夺过来，置于它的魔掌的控制之下了。现在，你们终于高举起斗争的旗帜，踏上革命先烈的血迹前进了。
    海地、委内瑞拉、古巴的革命弟兄们，全拉丁美洲的革命弟兄们，你们的反帝斗争必将取得最后的胜利。中苏领袖会谈的庄严昭示，更加坚定了你们和我们的信心，如果帝国主义者不自量力，敢于挑衅，掀起战争，全世界爱好和平的人民，必将团结在一起，和你们站在同一行列，彻底地把帝国主义消灭掉！
