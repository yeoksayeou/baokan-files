Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, July 31st: China's first self-made 5,000-ton ocean freighter was fully completed at the Dalian Shipyard on the afternoon of the 30th, more than eight months ahead of schedule. The completion of this ocean freighter marks a leap forward in the technology of China's shipbuilding industry.

　　New shipbuilding technologies from around the world were adopted in the design and manufacturing of this ocean freighter. The main engine, auxiliary engine, generator, boiler, stern shaft, and other equipment on the ship were all self-made by domestic factories. The construction quality is very good. The ship is 115.5 meters long and 16 meters wide. The displacement at full load is 8,730 tons. The ship speed is 12.5 nautical miles per hour, and the main engine is 2,400 horsepower.

　　According to the national plan, this ocean freighter, which started construction on December 25th last year, was scheduled to be completed in April next year. However, the workers and staff launched a friendly competition with the workers and staff of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the production efficiency increased rapidly, finally completing it ahead of schedule on the 30th.

    第一艘五千吨海轮建成
    据新华社旅大31日电　我国自制的第一艘载重五千吨的海轮30日下午在大连造船厂全部完工，比计划提前八个多月。这艘海轮的建成，标志着我国造船工业的技术有了飞跃的发展。
    这艘海轮在设计和制造工作中，都采用了世界造船的新技术。船上的主机、辅机、发电机、锅炉、尾轴等，都是由国内工厂自制的。建造的质量都很好。船长一百一十五点五公尺，宽十六公尺。满载排水量为八千七百三十吨。船速每小时十二点五浬，主机为两千四百马力。
    按照国家计划，这艘在去年12月25日开工建造的海轮，要在明年4月才能建成，但是职工们和江南造船厂职工展开友谊竞赛，生产效率飞快提高，终于提前在30日建成。（附图片）
