Several homemade pesticides compiled by the Second Commercial Department:

　　Tobacco Stalks (i.e., tobacco stems, tobacco shells): To prevent rice borers, (1) chop one jin of tobacco stalks, add ten jin of water, boil for one hour, and filter. (2) Boil ten jin of tobacco stalks with ninety jin of water for two hours. Spray with the above original solution to kill insects, with an effectiveness of 80%-90%.
　　
　　*Yangjiaoniu* (羊角扭), *Da Cha Yao* (大茶药), *Wu Ye* (乌叶), *Jia Huang Pi* (假黄皮) (*Yangjiaoniu* is also known as *Huang Ge Niu* (黄葛扭)): Use a total of thirty jin of the above herbs, mix with one hundred jin of water, boil until the water turns yellow, pour into a wooden bucket, then add twelve jin of lime, filter after cooling, and spray. It has a good effect on controlling stem borers.
　　
　　Yellow Vine Root: Locally known as *Shui Ben Cao* (水苯草), *Duan Chang Cao* (断肠草). (1) Use ten jin of yellow vine root, add five jin of old insect flowers, three jin of tobacco stalks, and two jin of lime, mash, add one hundred and fifty jin of water, boil for four hours to make one hundred jin of yellow liquid, then add two jin of quicklime, filter, and add one *liang* of soap dissolved in water, and stir well.
　　(2) Mash the yellow vine root, add ten jin of water per jin, soak for five days, and filter to remove residue. (3) Peel off the bark of the yellow vine root, dry in the sun, grind into powder, and sift. (4) Soak the root bark in clean water for one day and remove the residue. Use about one *jin* of the powdered medicine per *mu*, put it in a thin cloth bag and shake it. Spray the liquid to prevent rice borers, cotton aphids, red spiders, and rice leaf beetles. The effect is 90%.
　　
　　Wild Konjac: Soak one *jin* of chopped wild konjac in one hundred *jin* of water. Pour and apply. To prevent rice borers, Huaxi County in Sichuan Province and Sinan County in Guizhou Province have never found missing seedlings or deadheart seedlings when using wild konjac.
　　
　　Garlic: Mash three *jin* of peeled garlic into a paste and soak it in one hundred *jin* of clean water for half an hour. Spray with a sprayer. After one or two sprays, rice blast is reduced by 30%-50%, which is better than using Bordeaux mixture.
　　
　　Six-Horned Thorn (i.e., Christmas tree): Peel off the bark of the six-horned thorn tree and mash it, wash away the residue in water, and the mucus floating on the surface of the water can be used. The method is to tie about forty wheat stalks into a bundle, pour the six-horned thorn mucus on it, and hang it around the moth-attracting lamp at night. Moths, rice planthoppers, etc. will be stuck.

　　The Yulin Special District Commercial Bureau in Guangxi has affirmed a very good homemade pesticide, with an insecticidal efficiency of 100%. The method is as follows:

　　Eucalyptus Leaf Mixture: First, take three *jin* of large eucalyptus leaves and two *jin* of small eucalyptus leaves, mash them, and put them into twenty-five *jin* of freshly boiled clean water, then boil for another twenty minutes, take out and filter to remove the residue, to obtain about twenty *jin* of medicinal water; then take three *liang* of ginger, mash it, and add clean water to extract four *liang* of juice. Then mash three *liang* of garlic and add clean water to extract four *liang* of juice (do not use the residue for either). Finally, cut one *liang* of soap into thin slices, dissolve it in boiling water into a paste, mix these things together, add three *qian* of broom leaf oil and mix well, then spray with a sprayer to kill insects.
　　
　　This medicine was tested in the rice paddies of the 22nd production team of Huancheng Agricultural Cooperative in Rong County (dense seedlings, about eight inches high). One and a half to two hours later, all the rice borers died, and other pests such as leafhoppers and rice planthoppers also died 70%.

　　土法制农药
    第二商业部综合的几种土药：
    烟秆（即烟茎、烟老壳）：防治稻螟，（1）用烟秆切碎，一斤加水十斤，熬一小时过滤。（2）用烟秆十斤加水九十斤熬二小时，用上述原液进行喷射杀虫，效果在80％—90％。
    羊角扭、大茶药、乌叶、假黄皮（羊角扭又名黄葛扭）：用上述草药共三十斤，兑水一百斤，煮到水变黄色后，倒入木桶内，再兑石灰十二斤，过滤后冷却，喷射。治三化螟效果良好。
    黄藤根：土名水苯草、断肠草，（一）用黄藤根十斤，加老虫花五斤，烟秆三斤，石灰二斤，捣碎加水一百五十斤，熬四小时，成黄色药液一百斤，再加生石灰二斤，滤后加肥皂一两溶化的水，搅匀。
  （二）把黄藤根捣碎，每斤加水十斤，浸五天，过滤去渣。（三）将黄藤根皮剥下晒干，磨成粉末，过筛。（四）将根皮浸在清水里，浸一天去渣。每亩用药粉一斤左右，装在稀布袋内抖撒。液剂进行喷射，可防治稻螟、棉蚜、红蜘蛛、稻铁甲虫。效果90％。
    野磨芋：用切碎的野磨芋一斤，泡水一百斤。进行泼施。防治稻螟，四川省花溪县、贵州省思南县用野磨芋防治从未发现缺苗及枯心苗。
    大蒜头：用去皮的蒜头三斤，捣烂成糊状放在一百斤清水中浸半小时，用喷雾器喷射。每喷一至二次后，稻热病降低30％——50％，比用波尔多液效果还好。
    六角刺（即圣诞树）：将六角刺树皮剥下捣烂，放在水里洗去残渣，浮在水面上的粘液即能使用。用法以麦秆约四十根束成把，把六角刺粘液浇上去，晚间挂在诱蛾灯四周，螟蛾、稻飞虱等飞来即粘住。
    广西玉林专区商业局肯定了一种很好的土农药，其杀虫效率达百分之百。制法是这样的：
    桉叶混合剂：先取大案树叶三斤、小案树叶二斤，捣碎后，投入刚煮沸的二十五斤清水内，再煮二十分钟，取出过滤去渣，约得药水二十斤；然后取生姜三两捣烂，加清水榨出汁四两。再将大蒜三两捣烂，加清水榨汁四两（两样都不要渣）；最后，取肥皂一两切成薄片，用沸水溶解如糊状，把这几种东西混在一起，并加扫把叶油三钱拌匀，即可用喷雾器喷射杀虫。
    这药剂曾在容县环城农业社二十二生产队的秧田试用（秧密，高度约八寸），一个半到两个小时以后，螟虫全部死亡，其他害虫如浮尘子、稻飞虱也死去70％。
