Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. The Liuxi River Hydropower Station, currently the largest in Guangdong Province, held its ribbon-cutting ceremony for power generation on the morning of the 15th. According to the original plan, this hydropower station was not scheduled to begin generating electricity until the end of this year.

The installed capacity of this first medium-sized hydropower station in Guangdong Province is 42,000 kilowatts, and it can generate 150 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, equivalent to the total power generation of Guangzhou City in 1957.

The completion of this hydropower station can not only supply a large amount of cheap power to Guangzhou and Conghua areas, fundamentally improving the power shortage situation in Guangzhou City, but also the water storage can irrigate 274,000 mu of paddy fields and ensure that 300,000 mu of farmland downstream will not be flooded in the event of a flood that occurs once every twenty years. The artificial reservoir can also be used for fish farming, generating a profit of 100,000 yuan per year.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. Yunnan Province is currently building four railways. The southern section of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, which is currently under construction, is an important thoroughfare for Yunnan Province to connect with other provinces. The Zhanyi-Rongfeng section is now under full construction; the Rongfeng-Weining section is undergoing key construction while surveying and designing are carried out simultaneously. The other three railways under construction will connect several major industrial areas in the province. As of July, the Kunming-Yipinglang Railway, from Kunming to Yipinglang, a major coking coal production area in Yunnan, had completed more than 360,000 cubic meters of earthwork, of which the subgrade and bridge culverts of a 75-kilometer section have been basically completed. The Caoba-Baishachong line from Caoba on the Kunming-Hekou Railway to the Baishachong mining area of the Gejiu Tin Mine, and the Dongchuan branch line of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, also started construction successively before the beginning of August.

These four railways mostly meander through lofty mountains and high ridges, especially the southern section of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, which has to cross the Jinsha River and pass through the high mountains and deep valleys on the edge of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces, making the project extremely complex and arduous. The railway soldiers and officers responsible for the construction of these railways, as well as the employees of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and nearly 100,000 civilian workers from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, are all fighting against the high mountains and stubborn rocks with soaring enthusiasm. The soldiers said proudly: "The Red Army of the ancestors were heroes, and we descendants are brave men. Heroes are not afraid of the hardship of the Long March, and brave men are not afraid of the difficulty of building roads." (Attached picture)

### 流溪河电站落成　广州电量加一番　云南省修建铁路　丛山峻岭只等闲

　　流溪河电站落成　广州电量加一番
　　云南省修建铁路　丛山峻岭只等闲
    据新华社广州电　广东省目前最大的水力发电站——流溪河水电站，15日上午举行发电剪彩典礼。按原计划，这个水电站要到今年年底才开始发电。
    这座广东省的第一个中型水电站的装机容量是四万二千瓩，每年能发出一亿五千万度电，相当于1957年广州市的总发电量。
    这个水电站的建成，不仅可以供应广州及从化地区大量廉价的动力，根本改善广州市电力不足的状况；蓄水还可以灌溉稻田二十七万四千亩，并保证下游三十万亩农田在二十年一遇的洪水时不致成灾。人造水库还可以养鱼，每年能获利十万元。
    据新华社昆明电　云南省正在修建四条铁路。目前正在加紧修筑的内（江）昆（明）铁路南段，是云南省通往省外的重要干道。现在沾益至榕峰段已经全面施工；榕峰至威宁段在边测量边设计的同时，已开始重点施工。正在修筑的其它三条铁路将把省内几个主要工业区联结起来。从昆明到云南主要焦煤产区一平浪的昆一铁路，到7月份止已完成三十六万多土石方工程，其中有七十五公里一段的路基和桥涵已基本完工。从昆（明）河（口）铁路上的草坝起到个旧锡矿白沙冲矿区的草白线和内昆铁路的东川支线，也在8月上旬以前先后动工。
    这四条铁路大都蜿蜒在丛山峻岭之间，特别是内昆铁路南段要跨过金沙江，穿过云、贵、川三省边缘地带的高山深谷，工程十分复杂艰巨。担负这些铁路建设任务的铁道兵官兵和铁道部第二工程局的职工以及四川、云南两省近十万民工，都以冲天的干劲向高山顽石展开搏斗。战士们自豪地说：“先辈红军是英雄，后代我们是好汉，英雄不怕远征苦，好汉不怕修路难。”（附图片）
