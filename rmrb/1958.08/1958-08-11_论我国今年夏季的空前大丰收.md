　　On the Unprecedented Bumper Harvest in China This Summer
　　Tan Zhenlin
　　This year's summer bumper harvest is an extremely encouraging and great victory on China's agricultural production front.

　　Following the bumper harvest of rapeseed, the total output of summer grain crops, mainly wheat, reached 101 billion jin, an increase of 41.3 billion jin over 1957; early rice and spring wheat will also increase by more than 40 billion jin compared with 1957. The total summer grain crops will increase by more than 80 billion jin compared with last year. This means that the increase in grain production this summer alone exceeded the total annual increase in grain production during the First Five-Year Plan period. At present, autumn crops—grain, cotton, oilseeds, etc.—are growing well, and farmers everywhere are full of energy. As long as we continue to vigorously grasp every aspect of field management, especially tool reform, to ensure that various yield-increasing measures keep up in time, and overcome the threats of drought and floods during the flood season, it is entirely certain that we will achieve an even greater harvest in the autumn than in the summer with two more months of effort.

　　This victory has brought about a fundamental change in China's agricultural production front. This change has profound significance not only economically but also politically.

　　This victory demonstrates that China's grain production is developing at a speed unprecedented in history; our people are rapidly realizing their desire for food and clothing and moving towards a better life. As of the end of June, the growth rate of summer grain in the country reached 69%, with provinces such as Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Beijing increasing production by one to two times. According to incomplete statistics, two counties have emerged with an average wheat yield of over 600 jin per mu, ten counties have emerged with an average yield of over 500 jin per mu, and there are batches of "thousand-jin communes". The area with a yield of over 500 jin per mu has reached over ten million mu, of which the area with a yield of over 1,000 jin has increased from over 800 mu last year to over one million mu. Good news of bumper early rice harvests is also flying in from all over the country. Based on existing materials alone, dozens of early rice "thousand-jin counties" will emerge, while only eight counties achieved this for rice in the entire last year. The summer harvest proves that the speed of grain production increase in China can not only be a few tens of percent, but can also double. This year's summer crops were innately insufficient, mainly relying on later management, which achieved such a harvest. Autumn crops were grasped very tightly from the beginning. In particular, the summer harvest has greatly liberated people's minds, and there is every reason to be certain of achieving a greater harvest in the autumn crops. A greater leap forward in agricultural production in China in the next two years is also foreseeable. This summer alone has increased the average grain per person by more than 120 jin for the more than 600 million people in the country. After the autumn harvest, the national average grain ownership per person will be 800 to 1,000 jin, and some provinces may reach more than 1,000 jin. Within three to five years, the people of the whole country will have sufficient rations, sufficient feed, sufficient industrial grain, and sufficient reserve grain. The day is not far off when the average consumption of grain, meat, oil, sugar, and cloth per capita in China will catch up with the highest production levels of the capitalist countries in the world.

　　This victory has promoted and will more rapidly promote the development of China's entire economic and cultural construction. The development of agriculture provides sufficient raw materials and a huge market for light industry. Light industry must develop rapidly to digest the raw materials provided by agriculture and meet the rapidly growing needs of the people. The development of agriculture and light industry has accumulated strong capital and opened up a vast market for the rapid development of heavy industry, so that heavy industry must also develop at the fastest speed to meet the requirements of agriculture and light industry; the rapid development of heavy industry will provide more favorable conditions for the high-speed development of agriculture and light industry. It is the foundation of agricultural mechanization and electrification, and the foundation of the modernization of light industry. Undoubtedly, the high-speed development of agriculture in China will greatly accelerate the speed of industrialization and the rapid development of our cultural undertakings. The general line of socialist construction stipulated by the Party, which emphasizes the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture under the priority development of heavy industry, correctly reflects the objective laws of socialist construction in China. More and more people see this law more clearly.

　　This victory has further liberated people's minds and refuted all arguments that China's agricultural production cannot grow rapidly. The summer harvest, the large-scale doubling of production, especially the launching of wheat "satellites" with yields of 6,000 to 7,000 jin per mu, has broken many outdated views of the past. In the past, people thought that wheat was a low-yield crop, but now it has been proven wrong. Since wheat can change from low-yield to high-yield, why can't other crops be high-yield? In the past, people thought that areas with poor natural conditions could not increase production. Now it has been proven that natural conditions can be changed quickly. The areas with large-scale bumper harvests this summer not only appeared in plains and areas with good natural conditions, but also in mountainous areas and areas with poor natural conditions. In the past, people thought that rapid production increases were impossible without tractors and chemical fertilizers. Now it has been proven that even without a large supply of tractors and chemical fertilizers, relying mainly on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, relying on "local" methods such as water conservancy, fertilizer, soil improvement, promotion of improved varieties, rational close planting, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, field management, and tool reform, rapid and large-scale production increases can be achieved. As the masses themselves say, "There are no low-yield crops, only low-yield thinking." Existence determines consciousness. The summer harvest is an objective existence, which further improves people's understanding of nature and promotes the development of agricultural science. Facts have proven that all retreatists and wait-and-see elements are wrong, and all those who insist on the pessimistic view and conditional view of agricultural production are wrong. After a series of struggles, in the face of the lessons of facts, many of them have admitted defeat, and many have begun to unite around the Party's general line on the new basis of the Great Leap Forward. Individual households that have not joined the cooperative are clamoring to join, and many of the previously cynical wealthy middle peasants in the cooperative have also expressed their heartfelt admiration. More and more people firmly support socialism, and more and more people are eagerly pursuing Marxism. The red flag of the proletariat is being raised higher and higher in our country.

　　The great victory we have achieved on the agricultural production front is by no means accidental.

　　Some people attribute the summer harvest to this year's natural conditions, saying it is due to "favorable weather." Is this really the case? Please check the history of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. Which year's favorable weather could have caused the summer grain crops of over 530 million mu to increase by 69% compared with the previous year? Could it have produced wheat with a yield of 7,320 jin per mu? Which year could have caused the early rice of over 150 million mu to increase by 100% compared with the previous year? Could it have produced early rice with a yield of over 16,000 jin per mu? In fact, this year's natural conditions in our country were not very conducive to crop growth. Both the north and the south, many areas have suffered from varying degrees of disaster, especially most areas encountered severe drought when sowing wheat. When it was growing, some areas were still severely drought-stricken, some areas encountered continuous rain, and some areas suffered from hail, frost, plant diseases, insect pests, and wind disasters. It was only after a tenacious struggle and overcoming these disasters that an unprecedented harvest was achieved. Taking Hebei as an example, the province only had 150 millimeters of rain during the rainy season last year, and there was no thorough rain in the nine months from sowing to harvest. However, after a series of efforts, the summer grain production in Hebei Province increased by 77%. Doesn't this fact prove that the "favorable weather" theory is untenable? From last winter to the end of June this year, the country expanded the irrigated area by 425 million mu, accumulated over 640 billion dan of fertilizer, deep-plowed over 128 million mu of land, widely promoted improved varieties, strengthened field management, eliminated third-class seedlings in many areas, and carried out tool reforms. These are the real material foundations for the summer bumper harvest. Since last winter, farmers and rural work cadres across the country have been marching towards nature day and night. They proposed slogans such as "A few years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness," "Let the river make way, and let the high mountains bow their heads," and "The cold weather cannot freeze the determination, and the high mountains cannot exceed the heart," saving food and clothing, opening mountains and breaking ridges, and carrying out large-scale farmland capital construction. They "turned winter leisure into winter busy," "treated the black night as the day, and the moon as the sun," "red flags during the day, and red lights at night," "everyone has work to do, and every household has no idle people," and men, women, old and young all plunged into intense labor. They visited, compared, and learned from each other, learned advanced experiences, dared to think and dared to do, "how bold people are, how much land can produce," "bold hearts, nothing to fear, small hearts, nothing can be done," broke old rules and regulations, and overcame difficulties in the process of advancement. They competed openly and secretly, striving to be the best, catching up with the advanced, everyone striving bravely, everyone taking the lead, taking being advanced as an honor, and being backward as a shame. They treated crops like loving mothers nurturing babies, caring for them and protecting them, from plowing to sowing, from sowing to green, from green to yellow, from yellow to the field, from the field to the warehouse, every link went through hard struggles and paid huge labor. In order to strive for a bumper harvest, they broke the boundaries of communes, townships, and counties, implemented socialist large-scale cooperation, supported each other, and leaped forward together. The enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses fully exerted under the leadership of the Party is the true source of power for the summer bumper harvest. Those who advocate the "favorable weather" theory do not see or are unwilling to see these, and attribute the summer harvest to accidental factors, which is completely wrong.

　　What do the farmers themselves think about this issue? They said, "The wheat is golden, the field is full and the warehouse is full. Where does the bumper harvest come from? All depends on the Communist Party. Overcome plant diseases and insect pests, defeat the old dragon king, work hard for three hundred days, and turn strength into grain." This allegro poem is precisely an extremely vivid and objectively realistic conclusion that the farmers themselves have made about this year's summer harvest.

　　The decisive factor for the summer bumper harvest is first of all the leadership of the Party, political command; first of all the human factor rather than the material factor. This is extremely obvious. Without the whole people's rectification movement, without the anti-Rightist struggle, without the socialist education movement in the countryside, the summer harvest would not have been possible. The political preparation and ideological preparation for this year's summer bumper harvest actually started from February last year. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." In June, Comrade Zhou Enlai, in his government work report at the National People's Congress, severely criticized the mistake of opposing "rash advance" and clearly affirmed that 1956 was a leap forward rather than a "rash advance." This report gave the bourgeois Rightists a severe blow. In September, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his report on the rectification movement at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, clearly pointed out that to realize the National Agricultural Development Program, there must be a burst of energy, and it is necessary to constantly struggle against conservative tendencies. This spring, Comrade Mao Zedong presided over the Nanning Conference and the Chengdu Conference, thoroughly criticized the mistake of opposing "rash advance," put forward the fighting call of "hard struggle for three years to fundamentally change the face of our country in most areas," and put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and many working methods suitable for the current situation, greatly liberating people's minds and encouraging the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, laying a solid ideological foundation for the all-round Great Leap Forward. At the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in the Central Committee's work report, systematically summarized the experiences and lessons of socialist construction in our country, systematically expounded the general line of socialist construction, making the whole Party and the people of the whole country more clearly define their direction of struggle and move forward with confidence.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that drawing the line between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and correctly handling contradictions among the people, is to "unite the people of all nationalities across the country to conduct a new war—to wage war against nature, develop our economy, develop our culture, so that all the people can smoothly pass through the current transition period, consolidate our new system, and build our new country." Since last year, China's whole people's rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, the socialist education movement in the countryside, and the propaganda movement of the general line, etc., have been carried out in accordance with the guidelines, policies, and methods instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong in this report.

　　At this time last year, the bourgeois Rightists launched a frenzied attack on us, attempting to restore capitalism. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country gave these guys a fatal blow. After the anti-Rightist struggle, they were completely isolated, they were completely discredited, and the pressure they put on the people was crushed. Without this struggle, without drawing this line between ourselves and the enemy among the people, it would not have been possible to achieve the summer harvest.

　　While struggling against the bourgeois Rightists outside the Party, we also waged a resolute struggle against the bourgeois Rightists and revisionists within the Party. These people hidden within the Party, such as Sha Wenhan and Yang Si of Zhejiang, and Li Shinong of Anhui, etc., colluded with the Rightists outside the Party to carry out activities against the Party. If these people are not eliminated, our cause will suffer serious harm. At the same time, we have also waged irreconcilable struggles against some localist elements, nationalist elements, Right-leaning opportunist elements, and elements who make separatist attempts against the Party within the Party. These people have serious bourgeois individualism. They oppose the correct general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Experience has proven that wherever these people are in power, things there are cold and desolate, and stagnant. Wherever these people are exposed and not allowed to issue orders, things there are done vigorously and leaping forward. The all-round leap forward in China's socialist construction is precisely the result of pulling out these white flags of the bourgeoisie and inserting the revolutionary red flags of the proletariat.

　　The rectification movement carried out in accordance with the principles instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong in government offices, troops, schools, organizations, factories, and rural areas has achieved remarkable results. Using methods such as great airing of views, great debates, big-character posters, and exhibitions, a wave of rectification and reform was launched among the entire people. An agricultural cooperative posted tens of thousands of big-character posters, exposing contradictions from all aspects. The content was satisfactory, and the forms were rich and colorful. There were criticisms, self-criticisms, praises, songs, texts, cartoons, poems, and allegro. The power of the big-character posters not only discredited the capitalist road of the wealthy middle peasants, but also straightened the "three styles" of the cadres, eliminated the "five airs" among them, and resolved various disputes between cooperative members and families. To air views on what is being done, and debate what is being debated has become a new method that is widely welcomed by cadres and the masses. The visualized physical object exhibition has become a powerful weapon for cadres and the masses to educate themselves. The mass line of fully mobilizing the masses' consciousness and initiative has replaced the non-mass line of simply forcing orders from top to bottom; persuasion has replaced coercion. Of course, there are still some places that do not know how to follow the mass line, these places still need to continue to implement the rectification movement. However, from a national perspective, after rectification and reform, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly improved, the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly increased, and the heroic spirit of stubbornly overcoming difficulties and the communist spirit of consciously cooperating with each other are developing vigorously among the people.

　　The rectification movement greatly improved the Party's Marxist level, strengthened the Party's leadership over agricultural production, creatively developed the Party's mass line, and powerfully guaranteed the political command from the organizational level. The Hong'an County Party Committee, in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions that cadres must participate in production and lead production, pioneered the leadership method of experimental plots, which has been widely promoted. This is a Marxist leadership method, a leadership method that conforms to Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of practice. It enables the leading organs to more closely connect with reality and connect with the masses under the new situation, enabling our cadres to further grasp the laws of agricultural production, further grasp the pulse of the masses, and improve the level of leadership and improve the style of leadership from practice. Senior responsible comrades of the Party and the government also actively responded to Comrade Mao Zedong's call, walked out of the office, went deep into the scene, personally discovered problems, summed up experience, and created a series of lively, both good and fast working methods such as on-site meetings, inspection and evaluation, and grasping both ends to bring the middle along. Because leading cadres went deep among the masses and were in close contact with the masses, they greatly improved their sensitivity to new things, discovered problems in a timely manner according to the development of the situation, overcame shortcomings in a timely manner, and timely proposed new tasks, making the production upsurge closely linked one after another, one wave higher than another. After rectification, the party organizations at all levels greatly improved the Party Committee system, gave full play to the power of the Party's collective leadership, "strengthened the front line, twisted into a rope," and made all work centered on production, combined with each other, and leap forward in an all-round way. Most of the Party's cadres took the lead in the movement, set an example, not only became red, but also became specialized, began to change from laymen to experts, and gained the masses' unparalleled trust. The masses called their cadres good cadres of Chairman Mao and praised them as "Zhuge Liang" who are good at defeating the enemy. Due to the Party's strengthened leadership over agricultural production, not only has the leadership method and leadership style been improved, and a large number of new backbones have been trained, but we have also found a set of new laws for the rapid development of agricultural production in our country under the current conditions, that is, the eight yield-increasing measures based on water conservancy construction. This is of great significance for further ensuring the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in our country.

　　The whole people's rectification movement and the propaganda of the general line have laid a good ideological foundation for this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. The anti-Rightist struggle relatively thoroughly solved the problem of the two roads on the political and ideological fronts. However, the capitalist ideology still exists in the minds of some people for a relatively long time. Therefore, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism is still a relatively long-term struggle in the ideological field. The whole people's rectification movement and the propaganda of the general line have promoted the great liberation of thought and promoted the summer's bumper harvest. The summer bumper harvest has once again powerfully struck down right-leaning conservative thought and proven the correctness of the Party's general line of socialist construction. However, the contradiction and struggle between the advanced and the backward will always exist. The struggle between the two opposing working methods of the mass line and the anti-mass line will also exist for a long time. In order to continuously promote the socialist construction of our country, it is necessary to adhere to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it is necessary to adhere to the policy of political command. Political and ideological work is the soul of all work; correctly handling contradictions among the people is the driving force for the advancement of our cause, and it is the weapon to carry forward the advanced and overcome the backward, that is, the general policy of political and ideological work. Constantly and regularly grasping political and ideological work can enable Marxism to be "densely planted" in people's minds, achieve a great ideological harvest, continuously pull out the white flags of the bourgeoisie, and insert the red flags of the proletariat, so that our cause can advance from victory to victory.

　　That Marxism can produce grain is incomprehensible to those who are idealists and mechanical materialists, but it is a completely logical phenomenon for those who think in accordance with dialectical materialism. Marxists believe that the people are the creators of history, and all material and spiritual wealth of mankind is created by the working people. Correctly handling contradictions among the people fully gives play to the initiative of the people and can create a brand new situation in history. As early as last summer, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that through correctly handling contradictions among the people, it is necessary to create in our country a "political situation that has both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and personal ease of mind, liveliness and vigor." Over the past year, China's political situation has been developing in the direction pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. This political situation has been constantly developed and consolidated in the struggle of constantly discovering and resolving contradictions, and in the process of constantly and correctly handling contradictions among the people. The unprecedented summer bumper harvest, the continuous emergence of miracles in industry, agriculture, culture, and science, and the situation of an all-round leap forward in socialist construction have been produced under the premise of the continuous development and consolidation of such a political situation. The continued development of this situation will be an extremely important guarantee for realizing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　All true science develops with the development of practice. The reason why Marxism-Leninism has invincible power is that it respects practice and respects objective laws. Comrade Mao Zedong's views on correctly handling contradictions among the people, on changing working methods to adapt to changes in the situation, and the Party's general line of socialist construction put forward by him, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, greatly liberated the thinking of the Chinese people, and brought forth endless power. This is a brilliant example of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of socialist construction in China. All "wait-and-see" factions, "score-settling" factions, and skeptics, who do not respect Marxism-Leninism, do not respect practice, and only see things and not people, are destined to fail.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly grasped the laws of historical development in our country, and as early as the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in 1950, he put forward the slogan of three years of preparation and ten years of construction to build our country into a modern socialist country. At the beginning of this year, he also put forward the call to "struggle hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of our country in most areas." In the winter of 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong said in a comment on an article entitled "Mobilizing Women to Participate in Production Solved the Difficulty of Insufficient Labor Force": "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, several times, dozens of times, or even dozens of times higher than the current high yields of crops. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange undertakings is even more unimaginable by predecessors. The same is true for undertakings such as science, culture, education, and health." The development of socialist construction in our country has fully proven and will continue to prove the correctness and accuracy of Comrade Mao Zedong's predictions. Isn't the current situation developing according to Comrade Mao Zedong's estimates?

　　In June this year, when Comrade Mao Zedong met with the head of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative, he described a picture of a happy life to the people present, that is, he put forward a specific goal of struggle for us: an average of 1,500 jin of grain, 100 jin of pork, 20 jin of vegetable oil, and 20 jin of ginned cotton per person per year nationwide. We can say with full confidence that such a happy life is not too far away, and it is entirely possible to reach and exceed this goal in a short period of time. Comrade Mao Zedong once said that we should gradually and orderly form "industry (industry), agriculture (agriculture), commerce (exchange), learning (culture and education), and military (militia, that is, arming the whole people)" into a large commune, thereby constituting the basic unit of our society. At present, some places have begun to adopt the policy of merging large communes in order to meet the objective requirements of the Great Leap Forward, which has been developed in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology. Some agricultural cooperatives, after merging, have already bought tractors, automobiles, and new agricultural implements; they have already set up factories, power stations, radio stations, middle schools, hospitals, clubs, canteens, etc.; and the leading bodies of some agricultural communes have already begun to add specialized departments such as industry, transportation, water conservancy, technology, culture, and health. Especially in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly high, and a contingent of socialist construction activists who are both red and specialized has begun to form everywhere. They are not only the backbone in implementing the Party's general line and building socialism, but they will also play a backbone role in guiding 500 million farmers to gradually move from simple physical labor to a higher communist era that combines physical and mental labor. These new people and new things are emerging under the light of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, and they represent the great desire of 500 million farmers to rapidly build our country into socialism and advance towards communism.

　　At present, American and British imperialism is rampant in the Middle East. Their piratical acts have aroused the anger of the people all over the world and made them more politically isolated. They believe that they have the upper hand economically, holding steel in one hand and wheat in the other, running rampant in the world. But "the setting sun is infinitely good, only near dusk." The good days of imperialism are getting fewer and fewer. The great victory on the agricultural production front in our country fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system, greatly strengthens the strength of the socialist camp, and greatly benefits the cause of defending world peace. This year, the total wheat output of our country has already overwhelmed the United States, and the Soviet Union has also surpassed it in many aspects. It will not take long for the economic power of the socialist camp to leave imperialism far behind. The socialist system will more powerfully prove its unparalleled superiority to the world. Imperialism is there every day hoping that there will be famine in our country so that they can take advantage of the crisis. The Yugoslav revisionists, who are living on US aid, are also waving flags and shouting slogans next to them,丑化的社会主义制度。The great victory of agricultural production in our country has made these guys laugh and cry, and they are very embarrassed. Let all imperialists and revisionists babble in their dead ends, the Chinese people have taken their big steps and will firmly move towards the happy and beautiful communist era.

　　论我国今年夏季的空前大丰收
　　谭震林
    今年的夏季大丰收，是我国在农业生产战线上的一个极其振奋人心的伟大胜利。
    继油菜大丰收之后，以小麦为主的夏粮作物总产量达一千零一十亿斤，比1957年增产四百一十三亿斤；早稻和春小麦，也将比1957年增产四百亿斤以上。全部夏粮作物将比去年增产八百多亿斤。这就是说，今年一个夏季增产的粮食就超过了第一个五年计划期间各年粮食递增的总和。目前，秋季作物——粮食、棉花、油料等生长良好，各地农民干劲十足，只要我们继续大力抓紧田间管理的每一个环节，特别是抓紧工具改革，以保证各项增产措施及时跟上去，并战胜干旱和汛期的洪涝威胁，再经过两个月的努力，秋季比夏季获得更大的丰收，是完全可以肯定的。
    这个胜利，使我国农业生产战线发生了一个根本的变化。这个变化不仅在经济上，而且在政治上都有着深远的意义。
    这个胜利展示了，我国粮食生产正在以古今中外没有过的高速度向前发展；我国人民正在迅速地实现丰衣足食的愿望，向着更美好的生活迈进。截至6月底止，今年全国夏粮的增长率达69％，河南、浙江、江西、广东等省及北京市增产一倍到两倍以上。据不完全的统计，小麦平均亩产六百斤以上的已出现了两个县，平均亩产五百斤以上的已出现了十个县，并出现了成批的千斤社，亩产五百斤以上的已达千万亩以上，其中亩产千斤以上的已由去年的八百多亩增到一百多万亩。早稻丰收的捷报，也从全国各地飞来。仅现有材料，就将出现几十个早稻千斤县，而去年全年水稻千斤县只有八个。夏季丰收证明，我国粮食增产速度不仅可以是百分之十几、百分之几十，而且可以是成倍地增长。今年夏季作物先天不足，主要依靠了后期管理，即取得了这样的丰收，秋季作物一开始就抓得很紧，特别是夏季丰收大大解放了人们的思想，争取秋季作物更大的丰收，是有充分理由可以肯定的。明后两年我国农业生产的更大跃进，也是可以预计到的。今年一个夏季就为全国六亿多人民每人平均增加了一百二十多斤粮食，到秋收以后，全国按人口平均每人将拥有粮食八百斤到一千斤，有一部分省可能达到一千斤以上。在三年至五年内，全国人民将有足够的口粮、足够的饲料，足够的工业用粮和足够的储备粮。我国人民在粮食、肉类、油脂、食糖、布匹等按人口平均的消费方面，赶上世界上生产水平最高的资本主义国家，已为期不远了。
    这个胜利，已经推动了并还将更迅速地推动着我国整个经济、文化建设事业的发展。农业的发展为轻工业提供了充足的原料和巨大的市场，轻工业必须迅速发展才能消化农业提供的原料和满足人民迅速增长的需要；农业和轻工业的发展，又为重工业的迅速发展积累了雄厚的资金和开辟了广阔的市场，使重工业也必须以最快的速度发展，才能适应农业和轻工业的要求；重工业的迅速发展，又将替农业和轻工业的高速度发展提供更有利的条件。它是农业机械化、电气化的基础，是轻工业现代化的基础。无疑地，我国农业的高速度发展，必将大大加快我国工业化的速度和我国文化事业的迅速发展。党的社会主义建设总路线所规定的在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举的方针，正是正确地反映了我国社会主义建设的客观规律。这个规律，愈来愈多的人看得更清楚了。
    这个胜利，进一步解放了人们的思想，驳倒了我国农业生产不能迅速增长的一切论调。夏季丰收，大面积的成倍的增产，特别是亩产六、七千斤的小麦“卫星”上天，把过去许多陈腐的观点打破了。过去人们认为，小麦是低产作物，现在证明不对了。小麦既然能够由低产变为高产，其他作物为什么不能高产呢？过去人们认为，自然条件不好的地方不能增产，现在证明自然条件是可以迅速改变的，今年夏季大面积丰收的地区，不仅出现在平原地区，自然条件好的地区，而且出现在山区、自然条件不好的地区。过去人们认为，没有拖拉机、没有化肥不可能迅速增产，现在证明，即使还没有大量的拖拉机和化肥的供应，主要依靠群众的积极性、创造性，依靠水利、肥料、土壤改良、推广良种、合理密植、防治病虫害、田间管理和工具改革等项“土”办法，也可以迅速地大量地增产。正如群众自己所说：“没有低产作物，只有低产思想”。存在决定意识，夏季丰收是个客观存在，它进一步地提高了人们对自然界的认识，促进了农业科学的发展。事实已经证明，一切促退派、观潮派是错了，一切坚持农业生产的悲观论、条件论的人们是错了。经过一系列的斗争，在事实的教训面前，他们当中已经有不少人认输了，不少人开始在大跃进的新的基础上团结到党的总路线的周围来了。未入社的单干户纷纷要求入社，许多原来在社内说风凉话的富裕中农也表示口服心服了。坚决拥护社会主义的人愈来愈多，热烈追求马克思主义的人愈来愈多，无产阶级的革命红旗，在我国举得愈来愈高了。
    我们在农业生产战线上获得这样的伟大胜利，绝不是偶然的。
    有人把夏季丰收归功于今年的自然条件，说是由于“风调雨顺”。难道事情真是这样吗？请查一查古今中外的历史，有那一个年头的风调雨顺能够使五亿三千多万亩夏粮作物比上年度增产69％？能够出现亩产七千三百二十斤的小麦？有那一个年头能够使一亿五千多万亩早稻比上年度增产百分之一百？能够出现亩产一万六千多斤的早稻？事实上，今年我国的自然条件并不是十分有利于农作物生长的。无论北方和南方，不少地区都遭受过不同程度的灾害侵袭，特别是绝大部分地区的小麦播种时碰到严重的干旱。正生长的时候，有的地区干旱仍然严重，有的地区碰到连绵霪雨，有的地区遭受了雹灾、霜冻、病虫害和风灾的袭击。经过了顽强的斗争，战胜了这些灾害，才获得了空前的丰收。以河北为例，该省去年雨季只下了一百五十公厘雨，从播种到收获，九个月当中未下过透雨。但是经过一系列的努力，河北全省的夏粮增产了77％。这样的事实不正是证明“风调雨顺”论者站不住脚吗？从去年冬天到今年6月底，全国扩大灌溉面积四亿二千五百万亩，积肥六千四百多亿担，深翻土地一亿二千八百多万亩，普遍推广了优良品种，加强了田间管理，许多地区消灭了三类苗，进行了工具改革，这些才真正是夏季大丰收的物质基础。去冬以来，全国农民和农村工作干部夜以继日地向自然进军。他们提出：“几年辛苦，万年幸福”，
  “叫河水让路，要高山低头”，“天冻冻不了决心，山高高不过脚心”等口号，节衣缩食，开山辟岭，大搞农田基本建设。他们“变冬闲为冬忙”，“黑夜当白天，月亮当太阳”，“白天一片红旗，晚上一片红灯”，“人人有活做，户户无闲人”，男女老少都投入了紧张的劳动。他们互相参观、评比，互相学习先进经验，敢想、敢作，“人有多大胆，地有多大产”，“心大胆大，什么也不怕，心小胆小，什么也干不了”，打破了清规戒律，克服了前进中的困难。他们明比暗赛，力争上游，追先进，赶先进，人人奋勇，个个当先，以先进为荣，以落后为耻。他们对待作物，有如慈母抚育婴儿，爱护她，保卫她，从耕到播，从播到青，从青到黄，从黄到场，从场到仓，每一个环节都经过了艰苦的斗争，付出了巨大的劳动。他们为了争取丰收，打破社界、乡界、县界，实行社会主义大协作，互相支援，共同跃进。广大群众在党的领导下充分发挥起来的这种积极性、创造性，才真正是夏季大丰收的力量的源泉。“风调雨顺”论者看不见或不愿意看见这些，而把夏季丰收归之于偶然性的因素，是完全不对的。
    农民自己对这个问题怎么看呢？他们说：“小麦金黄黄，满场又满仓，丰收那里来，全靠共产党。战胜病虫害，斗倒老龙王，苦干三百天，力气变成粮。”这首快板诗，正是农民自己对今年夏季丰收所下的一个极其生动而又符合客观实际的结论。
    夏季大丰收决定性的因素，首先是党的领导，是政治挂帅；首先是人的因素而不是物的因素。这是异常明显的。没有全民整风运动，没有反右派斗争，没有农村的社会主义教育运动，夏季丰收是不可能的。今年夏季大丰收的政治准备和思想准备，实际上从去年2月就开始了。那时，毛泽东同志作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告。6月，周恩来同志在人大的政府工作报告中，严肃地批判了反“冒进”的错误，明确肯定1956年是跃进而不是什么“冒进”，这个报告给了资产阶级右派分子以狠狠的打击。9月，邓小平同志在党的三中全会上所作的关于整风运动的报告中，明确指出，要实现全国农业发展纲要，必须有一股劲，必须经常同保守倾向作斗争。今年春天，毛泽东同志主持了南宁会议和成都会议，彻底批判了反“冒进”的错误，提出了“苦战三年，在绝大部分地区基本上改变我国面貌”的战斗号召，提出了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线和许多适合当前形势的工作方法，大大地解放了人们的思想，鼓舞了人们敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，为全面大跃进打下了巩固的思想基础。党的八大二次会议上，刘少奇同志在中央的工作报告中，把我国社会主义建设的经验教训作了系统的总结，对社会主义建设的总路线作了系统的阐明，使全党和全国人民更加明确了自己的斗争方向而信心百倍地奋勇向前。
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中指出，划分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的界线，正确处理人民内部矛盾，是为了“团结全国各族人民进行一场新的战争——向自然界开战，发展我们的经济，发展我们的文化，使全体人民比较顺利地走过目前的过渡时期，巩固我们的新制度，建设我们的新国家”。去年以来，我国的全民整风、反右派斗争、农村的社会主义教育运动和总路线的宣传运动等，正是按照毛泽东同志在这个报告中指示的方针、政策和方法去进行的。
    去年这时，资产阶级右派分子向我们举行了猖狂的进攻，企图复辟。全国人民在党的领导下给了这些家伙以致命的打击。经过反右派斗争，他们被彻底孤立了，他们被整臭了，他们给人民的压力被粉碎了。如果没有这场斗争，不在人民当中划清这个敌我界线，取得夏季丰收是不可能的。
    在对党外资产阶级右派分子进行斗争的同时，我们对党内的资产阶级右派分子、修正主义分子，也进行了坚决的斗争。隐藏在党内的这批人，例如浙江的沙文汉、杨思一，安徽的李世农等等，他们和党外右派分子里应外合，进行反对党的活动。不把这批人清除出去，我们的事业就会遭到严重的危害。同时，我们还对党内的一些地方主义分子、民族主义分子、右倾机会主义分子以及向党闹分散主义的分子进行了不调和的斗争。这些人存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义。他们反对鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的正确总路线。经验证明，什么地方这些人当道，那里的事情就弄得冷冷清清，停滞不前。什么地方把这些人揭发出来，不准他们在那里发号施令，那里的事情就办得轰轰烈烈，飞跃前进。我国社会主义建设事业的全面跃进，正是拔掉了这些资产阶级的白旗，插上了无产阶级的革命红旗的结果。
    根据毛泽东同志指示的原则，在机关、部队、学校、团体、工厂和农村中进行的整风运动，取得了显著的效果。运用大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报、展览会等方法，在全体人民中掀起了整改的热潮。一个农业合作社就贴出上万张大字报，从各方面揭露矛盾，内容称心而谈，形式丰富多彩。有批评、有自我批评、有表扬、有歌颂、有文字、有漫画、有诗歌、有快板。大字报的威力所指，不仅搞臭了富裕中农的资本主义道路，而且端正了干部的“三风”，扫除了他们中间的“五气”，解决了社员之间、家庭之间的各种纷争。做什么鸣放什么、辩论什么已成为干部和群众普遍欢迎的一种新方法。形象化的实物展览，已成为干部和群众自我教育的有力武器。充分发动群众自觉性、主动性的群众路线，代替了单纯自上而下的强迫命令的非群众路线；说服代替了压服。当然，目前有些地方还存在着一些不善于走群众路线的“赳赳武夫”，这些地方还有待于继续贯彻整风运动。但是，从全国范围看来，经过整改以后，干部和群众的关系是大大改善了，群众的积极性是大大提高了，顽强地克服困难的英雄气概和自觉地互相协作的共产主义精神，正在人民群众中蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    整风运动大大提高了全党的马克思主义水平，加强了党对农业生产的领导，创造性地发展了党的群众路线，从组织上有力地保证了政治挂帅。红安县委根据中央关于干部必须参加生产领导生产的指示，首创了试验田的领导方法，这个方法已被普遍推广。这是一个马克思主义的领导方法，是符合毛泽东同志实践论的原理的领导方法。它使领导机关在新的形势下更密切地联系实际、联系群众，使我们的干部进一步掌握农业生产的规律，进一步掌握群众的脉搏的跳动，从实践中提高领导水平和改进领导作风。党和政府的高级负责同志也积极响应了毛泽东同志的号召，走出办公室，深入现场，亲自发现问题总结经验，创造了现场会议、检查评比、抓两头带中间等等一系列的生动活泼、既好且快的工作方法。由于领导干部深入群众，和群众心心相印，从而大大提高了对新鲜事物的敏感，根据形势的发展，及时发现问题，及时克服缺点，及时提出新的任务，使得生产高潮一环紧扣一环，一浪高过一浪。各级党的组织在整风之后，大大健全了党委制，发挥了党的集体领导的威力，“加强第一线，拧成一股绳”，使各项工作以生产为中心，相互结合，全面跃进。党的大部分干部在运动中身先士卒，以身作则，不仅红了，而且专了，开始由外行变成内行，获得了群众无比的信任。群众把自己的干部叫做毛主席的好干部，誉为善于克敌制胜的“诸葛亮”。由于党对农业生产领导的加强，不仅改进了领导方法和领导作风，培养了大批新的骨干，而且我们还摸到了一套我国农业生产在目前条件下迅速发展的新的规律，这就是以水利建设为基础的八项增产措施。这对于进一步保证我国农业生产的大跃进，是有重要意义的。
    全民整风运动和总路线的宣传，为今年农业生产大跃进打好了思想基础。反右派斗争比较彻底地解决了政治战线和思想战线上两条道路的问题。但是，资本主义的意识形态在一些人的思想中仍然是较长期地存在的，因此，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，在思想领域中仍然是个较长期的斗争。全民整风运动和总路线的宣传，促进了思想大解放。促进了夏季的大丰收；夏季大丰收又一次有力地打击了右倾保守思想，证明了党的社会主义建设总路线的正确性。但是，先进与落后之间的矛盾和斗争是永远存在的。群众路线和反群众路线两种对立的工作方法的斗争，也将是长期存在的。为了不断地推进我国的社会主义建设事业，必须坚持毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，必须坚持政治挂帅的方针。政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂；正确处理人民内部矛盾是我们事业前进的动力，是发扬先进克服落后的武器，也就是政治思想工作的总方针。不断地、经常地抓紧政治思想工作，就可以使马克思主义在人们头脑中“密植”起来，取得思想上的大丰收，就可以不断地拔掉资产阶级的白旗，插上无产阶级的红旗，使我们的事业胜利接着胜利地前进。
    马克思主义能够出粮食，这在那些唯心论者、机械唯物论者看来，是不可理解的，但是对于按照辩证唯物主义去想问题的人们，则是完全合乎逻辑的现象。马克思主义者认为人民是历史的创造者，人类一切物质财富和精神财富都是劳动人民创造的。正确处理人民内部矛盾，就充分发挥了人的能动性，就可以创造出历史上一个崭新的局面。毛泽东同志去年夏天就指出，经过正确处理人民内部矛盾，要在我国创造一个
  “又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面”。一年来，我国的政治局面，正是按照毛泽东同志指出的这个方向发展的。这个政治局面，是在不断地发现矛盾和解决矛盾的斗争中，是在不断地正确处理了人民内部矛盾的过程中，获得不断的发展和巩固的。夏季空前大丰收，工业、农业和文化科学方面不断出现奇迹，社会主义建设全面跃进的形势，就是在这样一个政治局面不断地发展和巩固的前提下产生的。这个局面的继续发展，将是实现鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的极重要的保证。
    一切真正的科学，都是随着实践的发展而发展的。马克思列宁主义之所以具有战无不胜的威力，就在于它尊重实践，尊重客观规律。毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题、关于工作方法要适应形势的改变而改变的问题，以及由他提出的党的社会主义建设总路线，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，使我国人民的思想获得了大解放，涌现了无穷无尽的力量。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国社会主义建设的具体实践相结合的光辉范例。一切“观潮”派、“秋后算账”派、怀疑派，他们不尊重马克思列宁主义，不尊重实践，他们只见物不见人，注定是会失败的。
    毛泽东同志深刻地掌握了我国历史发展的规律，早在1950年党的七届三中全会上就提出了三年准备，十年建设，把我国建设成为现代化的社会主义国家的口号。今年初又提出“苦战三年，在绝大部分地区基本上改变我国的面貌”的号召。1955年冬季，毛泽东同志在一篇题为“发动妇女投入生产，解决了劳动力不足的困难”的文章的按语里就说过：“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。工业、交通和交换事业的发展，更是前人所不能设想的。科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业也是如此。”我国社会主义建设事业的发展，完全证明了并将继续证明毛泽东同志的预见的正确性和准确性。目前的情况不正是按照毛泽东同志的预计在发展着么？
    今年6月，毛泽东同志接见应举农业社社长时，曾经向在座的人描绘了一幅幸福生活的图景，也就是向我们提出了一个具体的奋斗目标：全国每人每年平均一千五百斤粮食，一百斤猪肉，二十斤植物油，二十斤皮棉。我们可以满怀信心地说，这样的幸福生活并不是一个太遥远的事，而是在短时期内就完全可能达到并超过这个目标。毛泽东同志曾经说过，我们应该逐步地有秩序地把“工（工业）农（农业）、商（交换）、学（文化教育）、兵（民兵，即全民武装）”组成一个大公社，从而构成为我国社会的基本单位。目前有些地方为了适应大跃进的客观要求，开始采取了并大社的方针，就是根据毛泽东同志这个指导思想发展起来的。有的农业合作社合并以后，已经买进了拖拉机、汽车、新式农具；已经办起了工厂、电站、广播站、中学、医院、俱乐部、食堂等；有的农业社的领导机构已经开始增设工业、交通、水利、技术、文化卫生等专业部门。特别是在农业生产大跃进中，广大群众社会主义积极性空前高涨，各地都已开始形成了一支又红又专的社会主义建设积极分子队伍。他们不仅是贯彻执行党的总路线、建设社会主义的骨干，而且在引导五亿农民从单纯的体力劳动逐步地走上体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的、更高的共产主义时代，也将起着骨干作用。这些新人新事，正是在毛泽东同志思想的照耀下涌现出来的，它们代表了五亿农民迅速把我国建成社会主义、并向共产主义前进的伟大愿望。
    目前，美英帝国主义正在中东张牙舞爪，他们这种海盗行径已经引起了全世界人民的愤怒，使他们在政治上陷于更加孤立的地步。他们认为他们在经济上是占上风的，一手拿着钢铁，一手拿着小麦，在全世界横行霸道。但是“夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”，帝国主义的好日子是愈来愈少了。我国农业生产战线上的伟大胜利，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性，大大加强了社会主义阵营的力量，大大有利于保卫世界和平的事业。今年我国的小麦总产量已经压倒了美国，苏联在许多方面也已经超过了它。不要多久时间，社会主义阵营的经济威力就将把帝国主义远远地抛在后面。社会主义制度将更有力地向全世界证明它自己的无比的优越性。帝国主义天天在那里指望我国出现饥荒，以便乘人之危；依靠美援过日子的南斯拉夫修正主义者也在旁边摇旗呐喊，丑化社会主义制度。我国农业生产的伟大胜利，把这些家伙弄得啼笑皆非，尴尬得很。让一切帝国主义分子和修正主义分子在他们的死胡同里胡说八道吧，中国人民已经迈开了自己的大步，将坚定地走向幸福美好的共产主义时代。
