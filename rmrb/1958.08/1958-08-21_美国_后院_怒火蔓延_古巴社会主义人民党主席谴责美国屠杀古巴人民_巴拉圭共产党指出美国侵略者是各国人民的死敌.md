Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Santiago Dispatch: The Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" published an article by Juan Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban Socialist People's Party, on July 12, strongly condemning US imperialism for helping the Batista dictatorial government cruelly suppress the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle.

The article pointed out that the guerrillas led by Castro, who were fighting in the eastern part of Cuba, have been greatly strengthened in recent weeks with the support of the local peasant masses. In other provinces, such as Camagüey and Las Villas, guerrilla activities are being organized and growing. These victories have plunged Batista and his group into despair. The government has declared a "suppression war" and is using the most barbaric and inhuman means to deal with the guerrillas. The imperialists are providing Batista with the conditions to carry out the "suppression war." The US troops stationed at Guantanamo Naval Base—very close to the area of guerrilla activity—are providing support and assistance to Batista's forces. Cuban government planes, which endlessly bomb the areas controlled by the insurgents, are supplied at the Caimanera Naval Base, where they obtain military equipment and fuel, and where they receive the full cooperation of the US Navy.

Marinello said that US imperialism has thus extremely rudely violated Cuban national sovereignty and blatantly participated in the heinous bombing (which has caused the deaths of countless peasant families and destroyed entire villages—such as in the case of La Lima—farmland, and livestock). The anger this situation has aroused among the Cuban people is the most intense and unified in recent times.

Marinello said that Dulles, when caught red-handed and undeniably, hastily declared that his government "has not given Batista improper assistance." He had nothing else to say. His so-called "normal assistance" is to give Batista's army various weapons every day to fulfill the infamous "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance." This is already an open and shameless interference in Cuba's internal affairs. Through such treaties, they constantly supply Batista with bombs, allowing him to massacre the people on a large scale in eastern Cuba. Now, faced with the people's increasingly strong resistance, Dulles and his accomplices are even directly sending troops to participate in the massacre of Cubans.

Marinello believes that the current serious conflict in Cuba will end with the victory of the people. Despite all the difficulties, the masses will overthrow the bloody government and establish a broad democratic coalition government that can open a path to freedom and progress. Marinello called on the people of the Americas to support the Cuban people and condemn the US interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Montevideo Dispatch, 19th: The Uruguayan "People's News" published a statement by the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party on the domestic political situation.

The statement assessed the serious economic situation in Paraguay caused by the "stabilization plan" imposed by the United States, and pointed out that: the country continues to be under martial law, and the government is adopting "US Article 294," according to which all patriots and democrats are being persecuted.

The statement pointed out that US oil tycoons, warmongers, and reactionary leaders in Paraguay support their tool—the military fascist group of the Stroessner dictatorship—in holding power. This group sells oil to US monopoly capital and turns the country into a US colony and military base. US imperialism is doing everything possible to support Paraguay's military police dictatorship and is the mortal enemy of the freedom and independence of all peoples. The statement also condemned the US imperialist aggression against Arab countries.

　　美国“后院”怒火蔓延
    古巴社会主义人民党主席谴责美国屠杀古巴人民
    巴拉圭共产党指出美国侵略者是各国人民的死敌
    新华社19日讯  圣地亚哥消息：智利“世纪报”7月12日刊载了古巴社会主义人民党主席胡安·马里内略的一篇文章，严厉谴责美帝国主义帮助巴蒂斯塔独裁政府残酷镇压古巴人民的革命斗争。
    文章指出，转战在古巴岛的东部地区的卡斯特罗所领导的游击队，在最近几个星期受到当地农民群众的支持而大大地加强起来。在其他省如卡马圭省和拉斯维利亚斯省，游击活动正在组织和成长中。这些胜利使得巴蒂斯塔及其集团陷入绝望的境地。政府已宣布进行“剿灭战”并且使用最野蛮和最惨无人道的手段对付游击队。帝国主义者为巴蒂斯塔提供进行“剿灭战”的条件。驻扎在关塔那摩海军基地——离游击队活动的地方非常近——的美国军队正在给巴蒂斯塔的队伍提供支持和援助。在被起义者控制的地区无休无止地进行轰炸的古巴政府的飞机在卡伊马内拉海军基地得到供应，在那里取得军事器械和燃料，在那里得到了美国海军的全面合作。
    马里内略说，美帝国主义这就极端粗暴地破坏了古巴的国家主权和明目张胆地参与了罪恶的轰炸（造成了无数农民家庭的死亡，毁坏了整个村庄——例如拉利马的情况——耕地和牲畜）。这种情况在古巴全国人民中所引起的愤怒是最近期间最为强烈和最为一致的。
    马里内略说，杜勒斯在被当场拿获和无可抵赖的情况下，急忙宣称他的政府“没有给巴蒂斯塔以不轨的援助”。他没有什么别的话好说。他的所谓“正常援助”就是每天交给巴蒂斯塔的军队以各种武器，以履行声名狼籍的“大陆防御军事条约”。这已经是对古巴内政的一种公开的和厚颜无耻的干涉。他们通过这样的条约不断把炸弹供给巴蒂斯塔，让他在古巴东部地区大规模地屠杀人民。现在，面对着人民日益强烈增长的反抗，杜勒斯及其帮凶竟然直接派兵参加对古巴人的屠杀。
    马里内略相信，古巴目前的严重冲突将以人民的胜利而告终。尽管有一切困难，群众将推翻血腥的政府，建立一个能够开辟一条自由和进步道路的、广泛的民主联合政府。马里内略呼吁美洲各国人民给古巴人民以支援，谴责美国对古巴人民内政的干涉。
    新华社20日讯  蒙得维的亚19日讯：乌拉圭“人民报”刊载了巴拉圭共产党中央委员会政治委员会就国内政治局势发表的声明。
    声明对巴拉圭由于采取美国所强加的“稳定计划”而造成的严重的经济情况作了估计，并且指出：国内继续处于戒严状态，政府正在采用“美国第二百九十四条法案”，根据这条法案，一切爱国者和民主人士都遭到迫害。
    声明指出，美国石油大王、战争贩子和巴拉圭国内的反动头子支持他们的工具——斯特罗斯纳独裁者的军事法西斯集团掌握政权，这个集团把石油出卖给美国垄断资本，把国家变为美国人的殖民地和军事基地。美帝国主义千方百计地支持巴拉圭的军事警察独裁统治，是各国人民自由和独立的死敌。声明还谴责美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的侵略。（附图片）
