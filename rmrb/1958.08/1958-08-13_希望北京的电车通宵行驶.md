　　Hoping for Beijing's Trolleybuses to Run All Night

    After reading the news "Chongqing Trolleybuses Run All Night" published in the People's Daily on August 11th, I was deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the Chongqing Public Transportation Company's employees in serving the people. From this news, I also thought of a suggestion: it seems that trolleybuses on several major lines in Beijing should also run all night. Since the Great Leap Forward, there are even more people working at night. Many units have to prepare their own cars to pick up and drop off people working the night shift, some having to make several trips. In addition, there are many people arriving and departing on trains at night. On holidays, there are even more people who need to take the bus after midnight. If there are trolleybuses available all night, it will be of great convenience to these people and can also save the country gasoline.

    Of course, since there are not many people taking the bus at night after all, only a few major lines can be opened, with a bus every half hour. I hope the relevant departments will consider and study this.

### 希望北京的电车通宵行驶

　　希望北京的电车通宵行驶
    看了人民日报8月11日刊载的“重庆电车通宵行驶”的消息，我为重庆市公共交通公司职工为群众服务的热情非常感动。从这个消息，我也想到一个意见：北京市主要几条线路的电车似乎也应该通宵行驶。大跃进以来，夜间工作的人更多了。不少单位都要自己准备汽车接送上夜班的人，有的要开几次车。另外，还有许多夜间上下火车的人。假日，在午夜十二点以后需要坐车的人更多。如果通宵有电车可坐，将给这些人很大方便，也可以为国家节省汽油。
    当然，因为夜间坐车的人终究不多，可以只开几条主要线路，半个钟头开一班。希望有关部门考虑研究。北京市　闻　英
