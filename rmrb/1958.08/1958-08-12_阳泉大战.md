The Battle of Yangquan
By Our Correspondent Mei Chu
　　
　　 Flattening Dongnaowan

    On July 10th, the Dongnaowan construction site began, marking the start of a decisive battle for Yangquan.

    Standing in the Taotang River滩 and looking up at the thirty-plus zhang high cliff is truly awe-inspiring. The soldiers of the Mining Bureau's civil engineering team, holding three or four silver water hoses, used pressure of 25 kilograms per square centimeter to impact the loess layer accumulated over millions of years. The new technology of hydraulic mining was applied to earthwork engineering, and its power was extraordinarily strong. The mountain cliff crumbled, and the yellow torrent carried hundreds of cubic meters of soil to the river滩 every hour. Two long lines of people, one above the mountain and one below, were like tug-of-war athletes, chanting slogans and pulling hard on steel cables. The steel cable was looped in the middle to form a slipknot, which was placed on isolated peaks. Before long, with a "boom" sound, the entire mountaintop was cut off and collapsed. Suddenly, the ever-playing broadcasting loudspeaker stopped, and people retreated to the valleys. Then, with an earth-shattering sound, the windows in the city rattled. Everyone knew that another large blast was underway at the construction site.

    On the construction site, there were even more people shoveling earth and pushing wheelbarrows. In Yangquan City, with a population of only 200,000, there were often three to four thousand people volunteering for labor on this construction site every day. At the construction site, there were groups of people during the day and thousands of lights at night. It was hard to tell whether it was the street women, students, or farmers from the suburbs who were working. People only knew that cadres from government offices and members of handicraft cooperatives had always been the main force on the construction site, but the night shift the day before had been overwhelmed by more than a thousand militiamen from the countryside.

    This is an undulating hill nearly forty meters high and about five li in circumference. The people of Yangquan want to reduce it to ten meters, paving it into a spacious open space, and build two blast furnaces with a volume of 255 cubic meters, two converters, two electric furnaces, plus a thin plate workshop and a steel rolling workshop. In other words, they want to install an entire iron and steel complex. In order to create such a factory site, more than 600,000 cubic meters of earth must be excavated, and nearly half of the Taotang River滩, which is nearly one li wide, must be filled. However, the people of Yangquan announced: The entire earthwork project will be completed in twenty days, and the entire factory will be built before October 1st!

    When you pantingly climb to the top of this hill that is about to be leveled, and look around at the mountain village where more than sixty families originally lived, you can't help but feel a little daunted. Can it be done, leveling it in twenty days and building a factory in eighty days?

　　 Let the Facts Speak

      "Absolutely no problem!" Anyone you ask in Yangquan City, whether it's an old lady or a Young Pioneer, will answer you like this. Their basis is not oaths and determination, nor ten or eight measures, but living reality. Haven't you seen it? Blast furnaces, converter refractory bricks, chemical fertilizers..., in the first battle, fourteen factories were built in three days and nights, and in the second battle, three hundred and sixty-eight new factories were born in seven days and nights.

    Any Yangquan person will tell you with pride and regret: It's a pity you didn't come to Yangquan those days. The scene on the construction site, anyone who saw it couldn't help but roll up their sleeves and jump onto the battlefield. The women in the streets all went into battle. On the construction site of the Dayangquan Iron Factory, under the hot sun, only hundreds of straw hats were seen moving, and no one was seen raising their head. Most of those grinding refractory bricks were foot-bound women over the age of forty. Granny Qiu, everyone knows that she has a precious niece, and she usually holds her even when cooking and doing needlework. On this day, she entrusted her niece to others to take care of, and before dawn, she went door to door to knock on doors and called her neighbors to go to the construction site together. Five old ladies, the youngest fifty years old and the oldest seventy-four years old, formed their own Mu Guiying team, wanting to compete with the young people. Sixty-four-year-old Granny Zhang got into an argument because the cadres on the construction site stopped her from working. Others didn't understand what was going on, ran over to mediate, and asked, "Granny, what do you want?" The old lady said angrily, "I want steel, what do I want?"

    Whether it's day or night, there are many people who automatically come to the construction site to work, and no one knows what organizations or groups they belong to. Farmers in the suburbs, repairing reservoirs during the day, carry their shovels and run to the construction site by themselves at night. Many families are father and son working shifts, the whole family working. Children of seven or eight years old also carry small baskets, crying and clamoring to follow their parents to "build socialism." A doggerel praising the Feng Niuhai family circulated on the construction site: "Father pulls the cart, mother shakes the sieve, and the eight-year-old leads his younger brother to carry sand."

    The Jin Opera troupe from Yuci is quite famous in Yangquan. The actors, in full costume, carrying gongs and drums, braved the heat to come to the construction site to perform a consolation performance. However, everyone was so busy that no one could spare the time to stop and watch. When the actors saw the enthusiasm on the construction site, Sun Maolin, the actor who played the old man, threw his beard and said, "Come on! Let's go too!" Everyone didn't take off their costumes and joined the brick-carrying team. The painted faces were streaked with sweat, but everyone only felt excited, and no one felt it was funny. Some people who came to watch the excitement following the sound of gongs and drums couldn't help but put their children under the shade of trees and joined in the work. The actors worked non-stop for two hours, still feeling unfulfilled, but they still had to perform on stage in the city after dinner. So, everyone elected Sun Maolin as a representative, went to the broadcaster, and sang a section of "Golden Beach" before reluctantly leaving the construction site.

    These are only the "auxiliary labor" on the construction site. Speaking of the main force - workers, government officials, handicraft cooperative members, and commercial workers, the enthusiasm is even more indescribable.

    To go to the construction site, there is a two-li long road, with a steep slope of more than a hundred meters in the middle. In the past, it took ten minutes to run this road empty-handed, and you couldn't help but pant. But this time, the young men from the Municipal People's Committee and the Provincial Handicraft Cooperative Procurement Group, carrying more than a hundred catties of sand, completed this road in only three minutes each time. A three-ton truck, full of sand, used to take fifteen people fifteen minutes to unload, but this time, eleven people unloaded it in less than forty seconds.

    On the construction site of the Dayangquan Iron Factory, the workers of the Nanzhuang Coal Mine supported the great army by passing refractory bricks weighing twenty to thirty catties at a rate of twenty times per minute. Their slogan is: "Don't want one brick, don't accept two bricks, add one brick to three bricks, and quickly pass it up." Such a live conveyor belt is arranged in three long rows, and some people's hands are scratched, but they don't bandage them, suck on them with their mouths, and continue to take the bricks and pass them on without delay. However, even so, sometimes the eighteen bricklaying workers on the blast furnace foundation are still not supplied enough. This furnace-building team has rounded up all the furnace-building "experts" in Yangquan City. As soon as they entered the construction site, they never raised their heads. The construction site with thousands of people is so tense, but it is surprisingly quiet, only the sound of the eighteen shovels hitting the bricks quickly and rhythmically envelops the construction site.

    The refractory material factory construction site needed to build a thirty-meter high chimney. According to the previous speed, it could only be built one point two meters per day, so it would take twenty-five days to complete. But this time, it was completed in only eight days, and the quality was impeccable. The slogan of the bricklaying workers - Fu Zhengxiang commando team is: "Fight hard and fight again, everyone works together, the chimney rises from the ground, advances five and a half meters a day, smoke billows on July 1st, and the red flag is planted on the side." The bricks were laid so quickly, but there were only six scaffolders in Yangquan City. These six people did not leave the construction site for four days and four nights. Later, they simply tied themselves to the scaffold with safety belts, closed their eyes for a moment, and then continued to work. Even so, they didn't feel tired, and challenged the bricklaying workers, saying:
  "The chimney rises from the ground, the scaffold follows up, guarantees no stop, and the red flag is hung on July 1st." On July 1st, the completion time changed several times. At first, it was said that it would be completed at twelve o'clock in the evening, but soon it was said that it could be completed at four o'clock in the afternoon, and after a while, it was said that it could be completed at two o'clock in the afternoon. Finally, at twelve o'clock noon, the red flag was hung on the top of the chimney.

　　 New "Norms"

    Such speed, such enthusiasm, all "norms" have no place here. It can also be said that under this revolutionary storm, the "norms" of the war period were restored, or new "norms" for the construction period were found.

    The secretaries and ministers of the Municipal Party Committee, the mayors and directors, all went to the front line in person. They are the commanders of the first line, and also ordinary laborers. For several months, the leading comrades of Yangquan City have, without exception, gone to the construction site to participate in labor for at least one day a week. Each time, it is a full eight hours, from beginning to end, without the slightest ambiguity. Some workers who know them praise them as good helpers and good laborers.

    At the Dongnaowan construction site, we saw Comrade Yang Pingjiang, the Minister of Propaganda of the Municipal Party Committee, sitting in the broadcasting shed, writing five or six broadcast drafts in a short time. The arrival of vehicles delivering materials to the construction site, the arrival of the Municipal Party Committee Secretary participating in labor, and the arrival of reporters for interviews were all good materials for him to do propaganda work. Every day, he wrote at least dozens of broadcast drafts and made four or five oral broadcasts. I don't know if it was because the Minister of Propaganda went to the front line in person, propaganda work has never been so widespread among the masses, and has never shown such a great motivating effect. Quick reports, battle letters, and commendation drafts written on loose pages torn from notebooks, on cigarette packs, and on any piece of paper were sent to the broadcasting shed hundreds of times a day.

    The construction procedure is even more revolutionary. The layout, everyone discussed and decided, and no blueprint was drawn at all. An old worker took a basket of lime, drew a white circle on the ground, and said: "The furnace is built here." The people digging the foundation went up. He then followed the hillside and gestured with his hand, saying: "The chimney is here." Before the words fell, dozens of hoes fell like raindrops along this invisible line. The installation of equipment has always been done by first laying the foundation and then installing the machine. However, here it is suggested that the converter be suspended in the air, riveting and welding above, and pouring concrete below. When the foundation is dry, remove the frame, and the furnace will fall on the furnace seat. Now, the factory has been producing for many days, and no one has found any problems such as unreasonable production lines or poor construction quality.

    We listened in on a command meeting. This meeting was to discuss three technical issues such as opening up transportation lines. The technician said: "Okay! I'll draw a sketch tomorrow." The commander heard: draw a sketch tomorrow, print a blueprint the day after tomorrow, this will take at least three or four days. He took the small blackboard, brushed a few strokes according to everyone's opinions, and said: "Isn't this a sketch! The construction site is here, everyone knows the terrain like the back of their hands. Let's do it like this!" As a result, all three problems were solved that night.

    The kind of cooperation that exists now has never existed before. In the past, whoever's thing was theirs, and large state-owned enterprises like the Mining Bureau never thought of linking up with handicraft cooperatives. But this time, whether it is the local industrial bureau building a factory or the handicraft cooperative building a factory, as long as it is said that the construction site needs it, the Mining Bureau immediately sends the most valuable seamless steel pipes, I-beams, electric motors, and large water pumps by car. When the handicraft cooperative heard that the Mining Bureau was going to build small blast furnaces and sulfur plants according to the Ministry of Coal Industry's instructions to "arm themselves", a group of people immediately went, brought their own materials, and built the two factories in seven days. Originally, the Mining Bureau only planned to build a small blast furnace with a volume of three cubic meters, and the handicraft cooperative said: "We have enough materials here." Automatically built a nine-cubic-meter one.

    These days, the doors of all warehouses in Yangquan City are open, and some invite people from the construction site to say: "You choose, take whatever you want." Some call the construction site and ask: What are you still missing? We have those those materials here, if you can use them, we will send them to you. Zhang Liang, the manager of the industrial equipment wholesale station, always carried welding rods and seamless steel pipes when he went to the construction site to work. When he arrived at the construction site and saw that it was not enough, he went back to carry it a second time.

　　 An Even Greater Battle is Behind

    Chen Ziwan, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, said: "We are getting bigger and bigger, and in the future, we will not organize voluntary labor for the handicraft cooperatives to build fifteen-cubic-meter blast furnaces. In the future, our strike force will be used on the most important projects and the most critical moments. Now, several modern large factories are being prepared. Of course, to build these factories, we will no longer use the method of drawing circles with lime, we will strictly follow the drawings. But strengthening the Party's leadership, organizing socialist cooperation, and fully relying on the masses, these basic experiences will not change.

    We believe Secretary Chen's words. Because we personally saw speed, enthusiasm, and truly liberated thinking in Yangquan. (Attached picture)

　　阳泉大战
　　本报记者　眉初
        削平东垴湾
    7月10日，东垴湾工地动工，对阳泉有决定性的一次战役开始了。
    站在桃河滩里仰望三十多丈高的峭壁，真是惊心动魄。矿务局土建工程队的战士们，手里提着三四条银色的水龙，以每平方公分承受二十五公斤的压力向千万年沉积起来的黄土层冲击。水力采煤的新技术用在了土方工程上，威力分外强大。山崖土崩瓦解了，黄色的激流每小时把几百公方的土带到河滩上。山上山下两排长长的队伍，好像拔河运动员似的，一边喊着号子，一边用劲曳着钢索。钢索中间挽成活扣，套在孤立的山峰上。没有多时，“轰”的一声，整个山头被勒断，倾倒了下来。突然，从不休息的广播喇叭不响了，人们纷纷退到山沟里去，接着，惊天动地的一声，震得城里的窗户都哗啦啦地响。大家知道，这是工地又在大爆破了。
    在工地上，更多的是用铁锹铲土，用手车推土的人。只有二十万人口的阳泉市，每天到这个工地上来义务劳动的经常有三四千人。在工地上，白天是一片一片的人，夜里是千盏万盏的灯，看不清现在轮到的是街道妇女，是学生，还是郊区的农民。人们只知道，机关干部和手工业社员一直是工地的主力，可前天晚班被四乡来的一千多民兵压倒了。
    这是一座近四十公尺高、周围约有五华里的起伏不平的山岗，阳泉人要把它削剩十公尺，铺成一片宽敞的平地，在上面建起两座二百五十五立方公尺容积的高炉，两座转炉，两座电炉，再加上一个薄板车间，一个轧钢车间。换句话说，要安上整整一个钢铁联合企业。为了辟出这样一片厂地，一共要挖掉六十多万方土，把将近一里宽的桃河滩填起一半。可是，阳泉人宣布：要在二十天里完成整个土方工程，要在10月1日以前把整个工厂建起来！
    当你气喘吁吁地爬上这将要被削掉的山顶，环视四周原来散住着六十多个人家的山村，心里难免有些发怵，二十天削成平地，八十天建成工厂，这办得到吗？
        让事实说话
      “绝对没有问题！”随便你问阳泉市的那一个人，是老太太，还是红领巾，都会这样地回答你。他们的根据，不是誓言和决心，也不是十条八条的措施，而是活生生的现实。你没有看见吗？高炉、转炉耐火砖、化学肥料……，第一个战役三昼夜，建成了十四个厂，第二个战役七昼夜，三百六十八个新厂又出世了。
    任何一个阳泉人，都会又自豪又惋惜地向你讲：可惜你那些日子没有到阳泉来。工地上那片景象啊，谁看了都忍不住要卷起袖子跳上战场。街道上的妇女们都上阵了。大阳泉铁厂的工地上，大太阳底下，只看见几百顶草帽晃动，不看见有人抬起头来。这些磨耐火砖的，大部分是四十岁以上的小脚妇女。仇老大娘，谁都知道她有个宝贝外甥女，平常连烧饭、做针线活都要抱在怀里。这日，她把外甥女托给别人照看，天不亮就挨户去敲门，把邻居们喊起来一齐到工地去。有五位老大娘，最年轻的五十岁，最老的七十四岁，自己组成了一个穆桂英小组，要和年青人比高低。六十四岁的张老太太，因为工地上的干部拦着不叫她干活，气得吵了起来。别人不明究竟，跑去劝架，问：“老大娘，您要什么啊？”老太太气虎虎地说：“我要钢，我要什么？”
    不管是白天、晚上，工地上都有许许多多自动来劳动的人，谁也不知道他们是什么机关、什么团体的。郊区的农民，白天修水库，晚上扛着铁锹自己就跑到工地来。多少户人家都是父子接班，全家劳动。七八岁的孩子也提着小筐筐，哭吵着要跟着爸爸妈妈去“建设社会主义”。工地上就流传着这样一个快板赞美冯牛孩全家：“父拉车，母摇筛，八岁的引弟把沙抬”。
    榆次的晋剧团，在阳泉很有点名气。演员们化好了装，带着锣鼓家什，冒暑走到工地来作慰问演出。可是，大伙紧张得谁也顾不上停下脚来看。演员们一看工地上这股干劲，带队的演老生的孙茂林把胡子一甩，说：“来！咱们也上！”大家戏装也没脱，就插进了传砖的队伍。花脸被汗水流得一条条的，可大家只觉得激动，没有人觉得好笑。一些跟着锣鼓声来看热闹的人，也忍不住把孩子放在树荫底下，跟着一齐干起来。演员们一气干了两个钟头没有停手，还觉得没有尽情，但是，晚饭后还要在城里登台表演呢。于是，大家就推孙茂林当代表，到广播器跟前，唱了一段“金沙滩”，才恋恋不舍地离开工地。
    这些，还仅只是工地上的“辅助劳动”。说起那些主力军——工人、机关干部、手工业社员、商业工作人员，干劲就更没有法子形容了。
    到工地去，有一段二里长的路，中间还有一道百多公尺长的陡坡。过去空手跑完这段路要十分钟，还免不了气喘。可是，这回，市人民委员会和省手工业社采购组的小伙子们，担着一百多斤砂子，每次只用三分钟就跑完了这一段路。载重三吨的汽车，装满了砂子，过去十五个人要卸十五分钟，这回，十一个人不到四十秒钟就卸完了。
    在大阳泉铁厂工地上，南庄煤矿的工人支援大军以每分钟二十次的速度传递着二三十斤重的耐火砖。他们的口号是：“一砖不要，两砖不接，三砖加一砖，快速往上传。”这样的活传动带排成长长的三列，有的人手擦破了，也不去包扎，用嘴吮一吮，照旧一刻也不耽搁地把砖接过来，又递走。可是，就这样，有时仍旧供不上高炉基础上十八个砌砖工人使用。这支筑炉队，把全阳泉市会筑炉的“专家”都网罗来了。他们一进工地，头就没有抬起来过。上千人的工地，这样紧张，却又安静得出奇，只听到那十八把铲子急促的有节奏的击砖声，笼罩着工地。
    耐火材料厂工地要筑一根三十公尺高的烟囱，按照以往的速度，每天只能砌一公尺二，这样就得二十五天才能砌完。可是，这回只用八天就砌完了，质量挑不出一点毛病来。砌?工人——傅正香突击队的口号是：“苦战再苦战，大家齐心干，烟囱平地起，日进五米半，七一冒青烟，红旗插上边。”砖砌得这样快，可是全阳泉市只有六个架子工。这六个人一连四天四夜没有离开工地，到后来，干脆用安全带把自己绑在架子上面，合一下眼又接着干。就这样，他们还不嫌累，还向砌砖工挑战，说：
  “烟囱平地起，架子跟上去，保证不停手，七一挂红旗。”。到了七一这天，竣工时间一连变了几次。最初说是晚上十二点砌完，不一会，又说是下午四点就能完，又隔一阵，说下午两点就能完了。最后，中午十二点，红旗就挂在了烟囱顶上。
        新的“常规”
    这样的速度，这样的干劲，一切“常规”在这里都没有了容身之地。也可以说，在这种革命的风暴之下，又恢复了从前战争时期的
  “常规”，或者是找到了新的建设时期的“常规”。
    市委的书记和部长们、市长和局长们，个个亲临前线。他们是第一线的指挥员，也是普通的劳动者。几个月来，阳泉市的领导同志们，无例外地每个星期至少有一天去工地参加劳动。每次都是硬硬的八小时，从头干到底，一点也不含糊。工人们有认识他们的，夸他们是好助手，好小工。
    在东垴湾工地上，我们看见市委宣传部长杨平江同志坐在广播棚里，一会儿就写了五六篇广播稿。工地来了送材料的车，来了参加劳动的市委书记，来了采访的记者，都是他做鼓动工作的好材料。每天，他至少要写几十篇广播稿，作四五次口头广播。不晓得是不是因为宣传部长亲临第一线，宣传工作从来没有出现过这样广泛的群众性，从来没有显示过这样大的鼓动作用。用本子上扯下来的散页，用纸烟盒，用随便一块什么纸写的快报、战书、表扬稿，每天都是成百遍地送到广播棚来。
    施工程序更是大革命。平面布置，大家一商量，决定了，根本不画什么蓝图。老工人拿上一筐石灰，在地上画一个白圈，说：“炉子砌在这儿。”挖基础的人就上去了。他又顺着山坡，用手一划，说：“烟囱在这儿。”话音没落，顺着这条看不见的线，几十把镢头就雨点般地落了下来。安装设备，从来都是先打好基础再安机器。可是，这里建议转炉是悬空吊着，上面铆焊，下面浇灌混凝土。等基础干了，把架子一拆，炉子正好落在炉座上。现在，工厂生产好多天了，谁也没发现什么生产线不合理，施工质量不好之类的问题。
    我们旁听过一次指挥部会议。这次会议是讨论开辟运输线等三个技术性的问题。技术人员说：“好！我明天就把草图画出来。”指挥员一听：明天画草图，后天晒蓝图，这一来至少也得三四天。他拿过小黑板，按照大家的意见，刷刷地划了几笔，说：“这不就是草图！工地就在这儿，地形大家熟得像自己的手掌心一样。就这样干吧！”结果，当天晚上就把三个问题都解决了。
    像现在这样的协作，也是从来没有过的。以前谁的东西就是谁的，像矿务局那样的国营大企业，想也没有想到过和手工业合作社挂钩。可是这回，不管是地方工业局建厂，手工业社建厂，只要说一声工地需要，矿务局马上把最贵重的无缝钢管、工字钢、电动机、大水泵，用汽车送上门来。手工业社听说矿务局根据煤炭部“自己武装自己”的指示，要建设小高炉和硫磺厂，马上就去了一帮人，自带材料，七天就把两个厂都建起来了。原来矿务局只打算筑个三立方公尺的小高炉，手工业社说：“我们这儿材料足够。”自动给砌了个九立方公尺的。
    这些天，阳泉市一切仓库的大门都敞开了，有的把工地上的人请来，说：“你们挑吧，要什么拿什么。”有的给工地打电话，问：你们还缺什么？我们这里有那些那些材料，要用得上，我们就给送去。工业器材批发站的经理张良同志，每次去工地劳动，都顺便扛着电焊条和无缝钢管。到了工地，看见不够，又回去扛第二遍。
      更大的战斗在后面
    市委书记陈子万说：“我们越干越大了，将来手工业社筑十五立方公尺的高炉，再不会给他们组织义务劳动了。将来我们的突击力量要用在最主要的工程、最关键的时刻上。现在，几个现代化的大厂都正在加紧筹备。当然，建设这些厂，我们不会再用石灰画圈圈的办法，我们要严格地按照图纸施工。但是，加强党的领导、组织社会主义大协作、充分依靠群众，这些基本经验是不会变的。
    我们相信陈书记的话。因为我们在阳泉亲眼看见了速度、干劲和真正解放了的思想。（附图片）
