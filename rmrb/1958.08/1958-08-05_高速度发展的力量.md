　　The Power of High-Speed Development

　　In Zhejiang Province's rush to harvest, plant, and combat drought, over two million people have broken through the geographical boundaries between cities and rural areas, mountainous and plain regions, coastal and inland areas, economic crop zones and rice-growing areas, and between one region and another. At the same time, they have shattered the numerous shackles of people's ideological habits, contributing the maximum amount of manpower and material resources to support neighboring regions. This is no small matter.

　　If we look at the numbers alone, two million people are nothing special in our large and populous country. Even if each person helps with ten workdays, it only amounts to twenty million workdays. However, according to a rough estimate, Zhejiang alone needs over four hundred million workdays for harvesting and planting in July and August of this year. If we add the labor required for accumulating fertilizer, small-scale water conservancy projects, field management, sideline production, and drought resistance, it would amount to over six hundred million workdays. Compared to six hundred million workdays, twenty million workdays is only a little more than one-thirtieth.

　　But the real significance of this matter is far greater than what is expressed in the numbers. The reason why artificial satellites can fly into the sky is that the speed of the carrier rocket has reached the first cosmic velocity, freeing it from the control of Earth's gravity. The fact that two million people in Zhejiang have broken free from the various restrictions of geographical boundaries and the shackles of ideological habits to support other regions is a remarkable event. Since the Great Leap Forward, no cooperative has felt that there is no labor shortage. Therefore, people breaking through the shackles of the old "self-concerned" thinking and the boundaries of long-distance regions cannot be said otherwise to be like an artificial satellite breaking through the earth's gravity, it has created our human world's first speed, will enable our socialist construction to fly forward at high speed development.

    高速度发展的力量
    浙江省在抢收、抢种、抗旱中，有二百多万人冲破了城市与农村、山区与平原、海洋与陆地、经济作物区与水稻区、这一地区与那一地区之间的地域上的界限，同时冲破了人们思想习惯上的重重束缚，拿出最大限度的人力和物力，支援友邻地区，这不是一件小事。
    如果光从数字来看，二百多万人在地大人多的我国是没有什么了不起的，即使每人以帮助十个工计算，也不过二千万个工日。而浙江在今年7、8月间仅抢收抢种一项所需要的劳动日，据粗略计算，就要四亿多工，如果加上积肥、小修水利、田间管理、副业生产和抗旱等所需的劳动，那就要六亿工以上。二千万工与六亿工相比，只及三十分之一多。
    但这件事情的真正意义，远比从数字上表现出来的伟大得多。人造卫星所以能够飞上天空，就因为运载火箭的速度达到了宇宙第一速度，它摆脱了地心吸力的控制。浙江二百万人摆脱了地理界域上的种种限制和思想习惯上的束缚，去支援别的地区，这是一件了不起的大事。大跃进以后，没有一个合作社不感到劳动力紧张，四季之内也没有一时一刻劳动力是会有余的。因此，人们冲破“自顾自”的旧思想的束缚和远距离的地域界限这件事，就不能不说像人造卫星冲破地心吸力一样，它创造了我们人间的第一速度，将使我们的社会主义建设高速度向前飞跃发展。
