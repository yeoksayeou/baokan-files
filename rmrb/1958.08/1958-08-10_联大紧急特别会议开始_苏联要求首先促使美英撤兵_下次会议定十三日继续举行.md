Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: TASS, New York, August 8th dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Emergency Special Session opened in New York at 5:15 PM local time on August 8th (5:15 AM Beijing time on August 9th). It was presided over by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who designated the President of the 12th UN General Assembly, Munro (representative of New Zealand), as chairman.

After a brief speech by Munro, the meeting approved the following agenda: "The issues discussed by the United Nations Security Council at its meeting on August 7, 1958."

Speaking at the meeting were Soviet representative Sobolev, U.S. representative Lodge, and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

Sobolev stated that the Soviet delegation agreed to approve the agenda of the Third Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, taking as its starting point that the main task of this session is to take effective measures to ease international tensions and eliminate the danger of war caused by the aggressive actions of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Near and Middle East.

The General Assembly should swiftly and comprehensively halt armed intervention in the Near and Middle East and create conditions that would allow the people of the region to be free from foreign interference in their internal affairs.

The first step should be to take measures to ensure the withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, as their presence there is a constant threat to peace and the security of all peoples and seriously violates the United Nations Charter, which no member state of the United Nations can tolerate.

It is well known that the Security Council, due to its current membership and the policy adopted by the United States, has been unable to take effective measures to extinguish the increasingly tense military conflict in the Arab East at the outset. This shows that the Security Council cannot fulfill the responsibility entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter to maintain peace and international security.

In this situation, the United Nations General Assembly, with the participation of both large and small countries, should, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, resolve the issue of the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan. This will help to eliminate the real threat of expanding military conflict, thereby restoring tranquility in the Near and Middle East and easing tensions worldwide.

The Soviet delegation hopes that the activities and decisions of the Third Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly will contribute to easing tensions, consolidating peace, and eliminating the threat of a new world war. Aggression against the Arab Eastern countries must be stopped. Peace must prevail.

U.S. representative Lodge then spoke, asking meeting participants to avoid mutual recriminations and seek constructive resolutions. The U.S. representative's speech was tantamount to asking everyone not to question the U.S. military occupation of Lebanon, although it is clear to everyone that unless U.S. and British troops withdraw immediately from Lebanon and Jordan, it will be impossible to make any truly constructive resolutions.

UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld spoke last at the meeting. He said that the meeting has a specific agenda regarding the situation that has recently developed in the Near and Middle East. However, the Secretary-General believes that the United Nations Emergency Special Session should discuss the various issues in the Near and Middle East in a broader sense.

Hammarskjöld listed a number of issues that he believed needed to be discussed and resolved immediately. These issues include: the future functions of various UN agencies in the region; the issue of providing economic and technical assistance to countries in the Near and Middle East; and the issue of cooperation between these countries and countries in other regions of the world. However, while listing these "urgent" issues, he completely avoided mentioning the issue that is causing concern worldwide: stopping Anglo-American aggression and the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan.

On the recommendation of the chairman, the meeting did not begin substantive discussion of the issues on the agenda.

The next meeting is scheduled for August 13th.

### 联大紧急特别会议开始  苏联要求首先促使美英撤兵  下次会议定十三日继续举行

    联大紧急特别会议开始
    苏联要求首先促使美英撤兵
    下次会议定十三日继续举行
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：联合国大会紧急特别会议在纽约时间8日下午五时十五分（北京时间9日上午五时十五分）开幕，由联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德主持，他让联合国大会第十二届会议主席孟罗（新西兰代表）担任主席。
    孟罗发表简短演说后，会议批准议程如下：“联合国安全理事会在1958年8月7日会议上所讨论的各项问题”。
    在会上发言的有苏联代表索波列夫、美国代表洛奇和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。
    索波列夫说，苏联代表团同意批准联合国大会第三次紧急特别会议议程的出发点是：这次会议的主要任务是采取有效措施来缓和国际紧张局势和消除由美英两国在中近东的侵略行动所造成的战争危险。
    大会应当迅速全面地制止在中近东的武装干涉和创造能够使这一地区的人民不受外国干涉他们内政的条件。
    首先应当采取措施使美国军队和英国军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，因为它们驻扎在那里是对和平和各国人民安全的经常威胁，并且严重地破坏了联合国宪章，这是任何一个联合国会员国都不能容忍的。
    大家知道，安全理事会由于目前的成员和美国对它采取的政策而不能采取有效措施使得能在一开始时就扑灭阿拉伯东方日益紧张的军事冲突。这表明安全理事会不能完成联合国宪章所赋予它的维护和平和国际安全的责任。
    在这种情况下，大国和小国都有代表参加的联合国大会就应当根据联合国宪章的原则和宗旨来解决美军立即撤出黎巴嫩和英军立即撤出约旦的问题。这样有助于消除扩大军事冲突的现实威胁，从而恢复中近东地区的安宁并缓和全世界的紧张局势。
    苏联代表团希望联合国大会第三次紧急特别会议的活动和决定将促使缓和紧张局势、巩固和平和消除新的世界大战的威胁。对阿拉伯东方国家的侵略应当制止。和平应当获胜。
    接着美国代表洛奇发言，他要求会议参加者避免互相指责而要寻求建设性的决议。美国代表的发言无异于要大家不要过问美军占领黎巴嫩这件事，虽然大家都清楚如果美英军队不立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，就不可能作出任何真正建设性的决议。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在会议上最后发言。他说，会议有关于中近东地区不久前所形成的局势的具体议程。但是，这位秘书长认为，联合国紧急特别会议应当在更广泛的意义上讨论中近东的各项问题。
    哈马舍尔德列举了许多他认为需要立即讨论和解决的问题。这些问题有：在这一地区联合国各种机构今后的职能；向中近东国家提供经济和技术援助的问题以及这些国家和世界其他地区国家之间的合作问题。但是，他在列举这些“迫切”问题时却完全避而不谈使全世界感到不安的问题、即制止英美侵略和美军立即撤出黎巴嫩和英军立即撤出约旦的问题。
    根据主席的建议，会议没有开始讨论列入日程的问题的实质。
    下次会议定于8月13日举行。
