    "Record of Moving Mountains"
    This is a new full-length novel by Chen Dengke, depicting the construction of a continuous arch dam at a reservoir in the Dabie Mountains. Through a broad panorama of life, the author unfolds a series of extremely complex contradictions and struggles: there are the conspiracies and sabotage of special agents, the contradictions between two ideological styles of work, and the breathtaking scenes of battling floods. All those who participated in this project were tempered and improved.
    (Huang Yi)
