　　These past few days, upon entering the translation office of the Liaison Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, one could see the desks and floors of French translators Li Mingmo and Yang Danhua piled high with books and other materials like small mountains. It turned out they were compiling a "Chinese-French Commodity Concordance," something that didn't exist in Chinese history. Speaking of this concordance, comrades at the Ministry of Foreign Trade also told me about a past incident where a freight list was mistakenly translated because such a concordance didn't exist. At the time, although some people wanted to compile a "Chinese-French Commodity Concordance," they were considered to be "daydreaming."

　　Now, they are determined to compile a Chinese-French Commodity Concordance. The young French translators Li Mingmo and Yang Danhua took on this task. Neither of them had much translation experience, and there were no readily available materials. However, they thought, "Where there's a will, there's a way." If they didn't have materials, they would look everywhere. In addition to finding the Chinese-French dictionaries and Chinese-English dictionaries that could be found domestically, they regarded even imported trademarks, packaging paper, order forms, postcards, and envelopes as "treasures."

　　In this way, they overcame the difficulty of lacking materials, worked hard for nine days and nights, and finally compiled a "Chinese-French Commodity Concordance" containing more than three thousand words. (Attached picture)

　　前人不干后人干
    这几天，人们一走进外贸部交际处翻译办公室，只见法文翻译李明谟、杨旦华同志的办公桌上、地上，书籍等东西堆得像小山一样高，原来他们在编译中国历史上没有的“中、法文商品对照词汇”。说起这个词汇，外贸部同志还告诉我过去因为没有这种词汇，曾闹过一次译错货单的笑话。当时虽然也有人想编译一本“中、法文商品对照词汇”，却被人认为是“异想天开”。
    现在，他们决心编译一本中、法文商品对照词汇。年青的法文翻译李明谟、杨旦华担任了这个任务，两个人翻译经验都不怎么熟，又没有现成的资料。但是，他们想：“有志者事竟成”，没有资料，他们就到处找寻，除了找到国内能够找到的中、法文词典，中、英文词典……外，那怕是从国外进口的商标、包装纸、订货单、明信片、信封，他们都视如“珍宝”。
    就这样，他们克服了缺资料的困难，苦战了九个昼夜，终于编出了一本包括三千多个词汇的“中、法文商品对照词汇”。（附图片）
