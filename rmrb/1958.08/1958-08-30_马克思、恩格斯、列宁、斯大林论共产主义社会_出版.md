　　Publication of "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Communist Society"

　　This newspaper reports that the People's Publishing House published "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Communist Society" on the 29th of this month.

　　This book is a compilation of excerpts from the existing Chinese translations of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin concerning the future communist society (with a few directly translated from foreign language editions). The entire book is divided into twenty-five chapters based on nature. The first chapter is a depiction of the general outline of communist society by the classic writers. In the following chapters, the establishment of communist public ownership, the material foundation of communist society, and issues such as production, distribution, consumption, reproduction, and labor under the communist system are described separately. There are dedicated chapters in the book addressing issues that we are particularly concerned with now, such as the elimination of differences between urban and rural areas and between manual and mental labor, and the integration of industry and agriculture. The commune issue, which has pressing practical significance for the people of our country, is also discussed in the book. In the final chapters of this book, there are also discussions by these Marxist-Leninist classic writers on issues such as education, culture, language, family, marriage, women, population, morality, etc. in communist society, and on how to transition to communist society.
