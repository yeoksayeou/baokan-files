    Old Woman Reports Theft of Baggage, Young Woman Identifies Thief by Scent of Cake
    Not long ago, a crowd gathered at the ferry terminal in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, discussing something. It turned out that a traveling bag belonging to an old woman named Xiong had been stolen. She described the contents of the bag and lamented her misfortune. Public security personnel arrived at the scene to investigate but found no clues. So, they turned to Miss Yan Biru, a ferry attendant who had assisted in solving cases many times before, for help. After thinking for a moment, the young woman said with confidence, "I think the thief must be a highly skilled 'professional' offender, which is why they dared to commit the crime in broad daylight. Such people like to hang around docks and theaters. This dock is a transportation hub, and they will most likely pass through here. Mrs. Xiong's bag contained several sesame pepper cakes. The aroma of this cake is different from other foods. If I pay attention, I might be able to detect it."
    The public security personnel found Yan Biru's analysis reasonable and proceeded with another investigation while entrusting her to keep a close watch and assist. Yan Biru waited at the ferry ticket gate, carefully smelling the luggage of anyone carrying a bag and appearing suspicious. But until sunset, she had not found any suspicious criminal elements. Yan Biru thought: this habitual offender will definitely not stay in Xiangtan overnight, and will probably take a ferry under cover of darkness when there are many people. So she paid even more attention. At a little past ten o'clock, she indeed smelled the aroma of sesame pepper cakes emanating from a person's travel bag. This person was lying there sleeping, and had not yet crossed the river. After questioning by public security personnel, the stolen goods were found, and the habitual offender was apprehended.

    失行囊老妇报窃案  闻饼香姑娘识盗贼
    不久前，湖南省湘潭县轮渡码头上围着一群人议论纷纷。原来是一位路过这里的熊大妈的旅行袋被人偷去了。她叙述着袋里装的东西，诉说着不幸。公安人员赶到现场侦察，也没发现什么痕迹，于是便找到了曾经多次协助破案的候轮员颜碧如姑娘，请求协助。这个姑娘想了想，很有把握地说：“我看这人必定是个‘手艺’很高的惯犯，因此才敢在白天作案。这种人最喜欢跑码头，逛戏院。这个码头是交通要道，他多半会从这里通过。熊大妈丢的袋子里有几块芝麻胡椒饼，这饼的香味同别的食品不同，我留心闻闻，很可能发现。”
    公安人员听了颜碧如的分析，认为很有道理，便一面另行访查，一面委托她留神协助。颜碧如就在轮渡剪票的地方守候，见有拿着旅行袋又可疑的人便留神闻一闻。但直到日落西山，还没有发现犯罪可疑分子。颜碧如想：这个惯犯夜里一定不在湘潭住，多半要在天黑人多时搭轮逃跑，于是更留心了。到十点多钟，果真闻到芝麻胡椒饼的香味从一个人的旅行袋里散发出来。这个人正躺在那里睡觉，还没有过江。经公安人员盘查，搜出了赃物，捉住了那个惯犯。
