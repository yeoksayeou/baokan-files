    The Correct Approach to Solving Industrial Working Capital Problems
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    The Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China recently held an on-site meeting in Lüda City to exchange experiences in the management of industrial working capital.

    This meeting was held at a very opportune time. This year, industrial production and capital construction are advancing simultaneously. The experience in the first half of the year proves that China's industrial production can develop at an extraordinary speed. It also proves that there is indeed huge capital potential that can be tapped to support the high-speed development of production. Of course, the simultaneous leap forward in capital construction and production, and the simultaneous leap forward in various industrial productions, will encounter difficulties and contradictions in capital supply. The difficulties and contradictions that arise in this vigorous Great Leap Forward were anticipated in advance. Without overcoming all kinds of difficulties, there would be no Great Leap Forward. Everyone knows that capital is the monetary expression of materials. The development of capital construction requires materials and capital, and the comprehensive development of industrial production also requires materials and capital. Only by rationally organizing the use of materials and capital, and doing more with less, can we achieve a high-speed development of production and construction. Therefore, correctly and promptly solving the problem of working capital is a requirement for production development, a demand of the broad masses, and a task of great political and economic significance.

    There are two different viewpoints and two different methods for solving the capital problem. One is the viewpoint of emphasizing the tension of capital and restricting the development of production, and the method of relying on a few people to manage capital. The other is the viewpoint of serving production, supporting the development of production, and the mass line method of relying on the majority to manage capital. Obviously, the second method is the correct one.

    The rational use of working capital and the high-speed development of production may seem to be contradictory, but they are actually a unity of opposites. The development of production requires capital, and the rational use of capital can promote the development of production more quickly and better. Judging from the experience summarized at this on-site meeting, it is precisely because of putting politics in command that the Great Leap Forward in production, the Great Leap Forward in various tasks, and also the leap forward in working capital have been brought about. And the leap forward in working capital is a necessary condition for ensuring the high-speed development of production and construction. This year, the total value of state-owned industrial output in Lüda City increased by 40%, while working capital not only did not increase, but decreased by 25 million yuan compared to the previous year. In the first half of the year, more than half of the enterprises in the city achieved the slogan of "increasing production without increasing capital." Judging from the occupation of working capital by national state-owned industrial enterprises in the past three years, in 1956, production leaped forward, capital turnover accelerated, material backlog reduced, and working capital occupied per hundred yuan of output value was 16.8 yuan, and the turnover days were 99.4 days. In 1957, due to the influence of the "anti-adventurism" error, the turnover of working capital was slow, material backlog increased, and working capital occupied per hundred yuan of output value was 18.5 yuan, and the turnover days were 107.7 days. In the first half of 1958, production leaped forward greatly, capital turnover was greatly accelerated, and material backlog and waste were greatly reduced. This fact shows that only by developing production can we save capital and rationally use capital. Chairman Mao taught us in the article "Economic Problems and Financial Problems in the Anti-Japanese War Period": "The merits of financial policy can certainly affect the economy, but it is the economy that determines finance. There is no way to solve financial difficulties without an economic foundation, and there is no way to make finance sufficient without economic development. ...Forgetting to develop the economy, forgetting to open up financial resources, and attempting to solve financial difficulties by contracting essential financial expenditures is a conservative view that cannot solve any problems." Many of our financial workers have precisely this conservative view, failing to correctly handle the relationship between production and finance. Their thinking often cannot leave the financial circle, and they do not give enough consideration to supporting the high-speed development of production. In terms of capital management, they have not realized that only by developing production can we increase capital sources and rationally and economically use capital. Therefore, they do not strive to organize capital to serve the development of production. Sometimes they even use capital to determine production, one-sidedly emphasizing supervision and restraint, thus hindering production. Obviously, this is a very wrong viewpoint.

    The high-speed development of production is a matter for every enterprise and everyone in the country, not just for one department or one unit. Financial work and banking work support the development of production and serve production, so they must proceed from the overall situation, ensuring both the supply of necessary capital and organizing the rational use of capital, and comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Strengthening the production viewpoint and serving the high-speed development of production must implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. Some people, under the pretext of ensuring production needs, attempt to occupy too much of the state's materials and capital, even at the cost of wasting the state's valuable materials and capital. They only know how to reach out to the higher authorities, hoping to get everything they ask for, or want to squeeze the materials and capital of other units to satisfy themselves. Therefore, they cannot look downward, rely on the masses, rely on their own efforts, and tap potential to ensure the capital needs of production development. This is also a one-sided viewpoint, which is also unfavorable to the high-speed development of production and construction.

    Can enterprises internally tap a large amount of capital potential to support the great development of production? Many facts and many experiences show that a large amount of potential exists within enterprises. Many enterprises have small warehouses. Some enterprises reported that in the past, the place where coal was piled up could be burned for three months just by "scraping the ground." Lüda City can dig out 50,000 tons of steel using the methods of "digging, salvaging, finding, saving, substituting, and increasing production." Shenyang City can dig out 100,000 tons of steel and 10,000 machines using the method of "five digging." Other industrial cities can also dig out a large amount of materials. If the country's industrial working capital is saved by just 5%, it is a considerable figure. It can be seen from this that digging into the internal material and capital potential to ensure the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production is promising and is also a correct way to solve the problem of working capital.

    Doing a good job in capital work, like other work, must implement the mass line, give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses, and rely on everyone to manage capital. Therefore, we must correctly resolve the relationship between leaders and the masses, the relationship between centralization and decentralization, and the relationship between division of labor and collaboration. We must rely on the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, raise ideological awareness, and fully mobilize the masses. Only in this way can we achieve good results. To tap the potential of materials and capital, only by fully mobilizing the masses and carrying out a broad mass movement can we achieve significant results. Relying on the masses to manage capital changes the uncoordinated situation in which a few financial personnel manage capital, while those who manage production and operation do not manage capital, and establishes a new relationship of everyone being responsible, cooperating with each other, and leaping forward together under a unified plan. This is a correct direction for capital management that follows the mass line. However, we have only just found a correct path for implementing the mass line in capital management, and we still need to continuously develop and improve it in future practical work, based on specific circumstances. In the future, we must further reform the system, adjust relationships, and simplify procedures to facilitate the full play of the enthusiasm of the masses.

    We believe that through this on-site meeting, by holding high the red flag of serving production and implementing the mass line in capital management, we will surely be able to make greater achievements and create more experience to ensure that the leap forward in production and construction leaps forward again.

    解决工业流动资金问题的正确途径
    本报评论员
    财政部和中国人民银行最近在旅大市召开了现场会议，交流了工业流动资金管理的经验。
    这次会议开得很适时。今年的工业生产是和基本建设同时跃进的，上半年的经验证明：我国的工业生产是可以用异乎寻常的速度来发展的；同时也证明客观上确实存在着巨大的资金潜力，可以挖掘出来，支持生产的高速度发展。当然，基本建设和生产同时跃进，各种工业生产同时跃进，是会遇到资金供应上的困难和矛盾的。在这种轰轰烈烈的大跃进当中出现的困难和矛盾，是事先已经预料到的。不战胜各种各样的困难，就没有什么大跃进。大家都知道，资金是物资的货币表现，基本建设的发展需要物资和资金，工业生产的全面发展也需要物资和资金。合理地组织物资和资金的使用，用比较少的物资和资金办更多的事，才能有生产和建设的高速度的发展。因此，正确地、及时地解决流动资金问题，是生产发展的要求，是广大群众的要求，也是具有重大政治意义和经济意义的任务。
    解决资金问题，有两种不同的观点和两种不同的方法。一种是强调资金的紧张而束缚生产发展的观点和依靠少数人管理资金的方法；另一种是为生产服务、支持生产发展的观点和依靠多数人管理资金的群众路线的方法。很显然，第二种方法才是正确的。
    流动资金的合理使用和生产的高速度发展，看起来好像是对立的，其实是矛盾的统一体。生产的发展需要资金，资金的合理使用就能更多更快地推动生产的发展。从这次现场会议所总结的经验来看，正是由于政治挂帅带来了生产的大跃进，带来了各种工作的大跃进，也带来了流动资金工作的跃进；而流动资金工作的跃进，又是保证生产建设高速度发展的必要条件。今年旅大市国营工业产值上升40％，而流动资金不但没有增加，反而比上年减少二千五百万元。在上半年全市有半数以上的企业实现了“增产不增资”的口号。从三年来全国国营工业企业流动资金的占用情况来看，1956年生产跃进，资金周转加速，物资积压减少，每百元产值占用流动资金为十六点八元，周转天数是九十九点四天；1957年由于“反冒进”的错误的影响，流动资金周转迟缓，物资积压增加，每百元产值占用流动资金为十八点五元，周转天数是一百零七点七天；1958年上半年生产大跃进，资金周转大大加速，物资积压浪费大大减少。这种事实说明：只有发展生产，才能节约资金，合理的使用资金。毛主席在“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”一文中教导我们：“财政政策的好坏，固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济，未有经济无基础而可以解决财政困难的，未有经济不发展而可以使财政充裕的。……忘记发展经济，忘记开辟财源，而企图从收缩必不可少的财政开支去解决财政困难的保守观点，是不能解决任何问题的。”我们有不少财务工作人员正是存在着这种保守观点，没有正确处理生产和财务的关系，考虑问题常常离不开财政圈子，对支持生产的高速度发展却是考虑不够的。在资金管理上，没有认识到只有发展生产，才能增加资金来源，才能合理地节省地使用资金。因此不去努力组织资金，为发展生产服务；有时却甚至要以资金去决定生产，片面强调监督和制约，因而妨碍了生产。很显然，这是一种十分错误的观点。
    高速度的发展生产，是全国每个企业每个人的事情，不是一个部门一个单位的事情。财政工作和银行工作支持生产的发展，为生产服务，就必须从全局出发，既要保证必要的资金的供应，又要组织资金的合理使用，全面地贯彻多、快、好、省的方针。加强生产观点，为高速度发展生产服务，就必须贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针。有些人借口保证生产需要，企图占用国家过多的物资和资金，甚至不惜浪费国家宝贵的物资和资金，只知道伸手向上要，希望有求必应，或者想挤别的单位的物资和资金来满足自己，因此不能眼睛向下，依靠群众，自力更生，挖掘潜力，保证生产发展的资金需要，这也是一种片面观点，对于高速度发展生产建设也是不利的。
    企业内部能不能大量地挖掘出资金潜力来支持生产的大发展呢？许多事实和许多经验都说明企业内部的潜力是大量存在的。不少企业都有小仓库，有些企业反映，过去堆煤炭的地方，“刮刮地皮”就可以烧三个月。旅大市用“挖、捞、找、省、代和增产”的办法，可以挖出五万吨钢铁。沈阳市用“五挖”的办法，可以挖出十万吨钢铁、一万台机器，其他的工业城市同样也是能够挖出大量物资的。全国工业流动资金只要节约5％，就是一个相当可观的数字。由此可见，挖掘内部的物资和资金潜力，保证生产大跃进的需要，是大有可为的，也是一条解决流动资金问题的正确途径。
    做好资金工作和其他工作一样，必须贯彻群众路线，必须发挥广大群众的积极性和主动性，依靠大家来管理资金。因此一定要正确解决领导和群众的关系、集中与分权的关系、分工和协作的关系；一定要依靠党的领导，政治挂帅，提高思想觉悟，充分发动群众，只有这样，才能取得良好的效果。挖掘物资和资金的潜力，只有充分发动群众，开展广泛的群众运动，才能取得重大的成绩。依靠群众来管理资金，这就改变了少数财务人员管资金、而管生产经营的人却不管资金的互不协调的局面，建立了在统一计划下，人人负责、互相协作、共同跃进的新关系。这就是一种走群众路线的资金管理的正确方向。不过，我们在资金管理上贯彻群众路线，才刚刚找到一条正确的门路，还需要在今后的实际工作中，根据具体情况，不断地加以发展和完善。今后还必须进一步改革制度，调整关系，简化手续，以利于充分发挥群众的积极性。
    我们相信，经过这次现场会议，在资金管理工作中高举起为生产服务，贯彻群众路线的红旗，就一定能够做出更大的成绩，创造出更多的经验，以保证生产建设的跃进再跃进。
