Effective Cure, Rapid Fattening, Cheap Price
　　"Feed-Grade Chlortetracycline" Trial Production Successful
　　Ministry of Agriculture Promotes Zhangjiakou Prefecture's Indigenous Manufacturing Experience
　　(Our Dispatch) The Zhangjiakou Prefectural Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau in Hebei Province, using the chlortetracycline bacteria strain, a precious veterinary medicine donated by the Soviet Union, has successfully trial-produced "feed-grade chlortetracycline" using indigenous methods. Many agricultural cooperatives throughout the prefecture have established factories for its manufacture, adding another treasure to science and technology in animal husbandry.
　　Because this medicine is extremely effective in treating diseases and rapidly fattening livestock and poultry, its value is immense, and the Ministry of Agriculture attaches great importance to it. Under the promotion of relevant central departments and the leadership of provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees, it is currently being promoted throughout Hebei Province and will be extended to the entire country to promote the development of disease prevention and fattening work in animal husbandry nationwide.
　　Chlortetracycline is a highly effective and precious medicine that can prevent and treat typhoid, paratyphoid, chicken bacillary white diarrhea, anthrax, glanders, and infectious abortion in livestock of all sizes. It can also promote the development of livestock and poultry and increase their weight. Chickens in the Shajiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Wanquan County, Zhangjiakou Prefecture, were infected with bacillary white diarrhea, with forty to fifty chicks dying every day. After being fed self-made feed-grade chlortetracycline, the deaths stopped within three days. The May 1st Pig Farm fed 430 piglets with feed-grade chlortetracycline, and all of them had shiny coats and increased weight. The Chengguanzhen Collective Pig Farm used it to treat more than fifty pigs suffering from paratyphoid, with the pigs showing improvement within three days and recovering within ten days, costing only five fen per pig.
　　The production of this medicine involves complex techniques and numerous procedures, and in the past, it was unthinkable to produce it in rural areas. However, by breaking with convention, the seventeen counties and cities of Zhangjiakou Prefecture adopted the method of simultaneous experimentation, teaching, factory construction, production, and treatment. More than 3,000 agricultural cooperative epidemic prevention workers have learned the manufacturing techniques. At the same time, each agricultural cooperative established more than 300 chlortetracycline manufacturing plants, which are now formally in production. It is estimated that by the end of this month, there will be 1,000 factories operating throughout the region.
　　In the production process, the masses of farmers overcame many difficulties. The Shajiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Wanquan County, lacking an electric shaker, stretched an iron wire, connected springs to both ends, and hung more than ten culture flasks in the middle, which could be shaken by pulling the rope. The factory run by the Kongjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative used a bamboo bow instead of a spring, which was even more economical and convenient. In order to save raw materials, these two cooperatives also washed and disinfected the culture medium after use and reused it continuously three or four times.
　　When the Ministry of Agriculture held the National Corn Stalk Silage On-Site Conference in Sanhe County, Hebei Province, it immediately opened a training class in the county to teach the technology. More than 300 representatives from 15 provinces and cities who attended the on-site conference learned the manufacturing techniques and are preparing to widely teach and promote them in their respective provinces after returning.

　　治病灵效　肥育迅速　价钱便宜
    “饲用金霉素”试制成功
    农业部推广张家口专区土法制造经验
    本报讯　河北省张家口专署畜牧兽医局使用苏联赠给的兽医珍贵药品金霉素菌种，用土法试制成功“饲用金霉素”，已在全专区许多农业社里开厂制造。使科学技术在畜牧业上又添一宝。
    由于这种药品对家畜家禽治病灵效、肥育迅速，价值极大，农业部极为重视。在中央有关部门的推动和省、专、县各级党委的主持下，现正在河北全省推广，并将推广到全国，以促进全国畜牧业防病、肥育工作的发展。
    金霉素是一种疗效很高的珍贵药品，它能防治禽畜的伤寒、副伤寒、鸡白痢、炭疽、鼻疽及大小家畜的传染性流产等，并能促进禽畜发育，增长体重。张家口专区万全县沙家庄农业社的鸡群染有白痢，每天要死亡四、五十只小鸡，用自己制的饲用金霉素喂后，三天即停止死亡。五一养猪厂以饲用金霉素喂了四百三十口仔猪，个个毛色光亮，体重增加。城关镇集体养猪场用它治疗副伤寒病猪五十多头，三天病轻，十天痊愈，每头猪只花了五分钱。
    生产这种药品，技术复杂，工序繁多，过去不敢设想拿到农村去生产。但是在打破常规的做法下，张家口专区的十七个县市采取边试验、边传授、边建厂、边生产、边治疗的办法，已有三千多名农业社防疫员学会了制作技术。同时，各农业社建立了三百多个金霉素制造厂，正式投入生产。预计到本月底止，全区将有一千个工厂开工。
    在生产过程中，农民群众克服了许多困难。万全县沙家庄农业社没有电动振荡机，就拉上一条铁丝，两头连上弹簧，中间挂上十余个培养瓶，以绳牵动即能振荡。孔家庄农业社办的工厂以竹弓子代替弹簧，更为经济方便。为了节省原料，这两社还把菌种培养基用过后洗净消毒，再连续使用三四次。
    农业部在河北三河县召开全国玉米秸青贮现场会议时，当场在这个县开班训练，传授技术。参加现场会议的十五个省市三百余名代表，都学习了制作技术，回去后准备在各省普遍传授推广。
