Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: “Komsomolskaya Pravda” published today a letter from Soviet citizen and Komsomol member Polyakova. The letter recounts her experience of being unjustly imprisoned and interrogated for sixty-eight days by the Yugoslav authorities when she went to Yugoslavia this year to visit her father.

In her letter, Polyakova pointed out that her father was originally a Yugoslav political exile living in the Soviet Union. Later, he went to Spain to participate in the struggle to defend the Spanish Republic, and then returned to Yugoslavia to work. She went to Yugoslavia to visit her father in January of this year. After visiting her father, in March, when she was trying to return to her country in Belgrade, she was arrested and imprisoned in a hotel by the Yugoslav police authorities. During her imprisonment, the Yugoslav police authorities did not allow her to contact the Soviet Embassy in Yugoslavia and interrogated her many times, demanding that she state the purpose of her visit to Yugoslavia and her views on the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. They also threatened her to stay in Yugoslavia.

Polyakova said that after her repeated protests, the Yugoslav police authorities released her. Upon her release, the prison authorities told her not to return to the Soviet Union and not to tell anyone about everything she had experienced in the Yugoslav prison. Polyakova also said that after she was arrested, her father was also summoned and interrogated by the Yugoslav police authorities many times.

    据新华社莫斯科讯　“共青团真理报”今天刊登了苏联女公民、共青团员波尔雅科娃的一封信。信中叙述了她在今年去南斯拉夫探望父亲时被南斯拉夫当局无理监禁六十八天并被审问的经过。
    波尔雅科娃在信中指出，她的父亲原是居住在苏联的南斯拉夫政治侨民，后来去西班牙参加保卫西班牙共和国的斗争，随后就回南斯拉夫工作。她在今年1月间去南斯拉夫探望父亲。在探望父亲以后，3月间，她在贝尔格莱德设法回国时在旅馆中被南斯拉夫警察当局逮捕入狱。在监禁期间，南斯拉夫警察当局不准她和苏联驻南斯拉夫大使馆取得联系，并且对她进行了许多次审问，要她说出到南斯拉夫的目的以及对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的看法。他们还威胁她，要她留在南斯拉夫。
    波尔雅科娃说，经过她多次的抗议，南斯拉夫警察当局才释放了她。在释放时，监狱当局要她不要回到苏联，并且要她对任何人都不要谈出她在南斯拉夫监狱中经过的一切情形。波尔雅科娃还说，在她被逮捕以后，她的父亲也曾被南斯拉夫警察当局多次传去审问。
