Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting, after passing the Arab nations' proposal at the afternoon session on the 21st, proceeded to discuss the Credentials Committee's report.

This committee recognized the credentials of the Chiang Kai-shek elements, who illegally usurp the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and groundlessly and arbitrarily questioned the credentials of the Hungarian People's Republic delegation.

The Indian representative, speaking on the issue, said that he would support the adoption of the Credentials Committee's report but had reservations regarding the Chinese representation and the committee's views on the Hungarian delegation. He stated that India's position on these issues was well known.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Sik András emphasized that the Credentials Committee had exceeded its authority by raising reservations about the Hungarian delegation, as the delegation's credentials met all the prescribed requirements.

Soviet representative Sobolev, in his speech, drew attention to the issue of the representation of those who illegally occupy China's seat in the United Nations General Assembly in violation of the Charter. He said that those who have usurped China's seat in the United Nations are by no means representatives of great China but merely agents of a bankrupt political clique eking out an existence under the protection of the U.S. military. According to the United Nations Charter, only the government of the People's Republic of China can represent China in the United Nations General Assembly and other United Nations bodies.

The Soviet representative then denounced the United States' consistent obstruction of resolving the issue of Chinese representation, stating that the General Assembly should immediately eliminate the abnormal situation regarding Chinese representation and restore the legitimate representative rights of the People's Republic of China.

Sobolev further condemned the United States for engaging in conspiracies and coercing the Credentials Committee to express doubts about the validity of the credentials issued to the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic by its legitimate government. He said that these U.S. representatives' schemes proved that the United States was unwilling to abandon its attempts to use the United Nations to cover up its interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Sobolev concluded by saying that, in order to express our consistent and unchanging attitude towards China's representation in the United Nations and the credentials of the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic, the Soviet delegation, while voting in favor of approving the report on the credentials of the delegations, deemed it necessary to state its attitude to the member states of the United Nations General Assembly.

U.S. representative Lodge then spoke. His speech showed that the United States was the true architect of the United Nations General Assembly Credentials Committee's report.

The Burmese representative emphasized that his delegation did not recognize the credentials of the Chiang Kai-shek elements.

The Indonesian representative said that he voted in favor of approving the Credentials Committee's report, but the Indonesian government believes that only the government of the People's Republic of China can enjoy representation in the United Nations.

Representatives from the United Arab Republic, Nepal, Ceylon, and Cambodia made similar statements.

Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Albania lodged strong protests against the discrimination against the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic.

The committee's report was passed by seventy-one votes. The Hungarian delegation voted against it.

The UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session then adjourned.

　　联大紧急会议通过全权证书委员会报告
    苏联等国代表斥美国非法剥夺我代表权
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约22日讯：联合国大会紧急会议在21日下午会议上通过了阿拉伯国家提案以后接着讨论了全权证书委员会的报告。
    这个委员会承认非法窃据中华人民共和国政府在联合国的席位的蒋介石分子的全权证书，并且毫无理由地完全任意地怀疑匈牙利人民共和国代表团的全权证书。
    印度代表就这个问题发言说，他将赞成通过全权证书委员会的报告，但是，在关于中国代表权以及在委员会对匈牙利代表团的看法方面有保留。他说，印度在这些问题上的立场是大家都清楚知道的。
    匈牙利外交部长西克·安得烈强调说，全权证书委员会对匈牙利代表团提出保留越出了自己的权限，因为匈牙利代表团的全权证书符合规定的全部要求。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中提请注意违反宪章在联合国大会上非法占据中国席位的那些人的代表权的问题。他说在联合国窃据中国席位的那些人，决不是伟大中国的代表，而只不过是在美国军队保护下苟延残喘的破产的政客集团的代理人。根据联合国宪章，在联合国大会以及在联合国的其他机构能够代表中国的，只有中华人民共和国政府。
    苏联代表接着斥责了美国一贯阻挠解决中国代表权问题的立场，并且说，大会应当立即消除在中国代表权问题上的不正常情况，恢复中华人民共和国的合法代表权利。
    索波列夫接着又斥责美国玩弄阴谋诡计，挟持全权证书委员会对匈牙利人民共和国合法政府颁发给它的代表团的全权证书的有效性表示怀疑。他说，美国代表们的这些阴谋证明，美国不肯放弃利用联合国来掩护它干涉其他国家内政的企图。索波列夫最后说，为了表示我们对中国在联合国的代表权以及对匈牙利人民共和国代表团代表资格的态度是一贯不变的，苏联代表团在投票赞成批准关于代表团的代表资格的报告的同时，认为有必要对联合国大会会员国陈述自己这种态度。
    美国代表洛奇接着发言。他的发言表明，美国是联合国大会全权证书委员会报告的真正策划者。
    缅甸代表强调说，他的代表团不承认蒋介石分子的代表资格。
    印度尼西亚代表说，他投票赞成批准全权证书委员会的报告，但是印度尼西亚政府认为，只有中华人民共和国政府才能在联合国享有代表权。
    阿拉伯联合共和国、尼泊尔、锡兰、柬埔寨的代表作了同样的声明。
    捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的代表对歧视中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国一事提出坚决的抗议。
    委员会的报告以七十一票通过。匈牙利代表团投了反对票。
    联大紧急特别会议到此闭幕。
