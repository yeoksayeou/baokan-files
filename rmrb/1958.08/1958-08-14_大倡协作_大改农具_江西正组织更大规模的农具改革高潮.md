　　Vigorously Advocate Collaboration, Radically Reform Farm Tools
　　Jiangxi is Organizing a Larger-Scale Upsurge in Farm Tool Reform
　　(Our dispatch) Nanchang - What are the main problems currently existing in farm tool reform in Jiangxi Province? The reporter recently interviewed the person in charge of Jiangxi Province's agricultural leadership department on this issue.
　　The person in charge said that since last winter, Jiangxi has invented and created a total of 10,580 various farm tools so far, and more than 2 million pieces have been promoted. Farm tool reform has made considerable achievements, but according to the spirit and requirements of the General Line, it is still necessary to work hard and especially hard. Currently, there are several urgent problems that need to be resolved:
　　1. The leadership cannot keep up with the development of the situation, and the promotion of farm tools cannot keep up with the development of inventions and creations. To this day, although many special districts and counties have established farm tool reform leading bodies, there is no one specifically responsible for leadership and grasping it to the end. Generally, they only organize and call for action at the beginning, and then let it go after a high tide has formed, resulting in many inventions and creations but few promotions. Some very good farm tools that have been created have not been vigorously organized and promoted; some have been promoted to some extent, but due to technical problems encountered during use, or conflicts with the usage habits of the masses, they have been put aside again; some farm tools are close to successful trial production, but because there is no special organization to coordinate and help solve the final hurdle, they cannot be promoted. For example, there are more than 50 kinds of rice transplanters created in various parts of the province, and there is a common problem of rice seedlings being submerged and uneven seedling distribution. Because there is no organized collaboration to jointly study and solve this problem, less than 1,000 units have been promoted throughout the province so far.
　　2. Some areas, seeing that the province plans to produce a batch of tractors this year, have developed the idea of ​​underestimating small farm tools and waiting for mechanization, mistakenly thinking that: mechanization will be achieved soon, and it is superfluous to engage in small farm tools. Xin建 (Xinjian), 玉山 (Yushan), 铅山 (Qianshan) and other counties sent people to the Industry Department and the Agriculture Department to sit and wait for tractors, but the double-wheeled double-shared plows accumulated in their hands were not promoted, and farm tool reform was not carried out on a large scale.
　　3. Due to the lack of good cooperation from the handicraft manufacturing departments, the farm tools manufactured by the ironware cooperatives are all made of iron, and the farm tools manufactured by the woodwork cooperatives are all made of wood. Many of the improved harrow shafts and harrow teeth manufactured by woodwork cooperatives are made of wood, which is not only easily damaged, but also results in poor tillage quality. The seat and harrow frame of the disc harrow manufactured by the Xingzi County Ironware Cooperative are all made of iron, each weighing 300 catties, which is inconvenient to use and transport, and wastes a lot of iron.
　　4. Some factories undertaking the manufacture of farm tools are not interested in manufacturing small farm tools. This year, it was originally planned that factories would manufacture 70,000 threshing machines and new-style waterwheels, but now the factories only undertake 11,000 units.
　　The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is studying solutions and measures to address the above problems, and is preparing to organize a new and larger-scale upsurge in farm tool reform. It has also been initially determined that efforts will be made to basically realize semi-mechanization of agriculture throughout the province this year, and all farm tools that can be fitted with ball bearings will be fitted with ball bearings.

### 大倡协作　大改农具　江西正组织更大规模的农具改革高潮

　　大倡协作　大改农具
　　江西正组织更大规模的农具改革高潮
    本报讯　目前江西省在农具改革中存在哪些主要问题？记者最近就这一问题访问了江西省农业领导部门的负责人。
    负责人说，自去冬以来，江西至今共发明创造各种农具一万零五百八十件，已推广了二百多万件，农具改革取得了不小的成绩，但是根据总路线的精神和要求来检查，还需要大干、特干一翻。在目前有这样几个急需要解决的：
    一、领导跟不上形势的发展，农具推广工作跟不上创造发明的发展。至今，许多专、县虽然成立了农具改革领导机构，却没有专人负责领导、一抓到底。一般是在开始时组织一下，号召一下，形成高潮后就放任自流了，以致发明创造多，推广使用少。有些创造出来的很好的农具，也没有大力组织推广；有的虽然推广一些，由于使用中又碰到技术问题，或者与群众使用习惯有矛盾，又被搁置了下来；有的农具接近试制成功，因为没有专门机构组织协作来帮助解决最后一道难关，使得无法进行推广。例如：全省各地创制的插秧机有五十余种，普遍存在有漫秧和分秧不匀的问题，由于没有组织协作共同研究来解决这个问题，至今全省推广的还不到一千部。
    二、部分地区由于看到今年全省计划生产一批拖拉机，便产生轻视小农具，等待机械化的思想，错误地认为：很快就要机械化了，搞小农具多此一举。新建、玉山、铅山等县派人上工业厅、农业厅坐等拖拉机，但积存在手里的双轮双铧犁却没有推广，农具改革也没有大搞起来。
    三、由于手工业制造部门没有很好配合进行协作，造成：铁业社制造的农具全是铁的，木器业社制造的农具全是木的。许多木器社制造的改良耙轴、耙齿都是木的，不仅容易损坏，耕作质量也很差。星子县铁器社制造的盘耙的座位、耙架全是铁的，每个三百斤重，使用、运输都不方便，又浪费了许多铁。
    四、部分承担制造农具的工厂对制造小农具不感兴趣。今年原计划工厂制造七万部打谷机和新式水车，现在工厂只承担一万一千部。
    中共江西省委正针对上述问题研究解决的办法和措施，着手组织一个新的、规模更大的农具改革高潮。并已初步确定：力争今年内全省农业基本实现半机械化，能安装滚珠轴承的农具全部装上滚珠轴承。　（刘光辉）
