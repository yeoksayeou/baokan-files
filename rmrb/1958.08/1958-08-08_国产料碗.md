    Domestic Material Bowls
    The Shaoxing Porcelain Factory in Zhejiang Province has recently successfully trial-produced "material bowls" for the silk reeling industry.
    The "material bowls" used in our country have always been imported from Japan. The successful trial production of material bowls by this factory means that even if Nobusuke Kishi of Japan sabotages the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, it will not be able to hinder the development of our silk reeling industry. The factory has now accepted orders from Hangzhou and will produce them in large quantities in the future. (Chen Songcai)

    国产料碗
    浙江省绍兴磁厂最近试制成功缫丝工业用的“料碗”。
    我国使用的“料碗”，一向从日本进口，这个厂试制料碗成功，日本岸信介破坏中日贸易协定，也不能阻挠我国缫丝工业的发展了。现在这个厂已经接受杭州订货，今后将大量生产。  （陈松财）
