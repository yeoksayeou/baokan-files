　　A Piece of Dog Meat
　　Worker at Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory, Yang Yuzong
　　When the Japanese devils were here, we were beaten and scolded all day long. After one year passed, we looked forward to the next, hoping for the day when we could eat a fragrant meal of fatty pork and white flour dumplings. Back then, eating meat and dumplings was something we could only dream of, and after a while, we couldn't even dream about it anymore.
　　In the factory, people often started beating dogs, though no one knew why. As soon as we heard that dogs were going to be beaten, everyone got excited. Some of us found sticks ourselves, some borrowed door bolts, and those who couldn't borrow anything just grabbed a brick. When we saw a yellow dog, we would shout and chase after it, beating it until it barked and ran wildly. Someone said, "I wouldn't be afraid of a dog even if it were stronger." I asked, "Why?" He said, "You wouldn't understand, it doesn't have the Japanese to back it up!"
　　When we caught a dog, we would skin it, stew it until it was cooked, and eat our fill. Once, a few of us agreed to beat a dog after the night shift. When we brought the dog back, the big workshop was as lively as if it were the New Year, and everyone was happy. Ji Liancheng put the piece of dog meat he had been given under two bowls, as if he was afraid of flies, and placed it on a high board, making the room stink terribly. Unexpectedly, around two o'clock in the afternoon, when people were sleeping soundly, the traitor Ji (Ji Xiangquan) heard people arguing about the dog meat and brought two fake policemen along with him in a threatening manner. As soon as he entered the big workshop, he shouted, "Who the hell has dog meat here?" Before anyone could understand, Ji kicked the door so hard it made a loud noise, waking up the sleeping people. Everyone was dumbfounded and didn't say a word. Ji Liancheng's bowls on the high board weren't covered tightly, and the piece of dog meat was visible. Ji glared with eyes as big as bull's eggs, pointed at the bowl and said, "Whose dog meat is this? Speak up! Speak up, damn it, will you speak up?" As he spoke, he raised his stick, ready to hit someone. Like everyone else in the room, I didn't want to say it was Ji Liancheng's. At that moment, we heard a worker named Zhang screaming like a ghost from being beaten. Ji Liancheng couldn't bear it any longer and came out to admit that the dog meat was his. As a result, he was severely beaten by Ji, who forced him to throw the bowl and the dog meat into the latrine. When people in other rooms heard about this, they panicked and threw their dog meat into the latrine as well.
　　This time, everyone beat a dog for nothing, not only did they not get to eat anything, but they also got a belly full of anger.

### 一块狗肉

　　一块狗肉
　　天津棉纺五厂工人　杨玉宗
    日本鬼子在的时候，我们终日挨打受骂。过了这个年，又盼望那个年，盼着什么时候能吃到一顿喷香的肥猪肉和白面饺子。当时吃肉吃饺子只能在梦里吃到，日子久了，连这样的梦也做不出来了。
    在厂里，人们也不知道为什么常常打起狗来。只要一听说要打狗，劲儿都来了，我们有的自己找了棍子，也有的借了门闩，还有的没借到东西就拿块砖头，见到一条黄狗，就连喊带打跑过去，打得狗乱叫乱窜。有人说：“狗再厉害点我也不怕。”我问：“为嘛？”他说：“你哪懂得这个，它没有日本人给撑腰哇！”
    抓到了狗，就剥了皮炖熟了，吃个痛快。有一回，我们几个人约好了，下了夜班就打狗。打来了狗，闹得大工房里像是过太平年似的，大家都高高兴兴。季连成把分得的一块狗肉用两个碗合扣着，好像怕苍蝇叮，放在高板上，弄得屋内腥臭味实在是够呛。不料到了下午两点多钟，人们睡得正香甜的时候，汉奸大褂季（季相权）听到了大家为狗肉吵架，就带来了两个伪警察气势汹汹地来了。一进大工房他就喝道：“谁他妈的放着狗肉了？”还没等人听清楚，大褂季一脚将门踢得山响，惊醒了熟睡的人们，大家目瞪口呆地不作声。季连成放在高板上的碗，没有盖严露出了那块狗肉。大褂季瞪得眼睛像牛蛋一样大，指着那碗说：“这是谁的狗肉？说！说！他妈的你们说不说？”说着就拿着棍子想打人。我和同屋里的人们一样，谁也不愿意说是季连成的。这时候，就听到一个姓张的工友被打得鬼叫一样，季连成实在忍不住就走出来承认狗肉是他自己的。这么一来他就被大褂季毒打了一顿，强逼他将碗和狗肉一起扔进了茅坑里。别屋里的人听到后，也慌慌张张地都把狗肉扔进茅房坑里去了。
    这回，大伙白打了一场狗，不光什么也没吃上，还惹了一肚子的火气。
