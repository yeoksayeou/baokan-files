　　The West Wind Howls, Fallen Leaves Fly
    Economic Crisis Continues to Deepen in the US, UK, and Japan
　　United States: Large numbers of workers laid off
    United Kingdom: Production declines, exports decrease
    Japan: Crisis penetrates into rural areas
    Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 24th: "Fortune Magazine" published an article by Bell on the 24th, analyzing the impact of the current US economic recession on residents.
    Bell wrote that the 1958 recession has swept across all sectors of the US economy to varying degrees, and it has certain characteristics. The current recession is particularly hard on industrial workers. Workers are being laid off in large numbers and very quickly; in the steel industry, 33% to 39% of all production workers have been laid off.
    The author pointed out that the young, unskilled, and semi-skilled workers are the first to suffer as a result of the recession. He pointed out that in May, about one in six unskilled workers was unemployed; one in eight semi-skilled workers was unemployed; and one in eleven skilled workers was unemployed.
    The author then introduced the situation of young workers in the Fairless Hills worker village (Pennsylvania), established by "United States Steel Corporation." Many young people came here from impoverished areas, hoping for unlimited prosperity, but their hopes were dashed. Of the four thousand three hundred production and repair workers in that factory, one thousand two hundred were laid off, and nearly two thousand four hundred were unable to work full workdays at the end of May.
    The author continued that Gary (Indiana), a city with a population of 170,000, is another example where the impact of the recession can be clearly seen. Of the thirty-nine thousand metallurgical workers in Gary and the surrounding area, more than ten thousand have been laid off, most of them since last November. Another 20,000 workers are working in enterprises where they can only work three or four days a week.
    Bell said that unemployed youth are leaving the city in droves to enlist in the army. The right to receive unemployment benefits is only available to those who have lived in the city for three years. As for the rest, the government is paying to send them back to their places of origin.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 25th: A grim outlook for the British economy can be seen from a report released today by the British government's Council on Prices, Productivity and Incomes.
    The report predicts that production in Britain is likely to decline in the coming months; the current balance of payments situation will worsen; there will be an unfavorable trend in gold and dollar reserves; unemployment, although it reached its highest level since the war in July this year, will continue to increase in 1959; capital investment is likely to decrease further; the volume of exports will continue to decline; and consumption is likely to decrease.
    One of the main conclusions of the report is that the amount of wage increases next year must be even smaller than this year.
    The committee made the same conclusion in its first report, published in February this year, that wage growth should be restricted more strictly. It is expected that the current report, like the first report, will provoke opposition from workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: Tokyo dispatch: The "Japan Economic News" recently stated that the decline in Japanese agricultural product prices indicates that the economic crisis has penetrated into rural areas.
    The newspaper said that the price index for agricultural and forestry products in June this year fell by 2.2% compared to the same period last year, due to the decline in prices of livestock products and vegetables.
    The newspaper pointed out that the reason for the decline in agricultural product prices is due to the economic crisis that has lowered the level of urban consumption and the surplus of products.

    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社纽约24日讯：“幸福杂志”24日刊载了贝尔的一篇文章，分析目前美国经济衰退对居民的影响。
    贝尔写道，1958年的衰退在不同程度上席卷了美国经济的一切部门，它具有某些特点。目前的衰退对产业工人的打击特别厉害。工人被大批地解雇而且解雇得很快；在钢铁工业部门解雇了全体生产工人的33％到39％。
    作者指出，衰退的结果，首先受害的是青年工人、不熟练工人和半熟练工人。他指出，在5月份，每六个不熟练工人中间大约有一个没有工作；每八个半熟练工人有一个人失业；熟练工人中间每十一人有一个人失业。
    作者接着介绍了“美国钢铁公司”所建立的费尔勒斯—希尔斯工人村（宾夕法尼亚州）的青年工人的状况。有很多青年人从贫困的地区来到这里，他们希望在这里将有无限的繁荣，但是他们的希望落空了。在那个厂四千三百名生产工人和修配工人中有一千二百人被解雇，有将近二千四百人在5月底不能作全工作日的工作。
    作者接着写道，拥有十七万人的海里市（印第安纳州）是另一个可以明显看出衰退影响的例子。在海里和邻近地区的三万九千名冶金工人中间有一万多人被解雇，并且大多数人从去年11月解雇。还有二万名工人在一周只能工作三四天的企业里工作。
    贝尔说，失业青年离开城市成群地到征兵站去参加军队。领取失业救济金的权利只有那些在城市居住三年的人才能享有。至于其余的人，他们都由政府出钱送回原籍。
    新华社伦敦25日电　从英国政府的价格、生产率和工资问题委员会今天发表的一份报告中，可以看出英国经济的黯淡前景。
    这份报告预料，英国今后几个月的生产很可能下降；目前的支付平衡情况将恶化；黄金和美元储备将发生不利的趋势；失业人数虽然在今年7月份已经达到战后以来的最高数字，但是在1959年仍将增加；资本投资很可能还要减少；出口的数量将继续下降；消费量大概会减少。
    这份报告得出的主要结论之一就是：明年工资增加的数量必须比今年还要小。
    这个委员会在今年2月发表的第一份报告中也提出了要更严格限制工资增长的同样结论。人们预料，目前这份报告将同第一份报告一样，会引起工人的反对。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：“日本经济新闻”最近说，日本农产品价格的下降表明，经济危机已经渗透到农村。
    这家报纸说，今年6月的农林业产品价格指数比去年同一时期下降了2.2％，这是由于畜产品和蔬菜类的跌价造成的。
    报纸指出，农产品跌价的原因是由于经济危机使城市的消费水平降低以及产品过剩。
