　　The People's Daily raised the issue of eliminating alternate bearing in fruit trees in the "Everyone Raises Questions, Everyone Answers" column on July 10th. Generally speaking, although the yields of most apple and pear orchards in China (these two types of fruit trees have the largest cultivation area in China) have greatly increased compared to the past, the phenomenon of alternate bearing still exists. Therefore, some people believe that fruit trees have an alternate bearing habit, which is not easy to change and is their nature. However, this is not always the case. As far as I know, some orchards no longer have the "off-year" phenomenon. The pear orchard of the Houliangshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changli had extremely low yields before and in the early days of liberation. In 1950, advanced horticultural techniques (pruning, fertilization, etc.) were adopted, and the yield greatly increased, with basically no "off-year". The average yield per mu of the apple orchard of our Hebei Provincial Institute of Pomology (each mu is calculated based on thirteen fruit trees, with seven varieties: Meixia, Golden Crown, Marshal, Hongyu, Chunlu, Bailong, Guoguang) was: 2460 jin in 1951, 3946 jin in 1952, 3200 jin in 1953, 5468 jin in 1954, 3752 jin in 1955, and 5684 jin in 1956. The phenomenon of alternate bearing was also serious, but the yield of some plants of certain varieties was still stable. There were a total of 48 Meixia trees in the entire orchard, of which 8 basically had a good harvest every year. Their average yield per tree was: 173.5 jin in 1952, 224 jin in 1953, 409.5 jin in 1954, 432 jin in 1955, and 420 jin in 1956; there were a total of 60 Golden Crown trees, of which 9 had a large harvest every year. Their average yield per tree was: 213 jin in 1951, 339 jin in 1952, 388.6 jin in 1953, 463.3 jin in 1954, 447 jin in 1955, and 573.7 jin in 1956. From this, it can be seen that alternate bearing in fruit trees is not their inherent nature, but rather the different results reflected by the influence of planting fruit trees in certain areas and different management practices. In other words, each fruit tree species and variety has different requirements for environmental conditions. If we can master their characteristics and strengthen technical work such as fertilization, pruning, and pest control, we can eliminate the "off-year" and increase yield.

### 果树隔年结果现象可以改变

　　果树隔年结果现象可以改变
    人民日报7月10日在“大家出题目，大家来回答”一栏内，提出消灭果树隔年结果现象的问题。一般讲来，我国大多数的苹果和梨树园（这两种果树在我国栽培面积最广）虽然产量比过去大有提高，但大小年现象仍然存在。因此，有人认为果树是有隔年结果习性的，而且不易改变，是它的本性。但是事实也不尽是这样。据我所知，有一些果园已经没有小年现象，昌黎后两山农业生产合作社的梨园，在解放前和解放初期产量是极低的，1950年采用了先进园艺技术（修剪、施肥等），产量大大的提高，基本上没有小年了。我们河北省果树研究所苹果园的平均每亩产量（每亩按十三株果树计算，有七个品种：美夏、金冠、元帅、红玉、醇露、白龙、国光）：1951年产二千四百六十斤，1952年产三千九百四十六斤，1953年产三千二百斤，1954年产五千四百六十八斤，1955年产三千七百五十二斤，1956年产五千六百八十四斤，大小年现象也是严重，但其中某些品种的某些植株，产量还是稳定的。全园美夏品种共四十八株，其中有八株基本上年年都是丰收，它们的平均株产是：1952年产一百七十三点五斤，1953年产二百二十四斤，1954年产四百零九点五斤，1955年产四百三十二斤，1956年产四百二十斤；金冠品种共六十株，其中有九株年年都是大年，它们平均株产量是：1951年产二百一十三斤，1952年产三百三十九斤，1953年产三百八十八点六斤，1954年产四百六十三点三斤，1955年产四百四十七斤，1956年产五百七十三点七斤。由此可见，果树隔年结果不是其本性，而是果树栽在一定的地区，以及不同的管理的影响反应出来的不同结果，也就是说各果树种和品种对环境条件要求不一，我们如能掌握了它们的特点，加强施肥、剪枝、除虫等技术工作，就能消灭小年，提高产量。
