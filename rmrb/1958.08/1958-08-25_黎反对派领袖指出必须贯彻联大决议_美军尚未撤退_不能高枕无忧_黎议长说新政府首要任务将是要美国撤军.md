Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 23rd: Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam said yesterday, commenting on the Arab proposal, that after the United Nations General Assembly passed this proposal, U.S. troops should withdraw from Lebanon immediately and without conditions. He also demanded that the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon also withdraw "without delay."

Salam said that Hammarskjöld's interpretation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution should not exceed its actual meaning. Salam said that he should not intend to establish a United Nations representative in Lebanon in the form he suggested in his past reports to the United Nations, and should not link this to what U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said in his speech to the United Nations on August 21 about "stationing" United Nations personnel in the Middle East.

He expressed that Dulles' interpretation of the proposal in his speech and Hammarskjöld's report aroused his vigilance, saying: "We should not be complacent."

Another opposition leader, Yafi, said on the same day that he hoped that "the passage in the resolution concerning the United Nations Secretary-General's mission in the Middle East will not open the door to misinterpretation or bargaining to delay the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan."

Yafi expressed his pleasure with the content of the proposal that requires each member state of the United Nations not to interfere in the affairs of other countries, but to respect the dignity and independence of other countries. He said that this article is a positive response to the Arab countries' accusations against certain Western powers for interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 23rd: According to local newspapers today, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Oseiran made a statement to reporters from the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency on the 22nd. When talking about the Arab countries' proposal unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session, he pointed out that all Arab countries have reached an agreement on the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Therefore, these foreign troops must withdraw from Lebanon.

Speaking about the domestic situation in Lebanon, Oseiran pointed out that if Chamoun does not resign as president before September 24, the current crisis in Lebanon will never be resolved. He said that after Chamoun steps down on September 24, Lebanon will form a coalition government. Undoubtedly, the first task of this government will be to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon.

Speaking about the relationship between Lebanon and the United Arab Republic, Oseiran said that the relationship between the two countries will continue to be friendly in the future, because this is in the interests of both countries.

　　黎反对派领袖指出必须贯彻联大决议
    美军尚未撤退　不能高枕无忧
    黎议长说新政府首要任务将是要美国撤军
    新华社贝鲁特23日电　黎巴嫩反对派领袖、前总理萨拉姆昨天在评论阿拉伯提案时说，在联合国大会通过了这一提案以后，美国军队应该毫无条件地立即撤出黎巴嫩。他还要求联合国驻黎巴嫩的观察团也“毫不拖延地”撤走。
    萨拉姆说，哈马舍尔德对联合国大会决议的解释不应该超过它实际的含义。萨拉姆说，他不应该打算建立像他过去向联合国提出的报告中所建议的那种形式的驻黎巴嫩联合国代表，并且不应该把这一点同美国国务卿杜勒斯8月21日在联合国发言中所谈到的在中东“派驻”联合国人员的说法联系起来。
    他表示，杜勒斯在发言中对这一提案的解释和哈马舍尔德的报告引起了他的警惕，他说：“我们不应当高枕无忧。”
    另一个反对派领袖雅非在同一天表示，希望“决议中关于联合国秘书长在中东的使命那段话不致于为进行错误解释或讨价还价以拖延美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退打开方便之门。”
    雅非对提案中关于要求联合国每个成员国不要干涉它国事务，而要尊重它国的尊严和独立的内容表示高兴。他说，这一条是有利于阿拉伯国家对某些西方大国干涉阿拉伯国家内政的指控的积极回答。
    新华社索非亚23日电　据此间报纸今天报道：黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰22日向保加利亚通讯社记者发表了谈话。他在谈到联合国大会紧急特别会议一致通过的阿拉伯国家提案时指出，所有阿拉伯国家都就外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦这个问题达成了协议。因而，这些外国军队必须撤出黎巴嫩。
  谈到黎巴嫩的国内局势时，奥塞兰指出，如果夏蒙在9月24日以前不辞去总统职务，黎巴嫩目前的危机就决不会获得解决。他说，夏蒙在9月24日让位以后，黎巴嫩将成立联合政府。无疑，这个政府的第一个任务将是要求外国军队撤出黎巴嫩。
    谈到黎巴嫩和阿拉伯联合共和国的关系问题时，奥塞兰说，这两个国家的关系今后将继续友好，因为这是符合两国的利益的。
