　　"Giving Charcoal in Snowy Weather"
　　Zhao Lu
　　The rapid development of higher education nationwide this year is a good thing. However, a new difficulty has also emerged: the shortage of faculty in some newly established universities. To run universities well, this problem must be solved.
　　How to solve this problem? Absorbing those who have trained and cultivated themselves into scientists and experts in productive labor practice to participate in teaching is one way; relying on self-reliance and cultivating new forces in teaching is another, and also the most important, method. However, relying solely on these two is not enough. In addition, we must rely on existing universities to promote communist spirit and provide strong support to newly established universities. Because existing universities, generally speaking, have a better foundation, more faculty, and are better able to train and promote new faculty, it should be their bounden duty to support newly established brother schools. Shanghai universities have recently transferred a large number of faculty to support newly established brother schools. For the sake of the collective interests of socialism and the early realization of the socialist cultural revolution, they are willing to give strong support, "giving charcoal in snowy weather." This is the spirit of communism and deserves great promotion.
　　However, some people say, "They are establishing new universities there, and we are also increasing our tasks, which is not easy! Supporting others will create difficulties for ourselves!" Yes, the enrollment tasks of existing universities have increased, and the number of faculty also needs to increase. However, in comparison, the conditions of existing universities are much better than those of newly established universities that start from scratch. The question is, what attitude do we take towards this upsurge of cultural revolution? Do we become dwarfs in the face of difficulties? Or do we muster the courage to conquer difficulties? After Shanghai universities transferred a batch of faculty to support newly established brother schools, although difficulties arose, they were not afraid of difficulties. They adopted methods such as tapping potential, adjusting teaching plans, expanding classes, appropriately increasing teachers' teaching hours, and organizing teachers from various schools to help each other with part-time teaching to solve the problems. In this way, difficulties are no longer difficulties. On the contrary, difficulties have promoted a new leap forward in schools under the new situation!
　　Building the edifice of socialism is the common and lofty cause of 600 million people. Every individual and every unit must cooperate and support each other in this lofty cause, moving forward in unison, as if one, in order to jointly advance and build the edifice of socialism as soon as possible. Self-reliance, starting from scratch, overcoming all difficulties, and running universities, this revolutionary spirit is worth great promotion, and this spirit of hard struggle is glorious. However, it is also glorious to do everything possible to help others, finally overcome difficulties, and run socialist education in a way that is both numerous and good. In any work, the parochialism of only caring about oneself and not caring about others is wrong. If one's own unit or region has something that other units or regions do not have but urgently need, one should actively support them; moreover, even if supporting other units and regions creates certain difficulties for oneself, one should also actively support them and overcome one's own difficulties with the spirit of self-reliance. This is the display of the red flag of the proletariat and the comprehensive promotion of the communist spirit, which is needed not only for cultural and educational work, but also for all other socialist construction undertakings.

　　“雪中送炭”
　　赵路
    全国高等教育今年有了飞跃的发展，这是一件好事。但是，一个新的困难也随之出现了，这就是一些新建的高等学校的师资不足。为了办好高等学校，必须解决这个问题。
    怎样来解决这个问题？吸收那些在生产劳动实践中把自己锻炼和培养成为科学家和专家的人参加教学工作，这是一种办法；依靠自力更生，在教学中培养新生力量，这是又一种办法，也是最主要的方法。但是，只靠这两条还是不够的。除此以外，还必须依靠原有高等学校发扬共产主义精神，给新建高等学校大力支援。因为原有高等学校，一般说来，基础比较好，师资比较多，培养和提拔新的师资也比较容易，支援新建的兄弟学校应当是义不容辞的事情。上海高等学校最近已经抽调了大批师资支援新建的兄弟学校。为了社会主义的集体利益，为了社会主义文化革命的提早实现，他们愿意大力支援，“雪中送炭”，这是共产主义的精神，值得大大发扬。
    可是，也有人说，他们那里新建高等学校，我们这里也增加任务，并不轻松呀！支援别人就使自己产生了困难了呀！是的，原有高等学校的招生任务增加了，师资也需要增加。但是，比较起来，原有高等学校的条件比白手起家新建的高等学校毕竟要好得多。问题在于我们对待这种文化革命高涨的形势，采取什么态度，是在困难面前成为侏儒呢？还是鼓起勇气去征服困难呢？上海市高等学校抽调一批师资去支援新建兄弟学校以后，虽然发生了困难，可是，他们并没有怕困难。他们采用挖掘潜力，调整教学计划，扩大班级，适当增加教师授课时数，以及组织各校教师互助兼课等办法来解决。这样一来，困难也就不成为困难了，相反地，困难却促成了学校在新形势下新的跃进！
    建设社会主义的大厦，是六亿人民的共同的崇高事业。每个人、每个单位在这个崇高的事业中都要互相协作，互相支援，步伐整齐、宛如一体，才能共同前进，才能把社会主义大厦早日建成。自力更生、白手起家，克服一切困难，办起了高等学校，这种革命干劲值得大大提倡，这种艰苦奋斗的精神，是光荣的。但是，为了帮助别人想尽一切办法，终于战胜了困难，把社会主义教育事业办得又多又好，这也是光荣的。在任何工作中，那种只顾自己，不顾别人的本位主义思想是错误的。本单位、本地区有的，而别的单位或地区没有而又迫切需要的，就应该积极支援；不仅如此，支援别的单位和地区使自己产生某些困难的，也要积极支援，并且以自力更生的精神来克服自己的困难。这才是无产阶级的红旗招展，共产主义精神的全面发扬，不仅对文化教育工作来说，需要这样；对其它一切社会主义建设事业来说，都需要这样。
