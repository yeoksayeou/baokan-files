    (Reported by our newspaper) Since the beginning of summer, Xin Xing Village in Li County, Hebei Province, has continued to launch a concentrated campaign to eliminate the remaining "four pests." They have completely achieved the "eight no's" and "eight cleanness'."

    Because this village insists on regular "four pests" elimination and hygiene work, very few mosquitoes and flies can be found in the entire village, and not a single sparrow can be seen, thoroughly achieving the "eight no's" and "eight cleanness'." At the same time, new content for hygiene has been added to the summer "four pests" elimination offensive. The village has established a maternity hospital and a general hospital, and each production team has a health clinic equipped with a first-aid kit. By mid-July, this village had become a "disease-free village."

    Currently, the village has implemented unified waste management. All twenty-five production teams have dedicated sanitation workers, and the whole commune has organized eight cleaning and manure-collecting teams. They empty the toilets every day and have built sixteen manure plants outside the village, sealing the manure tightly with mud. A garbage bin is set up for every five households, eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. They have repaired toilets that collapsed after rain. Chicken coops have been rebuilt into three-story structures, with chickens living on the middle level, eggs laid on the top level, and manure accumulating on the bottom level. Now, everyone in the village is involved in sanitation and maintains it regularly. The village has also organized a juvenile rapid fly-catching team, a women's fly-catching team, and sparrow monitoring posts. Everyone carries a fly swatter and strikes down any they see, whether in the fields or at home. Combining production with hygiene, a fifty-four-person professional disinfection team has been established, responsible for preventing and controlling crop pests and regularly inspecting village hygiene and disinfecting. The village is basically rat-free, but every household still sets up rat traps and uses poison. Pig farms and livestock farms have been moved outside the village, with dedicated personnel responsible for regular spraying. Hygiene knowledge education for the masses has been strengthened. The ninety students of Xin Xing Village Red and Expert School attend hygiene class twice a week and spread knowledge to the commune members in the production teams. An inspection and evaluation system has been established, with inspections weekly and evaluations bi-weekly, using moving red flags and white flags. Closely combined with production, sanitation work is deployed in a unified manner. The summer fertilizer accumulation campaign has been combined with the elimination of "four pests," and all weeds in the village have been eliminated, accumulating 68,000 cartloads of fertilizer. The village Party branch committee members and commune management committee members have taken unified responsibility for the production and hygiene of each production team, conducting unified evaluations.
