　　Good Couplet
    Wang Fen, a forty-year-old woman from Shili Pu Village in Dengfeng County, was a "Five Guarantee Household." She was illiterate in the past, but after literacy campaign, she only shook off the title of illiterate a few months ago. She wrote a self-composed couplet on her own door:

    Taking advantage of starlight to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure,
    Borrowing the moonlight to write and read. The horizontal inscription is: Eyes opened.
                      (Cao)

　　好对
    登封县十里铺村一个四十多岁的妇女王芬，是个五保户，过去不识字，经过了扫盲，摘掉文盲帽子才几个月，她就在自家大门上，提笔写了一副自撰的对联：
    趁星光积肥送粪，
    借月亮写字读书。横额是：睁开眼了。
                      （草）
