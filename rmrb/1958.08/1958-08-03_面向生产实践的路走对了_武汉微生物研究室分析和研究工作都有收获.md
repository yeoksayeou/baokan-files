The Path of Serving Production Practice is Correct:
Wuhan Microbiology Research Laboratory Achieves Gains in Analysis and Research

(Our dispatch) Wuhan Microbiology Research Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has achieved preliminary results in research on using microorganisms to serve industrial and agricultural production.

How to make winter compost ferment in a timely manner and stabilize biogas fermentation are urgent problems to be solved in the vast rural areas of Hubei Province. After focusing on production, the Wuhan Microbiology Research Laboratory immediately paid attention to analyzing and researching these two problems. They developed a platform-style composting method that allows the compost pile to maintain appropriate moisture and ventilation, resulting in good compost fermentation. They also buried the biogas digester in the soil, creating a "platform" style compost heap on the ground. Using this compost as a heat source compensates for the heat loss in the biogas digester due to low temperatures. This method can maintain the temperature at around thirty-five degrees Celsius for a long time, solving the problem of biogas fermentation stability in winter. In addition to these two results, significant economic achievements have been made in microbial degumming of cotton stalks and treatment of industrial wastewater containing phenol. For example, in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing phenol, a new strain with a strong ability to decompose phenol has been found, providing an important method for solving urban sewage treatment.

Starting in May of this year, the staff of the Wuhan Microbiology Research Laboratory decided to change their past practice of emphasizing theory over practice and conscientiously implement the Party's policy of linking with production, linking with reality, and linking with the masses. They went deep into industrial and agricultural production departments to conduct research and finally achieved significant results in just over a month. Currently, they are continuing to study the use of microbial degumming methods to solve the utilization of various major wild plant fibers, so that wild plant fibers can be turned into the most beautiful rayon.

The preparatory committee of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences promptly held an on-site meeting to promote their experience. (Yin Ping)

    面向生产实践的路走对了
    武汉微生物研究室分析和研究工作都有收获
    本报讯　中国科学院武汉微生物研究室人员，在研究利用微生物为工农业生产服务方面已取得初步结果。
    如何使冬季堆肥及时发酵、沼气发酵稳定，是湖北省广大农村亟待解决的问题，武汉微生物研究室在面向生产以后，立即注意分析和研究这两个问题。他们研究出一种架台式堆肥法，使肥堆能够保持水分适当和通气，得到良好的堆肥发酵，并把沼气池藏在土壤里，地面上作“架台”式堆肥，用这种堆肥作热源，来补偿沼气池内因气温低散失的热量。这种方法可以使温度长期保持在三十五度左右，解决了沼气冬季发酵稳定性的问题。除这两项已得出结果外，还有具有重大经济意义的棉秆皮微生物脱胶法和含酚工业废水处理问题，都获得了成果，如对含酚工业废水处理上，就已寻获一种具有强分解酚能力的新菌种，为解决城市污水处理提出了重要的方法。
    武汉微生物研究室工作人员，从今年5月份起，决定改变过去重理论轻实践的作法，认真贯彻了党提出的联系生产、联系实际、联系群众的方针，深入到工、农业生产部门进行研究，终于在一个多月时间内就取得了重大的成绩。目前，他们正在继续研究以微生物脱胶方法来解决各种主要野生植物纤维利用问题，使野生植物纤维都能变成最美好的人造纤维。
    中国科学院武汉分院筹委会及时召开现场会议，推广了他们的经验。　（殷平）
