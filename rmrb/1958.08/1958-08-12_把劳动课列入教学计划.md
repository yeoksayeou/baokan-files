Include Labor Courses in the Teaching Plan
He Man

"How are wheat seedlings planted in paddy fields?" A third-year student from the Biology Department of Peking University asked in surprise when he saw others planting seedlings in a paddy field. Some people might be surprised by the surprise of this university student: how could a biology student not recognize seedlings? However, this is indeed true; and there are many similar things.

University students have read many books. From elementary school to university, after counting on fingers, it is more than "ten years of hard study"? But when it comes to practice, they don't even understand the most basic knowledge and become "bookworms."

Today, when the working people are masters of their own affairs, workers and farmers are literate and knowledgeable. They have demonstrated high levels of intelligence, and inventions and creations are emerging one after another. Production records are rising steadily, and writing books and establishing theories are heard of every day. Therefore, "bookworms" appear even more useless in the face of actual production labor. Therefore, it is really necessary to reform teaching, combine education with production labor, and combine theory with practice.

Even so, some students are still reluctant to give up their identity as "bookworms." A student from Northwest University even refused to participate in production labor for the inexplicable reason that "Southerners like to take walks."

It is absolutely necessary for students to accept book knowledge. However, this knowledge is still one-sided for them. Because others have proved this knowledge, but they have not used facts to prove this knowledge. Students should apply this knowledge to production labor, enrich and develop this knowledge from it, and temper and transform their own thinking from production labor. In this way, they will not be "bookworms," but will become new people who have both political consciousness and culture, and who can engage in both mental and physical labor.

Our schools are socialist schools, and they must train laborers who serve socialism. Therefore, in all schools in our country, we must implement the policy of combining education with labor, and we must include production labor as a formal course. Each student must participate in labor for a certain period of time in accordance with regulations.

Yanbian University has done a good job. They have included production labor in the teaching plan and issued each student a labor manual to record their labor achievements. Students work on time and are given points according to their work, just like members of an agricultural cooperative. More work, more points; less work, fewer points; no work, no points. In this way, the teaching system provides a guarantee for students to participate in production labor.

The provisions of the labor manual will be an encouragement to those students who consciously participate in production labor; and it will be a spur to those students who only want to be "bookworms" and only seek five points for book knowledge. Is it better to get five points for "walking" or five points for "labor"? Young students are courageous in accepting the truth. After ideological struggle and practical struggle, they will understand this truth in theory and practice. We will see that the labor manuals of young students are filled with five points.

### 把劳动课列入教学计划

　　把劳动课列入教学计划
　　何满
    “小麦怎么插在水田里？”北京大学生物系三年级的一个学生，看到别人把秧苗插在水田里，这样惊奇地问道。有些人也许要为这个大学生的惊奇而惊奇吧：一个学生物的大学生怎么能认不得秧苗呢？然而，这毕竟是真事；而且，诸如此类的事还很多。
    大学生念了许多书，从小学到大学，前后屈指一算，何止“十载寒窗”？可是一到了实践面前，却连最普通的知识都不懂，成为“书呆子”。
    在劳动人民当家作主的今天，工人、农民已经识字知书，他们发挥了高度的聪明智慧，发明创造层出不穷，生产记录蒸蒸日上，著书立说日有所闻。于是，“书呆子”在生产劳动实际面前显得更是没有用场。因此，教学改革，教育结合生产劳动，理论结合实践，真是非常必要了。
    虽然如此，有些学生却还对“书呆子”的身份留恋不舍，西北大学的一个学生，甚至以“南方人喜欢散步”的莫名其妙的缘由，拒绝参加生产劳动。
    学生接受书本知识是完全必要的。但是，这种知识对于他们还是片面的。因为，人家证明了这种知识，而他们却没有用事实来证明这种知识。学生应当将这些知识应用到生产劳动中去，从中丰富和发展这些知识，并且从生产劳动中锻炼和改造自己的思想面貌。这样，他们就将不会是“书呆子”，而会成为又有政治觉悟又有文化的，既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的新人。
    我们的学校是社会主义性质的学校，它要培养为社会主义服务的劳动者，因此，在我国一切学校中，必须贯彻教育和劳动结合的方针，必须把生产劳动列为正式课程。每个学生必须依照规定参加一定时间的劳动。
    延边大学做得好，他们把生产劳动列入教学计划，并发给每个学生劳动手册，以便记录学生的劳动成绩。学生按时劳动，按工记分，就如同农业合作社的社员一样。多劳动多记分，少劳动少记分，不劳动不记分。这样，就从教学制度上给学生参加生产劳动提供了保证。
    劳动手册的规定，对于那些自觉参加生产劳动的学生来说，会是一种鼓舞；而对于那些只愿做“书呆子”，只求书本知识五分的学生来说，也会是一种鞭策。究竟是让“散步”得个五分，还是让“劳动”得五分呢？青年学生是勇于接受真理的，经过思想斗争和实际斗争，他们在理论上和实践中会懂得这个道理的，我们将会看到青年学生们的劳动手册上都写满了五分。
