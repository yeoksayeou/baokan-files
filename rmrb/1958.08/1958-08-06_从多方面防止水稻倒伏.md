    Preventing Rice Lodging from Multiple Perspectives

    There are many reasons for rice lodging. I would like to introduce some of the measures taken in Guangdong below:

    I. Improve Irrigation and Drainage. "Frequent drainage with shallow irrigation, and timely field drying" is a very important measure to prevent lodging. This method involves shallow irrigation after transplanting to promote seedling recovery and tillering. During the late tillering to jointing stage, take the opportunity to dry the fields two or three times, each time for three or four days, until the field surface shows chicken-claw cracks, then irrigate to moisten it. Then drain and dry again, allowing sunlight to penetrate the soil layer, promoting deep root growth, strengthening the root system and rice stalks, and controlling ineffective tillering. During the heading, flowering, and milk stages, irrigation is carried out to ensure full grains. When the grains are yellow and ripe, the field water is completely drained to dry the field, to prevent lodging. In normal times, drainage should be carried out in time in case of heavy rain.

    II. Reasonable fertilization is another important measure to prevent lodging. When applying the first fertilizer about seven days after transplanting, apply more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers to promote strong seedling development; when applying the second fertilizer about seven days later, apply more potassium fertilizer to make the rice stalks thick, strong, and the fibers well-developed. In addition, some areas have created successful experiences in applying sheep manure and applying phosphate rock powder during rice flowering to prevent lodging. Returning rice straw to the field can also provide a certain amount of potassium silicate, which helps to increase lodging resistance.

    III. Deep plowing and multiple plowing and harrowing can avoid lodging. Generally, deep plowing to a depth of eight inches to one foot is appropriate, so that the roots of the rice seedlings grow deep and firmly, enhancing their resistance to lodging.

    IV. Early transplanting is not only a major measure to increase production, but also has a positive effect on preventing lodging. This year, Guangdong's early rice was transplanted before the Qingming Festival, one solar term earlier than in previous years. This can reduce damage from typhoon strikes and avoid rice planthopper damage during heading and grain filling, improving rice's lodging resistance.

    V. In the long run, selecting good varieties is the fundamental way to prevent lodging. Varieties with thick, stiff stems, short plants, small leaves, and high yields are less prone to lodging. For example, the "Dwarf Sticky" variety being promoted in Guangdong Province has the above characteristics and does not lodge even in the face of a level nine typhoon. Zhou Hanhua, a youth from the Wuhe Second Cooperative in Xinhui County, created a new variety of "Happiness Sticky" by hybridizing rice and sorghum, which also has the characteristics of thick and stiff stalks and developed roots, and does not lodge.

    In addition, Guangdong has also taken certain measures such as tiller pruning, cutting rice tails, and pulling ropes to prevent lodging when lodging is found, which also have certain effects.

    7月10日在这个栏目里读者提出了怎样防止水稻倒伏问题。这里发表了两件读者的回答，同时我们选登了两件新创造消息，一并供参考。

    从多方面防止水稻倒伏
    造成水稻倒伏有多方面的原因，现在，我把广东采取的几种措施介绍在下面：
    一、改善排灌。“勤排浅灌，适时晒田”，是防倒伏的一个非常重要措施。这种办法是在插秧后实行浅水勤灌，促使禾苗回青分蘖。分蘖后期至拔节期便抓紧时机晒田二、三次，每次三、四天，将田面晒得呈鸡爪裂时便放水湿润一下。然后排干再晒，让阳光进入土层，使禾根深生，坚实根系和稻秆，控制无效分蘖。到抽穗扬花和青熟期又进行灌溉，使谷粒饱满，到谷粒黄熟时全部排干田水晒田，以免倒伏。平时遇到大雨，要及时排水。
    二、合理施肥是防止倒伏的另一个重要措施。插秧七天左右施第一次肥时，要多施氮磷钾三种肥料，以促使禾苗发育壮大；再隔七天左右第二次施肥时，要多施钾肥，使禾秆粗壮、坚硬和纤维发达。此外，有些地区还创造了施用羊粪和在水稻扬花时施用磷矿石粉防倒伏的成功经验。稻草回田也可以提一定数量的矽酸钾，有助于增加抗倒伏能力。
    三、深耕和多犁多耙可以避免倒伏。一般以深耕八寸到一尺为宜，使禾苗根部深生扎实，增强抗倒伏能力。
    四、早插不仅是增产的主要措施，对防倒伏也有积极作用。今年广东早稻在清明前插完，比往年提早一个节气。这样可以减轻台风侵袭的损害，和避免抽穗灌浆时稻飞虱为害，提高水稻抗倒伏能力。
    五、从长远来说，选用良种是防止倒伏的根本办法。那些茎秆粗硬、植株短、叶小和产量高的品种就不容易倒伏。如广东省正在推广的“矮仔粘”品种就具有以上特点，即使遇到九级台风也不倒伏。新会县五和二社青年周汉华用水稻与高粱杂交的“幸福粘”新品种，也具有禾秆粗硬、根部发达等特点而不倒伏。
    此外，在发现倒伏现象时，广东各地还有用剪蘖、割禾尾和拉绳防倒等措施，也有一定作用。
