Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 4th: A recent statement from Okura Province Financial Investigator Shimomura stated that since last year, Japan's newly invested production equipment capacity is estimated at 1.58 trillion yen, while the total demand for this newly added production capacity is only about 250 billion yen. The excess production capacity of the new equipment amounts to 1.33 trillion yen.

The situation revealed by this Ministry of Finance official indicates a deepening crisis of overproduction in Japan.

In order to "alleviate" the overproduction crisis, the Kishinobu government has repeatedly ordered various production sectors to reduce production. However, due to the large gap between production and demand, a large amount of inventory is still piling up, and the wholesale prices of goods are declining daily. Recently, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry also plans to use the method of "freezing" products to prevent further price declines and the resulting further chaos in the domestic market. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has decided to "freeze" 50 million square yards of cotton cloth starting from August 15th. Prior to this, Japan's cotton cloth inventory had reached 630 million square yards by mid-July, exceeding the normal inventory by nearly 180 million square yards.

The Kishinobu government once regarded expanding exports as an important means of "rescuing" the crisis. However, the prospects for Japan's foreign exports are also not optimistic. A Paris "International Forum" correspondent in Tokyo wrote in an article not long ago that Japan's exports in any month of 1958 were lower than those of the same month last year, which is the first time in five years. The article also said that Minister of International Trade and Industry Takasaki Tatsunosuke recently announced worriedly that if Japan can export 2.86 billion US dollars (originally planned for 3.15 billion US dollars) within this year, it would be very fortunate, and he even worried that the figure he cited was too optimistic. Obviously, Japan is being affected by the current world economic crisis. In fact, Tokyo feels extremely uneasy about the economic crisis suffered by the United States.

Commenting on the Kishinobu government's measures to increase exports, the reporter said that no one can say what results this series of theoretical measures will have in terms of exports. Pessimists are sure that Japan cannot find a quick solution.

Due to the sharp decline in domestic and foreign demand, Japan's basic industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, has also experienced an unprecedented crisis. According to the announcement of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, as of May, the total amount of orders for the machinery manufacturing industry was 23.38 billion yen, a decrease of 13.1% compared with April, and a decrease of 68.6% compared with the same period last year. The amount of orders for exported machinery has declined particularly sharply due to the large reduction in orders for exported ships. The orders in May decreased by 81.5% compared with April, and by 94.2% compared with the same period last year. The sharp drop in orders for the machinery manufacturing industry means that the oversupply of production equipment will continue to develop.

The economic crisis has brought the suffering of unemployment to Japanese workers. At present, the unemployment situation in Japan is very serious: the number of fully unemployed workers has reached 850,000; from January to May, the number of people receiving unemployment insurance averaged about 400,000 per month, an increase of 45% compared with the same period last year; the number of so-called "streamlined personnel" who have been laid off has increased to twice that of the same period last year; the employment index of odd-job workers from January to April this year has also decreased by 15.1% compared with the same period last year.

Many newly graduated students, after finally finding a job, received "cancellation of employment" or "postponement of employment" notices not long after. Recently, there have been 17,000 such cases in the textile industry alone. The "Japan Economic News" believes that the unemployment situation of Japanese workers will further deteriorate in the future.

### 依附美国经济政策自食恶果  日本生产过剩危机深刻化  岸信介政府束手无策命令削减生产引起大批失业

    依附美国经济政策自食恶果
    日本生产过剩危机深刻化
    岸信介政府束手无策命令削减生产引起大批失业
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本大藏省财务调查官下村最近说，自从去年度以来日本新投资的生产设备能力估计共为一万五千八百亿日元，而这一期间对新增加的生产设备能力的全部需要却只有二千五百亿日元左右，新增设备的生产能力的过剩部分为一万三千三百亿日元。
    大藏省官员透露的这一情况表明日本生产过剩危机的深刻化。
    为了“缓和”生产过剩危机，岸信介政府一再命令各生产部门缩减生产，但是，由于生产和需求之间相距悬殊，库存商品还是大量积压，商品的批发价格日益下降。最近，通商产业省又计划用“冻结”产品的办法来防止物价继续下跌和由此而引起的国内市场的进一步混乱。通商产业省已经决定从8月15日起“冻结”棉布五千万平方码。在这以前，日本的棉布库存量到7月中旬已经达到六亿三千万平方码，超过正常库存量近一亿八千万平方码。
    岸信介政府曾经把扩大输出作为它“解救”危机的重要手段。然而，日本对外输出的前途也是不容乐观的。巴黎“国际论坛”驻东京记者不久前在一篇文章中写道，日本在1958年任何一个月中的出口都低于去年同月的出口，这是五年来的第一次。文章还说，通商产业相高碕达之助最近发愁地宣布，如果日本能够在今年度内输出二十八亿六千万美元（原订为三十一亿五千万美元），已经是很幸运的了，他甚至担心他所举出的这个数字过于乐观。显然，日本在受到当前世界经济危机的影响。实际上，东京对于美国所遭受的经济危机感到极大的不安。
    这位记者在评论岸信介政府采取的增加出口的措施时说，谁都无法说这一系列理论上的措施在出口方面将发生什么结果。悲观者肯定认为日本无法找出迅速解决的办法。
    由于国内外需求的急剧下降，日本的基础产业机器制造业也发生了前所未有的危机。据日本经济企划厅宣布，到5月为止，机器制造业的全部订货额共计二百三十三亿八千万日元，比4月份时减少了13.1％，比去年同一时期减少了68.6％。出口机器的订货额由于输出船舶的订货大量减少，下降得尤其惊人，5月份的订货比4月份减少了81.5％，比去年同一时期减少了94.2％。机器制造业的订货锐减，意味着生产设备的过剩还要继续发展。
    经济危机给日本工人带来了失业的苦难。目前，日本的失业现象非常严重：完全失业的工人已经达到八十五万人；从1月到5月，领取失业保险金的人数平均每月在四十万人左右，比去年同一时期增加了45％；受到解雇的所谓“整理人员”增加到去年同一时期的两倍；今年1月到4月间散工的雇用指数也比去年同一时期下降了15.1％。
    许多新毕业的学生在好容易才求得职业之后，又有为数不少的人不久就接到了“取消任用”或“缓期就职”的通知。最近，只是在纤维业中就发生这类事件达一万七千起。“日本经济新闻”认为，日本工人失业的情况今后将进一步恶化。
