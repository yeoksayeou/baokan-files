　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 12th: According to the Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" on the 12th, Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim said when he met with reporters from the Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily," "People's Voice," and Hungarian Radio in Baghdad on the 10th that if foreign countries do not interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, then all problems can be easily resolved. He said that the people of the Middle East have the ability to handle their own affairs.

　　In his conversation, Qasim said that in fact there is no such thing as a "Middle East problem," and that the complex and tense situation in the Middle East is created by foreign countries. The people of the Middle East love peace, are willing to live in friendship with other countries, and have never had the ambition to invade anyone.

　　When talking about the domestic and international significance of the Iraqi revolution, he said that the past system in Iraq was an anti-people system: workers, farmers, and the vast majority of residents were in an exploited position and had no freedom. The old regime colluded with foreigners to suppress the people. In the past, the vast majority of treaties and agreements were secretly signed by the then government, which violated the will of the people. Now, everything in Iraq belongs to the people, and the victory of the revolution has ended the past tyranny. Every citizen enjoys freedom and democratic rights, and now all treaties are signed with the consent of the people.

　　When talking about the future relationship between Hungary and the Republic of Iraq, Qasim said that now that the old system is gone forever, the relationship between Hungary and Iraq has become friendly. Now we are independent and free people, and we will establish friendly relations with the people of the world.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 12th: According to the "Guangming Daily" on the 11th, the Political Bureau of the Iraqi Communist Party issued a statement on August 1st, calling on the Iraqi people and government to be vigilant and prepared against the imperialist conspiracy against the Republic of Iraq.

　　The statement said that the establishment of the Republic of Iraq and its adoption of a policy of national independence have driven the imperialists and their agents mad, and they have been carrying out conspiracies against the Republic since the establishment of the Republic of Iraq by various means.

　　The statement said, "They are preparing to carry out heinous aggression from abroad, and are gathering insidious and cunning agents, instructing them to carry out sabotage, deception, and divisive activities in the country, in order to divide the national forces, create divisions within the fighting Iraqi people, and make its national government feel embarrassed."

　　The statement then exposed the conspiracies and rumors spread by the spies. The statement also exposed the conspiracy of some foreign companies to dismiss hundreds of workers and employees in order to make them unemployed and incite them to carry out erroneous strikes.

　　The statement said, "The Communist Party believes that these sudden and extremely important problems faced by the working class, farmers, and many people are nothing more than the result of some measures taken by the enemies of our people—the imperialists, their agents, and spies—and are only part of their despicable conspiracy against our country, people, and republic. Therefore, our party asks the people to remain vigilant and not to strike at a time when our country is in a very critical moment."

　　The statement also called on the government to take necessary measures to deal with those who created the above problems, and to control those banks and companies that are waiting for an opportunity to expand riots and economic chaos in the country through their activities.

　　The statement especially called on the workers in oil fields, pumping stations, port facilities, railways, and airports to be vigilant against the cunning conspiracies of imperialism and to be prepared to make sacrifices to defend the Republic.

　　The statement concluded by saying that through the unity of all forces in the national united front, through the unity of the people, and through supporting the noble national efforts made by the authorities, our beloved republic will be as solid as a rock, and without a doubt, all imperialist conspiracies and tricks will be shattered.

　　卡塞姆总理斥责外国干涉
　　伊共号召警惕帝国主义分裂阴谋
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　据匈牙利“人民自由报”12日报道：伊拉克总理卡塞姆10日在巴格达接见匈牙利“人民自由报”、“人民之声报”和匈牙利广播电台的记者时说，如果外国不干涉中东各国的内政，那么一切问题都好解决。他说，中东人民有能力来处理自己的事务。
    卡塞姆在谈话中说，事实上并不存在什么“中东问题”，中东复杂紧张的局势是由外国制造出来的。中东人民热爱和平，愿与其他国家友好相处，从来没有侵犯任何人的野心。
    在谈到伊拉克革命的国内和国际意义时，他说，伊拉克过去的制度是反人民的制度：工人、农民和绝大多数居民处于被剥削的地位，没有自由。旧政权与外国人一起来压制人民。过去绝大多数的条约、协定完全是由当时的政府秘密签订的，是违反人民的意志的。现在，伊拉克的一切都属于人民，革命胜利结束了过去的暴政。每个公民都享有自由和民主的权利，现在所有的条约都是通过人民的同意而签订的。
    谈到匈牙利和伊拉克共和国未来的关系时，卡塞姆说，现在旧制度已经一去不复返了，匈伊两国的关系就变成友好的了。现在我们是独立和自由的人民，我们将与世界人民建立友好的关系。
    新华社大马士革12日电　据
  “光明报”11日报道，伊拉克共产党政治局在8月1日发表了一项声明，号召伊拉克人民和政府对帝国主义反对伊拉克共和国的阴谋保持警惕和戒备。
    声明说，伊拉克共和国的建立和它采取民族独立政策的作法使帝国主义者及其代理人疯狂起来，他们从伊拉克共和国—建立就开始以各种手段进行反对共和国的阴谋。
    声明说，“他们正在准备从国外进行罪恶的侵略，并且纠集阴险狡诈的特务，指使他们在国内进行破坏、哄骗和分裂活动，以便分化民族力量，在战斗的伊拉克人民内部制造分裂，使它的全民政府感到为难。”
    声明接着揭露了间谍进行的阴谋和散布的谣言。声明并且揭露一些外国公司解雇数以百计的工人和雇员，借以使他们失业和怂恿他们进行错误的罢工的阴谋。
    声明说，“共产党认为，工人阶级、农民和许多人面临的这些突然的、极其重要的问题，只不过是我们人民的敌人——帝国主义者、他们的代理人和间谍——所采取的一些措施的结果，并且只是他们对我们的国家、人民和共和国的卑鄙阴谋的一部分。因此我们的党要求人民保持警惕，并且不要在我们国家处在非常紧要的关头的时候进行罢工。”
    声明还要求政府采取必要措施，来对付制造上述问题的那些人，并且对那些待机通过它们的活动在国内扩大骚乱和扩大经济混乱的银行和公司进行控制。
    声明特别号召油田、抽油站、港口设施、铁路和机场的工人对帝国主义的狡猾阴谋保持警惕，并且准备为保卫共和国而作出牺牲。
    声明最后说，通过民族统一阵线各种力量的团结一致，通过人民的团结和通过支持当局进行的崇高的民族努力，我们所珍爱的共和国将稳若磐石，毫无疑问，一切帝国主义阴谋和诡计都将被粉碎。”
