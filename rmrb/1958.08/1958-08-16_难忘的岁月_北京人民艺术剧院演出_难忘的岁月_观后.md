　　Unforgettable years, those years are truly unforgettable. Scene after scene on the stage recreates the heroic images of that time, page after page under the stage reopens the chapters of revolutionary history poems. More than twenty years have passed, time has only buried the defeated enemies, but cannot erase the brilliance of revolutionary struggle. Unforgettable! The Huangpu River stirred up huge waves of resistance against Japan. Stations, streets, schools, factories; water hoses, clubs, prisons, execution grounds; one person falls, thousands upon thousands stand up, to repel the cursed power in that cursed place! Unforgettable! Dark clouds weigh heavily overhead day and night, jackals and wolves are watching day and night, the shadows in the iron windows of Jiangdongmen, the blood in the soil of Yuhuatai. In that cursed place, the most unforgettable is the only relative to rely on - the Party! Party, unforgettable for life and death! Without you, who gives strength? Leaving you, who can overcome that dark茫茫? "With the Party's trust, what else do you need?" In the face of death, the proletarian warriors are so generous and strong! Today, bathed in the happy sunshine of the Mao Zedong era, who paved the way to freedom with blood, who can forget Yi Ning and Lao Zhang on that day? Excellent children of the Party, you don't want people to forget the past years, you want us to always remember that glorious example and dedicate everything we have to the Party!
    〔After watching the play, I can't sleep. I have no research on plays, can't say anything about my feelings, and can't write poetry, but I can't help but write the above few lines. It's just a reflection of a viewer's stirring mood after watching it. At the same time, I would also like to express my respect and gratitude to the playwright, director and all the performers.〕

　　难忘的岁月
　　——北京人民艺术剧院演出“难忘的岁月”观后王昆仑难忘的岁月，那岁月实在难忘。舞台上一幕一幕重现出当年的
  英雄形象，舞台下一页一页重翻起革命史
  诗的篇章。二十几年过去了，时间只埋葬了失败的敌人，却磨灭不了革命战斗的光芒。难忘！黄浦江上掀起了抗日的巨浪。车站，大街，学校，工厂；水龙，棍棒，监狱，刑场；一个人倒下去，千千万万人站起来，要在那可诅咒的地方，击退可诅咒的力量！难忘！黑云日夜重压在头上，豺狼日夜窥伺在身旁，江东门铁窗里的人影，雨花台泥土中的血光。在那可诅咒的地方，最难忘的是唯一可依靠的亲人
  ——党！党，生死难忘！没有你，谁给人力量？离开你，谁能战胜那黑夜茫
  茫？“有了党的信任，还需要什
  么？”在死的面前，无产阶级的战士是这么慷慨，
  坚强！今天，沐浴着毛泽东时代幸福的阳
  光，是谁用鲜血铺平自由的道路，谁能忘记当日的易宁和老张？党的优秀儿女们啊，你们不是要人对那过去的岁月
  难忘，你们是要我们永远记住那光辉
  的榜样，把自己的一切献给党！
    〔看了戏回来，睡不了觉。我对戏没有研究，说不出什么体会，也不会做诗，可是忍不住写下了以上的多少行。只不过是反映一个观众在观后激荡的心情罢了。同时，也借此表示一点对剧作者、导演和全体演出同志们的敬意和感谢。〕
