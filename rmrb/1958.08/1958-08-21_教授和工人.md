　　Professor and Workers
　　Liu Renchun
    A university professor came to our factory. The first time he went to the workshop, he insisted that our factory was too small to manufacture ball bearings. When the workers tried their best, he said it was "futile." Reality is ruthless after all; ball bearings were successfully trial-produced in our factory. But the professor said that this was "accidental" and "artificial," and that mechanization would be difficult.

    The professor wanted to order a precision measuring tool, saying that it could only be made at the Harbin Measuring Tool Factory. Our factory workers manufactured it and sent it to the professor to see. The professor said in surprise: "Huh? The Harbin Measuring Tool Factory made it for us so quickly!? It really is an advanced large factory." The workers laughed and said, "No, it clearly says it's a product of our factory! It wasn't sent to Harbin, it's too far!" The professor was even more surprised: "Hey! That's impossible, we don't have enough equipment!" The workers said, "If we don't have enough equipment, our manpower is still pretty good!"

　　教授和工人
　　刘人春
    我们工厂里来了一位大学教授。第一次出马下车间，他硬说，我们厂小，不可能制造弹子轴承。工人们努力设法，他说是“徒劳”。现实必竟是无情的，弹子轴承在我厂试制成功了。可是这位教授却说，这是“偶然的”、“人工的”，要机械化还有困难。
    教授要订作一种精密量具，说非到哈尔滨量具厂不能作，我厂工人制造了，送给教授去看看。教授惊讶地说：“呵？哈尔滨量具厂这样快就替我们制造出来啦！？到底是大厂先进。”工人哈哈大笑说：“不，上面明明写着是我们厂的产品！没有送到哈尔滨去，太远了！”教授更惊讶了：“嘿啊！这不可能，我们设备不足！”工人说：“设备不足，人力可还不错哩！”
