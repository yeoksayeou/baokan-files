　　On Qingyi's "Dedicate Everything to the Party"
　　Hé Fēng
    After watching the China Youth Art Theatre's performance of "Dedicate Everything to the Party," I was deeply moved and profoundly educated.
    The second team of Qingyi, under the personal guidance of Comrade Wu Yunduo, adapted Comrade Wu Yunduo's autobiographical reportage "Dedicate Everything to the Party," responding with practical actions to the Party's call to plant red flags, pull out white flags, and eliminate individualistic thoughts. This play not only enriched the repertoire of theatrical performances, but also played a great role in encouraging and educating everyone involved in socialist transformation.
    The adaptation of the script is successful, and the artistic generalization is quite concentrated, highlighting Wu Yunduo's growth in communist spirit. Communist Party members live among the masses, and Communist Party members must have a revolutionary spirit of dedication to complete the Party's revolutionary cause. The first scene, the old farmer's house, and the second scene, the riverbank, show the flesh-and-blood relationship between the New Fourth Army and the people. The fifth scene, the hospital, and the eighth scene, the position, show the war environment in which the New Fourth Army was at that time, with the enemy, puppets, Chiang, and the United States colluding internally and externally to encircle and destroy our Jiangbei anti-Japanese base area. The disparity in military strength between the enemy and us was extremely large, and the supply of ammunition was an urgent issue. Manufacturing ammunition to supply the needs of the front line is the highest task of the whole play. The script focuses on how the arsenal recovered production from scratch, how it overcame technical problems despite all difficulties, and how Wu Yunduo studied diligently and risked his life to experiment... What supported Wu Yunduo and encouraged Wu Yunduo? The script and performance answer this question very vividly and powerfully: it is the Party, it is the Party's revolutionary cause. The riverbank scene, Luo Kesheng's execution, the hospital scene, Wu Yunduo knowing that his injury would become a disability, the director giving him "How the Steel Was Tempered," and the chief of staff's constant care and enlightenment... From these detailed descriptions, one can clearly see the context of the character's ideological growth. The scene after the dark transition in the seventh scene also naturally reached the climax of the climax.
    The artistic treatment of the whole play is satisfactory. Take the set as an example, only one wall, but it completed the task of five interior scenes very well. The farmhouse, the hospital, the arsenal office converted from a broken temple, only the props are different, and the audience believes in the authenticity of the environment.
    The script and performance also have shortcomings, such as the loose plot in the first half of the old farmer's house scene, and Xiao Shunzi's multiple appearances and exits did not bring out the war atmosphere and environment, making people feel not real enough. The first half of the eighth scene also felt a bit dragging.

　　谈青艺的“把一切献给党”

    看了中国青年艺术剧院演出的
  “把一切献给党”，我受到深深的感动，也受到深刻的教育。
    青艺二队在吴运铎同志亲自指导下，改编了吴运铎同志写的自传体报告文学“把一切献给党”，以实际行动响应了党提出的插红旗拔白旗，肃清个人主义思想的号召。这出戏不仅丰富了剧场演出的剧目，对于投入社会主义改造的每一个人，更是起了很大的鼓舞教育作用。
    剧本的改编是成功的，艺术概括相当集中，较突出地写出了吴运铎的共产主义精神的成长。共产党员生活在群众之间，共产党员要以革命的献身精神才能完成党的革命事业。第一场老农家，第二场江岸，写出了新四军和人民的血肉关系。第五场医院，第八场阵地上，写出了当时新四军所处的战争环境，敌伪蒋美里应外合地包围破坏我江北抗日根据地，敌我军事力量悬殊极大，弹药供应是迫不及待的问题。制造弹药供应前线军需是全剧的最高任务，剧本集中地写了兵工厂怎样从无到有地恢复生产，怎样排除万难地克服技术上的问题，吴运铎是怎样刻苦地钻研，冒着生命危险作试验……是什么支持着吴运铎，鼓舞着吴运铎？剧本和演出非常生动有力地回答了这个问题：是党，是党的革命事业。江岸一场，罗克绳的就义，医院那场，吴运铎知道自己的伤将成残废，院长赠给他“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，以及参谋长经常的关怀和启发，……从这些细节的描写，可以清楚地看出人物思想成长的脉络。第七场暗转以后的那场戏，也就十分自然地到达了高潮的顶点。
    整个戏的艺术处理是令人满意的。拿景来说，只一面墙，可是却很好的完成了五场内景的任务。农家、医院，破庙改的兵工厂办公室，仅仅道具不同，观众相信了环境的真实。
    剧本和演出也还有不足之处，如老农家前半场的戏松散，小顺子上下场多次，并未将战争气氛和环境烘托出来，使人感到不够真实。第八场前半场也感到有点拖。
