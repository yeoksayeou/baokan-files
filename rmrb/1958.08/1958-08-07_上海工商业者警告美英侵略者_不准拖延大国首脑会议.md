Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai, angrily condemned the armed aggression of the American and British imperialists in the Middle East. They expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Arab people against imperialist aggression.

Chen Shutong, Li Zhuchen, and Hu Ziang, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, who are in Shanghai, said that American imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, a paper tiger, as proven in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The armed aggression of American and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan, facing the heroic resistance of the Arab people and the unanimous condemnation of peace-loving people around the world, has fallen into a dilemma and an embarrassing situation. Their paper tiger nature has been exposed once again. However, the economic crisis of imperialism is deepening. In order to make a desperate struggle, seize Middle Eastern oil, and extract the highest profits, they may expand the war of aggression. We must be vigilant, be prepared, stop the U.S. and Britain from playing with fire in the Middle East, and resolutely oppose the U.S. and Britain delaying the convening of a big power summit.

Hu Juewen, Wu Zhongyi, and Luo Bozhao, who participated in the delegation to Korea to express condolences and witnessed the American aggressor troops being beaten bloody, believe that in an era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, if American and British imperialism does not withdraw its bloody hands from the Middle East and recklessly expands the war of aggression, it will only accelerate its own demise.

The Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, who have suffered from American aggression and oppression, have long seen through the aggressive tricks of the United States. Its economy has always been built on the basis of plundering and exploiting the blood and sweat of the people of the colonies. Chen Mingshan of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory said that Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory suffered from the dumping of American relief materials in 1946, its production was suspended, and it almost went bankrupt. At the same time, the United States also used fake medicines to endanger the health of our people. We still have fresh memories of the ferocious plundering behavior of the colonialists, so we have brotherly sympathy for the Arab people's resistance to American and British armed aggression.

    上海工商业者警告美英侵略者
    不准拖延大国首脑会议
    新华社上海6日电　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通等和上海市的工商业者，愤怒谴责美英帝国主义对中东的武装侵略。他们表示坚决支持阿拉伯人民反抗帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    正在上海的中华全国工商业联合会正副主任委员陈叔通、李烛尘、胡子昂说，美帝国主义外强中干，是一只纸老虎，这在抗美援朝战争中已经得到证明。美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩、约旦的武装侵略，在遭到阿拉伯人民的英勇回击和全世界爱好和平人民的一致声讨下，已经陷于进退维谷、狼狈不堪的地步。它们的纸老虎本质又一次暴露出来。但是帝国主义经济危机日深，为了作垂死挣扎，攫取中东石油，榨取最高利润，有可能扩大侵略战争。我们必须提高警惕，作好准备，制止美英在中东玩火，坚决反对美英拖延大国首脑会议的召开。
    曾参加赴朝慰问团到过朝鲜，目睹美国侵略军被打得头破血流的胡厥文、吴中一、罗伯昭认为，在东风压倒西风的时代，美英帝国主义如不从中东缩回血手，真要挺而走险，扩大侵略战争，只会加速它自己的灭亡。
    曾经饱受过美国侵略压迫痛苦的上海工商业者，早就看透了美国的侵略惯技。它的经济一向是建筑在掠夺和剥削殖民地人民的血汗的基础上的。信谊药厂陈铭珊说，信谊药厂1946年受美国救济物资倾销的影响，生产停顿，几乎倒闭，同时，美国还以伪药来危害我国人民的健康。殖民主义者凶恶的掠夺行为我们记忆犹新，因此我们对阿拉伯人民抵抗美英武装侵略抱着兄弟般的同情。
