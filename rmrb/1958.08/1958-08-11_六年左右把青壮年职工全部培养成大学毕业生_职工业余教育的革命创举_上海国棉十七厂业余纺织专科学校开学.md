Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Zuohua reports: The Shanghai State-Run No. 17 Cotton Mill Spare-Time Textile College opened on the 7th.

This textile college strives to train all young and middle-aged employees of the State-Run No. 17 Cotton Mill into university graduates in about six years. Currently, the school has a total of 100 classes with an enrollment of 5,000, accounting for 60% of the factory's total workforce. Employees suitable for entering the college have basically enrolled.

This new type of spare-time school has both secondary and higher specialized sections. The duration of study for both sections is provisionally set at three years. A worker can reach the level of a university specialized course graduate after about six years of spare-time study, starting from becoming literate.

The Shanghai State-Run No. 17 Cotton Mill has more than 8,400 employees, with female workers accounting for over 66%. During the Rectification Campaign, especially since the launch of the technological revolution, workers have had an urgent need to learn culture and technology. This June, the factory adopted a method of "intensive effort followed by consolidation," enabling more than 1,500 young and middle-aged illiterate and semi-literate individuals to become literate. The factory's Party committee then established a Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee, formulated a complete set of training plans based on the needs of the technological revolution, and transformed the original night university and spare-time primary and secondary schools, which focused on cultural learning, into a spare-time textile college closely linked to the factory's production technology. This revolutionary measure was warmly welcomed by the workers, and the number of applicants exceeded the original number of cultural learners by one and a half times.

The teaching characteristics of this school are the integration of politics, culture, and technology. Both the secondary and higher specialized sections are divided into cotton spinning and cotton weaving departments. In addition to teaching courses such as Chinese language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the junior high school level, the secondary specialized section also teaches technical courses accounting for 16% of the study hours. In addition to basic courses, professional technical courses account for 38.1% of the total study hours in the higher specialized section. Both the secondary and higher specialized sections have political courses, taught by the person in charge of the factory's Party committee.

Why can workers be trained from just becoming literate to university students in about six years of spare time? Can this ensure the quality of students? During the school's establishment and the revision of the academic system, the employees of the Shanghai State-Run No. 17 Cotton Mill engaged in fierce debates. Those who doubted and opposed this approach believed that education could not leap forward and must adhere to conventions, proceed step by step, and follow so-called "standardized" methods. The workers firmly opposed this view because the time was too long, and some workers would be approaching retirement age. The workers believed that they have rich experience in political struggle and production knowledge, and they already understand the practical content of the basic principles and concepts of general professions, and now they need to systematize and further improve them. The content of the textile professional courses is the actual production that workers encounter every day. For example, Huang Baomei, a model worker in this factory, currently only has the cultural level of the first or second year of junior high school, but her skilled technology is equivalent to the level of a secondary professional school student, or a university student in the textile department of a textile university. Therefore, Huang Baomei can enter higher specialized studies after a certain period of cultural tutoring. Secondly, based on the workers' actual knowledge level, reforms are carried out in textbooks and teaching methods, deleting some of the originally "pagoda-style" repetitive content, and adopting straightforward teaching methods that workers can fully accept. Workers have a high level of political consciousness, are full of energy, have a clear purpose in learning, and make rapid progress. Based on this characteristic, the school divides each academic year into three semesters, with sixteen weeks of classes per semester, totaling forty-eight weeks per year, which is nearly half more teaching time than general schools, thus greatly shortening the length of study.

The Shanghai State-Run No. 17 Cotton Mill implemented the mass line of the whole Party running the school and the whole factory running the school in its operation. The school's academic system and curriculum have been fully discussed. All technical course teachers are part-time technical personnel from the factory, and the textbooks are also written by them. Therefore, it only took two weeks from preparation to opening. (Attached picture)

### 六年左右把青壮年职工全部培养成大学毕业生　职工业余教育的革命创举　上海国棉十七厂业余纺织专科学校开学

　　六年左右把青壮年职工全部培养成大学毕业生
　　职工业余教育的革命创举
　　上海国棉十七厂业余纺织专科学校开学
    本报讯　记者陆左华报道：上海国棉十七厂业余纺织专科学校7日开学。
    这所纺织专科学校争取六年左右把国棉十七厂青壮年职工全部培养成为大学毕业生。现在，全校共设一百个班，入学人数有五千人，占这个工厂职工总人数的60％，适合进这所专科学校的职工已基本入学。
    这所新型的业余学校，设有中等专科和高等专科两部分。两部的学习年限都暂定三年。一个工人从摘掉文盲帽子开始，经过六年左右的业余学习，就能达到大学专修科毕业生的水平。
    上海国棉十七厂共有职工八千四百多人，女工占66％以上。在整风运动中，特别是展开技术革命以来，工人们迫切需要学习文化和技术。今年6月，工厂采用先突击后巩固的办法，使一千五百多个青壮年文盲和半文盲脱离了文盲状态。工厂的党委接着成立文化革命筹备委员会，根据技术革命的需要，订出整套培养规划，并把原有偏重文化学习的夜大学、业余中小学全部改为培养和工厂生产技术紧密联系的业余纺织专科学校。这个革命措施，受到工人热烈欢迎，报名入学人数超过了原有学习文化人数的一倍半。
    这所学校的教学特点是，政治、文化、技术相结合。中等专科和高等专科都分棉纺、棉织两科。中等专科除了讲授初中程度的语文、数学、物理、化学等课程外，还讲授占16％学时的技术课。高等专科除基础课程外，专业技术课程占全部学时的38.1％。中等专科和高等专科都设有政治课，由工厂党委会负责人担任教师。
    为什么用六年左右业余时间就能把工人从刚摘掉文盲帽子培养成为大学生？这样做是不是能保证学生的质量？在学校创办和修订学制过程中，上海国棉十七厂职工展开了激烈的辩论。怀疑和反对这样做法的人，认为教育不能跃进，必须墨守陈规，按部就班，按照所谓“正规化”方法来进行。工人们坚决反对这种意见，因为时间太长，有些工人就要到退休的年龄了。工人们认为他们具有丰富的政治斗争经验和生产知识，对于一般专业的基本原理和概念的实际内容早已懂得，现在就需要加以系统化，进一步加以提高。纺织专业课程内容都是工人每天每时接触的生产实际。比如这个工厂的劳动模范黄宝妹，现在的文化水平虽然还只有初中一、二年的程度，但是，她的熟练技术，已经相当于中等专业学校学生水平，或者纺织大学纺织系的大学生的水平。因此，黄宝妹只要经过一定时间的文化补习，就可以升入高等专科学习。其次，根据工人实际的知识水平，在教材、教学方法方面进行改革，删去一些原来
  “宝塔式”的重复的内容，采取直截了当的讲授方法，工人完全可以接受。工人具有高度政治觉悟，干劲充沛，学习目的性明确，进步快。这个学校根据这个特点，将每学年分为三个学期，每学期上课十六周，全年四十八周，比一般学校增加将近一半的教学时间，这样学习年限就可以大大缩短了。
    上海国棉十七厂在办学中贯彻了全党办学、全厂办学的群众路线。学校的学制、课程都经过充分讨论。技术课的教师全部由本厂技术人员兼任，教材也由他们编写，因此，从筹备到开学只有两个星期的时间。（附图片）
