Agricultural Wonders

　　Rice with one husk containing two grains of rice has been successfully cultivated in Ma'an Agricultural Cooperative, Lubu Township, Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province. The test-planted rice seedlings now have an average of 13 ears per plant, each ear has an average of 174 grains, and each grain generally contains two grains of rice, with some containing three. The rice grain size is similar to that of silk rice.

　　These seeds were brought back from Wuzhou, Guangxi Province, last year by Lin Ai, a member of the cooperative, and were test-planted this year by the Youth Production Team.

　  一谷双米的水稻
    一粒谷里面包有两、三粒米的水稻，在广东高要县禄步镇马腌农业社试种成功了。现在试种的禾苗平均每蔸有十三穗，每穗平均一百七十四粒谷，每粒谷里一般有米两粒，多的三粒，米粒大小像丝苗米。
    这种谷种是该社社员林爱去年从广西省梧州带回来，今年由青年生产队试种。
