The cold blast iron smelting method using anthracite coal, created by the Ying Zhao Iron Industry Cooperative of Shanxi, has recently borne fruit in the Jiangcun Steel Plant in Guangdong.

This indigenous blast furnace at the Jiangcun Steel Plant, which uses anthracite coal and a cold blast to smelt iron, has an effective volume of 1.5 cubic meters and produces two tons of pig iron per day. The construction of this indigenous blast furnace only took five days. It officially went into production at 4:00 PM on August 6th and began producing iron at 12:00 AM that night. Molten iron was tapped approximately every 40 minutes, with each tapping yielding about 50 kilograms of iron. In forty hours, a total of more than two tons of iron were produced. Currently, white pig iron, which can be used for steelmaking, is being produced. If the composition of the charge is improved, gray pig iron, which can be used for casting, can also be produced.

The successful construction of the Jiangcun Steel Plant's indigenous blast furnace is mainly due to learning from the advanced experience of anthracite coal iron smelting in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, and receiving brotherly support from the Ying Zhao Iron Industry Cooperative of Yangcheng County, which sent veteran technicians Fan Yuliang and Liu Jun to Guangzhou to help build the furnace and smelt iron.

　　应朝炼铁经验在广东开花结果
    本报讯　山西应朝铁业社创造的用无烟煤冷风冶冻生铁的方法，最近在广东江村钢铁厂开花结果。
    江村钢铁厂这座用无烟煤冷风炼铁的土高炉，有效容积为一点五立方公尺，日产生铁二吨。这座土高炉只花了五天时间便已建成。8月6日下午四时正式投入生产，晚上十二时开始出铁，每隔四十分钟便出一次铁水，每次出铁五十公斤左右，四十小时共出铁两吨多，目前炼出来的是白生铁，可供炼钢；如果改进配料成分，还可炼出灰生铁，可供铸造之用。
    江村钢铁厂土高炉的建造成功，主要是学习山西省阳城县无烟煤炼铁的先进经验，并且得到阳城县应朝铁业社给予兄弟般的支援，派出该社老技工范裕良，刘骏前来广州帮助建炉炼铁。
