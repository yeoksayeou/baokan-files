Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 11th: The Japanese People's Peace March, which departed from Hiroshima and traveled east for 53 days, trekking a thousand kilometers, arrived at its destination, Tokyo, this afternoon.

The peace march, consisting of over ten thousand people, immediately proceeded to Hibiya Park in Tokyo upon arrival and participated in the "Central Rally to Stop the Nuclear Armament of Japan and Uphold Democracy."

The north and south bicycle peace relay race teams, which departed from Nagasaki and Aomori on July 21st and 28th respectively, also entered Tokyo at the same time today.

Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, announced at the rally that since the march departed from Hiroshima on June 20th, the number of people participating in the march and providing hospitality along the way has exceeded one million.

The activities of this peace contingent have propelled the anti-nuclear weapons movement in Japan to a new climax. The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has issued an appeal to the Japanese people: "Even for a day, even for a step, whether old or young, everyone should participate in the Great Peace March!" This appeal immediately turned into action by the Japanese people.

Like a torrent, the peace march grew more powerful as it moved east. Along the way, many cities that had not previously established local branches of the Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, such as Kasaoka City and Kurashiki City in Okayama Prefecture, and Ako City in Hyogo Prefecture, established local branches with the arrival of the peace march. The Iwata City Council in Shizuoka Prefecture, which had never participated in the peace movement before, also sent ten representatives to participate in the march this time.

During the march, the contingent felt immense anger at the continuous reports of new crimes by imperialism. On July 19th, Nishimoto Isao, who led the march, said at the Nagoya Peace Rally that while we were marching for peace, the United States tested nuclear weapons on Eniwetok Island, and the United States and Britain sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, trampling on the people's desire for peace. We must continue to move forward with renewed anger. (Attached picture)

### 把反对核武器的运动推向新的高潮　日本人民和平大军到达东京

　　把反对核武器的运动推向新的高潮
　　日本人民和平大军到达东京
    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：从广岛出发东行五十三日、跋山涉水一千公里的日本人民和平大游行队伍今天下午到达了目的地东京。
    一万多人的和平游行队伍到东京后立即开进东京日比谷公园，参加了“阻止核武装日本和拥护民主中央大会”。
    7月21日和28日分别从长崎和青森出发的南北两路自行车和平接力长跑队今天也同时进入东京。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在大会上宣布，自从6月20日游行队伍从广岛出发以来，沿途参加游行和招待工作的人数已经超过一百万人。
    这支和平队伍的活动使日本的反对核武器运动走向了新的高潮。日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会曾经向日本人民发出了呼吁：“一天也好，一步也好，老人也好，孩子也好，都来参加和平大游行！”这个呼吁立即变成了日本人民的行动。
    和平游行队伍像一支洪流似地越向东走声势越浩大。沿途，许多过去没有成立禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会地方分会的城市，如冈山县笠冈市、仓敷市和兵库县的赤穗市等地都随着和平游行队伍的到来而成立起地方分会。静冈县的磐田市议会过去从不参加和平运动，这次也派出十名代表参加了游行。
    游行队伍在进军途中，对接连传来的帝国主义的新的罪行，感到莫大的愤恨。7月19日，率领游行队伍的西本笃在名古屋和平大会上说，当我们为和平而游行的期间，美国在恩尼威托克岛试验了核武器，美英出兵侵略了黎巴嫩和约旦，蹂躏了人民的和平意愿，我们要怀着新的愤怒继续前进。（附图片）
