　　Lushun-Dalian Kelp Achieves High Yield
　　17,600 Kilograms Per Mu
    (Our dispatch) The staff of the Lushun-Dalian Aquatic Products Farm have improved their cultivation techniques this year, setting a world record of 17,600 kilograms per mu in artificial raft cultivation. Each kelp plant reaches six to seven meters in length and fifty centimeters in width. The heaviest kelp weighs seven jin. This year, the kelp production in the Lushun-Dalian area has reached the total output of the past thirty years, creating a huge wealth for the country.
    It is worth remembering that when the Japanese left Lushun-Dalian ten years ago, they said: "Once we leave, China's kelp cultivation will be finished." This arrogant nonsense has long been bankrupt. This year, China's kelp cultivation technology has surpassed Japan and ranks first in the world. The working people of our country have stubbornly studied, explored, and refuted the erroneous idea of "fate is predetermined." They created the "inverted rope cultivation" method, which allows kelp to receive light universally and grow evenly in three-dimensional water areas, improving kelp yield and quality. They invented the sharpening method, eliminating the kelp's white rot and thread rot diseases, which Japanese experts considered irresistible; and they successfully tested artificial fertilization, which not only increased yield but also expanded the cultivation area, enabling kelp to grow fat and large even in lean areas.
    This year, the workers and technicians of the Lushun-Dalian Aquatic Products Farm have also created the "downstream rafting, cross-stream leveling" cultivation method, which can reduce costs by half and increase output by more than twofold. Last winter, they also successfully tested underwater cultivation, solving a technical problem that has not been solved in the history of world kelp cultivation. (Zhao Hong'en)

### 旅大海带高产　亩产一万七千六百公斤

　　旅大海带高产
　　亩产一万七千六百公斤
    本报讯　旅大水产养殖场的职工，今年提高了养殖技术，在人工浮筏养殖上创造了亩产一万七千六百公斤的世界纪录。每棵海带的长度达六至七公尺，宽五十公分。最重的一棵海带有七斤重。今年旅大地区养殖海带的产量，竟达到了三十年来的总产量，为国家创造了一笔巨大财富。
    还记得十年前，日本人离开旅大时说：“我们走了，中国的海带养殖就完蛋了”。这个狂言乱语早已破产，今年我国海带养殖技术，已超过日本而跃居世界首位。我国的劳动人民顽强的学习，摸索，驳倒了“听天由命论”的错误思想，他们创造了“倒绳养殖”法，使海带在立体的水域里，普遍受光，均衡生长，提高了海带的产量和质量；发明了削尖法，消除了日本专家认为不可抗拒的海带的白烂病和线烂病；并试验成功了人工施肥，不但提高了产量，而且扩大了养殖面积，使海带在瘦区里也能长得又肥又大。
    今年旅大水产养殖场的工人和技术人员，又创造了“顺流下筏，横流垂平”养殖法，可使成本降低一半，并提高了产量二倍以上。去年冬天，还试验成功水下养殖法，解决了世界海带养殖史上所解决不了的技术问题。　（赵鸿恩）
