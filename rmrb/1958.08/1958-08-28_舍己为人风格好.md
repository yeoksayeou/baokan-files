　　The supply of saw blades on the market has been insufficient recently. The saw blades used in our factory have been ground very small and are on the verge of being unusable. We are very worried. How can we produce without saw blades? A few days ago, when Director Lu of our factory visited the Shanghai First Construction Engineering Company's Timber Processing Factory, he took the opportunity to request their assistance in solving the saw blade problem. Although the leading comrades of this factory also knew that saw blades were in short supply, as soon as they heard that our factory needed them urgently, they immediately took out a 42-inch large saw blade and a saw blade from the warehouse to support us. A few days later, our factory suddenly received a notice from the station that the Shanghai First Construction Company Timber Processing Factory had sent us three large circular saw blades. All the staff and workers in our factory were moved by their communist spirit of cooperation upon hearing this news. Everyone expressed that they would complete and overfulfill the state plan with greater enthusiasm.

　　舍己为人风格好
    近来，市场上锯片供应不足。我厂所使用的锯片已磨得很小，眼看不能使用了。我们非常着急，没有锯片怎能生产呢？前些天，我厂吕厂长到上海第一建筑工程公司木材加工厂参观时，顺便请求他们协助解决锯片问题。虽然这个工厂的领导同志也知道锯片缺货，可是一听我厂需要很急，立刻就从仓库里拿出一块四十二吋大锯片和一条锯条来支援我们。过了几天，我厂又突然接到车站通知，上海建筑一公司木材加工厂又给我厂发来大圆锯片三块。我们全厂职工听到这个消息以后，都为他们这种共产主义协作精神所感动。大家都表示一定要以更大的干劲来完成和超额完成国家计划。
