Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 29th: Baoding, Shijiazhuang and other regions in Hebei Province, proceeding from the overall situation, have rapidly increased the supply of pig iron and scrap steel to large steel plants in Tianjin and other places for steelmaking. On the 23rd, the first batch of 200 tons of newly produced pig iron was shipped from the Baoding area, and another 1,000 tons of scrap steel are being shipped successively. The first batch of 600 tons of pig iron and scrap steel from the Shijiazhuang area also began to be transferred from the 27th.

According to the spirit of the whole party and the whole people engaging in steel production, many first secretaries of the local party committees and county party committees, as well as secretaries in charge of industry, personally took charge and led hundreds of thousands of people to the mountains to fight hard, open up iron mines, and build iron smelting furnaces. Up to now, more than 27,000 small blast furnaces and native iron smelting furnaces have been built, and 4,692 have been put into production successively, producing molten iron. At the same time, commercial departments launched a campaign to purchase scrap steel and collected a batch of scrap steel. Due to the great development of local industry and agricultural production in various regions, there is also a great need for steel locally. The pig iron just starting to be produced and the scrap steel collected are far from enough. Several larger factories in Baoding Special District alone need more than 600 tons of steel for the production of eight products, such as gas generators, internal combustion engines, water pumps, and small locomotives, from August to mid-September. Under such circumstances, some comrades more or less developed departmentalism and decentralism. For example, a county in this special district was asked by the local party committee to transfer 70 tons of pig iron to a large steel plant in Tianjin for steelmaking, but they only "agreed" to give 30 tons. The local party committee immediately made a serious criticism of this erroneous thinking, pointing out that it is necessary to resolutely obey the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee on the unified allocation of materials, and resolutely complete the task of transfer. The local party committee also re-arranged the production in various regions at the ongoing meeting of county party committee industrial ministers and factory directors, preparing to postpone the products that could be postponed, transfer the steel, and first meet the needs of the national plan. In order to resolutely complete the task of transfer, the local party committees led the relevant departments to re-arrange the production in their respective regions, so as to transfer the steel and first meet the needs of the national plan, and put forward a guarantee: whatever the country wants, give it; how much it wants, give it. Kang Xiumin, the first secretary of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally took charge of the steel transfer work and instructed the special district economic planning commission to transfer all the steel that should be transferred within three days. In order to ensure the completion of the special district's transfer task, various machinery manufacturing factories in Shijiazhuang City voluntarily proposed not to use the iron supplied by the higher authorities for three days, but to dig up inventory and use waste materials to solve difficulties.

　　保定等专区  服从整体利益  钢铁大批上调
    据新华社天津29日电  河北省保定、石家庄等地区从全局出发，迅速上调生铁和废钢铁给天津等地大钢厂炼钢。23日，保定地区首批运出了刚生产的生铁二百吨，另有一千吨废钢铁正陆续启运。石家庄地区首批上调的六百吨生铁和废钢铁也已从27日起开始调运。
    河北省各地区根据全党全民大搞钢铁的精神，许多地委、县委的第一书记和管工业的书记亲自挂帅，带领数十万群众上山，苦战鏖战，大开铁矿，大建炼铁炉，到目前为止，已经建设起小高炉和土炼铁炉二万七千多座，并已有四千六百九十二座先后投入生产，流出铁水。同时，商业部门开展收购废钢铁的运动，收集了一批废钢铁。各地区由于地方工业和农业生产的大发展，当地也需要大量钢铁，刚刚开始生产的生铁和所收购的废钢铁还远远不够需要。保定专区几个较大工厂，仅8月份到9月中旬生产煤气机、内燃机、水泵、小火车头等八种产品，就缺少钢铁六百多吨。在这种情况下，有些同志或多或少产生了本位主义和分散主义思想，如这个专区有一个县，地委要求他们调出七十吨生铁给天津大钢厂炼钢，而他们只“答应”给三十吨，地委对这一错误思想立即作了严肃的批判，指出：必须坚决服从中央和省委统一调拨物资的指示，坚决完成上调任务。地委并在正在举行的县委工业部长和工厂厂长会议上，对各地区的生产重新进行安排，准备把能够推迟的产品推迟一步，调出钢铁，先行满足国家计划的需要。各地党委为了坚决完成上调任务，领导有关部门对本地区的生产重新作了安排，以便调出钢铁，首先满足国家计划的需要，并且提出保证：国家要什么给什么，要多少给多少。中共石家庄地委第一书记康修民亲自挂帅，指挥钢铁上调工作，指示专区经济计划委员会要在三天内把应上调的调出。石家庄市各个机械制造工厂为保证专区上调任务的完成，自动提出三天不要上级供应用铁，自己挖掘库存，利用废料来解决困难。
