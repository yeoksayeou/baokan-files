    Fangfusu
    A Mixed Fertilizer to Prevent Lodging
    The "May First" Cooperative Youth Fertilizer Plant in Jiesheng Township, Haifeng County, Guangdong Province, has successfully created a mixed fertilizer called "Fangfusu" that can prevent rice lodging.

    Fangfusu was created by six young people in the Youth Technical Research Group of the "May First" Cooperative Youth Fertilizer Plant. It is made by mixing 20% potassium sulfate, 20% bone meal, 8% superphosphate, and 52% soil manure. Rice that is about to lodge will show results within three days of using this Fangfusu. In the "May First" Cooperative, 210 mu of rice appeared to be on the verge of lodging, but after using Fangfusu, the rice stalks gradually hardened and stood upright.

    防伏素
    防止倒伏的混合肥料
    广东省海丰县捷胜乡“五一”社青年制肥厂创造成功一种能够防止水稻倒伏的混合肥料——防伏素。
    防伏素是“五一”社青年制肥厂的青年技术研究组的六个青年创造出来的。它是用20％的硫酸钾、20％的牛骨灰、8％的过磷酸钙、52％的土粪混合而成。凡是将要倒伏的稻子，只要使用了这种防伏素，三天内就能见功效。在“五一”社里有二百一十亩水稻看来就要倒伏，但是使用了防伏素以后，稻粳便逐渐转硬，直立起来了。
