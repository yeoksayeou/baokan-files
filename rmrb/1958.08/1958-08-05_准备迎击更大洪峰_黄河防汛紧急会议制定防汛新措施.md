Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th. The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters held an emergency flood control conference of the Yellow River here from the 1st to the 3rd, and decided on measures to defend against larger floods. The measures include expanding Dongping Lake to increase its water storage capacity by more than double; the water diversion and irrigation gates and water storage facilities under construction in the upper reaches of the Yellow River must be accelerated to complete water discharge as soon as possible, in order to weaken the flood peak as much as possible. Flood control measures must be considered from the worst-case scenario, and dikes that do not meet the standard height must be repaired; starting from the entire river, we must defend closely and resolutely to ensure that no flood disaster occurs in the entire river under any flood; we must cooperate with the railway department to protect the two major railway bridges of Zhengzhou and Luankou; and improve traffic, communication, and flood forecasting work in flood control.
    The meeting read out the congratulatory message from the Central Flood Control Headquarters to the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters for winning the battle against the extraordinary flood peak of 21,000 cubic meters per second of the Yellow River. The congratulatory message pointed out: The victory of this flood control struggle fully proves that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people, with their full exertion, can completely overcome natural disasters; at the same time, it also proves that the socialist system is incomparably superior. The congratulatory message used the vivid contrast between the complete victory of more than two million farmers, workers, cadres, and People's Liberation Army along the Yellow River fighting day and night to overcome the extraordinary flood of 21,000 cubic meters per second, and the heavy flood disaster caused by the similar flood in 1933 during the reactionary rule before liberation, emphasized: Now that the flood season has not yet passed, the flood peak may still make a sudden attack. It requires the river to maintain a high degree of vigilance, strictly prevent another flood attack, and ensure the complete victory of this year's flood control.

    准备迎击更大洪峰
    黄河防汛紧急会议制定防汛新措施
    据新华社郑州4日电　黄河防汛总指挥部1日到3日在这里召开的黄河紧急防汛会议，决定了防御更大洪水的措施。措施中包括扩建东平湖，使东平湖的容水量增加一倍以上；黄河上游正在施工的引水灌溉闸门和蓄水设施，要加紧施工，争取早日完成放水，以便尽量削弱洪峰。防洪措施要从最坏处着想，堤坝高度不够标准的要加修；从全河出发，严密地坚决地防守，要保证全河在任何洪水下都不发生洪水灾害；和铁路部门协作，保护好郑州和滦口两大铁桥；改进防汛中的交通电讯和洪水预报工作。
    会上宣读了中央防汛总指挥部给黄河防汛总指挥部祝贺战胜黄河两万一千秒公方流量特大洪峰的电文。贺电指出：这次防汛斗争的胜利，完全证明了在共产党的领导下，全体人民鼓足干劲，自然灾害是完全可以战胜的；同时也证明了社会主义制度是无比优越的。贺电用沿黄河二百多万农民、工人、干部和解放军日夜紧张战斗，获得战胜两万一千秒公方流量特大洪水的完全胜利，和解放前反动统治时期1933年发生类似洪水时造成的惨重水灾做了鲜明的对比后，强调指出：现在汛期尚未过去，洪峰仍有突然袭击的可能，要求沿河保持高度的警惕，严防洪水的再度袭击，确保今年防汛的彻底胜利。
