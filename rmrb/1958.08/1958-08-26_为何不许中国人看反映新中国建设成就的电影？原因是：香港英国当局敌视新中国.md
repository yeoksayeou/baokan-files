Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 23rd: Hong Kong news: The British authorities' film censorship organization in Hong Kong has consistently engaged in anti-China political conspiracy activities in film censorship over the past few years.

Since 1953, the British authorities in Hong Kong have banned seventy-two Chinese films from being shown in Hong Kong, including thirty-eight feature films, long documentaries, and thirty-four short films; in addition, twenty-seven films that were allowed to be shown were unreasonably censored.

Although Hong Kong residents are eager to know about the achievements of New China's construction and the situation of happy life, many films reflecting the situation of New China, such as "Be Sure to Harness the Huai River Well," "Magnificent Rivers and Mountains," "Jingjiang Flood Diversion," "Anshan Iron and Steel Works Under Construction," and "The Will of 600 Million People," have been banned from being shown. Films that record the Chinese people celebrating their great festivals every year, such as "1953 National Day" and "1953 May Day," have always been banned from being screened in Hong Kong.

The film censorship organization of the British authorities in Hong Kong has shown blatant hostility towards films with the Chinese national flag and people's leaders, either banning them from being shown or cutting out these shots. "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" was banned because there were several shots in the film of Chairman Mao's portrait hanging and the national anthem being sung. The documentary "Yangtze River Bridge" had an entire segment cut out simply because a voice-over stated that the locomotive speeding across the bridge had a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on it.

In addition, words in the films praising socialism and the People's Government were either banned from being shown or forcibly censored. In the film "Happiness," a whole segment was cut out because the protagonist said, "Now that we are liberated, everyone can live freely."

However, films made by the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan and films made by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong that openly touted the Chiang Kai-shek group were tolerated by the British authorities in Hong Kong and were often shown in Hong Kong. The film "Treasure Island Taiwan" made in Taiwan, repeatedly featured the flags of the Chiang Kai-shek group and shots of Chiang Kai-shek. Not long ago, Hong Kong screened a film called "Asian Games," and at least three-fifths of the film was dedicated to touting the Chiang Kai-shek group.

The above facts show that the film censorship organization of the British authorities in Hong Kong has been engaged in anti-New China and "two Chinas" political conspiracy activities in film censorship for several years. These conspiracy activities have aroused the indignation of the Chinese people; the Chinese people are closely watching the development of this political conspiracy activity.

　　为何不许中国人看反映新中国建设成就的电影？
　　原因是：香港英国当局敌视新中国
    据新华社广州23日电　香港消息：香港英国当局的电影审查机构几年来在电影审查中，一贯进行敌视中国的政治阴谋活动。
    自从1953年以来，香港英国当局已经禁止了七十二部中国影片在香港放映，其中包括三十八部故事片、长纪录片和三十四部短片；另外，在准许放映的影片中，还有二十七部被作了无理的删剪。
    虽然香港居民迫切希望知道新中国建设成就和幸福生活的情况，但许多反映新中国情况的影片，如“一定要把淮河修好”、“锦绣河山”、“荆江分洪”、“鞍钢在建设中”、“六亿人民的意志”等都被禁止放映。每年一度纪录中国人民欢度自己伟大节日的影片，如“1953年国庆节”、“1953年五一节”等，一直被禁止在香港上映。
    香港英国当局的电影审查机构对有中国国旗和人民领袖出现的影片，表现了露骨的敌视，不是禁止放映，就是要把这些镜头剪去。“女篮五号”被禁演，就是因为影片上有几个悬挂毛主席像和唱国歌的镜头。“长江大桥”纪录片，仅仅因为配音上有一句话说明在大桥上飞驰的火车头悬挂着毛主席像，就被整段剪去。
    此外，在影片中出现的赞扬社会主义、赞扬人民政府的话，不是被禁止放映，就是被强迫删剪。“幸福”一片，因为主角说了一句“现在解放了，谁都可以自由地生活”的话，就被剪去一整段。
    但是，蒋介石集团在台湾拍摄的和美蒋特务在香港拍摄的公开为蒋介石集团吹嘘的影片，却受到香港英国当局的纵容，而得以经常在香港放映。在台湾拍摄的“宝岛台湾”一片，就多次出现蒋介石集团的旗帜和蒋介石的镜头。不久以前，香港放映一部所谓“亚洲运动大会”的影片，这部影片至少有五分之三的篇幅是专门替蒋介石集团吹嘘的。
    上面的事实表明，香港英国当局的电影审查机构在电影审查中，几年来一直在进行着敌视新中国和制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋活动。这些阴谋活动，已经引起中国人民的愤慨；中国人民正密切注视着这种政治阴谋活动的发展情况。
