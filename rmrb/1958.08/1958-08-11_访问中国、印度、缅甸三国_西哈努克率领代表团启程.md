Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 10th – The Cambodian Royal National Delegation, headed by Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk, invited to visit China by Premier Zhou Enlai, left Phnom Penh this morning. Prince Sihanouk will first visit Rangoon and New Delhi, and then go to Beijing with the National Delegation.

　　More than 5,000 people went to the airport to see them off today. Those who participated in the send-off included Cambodian ministers and other senior military and government officials, the deputy head of the Chinese economic delegation, diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Cambodia, leaders from all walks of life in Cambodia, and representatives of overseas Chinese. Some people gathered on the road to the airport to cheer for Prince Sihanouk.

　　Prince Sihanouk issued a statement on the eve of his departure on the 9th, saying that my contact with Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru is solely for the happiness of the people of our countries and to consolidate the foundation of the tradition of friendship and unity between our countries in the cause of maintaining peace.

　　Prince Sihanouk also said, "Small countries should avoid two dangers: joining blocs and isolation. Joining blocs will harm our independence because we are too weak to remain independent from powerful partners. Isolation cannot maintain our independence because it will invite foreign threats. Therefore, our political responsibility is: neither to join blocs nor to depend on them, but to try to establish solid friendships."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 10th – Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk made a two-hour stop at Rangoon Airport today on his way to visit India.

　　Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Son Sann accompanied Prince Sihanouk. Welcoming Sihanouk and his entourage at the airport were Burmese Minister of Education U Maung Khaw, Minister of Immigration Shaw Tun Aye, Chinese Ambassador Li Yimang, and Indian Ambassador Mehrotra, among others.

　　The Cambodian authorities here said in an official statement that Prince Sihanouk will visit the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma. The statement pointed out that the purpose of the visit is "to strengthen the friendly ties between Cambodia and these great sister countries, making this relationship closer and more solid than ever before."

　　Prince Sihanouk will return here from India on August 13 to hold talks with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. After his visit here, he will go to the People's Republic of China for a visit.

　　访问中国、印度、缅甸三国
　　西哈努克率领代表团启程
    新华社金边10日电　应周恩来总理的邀请前来中国访问的以柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨王国国家代表团，今天上午离开了金边。西哈努克亲王将首先访问仰光和新德里，然后同国家代表团一起到北京。
    今天有五千多人到机场送行，参加欢送的有柬埔寨的大臣和其他高级军政官员、中国经济代表团副团长、各国驻柬埔寨的外交使节、柬埔寨各界领袖以及华侨代表等。有些人聚集在通往机场的公路上向西哈努克亲王欢呼。
    西哈努克亲王9日在动身的前夕发表声明说，我同周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理接触的唯一目的是为了我们这些国家的人民的幸福，在维护和平的事业中巩固我们这些国家之间的友谊和团结传统的基础。
    西哈努克亲王还说，“小国应当避免两种危险：参加集团和孤立。参加集团会损害我们的独立，因为我们太弱，所以不能对强大的伙伴保持独立。孤立不能维护我们的独立，因为这会招来外国的威胁。因此我们的政治职责是：既不参加集团，也不依附它，但是却要设法建立巩固的友谊。”
    新华社仰光10日电　柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王今天在赴印度访问途中，在仰光机场作了两小时逗留。
    陪同西哈努克亲王同来的有柬埔寨副首相兼外交大臣松山。在机场欢迎西哈努克及随行人员的有缅甸教育部长吴貌觉赞，移民部长肖吞埃，中国大使李一氓和印度大使梅罗特拉等。
    这里的柬埔寨当局在官方声明中说，西哈努克亲王将访问中华人民共和国、印度和缅甸。声明指出：访问的目的是“要加强柬埔寨和这些伟大的姊妹国家的友谊联系，使这种联系比以往更加密切，更加巩固。”
    西哈努克亲王将在8月13日从印度回到这里来，同缅甸总理吴努举行会谈。在他访问这里以后，他将前往中华人民共和国进行访问。
