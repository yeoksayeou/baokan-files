Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 25th: Many democratic groups in France have issued statements calling on the French people to reject de Gaulle's draft constitution in the national referendum to be held in September.

The French Anti-Fascist Committee pointed out in a communique that de Gaulle's draft constitution is a ladder to establish fascist dictatorship. It is a serious threat to the future of France. The committee calls on the people to express their loyalty to freedom and the republic by rejecting this draft constitution in the vote.

The Committee for the Defense of the Republic in the First District of Paris issued a letter to residents and workers, calling on them to give a negative answer to de Gaulle's draft constitution in the national referendum.

The Gard Province Aigues-Mortes County Committee passed a resolution calling on all Republicans to unite and vote against de Gaulle's draft constitution. Committees in Saint-Martin-de-Valgalgues, Connaux, Chamborigaud, Saint-Gilles, and the Saint-Charles district of Nimes have also expressed opposition to de Gaulle's draft constitution.

The Regional Federation of Miners of the French General Confederation of Labor called on its affiliated trade unions and various trade union departments to take action to organize a movement against de Gaulle's draft constitution.

In the Nord Province, a number of workers signed a letter to all miners of Douai-Ouest. They unanimously expressed that they would reject de Gaulle's draft constitution in the national referendum.

The district committees of the Socialist Party in Bordeaux have recently taken a stand against de Gaulle. A joint meeting of the various district committees of the Socialist Party in the city issued a statement condemning de Gaulle's amendment to the constitution as an attempt to establish a dictatorship.

A group of prominent figures in Isère Province also issued an appeal calling on the people to express a negative attitude in the national referendum. The appeal stated that the constitution formulated by de Gaulle poses a threat to our freedom that has not been seen since 1940.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Paris News: Yesterday morning, the gasoline depot of the Mougins-Billian refinery outside Marseille, France, exploded, causing a raging fire. Refineries in Paris, Toulouse, Le Havre, and other places also caught fire or were sabotaged. Several policemen were also killed.

After the incident, the French government immediately ordered special measures to intensify the persecution of Algerians in France. It dispatched a large number of police and gendarmes, conducted extensive interrogations of North Africans, and arrested dozens of Algerians.

Prior to this, the French government also decided to dissolve the "General Union of Algerian Workers." This organization united Algerians residing in France who participated in various trade unions, and its purpose was mainly to safeguard the material interests and rights of Algerians in France.
