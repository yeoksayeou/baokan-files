    Small Ants Can Gnaw at Big Bones, Small Machine Tools Can Build Large Machines
    (Report from our newspaper in Shenyang on the 19th) (Reporter Wang Dianxue, Chen Ji) Workers at the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant have comprehensively and systematically created a method of manufacturing large machines using the "ants gnawing at bones" approach, finding a new key to accelerate the development of China's machinery industry. The factory's workers used a complete set of small, specialized, indigenous machine tools designed and manufactured by themselves to replace large machine tools, successfully producing China's first large-scale fertilizer equipment, a high-pressure nitrogen-hydrogen mixed gas compressor weighing 182 tons.
    The "ants gnawing at bones" method created by the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant is as follows: in the absence of large machine tools, organize several light and small machine tools or small specialized machine heads to simultaneously process various large parts, which can solve the manufacturing difficulties of large equipment. The large gas compressor manufactured by the factory using this method has more than 6,000 parts, with the largest parts weighing more than 10,000 kilograms. Some parts have very strict technical requirements. Under normal circumstances, the manufacture of such large equipment requires a series of complex heavy machine tool processing equipment. The Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant used to only manufacture small products. Now, to manufacture such a large gas compressor, there were only two paths to take: one was to rely on the state to order a series of heavy machine tools from abroad; the other was to rely on self-reliance and create indigenous machine tools to replace large machine tools. If the first path was taken, it would cost more money and require waiting for two years. However, the country urgently needs fertilizer equipment and cannot wait for two years to start. Therefore, the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant decided to take the latter path. Starting in October of last year, they began to design and manufacture small, specialized, indigenous machine tools, totaling seven types and nineteen units. In May of this year, they began using this set of specialized indigenous machine tools to process large gas compressors, and it only took three months to complete the entire large machine.
    Although the parts of large equipment are very large, as long as several small machine tools are combined, like ants gnawing at bones, surrounding and attacking a large part, the large part can be gnawed out. The principle of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant's use of a set of specialized indigenous machine tools to process large parts is: install the large part to be processed on a large plate made of cement or cast iron, and then place several specialized indigenous machine tools around the large part, placing them on the large part or extending them into the large part for processing. The large part does not move, and the indigenous machine tools can move freely. In this way, large parts can be processed without heavy machine tools. The First Ministry of Machine Building summarized this "ants gnawing at bones" method. After research and appraisal by many machine tool designers across the country, it affirmed that this processing method is a new direction for accelerating the development of the heavy machinery industry.
    First, the quality of parts manufactured by this processing method is very good, and the production efficiency is very high. Taking the result of processing large cylinders as an example, the dimensions and accuracy meet the technical requirements, and the surface finish has reached level 7, which is the same as the quality standard processed by regular large machine tools. This means that indigenous machine tools, like large machine tools, can guarantee product quality. At the same time, since several specialized indigenous machine tools simultaneously process a large part, the production efficiency is much higher than that of regular large machine tools.
    Second, the specialized indigenous machine tools used in this processing method have a simple structure, the technology is not complicated, they are easy to manufacture, and the cost is low. Medium and small machine tool factories and general machinery manufacturing factories across the country can completely manufacture these specialized indigenous machine tools themselves. The cost of a set of specialized indigenous machine tools manufactured by the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant is only over 20,000 yuan per unit. However, it costs 590,000 yuan to buy a regular four-meter vertical lathe.
    Third, according to the processing principle of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant, not only can specialized indigenous machine tools be used to manufacture large-scale fertilizer equipment, but also specialized indigenous machine tools can be used to manufacture large-scale power generation equipment, large-scale rolling steel, metallurgical equipment, and other heavy machinery. After repeated research, the First Ministry of Machine Building has reached a major conclusion from a technical point of view: according to the processing principle of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant, other types of complete sets of small, specialized indigenous machine tools can be quickly designed and manufactured to solve the manufacturing problems of large-scale power generation equipment and large-scale rolling steel equipment. Now, the First Ministry of Machine Building has gathered more than 30 machine tool designers from across the country to the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant to speed up the design of two sets of small, specialized indigenous machine tools for processing large-scale power generation equipment and large-scale rolling steel equipment, and plans to complete the design in August of this year, striving to manufacture a batch of large-scale power generation equipment and rolling steel equipment by the end of the year.

    小蚂蚁能啃大骨头  小机床能造大机器
    本报沈阳19日电  记者王殿学、陈迹报道：东北机器制造厂职工全面地系统地创造出用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法制造大机器，为加速发展我国机械工业找到了一把新钥匙。这个工厂的职工运用自己设计和制造的一整套小型的专用的土机床来代替大型机床，胜利制成了我国第一台重达一百八十二吨的大型化肥设备——高压氮氢混合气体压缩机。
    东北机器制造厂创造的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法是：在缺少大机床的条件下，组织几台轻便的小机床或者小型专用机头，同时对各种大部件进行加工，就可以解决大型设备的制造困难。这个厂利用这种办法制成的大型气体压缩机，它的零件共有六千多个，最大的零件有一万多公斤重。有些零件的技术要求很严格。按照通常的情况，制造这样的大型设备，必须要有一系列复杂的重型机床的加工设备。东北机器制造厂过去只制造一些小型产品，现在要制造这么大的气体压缩机，只有两条道路可走：一条道路是依靠国家，向国外订购一系列重型机床；另一条道路是自力更生，依靠群众创造土机床来代替大机床。如果走第一条道路，就要多花钱，要等待两年的时间。但是国家迫切需要化肥设备，不能等上两年以后才动手。因此东北机器制造厂决心走后一条路。从去年10月开始自己动手设计和制造小型的专用土机床共七种十九台。今年5月，开始利用这套专用土机床，加工大型气体压缩机，只花了三个月时间，就全部制成这个大型机器。
    大型设备的零件虽然很大，但是只要把几台小机床联合起来，像蚂蚁啃骨头似地围攻一个大零件，就可以把大零件啃出来。东北机器制造厂运用一套专用的土机床来加工大零件的原理是：把被加工的大零件安装在用水泥或者铸铁板做的大平板上，再把几台专用的土机床，围绕着这个大零件，放在大零件上或者伸入大零件内进行加工。大零件不动，土机床可以自由活动。这样不用重型机床，也把大零件加工好了。第一机械工业部总结了这种“蚂蚁啃骨头”方法，经过全国许多机床设计人员的研究和鉴定，肯定了这种加工方法是加速发展重型机械工业的一个新方向。
    第一，这种加工方法制成的零件的质量很好，生产效率又很高。以加工大汽缸的结果为例，尺寸、精度都合乎技术要求，表面光洁度已达到七级，和正规的大机床加工的质量标准相同。这就是说，土机床也和大机床一样，能够保证产品的质量。同时，由于几台专用土机床同时对一个大零件进行加工，因此生产效率比正规的大机床要高得多。
    第二，这种加工方法所采用的专用土机床，结构简单，技术不复杂，很容易制造，而且造价低廉。全国中、小型机床厂和一般机械制造厂，都完全可以自制这种专用土机床。东北机器制造厂制造的一套专用土机床，每台成本不过两万多元。但是，要买一台正规的四公尺立式车床，却要五十九万元。
    第三，根据东北机器制造厂的加工原理，不但可以用专用土机床来制造大型化肥设备，而且也可以用专用土机床来制造大型发电设备、大型轧钢、冶金设备以及其他重型机械等。第一机械工业部经过多次研究以后，已经从技术上得出一个重大的结论，按照东北机器制造厂的加工原理，可以很快设计和制造出别种类型的整套的小型的专用土机床，来解决大型发电设备和大型轧钢设备的制造问题。现在第一机械工业部已经集中了全国三十多名机床设计人员，到东北机器制造厂，加紧设计出两套用于加工大型发电设备和大型轧钢设备的小型专用土机床，并且计划在今年8月设计完毕，争取在年底制造出一批大型发电设备和轧钢设备。（附图片）
