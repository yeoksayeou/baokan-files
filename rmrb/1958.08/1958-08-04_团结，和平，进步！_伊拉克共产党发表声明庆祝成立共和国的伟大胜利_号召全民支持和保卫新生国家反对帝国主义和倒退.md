Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 3rd. "Al-Nour" newspaper in Damascus reported on the 3rd that the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party issued a statement on July 14, calling on the people to unite around the Republic of Iraq, support it, and defend it.

The statement said, "The activities of our heroic army ended the rule of the imperialist dynasty and announced the establishment of the Iraqi government. This is a welcome and historically significant glorious event supported by the people. There is no doubt that we, the Iraqi people, must defend the young republic against imperialism and regression. The Iraqi people have been fighting for this. In this struggle, the Communist Party fully participated and made sacrifices."

The statement said: "On the one hand, the revolution makes the forces of freedom and peace happy; on the other hand, it infuriates the imperialists and their agents, because this is a serious blow to their greedy interests in our country and the corrupt rule they have imposed on our people by force for a long time. As a result, conspiratorial meetings were held in the United States, Britain, Amman, and Istanbul, and the imperialists began to openly threaten and tried their best to restore royal rule in our beloved Iraq."

The statement said, "We are deeply convinced that the Iraqi people, Arabs, Kurds, workers, peasants, the strength of the army and the strength of the people in struggle will be able to unite and repel any heinous invaders."

The statement pointed out, "We are deeply convinced that the Arab people will support our beloved revolution that has destroyed the bastion of tyranny and conspiracy. We are deeply convinced that the forces of freedom and peace all over the world, led by the Soviet Union, are the strong friends of the Iraqi people in our struggle."

The statement said: "This tremendous trust in our strength should not make us blind. We should know that imperialism will not surrender easily without resistance. It will do its utmost to prepare for aggression against our country in order to restore imperialist rule."

The statement said, "In order to avoid any possible danger, we ask our republican government to maintain high vigilance, and we must take all necessary measures to defeat all conspiracies of imperialism to undermine our victory."

The statement called on the people to unite and block all roads in front of the enemy, and to liberate all heroic freedom fighters who have been exiled and imprisoned. The statement said: "Our revolution relies on our struggle and vigilance. Therefore, we should begin to organize committees to defend the republic in factories, shops, rural areas, and public organizations. We should organize people's resistance forces to prepare for any unforeseen events."

The statement concluded: "We Iraqi communists (whose leaders were once hanged by the imperialists) hereby appeal to the republic and fight together with the national forces. We assure our loyal people that we will fight together with the nationalists until we shed our last drop of blood to defend our Iraqi Republic, eliminate the last imperialist, and wipe out all imperialist agents in the country, in order to achieve freedom, democracy and a life of dignity, Arab unity, peace and progress."

    伊拉克共产党发表声明庆祝成立共和国的伟大胜利
    号召全民支持和保卫新生国家反对帝国主义和倒退
    新华社大马士革3日电　据大马士革“光明报”3日报道，伊拉克共产党中央委员会在7月14日发表声明，号召人民团结在伊拉克共和国的周围，支持并且保卫它。
    声明说，“我们的英勇的陆军的活动，结束了帝国主义的王朝的统治，并且宣布成立伊拉克政府，这是值得欢迎和人民支持的具有历史意义的光荣事件。毫无疑问，我们伊拉克人民一定要保卫年青的共和国，反对帝国主义和倒退。伊拉克人民一直在为此而斗争。在这场斗争中，共产党完全参加而且作出了牺牲。”
    声明说：“一方面，革命使自由和和平的力量感到高兴，另一方面，它使帝国主义者和他们的代理人恼羞成怒，因为这是对他们在我国的贪婪的利益和他们长时期用武力强加给我国人民的腐朽统治的严重打击。结果是在美国、英国、安曼和伊斯坦布尔进行了策划阴谋的会议，帝国主义者开始公开威胁而且极力要在我们热爱的伊拉克恢复王室统治。”
    声明说，“我们深信伊拉克人民、阿拉伯人、库尔德人、工人们、农民们、军队的力量和斗争中的人民的力量，他们一定能够团结一致，击退任何万恶的侵略者。”
    声明指出，“我们深信阿拉伯人民一定会支持摧毁了暴政和阴谋的堡垒的我们所热爱的革命，我们深信，以苏联为首的全世界自由和和平的力量，它们是我们斗争中的伊拉克人民的强大的朋友。”
    声明说：“对我们的力量的这种巨大的信任，不应该使我们因而盲目。我们应当知道，帝国主义不会轻易地毫无抵抗地投降。它将极力准备对我国的侵略，以恢复帝国主义统治。”
    声明说，“为了避免任何可能的危险，我们要求我们的共和国政府保持高度的警惕，我们必须采取为击溃帝国主义企图破坏我们的胜利的各种阴谋的一切必要措施。”
    声明号召人民团结一致，以堵塞敌人面前的一切道路，并且使被放逐的和被投入监狱的一切英勇的自由斗争者获得自由。声明说：“我们的革命依靠我们的斗争和警惕性，因此，我们应该开始在工厂、商店、农村和公共团体内组织保卫共和国委员会。我们应当组织人民抵抗部队，以准备对付任何预料不到的事件。”
    声明最后说：“我们伊拉克共产党人（他们的领袖曾经被帝国主义者绞死）谨向共和国发出呼吁，并且同全国力量一起进行斗争。我们向我们的忠实的人民保证，我们一定同民族主义者一起进行斗争，直到流尽我们最后一滴血，以保卫我们的伊拉克共和国，清除最后一个帝国主义者，并且肃清国内的一切帝国主义代理人，以实现自由、民主和尊严的生活，阿拉伯团结，和平和进步。”
