　　New Life in the New Era
　　Tián Gēng
    Our country is in an era of the Great Leap Forward. Various socialist construction undertakings are leaping forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." Everything hindering the Great Leap Forward will be eliminated and transformed; everything that meets the needs of the Great Leap Forward is emerging. The public canteens, nurseries, machine sewing groups, and other socialization and collectivization of housework in the vast countryside are born out of the needs of the Great Leap Forward, and this is the sprout of a new way of life in the new era.

    After the Great Leap Forward, there has been a shortage of labor in various places. Women, who account for half of the population, are a huge force. Liberating the vast number of women from housework and allowing them to participate in the Great Leap Forward, producing and working shoulder to shoulder with men, will largely solve the contradiction of labor shortage and will enable our various socialist construction undertakings to leap forward at a higher speed.

    However, the significance of the socialization of housework is by no means limited to solving the contradiction between the Great Leap Forward and the shortage of labor. It also profoundly affects all aspects of our lives. When the vast number of women leave the "three contains" and "four contains" and go to the fields and factories, they fundamentally change the relationship between the vast number of women and society. They have become direct participants in socialist construction, and they have every possibility to participate in various social and cultural activities like men. This will truly equalize the vast number of women with men in all aspects, will make the vast number of women develop and advance together with men in all aspects, and will completely and thoroughly liberate the vast number of women in all aspects.

    The significance of the socialization of housework is not limited to the liberation of women. The socialization of housework will inevitably promote the collectivization of farmers' lives. As a result, not only can social productive forces be developed more quickly, not only are many convenient conditions created for improving the cultural and scientific level of all workers, but also the collectivist spirit of the people is greatly cultivated. When people are integrated not only in production labor but also in all aspects such as eating, dressing, and raising children, they will always feel that they are members of the collective, and collectivist thought will grow in communal life.

    Any doubt and apprehension about the socialization of housework are unnecessary and wrong. Countless facts have proven that the socialization of housework is beneficial and harmless to everyone. Take the public canteens in the countryside as an example. Running public canteens will not only not lead to "waste of food" or "not enough food," but will also save more food than cooking at home; in public canteens, people can not only eat enough but also eat well. Some cadres have doubts about the socialization of housework—especially public canteens—because they underestimate the ideological awareness of the vast number of farmers. This kind of detachment from reality and detachment from the masses, which does not believe in the masses and cannot see the rapid improvement of farmers' awareness in the Great Leap Forward, should be overcome quickly. As for the doubts of a few people, they are mainly bound by so-called "habits." As long as we do a good job in political and ideological work, adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and run the public canteens, nurseries, etc., which are first participated in by activists, well, the doubts of a few people will be quickly dispelled. The Great Leap Forward requires cooperation in all aspects. The new era also requires a new life.

　　新时代的新生活
　　田耕
    我们的国家，正处在一个大跃进的时代里。各项社会主义建设事业，正以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前跃进。一切妨碍大跃进的东西都将被清除被改造；一切适合大跃进需要的东西正在应运而生。广大农村里的公共食堂、托儿所、机器缝纫组以及其他的家务劳动的社会化和集体化，就是由于大跃进的需要而诞生的，这是新时代的新的生活方式的萌芽。
    大跃进后，各地都出现了劳动力不足的现象。占人口半数的妇女是一支巨大的力量。使广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加大跃进的行列，同男人肩并肩地生产、劳动，将在很大程度上解决劳动力不足的矛盾，将使我们的各项社会主义建设事业以更高的速度向前跃进。
    但是家务劳动社会化的意义，绝不仅仅限于能够解决大跃进与劳动力不足的矛盾，它还深刻地影响着我们生活的各个方面。广大妇女离开“三含”、
  “四含”，走向田野和工厂，就从根本上改变了广大妇女同社会的关系。她们成了社会主义建设的直接参加者，她们有了一切可能像男人一样地参加各种社会活动和文化活动。这样就会使广大妇女在一切方面同男人真正平等，就会使广大妇女在一切方面同男人一同发展，齐步前进，就会使广大妇女在一切方面获得完全的彻底的解放。
    家务劳动社会化的意义也不只是限于妇女的解放。家务劳动社会化必然促进农民生活的集体化。结果，不仅可以更快地发展社会生产力，不仅为提高全体劳动者文化科学水平创造了很多方便条件，也极大地培育着人民的集体主义精神。当人们不仅在生产劳动中，也在吃饭穿衣、教养子女等一切方面都结合成一体的时候，就会时刻感到自己是集体中的一员，集体主义思想就会在共同生活中成长起来。
    对家务劳动社会化的任何怀疑和顾虑心理，都是不必要的错误的。无数的事实已经证明，家务劳动社会化无论对谁都是有利无害的。就拿农村的公共食堂为例吧，办了公共食堂不但不会发生“浪费粮食”，“粮食不够吃”等现象，还比自家作饭节省粮食；在公共食堂里不仅吃得饱，而且也吃得好。某些干部对家务劳动社会化——特别对公共食堂有疑虑，是过低估计了广大农民的思想觉悟。这种不相信群众，看不见大跃进中农民觉悟飞速提高的脱离实际、脱离群众的毛病应该赶快克服。至于少数群众的疑虑，主要是受着所谓“习惯”的束缚，只要作好政治思想工作，坚持自愿原则，把首先由积极分子参加的公共食堂、托儿所等办好少数群众的疑虑很快便会打消的。大跃进需要有各方面的配合。新时代也需要有新的生活。
