Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 2nd - Damascus’s "Al-Nour" newspaper published a commentary on August 1st stating, "The election of General Shehab (as president) will not solve the Lebanese problem. The main issues are the withdrawal of American occupation troops from Lebanese territory, the restoration of independence and sovereignty, and the wiping away of the shame that Chamoun brought to Lebanon."

The commentary, in analyzing the situation in Lebanon, stated that since the election of Chamoun’s successor, the propaganda tools of imperialism have launched a large-scale propaganda campaign to distort the Lebanese problem, aiming to make the Lebanese people believe that the cause they have been fighting for has ended with the election of a new president to succeed the traitor Chamoun. But imperialism will not succeed, because the Lebanese people are more sober and more vigilant than the American aggressors imagine.

"Al-Ray Al-Aam" published an editorial on August 1st regarding Shehab's election as President of Lebanon, stating: "Do not hope to make a premature judgment on General Shehab's election as President of the Republic, because Shehab's actions and behavior will make the judgment."

The newspaper also said, "The news we received from Lebanon gives people no reason to feel comforted or at ease. This news shows that, although President Shehab intends to abide by the constitution, he has not guaranteed that he intends to immediately end the American occupation of Lebanon and lead Lebanon on a path that conforms to the will of its insurgent people."

The editorial pointed out that the statement issued by the US Embassy in Lebanon on the evening of July 31st, after Shehab's election as president, is noteworthy. This statement indicates: "The American troops occupying Lebanon are still stationed there to achieve far-reaching aggressive goals, threatening the security of the United Arab Republic and the Middle East and the world; secondly, the American occupation troops are not satisfied with supervising the election of the new president, but will continue to occupy in order to impose on Lebanon a certain political status that conforms to the purposes of the imperialists and is completely contrary to the will of the majority of the insurgent Lebanese people."

"Al-Siassa" pointed out on August 1st that Shehab had promised to make the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon his first duty. "Al-Siassa" continued, "We believe that the situation will not become clear as quickly as some people think, because the guarantees that Shehab may have made remain to be put into practice."

"Al-Kifah" said on August 1st that Shehab did not publicly guarantee to fulfill the conditions of the opposition, because all discussions were conducted behind the scenes. It said, "This means that the struggle in Lebanon is not over unless foreign troops and Chamoun leave the country, so that the conspiracy to make Lebanon an international state will be declared a failure."

"Al-Nasr" pointed out in an editorial, "If Shehab wants the Lebanese people to forget that he was elected under the shadow of the American occupation, then his task should be to make the Americans withdraw."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 1st - According to the Middle East News Agency, citing officials of the United Arab Republic on July 31st regarding Shehab's election as President of Lebanon, the US government had contacted President Nasser on May 20, 1958, to discuss the Lebanese situation. Nasser had proposed at that time that General Shehab succeed to the presidency. The official said that the final solution found was still "the kind of solution proposed by President Nasser."

    大马士革报纸评黎巴嫩局势
    美国撤出占领军是当前急务
    谢哈布当选总统并不能解决问题
    新华社大马士革2日电　大马士革“光明报”1日发表评论说，
  “谢哈布将军的当选（总统）不会解决黎巴嫩问题。主要的问题是美国占领军撤出黎巴嫩领土，恢复独立和主权，洗雪夏蒙给予黎巴嫩的耻辱。”
    评论在分析黎巴嫩的局势时说，自从夏蒙的继承人当选以来，帝国主义的宣传工具发动了大规模的宣传运动来歪曲黎巴嫩问题，目的是想使黎巴嫩人民相信，他们一直在争取的事业随着接替卖国贼夏蒙的新总统的当选而结束了。但是帝国主义是不会成功的，因为黎巴嫩人民比美国侵略者所想像的更为清醒和更为警惕。
    “舆论报”1日就谢哈布当选黎巴嫩总统一事发表社论说：“不要希望对谢哈布将军当选共和国总统一事过早作出判断，因为谢哈布的行动和行为会作出判断的”。
    这家报纸又说，“我们从黎巴嫩得到的消息使人们没有理由感到安慰或安心。这些消息表明，虽然谢哈布总统打算遵守宪法，他并没有保证他打算立即结束美国对黎巴嫩的占领，领导黎巴嫩走上符合它的起义的人民的意志的道路”。
    社论指出，美国驻黎巴嫩大使馆7月31日晚上在谢哈布当选总统以后发表的声明是值得注意的。这项声明表明：“占领黎巴嫩的美军为了达到深远的侵略目的，仍然驻在那里，威胁阿拉伯联合共和国和中东以及世界的安全；其次，美国占领军并不满足于监督新总统的选举，而将继续占领，以便把符合帝国主义者的目的而完全违背大多数起义的黎巴嫩人民的意志的某种政治地位强加在黎巴嫩身上。”
    “呼声报”1日指出，谢哈布曾经答应把使美国军队撤出黎巴嫩作为他的第一项职责。“呼声报”接着说，“我们认为局势不会像有些人认为的那样迅速地明朗化，因为谢哈布可能已经提出的保证尚待付诸实践。”
    “火炬报”1日说，谢哈布并没有公开保证履行反对派的条件，因为一切讨论都是在幕后进行的。它说，“这意味着黎巴嫩的斗争还没有结束，除非外国军队和夏蒙离开这个国家，这样才会使黎巴嫩成为国际国家的阴谋宣告失败。”
    “胜利报”在社论中指出，“假如谢哈布要黎巴嫩人民忘记他是在美国占领的阴影下当选的，那么他的任务应该是使美国人撤走。”
    新华社开罗1日电　据中东通讯社援引阿拉伯联合共和国负责人士7月31日就谢哈布当选黎巴嫩总统一事发表的谈话说，美国政府曾经在1958年5月20日同纳赛尔总统接触，讨论黎巴嫩局势问题。纳赛尔当时曾提出由谢哈布将军继任总统职务。这位人士说，最后发现的解决办法还是“纳赛尔总统所提议的那种办法”。
