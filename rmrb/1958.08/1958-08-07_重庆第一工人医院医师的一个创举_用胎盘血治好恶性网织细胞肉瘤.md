Using Placental Blood Cures Malignant Reticular Cell Sarcoma

(Our reporter Li Sufen reports) Chongqing First Workers' Hospital achieved remarkable results in treating a patient with malignant reticular cell sarcoma using intramuscular injections of placental blood.

On July 19th, more than 30 experts from Chongqing's medical and health fields held a meeting to analyze and study the diagnosis and treatment of this case.

On February 12th, Chongqing First Workers' Hospital admitted a patient named Shi Yuan. The patient had a fever, swollen lymph nodes all over the body, the largest being the size of a peach. His face was swollen and deformed. White blood cells, red blood cells, and hemoglobin were significantly reduced. The spleen was enlarged to six centimeters. After physical examination, experiments, and three biopsies, it was diagnosed as reticular cell sarcoma. After the patient was admitted to the hospital, the hospital used common palliative treatments for more than 20 days, but the condition worsened. Irregular fever, reaching a maximum of 41 degrees Celsius; bone marrow cell development was suppressed; appetite decreased, and the patient became listless; the spleen enlarged to twelve centimeters, and anemia worsened. The white blood cell count dropped from more than 3,000 per cubic centimeter at the time of admission to more than 1,100, the red blood cell count dropped from 3.1 million to 2.81 million, and the hemoglobin decreased from 60% to 46%. As the condition deteriorated to this point, radiotherapy and nitrogen mustard therapy were no longer suitable. In order to enhance the patient's ability to resist disease in critical condition, Li Zhongcai, the attending physician of the hospital's internal medicine department, decided to continue blood transfusions to actively save the patient. However, considering that the patient needed a lot of blood, and fresh blood was too expensive, he came up with the idea of using placental blood instead of fresh blood. Starting from March 10th, he continuously injected (once a day, 10 ml each time). After ten days, the condition improved significantly: anemia was reduced, fever subsided, the spleen shrank, appetite increased, and weight increased. Only the lymph nodes remained swollen. Li Zhongcai continued to inject the patient with 10 ml of placental blood every day. After eighteen days, the body temperature normalized, and the lymph nodes also shrank one after another. Two months later, all systemic symptoms disappeared, leaving only a lymph node the size of a broad bean palpable under the left jaw (currently suffering from dental disease). Now, the patient is still continuing to inject placental blood.

After listening to the pathological diagnosis and case treatment report, watching the slides of the patient's biopsy examination, and visiting the patient, the experts in Chongqing at the meeting believed that this discovery was a creation in Chinese medicine. Is this therapeutic effect due to the placental blood, or is it a coincidence? The experts firmly believe that it is not a coincidence. The reasons are: (1) The improvement of various clinical symptoms after placental blood injection can determine its effect. At the same time, during the treatment process, the condition worsened immediately due to intermittent injections caused by insufficient supply of placental blood; it improved immediately after resuming injections. (2) According to the analysis of several experts from the Seventh Military Medical University and Chongqing Medical College who participated in the examination: From the biopsy examination at the time of admission, the entire lymph node was destroyed. More than a month after the placental blood injection, the second and third biopsy examinations, whether from the scope of the lesion, the cellular components, or the degree of deterioration, all went from bad to good, from serious to mild.

The experts said that this treatment method has four major advantages: (1) Radiotherapy and nitrogen mustard therapy are not suitable for severe anemia and white blood cell counts below 2,000 per cubic centimeter; while placental blood treatment is not subject to this restriction. (2) Placental blood is available everywhere, and the injection method is simple, easy for medical staff to master, and the injection equipment is simple and economical. (3) Intramuscular injection of placental blood is not painful, does not cause side effects, and is easily accepted by patients.

The experts believe that the key issue at present is: how to further explore the use of placental blood. The Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau has decided to immediately establish a scientific research team and set up special beds for treating this disease with placental blood.

    重庆第一工人医院医师的一个创举
    用胎盘血治好恶性网织细胞肉瘤
    本报讯　记者黎素芬报道：重庆市第一工人医院用肌肉注射胎盘血疗法，治疗一个患恶性网织细胞肉瘤的病人获得显著疗效。
    7月19日，重庆医药、卫生界三十多名专家开会对这个病案的诊断与治疗情况作了分析和研究。
    2月12日，重庆第一工人医院接收了一个名叫石元的病人。病人发烧，全身淋巴腺肿大，最大的有如桃子，面部肿成畸形，白血球、红血球和血色素都显著减少，脾脏肿大到六公分。经过体格检查、实验和先后三次切片诊断，证明是网织细胞肉瘤。病人入院后，医院曾经采用内科常用的姑息疗法治疗二十多天，结果病情越来越恶化。不规则发烧，最高达摄氏四十一度；骨髓细胞发育受抑制；食欲减退，精神萎靡；脾脏肿大到十二公分，贫血加重。白血球已由入院时每立方厘米三千多个降为一千一百多个，红血球由三百一十万个降为二百八十一万个，血色素由60％减低到46％。病情恶化到这种地步，不宜再采取放射治疗和氮芥治疗。为了使病人在危急状态下仍然能够增强抗病能力，医院的内科主治医师李中才，决定继续给病人输血，积极挽救。但想到病人需血很多，而鲜血又太贵，他就想出用胎盘血代替鲜血。从3月10日开始不断注射（每天注射一次，每次十毫升），十天之后病情大有好转：贫血减轻，发烧减退，脾脏缩小，食欲增强，体重增加。只有淋巴腺仍然肿大。李中才继续给病人每天注射十毫升胎盘血。十八天以后，体温正常，淋巴腺也相继缩小了。两个月后全身症状全部消失，仅仅在左颔下可扪及一个如蚕豆大小的淋巴结（现患牙疾）。现在，病人仍然在继续注射胎盘血。
    重庆市的专家们在会上听了病理诊断、病案治疗报告，观看了患者切片检查的幻灯，参观病人之后，认为这项发现是中国医学上的一项创举。这项治疗效果是胎盘血的作用，还是偶合？专家们肯定认为不可能是偶合。理由是：（一）从注射胎盘血后临床各项症状的好转，可以断定其作用。同时治疗过程中，也曾一度因胎盘血供不应求而间歇注射，病情即刻变坏；恢复注射后马上又变好了。（二）根据第七军医大学和重庆医学院参加检查的几位专家分析说：从刚入院时的切片检查，整个淋巴结都被破坏，注射了胎盘血一个多月后，所作的第二、三次切片检查，无论从病变范围、细胞成分和恶化程度来看，都是由坏变好，由严重变轻微。
    专家们说，这种治疗方法有四大好处：（1）严重贫血和白血球减少到每立方厘米二千个以下，就不宜采用放射和氮芥治疗；而用胎盘血治疗就不受这种限制。（2）胎盘血到处都有，注射方法又简单，医务人员容易掌握，注射的设备既简单又经济。（3）肌肉注射胎盘血没有什么痛苦，不会发生副作用，病人也容易接受。
    专家们认为当前的关键问题是：如何进一步探讨胎盘血的使用问题。重庆市卫生局已决定立即成立一个科学研究小组，并设立用胎盘血治疗这种病的专门病床。
