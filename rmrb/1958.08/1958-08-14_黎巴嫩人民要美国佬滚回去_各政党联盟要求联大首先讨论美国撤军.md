　　Must Have US-British Aggressor Troops Withdraw from the Middle East
　　Lebanese People Want the American Bastards to Get Out
　　Coalition of Political Parties Demands UN General Assembly First Discuss US Troop Withdrawal
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 13th: The "symbolic withdrawal" of some of the invading US troops from Lebanon, a trick played by the United States to deceive public opinion and evade condemnation at the United Nations General Assembly, has failed to fool anyone naive here. The Lebanese people resolutely demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of US troops from their country.

    Just hours before this battalion of US troops began boarding ships today, a group of Lebanese residents distributed leaflets on a beach north of Beirut. The leaflets said: "American bastards get out! We vow: If the US military does not withdraw from our country in the shortest possible time, we would rather die than give up!"

    Lebanese opposition leader Saeb Salam reiterated that all occupying forces must completely withdraw from Lebanon. He said that while he welcomed "this symbolic step," "past experience and recent events have taught us to be cautious about such measures, especially since this step does not fully achieve the goal demanded by the Lebanese people of the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces."

    Prominent Lebanese lawyer Mohsen Slim said that the "statement made on the 12th by Holloway, commander of the invading US forces in Lebanon, that a battalion of US Marines would 'withdraw' from Lebanon 'does not mean in the slightest that the United States wants to withdraw from Lebanon.'" He said, "This statement, issued the day before the UN General Assembly meets, is just a stupid trick."

    Diplomats in Beirut generally believe that the US announcement of the "withdrawal" of some invading US troops is nothing more than a deceptive gesture, not the first step in an overall withdrawal plan.

    Residents of Beirut reacted indifferently to the news of the "withdrawal" of a battalion of US invading troops. They are not interested in this deceptive trick, because they see American soldiers still running around the streets of Beirut, acting recklessly.

    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 13th: According to newspapers here today, the Lebanese Coalition of Political Parties yesterday sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly's emergency special session first discuss the issue of the withdrawal of US occupation forces from Lebanon.

    The telegram stated, "The occupation of Lebanon by American troops constitutes a blatant violation of Lebanese independence, the United Nations Charter, and international law. Therefore, this is an issue that must be discussed first at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly."

    The telegram informed Hammarskjöld that the coalition announced to the United Nations: (1) It strongly condemns the American aggression against Lebanon; (2) It appeals to the United Nations in the name of international justice to stop this aggression and pass a resolution for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon; (3) It firmly believes that any delegation sent by the current government to attend the United Nations General Assembly has completely lost its legitimacy and the trust of the people, especially the delegation headed by Malik, which cannot represent the Lebanese people and the will of the people; (4) It insists that the Lebanese people's desire is to live in an independent and autonomous country, and that any solution made externally that does not respect Lebanon as a sovereign and free country, or violates its natural connection with the Arab world, will be rejected.

    The telegram emphasized that the United Nations has no right to manipulate the fate of a country to satisfy the demands of certain foreign countries.

    The Lebanese Coalition of Political Parties also strongly condemned the so-called proposals to "internationalize" and "neutralize" Lebanon in the telegram. It said, "News coming from New York regarding so-called proposals to resolve the Lebanese issue to be submitted to the United Nations has aroused strong indignation among the Lebanese people, especially those proposals to internationalize and neutralize Lebanon." The telegram pointed out that "such proposals can only serve foreign interests and are contrary to the meaning of the sovereignty and independence of United Nations member states."

### 黎巴嫩人民要美国佬滚回去　各政党联盟要求联大首先讨论美国撤军

　　一定要美英侵略军从中东撤走
　　黎巴嫩人民要美国佬滚回去
　　各政党联盟要求联大首先讨论美国撤军
    新华社贝鲁特13日电　美国为欺骗舆论和在联合国大会上逃避谴责而耍弄的部分侵黎美军“象征性撤出”的西洋镜，在这里未能蒙骗任何天真的人。黎巴嫩人民坚决要求美军立即全部撤出他们的国家。
    就在今天这一营美军开始登船的几小时以前，一群黎巴嫩居民在贝鲁特北部海滩散发了传单。这些传单说：“美国佬滚回去！我们宣誓：如果美军不在最短期间撤出我们的国家，我们宁死也决不罢休！”
    黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆重申要所有的占领军完全撤出黎巴嫩。他说，虽然我欢迎“这个象征性的步骤”，但是“过去的经验和最近的事件已经使我们懂得对这样的措施应当小心，特别因为这个步骤并没有充分实现黎巴嫩人民所要求的全部撤走所有占领军这个目标”。
    黎巴嫩著名律师莫辛·斯陵说，侵黎美军司令霍洛威12日发表的美国海军陆战队一个营将从黎巴嫩“撤出”的“声明一点也不意味着美国想要从黎巴嫩撤军”。他说，
  “在联合国大会开会的前一天发表的这个声明只是一个愚蠢的诡计”。
    贝鲁特外交人士普遍认为，美国宣布“撤出”部分侵黎美军，只不过是一种骗人的姿态，而不是整个撤军计划的第一步。
    贝鲁特的居民对“撤走”一营美国侵略军的消息表示冷淡，他们对这种骗人的西洋镜不感兴趣，因为他们看到美国兵照样还在贝鲁特大街上到处乱闯，胡作非为。
    新华社大马士革13日电　据此间报纸今天报道，黎巴嫩各政党联盟昨天致电联合国秘书长，要求联合国大会紧急特别会议首先讨论美国占领军撤出黎巴嫩问题。
    电报中说，“美国军队占领黎巴嫩构成了对黎巴嫩独立、联合国宪章和国际法的露骨破坏，因此这是联合国大会特别会议所必需首先讨论的问题。”
    电报通知哈马舍尔德说，这个联盟向联合国宣布：（一）它强烈指责美国侵略黎巴嫩；（二）它以国际正义的名义呼吁联合国制止这种的侵略并通过外国军队撤出黎巴嫩决议；（三）它坚决地认为由现政府派去参加联合国大会的任何代表团，完全失去它的合法性和人民的信任，特别是以马利克为首的代表团更不能代表黎巴嫩人民和人民的意志；（四）它坚持黎巴嫩人民的意愿是要在独立和自主的国家中生活，凡是由外部做出的不尊重黎巴嫩做为一个主权和自由的国家、或是违反它同阿拉伯世界的天然连系的任何解决办法，都将被拒绝。
    电文强调，联合国没有权利摆布一个国家的命运来满足某些外国的要求。
    黎巴嫩各政党联盟在电报中还强烈指责所谓把黎巴嫩“国际化”和“中立化”的建议。它说，“从纽约传来的关于提交给联合国的所谓要解决黎巴嫩问题的建议的消息，在黎巴嫩人民中间引起强烈的愤慨，特别是那些要把黎巴嫩国际化和中立化建议。”电报指出，“这种建议只能为外国利益服务，并与联合国成员国的主权和独立的含义相违背。”
