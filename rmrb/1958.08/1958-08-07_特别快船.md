    Special Express Ships
    The Yangtze River Navigation Administration, starting from August 4th, has deployed the newly manufactured and well-equipped large passenger ships "Jiangping" and "Jiangxin" to add special express liners to the Hankou-Shanghai route, making a round trip in five days. Among them, the downstream journey from Hankou to Shanghai takes forty-three hours and five minutes, and the upstream journey takes sixty-one hours and fifteen minutes. The ships stop at ports along the route including Huangshi, Jiujiang, Anqing, Tongguanshan, Wuhu, and Nanjing, with no increase in fares.
    Note: Before liberation, the round trip schedule for Shanghai-Hankou liners was ten days, which has been shortened to seven days after liberation. After the Great Leap Forward, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration organized two rapid navigation tests, using increased speed, utilizing flow velocity, improving port operations, and reducing berthing time to accelerate navigation speed, further shortening the Shanghai-Hankou liner round trip schedule to five days.

    特别快船
    长江航运管理局从8月4日起，调新近出厂、设备完善的“江平”和“江新”两艘大型客轮，在汉口至上海的航线上增辟特快班轮，五天跑一个来回。其中由汉口下水至上海航行四十三时零五分，上水航行六十一时十五分。沿线在黄石、九江、安庆、铜官山、芜湖、南京等港停泊，票价不增。
    按：申汉班轮往返航期解放前为十天，解放后已缩短为七天。大跃进后，长江航运管理局组织了两次快速航行试验，用大开车速，利用流速，改进港口作业，减少停泊时间等办法，加快了航行速度，使申汉班轮往返航期进一步缩短为五天。　　　　（张景福）
