Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 8th: The first session of the Second People's Congress of Shaanxi Province was held from July 28th to August 3rd.

Three hundred and sixty-four delegates listened to the government work report and other reports made by Governor Zhao Shoushan, and held enthusiastic discussions. More than ninety delegates spoke at the conference. These reports and speeches fully reflected the unprecedentedly high revolutionary enthusiasm of the people throughout the province, and the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production and other tasks. Since last October, the province has been engaged in a large-scale farmland water conservancy construction campaign, expanding the irrigated area by more than 18.12 million mu, equivalent to an increase of one mu of irrigated land per person in the province, and more than five times the 3.5 million mu of irrigated land built in the two thousand years before liberation. During the same period, mass soil and water conservation work was carried out in vast mountainous and plateau areas, with the construction of various types of projects controlling soil erosion over an area of more than 26,000 square kilometers, exceeding the original plan for this year by 30%. The province accumulated a total of 350 billion jin of fertilizer in the first half of the year, exceeding the total amount of fertilizer accumulated last year. This year's summer crops have had a bumper harvest, with a total output of more than 6.2 billion jin, including a total wheat output of about 5 billion jin, an increase of 11.5% over last year. A mass movement to reform agricultural implements is underway throughout the province. In the first half of this year, various agricultural implements created and improved in various places reached more than 6,700 kinds, with nearly one million pieces having already been promoted. Thanks to the whole people running industry in a big way, more than 38,000 factories and mines have been built and put into production in just over four months. More than a dozen counties, including Chang'an, Weinan, Wugong, and Dali, have each built more than 1,000 factories after a month of hard work. Now, the province is building an average of more than 460 factories every day. At present, most counties and cities have factories in every township and commune. A mass technological innovation movement among workers and staff is surging forward, with more than 10 million rationalization proposals put forward in the first half of the year, and inventions emerging one after another. More than 1,200 new products and more than 2,000 new varieties have been successfully trial-produced in the first half of the year. Transportation, commerce, and cultural and educational work are also developing rapidly.

The resolutions passed at the meeting pointed out that the main tasks of the people of the province at present are: to firmly grasp the three "marshals" of grain, steel, and machinery, and the two "vanguards" of transportation and electricity. At present, autumn crops are generally growing well throughout the province, and a bumper harvest is in sight. However, it is necessary to go all out in the coming months, mobilize the masses, and do everything possible to firmly grasp the later-stage management of autumn crops, especially for the few cotton fields and autumn fields that are relatively poor, and take forceful measures to quickly change their appearance. Launch a large-scale shock fertilizer accumulation movement to strive to accumulate one trillion jin of fertilizer before the autumn harvest and sowing, so as to achieve 10,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu of autumn cotton fields and 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of wheat fields. In order to strive for a bumper harvest next year, all preparations for sowing must be made with all efforts from now on. Another larger-scale water conservancy movement will be launched this winter and next spring. In addition, all wheat fields are required to be deep-plowed once, and idle land this winter should also be deep-plowed once.

The meeting pointed out that conservative ideas such as the current "tension theory," "conditions theory," and "fate theory" must be criticized in order to further implement the general line of socialist construction and promote the high-speed development of socialist construction. At the same time, the mass movement of studying and publicizing the general line, as well as the propaganda movement against US-British aggression in the Middle East and defending peace, must be further deepened. The meeting also adopted a telegram resolutely supporting the Chinese government's protest against the US armed aggression against Lebanon and the British armed aggression against Jordan.

This meeting was lively and vigorous. During the meeting, more than 200 delegates posted big-character posters, reflecting the leap-forward development of various tasks from all aspects, and expressing their determination to resolutely implement the spirit of the meeting. Some delegates also made criticisms and suggestions on the government's work in the big-character posters.

At the end of the meeting, Zhao Shoushan was elected as Governor by secret ballot, and Zhao Boping, Shi Yizhi, Li Qiming, Xie Huaide, Sun Weiru, Jing Yanzheng, Huang Jingbo, and Yang Zhengmin were elected as Deputy Governors. Mao Fengxiang was elected as the President of the Provincial Higher People's Court. Niu Shushen and thirty-two others were elected as members of the Provincial People's Committee. The meeting also elected twenty-seven deputies to the Second National People's Congress, who are: Xi Zhongxun, Ma Mingfang, Ma Pingfu, Fang Zhongru, Wang Baojing, Wang Juren, Wang Debiao, An Wenqin, Li Fenglian, Li Fuqing, Su Zichen, Yan Xinmin, Chen Daxie, Chen Yu'gao, Chen Jingyun, Zhang Shouyin, Zhang Jinju, Zhang Qiuxiang, Yue Jieheng, Zhao Zhankui, Zhao Boping, Zhao Shoushan, Tang Hongcheng, Yuan Zhengting, Han Wangchen, Yu Hongzheng, and Xiong Yingdong.

    三百六十四名代表听了省长赵寿山所作的政府工作报告和其他报告，并且进行了热烈的讨论。九十多名代表在大会上作了发言。这些报告和发言，充分反映出全省人民的革命干劲空前高涨，全省的工农业生产和其他各项工作有了飞跃发展。从去年10月至今，全省大搞兴修农田水利运动，扩大灌溉面积一千八百一十二万多亩，等于全省每人增加一亩水地，等于解放前两千多年所修水地三百五十多万亩的五倍多。同一时期，广大山区和高原地区展开了群众性的水土保持工作，修建的各类工程，可控制水土流失两万六千多平方公里，超过今年原计划的30％。全省上半年共积肥三千五百亿斤，超过去年积肥数量的总和。今年夏田作物获得大丰收，总产量达六十二亿多斤，其中小麦总产量五十亿斤左右，比去年增产11.5％。群众性的农具改革运动正在全省展开。今年上半年各地创造和改良的各种农具达六千七百多种，已推广的近一百万件。由于全民大办工业，四个多月来已建成并且投入生产的厂矿就有三万八千多个。长安、渭南、武功、大荔等十多个县都是苦战一月各建成工厂一千个以上。现在全省每天平均建成四百六十多个工厂。目前大部分县市已是乡乡、社社都有工厂。职工群众性的技术革新运动风起云涌，上半年共提出合理化建议达一千多万条，创造发明层出不穷。上半年试制成功的新产品达一千二百多种，各种新花色品种两千多种。交通运输、商业和文化教育等项工作也都在飞跃发展。

    会议指出：对当前一些“紧张论”、“条件论”、“天定论”等保守思想，必须批判，以进一步贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，促进社会主义建设事业的高速度发展。同时，必须把群众性的学习、宣传总路线的运动，以及反对美英侵略中东、保卫和平的宣传运动，进一步深入地开展起来。会议还通过了关于坚决拥护我国政府抗议美国武装侵略黎巴嫩和英国武装侵略约旦的通电。
    这次会议开得生动活泼，会议期间，有二百多名代表张贴了大字报，从各方面反映了各项工作飞跃发展的面貌，表示他们坚决贯彻会议精神的决心。有些代表在大字报上还对政府工作提出了批评和意见。
