Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, August 3rd. Under the new situation of the flying development of all construction undertakings in the country, how the power industry can quickly catch up and play the role of "pioneer" is the central topic of the National Hydropower Operation On-Site Conference recently held by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power at the Fengman Hydropower Plant in Jilin Province.

The meeting pointed out that China's hydropower industry will enter a new period of great development during the Second Five-Year Plan. At the meeting, representatives of various hydropower plants discussed the new situation and new tasks, and put forward new leap forward plans. The Guanting Hydropower Plant proposed to contract all production, operation, and partial installation tasks of the hydropower plants to be built in the five major river systems, including the Yongding River in Hebei Province, during the Second Five-Year Plan. All old hydropower plants jointly proposed to train a complete set of technical backbones for the nearly two hundred new hydropower plants to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan. Among them, the Fengman Hydropower Plant plans to train eighteen sets of technical backbones for large-scale hydropower plants, and immediately prepare to manufacture its own hydro-turbine generators to support the construction of new plants in various places. The meeting believed that in order to strive for the high-speed development of the power industry and realize the national hydropower leap forward plan, it is necessary to adopt the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods to implement mass mobilization in running the power industry. The meeting determined several measures and methods for building the hydropower industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way: (1) Implement the policy of mass mobilization in running the power industry, with self-reliance as the main focus. All levels are responsible for contracting the construction of hydropower plants. In addition to small rural hydropower plants run by townships and communities, hydropower plants with a general capacity of 500 kilowatts to 10,000 kilowatts can be planned by counties in conjunction with irrigation, flood control, and industrial needs, and be responsible for construction; the construction of medium-sized hydropower plants with a capacity of about 10,000 kilowatts to 100,000 kilowatts can generally be headed by special districts, with provinces (cities) providing support; the construction of large-scale hydropower projects should be led by the provinces in a unified manner; as for extra-large hydropower plants, especially comprehensive water conservancy hubs (such as Sanmenxia, ​​etc.) involving the irrigation, flood control, and industrial deployment of several provinces, the central departments and relevant provinces and cities will jointly be responsible for construction. (2) Production plants (old plants) contract a part of capital construction, contract installation, contract production management, and are responsible for expanding or preparing to build new plants. (3) Streamline institutions and gradually increase the degree of automation, reduce personnel quotas by half, double the training tasks, and provide sufficient technical strength for new plants. (4) Break the routine in hydropower design work, decentralize power, and implement the mass line. According to the experience of various plants, after the design power is decentralized, the project cost and design time can be reduced by one-half to three-quarters compared with the First Five-Year Plan period. (5) Develop "all-rounders," engage in both main and side occupations, both operation and maintenance, both maintenance and installation and manufacturing. Under the principle of ensuring safe production and construction, actively manufacture power generation equipment, comprehensively utilize the resources of various plants, and promote one plant with multiple capabilities, one object with multiple uses, and one person with multiple skills. (6) Strengthen internal and external collaboration, carry out scientific research, especially strengthen on-site research in various plants, and solve various key problems.

The meeting also exchanged and summarized the experiences of various hydropower plants in safe and economical operation over the past eight years, production preparation for new plants, and technical revolution. The Fengman Hydropower Plant has been operating safely for more than 340 consecutive days. The Guanting and Sichuan Changshou (i.e., Shizitan Cascade) Hydropower Plants also have relatively good safe and economical operation. These three power plants introduced their experience in safe production at the meeting. Their experience proves that the key to safe production work is to give play to the role of political command, combine it with various political movements, and strengthen ideological education on safe production for employees. The Foziling, Guanting, and Fengman Hydropower Plants introduced their experiences in production preparation for new plants, water conservancy construction management, and reservoir dispatch.

More than 100 party and government leading cadres, advanced producers, professors, and engineers from 44 units including water conservancy and electric power departments, hydropower plants, hydropower science research institutes, design departments, and universities from all provinces and cities across the country attended the meeting.

    力争高速度发展电力工业
    全国水电运行现场会议确定土洋结合全民动手的具体措施
    据新华社吉林3日电　在全国各项建设事业飞跃发展的新形势下，电力工业如何迅速迎头赶上，发挥“先行官”的作用，是水利电力部最近在吉林省丰满水电厂召开的全国水电运行现场会议的中心议题。
    会议指出，我国水力发电工业在第二个五年计划期间将进入一个新的大发展的时期。在会议上，各个水电厂的代表讨论了新的形势和新的任务后，纷纷提出了新的跃进规划。官厅水电厂提出，在第二个五年计划期间要把河北省永定河等五大河系所建设的水电厂全部生产运行和部分安装任务包下来。各老水电厂共提出为第二个五年计划期间新建的近二百个水电厂，培训全套技术骨干，其中丰满水电厂计划为大型水电厂培训出十八套技术骨干，并立即筹备自制水轮发电机，支援各地建设新厂。会议认为，要力争高速度发展电力工业，实现全国水电大跃进计划，必须采取土洋结合的办法实行全民办电力工业。会议确定了几项多快好省地建设水电工业的措施和办法：（一）贯彻全民办电力工业的方针，以自力更生为主，各级层层包干负责建设水电厂，除农村小型水电厂由乡社自办外，一般容量在五百瓩以上、一万瓩以下的水电厂，可由县结合灌溉、防洪及工业需要，统一规划，负责施工；容量在一万瓩至十万瓩左右的中型水电厂的建设，一般可由专区挂帅，省（市）支援；大型水电工程的建设，由省统一领导；至于特大型水电厂，特别是牵涉到几个省的灌溉、防洪和工业布署的综合利用水利枢纽（如三门峡等），则由中央部门与有关省、市共同负责建设。（二）生产厂（老厂）包一部分基本建设，包安装、包生产管理，并负责扩建或筹建新厂。（三）紧缩机构并逐步提高自动化的程度，人员定额减少一半，培训任务翻二番，为新厂提供足够的技术力量。（四）水电设计工作打破常规，权力下放，贯彻群众路线。根据各厂经验，设计权力下放后，工程造价和设计时间可比第一个五年计划期间减少二分之一至四分之三。（五）发展“多面手”，正业兼副业，运行兼检修，检修兼安装和制造，在保证安全生产和建设的原则下，积极制造发电设备，综合利用各厂资源，提倡一厂多能，一物多用，一人多艺。（六）加强内外协作，开展科学研究，特别是加强各厂现场研究工作，解决各种关键问题。
    会议还交流和总结了各水电厂八年来安全经济运行、新厂生产准备、技术革命等方面的经验。丰满水电厂已连续安全运行三百四十多天。官厅、四川长寿（即狮子滩梯级）水电厂安全经济运行也比较好。这三个电厂在会上介绍了安全生产经验。它们的经验证明，安全生产工作，主要是发挥政治统帅的作用，结合各项政治运动，对职工们加强安全生产思想教育工作。佛子岭、官厅、丰满等水电厂介绍了新厂生产准备、水工建筑管理、水库调度等经验。
    参加这次会议的有全国各省市水利电力部门、水电厂、水电科学研究院、设计部门和高等学校共四十四个单位的党政负责干部、先进生产者、教授、工程师等一百多人。
