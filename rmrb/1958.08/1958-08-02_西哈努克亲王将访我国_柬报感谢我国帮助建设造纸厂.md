    柬报感谢我国帮助建设造纸厂
    新华社1日讯　柬埔寨王国政府首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王应中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来的邀请，将于1958年内率领政府代表团前来中国作第二次友好访问。
    诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王第一次访问中国是在1956年2月，当时曾同周恩来总理举行会谈并共同发表了和平共处五项原则的联合声明，使中柬两国的传统友好关系获得了恢复和发展。
    据新华社金边31日电　柬埔寨“自由人民”周刊今天在评论中国专家们已经选定了中国援助建设的造纸厂厂址的消息时说，柬埔寨感谢人民中国的援助，因为这种援助应该有助于柬埔寨的经济独立，是无私的援助。在这个造纸厂建成后，有些柬埔寨人就能够在那里找到工作，而所生产的纸张就能够满足市场的需要。“友好报”今天也为这件事而欢呼。
