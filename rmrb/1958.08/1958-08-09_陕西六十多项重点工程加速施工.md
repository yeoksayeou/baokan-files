    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th - While vigorously developing medium and small-scale local industries, Shaanxi Province is also constructing a batch of large-scale key projects. In Xi'an, Baoji, Xingping, Tongchuan, Xianyang and other places, more than sixty key projects are now entering a construction high tide. The completed power capacitor factory and five large machinery factories, as well as the State-owned No. 6 Cotton Mill, have all recently officially started production.

    The biggest characteristic of Shaanxi Province's key project construction this year is the addition of backbone industries that have never existed locally, such as iron and steel, heavy machinery, non-ferrous metals, cement, and chemical fertilizers. While the construction of medium and small-scale metallurgical industries is flourishing everywhere, the Xi'an Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise and the Baoji Steel Pipe Factory have both started construction. More than twenty new and renovated machinery industry projects are under construction, and in the second half of the year, several more machinery factories of various types will be newly built. These machinery factories will manufacture various heavy machinery, pneumatic tools, metallurgical equipment, chemical equipment, boilers, textile machinery, electric motors and other products that could not be manufactured in the Shaanxi area in the past.

    In order to cooperate with the local large-scale industrial construction, the construction scale of the coal and power industries, as a pioneering industry, is also larger than any previous year. At the same time as small coal mines are being established everywhere, six new coal shafts with a total annual production capacity of more than 3 million tons are under intense construction in the Tongchuan mining area of the Weibei Coalfield, and some are nearing completion. There are seven newly built and expanded thermal power plants and power transmission and transformation projects in the power industry. The Xi'an-Baoji transmission line, which has already started construction, is extending westward beyond Xingping. Xi'an, Baoji and the Weibei area will also begin to expand and build new power plants in the second half of the year.

    陕西六十多项重点工程加速施工
    新华社西安8日电  陕西省在大办中、小型地方工业的同时，正在兴建一批大型重点工程。西安、宝鸡、兴平、铜川、咸阳等地，目前已有六十多项重点工程进入施工高潮。已建成的电力电容器厂和五个大型机械厂、国棉六厂，都在最近先后正式生产。
    今年陕西省重点工程建设的最大特点是，增建了当地从来没有过的钢铁、重型机械、有色金属、水泥、化肥等骨干工业。在中、小型冶金工业建设遍地开花的同时，西安钢铁联合企业、宝鸡钢管厂都已开工。二十多项新建和改建的机械工业项目正在施工，下半年新增建的，还有多座各种机械厂。这些机器厂要制造陕西地区过去不能制造的各种重型机械、风动工具、冶金设备、化工设备、锅炉、纺织机械、电动机等产品。
    为了配合当地大规模工业建设，作为先行工业的煤炭和电力工业的建设规模，也比以往任何一年都大，与遍地建立的小煤窑同时，渭北煤田的铜川矿区有六对年产能力共三百多万吨的新煤井正在紧张施工，有的已临竣工阶段。电力工业新建和扩建的火电厂、输变电工程有七项。已开工的西安——宝鸡输电线路，正在越过兴平向西伸延。西安、宝鸡和渭北地区，下半年也将开始扩建和新建发电厂。
