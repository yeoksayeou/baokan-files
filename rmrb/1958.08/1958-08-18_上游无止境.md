Title: The Upstream Has No End

　　Some people have raised the question: "Every day we talk about going all out, aiming high, and striving for the upstream. Where exactly is the upstream?" In other words, "Is there an end to the upstream?"

　　There are roughly two types of people who raise this question, with two different purposes. One type of person wants to explore the ultimate nature of objective things and is motivated by the pursuit of truth. The other type of person hides a certain kind of thinking behind the question mark, which is the hope that the upstream has an end, so that after reaching it, they can raise their pillows high and take a good sleep.

　　The "upstream" mentioned in our General Line is different from the upstream in geography; it refers to being the first and being advanced. To go all out, aim high, and strive for the upstream in socialist construction means striving to be the first and striving to be advanced.

　　The first and the advanced are constantly changing. Today's first place may become second or something lower than second tomorrow; what is advanced today may become intermediate or backward tomorrow. For example, the quality of enamel products has always been the best in Shanghai, and everyone has been learning from Shanghai and catching up with Shanghai. However, in March and April, the young Xi'an Enamel Factory surpassed Shanghai and became the national number one; in May and June, Shanghai surpassed Xi'an again. Recently, the Xi'an Enamel Factory has been catching up rapidly and has surpassed Shanghai again, regaining the national number one position. Does this mean that the product quality has reached its peak and will never improve again? No. Everything is always developing in the struggle of internal contradictions, and industrial production is no exception. In this endless struggle, the advanced are constantly surpassed by the more advanced, there are heavens beyond heavens, and there is a first place above the first place, one layer higher than another. The emergence of the advanced and the shift of the upstream position are signals of the development of productive forces and social progress. To say that advanced indicators never change, and that the upstream has an end, is tantamount to saying that the development of productive forces and social progress have an end. This violates the objective laws of the development of things.

　　Perhaps some people will say: "Great! Since the upstream has no end and advanced indicators are infinitely variable, then what is the point of setting advanced indicators? Why not simply not set any indicators, and just strive for the upstream and go wherever we get to!" This kind of thinking is wrong. We say that the upstream has no end, but this does not negate the role of advanced indicators. Advanced indicators can keep people's thoughts and spirits in a state of combat mobilization. This principle has been proven by countless facts. In the long journey of developing production, every leap forward is only the starting point of a new leap forward, not the end of a leap forward. Therefore, when we temporarily strive for the upstream, we must not be complacent or sleep soundly, but must continue to revolutionize and move forward forever.

　　Today, the changes in the upstream are particularly rapid. What determines who is in the upstream, who is in the midstream, and who is in the downstream is people's drive, people's communist style of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to be original, and people's subjective dynamic role. Whoever has the greatest drive, the highest communist style, and the most fully developed subjective dynamic role will strive for the upstream. Conversely, they will be washed downstream and fall far behind the times.

### 上游无止境

　　上游无止境
　　王朴
    有人提出一个问题：“天天讲鼓足干劲，力争上游，上游到底在哪里呀？”换句话说，就是“上游有没有止境呀？”
    提出这个问题的，大致有两种人，抱着两种不同的目的。一种人是想探索客观事物的究竟，是出于对真理的追求。另一种人在问号的背后隐藏着一种思想，就是希望上游有个止境，以便走到那里以后，把枕头升得高高的睡个大觉。
    我们总路线里所讲的“上游”跟地理学上的上游是不同的，是指第一，是指先进。在社会主义建设中鼓足干劲，力争上游，就是力争第一，力争先进。
    第一和先进是经常起变化的。今天的第一，到明天就可能变为第二或者比第二更低的什么了；今天是先进的东西，明天可能就变为中间的或者落后的东西。如搪瓷产品的质量，历来都是上海的最好，大家都学上海、赶上海。可是，在3、4月间，年轻的西安搪瓷厂赶过了上海，变为全国第一；5、6月间上海又赶过西安，到最近，西安搪瓷厂急起直追，又赶过了上海，重新夺得全国第一。产品质量，到这里是否就算到了顶，永远不再提高了呢？不。任何事物永远在内部矛盾的斗争中发展着，工业生产也不能例外。在这个无尽期的斗争中，先进的不断被更先进的超过，天外有天，第一上面又有第一，顶尖上面冒出顶尖，一层高过一层。先进的出现，上游位置的转移，是生产力发展和社会进步的信号。说先进指标永远不变，说上游有止境，就等于说生产力发展和社会进步有止境。这是违反事物发展的客观规律的。
    也许有人会说：“好啊！既然上游没有止境，先进指标变化无穷，那么，订先进指标有什么意义呢？不如干脆什么指标也不订，反正努力向上游，游到哪儿算哪儿吧！”这种想法是不对的。我们说上游无止境，并不是否定先进指标的作用。先进指标可以使人们的思想和精神处于战斗的动员状态。这个道理已被无数的事实证明了。在发展生产的万里征途中，每一个跃进，都只是新的跃进的起点，而不是跃进的终点。因此，当我们暂时争得上游的时候，不要自满，不要睡大觉，而要不断革命，永远前进。
    今天，上游的变化特别迅速。决定谁在上游、谁在中游、谁在下游的，是人们的干劲，是人们的敢想、敢干、敢独创的共产主义风格，是人们主观能动作用。谁的干劲最足，共产主义风格最高，主观能动作用发挥得最充分，谁就争得上游。相反，就会被冲到下游，远远地落在时代后面。
