Title: Bayonets and "Good Intentions"

    American aggressors still want to put on two faces to deal with the Arab people who are striving for national independence: one face is hideous and frightening, and the other face reveals "good intentions."

    It is said that the number of U.S. troops invading Lebanon will increase to 15,000 by the 6th, which is exactly one and a half times the number of the Lebanese government army. The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon also announced that there would be several thousand more landing troops following. Batch after batch of invading troops have landed and have even gone to the border between Lebanon and the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic. This is, of course, an aggressive posture, a posture to make the Arab people submit.

    At the same time, Murphy, the veteran American conspirator who has been conducting intense activities in Beirut, Amman, and Tel Aviv as a special envoy of the U.S. President, has already gone to Baghdad to lie and deceive, and is preparing to go to Cairo, as the Cairo "Al Ahram" said, intending to "promote America's good intentions" to Arab countries. This is a face of sweet words.

    First bayonets, then goodwill; or first goodwill, then bayonets, no matter how the face of the American pirates changes, there is only one intention—to maintain colonial rule in the Middle East. What makes the aggressors sad is that this two-faced trick has no market. The Cairo "Al Ahram" is right, "As long as U.S. troops remain in the Middle East, we will not believe him (referring to Murphy)."

### 刺刀和“善意”

    刺刀和“善意”
    美国侵略者还想装出两付面孔来对付争取民族独立的阿拉伯人民：一付面孔是狰狞吓人，另一付面孔则露出“善良用意”。
    据说侵黎美军到6日即将增加到一万五千人，这个数字不多不少恰是黎巴嫩政府军的一倍半。美国驻黎大使还宣布，后续登陆部队还要有几千名。一批接一批的侵略军登陆了，还开到黎巴嫩和阿联叙利亚地区的边境上去。这当然是一种咄咄逼人的姿态，要阿拉伯人民屈服的姿态。
    与此同时，以美总统特使身份先后在贝鲁特、安曼和特拉维夫进行紧张活动的美国老牌阴谋家墨菲，已经到巴格达撒谎行骗一番，还准备去开罗，正如开罗“晚报”所说的，打算向阿拉伯国家“宣传美国的善良用意”。这是一付甜言蜜语的面孔。
    先刺刀，后善意；或则先善意，后刺刀，美国海盗的面孔无论怎样变化，居心只有一个——维护在中东的殖民主义统治。使得侵略者悲哀的是这种两面伎俩找不到市场。开罗“晚报”说得对，“只要美军仍然驻在中东，我们是不会相信他（指墨菲）的”。
