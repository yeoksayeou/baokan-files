Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The Supreme People's Procuratorate recently convened the Fourth National Procuratorial Work Conference. Based on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the conference summarized the experiences and lessons of procuratorial work over the past eight years and more, and further clarified the future tasks and the direction of the Great Leap Forward for procuratorial work.

During the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China received all the representatives; Comrades Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, and Luo Ruiqing spoke at the meeting and gave important instructions on procuratorial work. The conference lasted fifty-five days, with more than three hundred participants. At the closing meeting on the 16th, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng delivered a summary report of the conference.

The conference used the methods of airing views freely, great debate, and big-character posters to conduct theoretical discussions and summarize the experiences and lessons of procuratorial work over the past eight years and more, especially the three years since the promulgation of the Constitution. The conference held that over the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, procuratorial organs across the country have actively participated in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the struggle to combat criminal elements, striking at the enemy and punishing crime, playing an important role in safeguarding the smooth development of the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and achieving great success. The conference also pointed out that, judging from the experiences and lessons learned from procuratorial work over the past eight years, procuratorial organs must be a powerful weapon for exercising dictatorship over the enemy, must absolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the mass line, and must cooperate and check each other with the courts and public security departments to ensure the accurate and timely use of legal weapons to strike at the enemy.

This conference focused on the question of how to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution in procuratorial work, and how to implement the Party's general line of socialist construction and defend the general line. It conducted full discussions and further clarified the future tasks of procuratorial work. This task is to concretely implement the spirit of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism into procuratorial work, so that the procuratorial organs, as a component of the superstructure, can better adapt to the rapidly developing economic foundation of our country, and strive to safeguard the smooth realization of the general line and to build a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in our country.

The representatives also seriously studied the current situation of class struggle, and believed that the current main task of the procuratorial organs should be to strike at current sabotage activities and safeguard the central work of the Party and the state. The conference required procuratorial organs at all levels to firmly grasp this key link, promptly participate directly in the central work of each period according to the policies of the Party and the state, take effective measures to strike at all kinds of current sabotage activities, and make significant achievements in safeguarding the central work of the Party.

Many representatives at the conference spoke at the plenary session about the leap forward in local procuratorial work, believing that the procuratorial organs had made great achievements in the Great Leap Forward. In the Great Leap Forward, procuratorial personnel also overcame some bad styles of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and adopted methods such as handling cases in rural areas with files, handling cases on the spot, and following shifts in factories and mines to handle cases when conditions were necessary and possible, so that procuratorial work closely followed the development of actual struggles, implemented the mass line, and effectively struck at the enemy.

The conference held that procuratorial work must continue to leap forward, and only by continuously leaping forward can it better safeguard the smooth realization of the general line of socialist construction. The direction of the leap forward in procuratorial work determined by the conference is: to ensure a safest environment for the smooth realization of the general line by strengthening the dictatorship over the enemy. The requirements for procuratorial work in handling cases are: "accurate, timely, and legal," and this slogan is the specific embodiment of the spirit of "greater, faster, better, and more economical" in procuratorial work. The key to achieving this requirement lies in ensuring quality, accurately and timely striking at the enemy's sabotage activities, and sanctioning all other illegal and criminal acts.

The procuratorial organs, the courts, and the public security departments cooperate and check each other, and are a whole for strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. The procuratorial organs and these departments have always cooperated well. The conference required procuratorial organs at all levels to carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation, further cooperate closely with public security, the courts, and other departments under the leadership of the Party committees, strengthen the dictatorship over the enemy, and safeguard the interests of the people; at the same time, it also required procuratorial organs at all levels to better cooperate with the work of industry, agriculture, culture, and education, so that not only can procuratorial work better serve the work in all aspects, but it can also gain support from all aspects for procuratorial work and better perform procuratorial work.

　　运用法律武器　加强对敌专政
    为实现总路线创造安全环境
    全国检察工作会议确定今后任务和大跃进方向
    新华社24日讯　最高人民检察院最近召开了第四次全国检察工作会议。会议根据中共“八大”第二次会议的精神，总结了八年多以来检察工作的经验教训，进一步明确了检察工作的今后任务和大跃进的方向。
    会议期间，毛泽东主席和中共中央其他领导人接见了全体代表；董必武、彭真、罗瑞卿等同志到会讲了话，对检察工作作了重要指示。这个会议历时五十五天，参加会议的有三百多人。在16日的闭幕会上，张鼎丞检察长作了会议的总结报告。
    会议用大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的整风方法进行务虚，总结了八年多以来、特别是宪法颁布后三年多以来检察工作的经验教训。会议认为，八年多来，全国检察机关在党中央和各级党委的领导下积极参加了肃反斗争和打击刑事犯罪分子的斗争，打击了敌人，惩罚了犯罪，对于保障社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的顺利发展起了重要的作用，取得了很大的成绩。会议并指出，从八年多来检察工作取得的经验教训来看，检察机关必须是一个强有力的对敌人实行专政的武器，必须绝对依靠党的领导、坚决贯彻群众路线，必须同法院、公安部门互相配合、互相制约，保证准确、及时运用法律武器打击敌人。
    这次会议以在检察工作方面，如何把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合、如何贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和保卫总路线的问题为中心，进行了充分的讨论，进一步明确了检察工作的今后任务。这个任务是：把党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的精神，具体贯彻到检察工作中去，使作为上层建筑一个组成部分的检察机关，更好地适应我国正在飞跃发展的经济基础，为保卫总路线的顺利实现，为在我国建立一个具有现代工业，现代农业，现代科学、文化的、强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    到会代表还认真研究了目前阶级斗争的形势，认为检察机关当前主要的工作应该是打击现行破坏活动，保卫党和国家的中心工作。会议要求各级检察机关必须紧紧掌握这个环节，及时根据党和国家的政策，直接参加每个时期的中心工作，采取有力措施，打击各种现行破坏活动，在保卫党的中心工作方面做出显著的成绩。
    到会的许多代表在大会发言中都谈了当地检察工作的跃进情况，认为检察机关在大跃进中取得了很大的成绩。检察工作人员在大跃进中也克服了某些脱离群众、脱离实际的不良作风，并且在情况必要和可能条件下采用了携卷下乡办案、就地办案、下厂矿跟班办案等，使检察工作紧紧地跟着实际斗争的发展，贯彻群众路线，有力地打击了敌人。
    会议认为，检察工作还必须继续跃进，只有不断跃进，才能更好地保卫社会主义建设总路线的顺利实现。会议确定的检察工作的跃进方向是：通过加强对敌人的专政，为总路线的顺利实现保证一个最安全的环境。检察工作在办案上的要求是：“准确，及时，合法”，这个口号也就是“多快好省”的精神在检察工作上的具体体现。而实现这个要求的关键在于保证质量，准确地及时地打击敌人的破坏活动，和制裁其他一切违法犯罪的行为。
    检察机关和法院、公安部门是互相配合、互相制约的，是加强无产阶级专政的一个整体。检察机关和这些部门一直是配合得比较好的。会议要求各级检察机关应发扬共产主义的协作精神，在党委领导下，进一步和公安、法院等部门密切合作，加强对敌人的专政、保卫人民群众的利益；同时还要求各级检察机关和工农业、文教事业等方面的工作更好地协作，做到不仅使检察工作更好地为各方面的工作服务，而且也能取得各方面对检察工作的支持，更好地做好检察工作。
