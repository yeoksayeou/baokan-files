    Train Crew Makes Full Use of Waste Products
    In the high tide of comparing drive and reforming, the eight passenger train crews of the Xi'an Train Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration have achieved complete self-sufficiency in all cleaning tools for the train crew. Not only do they not ask the state for money, but they also turn in profits.
    In the past, waste products such as cigarette butts, waste paper boxes, and empty bottles cleaned out of the carriages, as well as leftover food from the dining car, were all discarded as garbage. During the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, the comrades of the passenger train crew thought: In addition to further improving the quality of service, could the train crew also transform consumption into increased production? Finally, they realized that they could collect all kinds of waste products cleaned from the carriages each time and sell them to waste product recycling departments, and extract oil from leftover soup, which would both support industrial production and provide funds for purchasing cleaning tools. In addition, they also sold various magazines such as "Red Flag" on commission, which on the one hand met the needs of passengers, and on the other hand increased income.
    In order to save expenses, they also implemented a system of assigning responsibility for cleaning supplies to each car and person. They did what they could themselves. In this way, in June, not only were the carriage cleaning supplies completely self-sufficient, but they also turned in 129 yuan.

    包乘组充分利用废品
    郑州铁路管理局西安列车段八个客运包乘组在比干劲比改革的高潮中，作到了车班全部清洁工具完全自给自足，不但不向国家要钱，还要上缴利润。
    过去，凡是车厢里清扫出来的烟头、废纸盒和空瓶等废品、餐车上的剩饭菜都当做垃圾倒掉。在大跃进高潮中，客运包乘组的同志们想：除了进一步提高服务质量外，包乘组是不是也可以变消费为增产呢？最后，他们终于想到，把每次从车厢里清扫出来的各种废品收集起来，卖给废品回收部门，从剩菜汤中提炼油，这样既支援了工业生产，又有了购买清洁工具的资金。另外，他们还代销“红旗”等各种杂志，一方面满足了旅客的要求，另一方面又增加了收入。
    为了节省开支，他们还对清洁用具实行了分车分人包干负责制度。有些能自己做的就自己动手做。就这样，在6月份，不但车厢清洁用具完全达到了自给自足，还上缴了一百二十九元。
