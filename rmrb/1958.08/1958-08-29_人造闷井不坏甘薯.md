Several Sweet Potato Storage Methods

　　Artificial "Suffocating Well" Prevents Sweet Potato Spoilage

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when I was home investigating sweet potato storage methods, everyone said that natural "suffocating wells" (meaning that the air in the well cellar is suffocating) would not spoil sweet potatoes. To conduct an artificial "suffocating well" experiment, I left one of the four well cellars in Zhai Chaoxuan's home in Shu Zhaiwan Village, Qingfeng County, Henan Province. After the stored sweet potatoes had sweated, I put a basin of charcoal in it, lit it, and then sealed the wellhead, leaving only a small hole. The idea was to increase the carbon dioxide in the cellar and turn it into a "suffocating well." The other three well cellars were stored according to the usual method. When taking sweet potatoes, I took them from the latter three well cellars first. When the sweet potatoes in the latter three well cellars had all spoiled, I opened the first well cellar and saw that not only had the sweet potatoes not spoiled, but also many nodules had grown on the sweet potato tubers. At that time, it was immediately thought that this was because of the suffocation in the artificial "suffocating well." However, after opening the well, it was not sealed as tightly as it was when it was first stored, nor was any more burning charcoal put in. After a while, the sweet potatoes spoiled again. After repeatedly investigating the cause of the spoilage, I suddenly realized that the reason why the "suffocating well" did not spoil the sweet potatoes was not because of the suffocation, but because the temperature inside the cellar was raised by burning charcoal. When the wellhead was not sealed so tightly after opening the well, the air circulated, and the temperature inside the cellar dropped, so the sweet potatoes spoiled again. After recognizing this principle, the farmers in Xi Zhaiwan Village used this principle. When taking sweet potatoes, they always brought a handful of wheat straw, lit the wheat straw, and then left the well and sealed the wellhead. In this way, sweet potatoes have not spoiled there for more than ten years. Later, after reading the magazines of the Beijing Agricultural Research Institute and the Shandong Agricultural Research Institute, they both proved through experiments that sweet potato black rot bacteria will not develop and reproduce above 10 degrees Celsius, which further proves that my artificial "suffocating well" experiment in the countryside is reasonable.　　Chen Duzhi

专栏：几种窖藏甘薯的办法

　　人造闷井不坏甘薯
    抗战期间我在回家调查甘薯储存法时，人人都说天然闷井（意思是井窖内闷气窒息）不会坏红薯。为了进行人造闷井试验，我曾在河南清丰县束翟湾村翟朝选家的四个井窖内留一个井窖，在储存的甘薯发汗之后，放进一脸盆木炭点着然后封井口，封时只留一个小窟窿。意思是增加窖内的二氧化碳叫它变成闷井，其余三个井窖照常法储存。取用甘薯时先取用后三个井窖的。等到后三个井窖的甘薯都坏了，揭开第一个井窖一看，不止甘薯没有坏，而且在薯块上还长出了不少疙瘩，当时即认为这是因为人造闷井息窒的缘故。可是开井之后没有像以前初储存时封井封的那末严，也没有继续放入点着的木炭，隔了不久甘薯又坏了。反复推求致坏的原因，始恍然大悟，闷井之所以不坏甘薯，不是因为闷气窒息，而是井内点着木炭，窖内温度提高的缘故。等到开井之后井口不封那末严，空气流通了，窖内气温降低了，所以甘薯又坏了。认清这个原理之后，西翟湾村农民利用这个原理在取用甘薯时，每次都带着一把麦秸，点着麦秸然后出井封井口，这样那里已经十几年不坏甘薯了。后来阅读北京农研所和山东农研所的杂志，它们都试验证明甘薯的黑斑病菌在摄氏十度以上是不会发育繁殖的，这更证明我在乡间的人造闷井试验是有道理的。　　陈笃之
