    Fiberglass Offshore Yacht

    (Our report) Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory successfully trial-produced a large fiberglass offshore yacht, which was launched ahead of schedule at 2:00 PM on July 30th. After more than three hours of trial sailing, the situation was good.

    This fiberglass offshore yacht is eight meters long and two meters wide, equipped with a 75-horsepower internal combustion engine, and can carry about twenty people.

    None of the employees of Yaohua Glass Factory understood shipbuilding technology. With the help of employees' families and Qinhuangdao No. 1 Middle School, they completed the trial production of the fiberglass yacht in seven days. During the trial production process, the employees broke with the regulations in books and boldly used domestically produced cold-setting phenolic resin to replace ester resin, which is about 80% cheaper.

    Using fiberglass to build ships is convenient for manufacturing, the hull is strong, the repair is convenient, and it is also of great significance for national defense.

    Currently, the employees of Yaohua Glass Factory are trial-producing various profiles such as fiberglass pit props in order to save the country steel and wood.

    玻璃钢海上游艇
    本报讯　秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂试制大型的玻璃钢海上游艇成功，已于7月30日下午二时提前下水。经过三小时以上长时间的试航，情况良好。
    这艘玻璃钢海上游艇，长八公尺，宽二公尺，装有七十五马力的内燃机，可乘二十人左右。
    耀华玻璃厂没有一个职工懂得造船技术，他们在职工家属、秦皇岛市第一中学的帮助下，用七天时间完成了玻璃钢游艇的试制任务。试制过程中，职工们打破书本上的规定，大胆地用国产冷固性酚醛树脂代替了联酯树脂，价格低80％左右。
    用玻璃钢造船，制造方便，船壳坚固，修补便利，在国防上也有重要意义。
    目前，耀华玻璃厂职工正在试制用玻璃钢造的坑柱等各种型材，以便为国家节省钢材和木材。
