Seize the Opportunity to Organize a Ten Thousand Person Inspection Team, Go Deep into the Fields and Conscientiously Grasp Autumn Field Management

    (Our report) The provinces and regions of Central South and the provinces and regions of Northwest China will organize ten-thousand-person inspection and evaluation teams, implementing a method of six-level cadre convergence from province, special district, county, district, township, and commune. They will go deep into the fields to vigorously grasp autumn field management, and they will not leave the fields until they achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn.

    The agricultural cooperation conferences held successively in the provinces and regions of Central South and the provinces and regions of Northwest China in July all made the following decisions: In order to strive for a greater autumn harvest, each province and region will, in the decisive next two or three months of August, September and October, use the method of cadre convergence at all levels, drawing cadres and responsible cadres from the province (region), special district (autonomous prefecture), county, township, and commune levels to form a large-scale inspection and evaluation team. They will go deep into the fields of all townships and communes to work with the peasants to do a good job in autumn field management, and organize evaluation competitions and adopt various measures to eliminate third-class seedlings and fields, and improve second-class seedlings and fields within a specified time limit, to ensure the realization of a comprehensive bumper harvest. The conferences also decided that the inspection and evaluation teams will not leave the fields until a bumper harvest is achieved.

    Cadre convergence at all levels to go deep into the fields, combining with planting experimental fields, and regularly organizing field inspections and visits for evaluation, to lead and promote agricultural production, is a reliable guarantee for the leadership to discover and solve problems in a timely manner and to implement various production increase measures. Hubei Province adopted this method this spring, which played a significant role in achieving a great summer harvest.

    In order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest this autumn, the CPC Central Committee has instructed cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, to frequently go deep into the fields, just like planting experimental fields, so that the leadership and the masses are more closely combined, and the great leap forward in agricultural production is realized. In view of the current urgency of autumn field management, where the above-mentioned methods have not yet been implemented, it is imperative to seize the opportunity, universally organize inspection and evaluation teams, and quickly go deep into the fields.

    (Our report) In order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai and other provinces and regions have organized large-scale inspection and evaluation teams of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people, led by the secretaries of the provincial and regional party committees and participated by cadres at all levels of district (autonomous prefecture), county, township, and commune, and gone deep into the fields to inspect autumn field management. The tasks of the inspection and evaluation teams are: according to the various measures proposed by the provinces and regions to strengthen autumn field management, organize field visits and evaluations, and mobilize the masses to ensure that various measures are implemented. The inspection and evaluation teams generally divide the provincial team into several routes to various special districts, and together with the cadres drawn from the prefectural committee, divide into several groups to various counties, and together with the county, township, and commune cadres drawn by the counties (some also have district-level cadres) divide into several groups to go deep into the fields of various townships and communes for roving inspection and evaluation, until the autumn harvest. If a bumper autumn harvest is not achieved, the inspection and evaluation team will never leave the fields in the area.

    Leading cadres of party and government at all levels participate in the inspection team. If problems are found during the inspection, they can be solved in a timely manner, ensuring that various autumn field management measures such as drought prevention, flood prevention, pest control, top dressing, and mid-cultivation are carried out in a timely manner as required, avoiding delays in autumn field management due to asking for instructions and reporting at each level. The inspection team is a convergence of cadres from all levels and all systems except industry, so that various needs related to striving for a bumper harvest, such as the necessary allocation of fertilizers, pesticides, improved farm implements, flood control and pest control, etc., can be handled in a timely manner. The inspection and evaluation team will organize visits and evaluations to launch a widespread socialist competition of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. All cadres must labor together with the masses and plant experimental fields. The inspection team will also organize and lead the current work of extensively reforming agricultural tools and extensively developing ball bearings.

    Jiangxi Province already has 100,000 cadres who have gone deep into the fields and are leading the work of harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice. Yang Shangkun, the first secretary of the provincial party committee, and Liu Junxiu, the secretary, have both participated. More than 1,200 cadres drawn from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region went to the countryside as early as the 7th of last month, and are now launching a competition throughout the region to strive for a bumper autumn harvest in conjunction with cadres at all levels. According to statistics from only four special districts of Guilin, Yongning, Pingle, and Yishan, more than 620,000 cadres have gone to the countryside. Inspection teams at all levels in Gansu Province have been universally organized, and the inspection work in Zhangye Special District and Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture has been going on for more than a month. Inspection work in Shaanxi Province has also begun universally. After the Hanzhong Prefectural Committee inspection team inspected in Ningqiang County, the work of locally produced fertilizer in Ningqiang County immediately spread. After the inspection of Gaoling County, it greatly promoted autumn field management. The provincial inspection team can also go down in a day or two. The inspection team led by Chen Sigong, secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, and others has also gone deep into the fields.

    Inspection work in Hubei, Guangdong, Ningxia and other provinces and regions is also underway, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is actively preparing.

    抓紧时机组织万人检查团  深入田间认真抓秋田管理
    本报讯　中南各省区和西北各省区都要组织万人检查评比团，实行省、专、县、区、乡、社六级干部会师的办法，深入田间狠狠地抓秋田的管理工作，不实现秋季的全面大丰收，不离开田间。
    中南各省区和西北各省区在7月间先后举行的农业协作会议都作了如下的决定：为了争取秋季更大的丰收，各省区要在有决定意义的今后8、9、10两三个月内，用各级干部会师的办法，抽调省（区）、专区（自治州）、县、乡、社各级干部和负责干部，组成大规模的检查评比团，深入所有乡社的田间，和农民一起搞好秋田管理工作，并组织评比竞赛和采用各种措施，限期消灭三类苗、田和提高二类苗、田，来保证实现全面大丰收。会议还决定，在没有取得大丰收以前，检查评比团决不离开田间。
    各级干部会师深入田间，结合种试验田，经常地组织田间检查和参观评比，来领导和推动农业生产，是领导及时发现和解决问题，实现各项增产措施的可靠的保证。湖北省今年春天采用这个办法，对于取得夏季大丰收起了很大的作用。
    为了争取今秋全面大丰收，中共中央已指示各级干部，特别是领导干部经常地深入田间，和种试验田一样，使领导与群众更紧密地结合，实现农业生产的大跃进。鉴于当前秋田管理十分紧迫，凡是尚未实行上述办法的地方，务必抓紧时机，普遍组织检查评比团，迅速深入田间。
    本报讯　为争取秋季大丰收，江西、广西、甘肃、陕西、青海等省区都已组织了由省、区党委书记领导的，有地（自治州）、县、乡、社各级干部参加的上万人以至十万人的大规模的检查评比团，深入田间检查秋田管理工作。检查评比团的任务是：根据各省区提出加强秋田管理各项措施，组织田间的参观评比，发动群众保证各项措施得到贯彻执行。检查评比团一般是省团分路到各专区，和地委抽调的干部一起分成分团到各县，和各县抽调的县、乡、社（有的还有区级干部）一起分成若干小组，深入各乡社田间作巡回检查评比，一直到秋收。不取得秋季大丰收，检查评比团决不离开所在地区的田间。
    检查团有各级党和政府的领导干部参加，在检查中发现问题就可及时解决，保证防旱、防涝、除虫、追肥、中耕等各项秋田管理措施按要求及时作到，避免由于逐级请示报告耽误了秋田管理工作。检查团是除工业而外的各级各系统的干部的大会师，因而有关争取丰收的各项需要，如必要的调拨肥料、农药、改良农具、防汛治虫等等都能及时处理。检查评比团将以组织参观评比的办法，发动广泛的学先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛。所有干部都要和群众一起劳动，种试验田。检查团还要组织和领导当前大改农具大搞滚珠轴承的工作。
    江西省已经有十万干部深入了田间，正领导抢收早稻和抢插晚稻的工作。省委第一书记杨尚奎和书记刘俊秀都参加了。广西僮族自治区抽调的一千二百多干部早在上月7日就下了乡，现正结合各级干部发动全区的争取秋季大丰收的竞赛。仅据桂林、邕宁、平乐、宜山四个专区统计，下乡干部就达六十二万多人。甘肃省的各级检查团已经普遍组织起来，张掖专区和临夏回族自治州的检查工作已进行了一个多月。陕西省的检查工作也已经普遍开始，汉中地委检查团在宁强县检查后，宁强县土制化肥工作马上就普遍展开了。高陵县检查后对秋田管理推动很大。省的检查团一两天也可下去。青海省由省委书记陈思恭等率领的检查团也已经深入田间了。
    湖北、广东、宁夏等省区的检查工作也正在展开，新疆维吾尔自治区正在积极准备。
