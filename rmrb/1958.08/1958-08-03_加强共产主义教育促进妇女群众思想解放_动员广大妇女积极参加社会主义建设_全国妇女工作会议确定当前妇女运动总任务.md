Xinhua News Agency report: The National Women's Work Conference concluded in Beijing on July 28th. The central topic of this conference was to discuss how, in the current new situation of the nationwide upsurge in socialist construction, women's federations should mobilize and organize women to strive for the implementation of the General Line.

During the conference, Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat, attended and gave instructions.

At the meeting, in the spirit of rectification, the representatives conducted a serious review of the past national women's work, affirmed the tremendous achievements made in women's work under the leadership of the Party, criticized and self-criticized the shortcomings of the All-China Women's Federation and women's federations at all levels in being detached from the masses and reality, and widely exchanged work experiences from various regions. One hundred and eight people made oral and written speeches at the meeting.

The conference held that the general task of current women's work is to mobilize and organize women to strive for the implementation of the General Line. Based on the general task of women's work, the conference held that the specific tasks of current women's work are to actively conduct communist education among the masses of women to promote the ideological liberation of women; actively mobilize and organize women to participate in industrial and agricultural production and other socialist construction undertakings; mobilize women to participate in the technological revolution and cultural revolution, tap the potential abilities of women, and improve women's labor efficiency; organize production in a planned and step-by-step manner, develop collective social service undertakings, better and more fully exert the labor potential of women, and continue to promote diligence and thrift in managing households.

The conference held that strengthening communist ideological education for women and promoting their ideological liberation is an important link in mobilizing the masses of women to correctly implement the General Line. At present, a new situation of great ideological liberation of communism has emerged among women nationwide, and a new atmosphere of mutual assistance, unity, and fraternity of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me" is taking shape; a large number of advanced figures among women who love the Party, love the collective, love socialism, and dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act are emerging. The conference requested women's federations at all levels to pay attention to inspiring women to consciously participate in the practice of class struggle and production struggle when strengthening communist education for women, and to continuously establish proletarian ideology and overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology through the practice of struggle, planting red flags and拔白旗[bá bái qí, "uprooting white flags," removing counter-revolutionary influence]. At the same time, it is necessary to establish the banners of advanced figures among the masses of women, vigorously promote and carry forward their proletarian ideology and excellent qualities, so that the masses of women can more consciously subordinate individual interests to collective and national interests, and make the communist unity, friendship, and sincere cooperation relationship permeate not only among social laborers, but also among family members and neighbors. Furthermore, it is necessary to encourage women to break down their inferiority complex and superstitious ideas, and establish a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to plant red flags among women. When conducting communist education, it is also necessary to constantly educate women on current affairs and policies, so that women can recognize the current domestic and international situation, resolutely oppose the imperialist war policies and aggressive actions, and defend the motherland and world peace with practical actions to accelerate socialist construction.

Representatives reflected in their speeches that since the Great Leap Forward, women across the country have invested in various productions with vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit and have played a great role. The number of rural women participating in production has generally reached about 90% of the female labor force, and in many areas it has reached 100%. A large number of women have participated in the mass campaign to run industry; according to statistics from twenty-one cities, more than 535,000 street women have participated in industrial production. Women in Hebei Province have established more than 282,000 various small factories. The number of women mastering new technologies has also increased unprecedentedly; in Guizhou Province alone, one-third of young and middle-aged women have learned to use new agricultural tools. Women's inventions and innovations are surging. According to a survey in some areas of Henan Province, women have created and reformed more than 1.31 million tools. The conference held that these achievements show that women across the country have played a great role in the high tide of socialist construction, but with the rapid development of socialist construction, all the potential forces of women must be further tapped. Women's federations should more widely mobilize women to participate in industrial and agricultural production and various socialist construction undertakings, participate in the technological revolution and cultural revolution. Mobilize and organize women to actively participate in the campaign for large-scale increases in agricultural production and mass industrialization, organize women to learn technology, generally improve women's technical level and operational proficiency, and encourage women to boldly innovate and create. It is necessary to mobilize women to prepare for the production upsurge in the coming winter and spring, and strive for a greater leap forward. The examples of many advanced women have fully demonstrated that women can do anything, can do anything well, and can do anything well. Therefore, in the process of mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production labor, it is necessary to continue to break down various conservative and backward ideas that despise women, and encourage women to dare to undertake various production labor that requires women's participation. At the same time, it is necessary to encourage women to learn specialized technologies, give full play to their expertise, and strive to learn a variety of technologies to become "all-rounders" on the basis of having certain specialized technologies. While improving women's technical level, it is necessary to eliminate illiteracy among women, and organize women who have become literate to participate in various training classes, cultural and technical schools, Red and Expert schools, etc., to improve women's political level, technical level, and cultural and scientific knowledge.

In order to adapt to the needs of production and promote the development of production, the conference pointed out that women's federations should organize mass life in a planned and step-by-step manner under the unified leadership of the Party committee and on the basis of production development, so as to gradually socialize housework, enable some women who need to participate in social labor to participate in social labor, and enable women who have already participated in social labor to better solve the contradiction between work and housework. The principle of organizing mass life is to follow the voluntary will of the masses, mobilize the masses to run and manage themselves, implement the spirit of mutual benefit and diligence in running all undertakings, adapt to local conditions, be diverse and flexible, and meet the needs of the masses. The conference held that it is still necessary to continue to promote diligence and thrift in building the country and diligence and thrift in managing households. This slogan is correct and can play a positive role regardless of the past, present, and future.

Based on the review of the work of the women's federations in the previous stage, the representatives unanimously agreed that the work style of the women's federations in various places has been greatly improved since the Great Leap Forward, and it has become a common practice to go deep into reality to conduct experimental fields. In order to implement the above tasks, the women's federations in various places must rely more closely on the leadership of the Party, focus on production, face all women, and carry out women's work on the basis of working women. Women cadres are required to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, improve their ideological level, and at the same time go deep into reality and deep into the masses, so as to be both red and expert.

The conference was attended by 240 people in charge of women's federations from provinces, cities, autonomous regions, special districts, and counties.

The conference started on June 30 and lasted for twenty-nine days.

    加强共产主义教育促进妇女群众思想解放
    动员广大妇女积极参加社会主义建设
    全国妇女工作会议确定当前妇女运动总任务
    据新华社讯　全国妇女工作会议7月28日在北京结束。这次会议的中心议题是讨论在当前全国进入社会主义建设高潮的新形势下，妇联组织如何发动和组织妇女为贯彻执行总路线而奋斗。
    会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记李富春到会作了指示。
    会上，代表们本着整风精神，对过去全国妇女工作进行了认真的检查，肯定了妇女工作在党的领导下所获得的巨大成绩，对全国妇联和各级妇联工作中脱离群众脱离实际的缺点进行了批评与自我批评，并且广泛交流了各地的工作经验。在会上作口头和书面发言的有一百零八人。
    会议认为，当前妇女工作的总任务是动员和组织妇女为贯彻执行总路线而奋斗。根据妇女工作的总任务，会议认为，当前妇女工作的具体任务就是要积极向妇女群众进行共产主义教育，促进妇女群众的思想解放；积极地发动和组织妇女参加工农业生产和其他各项社会主义建设事业，动员妇女参加技术革命和文化革命，挖掘妇女的潜在能力，提高妇女的劳动效能；有计划有步骤地组织生产，发展集体的社会服务事业，更好更充分地发挥妇女劳动潜力，并且继续宣传勤俭持家。
    会议认为，对妇女加强共产主义思想教育，促进妇女思想解放，是发动妇女群众正确贯彻执行总路线的重要环节。目前在全国妇女中已经出现了一个共产主义思想大解放的新局面，“我为人人，人人为我”的互助、团结、友爱的新风气正在形成；妇女中爱党、爱集体、爱社会主义和敢想、敢说、敢干的先进人物大量涌现。会议要求各地妇联组织在加强对妇女进行共产主义教育时，注意启发妇女自觉地参加阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，通过斗争实践不断树立无产阶级思想，克服资产阶级思想的影响，插红旗，拔白旗。同时要在妇女群众中树立先进人物的旗帜，大力提倡和发扬她们的无产阶级思想和优秀品质，使妇女群众更自觉地作到个人利益服从集体利益和国家利益，使共产主义的团结友爱真诚协作关系不仅贯串在社会劳动者之间，而且贯串在家庭成员之间和邻里之间。并且进一步鼓舞妇女破除自卑心理和迷信思想，在妇女中树立敢想、敢说、敢干、敢于插红旗的共产主义风格。在进行共产主义教育时，还要注意经常向妇女进行时事政策教育，使妇女认清当前国内外局势，坚决反对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略行为，并以加速社会主义建设的实际行动，保卫祖国、保卫世界和平。
    代表们在发言中反映，从大跃进以来全国妇女以旺盛的革命斗志投入了各项生产，发挥了很大作用。农村妇女参加生产的人数已普遍达到女劳力的90％左右，不少地区达到百分之百。大批妇女参加了全民办工业运动，据二十一个城市统计，已经有五十三万五千多街道妇女参加了工业生产。河北省妇女自办的各种小型工厂已有二十八万二千多个。妇女掌握新技术的人数也空前增多，仅贵州省就有三分之一的青壮年妇女学会了使用新式农具。妇女的发明创造风起云涌。据河南省部分地区的调查，妇女创造和改革的工具就有一百三十一万多件。会议认为，这些成绩说明全国妇女在社会主义建设高潮中已经发挥了很大作用，但是随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展，妇女中的一切潜在力量还必须进一步发掘，妇联组织要更广泛地动员妇女参加工农业生产和各项社会主义建设事业，参加技术革命和文化革命。动员和组织妇女积极参加农业大面积增产和全民办工业的运动，组织妇女学习技术，普遍提高妇女的技术水平和操作的熟练程度，并鼓励妇女大胆革新创造。要动员妇女为今冬明春的生产高潮作好准备，争取更大跃进。众多的先进妇女人物的事例已充分说明了妇女什么都能干，什么都干得会，干得好。为此，在动员和组织妇女参加生产劳动的过程中，还要继续打破各种轻视妇女的保守落后思想，鼓励妇女敢于承担各种需要妇女参加的生产劳动。同时要鼓励妇女学习专门技术，发挥专长，并在有一定专门技术的基础上，争取学习多种技术成为“多面手”。在提高妇女技术水平的同时，要扫除妇女中的文盲，并组织已脱离文盲的妇女参加各种训练班、文化技术学校、红专学校等，提高妇女的政治水平、技术水平和文化科学知识。
    为了适应生产的需要，促进生产发展，会议指出，妇联组织要在党委统一领导下和生产发展的基础上，有计划有步骤地组织群众生活，使家务劳动逐步社会化，使一部分需要参加社会劳动的妇女能够参加社会劳动，使已经参加社会劳动的妇女能够更好地解决工作和家务的矛盾。组织群众生活的原则是根据群众自愿，发动群众自办自管，贯彻互利和勤俭办一切事业的精神，因地制宜、多样灵活、适应群众的需要。会议认为今后还要继续宣传勤俭建国、勤俭持家，这个口号不论过去、现在和将来都是正确的和能够发挥积极作用的。
    代表们根据前一阶段妇联工作的检查，一致认为各地妇联在大跃进以来工作作风有了很大改进，深入实际搞试验田，已成风气。各地妇联组织为了贯彻上述任务，今后要更加紧密地依靠党的领导，以生产为中心，面向全体妇女，以劳动妇女为基础开展妇女工作。要求妇女干部认真学习毛主席的著作，提高思想水平，同时深入实际、深入群众，做到又红又专。
    参加会议的有各省、市、自治区、专区和县妇联负责人共二百四十人。
    会议从6月30日开始，共进行了二十九天。
