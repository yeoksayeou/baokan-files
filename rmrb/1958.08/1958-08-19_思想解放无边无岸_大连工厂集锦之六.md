　　Boundless Ideological Emancipation
　　——A Collection of Dalian Factories, Part Six
　　Zheng Zhong
　　
　　Vastly Different Before and After

　　Before 1955, the Dalian Steel Plant was a backward factory. It failed to meet the state plan every year and was often criticized by superiors, newspapers, and ordering units. The workers' morale was low, and the factory leaders also felt distressed. After more than two years of effort, the situation has begun to change, and most of the important technical and economic indicators had reached the domestic advanced level by the end of 1957. This year, the situation has changed further. This year's Great Leap Forward plan has been revised four times after full discussion by the masses, from a target of 70,000 tons of annual output to a guaranteed 140,000 tons, striving for 160,000 tons. In terms of variety and designs, they proposed to expand to 15,000 types during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

　　The Dalian Steel Plant's Great Leap Forward plan for this year and the Second Five-Year Great Leap Forward plan were unimaginable before February of this year. Why were they unimaginable in the past? The main reasons are as follows: First, coastal areas are not suitable for development; second, the foundation is poor, the equipment is outdated, and the technical strength is weak, unable to adapt to the needs of the new mechanical industry; third, the factory site is surrounded by the sea on two sides, relies on the highway on one side, and is connected to other factories on one side, so natural conditions are limited, and it cannot be developed. These three points became three tight spells on the leaders' heads, believing that the factory had little development prospects, only maintaining the status quo, and there was nothing to do. Since the central government's instructions to break superstitions and emancipate the mind and the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party were conveyed this year, a new situation of ideological emancipation of workers and great development of production has emerged throughout the factory. Many outdated concepts that restricted the development of productive forces have been broken. After a great debate, it was believed that the factory's development prospects were extremely broad, and if the building area was not enough, land could be reclaimed from the sea (now we see them carrying out land reclamation work with overwhelming momentum); if the equipment was outdated, a technical revolution could be launched. Everyone's thinking is lively and vigorous, and everyone is full of energy. After half a year of practice, remarkable achievements have been made, and the following experiences have been summarized. Ideological emancipation is boundless, and the potential of the masses is inexhaustible.

　　The process of in-depth development of the rectification movement is the process of ideological emancipation, and it is also the process of the great leap forward in production. The first Great Leap Forward plan formulated in February this year was in the early stage of the in-depth development of the rectification movement. The total industrial output value was increased by 25% compared with the actual figure of last year, the labor productivity was increased by 19%, and the profits turned over to the state were increased by 20%. At that time, it was considered an advanced plan. After the double-anti and double-comparison movements, it was felt that there was still potential to be tapped, and the first Great Leap Forward plan was revised again. The new Great Leap Forward plan has indicators and measures, and the masses have high confidence, but the leading cadres do not have enough confidence in achieving this plan. After the general line of the Party's socialist construction was conveyed and studied, it immediately produced a huge force among the masses. Everyone believed that the revised Great Leap Forward plan was not only guaranteed but also likely to be exceeded. A new upsurge of technical revolution was set off throughout the factory, and new production records emerged like mushrooms after a rain. The production plan has been revised four times, more than doubling last year's figure.

　　Ideological emancipation and the unleashing of potential abilities will continue to advance with the development of the national situation. Why are the masses and cadres ideologically emancipated and so energetic? To sum up, there are these three reasons: (1) The rectification movement, breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and the Party's general line of socialist construction have taken root in the hearts of the people, which is the driving force for encouraging and promoting progress and daring to think, speak, and act; (2) The promotion of the national Great Leap Forward situation, especially the miracle of agricultural bumper harvests, has greatly moved and encouraged the workers in the industrial sector; (3) The mutual comparison and promotion among brother factories in the industry, and the tight supply of raw materials, have also forced the metallurgical industry to move forward.

　　Now, the leading comrades of this factory realize that ideological emancipation and revolutionary vigor will never remain at the current level and will continue to develop. Their current method of struggle is: to make new contributions to completing this year's Great Leap Forward plan and to prepare for a greater leap forward next year. Look at next year from this year, and lead this year with next year.

　　Look at the Next Step from the Previous Step, and Lead the Previous Step with the Next Step

　　In the situation of the Great Leap Forward, experience has proved that for leaders, it is necessary to constantly put forward new slogans and new goals of struggle according to the demands of the masses, and while completing this year's Great Leap Forward plan, it is necessary to prepare for a greater leap forward next year, to look at the next step from the previous step, to look at next year from this year, and the next step can also drive the previous step, and next year can also drive this year, step by step, promoting each other.

　　The reasons why leading cadres are ideologically emancipated and dare to think, speak, and act are the soaring enthusiasm of the masses inspired by the great rectification movement, the Party's general line of socialist construction, and the national Great Leap Forward situation. The so-called leaders frequently putting forward new slogans and new goals of struggle based on the new situation are put forward on this basis. The four revisions of the Great Leap Forward plan of this factory were produced under the mutual promotion of leaders and the masses. The enthusiasm of the masses promoted the ideological emancipation of the leaders, and the new slogans and new goals of struggle put forward by the leaders also organized and encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses.

　　With the idea of the Great Leap Forward, with new slogans and new goals of struggle, it is necessary to further mobilize the masses and take new measures to turn the plan into practical action. The thoughts of the masses, the indicators of the Great Leap Forward, the measures for realization, and even the final economic effects are all closely linked together. In order to make the highest production level of the previous period become the general level of the next period, there must be a process of mobilizing the masses and organizing the implementation of measures. The work carried out in this process is not only for completing the current task but also for preparing for future work. The serious task of completing this year's Great Leap Forward plan for this factory is in the fourth quarter, and the production volume in the fourth quarter accounts for more than 50% of the annual plan. Therefore, the current work must strive for the new production level in the fourth quarter. When the masses know the goals of struggle for 1959 and the goals of struggle for the Second Five-Year Plan, their enthusiasm will be even more encouraged.

　　Mutual Support, Mutual Promotion, and Overall Leap Forward

　　The Great Leap Forward in production in an enterprise is an organic whole. Within the factory, between workshops, between departments, between workers, between workers and technicians, and between producers and managers, everyone is leaping forward. This leap forward is mutually promoting and mutually driving. In the Great Leap Forward, we must vigorously promote mutual cooperation and mutual support. Any weak link will affect the leap forward of the entire factory. We must establish the overall idea of "I am leaping forward for everyone, and everyone is leaping forward for me."

　　During the several revisions of the Great Leap Forward plan and the implementation of the Great Leap Forward plan in this factory, there have been phenomena of only considering the leap forward of one's own unit and disregarding the leap forward of other units. These phenomena will hinder the leap forward of the entire factory, but they were promptly noticed by the factory leaders and quickly overcome. From the steel plant's experience, the process of overcoming this unhealthy phenomenon is the process of breaking departmentalism and establishing collectivism. If this problem is not solved, it will divert energy, blame each other, and affect each other's work. If this problem is solved in a timely manner, it will promote each other and achieve an overall leap forward. This factory had such a fact that some production workshops, for the sake of their own leap forward, disregarded product varieties, disregarded contract deliveries, and disregarded the next production process. From the perspective of this unit, it seemed that there was a great increase in quantity, but it had a great impact on the overall and the next process. This was the most troublesome thing encountered in the leap forward of this factory, but they all overcame it in a timely manner. In order to complete the annual Great Leap Forward plan, they recently studied the shortage of machine repair forces, technical measures, and the contradictions between daily spare parts and spare parts preparation, as well as large, medium, and small repair tasks. They actively organized large-scale cooperation of the entire factory's machine repair forces, giving full play to the specialties of the machine repair personnel. The tasks of large, medium, and small repairs were contracted by the workshop maintenance forces to each other, so that the personnel of the machinery and power departments could concentrate their energy on manufacturing and improving equipment during this period. The actual effect of doing this is very good.

　　思想解放无边无岸
　　——大连工厂集锦之六
　　郑重
    前后大不相同
    大连钢厂在1955年以前是个落后厂。年年完不成国家计划，经常受到领导上、报纸上和定货单位的批评。工人情绪低落，工厂领导干部也感到苦闷。经过两年多的努力，情况已经开始改变，多数的重要技术经济指标到1957年末已经达到国内的先进水平。今年的情况又有进一步的改变，今年跃进计划经过群众充分的讨论，已经修改过四次，由年产七万吨的指标到保证年产十四万吨，争取十六万吨的指标。在品种和花色上，他们提出要在第二个五年计划期间争取扩大到一万五千种。
    大连钢厂今年的跃进计划和第二个五年跃进的规划，在今年2月份以前是连想都不敢想的。为什么在过去连想都不敢想呢？主要的原因有下列几条：一曰沿海地区不宜发展；二曰基础不好，设备陈旧，技术力量单薄，不能适应新型机械工业的需要；三曰厂址两面环海，一面靠公路，一面和其他工厂相连，自然条件受到限制，不能发展。这三条就成了领导头上的三个紧箍咒，认为这个厂发展前途不大，只有维持现状，没有什么大干头。自从今年中央破除迷信、思想解放的指示和党的八大二次会议的精神传达后，全厂就出现了职工思想大解放，生产大发展的新局面。打破了不少束缚生产力发展的陈旧观念。经过大辩论后，认为工厂发展的前途异常广阔，建筑面积不够可以填海（现在我们看到他们正在以排山倒海之势进行填海工作）；设备陈旧，可以闹技术革命。人人思想生动活泼，个个干劲十足。经过半年来的实践已经有了显著的成绩，并且总结出下述各点经验。思想解放无边无岸，群众的潜力无穷无尽
    整风运动深入发展的过程，就是思想解放的过程，也是生产大跃进的过程。今年2月间制订的第一次跃进计划是整风运动深入发展的初期，工业总产值比去年实际提高25％，劳动生产率提高19％，上交国家利润提高20％，当时认为已经是先进计划了。经过双反、双比运动，感到还有潜力可挖，又重新修订了第一次的跃进计划。新的跃进计划，有指标，有措施，群众信心很高，但领导干部对实现这个计划的信心并不是那么足。党的社会主义建设总路线传达学习以后，立刻在群众中产生了巨大的力量，都认为修订了的跃进计划，不仅有保证而且还可能超过，全厂掀起了大闹技术革命的新高潮，生产新纪录有如雨后春笋，生产计划经过四次修订，比去年翻了一番多。
    思想解放和潜在能力的发挥，将会随着全国形势的发展，不断地前进。为什么群众和干部的思想解放了，干劲这样大呢？概括起来有这三个原因：（1）整风运动，破除迷信、解放思想，和党的社会主义建设总路线深入人心，是鼓舞和推进前进和敢想敢说敢做的动力；（2）全国大跃进形势的推动，特别是农业丰产的奇迹，十分感动和鼓舞了工业部门的职工；（3）在工业上兄弟厂之间的互相评比、促进，原材料的紧张局面也逼迫着冶金工业必须走到前面。
    现在这个厂领导同志认识到思想解放，革命干劲决不会停留在现在这个水平上，一定会继续向前发展。他们现在奋斗的方法是：要为完成今年的跃进计划作出新的贡献，并且为明年更大的跃进做好准备。今年看明年，明年带今年。
      上步看下步，下步带上步
    在大跃进的形势中，经验证明，对于领导者来说，就要根据群众的要求，经常提出新的口号、新的奋斗目标，在完成今年跃进计划的同时，就要为明年更大的跃进做好准备，要上步看下步，今年看明年，而下步也可带动上步，明年也可带动今年，步步相联，互相推动。
    领导干部的思想解放，敢想敢说敢做的原因，是伟大的整风运动、党的社会主义建设总路线和全国大跃进的形势所激发起来的群众的冲天干劲。所谓领导上根据新形势经常提出新的口号、新的奋斗目标，就是在这样的基础上提出来的。这个厂四次跃进计划的修订，就是在领导和群众互相促进的情况下而产生的，群众的干劲，促进了领导思想上的解放，领导上提出的新的口号、新的奋斗目标，也组织和鼓舞着群众的干劲。
    有了大跃进的思想，有了新的口号、新的奋斗目标，就要再进一步发动群众，采取新的措施，变计划为实际行动。群众的思想，跃进的指标，实现的措施，直至最后的经济效果，都是密切联系在一起的。为使前一个时期的最高生产水平成为下一个时期的一般水平，就要有一个发动群众和组织实现措施的过程，这个过程所进行的工作，既是为了完成当前的任务，也是为今后工作做了准备。这个厂完成今年跃进计划的严重任务在第四季度，第四季度生产量占全年计划的50％以上。因此，现在的工作就要为第四季度的新的生产水平而努力，今年第四季度的水平达到了，也就基本上接近明年生产规划要求。当群众知道了1959年的奋斗目标和第二个五年奋斗目标的时候，他们的干劲就更加鼓舞起来了。
    相互支援，相互促进，全面跃进
    企业中的生产大跃进是一个有机的整体。在工厂内部，车间之间，科室之间，工人同工人之间，工人同技术人员之间，生产者和管理者之间，都在跃进，这个跃进是互相促进、互相推动的。在大跃进中要大力提倡互相协作，互相支援。任何一个薄弱环节，都会影响全厂的跃进。要树立“我为人人跃进、人人为我跃进”的整体思想。
    这个厂在几次修订跃进计划和执行跃进计划的时候，都曾发生过只顾自己单位跃进，不顾别的单位跃进的现象。这些现象，是会妨害全厂跃进的，但因工厂领导上及时地注意并且很快地得到克服。从钢厂的经验看来，克服这种不健康现象的过程就是一个破本位主义思想，立集体主义思想的过程。不解决这个问题，就会分散精力，互相扯皮，互相影响工作。这个问题解决的及时，就会互相促进，全面跃进。这个厂有过这样的事实，有些生产车间为了自己的跃进，不顾产品品种，不顾合同交货，不顾下道生产工序，从本单位来看，好像在数量上有很大的提高，但对整体和下道工序有很大影响。这是这个厂跃进中所遇到的最头疼的一件事，但他们都及时地克服了。为了完成全年跃进计划，最近他们又研究了机修力量不足，技术措施，进行日常备件、备品，以及大、中、小修理任务中间的矛盾，积极组织了全厂机修力量的大协作，发挥了机修人员的特长，大、中、小修理的任务由车间检修的力量相互包干，使机械、动力部门的人员在这个期间内，集中精力制造和改进设备，这样做的实际效果很好。
