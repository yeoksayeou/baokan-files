　　U.S. Troops Invade Singapore
　　Earlier this month, the American aggressors, who were carrying out armed intervention in the Middle East, dispatched warships and troops to enter the British-occupied base of Singapore, threatening peace in Southeast Asia.
　　Singapore has long been an economic center used by British colonialists to plunder resources from Southeast Asia and a military base for suppressing national liberation movements in Southeast Asia. In recent years, the United States and Britain have cobbled together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and often holding military exercises to intimidate the Asian people. Singapore is a stronghold for their aggressive activities. In March of this year, the statement issued by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's military advisory conference stated that this military group had decided to use Singapore as an important base. When the United States instigated and supported the military rebellion in Indonesia, Singapore became a central hub for the rebels to travel to and from, as well as a transport station for the imperialists to supply arms to the rebels. The United States also used the pretext of preparing to "evacuate" American expatriates from Sumatra to dispatch warships to Singapore, carrying out military threats against the Indonesian government, with the aim of undermining the Indonesian government's military actions to quell the rebellion and supporting the last-ditch resistance of the rebel government in Sumatra backed by American oil monopolies. As the rebel "government" in West Sumatra reached its end, the U.S. Navy participated in large-scale military exercises from May 1st in the waters from Singapore to the South China Sea.
　　Singapore is a small island at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, with an area of 224 square miles. It originally belonged to Malayan territory. In 1819, Britain occupied Singapore and made it a major commercial port. In 1923, Britain announced the construction of the Singapore naval base, which was completed from 1928 to 1937. Japan occupied Singapore when it launched the Pacific War. After the war, Britain returned and vigorously repaired the Singapore naval base and expanded it. Currently, Britain has a naval base, four air force bases, and an important international airport there. The headquarters of the British Far East Land, Sea, and Air Forces are also located in Singapore.
　　During the Second World War and since then, the Malayan people have launched a national liberation war. Britain adopted a "divide and rule" policy and separated Singapore from Malaya in 1946. On August 31, 1957, Britain was forced to recognize the independence of the Federation of Malaya. In March 1957, when Singapore held negotiations with the British government, it also reached an agreement on the issue of Singapore implementing autonomy within the British Commonwealth. However, not only was the date of autonomy not determined, but Britain also insisted on continuing to occupy the Singapore naval base.
　　Now, the entry of U.S. aggressor troops into Singapore is being carried out in collusion with Britain. This military provocation in Asia has aroused the anger and opposition of the people of Singapore and Asia.

### 美军侵入的新加坡

　　美军侵入的新加坡
    本月初旬，在中近东进行武装干涉的美国侵略者派遣军舰和军队进入英国占据的基地新加坡，威胁东南亚和平。
    新加坡是英国殖民主义者长期来用以掠夺东南亚资源的经济中心和镇压东南亚民族解放运动的军事基地。近年来，美国和英国拼凑东南亚侵略集团，干涉东南亚国家的内政，并常常举行军事演习恫吓亚洲人民，新加坡就是它们进行侵略活动的一个据点。今年3月，东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议发表的声明中，就表示这个军事集团决定把新加坡作为重要的基地。美国在策动和支持印度尼西亚的军事叛乱时，新加坡成了叛乱分子来往的一个中心，也是帝国主义给叛乱分子接济军火的运输站。美国并曾借口准备“撤退”苏门答腊美国侨民，派遣军舰到新加坡，对印度尼西亚政府进行军事威胁，其目的是企图破坏印度尼西亚政府敉平叛乱的军事行动，策应美国在苏门答腊的石油垄断资本所支持的叛乱政府的负隅顽抗。当西苏门答腊的叛乱“政府”到了末日的时候，美国海军参加了从5月1日起在从新加坡到南中国海的海面举行的大规模军事演习。
    新加坡是马来半岛南端的一个小岛，面积二百二十四平方英里。它原属马来亚的领土，1819年英国占领新加坡，并把新加坡作为一个大商港。1923年英国宣布建筑新加坡军港，从1928年到1937年建成。日本发动太平洋战争时占领了新加坡。战后英国卷土重来，大力修复新加坡的军港，并加以扩大。目前，英国在那里拥有一个海军基地，四个空军基地和一个重要的国际机场，英国驻远东陆海空军总司令部也设在新加坡。
    第二次世界大战期间和战后以来，马来亚人民展开了民族解放战争。英国采取“分而治之”的政策，于1946年把新加坡从马来亚分离出来。1957年8月31日，英国被迫承认马来亚联邦独立。1957年3月，新加坡同英国政府进行谈判时，也曾就新加坡在英联邦内实行自治的问题达成了协议，但是，不仅没有确定自治的日期，而且英国还坚持要继续占据新加坡军港。
    现在，美国侵略军进入新加坡，是在同英国勾结下进行的。这种在亚洲的军事挑衅行为，引起了新加坡和亚洲人民的愤怒和反对。
