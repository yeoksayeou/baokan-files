Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 4th: After a day of lobbying in Baghdad, US President's "Special Envoy" Murphy returned to Beirut on the evening of the 3rd.

This well-known American schemer held talks in Baghdad with Iraqi Republic State Guidance Minister Shanshal, Prime Minister Qassem, Foreign Minister Jamal, Finance Minister Muhammad Habib, and Chairman of the Supreme Sovereignty Council Najib al-Ruba'i.

After the talks, Murphy revealed to reporters that he had tried to lure Iraqi national leaders into agreeing to continue participating in the "Baghdad Pact" by using "various Western concepts of security" and fabricated "Soviet threats" and the "idea that no country can fulfill its defense obligations alone."

Murphy had to admit that these leaders of the Iraqi Republic harbored "suspicions about the United States wanting to invade their country, attack them, or interfere in their internal affairs"; Murphy also admitted that they considered the American armed invasion of Lebanon a "mistake," and that the leaders of the Iraqi Republic had stated "they do not want to be ruled by anyone." These Iraqi leaders also "categorically denied that the revolution was directed by external forces" to this imperialist element, who was accustomed to fabricating so-called "indirect aggression," and they explicitly told him that the Iraqi revolution "was purely an internal affair."

Murphy also revealed that while engaging in political wooing, he also attempted to entice them economically. He said that he had specifically "emphasized" to the Iraqis Eisenhower's "attitude" on the issue of "economic cooperation" with underdeveloped countries in the Middle East.

During the talks, they also discussed the issue of the American and British invading forces occupying Lebanon and Jordan. On this issue, Murphy could no longer quibble and had to drag out the dirty fig leaf that the American and British troops were "invited" by the puppet governments of these countries. Murphy said he was also preparing to go to Cairo on the 5th. According to observers in Cairo, Murphy is clearly unwelcome.

    妄想给“巴格达条约”招魂
    墨菲在伊拉克招摇撞骗
    新华社4日讯　巴格达消息：美国总统“特使”墨菲在巴格达进行了一天的游说后又在3日晚回到了贝鲁特。
    这个美国著名的阴谋家在巴格达先后同伊拉克共和国国家指导部长尚沙尔、总理卡塞姆、外交部长贾迈尔、财政部长穆罕默德·哈比卜和最高权力委员会主席纳吉布·鲁巴伊等进行了会谈。
    墨菲在会谈后向记者们透露，他在会谈中曾经用“从西方关于安全的种种观念”和捏造的“苏联的威胁”以及“任何国家都不能单独履行防御义务的观念”这样一些“角度”去诱骗伊拉克的国家领导人同意继续参加“巴格达条约”。
    墨菲不得不承认，这些伊拉克共和国的领导者存有关于美国“要侵犯他们的国家、进攻他们或者干涉他们的内政的种种猜疑”；墨菲还承认，他们认为美国武装侵略黎巴嫩是一个“错误”，而且伊拉克共和国的领导人曾表示“他们不希望受任何人的统治”。这些伊拉克的领袖们还向这个惯于捏造所谓“间接侵略”的帝国主义分子“断然否认革命是受外力指使的”，他们明确地告诉他，伊拉克革命“纯粹是内政”。
    墨菲还透露，他在进行政治拉拢的同时，还从经济方面进行了诱骗。他说，他曾经向伊拉克人特别“强调指出”了艾森豪威尔在同中东不发达国家实行“经济合作”问题上的“态度”。
    他们在会谈中还谈到了美英侵略军侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的问题，在这个问题上墨菲再也无法狡辩，只得重新扯起美英军队是这些国家的傀儡政府“邀请”来的这块肮脏的遮羞布。墨菲说他还准备在5日到开罗去。据开罗的观察家说，墨菲显然是不受欢迎的。
