(Our newspaper's report from Taiyuan on the 13th) Reporter Ma Ming and Zhao Zhongxin report: Constantly organizing high tides of leap forward in newspaper work, extensively carrying out mass newspaper reform movements, thereby combining the high tide within the newspaper office with the high tide of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in society, is causing tremendous changes in the face of Shanxi Daily. Over the past few years, under the direct leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this newspaper has undergone multiple reforms and has become one of the advanced newspaper units in the country. However, it was only after the rectification movement and the continuous organization of high tides of the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work that the newspaper truly adapted to the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation, and significant changes occurred from content to form.

In order to make the newspaper a powerful ideological weapon in the hands of the Party committee, the newspaper's editorial board closely followed the instructions and intentions of the Party committee, and combined them with the new situations that constantly emerged in the Great Leap Forward to organize reporting work. Therefore, this newspaper now almost always has good news, good comments, good headlines, and good reports. Moreover, from the content of the reports to the layout, the striking impression given to readers is: the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward and the characteristics of the great era of "one day equals twenty years" are reflected on the newspaper. Closely linking with reality, grasping the latest things and new problems of each period, and systematically publicizing them in a focused way are the characteristics of this newspaper. For example, while publishing editorials such as "Let Yams and Grain Stand on Equal Footing," "Rehabilitating the Reputation of the Three Treasures" (referring to the promotion of Golden Queen Corn, expanding the area of multiple cropping, and promoting Xinjiang cotton planting experience), "Refuting Tension Theory," "Settling Accounts with the 'Autumn Reckoning Faction' in Advance," and "Promoting Autumn with Summer, Advancing Vigorously on the Victory," there were news, articles, reports, and pictures to form a prominent layout. This reporting method has greatly promoted practical work. As some readers said: this newspaper not only timely reflects the reality of the Great Leap Forward, but also can stand in front of the Great Leap Forward situation, fuel the waves, and play the role of the Party newspaper as a promoter of the Great Leap Forward.

Combining Internal Leap Forward and External Leap Forward

The reason why Shanxi Daily can be a promoter of the Great Leap Forward is that under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, they have carried out a series of major reforms in newspaper work. The first is that the leading members of the editorial board emancipated their minds, opposed conservatism, and closely combined reporting on the Great Leap Forward movement with carrying out the Great Leap Forward in the work of the newspaper office. And making the internal political and ideological work of the office, mobilizing the positive factors of all staff members, as the primary task of leadership. In order to make all staff members put politics in command and implement the principle of "using the abstract to lead the concrete," the leaders of the newspaper often encouraged all staff members to be good at learning from the working people, good at learning from the communist style of daring to think and daring to do that the workers and peasants showed in the Great Leap Forward; to draw infinite wisdom and strength from it to improve themselves and transform their subjective world. In March of this year, in order to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced in the Great Leap Forward, this newspaper issued a proposal to provincial newspapers across the country to carry out socialist friendship competition, and put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard for three months to greatly change the face of the newspaper; fighting hard for one year to catch up with the most advanced level of provincial newspapers." However, in the initial stage of carrying out the Great Leap Forward movement in newspaper work, it encountered resistance from conservative ideas from two aspects. One is that some units and individuals hold a wait-and-see attitude towards the Great Leap Forward, lack drive, lack confidence in competing with brother provincial newspapers, and even some people are listless and engage in individualism. One is that they are superstitious about the fact that mass movements cannot be carried out in newspaper work itself. They are content with the status quo, emphasizing the so-called "special nature" of "news work is individual labor," denying that ideological awareness, work enthusiasm, and the quantity and quality of work can all be compared.

After analyzing this situation, the editorial board and the General Branch of the Communist Party of Shanxi Daily proposed to all members of the editorial department: if the newspaper is to reflect and promote the comprehensive Great Leap Forward and be a promoter of the Great Leap Forward, the editorial department must carry out the movement of the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work and constantly improve the ideological awareness and work enthusiasm of the staff. If the thoughts and feelings of the editors cannot beat with the pulse of the Great Leap Forward era, they cannot reflect the spirit of the era in the reports. In order to completely solve this problem, the editorial board has organized three high tides of the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work from March to now. The first high tide (March) focused on solving the problem of indicators, the second high tide (May) focused on solving the problem of measures, and the third high tide (July) focused on solving the problem of quality. The formation of each high tide is after fully mobilizing the masses, according to the work tasks of each period and the existing problems in ideology, putting forward specific and clear slogans, indicators, and measures. In each high tide, the editorial board implemented putting politics in command, grasped ideological and political work, mobilized all positive factors of the staff, and overcame all negative factors. There are three ways to do this: First, face the objectively existing contradictions between advanced and backward, and after investigating the ideological situation and sorting out the ranks, use the method of praising the advanced and criticizing the backward to promote the transformation of the backward to the advanced. All professional departments of the editorial department have generally used the method of publishing wall newspapers in carrying out mass criticism and praise. Like big-character posters, everyone runs it, everyone reads it, and the criticism and praise are specific and powerful. Second, advocate learning and doing what is reported, so that internal work and reporting work can leap forward together and promote each other. For example, socialist collaboration and the development of "multi-skilled" movements in industrial and agricultural production and construction have been widely carried out in all professional departments of the editorial department. This not only overcomes the imbalance of internal work and improves work efficiency and professional level, but also further educates the editors directly in the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Third, constantly educate all staff members with model figures and advanced deeds that have emerged in the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and in this agency. When the editorial board found that the cooks in the canteen used yams instead of grain to make more than 100 kinds of delicious foods, they seized this advanced deed and carried out prominent praise in a big way, and mobilized the editors to congratulate them. Vigorously publicize the results of the cooks in the canteen putting politics in command - the advanced thinking of saving a large amount of grain for the country and ensuring that everyone is fed well, and call on all staff members of the newspaper to learn from their tireless, hard-working, daring to break the rules, and bold creative work spirit. It particularly emphasized that the editors should learn their method of making fine food from coarse grains: an ordinary yam can make such a wide range of staple and non-staple foods, why can't we make the newspaper more lively, rich, and colorful with so many contributions and letters? The model deeds of the canteen greatly encouraged and educated everyone, and the atmosphere of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced became stronger. After three high tides of the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work, those who originally thought that mass movements could not be carried out in newspaper work also regarded continuous leap forward as the revolutionary norm of the current rapidly changing era.

Everyone Should Be a "Multi-Skilled Person"

Shanxi Daily applied the experience of rectification and the advanced experience of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture to organizing the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work, and as a result, it found new working methods for running the newspaper well. The widespread adoption of these working methods is extremely conducive to reflecting and promoting the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction. The situation is this: With the continuous emergence of high tides in industrial and agricultural production, new situations and new problems are occurring every moment, and newspapers need to take various forms to report, comment, and guide practical movements quickly and accurately. However, due to the reduction of personnel in the newspaper office after streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to lower levels, and the fact that the existing editors have exerted a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity after the leap forward formed a high tide, breaking through the original set of order and working methods. Therefore, for a time, there was a lot of drive and a lot of "chaos"; and there was a situation of insufficient reflection of the situation of the Great Leap Forward. In order to solve this problem, each professional department used wall newspapers to carry out great debates, mobilize everyone to emancipate their minds, offer suggestions and strategies, and formulate measures to ensure the leap forward. The slogan put forward by the economic department was: Everyone summarizes one thing, and everyone contributes five strategies. On the basis of everyone's suggestions, ten working methods were summarized. Among them are "everyone must be abstract, using the abstract to lead the concrete," "everyone should be a 'multi-skilled person,' and gradually realize 'three comprehensions,'" and "everyone should come up with topics, and everyone should write comments" ("multi-skilled person" means that one person should learn editing, interviewing, and be able to do mass work; "three comprehensions" refers to being familiar with industry, agriculture, and finance). The fact that these experiences of rectification and the advanced experiences of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture have been applied to the newspaper editorial department has proven that the effect is very good. At present, the big-character posters of the editorial department have become regularized, and each department has its own forum for airing views (wall newspaper). After the economic department and the political department launched the movement of "everyone should be a multi-skilled person," most people have learned photography, and there have been excellent "products" published in the newspaper. The pictures taken by the reporters and editors of the economic department account for 30% of the total number of economic pictures. This year, some editorials or comments written by industrial and rural reporters have appeared in the newspaper. The phenomenon of reporters being too specialized in their work is also changing. The editorial department has also newly produced a group of experts who are good at writing small columns, and Lei Jianren is one of them. He was originally a clerk in the economic department and did not undertake editing tasks. In the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work, he saw that the newspaper lacked small columns, small lenses, and the like, and everyone was grasping new major problems. In addition to completing his own full-time work, he carefully selected a batch of manuscripts from contributions and letters that were difficult to publish prominently, and compiled them into small columns that were welcomed by readers, such as "Rabbit Raising," "Fish Farming," and "Silkworm Raising." In the small column "Silkworm Raising," he specifically introduced the methods of developing silkworm raising with more, faster, better, and more economical results. In order to solve the difficulty of lacking photos when the fish farming column was published, he entrusted a comrade in the art group to ask someone to draw a Chinese painting instead, so that a beautiful Chinese painting appeared on the economic page for the first time. He also designed a set of soil instruments for calculating word counts and arranging layouts, and some editors also asked him to be an "advisor" when arranging layouts. Everyone being a "multi-skilled person" not only solves the contradiction between heavy reporting tasks and fewer editors, but also can quickly improve the professional level of reporters and editors.

Everyone comes up with topics, and everyone writes comments, so that the difficult problem of lacking a team to write editorials is solved. Of the 25 people in the economic department, 16 have started to write editorials, and 6 of them started writing this year. From January to July 23, 94% of the 159 editorials published in the economic field were written by the economic department itself. The comrades who started writing editorials had mysterious views and a sense of inferiority about editorials. Now, most of them have gone from not daring to write to daring to write, from leaders coming up with topics to actively coming up with topics themselves, from leaders helping to study what to write and how to write, to actively putting forward outlines for writing, forming a style of everyone coming up with topics and everyone writing editorials. Therefore, according to the number of editorials allocated by the editorial board to the economic department this year (20 per month), it is no longer a problem of not being able to complete it, but a problem of how to balance and control it.

The Unity of Content and Form Reflects the Great Era

How to make the form of the newspaper, like the content of the newspaper, set off the strong atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward and reflect the characteristics of our great era is an important content of the newspaper innovation carried out by Shanxi Daily in the Great Leap Forward. In this regard, they have also gained important experience and gains. In continuous practice and debate, they have come to the conclusion that content and form must be unified. Specifically, in terms of layout processing: realism must be combined with romanticism; large, medium, and small must be combined; and it must be gradually poetic and beautified. This has become the guiding ideology for all staff members of the editorial department in handling the relationship between content and form. Before the Great Leap Forward, the relationship between the form of the newspaper and the content of the newspaper was a long-standing and endless debate in the editorial department of this newspaper. In the past, the opinion that form was insignificant often prevailed, so the innovation of the form of the newspaper often lagged behind the improvement of the reporting content. This weak link was broken in the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work. The most prominent is the report on the high yield of summer wheat this summer. Starting in mid-June, Shanxi Daily continuously made concentrated and prominent reports on the summer harvest on the front page of four issues on the 11th, 14th, 16th, and 24th. During this period, the new record of high wheat yield was higher than the last, and the emotions of the editors were greatly stimulated and encouraged, which made the editorial department realize the unity of content and form, the form originates from the content, serves the content, and the content is expressed in the form, and the characteristics and atmosphere of the boiling great era should be vividly reflected from the reporting form. On June 16, after the editorial department heard that Hejin County had successively appeared five new records of high wheat yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu, they repeatedly studied from the content: this is the great victory of the general line, the brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and the concentrated expression of the power and wisdom of the people with communist style. At that time, this was also the highest in the province and the most miracles in the scope of a county. How to express the significance of these aspects in the form, layout, and headlines at the same time? After research, several schemes were put forward, and finally one of them was selected. The full text of the news in Hejin County was less than 1,000 words, but it used half a page that could hold 5,000 words. In terms of form, a large red flag was used as the background, and the news of Hejin was published on it. This treatment was to show the spirit that fits such a thing. That night, Xinhua News Agency successively sent five new records of high wheat yield of 3,000 jin to 5,000 jin from fraternal provinces, and immediately wrote an editorial "How much grain can one mu of land produce?" In the layout of the entire page, in addition to the prominent treatment of "Hejin Five Wheat Kings" in this province, the news of the new records of high wheat yield in fraternal provinces was published with the headline "There is heaven beyond heaven," which not only expressed the facts of the news, but also opened up readers' thinking and easily aroused readers' associations.

Continuous Revolution and Continuous Leap Forward

In short, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, Shanxi Daily constantly put forward new tasks and organized new high tides with the spirit of continuous revolution. In accordance with the principle that educators should be educated first, it constantly carries out political and ideological work, and often uses the advanced figures, advanced thinking, and advanced working methods that have emerged in the Great Leap Forward to educate the staff of this agency. And every time a new task is put forward and a new high tide is organized, a great debate is conducted to make the cadres' political enthusiasm and work enthusiasm always full and abundant, and their ideological understanding catches up with the rapidly changing situation. Under the slogan of "everyone is an editor-in-chief, and everyone is a department director," the working methods of the Party's mass line are implemented in all work, and the wisdom of the masses is fully utilized. In this way, the internal leap forward and the external leap forward, solving the thinking of editors and solving the thinking of the masses are closely combined with a high degree of concentration and a high degree of democracy, which makes the entire newspaper office always present a vigorous atmosphere of leap forward.

Although Shanxi Daily has achieved remarkable results in the Great Leap Forward, there are still some shortcomings. For example, some major issues and new things have not been fully reflected in the newspaper, or they have not been grasped deeply, thoroughly, or in a timely manner, and the quality of some comments, articles, and news is not high enough. The problem of leading cadres going to factories and rural areas and the problem of mass work need to be further resolved, and the leadership of the editorial board and internal working methods also need to be further improved.

They always believe that the current situation of the newspaper is still far from the requirements of the Party and the requirements of the objective situation. Therefore, on the one hand, they sent a visiting group to study the advanced experience of eight fraternal newspapers, and on the other hand, they adopted a method combining bottom-up and top-down to carry out mass inspection, summary, and evaluation work, and combined with the fourth stage of rectification to carry out in-depth ideological mobilization inside and outside the Party, brewing and organizing the fourth high tide of the Great Leap Forward in newspaper work.

    充分反映大时代　热情歌颂大跃进
　　山西日报干劲大进步快
　　报社不断掀起跃进高潮　报纸内容形式出现巨大变化
    本报太原13日电　记者马明、赵忠信报道：不断地组织报纸工作的跃进高潮，广泛开展群众性的报纸改革运动，从而把报社内部的高潮和社会上全面大跃进的高潮相结合，正在使山西日报的面貌发生着巨大的改变。几年来，这个报纸在中共山西省委直接领导下，经过多次的改革，已成为全国先进报纸单位中的一个。但是，报纸真正能够适应大跃进形势的需要，从内容到形式都发生显著的变化，却是经过整风运动和不断组织报纸工作大跃进高潮以后出现的。
    为了使报纸真正成为党委手中的强有力的思想武器，报社编委会紧紧依据党委的指示和意图，并结合大跃进中不断出现的新情况，来组织报道工作。因此，这个报纸现在几乎经常有好新闻、好评论、好标题和好通讯出现。并且，从报道内容到版面形式，给读者的突出印象是：把大跃进的气息和一天等于二十年的伟大时代的特色，反映到报面上来了。密切联系实际、抓住各个时期最新的事物和新问题，集中系统地加以宣传，是这个报纸的特点。比如在发表“让山药蛋和粮食平起平坐”、“为三宝
  （指推广金皇后玉米、扩大复播面积、推广新疆植棉经验）恢复名誉”、“驳紧张论”、“和‘秋后算账派’提前算账”、“以夏促秋，乘胜猛进”等社论的同时，都有新闻、文章、通讯、图片，组成一个突出的版面。这种报道方法对实际工作的推动作用很大。正如有些读者所说的：这个报纸不仅及时反映了大跃进的实际，而且能够站在大跃进形势的前面，推波助澜，发挥了党报当好大跃进促进派的作用。
    内部跃进和外部跃进相结合
    山西日报所以能够当好大跃进的促进派，是由于在大跃进的形势下，他们在报纸工作上进行了一系列的重大改革。首先是编委会领导成员解放思想，反对保守，把报道好大跃进运动与开展报纸机关工作的大跃进紧密结合起来。并把做好机关内部的政治思想工作，调动全社工作人员的积极因素，做为领导的首要任务。为了使全社工作人员做到人人政治挂帅，贯彻“以虚带实”的原则，报社的领导经常鼓励全社人员，要善于向劳动人民学习，善于向大跃进中工农群众所表现的那种敢想、敢干的共产主义风格学习；从中吸取无穷的智慧和力量，来提高自己，改造自己的主观世界。在今年3月间，这个报纸为了在大跃进中学先进、赶先进，曾向全国省报发出了开展社会主义友谊竞赛的倡议，并且提出了“苦战三月，报纸面貌大改变；苦战一年，赶上省报最先进水平”的口号。但是，在开展报纸工作大跃进运动的初期，却遇到了来自两个方面的保守思想的阻力。一个是有些单位和个人对大跃进持观望态度，干劲不足，对和兄弟省报竞赛缺乏信心，甚至有的人暮气缠身闹个人主义。一个是迷信报纸工作本身不能搞群众运动，他们安于现状，强调所谓“新闻工作是个体劳动”的“特殊性”，否认思想觉悟、劳动热情和工作数量与质量都是可以比较的。
    编委会和中共山西日报党总支部分析了这种情况以后，向编辑部全体人员提出：报纸要反映、推动全面大跃进，当好大跃进的促进派，编辑部就必须开展报纸工作大跃进的运动，不断提高工作人员的思想觉悟和工作热情。如果编辑人员的思想感情不能随着大跃进时代脉搏跳动而跳动，就不能在报道中体现时代的精神。为了彻底解决这个问题，编委会从今年3月到现在已经组织了三次报纸工作大跃进的高潮。第一次高潮（三月份）着重解决指标问题，第二次高潮（五月份）着重解决措施问题，第三次高潮（七月份）着重解决质量问题。每次高潮的形成，都是经过充分地发动群众，根据各个时期的工作任务、思想上存在的问题，提出具体明确的口号、指标、措施。编委会在每次高潮中实行政治挂帅，抓思想政治工作，调动工作人员的一切积极因素，克服一切消极因素。这有三种办法：一、正视客观存在的先进和落后的矛盾，在调查思想状况、摸底排队以后，运用表扬先进、批评落后的方法，促使落后向先进转化。编辑部各个专业部在开展群众性的批评和表扬上，普遍运用了出墙报的办法。和大字报一样大家办、大家看，批评、表扬具体有力。二、提倡报道什么就学什么、做什么，使内部工作和报道工作一齐跃进，互相促进。比如工农业生产建设中的社会主义大协作和开展“多面手”运动，都已经在编辑部的各个专业部广泛开展，这样不仅克服了内部工作的不平衡状况，提高了工作效率和业务水平，而且使编辑人员进一步受到了工农业大跃进的直接教育。三、不断以工农业和本机关大跃进中出现的模范人物和先进事例教育全体人员。编委会发现食堂炊事员利用山药蛋代替粮食制作了一百多种味美可口的食品，便抓住这件先进事例，大张旗鼓地进行突出的表扬，发动编辑人员向他们贺喜。大力宣传食堂炊事员政治挂帅的结果——既为国家节约了大批粮食，又保证大家吃饱吃好的先进思想，并且号召全报社工作人员学习他们不知疲倦、刻苦钻研、敢于破格和大胆创造的工作精神。特别强调编辑人员要学习他们粗粮细作的方法：一个普通的山药蛋可以做出那样琳琅满目的主副食品，我们有那么多来稿来信，为什么不能把报纸编得更加生动活泼、丰富多彩呢？食堂的模范事迹使所有的人受到极大的鼓舞和教育，学先进、赶先进的跃进气氛更浓厚了。经过三次报纸工作大跃进的高潮，原来认为报纸工作不能搞群众运动的人，也把不断跃进看成是当前瞬息万变的时代的革命常规了。
        人人要当“多面手”
    山西日报把整风的经验和工农业大跃进中先进的经验运用于组织报纸工作大跃进，结果摸索到了办好报纸的新的工作方法。这些工作方法的广泛采用，极有利于反映和促进工农业生产建设的大跃进。情况是这样的：随着工农业生产高潮的不断出现，每时每刻都在发生新情况、新问题，需要报纸采取各种形式迅速、准确地加以报道、评论，指导实际运动。但是由于报社在精简机构和干部下放以后，人员减少，现有编辑人员又在跃进形成高潮以后发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，冲破了原来的一套秩序和工作方法。因此一度造成了干劲很大、“乱劲”也很大；而对大跃进的形势则有反映不足的情况。为了解决这个问题，各专业部运用墙报开展大鸣、大放、大辩论，发动大家解放思想，献计献策，制订保证跃进的措施。经济部提出的口号是：人人总结一件事，个个献出五条计。在大家献计的基础上，归纳了工作方法十条。其中有“人人务虚，以虚带实”、“人人要当‘多面手’，逐步实现‘三通’”、“人人出题目，人人写评论”等（“多面手”是一个人要学会编辑、采访，会做群众工作；
  “三通”是指通工业、农业和财经）。把这些整风的经验和工农业大跃进的先进经验运用到报纸编辑部后，事实证明效果很好。目前，编辑部的大字报已经常化，每个部都有自己的鸣放园地（墙报）。经济部和政治部开展“人人要当多面手”运动以后，绝大部分人都学会摄影，并且已经有优秀的“产品”见报。经济部采编人员拍摄的图片，占到经济图片总数的30％。今年报面上出现了一些工业、农村记者写的社论或评论。记者分工过细的现象也正在改变着。编辑部还新生了一批善于编写小专栏的能手，雷健人便是其中的一个。他本来是经济部的干事，并不担负编辑任务。在报纸工作大跃进中，他看到报面上缺少小专栏、小镜头之类的东西，而大家又都在抓新的大问题。他除完成自己的专职工作以外，又从来稿、来信中精心地挑选出一批向来难得突出发表的稿件，编写成读者欢迎的“养兔”、“养鱼”、
  “养蚕”等小专栏。他在编写“养蚕”的小专栏里，专门介绍了多、快、好、省发展养蚕事业的办法。为了解决养鱼小专栏发表时缺乏照片的困难，他就委托美术组的同志请人画了一张国画代替，使经济版上别开生面首次出现美丽的国画。他还设计了一套计算字数、安排版面的土仪器，有些编辑安排版面也来请他当“顾问”。人人都当“多面手”，不仅解决了报道任务繁重、采编人员少的矛盾，而且可以迅速提高采编人员的业务水平。
    人人出题目，人人写评论，使缺乏撰写社论的队伍的难题得到解决。经济部二十五人中，动手写社论的有十六人，其中六人是今年开始学写的。从1月到7月23日，在经济方面登载的一百五十九篇社论中，94％是经济部门自己撰写的。开始学写社论的同志，对社论有神秘观点和自卑感，现在，大部分已经从不敢写到敢写，从领导出题到自己主动出题目，从领导帮助研究写什么、怎样写，到自己主动提出撰写提纲，形成了人人出题目，人人写社论的风气。因此，根据编委会今年给经济部分配的社论数量（每月二十篇），已经不是完不成的问题，而是如何平衡和控制的问题了。
  内容形式统一反映伟大时代
    如何使报纸的形式和报纸的内容一样，烘托出大跃进的浓郁气息，反映出我们伟大时代的特色，这是山西日报在大跃进中进行报纸革新的一项重要内容。这方面，他们也已经取得重要经验和收获。他们在不断的实践与辩论中，得出了内容与形式必须统一的结论。具体地说在版面处理上：现实主义要与浪漫主义相结合；大中小要相结合；并要逐步诗化、美化。这已成为全编辑部工作人员在处理内容与形式关系上的指导思想。在大跃进以前，报纸形式和报纸内容的关系，是这个报纸的编辑部长期争论不休的问题。过去争论常常是形式无足轻重的意见占上风，因而报纸形式的革新，常常落在报道内容改进的后面。这个薄弱环节，在报纸工作大跃进中被突破了。最突出的是在今年夏季小麦高额丰产的报道上，从6月中旬开始，山西日报连续在11、14、16、24日共四期的第一版上，对夏收作了集中突出的报道。这一期间，小麦高额丰产的新纪录一次比一次高，编辑人员的感情受到极大的激发和鼓舞，从而使编辑部人员认识到内容和形式的统一，形式产生于内容，为内容服务，而内容以形式为表现，应该从报道形式上把沸腾着的伟大时代的特色和气息，生动地反映出来。6月16日，编辑部人员听到河津县连续出现了五个亩产两千斤以上的小麦高额丰产新纪录以后，他们反复从内容上研究：这是总路线的伟大胜利，也是大跃进的辉煌成果，更是具有共产主义风格的人民的力量和智慧的集中表现，当时这又是全省最高和在一个县的范围内出现最多的奇迹。怎样在形式上、版面上、标题上同时表现这几个方面的意义？经过研究，提出了几个方案，最后选择了其中的一个。河津县的消息全文不到一千字，却用了可容五千字的半个版面。形式上用了一面大红旗作底，上面登着河津的消息，这样处理是为了表现合乎这样事情的气魄。当天夜晚又收到新华社连续发出的五条三千斤到五千斤的兄弟省小麦高额丰产新纪录的消息，马上写了一篇“一亩地究竟能打多少粮？”的社论。在整个版面的安排上，除了本省的“河津五麦王”作了突出的处理以外，又以“天外有天”的标题，刊登了兄弟省小麦高额丰产新纪录的消息，这样既表达了新闻的事实，又开拓了读者的思路，易引起读者的联想。
        不断革命不断跃进
    总之，山西日报在大跃进的形势下，以不断革命的精神，不断地提出新的任务，组织新的高潮。按照教育者首先受教育的原则，不断地进行政治思想工作，经常用大跃进中出现的先进人物先进思想先进工作方法，来教育本机关工作人员。并在每次提出新任务组织新高潮时，都要进行大鸣大放大辩论，使干部的政治热情与工作积极性经常饱满充沛，思想认识赶上瞬息万变的形势。在“人人当总编辑、人人当部主任”的口号下，在各种工作中贯彻执行了党的群众路线的工作方法，充分发挥群众的智慧。这样就把内部的跃进和外部的跃进，解决编辑人员思想和解决群众思想，高度的集中和高度的民主紧密地结合起来，就使全报社一直呈现一种蓬蓬勃勃的跃进气氛。
    山西日报虽然在大跃进中取得了显著成绩，但也还存在着一些缺点。例如，有些重大问题和新事物还没有在报纸上得到充分的反映，或者抓得不深、不透、不及时，有些评论、文章、新闻质量还不够高，领导干部下厂下乡问题，群众工作问题还需要进一步解决，编委会的领导和内部工作方法也需要进一步改进。
    他们始终认为，报纸的现状，距离党的要求和客观形势的要求尚远。因此，他们一面派遣参观访问组外出学习了八个兄弟报纸的先进经验，一面采取自下而上和自上而下相结合的办法，开展群众性的检查总结和评比工作，并结合整风第四阶段在党内外进行深入的思想发动，酝酿和组织第四次报纸工作跃进高潮。
