　　Patient's Good News

　　Painless Surgery
    Recently, all surgical medical staff of Shanghai Renji Hospital have implemented "painless surgery," ensuring that patients experience no pain before or after surgery, during drainage, dressing changes, suture removal, injections, or wound care.
    When implementing painless surgery, the medical staff first put politics in command. In addition to greening and perfuming the wards and improving the ward environment to divert patients' attention from their illnesses, they also thoroughly improved their service attitude, treating patients as family members. The day before surgery, ward doctors and nurses explain the details of the surgery to patients to dispel their concerns about the operation.
    The hospital's medical staff, through testing on their own skin, mastered painless injection techniques within two days. For intravenous injections, they adopted methods such as local anesthetic cold compresses and pressure ligation to avoid pain. In terms of surgical pain relief, they used intravenous drip infusions of 0.25% anesthetic "Nupercaine," which eliminated pain in cases such as gastrectomy, lower limb varicose vein stripping, and appendectomy. During surgery, they fully utilized auxiliary anesthesia, using headphones to play music for patients undergoing local and spinal anesthesia to divert their attention and eliminate fear. For wound care, they have adopted open treatment methods to accelerate healing and eliminate the pain caused by blood clots on gauze irritating the wound.

　　无痛外科
    上海市仁济医院全体外科医护人员，最近实施了“无痛外科”，使病人手术前后、引流、换药、拆线、注射、伤口都能不发生疼痛。
    实施无痛外科时，医护人员首先政治挂帅，除了在病房进行绿化、香化、改善病房环境，分散病人对他们所患疾病的注意力外，又彻底改善服务态度，做到对病人亲如家人。在手术前一天，病房医师、护士先向病人解释手术的情形，消除病人对施行手术的顾虑。
    医院医护人员在注射方面通过自己皮肤的试验，在两天内全部掌握了无痛注射。在静脉注射方面，他们采用局部麻醉冷敷、压迫结扎等方法避免疼痛。手术止痛方面，他们采用了静脉滴注0.25％麻醉药“奴弗卡因”的方法，在胃切除术、下肢静脉曲张剥离术、阑尾切除术等病例中都没有发生疼痛现象。在手术过程中充分利用辅助麻醉，对局部和脊椎麻醉者用耳机收听音乐，分散病人的注意力和消除恐惧心理。对于伤口处理，已经采用暴露疗法，加速愈合，并消除病人因纱布凝血对伤口刺激所产生的痛苦。
