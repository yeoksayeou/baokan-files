    This newspaper, Soviet Kuibyshev Oblast, Zhiguli, 10th dispatch: The world's largest hydroelectric power station – the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station – has officially been completed, with all its decoration and miscellaneous work finally finished. A grand inauguration ceremony was held here today.
    Today, the magnificent hydroelectric power station buildings and spillway dams were beautifully decorated. At 4:00 PM, a grand inauguration ceremony was held in the square near the power station. Representatives from all walks of life from across the Soviet Union and the builders of the hydroelectric station joyfully welcomed the Soviet Party and government leaders who came from Moscow to attend the grand ceremony: Aristov, Brezhnev, Suslov, Khrushchev, and Polyansky. Khrushchev spoke at the ceremony and, on behalf of the government, announced that the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station would be named the Lenin Hydroelectric Station.
    The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station was built according to a 1950 resolution of the Soviet government. It is one of the comprehensive water conservancy projects for the comprehensive utilization of the Volga River. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station has a power generation capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, exceeding the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States, which has a maximum power generation capacity of 1.974 million kilowatts, making it the largest hydroelectric station already built in the world. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station generates 11 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which is four times more than the total annual electricity generation of Tsarist Russia. The completion of this hydroelectric station is a new victory for the great communist construction of the Soviet Union and opens a new page in the history of world science and practice.
    The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is the crystallization of the highly developed science and technology of the Soviet Union. Scientists and workers worked closely together, boldly innovating and breaking the "arguments" of Western capitalist scholars that large-scale hydroelectric power stations could not be built on clay and sandy foundations. The giant hydroelectric power station building of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is built on a clay foundation.
    The construction speed and scale of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station are unprecedented in the world. Its production costs are also very low. According to experts, the entire construction cost of the hydroelectric station can be recovered from the electricity produced by the hydroelectric power within six years. Since power generation began at the end of 1955, 20% of the construction cost has already been recovered.
    The highly technical equipment and perfect organization of the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station were particularly prominent when the Volga River bed was blocked in the autumn of 1955. Although the river flow was about 4,000 cubic meters per second at the time of closure, it took only 19 hours to subdue the torrent of the turbulent European river, the Volga. In contrast, the United States spent 1,140 hours to block the Columbia River bed when building the McNary Dam (although the flow of this river is much smaller than that of the Volga).
    The 20 Kaplan turbines installed in the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station also have an unprecedented power generation capacity in the world. Each turbine weighs 3,200 tons, is taller than a ten-story building, and has a working wheel diameter of more than nine meters. Its first turbine began operating at the end of 1955, and all 20 turbines were put into production by October 1957. So far, there has never been such a rapid pace in the world's hydraulic engineering construction.
    Soviet scientists are designing a plan to divert part of the water from the northern rivers such as the Pechora and Vychegda into the Volga River. After this plan is implemented, the water volume of the Volga River will be greatly increased. At that time, the power generation capacity of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will increase from 2.1 million kilowatts to 3 million kilowatts. (Attached picture)

    苏联又在世界科学和实践的历史上揭开一新页
　　世界最大的古比雪夫水电站最后落成
　　赫鲁晓夫在落成典礼上讲话并命名为列宁水电站
    本报苏联古比雪夫州日古里10日电　世界上最大的水力发电站——古比雪夫水电站正式落成了，它的一切装饰工作和零星工作都已最后完毕。今天在这里举行了隆重的落成典礼。
    今天，雄伟的水电站厂房、溢水坝都打扮得十分漂亮。下午四时，在水电站附近的广场上举行了盛大的落成典礼。来自全苏各地的各界代表和水电站建设者，一起欢欣鼓舞地迎接了从莫斯科来参加盛典的苏联党政领导人：阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、波利扬斯基。赫鲁晓夫在典礼上讲了话，并代表政府宣布把古比雪夫水电站命名为列宁水电站。
    古比雪夫水电站是根据1950年苏联政府的决议建造的，它是全面综合利用伏尔加河的水利枢纽工程之一。古比雪夫水电站的发电能力为二百一十万瓩，超过了美国最大的发电能力达一百九十七万四千瓩的大库利水电站，成为世界上已建成的水电站中最大的一个。古比雪夫水电站每年的发电量为一百一十亿度，即比沙皇俄国每年总发电量还多四倍。这座水电站的建成是苏联伟大共产主义建设的一项新胜利，并在世界的科学和实践的历史上揭开了新的一页。
    古比雪夫水电站是苏联高度发展的科学技术的结晶。科学家与工人们紧密合作，大胆创造，打破了西方资本主义学者们关于在粘土质和沙质地基上不能修建大型水力发电站的“论证”。古比雪夫水电站的巨型水电站厂房，就是建筑在粘土质的地基上的。
    古比雪夫水电站的建设速度和规模在世界上都是空前的。它的生产成本也很低。据专家计算，六年的时间就可以从水电生产的电力中收回水电站的全部建筑费。自从1955年底开始发电到现在，已收回建筑费的20％。
    建设古比雪夫水电站的高度技术装备和完善的组织工作，在1955年秋天拦断伏尔加河河床时表现得特别突出。尽管在合龙的时候河水流量每秒钟达四千立方公尺左右，但是只花了十九个小时就把伏尔加河这条汹涌的欧洲大河的洪流制伏了。而美国在修筑麦克—内里堤坝时，为了要拦断哥伦比亚河河床（虽然这条河的流量要比伏尔加河小得多），却花了一千一百四十个小时。
    古比雪夫水电站安装的二十台带旋转式叶片的水轮机的发电能力在世界上也是空前的。每台水轮机的总重量是三千二百吨，高度超过十层的楼房，工作轮的直径有九公尺多。它的第一台水轮机在1955年年底开始运转，而到1957年10月所有二十台水轮机都全部投入生产。到目前为止，世界水利工程建筑方面还从来没有过这样快的速度。
    苏联科学家正在设计把彼乔拉和维契格达等北方河流的部分流水引入伏尔加河。这个计划实现以后，伏尔加河的水量将大大增加。那时候，古比雪夫水电站的发电能力将从两百一十万瓩增加到三百万瓩。（附图片）
