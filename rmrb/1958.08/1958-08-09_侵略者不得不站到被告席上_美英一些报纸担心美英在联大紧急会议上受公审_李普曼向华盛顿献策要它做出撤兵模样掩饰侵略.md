Xinhua News Agency, July 7th Dispatch from TASS, New York: "New York Herald Tribune" commentator Lippmann, commenting on the upcoming UN General Assembly emergency meeting, called on the United States to begin withdrawing troops from Lebanon before the meeting convenes, and said that a way must be sought to have British troops withdraw from Jordan soon.

Lippmann wrote: "The high-level meeting that we never wanted has been avoided at this stage, and instead we have agreed to engage in a fierce, difficult, and complex struggle. The problem we face is: how to prevent this UN General Assembly session from becoming a public court to try the Americans and British for their armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan." Lippmann warned in this regard that it would be "unwise" to over-rely on the logic of the American arguments, or on the "eloquence" of Lodge, Dulles, or even President Eisenhower.

Lippmann said: "We do not have a majority at the General Assembly to serve us. We will not get the necessary two-thirds vote on every important issue, even if we get the support of all the American republics, all the Western European countries, and the Commonwealth countries - Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and our protectorates in Asia.
The current composition of the General Assembly is an unfavorable venue for defending the Anglo-American military intervention in the two Asian countries."

Lippmann suggested, "First of all, the number and equipment of the American troops in Lebanon should be stopped from increasing and should be reduced. The newly elected president of Lebanon is preparing to ask us to leave, and we had better start withdrawing before we are asked to leave. We do not need 15,000 troops to defend President Chamoun for a few weeks while he still has the legal right to remain in office. In addition, it would not be bad to use our diplomatic influence in Beirut to persuade Chamoun to go abroad for a vacation now. In this way, we can order the withdrawal of all our troops before the General Assembly convenes.

"The problem of British withdrawal from Jordan is much more difficult to solve. However, there is almost no doubt that a way must be found for the British to withdraw from there. Because the 2,000 paratroopers stationed in Amman are enough to protect the King from losing his life, but they can never turn Jordan into a vibrant and independent kingdom. Sooner or later (and not too late) the paratroopers and the King must leave Jordan..."

Lippmann believes that "it would be a pity if London or Washington does not fulfill its responsibilities, if they are unwilling to attend the UN General Assembly with a constructive plan for Jordan and with real evidence of our withdrawal from Lebanon."

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th Dispatch from TASS, London, July 7th: Khrushchev's proposal to convene an emergency session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan remains the focus of attention of British newspapers.

British bourgeois newspapers are concerned that the Western countries will have to appear in the UN General Assembly as defendants responsible for their actions in the Near East. "News Chronicle" avoids talking about American armed intervention, calling on the Western countries to quickly formulate a "policy towards the Near East, focusing this policy on the economy."

The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail," on the one hand, believes that convening an emergency session of the UN General Assembly is "not a bad thing at all," while deliberately misleading readers on the eve of the UN General Assembly, trying to prove that the danger of acute conflict in the Middle East has been eliminated. However, the newspaper's attempt to defend the US-British aggression appears particularly clumsy in light of today's news. Today's news says that Britain is reinforcing troops to Jordan, and American planes are flying from Nicosia (Cyprus) to Jordan.

    侵略者不得不站到被告席上
    美英一些报纸担心美英在联大紧急会议上受公审
    李普曼向华盛顿献策要它做出撤兵模样掩饰侵略
    新华社7日讯  据塔斯社纽约7日讯：“纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼评论准备召开的联合国大会紧急会议，他呼吁美国在会议召开之前就开始从黎巴嫩撤退军队，并且说，必须寻求使英军在最近从约旦撤出的办法。
    李普曼写道：“我们从来就不想开的高级会议在现阶段已经避免掉了，代之而来的是我们同意进行一场激烈的、困难的、复杂的搏斗。我们面临的问题是：如何防止联大这次会议变成公开的法庭来审判美国人和英国人对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉。”李普曼在这方面警告说：过分地指望美国的论点的逻辑，指望洛奇、杜勒斯甚至艾森豪威尔总统的“口才”是“不明智的”。
    李普曼说：“在大会上我们没有能为我们效劳的多数。我们不会在每个重要问题上都得到必须的三分之二票数，即使我们能得到所有美洲共和国、所有西欧国家和英联邦国家——澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大以及我们在亚洲的保护国的支持。
    由目前成员组成的大会，对为英美军队干涉两个亚洲国家作辩解这点来说，是一个不利的场所。”
    李普曼建议，“首先应当停止增加在黎巴嫩的美军的数量和装备，并且要加以缩减。黎巴嫩新当选的总统准备请我们走开，我们最好在没请我们走之前就开始撤退。我们不需要用一万五千名军队在夏蒙总统还有合法权利留任的时候去保卫他几个星期。此外，利用我们在贝鲁特的外交影响，说服夏蒙现在出国去休假，这样做也不坏。这样一来，在大会召开之前我们就能下令撤退我们的全部军队。
      “英国人撤出约旦的问题要难解决得多。但是，必须找到英国人从那里撤退的方法，这几乎是毫无疑问的。因为驻在安曼的两千名伞兵足以保护国王免于丧命，但是他们永远无法把约旦变成一个富有生命力的、独立的王国。伞兵和国王迟早（而且不会太迟）必须离开约旦……”
    李普曼认为，“如果伦敦或华盛顿不履行自己的职责，如果它们不愿意带着关于约旦的建设性计划和我们撤出黎巴嫩的真凭实据去参加联合国大会，那将是可悲的事情”。
    新华社8日讯  据塔斯社伦敦7日讯：赫鲁晓夫提出的召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论关于美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队撤出约旦的问题的建议，仍然是英国报纸的注意中心。
    英国资产阶级报纸担心的是，在联合国大会上西方国家不得不以对近东的行为负责的被告身份出现。“新闻纪事报”对美国的武装干涉避而不谈，呼吁西方国家从速制定“对近东的政策，把这种政策的重点放在经济上”。
    保守党的“每日邮报”一方面认为召开联合国大会紧急会议“完全不是坏事”，同时又故意在联合国大会召开前夕迷惑读者，力图证明似乎中近东的冲突尖锐的危险已经消除了。但是，报纸替美英的侵略行动作辩解的企图，从今天的消息看来显得特别笨拙。今天的消息说：英国向约旦增援军队，美国飞机又从尼科西亚（塞浦路斯岛）飞往约旦。
