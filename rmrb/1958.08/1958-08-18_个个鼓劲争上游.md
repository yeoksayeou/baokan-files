　　Everyone Exerts Effort to Strive for the Upper Reaches
Stars fill the sky,
Lamps dot the ground in the thousands,
Singing rises from all directions like a roaring tide,
Waterwheels turn with a rhythmic sound.
Silver dragons enter the fields,
Drops of sweat sprinkle the soil,
Every crop grows with the wind,
Every commune member is full of vigor.
Everyone listens to the General Line,
Everyone exerts effort to strive for the upper reaches,
No one minds being tired from watering the fields every night,
Every crop gets a bumper harvest!
  (Nong Guang, Laiyang County, Shandong)

　　The Cooperative's Water Sings Year-Round
Many happy events in Shuguang Cooperative,
Irrigation canals link into a river.
Not afraid of the heavens not raining.
The cooperative's water sings year-round.
   (Shuguang Cooperative, Zhongxiang, Hubei)

　　个个鼓劲争上游天上繁繁一片星，地下点点万盏灯，歌声滔滔八方起，水车嘎嘎响连声。条条银龙入庄田，滴滴汗珠洒土中，棵棵庄稼随风长，个个社员干劲猛。人人听了总路线，个个鼓劲争上游，夜夜浇地不嫌累，块块庄稼得丰收！
  （山东掖县　农光）
　　社里长年水唱歌曙光社里喜事多，沟渠排灌连成河。不怕老天不下雨。社里长年水唱歌。
  （湖北锺祥曙光社）
