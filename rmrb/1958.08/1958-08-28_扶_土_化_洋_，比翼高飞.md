　　Supporting “Native” to Assimilate “Foreign,” Soaring Together
　　He Zhiping
    In the great leap forward of socialist construction in our country, a large number of "native experts" have emerged everywhere. They have used "native methods" to solve and are solving many scientific and technological problems in production and construction that "foreign experts" thought could not be solved, and have created many miracles that "foreign experts" dared not imagine. Why are native experts and native methods so vigorous and full of vitality, while most foreign experts and foreign methods are so comparatively clumsy and unable to achieve greater results? This is a question that is very thought-provoking. It is of great significance for the progress of our country's technological revolution and cultural revolution for all experts and intellectuals to seriously consider and ideologically solve this problem.
    This sharp contrast between native experts and native methods and foreign experts and foreign methods is a concrete reflection of the struggle between two lines in our country's production and construction and scientific research. The reason why native experts are vigorous and full of vitality is not because they have any extraordinary talent or profound scientific and technological cultivation, but because they have resolutely implemented the Party's instructions: to make science and technology serve politics and combine with productive labor, and to follow the mass line and the socialist line. All the inventions and creations of native experts are the result of hard work in production labor. The research they conduct is all to solve the practical problems raised in production. After painstaking research, various ideas and repeated experiments, they finally obtain solutions from practice. Therefore, they can not only correctly solve the urgent problems raised in production and construction according to specific circumstances, but also conform to the spirit of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. On the contrary, the reason why some foreign experts have not made such great contributions to production and construction is not because they are incompetent or lack knowledge, but because they consider themselves "experts," do not believe in the leadership of the Party, do not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and let science and technology be divorced from politics and production, taking the path of individualism and capitalism. They regard science and technology as their personal property, and their research does not serve production, nor does it combine with the practical problems raised in production, but is for personal fame and gain. The research topics are mostly based on subjective fabrication, and the research materials are mostly copied and pieced together from books. Conducting experiments in the laboratory, even if some achievements can be made, is mostly slow, few, poor, and costly, which cannot keep up with the requirements of our era. A large number of facts prove that if intellectuals with scientific and technological knowledge do not abandon individualism and the bourgeois line in scientific research, they will not make any major achievements. Therefore, it is a very urgent problem for intellectuals to seriously consider and choose which path to take.
    Of course, the question of line is not the whole problem. Here, the prejudice of worshiping foreign things and despising native things is also at play. Few intellectuals truly understand the meaning of "native." Most people who consider themselves experts are superstitious about foreigners and foreign books, look down on workers and peasants, and hold a arrogant attitude of disgust and contempt for things with the word "native." In their view, there is no room for "native" in the field of science and technology. However, in the tide of technological revolution and cultural revolution, those who show their talents are not them, but the working people who they look down upon, who have not received higher education or even do not know a few words, the so-called "native experts." Foreign experts are certainly not convinced. Therefore, in addition to lamenting that their music is too sophisticated for the common ear and that the Communist Party does not understand "science," the only way to comfort themselves is to nitpick on native methods. It is said that the inventions and creations of native experts are not based on anything, or that they are lucky hits, etc. But on this issue, these foreign experts still cannot stand their ground. It turns out that the so-called basis they are always thinking about is none other than the basis in books. They used the ideological weapons they took from idealism. In the view of materialists, the most reliable basis is objective facts, not any books. A yield of more than 7,000 catties per mu of wheat cannot be found in foreign books or among foreigners, but it is a fact in the liberated Chinese countryside. And facts are the most reliable basis for science. If the criterion of truth is human social practice, then what reason is there to say that the creations and inventions of native experts are not based on anything? What is lacking here is precisely the foreign experts, not the creations and inventions of the native experts. As for the slander that the inventions and creations of native experts are lucky hits, it is just using the fox's cleverness of comforting itself with sour grapes. As one comrade said well: "Why don't you try to hit it too!" Yes, foreign experts cannot explain why those who hit it are all native experts, while foreign experts who insist on taking the path of individualism and being divorced from reality have not hit even one.
    In fact, the facts have already answered the questions that foreign experts cannot understand. The reason why foreign experts and foreign methods cannot catch up with native experts and native methods is precisely because foreign experts are too superstitious about foreigners and despise workers and peasants, and are superstitious about books and despise the practice of productive labor. Foreign experts have learned foreign methods from foreigners and have a lot of book knowledge, which is originally a good thing. However, because they are superstitious about foreigners and the foreign methods in books, anything that foreigners have not said and foreign books have not recorded is regarded as unfounded, and they dare not think about it, let alone do it. Therefore, some useful things in foreign methods are also suffocated to death because foreign experts cannot digest foreign things and refuse to contact the soil and fresh air of actual things. The path that foreign experts have taken for many years is a narrow path, or even a dead end. Foreign experts should wake up as soon as possible, jump out of their studies and laboratories, absorb rich nutrition from the soil of productive labor, put in some effort to digest the foreign things they have eaten, and make the good seeds in foreign methods sprout and take root in the Chinese soil. Only in this way can foreign experts make great contributions to our country's socialist construction. Many young students, teaching assistants, and scientific researchers have already shown the light of their wisdom on this path. Because they have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, boldly contacted reality, and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to be original, they have made amazing achievements in science and technology. Many of their inventions and creations have not been done by foreigners, and cannot be found in foreign books. But it is the fruitful result of foreign methods taking root in our soil. It should be said that this is the path for the growth of our native experts and native methods. Under the same conditions, what young people can do, experts and professors with more scientific knowledge should also be able to do. The key issue lies in whether experts and professors can change the erroneous stand and attitude of bourgeois intellectuals.
    The so-called issue of changing the bourgeois stand and attitude still comes back to the issue of being both red and expert.
    Whether intellectuals can be red and whether they can make contributions to science depends on whether they are willing to break the superstition of foreigners and foreign books, and whether they change the attitude of contempt they have adopted towards workers, peasants, working masses, native experts, and native methods. If intellectuals break the superstition of foreigners and foreign books, then they will develop feelings for native experts and native methods, abandon the past attitude of aversion and rejection of native experts and native methods, and then support and learn from native experts and native methods. While supporting and learning from native experts and native methods, they can use and digest the knowledge they have learned in the past. In this way, they can digest the knowledge in books through practice, absorb rich nutrition from the soil of practice, and then make new creations and inventions that surpass foreigners. We might as well call this step the effort of supporting "native" to assimilate "foreign." Only when intellectuals combine native and foreign things and make real achievements can they be said to have embarked on the road of being both red and expert.
    Combining native and foreign things, and promoting both native and foreign things, is the correct path for developing our country's science and technology with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and for implementing the technological revolution and cultural revolution. It is also the correct path for being both red and expert. Only by supporting native and assimilating foreign things in practice can intellectuals spread their wings and fly high in science and technology. Whoever does not recognize this truth, or holds a skeptical attitude towards this truth, will be thrown far behind by the times.

　　扶“土”化“洋”，比翼高飞
　　贺致平
    在我国社会主义建设大跃进声中，到处涌现出了大批的“土专家”，他们用“土办法”解决了并正在解决着生产建设中许多“洋专家”们认为不能解决的科学技术问题，创造了许多“洋专家”们所不敢设想的奇迹。为什么土专家、土办法是这样轰轰烈烈、生气蓬勃，而大多数洋专家、洋办法竟是这样相形见拙、做不出更大的成绩来呢？这是一个很足以发人深省的问题。一切专家和知识分子们，认真地考虑并从思想上解决这个问题，这对我国技术革命和文化革命的进展是具有重大意义的。
    土专家、土办法与洋专家、洋办法的这种鲜明的对比，是我国生产建设和科学研究中两条路线斗争的具体反映。土专家之所以轰轰烈烈、生气蓬勃，并不是由于他们有什么过人的天才和高深的科学技术修养，而是由于他们坚决执行了党的指示：使科学技术为政治服务并与生产劳动相结合，走群众路线、社会主义路线的结果。所有土专家的发明创造，都是在生产劳动中刻苦钻研出来的。他们所进行的研究都是为了解决生产中所提出的实际问题，经过苦心钻研，种种设想和反复实验，最后从实践中获得解决的。因此，他们不但能根据具体情况正确解决生产和建设中所提出的迫切问题，而且符合于鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的精神。反之，一些洋专家之所以对生产建设的贡献没有这样大，并不是由于他们本身低能或知识不多，乃是由于他们以“内行”自居，不相信党的领导，不相信群众的智慧和力量，而使科学技术脱离政治、脱离生产、走个人主义路线、资本主义路线的结果。他们把科学技术看作个人的私产，他们的研究不是为生产服务，不结合生产当中所提出的实际问题，而是为了个人成名成家，研究题目多凭主观虚构，而研究的材料又多是从书本上东抄西凑。在实验室里进行试验，即使能有些成就，也多是少慢差费，赶不上我们时代的要求。大量的事实证明，具有科学技术知识的知识分子如果不抛弃科学研究中的个人主义和资产阶级的路线，他们将不会作出任何重大成就。因此，知识分子认真地考虑和选择一下自己走什么路线，实在是一个非常迫切的问题。
    当然，路线问题还不是问题的全部，这里还有崇洋鄙土的门户之见在作怪。知识分子中真正懂得“土”的意义的还很少，多数以专家自居的人，迷信洋人，迷信洋书，看不起工农，对带“土”字的东西抱着厌恶和鄙弃的狂妄态度。在他们看来，在科学技术的领域里是不容许有什么“土”的位子的。然而，在技术革命和文化革命的浪潮中，大显身手的却不是他们，而是为他们所看不起的没有受过高等教育甚至是不识几个字的劳动人民，就是所谓“土专家”。洋专家们当然不服气。于是他们除了慨叹曲高和寡，共产党不懂“科学”之外，唯一可以为自己解嘲的办法便是对土办法吹毛求疵。据说土专家的发明和创造是没有根据的，或者说是冒碰的等等。但就在这个问题上，这些洋专家们仍然是站不住脚的。原来他们念念不忘的所谓根据，不是别的，正是书本上的根据。他们使出了从唯心主义那里拿来的思想武器。在唯物主义者看来，最可靠的根据是客观事实而不是任何书本。小麦亩产七千多斤，这在洋书和洋人那里当然找不出根据，但在解放了的中国农村却是事实。而事实却是科学的最可靠的根据。如果真理的标准是人类的社会实践的话，那么有什么理由说，土专家们的创造和发明是没有根据的呢？在这里没有根据的恰恰是洋专家，而不是土专家的创造和发明。至于诬蔑土专家的发明和创造是冒碰的说法，只不过是袭用狐狸以酸葡萄来安慰自己的馋嘴的聪明而已。有一位同志说得好：“你们倒是也来碰一碰呀！”是的，洋专家们不能解释，为什么碰着的偏偏都是土专家，而坚持走个人主义路线的脱离实际的洋专家却没有碰上一个。
    其实，洋专家们不能理解的问题，事实早已作了回答。洋专家、洋办法之所以赶不上土专家、土办法，正是由于洋专家过于迷信洋人和轻视工农，迷信书本而轻视生产劳动的实践。洋专家从洋人那里学了洋办法，又有许多书本知识，这本来是件好事。但由于他们迷信洋人和书本上的洋办法，洋人没有说过，洋书上没有记载的事，一律被看作没有根据，不敢去想，更不敢去做，所以洋办法里有些对我们有用的东西，也由于洋专家的食洋不化，拒绝接触实际事物的土壤和新鲜空气而被窒息死了。洋专家们多年来所走的道路乃是一条羊肠小道，甚至是一条死胡同。洋专家们应该及早省悟，从书斋、实验室里跳出来，到生产劳动的土壤中吸取丰富的营养，对吃下的洋东西下一番消化的工夫，使洋办法中好的种子在中国的土壤上发芽生根。只有这样，洋专家才能够对我国社会主义建设作出巨大的贡献。许多年青的学生、助教和科学研究人员，已经在这条道路上闪烁出他们的智慧的光芒。他们由于破除了迷信，解放了思想，大胆接触实际，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢独创的共产主义风格，因而在科学技术上作出了惊人的成就。他们的许多发明和创造是洋人没有这样做过，而在洋书上也找不到根据的。但它却是洋办法在我们的土壤上生根而结出的丰硕果实。应该说这是我们的土专家、土法办成长的道路。在同样的条件下，青年人能够做到的，有更多科学知识的专家和教授们也应该能够做到。关键问题就在于专家教授能否改变资产阶级知识分子的错误的立场和态度。
    所谓改变资产阶级立场和态度问题，仍然回到了红和专的问题。
    知识分子能不能红，能不能在科学上作出贡献，还要看他肯不肯打破对洋人、洋书的迷信，是否改变对工农劳动群众和土专家、土办法所采取的轻视态度。知识分子如果打破了对洋人、洋书的迷信，那么他就会对土专家、土办法发生感情，抛去过去厌恶和排斥土专家、土办法的态度，进而去扶持和学习土专家、土办法，在扶持和学习土专家、土办法的同时，运用和消化他过去所学到的知识。这样他就能够把书本上的知识经过实践加以消化，并从实践的泥土中吸取丰富的营养，然后作出新的超过洋人的创造和发明。这步工夫我们不妨叫做扶“土”化“洋”的工夫。知识分子只有使土洋结合起来，作出真正的成绩，才能说是走上红专的大道。
    土洋结合、土洋并举，这是多快好省地发展我国科学技术、实行技术革命、文化革命的正确道路，也是又红又专的正确道路。知识分子只有在实践上扶土化洋，才能在科学技术上展翅高飞。谁不承认这个真理，或对这个真理抱怀疑态度，谁就要被时代远远抛在后面。
