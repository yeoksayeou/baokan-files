Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Ministry of Public Security recently held the Ninth National Public Security Conference. This was an important rectification meeting on our country's public security work front. The conference, following the rectification method, summarized the rich experience of public security work in the nine years since the founding of the nation, and, according to the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, discussed the future tasks.

National public security work conferences have been regular annual meetings almost every year since the founding of the nation. This conference started on June 24th and ended on August 16th. The representatives attending the conference included directors of public security bureaus of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as some business leading cadres, some responsible persons from special districts, counties, and urban public security sub-bureaus, and some heads of public security police stations and directors of security committees from the grassroots level.

Because the conference fully used the rectification methods, which are to freely air views, put up big-character posters, fully promote democracy, and fully展开辩论, this enabled all the cadres present to systematically recognize the achievements and experience of the great struggle of the past nine years, clarify the future work direction, and universally improve the Marxist-Leninist level of all the cadres present.

During the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong and General Secretary Deng Xiaoping and other party and state leaders received all the representatives; members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, alternate members of the Political Bureau Lu Dingyi, Bo Yibo and other responsible comrades from other central departments, attended the meeting and delivered important speeches and gave important instructions.

Minister of Public Security Luo Ruiqing made a summary of the conference discussion. Deputy Minister Xu Zirong made a report on the current situation and future work.

The conference considered that our country’s struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and party committees at all levels, and under the leadership of the State Council and people's committees at all levels, and through the efforts of the broad masses of people, has achieved a great achievement of historical significance. On a nationwide scale, it has basically eliminated counter-revolutionaries and has gained systematic and relatively complete experience. The conference gave high praise to the work experience of our country in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, especially the experience of suppressing counter-revolutionaries through party committee leadership and the mass line, and considered this to be a unique creation of our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution.

The conference believed that in 1957, when the bourgeois rightists frantically attacked the Party, bourgeois rightists and right-leaning opportunists attempted to overthrow the achievements of our country's suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This attack on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was actually an attack on the Communist Party, on the dictatorship of the proletariat, on the people, and on socialism, and was a reflection of the struggle between the two roads of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism. Facts have once again proven that the achievements of our country's suppression of counter-revolutionaries can withstand inspection and testing and cannot be overthrown by anyone.

The conference also discussed the current situation of the struggle between the enemy and ourselves and the future tasks, believing that the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in the country are even weaker, and our country’s social order is even better; however, class struggle still exists, and counter-revolutionary sabotage activities cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, public security organs still have their own work to do. In the future, we must continue to be vigilant, absolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the mass line, and, on the basis of the victory of the nine-year struggle, better complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the country, so as to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and provide a more secure guarantee for the realization of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

    绝对依靠党委领导  坚决贯彻群众路线
　　我国肃反工作取得丰富经验
　　全国公安会议用整风方法总结了建国九年来的工作
    新华社19日讯  中央公安部最近举行了第九次全国公安会议。这是我国公安工作战线上的一次重要的整风会议。会议按照整风的方法总结了建国九年以来公安工作的丰富经验，并且根据党的“八大”第二次会议的精神，讨论了今后的工作任务。
    全国性的公安工作会议，是建国以来差不多一年一度的常规性的例会。这次会议从6月24日开始到8月16日结束，出席会议的代表有各省、市、自治区公安厅、局长和一部分业务领导干部，还有一些专署、县、城市公安分局的负责人，以及一些来自基层的公安派出所长、治安保卫委员会主任等。
    由于会议充分地使用了整风的一套方法，就是大鸣大放、出大字报，充分地发扬民主，充分地展开辩论，这样就使得全体到会干部系统地认清了过去九年来伟大斗争的成绩和经验，明确了今后的工作方向，使所有到会干部普遍提高了马克思列宁主义水平。
    在会议期间，毛泽东主席和邓小平总书记等党和国家的领导同志接见了全体代表；中共中央政治局委员董必武、彭真、陈毅、谭震林、政治局候补委员陆定一、薄一波等同志以及中央其他部门一些负责同志，到会讲话并作了重要指示。
    公安部长罗瑞卿作了会议讨论的总结。副部长徐子荣就当前形势和今后工作作了报告。
    会议认为，我国肃清反革命的斗争，在中共中央、毛主席和各级党委的领导下，在国务院和各级人民委员会的领导下，通过广大人民的努力，已经取得了有历史意义的伟大成就。就全国范围来说，已经基本上肃清了反革命分子，并且取得了系统的比较完整的经验。对于我国肃反斗争的工作经验，特别是党委领导、群众路线的肃反经验，会议给予了很高的评价，认为这是我们党和毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合的一个独特的创造。
    会议认为，在1957年资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，资产阶级右派分子、右倾机会主义分子企图推翻我国肃反斗争的成绩，这种对肃反的攻击，实际上是对共产党、对无产阶级专政、对人民、对社会主义的攻击，是无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的反映。事实再一次证明，我国肃反斗争的成绩是经得起检查和考验的，是任何人也推翻不了的。
    会议还讨论了目前敌我斗争的形势和今后的工作任务，认为目前国内残余反革命势力更加削弱，我国社会秩序更加良好；但是，阶级斗争还存在，反革命破坏活动就不可能完全没有，因而，公安机关仍然有自己的工作，今后必须继续提高警惕，必须绝对依靠党的领导，坚决贯彻群众路线，在九年斗争胜利的基础上，更好地完成党和国家交给自己的任务，以便进一步巩固无产阶级专政，为实现党的社会主义建设总路线提供更加安全的保证。
