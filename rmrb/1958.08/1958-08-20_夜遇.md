	Night Encounter

	It was after ten past eleven when I came out of the meeting place. The stars filled the sky, but the moon had not yet risen. In the night breeze, the large-leaved poplars rustled; under the starlight, the wheat stacks were dimly visible in twos and threes. From the meeting place to Baijiazhuang, where we were staying, was about half a li, most of which was a path through the fields, except for a small section of road. The wheat had already ripened, and these past few days, the villagers had been busy harvesting. Walking on the ridges of the fields, one could smell the fragrance of wheat drifting in the air. The night was still and quiet. The prairie was asleep, and the people who had labored all day must all be in dreamland.

	As I approached Baijiazhuang, I noticed someone walking towards me. Who could it be? We walked closer and closer.

	"Just getting back?!" the person asked.

	I recognized it as the voice of Bai Lao Er from the same courtyard. These simple three words were full of concern for us.

	"Just getting back," I replied.

	"Get some rest soon, you have to work early tomorrow."

	"What about you?" I asked.

	"Working the night shift to cut wheat," he answered happily.

	"It's almost twelve o'clock."

	"The moon hasn't risen yet!"

	We passed each other.

	Back at home, lying on the kang, I couldn't fall asleep for a long time.

	Around four o'clock, I was awakened by the noisy voices of people. What was going on? I threw on my clothes and went outside, where I happened to run into Bai Lao Er, who was returning from the fields. From him, I learned that they had just finished work and were heading back.

	"What time is it?" he asked.

	"Four fifteen," I replied, "When do you start work?"

	"Six o'clock."

	"Isn't that too little rest?"

	"It's nothing. We're rushing to finish cutting the wheat in five days and five nights," he replied confidently. With that, he went inside.

	The moonlight in the courtyard was like water. Outside the courtyard, the sounds of people gradually faded away. In another hour or two, people would once again appear on the worksite in battle-ready posture.

	As I lay down again, I was so excited that I couldn't fall asleep.

    夜遇
    十一点多从会场里出来，繁星满天，月亮还没有升起。夜风里，大叶白杨萧萧作响；星光下，三三五五的麦垛隐约可见。从会场到我们住的白家庄有半里多路程，中间除了一小段大路以外，大部分都是田间小道。麦子已经成熟了，这几天，老乡正忙着收割。走在地埂子上，可以闻到飘散在空中的麦子的清香。夜，静悄悄。草原，睡着了，劳动了一天的人们该都已进入梦乡。
    快到白家庄的时候，我发现对面走来了一个人。是谁呢？我们越走越近。
    “才回来？！”对方问。
    我辨出了那是同院子白老二的声音。简单的三个字里充满了对我们的关心。
    “才回来”，我这样回答。
    “快休息吧，明天早起还要劳动。”
    “你呢？”我问。
    “加夜班割麦子。”他高高兴兴地回答。
    “快十二点了。”
    “月亮还没有升起呢！”
    我们交肩而过。
    回到家，躺在炕上，我久久地不能入睡。
    四点多，我被嘈杂的人声吵醒。什么事呢？我披衣出门，正好碰上从地里回来的白老二，从他那儿知道，他们才收工，人们正往回走。
    “什么时候了？”他问。
    “四点一刻”，我回答，“什么时候上工呢？”
    “六点。”
    “休息不嫌少吗？”
    “没有什么。突击五天五夜割完麦子。”他满有信心地回答。说完，他就进屋去了。
    院子里月光如水。院外，人声渐去渐远。一两个钟头以后，人们又将以战斗的姿态出现在工地上。
    当我再度躺下，我激动的怎么也睡不着了。
