    Temporarily Do Not Come to Visit
    After the People's Daily published the news of the successful creation of a wooden motor by Zhang Yunshu of our factory, many places have telegraphed saying they want to send people to visit. However, Zhang Yunshu took the motor to Tianjin on the 2nd to attend a meeting, and will not return to the factory until about the 18th. Comrades who want to visit, please postpone your trip to the factory.

    暂时不要来参观
    人民日报刊登我厂张云树木制电动机成功的消息后，许多地方来电说是要派人来参观。可是张云树已在2日带上电动机往天津开会去了，约在18日以后才能回厂，要参观的同志，请缓来厂。
