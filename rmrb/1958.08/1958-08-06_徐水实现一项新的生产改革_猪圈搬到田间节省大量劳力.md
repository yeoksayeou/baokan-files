Xushui County, Hebei Province, has completed a new production reform. Based on vigorously developing collective pig farming, they have begun to change the old practice of locating pigsties in villages, moving the pigsties to the open fields. To date, the county has established 209 pig farms in the fields, and all of the county's more than 83,000 pigs have been moved to the new pig farms. Some of these field pig farms are located one or two li, or two or three li from the village; others are seven or eight li away.

The reform measure of moving pigsties to the open fields was decided upon after repeated study at the Xushui County Party Committee's plenary session on May 10 and 11. Implementing this reform can resolve four long-standing contradictions in pig farming and is of great benefit to developing production.

First, it can resolve the contradiction between the need for large-scale manure accumulation and the shortage of labor and animal power. Xushui County needs to accumulate 23.4 million cartloads of pig manure this year, which requires transporting soil to the villages to line the sties, and then hauling the manure from the villages to the fields after it has rotted. This back-and-forth requires a great deal of labor and animal power. According to current statistical data from Xushui County, one person and one cart can generally haul eight cartloads of soil per day; delivering manure takes one person and one cart five trips per day. Based on this efficiency, 23.4 million cartloads of manure, including hauling soil and delivering manure, would require over 7.6 million labor days per year. If fixed personnel and carts are dedicated solely to this task, without attending to other farm work throughout the year, it would still require over 21,100 laborers and the same number of livestock and carts. Mobilizing such a large amount of labor and animal power to haul soil and deliver manure would affect the intensive and meticulous cultivation of crops. Moving the pigsties from the villages to the fields, appropriately dispersed across the land, allows for on-site soil collection and on-site manure spreading. Preliminary estimates suggest that 1.2 million cartloads of fertilizer can be accumulated before wheat planting in the fall, saving over 240,000 labor days.

Second, it can resolve the contradiction of uneven soil fertility and widely varying yields. Xushui County has over 863,000 mu of land, but only over 360,000 mu have relatively fertile soil and high yields. These lands are mostly near the villages. The remaining 500,000 mu, located further from the villages, have historically received very little manure, and their yields are far lower than those of the land surrounding the villages. Now, by appropriately establishing pigsties on these lands that are further from the villages and have poorer soil quality, it is possible to increase manure and improve the soil. This is a very powerful measure for increasing grain yields over a large area.

Third, it can resolve the contradiction between developing pig farming and pig mortality. Pigsties in villages are crowded and chaotic, with more opportunities for disease transmission, and prevention is more difficult. Moving the pigsties to the fields, with dedicated personnel managing the pigs and strictly controlling access by outsiders, can prevent and reduce the invasion of infectious diseases such as swine fever.

Fourth, it can resolve the contradiction between pig farming and manure accumulation, and the elimination of the four pests and hygiene. Eliminating flies and mosquitoes and ensuring the people's health is also an important task in rural areas, both now and in the future. However, if pigsties are concentrated in and around villages, with pigsties everywhere, mosquitoes and flies will breed and proliferate. Moving the pigsties to the fields naturally resolves this contradiction, which is also of great benefit to improving environmental hygiene.

Xushui County now proposes implementing the reform of moving pigsties to the fields because the conditions are in place. Due to the development of collective pig farming, each agricultural cooperative now has professional pig management personnel and feeders, and each cooperative also has a pig feed processing plant. Thus, moving the pig farms to the fields, with the feeders and feed processing plants moving along with them, will not pose any difficulties. Secondly, agricultural cooperatives also have the need to establish pig farms in the fields. Since the launch of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, cadres and members have begun to experience that labor and animal power cannot meet the needs of the current Great Leap Forward in agriculture, and have also thought about moving pig farms to the fields to save the large amount of labor and animal power occupied by hauling soil and delivering manure. Juguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town moved its pig farm to cultivated land more than two li away from home in March of this year. Mijia Ying Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongsuo Ying Township has also built pigsties in the northeast corner, more than five li away from the village, and brought in more than 100 pigs, using on-site manure accumulation to transform the nearby sandy land.

    徐水实现一项新的生产改革
    猪圈搬到田间节省大量劳力
    本报讯　河北徐水县完成了一项新的生产改革。他们在大力发展集体养猪的基础上，着手改变猪圈设在村里的老规矩，把猪圈搬到野地里。到目前为止，全县已在田间建立了二百零九个养猪场，全县八万三千多头猪都已经搬到新猪场饲养。这些田间猪场有的离村一、二里或二、三里；也有的七、八里。
    把猪圈搬到野地里这一项改革措施，是在5月10日、11日中共徐水县委全会上，经过反复研究后做出决定的。实行这一改革，可以解决养猪事业中长期存在的四项矛盾，对于发展生产有很大的好处。
    第一，它可以解决大量积肥和劳力、畜力不足的矛盾。徐水县今年要积猪肥两千三百四十万车，既需要往村里运土垫圈，把肥沤好后又需要再从村里拉到地内。这样一来一去需要花费很大的劳力和畜力。根据徐水县目前实际材料的统计，拉垫圈土一般的一个人、一辆车一天可以拉八车；送粪一个人一辆车一天可以送五趟。按这个效率来计算，两千三百四十万车粪肥，连拉土带送粪，一年就需要占用七百六十多万个劳动日。如果固定专人专车，一年四季其他农活一概不管，也需要占用两万一千一百多个劳动力和相同数量的牲畜和车辆。动员这样庞大的劳力和畜力拉土送粪，就会影响到农作物的精耕细作。把猪圈从村里挪到野外，适当地分散到地块里，可以做到就地取土、就地撒粪。据初步估计，到秋季种麦前可以积一百二十万车肥料，能节省二十四万多个劳动日。
    第二，可以解决土地肥瘦不匀产量悬殊的矛盾。徐水县共有八十六万三千多亩土地，土质较肥产量较高的只有三十六万多亩。这些地多是村子周围的近地。其余五十万亩离村稍远的地，向来就很少上粪，产量远远赶不上村庄周围的土地。现在把猪圈适当地建立在这些离村较远、土质瘠薄的土地上，就可以做到增加粪肥改良土壤。这对提高大面积的粮食产量，是一项非常有力的措施。
    第三，可以解决发展养猪和猪只死亡的矛盾。猪圈在村内人多杂乱，传染疾病机会较多，预防也比较困难。把猪圈挪到野外，猪只设有专人管理，严格控制闲人出入，这样就可以制止和减弱猪瘟等传染病的侵袭。
    第四，可以解决养猪积肥和除四害讲卫生的矛盾。消灭苍蝇、蚊子，保障人民健康，这也是当前和今后农村中一项重要任务。但是，如果把猪圈都集中在村子里和村边，满村到处都是猪圈，蚊蝇就会在这里繁殖孳生。猪圈挪到了野外，这个矛盾自然也就得到解决了，这对改造环境卫生也是有很大好处的。
    徐水县现在提出实行把猪圈挪到野外这一改革，是具备了条件的。由于集体养猪事业的发展，每个农业社都有了专业养猪管理人员和饲养员，同时每个社里也都有了猪饲料加工厂。这样，养猪场挪到野外，饲养员和饲料加工厂随着也搬到野外，不会有什么困难。其次，农业社也有在野外建立养猪场的要求。因为自从开展农业生产大跃进以来，干部和社员已经开始体验到了劳力和畜力不能适应当前农业大跃进的需要，也想到了把养猪场挪到野外，节省拉土、送粪所占用的大量劳力和畜力。城关镇炬光农业社，在今年3月间就已经把猪场挪到了离家二里多地的耕地里。中所营乡米家营农业社，也已经在离村五里多地的东北角盖了猪圈，弄去了一百多头猪，通过就地积肥，来改造附近一带的薄沙地。
