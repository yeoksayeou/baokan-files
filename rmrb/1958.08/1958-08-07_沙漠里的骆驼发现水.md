    Camels in the Desert Finding Water
    "When camels in the desert find water, no reins can hold them back."
      --Arab proverb
    [Deserts and camels have always been symbols of the Arab world. The Arab people have long groaned under the enslavement of imperialists, and their desire for freedom is as urgent as a camel's thirst for water in the desert. Once the Arab people see their direction clearly and embark on the road of struggle for national liberation, no "U.S. Aid," "Eisenhower Doctrine," "Baghdad Pact" or other threatening and enticing reins and shackles can stop them.]

    沙漠里的骆驼发现水
    “当沙漠里的骆驼发现了水的时候，什么缰绳也不能勒住它。”
      ——阿拉伯谚语
    〔沙漠和骆驼一向是阿拉伯世界的象征。阿拉伯民族长期呻吟在帝国主义者的奴役下，他们渴望自由正如骆驼在沙漠里渴望水一样迫切，当阿拉伯人一旦看清了自己的方向走上为民族解放而斗争的道路时，什么“美援”、“艾森豪威尔主义”、“巴格达条约”等等威胁利诱的缰绳和枷锁，统统阻止不住他们了。〕
