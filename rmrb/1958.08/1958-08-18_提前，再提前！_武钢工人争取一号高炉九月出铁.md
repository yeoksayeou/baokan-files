	Earlier, Even Earlier!
	Wuhan Steel Workers Strive for No. 1 Blast Furnace to Produce Iron in September
	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 16th (Reporter Cao Baoming): The builders of Wuhan Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace are currently concentrating their efforts on the intense installation of the final 3,000-plus tons of mechanical equipment, constructing the internal railway and drainage works, and striving to produce iron ahead of schedule in September.
	Currently, the blast furnace body and the hot-blast stove, washing tower, electrostatic precipitator, gas pipes over two meters in diameter, hot-blast pipes, and thin steam pipes and cables beside it have formed a dense aerial pipe network around the blast furnace. More than ten kilometers of water supply and drainage pipes are also crisscrossing underground. The ten belt corridors for transporting materials, like ladders to heaven, extend from the ground to the surface and then to the sky. Now, the blast furnace body has been lined with fire-resistant bricks and fitted with the large and small bells and distributors for charging materials at the top of the furnace, and balancing rods and inlet branch pipes are being installed. The three hot-blast stoves and two blowers are also being pressure-tested and test-run, and will soon begin baking the furnace. The necessary "six connections" for production have been connected to electricity and water, and larger-capacity water pumps are currently being installed to ensure a sufficient supply of production water. Other connections such as gas, steam, compressed air, and railways will also be connected successively within the month. The material supply system has also been fitted with a tippler and a loading hoist, and is rushing to repair the last belt corridor and install the equipment for the storage pit. The huge weighing car was also rushed from the Soviet Union to the Chinese border in nine days and will soon be transported to the construction site.
	The Wuhan Steel General Party Committee comprehensively inspected the No. 1 Blast Furnace project at the beginning of the month and believes that there are still 10% to 12% of the construction and installation work to be completed, and the task is still very arduous. The General Party Committee requested that the company give full play to its own mechanical equipment capabilities, step up the manufacturing of small equipment necessary for blast furnace production, and require the seven engineering units working on the blast furnace site to strengthen communist collaboration and work closely together to strive to put the originally scheduled No. 1 Blast Furnace into production on October 1st ahead of schedule next month. The employees participating in the construction of No. 1 Blast Furnace have responded to the call of the General Party Committee one after another. All employees in this work area also guaranteed to complete the installation of all electrical equipment of the blast furnace before the 20th of this month.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 17th: Three hundred production workers and seventy production cadres of Wuhan Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace have entered the site to work. Production experts sent by the Soviet Union have also arrived at the Wuhan Steel Ironmaking Plant.
	In the production team of Wuhan Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace, 110 workers and more than 50 cadres were transferred from Anshan Iron and Steel, 40 workers were trained by Benxi, Fushun, Shijingshan, Chongqing and other steel plants, and 9 cadres were sent to the Soviet Union to study new equipment control. These people are the production backbone of No. 1 Blast Furnace. In addition, there are 150 electrical and mechanical workers and workers who have been transferred from the shoe and hat industry recruited in Wuhan.
	Now, this team has entered the site to undertake the task of installing 1,000 tons of equipment, and become familiar with the production equipment during the installation process, striving to start iron production at No. 1 Blast Furnace in September.
	The Soviet production experts, headed by Nie Dek, include smelting, machinery, electrical, furnace building and instrumentation trades. They began teaching technical courses at the ironmaking plant on the 11th.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 17th: A large amount of ore needed for the production of Wuhan Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is being transported from five provinces north and south of the Yangtze River. More than 50,000 tons of these ores have now been transported to Wuhan Steel.

　　提前，再提前！
　　武钢工人争取一号高炉九月出铁
    据新华社武汉16日电　新华社记者曹葆铭报道：武钢一号高炉的建设者，目前正集中力量紧张安装最后三千多吨机械设备、修筑厂内铁路和排水工程，力争提前在9月里出铁。
    现在，高炉本体和它旁边的热风炉、洗涤塔、电除尘器、直径两公尺多粗的煤气管、热风管和细小的蒸气管、电缆等，已在高炉周围构成密集的空中管网。十多公里长的上下水道也在地下纵横交错。运料的十道皮带通廊，像天梯一样，从地下伸向地面，再伸向高空。现在，高炉本体已砌好了耐火砖，安上了炉顶装料的大钟、小钟和布料器，正在安装平衡杆和进风支管。三座热风炉和两台鼓风机也正在试压、试车，很快就要开始烘炉。生产必需的“六通”工程，已经通电、通水，目前正在安装能力更大的水泵，以保证充分供应生产用水。其他如煤气、蒸气、压缩空气、铁路等，也将先后在月内接通。供料系统也安好了翻车机和上料卷扬机，正在抢修最后一道皮带通廊和安装储料坑的设备。巨大的秤量车，也由苏联在九天内赶运到我国边境，很快就要运到工地。
    武钢总党委在月初全面检查了一号高炉工程，认为还有10％至12％的建筑安装工程量必须完成，任务还很艰巨。总党委要求充分发挥自己的机械设备能力，加紧制造高炉生产必须的小设备，要求在高炉工地施工的七个工程单位加强共产主义协作，密切配合，力争将原订一号高炉10月1日出铁的计划，提前在下个月就投入生产。参加一号高炉建设的职工，都纷纷响应总党委的号召。这个工区的全体职工还保证在本月20日前安完高炉全部电气设备。
    据新华社武汉17日电　武钢一号高炉的三百名生产工人和七十名生产干部，已经进场工作。由苏联派来的生产专家，也到了武钢炼铁厂。
    在武钢一号高炉这支生产队伍中，有一百一十名工人和五十多名干部是由鞍钢输送来的，有四十名工人是由本溪、抚顺、石景山、重庆等钢铁厂代训的，还有九名干部曾被派去苏联学习过新式设备控制。这些人都是一号高炉的生产骨干。另外还有一百五十名是在武汉招收的机电工人和鞋帽业转业的工人。
    现在，这支队伍已经进场承担了安装一千吨设备的任务，并从安装过程中熟悉生产设备情况，力争在9月里使一号高炉开始出铁。
    以聂德柯为首的苏联生产专家，包括冶炼、机械、电气、筑炉和计器等工种。他们从11日起就开始在炼铁厂讲技术课。
    据新华社武汉17日电　武钢一号高炉生产需要的大量矿石，正分头由长江南北五个省运来。这些矿石现在已有五万多吨运到了武钢。
