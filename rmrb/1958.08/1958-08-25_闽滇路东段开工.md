　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 24th: Construction has recently begun on the eastern section of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway—from Quanzhou to Zhangping. Officers and soldiers of a railway corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Fujian laborers have been arriving at the construction site in a steady stream, starting to build access roads, erect sheds, and excavate key tunnel projects.

　　Quanzhou is the starting point of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway, extending 150 kilometers to Zhangping. The Zhangping to Longyan section in western Fujian began construction in mid-June. Currently, 207 kilometers of the more than 350 kilometers of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway within Fujian province are under construction.
