　　Fearlessness and Miracles
　　By our reporter Xu Jiazhu
    In the coal and iron city of Benxi, there is a small local state-owned factory with fewer than seven hundred people—the Benxi Alloy Factory. Recently, more than 20,000 visitors from all over the country have seen a series of rare miracles there.
    This factory, which started in 1950 with only one large pot, two spoons, three molds, and four workers with limited technical knowledge, has grown into one of the leading non-ferrous metal alloy factories in China through self-reliance. Today, it can refine more than 270 kinds of precious alloys, including copper, lead, aluminum, tin, and nickel, becoming an indispensable assistant to more than 1,200 important enterprises in China. Many of the alloys it produces have reached international standards and are sold to Korea, Vietnam, Britain, New Zealand, Egypt, South Africa, and Southeast Asia.
    A valuable silicon-aluminum alloy is refined in other countries using modern electric furnaces or delicate small crucibles. However, the Benxi Alloy Factory refines it in an ancient Bagua furnace.
    It started like this: A young worker, Liu Wancheng, saw a Bagua furnace used for refining copper in a private factory in Tianjin. This was an ancient Chinese earthen furnace. He thought that if he could learn the skills of building a Bagua furnace, he could use it to try refining silicon-aluminum alloy. After obtaining the consent of technician Su Xinjun, they went together to a private factory in Tianjin.
    The capitalist of that private factory was afraid that the Benxi Alloy Factory would also build Bagua furnaces to refine copper, which would knock out his money-making business. He agreed to let them "visit," but put forward "three rules": first, no drawing diagrams; second, no taking photos; and third, no going near the Bagua furnace, only standing far away to watch.
    Su Xinjun and Liu Wancheng were worried. They discussed and decided to ignore the capitalist's tricks. The next day, they came to the workshop and found that a Bagua furnace had been shut down and was being prepared for maintenance. Liu Wancheng looked around, saw that no one was around, and wanted to crawl into the furnace chamber from the coal feeding port. Su Xinjun touched the outer wall of the furnace, which was very hot, and knew that the furnace chamber might be too hot and suffocating. He immediately grabbed Liu Wancheng's collar and dragged him out of the furnace opening.
    "Don't hold me back," Liu Wancheng said. "I'll crawl in to measure the internal dimensions of the furnace, and you write them down outside."
    Su Xinjun had to let go. He stood outside and listened to Liu Wancheng reporting the dimensions inside the furnace chamber, which he recorded. Suddenly, he heard Liu Wancheng panting several times in the furnace chamber, and then there was no sound. He thought something was wrong and immediately crawled into the furnace, dragging out Liu Wancheng, who had fainted from the heat. As soon as Liu Wancheng woke up, he wanted to crawl back in. Su Xinjun grabbed him again, but crawled into the furnace chamber himself. The two of them took turns going in and out, measuring and recording. By this time, they were covered in coal dust and had turned into two gray people. The workshop director shook his head as he watched them, saying, "I have never seen anyone crawl into a furnace chamber for a visit!"
    They learned from the workers that there was an old bricklayer named Master Fan in the factory who was skilled at building Bagua furnaces. They wanted to find him, but were afraid that the capitalist would stop them, so they waited outside the factory gate. As soon as Master Fan finished work and walked out of the factory gate, they stopped him. Master Fan was very hungry and wanted to go home for dinner. It took them a lot of effort to pull Master Fan into a small restaurant, where they drank and talked very congenially. Master Fan told them all the "secrets" of the Bagua furnace.
    When the two returned to Benxi, they immediately led the workers to build an eleven-Bagua furnace with a larger production capacity than the Bagua furnace. Liu Wancheng discussed with Wang Huaishun, the section chief, how to refine silicon-aluminum alloy in the eleven-Bagua furnace. Wang Huaishun was also a veteran. He originally only had a junior primary school education, but after coming to the alloy factory, he studied hard and could already understand many Russian original technical books and had translated some technical materials. Based on technical theory, he supported Liu Wancheng's proposal. They experimented in the eleven-Bagua furnace during night shifts and refined silicon-aluminum alloy before reporting to the factory management. However, some engineers did not know that the alloy had already been trial-produced and thought it was just a suggestion, so they cited classics, believing that the two concepts of Bagua furnace and silicon-aluminum alloy could not be linked together.
    As soon as this "definitive conclusion" was finished, the workers put the fully qualified silicon-aluminum alloy in front of the engineer. This left the engineer speechless and ashamed.
    Last year, Soviet metallurgical expert Istrin was greatly surprised when he saw silicon-aluminum alloy refined in the eleven-Bagua furnace at the alloy factory. He immediately asked what level of education the creators of this indigenous method had.
    "They graduated from the mountain village university," the factory director said with a smile.
    Istrin didn't understand at first. When he learned that the creators used to be farmers in the mountains, he said excitedly, "Good, you have ambition!"
    The Benxi Alloy Factory decided to smelt refined copper. This task fell on Su Xinjun again. To smelt refined copper, a reverberatory furnace had to be built. However, the factory did not have a single bricklayer who could build a furnace, no brick grinding machine, and no experience in repairing furnaces. The factory still decided to try boldly.
    Su Xinjun went to the labor bureau, selected fifteen strong young men, brought them back to the factory, and said to them:
    "Starting today, I will teach you how to learn smelting. I will test you, what is smelting?"
    "Don't understand!"
    Su Xinjun knew that it would not be clear to explain. The next day, he led fifteen young people to the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, watched the blast furnace smelting iron, and also visited people using machines to grind refractory bricks.
    "This is called smelting," Su Xinjun told them. After the "enlightenment education" at the scene ended, he immediately mobilized everyone to grind refractory bricks and start building a reverberatory furnace.
    "How can we grind bricks without a machine?" a worker asked.
    "Who said we don't have a machine?" Su Xinjun asked back.
    "We have ten fingers, that's the machine! If we don't have an iron machine, we have to grind it out with these two hands!" He and everyone else grinded for ten days, and their hands grew large blisters. Some people complained and didn't want to grind anymore. Su Xinjun encouraged everyone and said: "In the beginning, when Comrade He Long made revolution, he also started empty-handed. He started with a kitchen knife and mobilized the people, and finally created a large revolutionary base. We also have to follow the path he took! Now everyone has blisters on their hands, and it hurts, that's true! But compared to the revolutionary martyrs making revolution, it's far worse! The blisters on everyone's hands are because their skills are not yet in place. In the future, the more solid the hands are grinded, the more calluses will grow, and blisters will no longer grow!" The workers continued to work with confidence after listening to him.
    At this time, two factory directors and engineers came from other factories. During the visit, they saw Su Xinjun leading a group of young people who had just put down their hoes, using the most primitive methods, to build a reverberatory furnace, and they couldn't help laughing.
    "You also want to build a reverberatory furnace, then what do you need engineers for?" the factory director said.
    "Yes," the engineer said coldly sarcastically. "You take technology too easily, too easily, right?"
    "Are you here specifically to discourage people?" Su Xinjun got angry.
    "Can't you say a few words of New Year's greetings?"
    The factory director and the engineer laughed even more: "If you can refine copper water, I will drink it!"
    Everyone was not discouraged at all. In a fit of pique, they simply moved the bedding next to the furnace, padded it with broken grass sacks, and dozed off there at night. They worked continuously for more than half a month, day and night, building and dismantling, dismantling and building again. They all grew big lice, and finally built a reverberatory furnace.
    After the first furnace was finished and melted into copper water, it began to come out of the furnace. When they chiseled open the furnace door, because the furnace door was too low, the copper water in the furnace suddenly poured out. The copper water splashed open and touched the standing water on the ground, bouncing and splashing everywhere, and a mist of water rose up in the room, obscuring the view. The young workers had no experience, and they panicked for a while. Some fled out the door, and some jumped out of the window, smashing the glass as well. Su Xinjun desperately shouted for them to come back in the room, wanting to rush to block the furnace door, but no one could hear him. When four or five tons of copper water flowed out, everyone came back.
    They refined the second furnace again. When it was about to come out of the furnace, Su Xinjun said to the workers:
    "Everyone must be calm and don't be afraid! However, the lives of our workers are priceless treasures. If there is danger, we must run away, don't fight to the death!" He immediately took "safety measures": he opened all the doors and windows as "escape doors". Who jumped out of that window and who walked through that door were clearly divided. He said: "As soon as I see something is wrong, shout: 'Run!' You run away quickly, be careful not to stumble."
    Fortunately, only half of the copper water ran out of the second furnace. The young workers did not panic at all. They came up with an idea overnight and worked all night, re-building the furnace door and making it higher so that the furnace could smoothly pour out the copper water. When the reverberatory furnace was continuously refining copper water, everyone couldn't help but think of the strange words said by the factory director and engineer from the other factory. After discussion, everyone decided to invite them to receive an "education." Along the way, the engineers were complacent. They walked into the workshop. Su Xinjun immediately hid behind the furnace. The workers rushed up and surrounded the two of them in front of the furnace. Opening the furnace door, the workers pointed to them to see the bright red, glowing copper water, boiling in the furnace and rising with fierce flames.
    "Someone, scoop up a spoonful of copper water and let them drink it!" a worker shouted loudly.
    "Yes, drink it... You have to keep your word, you have to drink it..."
    Su Xinjun came out from behind the furnace and said: "Last time, they wanted to drink copper water because they didn't know the copper water was hot! Don't let them drink it, if you want to drink it, wait until it's cool!" The workshop was filled with laughter.
    "He who laughs last laughs best." Let the story of the Benxi Alloy Factory end with the proud laughter of the working class! This factory has been appropriately called the "Hero Factory." (Attached picture)

　　无畏与奇迹
　　本报记者　徐家柱
    在煤铁之城本溪，有一座不满七百人的地方国营小工厂——本溪合金厂，最近有两万多个来自全国各地的参观者，在那里他们看到了一连串罕见的奇迹。
    这座工厂在1950年起家时，只有一口大锅、两把勺子、三个模子和四个不太懂技术的工人，今天已经自力更生地壮大成为我国有数的有色金属合金工厂。现在，它能够炼出铜、铅、铝、锡、镍等贵重合金共二百七十多种，成为我国一千二百多个重要企业不可缺少的助手。它生产的不少种合金，质量已达到了国际水平，运销到了朝鲜、越南、英国、新西兰、埃及、南非和东南亚各地。
    一种贵重的矽铝合金，在世界各国，都是用新式的电炉，或者精巧的小坩埚炼成的。本溪合金厂却从古老的八卦炉里炼出来。
    事情开始是这样的：青年工人刘万成在天津一家私营工厂里，看到一种炼铜用的八卦炉，这是中国古老的土炉子。他想，如果能把修建八卦炉的本领学回来，就可以用来试炼矽铝合金。他征得技师苏新军的同意，就一起到了天津一家私营工厂。
    那家私营工厂的资本家生怕本溪合金厂也修筑八卦炉用来炼铜，会敲掉他赚钱的买卖。他答应他们“参观”一下，可是提出了“约法三章”：一不准画图样，二不准照相，三不准走到八卦炉近旁，只准远远的站着看。
    苏新军和刘万成发了愁，他们商定了主意，决定不理会资本家的这套把戏。第二天，他们来到车间，发现有一座八卦炉已经停了火，准备检修。刘万成一打量，看见周围没有人，就想从炉门的加煤口，钻到炉膛里去。苏新军一摸炉子的外壁很烫，知道炉膛里可能会热得窒死人。他马上一把拉住刘万成的后襟，把刘万成从炉门口拖出来。
    “别拉住我。”刘万成说，“我钻进去量炉内的尺寸，你在外边记下来。”
    苏新军只好松开手。他站在外边，听到刘万成在炉膛里报尺寸，就记录下来。突然，他听见刘万成在炉膛里直喘了几声，就没有一点声音了。他一想不妙，马上钻进炉子，把烤得昏迷过去的刘万成拖了出来。刘万成一醒过来，就想钻进去。苏新军又一把拖住了他，自己却钻进了炉膛。两个人轮流着进进出出，边量边记。这时候，他们浑身上下都沾着煤屑，变成两个灰人儿了。车间主任看着他们，直摇头说：“我从来没有看见过，有人会钻进炉膛里去参观的！”
    他们从工人那里打听到，厂里有一位老瓦匠范师傅，是修建八卦炉的能手。他们想找到他，又怕资本家阻挡，就在厂门外守候着。范师傅下了班，一走出厂门，就被他们拦住了。范师傅正饿得慌，急忙想回家吃饭。他们费了好多口舌，才把范师傅拉进了小饭馆，大家喝着酒，谈得很投机。范师傅把八卦炉的“秘密”全部告诉了他们。
    两个人回到本溪，立刻带领工人参考八卦炉的筑法，修起了一座生产量超过八卦炉的十一卦炉。刘万成和工段长王怀顺商量，怎样在十一卦炉上炼矽铝合金。王怀顺也是复员军人，他原来只有初小毕业的文化程度，到合金厂后勤学苦钻，已经能看懂许多俄文原版的技术书籍，还翻译了一些技术资料。他根据技术理论，支持刘万成的创议。他们在夜班生产时，在十一卦炉上摸索，炼出了矽铝合金，然后才向厂部汇报。可是，有的工程师不知道合金已经试制出来，还以为只是一项建议，就引经据典，认为八卦炉和矽铝合金，这两个概念是无论如何不能联系起来的。
    这番“盖棺论定”的话刚刚说完，工人就把完全合格的矽铝合金，放在工程师的面前。这才使得工程师哑口无言，满面羞惭。
    去年，苏联冶金专家伊斯特林在合金厂，看到十一卦炉里炼出了矽铝合金，大为惊讶。他立刻询问这种土办法的创造者具有什么文化程度。
    “他们是山沟大学毕业的。”厂长笑着介绍说。
    伊斯特林一下听不懂，当他知道创造者过去都是山沟里的农民时，兴奋地说：“好，你们有志气！”
    本溪合金厂决定冶炼精铜。这个任务，又落在苏新军身上。冶炼精铜，必须修筑反射炉。可是，工厂没有一个会砌炉的瓦匠，没有一台磨砖的机器，没有一点修炉的经验。工厂仍决定大胆尝试。
    苏新军到劳动局去，挑选了十五个结实的小伙子，带回工厂，对他们说：
    “今天开始，我要教你们学习冶炼。我考一考你们，啥叫冶炼？”
    “不明白！”
    苏新军知道讲是讲不清楚的。第二天，他领着十五个年青人，到本溪钢铁公司去，看了高炉炼铁，又参观了人家用机器在磨耐火砖。
    “这就叫做冶炼。”苏新军告诉他们说。在现场结束了这堂“启蒙教育”，他立刻动员大家磨耐火砖，开始修建反射炉。
    “没有机器，怎么磨砖呢？”一个工人问道。
    “谁说我们没有机器？”苏新军反问道。
    “我们一个人有十个手指头，这就是机器！我们没有铁机器，就凭咱们这两只手也要磨出来！”他和大家一起磨了十天，手上都长出了一个个大血泡。有的人叫苦了，不愿意再磨下去了。苏新军鼓舞大家说：“当初，贺龙同志闹革命，也是赤手空拳的。他用菜刀起家，发动老百姓，到底打出了一大块红色革命根据地。咱们也要走他踏出来的路子！现在大伙儿手上磨出了大血泡，很痛，这不假！可是跟革命先烈闹革命比起来，还差得多呢！大伙儿手上磨出血泡，是因为功夫还没有到家。将来，两只手越磨越结实，磨出了大茧子，就不会再长出血泡了嘛！”工人们听了他的话，又信心百倍地干下去了。
    这时候，从其他工厂来了厂长和工程师两个人。他们在参观时，看到苏新军领着一批刚刚放下锄头的年青人，用最原始的办法，在修建反射炉，不禁哈哈大笑。
    “你们也想修反射炉，那还要工程师干什么呢？”厂长说。
    “是啊，”工程师冷冷地讽刺说。“你们把技术看得太简易，太容易了吧？”
    “你们是专门来给人泄气的？”苏军新发火了。
    “你们说几句拜年的话，不行吗？”
    厂长和工程师笑得更加厉害了：“你们能够炼出铜水，我就喝了它！”
    大家一点也不泄气。他们一赌气，索性把铺盖搬到炉子旁边，垫上破草袋，晚上就躺在那里打盹。他们连续半个多月，不分昼夜，砌了拆，拆了又砌。他们身上都生出了大虱子，最后砌成了反射炉。
    第一炉下完料，熔化成铜水，开始出炉了。他们一凿开炉门，因为炉门太低，炉内铜水猛的一下都倾泻出来。铜水洒开来，碰到地上的积水，四处乱蹦，乱溅，满屋子冒起水雾，对面不见人影。年青工人们没有经验，一时弄慌了，有的夺门而逃，有的跳出窗子，把玻璃也撞碎了。苏新军在屋子里拼命喊他们回来，想抢着把炉门堵住，可是谁也听不见。等到四、五吨铜水淌完了，人也都回来了。
    他们又炼了第二炉。快出炉的时候，苏新军对工人说：
    “大伙儿要沉着，别害怕！不过，咱们工人的生命是无价之宝。一有危险，该跑就得跑，别死拼！”他当场采取了“安全措施”：把所有的门窗都打开，当作“太平门”。谁跳那扇窗，谁走这扇门，都划分了清楚。他说：“我一看不妙。喝一声：‘跑！’你们拔脚就跑，当心别栽了跟斗。”
    总算还好，第二炉只跑掉一半铜水。年青工人一个也没有慌张。他们连夜想出主意，干了一整夜，重新改砌了炉门，把炉门修得高一点，使炉子顺利地淌出了铜水。当反射炉源源不断地炼出铜水的时候，大家不禁想起来外厂的厂长和工程师说过的怪话。大家商量结果，决定把他们请来，受一次“教育”。一路上，工程师洋洋得意，他们走进了车间。苏新军马上到炉子背后躲藏起来。工人们一拥而上，把他们两个人围住在炉子前。一打开炉门，工人指给他们看鲜红、发亮的铜水，正在炉子里沸腾着，冒起了炽烈的火焰。
    “来人哪，舀一勺铜水来，让他们喝下去！”一个工人大声喊道。
    “对，喝下去……说了话要算数，就得喝下去……”
    苏新军从炉子背后出来说：“上一回，他们想喝铜水，因为不知道铜水是烫的嘛！别让他们喝了，要喝，也等凉了再喝吧！”车间里响起了不息的笑声。
    “谁笑得最后，才笑得最好”。让本溪合金厂的故事，就在工人阶级自豪的笑声中结束吧！这座工厂已被人们确当地称呼为“英雄工厂”。（附图片）
