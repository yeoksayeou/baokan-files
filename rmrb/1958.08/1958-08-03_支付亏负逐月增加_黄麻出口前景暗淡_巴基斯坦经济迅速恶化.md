Xinhua News Agency report: Pakistan's economic situation continues to worsen. The evening paper "Leader" reported on July 31 that, according to preliminary statistics, Pakistan's payment deficit for May this year was 34.4 million rupees, an increase of 3.2 million rupees compared to the deficit of 31.2 million rupees in April. Total revenue for May was 129.2 million rupees, while expenditures reached 163.6 million rupees.

The newspaper said that the total payment deficit for the period from January to May has reached 108.5 million rupees.

"Leader" pointed out in an editorial: "The rapidly deteriorating economic situation of this country is alarming. The huge gap between our income and expenditure is widening day by day, and our recent situation in terms of payment deficits clearly brings about this dangerous situation."

According to a report by "Dawn" on the 1st, Martin, Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Jute Association, said that Pakistan is encountering a crisis in the foreign jute market, and the future may be even more bleak.

The newspaper said that in recent years, Pakistan's jute exports have been declining. Jute exports were 6 million bales in 1955-56, decreased to 4.8 million bales in 1956-57, and further decreased to 4.5 million bales in 1957-58. Since the demand for Pakistani jute in the foreign market is not improving in 1958-59, the prospects will be even more depressing.

According to a report by the Pakistan United Press, prices in Pakistan continue to rise sharply, with the prices of necessities and luxuries rising by 30% to 50% respectively.

    支付亏负逐月增加　黄麻出口前景暗淡
    巴基斯坦经济迅速恶化
    据新华社讯　巴基斯坦的经济状况继续恶化。晚报“领袖报”7月31日报道，根据初步统计，巴基斯坦今年5月份的支付亏负为三千四百四十万卢比，比4月份的亏负三千一百二十万卢比增加了三百二十万卢比。5月份的收入总额为一亿二千九百二十万卢比，而支出达一亿六千三百六十万卢比。
    这家报纸说，从1月到5月这个期间的支付总亏负已达一亿零八百五十万卢比。
    “领袖报”在社论中指出：“这个国家的迅速恶化的经济状况是惊人的。我们的收入和支出之间的巨大距离正在日益扩大，我们最近在支付亏负方面的情况非常明显地带来了这种危险的局面。”
    据“黎明报”1日报道，巴基斯坦黄麻协会副主席马丁说，巴基斯坦在国外的黄麻市场遇到了危机，前途可能还要更加暗淡。
    这家报纸说，近几年来，巴基斯坦黄麻出口情况一直在走下坡路。1955—56年黄麻出口为六百万包，1956—57年下降到四百八十万包，1957—58年又降到四百五十万包。由于1958—59年国外市场对巴基斯坦黄麻的需求不见好转，前景将更令人沮丧。
    据巴基斯坦统一通讯社报道，巴基斯坦的物价继续猛烈上涨，必需品和奢侈品的价格分别上涨了30％到50％。
