    Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister De Gaulle presented an anti-democratic new draft constitution to the newly established so-called "Constitutional Consultative Committee" on the 29th, attempting to use it to replace the current constitution formulated in 1946 with the participation of French progressive forces, thereby establishing his personal dictatorship.
    The so-called "Constitutional Consultative Committee," which was also announced on the same day, has thirty-nine members, two-thirds of whom were elected by the two houses of parliament, and one-third of whom were appointed by the government. The well-known right-wing politician Paul Reynaud was elected as the chairman of the committee. Prior to this, the French Communist Party had already announced its refusal to participate in this committee. This committee will have the right to offer opinions on the new draft constitution, but the government is under no obligation to consider these opinions.
    The clauses of the new draft constitution fully expose De Gaulle's conspiracy to seize dictatorial power. The new draft constitution stipulates that the president will have unlimited power: he will have the power to appoint the prime minister and consult with him on the list of other cabinet members; he will play an "arbitration" role between the cabinet and the parliament, and when there is a serious disagreement between the government and the parliament, he will have the power to dissolve the parliament; he will have the power to promulgate laws and can submit these bills to "national referendum" bypassing the parliament; he not only has the power to approve international treaties, but also has the power to negotiate and sign such treaties; in the event of a "state of emergency," he also has the power to take over the government. The new constitution does not provide any restrictions or supervision on the president's absolute power. In addition, the current constitution stipulates that the president is elected by members of the two houses of parliament, while the new draft constitution expands the people participating in the election of the president to include parliamentary representatives from various provinces, cities, and overseas territories in order to ensure that the right-wing reactionary forces can manipulate the election of the president.
    On the other hand, the new draft constitution tries its best to restrict and weaken the power of the National Assembly, the representative body elected by universal suffrage. It stipulates that the legislative power of the parliament is limited to the enactment of laws "involving major issues," while the legislative power relating to other specific issues, and even the legislative power relating to major issues such as the electoral system, will be transferred to the government; the annual meeting time of the National Assembly will be reduced to a maximum of only five and a half months, instead of at least seven months as stipulated in the current constitution; more importantly, this new draft constitution also stipulates that a motion of no confidence in the government by the parliament must be supported by an absolute majority vote (i.e., half plus one vote) to be passed, and all members of parliament who abstain from voting will be deemed to support the government. According to these provisions, the role of the National Assembly is actually reduced to an expendable degree, so that the government is completely free from the constraints of the parliament. At the same time, De Gaulle has long conspired to further deprive Communist and progressive members of parliament of their seats by amending the electoral law after the constitution is amended, so that the parliament becomes his docile tool.
    Regarding the relationship between France and its overseas territories, the new draft constitution only vaguely mentions that these overseas territories should form a so-called "Federation" with France. No clear provision is made for the future status of Algeria, but from the provision in the draft that there will be seventy Algerian parliamentarians in the National Assembly, it is not difficult to see that the so-called "integration" colonial policy will actually be implemented in Algeria.
    According to De Gaulle's plan, this new draft constitution will be submitted to a "national referendum" for approval in early October. It is reported that the right-wing forces are preparing to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign starting in early September in order to deceive as many people as possible into supporting the new constitution. Once the new constitution is adopted, De Gaulle will succeed Coty as president.

    This newspaper's comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency: The so-called draft constitution put forward by the De Gaulle government has not only been strongly opposed by progressive forces in France, but has also aroused dissatisfaction among some people in the bourgeois "moderate" faction.
    French Communist Party members held a meeting in the National Assembly on the 30th under the chairmanship of Jacques Duclos. The Communist Party parliamentary group called on all Republicans to step up their propaganda work against the referendum, urging millions of people to express a negative attitude on October 5th, blocking the road to De Gaulle's dictatorship and fascism.
    The Communist Party members pointed out that it is extremely necessary and urgent to convene the National Assembly, because the policies implemented by De Gaulle not only endanger peace, but also lead to rising living expenses and worsen the living conditions of the working people due to a series of economic and social measures. The French Communist Party parliamentary group calls on Republicans to rise up and put pressure on their members of parliament to promote the convening of the National Assembly and stop the policies of De Gaulle, because this policy is to intensify the Algerian war and lead the French people to the brink of adventure in the Middle East; at the same time, this policy also destroys the Republic through his draft constitution and deepens the poverty of the workers.
    The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" published an editorial pointing out that the publication of the draft constitution has played a clarifying role, which will inevitably make those who may still harbor some illusions about "His Majesty's Republicanism" to make some useful reflections. De Gaulle's constitution gives the president of the republic dictatorial powers while depriving the basic rights of the people's representatives, which is reminiscent of the constitution imposed by Prince President Napoleon (1851) with guns on December 2.
    The French Anti-Fascist Committee passed a resolution on the referendum scheduled for October 5, pointing out that this referendum does not have the nature of democratic consultation at all, and called for launching a strong movement to strive for a negative attitude in the referendum.
    Many members of the Socialist Party parliamentary groups of the French National Assembly and the Republic's Senate oppose the new draft constitution recently announced by De Gaulle. These members of parliament mainly include: Gazier, Le Renard, Jules Moch, Mérigonde, Goutard, and Notebart.
    They particularly oppose the following provisions in the new draft constitution: the president actually decides alone to prohibit members of parliament from holding ministerial positions concurrently, and decides alone on the issue of parliamentary immunity. At the same time, they also strongly oppose the establishment of a constitutional court, because this court will have the power to veto the parliament, and its members, who serve a ten-year term, are not elected but appointed.
    Some members of the People's Republican Party parliamentary group also take a reserved attitude towards reducing the power of the National Assembly and giving the president unlimited power. They also expressed dissatisfaction with Paul Reynaud's hasty election as chairman of the Constitutional Consultative Committee.
    Detraz, general secretary of the Catholic Labor League Construction Industry Union Federation, expressed concern about the constitution that stipulates that individuals have exclusive power. He is in favor of voting against the draft constitution.
    Some bourgeois newspapers in Paris also expressed dissatisfaction with the new draft constitution. "Le Figaro" commented: "We are no longer acting according to republican tradition." The newspaper also wrote: "It seems unacceptable to give the head of the administration such arbitrary power without restraint, which will violate more than a hundred years of liberal tradition." "L'Aurore" also said that obviously, the future of the system will depend on the character and personality of the president and prime minister of the republic. "Le Monde" said: People's reaction to the draft constitution ranges from taking a reserved attitude to expressing disappointment.
    Among those who take a reserved attitude are Paul Bastid, a member of the Constitutional Council and professor of civil law. They are not yet willing to express a final attitude, but they cannot fail to notice that the functions of the parliament are arbitrarily restricted, while the legislative powers granted to the government are too broad.
    Even the right-wing newspaper "Paris Presse" uneasily pointed out that from now on, the functions of the parliament will be greatly reduced, and therefore does not shy away from saying that according to the government's draft constitution, the parliament has become a representative body composed of dignitaries without power.

### 法共号召人民堵塞独裁道路  用实际行动反对戴高乐的反民主宪法草案

    法共号召人民堵塞独裁道路
    用实际行动反对戴高乐的反民主宪法草案
    据新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理戴高乐29日向新成立的所谓“宪法咨询委员会”提出了反民主的新宪法草案，企图用它来代替在1946年由法国进步力量参与制订的现行宪法，从而建立他的个人独裁。
    这个在同一天宣告成立的所谓“宪法咨询委员会”共有三十九名委员，其中三分之二由议会两院推选，三分之一是由政府指定的。著名的右翼政客保罗·雷诺当选为委员会的主席。在此以前，法国共产党已经宣布拒绝参加这个委员会。这个委员会将有权对新宪法草案提出意见，但是政府没有义务非考虑这些意见不可。
    新宪法草案的条款充分暴露了戴高乐企图攫取独裁大权的阴谋。新宪法草案规定，总统将拥有无限大权：他将有权任命总理并且同他商定内阁其他成员的名单；他将在内阁和议会之间起“仲裁”作用，当政府和议会双方发生严重分歧时，他有权解散议会；他有权颁布法律，并且可以越过议会把这些法案提交“全民表决”；他不仅有权批准国际条约，而且有权谈判签订这类条约；在国家处在“紧急状态”时，他还有权接管政府。新宪法没有规定对总统这种绝对权力给予任何约束或监督。另外，现行宪法规定由议会两院议员来选举总统，新宪法草案则把参加选举总统的人扩大到包括各省市和海外属地的议会代表，以便保证右翼反动势力能够操纵总统的选举。
    另一方面，新宪法草案竭力限制和削弱由普选产生的代议机构国民议会的权力。它规定把议会的立法权限于制订“涉及主要问题”的法律，而其余涉及各项具体问题的立法权，甚至像有关选举制度这样重大问题的立法权则将转到政府手里；国民议会每年的开会时间将缩减到最多只有五个半月，而不是像现行宪法所规定的那样至少开会七个月；更重要的是，这个新宪法草案还规定：议会对政府的不信任案必须有绝对多数票（即一半加一票）支持才算通过，而凡是投弃权票的议员将一律被认为是支持政府的。按照这些规定，实际上就是把国民议会的作用降低到可有可无的程度，使政府完全摆脱议会的约束。同时，戴高乐早已阴谋在宪法修改以后通过修改选举法来达到进一步剥夺共产党议员和进步议员席位的目的，从而使议会成为他的驯服的工具。
    关于法国同它的海外属地的关系，新宪法草案只笼统地谈到要这些海外属地同法国成立所谓“联合邦”。对阿尔及利亚的未来地位没有作出明确规定，但是从草案中关于国民议会中将有七十名阿尔及利亚议员的规定这一点，就不难看出对阿尔及利亚实际上将推行所谓“合为一体”的殖民主义政策。
    按照戴高乐的计划，这个新宪法草案将在10月初提交给“全民投票”表决。有消息说，右翼势力准备从9月初开始发动大规模的宣传活动，以便哄骗尽量多的人来支持新宪法。一旦新宪法被采纳，戴高乐将继戈蒂出任总统。
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：戴高乐政府提出的所谓宪法草案，在法国国内不仅受到进步力量的严正反对，而且还引起了资产阶级“温和派”中一部分人的不满。
    法国共产党议员30日在雅克·杜克洛的主持下在国民议会举行了会议。共产党议会党团号召所有共和人士加紧进行反对全民投票的宣传鼓动工作，促使千百万人民在10月5日表示否定态度，堵塞戴高乐独裁和法西斯主义的道路。
    共产党议员们指出，召开国民议会是极其必要而迫切的，因为戴高乐所执行的政策不但使和平处于危险之中，而且由于采取了一系列的经济和社会措施，造成了生活费用的高涨并且使得劳动人民的生活条件每况愈下。法国共产党议会党团要求共和人士起来对自己的议员们施加压力，促成国民议会的召开，制止奉行戴高乐的政策。因为这个政策是加紧进行阿尔及利亚战争，把法国人民导向在中东进行冒险的边缘；同时这种政策还通过他的宪法草案来摧毁共和国，并加深劳动者的贫困处境。
    法国共产党机关报“人道报”发表社论指出，宪法草案的公布起了澄清的作用，从而势将使得那些可能仍然对“国王陛下的共和主义”还抱着一些幻想的人们作一番有益的思考。戴高乐宪法赋予共和国总统以独裁的权力，同时剥夺人民代表的基本权利，这就使人想起拿破仑亲王总统（1851年）12月2日用枪杆子强加于人的那部宪法。
    法国反法西斯委员会就定在10月5日举行的全民投票通过一项决议，指出这次全民投票丝毫不具有民主征求意见的性质，并且号召展开一个争取在全民投票时采取否定态度的强有力的运动。
    法国国民议会和共和国参议院的社会党议会党团内不少成员反对戴高乐刚刚公布的新宪法草案。这些议员中主要包括：加齐埃、勒纳尔、儒勒·莫克、梅里贡德、古当和诺特巴。
    他们特别反对新宪法草案中的下面这些规定：总统实际上得独自决定禁止议员兼任部长、独自决定议员豁免权问题。同时他们也竭力反对成立宪法法院，因为这个法院将有权对议会行使否决权，而它的任期十年的成员不是选举产生而是被任命的。
    人民共和党议会党团的部分成员也对削减国民议会的权力和给予总统以无限大权采取保留态度。他们并且对保罗·雷诺仓促地当选宪法谘询委员会主席表示不满。
    天主教劳工联盟建筑业工会联合会总书记戴特拉兹对于规定个人独揽大权的宪法表示不安。他赞成对宪法草案投否决票。
    巴黎一些资产阶级报纸也对新宪法草案表示不满。“费加罗报”评论说：“我们现在已经不再按照共和传统办事了。”这家报纸还写道：“给予行政首脑以这样任意行事的权力而不加以制约，这似乎是难以接受的，这将违反一百多年来的自由主义传统。”“震旦报”也说，显然，制度的前途将取决共和国总统和总理的为人和个性。“世界报”说：人们对宪法草案的反应，是从采取保留态度到表示失望。
    在采取保留态度的人们中间，有宪法委员会委员、民法教授保罗·巴斯迪。他们还不愿意表示最后的态度，但是他们也不能不注意到：议会的职能受到了专横的限制，而赋与政府的立法权力则过于广泛。
    连右翼报纸“巴黎新闻报”也不安地指出，从今以后，议会的职能将被大大削减，因此并不讳言，按照政府宪法草案的规定，议会变成了没有权力的显贵人物组成的代议机构。（附图片）
