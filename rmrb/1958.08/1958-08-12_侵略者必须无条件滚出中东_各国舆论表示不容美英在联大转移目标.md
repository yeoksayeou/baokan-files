Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Public opinion in various countries continues to demand that the UN General Assembly Emergency Session force the US and British aggressors to withdraw their troops from the Middle East, opposing the US and UK's conspiracies and tricks to divert attention.

A commentator from Cairo Radio said on the evening of the 9th that people all over the world are closely watching the United Nations General Assembly and demanding that the General Assembly fulfill its responsibilities and force the aggressors to withdraw from the Middle East unconditionally.

The commentator said that the withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East is the main condition for maintaining peace in the region.

The commentator said: Any attempt to submerge the urgent demand for the withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East in a sea of other issues will have unimaginable consequences, not only for the role of the United Nations, but also for its very existence and the peace it is responsible for safeguarding.

Cairo newspapers unanimously pointed out that the UN General Assembly's urgent obligation is to resolve the issue of the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The "People's Newspaper" editorial wrote that, in fact, there is only one question before the United Nations General Assembly now, and that is the issue of Anglo-American aggression against Jordan and Lebanon. There is only one solution to this problem, and that is the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops and the non-interference of Western countries in the internal affairs of the Arab countries.

The Iraqi "Freedom Daily" criticized the conspiracies of imperialism and its servants in the United Nations, and pointed out that socialist countries will safeguard the interests of Arab countries in the United Nations. We must make every effort to resolve the main issue: the unconditional withdrawal of aggressive troops from Arab territories.

Japanese newspapers welcomed the Security Council's decision to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the situation in the Near East and hoped that the meeting could find a way to resolve the crisis in the Arab East.

The "Asahi Shimbun" editorial wrote that in order to solve the problems caused by the US and British military intervention in the Middle East, the meeting should accomplish two tasks: fiercely criticize the United States and the United Kingdom for sending troops to the Middle East and causing a crisis there; force the United States and Britain to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" accused the United States and the United Kingdom of continuing to send reinforcements to Lebanon and Jordan, saying that this action undermined the United Nations' efforts to resolve the Middle East issue.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" welcomed the convening of the meeting, writing: "The member states of the United Nations should remember that as long as the Arab countries do not feel that their independence is guaranteed, the Middle East problem cannot be fundamentally resolved."

The Thai "Daily Mail" published an editorial on the 8th stating that the Soviet Union's proposal to the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to withdraw US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan is of great significance for maintaining world peace.

The "Picture News" published an article on the 8th saying that US and British imperialism must immediately withdraw their troops from the Middle East, and the vast number of peace-loving and just Thai people condemn the interference of US and British imperialism in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th: The Cairo "People's Newspaper" believes today that the United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's proposal to the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to resolve the Middle East crisis "caused unpleasant surprise and disappointment to the Arabs."

The newspaper pointed out that Hammarskjöld almost suggested establishing international forces to be stationed along the borders of Lebanon, and he even repeated the United States' accusations against some Arab countries when demanding that Arab countries not interfere in each other's internal affairs.
