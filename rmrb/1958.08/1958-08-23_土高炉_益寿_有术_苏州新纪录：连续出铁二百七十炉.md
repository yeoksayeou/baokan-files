Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 21st: The 0.18 cubic meter earthen blast furnace of the Suzhou Minfeng Boiler Factory, since it was ignited on July 26th, had continuously produced 270 heats by August 14th, tapping over 8,000 catties of iron, with a peak daily output of 746 catties, setting a new record for earthen blast furnace iron tapping. This fact demonstrates that earthen blast furnaces can indeed "live long" and produce a continuous flow of iron.

Why can this type of furnace "live long"? Workers say: Besides paying attention to the angles of the air inlet, iron tapping hole, and slag outlet when building the furnace, mastering the operation is a crucial key. They have explored five operational experiences: (1) The speed of the blower should be around 2,800 revolutions per minute. If the wind force is insufficient, the furnace will freeze. (2) The drying and moistening of the furnace itself must be well controlled. Newly built furnaces generally need to be baked for more than ten hours, and repaired furnaces also need to be baked for about five hours. Do not rush to ignite them. (3) Prevent man-made freezing and master the operation (charging, watching the furnace temperature). When starting the furnace, first fill it with charcoal, take advantage of the remaining heat from baking the furnace to start the blower and burn the charcoal. After 40% of the charcoal is burned, start adding materials. Add fuel (white coal or coke) first, then five catties of slag and fifteen catties of fuel. Do not add ore for the first three times. Because slag is easy to melt into liquid, increasing the fire power in the furnace. After adding slag three times, start officially charging ore. (4) When charging, make sure it is even on all four sides, and do not pile it up. The proportion of fuel and ore in each charge must not be mistaken. Before charging, first check whether the fire power in the furnace has reached its peak (the method of checking is to see if the fire color in the wind pipe is white). If the fire power has not reached its peak, some fuel should be added first, and less ore should be added. When removing slag, also pay attention to the fluidity of the slag and the color of the molten iron in the furnace. If it is found that the fluidity of the slag is not strong and the fire color in the furnace turns yellow or red, it proves that the temperature in the furnace is decreasing, and the proportion of ore in the charge must be quickly reduced to increase the furnace temperature. (5) The slag must be removed cleanly, the air inlet pipe must be kept clean, and the wind force must be normal.

### 土高炉“益寿”有术  苏州新纪录：连续出铁二百七十炉

　　土高炉“益寿”有术
    苏州新纪录：连续出铁二百七十炉
    新华社南京21日电　苏州市民丰锅厂○·一八立方公尺的土高炉，自7月26日点火以来，到8月14日已连续生产二百七十炉，出铁八千多斤，日产量最高达到七百四十六斤，创造了土高炉出铁的新纪录。这一事实，说明土高炉是能够“延年益寿”，铁水长流的。
    为什么这种炉子能够长寿呢？工人说：除了建炉时要注意进风口、出铁口、出渣口的角度以外，掌握操作是个重要的关键问题。他们在操作上摸索了五条经验：（1）鼓风机的转速每分钟要在二千八百转左右，如果风力不足，炉子就要发生冻结。（2）炉子本身的干潮要掌握好，新建炉子一般要烘十小时以上，炉子修理也要烘五小时左右，不能急于点火。（3）防止人为的冻结，掌握好操作（加料、看炉温），在初开炉的时候，要先加满木炭，趁烘炉的余火开风烧木炭，等木炭烧去40％后，开始加料。加料时先加燃料（白煤或焦炭），后加五斤矿渣，十五斤燃料。开头三次，不加矿石。因矿渣容易熔成液体，增加炉内火力，加过三次矿渣后，就开始正式投矿石。（4）加料时要做到四面均匀，不可以堆在一起。一次燃料和一次矿石搭配好的比例，不能弄错。在投料前，要先检查一下炉内火力是否达到旺点（检查办法是看风管内火色是否发白了），如果火力还没达到旺点，应该先加些燃料，少加矿石；在出渣时也应该注意渣的流动性和炉内铁水颜色，如果发现渣的流动性不强和炉内火色转黄或红，那证明炉内温度在降低，必须迅速将投料中的矿石比重减低，以提高炉温。（5）出渣要出得清，进风管要保持干净，风力要正常。
