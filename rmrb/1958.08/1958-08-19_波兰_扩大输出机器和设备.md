　　·Poland·
　　Expanding Exports of Machinery and Equipment
　　Poland's total exports of machinery and complete sets of equipment this year are expected to reach 1 billion rubles, accounting for 25% of total exports. Before the war, Poland was an exporter of agricultural products, and the total value of machinery and equipment exports was less than 1%.
　　During the era of the people's government, the rapidly developing Polish machine manufacturing industry has continuously increased the export volume of machinery and equipment. In 1956, Polish exports of machinery and equipment accounted for 15.6% of total exports, increasing to 20.7% in 1957. Compared with 1955, the total value of complete industrial equipment exported by Poland in 1957 increased more than seven times.
　　Poland now exports machinery and equipment to sixty countries around the world. The exported machinery and equipment include: coal industry equipment, metallurgical industry equipment, machine tools, sugar factory equipment, power equipment, and light industry and food industry equipment. In recent years, Poland's exports of machinery and equipment to Asian, African, and Latin American countries have increased significantly.

    ·波兰·
　　扩大输出机器和设备
    波兰今年出口的机器和成套设备的总值预计将达到十亿卢布，即占全部出口总值的25％，而战前波兰是个农产品输出国，机器设备的出口总值还不到1％。
    在人民政权年代中，迅速发展的波兰机器制造业使机器设备的出口量不断增长。在1956年波兰出口的机器设备已经占全部出口总值的15.6％，到1957年增加到了20.7％。同1955年相比，1957年波兰出口的成套工业装备总值增加到了七倍以上。
    现在波兰已经向世界上六十个国家输出机器和设备。出口的机器设备包括：煤炭工业装备、冶金工业设备、工作母机、制糖厂设备、电力设备和轻工业、食品工业设备等。近年来，波兰向亚非国家和拉丁美洲国家输出的机器设备显著地增加了。
