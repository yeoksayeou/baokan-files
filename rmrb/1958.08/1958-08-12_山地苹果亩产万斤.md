　　Mountain Apple Yields 10,000 Jin Per Mu
    Although the apples of the Guangming Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Weihai City, Shandong Province, are planted on mountain slopes with gradients of seven to twenty degrees and the soil layer is only seven or eight inches deep, the yield per unit area is surprisingly high. This cooperative has 1.3 mu of high-yield orchard producing 14,020 jin of fruit, averaging 10,777 jin per mu, which is eight times higher than the national average.
    In order to grow good apples, this agricultural cooperative not only repaired terraced fields and dug water storage pits, but also opened mountains and split rocks to divert water up the mountain.
    In order to increase yields, they applied 7,000 jin of human manure and urine, over 200 jin of plant ash, and 180 jin of chemical fertilizers per mu in the orchard. The cooperative is also very particular about fertilization methods, planting density, alignment, pruning, and spraying to prevent and control diseases and insect pests.

　　山地苹果亩产万斤
    山东威海市郊光明生产合作社的苹果虽然栽在七到二十度的山坡上，土层只有七、八寸深，但是单位产量却高得出奇。这个社有一点三亩丰产园产果一万四千零二十斤，每亩平均一万零七百七十七斤，比全国平均产量高八倍。
    这个农业社，为了种好苹果，不但整修了梯田，挖了贮水坑，而且开山劈石，引水上山。
    为了提高产量，他们在果园里，每亩施人屎尿等七千斤，草木灰二百多斤和一百八十多斤化学肥料。这个社在施肥方法、种植密度、整行、修剪和打药防治病虫等方面，也都很讲究。
