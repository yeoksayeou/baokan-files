Accumulate Fertilizer Quickly, Efficiently and Economically
    Tian Lianqian

Any work requires attention to methodology. Good methods can quickly achieve good results; poor methods waste effort and are inefficient.

We will discuss the issue of accumulating and creating fertilizer here, which is a labor-intensive task in rural areas. The methods for this work, it seems today, can be greatly improved.

Currently, besides the production of soil-based fertilizer, farmers' methods for accumulating and creating fertilizer are basically as follows:

One is the traditional method. This method, suited to the characteristics of a scattered small-scale agricultural economy, is still widely used. This involves making the farmer's residence the center of activities for accumulating and creating fertilizer. Collected manure is piled up in the village; accumulated miscellaneous fertilizer and plant ash are piled up in the village; pigsties and sheepfolds are also located in the village. This is something everyone is used to. People think it is very convenient: for example, it is easy to calculate the amount of fertilizer accumulated and created; centralized fertilizer is easier to manage than dispersed fertilizer; and there are places to pile it up in front of and behind the village, etc. However, it is very inconvenient when it comes to using the fertilizer, requiring the organization of a large amount of manpower to transport it to the fields. This contradiction was already prominent in the spring ploughing preparation work this year. At that time, the large-scale water conservancy projects mobilized a lot of labor, and coupled with the accumulation and transportation of fertilizer, it was simply overwhelming. The main reason for this is the fertilizer accumulation method centered on the place of residence.

The other method of accumulating and creating fertilizer is the innovative method. The characteristic of this method is that it makes the work of accumulating and creating fertilizer fully adapted to the production needs of a large-scale collective agricultural economy, accumulating and creating fertilizer directly in the fields rather than in the villages. This is a new development in the methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer in the midst of the rural production upsurge. In order to realize the great leap forward in agricultural production, the attention of the broad masses of farmers is focused on how to do a good job in production, on how to rationally arrange labor and overcome labor shortages. Therefore, the issue of rationally and scientifically using fertilizer, as well as the method of accumulating and creating fertilizer adapted to the method of using fertilizer, has been put on the agenda. Following this, we have seen some new creations. For example, the news from Xushui County published in this newspaper on the 6th illustrates this point. Xushui County, Hebei Province, broke the old conventions of pig raising and moved the pigsties from the villages to the thinner soil farther from the villages, implementing pig raising and fertilizer accumulation in the fields. It is estimated that the county will increase its grain production by 50 million jin per year due to the improvement of the soil, and the labor saved from transporting fertilizer before the autumn planting will reach 240,000, thus alleviating the contradiction between production and labor shortage to a considerable extent. This is really a good thing.

The situation has changed, and the methods must also change accordingly. The small-scale agricultural economy has become a collective economy, and the methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer should also be different. The methods of creating and accumulating fertilizer that were once suitable for the small-scale agricultural economy are no longer suitable today; they are slow, inefficient, and wasteful. We need new methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer that are suitable for large-scale production, that are faster, better, and more economical, like those created in Xushui and many other places. The task of accumulating fertilizer this summer and autumn is far greater than in any previous year, and many regions are planning to apply tens of thousands of jin of manure per mu or more. If we want to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer with insufficient labor and transport it to the fields in a timely manner, we can no longer follow the old methods, but must adopt new methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer directly in the fields, adapting to local conditions as much as possible.

Making fertilizer in the fields and using it on the spot is not a new or unusual thing. Many regions already have it. For example, most farmers in Hunan make ditch fertilizer in the fields, and the methods of digging cellars to rot green manure and make pond fertilizer in Shitou Town, Pucheng County, Fujian Province, are all examples. The key question is how leaders in various localities discover these advanced methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer from the masses and quickly summarize and promote them. Only in this way can we better complete this year's task of accumulating fertilizer.

    积肥要多快好省
    田连阡
    任何工作都要讲究工作方法。好的方法可以迅速收到好的效果；不好的方法却使人耗费力气，事倍功半。
    我们在这里谈谈积肥造肥问题，这是农村里面花费劳动力很大的一项工作；这个工作的方法今天看来大可讲究。
    现在，各地除了制土化肥以外，农家积肥造肥方法基本上有以下两种：
    一种是传统的方法。这种适合分散的小农经济特点的方法还被普遍使用着，这就是以农民居住的处所为积肥造肥的活动中心。拾来的粪，堆在村子里；积的杂肥、草木灰，堆在村子里；猪圈羊圈也都设置在村子里，这已经是人人习惯的事了。人们以为这样挺便当：比如便于计算积肥造肥数量；肥料集中也比分散容易管理；村前村后也有堆放场所等等。但是，到用肥的时候却十分不便，需要组织大量人力往田里赶运。这个矛盾在今春备耕工作中就已经突出表现出来；那时大修水利调动了不少劳动力，再加上积肥运肥，简直就使人忙得难于透口气。其所以如此，大半由于以居处场所为中心的积肥方法所造成。
    另一种积肥造肥方法是革新的方法。这种方法的特点就是使积肥造肥工作完全适应大规模集体农业经济的生产需要，不在村子里头而是直接在田间地头积肥造肥。这是农村处在生产高潮中积肥造肥方法的新发展。为了实现农业生产的大跃进，广大农民的注意力都集中在怎样搞好生产上面，集中在怎样合理安排劳动力、克服劳力不足上面。所以，合理地科学地使用肥料，以及与用肥方法相适应的积肥造肥方法问题就被提到日程上来。跟着我们就看到了一些新创造。例如本报6日发表的徐水县消息就说明这点。河北徐水县打破养猪陈规陋矩，把猪圈从村子里搬到离村较远、土质瘠薄的土地上，实行在田间养猪积肥。预计全县因土壤得到改良而增产的粮食一年有五千万斤，而在秋种前从运肥当中节省出来的劳力即达二十四万个，生产和劳力不足的矛盾从此得到相当程度的缓和，这实在是一件很好的事。
    情况变了，方法也要随着变。小农经济变成了集体经济，积肥造肥的方法也应有所不同。曾经适合小农经济的造肥积肥方法，在今天就不适用了，就是少慢差费的方法了；我们需要像徐水及其他许多地方创造的适合大规模生产的新的多快好省的积肥造肥的方法。今年夏秋积肥任务远比过去任何一年为大，许多地区都计划每亩上粪几万斤或者更多。我们要在劳动力不足的情况下积造大量的肥，并要作到及时运到田间，就再不能沿用旧方法，而必须尽可能地采用因土制宜、田间地头直接积肥造肥的新方法。
    田头制肥，就地使用，并不算如何新奇的事，好些地区都已有了。例如湖南农民大多会在田里制氹肥，福建浦城县石陂镇在田头打窖沤绿肥、制塘肥的办法都是。关键问题在于各地领导如何从群众中发现这类先进的积肥造肥方法，把它迅速总结推广。只有这样才能更好地完成今年的积肥任务。
