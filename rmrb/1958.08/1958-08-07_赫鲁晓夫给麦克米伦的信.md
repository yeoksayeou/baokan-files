Khrushchev's Letter to Prime Minister Macmillan:

On July 31, I received your reply to my letter of July 28 concerning the current situation in the Middle East.

In previous letters from the Soviet government, we used the facts we possess to prove that the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan has created a situation in the Middle East that endangers peace. Therefore, your assertion in your letter of July 31 that the Soviet government's assessment of the actions of the British and American governments is unfounded is completely contrary to the actual situation.

Prime Minister, you stated in your letter of July 31 that you still adhere to the position you stated in your letter of July 22 regarding the issue of convening a summit meeting to discuss the Middle East situation, and you also said that you seem never to have departed from this position. However, we cannot agree with this statement because what you suggested in your letter of July 26 and what you are suggesting now both indicate a rejection of the summit meeting previously supported by the British government.

Now you advocate convening a Security Council meeting instead of a summit meeting to discuss the above-mentioned issue. However, the whole world knows that the Security Council, which has been discussing the situation in Lebanon and Jordan for a long time, has not been able to adopt effective measures to resolve this problem until now.

The attempts by the U.S. and British governments to steer the discussion of the Middle East situation into a track of fruitless debate are particularly evident in Mr. Eisenhower's letter of August 1 to me. In this letter, the U.S. President explicitly advocates discussing this issue in a regular session of the Security Council.

As for the "not entirely formal" summit meeting you referred to, it is clear from Mr. Eisenhower's above-mentioned letter that the U.S. government does not consider the possibility of holding a summit meeting outside the regular session procedure of the Security Council at all. However, everyone knows that under the current circumstances, the majority of the members of the Security Council are countries participating in the aggressive bloc, and the great People's Republic of China is not represented. Of course, this body cannot draw objective conclusions on the issue of foreign armed intervention in Arab Eastern countries.

Since the beginning of the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East, the Soviet Union has advocated taking urgent measures to stop the aggression, withdraw foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan, prevent the expansion of armed intervention, and eliminate the dangerous tension caused by the actions of Britain and the United States. For these purposes, the Soviet government suggested convening a summit meeting of the governments of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, and India with the participation of the UN Secretary-General. We regret that you and the U.S. President do not consider this proposal acceptable and continue to advocate discussing the Middle East situation in the UN Security Council, which cannot objectively resolve this issue. Thus, the issue of convening a five-nation summit meeting with the participation of the UN Secretary-General has not been properly resolved.

Although the British and U.S. governments have made it impossible to convene a five-nation conference and should bear direct responsibility for this, it can now be clearly determined that the demand of the people of all countries for the immediate convening of such a meeting to stop armed intervention in Jordan and Lebanon, as well as the determination of peace-loving countries to stop aggression in the Middle East, have forced the initiators of armed intervention to abandon their plans to expand the aggression to other countries, primarily the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic, during this period. Therefore, it is no accident that Western countries, including Britain and the United States, have had to recognize the Republic of Iraq. Initially, the aggressors described the birth of the Republic of Iraq as a threat to peace in the Middle East. However, this does not mean that the danger of the conflict in the region expanding and intensifying has been eliminated, and the security of the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries is guaranteed. The interventionist forces have not yet withdrawn from Jordan and Lebanon. In addition, new foreign troops are still constantly entering the region, and the Baghdad Pact countries are implementing new military measures.

The issue of completely stopping armed intervention in the Middle East and establishing conditions there that would allow the people of all countries in the region to be free from foreign intervention remains an urgent issue to be resolved. Foreign troops must immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, because their presence there is a constant threat to peace and the independence of all countries, and an intolerable violation of the UN Charter, which no UN member state can allow.

Under these circumstances, the Soviet government believes that it must strive to maintain and consolidate peace in the Middle East. Since the British and U.S. governments have refused to convene a five-nation summit meeting, and the Security Council, as we have already pointed out, cannot guarantee a resolution of the Middle East situation in favor of peace, the Soviet government, in order to take necessary measures quickly to stop the aggression, has instructed its representative to the United Nations to request the convening of an emergency session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan and U.S. troops from Lebanon. The Soviet government hopes that the discussion of this issue by the UN General Assembly, with the participation of representatives from both large and small countries, will find a way to eliminate the danger of war caused by the actions of Britain and the United States in the Middle East and bring peace to the region.

Prime Minister, the events in the Middle East have put the world on the brink of a total war, which would bring countless disasters to the people of all countries. In view of this situation in the Middle East, it is now particularly urgent to create conditions for peaceful coexistence among all countries and to eliminate the "Cold War" that poisons the entire international situation. I think you will share my view on this point.

The Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries are striving for the arrival of a time when no major power will be able to launch aggression, including aggression against small countries. Therefore, it is precisely the major powers that should reach an agreement not to take steps that push humanity to the brink of a war disaster.

We believe that efforts should be made to develop contacts and ties between government officials of all countries. Direct meetings between leaders of various countries will help ease existing tensions, help build trust and mutual understanding between countries, and help melt the ice of the "Cold War" more quickly. The Soviet government attaches particular importance to such contacts. As you know, the Soviet government proposed convening a meeting of high-level national leaders as early as last December. We believe that as long as a high-level meeting is held with the participation of those members we previously suggested, then, with the efforts of all the participants in the meeting, it will be possible to find ways and means to eliminate the "Cold War" state and make the outbreak of a hot war impossible.

Let us make every necessary effort so that the talks that the people of all countries are looking forward to will not be delayed indefinitely. We hope that you will agree with our proposal to convene a high-level meeting and are willing to participate in such a meeting at any time. Convening a meeting at the highest level as soon as possible is in the interests of all countries, large and small.

Finally, I hope that the British government will support the proposal to convene an emergency session of the UN General Assembly. This will be a good step towards easing tensions and can lay the foundation for accelerating the holding of a high-level meeting.

With respect,
Ni. Khrushchev
August 5, 1958, in Moscow

### 赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的信

1958-08-07
第2版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的信首相先生：
    7月31日，我接到您对我7月28日关于当前中近东局势问题信件的回信。
    在苏联政府前几封信中，我们用所掌握的事实证实，美国和英国武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦在中近东造成危害和平事业的局势。因此，在您的信中硬说苏联政府对英国和美国政府行动的这种估计是无根据的，这种说法是完全违背实际情况的。
    首相先生，您在7月31日的信中说，对于召开政府首脑会议讨论中近东局势的问题，您仍旧坚持您7月22日那封信中所陈述的立场，并且还说您似乎从来没有离开过这种立场。但是我们不能同意这种说法，因为您在7月26日信中所建议的和现在所建议的都说明已经拒绝以前英国政府所支持的政府首脑会议。
    现在您主张召开安全理事会会议而不是主张召开政府首脑会议来讨论上述问题，但是全世界都知道，曾经长时期讨论过黎巴嫩和约旦局势的安全理事会直到现在没有能够通过解决这个问题的有效措施。
    美国和英国政府企图把中近东局势问题的讨论引到无结果的辩论的轨道上，这一点在艾森豪威尔先生8月1日给我的信中表现得特别明显。美国总统在这封信中极其明确地主张在安全理事会常会上讨论这个问题。
    至于您所指的可以安排“不完全正式的”政府首脑会议，从艾森豪威尔先生上述信件中就可以明显地看出来，美国政府根本不考虑在安理会常会程序之外举行政府首脑会议的可能性，然而大家都知道，在目前情况下，安全理事会大多数理事国是参加侵略集团的国家，而伟大的中华人民共和国却没有代表，当然这个机构就不能够对外国武装干涉阿拉伯东方国家的问题作出客观的结论。
    自美国和英国侵略中近东一开始，苏联就主张采取紧急措施制止侵略，使外国军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，不准扩大武装干涉，并消除英国和美国的行动所造成的危险的紧张局势。为了这些目的，苏联政府建议召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、英国、美国、法国、印度五国政府首脑会议，我们感到遗憾，您和美国总统就认为不能采纳这个建议，并继续主张仍在联合国安全理事会中讨论中近东局势问题，而这个机构是不能客观地解决这个问题的。于是召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议的问题没有得到很好的解决。
    虽然英国和美国政府已使五国会议的召开成为不可能并应对此负直接责任，但是，现在可以完全明确的断定，各国人民对立即召开这种会议来制止对约旦和黎巴嫩的武装干涉的要求以及爱好和平的国家制止对中近东侵略的决心已迫使武装干涉的发动者在这个时期内放弃了把侵略扩大到其他国家，首先是伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的计划。因此，西方国家、其中包括英国和美国，不得不承认伊拉克共和国，这并不是偶然的。而起初侵略者曾把伊拉克共和国的诞生说成是对中近东和平的威胁。然而，这并不意味着，这个地区的冲突扩大和加剧的危险性已经消除，伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的安全已有了保障。干涉军至今还没有从约旦和黎巴嫩撤退。此外，新的外国军队仍然不断开入这个地区，巴格达条约国家正在实现着新的军事措施。
    完全制止对中近东的武装干涉和在那里建立可以使这个地区的各国人民免于外国干涉的条件的问题仍然急待解决。外国军队必须立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退，因为他们在那里驻扎，是对和平和各国人民独立的经常性威胁，是对联合国宪章的不能令人容忍的破坏，任何一个联合国会员国都不能容许这样做。
    在这种情况下，苏联政府认为必须努力维护和巩固中近东的和平。既然英国和美国政府拒绝召开五国政府首脑会议，而安全理事会，正如我们已经指出的，又不能保证解决中近东局势的问题以利于和平，苏联政府为了迅速采取必要措施制止侵略，已指示自己的驻联合国代表要求召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论英国军队撤出约旦和美国军队撤出黎巴嫩的问题。苏联政府希望，既有大国也有小国代表参加的联合国大会对这个问题的讨论能够寻找出办法来消除英国和美国的行动在中近东造成的战争危险，并给这个地区带来安宁。
    首相先生，中近东事件使世界面临全面大战的威胁，而大战将会给各国人民带来无数灾难。鉴于中近东这种局势，目前显得特别迫切需要为各国和平共处创造条件，消除毒化整个国际局势的“冷战”，在这点上我想您是会和我持同样意见的。
    苏联和一切爱好和平的国家正在力争这种时候的到来，那时任何大国将都不能发动侵略，其中包括对小国的侵略。因此，正是各大国应当达成协议，彼此不要采取把人类推向战争灾难边缘的步骤。
    我们认为，应当竭力发展各国政府人士的接触和联系。各国领导人的直接会见有助于缓和现存的紧张局势，有助于建立国与国之间的信任和互相了解，有助于更快地融化“冷战”的冰雪。苏联政府特别重视这种接触，您也知道，早在去年12月，苏联政府就建议召开高级国家领导人会议。我们相信，只要举行有我们过去建议的那些成员参加的高级会议，那么在全体会议参加者的努力下，就能找到消除“冷战”状态的途径和方法，使热战的爆发成为不可能。
    让我们尽一切必要的努力，使各国人民所期待的会谈不致无止境地拖延下去。我们希望您能同意我们的关于召开高级会议的建议，并且愿意随时参加这样的会议。尽速召开最高级会议，是符合大大小小一切国家的利益的。
    最后，我希望英国政府支持关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议，这将是一个缓和紧张局势的良好步骤，并且可以为加速举行高级会议奠定基础。　　　　此致敬意
                        尼·赫鲁晓夫
