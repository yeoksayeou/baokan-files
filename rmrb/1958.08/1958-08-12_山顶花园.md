　　Hilltop Garden
    Near the county seat of Xichong County, Sichuan, on the high Millstone Mountain, there is a beautiful hilltop garden. In the garden are two stone memorial archways. On the lintel of one archway are carved seven red characters: "Socialism has arrived!" On either side is a couplet: "The Great Leap Forward war drums shake heaven and earth, the heroes are determined to shake mountains and rivers." The lintel of the other archway reads: "Splendid Rivers and Mountains," and the couplet reads: "Green mountains flow with green water, barren land turns into fertile fields." In the very center is a large flower bed, blooming with passion flowers, mixed chrysanthemums, and cockscomb flowers. Many new flowers, plants, and saplings have been planted all around. Stone benches and tables are also placed there for visitors to rest and play chess. Everyone who has been here is moved by this fresh creation and beautiful scenery.
    This year in March, the CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee put forward the call to "Fight hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of the countryside," which aroused the great ambition of the members of the Heming No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinxin Township to march towards nature. They said: "In the past, nature stumped us, but now we will make it listen to us." After several months of their efforts, the previously uneven small roads have now been repaired into a flat avenue one and a half meters wide and seven li long, and vehicles can directly reach the fields. Wenjun Mountain, Daluo Mountain, Magou Mountain, Heming'an Mountain, Mandong Mountain, and Millstone Mountain, which were originally red and bald, have been transformed into fertile terraced fields, and cotton plants and sweet potato vines grow particularly luxuriantly all over the mountains. Fifty-two reservoirs and "Leap Forward Ponds" ripple with blue waves, and fish frolic in them. The dilapidated thatched houses originally scattered in more than ten places have been turned into two rows of newly built buildings. They have also set up a collective canteen, and all members of the cooperative, regardless of gender or age, eat in the canteen. A newly built twelve-kilowatt power station provides bright electric lights in every household at night, and the members of the cooperative live a new and happy life.
    In order to commemorate the victory of building the mountainous area, they built a hilltop garden on Millstone Mountain.

　　山顶花园
    在四川西充县城附近的一座高高的磨盘山上，有一个美丽的山顶花园。花园中有两座石牌坊。一座牌坊的横额上刻着七个红字：“社会主义到来了”！两旁是一副对联：“大跃进战鼓动天地，众英雄决心震山河。”另一座牌坊的横额是：“河山锦绣”，对联是：“青山流绿水，瘠土变肥田。”正中间一个大花坛，盛开着西番莲、杂色菊、鸡冠花。四周新栽了许多花草和树苗。旁边还摆着石凳石桌，供游人歇息、下棋。凡是到过这里的人，没有不为这新鲜的创造和美丽的景色感动的。
    今年3月，中共南充地委提出了“苦战三年，基本改变农村面貌”的号召，激起了晋新乡鹤鸣第一农业生产合作社广大社员向自然进军的雄心。他们说：“从前大自然把我们难住了，现在要叫它听我们的话。”经过他们几个月的努力，原来高低不平的小路，现在修成宽一公尺半长达七里的平坦大道，车子可以直达田边地畔。文军山、打锣山、麻沟山、鹤鸣庵山、蛮洞山、磨盘山等六座高山，原来都是红山秃岭，变成了肥沃的梯地，遍山的棉株和苕藤长得特别茂盛。五十二个蓄水池和“跃进山塘”，碧波荡漾，游鱼嬉戏其中。原来分散在十多处的破房茅屋，变成了两排新建的楼房。还办起集体食堂，全体社员不分男女老少都到食堂吃饭。新修了一座十二瓩的发电站，入夜家家电灯通明，社员过着新的幸福生活。
    为了纪念建设山区的胜利，他们就在磨盘山上修建了一座山顶花园。
