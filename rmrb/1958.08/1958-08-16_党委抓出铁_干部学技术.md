　　Party Committee Grasps Iron Production; Cadres Learn Technology

　　Our newspaper's Yichang dispatch, August 15th (Reporter Hai Bo): After a large number of small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces were built, how to ensure they produce iron normally? The General Delegation of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's Industry and Agriculture Inspection Group, after on-site visits and research in Yichang City, and convening symposiums with local experts and foreign experts, believes that: Political leadership must be emphasized to ensure the normal production of iron from blast furnaces.

　　In the past two months, Yichang City has built three small blast furnaces and twenty-five indigenous blast furnaces, with more under construction. Among the blast furnaces that have already been built, the production of some is not normal. Some have slag and iron mixed together, some have molten iron solidified inside the furnace, and some produce very few batches of iron before the furnace body is burned out.

　　The Hubei Provincial Party Committee Inspection Group and some experts went to the site to conduct research with workers and technicians, and found that the main reason for the abnormal production of these blast furnaces is that technology is not keeping up with production requirements. For example, some furnaces are built with disproportionate parts; some have inappropriate wind power; some use too few refractory materials; in addition, there are problems in batching, baking the furnace, and other aspects. According to research, the main reason for these problems is that politics has not been given sufficient leadership. The current situation is that there is great enthusiasm for building furnaces, and one can be built in a few nights, but many leading cadres have not promptly paid attention to how to make the blast furnace produce iron normally as quickly as possible. They have only remained at the level of general calls, and have not taken the lead in working hard to learn technology and take charge of iron production.

　　The Inspection Group pointed out, based on existing experience, that it is not difficult to get the blast furnace to produce iron normally. The key is to put politics in command. Specific measures are: First, the Party committee should regard the problem of blast furnace iron production as the main task at present and give it prominence. This first requires the Party secretary and relevant ministers, factory directors, and workers to arduously study iron-making technology. Second, establish demonstration furnaces, plant red flags, and create experiences to be promoted comprehensively. Third, unify arrangements and comprehensively coordinate. In particular, the city should uniformly plan and arrange for ore and refractory materials to avoid waste and facilitate production.

　　The Yichang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has already acted according to the instructions of the Inspection Group. Cadres have begun to learn iron-making technology. Workers have expressed confidence in making blast furnaces produce iron normally as soon as possible.

### 党委抓出铁　干部学技术

　　党委抓出铁　干部学技术
    本报宜昌15日电　记者海波报道：大批小型高炉和土高炉建成以后，如何使它们正常出铁？中共湖北省委工农业检查团总团最近在宜昌市通过现场参观和研究，并召集土专家、洋专家一起座谈后认为：必须政治挂帅，才能保证高炉正常出铁。
    宜昌市两个多月来，建成小型高炉三个，土高炉二十五个，还有一批正在建设。已经建成的高炉中，有一部分生产不正常。有的渣、铁不分，有的铁水凝固在炉内，有的出很少几炉铁，炉体就被烧坏了。
    湖北省委检查团和一些专家们到现场同工人、技术人员一起进行了研究，发现这些高炉生产不正常的主要原因，是技术跟不上生产要求。如有的炉各部分建得不合比例；有的风力大小不合适；有的用的耐火材料过少；另外在配料、烘炉等方面也有问题。据研究，产生这些问题的主要原因，是政治没有很好挂帅。目前的情况是，建炉的劲头很大，几夜可以建成一个，但是不少领导干部对如何使高炉迅速正常出铁还没有及时重视起来。他们只停留在一般号召上，没有带头艰苦地去学习技术，把出铁抓起来。
    检查团根据已有的经验指出，让高炉正常出铁是不难作到的。关键是政治挂帅。具体措施是：第一，党委应把高炉出铁问题，当作当前的主要任务，突出地抓起来。这首先要求党委书记和有关的部长、厂长、工人一律要艰苦钻研炼铁技术。第二，建立示范炉，插红旗，创造经验全面推广。第三，统一安排，全面协作。特别是对矿石、耐火材料要全市统一计划安排，避免浪费，以利生产。
    中共宜昌市委员会已经根据检查团的指示行动起来。干部已经开始学炼铁技术。工人们纷纷表示有信心早日使高炉正常出铁。
