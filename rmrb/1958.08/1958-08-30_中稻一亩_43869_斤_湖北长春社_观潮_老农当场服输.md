Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th—Changchun Commune in Baihu Township, Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, created an astonishing record of 43,869 jin and four liang of dry rice per mu on a 1.01 mu plot of mid-season rice. This is 793 jin and eleven liang more than the 43,075 jin and nine liang per mu of mid-season rice produced by Dongfanghong Third Cooperative in Fanchang County, Anhui Province.

　　This plot of high-yield land in Changchun Commune was cultivated jointly by Yang Caixuan, the leader of the Twelfth Production Team, Yang Sanhai, the leader of the Youth Commando Team, and commune members such as Yang Linzhang. During the harvest, the Yingcheng County Party Committee and the County People's Committee jointly organized an acceptance team for inspection. They personally participated in the cutting, bundling, threshing, and weighing work, and measured the area of the field. The results confirmed that this field produced a total of 44,308 jin of dry rice, with an average yield of 43,869 jin per mu.

　　The seeds for this high-yield field were all Victory Indica selected last year, with a sowing amount of 250 jin. The field was deeply plowed to a depth of 1.2 chi, and sufficient base fertilizer was applied in combination with plowing four times. After tillering, fertilizer was applied twice more according to the needs of the seedlings. The planting density was very high; it is estimated that the entire field had more than 428,000 plants. In addition, Yang Caixuan and others also took measures to ensure light and ventilation for the seedlings and prevent lodging, and regularly sprayed pesticides to eliminate pests, so that this field never suffered from diseases, pests, or lodging. At maturity, the most productive plants had 24 ears, and the least had 7 ears. The ear length was generally between 22 cm and 25 cm, and each ear had an average of more than 170 grains.

　　Four old farmers excitedly and shamefully recounted the changes in their thinking about the high yield of this field before and after it was achieved. Yang Chunyuan, a 50-year-old well-to-do middle peasant, said: "When I first saw them cultivating this experimental field, they plowed it very deeply, applied too much fertilizer, and planted the seedlings too densely. I said to them: 'If this field can harvest grain, cut off my head.' When the rice seedlings emerged completely, our thinking changed, but we still didn't believe it could yield tens of thousands of jin. On the day of the harvest, the four of us conservatives discussed and divided the work ourselves: Yang Bingqing was responsible for cutting and bundling the rice, Yang Bingyuan was responsible for carrying the rice, Yang Deqing was responsible for threshing the rice, and I was responsible for watching the scales. Who knew that we actually threshed more than 40,000 jin."

　　The Xiaogan Branch of the Agricultural Inspection Group of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, which was working in Yingcheng County, awarded the team a red flag on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee after the acceptance, encouraging them to advance victoriously and strive for a greater late rice harvest.

　　中稻一亩43869斤
    湖北长春社“观潮”老农当场服输
    新华社武汉29日电　湖北省应城县白湖乡长春社在一点零一亩中稻田里创造了平均亩产干谷四万三千八百六十九斤四两的惊人纪录。这比安徽省繁昌县东方红三社中稻亩产四万三千零七十五斤九两高出七百九十三斤十一两。
    长春社的这块田是由第十二生产队队长杨采轩和青年突击队队长杨三海及社员杨林章等七人共同培育的。收割时应城县委和县人民委员会共同组织验收组进行了验收。他们亲自参加割、捆、打、秤等工作，并丈量了田的面积，结果证实这块田共产干谷四万四千三百零八斤，平均亩产四万三千八百六十九斤。
    这块高产田的种子全是去年挑选的胜利籼，播种量二百五十斤，深翻达一点二尺，结合耕田分四次施用了充足的底肥，分蘖后又根据禾苗需要追了两次肥，密植程度很高，据推算全田有四十二万八千多蔸，此外杨采轩等还采取措施使禾苗透光通风和防止倒伏，并经常打药除虫，使这块田始终没有发生病虫害和倒伏，成熟时每蔸最多的有二十四穗，最少的也有七穗，穗长一般在二十二公分到二十五公分之间，每穗平均有一百七十多粒。
    四个老农兴奋而又惭愧地叙述了他们对这块田高产前后思想的转变情况。五十多岁的富裕中农杨春元说：“开始看到他们搞这块试验田耕得很深，肥料下得太多，秧栽得密，我对他们说：这块田要能收谷就砍我的头。谷子出齐时，我们思想才转变了，但还不相信能收几万斤。到收割那天，我们四个老保守派就自己商量分工：杨炳清负责割谷捆谷，杨炳元负责挑谷，杨得清负责打谷，我就负责看磅，谁知硬是打了四万多斤。”
    正在应城县工作的中共湖北省委农业检查团孝感分团在验收后，代表省委、省人民委员会奖给这个队一面红旗，鼓励他们乘胜前进，争取晚稻更大丰收。
