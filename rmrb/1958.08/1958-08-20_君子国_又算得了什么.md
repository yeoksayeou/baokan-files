　　What is the "Land of Gentlemen"?
　　 Chen Zhiyan
　　The novel "Flowers in the Mirror" once described the appearance of the Land of Gentlemen, saying how people there were modest and courteous. Things like "Farmers yield the field borders; travelers yield the road," and "Whether rich or poor, commoners, their behavior and speech are all respectful and courteous..." etc. In fact, this kind of Land of Gentlemen has never existed for even a single day. It's just a utopia for some people. This kind of country has distinctions between rich and poor, so the gentlemanly style is very limited. And this kind of Land of Gentlemen is nothing compared to a socialist society. Look at the "Eight No's" news from the Jianhua Factory in Qiqihar published in today's newspaper, how exciting it is! Communist consciousness is rising here like the morning sun, and people's mental outlook is undergoing drastic changes. The profound impact of the great rectification movement is being reflected in people's daily lives.
    History has seen many revolutions, and each revolution has changed the material production and the spiritual outlook of society to varying degrees. However, no revolution has changed people's spiritual outlook as thoroughly as the socialist revolution. This is because only the socialist revolution has finally eliminated exploitation, while the result of any other revolution is only a transition from one system of exploitation to another. The great French writer Balzac, in his "Human Comedy," mercilessly satirized the ugly souls of the 18th-century French feudal aristocracy. And the modern bourgeoisie is even more ugly than the feudal aristocracy, even though France has experienced a bourgeois revolution.
    The implementation of the "Eight No's" new system in the Jianhua Factory shows that the socialist system not only changes the ownership of the means of production but is also creating a completely new generation of people.
    Don't think this is nothing great. If you think about how, not long ago, in the era of old China, people were worried even when they closed their doors to sleep at night, and now no one even guards the payroll, you will understand how significant it is. This change is incomparable to any capitalist civilization, where people are constantly guarding against theft, robbery, assassination...
    Marx said that the working class also transforms itself in the struggle to transform the world. Our working class is realizing Marx's great teachings.

### “君子国”又算得了什么

　　“君子国”又算得了什么
　　 陈之衍
      “镜花缘”这本小说中，曾经描写了一番君子国的面貌，说那里的人们如何谦让成风。什么
  “耕者让畔；行者让路”，什么“士庶人等无论富贵贫贱，举止言谈，莫不恭而有礼，……”等等。其实，这种君子国，从古到今也没有存在过一天。只不过是一些人的乌托邦吧了。这种国度既有富贵贫贱之分，君子之风也就有限得很。而这种君子国比起社会主义社会来，实在是算不了什么的。请看，今天本报发表的齐齐哈尔建华工厂的“八无”新闻，是多么地激动人心啊，共产主义的自觉，在这里如旭日高升，人们的精神面貌经历着剧烈改变。伟大的整风运动所带来的深刻影响，正在人们的日常生活中体现出来。
    历史上有过许多次的革命，每一次革命，都在不同的程度上改变着社会的物质生产面貌和人们的精神面貌。然而没有一次革命，能像社会主义革命这样，给人的精神面貌以如此彻底的改变。这是因为只有社会主义革命才最终消灭了剥削，而任何其它革命的结果，只不过是从一个剥削制度过渡到另一个剥削制度罢了。法国的大文学家巴尔扎克在他的“人间喜剧”里，曾经无情地讽刺过十八世纪法国封建贵族的丑恶灵魂。而现代资产阶级比起封建贵族的丑恶来，有过之无不及，虽然法国经历过资产阶级的大革命。
    建华工厂实行“八无”新制度，说明社会主义制度不仅仅改变了生产资料的所有制，而且正在造就一代全新的人。
    不要以为这没有什么了不起。如果想一想没有多久以前，在旧中国的时代，人们晚上关着门睡觉都提心吊胆，而现在连发工资都没有人管，就会明了它有多么大的意义。这种改变，是任何资本主义文明所无法比拟的，在那里人们每时每刻都在防备着偷盗、抢劫、暗杀……。
    马克思说过，工人阶级在改造世界的斗争中也改造自己。我国的工人阶级正在实现着马克思的伟大教言。
