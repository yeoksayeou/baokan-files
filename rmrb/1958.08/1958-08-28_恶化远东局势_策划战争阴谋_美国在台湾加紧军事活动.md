Xinhua News Agency, August 27th—The United States is preparing to send a Marine Corps Air Wing to invade and garrison Taiwan, expanding provocative activities in the Taiwan area. U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force generals have been active in Taiwan for days, plotting war conspiracies.

According to Tokyo reports, a U.S. Marine Corps spokesman stationed in Iwakuni, Japan, said on the 26th that the U.S. 1st Marine Aircraft Wing would fly from Japan to Taiwan this week. These troops would be drawn from the Atsugi base south of Tokyo and the Iwakuni base near Hiroshima in southern Honshu. According to the spokesman, this U.S. Marine Corps Air Wing will participate in the U.S.-Chiang joint military exercise to be held in Fangliao, southern Taiwan, in early September. Sources say U.S. military officials are considering sending a mixed Air Force attack force to invade and garrison Taiwan.

U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Commander Mooreman flew to Taipei on the 26th and held meetings with U.S. "Taiwan Defense Command" Commander Smoot, Deputy Commander Bassett, and U.S. Thirteenth Air Force's Taiwan Task Force Commander Dean. Smoot and Dean also held lengthy meetings with Wang Shu-ming, "Chief of Staff" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's traitorous army, and Chen Chia-shang, "Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force," and others. Reports say these meetings discussed operational issues related to the U.S. Air Force and the Chiang bandit air force. U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley also arrived in Taiwan on the evening of the 26th. U.S. Army Secretary Bruck, who was in Japan on the 26th, will go to Taiwan to "inspect" within days.

In addition, according to Tokyo reports, the U.S. Fifth Air Force stationed in Japan, South Korea, and Okinawa, and the U.S. naval forces stationed in the Philippines have all announced that they have entered a so-called "heightened state of alert."
