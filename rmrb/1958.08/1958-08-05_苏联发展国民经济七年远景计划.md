    The work on formulating the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Perspective Plan for the Development of the National Economy has been underway for approximately a year. The process of formulating this perspective plan is as follows: from various production enterprises to various economic regions and republics, the masses were mobilized to conduct detailed discussions and formulate plans for their own enterprises and regions, which were then unified by the State Planning Committee. The State Planning Committee, based on the overall situation, finalized the entire plan and submitted it to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers for review and publication. This plan is clearly of utmost importance to the great leap forward in the Soviet Union's national economy.

    **The Proposal of the Seven-Year Perspective Plan**

    The Seven-Year Perspective Plan, from 1959 to 1965, actually includes the last two years of the Sixth Five-Year Plan and the seven years of the next Five-Year Plan. Therefore, this plan not only supplemented the content of the Sixth Five-Year Plan in a timely manner according to the needs of economic development, but also put forward the plan for the next stage in advance and made full arrangements. This is an important improvement in the planning work itself.

    Experience has proved that in order to solve a basic historical task, in addition to the current plan, there must also be a long-term plan. This allows for foresight and a grasp of the key points. The Soviet Union's past All-Russian Electrification Plan was actually a long-term plan. Now, in addition to the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union is also talking about the issue of a general plan for the national economy. The general plan will be a broader long-term plan.

    The Seven-Year Perspective Plan is proposed on the basis of the Five-Year Plan. Two years have passed since the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The implementation of the plan in these two years has been very good. In two years, the total output of various industrial products in the Soviet Union increased by 22%, exceeding the targets set by the plan. In 1956, the Soviet Union built more than 800 factories. On the basis of such a rapid surge, the Seven-Year Perspective Plan puts forward even newer tasks.

    The Soviet Union's national economy is undergoing fundamental changes. At this stage, national economic development requires more rapid and comprehensive implementation of new technologies, requires more rational and concentrated use of funds, and requires adapting to the situation after changes in the economic management system. In recent years, the Soviet Union has discovered a large amount of underground natural wealth. According to the decisions of the Party and the government, new construction tasks have been put on the agenda for the Soviet Union one after another. For example, the issue of accelerating housing construction. These changes and new tasks must naturally be reflected in the Seven-Year Perspective Plan.

    **Several Major Aspects**

    The detailed content and actual figures of the Seven-Year Perspective Plan will only be fully known after it is completed and published. However, Soviet newspapers have already provided a lot of information on the important tasks and major aspects of the perspective plan.

    According to the Seven-Year Perspective Plan, the grand scale of construction in the Soviet Union will be mainly concentrated in the eastern region. The Soviet Union will rapidly develop the ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries, the chemical industry, the fuel industry dominated by oil and gas, the electric power industry, and comprehensively promote electrification. In agriculture, it will comprehensively develop grains, cotton, and oil crops, and at the same time solve the problem of making livestock products catch up with the United States on a per capita basis. In construction, shorten the construction period of factories and mining enterprises, concentrate the use of funds, and greatly accelerate the speed of housing construction. The production of consumer goods will also increase by leaps and bounds.

    The main task of the Seven-Year Perspective Plan is, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, to ensure the further huge surge in all sectors of the national economy, so as to take a new and major step forward in solving the basic tasks of Soviet economic construction. It is clear that the Seven-Year Perspective Plan will be a major step in catching up with and surpassing the United States.

    During the Seven-Year Perspective Plan, the Soviet Union will establish a strong raw material base for ferrous and non-ferrous metals; will build a large number of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, many non-ferrous metal factories, hundreds of machine factories and chemical factories; will build large atomic power stations, large thermal power stations, and hydropower stations even larger than the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station; will gradually replace steam locomotives with electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives; will massively exploit oil and gas to change the balance structure of fuel.

    The Seven-Year Perspective Plan will also establish a large number of automatic production lines, automatic workshops, so that production is fully automated, greatly improving productivity. The Seven-Year Plan will bring the housing problem close to complete resolution, and the people's living standards will be greatly improved compared to now.

    **The Grand Scale of Developing the East**

    A prominent feature of the Seven-Year Perspective Plan is the development of the vast eastern region, which is rich in resources. The eastern region of the Soviet Union concentrates 75% of the country's coal reserves, 80% of its water resources, four-fifths of its timber, and 51% of its iron ore. Non-ferrous metals and rare metals are also exceptionally abundant in the eastern region.

    In the past, the Soviet Union's development of the eastern region was more focused on the Urals and its connected areas. The Seven-Year Perspective Plan, however, mainly focuses on Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Far East region east of the Urals. The development of resources in this area will lead to a leap in the Soviet Union's economic strength. The measures to develop the eastern region further demonstrate the importance of the Seven-Year Perspective Plan.

    In the future, almost all hydropower station construction will be concentrated in the eastern region. In addition to the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station and the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station, which are already under construction and are the two largest hydropower stations in the world, the power generation capacity of the hydropower stations to be started will exceed them. In terms of ferrous metals, except for one or two factories that may be in the western region, all others will be in the eastern region in the future. In today's increasingly important non-ferrous metals and rare metals, the eastern region will also become a base for non-ferrous metals during the Seven-Year Plan.

    The Seven-Year Perspective Plan will also open up infinitely beautiful prospects for agriculture in the eastern region. In the past two years of the land reclamation movement, the eastern region has shown its unlimited potential in agricultural production, and its position will become increasingly important in the future. The eastern region will become the Soviet Union's main grain production area and meat production area. In the Seven-Year Plan, the grain output of the Soviet Union's eastern region may exceed Ukraine's by a factor of two.

    The Soviet Union is now mobilizing one million young people to participate in construction, most of whom are going to the eastern region. During the Seven-Year Plan, a large number of young people will be mobilized to go to the eastern region every year to gradually solve the problem of insufficient labor force for developing the eastern region.

    **Catching Up With and Surpassing the United States**

    The basic economic task of the Soviet Union is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of product output per capita in the shortest historical period. This task can be completed in about fifteen years. After the Seven-Year Perspective Plan is completed, the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural output will be very close to the level of the United States.

    In terms of the speed of economic development, the Soviet Union has long defeated the United States. Since the founding of the Soviet Union to the present, the annual increase in industrial output has been 10%, while the United States has only increased by 3.2% annually. In the past ten years, the Soviet Union's industrial output has increased by an average of 15.9% annually, while the United States has only increased by 4.7%. The speed in the Seven-Year Perspective Plan will be a leap forward speed, and the average speed will increase year by year.

    The Soviet Union's economic production capacity and technical strength have already surpassed the United States in many aspects. This is not only the case in many important technical strengths, but also in some industrial and agricultural products. It can be predicted that in the Seven-Year Perspective Plan, the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural production will increasingly catch up with and surpass the United States in batches and phases.

    The Soviet Union already has some important industrial and agricultural products that are very close to the level of the United States. For example, in terms of iron ore output, the Soviet Union mined 84 million tons last year, only 14 million tons less than the United States, and the Soviet Union's output was 86% of the United States' output. According to the current development of iron ore output, it is clear that in the first year or two of the Seven-Year Perspective Plan, the Soviet Union will leave the United States behind, first in terms of absolute output, and then in terms of output per capita. For example, in terms of coal mines, the Soviet Union's output last year reached 96% of the United States'. In light industry, the Soviet Union's output of silk fabrics last year reached 94% of the United States'. Such products will of course soon surpass the United States.

    The situation in agriculture is also the same. The fact that the United States is being surpassed in batches and phases will continue to appear during the Seven-Year Perspective Plan.

    **The General Plan for the National Economy**

    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Perspective Plan will be linked with the Soviet Union's General Plan for the National Economy and become an organic component of the latter. The General Plan for the National Economy will include the period of several Five-Year Plans.

    The General Plan for the National Economy is now under consideration and research by the planning agencies. The General Plan for the National Economy will be formulated in accordance with the outline of catching up with and surpassing the United States in fifteen years mentioned by Comrade Khrushchev in his speech at the Supreme Soviet celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The General Plan for the National Economy will be a plan that finally leaves the United States behind. After its completion, the Soviet Union's basic economic task will be solved. In the peaceful competition, the socialist economic system will finally defeat the capitalist economic system.

    The Soviet Union's General Plan for the National Economy will bring the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural production, the people's cultural and living standards to new heights, and will cause profound qualitative changes in the period of transition from socialism to communism.

    This perspective plan will not only estimate the needs of Soviet economic development, but also estimate the needs of the economic development of the entire socialist camp and the issue of cooperation between socialist countries. For example, the Soviet Union is the largest oil producing region in the socialist camp, so the development indicators for oil stipulated in the General Plan for the National Economy will not only estimate the situation in the Soviet Union, but also estimate the needs of the entire socialist camp.

    The Soviet Union's perspective plan is a plan for a leap forward, a plan to defeat the most developed capitalist countries, a plan to mobilize natural wealth on a grand scale to serve the welfare of the Soviet people and the interests of the socialist camp.

    苏联发展国民经济七年远景计划
    李楠
    苏联的国民经济七年远景计划的制订工作，已经进行了约一年的时间。这个远景计划制订的过程是：从各个生产企业到各经济区、各共和国都动员了群众，进行了详细的讨论，制定了本企业和本区的计划，然后统一到国家计划委员会；由国家计划委员会根据全面情况最后全部制成，送交苏共中央和部长会议审查公布。这个计划对于苏联国民经济的大跃进显然有极其重要的意义。
    七年远景计划的提出
    七年远景计划从1959年到1965年，实际上包括了第六个五年计划的后两年以及下一个五年计划的七年时间。因此，这个计划一方面根据经济发展的需要及时补充了第六个五年计划的内容，同时又预先提出了下一个阶段的计划，并作了充分的安排。这是计划工作本身的一个重要改进。
    经验证明，对于解决一个基本的历史性的任务，除了现阶段的计划，还必须有远景规划。这样就能够高瞻远瞩，提纲挈领。苏联过去的全俄电气化计划，实际上就是一个远景规划。现在，除了七年计划之外，苏联又在谈论国民经济总计划的问题。总计划将是一个包罗更广的远景计划。
    七年远景计划是在五年计划的基础上提出的。第六个五年计划已过去了两年。这两年的计划执行情况非常良好。两年内苏联各种工业产品总产量增加了22％，超过了计划规定的指标。1956年，苏联建成的工厂有八百多个。在这样急剧高涨的基础上，七年远景计划更提出了新的任务。
    苏联的国民经济正在起着本质的变化。在现阶段，国民经济发展要求更迅速、更全面地实施新技术，要求更合理更集中地利用资金，要求更适合经济管理制度改变后的形势。在最近几年内，苏联发现了大量的地下天然财富。根据党和政府的决定，苏联一个个新的建设任务又提到日程上来了。例如加速住宅建设的问题。这些变化和新任务自然要反映到七年远景计划当中去。
    几个主要方面
    七年远景计划的详细内容和实际数字要等完成公布之后才能全部知道。但远景计划的重要任务和主要方面，苏联报刊已经有了不少的介绍。
    根据七年远景计划，苏联建设的宏伟规模主要集中在东部地区。苏联将迅速发展黑色和有色金属工业、化学工业、以石油和瓦斯为主的燃料工业、电力工业和全面推行电气化。在农业方面，将全面发展谷物、棉花、油脂作物，同时解决按人口计算使畜牧业产品赶上美国的问题。在建设方面，缩短厂矿企业建设日期，集中使用资金，大大加快住宅建设速度。消费品的生产也将突飞猛进。
    七年远景计划的主要任务是，在优先发展重工业的基础上，保证国民经济各个部门的进一步巨大高涨，以便在解决苏联经济建设的基本任务上向前迈进新的一大步。很显然，七年远景计划将是赶上并超过美国的一项重大步骤。
    在七年远景计划期间，苏联将建立强大的黑色和有色金属的原料基地；将建立大批的高炉、平炉、轧钢机、许多有色金属工厂，数以百计的机器工厂和化学工厂；将建成大原子能电站、大热电站和比古比雪夫水电站规模更大的水电站；将使电气机车内燃机车逐渐全部代替蒸汽机车；将大量开采石油和瓦斯，以改变燃料的平衡结构。
    七年远景计划还要建立大批自动工作线，自动车间，使生产全面自动化，大大提高生产力。七年计划将使住宅问题接近于完全解决，人民的生活水平将比现在更加大大提高。
    开发东部的宏伟规模
    七年远景计划中一个突出的特色是，发展土地辽阔、资源雄厚的东部地区。苏联东部地区集中了全苏75％的煤藏、80％的水力资源、五分之四的木材、51％的铁矿。有色金属和稀有金属在东部地区也异常丰富。
    苏联过去对东部地区的开发比较偏重于乌拉尔及其相连地带。七年远景计划却主要在乌拉尔以东的西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦和远东区。这一带地区的资源开发起来，将使苏联的经济力量飞跃发展。开发东部地区的措施，更加显示出七年远景计划的重要意义。
    今后大约水电站建设将全部集中在东部地区。除已在动工中的布拉次克水电站和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站是世界上最大的两个水电站而外，将要开工的水电站发电能力还要超过它们。在黑色金属方面，今后除一、两个工厂可能在西部地区以外，其他都将在东部地区。在有色金属和稀有金属日趋重要的今天，东部地区也将在七年计划期间成为一个有色金属的基地。
    七年远景计划还将为东部地区的农业开辟无限美好的远景。东部地区在前两年的开荒运动中，已显示在农业生产上的无限潜力，今后地位将愈加重要。东部地区将成为苏联的主要谷物产区和肉类产区。在七年计划中，苏联东部地区的谷物产量可能超过乌克兰一倍。
    苏联现在已在动员一百万青年参加建设，其中大部分是去东部地区的。在七年计划中，每年都将要动员大批青年去东部地区，逐步解决开发东部地区的劳动力不足的问题。
    赶上和超过美国
    苏联的基本经济任务是，在最短的历史时期内，在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。这个任务大约在十五年内即可完成。七年远景计划完成后，苏联的工农业产量就将很接近美国的水平了。
    在经济发展的速度问题上，苏联早已击败了美国。苏联从开国以来到现在，每年工业产量增加10％，而美国每年只增加3.2％。在最近十年内，苏联的工业产量每年平均增加15.9％，而美国只增加4.7％。七年远景计划中的速度将是飞跃的速度，平均速度将年年增加。
    苏联的经济生产能力和技术力量已经有许多方面压倒了美国。这不仅在许多重要的技术力量上是如此，而且在一些工农业产品上也是如此。可以预料，在七年远景计划中，苏联的工农业生产将愈来愈多地分批分期地赶上并超过美国。
    苏联已有一些重要的工农业产品十分接近美国的水平。例如铁矿产量，去年苏联开采了八千四百万吨，只比美国少一千四百万吨，苏联产量为美国产量的86％。根据当前铁矿产量发展的情况来看，很显然，在七年远景计划的头一两年内，苏联就会把美国扔在后面，首先是在绝对产量方面，然后是按人口平均计算的产量方面。又例如煤矿，去年苏联的产量已达到美国的96％。轻工业中的丝织品去年苏联产量已达到美国的94％。这类产品当然很快就会超过美国。
    农业中的情况也是如此。分批分期地超过美国的事实在七年远景计划期间将不断出现。
    国民经济总计划
    苏联的七年远景计划将会和苏联国民经济总计划联结在一起，而成为后者的有机组成部分。国民经济总计划将包括几个五年计划的时期。
    国民经济总计划现在已经在计划机关考虑和研究当中。国民经济总计划将以赫鲁晓夫同志在苏最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念大会上讲话中提到的十五年内赶上和超过美国的轮廓拟订。
    国民经济总计划将是一个最后把美国扔在后面的计划。完成之后，苏联的基本经济任务就解决了。在和平竞赛中，社会主义的经济制度最后将战胜资本主义经济制度。
    苏联的国民经济总计划将使苏联的工农业生产、人民的文化和生活水平达到新的高峰，将在从社会主义过渡到共产主义时期，引起深刻的质的变化。
    这个远景计划不仅将要估计到苏联经济发展的需要，并且也将估计到整个社会主义阵营经济发展的需要和社会主义各国间的协作问题。例如，苏联是社会主义阵营中最大的石油产区，因此国民经济总计划规定的发展石油的指标，将不仅估计苏联的情况，还要估计到整个社会主义阵营的需要。
    苏联的远景计划是一个跃进的计划，是战胜最发达的资本主义国家的计划，是以宏大的规模，动员自然财富，为苏联人民的福利和社会主义阵营的利益服务的计划。
