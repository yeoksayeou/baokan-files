　　Strong Defender of Peace
　　——Premier Sihanouk Visits Air Force Performance
　　By Our Reporter Yu Minsheng
    On the morning of the 23rd, the sun blazed. Four jet fighters appeared in the azure sky dotted with white clouds, and a wonderful aerobatic performance by the Air Force officially began.

    From the beginning, Premier Sihanouk was captivated by the superhuman flying skills of the Air Force pilots. The Premier looked up at the sky, pointing to the four silver swallows that sometimes flew into the clouds and sometimes appeared in the air performing in formation, and repeatedly praised Vice Premier He Long and Vice Premier Chen Yi, who were sitting on either side of him, saying, "The training is excellent, and the movements are very skilled!"

    Two new jet silver swallows appeared in the high sky, performing double-plane formation aerobatics. They moved forward side by side, maintaining a distance of about twenty meters at all times. One moment they were in the clouds more than four thousand meters above, and the next they were diving to a low altitude only a few dozen meters above the ground. They rose together, dived together, and somersaulted together up, down, left, and right. The skill was so refined that it was like a work of art, and the performance was as free and agile as swallows. Premier Sihanouk's gaze followed the two planes all the time. He repeatedly praised, "Good, extremely good, the performance is too perfect!"

    Not long after, two more planes skimmed over the low altitude. White smoke rose where the planes passed, followed by rumbling explosions. Air Force Deputy Commander Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang told the Premier, "This is a ground target practice." Colonel Zhao Peizhang, the division commander of this Air Force division, introduced to the Premier, "This type of aircraft has a wide killing area. Once it strafes the enemy's artillery positions or tank positions, it can destroy them all!" At this time, Premier Sihanouk raised his binoculars to carefully observe the area with white smoke.

    The most exciting part was the solo fast performance made by our domestically produced aircraft. The plane took off after only running a short distance on the runway, soaring straight into the clouds four to five thousand meters high. It rotated straight up, tumbled again and again, and flew high again and again. Premier Sihanouk watched with such interest that he cheered repeatedly and clapped non-stop.

    Next were the parachute jumps performed by Air Force soldiers and amateur athletes. The Premier greatly praised their parachuting skills, saying that they were "well-trained and performed movingly."

    While watching the performance, Premier Sihanouk inquired about the training of our Air Force soldiers. Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Our Air Force was trained on the Korean battlefield." Vice Premier He Long said with a smile to the Premier, "American imperialism was our 'teacher,' and it taught us."

    "Our Air Force soldiers are all sons and daughters of workers and peasants. They love the motherland and have deep feelings for the people. They are willing to learn, able to study diligently, and accept advanced technology quickly. They are strong and brave!" Vice Premier Chen Yi further introduced to the Premier.

    "The greatest characteristic of our Air Force soldiers is bravery!" Vice Premier He Long also interjected.

    "I know that as far back as the Korean War, the spirit of heroic struggle of Chinese Air Force soldiers was already famous all over the world!" Premier Sihanouk said admiringly.

    At this time, the Air Force pilots who participated in the flight performance and the amateur parachutists lined up and came to Premier Sihanouk. The Premier was so excited and moved when he met these young soldiers. He said to this group of young soldiers, "We are very grateful for your excellent performance. We admire your skilled flying techniques, and you are role models for us to learn from. You are all excellent young people, and you and Chinese youth are together building and defending your own country. During the Korean War, you were already famous all over the world, and many people know about your brave actions and spirit of heroic struggle."

    After a burst of warm applause subsided, the Premier said again, "We come from a country that is friendly to China. Our friendship has a history of more than a thousand years. We are very happy to see that we can rely on your superhuman technology and bravery to defend our common freedom and peace!"

    These words of the Premier, full of friendly passion, once again won the warm applause of the soldiers.

    Then, Vice Premier Chen Yi said to the soldiers very happily, "Today, after Premier Sihanouk watched the performance, he gave you a very high evaluation. You must step up your training, the safety of the motherland depends on you, you must complete the tasks assigned to you by the motherland! Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!"

    At this time, Vice Premier He Long said to the Premier, "Our powerful Air Force is to defend world peace, especially to defend Asian peace!"

    "Yes! You are defending justice! Justice will surely triumph!" the Premier said excitedly. (Attached picture)

　　和平的坚强保卫者
　　——记西哈努克首相参观空军表演
　　本报记者　于民生
    23日上午，烈日高照。四架喷气式战斗机出现在飘着朵朵白云的蔚蓝色天空中，一场精彩的空军特技表演正式开始了。
    西哈努克首相一开始就被空军战士们这超人的飞行技术表演吸引住了。首相仰望着天空，用手指着那一会儿飞入云霄、一会儿出现在半空做着分列式表演的四架银燕，对坐在他两旁的贺龙副总理和陈毅副总理连声称赞说；“训练很好，动作十分熟练！”
    两架新的喷气式银燕又出现在高空，这是双机编队特技表演。它们并肩前进，始终保持着二十公尺左右的距离。它们一忽儿出现在四千公尺以上的云际，一忽儿又俯冲到离地面只有几十公尺的低空。它们一起上升，一起俯冲，又一起上下左右翻着跟斗。技术之熟练已达到炉火纯青的地步，表演之自如，有如燕子一样的灵活。西哈努克首相的视线一直跟着这两架飞机转动。他不时地赞美说：“好，好极了，表演得太完美了！”
    不大一会儿，又有两架飞机在低空掠过。飞机经过的地方冒起了白烟，接着传来了隆隆的爆炸声响。空军副司令员王秉璋中将告诉首相：“这是打地靶表演。”这个空军师的师长赵沛章上校向首相介绍说：“这种飞机的杀伤面积很广。遇到敌人的炮兵阵地或坦克阵地扫射一次，就可以把它全部摧毁！”这时西哈努克首相举起望远镜仔细观察了冒白烟的地方。
    最精彩的是我国自制的飞机所作的单机快速表演了。这架飞机在跑道上只跑了很短的一段路就腾空而起，直入四五千公尺的云间，它旋转直上，翻滚再翻滚，高飞再高飞。西哈努克首相观看得那样的有兴趣，他连连叫好，不停地拍手。
    接着是空军战士和业余运动员的跳伞表演。首相非常赞扬他们跳伞的技术，说他们“训练有素，表演动人”。
    在观看表演的时候，西哈努克首相曾关怀地问到我国空军战士训练的情况，陈毅副总理说：“我们的空军是在朝鲜战场上训练出来的。”贺龙副总理笑着对首相说：“美国帝国主义当了我们的‘老师’，它教会了我们。”
    “我们的空军战士都是工农子弟，他们热爱祖国，对人民有深厚的感情。他们肯学习，能钻研，接受先进技术很快。他们坚强勇敢！”陈毅副总理又进一步向首相介绍着。
    “我们的空军战士的最大特点就是勇敢！”贺龙副总理也插了一句话。
    “我知道，远在朝鲜战争的年代，中国空军战士的英勇斗争精神就已经名闻全世界了！”西哈努克首相钦佩地说。
    这时，参加飞行表演的空军战士们和业余跳伞运动员一起，列队来到西哈努克首相的面前。首相在同这些年青的战士们会见的时候，是那样的兴奋和激动。他对这群年青的战士们说：“我们很感谢你们卓越的表演。我们很钦佩你们的纯熟的飞行技术，你们是我们学习的榜样。你们都是优秀的青年，你们和中国青年在一起共同建设和保卫你们自己的国家。在朝鲜战争中，你们已经名闻全世界了，你们的勇敢作为和英勇斗争的精神，很多人都知道。”
    在一阵热烈的掌声平息以后，首相又说：“我们来自一个和中国友好的国家。我们的友谊已经有了一千多年的历史。我们很高兴地看到，我们能依靠你们的超人技术和勇敢来保卫我们共同的自由和和平！”
    首相的这些充满友谊激情的话语，又一次获得了战士们的热烈掌声。
    接着，陈毅副总理十分高兴地对战士们说：“今天西哈努克首相看了表演以后，对你们的评价很高。你们要加紧锻炼，祖国的安全依靠着你们，你们一定要完成祖国交给你们的任务！中柬友好万岁！”
    这时，贺龙副总理对首相说：“我们强大的空军就是为了保卫世界和平，特别是保卫亚洲和平的！”
    “对！你们在保卫正义！正义一定胜利！”首相兴奋地说。（附图片）
