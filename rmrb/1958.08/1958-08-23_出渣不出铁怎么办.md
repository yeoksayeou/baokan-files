　　What to Do When Slag Comes Out But No Iron?
　　Fu Fuzhu
　　Some small blast furnaces are forced to shut down in less than a day, or even a few hours, after starting to smelt iron. This is often due to slag coming out without iron, or because of slag-iron setting at the bottom, causing the hearth to freeze. The reason for these phenomena is often due to improper start-up. So, how can we do a good job in starting up the furnace?

　　Attention to Furnace Loading
　　Loading the furnace is done layer by layer from the bottom up. Workers load the furnace from the inside and then come out from the top.

　　When loading the furnace, first spread a layer of about twenty millimeters of coal powder (coke powder is also acceptable) as filler at the bottom and around the inner walls of the hearth (below the tuyeres) to prevent the first molten slag from sticking to the bottom or the hearth walls after start-up. The coal powder or coke powder should be mixed with foul oil or coal tar. If there is no foul oil or coal tar locally, fire-resistant mud water can be used. It is suitable if you grab a handful, squeeze it tightly in your hand, and then release your hand and the coal powder does not scatter freely. If it is too wet, it will contain too much water, which will make it impossible to raise the hearth temperature temporarily; if it is too dry, it will not stick to the furnace walls. Then, spread a thin layer of wood shavings on the bottom, and then load firewood up to the upper part of the belly of the furnace (for a 1.5 cubic meter blast furnace, load 200 jin of firewood). The firewood below and at the tuyeres should be smaller so that it is easy to ignite. Also, stuff wood shavings into the firewood at the tuyeres as "kindling" when igniting. Then, load anthracite (if smelting iron with coke, then load coke) until it is full (about 800 to 1,000 jin for a 1.5 cubic meter blast furnace). When loading coal, it should be loaded layer by layer, each layer about 300 millimeters thick, and the sizes of the lumps should be evenly distributed. It should not be pressed too tightly, and there should be places for air to pass through. Some limestone should be loaded separately on the upper layers, but not too much.

　　Ignition and Air Supply
　　Open the tuyeres, iron notch, and slag notch. Insert pre-heated iron rods into the wood shavings from the tuyeres (light the fire from several tuyeres at the same time). Let the wood shavings burn. After the firewood is also lit, the iron rods can be pulled out (if it is found that the firewood is burning unevenly or not vigorously enough in the furnace, it can be ignited again from the iron notch or slag notch using the same method). Generally speaking, it is not desirable to ignite at the iron notch or slag notch, because it is found that there is uneven burning, or even that the iron notch and slag notch burn too quickly, while the firewood in other places has not yet burned out, so that the furnace charge is unevenly descending. Let the tuyeres, iron notch, and slag notch freely draw air to supply the firewood to burn and ignite the coal, that is, when the smoke coming out of the top of the furnace changes from mixed black to bluish-white (this phenomenon indicates that the firewood has burned through and caused the coal to burn), then close the tuyere cover. For blast furnaces with slag notches, seal the slag notch. Then, slowly supply air. The iron notch is still open, allowing the unburned charcoal to be blown out of the iron notch. After blowing for about ten minutes, block the iron notch with hard round firewood, and then cover the firewood with a layer of coal powder mud. At this time, load the furnace according to the prescribed initial batch of furnace charge. When we produced on a 1.5 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace, we manually poured the ore at 20 jin, pig iron at 5 jin, limestone at 10 jin, and anthracite at 40 jin, layer by layer into the furnace, and used iron rakes to evenly distribute the furnace charge (normal charging for a 1.5 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace is ore 30 to 35 jin, limestone 20 to 22 jin, pig iron 5 jin, and anthracite 60 to 65 jin).

　　Because it is impossible to blow out all the charcoal at once, depending on the size of the small blast furnace, the iron notch should be opened every half hour or hour to allow the charcoal to be blown out. At the same time, iron hooks can be used to help blow out the charcoal. It is necessary to find a way to blow out the charcoal before the molten slag descends to the hearth. But be careful not to use the iron hook too hard, just hook out the charcoal block that is blocking the iron notch, because if the iron hook is used too hard, it is easy to cause the incompletely burned coal blocks to fall into the hearth, which may be wrapped by the descending molten slag, causing the slag to set at the bottom and causing the hearth to freeze.

　　Several Things to Note
　　Generally, small blast furnaces have relatively small hearths, and the building materials used are all locally sourced, with poor fire resistance and insulation. In addition, the furnace building technology cannot be as strict as that of large blast furnaces. At the same time, the furnace bases of small blast furnaces are mostly built with large stones, and no measures are taken to prevent surface water and groundwater at all. Therefore, the hearth is easily cooled down or it is not easy to raise the hearth temperature. Therefore, it is not advisable to rush to load the official furnace charge into the furnace when loading the furnace, nor is it advisable to supply air immediately after ignition, because supplying air after ignition easily causes the firewood to burn out quickly, while the anthracite has not yet had time to ignite (the same goes for coke). This not only does not provide enough time to heat the hearth temperature, but on the contrary will cause unburned or incompletely burned coal blocks to fall into the hearth. Since there is not enough air supply for combustion in the lower part of the hearth, it will not only fail to continue to increase the hearth temperature, but on the contrary will absorb some heat, causing the hearth temperature to become cold, especially after rushing to load the furnace charge into the furnace too early, it is very likely that unmelted raw materials will fall into the hearth, making it impossible to melt in the hearth. Even if it is melted, it will not be fully reduced, thus creating a liquid with high viscosity and indistinguishable slag and iron. In this case of low hearth temperature, the phenomenon of setting at the bottom and freezing of the hearth occurs, and serious development can only be forced to stop the furnace.

　　After the furnace is started, when starting to load the furnace, do not make the batch of charge too heavy. It is best to produce with light batches for a relatively long time, and then gradually increase the batch of charge according to the furnace conditions. In the initial stage of starting the furnace, some scrap iron should be used as the furnace charge at the time of starting the furnace, and less ore should be loaded, because the temperature in the furnace is very low when the furnace is first started, especially in the hearth. Therefore, a higher proportion of fuel is conducive to increasing the furnace temperature. In particular, a batch of charge that is too heavy is not suitable for the situation of small blast furnaces, because the furnace is small, and if too much charge is loaded at one time, the furnace charge will not have enough time and stroke to melt and reduce it. Therefore, it is also easy for raw materials to fall into the hearth. In this way, not only iron cannot be smelted, but also the phenomenon of hearth freezing or setting at the bottom will occur.

　　All blast furnaces, large and small, are required to load according to a certain prescribed material level and do not want to use too low a material level for a long time. Because if the furnace is not loaded according to the specified material level, the temperature in the furnace will become hot and cold due to the loading being sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, and serious hanging material and caving material accidents will often occur. If the hanging material lasts for a long time, the wind pressure will suddenly increase, reducing the amount of air sent into the furnace, and the furnace will also become cold. If the caving material is serious, it will also cause raw materials to fall into the hearth, causing the results mentioned earlier.

　　If a too low material level is adopted for too long, especially for small blast furnaces that use anthracite to smelt iron, on the one hand, heat will run to the upper part of the blast furnace, which will not only cause the hearth to become cold, but also easily cause nodulation accidents. On the other hand, even if no nodulation occurs, the iron that has been reduced too early will be oxidized into ferric oxide again, causing it to return to the hearth for direct reduction, absorbing the temperature of the hearth and causing the hearth to become cold. At the same time, when the material level is too deep, the correct distribution of the furnace charge will be destroyed, causing a large amount of ore to roll along the furnace wall towards the center of the furnace, causing the ore to accumulate in the center of the furnace. This directly affects the ventilation, causing unmelted ore to fall into the hearth and cause accidents.

　　In particular, small blast furnaces that use anthracite to smelt iron require stricter requirements for the particle size of anthracite. Its particle size should be between 25 and 75 millimeters. If it is too small, the air permeability of the blast furnace will be poor. If it is too large, the thermal stability will be poor.

　　After igniting and supplying air to the furnace, the unburned charcoal must be blown out of the hearth. If there are still charcoal blocks left in the hearth, the slag will wrap the charcoal when it enters the hearth, which will not only prevent the slag from flowing out, but may also roll larger and larger, closing the hearth and causing setting at the bottom and freezing of the hearth, or the iron notch and slag notch cannot be opened.

　　In short, the technology of operating small blast furnaces is easy to learn, but don't take it too simply. In particular, the starting operation is more difficult to master than large blast furnaces. In addition, if you want to enable the small blast furnace to smoothly enter normal production after starting the furnace, you must pay special attention to the charging operation, and you must try to make the batch weight "accurate" over the scale, and the material distribution into the furnace should be "even", do not distribute the material to one side, or make the large and small pieces pile up in one place separately. And it must be done "steadily", that is, implement exploration of the material level according to the prescribed material level and charge frequently. If you are not careful, you will bring production failures to the furnace within one or two hours.

　　Explanation: ① This article is based on the experience gained in the production practice of using anthracite to smelt iron in a 1.5 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace at the Yingchao Iron Industry Cooperative in Yangcheng, Shanxi.

　　② Batch of charge—the weight of the materials loaded into the furnace at one time, including ore, limestone, and anthracite.

　　③ Material level—refers to the depth of the furnace charge descending during smelting (from the uppermost part of the throat as the starting point).

　　④ Hanging material—the phenomenon that the furnace charge hangs in the body of the furnace and does not fall.

　　⑤ Caving material—is caused by hanging material, that is, after hanging material, or the amount of furnace charge in the upper part continues to increase, or the wind pressure in the furnace decreases, then the hanging furnace charge will fall by itself, which is called caving material.

　　⑥ Nodulation—the ore and limestone melt too early in the upper part of the blast furnace and stick too much to the furnace wall and cannot come down, which is called nodulation. (Attached picture)

　　出渣不出铁怎么办
　　傅辅珠
    有些地方的小高炉，开始炼铁不到一天，甚至几小时，就被迫停炉，多是因为出渣不出铁，或是因为产生渣铁坐底，使炉缸冻结。产生这些现象的原因，多是因为开炉不当造成的。那么，如何才能做好开炉工作呢？
    装炉要注意
    装炉是由下往上一层一层的，工人在炉里装，装完由炉顶出来。
    装炉的时候，首先在炉底和炉缸内墙四周（风口下）捣一层约二十公厘的煤粉（焦粉也可）做为填料，以防止开炉后第一次熔渣粘底或粘炉缸墙。煤粉或焦粉要和臭油或焦油调在一起，当地没有臭油和焦油的，可用耐火泥水。调合后用手抓一把，在手中捏紧，再松开手而煤粉不自由散开，就算合适。太湿了因含水太多，会使炉缸温度一时提不高；太干了又粘不住炉墙。然后在炉底铺上薄薄一层木刨花，再装架木柴至炉腹上部（一点五立方公尺的高炉装木柴二百市斤），在下面和风口处的木柴要小一些的，这样就容易点着，还要在风口处把木刨花塞在柴内，点火时做为“引火”。接着再装无烟煤（若炼铁用焦炭的就装焦炭），一直装满（一点五立方公尺高炉约装八百至一千市斤）。装煤时是一层一层装，每层约三百公厘左右，大小块度要均匀分布，不要压紧，要有透气的地方，在上面几层要分别装一些石灰石，但不要太多。
    点火与送风
    风口、铁口、渣口都打开将预先烧红了的铁钎由风口内插进木刨花内（有几个风口就同时由几个风口内点火）让木刨花燃烧起来。等木柴也已点着后，就可以把铁钎抽出来（若发现炉内木柴烧得不均，或不旺时，可由铁口或渣口处用同样方法再点）。一般情况不希望在铁口或渣口点火，因为发现有偏烧的现象，甚至发现铁口渣口处烧得太快，而其他地方木柴尚未烧完，以致使炉料发生偏下现象；由风口、铁口、渣口自由吸风，供木柴燃烧，并把煤点着即看到炉顶冒出的烟由混黑转为青白色（此现象说明木柴已烧透并引起煤在燃烧），这时再关上风口盖，有渣口的高炉要封住渣口，然后，再慢慢送风。铁口仍旧开着，让未烧完的木炭由铁口内吹出来，约吹十分钟后，再用硬圆木柴堵住铁口，木柴外堵上一层煤粉泥。这时应按规定的开炉初期的料批上料。我们在一点五立方公尺的土高炉上生产时是按矿石二十市斤，毛铁五市斤，石灰石十市斤，无烟煤四十市斤的先后次序一层一层的用人工倒入炉内，并用铁钯使炉料布置均匀（一点五立方公尺土高炉正常上料是矿石三十至三十五市斤，石灰石二十至二十二斤，毛铁五斤，无烟煤六十至六十五市斤）。
    因木炭不可能一次就能全部吹出来，所以要根据小高炉的大小，采取每隔半小时或一小时再将铁口打开让木炭吹出来，同时可用铁钩帮助木炭吹出来，必须设法在熔渣没有下至炉缸前将木炭吹净。但千万不要使用铁钩过猛，只要把堵住铁口的木炭块钩出就可以了，因为使用铁钩过猛时，容易使没有完全燃烧的煤块落到炉缸里，可能会被下来的熔渣包住，而使炉渣坐底，出现炉缸冻结现象。
    值得注意的几件事
    一般小高炉由于炉缸比较小，使用建筑材料都是就地取材，耐火度和保温程度都比较差，并在砌炉技术上又不可能像大高炉那样要求严格，同时，小高炉炉基多用大块石砌成，根本不作什么防止地表水和地下水的措施，所以，炉缸容易变凉，或不易提高炉缸温度。因此不宜在装炉时，急于把正式炉料装进炉里，也不宜在一点火之后，马上就送风，因为点火之后就送风，容易使木柴很快烧掉，而无烟煤却还来不及点着（焦炭也一样），这样不但没有足够的时间来加热炉缸温度，相反的会使没有燃着的或没有烧透的煤块落入炉缸内，由于炉缸下部没有足够的空气供给燃烧，所以不但不能达到继续提高炉缸温度的作用，相反的还要吸收一部分热量，使炉缸温度变冷，特别在急于将炉料过早装入炉内之后，很可能使没有熔化的生炉料落入炉缸内，使之在炉缸内不能熔化，即使是熔化了，也得不到充分还原，因之造成粘度很大的渣铁不分的液体，在炉缸温度不高的这种情况下，就产生坐底和炉缸冻结现象，严重的发展只有被迫停炉。
    开炉生产后，开始上料时，千万不可使料批太重，最好轻料批生产一个较长的时间后，再根据炉子情况逐步加重料批。开炉初期，应该多使用一些废铁作为开炉时炉料，少装一些矿石，因刚开炉时，炉内温度很低，特别是炉缸，所以燃料的比例高一些，有利于提高炉子温度，特别是料批太重，这是不适应于小高炉的情况的，因为炉子小，若一时上料太多，便使炉料没有足够的时间和行程来使之熔化与还原，因此也易使生炉料落入炉缸，这样，不仅炼不出铁来，还会造成炉缸冻结或坐底现象。
    无论大小高炉都要求按一定的规定料线上料，并不希望有较长的时间采用过低的料线操作。因为不按规定的料线装料，炉内温度会依着装料的忽多忽少忽快忽慢而变成忽冷忽热，严重的会常发生悬料和崩料事故，悬料时间长了，会使风压骤然增加，使送进炉内的风量减少，也会使炉子变凉；若崩料严重时，也会使生炉料落入炉缸，造成前面说过的结果。
    若过长的时间采取过低的料线，特别是使用无烟煤炼铁的小高炉，一方面会使热量跑向高炉上部，不但会使炉缸变凉，也容易造成结瘤事故；另一方面即使不结瘤也会使还原过早的铁又会氧化成三氧化二铁，使之又回到炉缸内来直接还原而吸收炉缸的温度会使炉缸变凉。同时料线过深时，炉料的正确分布将被破坏，使大量的矿石沿着炉墙滚向炉子中心，使炉子中心矿石堆积，这就直接影响了通风，使没有被熔化的矿石落入炉缸造成事故。
    特别是小高炉采用无烟煤炼铁，对无烟煤的粒度要求需严格一些，其粒度应在二十五至七十五公厘之间，太小了会使高炉透气性不好；太大了，热稳定性不好。
    开炉点火送风后一定要将没有烧完的木炭由炉缸内吹出来，若仍有木炭块留在炉缸内，则炉渣进入炉缸后，便会把木炭裹起来，使渣不仅流不出来，还可能越滚越大使炉缸闭塞，造成坐底和炉缸冻结，或铁口与渣口打不开等现象。
    总之，对小高炉操作的技术学起来是容易，但千万不可把它看得太简单，特别是开炉操作比大高炉要难掌握一些。除此之外，如果要求使小高炉在开炉之后能很好的转入正常生产，对装料操作也要特别注意，必须尽可能做到料批重量过磅“准确”，向炉内布料要“均匀”，不要偏布料，或使大小块分别堆积在一处。并要做到上料“稳”，即按规定的料线实行勘探料线，勤上料。万一不小心就会在一、二小时内就给炉子带来生产上的故障。
    说明：①这篇文章是以一点五立方公尺土高炉用无烟煤炼铁在山西阳城应朝铁业社的生产实践中取得的经验。
    ②料批——是一次装进炉内重量，包括矿石、石灰石和无烟煤。
    ③料线——是指炉料在冶炼过程中下降的深度（由炉喉最上部作为起点）。
    ④悬料——是炉料悬在炉身部分不下落的现象。
    ⑤崩料——是由于悬料而产生的，即悬料之后，或上部炉料继续增多，或炉内风压减低，则悬着的炉料自己会跌下来，叫崩料。
    ⑥结瘤——矿石和石灰石在高炉上部熔化过早，过多的粘住了炉墙，下不来就叫做结瘤。（附图片）
