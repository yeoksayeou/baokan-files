    Jishan Becomes an Advanced Sanitation County
    (Our dispatch) Jishan County, a well-known advanced sanitation county in Shanxi Province, has achieved brilliant results by persistently carrying out the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. In the past, the county had a sanitation model village, Taiyang Village. Now, the entire county has become like Taiyang Village, and the eight pests have been basically eradicated throughout the county. While vigorously carrying out the elimination of the four pests and emphasizing hygiene, they have also carried out disease eradication campaigns, which have not only improved the sanitary conditions, but also eliminated diseases such as relapsing fever, dysentery, typhoid fever, neonatal tetanus, and puerperal fever.
    The main measures that have enabled the county to maintain such good progress in the patriotic health campaign since the beginning of this year are: combining pupa digging with improving environmental sanitation, combining rat and sparrow catching with protecting seeds and preserving grain, combining weeding and mosquito elimination with pressing green manure and composting, combining labor protection with increasing attendance rate, and combining sanitation in animal husbandry with increasing livestock attendance rate. This approach starts from production, smoothly carries out sanitation work, and also promotes production. In addition, they have formulated patriotic sanitation covenants and cleaning systems, established sanitation supervision posts, sanitation inspection days, and systems of commendation and criticism. Measures such as setting up banners, organizing competitions, and conducting inspections and evaluations are also taken to ensure that the work can be carried out thoroughly and regularly.
    Jishan County has also carried out a nine-check (environment, family, individual, animal husbandry, culture, maternal and child health, four pests, greening, food) and eight-compare (township vs. township, commune vs. commune, village vs. village, team vs. team, household vs. household, person vs. person, livestock vs. livestock, unit vs. unit) competition campaign, which has enabled the sanitation campaign to deepen step by step and persist.
    The success of the county's work in eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene is also largely due to the publicity and education work. For example, in March of this year, the masses had developed a sense of complacency and negativity. After discovering this situation, the leading departments immediately organized a sanitation leap forward conference and a conference of sanitation activists, criticized right-leaning conservatism, and summarized the experiences of advanced units, thereby further arousing the masses to a high tide of the movement.

    稷山成了卫生先进县
    本报讯  山西省著名的卫生先进县——稷山县，坚持开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，已经取得了辉煌的成绩。这个县过去有一个卫生模范村——太阳村，现在全县都已像太阳村那样了，八害已在全县范围内基本绝迹。由于在大力开展除四害讲卫生的同时开展了灭病运动，不仅使卫生面貌更加改观，而且消灭了回归热、痢疾、伤寒、新生儿四六风、产褥热等疾病。
    这个县今年以来所以能一直把爱国卫生运动做得很好，主要措施是：挖蛹与改善环境卫生相结合，捕鼠灭雀与保种保粮相结合，除草灭蚊与压青沤肥相结合，劳动保护与提高出勤率相结合，饲养卫生与牲畜出勤率相结合。这样从生产出发，顺利地开展了卫生工作，同时也推动了生产。另外，还制定爱国卫生公约与清扫制度，建立卫生监督岗，卫生检查日，表扬与批评的制度。并采取树立旗帜，组织竞赛，检查评比等措施，以保证工作能深入和经常化。
    稷山县还由于开展了九查（环境、家庭、个人、饲养、文化、妇幼、四害、绿化、食品）和八比（乡与乡、社与社、村与村、队与队、户与户、人与人、牲口与牲口、单位与单位）的竞赛运动，使卫生运动步步深入，坚持下去。
    这个县的除四害讲卫生工作所以做得好，宣传教育工作也起了很大作用。例如今年3月，群众就曾产生了自满消极情绪。领导部门发现这种情况后，即组织了卫生跃进会，卫生积极分子大会，批判右倾保守，总结先进单位的经验，从而使群众进一步掀起了运动高潮。
