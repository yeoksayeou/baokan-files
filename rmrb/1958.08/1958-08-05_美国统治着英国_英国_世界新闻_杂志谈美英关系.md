Xinhua News Agency, London, August 2nd (TASS) -- The British "World News" magazine published an article by Williamson titled "America Rules Britain." The author wrote: "Britain today is increasingly losing its economic, political, and military independence." When discussing the relationship between the United States and Britain, Williamson emphasized that the United States does not appear as a "good neighbor," but as "a resident of this house, occupying all the best rooms." He wrote: "This is a euphemistic way of describing the essence of American interference in British political and economic affairs and Britain's subservience to American imperialist policies."

The author said that the "so-called Anglo-American alliance" is the cause of this situation, and the reason for forming this alliance is to "defend British imperialism."

Williamson emphasized that the United States regards Britain as a "country that can be exploited endlessly." He said: "Initially, the United States regarded Britain as an unsinkable aircraft carrier, and now it regards it as a missile base for the first line of American defense."

The author then talked about the impact of this situation on the British economy. He said that a large part of the British budget is used to maintain the American troops stationed in Britain and to build missile launch sites. Its military expenditure far exceeds that of West Germany, France, and Italy. The author then pointed out that Britain has suffered huge losses due to American interference in British trade with socialist countries. At the same time, American capital continues to "infiltrate" Britain. According to "The Times," in 1956 alone, American direct investment in Britain reached 570 million pounds, mainly concentrated in the processing and oil industries. Now, American goods are increasingly appearing on the British market. The author finally emphasized that the American recession has an adverse effect on the British economic situation. He quoted the "Financial Times" as saying that people have begun to believe that "the United States cannot guarantee rapid and continuous economic development like communist countries."

    “美国统治着英国”
    英国“世界新闻”杂志谈美英关系
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社伦敦2日讯：英国“世界新闻”杂志刊登了威廉逊的题为“美国统治着英国”的文章。作者写道：“英国今天越来越多地失去自己的经济、政治和军事独立。”威廉逊在谈到英美两国的关系时强调指出，美国不是以“善邻”的姿态出现，而是以“这所房子的住客的姿态出现，并且占用着所有最好的房间”。他写道：“这是对美国干涉英国的政治和经济事务的实质以及对英国屈从美国的帝国主义政策的一种婉转的说法。”
    作者说，“所谓英美联盟”是造成这种局势的原因，而所以要结成这种联盟，是为了“保卫英帝国主义”。
    威廉逊强调指出，美国把英国看作是一个“可以无止境地利用的国家”。他说：“最初美国把英国当作一艘不沉的航空母舰，现在又把它当作美国第一道防线的导弹基地。”
    作者接着谈到这种情况对英国经济的影响。他说，英国的预算有很大一部分用来维持驻在英国的美军和建筑导弹发射场。它的军事开支大大超过了西德、法国和意大利。作者接着指出，由于美国干涉英国同社会主义国家的贸易，英国遭受了巨大的损失。同时，美国资本又继续“渗入”英国。根据“泰晤士报”的材料，仅仅在1956年一年美国对英国的直接投资就达到五亿七千万英镑，而且主要是集中在加工工业和石油工业方面。现在，在英国市场上，美国货已经越来越多。作者最后强调指出，美国的衰退对英国经济状况起着不良影响。他引“金融时报”的话说，各国人民已经开始相信，“美国不能像共产主义国家那样保证经济得到迅速和不断的发展”。
