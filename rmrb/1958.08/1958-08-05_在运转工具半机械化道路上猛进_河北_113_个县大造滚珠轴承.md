Forging Ahead on the Road to Semi-Mechanization of Operating Tools
113 Counties in Hebei Province Mass-Produce Ball Bearings

    According to the Hebei Daily, as of August 2nd, 113 out of the 162 counties and cities in Hebei Province have produced ball bearings for various operating tools. Many areas have achieved having ball bearing factories in every township and every cooperative. Various locations have already manufactured 168,450 sets of ball bearings. In Handan Prefecture, the main operating tools (waterwheels, iron carts, handcarts, double-wheeled double-share plows, weeding machines, slicing machines, stone rollers, stone mills) in 11 counties and cities including Handan City, Xingtai City, Pingxiang, Baixiang, Nangong, Wei County, Qinghe, Handan, Shahe, Daming, and Xingtai County have basically achieved ball bearing implementation.

    Since the mass movement to manufacture ball bearings began, production efficiency and quality have been improving daily. In Handan Prefecture, at the beginning, only a few dozen sets of ball bearings could be produced each day. By July 28th, the daily production had reached 400,858 balls and more than 10,000 sets of bearings.

    The quality of ball bearings produced in various locations is also improving daily. The balls made in Xingtai City have been tested and can meet the standard of Tianjin's Lion brand. The 6208 bearings made by the Ningjin County Iron Factory can rotate 1,500 revolutions per minute, which is equivalent to the quality of Worker brand bearings.

    In order to support the early realization of ball bearing implementation in rural areas, commercial departments in various parts of Hebei Province are providing strong support. The Tianjin Municipal Commercial Department has decided to supply each county with a set of machines for producing ball bearings, so that the counties can replace manual production with machines. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, each county's commercial department has a director personally in charge of this work, and has drawn all technical personnel from subordinate units and factories to go deep into rural areas to widely impart technology. Employees of the commercial departments have also expressed their guarantee to meet the supply of raw materials, putting forward "supply as much as needed, supply whatever is needed, deliver wherever it is needed." The Baoding Municipal Commercial Department has also drawn up diagrams of the production process of ball bearings and distributed them to various counties to help them produce.

    At present, all prefectures have formulated plans for realizing the ball bearing implementation of operating tools. Tangshan Prefecture has proposed to achieve ball bearing implementation before the end of August. Shijiazhuang Prefecture has put forward the slogan "One day for preparation, two days for finished products, rapid promotion in all aspects, and strive to basically achieve the ball bearing implementation of operating tools before August 15th." Chengde Prefecture strives to achieve ball bearing implementation by mid-September. Some counties are even more energetic. Zhengding, Luancheng, and Pingshan have proposed: Work hard for ten days, and guarantee that all ball bearing implementation will be achieved before August 10th, and strive to be the first in the province.

    在运转工具半机械化道路上猛进
    河北113个县大造滚珠轴承
    据河北日报消息　河北省一百六十二个县市中，截至8月2日止，已有一百一十三个县制出各种运转工具的滚珠轴承。许多地区已做到乡乡、社社有滚珠轴承工厂。各地已制出滚珠轴承十六万八千四百五十套。邯郸专区的邯郸市、邢台市、平乡、柏乡、南宫、威县、清河、邯郸、沙河、大名、邢台县等十一个县市的主要运转工具（水车、铁车、手工车、双轮双铧犁、锄草机、切片机、石碾、石磨）已基本实现滚珠轴承化。
    群众性的制造滚珠轴承运动开展起来以后，生产效率和质量已日渐提高。邯郸专区开始时每日只能生产几十套滚珠轴承，至7月28日止，已能日产滚珠四十万零八千五百八十八个，轴承一万多套。
    各地制出的滚珠轴承质量也日益提高，邢台市制成的滚珠，经过试验可达到天津狮球牌标准。宁津县铁厂制成的六二○八轴承，每分钟可转一千五百转，与工人牌轴承质量相等。
    为了支援农村早日实现滚珠轴承化，河北省各地商业部门大力进行支援。天津市商业部门决定供应每县一套生产滚珠轴承的机器，使各县用机器代替手工生产。石家庄专区各县商业部门均有一名局长亲自抓这一工作，并从所属单位和工厂中抽出全部技术人员，深入农村广泛进行技术传授。商业部门职工并表示保证满足原料供应，提出“需要多少，供应多少，需要什么，供应什么，那里需要，送到那里”。保定市商业部门还把滚珠轴承的生产制造过程绘成图纸，分送各县，帮助各县生产。
    目前各专区均已定出了实现运转工具滚珠轴承化的规划。唐山专区提出在8月底以前实现滚珠轴承化，石家庄专区提出“一天作准备、两天出成品、迅速推广全面、争取8月15日前基本实现运转工具滚珠轴承化”的口号，承德专区争取在9月中旬实现滚珠轴承化。有些县的劲头更足，正定、栾城、平山提出：大干十天，保证在8月10日以前全部实现滚珠轴承化，力争全省第一。（附图片）
