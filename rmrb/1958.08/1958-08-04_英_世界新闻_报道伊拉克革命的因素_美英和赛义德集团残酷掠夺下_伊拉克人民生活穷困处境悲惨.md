Xinhua News Agency, 1st, London: The British "World News" published an article on July 26th entitled "Factors of the Iraqi Uprising," exposing the cruel exploitation of the Iraqi people by the U.S. and British oil monopoly capital and the Faisal-Said feudal comprador group. The article also described the miserable plight of the Iraqi working people under the Said regime.

The article stated that British conservatives and some right-wing Labour leaders have praised Nuri al-Said for using a substantial portion of the government's oil tax revenue for economic development. This is a complete distortion of the actual situation.

The article said that the first development plan of the Development Board, implemented in 1952, stipulated an expenditure of £100 million. However, at the end of the fourth year, only one-third of this amount had been spent, and all of the expenditure was used for irrigation and flood control. The new plan implemented in 1956 stipulated an expenditure of £500 million over six years, of which one-third was used for dams and levees, only 2.8% for agricultural development, 2% for public health, and 1.3% for educational facilities. The article said that, in other words, the main beneficiaries of these public fund expenditures were the general feudal landlords, who did not even pay property taxes.

The article said that the farmers did not get any benefit, and they still lived in poverty and misery. The Said regime did not take any steps to implement land reform.

The article said that the Iraqi people lived in miserable straits, but the Iraqi Said regime spent more than £10 million to build a palace for King Faisal and his bride-to-be, and used more than £50,000 to set up fountains in the palace garden.

The article said, please compare this situation with the situation of the peasants and the working class. The average annual cash income of the peasants, who make up the vast majority of Iraq's six million people, is £7 and 10 shillings. The average weekly wage of workers is from £1 to £1 and 5 shillings. In private manufacturing plants, the average weekly wage of skilled workers is from £1 and 10 shillings to £2. Since 1939, the cost of living has increased fivefold.

The article said that illiteracy among men is 80%, and among women is 90%. Less than 20% of children attend school. There is one doctor for every 6,000 people, one dentist for every 500,000 people, one nurse for every 300,000 people, and one hospital bed for every 1,000 people.

The article said that under the Said regime, there was no form of social insurance, unemployment relief, health care, or pensions at all, except for a small number of government civil servants. Trade unions and peasant organizations were illegal. Every attempt to improve living standards was met with severe repression. As a result, thousands of people died from malnutrition.

The article said that even the former Pakistani Minister of Education and Health, Zahiruddin, had to admit when speaking at a meeting of the Baghdad Pact countries' "Social Committee" eighteen months ago: "In this region, the number of malnourished people has increased from 35% to 56% in the past few years, and the number of lung disease patients is increasing, equivalent to four times that of European countries."

The article said that the Iraq Petroleum Company is one of the nine major oil trusts dominated by U.S. and British capital that occupy a dominant position in the Middle East. Before the British aggression against Suez, its profit in 1955 was £80 million. The British adventure in Suez and the cutting of the pipeline caused the company's output to decline and profits to decrease in 1956, but it is expected that output will soon return to the level before the British aggression against Suez, and profits will reach £80 million again.

The article said that the total number of Iraqi oil workers is only 12,000, and even if profits have declined in the past two years, each person produces a profit of £4,500 per year! It is true that the Iraq Petroleum Company also makes some profits from exploiting workers in other Arab oil-producing countries, but most of its profits are obtained in Iraq. Even if this profit is only £2,000 produced by each worker, this will still be equal to twenty times the wages paid to oil workers!

    英“世界新闻”报道伊拉克革命的因素
    美英和赛义德集团残酷掠夺下  伊拉克人民生活穷困处境悲惨
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：英国“世界新闻”7月26日刊载了一篇题为“伊拉克起义的因素”的文章，揭露了美英石油垄断资本和费萨尔—赛义德封建买办集团对伊拉克人民的残酷剥削。文章还描述了伊拉克劳动人民在赛义德政权下的悲惨处境。
    文章说，英国保守党人和一些工党右翼领导人曾经赞扬努里·赛义德把政府的石油税收的一个相当大部分用于经济发展。这是对实际情况的十足的歪曲。
    文章说，1952年开始实行的开发委员会的第一个开发计划曾规定开支为一亿镑，但是，在第四年结束时，只花了这笔数目的三分之一，所花去的费用全部用于灌溉和防洪。1956年实行的新计划规定在六年的时间里支出五亿镑，其中三分之一是用于修水坝和堤防，只有2.8％是用于农业发展，2％用于公共卫生，1.3％用于教育设施。文章说，换句话说，这些公共基金的开支的主要受益人是一般封建地主，他们是连财产税也不付的。
    文章说，农民们并没有得到什么好处，他们仍然过着穷困和悲惨的生活。赛义德政权并没有采取任何步骤来实行土地改革。
    文章说，伊拉克的人民生活在悲惨的困境中，可是，伊拉克的赛义德政权却花了一千多万镑为国王费萨尔和他准备迎娶的新娘修建了一座王宫，用五万多镑在王宫花园里设置喷水池。
    文章说，请把这种情况同农民和工人阶级的情况比一比吧。在伊拉克六百万人口中占绝大部分的农民平均每年的现金收入是七镑十先令。工人的每周平均工资从一镑到一镑五先令。在私营制造厂，熟练工人每周平均工资是一镑十先令到两镑。自从1939年以来，生活费用上涨了五倍。
    文章说，在男人中文盲占80％，在妇女中占90％。上学的儿童不到20％。每六千人才有一个医生，每五十万人才有一个牙医师，每三十万人才有一个护士，每一千人才有一张医院病床。
    文章说，在赛义德政权下，除了少数政府公务人员外，根本就没有任何形式的社会保险、失业救济、保健和养老金。工会和农民组织都是非法的。每个想提高生活水平的企图，都遭到严厉的压制。这一切的结果是，数以千计的人们由于营养不良而夭折。
    文章说，甚至连前巴基斯坦教育和卫生部长扎希鲁丁在十八个月以前在巴格达条约国家的“社会委员会”会议上发言时也不得不承认：“在这个地区中，营养不良的人数在过去几年中已从35％增加到了56％，肺病患者人数正在增加，相当于欧洲国家的四倍。”
    文章说，伊拉克石油公司是在中东占有统治地位的以美英资本为主的九大石油托辣斯之一。在英国侵略苏伊士以前，它在1955年的利润是八千万英镑。英国的苏伊士的冒险和油管的切断使得这家公司在1956年的产量下降，利润也降低，但是预料产量不久将恢复到英国侵略苏伊士以前的水平，而利润再度达到八千万英镑。
    文章说，伊拉克石油工人总数只不过是一万二千人，即使在过去两年中利润下降，每年每人也生产利润四千五百英镑！伊拉克石油公司还从剥削其他的阿拉伯产油国家的工人中得到一些利润，这是事实，但是它的大部分利润是在伊拉克得到的。即使这种利润只是每个工人生产两千英镑，这将仍然等于付给石油工人的工资的二十倍！
