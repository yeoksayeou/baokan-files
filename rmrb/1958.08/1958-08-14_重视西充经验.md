　　Emphasize the Experience of Xichong
    Chairman Mao, during his inspection of Xushui, asked everyone to consider what to do with excess grain. This is a new problem that has been timely raised before the people of the whole country.

    This year's unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture is certain. How to properly handle the harvested grain, especially the high-yielding and easily perishable tuber crops, is a major task in current rural work. It is not only related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, but also has a significant meaning in encouraging the peasants' enthusiasm to continue the Great Leap Forward. The example of Xichong County in Sichuan can illustrate that, faced with the unprecedented bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, which account for more than half of the county's total grain output, the peasants were both happy and worried. They were happy about the bumper harvest, but worried that so many sweet potatoes could not be processed.

    Seeing this situation, the leading departments of Xichong County promptly made plans to completely process more than 2 billion jin of sweet potatoes locally by means of storage and preservation, comprehensive processing and utilization, and increased consumption. After these measures were announced, the peasants' ideological concerns were dispelled, and their enthusiasm was even higher. The experience of Xichong County deserves attention from all parts of the country. It is hoped that the agricultural, industrial, grain, commercial, and scientific departments will vigorously cooperate to jointly solve this new problem.

　　重视西充经验
    毛主席视察徐水时要大家考虑粮食多了怎么办，这是及时提到全国人民面前的一个新问题。
    今年农业空前大丰收是肯定的了，妥善地处理丰收的粮食，特别是产量极大而又易腐烂的薯类作物，是当前农村工作中一件大事。它不仅关系国计民生，而且对鼓舞农民继续大跃进的积极性有重大的意义。四川西充县的例子可以说明，农民们面对占全县粮食总产量一半以上的红苕的空前大丰收，一则以喜，一则以忧。喜的是丰收，忧的是这么多的红苕无法处理。
    西充县领导部门看到这种情况，及时作出规划，准备用收储保管、加工综合利用和增加食用等办法，全部就地处理二十多亿斤的红苕。这些措施公布以后，农民们的思想顾虑打消了，干劲也更高了。西充县的经验是值得全国各地重视的。希望农业、工业、粮食、商业、科学各部门大力协作，共同解决这个新问题。
