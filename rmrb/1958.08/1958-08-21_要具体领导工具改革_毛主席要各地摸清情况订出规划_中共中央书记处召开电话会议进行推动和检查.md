　　To Concretely Lead the Reform of Tools
　　Chairman Mao Wants All Regions to Ascertain the Situation and Formulate Plans
　　The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Convenes a Telephone Conference to Promote and Inspect
　　(Our Newspaper Dispatch) After the CPC Central Committee and the State Council jointly issued instructions on rapidly launching a farm tool improvement movement in rural areas on July 13th, the tool improvement movement has become even more enthusiastic across the country. In order to further promote the development of this movement and inspect problems in the movement, the Central Secretariat recently convened two telephone conferences for provincial party secretaries. The two meetings were presided over by Comrade Peng Zhen and Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretaries of the Central Secretariat, respectively.
　　At the first meeting, in addition to continuing to implement the spirit of the joint instructions from the Central Committee and the State Council, it was further pointed out that the tool improvement movement is the central issue in current agricultural production in China, and all local party committees are required to particularly strengthen their leadership over this movement. Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out at the meeting: The ball bearing conversion of rotating tools is the main link in the current tool improvement movement, and it is the fundamental symbol of China's agricultural production moving towards semi-mechanization. Leading comrades in all regions should seize this main link, mobilize the broad masses, and launch a tool improvement movement that combines creation, invention and popularization, with ball bearing conversion as the center.
　　Chairman Mao was very concerned about the tool improvement movement. After the telephone conference, he specifically asked Comrade Tan Zhenlin for detailed information about the progress of the movement. Chairman Mao expressed his satisfaction that the local party committees attached great importance to the tool improvement movement, and gave important instructions on further strengthening the leadership of the tool improvement movement. Chairman Mao said: Party committees at all levels must ascertain the situation. How many farm tools in the entire province and region need to be improved? How many farm tools need to be fitted with ball bearings? A plan should be made, specifying which should be improved first and which later, and when it should be completed, all should have a specific arrangement. In this way, the leadership will be concrete and strengthened, and the tool improvement movement will be better carried out.
　　According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Central Secretariat separately convened telephone conferences for provincial party secretaries in the northern and southern provinces. Comrade Tan Zhenlin first conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions at the meeting. Then, each province reported on the progress and problems of the movement, and also reported on the overall plan for tool reform in their province.
　　The reports from the provinces showed that after receiving the joint instructions from the Central Committee and the State Council and holding the previous telephone conference, the cadres felt that the direction was clear and the requirements were specific, so their confidence was high and their enthusiasm was great. A tool improvement movement centered on the installation of ball bearings has been enthusiastically launched in various places. This movement clearly shows the following characteristics that are different from the past: First, the party committee attaches importance to it, and the secretaries take the lead. Specialized organizations for leading the tool improvement movement have been established at all levels from the province to the county to the township. Second, the cadres and the masses are very enthusiastic, and the movement is progressing quickly and well. All provinces in the country have successfully manufactured various ball bearings of different specifications and models. Except for a few provinces, the vast majority of provinces have seen many townships, villages, and counties that have converted to ball bearings, and more townships and counties that have improved their tools and motorized their transportation. The third characteristic is that many regions have overcome the shortcomings of the past where creation and invention were divorced from popularization and use, and have firmly grasped the principle of improving and promoting simultaneously, so that improvement and popularization are combined. Fourth, all provinces have formulated specific tool improvement plans based on their local conditions and needs. These plans not only have an overall situation and overall goals, but also have specific requirements for improving various major farm tools, and the types, quantities, and completion dates of the farm tools that need to be improved are specified in great detail.
　　Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Liaoning and other provinces unanimously guaranteed in their reports that before the end of August or before the autumn harvest, all major rotating tools such as transportation vehicles, water lifting tools, threshing and agricultural product processing tools would be installed with ball bearings; and all major autumn harvest, autumn plowing and autumn planting tools would be improved. By the end of this year, all provinces can achieve ball bearing conversion of agricultural production rotating tools and improved agricultural production and basic construction tools.
　　While reporting on the situation, the provinces pointed out that at present, among some leading cadres and many grassroots workers, there are still erroneous ideas such as "waiting for mechanization," "perfectionism," and "mysterious" views about the tool improvement movement. All provinces have decided to strengthen political and ideological work, and quickly correct and overcome these erroneous ideas to ensure that the tool improvement movement is carried out faster and better.

　　要具体领导工具改革
    毛主席要各地摸清情况订出规划
    中共中央书记处召开电话会议进行推动和检查
    本报讯  中共中央书记处两次召开全国省委书记电话会议，布置和检查农村工具改良运动。毛主席对工具改良运动的领导问题作了重要指示。
    7月13日中共中央和国务院联合发出关于迅速在农村展开农具改良运动的指示以后，全国各地的工具改良运动更加热烈地开展起来了。为了进一步推动这个运动的发展和检查运动中的问题，最近，中央书记处曾两次召开省委书记电话会议。两次会议分别由中央书记处书记彭真同志和谭震林同志主持。
    在第一次会议上，除继续贯彻中央和国务院联合指示的精神外，并进一步指出工具改良运动是我国当前农业生产中的中心问题，要求各地党委要特别加强对于这一运动的领导。谭震林同志在会上指出：运转工具滚珠轴承化是当前工具改良运动中的主要环节，它是我国农业生产走上半机械化的根本标志。各地领导同志应该抓住这一主要环节，发动广大群众，开展一个以滚珠轴承化为中心的、创造发明和推广使用相结合的工具改良运动。
    毛主席对工具改良运动非常关怀，电话会议以后，特向谭震林同志详细了解了运动进展的情况。毛主席对各地党委都十分重视工具改良运动，表示满意，并对进一步加强工具改良运动的领导问题，作了重要的指示。毛主席说：各级党委要摸清情况，全省全区有多少农具需要改良，多少农具需要装上滚珠轴承？订个规划，哪种先改、哪种后改，什么时候完成，都要有个具体安排。这样，领导就具体了，加强了，工具改良运动就会更好地开展起来了。
    根据毛主席的指示，中央书记处又分别召开了北方各省和南方各省的省委书记电话会议。谭震林同志在会议上首先传达了毛主席的指示。接着各省汇报了运动进展的情况和问题，也汇报了本省工具改革的全面规划。
    各省汇报的情况表明：接到中央和国务院的联合指示和开过上次电话会议后，干部们都感到方针明确，要求具体，因此信心很高，劲头很大，一个以安装滚珠轴承为中心的工具改良运动，已经在各地热烈地展开。这一运动明显地表现出来与过去不同的如下特点：第一，党委重视，书记挂帅，从省到县到乡都已层层建立起领导工具改良运动的专门机构。第二，干部群众劲头都很大，运动进展又快、又好。全国各省都已制造成功了规格型号不同的各种滚珠轴承，除个别省份外，绝大多数的省都已出现了不少滚珠轴承化的社、乡、县，出现了更多的工具改良化、运输车子化的乡、县。第三个特点是很多地区克服了过去创造发明和推广使用脱节的缺点，紧紧掌握了边改良边推广的原则，作到了改良与推广相结合。第四是各省都根据本地情况和需要，拟定了具体的工具改良规划。这些规划不仅有总的情况总的目标，而且还有对各种主要农具进行改良的具体要求，对需要改良的农具种类、数量以及完成改良的日期时间，都规定得十分具体。
    河北、山东、安徽、河南、江苏、山西、辽宁等省在汇报情况中一致保证，在8月底或秋收以前，把一切主要的运转工具如运输车辆、提水工具、脱粒和农产品加工工具等都安装上滚珠轴承；把一切主要的秋收秋耕秋种工具都改良化。到今年年底各省都可达到农业生产运转工具滚珠轴承化，一切农业生产和基本建设工具改良化。
    各省在汇报情况的同时指出，目前在部分的领导干部和不少的基层工作人员中，对工具改良运动仍存在着“等待机械化”思想、“十全十美”思想以及“神秘”观点等错误思想。各省决定加强政治思想工作，迅速纠正和克服这些错误思想，以保证工具改良运动更快更好地开展起来。
