Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 15th: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has achieved a bumper harvest of early rice, the best in its history. The region's more than 12 million mu of early rice have been basically harvested. Preliminary statistics show that the total output reached more than 5.64 billion jin, an increase of 91.2% over last year, with an average yield of 461 jin per mu.

The fundamental reason for Guangxi's bumper early rice harvest is the political leadership of Party committees at all levels and the soaring spirit of the people of all ethnic groups, who overcame severe drought and various conservative ideas to seize large amounts of grain from nature.

In the first half of this year, the total rainfall in various parts of the autonomous region decreased by a quarter to a third compared with the same period last year. Most areas had not had soaking rain from last winter to June this year. However, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, an anti-drought army of more than three million people worked tirelessly day and night, staying on the front line for three months and overcoming the drought.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th: Hunan Province has achieved a large-scale, balanced increase in early rice production. Among the province's 95 counties and cities, 16 counties and cities have been found to have an average yield of 800 to more than 1,000 jin per mu. These 16 counties and cities have a total of more than 5.3 million mu of early rice, with an actual harvest of more than 4.857 billion jin of dry grain, an increase of 2.2 times over the total early rice production of more than 1.5 billion jin last year. Among them, the counties and cities with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu are Liling County, Yiyang County, and Yiyang City; the counties with a yield of 900 to 1,000 jin per mu are Xiangxiang County and Liuyang County; the counties with a yield of 800 to 900 jin per mu are Xupu, Pingjiang, Yueyang, Changde, Ningxiang, Chenxi, Leiyang, Huitong, Yuanling, Qianyang, and Huaihua.

From the perspective of distribution, the increase in early rice production this year is astonishing, regardless of whether it is in plains, mountainous areas, high-yield areas, or low-yield areas. From both sides of the Xiang River to the mountainous areas of western Hunan, from the shores of Dongting Lake to the Wuling Mountains in the south, red flags of high yield have been planted everywhere.

Large-scale bumper harvests were not obtained in favorable weather conditions. This year, these counties and cities have suffered from varying degrees of waterlogging, drought, and insect pests. However, the vast number of farmers and cadres who have been ideologically liberated through the rectification movement, under the leadership of the Party and under the glorious light of the General Line, have continuously overcome various natural disasters with the spirit of continuous revolution, shattered the repeated attacks of the "wait-and-see faction," and implemented various yield-increasing measures centered on close planting, thus winning this great harvest.

Xinhua News Agency: The more than 1,038,000 mu of early rice in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, achieved an average yield of 975 jin per mu, an increase of 128% over last year. This is the prefecture with the highest unit area yield of early rice in the entire province of Sichuan.

Most of Wenjiang Prefecture belongs to the Dujiangyan irrigation area in the western Sichuan Plain. The natural conditions here are superior, but the increase in rice production has not been significant in recent years. Last year, the average yield of rice per mu in the whole region was only more than 500 jin. This year, in the upsurge of the great leap forward in agricultural production, farmers in various places have exerted their energy and reformed various farming techniques, so the early rice yield in the entire region has doubled compared with last year.

### 广西早稻增产近倍　湖南十六县市增产二点二倍　四川温江专区亩产九百多斤

　　广西早稻增产近倍
　　湖南十六县市增产二点二倍
　　四川温江专区亩产九百多斤
    据新华社南宁15日电　广西僮族自治区今年早稻获得了有史以来的大丰收。全区一千二百多万亩早稻，已基本收割完毕，据初步统计总产量达五十六亿四千多万斤，比去年增加91.2％，平均单位面积产四百六十一斤。
    广西早稻大丰收的根本原因是各级党委政治挂帅，各族人民发扬冲天干劲，战胜严重干旱，克服了各种保守思想，才向自然界夺取到大量粮食。
    今年上半年自治区各地总降雨量，比去年同期减少四分之一到三分之一。大部地区从去年冬季到今年6月，一直没有下过透雨。但在各级党委领导下，三百多万人的抗旱大军，披星戴月，日夜苦战，三个月不下火线，战胜了干旱。
    据新华社长沙15日电　湖南省早稻大面积平衡增产。全省九十五个县、市中，发现有十六个县市平均亩产八百至一千多斤。这十六个县市共有五百三十多万亩早稻，实收干谷四十八亿五千七百一十一万多斤，较去年早稻总产量十五亿多斤，增产二点二倍。其中亩产一千斤以上的，有醴陵县、益阳县和益阳市；亩产九百斤至一千斤的，有湘乡县和浏阳县；亩产八百斤至九百斤的，有溆浦、平江、岳阳、常德、宁乡、辰溪、耒阳、会同、沅陵、黔阳、怀化等十一个县。
    从分布的地区来看，无论是平原、山区、高产区和低产区，今年早稻增产的幅度都是惊人的。从湘江两岸到湘西山区，从洞庭湖滨到南部的五岭山麓，到处都插起了丰产的红旗。
    大面积丰收并不是在风调雨顺中获得的。今年，这些县市都遭受不同程度的水、旱、虫灾，但是通过整风运动而获得思想解放的广大农民和干部，在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，以不断革命的精神，连续战胜了各种自然灾害，粉碎了观潮派的多次进攻，贯彻了以密植为中心的各项增产措施，才赢得这场大丰收的。
    据新华社讯　四川省温江专区的一百零三万八千多亩早稻，平均每亩产量达到九百七十五斤，比去年增产128％。这是目前四川全省早稻单位面积产量最高的一个专区。
    温江专区大部地方是属于川西平原的都江堰灌溉区。这里自然条件优越，但几年以来水稻增产幅度不大，去年全区水稻每亩平均产量只有五百多斤。今年在农业生产大跃进的浪潮中，各地农民鼓足干劲，改革了各种耕作技术，因而全区的早稻产量就比去年翻了一番。
