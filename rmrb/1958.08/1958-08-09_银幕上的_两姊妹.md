“Two Sisters” is the first part of Alexei Tolstoy’s trilogy “The Road to Calvary.” This novel spans from the eve of World War I in 1914 to the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets in 1920, which adopted Lenin's plan for electrification. This was a significant historical period for the Russian people: World War I, the February Revolution, the October Revolution, the Civil War, and economic recovery. Tolstoy spent over two decades depicting these six or seven years of a great era.

The author primarily writes about the transformation process of Russian bourgeois intellectuals through the experiences of the two sisters, Katya and Dasha, and their husbands, Roschin and Telegin, during this great era. The ideological transformation of bourgeois intellectuals is a painful process. Tolstoy depicts these four characters undergoing arduous and complex journeys, finally understanding the events happening around them and embarking on a new path of serving their country and people.

It is fitting that Tolstoy wrote about the transformation of intellectuals because he himself underwent ideological transformation, changing from a "Count" to a Soviet writer. This is why "The Road to Calvary" achieved such great success.

The film "Two Sisters" is also a successful work.

“Two Sisters” is one part of the trilogy (the other two parts are “1918” and “Bleak Morning”), and should be viewed in the context of the entire trilogy, not in isolation. Because "Two Sisters" depicts events before the October Revolution, it portrays the turbulent lives of the two intellectual women, Katya and Dasha, and their lovers—two young intellectuals. These individuals were kind and upright people in the old society. Although they were not infected and corrupted by the decadent, desperate, and shameless lives of the pre-war and pre-revolutionary bourgeoisie, and did not perish with the bourgeoisie, they were not directly connected to the revolutionary struggles of the time. They pursued personal happiness and experienced the joys and sorrows of love. The film's success lies in its constant depiction of the era's background, writing about the events happening around them without exaggeration, thus creating a clear contrast: in the great events of a great era, the thoughts and feelings of these characters were completely confined to the narrow circle of personal joys and sorrows.

If we consider the entire trilogy, if we know that Telegin, Roschin, and their wives will gradually awaken from the world outside the struggle and enter the struggle, the more we see their hesitation in "Two Sisters," the more we will understand why they had to endure such painful trials in "1918," and the clearer we will understand the joy with which they embarked on a new path in "Bleak Morning."

The most successful scenes in the film are several crowd scenes: demonstrations, soldiers in the trenches, struggles in prisoner-of-war camps, angry masses of soldiers killing bourgeois political commissars, etc. Here we see the excellent traditions of Soviet film art.

Every frame of the film is beautiful, and we can see the director and cinematographer's painstaking arrangements everywhere, using many new techniques (such as using shadows and cutaways to enhance the atmosphere). These are cleverly drawn paintings through the backdrop of bloody struggles. The Marseillaise outside the window, sailors of the Baltic Fleet marching on the street, and workers' teams parading with banners all illustrate that the great October Revolution is about to arrive. When Dasha reveals to her lover Telegin that she is pregnant, a gust of wind blows open their window, and the wind of the outside world breaks through the peaceful life in their room, symbolizing that they must throw themselves into the struggle to be tempered—the film thus comes to a temporary end.

    银幕上的“两姊妹”
    林陵
    “两姊妹”是阿·托尔斯泰长篇小说“苦难的历程”三部曲里的第一部。这部小说从1914年第一次世界大战前夕，写到1920年全俄第三次苏维埃代表大会通过列宁提出的电气化计划。这是俄罗斯人民的重大历史时期：世界大战、二月革命、十月革命、内战、恢复经济。这六七年的伟大时代的描绘，阿·托尔斯泰花了二十多年的时间。这三部曲被称为苏维埃时代巨大的作品之一。
    作者主要是通过卡嘉、达莎两姊妹和她们的丈夫罗申、杰列金在这大时代的经历，写出俄罗斯资产阶级知识分子的改造过程。资产阶级知识分子思想的改造，是一个苦难的过程。阿·托尔斯泰写这四个人物，经历了艰苦的复杂的道路，终于了解他们周围所发生的事变，走向为祖国为人民服务的新生之路。
    由阿·托尔斯泰来写知识分子的改造是很适当的，因为他本人就是经过思想意识的改造才从“伯爵”转变成为苏维埃作家的。“苦难的历程”所以得到如此巨大的成功，原因就在于此。
    电影“两姊妹”同样也是成功的作品。
    “两姊妹”是三部曲之一（其余两部是“1918年”和“阴暗的早晨”），应该从整个三部曲来看它，不能孤立地看。因为“两姊妹”是写十月革命以前的事情，写卡嘉和达莎这两位知识妇女以及她们的爱人——两个知识青年的动荡的生活。这几个人在旧社会里是善良正直的人，他们虽然没有被战前和革命前资产阶级颓废绝望、荒淫无耻的生活感染得堕落下去，随着资产阶级的毁灭而毁灭，但是他们和当时的革命斗争并没有直接联系，他们所追求的是个人幸福，他们经历着爱情的悲欢离合。影片处理得成功的地方，就在于处处绘画出时代的背景，毫不渲染地写出他们身边所发生的事情，因而也作出鲜明的对照：在大时代的大事变中，这几个人物的思想感情竟完全局限在个人悲欢的狭小圈子里。
    如果我们从整个三部曲来看，如果我们知道杰列金、罗申和他们的妻子，都将从斗争之外的世界里渐渐地觉醒起来而走进斗争里，我们愈是看到他们在“两姊妹”里的彷徨，就会愈加懂得为什么他们在“1918年”里要受到那样痛苦的考验，愈加明白他们在“阴暗的早晨”里走上新生之路的欢快。
    片中处理得最成功的还是几个群众场面：游行示威，战壕里的兵士，俘虏营里的搏斗，愤怒的士兵群众击毙资产阶级的政治委员等等。在这里我们看到了苏联电影艺术的优良传统。
    影片的每幅画面都是美丽的，处处看到导演和摄影师煞费苦心的安排，并且采用了好多新的手法（如用影子、切脱等方法来加强气氛）。这是巧妙地透过血的斗争的背影来描出的画幅，窗户外面的马赛曲，大街上走过的波罗的海舰队的水手，拿着标语旗游行的工人队伍，处处说明伟大的十月革命就要来到了。达莎在向自己的爱人杰列金透露她已怀孕的时候，一阵大风吹开了他们的窗子，外面世界的风冲破了他们室内平静的生活，象征他们必须投进斗争里去锻炼，——影片就这样暂时告了一个段落。
