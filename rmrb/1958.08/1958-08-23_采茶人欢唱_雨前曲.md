　　Tea Pickers Cheerfully Sing the "Pre-Rain Melody"
　　Lǐ Gāng
　　The "Pre-Rain Melody," recently performed in the capital by the Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe No. 2, is a play reflecting the technical revolution carried out by Zhejiang farmers during the Great Leap Forward. It depicts the revolutionary zeal and creativity of the rural girls in Zhejiang in tea-picking production. Their active labor forces the accounting staff responsible for registration and acceptance to rush around in a flurry, and even forces Uncle Cai and others in the tea-frying room to be unable to finish frying the tea on time, even complaining that the girls are picking too much. Under these circumstances, the tea-frying room has no choice but to also leap forward and engage in technical revolution. Uncle Cai is an experienced master of tea-frying and is enthusiastic about his work, but he does not believe in the zeal and creativity of the masses. When the Party Branch Secretary mobilizes women to participate in the tea-frying work, he opposes it because he believes they cannot learn it in a short period of time. When Cai Xinhua, a Communist Youth League member in the tea-frying room, wants to engage in technical revolution and create a tea-frying machine, he also opposes it repeatedly. Only when the machine is successfully created is he educated. The mechanized production in the tea-frying room puts forward new tasks and new requirements for the tea-picking girls. Their original tea-picking methods and speed are far behind the mechanized production in the tea-frying room. But the girls actively think of ways and quickly catch up.
　　This play focuses on the struggle between Cai Xinhua, a member of the Communist Youth League, and his father, Uncle Cai. Uncle Cai is enthusiastic, responsible, but does not believe in the masses or in technical revolution. The contradiction between these two aspects arises within himself, making the character come alive. In addition, although the Party Branch Secretary and the accountant have few scenes, they also leave some impression on the audience.
　　The entire performance is permeated with a healthy and cheerful tone from beginning to end. The musical design and singing of the whole play make people feel fresh. In terms of singing, the actors boldly broke through the original singing method, making the language closer to Mandarin, so that northerners can understand most of it without looking at the subtitles.
　　Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe No. 2 is the first professional Yue Opera troupe in our country to use both male and female actors. In the past five years, in the experimental process of co-performance by men and women, they have conscientiously studied and researched, created various male vocal keys, and basically solved the problem of singing tunes for co-performance by men and women. This will be a good start for the innovation of Yue Opera art, and it is hoped that they will continue to work hard and make more achievements.

　　采茶人欢唱“雨前曲”
　　李刚
    浙江省越剧二团最近在首都演出的“雨前曲”，是一出反映浙江农民在大跃进中进行技术革命的戏。它描写了浙江农村姑娘们采茶生产的革命干劲和创造精神，由于她们的积极劳动，迫使登记验收的会计手忙脚乱，更迫使炒茶室的蔡老伯等不能按时炒完茶，甚至嫌她们采得太多了。在这种情况下，采茶室不得不跟着跃进，不得不闹技术革命。蔡老伯是一个富有炒茶经验的能手，热心工作，但是他不相信群众的干劲和创造性。党支书动员妇女参加炒茶工作，他认为短时间学不会而反对，炒茶室的共青团员蔡新华要闹技术革命，要创造炒茶的机器，他也再三的反对，结果机器创造成功了，才教育了他。炒茶室的机器生产，又给采茶姑娘们提出了新的任务、新要求，她们原来的采茶方法和速度远远跟不上炒茶室的机器生产了。但姑娘们积极想办法，很快就赶上去了。
    这个戏着重描写了青年团员蔡新华和他父亲蔡老伯的斗争，蔡老伯热心、负责，但又不相信群众，不相信技术革命，这二者之间在他自己身上产生了矛盾，因而使这个人物活起来了。此外，党支部书记和会计这两个人物虽然戏不多，也给人留下了一些印象。
    整个戏的演出，自始至终贯穿着健康愉快的情调。全剧的音乐设计和歌唱使人感到清新，演员在歌唱方面，大胆地突破了原来的唱法，使语言更加接近普通话一些，北方人不看字幕，也可以听懂绝大部分。
    浙江省越剧二团是我国第一个用男女合演的专业越剧团。五年来他们在男女合演的实验过程中，认真地进行学习和研究，创造了各种男声基调，基本上解决了男女合演的唱腔曲调问题，这对于越剧艺术的革新将是一个很好的开端，希望他们继续努力，做出更多的成绩。
