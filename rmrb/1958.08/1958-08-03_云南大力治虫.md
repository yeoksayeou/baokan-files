Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Yunnan's farmers, combining weeding and topdressing, have launched a large-scale pest control campaign, having already eliminated pests on more than 900,000 mu of land.

Various localities, based on the situation that drought this year makes it easy for pests to occur, have made early deployments and preparations for pest control work. They have adopted methods such as combining manual capture with machinery and pesticides, and combining local pesticides with foreign pesticides to control pests, with great effect.
