　　Maternity and Infant Hotel
    Traveling a long distance with children is a troublesome matter. Recently, the Hebei District Welfare Company in Tianjin established a maternity and infant hotel near the East Railway Station, specializing in accommodating women and travelers with children.
    The hotel is equipped with children's beds, oilcloths for babies, and nursing bottles. There is also a children's playground in the courtyard, with many children's toys, picture books, toy cars, and rattles prepared. The hotel's manager, accountant, and service staff are all women. They also sell cosmetics and other women's products on behalf of others. The hotel also has a small shop selling biscuits, milk powder, and other food for children. In a few days, a baby barbershop will be added so that children staying at the hotel can get their hair cut without going out.
    This maternity and infant hotel has been fully booked every day since its establishment on the 3rd of this month. The children's mothers like this hotel very much, believing that staying here is more convenient in every way than staying in ordinary hotels, and more than forty people have already expressed their praise and approval.

　　妇婴旅馆
    带着小孩出远门是件麻烦的事情。最近，天津市河北区福利公司在东车站附近设立了一家妇婴旅馆，专门招待妇女和带小孩的旅客。
    这个旅馆里备有小孩床、小孩油布和奶瓶，院内还设有一个儿童乐园，预备了许多小孩玩具、小人书、小汽车和花铃等。旅馆的经理、会计、服务员全都是妇女。她们还代卖化妆品和其他妇女用品。旅馆里还有一个小卖部，专卖小孩吃的饼干、奶粉等。过几天，还要增设一个婴儿理发室，使住旅馆的小孩不出门就可以理发。
    这个妇婴旅馆，从本月3日成立以来，天天客满。孩子母亲们非常喜欢这个旅馆，认为住在这里比起普通旅馆来是处处方便，已经有四十多人提出了表扬和赞许的意见。（附图片）
