　　Logistics for the Steel Army
    Recently, various regions have been vigorously pursuing steel production. From Party committee secretaries to steel warriors, everyone is brimming with energy and high morale. These news items are truly encouraging to read. Today, new good news has arrived: many cities are building smelting equipment to support the steel "marshals" setting up camp in various places. This is an indispensable logistics support on the steel front.

    It's like fighting a war; no matter how high the morale, you can't fight bare-chested. The steel front is the same way. Without iron and steelmaking equipment, you can't get large quantities of steel. The machinery industry has the responsibility to supply smelting equipment that is plentiful, fast, and of good quality. This is a major political task. As can be seen from today's news, the workers in the machinery industry are treating their tasks in this way. The workers in Shenyang City have proposed thousands of measures, and many machinery factories in Tianjin City have even "stopped production to make way," temporarily putting aside products that are not urgently needed and giving priority to the production of smelting equipment, treating the steel production tasks of various places as their own production tasks, fully demonstrating the noble communist spirit of China's working class.

    On the merit book of the steel front, the contributions of the workers in the machinery industry should naturally be recorded.

### 钢铁大军的后勤

　　钢铁大军的后勤
    最近各地大抓钢铁，从党委书记到钢铁战士，个个鼓足干劲，斗志旺盛。这些消息真是读来令人鼓舞。今天又传来新的喜讯，许多城市为了支援各地钢铁“元帅”升帐，大造冶炼设备。这是目前钢铁战线上必不可少的后勤支援。
    好比打仗，无论士气如何旺盛，但总不能赤膊上阵。钢铁战线也是这样，缺乏炼铁炼钢设备就拿不到大量钢铁。机械工业有责任供应又多又快又好的冶炼设备，这是一项重大的政治任务。从今天的新闻里可以看出，机械工业的职工们正是这样对待自己的任务的。沈阳市职工提出了千百条措施，天津市的许多机械厂甚至“停车让路”暂时放下不是急需的产品，优先赶制冶炼设备，把各地钢铁生产任务当作自己的生产任务，充分表现了我国工人阶级的高贵的共产主义风格。
    在钢铁战线的记功簿上，自然应当记下机械工业职工的一份功劳。
