Suqian County Completes Renovation of Transportation and Irrigation Tools in Eight Days; Anlu County Transforms Old-fashioned Waterwheels in Seven Days

    (Our report) Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized the masses and relied on local experts to vigorously establish ball bearing factories. Twenty-three ball bearing factories were set up in the county's twenty-five townships, producing more than 30,000 ball bearings daily. Factories and agricultural cooperatives worked together, and in eight days, they equipped the county's small carts, ox carts, and waterwheels with more than 60,000 sets of self-made ball bearings. The transportation and irrigation tools were basically equipped with ball bearings, and the transportation efficiency generally increased by two to three times. Agricultural, threshing, and processing tools that can be fitted with ball bearings will soon be fully equipped with ball bearings.

    After the busy summer harvest, the great leap forward in agricultural production in the county surged even higher. Targets and measures were repeatedly increased, and labor appeared even more strained. The Suqian County Party Committee proposed "Relying on the masses to work hard for ten days to achieve bearingization of all vehicles in the county." Then, it concentrated twenty-six township-run farm implement factories to hold an on-site meeting in Sucheng on the local method of manufacturing ball bearings, conveying the technical experience of hardware repair shops in manufacturing ball bearings. Workers from various townships learned the manufacturing technology and immediately started working hard upon returning. Workers in factories in various townships made do with whatever was available, relied on their own efforts, and overcame various difficulties. They manufactured their own homemade lathes and stamping machines when they lacked tools. The county manufactured and renovated a total of twenty-three homemade lathes, thirteen presses, stamping machines, steel mills, and more than 300 sets of various homemade molds specifically for the production of ball bearings. Ball bearing factories quickly blossomed throughout the county.

    In the process of mass producing ball bearings, the whole people cooperated to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Farmers throughout the county collected scrap iron and old steel, and supply and marketing departments tried every means to purchase steel. Factories also fully demonstrated the spirit of cooperation and made adjustments with each other. Thanks to the cooperation and support from all parties, the daily output of ball bearings increased from 8,000 and 10,000 to more than 30,000, and the output of bearings closely followed.

    In order to quickly apply the produced ball bearings to production, more than 1,500 iron and wood workers in the county were divided into districts and contracted to go to agricultural cooperatives and water conservancy construction sites to provide technical guidance on the installation of ball bearings. From June 27 to July 3, a total of more than 33,000 small carts, ox carts, waterwheels, etc., were fitted with ball bearings in eight days. After these vehicles were fitted with bearings, their efficiency increased significantly. Small carts could originally only carry about 200 jin per trip, but now they can carry 600 jin, and it is easier and more labor-saving to push them. An ox cart originally required four oxen to pull 2,000 jin, but now three oxen can pull 3,000 jin.

    (Our report) Anlu County, Hubei Province, achieved waterwheel improvement in seven days, creating and imitating 32 types of waterwheels. More than 14,000 of the county's original 16,000 old-fashioned waterwheels have been renovated.

    From the perspective of the types of improved waterwheels, there are foot-operated flywheel waterwheels suitable for plains areas; there are double-person foot-operated flywheel waterwheels suitable for hilly areas; there are hand-cranked and foot-operated suction cylinder waterwheels for drawing well water, spring water, and deep water, which the masses call "homemade pumps"; there are waterwheels made by the masses using various old materials, such as wooden flywheels, stone flywheels, iron hammer flywheels, and old stone mill flywheels, which the masses call "Zhuge waterwheels"; there are turning bucket waterwheels imitated by Fushui Township, one of which can抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵抵を 41661677203229640000000000000001.5555424e+45

    宿迁县八天改完运输排灌工具  安陆县七天使旧式水车大变样
    本报讯　江苏省宿迁县发动群众，依靠土专家，大办滚珠轴承厂。全县二十五个乡镇办起二十三个滚珠轴承厂，日产滚珠三万粒以上。工厂和农业社通力合作，奋战八天，已用自己制造的六万多套滚珠轴承装备了全县小土车、牛车、水车，运输和排灌工具基本实现滚珠轴承化，运输效率普遍提高二倍到三倍。可以安装滚珠轴承的耕作、脱粒和加工等工具最近将全部实现滚珠轴承化。
    夏收大忙后，全县农业生产大跃进浪潮更加高涨，指标、措施一再加码，劳动力显得更为紧张。中共宿迁县委提出“依靠群众苦干十天，全县车辆实现轴承化”。接着集中了二十六个乡办农具厂在宿城召开土法造滚珠轴承的现场会议，传授五金修配厂制造滚珠轴承的技术经验。来自各乡的工人学会了制造技术，回去立即大干起来。各乡工厂的工人因陋就简，自力更生，克服了各种困难。没有工具他们自己动手制造土车床、土冲床。全县共制造和改制了专门生产滚珠轴承的土车床二十三部，压床、冲床、钢磨等十三部，各种土模子三百多套。滚珠轴承厂迅速在全县开花。
    大量生产滚珠轴承过程中，全民通力合作，解决原材料不足的困难。全县农民搜集废铁旧钢，供销部门千方百计地购买钢材。各工厂也充分发挥了协作精神，互相进行调剂。由于各方面的协作支援，滚珠轴承的日产量由八千、一万增加到三万粒以上，轴承的产量也紧紧跟上。
    为了迅速将生产的滚珠轴承运用到生产中去，全县一千五百多铁木工人划片包干，深入到农业社、水利工地进行滚珠轴承的安装技术指导。全县从6月27日到7月3日的八天中共有三万三千多辆小土车、牛车、水车等安装了滚珠轴承。这些车辆安装轴承后，效率显著提高。小土车原来一趟只能推两百斤左右，现在装六百斤，推起来反而轻便省力。一部牛车四头牛拉两千斤，现在三头牛可以拉三千斤。

    本报讯　湖北省安陆县在七天中实现了水车改良化，创造和仿制各式水车三十二种，全县原有的一万六千余部旧式水车已改了一万四千余部。
    从改良水车的类型来看，有适合平原地区用的脚踩飞轮水车；有适合丘陵地区用的双人脚踩飞轮水车；有车井水、泉水、深水用的手摇和脚踩吸筒水车，群众称之为“土抽水机”；有群众利用各种旧料制成的木头飞轮、石头飞轮、铁锤飞轮、旧石磨飞轮等水车，群众把这种水车叫做“诸葛水车”；有洑水乡仿制的翻戽水车，一部能抵旧水车六部，能节省二十四个劳力，群众叫这种水车为“龙王牌”水车；此外，还有全县比较普遍的脚踏车式水车，也有不用人力的畜力和风力水车等。这些水车一般都能节省三至四个劳力，提高工效二至三倍。
    开始改良水车时，干部和群众都认为，改水车如果没有一定的手艺就莫想动手。因此改良水车工作一直由农具厂承担。六合乡农具厂只有木工三十四人，却承订了三百多部改良水车的任务，农业社急需要用，催得火急，而工人却反映：“靠我们这几个人，就是日夜不睡，也得一个多月才能改好。”洑水乡三八社，单纯依靠社的农具厂改制水车，十几天只改制了十部。群众等火了，给农具厂送了一张大字报：“木工厂，技术强，天天都在讲改良，眼看抗旱这紧张，水车还是老模样。”
    显然，这种单纯依靠农具厂的办法是不能满足抗旱形势的需要的。这时，县委抓住了破除迷信，依靠群众这条纲，把运动迅速由工厂搬到群众中去。首先县委把城北乡作为一个重点。这个乡的党总支书记根据县委的指示，在光明一社和社员盛宽刚研究亲自制成了一部木十字架飞轮水车。当晚，这个社的八部水车就全部安了飞轮。第二天经过召开现场会议以后，全乡一天一夜就改了三百九十六部，实现了水车改良化。城北乡的这面依靠群众改良水车的红旗为全县的改良水车运动开辟了道路。区、乡、社干部亲自动手带头改良水车迅速形成风气。
    实现改良水车以后，大大地推动了全县的抗旱运动，一万四千多部改良水车为全县节省了四万二千多个劳力。　（王汉明）
