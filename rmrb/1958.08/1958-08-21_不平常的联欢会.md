　　Unusual Get-Together

　　Old workers from the Tianjin Musical Instrument Factory came to the small auditorium of the Music Academy in groups of three and five. The get-together began. A tall young man strode confidently to the piano and beautiful melodies flowed from under his nimble fingers. The young pianist, Liu Shikun, second-place winner of the Tchaikovsky International Piano and Violin Competition, played the piano pieces "The White Haired Girl" and "Tea Picking Lantern." This was followed by more than ten programs, including accordion, trumpet, and orchestral ensemble performances. Finally, the workers from the Tianjin Musical Instrument Factory also performed the Peking opera "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet."

　　In the work-study movement, the Central Conservatory of Music established a musical instrument factory, which has consistently received enthusiastic help from the old workers of the Tianjin Musical Instrument Factory. This performance was the students’ way of reporting good news to their masters. The Tianjin Musical Instrument Factory has also established an amateur music school, and they are very grateful to the teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music for giving them lessons.

　　不平常的联欢会
    天津乐器厂的老工人，三五成群地来到了音乐学院的小礼堂，联欢会开始了。一个身材高大的青年，矫健地走到钢琴架前，钢琴在他灵巧的手指下发出优美的旋律。青年钢琴家、柴可夫斯基钢琴和小提琴国际比赛第二名获得者刘诗昆演奏了“白毛女”和“采茶灯”钢琴曲。接着还演奏了手风琴小号和管弦乐合奏等十多个节目。最后，天津乐器厂的工人们也演出了京剧“拾玉镯”。
    中央音乐学院在勤工俭学运动中，建立了乐器厂，一直得到天津乐器厂老工人们的热情帮助。这次演出，算是学生们向师傅们报喜。天津乐器厂也成立了业余音乐学校，他们非常感谢中央音乐学院的师生们给他们上课。（附图片）
