　　Murphy's "Support"
　　Murphy, in a hurry, told reporters at London Airport on the 10th: "We (the U.S. government) fully sympathize with the ideals supported by him (Hussein), and we will continue to give him our closest support."

　　Does the puppet little King Hussein have any "ideals"? Yes. Let's use his own words to the West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" reporter, which is to rely on the British invading army to "regain enough strength to fight his enemies." For the sake of this "ideal" of his, a large number of "enemies" have been imprisoned and sent to newly built concentration camps. These "enemies," as reported by the "New York Times" reporter, are the people of Jordan.

　　What the United States "supports" is such a small court that betrays the country and opposes the people. Even if it is crumbling, the United States will "continue to give it the closest support."

　　Ryan, an Associated Press commentator, had already annotated the reason why Murphy "supported" Hussein. He said: "The United States has invested a lot of capital in Hussein -- about 130 million U.S. dollars." In fact, this is only one of the reasons. More importantly, it wants to strangle the national independence movement of the Arab nations in the Middle East. What the United States supports is exactly what the Arab people resolutely oppose. The United States has embarked on a path of hostility to the Arab people, which is also the reason why Murphy has to run into snags everywhere he peddles political conspiracies.

### 墨菲的“支持”

　  墨菲的“支持”
    行色匆匆的墨菲，10日在伦敦飞机场上对记者说：“我们
  （美国政府）完全同情他（侯赛因）所支持的理想，我们要继续给予他最密切的支持”。
    傀儡小国王侯赛因还有什么“理想”么？有的。用他自己对西德“法兰克福汇报”记者所说的话来说吧，就是依靠英国侵略军队来“重新取得足够的力量来对他的敌人进行战斗”。为了他的这个“理想”，已经把大批的“敌人”关到监狱里和新建的集中营里。这些“敌人”，正如“纽约时报”记者所报道的，就是约旦的人民。
    美国“支持”的就是这样一个出卖国家并且同人民作对的小朝廷，即使他已摇摇欲坠，美国也要“继续给予他最密切的支持”。
    墨菲“支持”侯赛因的原因，美联社评论员瑞安早就作了注解。他说：“美国在侯赛因身上投下了大笔资本——大约一亿三千万美元”。其实，这只是原因之一，更重要的是想扼杀中东阿拉伯民族独立运动。美国支持的，正是阿拉伯人民坚决反对的。美国走上了同阿拉伯人民为敌的道路，也正是墨菲到处兜售政治阴谋而不能不碰壁的原因。
