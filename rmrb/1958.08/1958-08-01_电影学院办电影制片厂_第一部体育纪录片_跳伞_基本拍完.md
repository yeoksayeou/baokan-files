    First Sports Documentary "Parachuting" Basically Completed
    (Our report) Beijing Film Academy is preparing to build an "Experimental Film Studio." Currently, two sound stages have been basically completed, and the third sound stage is under construction.

Teachers Wang Liu and Shi Kuan served as narrators for the film.
    The film "Parachuting" shows new content in the history of aviation in our country. From the film, the audience can see the popularization of parachuting as a national defense sports activity; the athletes are all workers and farmers, as well as children; one can see the parachuting tower erected on the ground and the parachuting athletes, covered with what looks like white clouds, flying in the blue sky; one can also see the athletes' diligent study and hard practice, high degree of organization and discipline, and agile movements.
    The filming of this film made full use of the academy's existing resources and was very economical. On the basis of combining education with labor, this academy will train more and better cadres, and send a large number of forces to make the film industry blossom everywhere. (Wang Heqiao)

    电影学院办电影制片厂
    第一部体育纪录片“跳伞”基本拍完
    本报讯　北京电影学院正在筹建“实验电影制片厂”，目前已基本竣工的有二个摄影棚，第三个摄影棚正在兴建。在制片厂筹备阶段，摄影系青年教师韩健文鼓足干劲，于6月底基本拍摄完毕一部短纪录片“跳伞”，这部短片分别由教师汪流、史宽担任解说员。
    影片“跳伞”的是我国航空史上新的内容。从影片中，观众们可以看到跳伞这项国防体育运动的普及；运动员都是工人和农民，还有少年儿童，可以看到平地上竖立的跳伞塔和布满了好似朵朵白云的跳伞运动员，在蔚蓝的天空飞翔，还可以看到运动员们的勤学苦练、高度组织纪律性和敏捷的动作。
    拍摄这部影片时充分利用学院现有力量，非常节约。在教育结合劳动的基础上，这个学院将锻炼出更多更好的干部，为电影事业遍地开花输送大批力量。　（王禾乔）
