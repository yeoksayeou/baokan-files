Anhui Develops Large-Scale Purchases and Sales to Meet Market Needs, Adopts Various Measures to Purchase Large Quantities of Live Pigs and Eggs
Hunan Conducts Timely Surveys of Rural Market Characteristics After the Autumn Harvest

　　This newspaper's Hefei dispatch of the 18th: Anhui's commercial departments conscientiously implement the mass line, extensively organize social forces, and the purchase of live pigs and eggs is progressing very well.

　　Anhui's production of live pigs and eggs has seen significant development this year. The number of live pigs raised in the first half of the year (including those remaining from the end of last year) increased by more than 80% compared to the same period last year. However, after the great leap forward in agricultural production, farmers did not have time to sell live pigs and eggs. Before May, the purchasing methods of commercial departments in many regions could not adapt to the needs of this new situation, so the progress of purchasing live pigs and eggs was not fast, and the purchase volume of eggs even decreased compared to the same period last year. Based on this situation, Anhui's commercial departments convened a work conference on the purchase of live pigs and eggs. Subsequently, the province adopted many effective measures to strengthen purchases, and the purchase volume in June and July rapidly increased, completing the allocation tasks ahead of schedule.

　　The first measure they took was to extensively organize social forces to assist in the purchase. In addition to commercial departments establishing more purchasing points, they also entrusted cooperative stores, the People's Bank, grain and oil management stations, and agricultural cooperative supply and marketing departments to set up purchasing points as agents.

　　Second, attention was paid to adopting a variety of methods to facilitate farmers. These methods mainly included: (1) collecting pigs and eggs while delivering goods to the countryside; (2) helping farmers with production during the day, making appointments in the fields, and collecting at the door at night; (3) grasping everything at once and then dividing the work upon return. This overcame the past single-minded purchasing method of only buying pigs or only buying eggs. The effect of adopting these methods was very good.

　　Third, a large number of pork and egg freezing plants were established, breaking the old conventions of reducing prices and suspending purchases of eggs in the summer, boldly releasing purchases, which played a significant role in ensuring large-scale purchases. (Wang Weimin)

　　This newspaper's Changsha dispatch of the 18th: What new situations are emerging in the rural market after this year's autumn harvest? The Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce, after investigation, believes that the characteristics of this year's post-autumn market are: large commodity volumes of major agricultural and sideline products, concentrated sales times, a very active market, and a prominent increase in the demand for means of production. Therefore, commercial departments must launch large-scale purchases and sales to ensure this need.

　　This investigation was conducted in three types of regions: lake areas, hilly areas, and mountainous areas. According to typical materials from seventeen agricultural cooperatives in eight counties, the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries will increase by 1.85 times compared to last year, with agriculture increasing by 1.48 times, rice by 2.74 times, and sideline industries by 2.28 times. Due to the rapid development of agricultural and sideline production, the number of commodities that farmers need to sell has greatly increased. According to a survey of typical cooperatives in seven counties, including Nanxian County, the commodity volume of rice has increased by 1.8 times compared to last year, live pigs by 3.4 times, and many agricultural and sideline products will be massively launched on the market after the autumn harvest.

　　This year, in order to ensure the development of collective enterprises, the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives will have a prominent increase, and the income that members receive from the cooperatives will also increase accordingly. According to a comprehensive survey of seventeen cooperatives in eight counties, their net cash income will increase by 89.56% compared to last year, with public accumulation increasing by 4.68 times and distribution to members increasing by 51.2%. After the change in the distribution ratio, the growth rate of rural purchasing power is greater for collective purchasing power than for individuals, and the use of means of production is more than the use of living materials. In previous years, the supply of means of production was stronger in the first half of the year than in the second half, but this historical law has been completely broken. According to the survey, the total amount of means of production purchased in rural areas in the second half of this year will increase by 6.78 times compared to the same period last year. In particular, the demand for materials such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural implements, agricultural machinery, small hardware, gas lamps, and cement will increase by nine to thirty-five times compared to last year. This year, Hunan's sweet potatoes are expected to have a bumper harvest, with an estimated total output of 30 to 40 billion jin. The machinery needed for processing this item alone will require more than 200,000 units.

　　The purchasing power of living materials will increase by about 34% compared to last year. This year, agricultural cooperatives are implementing multiple advance payments and one final settlement. It is expected that the peak season will emerge in the third quarter and gradually become stronger, continuing until the Spring Festival next year. In terms of usage: clothing will increase by more than double compared to the same period last year; usage will increase by 85.9% compared to last year; in terms of food, some staple foods no longer go through the market because agricultural cooperatives have bumper harvests, and grain and oil are distributed within the cooperatives, and pork is also self-slaughtered and self-consumed or self-slaughtered and divided. Farmers only need to purchase non-staple foods and condiments such as salt, sugar, vermicelli, as well as pastries, cigarettes, and alcohol. Therefore, only non-staple foods have increased by 41.3%. Because the problem of food has been basically solved, the increased portion of purchasing power is mainly shifted towards clothing and usage, and the quality requirements are also getting higher and higher. Wool yarn, thermos bottles, and rubber shoes have become universally and massively needed materials. After the rural labor force became tight, young and middle-aged women have participated in agricultural labor. As a result, some past household labor has become social labor, such as burning firewood being changed to burning coal, which requires commercial departments to supply it. The number of people making shoes and needlework has greatly decreased. Therefore, the demand for rubber shoes, sneakers, and various knitted products has sharply increased. At present, various localities are studying how to further develop local industries based on these new situations in order to meet the growing needs.

### 开展大购大销　适应市场需要　安徽采取多种措施大购生猪鸡蛋　湖南及时调查秋后农村市场特点

　　开展大购大销　适应市场需要
　　安徽采取多种措施大购生猪鸡蛋
　　湖南及时调查秋后农村市场特点
    本报合肥18日讯　安徽商业部门认真贯彻群众路线，广泛组织社会力量，生猪、鸡蛋的收购情况很好。
    安徽今年的生猪、鸡蛋生产有了大的发展，上半年的生猪饲养量
  （包括去年年底结存的生猪）比去年同期增加了80％以上。但是，在农业生产大跃进以后，农民没有时间出售生猪、鸡蛋。5月以前，许多地区的商业部门的收购方法不能适应这种新形势的需要，因此生猪、鸡蛋的收购进度不快，鸡蛋的收购量还比去年同期下降。安徽商业部门根据这个情况，召开了生猪、鸡蛋收购工作会议，接着全省采取许多有效措施加强收购，6、7月份的收购量便迅速上升，提前完成了调拨任务。
    他们采取的第一个措施，是广泛地组织社会力量协助收购。除了商业部门增设收购点以外，还委托合作商店、人民银行、粮油管理站、农业社供销部设立代购点。
    第二，注意采取多种多样的办法来便利农民。这些办法主要是：（一）在送货下乡的同时收猪、收蛋；（二）白天帮助农民生产，在田头进行预约，夜晚登门收购（三）下去一把抓，回来再分家，这就是克服过去收猪不收蛋，收蛋不收猪的单打一的收购方法，又收猪又收蛋。采用这些方法的效果很好。
    第三，是大量设立猪肉、鸡蛋的冷冻厂，打破了过去夏季鸡蛋必须降价和停收的陈规，大胆放手地收购，对保证大量收购起了重大作用。　（汪伟民）
    本报长沙18日电　今年秋后农村市场有些什么新的情况出现呢？湖南省商业厅经过调查认为今年秋后市场的特点是：主要农副业产品的商品量大，出售时间集中，市场非常活跃，生产资料的需要量突出增长。因此商业部门必须展开大购大销，才能保证这个需要。
    这次调查是分湖区、丘陵、山区三类地区进行的，据八个县十七个农业社的典型材料证明：今年农副业的总产值将比去年增长一点八五倍，其中农业增长一点四八倍，稻谷二点七四倍，副业二点二八倍。由于农副业生产的飞跃发展，农民需要出售的商品数量大大增加了。据南县等七个县典型社调查：稻谷商品量比去年增长一点八倍，生猪三点四倍，而且不少农副产品都将在秋后大量上市。
    今年，为了保证集体事业的发展，农业社的积累将有突出的增加，而社员从社取得的收入，也有相应的增加。据综合八县十七个社调查，他们的现金纯收入将比去年增加89.56％，其中公共积累增长四点六八倍，分给社员的增长51.2％。分配比例变化后，农村购买力增长的幅度是集体购买力大于个人，用途是生产资料多于生活资料。往年生产资料的供应是上半年比下半年旺，现在这种历史规律完全打破了。据调查，今年下半年农村购买生产资料的总额比去年同期要增加六点七八倍，特别是化肥、农具、农械、小五金、煤气灯、水泥等物资的需要量，比去年要增加九倍到三十五倍。今年湖南红薯可望丰收，估计总产量将达三百至四百亿斤，仅这一项加工用的机器就要二十多万部。
    生活资料方面的购买力将比去年约增加34％。今年农业社实行多次预支，一次决算，预料旺季将在三季度露头后即逐步转旺，一直延续到明年春节。在用途上是：穿比去年同期上升一倍多；比去年增长85.9％；吃的方面，有些主食品都不通过市场了，因为农业社丰收，粮油都由社内分配，猪肉也系自宰自食或自宰分食，农民需要购买的仅仅是食盐、糖、粉丝等副食品和调味品，以及糕点烟酒之类，因此只有副食品上升了41.3％。由于吃的问题基本解决，购买力增长部分主要转向穿和用，质量要求也越来越高，毛线、热水瓶、胶鞋等已经成为普遍大量需要的物资。农村劳力紧张后，青壮年妇女都参加了农业劳动，这样一来，过去的一些家务劳动就变成社会劳动，如烧柴改为烧煤，需要商业部门供应，做鞋和针线活的人大大减少，因此，胶鞋、球鞋和各种针织品的需要量激剧增加。目前，各地正根据这些新情况研究如何进一步发展地方工业，以满足日益增长的需要。
