Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 29th: Indian newspapers continue to publish editorials on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. Many newspapers believe that the United States should be held responsible for the developments there.

The Hindi-language "Nava Bharat Times" warned today against the military demonstrations being conducted by the United States in Taiwan, and pointed out that "the United States cannot escape the responsibility for creating a serious explosive situation in East Asia, just as it did in West Asia." This newspaper condemned the United States' interference in China's Taiwan region.

The "Hindustan Standard" today criticized the United States' policy of hostility toward the government representing China's 600 million people as being too short-sighted. This newspaper also criticized the activities of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Indian Ocean.
