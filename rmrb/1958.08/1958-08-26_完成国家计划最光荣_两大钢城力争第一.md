　　Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 25th: The hundreds of thousands of steelworkers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, with the full support of the city's people, are taking emergency measures to push production to a new peak of the Great Leap Forward with the force of a whirlwind, ensuring that they complete this year's steel production Great Leap Forward plan without failing the state in any way.

　　In the past week, this steel base has been filled with an atmosphere of intense battle. From the Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the company's manager to every worker, all regard guaranteeing the completion of this year's steel Great Leap Forward plan as an overriding political task. In the key factories of steelmaking, ironmaking, and rough rolling, which are radiating high temperatures, and on the important basic construction sites where sand and dust are flying, the municipal party secretary and company managers can often be seen studying and resolving urgent production and construction problems with the workers. Many cadres and workers have moved their bedding into the factories, staying by the furnaces and machines day and night, racing against time for steel. They are determined to complete the same amount of production in the next four months as they have completed in the past seven months.

　　Since the beginning of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production and construction have made great leaps forward. From January to July, steel production increased by 20% to 30% compared to the same period last year, and many key projects and many factories and mines have completed the Great Leap Forward plan very well. However, this leap forward is still far from the requirements, especially the production of steel and iron, which only completed about 40% of the annual Great Leap Forward plan from January to July. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently inspected the implementation of the Great Leap Forward plan by Anshan Iron and Steel Company and made emergency deployments. In addition to transferring a large number of cadres to key factories and mines to help with work and mobilizing the city's strength to support them, the municipal party secretary and company managers have reassigned themselves to key factories and mines to help solve problems.

　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company is pooling the wisdom of the masses to race against time for steel. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant fully mobilized the workers to use small cranes for maintenance instead of large cranes, and molten iron cans instead of molten steel cans. The renovation was completed in twenty hours, increasing the daily output of the No. 9 open hearth furnace by 20%. The workers of the Ironmaking Plant, whose production had not been good since July, put forward the battle slogan of "a great turnaround in August and launching satellites in September." On the 22nd, they began to reverse the situation of failing to complete production tasks, producing 343 tons more iron than the Great Leap Forward plan. The ingot casting, transportation, maintenance, and other workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant closely cooperated with the open hearth furnace workers, creating a record for the highest daily output on the 22nd.

　　In order to guarantee the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan for steel production, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently formulated measures through layer-by-layer discussions to shorten the construction period of many key projects. Factories, enterprises, people's organizations, and many government agencies in Anshan have demonstrated the spirit of communist collaboration, making support for the Great Leap Forward in steel production their primary task.

### 完成国家计划最光荣  两大钢城力争第一

　　完成国家计划最光荣
    两大钢城力争第一
    据新华社鞍山25日电　鞍山钢铁公司的十几万名钢铁大军在全市人民全力支援下，正采取紧急措施，以疾风骤雨之势，把生产推向一个新的跃进高峰，保证不亏欠国家一分任务完成今年钢铁生产跃进计划。
    近一周来，这个钢铁基地到处洋溢着紧张战斗的气氛，从中共鞍山市委书记、公司经理到每一个工人，都把保证完成今年钢铁跃进计划作为压倒一切的政治任务。在散发着高温的炼钢、炼铁、粗轧等重点工厂里，在飞扬着风沙的重要的基本建设工地上，经常可以看到市委书记和公司经理们，同工人一起研究和解决生产建设中紧急的问题。许多干部和工人，把行李卷搬进工厂，昼夜守在炉子和机器旁边，向时间争夺钢铁。他们决心要在今后四个多月里，完成同过去七个多月所完成的一样多的生产任务。
    今年以来，鞍钢的生产建设有了很大的跃进，1到7月钢铁产量比去年同期提高了20％到30％，不少重点工程、不少厂矿都很好地完成了跃进计划。但是这种跃进离要求还很远，特别是钢和铁的产量，1到7月还只完成全年跃进计划的40％左右。中共鞍山市委最近检查了鞍钢执行跃进计划的情况，作了紧急的部署。除抽调大批干部深入到重点厂矿帮助工作和动员全市的力量支援以外，市委书记和公司经理都重新分工到重点厂矿帮助解决问题。
    鞍钢正在群策群力向时间争夺钢铁。第一炼钢厂充分发动职工群众，利用检修用的小吊车代替大吊车，利用铁水罐代替钢水罐，二十小时就改装完成，使九号平炉每天增加产量百分之二十。7月份以来生产情况一直不好的炼铁厂的工人们，提出要在“8月大翻身，9月放卫星”的战斗口号，22日开始扭转了完不成生产任务的局面，比跃进计划多生产了三百四十三吨铁。第一炼钢厂的铸锭、运转、检修等工人，同平炉工人密切配合，在22日创造了日产量最高纪录。
    鞍钢的职工们为了保证实现钢铁生产跃进计划，最近经过层层讨论，订出措施，缩短了许多重点工程的工期。鞍山的工厂、企业、人民团体以及许多机关，都发挥了共产主义协作精神，把支援钢铁生产大跃进作为首要任务。（附图片）
