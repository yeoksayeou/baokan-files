　　The Old Woman and the "Water Buffalo King"

    A beautiful story is spreading in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province: Chen Fengxi, a 63-year-old woman from the Guanghui Agricultural Cooperative in Xindian Township, is raising a "Water Buffalo King." This water buffalo is a foot taller and two feet longer than ordinary water buffaloes. It is stout, strong-legged, with smooth fur, and looks like a lion. It is powerful and has a wide stride, capable of plowing 9.5 mu of paddy fields a day, twice as fast as ordinary large water buffaloes. When plowing, it takes two strong young men to hold the plow to keep up with it. The cooperative members praise it as being like a small tractor.

    Two years ago, the "Water Buffalo King" was a short, thin water buffalo that many cooperative members were unwilling to raise. At a cooperative members' meeting, Chen Fengxi volunteered to raise this water buffalo. After the old woman took the buffalo home, she cared for it meticulously for two years, treating it like her own children. In the spring, she would lead the buffalo to the grassland before dawn, and only bring it home after it had eaten its fill, then she would cook her own breakfast. When the buffalo went to plow the fields, Chen Fengxi would carry a grass basket up the mountain to cut green grass, preparing ample fine and rough fodder for the buffalo. In the summer, she would lead the buffalo up the mountain to graze before dawn, and after the sun rose, she would lead the buffalo to the shade of the trees, giving the buffalo a bath to cool off and swatting away flies. In the evening, she would also smoke out mosquitoes for the buffalo. In the cold winter, Old Woman Chen arranged the cattle pen to be clean and warm, and boiled warm water for the buffalo to drink. On snowy nights with howling north winds, she would still get up three times every night to feed the buffalo grass. Old Woman Chen often said to the cooperative members: "If people are not well-fed and warmly dressed and feel uncomfortable, they can talk; buffaloes can't talk, so we should take even better care of them." In this way, a weak water buffalo grew into the "Water Buffalo King" within two years.

　　老婆婆与“水牛王”
    江西广丰县正传颂着一件美事：新店乡光辉农业社六十三岁的老婆婆陈凤兮饲养了一条“水牛王”。这条水牛的身材比一般大水牛高一尺、长二尺，长得膘肥腿壮，四肢腾开，皮毛光滑，活像个狮子；力大步宽，一天能耕九亩五分水田，比一般的大水牛快一倍。犁田时需要两个身强力壮的青年小伙子扶犁才能跟上它，社员们夸奖它像台小拖拉机。
    两年前，“水牛王”是许多社员不愿意饲养的一条又矮又瘦的水牛。在一次社员大会上，陈凤兮自动要求把这条水牛给她饲养。老婆婆把牛牵回家后，两年如一日，像抚育自己的儿女一样细心饲养。春天里，天朦朦亮就牵牛上青草地，直到牛吃得饱饱的才牵牛回家，然后自己煮早饭吃。牛去耕田时，陈凤兮就背着草篓上山割青草，给牛准备充足的精、粗饲料。夏天里，天没亮就牵牛上山吃草，太阳露头后，把牛牵到树林下，给牛淋浴乘凉、拍苍蝇，晚上还给牛熏蚊子。到了寒冷的冬天，陈老婆婆把牛栏布置得又清洁又温暖，煮温水给牛喝。北风呼啸的雪夜里，每夜照常起床三次给牛喂草。陈老婆婆常对社员们说：“人没有吃饱穿暖，过得不舒服，会讲话；牛不会讲话，就更应该细心照顾它。”这样，一条瘦弱的水牛在两年内便长成了“水牛王”。
