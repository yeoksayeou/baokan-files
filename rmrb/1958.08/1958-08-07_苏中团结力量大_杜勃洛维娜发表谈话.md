Moscow, August 6th, this newspaper reports. After the publication of the communique on the meeting between Comrades Khrushchev and Mao Zedong in the Soviet Union, this newspaper's reporter interviewed Dubrovina, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. She told the reporter that the news of the communique of the meeting between Comrades Khrushchev and Mao Zedong quickly spread throughout the Soviet Union. It is no accident that this great meeting is being held at this time, because the aggressive actions of the American and British imperialists in the Middle East are seriously threatening world peace. Peace-loving people all over the world should unite to stop the threat of war.

The fact that the Soviet Union and China quickly reached an agreement on the current international situation and swiftly signed a communique shows that our two countries have a completely consistent view and position on the current international situation.

The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association warmly welcomes the communique of the meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong. All members of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, together with all the people of the Soviet Union, once again declare to the world that no force in the world can shake the sacred unity of the people of the Soviet Union and China. We are deeply convinced that in the struggle for peace, the forces of world peace and socialism will surely achieve final victory.

    苏中团结力量大
    杜勃洛维娜发表谈话
    本报莫斯科6日电　赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志的会谈公报在苏联发表后，本报记者访问了苏中友协副主席杜勃洛维娜。她对记者说，赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志会谈公报的消息很快地传遍了全苏联。这次伟大的会见在目前举行不是偶然的。因为美英帝国主义者在中近东的侵略行为，严重地威胁着世界和平。全世界爱好和平的人民应当团结起来制止战争威胁。
    苏中两国就目前国际局势问题很快地达成协议，并且迅速地签订了公报，这说明我们两国对目前国际局势的看法和立场是完全一致的。
    苏中友好协会热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东会谈的公报。苏中友协全体会员和全苏联人民一起再一次向世界声明：世界上没有任何一种力量能够动摇苏中两国人民的神圣团结。我们深信，在争取和平的斗争中，世界和平和社会主义力量一定取得最后胜利。
