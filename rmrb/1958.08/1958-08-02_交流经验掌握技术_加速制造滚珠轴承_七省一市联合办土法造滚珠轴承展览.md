Exchange Experiences and Master Technology to Accelerate the Manufacture of Ball Bearings
Seven Provinces and One Municipality Jointly Hold Exhibition on Homemade Ball Bearings

    (Our report) Zhengzhou, July 22nd - A ball bearing exhibition jointly organized by seven provinces (Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui) and Beijing Municipality opened in Zhengzhou on July 22nd. The purpose of this exhibition is to widely exchange experiences from various regions in relying on the masses to develop the ball bearing industry during the agricultural tool reform, so as to realize the ball bearingization of existing rural transportation tools as soon as possible.

    The exhibition has thirteen exhibition rooms. Most of the exhibits are manually made bearings of different models. If classified according to modern rolling bearings, almost all types except needle roller bearings are available. The quality of some products has reached the level of state-owned factories. Some balls have been tested to reach 3,000 revolutions per minute without heating or deforming. The exhibition also displays various tools for producing ball bearings that have been created by the masses in various regions, which are simple to make and easy to operate. This is a great creation of the people in improving the efficiency of ball bearing production after breaking through the past superstition that "ball bearing production can only rely on modern factories and there is no other way." For example, the Gucheng Iron Production Cooperative in Yuxian County, Henan Province, created a large iron mold that can hammer ten balls at once from a red-hot round iron bar, increasing the efficiency of each person in producing balls from more than 30 at the beginning to 400. Shangcai County used a Liberation-style waterwheel to transform it into a polishing machine, increasing the efficiency of ball polishing from only being able to polish more than 100 at a time to 10,000.

    At the exhibition, many charts and figures show that the industry of manufacturing ball bearings has developed quite universally in many regions to meet the needs of agricultural tool reform.

    Exhibits from relevant provinces and regions are still being transported here. The provinces and cities participating in the exhibition are now organizing relevant cadres and workers to come and visit and learn from the ball bearing production experience, further break down superstitions, master technology, and promote the development of the ball bearing industry.

    According to the planned schedule, this exhibition will be held in Zhengzhou for one month and then moved to Beijing for exhibition.

    交流经验掌握技术  加速制造滚珠轴承
    七省一市联合办土法造滚珠轴承展览
    本报讯　山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、江苏、安徽七省及北京市联合举办的滚珠轴承展览会于7月22日在郑州开幕。举办这个展览会是为广泛交流各地在农具改革中依靠群众大办滚珠轴承工业的经验，使现有农村的运转工具尽快实现滚珠轴承化。
    这个展览会共有十三个陈列室。展出的多半是手工制成的不同型号的轴承。如果按照现代化滚动轴承分类，除滚针轴承外其余几乎应有尽有。部分产品的质量达到了国营工厂的产品水平。有的滚珠经过试验，达到每分钟三千转不发热不变型。在展览会上还展出了各地群众创造的制作简单、容易操作的各种生产滚珠轴承的工具。它是人们在冲破了过去那种认为“滚珠轴承生产只能依赖现代化工厂，别无他法”的迷信以后，提高滚珠轴承生产效率的伟大创造。例如河南省禹县古城铁业生产社创造的一次能够把烧红了的圆铁棒锤成十个滚珠的大铁模，使每人每天生产滚珠的效率从开始的三十多个，提高到四百个。上蔡县用解放式水车改成的磨光机，使滚珠磨光的效率从开始的一次只能磨一百多个，提高到一万个。
    展览会上，不少图表数字表明：不少地区适应农业工具改革的需要，制造滚珠轴承的工业已经发展得相当普遍。
    有关省区的展品仍在陆续运来。参加展览的各省市，现在正分别组织各有关干部与工人等，陆续前来参观学习滚珠轴承生产经验，进一步破除迷信，掌握技术，推动滚珠轴承工业的发展。
    按照预订计划，这个展览会将在郑州展览一月，再移到北京展出。
