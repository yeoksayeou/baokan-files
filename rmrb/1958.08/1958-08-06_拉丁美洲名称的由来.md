The origin of the name Latin America
Latin America includes Central America, South America, Mexico, and the West Indies. This region is called Latin America because it was once a colony of Latin-speaking countries—mainly Spain, Portugal, and France. The colonialists brought their own languages and scripts to this region and widely spread Catholicism. Now, the people in this region, except for Brazil, which uses Portuguese, and Haiti, which uses French, all other eighteen Latin American countries use Spanish (a Romance language).

There has been debate about the name of these American countries, which were once ruled by Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonialists. Foster, in the preface to his "A Sketch of the Political History of the Americas," explained: "Writers have used various terms, such as 'Latin America,' 'Spanish America,' 'Afro-America,' 'Iberian America,' 'Indian America,' etc., and they have collected strong arguments to support the terms they use. This book uses the term 'Latin America' as a general term for these countries, not because this term is academically correct, but because there is no better term, and because this term is relatively common and has been accepted by writers and the people concerned."

Latin America has a total of twenty countries: Mexico in North America; Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama in Central America; Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in the West Indies (the British West Indies formed the West Indies Federation in March of this year); Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay in South America.

This region also has nineteen colonies. Eleven belong to Britain, such as British Guiana, British Honduras, British Virgin Islands, Falkland Islands, and South Georgia. France has three colonies under the guise of "overseas departments," such as French Guiana and Martinique. The Netherlands has two colonies disguised as "continents in opposition to the mother country," such as Dutch Guiana and Curaçao. The United States, under the lie of "associated states," occupies colonies such as Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands. These nineteen colonies are not just a few small islands, but a large area of resource-rich territory. These have become sources of huge profits for imperialism, especially American imperialism, while the local indigenous people live lives worse than animals. (Zhou)

    拉丁美洲名称的由来
    拉丁美洲包括中美洲、南美洲、墨西哥和西印度群岛。这个地区之所以称为拉丁美洲，是因为它曾经是拉丁语系国家——主要是西班牙、葡萄牙、法国——的殖民地，殖民主义者把他们自己的语言文字带到这个地区来，并且广泛传布了天主教。现在这个地区的人民除了巴西用葡萄牙语，海地用法语外，其余十八个拉丁美洲国家都使用西班牙语（拉丁语系）。
    关于这个曾经受西班牙、葡萄牙和法国殖民者统治的美洲国家的名称是有过争论的。福斯特在他写的“美洲政治史纲”的序言中曾解释说：“作家们曾使用了各种不同的名词，如‘拉丁美洲’、‘西班牙美洲’、‘阿非利加美洲’、‘伊伯利安美洲’、‘印第安美洲’等等，而他们更搜集了强有力的论据来支持自己所用的这些名词。本书用‘拉丁美洲’这个名词来作为这些国家的通称，不是因为这个名词在学术上是正确的，而是因为没有更好的名词，又因为这名词已比较通用而且作家们和有关的各族人民已经接受了它”。
    拉丁美洲共有二十个国家：在北美洲的有墨西哥；在中美洲的有危地马拉、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加、巴拿马；在西印度群岛（今年3月英属西印度群岛已成立西印度联邦）的有古巴、海地、多米尼加；在南美洲的有哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁、智利、委内瑞拉、巴西、乌拉圭、阿根廷、玻利维亚、巴拉圭。
    这个地区还有十九个殖民地。属于英国的有十一个，如英属圭亚那、英属洪都拉斯、英属维尔京群岛、福克兰群岛及南乔治亚等。法国有三块在“海外县”名称掩盖下的殖民地，如法属圭亚那、马提尼克岛等。荷兰有两块伪装成“与宗主国对立的洲”的殖民地，如荷属圭亚那、库拉萨俄岛等。美国在“联合州”的谎言下，占有了波多黎各、巴拿马运河区和维尔京群岛等殖民地。这十九块殖民地并不是几个小岛，而是一大片资源丰富的领土。这些都成了帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义攫取巨额利润的源泉，而当地土著人民却过着牛马不如的生活。（周）
