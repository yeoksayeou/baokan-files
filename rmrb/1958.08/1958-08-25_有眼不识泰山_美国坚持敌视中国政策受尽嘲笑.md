　　Blind as a Bat
    US Persistence in Hostile Policy Towards China Mocked

　　This newspaper reports that the United States' stubborn policy of hostility towards the Chinese people has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and mockery, even among Western bourgeois figures and within the United States itself. This dissatisfaction and mockery are vividly reflected in Western bourgeois newspapers and periodicals in recent times.

　　The US "United Press International" acknowledged that Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and Ceylon do not agree with the hostile attitude toward China expressed in the US State Department's recent memorandum. "These countries believe that the US policy toward China is short-sighted and that reiterating its attitude - especially at this time - is unfortunate." The British weekly "New Statesman" pointed out: "Opinion in all Asian countries believes that Dulles' China policy proves America has imperialist intentions." It also ridiculed Dulles as "blind to a surprising degree." The British "Tribune" pointed out that most independent countries in Asia have already recognized China, and now "urgently need to admit the real Chinese government into the United Nations."

　　The British conservative "Observer" in an article entitled "Allies' Frustration" on August 17, described the US State Department's memorandum as "the eccentricity of a rich and astute uncle who suddenly believes the world is flat in his old age." The article said that "America's allies" in "private comments" were that the United States' plan to help Chiang Kai-shek and other human dregs abandoned by the Chinese people to "overthrow" the Chinese government was "indirect aggression" against China; "admitting China would not weaken the United Nations," on the contrary, the absence of China "damages this world organization."

　　British Labour Party leader Aneurin Bevan criticized the United States' attempt to "isolate" China as an "absurd offense." He wrote in the "Tribune" that if the United States persists in its current policy, other countries "will unite to spurn such short-sighted, narrow-minded, self-satisfied, dangerous, and untimely leadership."

　　The Swiss "Lausanne Gazette" said that the "stubbornly negative attitude" taken by the United States towards China is "unreasonable." China's "prestige in Asia is constantly increasing," and the Chinese government "is indeed stable." Without the participation of the Chinese government, "no major international problems can be solved." The newspaper pointed out: "American policy is lagging behind the development of events." The Swiss "Tribune de Genève" pointed out that if the Eisenhower government does not change its policy toward China, it cannot but "fall into discredit."

　　Domestic US public opinion also shows increasing dissatisfaction. The "New York Post" wrote in an editorial entitled "New Documents, Old Policies": "The State Department denies that its policy is inflexible, and then presents all the old arguments." The local West Virginia newspaper "Charleston Gazette" believes that the United States "has played the ostrich trick of burying its head in the sand" in dealing with China. This makes the United States even more ridiculous in the eyes of its vassal states and neutral countries. The US Topeka's "Capital" morning paper expressed regret that the United States "clings to the dying Chiang Kai-shek regime that represents no one." The US "Christian Science Monitor" believes that the United States "finds it difficult" to convince other countries to believe that the Chinese regime "will one day disappear," pointing out that this attitude is "unrealistic" and "interferes in China's internal affairs."

　　US Senator Fulbright also criticized the policy adopted by the United States towards China as "ostrich-like." He said, "We cannot forever ignore the 600 million people on the Chinese mainland." Henry Wriston, former advisor to the US Secretary of State on foreign policy reform, criticized the US policy toward China as "completely frozen." He believes that the United States will eventually have to recognize China.

### 有眼不识泰山  美国坚持敌视中国政策受尽嘲笑

　　有眼不识泰山
    美国坚持敌视中国政策受尽嘲笑
    本报讯　美国坚持敌视中国人民的死硬政策，在西方资产阶级人士和美国国内也引起了越来越大的不满和越来越多的嘲笑。这种不满和嘲笑在最近一个时期西方资产阶级报刊上有着鲜明的反映。
    美国“合众国际社”承认：亚洲国家，如印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰等国不同意美国国务院最近在它的备忘录中所表示的对于中国的敌视态度。“这些国家认为美国对中国的政策是近视的，并且认为重申它的态度——特别在目前这个时候——是不幸的”。英国“新政治家”周刊指出：“亚洲所有国家的舆论都认为杜勒斯的对华政策证明美国有帝国主义意图”。它还讥笑杜勒斯“盲目到令人奇怪的地步”。英国“论坛”周报指出：亚洲大部分独立国家都已承认中国，现在“迫切需要接纳真正的中国政府进入联合国”。
    英国保守的“观察家报”在8月17日一篇题为“盟国的沮丧”的文章中，把美国国务院的备忘录形容为“像是一个在晚年忽然相信世界呈扁平形的有钱的和精明的大叔的怪僻”。文章说“美国的盟国”在“私下的评论”是：美国帮助蒋介石之流遭到中国人民唾弃的人类的渣滓“推翻”中国政府的计划是美国对中国的“间接侵略”；“接纳中国决不会削弱联合国”，相反，没有中国参加，却使“这个世界组织受到了损害”。
    英国工党领袖比万抨击美国企图“孤立”中国是一种“荒谬绝伦的冒犯”。他在“论坛”周报上写道：美国坚持现在的政策，其他国家“就会协同一致地来唾弃如此近视、如此狭隘自满、如此危险和如此不合乎时代迫切需要的领导”。
    瑞士“洛桑日报”说：美国对于中国所采取的“顽固的否定态度”是“不合理”的。中国“在亚洲的威望不断增加”，中国政府“确实是稳定的”，要是没有中国政府参加，“任何重大国际问题便不能解决”。这家报纸指出：“美国的政策是落后于事态发展的”。瑞士“日内瓦论坛报”指出，艾森豪威尔政府不改变它对中国的政策，不能不“落得威信扫地”。
    美国国内舆论也出现了越来越多的不满。“纽约邮报”在题为“新的文件，旧的方针”的社论里写道：“国务院否认它的政策不灵活，然后提出了全部的老论点”。美国西弗吉尼亚的地方报“卡乐斯登报”认为，美国在同中国打交道方面“玩弄了鸵鸟把头埋在沙子里的伎俩”。这使美国在它的仆从国家和中立国家的眼中变得更加可笑了。美国塔毕卡的“资本”晨报，对于美国“死抱住不代表任何人的垂死的蒋介石政权不放”表示遗憾。美国“基督教科学箴言报”认为，美国“很难”说服其他国家，使它们相信中国政权“有朝一日将会消灭”，指出这种态度是“不现实的”，而且是“干涉中国的内政”。
    美国参议员富布赖特也抨击美国对中国所采取的政策是“鸵鸟式”的。他说，“我们不能永远无视中国大陆上的六亿人民”。曾任美国国务卿外交改革问题顾问的亨利·里斯顿抨击美国的对华政策是“完全冻结了”。他认为美国将终于不得不承认中国。
