　　Combining Technical Revolution with Great Leap Forward Production Tasks
　　Xi'an Launches Industrial Great Leap Forward Movement

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, August 17th, reporter Yi Xiao reports:) Xi'an City workers are launching a large-scale industrial "bumper harvest field" movement, closely integrating the technical revolution with the completion of Great Leap Forward tasks. This movement centers on the technical revolution aimed at processing, implementing, and promoting technical innovation proposals, solving key production problems, and completing this year's Great Leap Forward plan. It organizes special forums to ensure the technical revolution movement develops in an organized, targeted, and planned manner.

    This industrial bumper harvest field movement is being carried out on the basis of the previous phase of the technical revolution movement in Xi'an City. From June 21st to the end of July, Xi'an City workers launched the first high tide of the technical revolution movement centered on technical forums. In a short period of one and a half months, more than 15 million technical innovation proposals were put forward; some of the implemented proposals have increased work efficiency by thousands to millions of times, and have brought the quality of some products up to advanced international levels. What is especially important is that, through this movement, the workers' mysterious view of technology has been shattered, and the vast number of workers have established a daring and enterprising communist style.

    Technical forums have also raised many new problems, requiring a deeper and broader technical revolution movement to solve them. First, some of the 15 million proposals have not yet been processed, or have been processed but not implemented, or have been implemented but not widely promoted; some have been promoted but not widely enough, which cannot fully realize the value of the innovation proposals. Only a few individuals, a few lathes, or even a few groups have innovated technology, which cannot universally improve the production efficiency of the entire workshop or the entire factory, and achieve a bumper harvest. Second, although some key production problems have been solved in the technical forums, there are still some keys that have not been broken through, which are precisely the most important key problems with more technical difficulties. Without solving these problems, it is difficult to comprehensively improve the production efficiency of a workshop or even a factory. Third, some factory leaders had not had time in the previous stage to study well what problems needed to be solved in their factory and what goals needed to be achieved. They have not yet made plans to organize the masses in a planned and step-by-step manner to advance towards the established technical goals, and to completely change the face of the factories through technical revolution.

    After studying the above situation, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to carry out the industrial "bumper harvest field" movement in all factories in the city, in order to combine the three tasks of promoting innovation proposals, attacking key production problems, and formulating technical revolution plans, so as to achieve comprehensive improvement. Through this movement, the technical revolution and the completion of the Great Leap Forward tasks will be unified. To this end, the Municipal Committee requires:

    First, put politics in command, strengthen ideological work, resolutely overcome all existing right-leaning conservative ideas that hinder the technical revolution and the promotion of advanced experience, and vigorously promote mass movements. For example, textile workers proposed expanding looms and spindles, but the leaders of the textile system denied expanding looms and spindles; after the workers of State-owned Cotton Factory No. 5 created the "Dongfeng Weaving Method," which both expanded the looms and improved the quality, they restricted its promotion and strictly prohibited this weaving method from leaving State-owned Cotton Factory No. 5. The Municipal Committee requires the Party committees of each factory to wage a resolute struggle against similar ideas, support the enthusiasm of the masses, shout loudly for the new technologies and new experiences created by the masses, and further establish the authority of the daring and enterprising communist style.

    Second, strengthen the organizational leadership of processing, implementing, and promoting rationalization proposals, and combine the personal attention of Party and government leading cadres to major key proposals with the widespread mobilization of the masses to process proposals. In particular, it is necessary to seize the promotion of important technical innovation proposals and advanced experience, so that the level of all workers reaches the level of advanced workers. All major technical innovations and creations should be promoted by means of performances, visits, on-site meetings, exhibitions, etc., organized separately according to work types and industrial systems.

    Third, formulate a technical innovation plan as a program of action. This plan should absorb the existing technical achievements at home and abroad, and combine them with the specific conditions of the unit to determine the goals to be achieved in the technical revolution in the future. The plan should include: the development direction of the factory, product quality goals, new product trial production, production equipment, labor conditions, reform of operating methods and technological process routes, training of technical workers and cadres, comprehensive utilization of raw materials and substitutes, etc., which should not only have goals but also have specific measures and steps to achieve them. The plan should be earnestly discussed by the workers, and on the basis of the factory-wide plan, the plans of the workshops and groups should be formulated. In the discussion of the plan, each factory should focus on solving the current key production problems and improving production efficiency to complete this year's plan. In addition, the Municipal Committee also requires launching a high tide of learning and studying technology.

### 把技术革命同生产大跃进任务结合起来　西安开展工业大丰产运动

　　把技术革命同生产大跃进任务结合起来
　　西安开展工业大丰产运动
    本报西安17日电　记者伊晓报道：西安市职工正在开展一个工业上的大面积“丰产田”运动。把技术革命和完成跃进任务紧密结合到一起。这一运动是以处理、实现和推广技术革新建议，解决生产关键问题，完成今年跃进计划为目的的技术革命为中心，组织专题鸣放，使技术革命运动有组织、有目标、有计划地发展。
    这个工业上的丰产田运动是在前一段西安市技术革命运动的基础上开展的。西安市工人从6月21日到7月底，掀起了以技术鸣放为中心的技术革命运动的第一个高潮。在短短一个半月时间内，提出了一千五百多万条技术革新建议；已经实现的建议，有的提高工作效率几千倍到几百万倍，使若干产品的质量达到国际先进水平。尤其重要的是，通过这次运动，破除了工人对技术的神秘观点，广大职工树立了敢想敢干的共产主义风格。
    技术鸣放也提出了许多新的问题，要求更深更广地开展技术革命运动来加以解决。第一、这一千五百万条建议中，有一部分还没有处理，或者是处理了没有实现，或者实现了没有推广；有的是推而不广，这就不能充分发挥革新建议的价值。只有孤立的几个人、几台车床以至几个组革新了技术，还不能使整个车间、整个厂的生产效率普遍提高，达到丰产。第二、在技术鸣放中虽然已经解决了一些生产关键问题，但是还有一些关键没有突破，这也正是技术上困难较多的最重大的关键问题。不解决这些问题，也很难使一个车间以至一个厂的生产效率全面地提高。第三、有一部分厂的领导人员在前一阶段还没有来得及很好地研究在本厂到底要解决哪些问题，要达到什么目标。他们还没有作出规划，有计划有步骤地组织群众向既定的技术目标进军，通过技术革命来彻底改变各厂面貌。
    中共西安市委研究了上述情况以后，为了把推广革新建议，猛攻生产关键和制定技术革命规划三项任务结合到一起，达到全面提高的目的，提出要在全市各厂开展工业“丰产田”运动。通过这一运动，把技术革命和完成跃进任务统一起来。为此，市委要求：
    首先要政治挂帅，加强思想工作，坚决克服现存的妨碍技术革命和推广先进经验的一切右倾保守思想，大搞群众运动。例如，纺织工人提出了扩台扩锭，而纺织系统的领导人员却否定扩台扩锭；国棉五厂的工人创造了既扩了台又提高了质量的“东风织布工作法”以后，他们又限制推广，严禁这一织布工作法出国棉五厂。市委要求各厂党委要同类似的思想作坚决的斗争，支持群众的干劲，为群众创造的新技术、新经验大喊大叫，使敢想敢干的共产主义风格进一步确立威权。
    其次，要加强处理、实现和推广合理化建议的组织领导工作，把党、政领导干部亲自抓重大关键性建议，同广泛发动群众处理建议结合起来。特别要抓紧重要的技术革新建议和先进经验的推广，使全体工人的水平都达到先进者的水平。凡是重大的技术革新和创造，都应采取表演、参观、现场会议、展览等方法，按工种和产业系统分别组织推广。
    第三、制定技术革新规划，作为行动的纲领。这个规划应吸取国内外已有的技术成就，结合本单位具体情况，确定今后一定时期进行技术革命所要达到的目标。规划要包括：工厂的发展方向，产品质量目标、新产品试制、生产设备、劳动条件、操作方法和工艺规程路线的改革，技术工人和干部的培养，原材料的综合利用和代用品等问题，既要有奋斗目标，又要有具体措施和实现的步骤。规划要发动职工切实讨论，并在全厂规划的基础上制定车间、小组的规划。在讨论规划中，各厂要以解决当前生产关键问题，提高生产效率以完成今年计划为主。此外，市委还要求掀起一个学习和钻研技术的热潮。
