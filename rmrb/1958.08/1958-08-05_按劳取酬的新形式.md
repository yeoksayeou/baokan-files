    A New Form of Payment According to Labor
    Lin Zhong
    This year, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and other provinces have begun to implement payment according to output in a wider range of agricultural cooperatives. This is a relatively complete form of embodying the socialist principle of distribution according to labor. Compared with the past methods of contracting work and output, the "three guarantees," and "four guarantees" that were commonly used, this is a new and important development. It retains the useful parts of the contract work and output system (such as setting production and work quotas), eliminates the unreasonable parts of the contract work and output system (such as compensating for 20% of the reduction in production), and adapts the distribution and compensation system to the social requirements of improving the quality of cultivation and increasing output. At the same time, it is also easy to eliminate suspicions between production teams (suspicion that other teams have earned more work points), enhance unity, reduce the chores of cooperative cadres, and simplify the relationship between the cooperative and the teams. This adjustment in production relations is beneficial to the development of social productive forces. Therefore, it is also necessary and progressive.
    This method of payment according to output seems very similar to piece-rate wages in factories and enterprises. But in reality, it is different. First, piece-rate wages are directly paid to individuals, which can easily foster individualism; the work points obtained by payment according to output belong to the collective of the production team. Second, piece-rate wages can easily lead to a phenomenon of seeking quantity and not quality, while payment according to output promotes producers to pay attention to the quality of cultivation, otherwise they cannot produce more and therefore cannot obtain more work points. Third, piece-rate wages may hinder workers from studying and adopting new production technologies (fearing it will affect current personal income), while payment according to output can promote production teams to study and adopt new production technologies (which can improve efficiency, increase output, and overcome the difficulty of labor shortage). In addition, there are other differences.
    Judging from the situation of adopting the payment according to output system in Heilongjiang, most agricultural cooperatives have promoted production, and the peasants generally support it. However, there are also some issues that need attention. For example, some production teams, in order to produce more, are unwilling to fully implement the state's plans; some only care about the present and are unwilling to engage in long-term agricultural capital construction. These require continuous and reasonable adjustments in the work point remuneration for various crops and various agricultural labors. On the other hand, it is also necessary to continuously strengthen ideological and political work to improve the awareness of the cooperative members. Any good system can only fully play a positive role in promoting the development of productive forces under the condition of improved mass awareness. Conversely, if the mass awareness is not improved, then any good system will also produce some unexpected undesirable results, which can be said to be side effects.
    Of course, no one should think that as long as there is in-depth ideological and political work, the masses can unconditionally maintain full production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm forever. In fact, if the labor compensation and distribution system are unreasonable, for example, if the remuneration for good cultivation quality is low (less work points) and the remuneration for poor quality is high (more work points), then it cannot but affect the enthusiasm and initiative of production labor. What we call ideological and political work is ideological and political work on the basis of a basically reasonable production relationship and distribution system. Based on this consideration, payment according to output is a system that should be actively promoted at present. The specific practices in various places may be different, but the general principle must be this principle.

    按劳取酬的新形式
    林中
    黑龙江、山西等省今年开始在较大范围内的农业合作社中实行以产计酬，这是体现社会主义按劳取酬原则的较为完备的形式。与过去普遍采用的包工包产、三包、四包等办法相比，这是一个新的重要的发展。它保留了包工包产制的有用的部分（如定产定工），剔除了包工包产制中不合理的部分（如减产包赔20％之类），使分配和报酬制度适应于改善耕作质量，提高产量的社会要求。同时也易于消除各生产队之间的猜疑（猜疑别的队多挣了工分），增进团结；还减少了社干部的杂务，简化了社与队之间的关系。这种在生产关系方面所做的调整，对于社会生产力的发展是有利的。因此也就是必要的和进步的。
    这个以产计酬办法表面看去，很像是工厂企业中的计件工资。但实际上不一样。第一，计件工资是直接发给个人的，容易助长个人主义；以产计酬所得的工分则属于生产队集体。第二，计件工资容易产生求量不求质的现象，以产计酬却促使生产者必须注意耕作质量，否则不能多产，也就不能多得工分。第三，计件工资有可能妨碍工人研究和采用新的生产技术（怕影响当前个人收入），以产计酬却能促进各生产队研究和采用新的生产技术（可以提高效率，提高产量，克服人力不足的困难）。除此以外，还有其他的不同。
    从黑龙江采用以产计酬制的情况看，多数农业合作社都促进了生产，农民普遍拥护。但也有一些问题需要引起注意。比如有的生产队为了多产，不愿意完全执行国家的计划；有的只顾眼前，不愿意搞长期性的农业基本建设。这些，一方面需要在各种农作物和各种农业劳动的工分报酬上不断进行合理的调整，另方面也必须不断地加强思想政治工作，提高社员群众的觉悟程度。任何一种好的制度，都只有在群众觉悟提高的条件之下才能充分发挥促进生产力发展的正面作用。反之，群众觉悟不提高，则任何好的制度也会产生一部分料想不到的不良结果，也可以说是副作用。
    当然，任何人也不应该以为只要有了深入的思想政治工作，就可以无条件地使群众永远保持饱满的生产热情和政治热情。事实上，如果劳动报酬和分配制度不合理，比如耕作质量好的报酬少（工分少），质量不好的报酬多（工分多），那就怎么也不能不影响生产劳动的热情和积极性。我们所说的思想政治工作，是在生产关系和分配制度基本合理的基础上的思想政治工作。根据这种考虑，以产计酬在目前就是应当积极推广的一项制度。各地在具体做法上可以有所不同，但总的原则必须是这个原则。
