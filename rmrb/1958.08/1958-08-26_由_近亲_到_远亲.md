　　From "Close Relatives" to "Distant Relatives"
　　Yumin
　　Lenin wrote the following passage in his article "A Great Beginning":
　　"When ordinary workers rise up to overcome enormous difficulties, selflessly striving to increase labor productivity, striving to protect every pood of grain, coal, iron, and other products, these products are not owned by the workers themselves or their 'close relatives,' but by their 'distant relatives,' that is, by the whole of society... This is when communism begins." This is indeed the case. Social existence determines social consciousness. Private ownership separates people. Under the constraints of that system, people's vision is very short-sighted. They speak of "yours" and "mine," but never of "ours." This is particularly evident among the exploiting classes and their intellectuals: the relationships between people are nakedly based on money, on buying and selling. For a few stinking coins, they can "disown their relatives," that is, be estranged even from close kin. Now, the socialist system of public ownership closely links people together. People's minds are gradually opening up. They no longer regard "yours" and "mine" as important as they used to. They are beginning to understand that "when the big river has water, the small river is full; when the big river has no water, the small river dries up." Without the public, there is no private; without the big family, there is no small family; without "distant relatives," there are no "close relatives." "Ours," this is fundamental. In such a society, people, even if they are thousands of miles apart and have never met, will feel like old friends at first sight, that is, be close even though distant.
　　Aren't the thoughts and mental outlook of all of us undergoing dramatic changes with the great leap forward in social productive forces! Take cooperation as an example, the understanding and expression of people in the past year or so is very different, that is, there has been great progress.
　　Before the Great Leap Forward, there was an unhealthy trend of "buck-passing" and "passing the buck." Some people thought, "It's okay for you to support me, but not for me to support you." They hoarded large quantities of materials, calling it "being prepared for any emergency" and "the more the better," fearing to "expose their wealth" and "stand out," fearing "transfer," always trying to lay an "ambush" and "hold back." Some people, seeing others "searching high and low" wouldn't even give a hair. For example, according to a January 1957 inspection in Jiangsu Province, just in Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Nantong, and other twenty-four units, more than eight hundred and seventy tons of steel and more than three thousand cubic meters of wood were underreported or not reported at all. According to a simultaneous inspection in Shanxi Province, more than one thousand tons of steel and more than ten thousand cubic meters of wood were unreported. At that time, a supply and marketing section chief of Changzhou Dacheng Factory said: "It's better to have a surplus than a shortage. Where does the sense of responsibility come from without localism!" This can represent the state of mind of those who "pass the buck" and fear to "expose their wealth" at that time.
　　A year or so later, the situation is very different. The communist moral character of "everyone for me, me for everyone" is growing day by day, and the spirit of cooperation of "self-denial for others" is flourishing. For example, in order to support the industrial construction of the capital, central government agencies and municipal government agencies vacated 150,000 square meters of housing for use as factory buildings; Beijing Guomian United Textile Factory decided to take out more than 1,000 items of inventory materials worth 300,000 yuan..., such examples are everywhere. A commercial worker said: "Don't distinguish between whether you are industry or I am commerce, we are all the state." This is another state of mind.
　　On the one hand, there is the vigorous development of social productive forces, and on the other hand, there is the rapid growth of communist ideology. The situation we are currently facing is one of a double leap forward in production and ideology, and our country is a country with "both people and wealth." This wealth is the wealth of the socialist collective and the whole people; this person is the person who increasingly possesses communist spirit and style.
　　Then, for those who shout communist ideals but lack a communist spirit of cooperation in their actual actions, shouldn't there be a real change?

### 由“近亲”到“远亲”

　　由“近亲”到“远亲”
　　玉民
    列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中写过这样一段话：
  “当一般普通工人起来克服极大困难，奋不顾身地设法增加劳动生产率，设法保护每一普特粮食、煤、铁及其他产品，这些产品不是归劳动者本人及其‘近亲’所有，而是归他们的‘远亲’，即归全社会所有……这也就是共产主义开始了的时候。”事情确实是这样。社会存在决定社会意识。私有制把人们分开，在那种制度的束缚下，人们的眼光非常短浅，说起话来是“你的”、“我的”，就是没个“大家的”。这在剥削阶级同它们的知识分子中表现得特别明显：人们之间的关系是赤裸裸的金钱的关系、买卖的关系，为了几个臭钱，可以“六亲不认”，即虽亲而疏。如今，社会主义的公有制把人们紧密地联结起来。人们的思想逐渐开朗了，不再把“你的”“我的”看得像过去那么重了，人们开始懂得“大河有水小河满，大河无水小河干”，没有公就没有私，没有大家庭就没有小家庭，没有“远亲”就没有“近亲”，“大家的”，这才是根本。在这样的社会里，人们之间那怕千里迢迢，素不相识，也会一见如故，即虽远而亲。
    现在，我们大家的思想状况和精神面貌不是正在随着社会生产力的大飞跃发生着急剧的变化吗！就拿协作这一点来说，一年多以来，人们的理解和表现是大不相同了，即有了很大的进步。
    大跃进以前，曾经有“扯皮”、“踢皮球”的歪风，有些人是“你支援我行，我支援你不行”，他们大量积压材料，叫做“有备无患”、“多多益善”，怕“露富”、“冒尖”，怕“上调”，总想打点“埋伏”，“留一手”，有些人眼看别人“踏破铁鞋无觅处”也不肯拔一毛。比如据江苏省1957年1月的检查，仅南京、无锡、徐州、南通等二十四个单位，就少报漏报钢铁八百七十多吨，木材三千多立方公尺。据山西省同时期检查，漏报的钢材有一千多吨，木材一万多立方公尺。当时常州大成一厂有一位供销科长说：“积压总比脱销好，没有本位主义那来的责任心！”这可以代表当时“扯皮”者，怕“露富”者的思想状况。
    时隔一年多，情况大不相同了。“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义思想品格与日俱增，“克己为人”的协作之风大兴。比如为了支援首都的工业建设，中央机关、市级机关就腾出了十五万平方公尺的房屋留作厂房；北京国棉联纺厂决定拿出价值三十万元的库存物资一千多项……，这样的例子俯拾皆是。一位商业工作者说：“不要分你是工我是商，大家都是国家”。这又是一种思想状况。
    一方面是社会生产力的蓬勃发展，一方面是共产主义的思想迅速成长。我们目前所面临的局面正是生产和思想双跃进的局面，我们的国家正是“人财两旺”的国家。这财，就是社会主义集体和全民之财；这人，就是日益具备共产主义精神和风貌的人。
    那末，对于那些空喊共产主义理想，而又在实际行动上缺乏共产主义协作精神的人来说，不是应该有一个切实的改变了吗？
