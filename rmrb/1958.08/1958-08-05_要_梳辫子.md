    After the establishment of commune and township industries, the next issue to be resolved is to strengthen production management, rectify production order, and better serve agricultural production, so as to achieve mutual cooperation and common leaps forward between industry and agriculture.

    There are many aspects to strengthening management, which can be summarized into two main areas: political and ideological, and production organization. In the political and ideological aspect, workers must be educated to understand their position and the role their work plays in increasing agricultural production, thereby giving full play to their production enthusiasm and creativity, and using all their strength to complete production tasks. In terms of production organization, the first task is to do a good job of "braiding the hair," weaving scattered small factories into one braid or several braids; at the same time, the township's production leadership structure should be strengthened to unify planning and overall arrangements. In this way, all production management problems can be addressed.

    The reason why the local industry of Weixian County, Hebei Province, has changed from a chaotic state to a state of sound management and normal production is because they braided two braids. Places that have not braided their hair may refer to the practices of Weixian County.

### 要“梳辫子”

    要“梳辫子”
    乡、社工业办起来以后，紧接着要解决的问题，就是加强生产管理，整顿生产秩序，更好地为农业生产服务，做到工业、农业互相配合，共同跃进。
    加强管理的内容很多，归纳起来，不外两个方面，一个是政治思想方面的，另一个是生产组织方面的。在政治思想方面，一定要教育工人明白自己所处的地位以及自己所担负的工作在农业增产中的作用，从而发挥生产积极性和创造性，用尽一切力量完成生产任务。在生产组织方面，首先要做好“梳辫子”的工作，把分散的小工厂编成一条辫子或几条辫子；同时，把乡的生产领导机构健全起来，统一规划，统筹安排。这样，生产管理上的一切问题就可以抓得起来了。
    河北魏县的地方工业由混乱状态一变而为管理健全，生产正常的状态，就是因为他们梳起了两根辫子，没有梳辫子的地方，不妨参考魏县的做法。
