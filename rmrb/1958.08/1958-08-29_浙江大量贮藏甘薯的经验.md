　　Solving the problem of sweet potato storage is an important link in increasing sweet potato production and ensuring harvest. To this end, the Zhejiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has researched and developed the rectangular shallow cellar storage method and the ground stacking method, effectively guaranteeing the safe storage of sweet potatoes in areas with high water tables and low-lying areas.

　　Rectangular Shallow Cellar Storage Method
　　This method can effectively control storage conditions such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation, ensuring safe storage in large quantities. The specific steps are:
　　Choose a high, dry, solid, well-drained, sheltered, sunny, and easily accessible location. Calculate the volume of the pit according to the standard of 41 to 43 jin of sweet potatoes stored per cubic foot. To store 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes, a cellar pit approximately 12 chi long, 5 chi wide, and 3.5 chi deep (Chinese feet, same below) is required.
　　At both ends of the cellar pit, build triangular earthen walls, 2.5 chi high, with one or two ventilation holes on the wall surface. Place five mao bamboo or wooden beams on the walls, and set up an A-shaped fork frame in the middle. Cover the top of the cellar with a layer of grass and then cover it with 1 to 1.3 chi of soil. Install a cellar door and a thermometer tube on each side of the cellar top. A cellar top of this thickness can maintain a cellar temperature above 10 degrees Celsius even when the temperature drops to minus 10 degrees Celsius. After the cellar top is covered, immediately dig drainage ditches around it to prevent rainwater from entering the cellar.
　　During the sweet potato storage period, the physiological changes of the sweet potatoes are different, and the management requirements are also different. Therefore, management should be carried out in stages:
　　Early Stage Management: The period from entering the cellar to sealing the cellar is defined as the early stage. During this period, the sweet potatoes respire vigorously and the cellar temperature is high. In terms of management, ventilation should be done well to promote rapid healing of wounds. However, the cellar door and ventilation holes should not be opened for a long time to avoid dry rot. During this period, the cellar temperature should be controlled below 18 degrees Celsius.
　　Mid-Stage Management: The period from sealing the cellar to the Great Cold solar term is defined as the mid-stage. When the cellar temperature is consistently below 14 degrees Celsius, the cellar can be sealed. The sealing method is to drive a row of wooden stakes about 2 chi apart at both ends of the cellar, surround them with rice straw, and compact the soil. When sealing the cellar, if the sweet potatoes are shriveled, spray warm water equal to 0.5% of the weight of the sweet potatoes to increase the humidity inside the sweet potato pile. After sealing the cellar, if the cellar temperature rises above 18 degrees Celsius temporarily, open the thermometer hole to dissipate some of the heat. When the cellar temperature returns to normal, close the thermometer hole again. When it snows, promptly remove the snow accumulated on the cellar top to prevent snow water from seeping in. Throughout the mid-stage, the cellar temperature should be maintained at 10 to 16 degrees Celsius to prevent it from consistently falling below 9 degrees Celsius.
　　Late Stage Management: The period from the Beginning of Spring solar term to opening the cellar is defined as the late stage. During this period, the air and cellar temperatures rise. Open the thermometer hole every three to five days to lower the cellar temperature.
　　During the storage period, inspection work should also be emphasized. In the early stage, pay attention to observing the degree of wound healing. If the wound forms a white, hard scar, it indicates good storage. If the wound has black spots, it is mostly caused by poor ventilation and should be immediately improved. Fresh and moist potato skin is a symbol of proper humidity. Dry, white skin, with individual sweet potatoes showing signs of shrinkage at the ends, indicates that the humidity is too low and water should be sprayed to replenish moisture. In the mid and late stages, if the sweet potatoes have dull skin, discoloration of the skin, and little sap, it indicates that they have suffered from cold damage and should be quickly picked out. Thicken the covering grass and increase the cellar temperature, especially during the severe cold in January. Before sunrise in the morning, check the outside of the cellar for wet soil or places where heat is escaping. If there are any, promptly block and seal them to maintain the cellar temperature. This storage method has been promoted in Yuhang, Wuxing, Hangxian, Jinhua, Jiaxing, and other places since 1954 and has performed well. The general storage rot rate does not exceed 1%.

　　Ground Stacking Method
　　This storage method saves labor, materials, and land. The specific steps are as follows:
　　Choose a well-drained, sheltered, sunny place and dig a rectangular shallow pit, 12 chi long, 10 chi wide, and 1 chi deep, which can store 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes. Lay a layer of rice straw on the bottom and sides of the pit.
　　Fill the rectangular shallow pit with the selected sweet potatoes, and then use long, large sweet potatoes to build the edges, gradually shrinking inward to form a trapezoidal pile. The top is 2 chi wide. The slope of the pile should be 45 to 50 degrees on the northwest-facing side, so that more soil can be added for better insulation. The leeward side can be steeper. The pile should be 3 to 3.5 chi high, not too high, to avoid difficulties in adding soil for insulation.
　　On the same day or the next day after stacking, cover the outside of the pile with a thin layer of rice straw and add fine soil 4 to 5 cun thick. The height reaches two-thirds of the pile height, leaving one-third un-covered with soil to facilitate ventilation. Cover the top of the pile with rice straw or wheat straw, with a thickness that prevents rainwater from leaking. After five or six days, perform a second soil addition. Continue to add fine soil to the top on the basis of the first soil addition, which is easy to maintain humidity. The top is not covered with soil. At this time, the upper part of the pile slope is 3 to 4 cun thick, and the lower part is 7 to 8 cun thick. Place vertical and horizontal grass bundles or cover with straw curtains on the top of the pile, and then cover with rice straw or wheat straw to prevent rain. Install a thermometer tube (same as rectangular shallow cellar) on the side of the pile, passing through the pile, to measure the pile temperature. When the pile temperature is consistently between 14 and 16 degrees Celsius, remove the vertical and horizontal grass bundles or straw curtains on the top of the pile and cover with another layer of rice straw. When the pile temperature is consistently below 14 degrees Celsius, start adding soil to the top of the pile. Add 1 to 2 cun thick for the first time. Later, if the pile temperature drops again, continue to thicken the soil and try to keep the pile temperature at 10 to 16 degrees Celsius. If it drops below 9 degrees Celsius, thicken the soil around the pile and try to compact it. Practice has proven that adding 1.3 to 1.5 chi thick soil around the pile and covering it with 5 to 6 cun thick rice straw can maintain the pile temperature above 10 degrees Celsius even when the temperature drops to minus 10 degrees Celsius, ensuring that the sweet potatoes will not freeze. After the beginning of spring, when the air and pile temperatures rise, gradually reduce the soil addition and covering grass on the top of the pile in batches to lower the pile temperature. Stacking sweet potatoes also requires attention to inspection work. The inspection points are the same as the rectangular shallow cellar storage method. This storage method has been promoted in Xiaoshan, Ruian, Jinhua, and other places since 1955, and the rot rate generally does not exceed 1%. (Attached pictures)

专栏：几种窖藏甘薯的办法

　　浙江大量贮藏甘薯的经验
    浙江省农业科学研究所　徐国光
    解决甘薯的贮藏问题，是甘薯增产保产中的重要环节。为此，浙江省农业科学研究所研究出长方形浅窖贮藏法和地面堆藏法。有效地保证地下水位高和低洼地区的甘薯贮藏安全。
    长方形浅窖贮藏法
    这种办法可以有效地控制温度、湿度、通风等贮藏条件，保证大量贮藏安全，具体做法是：
    选择地势高燥、土壤坚实、排水良好、避风向阳及运输管理方便之处，按照每立方尺贮藏薯块四十一斤到四十三斤的标准计算容积挖坑。贮藏甘薯一万斤，约需长十二尺，宽五尺，深三点五尺（市尺，下同）的窖坑。
    在窖坑两头，筑成三角形土墙，墙高二点五尺，墙面留一、二个通气孔，墙上搁置毛竹或木杆梁椽五根，中部设置人字形叉架，窖顶上盖草一层，复土一至一点三尺厚，并在窖顶两边各装置窖门和测温筒一个。这样厚的窖顶，即使气温低到零下十度，还可保持窖温在十度以上。窖顶盖好后，随即在四周开好排水沟，防止雨水进入窖内。
    甘薯贮藏期间薯块的生理变化不同，在管理要求上也就不一样，因此，应分期进行管理：
    前期管理：从下窖到封窖定为前期。这一时期，薯块呼吸旺盛，窖温高，在管理方面要做好通风换气工作，促使伤口愈合快。但也不可把窖门和通气孔长期打开，以免引起干腐现象。这一期间窖温，应控制在十八度以下。
    中期管理：从封窖到大寒定为中期。当窖温经常低到十四度以下，就可以封窖。封窖方法，在窖的两头，各距二尺左右打一排木桩，内围稻草，培土打实。在封窖时，如果薯块有干缩情况，可酌喷为甘薯重量0.5％的温水，以提高甘薯堆内湿度。封窖之后，如窖温一时上升到十八度以上，应把测温孔打开，散发部分热气，等到窖温正常，再把测温孔闭塞。落雪时，要及时扫除窖顶积雪，防止雪水渗入。整个中期窖温，应保持十到十六度，防止经常低于九度以下。
    后期管理：从立春到开窖定为后期。这一时期，气温窖温上升，应隔三、五天打开测温孔一次，降低窖温。
    在贮藏期间，还应重视检查工作。前期注意观察伤口愈合程度，凡伤口结成白色硬疤的，表示贮藏良好。如果伤口有黑点，多为通风换气不良所引起，应立即改善通风条件。薯皮鲜润，为湿度适当的象征。皮色干白，个别薯块头尾有干缩现象的，证明湿度太低，要进行喷水补湿，中后期的薯块，如果有皮色暗淡，皮部变色，浆水少的情况，证明受过冷害，应从速拣出这一类的坏薯块，加厚盖草，提高窖温，尤其在1月间天气严寒，早晨日出前，应检查窖外有无湿土和冒热气之处，如有，要及时堵塞打结，保持窖温。这一贮藏方法，从1954年起，先后在余杭、吴兴、杭县、金华、加兴等地推广，表现良好，一般贮藏腐烂率不超过1％。
    地面堆藏法
    这一贮藏方法，省工、省料、省地皮。具体做法如下：
    选择排水良好，避风向阳之处，挖一长方形浅坑，长十二尺，宽十尺，深一尺，可以堆藏甘薯一万斤。坑底和四边铺一层稻草。
    把选好的薯块放满长方形浅坑，然后用长大薯块砌边，逐步向内缩进，迭成梯形堆。顶宽二尺。堆的坡度，迎西北风一面为四十五到五十角度，这样容易多培土，更好地保温。背风的一面，可以陡一点。堆高三至三点五尺，不宜过高，以免培土保温困难。
    堆好当天或第二天，在堆外面薄盖一层稻草，培细土四、五寸厚。高度达堆高三分之二，空留三分之一不培土，便于通风换气。堆顶盖稻草或麦草，厚度以不漏雨水为原则。过五、六天进行第二次培土，在第一次培土基础上，继续培细土到顶，这样容易保持湿度。顶上不培土。此时堆坡上部厚三、四寸，下部厚七至八寸。堆顶放纵横草把或盖草帘，外再盖稻草或麦草防雨。堆边装置测温筒（同长方形浅窖），通过堆内，以便测量堆温。当堆温经常在十四至十六度时，就要去掉堆顶上纵横草把或草帘，另盖一层稻草。等到堆温经常低于十四度，开始在堆顶上培土。第一次培一至二寸厚。后来堆温再下降，就继续加厚，经常保持堆温十至十六度。如果低到九度以下，再加厚堆边培土并竭力打实。实践证明，堆边培土一点三至一点五尺厚，外面盖稻草五至六寸厚，即使气温低到零下十度，还可保持堆温在十度以上，保证甘薯不会受冻。开春之后，气温堆温升高，应分批削减堆顶培土和盖草，以降低堆温。堆藏甘薯，也要重视检查工作。检查要点，同长方形浅窖贮藏法。这一贮藏方法，从1955年起先后在肖山、瑞安、金华等地推广，腐烂率一般不超过1％。（附图片）
