　　Building Housing Quickly and Well
A mass movement to build housing quickly, well, and economically is underway throughout Romania. Factory workers at many construction project sites are also actively participating in voluntary labor to build housing.

After the central government delegated most construction companies to the leadership of the state people's councils at the beginning of this year, the state party committees successively convened expanded meetings in April and May, attended by construction site party committee secretaries, construction workers, engineers, and others, to discuss implementing the principles of "fast, good, and economical" in housing construction. The meetings decided to reduce the cost of each housing unit from the original 80,000 to 120,000 lei (Romanian currency) to 45,000 to 50,000 lei.

The work team led by An. Weiber, an advanced bricklayer in the Fourth Engineering Team of Hunedoara State, first proposed the socialist labor competition slogan of building housing quickly, well, and economically. They implemented contracting, organized comprehensive work teams, and adopted assembly line methods, ensuring no idleness or wasted materials. The advanced example of An. Weiber's work team attracted the attention of construction workers nationwide, thereby triggering a new upsurge in the socialist competition.

In order to achieve greater success in the movement to build housing quickly, well, and economically, the local party committees have decided to strengthen leadership over construction work, improve housing design, and use local materials to further reduce housing construction costs.

### ·罗马尼亚·　又快又好地建筑住宅

　　·罗马尼亚·
　　又快又好地建筑住宅
    罗马尼亚全国正开展一个快、好、省地建筑住宅的群众运动。许多建筑工程所在地的工厂职工也积极参加了建筑住宅的义务劳动。
    今年年初，中央把大部分建筑公司下放给州人民会议领导之后，各州党委在4、5月间先后召开了有工地党委书记、建筑工人、工程师等人参加的扩大会议，讨论了在住宅建筑中贯彻“快、好、省”的方针。会议上决定把每套住宅的造价由原来的八万至十二万列伊（罗币）降低为四万五千到五万列伊。
    洪尼多阿拉州第四工程队先进砌砖工人安·维伯尔领导的工作队首先提出了又快又好又省地建筑住宅的社会主义劳动竞赛口号。他们实行了包工，组织全面工作队，采取流水作业法，作到了不窝工、不浪费材料。安·维伯尔工作队的先进事例引起了全国建筑工人的重视，从而掀起了社会主义竞赛新的高潮。
    为了使快、好、省地建筑住宅的运动取得更大的成就，各地党委已经决定加强对建筑工作的领导，并且将设法改进住宅的设计工作和作到就地取材，以便进一步降低住宅的造价。（附图片）
