　　Another Province Yielding 1,000 Jin of Early Rice

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 23rd: Another province yielding 1,000 jin of early rice has emerged in our country – Jiangsu Province. Currently, all 2.6 million mu of early rice across the province have been harvested, with a total output of 2,636.44 million jin, an average yield of 1,014 jin per mu, representing an increase of 1.4 times compared to last year.

　　This year, early rice was planted in five special districts and forty-six counties and cities in Jiangsu Province, among which seventeen counties and cities, including Nanhui, Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian, Xinghua, and Jiangdu, achieved yields of over 1,000 jin. In addition, there are many townships and communes with high yields. According to statistics from fourteen counties, there are a total of seventy-six townships with an average yield of over 1,200 jin per mu. Among them, fourteen townships achieved yields of over 1,500 jin per mu, and six townships achieved yields of over 1,600 jin per mu. Furthermore, according to statistics from fourteen counties, there are one hundred and eighty-four high-yield communes with an average yield of over 1,600 jin per mu, among which twenty-nine communes reached over 2,000 jin.

　　The reason why double-cropping early rice in Jiangsu Province has made such a great leap forward this year is due to the timely breaking of superstitions and the continuous elimination of conservative thinking by the broad masses of cadres and people under the leadership of the Party. Since liberation, although rice production has increased year by year, the average annual increase has been only a few percent. Last year, the average yield per mu in the province was only over 350 jin. Therefore, the idea that early rice has a short growing period and its yield is difficult to increase has been circulating among cadres and the masses. In order to break the superstition that rice production can only advance slowly and cannot leap forward, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee put forward the fighting slogan of "catching up with wheat with rice, and doubling rice production" as early as the beginning of March this year, and the Party committees of twenty-three townships in Changshu County challenged the Party committees of all townships in the province. Although many people expressed their support, a considerable number of people expressed doubts; some simply did not believe it, saying that doubling rice production was "a toad wanting to eat swan meat." A few areas with less labor and poorer soil conditions held on to vulgar conditionalism, believing that others could double, but they could not. Under this very sharp situation of struggle between advanced and backward ideas, the rural areas throughout the province launched a great debate around "whether to double, whether it is possible to double, and how to double." Through this great debate, the broad masses of cadres and people broke superstitions and were determined to make a great leap forward. By April 3rd, 620 townships across the province had openly responded to the challenge from the twenty-three townships in Changshu County, turning "catching up with wheat with rice, and doubling rice production" into a huge material force. Under the slogan of "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of effort," the majority of areas have achieved early rice dense planting of about 50,000 holes, four to five times more than in the past. Various regions have universally implemented technical innovation measures such as early planting, deep plowing, and sufficient fertilizer for early rice. In addition, various regions have also effectively strengthened the late-stage management of early rice.

　　The area of early rice in Jiangsu Province accounts for 4.4% of the province's autumn-ripening crops, and the focus of the province's agricultural increase is still on medium and late autumn crops. Now, the five levels of cadres in the province are adopting the method of checking while working and checking while laboring, going deep into the fields, and leading the farmers of the province to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn-ripening crops.

### 又一早稻千斤省

　　又一早稻千斤省
    据新华社南京23日电　我国又出现了一个早稻千斤省——江苏省。现在，全省二百六十万亩早稻已全部登场，总产量二十六亿三千六百四十万斤，平均亩产一千零一十四斤，比去年增产一点四倍。
    江苏省今年种植早稻的共有五个专区，四十六个县市，其中千斤以上的县市有南汇、松江、金山、奉贤、兴化、江都等十七个县市。除此之外，还有许多高额丰产的乡社。据十四个县的统计，平均亩产一千二百斤以上的乡，共有七十六个。其中有十四个乡，亩产一千五百斤以上，有六个乡亩产一千六百斤以上。又据十四个县统计，平均亩产达到一千六百斤以上的高产社有一百八十四个，其中有二十九个社达到二千斤以上。
    江苏省今年双季早稻所以能够大跳特跳，这是由于广大干部群众在党的领导下，及时破除迷信、不断扫除保守思想的结果。解放以来，水稻产量虽然逐年增加，但是每年平均递增不过百分之几，去年全省平均亩产只有三百五十多斤，因此，干部群众中一直流传着早稻生长期短、产量难以提高的论调。为了破除水稻生产只能缓进不能跃进的迷信，早在今年3月初，江苏省委就提出了“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”的战斗口号，并由常熟县的二十三个乡党委向全省各乡党委提出挑战。虽然许多人表示拥护，但也有相当多的一部分人表示怀疑；有些人根本不相信，说水稻翻一番是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。少数劳力较少、土质较差的地区，更是抱住庸俗的条件论，认为别处能翻，本地不能翻。在这种先进思想和落后思想斗争十分尖锐的情况之下，全省农村都围绕“要不要翻、能不能翻、怎样才能翻”，展开了大鸣大放大辩论。经过这场大辩论，广大干部群众破除了迷信，下定了大跳特跳的决心。到4月3日，全省有六百二十个乡，向常熟县二十三个乡公开应战，把“三麦赶水稻，水稻翻一番”变成了巨大的物质力量。各地群众在“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的口号下，多数地区早稻密植都达到五万穴左右，比过去翻了四、五倍。各地区普遍贯彻了早稻早栽、深耕、足肥等技术革新措施。此外，各地还切实加强了早稻的后期管理工作。
    江苏省早稻面积占全省秋熟粮食作物的4.4％，全省农业增产的重点还在中晚秋作物方面。现在，全省五级干部正采取边查边干、边查边劳动的方法，深入田间，带领全省农民，力争秋熟作物全面大丰收。
