Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 8th. The 1958 National Navigation Multi-Sport Competition concluded victoriously today after seven days of intense competition.

This competition included eight events (six for women): sampan rowing, sampan sailing, tug-of-war, semaphore communication, combined rowing and sailing race, combined climbing, and heaving line throwing. The competitive achievements in each sport were significantly improved compared to the 1956 Navigation Sports Competition. Taking heaving line throwing as an example, the top six individual scores all exceeded the highest score of the previous Navigation Games.

Throughout the competition, athletes from all over the country were full of energy, striving for the top, and working hard to create excellent results. The Shandong women's team, with its strong physique and superb skills, won five championships in the six competitions. Representative teams from Yunnan, Jiangxi, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where navigation sports started later, also achieved good results due to their hard training. While competing intensely, the athletes also promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, and exchanged experiences and techniques, which led to a general improvement in the level of all the teams participating in the Games.

Yan Chao, the person in charge of the conference, pointed out in his closing speech: The achievements of this competition have shown that China's navigation sports are developing vigorously. He asked athletes from all over the country to bring back the spirit and achievements of the conference, actively seek the support of relevant departments and stationed troops, better develop national defense sports and navigation sports, and strive to achieve the sports goals put forward by the Party and the country, and to cultivate a strong naval reserve force for the motherland!

On the eve of the closing of the sports conference, Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the Sports Commission, who was in Qingdao, met with all the athletes. He encouraged the athletes to break superstitions, have confidence in the competition, and have the idea of "striving for first place"; at the same time, they must guard against arrogance and rashness, intensify training, and strive to achieve better results in the National Comprehensive Sports Conference next year to report to the Party and Chairman Mao.

    海军后备力量大检阅
    全国航海多项运动竞赛会闭幕
    据新华社青岛8日电　1958年全国航海多项运动竞赛大会经过七天的紧张比赛，今天胜利闭幕。
    这次大会，共进行了舢舨荡桨、舢舨驶帆、拔河、手旗通讯、荡桨驶帆综合竞赛、综合攀登和撇缆等八个项目（女子六个项目）。各项运动的竞赛成就都比1956年航海运动竞赛大会有显著提高。以撇缆为例，个人成绩前六名，全部超过了上届航海运动会的最高成绩。
    在整个竞赛过程中，来自各地的运动员们都鼓足干劲，力争上游，努力创造优秀成绩。身体强壮技术高超的山东女子代表队在六项竞赛中，夺得了五项冠军。云南、江西和广西僮族自治区等开展航海运动较晚的地区代表队，由于刻苦锻炼，也获得了较好的成绩。运动员们在紧张竞赛的同时，还发扬了互助友爱精神，交流了经验和技术，因而使参加运动会的所有代表队的水平，都获得了普遍提高。
    大会负责人阎超在闭幕词中指出：这次竞赛大会的成就，已经显示出我国的航海运动正在蓬勃地向前发展，他要求来自各地的运动员们把大会的精神和成就带回去，主动争取有关部门和驻军的支持，更好地开展国防体育和航海运动，为早日实现党和国家提出的运动目标、为祖国培养雄厚的海军后备力量而奋斗！
    运动大会闭幕前夕，正在青岛的体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩，接见了全体运动员。他勉励运动员们要破除迷信，比赛要有信心，要有“争取第一”的思想；同时还要戒骄戒躁，加紧锻炼，争取在明年举行的全国综合运动大会上，拿出更优良的成绩来，向党向毛主席汇报。（附图片）
