　　Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, Tokyo dispatch: The Kishida Nobusuke government, embarrassed by the Japanese people's struggle against the import of "Oerlikon 56" missiles into Japan, today adopted fraudulent tricks to smuggle the main components of the "Oerlikon 56" missiles from the back door of the Yokosuka Naval Base to Tokyo.

　　Since yesterday, pickets composed of Japanese workers and students who opposed the import of "Oerlikon 56" missiles have been closely monitoring the main gates and exits of the Yokosuka Naval Base. The picket's monitoring made the "Maritime Self-Defense Force" unwilling to openly transport the missiles. Under these circumstances, the Kishida Nobusuke government actually resorted to the trickery of swindlers. At 4:00 PM today, the Yokosuka Naval Authorities disseminated news to reporters saying, "As long as the picket does not disband, the 'Oerlikon 56' missiles will not be transported until September 3rd." However, immediately after this news was announced, approximately 300 police officers surrounded the picket in front of the main gate. At this moment, the "Maritime Self-Defense Force" used trucks to sneak the main parts of the missiles out of the back door of the Yokosuka base, like thieves.

　　This batch of missiles purchased by the Kishida Nobusuke government from Switzerland, because dockworkers refused to unload them and the Japanese people resolutely opposed their import into Japan, forced the Japanese "Defense Agency" to use warships to unload them themselves at the Yokosuka Naval Base, and then secretly transported them by military trucks in two batches from Yokosuka to the "Defense Agency's" First Technical Research Institute in Meguro, Tokyo.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo on the 25th: Today, the Japanese people held a large-scale mass meeting in Yokohama Port to protest the unloading of missiles. More than 1,500 representatives from labor unions, the Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, various democratic organizations, and youth and students attended the mass meeting.

　　The participants of the conference passed a resolution calling on the Japanese working class and the people of the entire country to rise up against the plan to revive Japanese militarism. After the mass meeting, the participants held a protest march on the streets of Yokohama.

　　Nearly one hundred people will go to Yokosuka to participate in a sit-down strike, which is being held by workers and democratic organizations in front of the headquarters building of the Japanese "Maritime Self-Defense Force."

　　偷运导弹不择手段
    岸信介政府鬼计多端
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：被日本人民反对把“厄利康五六”型导弹运入日本的斗争搞得狼狈不堪的岸信介政府，今天采取欺诈的诡计把“厄利康五六”型导弹的主要组成部分从横须贺海军基地的后门偷运到东京。
    由日本工人和学生组成的反对运进“厄利康五六”型导弹的纠察队从昨天开始一直严密地监视着横须贺海军基地的大门和主要出口。纠察队的监视使“海上自卫队”不敢公然把导弹运走。在这种情况下，岸信介政府居然耍弄骗子的手腕。今天下午四点，横须贺海军当局向新闻记者散布消息说，“只要纠察队不解散，在9月3日以前将不搬运‘厄利康五六’型导弹。”但是，这个消息公布后，立即约有三百名警察包围了大门前面的纠察队。就在这个时候，“海上自卫队”像小偷似地用卡车把导弹主要部分从横须贺基地的后门逃掉。
    岸信介政府从瑞士买来的这批导弹，由于码头工人拒绝卸运和日本人民坚决反对运进日本，日本“防卫厅”只好自己用军舰卸运到横须贺海军基地，然后又用军用卡车分两次偷偷地从横须贺运到东京目黑的“防卫厅”第一技术研究所。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社东京25日讯：日本人民今天在横滨港举行了大规模的群众大会，抗议卸运导弹。参加群众大会的有一千五百多名工会、禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、各民主团体和青年学生的代表。
    大会参加者通过决议，号召日本工人阶级和全国人民起来反对复活日本军国主义的计划。在群众大会之后，大会的参加者在横滨的街道上举行了抗议游行。
    将近一百人将到横须贺参加静坐罢工，这次罢工是工人和民主团体在日本“海上自卫队”总部大楼前举行的。
