Hot-Rolled Gear Manufacturing: Tenfold Increase in Efficiency
Tianjin and Other Places Master World’s New Technology Using Indigenous Methods

(Report from this newspaper) A new global technology—manufacturing gears using hot rolling—has been mastered by many factories in our country using indigenous methods. The First Ministry of Machine Building recently held an on-site meeting at the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to promote this new hot-rolled gear technology.

Gears are important components of machine transmission systems; almost all machines require gears. Because of their important position in the machinery industry, gear patterns are often used as symbols of the machinery industry. Gear production typically uses cutting methods, slowly milling with milling machines, which results in low production efficiency. Since the Great Leap Forward, the tasks of the machinery industry have become heavier. To produce more machines requires producing more gears, and producing more gears requires more gear processing machine tools. However, the current number of machine tools in our country falls far short of meeting the needs. To resolve this contradiction, new technologies must be adopted to produce large quantities of products with a small number of machine tools.

Hot-rolled gear manufacturing is a new technology that uses pressure processing methods instead of cutting methods to manufacture gears. Adopting hot-rolled gear manufacturing can increase labor productivity by tenfold to fortyfold, thereby overcoming the shortage of machine tools, producing large batches of gears with very few machine tools, and saving cutting tools and power consumption. Moreover, because the gears are rolled directly, the metal fibers are not cut, the surface layer is finer, and the mechanical properties are greatly improved, correspondingly increasing the service life of the gears. In addition, since no cutting is required, metal materials can also be saved.

Currently, countries around the world are vigorously engaged in research on hot-rolled gears. In 1957, China's Machinery Industry Forging and Pressing Coordination Conference also decided to include hot-rolled gears as one of the key research topics. However, due to the lack of ideological liberation at the time, it was generally believed that such new technologies could only be studied by a few experts, resulting in slow progress. After the Great Leap Forward, increasing gear production efficiency became an urgent task. The Shenyang Liming Machinery Factory, Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Tianjin Tractor Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Dalian Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, among others, mobilized the masses to research hot-rolled gears and successively achieved success. Among them, the Tianjin Tractor Factory only spent five days rolling out qualified gears.

Hot-rolled gear manufacturing is a new global technology, a "foreign" method. In the past, people always thought that it required special equipment and high-frequency heating. However, based on actual conditions, our factories have mastered foreign technology using indigenous methods. In terms of equipment, in addition to a few factories having specialized equipment, many factories have adopted ordinary machine tools such as lathes and grinders that have been modified. In terms of heating methods, in addition to a few factories using high-frequency heating, many factories have adopted simple methods such as flame heating and contact heating. This makes this global technology universally applicable in our country.

The successful trial rolling of hot-rolled gears is of great significance to the technological revolution of the entire machinery industry. Using hot processing methods such as casting and forging to replace cold processing (cutting) methods, thereby shortening the production process and increasing production efficiency, is the development trend of the machinery industry. The successful trial rolling of hot-rolled gears shows that many other parts in the machinery industry can also use the same methods to increase production efficiency.

### 热轧造齿轮　功效大十倍  天津等地用土办法掌握了世界新技术

　　热轧造齿轮　功效大十倍
    天津等地用土办法掌握了世界新技术
    本报讯　一种世界新技术——用热轧的办法生产齿轮，已经被我国的许多工厂用土办法掌握了。第一机械工业部最近在天津第一机床厂召开现场会议，推广这种热轧齿轮的新技术。
    齿轮是机器传动装置的重要组成部分，差不多所有的机器都要有齿轮。由于它在机械工业中占有重要的位置，人们常常用齿轮的图案作为机械工业的标志。齿轮的生产通常都采用切削加工的方法，用铣床慢慢地铣，生产效率很低。大跃进以来，机械工业的任务加重，要生产更多的机器就要生产更多的齿轮，要生产更多的齿轮就需要更多的齿轮加工机床。而目前我国的机床数量远远不能满足需要，解决这个矛盾，就必须采用新的技术，用少量的机床生产大量的产品。
    热轧齿轮是用压力加工的方法代替切削加工的方法制造齿轮的一种新技术。采用热轧齿轮的办法，可以提高劳动生产率十倍至四十倍，因而能够解决机床不足的困难，用很少的机床生产大批的齿轮，并节约切削工具和动力的消耗。而且，由于齿轮是直接轧出来的，金属纤维没有被切断，表面层较细密，机械性能大大提高，相应的提高了齿轮的使用寿命。此外，由于不需经过切削加工，还可以节约金属材料。
    目前，世界各国都在大力从事热轧齿轮的研究工作。1957年我国机械工业锻压协调会议也决定把热轧齿轮列为重点研究课题之一。但由于当时思想没有解放，总以为像这样的新技术只能由少数专家去研究，因而进展缓慢。大跃进以后，提高齿轮生产效率迫不容缓。沈阳黎明机器厂、天津第一机床厂、天津拖拉机厂、太原矿山机器厂、大连机床厂、上海机床厂和沈阳第三机床厂等单位纷纷发动群众研究热轧齿轮，相继取得成功。其中天津拖拉机厂仅用五天时间便轧出合格的齿轮。
    热轧齿轮是世界新技术，是“洋”办法。过去人们总认为非有专用设备、非用高频加热不可。可是，我们的工厂根据实际情况，用土办法掌握了洋技术。从设备来看，除少数工厂有专用设备外，许多厂是采用车床、磨床等普通机床改装的。从加热方法来看，除少数厂采用高频加热外，许多工厂都采用火焰加热，接触加热等简单的办法。这就使得这种世界上的新技术在我国有了普遍推广的条件。
    热轧齿轮试轧成功，对整个机械工业的技术革命有重大意义。用铸、锻等热加工的方法来代替冷加工（切削加工）的方法，从而缩短生产过程，提高生产效率，是机械工业的发展趋势，热轧齿轮试轧成功，说明机械工业上的其他许多零件也可以用同样的方法来提高生产效率。
