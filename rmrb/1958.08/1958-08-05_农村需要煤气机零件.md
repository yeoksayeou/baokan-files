    Rural Areas Need Gas Engine Parts
    The "fire piston rings" of two gas engines in our township's Yugu Agricultural Cooperative and Dahuaishu Agricultural Cooperative are broken and cannot be started. People were sent to Luoyang and Zhengzhou to buy them, but they could not be found. Later, they traveled a long distance by train to the Tianjin Gas Engine Factory to request assistance, but this factory could not supply such parts either. As a result, these two gas engines could not be used because they could not be fitted with parts. At present, the task of irrigation and drainage in rural areas is very heavy, and machine power is very much needed. Therefore, I suggest that relevant factories should not only produce machines but also manufacture parts for supply to meet the needs of all parties.

    农村需要煤气机零件
    我们乡里的渔古农业社和大槐树农业社有两部煤气机的“火塞环”坏了，不能发动，派人到洛阳、郑州买都没有买到。后来就不远千里坐火车到天津煤气机制造厂去请求协助，可是这个厂也不能供给这种零件。结果这两部煤气机就因为配不上零件而不能使用。目前农村的排灌任务很紧张，很需要机器动力，因此，我建议有关工厂既要出产机器也要制造零件供应，以满足各方面的需要。
