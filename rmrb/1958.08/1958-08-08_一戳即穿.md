	Pierced With a Single Poke

	The British Foreign Office spokesman stated on the 6th that Britain "would not approve of holding a United Nations General Assembly meeting to discuss the Anglo-American aggression in Jordan and Lebanon." What is the reason? This spokesman shamelessly argued that "because there is no such aggression at all."

	This kind of "a guilty person gives himself away" tactic is naturally pierced with a single poke. May we ask, if there really "is no such aggression," then why are the United States and Britain afraid to bring this issue to the United Nations General Assembly for open discussion?

	The British Foreign Office spokesman's eagerness to oppose the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East is like a criminal not wanting to be sentenced, which precisely demonstrates the guilty conscience of the aggressors.

	A passage from the "New York Times" on the 5th can serve as a commentary for the British Foreign Office spokesman. This mouthpiece of the American monopoly group admitted that if the UN General Assembly discussed the Soviet proposal for the US and British troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, "the huge Arab-Asian-African group, possibly plus some Latin American member states who remember the history of the US Marines' intervention, may become a strong pillar for the Russians."

	It is clear that fearing the judgment of justice and worrying about being publicly condemned once again are the real reasons why the US and British aggressors are trying their best to avoid the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East. Of course, the United States and Britain have already taken the defendant's seat as aggressors, and they cannot avoid it even if they want to.

    一戳即穿
    英国外交部发言人6日表示，英国“将不赞成举行联合国大会会议来讨论英美在约旦和黎巴嫩的侵略”，理由何在呢？这个发言人居然厚着脸皮强辩说：“因为根本不存在这样的侵略”。
    这种此地无银三百两的手法，自然是一戳即穿的。试问，如果真的“不存在这样的侵略”的话，那末美英为什么害怕把这个问题拿到联合国大会公开讨论呢？
    英国外交部发言人急于表示反对联大讨论美英侵略中东问题，是犯了罪而不想被判处，这恰恰说明了侵略者的作贼心虚。
    5日“纽约时报”的一段话，正好可以作为英国外交部发言人的旁白。这家美国垄断集团的喉舌承认，联大如果讨论苏联要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的建议，“巨大的阿拉伯亚非集团，可能再加上一些记得美国海军陆战队进行干涉的历史的拉丁美洲成员国，可能成为俄国人的强大支柱”。
    由此可见，害怕正义的裁判，担心再一次遭到公开的谴责，就是美英侵略者极力回避联大讨论美英对中东侵略的真正原因。当然，美英已经坐上了侵略者的被告席，想回避也是办不到的。
