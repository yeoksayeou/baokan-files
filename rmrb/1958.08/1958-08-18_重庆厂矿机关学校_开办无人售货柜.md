Chongqing Factories, Mines, Government Offices, and Schools
　　Open Unmanned Sales Counters
　　Upon entering the store,
　　A brand-new scene unfolds;
　　Goods are complete,
　　Clerks unseen;
　　Unattended,
　　Yet orderly;
　　Self-select and buy,
　　Pay on your own;
　　What is the reason?
　　A manifestation of the communist spirit.
This is a poem by the people of Chongqing praising the unmanned sales counters. Recently, state-owned commercial departments in Chongqing have established more than 200 unmanned sales counters in factories, mines, government offices, hospitals, and schools. These counters have no salespersons; buyers take the goods and pay on their own. Every one or two days, state-owned store clerks make rounds to each counter to collect the money from the collection box and replenish the goods.

The goods sold at these unmanned counters range from a dozen to over ninety varieties. Generally, the unmanned counters sell items such as towels, toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, cigarettes, matches, household medicines, tea, and candy. There are also special counters set up to cater to different consumer groups: for example, counters selling women's sanitary products in factories with female workers; a counter selling liquor and snacks at the Sujiaba Petroleum Company workshop to facilitate workers having a drink after work to relieve fatigue; most counters set up in schools sell stationery items such as envelopes, writing paper, exercise books, and ink. Many counters also have purchase registration forms available. Customers can fill out a form indicating what they need and drop it into the collection box, and the required items will be available for purchase at the counter the next day. Liu Yixin, a guest staying at the Xuetianwan Guesthouse, filled out a purchase form for a bath towel and bought a satisfactory one at the unmanned counter the next day.

The first question that comes to people’s minds is whether implementing unmanned sales will lead to loss of goods or errors. The reporter specifically visited commercial departments, factories, and government offices and did not find any instances of lost goods, and errors were minimal. In a survey of 77 units, relevant departments found only three units had experienced slight errors. A counter set up by the Tongyuanju Trading Store in a collective unit was missing candy worth 7 jiao. It was speculated that a child who did not understand had taken it, but during a stocktaking, candy worth exactly 7 jiao was found to be in excess. It turned out that a careless salesperson had under-weighed the candy by 7 jiao when delivering it to the counter. On one occasion, a counter set up at the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory was short of 4 jiao 3 fen worth of goods. The salesperson could not find the reason for the loss, but a few days later, the counter's collection box contained an extra 4 jiao 3 fen in cash. An unknown customer had taken the goods first and then paid later. Since the implementation of unmanned sales counters, salespersons have frequently found that customers who forgot to bring change would take the goods first, write an IOU, and immediately pay the amount the next day.

Various government offices, factories, and schools welcome the establishment of these counters by state-owned stores. Many units find suitable locations and furniture for the stores and take great care to protect the goods from rain and sun.

Now, "unmanned sales" is being piloted on major streets. The Lianglukou Department Store's unmanned sales hall officially opened on the 9th, selling more than 1,600 varieties of goods. In the 400-square-meter hall, there were only a few service personnel to exchange change for customers and introduce goods to elderly customers. On the first day, the number of customers doubled compared to normal; a total of 277 yuan and 6 jiao 6 fen worth of goods were sold, and 277 yuan and 5 jiao 2 fen in cash were collected, with a difference of only 1 jiao 4 fen.

### 重庆厂矿机关学校  开办无人售货柜

    重庆厂矿机关学校
    开办无人售货柜
    一进商店，
    气象万千；
    货物齐全，
    店员不见；
    无人照管，
    有条不乱；
    自挑自购，
    自己付钱；
    是啥道理？
    共产主义风格的表现。
    这是重庆人民歌颂无人售货专柜的诗句。重庆国营商业部门最近在厂矿、机关、医院、学校里设立了二百多个无人售货专柜。这种专柜没有售货员照看，买主自取货，自付款。每隔一、二天国营商店售货员巡回到各专柜收款箱收回货款、补充货物。
    这种无人售货专柜出售的商品从十多个品种到九十多个花色品种。一般的无人售货专柜，出卖的商品是毛巾、牙膏、牙刷、香皂、香烟、火柴、家庭日常用药、茶叶、糖果等。也有为不同消费对象服务而设置的特殊专柜：如在有女工的工厂设立妇女卫生用品的专柜；苏家坝石油公司工场里设立出售酒和下酒小菜的专柜，便利工人下班后吃点酒，容易消除疲劳；设在学校里的多数专柜是出售信封、信笺、练习本、墨水等文具用品。许多专柜旁还备有购货登记单，顾主需要什么，填张购货单投到收款箱内，第二天就能在专柜上买到需要的用品。住在学田湾招待所的客人刘怡薪，填了需要一条浴巾的购货单，第二天他在无人专柜上买回了合意的浴巾。
    实行无人售货会不会丢失商品，发生差错，这是人们首先会想到的问题。记者特地走访了商业部门、工厂、机关，没有访问到丢失商品的事例，差错也极微小。有关单位在七十七个单位中调查只有三个单位发生过轻微的一点差错。铜元局贸易商店设在集体单位的一个专柜曾少了价值七角的糖果，有人推测是不懂事的孩子拿跑的，不久在盘点库存时，又恰巧多了七角钱的糖果，原来是粗心的售货员在给专柜送糖果时少称了七角钱糖果。有一次，设在西南制药厂的专柜少了四角三分钱的货物，售货员找不出丢失的原因，不几天，这个专柜的收款箱里多出了四角三分现款，这是一个不知名的顾客先拿了货品，随后才补付了货款。实行无人售货专柜以来，售货员们不时发现顾客因一时忘记带零钱，先拿了货，写了欠条，第二天马上把款补上的事。
    各个机关、厂矿、学校单位都欢迎国营商店设立这种专柜，许多单位为商店找适中地点、家具，他们还为商品防雨防晒，十分爱护商品。
    现在“无人售货”已在主要街道上试点。9日两路口百货商店无人售货营业厅正式营业，出售的商品达一千六百多个花色、品种，在四百多平方公尺的大厅里只有几个服务员给顾主调换零钱，向老年顾客介绍商品。第一天顾客比平时增加一倍；共售出商品二百七十七元六角六分，收回现金二百七十七元五角二分，差额只有一角四分。
