　　“Your Crime is That I Want to Eat You”
　　Wang Ziye
    The US and Britain sent troops to Lebanon and Jordan, claiming that it was to help these two countries "maintain independence" and prevent "indirect aggression."
    Mentioning "indirect aggression" naturally brings to mind that ancient fable:
    A lamb went to a stream to drink, and unfortunately encountered a hungry wolf. The wolf naturally drooled when he saw the lamb, eager to swallow it in one gulp. But things should always be done neatly, and a pretext must be found before taking action. The wolf shouted, "Shameless fellow, how dare you muddy my clear water? I'm going to knock your head off." The lamb replied, "Great King Wolf, please calm your anger. Can't you see that I'm drinking water a hundred steps downstream from you? How could I muddy your clear water?" The wolf then said, "No matter what, you offended me here in the summer of the year before last, and I won't forget that." The lamb replied, "Please forgive me, Great King. I was only born last year and am not even a year old yet. How could I have offended you the year before last?" The wolf said again, "Then it must be your brother." The lamb said, "I don't have a brother." The wolf said, "Then it must be your relatives, your dogs and shepherds, they all want to harm me. I'm going to settle accounts with you for all their sins." The lamb said, "What does their business have to do with me?" After much back and forth, the wolf was at a loss for words. Finally, it had to tear off its mask, open its bloody mouth, and say, "Shut up, who has time to argue with you, you little beast, your crime is that I want to eat you." With that, it devoured the lamb.
    The so-called "indirect aggression" is just "your crime is that I want to eat you." The US and British imperialists sending troops to invade the Middle East is just this kind of thing.
    Some people may think this way: The term "indirect aggression" is too broad. If you push it, what can't it be used for? Not only can the Lebanese civil war and the Iraqi revolution be used, but even the American economic crisis, Nixon getting beaten up during his visit to Latin America, Dulles' poor appetite, and Eisenhower's cold and cough are all threatened by "indirect aggression." However, when the imperialists openly shout: "Your crime is that I want to eat you," the wolf's true face is revealed. It looks fierce on the outside, but is extremely empty inside, proving that all the weapons they can use are exhausted. If they had other weapons to use, why would they use this clumsy broken thing?
    All aggressors, all imperialists are wolves, but now standing opposite them is by no means a lamb that can be manipulated at will, but the incomparably powerful people of the whole world. If the imperialists cannot see this, they are bound to make a historical mistake. This fable should now be rewritten, not with the lamb being eaten by the wolf, but with the wolf being defeated by the lamb.

### “你的罪名就是我要吃”

　　“你的罪名就是我要吃”
　　王子野
    美英出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，口口声声说是为了帮助这两个国家“维持独立”和防止“间接侵略”。
    提到“间接侵略”之类很自然就会想到那篇古老的寓言：
    一只小羊走向小河去喝水，不巧遇着一只饿狼。狼见了小羊自然馋涎欲滴，恨不得一口吞下去。但是事情总该做得漂亮一点，要想出口实来才好下手。狼喝道：“无耻的家伙，你怎敢搅浑我的清水？我要打掉你的脑袋。”羊答道：“狼大王请息怒，你不是看见吗，我喝水的地点是离你一百步之外的下游，怎会搅浑你的清水呢？”狼又说：“不管怎样，你前年夏天在这里得罪过我，这个我不会忘掉的。”羊答道：“请大王原谅，我只是去年才出生，现在还不到一岁，怎能在前年就得罪于你呢？”狼又说：“那一定是你的哥哥。”羊说：“我是没有哥哥的。”狼说：“那么一定是你的亲属，是你们的狗和牧人，他们都想来害我，为了他们的一切罪过，我要和你算账。”羊说：“他们的事同我又有什么关系呢？”说来说去，狼都理亏了，最后它不得不撕破脸皮，张开血口说：“住嘴，谁有功夫和你辩论，小畜生，你的罪名就是我要吃。”说完就把羊吃掉。
    所谓“间接侵略”者就是“你的罪名就是我要吃”。美英帝国主义出兵侵略中东不过是这么一回事。
    有的人也许这样想：“间接侵略”这个词太宽泛了，推开了去用，什么事情用不上去？不仅黎巴嫩内战，伊拉克革命可以用，而且连美国的经济危机，尼克松访问拉丁美洲挨揍，杜勒斯食欲不佳，艾森豪威尔伤风咳嗽也都莫不是受了“间接侵略”的威胁。然而当帝国主义者已经公然叫喊：“你的罪名就是我要吃”的时候，狼相也就毕露，外表似乎很凶，其实内部空虚之至，证明能用的武器都已光了。倘若他们还有其它武器可用，何至使用起这副笨拙的破家伙？
    一切侵略者，一切帝国主义都是狼，可是如今站在他们对面的却决不是可以任意摆布的小羊，而是比他们强大无比的全世界人民。帝国主义者倘若看不到这一点，就必定要犯历史性的错误。这篇寓言现在应当重新改写过，不是小羊被狼吃掉，而是狼被小羊打倒。
