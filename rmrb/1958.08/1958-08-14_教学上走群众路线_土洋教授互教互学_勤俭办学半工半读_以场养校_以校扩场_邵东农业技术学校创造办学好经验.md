Implementing the Mass Line in Teaching; Indigenous and Foreign Professors Teach and Learn From Each Other; Running Schools Diligently and Frugally Through Part-Work and Part-Study
Using Farms to Support Schools; Expanding Farms Through Schools
Shaodong Agricultural Technical School Creates Good Experiences in Running Schools

(By our correspondent) This newspaper reports that in March of this year, Shaodong County, Hunan Province, adopted the method of "using farms to support schools, expanding farms through schools, and combining farm management with schooling." It set up an agricultural technical school within the Dongjiawan County Farm, accumulating many good experiences in running schools.

The school is headed by Li Qun, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, as Principal, and Zeng Deqin, Director of the County Farm, as Vice-Principal. According to the needs of agricultural production in the county, the school has three specialties: grain production, economic crops, animal husbandry, and aquaculture, with a total of five classes. There are 241 male and female students and twelve teachers. Among the teachers, five are students from the county's intermediate agricultural technical school transferred from the County Agricultural Bureau, considered to have "formal training." The rest are all workers from the farm who are breeders, grafters, rice growers, and watermelon growers, who should be considered to have "military backgrounds." The students call the teachers with "formal training" "foreign professors" and the teachers with "military backgrounds" "indigenous professors." Lectures combine "foreign" and "indigenous" knowledge, combining classroom teaching with field practice. In the past four months, students have learned very well in terms of culture and technology. The results of the mid-term test showed that among the 241 students, 40% achieved an average score of 80 or above, and only 1.2% failed. They can generally speak and do what they have learned in their specialties.

Most of these students have a higher elementary school graduation level and have generally participated in production labor in rural areas for more than a year. Therefore, they are not only highly motivated to learn but also have good labor habits. To date, they have generally earned more than 400 work points each. The entire production tasks of the farm, including fifty-five mu of rice paddies, two hundred and fifteen mu of dry land, thirty-seven mu of orchards, seventy mu of fruit seedlings, forty-one dairy cows, fifty pigs, and eighty boxes of bees, are all contracted by the students and managed very well. The early rice yield has doubled compared to last year, and the orchard and dry land crops are also expected to have a good harvest.

The basic experience of Shaodong County in running agricultural technical schools is, first of all, to put politics in command, mobilize the masses, and solve the difficulties encountered in teaching. In the first two months after the school started, students often encountered difficult problems in production practice that could not be found in books, and teachers could not solve them either, which affected the progress of teaching. Once, students in the economic crop class had a disagreement on the ventilation and feed issues in the silkworm rearing room during silkworm rearing practice. The school's Party branch and teachers jointly studied the issue and decided to hand it over to the students for discussion and find answers from the debate. So, they held a classroom discussion meeting, and after a debate, the opinions converged, and the problem was solved. They gradually developed an advanced teaching method of "classroom teaching, production practice, classroom discussion, and summary improvement," which follows the mass line. Due to the adoption of this teaching method, the quality of teaching has been improved. For example, when the economic crop class studied budding, in seven days of practice, each person budded more than 50 plants per hour, with a survival rate of over 83%, catching up with the level of general technicians. Teachers generally reported that if the old teaching methods were followed, they would not be able to achieve this level even after three years of study.

Secondly, the combination of foreign and indigenous teaching, mutual cooperation, and learning from each other's strengths has a very good effect. It not only overcomes the old teaching methods of teachers teaching according to textbooks and being divorced from reality, and closely combines theoretical knowledge with practical knowledge, but also is a new form of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants. Currently, the school has three forms of combining foreign and indigenous teaching: 1. Joint lesson preparation, mutually enriching teaching content. 2. Collaboration in classroom teaching, with indigenous professors performing technical operations for foreign professors, and foreign professors drawing and organizing lecture outlines for indigenous professors. 3. Jointly guiding production practice and summarizing experience.

Thirdly, the school's implementation of the policy of "running schools diligently and frugally, and part-work and part-study" is also very good. Generally, students can achieve self-sufficiency in production. Parents are very satisfied.

The Shaodong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized the school's experience in running schools and decided to double its size after this autumn, developing it to 500 people.

　　邵东农业技术学校创造办学好经验
    本报讯　今年3月，湖南省邵东县采取“以场养校、以校扩场、办场与办学相结合”的办法，在董家湾县农场内办起一所农业技术学校，积累了很多办学的好经验。
    这所学校由县委副书记李群任校长，县农场场长曾德勤任副校长。学校根据全县农业生产的需要，设粮食生产、经济作物、畜牧、水产等三个专业，共五个班。有男女学生二百四十一人，教师十二名。教师中除了五名是由县农业局调去的中级农业技术学校的学生，够得上“科班出身”外，其余都是农场里的饲养员、嫁接员、种水稻的和种西瓜的工人，都应该算“行伍出身”。同学们把“科班出身”的老师叫“洋教授”，把“行伍出身”的老师，叫“土教授”，讲课是“洋”“土”结合，课堂教学和田间实习相结合。四个月来，学生在文化、技术方面都学的很好。期中测验的结果，二百四十一名学生中，平均成绩在八十分以上的占40％，不及格的只占1.2％。对于学过的专业，一般都能说能做。
    这批学生大都具有高小毕业程度，一般在农村参加过一年以上的生产劳动，因此他们不仅学习热情高，而且有很好的劳动习惯。到目前止，一般都做了四百多个劳动工分。农场的全部生产任务，包括五十五亩水稻、二百一十五亩旱土、三十七亩果园、七十亩果苗、四十一头乳牛、五十头猪、八十箱蜜蜂都由学生包起来，经营管理得很好。早稻比去年增产两倍，果园、旱土作物也可望丰收。
    邵东县开办农业技术学校的基本经验，首先是政治挂帅，发动群众，来解决教学上所碰到的困难。在开学后的头两个月，学生在生产实习中常常碰到书本上找不到答案的难题，老师们也无法解决，影响教学进度。有一次，经济作物班的学生在养蚕实习中，对于养蚕室的通风换气问题、饲料问题，发生争执，意见分歧。学校党支部和教师共同进行研究，决定把问题交给学生去讨论，从辩论中找寻答案。于是开了一次课堂讨论会，一场辩论后，意见趋于一致，问题也解决了。他们在教学上逐步摸索出“课堂教学、生产实习、课堂讨论、总结提高”这样一种走群众路线的先进教学方法。由于采取这种教学方法，提高了教学质量。例如，经济作物班学习芽接时，七天实习中，每人每小时芽接五十多株，成活率在83％以上，赶上一般技工水平。老师们普遍反映：如果按老一套的教学方法，学三年也达不到这样的程度。
    其次，洋土结合教学，互相协作，取长补短，效果很好。不仅克服了过去教师照本宣科、脱离实际的教学方法，使理论知识与实践知识紧密结合起来，而且是知识分子与工农分子相结合的一种新形式。目前，这个学校洋土教学结合的形式有三种：一、共同备课，相互充实教学内容。二、课堂教学上的协作，土教授为洋教授作技术操作表演，洋教授为土教授绘图、整理讲课提纲。三、在生产实习上，共同进行指导，总结经验。
    第三，这个学校贯彻“勤俭办学、勤工俭学”的方针也很好。一般学生都能做到生产自给。家长们很满意。
    中共邵东县委最近总结了这个学校的办学经验，决定在今年秋后扩大一倍，发展到五百人。
