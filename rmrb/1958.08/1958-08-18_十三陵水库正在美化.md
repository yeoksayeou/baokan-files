Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Since the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir began storing water on July 11th, it has accumulated 15.7 million cubic meters, with an average water depth of 14 meters in the storage area.

Currently, the reservoir's ancillary facilities are under intense construction and preparation. The seven-arch bridge across the reservoir connecting Dahongmen and Changling Road has already had its bridge piers built. A 26-meter-long and 7-meter-wide reinforced concrete bridge is under construction to connect the west side of the dam across the spillway to the West Ring Lake Road. Two new socialist villages, the Fairy Cave on the West Ring Lake Road and the site of the former Imperial Palace on the East Ring Lake Road, are being built facing each other from afar.

To commemorate the achievements of the more than 400,000 laborers who built the reservoir, the foundation excavation for the monument being built at the east end of the dam has begun. The four sides of this monument will be carved with inscriptions by Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De in white marble. On the base of the monument, Guo Moruo's memorial text summarizing the construction of the reservoir will be inscribed. A statue of workers, peasants, and soldiers will be placed on top of the monument. At the same time, at the east end of the dam, at the location where Chairman Mao wrote "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir" when he worked at the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir construction site, a reservoir construction cultural relics exhibition room will be built.

　　十三陵水库正在美化
    据新华社17日讯　十三陵水库从7月11日蓄水以来，已蓄水一千五百七十万立方公尺，蓄水面积内平均水深十四公尺。
    目前，水库的附属设施正在紧张施工和进行施工准备。跨越水库沟通大红门和长陵路的七孔长桥，桥墩已经筑好。从大坝西端跨过溢洪道连接西环湖路，正在建设一座二十六公尺长、七公尺宽的钢筋混凝土桥。在西环湖路仙人洞和东环湖路行宫旧址的两座遥遥相对的社会主义新村正在建设中。
    为纪念四十多万劳动者兴建水库的功绩，大坝东头建设的纪念碑已开挖基础土方。这座纪念碑，四面将用汉白玉雕刻上毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来和朱德同志的题字。在碑座上，将刻上郭沫若撰写的概述水库建设经过的纪念文。碑顶将装上一幅工农兵的雕像。同时，在大坝东头，毛主席到十三陵水库工地劳动时题写“十三陵水库”的房址处，将兴建一座水库建设文物展览室。
