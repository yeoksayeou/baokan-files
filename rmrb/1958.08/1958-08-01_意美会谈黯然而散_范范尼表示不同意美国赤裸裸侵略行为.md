Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 31st: Italian Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani concluded two days of talks with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles on July 30th. The empty content of the communique issued after the talks reveals that the United States' desire for Italy to more actively support its armed aggression in the Middle East was not achieved, and Italy's hope to get a share of the economic aggression in the Middle East from the United States also failed.

The communique stated that the two sides "studied the current world situation, including the situation in the Middle East and the question of a possible summit conference within the framework of the United Nations." The talks found that the views of both sides "were satisfactorily consistent." However, in a speech at the National Press Club on July 30th, Fanfani emphasized Italy's plan to control the Middle East region by starting with the economy, and disagreed with America's current naked armed aggression. He demanded that the "economic and social needs of the Near and Middle East not be underestimated."

On the issue of a summit conference, Fanfani agreed with the United States' proposal to hold a summit conference within the framework of the United Nations to discuss the Middle East issue, while also believing that this did not exclude "informal discussions" between Western leaders and Soviet leaders.

The communique did not mention the economic plan for the Middle East region, which Fanfani repeatedly emphasized, but only stated that "Italy's attitude towards its interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East is important," and that "ways to ensure that Italy's views are taken into account on a lasting basis are also important. They have arranged to maintain close contact."

Sources say that Fanfani emphasized a so-called "Euro-American aid" plan for Middle Eastern countries during the talks, and stated that Italy was willing to use its "favorable" position in the Middle East to make a "contribution" to any such plan. However, sources say that Eisenhower and Dulles did not "undertake any obligations" in this regard, and only believed that "research" might be conducted among senior leaders of the State Department in the future.

    意美会谈黯然而散
    范范尼表示不同意美国赤裸裸侵略行为
    新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：意大利总理范范尼同美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯30日结束了历时两天的会谈。从会谈结束后发表的内容空洞的公报可以看出，美国想要意大利更积极地支持它武装侵略中东的愿望没有能够实现，而意大利想在对中东地区的经济侵略中从美国那里分一杯羹的希望也落了空。
    公报说，双方在会谈中“研究了目前的世界形势，包括中东形势和围绕着在联合国范围内可能举行的政府首脑会议的问题”，会谈中发现双方的看法“是令人满意的一致的”。但是，范范尼30日在全国新闻俱乐部发表的演说中，强调指出意大利的主张从经济着手来控制中东地区的计划，而不同意美国目前赤裸裸的武装侵略行为。他要求“不要低估中近东的经济和社会需要”。
    在最高级会议问题上，范范尼一方面表示同意美国在联合国范围内举行讨论中东问题的最高级会议的主张，同时又认为这并不排除西方领袖和苏联领导人之间的“非正式讨论”。
    公报中没有提到范范尼再三强调的关于中东地区的经济计划，而只是说，“意大利对于它在地中海和中东的利益的态度是重要的”，“保证在持久的基础上使得意大利的意见得到考虑的办法也是重要的。他们已安排好保持紧密的联系”。
    有消息说，范范尼在会谈中强调对中东国家实行一个所谓“欧—美援助”计划。并且表示意大利愿意利用它在中东的“有利”地位对任何这种计划作出“贡献”。但是，消息说，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在这方面都没有“承担任何义务”，他们只是认为以后可能在国务院高级领导人中间进行“研究”。
