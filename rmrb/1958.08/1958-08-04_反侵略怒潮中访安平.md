    Visiting Anping Amidst the Tide of Anti-Aggression Fury
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhu Zemin
    Anping Township, Xianghe County, Hebei Province, is a very ordinary village. But twelve years ago, the "Anping Incident," an American military invasion of the liberated areas, which shocked the world, occurred here.
    According to the records of the liberated area newspapers at the time, this incident was as follows: "On the morning of July 29, 1946, more than 60 members of the U.S. Marine Corps patrol stationed in Tianjin, along with more than 80 Chiang troops, in 24 vehicles, invaded the Eighth Route Army in Anping Town, Xianghe County, Jidong Liberated Area. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and after several hours of fierce fighting, our army suffered 13 casualties, killing and wounding 14 American soldiers, and the Chiang army also suffered casualties. In the afternoon, more than 300 American soldiers, with the cooperation of aircraft, rushed to reinforce from Tianjin. In order to avoid escalating the situation, the Eighth Route Army painfully withdrew."
    In order to learn the details of this incident, I interviewed Dong Yucheng, a guerrilla fighter who fought against the American invading army at the time, in Xianghe County. When American soldiers were mentioned, a faint smile of contempt crossed Dong Yucheng's face. He said, "Twelve years ago, I dealt with American soldiers, and they were really pushovers, paper tigers!" Then, he recounted what happened back then.
    In 1946, Dong Yucheng was only sixteen years old. He joined the guerrilla team in January and encountered American soldiers in July.
    Dong Yucheng said that in that battle, the American soldiers used carbines, machine guns, and artillery, while we used some broken guns and grenades, but we still taught the American aggressors a lesson. After the shooting started, the American soldiers were so scared that they ran around everywhere, some hiding in the cornfields, some shivering in the cars, and some lying on the ground, afraid to raise their heads. In this battle, we sent several American devils to hell and also captured machine guns, carbines, and a lot of ammunition.
    The American paper tiger was exposed, and the "young masters" suffered a loss, so they sent planes to bomb Anping Township, causing walls to collapse, thick smoke to rise, and a dozen innocent civilians were killed. The bombs scorched the green crops and corn in the fields. This is the heinous crime committed by the American aggressors in the "Anping Incident" twelve years ago!
    This blood debt has been in the hearts of the Anping people for twelve years. When they heard that the United States was invading the Middle East again and wanted to launch a war, old and new hatreds flooded their hearts, arousing unparalleled anger. More than 5,000 people from 28 villages in Anping Township held a protest rally and demonstration on July 26, unanimously pointing out: "We must not allow the atrocities committed by the American invading army in Anping twelve years ago to be repeated in the Middle East!" Han Ming's younger brother, Han Min, was killed by American planes twelve years ago, with seventy wounds all over his body. Han Ming said angrily: "I have remembered this blood debt for twelve years. Now we are living a good life, and we have straightened our backs. I cannot watch the people of the Middle East suffer from American imperialism again." On the twelfth anniversary of the "Anping Incident" – the morning of July 29 – more than 600 militiamen in Anping Township held another protest rally, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the people of the Middle East. Dong Yucheng said well: "Who can the American paper tiger scare? Twelve years ago, we used broken guns and grenades to defeat them. Today, we are even stronger, and the American 'young master soldiers' are no match. If they do not withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East and insist on launching a war of aggression, they will be digging their own graves!"
    "Take practical actions to strengthen the forces for defending peace!" This is the fighting slogan put forward by the people of Anping. Originally, the township planned to guarantee a grain yield of 600 jin per mu this year and strive for 800 jin, but now it has been changed to guarantee 800 jin and strive to achieve a 1,000-jin township. The yield of seed cotton per mu has also been increased from 300 jin to 800 jin, and they also want to strive for 1,000 jin. More than 140 members of the agricultural cooperatives in various villages rushed to plant sweet potatoes in the rain after returning from the demonstration on the 26th, planting 18 mu in one day. They also proposed to fight hard for five days and nights, planting more than 12,000 mu before "August 1st." After holding a protest rally on the 29th, all of the township's 600 militiamen wrote pledges and guarantees, promising to plant 200 sweet potato seedlings, accumulate 80,000 jin of fertilizer, and plant 50 trees per person. Before "August 1st," all the militiamen will also build 23 pig farms.
    Anping, this ordinary village, is boiling everywhere, and the unanimous slogan of the people is: "Planting one more sweet potato, accumulating one more jin of fertilizer, means adding one more point to the force for defending peace!"

### 反侵略怒潮中访安平

    反侵略怒潮中访安平
    新华社记者　朱泽民
    河北省香河县安平乡，是一个很普通的村庄。可是在十二年前，这里曾经发生过轰动世界的美军侵犯解放区的“安平事件”。
    根据当时解放区报刊的记载，这一事件是这样的：“1946年7月29日上午，驻天津的美海军陆战队巡逻队六十多人，配合蒋军八十多人，乘汽车二十四辆，向冀东解放区香河县安平镇的八路军进犯。八路军被迫自卫，激战数小时，是役我军伤亡十三人，打死打伤美军十四人，蒋军也有伤亡。下午，美军三百多人在飞机配合下，自天津赶来增援，八路军为避免事态扩大，乃忍痛撤退。”
    为了知道这一事件的详细情况，在香河县城我访问了当时同美国侵略军作战的游击队员董玉成。一提起美国兵，在董玉成的脸上就掠过一丝轻蔑的微笑。他说：“十二年前我就跟美国兵打过交道，那真叫脓包蛋、纸老虎！”接着，他滔滔不绝地叙述起当年发生的事情。
    1946年董玉成才十六岁，1月里参加游击队，7月里就碰上了美国兵。
    董玉成说，那次战斗，美国兵用的是卡宾枪、机枪和炮，我们用的是一些破枪和手榴弹，但还是把美国侵略者教训了一顿。枪打响以后，美国兵吓得到处乱窜，有的躲到玉米地里，有的爬在汽车里打哆嗦，有的卧在地上不敢抬头。这一仗我们把好几个美国鬼子送给了阎王，还缴获了机关枪、卡宾枪和许多子弹。
    美国纸老虎被戳破了，“少爷兵”吃了亏，就派来了飞机，在安平乡大肆轰炸，一时墙倒屋塌，浓烟四起，十几个无辜的老百姓被炸死，炸弹把地里碧绿的谷子和玉米都烧焦了。这就是美国侵略者十二年前在“安平事件”中犯下的滔天罪行！
    这笔血海深仇，记在安平人民心里已经有十二年了。当他们听到美国又侵略中东、又想发动战争的时候，旧恨新仇一齐涌上心头，激起了人们无比的愤怒。安平乡二十八个村的五千多人在7月26日举行了抗议集会和示威游行，人们一致指出：“决不能让十二年前美国侵略军在安平犯下的暴行在中东重演！”农业社员韩明的弟弟韩敏在十二年前被美国飞机炸死，全身有七十处伤痕。韩明愤恨地说：“这笔血债我记了十二年，现在我们过好日子了，腰板也挺起来了，我不能看着中东人民再受美帝的侵害。”在“安平事件”十二周年纪念日——7月29日上午，安平乡的六百多名民兵又举行了抗议集会，坚决支持中东人民的正义斗争。董玉成说得好：“美国纸老虎能吓唬谁？十二年前我们用破枪手榴弹就打得它落花流水，今天我们更强大了，美国‘少爷兵’更不在话下，如果它不把侵略军撤出中东，坚持发动侵略战争，那就是自掘坟墓！”
    “用实际行动，增强保卫和平的力量！”这是安平人民提出的战斗口号。原来全乡计划今年保证亩产粮食六百斤，争取八百斤，现在改成保证八百斤，争取实现千斤乡；亩产籽棉也从三百斤提高到八百斤，还要争取一千斤。各庄农业社一百四十多名社员在26日示威游行回来，就冒着雨突击栽白薯，一天栽了十八亩，他们又提出苦战五昼夜，“八一”前栽完一万二千多亩。全乡六百多名民兵在29日举行抗议集会以后，每个人都写了决心书和保证书，他们保证每人栽薯二百棵，积肥八万斤，植树五十棵，“八一”前全体民兵还要建起二十三座养猪场。
    安平这个普通的乡村到处在沸腾着，人们一致的口号是：“多栽一棵薯、多积一斤肥，就是增添一分保卫和平的力量！”
