    Scenery and Graveyard
    Kang Tuo
    During the recent days of imperialist aggression against Middle Eastern countries by the US and Britain, I was living amidst the beautiful scenery of the communist sprouts vigorously growing in the countryside.
    China is rushing forward at a space-flight speed. Not long ago, people in the countryside in their fifties were still worried that they would not see the beautiful days of communism; now, old people in their eighties and nineties are all smiling and firmly believe that they will enjoy the happiness of communism. Some old men even stubbornly believe that they are already living in communism. Xie Guozhen's old man in Dasigezhuang, Xushui County, is already eighty-seven years old. The other night, when the village power station started sending electricity, he sat alone in the brightly lit street until late at night and refused to sleep; his old lady came back from the fields after working the night shift, and urged him home in surprise, but he said, "You can go to sleep first if you want, I still want to taste the flavor of communism!"
    Of course, generating electricity is not communism. But what the eighty-seven-year-old man said does have another point. Like all agricultural cooperatives in Xushui County, Dasigezhuang established canteens long ago, including one that gives preferential treatment to young children and the elderly. Kindergartens were also established long ago, and no longer allow households to support their own children, but are uniformly supplied by the whole cooperative. More importantly, Dasigezhuang, like all other places in the county, eliminated private plots of land for members and flattened the grave mounds long ago. All pigs are raised by the cooperative. Dilapidated houses and stoves have all been demolished, the adobe has been put on the fields, and good bricks are being prepared to build new buildings; those buildings will be distributed according to the number of people in each household, and not according to the number of old houses originally owned by each household. Supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives have become part of the agricultural cooperative, and these aspects of work are gradually shortening the distance between urban and rural areas as the county's market fairs are being abolished. The agricultural cooperative also has more than a dozen machines, factories for grain processing and locally produced fertilizers, and sewing and barbering services. After the overall leveling of the land, the management of farmland has been professionalized like a factory, with specialized teams. The crops in the cooperative are growing extraordinarily luxuriantly. The club will soon have everything from slide projectors and broadcasting to calligraphy, painting, musical instruments, chess, and other entertainment. In a word, communist sprouts have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in Dasigezhuang and Xushui, and the People's Commune system, full of communism, has begun to be realized concretely and gradually here. A year ago, even just a few months ago, who would have thought that such a beautiful ideal would begin to become a reality in such a short period of time? The Party's General Line and the great and infinite creativity of the Chinese people are making our lives not only equal to twenty years in a day, but even to two hundred or two thousand years in a day.
    I do not intend to describe more of the other beautiful scenery of Dasigezhuang. I just cannot help but mention here again the time when electricity began to be used there. That was the first power station in the rural areas of Xushui. On the night of July 18, the county held a ten-thousand-person rally there to celebrate the completion of the power station. The suddenly bright lights that had just started to send electricity instantly illuminated the hearts of more than 300,000 people in the county through the conference, making them hot and transparent. What a thrilling, joyful, and fascinating conference that was! However, that jubilant conference later suddenly and reasonably turned into a roaring ocean. Ten thousand people raised their arms and shouted against the US and British imperialist aggression against the Middle East, determined to fully support the struggle of the Arab brothers; the boundless indignation in the venue directly crossed the electric light network and rushed to the ninth heaven. And the issue was not only the sound and momentum, but also the fact that people were inspired by the electrified scenery and excited by the pirate behavior of imperialism, and immediately strengthened their practical actions. People immediately found ways to tap potential. The Dasigezhuang Agricultural Cooperative took the lead, raising their target for this year's grain yield per mu from 10,000 jin to 15,000 jin; in addition, a "10,000 jin per mu township" appeared. Everyone guaranteed to take higher yields as satellites to heaven, and large areas of high yields as marshals ascending the tent, in order to surpass the UK and the US in production more quickly and to support the Arab people. Here, the behavior of piracy and the electrification of the Chinese countryside are a clear black and white contrast. The bright electric lights ignited everyone's burning enthusiasm from the front, while the black crimes of the pirates agitated the people from the reverse, making them swell with greater energy.
    And the increase in people's enthusiasm is by no means limited to the venue of Dasigezhuang. Now, there are more than tens of millions of cities and villages in the world that are in the midst of the Great Leap Forward construction like Dasigezhuang! There are even more than hundreds of millions of people who have broken free and are breaking free from colonial chains, as well as people in capitalist countries who are fighting for peace and democracy! All these hundreds of millions of people are now protesting against the crimes of the US and British pirates and supporting their Arab brothers with the roaring force of the ocean and more active practical actions. The people's camp has many people, great enthusiasm, justice in their hands, and the best weapons, just like the morning sun; imperialism has no position that can stand. These pirates are already setting in the west, and their frenzied aggression is nothing more than a reflected afterglow. The fact that the Iraqi dynasty, which imperialism painstakingly nurtured, was overthrown by the people in just two hours shows that the pirates have embarked on the track of collapsing at a speed of twenty or two hundred years a day. The future of imperialism is nothing more than that wherever it invades, a graveyard will be there. Moreover, from the scene in the Chinese countryside where graves have begun to be leveled and public cemeteries established, I suddenly thought that the corpses of imperialism certainly have no right to enter the people's cemetery; the graveyard of imperialism will probably have no place to be set up, and imperialism will probably die without a burial place!

    美景与坟场
    康濯
    在最近美英帝国主义侵略中东国家的日子，我正生活在农村里共产主义的新芽竞相滋长的美景之中。
    中国正在以宇宙飞行的速度奔腾前进。不久以前，农村里五十来岁的人们还在担心自己看不到共产主义的美好时光；现在，八九十岁的老人却都喜笑颜开地坚信自己能够享受到共产主义的幸福。有的老汉甚至还固执地认为自己已经过上了共产主义。徐水县大寺各庄谢国珍大娘的老伴已经八十七岁，他在前些天村里发电站开始送电的日子，后半夜还独个儿坐在明灿灿的街里不肯睡觉；他老伴从地里打夜班回来，好不惊奇地催他家去，他却说：“你要睡你先走，我还要再尝尝这共产主义的味儿！”
    当然，发电并不就是共产主义。但那个八十七岁老汉所说的话也确有另外的道理。和徐水县所有的农业社一样，大寺各庄老早就办起了食堂，其中并有一座受到优待的幼儿和老人的食堂。幼儿园同样早已成立，并已不让各户供养自己的小孩，而由全社统一供给。更重要的是，大寺各庄也和全县各地一样，早就消灭了社员个人的自留地和平毁了坟堆。猪只全部是社里喂养。破旧房屋和锅台全部拆除，土坯上了地，好砖正准备盖新楼房；那些楼房将按各户人口多少分配住处，而不按各户原有旧房的数目分配。供销社和信用社都成了农业社的一部分，这些方面的工作正跟随全县集市的取消而在逐步缩短着城乡的距离。农业社还有十几台机器，有粮食加工和土制化肥等工厂，有缝纫部和理发员。农田管理在土地全面平整过后也像工厂一样地实现了专业队和专业化，社里的庄稼实在茂盛得出奇。俱乐部也快要做到幻灯广播和书画琴棋样样有。一句话，共产主义的新芽已经雨后春笋一般地在大寺各庄和徐水各处破土而出，饱含共产主义的人民公社制度已经开始在这儿具体地、逐步地实现。一年以前，甚至就在几个月以前，谁曾想到如此美好的理想会在这么快的时日中开始成为现实？党的总路线和中国人民伟大无穷的创造力，正在使得我们的生活不仅是一天等于二十年，并且甚至是一天等于二百年、二千年。
    我不打算更多地叙述大寺各庄的另外好些美景。我只是不能不在这里再次提起那儿开始电气化的时光。那是徐水农村的第一座发电站，在7月18日的夜晚，县里在那儿召开了一个庆祝电站竣工的万人大会。刚刚开始送电的时候那突然豁亮的灯火，刹时就通过大会把全县三十多万人民的心照得火热透明。那是怎样一个震动云霄的欢乐而迷人的大会啊！不过，那个欢腾的大会后来竟突然而又合理的变成了一个怒吼的海洋。万人振臂高呼反对美英帝国主义侵略中东，决心全力支援阿拉伯弟兄的斗争；会场上无边的激愤直越过电灯光网，冲向九重天上。并且问题还不仅是声音和气势，还在于人们为电气化美景所鼓舞以及被帝国主义的海盗行为所激动，马上就纷纷加强了实际行动。人们当场找窍门挖潜力，大寺各庄农业社一马当先，把他们今年亩产万斤粮的指标又提到了一万五；另外还出现了亩产万斤乡。大家都保证要拿更大的高产作为卫星上天，拿大面积高产作为元帅升帐，以便在生产上更快地超过英美，来支援阿拉伯人民。在这里，海盗主义的行为和中国农村的电气化正好交映成黑白分明的对照。透亮的电灯从正面燃烧起大家火焰熊熊的热情，海盗们的黑色罪行则从反面激愤得人民鼓起了更大的干劲。
    而人民干劲的增长却决不只是这儿大寺各庄的一处会场。现在世界上如同大寺各庄一样处于大跃进的建设中的城乡何止千万！已经挣脱和正在挣脱殖民锁链的人民，以及为和平民主而斗争的资本主义国家的人民更何止亿万！所有这亿万人民如今都正以海洋怒吼之势的抗议和更加积极的实际行动，在反对美英海盗的罪行和支援阿拉伯的兄弟。人民的阵营人多，干劲大，正义在握，武器也是第一，正如早晨的太阳；帝国主义却已经没有哪一门站得住脚。这伙海盗已是夕阳西下，疯狂的侵略也不过如反照的回光。帝国主义苦心豢养的伊拉克王朝只不过两个钟头就被人民推翻，便说明了海盗们已步上垮台的速度一天等于二十年二百年的轨道。帝国主义的前途，只不过是在哪里侵略，坟场就在哪里罢了。并且，我还从中国农村已经开始平毁坟堆和建立公墓的情景，忽然想到帝国主义的尸体自是没有权利进入人民公墓的；帝国主义的坟场恐怕还将会是无地可设，帝国主义恐怕还将会是死无葬身之地呢！
