　　Strive to Popularize Methane in Two Years
　　Commentator of this newspaper
    The Ministry of Agriculture recently held a national methane on-site meeting in Heshan County, Guangdong Province, requiring all parts of the country to universally utilize natural methane and man-made methane within the next two years. This is a matter of great significance.

    Since the overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the people have universally demanded the exploitation of various natural energy sources to improve labor productivity and raise the people's material and cultural life. Currently, some regions have begun to study and promote the use of methane, which marks a new path in the utilization of natural energy.

    Local practices have proved that methane has extremely broad uses. It can be used to generate electricity, for lighting, to boil water, cook food, and can also be used to drive cars and tractors. This can greatly save petroleum, coal, and firewood. Compared with ordinary unfermented farmyard manure and compost, the fertilizer after fermentation and release of methane can increase fertilizer efficiency by three to five times, which is extremely beneficial for increasing production. Most harmful bacteria and microorganisms can be killed after fermentation of manure, sewage, waste, etc. This also has a great effect on improving environmental sanitation, eliminating mosquitoes and flies, and preventing diseases. In addition, methane itself is also an important chemical raw material, which can be used to produce carbon tetrachloride, carbon black, etc. for industrial, medical, and health needs through processing and manufacturing. The Foshan Special District of Guangdong Province is very strained in terms of fertilizer. On the one hand, the quantity cannot meet the needs of multiple cropping systems per year, and on the other hand, the labor force for transporting fertilizer is insufficient after a large increase in fertilizer application. After mobilizing the masses and universally promoting the use of methane, from April to July, the entire special district built 250 methane tanks with a volume of more than 50 cubic meters and more than 60,000 thatch pool tanks. As a result, a wide range of fertilizer sources were opened up: in addition to human and animal manure, straw, garbage, sewage, waste, etc. have all become valuable organic fertilizers. Heshan County built many small methane tanks in the fields to attract moths and kill insects with lights, and at the same time accumulate fertilizer locally, reducing the large amount of labor required to transport fertilizer. At the same time, it also solved the problem of fuel and power for some rural areas. The members of the agricultural cooperatives sang: "The thatch pool tank is a fertilizer factory and also a kerosene factory. It emits methane to burn fire, generate electricity and light, and the production of fertilizer is inexhaustible. Cooking, lighting, and generating electricity replace people's labor." Other areas with universal use of methane have similar songs among farmers.

    There are still some people who say that researching methane is a matter for scientists and that the masses cannot do it, and that it is impossible to universally utilize it in various parts of the country quickly. These people cannot see the facts with their eyes open, so conservative ideas cannot always be overcome. In fact, under the leadership of the local party and government, the masses in many places have universally launched movements and created many good methods in all aspects of natural methane collection, transportation, storage, and use. Taking Fuyang, Anhui as an example, when collecting methane at the beginning, people had to go into the water, use their feet as agitators, and use wooden or iron buckets to collect it. Later, they changed to using boats to collect it with buckets. Now, they have created a methane boat with a gas collecting box and agitator installed, which not only liberates people from the water, but also operates easily and flexibly, and can collect four to six cubic meters of methane every half hour, which is more than twice as efficient as people working in the water. In terms of transportation, due to the universal and large-scale collection of natural methane, rubber tubes and glass tubes could not be supplied in time, so the masses created methods such as using reed stalks as glass tubes and chicken intestines as rubber tubes. In terms of gas storage, they also created various equipment such as gas storage tanks, gas storage cylinders, and gas storage bags. In terms of gas use, they even created earthen-made methane light bulbs, each costing only two cents, which is equivalent to one-tenth of the price of factory products. They also created lamp holders, mud stoves, etc. Because they actively created many new methods, the original plan to achieve universal methane utilization throughout the county before October 1st was basically realized by the end of July. These facts clearly show that the key to the problem lies in fully mobilizing the masses and resolutely taking the mass line. As long as this is done, the effects of short time, quick results, many methods, and less money can be achieved. On the contrary, some places mystify the methane work, only hand it over to some scientists to study, only conduct experiments in the laboratory, and do not let it meet the broad masses, so the promotion and utilization is very slow. After doing it for a few months or even longer, they cannot make any significant achievements. Isn't this a stark contrast?

    This is by no means to say that scientific research work can be underestimated. Scientific research work should be valued and strengthened. However, scientific research work must be well combined with production, combined with the wisdom of the masses, and serve the masses and production. Scientists should not only sit in the laboratory to conduct experiments, but should often go to the masses to learn, study, and experiment, and at the same time help the masses solve problems in production. Only in this way can scientific work be developed and prospered.

    The National Methane On-site Conference determined that the current methane activities should focus on solving fertilizer, fuel, and power problems, promoting the faster mechanization and electrification of production, liberating the labor force, and better serving the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and cultural and health undertakings; at the same time, it requires equal emphasis on urban and rural areas, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, comprehensive utilization, close cooperation among relevant departments, and a combination of large, medium, and small sizes. Under the joint efforts of the broad masses and scientific workers, these correct policies will surely achieve success quickly.

　　争取两年普及沼气
　　本报评论员
    农业部最近在广东省鹤山县召开了全国沼气现场会议，要求全国各地在今明两年内普遍地把自然沼气和人造沼气利用起来，这是一件意义重大的事情。
    工农业生产全面大跃进以来，人民群众普遍要求发掘自然界的各种能源，用以提高劳动生产率，提高人民的物质和文化生活。
  目前一部分地区开始研究和推广沼气的利用，这标志着人们在利用自然能源方面开辟了一个新的途径。
    各地实践证明，沼气的用途极其广阔。它可以用来发电，照明，烧水，煮饭，也可以用来开动汽车和拖拉机。这样就可以大量地节省石油、燃煤和柴炭。经过发酵放出沼气后的肥料，和一般未经发酵的厩肥、堆肥相比，可以提高肥效三倍至五倍，极有利于增产。粪便、污物、废料等经过发酵，大部分有害的细菌和微生物都可以杀死。这对于改善环境卫生、消灭蚊蝇、防止疾疫，也有很大作用。此外，沼气本身还是一种重要的化学工业原料，通过加工制造，可以制取四氯化碳、碳黑等，以供工业和医药卫生上的需要。广东省佛山专区肥料问题很紧张，一方面是在数量上不能满足一年多熟制的需要，另方面是大量增加施肥量以后运肥的劳力不足。经过发动群众，普遍推广利用沼气，从4月份到7月份，全专区建造了五十立方公尺以上的沼气池二百五十个，茅池缸六万多个，结果开辟了广泛的肥源：除人、畜粪便之外，藁秆、垃圾、污水、废物等都变成了可贵的有机肥料。鹤山县在田头建造了不少小型沼气池，用以点灯诱蛾、杀虫，同时就地积肥，减少了搬运肥料所需要的大量劳动。与此同时，还解决了农村中一部分燃料和动力的问题。农业社的社员们歌唱着：“茅池缸，是肥厂，又是煤油厂，发出沼气能烧火，发电又发光，生产肥料用不尽，煮饭照明发电代人忙。”其他利用沼气普遍的地区，农民中都有类似的歌唱。
    现在还有一些人在说研究沼气是科学家的事，群众办不了，不可能很快地在全国各地普遍利用。这些人睁眼看不到事实，所以保守思想总是不能克服。事实上，许多地方的群众在当地党和政府的领导下，已经普遍掀起运动，在自然沼气的收集、运送、贮存一直到使用等各方面，创造了许多很好的办法。以安徽阜阳为例，开始收集沼气的时候，人要下到水里，用脚当搅拌器，用木桶或铁桶收集。后来改用船带桶收集。现在又创造了一种沼气船，安装集气箱和搅拌器，不仅把人从水里解放了出来，而且操作轻便灵活，每半小时即可收集四至六立方公尺的沼气，比人下水去工作提高效率一倍以上。在运送上，由于普遍地大量收集自然沼气，橡皮管和玻璃管一时供应不上，于是群众又创造了芦苇秆当玻璃管，鸡肠子当橡皮管等办法。在贮气上，他们也创造了贮气池、贮气缸、贮气袋等多种设备。用气方面，更创造了土法制的沼气灯泡，每个成本仅二分钱，相当于工厂出品十几分之一。还创造了灯头、泥炉等。由于他们积极地创造了许多新的办法，原订10月1日以前实现全县普遍利用沼气的计划，提前到7月底就基本实现了。这些事实清楚地说明，问题的关键就在于充分发动群众，坚决走群众路线。只要这样做，就能够达到时间短，收效快，办法多，花钱少的效果。相反的，有些地方把沼气工作神秘化起来，只交给一些科学家去研究，只关在实验室里搞试验，而不让它和广大群众见面，结果推广利用就十分缓慢。搞了几个月甚至更长的时间，做不出什么显著的成绩。这不是一个鲜明的对比么？
    这里决不是说可以轻视科学研究工作。科学研究工作是应当重视和加强的。但是，科学研究工作必须很好地和生产结合起来，和群众的智慧结合起来，为群众、为生产服务。科学家不应当只坐在实验室里搞试验，而应当经常到群众中去学习、研究，试验，同时帮助群众解决生产上的问题。只有这样，科学工作才能发达、繁荣。
    全国沼气现场会议确定当前沼气的活动，以解决肥料、燃料和动力为主，促进生产更快地机械化和电气化，解放劳动力，更好地为工农业生产和文化卫生事业的大跃进服务；同时要求城乡并重，土洋结合，因地制宜，综合利用，有关部门通力协作，大中小型并举。这些正确的方针，在广大群众和科学工作者共同努力之下，一定会很快地取得成就。
