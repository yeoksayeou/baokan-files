Xinhua News Agency Reports: Cairo's "People's News" editorial on the 18th emphasized that "Just as we have rejected the Eisenhower Plan, we will not accept the Norwegian proposal."

The newspaper pointed out that the planned Norwegian proposal will be put forward by Western countries supporting the US scheme, and its purpose is obviously to delay the United Nations General Assembly's emergency meeting on the Middle East issue. The newspaper stressed that the situation in the Middle East cannot tolerate any delay. The occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British troops constitutes a serious aggression against the territories of these two Arab countries and a direct threat to other Arab countries and peace in the Middle East.

The newspaper reiterated, "What we insist on is that British and American troops should withdraw from the Middle East as quickly as possible without delay, and then other issues can be considered."

The newspaper's commentary on the 17th also pointed out: The proposal prepared by the Norwegian representative is nothing more than an attempt to maintain the Eisenhower Plan, which is opposed by the Arabs, for the West.

The commentary said that the Eisenhower Plan is unacceptable because it not only circumvents the main issue of withdrawing US and British troops, but also attempts to implement international trusteeship in the Middle East through "international peacekeeping forces." In fact, Eisenhower linked this so-called "peacekeeping force" to the withdrawal of US and British troops.

### 美国方案贴挪威商标　开罗“人民报”说阿拉伯人决不接受

　　美国方案贴挪威商标
　　开罗“人民报”说阿拉伯人决不接受
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：开罗“人民报”社论18日强调说，“如同我们已经拒绝了艾森豪威尔方案一样，我们不会接受挪威提案”。
    这家报纸指出，策划中的挪威提案将代表支持美国方案的西方国家提出，其目的显然是要拖延联合国大会紧急会议对中东问题的讨论。这家报纸着重指出，中东局势不容有任何拖延。美英军队占领黎巴嫩和约旦，构成对这两个阿拉伯国家领土的严重侵略，和对其他阿拉伯国家和中东和平的直接威胁。
    这家报纸重申，“我们所坚持的是，英美军队应当尽可能毫不拖延地撤出中东，然后才能考虑其他问题”。
    这家报纸在17日的评论里也曾指出：挪威代表准备的提案无非是企图替西方保持为阿拉伯人所反对的艾森豪威尔计划。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔计划是不能接受的，因为它不但规避撤退美英军队这一主要问题，而且想通过“国际和平部队”对中东实行国际托管。事实上艾森豪威尔把这支所谓的“和平部队”同撤退美英军队的问题联系了起来。
