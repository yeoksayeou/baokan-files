　　中苏签订技术援助协定
　　苏联援助我国建设和扩建冶金、化学等企业
    新华社莫斯科12日电　中国和苏联在真诚、友好、和相互充分了解的气氛中进行谈判之后，8月8日在莫斯科签订了一项关于苏联在技术上援助中国建设和扩建冶金、化学、煤炭、机械制造、木材加工、建筑材料工业企业和电站等的两国政府间的协议。
    协议规定，由苏联有关机构完成某些企业的勘查、研究和设计工作，提供个别车间和装置的重复利用的设计，负责供应部分的工艺设备、仪表和电缆以及在现场制造成套设备所需要的若干专用材料，派遣必要的专家帮助安装、调整和企业的开工生产，并且帮助中国培养能在上述企业中工作的本国干部。
    由于中国在发展工业和培养本国工程技术干部方面获得的成就，中国自己将承担大部分上述企业的设计、勘查和研究工作。中国机械制造业为上述企业提供成套设备。
    协议规定，苏联方面无偿地将产品的生产特许权转让给中国方面，提供这些企业组织生产产品所需要的图纸和其它技术资料。中国方面只偿付编制和移交上述技术资料的实际费用。本协议所列举的由苏联提供的技术援助的费用，由中国方面按照现行中苏贸易协定的条件以货物偿付给苏联。
    这一协议的签订将促进两国经济关系和建立在完全平等、互利和兄弟般互助基础上的全面合作获得进一步的发展和巩固。
