　　Not Afraid of Failing to Revolutionize, Only Afraid of Not Revolutionizing
    Ministry of Foreign Trade Rolls Up a High Tide of Technological and Cultural Revolution

    (Reported by this newspaper) Can state organs compete for the top spot in the torrent of the technological and cultural revolution? The Ministry of Foreign Trade has provided an affirmative answer with abundant facts.

    In just over a month, this ministry has proposed more than 8,800 innovation measures and suggestions, and more than 2,000 of them have been successfully tested or adopted and implemented.

    When the Ministry of Foreign Trade victoriously concluded the rectification movement and began to shift to the technological revolution and cultural revolution movement, some comrades expressed doubts about launching the technological revolution movement in the organs. They said: Organs are not like factories or rural areas, there is not much technical work, and there is no way to launch the technological revolution movement. At this time, the leaders of the ministry immediately adopted the method of "great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters" to criticize the idea of ​​"special theory." At the same time, they held an on-site meeting in the advanced unit - the Animal Products Company. When this company started the technological revolution, some people also thought that the conditions were poor and it would not work. However, after criticizing the idea of ​​"conditions theory," they have proposed nearly 200 innovation measures in product acquisition, processing, organization of exports, etc., most of which have been successfully tested. As a result, everyone's thinking was cleared, and they believed that "as long as we establish the idea of ​​innovation, everything can be innovated, and everyone can create."

    On the basis of improved ideological understanding, everyone worked hard, drilled deeply, worked hard and cleverly, and quickly launched a mass upsurge of everyone contributing ideas and suggestions, and everyone inventing and creating in the entire scope. First of all, in the business departments, a mass upsurge was launched to improve the operation and management of foreign trade, improve the scientific and technological level of foreign trade, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of foreign trade plans in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    The China Native Produce Export Company successfully tested the method of bleaching walnut skins, which can increase the selling price by 100%.

    China National Import and Export Corporation changed the import of pesticides to import pesticide raw materials for domestic processing and production, which not only solved the urgent needs of agricultural production, but also reduced costs by two-thirds and saved a lot of foreign exchange.

    In terms of technology, a wave of innovation in production tools, power, and operating methods has been set off. The driver team innovated 33 tools in just over a month. In the past, the typing group had always viewed the words from the opposite side, and no one had ever thought it was unreasonable. This time, technician Qiu Jinsheng boldly questioned it. He thought: Typing like in the past is both tiring and hard on the eyes, which is very unreasonable. He used his brains to modify a typewriter. After the modification, not only can he view the words from the front, but also use electricity to type. In this way, work efficiency is increased by three times. Another example is that the heating wire used for melting lead characters in the lead printing plant often breaks. This time, the comrades in the lead printing plant tried to modify the furnace plate, and the utilization rate of the heating wire was greatly improved. It is estimated that one plate of heating wire can be used for more than one year, greatly exceeding the service life of American heating wire. In addition to these technical aspects, in general office work, such as archives, printing, secretarial work, translation, and communication liaison, etc., they are also engaged in inventions and creations, or improving work methods and reforming rules and regulations. The cadres of the Second Bureau of the Ministry worked hard for ten days and compiled an overview of the economic and trade conditions of Eastern European countries, which is of reference value for systematically understanding trade conditions and studying policies. The reception office also launched a "multi-skilled" movement. At present, except for a few older comrades, all of them have learned the four skills of interpretation, translation, communication liaison, and typing. The office also created many miracles in translation work. For example, 60-year-old translator Wu Zhibin translated more than 300 kinds of Chinese medicines into foreign languages ​​in six days, solving the difficulty of introducing Chinese medicines to foreign guests. In terms of financial accounting, they abolished hundreds of unnecessary accounts and forms, and adopted the method of using one account to replace forty or fifty notes of bookkeeping and reconciliation, which increased work efficiency by more than ten times.

    In addition, in some units with strong administrative functions, such as the kitchen and the public service team, they are also engaged in innovation. The kitchen created a "filling rubbing machine" to replace manual rubbing of fillings with a machine, which increased work efficiency by more than four times. Technician Qiu Jinsheng created a "glass cleaning device". When cleaning, there is no need to climb high to wipe the glass. Standing on the ground, you can wipe the highest glass. At present, the Ministry of Foreign Trade has formed such a situation: wherever someone is doing work, the work there is being innovated. (Attached photo)

### 不怕不能革命　只怕不去革命  外贸部卷起技术革命和文化革命高潮

　　不怕不能革命　只怕不去革命
    外贸部卷起技术革命和文化革命高潮
    本报讯　在技术革命和文化革命的洪流中，国家机关能不能争得上游，对外贸易部以丰富的事实作了肯定的答复。
    一个多月来，这个部已经提出各种革新措施和建议八千八百多件，并已有二千多件试验成功或采纳实行。
    外贸部在整风运动胜利结束，开始转入技术革命、文化革命运动时，曾有部分同志对于在机关里开展技术革命运动表示怀疑，他们说：机关不像工厂、农村，技术性的工作不多，没办法开展技术革命运动。这时，部领导上即采取大鸣大放大争大辩和贴大字报的办法，批判了“特殊论”的思想，同时又在先进单位——畜产公司召开了现场会议。这个公司在开始搞技术革命时，也曾有人认为条件差，行不通，但是，在批判“条件论”的思想以后，已经在产品收购、加工、组织出口等等方面提出了近二百项革新措施，其中极大部分已经试验成功。这一来，大家的思想通了，认为“只要树立革新思想，事事可以革新，人人可以创造”。
    在思想认识提高的基础上，大家苦想深钻，苦干巧干，在全部范围内很快掀起了一个人人献计献策，个个发明创造的高潮。首先在业务部门掀起了改善对外贸易经营管理、提高对外贸易科学技术水平、保证多快好省地完成和超额完成对外贸易计划的群众性的热潮。
    中国土产出口公司试验成功漂白核桃皮的方法，可以提高售价一倍。
  中国进出口公司，将进口农药改为进口农药原料在国内加工生产，不仅解决了农业生产上的急需，而且降低了成本三分之二，节约大量外汇。
    在技术方面，掀起了革新生产工具、动力和操作方法的热潮，司机班在短短的一个多月当中，革新工具三十三件。过去，打字组一直是从反面看字，从来没有人认为不合理。这次，技工丘金生就大胆怀疑了，他想：像过去那样打字，手既累，眼也吃力，很不合理，他就动脑筋改装了一部打字机，改装以后，不仅可以从正面看字，而且还能用电力打字。这样，工作效率提高三倍。再比如铅印所化铅字用的热力丝经常断。这次，铅印所的同志设法改装了炉盘，热力丝使用率大大提高，估计一盘热力丝能使用一年以上，大大超过了美国热力丝的使用期限。除过这些带有技术性的以外，在一般机关工作当中，如档案、文印、秘书、翻译、交际联络等等方面，也都在搞发明创造，或是改进工作方法，改革规章制度。该部第二局的干部苦战十天，编出了东欧各国的经济贸易概况，这对系统了解贸易情况，研究政策有参考价值。交际处还开展了“多面手”运动。目前，该处除个别年老的同志外，已全部学会了口译、笔译、交际联络、打字四种本事。该处在翻译工作当中，还创造了许多奇迹。如六十岁的翻译武止滨同志在六天当中，把三百多种中药译成外文，解决了向国外客人介绍中药时的困难。在财会工作方面，他们废除了成百种不必要的账目和表格，采取一笔账代替四、五十笔记账和对账的方法，工作效率提高了十倍以上。
    此外，在一些事务性较强的单位，如炊事房、公务班，也在搞革新，炊事房创造了一个“擦馅机”，以机器代替人工擦馅，工作效率提高四倍以上。技工丘金生创造了一个“擦玻璃器”，打扫清洁卫生时，可以不用登高擦玻璃了，站在地上，就可以擦到最高处的玻璃。目前，在外贸部已经形成这样一个状况：那里有人在做工作，那里的工作就在被革新。（附图片）
