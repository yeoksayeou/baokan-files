Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 15th: Iraqi Republic Premier Kassem told Xinhua reporters here on the 15th that the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev made the world realize the true importance of the problems in the Middle East region and seriously consider how to solve these problems.

Kassem answered questions raised by the reporter when he received the reporter from this agency in a private meeting.

The reporter asked Premier Kassem his views on the UN General Assembly emergency meeting, and what measures the UN General Assembly should take to force US and British troops to immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan to ease the tense situation in the Middle East.

In his reply, he expressed his belief that the United Nations would wisely devote itself to solving this problem, and that foreign troops would withdraw soon. He said that such a result would be able to satisfy the people of this region.

Kassem, in answering the question of what actions the Iraqi government and people will take to defend the republic and resist any imperialist aggression, said that without a doubt, we are determined to defend ourselves; anyone with such determination knows how to stop aggression. Those who once formulated absolutely secret, accurate, and swift plans to overthrow the old regime know how to formulate accurate plans to stop any aggression. He also said that despite this, we will ask the United Nations and other friendly countries to help oppose such aggression. But we will rely on ourselves first.

Kassem finally spoke about strengthening the friendly relations between China and Iraq.

He said that although our two countries are far apart, the Iraqi people have long loved the Chinese people. We learned in school that China was the first country in the world to contribute to human civilization. Therefore, the Iraqi people's impression of China is friendly and respectful. We already have this mutual understanding between our two countries, and I am sure that as time goes on, this relationship will develop and strengthen; this relationship should be built on the basis of mutually beneficial economic relations, and also on the basis of culture. He emphasized that the first action taken by the Iraqi Republic was to recognize the People's Republic of China.

　　卡塞姆总理对新华社记者说
　　中伊友好关系将得到发展
　　希望联合国致力解决使美英撤军问题
    新华社巴格达15日电　伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆15日在这里对新华社记者说，毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈使世界认识到中东地区的问题的真正重要性，并且认真地考虑怎样来解决这些问题。
    卡塞姆在单独接见本社记者的时候答复了记者提出的问题。
    记者问卡塞姆总理对联合国大会紧急会议的看法如何，联合国大会应该采取一些什么措施来迫使美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，以缓和中东紧张局势。
    他在回答中表示，他相信联合国会明智地致力于解决这个问题，并且外国军队将会很快撤退，他说，这样的结果将能够使这个地区的人民感到满意。
    卡塞姆在回答关于伊拉克政府和人民将采取什么行动来保卫共和国、抵御帝国主义的任何侵略的问题时说，毫无疑问，我们决心保卫我们自己；任何有这种决心的人都知道怎样来制止侵略。曾经绝对秘密、准确和迅速地制订计划来推翻旧政权的人们，知道怎样制订准确的计划来制止任何侵略。他又说，尽管如此，我们将要求联合国和其他友好国家来帮助反对这种侵略。但是我们将首先依靠我们自己。
    卡塞姆最后谈到了加强中国和伊拉克之间的友好关系的问题。
    他说，尽管我们两国相距很远，伊拉克人民很早以来就喜爱中国人民。我们在学校里学到，中国是世界上对人类文明作出贡献的第一个国家。因此，伊拉克人民对中国的印象是友好和尊重的。我们两国之间已经有了这种相互的了解，我确信，随着时间的推移，这种关系将会得到发展和加强；这种关系应该建立在经济互利的基础上，也应该建立在文化的基础上。他强调说，伊拉克共和国所采取的第一个行动就是承认中华人民共和国。
