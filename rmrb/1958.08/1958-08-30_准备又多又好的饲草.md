Prepare More and Better Fodder
By Our Commentator

    China's large and small livestock have developed rapidly in the first half of this year. As of June, the number of pigs raised nationwide has reached 180 million. The number of large livestock mated accounts for more than half of the eligible female animals. The breeding rate of sheep has also increased significantly. With more livestock, more feed is needed. How to increase feed production to adapt to the great development of livestock this year and in the first half of next year has become a very important issue in agriculture.

    In recent years, a common problem encountered in livestock breeding in China has been insufficient feed. In the past year or two, many areas have experienced livestock emaciation and death, mainly due to insufficient feed and poor feed quality. Two years ago, some areas in the North China Plain, due to insufficient feed, had to purchase and transport fodder from Heilongjiang and other provinces thousands of miles away, causing huge waste. This is a lesson that cannot be forgotten.

    This year, China's agricultural production has made great progress, and the yield per unit area of various crops has generally increased. This situation gives people the illusion that with more grain, there will be no problem with livestock feed. The actual situation is not like that. With more grain, the amount of grain used for feed can be increased somewhat, but not too much. In terms of the needs of the livestock themselves and the requirements of reducing the cost of raising livestock, it is not possible to rely solely on grain feed and dispense with fodder.

    This year, the yield per unit area of grain has increased, and the output of grain crop stalks has also increased. With more stalks, is there still worry that livestock will not have anything to eat? Quantitatively speaking, there is more fodder, but using dry stalks as feed is not very good. This is only a practice formed under certain historical conditions. As agricultural production develops, this practice should also be changed, that is, better fodder should be used to replace rough fodder. We have the conditions to make livestock eat better, grow faster, and become stronger. Why not do this? Both large quantities and good quality should be the common requirements for fodder reserves in various regions this year.

    Autumn crops have entered the late stage of growth, and crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and sorghum will gradually mature. The fodder reserve plan for each region and each production unit this year should be formulated and deployed quickly. Judging from past experience, formulating plans and having specific arrangements are effective measures for doing a good job in fodder reserves. This year, many regions have increased the amount of silage, and some regions are also preparing to ensile everything that can be ensiled. Such a large-scale adoption of ensiling, turning dry and rough fodder into green and juicy fodder, is a major reform in China's fodder reserves. Such a large-scale reform must be planned early. This requires Party committees at all levels to take the lead and start early to rapidly develop the silage movement. Due to the very tight field management and harvest preparation work in the later stage of autumn crops, all regions must properly arrange time so that all tasks can be carried out in an orderly manner.

　　准备又多又好的饲草
　　本报评论员
    我国大小牲畜今年上半年都有飞跃的发展。截至6月，全国养猪数已达一亿八千万头。大牲畜的配种数占适龄母畜一半以上。羊的繁殖率也提高很多。牲畜多了，需要的饲料也就多了。如何增加饲料，适应今年和明年上半年牲畜的大发展，成了农业上一个很值得重视的问题。
    近几年来，我国饲养牲畜中遇到的普遍性问题就是饲料不足。最近一、二年不少地区发生牲畜瘦弱死亡现象，主要原因就是饲料不足和饲料质量不好。前年和去年华北平原一些地区因为饲料不足，曾经到几千里地以外的黑龙江等省购运饲草，造成巨大浪费。这是一个不能忘掉的教训。
    今年我国的农业生产有了巨大的发展，各种作物的单位面积产量普遍提高。这个情况给人造成这样一种错觉：粮食多了，牲畜的饲料就没有问题了。实际情况不是这样。粮食多了，饲料用粮可以有所增加，但不能增加太多。就牲畜本身的需要和降低饲养牲畜成本的要求说，也不能单靠粮食喂养，不要饲草。
    今年粮食单位面积产量提高了，粮食作物秸秆的产量也多了，秸秆多了还愁牲口没有吃的吗？从数量上说，饲草是多了，但是，用干枯的秸秆做饲料，并不是很好的。这只是在一定的历史条件下形成的一种作法。农业生产发展了，这种做法也应当改变，就是说，应当用较好的饲草来代替粗糙的饲草。我们有条件使牲畜吃得好些，长得快些、壮些，为什么不这样作呢？数量既多，质量又好，应当是今年各地储备饲草的普遍要求。
    大秋作物已进入生长后期，玉米、甘薯、花生、高粱等作物都要逐渐成熟。每个地区、每个生产单位今年的储备饲草计划，应当很快制定出来，布置下去。从过去的经验看，制定计划并有具体安排，是做好储备饲草工作的有效措施。今年许多地区都提高了青贮饲草的数量，有些地区还准备把所有可以青贮的东西全部青贮起来。这样大规模地采用青贮的办法，变干枯粗糙的饲草为青绿多汁的饲草，是我国储备饲草上一项重大改革。这样大规模的改革，必须及早计划。这就需要各地党委抓紧领导，及早动手，把青贮运动迅速开展起来。由于大秋作物后期的田间管理和收获准备工作非常紧张，各地必须妥善安排时间，使各项工作都能有条不紊地进行。
