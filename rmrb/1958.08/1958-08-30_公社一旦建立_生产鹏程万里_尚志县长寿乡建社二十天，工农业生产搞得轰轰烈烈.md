　　Once the Commune is Established, Production Will Soar
    Changshou Township, Shangzhi County, Has Seen a Vigorous Development of Industry and Agriculture in the Twenty Days Since the Establishment of the Commune
    Our newspaper's dispatch from Harbin, August 29th: Changshou Township in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, merged all twenty-three agricultural cooperatives in the township into one people's commune in late July, based on the need for comprehensive development of production and the urgent demands of the vast number of cooperative members.
    This people's commune currently has 3,755 households, with a population of 15,000, and cultivates over 118,000 mu of land, including over 23,000 mu of paddy fields. The natural conditions of this commune are "six parts mountain, one part water, and three parts farmland," with mineral resources, grasslands, and rivers, suitable for developing diverse production such as agriculture, industry, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, and handicrafts. After the establishment of the people's commune, the township implemented the integration of township and commune, the integration of agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives, and combined industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs into one entity. Although this township has only established the people's commune for a short time, it has begun to demonstrate unparalleled superiority in promoting current production and preparations for next year's production.
    Small Cooperatives Became a Hindrance
    Before the establishment of the commune, agricultural cooperatives encountered a common problem in the great leap forward in production: the leap forward plans were not compatible with the labor and material resources of the small cooperatives. This was mainly manifested in four aspects: (1) The cooperatives were small with little labor, unable to fully utilize resources, and could not engage in diverse operations despite "eyeing them greedily." Among the twenty-three cooperatives in the township, only ten had pastures. Wanfa Cooperative had a stretch of shallow mountains forty-five li in circumference, with natural fish ponds, suitable for developing animal husbandry, horticulture, fish farming, and other production, but was unable to develop it due to its small size. However, Success Cooperative had more than 300 sheep, but because the pasture was too small, it could not develop further and had to implement the method of "selling any number exceeding 300." (2) With many cooperatives, there were many water usage conflicts. Due to the lack of unified planning, each acted independently, often with one blocking the other, negating each other's efforts. (3) With small cooperatives and weak strength, they mostly considered their own cooperative when encountering problems, and there was no strength to carry out long-term basic construction throughout the township. (4) Small cooperatives affected the rational utilization of land and mechanized farming operations. These contradictions all demonstrated that small cooperatives were no longer suitable in the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production. During the airing of views and debates last winter, some cooperative members proposed merging cooperatives. At several township and cooperative cadre meetings this spring, cooperative cadres put up big-character posters to township leaders, demanding the merging of cooperatives, saying: "If we don't merge cooperatives, it will affect production!" When cooperative cadres met, they discussed and secretly linked up to merge cooperatives.
    Each agricultural cooperative had the desire to establish a people's commune, so what should be done? The township Party committee convened a meeting of Party branch secretaries and directors of small cooperatives to study this issue, and decided to build a people's commune in the entire township, and established a preparatory committee for the establishment of the commune.
    Comprehensive Development of Industry and Agriculture
    After carrying out propaganda and education on the issue of establishing a commune and extensive airing of views and great debates among Party members, Youth League members, and the broad masses, the vast number of cadres and cooperative members were all overjoyed, elated, and enthusiastically signed up to join the commune, universally proposing to greet the establishment of the commune with practical actions to improve production. Wanfa Cooperative, with 160 households, launched a night-time campaign to press green manure with lanterns, pressing 5,700 tons of fertilizer in three days and reporting to the commune as a gift.
    At the beginning of the establishment of the commune, they began to formulate the commune's 1959 production plan, and discussed and adopted the draft plan at the first representative congress of the people's commune. In terms of agricultural production, grain output will be doubled, with each mu producing 1,000 jin of grain; in terms of industrial production, factories such as crystal stone factories, peat factories, and brick factories will be established, with an output value of 3,287,000 yuan; the output value of animal husbandry will be 1,280,000 yuan, and the total income from various aspects of production can reach about 10 million yuan. Such a leap in development was simply unimaginable for small cooperatives. Encouraged by the slogans of "7,500 this year (7,500 jin of grain per hectare), double it next year," "Turn deep mountains into mountains of treasure, shallow mountains into orchards, springs into fish ponds, and flatlands into rice fields," the cooperative members were full of enthusiasm. By mid-August, the entire commune had pressed 338,000 tons of green manure, which can be used for 70% of the cultivated land area. With another ten days of hard work, they will be able to realize the plan of applying ten tons of fertilizer per mu next year. In order to realize water conservancy, 400 wells were drilled after the establishment of the commune, and 500 people were drawn to build reservoirs in Heilonggong. The water conservancy irrigation and drainage system has also begun to be rectified. Now, most of the industries run by the commune have begun to be prepared for construction, peat factories, milk powder factories, etc. are being built, and brick factories, crystal stone factories, etc. have started production. The establishment of the commune in just twenty days has shown such tremendous superiority, which has further encouraged the confidence and determination of cadres and cooperative members to run the commune well.
    How to Establish a People's Commune
    The main experiences of Changshou Township in establishing a people's commune are: First, fully carry out ideological mobilization, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and eliminate capitalist, egalitarian, and departmentalist ideological obstacles through great debates, which is a key to doing a good job in commune establishment. The entire process of merging cooperatives is a process of fighting these ideas. Only by distinguishing right from wrong, breaking the old and establishing the new, can we encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for production and commune establishment, and ensure that the commune establishment work is carried out quickly and well. Second, the process of establishing a people's commune is also a process of developing a high tide of production. The experience of Changshou Township proves that grasping the commune's production leap forward plan, promoting current production and preparations for next year's production, and immediately showing the superiority of the commune is not only the ideological driving force for establishing the commune, but also the direct purpose of establishing a people's commune. Third, economic issues in the establishment of the commune must be handled with the communist spirit of "everyone for me, I for everyone," emphasizing putting politics in command, launching debates, mutual consultation, and everyone's satisfaction. Fourth, establishing and improving the township-commune system is the organizational basis for doing a good job in township-commune work. Changshou Township has implemented the method of integrating township and commune organizations, which is not only conducive to the development of township and commune work, but also effectively promotes the development of a high tide of production. Fifth, the commune establishment work must be based on the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, and break the "habit theory." Practice has proved that as long as the conditions for establishing a commune are ripe and the working methods are correct, because the masses' demands are urgent, it does not take a long time to build a people's commune.

### 公社一旦建立　生产鹏程万里  尚志县长寿乡建社二十天，工农业生产搞得轰轰烈烈

　　公社一旦建立　生产鹏程万里
    尚志县长寿乡建社二十天，工农业生产搞得轰轰烈烈
    本报哈尔滨29日电　黑龙江省尚志县长寿乡，7月下旬根据全面发展生产的需要和广大社员迫切要求，全乡二十三个农业社合并建成一个人民公社。
    这个人民公社现有三千七百五十五户，一万五千口人，耕地十一万八千多亩，内有水田二万三千多亩。这个社的自然条件是“六山一水三分田”，有矿藏，有草原，有河流，适于发展农业、工业、畜牧业、林业、渔业、手工业等多种生产。建立人民公社后这个乡实行了乡社合一，农业社、供销社、信用社合一，把工、农、商、学、兵结合成一体。这个乡建立人民公社虽然时间不久，但在推动当前生产和明年生产准备工作上已开始显示出无比的优越性。
    小社成了绊脚石
    建公社前，农业社在生产大跃进中遇到了一个共同的问题：跃进规划和小社的劳力物力不相适应。主要表现在四个方面：（1）社小劳力少，不能充分利用资源，对多种经营“干眼馋”搞不了，全乡二十三个社，只有十个社有牧场。万发社有方圆四十五里的一片浅山，山中有天然鱼池，适合发展畜牧业、园艺、养鱼等生产，就是因为社小，无力发展。可是成功社有三百多只羊，因为牧场太小，又不能再发展，只得实行“超过三百只就卖”的办法。（2）社多用水矛盾多，由于没有统一计划，各行其事，常常你放我堤，抵消力量。（3）社小力量小，遇事多从本社考虑，全乡长远基本建设没有力量搞。（4）社小影响土地合理利用和机耕作业。这些矛盾都说明，小社在农业生产大跃进的形势下已经不适应了。在去冬鸣放辩论时，就曾有社员提出并社意见。在今春的几次乡社干部会议上，社干部给乡领导贴大字报，要求并社，说：“再不并社就影响生产了！”社干部碰到一起，就酝酿串连并社，暗自挂钩。
    各农业社都有建立人民公社的要求，怎么办呢？乡党委召开小社党支部书记、主任会议进行研究，决定全乡建成一个人民公社，并成立了建社筹委会。
    工农业全面发展
    在党、团员和广大群众中开展建社问题的宣传教育和大鸣大放大辩论之后，广大干部和社员都兴高采烈，欢欣鼓舞，纷纷签名申请入社，普遍提出用搞好生产的实际行动迎接建社。一百六十户的万发社晚间打灯笼突击压绿肥，三天压肥五千七百吨，向公社报捷，作为献礼。
    建社一开始，就着手制订公社1959年生产规划，并在人民公社第一次代表大会上讨论与通过了规划草案。农业生产方面，粮食产量翻一番，每亩产粮一千斤；在工业生产方面，要办水晶石厂、草炭厂、砖厂等工厂，产值达三百二十八万七千元；畜牧业产值一百二十八万元，各方面生产总收入可达到一千万元左右。这样飞跃的发展简直是小社连想也不敢想的事。社员们在“今年七千五（每公顷产七千五百斤粮食），来年翻一番”、“让深山变成万宝山，浅山变成花果山，泡泉变成养鱼池，平地变成米粮川”的口号鼓舞下，干劲冲天，到8月中旬，全社已压绿肥三十三万八千吨，可供70％耕地面积施用，再大干十天，就能实现明年每亩施肥十吨的计划。为了实现水利化，建社后打出四百眼井，并抽出五百人在黑龙宫修水库，水利排灌系统也已开始整顿。现在社办的工业，大部分已开始筹建，草炭厂、乳粉厂等正在修建，砖厂、水晶石厂等已开工生产。公社建立二十天，就显示了这样巨大的优越性，更加鼓舞了干部和社员办好公社的信心和决心。
    怎样建立人民公社
    长寿乡建立人民公社的主要经验是：第一，充分搞好思想发动，通过大辩论，克服右倾保守思想，扫除资本主义、平均主义和本位主义思想障碍，这是搞好建社工作的一个关键。整个并社的过程就是和这些思想斗争的过程，只有明辨是非，破旧立新，才能鼓舞群众的生产和并社热情，才能保证建社工作又快又好地进行。第二，建立人民公社的过程，也是生产高潮的发展过程。长寿乡的经验证明，抓住公社的生产跃进规划，推动当前生产和明年生产准备，立即显示公社的优越性，不仅是建社的思想动力，也是建立人民公社的直接目的。第三，建社中的经济问题，必须以“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义精神来处理，强调政治挂帅，展开辩论，相互协商，大家满意。第四，建立和健全乡社体制，是搞好乡社工作的组织基础。长寿乡实行了乡社组织合一的办法，不仅有利于乡社工作的开展，也有力地促进了生产高潮的发展。第五，建社工作必须本着多快好省的精神，打破“习惯论”。实践证明，只要建社条件成熟，工作方法对头，因为群众要求迫切，并不需要费很长日子就可以建成人民公社。
