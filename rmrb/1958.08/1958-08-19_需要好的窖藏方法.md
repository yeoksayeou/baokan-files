　　Sweet potatoes must be utilized in many ways if there are more of them. But no matter how they are utilized, a large portion of the sweet potatoes will always need to be stored in cellars.
    Our country has a long history of planting sweet potatoes, and the planting area is very wide, so the experience of storing them in cellars is also very rich. We hope that readers of the newspaper can collect some truly effective methods and submit them to this newspaper for publication.
    When collecting, you must pay attention to the following points: First, the scope should be broad, including plains, mountains, low-lying areas, southern regions, and northern regions, so that it can meet the needs of various places; second, the storage capacity should be as large as possible, because small-scale storage methods are only suitable for the small-scale peasant economy era, but not suitable for today; third, the storage methods should be as simple, easy to implement, economical, and applicable as possible.

　　需要好的窖藏方法
    甘薯多了一定要多方面利用。但是不管怎样利用，总有很大一部分甘薯需要窖藏。
    我国种植甘薯有悠久的历史，种植面积很广，窖藏的经验因而也很丰富。我们希望报纸的读者能搜集一些真正行之有效的办法，寄交本报发表。
    搜集的时候，须要注意这样几点：第一，方面要广，平原的、山区的、洼地的、南方的、北方的都要，这样才能适应各地的需要；第二，贮藏量要尽可能的大，因为小量贮藏的办法只适于小农经济时代，而不适宜于今天；第三，贮藏的方法应当尽可能简便易行，经济适用。
