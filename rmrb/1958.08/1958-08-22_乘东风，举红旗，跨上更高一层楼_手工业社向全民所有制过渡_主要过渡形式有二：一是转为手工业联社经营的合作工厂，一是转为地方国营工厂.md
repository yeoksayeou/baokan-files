Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives recently convened a national conference of directors of handicraft federations from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, focusing on the development direction of the socialist transformation of handicrafts—gradually transitioning to ownership by the whole people. Deng Jie, Acting Director of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, delivered a concluding speech on this issue. He pointed out that in order to adapt to the current leaping forward situation, under the principles of state need, benefit to production, voluntary participation by members, and approval by the Party committee, the majority of handicraft cooperatives can be transformed into cooperative factories managed by a handicraft federation of a region or into local state-owned factories; some scattered and sporadic manufacturing or service cooperatives and sideline arts and crafts cooperatives, when it is inappropriate or unnecessary to transition, should continue to retain the original form of handicraft cooperatives.

The conference analyzed that since last winter and spring, many regions across the country have transformed their handicraft cooperatives into cooperative factories or directly transitioned to local state-owned factories. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of June, more than 9,300 have been transformed into cooperative factories, with more than 617,000 employees; more than 3,100 have directly transitioned to local state-owned factories, with more than 180,000 employees. The industries that have transitioned are mostly those directly related to industrial and agricultural production, such as metal products, electrical machinery manufacturing, iron and wood farm tools, mining and smelting, automobile and ship repair, and chemical raw materials. In many regions, the number of factories transformed is large, the speed is fast, and the enthusiasm is high, forming a mass upsurge. These situations show that the socialist transformation of China's handicrafts has entered a new stage of transitioning to ownership by the whole people.

The conference believes that the handicraft cooperatives organized in recent years have seen a gradual increase in labor productivity. After the rectification campaign and the "double-anti" movement, a new leaping forward situation has emerged, which shows that the relations of production in handicrafts are basically adapted to the productive forces. However, in the situation of building socialism at high speed, the requirements for overall planning and unified arrangements are becoming increasingly urgent and enhanced. If handicraft cooperatives remain in the old form of collective ownership, certain uncoordinated phenomena will arise between the two ownership systems, causing many difficulties for the state in unified arrangements and leadership management in terms of supply, production, and sales. Under this new situation, handicraft cooperatives must timely and gradually transition to ownership by the whole people.

The conference believes that there are various forms of transition to ownership by the whole people, mainly two: one is to transform into cooperative factories managed by a handicraft federation of a region or an industry, and the other is to directly transition to local state-owned factories. Local state-owned factories are owned by the whole people, and cooperative factories are also essentially enterprises owned by the whole people, because from its internal relations, the cooperative factory has returned the shares of the members after the transformation, abolished the labor dividends, and completely changed to a wage system. The relationship between the members and the means of production has been separated, and the relations of production of collective ownership have been basically changed; from the relationship with the state, the cooperative factories and state-owned factories are also basically the same. The only slight difference is that in the distribution of profits, cooperative factories can retain the method of paying income tax. In addition to paying taxes, the profits are unified and adjusted by the federation, thus preserving a certain component of collective ownership. However, after the decentralization of the handicraft system, the handicraft federations in many regions have merged with the industrial departments, and the raw materials, equipment, funds, technical force, labor force, etc., of the handicraft cooperative factories are uniformly arranged and adjusted under the leadership of the local Party and government. Under this situation, the characteristics of collective ownership are also not very significant.

The conference pointed out that as long as the transition of handicraft cooperatives to ownership by the whole people is beneficial to the development of production, it is better to be faster than slower, otherwise it will lag behind the needs of the situation and the requirements of the masses. However, due to the uneven industrial development in various regions and the different foundations of handicraft cooperatives, there is no need to force uniformity in the forms and steps of the transition. In some regions, the industrial base is weak and the proportion of handicrafts is large. The local Party and government leadership urgently needs to develop local industries on the basis of handicrafts, and many handicraft cooperatives can directly be transformed into local state-owned factories; in some regions, the industry has a foundation, and handicrafts are also relatively developed. The state does not urgently need handicrafts, or cannot manage them for the time being. In this case, many cooperatives can be transformed into cooperative factories, and a few cooperatives can also transition to local state-owned factories when necessary; in some regions, the industry is developed, the proportion of handicrafts is very small, and large state-owned industries can drive handicrafts, or many handicraft cooperatives can be directly transformed into local state-owned factories.

The conference requested that all regions should strive to be active and prudent in carrying out factory transformation work, and achieve fast but not chaotic, and be bold but also cautious. Before the factory transformation, under the leadership of the local Party and government, it is necessary to conduct investigations and assessments, combine them with the needs of the country, classify and rank them by industry and cooperative, and make overall plans for the speed, form, method, production direction, economic reorganization, investment and expansion after the factory transformation. In terms of control, industries that the country urgently needs to develop, such as machinery, electricity, iron, wood, metallurgy, and chemicals, should be transformed first; cooperatives with large profits, high accumulation, and a high degree of mechanization should also be transformed first. It is necessary to be good at distinguishing the order of importance, urgency, and slowness, and proceed in batches and phases. Do not "grab everything at once" and transform too much at once. In the factory transformation, it is necessary to implement political command, let go and mobilize the masses, establish a correct understanding of factory transformation among the members through airing views, debates, and overcome the incorrect ideas of a few members who may have a dependence on the state and demand overly high wages and benefits.

The conference finally pointed out that whether or not double leaps forward in production and thought can be achieved is a sign of whether the factory transformation work is done well. Therefore, the factory transformation work should not only not affect production, but also use it as a driving force to further promote the development of production. It should call on the vast number of members to welcome the factory transformation with practical actions and organize a greater leap forward in production.

　　乘东风，举红旗，跨上更高一层楼
    手工业社向全民所有制过渡
    主要过渡形式有二：一是转为手工业联社经营的合作工厂，一是转为地方国营工厂
    据新华社21日讯  中华全国手工业合作总社最近召开全国各省、市、自治区手工业联社主任会议，集中地研究了手工业社会主义改造的发展方向——逐步向全民所有制过渡问题。全国手工业合作总社代主任邓洁就这个问题作了总结发言。他指出，为适应目前的跃进形势，在国家需要，对生产有利，社员自愿，党委批准的原则下，多数手工业合作社可以分别转为地方国营或合作工厂；部分分散零星的制造性或服务性合作社和副业性的工艺美术合作社，在不适宜或没有必要过渡的时候，应该继续保留原有手工业合作社的形式。
    会议分析去冬今春以来，全国有不少地区的手工业合作社转变为合作工厂或者直接过渡为地方国营工厂，截至6月底的不完全统计，转为合作工厂的已有九千三百多个，职工六十一万七千多人；直接过渡为地方国营工厂的有三千一百多个，职工十八万多人。转厂的行业大部分是与工农业生产直接有关系的金属制品、电机制造、铁木农具、采矿冶炼、汽车船舶修理、化工原料等行业，不少地区转厂的数量大、速度快、劲头足，形成了群众性的热潮。这些情况表明我国手工业的社会主义改造已进入一个向全民所有制过渡的新阶段。
    会议认为，几年来组织起来的手工业合作社，劳动生产率逐年有所提高，经过整风和“双反”运动，又出现了新的跃进局面，这就说明手工业的生产关系和生产力基本上是相适应的。但是在高速度建设社会主义的情况下，全面规划，统一安排的要求日益迫切和增强，手工业合作社如果仍然停留在原有集体所有制的旧形式，就会在两种所有制之间产生某些不协调现象，使国家在供、产、销的统一安排和领导管理等方面发生许多困难，在这种新形势下，手工业合作社必须适时地逐步地向全民所有制过渡。
    会议认为，向全民所有制过渡有多种多样的形式，主要是两种：一种是转为一个地区或一个行业手工业联社经营的合作工厂，另一种是直接过渡为地方国营工厂。地方国营工厂是全民所有制，合作工厂实质上也是全民所有制的企业，因为从它的内部关系看，转厂后退还了社员的股金，取消了劳动分红，完全改变为工资制，社员和生产资料的关系已经脱离，集体所有制的生产关系基本上已经改变；从对国家的关系上看，合作工厂和国营工厂也是基本相同的，稍有不同的地方，就是在利润分配上，合作工厂可以保存缴纳所得税的办法，除交税外，利润归联社统一调剂，这样就保存了一定的集体所有制的成分。但是在手工业体制下放后，不少地区的手工业联社已经和工业部门合并，手工业合作工厂的原料、设备、资金、技术力量、劳动力等等都在当地党、政领导下实行统一安排和调剂，在这种情况下，集体所有制的特点也很不显著了。
    会议指出，手工业合作社向全民所有制过渡，只要对发展生产有利，速度快一点比慢一点好，否则就会落后于形势需要，落后于群众要求。但是由于各地工业发展不平衡，手工业合作社的基础不同，过渡的形式和步骤不必强求一致。有的地区工业基础薄弱，手工业比重大，当地党政领导上迫切需要在手工业的基础上发展地方工业，许多手工业社就可以直接转为地方国营工厂；有的地区工业有基础，手工业也比较发达，国家对手工业并不迫切需要，或者一时还管不起来，在这种情况下，许多合作社可以转为合作工厂，必要时少数合作社也可以过渡为地方国营工厂；还有些地区工业发达，手工业比重很小，国营大工业可以带动手工业，也可以把许多手工业社直接转为地方国营工厂。
    会议要求各地在进行转厂工作时应该力求积极稳妥，做到快而不乱，既要大胆，又要慎重。在转厂之前，要在当地党政的领导下，经过调查摸底，结合国家的需要，按行业、按合作社进行分类排队，对转厂的速度、形式、方法，转厂后的生产方向、经济改组、投资扩建等方面作出全面规划。在掌握上，机、电、铁、木、冶金、化工等国家迫切需要发展的行业，应该先转；利润大、积累多、机械化程度较高的合作社，也应该先转。要善于分别先后缓急，分批分期进行，不要“眉毛胡子一把抓”，一下子转得过多。在转厂中必须实行政治挂帅，放手发动群众，通过鸣放辩论，树立社员对转厂的正确认识，克服少数社员可能产生的依赖国家、要求过高的工资福利等不正确的思想。
    会议最后指出，能否做到生产、思想双跃进是衡量转厂工作做得好坏的标志，因此转厂工作不仅不能影响生产，而且要以此为动力，进一步推动生产的发展，应该号召广大社员以实际行动迎接转厂，组织生产的更大跃进。
