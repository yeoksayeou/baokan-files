Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The Nobusuke Kishi government, harboring latent imperialist ambitions, is intensifying its execution of a sinister plan to follow the United States in expanding armaments, preparing for war, and reviving Japanese militarism, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people.

The Japanese "Ground Self-Defense Force" established a missile unit on August 1st. It will be responsible for researching and testing "Nike" missiles and will also serve as the core of future Japanese missile forces.

According to sources close to the Japanese "Defense Agency," the "Defense Agency" also plans to send thirty to forty officers from the "Ground Self-Defense Force" to the U.S. "Nike" missile training center for training in order to equip the Japanese army with missiles. The United States has agreed to this plan. At the same time, Japan will soon formally request the United States to supply "Nike" missiles.

These sources said that this means the "Ground Self-Defense Force" is ready to ultimately use "Nike" missiles as its combat weapons. They particularly emphasized the "significance" of the current visit to Japan by Nat Paschall, vice president of the American Douglas Aircraft Company. The "Nike" missile is manufactured by this company.

On July 31, the Kishida Nobusuke government's Ministry of Education announced a draft plan to implement militarist education. This plan stipulates that the current teaching curriculum for Japanese primary and secondary schools should be revised. The revised curriculum will focus on so-called "moral education," geography, and history, and the "Kimi ga Yo" (meaning "a prosperous age under the Emperor's reign") national anthem, which praises the reign of the Japanese Emperor, will be taught in elementary schools.

This reactionary measure of the Kishida Nobusuke government has aroused the angry opposition of the Japanese people. The Japan Teachers Union has passed a resolution to launch a resolute struggle against the Kishida Nobusuke government.

At the same time, the Kishida Nobusuke government is stepping up its collusion with the United States to further tie Japan to the American war chariot.

Disregarding the long-standing strong opposition of the Japanese people, the Kishida Nobusuke government recently conspired to forcibly requisition land from residents of Sunagawa Town to expand the U.S. military's Tachikawa Air Base.

Because Miyazaki, the mayor of Sunagawa Town, refused to issue a notice of forced requisition of residents' land, Yasui, the governor of Tokyo, actually filed a lawsuit against him.

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama told reporters after a cabinet meeting on August 1 that he had decided to depart for the United States on September 3 for a visit and would hold talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in Washington.

Fujiyama also said that a Japan-U.S. Security Committee meeting would be held before his visit to the United States. U.S. Air Force Major General Burns, who will take over as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces in Japan, is expected to arrive in Tokyo on the 12th and participate in the meeting.

    向美国要导弹装备日本军队
    岸政府帝国主义野心充分暴露
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：具有潜在帝国主义野心的岸信介政府，不顾日本人民的强烈反对，正在加紧执行追随美国扩军备战和使日本军国主义复活的罪恶计划。
    日本“陆上自卫队”在8月1日成立了一个导弹队，它将负责研究和试验“奈克式”导弹，同时它也将是未来的日本导弹部队的核心。
    据接近日本“防卫厅”的人士透露，为了用导弹来装备日本军队，“防卫厅”还计划派遣三十名到四十名“陆上自卫队”的军官到美国的“奈克式”导弹训练中心去受训，美国已经同意了这项计划。同时，日本不久就要正式要求美国供给“奈克式”导弹。
    这些人士说，这意味着“陆上自卫队”已经准备好最后用“奈克式”导弹做为它的作战武器。他们特别强调了美国道格拉斯飞机公司副总经理纳特·帕斯克耳目前访问日本的“意义”。“奈克式”导弹就是这家公司制造的。
    岸信介政府文部省在7月31日公布了实施军国主义教育的计划草案，这项计划规定要修改日本中小学现行的教学课程，修改后的课程将侧重所谓“道德教育”、地理和历史，并且要在小学中教唱颂扬日本天皇统治的“君代”（意为“天皇统治下面的盛世”）国歌。
    岸信介政府这一反动措施，引起了日本人民的愤怒反对，日本教职员工会已经通过决议，要对岸信介政府展开坚决斗争。
    与此同时，岸信介政府还加紧同美国勾结，进一步把日本缚在美国战车上。
    岸信介政府不顾日本人民长期以来的强烈反对，最近又阴谋强迫征用砂川町居民的土地来扩大美军立川空军基地。
    由于砂川町町长宫崎拒绝发出强征居民土地的告示，东京都知事安井竟然对他提起诉讼。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎1日在内阁会议后对新闻记者说，他决定在9月3日启程去美国访问，并且将在华盛顿同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行会谈。
    藤山还说，在他访问美国之前要召开一次日美安全委员会会议。将接任驻日美军总司令的美国空军少将伯恩斯可能在12日到达东京，并且参加这次会议。
