Jilin Drought Basically Relieved

    (Our dispatch) From July 29 to August 9, the Baicheng, Tonghua, and Gongzhuling Yanbian areas of Jilin Province successively experienced rainfall; thus, the drought that had lasted for more than a month has been basically relieved.
    Currently, in addition to a small number of townships and communes where the rain has not fully penetrated that are continuing to fight the drought, the province's more than five million drought-fighting troops have successively shifted to launching a concentrated effort to incorporate green manure into the soil, while also carrying out basic construction for year-round manure accumulation, in order to prepare for next year's great production.

　　吉林旱象基本解除
    本报讯　7月29日至8月9日，吉林省白城、通化、公主岭延边地区陆续降雨；至此，持续一个多月的旱象已经基本解除。
    目前，除少数未下透雨的乡社继续抗旱外，全省五百多万抗旱大军已陆续转入突击压绿肥，同时开展常年积肥的基本建设，为明年大生产作好准备。（李树功）
