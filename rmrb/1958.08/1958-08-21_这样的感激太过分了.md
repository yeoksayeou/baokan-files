　　Such Gratitude is Excessive
    In the Great Leap Forward in production, our institute and the Second Design Institute often completed design tasks ahead of schedule or exceeded quotas, powerfully supporting local industry. Some units, in order to express their gratitude to us, actually spent a lot of money to buy all kinds of gifts to send.
    The Kaifeng Municipal People's Committee entrusted us with the design of the Chemical Machinery Factory project on July 25th, requiring the drawings to be submitted in September; however, on August 1st, they used a train to transport three thousand jin of watermelons to our two design institutes. Recently, the Hangzhou Universal Machinery Factory sent the Second Design Institute an extra-large brocade banner, six chi long and four chi wide, with a red velvet base, estimated to be worth over a hundred yuan.
    We believe that the gratitude of construction units to design departments can be expressed in ways that conform to the principle of thrift and are more educational. For example, write a letter, in which you talk about the situation of local industries blooming everywhere, the role played by the design department in supporting local industry, and the enthusiasm of the comrades in the factory, and so on. Wouldn't this be both economical and more positively meaningful to encourage each other in this way?
    Yang Baoyu, Li Guang, and five others from the Ninth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry

### 这样的感激太过分了

　　这样的感激太过分了
    在生产大跃进中，我院和第二设计院经常提前或超额完成设计任务，有力地支援了地方工业。有的单位为了对我们表示感谢，竟花很多钱买各种各样的礼物送来。
    开封市人民委员会在7月25日委托我们设计化工机械厂的工程，要9月份交图；可是，他们在8月1日就用火车给我们两个设计院运来三千斤西瓜。最近，杭州通用机器厂送给第二设计院一面特大锦旗，长六尺、宽四尺，以红色丝绒做底，估计价值百元以上。
    我们认为，建设单位对设计部门的感谢，可以用符合节约原则和更有教育意义的方式来表达。例如，写封信，在信中讲一下地方工业遍地开花的情况，设计部门支援地方工业所起的作用，以及工厂同志们的干劲，等等。这样来相互勉励，不是既经济，又更有积极意义吗？
