The factory is poor, but the spirit is not: Small factories accomplish great things
Beijing People's Representatives Report on the Miracles Created by Small Factories

　　This newspaper reports that many small and poor factories in the capital are shining brightly in the Great Leap Forward. At the plenary session of the First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which continued yesterday (15th), representatives and observers from these factories reported on the hard work and dedication of their units' employees and the brilliant achievements they had made. It reminds people that the employees of these factories, commonly known as small and poor factories, are the most revolutionary. Once they are ideologically liberated and take serious action to do great and practical work, they will produce miracles that people could not have imagined in the past.

　　"Poverty leads to change" is a common characteristic of the Great Leap Forward in many small and poor factories. When the Xisi Chemical Factory was established in 1956, old iron troughs and large iron pots were the factory's main equipment. There was only one technician, and the production of caustic soda was just enough to cover costs. No one wanted calcium carbonate. Li Hanmin, the vice chairman of the factory's trade union, said at the meeting: "All our employees are unwilling to lag behind and are determined to find a way out." In the beginning, they tried to use electrolysis of salt to produce bleach for more than two months, but not only did they not succeed, but there were also accidents. However, the workers were not intimidated by the failures, and continued to fight hard. Later, they produced a more advanced product – metallic sodium, with a purity of 99.9%, exceeding the Japanese first-class reagent standard. The daily output also increased from a few grams to the current sixty kilograms, and the cost was reduced from 140 yuan per kilogram to eight yuan. In the beginning, there was no factory building, so they operated in the open air, and continued production in the snow wearing raincoats. Without a drying room, they used iron pots for stir-frying. After such hard work, the factory, which started from scratch, has now developed into a fairly large factory with an annual output value of 10 million yuan.

　　The factory is poor, but the spirit is not. When employees of small and poor factories seriously get down to work, they can accomplish great things. Chang Xuezeng, the director of the Motor Manufacturing Factory and an observer, said that the Motor Manufacturing Factory was formed by the merger of several handicraft production cooperatives, including electrical installation, machine repair, painting, binding, and writing brushes. Initially, the capital was only more than one hundred yuan, and the tools were only knives, pliers, and awls. However, the employees of this factory relied on their own efforts to overcome countless difficulties on the road to progress. Now, the factory not only has twenty-eight lathes and 900,000 yuan in capital, but also its product quality has reached national standards, and it is listed as one of the five national inspection-free factories alongside the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory. The Beijing Steel Factory, formerly a workshop of the Heating Material Factory, originally only produced some cast steel parts and processed some iron filings. Qi Guorui, the workshop director of this factory, said that during the Great Leap Forward, all the employees of the factory promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and worked hard for three months, designing, constructing, installing, and producing at the same time, turning the factory into a steel plant with an annual output of 200,000 tons of steel.

　　Employees of small and poor factories are also vanguards in the technological revolution. Leng Lin, the director of the Beijing Chemical Factory, reported on the factory's development from the original fourteen people, a dozen broken houses, and some glass bottles, enamel cans, and other equipment to more than 4,000 people, with a large number of products being exported. He said: "A poem with lofty aspirations is circulating among the workers in our factory: 'If raw materials are lacking, find them yourself; if equipment is lacking, make it yourself; if conditions are poor, have high aspirations; combine foreign and local methods to refine treasures.'" Because the factory did not have a centrifuge, the workers put the raw materials in flour sacks and pressed them with sticks using water; without a steam heat source, they used honeycomb briquette stoves instead. The workers overcame various difficulties in this way and created miracles. In the past, we always thought that our products were not as good as foreign ones, but recently a famous chemical factory in West Germany with a history of 131 years – Immerke Factory – came to our factory to order goods. Now, the factory, whose products are sold to factories in ten countries, has put forward a great goal of marching towards the chemical industry: increasing the number of reagent products to 2,000 and reaching international standards one and a half years ahead of schedule. Zong Chongren, the vice director of the Xidan Metal Repair Factory, said that the production process of this factory was almost entirely manual in the past few years, but now the workers are making machines themselves. Zong Chongren said in the report that when they first tried to make an edge rolling machine based on the principle of a rolling mill, the workers had a low level of education and could not design or draw drawings. They worked for six days and nights and made an edge rolling machine that did not go straight. Some people's morale dropped. After the strong support of the leadership, they invited veteran technicians to hold a "Zhuge Liang meeting," researched and modified it eight times on the spot, and finally succeeded. Everyone jumped up with joy and said: "If an edge rolling machine with a production efficiency increased by 24 times can be made, other tools can definitely be made." The worker Gao Yinhao was not very literate, had a disabled eye, and was also deaf, but he drew twelve drawings. The electric circular wheel iron cutting machine, which was successfully trial-produced not long ago, increased efficiency by 85 times compared with manual operation. The work that four technicians could not complete in a year in the past can now be completed by an ordinary worker with a machine in one month.

　　However, the great transformation of small and poor factories was not smooth sailing. They first encountered the stubborn resistance of various conservative ideas. Wang Jianzhi, the director of the Civil Lighting Factory, which had only nine belt lathes at the time of the joint venture, said: "The mass technological revolution is rapidly liberating our factory from backward manual operations. In the 50-day hard battle, the entire factory established forty-one mechanization combat teams, with leading cadres taking the lead and young, middle-aged, and old people all participating. As a result, 56 various machines and 79 larger special tools have been manufactured, and the degree of mechanization of the entire factory has jumped from 29% to 85%, basically realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization. However, when the slogan of 'realizing mechanization' was first put forward, a small number of employees, especially some technical cadres, did not think so. They argued that the only way to achieve mechanization was to 'seek assistance from the state.' They simply could not see the infinite wisdom of the broad masses of employees. When the workers made new machines, they did not welcome them, but stood by and pointed fingers to find fault with them. They said: "Let's talk about it after fifty days and see what kind of name you can make." They turned from "extenders" to "watchers." The Party branch resolutely criticized and fought against these promoters of backwardness, and insisted on the road of relying on the masses, working hard and self-reliantly, and finally gave the promoters of backwardness a powerful counterattack with undeniable facts.

　　The representatives welcomed these inspiring speeches with warm applause.

　　厂穷志不穷　小厂干大事
　　北京市人民代表汇报小厂创造的奇迹
    本报讯　首都的许多小厂、穷厂跃进中大放光彩。在昨天（15日）继续举行的北京市第三届人民代表大会第一次会议的全体大会上，这些工厂的代表和列席代表分别报告了本单位职工穷干苦干的经过和所获得的辉煌成就。它向人们提示：这些被人们通常称做小厂和穷厂的职工最富有革命性，它们在思想上一旦得到解放并在行动上认真地大干实干起来，就会产生出人们过去所不敢想像的奇迹。
    “穷则思变”，是许多小厂、穷厂跃进的共同特点。西四化工厂1956年建厂时，旧铁槽和大铁锅是这个厂的主要设备，技术人员只有一个，生产的烧碱刚够成本，碳酸钙没有人要。这个厂的工会副主席李汉民代表在会上说：我们全厂职工不甘落后，决心打开出路。最初两个多月试用电解食盐生产漂水，不仅没有成功，还出了事故。但是工人们没有被失败吓倒，继续苦战，以后又制成了更高级的产品——金属钠，它的纯度达到99.9％，超过了日本一级试剂标准，日产量也从几克增加到现在的六十公斤，成本从每公斤一百四十元降低到八元。开始时没有厂房，就露天操作，下雪穿雨衣继续生产；没有干燥室，就用铁锅来炒。经过这样的艰苦奋斗，现在，这个白手起家的工厂已经发展到年产值一千万元的具有相当规模的工厂了。
    厂穷志不穷，小厂、穷厂的职工认真实干起来，就能干出大事。电机制造厂厂长、列席代表常雪增说，电机制造厂是电器安装、机器修理、喷漆、装订、毛笔等几个手工业生产合作社社员合并组成的，最初资金只有一百多元，工具只有刀子、钳子和锥子三大件，但是这个厂的职工们依靠自己的努力，克服了前进道路上的无数困难。现在这个厂不仅拥有二十八台车床和九十万元资金，而且产品质量达到了国家标准，与国营沈阳变压器厂等并列为全国五个免试工厂之一。前身是暖气材料厂一个车间的北京钢厂，原先只生产一些铸钢件和加工一些铁末子，这个厂的车间主任齐国瑞说，在大跃进中，全厂职工发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，苦战三个月，边设计、边施工、边安装、边生产，把工厂变成了一个年产二十万吨钢的钢厂。
    小厂穷厂的职工在技术革命上也是急先锋。北京化工厂厂长冷林代表报告了这个厂从原来十四个人、十几间破房和一些玻璃瓶、搪瓷罐等设备发展到四千多人、产品大量出口的经过。他说：我们厂的工人中流传着这样一首壮志凌云的诗歌：“原料缺自己找，设备缺自己搞，条件差志气高，洋土结合炼出宝”。厂里没有离心机，工人们就用水把原料放在面袋内用棍子压；没有蒸气热源用蜂窝煤炉代替。工人们就这样克服了各种困难，创造出奇迹。过去，我们总以为自己的产品不如外国，可是最近西德的一个有一百三十一年历史的有名化工厂——伊默克厂向我们工厂来订货了。现在，这个产品行销十个国家的工厂又提出一个伟大的向化学工业进军的目标：试剂产品增加到两千种，提前一年半达到国际水平。宗崇仁代表是西单金属修配厂的副厂长，这个厂的生产过程过去几年几乎全部是手工操作，但是现在工人们都自己动手做机器。宗崇仁在报告中说，开始根据轧线机的原理试制轧边机时，工人文化水平低，不会设计，不会画图，赶了六昼夜，做出轧边机不走直线，有人情绪低落下来，经过领导的大力支持，请老技工开“诸葛亮会”，当场研究改了八次，终于成功，大家高兴得跳起来。都说：“生产效率提高二十四倍的轧边机能做出来，别的工具一定也能做出来”。工人高荫皓不大识字，一只眼残废了，耳朵也聋了，但他却画出了十二张图纸。不久前试制成功的电动圆轮切铁机比手工操作提高效率八十五倍，过去四个技工一年都做不完的活，现在一个普通工人用机器一个月就完成了。
    但是小厂、穷厂的大翻身并不是一帆风顺的，它们首先遇到了各种各样的保守思想的顽抗。合营时仅有九台皮带车床的民用灯具厂厂长王建志代表说：群众性的技术革命正迅速使我们厂摆脱了落后的手工操作。在五十天的苦战过程中，全厂成立了四十一个机械化战斗队，领导干部亲自挂帅，青壮老年一齐上阵，结果已制造了各种机器五十六台，较大的专用工具七十九件，全厂的机械化程度由29％一跃而为85％，基本上实现了机械化、半机械化。但是，当最初提出“实现机械化”的口号时，少数职工特别是某些技术干部却不以为然。他们主张要是实现机械化，唯一的道路是“向国家求援”，他们根本看不见广大职工群众的无穷智慧。在工人们作出了新机器时，他们不是欢迎，而是站在旁边指手划脚地加以挑剔，他们说：“五十天以后再说吧，看看究竟能搞出个什么名堂来。”他们由“伸手派”而转为“观潮派”了。党支部对这些促退派给予了坚决的批判和斗争，并坚持了依靠群众穷干苦干自力更生的道路，终于以无可辩驳的事实，给了促退派以有力的反击。
    代表们以热烈的鼓掌来欢迎这些激动人心的发言。
