    Promoting Tool Improvement to a Semi-Mechanized Level:
    Large-Scale Production of Ball Bearings Across Regions
    Shandong
    According to the Dazhong Daily: As of July 28th, 249 county and township industrial units in 91 counties (cities) in Shandong Province have successfully trial-produced ball bearings, and some units have officially started production.
    Since the Shandong Provincial Party Committee put forward the requirement to install ball bearings on all rotating tools and major old farm tools before National Day, a movement to reform agricultural tools and improve water lifting and rotating tools—large-scale ball bearing implementation—is unfolding throughout the province. Counties under the Huimin, Changwei, Jining, Liaocheng, and Tai'an regions have all successfully trial-produced ball bearings, and some have begun production. In the Heze region, 6 of the 9 counties, including Dingtao, have 24 units capable of producing bearings and ball bearings. The entire region requires that every township establish a bearing factory, and every repair station or repair group produce ball bearings, aiming to achieve ball bearing implementation throughout the region by the end of August. The Linyi County Party Committee organized 26 factories and cooperatives in a joint large-scale collaboration, using local materials and local manufacturing, working hard for seven days and nights to manufacture 200 presses, 3.8 million ball bearings, and 80,000 sets of bearings and bearing blocks, enabling all double-wheeled double-furrow plows, double-wheeled single-furrow plows, wooden wheelbarrows, waterwheels, and all sowing tools with pulleys to be fully equipped with ball bearings. Xintai County initially plans to produce 35,000 sets of bearings in August. In addition to completely renovating all existing rotating tools in the county, it can spare more than 8,000 sets to support other areas. The Tai'an County Party Committee also proposed to achieve ball bearing implementation for all rotating tools in the county within one month.
    Many facts prove that installing ball bearings on old farm tools can reduce labor intensity, save labor, and greatly improve labor efficiency. After the Gaotang Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory produced ball bearings using indigenous methods in April, 20 townships in the county also built bearing factories, using indigenous methods to produce low-speed ball bearings. Currently, more than 13,000 agricultural tools in the county have been fitted with ball bearings, increasing labor efficiency by one to two times or more, and the county's labor shortage problem can be basically solved. As of July 21st, Tai'an County had eight units producing more than 500 sets of bearings, which were installed on waterwheels, farm tools, and transportation equipment. The county's wooden wheelbarrows, pushed and pulled, required two people to travel 50 li a day. After installing bearings, one person pushing the same weight could travel more than 100 li a day.
    Producing ball bearings was something that workers in some small factories dared not imagine in the past. However, in fact, as long as they can adhere to the principle of "indigenous methods first" and have the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, the manufacture of bearings is not mysterious or difficult. Zhang Xiangcheng, a worker at the Ju County Machinery Manufacturing Factory, saw the tool for manually pressing ball bearings in Gaotang at the provincial on-site conference on agricultural tools and fertilizers. After liberating his mind, he returned to the factory and found materials from recycled scrap iron to modify and create two small manual presses, which allowed one person to press more than 2,000 ball bearings a day. Workers Zhu Yian, Zhang Xiangcheng, and others, after two days of effort, made a set of tools for producing complete ball bearings and produced three types of bearings: 1.5 cm, 2 cm, and 2.5 cm, which can be used for various waterwheels, wooden wheelbarrows, treadmills, etc.
    Currently, all parts of the province are simultaneously trial-producing ball bearings, rushing to manufacture tools for making bearings, and holding on-site meetings to disseminate technology in order to push the ball bearing implementation movement to a climax.
    Hebei
    This newspaper reports that a high tide of agricultural tool reform centered on the manufacture of ball bearings has been launched in counties and cities in Hebei Province. Recently, more than 50 counties, including Xingtang, Shulu, Xushui, and Shangdu, have produced ball bearings and bearings using indigenous methods after several days of hard work. They reported the good news of their successful prototypes to the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. The slogan put forward by various regions is: "Secretaries take the lead, break superstitions, work hard for sixty days, achieve county-level, town-level, and township-level factories, and realize the ball bearing implementation of all rotating tools before National Day." In mid-July, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee instructed all regions to learn from the pioneering spirit of Fuyang Region in Anhui and Jun County in Henan in vigorously producing ball bearings, organize the production of ball bearings to reform agricultural tools, and rapidly achieve agricultural semi-mechanization.
    After receiving the instructions, the counties immediately took action. Many county party committees convened emergency meetings of the party committees of various townships and agricultural tool repair factories and stations to make arrangements and worked with workers to study the trial production of ball bearings. The Baoding Regional Party Committee organized more than 20 county party committee secretaries and iron and wood workers to study in Jun County, Henan. Agricultural tool repair factories and stations in Xushui County worked hard for two days and nights. By the evening of July 23rd, 13 repair factories and stations had produced five types of ball bearings using small hammers and steel files. Now, it is being promoted in all factories and stations in the county and is being rushed to produce day and night. Zhuo County built two ball bearing plants in one day and immediately put them into production. Some bicycle repair workers in Xingtai City, who had never seen the production process of ball bearings, after collective research for one day and night, finally successfully trial-produced ball bearings manually, which were not inferior to the Lion brand ball bearings in Tianjin. Then, they further studied and improved, and in just five days, they achieved machine production, and the daily output increased from 15,000 to 100,000.
    In order to support the early realization of ball bearing implementation in rural areas, Tianjin's commercial departments decided to supply each county with a set of machines for producing ball bearings, so that each county can use machines to replace manual production. At present, commercial department affiliated factories are fully rushing to manufacture pounding machines and polishing machines to ensure that they are supplied to each county before August 10th. Baoding City also drew the production and manufacturing process of ball bearings into drawings and distributed them to various counties to help them produce.
    Sichuan
    This newspaper reports that Sichuan Province is vigorously developing an agricultural tool reform movement with the main goals of vehicle and animal power for transportation, ball bearing implementation for transportation tools, mechanization of grain threshing, mechanization of tuber processing, and improvement of basic construction tools.
    After successively reversing the tendency to emphasize creation and de-emphasize promotion, in order to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural tool reform movement, the province, regions, counties, and townships have generally established agricultural tool reform committees to promptly solve problems in the creation, production, and promotion of agricultural tools. Relying on the broad masses, the agricultural tool reform is closely integrated with the current production needs and is rapidly developing. The Nanchong Region, which has developed the movement faster, has promoted 2.1 million improved agricultural tools, averaging nearly two per household. Xichong County, which achieved vehicle transportation in the entire county in ten days, mobilized 100,000 people to rush to repair 10,000 li of rural roads in ten days, with more than 20,000 various vehicles. Because vehicle transportation quickly replaced carrying by shoulders and backs, 1.6 million labor days were saved in summer manure and grain transportation alone. Luzhou Region adopted indigenous methods to manufacture ball bearings, and more than 100,000 waterwheels in the region have been equipped with ball bearings and flywheels, increasing efficiency by three times. In order to support the autumn harvest and autumn planting, Suining Region promoted 150,000 improved agricultural tools such as threshing machines and rice root presses in half a month, many of which were equipped with ball bearing equipment. The threshing machine manufactured by the Nanxi Township Handicraft Cooperative, after adding ball bearing sleeves and other parts, can be used for threshing, slicing, shredding, threshing, and chaff cutting.
    In order to adapt to the needs of agricultural semi-mechanization, many places have reorganized and adjusted the local machinery industry. In addition to building 17 new machinery factories, Nanchong Region has recently concentrated the small iron and wood factories scattered in various places and built 621 iron and wood joint factories in townships. Each factory has workshops for casting, fitting, red furnace, and woodworking. With the concentration of technical forces and equipment, many agricultural tools that could not be manufactured in the past have been manufactured recently. The Nanchong Upstream Iron Factory manufactured punches, and by October, it can produce 600,000 pairs of ball bearings. The ball bearing factory established in Neijiang City is rushing to manufacture 150,000 sets of ball bearings to equip waterwheels, cotton gins, threshing machines, and improved vehicles.
    In order to solve the difficulty of agricultural tool materials, a mass movement to donate iron, steel, copper, and wood has been launched in various places, mobilizing scattered folk materials to participate in socialist construction. Combining the discussion of agricultural tool reform, southern, Anyue, Nanchong, and other ten counties mobilized the masses to donate iron and copper, and in a few days, they donated more than 1,200 tons of various steel materials, which initially solved the urgent need for steel in the manufacture of agricultural tools, transportation, and tools. Many agricultural cooperatives also used scrap iron and scrap steel as basic construction investment and handed them over to county and township agricultural tool factories in exchange for various improved agricultural tools and improved tools.
    (Ji Xichen) Jiangsu
    This newspaper reports that Jiangsu Province has decided to basically achieve agricultural semi-mechanization this year. This was discussed and decided at a telephone conference recently held by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee with the participation of the party secretaries of various regions and cities in the province.
    Jiang Weiqing, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, presided over the conference. At the conference, he gave instructions on the current agricultural tool reform work. Comrade Jiang Weiqing said: In order to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward and a greater leap forward next year, the province must immediately launch a movement to promote and improve agricultural tools, and basically achieve agricultural semi-mechanization within this year. That is to replace all old-fashioned agricultural tools with improved agricultural tools and implement ball bearing implementation for all tools that can be fitted with ball bearings. Installing ball bearings on improved tools can increase efficiency by one to several times. The ball bearings required for agricultural semi-mechanization are elementary and do not require speeds of several thousand revolutions per minute; and elementary ball bearings can be manufactured by factories, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives.
    Comrade Jiang Weiqing requested that all regions make significant achievements in agricultural tool reform in August and September, and requested that all towns and cities play a significant role in supporting agricultural semi-mechanization.
    The party secretaries of various regions and cities expressed at the meeting: We will resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, immediately launch a high tide of promoting and improving agricultural tools, and basically achieve agricultural semi-mechanization within this year.

    把改良工具推上半机械化的水平
    各地大造滚珠轴承
    山东
    据大众日报消息：截至7月28日统计：山东省已有九十一个县（市）的二百四十九个县、乡工业单位试制滚珠轴承成功，部分单位已正式投入生产。
    自从山东省委提出要在国庆节前，把一切运转工具和主要旧农具装上滚珠轴承的要求以后，一个改革农具和提水、运转工具的中心环节——大搞滚珠轴承化的运动正在全省范围内展开。惠民、昌潍、济宁、聊城、泰安等专区所属各县都已试制成功，部分投入生产。菏泽专区九个县，已有定陶等六个县的二十四个单位能够生产轴承和滚珠。全专区要求乡乡都要办起轴承厂，修配站或修配小组都要生产滚珠，8月底全区实现滚珠轴承化。临沂县委组织了二十六处厂、社联合大协作，以就地取材、就地制造，苦战七昼夜，制造二百部压力机、三百八十万粒滚珠和八万套轴承、轴挡，使全县所有双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、木轮车、水车和所有带轮的播种工具等全部实现滚珠轴承化。新泰县初步计划8月份生产轴承三万五千套，除将全县原有运转工具全部改完，还可剩余八千余套，支援外地。泰安县委也提出，要在一个月内全县实现所有运转工具滚珠轴承化。
    许多事实证明，旧农具安上滚珠轴承，就能减轻劳动强度，节省劳力，大大提高劳动效率。高唐农具机械制修厂4月间用土办法制出滚珠轴承后，接着全县二十个乡也都建起了轴承厂，用土法生产低速滚珠轴承。目前全县已有一万三千余件农具换上滚珠轴承，劳动效率提高一至二倍以上，全县劳力不足的问题可基本上解决。泰安县至7月21日已有八个单位生产出轴承五百余套，安装在水车、农具和运输工具上。该县的木轮车一推一拉，两个人一天走五十里路，装上轴承后，只一人推同样的重量，一天能走百余里。
    生产滚珠轴承，过去在一些小工厂里的职工们是不敢想的。但是，事实上只要能坚持贯彻“土法先上马”的方针和敢想、敢做的精神，轴承的制造并不神秘，也并不困难。莒县机械制造厂工人张相成在省农具、肥料现场会议上，看到了高唐用人工手搬压制滚珠工具后，思想大解放，回厂后从收购的废铁中找材料改制出两部人工小压力机，一人一天能压制滚珠二千余粒；工人朱宜安、张相成等，又经过了两天的努力，制成了生产全套滚珠轴承的工具，并制成了一点五公分、二公分、二点五公分三种轴承，可以分别用于各式水车、木轮车、脚踏磨等。
    现全省各地正在一面试制滚珠轴承，一面赶制制造轴承的工具及召开现场会议，传播技术，以便把轴承化运动推向高潮。
    河北
    本报讯　河北省各县、市掀起了一个以制造滚珠轴承为中心的农具改革高潮。最近，行唐、束鹿、徐水、商都等五十多个县经过苦战数日，已用土办法制出滚珠和轴承。并把试制成功的样品向中共河北省委报喜。各地提出的口号是：书记挂帅，破除迷信，苦战六十天，达到县县、镇镇、乡乡办工厂，在国庆节前实现一切运转工具滚珠轴承化。中共河北省委在7月中旬指示各地学习安徽阜阳专区和河南浚县大搞滚珠轴承生产的独创精神，组织生产滚珠轴承改革农具，迅速实现农业半机械化。
    各县接到指示后，立即行动起来，许多县委召集了各乡党委、农具修配厂、站的紧急会议作了布置，并和工人一道研究滚珠轴承的试制工作。中共保定地委组织各县县委书记和铁木工人共二十多人到河南浚县学习。徐水县各农具修配厂、站鏖战两昼夜，在7月23日晚已有十三个修配厂、站，用小锤和钢锉制出五种滚珠轴承，现已在全县各厂站推广，正日夜赶制。涿县一昼夜建成两个滚珠场，并立即投入生产。邢台市有些从来没有看见过滚珠的生产过程的修理自行车工人，经过集体钻研一昼夜，终于用手工试制成功了，不亚于天津狮球牌的滚珠。接着又进一步研究改进，在短短的五天内就实现了用机器生产，日产量由一万五千个提高到十万个。
    天津商业部门为了支援农村早日实现滚珠轴承化，决定供应每县一套生产滚珠轴承的机器，使各县用机器代替手工生产。目前，商业部门附属工厂正全力赶制捣机和磨光机，保证在8月10日前供应给各县。保定市还把滚珠轴承的生产制造过程绘成图纸，分送给各县，以帮助各县生产。
    四川
    本报讯　四川省以运输车子化畜力化、运输工具滚珠轴承化、谷物脱粒机化、薯类加工机械化、基本建设工具改良化为主要目标的农具改革运动，正在风起云涌的开展着。
    各地在相继扭转重创造、轻推广的偏向以后，为加强农具改革运动的领导，省专县乡普遍建立了农具改革委员会，及时解决农具创造、生产和推广中的问题，依靠广大群众，使农具改革紧密结合当前生产需要，迅速开展起来。运动发展较快的南充专区已推广改良农具二百一十万件，平均每户将近两件。十天实现了全县车子化的西充县，动员十万群众十天抢修乡村道路一万华里，各种车辆两万多部。由于车运迅速代替了肩挑人背，仅夏季运粪运粮中就节省了一百六十万劳动日。泸州专区采用土法制造滚珠，全区已有十万多部水车装备上了滚珠、飞轮，效率提高三倍。遂宁专区为支援秋收秋种，半月推广打谷机、压稻根器等改良农具十五万部，其中许多都加上了滚珠设备。南溪乡手工业联社制造的打谷机加上滚珠筒和其他零件以后可作打谷、切片、切丝、脱粒、铡草五用。
    为适应农具半机械化的需要，许多地方重新改组调整了地方机械工业力量。南充专区除新建十七个机械厂，最近还将分散各地的小型的铁木工厂，以乡为单位集中兴建了六百二十一个铁木业联合工厂，每个工厂都设有铸工、钳工、红炉、木工等车间。随着技术力量和设备的集中，许多过去所不能制造的农具，最近都制造出来了。南充上游铁工厂制造冲床以后，到10月可生产六十万副滚珠。内江市建立的滚珠轴承厂，赶制十五万套滚珠，装备水车、轧花机、打谷机和改良车辆。
    为解决农具材料困难，各地掀起群众性的献铁献钢献铜献木运动，动员民间闲散物资参加社会主义建设。南部、安岳、南充等十县，结合讨论农具改革，发动群众献铁献铜，几天就献出各种钢铁材料一千二百多吨，初步解决了制造农具、运输和工具中急需的钢铁困难。许多农业社并将废铁废钢作为基本建设投资，交给县乡农具厂，折换各种改良农具和改良工具。
                      （纪希晨）江苏
    本报讯　江苏省决定在今年基本实现农业半机械化。这是江苏省委在最近召开的省各地、市委书记参加的电话会议上，讨论和决定的。
    省委第一书记江渭清同志主持了这次会议，他在会上对当前的农具改革工作作了指示。江渭清同志说：为了实现今年的大跃进和明年更大的跃进，全省必须立即开展推广改良农具运动，今年内基本实现农业半机械化。这就是用改良农具全部代替旧式农具，把一切能够安装滚珠轴承的工具轴承化。改良工具装上滚珠轴承，效率就可以提高一倍到几倍。农业半机械化所需要的滚珠轴承是初级的，并不需要每分钟几千转速的；而初级的滚珠轴承，工厂、手工业社和农业社都可以设法制造。
    江渭清同志要求各地在8、9月在农具改革方面作出显著成绩，要求各市镇在支援农业半机械化中，发挥重大作用。
    各地、市委书记在会上发言表示：坚决执行中央和省委的指示，立即掀起一个推广改良农具的高潮，今年内基本实现农业半机械化。
