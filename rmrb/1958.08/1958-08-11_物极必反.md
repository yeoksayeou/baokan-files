　　Extremes Meet
　　Wang Zisong
　　When things develop to an extreme, they transform into their opposite. "Extremes meet" refers to this principle of dialectics: the result of the mutual struggle between contradictory opposites is that they will transform into each other under certain conditions.
　　In capitalist society, the more cruel the exploitation by the bourgeoisie, the more intense the resistance it provokes from the proletariat. The bourgeoisie will die, and capitalism will transform into its opposite—socialism. The more fiercely imperialism oppresses the colonies, the more violent the resistance of the colonial people, which further accelerates the demise of imperialism. The revolutions of the Chinese and Asian people have proven this principle, and the current situation in the Middle East also proves this principle. This is the inescapable fate of capitalism and imperialism: the more they struggle to survive, the more they must intensify oppression and exploitation; but the more they intensify oppression and exploitation, the more they accelerate their own demise. The deeper they sink, the closer they get to death. This is completely in line with the principle of "extremes meet." From the perspective of the proletariat and the colonial people, it is also the same: the more oppression they suffer, the more fiercely they resist, and the sooner the day will come when they achieve victory, escape oppression, and turn themselves around.
　　Ancient Chinese military experts had already understood this dialectical principle. "The Art of War" says: "Place them in a place of extinction, and then they will survive; trap them in a deadly place, and then they will live." It also made a specific explanation: "Put the troops in a place where there is nowhere to go, and they will not be defeated even in death; when everyone fights to the death, how can there be no victory?! When soldiers are deeply trapped in danger, they are not afraid; when there is nowhere to go, the army is consolidated; when they go deep into the enemy's country, the soldiers dare not be lax; when they have no choice, they will fight resolutely." (Using Guo Hua Ruo's translation. The original text is: "Throw them into a place where they cannot go, and they will not retreat even in death. If they die there they can do no more, the soldiers will do their best. If the soldiers are deeply trapped they will not fear, if they have nowhere to go they will be firm, if they enter deeply they are restrained, if they have no choice they will fight.") When Han Xin attacked Zhao, he formed a battle formation with his back to the river; when Xiang Yu defeated Qin, he broke his cauldrons and burned his huts. They all used this principle and achieved victory.
　　Understanding "extremes meet" makes it easier to understand the principle of being poor and blank, as Mao Zedong put it. "In addition to other characteristics, the most prominent characteristic of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. These seem like bad things, but in fact, they are good things." Poverty means being poor, and blank means being backward. The poorest and most backward people have the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm. This is, of course, a good thing, not a bad thing.
　　Our laboring people, mainly the broad masses of peasants, have suffered the most and been oppressed the most deeply for thousands of years, and their revolutionary enthusiasm is therefore the greatest. The history of more than two thousand years of feudal society is a history of continuous peasant revolutionary uprisings. Because the peasants were forced to a dead end, to survive, they could only be "forced to join Liangshan." In the revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party, the peasants have always been the working class's greatest allies; they have been the most resolute in the revolution, made the greatest sacrifices, and contributed the most. Why was the socialist cooperation of agriculture in our country able to be completed so quickly and smoothly? It is precisely because the peasants are poor, with only three mu of land per person, and in some places, less than one mu of land; and because they have no tractors, they are eager for cooperation. Some people originally doubted: without tractors, can cooperation be achieved? Facts show that it is precisely because there are no tractors that cooperation is needed more. Therefore, first, there is the correct leadership of the Party; second, the people of our country are poor, and their enthusiasm for socialist revolution and construction is particularly strong. Only in this way can we explain why we are able to see such an unprecedented situation of socialist Great Leap Forward today, and only in this way can we explain why the speed of socialist construction in our country can be faster and faster.
　　Blank is the same: the more backward we are in science and culture, the more urgent the demand for developing science and culture becomes. The laboring people directly engage in productive labor, and they are the most able to keenly feel the need to learn, create, and develop science and technology, so they learn not only quickly but also practically. It seems that intellectuals should have the most knowledge, but in fact, this is not the case. Recent facts have proven that the laboring people are the most knowledgeable. The laboring people engage in productive labor. The knowledge they gain is the most direct and the most real; unlike the knowledge of intellectuals, which comes from books and is indirect knowledge, and some of it is unreliable. Because much of the knowledge of intellectuals now comes from the bourgeoisie, and there is also much false knowledge and pseudo-science. Because the laboring people are blank, they have no such burdens. "Good to write the newest and most beautiful words, good to paint the newest and most beautiful pictures." Zhang Liancheng, Chang Fengyao, and other comrades from the Andong Machinery Factory, who had never seen a tractor before (some had only seen it in a movie), manufactured tractors with their own wisdom and hands. But electrical engineering professors and experts who have earned doctoral degrees in the United States and Britain cannot build the simplest electrical machinery. Does this not prove that "blank" is a good thing?
　　Understanding these principles should dispel superstitions, break down feelings of inferiority, and overcome conservative thinking. People with conservative thinking always feel that their conditions are poor, inferior to others, and can only lag behind. They should understand that "extremes meet." Poor conditions should not be a reason for being passive and conservative, but should become a driving force for progress. Poor conditions seem like a bad thing, but in fact, they are a good thing. Precisely because we are backward, we must compare ourselves with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, thereby transforming backwardness into advancement. There are many such examples in the newspapers every day. The People's Daily published on July 7th that Comrade Hu Lanying, a female worker at the Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, who was originally a backward "dance fanatic," has transformed into a "golden dragon soaring through the clouds." Workers from other shifts are coming to her machine to "study," and they have put forward the slogan "Compare with Lanying, learn from Lanying, and spur on to catch up with Lanying." This is truly "extremes meet."
                          ＊　＊　＊
　　Lao Tzu's saying "Misfortune is where fortune leans; fortune is where misfortune lurks" speaks of the principle of contradictory transformation and extremes meeting. However, when studying Mao Zedong's thought that bad things can turn into good things, some people use these two sentences to make sophistry: since bad things can turn into good things and good things can turn into bad things, then bad things are good things, and good things are bad things; and thereby draw the conclusion that the proletariat also has duality, and socialism is also a bad thing. This kind of sophistry is certainly not dialectics. Dialectics believes that contradictory transformation requires certain conditions. Opposing sides have the possibility of transforming into each other, but to make the possibility a reality, there must also be certain conditions. Mao Zedong said: "The result of the mutual struggle between contradictory opposites is that they transform into each other under certain conditions. Here, conditions are important. Without certain conditions, the struggling sides will not transform." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People")
　　But there are different conditions. The book "Huainanzi" tells the story of "Sai Weng losing his horse": Sai Weng losing his horse was originally a misfortune; later, the lost horse brought back a fine horse, and misfortune turned into fortune; his son broke his leg riding the horse, and fortune turned into misfortune; but because of this he became a cripple, and when war broke out, he was not drafted into the army, and misfortune turned into fortune again. The "extremes meet" discussed here also transforms under certain conditions. If he had not brought back a horse, if he had not broken his leg, if war had not broken out, the opposing sides would not have been able to transform. These things are the conditions. But these conditions are completely accidental for Sai Weng, so-called "luck." It may happen, or it may not happen; it may happen this way, or it may happen that way. Therefore, "Huainanzi" concludes that the transformation of misfortune and fortune is "immeasurable": people cannot predict whether these conditions will arise, so they can only obey the dictates of fate. This is a passive fatalism, and fatalism is certainly not revolutionary dialectics. Revolutionary dialectics must be able to grasp the inevitable laws of contradictory transformation; recognize the necessary conditions, and be able to actively grasp them, so that we are not slaves of fate, but masters of our own destiny.
　　The proletariat is willing to change its status and has revolutionary enthusiasm. This is a condition for being poor and blank to become a good thing. But if there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without correct leadership, it cannot be transformed. The repeated failures of peasant revolutions in the past were like this. It must be the close combination of the Party's correct leadership and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. In a situation like our country today, the more correct the Party's leadership, the more fully the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses can be brought into play, and the more that being poor and blank seems to be a good thing, not a bad thing. Only in this way can we complete the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom, and can people's subjective initiative be truly brought into play.
　　People's subjective initiative is a very important condition. Whether bad things turn into good things or good things turn into bad things, people's subjective initiative often plays a decisive role. Mao Zedong often warns us: "Modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one lag behind." This also speaks of the principle of "extremes meet." Units that have already been rated as advanced will become backward if they become proud and no longer seek progress. Therefore, we must be continuous revolutionaries, making further progress in progress, and the advanced must become even more advanced.
                  ＊　＊　＊
　　Now some advocates of "Content to be in the middle reaches" use "extremes meet" to make sophistry. They say: since things develop to the extreme, they will transform into their opposite; it can be seen that being too advanced will turn into being backward and will make mistakes. Therefore, striving to be in the upper reaches is not as good as being content to be in the middle reaches, so that you will not make mistakes and will not become backward.
　　This is certainly not dialectics. As just said above: good things turning into bad things and bad things turning into good things must have certain conditions; without certain conditions, the opposing sides will not transform into each other. Without arduous efforts, backwardness cannot turn into advancement; without making subjective mistakes, the advanced will not turn into the backward.
　　Does this mean that the advanced can remain forever unchanged, forever as advanced without transforming? Of course not. Dialectics is not circularism. Circularism believes that advancement and backwardness cycle repeatedly, staying in place. Dialectics is a view of development, believing that things are always developing forward. Units that have already been advanced, if they do not regress, cannot stay in place either. If it stays in place, the units that were originally more backward than it will definitely catch up with it and surpass it, and it will also change from advanced to backward. Therefore, units that have already been advanced must also compare themselves with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced if they want to avoid becoming backward. In this way, the advanced is not transforming towards the backward, but towards the more advanced. This is the dialectic of development. "Content to be in the middle reaches" will inevitably be relegated to the lower reaches and will inevitably become backward.

　　物极必反
　　汪子嵩
    事物发展到极端，就会转化成它的反面。“物极必反”指的也就是辩证法的这个道理：矛盾着的对立双方互相斗争的结果，在一定条件下会互相转化。
    在资本主义社会里，资产阶级的剥削越是残酷，引起无产阶级的反抗也越是强烈，资产阶级就会死亡，资本主义转化为它的反面——社会主义。帝国主义对殖民地压迫得越是凶狠，殖民地人民的反抗就越是猛烈，也就更加加速了帝国主义的灭亡。中国和亚洲各国人民的革命证明了这个道理，现在中东的局势也证明了这个道理。这是资本主义、帝国主义无可逃避的命运：它们越是想挣扎生存下去，就必须加紧压迫与剥削；但越是加紧压迫与剥削，也就越促使它们自身走向灭亡。越陷越深，越深就越接近死亡。这完全合乎“物极必反”的道理。而从无产阶级、殖民地人民方面来说，也是如此：所受压迫越凶，反抗越猛，取得胜利、摆脱压迫、翻身的日子也就越快来到。
    我国古代的军事专家早已懂得这个辩证法的道理。“孙子兵法”说过：“投之亡地然后存，陷之死地然后生。”还作了具体的解释：“把队伍投放在无处去的地方，死也不败北；万众拼死，那有不胜之理？！兵士既然深陷危险的境地，就不恐惧；无处去，军队就巩固；深入敌国，士兵就不敢散漫；迫不得已，就会坚决作战”。（用郭化若译文。原文是：“投之无所往，死且不北，死焉不得，士人尽力。兵士甚陷则不惧，无所往则固，入深则拘，不得已则斗。”）韩信攻赵，背水为阵；项羽破秦，破釜焚庐。都是用的这个道理，取得了胜利。
    了解“物极必反”，就容易懂得毛泽东同志所说的一穷二白的道理。“除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事”。穷是贫穷，白是落后，最贫穷、最落后，革命干劲也就最足。这当然是好事而不是坏事。
    我国的劳动人民，主要是广大的农民群众，几千年来受苦最多，受压迫最深，革命的干劲也就最足。二千多年封建社会的历史也就是不断的农民革命起义的历史。因为农民被迫得走头无路，要活命，就只能被“逼上梁山”。在中国共产党领导的革命运动中，农民一直是工人阶级最伟大的同盟军；他们对革命最坚决，牺牲最大，贡献最多。我国农业的社会主义合作化，为什么能够完成得这样迅速而且顺利呢？正是因为农民穷，一个人才分三亩地，有的地方还不到一亩地；又没有拖拉机，才迫切要求合作化。原来有些人们还怀疑：没有拖拉机，是不是能够实现合作化呢？事实说明：正是因为没有拖拉机，才更需要合作化。所以，第一是党的正确领导；第二是我国人民穷，对社会主义革命和建设的干劲就特别足。这样才能说明我们今天能够出现社会主义大跃进这样空前的局面，才能说明我国建设社会主义的速度能够快些，更快些。
    白也是同样：越是在科学文化上落后，对于发展科学文化的要求就越是迫切。劳动人民直接从事生产劳动，他们最能够迫切地感觉到学习、创造与发展科学技术的需要，所以他们学起来不但快，而且切实。看起来知识分子的知识应当最多，其实不然。近来大量的事实都证明：最有知识的是劳动人民。劳动人民从事生产劳动。他们得到的知识最直接、最实在；不像知识分子的知识是从书本上来的，是间接知识，还有些靠不住。因为现在知识分子的知识有很多是从资产阶级那里学来的，还有许多假知识、伪科学。劳动人民因为白，就没有这些负担。“好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”安东机械厂的工人张连城、常逢尧等同志，他们从来没有见过拖拉机（有的只是在电影上看过一眼）凭着自己的智慧和双手，就把拖拉机制造出来了。可是在美国、英国得过博士头衔的电机学教授、专家，却造不出最简单的电气机械。这难道还不能证明“白”是好事吗？
    懂得这些道理，就应该破除迷信，打破自卑感，克服保守思想。有保守思想的人，总觉得自己条件差，不如人，只能落后。他们应该懂得“物极必反”，条件差不能成为消极保守的理由，而应该成为前进的动力。条件差看起来是坏事，其实是好事。正因为落后，就要比先进、学先进、赶先进，从而使落后转化成为先进。报上每天都有许多这样的事例。7月7日人民日报登载：震寰纱厂女工胡兰英同志，原来是个落后的“舞迷子”，结果转变成为“腾云驾雾的金龙”，别班工人都要到她车上来“留学”，提出“比兰英，学兰英，快马加鞭赶兰英”的口号。真是“物极必反”。
                          ＊　＊　＊
    老子说的“祸兮福所倚，福兮祸所伏”就是讲的矛盾转化、物极必反的道理。但是在学习毛泽东同志关于坏事可以变成好事的思想时，有人根据这两句话作诡辩：既然坏事会变好，好事会变坏，那么坏事就是好事，好事也就是坏事；并从而作出结论：无产阶级也有二重性，社会主义也是坏事。这种诡辩论当然不是辩证法。辩证法认为矛盾转化是要有一定的条件的。对立的双方有相互转化的可能性，要使可能性成为现实性，还要有一定的条件。毛泽东同志说：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。没有一定的条件，斗争着的双方都不会转化。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）
    但是有不同的条件。“淮南子”书上讲“塞翁失马”的故事：塞翁失了马，本是祸事；后来失去的马反带了匹骏马归来，祸事变福；他儿子骑马摔坏了腿，福又变祸；但因此而为跛子，发生战争时就没有被征去当兵，祸又变福。这里讲的“物极必反”也是在一定条件下转变的。如果没有带马归来，没有摔坏腿，没有发生战争，矛盾的双方就不可能转化。这些事情就是条件。但是这些条件对塞翁讲，完全是偶然的，所谓“碰运气”。它可能发生，也可能不发生；可能这样发生，也可能那样发生。因此“淮南子”得出祸福的转化是“深不可测”的结论：人对这些条件的产生与否无法预测，就只能听从命运摆布。这就是消极的宿命论，宿命论当然不是革命的辩证法。革命的辩证法就是要能掌握矛盾转化的必然的规律；认识必然的条件，又能主动地掌握它，这样就不是做命运的奴婢，而是做自己命运的主人。
    无产阶级愿意改变自己的地位，有革命的干劲，这是一穷二白能成为好事的条件。但如果只有群众的积极性而没有正确的领导，也还不能转化，以前农民革命的屡次失败就是如此。必须是党的正确领导和群众的革命积极性这两个条件密切结合，像我国今天这样的情况，党的领导越正确，群众的革命积极性越能得到充分的发挥，一穷二白就越加显得是好事，而不是坏事。这样才能完成从必然的王国进入自由王国的飞跃，人的主观能动性才能真正发挥。
    人的主观能动性是很重要的条件。坏事变成好事，或者好事变成坏事，人的主观能动性往往起决定作用。毛泽东同志常常告诫我们：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。这也是说的“物极必反”的道理。已经评为先进的单位，如果骄傲起来，不再求进步，就要变为落后。所以要做不断革命论者，在进步中再进步，是先进的要更先进。
                  ＊　＊　＊
    现在有些“甘居中游”论者利用“物极必反”作诡辩。他们说：既然事物发展到极端，就要向它的反面转化；可见太先进就要变成落后，就要犯错误。因此，力争上游还不如甘居中游，可以不犯错误，不变成落后。
    这当然不是辩证法，上面刚说过：好事变成坏事，坏事变成好事，都要有一定的条件；没有一定的条件，矛盾双方就不会互相转化。不经过艰苦努力，落后不可能变为先进；不在主观上犯错误，先进的也不会变为落后。
    这样说，先进的是否可以永远不动，永远是这样的先进而不会转化呢？当然不是。辩证法不是循环论，循环论认为先进与落后循环反复，逗留不前。辩证法是发展观，认为事物是永远向前发展的。已经先进的单位，如果不倒退，也不能停留在原地。如果它停留在原地，原来比它落后的就一定要赶上它，超过它，它也就从先进变为落后。所以已经先进的单位要想不落后，也要比先进、学先进、赶先进。这样先进的就不是向落后转化，而是向更先进的转化。这才是发展的辩证法。“甘居中游”必然是退居下游，是不可能不变为落后的。
