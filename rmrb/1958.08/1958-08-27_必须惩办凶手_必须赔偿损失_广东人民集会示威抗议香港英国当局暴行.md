They unanimously expressed their support for the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School and demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities must apologize, compensate for all losses, and guarantee that such barbaric acts will not happen again in the future.

After hearing the news of the Hong Kong British authorities' atrocities of forcibly closing the Chung Wah Middle School, assaulting teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School, and Chinese journalists, teachers and students of various universities and colleges in the Guangzhou area immediately gathered and held demonstrations. Chen Xujing, Vice President of Sun Yat-sen University, said angrily: "Not long ago, the Hong Kong British authorities unreasonably expelled Du Boqiu, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, from the country. Now, they are using the excuse of "danger" to close Chung Wah Middle School and assault teachers, students, and Chinese journalists. This is a provocation by the Hong Kong British authorities against our 600 million people, and we will never tolerate it. The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately stop all provocative acts and apologize and compensate. Ling Zhiming, a physics student at Sun Yat-sen University and alumnus of Chung Wah Middle School, and Ye Ningqing, a chemistry student, expressed great anger at the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of teachers and students of their alma mater at the meeting.

More than 660 journalists in Guangzhou also gathered tonight to express their serious protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' blatant act of being hostile to the Chinese people. Participants unanimously pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities actually attacked journalists from our national news agency and other newspapers, which is a serious provocation by the Hong Kong British authorities against the Chinese people. The Hong Kong British authorities must punish the perpetrators.

Workers in factories and residents of streets in Guangzhou City also gathered to protest the atrocities of the Hong Kong authorities after hearing the news.
