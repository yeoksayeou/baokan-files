Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Wakayama dispatch: More than 48,000 teachers, workers, women, and students in Wakayama Prefecture simultaneously held "National Rally to Oppose the Performance Evaluation System and Safeguard Democratic Education" in more than a dozen locations including Wakayama City, Hashimoto City, Gobo City, Tanabe City, Yuasa Town, and Shingu Town on the 15th and 16th to prevent the Kishida Nobusuke government from restoring militaristic education.

More than 30,000 people participated in the central rally held in Wakayama City. Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), representatives of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and Tanaka Orinosuke, representative of the "Buraku Liberation League," all attended and delivered speeches.

The rally adopted a struggle policy to crush the "performance evaluation" system. The policy pointed out that the implementation of the "performance evaluation" system not only destroys children's happiness and democratic education, but will also deprive the working class of its rights.

The policy stipulates: (1) All trade unions must strengthen their solidarity with teachers' unions and take joint action, and call on democratic groups and parents to take action to refuse their children from receiving militaristic education; (2) In the five prefectures, including Hokkaido, where the "performance evaluation" system has not yet been implemented, it is necessary to completely prevent the implementation of the "performance evaluation" system, and in other areas where the "performance evaluation" system has already been implemented, it is necessary to prevent the "evaluation reports" scheduled to be submitted between September and December;
(3) Stop the "Moral Education Instructor Training Courses" to be held between September and October to train personnel to promote militaristic education.

The rally passed a resolution expressing its determination to thoroughly oppose the illegal suppression of teachers' unions and the labor movement, and to oppose the malicious revision of school education curricula.

Amidst enthusiastic applause, the rally read out congratulatory telegrams and letters from the Chinese Educational Trade Union and various domestic and foreign organizations.

On the 16th, after the rally, more than 1,000 young men and women participating in the rally held a massive demonstration in Wakayama City.

On the 16th, the Kishida Nobusuke government actually ordered the Wakayama City police and incited fascist groups to carry out two bloody suppressions against the march, arresting five people on the spot and injuring more than 140 people. Horie Seizo, a student at Doshisha University, suffered a fractured skull, and a reporter from Nippon Television, who was conducting news interviews on the spot, was also beaten by the police. The demonstrators shouted for the release of those arrested and immediately held a sit-down protest in front of the Wakayama City Police Station.

On the morning of the 17th, the Fukuoka Prefecture police authorities also simultaneously searched 96 locations organized by the Fukuoka branch of the Japan Teachers' Union. As of the morning of the 17th, they had arrested 31 people, including Maeda, the chairman of the Fukuoka branch, and continued to arrest people in the afternoon.

In order to protest against the bloody suppression of the demonstration in Wakayama City, the executive committee of the "National Rally to Oppose the Performance Evaluation System and Defend Democratic Education" held an emergency meeting late that night, formed a special committee to oppose the "August 16th" illegal suppression, and decided to turn Wakayama into a second "Sunagawa Town" to launch a large-scale protest struggle.

Today, about 1,000 members of teachers' unions and other trade unions, students, and citizens from various prefectures in Japan held a rally in the square in front of the Wakayama City Hall to protest the Japanese authorities' bloody suppression of the national movement and demand the immediate release of those arrested. The meeting passed a letter of protest to the authorities.

    据新华社17日讯　和歌山消息：日本教职员、工人、妇女和学生四万八千多人15日和16日在和歌山县的和歌山市、桥本市、御坊市、田边市、汤浅镇、新宫镇等十几个地方一齐举行阻止岸信介政府恢复军国主义教育的“反对勤务评定制度、维护民主教育国民大会”。
    参加在和歌山市举行的中央大会有三万多人。日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章和日本共产党、社会党的代表以及“部落解放同盟”代表田中织之进都到会致词。
    大会通过粉碎“勤务评定”制度的斗争方针。方针指出，“勤务评定”制度的实施不仅破坏儿童的幸福和民主教育，还将剥夺工人阶级的权利。
    方针规定：（1）一切工会必须加强同教职员工会的团结和采取联合行动，并且呼吁民主团体和家长采取拒绝子弟接受军国主义教育的行动；（2）在北海道等地方尚未实行“勤务评定”制度的五个县，必须彻底阻止实行“勤务评定”制度，其他已经实行“勤务评定”制度的地区要阻止预定在9月到12月期间提出的“评定书”；
  （3）阻止将在9月到10月期间召开的训练推行军国主义教育人员的“道德教育指导员讲习会”。
    大会通过一项决议，表示要彻底反对对教职员工会和工人运动的非法镇压，并且反对恶劣地修改学校教育课程。
    大会在热烈掌声中宣读了中国教育工会以及国内和外国各团体的贺电和贺信。
    16日，在大会结束后，参加大会的一千多青年男女在和歌山市内举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
    岸信介政府在16日竟指令和歌山市警察和唆使法西斯团体向游行队伍进行了两次血腥镇压，当场捕去了五人、打伤了一百四十多人。同志社大学学生堀江静三的脑后骨被打裂，当场进行新闻采访活动的日本电视公司记者也被警察殴打。游行队伍高呼要求释放被捕者，并且立即到和歌山市的警察署前面举行了静坐斗争。
    17日早晨，福冈县警察当局又对日本教职员工会福冈分会组织的九十六个地方一齐进行搜查，截至17日上午为止，逮捕了福冈分会委员长前田等三十一人，下午还去继续捕人。
      “反对勤务评定制度、保卫民主教育国民大会”执行委员会为了反对在和歌山市内发生的血腥镇压示威游行事件，当天深夜召开紧急会议，组成了反对“八·一六”非法镇压特别委员会，并且决定把和歌山当作第二个“砂川町”，展开大规模的抗议斗争。
    今天日本各府县教职员工会和其他工会会员、学生、市民等约一千人在和歌山市政府前面的广场上举行大会，抗议日本当局血腥镇压国民运动，要求立即释放被捕者。会上通过了给当局的抗议书。
