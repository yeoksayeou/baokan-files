　　Socialist Neighborhood Pact

　　I. Strengthen unity and mutual assistance. When a family has problems or illness, everyone should actively help each other, take care of each other's children, and look after each other when going out to buy groceries. Sincerely criticize others' shortcomings and humbly accept opinions, without harboring resentment.

　　II. Pay attention to fire prevention, and everyone should check at all times. Street doors must be tightly secured and closed at all times, and checked at night to prevent bad people from causing trouble. Obey household registration rules, report visitors promptly, and cancel registrations when people leave.

　　III. Maintain "Four Nos and Three Cleans" in the long term. The person on duty should be responsible for the day's cleanliness, cleaning up any dirty areas at any time, and insist on sweeping the streets and sprinkling water twice a day. Toilet lids must be closed after use, and mosquitoes and flies should be killed whenever seen, without letting one go. Regardless of adults or children, wash hair frequently, bathe frequently, and change clothes frequently. Be sure to wash hands before meals and after using the toilet. Pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene for all food items. Fruits should be washed before eating. Pay attention to adding or removing clothes for children according to the weather to prevent illness.

　　IV. Live frugally and manage the household diligently. Family expenses should be planned, and multiple ways should be considered to save food, cloth, coal, water, electricity, and other materials.

　　V. Those participating in literacy classes should never stop learning, no matter how cold or hot it is, or how busy they are, and must persevere until graduation. Read the newspaper once every day at 6:30 AM.

　　VI. Abide by all government policies and laws, respond to all government calls, and actively participate in various activities. Those who attend meetings should relay the information to those who could not attend.

　　社会主义邻里公约
    一、加强团结互助。一家有事有病，大家主动帮助，互相照顾孩子，上街买菜彼此照应。发现别人缺点诚恳展开批评，虚心接受意见，不要心里不高兴。
    二、注意防火，大家要随时检查。街门要严，随时关好，晚上要检查，防止坏人生事。要遵守户口规则，来人随报，人走了就销。
    三、长期保持四无三洁。值班人要负责一天的清洁，哪儿脏了随时打扫，每天要坚持扫街洒水两次，厕所盖要随手盖好，看见蚊蝇就打，决不放过一个。不论大人小孩，要勤洗头、勤洗澡、勤换衣。饭前、便后一定要洗手。一切吃的东西都要注意清洁卫生，水果要洗过再吃，天气冷热要注意给小孩增减衣服，防止生病。
    四、勤俭过日、勤俭持家。家庭开支要有计划，要多方面想办法节约粮食、布、煤、水电等物资。
    五、参加扫盲学习的，不论多冷热、事情多忙，绝不停止学习，一定坚持毕业。每天六点半要读报一次。
    六、要遵守政府一切政策法令，响应政府一切号召，积极参加各项活动。参加会的人要给去不了的人作传达。
