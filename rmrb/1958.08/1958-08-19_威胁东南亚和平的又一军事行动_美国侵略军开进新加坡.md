Xinhua News Agency, August 18th. The U.S. government, which has been strongly condemned by the people of the world for sending troops to invade Lebanon, is now sending its warships and Marines to Singapore, directly threatening peace in the Southeast Asian region.

    U.S. Navy officials, in announcing on the 17th that U.S. warships and troops were entering this British military base in Southeast Asia, said that the U.S. was doing so to "help any friendly country in the Indian Ocean that may be affected by the Middle East crisis," and that "they will remain there for the time being."

    According to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore today, a U.S. "support force" that has arrived in Singapore over the past ten days includes six warships and nearly two thousand Marines. This batch of U.S. Marines was transferred from the U.S. Marine Corps Third Division based in Okinawa. The six warships include two destroyers, two transport ships, a dock landing ship, and a cargo ship. In addition, a number of U.S. giant "Globemaster" transport planes arrived in Singapore with the equipment for this force.

    Official sources in Washington indicate that the establishment of a military base in Singapore by the United States is only a link in the U.S. attempt to establish a series of military bases from the Middle East to the Indian Ocean. U.S. Navy officials announced that the U.S. Navy had been "intensifying efforts" nine months ago to establish "fuel and other material supply stations" at "strategic" ports along the Indian Ocean coast. They also said that the U.S. Navy hopes to increase fuel and other supplies in Southeast Asia and the Middle East for use by any U.S. naval forces operating there.

    The U.S. action to create tension in the Southeast Asian region is obviously being carried out in collusion with Britain. A British naval spokesman in Singapore stated that British naval facilities in Singapore would be available to the U.S. Navy, and that the U.S. military could freely establish its own warehouses.

    People in Singapore oppose the arrival of U.S. troops. Former Singapore Chief Minister Marshall pointed out today that the U.S. Navy's use of Singapore is "not good" for this colony. He pointed out, "Singapore is a free port, and it should be an undefended city free from the threat of war."

    Marshall emphasized, "The presence of U.S. warships in Singapore endangers Singapore's friendly relations with other countries."

### 威胁东南亚和平的又一军事行动　美国侵略军开进新加坡

　　威胁东南亚和平的又一军事行动
　　美国侵略军开进新加坡
    新华社18日讯　由于出兵侵略黎巴嫩而遭到世界人民强烈谴责的美国政府，现在又把它的军舰和海军陆战队开到新加坡，直接威胁东南亚地区的和平。
    美国海军部官员17日在宣布美国军舰和军队开入这个英国在东南亚的军事基地时说，美国这样做是为了“帮助印度洋中可能受到中东危机影响的任何友好国家”，“他们目前将留在那里”。
    据路透社今天从新加坡发出的消息透露，在过去十天中开到新加坡的一支美国“支援部队”，包括六艘军舰和近两千名海军陆战队。这批美国海军陆战队是从以冲绳岛为基地的美国海军陆战队第三师调来的。六艘军舰中有：两艘驱逐舰、两艘运输舰、一艘船坞登陆舰和一艘货船。另外，还有一批美国巨型的“全球霸王式”运输机带着这支部队的装备抵达新加坡。
    华盛顿官方的消息表明，美国在新加坡建立军事基地仅是美国企图从中东到印度洋设立一系列的军事基地的一个环节。美国海军部官员宣布，美国海军在九个月以前就在“加紧努力”，要在印度洋沿岸的“战略要冲”港口设立“燃料和其他物资的供应站”。他们又说，美国海军希望增加东南亚和中东地区的燃料和其他供应品，以供在那里活动的任何美国海军部队使用。
    美国制造东南亚地区紧张局势的行动显然是在同英国勾结下进行的。新加坡的英国海军发言人声明，英国海军在新加坡的设备将供美国海军使用，美军并可随意设立自己的仓库。
    新加坡人士反对美国军队的到来。前新加坡首席部长马歇尔今天指出，美国海军使用新加坡对这个殖民地“没有好处”。他指出，“新加坡是一个自由港，它应该是一个不受战争威胁的不设防城市。”
    马歇尔强调说，“美国军舰驻在新加坡危及了新加坡同其他国家的友好关系。”（附图片）
