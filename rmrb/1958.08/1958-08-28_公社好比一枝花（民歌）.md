The commune is like a flower,
This fresh flower is planted by the Party.
Dengfeng's flowers grow well,
Good news spreads to thousands of families.
Farmers hear and laugh together,
Agricultural mechanization is realized.
Everyone attends agricultural university,
And will become experts in the future.

Workers hear and jump for joy,
Factories will also run schools.
Scientific knowledge is all learned,
Agricultural technology is also mastered.

Students hear and sing loudly,
Work-study programs run factories.
General knowledge of all subjects is familiar,
Combining work and agriculture is the direction.

The commune is like a flower,
The Party waters and cultivates it.
This fresh flower blooms well,
A happy life depends entirely on it.

　　公社好比一枝花（民歌）
　　公社好比一枝花，
　　这枝鲜花党来插。
　　登封鲜花长的好，
　　喜讯传遍千万家。
　　农民听到齐欢笑，
　　农业实现机械化。
　　农业大学大家上，
　　将来也要当专家。
　　工人听到蹦又跳，
　　工厂也要办学校。
　　科学知识都学习，
　　农业技术也通啦。
　　学生听到高歌唱，
　　勤工俭学办工厂。
　　各科常识都熟悉，
　　亦工亦农是方向。
　　公社好比一枝花，
　　党来浇水培育它。
　　这枝鲜花开的好，
　　幸福生活全靠它。
