　　One Set of Equipment, Multiple Uses
    Dongfeng Commune's Granular Fertilizer Factory Can Produce Fertilizer, Pesticides, and Chemical Raw Materials
    (Our newspaper's reporter Wu Gang reports): From the soil to the foreign, from the indigenous to the modern, the granular fertilizer factory run by the Shajing Production Team of the Dongfeng Agricultural Commune in the suburbs of Xi'an has been continuously upgraded and is now a comprehensive small chemical plant.
    This factory has invested a total of more than fifty yuan, using a pot, some vats, gasoline drums, baskets, and ropes, and while producing large quantities of granular fertilizer, it has also produced six kinds of indigenous fertilizers. Recently, it successfully trial-produced the pesticide needed to control black穗 disease – also a chemical raw material needed for plastics, nylon, and synthetic rubber – furfural. In late February of this year, this production team started this granular fertilizer factory because of a lack of fertilizer. Six commune members and ten cadres sent to work at the lower levels participated in the production. They produced more than 90,000 jin of granular fertilizer for summer and autumn crops. Granular fertilizer is made from farm organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer raw materials such as superphosphate and ammonium sulfate. Later, because of the lack of these chemical fertilizer raw materials, production was in danger of being interrupted, so they stepped out of the circle of using fertilizer to make fertilizer and decided to make their own substitutes, solving the problem of the lack of fertilizer sources. They successively trial-produced and produced nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium composite fertilizer, indigenous urea, indigenous fertilizer powder, crude phosphate fertilizer, and ammonia water, and other six kinds of indigenous fertilizers, upgrading the granular fertilizer factory to an indigenous fertilizer factory. More than 40,000 jin of granular fertilizer were made using these indigenous fertilizers, solving the fertilizer problem needed for autumn vegetables.
    In order to make full use of the equipment of the indigenous fertilizer factory and to comprehensively utilize crop straws, they successfully trial-produced furfural while manufacturing indigenous fertilizer. In terms of equipment, they only bought a pot, some vats, some water pipes, and two gasoline drums. The manufacturing method is also very simple. Now they are studying and improving technical problems such as the natural decomposition of water and furfural, so that they can formally put it into production as soon as possible. According to their preliminary plan, in addition to further expanding the production of indigenous fertilizer, they can also produce 400 jin of furfural per day. The value of furfural alone reaches more than 3,000 yuan, while the cost is less than 400 yuan. Now they are further studying how to make fertilizer from the wheat straw waste after extracting furfural.
    The continuous upgrading of the Shajing Production Team's granular fertilizer factory and the continuous addition of new varieties point out a new direction for the fertilizer factory to comprehensively utilize existing equipment and manpower, as well as crop straws.

### 一套设备　多种用处  东风社颗粒肥料厂能制化肥、农药和化工原料

　　一套设备　多种用处
    东风社颗粒肥料厂能制化肥、农药和化工原料
    本报讯　记者吴钢报道：土中出洋，由土到洋，西安市郊区东风农业社沙井生产队办的颗粒肥料厂不断升级，现在已经是一座综合性的小化工厂了。
    这个厂先后共投资五十多元，用一口锅、一些缸和汽油桶、筐子和绳子，在大量生产颗粒肥料的同时，还生产了六种土化肥，最近又成功地试造出治黑穗病所需要的农药——也是塑料、尼龙和合成橡胶所需的化学原料——糠醛。今年2月下旬，这个生产队因为缺乏肥料，才办起这个颗粒肥料厂。参加生产的有六个社员和十个下放干部。他们共为夏秋作物生产了九万多斤颗粒肥料。颗粒肥料是利用农家有机肥料与过磷酸钙、硫酸铵等化肥原料作成的。以后，因为这些化肥原料缺乏，生产有中断的危险，他们就走出以肥制肥的圈子，决定自制代用品，解决了肥料来源缺乏的问题。他们陆续试制和生产了氮磷钾综合肥料，土制尿素、土制肥田粉、粗制磷肥和铵水等六种土化肥，使颗粒肥料厂升级为土化肥厂了。用这些土化肥继续造了四万多斤颗粒肥料，解决了秋菜所需的肥料问题。
    为了充分利用土化肥厂的设备和综合利用农作物秸壳，他们在制造土化肥的同时，试制糠醛成功。在设备方面，只买了一口锅、一些缸和一些水管、两个汽油桶。制造方法也很简单。现在他们正在研究改进水和糠醛的自然分解等技术问题，以便早日正式投入生产。按照他们初步计划，除了进一步扩大土化肥生产外，还可日产四百斤糠醛。仅糠醛一项价值即达三千多元，而成本还不到四百元。现在他们正在进一步研究，怎样才能把提取过糠醛的麦秸下脚料做肥料的问题，
    沙井生产队颗粒肥料厂不断升级，不断增加新品种，这就为肥料厂综合利用现有设备和人力以及农作物秸壳指出了新的方向。
