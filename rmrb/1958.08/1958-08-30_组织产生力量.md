　　Organization Generates Strength
　　Wu Lü
    In the news about the CCP Wuxi Municipal Committee's specific leadership in steel production, we see a miracle: yesterday the output of pig iron was only three tons, today it increased to seven tons, the next day it increased to fifteen tons, and the third day it continued to increase to eighteen tons. The reporter used an idiom, "soaring upwards," which is absolutely true.
    Why can Wuxi's pig iron production soar upwards and rise step by step? The most important reason is that they organized the city's scattered indigenous blast furnaces and implemented centralized leadership. Organized, five hundred indigenous blast furnaces are still five hundred indigenous blast furnaces, the quantity has not increased, but the advanced indigenous blast furnaces have driven the general indigenous blast furnaces, and the production level of the general indigenous blast furnaces has quickly improved to the level of the advanced indigenous blast furnaces, and the output has increased several times. This is the power generated by organization.
    The process of social production development is originally the process of a small number of advanced production levels becoming the production level of the entire society. However, in a very long historical period, this process was spontaneous, and therefore very slow. In capitalist society, although the development of production technology is relatively fast, due to the constraints of production relations, the transformation of a small number of advanced production levels into the production level of the whole society is not only still a spontaneous process, but this process is also hindered by competition and monopoly. Therefore, the transformation of a small number of advanced production levels into the production level of the whole society is still a slow process, and some are even strangled by monopoly capital. Socialist society liberates the productive forces from the shackles of capitalist production relations, making it possible for a small number of advanced production levels to become the production level of the whole society at a speed unprecedented in history.
    However, possibility is only a possibility after all. To turn possibility into reality, it is still necessary to do organizational work. If we do not organize, the transformation of a small number of advanced production levels into the production level of the whole society is still a spontaneous process. The spontaneous process will never produce high speed. Take indigenous blast furnaces as an example: tens of thousands have been built across the country, some of which are high-yield and long-lived, and some of which are not producing normally. If we do not organize these indigenous blast furnaces, concentrate their advantages, and promote them universally, then, although the experience of high-yield furnaces and long-lived furnaces has already paved the way for latecomers, it will still be a slow process to get all tens of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces in the country to embark on this path and reach the level of advanced indigenous blast furnaces. Conversely, like the CCP Wuxi Municipal Committee, organizing indigenous blast furnaces and using measures such as "four fixings" to organize the process of transforming a small number of advanced production levels into the production level of the whole society into a conscious process will inevitably result in soaring output and the possibility of high-speed development of social production becoming a reality.
    We are promoters. Promoters are not only incompatible with regressives, but also incompatible with the phenomenon of laissez-faire. We must promote everything that is moving forward; letting things take their own course, and not using human subjective initiative to accelerate the process of the development of things, is always dereliction of duty for promoters. Now, the steel battle is in full swing. This battle is one of the decisive battles in the great leap forward of the national economy, and indigenous blast furnaces are an important and pivotal front in the steel battle. Every place has a batch of indigenous blast furnaces with high output and long life. As long as everyone does the work of organizing and transforms the production level of advanced indigenous blast furnaces into the production level of all indigenous blast furnaces as soon as possible, it will not be difficult for the national output of pig iron to soar upwards.

　　组织产生力量
　　吴滤
    在中共无锡市委具体领导钢铁生产的新闻中，我们看到一个奇迹：昨天生铁的产量只三吨，今天就增加到七吨，第二天又增加到十五吨，第三天继续增加到十八吨。记者用了一句成语：“扶摇直上”，真是一点也不假。
    为什么无锡的生铁产量能够扶摇直上、步步高升呢？最主要的原因，在于他们把全市分散的土高炉组织起来，实行集中领导。组织起来，五百座土高炉还是五百座土高炉，数量并没有增加，但先进的土高炉带动了一般的土高炉，一般土高炉的生产水平很快提高到先进土高炉的水平，产量翻了几倍。这就是组织产生的力量。
    社会生产发展的过程，本来就是少数先进的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程。不过，在很长的历史时期里，这个过程是自流的，因而也是非常缓慢的。到了资本主义社会，生产技术的发展虽然比较快，但由于生产关系的束缚，少数先进的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平，不但仍然是个自流的过程，而且这个过程还被竞争和垄断所阻拦，因而少数先进的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平，还是一个缓慢的过程，甚至有的还被垄断资本所扼杀了。社会主义社会把生产力从资本主义生产关系的束缚底下解放出来，使少数先进的生产水平，有可能以历史上从未有过的高速度变为全社会的生产水平。
    然而，可能毕竟只是可能。要把可能变成现实，还需要去做组织工作。如果不去组织，少数先进的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平，也还是一个自流的过程。自流的过程，是决不会产生高速度的。就拿土高炉来说吧：全国已经建成了几万座，其中有高产的、长寿的，也有生产不正常的。如果我们不把这些土高炉组织起来，集中它们的优点，普遍推广，那么，尽管高产炉、长寿炉的经验已经为后来者开辟了道路，但是要让全国几万座土高炉都走上这条道路，都攀上先进土高炉的水平，也还是一个缓慢的过程。反之，像中共无锡市委那样，把土高炉组织起来，用“四定”等措施，把少数先进的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程，组织成一个自觉的过程，结果必然是产量扶摇直上，高速度发展社会生产的可能变成现实。
    我们是促进派。促进派同促退派固然势不两立，同放任自流的现象也不相容。一切前进的事情，我们都要去促进；听其自流，不用人的主观能动性去加速事物发展的进程，对于促进派说来，永远是失职的行为。现在，钢铁大战如火如荼，这一场大战是国民经济大跃进中具有决定意义的战役之一，而土高炉则是钢铁大战中举足轻重的一条重要战线。各个地方都有一批产量高、寿命长的土高炉，只要大家都去做组织起来的工作，把先进的土高炉的生产水平，尽快地变成全社会土高炉的生产水平，全国生铁的产量也就不难扶摇直上。
