    Another Good Method

    When Chairman Mao inspected Tianjin, he said: Cadres in government offices should also run some affiliated factories, otherwise they will only talk about theory and be divorced from reality. Following closely, the directly subordinate organs committees of the Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipality acted. They did it very well.

    It is naturally a good thing for cadres in government offices to run some affiliated factories and increase some material wealth for society; but the most important benefit is that it can enable cadres to come into contact with reality and not talk empty words.

    The reasoning is not difficult to understand. Although the Party and state organs have transferred a large number of cadres to factories and rural areas, and many cadres take turns going to the countryside and factories to participate in voluntary labor, there are still more cadres sitting in offices. After sitting for a long time, some people inevitably suffer from a kind of "occupational disease," becoming empty talkers, or even "skeptics" and "watchers" in the face of new things. When government offices run their own factories, and cadres directly participate in production for a certain period of time, this "occupational disease" can be slowly and fundamentally cured; revolutionary enthusiasm can naturally be kept high; and furthermore, the boundary between mental and manual labor can be broken, turning them into new socialist cadres who are both cadres and workers, both red and expert, and capable of both writing and martial arts.

    又一良方
    毛主席在天津视察的时候说：机关干部也要办点附属工厂，不然光讲空的，脱离实际。紧跟着，中共河北省、天津市直属机关委员会就行动起来了。他们做得很对。
    机关干部办点附属工厂，给社会增加一些物质财富，自然是好事；但最主要的好处，是能使干部接触实际，不讲空话。
    道理不难理解，党和国家机关虽然先后下放了大批干部到工厂农村中去，还有许多干部轮流下乡下厂，参加义务劳动等等，然而毕竟还有更多的干部坐办公室，时间坐长了，有些人就难免害上一种“职业病”，变成了空谈家，甚至变成新事物面前的“怀疑派”“观潮派”。机关自己办了工厂，干部用一定的时间直接参加生产，就能慢慢从根本上治好这种“职业病”；革命干劲自然就能经常鼓得足足的；进而打破脑力同体力劳动之间的界限，变成既是干部又是工人，又红又专，能文能武的社会主义新型干部。
