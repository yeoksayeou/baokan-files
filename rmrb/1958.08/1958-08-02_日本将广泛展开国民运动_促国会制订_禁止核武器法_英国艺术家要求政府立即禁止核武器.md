Xinhua News Agency, August 1st, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution has decided to launch a broad national movement to urge the Japanese Diet to enact a "Law Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons."

    A spokesperson for the Federation announced at a press conference today that, given the current Kishi Nobusuke government's violation of its promises to the Japanese people, its attempts to violate the Constitution by transporting nuclear weapons into Japan, and its efforts to nuclear-arm the "Self-Defense Forces," the Federation believes it is necessary to urge the Diet to enact a "Law Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons" to prevent such attempts by the Kishi Nobusuke government and expose its conspiracies.

    The Federation suggests that the "Law Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons" include the following provisions: prohibiting the use, manufacture, storage, and testing of all nuclear weapons within Japanese territory; prohibiting the transportation of nuclear weapons from foreign countries; prohibiting the central government, local governments, public organizations, and civilian groups, as well as any individual, from holding training and exercises related to nuclear weapons; and requiring the establishment of a supervisory committee in the Diet to oversee the implementation of this law.

    The Federation has also decided to launch a comprehensive signature campaign from September of this year to the end of March next year, demanding the enactment of a "Law Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons," while also urging local assemblies at all levels to pass declarations of nuclear disarmament and resolutions supporting the "Law Prohibiting Nuclear Weapons."

    The Federation has decided to cooperate with the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to jointly promote this movement. To this end, Federation Chairman Tetsuji Katayama and Commissioner Akira Kazami specially visited Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, today. Yasui immediately replied that the Council, based on the decision of the Standing Councilors, will jointly promote this movement with the Federation. Yasui also stated that he would raise the issue of carrying out this movement at the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 31st, London dispatch: According to a report in the "News Chronicle" on July 30th, three hundred British artists of different factions have jointly written a letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan, demanding an immediate ban on nuclear weapons.

    The letter said: "Regardless of style and school, the artist's desire is to enrich and affirm human life, and the current danger of nuclear war is a threat to all people." The letter pointed out that if a nuclear war were to occur, it would bring not only material destruction but also "spiritual and moral destruction."

    Signatories to the letter include Augustus John, Ruskin Spear, Henry Moore, and Barbara Hepworth, among others.

    The letter has also been distributed to the U.S. and Soviet Ambassadors to London.

    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本拥护宪法国民联合会决定广泛展开国民运动，促使日本国会制订“禁止核武器法”。
    联合会发言人今天在记者招待会上宣布，鉴于目前岸信介政府违背对日本人民作出的诺言，企图违反宪法把核武器运进日本，并且使“自卫队”进行核武装。联合会认为必须促使国会制订“禁止核武器法”，以阻止岸信介政府的这种企图，揭发它的阴谋。
    联合会建议使“禁止核武器法”包括下列规定：禁止在日本境内使用、制造、储藏和试验一切核武器，禁止从外国运进核武器；禁止中央政府、地方政府、公共团体和民间团体以及任何个人举行有关核武器的训练和演习；要求在国会中设立监察委员会，监督这项法律的实施。
    联合会还决定，从今年9月到明年3月底这段期间，全面展开要求制订“禁止核武器法”的签名运动，同时促使各级地方议会通过无核武装宣言和支持“禁止核武器法”的决议。
    联合会决定同日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会合作，共同推进这一运动。为此，联合会主席片山哲和委员风见章今天特地访问了禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁。安井当即答复，协议会根据常任理事会的决定，将同联合会共同推进这个运动。安井并且表示将在第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会上提出开展这一运动的问题。
    新华社31日讯　伦敦消息：据“新闻纪事报”7月30日报道，三百名不同派别的英国艺术家联名写了一封信给英国首相麦克米伦，要求立即禁止核武器。
    这封信说：“不管风格和流派如何，艺术家的愿望是丰富和肯定人类的生活，而在目前核战争的危险是对所有的人的威胁。”这封信指出，如果发生了核战争，那么在带来物质方面的毁灭的同时也将带来“精神和道义方面的毁灭”。
    在这封信上签名的有奥古斯塔斯·约翰、腊斯金·斯皮尔、亨利·摩尔、巴巴拉·赫普沃斯等人。
    这封信同时也分送给美国和苏联驻伦敦大使。
