Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 30th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) issued a statement today demanding that the United States immediately cease its armed interference in China's internal affairs. It also demanded that the Japanese government adhere to a position of non-involvement in the provocative actions of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique against China.

The statement pointed out that the United States' deployment of its air force stationed in Japan and its naval fleet stationed in Okinawa to Taiwan, actively creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, is not only armed interference in China's internal affairs but also carries the risk of triggering a world war.

The statement strongly opposed the United States' armed interference in China's internal affairs and the Kishi Nobusuke government's assistance to the United States in creating tension.

The Japanese Socialist Party held a joint meeting of its International Bureau, Policy Deliberation Council, and Special Committee for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations on the 29th, issuing a statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The statement said that the Socialist Party opposes American political and military interference in Jinmen and Mazu. The statement pointed out that the presence and increase of military power, especially of the US Seventh Fleet, in the Taiwan Strait will deepen the crisis. Therefore, the Socialist Party opposes these actions by the United States.

Many newspapers have expressed concern about the situation in the Taiwan Strait and have warned the United States against taking any rash actions.
