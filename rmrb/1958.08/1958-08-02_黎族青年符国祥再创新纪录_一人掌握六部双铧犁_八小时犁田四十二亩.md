    Li Youth Fu Guoxiang Sets New Record Again
    Mastering Six Double-Share Plows, Plowing Forty-Two Mu in Eight Hours
    Fu Guoxiang, a Li youth member of the Sanhe Cooperative in Ledong County, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guangdong Province, performed a demonstration of simultaneously controlling six double-wheeled, double-share plows in front of more than 1,500 people.
    As early as June 11th, Fu Guoxiang had already created the advanced deed of controlling three double-wheeled, double-share plows and plowing twenty-one mu of land in one day. On July 1st, his plowing progress with three double-wheeled, double-share plows further increased to 39.5 mu. Fu Guoxiang was not complacent; he pondered day and night how to further improve his technique on the existing basis. Therefore, he decided to use six double-share plows and discussed this idea with the Party branch secretary and the resident cooperative cadres, receiving their encouragement and support. From then on, he actively trained the oxen and finally succeeded in the experiment on July 9th.
    On July 11th, Qianjia Township in Ledong County held a production mobilization meeting for more than 1,500 people. During the meeting, Fu Guoxiang calmly performed in front of everyone. He first tied every two of the six double-share plows together with iron wire, forming three large sets in total. Then, he arranged every two plows on a plowing line, forming outer, middle, and inner plowing lines. Each large set of double-share plows was four feet five inches apart. After arranging them, he adjusted the depth of entry of all six plows to be consistent. Each pair of plows was matched with three oxen. After the oxen were harnessed to the plows, he tied the reins of the two oxen on the right to the horn of the third ox on the left. Then, he stood on the left, holding the three reins, and directed the three large plows to begin plowing forward. After starting, he frequently checked to ensure that the three large plows advanced in a balanced manner. On that day, he plowed a total of forty-two mu of land in eight hours.

    黎族青年符国祥再创新纪录
    一人掌握六部双铧犁  八小时犁田四十二亩
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治州乐东县三合社黎族青年社员符国祥，在一千五百多人面前作了同时掌握六部双轮双铧犁的表演。
    早在6月11日，符国祥就创造了一人掌握三部双轮双铧犁，一天犁田二十一亩的先进事迹。7月1日，他用三部双轮双铧犁的犁田进度又增加到三十九点五亩。符国祥并不骄傲，他日夜思量如何在现有基础上再把技术提高一步。于是，他决定用六部双铧犁，并把这个意见跟党支部书记和驻社干部商量，得到他们鼓励和支持。从此，他就积极训练耕牛，终于在7月9日试验成功。
    7月11日那天，乐东县千家乡召开了一千五百多人的生产誓师大会。大会间隙中，符国祥在大家面前沉着地进行表演。他首先将六部双铧犁每两部用铁线系在一起，共系成三大部，然后每两部排在一条耕作线上，共排成外、中、内三条耕作线。每一大部双铧犁前后相距四尺五寸。排好后便将六部犁的入土深度调节一致。每两部犁配三头牛，牛负好犁后，便将右边的两头牛的牛绳系在左边的第三头牛的角上，然后他站在左边携着三条牛绳，指挥三大部犁开犁前进。开犁后经常进行检查，使三大部犁平衡前进。这天，他用八个小时共犁了四十二亩田。　（据新华社讯）
