Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The people of all circles in the capital held a grand rally in the CPPCC Auditorium tonight, warmly celebrating the success of the "Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference" and supporting the "Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament" to be held in Tokyo on the 15th of this month.

More than 1,500 representatives unanimously adopted a resolution at tonight's meeting, determined to strive for the complete realization of all the resolutions of the "Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference" with effective practical actions, resolutely demanding that the US aggressor troops immediately withdraw completely from Lebanon, Japan, South Korea, our territory of Taiwan and all foreign territories, cancel all US military bases set up in foreign countries, resolutely demand that the British aggressor troops immediately withdraw completely from Jordan, warmly support the upcoming Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, and demand that the United States and Britain immediately stop nuclear weapons tests and reach an international agreement on disarmament issues as soon as possible. The conference resolution also warmly endorsed the communiqué of the talks between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, believing that "it reflects the common aspirations of the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, and is a new and great inspiration to the current struggle of the world's people against aggression and in defense of peace."

Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the "Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference" in Stockholm and chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, made a report to the conference, comprehensively expounding the great achievements and significance of the "Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference."

Guo Moruo's report from time to time won thunderous applause from the audience, and more than 1,500 people constantly shouted slogans against US-British aggression and in defense of world peace.

Tonight's conference was presided over by Liu Ningyi, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. Liao Chengzhi, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and heads of various people's organizations attended the conference. Also attending the conference were peace representatives from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Burma, Ceylon, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Finland, India, Indonesia, Japan, North Korea, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay and other countries. The weightlifting team of the United Arab Republic, headed by Mohammed Ahmed Nasr, also attended the conference. Liu Ningyi extended a warm welcome to all foreign guests attending the conference in his opening remarks.

Guests from seven countries were invited to speak at the conference. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the audience.

Mr. Mohammed Ahmed Nasr of the United Arab Republic said that the victory of the Egyptian people in opposing imperialism two years ago was due to our determination to defend our motherland and the support of the Soviet people, the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of all countries. He said, I am convinced that as long as the people of the world unanimously support peace and work to avoid the recurrence of war, this is the only guarantee that the imperialist aggression plot will not succeed.

Mr. Abbas of Indonesia said, we, the Indonesian people, condemn the arms race carried out by the United States, condemn the hydrogen bomb tests carried out by the United States in our territory, and condemn the aggression carried out by the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan. We, the Indonesian people, support the upcoming Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament to be held in Tokyo.

Mr. Parra of Chile spoke on behalf of the peace-loving people of Latin American countries. He said that the people of Latin American countries have contributed their strength to peace for several years. The Latin American Public Conference, scheduled to be held in the capital of Argentina next April, will discuss issues such as striving for national sovereignty, disarmament and international cooperation.

Mr. Reddy of India said that countries that send aggressor troops to Lebanon and Jordan have no right to call themselves "free and democratic countries," and their troops have no right to go to a country that needs peace and national independence, aggression must be stopped, nuclear weapons tests must be stopped, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries must be stopped. The most important issue now is to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Reddy said that with peace-loving people like the Soviet Union, China and India in the world, who are united with the peace-loving people of all countries, lasting peace can certainly be established throughout the world.

Mr. Hartley of Australia said that because the Australian government takes a submissive attitude towards US imperialism, Australian territory is being used by US and British imperialism as a nuclear weapons test site. The Australian people resolutely demand an immediate end to nuclear weapons tests and advocate the development of international cooperation.

Mr. U Ohkata of Burma said that the publication of the communiqué of the talks between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev is "very helpful to world peace." He called on Western countries to follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately stop nuclear weapons tests.

Mr. Saionji Kinkazu of Japan, in his speech, expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Japanese people for the strong support given by the conference to the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament to be held in Tokyo. He said that the Japanese people, who have personally experienced the atomic bomb disaster, resolutely demand that Western countries follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately stop nuclear weapons tests. We must wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist policies of the United States and its followers.

The meeting also announced two congratulatory messages from the International Preparatory Committee of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for World Disarmament and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

The conference finally unanimously adopted the "Resolution of the People of All Circles in Beijing Celebrating the Success of the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference and Supporting the Fourth Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament." At this time, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause, and the slogans of "Stop Aggression, Defend Peace" rose one after another, continuously. (Attached picture)

    一千五百多位代表在今晚的大会上一致通过决议，决心以有效的实际行动为彻底实现“裁军和国际合作大会”的全部决议而奋斗，坚决要求美国侵略军队立即从黎巴嫩、日本、南朝鲜、我国领土台湾以及一切外国领土全部撤出去，取消一切美国在外国设置的军事基地，坚决要求英国侵略军队立即从约旦全部撤出去，热烈支持即将召开的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，要求美国和英国立即停止核武器试验和尽早地就裁军问题达成国际协议。大会决议还热烈拥护中苏两国领导人的会谈公报，认为“它反映了中苏两国人民和一切爱好和平人民的共同愿望，对当前全世界人民反对侵略和保卫和平的斗争是一个新的巨大的鼓舞。”
    出席斯德哥尔摩“裁军和国际合作大会”的中国代表团团长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若向大会做报告，全面论述了“裁军和国际合作大会”的重大成就和意义。（报告全文见第四版）
    郭沫若的报告不时地博得全场雷鸣般的欢迎掌声，一千五百多人不断地高呼反对美英侵略行为和保卫世界和平的口号。
    今晚的大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席刘宁一主持。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志和各人民团体的负责人出席了大会。出席大会的还有阿根廷、澳大利亚、巴西、缅甸、锡兰、智利、哥伦比亚、古巴、芬兰、印度、印度尼西亚、日本、朝鲜、新西兰、巴基斯坦、巴拉圭等国家的和平代表。以穆罕默德·阿赫米德·纳斯尔为首的阿拉伯联合共和国举重队也出席了大会。刘宁一在大会开幕词中对出席大会的全体外宾表示热烈欢迎。
    有七个国家的来宾应邀在大会上讲话。他们的讲话受到全场听众的热烈欢迎。
    阿拉伯联合共和国的穆罕默德·阿赫米德·纳斯尔先生说，两年前，埃及人民在反对帝国主义中所取得的胜利，是由于我们有着捍卫祖国的决心，以及苏联人民、中国人民和各国和平人民的支援所取得的结果。他说，我确信，只要全世界人民一致支持和平和为避免战火再次燃起而工作，这就是使帝国主义的侵略阴谋不能得逞的唯一保证。
    印度尼西亚的阿巴斯先生说，我们印度尼西亚人民谴责美国所进行的军备竞赛，谴责美国在我国领土所进行的氢弹试验，谴责美英在黎巴嫩和约旦所进行的侵略。我们印度尼西亚人民支持最近将在东京举行的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会。
    智利的帕拉先生代表拉丁美洲各国的和平人民讲话。他说，拉丁美洲各国人民几年来已经对和平贡献出了自己的力量。预订明年4月在阿根廷首都召开的拉丁美洲公众大会，将讨论争取民族主权以及裁军和国际合作等问题。
    印度的雷迪先生说，把侵略军队派到黎巴嫩和约旦去的国家没有权利称做是“自由民主的国家”，他们的军队没有权利到一个需要和平和民族独立的国家，必须制止侵略，必须制止核武器试验和干涉其他国家内政的行为。现在最重要的问题是执行和平共处的五项原则。雷迪说，世界上有了像苏联、中国和印度这样爱好和平的人民，他们同世界各国爱好和平的人民团结在一起，永久的和平一定能在全世界建立起来。
    澳大利亚的哈特利先生说，由于澳大利亚政府对美帝国主义采取卑躬屈膝的态度，澳大利亚领土正被美、英帝国主义用来作为核武器的试验场。澳大利亚人民坚决要求立即停止核武器试验，主张发展国际合作。
    缅甸的吴奥卡塔先生说，毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报的发表，“非常有助于世界和平”。他要求西方国家仿效苏联的榜样，立刻停止核武器试验。
    日本的西园寺公一先生在讲话中代表日本国民衷心感谢大会对即将在东京召开的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会所给予的强有力的支持。他说，亲身体验到原子弹灾难的日本人民，坚决要求西方国家仿效苏联的榜样立即停止核武器试验。我们要同美国及其追随者的帝国主义政策进行坚决斗争。
    会上还宣读了第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取世界裁军大会国际筹备委员会和日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会打来的两份贺电。
    大会最后一致通过了“北京各界人民庆祝裁军和国际合作大会成功及支持第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会会议的决议”。这时，全场掌声雷动，“制止侵略、保卫和平”的口号声此起彼伏，连续不断。（附图片）
