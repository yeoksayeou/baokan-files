Xinhua News Agency, 13th: China's newly trained forty-five mountaineers collectively and safely ascended the main peak of the July 1st Glacier, located in the Qilian Mountains (Nanshan Range) in Gansu Province, at an altitude of 5,100 meters above sea level, on August 10th. The collective ascent of such a peak by forty-five mountaineers is a first for China, and a rare occurrence globally. Among the forty-five team members who reached the summit were four women, setting a new record for women's mountaineering in China.

These forty-five mountaineers were all students of the first national mountaineering training class held in Xiangshan, Beijing, this June. After a month and a half of training in Xiangshan, the training class concluded the first and second phases – physical training and basic mountaineering techniques – and then went to the Shule River and the July 1st Glacier in the Qilian Mountains (Nanshan Range) to begin the third phase (ice and snow operations) of learning.

This group of mountaineers came from all over the country, including soldiers, officers, workers, staff, students, teachers, and high-altitude scientific workers in geology, surveying, geomorphology, and meteorology. After two months of study, they have mastered mountaineering techniques relatively skillfully and have become the backbone for carrying out mass mountaineering activities.

　　爬山运动员的一个新的胜利
　　集体登上七一冰川主峰
    据新华社13日讯　我国新培养的四十五名登山运动员，8月10日集体而安全地登上了甘肃省境内祁连山南山山脉拔海五千一百公尺的七一冰川主峰。像这样四十五名登山队员集体地登上这样的高峰的事情，在我国还是第一次；而在世界上也是少有的。登上主峰的四十五名队员中有四位女同志，她们为我国女子登山运动开创了新纪录。
    这四十五名登山运动员，都是今年6月在北京香山举办的全国第一期登山运动员训练班的学员。训练班在香山经过了一个半月的训练，结束了训练班第一、第二阶段——体能锻炼与登山基本技术的训练以后，就分别去祁连山南山山脉的疏勒河及七一冰川开始了第三阶段（冰雪作业）的学习。
    这一批登山队员来自祖国各地，其中有战士、军官、工人、职员、学生、教员和地质、测绘、地貌、气象等高山科学工作者。他们经过了两个月的学习，已较熟练地掌握了登山技术，成为开展群众性登山运动的骨干力量。
