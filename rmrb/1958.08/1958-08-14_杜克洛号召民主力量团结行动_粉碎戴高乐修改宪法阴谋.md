Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 12th: French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos published an article this morning in "L'Humanité" entitled "Don't Let the Instigators of Civil War Succeed," saying that de Gaulle senses that the situation is developing unfavorably for him. Therefore, he is rushing to hold a referendum ahead of schedule, and his propaganda about the referendum is becoming increasingly characterized by civil war blackmail.

Duclos said: If de Gaulle possessed absolute power, he would abolish the democratic press to conceal the truth, and he would ban the existence of political parties in order to prepare his elections as he pleases. He would grant complete freedom of action to the officers who participated in the coup and the thugs who plan to carry out armed attacks to launch an offensive against workers and democratic forces, but the workers and democratic forces will surely counterattack with the necessary and forceful actions.

Therefore, expressing a negative attitude in the referendum is to safeguard domestic peace. This will make the military rebels understand that their actions will arouse the anger of the people who are determined to defend freedom.

The article concluded by saying that it is necessary to ensure that a negative vote prevails in the September 28 referendum. Workers and republican forces are able and should be victorious. These forces must be united in order to ensure the revival of the Republic, in order to strive for the realization of a policy that gives France a great future, based on respect for democratic freedoms, safeguarding national independence, and striving for peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries, as well as a policy of freedom and progress.

　　杜克洛号召民主力量团结行动
　　粉碎戴高乐修改宪法阴谋
    新华社巴黎12日电　法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛今天早晨在“人道报”上发表的一篇题为“不让内战制造者得逞”的文章说：戴高乐感觉到形势的演变对他不利，因此，急急忙忙地要提前举行全民投票，而且他的关于全民投票的宣传越来越具有内战讹诈的性质。
    杜克洛说：如果戴高乐拥有绝对权力，他就将取消民主报刊以掩盖真相，他就将禁止各党派的存在以便为所欲为地准备自己的选举。他将给予参加政变的军官们和打算进行武装袭击的打手们以完全的行动自由来对工人和民主力量发动进攻，但是，工人和民主力量一定会以必要的有力行动予以反击。
    因此，在全民投票中表示否定态度，这就是维护国内和平，这样就会使军事暴乱分子懂得，他们这种做法会激起决心保卫自由的人民的愤怒。
    文章最后说，必须保证在9月28日的全民投票中表示否定态度取得胜利。工人和共和力量是能够而且应该获得胜利的。必须把这些力量团结起来，以便确保共和国的复兴，以便在尊重民主自由、维护民族独立和争取各国人民的和平和友谊的政策以及自由和进步的政策的基础上，来争取实现使法国有伟大前途的政策。
