Since the establishment of advanced cooperatives in 1956, we have implemented a "small-scale contracting" system among the production teams, which played a role in regulating contradictions between teams and rationally calculating labor remuneration for cooperative members. However, this method soon encountered new contradictions: because the management committee uniformly controlled the labor used by each team, it not only limited the production teams' enthusiasm for cultivating the land, but also led to some production teams cheating on work points, loafing on the job, and forming large groups of idlers. As a result, the production results of each team varied, but the remuneration was the same, leading to significant contradictions between teams. To solve this problem, some advanced cooperatives created a "four-guarantee" award and penalty system: guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing finances, and guaranteeing draught animals. We summarized this experience and vigorously promoted the "four-guarantee" system throughout the province during the 1956 winter rectification campaign. Practice has proved that the "four-guarantee" award and penalty system has played a significant role in establishing production order in cooperatives, adjusting contradictions between teams, implementing the responsibility system, clearly dividing the responsibilities of cooperatives and teams, and stimulating the production enthusiasm of cooperative members. It has promoted the development of production and the consolidation and improvement of cooperatives. However, this system is still fundamentally "payment based on labor," and regardless of the production performance of each team, distribution is carried out according to the number of work points earned. Therefore, for a period of time, cooperative members regarded work points as their "lifeline," emphasizing work over production, and engaging in substandard work practices such as rough plowing, perfunctory weeding, and leaving grain behind during harvesting, which hindered the rapid increase in yields. Some better production teams insisted on quality cultivation and strived to increase production, but during distribution, their income was lower than that of teams with "more work and less production," which was obviously unreasonable. This "payment based on labor" method, although it had reward and penalty systems for overproduction and underproduction, could not resolve the contradiction between teams in terms of remuneration according to labor. This is because the underproduction portion was not fully covered, generally only about 20%. The Fourth Team of the Gongnong Cooperative in Shangzhi County had a low output last year, but after the autumn harvest, the actual income of each laborer was higher than that of the Second Team, which had a higher output. This was because the Fourth Team used more labor and the Second Team used less, and the management committee paid according to labor, not according to output, resulting in a very unreasonable situation. From this, it can be clearly seen that the "four-guarantee" system has significant shortcomings in implementing the principle of remuneration according to labor, which to some extent affected the enthusiasm of cooperative members, created disunity and mutual suspicion between teams, and affected the production teams' enthusiasm for striving to increase grain production.

    Under these circumstances, the Hongxing Cooperative in Huachuan County and the Sheli Cooperative in Acheng County created a new method of "payment based on output" in 1957, that is, calculating the labor remuneration of each team according to the value created by the actual labor of each team. This method thoroughly embodies the principle of "remuneration according to labor, more labor, more reward." Therefore, we universally promoted this system throughout the province in 1958. Currently, about 80% of the cooperatives in the province have adopted this method. It has been welcomed and praised by everyone during its implementation, and its promotion has been rapid and its effects have been significant.

    The "payment based on output" method is as follows: On the basis of rationally adjusting the "four fixings" and determining the overall production plan of the cooperative, the cooperative calculates the net income (i.e., income after deducting investment) of each crop based on the planned output and the amount of labor used, and then calculates how many kilograms of grain (or output value) must be produced in the autumn to earn one work day, as the standard for calculating labor remuneration. At the time of distribution, the cooperative gives the production team the number of workdays equivalent to the actual output of each crop. This method more accurately reflects the value created by each workday. Its calculation is not more complicated than the "four-guarantee" award and penalty system, and its calculation formula is:

    (Crop Target Output - Crop Investment (Converted to Grain)) ÷ Fixed Labor = Output to be Turned in per Workday
    (Crop Actual Output - Crop Actual Investment (Converted to Grain)) ÷ Output to be Turned in per Workday = Workdays Earned by the Production Team
    (Total Income of the Cooperative - Total Expenditure of the Cooperative) ÷ Total Workdays of the Cooperative = Standard Workday Value of the Cooperative
    Standard Workday Value of the Cooperative × Workdays Actually Earned by Each Team = Income of Each Team

    Payment based on output is not only a matter of calculating labor remuneration, but also a major reform of the economic system. In promoting "payment based on output," all localities have rationally handled the following issues based on the principle of benefiting production and combining the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the cooperative members:

    (1) Scope of Payment Based on Output. At present, most cooperatives mainly implement "payment based on output" for agriculture (including grain crops, cash crops, and agricultural by-products) and fixed sideline production. Cooperatives with suitable conditions also implement payment based on output for animal husbandry, forestry, and handicrafts. It seems that the scope of payment based on output should be continuously expanded according to conditions to ensure the comprehensive development and mutual promotion of various rural productions.

    (2) Target Output. The method of setting target output is basically the same as the method of setting target output in the "four-guarantee" system. That is: for each crop, the target output is reasonably evaluated based on soil quality, cultivation conditions, technical measures, etc. There are currently two standards for target output: one is to use the Great Leap Forward plan as the target output, on the grounds that it can ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan; the other is to set it lower than the Great Leap Forward plan and higher than the local average annual output, on the grounds that it is easier for the masses to accept and can encourage cooperative members to overproduce. It seems that if the Great Leap Forward target is advanced and reliable, it is better to adopt the former method. After the target output is set, the output target is generally no longer changed during the normal production process. In the event of natural disasters that are irresistible, the target output can be adjusted according to the actual situation, and the output and quality requirements to be turned in per workday in the autumn harvest will be recalculated.

    (3) Fixed Labor. The method is to calculate the amount of labor used per hectare based on the labor standards and the remuneration standards for each process of each crop, and use it as the fixed labor number per hectare. For land that is far away and requires more labor for cultivation, the number of labor days can be appropriately increased depending on the situation. According to existing experience, it is best to set the fixed labor number somewhat generously so that the production team is not restricted by tight fixed labor in cultivation and processing. The items for fixed labor should generally include: field agricultural labor, fertilizer accumulation labor, miscellaneous labor (labor for delivering purchased grain, labor for raising livestock and chopping grass, and basic construction labor that can be guaranteed, etc.). After the fixed labor is determined, the cooperative will no longer clean up or increase or decrease work processes, except in the case of major natural disasters that require increased or decreased labor. For labor that is uncertain or unexpected, the cooperative can adopt the method of calculating actual expenses and reporting them separately.

    (4) Fixed Investment (i.e., production costs). Mainly includes: seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, livestock feed, agricultural tool repair costs, administrative management fees, etc. These investments are calculated on the average area of cultivated land of the production team to find out the amount of investment per hectare as a fixed quota expenditure. Production teams can expand investment in order to increase production, and the cooperative does not restrict this.

    (5) Calculation Method of Payment Based on Output. There are currently three methods: one is to calculate both grain crops and cash crops based on output; the second is to calculate grain crops based on output and cash crops based on output value; and the third is to calculate both grain crops and cash crops based on output value. It seems that the first two are better, and the third method does not meet the requirement of increasing grain production in every possible way and should not be adopted. After the output calculation, some cooperatives have seen contradictions between teams due to inconsistent grain quality. The experience of the Hongxing Cooperative in Huachuan County in solving this problem is: the quantity of each grade of grain is specified separately in the grain output to be turned in per workday. For example, turning in 95 kilograms of first-grade high-quality grain earns one workday, turning in 100 kilograms of second-grade high-quality grain earns one workday, and turning in 105 kilograms of third-grade grain earns one workday. This method is very good. It pays attention to both the quantity and quality of grain and should be universally promoted.

    (6) The remuneration of cadres also implements "payment based on output." The payment standard is calculated based on the income level of the middle and upper-middle-level labor force in the entire cooperative. As for the excess or reduction after cadres "fix production through labor," it is democratically evaluated by the cooperative members, and rewards and penalties are implemented.

    Practice has proved that payment based on output, because it thoroughly implements the principle of remuneration according to labor, has the following great advantages:

    First, because payment based on output calculates labor remuneration according to the actual grain output completed, the higher the actual output, the more workdays the cooperative members earn. This greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of cooperative members to increase grain production in every possible way and their awareness of being responsible for the quality of field production. The implementation of this system has reversed the psychology of cooperative members emphasizing work over production from the perspective of material distribution, laying a reliable foundation for the implementation of the field production management system. This is the fundamental point that makes "payment based on output" much superior to the four-guarantee award and penalty system. After the Hongxing Cooperative in Huachuan County implemented "payment based on output," cooperative members proactively put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals such as technological reforms and put them into practice. Although 1957 was a 10% better year than 1956 in terms of weather, the actual output of the entire cooperative increased by 65% compared to 1956. Cooperative members said, "In the past, work points were our lifeline, but now grain is our lifeline. No matter how many work points you have, it's useless if you can't produce grain." This proves that the further improvement of the distribution system will bring great promotion to the development of productive forces.

    Second, because "payment based on output" more thoroughly implements the principle of remuneration according to labor and the responsibility system in production, it correspondingly completely solves the contradictions between cooperatives and teams and between teams. Now, teams compete with each other in terms of effort, measures, and output, replacing the past mutual distrust. The relationship between the cooperative and the teams has been replaced by mutual support instead of the past disputes over work points. Due to the enhanced unity, it has also brought favorable conditions for production development.

    Third, it further stimulated the enthusiasm of cooperative members to participate in the management of the cooperative, which laid a good foundation for democratic management. Many cooperatives were unable to implement the responsibility field system last year, but after implementing "payment based on output" this year, they accepted it quickly and implemented it well. They said, "If everyone is not responsible, they will produce less grain. If they produce less grain, they will have less income."

    Fourth, it promoted the improvement of other business management work.

    "Payment based on output" itself includes work in planning management, labor management, and financial management. In particular, because "payment based on output" calculates labor remuneration based on the actual value created by the production team, it prompts the production team to actively improve business management, rationally utilize land, and use labor, livestock, and funds more, better, and more economically. At the same time, the method of payment based on output is carried out under the unified leadership of the cooperative, but there is also appropriate decentralization. It not only gives play to the superiority of the cooperative's centralized and unified management, but also gives play to the initiative and creativity of the production team. Therefore, it is a major reform of the distribution system of agricultural cooperatives, an important aspect of improving socialist relations of production, and a Great Leap Forward in business management.

    Fifth, the "payment based on output" method is simple and easy to implement, which helps to improve the leadership level of the cooperative. After payment based on output, it is generally no longer necessary to clean up and increase or decrease work processes on a quarterly or sectional basis. Cadres can concentrate their energy on grasping some major issues. Cooperative cadres said, "This time, we can delve into the production process and specifically strengthen the leadership of the production team." Production team leaders also feel that their responsibility is heavy, and their work is more proactive and active.

    黑龙江省怎样实行“以产计酬”的
    中共黑龙江省委会
    1956年高级社建成以后，我们在社队之间推行了“小包工”制度，它对调节队与队之间的矛盾、合理计算社员劳动报酬等方面起了一定的作用。但是这个办法行之不久就出现了新的矛盾：由于管委会统一掌握各队用工，不仅限制了生产队对土地加工的积极性，也造成了某些生产队骗取工分，磨洋工，混大帮的现象，结果各队生产效果不一，而报酬相同，队与队之间矛盾很大。有些先进的合作社为了解决这个问题，创造了包工、包产、包财务、包耕畜的四包奖惩制度，我们总结了这个经验，并在1956年冬季整社的时候，在全省范围内大力地推广了“四包”。实践证明，“四包”奖惩制度对于建立合作社的生产秩序，调整队与队之间的矛盾，贯彻责任制，明确划分社、队职责，激发社员生产积极性等方面起了很大作用。它促进了生产的发展和合作社的巩固提高。但是，这个制度基本上还是“以工计酬”的，不分各队生产好坏，一律按照所得工分多少进行分配，因此有个时期社员把工分看成是“命根子”，重工轻产，干起活来只图快，不图好，耕地粗糙，铲趟毛草，割地丢穗等降质偷工现象经常发生，障碍了产量的迅速增加。有些较好的生产队坚持耕作质量，力争增产，可是到分配的时候，反而低于“工多产少”的队的收入，这显然是不合理的。这种“以工计酬”的办法，虽然有超产减产的奖惩制度，但是也不能解决队和队在按劳取酬上的矛盾。这是因为减产部分并不全包，一般只包二成左右。尚志县工农社的第四队，去年产量不高，但秋后分配每个劳动力的实际收入却多于产量高的第二队。这是因为四队用工多，二队用工少，而管委会是按工付酬，不是按产付酬，结果很不合理。由此可以明显看出：“四包”制度，对于贯彻按劳取酬的原则是有很大缺陷的，在一定程度上影响了社员积极性的发挥，造成了队与队之间的不团结和互相猜疑，影响生产队努力增产粮食的积极性。
    在这种情况下，桦川县红星社和阿城县舍利社，在1957年创造了“以产计酬”的新办法，即按各队实际劳动所创造的价值来计算各队劳动报酬。这种办法彻底地体现了“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的原则。因此，我们于1958年在全省范围内普遍推广了这个制度。目前全省已有80％左右的合作社采用了这个办法。推行中人人欢迎，个个称赞，推广迅速、效果明显。
    “以产计酬”的作法是：在合理调整“四固定”和确定全社生产计划的基础上，由合作社根据每种作物的计划产量的纯收入（即扣除了投资的收入）和用工数量，分别作物计算出秋后每生产出多少斤粮食（或产值）即换得一个劳动日，作为计算劳动报酬的标准。到分配的时候，生产队在每种作物上实际完成了多少劳动日的产量，合作社就给生产队多少劳动日。这种办法比较确切地体现出每个劳动日所创造的价值，它并不比“四包”奖惩制度计算复杂，它的计算公式是：
    （作物定产－作物投资（折粮食））÷定工＝每个劳动日应交的产量
    （作物实际产量－作物实际投资（折粮食）÷每个劳动日应交的产量＝生产队应得的劳动日
    （全社总收入－全社总支出）÷全社总劳动日数＝全社标准劳动日值
    全社标准劳动日值×各队实得劳动日＝各队的收入
    以产计酬不仅是劳动报酬的计算方法问题，而是一个重大的经济制度的改革。各地在推行“以产计酬”的工作中，都本着有利于生产，有利于国家、合作社、社员三者利益相结合的原则，合理地处理了如下问题：
    （一）以产计酬的范围。目前一般社主要是实行了农业“以产计酬”（包括粮谷作物、经济作物、农业副产品）和定型的副业生产，有条件的合作社还实行了畜牧业、林业、手工业的以产计酬。看来，以产计酬的范围应当根据条件不断扩大，以保证农村各项生产的全面发展和相互促进。
    （二）定产。定产的方法基本上和“四包”时定产办法相同。即：分别作物，根据土质好坏，耕作条件，技术措施等，合理评定出每种作物的定产指标。定产标准目前有两种：一种是以大跃进计划作为定产指标，理由是可以保证跃进计划的实现；另一种是低于跃进计划，高于当地常年产量，理由是群众易于接受，可以鼓励社员超产。看来如果跃进指标先进可靠，采用前一种办法好一些。定产后的产量指标，在常年生产过程中，一般不再变动，遇到人力不可抗拒的自然灾害时，可根据实际情况调整定产指标，并重新核算秋后每个劳动日应交的产量和质量要求。
    （三）定工。办法是根据每种作物的工序和劳动定额的报酬标准，计算出每垧地的用工数量，作为每垧地的定工数。对于距离较远，耕作费工的土地，可分别情况适当地增加工数。据已有经验，定工时最好定得宽余一些，使生产队在耕作加工上不受定工偏紧的限制。定工的项目一般应当包括：田间农活用工，积肥用工，杂工（送征购粮用工、牲畜饲养和铡草用工以及有把握的基本建设用工等）。定工后，除了遭受很大的自然灾害必须增工减工外，合作社不再进行清理增减工序。对于没有把握或料想不到的用工，可以采用由社单独计算实报实销的办法。
    （四）定投资（即生产费用）。主要包括：籽种、农药、肥料、牲畜饲草饲料，农具修理费，行政管理费等。这些投资按生产队耕地面积平均计算，求出每垧地的投资数，作为定额开支。生产队为了超产可以扩大投资，合作社不加限制。
    （五）以产计酬的计算方法。目前有三种：一是粮食作物与经济作物一律以产量计算；二是粮食作物以产量计算，经济作物以产值计算；三是粮食作物与经济作物一律以产值计算。看来，前两种比较好，第三种办法不符合千方百计增产粮食的要求，不宜采用。以产量计算以后，有的社出现了队与队之间粮食质量不一的矛盾。桦川县红星社解决这个问题的经验是：每个劳动日应交的粮食产量中，分别规定每等粮食的数量。如交一等高粮九十五斤换一个劳动日，交二等高粮一百斤换一个劳动日，交三等一百零五斤粮换一个劳动日，这个办法很好，它既注意了粮食数量又注意了粮食质量，应当普遍推广。
    （六）干部的劳动报酬，也实行了“以产计酬”。付酬标准按全社中上等劳动力收入水平计算。至于干部“定工生产”以后的超过或减少部分由社员民主评议，实行奖惩。
    实践证明：以产计酬，由于它彻底地贯彻了按劳取酬的原则，因此，它具有如下的极大优越性：
    第一、由于以产计酬是按照实际完成的粮食产量来计算劳动报酬，实际产量愈高，社员所得的劳动日就愈多。这就极大地激发了社员千方百计地增产粮食的积极性，和向田间生产质量负责的自觉性。这个制度的实行，从物质分配上扭转了社员重工轻产的心理，为贯彻执行田间生产管理制度打下了可靠基础。这是“以产计酬”比四包奖惩制优越得多的基本点。桦川县红星社实行“以产计酬”以后，社员主动提出技术改革等合理化建议一百多项，并且付诸实现。全社1957年虽然比1956年高一成半年景，但全社实际产量却比1956年增长了65％。社员说：“过去工分是命根，现在粮食是命根，工分再多打不出粮食来也是白搭。”由此证明，分配制度的进一步健全，对生产力的发展会带来巨大的促进作用。
    第二、由于“以产计酬”比较彻底地贯彻了按劳取酬和生产上的责任制，因此相应地彻底解决了社与队之间和队与队之间互相不和的矛盾。现在队与队之间由比干劲、比措施、比产量，代替了过去的互不信任；社、队之间用互相支持代替了过去在工分问题上的争多较少。由于团结的增强，也就给生产发展带来了有利条件。
    第三、进一步激发了社员参加合作社管理的积极性，它给民主办社奠定了一个良好的基础。不少合作社去年搞责任田搞不下去，今年实行“以产计酬”以后接受的快，执行的也好。他们说：“大家再不负责，就要少打粮食了。少打粮食就要少收入。”
    第四、促进了其他经营管理工作的改进。
    “以产计酬”本身就包含着：计划管理、劳动管理、财务管理等方面的工作。特别是由于“以产计酬”是根据生产队实际创造价值来计算劳动报酬的，促使生产队积极改善经营管理，合理利用土地，和更多更好更省地利用劳畜力和资金。同时，以产计酬的办法既是在合作社的统一领导下进行的，又有适当的分散；既发挥了合作社集中统一经营的优越性，又发挥了生产队的主动性和创造性，所以它是农业社分配制度的重大改革，是改进社会主义生产关系的一个重要方面，是经营管理工作的大跃进。
    第五、“以产计酬”办法简便易行，有助于提高合作社的领导水平。以产计酬后，一般地不用再按季按段的清理和增减工序了，干部可以集中精力多抓一些重大问题。社干部说：“这回可以深入生产过程，具体地加强生产队的领导了。”生产队长也感到责任重大，工作更主动更积极了。
