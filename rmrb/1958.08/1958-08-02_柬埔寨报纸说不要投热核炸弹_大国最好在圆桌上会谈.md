Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 1st. “Cambodian Telegram” published an editorial today supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit meeting of government leaders.

The newspaper wrote: "Khrushchev truly demonstrated his goodwill, which surprised Western countries and put them in an embarrassing situation."

The newspaper said that for Cambodians, "we firmly support the convening of a top-level meeting, because facts have proved that direct diplomacy through personal contact has repeatedly achieved satisfactory results. Major powers are better off meeting at a round table than dropping thermonuclear bombs!"
