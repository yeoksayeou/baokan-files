Mr. President:

I am extremely indignant at your letter of June 1st. You avoided answering the questions I raised in my letter of April 23rd, and instead continued to employ despicable tactics of reversing black and white, and confusing right and wrong. You wantonly slandered and threatened the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) and myself personally, and shamelessly defended your reactionary behavior. This thoroughly exposes you as a faithful pawn deliberately serving the political conspiracy of creating "two Chinas" for American imperialism.

A person like you, who has tarnished the Olympic spirit and violated the Olympic Charter, is no longer qualified to serve as the President of the International Olympic Committee. All those who are loyal to the Olympic spirit will oppose your shameful behavior.

I have worked with other fellow members of the International Olympic Committee for many years, jointly contributing to the international Olympic movement and establishing good friendships. But it pains me to see that today the International Olympic Committee is controlled by an imperialist like you, and the Olympic spirit has been completely trampled upon. In order to safeguard the Olympic spirit and tradition, I formally declare that I refuse to cooperate with you and refuse to have any contact with the International Olympic Committee controlled by you.

							Dong Shouyi

　　董守义致国际奥委会主席函主席先生：
    你6月1日的来信使我感到非常愤慨。你对我4月23日去信中所提出的责问避不答复，却继续施展颠倒黑白、混淆是非的卑鄙伎俩，对中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）和我个人肆意污蔑和威胁，并且无耻地为你的反动行为辩护。这就彻底暴露了你是一个蓄意为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋效劳的忠实走卒。
    像你这样沾污奥林匹克精神、破坏奥林匹克宪章的人已经没有任何资格担任国际奥委会的主席。所有忠于奥林匹克精神的人，都会反对你的可耻行为。
    我和国际奥委会的其他委员同事多年，共同为国际奥林匹克运动作出了贡献，并且建立了良好的友谊。但是令我痛心的是今天国际奥委会操纵在像你这样的一个帝国主义分子手中，奥林匹克精神已经被蹂躏无遗。为了维护奥林匹克的精神和传统，我正式申明拒绝同你合作，拒绝同你所把持的国际奥委会发生任何联系。
                                                董守义
                                            1958年8月19日
