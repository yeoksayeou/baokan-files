Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 13th: The newly built Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 coke oven produced its first batch of coke at 11:50 PM on the 12th. By 8:00 AM on the 13th, it had produced thirteen batches. Once production adjustments are normalized, this modern coke oven will produce a batch of coke every nine minutes and will operate continuously for thirty years without major overhaul.

This large coke oven, designed with the help of the Soviet Union, began loading coal for coking on the 11th. Coal-carrying trains arrived at the unloading point, where a cradle-shaped tippler clamped onto the train car and flipped it over, dumping the coal into an underground coal bunker more than ten meters deep. Then, the coal passed through underground and overhead belt corridors to be coarsely crushed and then sent to fourteen huge cylindrical coal blending tanks. Here, coals with different properties from various regions were blended in a certain proportion by a coal blending disc, then sent for pulverization, and then transported to the 40-plus-meter-high coal storage tower above the coke oven via a long overhead belt corridor. In this several-li-long coal supply system, including transportation and operation, everything was controlled by electricity, with only a few workers nearby overseeing the normal operation of the machines. After the coal in the storage tower was sent into the coke oven by a charging car and baked for fifteen hours, it solidified into high-quality coke.

On the evening of the 12th, when the moment arrived for the first batch of coke to be discharged, a whistle sounded above the oven, and the coke pushing machine in front of the oven pushed the coke out of the oven and into the quenching car. The glowing coke instantly illuminated half the sky. The quenching car quickly drove to the quenching tower, and underground water sprayed down like a torrential rain. A thick white smoke immediately billowed from the top of the tower, extinguishing the flames of the coke. At this time, the workers picked out a few pieces of coke to report the good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and to the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee.

The early commissioning of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 coke oven not only created conditions for Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 blast furnace to produce iron ahead of schedule on October 1st, but also allowed it to supply some coke to nearby small blast furnaces. This coke oven was originally planned to be completed by the end of this year. Later, in order to produce iron ahead of schedule, Wuhan Iron and Steel decided to complete and put this project into production on September 1st. At that time, some journalists from capitalist countries who were interviewing at the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site simply did not believe that they could produce coke on September 1st, thinking they were exaggerating. However, eight thousand coke oven builders automatically put forward the slogan of "Hard Work for a Hundred Days, Coke Oven to Smoke," fighting against wind and rain, fighting against the scorching sun, and finding ways to overcome various technical difficulties, so that many construction projects were completed ahead of schedule. On June 1st, when the coke oven began to be heated up, there was no gas available, and it had to be baked by manually adding coal. This coincided with the summer season in Wuhan, and the temperature next to the oven reached fifty or sixty degrees Celsius. However, the oven heating workers proposed, "The weather is hot, but not hotter than the coke oven; no matter how hot the coke oven is, it's not as hot as the fiery hearts of our workers." They wore canvas clothes as thick as copper coins in the hot weather and persisted at the side of the oven for seventy consecutive days, raising the temperature inside the oven to nine hundred and fifty degrees, meeting the requirements for coking. Due to the workers' soaring enthusiasm, the No. 1 coke oven was finally put into production nineteen days ahead of the Great Leap Forward plan. (Attached picture)

    武钢一号焦炉提前出焦
　　这座现代化焦炉每隔九分多钟出一炉焦，连续生产三十年不要大修
    新华社武汉13日电　新建武钢一号焦炉在12日夜十一点五十分钟炼出了第一炉焦炭，到13日上午八点，已出了十三炉。当生产调整正常后，这座现代化焦炉就将每隔九分多钟出一炉焦，连续生产三十年都不要大修。
    这座由苏联帮助我国设计的大焦炉，是从11日开始装煤炼焦的。运煤的火车开到卸煤地点，摇篮形状的翻车机便箝住车皮翻个滚儿，将煤倒入十多公尺深的地下煤仓。接着，这些煤便通过地下和空中的皮带通廊，被送去粗破碎，再送入十四个巨大的圆柱形配煤罐。在这里，来自各地的性能不同的煤，由配煤盘按一定的比例配合好，又送去粉碎，并通过长长的高空皮带通廊，送到焦炉上的四十多公尺高的贮煤塔。在这数里长的供煤系统中，包括运输和操作，全由电力控制，只有少数工人在旁边招呼机器正常运行。贮煤塔里的煤由装煤车送进焦炉后，经过十五小时的烧炼，便结成了质量优良的焦炭。
    12日晚上，当第一炉焦出焦的时刻到来时，炉上的哨声一响，炉前的推焦机便将焦炭推出炉外，倒入消火车，冒着火光的焦炭顿时映红了半个天空。消火车载着焦炭迅速开到消火塔下，地下水便像暴雨般喷射下来，塔顶上也立即冒起一阵浓烈的白色烟雾，焦炭的火焰便被扑灭。这时，工人们拣出几块焦炭来，准备向党中央和毛主席报喜，向中共湖北省委和武汉市委报喜。
    武钢一号焦炉提前投入生产，不仅为武钢一号高炉提前在10月1日出铁创造了条件，而且还能将一部分焦炭供应附近的小型高炉。这座焦炉原计划在今年年底建成，后来武钢为了提前出铁，又决定这个工程在9月1日竣工生产。当时，到武钢工地采访的一些资本主义国家的记者，根本不相信他们能在9月1日出焦，认为他们说大话。但是，八千名焦炉建设者自动提出“苦战百天，焦炉冒烟”的行动口号，同风雨搏斗，同烈日搏斗，并设法克服了各种技术困难，使许多个工程项目都提前完成。6月1日，当焦炉开始烘炉时，没有煤气用，必须用人工加煤烘烤。这时正遇上武汉的暑季，炉旁温度达摄氏五、六十度。但烘炉工人们提出“天气热，热不过焦炉；焦炉再热，热不过我们工人的火热的心”。他们就在暑天里穿着铜钱厚的帆布衣服，一连在炉边坚持了七十天，使炉内温度上升到九百五十度，达到了炼焦的要求。由于职工们的这种冲天干劲，终于使一号焦炉比跃进计划提前了十九天投入生产。（附图片）
