Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Under the occupation of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the Matsu Islands of Fujian Province have become a living hell. Chiang Kai-shek's troops commit outrages and oppress the people on the islands.

According to news from Matsu, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have implemented a cruel warlord rule in the villages of the Matsu Islands. The Chiang Kai-shek Matsu Garrison Area has established a so-called "Political Affairs Committee" as an administrative body for Chiang Kai-shek's troops to enslave the people of Matsu. The heads of villages and village chiefs in Matsu are also held by Chiang Kai-shek military officers as full-time or deputy positions, wielding actual power. One of the "achievements" of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the Matsu Islands is the seizure of a large number of civilian houses and arable land for the construction of fortifications and designation as restricted areas, or for cultivation by Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, engaging in so-called "overcoming difficulties production." After a large amount of farmland of the Matsu people was seized by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the area of cultivated land was greatly reduced, affecting grain production, and the lives of farmers became more difficult. Chiang Kai-shek's troops also imposed many harsh restrictions on Matsu fishermen going out to sea to fish, and the fish caught were plundered by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the name of "military fish supply." Fishermen generally do not have enough to eat or wear. In order to ease the resistance of the people of Matsu, the Political Affairs Committee of the Chiang Kai-shek Matsu Garrison Area issued empty promises such as "Guidance Plan for Unemployed Fishermen to Find Employment and Production" and "Strengthening Relief for Starving People," but they were never implemented.

In the name of "supporting the military," in addition to arresting many young and middle-aged people in Matsu and putting them into Chiang Kai-shek's army barracks, Chiang Kai-shek's troops also forcibly organized the old, weak, women, and children into "Civil Defense Teams," "Stretcher Teams," "Women's Teams," etc., and drove them to accept military training and exercises from Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and to build fortifications for Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

The morale of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Matsu is declining day by day. The Chiang Kai-shek command is therefore constantly shouting so-called "strengthening the spiritual arming of officers and soldiers" and formulating many tricks. The Chiang gang is also stepping up the use of pornography to anesthetize Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers. In addition to setting up more military brothels in places like Beigan Tang, making batches of wives and daughters of Chiang Kai-shek military officers who died and Taiwanese women fall into the fire pit and be ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers, the Chiang gang's Ministry of National Defense also lured some young women to form so-called "Young Women's Service Teams," asking them to go to Chiang Kai-shek's companies and bunkers to sing reactionary and erotic songs.

Whether they are Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers whose homes are on the mainland or in Taiwan, they are generally infected with homesickness. A Chiang Kai-shek non-commissioned officer wrote in his diary: "When I stand on the sentry post on the hilltop, looking at the hazy hometown on the opposite shore, there is a kind of inexplicable nostalgia. As long as the corpse can float back to the mainland, it is worth dying." Another Chiang Kai-shek junior officer wrote in his notes: "When I suffer rude insults in the army, and there is nowhere to vent my full of pain, and I have to swallow my tears into my stomach, Mom! I miss you! When I groan in bed, entangled by illness and dying, dreamily shouting Mom, or my tongue is dry and I desperately want to drink a mouthful of boiled water but can't get it, Mom! I miss you!" Feelings like these that reveal dissatisfaction and homesickness are quite common among Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers.

### 蒋军官兵胡作非为欺压百姓  马祖列岛成了人间地狱

    蒋军官兵胡作非为欺压百姓
    马祖列岛成了人间地狱
    新华社8日讯  在蒋军盘踞下的福建省马祖列岛，已经成为人间地狱。蒋军官兵在岛上胡作非为，欺压百姓。
    据来自马祖方面的消息说，蒋军对马祖列岛各乡村实行了残酷的军阀统治，由蒋军马祖守备区设立了一个所谓“政务委员会”，作为蒋军奴役马祖人民的行政机构。马祖各乡村的乡长和村长，也都由蒋军军官担任正职或副职，掌握实际权力。蒋军在马祖列岛的“政绩”之一是霸占了大批民房和耕地，用来构筑工事和划作禁区，或者由蒋军士兵霸耕，搞所谓“克难生产”。马祖人民大批农田被蒋军霸占后，耕地面积大减，影响粮食生产，农民生活更加困苦。蒋军对马祖渔民出海捕鱼也订出了许多苛刻的限制，捕得的鱼又被蒋军以“军鱼供应”的名义加以掠夺。渔民普遍吃不饱穿不暖。为了缓和马祖人民的反抗情绪，蒋军马祖守备区政务委员会曾开出“辅导失业渔民就业生产计划”、“加强救济饥民”等空头支票，但始终没有实施。
    在“支援军事”的名义下，蒋军除了把马祖的许多青壮年抓入蒋军兵营以外，还把老弱妇孺强迫编组为“民防队”、“担架队”、“妇女队”等等，驱押他们接受蒋军的军事训练和演习，并且替蒋军修筑防御工事。
    马祖蒋军的士气日益消沉，蒋军指挥部为此天天嘶喊所谓“强化官兵精神武装”并制订了许多花招。蒋帮还加紧利用色情来麻醉蒋军官兵，除了在北竿塘等地增设军妓院，使成批死亡了的蒋军军官的妻女和台湾妇女堕入火坑，被蒋军官兵蹂躏以外，蒋帮国防部还诱骗了一些青年妇女，编组成所谓“女青年服务队”，要她们到蒋军连队和碉堡中去，演唱反动的和色情的歌曲。
    不论是家在大陆或台湾的蒋军官兵，都普遍染上了思乡病。一个蒋军士官在日记中写道：“当我站在山头的哨位，眼望着对岸迷迷茫茫的故乡时，有一股难以解释的怀念之情。只要尸首能飘回大陆，死了也值得。”另一个蒋军下级军官的笔记中写着：“当我在军中遭受无礼的侮辱，满腔的痛苦无处倾诉，眼泪不得不向肚里咽的时候，妈妈啊！我想起了你！当我呻吟床第，被病魔缠绕得奄奄一息，梦呓地喊妈妈，或舌敝唇焦，酷望喝口开水而不得的时候，妈妈啊！我想起了你！”像这类流露不满和思念家乡的感情，在蒋军官兵中相当普遍。
