Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 4th: All newspapers in the Indian capital today published the news of the meeting between Comrade Khrushchev and Chairman Mao Zedong on the front page with large headlines. These newspapers also published the full text of the communiqué and photographs of Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev.

The headlines emphasized "U.S. and British aggression in West Asia condemned," "Jointly demand a top-level conference," "Demand withdrawal of troops from Jordan and Lebanon," and "Chinese and Soviet leaders praised India's efforts in the struggle for world peace." All India Radio has broadcast the news of the meeting multiple times since yesterday.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 3rd: The Indian press welcomes the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union. After All India Radio broadcast the news of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev this afternoon, passengers on buses were talking loudly about the news.

Because today is Sunday, official reactions are not yet available, but journalists have already begun to comment on the news with great pleasure.

Journalists said that the communiqué "is a remarkable, unexpected, and the biggest news in the world." They believe that "this is the most important guarantee for world peace at present."

An Indian journalist said that during the Suez War, the Soviet Union's warning stopped the imperialist aggression against Egypt. Now the joint warning of China and the Soviet Union has certainly dealt a fatal blow to the U.S. and British aggression in West Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 4th: Indonesian newspapers today published the full text or detailed summaries of the communiqué of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev, which was released yesterday, in prominent positions on the front page.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial today saying that the communiqué of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev is the most severe warning to the U.S. and British imperialists who are setting fires in the Middle East.

The newspaper said: The imperialists have brazenly trampled on the rights of the people of Lebanon and Jordan, so they must swallow this bitter pill that the world condemns.

The "People's Daily" said that the current situation faced by the imperialists is: "Advance and collapse; retreat and fail."

The "People's Daily" said that the communiqué of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev made a correct assessment of the current situation. The communiqué has made a great contribution to preventing war and defending world peace, forcing the imperialists to think twice when setting fires, and also strengthening the ranks of our invincible peace forces.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: TASS Colombo reported: All Sinhalese, Tamil, and English morning newspapers in Ceylon today published the news of the meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong in large headlines on the front page.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: According to TASS Tokyo, August 4th: Japanese newspapers today published the communiqué of the meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong on the front page.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" wrote that it can be seen from the communiqué that China and the Soviet Union are paying special attention to the issue of maintaining peace. In this sense, this communiqué can be called a "new declaration of peace."

"Sankei Jiji" said that the Soviet Union and China called for a peaceful solution to the military conflict in the Middle East. The newspaper said that this is very significant at present, because the international situation has been greatly sharpened due to the interference of the United States and Britain in Middle Eastern affairs.

"Tokyo Shimbun" pointed out that the Soviet Union and China reiterated that peaceful coexistence must be implemented on the basis of the famous Five Principles.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, August 4th: Karachi newspapers today published the news of the meeting between Khrushchev and Chairman Mao on the front page. Some newspapers also published photos of the two leaders.

    报纸的标题强调“美英在西亚的侵略受到谴责”、“共同要求召开最高级会议”、“要求从约旦和黎巴嫩撤军”、“中苏领导人赞扬印度在争取世界和平方面所作的努力”。全印广播电台从昨天起多次广播会谈的消息。

    报界人士说，这个公报“是引人注目的、出人意料的、世界上最大的消息”。他们认为“这是目前世界和平最重要的保证”。

    这家报纸说：帝国主义者蛮横地蹂躏黎巴嫩和约旦人民的权利，因此，他们必须吞下全世界加以谴责的这一丸苦药。
    “人民日报”说，目前帝国主义所面临的形势是：“前进则崩溃；后退则失败”。
    “人民日报”说，毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报对目前局势作了正确的估计。公报在防止战争和保卫世界和平方面作出了巨大的贡献，使得帝国主义者在放火时不得不作再三的考虑，同时也加强了我们的不可战胜的和平力量的队伍。
