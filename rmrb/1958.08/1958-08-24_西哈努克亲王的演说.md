Prince Sihanouk's Speech

I have been invited to speak at this meeting, which brings together representatives elected by the people of the whole country, which is a great honor for me and for Cambodia. I would like to express my deep gratitude to you and ask you to excuse me for taking up some of your valuable time.

Here, I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my warm gratitude to the Chinese people and the Chinese government for their formal invitation, and to reiterate how moved I was by the brotherly and grand reception accorded to the Cambodian national delegation.

This visit by our delegation is of particularly great significance. It truly marks a decisive stage in the relationship between our two countries, our two governments, and our two peoples. Upon our arrival in Beijing, I already pointed out that the relationship between China and Cambodia is not newly established. More than a thousand years ago, your country's travelers and merchants had already reached our ancient capital of Angkor, and on the other hand, our Buddhist monks had also gone to China to translate and annotate our Buddhist scriptures. Many of your compatriots have settled in Cambodia, where they have married and had offspring. Now they number over 300,000.

Later, we suffered centuries of disaster and foreign aggression, allowing us only to survive. But since the great liberation movements allowed Asian countries to gain complete national sovereignty, the natural relations between our two countries have been restored.

During the Bandung Asian-African Conference in 1955, China and Cambodia reunited, where I first met with Premier Zhou Enlai, and we immediately and completely agreed to lay the initial foundation for our future relations. We, the Cambodian people, find it very easy to understand that our small country can and should coexist fraternally with the new China, and at the outset we were instinctively aware of this.

The stage of establishing normal relations between our two countries has been swiftly traversed. After the Bandung Conference, I visited Beijing in 1956, and Premier Zhou Enlai visited Cambodia a few months later. You have provided our country with economic assistance, and cultural and trade exchanges between our two countries have developed in an atmosphere of full trust. The final result is the establishment of normal diplomatic relations and the mutual dispatch of the highest-level representatives, which is the natural outcome of coexisting in strict adherence to the principles of friendship, peace, and non-interference. The exchange of ambassadors between our two countries is merely a resumption of a thousand-year tradition, as we cannot forget that the Kingdom of Cambodia established embassies with China before establishing embassies with other countries.

It is truly encouraging to see that two countries as different in population and area, and with different systems, as Cambodia and China, can coexist and cooperate. In today's world, where moral principles are trampled upon, where might makes right, and where only strong countries are respected, such examples are rare. Big countries accuse each other of colonialism, small countries live in terror, and it is difficult for them to escape the cruel consequences caused by the quarrels of big countries.

In this regard, Cambodia is quite fortunate. Thanks to the unity of the people around the King, who is less an authoritarian monarch than a benevolent and generous father, and thanks to the determination of all Cambodians to die rather than give up their honor, we have maintained our country's independence, national sovereignty, and freedom of action in domestic and foreign affairs, which is to say, we have maintained our neutrality.

However, our peaceful country has not been spared threats, coercion, and encroachment, especially being accused of being a "fake" neutral country. Moreover (why hide it?), we also fear that the world will think that our neutrality is not real, not sincere, or that despite our good intentions, we cannot make others respect our declared neutrality.

Cambodia is only a tiny dot on the world map; our borders have no protection from any natural barriers, and in particular we are surrounded by countries with opposing and hostile ideologies. We can say without exaggeration that our existence as an independent country is precisely due to neutrality, because neutrality removes the pretext from those who are ready to seize any opportunity to attack us, conquer us, and invade us. Now it is not difficult for us to understand why the Cambodian people are so determined and persistent in maintaining neutrality, and will never give it up, no matter what the cost.

Of course, foreign aid is precious to us, and we thank all countries that sincerely help us, but if they want to withdraw their aid, we do not think that we will not be able to survive. If this happens, we will only have to endure greater sacrifices in order to survive as a nation. The Cambodian people will never skimp on this sacrifice if they see their neutrality and independence threatened.

The neutrality as we understand it is: to treat and view all countries equally, regardless of their social systems; to treat all major countries equally, whether they are Eastern, Western, or neutral countries. A neutral position requires us to maintain complete balance between all countries, resisting all pressure, without fear or retreat.

Some small countries have chosen the path of attaching themselves to a certain group, from which they receive huge amounts of aid to support their dilapidated finances and economy. These countries look at our poverty with pity, advising us to be aware of the weakness of our national power, and blaming us for pursuing policies that are flashy and unrealistic and for currying favor with strong countries to obtain relief.

They should know that we are a people with a relatively long culture and a proud character, and we are unwilling to exchange honor for material wealth. This noble quality is recorded in our history, our monuments, and our cultural history. In this twentieth century, compared to modern countries, we are aware of our "weakness," and our only ambition is to maintain the property left to us by our ancestors and to ensure the peace and prosperity of our small country.

As for our relations with big countries, we insist that these relations should be established on an equal footing in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. But the whole world knows that we have never imagined playing a role in the international or world arena that is disproportionate to our weak strength. My visits to the capitals of major powers are not, as some criticize us, out of pursuit of glory and hubris, but primarily to seek the welfare of the country in a spirit of realism that is beneficial to our people and our country.

In his speech at the welcoming meeting of our parliament, Premier Zhou Enlai mentioned great-power chauvinism and stated that China is willing to treat all countries equally. From the relationship between the new China and Cambodia, we can see that the new China does not indeed have chauvinism. I believe that this sincere attitude towards our country will restore confidence to those small countries that now have a certain sense of inferiority when dealing with big countries.

That is why we also believe that the new China should have its due place in important international organizations and international conferences, because in today's world, without the participation of your great country and its 650 million people, it is clearly impossible to achieve any solid and lasting results. In this regard, I am referring in particular to the peace that the people of the world urgently demand and the cessation of the cold war that has opened up an era of pain, poverty, and death for our poor generation of mankind.

Leap-forward development has enabled China to join the ranks of world powers in just a few years, while other countries have taken centuries of effort to achieve this. But, even more noteworthy is that, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, due to the Chinese people's desire for peace, China has been playing an important role in the life of the Asian-African family since the Bandung Conference.

China is playing a role in defending world peace and the independence of the Asian-African people, which is undeniable because it is a fact acknowledged by all countries. However, if China is not recognized in law, then the Asian-African problem can never find a just, necessary, and definite solution, and this is regrettable. We are very clearly aware that any major international conference without China's participation is unlikely to produce any results in its discussions, and therefore we cannot but emphasize this point.

Mr. Chairman, the new relationship between Cambodia and China foreshadows that the cooperation between our two countries will produce rich fruits. This relationship gives the Cambodian people more reason to look forward to the future with greater confidence. Therefore, gentlemen, as I conclude my speech, I would like to express to you that my visit to China is a friendly gesture, and at the same time this visit shows our confidence and hope in a sincere attitude that will help solve international problems.

Glory belongs to the eternal friendship between our two countries!

Long live the Chinese people! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 西哈努克亲王的演说

　　西哈努克亲王的演说
    我被邀请在这个集中了全国人民所选举的代表的会议上讲话，这对于我和柬埔寨是莫大的光荣。我谨向你们表示深切的感谢，并且请你们原谅我花费你们一些宝贵的时间。
    在这里，我愿通过你们再一次对中国人民和中国政府的正式邀请表示热烈的谢意，并且再一次告诉你们，对柬埔寨国家代表团所受到的兄弟般的盛大的接待我是多么感动。
    我们代表团的这次访问具有特别重大的意义。它确实标志着我们两国、我们两国政府和我们两国人民之间的关系中的一个决定性的阶段。在我们到达北京的时候，我已经指出，中国和柬埔寨的关系并不是新近才建立起来的。一千多年以前，贵国旅行者和商人已经到达我国的古都吴哥，另一方面，我们的佛教高僧也曾到中国去，在那里翻译和注释我们的佛经。你们有许多同胞在柬埔寨定居下来，在那里结婚和生育了后代。现在他们已经有三十万人以上了。
    以后，我们遭受了几世纪的灾难和外国侵略，使我们仅仅能够生存下来。但是自从伟大的解放运动使亚洲各国获得完全的国家主权以来，我们两国的自然的关系得到了恢复。
    1955年万隆亚非会议期间，中国和柬埔寨重新会面了，在那里我第一次同周恩来总理先生会晤，而且我们立即完全一致地为我们的未来关系奠定了初步的基础。我们柬埔寨人民十分容易理解，我们这个小国能够而且应该同新中国兄弟般地共处，而在开初我们是直觉地意识到这一点的。
  我们两国建立正常关系的阶段已经迅速地越过了。万隆会议以后，我在1956年访问了北京，几个月以后周恩来总理访问了柬埔寨。你们对我国提供了经济援助，我们两国之间的文化和贸易往来在充分信任的气氛中发展了起来，最后达到的结果就是建立了正常的外交关系和互派最高级的代表，这是在严格遵守友好、和平和互不干涉诸原则的情况下共处的自然的结果。我们两国互派大使只不过是重续千年来的传统，因为我们不能够忘记，柬埔寨王国是在和其他国家互设大使馆之前，先和中国互设大使馆的。
    看到像柬埔寨和中国这样两个人口和面积悬殊、制度不同的国家能够共处和合作，真使我们感到振奋。在现在的世界上，在道义原则受到蹂躏，有强权无公理，只有强国才受到尊重的情况下，这样的例子是罕见的。大国以殖民主义相互指责，小国处在恐怖之中，而且难以幸免大国争吵所引起的残酷的后果。
    在这方面柬埔寨是相当幸运的。由于全国人民团结在与其说是一个极权君主，不如说是一个仁慈宽洪的家长的国王的周围，由于全体柬埔寨人民具有宁死也不放弃他们的荣誉的决心，我们维护了我国的独立、民族主权和内政外交的行动自由，这就是说，我们维护了我国的中立。
    但是我们这个和平的国家并没有因此而免受威胁、强迫和蚕食，特别是被人加以“假”中立国的罪名。而且（何必隐瞒呢？）我们也怕全世界会认为我们的中立不是真的，不是真诚的，或者尽管我们有良好的意愿，我们却不能使别人尊重我们所宣布的中立。
    柬埔寨在世界地图上只不过是微小的一点；我们的边界没有任何天然屏障的保护，尤其是我们被一些具有相反的和敌对的意识形态的国家所包围着。我们可以毫不夸大地说，我国作为一个独立的国家而存在，恰恰要归功于中立，因为中立使我们解除了那些准备抓住一切机会来攻击我们、征服我们和侵略我们的人的借口。现在我们不难明白，柬埔寨人民为什么如此坚决和顽强地保持中立，无论可以得到什么代价也决不予以放弃。
    当然，外国援助对我们是珍贵的，我们感谢一切真诚援助我们的国家，但是如果他们想撤回他们的援助，我们并不认为这样一来我们就会活不下去。一旦发生这种情况，我们只有忍受更大的牺牲以求得我们国家的生存。柬埔寨人民决不会吝惜这种牺牲，如果他们看到他们的中立和独立受到威胁的话。
   我们所理解的中立是：一视同仁地对待和看待所有国家，不论其社会制度如何；对于所有的主要国家，不论它是东方国家、西方国家或者中立国家，一律同等看待。中立地位要求我们在一切国家之间保持完全的平衡，抗拒一切压力，毫不畏缩，毫不退让。
    某些小国选择了依附某一集团的道路，从这个集团得到巨额援助以支持它们的雕敝的财政和经济。这些国家带着悲天悯人的眼光看待我们的贫困，劝我们要对国力的软弱有自知之明，而且责备我们执行着华而不实的政策和讨好强国以取得周济。
    他们应该知道，我们是一个具有相当悠久的文化和自豪性格的人民，我们不愿以荣誉来换取物资财富。这种高贵的品质是记载在我们的历史、我们的古迹和我们的文化史上。在这二十世纪的年代里，同现代国家相形之下，我们意识到自己的“软弱”，我们唯一的雄心，就是维护祖先遗留给我们的财产，保证我们这个小国的和平和繁荣。
    至于我们同大国的关系，我们坚持这种关系应该按照联合国宪章的精神建立在平等的基础上。但是全世界都知道，我们从没有妄想在国际或世界范围内起一个和我们微弱的力量不相称的作用。我到各大国首都进行访问，并非像有些人责难我们的，是出于追求光荣和夜郎自大，而首先是本着有利于我们人民和国家的现实主义精神来谋求国家的福利。
    周恩来总理在我国议会欢迎会上的演说中，曾经提到大国沙文主义，并且表示中国愿意对所有国家一视同仁。从新中国同柬埔寨的关系中，我们可以看到新中国的确没有沙文主义。我相信，对于我国的这种真诚的态度将会使那些现在和大国相处时具有某种自卑感的小国重新获得信心。
    这就是为什么我们也认为新中国在重要的国际组织和国际会议中应该得到它应有的地位，因为在现在的世界中，如果没有你们这个大国和它的六亿五千万人民的参加，显然是不可能有任何稳固的和持久的建树的。在这方面，我所指的特别是全世界人民所迫切要求的和平以及停止为我们这一代可怜的人类开辟了痛苦、贫困和死亡的纪元的冷战。
    飞跃发展的建设使中国在短短几年之内跻身于世界强国之林，而别的国家却是经过几世纪的努力才达到这一步的。但是，更值得注意的是，在毛泽东主席的领导下，由于中国人民的和平意愿，从万隆会议以来中国就在亚非大家庭的生活中起着重要的作用。
    中国起着保卫世界和平和亚非人民的独立的作用，这是不容置疑的，因为这是所有国家所默认的事实。然而，如果不在法律上承认中国，那末亚非问题就决不可能找到公正的，必需的，确定不移的解决办法，而这是令人遗憾的。我们十分清楚地意识到，凡是没有中国参加的重大的国际会议，其讨论是不可能产生任何结果的，因此我们不能不着重指出这一点。
    主席先生，柬埔寨和中国之间的新的关系预示着我们两国的合作将产生丰富的成果。这种关系，使柬埔寨人民更有理由以更大的信心瞻望未来。因此，各位先生，在我结束演说的时候，我要向各位表示，我到中国进行访问是一种友好的表示，同时这次访问又显示着我们对于有助于解决国际问题的真诚态度抱有信心和希望。
    光荣属于我们两国之间的永恒的友谊！
    中国人民万岁！　（新华社）
