    Xinhui County is located in the southwest of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong. It is a relatively affluent area, mainly producing grain, with a relatively developed economic crop sector. The county seat is located in Huicheng Town. Huicheng Town is located in the north-central part of the county, with an urban area of 2.3 square kilometers and a current population of over 34,000 people.

    Huicheng is a very old town. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it had a population of 120,000 and nearly 10,000 houses. Due to the Japanese imperialist invasion and the Kuomintang's cruel rule, this county town suffered severe damage. By 1949, the population had dropped to just over 27,000, of whom over 8,000 were unemployed. More than one-third of the houses had been destroyed. The whole city was full of rubble and dangerous walls, dilapidated houses and temples, garbage and feces everywhere, and swarms of mosquitoes and termites. All the large and small channels were blocked, sewage flowed everywhere, the stench was overwhelming, and diseases were rampant. At that time, people said that Huicheng had "many excesses": "Too much bankruptcy and unemployment, too much theft, too many beggars, too many prostitutes, too much garbage, too many mosquitoes, too many opium addicts and gamblers, too many broken bricks and tiles, too many epidemics, too many deaths."

    Now, Huicheng has completely changed. Here, more than a dozen factories have been built, and unemployment has been eliminated throughout the town. Everyone has a job, and no household is idle. On the basis of production development, urban construction has also developed rapidly. In recent years, new buildings such as the People's Auditorium, People's Hospital, Department Store, Workers' Cultural Palace, People's Cultural Center, Exhibition Hall, Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Nursery, and Kindergarten have appeared successively. All the old sewers have been cleaned up, more than 100 new open channels have been built, more than 300 meters of new sewers have been rebuilt, and 5,000 meters of new concrete roads have been rebuilt. A large-scale People's Park has been built on the ruins of more than 1,000 acres in the north of the city. The park has one high-level, one primary-level, and one children's swimming pool, a zoo with more than 40 kinds of birds, beasts, and amphibians, a scenic lake for tourists to boat on, a children's playground, eight pavilions of various styles, and various kinds of fruit trees, ornamental trees, flower beds, and nurseries. Forty-seven small gardens have been built on the rubble fields between the streets throughout the city. Rows of green trees and fragrant flowers line the streets, making it a beautiful county town in southern China.

        Five Viewpoints, One Method

    The county committee's leadership over Huicheng's construction work, like its leadership over other work, focuses on educating cadres on five viewpoints (production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, class viewpoint, diligence and thrift viewpoint, dialectical viewpoint) and one method (the working method of the mass line), so that cadres understand how to give play to people's initiative, and how to use active people to transform all passive things into active things for construction.

    The people have many ideas about building their own city. Workers often say, "There's nowhere to go after work, it would be great to have a park." Young people and adults like swimming, and many people hope to have a swimming pool. Everyone likes to watch plays and wants the county to build a theater. Children also want a playground. These demands of the people are all justifiable.

    When the county committee proposed to build Huicheng into a beautiful socialist city, many cadres and the masses lacked confidence. Some cadres said, "We have no money, no technology, and no materials. There's no way." Some people said, "Of course the government will give money if it proposes construction. What's there to be afraid of?" The county committee seized on these passive ideas that only saw things and not people, and launched a widespread discussion among cadres and the masses.

    In the discussion, the county committee proposed the policy of mobilizing the whole people, using poor methods, local methods, using local materials, making do with what we have, and using waste and old materials for construction. At the same time, it guided the masses to conduct three investigations: first, investigate building materials; second, investigate technical strength; and third, investigate labor. Through these three investigations, everyone found that old bricks and wood in the county town could be greatly utilized, technical talents could also be excavated and transferred from government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and people in society, and as for labor, as long as everyone took action, what could not be accomplished?

    In this way, everyone's thinking was liberated, the way forward was found, morale was high, and confidence was doubled, laying the foundation for a conscious action for the whole people to participate in construction. When leveling the ruins in the north of the city and opening up the People's Park, more than 1,000 people participated in voluntary labor every day, with a force like overturning mountains and overturning seas. In this year's early health campaign, money was contributed when people had it and labor was contributed when people could do so. In just 20 days, only 900 yuan was spent to complete the sewer project, which was previously estimated to take several years and require tens of thousands of yuan of investment to cure.

        Using Poor Methods, Local Methods

    From the beginning of Huicheng's construction, rubble piles became treasure troves. In total, during the first five-year plan period, 48.7 million old and broken bricks were used, accounting for 91% of the total number of green bricks used in all buildings; 130 tons of old steel were used, accounting for 84% of the total amount of steel used in all buildings; and 7,470 cubic meters of old wood were used, accounting for 46% of the total amount of wood used in all buildings. As for the stone needed for construction projects, it was all excavated from the ruins. In addition, a large number of broken concrete blocks, old wood and stone carvings, openwork windows, ceramic windows, and waste materials such as old tiles and old cylinders were also used, which is estimated to have saved more than 830,000 yuan in construction costs.

    These waste and old materials, after careful design by the masses, have been used extremely cleverly in new buildings. Take the People's Auditorium as an example. This building, covering an area of 2,680 square meters and with more than 2,300 seats, used old stone for the foundation, old bricks for the walls, large old wood for the large components, scraps of old wood for the floor and folding chairs, old wood carvings for the decoration of the staircase handrails, and old stone lions for the decoration in front of the auditorium. This patchwork not only cost very little money (it would normally cost 250,000 yuan, but it actually only cost 45,000 yuan). As for the three swimming pools in the People's Park, with a total area of 6,200 square meters, the concrete pavement, brick and stone pool bottoms and walls, as well as the changing rooms and rest corridors, were also built with waste and old materials. It would normally cost 120,000 yuan, but it actually only cost 12,000 yuan.

    Huicheng has many dilapidated ancestral halls and temples, and we have made full use of these original buildings and put them to great use. A total of more than 100 ancestral halls and temples have been converted and expanded into factories, warehouses, staff dormitories, schools, offices, hospitals, cultural palaces, restaurants, kindergartens, and cinemas. Among them, more than ten have been converted into factory buildings.

    New buildings have been built, urban public welfare facilities have been improved, and people's living conditions must also be improved. We organized carpenters, masons, painters, etc. to form two home beautification service teams. On the one hand, they helped residents clean up indoor waste and purchased it at a discounted price; on the other hand, they helped residents repair houses and furniture, restoring them to their former glory. Now, a total of more than 2,800 households in the city have been beautified. For the country, many useful raw materials for construction and industrial production have been excavated; for the masses, they have beautified their homes without spending any money.

            Starting from Production

    Even when opening up the People's Park, some people raised a question: "It's good to have a park, but where will so much money come from to maintain it in the future?" They said, "It's easy to build, but difficult to maintain."

    The county committee considered this question as follows: Construction relies on the masses; of course, maintenance cannot be paid for by the state. Therefore, the slogan of "using the park to support the park and using the park to build the park" was put forward, emphasizing that it is both a park for people to rest and a productive park. In this way, not only ornamental trees are planted in the park, but also fruit trees. In addition, 50 acres of papaya and banana gardens were planted, as well as more than 10 acres of roses and jasmine flowers that can be used as industrial raw materials. The 30-acre fruit tree nursery and 20-acre flower nursery in the park can produce more than 200,000 seedlings of various fruits and flowers, and 15,000 pots of seasonal flowers. In addition to self-sufficiency, they also support the needs of other regions in the county and other counties. The scenic lake is not only for people to boat on, but also for raising fish. The zoo also strives to increase production and save money. Most of the animals are exchanged for palm trees cultivated in the park. In order to reduce feeding costs, most of the animals eat grains and grass. A few meat-eating animals are also gradually changing their appetites, letting tigers eat vegetables and otters eat sweet potatoes. It has now become a habit, and less meat is eaten. In addition, the park also raises 80 pigs and 400 chickens, and tries to use empty land to produce short-term crops and feed crops to supply the needs of the zoo and pig and chicken raising. Due to the implementation of the principle of centering on production, using the park to support the park, and using the park to build the park, not only has the People's Park developed from small to large, becoming a scenic area with a beautiful environment, but it has also produced a large amount of material wealth for society, and the park itself has also had a surplus.

    In order to reduce the city's management costs, after mobilizing the masses to clean up more than 800 acres of rotten rubble land in 1952, more than 100,000 papaya, banana, and other fruit trees were planted. Whoever plants them harvests them, greening the city, beautifying the environment, producing more fruit, and increasing the income of residents. The city's cleaning team is also a production team. They sell feces and garbage to farmers, not only being self-sufficient but also having a surplus.

    The City is Transformed, and the People are Transformed

    Before liberation, there were many people in Huicheng who lived off exploitation, and there was also a lot of parasitic population.

    In the years since liberation, through extensive ideological education, the masses have finally raised their awareness in actual productive labor. Labor turns waste into useful things, revitalizes dilapidated families, and turns Huicheng, which was almost a ruin, into a beautiful city. In the face of these fruitful labor results, the masses see the greatness of labor, the greatness of collective strength, and the atmosphere of labor glory, diligence and thrift, and unity and mutual assistance have been greatly promoted. In the past, people who were unwilling to walk down the street with a hoe now feel proud to carry a manure basket.

    The old city becomes a new city, and the old people become new people. The masses see these things, think about these things, and further increase their love for the Party. The relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer. Now, if we have any difficulties in our work, we can get the active help of the masses by holding a meeting and talking about it, and then passing it down.

    Xinhui is the hometown of many overseas Chinese. The construction of Huicheng has also had a great impact on overseas Chinese. When overseas Chinese return to China and see that Huicheng is being built so quickly, they further enhance their love for the motherland and donate or invest money to build Huicheng. A classical-style reading room in the People's Park was built with donations from overseas Chinese. A 500-kilowatt hydropower station that is currently under construction is also invested by overseas Chinese. This spring, after Hong Kong and Macao compatriots organized a tour group to return to their hometown and came to Huicheng, they resolutely demanded to work on Qingfeng Mountain for a day. They said: "Our hometown is built so well, we are ashamed not to participate in labor!"

        Huicheng is Still Under Construction

    Now, the construction of Huicheng is still continuing. We have now begun to mobilize the masses to fully develop Qingfeng Mountain. Qingfeng Mountain is a large barren mountain covering an area of 50,000 acres. According to custom, every year in the ninth month of the lunar calendar, thousands of people go to Qingfeng Mountain to climb to a high place, and many people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Jiangmen also come here to visit. We plan to build Qingfeng Mountain into a large-scale zoo and botanical garden, which is both a demonstration farm, a living exhibition hall, and a scenic tourist attraction and resort.

    In addition, according to the needs of urban development, we are also preparing to continue to organize the masses to use poor methods to renovate sewage ditches and build buildings such as gymnasiums, sports fields, libraries, science museums, cultural and art galleries, and children's palaces. We are determined, under the glorious light of the general line of socialist construction, to rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, and build Huicheng even more beautifully, so that Huicheng can better serve the great leap forward in industry and agriculture and the working people.

　　在废墟上建设了美丽的会城
　　中共新会县县委书记
　　新会县县长　　　萧辉
    新会县位于广东珠江三角洲的西南，是一个比较富裕的，以生产粮食为主，经济作物也较发达的地区。县城设于会城镇。会城镇地居全县中心偏北，城区面积二点三平方公里，现有人口三万四千多人。
    会城是一个很古老的城镇，抗日战争前曾有十二万人口，近一万间房屋。由于日本帝国主义的侵略和国民党的残酷统治，这个县城遭受到严重的破坏。到1949年，人口只剩二万七千多人，其中失业无业者达八千多人，房屋被毁达三分之一以上。全城到处是瓦砾危墙，破房烂庙，遍地是垃圾粪便和一团团的蚊蝇白蚁，大小渠道一概淤塞不通，污水横流，臭气熏天，疾病流行。当时，人们说会城有“十多”：“破产失业多，盗窃多，乞儿多，娼妓多，垃圾多，蚊蝇多，烟鬼赌徒多，残砖破瓦多，流行病多，死亡多”。
    现在，会城完全变了样。这里，已经建设起十几个工厂，全镇消灭了失业现象，人人有工作，家家无闲人。在生产发展的基础上，城市建设也有了很快的发展。几年来，相继出现了人民礼堂、人民医院、百货大楼、工人文化宫、人民文化馆、展览馆、妇幼保健院、托儿所、幼儿园等新的建筑。旧的下水道全部经过清理，新开辟了明渠一百多条，新建下水道三百多公尺、重建新建混凝土马路五千公尺。在城北一千多亩面积的废墟上，建设了大型的人民公园。园内有高级、初级和儿童游泳池各一个，有饲养着飞禽走兽和两栖爬行动物四十余种的动物园，有可供游客划船的风景湖，有儿童游乐场一个，各式凉亭八座，还有各式各样的果树，风景树和花圃、苗场。全城街坊之间的瓦砾场上另外建设了四十七个小花园。街道旁绿树成行，鲜花芬芳，它成为我国南方美丽的县城。
        五个观点，一个方法
    县委对会城建设工作的领导，也像对其他工作的领导一样，着重对干部进行了五个观点（生产观点、群众观点、阶级观点、勤俭观点、辩证观点）和一个方法（走群众路线的工作方法）的教育，使干部懂得去发挥人的积极性，由积极的人去把一切消极的物化为积极的物来进行建设。
    人民对建设自己的城市所想到的事情很多，工人们常说：“下了班没处去，要有个公园就好了。”青、壮年人爱好游泳，许多人都希望能有一个游泳池。人人都喜欢看戏，很想县里建设一个戏院，小孩也希望有个游乐场所，人民群众的这些要求都是无可非议的。
    当县委提出要把会城建设成一个美丽的社会主义城市，不少干部和群众缺乏信心。有些干部说：“一无钱，二无技术，三无材料，没有办法”。有些群众说：“政府提出要建设，当然会拿钱，怕什么？”县委抓住这些见物不见人的消极思想，在干部和群众中展开了广泛的讨论。
    在讨论中县委提出了全民动手，用穷办法，土办法，就地取材，因陋就简，利用废料旧物进行建设的方针，同时，引导群众进行了三查：一查建筑材料，二查技术力量，三查劳动力。通过三查，大家发现县城里旧的砖头、木料，可以大大利用，技术人材也可以从机关、团体、企业和社会人士中挖掘、抽调，至于劳动力，只要大家来动手，还有什么事情是办不成的？
    这样，大家的思想解放了，门路找到了，情绪高涨，信心百倍，为全民参加建设打下了自觉行动的基础。在扫平城北废墟，开辟人民公园的时候，每天都有一千多人参加义务劳动，势如排山倒海。今年年初的卫生运动，有钱出钱，有人出人，仅用二十天的时间，只花了九百元，就完成了以前估计要用几年时间，需要几万元投资才能根治的下水道工程。
        用穷办法、土办法
    会城的建设一开始，瓦砾堆便成了宝藏库。总计在第一个五年计划期间，共用了旧砖破砖四千八百七十万块，占全部建筑使用青砖总数的91％；共用旧钢材一百三十吨，占全部建筑使用钢材总数的84％；共用旧木材七千四百七十立方公尺，占全部建筑使用木材总数的46％。至于建筑工程所需要的石料，全部是从废墟里挖掘出来的。此外，还大量使用了破烂的混凝土块，旧木石雕刻，通花窗，陶瓷窗和旧瓦、旧筒等废弃的材料，估计共节省了建筑费用八十三万多元。
    这些废物旧料，经过群众的精心设计，都在新的建筑中得到极其巧妙的利用。拿人民礼堂来说，这座占地二千六百八十平方公尺，设有二千三百多个座位的建筑物，用旧石料做成基础，用旧砖砌了墙身，用旧的大木料做了大型的构件，用零碎的旧木料做了楼板和活动椅，用旧木雕做了楼梯扶手的装饰，用旧石狮子做了礼堂门前的装饰。这样七拼八凑，不但花钱很少（按正常造价需二十五万元，实际只用去四万五千元）。以人民公园三个游泳池来说，总面积达六千二百平方公尺，混凝土的路面，砖石的池底和池壁，还有更衣室和休息廊，同样是用废物旧料建筑起来的，按正常造价需十二万元，实际只用了一万二千元。
    会城有许多破烂的祠堂和庙宇，我们充分利用这些原有的建筑，派了大用场。总计把祠堂和庙宇改建、扩建为厂房、仓库、职工宿舍、学校、办公室、医院、文化宫、酒家、幼儿园、电影院的，共一百余处。其中改建为工厂厂房的十余处。
    新的建筑盖起来了，城市公共福利设施改善了，人民的居住条件也要改善。我们就组织木工、泥水工、油漆工等成立了两个美化家庭服务小组。一方面帮助居民清理室内废物，折价收购；一方面帮助居民修理房屋、家具、整旧如新。现在全城经过美化的家庭共有二千八百余户。对国家说来，挖掘出许多建设上和工业生产上有用的原材料；对群众说来，没有花钱就美化了家庭。
            从生产出发
    还是在开辟人民公园的时候，就有些群众提出一个问题：“搞公园好是好，但将来那有这么多钱来养护？”他们说：“建设容易养护难”。
    对这个问题，县委是这样考虑的：建设是依靠群众；养护当然更不能让国家出钱。因此，就提出以园养园，以园建园的口号，强调是供人休息的公园，又是生产性的公园。这样，公园内不仅种风景树，还种果树，另外还种了五十亩木瓜和香蕉园，十多亩可作工业原料的玫瑰花和茉莉香花。公园里的三十亩果树苗场和二十亩花苗场，可生产各种果苗、花苗二十多万株，时花一万五千盆，除自给外，还支援了本县其他地区和外县的需要，风景湖不仅供人划船，还养了鱼。动物园也力求增产节约。绝大部分动物是用公园所培植的蒲葵交换来的。为考虑减少饲养费用，动物中以吃杂粮、吃草的为多数。少数吃肉的也逐渐改造他们的胃口，让老虎吃素，让水獭吃红薯，现在已开始成为习惯，肉类吃得较少了。此外，公园里还养了八十头猪，四百只鸡，并尽量利用空地，生产短期作物、饲料作物，供给动物园和养猪养鸡的需要。由于贯彻了以生产为中心，以园养园，以园建园的原则，不但人民公园已经由小到大地发展起来，成为一个环境幽美的风景区，而且为社会生产了大量的物质财富，公园本身也有了盈余。
    为了减少城市的管理费用。1952年发动群众清理八百多亩烂瓦砾地后，就种上了十万多棵木瓜香蕉等果树，谁种谁收，绿化了城市，美化了环境，多产了水果，增加了居民的收入。城里的清洁队也是一支生产队，他们把粪便垃圾卖给农民，不但自给，还有盈余。
    改造了城市，也改造了人
    解放前的会城，吃剥削饭的人很多，寄生的人口也很多。
    解放几年来，经过广泛的思想教育，群众在实际的生产劳动中，终于提高了自己的觉悟。劳动，把废物变成有用的东西，使破烂的家庭焕燃一新，使几成废墟的会城变为一个美丽的城市。群众在这些丰硕的劳动果实面前，看到劳动的伟大，集体力量的伟大，劳动光荣的风气、勤俭的风气、团结互助的风气都大大发扬了。过去拿起锄头不愿走大街的，现在挑起粪筐感到自豪。
    旧城变新城，旧人变新人。群众看到这些，想到这些，更增加了对党的爱戴。党和群众的关系进一步的密切了。现在我们工作中要有什么困难，开个会一讲，再传达下去，就能得到群众的积极帮助。
    新会是很多海外华侨的家乡。会城的建设也在海外华侨中起了很大的影响。华侨回国，看到会城建设得这样快，更增强了对祖国的热爱，并且纷纷捐款或投资来建设会城。人民公园里一个古典式的阅览室，就是华侨捐款修建的。现在正在建设的一个五百瓩的水电站，也是华侨投资的。今年春天，港澳同胞组织回乡观光团到会城后，坚决要求到青峰山劳动一天。他们说：“家乡建设得这么好，不参加劳动真惭愧！”
        会城在继续建设中
    现在，会城的建设还在继续进行中。现在已经开始发动群众全面开发青峰山。青峰山是一座占地五万亩的大荒山。按照习惯，每年阴历九月，每天都有成千上万的人上青峰山登高，香港、澳门和江门等地也有许多人到这里来游览。我们计划把青峰山建设成一个大规模的动物园和植物园，既是示范农场，活展览馆，又是山明水秀的游览风景区和休养胜地。
    此外，根据城市发展的需要，我们还准备继续组织群众用穷办法来整治污水沟，建设体育馆、运动场、图书馆、科学馆、文化艺术馆、少年宫等建筑。我们有决心在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠群众，自力更生，把会城建设得更加美丽，使会城更好地为工农业大跃进，为劳动人民服务。（附图片）
