Reading "Red Flag"
	Wang Xiyu

"Red Flag," upon publication, immediately became an indispensable good teacher and helpful friend in people's lives. Everyone has such a feeling: "If you don't see it, you miss it; once you get it, you read it all." "After reading this issue, you look forward to the next." Why is "Red Flag" so attractive? Personally, I feel that this magazine has two obvious characteristics. First, its entire content is filled with the real life of the current great leap forward in China's socialist construction, reflecting the face of China's socialist construction, and achieving a close combination of theory and practice. Precisely because every article comes from life, its content is lively and closely related to the problems in people's work and thinking, with absolutely no trace of dull pedantry. Second, it also has its characteristics in terms of writing. Each article is not a single tone or a single face, but each has its own style. But all the articles have one thing in common – they are easy to understand. Reading them does not feel tedious or strenuous, but relaxed and pleasant. "Red Flag" has truly established a revolutionary, critical, and theory-linking-practice banner in the theoretical world.

Here, I would like to focus on my views on the third issue. After reading the third issue, my most profound impression is: the center is prominent, and each article is organically coordinated to form a whole.

Comrade Guo Moruo's "Romanticism and Realism" vividly discusses the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism. With great enthusiasm, the author praised our era, praised the leadership of the Party, expressed the infinite admiration and love of the people of the whole country for the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and reflected the soaring drive and pioneering spirit of the Chinese people under the light of the general line for socialist construction.

Comrade Chen Boda's "A Brand New Society, Brand New People" and the two newsletters about the small factories run by the Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative in Echeng, Hubei, form a group of articles. The deeds of Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative are an example of China's socialist construction, but this is a microcosm of the general high tide of China's socialist national economy. Comrade Chen Boda grasped this "microcosm" and analyzed and summarized it. The author not only expounded the great revolutionary significance of the several key points contained in the Party's general line for socialist construction and summarized the basic experience of cooperative-run industries, but also further pointed out that with the establishment of cooperative-run industries one after another, the face of China's society and the Chinese people is undergoing profound changes, and pointed out that this is "the concrete and gradual realization of the ideals of the founders of scientific communism by the Chinese people in real life." Comrade Chen Boda's commentary helps us to correctly view these "ordinary" and common new things and to correctly view China's current great leap forward in production and its far-reaching impact.

For several years, there has been a debate between the two methods of building socialism, "more, faster, better, and more economical" versus "less, slower, worse, and more expensive," and even now it is hard to say that everyone has figured it out. The editors timely seized this fundamental issue and formed another group of articles under the general title of "Two Methods and Two Results in the Development of the National Economy." Comrade Bo Yibo's article compared the two methods of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" and "more, faster, better, and more economical" in the development of industry. The former method is mainly manifested in only running large-scale industries, neglecting small and medium-sized industries, only running high-standard industries, looking down on low-standard industries, only requiring the state to run industries, and not mobilizing the masses to run industries, which resulted in limiting the development of industry. The latter method, due to the implementation of the Party Central Committee's policy of combining industry and agriculture, combining central and local efforts, combining large, medium, and small sizes, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, has resulted in the situation of "blast furnaces and converters blooming everywhere, and molten iron and molten steel flowing everywhere." "The Dispute Between Grass and Trees" and "The Dispute Between Cultivation and Capture" introduced the debate between the two methods through specific examples, and the great leap forward in production that followed the victory of the correct policy. Although this is about the specific work of two departments, in terms of the methods of developing industry, it actually existed in various departments, or to varying degrees in some departments, so it has universal significance. Comrade Kong Sang's article "Starting from Reality or Starting from Subjectivity?" commented on the ideological roots of the two methods of building socialism from the perspective of ideological methods. Comrades engaged in various jobs can benefit from this group of articles.

"On-site Conference" and "Inspection and Evaluation" are two articles on how to summarize experience and promote experience, and specifically tell readers how to implement the leadership method of the mass line.

I also feel that the third issue is not only well-arranged in content, but also more lively in terms of layout than the first and second issues.

Finally, I think that "Red Flag" has too few articles on ideological and academic commentary, which cannot be said to be a shortcoming, and I hope that this aspect will be appropriately increased in the future.

### 读“红旗”

    读“红旗”
    王锡禹
    “红旗”一出版，就立刻成为人们生活中不可缺少的良师益友。人人都有这样的心情：“看不到就想它，拿到手就读完它”，“读了这期盼下期”。“红旗”为什么这样吸引人呢？我个人感到，这个杂志主要有两个明显的特色。首先，它的整个篇幅都沸腾着当前我国社会主义建设大跃进的现实生活，反映了我国社会主义建设的面貌，做到了理论和实际的紧密结合。正因为每篇文章都是从生活中来的，因此，它的内容是生动活泼的，同人们工作中和思想中的问题是休戚相关的，根本闻不到那种死气沉沉的学究气味。其次，在文字上也有它的特点。每篇文章不是一个调调，一个面孔，而是各有自己的风格。但各篇文章又有一个共同点——深入浅出。使人读起来不感到乏味、吃力，而轻松愉快。“红旗”在理论界真正树立了一面革命的、批判的、理论联系实际的旗帜。
    这里，我想着重谈谈对第三期的看法。读完第三期后，我的一个极其深刻的印象是：中心突出，各篇文章有机地配合，组成了一个整体。
    郭沫若同志写的“浪漫主义和现实主义”，生动地论述了革命的浪漫主义和革命的现实主义的结合问题。作者以极大的热忱，歌颂了我们的时代，歌颂了党的领导，表达了全国人民对伟大领袖毛泽东同志的无限敬仰和爱戴，反映了我国人民在建设社会主义总路线的照耀下的冲天干劲和首创精神。
    陈伯达同志的“全新的社会，全新的人”和湖北鄂城旭光一社办小小工厂的两篇通讯，组成了一组文章。旭光一社的事迹，是我国社会主义建设事业中的一个事例，但这正是我国社会主义国民经济普遍高涨的一个缩影，陈伯达同志抓住这个“缩影”，进行了分析和概括。作者不仅阐述了党的建设社会主义总路线包含的几个要点的伟大革命意义，总结了社办工业的基本经验，而且进一步指出了由于社办工业一批一批的建立，我国社会和我国人民的面貌正在经历着深刻的变化，指出这是“我国人民在现实生活中，具体地、逐步地实现科学共产主义创始人的理想”。陈伯达同志的这篇评论，帮助我们正确地看待这些“普通”的、常见的新生事物，正确看待我国当前的生产大跃进和它的深远影响。
    几年以来，“多快好省”与“少慢差费”这两种建设社会主义的方法一直是有争论的，而且直到现在也还很难说所有的人都想通了。编者及时抓住这个根本问题，在“发展国民经济问题上的两种方法、两种结果”的总标题下，又组成了一组文章。薄一波同志的文章，对发展工业方面的“少慢差费”和“多快好省”的两种方法进行了对比。前一种方法，主要表现在只办大型工业，轻视中小型工业，只办高标准工业，看不起低标准的工业，只要求国家办工业，不发动群众办工业，结果限制了工业的发展。后一种方法，由于执行了党中央提出的工农业并举、中央和地方并举、大中小并举、土洋并举的方针，就出现了“高炉和转炉遍地开花，铁水和钢水到处奔流”的局面。“草木之争”和“养捕之争”通过具体事例，介绍了两种方法的争论，和随着正确方针的胜利而来的生产大跃进。这里虽然讲的是两个部门的具体工作，但从发展工业的方法上来说，实际上在各个部门都存在过，或者现在有的部门也还不同程度地存在着，因此，它就具有普遍的意义。孔桑同志“从实际出发，还是从主观出发？”的文章，从思想方法上评述了两种建设社会主义方法的思想根源。从事各种工作的同志，从这一组文章中，都可以得到益处。
    “现场会议”和“检查评比”是两篇关于如何总结经验和推广经验的文章，具体地告诉了读者如何贯彻群众路线的领导方法。
    我还觉得，第三期不仅在内容上编排得好，在版面设置方面，比第一、二期更显得活泼。
    最后，我认为“红旗”关于思想学术评论的文章似乎太少，这不能说不是一个缺点，希望今后适当增加这方面的篇幅。
