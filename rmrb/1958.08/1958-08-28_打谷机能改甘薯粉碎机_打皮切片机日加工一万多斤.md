　　Threshing Machine Can Be Modified into Sweet Potato Crusher
　　Peeling and Slicing Machine Processes Over 10,000 Jin Daily

　　(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Pu Guangrong, a cadre from the Grain Bureau of Xichong County, Sichuan, modified a threshing machine into a sweet potato crusher, solving the difficulty of insufficient tools when a large number of sweet potatoes urgently needed processing after the autumn harvest. This machine, operated by two people, can grind more than 12,000 jin of sweet potato flour per day.

　　The modification method is very simple. Just remove the iron buckle roller of the threshing machine and replace it with an iron sheet grinding roller. When in use, uncover the canopy of the threshing machine, install a wooden sleeve plate to control the sweet potatoes on the grinding roller, grind large sweet potatoes on the front, and small sweet potatoes on the side. After the sweet potatoes are ground, remove the grinding roller and wooden sleeve plate, and reinstall the threshing machine parts to turn it back into a threshing machine. This new improvement is estimated to save farmers across the county 10,000 yuan in funds. It is now being promoted throughout the county and will soon ensure that every team has a flour mill.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Zhang Jiuqing, the business group leader of the Fourth Outlet of the jointly-operated state-private Gongnong Canteen in Heishan Town, Heishan County, Liaoning Province, after more than ten days and nights of hard work, designed and successfully manufactured a foot-operated potato peeling, shredding, and slicing machine. After testing, this machine has shown good results. This type of peeling, shredding, and slicing machine can process about 8,000 jin of potatoes per day (using both shreds and slices) for the small type; the large type can process 15,000 jin of potatoes per day.

　　打谷机能改甘薯粉碎机
    打皮切片机日加工一万多斤
    据新华社讯　四川西充县粮食局干部蒲光荣用打谷机改装红苕（甘薯）粉碎机，解决了秋后大量红苕急待加工处理时工具不足的困难。这种机器两人操作，一天能磨红苕粉一万二千多斤。
    改装的办法很简单，只要拆下打谷机的铁扣转辊，换上铁皮磨辊就行了。在使用时，揭开打谷机的篷盖，在磨辊上装上一个控制红苕的木套盘，正面磨大苕，侧面磨小苕。红苕磨完后，将磨辊和木套盘取下，装上打谷机的零件就又成了打谷机。这项新的改进，估计为全县农民节约万元资金。现在全县正在推广，很快就能做到队队都有磨粉机。
    本报讯　辽宁省黑山县黑山镇公私合营工农食堂第四门市部营业组长张九清，经过十多昼夜的苦钻苦干，设计并制造成功一种脚踏式薯类打皮切丝切片机。这台机器经试验，效果良好。这种打皮切丝切片机，小型的每天可以加工薯类八千斤左右（丝片齐用）；大型的每天可以加工薯类一万五千斤。（罗文秀）
