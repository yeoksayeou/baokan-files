Guizhou eliminates third-class seedlings

According to the Guizhou Daily, farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou are doing everything possible to make the third-class seedlings of rice, corn, and sweet potatoes catch up with the first-class seedlings, striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

At present, the planting of rice, corn, and sweet potatoes has basically ended throughout the province, and the seedlings are growing well in most areas; however, some mountainous areas have suffered from an unprecedented drought this spring, and some areas cannot keep up with the needs in terms of fertilizer and weeding, so about 15% of the seedlings are still not growing well.

In order to ensure increased grain production throughout the province and strive for an even greater bumper harvest, a campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings is being launched throughout the province. After more than a month of repeated inspections, evaluations, and concentrated remediation, significant changes have taken place in all types of seedlings. In the Zunyi area at the end of June, first-class rice seedlings accounted for 60%, second-class seedlings accounted for 25%, and third-class seedlings accounted for 15%; after half a month of intensive work, first-class seedlings rose to 64.7%, second-class seedlings fell to 24.1%, and third-class seedlings fell to 11.2%.

    贵州消灭三类苗
    据贵州日报讯　贵州山区各族农民千方百计要水稻、玉米和红薯的三类苗赶上一类苗，争取秋季大丰收。
    目前全省水稻、玉米、红薯栽种已基本结束，绝大部分地区禾苗生长良好；但部分山区今春遭受百年未有的干旱，以及某些地区在肥料、薅锄等方面赶不上需要，仍有15％左右的禾苗长得不好。
    为了保证全省粮食增产，并力争更大的丰收，一个以消灭三类苗为主的运动，正在全省范围内展开。经过一个多月来的反复检查评比和突击补救，各类苗都有显著变化。遵义专区6月底时，水稻一类苗占60％，二类苗占25％，三类苗占15％；经过半月突击，一类上升到64.7％，二类下降为24.1％，三类下降为11.2％。
