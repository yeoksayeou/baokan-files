Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 5th: Jiangxi Province recently organized more than 100,000 cadres from six levels—province, prefecture, county, district, township, and commune—to converge in the countryside. They are working alongside farmers to strengthen field management, striving for an even greater late rice harvest. Yang Shangkun, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Secretary Liu Junxiu are personally participating in and leading this effort.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires cadres sent to the countryside and all farmers in the province to promptly grasp the following eight specific measures: (1) Complete and overfulfill the summer harvesting and planting tasks on time, in quantity, and with quality. In order to ensure that late rice is not planted after the "Beginning of Autumn," harvesting should be done immediately wherever possible, and planting should be done immediately. Achieve "yellow in the morning, green in the afternoon." Late rice must be planted before the Beginning of Autumn, and sweet potatoes should be planted in a timely manner. (2) Intensify water storage and drought prevention work to ensure the irrigation needs of late rice and other crops. Currently, special emphasis should be placed on filling reservoirs and ponds where there are water sources. Water must not be allowed to flow away in vain. (3) Vigorously fulfill fertilizer accumulation and production plans. After the summer harvest and planting are basically completed, a concentrated fertilizer accumulation and production campaign should be launched immediately, and the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers should be widely promoted. Ensure that each mu of late rice has more than 300 dan of various raw fertilizers. (4) Continue to implement rational close planting, and at the same time, pay attention to cultivating high-yield demonstration fields producing over 10,000 jin. When promoting close planting, special attention should be paid to complex close planting that facilitates weeding, topdressing, sunlight exposure, and ventilation. (5) Promote improved varieties. In order to widely promote improved varieties next year, seize the opportunity during the early rice harvest to select and reserve seeds of early rice to meet the needs of next year's Great Leap Forward in production. (6) Strengthen field management. After the summer harvest and planting are basically completed, all localities should immediately check whether the planting plan has been completed. Ensure full stands of seedlings, strong seedlings, timely weeding, hoeing, and topdressing to ensure the healthy growth of late rice and other crops. (7) Eliminate pests and diseases. Areas where pests and diseases have occurred should immediately mobilize the masses to eliminate them. Areas where pests and diseases have not occurred should do a good job in prevention and control. (8) Intensify the improvement of agricultural tools and transportation equipment. Before the autumn harvest, agricultural tools and transportation equipment should be vigorously improved, striving to achieve universal improvement of agricultural tools, motorized transport, and the use of ball bearings in vehicles to improve labor efficiency.

    抓紧八项措施　加强田间管理
    江西十万干部会师田间
    据新华社南昌5日电　江西省最近组织省、地、县、区、乡、社六级干部十万多人在农村大会师，深入田间和农民一道加强田间管理，力争晚稻更大丰收。中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎和书记刘俊秀亲自参加和领导了这一工作。
    中共江西省委要求下乡干部和全省农民，必须及时抓紧以下八项具体措施：（一）按时按量按质完成和超额完成夏收夏种任务。为了做到晚稻不栽“立秋”禾，能割的就马上割，能种的马上种，要做到“上午黄下午青”，立秋前一定要把晚稻栽下去，要及时插下红薯。（二）加紧做好蓄水防旱工作，保证晚稻和其他农作物的灌溉需要。目前要特别着重在有水源的地方，把水库、水塘装满，绝不能让水白白流走。（三）大力完成积肥造肥计划。在夏收夏种基本结束以后，要立即开展一个突击积肥造肥运动，并普遍地推广制造土化肥。保证每亩晚稻有各种原肥三百担以上。（四）继续贯彻合理密植，同时要注意培养万斤以上的高额丰产田。推行密植时，要特别注意便利耘禾、追肥、阳光照射和通风的复式密植。（五）推广良种。为了明年普遍推广良种，在早稻收割中，抓紧早稻的选种、留种工作，以满足明年生产大跃进的需要。（六）加强田间管理。夏收夏种基本结束后，各地要立即检查播种计划是否完成。要作到全苗、壮苗、及时耘田、锄草、追肥，保证晚稻及其他农作物生长好。（七）消灭病虫害。发生病虫害的地区应立即发动群众扑灭，未发生病虫害的地区要做好防治工作。（八）加紧改良农具和交通运输工具。在秋收前，应大力改良农具和交通运输工具，尽量做到农具普遍改良、运输车子化、车子滚珠轴承化，以提高劳动效率。（附图片）
