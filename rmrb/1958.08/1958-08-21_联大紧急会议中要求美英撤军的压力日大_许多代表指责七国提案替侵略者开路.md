Xinhua News Agency, August 20th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session continued on the morning of August 19th.

　　Polish delegation head and Foreign Minister Rapacki said that the intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom was unjustified, and this intervention was a violation of the United Nations Charter and the credibility of the United Nations.

　　Rapacki demanded the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He said that some delegations had put forward a series of proposals at the meeting, which could be studied at the appropriate time and under appropriate circumstances. However, restoring the rights to freedom and independence of the people of the Near East should be a necessary prerequisite for studying these proposals. To this end, the intervention forces must be withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan quickly. Rapacki added that the United Nations Observer Group could continue to work in Lebanon for a period. He said that all these opinions had been clearly articulated in the Soviet proposal, and the Polish delegation fully supported this proposal.

　　The Polish Foreign Minister opposed the proposal put forward by the Norwegian and other delegations. He said that this proposal opened the door to approving acts of aggression and could not guarantee the rapid withdrawal of the United States and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

　　The head of the Burmese delegation, U Thant, said that the primary issue in the Near East was to solve political problems rather than economic ones. Therefore, the only reasonable step for the United Nations was to try to facilitate the rapid withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan to restore stability in the Arab East. The Burmese representative emphasized that the sooner the United States and British troops withdrew, the sooner the Middle East region would return to normal.

　　U Thant pointed out that the Burmese delegation could not agree to replace the United Nations Observer Group in the Near East with an international "police force" because such a police force used force to impose its will on others.

　　Pakistani representative Ali Khan defended the US-UK aggression. He rehashed the slander of "indirect aggression" and demanded the establishment of a permanent United Nations police force. In order to divert the attention of the General Assembly, Ali Khan also vigorously advocated the establishment of a so-called regional organization for the economic development of Arab countries.

　　Lebanese representative Malik, who only represents former Lebanese President Chamoun and his American masters, said that he was "grateful" to the United States for implementing military occupation in his country. He repeatedly said that someone was threatening Lebanon's political independence and territorial integrity, but he did not cite any facts to prove this claim.

　　The last speaker at the morning meeting was the Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Popovic. He emphasized that the current situation in the Near East was very serious and dangerous. Popovic said that the landing of American and British armed forces in Lebanon and Jordan respectively was an intolerable armed intervention in the internal affairs of these countries.

　　However, Popovic said that what was needed now was not to condemn or support the actions of the United States and the United Kingdom, but to take decisions to make it possible to eliminate the existing dangerous situation. He said that it must be assumed that there was a universal desire to reach a solution, and even the US and UK, which sent troops to the Middle East, had "repeatedly expressed their desire to withdraw these troops as soon as possible," so there should be a basis for reaching an agreement.

　　The Yugoslav representative did not indicate his delegation's attitude towards the Soviet proposal and the seven-nation proposal of Norway, Canada, and others. He said that he would express his opinion on these proposals later.

Xinhua News Agency, August 20th, according to TASS dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session continued in the afternoon of August 19th.

　　The head of the Moroccan delegation, Filali, spoke first. He said: The Arabs in the Near East and North Africa are fighting, demanding independence and unity against the remnants of colonialism. He also mentioned that there are still foreign troops remaining on Moroccan territory, which is "contrary to logic and reason," and that the people of Morocco's neighbor, Algeria, have been waging a bloody war for independence for four years. He emphasized that the Lebanese and Jordanian crisis should be studied from the perspective of the overall struggle of the people in the Middle East and North Africa against the remnants of colonialism.

　　Regarding the Lebanon and Jordan issue, Filali emphasized that the urgent issue that must be resolved is the issue of foreign troops stationed in Lebanon and Jordan. He said that the Moroccan government believes that the dispatch of troops by the United States and the United Kingdom to Lebanon and Jordan is "completely unjustified...and the reasons are all fabricated."

　　He said: We believe that the primary purpose of the United Nations General Assembly should be to reach a resolution that promotes the withdrawal of foreign troops in the shortest possible period.

　　Norwegian representative Engen presented the "arguments" for the seven-nation proposal of Canada, Norway, Denmark, Liberia, Colombia, Panama, and Paraguay to the General Assembly. His speech, like the "seven-nation" proposal itself, was ambiguous and did not address the substance of the issue under discussion. Engen and the Canadian representative who spoke after him both attempted to portray their proposal as a "compromise" proposal, although in essence this proposal was the proposal of the United Kingdom and the United States.

　　Canadian Foreign Minister Smith, another drafter of the "seven-nation" proposal, asked Arab countries to believe that this proposal was the "most appropriate" and "most beneficial" proposal under the current conditions, and if they agreed to this proposal, then "peace and tranquility" would appear in the Near East.

　　Smith stubbornly insisted that no way could be found to resolve the withdrawal of the United States and the United Kingdom from Lebanon and Jordan.

　　Ukrainian Foreign Minister Paramarchuk expressed opposition to the "seven-nation" proposal and support for the Soviet proposal in his speech. He said that the United Nations General Assembly should resolutely condemn the aggressive acts of the United States and the United Kingdom and not allow them to evade responsibility.

　　He also refuted the argument that the Middle East crisis was caused by "indirect aggression," pointing out that this argument was completely unfounded.

　　The head of the Peruvian delegation, Belaunde, made a lengthy speech in which he expressed support for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and called for cooperation between large and small countries. This was the speech of the second representative of a Latin American country, and his speech was very representative of the position of Latin American countries. They are unwilling to defend the US aggression against Lebanon at the General Assembly. On the contrary, although they were vague and did not mention aggression, they were actually condemning aggression and emphasizing their belief in the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of small countries. At present, the US delegation is stepping up its efforts to put pressure on the representatives of Latin American countries outside the meeting, asking them to support the "seven-nation" proposal when voting. To this end, the US delegation convened representatives of Latin American countries individually for talks several times a day.

### 联大紧急会议中要求美英撤军的压力日大  许多代表指责七国提案替侵略者开路

　　联大紧急会议中要求美英撤军的压力日大
    许多代表指责七国提案替侵略者开路
    据新华社20日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会紧急特别会议19日上午继续举行。
    波兰代表团团长、外交部长腊帕茨基说，美英两国的干涉没有任何道理，这种干涉是对联合国宪章和联合国威信的破坏。
    腊帕茨基要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。他说，某些代表团在会议上提出了一系列建议，这些建议可以在适当的时间和适当的情况下来研究。可是，恢复中近东人民的自由和独立的权利应该是研究这些建议的必要的先决条件。为此，必须迅速地使干涉军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。腊帕茨基补充说，联合国观察团可以在黎巴嫩继续工作一个时期。他说，所有这些意见已经在苏联的提案中有了明确清楚的阐述，波兰代表团完全支持这个提案。
    波兰外交部长反对挪威等国代表团提出的提案。他说，这个提案为批准侵略行为敞开了大门，不能保证美国和英国军队迅速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    缅甸代表团团长吴丹说，中近东的首要问题是解决政治问题而不是经济问题。因此联合国唯一合理的步骤是设法使外国军队迅速撤离黎巴嫩和约旦，以恢复阿拉伯东方的稳定。缅甸代表强调指出，美国和英国军队撤离得越快，中东地区恢复正常局面也就越快。
    吴丹指出，缅甸代表团不能同意用国际“警察部队”来代替中近东的联合国观察团，因为这种警察部队是用武力来把自己的意志强加给别人的。
    巴基斯坦代表阿里汗为美英的侵略行动辩护。他重弹“间接侵略”的谰调，并且要求建立常设的联合国警察部队。阿里汗为了转移大会视线还大肆鼓吹必须建立所谓阿拉伯国家经济发展区域性组织。
    只代表黎巴嫩前总统夏蒙和美国主子的黎巴嫩代表马利克说，他“感谢”美国对他的国家实行军事占领。他反来复去地说，有人威胁黎巴嫩的政治独立和领土完整，但是又没有举出任何事实来证明这种说法。
    在上午会议上最后发言的是南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长波波维奇。他强调指出，近东的当前局势非常严重和危险。波波维奇说，美国和英国的武装力量分别在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆是对这些国家内政不可容忍的武装干涉。
    但是，波波维奇说，现在所需要的不是谴责或者支持美国和英国的行动，而是采取决定，以使消除现存危险局势成为可能。他说，必须假定存在着达成一项解决办法的普遍愿望，甚至派兵进入中东的美英也“一再表示了他们希望尽快撤退这些军队的愿望”，因此，应当存在一个达成协议的基础。
    南斯拉夫代表丝毫没有表示他的代表团对苏联提案和对挪威、加拿大等七国提案的态度。他说，等以后再对这些提案表示意见。
    据新华社20日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会紧急特别会议19日下午继续举行。
    摩洛哥代表团团长菲拉利首先发言。他说：近东和北非的阿拉伯人在进行斗争，他们要求独立和团结一致地反对殖民主义残余。他并且提到，现在仍然有外国军队留在摩洛哥的领土上，这是“违反逻辑和理智”的，摩洛哥的邻国阿尔及利亚的人民为了争取独立四年来一直在进行着流血战争。他强调指出，应该从中东和北非地区的人民反对殖民主义残余的总的斗争的角度来研究黎巴嫩和约旦的危机。
    关于黎巴嫩和约旦问题，菲拉利强调，必须解决的迫切的问题是外国军队驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。他说，摩洛哥政府认为，美国和英国出兵到黎巴嫩和约旦是“完全没有正当理由的……，其理由都是杜撰的”。
    他说：我们认为，联合国大会的首要目的应当是达成促使外国军队在最短期间内撤退的决议。
    挪威代表恩根向大会提出了加拿大、挪威、丹麦、利比里亚、哥伦比亚、巴拿马、巴拉圭七国提案的“论据”。他的发言同“七国”提案本身一样含糊其词，没有涉及所讨论的问题的实质。恩根和在他以后发言的加拿大代表都企图把他们的提案说成是一个“折衷”的提案，虽然实质上这个提案就是英美的提案。
    “七国”提案的另一个草拟国加拿大的外交部长史密斯要求阿拉伯国家相信，这个提案在当前条件下是“最适当的”，“最有好处的”提案，如果它们同意这个提案，那么中近东就会出现“和平和安宁”。
    史密斯硬说，现在找不到任何办法可以解决美国和英国从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军问题。
    乌克兰外交部长帕拉马尔楚克在发言中表示反对“七国”提案而支持苏联提案。他说，联合国大会应该坚决谴责美国和英国的侵略行为，不要让它们推卸责任。
    他还驳斥了所谓中东危机是由“间接侵略”引起的这种论调，指出这种论断是完全没有根据的。
    秘鲁代表团团长贝朗德作了长篇发言，他表示支持不干涉别国内政的原则，并且号召大小国家进行合作。这是第二个拉丁美洲国家的代表的发言，他的发言很能代表拉丁美洲国家的立场。他们不愿意在大会上为美国侵略黎巴嫩辩解。相反地，他们虽然含糊其词并且不提到侵略，但实际上是在谴责侵略，强调他们信奉不干涉小国内政的原则。目前美国代表团正在会外加紧对拉丁美洲国家的代表施加压力，要他们在表决时支持“七国”提案。为此，美国代表团一天几次召集拉丁美洲国家的代表个别地同他们谈话。
