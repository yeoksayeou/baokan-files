Chongqing Dispatch from our reporter Lin Pinglan: “If you don’t understand, learn everywhere; if you don’t have materials, find them everywhere!”; “Turn the construction site into a universal factory, not only as a user of materials, but also as a manufacturer of materials.” Ten thousand young construction workers in Chongqing issued a solemn slogan, launching a “manufacturing one hundred kinds of machines and building materials” campaign.

Chongqing has a large basic construction task this year, and the biggest difficulties currently encountered are the lack of power equipment and building materials. Southwest Fourth Construction Company alone lacks more than one hundred motors and welding machines, and also lacks five thousand tons of cement. Faced with these difficulties, a small number of people said: "There is no equipment or materials, it's not our construction workers' fault. If there isn't any, just wait." But most workers retorted: "Waiting passively does not conform to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. If there is no equipment or materials, we will be determined to manufacture them ourselves."

The young construction workers are all striving hard, learning to manufacture machines and building materials that they have never manufactured before. Wei Guoguang, Wu Xuelong and other five young construction workers from the 44th Engineering Section of the Southwest Fourth Construction Company saw that the engineering section still lacked sixty motors for the mechanization of construction, and they could not be bought on the market. They boldly dismantled an old motor borrowed from elsewhere, studied the structure of the motor, rushed to the Chongqing Electric Factory late at night to learn the operation of each process of manufacturing the motor, and also ran to the library and Xinhua Bookstore to find books on the basic theoretical knowledge of motors. They studied and worked hard, found materials in the waste warehouse, used three paper tubes containing broad bean sauce to replace the winding machine, and used a small knife for peeling fruit to replace the commonly used cutting tools. Without silicon steel sheets, they used heat-treated galvanized iron sheets to quench and temper instead, which basically met the quality requirements. After painstaking research, the insulation, withstand voltage, and other properties have been completely qualified. On July 12, these five laymen finally manufactured a 100-horsepower motor. The steel bar room where they are located has been officially named "Motor Manufacturing Factory". This factory will manufacture sixty to one hundred motors within the year.

The city’s young construction workers are like this, continuously trial-producing 300-grade cement and various building materials and construction machinery such as explosives, jackhammers, and salt water welding. Up to now, under the guidance and assistance of old construction workers, the city’s young construction workers have built nine small factories, manufacturing eighty-five (types) of machines and tools, greatly promoting the movement of construction mechanization.

The activities of Chongqing's young construction workers in carrying out self-manufacturing of machines and building materials not only solved the current contradiction between the increased basic construction tasks and the insufficient and untimely supply of construction equipment, but more importantly, through this activity, they cultivated the young people's communist sense of responsibility and the communist style of daring to overcome difficulties, and changed the old habit of "you buy, I use; if you don't buy, I don't use" in the past; at the same time, they learned various technologies and improved their skills in manufacturing activities.

    把建筑工地变成万能工厂
    重庆青年建筑工人决心自制机具和建筑材料
    本报重庆电  记者林平兰报道：“不懂到处学，没有材料到处找”，“把建筑工地变为万能制造厂，不仅作一个材料的使用者，还要作一个材料的制造者”。重庆市一万名青年建筑工人发出庄严的口号，开展了“制造百种机具和建筑材料”运动。
    重庆市今年基本建设任务大，目前遇到的最大困难是没有动力设备，建筑材料也很缺乏。仅西南第四建筑公司一个单位就缺少电动机、电焊机百部以上，水泥也差五千吨。面对这些困难，有一小部人说：“设备、材料没有，怪不着我们建筑工人。没有，就等着吧。”但多数工人反驳说：“消极等待，不合多快好省方针。设备、材料没有，我们就下决心自己制造。”
    青年建筑工人们个个奋发努力，学习制造从未制造过的机具和建筑材料。西南第四建筑公司四十四工程处青年建筑工人魏国光、吴学龙等五人，看到工程处搞施工机械化还差六十部电动机，市场上又买不到，便大胆地将一部向别处借来的旧电动机拆开，研究电动机构造情况，深夜赶到重庆电工厂去学习制造电动机每一道工序的操作，还跑到图书馆和新华书店寻找有关电动机基本理论知识的书籍。他们苦学苦干，在废料库找来材料，用三个装豆瓣酱的纸筒合起来代替绕线机，将削果皮的小刀代替常用刀具。没有矽钢片，就用白铁皮热处理去淬后来代替，基本上达到了质量要求。经过刻苦钻研，绝缘、耐压等已完全合格，7月12日，这几个外行人终于制成功了一部一百马力的电动机。他们所在的钢筋房已正式命名为“电动机制造厂”。这个厂要在年内制造出六十部到一百部电动机。
    全市青年建筑工人们就像这样，连续试制出了三百号水泥和炸药、风镐、盐水电焊等各种建筑材料和建筑机具。到目前为止，全市青年建筑工人，在老建筑工人的指导和帮助下，已建成九个小工厂，制造出八十五部（种）机器和工具，大大推动了施工机械化运动。
    重庆青年建筑工人开展自制机具和建筑材料的活动，不仅解决了当前基本建设任务增大发生的建筑器材供应不足和不及时的矛盾，更重要的是通过这种活动培养了青年的共产主义责任感和勇于战胜困难的共产主义风格，改变了过去“你买我用，不买不用”的旧习气；同时在制造活动中学到了各种技术，提高了技能。
