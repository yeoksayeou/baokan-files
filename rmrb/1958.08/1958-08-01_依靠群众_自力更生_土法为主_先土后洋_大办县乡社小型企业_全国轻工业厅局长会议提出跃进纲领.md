Rely on the Masses, Self-Reliance, Primarily Indigenous Methods, Indigenous First, Then Foreign
Vigorously Develop Small-Scale Enterprises in Counties, Townships, and Communes
National Conference of Directors of Light Industry Bureaus Proposes Leap Forward Program

(Our Dispatch) Under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, and vigorously developing small-scale enterprises in counties, townships, and communes, prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign ones, and combining indigenous and foreign techniques, are the fundamental keys to the great leap forward in light industry. This is the conclusion reached by the National Conference of Directors of Light Industry Bureaus.

The conference primarily addressed whether a leap forward was necessary for light industry under the premise of the state prioritizing the development of heavy industry, first ensuring the ascent of the three marshals (grain, steel, machinery) and paving the way for the two vanguards (railways, electricity), and how to organize the great leap forward in light industry; and on this basis, arrangements were made for next year's production, and the targets and measures for the second five-year plan were studied.

After discussion, the conference unanimously agreed that light industry must also leap forward in the context of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. A bumper harvest in agriculture and increased grain production inevitably require the development of agricultural product processing industries. The bumper harvests of oil crops, sugarcane, sugar beets, and potatoes require corresponding development of the oil and sugar industries. If these agricultural product processing industries cannot keep up, it will cause losses to the country and dampen the enthusiasm of farmers for production. The situation of agricultural bumper harvests forces light industry to leap forward. On the other hand, after the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, people's lives will also improve accordingly, and people's purchasing power will increase, requiring a large number of consumer goods, and light industry must also produce a large number of products to meet the needs of the people's lives. If light industry does not leap forward, it will not be able to undertake these tasks.

The conference pointed out that in the next two or three years, our country will concentrate its efforts on building heavy industries such as steel, machinery, electricity, and railways, preparing material conditions for the technological transformation of the entire national economy, and the amount of steel and investment allocated to the light industry sector will not be too much. Therefore, light industry must mobilize and rely on the masses to solve problems through self-reliance to ensure a great leap forward in light industry production. The conference criticized the erroneous thinking of some people who, without distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, attempted to develop all industries simultaneously, competing for equipment, steel, and funds, and criticized the waiting mentality of others who waited for the completion of heavy industry construction before developing light industry.

The great leap forward in heavy industry also depends on the supply of many collaborative products from light industry, such as crude salt and its by-products, which must be developed in line with the chemical industry. The products of the glass industry, enamel industry, and leather industry are all necessary for the development of heavy industry, and light industry should support their development.

The main point of the light industry leap forward is to mobilize the masses and implement the policy of prioritizing small-scale enterprises, commune-run enterprises, and indigenous methods. Vigorously develop township and commune-run industries, prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign ones, and combining indigenous and foreign techniques. In the first half of the year, more than one million factories were established nationwide, more than 95% of which were small factories run by townships and communes, which did not require investment, equipment, or steel from the state, and developed rapidly. This fully demonstrates that it is the correct path for the light industry leap forward to let go and mobilize the masses to build many small factories. Of course, all regions should also establish some backbone enterprises to achieve a combination of large, medium, and small-scale enterprises.

The conference focused on studying how to replace steel with ceramics, bamboo, and wood. Currently, some regions have already created bamboo and wood centrifuges, ceramic alcohol distillation towers, ceramic blast furnaces, gas furnaces, centrifugal pumps, double-shaft ball mills, and various chemical acid-resistant ceramic machinery, and wood papermaking machines. Engineering and technical personnel attending the meeting also specifically studied the use of ceramics to manufacture papermaking machines. The conference called on all regions to massively produce and use non-metallic equipment to save a large amount of steel.

    大办县乡社小型企业
    全国轻工业厅局长会议提出跃进纲领
    本报讯　在党的领导下，依靠群众，大办县、乡、社小型企业，先土后洋，土洋结合，是轻工业大跃进的根本关键。这是全国轻工业厅局长会议作出的结论。
    会议主要解决了在国家优先发展重工业的基础上，首先保证三个元帅（粮食、钢铁、机械）升帐、两个先行（铁路、电力）开道的情况下，轻工业需不需要跃进，以及如何组织轻工业大跃进的问题；并在此基础上，安排了明年的生产，研究第二个五年计划的指标和措施。
    会议经过讨论，一致认为轻工业在工农业跃进的形势下，也必须大跃进。农业大丰收，粮食增产，就必然要求发展农产品加工工业，油料、甘蔗、甜菜、薯类等农作物的丰收，就要求油脂工业和制糖工业相应地跟上去，如果这些农产品加工工业跟不上去，就会给国家造成损失，同时，也挫伤了农民生产的积极性。农业大丰收的形势逼迫轻工业非跃进不可。另一方面，工农业大跃进以后，人民生活也有相应改善，人民购买力提高了，需要大批生活资料，而轻工业也必需生产大量产品，满足人民生活的需要。轻工业如不跃进则无法担负起这些任务。
    会议指出，我国在最近两三年内将集中精力举办钢铁、机械、电、铁路等重工业，为整个国民经济的技术改造准备物质条件，分配给轻工业部门的钢材和投资数量不会太多。因此，轻工业必须发动和依靠群众自力更生解决问题，保证轻工业生产大跃进。会议批判了有些人不分轻重缓急，企图百业并举，争设备、争钢铁、争资金的错误思想，批判了另外一些人坐等重工业建设完成之后再来发展轻工业的等待思想。
    重工业大跃进也有待于轻工业中许多协作产品的供应，如原盐及其副产品必须与化工部门发展相适应。玻璃工业、搪瓷工业、制革工业的产品都是发展重工业所必需的，轻工业应该支援它们的发展。
    轻工业跃进的主要一点就是发动群众，贯彻以小型为主，以社办为主，以土法为主的方针。大力发展乡、社办工业，先土后洋、土洋结合。上半年全国办了一百多万个厂，95％以上都是乡、社办的小型工厂，既没有向国家要投资，也没有向国家要设备，要钢材，发展的很快。这充分证明了放手发动群众，依靠群众多办小厂，是轻工业跃进的正确道路。当然，各地也要举办一些骨干企业，做到大、中、小相结合。
    会议着重研究了如何用陶瓷、竹木代替钢铁的问题。目前有的地区已经创造了竹木离心机，陶瓷酒精蒸馏塔，陶瓷鼓风炉，煤气炉，离心泵，双轴球磨机，以及各种化学耐酸陶瓷机械，木制造纸机。出席会议的工程技术人员还专门研究了用陶瓷制造造纸机的问题。会议要求各地大量生产和采用非金属设备，以节约大量钢材。
