　　Simple Rapid Bearing Machine is Five Times Faster Than a Lathe
　　*Dazhong Daily* News: The Farm Implement Manufacturing and Repair Factory in Ningyang County, Shandong Province, has successfully created a simple and rapid bearing machine, which plays a significant role in ensuring the early realization of bearingization throughout the county.
　　In order to accelerate the realization of bearingization, Xiao Yuan'e from the machine tool workshop proposed that the inner and outer rings could be produced using an upper and lower pressing groove method instead of a lathe. With the active support and assistance of the leadership, continuous experiments were conducted, and success was achieved on the 14th.
　　This method is very simple and can be done by ordinary blacksmiths. Two pieces of wrought iron are used to make tools with upper and lower pressing grooves. Two grooves are dug in the middle, and after quenching, the iron ring of the bearing is placed in the middle and hammered a few times. Workers call this tool a simple rapid bearing machine. Using this tool, forty to sixty sets of inner and outer rings can be produced per hour, increasing efficiency by five to seven times compared to using a lathe. Recently, worker Yang Hongxian proposed to build a "small mother machine," which can be used to produce a simple rapid bearing machine per hour. If all 126 agricultural cooperatives in the county universally use simple bearing machines, 40,000 sets of bearings can be produced in one day, and the task of needing 80,000 sets of bearings for the entire county can be completed in two days.

　　简易快速轴承机比车床还快五倍
    大众日报消息　山东宁阳县农具制修厂，创制成功了简易快速轴承机，对保证提前实现全县轴承化作用很大。
    为了加速实现轴承化，机床车间萧元峨提出可以不用车床，而用上下压槽的办法生产内外套的意见。经领导积极支持帮助，连续试验，在14日试验成功。
    这种办法很简单，普通的铁匠都可作。用两块熟铁打成上下压槽的工具，中间挖两道槽沟，淬火后将轴承的铁圈放在中间，用锤打几下就成了，工人们把这种工具叫做简易快速轴承机。用这种工具，每小时可生产内外套四十至六十套，比用车床的效率提高五倍至七倍。最近工人杨洪宪又提议造了一部“小母机”，用它每小时就可生产出一台简易快速轴承机。如果全县一百二十六处农业社都普遍用上简易轴承机后，一天就能生产四万套轴承，两天就能完成全县需要八万套轴承的任务。
