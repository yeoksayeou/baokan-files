After the Elimination of Illiteracy
　　——A Record of the Great Leap Forward in Mass Cultural Learning in Dengfeng County
　　Miao Huaming, Second Secretary of the Dengfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　New things bring new problems.
　　After Dengfeng County, Henan Province, completed its task of eliminating illiteracy, new problems arose in our work. Although we had already created the experience of "eliminate a batch, transform a batch, consolidate a batch" in the previous process of eliminating illiteracy, it was a new problem to transfer tens of thousands of young adults who had shed their illiteracy at the same time into spare-time primary schools, and nearly ten thousand people who had reached the graduation level of higher primary schools into spare-time junior high schools. Because we underestimated the development speed of the mass cultural learning movement, we were very insufficient in terms of ideological and material preparation, especially in the preparation of the number and quality of teachers, which was far behind the actual needs. It was very difficult to complete this glorious task. At this time, we were faced with the following question: Should we seize the favorable opportunity, overcome difficulties, bravely keep up with the situation, and immediately popularize spare-time cultural education for young adults? Or should we hesitate, miss the opportunity, repeat the past lessons, and create "illiteracy relapse" again? We adopted the former attitude, not the latter. The facts of nearly four months have proved that by relying on the masses, overcoming difficulties, and rapidly popularizing spare-time cultural education for young adults, significant achievements have been made in learning and production. Recalling that at that time, some cultural and educational workers in our county had expressed doubts and endless worries about this approach. They believed that the work of eliminating illiteracy completed by means of mass movement was impossible to consolidate; they doubted whether it was appropriate to immediately popularize spare-time cultural education before adequate preparations were made in terms of teachers; they were also worried about whether the teaching quality could be improved after popularization. Because they were bound by right-leaning conservative ideas at that time, they did not dare to think boldly before new things sprouted; when new things had already appeared, they still did not dare to act boldly. Their thinking always lagged behind the development of the situation, and this work gave them another profound lesson.

　　Strike While the Iron Is Hot, Leap Forward Boldly
　　Immediately popularizing spare-time cultural education after completing the task of eliminating illiteracy is not only a necessary step in the work, but also an urgent demand of the broad masses; only in this way can we avoid repeating the lesson of "illiteracy relapse." At that time, the masses had already put forward the demand: "Every team has a spare-time primary school, every commune has a spare-time middle school, every township has a spare-time high school, and all cadres go to red and expert schools"; their slogan was: "Cultural atomic explosion, universal education blossoms everywhere." When Ma Youku was unwilling to go to school again, his son Ma Depo criticized him on the blackboard, saying: "Call father, listen to my words, let's talk about cultural learning: you just graduated from illiteracy elimination, sitting at home not reading; if this goes on for half a year, everything you learned will be forgotten; I advise you to go back to school, and strive to be a model in production and learning." Sun Hulai, a 53-year-old private school teacher, said: "Circle out the twilight, the vigor breaks through the sky, although I am fifty-three, I am determined to be red and expert"; the oath of the old teacher Wang Yuanwu, "I, Wang Yuanwu, am an old man in my sixties, regardless of deafness and blurred vision, I am determined to erupt like a raging fire, and turn illiterates into scientists," is such a great encouragement to the younger generation! Faced with such a high tide of mass sentiment, the Party's attitude should be to firmly support it. On March 5, the day after the announcement of the realization of an illiteracy-free county, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Mu Fuzhen, personally presided over the Gucheng Conference. On the basis of affirming the achievements already made, he called on all young adults in the county to take advantage of the victory to march towards culture and science. More than 470 district and township cadres, League branch secretaries, and private school teachers who attended the meeting unanimously stated that they would popularize spare-time cultural education for young adults and cadre red and expert schools within seven days. The momentum was huge, the development was rapid, and the achievements were amazing. When Wang Fuxiu, Secretary of the Daye District Committee, explained the favorable situation and glorious tasks at the time to the mass meeting in Daye Town, he fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools, attending schools, and private school teachers. On the same day, he made comprehensive arrangements for the work of classrooms, teaching aids, teacher division of labor, and student organization; through organizing visits, the entire district achieved the popularization of spare-time cultural learning organizations for young adults and cadres within three days. Liu Bei Commune only used fifteen sheets of paper (to hold class placement tests) to build three spare-time primary school classes and two spare-time junior high school classes; the commune's carpentry team completed fifty desks and benches in one day and one night. Other districts also completed the task of popularization within a week under the slogan of "the secretary takes action, the whole party mobilizes, and the whole people run schools." The solution to specific problems was generally taken in this way: school buildings and school equipment were solved by agricultural cooperatives or students brought their own desks and benches; funds were subsidized by the commune's public welfare fund; teachers' work loss was solved by the commune or students jointly exchanged work points. Among the teachers, transferred cadres, cultural demobilized soldiers, and intellectuals and old intellectuals in the countryside who had not yet been absorbed into private schools as teachers were added; private school teachers with poor cultural skills were used to teach first and second grade students in elementary school to recognize characters, and elementary school teachers with higher cultural levels were transferred to teach spare-time junior high school. Politically, resolutely not using right-wing elements and intellectuals from landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements maintained the purity of the private school teacher team. A total of 2,529 private school teachers were organized in the county, and 34 high school classes, 398 junior high school classes, 1,424 higher primary school classes, and 215 red and expert school classes were built, with a total of 61,692 students; there were still 1,255 illiteracy elimination classes, with 21,870 students, including 8,131 elderly illiterates aged 40 to 50. Eighty-year-old Fan Suixiu's family of three generations were in the same classroom; Bai Guiyong's family of three generations were all middle school students; and Grandma Liu, who was eighty-two years old, was also unwilling to wear the illiteracy hat into the coffin and actively participated in learning. There is a folk song that writes: "A table is square, a lamp is placed in the center, the whole family sits together, grandpa, grandma, father and mother, I stand aside and often instruct, explaining the meaning of each word in detail, grandpa smiles and praises me, our family has produced a champion!" The result of striking while the iron is hot and leaping forward boldly has broken through all the rules and regulations and right-leaning conservative ideas of the masses and cadres on spare-time cultural education work. This is another great victory after the completion of the task of eliminating illiteracy.

　　Improve Teachers, Improve Teaching, Improve the Masses
　　In the past, the people of Dengfeng County were in a backward state of "poor and blank" in their economic and cultural life for a long time. Only because of the efforts after liberation, especially under the illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and in the situation of the overall leap forward of socialism, could the people's economic and cultural life undergo such fundamental changes. However, because the number and quality of the intellectual ranks cannot meet the requirements of the rapid development of today's socialist construction, not only is there a shortage of teachers, but also in order to develop local industry (including fertilizer manufacturing) and train agricultural production technicians, some private school teachers have been transferred, and the newly adjusted private school teacher team is not yet proficient in the new tasks. Some private school teachers only have the experience of eliminating illiteracy, but no experience in teaching middle and primary schools, and some have never done teaching work; coupled with the fact that some leading cadres and some students had slackening thoughts at that time, it would be impossible to consolidate and improve without overcoming these difficulties. Therefore, we took many effective measures at that time to improve the teacher team, improve teaching, and improve the masses. (1) Established middle school private school teacher guidance areas centered on public middle schools and primary school private school teacher guidance areas centered on public primary schools, organizing private school teachers to improve themselves once a week; (2) Established teaching research groups by subject, private school teachers and public school teachers (including new and old teachers) were mixed into groups, preparing lessons together and improving together; (3) Teachers took apprentices, supplementing what was lacking, teaching what was learned, and developing together; (4) Public school teachers gave demonstration lectures, and private school teachers taught after listening; (5) New and old teachers listened to each other's lectures, new teachers learned teaching experience, and old teachers provided specific guidance; (6) The Education Bureau designated special personnel to go deep into key schools to cultivate typical examples, summarize experience, and organize visits and comparisons in a timely manner to comprehensively promote. Since the Gucheng Conference on March 6, the Education Bureau led private school teachers to Shilipu, Jietou Township, Sanguanmiao Township, and Kuzhuang Township in mid-April to conduct roving visits and comparisons; on May 4, it held the Haidu Conference to organize a writing upsurge and an agricultural tool reform movement; on May 21, it held a meeting in Beiyangpo to study non-stop during the wheat harvest. Through these meetings, the leadership was strengthened, and the key problems that appeared in a certain period were solved, and it quickly got on the right track. Students reflected: "The teachers' lectures are much better than in the past." Under the encouragement of the plan to "read ten thousand books and write ten thousand articles," students in the Junzhao District implemented "standing up to produce, sitting down to write," and wrote 331,050 articles in five days. In the Baiyin'an teacher class of Beiyangpo Spare-time Middle School, they studied two lessons and wrote two allegro poems each during the three-day manure transportation assault. All the students in the village wrote more than 15,000 literary works reflecting production and life in three months. As a result of this, four parties were satisfied: (1) The township and commune were satisfied: they learned the technology and improved the quality of production; (2) The family was satisfied: they went to school to learn skills, and their income increased even more; (3) The students were satisfied: they were active in both production and learning, and everyone strived to be a dual model; (4) The masses were satisfied: they strengthened publicity and education activities, and inspired the masses' production enthusiasm. They all praised in unison: "Chairman Mao's idea is really good."

　　Serve Production, Promote Production, Improve Awareness
　　We have accepted the experience and lessons learned in the process of eliminating illiteracy, and our guiding ideology and policy for organizing mass cultural learning is very firm and clear. The task of mass spare-time cultural education is not only to consolidate the results of eliminating illiteracy and continue to improve the cultural living standards of the masses, but more importantly, to serve production and promote production, improve socialist awareness, and accelerate socialist construction. Therefore, in the content of learning, time arrangement, learning places, learning system, and all learning methods, we must clearly and effectively serve production, promote production, and improve the socialist awareness of the people; otherwise, it will inevitably be separated from the masses, and even cause political errors that hinder the development of production. The "three unification, four follow and four walks, five changes, and ten belts" methods that we are currently promoting throughout the county have achieved great results. The three unifications are: "Unified arrangement of production and learning time, unified evaluation of production and learning results, and unified collaboration of cadres and private school teachers"; the four follow and four walks are: "Books follow people, content follows production, teachers follow students, and classrooms follow production sites"; the five changes are: "Change private schools into places for mobilizing production, change private school learning classes into production teams, change production rest time into learning time, change private school teachers into assistants to production teams, and change private school students into agricultural technicians"; the ten belts are: "Production tools, textbooks, newspapers, homework notebooks, exercise books, pens, books, small blackboards, mobile wall newspapers, and fly swatters." In order to ensure that learning is adhered to during the wheat harvest, five sets of organizations were established: (1) primary school teachers, (2) primary and middle school students, (3) township and commune cadres, (4) social intellectuals, (5) private school teachers and students, dividing areas and contracting, villages have people in charge, levels have people in special charge, and someone reports every day, requiring that there be classrooms in the fields, blackboards in the wheat fields, writing when something is seen, and reviewing when there is time; people who cut wheat rest and learn, people who carry wheat learn when they have time, people who watch the field learn at night, and people who turn the field learn in the morning, to achieve a double harvest of production and culture. If we had not started from the urgent demands of the masses after completing the task of eliminating illiteracy, and had not popularized mass spare-time cultural education in a timely manner, and continued to carry out a lively cultural learning, it would have been impossible to achieve such amazing results in a short period of time.

　　Another important reason for being able to achieve the above achievements is that we closely combined the current production reality and political and ideological movements in teaching ideology and teaching content. Teachers personally wrote textbooks, such as local language textbooks, industrial and agricultural technology textbooks, and spare-time school arithmetic textbooks. The method of combining with the socialist debate and mobilizing private school students to take the lead further improved the students' political awareness, and also correspondingly improved the enthusiasm of the masses, and effectively cooperated with and promoted the central work of a certain period. When Shuiyu Township carried out the Double-Anti Movement, student Guo Yunlai used allegro poems to criticize Wang Zhanxian, saying: "Beat the leap forward bell, blow the leap forward horn; ask Wang Zhanxian, do you know? You are not active in meetings, you don't go to school; when you meet the opening of work points, you always fight for it; when others criticize you, you still complain; what kind of thinking is this, please examine yourself quickly!" There are countless such vivid examples.

　　Popularizing Red and Expert Universities in Two Days
　　Young adult farmers are less influenced by feudalism and capitalism education, they have the least superstition, are the easiest to accept new things, and are the most able to give play to creativity. After shedding their illiteracy, they urgently demand to learn culture and science. While the county was generally promoting the cadre red and expert schools created by Sanguanmiao Township, Wencun Township created water conservancy colleges, agricultural colleges, and women's universities that closely combined cadres and the masses, learning and production, theory and practice, and mental labor and physical labor; after local expert Zhang Guangyi returned to his hometown from Beijing to participate in the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, in order to adapt to the urgent need to develop production and reform agricultural tools, he immediately established an agricultural machinery college including five departments: design, drawing, manufacturing, wood, and iron. When the Henan Daily introduced the experience of Yucheng Jushan and Mengjin County Zhaiquan Commune in establishing agricultural universities, especially after studying the editorial "Break Superstition and Run Universities" and hearing the Dengfeng County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issue a call to the people of the county to "run universities throughout the county, make the whole people red and expert, and march towards culture and science," the party organizations and the vast number of cadres in many townships and communes immediately made plans. In just two days, 44 red and expert universities were established throughout the county, and more than 117,000 cadres and people participated in the red and expert university learning, accounting for more than one-third of the county's population of 300,000. Their slogan is: "There are no mountains that cannot be split, no torrents that cannot be cut off, with high ambition and great determination, we must be red scientists with both culture and martial arts." After breaking through right-leaning conservative thinking, the staff of the Dengfeng County directly affiliated organs, led by the secretary and department leading cadres, immediately established a red and expert university including Marxism-Leninism, administration, industrial technology, agricultural technology, publicity and health science, finance and economics, and politics seven colleges and thirty-eight departments. The learning method is to concentrate on learning politics, learn technology by department, learn culture by class, and establish experimental fields by department; the capable are teachers, the incapable are apprentices, teachers and apprentices help each other, teach and learn from each other, and politics, culture, and technology are advanced simultaneously, forming a lively learning upsurge. Of course, at present, many people still doubt whether farmers can run universities and whether such schools are "universities." During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to win the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, many universities were held in various anti-Japanese base areas, and these universities trained countless excellent and talented military experts. In today's great leap forward in agricultural production, such agricultural universities will inevitably train a large number of excellent agricultural scientists. For those who take a skeptical attitude towards new things, it is best to let them carefully study the party's historical experience and go to actual life in person.

　　New Types of Intellectuals in the Countryside
　　Most of the intellectuals we usually talk about are trained in schools that are completely divorced from actual social life. They have book knowledge, and some can also "write thousands of words"; but when they come into contact with actual life, they will feel that they know too little or are "ignorant"; the articles they write are often "meaningless." However, after the peasants have mastered the tool of writing, they can not only read and write, but also apply their wisdom to the reform of agricultural tools, the technical reform of crops, and the creation of inventions. If it is said that the former type of intellectuals can bloom and bear fruit if they apply their book knowledge to actual life, then the contribution of these peasants with rich agricultural production knowledge and class struggle training to technical reform and people's cultural life will be even greater after they have a certain cultural level. Hasn't this been proven by real life? Zhang Guangyi's achievements in tool creation and invention are already one of the models praised and learned by the people of the county, the province, and the country. At the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, he can not only introduce his invention and creation experience in an orderly manner, but also carefully draw patterns to learn from others in order to continue to move forward; Fan Yukun, the director of the Science and Technology Research Office of the October Cultural Commune, was a shepherd boy who dared not dream of going to school in the old society, but when he was approved to transfer to the middle school class shortly after shedding his illiteracy hat, he was able to quickly apply the sweet potato warm soup seedling breeding method, corn three-attack fertilization method, male removal hybridization method, vernalization wheat method, millet seedling method, and moonflower frame grafting sweet potato method introduced in the plant textbook to his own experimental fields and large-scale farming areas, and achieved abundant production results and abundant production experience; at present, when ordinary millet is still in the seedling state, the vernalization millet he experimented with has already produced full ears. He has no analyzer, no microscope, but goes deep into the fields, gullies and slopes to experiment. Using this method will create greater and more results on the basis of continuous improvement of cultural and scientific level. When Fan Hailiang, who had been a long-term worker for the landlords for generations, shed his illiteracy hat and learned to abacus, he abolished the landlord accountant and truly became the master of the new society; now he can write allegro poems, essays, and five-act plays; Chen Wenxue, a worker in the local iron smelting, does not understand physics and chemistry, but after several nights of sleepless hard experiments, he created the advanced experience of smelting iron with yellow coal and yellow soil; the students of Haidu Village Civil School, under the encouragement of the vivid slogan of "Learning Zhuge, Catching Luban, and Winning the Championship in Technological Revolution," created more than 300 kinds of more than 3,000 agricultural tools and realized semi-mechanization; Liu Kubai, a student of Beiyinpo Civil School, invented twelve pieces by himself. Liu Guoyan, a student of the Civil School, wrote in his allegro poem: "Leap, leap, leap and turn, turn, turn, the technological revolution is the most important thing, forget to eat for the sake of invention, and do it again after thousands of failures; skilled craftsmen offer their plans, and all the old agricultural tools are completely changed." So many amazing miracles were difficult for anyone to imagine before the task of eliminating illiteracy was completed and spare-time cultural education was popularized. After continuing to learn and improve in this way, more and greater miracles will be created on the basis of the great leap forward of "one day is equal to twenty years"!

　　在扫盲完成以后
　　——记登封县群众文化学习的大跃进
　　中共登封县委第二书记　苗化铭
    新事物带来了新问题
    河南省登封县在完成了扫盲任务之后，工作上带来了新问题，虽然我们在已往的扫盲工作过程中已经创造了“扫一批，转一批，巩固一批”的经验；但是要在同一时期把数万个摘掉文盲帽的青壮年都转入业余小学和已经达到高小毕业的近万人也都转入业余初中，却是一个新问题。由于我们对群众性的文化学习运动发展速度估计不足，在思想上和物质准备上都是很不够的，特别是在教师的数量和质量的准备工作方面更远远落后于实际需要，要完成这一光荣任务，困难是很大的。这时在我们面前摆着这样的问题：是抓紧有利时机，克服困难，勇敢地跟上去，立即普及青壮年业余文化教育呢？还是犹豫迟疑，坐失时机，重复以往的教训，再造成“扫盲回生”呢？我们采取的态度是前者不是后者。将近四个月的事实证明，由于依靠群众，克服困难，迅速地普及了青壮年业余文化教育，在学习上和生产上，都已经获得了显著的成绩。回忆当时我县的部分文教工作者对这种作法是曾经表示过怀疑和无限忧虑的。他们认为采用群众运动方式完成的扫盲工作是不可能巩固的；他们怀疑在师资方面没有作好充分的准备工作之前，立即普及业余文化教育是否妥当？他们还忧虑在普及之后，教学质量能不能提高？由于他们当时受到了右倾保守思想的束缚，在新事物萌芽之前，不敢大胆地想；当新事物已经出现之后，仍然不敢大胆地干。他们的思想总是落在形势发展的后面，在这个工作上，又给了他们一个很深刻的教训。
    趁热打铁　大胆跃进
    扫盲任务完成后，立即普及业余文化教育，这不仅是必然的工作步骤，而且是广大群众的迫切要求；也只有这样，才不致于重复“扫盲回生”的教训。当时群众已经提出要求：“队队有业小，社社有业中，乡乡有业高，干部都上红专学校”；他们的口号是：“文化原子大爆炸，普及教育齐开花”。当马有库不愿再上学时，他的儿子马德坡就在黑板上提出批评说：“叫父亲，听我言，文化学习谈一谈：你扫盲刚才毕了业，坐在家里书不念；这样下去有半年，你所学的都忘完；劝你再把学来上，生产学习争模范”。五十三岁的民校教师孙乎来说：“暮气一笔圈，朝气冲破天，我虽五十三，立志红又专”；老教师王元戊“我王元戊年迈花甲，不顾耳聋眼花，决心像烈火爆发，要把文盲变成科学家”的誓言，对青年一代是多么大的鼓舞啊！面对着群众情绪这样高涨的现实，党的态度应该是坚决地给以支持。在3月5日宣布实现无文盲县的第二天，县委毋福珍副书记亲自主持召开了告成会议，在肯定已经取得的成绩的基础上，号召全县青壮年乘胜向文化科学进军。到会的区、乡干部，团支部书记，民校教师等四百七十多人都一致表示要在七天内普及青壮年业余文化教育和干部红专学校。声势浩大，发展迅速，成绩惊人。当大冶区委书记王福修同志在大冶镇群众大会上说明了当时的有利形势和光荣任务后，充分发动了群众办学、群众上学和民校教师们的积极性，当天即对教室、教具、教师分工和学生组织等方面的工作作好了全面安排；又通过组织参观，全区在三天内实现了普及青壮年群众和干部的业余文化学习组织工作。刘碑社只用了十五张纸（举行编班测验），即建成了三班业余小学和两班业余初中；这个社的木工组一天一夜突击完成了五十副桌凳。其他各区也都在“书记动手，全党动员，全民办学”的口号下，在一周内完成了普及任务。对具体问题的解决大体上都是采取这样的方法：校舍、校具由农业社解决或由学生自带桌凳；经费由社公益金补助；教师误工由社解决或由学员共同兑工分。在教师中又增加了下放干部，有文化的转业军人以及尚未被吸收到民校当教师的在乡知识分子和旧知识分子；又用文化较差的民校教师教初小一、二年级学生认字，调换文化水平较高的小学教师教业余初中。在政治上坚决不用右派分子和地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子中的知识分子，保持了民校教师队伍的纯洁。全县共组织民校教师二千五百二十九人，建成高中三十四班，初中三百九十八班，高小一千四百二十四班，红专学校二百一十五班，学员共六万一千六百九十二人；尚有扫盲班一千二百五十五班，学员二万一千八百七十人，其中有四十到五十岁的老年文盲八千一百三十一人。八十岁老人范遂秀一家三代同课堂；白贵永一家三代都是中学生；八十二岁的刘二奶奶也不愿带着文盲帽子进棺材而积极参加学习。有一首民谣这样写道：“一张桌四四方，一盏灯放在中央，全家人坐一起，爷爷奶奶和爹娘，我站在一旁常指教，一字一意说端详，爷爷笑着夸奖我，咱家出了个状元！”趁热打铁，大胆跃进的结果，突破了群众和干部对业余文化教育工作的一切清规戒律和右倾保守思想。这是在扫盲任务完成后的又一个大胜利。
　  提高教师　提高教学　提高群众
    登封县人民在经济文化生活上过去是长期处在“又穷又白”的落后状态，只是由于解放后的努力，特别是在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线照耀下，在社会主义全面跃进形势下，人民的经济文化生活才能够发生这样根本性的变化。但是，由于知识分子队伍在数量上和质量上都不能适应今天社会主义建设事业迅速发展的要求，不仅师资不足，而且为了要发展地方工业（包括化肥制造）和培训农业生产技术人员，一部分民校教师被调换了，新调整的民校教师队伍对新的任务还不熟练，部分民校教师只有扫盲经验，没有教中、小学的经验，有的从来没有作过教学工作；加上部分领导干部和部分学员当时曾产生松劲思想，不克服这些困难，就无法巩固提高。因此，我们当时曾采取了很多有效的措施，提高了教师队伍，提高了教学，提高了群众。（1）建立了以公立中学为中心的中学民校教师辅导区和以公立小学为中心的小学民校教师辅导区，组织民校教师每星期进修一次；（2）分科建立教学研究组，民校教师随同公立学校教师（包括新教师和老教师）混合编组，共同备课，共同提高；（3）老师带徒弟，缺啥补啥，教啥学啥，共同发展；（4）公立学校教师讲课示范，民校教师听课后进行传授；（5）新老教师互相听课，新教师学习教学经验，老教师进行具体辅导；（6）教育局确定专人深入重点学校培养典型，总结经验，及时组织参观评比，全面推进。自3月6日告成会议后，教育局在4月中旬带领民校教师到十里铺、界头乡、三官庙乡、库庄乡进行巡回参观评比；5月4日召开了海堵会议，组织写作高潮和农具改革运动；5月21日在背阳坡召开了麦收不停学习的会议。通过这些会议加强了领导，解决了在一定的时期中出现的关键问题，很快的走上了正轨，学生反映：“老师讲的就是比过去好的多了”。君召区学员在“读万本书写万篇文”的计划鼓舞下，实行了“站起来生产，坐下来写作”，在五天内写成了三十三万一千零五十篇。背阳坡业余中学白银安教师班，在三天完成运粪突击活动中，学习了两课书，每人还写了两篇快板诗，该村全体学员三个月内写出了一万五千多篇反映生产和生活的文艺作品。这样作的结果，得到了四满意，（1）乡、社满意：学习了技术，提高了生产质量；（2）家庭满意：上学学本事，收入更增加；（3）学生满意：生产学习两积极，人人争取双模范；（4）群众满意：加强宣传教育活动，鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。他们都异口同声的称赞说：“毛主席想的办法真正好”。
　  服务生产　推进生产　提高觉悟
    我们接受了在扫盲工作过程中的经验教训，对组织群众文化学习的指导思想和方针是十分坚定明确的。群众业余文化教育的任务，不仅是为了巩固扫盲成果，继续提高群众的文化生活水平，更重要的是服务生产和推进生产，提高社会主义觉悟，加快社会主义建设。因此，在学习内容、时间安排、学习场所、学习制度和一切有关学习方式上，都必须明确有效地服务生产，推进生产，提高人民群众的社会主义觉悟；否则必然会脱离群众，甚至造成妨碍生产发展的政治错误。我们正在全县范围内推行着的“三统一、四跟四走、五变、十带”等办法，已经收到了巨大效果。三统一是：“生产学习时间统一安排，生产学习成绩统一评比，干部民师统一协作”；四跟四走是：“书本跟人走，内容跟生产走，教师跟学员走，课堂跟生产场所走”；五变是：“变民校为发动生产的场所，变民校学习班为生产队，变生产休息时间为学习时间，变民校教师为生产队的助手，变民校学员为农业技术员”；十带是：“生产工具、课本、报纸、作业笔记、练习本、钢笔、图书、小黑板、流动墙报、蝇子拍”。为了保证在麦收中坚持学习，成立了五套组织：（1）小学教师，（2）中小学生，（3）乡、社干部，（4）社会知识分子，（5）民校师生，分片包干，村村有人负责，层层有人专管，天天有人汇报，要求作到地头有课堂，麦场有黑板，见事就写作，有空就复习；割麦的人休息学，担麦的人趁空学，看场的人晚上学，翻场的人上午学，达到生产文化双丰收。如果我们在完成扫盲任务之后不是从群众的迫切要求出发，及时地普及了群众业余文化教育，继续开展了热火朝天的文化学习，要在短时间内取得这样惊人的成绩是不可能的。
    所以能够取得以上成就的又一重要原因，就是我们在教学思想上和教学内容上密切结合了当前的生产实际和政治思想运动，教师们自己动手编写教材，如语文乡土教材，工农业技术教材，业余学校算术教材，以及用结合社会主义大辩论，发动民校学员起带头作用的方法更加提高了学员的政治觉悟，同时也相应地提高了群众的积极性，有力地配合和推进了一定时期的中心工作。当水峪乡开展双反鸣放时，学员郭云来用快板诗批评王占现说：“打起跃进钟，吹起跃进号；问问王占现，你知道不知道？开会不积极，上学你不到；遇见开工分，总是争着要；别人批评你，你还发牢骚；这是啥思想，请你快检讨！”这样生动的事例，真是不胜枚举。
        两天普及红专大学
    青壮年农民受封建主义和资本主义教育的影响较少，他们迷信最少，最容易接受新鲜事物，最能够发挥创造性。他们在摘掉文盲帽子以后，迫切要求学习文化科学。在全县普遍推广三官庙乡创办的干部红专学校的同时，文村乡创办了干部和群众、学习和生产、理论和实际、脑力劳动和体力劳动密切结合的水利学院、农业学院、妇女大学；土专家张广义由北京参加全国农具展览会回乡后，为了适应发展生产、改革农具的迫切需要，立即建立了包括设计、绘图、制造、木、铁、工等五个科的农业机械学院。当河南日报介绍了禹县鸠山和孟津县翟泉社创办农业大学的经验特别是学习了“打破迷信办大学”的社论和听到中共登封县委向全县人民发出“全县办大学，全民红又专，向文化科学大进军”的号召以后，不少乡社的党组织和广大干部立即进行规划，只有两天时间，就在全县范围内建立了四十四个红专大学，参加红专大学学习的干部和群众已经有十一万七千余人，占全县三十万人口的三分之一以上。他们的口号是：“没有劈不开的大山，没有斩不断的洪流，志气高，决心大，要当文武双全的红色科学家。”登封县直属机关工作人员在打破右倾保守思想之后，由书记挂帅，部门领导干部带头，立即建立了包括马列主义、行政、工业技术、农业技术、宣传卫生科学、财经、政治七个学院和三十八个学系的红专大学，学习的办法是集中学政治，分系学技术，分班学文化，分系建立试验田；能者为师，不能者为徒，师徒相帮，互教互学，政治、文化、技术同时并进，形成了热火朝天的学习高潮。当然，当前有不少人还在怀疑农民能不能办大学和这样的学校算不算“大学”。抗日战争时期，在各个抗日根据地为了争取抗战胜利，曾经举办过许多大学，这些大学培养出无数优秀的天才的军事专家。在今天的农业生产大跃进中，这样的农业大学也必然会培养出大量的优秀的农业科学家。对于那些在新事物面前采取怀疑态度的人，最好是让他们认真学习党的历史经验和亲自到实际生活中去吧。
    农村中新型的知识分子
    我们通常所说的知识分子，多数是从同社会实际生活完全脱离关系的学校中培养出来的，他们有书本知识，有的也能“提笔万言”；但是当他们一接触到实际生活，就会感到自己知道的太少或者是“无知”的；他们写出的文章也往往是“言之无物”。但是农民在掌握了文字工具之后，不仅能读能写，而且能够把他们的智慧运用到农具改革、农作物技术改革和创造发明上去。如果说前一种知识分子能够把自己的书本知识运用到实际生活中就可以开花结果的话，那么这些具有丰富的农业生产知识和阶级斗争锻炼的农民，有了一定的文化水平之后，在技术改革和人民文化生活方面的贡献，将是更加巨大的，这不是已经为现实生活所证明了吗？张广义在工具创造发明方面的成就，已经是全县全省和全国人民称赞学习的榜样之一，他在全国农具展览会上不仅能够有条理的介绍自己的发明创造经验，而且还能够细心地绘制图样向人家学习，以求继续前进；十月文化社的科学技术研究室主任范玉坤，在旧社会是不敢梦想上学的放羊孩子，但是当他摘掉文盲帽不久被批准转入中学班时，就能很快地把植物课本上所介绍的红薯温汤育种法、玉米三攻施肥法、去雄杂交法、春化小麦法、谷子催青法、月光花架接红薯法运用到自己的试验田里和大块耕作面积上，取到了丰产效果和丰产经验；当前在一般谷子还正在发苗状态时期，他所实验的春化谷子已经出齐穗了。他没有化验器，没有显微镜，而是深入田间山沟和山坡去实验。运用这种方法将会在文化科学水平继续提高的基础上，创造出更大更多的成果。当世世代代给地主当长工的范海亮摘掉文盲帽和学会打算盘之后，就撤销了地主会计，真正当了新社会的主人；现在他已经会写快板诗、散文、五幕的剧本；土法炼铁工人陈文学不懂物理化学，只是经过几夜不睡觉的刻苦实验，就创造了用黄煤加黄土炼铁的先进经验；海堵村民校学员在“学诸葛，赶鲁班，技术革命夺状元”的生动口号鼓舞下，创造了三百多种三千多件农具，实现了半机械化；背阴坡民校学生刘库白一人发明了十二件。民校学员刘国炎的快板诗上这样写道：“跃跃跃来翻翻翻，技术革命最当先，为发明来忘吃饭，失败千次还要干；能工巧匠把计献，旧式农具全改完。”这样多的惊人奇迹，在未完成扫盲任务和普及业余文化教育之前，是谁也难以想像的。在这样继续学习提高之后，将会在“一天等于二十年”的大跃进基础上，创造出更多更大的奇迹！
