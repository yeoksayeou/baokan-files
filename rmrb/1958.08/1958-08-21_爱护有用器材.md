Column: Reader's Letters and Commentary

　　In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials such as steel during the Great Leap Forward in industry, many provinces and cities have launched a large-scale industrial "drought resistance" campaign. Through this campaign, many regions can solve the problem of raw materials self-reliantly, creating favorable conditions for completing this year's production leap forward plan.
    However, judging from the reader letters we have recently received regarding the issue of industrial "drought resistance," there are some shortcomings in the methods used in some places. For example, in a letter from Wu Zhaoxiang and three other comrades from the Xiamen Navigation Administration Bureau of Fujian Province, it was mentioned that in order to complete the task of industrial "drought resistance," the bureau dismantled the "Inushima Maru," a ship that could have been salvaged as a whole, when salvaging sunken ships. As a result, this large ship, which could have been used with minor repairs, was turned into a pile of scrap iron. Liu Huige, a comrade from the Liaoyang County Coal Construction Store in Liaoning Province, wrote that during the industrial "drought resistance" movement, some residents and cadres in Liaoyang County dismantled steel bars from many public buildings, iron pipes from sewers, and iron grates from dirty water wells on both sides of the road, and handed them over as scrap iron. Some people even took away useful equipment such as steel pipes and large pots stored in the factory yard for later use, treating them as scrap steel.
    It can be seen from these letters that some comrades do not have a clear understanding of the significance of the industrial "drought resistance" movement. The main purpose of this movement is to mobilize the power of the masses, so that everyone uses their brains and hands to thoroughly excavate all useless steel and other metal materials and idle machinery and equipment from all aspects and corners, and use them for industrial production. To turn all dead things into living things, and all waste into useful things, to support production and construction. Now, some places are dismantling complete ships and equipment into scrap iron for "drought resistance," isn't this turning living things into dead things? According to reader letters, it costs more than one million yuan to build a large ship like the "Inushima Maru," but the steel salvaged after dismantling it is not even worth 100,000 yuan. Isn't this a case of losing more than one gains?
    We hope that relevant departments in various regions will pay attention to this issue.

　　爱护有用器材
    为了克服工业大跃进中钢铁等原材料不足的困难，许多省市开展了声势浩大的工业“抗旱”运动。通过这个运动，不少地区可以自力更生地解决原材料问题，为完成今年的生产跃进计划创造良好条件。
    但是，从我们最近收到的有关工业“抗旱”问题的读者来信看来，有的地方在作法上有一些缺点。例如，福建省厦门航管局吴昭祥等四个同志的来信中提到：这个局为了完成工业“抗旱”任务，在打捞沉船的时候，把可以整体打捞起来的轮船“犬岛丸”拆散打捞了。结果使这只稍加修整即可使用的大轮船变成了一堆碎铁。辽宁省辽阳县煤建商店柳惠阁同志来信说：在工业“抗旱”运动中辽阳县有些居民和干部，把许多公共建筑物上的钢筋、下水道的铁管子和马路两边脏水井的铁篦子拆下来，当做废铁上缴。还有人把工厂院内存放待用的钢管、大锅等有用的器材也当成废钢铁拿走了。
    从这些来信中可以看出，有的同志对工业“抗旱”运动的意义认识还不够清楚。这个运动主要是要发挥群众的力量，做到人人动脑动手，从各方面、各个角落把一切无用的钢铁等金属材料和闲置的机器设备等，全部彻底地挖掘出来，用于工业生产。把一切死东西变成活东西，把一切废物变成有用之物，支援生产建设。现在，有的地方却把完整的船只和设备器材拆成废铁拿去“抗旱”，这岂不是把活东西变成死东西了吗？据读者来信反映，建造像“犬岛丸”这样大的轮船要一百多万元，把它拆散后打捞上来的钢铁却连十万元也不值。这岂不是得不偿失吗？
    我们希望各地有关部门注意这一问题。
