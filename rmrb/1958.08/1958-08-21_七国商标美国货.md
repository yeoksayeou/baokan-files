These days, the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session is engaged in an intense struggle surrounding the Middle East situation. On the one hand, socialist countries and independent Asian and African countries that love peace and freedom are resolutely striving for peace and to safeguard the right of national independence of all countries. On the other hand, the US-British aggressors are orchestrating a political conspiracy to legitimize their acts of aggression using the banner of the United Nations, and to facilitate the expansion of aggression in the future. The situation at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session illustrates that peace-loving people all over the world must resolutely continue the struggle against the US-British aggressors until they are forced to withdraw their troops from the Middle East and eliminate the tense situation in the Middle East.

Since the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session began, representatives from the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, Czechoslovakia, Saudi Arabia, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Iraq, Albania, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Poland, Burma, Ukraine, and other countries have pointed out in their speeches that the most urgent and important issue in the Middle East is the immediate withdrawal of US-British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Even the representative of Greece, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, hoped that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly would stipulate that all foreign troops should withdraw from the territories of Near and Middle Eastern countries as soon as possible. The position of these national representatives is entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of all peace-loving people in the world. Because everyone knows that the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and their continued presence in these two countries not only brutally violate the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, but also seriously threaten the security of Middle Eastern countries and world peace. As long as US-British troops do not withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, the security of all Middle Eastern countries cannot be guaranteed, and peace in the Middle East and the world will remain in danger. Indian representative Lall pointed out in his speech at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session: "The presence of foreign troops in the Near and Middle East creates the danger that any small incident could develop into a large-scale destructive war." Under the current circumstances, the primary task of the United Nations Organization is undoubtedly to urge the immediate withdrawal of US-British aggressor troops from the Middle East.

However, US-British imperialism not only refuses to withdraw its aggressor troops from the Middle East, but also attempts to use the tense situation created by its aggression against the Middle East to carry out armed threats against other regions of the world. Just as the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session was discussing the Middle East situation, the US aggressors openly used the excuse of "helping any friendly country in the Indian Ocean that may be affected by the Middle East crisis" to send six warships and two thousand Marines to Singapore, creating new tensions in the Far East and Southeast Asia. Coordinating with this conspiratorial activity, US-British aggressors are doing their best at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session to resist the demand for the withdrawal of US-British troops from the Middle East, in order to "legitimize" their aggression against the Middle East and use this as a foothold for further expansion of aggression. The proposal put forward by Norway and other seven countries to the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session on the 18th serves this conspiracy of the US-British aggressors.

The seven-nation proposal is actually a replica of the six-point plan put forward by Eisenhower at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session on August 13. Apart from saying that it "takes note of the statements made to the President of the United Nations General Assembly by the United Kingdom and the United States on August 18 regarding their troops in Lebanon and Jordan and their withdrawal," the proposal does not say a single word about the issue of US-British troop withdrawal. And the statement made by the US and Britain to the President of the General Assembly, Munro, on August 18 was no different from Eisenhower's attitude towards the withdrawal issue in his speech on the 13th. In this statement, the US-British aggressors continued to repeat those long-bankrupt lies, saying that the US-British occupation of Lebanon and Jordan was to "assist in maintaining" the "territorial integrity and political independence" of these two countries and "resist external dangers," and that their troops would only withdraw "if the duly constituted" governments of Lebanon and Jordan requested it, or "if the United Nations takes further action or takes other measures." The seven-nation proposal did not condemn the US-British acts of aggression, but instead asked the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session to "note" the US-British statements defending their acts of aggression, which is tantamount to asking the United Nations Organization to recognize the actions of the aggressors as justified and legal. Isn't this singing the same tune as the aggressors? As for the withdrawal "conditions" put forward in the US-British statement, they are nothing more than shields for the aggressors to refuse to withdraw their troops. Aren't the representatives of the traitorous governments of Lebanon and Jordan expressing gratitude for the US-British aggression against their countries at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session? Can't traitors like Chamoun and Hussein only rely on the bayonets and tanks of the US-British troops to survive? The withdrawal "conditions" put forward in the US-British statement are actually an excuse for the long-term occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. The seven-nation proposal does not mention the demand for US-British troop withdrawal, nakedly demonstrating that the proposal itself is a shield for the aggressors to refuse to withdraw their troops. Not only that, the seven-nation proposal also sang the tune that there should be no "indirect" infringement on other countries and "initiation of internal strife," following Eisenhower's baton. Eisenhower's nonsense about "indirect aggression" and "inciting internal strife from the outside" is considered by even some US-British bourgeois newspapers to be a fundamentally untenable excuse for aggression by US-British imperialism, but the seven-nation proposal repeats this tune, proving that they are standing with the aggressors, deliberately slandering and attacking Arab nationalism and the United Arab Republic. In addition, the seven-nation proposal also asks the United Nations Secretary-General to study the establishment of a "United Nations Peace Force" and to formulate an "Arab Development System" to promote the "economic development" of Arab countries. People heard these two proposals in Eisenhower's speech on the 13th. Arab and Asian-African public opinion has long pointed out that Eisenhower's two proposals are US imperialism's plan to continue its aggression against the Middle East. The seven-nation proposal is clearly attempting to pave the way for the realization of Eisenhower's aggressive plan here.

Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Engen said in his speech on the 19th that the seven-nation proposal attempts to establish "a middle ground," which "is a position of mutual accommodation," "a position of reconciliation and mutual sacrifice." What a "peacemaker" face! We want to ask: Since it is necessary to "accommodate each other" and "reconcile," then why doesn't the seven-nation proposal ask the aggressors to "accommodate" the wishes of the people of the Middle East and the people of the world, and withdraw their troops from the Middle East? Why not ask the aggressors to make a little gesture of reconciliation and restrain their plans to invade the Middle East? The seven-nation proposal did not make these demands, but instead allowed the aggressor troops to continue to stay in the Middle East, threatening the security of Arab countries and world peace, and allowing the aggressors to continue to promote their aggressive plans to suppress the national independence movements of the Arab people and other countries. Therefore, there is no "mutual accommodation" and "mutual sacrifice" here, only requiring the anti-aggression people to accommodate the aggressors, and requiring the people who safeguard peace and the right to national independence to make sacrifices for the interests of the aggressors. Obviously, this is not a "middle ground," but a position of condoning the aggressors! This position will not only not bring peace to the Middle East, but will also encourage the aggressors to expand their aggression more unscrupulously in the future. All truly peace-loving and freedom-loving people and countries will never adopt and resolutely oppose this position.

The seven-nation proposal asks the United Nations Secretary-General to study the establishment of "a United Nations Peace Force that can be deployed at any time," which is also a US conspiracy. Eisenhower had already put forward this proposal, and its purpose is to attempt to use this "force" as a tool for US-British imperialism to suppress the national independence movements of all countries. US Secretary of State Dulles said without concealment in his speech to the American Veterans Association on the 18th that the US goal is to have the so-called "task of dealing with indirect aggression" as much as possible "borne by the United Nations itself." And people know that the "indirect aggression" referred to by the US aggressors is the struggle of the people of all countries for national independence and democracy. Eisenhower and Dulles have always called the Iraqi people's revolution and the Lebanese people's struggle against the Chamoun group, as well as the Jordanian people's struggle against Hussein, "indirect aggression." Therefore, the task of this "United Nations Peace Force that can be deployed" needed by US imperialism is to arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign countries and brutally suppress the national liberation movements of all countries. This practice violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Charter stipulates that the United Nations Organization cannot interfere in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any country. The peace-loving people of all countries will never allow the United Nations Organization to become a colonial tool of the US-British aggressors.

It is very clear that the seven-nation proposal is a proposal that opposes the desire of peace-loving people around the world to stop aggression and maintain peace. The US-British aggressors instructed some North Atlantic countries and some countries they can control to put forward this proposal, obviously attempting to use the identity of these countries that did not directly participate in the aggression in order to raise the banner of a "middle road" to confuse the people of all countries. However, as long as you slightly compare this proposal with Eisenhower's speech, it is not difficult to see its essence of completely following the will of the US-British aggressors. Especially when US aggression has openly used the tense situation in the Middle East to expand its armed threats to Southeast Asia, the people of all countries can no longer tolerate any plan that allows the aggressor troops to continue to stay in the Middle East. The troops of the US-British aggressors must immediately withdraw from the Middle East. This is the primary and prerequisite condition for eliminating the tense situation in the Middle East, and it is also the most urgent demand of the people of the world and truly peace-loving countries. There is no room for any compromise or concession on this issue.

The UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session is still continuing. The conspiracies of US-British imperialism and their followers to use the United Nations to cover up their crimes and continue their aggression have aroused the vigilance and attention of the people and public opinion of all countries. The people of all countries unanimously condemn this despicable conspiracy of the US-British aggressors and their followers, and will continue to carry out unremitting struggles to promote the withdrawal of the troops of the US-British aggressors from the Middle East!

　　七国商标美国货
    这几天，联合国大会紧急特别会议正围绕着中东局势问题进行着紧张的斗争。一方面，社会主义国家和爱好和平与自由的亚非独立国家，坚决为争取和平和维护各国民族独立的权利而努力；另一方面，美英侵略者则正在导演一幕利用联合国的旗子，来使它们的侵略罪行合法化，并便于今后扩大侵略的政治阴谋。联大紧急特别会议的这种情况说明，全世界爱好和平的人民还必须把反对美英侵略者的斗争坚决进行下去，直到迫使侵略者把它们的军队撤出中东，消除中东的紧张局势为止。
    自从联大紧急特别会议举行以来，苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、沙特阿拉伯、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、印度、伊拉克、阿尔巴尼亚、印度尼西亚、阿富汗、波兰、缅甸、乌克兰等国的代表都在发言中指出，当前中东最迫切、最重要的问题是使美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。甚至，北大西洋集团成员国家希腊的代表，也希望联大采取的决议将规定一切外国军队尽速撤离中近东国家的领土。这些国家代表的这种主张，是完全符合世界上一切爱好和平人民的利益和愿望的。因为谁都知道，美英军队对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略和继续留驻在这两个国家，不但是粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章的基本原则，并且严重地威胁着中东国家的安全和世界和平。美英军队一天不撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，所有中东国家的安全就不能得到保证，中东和世界的和平就会继续处在危险之中。印度代表拉尔在联大紧急特别会议上的发言中指出：“外国军队留在中近东会造成这样一种危险，即任何一点点意外事件都可能发展成为大规模毁灭性的战争。”在当前的这种情况下，联合国组织的首要任务毫无疑问是应当促使美英侵略军队立即撤出中东。
    但是，美英帝国主义不但不肯从中东撤退它们的侵略军队，而且还力图利用它们侵略中东所造成的紧张局势，对世界其他地区进行武装威胁。就在联大紧急特别会议讨论中东局势问题的时候，美国侵略者就公然以“帮助印度洋中可能受到中东危机影响的任何友好国家”为借口，把六艘军舰和两千名海军陆战队开入新加坡，在远东和东南亚制造新的紧张局势。与这种阴谋活动相配合，美英侵略者在联大紧急特别会议上正竭力抗拒美英军队撤出中东的要求，以便使它们侵略中东的行为“合法化”，并以此作为进一步扩大侵略的立足点。18日由挪威等七国向联大紧急特别会议提出的提案，就是为美英侵略者的这一阴谋服务的。
    七国提案，实际上是艾森豪威尔于8月13日在联大紧急特别会议上提出的六点计划的翻版。这个提案除了说“注意到美英在8月18日就它们在黎巴嫩和约旦的军队和它们的撤退问题”向联合国大会主席所作的声明之外，对美英撤军问题没有再讲一个字。而美英8月18日给联大主席孟罗所作的声明，同艾森豪威尔在13日演说中对撤军问题所表示的态度丝毫没有两样。美英侵略者在这个声明中继续重谈那些早已破了产的谎言，说什么美英军队对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵占是“协助维护”这两个国家的“领土完整和政治独立、抵御外来的危险”，并且说“只要正当组成的”黎巴嫩和约旦政府提出要求，或者“联合国采取进一步行动或者采取其他方法”，它们的军队才肯撤出。七国提案没有谴责美英的侵略行动，相反地却要求联大紧急特别会议“注意”美英为它们的侵略行为辩护的声明，这无异是要联合国组织承认侵略者的行动是正当的和合法的。这不是同侵略者一个鼻孔出气，又是什么呢？至于美英声明中所提出的那些撤军“条件”，则不过是侵略者拒绝撤军的盾牌。黎巴嫩和约旦卖国政府的代表在联大紧急特别会议上，不是对美英对他们国家的侵略表示感恩戴德吗？夏蒙和侯赛因这类卖国贼不是只能依靠美英军队的刺刀和坦克生活吗？美英声明中所提出的撤军“条件”，实际上是长期侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的借口。七国提案只字不提要求美英撤军，赤裸裸地表明了这个提案的本身就是侵略者拒绝撤军的盾牌。不只如此，七国提案还随着艾森豪威尔的指挥棒，唱出了什么不得“间接”侵害别国和“发动内争”的调子。艾森豪威尔的“间接侵略”和“从外部发动内争”的胡说，甚至一些美英资产阶级报纸也认为是美英帝国主义的根本站不住脚的侵略借口，而七国提案却重唱了这种调子，这证明它们是跟侵略者站在一道，蓄意地对阿拉伯民族主义和阿拉伯联合共和国进行诬蔑和攻击。此外，七国提案还要求联合国秘书长研究建立一支“联合国和平部队”和制定一项“阿拉伯发展制度”来促进阿拉伯国家的“经济发展”。而这两项主张，人们早在艾森豪威尔13日的演说中听到过了。阿拉伯和亚非国家的舆论早已指出，艾森豪威尔的这两项主张是美帝国主义继续侵略中东的计划。七国提案在这里显然是企图为实现艾森豪威尔的侵略计划开辟道路。
    挪威外交副大臣恩根在19日的发言中说，七国提案企图建立“一个中间的立场”，这种立场“是互相迁就的立场”，“是和解和互相牺牲的立场”。好一个“和事佬”的面目！我们要问：既然是要“互相迁就”和“和解”，那么，在七国提案中为什么不要求侵略者稍为“迁就”一下中东人民和全世界人民的愿望，从中东撤退它们的军队呢？为什么不要求侵略者作一点和解的表示，收敛起它们侵略中东的计划呢？七国提案没有提出这些要求，而是让侵略者的军队继续留在中东威胁阿拉伯国家的安全和世界和平，让侵略者继续推行它们的侵略计划，来镇压阿拉伯人民和其他各国人民的民族独立运动。因而，这里并没有什么“互相迁就”和“互相牺牲”，有的只是要反侵略的人民向侵略者迁就，要维护和平和民族独立权的人民为侵略者的利益作出牺牲。显然，这不是什么“中间的立场”，而是纵容侵略者的立场！这种立场，不但不会给中东带来和平，反而会助长侵略者今后更加肆无忌惮地扩大侵略。一切真正爱好和平和自由的人民和国家，都决不会采取而且坚决反对这种立场的。
    七国提案要求联合国秘书长研究建立“一支随时可以调用的联合国和平部队”的问题，这也是美国的阴谋，艾森豪威尔早就提出过这个主张，其目的是企图利用这一支“部队”来充当美英帝国主义镇压各国人民民族独立运动的工具。美国国务卿杜勒斯于18日在美国国外退伍军人协会上发表的演说中，就毫不隐讳地说，美国的目的是要把所谓“对付间接侵略的任务”尽可能地“由联合国自己来负担”。而人们知道，美国侵略者所说的“间接侵略”，就是各国人民争取民族独立和民主的斗争。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯就一直把伊拉克人民的革命和黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙集团的斗争，以及约旦人民反对侯赛因的斗争，叫做“间接侵略”。因此，美国帝国主义所需要的这支“可以调用的联合国和平部队”的任务，就是任意干涉主权国家的内政，横暴地镇压各国人民的民族解放运动。这种做法是违反联合国宪章的原则的。联合国宪章规定，联合国组织不能干涉本质上属于任何国家国内管辖的事项。各国爱好和平的人民也决不允许联合国组织成为美英侵略者的殖民工具。
    事情很清楚，七国提案是一个与全世界爱好和平人民的制止侵略、维护和平的愿望相对抗的提案。美英侵略者指使一些北大西洋国家和它们所能控制的一些国家提出这个提案，显然是企图利用这些国家没有直接参加侵略行动的身份，以便打起“中间的道路”的招牌，来迷惑各国人民。但是，只要稍为把这个提案同艾森豪威尔的演说对照一下，人们就不难看出它的完全遵从美英侵略者的意旨的实质。特别是在美国侵略已公然利用中东紧张局势把武装威胁的行动扩大到东南亚的情况下，各国人民更不能容忍侵略者的军队能够继续留在中东的任何方案。美英侵略者的军队必须立即撤出中东，这是消除中东紧张局势的首要的先决的条件，也是全世界人民和真正爱好和平的国家的最迫切的要求。在这个问题上是没有任何妥协和折衷的余地的。
    联大紧急特别会议还在继续举行。美英帝国主义和它们的追随者企图利用联合国来掩盖罪行和继续侵略的阴谋，已引起了各国人民和舆论的警惕和注意。各国人民一致谴责美英侵略者及其追随者的这种卑劣阴谋，并将继续为促使美英侵略者的军队撤出中东而进行坚持不懈的斗争！
