Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 17th—Antoine Tabit, Chairman of the Lebanese Peace Committee, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: The immediate withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan is "a necessary condition for the Lebanese people to stop armed struggle and for peace and security to be restored in the Middle East."

The leader of the Lebanese peace movement said that striving for the immediate withdrawal of the American invading army is the most urgent task of the Lebanese people.

Commenting on the symbolic withdrawal of a battalion of American troops, he said that this embarrassing practice was to prevent the United States from becoming a defendant in the United Nations General Assembly and cannot deceive anyone. He added, "In fact, people know that the Marine Corps withdrawn was initially scheduled to be replaced by the army transferred from Turkey, West Germany, or elsewhere."

He said that the United States fabricated rumors that the United Arab Republic was carrying out "indirect aggression" against Lebanon, which has been refuted by the facts and the reports of the United Nations observers who came to Lebanon. He pointed out that under the guise of this statement, the United States aimed to find an excuse to expand its aggression against Syria and Iraq. He said that the Americans themselves had confirmed that their troops were ready to intervene in Iraq, attempting to save the Baghdad Pact, which had suffered a fatal blow due to the Iraqi revolution.

He said: "Therefore, people can see that the real aggressor against Lebanon is the American army, which landed on Lebanese territory regardless of the wishes of the Lebanese people and in violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter." He pointed out that Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that countries have the right to collective self-defense, does not apply to the Lebanese issue, because this issue has been discussed in the Security Council and some measures have also been taken.

Referring to Murphy's activities in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries, Tabit said that this American envoy seemed to be "a high commissioner, who shows how much the American rulers despise the sovereignty and independence of Middle Eastern countries."

The Chairman of the Peace Committee refuted the American claim that the United States is the protector of the interests of small countries, saying: Just recalling its interference in the Philippines, Panama, Guatemala, Korea, Vietnam, and recently Indonesia is enough to understand its true intentions towards small countries.

He said: "American imperialists treat these countries as raw material supply bases or sales markets for inferior commodities. They attempt to make small countries dependent on them in order to exploit them to fatten American big trusts. This is the only interest that American imperialists have in small countries. However, in addition to this, we can also add one point: they covet military bases and strategic strongholds around the world."

Tabit said that the Lebanese people, like the people of other West Asian and African countries, have always warmly welcomed and strongly supported the principles of the Bandung Conference and the principles of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo in early 1958. He said that implementing the principles and resolutions of these two historic conferences would make it possible to establish a peaceful region in the Near and Middle East.

Finally, he thanked the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all socialist and peace-loving countries for the moral support they have given to the Lebanese people in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace. He said: "For the greatest benefit of peace and international cooperation, the lasting friendship that unites our people in the most difficult moments will be strengthened day by day."

Commenting on the communiqué of the talks between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong, the leader of the Lebanese peace movement said, "By issuing a warning to American and British interventionists, and by forcing them to consider carefully before launching new aggression, this communiqué has made a great contribution to the cause of peace in the Middle East and the world."

    美国对小国的唯一兴趣就是掠夺
　  侵略者的花招决骗不过中东人民
　　黎巴嫩和平委员会主席塔伯特对新华社记者发表谈话
    新华社贝鲁特17日电　黎巴嫩和平委员会主席安托万·塔伯特向新华社记者说：美国和英国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦是“黎巴嫩人民停止武装斗争和中东恢复和平和安全的必要条件”。
    这位黎巴嫩和平运动领袖说，争取美国侵略军立即撤出是黎巴嫩人民的最紧急任务。
    他评论一营美国军队的象征性撤出说，这种尴尬的做法是为了使美国在联合国大会不致成为被告，这是骗不了什么人的。他又说，“事实上人们知道，撤出的这批海军陆战队一开始就预定要由从土耳其、西德或别的地方调来的陆军代替的。”
    他说，美国造谣说阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩进行“间接侵略”，这种说法已被事实和前来黎巴嫩的联合国观察团的报告所驳斥。他指出，在这种说法的幌子下，美国的目的在于寻找借口以便扩大对叙利亚、伊拉克的侵略。他说，美国人自己也证实，他们的军队曾经准备好要干涉伊拉克，企图挽救由于伊拉克革命而遭到致命打击的巴格达条约。
    他说：“因此人们可以看到，对黎巴嫩的真正侵略者是美国军队，他们不顾黎巴嫩人民的意愿和违反联合国宪章原则而在黎巴嫩的领土登陆。”他指出，联合国宪章中规定各国有权集体自卫的第五十一条并不适用于黎巴嫩问题，因为这个问题已在安全理事会中讨论过，而且还采取了一些措施。
    塔伯特谈到墨菲在黎巴嫩和其它中东国家活动时说，这个美国使者好像是“一个高级专员，他表明美国统治者多么看不起中东国家的主权和独立”。
    这位和平委员会主席驳斥了美国关于美国是小国利益的保护者的说法，他说：只要回忆一下它对菲律宾、巴拿马、危地马拉、朝鲜、越南以及最近对印度尼西亚的干涉，就足以了解它对小国的真正意图了。
    他说：“美帝国主义者把这些国家当作原料供应地或者次等商品的销售市场，他们企图使小国依赖他们，以便对它们进行剥削来养肥美国的大托辣斯。这就是美帝国主义者对小国的唯一兴趣。不过，除此以外，我们还可以加上一点：他们贪图在全世界获取军事基地和战略据点。”
    塔伯特说，黎巴嫩人民同其它西亚和非洲国家人民一样，一直很热烈地欢迎和大力地支持万隆会议原则和1958年初在开罗召开的亚非人民团结大会的原则。他说，履行这两次具有历史意义的会议的原则和决议就有可能在中近东建立一个和平地区。
    最后他感谢中国、苏联以及所有社会主义和爱好和平的国家的人民在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中给予黎巴嫩人民的道义的支持。他说：“为了和平和国际合作的最大利益，在最困难的时刻把我们的人民联结起来的持久友谊将日益加强。”
    在评论赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东的会谈公报时，这位黎巴嫩和平运动领袖说，“由于对美国和英国干涉者发出了警告，由于使他们在发动新的侵略以前不得不慎重考虑，这个公报已经对中东和世界的和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。”
