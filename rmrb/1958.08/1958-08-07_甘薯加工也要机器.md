    Sweet Potato Processing Also Needs Machines
    Digging sweet potatoes out of the ground is only part of the harvesting task; the more important task is storage. With such a large area (every county, township, and commune in the country has them) and such high yields this year, it is necessary to change the past storage methods of mainly fresh storage and supplemented by dry storage. This requires the mass production of new sweet potato slicing and shredding machines, and the improvement of these older machines. For dry storage, it is also necessary to manufacture drying machines and invent drying kiln methods. It is hoped that relevant departments can manufacture these machines in a timely manner and promote their widespread use, which will not only improve labor efficiency but also shorten the time for digging, slicing, shredding, and drying, thus creating favorable conditions for the proper preservation of sweet potatoes.

    甘薯加工也要机器
    从地里将地瓜（甘薯）刨出来，只不过完成收获任务的一部分，更重要的是储藏任务。像今年这样大面积（全国各县、乡、社都有）而又高额丰产，必须改变过去以鲜储为主，干储为辅的储藏方法。这就必须大量制造新的地瓜切片、切丝机，并改良这类旧的机器。为了干储还必须制造烘干机和创造发明烘干窑等方法。希望有关部门能把这些机器适时地制造出来，并能普遍推广使用，不仅能提高劳动效率，更能缩短挖掘、切片、丝和烘干时间，这样就给妥善保存地瓜创造了有利条件。  迎舟
