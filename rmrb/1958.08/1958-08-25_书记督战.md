　　Secretary Supervises Battle
    The construction and production of the iron and steel industry is the most important issue in China's current industrial construction. Its speed of development will affect or determine the speed of development of other industries. Now, some new problems have emerged on this front, such as insufficient equipment supply or insufficient technical strength, which require Party committees at all levels to come up with solutions. In particular, it is very necessary for Party committee secretaries at all levels to personally take charge, go to the front line to supervise the battle, and dissect a few "sparrows" to understand the situation and decide on countermeasures.
    According to past experience, no matter what the matter is, as long as politics takes the lead and the secretary takes the lead, it will definitely be easy to handle, and the situation will change. Now, news has come that many provincial Party committee secretaries and local Party committee secretaries at all levels have personally gone to the iron and steel front line to supervise the battle. We believe that with the secretary taking the lead and the hard work of the broad masses day and night, the construction and production of the iron and steel industry will inevitably usher in a new high tide of even greater magnificence.

　　书记督战
    钢铁工业的建设和生产是当前我国工业建设中头等重要的问题，它发展的快慢，将影响着或决定着其它工业发展的速度。现在，在这一条战线上出现了一些新问题，或者是设备供应不上，或者是技术力量不足，等等，很需要各级党委拿出办法来。特别是很需要各级党委书记亲自动手抓一抓，亲临前线督战，解剖几只“麻雀”看一看，以便了解情况，决定对策。
    根据过去的经验，不论什么事情，只要政治挂帅，书记挂帅，就一定好办，面貌就会改观。现在，消息传来，许多省委书记和各级地方党委书记已亲临钢铁前线督战。我们相信，随着书记挂帅和广大群众的日夜苦战，钢铁工业的建设和生产，必然会出现一个波澜更加壮阔的新高潮。
