Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 14th - By the end of July, over 10,000 factories and mines had been built in the minority areas of Yunnan's border region, which stretches for 4,000 miles along the national border. On average, more than 40 factories and mines were completed and put into production every day. From the Bilo Snow Mountain to the Ailao Mountains, the industries run by rural villages and communes are scattered like stars. Even the Kawa people, who not long ago still preserved relatively complete remnants of primitive clan communes, have established 15 small factories and mines producing farm tools, pottery, and clothing.

With the development of industry, the face of the minority nationalities has changed. Nationalities that originally practiced "slash-and-burn" agriculture are now able to make ploughshares themselves for the first time. The wooden bowls and bamboo tubes used by some nationalities for generations will soon be replaced by pottery utensils. The Jingpo, Lisu, and other ethnic groups, whose agricultural implements were mainly bamboo and wood, ended the history of no industry in their own ethnic groups within a short period of several months. Even in the Dai areas, where handicrafts had not yet been separated from agriculture, newly built factories have trial-produced many new products such as tractors. In April this year, the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture established the prefecture's first tractor station with its own finished products.

The industrial construction in the minority areas of Yunnan's border region is developing at a faster pace than in the interior. This year, the output value of local industries in Yunnan Province is expected to increase by 150% to 200% compared with last year, while the industrial output value of ethnic autonomous prefectures such as Honghe and Dehong has increased by 400% to 600% compared with last year. By the end of July, the autonomous prefectures of Honghe, Wenshan, and Dehong had completed 110% to 157% of their annual output value.

With the development of industry, the number of minority workers has grown from zero to tens of thousands. Recently, more than 70 advanced producers from 18 ethnic groups, including the Dai, Hani, and Kawa, were selected to attend the provincial conference of representatives of advanced producers in the industrial and transportation systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 14th - In the vigorous development of local industry, the Qiannan Buyi-Miao Autonomous Prefecture has received fraternal care and support from industrial cities across the country.

By the end of July, large factories under construction in the autonomous prefecture, such as iron and steel and machinery factories, had received a total of 80 high-precision machine tools and engines from cities such as Shenyang, Beijing, Jinan, Changchun, Changsha, and Kunming. The Xi'an Construction and Installation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Wuhan Electric Power Design Institute have helped design and construct some of the factories here. Anhui, Guangdong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and 15 other provinces and cities have not only actively trained more than 560 workers with various technical skills and 65 factory management cadres for the autonomous prefecture, but also sent more than 100 engineering and technical cadres and skilled workers to provide support.

In order to help the fraternal ethnic groups in southern Guizhou develop industry, factories and government departments in various industrial cities have tried every means to tap their potential to meet the requirements of the autonomous prefecture as much as possible. The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant gave up 15 of its own transformers and motors, as well as 45 tons of high-quality steel. The Shanghai Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company had a relatively heavy production task this year and no longer accepted orders, but after receiving a letter from the Qiannan Flax Textile Factory requesting support for machinery, it managed to include it in the production plan and has now delivered some of the machinery.

Factories and mines in various places have given meticulous care and assistance in learning and life to the workers and cadres of all ethnic groups sent by the Qiannan Autonomous Prefecture to study.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 14th - The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established 31 machinery manufacturing plants and metal processing plants, and has developed more than 400 iron production cooperatives. Now, all major towns in the region have machinery industry, and a region-wide machinery manufacturing and repair network has been initially formed. The level of mechanization in these factories is constantly improving, with more than 2,000 metal cutting machine tools and forging equipment, 27 times more than five years ago.

Now, the autonomous region is not only able to manufacture 1,500-kilowatt generators, universal automobiles, and universal tractors, but also to manufacture complete sets of equipment for steel plants with an annual output of less than 10 tons. The Hohhot Xinsheng Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which started as a small iron factory, has recently manufactured and is rushing to manufacture 100 sets of small blast furnace equipment, and is producing batches of steam boilers, boiler-towing machines, gas engines, water turbines, and various power generation, electric, and general mechanical products. Machinery factories in Baotou, Hohhot, and other places have also begun to manufacture complete sets of steelmaking, ironmaking, and steel rolling equipment. After the machinery factories and iron factories in Chifeng, Hailar, and other places successfully trial-produced gantry planers and six-foot lathes, they have recently been officially put into production one after another. In addition, the agricultural and animal husbandry machinery factories, farm implement factories, and iron factories distributed throughout the autonomous region have manufactured more than 54,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, more than 300 five-horsepower boiler-towing machines, and more than 2,000 horse-drawn mowing machines, which have initially met the needs of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups to develop production. At present, factories are manufacturing a large number of tools such as ball bearings, feed grinders, steel sheet grinders, and milking machines to further promote the technological revolution in rural and pastoral areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou - The people of all ethnic groups in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province are developing local industries with a revolutionary spirit that equals twenty years in one day. In less than two months, a new situation has emerged throughout the autonomous prefecture, with local industries blooming everywhere. More than 100,000 industrial units have been built, including more than 40 kinds of mines such as iron, steel, antimony, aluminum, gold, and coal, and machinery manufacturing plants, automobile repair plants, glass manufacturing plants, leather factories, and chemical plants. More than 81,000 industrial units have been put into production, with 280 kinds of products and an output value of more than 2.778 million yuan. Now, harvesters, double-share plows, and blowers have begun to be produced, and steel and petroleum are also being smelted.

The Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in southern Gansu, and administers two agricultural counties, Zhouqu and Lintan, two pastoral counties, Maqu and Luqu, and two semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral counties, Xiahe and Zhuoni. It has a population of 330,000 people of Tibetan, Hui, Han, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups, of which Tibetans account for 60%. At present, three of the six counties in the autonomous prefecture, Zhouqu, Lintan, and Zhuoni, each have 20,000 industrial units.

　　少数民族地区盛开工业之花
　　云南机器轰鸣黔南得到各地支援
　　内蒙古撒下机械网甘南建厂十万
    新华社昆明14日电　四千里国境线上的云南边疆少数民族地区，到7月底止，已建起一万多个厂矿，平均每天有四十多个厂矿建成和投入生产。从碧罗雪山到哀牢山脉，乡社办的工业更是星罗棋布。不久以前还比较完整地保存着原始氏族公社残余的佧佤族，也办起农具、陶器、缝纫等十五个小厂矿。
    随着工业的发展，少数民族的面貌变了样。原来“刀耕火种”的民族，也能破天荒自制犁铧了。有些民族世代使用的木钵和竹筒，很快将被陶制器皿所代替。以竹木农具为主的景颇族、傈僳族等，在短短的几个月内，结束了本民族没有工业的历史。连手工业还未从农业中分离出来的傣族地区，新建工厂已试制出拖拉机等许多新产品。德宏傣族景颇族自治州今年4月就以自己的成品，建立了自治州第一个拖拉机站。
    云南边疆少数民族地区的工业建设，以比内地更快的速度发展着。今年，云南省地方工业产值比去年预计增长一倍半到两倍，而红河、德宏等民族自治州的工业产值都比去年猛增四倍到六倍。到7月底，红河、文山、德宏等自治州已完成年产值的110％到157％。
    随着工业的发展，少数民族工人从无到有地发展到数万人。最近，各地还选出傣、哈尼、佧佤等十八种民族的七十多名先进生产者，出席全省工业交通系统先进生产者代表会议。
    据新华社贵阳14日电　黔南布依族苗族自治州在大力发展地方工业中，得到全国各工业城市兄弟般的关怀和支援。
    自治州正在兴建的钢铁、机械等大工厂，到7月底止，得到沈阳、北京、济南、长春、长沙和昆明等城市支援的各种精密度很高的机床、发动机等，共达八十台。水利部西安建筑安装工程局、武汉电力设计院等单位，都帮助这里一部分工厂进行了设计和施工。安徽、广东和上海、广州等十五个省市，不仅积极为自治州培训五百六十多名掌握各种技术的工人和六十五名工厂管理干部，并派了一百多名工程技术干部和技术工人前来支援。
    为了帮助黔南兄弟民族发展工业，各工业城市的工厂和机关都想办法、挖潜力，尽量满足这个自治州的要求。沈阳机床二厂把自己用的变压器、电动机等十五台以及四十五吨优质钢，也让了出来。上海纺织机制造公司今年的生产任务比较重，不再接受订货了，但是接到黔南麻纺厂要求支援机器的来信后，又设法列入了生产计划，目前已交付一部分机器。
    各地厂矿对黔南自治州派去学习的各族工人和干部，在学习上和生活上给予了无微不至的关怀和帮助。
    据新华社呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古自治区已经建立起三十一座机械制造厂和金属加工厂，并发展了四百多个铁业生产合作社。现在，区内各主要城镇都有了机械工业，初步形成了全区机械制造、修配网。这些工厂的机械化水平正在不断提高，已拥有金属切削机床、锻压设备二千多台，比五年前增加了二十七倍。
    现在，自治区不仅能够制造一千五百瓩的发电机、万能汽车和万能拖拉机，而且能够制造年产十吨以下钢铁厂的全套设备。由小型铁工厂起家的呼和浩特新生机械制造厂，最近就已制成和正在赶制一百套小高炉设备，并生产成批的蒸汽锅炉、锅驼机、煤气机、水轮机和各种发电、电动、通用机械产品。包头、呼和浩特等地机械厂，也开始制造整套炼钢、炼铁和轧钢设备。赤峰、海拉尔等地机械厂、铁工厂试制成功龙门刨床、六呎车床后，最近也已陆续正式投入生产。此外，分布在自治区各地的农牧业机械厂、农具厂和铁工厂，制造出的五万四千多台双轮双铧犁、三百多台五马力锅驼机、二千多台马拉割搂草机，初步满足了各族农牧民发展生产的要求。现在，各工厂正在制造大量滚珠轴承、饲料粉碎机、钢片磨、挤奶器等工具，进一步促进农村、牧区的技术革命。
    新华社兰州电　甘肃省甘南藏族自治州的各族人民，以一天等于二十年的革命干劲大办地方工业。还不到两个月的时间，全自治州出现了万紫千红朵朵开、地方工业遍山川的新局面，已建起铁、钢、锑、铝、金、煤等四十多种矿场，和机械制造厂、汽车修配厂、玻璃制造厂、皮革厂、化工厂等十万多个工业单位。其中八万一千多个工业单位已投入生产，产品达二百八十种，产值为二百七十七万八千多元。现在，收割机、双铧犁、鼓风机等都开始生产了，钢、石油也正在冶炼。
    甘南藏族自治州位于甘肃南部，辖舟曲、临潭两个农业县，玛曲、碌曲两个牧业县和夏河、卓尼两个半农半牧县。有藏、回、汉、蒙古等族人口三十三万，其中藏族占60％。现在，全自治州六个县已有舟曲、临潭、卓尼等三个县，每县有两万个工业单位。
