(Reported by this newspaper) A new stage has been reached in the work-study movement. Establishing factories within schools can improve teaching, scientific research, and students' ideological understanding, promote educational reform, and also undertake part of the nation's industrial and agricultural production tasks.

Universities, colleges, secondary vocational schools, and even regular middle schools in various regions are establishing factories. Some have already built a batch and are continuing to build more, while others are actively preparing. According to extremely incomplete data collected by the end of July, over 3,720 factories have been built in 115 universities and colleges.

In various regions, schools have built factories by expanding their laboratories, but the vast majority have been built from scratch, starting small and growing larger. Most of the funding for building these factories comes from the schools themselves, generally through three methods: one is combining work-study programs with thrift in running the school, saving on school expenses; another is absorbing scattered funds, with teachers and students raising money to run the factories themselves; and the third is income from past work-study programs. These three methods are generally used simultaneously. Accumulating funds from work-study income is a creation of the masses, providing schools with an inexhaustible source of funds for running factories, combining work-study with thrifty production, and basically solving the distribution problem of work-study programs. Beijing Hydroelectric Power School, with 1,700 students, helped design and build 14 hydroelectric power stations in the suburbs of Beijing through work-study programs. The entire school, including other income, accumulated 130,000 yuan, which was invested in expanding and building affiliated factories. Some schools run their own factories, while others cooperate with brother schools or relevant departments outside the school to establish key factories in a planned way or to establish "satellite factories" for relevant industrial and mining enterprises outside the school. In this way, the factories run by schools form a situation of "large, medium, and small enterprises coexisting" both inside and outside the school, blooming everywhere in terms of scale and form. Inside the school, there are class factories, department factories, and school factories; from the perspective of external connections, there are key large-scale factories invested in by the state, medium-sized factories run in cooperation with schools and local enterprises, and small factories run by the schools themselves. This coexistence of various types of factories fully unleashes the potential of schools in running factories.

After schools run factories, new situations have emerged. It has standardized and institutionalized work-study programs, enabling the active arrangement of teaching and production labor plans. Teachers also have a fixed base for conducting research, allowing them to better carry out scientific research. Currently, schools in various regions stipulate labor methods and requirements for students during their studies based on different situations. Some require a certain amount of labor each day, while others require a fixed number of hours per week, month, semester, or year. The organic combination of production labor and classroom learning is beneficial to the healthy development of students' physical and mental well-being. Some students in Kaifeng City, Henan, said: "In the past, we learned science and chemistry but didn't apply it; now, when we experiment in factories, we not only understand but can also use it." Jiuquan Middle School in Gansu has built 21 small factories, and through production labor in teaching, has already made over 700 inventions and creations. In factories run by Tsinghua University and other schools, the teaching time for some courses has been shortened, but the quality can be higher than in the past. With the establishment of factories in schools, the development of the entire education cause has been promoted. In universities and colleges in Beijing, Xi'an, and many other places, some new majors are being added due to the equipment problems being solved by running factories.

After schools run factories, they have further strengthened their relationship with local areas, enabling education to serve industrial and agricultural production. The factories run by secondary and higher schools across the country produce a wide variety of products based on their own characteristics and conditions, according to the needs of local industrial and agricultural production and the situation of production, supply, and sales. According to a rough estimate of the factories built by just 40 universities and colleges, there are already over 1,800 new products, some of which have reached or exceeded international standards.

The potential of schools running factories is enormous, and local Party committees have strengthened their leadership in this work. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee was the first to include university and college factories in local industrial production plans, helping schools solve production, supply, and sales problems in a concrete way. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee regards school-run factories as a component of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, organizing schools to cooperate with relevant enterprises.

### 大中学校办工厂花开遍地  勤工俭学观潮派你来看  培养新人  建设祖国  为啥不好？

　　大中学校办工厂花开遍地
    勤工俭学观潮派你来看
    培养新人  建设祖国  为啥不好？
    本报讯  勤工俭学活动进入新阶段，在学校内部办工厂，提高教学、科学研究质量和学生思想认识，推动教学改革，又担负国家工农业生产中的一部分任务。
    各地大专学校、中等专业学校以至普通中学办工厂，有的已经建立了一批，还在继续兴建，有的正在积极筹建。到7月底根据极不完全的材料所调查的一百一十五所高等学校，已建厂三千七百二十多个。
    各地学校办工厂，有的把实验室加以扩建而成，绝大多数是从无到有、从小到大办起来的。建厂资金的来源，大部分是学校内部自己筹集，一般有三种办法，一种是勤工俭学和勤俭办学结合，节约学校经费开支；一种是吸收零散资金，由学校师生自己集资办厂；一种是过去勤工俭学的收入。三种办法一般是同时并举的。从勤工俭学收入积累资金，是群众的一项创造，为学校办工厂找到取之不尽的资金来源，使勤工俭学和勤俭生产相结合，并基本解决了勤工俭学的分配问题。北京水力发电学校一千七百人，在勤工俭学中帮助北京市郊区设计、建造十四个水电站，全校连同其它收入在内积累了十三万元，投资扩建并新建了附属工厂。有些学校自己办厂，有些学校同兄弟学校或校外有关部门协作，有计划地建立一些重点工厂，或为校外有关工矿企业建立“卫星厂”。这样，学校所办工厂从规模、形式等方面形成一个校内外“大中小并举”遍地开花的局面。在学校内部有班厂、系厂、校厂；从校外联系看，有由国家投资在校所办的重点大型厂，由学校和地方企业部门协作办的中型厂，学校自办的小厂。这种各式各样厂的并举，充分发挥了学校办厂的潜力。
    学校办工厂以后，出现了新的情况，它使勤工俭学定型化、制度化，能主动地安排教学和生产劳动计划；教师也有了进行研究的固定基地，更好地进行科学研究。现在各地学校根据不同情况规定学生在学习期间的劳动办法和要求，有的是每天做一定劳动，有的是一星期、一月、一学期、一年做固定时数。生产劳动和课堂学习有机地结合，对学生身心各方面健康地发展都有好处。河南开封市有的学生说：“从前学理化，学而不化；现在到工厂试验，不但能懂还能用。”甘肃酒泉中学办起二十一座小型工厂，在教学中生产劳动，已有七百多项创造发明。清华大学等校办工厂，有的课程教学时间缩短了，而质量可比过去提高。随着学校办工厂，推动整个教育事业的发展，在北京、西安以及其它许多地方的高等学校由于办工厂解决了设备问题，正在增设一些新的专业。
    学校办工厂后进一步加强了和地方的关系，使教育为工农业生产服务。全国中等以上学校所办工厂分别结合本身特点和条件，按照当地工农业生产需要和供产销的情况，生产出万紫千红的产品。仅据四十所高等学校所建工厂的粗略统计，已有一千八百多种新产品，一部分已达到或超过国际水平。
    学校办工厂的潜力是巨大的，各地党委已加强对这一工作的领导。安徽省委首先把高等学校工厂列入地方工业生产规划，帮助学校具体解决产供销问题。武汉市委把学校办工厂作为全党全民办工业的一个组成部分，组织学校与有关企业单位协作。（附图片）
