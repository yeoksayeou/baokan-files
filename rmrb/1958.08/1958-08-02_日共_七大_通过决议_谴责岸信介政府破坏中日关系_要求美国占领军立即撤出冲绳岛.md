Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st -- The Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party passed a resolution on promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

The resolution pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the urgent demands of the Japanese people, has consistently hindered the development of friendly Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, it has comprehensively undermined the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the Fisheries Agreement, and cultural exchange activities between the peoples of the two countries, destroying the friendly relations established through years of efforts by the peoples of China and Japan. The resolution stated that the Japanese people, who long for Sino-Japanese friendship, absolutely cannot forgive the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude in handling the Liu Lianren incident and the Nagasaki flag desecration incident.

The resolution condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for allowing the United States to establish military bases in Japan, transport nuclear weapons into Japan, nuclear arming the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces," and piecing together a Northeast Asian military alliance. The resolution said that all of these serve the U.S. atomic strategy system that is hostile to China.

The resolution emphasized that the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-China policy is to drive the Japanese people to serve the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

The resolution said that the Japanese working class and people of other strata have taken action to smash the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-China policy, restore normal Sino-Japanese relations, develop Sino-Japanese trade and cultural exchange, and open the path to peaceful coexistence. The resolution said that the Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the Japanese people to promote the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and Sino-Japanese friendship, so as to develop these movements into a movement of the entire people, to stop the Kishi Nobusuke government's nuclear armament policy and the conspiracy to piece together a Northeast Asian military alliance, and to strive for the abolition of the "Japan-Chiang Treaty" and the speedy restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st -- The Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party, at its plenary session held on July 30th, passed a resolution on the Okinawa issue. The resolution demanded that the United States immediately withdraw its troops and military bases from Okinawa and return Okinawa to Japan.

The resolution pointed out that the U.S. imperialists are strengthening their control over Okinawa militarily and politically and openly expressing their intention to permanently occupy Okinawa.

The resolution pointed out that Okinawa has now become a U.S. missile base, and U.S. aircraft carrying nuclear weapons taking off from Okinawa bases are flying over Japan. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government has not raised even half a word of protest.

The resolution emphasized that Okinawa is not only an aggressive base targeting China and the Soviet Union in the U.S. imperialists' atomic strategic system and a stronghold for suppressing the Japanese national liberation movement, but it is also increasingly playing its role as a stronghold for suppressing the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, and pro-independence struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa and for strengthening the control and exploitation of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

The resolution said that the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party expresses its deep respect to the 800,000 residents of Okinawa Prefecture and the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces who have always opposed turning Okinawa into a U.S. military base and demanded the return of Okinawa to Japan in order to strive for Japan's independence and peace and the liberation of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

The resolution said that the Japanese Communist Party will unite the strength of the people throughout Japan and fight to the end to achieve the following goals: demand that the United States immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan; oppose turning Okinawa into a missile base, abolish all U.S. military bases; immediately withdraw U.S. troops from Okinawa; fully implement the Japanese Constitution in Okinawa; demand that the United States compensate Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands for all losses and reconstruction costs caused by the U.S. military occupation and war damage.

    日共“七大”通过决议
    谴责岸信介政府破坏中日关系
    要求美国占领军立即撤出冲绳岛
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本共产党第七次代表大会通过了促进日中关系正常化的决议。
    决议指出，岸信介政府不顾日本人民的迫切要求，一贯妨害日中友好关系的发展，最近更全面地破坏了第四次日中贸易协定、渔业协定和两国人民间的文化交流活动，破坏了经过日中两国人民多年来的努力而建立起来的友好关系。决议说，渴望日中友好的日本人民对于岸信介政府在处理刘连仁事件和长崎侮辱中国国旗事件中所采取的态度，绝对不能宽恕。
    决议指责岸信介政府容许美国在日本建立军事基地、把核武器运进日本、使日本“自卫队”进行核武装和拼凑东北亚军事同盟的战争政策。决议说，所有这些都是为敌视中国的美国原子战略体制服务的。
    决议强调指出，岸信介政府的敌视中国的政策是为了驱使日本人民为美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务。
    决议说，日本的工人阶级和其他阶层的人民为了粉碎岸信介政府的敌视中国的政策，为了恢复日中正常关系，为了发展日中贸易和文化交流以及打开和平共处的道路，已经行动起来。决议说，日本共产党要站在日本人民的最前列来推动恢复日中邦交和日中友好等运动，以便使这些运动发展成为全体人民的运动，来阻止岸信介政府的核武装政策和拼凑东北亚军事同盟的阴谋，并且为废除“日蒋条约”和从速恢复日中邦交而奋斗。
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本共产党第七次代表大会在7月30日举行的全体会议上，通过了一项关于冲绳问题的决议。决议要求美国立即从冲绳撤出它的军队和军事基地，把冲绳归还日本。
    决议指出，美帝国主义者正在从军事上和政治上加强对冲绳的控制，并且公然表示要永久霸占冲绳。
    决议指出，现在冲绳已经变成美国的导弹基地，从冲绳基地起飞的携带核武器的美国飞机在日本上空飞行。但是，岸信介政府对此连半句抗议也没有提出。
    决议着重指出，冲绳不仅是美帝国主义者的原子战略体系中针对中苏两国的侵略基地和镇压日本民族解放运动的据点，而且日益发挥着它做为镇压亚非各民族的反帝、反殖民主义与争取独立斗争的据点以及加强控制和剥削亚非人民的据点的作用。
    决议说，日共“七大”对为争取日本的独立与和平以及亚非各民族的解放而一向反对把冲绳变成美军基地、要求把冲绳归还日本的八十万冲绳县民和日本爱国民主力量，表示深切的敬意。
    决议说，日共将团结日本全国人民的力量，为达到下列目的而奋斗到底：要求美国立即无条件地把冲绳和小笠原群岛归还日本；反对把冲绳变成导弹基地，撤销一切美军基地；立即从冲绳撤出美国军队；在冲绳完全实施日本宪法；要求美国赔偿冲绳和小笠原群岛由于被美军占领和遭受战争灾害的一切损失以及复兴所需的费用。
