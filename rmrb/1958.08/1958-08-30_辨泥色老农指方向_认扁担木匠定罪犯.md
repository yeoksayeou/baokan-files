    Distinguishing Mud Color, Old Farmer Points the Way; Recognizing Shoulder Pole, Carpenter Identifies the Criminal

    One day, a fat pig belonging to Zheng Guirong's family in Taiping Township, Wangcheng County, Hunan, was stolen. The culprit only left a shoulder pole at the scene. The public security personnel took this shoulder pole to the masses for identification. At that time, an old farmer named Wang Shaoyuan emerged from the crowd. He carefully examined it for a while and said, "I can't recognize the shoulder pole, but I recognize the mud on it. This mud is called 'pig blood mud,' and it's only found in Baiquan Township and Xiangtan. You can go there to find the criminal."

    The public security personnel went to Baiquan Township and saw that the soil there was indeed different from other places. So, they asked everyone to identify the shoulder pole. Everyone said that the shoulder pole was made smoothly and delicately and must have been made by the old carpenter Song Kaiwu. The public security personnel went to Song's house. As soon as Song Kaiwu saw the shoulder pole, he said: I was just about to look for it, but you brought it here. This shoulder pole was still here the day before yesterday, but it disappeared yesterday. The thief came from the pigsty, so he must be familiar with my house. I suspect Xu Zengde did it. He has been acting suspiciously and has come to my house three times recently. He now lives in Nangu Township, Xiangtan."

    The public security personnel went to Nangu, and it turned out that Xu Zengde had been out for a few days and would not return until tomorrow night. When he returned, he was carrying a large basket of pork. Under questioning by the public security personnel, Xu Zengde was speechless and had to confess the entire theft process.

    辨泥色老农指方向  认扁担木匠定罪犯
    一天，湖南望城县太平乡郑桂荣家里的一口肥猪，被偷走了。罪犯只在现场留下了一条扁担。公安人员就把这根扁担，拿给群众辨认。当时，人群中闪出一位名叫王少元的老农，他仔细端详了一阵，说：“扁担我没认出，可是扁担上的泥巴我却认得。这泥叫做‘猪血泥’，只有白泉乡和湘潭才有。你们可到那里去找罪犯。”
    公安人员到了白泉乡，见那里的泥土果然与别处不同。于是，便找大家认扁担。大家都说这扁担做的光滑秀气，一定是出自老木匠宋开吾之手。公安人员到了宋家，宋开吾一见扁担，就说：我正要找它，你们却送来了。这扁担前天还在这里，昨天就不见了。偷扁担的是从猪栏里来的，看来对我家很熟。我怀疑是徐增德干的，他近来鬼头鬼脑来我家三次。现在住在湘潭南谷乡。”
    公安人员到了南谷，正好徐增德外出几天，明夜才回。回来时，还带着一大筐猪肉。在公安人员讯问下，徐增德无言以对，只好供认了全部盗窃过程。
