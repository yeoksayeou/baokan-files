Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: In the era of the great leap forward in socialist construction, in order to adapt to the new situation of the surging and unprecedentedly flourishing new folk songs and other mass creations, and the new situation of the whole party and the whole people engaging in folk song collection, the capital held the National Folk Literature Workers Conference. More than 200 representatives from folk poets, singers, folk literature workers, mass culture work cadres, and writers and artists from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, from July 9th to 17th, enthusiastically discussed how to strengthen folk literature work, in order to keep up with the development of production leaps and mass creation, so that folk literature can better serve socialist construction.

Chairman Mao Zedong received all the representatives attending the meeting. Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the meeting. Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding speech based on the discussions at the conference.

The conference listened to Jia Zhi's report on folk literature work. More than 40 representatives spoke at the conference. They vividly introduced the situation of the vigorous development of folk songs and quick clapper rhymes since the Great Leap Forward, which promoted socialist production and construction. Many regions have seen a new situation of "the more intense the production, the more active the creation." Jiangxi Province has already seen the emergence of more than 5,000 mass creation organizations such as "Mountain Song Societies." There are more than 1,000 folk poets in Hong'an County, Hubei. More than 500,000 mass poems appeared on the rectification big-character posters on the construction site of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. In Xiyang County, Shanxi, a village created more than 1,000 quick clapper poems in three days. A cooperative in Tumote Banner, Inner Mongolia, published three collections of folk songs. Since the whole party and the whole people started collecting folk songs, the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have published thousands of folk song anthologies. Folk literature resources are extremely rich throughout the country. Since liberation, great achievements have been made in the collection and organization of folk literature. Folk literature works of more than 40 ethnic groups in the country have been published, published, or translated into Chinese and other ethnic minority languages. This is only a very small part of the entire treasure of folk literature.

This conference solved many major problems in folk literature work and established the socialist direction of folk literature work. The meeting held that since the May Fourth Movement, there has been a struggle between two lines in the treatment of folk literature and folk literature work. Bourgeois literati have always despised folk literature, or regarded it as "antiques" and "vases." The proletariat not only respects the creation of the working people, values folk literature, but also regards it as the foundation for the development of a new socialist culture. In particular, since Chairman Mao clearly put forward the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, the collection and organization of folk literature have been carried out more vigorously, enriching the new literature and art and promoting the development and popularization of new literature and art. After liberation, various bourgeois views in folk literature work were struggled against. The ideas of despising folk literature represented by Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng were criticized, the bourgeois folklore represented by Zhong Jingwen was exposed, and the tendency of Han chauvinism and local nationalism in folk literature work was also criticized, clearing the way for greater development of folk literature work in the future.

After discussion, everyone reached a consensus on the value and role of folk literature. The conference held that folk literature is the creation of the working people themselves, and it directly expresses the thoughts, feelings, demands, and aspirations of the working people. Many outstanding traditional works are the essence of national culture and also historical records of the lives and struggles of the working people. The new songs and ballads that express the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture reflect the heroic spirit of the working people in conquering nature and creating a better life, and are the budding of communist literature. They have become powerful propaganda weapons to encourage the masses to carry out socialist construction, and at the same time, will greatly promote the further popularization and nationalization of our country's literature and art.

The conference determined the folk literature work policy of comprehensive collection, focused organization, vigorous promotion, and strengthened research. All localities and ethnic groups have rich treasures of folk literature, which should be widely collected. First of all, folk literature works from various revolutionary periods and socialist construction periods should be collected, and outstanding traditional works should also be collected in a timely manner. On the basis of comprehensive collection, organize in a focused manner, first organize current new works and important traditional works. A scientific attitude and method should be established to distinguish between essence and dross. Works for mass reading can be appropriately processed on the basis of faithful records, and materials for scientific research should be kept in their original form without modification. The collection, organization, compilation, and selection work shall be the responsibility of the township, county, province, and central levels. All localities shall plan to publish a set of folk song collections, a set of folk tale collections, a set of folk rap and singing, and a set of local opera collections. In areas with ethnic minorities, important works of ethnic minorities should be organized, compiled, and printed. The Chinese Folk Literature and Art Research Association and the Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will compile and select various national folk literature anthologies on the basis of the selected collections published in various localities. All localities should also organize forces to strengthen the research work on folk literature in order to promote the development of mass creation and promote outstanding works.

This conference was convened by the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Research Association. Guo Moruo, Lao She, Zheng Zhenduo, Liu Zhiming, Yang Hansheng, Xiao San, Jiang Shaoyuan, Gu Jiegang, Yuan Shuipai, Xu Jiarui, and Li Yaqun attended the conference, and many people spoke at the meeting. The conference finally adopted a new charter, re-elected the Council of the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Research Association, elected 92 directors, and elected Guo Moruo as chairman, and Zhou Yang, Lao She, and Zheng Zhenduo as vice chairmen. During the meeting, folk singers and artists attending the conference organized a lively evening party and used their beautiful singing to congratulate the success of the conference.

    全面搜集　重点整理　大力推广　加强研究
    让万里山河开遍民间文艺之花
    全国民间文学工作者大会确定今后工作方针
    新华社1日讯　在社会主义建设大跃进的时代，为了适应新民歌及其他群众创作气势磅礴、空前繁荣和全党全民动手采风的新形势，首都召开了全国民间文学工作者大会。来自全国各省、市、自治区的民间诗人、歌手、民间文学工作者、群众文化工作干部和作家、艺术家的代表二百多人，从7月9日到17日，热烈地讨论了如何加强民间文学的工作，以便跟上生产跃进和群众创作的发展，使民间文学更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    毛泽东主席曾接见到会全体代表。陈毅副总理到会讲了话。中共中央宣传部副部长周扬根据大会讨论作了总结发言。
    大会听取了贾芝关于民间文学工作的报告。四十多位代表在大会上发了言。他们生动地介绍了大跃进以来民歌快板风起云涌，推动了社会主义生产建设的情况。许多地区都出现了“生产越紧张，创作越活跃”的新局面。江西省已涌现群众创作组织“山歌社”等五千多个。湖北红安县有一千多位民间诗人。武汉钢铁公司工地的整风大字报上出现了五十多万首群众诗歌。山西昔阳县一个村子三天内创作了一千多首快板诗。内蒙古土默特旗一个合作社就出了三本民歌集。自从全党全民动手采风以来，目前各省、市、自治区已出版了数以千计的民歌选集。全国各地民间文学蕴藏极为丰富，解放后民间文学的搜集、整理工作有很大成绩，全国有四十多个民族的民间文学作品已经发表、出版或翻译成了汉文及其他民族文字。这还仅仅是整个民间文学宝藏的极少一部分。
    这次大会，解决了民间文学工作中许多重大问题，确立了民间文学工作的社会主义方向。会议认为，从“五四”起，在对待民间文学和民间文学工作中就存在着两条道路的斗争。资产阶级文人一向鄙视民间文学，或者把它当作“古董”和“花瓶”。无产阶级则不但尊重劳动人民的创作，重视民间文学，并且把它看作是发展社会主义新文化的基础。特别是从1942年毛主席在延安文艺座谈会讲话中明确提出文艺为工农兵服务的方向以后，民间文艺的搜集、整理工作就更加蓬勃地开展起来，使新文艺得到了丰富的滋养，促进了新文艺的发展和群众化。解放后，对民间文学工作中的各种资产阶级观点进行了斗争，批判了以胡风、冯雪峰为代表的蔑视民间文学的思想，揭露了以钟敬文为代表的资产阶级民俗学，还批评了民间文学工作中大汉族主义和地方民族主义的倾向，为今后民间文学工作的更大发展扫清了道路。
    经过讨论，大家对民间文学的价值、作用取得了一致的认识。大会认为，民间文学是劳动人民自己的创作，它直接表现劳动人民的思想、感情、要求和愿望。许多优秀的传统作品是民族文化的精华，也是劳动人民生活和斗争的历史记录。表现工农业大跃进的新歌谣，反映了劳动人民征服自然、创造美好生活的英雄气魄，是共产主义文学的萌芽。它们已成为鼓舞群众进行社会主义建设的有力的宣传武器，同时对我国文学艺术进一步群众化、民族化，也将起很大的促进作用。
    大会确定了全面搜集、重点整理、大力推广、加强研究的民间文学工作方针。各地方、各民族都有丰富的民间文学宝藏，应当广泛搜集。首先要搜集各个革命时期和社会主义建设时期的民间文学作品，传统的优秀作品也要及时搜集。在全面搜集的基础上，有重点地进行整理工作，首先整理当前的新作品和重要的传统作品。要树立科学的态度和方法，分清精华和糟粕，供群众阅读的作品，可在忠实记录的基础上适当加工，供科学研究的资料，则应该保持原样，不加改动。搜集、整理、编选工作采取由乡、县、省到中央层层负责的办法，各地都要有计划地出版一套民歌选集、一套民间故事选集、一套民间说唱和一套地方戏曲选集。在有少数民族的地方，应该把少数民族的重要作品整理、编印出来。中国民间文艺研究会和中国科学院文学研究所则在各地出版选集的基础上分别编选全国的各种民间文学选集。各地还要组织力量，加强对民间文学的研究工作，以促进群众创作的发展，推广优秀的作品。
    这次大会是由中国民间文艺研究会召集的。郭沫若、老舍、郑振铎、刘芝明、阳翰笙、萧三、江绍原、顾颉刚、袁水拍、徐嘉瑞、李亚群等都出席了大会，许多人在会上发了言。大会最后通过了新的章程，改选了中国民间文艺研究会理事会，选出理事九十二人，推选郭沫若为主席，周扬、老舍、郑振铎为副主席。会议期间，出席大会的民间歌手和艺人组织了一次生动的晚会，用他们优美的歌唱，祝贺大会的成功。
