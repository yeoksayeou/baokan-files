Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 16th. The Soviet "Red Star" published an article by Baorenke titled "Old Tune," commenting on the memorandum on "non-recognition" of the People's Republic of China released by the U.S. State Department on August 11th.

The article said, "The formulators of the 'brink of war' policy attempt to disguise themselves as envoys of peace, insisting that it is People's China, rather than the United States which pursues an aggressive policy, that is creating tension in the Far East. However, as everyone knows, it is the United States that is creating tension not only in the Far East but also in the Near East. It is the American imperialists who are acting as world policemen. No matter how the authors of this infamous memorandum try to twist and turn, they still reveal that without U.S. backing, the U.S. puppets—Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem—would 'not be able to hold out for long.'"

The article refuted the U.S. memorandum's nonsense that the United States could not recognize People's China because of the existence of Chiang Kai-shek's "legitimate government." The article said, who doesn't know that Chiang Kai-shek is just a political corpse, he cannot represent anyone or anything, and the only reason he can occupy Taiwan is because the U.S. military occupies the island.

The article wrote that U.S. State Department officials are talking nonsense about the victory of the Chinese revolution being a "temporary phenomenon." They are trying to make the world believe that the people's regime in China is not permanent. The article said that the United States once harbored such hopes for the Soviet Union. It also did not want to recognize our country for many years, but life mercilessly mocked the short-sighted American politicians. Now they dislike the People's Republic of China and are eagerly waiting for it to "disappear." However, on the contrary, People's China is marching forward with great strides. Its power is growing day by day, and the Chinese people infinitely trust and fully support their Communist Party and People's Government. The People's Republic of China has established formal diplomatic relations with dozens of countries, maintains trade relations with seventy countries, and maintains cultural ties and friendly contacts with more than one hundred countries. All this shows that the People's Republic of China is not isolated. The People's Republic of China has friends all over the world, and its domestic and international situation has achieved unprecedented stability.

The article refuted the U.S. State Department memorandum's nonsense that restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations "would undermine—if not destroy—the United Nations." The article said that, on the contrary, the United States is undermining the prestige of the United Nations by obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat and rights in the United Nations, making it impossible for the United Nations to effectively perform its functions in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

The article continued, why did the U.S. State Department rush to publish this memorandum? This is because the calls from various countries for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations are getting louder and louder. The development of the People's Republic of China as a major country, its prestige in the international community, and its influence on the process and development of international relations are increasingly making the U.S. ruling circles uneasy. The U.S. State Department issued the memorandum in an attempt to put diplomatic pressure on some countries to prevent them from changing their position on People's China.

The article concluded by saying that the American imperialists, blinded by their hatred of everything progressive, are prepared to drag the world into the abyss of a new war. However, the overestimating imperialist politicians should have realized long ago that in an era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, no amount of nonsensical memoranda can stop the tide of the times.

### 现实无情地嘲笑了美国政客　苏联“红星报”载文抨击美国国务院备忘录

　　现实无情地嘲笑了美国政客
　　苏联“红星报”载文抨击美国国务院备忘录
    新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联“红星报”发表了鲍任科的一篇题为“老一套”的文章，评论美国国务院11日公布的关于“不承认”中华人民共和国的备忘录。
    文章说，“战争边缘”政策的制订者企图装扮成和平使者，硬说是人民中国、而不是执行侵略政策的美国在制造远东紧张局势。但是，众所周知，正是美国不仅在远东而且也在中近东制造紧张局势。正是美国帝国主义者在充当世界宪兵的角色。不管这个臭名远扬的备忘录作者们如何闪烁其词，他们还是吐露出了：如果没有美国撑腰，美国的傀儡们——蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳就“不可能招架很久”。
    文章驳斥美国备忘录中所谓由于蒋介石的“合法政府”存在，美国才不能承认人民中国这种胡说。文章说，谁不知道，蒋介石只是一具政治僵尸，他不能代表任何人和任何东西，他之所以能够盘踞台湾，只是因为美国军队霸占了这个岛屿。
    文章写道，美国国务院官员胡说什么中国革命的胜利是“暂时的现象”。他们企图使世界相信，中国的人民政权不是永久性的。文章说，美国过去对苏联也曾抱过这样的希望。它也很多年一直不想承认我国，但生活无情地嘲笑了鼠目寸光的美国政客。现在他们不喜欢中华人民共和国，并且迫不及待地等它“消失”。可是，恰恰相反，人民中国正在阔步迈进。它的威力日益增长，中国人民无限信任和全力支持自己的共产党和人民政府。中华人民共和国已经同几十个国家建立了正式的外交关系，它同七十个国家保持着贸易关系，而且同一百多个国家保持着文化联系和友好接触。这一切说明，中华人民共和国不是孤立的。中华人民共和国的朋友遍天下，它的国内和国际情况获得了空前的稳固。
    文章驳斥了美国国务院备忘录中所谓恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利“将破坏——如果不是消灭的话——联合国”的胡说，文章说，恰恰相反：美国由于阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位和权利，从而破坏了联合国的威信，使得联合国无法根据联合国宪章有效地履行它的职能。
    文章接着说，美国国务院急急忙忙地发表这项备忘录是为了什么呢？这是因为各国要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的呼声越来越响亮了。中华人民共和国作为一个大国的发展和在国际上的威望以及它对于国际关系进程和发展的影响，越来越使美国统治集团感到不安。美国国务院发出备忘录，就是企图通过外交途径对一些国家施加压力，以防止这些国家改变对人民中国的立场。
    文章最后说，被对一切进步东西的仇恨迷住了心窍的美帝国主义者准备把世界拖入新战争的深渊。但是，不自量力的帝国主义政客早就应该明白，在东风压倒西风的时代里，任何胡说八道的备忘录也不能阻挡时代的潮流的。
