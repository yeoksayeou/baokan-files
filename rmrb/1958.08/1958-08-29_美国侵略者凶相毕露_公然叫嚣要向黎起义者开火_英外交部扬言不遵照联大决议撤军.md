Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch from Beirut: American troops commander Adams refused on the 27th to withdraw American troops from their positions surrounding the Basta district of Beirut, which is controlled by insurgents, and publicly threatened to open fire on the Lebanese insurgents in this area.

This head of the American aggressor troops issued the above threat to the press after supporters of Shamun in the Basta district issued a warning on the 26th, setting a deadline for the American troops to withdraw from these positions. In a statement to reporters, he arrogantly stated that he would not stop the American military provocation against the insurgents in the Lebanese capital. He said that his troops had been ordered to conduct "sufficient" "retaliation" if they were subjected to "hostile attacks." Beirut has seen consecutive days of fighting since the American troops stepped up their military provocations. On the 27th, armed clashes occurred between Shamun's supporters and insurgents in the Hamud district. At least five people were killed and seven wounded in the clashes.

It is reported that U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock met with Shamun and Chehab yesterday. The content of the meeting was not disclosed.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 27th: The invading American troops continue to rent houses in and around Beirut. This practice of the invading American troops shows their conspiracy to disregard the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the early withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and to remain entrenched in Lebanon for a long time.

Recently, two unfinished buildings on the west side of Beirut, facing the sea, have been completely leased by the American aggressor troops. The lease term for one of the buildings, called "Federal Hotel," is three months.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 28th: The Damascus newspaper "Al-Nour" reported today that Lebanese opposition leaders Yafi, Ueni, Karami, and Amon held another meeting yesterday at Salam's home. It is reported that another meeting was held, attended by Salam, Karami, Taki al-Din al-Solh, and Bizi.

The newspaper also said that Taki al-Din al-Solh and Bizi met yesterday with the newly elected President Chehab and discussed the development of the domestic and international situation with him. "Al-Nour" quoted opposition figures as saying that Chehab's talks with opposition leaders involved general methods of cooperation, as well as arrangements to be made to ensure the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and the termination of the UN observer mission in Lebanon.

Meanwhile, according to the Damascus newspaper "Al-Nasr" today, the opposition leaders have decided to entrust Karami to meet with Hammarskjöld during his visit to Beirut, representing the opposition leaders to demand the immediate withdrawal of American troops and UN observers.

At the same time, according to the Damascus newspaper "Al-Nasr" today, the insurgent forces in Beirut held a military parade in the Basta district on the 27th. Many armored vehicles and ambulance teams participated in the parade along with the insurgent forces. The insurgent forces held high the Lebanese flag and other flags. Tens of thousands of residents cheered the insurgent forces.

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: London dispatch: The British government openly disregards the resolution of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly demanding the early withdrawal of British aggressor troops from the Near and Middle East. A Foreign Office spokesman said publicly on the 26th that it was still "too early" to predict the date of the British troops' withdrawal from Jordan.

Prior to this, news from Amman said that the British aggressor troops authorities and the Jordanian government have repeatedly emphasized that British troops "will never" withdraw from Jordan soon because the United Nations unanimously adopted the Arab countries' resolution on the Middle East issue.

Not only that, but Britain has recently dispatched four more warships to the Middle East.

　　美国侵略者凶相毕露
    公然叫嚣要向黎起义者开火
    英外交部扬言不遵照联大决议撤军
    新华社28日讯　贝鲁特消息：侵黎美军司令亚当斯在27日拒绝使美军从它包围贝鲁特起义者控制的巴斯塔区的阵地中撤出，并且公然叫嚣要向这一区里的黎巴嫩起义者开火。
    这个美国侵略军的头子是在巴斯塔区中的支持者党在26日发出限期要美军撤离这些阵地的警告以后，向报界发出上述叫嚣的。他在对新闻记者发表的声明中，横蛮地表示不肯停止美军向黎巴嫩首都起义者进行的这种军事挑衅行动。他说，他的军队已经得到命令在遭到“敌意攻击”时，就要进行“足量”的“回击”。在美军加紧进行军事挑衅活动以后，贝鲁特接连两天发生了战事。27日在哈茂德区，夏蒙的支持者和起义者发生了武装冲突。在冲突中至少有五人死亡，七人受伤。
    据报道，美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克昨天同夏蒙和谢哈布进行了会谈。会谈内容没有透露。
    新华社贝鲁特27日电　侵黎美军继续在贝鲁特市内外租用房屋。侵黎美军的这种做法表明它阴谋不顾联合国大会通过的关于要美军早日撤出黎巴嫩的决议，而长期在黎巴嫩盘踞下去。
    最近，贝鲁特市西面面海的两座还没有竣工的大楼已经被美国侵略军全部包租下来。其中一座名叫“联邦旅馆”的大楼的租用期限是三个月。
    新华社大马士革28日电　大马士革“光明报”今天报道，黎巴嫩反对派领袖雅非、乌埃尼、卡拉米和阿蒙等昨天又在萨拉姆的家里举行了一次会议。据报道，另外还举行了一次会议，参加会议的有萨拉姆、卡拉米、塔基丁·索勒哈和比齐。
    报纸又说，塔基丁·索勒哈和比齐昨天会晤了新当选为总统的谢哈布，并且同他讨论了国内外局势的发展。“光明报”援引反对派人士的话说，谢哈布同反对派领袖们的会谈涉及了一般的合作办法，以及为了使外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩及停止联合国观察员在黎巴嫩的职务所应作出的安排。
    据“胜利报”今天说，反对党领袖们已决定委托卡拉米在哈马舍尔德访问贝鲁特时同他举行会谈，代表反对党领袖们要求立即撤出美国军队和联合国观察员。
    同时，据大马士革“胜利报”今天报道，贝鲁特的起义部队27日在巴斯塔区举行了军事检阅。同起义部队一起参加检阅的有许多装甲车和救护队。起义部队高举着黎巴嫩国旗和其他旗帜。成千上万的居民向起义部队欢呼。
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府公然无视联合国大会紧急特别会议要求英国侵略军队早日撤出中近东的决议，外交部发言人26日公开说，现在要预言英国军队撤出约旦的日期还“为时过早”。
    在这以前，从安曼传出的消息说，英国侵略军当局和约旦政府都一再强调表示，英国军队“决不会”由于联合国一致通过了阿拉伯国家关于中东问题的决议而很快撤出约旦。
    不仅如此，英国最近还向中东增派了四艘军舰。
