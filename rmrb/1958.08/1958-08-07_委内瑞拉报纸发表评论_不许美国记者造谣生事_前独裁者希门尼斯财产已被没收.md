Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Caracas: Most newspapers in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, have published commentaries condemning U.S. journalists in Venezuela for spreading rumors and engaging in activities hostile to Venezuela.

Almost all newspapers have criticized "Time" magazine for "distorting the situation in Venezuela."

The "Últimas Noticias" newspaper used almost an entire page to condemn "Chicago Tribune" journalist Jules Dubois for opposing the current Venezuelan government.

"El Universal" used nearly four columns on the 3rd and 4th to criticize Associated Press reporter Larry Allen for distorting reports of the Venezuelan people's views of the United States.

Some newspapers have also published cartoons and commentaries accusing U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela Edward J. Sparks of being a conspirator and a friend of former Minister of Defense Castro León. Castro León was deported by the Venezuelan government after his attempted reactionary military coup on July 23 failed.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Caracas: The Venezuelan Attorney General recently announced that the Venezuelan government has confiscated over $100 million in property from former Venezuelan President, the overthrown great dictator, Jiménez. Investigations into his property and confiscation efforts are still ongoing.

According to Venezuelan authorities, this great dictator, who ruled Venezuela for nearly a decade, took away between $250 million and $300 million in funds when he fled after the victory of the January 23rd Revolution this year. After arriving in the United States, he immediately bought a house for $400,000.

It is reported that the Venezuelan court is preparing to request the United States to extradite this public enemy of the Venezuelan people in order to try him.

    新华社6日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的大多数报纸都发表评论，谴责在委内瑞拉的美国记者造谣生事，进行敌视委内瑞拉的活动。
    几乎所有报纸都指责美国“时代”杂志“歪曲委内瑞拉的局势”。
    “最后消息”报差不多用整个一版的篇幅谴责“芝加哥论坛报”的记者茹而斯·杜波依斯反对委内瑞拉现政权的活动。
    “寰球报”3日和4日用了几乎是四栏的地位指责美联社记者拉里·艾伦歪曲报道委内瑞拉人民对美国的看法。
    有些报纸还刊登漫画和发表评论，指责美国驻委内瑞拉大使爱德华·杰·斯巴克斯是阴谋分子、前国防部长卡斯特罗·莱昂的朋友。卡斯特罗·莱昂在7月23日企图策动反动军事政变失败后已经被委内瑞拉政府驱逐出境。
    新华社6日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉检察长最近宣布，委内瑞拉政府已经没收了委内瑞拉前总统、已经被打倒的大独裁者希门尼斯一亿多美元的财产。目前，对他的财产的调查和没收工作仍然在继续进行。
    据委内瑞拉当局估计，这个统治了委内瑞拉近十年的大独裁者，在今年1月23日革命胜利以后逃跑时带走了二亿五千万到三亿美元的资金。他到美国以后，就立刻用四十万美元买了一所住宅。
    据报道，委内瑞拉法院正在准备要求美国引渡这个委内瑞拉人民的公敌，以便对他进行审判。
