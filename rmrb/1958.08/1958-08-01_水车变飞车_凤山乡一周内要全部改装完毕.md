    Waterwheels Transformed into Flying Wheels
    Fengshan Township to Complete All Modifications Within a Week
    According to the Xinhua Daily, Fengshan Township in Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province, has installed ball bearing races and flywheels on old-fashioned waterwheels, turning every waterwheel into a “flying wheel,” with one waterwheel doing the work of two.
    Fengshan Township has persisted in the fight against drought for more than eighty days. Currently, the township's existing ponds and dams have little water remaining, and most paddy fields need water drawn from the distant Shijiu Lake for irrigation. Therefore, existing water-lifting tools are no longer sufficient. For example, if using ninety waterwheels to draw water from the lake over the mountains and across the land, it generally requires passing through ten *li* to irrigate distant fields, significantly increasing water loss along the way. At the same time, rice seedlings urgently need topdressing and weeding, so all labor cannot be devoted entirely to operating waterwheels for drought resistance as before. Under these circumstances, the township Party committee, together with masters and members from various iron and woodworking cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, decided to install "ball bearing races" and "flywheels" on the existing waterwheels of each cooperative to increase the wheel's gliding force and rotational power, reduce the burden on human labor, and improve water-lifting efficiency. Experiments have proved that the improved waterwheels can save half the manpower per unit and double the water-lifting efficiency. Therefore, it was decided to complete the modification of all over one thousand waterwheels in the township within one week.
    Originally, "ball bearing races" had to be bought from other places, but now, after research by blacksmith masters, "local ball bearing races" have been successfully imitated, with very good gliding force. "Flywheels" are also made using bamboo and scrap iron strips as the framework, poured with cement. The modification method is also very simple, just replace the original old-fashioned sliding bearings at both ends of the axle with "ball bearing races," and then fit a "flywheel" on each end of the axle.
    Currently, all agricultural cooperatives in the township are modifying waterwheels day and night, persisting in the fight against drought.

### 水车变飞车  凤山乡一周内要全部改装完毕

    水车变飞车
    凤山乡一周内要全部改装完毕
    据新华日报讯　江苏省高淳县凤山乡在旧式水车上安上弹子盘和飞轮，使部部水车变飞车，一部水车抵两部用。
    凤山乡已经坚持了八十多天的抗旱斗争。目前，全乡现有塘坝存水不多，大部分稻田需水要从距离较远的石臼湖引水灌溉，因此，现有的戽水工具已不能应付。如用九十垛车将湖水翻山过地，一般都要经过十里路，才能引灌到远田，中途耗水量增加很大；同时，稻苗正急待追肥除草，所有劳力也不能再像以前那样全部投入车水抗旱。在这种情况下，乡党委与各铁、木业社和农业社的师傅和社员们，便研究决定将各社已有的水车，装上“弹子盘”和“飞轮”，增加车子滑力和旋转力，减轻人力负担，提高车水效率。试验证明，改良后的水车每部可节省一半人力，戽水效率也增加一倍。因此，就决定在一星期内全乡一千余部水车改装完成。
    “弹子盘”原来需要到外地买，现在经铁匠师傅钻研，已经仿制成功“土弹子盘”，滑力很好；“飞轮”也是用毛竹和废铁条做筋骨，用水泥浇制。改制办法也很简单，只要在车轴两端，将原有的旧式滑轴换成“弹子盘”，再在轴两头套上“飞轮”各一只就行了。
    目前，全乡各农业社都在日夜改装水车，坚持抗旱。
