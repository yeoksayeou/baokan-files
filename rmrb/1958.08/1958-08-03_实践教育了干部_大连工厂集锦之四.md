    Practice Educated the Cadres
    ——Dalian Factory Collection, Part Four
  　Zheng Zhong
    The grassroots leading cadres of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, during the rectification movement, discarded the "three winds and five airs," implemented the working style of putting politics in command and following the mass line, and participated in production labor alongside the workers, achieving very good results. Cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management have promoted the situation of doubling production this year.

    During the great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, the masses exposed a large number of problems: the "three winds and five airs" in the leadership's ideology and work style, being detached from the masses and detached from reality. In the past, most cadres had an unclear understanding of the need to rely on the masses and the working class to run enterprises well. For a long time, they were deeply influenced by the "one-chief system," and the relationship between cadres and the masses was abnormal. The specific manifestations were: (1) opposing politics to professional work. Many cadres believed: "I do administrative work, and political work is mainly the business of the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League." Therefore, they never actively solved the ideological problems of the masses, and even complained that the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League had not educated the masses well. Some cadres said: "If the production tasks are completed, everything is fine; if the tasks are not completed, no amount of politics is useful." (2) Seeing only things and not people. Many cadres had a poor understanding that people are the decisive factor in our cause. They saw more of the backward aspects of the masses and less of the positive aspects. They did not do mass work and stimulated production with heavy rewards and punishments. (3) Replacing the mass line working method with administrative orders. Wang Bingshan, the leader of the vehicle workshop, said: "In the past, when I assigned production tasks, I emphasized that administration is command, and you have to do it whether you want to or not; if I tell you to do it, you have to do it." This kind of work style was common among administrative leading cadres. (4) Not caring about the hardships of the masses. These thoughts and work styles suppressed the enthusiasm of the masses and affected the development of productive forces.

    The experience of the rectification movement educated all the cadres of this factory, once again proving that Chairman Mao's instructions on working methods are completely correct. Without implementing the mass line, the great development of the production movement is impossible.

    Through the rectification movement, two major problems were solved relatively thoroughly and deeply among leaders at all levels. One is putting politics in command, using the intangible to drive the tangible. The other is firmly believing in the majority of the masses and better implementing the Party's mass line working method.

    Putting Politics in Command, Using the Intangible to Drive the Tangible

    Since the rectification movement, everyone has deeply realized that all work must put politics in command. Wang Bingshan, the leader of the vehicle workshop, changed his past attitude and said: "Now I realize that without doing political work, all problems are difficult to solve. For example, the amount of oil used by oilers always exceeded the quota when using command methods in the past; now, after mobilizing the workers and having a debate, the problem has been solved, and the amount of oil used has been reduced from 92 kilograms to 72 kilograms." In the past, backward people were generally discriminated against and often treated with a rude attitude, without analyzing the reasons or providing specific help. Now, we understand that we must be good at waiting, patiently guiding the masses, and gradually improving their awareness. The fact that backward elements have been transformed has made cadres realize that many backward people were not originally willing to be backward. The problem lies in how we do our work. In order to understand the masses, care for the masses, and educate the masses, vehicle, locomotive, and other workshops have established a system for Party members to make friends with the masses. Currently, the vehicle workshop has mobilized 213 Party members to make friends with 427 employees, visiting and talking to each other. Many family members are deeply moved.

    Grasp Advanced Thinking to Drive All Work Forward

    At the beginning of this year, the state stipulated that the factory's locomotive task in the first book was 160 units and the rolling stock task was 2,900 units. After discussion by the masses, it was finally determined that the number of locomotives would be 250 units and the number of rolling stock would be 4,000 to 4,500 units. During the double-anti movement, the airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, employees posted big-character posters: "Is 160 units conservative?" "Can 220 units be achieved in a leap forward?" After research and decision by the Party Committee, focusing on the mechanical workshop, the key link in the factory's production, it was proposed to leap forward from an annual output of 160 locomotives to 220 locomotives. This led to a great leap forward debate in all links of the factory, fiercely attacking conservative thinking. After the debate, on the basis of improving understanding and unifying thinking, the leap forward target of "220 (locomotives), 3,200 (freight cars), 18,000 (tons of castings)" was set. The employees also took practical actions to achieve the monthly leap forward plan. Conservative thinking was defeated without being attacked. The workers, whose minds have been liberated, are now proposing to break through "220, 3,200, 18,000, successfully trial-produce internal combustion locomotives by 'October 1,' and double production next year" as the goal of struggle.

    Practice has educated the cadres and enabled them to understand initially that in enterprise work, it is necessary to use dialectical materialism well, grasp the key points, establish a clear banner, use the advanced to drive the backward, and adhere to the working methods of using the intangible to drive the tangible and following the mass line.

    In abandoning the old and grasping the advanced, the cadres also used the method of looking at next year from this year and looking at the next step from this step. In this way, all aspects are mobilized. All work must be actively aimed at achieving the requirements of the next step, and weak links must also catch up quickly, so that all work is active. Not only is it necessary to look at next year from this year and look at the next step from this step, but next year can also drive this year, and the next step can also drive the previous step. For the future, it can completely promote the progress of the current work.

    Thousands of Difficulties, Handed Over to the Masses for Solution

    Difficulties are bound to be encountered in the Great Leap Forward, and our Great Leap Forward must include overcoming difficulties. What to do when encountering difficulties? The rectification movement actually educated the cadres that relying on the worker masses, all difficulties can be overcome. For example, during the double-anti movement, employees posted 700,000 big-character posters, totaling 754,938 opinions. 531,680 of them could be solved within the factory. At first, the cadres were frightened by so many opinions. However, after the Party committee proposed "Big-character posters go home, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and the leaders and the masses pick watermelons and sesame seeds together," the employees used about a week to solve 331,032 opinions. Through debate, 356 large watermelons were solved, deeply educating the cadres. Since then, the cadres have learned to consult with the masses whenever they encounter problems.

    For a long time, cadres have been infatuated with the style of the one-chief system, being stiff, simple, and rude, thus harming the enthusiasm of the masses and destroying the normal comrade-style relationship between leaders and the led in many places. This rectification movement insisted that cadres take the initiative to examine themselves, make public self-criticisms, and express their determination to correct their shortcomings and mistakes under the supervision of the masses. Many cadres repeatedly examined themselves in the rectification movement. Some even performed living newspaper dramas and used cartoons to expose their shortcomings to the masses, with very good results. After Comrade Tan Guangren, deputy director of the vehicle workshop, and Comrade Lei Buzeng, director of scheduling, jointly performed the living newspaper drama "Endless Skin-Tearing," it greatly inspired the workers. Sun Zhaode, who was relatively backward and had lax labor discipline, was moved and said, "The cadre's work style has really changed." He then set out 11 resolutions to correct his shortcomings and strive for advancement, and now he is actively involved in production.

    The significant effect of this approach lies in untangling the knots that had accumulated for a long time before the rectification, and opening up the first barrier to close relations between leaders and the led by speaking openly through public self-criticism, discussions with a small number of people, and individual conversations, so that those who were wrong could make self-criticisms and those who were not wrong could explain themselves clearly.

    Engaging in "Experimental Plots" and Participating in Labor

    Since March 19, all cadres above the rank of foreman in the factory have participated in labor. Because the cadres appeared among the worker masses in the posture of laborers, it had a great impact on the employees. First, in the past, cadres and workers only had contact on production work, without mutual help in thinking. After participating in labor, they had a concrete understanding of the workers' production, life, and thinking, their feelings were harmonious, and the workers told the cadres their innermost thoughts. Second, problems were discovered, measures were taken in a timely manner, work was improved, production was promoted, and the bureaucratic style of leadership was overcome. For example, in the past, electric furnaces in the casting workshop could not produce at the same time due to electricity consumption limits, which affected the amount of steel produced and hindered the leap forward. By engaging in "experimental plots," this problem was discovered and solved on the spot. As a result, the amount of molten steel in the electric furnace increased from 15 furnaces to 16 furnaces. The workers reflected that the leaders really solved the problem when they came down. Third, because leading cadres participated in production and engaged in "experimental plots," the production enthusiasm of the workers was greatly stimulated. For example, the workers in the bogie section of the vehicle workshop only processed four or five side frames a day, failing to complete the quota. Their thinking was that if the quota was not lowered, they would wait for three months, but after Sun Tianfu, the secretary of the general branch, went to participate in labor, the workers consciously conducted inspections, improved their understanding, and increased the output from five to sixteen. Practice has proved that this is a road that combines leadership with the masses, and unites politics and technology, being both red and expert.

    实践教育了干部
    ——大连工厂集锦之四
  　郑重
    大连机车车辆厂的基层领导干部，在整风运动中去掉了三风五气，贯彻执行了政治挂帅和群众路线的工作作风，和工人一道参加了生产劳动，收效很好。干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，促进了今年生产加一番的局面。
    大鸣、大放、大辩论中，群众所揭发出的大量问题，是：领导思想作风上的三风五气，脱离群众，脱离实际。过去多数干部对办好企业必须依靠群众、依靠工人阶级的认识不明确，长期以来受“一长制”的影响极深刻，干部和群众的关系不正常。具体的表现是：（一）把政治与业务对立起来。许多干部认为：“我是做行政工作的，政治工作主要是党、工、团的事情”。因此，群众有思想问题，从来不主动去解决，甚至埋怨党、工会、共青团没把群众教育好。有的干部说：“生产任务完成了，说什么都好；完不成任务，什么政治不政治都没用”。（二）只见物不见人。许多干部对于人是我们事业的决定因素认识很差，对于群众的落后方面看得多，积极方面看得少，不做群众工作，以重赏重罚刺激生产。（三）以行政命令代替了群众路线的工作方法。车辆车间王炳善工段长说：“我过去布置生产任务是强调行政就是命令，不干不行，叫你干你就得干”。像这种工作作风，在行政领导干部中带有普遍性。（四）不关心群众疾苦。这些思想作风压制群众积极性和影响生产力的发展。
    整风运动的经验教育了这个厂的全体干部，再一次证明毛主席关于工作方法的指示是十分正确的。不贯彻执行群众路线，生产运动的巨大发展是不可能的。
    经过整风运动，在各级领导人员中，比较深刻透彻地解决了两个重大的问题。一条是政治挂帅，以虚带实。一条是坚决相信群众的大多数，更好的贯彻执行了党的群众路线的工作方法。
    政治挂帅、以虚带实
    整风运动以来，大家深刻地体会到任何工作都必须政治挂帅，车辆车间工段长王炳善改变了过去的态度，他说：“现在体会到不做政治工作，一切问题难解决。比如油工用油量，过去使用命令方法，总是超过了指标；现在向工人做了动员，大家一辩论，问题就解决了，用油量由九十二公斤降为七十二公斤”。过去对待落后群众一般是歧视的，常常以粗暴的态度对待，不分析原因，不作具体帮助，现在懂得要善于等待，耐心的诱导群众，逐步提高群众觉悟。落后分子转变的事实，使干部认识到许多落后者原来并不是甘心落后的。问题在于我们的工作做的如何。为了做到了解群众，关心群众，教育群众，车辆机车等车间建立了党员同群众交朋友的制度。车辆车间目前发动了二百一十三名党员同四百二十七名职工交朋友，互相访问、谈心，好多家属深受感动。
    抓住先进思想，带动一切工作前进
    今年年初国家规定这个厂的机车任务第一本账是一百六十台，车辆二千九百辆。经过群众讨论最后确定机车为二百五十台，车辆四千至四千五百辆。在双反运动大鸣、大放、大辩论中，职工贴出大字报：“一百六十台是不是保守？”“二百二十台能不能跃进上来？”经过党委研究决定以全厂生产关键环节机械车间为主，提出了由年产机车一百六十台跃进到二百二十台的先进指标，于是带动了全厂各个环节展开了大跃进的辩论，向保守思想大开火，经过辩论在提高认识、统一思想的基础上，订下了“二百二十（机车）、三千二百（货车）、一万八千（吨铸件）”的跃进指标，职工们并以实际行动实现月度跃进计划。保守思想不攻自破了，思想解放了的工人同志，目前又提出突破“二百二十、三千二百、一万八千，为二百五十、四千五百、二万二千，‘十一’试制成功内燃机车，明年生产翻一番”的奋斗目标。
    实践教育了干部，并且使干部初步懂得了在企业工作中要很好地运用唯物辩证法，抓住纲，树立鲜明的旗帜，以先进带动落后，坚持以虚带实和群众路线的工作方法。
    在抛纲抓先进当中，干部也运用了今年看明年、上步看下步的办法，这样使个个方面都动起来了。一切工作都要为达到实现下一步的要求积极起来了，薄弱环节也要急起直追，全部工作活跃了。不仅今年看明年、上步看下步是必要的，而且明年还可以带动今年、下步还可以带动上步，为了将来完全可促进现在工作的进步。
    困难千万条，交给群众解决了
    大跃进中必然遇到困难，我们事业的大跃进就必须包括战胜困难在内。遇到困难怎么办？整风运动实际教育了干部，依靠工人群众，一切困难都可以克服。比如：双反运动中职工贴出七十万张大字报，共计七十五万四千九百三十八条意见，属于工厂内部可以解决的有五十三万一千六百八十条，开始干部被这样多的意见吓住了。但是，在党委提出“大字报回家，发动群众，依靠群众，领导和群众一块抱西瓜拣芝麻”以后，职工群众用一周左右的时间，就解决了三十三万一千零三十二条意见，经过辩论解决了三百五十六个大西瓜，深刻地教育了干部。从此，干部也就学会了遇事就找群众商量的办法。
    长期以来干部迷恋于一长制的作风，生硬、简单、粗暴，因而在不少地方伤害了群众的积极性，破坏了正常的同志式的领导和被领导之间的关系。这次整风运动坚持了干部引火烧身，当众检讨，表示决心在群众监督下改正自己的缺点和错误，不少干部在整风运动中反复的检查自己，有的还演出活报剧和用漫画揭露自己的缺点给群众看，效果十分良好。车辆车间副主任谭广仁同志和调度主任雷布增同志合演“扯不完的皮”活报剧以后，对工人启示很大。原来比较落后、劳动纪律松弛的孙兆德被感动地说：“干部作风真变了”，跟着自己也订出十一条改正缺点力争先进的决心书，现在生产积极了。
    这种作法的显著作用在于解开整风前长期积下的疙瘩，通过当众检查，少数人座谈，个别谈话等方法把话说开了，错的检讨，不是错的解释清楚，这样打开了密切领导和被领导之间关系的第一关。
    搞“试验田”，参加劳动
    自从3月19日开始到现在，全厂工长以上的干部都分别参加了劳动，由于干部以劳动者的姿态出现在工人群众中间，对职工的影响很大。第一、过去干部和工人只有生产工作上的接触，没有思想上的相互帮助，参加劳动以后，对工人生产、生活、思想情况有了具体了解，感情融洽了，工人向干部说了心里话。第二、发现了问题，及时采取措施，改进了工作，推动了生产，克服了领导上官僚主义作风。比如铸造车间电炉过去因为用电量限制两个炉不能同时生产，影响出钢量，阻碍跃进。通过搞“试验田”，发现了这个问题，并且就地研究解决了它，结果电炉熔化量，由十五炉提高到十六炉。工人反映说，领导下来真解决问题。第三、由于领导干部参加生产搞“试验田”。大大地激发了工人的生产积极性，比如车辆车间台车工部加工侧架一天只加工出四、五个，完不成定额，他们的思想是定额不下来就等他三个月，但在总支书记孙天福去参加劳动后，工人自觉地进行了检查，提高了认识，由五个提高到十六个。实践证明，这是一条领导和群众相结合，政治和技术相统一，又红又专的道路。
