　　Kishi Nobusuke Reaps What He Sows
    Destruction of Sino-Japanese Trade Deepens Japan's Economic Crisis
    Sharp Reduction in Industrial Production; Soaring Unemployment
    (Dispatch from Tokyo) As a result of the Kishi Nobusuke government's destruction of Sino-Japanese trade, Japan's economy, already mired in a severe crisis of overproduction, has deteriorated even more significantly.

    After Kishi Nobusuke employed double-dealing tactics to undermine Sino-Japanese trade, he smugly congratulated himself, spreading the notion that "China can't do business without Japan." He acted as if China could accomplish nothing without Japanese goods. However, Kishi Nobusuke was blind to reality and miscalculated badly. Since the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade, China's socialist construction has not only not stalled but has, on the contrary, witnessed a surging high tide of the socialist Great Leap Forward.

    In stark contrast, the Japanese economy cannot do without Sino-Japanese trade. Since Kishi Nobusuke destroyed Sino-Japanese trade, more than 180 enterprises specializing in trade with China have suffered heavy blows. According to a survey by the Japan-China Import and Export Association, the outstanding balance of unfulfilled contracts due to the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade amounts to 35 billion yen, plus the iron and steel trade negotiations, totaling 48 billion yen. In June of this year, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry admitted that due to the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade, there was even less hope for the expansion of Japan's exports. These are all direct losses. As for the indirect losses caused by Kishi Nobusuke's destruction of Sino-Japanese trade, they are even greater.

    The interruption of Sino-Japanese trade has also aggravated the decline in Japanese industrial production. The most severely affected are textile factories. Major rayon factories have reduced production by 50%, rayon staple factories by 40%, and cotton fabric factories by 30%. The iron and steel industry is no exception, with many steel manufacturers already having reduced production by 40% to 50%. The result of underutilization and reduced production is an increasingly serious situation of delayed wage payments and large-scale layoffs. The total number of workers laid off by factories in the first six months of this year was 3.7 times that of the same period last year. Nissan Chemical Industries recently laid off more than 400 employees, and other companies are also laying off workers one after another. Under these circumstances, it is even more difficult for laid-off and newly recruited workers to find employment. Although rayon companies intend to reinstate the 8,000 workers temporarily laid off last autumn, the working days and hours of many have been greatly reduced, leaving them in a state of semi-unemployment. Of the more than 79,000 middle school graduates recruited by textile companies this spring, 16,000 have yet to receive notification to report for duty. The Japanese Ministry of Labor recently predicted that the number of unemployed will increase significantly by the end of this year. Moreover, it is estimated that another 1.8 million middle school graduates will be looking for work next spring, and the unemployment phenomenon is expected to intensify dramatically.

    Under the heavy blow of the crisis of overproduction, the voices of many manufacturers in Japan's steel industry, rayon chemical industry, and textile industry condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for destroying Sino-Japanese trade are growing louder. They believe that restoring Sino-Japanese trade is the only hope for improving Japan's economic situation.

### 岸信介自作孽  破坏中日贸易后日本经济危机加深  工业生产剧烈缩减  失业人数激增

　　岸信介自作孽
    破坏中日贸易后日本经济危机加深
    工业生产剧烈缩减  失业人数激增
    本报讯  据东京消息：由于岸信介政府破坏中日贸易的结果，使已经陷于严重的生产过剩危机的日本经济更加显著地恶化起来。
    岸信介在玩弄两面三刀的手法破坏了中日贸易之后，曾经自鸣得意，并且放出空气说“中国非同日本作买卖不行”。好像中国离开日本的商品就什么也做不成似的。但是，岸信介有眼不识泰山，错打了算盘。自从中日贸易中断以来，中国的社会主义建设不仅没有停顿，相反地却出现了万马奔腾的社会主义大跃进的高潮。
    与此截然相反，日本的经济却离不了中日贸易。自从中日贸易被岸信介破坏以来，一百八十多家专门从事对华贸易的企业，受到沉重的打击。据日中输出入协会调查，由于中日贸易中断，不能履行的合同余额达三百五十亿日元，再加上钢铁贸易谈判的部分，共计达四百八十亿日元。今年6月日本通商产业省承认，由于中日贸易中断，日本的出口更加没有扩大的希望。这些都是直接的损失。至于岸信介破坏中日贸易的间接损失，就更大了。
    中日贸易的中断也加重了日本工业的减产。减产最严重的是纺织工厂。重要的人造丝工厂已减产50％，人造棉工厂减产40％，棉织品工厂减产30％。钢铁工业也不例外，许多钢铁制造商已经把生产缩减了40％到50％。开工不足和缩减生产的结果，就是工资延期支付和大规模解雇工人的情况日益严重化。今年头六个月中被工厂解雇的工人人数总共为去年同期的三点七倍。日产化学工业公司最近解雇了四百多名职工，其他公司也在纷纷解雇工人。在这种情况下，复工和新招的职工就更难就业了。人造纤维企业虽然要去年秋天暂时解雇的八千名工人复工，但是许多人的工作日和工作小时大大减少，仍处于半失业状态。纺织公司今年春天录取的七万九千多名中学毕业生中，至今有一万六千人还没有接到报到的通知。日本劳动省最近预言，失业人数到今年年底还将大大增加。而且估计明年春季又将有一百八十万中学毕业生要寻找工作，估计失业现象更会剧烈。
    在生产过剩危机的沉重打击下，日本钢铁工业、人造化学工业和纺织业的许多厂商们谴责岸信介政府破坏中日贸易的声浪，越来越高。他们认为恢复中日贸易是改善日本经济状况的唯一希望。
