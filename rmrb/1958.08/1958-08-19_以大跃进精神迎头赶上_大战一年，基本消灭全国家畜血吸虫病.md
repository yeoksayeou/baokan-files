Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 18th: The National Schistosomiasis Research Committee recently held a national symposium on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in domestic animals in Nanchang. It was proposed that at a time when a decisive victory has been achieved in eliminating schistosomiasis in humans, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in domestic animals must also be carried out under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, and closely integrating with production, catching up with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. Through a year of hard work, strive to basically eliminate schistosomiasis in domestic animals in our country.

This meeting was held under the direct guidance of the Central Committee's Nine-Member Leading Group for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis. Forty-two schistosomiasis experts, professors, animal husbandry and veterinary workers, and schistosomiasis prevention cadres from twelve provinces and cities in the national schistosomiasis epidemic areas, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, and Shanghai, participated in the meeting. At the meeting, representatives from various provinces and cities delivered speeches on the prevention and treatment experience and scientific research achievements related to schistosomiasis in domestic animals. These included Fujian's experience in organizing leadership, mobilizing the masses, and comprehensively carrying out work; Jiangxi's experience in comprehensive prevention and control measures; Hunan's experience in high-efficiency direct hatching fecal examination; and Guangdong, Shanghai, and other places' experience in short-course therapy and drug treatment. The exchange and concentration of these experiences will play a significant role in eliminating schistosomiasis in domestic animals in the future.

Investigation reports from various regions have proved that schistosomiasis is a disease common to humans and animals, and can be cross-infected through snails. If schistosomiasis in domestic animals is not eliminated, even if schistosomiasis in humans is eliminated, it still cannot be consolidated and eradicated. Therefore, the fight to eliminate schistosomiasis must be equally emphasized for both humans and animals, fighting in one go without any neglect or bias. Regarding the serious harm of schistosomiasis in domestic animals, the meeting presented a large amount of material, stating that more than thirty kinds of domestic animals and wild animals in thirteen provinces and cities in East China, Central South China, and Southwest China, as well as Taiwan Province, have been found to have schistosomiasis. It is estimated that 1.5 million head of cattle are infected nationwide. After cattle become ill, their bodies gradually become thin and their spirits are weak. Even mild infections will weaken labor by one-third. This is a huge damage to China's current agricultural production. In many areas, severe acute infections have also caused the death of cattle and sheep. At present, animal husbandry and veterinary personnel feel that they lack experience, their strength is disparate, and their burden is very heavy in the face of this arduous task. The meeting pointed out that the great achievements in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in humans in recent years have proved that as long as we are under the leadership of the Party and rely on the broad masses, all difficulties can be overcome; as long as we go deep into reality, liberate our minds, learn from the masses, and boldly create in practice, experience will be quickly enriched. We should have full confidence and determination, muster our efforts, and eliminate schistosomiasis in domestic animals in our country as soon as possible.

The meeting finally put forward four requirements for the current prevention and control of schistosomiasis in domestic animals: 1. The general principle and task of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis in domestic animals should be to implement the principle of "active prevention and comprehensive measures," focusing on cattle, working hard for one year, and finishing the work in the autumn of next year. By using the method of repeated assaults, ensure that schistosomiasis in domestic animals is eliminated as quickly as possible. 2. In terms of prevention and treatment measures, the meeting exchanged many experiences, and various regions can boldly try and create boldly according to specific conditions. In terms of investigation methods, it is required to be more, faster, and more accurate; in terms of treatment methods, it is required to be more, faster, safer, and more effective, and easy to implement and master by the masses. 3. In terms of scientific research, it is necessary to combine theory with practice and implement the principle of serving the prevention and control work. In practice, we must continuously summarize better and more advanced experiences from the four aspects of treatment, diagnosis, prevention, and epidemiology in order to promote the development of the entire prevention and control work of schistosomiasis in domestic animals. 4. When carrying out prevention and control work, all regions must organize forces, comprehensively plan, and make specific arrangements under the unified leadership of the Party committee, rely on the masses, and combine prevention and control work with production.

　　以大跃进精神迎头赶上
　　大战一年，基本消灭全国家畜血吸虫病
    新华社南昌18日电　全国血吸虫病研究委员会最近在南昌召开全国防治家畜血吸虫病座谈会，提出在目前消灭人的血吸虫病已经取得决定性胜利的时候，家畜血吸虫病的防治工作也必须在党的领导下、依靠群众、紧密结合生产，以大跃进的精神迎头赶上，苦战一年，争取基本上消灭我国家畜的血吸虫病。
    这次会议是在中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组直接指导下召开的。参加会议的有全国血吸虫病流行区的江苏、浙江、江西、福建、四川、上海等十二个省市的血吸虫病专家、教授、畜牧兽医工作者和血防干部四十二人。会上各省市代表分别就有关家畜血吸虫病的预防治疗经验和科学研究成果发了言。如福建的组织领导、发动群众、全面开展工作的经验，江西的综合措施的防治经验，湖南的高功效直接孵化粪检经验，广东、上海等地短程疗法和药物治疗方面的经验。这些经验的交流和集中，将对今后消灭家畜血吸虫病有重大作用。
    各地的调查报告证明，血吸虫病是人畜共患的疾病，通过钉螺可以交叉感染，如果家畜血吸虫病不消灭，人的血吸虫病虽然消灭了，但仍不能巩固和根绝，因此消灭血吸虫病的斗争，必须是人畜同时并重，一鼓而战，不能有任何忽视和偏废。关于家畜血吸虫病的严重危害性，会上提出了大量材料说明，我国已经发现华东、中南、西南地区的十三个省市和台湾省有三十几种家畜和野生动物有血吸虫病，仅耕牛患血吸虫病的全国估计就有一百五十万头。牛染病后，身体逐渐瘦削，精神萎靡，轻度感染都要减弱劳力三分之一。这对我国当前农业生产来说是一项巨大的损害。不少地区由于严重的急性感染，还造成牛羊的死亡。目前畜牧兽医人员在这艰巨任务面前感到经验不足，力量悬殊，负担很重。会议指出，几年来人的血吸虫病防治工作的伟大成就证明，只要我们在党的领导下，依靠广大群众，一切困难都是能克服的；只要我们深入实际，解放思想，向群众学习和到实践中去大胆创造，经验是会很快丰富起来的。我们应该有充分的信心和决心，鼓起干劲，尽快地把我国家畜血吸虫病消灭光。
    会议最后对当前防治家畜血吸虫病的工作提出了四点要求：一、防治家畜血吸虫病的总方针、任务，应当是贯彻“积极防治，综合措施”的方针，以耕牛为重点，苦战一年，明年秋天扫尾，用反复突击的方法，保证最快地把家畜血吸虫病消灭光。二、在预防治疗措施上，会议交流了许多经验，各地可根据具体条件，大胆试用，大胆独创。在调查方法上要求做到多、快、正确；治疗方法上要求做到多、快、安全、有效，而且简便易行，能为群众掌握。三、在科学研究方面，要结合实际，贯彻研究工作为防治工作服务的方针，在实践中不断从治疗、诊断、预防、流行病学四个方面总结出更好更先进的经验来，以推动整个家畜血吸虫病防治工作的发展。四、进行防治工作时，各地必须在党委的统一领导下，组织力量，全面规划，具体安排，依靠群众，做到防治工作和生产相结合。
