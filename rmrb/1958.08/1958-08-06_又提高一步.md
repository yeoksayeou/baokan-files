　　On-site meetings are universally recognized as the best type of meeting and also an excellent leadership method. In the past six months, many localities and departments have adopted the on-site meeting approach to exchange work experiences and disseminate advanced technologies, achieving tremendous results. Many difficult problems, once viewed on the actual site, are quickly resolved.

　　Currently, the on-site meetings people are accustomed to involve selecting advanced models, learning from advanced practices, and catching up to advanced levels. However, in actual work, there are not only advanced sites but also relatively backward sites. Under the same conditions, grasping both the advanced and the backward ends for comparison makes on-site meetings even more rich and diverse.

　　The Gansu inspection team's attention to establishing opposing examples in on-site meetings integrates the leadership method of grasping both ends to drive the middle with the on-site meeting approach. In this way, the leadership method of on-site meetings has taken another step forward.

    又提高一步
    现场会议是大家一致公认的最好的一种会议方式，也是很好的领导方法。近半年来，许多地方和许多部门采用现场会议的方式，交流工作经验，传播先进技术，获得巨大的成果。许多难以解决的问题，到实际现场一看，很快就解决了。
    现在，大家习惯的现场会议，都是选择先进的典型，学习先进的作法，赶上先进的水平。但是，实际工作中，不仅有先进的现场，也有比较落后的现场，在相同条件下，既抓住先进的一端，又抓住落后的一端，进行比较，这就使现场会议更加丰富多彩。
    甘肃检查团注意到在现场会上树立对立面，这就把抓两头带中间的领导方法同现场会议方式融结在一起。这样，现场会议的领导方法又提高了一步。
