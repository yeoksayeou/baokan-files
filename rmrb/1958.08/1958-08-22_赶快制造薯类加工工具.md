　　Sweet Potato Roasting Room
　　This sweet potato roasting room was created by Liu Zijing, the first secretary of the Wanxian County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan, after more than three months of research and with the help of the masses.

    The structure of this sweet potato roasting room is simple, and all raw materials can be supplied by the agricultural cooperatives themselves. Its main advantages are that all the heat can be contained within the roasting room; the temperature is consistent from top to bottom, and it can be dried in five layers at a time; it is easy to light the fire, the smoke path is clear and unobstructed, accidents are unlikely to occur, and the temperature can reach above 70 degrees Celsius, so things dry quickly, steam is unimpeded, and there is no condensation in the room. Each roasting room, 14 square meters wide and 3 meters high, can roast more than 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per day. It can not only roast sweet potatoes, but also roast all kinds of grains.

    Wanxian plans to build five to six thousand of these roasting rooms throughout the county this year, so that every sweet potato is dried and none are left to rot.

　　Qingyuan Rapid Horse-Drawn Slicing Machine
　　The rapid horse-drawn slicing machine was created in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province. The structure of this slicing machine is: a small car frame, a disc installed in the center of the frame with six toothed knives, six small hoppers above the knives, and two gears used on old waterwheels installed under the car. When slicing, the horse pulls the cart forward, and the gears drive the wooden disc to rotate and cut slices. The potato slices fall out as they are cut, and are evenly spread on the drying ground.

    Preliminary tests show that this slicing machine can slice 15,000 jin per hour. If it operates continuously day and night, it can process 360,000 jin per day. The efficiency of each slicing machine is equivalent to the manual labor of 350 people. Although this slicing machine is highly efficient, the cost is very low, requiring only 28 workdays and 10 yuan per machine. This new slicing tool was successfully developed by Feng Yanwu and four others from the Qingyuan County Timber Cooperative after three days and nights of hard work on August 12. (Wang Jintai, et al.)

　　Pingjiang Slicing and Shredding Machine
　　The Pingjiang slicing and shredding machine is mainly used for slicing and shredding sweet potatoes and radishes. It has the following advantages: 1. The structure is simple, flexible, sturdy and durable, and it is not easy to break down; 2. It is easy to operate, especially since it can be operated while sitting down, so men, women, old and young can use it; 3. It is highly efficient, capable of shredding or slicing about 800 jin per hour, which is 12 to 18 times faster than manual labor; 4. The quality is good, and the shredded material is uniform in thickness; 5. The machine uses wood for all parts except the crankshaft, so the production cost is low, only about 26 yuan per machine.

    This slicing and shredding machine is 950 millimeters high and 1,800 millimeters long; two people can carry it. The whole machine is divided into three parts: the shredding (slicing) part, the transmission mechanism, and the frame.

    This slicing and shredding machine is produced by the Pingjiang Chengguan Town Woodworking Cooperative in Hunan. It was well received at the Hunan Provincial Agricultural and Sideline Machinery Exhibition, and several improvement suggestions were obtained at the same time. (Attached picture)

　　赶快制造薯类加工工具
　　甘薯炕房
　　这是中共四川万县县委第一书记刘子敬经过三个多月的钻研和在群众的帮助下，创造的一种红苕（即甘薯）炕房。
    这种红苕炕房的构造简单，一切原料都可以由农业社自给。它的主要优点是热量可以全部拥进炕房；热度上下一致，分列五层可以一次炕干；生火容易，烟路疏畅，不易出事故，温度可达摄氏七十度以上，烤的东西干得快，蒸汽不受阻拦，室内不流汽水。每座十四平方公尺宽、三公尺高的炕房，每天可炕红苕一万多斤。它不但能炕红苕，而且能炕各种粮食。
    万县今年将在全县修建这种炕房五千到六千座，做到苕干有炕，不烂一斤。
　　清苑快速马拉切片机
　　快速马拉切片机是河北省清苑县创造的。这部切片机的结构是：一个小车架子、一个安装在车架中央的圆盘，盘上有六个齿刀，刀上有六个小斗，车下装有旧水车上用过的两个齿轮。切片的时候，马拉车向前走，齿轮带动木盘旋转就能切出片来，薯片随切随落，均匀的铺在晒场上。
    这部切片机经初步试用每小时可切片一万五千斤，每天日夜不停的进行，就可以加工三十六万斤。每部切片机的效率和三百五十个劳力手工操作效率相等。这部切片机效率虽高，但成本很低，每部只用工二十八个，费用十元。这部新的切片工具是清苑县木业社冯彦武等五个人苦战三昼夜，在8月12日试制成功的。  （王金台等）
　　平江切丝切片机
　　平江切丝切片机主要用于甘薯、萝卜的切片、切丝。它有以下这些优点：1．构造简便灵活，坚固耐用，不容易发生毛病；2．操作容易，特别是能坐着操作，男女老幼都能使用；3．效率高，每小时能刨丝、切片八百斤左右，比手工快十二倍到十八倍；4．质量好，切出来的丝粗细均匀；5．机器除曲轴外，都用木材，因此制作成本低，每部只要二十六元左右。
    这种切丝切片机高九百五十公厘，长一千八百公厘；两个人可以抬动。全机分三大部分：刨丝（切片）部分，传动机构和机架。
    这种切丝切片机是湖南平江城关镇木器社制作的。它在湖南省农副业机器展览会上受到好评，同时征得几项改进意见。（附图片）
