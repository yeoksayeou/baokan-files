　　Ode to the Xushui People's Commune
　　1. The Commune of Universal Military Service
　　Special Correspondent of This Newspaper: Kang Zhuo
    It has only been half a month since Chairman Mao inspected Xushui; I find it very difficult to sing the praises of the people's commune here. This county realized water conservancy in the bitter battles of last winter and this spring, especially on the basis of the bumper wheat harvest in June this year, and began to establish people's communes. After Chairman Mao's inspection in early August, all the county's two hundred or so agricultural cooperatives were quickly built into communes. In mid-August, many small communes merged one after another; some of the county's twenty townships were merged into one township and one commune, and some were one township and two or three communes. Now, the whole county has been merged into seven large people's communes—that is, seven townships; each commune has about nine thousand households and forty to fifty thousand people. The problem is that this kind of change at a rate of a thousand miles a day is by no means a simple increase or decrease in numbers, but has infinite significance. But I can't write even a fraction of this infinite significance...
    Gun Distribution Ceremony
    Perhaps we can start with militarization. Because Chairman Mao once encouraged the militarization measures of universal military service here, and praised the improvement of labor efficiency and the development of production leap forward after the implementation of militarization here, the state decided to issue guns to the members of the people's commune with universal military service here, and first held the gun distribution ceremony in Nanliyuan Township, where Chairman Mao had visited, on August 13. This gun distribution ceremony fully demonstrated the superiority of the integration of people's commune members and militiamen.
    This was a meeting of more than a thousand commune members and steel militiamen. Handguns were issued to the company commanders and rifles to the soldiers. Of course, it was impossible to achieve one gun per person for the time being. However, regardless of whether they got a gun or not, they all felt a special sense of glory and excitement. On this day, more than four hundred female soldiers were dressed particularly beautifully, mostly in pink-bottomed red flowers or white-bottomed blue flower jackets; they never considered the oil stains on the guns. Zheng Xiuling, who got the gun, felt that her braid was hindering the operation, so she cut off her braid immediately. More than six hundred male soldiers were all smiles, and if they found any dirt on any of the guns, they would grab the snow-white towels to wipe them. The day after the gun distribution, in Dasigezhuang, where Chairman Mao had visited, I saw the militiamen practicing vigorously in the morning before work and in the evening after work; during production, they put their guns on the edge of the field, and the male soldiers even shouted "one two three four" while working. And what best shows the power of militarization is that after the gun distribution ceremony, 1,100 soldiers, according to orders, carried hoes on their shoulders and guns in their hands, and ran to the production battlefield, hoeing 410 mu of land, weeding 340 mu, and topdressing 95 mu in two and a half hours; people were still singing "Liberation Army War Song" during the rush production!
    All these soldiers who carry guns and those who have not yet carried guns, men from sixteen to thirty years old, and women from seventeen to twenty-two years old, are all activists who have been strictly selected on the basis of being both red and expert. They are called basic militiamen. Except when they are concentrated for training and temporary rush tasks, they are usually organized together with the people's commune members of universal military service, and each militia platoon has a backbone squad. That is to say, each company can concentrate a backbone platoon, and each battalion can concentrate a backbone company. The backbone militiamen use their assault actions to promote the combat-oriented production leap forward of all commune members.
    Production Combat-Oriented
    It is this combat-oriented production leap forward that shows the great effect of the large-scale labor cooperation of the people's commune. A few days ago, some of the fields had weeds and insects; any small cooperative, even if it tried its best to weed and eliminate insects, would find it difficult to complete the task, not to mention that it would also delay other work. However, due to the commune's unified allocation of labor and militarized actions, the communes with more weeds concentrated thousands of people to weed with all their strength, and the weeds in the fields of Chengguan Town were all weeded out by concentrating two thousand people in one day. The forty-mile highway from Chengguan to Dawangdian was almost impassable due to rain erosion and iron wheel rolling; and the entire militia of the two large communes on both sides of the highway only worked together for more than a day, but now it is flat at a glance, buses have been opened to traffic, and the iron ore mined in the mountains near Dawangdian has also been smoothly transported directly to the city. Yesterday, in Xiefang of Suicheng Commune, I saw that there were only a few groups of people working in such a large village, one group was women, carrying sprayers on their shoulders and holding spray pipes in their hands, spraying growth hormone in the multi-spiked cornfields; the other group, both men and women, were topdressing in the yam fields. What did the people in their village do? Their four companies were uniformly transferred by the commune and the military headquarters to carry out a rush to accumulate fertilizer. This is truly a fertilizer accumulation battle of a field army! This year, each mu of wheat field must be applied with 150,000 catties of coarse fertilizer, as the Suicheng Commune Party Committee said, if you don't fight such a large-scale battle, no matter how much you leap forward, you can't produce so much fertilizer!
    Militarization Adapts to Production Needs
    The people's commune and the military organization are so integrated. From the development process, militarization was the precursor to the establishment of the people's commune here, and the people's commune further improved militarization. As early as last winter and this spring during water conservancy construction, this was a large-scale battle with unified allocation of labor throughout the county. The elimination of the four pests was also carried out in this way. After the wheat harvest this year, the county had to plant 260,000 mu of yam, and had to do its best to fight drought, and all 110,000 laborers were divided into 40,000 to engage in industry, dig machine wells, and help other counties build reservoirs; at that time, there were 60,000 cultivated areas in the county, with only one or two laborers per area plus a few old and weak people who were not considered laborers! It was simply impossible to do anything. Zhang Guozhong, the first secretary of the county party committee, rode his bicycle around for three days, encountering countless difficulties, and also encountering some agricultural cooperatives that had started labor cooperation on their own, started assault companies and professional platoons, and also started leveling graves, eating in canteens, running kindergartens, and dismantling old houses to use the soil for land and temporary unified allocation of housing. Therefore, the county launched a mass debate on labor cooperation, and then implemented militarization and combat-oriented production for all people.
    This is the situation that forces people. But this is still a preliminary form. The agricultural cooperatives are too small, and no matter how much cooperation and combat assault, the improvement of efficiency is limited. What's more, the farmland all requires artistic pattern-style gardening and standardization, and the land and labor between cooperatives and townships urgently need to be unified. Therefore, another situation forces people: it is necessary to merge large cooperatives and establish communes. Once the people's commune is established, the large-scale transfer of troops becomes frequent, and problems arise with the military organization's companies, platoons and squads - you can't always transfer men and women aged forty or fifty in the military organization at any time. Therefore, on the basis of ordinary commune member militias, a flexible and combat-strong backbone militia organization was established, which improved militarization a step further. But why must guns be issued?
    "Defend peace!" Yan Chunming of Dasigezhuang said, "If the American and British imperialists don't get out of the Middle East quickly, I will carry a gun and compete with them!"
    Yan Zhenjiang, a model breeder from Dasigezhuang, also added a benefit of militarization. This is a sixty-year-old man, a martial arts master, who can perform steel forks and three-section staffs that everyone praises. He has never been sick in his life, and now he can carry two rounds of manure in the time it takes others to carry one round. He said:
    "It's good for young people to practice martial arts! Production is sure to leap forward faster!"
    In the past wars, the people of Xushui were famous for their guerrilla warfare and tunnel warfare, and the combat production at that time was also very good; people who lived in the old liberated areas at that time probably still remember the miracle created by Zhang Rui Production Cooperative in Xushui County during the war. Now, in the organization of the people's commune, the traditional combat labor of the people of Xushui will naturally push the great leap forward of production here to an infinitely beautiful future.

　　徐水人民公社颂
　　一、全民皆兵的公社
　　本报特约记者　康濯
    自从毛主席到徐水视察以后，才不过半月天气；我想要歌颂这里的人民公社，却感到困难很多。这个县是在去冬今春的苦战中实现了水利化，特别是在今年6月麦季丰收的基础上，开始建立人民公社的。8月初，毛主席视察以后，全县二百多个农业社很快就全部建成了公社。8月半，不少小公社纷纷合并；全县二十个乡，有的并成了一乡一社，有的是一乡两社、三社。现在，全县却并成了七个大的人民公社——也就是七个乡；每个公社九千户左右，四五万人口。问题是这种一日千里的变化，还决不只是单纯的数字增减，而是意义无穷。但我却写不出这无穷的意义于万一……
    发枪典礼
    也许可以从军事化谈起。由于毛主席曾经鼓励了这里全民皆兵的军事化措施，赞美了这里实行军事化以后劳动效率的提高和生产跃进的发展，因而国家决定给这里全民皆兵的公社社员发枪，并于8月13日首先在毛主席到过的南梨园乡举行了发枪典礼。这个发枪典礼就充分显示了人民公社社员和民兵结成一体的优越性。
    这是一个一千多公社社员和钢铁民兵的大会。给连长发手枪，战士发步枪。一时间当然不可能做到一人一枪。但是，不管得没得到枪，都同样感到特殊的光荣和兴奋。这一天，四百多个女战士都穿的格外漂亮，大多是粉底红花或白地兰花的小褂；她们都决不考虑枪枝的油污。得到了枪的郑秀龄嫌自己的辫子妨碍操作，马上就剪掉了辫子。六百多男战士更是个个喜笑颜开，发现哪一支枪上有脏土痕迹，大家就抢着抓下雪白的头巾去擦。在发枪以后的第二天，我在毛主席到过的大寺各庄，看见民兵们在早上上工以前和晚上下工以后，都雄赳赳地操练一遍；在生产的时候，把枪架在地边，男战士们甚至做着活儿还要喊“一二三四”。而最能显示军事化的威力的，还是在发枪典礼以后，一千一百名战士根据命令，肩扛锄头手持枪，跑步奔赴生产战场，两个半钟头就锄地四百一十亩，拔草三百四十亩，追肥九十五亩；人们在突击生产的时候，都还唱着“解放军战歌”呢！
    所有这些背枪的和暂时还没有背枪的战士，男的从十六岁到三十岁，女的从十七到二十二，一个个都是在红专条件上经过严格挑选的积极分子。他们叫基本民兵。他们除开操练的时候和担负临时突击任务的时候集中活动以外，平时都和全民皆兵的公社社员编制在一起，每一个民兵排有一个基干班。这就是说，每一个连都能集中一个基干排，每一个营都能集中一个基干连。基干民兵们以自己的突击行为，推动着全体公社社员的战斗化的生产跃进。
    生产战斗化
    正是这种战斗化的生产跃进，显示了人民公社的劳动大协作的巨大效果。前几天，部分地里有草、有虫；任何一个小社，就是全力锄草和除虫都很难完成任务，更不用说还得耽误其它活儿。但由于公社统一调配劳力和军事化的行动，草多的公社就集中几千人全力锄草，城关镇地里的草就这样在一天之内集中两千人全部锄光。从城关去大王店的四十里公路，由于雨水冲刷和铁轮车碾压，闹得寸步难行；而公路两旁两个大公社的全体民兵，只集中干了一天多，现在却一望展平，公共汽车已经通车，大王店附近山里开采的铁矿石也已顺利地直往城里运。昨天，我在遂城公社的谢坊，看到那么一个大村子只有不多的两伙人在干活，一伙是妇女，肩上背着喷雾器，手里拿着喷管，在多穗玉米地里喷生长素；另一伙男女都有，在山药地里追肥。他们村的人都干什么去了？他们有四个连由公社和军事指挥部统一调去在突击积肥。这真是野战兵团的积肥大战！今年的麦地每亩要施粗肥十五万斤，正如遂城公社党委会说的，若不这么大兵团作战，你再怎么跃进，也变不出那么些肥料啊！
    军事化同生产需要相适应
    人民公社和军事组织就这么结成了一体。从发展过程来看，军事化是这里建立人民公社的先声，而人民公社又进一步提高了军事化。早在去冬今春水利建设的时候，这里就是全县劳力统一调配的大兵团作战。除四害也是采用这种方式。今年麦收以后，全县要栽二十六万亩山药，要全力抗旱，而全部十一万劳力又还分出了四万人去搞工业、打机井和帮助外县修水库；当时全县六万个耕作区，每区不过个把劳力外加几个不算劳力的老弱！简直是什么也干不成。县委第一书记张国忠骑着自行车，在各处转了三天，碰见了数不清的困难，也碰见了一些农业社自己搞开了劳动协作，搞开了突击连和专业排，也搞开了平坟堆、吃食堂、办幼儿园以及拆旧房土上地和临时性的统一分配住处。于是，全县发动了劳动大协作的鸣放辩论，接着就实行了全民皆兵的军事化和战斗化。
    这是形势逼人。但这也还是初级的形式。农业社太小，任怎么协作和战斗突击，提高效率也有限。何况庄稼地都要求美术图案式的园田化和规格化，社社乡乡之间的土地和劳力都迫切需要统一安排。于是，又一个形势逼人：必须并大社、办公社。而人民公社一办，大兵团调动一频繁，全民皆兵的营连排又发生了问题——你总不能把军事组织里四五十岁往上的男女随时调来调去。于是，又在一般社员民兵的基础上，成立了机动灵活而战斗顽强的基干民兵组织，把军事化提高了一步。但是，为什么一定要发枪？
    “保卫和平！”大寺各庄的阎春明说：“美英帝国主义若不赶快滚出中东，我就要挎上枪跟它较量较量！”
    大寺各庄的模范饲养员阎振江还补充了一条军事化的好处。这是一个六十岁的老汉，武术家，钢叉和三节棍耍的人人叫好。他一辈子没闹过病，现在别人起一圈粪的工夫他还能起两圈。他说：
    “青年们下操练武的，好啊！生产准能跃进的更快啦！”
    徐水人民在过去的战争里面，曾以游击战和地道战闻名，而当时的战斗生产也闹的挺好；在当时的老解放区生活过的人们，大概还会记得战争中徐水县张瑞生产合作社所创造的奇迹。现在，在人民公社的组织里，徐水人的传统相承的战斗劳动，自然更会把这儿的生产大跃进推向永无止境的美好前程。
