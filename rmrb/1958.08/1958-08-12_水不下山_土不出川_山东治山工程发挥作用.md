Water Doesn't Run Down the Mountains, Soil Doesn't Leave the Rivers
Shandong's Mountain Management Projects Take Effect

Shandong Province's mountain management projects have withstood their first major rain test, proving their enormous power. They have contained floods, reduced runoff, and created favorable conditions for future drought resistance.

Since the beginning of the flood season, mountainous areas of Shandong Province, with the exception of Laiyang Prefecture, have experienced widespread heavy rainfall, averaging over 220 millimeters; the maximum daily rainfall reached 400 millimeters. The characteristics of this rainfall were high volume, sudden onset, and concentrated precipitation. However, thanks to the role played by various mountain management projects, although the rain was heavy, the water wasn't excessive, and although the rain was rapid, the water wasn't turbulent, basically achieving the requirement of "water doesn't run down the mountains, soil doesn't leave the rivers."

From last winter to before the arrival of this year's flood season, under the inspiration of the Party's General Line, the people in the mountainous areas of Shandong Province vigorously engaged in mountain management projects, completing 5.23 million mu of fish-scale pits and contour terraces, 9.27 million mu of terraced fields with ditches, more than 680 check dams, over 3,500 reservoirs, 10,000 water cellars, and nearly 80,000 small reservoirs and ponds. According to preliminary estimates, these mountain management projects can store approximately 3.7 billion cubic meters of water, accounting for 44% of the total runoff in mountainous areas.

The benefits of the mountain management projects have further encouraged the enthusiasm of the people in the mountainous areas for mountain management. Now, various localities are organizing forces to continue vigorously carrying out mountain management projects during the flood season, thoroughly shaking off the label of "poor mountains and evil waters."

　　水不下山　土不出川
　　山东治山工程发挥作用
    山东省治山工程经过首次大雨考验，证明威力巨大。拦蓄了洪水，减少了径流，又为今后抗旱创造了有利条件。
    入汛以来，山东省山陵地区，除莱阳专区外，都普降大雨，平均降雨量在二百二十公厘以上；最大日雨量达到四百公厘。这次降雨的特点是雨量大、来势猛、降雨集中。但由于各项治山工程发挥了作用，雨虽大，而水不大，雨虽急，而水不急，基本上达到了“水不下山，土不出川”的要求。
    从去冬到今年汛期到来之前，山东省山区人民在党的总路线的鼓舞下，大搞治山工程，共完成鱼鳞坑、水平沟整地五百二十三万亩，修渠梯田九百二十七万亩，闸谷坊六百八十余座，修蓄水池三千五百余个，挖水窖一万个，修水库塘坝近八万个。据初步计算，这些治山工程约可蓄水三十七亿方，占山区总径流量的44％。
    治山工程的效益，更加鼓舞了山区群众的治山积极性。现在各地正在组织力量，在汛期继续大搞治山工程，彻底摘掉“穷山恶水”的帽子。　（摘自大众日报）
