    Beijing, August 7th (By Our Reporter) China's newly opened air route between Beijing and Qingdao successfully completed its trial flight on the 5th and is expected to officially open around the 10th. From now on, the journey between Qingdao, the nation's sanatorium resort, and the capital, as well as major cities across the country, will be greatly shortened.
    At noon on the 5th, the Civil Aviation Administration of China's Ilyushin Il-14 airliner flew over Qingdao for the first time, landing smoothly at Qingdao Airport. It had taken off from Beijing that morning, with a stopover in Jinan; the entire journey of over 730 kilometers took two and a half hours. On the morning of the 6th, the plane safely returned directly to Beijing.
    Once this route is open, it will take about three hours to travel from Beijing to Qingdao, compared to seventeen hours by express train. The fare for this air route is about the same as a soft-sleeper berth on the train.

    北京青岛新辟航线
    本报青岛7日电  我国新开辟的北京——青岛航线在5日试航成功，10日前后即可正式通航。从此，祖国的疗养胜地——青岛，与首都及全国各大城市之间的行程就大大缩短了。
    5日中午，中国民用航空局的伊尔十四型客机第一次飞到青岛上空，平稳地降落在青岛机场，它是当天上午从北京起飞的，中途曾在济南降落；全程七百三十多公里，共飞行两小时半。6日上午，飞机又安然直返北京。
    这条航线开辟以后，从北京到青岛三小时左右就可以到达，乘快车需十七个小时。这条航线的票价与火车软席卧铺差不多。
