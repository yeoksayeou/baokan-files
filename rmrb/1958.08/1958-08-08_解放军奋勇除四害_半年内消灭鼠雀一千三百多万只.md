    PLA Bravely Eliminates the Four Pests
    Over 13 Million Rats and Sparrows Destroyed in Half a Year
    (Our dispatch) Through the Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene Campaign, the PLA's sanitary conditions have taken on a completely new look, with over 13 million rats and sparrows destroyed in half a year.
    This year, all units have included the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign in their leap forward plans. Leading cadres at all levels have taken personal command, mobilizing the broad masses of soldiers and local people to jointly and thoroughly eliminate the four pests. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year, a total of 8,580,000 rats were eliminated and 4,740,000 sparrows were killed. Many units have eliminated mosquitoes, flies, mosquito larvae, fly pupae, cockroaches, and sandflies, and filled in depressions, sewage pits, and dredged ditches, thoroughly eradicating the breeding grounds of the four pests. With the determination to "leave sparrows with no way to fly to the sky, rats with no way to burrow into the ground, and mosquitoes and flies without descendants," the barracks of all units are "weeding out grass by the roots, sweeping away all garbage, filling in muddy depressions early, greening the earthen hills everywhere, preventing dust from rising in the wind, brightening the interior on all six sides, and transforming barren mountains."

    半年内消灭鼠雀一千三百多万只
    本报讯  经过除四害讲卫生运动，解放军的卫生面貌焕然一新，半年内消灭鼠雀一千三百多万只。
    各部队今年都把爱国卫生运动列入跃进规划，各级领导干部亲自挂帅，发动广大战士和当地人民一起痛歼四害。据不完全统计，今年上半年共消灭老鼠八百五十八万只，打死麻雀四百七十四万只，许多单位消灭了蚊蝇、孑孓、蝇蛹、蟑螂和白蛉，并填平了洼地、污水坑、疏通了沟渠，彻底铲除了四害孳生繁殖的场地。在“让麻雀上天无路，老鼠入地无门，蚊蝇断子绝孙”的决心下，各部队的营房都是“杂草连根拔，垃圾一扫光，泥洼早填平，土山遍绿化，刮风不起土，室内六面光，荒山变了样”。
