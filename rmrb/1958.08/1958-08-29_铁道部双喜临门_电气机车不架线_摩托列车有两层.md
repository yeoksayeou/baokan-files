Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 28th - China's first electric locomotive without overhead wires successfully completed its trial run in Changchun on the 26th. This pioneering achievement opens up a new path for the electrification of railway transportation in our country.

This electric locomotive does not require overhead wires or a complete set of electrical equipment such as substations and distribution stations along the route. It is equipped with storage batteries, and the electricity generated by the onboard generator is stored in the batteries to meet the needs of the locomotive's operation at any time. Preliminary tests show that this locomotive can pull 700 tons and travel at 60 kilometers per hour, with good operational performance.

This type of electric locomotive has incomparable advantages over other locomotives. It can save 200,000 yuan in construction investment and 4 tons of copper wire per kilometer compared to electric locomotives with overhead wires; it does not require the large amount of coal needed for steam locomotives; locomotive maintenance costs can be reduced by 77.8%, manpower reduced by 40%, and the labor intensity of locomotive crews can be greatly reduced.

This electric locomotive without overhead wires was researched and trial-produced by Zhao Yu, the head of the Changchun Railway Electrical Affairs Section, and 21 technicians and veteran workers from the Electrical Affairs Section, based on Zhao Yu's initiative. The Ministry of Railways and many fraternal units also actively provided support and encouragement. Starting from July 9th, without any materials or drawings for reference, they successfully trial-produced the electric locomotive that does not require overhead wires after a month and a half of experimentation.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 28th - China's first set of diesel motor double-decker trains was successfully manufactured at the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory on the 27th. Trial runs have proven that the train's operation and speed fully meet the design requirements.

The successful manufacture of this type of train marks a leap in our country's locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing technology.

This motor train consists of two 600-horsepower diesel locomotives and four double-decker passenger cars. It uses many new technologies, and driving is completely instrument-controlled.

The passenger cars in the train set are divided into two levels, with each carriage accommodating 196 passengers and a structural speed of 120 kilometers per hour. The train is equipped with good ventilation and insulation equipment, and the seats are comfortable.

　　铁道部双喜临门
    电气机车不架线　摩托列车有两层
    据新华社长春28日电  我国第一台无架空线的电气机车26日在长春试车成功。这一创举为我国实现铁路运输电气化开辟了新的道路。
    这台电气机车，不需要架空电线和沿途各站、段附设变电所、配电所等一套电气设备。它装有蓄电池，车上发电机发出的电力蓄存在电池里，随时满足机车运行的需要。据初步试验，这台机车牵引七百吨，每小时行驶六十公里，运行状况良好。
    这种电气机车有着其它机车不可比拟的优点。它比有架空线电气机车每公里可节省二十万元建设投资和四吨紫铜丝；不需要蒸汽机车的大量燃煤；机车维修费可以降低77.8％，人力减少40％，而且还能大大减轻机务人员的劳动强度。　　这台无架空线电气机车是根据长春铁路电务段段长赵宇的创议，由赵宇和电务段二十一名技术人员、老工人研究试制成功的，铁道部和许多兄弟单位也积极给以支援和鼓励。从7月9日开始，在没有资料、图纸可作参考和依据的情况下，经过一个半月的试验，他们就把不用架空线的电气机车试制成功了。
    新华社青岛28日电　我国第一组柴油摩托双层列车27日在四方机车车辆制造厂制造成功。试车结果，证明列车的运转和行驶速度等方面完全达到设计要求。
    这种列车的制造成功，标志着我国机车车辆制造技术有了飞跃的发展。
    这种摩托列车是由两台各六百匹马力的内燃机车和四辆双层客车组成的，它采用了许多新的技术，驾驶完全采用仪表控制。
    列车组的客车分为两层，每一车厢可乘旅客一百九十六人，构造速度为每小时一百二十公里。列车上装有良好的通风和保温设备，坐位舒适。
