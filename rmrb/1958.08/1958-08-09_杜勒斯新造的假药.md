Dulles' Newly Invented Fake Medicine
    Jia Yanzhen

Just when the aggressors were concentrating on their Middle East aggression, they suddenly discovered that Latin America was becoming restless. So, they were eager to find a new medicine to anesthetize the awakened people. For this purpose, Dulles concocted a new anesthetic and went to Latin America to peddle it. According to the Associated Press, on August 5th in Brazil, he shouted about "atheistic, materialistic, and aggressive forces…dominating the world." He described the American aggression against some countries in the Middle East and Latin America as if it were to "try to stop" this domination.

Dulles has his own plans. He believes that there are many people in the Middle East and Latin America who believe in "God." As long as he mixes the "atheism," "materialism," and "aggressive forces" drugs with saliva and makes them swallow it, he can anesthetize their awareness of striving for national independence. Thus, they will be at Dulles's disposal to oppose "atheism," "materialism," and "aggressive forces."

However, the ignorant era when quacks sold fake medicine to make money and harm people is over. Despite Dulles's vigorous mixing and the golden label of "essential medicine, one dose cures," people cannot help but consider: are atheism, materialism, and aggressive forces really necessarily connected?

If that were the case, then why did Eisenhower, who claims to be a follower of God, order American troops to Arab countries and still refuses to order them to withdraw? In his speech to the invading Lebanese soldiers, didn't Eisenhower shout "God bless you"? Before the invading American troops set sail for Lebanon, didn't they also kneel on the ground to pray to God, and didn't the pastors bless them? Is it just because they made the sign of the cross, so killing people can be considered saving the world for God, and arson and robbery can be regarded as acting on behalf of heaven?

Of course, theists and idealists are not all aggressors, but it is always true that those who are carrying out aggression in the Middle East and colonial oppression in Latin America are not atheists and materialists. On the contrary, those who stand at the forefront of defending world peace are atheists and dialectical materialists. The two giants who jointly issued the communique of "resolutely supporting the national independence movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America" are also thorough atheists and materialists. Selling fake medicine is useless. Even if God is brought in to shield the aggressors, this truth cannot be concealed. All people who believe in God and those who do not, as long as they resist aggression and love peace, should unite and severely strike at the aggressors.

Dulles's fake medicine cannot confuse the true nature of oppressed people striving for independence and liberation. We are waiting to see how this quack who sells fake medicine will lose his capital!

    杜勒斯新造的假药
    贾彦祯
    正当侵略者聚精会神的从事中东侵略时，忽然发现拉丁美洲很不安静，于是便急于找一种新药来麻醉一下清醒过来的人们。为了这，杜勒斯新配了一付麻醉剂，跑到拉丁美洲去兜售了。据美联社报道，8月5日他在巴西大叫“无神论的、唯物主义的和侵略的力量……统治全世界。”他把美国对中东和拉丁美洲一些国家的侵略，说成好像就是为了“设法制止”这种统治。
    杜勒斯有自己的打算，他以为中东和拉丁美洲信“神”的人多，只要把“无神论”、“唯物主义”和“侵略力量”几味药，用唾沫拌和起来，让他们吞服下去，就可以麻醉了他们争取民族独立的意识，而一任杜勒斯摆布他们去反对“无神论”、“唯物主义”和“侵略力量”了。
    然而，任凭江湖骗子们卖假药谋财害命的愚昧时代过去了。尽管杜勒斯拌和得挺卖劲，而且还贴了“必备良药一服即愈”的金字标签，人们还不能不来考虑一下：无神论、唯物主义同侵略力量，果真是必然联系的东西吗？
    倘真是这样，那末，为什么自称上帝的信徒的艾森豪威尔，却下令美国的军队到阿拉伯国家去，至今还不肯下令叫他们退出来呢？艾森豪威尔在对侵黎军士们发表的演说中，不是还大喊“愿上帝保佑你们”的吗？侵黎美军在启运之前，也曾跪倒在地上祷告上帝，牧师不也在替他们祝福的吗？难道只因为他们画过了十字，因此杀人就可以算是替上帝拯救世人，放火劫财也算是替天行道了吗？
    自然，有神论者和唯心主义者并不都就是侵略者，但如今在中东进行侵略，在拉丁美洲进行殖民压迫的人并不是无神论者和唯物主义者，这总是千真万确的。恰恰相反，站在保卫世界和平最前线的，正是无神论者和辩证唯物主义者。联合发出“坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动”的公报的两个巨人，也都是彻底的无神论者和唯物主义者。卖假药没有用，把上帝搬来作侵略者的盾牌，也无法掩蔽这真理。一切信神的和不信神的人，只要是反抗侵略和热爱和平的，都应该团结起来，狠狠地打击侵略者。
    杜勒斯的假药，是无法迷住受压迫人民争取独立解放的真性的。我们等着看这个卖假药的江湖骗子，将是怎样的蚀掉本钱吧！
