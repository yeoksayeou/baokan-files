　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 11th (Reporter Li Shao Yi): Chengdu, in the spirit of self-reliance, is organizing the mechanical manufacturing and repair forces of the entire city's mechanical and non-mechanical industrial systems. By adopting the "ant chewing bone" method, giving full play to the strengths of each unit, and carrying out communist cooperation, they are jointly rushing to produce complete sets of steelmaking and rolling equipment. Currently, two sets of steelmaking and rolling equipment with an annual output of 30,000 tons have been successfully manufactured. This year, the city will produce nine sets of steelmaking and rolling equipment with a total annual output of 310,000 tons, as well as over one hundred various large machine tools for processing steel equipment and a large number of electrical equipment for the iron and steel industry. In this way, the city will not only solve its own difficulties this year but will also transfer some equipment to support the development of the iron and steel industry in other regions.
    Chengdu's mechanical industry has a weak foundation and poor technical conditions. Although it has developed greatly since liberation, its ability to manufacture steel equipment is still insufficient. The factories are small, and the machines are small, making it impossible to process many parts. The steel plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons, which the city is building this year, requires steelmaking and rolling equipment that no single factory in the city can manufacture independently. At that time, the city planned to ask the higher authorities for assistance and also sent people to various provinces to negotiate orders. However, either there was no response, or the delivery date was too late to meet production needs. In response to this situation, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to use the "ant chewing bone" method to produce steel machinery and equipment themselves. The specific approach is to organize the mechanical manufacturing and repair forces of the entire city's mechanical and non-mechanical industrial systems into a large "factory" on a city-wide scale. More than ten units participating in the large-scale production collaboration are all "workshops" of this factory, with some producing steel industry equipment, some producing large machine tools for processing steel equipment, and some producing electrical equipment for the steel industry. If a certain large piece of equipment cannot be manufactured independently by one unit, it will be manufactured in parts by several units, and then assembled. This approach has greatly unleashed the potential of the city's mechanical industry, thus smoothly solving the problem of steel machinery and equipment that was urgently needed this year but had no source.
    In order to completely overcome some of the difficulties in producing large mechanical equipment such as steelmaking and rolling machines, Chengdu has also implemented the spirit of "ant chewing bone" in its technical approach. Relying on the strength and wisdom of the collective, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using small machines to produce large machines, from scratch, and from small to large. They first transformed the original small machines to produce "indigenous" large machine tools, and then used the indigenous machine tools to process various "foreign" machines. A large 50-ton vertical lathe, recently manufactured successfully through the collaboration of six factories, was made using these methods. This vertical lathe, manufactured using indigenous and simple methods, is now being used to produce rolling mills with an annual output of 200,000 tons or less, and various large machine tool equipment.

### 蚂蚁啃骨头的办法值得推广　成都市用小机器制造大设备、土机器生产洋机器

　　蚂蚁啃骨头的办法值得推广
　　成都市用小机器制造大设备、土机器生产洋机器
    新华社成都11日电　新华社记者李绍伊报道：成都市本着自力更生的精神，组织全市机械工业和非机械工业系统的机械制造和修配力量，采取“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，发挥各家所长，开展共产主义大协作，正在合力赶制全套炼钢、轧钢等机械设备。目前已有两套年产三万吨的炼钢、轧钢设备制造成功，今年全市将生产出九套年产共三十一万吨的炼钢、轧钢设备，以及一百多台加工钢铁设备的各种大型机床和大批钢铁工业电器设备。这样，这个市今年不仅解决了本身的困难，而且还将调出部分设备，支援专区发展钢铁工业。
    成都市机械工业的底子薄，技术条件差，解放后虽有很大发展，但要承制钢铁设备能力仍嫌不足，厂小机器小，许多部件无法加工。这个市今年建设的一座年产十万吨的钢铁厂，它所需要的炼钢，轧钢设备，全市没有一个工厂能够单独制造。当时市里造计划向上级要，同时派人到省外各地接洽订购，结果不是没有着落，就是交货期太晚，都不能赶上生产需要。根据这种情况，中共成都市委提出要用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，自己动手生产钢铁机械等设备。具体的作法是，把全市机械工业和非机械工业系统的机械制造和修配力量，组织成一个全市规模的大“工厂”，十多个参加生产大协作的单位都是这个厂的一个“车间”，有的生产钢铁工业设备，有的生产加工钢铁设备的大型机床，有的生产钢铁工业电器设备。某些大型设备一个单位不能单独造的，就由几个单位分头制成部件，最后合拢安装。这种作法大大发挥了全市机械工业的潜力，因而使今年急需但又没有着落的钢铁机械等设备问题顺利地得到了解决。
    为了完全克服生产炼钢、轧钢等大型机械设备的某些困难，成都市在技术路线上也贯彻了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的精神，依靠集体的力量和智慧，土洋结合，用小机器生产大机器，从无到有，从小到大。他们首先将原有的小机器进行改造，生产“土”的大工作母机，然后再用土工作母机来加工各种“洋”机器。最近由六个厂协作制造成功的一部五十吨重的大型落地车床，就是利用这些办法制成的。现在这部用土法和简易方法制造出来的落地车床，已用来生产年产二十万吨以下的轧钢机和各种大型机床设备。
