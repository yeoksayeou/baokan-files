　　Many Treasures in the Hall of Treasures
    In the Hall of Treasures on the east side of the Forbidden City in Beijing, Qing Dynasty relics made of gold, silver, pearls, jade, and precious stones are on display. There are more than 800 precious objects, large and small, including crystal ruyi scepters, amber mountains, fish bone swords, coral lion statues, pearl saddles, gold and jade tableware, golden pagodas, and bottle flowers with gold bottles, jade leaves, and pearl fruits. Among them, the most eye-catching are the sixteen yellow bells (ancient musical instruments) made of more than 13,000 taels of gold. After the Qing Dynasty rule was overthrown, Puyi stole this set of yellow bells and pawned them to the Salt Industry Bank. It was not until 1954 that the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government received them and allocated them to the Palace Museum.
    These items have been actively collected and sorted out by the staff of the Palace Museum, so that they can shine again.
    The Hall of Treasures is open from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm daily; ticket sales stop at 4:30 pm. Tickets are 2 jiao each. (Attached picture)

### 珍宝馆里珍宝多

　　珍宝馆里珍宝多
    北京故宫外东路的珍宝馆里，正陈列着清宫旧藏的金、银、珠、玉、宝石等器物。有水晶如意、琥珀山、鱼骨剑、珊瑚狮像、珍珠马鞍、金玉餐具、黄金宝塔和金瓶、玉叶、珍珠果的瓶花等大小八百多件珍贵器物。其中最惹人注意的是用一万三千多两黄金作成的十六个黄钟（古乐器）。清朝统治被推翻后，溥仪曾把这套黄钟偷出去押给盐业银行。直到1954年由中央人民政府文化部接收后拨交给故宫博物院。
    这些东西，都是经过故宫博物院的职工们积极搜集、整理，才得以重新放出光彩的。
    珍宝馆的开放时间是每天上午八时半至下午五时半；下午四时半停止售票。门票每张两角。（附图片）
