    "Collection of Commune Members' Short Songs"
    Tian Jian has recently compiled a "Collection of Commune Members' Short Songs," which includes more than 120 works by agricultural commune members and rural cadres. These new folk songs of the socialist era comprehensively reflect the earth-shaking changes in China's rural areas since agricultural collectivization, and the process of the growth and strengthening of the socialist countryside. In the preface, Tian Jian wrote a long article, elaborating on the characteristics of amateur creation by the masses in rural areas, and the literary creative talent of the working people.
    Tian Jian's rural street poems written after he went to the countryside, have also recently been compiled into a new collection of poems entitled "Songs of 1958". This collection includes many street paintings drawn by artists who went to the countryside. It will be published by the China Youth Publishing House soon. (Wen)
    The Martyr's Poems
    "Song of October" is a posthumous collection of poems by the proletarian revolutionary fighter, Comrade Chen Hui. From 1940, he led the struggle against the enemy in the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, and was a model cadre in the Fang, Lai, and Zhuo areas. The Jin-Cha-Ji News reported on him at the time. Comrade Chen Hui sacrificed his life in 1944. As a fighter, every one of his poems pierced the enemy like a sharp weapon. The poems collected in this anthology include short songs and long poems, with a fresh and lively style, and sincere and moving emotions. (Jing)
    Thirty kinds of "Literary Quick Stories"
    In order to implement and promote the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Writers Publishing House published thirty kinds of "Literary Quick Stories" under the name of "Popular Literature Publishing House". Each type includes various forms of folk art, vividly showing the leap forward and the great outlook of all parts of the country, and also using satirical techniques to spur on backward aspects. Among them are lyrics, short plays, and quick stories written by new authors such as workers, peasants, and cadres, which are popular with the broad masses. Twenty more types will soon be published under the name of "Writers Publishing House", focusing on breaking superstitions, technological revolution, cultural revolution, and becoming both Red and expert.

    “社员短歌集”
    田间最近编选了一本“社员短歌集”，选辑了一百二十多首农业社员、农村干部的作品。这些社会主义时代的新民歌，全面地反映了农业合作化以来，我国农村惊天动地的变化、社会主义农村成长壮大的过程。书前，田间同志写了一篇很长的序言，详尽地论述了农村群众业余创作的特点，以及劳动人民文学创造的才能。
    田间同志下放以后自己写的农村街头诗，最近也以“1958年歌”为名编成一本新诗集，其中选配了很多画家下乡所画的街头画，不久将由中国青年出版社出版。（文）
    烈士的诗
    “十月的歌”这部诗集，是无产阶级革命战士陈辉同志的一部遗著。他从1940年起，一直在敌后抗日根据地领导对敌斗争，是房、涞、涿地区的模范干部，当时的晋察冀通讯曾表扬过他。1944年陈辉同志牺牲了。作为一个战士，他的每一首诗，都像锋利的武器一样刺伤过敌人。收集在本诗集中的有短歌也有长诗，格调清新明快，感情真挚动人。　　　　　　　　　（靖）
    “文艺快书”三十种
    为了贯彻宣传党的社会主义建设总路线，作家出版社曾以“通俗文艺出版社”名义出版了三十种“文艺快书”。每一种都包括各色各样的曲艺形式，生动活泼地表现出全国各地跃进姿态，伟大面貌，也用讽刺手法鞭策了落后方面。其中还有工人、农民、干部等新作者所写的唱词、短剧、快书等，都是广大群众所喜闻乐读的。最近将以“作家出版社”名义再出版二十种，内容着重在破除迷信、技术革命、文化革命、红透专深等方面。
