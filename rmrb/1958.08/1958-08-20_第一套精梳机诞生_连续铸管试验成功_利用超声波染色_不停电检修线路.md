First Comber Born  Continuous Casting Pipe Experiment Successful
　　Ultrasonic Dyeing Used  Live Line Maintenance

Xinhua News Agency: The mechanical repair workers of Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill successfully trial-produced China's first comber, which is essential for the production of high-grade textiles, on the 15th. The test run was very good, and the manufacturing quality reached international standards.
　　The comber is currently the most advanced, most precise, and most complex textile machine in the world, with the most parts. With this machine, high-quality high-count cotton yarn can be spun, such as 100-count, 300-count, or even 400-count high-grade cotton yarn.
　　Also reported: The world's advanced casting technology—continuous casting pipe—has recently achieved preliminary success in experiments at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.
　　The so-called continuous casting pipe means that while molten iron is poured in, pipes can be drawn out, and pipes of various lengths can be drawn.
　　Continuous casting pipe is far superior to the sand mold casting pipe and hard mold casting pipe currently used in China. It can eliminate the mold-making, core-making, and core-baking processes of sand mold casting, reduce the labor intensity of pipe casting workers, improve the working environment, and completely eliminate dust and fumes in the pipe casting field.
　　Also reported: Three electrical workers from the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill recently made an ultrasonic transmitter and successfully tested ultrasonic dyeing. A small sample of indanthrene blue cloth dyed with ultrasonic vibration for the first time showed deep color penetration to the core of the cloth; while a piece of indanthrene blue cloth dyed by ordinary methods, although using the same amount of dye and the same amount of time, was dyed lighter, and the core of the cloth was still white.
　　The use of ultrasonic dyeing is still being researched and tested abroad and has not yet been widely adopted. According to foreign data, it can make the dye evenly penetrate the fibers of the cotton cloth, so that the blue khaki worn daily will not show white even when worn out, and the dyeing efficiency can be increased by more than twenty times.
　　Also reported: Power line maintenance workers directly contact ultra-high-voltage power lines to maintain live lines and install various power transmission and transformation equipment on the lines. This new method of maintaining power transmission lines, which is currently only used in the Soviet Union in the world, has recently been successfully tested at the Shenyang Central Testing Institute of the Liaoning and Jilin Electric Power Administration. With this new method, power transmission lines can basically avoid power outages caused by line maintenance.
　　The method of directly contacting live lines for maintenance is based on the principle of equipotential. (Attached picture)

### 第一套精梳机诞生　连续铸管试验成功　利用超声波染色　不停电检修线路

　　第一套精梳机诞生  连续铸管试验成功
　　利用超声波染色  不停电检修线路
    据新华社讯  上海国棉二厂的机械修理工人，在15日试制成功我国第一套生产高级纺织品必不可少的精梳机，试车情况很好，制造质量达到国际水平。
    精梳机是目前世界上纺织机械中最先进、精密度最高、零件最多最复杂的一种机器。有了这种机器，才可以纺出质量优良的高级棉纱，如一百支，三百支甚至四百支的高级棉纱。
    又讯  世界上先进的铸造技术——连续铸管最近在石景山钢铁厂初步试验成功。
    所谓连续铸管，就是一边浇铁水，一边即可拉出管子，而且可以拉出各种长度不等的管子。
    连续铸管比我国目前采用的沙模铸管、硬模铸管优越得多。它可以取消沙模铸管时的制模、制芯、烤芯等工序，而且能减轻铸管工人的劳动强度和改善劳动环境，彻底消除铸管场里的粉尘，烟气等。
    又讯  上海第二棉纺织厂三个电气工人最近制成超声波发射器，试用超声波染色成功。初次用超声波震荡染液染出的一块士林蓝布小样，颜色深透到布芯子里；而用普通方法染出的一块士林蓝布，虽然花了同样多的染料、同样多的时间，但颜色染得比较浅，布芯子里还是白的。
    利用超声波染色在国外还正在研究试验，尚未普遍采用。据国外资料记载，它可以使染料均匀地渗透在棉布的纤维上，使日常穿的蓝卡其直到穿破也不会显露白色，并且染色的效率还可以提高二十多倍。
    又讯  电力线路检修工人直接接触超高压电线，能够检修正在送电的线路和在线路上安装各种送变电设备。这个目前在世界上还只有苏联采用过的检修送电线路的新方法，最近在辽吉电业管理局沈阳中心试验所试验成功。送电线路采用这种新方法，就能基本上避免因检修线路而造成的停电现象。
    人身直接接触正在送电的线路进行检修的方法，是根据同电位原理来进行的。（附图片）
