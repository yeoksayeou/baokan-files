Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: The Hong Kong British authorities have carried out a series of persecutory actions against Chinese schools in Hong Kong over the past nine years, consistently implementing a policy of deliberately undermining the education of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. This policy, which is severely hostile to the Chinese people, has become even more blatant this year. At the end of 1949, the Hong Kong British authorities took the first measure to persecute Chinese educators, which was to order the dissolution of the "Teachers' Welfare Association," a mass organization of teachers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, in order to disintegrate and divide the unity of Chinese teachers.

In January 1950, the Hong Kong British authorities, on the grounds that "the Governor did not like it," forcibly deported Lu Dong, the principal of Heung To Middle School. Soon after, they unreasonably persecuted the Hong Kong Labor Children's School, forcibly took back the school building of the Mong Kok Labor Children's School, disbanded some primary schools run by trade unions, and sealed up the fishermen's schools in Cheung Chau and Aberdeen. At the same time, under the pretext that the school's "fire prevention facilities did not meet standards," they prepared to cancel the registration of Han Hua Middle School. Only after the resolute struggle of all the students and staff of Han Hua Middle School to protect the school, and the protests of people from all walks of life, did the Hong Kong British Education Department temporarily back down.

In January 1951, the Hong Kong British authorities suddenly dispatched a large number of police to search Heung To Middle School and Hung Hom Labor Children's School, and took teachers from both schools to the police station for questioning. In March, without announcing any reason, they disbanded the Southern College, which had been engaged in vocational youth education for many years. More seriously, at the end of September of the same year, the Hong Kong schools' application for a holiday on National Day, October 1st, was rejected by the Education Department.

In 1952, the Hong Kong authorities ridiculously demanded that Chinese schools be treated as shops for inspection and that they be subject to so-called "commercial registration," which was a great insult to Chinese schools. During this year, the Hong Kong authorities also prohibited the Hong Kong Labor Children's School from holding annual flag-selling fundraising activities; forcibly deported educator Lu Gang; dispatched a large number of police to unreasonably search the residence of Xu Tianshi, a teacher at Yuqun Middle School; and on December 18, passed a new education ordinance that was extremely reactionary. Shortly after the implementation of this new education ordinance, starting in 1953, the Hong Kong British Education Department issued many so-called "permanent circulars" to schools, restricting the rights of Chinese people to run schools, and conducted large-scale school inspections of patriotic schools to find excuses to persecute the schools. Then, under the pretext that the Zhiqiang Middle School building was a "dangerous building," they forcibly demolished and relocated it. Later, the Kowloon Dairy Workers' Children's School had its registration canceled by the Hong Kong Education Department. In July 1953, the Hong Kong Education Department announced a list of approved textbooks, listing a large number of books published by the Chiang Kai-shek Group as textbooks for Hong Kong schools. In the approved textbooks for high schools, books published by the Chiang Kai-shek Group accounted for the majority.

Later, the restrictions on textbooks were strengthened year by year, until July of this year, when the Hong Kong Education Department announced that all previous approved book lists were invalid and issued a new list of approved books. According to this list, Hong Kong schools were completely unable to use textbooks published in China, and many textbooks published in Hong Kong were also prohibited from being used, while textbooks published by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group and by US-Chiang agents in Hong Kong were used in even greater quantities.

In addition to the restrictions on textbooks, the performance of plays was also severely restricted.

On December 16, 1957, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of police, using violent means to demolish a charitable school dedicated to accommodating poor children—the Fot莲义校, forcing more than 300 poor children to drop out of school.

Since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong British authorities' measures to persecute the education of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon have become more blatant. In early January, the Hong Kong British Legislative Council passed the "1957 (Amendment) Education Ordinance" as a basis for further persecuting Chinese schools. Subsequently, a series of persecutory incidents followed. On February 1, the Hong Kong authorities sentenced two staff members of a literacy class run by the Planting Association's Qingshan Branch for violating the education ordinance, and at the same time unreasonably searched some other literacy classes. On April 18, officials from the Education Department suddenly inspected the library of Pui Kiu Middle School and confiscated nineteen books. On May 1, they used the absurd excuse that the "Education Ordinance" contained a provision prohibiting schools from hanging so-called "political and semi-political" flags to interfere unreasonably with the hanging of the Chinese national flag by nine schools, including Han Hua Middle School. On May 11, they prohibited New Qiao Middle School from hanging the Chinese national flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on its anniversary. On July 29, under the pretext that the "school building was dilapidated and unsuitable for classes," they ordered the closure of the Wenming School in the Tai Po District of Kowloon, despite the opposition of all thirty-two villages in the area. On August 6, the Hong Kong British authorities unreasonably forced Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, to leave Hong Kong. On the morning of August 26, the Hong Kong British authorities, after unreasonably ordering the closure of the Hong Kong Chinese Middle School building on the pretext that the school building was "dangerous," suddenly dispatched a large number of armed police to forcibly close the Chinese Middle School building, and beat the school's teachers and students and Chinese journalists who were there to cover the event, causing a bloody incident.

During these nine years, the Hong Kong British authorities, on the other hand, have been protecting and condoning US-Chiang elements in Hong Kong schools to engage in frenzied activities against the People's Republic of China.

Although the British government has recognized the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong British Education Department has interfered with patriotic schools hanging the Chinese national flag on the one hand, and condoned schools run by US-Chiang secret agents in Hong Kong hanging the abandoned flag that has long been abandoned by the Chinese people as the Chinese national flag on the other hand. In the past six months, the Hong Kong British authorities have intensified their efforts, step by step intensifying their persecution and destruction of the education of the Chinese people and educators in Hong Kong and Kowloon, in order to carry out their policy of deliberately being hostile to China, creating "two Chinas," and implementing a policy of enslavement education among the Chinese people in Hong Kong. Now, they are frantically creating the bloody incident at Chinese Middle School, which is bound to arouse great indignation among Hong Kong compatriots and the entire Chinese people. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have solemnly pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities must abolish this policy of deliberately undermining the education of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the Chinese people will resolutely not allow this reactionary policy to continue to be implemented.

　　铁的罪证
    香港英国当局蓄意摧残港九中国人民教育事业
    据新华社30日讯　香港英国当局九年来对香港中国学校进行了一系列的迫害行动，一贯地执行着一项蓄意摧残港九中国人民教育事业的政策，这项严重地敌视中国人民的政策，今年来有了更加露骨的发展。1949年底，香港英国当局就采取了第一个迫害中国教育工作者的措施，那就是勒令解散港九教师的群众团体“教师福利会”，以便瓦解分化中国教师的团结。
    1950年1月，香港英国当局又以“港督不喜欢”为理由，强迫递解香岛中学校长卢动出境。其后不久，无理迫害香港劳工子弟学校，强迫收回旺角劳工子弟学校的校舍，解散了一些工会所办的小学，查封了长洲与香港仔的渔民学校。同时，又以校舍“防火设备不合规格”为借口，准备取消汉华中学的注册，只是在经过汉华中学全体员生进行坚决的护校斗争和社会人士的抗议之后，香港英国教育司才不得不临时缩手。
    1951年1月间，香港英国当局突然派遣大批警察，搜查香岛中学及红碪劳工子弟学校，并将两校教师带警署盘问。3月，又不宣布任何理由，解散了从事职业青年教育多年的南方学院。更严重的是在同年9月底，香港各学校申请在10月1日国庆节放假，竟然受到教育司拒绝。
    1952年，香港当局又极为荒谬地要求把中国学校作为商店视察，要向工商所进行所谓“商业登记”，这是对中国学校的极大侮辱。在这一年间，香港当局还禁止香港劳工子弟学校每年为筹募经费进行的卖花筹款活动；强迫教育工作者吕冈出境；派遣大批警察无理搜查育群中学教师许天石的住宅；并在12月18日通过一个反动透顶的新教育条例。就在这个新教育条例实施后不久，1953年开始，香港英国教育司就向学校发出了许多限制中国人办学权利的所谓“永久性通告”，对爱国学校进行大规模的查学以寻找迫害学校的借口。接着就以志强中学校舍系“危楼”为借口，强迫拆迁，以后又有牛乳公司工人子弟学校被香港教育司取消注册。香港教育司在1953年7月公布了一个准用教科书名单，大量列举了许多蒋介石集团出版的书籍作为香港学校的课本。在高中准用教科书中，蒋介石集团出版的书籍占了大半。
    以后，又逐年加强对教科书的限制，直至今年7月，香港教育司宣布以前准用书单全部作废，另外重新颁发一个新的准用书目。按照这个书目，香港学校完全不能采用中国出版的教科书，香港出版的教科书也有许多被禁止采用，而台湾蒋介石集团出版的以及美蒋特务在香港出版的教科书却被更加大量地采用。
    除了对教科书的限制以外，对学校演出剧本也横加限制。
    1957年12月16日香港英国当局出动大批警察，用强暴手段把一所专门收容贫苦学童的慈善学校——佛莲义校拆毁，迫使三百多个贫苦学童失学。
    今年以来，香港英国当局迫害港九中国人民教育事业的措施更为露骨，1月初，香港英国立法局通过了“1957年（修正）教育条例”，作为进一步迫害中国学校的张本。随后，一连串的迫害事件就随之而发生。2月1日香港当局以违犯教育条例为借口，对种植公会青山支会所办的识字班两个工作人员判罪，同时又对另外一些识字班进行了无理搜查。4月18日教育司署官员突然检查培侨中学图书馆，检去书籍十九册。5月1日又以“教育条例”中有一项禁止学校悬挂所谓“政治性和半政治性的”旗帜的规定作为荒谬的借口横蛮无理地干涉汉华中学等九所学校悬挂中国国旗。5月11日，又禁止新侨中学在校庆日悬挂中国国旗和唱中国国歌。7月29日，又以“校舍残旧，不宜上课”为名，不顾九龙大埔区三十二村全体村民的反对，勒令这个区的文明学校停办。8月6日，香港英国当局无理强迫培侨中学校长杜伯奎离开香港。8月26日晨香港英国当局继借口香港中华中学校舍建筑“有危险”无理下令封闭校舍后，突然派出大批武装警察强行封闭中华中学校舍，并且殴打该校师生和到场采访的中国新闻记者，造成流血事件。
    在这九年间，香港英国当局另一方面却一直包庇和纵容美蒋分子在香港学校中疯狂地进行反对中华人民共和国的活动。
    尽管英国政府承认了中华人民共和国，香港英国教育司署却一面干涉爱国学校悬挂中国国旗，一面纵容香港的美蒋特务分子主办的学校悬挂早已被中国人民所废弃的废旗作为中国国旗。近半年来香港英国当局更加变本加厉，步步加紧其对港九中国人民教育事业和教育工作者的迫害和摧残，以遂行其在香港中国人民中肆意进行敌视中国，制造“两个中国”和实施奴化教育的政策。现在竟然疯狂地制造中华中学流血事件，这就必然引起了香港同胞和全中国人民的极大愤慨。香港社会各界人士都严正地指出，香港英国当局必须取消这一项蓄意破坏港九中国人民教育事业的政策，中国人民坚决不容许这项反动的政策继续执行下去。
