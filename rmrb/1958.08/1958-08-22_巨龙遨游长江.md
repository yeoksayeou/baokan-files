　　A Giant Dragon Roams the Yangtze River
    On August 12th, a miracle occurred on the Yangtze River: a tugboat towing twelve iron barges, advanced against the waves like a giant dragon. This was the "Shengmin" tugboat of the Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau. It loaded 21,090 tons of coal and building materials from Yuxikou Port in Anhui, and safely arrived in Shanghai after an actual sailing time of 39.08 hours, breaking the national record of 11,142 tons towed by the "Shenghui" tugboat on August 8th.
    The twelve barges in this fleet were arranged to be 888 meters long. The fleet's carrying capacity exceeded the carrying capacity of two 10,000-ton giant ships, and it was also nearly twice as high as the maximum traction force of a train.

　　巨龙遨游长江
    8月12日，长江上出现了一个奇迹：一艘拖轮拖了十二艘铁驳，像一条巨龙一样破浪前进。这是长江航运局上海分局的生民拖轮，它从安徽裕溪口港装了二万一千零九十吨煤炭和建筑材料，经过三十九点零八分的实际航行时间，安全抵达上海，打破了8月8日生辉轮拖一万一千一百四十二吨的全国最高纪录。
    这个船队的十二艘驳船排列起来有八百八十八公尺长，船队载重量超过两艘万吨巨轮的载重量，也比火车最高的牵引力高出将近一倍。
