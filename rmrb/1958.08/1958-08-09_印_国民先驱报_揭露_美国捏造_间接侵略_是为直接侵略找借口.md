    Indian "National Herald" Exposes
    U.S. Fabrication of "Indirect Aggression" as a Pretext for Direct Aggression

    (Reported by this newspaper) New Delhi dispatch: The Indian "National Herald" published an editorial on August 2nd entitled "Interventionism," criticizing the U.S. and British armed aggression against the Middle East and exposing the U.S. and Britain's emphasis on the so-called "indirect aggression" to create excuses for their direct aggression.

    The editorial pointed out: The U.S. and Britain's "presented excuses cannot prove that the presence of American troops in Lebanon or British troops in Jordan is justified; if such actions can be proven justifiable, it would also prove that the invasion of foreign troops into any other place is justifiable."

    The editorial then severely refuted the U.S. and Britain's fabricated lies about the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic conducting so-called "indirect aggression" against Lebanon and Jordan. It stated: "Some people talk a great deal about indirect aggression to find excuses for what can be called naked intervention. However, indirect aggression has not been proven. ... Even the accusation of indirect aggression is only supported by American intelligence, but, judging from the materials recently published in Egyptian newspapers, supported by photocopied documents, the United States can be accused of indirect aggression against Arab nationalism and against the United Arab Republic—if not against other Arab countries."

    The editorial refuted the various excuses made by the U.S. for armed intervention in Lebanon point by point, saying: "Some say that intervention in Lebanon is justified under the Eisenhower Doctrine; this argument cannot even convince American lawmakers. The claim that 'countries controlled by international communism' are carrying out armed aggression against Lebanon is also untenable. Another possible argument is that such intervention is justified under the Mansfield Amendment to the Eisenhower Doctrine, but Senator Mansfield, the original proposer, has himself refuted this interpretation." The "National Herald" also revealed that the U.S. attempted to use the lie of "indirect aggression" to carry out intervention and subversion activities against the United Arab Republic. The editorial pointed out: "The accusation of indirect aggression is directed more at President Nasser of the United Arab Republic than at the Soviet Union; therefore, the United States has not been able to reconcile its declared friendship with the United Arab Republic with its well-known attempts to subvert that republic."

    The editorial finally solemnly warned the U.S. interventionists: "The United States has become addicted to interventionism, and it must end it immediately." (Attached picture)

### 印“国民先驱报”揭露  美国捏造“间接侵略”是为直接侵略找借口

    印“国民先驱报”揭露
    美国捏造“间接侵略”是为直接侵略找借口
    本报讯  新德里消息：印度“国民先驱报”8月2日发表题为“干涉主义”的社论，抨击美英对中东的武装侵略，并揭露美英在所谓“间接侵略”上大做文章，是为了给它们的直接侵略制造借口。
    社论指出：美英“所提出的一切借口并不是都可以证明美国军队驻在黎巴嫩或英国军队驻在约旦是正当的；如果能够证明这种行动很正当的话，那也就能够证明外国军队侵入任何别的地方都是正当的。”
    社论接着严厉驳斥了美英制造的苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩和约旦进行所谓“间接侵略”的谎言。它说：“有人大谈其间接侵略，来替可以称之为赤裸裸的干涉的行为寻找借口。然而，间接侵略并没有得到证明。……就是间接侵略的指责，也只得到美国谍报的支持，但是，从埃及报纸上最近所发表的、以影印文件加以证明的材料来看，倒可以指责美国对阿拉伯民族主义以及对阿拉伯联合共和国——如果不说是对其他阿拉伯国家——进行间接侵略。
    社论逐点地驳斥了美国对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉的各项借口说：“有人说对黎巴嫩的干涉根据艾森豪威尔主义是正当的，这种论点甚至不能说服美国的议员。‘受国际共产主义控制的国家’对黎巴嫩进行武装侵略的说法也是站不住脚的。另一个可能提出的论点是：根据艾森豪威尔主义的曼斯菲尔德修正案，这种干涉是正当的，但是原提案人参议员曼斯菲尔德自己已经驳斥了这种解释。”“国民先驱报”还揭露，美国企图利用“间接侵略”的谎言，对阿拉伯联合共和国进行干涉和颠复活动。社论指出：“间接侵略的指责，与其说是针对苏联，倒不如说是针对阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔，因此美国没有能够使它所宣布的对阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊同人所共知的它企图颠复那个共和国的活动协调起来。”
    社论最后严正地警告美国干涉者说：“美国已经沉溺于干涉主义，它必须立刻结束它”。（附图片）
