Pupa Oil Residue Can Be Refined into Gasoline
The experimental refining of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel from pupa oil residue has been successful at the Third Factory of the China Silk Company in Haining, Zhejiang. The quality fully meets standards according to the results of the chemical analysis unit.

Experiments have proven that 100 jin of pupa oil residue can yield 65 jin of oil, of which gasoline accounts for 11.91%, kerosene accounts for 8.7%, and diesel accounts for 79.39%. The residue left over from refining can also be used to manufacture potassium carbonate and other medicines. This creation has opened up a new avenue for the comprehensive utilization of silkworm factory by-products. This creation was successfully tested by Li Liangen, a worker and Communist Party member of the No. 3 Silk Factory. The factory is now rushing to manufacture equipment in preparation for mass production.

    蛹油残渣可炼汽油
    从蛹油残渣中提炼汽油、煤油和柴油，已在浙江海宁中国丝绸公司第三厂试验成功，经化验单位鉴定结果，质量完全符合标准。
    试验证明，每百斤蛹油残渣可以出油六十五斤，其中汽油占11.91％，煤油占8.7％，柴油占79.39％。炼油剩下的残渣还可用来制造碳酸钾等药物。这一创造为缫丝厂副产品的综合利用又开辟了一条新途径。这一创造是由中丝三厂工人共产党员李连根试验成功的。现在这个工厂正在赶制设备，准备大量投入生产。
