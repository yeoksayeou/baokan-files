Xinhua News Agency, August 28th, Little Rock Dispatch: Legalizing Racial Discrimination.
	Arkansas Legislature Prohibits Integrated Schools
	According to Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, the Arkansas state legislature in the southern United States held a special session on the 26th and 27th, passing six bills in an atmosphere of rampant racism to insist on racial discrimination in all state schools. According to these bills, if any public school implements integrated education for black and white students, Governor Faubus has the power to close the school.
	This meeting was convened at the request of Governor Faubus (a leader of racist elements).
	Little Rock, Arkansas, experienced a world-shaking persecution of black students last year. With the new school year approaching, racists and opponents of racial discrimination are once again engaging in a sharp struggle surrounding the issue of integrated schools in Little Rock. The racist elements in Arkansas, led by Faubus, are frantically engaged in activities to insist on racial segregation in schools. At Faubus's request, the Little Rock School Board on August 20th requested the U.S. Court of Appeals to postpone the implementation of integrated education in Little Rock in order to buy time to finally bury this decision. The Court of Appeals agreed to this request. However, the NAACP on the 22nd again requested the U.S. Supreme Court to cancel this decision of the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court has decided to hold an emergency meeting on the 28th of this month to review this issue. Faubus convened this special session of the Arkansas legislature to pass his bills insisting on opposing integrated education ahead of the Supreme Court, so that he could refuse to implement any rulings unfavorable to them if the Supreme Court made such a ruling.

### 种族歧视合法化  阿肯色州议会禁止黑白人合校

　　种族歧视合法化
    阿肯色州议会禁止黑白人合校
    据新华社28日讯　小石城消息：美国南部阿肯色州的州议会，在26日、27日两天举行了特别会议，在嚣张的种族主义气氛中通过了六项坚持在全州学校中实行种族歧视的法案。根据这些法案，如果任何一个公立学校实行黑白种学生合校，州长福布斯有权封闭这个学校。
    这次会议是应州长福布斯（种族主义分子头子）的要求召开的。
    阿肯色州的小石城去年曾经发生了轰动世界的迫害黑人学生的事件。随着新学年的即将到来，种族主义者和反对种族歧视的人们正环绕着小石城的黑白学生合校问题再度展开尖锐斗争。以福布斯为首的阿肯色州种族主义分子正在猖狂地进行活动，坚持在学校中实行种族隔离政策。根据福布斯的要求，小石城的学校委员会8月20日曾向美国上诉法院提出要求在小石城延期执行黑白学生合校的决定，以便争取时间最后埋葬这一决定。上诉法院同意了这个请求。但是美国“全国有色人种协进会”在22日再度要求美国最高法院取消上诉法院的这一决定。最高法院已决定在本月28日举行一次紧急会议来审查这一问题。福布斯召开这次阿肯色州议会的特别会议，目的就在于抢在最高法院的前面先通过他的坚持反对黑白学生合校的法案，以便在最高法院万一作出对他们不利的裁决时拒不实行。
