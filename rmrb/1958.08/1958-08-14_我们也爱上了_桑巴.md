We Have Also Fallen in Love with "Samba"
Zhu Shulan

    In these days when the people of Latin America are launching a high tide of national liberation movements and fiercely opposing American colonialists, the Chinese people have the opportunity to receive cultural envoys from Brazil who have crossed four continents. This will allow the people of both countries to gain a deeper understanding of each other. Although Chinese audiences are enjoying Brazilian song and dance art for the first time, from the first day of the Brazilian Radio and Television Artists Delegation's performance, we have fallen in love with the beautiful song and dance art of the Brazilian people, especially the "Samba," which is most loved by the Brazilian people.

    "Samba" is a unique musical form of the Brazilian people. In the solo performances, light music performances, and performances by the Farroupilha Five-Person Song and Dance Troupe of the Brazilian Radio and Television Artists Delegation, the "Samba" songs that run through the entire program are not only colorful but also have rich expressiveness. Its rhythm is so strong, powerful, and exciting, fully expressing the Brazilian people's passionate character and endless vitality. The performances of the Brazilian artists are full of a strong atmosphere of life. When we watch them perform, it is as if we have gone to the villages in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro during the festival, or the picturesque Copacabana Beach. We cannot help but sing along, singing the songs that our Brazilian friends love.

    The singing of several singers in the Brazilian Radio and Television Artists Delegation has its own characteristics. The way Milton Costa, a black man, sings is so humorous and vivid that the audience cannot help but laugh heartily. Nora Ney is an outstanding "Samba" singer in Brazilian radio and film circles. When she sings the Samba dance music, "No one loves me, no one loves me, what can I do when old age comes?" the audience is moved by her deep feelings and melancholy. When she sings another interesting song depicting girls missing their lovers, "Handsome Young Man," the audience is brought into a relaxed and happy mood again. Jorge Goulart, a famous Brazilian baritone singer, has a lyrical and moving voice and is good at singing folk songs. He is a singer loved by the Brazilian people and also by audiences in various Latin American countries. Several songs he sang praising the motherland, "Lovely Brazil" and "Sing, Brazil!" are full of the Brazilian people's love for their motherland, just like a line in his song says: "I want to sing loudly for you." Chinese audiences especially appreciate Jorge Goulart's song depicting black people's lives, "Arid Land." He not only expresses the painful groans of black people, but what is most touching is that it truly reflects the black people's rebellious mood that they can no longer endure. Maria Helena Raposo, a contralto singer, is a very talented young singer. Although she has only been a professional actress for two years, she has already shown excellent singing talent. She has a wide range, deep emotions, and skilled performance skills. The songs she sings are mostly about the black people's yearning and pursuit for a happy and beautiful life. Her charming voice sings out the black people's lofty aspirations.

    The Farroupilha Five-Person Song and Dance Troupe is a well-known folk song and dance group in Brazil. Their footprints have spread all over Brazil and have been appreciated by audiences in many countries in South and Central America. They are known for performing the songs and dances of the Gaucho people in southern Brazil. In their singing and dancing performances, the beautiful and harmonious quintet, combined with the cheerful folk dances, leaves a deep impression on the audience. In addition, the performance of the light music band also has a strong national flavor.

    Thank you to the Brazilian artists for coming. They will make a great contribution to the cultural exchange between China and Brazil. Congratulations to them for greater success in their performances.

　　我们也爱上了“桑巴”
　　朱树兰
    在拉丁美洲人民掀起了一个民族解放运动高潮，激烈反对美国殖民者的日子里，中国人民有机会接待越过四大洲，来自巴西的文化使者，将使两国人民得到进一步的了解。中国观众虽然是第一次欣赏巴西的歌舞艺术，但从巴西广播电视艺术家代表团演出的第一天起，我们就爱上了巴西人民优美的歌舞艺术，特别是巴西人民最喜爱的“桑巴”。
    “桑巴”是巴西人民特有的一种音乐形式。在巴西广播电视艺术家代表团的独唱、轻音乐演奏和法鲁比亚五人歌舞团的表演中，贯穿全部节目的“桑巴”歌曲，不仅绚烂多采而且有丰富的表现力。它的节奏是那样强烈有力、激动人心，充分地表现了巴西人民热情奔放的性格，和无穷尽的生命力。巴西艺术家们的表演富有浓厚的生活气息，看他们表演的时候，我们就像去到了节日的里约热内卢近郊的村镇，或是美丽如画的可加拉海滩。我们禁不住随声唱和，唱起巴西朋友心爱的歌。
    巴西广播电视艺术家代表团几位歌唱家的演唱各有特色。黑人密尔东·科斯塔唱得是那么风趣、生动，使观众不能不发出衷心的笑声。诺拉·涅伊是巴西广播电台和电影界出色的“桑巴”歌手。当她唱着：“谁也不爱我，谁也不爱我，老年来临，怎奈何？”这首桑巴舞曲时，观众被她的深情和忧郁感动了。她唱起另一首描写姑娘们想念自己爱人的有趣的“英俊的小伙子”时，观众又被她带到轻松、愉快的情绪中了。巴西著名的上低音歌唱家乔治·哥拉尔特有着抒情而又动人的声音，善长于演唱民歌。他是巴西人民喜爱的歌手，也是拉丁美洲各国观众喜爱的歌手。他唱的几首歌颂祖国的歌曲：“可爱的巴西”、“歌唱吧！巴西”，充满着巴西人民对祖国的热爱，正像他唱的一句歌词所说的：“我要为你引吭高歌。”中国观众特别欣赏乔治·哥拉尔特唱的一首描绘黑人生活的歌子“干旱的土地”，他不但表现了黑人的痛苦呻吟，最感人的是真实地反映了黑人再也不能忍耐的反抗心情。女低音玛丽娅·爱莱娜·拉波索是一位很有才华的年轻歌唱家，虽然她作一个职业演员，仅仅只有两年，却已经显示出优异的歌唱才能。她有着宽广的音域、深厚的感情和娴熟的表现技巧。她演唱的歌曲，大都是抒发黑人对于幸福美好生活的向往和追寻，她那富有魅力的歌声，唱出了黑人崇高的心愿。
    法鲁比亚五人歌舞团是巴西家喻户晓的民间歌舞团体。他们的足迹曾遍及全巴西，并且受到南美、中美许多国家观众的赞赏。他们以表演巴西南部高丘族的歌舞见称。在他们载歌载舞的表演中，优美、和谐的五重唱，配合着欢快的民间舞蹈，给观众留下了很深的印象。此外，轻音乐队的演奏，也是具有浓厚的民族情调的。
    感谢巴西艺术家们的来临，他们将对中巴两国的文化交流作出很大的贡献。祝贺他们的演出获得更大的成功。
