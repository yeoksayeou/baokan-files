The yarn factory was vast, the capitalist ate foreign white flour, the foreman ate rice, the apprentices ate black cornbread, pickled vegetables mixed with cold water. If an apprentice got sick, they went to the "hospital," swallowed two pills and that was the end of it. They returned to the underworld in three days, six planks were nailed tightly, two people hoisted the coffin onto their shoulders, a whip cracked behind.
(According to oral accounts of old workers from the Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill)

　　旧社会工人苦××纱厂一大片，资本家吃的是洋白面，工头吃的是大米干饭，徒工吃的黑狗蛋，咸菜条子冷水拌，徒弟病了上“医院”，两付药丸吃了就完蛋，三天回阴间，六块板子钉得严，二人上了肩，屁股后面一挂鞭。
    （据天津棉纺三厂老工人口述）
