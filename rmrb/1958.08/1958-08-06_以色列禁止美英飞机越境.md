Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, August 5th: Israeli authorities announced on the 4th that the Israeli government has demanded that the United States and Britain immediately cease airlifting military personnel and supplies to Jordan through Israeli airspace. Flights by US and British military aircraft from Beirut and Cyprus through Israel to Amman were halted on the 3rd.

Sources say that the Israeli authorities made this decision because they were dissatisfied with the US and British recognition of Iraq. Other reports say that Israel took this action after receiving a note from the Soviet Foreign Ministry on August 1st warning it not to be an accomplice to aggressors.

When Britain sent troops to invade Jordan on July 17, it used Israeli airspace to transport 2,000 paratroopers into Jordan. Since then, British and American military transport planes have continuously flown over Israel, transporting gasoline and other equipment and supplies to the British troops invading Jordan. The Israeli government's actions in providing an air bridge to the US and British aggressors have been strongly opposed by the broad masses of the people at home.

It is reported that after Israel took action to ban US and British military aircraft from passing over Israeli airspace, the British and American ambassadors to Israel met with Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion on the 4th, one after the other, to put pressure on him to allow US and British military aircraft to fly over Israeli airspace "when necessary" to airlift invading troops and military supplies to Jordan.

    以色列禁止美英飞机越境
    据新华社5日讯　耶路撒冷消息：以色列权威方面4日宣布，以色列政府已经要求美国和英国立即停止通过以色列领空空运军事人员和给养到约旦。美国和英国的军用飞机从贝鲁特和塞浦路斯经过以色列到安曼的飞行已在3日停止。
    有消息说，以色列当局作出这个决定是由于它不满美英承认伊拉克。另外的消息说，以色列是在接到苏联外交部8月1日警告它不要作侵略者的直接帮凶的照会之后采取这个行动的。
    英国在7月17日派军队侵入约旦时，就是通过以色列领空把两千名伞兵运入约旦的。其后，英国和美国的军用运输机一直不断地经过以色列上空把汽油和其他装备、给养运给侵约英军。以色列政府向美英侵略者提供空中桥梁的行动曾经遭到国内广大人民的强烈反对。
    据报道，在以色列采取禁止美英军用飞机通过以色列上空的行动以后，驻以色列的英美两国大使在4日先后会见了以色列总理本—古里安，对他施加压力，要他允许美英军用飞机“在必要的情况下”可以飞过以色列领空，空运侵略军队和军用品到约旦去。
