Xinhua News Agency, August 16th—Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai hosted a grand state banquet this evening to warmly welcome the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and all distinguished guests of the Cambodian Royal National Delegation led by him.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Sihanouk delivered speeches at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere. They both congratulated the long-standing kinship-like friendship between China and Cambodia, the recent formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit.

Tonight, the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel, surrounded by evergreen palms, was adorned with the national flags of China and Cambodia. As Prime Minister Sihanouk, his daughter Princess Soriya Lonsey, and other Cambodian distinguished guests entered the banquet hall, the orchestra played welcoming music. The distinguished guests, accompanied by Premier Zhou, met and shook hands with leaders of our state and government at a reception held before the banquet began.

Among those present at the banquet and reception were Vice Premiers He Long, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian; Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen; Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng; Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo; heads of various departments of our state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties; as well as the head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation in Beijing, Yang Ann, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

Premier Zhou Enlai first delivered a speech (full text on page two) at the banquet to welcome the distinguished guests. After recounting the development of friendly relations between the two countries, he pointed out: "Recently, thanks to the initiative of His Royal Highness the Prince, our two countries formally established diplomatic relations, bringing the friendly relations between the two countries to a new stage. Of course, the development of Sino-Cambodian friendship has not been without obstruction and sabotage from colonialist forces. However, because the governments and peoples of China and Cambodia fully believe that Sino-Cambodian friendly relations are in line with the vital interests of both countries and have made unremitting efforts for this, the colonialist forces' attempt to alienate China and Cambodia has been thwarted. The smooth development of Sino-Cambodian friendly relations is a victory for the peoples of China and Cambodia, and also a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit."

Premier Zhou then profoundly discussed the international situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" and the great significance of the vigorous rise of national independence movements worldwide. He said: "Nationalist countries that uphold national independence and oppose colonialism, with the support of socialist countries and other peace-loving countries and peoples, have formed a huge anti-imperialist torrent. The series of great victories achieved by the people of Egypt, the people of Syria, the people of Indonesia, the people of Iraq, the people of North Africa, and the people of Latin America all demonstrate that this torrent is irresistible. Cambodia's adherence to national independence, opposition to foreign interference and oppression, and advocacy of equality among all countries, regardless of size, precisely express the common aspirations of nationalist countries." Premier Zhou pointed out that imperialist elements refuse to learn from the lessons of history and still desperately attempt to maintain or restore their colonial rule by force. The armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan is an example. The wheels of history cannot be reversed, and the perverse actions of Western imperialist elements will eventually be punished by history.

Finally, Premier Zhou expressed his hope that when Prince Sihanouk and friends of the delegation visit various parts of our country, they will offer valuable opinions on our work.

Prime Minister Sihanouk said in his speech at the banquet (full text on page two): "The recent establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Cambodia and China is a very natural confirmation of the fact that there is friendship between our two countries and that we share the common desire to consolidate peace on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Prime Minister Sihanouk warmly recalled that after his and Premier Zhou's mutual visits in 1956, friendly exchanges between Cambodia and China became more frequent. The Prime Minister said, "These exchanges of mutual trust and friendship have brought our relations to a level beyond self-interest."

Prime Minister Sihanouk said, referring to his impression of his first visit to China in 1956, "During that visit, I was deeply impressed by the understanding and sincerity of Chinese politicians towards our country and its policy of strict neutrality." The Prime Minister also said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Cambodia at the end of 1956 made everyone in Cambodia feel that China was very kind to them, treating them with brotherly friendship, respecting their social system and customs, and caring for and helping them on the road to progress.

Prime Minister Sihanouk also said: "Another manifestation of the brotherly relations and complete harmony between our two countries is the generous and unconditional assistance that your country has given us, which helps to develop our economy and thus consolidate our independence." He said that the Cambodian people will never forget this effort made by your great country.

The speeches of Premier Zhou and Prime Minister Sihanouk repeatedly evoked bursts of warm applause. After their speeches, the orchestra played the national anthems of Cambodia and China respectively.

At the banquet, Chinese acrobats performed wonderful programs for the distinguished guests.

    周总理欢宴西哈努克首相
　　致词时指出反帝国主义的洪流已不可抗拒
    据新华社16日讯　国务院周恩来总理今天晚间举行盛大国宴，隆重欢迎柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和由他率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团全体贵宾。
    周恩来总理和西哈努克首相先后在洋溢着一片友好气氛的宴会上讲话，他们一致祝贺中柬两国久已存在的亲戚般的友谊，祝贺两国在最近正式建立了外交关系，祝贺和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的胜利。
    今晚，环绕着常青棕榈的北京饭店宴会大厅里高悬着中柬两国国旗。当西哈努克首相和他的女儿索丽娅·伦赛公主以及其他柬埔寨贵宾步进宴会厅时，乐队奏起欢迎乐曲，贵宾们由周总理陪同，在宴会开始以前举行的酒会上同我国国家和政府领导人一一见面握手。
    出席今晚宴会和酒会作陪的，有贺龙、陈毅、李先念副总理，李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、彭真副委员长，张鼎承检察长，外交部章汉夫、罗贵波副部长，我国国家机关各部门、各人民团体和民主党派的负责人，以及柬埔寨驻北京经济代表团团长杨安和各国驻华使节。
    周恩来总理在宴会上首先致词（全文见第二版）欢迎贵宾。他在叙述了两国友好关系的发展之后，指出：“最近，由于亲王殿下的倡议，我们两国正式建立了外交关系，使两国的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段。当然，中柬友谊的发展并不是没有遇到殖民主义势力的阻挠和破坏的。但是，由于中柬两国政府和人民充分相信中柬友好关系符合两国的切身利益，并且为此作出了不懈的努力，殖民主义势力企图疏远中柬两国的阴谋不得不归于失败。中柬友好关系的顺利发展是中柬两国人民的胜利，也是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的胜利。”
    周总理接着深刻地论述了“东风压倒西风”的国际局势和全世界民族独立运动蓬勃高涨的巨大意义。他说：“维护民族独立、反对殖民主义的民族主义国家，在社会主义国家和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，已经形成为一股巨大的、反对帝国主义的洪流。埃及人民、叙利亚人民、印度尼西亚人民、伊拉克人民、北非洲人民和拉丁美洲人民所取得的一系列伟大的胜利，都说明这股洪流是不可抗拒的。柬埔寨坚持民族独立，反对外来的干涉和压迫，主张各国不分大小一律平等，正是表达了民族主义国家的共同愿望。”周总理指出，帝国主义分子拒绝接受历史的教训，仍然绝望地企图以武力来维持或者恢复他们的殖民统治。美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略就是一个例子。历史的车轮是扭转不了的，西方帝国主义分子的倒行逆施，终将受到历史的惩罚。
    最后周总理表示，希望西哈努克亲王殿下和代表团的朋友们在参观访问我国各地的时候，能对我们的工作提出宝贵的意见。
    西哈努克首相在宴会上的讲话（全文见第二版）中说：“最近柬埔寨和中国之间正常外交关系的建立，乃是对事实的很自然的确认，这个事实就是我们两国之间的友谊和我们为在和平共处五项原则的基础上巩固和平而努力的共同愿望。
    西哈努克首相热情地回顾了他和周总理在1956年相互访问之后，柬中两国之间的友好往来就更加频繁了。首相说，“这些相互信任和友好的往来使得我们的关系已经达到超越利害计较的境地。”
    西哈努克首相在谈到他1956年第一次访问中国的印象时说，“在那次访问期间，中国政治家们对于我国及其所遵守的严格中立的政策的谅解和真诚态度，给了我深刻的印象。”首相还说，1956年年底周恩来总理对柬埔寨的访问，使柬埔寨每个人都感到中国对他们很亲切，以兄弟般的友谊对待他们，尊重他们的社会制度和风俗习惯，关心和帮助他们走上进步的道路。
    西哈努克首相还说：“我们两国间的兄弟关系和完全协调的另一个表现，就是贵国给予我们的慷慨而无条件的援助，这种援助有助于发展我们的经济，从而巩固我们的独立。”他说，柬埔寨人民永远也不会忘记你们伟大的国家所作的这一努力。
    周总理和西哈努克首相的讲话，不断引起一阵阵热烈的掌声。在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏起柬中两国国歌。
    宴会上，中国杂技演员为贵宾们演出了精彩节目。
