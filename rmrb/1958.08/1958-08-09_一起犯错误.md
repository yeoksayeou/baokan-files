    Committing Errors Together
    According to the American magazine "New Republic," on the night that Eisenhower decided to have the US military invade Lebanon, Macmillan delivered a speech on Anglo-American relations at a meeting in London. He said: "It is better to do the wrong thing together than to do the right thing alone." Two days later, British troops also invaded Jordan.
    Macmillan's words are indeed thought-provoking. First of all, it reflects the subtle psychology of the British junior partner in dealing with the so-called Anglo-American interdependence. The British ruling group, due to the lessons of the failed Suez Crisis and the strong pressure of domestic public opinion, was not without concerns about war adventures in the Middle East. However, excessive oil profits and the wishful thinking that relying on joint action with the United States could embolden them, finally made Macmillan blinded by greed and willing to "do the wrong thing together" with the United States.
    Knowingly "wrong," but insisting on making mistakes, this is the incorrigible depravity of imperialist warmongers. The "New Republic" magazine has already revealed the future of this "doing the wrong thing together": "The United States and Britain may have fallen into trouble."

    一起犯错误
    据美国“新共和”杂志报道，在艾森豪威尔决定美军侵入黎巴嫩的那一天晚上，麦克米伦在伦敦一次会议上发表了一篇有关英美关系的谈话。他说：“一起干错误的事情要比单干正确的事情好。”过了两天，英国军队也就侵入了约旦。
    麦克米伦的话的确耐人寻味。首先，它反映了英国小伙伴在对待所谓美英相互依赖问题上的微妙心理。英国统治集团由于侵埃战争失败的教训以及国内舆论的强大压力，对于在中东的战争冒险并不是没有顾虑的。但是，超额的石油利润以及依赖同美国共同行动可以壮胆的侥幸心理，终于使麦克米伦利令智昏，同美国“一起干错误的事”了。
    明知“错误”，却硬要犯错误，这就是帝国主义战争狂人怙恶不悛的劣根性。“新共和”杂志对这种“一起干错误的事”已经道出它的前途：“美国和英国可能已经陷入困境”。
