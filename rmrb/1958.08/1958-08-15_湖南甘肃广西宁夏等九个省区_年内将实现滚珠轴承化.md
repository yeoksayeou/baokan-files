Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Millions of skilled workers in nine provinces and regions across the country, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a surge in manufacturing ball bearings. According to recent statistics from seven provinces—Hebei, Hubei, Shandong, Hunan, Gansu, Yunnan, and Guizhou—and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 405 counties and cities have learned to manufacture various ball bearings. In Hebei Province alone, more than 597,000 sets were manufactured in ten days. Even in remote areas with a weaker industrial base, such as the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, ball bearings have been manufactured.

Participating in this movement are people of all ethnicities, including agricultural cooperative members, workers in factories, repair shops, and handicraft cooperatives, agricultural technology extension station staff, cadres sent to lower levels, government officials, and teachers and students. Based on the methods proposed by the Party committee of fully integrating large factories with small factories, factories with agricultural cooperatives, and cooperatives that know how to manufacture with those that do not, and using the principle of relying mainly on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, manufacturing locally, and promoting locally, they have created a variety of ball bearings made of pig iron, wrought iron, wood, glass, and other materials. For example, workers at the Fucheng County Iron Factory in Hebei changed from using wrought iron to pig iron as raw material and used sand-casting to increase production by more than 400 times. Four agricultural tool factories in the Wudang District of Guiyang City, lacking lathes, power, and engineering technicians, and also lacking steel, insisted on using indigenous methods, replacing machines with manual labor, and wood instead of steel to make ball bearings. The Minle Cooperative in the suburbs of Yinchuan City, Ningxia, used only a pair of pliers, a file, and a grinding wheel to make two types of ball bearings.

After installing ball bearings on transport tools and agricultural implements, work efficiency immediately improved. More than 129,000 agricultural tools in Shandong Province have been equipped with ball bearings. In the Ningxia area, threshing wheat used to require five rollers, ten livestock, and five laborers; now, after installing ball bearings on the rollers, it only requires two laborers and four livestock, increasing production efficiency by one time. In the past, a small cart could push 300 jin (150 kg); after installing ball bearings, it can push 600 jin (300 kg), increasing the speed by one time compared to the past. Some cooperative members said, "With a small cart, pushing is energetic; achieving ball bearing implementation, no matter how heavy, we are not afraid." The effect of installing ball bearings was even more evident in the spring drought resistance in Qilu County, Yunnan. The 90 ball-bearing windmill water pumps, 270 ball-bearing horse-drawn water carts, and 400 ball-bearing large water carts used in this county not only played a timely role in drought resistance but also saved more than 8,600 workdays.

Currently, the Party committees in the aforementioned regions are convening on-site meetings to promote advanced experiences, encourage innovation and invention, and organize factory-cooperative integration and division of labor to ensure the vigorous development of the ball bearing manufacturing movement. Based on the progress of the movement in the aforementioned provinces and regions, Hebei and Shandong provinces will be able to achieve ball bearing implementation on transport tools by the end of August, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Gansu by the end of September, Yunnan by the end of October, and Guangxi and Ningxia will achieve semi-mechanization by the end of the year.

### 湖南甘肃广西宁夏等九个省区　年内将实现滚珠轴承化

　　湖南甘肃广西宁夏等九个省区
　　年内将实现滚珠轴承化
    新华社13日讯　全国又有九个省区的千百万能工巧匠，在党的领导下掀起制造滚珠轴承的热潮。据河北、湖北、山东、湖南、甘肃、云南、贵州七省和广西僮族自治区的最近统计，已有四百零五个县市学会制造各种滚珠轴承。仅河北一省，就在十天中制造了五十九万七千多套。连工业基础较差的云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州、文山僮族苗族自治州等边远地区，都已制造出滚珠轴承。
    参加这一运动的，包括农业社社员，工厂、修配厂、手工业社工人，农业技术推广站工作人员、下放干部、机关干部、学校师生等各族人民。他们根据党委提出的充分采取大厂与小厂相结合、工厂与农业社相结合、会制造的社与不会制造的社相结合的办法，并且运用土法为主、土洋结合、就地取材、就地制造、就地推广方针，创造了生铁、熟铁、木制、玻璃等多种多样的滚珠轴承。例如，河北阜城县铁工厂工人把原来以熟铁为原料改成以生铁为原料，用翻砂铸件，把产量提高了四百多倍。贵阳市乌当区四个农具厂一无车床、二无动力、三无工程技术人员，同时又缺乏钢铁，但工人坚持用土法上马，用手工代替机器，用木材代替钢材制成滚珠轴承。宁夏银川市郊区民乐社只有一把老虎钳、一把锉、一个砂轮就制成两种滚珠。
    运转工具和农具安上滚珠轴承后，工效立即提高。山东省已有十二万九千多件农具安装上了滚珠轴承。宁夏地区过去打一场麦子，要用五个滚子、十匹牲口、五个劳动力；现在在滚子上安了滚珠轴承后，只用两个劳动力，四匹牲口，生产效率提高了一倍。过去一辆小车推三百斤重，安上滚珠轴承后能推六百斤，速度比过去提高一倍。有些社员说：“有了小车子，推着有力气，实现滚珠化，再重也不怕”。安上滚珠轴承的效果，在云南杞麓县春季抗旱中表现得更加明显。这个县使用的九十部滚珠轴承风力水车，二百七十部滚珠马拉水车、四百部滚珠大水车，不仅及时地发挥了抗旱作用，而且节省了八千六百多个工。
    目前，上述地区的党委纷纷召开现场会议，推广先进经验，鼓励创造发明，并组织厂、社结合，分工协作，保证了制造滚珠轴承运动的蓬勃发展。据上述各省区的运动进展情况看，8月底前，河北、山东两省能在运转工具上实现滚珠轴承化，9月底前，湖北、湖南、贵州、甘肃，10月底前，云南，年底之前广西、宁夏都能实现半机械化。
