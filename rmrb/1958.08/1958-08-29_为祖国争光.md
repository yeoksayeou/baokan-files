Striving for Glory for the Motherland
　　Hui Xuan

This summer vacation, more than two hundred college students from worker and peasant backgrounds graduated from the Beijing Mining Institute. The graduation of worker-peasant students in batches is a first in our country's history. This is a victory for the educational policy of higher education serving workers and peasants and implementing the class line.

Workers who were illiterate or semi-literate not long ago have completed sixteen years of ordinary school courses in just eight short years and will become outstanding technical talents and experts on the production front. This was unimaginable in the past. Some bourgeois professors and experts believed that cultivating college students from worker-peasant backgrounds was a "waste." The so-called "waste" boils down to these two meanings: first, workers and peasants are not qualified to study at all; second, even if they are forced into school, they cannot learn well. Facts have provided a powerful answer. Workers and peasants should not only study and can study, but also study well. Students from worker-peasant backgrounds have a high level of awareness. They regard overcoming cultural and technical barriers as important as production tasks, and they fight wherever the leadership directs them. They understand why they are studying, understanding that it is not for personal advancement, but for the entire socialist cause. Therefore, they have unparalleled enthusiasm for learning.

As for saying that worker-peasant students do not learn well, this is an unfounded slander shouted by those who look down on practical knowledge. In fact, worker-peasant students have rich production knowledge. As long as they closely integrate production knowledge with theoretical knowledge and use the learning method of linking theory with practice at any time, they can make creations in their studies. The graduation designs of these students are an example. They broke with superstition, broke the convention of 500 meters for underground power transmission stipulated in books, and created the miracle of 1,000 meters for underground power transmission.

Bourgeois experts and professors despise the working people and practical knowledge, so they can only be blind to the truth, which is what the proverb says, "having eyes but not recognizing Mount Tai." Chairman Mao once said that those who only have book knowledge but have not yet come into contact with practice, or those with little practical experience, should understand their shortcomings and be more humble in their attitude. We advise bourgeois intellectuals who are divorced from production and reality to be more humble, accept ideological transformation, and catch up with the new intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds.

Now, the first batch of college graduates from the Beijing Mining Institute, who have rich production experience and are armed with theory, is a model of the combination of mental and physical labor, and also the beginning of the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses. They are a new type of intellectual, and also ordinary laborers. We can expect that this batch of new intellectuals will win glory for the motherland in the technical revolution and the cultural revolution.

　　为祖国争光
　　惠萱
    今年暑期，北京矿业学院有二百多名工农出身的大学生毕业了。工农学生成批的毕业，这还是我国历史上的第一次。这是高等教育面向工农和贯彻阶级路线的教育方针的胜利。
    不久以前还处于文盲和半文盲状态的工人，在短短的八年中居然学完了普通学校十六年的课程，将成为生产战线上优秀的技术人材和专家，这在过去是不可想像的事情。一些资产阶级的教授、专家认为：培养工农出身的大学生是“浪费”。所谓“浪费”，无非是这两个意思：一是工农根本没有资格学；二是即使勉勉强强让他们进了学校，也不能学好。事实作了有力的回答。工农不仅应当学、能学，而且学得很好。工农出身的学生有很高的自觉，他们把攻克文化、技术关，看成同生产任务一样重要，领导上指到哪里，就打到哪里。他们懂得为什么学习，懂得不是为了个人往上爬，而是为了整个社会主义事业。因此，他们有无比顽强的学习热情。
    至于说工农学生学不好，这是看不起实际知识的人所嚷嚷的无根据的谰言。其实，工农学生有丰富的生产知识，只要把生产知识和理论知识密切结合起来，随时运用理论联系实际的学习方法，就能够在学习中有所创造。这批学生的毕业设计就是一例。他们破除迷信，打破书本上规定的井下送电五百公尺的常规，创造了井下送电一千公尺的奇迹。
    资产阶级的专家教授们轻视劳动人民、轻视实际知识，因而他们只能是真理的盲人，也就是谚语所说的“有眼不识泰山”。毛主席曾经说过，那些只有书本知识但还没有接触实际的人，或者实际经验尚少的人，应当明白自己的缺点，将自己的态度放谦虚一些。我们奉劝脱离生产、脱离实际的资产阶级知识分子要谦虚一些，接受思想改造，赶上工农出身的新知识分子。
    现在北京矿业学院的第一批毕业的具有丰富生产经验又用理论武装起来的大学生，就是脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的榜样，也是工农群众知识化的开始。他们是新型的知识分子，也是普通的劳动者，我们可以预期，这批新知识分子将在技术革命和文化革命中，为祖国争光。
