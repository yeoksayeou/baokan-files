Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th August: Guangzhou has now built many converters, but due to insufficient technical strength, the converters that have been put into production are not operating normally, with intermittent production.

　　To this end, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a steelmaking technology experience exchange meeting, sharing some successful experiences and inviting engineers who understand steelmaking technology to analyze some technical problems encountered by steelmaking units. At the same time, the meeting decided that the Guangzhou No. 1 Heavy Machinery Factory, Guangzhou Shipyard, and Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant Preparatory Office, which currently have normal steelmaking production and strong technical strength, should be used as experimental fields, responsible for rapidly cultivating technical strength for dozens of steelmaking units in the city.

　　At the meeting, Zeng Zhi, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out in his speech that it is very important to establish steelmaking experimental fields, and all relevant steelmaking units should learn well and cooperate in a communist style, ensuring "responsiveness to every request." Zeng Zhi said that although some units currently have some problems in smelting technology, as long as they carry forward the revolutionary spirit of continuous leap forward, these technical problems will be quickly resolved.

　　广州办炼钢试验田
　　加速掌握技术
    新华社广州18日电  广州市目前已经建成许多转炉，但是因为技术力量不足，已投入生产的转炉生产不够正常，时断时续。
    为此，中共广州市委在最近召开了炼钢技术经验交流会议，交流了一些成功的经验，并且请懂炼钢技术的工程师分析了炼钢单位所碰到的一些技术问题。同时，会议决定由目前炼钢生产正常和技术力量较强的广州第一重型机器厂、广州造船厂、广州钢铁厂筹建处三个单位作为试验田，负责为本市几十个炼钢单位迅速培养技术力量。
    会上，中共广州市委书记曾志讲话指出，搞炼钢试验田很重要，各有关炼钢单位应当很好学习，并且要以共产主义的风格搞好协作，做到“有求必应”。曾志说，目前有些单位虽在冶炼技术上存在一些问题，但是只要发扬不断跃进的革命精神，这些技术问题就会很快得到解决。
