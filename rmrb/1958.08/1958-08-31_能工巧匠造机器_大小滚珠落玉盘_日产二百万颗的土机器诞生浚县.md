　　Skilled Craftsmen Build Machines, Large and Small Ball Bearings Fall onto a Jade Plate
    Indigenous Machine Producing 2 Million Ball Bearings Daily Born in Junxian County
    Zhengzhou Dispatch from our newspaper, August 30th (Reporter Fang Huang): In the accelerating movement to achieve full ball bearing implementation in Junxian County, Henan Province, a combined ball bearing manufacturing machine capable of producing 2 million ball bearings daily has been created, increasing efficiency more than a thousandfold compared to manual labor.
    This combined ball bearing manufacturing machine was developed by Wu Qingjie, a worker at the Weixian People's Commune Ball Bearing Factory in Junxian County, with the assistance of factory director Liu Zengwen and all the workers. After more than a month of research and overcoming various difficulties, it was successfully trial-produced on August 16th.
    The combined ball bearing manufacturing machine only requires eight people to operate. Calculated on the basis of fourteen hours of work per day, it can produce more than two million large and small ball bearings daily, which is 1,024 times more efficient than the original method of hand-hammering by three workers, and the quality is also better than hand-hammering. Using this combined ball bearing manufacturing machine to produce ball bearings, in just over half an hour, it can produce the equivalent of eighty days' production for one hundred and twenty workers in this factory. In half a day, it can produce the equivalent of two months' worth of ball bearing production for all eighty-four ball bearing factories in the county.
    The construction of this combined ball bearing manufacturing machine is very simple. It simply combines processes such as cutting material, pressing ball bearing molds, and polishing, and replaces manual labor with machine production. During production, it is only necessary to heat the raw iron through four furnaces with bellows, each fifteen feet long, installed at one end of the machine, and then enter the ball rolling mill. The ball rolling mill is made of two steel rollers of the same length, twenty centimeters long and seven point seven centimeters in diameter, with semi-circular ball bearing molds of one point, two point, and two and a half points. The heated raw iron passes through the ball rolling mill and is immediately pressed into a string of connected ball bearing blanks. Then, it is cut off at the connecting part by an automatic de-capping machine, and finally polished by a steel mill to become steel balls, which can be used after the final step of steel tempering. At the other end of the combined ball bearing manufacturing machine are two large power wheels driven by manpower, which are connected to the steel rollers, de-capping machine, and steel mill.
    Wu Qingjie encountered many difficulties when creating the combined ball bearing manufacturing machine. The first was the lack of machine parts. If these parts were all produced by themselves, it would take a long time, but Wu Qingjie, with the support of the township Party committee and all the workers, finally overcame this difficulty. They picked out various parts suitable for the machine from the scrap steel and iron donated by the masses. For example, when they were installing the ball rolling mill, they lacked gears, and the ball rolling mill would become tight and loose when it rotated. Later, they found a gear from an old noodle pressing machine in the scrap iron and installed it, which solved the problem. They also used iron drilling instead of a lathe, and used string pulling to mark points instead of precise calculators.
    Now, under the leadership of the township Party committee, Wu Qingjie and the workers of this factory are planning to further improve this machine, changing from manual propulsion to power drive. It is estimated that after the improvement, the output can be increased to more than seven point three million large and small ball bearings of various sizes per day. (Attached picture)

　　能工巧匠造机器  大小滚珠落玉盘
    日产二百万颗的土机器诞生浚县
    本报郑州30日电　记者方徨报道：河南省浚县在加速实现全县滚珠轴承化的运动中，创造了一个日产二百万颗滚珠的联合制造滚珠机，比人工提高效率一千多倍。
    这个联合制造滚珠机是浚县卫贤人民公社滚珠轴承厂工人吴清阶，在厂长刘增文和全体工人的帮助下，经过了一个多月的钻研，克服了各种困难，在8月16日试制成功的。
    联合制造滚珠机只需要八个人操作，按每日工作十四小时计算，就可以日产大、小滚珠二百多万颗，比原来用三个工人手砸，要提高工效一千零二十四倍，质量也比手工砸的好。利用这部联合制造滚珠机生产滚珠，半个多小时就能生产出等于这个厂一百二十个工人八十天的生产量，半天时间，就可以生产出等于全县八十四座滚珠轴承厂两个月的滚珠生产量。
    这部联合制造滚珠机的制造很简单，它只是把截料压滚珠模子、磨光等工序都联合在一起，并且用机器生产代替了人工的劳动。在生产时，只需要将元铁通过安装在机器一端的、长一丈五尺的四座带有风箱的烘炉煆烧以后，再进入轧珠磙。轧珠磙是用两个同样长二十公分，直径七点七公分的钢磙做成的，磙上有一分、二分、二分半三种半圆形的滚珠模。烧红的元铁通过轧珠磙，立刻就被压成一串连在一起的滚珠粗坯，然后再通过自动脱帽机切断相连部分，最后经过钢磨磨光以后，就成为钢珠，再经过最后一道手续——焖钢以后，就可以使用了。在联合制造滚珠机的另端是用人力推动的两个大动力轮，与钢磙、脱帽机、钢磨相连。
    吴清阶创造联合制造滚珠机时，遇到了许多困难。首先是机器零件不足。这些零件如果都靠自己生产的话，要花很长的时间，但吴清阶在乡党委和全体工人的支持下，终于克服这个困难。他们从群众捐献的废钢烂铁中，拣出了各种合乎机器需要的零件。如他们在安装轧珠磙时，缺少牙轮，轧珠磙转动时就忽紧忽松，后来他们从废铁中找到了一个旧压面条机上的牙轮，安装上去，才解决了这个困难。他们还用钻铁代替了旋床，用扯线划点的办法，代替了精确的计算器。
    现在吴清阶和这个厂的工人在乡党委领导下，还计划进一步改良这个机器，把人工推动改为动力带动，预计改良以后，产量还可以提高到日产各种大、小滚珠七百三十多万颗。（附图片）
