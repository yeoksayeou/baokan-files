Small Information

Since the start of the socialist Great Leap Forward, especially after the People's Daily published the editorial "Collect Folk Songs Nationwide on a Large Scale," folk literature publications have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Books are printed in cities, and books are also printed in the countryside; the central and provincial/municipal authorities print books, and the prefectures and counties/townships print books, as do factories and mines, and cooperatives. The Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory published "Songs of the Great Leap Forward," and a cooperative of 4,000 people in Tumote Banner, Inner Mongolia, published three collections of folk songs in a very short period. The Weiqu Agricultural Cooperative in Chang'an County, Shaanxi, compiled and printed the songbook "100 Leap Forward Folk Songs" in just a few days. Hubei Province (including Wuhan City) published a total of 225 song collections; Anhui Province, with only three cities and forty counties, published 124 song collections.

The rapid development of folk literature publishing is inseparable from the Party's mass line. Under the direct leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, conventional methods were broken, and the mass line of editing and publishing work was implemented, putting forward slogans such as "Party committee takes the lead, everyone gets involved" and "every township compiles books, every factory compiles books." Publishing houses used methods such as "editors going to the countryside, compiling books on site" and "local compilation, publishing house publication" to solve the problems of insufficient editing force and lack of manuscripts; they used small formats and low prices to meet the purchasing power of readers and satisfy the needs of the masses. Xinhua Bookstore moved its distribution section to the publishing house to strengthen the connection between publishing and distribution, enabling books to be quickly delivered to the vast rural readers. This series of new measures greatly developed the publishing work of folk literature. The Jiangsu Literature and Art Publishing House originally planned to compile only three kinds of folk literature anthologies before next year's National Day. As a result, in April and May alone, 57 kinds of folk song collections were compiled. The People's Literature Publishing House, the Writers Publishing House, and the Popular Literature and Art Publishing House, in order to dedicate gifts to the Party, worked hard for five days and nights to publish 88 kinds of books, including more than 20 kinds of folk literature works such as folk songs and clapper talk.

Under the guidance of the general line of more, faster, better, and more economical, folk literature publications are not only numerous but also of good quality. Collections such as "Selected Rural Great Leap Forward Ballads," "Selected Industrial and Mining Great Leap Forward Ballads" compiled by the Chinese Folk Literature Research Association, and folk song collections compiled by various provinces and cities have all maintained a certain level of quality. Most importantly, they are compiled quickly and published quickly, and can timely cooperate with the central tasks, supply propaganda needs, and better achieve the purpose of publications serving politics. To promote technical revolution, ballad collections about technical revolution were published immediately; to promote cultural revolution, ballad collections about cultural revolution were published immediately.

Since the founding of the country, folk literature publishing work has achieved great results under the Party's close care. According to very incomplete statistics, from October 1949 to March 1958, a total of 654 kinds of Han Chinese folk literature books were published; 89 kinds of minority folk literature books translated into Chinese; and although there are no specific statistics on the number of indigenous folk literature books published in minority languages ​​and translated Han Chinese folk literature books, it can be affirmed that there are many. A good number of large-scale Mongolian epics, such as "Gesar" and "Jangar," have been published.

### 民间文艺作品  出得又多又快

    民间文艺作品  出得又多又快
    社会主义大跃进开始以来，特别在人民日报“大规模地搜集全国民歌”的社论发表之后，民间文学的出版物真像雨后春笋。城里印书，乡里也印书；中央和省、市印书，专区和县、乡印书，厂矿和合作社也印书。上海第二纺织机械厂出版了“大跃进之歌”，内蒙古土默特旗一个四千人的合作社很短期间出版了三本民歌集，陕西长安县韦曲农业社，只用几天时间就自编自印了歌谣集“跃进民歌一百首”。湖北省（包括武汉市）共出版歌谣集二百二十五种；安徽省仅只三个市四十个县，就出版歌谣集一百二十四种。
    民间文学出版事业的迅速发展，是和党的群众路线分不开的。江苏省在省委的直接领导下，打破了常规，贯彻了编辑出版工作的群众路线，提出“党委挂帅，人人动手”，“乡乡编书，厂厂编书”等口号。出版社用“编辑下乡，现场编书”、“地方编书，出版社出版”等办法，解决了编辑力量不足和稿源缺乏问题；用小开本、低价钱，照读者的购买力，满足群众的要求，新华书店把发行科搬到出版社办公，加强了出版、发行之间的联系，使书籍能够迅速送到广大农村读者手里。这一系列的新措施，使民间文学的出版工作得以大大发展。江苏文艺出版社在明年国庆节前，本来只计划编三种民间文学选集，这样一来，光是4、5月份就编成了民歌集五十七种。人民文学出版社、作家出版社、通俗文艺出版社，为了向党献礼，苦战五昼夜，出版了八十八种书，其中就有民歌、快板等二十几种民间文学作品。
    在多、快、好、省的方针指导下，民间文学的出版物，不仅多，而且好。像中国民间文艺研究会编的“农村大跃进歌谣选”、“工矿大跃进歌谣选”和各省、市编选的民歌集，都保持了一定的质量水平。而最重要的是编得快，出得快，能及时配合中心任务，供应宣传需要，更好地达到出版物为政治服务的目的。要宣传技术革命，马上出版了关于技术革命的歌谣集；要宣传文化革命，马上出版了文化革命的歌谣集。
    建国以来，民间文学的出版工作，在党的亲切关怀下，取得了很大成绩。据极不完全的统计，从1949年10月到1958年3月，共出汉族民间文学书籍六百五十四种；汉译的少数民族民间文学书籍八十九种；用少数民族文字出版的本民族民间文学书籍和翻译的汉族民间文学书籍，虽没有具体统计，但可以肯定为数不少。单是蒙古族的大型史诗，如“格斯尔特”、“江格尔”等，就出版了好多种。
