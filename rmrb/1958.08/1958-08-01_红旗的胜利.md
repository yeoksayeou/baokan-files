    The Victory of the Red Flag
    Li Zi
    Any work, once the red flag is planted, will achieve victory. The completion of the locomotive design for the 3,000-horsepower free-piston gas turbine unit by the teachers and students of two departments of Tsinghua University's Department of Power Engineering is proof of this. This achievement should be called a miracle.
    The ninety-nine teachers and students of the two departments of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University, with an average age of less than twenty-four, most of whom only had book knowledge and little practical experience, bravely undertook the design of one of the world's most advanced locomotives. This is a great achievement of the ideological liberation of the rectification movement, and a victory of putting politics in command and raising the red flag.
    Among the young teachers and students of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University, there are Communist Party members, and there is also the support and guidance of the Party branch. With politics in command and the red flag raised, fifteen days of hard work completed the design workload of two to three years. The unimaginable task was completed unexpectedly victoriously.
    The Party branch's putting politics in command mainly grasped two points: first, clarifying the direction and being realistic; second, giving full play to collective strength and carrying forward revolutionary vigor. When the teachers and students of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University were designing, the first problem they encountered was a lack of experience and data, and they had different opinions on studying the few drawings from the Soviet Union. After discovering this situation, the Party branch pointed out that they must be realistic and learn humbly; learn from the existing experience of the Soviet Union, learn from fraternal schools and factories, and learn from experienced technicians and veteran workers. This made up for their weakness of lacking experience. Under such a premise, they carried out creative design based on China's actual conditions such as technology and resources. In the process of design, they eliminated unrealistic ideas such as arrogance, innovation for the sake of innovation, and reaching for the sky, which started from bourgeois individualism, and went in the right direction.
    Secondly, under the leadership of the Party branch, the teachers and students of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University gave full play to their collective strength and carried forward revolutionary vigor. The young men did not ask how hot the weather was or how heavy the task was, they cooperated wholeheartedly and went all out. They did not allow a single mistake on the drawings. If there was a mistake, they redrew it, whether it was once, twice, or three times. They worked hard and practically, persisting in working for more than ten hours a day, drenched in sweat. When they encountered difficulties, they held "Zhuge Liang meetings," where everyone discussed and solved the problems. Here, we see the communist style, daring to think and act, and relying on the collective.
    The success of the teachers and students of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University in designing the free-piston gas turbine unit locomotive proves once again that with the leadership of the Party, with the wisdom of the collective, learning humbly, and going all out, anything that mankind can do, we can do, and there is nothing we cannot do!

    红旗的胜利
    李梓
    任何工作，一插上红旗，就会得到胜利。清华大学动力系两个专业的师生完成了三千马力自由活塞——燃气轮机机组的机车设计工作就是明证。这一成就应当说是一个奇迹。
    清华大学动力系两个专业的九十九位教师、学生，平均年龄不满二十四岁，绝大部分只有书本知识，没有什么实际经验，却勇敢地担当起设计一种世界上最先进的火车头；这是整风运动解放思想的伟大成果，又是政治挂帅、树起红旗的胜利。
    在清华大学动力系年青的师生中，有共产党员；并且有党支部的支持和引导。政治挂了帅，红旗树起了，于是十五天的苦战，干完了两三年的设计工作量。不可想像的任务，出人意料地胜利完成了。
    党支部的政治挂帅，主要掌握了两点：一是明确方向，实事求是；二是发挥集体力量，发扬革命干劲。清华大学动力系师生在设计时，首先碰到的是没有经验，缺乏资料，并且对学习苏联的仅有几张图纸有着不同的意见，党支部发现这一情况后，指明了必须实事求是地虚心学习。向苏联的已有经验学习，向兄弟学校和工厂学习，向有经验的技术人员和老工人学习。这样就补足了他们缺乏经验的弱点。在这样的前提条件下，他们再根据中国的技术、资源等实际条件，进行创造性的设计。他们在设计过程中，就排除了从资产阶级个人主义出发的狂妄自大、标新立异、好高鹜远等不切实际的思想，走对了方向。
    其次，清华大学动力系的师生，在党支部的领导下，发挥了集体力量，发扬了革命干劲。小伙子们不问天气有多热，不问任务有多重，同心协作，全力以赴。他们不让图纸上有一点错误，错了就再画，不管是一次是两次是三次。他们实干苦干，每天汗流浃背地坚持工作十几小时。他们碰到困难，就开“诸葛亮会”，大家讨论，大家解决。在这里，我们看到了共产主义的风格，敢想敢作，而又依靠集体。
    清华大学动力系师生设计自由活塞——燃气轮机机组的机车成功再次证明，有了党的领导，有了集体的智慧，虚心学习，鼓足干劲，凡是人类能够做的事，我们都能够做，没有什么事我们不能够做的！
