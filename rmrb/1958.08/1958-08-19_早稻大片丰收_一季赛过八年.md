Early Rice Bumper Harvest: One Season Surpasses Eight Years
　　Hunan increases production by 9.1 billion catties, with an average yield of 653 catties per mu.
　　Jiangxi increases production by 8.5 billion catties, with an average yield of 580 catties per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 17th: Hunan Province has completed the harvest of 20.4 million mu of early rice. A total of 13.3211 billion catties of dry grain were harvested, with an average yield of 653 catties per mu. The total output of early rice this year increased by 9.165 billion catties compared to the total output of 4.156 billion catties last year, an increase of 220.52%. The average yield per mu of early rice this year increased by 75.07% compared to the average yield of 373 catties per mu last year. The increase in early rice production this season alone is more than the total increase of 9.111 billion catties achieved annually from 1950 to 1957 on top of the previous year's output, by 54 million catties.

The characteristics of Hunan's bumper harvest of early rice are high-speed and large-area balanced production increase. Sixteen counties and cities in the province achieved an average yield of 800 to over 1,000 catties per mu. There are 272 townships with yields of over 1,000 catties per mu. There are 4,070 cooperatives with yields of over 1,000 catties per mu. There are 2,532,002 mu of land with yields of over 1,000 catties.

Hunan has a complex terrain, with vast mountainous and hilly areas, as well as the plain known as the eight-hundred-li Dongting Lake area. Due to the long-term influence of the small-scale peasant economy, there were various pessimistic views about the rapid development of agricultural production. People in the mountainous areas said that the temperature in the mountains was low and the season was late, "It has always been low-yielding, and the plains are the only places to see 1,000 catties!" People in the hilly areas said that the hilly areas had already increased production a lot in recent years, the sources of fertilizer were exhausted, and the potential was not great. In some high-yielding areas, the idea of "reaching the peak of production" was particularly prevalent. In the lake area, it was believed that annual dike construction and flood prevention, many fields, and a shortage of labor made increasing production difficult. Many people even believed that large-scale production increases required waiting for mechanization and relying on chemical fertilizers. Some even believed in the so-called "law of diminishing returns on land" of bourgeois scholars and dared not imagine a large-scale increase in agricultural production. However, the facts completely negate these erroneous views. For example, in the mountainous areas, nine of the sixteen counties and cities in the province with yields of over 800 catties per mu are located in the mountainous areas. In the Changde area, which is located in the lake area, this year's waterlogging damage was more severe than in any previous year, but now each mu has yielded 715 catties of dry grain, an increase of 1.74 times compared to last year. In Liling County in the hilly area, many people thought that production had almost reached its limit, but this year, more than 480,000 mu of early rice yielded an average of 1,093 catties of dry grain per mu, an increase of 1.5 times compared to last year. The above facts show that how daring people are determines how productive the land is. Although agricultural production is directly affected by natural conditions, it is by no means the decisive factor. As long as the enormous role of people is fully brought into play, any difficulties and disasters can be overcome.

This year, under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, all localities have focused on several major links, such as water conservancy, fertilizer, deep plowing, close planting, advancing the season, selecting good varieties, field management, and tool reform, boldly mobilized the masses, worked hard, and persevered to the end. In implementing these measures, cadres participated in labor and planted experimental fields, which enabled them to better implement various policies and production increase measures specifically and quickly among the masses, which played a significant role in ensuring the large-scale balanced production increase of early rice this year.

The fact of the bumper harvest of early rice has further encouraged the people of the province to strive for a greater bumper harvest of late rice. Currently, a socialist labor competition is being carried out between counties, townships, cooperatives, teams, and individuals.

This newspaper reports that, according to Jiangxi Daily, Jiangxi Province's 24.94 million mu of early rice have all been harvested by early August, with a total output of 14.48 billion catties, an increase of 8.58 billion catties compared to last year, or an increase of 145.4%. The average yield per mu reached 580 catties. The increased output of early rice this season alone is more than the total increase of 6.25 billion catties achieved annually from 1950 to 1957 on top of the previous year's output, by 2.33 billion catties.

This year's early rice production in Jiangxi Province, plus 500 million catties of spring-ripening crops, brings the total output of spring and summer grain crops in the province to 14.98 billion catties. Based on a population of 18.4 million in urban and rural areas, the average per capita grain possession is 814 catties and one tael. Based on a rural population of 16 million, the average per capita grain possession is 936 catties and three taels.

Twelve counties in the province have exceeded the National Agricultural Development Program's grain target of 800 catties per mu, including Xingzi, Nanchang, Pingxiang, Yichun, Boyang, Leping, Guangfeng, Ganxian, Nankang, Linchuan, Nancheng, and Ruichang. There are 331 townships in the province with yields of 800 to 1,000 catties per mu, and 97 townships with yields of 1,000 to 1,500 catties per mu. There are 2,745 cooperatives with yields of 800 to 1,000 catties per mu, 670 cooperatives with yields of 1,000 to 1,500 catties per mu, and one cooperative with yields of 1,500 to 2,000 catties per mu. There are 2.45 million mu of high-yielding fields in the province with yields of 800 to 1,000 catties per mu, and 1.1 million mu of extra-high-yielding fields with yields of 1,000 to 3,000 catties, accounting for 14.4% of the province's early rice area. There are 200 mu with yields of 3,000 to 7,000 catties, and individual higher-yielding fields have yields as high as 9,195 catties per mu, approaching the 10,000-catty mark.

This year, some areas of Jiangxi suffered from floods, with more than 4.2 million mu of fields being flooded. Some areas also experienced little rainfall, and 5.5 million mu were severely threatened by drought or have already been affected by drought. However, thanks to the hard work and courageous rescue efforts of all cadres and the masses, early rice still achieved a province-wide bumper harvest.

The unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice has liberated thinking, broken superstitions, and affirmed the important experiences of vigorously promoting the conversion of one crop to two crops, intercropping to continuous cropping, sparse planting to close planting, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and field management based on vigorously developing water conservancy and increasing fertilizer input. Now, rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers in Jiangxi Province, after the unprecedented increase in early rice production, are boosting their morale and striving for a greater bumper harvest of late rice and late autumn crops, so that the total grain output of the province this year will reach 28.8 billion to 30 billion catties, with an average yield of over 800 catties per mu, achieving the grain target of the National Agricultural Development Program in one year.

### 早稻大片丰收　一季赛过八年

    ·湖南·江西·
    早稻大片丰收　一季赛过八年
　　湖南增产91亿斤，平均亩产653斤
　　江西增产85亿斤，平均亩产580斤
    据新华社长沙17日电　湖南省二千零四十万亩早稻已经收完。共收干谷一百三十三亿二千一百万斤，平均亩产六百五十三斤。今年早稻总产量比去年早稻总产量四十一亿五千六百万斤增产九十一亿六千五百万斤，即增产220.52％。今年早稻平均亩产比去年早稻平均亩产三百七十三斤，增产75.07％。今年早稻一季增产就比1950年至1957年八年间，每年在上年度产量的基础上增产的总和九十一亿一千一百万斤还多五千四百万斤。
    湖南早稻大丰收的特点是高速度的、大面积的平衡增产。全省共出现了十六个平均亩产八百至一千多斤的县市。有二百七十二个亩产一千斤以上的乡。有四千零七十个亩产一千斤以上的社。有二百五十三万二千零二亩田产量在一千斤以上。
    湖南地形复杂。有广大的山区和丘陵地区，还有素称八百里洞庭湖区平原。由于长时期来受小农经济的影响，人们对迅速发展农业生产存在着各种悲观论调。山区的人，说山区气温低，季节迟，“自古是低产，千斤只有看平原！”丘陵地带的人，就说丘陵区几年来已经增产不少，肥源挖尽，潜力不大。特别是一些高产地区，“增产到顶”的思想尤为普遍；在滨湖地区，则认为每年修堤防汛，田多劳力缺，增产困难多，更有不少的人则认为要大增产就要等待机械化，要靠化学肥料。甚至有的还相信资产阶级学者的所谓“土地收入递减规律”，对农业大增产更是不敢想像。但是事实却完全否定了这些错误的看法。例如山区，全省亩产八百斤以上的十六个县市中，处在山区的就有九个县；滨湖地区的常德专区，今年渍水为害比任何一年都重，现在每亩收了七百一十五斤干谷，较去年增长一点七四倍；丘陵地带的醴陵县，好些人认为增产已经差不多了，但是，今年四十八万多亩早稻，平均每亩收干谷一千零九十三斤，较去年增产一倍半。以上事实说明，人有多大的胆，地有多大的产。农业生产虽然直接受自然条件的影响，但是，它绝不是决定的因素，只要充分地发挥人的巨大作用，任何困难和任何灾害都是能够战胜的。
    今年，在各级党委大力领导下，各地都突出地抓着水利、肥料、深耕、密植、提早季节、选用良种、田间管理、工具改革等几个主要环节，放手发动群众，大干特干，坚持到底。在贯彻执行这些措施中，由于干部参加劳动种试验田，这样就能更好地把各项政策和各项增产措施，具体地迅速地贯彻到群众中去，对保证今年早稻大面积平衡增产起了很大的作用。
    早稻大丰收的事实，更加鼓舞了全省人民争取晚稻更大的丰收运动，目前，县与县、乡与乡、社与社、队与队、人与人之间正在开展社会主义劳动竞赛运动。
    本报讯　据江西日报消息：江西省二千四百九十四万亩早稻，已经在8月上旬全部收割完毕，总产量达到一百四十四亿八千万斤，比去年增产八十五亿八千万斤，即增产145.4％。每亩平均产量达到五百八十斤。仅今年早稻一季增加的产量，比1950年至1957年八年间每年在上年度产量的基础上增产的总和六十二亿五千万斤，还多二十三亿三千万斤。
    江西省今年早稻的产量再加上春熟作物五亿斤，全省春夏粮食作物总产量共达一百四十九亿八千万斤。按城乡一千八百四十万人口计算，每人平均有粮食八百一十四斤一两。如以一千六百万农村人口计算，每人平均有粮食九百三十六斤三两。
    全省一季早稻超过全国农业发展纲要粮食指标亩产八百斤以上的县有星子、南昌、萍乡、宜春、波阳、乐平、广丰、赣县、南康、临川、南城、瑞昌等十二个县。全省亩产八百斤至一千斤的乡有三百三十一个，一千斤至一千五百斤的乡有九十七个；亩产八百斤至一千斤的社二千七百四十五个，一千斤至一千五百斤的社六百七十个，一千五百斤至二千斤的社一个。全省亩产八百斤至一千斤的丰产田有二百四十五万亩，千斤以上三千斤以下的高额丰产田有一百一十万亩，占全省早稻面积的14.4％。三千斤至七千斤的二百亩，个别更高的丰产田，亩产高达九千一百九十五斤，逼近万斤大关。
    今年江西部分地区遭了水灾，被洪水淹田四百二十余万亩，一部分地区又很少下雨，有五百五十万亩受到严重的旱灾威胁或已经受旱成灾；但经全体干部和广大群众的艰苦工作，奋勇抢救，早稻仍然获得了全省性的大丰收。
    由于早稻的空前大丰收，解放了思想，破除了迷信，肯定了在大力搞好水利，大量增加肥料的基础上，积极推行一季改双季、间作改连作、稀植改密植、深耕细作和田间管理等重要经验。现在江西全省农村干部和广大农民群众，在早稻空前增产后，鼓起更大干劲，力争晚稻和晚秋作物更大丰收，要使今年全省粮食总产量达到二百八十八亿至三百亿斤，平均亩产八百斤以上，一年实现全国农业发展纲要粮食指标。（附图片）
