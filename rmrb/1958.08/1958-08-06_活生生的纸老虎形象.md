    A Vivid Image of a Paper Tiger
    The People's Daily published a photo on July 28th of American invading troops captured by the people's armed forces in Beirut, titled "Paper Tigers Putting on Their Best Performance in Beirut." Look at those invaders wearing neat uniforms and hard helmets, yet bowing their heads and raising their hands; the image of the paper tiger is truly obvious!
    The two photos published on July 26th of the people of Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, demonstrating at the Qiaotou in Shenzhen are also excellent. Seeing the astonished and tongue-tied appearance of the British police, people seem to see the imperialism's fear of the power of the vast peace-loving people.
    These photos make the people feel invigorated and proud. Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications Zhou Jianguo

    活生生的纸老虎形象
    7月28日人民日报登载了美国侵略军在黎巴嫩首都被人民武装俘虏的一张照片，标题是“纸老虎在贝鲁特演出拿手好戏”。看那侵略者穿着整齐的军装，坚硬的钢盔戴在头上，却低着头，举着手，纸老虎的形象真是再明显不过了！
    7月26日登的广东宝安县人民在深圳桥头举行示威的两张照片也很好。看到英方警察那副吃惊、吐舌的样子，人们仿佛看到了帝国主义对于广大爱好和平的人民力量的畏惧。
    这些照片使人民感到振奋和自豪。　北京邮电学院　周建国
