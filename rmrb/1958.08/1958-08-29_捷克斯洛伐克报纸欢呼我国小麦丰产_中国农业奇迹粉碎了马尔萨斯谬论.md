Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 28th. The Czechoslovak newspaper "Agricultural News" published an article on the front page today titled "Chinese Farmers' Wheat Satellites." The article emphasized that the news of China's bumper wheat harvest, in terms of its significance to humanity, can be compared to the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite last year.

The newspaper mentioned the highest record of wheat yield per unit area achieved by the "Heping" Agricultural Cooperative in Xiping County, Henan Province this year, and introduced in detail the process of the cooperative creating the record. The newspaper pointed out that the highest record of wheat yield per unit area created by the "Heping" Agricultural Cooperative is almost ten times the highest record of wheat yield per unit area in Czechoslovakia.

The newspaper wrote that the news of the "Heping" Agricultural Cooperative creating a record wheat harvest seemed impossible and fanciful at first glance. Only after verifying with the Chinese Embassy in Czechoslovakia and talking with Yang Xiandong, the head of the Chinese agricultural science delegation currently visiting Czechoslovakia, did the editors believe that the news was indeed true.

"Agricultural News" listed the figures of wheat and rice bumper harvests that China is now continuing to achieve. The newspaper pointed out that the bumper harvest achievements made by Chinese farmers have overturned the so-called idealist theory of diminishing returns of land products, and proved to Malthus and his followers that their theory is wrong. In addition, these achievements have also shaken the so-called "biological boundary" theory, thereby giving Czechoslovakia the prospect of achieving higher yields per unit area.

The newspaper wrote that it is no accident that these world records of unit area yield were created in China. The newspaper emphasized that the Chinese people are giving full play to their initiative, and the victory of the socialist revolution and the emancipation of the people's minds have led to a great leap forward in social productivity.

"Red Righteousness News" today published on the front page the news of the early rice bumper harvest record created by the Jian Guo No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Macheng County, Hubei Province, and published a photo of four children jumping on the dense early rice in the paddy field where the bumper harvest record was created.

    捷克斯洛伐克报纸欢呼我国小麦丰产
    中国农业奇迹粉碎了马尔萨斯谬论
    新华社布拉格28日电　捷克斯洛伐克“农业报”今天在第一版发表了一篇题为“中国农民的小麦卫星”的文章。文章强调说，中国小麦丰收的新闻就其对人类的意义来说，可以同去年苏联发射第一颗人造卫星的新闻相比。
    这家报纸谈到了中国河南省西平县“和平”农业社今年达到的小麦单位面积产量的最高纪录，并且详细介绍了这个合作社创造纪录的经过。报纸指出，“和平”农业社创造的小麦单位面积产量最高纪录几乎等于捷克斯洛伐克小麦单位面积产量最高纪录的十倍。
    报纸写道，对于“和平”农业社创造小麦丰产纪录的消息乍一听来似乎是不可能的，是想入非非的。只是在向中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使馆进行了核对并且同目前正在捷克斯洛伐克访问的中国农业科学代表团团长杨显东谈话以后，编者才相信这个新闻是确实的。
    “农业报”列举了中国现在正在继续取得的小麦和水稻丰产的数字。报纸指出，中国农民取得的丰产成就推翻了所谓土地产品递减的唯心主义理论，并且向马尔萨斯及其信徒证明了他们的理论是错误的。此外，这些成就也使所谓“生物边线”的理论发生动摇，从而也使捷克斯洛伐克有了取得更高的单位面积产量的前景。
    这家报纸写道，这些单位面积产量的世界纪录在中国创造，并不是偶然的事。报纸强调说，中国人民正在发挥高度的主动性，社会主义革命的胜利和人民的思想解放使得社会生产力有了大跃进。
    “红色权利报”今天在第一版刊载了湖北省麻城县建国第一农业社所创造的早稻丰产纪录的消息，并且刊载了四个小孩站在创造丰产纪录的那块稻田的稠密的早稻上跳跃的照片。
