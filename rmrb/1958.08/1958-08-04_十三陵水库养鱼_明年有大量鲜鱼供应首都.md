Fish Farming in the Ming Tombs Reservoir
A Large Supply of Fresh Fish for the Capital Next Year

The staff of the Kunming Lake Fish Breeding Farm under the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Gardens have released 300,000 fish fry into the Ming Tombs Reservoir in the past three days.

The released fish fry include silver carp, bighead carp, grass carp, black carp, and carp.

These fish fry were transported from Hankou. In May of this year, even during the reservoir's construction, the staff of the Kunming Lake Fish Farm took various technical measures to strengthen cultivation efforts. After more than two months of cultivation, these fish fry have grown to two or three inches in length.

According to normal development, each of the 300,000 released fish fry will grow to two catties by the autumn of next year, providing 600,000 catties of fresh fish for the capital.

It is reported that another batch of fish fry is planned to be released this autumn. (Xinhua News Agency)

    十三陵水库养鱼
    明年有大量鲜鱼供应首都
    北京市园林局昆明湖鱼种场的职工，在过去的三天里已经把三十万条鱼苗放养在十三陵水库里。
    放养的鱼苗中，有鲢鱼、鳙鱼、草鱼、青鱼和鲤鱼等。
    这些鱼苗是从汉口运来的。今年5月，还在水库建设期间，昆明湖鱼场职工就采取各种技术措施加强培养工作。经过两个多月的培养，这些鱼苗已长到二、三寸长。
    放养的三十万条鱼苗，按照通常发育情况，明年秋季每条鱼即可成长到二斤，将为首都提供六十万斤鲜鱼。
    据悉今年秋季还准备再继续放养一批鱼种。　（新华社）
