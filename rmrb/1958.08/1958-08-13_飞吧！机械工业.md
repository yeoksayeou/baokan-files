Fly! Mechanical Industry

　　In the course of the great development of the mechanical industry, people have encountered two prominent difficulties: one is the lack of technical equipment. The heavy machinery needed for mechanical manufacturing is far from meeting the requirements of production; the other is the lack of metal materials, especially steel materials. The steel materials needed for mechanical manufacturing are far from meeting the needs of production. This is a major contradiction.

　　Regarding the first difficulty, people have already found a solution, which is the "ants gnawing at bones" method published in this newspaper yesterday. Generally speaking, bones are relatively difficult to gnaw, but they can be gnawed down when many ants gnaw together.

　　Regarding the second difficulty, a solution has now been found. This is the use of cement instead of steel to manufacture the main components of machine tools in Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places, as published in this newspaper today. Generally speaking, modern machines are always made of steel. Without enough steel, it is difficult to imagine producing machines. However, the facts have broken this assumption. In order to develop the mechanical industry, people have elevated cement to the status of steel. In this way, the steel originally used on one machine tool can be turned into dozens of machine tools.

　　Ants gnawing at bones plus cement-made machines are two major innovations in China's mechanical industry. With this creative experience, our mechanical industry can take off, and we can quickly equip machine tool factories everywhere in a very short time.

　　飞吧！机械工业
    在机械工业大发展的途程中，人们遇到了两个突出的困难：一个是技术设备不足，机械制造上需要的重型机器远远不能适应生产的要求；另一个是金属材料特别是钢铁材料不足，机械制造上需要的钢铁材料远远不能满足生产的需要，这是一个很大的矛盾。
    关于第一个困难，人们已经找到了解决的办法，这就是本报昨天刊登的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，一般说骨头是比较难啃的，由于许多蚂蚁一齐去啃也就啃下来了。
    关于第二个困难，现在也找到了解决办法，这就是本报今天刊登的重庆、西安等地用水泥代替钢材制造机床的主要部件。一般说，近代化的机器总是钢铁制成的，没有足够的钢铁，很难想像生产出机器来。事实却打破了这种设想。为了发展机械工业，人们把水泥提升到钢铁地位。这样，原来用在一台机床上的钢铁，就可以变成几十台机床了。
    蚂蚁啃骨头加上水泥造机器，是我国机械工业上的两个重大创举。有了这个创造性的经验，我们的机械工业就可以展翅高飞了，我们就可以在很短的时间把各地的机床厂很快装备起来了。
