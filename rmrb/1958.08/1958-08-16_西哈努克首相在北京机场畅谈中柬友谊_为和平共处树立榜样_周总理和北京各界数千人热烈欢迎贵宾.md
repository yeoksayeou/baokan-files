Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk said upon arriving in Beijing this afternoon that he firmly believes Cambodia can coexist confidently with its neighbor, China, and cooperate harmoniously as brothers on the road to peace and common prosperity.

Prime Minister Sihanouk and the entire Cambodian Royal National Delegation were warmly welcomed by Premier Zhou Enlai and thousands of people from all walks of life in Beijing at the airport. In a speech at the airport, the Prime Minister enthusiastically praised the traditional friendship between Cambodia and China, emphasizing that this friendship has never been mixed with mutual interference in internal affairs, and emphasizing that the Bandung Conference has further developed the friendly relations between the two countries. He said that today the relationship between Cambodia and China can truly be called a brotherly relationship.

Prime Minister Sihanouk said that he hopes the friendship between Cambodia and China can become a model for peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. The Prime Minister also mentioned that the Chinese government strictly adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with Cambodia and provides unconditional economic assistance to Cambodia. He expressed his gratitude for the Chinese government's position and their assistance.

Today, the national flags of China and Cambodia fluttered in the wind at Beijing Airport. When the special plane carrying the distinguished guests slowly landed at 4:00 p.m., a burst of warm applause and cheers erupted from the welcoming crowd standing in the airport under the scorching sun. Then, the band played the national anthems of the two countries, and Prime Minister Sihanouk, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor. All the distinguished guests received flowers presented to them by the capital's Young Pioneers.

Today, Vice Premiers He Long, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties, as well as officials from the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China and envoys from various countries to China, all came to the airport to welcome the distinguished Cambodian guests.

Before Prime Minister Sihanouk's speech, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech on behalf of the Chinese government and people to warmly welcome the distinguished guests. Premier Zhou called the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia and Prime Minister Sihanouk's second visit to China "two joyous events," and believed that this shows that the traditional friendly relations between China and Cambodia have opened a new page, and also marks the consolidation and victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Premier Zhou said that this visit to China by Prince Sihanouk is precisely at a time when the situation in the Middle East is seriously threatening world peace. We are very happy to have this opportunity to exchange views with Prince Sihanouk on the current international situation in order to further strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia in maintaining world peace.

Finally, as Prime Minister Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai slowly walked in front of the welcoming crowd, the enthusiastic people of Beijing kept cheering for the friendship between China and Cambodia, and many young women stepped out of the welcoming line to give bouquets of flowers to the distinguished guests.

The distinguished guests arrived in Beijing from Kunming today, accompanied by Yang An, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to Beijing, and Yu Peiwen, director of the Protocol Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    西哈努克首相说，他希望柬中两国的友谊能够成为不同制度国家和平共处的榜样。首相还谈到了中国政府对柬埔寨严格地遵守着和平共处五项原则，并且给柬埔寨提供无条件的经济援助。他对中国政府的立场和对他们的援助表示感谢。
    今天，北京机场上中柬两国国旗迎风飘扬。当贵宾们乘坐的专机于下午四时徐徐着陆时，在冒着烈日伫立在机场上的欢迎人群中，立刻爆发出一片热烈的掌声和欢呼声。接着，乐队高奏两国国歌，西哈努克首相由周恩来总理陪同检阅了仪仗队。全体贵宾接受了首都少先队员们献给他们的鲜花。

    最后，当西哈努克首相和周恩来总理缓步走过欢迎群众面前的时候，热情的北京人民不停地为中柬两国友谊欢呼，许多女青年走出欢迎行列，把一束束鲜花送给贵宾们。
