    Farmers as Theoretical Teachers

    According to a report in the Shaanxi Daily, the Huangsangpu Township Reading Society Farmers' Spare-time Political School in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, has trained three farmer teachers to undertake theoretical teaching work.

    The theoretical teachers of the Reading Society Farmers' Spare-time Political School were originally cadres sent down to the countryside. Later, the Party branch of the commune, considering that the sent-down cadres were temporarily assigned to agricultural cooperatives for labor training and could not serve as teachers in the spare-time political school for a long time, decided to entrust the sent-down cadre Dai Depai to train three farmer workers, Li Yimin, Wang Jinmin, and Liu Xingduan, as theoretical teachers for the spare-time political school.

    Li Yimin, Wang Jinmin, and Liu Xingduan only had elementary, junior high, and senior high school education levels. Before lecturing, Dai Depai first helped them write outlines. After several people studied together, they lectured to the students. After class, Dai Depai helped them check the errors and shortcomings in their lectures. Now, these three farmer theoretical teachers have each given one to three lectures, and the students all say that they lecture in a popular, easy-to-understand, lively, and vivid way.

    农民当理论教员
    据陕西日报报道　陕西省西安黄桑圃乡读书一社农民业余政治学校，培养了三名农民教员担任理论教学工作。
    读书一社农民业余政治学校的理论教员原由下放干部担任。后来，该社党支部考虑到下放干部是临时下放到农业社劳动锻炼，不可能长期担任业余政治学校教员，决定委托下放干部戴德沛培养李义民、王金旻和刘兴端三个农民作业余政治学校理论教员。
    李义民、王金旻和刘兴端只有完小、初中和高中文化程度。在讲课之前，先由戴德沛帮助他们写好提纲，几个人一起研究后，再由他们给学员讲；下课后，戴德沛帮助他们检查讲课中的错误和缺点。现在，这三名农民理论教员，已分别讲了一课到三课，学员们都说他们讲得通俗易懂，生动活泼。
