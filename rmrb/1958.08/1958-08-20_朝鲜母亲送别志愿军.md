Korean Mother Bids Farewell to the Volunteer Army
Korean Correspondent Bai Xiangfan
    Xihe was more than two hundred *li* away from the station where the Volunteer Army troops were about to board the train to return home. But for Grandma Xian Zaifu, this was just a distance she could cover in one breath. She knew that to get to that station, she would have to cross two high mountains and wade through a river. However, for the sake of seeing off her Volunteer Army loved ones, these obstacles were nothing.
    She left the busy work in the commune behind and rushed to the station. The square in front of the station was already crowded with people.
    Every Korean bidding farewell to the Volunteer Army was filled with reluctance, and Grandma Xian Zaifu was even more so. She excitedly grasped the hands of the Volunteer Army soldiers tightly, and tears welled up in her eyes involuntarily.
    Grandma Xian Zaifu was originally a strong old woman who never shed tears. Not in the years when she suffered the cruel oppression and exploitation of Japanese imperialism; not during the brutal war; not when her only son volunteered to join the army and go to the front line… she had never shed a tear. But today, on the day of bidding farewell to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Grandma Xian Zaifu couldn't stop the tears from flowing, constantly wiping her tear-blurred eyes with her clothes.
    She said softly but forcefully to one of the Volunteer Army soldiers: "Go back, and when you get home, you must tell your parents what I said: on this land that your children have defended with their blood, we must build a happy paradise. Okay, take good care of yourselves, health is worth more than gold."
    As she spoke, she wiped away the tears that had fallen again.
    "Mom, please don't cry, we feel sad when Mom cries."
    While speaking, soldier Wang Qingshan used his handkerchief to wipe away the tears from the old woman’s face, his eyes also already moistened.
    "Who's crying? No, I'm not crying." The old woman tried her best to restrain herself, but the tears kept flowing.
    "This is the dagger my grandmother gave me when I got married, take it! I am willing to give you anything. Here, this is fried noodles, this is honey water mixed with boiled water, take it to quench your thirst on the train."
    Grandma Xian Zaifu, like so many Korean mothers, had a flesh-and-blood connection with the Volunteer Army soldiers, a bond of sharing hardships and living and dying together in battle.
    During the war, Grandma Xian Zaifu's house was destroyed by enemy planes, and her property and furniture were all blown away. When the American invading army reached her village, her husband was arrested by the enemy and buried alive on the pretext that he was a labor party member. She herself was imprisoned in a grain warehouse on the "crime" of being the "wife of a labor party member." It was at this time that the Volunteer Army came and rescued her.
    Grandma Xian Zaifu wiped the blood stains from her body and threw herself into supporting the Volunteer Army, she had only one thought: "Revenge! Avenge my husband, avenge countless loved ones!"
    The artillery fire at the foot of Mount Wusheng illuminated the distant Xihe Plain brightly. It had been burning for many days, and fierce fighting was taking place there. Gunfire and artillery fire rang out constantly.
      "Mom, you should go to the back and hide for a while." The Volunteer Army comrades advised her like this. But Grandma Xian Zaifu just shook her head. She rolled up her sleeves and took care of the Volunteer Army wounded. Even if enemy planes were bombing and strafing overhead, the old woman took care of the wounded day after day for months without taking a step back.
    Grandma Xian washed more than a thousand sets of blood-stained military uniforms day and night, and took all the seriously wounded into her own care, carrying them to her home. She took care of them meticulously. Her sincere, kind, and thoughtful care made the Volunteer Army wounded feel infinitely warm. The Volunteer Army comrades initially called her "Grandma Xian," but later simply dropped the "Xian" and called her "Mom" as if she were their own mother.
    One day, Grandma Xian Zaifu told her young daughter to take good care of the wounded, and went up the mountain alone with a sickle to cut firewood. As soon as she got to the mountain, she swung the sickle like lightning, and quickly made several bundles of firewood, tying them to the carrying frame. At this moment, a group of enemy jets suddenly flew into the sky and spotted the old woman wearing white clothes. The enemy planes immediately swooped down on her and fired a series of machine-gun bullets. Immediately afterwards, the enemy planes swooped down again and dropped bombs. In an instant, everything went black before the old woman's eyes, the smoke of the cannons filled the air, and the bundles of firewood also flew into the sky. "Damn things!" She cursed the enemy like this. Suddenly, she thought of the wounded lying at home, if the enemy planes dropped bombs down the mountain, who would take care of them! She immediately broke through the smoke and rushed home as fast as she could. Just as she was about to reach home, she heard piercing shouts: "Mom, Mo-om!"
    "Ah!" She exclaimed, it turned out that the seriously wounded, who even needed help with bowel movements, had climbed out of the house and were constantly shouting at the mountain.
    The mother and the wounded, who had met so unexpectedly, hugged each other tightly and shed tears because of excessive joy and excitement.
    The old woman carried the wounded back to the house one by one, and went back to the mountain to cut firewood.
    However, not long after, Grandma Xian Zaifu's house, like all the houses in the village, was finally bombed into ashes by the enemy. That day, as soon as the enemy planes appeared, the old woman quickly carried more than a dozen wounded to the air-raid shelter to hide. The enemy planes were still bombing and strafing frantically, but she still took the time to run back to her home again and again, moving the wounded's blankets and other daily necessities to the air-raid shelter, but she did not take out any of her own things.
    The old woman herself no longer had a house, so she handed over the wounded to the Volunteer Army medical unit, and took her young daughter to find a temporary residence in a neighboring village.
    However, the Volunteer Army did not separate from the old woman. When they learned of the old woman's residence, they loaded a cart of food, clothing, pots, pans, and everything else needed for living, and delivered it to Grandma Xian Zaifu's door. Although the old woman refused in every possible way, the Volunteer Army comrades were very stubborn, personally installed the pot for her, and brought firewood. One day, a Volunteer Army wounded person who had been cared for by the old woman came to Grandma Xian Zaifu's temporary residence with crutches.
    "Mom, there is a house, move there to live."
    Because the wounded person insisted on taking her there, she had no choice but to follow the wounded person to her former residence. She looked and saw that a brand-new house had been built on the former ruins, and she could still smell the fragrance of pine resin.
    "What's going on? Who built the house?" It turned out that it was built by the wounded themselves. They personally cut the wood, planed it, and made window frames, door frames and built it. When she heard these accounts, her throat immediately felt choked as if something was stuck in it, she couldn't say a word, and tears of gratitude flowed down.
    Now, as long as you go to the Xipu village of Jiangyuan Province, you can see this house. It still stands majestically in the place where the wounded once lay groaning. When the Volunteer Army comrades left here, they carefully painted a layer of white powder on the house again. It is located at the foot of the pine-covered mountains, and looks quiet, comfortable and beautiful. When the train carrying the Volunteer Army was about to depart, Grandma Xian Zaifu once again spoke to the Volunteer Army soldiers she had personally cared for about this house:
    "Don't worry, we will cherish and protect the house you built for us."
    The train drove north, and the sound of the whistle still lingered in the sky above Korea's beautiful mountains and rivers. Grandma Xian Zaifu watched the departing train, her eyes still flashing with dewdrops-like, crystal-clear tears. (Translated by Tian Dewan) (Attached picture)

　　朝鲜母亲送别志愿军
　　朝鲜  白相范
    洗浦离志愿军部队就要乘车回国的车站足有二百多里路。但这对咸在福老大娘来说，只不过是一口气就可以赶到的路程。她知道，要走到那个车站，需要翻过两座大山，趟过一条大河。但是，为了送别志愿军亲人，这些障碍一点也算不得什么。
    他丢下了社里繁忙的活儿，赶到了车站，车站前的广场上早已挤满了人群。
    送别志愿军的每一个朝鲜人都怀着依依难舍的心情，咸在福老大娘更是这样。她激动地紧紧握住了志愿军战士的手，眼里不由自主地淌出了晶莹的泪水。
    咸在福老大娘本是一位刚强从不知流泪的老妈妈。在那遭受日本帝国主义的残酷压迫和剥削的年代里；在那残酷的战争时期里；在她唯一的儿子志愿参军赴前线的时候；……她都没有掉过泪。可是今天，在送别中国人民志愿军的今天，咸在福老大娘却止不住流出了眼泪，不住地用衣襟擦着泪水模糊的眼睛。
    她低声地但是有力地对志愿军的一个战士说：“回去吧，回到家以后，你们可要把我的话告诉你们的父母：在你们的儿女用鲜血保卫了的这个国土上，我们一定要建设起幸福的乐园。好吧，要千万保重身体，健康是金子都换不来的呀。”
    说着，她又揩拭了落下来的眼泪。
    “妈妈，请你不要哭，妈妈哭了，我们也难过。”
    王庆山战士一面说一面拿手绢给老大娘揩着泪水，他的眼睛也早已润湿了。
    “谁哭啊？没有，我没有哭。”老大娘尽力抑制着自己，但是泪水却又不住地淌了下来。
    “这是我出嫁的时候祖母给我的匕首，拿去吧！只要是你们，我什么都可以舍得出来。给你，这是炒面，这是用开水搅了蜂蜜的蜜水，拿去在车上解解渴吧。”
    咸在福老大娘，正像许许多多朝鲜母亲一样，同志愿军的战士们有着骨肉相连的情感，有着战斗中共患难同生死的情感。
    战时，咸在福老大娘的房屋被敌人的飞机炸毁了，财物家具也都炸得无影无踪。到美国侵略军打到她的村庄时，丈夫被敌人捕了去，借口说他是劳动党员而把他活埋了，她自己也以“劳动党员的妻子”的“罪名”被囚禁在粮食仓库里。就在这个时候，志愿军赶来救出了她。
    咸在福老大娘擦干了身上的血迹，就投入了支援志愿军的工作里，她只有一个想法：“报仇！为丈夫报仇，为无数的亲人报仇！”
    五圣山麓的炮火，照得遥远的洗浦平原通亮通亮的。它已经烧了好多天了，那里正在进行着激烈的战斗。枪声炮声不间断地响着。
      “妈妈，你先到后面去躲一躲吧。”志愿军同志这样劝道。可是咸在福老大娘只是摇了摇头。她卷上袖子，照料志愿军伤员。那怕头上有敌机轰炸扫射，但是老大娘数月如一日地看护着伤员从不退后一步。
    咸老大娘夜以继日地洗涤了一千多套沾满血污的军装，而且把重伤员全由自己包了下来，背到自己家里。她无微不至地照料着他们。她的诚挚亲切而周到的看护，使志愿军伤员们感到无限的温暖。志愿军同志们起初称呼她“咸妈妈”，后来索性去掉了“咸”字，像叫亲妈妈似地只称呼着“妈妈”了。
    有一天，咸在福老大娘叮咛年幼的女儿好好照看伤员，自己一人拿着镰刀上山砍柴去了。一到山上，她就闪电般地挥动着镰刀，很快地打了几捆柴禾，捆到了背架上。正在这个时候，敌人的一群喷气机突然地飞到了上空，并且发现了穿着白衣服的老大娘。敌机立刻向她俯冲而下，射出了一连串的机枪弹。紧接着，敌机又一次俯冲下来，竟投下了炸弹。刹那间，老大娘眼前漆黑一团，炮烟弥漫，柴禾捆也飞上了天。“该死的东西！”她这样骂着敌人。忽然，她想起了躺在家里的那些伤员，敌机如在山下投弹，谁照顾他们啊！她立刻穿过炮烟，飞也似地奔向家里去。快到家时，她迎面听到了刺耳的喊叫声：“妈妈，妈—妈！”
    “啊！”她惊叫了一声，原来是连大小便都要人照顾的重伤员们都爬出房子朝着那座山在不断喊着她。
    这样意外相逢的母亲和伤员们，由于过分的喜悦和兴奋，都紧紧搂抱着流出了眼泪。
    老大娘把伤员一个个地背到家里，又到山上砍柴去了。
    然而不久以后，咸在福大娘的房子，也和村里的所有房屋一样，终于被敌人炸成了灰烬。那天，敌机刚一出现，老大娘就神速地把十多个伤员背到防空洞隐蔽起来。敌机仍在疯狂地轰炸和扫射，但她还是抽空一次又一次地奔到家里，将伤员的毯子和其他日用品都搬到了防空洞，可是她自己的东西却一件也没有拿出来。
    老大娘自己已没有了房子，就将伤员移交给志愿军医务机关，自己则带着小女儿搬到邻村找了个临时住处。
    不过，志愿军并没有和老大娘分开，当他们知道老大娘的住处后，就装了一马车吃的、穿的和锅碗瓢盆等生活上所需的一切东西，给咸在福老大娘送上门来。老大娘虽然百般拒绝，可是志愿军同志们却执拗得很，亲自动手给她安上了锅，打来了柴禾。一天，有一位老大娘看护过的志愿军伤员拄着拐杖来到了咸在福老大娘的临时住处。
    “妈妈，有了一所房子，搬到那儿住吧。”
    因为这位伤员硬要拉着她去，她也不得已地跟着伤员来到了从前的住处。一看，在从前的废墟上建成了一座崭新的房子，还可以闻到松香的味道呢。
    “这是怎么搞的呀？是谁盖的房子？”原来这是伤员们亲手盖起来的，是他们，亲手砍来木材，又亲手刨平，打成窗框门框盖起来的。当她听到这些述说的时候，她的喉咙马上像被什么东西噎住了似的，说不出话来，流下了感激的泪水。
    现在，只要是到了江原道洗浦村庄，就能看到这所房子。它依旧雄伟地屹立在伤员们曾经躺着呻吟过的那个地方。志愿军同志们离开这里的时候，又给这所房子精心地涂上了一层白粉。它座落在松树繁茂的山麓下，显得幽静、舒适而漂亮。当载着志愿军的列车就要出发的时候，咸在福老大娘再次同她亲自照顾过的志愿军战士们讲起了这所房子：
    “放心吧，你们给盖的房子，我们一定会珍重保护的。”
    列车向北开走了，汽笛声还萦绕在朝鲜的锦绣山河的上空。咸在福老大娘望着走远了的火车，眼里仍在闪烁着露水般晶莹的泪珠。  （田得万译）（附图片）
