    Shanghai Second Printing and Dyeing Factory Party Committee Strengthens Political and Ideological Leadership
    Technical Innovation Surges Wave Upon Wave
    (Our report) The Chinese Communist Party's Shanghai Second Printing and Dyeing Factory Committee, in the technical innovation movement, has grasped political and ideological leadership work firmly, causing the movement to develop vigorously and continuously achieve outstanding successes. By the end of June, the factory's employees had completed more than six hundred innovation projects, and the production efficiency of twelve processes had increased by half or more than doubled. They also successfully trial-produced more than thirty important new products, exceeding the total number of new products in the past eight years.
    Continuously Proposing New Goals
    The characteristic of the Party Committee's work in grasping political and ideological work is: according to the spirit of continuous revolution, to summarize the progress of the movement and existing problems at any time, and to propose new goals for technical innovation in a timely manner, so that the high tide of technical innovation surges wave upon wave. In early February, based on the factory's long-standing problem of low product quality, the Party Committee put forward sixteen key problems such as unbleached cloth, unfixed colors in dyed cloth, and unfresh colors in printed cloth, and mobilized the masses to solve them. The workers made many suggestions and overcame these weak links one by one, so that the factory's production level quickly leaped to the advanced ranks. At this time, some leading personnel and workers were breeding complacency and conservatism, believing that there was nothing to innovate in the factory, and the direction of how to proceed with the second step of technical innovation was unclear. The Party Committee analyzed this situation and believed that the masses' enthusiasm for technical innovation should be guided to a broader and more open field. Therefore, according to the factory's new direction and new tasks of mainly producing high-end products for export in the future, it put forward forty articles of the factory's technical revolution program, requiring production to gradually become continuous, multi-headed, and automated, and to trial-produce world-class new products. Subsequently, the whole factory set off a second upsurge of technical innovation, transforming a large number of machines and equipment, and trial-producing many new products. After the mass technical revolution was universally launched, the Party Committee began to organize a third technical revolution upsurge, formulating a long-term plan, requiring the entire factory to be transformed within two years into a comprehensive factory that not only mastered the world's most advanced printing and dyeing technology, but also could manufacture its own printing and dyeing machines and special dyes. Now, the workers and masses have actively acted to realize this plan.
    Timely Discovery of New Things
    In the past few months, the factory Party Committee has drawn four of the five Party Committee members to go to the workshops to specifically lead the technical revolution, support the masses' creations, and help the masses solve difficulties. At the beginning, some cadres believed that the technical revolution was to solve some complex technical problems, which ordinary workers could not solve. They only gave the technical revolution program formulated by the factory department to technical personnel for discussion. However, the technical personnel were intimidated by so many projects and did not dare to do anything; the program slept in their drawers. After the Party Committee members went down, they immediately organized workers and technical personnel to discuss the technical revolution program and put forward innovation suggestions. Many important reforms were discovered in their infancy and grew rapidly with the support of the Party Committee. For example, a Party Committee member discovered in the workshop that Wu Qinggao, a worker who operated the machine, was studying the technology of changing single-layer cloth to double-layer cloth while priming it. He believed that this was one of the ways for the printing, finishing, and dyeing workshops to carry out technical innovation, so he immediately organized technical forces to help him successfully trial-produce it in advance and promoted it in the two workshops. A technician discovered that a certain dye was particularly sensitive to sunlight and wanted to use it for photographic printing. After a Party Committee member learned about this, he immediately mobilized other workers and technicians to help him experiment. In less than a month, they successfully experimented with this new photographic printing technology that had never existed in the world.
    Protecting the Enthusiasm of the Masses in Every Way
    The factory Party Committee paid special attention to protecting the enthusiasm of the masses for technical innovation and correcting the short-sighted bias of some cadres who only looked at the immediate economic effects. For example, at the very beginning of the movement, the workers in the electrical group of the mechanical workshop planned to manufacture a dishwasher for the kitchen, but some cadres did not support it, believing that it was not relevant to the current production. However, the Party Committee believed that making a dishwasher could liberate the physical labor of the cooks, which was a good wish; at the same time, by supporting this plan, after the enthusiasm of the masses was brought into play, more creations would appear. Sure enough, after the workers of the electrical group made the dishwasher, they were in high spirits and successively made temperature automatic regulators, semiconductor thermometers, and other instruments that were very useful for production.
    Through the technical innovation movement, this factory is climbing the peak of the world's printing and dyeing technology step by step. Now, the quality of products such as Falamin khaki and variegated poplin has caught up with international standards; they have also successfully trial-produced fragrant printed cloth, which is very popular in the international market, as well as special products such as fireproof cloth and rustproof cloth for the national defense industry, and mastered the world's most advanced technology such as electronic engraving of printing rollers.

    上海第二印染厂党委加强政治思想领导
    技术革新浪潮一浪高过一浪
    本报讯　中共上海第二印染厂委员会在技术革新运动中抓紧政治思想领导工作，使运动蓬勃开展，不断取得优异的成就。到6月底，全厂职工就完成了六百多个革新项目，十二道工序的生产效率分别提高了半倍或一倍以上。他们还试制成功了三十多种重要的新产品，超过了过去八年新产品的总数。
    不断提出新目标
    这个厂的党委抓政治思想工作的特点是：根据不断革命的精神，随时总结运动进展的情况和存在的问题，适时地提出革新技术的新目标，使技术革新的高潮一浪高过一浪。2月初，党委根据厂里长期存在的产品质量不高的情况，提出了漂布不白、色布染色不牢、花布染色不鲜艳等十六个关键问题，发动群众解决。职工们提了许多建议，一个一个地克服了这些薄弱环节，使工厂的生产水平很快跃进到先进行列。这时，部分领导人员和职工滋长着自满保守情绪，认为本厂没有什么好革新了，对革新技术的第二步怎样走法，方向不明确。党委分析了这种情况，认为应当把群众革新技术的热情引导到更为远大开扩的领域中去。于是根据工厂今后主要生产出口的高级产品的新方向、新任务，提出了全厂技术革命纲要四十条，要求使生产逐步作到连续化、多头化、自动化，试制世界上第一流的新产品。接着，全厂掀起了第二个革新技术的高潮，改装了大批的机器设备，试制出许多新产品。在群众性的技术革命普遍展开以后，党委又着手组织第三个技术革命高潮，拟定出远景规划，要求两年内把全厂改变成为不仅掌握世界上最先进的印染技术，而且能自己制造印染机器和特种染料的综合性工厂。现在，职工群众已经为实现这一规划积极行动起来。
    及时发现新生事物
    几个月来，工厂党委从五个党委委员中抽出四个人下车间具体领导技术革命，支持群众创造，帮助群众解决困难。开始时，有些干部认为技术革命是解决一些复杂的技术问题，一般工人解决不了。他们把厂部拟定出来的技术革命纲要只交给技术人员去讨论。技术人员却被这么多的项目吓住了，不敢动手搞；纲要在他们抽屉里睡大觉。党委委员下去以后，立刻组织工人群众和技术人员一起讨论技术革命纲要，提出革新的建议。很多重要的改革在萌芽时期就被发现，在党委的支持下迅速成长。如一个党委委员在车间里发现挡车工人吴庆高在研究变单层布为两层布同时打底的技术，认为这是印整和漂染两个车间开展技术革新的道路之一，就马上组织技术力量，帮助他提前试制成功，并且在两个车间推广。有个技术人员发现一种染料对阳光特别敏感，想利用它来进行照像印花。一位党委委员知道这件事情以后，立刻动员其他工人和技术人员帮助他试验。不到一个月，他们就试验成功了这种世界上从未有过的照像印花的新技术。
    多方爱护群众积极性
    工厂党委特别注意爱护群众的革新技术的积极性，纠正有些干部只看眼前的经济效果，眼光短浅的偏向。譬如在运动刚刚开始的时候，机动车间电工小组的工人打算给伙房制造一台洗碗机，有些干部不支持，认为这同当前生产关系不大。但是党委认为：搞洗碗机可以解脱炊事员的体力劳动，是一个好愿望；同时，支持这一计划，群众的积极性发挥起来以后，更多的创造就会出现。果然，电工小组的工人在制成洗碗机以后，情绪很高，又接连制成了温度自动调节器、半导体测温仪等对生产上十分有用的仪器。
    这个工厂通过技术革新运动，一步一步地攀登着世界印染技术的高峰。现在，凡拉明卡其、杂色府绸等产品的质量，已经赶上了国际水平；他们还试制成功了在国际市场上深受欢迎的香味花布，以及国防工业用的防火布、防锈布等特殊产品，掌握了电传雕刻印花滚筒等世界上最先进的技术。　（季群）
