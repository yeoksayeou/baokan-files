　　Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: According to a report by a Deutsche Presse-Agentur (West Germany) reporter from Beirut on the 11th, a spokesman for the invading US forces in Lebanon admitted that the United States is "negotiating" with the Lebanese army regarding the "training" of Lebanese troops by American officers.
    The invading US forces' approach is obviously a conspiracy to infiltrate and control the Lebanese army through so-called "training," while it remains in Lebanon for a long time.

　  美企图控制黎军队
    新华社12日讯　据西德的德意志新闻社记者11日自贝鲁特报道，侵黎美军发言人承认，美国正在同黎巴嫩陆军方面“谈判”由美国军官“训练”黎巴嫩军队的问题。
    侵黎美军的这种做法显然是阴谋在它长期赖在黎巴嫩的同时，还通过所谓“训练”来渗入和控制黎巴嫩的军队。
