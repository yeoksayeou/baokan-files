Young Pioneers' "Squad Home"
　　
Eighty-four "Squad Homes" have been established at Changsha Road Primary School in Tianjin. The children are all vying to ask the brigade instructor to set up the "Squad Home" in their own homes. They didn't spend a penny, but they decorated the "Squad Homes" neatly and beautifully. Each "Squad Home" has established a group pact, stipulating that half a day be spent doing holiday homework and half a day be spent carrying out recreational and sports activities. The children of the second squad of the eighth detachment's "Squad Home" are making toys for the street kindergarten. Some "Squad Homes" have "All-Purpose Hands Factory, First Workshop Weaving Group" written on the door frame, and the little workers are dismantling broken socks, and they are using the dismantled thread to weave many colorful little schoolbags, bicycle handlebar covers and other products.

　　少先队员的“小队之家”
    天津市长沙路小学建立了八十四个“小队之家”。小朋友们都争着向大队辅导员要求：把“小队之家”设在自己家里。他们没有花一个钱，却把“小队之家”布置得整洁美观。每一个“小队之家”，都订立了小组公约，规定半天做假期作业，半天开展文体活动。第八中队二小队的“小队之家”的小朋友为街道幼儿园做玩具。有的“小队之家”的门框上写着“万能双手工厂第一车间编织组”，小工人们在拆破袜子，他们用拆下来的线编织了许多五色缤纷的小书包、自行车的把手套等产品。
