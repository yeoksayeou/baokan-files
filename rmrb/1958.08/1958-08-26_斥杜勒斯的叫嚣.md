　　Denouncing Dulles's Clamor
　　Yi Mo
　　The Fujian front continues to send us joyous news of victory. Six hundred million Chinese people warmly applaud the great victories achieved by the heroic troops on the Fujian front: well done, these traitors—the running dogs of imperialism—deserve to be punished.
　　However, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in order to cheer on his running dogs, dared to grossly interfere in our internal affairs. In his letter to Representative Morgan, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he nonsensically said: "These islands have always been in the hands of the Republic of China, and in the past four years, the connection between these islands and Formosa has become closer, and their interdependence has increased." He even threatened: "I believe that anyone who imagines that the Chinese Communists' attempt to use force to change this situation and now attack and attempt to occupy these islands may be a limited military operation is very dangerous. I am concerned that this would constitute a threat to peace in the region. Therefore, I hope and believe that this will not happen."
　　This is utterly shameless and ridiculous! Dulles cannot fail to understand that his so-called "Republic of China" has in fact been dead for many years. The small group of people now parasitic in Taiwan are nothing more than a group of wandering ghosts driven out of the mainland by 600 million people. Under the protection of the United States, they can only eke out a meager existence. And our sacred territories: the Greater and Lesser Kinmen, the Matsu Islands, and Taiwan, etc., cannot be defiled by these stinking things—the American aggressors and their running dogs—for long. Because these inviolable sacred territories of our country, and other territories of our People's Republic of China, are truly closely and inseparably connected. However, for several years, the American invading army has been entrenched in the Taiwan Strait, constantly carrying out provocative activities and hindering the Chinese people's liberation movement. It is precisely the U.S. imperialists who "constitute a threat to peace in the region."
　　Liberating Taiwan and liberating these islands is our country's internal affair and the sacred right of our people. We can liberate it whenever we want, and we can liberate it in whatever way we want. This has nothing to do with any Dulles or other foreigners. The Chinese people are by no means cowards, nor are they weaklings who willingly endure bullying. No threat can shake the confidence of 600 million people in liberating their own territory. Dulles's threatening clamor, in addition to being a waste of effort, can only once again expose the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism and strengthen the firm will of our people to liberate Taiwan!
　　We warn the arrogant and shameless Dulles, open your eyes and see what kind of people are standing in front of you, what position you are in, and what position we are in. Get your ass out of here as soon as possible, stay away from our territory. If you dare to interfere in our internal affairs, then the Taiwan Strait will become your bottomless coffin!

### 斥杜勒斯的叫嚣

　　斥杜勒斯的叫嚣
　　伊默
    福建前线不断给我们送来胜利的欢乐。六亿中国人民为福建前线英雄部队所取得的伟大胜利热烈欢呼：打得好，应该惩罚这些卖国贼——帝国主义的走狗。
    可是，美国国务卿杜勒斯为了给他的走狗打气，竟敢粗暴地干涉我国内政，在他给美众院外委会主席摩根的信里，信口雌黄地说：“这些岛屿一直在中华民国手中，在过去四年当中这些岛屿与福摩萨之间的联系变得更加紧密，他们之间的相互依靠程度也有了增加。”而且还威胁说：“我认为，任何人要是设想，中国共产党人企图用武力改变这种情况并在现在进攻和企图占领这些岛屿可能是一种有限的军事行动，那是十分危险的。我担心这会构成这个地区的和平的威胁。因此，我希望并且相信这种事情不会发生。”
    真是无耻已极和可笑已极！杜勒斯不会不明白，他所谓的“中华民国”，实际上早已死亡了多年；现在寄生在台湾的那一小撮人，只不过是被六亿人民逐出大陆的一批游魂孤鬼，在美国卵翼之下他们也不过只能苟延残喘而已。而我们神圣的领土：大小金门、马祖各岛，以及台湾等地，是不能长期地被这些臭东西——美国侵略者同它的走狗们沾污的。因为我国这些不可侵犯的神圣领土，和我们中华人民共和国其他领土，才是真正的紧密不可分割的。但是，几年以来，美国侵略军一直盘踞在台湾海峡，不断地进行挑衅活动，阻挠中国人民的解放运动。正是美帝国主义者“构成这个地区的和平的威胁”。
    解放台湾和解放这些岛屿，是我国的内政，我国人民的神圣权利。我们想什么时候解放它，就什么时候解放，想用什么方式解放它，就用什么方式解放。这同任何杜勒斯之流的外国人都屁不相干。中国人决不是胆小鬼，也决不是那种甘受欺凌的软胎子。任何威胁都动摇不了六亿人民解放自己领土的信心。杜勒斯威胁性的叫嚣，除了白费力气以外，只能又一次暴露美帝国主义的侵略野心，加强我国人民解放台湾的坚定意志！
    我们警告狂妄无耻的杜勒斯，睁眼看看面前站的是什么样的人，你自己处在什么地位，我们又处在什么地位。趁早滚你的蛋，离我们的领土远一点，如果你胆敢干涉我们的内政，那么，台湾海峡就会成为你们的无底棺材！
