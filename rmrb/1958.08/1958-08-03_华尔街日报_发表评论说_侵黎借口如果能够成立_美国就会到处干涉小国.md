Xinhua News Agency, 2nd August - The American "Wall Street Journal" published an editorial on July 28, expressing disagreement with the pretext Eisenhower created for sending troops to invade Lebanon.

　　The editorial, entitled "No End," stated: "Eisenhower has explained that the reason the United States is sending troops to Lebanon is because it feels that otherwise, no small country anywhere in the non-Communist world will feel that it is not facing the danger of overthrowing the government from any source, whether foreign or domestic, Communist or non-Communist."

　　The newspaper said, "If this reasoning is the reason we took action in Lebanon, then its clear implication is that the United States may intervene in any country in the future, as long as the government of that country feels threatened from any quarter."

　　The newspaper pointed out that according to Eisenhower's logic, the kind of military action taken by the United States in the Lebanese incident could be extended globally. The newspaper said, "There are about a hundred countries in the world, many of which are small, and the governments of many countries are fragile and can be overthrown by revolution at any time." "If we let the precedent of Lebanon establish the principle of endless intervention, we will be running ourselves ragged."

### “华尔街日报”发表评论说  侵黎借口如果能够成立  美国就会到处干涉小国

    “华尔街日报”发表评论说
    侵黎借口如果能够成立  美国就会到处干涉小国
    新华社2日讯　美国“华尔街日报”7月28日发表社论，表示不同意艾森豪威尔为出兵侵略黎巴嫩所制造的借口。
    这篇以“没有止境”为题的社论写道：“艾森豪威尔曾经解释说，美国所以要派军队去黎巴嫩，是因为它感到，不然的话，非共产党世界任何地方就没有一个小国家能够感到它没有面临任何来源的推翻政府的危险，不论这来源是国外的还是国内的，共产党的还是非共产党的。”
    这家报纸说，“如果这种道理是我们在黎巴嫩采取行动的理由的话，那么它的明白的含意就是：美国以后可能干涉任何国家，只要这个国家的政府感到它受到不论来自哪一方面的威胁。”
    报纸指出，按照艾森豪威尔这种逻辑，美国在黎巴嫩事件中所采取的那种军事行动就可以扩大到全球了，这家报纸说，“全世界大约有百来个国家，其中许多是小国，许多国家的政府很脆弱，随时可能被革命所推翻。”“如果我们让黎巴嫩的先例确立了无止境的干涉原则，我们是要疲于奔命的。”
