Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 11th: Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk and his party arrived in Delhi, the capital of India, this afternoon. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and cabinet ministers welcomed them at the airport.

Chinese Ambassador to India, Pan Zili, and diplomatic envoys from other countries also welcomed them at the airport.

Prime Minister Sihanouk made a statement to reporters at the airport, saying that Cambodia is suffering serious difficulties from the outside. Because Cambodia pursues a strict policy of neutrality, it has been slandered and antagonized by certain countries. This policy of neutrality, and the policy of being friendly with the people of all countries in the world, has been misunderstood, and even regarded as a provocation. Sihanouk said that today's Cambodia, like India, only thinks of peace, and its only ambition is to make its own contribution to the development of friendly relations between the people of all countries. It is reported that Prime Minister Sihanouk will discuss issues such as Cambodia's policies with Prime Minister Nehru.

　　西哈努克到达德里
    新华社新德里11日电　柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克一行今天下午到达印度首都德里。印度总理尼赫鲁和内阁部长们到机场欢迎他们。
    中国驻印度大使潘自力和其他国家的外交使节也到机场欢迎。
    西哈努克首相在机场对记者发表声明说，柬埔寨正遭受着从外面来的严重困难。由于柬埔寨奉行严格中立政策，它遭到某些国家的诬蔑和敌视。这种中立政策以及同世界上一切国家的人民友好的政策遭到误解，甚至被认为是一种挑衅行为。西哈努克说，今天的柬埔寨像印度一样，心中想的只有和平，它的唯一的雄心是对发展各国人民之间的友好关系作出自己的贡献。有消息说，西哈努克首相将同尼赫鲁总理讨论关于柬埔寨的政策等问题。
