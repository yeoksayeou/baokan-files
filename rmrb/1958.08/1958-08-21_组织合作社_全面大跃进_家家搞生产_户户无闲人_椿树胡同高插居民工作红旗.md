　　Organize Cooperatives, Leap Forward in All Aspects, Every Household Engaged in Production, No Idle Person in Any Household
　　The Red Flag of Residents' Work Flies High in Chunshu Hutong
　　
This newspaper reports: The Red Flag Residents' Cooperative, organized by residents of Chunshu Hutong in Xuanwu District, Beijing, uses production as its center to promote an all-round Great Leap Forward in street work.
　　Within the jurisdiction of this residential area, there are 2,129 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, the majority of whom are family members of cadres. After more than half a year of rectification, their political awareness has greatly improved, and they are eager to participate in social activities. Under the leadership of the local Party and government, 1,700 people have now participated in more than ten types of labor production. They have now established a binding factory, a children's toy factory, a feather duster factory, and forty-one production groups for making paper pockets, sewing, etc., seventeen nursery classes, two kindergartens, a children's playground, three childcare groups, a breastfeeding room, five canteens, and a shower room. They also handle business for four state-owned stores and a bank savings office.
　　In addition, they have transformed seven small vendors and transformed a private joint clinic into a resident's hospital. All of these were started by the masses through hard work, struggling without resources, and self-reliance, without spending a single cent of the state's money. When it was first proposed that the streets engage in production, the residents were full of enthusiasm. In the spirit of struggling without resources, working hard, starting from scratch, and self-reliance, some people vacated their surplus houses, and some residents even converted their bedrooms into "workshops." More than 100 people heard about building a factory and repaired a dilapidated temple in the pouring rain to use as a factory building. Without money to run the factory, the residents engaged in large-scale voluntary labor, building walls and repairing houses. Without materials, everyone took out bricks, tiles, and wood from their homes to repair the factory buildings. Lacking funds, each member voluntarily contributed one yuan as a membership fund. In this way, three factories that could accommodate more than 200 people were established in less than a week. After residents participated in production, they created and accumulated wealth for the country and supported industrial construction.
　　Residents' lives have gradually improved as they have incomes from participating in production. According to incomplete statistics, in July, most residents only started production in the second half of the month, had not yet completely gotten rid of household chores, and were not yet proficient in technology. They received more than 4,000 yuan in processing fees. After organizing residents to form a residents' cooperative, it not only supported industry and improved residents' lives, but also a new atmosphere of everyone engaged in production and no idle person in any household began to appear on the streets.
　　After production was started, this Red Flag Cooperative, in order to reduce the housework of housewives, adopted the method of organizing collective life and vigorously developed service industries, gradually socializing housework. The nursery classes that were established enrolled more than 1,200 children aged three to seven. One nursery class in Mianhuatoutiao Hutong has a total of 39 children, 33 of whom have mothers who participated in production because they entrusted their children to the class.
　　In order to enable local businesses to better serve the residents, this cooperative handles and sells goods on behalf of three non-staple food stores and one department store in this area. These four stores have absorbed 33 members to participate in the work, and there are still six old store employees. These stores are all located in the hutongs, and the commodities are mostly daily necessities closely related to the lives of residents, such as oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, vegetables, and meat.
　　After participating in social labor, people's collectivist ideas are also growing, and the relationship between people is also changing. Originally, there were many residents who indirectly cursed others and had fights and quarrels, but now unity and mutual assistance have begun to become the social atmosphere. Originally, there were more than 100 courtyards in the entire jurisdiction that were constantly fighting, some even arguing for ten or eight years, but now they have basically been transformed into united courtyards. In short, a new situation of "everyone loves labor, every household reads aloud, every family is a 'Five-Good' family, and every courtyard emphasizes hygiene" has begun to appear on the streets.

　　组织合作社  全面大跃进  家家搞生产  户户无闲人
    椿树胡同高插居民工作红旗
    本报讯  北京宣武区椿树胡同居民组织的红旗居民合作社，以生产为中心，推动街道工作全面大跃进。
    在这个居民区的管界内，共有二千一百二十九个劳动力和半劳动力，其中绝大部分是干部家属。她们经过半年多的整风运动，政治觉悟有了很大的提高，迫切地要求参加社会活动。在当地的党和政府的领导下，现在已经有一千七百人参加了十几种劳动生产。她们现在已经办起装订厂、儿童玩具厂、毛掸厂和糊纸口袋、缝纫等四十一个生产组，十七个幼儿班，二个幼儿园，一个儿童乐园，三个托儿组，一个哺乳室，五个食堂和一个淋浴室，还为四个国营商店及一个银行储蓄所代办了业务。
    另外，还改造了七户小商贩，将一个私营的联合诊所改造成了居民医院。所有这些都是群众苦干、穷干、白手起家办起来的，没花国家一分钱。在开始提出街道搞生产时，居民个个干劲冲天，本着穷干、苦干、白手起家、自力更生的精神，有些人腾出自己多余的房子，有的居民还把自己的寝室改为“车间”，有一百多人听说搞工厂，冒着大雨整修好了一所破庙作了厂房。办工厂没有钱，居民就大搞义务劳动，砌墙修房子；没材料大家就把自己家中的砖瓦木料拿出修厂房；缺少资金，每个社员就自愿拿出一块钱，作为入社基金；这样不到一个星期的时间就办起了三个能容纳二百多人的工厂。居民参加生产以后，给国家创造和积累了财富，支援了工业建设。
    居民参加生产有了收入，生活也逐步得到改善。据不完全统计，7月份大多数居民一般在下半月才开始投入生产、基本上还没有摆脱家务劳动、技术还不熟练的情况下，就得到加工费四千余元。组织居民成立居民合作社后，不仅支援了工业，改善了居民的生活，街道上也开始出现了人人搞生产、户户无闲人的新气象。
    这个红旗社在生产搞起来以后，为了减轻家庭妇女的家务劳动，采取了组织集体生活的办法，大办服务事业，使家务劳动逐步社会化。办的幼儿班收了一千二百多个三至七岁的孩子。棉花头条胡同一个幼儿班，共有孩子三十九人，其中有三十三个妈妈，因为托了孩子，分别参加了生产。
    为了使当地的商业能更好地为居民服务，这个社为这片地区的三个副食品商店，一个百货店，经办和代销商品。这四个商店共吸收了三十三名社员参加工作，仍有六名老店员。这些商店都座落在胡同里，商品多是油、盐、酱、醋、蔬菜、肉类等同居民生活非常密切的日用品。
    参加社会劳动后，人们的集体主义思想也在增长，人和人的关系也在发生着变化。原来居民之间指桑骂槐，打架吵嘴的很多，现在团结互助已经开始成为社会风气。原来全管界有一百多个打“罗圈架”的大院，有的甚至十年、八年争吵不休，现在基本上改变成团结院了。总之，现在街道上已经开始出现了一个“人人爱劳动，户户读书声，家家皆五好，院院讲卫生”的新局面。（附图片）
