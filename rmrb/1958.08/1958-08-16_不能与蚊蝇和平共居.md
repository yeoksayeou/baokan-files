　　Cannot Coexist Peacefully with Mosquitoes and Flies
    During this trip to Sichuan, I visited several places: Pixian, Jianyang, and Nanchong. The number of mosquitoes and flies in these areas has decreased beyond comparison with previous years, and the harm caused by mosquitoes and flies to the people has also been reduced beyond comparison with previous years. This is a tremendous achievement of the Elimination of Seven Pests campaign. However, I feel that many cadres in these areas have not actively participated in the campaign to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and there is a tendency to "coexist peacefully" with them. Sometimes, in the canteen or in the guest room, I see flies flying around triumphantly, and I really want to kill them, but I don't have a fly swatter. Yet, some of these cadres in the institutions seem indifferent to the flies.
    There are quite a few mosquitoes in the Pixian and Jianyang county party committee offices, and even more mosquitoes in the Nanchong prefectural committee office. Despite the large number of mosquitoes, some cadres in these offices do not thoroughly eliminate them.
    Eliminating mosquitoes and flies is everyone's responsibility. The masses should actively participate, and cadres should participate even more actively. Shouldn't the situation of some cadres in the above-mentioned offices coexisting peacefully with mosquitoes and flies be changed quickly?

　　不能与蚊蝇和平共居
    我这次在四川跑了几个地方：郫县、简阳、南充。这些地方的蚊蝇比起往年已减少得无法比拟，人们所受蚊蝇的危害比起往年也减轻得无法比拟，这是除七害运动的巨大成绩。但是，我觉得这些地方的不少机关干部对消灭蚊蝇的运动并没有身体力行，积极参加，颇有与蚊蝇“和平共居”之势。有时我在食堂中或者客房中看到苍蝇飞得得意忘形，真想把它消灭而后快，但没有蝇拍，而这些机关的有些干部对苍蝇却似乎满不在乎。
    郫县、简阳县委机关的蚊子都不少，南充地委机关的蚊子更多，蚊子虽然这样多，但有些机关干部却不去彻底消灭它。
    消灭蚊蝇，人人有责，群众要积极参加，干部更要积极参加，像上面所说的这些机关某些干部同蚊蝇和平共居的情况不是应该赶快改变吗？
