    People's Army, People's War
    – In Commemoration of the 31st Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Zhu De
    The People's Liberation Army is an army of the people. Landlords and capitalists do not allow the people to have an army, so from the moment the People's Liberation Army was born, the reactionary army fought and besieged it every day. But because this army had the leadership of the Communist Party, had proletarian politics in command, and had the support of the people, it was not only not wiped out, but grew larger and stronger as it fought, finally overcoming all kinds of hardships and achieving national victory.

    The absolute obedience of the proletarian army to the leadership of the Communist Party, the most loyal representative of the interests of the proletariat, is the basic principle of the construction of the proletarian army. In the decades of leading revolutionary armed struggles, the Chinese Communist Party has adhered to and developed this principle, establishing a complete system for the Party to lead the army. This includes the system of combining collective leadership by the Party committee with division of labor and responsibility by the leaders, the political commissar system, the political work system, and so on. The purpose of establishing these systems is to ensure the revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army, to ensure that the People's Liberation Army always has a clear political direction and goals, and to continuously improve the class consciousness of all officers and soldiers, so that the People's Liberation Army becomes an invincible army that cannot be defeated or suppressed.
  
    The mass line is the fundamental line of all our Party's work, and military work is of course no exception. Following the mass line in military work means acknowledging that relying on the full support of the soldier masses and the people is the fundamental guarantee for winning the war. From this point of view, under the leadership of the Party, the People's Liberation Army has established a complete set of systems and principles over the decades. These include the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, the army undertaking three tasks: fighting, production, and doing mass work, political equality between officers and soldiers, and implementing political democracy, economic democracy, and military democracy within the troops. The implementation of these systems and principles has ensured close ties between the army and the people, between superiors and subordinates within the army, and between officers and soldiers, and has promoted the initiative of the masses, becoming an inexhaustible source of strength for the People's Liberation Army to overcome difficulties and achieve victory.

    In the past decade or so, military technology has developed rapidly. Can it be said that due to the rapid development of military technology, from now on we should no longer rely primarily on putting politics in command, but simply rely on technology? No, no matter how military technology develops, the experience of putting politics in command will never be outdated. Of course, in future wars, great importance must be given to the significance of new technical equipment. However, we are not proponents of the theory of weapons as the sole factor. We believe that what ultimately determines the outcome of war is not technology, but politics, political systems, and the will of the people. Any technology serves a certain politics, any technology is created by people, developed by people, and mastered by people. Those who hold purely military viewpoints unilaterally emphasize military affairs and belittle politics; unilaterally emphasize professional skills and technology and belittle ideology; unilaterally emphasize the role of individuals and ignore the collective strength of the Party and the masses; only talk about tactics and techniques, not about strategy; only want the army and ignore the role of the people; only pay attention to national defense construction and ignore the significance of economic construction for national defense construction. This is essentially a manifestation of bourgeois military thought and is contrary to Marxism-Leninism. They advocate not putting politics in command, but in reality, without proletarian politics in command, there will inevitably be bourgeois politics in command.

    The greater part of the history of the Chinese Communist Party is a history of leading revolutionary armed struggles. Our Party's experience in leading revolutionary armed struggles is extremely rich. Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought represents the correct military line of the Chinese Communist Party and concentrates the rich experience of the Chinese revolutionary war. In the process of leading the victory of China's democratic revolution and socialist revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism to guide the practice of the Chinese revolution, and brilliantly developed Marxism-Leninism from the problems of revolution to the problems of socialist construction based on China's conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong applied dialectical materialism to guide revolutionary war, creatively developing the military science of Marxism-Leninism, which is the construction line of the people's army and the strategic and tactical thinking of people's war. It has successfully withstood the test of more than 20 years of revolutionary war and the three-year War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; in the future, it will also guide the Chinese people to achieve victory in the new struggle against imperialist aggression.

    The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought is invincible is that it is thoroughly dialectical materialist and completely Marxist-Leninist. When the 1927 revolution failed and turned to the Communist Party independently leading the Chinese democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong's two earliest military works, namely "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" and "The Struggle in the Jinggang Mountains," played a significant guiding role in this strategic shift in our country's revolutionary struggle at that time.

    From the Jinggang Mountains struggle to the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Army of the Red Army in December 1929, the Party's correct military line, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, was formed. The resolution of the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Army of the Red Army laid the foundation for the principles of building the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and these principles are still applicable today. Because of this correct line, the revolutionary war continued to achieve victories, and the revolutionary base areas continued to expand. However, because the "Left" opportunists opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line, the revolutionary war once suffered setbacks. Comrade Mao Zedong's book "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" systematically summarized the rich revolutionary war experience of this historical period. When the land revolutionary war turned to the anti-Japanese war, our Party again took the ideas expounded in Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" and "Strategic Problems of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War" as a guide, realized the strategic shift at that time, and, by implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology, continuously achieved the victory of the anti-Japanese war and formed a powerful people's army. After the end of the anti-Japanese war, when the Chiang Kai-shek group launched another all-out civil war, Comrade Mao Zedong again guided us to realize a new strategic shift and guided the Chinese People's Liberation War to achieve national victory with the "Ten Major Military Principles." At all these historical turning points, we can see that Comrade Mao Zedong always took Marxism-Leninism as a guide for action, used it to guide the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and always proceeded from the overall strategic situation to solve a series of problems such as army building and combat. Comrade Mao Zedong systematically studied the laws of the Chinese revolutionary war. What is particularly important is that Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized in his military works the theoretical foundation and methodology of Marxist-Leninist military science, namely military dialectics. If we conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we can not only understand the knowledge of the laws concerning the overall situation of the war, so that we can remove blindness in military issues and achieve awareness, but also enable us to understand how to use flexible strategies and tactics according to different situations to achieve complete victory in combat, campaigns, and strategy.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army must conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's advanced military experience. We learned in the past, we learn now, and we will learn in the future. There are two ways to learn from the Soviet Union: one is a selective and creative way of learning, combining learning and application with China's specific conditions, which is the Marxist-Leninist way of learning. The other is a way of learning by copying everything without regard to specific circumstances, which is a dogmatic way of learning and is contrary to Marxism-Leninism. Dogmatism has caused serious losses in the history of the Chinese revolution, and we must oppose it. On the other hand, refusing or ignoring learning from Soviet experience is also completely wrong, which is a tendency of empiricism. Empiricism and dogmatism are both subjectivism. Using empiricism to oppose dogmatism will never succeed, and using dogmatism to oppose empiricism will not succeed either. We must oppose both. However, the view that we should selectively learn from Soviet experience on the basis of studying and summarizing our own experience is not empiricism, but a Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. We will use this method of learning to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries.

    Since the founding of New China, the achievements of the People's Liberation Army have been remarkable. During this period, it completed its combat and training tasks, defended and actively participated in socialist construction. The construction of the army itself, whether in terms of ideology, politics, organization, or equipment and technology, has achieved great results. However, some shortcomings have also occurred in the modernization construction of the People's Liberation Army. These shortcomings are the tendency of purely military viewpoints and neglecting ideological and political work, and the tendency of dogmatism and formalism, which have grown among some people. Although these shortcomings do not occupy a major position in the army as a whole, they have already had some adverse effects on the relationship between the army and the people. Through the Party's Eighth National Congress, the rectification movement since last year, and especially the expanded meeting of the Central Military Commission from May to July 1958, these shortcomings have been fundamentally overcome. The leadership method of the mass line is being further implemented in the troops and has been newly developed. Leading cadres at all levels go deep into the company to "cultivate experimental plots," working, studying, and living with the soldiers on an equal footing in order to discover problems, gain experience, and use them to improve their work. The soldiers said: "The rectification has boundless power, the officers' work style has greatly changed, the soldiers don't eat, the officers don't swallow, the soldiers don't sleep, the officers don't sleep." This method of "cultivating experimental plots" is a new development of the Party's mass line method and is the best leadership method to ensure the unity of officers and soldiers, the unity of superiors and subordinates, and the unity of the army and the people in the People's Army, and to ensure the combination of leaders and the masses. Repeated rectifications have proved that if the error of purely military viewpoints is committed, the troops will become rigid and lifeless; if purely military viewpoints are overthrown, the Party's leadership is strengthened, and the style of the mass line is promoted, the entire army will sweep away the dull atmosphere, become invigorated, and become high in morale. The current task of the People's Liberation Army is, on the basis of the victory of the rectification, to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's thought and his military theories, implement the Party's correct military line, liberate thought, break superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and rapidly complete the task of modernization construction with the working method of the mass line. The working method of the mass line is the key to all our victories: applying it to the Chinese revolution, the revolution will be victorious; applying it to socialist economic construction, industry, agriculture, transportation, and other industries will have an unprecedented great leap forward; applying it to cultural and educational undertakings, culture and education will flourish; similarly, applying it to military work, military work will surely appear in a lively new situation.

    Now the people of the world demand peace and demand that countries with different social systems practice peaceful coexistence. Standing at the forefront of defending peace is the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and the vanguard of the international working class united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism – the communist parties of all countries. At the same time, the people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who strive for independence and freedom from imperialist aggression, and the people of all countries who love peace and oppose new wars, are also becoming stronger and stronger. But imperialism has still not abandoned its plan to create a new war. U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan and is still surrounding us with a series of military bases in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. U.S. and British imperialism are carrying out military adventures in the Middle East, armed intervention in the liberation struggle of the Arab people, and the peace of the Middle East and the world is being seriously threatened. The people of the world must be vigilant, smash the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, and be prepared to completely crush the aggressors' offensive and completely eliminate the creators of war – the imperialist system – when imperialism dares to launch a war. Under these circumstances, vigorously strengthening our national defense and strengthening our strength to defend the motherland and defend peace is an urgent task for our entire Party, entire army, and entire people. Let us unite under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and strive to build the People's Liberation Army into an excellent and modern revolutionary army that includes a powerful army, a powerful air force, and a powerful navy in the shortest possible time.

    人民军队　人民战争
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军三十一周年
    朱德
    人民解放军是人民的军队。地主、资本家是不允许人民有军队的，所以人民解放军一诞生，反动军队就天天打，天天围攻。但是这支军队有了共产党领导，有了无产阶级的政治挂帅，有了人民拥护，就不仅没有被消灭，而且越打越大，越战越强，终于历尽千辛万苦，取得了全国的胜利。
    无产阶级军队绝对服从无产阶级利益的最忠实的代表者——共产党的领导，是无产阶级军队建设的基本原则。中国共产党在领导革命武装斗争的几十年中，坚持并发展了这个原则，建立了党领导军队的一整套制度。这就是党委集体领导和首长分工负责相结合的制度、政治委员制度、政治工作制度等等。建立这些制度的目的，就是为了保证人民解放军的革命性质，保证人民解放军在任何时候都有一个鲜明的政治方向和奋斗目标，保证不断地提高全体官兵的阶级觉悟，使人民解放军成为一支打不垮、压不倒，战无不胜、攻无不克的军队。
  群众路线是我们党的一切工作的根本路线，军事工作当然也不例外。在军事工作方面走群众路线，就是承认依靠士兵群众和人民群众的充分支持，是取得战争胜利的根本保证。从这个观点出发，人民解放军在党的领导下，几十年来建立了一整套的制度和原则。这就是三大纪律八项注意，军队担负打仗、生产、做群众工作三项任务，政治上官兵平等，在部队内实行政治民主、经济民主、军事民主等等。实行这些制度和原则，保证了军队和人民之间，军队内部的上下级之间和官兵之间的密切联系，发扬了群众的首创精神，成为人民解放军克服困难、取得胜利的无穷无尽的力量源泉。
    近十几年来，军事技术有了迅速的发展。可不可以说，由于军事技术的迅速发展，今后就再不是首先要依靠政治挂帅，而是单纯依靠技术呢？不是的，不管军事技术如何发展，政治挂帅的经验是绝不会过时的。当然，在未来的战争中，对新式技术装备的意义，必须给以极大的重视。但是，我们不是唯武器论者。我们认为，最后决定战争胜负的不是技术，而是政治，而是政治制度和人心的向背。任何技术都是服务于一定的政治的，任何技术都是由人创造、由人发展、由人掌握的。抱单纯军事观点的人，片面地重视军事而轻视政治；片面地重视业务、重视技术而轻视思想；片面地重视个人的作用而忽视党和群众的集体力量；只讲战术技术，不讲战略；只要军队，而忽视人民群众的作用；只注意国防建设，不注意经济建设对于国防建设的意义。这在实质上是资产阶级的军事思想的一种表现。是违反马克思列宁主义的。他们主张不要政治挂帅，其实没有无产阶级的政治挂帅，就必然是资产阶级的政治挂帅。
    中国共产党的大部分历史，就是领导革命的武装斗争的历史。我们党领导革命武装斗争的经验是极其丰富的。毛泽东同志的军事思想，代表了中国共产党正确的军事路线，集中了中国革命战争丰富的经验。毛泽东同志在领导我国的民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利过程中，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理来指导中国革命实践，根据我国的条件，从革命问题到社会主义建设问题光辉地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东同志把辩证唯物主义用于指导革命战争，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的军事科学，这就是人民军队的建设路线和人民战争的战略战术思想。它已经胜利地经历了二十多年革命战争和三年抗美援朝战争的考验；在今后，它还将指导中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的新的斗争中达到胜利。
    毛泽东同志的军事思想之所以战无不胜，在于它是彻底辩证唯物主义的，是完全马克思列宁主义的。当1927年革命失败，转到由共产党独立领导中国民主革命运动的时候，毛泽东同志的两篇最早的军事著作，即“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”和“井冈山的斗争”，对于我国当时的革命斗争的这个战略转变，起了重大的指导作用。
    从井冈山斗争开始，到1929年12月红军第四军第九次党代表大会止，形成了以毛泽东同志为代表的党的正确军事路线。红军第四军第九次党代表大会的决议奠定了中国人民解放军的建军原则，这些原则至今仍然适用。由于有了这条正确路线，就使革命战争不断地取得胜利，革命根据地不断扩大。但是由于“左”倾机会主义者反对毛泽东同志的这条正确路线，曾经使得革命战争受过一度挫折。毛泽东同志的“中国革命战争的战略问题”一书，系统地总结了这个历史时期丰富的革命战争经验。当由土地革命战争转到抗日战争的时候，我党又以毛泽东同志的“论持久战”和“抗日游击战争的战略问题”中所阐明的思想为指针，实现了当时的战略转变，并且由于贯彻执行了毛泽东同志的这一指导思想，不断地取得了抗日战争的胜利，形成了强大的人民军队。抗日战争结束以后，蒋介石集团再次发动全面内战的时候，毛泽东同志又引导我们实现了新的战略转变，以“十项军事原则”指导中国人民解放战争取得了全国胜利。在所有这些历史转变关头，我们可以看到，毛泽东同志都是把马克思列宁主义作为行动的指针，用以指导中国革命的具体实践，都是从战略的全局出发，来解决建军、作战等一系列的问题。毛泽东同志系统地研究了中国革命战争的规律。特别重要的是毛泽东同志在他的军事著作中，着重发展了马克思列宁主义军事科学的理论基础和方法论，即军事辩证法。我们认真地学习毛泽东同志的这些著作，不仅能够使我们懂得有关战争全局的规律的知识，使我们在军事问题上去掉盲目性，取得自觉性，而且能够使我们懂得按照不同的情况，运用灵活的战略战术，达到战斗、战役和战略的全部胜利。
    中国人民解放军必须认真学习苏联的先进军事经验。过去学，现在学，将来也要学。学习苏联有两种学习方法：一种是有选择、有创造的学习方法，学和用的时候结合中国的具体情况，这是马克思列宁主义的学习方法。一种是不问具体情况，一律照搬的学习方法，这是教条主义的学习方法，是违反马克思列宁主义的。教条主义在中国革命历史上曾经造成过严重的损失，是我们必须反对的。另一方面，拒绝或忽视学习苏联经验，也是完全错误的，这是经验主义的倾向。经验主义和教条主义都是主观主义，用经验主义反对教条主义永远反对不了，用教条主义反对经验主义也是反对不了，两者我们都要反对。但是主张在研究总结我们自己的经验的基础上，有选择地学习苏联经验的观点，却不是经验主义，而是马克思列宁主义的观点。我们就是要用这种学习方法，来学习苏联的先进经验以及其他国家的经验。
    新中国成立以来，人民解放军的成绩是显著的。在这个期间，它完成了作战和训练的任务，保卫并积极参加了社会主义的建设。军队本身的建设，无论在思想上、政治上、组织上和装备技术上，都获得了巨大的成绩。但是人民解放军在现代化建设中也发生了一些缺点。这些缺点，就是单纯军事观点和忽视思想政治工作的倾向，教条主义和形式主义的倾向，在一部分人中有了滋长。这些缺点，在全军来说，虽然不占主要地位，但对军队内部和军民之间的关系，已经产生了一些不利的影响。经过党的第八次代表大会，经过去年以来的整风运动，特别是经过1958年5月至7月的中央军委扩大会议，这些缺点，已经在根本上被克服下去了。群众路线的领导方法，在部队中正在进一步得到贯彻，并且有了新的发展。各级领导干部深入连队“种试验田”，完全以平等的态度和战士一起劳动、学习和生活，以便发现问题，取得经验，用来改进工作。战士们说：“整风效力大无边，军官作风大改变，兵不吃饭官不咽，兵不入睡官不眠。”这种“种试验田”的方法，是党的群众路线方法的新发展，是保证人民军队的官兵一致、上下一致、军民一致，保证领导和群众相结合的最好的领导方法。多次整风证明，犯了单纯军事观点的错误，部队就死板僵化，毫无生气；反掉了单纯军事观点，加强了党的领导，发扬了群众路线的作风，全军上下就一扫沉闷空气，精神振奋，斗志昂扬。目前人民解放军的任务，就是在整风胜利的基础上，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，认真地学习毛泽东同志的思想和他的军事学说，贯彻执行党的正确的军事路线，解放思想，破除迷信，敢想、敢说、敢做，用群众路线的工作方法迅速地完成现代化的建设任务。群众路线的工作方法是我们一切胜利的钥匙：把它运用到中国革命，革命就胜利；把它运用到社会主义经济建设，工业、农业、交通运输业等就出现空前规模的大跃进；把它运用到文化教育事业方面，文化教育就蓬勃发展；同样，把它运用到军事工作方面来，军事工作也就一定会出现一个生动活泼的新局面。
    现在全世界人民要求和平，要求不同社会制度的国家实行和平共处。站在保卫和平的最前线的是以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下团结一致的国际工人阶级的先锋队——各国共产党。同时，力求从帝国主义侵略下争取独立自由的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的各国人民，爱好和平、反对新战争的各国人民，力量也愈来愈强大。但是帝国主义仍然没有放弃制造新战争的计划。美帝国主义还在霸占着我国的领土台湾，还在南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾用一系列的军事基地包围着我们。美英帝国主义正在中东进行军事冒险，武装干涉阿拉伯人民的解放斗争，中东和世界的和平正在受到严重的威胁。全世界的人民必须提高警惕，击破帝国主义侵略者的战争阴谋，并且准备在帝国主义胆敢发动战争的时候彻底粉碎侵略者的进攻，彻底消灭战争的制造者——帝国主义制度。在这种情况下，大力加强我们的国防，加强我们保卫祖国、保卫和平的力量，是我们全党、全军、全民的迫切任务。让我们团结在党中央的领导下，为在最短时间内把人民解放军建成为包括强大的陆军、强大的空军、强大的海军的一支优良的、现代化的革命军队而奋斗。
