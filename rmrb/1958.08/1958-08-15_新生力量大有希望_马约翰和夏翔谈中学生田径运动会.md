　　New Forces Hold Great Promise
　　——Ma John and Xia Xiang Discuss Middle School Track and Field Games
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Bi Wanzhao, Fu Hongde
　　On the eve of the closing of the National Middle School Students' Track and Field Games, prominent figures in the sports world, Professor Ma John and Professor Xia Xiang, spoke to reporters about their feelings on attending the games. They both agreed that the games were very successful, and the young athletes have already achieved many excellent results. In the short few years since liberation, the level of sports among middle school students in our country has been able to achieve such rapid development, which is the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's concern for sports and people's health.

　　Seventy-seven-year-old Professor Ma John is the chief referee of this games. The extraordinary achievements that have emerged in the past few days have rejuvenated this old man. Whether it is at noon under the scorching sun or in the windy and rainy evenings, he is always busy on the field, carefully watching the figures and movements of these young athletes. Professor Ma excitedly told reporters that after careful observation these past few days, he discovered many athletes with great potential for cultivation. The progress of women's sports is even more encouraging. Who would have thought that a little girl of only seventeen years old would be able to jump over a height of 1.58 meters. He said: The level of sports among college students before liberation was really not as good as these sixteen- and seventeen-year-old middle school students.

　　Professor Xia Xiang, the deputy chief referee of the games, gave reporters a detailed introduction to some of the gratifying phenomena that have emerged at this games. He said: Judging from the games these past few days, it proves that the physique of our new generation has been greatly enhanced, and the athletes are fully prepared for training. For example, the athletes participating in the men's 1,500-meter and women's 400- and 800-meter races ran so easily, without any signs of discomfort. The phenomenon of two people helping each other walk after running, which was common in the past, is no longer seen at all. He said that from the perspective of athletic posture, the progress of female athletes is particularly rapid. Xia Xiang said that the athletes are all full of energy and full of vigor in striving for the top. Even if they fall to the last place in the race, they will run the entire course at the fastest speed.

　　When Professor Ma John and Professor Xia Xiang talked about some of the shortcomings they saw at this sports games, they believed that the students' sports technical level was still relatively poor. Some athletes have very good bodies and figures, and could have jumped higher and run faster, but because their skills are not proficient, they did not achieve the results they should have.

　　新生力量大有希望
　　——马约翰和夏翔谈中学生田径运动会
　　新华社记者　毕万兆　傅洪德
    在全国中等学校学生田径运动大会闭幕前夕，体育界著名人士马约翰教授和夏翔教授对记者谈了他们参加这次大会的感受。他们一致认为这次运动会开得很成功，年轻的运动员们已创造了很多优异的成绩。在解放以后的短短几年内，我国中学生的体育运动水平能获得这样飞跃的发展，是党和毛主席对体育运动和人民健康关怀的结果。
    七十七岁的马约翰教授是这次运动会的总裁判。这几天出现的一些不平凡的成绩，使这位老人的精神更加焕发。不论是烈日炎炎的中午，还是刮风下雨的傍晚，他总是终日奔波在比赛场上，仔细地观看这些年轻运动员的身形和动作。马老教授兴奋地对记者说：经过这几天的仔细观察，他发现了很多大有培养前途的运动员。女子体育运动的进展，令人更加鼓舞。谁会想到一个年仅十七岁的小毛丫头，竟会跳过一点五八公尺的高度。他说：解放前大学生的体育运动水平，还真不如这些十六、七岁的中学生呢。
    大会副总裁判夏翔教授对记者详细介绍了这次运动会上出现的一些可喜的现象。他说：从这几天的比赛来看，证明我国新生一代的体质已大大增强，运动员们都有充分的锻炼准备。如参加男子一千五百公尺、女子四百、八百公尺赛跑的运动员，跑下来是那样地轻松，没有一点不舒服的迹象。过去跑下来那种两人扶着走的现象根本看不到了。他说，从运动的姿式上看，女运动员的进步特别迅速。夏翔说，运动员们个个精力充沛，力争上游的劲头十足。在赛跑中即便是落到最后的一名，他们也要用最快的速度跑完全程。
    马约翰教授和夏翔教授在谈到这次运动大会上看到的一些缺点时，认为学生们的运动技术水平还较差。有些运动员的身体、身形都很好，本来可以跳得更高跑得更快，但因为技术不熟练，没有取得应有的成绩。
