The U.S. State Department released a so-called "Memorandum Regarding U.S. Policy on Non-Recognition of Communist China" on the 11th of this month. Although this memorandum is quite lengthy, its content is nothing more than a rehash of the old tune of Dulles and his ilk in their hostility towards China. In this memorandum, the U.S. State Department uses the most shameless lies and the most vicious words to slander and revile the Chinese people, and hysterically repeats the platitude of communist aggression to intimidate the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for independence and freedom.

In fact, it is not news to us that American imperialism extremely hates the Chinese people; the Chinese people have always despised American imperialism and have never craved American "recognition." So, why did the U.S. State Department publish the memorandum of non-recognition of China at this time? Originally, the U.S. government's China policy had long been in a dead end and was in a very isolated and embarrassing situation. The People's Republic of China has not only not "disappeared" from the world as Dulles cursed, but is also developing and growing at a speed unprecedented in human history. Due to the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction and the active contributions made to the cause of world peace, our country's international status and prestige are increasing day by day, the number of countries establishing diplomatic relations with China is increasing, and the number of people demanding recognition of China is also increasing. Especially recently, not only in peaceful and neutral countries, but also in Western countries such as Britain, France, and West Germany, as well as in the United States, public opinion is also demanding recognition of China and the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. At the same time, national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, and all oppressed nations and peoples in the world regard the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries as their most loyal friends, and the facts have also proved that the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries are the most resolute supporters of their struggle for independence and freedom. This situation further declares the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. policy towards China. This cannot but make the U.S. State Department issue a wail from the dead end. It wants to use this shouting method to cover up the failure of the U.S. policy towards China, and to try to maintain people's hearts, block the growing trend of many countries demanding recognition of China, and block the upsurge of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

However, the U.S. State Department's memorandum did not achieve this goal. After it was published, how many people in the vast world came out to applaud it? Pitiful! Pitiful! A United Press International reporter counted and found that only Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, South Vietnam, and the Philippines expressed "welcome." And the public opinion in India, Indonesia, Ceylon, and other Asian countries believes that it is "unfortunate" for the United States to publish such a thing now. We believe that the publication of this memorandum is also a good thing for the Chinese people, as well as the people of Asia and the world, because it further exposes the aggressive face and ambition of American imperialism.

The U.S. State Department put forward many "reasons" in the memorandum to explain why the United States opposes the recognition of China. First of all, the memorandum says: "There are some special considerations that affect the United States' policy on the issue of recognition," that is, the so-called "Republic of China" still "controls the strategic island of Taiwan." The memorandum blatantly states that the United States is determined to continue to support the dying "government" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique it has bought, to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and to use this base to carry out aggressive activities against China, so that those who oppose the People's Republic of China can "continue to have hope." The actual situation is certainly more than that. The reason why the United States wants to occupy China's Taiwan for a long time is also because it is using this "strategic island" as an important base for its aggressive activities in the entire Far East.

It is precisely because of this that the memorandum also wrote: "Non-recognition of Peiping (referring to the People's Republic of China), while continuing to recognize and support the Republic of China (referring to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique), facilitates the United States in achieving its policy goals in the Far East." What exactly are the "policy goals"? The memorandum says that the United States seems to be opposing the "expansion" of communism. However, the facts are the clearest. The U.S. claim to oppose communist "expansion" is not only a slander, but also a guise. It is under this guise that the United States is carrying out pervasive aggressive activities and colonial expansion in the Far East and throughout Asia. Under the guise of anti-communism, the United States has long occupied South Korea and South Vietnam, turning these places into its colonies. The United States has established hundreds of military bases in Japan, the Philippines, and other Asian countries, arbitrarily trampling on the sovereignty and independence of these countries. Under the guise of anti-communism, the United States organized the Southeast Asia Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty. These two treaties, as Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Egyptian President Nasser have pointed out, are aimed at having colonial countries "decide or control the fate of this vast Southeast Asian region," and at locking up the Arab people in a "large prison." The United States is using the means of organizing military blocs and "aid" to carry out its most arrogant colonialist plans, frantically plundering and extracting the natural resources and the blood and sweat of the people of many Asian and African countries. Under the guise of anti-communism, the United States also frequently uses force to interfere in or threaten national independence movements. It openly interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs, using the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Southeast Asia group to transport weapons and send pilots to support the Indonesian rebels. A month ago, the United States, under the guise of opposing "indirect aggression," sent troops to invade Lebanon, which is thousands of miles away from the U.S. mainland, and is still赖在那里不走. All these barbaric acts of aggression are the "policy goals" of the United States in the Far East and throughout Asia!

The U.S. State Department's memorandum attempts to fabricate all kinds of "crimes" for the Chinese people. Those lies are self-defeating. But one of them is true. The memorandum says that the Chinese people openly announced "active support for the national independence and liberation movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries," and the U.S. State Department sees this as a heinous crime. But, we want to ask the U.S. State Department, why do you oppose the Chinese people's support for national independence movements? Doesn't this exactly prove that you are using the guise of opposing communism, but in fact, you are opposing the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America! Isn't this exactly admitting that you are ferocious colonialists!

The U.S. State Department's memorandum says that the basic consideration for the United States' non-recognition of the People's Republic of China is the fear that Asian countries neighboring China cannot withstand the so-called "communist aggression." The actual situation is exactly the opposite. China has established and is developing friendly relations with many neighbouring countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It is the United States that is invading these countries. Now the problem is that the United States' aggressive policy can no longer withstand the surging national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, so it has to re-raise the already tattered banner of opposing "communist aggression."

The U.S. State Department is terrified and makes a big fuss about the issue of non-recognition of China, and vigorously proclaims that this has become a "tool of U.S. national policy." This hysterical clamoring of the U.S. State Department can only arouse the extreme contempt of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are building their own country according to their own will, and they are not interested in whether the United States recognizes our country or not. Dulles and his ilk fantasize that the People's China regime will "one day disappear," stubbornly adhere to the policy of hostility towards China and non-recognition of China, thinking that this can "accelerate this process of disappearance," and create "definite obstacles" to the improvement of China's international status and prestige. This is a complete fool's dream. The history of the past eight years and more has proved this point, and the future development of history will continue to prove this point.

If the U.S. policy of non-recognition of China has played any role for us, it is only to make our people see more clearly that the U.S. ruling clique is the center of all reactionary forces in the world today, and the mortal enemy of all people in the world who safeguard independence and peace. This can only greatly inspire our people to work harder, go all out, and accelerate the construction of our great motherland. As for what role the U.S. policy of non-recognition of China plays internationally, it is only to make its own situation increasingly isolated. The U.S. stubborn practice of being hostile to China and unreasonably obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations is not popular in Asian and African countries, a point that even the U.S. State Department's memorandum cannot deny, and even in Western countries, the so-called close partners of the United States, it is increasingly causing dissatisfaction and complaints. British newspapers and public opinion ridiculed the United States' insistence on having the Chiang Kai-shek clique "act as counterfeit representatives to occupy China's seat in the United Nations" as buying "dead souls" ("Sunday Pictorial"), and believed that "it is impossible to solve world problems while excluding China from the United Nations" ("Daily Herald"). The United States' stubborn refusal to recognize China cannot harm China's increasing international prestige in the slightest. On the contrary, it can only increasingly expose its ferocious face of refusing peaceful coexistence and inciting international tension in front of the people of the world.

The United States wants to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan under the guise of not recognizing China, and use it as a springboard for its further aggression against our country and other Asian countries. This is also a completely overestimating dream. In order to achieve its goal of occupying Taiwan, the United States has tried its best to create the conspiracy of "two Chinas" at many international conferences. Now the U.S. State Department's memorandum actually admits that the "two Chinas" proposition has gone bankrupt, which is indeed a "ironic" thing. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. We will never tolerate the long-term occupation of Taiwan by the United States! Liberating Taiwan is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people. We have the determination and the strength to liberate our last piece of land. The aggressive policy of American imperialism can never stop the Chinese people from realizing the reunification of their motherland and the progress of building their motherland.

### 美国侵略者的旧调可以休矣

　　美国侵略者的旧调可以休矣
    美国国务院在本月11日公布了一份所谓“关于不承认共产党中国政策的备忘录”。这个备忘录虽然十分冗长，但其内容却不过是杜勒斯之流敌视中国的旧调重弹。在这个备忘录中，美国国务院用最无耻的谎言和最恶毒的字句，对中国人民进行污蔑和谩骂，并且歇斯底里地重复着共产主义侵略的滥调，来恐吓亚、非、拉丁美洲争取独立和自由的人民。
    其实，美帝国主义极端仇视中国人民，这对我们来说并不是什么新闻；中国人民从来鄙视美帝国主义，从来也不希罕美国的“承认”。那么，美国国务院究竟为什么要在这个时候发表不承认中国的备忘录呢？原来，美国政府的对华政策，早就走进了死胡同，陷入了十分孤立和难堪的境地。中华人民共和国不但没有像杜勒斯所诅咒的那样从世界上“消逝”，而且正以人类历史上从来没有过的速度发展壮大着。由于中国人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的伟大成就，和对于世界和平事业所作的积极贡献，我国的国际地位和威望正日益提高，和中国建交的国家正在增多，要求承认中国的人们也正增多。特别是最近期间，不仅在和平中立国家，而且在英国、法国、西德等西方国家以及美国国内，广大舆论也都要求承认中国并恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。同时，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动风起云涌，世界上一切被压迫的民族和人民把苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家都看做是他们最忠实的朋友，而事实也证明了：苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家是他们争取独立、自由的斗争中最坚决的支持者。这种形势进一步宣告了美国对华政策的彻底破产。这就不能不使美国国务院从死胡同里发出了悲鸣。它想用这种大喊大叫的办法来掩盖美国对华政策的失败，并竭力维系人心，阻挡许多国家要求承认中国的日益增长的趋势，阻挡亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的高涨。
    但是，美国国务院的备忘录并没有达到这个目的。当它发表以后，在偌大的世界上究竟有几个人出来叫好呢？可怜！可怜！合众国际社记者数了一下，只有蒋介石、李承晚、南越和菲律宾表示“欢迎”。而印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰和其他亚洲国家的舆论，则认为美国在现在发表这样一篇东西是“不幸的”。我们认为，这篇备忘录的发表，对于中国人民以及亚洲人民和世界人民来说，倒也是一件好事，因为它进一步暴露了美帝国主义的侵略面目和野心。
    美国国务院在备忘录里提出了许多“理由”，说明美国为什么要反对承认中国。首先，备忘录说：“有一些特别的考虑影响美国关于承认问题的政策”，那就是所谓
  “中华民国”仍然“控制着战略性的岛屿台湾”。备忘录露骨地表示，美国决心继续支持它所收买的蒋介石集团的死魂灵“政府”，继续霸占我国领土台湾，并利用这个基地来进行对中国的侵略活动，以便使那些反对中华人民共和国的人“继续怀抱希望”。实际情况当然不止如此。美国所以妄想长期霸占中国的台湾，还因为它正在把这个“战略性的岛屿”作为它在整个远东进行侵略活动的重要基地。
    正是因为这样，备忘录又写道：“不承认北平（指中华人民共和国），同时继续承认和支持中华民国（指台湾蒋介石集团），这就便于美国达到在远东的政策目标”。究竟是什么
  “政策目标”呢？备忘录说，美国似乎是要反对共产主义的“扩张”。但是，事实是最清楚的。美国所谓反对共产主义“扩张”的说法，不但是一种诬蔑，而且是一种幌子。就是在这个幌子下，美国在远东以及整个亚洲，进行着无孔不入的侵略活动和殖民扩张。在反共的幌子下，美国长期侵占着南朝鲜和南越，把这些地方变为它的殖民地。美国在日本、菲律宾和其他亚洲国家的领土上建立了几百个军事基地，任意蹂躏这些国家的主权和独立。在反共的幌子下，美国组织了东南亚条约和巴格达条约。这两个条约，正如印度总理尼赫鲁和埃及总统纳赛尔曾经指出的，它的目的是要由殖民国家来“决定或控制这个广大的东南亚地区的命运”，是要把阿拉伯人民关进一座“大监牢”。美国就是利用组织军事集团和“援助”等等手段，来推行它的最狂妄的殖民主义计划，疯狂地掠夺和榨取许多亚非国家的天然资源和人民的血汗。在反共的幌子下，美国并且经常以武力来干涉或威胁民族独立运动。它公然干涉印度尼西亚的内政，利用台湾蒋介石集团和东南亚集团，运送武器并派遣飞行员去支援印度尼西亚的叛军。一个月以前，美国又打着反对“间接侵略”的幌子，出兵侵占了远在美国本土万里之外的黎巴嫩，至今还赖在那里不走。所有这一切野蛮的侵略行动，也就是美国在远东以及整个亚洲的“政策目标”！
    美国国务院的备忘录企图给中国人民捏造种种“罪状”。那些谎言是不攻自破的。但是其中有一条倒是事实。备忘录说，中国人民公然宣布“积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族独立和解放运动”，美国国务院把这看作是罪大恶极。可是，我们倒要问问美国国务院，中国人民支持民族独立运动，为什么你们也要反对呢？这不是恰恰证明了你们打着的是反对共产主义的幌子，而实际上是反对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动吗！这不是恰恰供认了你们是凶恶的殖民主义者吗！
    美国国务院的备忘录说，美国不承认中华人民共和国的基本考虑是害怕邻近中国的亚洲国家抵挡不住所谓“共产主义的侵略”。实际情况正好相反，中国在和平共处五项原则的基础上同许多邻近国家建立并且正在发展着友好关系。侵略这些国家的正是美国。现在问题是，美国的侵略政策已经抵挡不住亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动了，因此它才要重新祭起这个早已破烂不堪的所谓反对“共产主义侵略”的旗子。
    美国国务院心惊胆战地在不承认中国的问题上大作文章，并且大肆宣扬这已成为美国“国家政策的工具”。美国国务院的这种歇斯底里的叫嚷，只能引起中国人民的极端鄙视。中国人民按照自己的意志建设着自己的国家，对于美国是不是承认我国丝毫也不感到兴趣。杜勒斯之流幻想人民中国政权“有朝一日总会消失”，顽固地坚持敌视中国、不承认中国的政策，以为这样就可以“加速这种消失的过程”，并且对中国国际地位和威望的提高造成“肯定的障碍”，这是十足的痴人说梦。新中国巩固着、发展着，国际威望也在一天天提高着，不管美国装聋卖傻也好，恼怒暴跳也好，它都改变不了这个客观事实。过去八年多的历史证明了这点，今后的历史发展还会继续证明这点。
    如果说美国不承认中国的政策对我们起了什么作用的话，那只是使我国人民更加看清美国统治集团是今天世界上一切反动势力的中心，是今天世界上一切维护独立、和平的人民的死敌。这只能大大激发我国人民更加奋发图强，鼓足干劲，加速地建设我们伟大的祖国。至于说美国不承认中国的政策在国际上有什么作用的话，那也只是使它自己的处境越来越孤立。美国敌视中国、无理阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位的死硬作法，不仅在亚非国家中不得人心，这点连美国国务院的备忘录也不能否认，即使在西方国家，美国的所谓亲密伙伴中，也日益引起不满和抱怨。英国报刊舆论就把美国坚持由蒋介石集团“充任冒牌的代表来占据中国在联合国的地位”，讥笑为收买“死魂灵”（“星期日画报”），并且认为“在把中国排斥在联合国之外的情况下想要解决世界问题是不可能的”（“每日先驱报”）。美国顽固地拒绝承认中国，对于中国的日益增高的国际威信丝毫不能有所损害，相反的，却只能在全世界人民面前日益暴露它拒绝和平共处、煽动国际紧张局势的穷凶极恶的面貌。
    美国想在不承认中国的幌子下，继续霸占我国的领土台湾，并作为它进一步侵略我国和其他亚洲国家的跳板，这也完全是不自量力的梦想。为了实现它侵占台湾的目的，美国曾在许多国际会议上极力制造“两个中国”的阴谋。现在美国国务院的备忘录居然也承认“两个中国”的主张破产了，这的确是“具有讽刺意味”的事情。台湾是中国不可分割的领土的一部分。我们绝不能容忍美国长期霸占台湾！解放台湾是中国人民的神圣责任。我们有决心也有力量解放自己的最后一片国土。美国帝国主义的侵略政策绝对阻止不住中国人民实现祖国统一和建设祖国的前进步伐。
