Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Following is the full text of the speech delivered by Li Jooyun, head of the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Deputy Premier of the Korean Cabinet, at the reception held to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea by the Soviet Army:

	Dear Comrade Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai,
	Distinguished guests,

	Today, the Korean people, in an environment of extremely high political enthusiasm and labor struggle for socialist construction, are welcoming the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from the shackles of Japanese imperialism by the great Soviet Army on August 15th. On this festive occasion for the whole nation, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and respect to the Soviet Army and the Soviet people, the true liberators and helpers of the Korean people.

	After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people inherited the glorious revolutionary tradition of staunch and loyal communists fighting for national independence, and achieved great victories in peaceful construction and in the arduous struggle against the US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man clique. At present, they are overcoming numerous difficulties and achieving brilliant successes in the socialist construction cause of our country.

	The Korean people, who defeated the armed aggression of US imperialism in the great Fatherland Liberation War, based on the successful completion of the three-year people's economic recovery plan after the war, began to implement the basic policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while rapidly developing light industry and agriculture, consolidating the socialist economic foundation, and basically solving the people's problems of food, clothing and housing during the first five-year plan. Now, all sectors have embarked on the Chollima, galloping bravely towards socialism.

	We have completed the first year of the Five-Year Plan—1957—by 117%, and in the process of implementing the plan in the first half of 1958, we exceeded the total industrial output value by 110%.

	Since our Five-Year Plan is being implemented under the conditions that 98.7% of the total industrial output value comes from state-owned industrial enterprises and 98.6% of all farmers have joined cooperatives, there is no doubt that our productive forces will develop even more rapidly in the future.

	The Korean people clearly understand that the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people through their own struggles are inseparable from the active support and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of all socialist brother countries, the liberator of the Korean people.

	However, South Korea under the rule of US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man clique has been completely reduced to a colony of US imperialism and a fascist police state that does not allow the people the slightest democratic rights. Today, the so-called "aid" of US imperialism to the Lee Seung-man clique has turned South Korea into a dark world where 3.8 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people and more than 3 million starving farmers are struggling on the verge of starvation, and hundreds of thousands of children, including more than 200,000 orphans, are wandering the streets, and it has become a military aggression base for US imperialism to launch a new war. The US aggressive forces occupying South Korea are killing, insulting and plundering lawlessly in all areas of South Korea every day, threatening the lives of the people at all times.

	Not only that, but in just the recent period, the US imperialist executioners, frantically attempting to launch a war, have continued to blatantly trample on the Korean Armistice Agreement, transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, and even establishing missile bases, openly instigating military provocations along the 38th parallel.

	Therefore, the US imperialist occupation of South Korea has become the root cause of all the misfortunes of the Korean people.

	The Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have made every effort to realize the wishes of all the Korean people, to make the United States troops withdraw from South Korea, and to peacefully reunify their motherland. In particular, the governments of Korea and China issued a joint statement, advocating that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea in order to open a new situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, while the Chinese People's Volunteers have already taken the initiative to begin withdrawing from Korea and have completed the second withdrawal of troops.

	Under such circumstances, the US military has no reason to remain in South Korea. The continued occupation of South Korea by the US military only more blatantly exposes the aggressive nature of US imperialism.

	We believe that only the withdrawal of US aggressive troops is the only way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and we strongly advocate that US troops should immediately withdraw from Korea.

	Dear friends!

	US imperialism, which vainly attempts to dominate the world, is currently not only doing so in Korea, but also arbitrarily engaging in armed intervention in the struggle of the people of the Middle East and Arab countries for national independence and freedom, further exposing itself to the people of the world as an implacable and vicious enemy of peace and the national liberation movement.

	The Korean people believe through their own practical experience that: today, unless the US and British aggressive forces withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, the threat of war in the Middle East cannot be eliminated; in order to drive away the US and British aggressive forces, the unity of the Arab people and the active support of the peace camp are needed.

	For this reason, the Korean people support the various active measures taken by the Soviet government to eliminate the danger of war in the Middle East, and fully support the content of the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev recently held in Beijing, believing that this statement is the most severe warning to the US and British imperialism, which are trying to drag mankind into a new war, and is a great source of encouragement to the people of the world for peace.

	Our government has issued a statement fully supporting the Soviet proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations to make the US and British aggressive forces immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan and restore peace in the Middle East.

	The Korean people actively support the just struggle of the Asian and African people for national independence and freedom, and will strengthen their friendly unity with them, and will fight to the end together with the peace-loving people of the world to stop imperialist aggression.

	Dear comrades, friends!

	Today, the power of socialist countries has greatly surpassed the strength of imperialist countries. The further strengthening and development of the solid unity and solidarity of the socialist camp has become a strong guarantee for maintaining world peace and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

	Therefore, we cherish the unity between the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as we cherish the apple of our eye, and strengthen the uncompromising struggle, resolutely oppose modern revisionism that conspires to split the international communist movement and serves imperialism. At the same time, we must adhere to the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and continue to fight for the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

	As everyone knows, the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China has become a model of proletarian internationalism. Through the long struggle against Japanese imperialism, especially during the three-year Fatherland Liberation War against the US imperialist aggressors, the people of Korea and China, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder to crush the aggression and achieve brilliant victory. During the post-war recovery and construction period, the fraternal Chinese people again provided huge material and technical assistance, such as 800 million yuan of free assistance, which further strengthened the confidence of the Korean people in building socialism. To this end, the entire Korean people express their infinite respect and gratitude to the Chinese people.

	In particular, the visit to Korea in February this year by the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China headed by Premier Zhou Enlai not only strengthened the long-standing fraternal friendly relations between the people of Korea and China, but also was an event of great historical significance in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and further consolidating and developing the cooperative relations between the two countries.

	The Korean people will continue to work to further strengthen the friendly unity between Korea and China in accordance with the basic principles enunciated in the joint statement of the governments of Korea and China.

	The Korean government delegation, which visited China this time to discuss long-term economic issues between Korea and China, was deeply moved by the brilliant achievements made by the infinitely wise Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government in the great leap forward in all aspects of socialist construction, and was as happy as if it were their own affairs. We are confident that in the near future, the Chinese people will surpass the level of British and American capitalism and become one of the richest and strongest countries in the world.

	The Korean people are confidently of the opinion that this situation will further expand and strengthen our two countries' cooperation in political, economic, cultural and all other sectors, and will have a positive impact on the successful construction of socialism by the Korean people embarking on the Chollima and the peaceful reunification of Korea.

	I propose a toast:

	To the happiness and prosperity of the great Chinese people who have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction,
	To the fraternal friendship and unity of the people of Korea and China forged with blood,
	To the friendship and unity between the people of all socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,
	To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the great Chinese people,
	To world peace!

### 朝鲜政府代表团团长李周渊的讲话

　　朝鲜政府代表团团长李周渊的讲话
    新华社15日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团团长、朝鲜内阁副首相李周渊在为庆祝苏联军队解放朝鲜十三周年举行的招待会上的讲话，全文如下：
    亲爱的国务院总理周恩来同志，
    各位来宾：
    今天，朝鲜人民在建设社会主义的政治热情和劳动斗争极其高涨的环境中迎接伟大的苏联军队从日本帝国主义统治桎梏下解放朝鲜的八·一五十三周年。值此全民的节日，我们谨向朝鲜人民真正的解放者和援助者苏联军队和苏联人民表示衷心的谢意和敬意。
    解放以后，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府正确领导下，继承了坚强、忠实的共产主义者争取民族独立斗争的光荣革命传统，在和平建设和反对美帝国主义及李承晚匪帮的残酷的斗争中取得了巨大的胜利，目前则正在我国的社会主义建设事业中克服重重难关，取得辉煌的成就。
    在伟大的祖国解放战争中战胜了美帝国主义武装侵略的朝鲜人民，以战后三年人民经济恢复计划的成功完成为基础，又开始实行坚持党优先发展重工业同时迅速发展轻工业和农业的基本方针，巩固社会主义经济基础，基本上解决人民衣食住问题的第一个五年计划。现在各个部门都已经跨上千里马，向着社会主义勇猛奔驰。
    我们已经以117％完成了五年计划的第一年——1957年的计划，在1958年上半年执行计划过程中，又以110％超额完成了工业生产总值。
    由于我国的五年计划是在工业生产总值的98.7％产生自国营工业企业以及全体农户的98.6％已经加入合作社的条件下实行的，因此毫无疑问，今后我国的生产力将会得到更加迅速的发展。
    朝鲜人民清楚地了解，朝鲜人民通过自己的斗争所取得的辉煌成就，是同朝鲜人民的解放者伟大的苏联，同中华人民共和国和各社会主义兄弟国家人民的积极支持和无私援助分不开的。
    但是，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮统治下的南朝鲜，已经完全沦为美帝国主义的殖民地，沦为不容许人民有丝毫民主权利的法西斯警察国家。今天，美帝国主义对李承晚匪帮的所谓“援助”，已经使南朝鲜变成有三百八十万失业和半失业者、三百多万绝粮农民挣扎在饥饿线上，包括二十多万孤儿在内的几十万儿童流浪在街头的黑暗天地，并且变成了美帝国主义发动新战争的军事侵略基地。侵占着南朝鲜的美国侵略军队每天都在南朝鲜所有地区无法无天地屠杀、凌辱和掠夺，每时每刻都在威胁人民的生命。
    不仅如此，只是最近一个时期，疯狂地妄图发动战争的美帝国主义刽子手就继续不断粗暴地蹂躏朝鲜停战协定，把原子武器运入南朝鲜，甚至建立导弹基地，露骨地在三八线策动军事挑衅。
    因此，美帝国主义强占南朝鲜，已经成为朝鲜人民一切不幸的根源。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府，为实现全体朝鲜人民的愿望，使美国军队撤出南朝鲜，和平统一自己的祖国，做了一切努力。尤其是朝中两国政府发表了联合声明，为了打开和平解决朝鲜问题的新局面，主张一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，而中国人民志愿军则已经主动开始撤离朝鲜，并完成了第二次撤兵。
    在这样的情况下，美国军队更没有任何理由留驻南朝鲜。美国军队继续强占南朝鲜，只有更加露骨地暴露美帝国主义的侵略本质。
    我们认为，只有撤出美国侵略军队，才是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一途径，并强硬地主张美国军队应当立即撤出朝鲜。
    亲爱的各位！
    妄想称霸世界的美帝国主义，目前不仅在朝鲜如此，而且还恣意武装干涉中近东和阿拉伯人民争取民族独立和自由的斗争，在全世界人民面前更加清楚地暴露出它是和平和民族解放运动不共戴天的凶恶的死敌。
    朝鲜人民通过自己的实际体验，认为：今天美、英侵略军队不撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，中近东的战争威胁就不可能消除；为了把美、英侵略军队赶走，就需要阿拉伯人民的团结和和平阵营的积极支持。
    正因为如此，朝鲜人民支持苏联政府为消除中近东战争危险而采取的各种积极措施，并完全支持最近在北京举行的毛泽东主席和赫鲁晓夫部长会议主席会谈的公报的内容，认为这一声明是对企图把人类拖进新战争中去的美、英帝国主义的最严厉的警告，是世界人民对于和平的巨大的鼓舞力量。
    我国政府已经发表声明，完全支持苏联关于召开联合国紧急特别会议使美、英侵略军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，恢复中近东和平的建议。
    朝鲜人民积极支持亚非人民争取民族独立和自由的正义斗争，并将加强同他们的友好团结，和全世界爱好和平人民一道，为制止帝国主义侵略而斗争到底。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，社会主义国家的威力已经大大超过了帝国主义国家的力量。社会主义阵营国家巩固的统一和团结的进一步加强和发展，已经成为维护世界和平和和平解决朝鲜问题的坚强保证。
    因此，我们像珍惜自己的眼珠一样珍惜以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的团结，并加强毫不妥协的斗争，坚决反对阴谋分裂国际共产主义运动、为帝国主义服务的现代修正主义。同时。还要坚持各国共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言的原则，为马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而继续斗争。
    大家知道，朝中两国人民之间的友谊和团结已经成为无产阶级国际主义的榜样。通过反对日本帝国主义的长期斗争，特别是在反对美帝国主义侵略者的三年祖国解放战争时期，朝中两国人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军勇士并肩粉碎了侵略，取得了光辉的胜利。在战后恢复建设时期，兄弟的中国人民又给予了八亿元无偿援助等巨大的物质和技术援助，更加坚定了朝鲜人民建设社会主义的信心。对此，全体朝鲜人民向中国人民表示无限尊敬和感激。
    尤其是今年2月以周恩来总理为团长的中华人民共和国政府代表团的访问朝鲜，不仅加强了朝中两国人民存在已久的兄弟般的友好关系，而且是在和平解决朝鲜问题和进一步巩固、发展两国之间的合作关系方面具有巨大历史意义的事件。
    朝鲜人民今后将本着朝中两国政府联合声明所阐明的基本原则，为进一步加强朝中两国之间的友好团结而努力。
    这次为了商讨朝中两国之间长期的经济问题而访问中国的朝鲜政府代表团，亲眼看到伟大的中国共产党和人民政府领导下的智慧无穷的中国人民，在社会主义建设各个方面的大跃进中取得的光辉成就，深受感动，并像对待自己的事一样感到高兴。我们确信，不久的将来，中国人民将超过英、美资本主义的水平，成为世界上最富强的国家之一。
    朝鲜人民信心百倍地认为，这种情况将会进一步扩大和加强我们两国在政治、经济、文化及其它一切部门的合作，对于朝鲜人民跨上千里马成功地建设社会主义和朝鲜的和平统一将会产生积极的影响。
    我提议：
    为在社会主义建设中取得光辉成就的伟大的中国人民的幸福和繁荣，
    为朝中两国人民鲜血凝成的兄弟般的友谊和团结，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友好和团结，
    为伟大中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席的健康，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
