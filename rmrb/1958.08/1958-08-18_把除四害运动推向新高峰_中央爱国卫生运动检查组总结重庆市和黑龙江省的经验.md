People's Daily report: Our reporters Xu Yidao and Li Sufen report: The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team, after inspecting 83 units in seven districts of Chongqing, concluded that Chongqing has basically eliminated sparrows, rats, flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, bedbugs, and black flies – the "seven pests."

The inspection team was most satisfied that in many of Chongqing's most likely places for dirt and mosquito breeding, it was difficult to find mosquitoes and flies. The inspection team visited Dayanggou, the city's largest vegetable market. The stalls on both sides were filled with vegetables, and many foods were neatly placed in glass cabinets and covered with gauze. The inspection team inspected and nodded to the salespeople, saying, "This is truly like a vegetable exhibition hall." The inspection team stayed by several fish stalls for a long time and did not see a single fly. The inspection team visited the Xin Xin Milk Farm in Nan'an District, the Liujiatai Slaughterhouse in Jiangbei District, and the Breeding Farm in Beibei District and was impressed. At a breeding farm in Beibei District, the inspection team saw that the breeders bathed more than 1,000 pigs every day, and the pigsties were clean inside and out. Because the manure was well managed, there was no odor anywhere.

Chongqing is a mountain city with many sewers and ditches. A few months ago, sewage splashed down from cliffs dozens of meters above the Yangtze River, making sanitation work along the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers most difficult. The city's people renovated more than 30 sewer outlets, more than 310 sewage ditches, and sewage waterfalls, turning them into 16 huge aqueducts, culverts, and conduits to introduce the sewage into the river. The piles of garbage along the river were also completely removed, and trees were planted. This time, the inspection team found that the sanitation work along the riverbanks and in many residential areas with poor living conditions was very good.

The inspection team rarely saw sputum or litter on the streets of Chongqing. Many rural families in the suburbs also ensured that everyone had a face towel, a toothbrush, a spittoon, and a system of serving chopsticks.

Before liberation, Chongqing was a city with swarms of rats, flies buzzing around, and mosquitoes roaring in the morning and evening. Now, rats have disappeared throughout the city, and flies and mosquitoes are not easy to find. In the suburbs, where there used to be the most mosquitoes, many residents have now removed their mosquito nets.

After studying and analyzing the inspection situation, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team believes that the characteristics and experiences of Chongqing's elimination of the four pests and emphasis on hygiene are: (1) Balanced, universal, and in-depth development. The key to Chongqing's achievement lies in the fact that the Party organizations at all levels in the city, under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC, put politics in command, constantly pointed out the direction of combat and new tasks, adhered to the idea of eliminating the "four pests" completely, and overcame various complacent and conservative ideas in the development of the movement. Leaders at all levels also personally supervised and inspected, especially after each major assault, and were able to immediately lead the masses to engage in regular battles. Therefore, whether it is factories, government agencies, schools, or various industries, streets, or agricultural cooperatives, the work of eliminating the four pests can be done equally well. (2) The publicity work is universal and in-depth, basically known to every household and every person, indicating that the masses have been fully mobilized. At the same time, in the past, the people of Chongqing suffered the most from the "four pests," so they hated them the most, and residents deeply understood the significance and urgent need to eliminate the four pests. The whole city mobilized young and old to work together, with people sweeping everywhere and people contracting every area, with no dead corners or omissions. (3) The organization is strict, and the system is sound. From the city to the districts to the streets, leading bodies for eliminating the four pests have been established at every level; each unit has formulated covenants and systems. Every household has achieved a system of "responsibility in front of the door, contracting pieces and blocks, and contracting households to sweep clean," and streets and sections regularly supervise and inspect each other and conduct evaluations. Adult hygiene supervision posts have been established on the streets of all cities and towns. More than 50,000 hygiene activists who have emerged in the work of eliminating the four pests have played a backbone role in implementing and implementing the system. (4) After inspecting Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Chang'an Machine Factory, Xinhua Printing Factory, Chongqing Musical Instrument Factory, and Water Pump Factory, the inspection team believed that the leaders of these factories attached importance to the work and that the overall unified arrangement of production and the elimination of the four pests was well done. Therefore, the workers of these factories can adhere to working hours for production and get rid of the four pests after work. At the same time, the workshop combined safety work with "eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene" and established a "safety and hygiene handover system," proposing that "the next shift will not take over if the previous shift does not clean up." Some factories also included "eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene" as one of the evaluation conditions for advanced workshops. (5) Addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, the breeding grounds for the "seven pests" have been basically eliminated. For example, the sewer system has been renovated, and more than 500 toilets without sewers have been connected to sewers; sewage ponds have been dredged, and after the original accumulated garbage has been removed, simple garbage stations have been universally established, and spittoons and bins have been added to the streets and alleys. Some areas have also filled in various large and small water pits.

The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team believes that, based on the inspection situation in the past few days, the remnants of the "seven pests" have been found in individual areas, and the breeding grounds of the "seven pests" have not been completely eliminated. Continuous efforts are needed to fight to the end to eradicate the "seven pests." Ren Baige, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC and Mayor, on behalf of the people of Chongqing, expressed full acceptance of the inspection team's comments. He said: The people of Chongqing will never be complacent or slack off, and will thoroughly eradicate the "seven pests."

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 16th: Just as mosquitoes and flies are prone to breed in summer and autumn, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team came to Heilongjiang Province to inspect and summarize the experience of these places in eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene, so as to promote the more thorough development of the work of eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene.

The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team was divided into four groups, starting from August 1st, to conduct inspections in the streets and residents of the three cities of Harbin, Qiqihar, and Jiamusi and in the vast rural areas of seven counties including Shuangcheng, Zhaozhou, Longjiang, and Boli. Of the 309 residents in the urban and suburban areas of Harbin who were inspected, 80.9% were "four clean" households, that is, the doors, windows, walls, utensils, bedding, and furniture were clean. The inspection team saw in the Democratic Cooperative of Wujia Township, Shuangcheng County, that the members of the agricultural cooperative had basically eliminated rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, cockroaches, bedbugs and other eight pests. Some toilets in Taiji Township, Zhaozhou County, were also equipped with fly swatters and medicines, installed screens, and hung curtains. The old habit of farmers in the province defecating everywhere has been completely changed in the patriotic health campaign.

The Party and government leaders of Heilongjiang Province have worked closely and resolutely in carrying out this patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene, and have gained a lot of experience. The Longjiang County Committee of the CPC closely integrated the health campaign with production work, implemented the "five unifications" of unified leadership, unified implementation, unified inspection, unified action, and unified planning, as well as the "four combinations" of organizing and allocating forces, comprehensive mobilization, publicity and education, and visits and evaluations, and achieved good results. The inspection team learned that the county had captured more than 4 million sparrows and more than 1.2 million rats in half a year, carefully inspected and studied the situation in various aspects, and affirmed the experience of "five unifications" and "four combinations."

The in-depth inspection of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team has powerfully promoted the further development of the patriotic health campaign in Heilongjiang Province. While affirming the achievements of the various cities and counties, the inspection team also pointed out some shortcomings and called for continued efforts. At present, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team is expanding the inspection area in Heilongjiang Province.

　　把除四害运动推向新高峰
　　中央爱国卫生运动检查组总结重庆市和黑龙江省的经验
    本报讯　记者徐宜道、黎素芬报道：中央爱国卫生运动检查组最近在重庆市七个区检查八十三个单位以后得出总的印象是：重庆市已经基本上消灭了麻雀、老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、蟑螂、臭虫、墨蚊等“七害”。
    检查组最满意的是在重庆许多最容易藏污纳垢和孳生蚊蝇的场所，很难发现蚊蝇。检查组到过全市最大的蔬菜市场大阳沟。这里两旁的货摊上摆满蔬菜，许多食品都整齐地放在玻璃柜里和用纱罩盖好。检查组边检查、边向营业员点头称赞说：“这里真像蔬菜展览馆”。检查组在几个鱼摊旁停留很久，没有见到一个苍蝇。检查组到南岸区兴新乡牛奶场、江北区刘家台屠宰场、北碚区饲养场等处检查，都得到很好的印象。在北碚区一个饲养场里，检查组见到饲养员天天要给一千多头猪洗澡，猪圈的里里外外都很干净。由于粪便处理好，哪里也闻不到臭气。
    重庆是个山城，下水道口和沟渠特别多，几个月前污水还从离江几十公尺高的悬崖上往下飞溅，因此长江和嘉陵江沿岸地区卫生工作最不容易搞好。全市人民把三十多个下水道口、三百一十多条污水沟、污水瀑布进行整修，改成十六条巨大的渡槽、暗沟、道管，把污水引入江中。沿江的成堆垃圾也全部处理了，并种上了树木。这次检查组见到沿江两岸和许多居住条件较差的居民区，清洁卫生工作都很好。
    检查组在重庆的街上很少见到痰迹和乱丢果皮、纸屑的现象。市郊许多农民家庭也做到人人有面巾，个个有牙刷，家家有痰盂和建立公筷制度。
    解放前重庆市是老鼠成群，苍蝇扑面，早晚的蚊子叫声如雷。现在，全市老鼠已绝迹，苍蝇、蚊子也不容易见到了。原来蚊子最多的郊区，现在许多居民都把蚊帐取掉了。
    中央爱国卫生运动检查组对检查的情况研究分析以后，认为重庆市除四害、讲卫生工作的特点和经验是：（1）发展平衡、普遍和深入。重庆市取得这样成绩的关键在于：全市各级党组织在中共重庆市委领导下政治挂了帅，不断指出战斗方向和新的任务，坚持了除“四害”务尽的思想，战胜了运动发展中各种各样的自满保守思想。各级领导还亲自督促、检查，特别是每次大突击之后，能随即领导群众投入经常性的战斗。所以无论是工厂、机关、学校，还是各个行业、街道或农业社，除四害工作都能做得一样好。（2）宣传工作普遍深入，基本上家喻户晓、人人皆知，说明充分发动了群众。同时，过去重庆人民受“四害”的害最深，所以恨得也最深，居民们都深深地懂得除四害的意义和迫切需要。全市做到了老小一齐动手，处处有人打扫，块块有人包干，没有死角和漏户。（3）组织严密，制度健全。从市到区、到街道，层层都建立了除四害的领导机构；各单位都订立了公约和制度。各家各户都做到了“门前负责，片片块块包干和户户包干打扫清洁卫生”制度，各街道、各地段也进行经常性的相互监督和相互检查评比。全市城镇的街道都成立了成人卫生监督岗。在除四害工作中涌现出来的五万多个卫生积极分子，在执行贯彻制度方面起了骨干作用。（4）检查组检查了重庆钢铁公司、长安机器厂、新华印刷厂、重庆乐器厂和水泵厂以后，为认这些厂首先是领导重视，全面统一安排生产和除四害工作做得好。因此，这些厂的职工能坚持上班搞生产、下班除四害。同时车间把安全工作与“除四害、讲卫生”结合起来，建立了“安全卫生交接班”制度，提出“上一班搞得不清洁，下一班就不接”，有的工厂还把
  “除四害、讲卫生”列为先进车间跃进评比条件之一。（5）治标与治本双管齐下，基本消除了“七害”孳生场所。如整治了下水道系统，并使五百多个不通下水道的厕所通了下水道；疏通了污水塘，清除了原来堆积的垃圾以后，又普遍设立了简易垃圾站，大街小巷都添置了痰盂和果皮箱。有的地区还把各种大小积水坑都填补起来。
    中央爱国卫生运动检查组认为：根据几天的检查情况看，个别地区还发现了“七害”的残余，“七害”的孳生场所还没有彻底消灭，还需要再接再厉，为根绝“七害”而斗争到底。中共重庆市委书记、市长任白戈代表重庆人民，表示完全接受检查组的意见。他说：重庆市人民一定不自满、不松劲，彻底根除“七害”。
    新华社哈尔滨16日电　正当夏秋蚊蝇容易繁殖的时候，中央爱国卫生运动检查组来到黑龙江省检查和总结这些地方除四害讲卫生的经验，推动除四害讲卫生的工作更彻底开展。
    中央爱国卫生运动检查组分成四个小组，从8月1日开始，深入哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯三个城市的街道居民中和双城、肇州、龙江、勃利等七县广大农村进行检查。经过检查的哈尔滨市区和郊区三百零九户居民，有80.9％是“四净”户，就是门窗四壁干净、食具干净、寝具干净、家具干净。检查组在双城县五家乡民主社，看到农业社社员基本上消灭了老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、虱子、跳蚤、蟑螂、臭虫等八害。肇州县太吉乡有些厕所还放置了苍蝇拍和药物，安了纱窗，挂了门帘。全省农民随地便溺的旧习惯，已在爱国卫生运动中彻底改变了。
    黑龙江省党、政领导在开展全民性的除四害、讲卫生这一爱国卫生运动中，工作抓得紧，态度很坚决，取得了不少经验。中共龙江县委员会把卫生运动和生产工作紧密结合起来，实行统一领导、统一贯彻、统一检查、统一行动、统一计划等“五统”，以及组织分配力量、全面发动、宣传教育、参观评比等“四结合”，取得了很好的成绩。检查组了解到这个县在半年内捕麻雀四百多万只，捕鼠一百二十多万只，仔细检查和研究了各个方面的情况，肯定了“五统”、“四结合”的经验。
    中央爱国卫生运动检查组的深入检查，有力地推动了黑龙江省爱国卫生运动的进一步发展。检查组在给各个市、县肯定成绩的同时，也指出了一些缺点，要求继续努力。现在，中央爱国卫生运动检查组正在黑龙江省扩大检查地区。
