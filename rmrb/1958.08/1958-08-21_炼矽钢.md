　　Refining Silicon Steel
　　The silicon steel plant of Tianjin No. 15 Middle School is the most eye-catching. To ensure the production of silicon steel, more than 20 students from senior year three, senior year two, and junior year three formed a "Communist Youth League Steel Refining Shock Brigade" during the summer vacation. Braving the scorching heat, they contacted more than 60 factories in Tianjin to find raw materials and learn techniques. They started from scratch and built a local method steelmaking furnace. Lacking experience, they went to factories to learn from veteran workers. After failures and further research, they finally produced silicon steel after three days and nights of hard work. So far, they have produced 150 kilograms of silicon steel. Ye Rongxing, a second-year student and steelmaker, said, "In the past, vacations were just for fun, and all the precious time was wasted. This summer vacation has been very meaningful every day."

　　炼矽钢
    天津市十五中学的矽钢厂是最引人注目的。为了保证炼出矽钢来，高三、高二和初三的二十多名学生在暑期里成立了“共青团炼钢突击队”，冒着酷暑，和天津市的六十多个工厂联系，寻找原材料，学习技术。他们白手起家，建起了一座土法炼钢炉。他们没有经验，就到工厂去向老工人学习。失败了再研究，终于在苦战了三天三夜之后炼出了矽钢。到现在，他们已经炼出矽钢一百五十公斤。高二学生、炼钢手叶荣星说：“以往放假就是玩，大好时光都浪费了，今年暑假每天都过得非常有意义。”
