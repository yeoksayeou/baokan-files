Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 22nd (TASS): According to the "Masses Newspaper", the United States military department has printed a new Arabic "conversation" reader for American soldiers stationed in Near East countries. The "conversation" reader collects many sentences of threat, intimidation, and insults to others. For example, the newspaper cited the following phrases from the "conversation": "Where are the people in your village hiding?" "Disarm!" "Everyone get out of this room!" "Bring a shovel here to dig!" "Anyone who opposes will be shot!" "Stand up, I'm going to shoot you! You are under arrest!" "Which road leads to the armory? If you don't tell me, we'll hang you!" "All residents must leave this village within twenty-four hours," and so on.

The newspaper pointed out that the hasty printing of this "conversation" booklet for the American garrison in Lebanon is due to the Lebanese residents' hostility towards the American occupation forces.

　　学人话　发兽性
    侵黎美军的阿拉伯语会话读本
    里面尽是威胁辱骂的强盗黑话
    新华社23日讯　塔斯社大马士革22日讯：据“群众报”报道，美国军事部门为驻扎在近东国家的美国士兵印发了一种新的阿拉伯语“会话”读本。“会话”读本里收集了许多威胁、恫吓和污辱别人的句子。例如，报纸从“会话”里举出这样一些语句：“你们村里的人藏到哪儿去了？”“缴械！”“统统从这个屋子里滚出去！”“拿铲子到这里来挖土！”“谁反对就枪毙谁”“站起来，我要枪毙你！你被逮捕了！”“哪条路是往军火库去的？不说的话就把你们绞死！”“全体居民必须在二十四小时之内离开这个村子”等等。
    报纸指出，匆匆为黎巴嫩的美国驻军印发这种“会话”册子，是由于黎巴嫩居民敌视美国占领军。
