　　Adenauer's "Complaint"

　　After Adenauer's meeting with Italian Prime Minister Fanfani, he greatly complained about the US and British governments in the communiqué, chiding them for not "consulting" with him before taking intervention actions in the Middle East, truly a complaint-filled document.

　　Adenauer's "complaint" is both true and false. The false part is that Adenauer’s complaint that the US and British aggressors did not “consult” with him beforehand is not true. According to West German newspapers, as early as July 15—the day US troops invaded Lebanon—not long before then, Adenauer had already handed over Fürstenfeldbruck Airport near Munich to the United States, commanded by "battle-experienced US Air Force officers." Then, fully loaded transport planes took off and landed at the airport. On July 15, the US 24th Division was transferred from Augsburg in the north to the airport and airlifted to Adana, Turkey. At the same time, commanders at all levels of the West German army were ordered to provide all "assistance" to the US troops airlifting to the Middle East. West German Defense Minister Strauss even abandoned his vacation and rushed back to the Ministry of Defense to sign an order requiring the West German army to be on alert. Adenauer's claim that he was not "consulted" beforehand is, of course, all false.

　　Adenauer's "complaint" is also true, because even if the United States used Adenauer's airport, it was still not prepared to let West German monopoly capital share the spoils in the Middle East. Adenauer's plan fell through, so he truly "complained" about his US and British partners.

### 阿登纳的“埋怨”

    阿登纳的“埋怨”
    阿登纳和意大利总理范范尼会谈之后，在公报中大大地埋怨了美英政府一番，嗔怪他们在中东采取干涉行动前没有和他“磋商”，真可谓满纸怨气。
    阿登纳的“埋怨”有真也有假。假的是，阿登纳埋怨美英侵略者事前没有跟他“磋商”，并非事实。据西德报纸报道，早在7月15日——美军侵入黎巴嫩的那一天——以前不久，阿登纳就已经把慕尼黑近郊的福尔斯坦费尔布鲁克机场交给美国，由“富有作战经验的美国空军军官”指挥。接着，满载的运输机便在机场上升降。7月15日，美军第二十四师便从北面的奥格斯堡调到机场上来，由此空运到土耳其的亚达那。同时，西德军队的各级司令官均奉到命令，对空运中东的美军给以一切“帮助”。西德国防部长斯特劳斯还特别放弃休假，赶回国防部签署命令，要西德军队实行警戒。阿登纳说事前未同他“磋商”，当然全是假话。
    阿登纳的“埋怨”也是真的，因为，即使美国使用了阿登纳的机场，仍然不准备让西德垄断资本去中东分赃。阿登纳的这一打算落空了，于是就真的“埋怨”它的美英伙伴一番。
