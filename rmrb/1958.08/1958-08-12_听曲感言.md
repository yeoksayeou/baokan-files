Thoughts on Listening to Quyi
　　Lao She

　　Because of back pain, I couldn't sit for long periods, and I feel deeply uneasy that I couldn't watch every performance at the National Quyi Festival! However, just the programs I did see were enough to make me very excited! Some thoughts, briefly stated below:

　　First, many programs are written and performed by the actors themselves. These are all very well written. If their political awareness had not been raised, they certainly could not have written these pieces—almost all of them are praising the new people and new things in the Great Leap Forward. From their performances, I saw their political enthusiasm! This is a remarkable thing, and I must pay tribute and congratulate them!

　　Second, I saw the performances of several old actors who have long been famous. Their reputation is indeed well-deserved! Take the old man Wang Shaotang, for example. Every lift of his hand and raise of his eyebrow is closely coordinated with what he says, no more and no less, just right, making people immediately see the image as they hear his narration. There is not a single superfluous word in his mouth; a direct recording would be a good article. His movements seem to be controlled by the beat of gongs and drums; his mouth, hand, and spirit all arrive together! How much effort must this take, how rigorous the training! I sincerely hope that these old masters will take in more disciples. I also sincerely hope that all young actors will learn from the old masters, constantly improve their skills, be both red and expert, and use the best performances to promote the best ideas, serving the people.

　　Third, there are so many forms of Quyi, which surprised me! This is precisely a good opportunity for mutual observation and exchange of experience. I hope the actors will not be conservative. Absorb the strengths of others to enrich yourself. Do not use the excuse of letting a hundred flowers bloom to stubbornly adhere to what you have been taught by your teachers, only letting bloom but not creating. A hundred flowers blooming should all bloom with each passing day, with new creations. The same peony can be Yao Huang or Wei Zi; the same chrysanthemum can have a thousand different shapes and colors. Don't be afraid to create! After seeing a variety of performance methods, we should perhaps ask: Is my own singing, with only similar upper and lower phrases, a bit monotonous? Should I make some changes? Or: Is my singing of complex rhythmic patterns and overly long melodic lines making it difficult for people to understand? Or: Although my singing style is simple, can I think of ways to add more variety and make it more captivating with musical accompaniment? Or: When necessary, can I add some powerful spoken words to the singing to enhance the expressiveness? Or: Is the music or singing too high-pitched or too low, making it jarring or stuffy to listen to? ... If we ask ourselves these questions, we will truly benefit from the observation. Our tradition is precious. However, it is not appropriate to limit development and creation by placing too much emphasis on tradition. Socialist Quyi workers, like all socialist builders, must have the spirit of daring to think and act, surpassing their predecessors, and not being content with conservatism. So, how to improve? Is it just randomly piecing things together to create a Frankenstein's monster? Certainly not! Quyi originated from the people, and to improve it, we should still combine it with the masses. The people have infinite wisdom, and we will surely succeed by taking the people as our teachers.

　　I respectfully wish the national Quyi community a leap forward, a leap forward, and another leap forward!

　　听曲感言
　　老舍
    因腰痛不能久坐，对全国曲艺会演未能场场观摩，深感不安！可是，只就我所看到的那些节目来说，已足使我十分兴奋！一些感想，简述如下：
    一，不少节目是演员自编自唱的。这些都编的很不错。假若他们的政治觉悟没有提高，他们一定写不出这些段子——几乎都是歌颂大跃进中的新人新事的。从他们的表演中，使我看到他们的政治热情！这是件了不起的事，我必须向他们致敬致贺！
    二，看到几位久已闻名的老演员的表演。果然名不虚传！以王少堂老人来说吧，他的一抬手，一扬眉，都紧密地配合他口中所说的，不多不少，恰到好处，使人听到他的叙述，马上就看到了形相。他的口中没有一个废字浮词，直录下来就是好文章。他的动作好像有锣鼓点子控制着，口到手到神到！这要下多大工夫啊，经过多么严格的锻炼啊！我切盼这些位老前辈多收些徒弟。我也切盼所有的青年演员都向老人们学习，不断提高技术，作到又红又专，以最好的表演宣传最好的思想，为人民服务。
    三，曲艺形式有这么多呀，使我惊异！这也就正是互相观摩，交流经验的好机会。我希望演员们切勿保守。要吸收别人的长处，丰富自己。不要借口百花齐放，固守师传，只放不创。百花齐放要都放得日新月异，有新的创造。同是牡丹，却有姚黄魏紫；同是菊花，却态色千百。别怕创造！我们看了多种多样的表演方法之后，似乎应当问问：我自己唱的只有腔调相同的上下句，是不是单调一些呢？应该不应该加以变化呢？或是：我唱的板眼复杂，行腔太长，是不是就不易使人听得明白呢？或是：我的唱腔虽然简单，可以不可以从音乐伴奏上想想办法，多些变化，引人入胜呢？或是：在必要时，可以不可以在演唱中加些有力的话白，加强表现力呢？或是：音乐或歌唱过于高亢或过于低沉，使人听着刺耳或闷气呢？……这么一问，我们才会真得到观摩的好处。我们的传统是宝贵的。但是，因重视传统而限制住发展与创造，就不妥当了。社会主义的曲艺工作者，正如一切社会主义建设者，是必须有敢想敢干的劲头儿，超越前人，不甘保守的。那么，怎样改进呢？是不是随便拼凑，凑成四不像子呢？一定不是！曲艺原产自民间，要改进还应结合群众。人民有无穷的智慧，以人民为师，必能成功。
    敬祝全国曲艺界跃进，跃进，再跃进！
