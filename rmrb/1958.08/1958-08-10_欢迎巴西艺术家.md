    Welcome Brazilian Artists
    Zhao Feng, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association
    Chinese art workers, together with the people of our art-loving capital, warmly welcome the Brazilian Radio and Television Artists Delegation. Especially today, when American and British imperialists are invading the Middle East and seriously threatening world peace, strengthening mutual understanding among the people of the world and cultural exchange to enhance friendship among peace-loving people of all countries is even more worthy of our attention. We firmly believe that the Brazilian Radio and Television Artists Delegation's visit to China for performances will make an important contribution to strengthening the friendly relations between the Chinese and Brazilian people.
    Today, as we welcome the Brazilian artists, I cannot help but recall the warm welcome and encouragement that the Brazilian people and our Brazilian artistic colleagues extended to the Chinese artists during their visit and performances in Brazil in 1956. The days of the Chinese artists' visit to Brazil are still beautiful and pleasant memories in our lives. We clearly remember the scene where Brazilian radio and television artists held a viewing performance for Chinese artists on the roof of the Rio de Janeiro Broadcasting Hall in the Brazilian capital. The Brazilian colleagues expressed their desire to visit and perform in our country at that time. And today, Chinese artists who have visited Brazil have the opportunity to welcome Brazilian colleagues who have come all the way from the Americas via Africa and Europe in Beijing, which makes us feel particularly delighted.
    Brazilian radio and television artists performed their folk songs, dances, and music for the Chinese artists. In particular, the performance of "Samba" dance music, a representative program of Brazilian folk dance music, left a deep impression on us. The dancers' superb skills made every part of their body coincide with the complex and varied rhythms of the music. And the various instruments of the accompanying band all had a strong national flavor.
    This is the first time that Brazilian artists have visited our country. We firmly believe that their artistic activities will greatly help the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Brazilian people and the further development of cultural relations.

    欢迎巴西艺术家
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　赵沨
    中国的艺术工作者，和我们热爱艺术的首都人民一起，热烈地欢迎巴西广播、电视艺术家代表团。特别在今天，在美、英帝国主义者侵略中东，严重地威胁世界和平的目前，加强世界各族人民的相互了解，和加强各国爱好和平的人民之间的友谊的文化交流事业，更加值得我们重视。我们深信，巴西广播、电视艺术家代表团到我国的访问演出，对于加强中、巴两国人民间的友好关系，必将作出重要的贡献。
    我们今天欢迎巴西的艺术家们，不能不使我回想起，中国的艺术家们1956年在巴西作访问演出时，巴西人民和巴西的艺术同行们对我们的热情欢迎和鼓励。中国艺术家在巴西访问的演出的一些日子，至今还是我们生活中美丽和愉快回忆。我们清楚地记得，巴西的广播、电视艺术家们在巴西首都里约热内卢广播大厅的屋顶为中国艺术家们举行观摩演出的情景，至今还历历在目。巴西的同行们那时便表示想到我国来访问演出。而今天，曾经访问过巴西的中国艺术家，能够有机会在北京欢迎从美洲经过非洲、欧洲远道而来的巴西同行们，这就使我们分外感到欢愉。
    巴西的广播、电视艺术家们，曾为中国的艺术家们表演他们的民间歌舞和音乐。特别是巴西民间舞乐的代表性节目——“桑巴”舞乐的表演，曾经给我们留下深刻的印象。舞蹈者高超的技艺使身体的每个部分都吻合着音乐的复杂、变化多端的节奏。而伴奏乐队的各种乐器，都有着浓厚的民族风味。
    巴西的艺术家们是第一次访问我国，我们深信，他们的艺术活动将大大有助于中、巴两国人民的相互了解和文化关系的进一步发展。
