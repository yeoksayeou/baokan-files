When Children Get Sick, Doctors Feel the Pain
Beijing Children's Hospital Builds Miracles in Rescuing Sick Children

    This newspaper reports that Beijing Children's Hospital has done everything possible to rescue many critically ill children and has implemented a communist medical style throughout the hospital's work.

    The mortality rate for toxic dysentery in the past two years was 33%. This year, the Children's Hospital proposed cutting the mortality rate of toxic dysentery in half. The main measure is to rescue patients in a timely manner. Now, children with obvious symptoms of toxic dysentery can generally receive treatment within 15 minutes of arriving. In order to rescue children with toxic dysentery, doctors and nurses do not mind the dirt or fatigue and often stay by the patient's side. Some attending physicians did not sleep for two days and one night while rescuing patients. For comatose patients, the doctors constantly suctioned phlegm for the children, and when the suction device broke, they used their mouths through a catheter to suction. Through such rescue efforts, many critically ill children were saved from danger.

    On August 8th, at 3:45 PM, a child named Zhao Liying, suffering from toxic dysentery with a 12-hour high fever and two and a half hours of lethargy, was admitted to the hospital. The child was completely comatose, teeth clenched, face pale and gray, corneal reflex gone, and breathing irregular. There was no reaction even to injections. All the medical staff of the second-floor ward of the Children's Hospital's three clinics immediately worked together to rescue the child, administering intravenous drips, injections, medication, and oxygen, without wasting a minute. However, the child's condition was severe and getting worse. By 5:20 PM, the child's breathing had stopped (the heart was still beating). At this time, the child's parents, watching their only child about to die, were speechless. The medical staff, having improved their political awareness in the rectification movement, no longer adopted the attitude of simply preparing a death certificate when encountering a critical condition, as they had in the past. Instead, they held the belief of saving the child at all costs and continued the rescue efforts without slackening. In an extremely urgent situation, they invited doctors from the Anesthesia Department of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to participate in the rescue, and at the same time, used pressurized oxygen to help the child regain breathing. After fighting until 6:00 PM, they finally saved a child whose heart was beating erratically and whose breathing had stopped for 45 minutes. Five or six doctors and nurses continued to take turns staying by the child's side, closely observing changes in the condition and continuously injecting penicillin, adrenaline, and other drugs. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 PM, the child stopped breathing for the second time. When they used the "pressurized oxygen" method for rescue, which had never been used in pediatrics before, a large amount of bloody secretions suddenly spurted out from the child's trachea, and the heartbeat reached about 200 beats per minute. After consultation with four or five doctors, it was immediately decided to take various rescue measures. Half an hour later, the child's heartbeat finally decreased to about 160 beats per minute, breathing was restored, and the condition improved again. At about 1:00 AM the next morning, the child stopped breathing for the third time, and a large amount of bloody secretions spurted out from the mouth, life was in danger. Under these circumstances, the medical staff put forward the slogan "Only save the child!" and continued to think of all possible ways to rescue, and the child finally turned from danger to safety. Eight days later, the child, who had stopped breathing three times, finally recovered and was discharged from the hospital.

    Wang Zhenfu, a newborn only six days old, suffered from tetanus, complicated by pneumonia, sepsis, and subcutaneous cellulitis. When he arrived at the hospital clinic, he was already convulsing non-stop, and the situation was critical. If he were not admitted to the ward for rescue, he might soon die in the clinic. The medical staff decided to rescue the child. The single dark rooms in the ward were already full of sick children, so they made an exception and placed the child in a large ward. The medical staff and technicians worked together to install a black cover over the bed and moved the crying children in the same room to the nurses' office, creating the two necessary conditions of darkness and quiet for the tetanus patient. In order to avoid causing excessive convulsions due to injection stimulation, the doctors inserted a gastric tube from the side seam of the clenched jaw, and medicine and milk were poured in through the gastric tube. The nursing staff diligently cared for this feverish, comatose infant under the black cover, turning him over and changing diapers in a timely manner. In the scorching July heat, the child did not develop any prickly heat, and his buttocks were not red. Thanks to the meticulous care of the medical staff, the child's convulsions completely stopped after two weeks in the hospital. The child's mother was a rural woman who had given birth to nine children, and several of her children had died from tetanus in the past. However, this time, she was overjoyed to take home this child with bright black eyes from the hospital after two weeks.

    This is the fruitful result of the rectification movement in the Children's Hospital. In the raging fire of the rectification movement, the medical staff seriously examined and criticized their bourgeois individualism. In the process of rectification and reform, the hospital broke some old rules and regulations that were unfavorable to patients, abolished the emergency regulations, and allowed consultations at any time, regardless of the severity of the illness. The clinics were open as usual on Sundays and holidays, providing consultations 365 days and nights a year. Sick children who needed hospitalization were admitted as much as possible, and the scope of parental accompaniment was expanded. In order to avoid the disadvantages of the eight-hour shift system for resident physicians for the treatment of patients, the system of continuous responsibility for resident physicians was fully implemented.

### 娃娃生了病　医生疼在心  北京儿童医院抢救病儿建奇功

　　娃娃生了病　医生疼在心
    北京儿童医院抢救病儿建奇功
    本报讯　北京儿童医院千方百计地抢救了许多垂危的病儿，而且把共产主义的医疗作风贯彻到医院的整个工作中。
    中毒性痢疾前两年的病死率是33％。今年儿童医院提出要砍掉中毒性痢疾病死率的一半，主要的措施就是及时抢救。现在，凡是症状明显的中毒性痢疾病儿，一般的能在进门后十五分钟内作上治疗。为了抢救中毒性痢疾患儿，大夫、护士不嫌脏，不嫌累，经常守在病人身旁。有的主治医师在抢救病人时两夜一天没有睡觉，对于这种昏迷的病人，大夫们不断地为孩子吸痰，当吸痰器坏了的时候，就用自己的口通过导管来吸。经过这样的抢救，很多垂危的孩子脱离了危险。
    在8月8日下午三点四十五分，患中毒性痢疾的儿童赵立英因高烧十二小时、嗜睡两个半小时而来住院了。这个孩子当时完全昏迷，牙关紧闭，面色青灰，眼底角膜反射已消失，呼吸不规则，连打针都没有反应了。儿童医院三条门诊部二楼病房全体医护人员当即一起抢救，作静脉点滴、注射、喂药、给氧气，一分钟也没有耽误。但孩子病势沉重，情况愈来愈坏，到五点二十分病儿的呼吸已停止了
  （心还跳动）。这时，病儿的父母看着将要死去的自己唯一的孩子，呆的说不出话来。在整风运动中提高了政治觉悟的医护人员们，再也不像过去一遇到垂危病状就只好准备死亡诊断书的态度，而是抱着一心把病儿救活的信念，丝毫不懈地继续抢救。在极其紧急的情况下，他们请了中国医学科学院麻醉科大夫参加抢救，同时采用加压力输氧气的办法使病儿恢复呼吸。这样战斗到六点多钟，终于把一个心跳很乱、呼吸停止了四十五分钟的孩子救活过来。五、六个大夫和护士仍然轮流守在孩子身旁，密切观察病情的变化，不断地注射青霉素、肾上腺激素等药物。不想到八点多钟，病儿又第二次停止呼吸。当她们采用儿科从未使用过的“加压用氧”的办法进行抢救时，大量血性分泌物突然从病儿气管中喷出来，心跳每分钟达到二百次左右。在四、五位大夫会诊下，立即决定采取各种办法抢救。半小时后，这个孩子的心跳才每分钟减到一百六十次左右，恢复了呼吸，病情又好转了。到了第二天早晨一点钟左右，病儿第三次停止呼吸，又有大量的血性分泌物从嘴内喷出，生命垂危。在这种情况下，医护人员们提出“只能救活”的口号，继续想尽一切办法抢救，孩子终于转危为安。八天后，这个三次停止呼吸的病儿终于痊愈出院了。
    刚出生六天的病儿王真福患破伤风，合并肺炎、败血症、皮下蜂窝组织炎，到医院门诊时已抽风不止，情况危急，如果不收入病房抢救，可能很快死在门诊室里。医护人员决心要抢救这个孩子。病房的单间黑屋子都已收满了病孩，他们就破格地把孩子放在大病房。医护人员和技工一起安装了一个黑罩子，罩在病床上，把同屋哭闹的病孩移到护士办公的地方，为破伤风病儿创造了黑暗和安静这两个必不可少的条件。大夫们为了不使孩子因注射刺激而引起过多的抽风，就把胃管从紧闭着的牙床侧缝里插了进去，药水和奶都从胃管灌进去。护理人员在黑罩子底下辛勤地护理着这个高烧、昏迷的婴儿，及时给他翻身、换尿布。在酷热的7月里，这个病儿没生一点痱子，屁股也没有腌红。由于医护人员的细心护理，孩子住院两周后抽风完全停止，孩子的妈妈是一个已生过九个孩子的农村妇女，过去有几个孩子都由于患破伤风死亡，但是这次，她却在两周之后，喜出望外地从医院里抱回了这个两眼黑溜溜的孩子。
    这是整风运动在儿童医院结成的丰硕之果。医护人员们在整风运动的烈火中，认真检查和批判了自己的资产阶级个人主义思想。医院在边整边改中，破除了一些不利于病人的陈规陋习，取消了急诊条例，不论患病轻重，任何时候都可就诊，星期日和假日照常门诊，作到一年三百六十五天日夜应诊。需要住院的病儿尽可能住院，并扩大了家长陪住的范围。为了避免住院医师八小时换班制不利于病人的治疗，全面实行了住院医师一贯负责制。
