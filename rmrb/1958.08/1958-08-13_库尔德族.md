　　The Kurdish People
    In the struggle of the Iraqi people against the military threats of the United States and Britain, strengthening internal unity, including the close unity between the Arab and Kurdish peoples, is an important guarantee for achieving victory.
    The Provisional Constitution of the Republic of Iraq stipulates that Arabs and Kurds are citizens of the Republic of Iraq, and all citizens are equal before the law; it also stipulates the protection of the rights of all ethnic groups in the country. The Provisional Constitution for the first time does not treat the Kurds as a minority, but allows them to enjoy equal treatment as partners with the Arabs. Nakshabandi, a member of the Supreme Power Council of the Republic, is a Kurd.
    The government of the Republic of Iraq also announced the abolition of the so-called "tribal litigation procedures" implemented by past reactionary regimes. This "procedure" came into effect in 1921 and allowed local officials to use "administrative reasons, security and stability" as an excuse to expel any member of a tribe, or even an entire tribe, from their hometowns. Reactionary governments had abused this "procedure" to persecute all ethnic groups, especially the Kurds. Therefore, the abolition of this "procedure" has consolidated the equal status of all ethnic groups in Iraq.
    The Kurds live in northern Iraq and account for one-sixth of the total population of Iraq. For a long time, British imperialism and the Iraqi reactionary government implemented a policy of national division, inciting relations between Arabs and Kurds, and carrying out cruel exploitation and ruthless massacres of the Kurds. However, the Kurds have always carried out national liberation movements together with the Arabs. The Kurds held a large-scale uprising in 1945. After World War II, the Kurdish national liberation movement, under the leadership of the Kurdish Democratic Party, became an important force in the Iraqi national liberation movement.
    After the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, the Kurds declared their full support for the Iraqi revolution. Now, Kurdish chief Latif has also stated: "My nation places all its hopes on the future of the Republic of Iraq." The unity of the Iraqi people is a heavy blow to the imperialist conspiracy of aggression. (Zhen)

　　库尔德族
    伊拉克人民在反对美英武力威胁的斗争中，加强内部的团结，包括阿拉伯族和库尔德族之间的紧密团结，是取得胜利的重要保证。
    伊拉克共和国临时宪法规定，阿拉伯人和库尔德人都是伊拉克共和国的公民，一切公民在法律面前一律平等；同时还规定保障国内各民族的权利。临时宪法使库尔德人第一次不是被当作少数民族看待，而是享受到作为阿拉伯人的平等伙伴的待遇。共和国最高权力委员会委员纳克沙班迪就是库尔德族人。
    伊拉克共和国政府还宣布废除过去反动政权实施的所谓“部族诉讼程序”。这项“程序”是1921年开始生效的，它使地方官员可以用
  “行政理由、安全和稳定”为借口，把部族的任何一个人甚至是整个部族驱逐出他们的家乡。反动政府曾经滥用这项“程序”来迫害各民族，特别是库尔德族人。因此，这个“程序”的废除，巩固了伊拉克各民族的平等地位。
    库尔德族居住在伊拉克北部，占伊拉克总人口的六分之一。长期来英帝国主义和伊拉克反动政府执行民族分裂政策，挑拨阿拉伯人同库尔德人的关系，对库尔德人实行残酷的剥削和无情的屠杀。但库尔德人始终同阿拉伯人一起进行民族解放运动。库尔德族曾在1945年举行了大规模的起义。第二次世界大战后，库尔德族民族解放运动在库尔德民主党领导下，成为伊拉克民族解放运动中的一支重要力量。
    伊拉克共和国成立后，库尔德族宣布完全支持伊拉克的革命。现在库尔德族长拉蒂夫又表示：“我的民族把一切希望寄于伊拉克共和国的前途。”伊拉克人民的团结，是对帝国主义侵略阴谋的沉重打击。（真）
