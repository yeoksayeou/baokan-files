　　Xinhua News Agency, August 30th dispatch from Washington: In the past week, the United States government has continuously issued shameless menacing cries regarding the Taiwan Strait situation, rudely interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese people, and妄想attempting to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory.

　　On August 23rd, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles claimed that if the Chinese people were to exercise their sacred right—to liberate their own territory, Jinmen and Mazu—he would “fear that this might constitute a threat to the peace of this area.” Dulles supported the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the running dog fostered by the United States, and threatened the Chinese people, saying: "These islands have always been in the hands of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique)," and "Anyone who imagines that the Chinese Communists attempt to change this situation by force and now attack and attempt to conquer these islands might be a limited military operation is extremely dangerous." Dulles's words were spoken in a reply to an inquiry from Representative Morgan, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

　　U.S. President Eisenhower also made a statement at a press conference on August 27th, reiterating the U.S. government's position as an aggressor occupying China's sacred territory of Taiwan, and declaring that the United States would not abandon the "responsibility" it had already undertaken to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan by force. When asked whether the United States would carry out armed intervention when the Chinese people liberated their own territory, Jinmen and Mazu, he said that the "most appropriate thing" he could say at present was something like what Dulles said above. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had deployed approximately one-third of its troops on Jinmen, Mazu, and other islands, which made the "interrelationship" between these islands and Taiwan "closer than before," and this "may affect" the United States' decision. But he also said that there were many other factors to consider, and "it is impossible to make a military decision until the matter is at hand."

　　The day after Eisenhower made his statement, the U.S. State Department issued a special statement on the 28th, repeating Dulles's words of the 23rd and shamelessly smearing the Chinese people's just action of shelling the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the islands of Jinmen and Mazu as "aggressive expansionism."

　　On the 29th, U.S. Army Secretary Bruck also joined Dulles, Eisenhower, and the U.S. State Department in their clamoring. He used typical American rogue rhetoric in a press conference held in Seoul, South Korea, to threaten that if the Chinese people "underestimated or misunderstood the statements of President Eisenhower or Secretary of State Dulles," they "will regret it."

### 美国粗暴地干涉我国内政  连续就台湾海峡局势发出恫吓性叫嚣

　　美国粗暴地干涉我国内政
    连续就台湾海峡局势发出恫吓性叫嚣
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：最近一周来，美国政府就台湾海峡局势连续发出无耻的恫吓性叫嚣，粗暴地干涉中国人民的内政，妄想阻止中国人民解放自己的领土。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯8月23日声称，如果中国人民要行使自己的神圣权利——解放自己的领土金门和马祖，他就“担心这可能构成对这个地区的和平的威胁”。杜勒斯为美国所豢养的走狗蒋介石集团撑腰并且威胁中国人民说：“这些岛屿始终在中华民国（指蒋介石集团）手中”，“任何人要是设想，中国共产党人企图用武力改变这种情况并在现在进攻和企图征服这些岛屿可能是一种有限的军事行动，那是十分危险的”。杜勒斯的这些话是在他回答众议院外交委员会主席摩根询问的复信里说的。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔8月27日也在记者招待会上发表谈话，重申美国政府霸占中国神圣的领土——台湾的侵略者立场，声明美国将不放弃它已经承担的关于以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾的“责任”。在回答关于在中国人民解放自己的领土金门、马祖时美国是否要进行武装干涉的问题时，他说，他目前所能说的“最妥当的话”就是杜勒斯上述声明中所说的那类东西。他说，蒋介石集团已经在金门、马祖等各岛部署了大约三分之一的军队，这就使这些岛屿同台湾之间的“相互关联比以前更加密切了”，这一点“可能影响”美国的决定。但是他又说，还有许多其他因素要考虑，“不到事情临头以后，是根本无法作出军事上的决定的”。
    在艾森豪威尔发表谈话的第二天，美国国务院又在28日专门发表了声明，把杜勒斯23日的话复述了一遍，并且无耻地诬蔑中国人民炮轰盘踞在金门、马祖各岛的蒋介石军队的正义行动是“侵略性的扩张主义”。
    29日，美国陆军部长布鲁克也加入了杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔和美国国务院的叫嚣，他在南朝鲜汉城举行的记者招待会上用典型的美国流氓腔调进行恫吓说，如果中国人民“低估或误解了艾森豪威尔总统或国务卿杜勒斯的声明”，他们“将要因此而后悔”。
