Chongqing and Xi'an Rapidly and Economically Develop the Machine Industry
Using Cement to Make Machine Tool Main Components

    This newspaper, Chongqing, 12th - The major initiative of Chongqing's mechanical industry in using cement and wood to replace steel in manufacturing machine tools and other equipment main components has opened up new avenues for the mechanical industry to rapidly solve equipment and material difficulties and accelerate development. Currently, nearly a hundred large, medium, and small-sized machinery factories and steel mills' repair workshops in the city are promoting the experience of using cement to manufacture machine tool main components.
    In mid-July, employees of the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory first successfully manufactured a large gantry planer with a cement base and arch. In the past twenty days, Chang'an Machinery Factory, Wangjiang Machinery Factory, Chongqing Machine Tool Factory, and others have produced new types of large machine tools. They all use cement for the base, arches, and other main components that require the most steel, and use a small amount of steel for other parts. These machine tools include gantry planers, vertical lathes, shapers, boring machines, thread rolling machines, and various other types. Chang'an Machinery Factory produced thirteen such machine tools in ten days. These factories' experiences prove that as long as the machine tool has minimal vibration and is in a fixed position, the base, arch, and other fixed parts that require the most steel and take the longest to manufacture can be made of cement. Currently, factories are further researching the use of wood, stone, and other materials to manufacture machines. Wangjiang Machinery Factory, Chang'an Machinery Factory, and others have already made cranes out of wood.
    Machines manufactured entirely of steel require sand casting for their main components and steel casting equipment. Many parts also require machining, so manufacturing takes a long time. Using cement and wood to manufacture machine main components eliminates the need for sand casting and is not restricted by steel casting equipment. Many machine tool parts also do not require machining, which greatly accelerates the manufacturing speed of the mechanical industry, allowing for the timely production of many heavy machines to equip themselves. The main components of large gantry planers, which are currently urgently needed by various machinery factories, typically take as long as one hundred and five days from cast iron and machining to assembly; now, using reinforced concrete pouring, it generally only takes about seven days. Because Wangjiang Machinery Factory quickly manufactured large machine tools, cranes, and other equipment using cement and wood, the factory can well undertake the task of producing rolling mills for rolling millions of tons of steel this second half of the year. Using cement, wood, and other materials to manufacture machinery and equipment also solves the difficulty of lacking steel in the self-made equipment of various machinery factories. Chang'an Machinery Factory saved one hundred tons of steel by making the bases of six circular lathes out of cement. Each four-meter gantry planer made by various factories using cement as main components can save six tons of steel, and the cost is also reduced by 62%.

    This newspaper, Xi'an, 12th - Reporter Li Qian reports: Recently, a novel giant machine stands in the repair workshop of the state-owned Dongfang Machinery Factory in Xi'an. Its base and pillars are made of cement, and the bed is not painted. Compared to some modern equipment in the workshop, it looks a bit rustic, but its production efficiency is much greater than the small and medium-sized planers in the workshop and is no less than that of the same large foreign machine tools.
    This six-meter giant machine tool was produced by the employees of the Dongfang Machinery Factory in twenty days, saving about 150,000 yuan compared to purchasing the same large gantry planer, and saving more than twenty tons of steel compared to manufacturing a steel gantry planer. This factory also plans to produce three to five types of large gantry planer rolling mills, vertical lathes, gantry milling machines, etc., with cement bases and pillars.
    Currently, employees of the state-owned Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory, Qinchuan Machinery Factory, and Huashan Machinery Factory are also actively using indigenous methods to produce various heavy-duty machines with cement bases and pillars, and some have already been successfully manufactured. For example, Qinchuan Machinery Factory has manufactured a vertical lathe with a cement base with a diameter of 2.5 meters, which our country cannot currently produce. The production of this lathe only used more than two tons of steel and an investment of more than 8,000 yuan. It can process parts weighing seven or eight tons. With this machine tool, the key problem of producing power generation equipment in the factory can be solved.
    In the few years since liberation, more than a dozen large machinery factories have been newly built in the Xi'an area, and there is a lot of mechanical equipment, but they are all small and medium-sized machine tools and cannot produce large products. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the Xi'an area is undertaking the task of manufacturing most of the metallurgical, mechanical, and electrical equipment urgently needed for the development of the metallurgical industry in the Northwest region. Manufacturing this equipment requires heavy machinery. Purchasing these heavy machinery requires a large investment, and many of these equipment are in short supply domestically, and some even need to be imported. In order to build Xi'an into a complete mechanical industry system in a faster, better, and more economical way, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has conducted many studies. It was decided to rely on the wisdom of the employees to produce large equipment using indigenous methods.
    The success of producing large equipment using indigenous methods has greatly strengthened the confidence and courage of employees in relying on their own strength to build Xi'an into a complete mechanical industry system. Now, some factories are actively preparing or starting to produce larger machinery, such as twelve-meter gantry planers, seven-meter vertical lathes, large gantry planers, etc. After all these large equipment are manufactured, they can produce the urgently needed rolling steel, metallurgy, power generation, lathe, and other large equipment. 80% of the equipment needed for the development of the metallurgical industry in Shaanxi and the Northwest can be manufactured.

　　重庆西安又快又省地发展机械工业
　　用水泥制机床主件
    本报重庆12日电　重庆市机械工业用水泥、木材代替钢铁制造工作母机和其他设备的主件的重大创举，为机械工业迅速解决设备、材料困难、加快发展速度开辟了新的途径。目前，全市有近百个大中小型机械厂和钢铁厂的机修车间，正在推广用水泥制造机床主件的经验。
    重庆空气压缩机厂职工在7月中旬，首先制造成功了用水泥做机座和牌坊的大龙门刨床。近二十天来，长安机器厂、望江机器厂、重庆机床厂等，都制成了新型的大型机床。它们都是用水泥做机座、牌坊等需要钢铁最多的主件，用少量钢铁做其他零部件。这些机床包括龙门刨床、落地车床、插床、搪床、滚丝机等各种类型。长安机器厂在十天内就制出了十三部这样的机床。这些厂的事实证明：只要是震动不大、位置固定的机床，它的需要钢铁最多、花制造时间最长的机座、牌坊等固定部分，都可以用水泥制造。目前，各厂正在进一步研究利用木料、石头等制造机器。望江机器厂、长安机器厂等都已经用木料制成了行车。
    全部用钢铁制造的机器，它的主件需要翻砂，需要有浇注钢铁设备，许多部件还要进行机械加工，因此制造起来花的时间长。用水泥、木料制造机器的主件，既不用翻砂，又不受浇注钢铁设备的限制，机床的许多部件也不需要加工，这就使机械工业大大加快了制造速度，可以及时制造出许多重型机器来装备自己。各机械厂目前急需的大龙门刨床的主件，按照一般情况，由铸铁、机械加工到装配，周期长达一百零五天；现在用钢筋水泥浇灌，一般七天左右就可以制成。望江机器厂由于用水泥、木料很快制成大型机床、行车等设备，全厂今年下半年生产轧制上百万吨钢材的轧钢机的任务已能很好地担负起来。用水泥、木料等制造机器设备，也解决了各机械厂在自制设备中缺乏钢铁的困难。长安机器厂用水泥制成六部圆车的机座，就节约了一百吨钢铁。各厂用水泥做主件制造四公尺龙门刨床，每部可节约六吨钢铁，成本也降低62％。
    本报西安12日电　记者李茜报道：最近，西安国营东方机械厂的机修车间里，矗立着一台新奇的巨型机器。它的基座和支柱都是用水泥作的，床身上没有涂油漆，比起车间里一些现代的设备有点土气，但是，它的生产效率却比车间里的那些中小型的刨床大得多，也不低于同样大的洋机床。
    这部六公尺的巨型机床，是东方机械厂的职工在二十天内生产出来的，比购买同样大的龙门刨可节约十五万元左右，比制造一台钢铁的龙门刨节约二十多吨钢铁。这个厂还计划生产三种至五种水泥基座和支柱的大型龙门刨轧滚机、立式车床、龙门铣等。
    现在，国营西安机器制造厂、秦川和华山等机械厂的职工，也都积极用土办法生产各种水泥基座和支柱的重型机械，有的已经制造成功了。如秦川机械厂制成一台水泥基座的直径二点五公尺的立式车床，这种车床是目前我国还不能生产的。生产这台车床只用了两吨多钢材，八千多元投资。它可以加工七、八吨重的零件。有了这台机床，就可以解决该厂生产发电设备的关键问题。
    西安地区在解放几年来新建设了十几个大型机械工厂，机械设备很多，但都是中小型机床，不能生产大型产品。第二个五年计划期间，西安地区承担着西北地区发展冶金工业急需大部分冶金、机械、电业设备的制造任务。制造这些设备要有重型机械，购买这些重型机械，需要大量投资，而且其中很多设备在国内供应十分紧张，有的还需要进口。为了多快好省地把西安建设成一套完整的机械工业体系，中共西安市委曾进行了多次研究。决定依靠职工群众的智慧，用土法生产大设备。
    用土办法生产大型设备成功，大大加强了职工依靠自己的力量把西安建成一套完整的机械工业体系的信心和勇气。现在，有些工厂已经积极准备或开始生产更大型的机械。如十二公尺龙门刨，七公尺立式车床，大型龙门刨等。这些大型设备全部制成后，就可以生产目前急需的轧钢、冶金、发电、车床等大型设备。陕西和西北发展冶金工业所需要的设备，80％都可以制造了。
