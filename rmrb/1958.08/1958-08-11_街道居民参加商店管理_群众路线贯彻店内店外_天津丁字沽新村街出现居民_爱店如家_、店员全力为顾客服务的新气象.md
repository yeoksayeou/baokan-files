Street Residents Participate in Store Management
Mass Line Implemented Inside and Outside the Store
New Atmosphere in Tianjin Dingzigu New Village Street with Residents "Loving the Store Like Home" and Staff Serving Customers Wholeheartedly

　　(Reported by our newspaper) Tianjin Dingzigu New Village Street has mobilized residents to participate in store management, providing valuable experience for retail stores to more thoroughly and completely follow the mass line and operate socialist commerce effectively.

　　Recently, Dingzigu New Village Street established a store management committee with the participation of residents, street cadres, store leaders, and employees, to manage all twenty-six stores in the street, including grain, coal, department stores, pastry, catering, welfare, and non-staple food stores. The charter of the management committee stipulates that it has three aspects of management power: First, in terms of business management: the management committee can jointly study and determine with the stores the adjustment of business hours, the distribution of commercial networks, the increase or decrease of varieties, the improvement of hygiene, and the rational allocation of planned supply commodities, temporary insufficient commodities, and major commodities supplied during festivals. Second, in terms of personnel management and education: the management committee has the power to criticize and educate the service quality and work style of store employees and suggest that relevant parties impose penalties. Third, in terms of financial management: the management committee has the right to check the use of funds and expenditure of the stores. The store management committee also stipulated five obligations: to regularly publicize commercial policies to residents, educate residents to abide by sales order, cherish commodities, value the labor of store employees, and establish the idea of "loving the store like home," etc.

　　The resident members of this store management committee are democratically elected. The director of the committee is concurrently held by the director of the street office.

　　In order to avoid forming a generalized consulting organization, the resident members of this store management committee participate in the management work of the stores in a more concrete way. The committee has five management groups, dividing all the stores in the street into five areas, with the members taking charge of liaison and conducting regular inspections and guidance. At the same time, each store reports its work to the management committee regularly.

　　After residents participated in store management, a democratic management system was formed from the inside to the outside of socialist commerce. The enthusiasm of store leaders, employees, and residents has been fully mobilized, and the relationship between socialist commerce and the people has undergone profound changes. Residents are both customers and masters, truly regarding the store as their own. The communist idea of "loving the store like home" has been further established. Even during the preparation of this store management committee, one day, the grain store received more than 5,000 jin of rice, and it happened to be raining. There were few salespeople and the business was busy, so they could not quickly move the rice into the store. Seeing the danger of the rice being rained on, nearby residents immediately took the initiative to come and help, and it only took five or six minutes to move the rice into the store. Recently, some residents still flipped through bundles of vegetables when buying vegetables and lifted the lids when buying crabs, picking and choosing randomly, causing damage to the commodities. Gao Rufen, a representative of the management group, saw this and immediately dissuaded these consumers, saying: "The store belongs to all of us, and any loss is your loss and mine!" Residents often offer opinions on the shortcomings of the store with a sense of ownership.

　　After residents participated in store management, the store employees humbly accepted the residents' opinions and worked harder to serve the people wholeheartedly. The comprehensive canteen in this new village used to sell more expensive dishes, generally three or four jiao per serving. After residents offered their opinions, more than twenty kinds of side dishes costing a few fen or a jiao were immediately added. The more expensive stir-fried dishes can also be sold in half portions. A fish salesperson named Ding and a grain salesperson named Qi in the non-staple food store used to have a bad service attitude towards customers. Customers called them "Official Ding Fish" and "Official Qi Grain." Recently, their service attitude has greatly changed, treating residents like family members. An old lady said with emotion: "The saying 'It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature' is wrong. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, everyone can be transformed."

　　The Finance and Trade Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that mobilizing residents to participate in store management is a revolutionary measure and a completely new thing. It is not only economic work but also political work. This requires leaders to personally take action, arouse the attention of the whole party, and deeply solve the ideological problems existing among residents and store employees. At the beginning, some residents thought: "The store has been rectified very well, and we are very satisfied. What else can we manage!" Some residents were also afraid that they "couldn't manage it"; some store employees were worried that there would be "too many mothers-in-law" after residents participated in management, making the work more difficult. After the Party's in-depth education and enlightenment to open up their minds, residents not only actively requested to participate in the management of their own stores, but also put forward specific management methods. The powers and obligations stipulated in the charter of this management committee were proposed by the residents. On the employee side, after factual education, they not only realized that it was not a question of "too many mothers-in-law" at all, but also realized that mobilizing residents to participate in management was a huge force for promoting the progress of commercial work.

　　街道居民参加商店管理
　  群众路线贯彻店内店外
　　天津丁字沽新村街出现居民“爱店如家”、店员全力为顾客服务的新气象
    本报讯　天津丁字沽新村街发动居民参加商店管理，为零售商店更彻底更完整地走群众路线，办好社会主义商业，提供了值得注意的经验。
    最近，丁字沽新村街成立了有居民、街道干部、商店领导和职工参加的商店管理委员会，全民管理全街的粮、煤、百货、糕点、饮食、福利、副食品等二十六个商店。管理委员会的章程规定，它有三方面的管理权力：一、经营管理方面：管理委员会可以和商店共同研究确定有关营业时间的调整、商业网的分布、花色品种的增减、清洁卫生的改善以及计划供应商品、临时供应不足商品、节日供应主要商品的合理分配等。二、人事管理和教育方面：管理委员会对商店从业人员的服务质量和工作作风，有批评教育和建议有关方面进行处分的权力。三、财务管理方面：管理委员会有权检查商店的资金使用、费用开支等情况。商店管理委员会还规定了五项义务：经常向居民宣传商业政策，教育居民遵守售货秩序、爱护商品、珍惜店员的劳动，树立
  “爱店如家”的思想等。
    这个商店管理委员会中的居民委员是由民主推选产生的。委员会的主任由街办事处主任兼任。
    为了避免形成一般化的咨询机构，这个商店管理委员会中的居民委员都比较具体地参加商店的管理工作。委员会下设五个管理小组，将全街商店分成五片，由委员们分工负责联系，并经常进行检查和指导。同时，各商店定期向管理委员会汇报工作。
    居民参加商店管理以后，社会主义商业从内部到外部的民主管理制度都形成了。商店领导干部、店员、居民的积极性全面高涨，社会主义商业和人民群众之间的关系起了深刻的变化。居民既是顾客、又是主人，把商店真正看作是自己的了。“爱店如家”的共产主义思想进一步树立起来。还在这个商店管理委员会的筹备过程中，有一天，粮店运到了五千多斤大米，正碰上下雨，售货员少，业务又忙，不能很快地把米搬到屋里，眼看有被雨淋的危险，附近居民立刻主动地赶来帮忙，只用了五、六分钟，就把大米搬到屋里，最近，有个别居民还像过去那样买菜时翻捆、买螃蟹掀盖，乱挑乱选，造成商品的损失，管理小组的代表高汝芬老大娘见到后，马上就劝阻这些消费者说：“商店是咱们大家的，损失了有你一份也有我一份啊！”居民群众对商店存在的某些缺点，也经常以主人翁的态度提出意见。
    店员们在居民参加商店管理以后，虚心接受居民意见，全心全意为人民服务的干劲更足了。这个新村里的综合食堂，过去卖的菜肴较贵，一般是三、四角钱一份，居民提出意见后，立即增添了二十多种几分钱或一角多钱一份的小菜，较贵的炒菜还可以出售半份。副食品商店里一个姓丁的卖鱼售货员和粮店里一个姓齐的售货员，过去对顾客服务态度不好，顾客称他们为
  “丁鱼官”和“齐粮官”，最近服务态度大为改变，对居民亲如家人。一个老大娘感动地说：“江山易改，秉性难移”这句话不对了，在共产党领导下，人人都可以改造。
    中共天津市委财贸部认为：发动居民参加商店管理，是一项革命措施，又是完全新的事情。它不仅是经济工作，而且是政治工作。这就需要领导亲自动手，引起全党重视，深入解决居民和店员存在的思想问题。开始时有些居民认为：“商店整改得已经很好了，我们很满意，还有什么可管的呢！”也有些居民怕“管不了”；有的店员则顾虑居民参加管理以后“婆婆多”，工作更不好作。经过党的深入教育启发，打通思想，居民们不但积极要求参加自己的商店管理，而且纷纷提出具体的管理办法。这个管理委员会章程中规定的权力和义务，就是由居民群众提出来的。在店员方面，经过事实教育，不仅认识到根本不是什么“婆婆多”的问题，而是体会到发动居民参加商店管理是推动商业工作前进的巨大力量。（附图片）
