Advocate This Kind of Competition
    Wen Ying

    In March and April of this year, this newspaper continuously reported that the workers of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, through diligent study and bold innovation, surpassed Shanghai, which had always been the leader in the enamel industry, in product quality and jumped to the first place in the country. Afterwards, Shanghai's enamel industry quickly caught up and overtook Xi'an. Recently, the Xi'an Enamel Factory has had another great leap forward, and the quality of its products has surpassed Shanghai again.

    This situation reflects the vigorous and dynamic situation in China's Great Leap Forward.

    We know that in socialist society, the difference between the advanced and the backward is universal, and at the same time, this difference is constantly transforming. The backward catch up with the advanced and leave the advanced behind. The originally advanced ones then summon up their energy and catch up again. This is a normal phenomenon in socialist society. Because our social production is based on ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, there is no contradiction of private interests between this enterprise and that enterprise, and everyone is striving for the benefit of the whole society. Therefore, it is beneficial to the development of social productive forces and to all the people for A to surpass B, and then B to surpass A again.

    However, some people have an incorrect concept. They are not very willing to see others run ahead of them, and even regard the progress of others as a detrimental factor to themselves and their units. This kind of thinking is essentially a reflection of "championship-ism" under the capitalist system, which is completely different from the revolutionary competition under the socialist system.

    Our opposition to championship-ism does not mean that competition between each other is not needed in socialist society. On the contrary, we fully advocate carrying out revolutionary competition, which is a very good way to promote the development of social production. What are the fundamental principles of socialist competition? In summary, it is "learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths, and improve together." That is to say, advanced production units should not only strive to improve production and maintain their own advancement, but also strive to promote others to advance from backwardness. Advanced units lead backward units, constantly helping backward units to fight to eliminate backwardness. It is necessary to eliminate the unhealthy mentality of being afraid of being surpassed by others, and instead, congratulate others on their progress, and then strive to catch up, and constantly promote the development of productive forces.

    Wave after wave, surpassing, and surpassing again, making China's socialist construction leap forward again and again, this is a guiding principle that should be advocated. The Xi'an Enamel Factory has already made very good achievements, and we hope to continue to receive such good news!

    提倡这种竞赛
    文英
    今年3、4月里，本报曾经连续报道过：西安人民搪瓷厂的工人们，由于勤学苦钻、大胆独创，产品质量超过历来执搪瓷业牛耳的上海而跃居全国第一位。以后，上海搪瓷工业急起直追，又赶上了西安。最近，西安搪瓷厂又来了一个大跃进，产品质量又赶到上海的前头。
    这种情况反映了我国大跃进中蓬蓬勃勃的生动形势。
    我们知道，在社会主义社会里，先进和落后的差别是普遍存在的，同时，这种差别也在不断转化。落后的赶上了先进的，把先进的抛在后面。原来先进的又鼓足干劲，再度赶上前去。这是社会主义社会的一种正常现象。因为我们的社会生产是全民所有制和集体所有制，这个企业和那个企业之间没有什么私人利害的矛盾，大家都是为了全社会的利益而奋斗。因此甲超过乙，乙再超过甲都是有利于社会生产力的发展，有利于全体人民的。
    可是有些人却有一种不正确的观念。他们不大愿意看到别人跑到自己的前面，甚至把别人的前进看成是对自己、对本单位不利的因素。这种思想，实质上是资本主义制度下的“锦标主义”的反映，它和社会主义制度下的革命竞赛是完全不同的两码事。
    我们反对锦标主义，丝毫不是说在社会主义社会里，彼此之间不需要竞赛。相反，我们完全主张开展革命竞赛，这是推动社会生产发展的很好的办法。什么是社会主义竞赛的根本原则呢？概括说来，是“互相学习、互助协作、取长补短、共同提高”。这就是说：先进生产单位，不只是要努力提高生产，保持自己先进，而且要努力促进别人由落后达到先进。先进的单位带领着落后的单位，不断地帮助落后的单位为消除落后而斗争。要消除那种怕被别人超过的不健康心理，相反应当为别人的进步祝贺，同时再努力赶上去，不断促进生产力的发展。
    一浪高一浪，超过，再超过，使我国的社会主义建设跃进再跃进，这是应当提倡的促进方针。西安搪瓷厂已经做出了很好的成绩，我们希望不断地收到这样的好消息！
