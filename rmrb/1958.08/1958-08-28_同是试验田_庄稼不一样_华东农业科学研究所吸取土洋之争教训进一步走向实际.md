　　Same Experimental Field, Different Crops:
    East China Agricultural Science Institute Learns from "Native vs. Foreign" Controversy and Moves Further Towards Practicality
    (Our dispatch) This year, under the correct leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, the East China Agricultural Science Institute examined and criticized its serious shortcomings in the past, which were detachment from production, detachment from reality, and detachment from the masses. It proposed a working method of "integrating native and foreign methods, with native methods as the mainstay," and integrating internal and external resources, and upper and lower levels. This has led to great progress in research work. The specific methods are: First, in combination with the needs of agricultural production in Jiangsu Province, it organized a team of about 100 technical cadres to work with other units to establish a long-term agricultural science and technology network throughout the province. Second, it organized twelve comprehensive working groups in different producing areas for double-cropping rice, rice-wheat rotation, northern Jiangsu, and Huangyan tangerines, etc., using the commune as a base, focusing on key problems that urgently need to be solved in local production, and conducting experiments in conjunction with high-yield experimental fields to strengthen technical guidance. Third, within the Agricultural Science Institute, it cultivated six types of high-yield experimental fields for double-cropping rice, rice-wheat rotation, single-cropping cotton, double-cropping cotton, wheat, corn, and sweet potatoes. For each type of experimental field, it hired two skilled farmers, adopted a method of combining native and foreign experts, assigned specific personnel to specific fields, and provided specific technical guidance in the field to cultivate high yields. Fourth, under the unified leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, it organized comprehensive investigation groups to conduct key investigations on summer crops in areas such as northern Jiangsu. Because the direction of the above work is correct and the approach is appropriate, agricultural research work is further integrated with production leaps.

    After adopting various methods to connect with reality, many technicians further realized in their practical work that agricultural production is a comprehensive science, and the specific operations are quite complex. After comparing this with the past work methods in the laboratory, which were scattered, isolated, independent, and focused on trivial details, they began to establish a comprehensive research perspective of production. In the past, those who specialized in soil and did not ask about other things have now begun to learn about fertilizers and cultivation knowledge from the perspective of high yield, summarize the experiences of the masses, and conduct collective research. The technical personnel in the countryside, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, work and experiment at the same time; they impart technology and inspect production at the same time, and train agricultural technical cadres for various counties. They are both students and teachers, inspectors and researchers, and are generally welcomed by the masses in various places. The working group in Huaiyin, due to overcoming conservative ideas and relying on the masses, boldly adopted the "Gong 17" improved variety from the Northeast. Therefore, they cooperated with the prefectural committee cadres to plant early rice in the experimental field of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yugou Township, a new rice area, with a yield of more than 1,700 catties per mu, creating a high yield more than twice that of the local masses.

    After establishing the opposition between native and foreign experts in the Agricultural Science Institute, the field production situation has greatly improved compared with previous years. When the single-cropping cotton field needed pruning, at the field meeting, the skilled farmer Hu Linlou suggested immediate pruning, believing that pruning would ensure sufficient sunlight and increase the nutrient content of the cotton bolls, which could guarantee increased production. Hua Xingnai, director of the Special Crops Department, believed that the impact was not significant, and there was no need to prune, and strive to produce more cotton bolls. The native and foreign experts refused to give in to each other, and finally conducted a comparative experiment in a field according to the opinions of both parties. A few days later, the unpruned buds showed signs of falling off, and the pruned cotton grew very well. At this time, Director Hua was convinced. Because the experimental field was carefully cultivated and the measures were implemented in a timely manner, it also promoted the management of large field crops.

    However, in the process of implementing the principle of "integrating native and foreign methods," due to blindly believing in books and foreign experts, the rice production in the high-yield experimental field suffered serious losses. As a result of the harvest, the yield was only 872 catties per mu, far behind the high-yield experiments of the agricultural cooperatives.

    After half a year of practice, the leaders of the Agricultural Science Institute summarized the work, accepted the lessons, and further clarified the importance of political leadership in research work. They decided that the director should personally take charge of the high-yield experimental fields, implement yield-increasing measures to set an example, and according to the workers' requirements, allocate three mu of late rice to be cultivated entirely by the workers, and establish an opposition to foreign experts, in order to promote the further development of agricultural scientific experiments.

### 同是试验田　庄稼不一样  华东农业科学研究所吸取土洋之争教训进一步走向实际

　　同是试验田　庄稼不一样
    华东农业科学研究所吸取土洋之争教训进一步走向实际
    本报讯　今年年初，华东农业科学研究所在江苏省委的正确领导下，检查批判了过去脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的严重缺点，提出了“土洋并举，以土为主”的内外、上下、左右三大结合的工作方法，研究工作有很大进步。具体的方法是：第一，结合江苏省农业生产的需要，组织一百人左右的技术干部和其他单位结合，长期下乡组织全省农业科学技术网。第二，在不同产区组织了双季稻、稻麦两熟、淮北、黄岩柑桔等十二个综合工作组，以社为基点，抓住当地生产上迫切需要解决的关键问题，结合丰产试验田进行试验，加强技术指导。第三，在农业科学研究所内栽培了双季稻、稻麦两熟、一熟棉花、二熟棉花、小麦、玉米、山芋等六种类型的高额丰产试验田，每一种试验田都聘请二位生产能手，采取土洋专家共同结合的办法，定人定田，进行田间具体的技术指导，培养高额丰产。第四，在省委统一领导下，组织综合考察组先后在淮北、苏北等地区对夏收作物进行重点考察。因为以上这些工作的方向正确，路子对头，使农业研究工作进一步与生产跃进结合起来。
    采取多种办法联系实际之后，许多技术人员在实际工作中进一步体会到农业生产是一门综合性的科学，具体操作相当复杂，他们和过去在实验室里进行分散的、孤立的、单干的、钻牛角尖的工作方法对照之后，开始树立了综合研究的生产观点。过去只专土壤不问其他的人，现在也开始从丰产出发，学习肥料和栽培的知识，总结群众经验，进行集体研究。在农村里的技术人员，他们都在党委的统一领导下，一面劳动，一面试验；一面传授技术，一面检查生产，替各县培训农业技术干部。他们是学员也是教员，是检查员也是研究员，受到各地群众的普遍欢迎。在淮阴的工作组，由于克服了保守思想，依靠群众，大胆采用了东北“公十七号”良种，因此，他们和地委干部合作在新稻区渔沟乡五星农业社种植的早稻试验田亩产一千七百多斤，创造了超过当地群众二倍以上的高额丰产。
    农业科学研究所内树立了土洋专家的对立面之后，田间生产情况比往年大大好转，在一熟棉田需要整枝的时候，在田头会议上，生产能手胡林楼建议立即进行整枝，他认为整枝后日照充足，棉铃养分增加，可以保证增产。特作系主任华兴鼐认为影响不大，不必整枝，争取多结一些棉铃。土洋专家双方互不服输，最后就按照双方意见在一块田里作比较试验，几天之后，没有整枝的花蕾有脱落现象，整过枝的棉花长得很好，这时，华主任才服气了。因为试验田耕作精细，措施贯彻及时，因此也推动了大田作物的管理工作。
    但是，在贯彻“土洋并举”方针的过程中，因为迷信书本，迷信洋专家，以致丰产试验田的水稻生产遭受到严重的损失。收获结果，亩产只有八百七十二斤，远远地落后于农业社的丰产试验。
    经过半年来的实践，农业科学研究所的领导上总结了工作，接受了教训，进一步明确了在研究工作中必须政治挂帅的重要意义，决定由所长亲自动手抓丰产试验田，贯彻增产措施先做样子，并根据工人的要求，划出三亩晚稻全部交给工人栽培，和洋专家树立对立面，以促进农业科学试验工作的进一步发展。　　　　（史越峨）
