Xinhua News Agency Report: Asian and African countries' public and media unanimously demand that the UN General Assembly emergency meeting should force the U.S. and Britain to withdraw their troops from the Middle East, and point out that this is another serious test for the United Nations.

In the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic, large and small gatherings are being held to angrily protest the aggressive policies of the United States and Britain in the Arab East, and resolutely demand that U.S. and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

A mass rally was held in Heliopolis, near Cairo, on the 11th, at which a resolution was unanimously adopted calling on the United Nations to demand the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The resolution said that the continued presence of U.S. and British troops in the Arab East is a threat to world peace and security.

The resolution also expressed full support for President Nasser's policy of defending the independence and national interests of the Arab people and resisting imperialist aggression.

The medical faculty of Cairo University also held a gathering on the 11th to protest the aggression of the United States and Britain in the Arab East.

Cairo newspapers published many articles condemning the Western imperialists' conspiracy to forcibly rule the people of Arab countries. In commenting on the convening of the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session, the newspapers emphasized that the UN General Assembly should take resolute measures to stop U.S. and British aggression and eliminate the threat of war.

The "People's Newspaper" in Cairo demanded in an editorial on the 12th that the United Nations General Assembly meeting on the 13th must first of all ensure that all foreign troops are completely and quickly withdrawn from the territories of Arab countries.

The editorial of "Al-Akhbar" said that this meeting of the United Nations General Assembly will be another test for the United Nations. It said: "What the General Assembly should do is to demand the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East, although it is expected that Western countries will take various measures to justify their intervention."

"Al-Ahram" demanded that the United Nations General Assembly make a decision as soon as possible to withdraw U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

"Al-Gomhouria" said that the decision of the United Nations General Assembly can only be effective if it can be accepted by the people of the Middle East countries.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on the 13th that the only actions disrupting the situation in the Middle East were the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by the armed forces of the United States and Britain; therefore, the only solution was for the U.S. and British troops to withdraw from there.

The "Indonesia Torch" said that solving the Middle East problem is very closely related to the problem of foreign troops stationed in Lebanon and Jordan. Until this problem is solved, other problems in the Middle East will not be so easily solved. Therefore, it is hoped that this emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly will be able to force the U.S. and British troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

The Burmese language newspaper "Vanguard" published an editorial on the 12th commenting on the U.S. proposal to the United Nations General Assembly regarding the so-called "indirect aggression," saying that this was a myth fabricated "in an attempt to cover up the fact that they (the United States and Britain) interfere in Middle Eastern countries and that their capitalists monopolize oil."

"Vanguard" pointed out that "there are no military blocs and military alliances initiated by the Soviet Union in the Middle East," while "in fact, the United States and Britain are carrying out armed aggression in Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Jordan." Therefore, "this myth about the threat of Soviet aggression is unfounded."

"Vanguard" suggested that "the Burmese (at the United Nations) delegation should reject the U.S. claim of 'indirect aggression' by the Soviet Union and the UAR, and should support the demand for the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Middle Eastern countries."

　　亚非舆论要求联大制止侵略
　　指出联合国面临又一次考验
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：亚非各国公众和舆论一致要求联大紧急会议应迫使美英从中东撤军，并指出这是对联合国的又一次严重考验。
    阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区正在纷纷举行大小集会，愤怒抗议美国和英国侵略阿拉伯东方的政策，并坚决要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    开罗近郊的希利奥利斯11日举行群众大会，会上一致通过一项决议，呼吁联合国要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。决议说，美英军队继续驻在阿拉伯东方就是对世界和平和安全的威胁。
    决议还表示完全支持纳赛尔总统所执行的捍卫阿拉伯人民的独立和民族利益、抵御帝国主义侵略的政策。
    开罗大学医学系11日也举行集会，抗议美英两国对阿拉伯东方的侵略。
    开罗报纸发表许多文章谴责西方帝国主义硬要统治阿拉伯各国人民的阴谋。各报在评论联合国大会召开紧急特别会议时强调说，联合国大会应当采取坚决措施来制止美英侵略和消除战争威胁。
    开罗“人民报”12日在社论中要求13日举行的联合国大会会议首先必须使所有外国部队全部迅速撤离阿拉伯国家领土。
    “消息报”的社论说，联合国大会这次会议将是对联合国的又一次考验。它说：“大会应当做的是要求外国军队立即撤出中东，虽然预料西方国家将采取各种手段来为它们的干涉进行辩解。”
      “金字塔报”要求联合国大会赶紧作出决议使美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。
    “共和国报”说，联合国大会的决定只有在能为中东各国人民接受的情况下才能发生效力。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”13日说，唯一扰乱中东局势的行动是美国和英国的武装部队对黎巴嫩和约旦的占领；因此，唯一的解决办法是美英军队从那里撤退。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，解决中东问题是同外国军队驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦的问题非常紧密地联系在一起的。在这个问题没有解决以前，中东的其他问题就不会那么容易解决。因此，希望这次联合国大会紧急会议能够迫使美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    缅甸文日报“先锋报”12日发表社论评论美国准备向联合国大会提出的关于所谓“间接侵略”的提案说，这是“企图掩盖它们（美国和英国）干涉中东国家以及它们的资本家垄断石油这一事实”而捏造的神话。
      “先锋报”指出，“在中东没有苏联发起的军事集团和军事联盟”，而“事实上是美国和英国在埃及、叙利亚、也门、黎巴嫩和约旦进行武装侵略”。因此“这种关于苏联侵略威胁的神话是没有根据的”。
      “先锋报”建议，“缅甸（在联合国的）代表团应当拒绝美国提出的苏联和阿联‘间接侵略’的说法，并且应当支持主张美英军队撤出中东国家的要求”。
