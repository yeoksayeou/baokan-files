Bi-Weekly International Review
(August 5th to August 19th)
    After frustrating the U.S.-British expanded aggression plan, the Arab people and the people of all countries in the world have continued their efforts to thwart the U.S.-British group's conspiracy to circumvent troop withdrawals and attempt to find a legal guise for expanding aggression at the United Nations Emergency Special Session. The UN Emergency Special Session passed the proposal put forward by ten Arab countries to have the U.S. and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible. But the struggle is not over. From the resolution to the withdrawal of the U.S. and British invading forces, there will be a sharp and complex struggle. Moreover, without continuing serious struggle, it is obviously impossible to get the U.S. and British invading forces to withdraw from the Middle East.

    The Struggle is Not Over
    The UN Emergency Special Session, which opened on August 8, has been consistently running through the struggle of two diametrically opposed lines. From the beginning, the Soviet delegation put forward a proposal to withdraw the U.S. and British invading forces from Lebanon and Jordan, while Eisenhower's six-point plan, which flaunted "peace in the Near East," not only evaded the issue of troop withdrawal, but also attempted to establish a "United Nations Peace Force" to continue the aggression. Nevertheless, the United States still cannot prevent the issue of troop withdrawal from becoming the focus of the meeting. Most member states, especially the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the United Arab Republic, Iraq, India, Indonesia and other Asian and African countries, and Argentina, Mexico and other Latin American countries, which stand at the forefront of the anti-aggression struggle, condemned the U.S.-British aggression and stated that the U.S.-British troop withdrawal must be resolved.

    According to Lippmann, "The problem facing the United States is how to prevent this UN meeting from becoming an open court to try the Americans and the British for their armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan." Under the painstaking planning of the U.S. State Department and "psychological warfare" advisers, Eisenhower decided to personally come forward, and in his speech, he did his best to reverse black and white, deceive and intimidate. He described the efforts of the people of all countries to stop U.S.-British aggression as "illegal," while describing U.S.-British aggression as "helping small countries maintain their independence"; he boasted about the Middle East regional development plan, disguising the ferocious U.S. imperialism as a philanthropist who cares about "the prospects of a modern Arab society"; but he could not hide the fox tail of aggression, and he did not dare to talk about when the U.S. military plans to withdraw, even threatening the United Nations to take action and establish a "United Nations Peace Force" to allow the U.S. and British to occupy Lebanon and Jordan for a long time; he further threatened that the United States "reserves the right to send its own troops to other small countries." Eisenhower's shot did not fire. The UAR, Iraq and other Arab countries' radio stations and newspapers generally criticized it. The Cairo "People's Daily" accused Eisenhower's speech of "confusing people, covering up his crimes, justifying aggression, complicating the situation, and threatening the Arabs by announcing that the United States will stubbornly pursue the old policy that has led us to the edge of the abyss."

    The "five-point proposal" put forward by Hammarskjold on the opening day of the conference, which "represented the United States' attitude towards the Middle East issue" (New York Herald Tribune), and the proposal later drafted by the United States behind the scenes by Norway, Canada, Colombia, Panama, Liberia, Denmark and Paraguay, also fell into the same sad situation as Eisenhower's six-point plan. The U.S. delegation, led by Dulles, carried out intense activities within the conference to win over supporters of the seven-nation proposal, especially for the Latin American countries that play a decisive role in the U.S. majority voting machine, both persuading, intimidating, and threatening. However, all these activities have not obtained the guarantee that the seven-nation proposal will obtain the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the General Assembly. Except for the representatives of Shamun and Hussein, who were supported by U.S. and British bayonets, all representatives of Arab countries unanimously opposed the proposal.

    The huge momentum of the people of all countries to stop U.S.-British aggression has made a new and strong atmosphere in this UN meeting: justice overcomes injustice, peace overcomes war, and the call for U.S.-British troop withdrawal overwhelms the large chorus directed by Eisenhower. The U.S. majority voting machine "is not sure."

    The UN Emergency Special Session finally ended with the unanimous adoption of the proposal of ten Arab countries.

    Dulles and Lloyd and others have tried their best to distort the essence of the Arab proposal, saying that this proposal is "substantially the same" as the bankrupt seven-nation proposal, and even want to say that it meets the "requirements" of the United States. This fully exposes the U.S. conspiracy to delay troop withdrawal. Therefore, although the UN Emergency Special Session has passed the proposal of the Arab countries, as long as the U.S. and British troops have not withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan for a day, the situation will not ease for a day. Dulles publicly stated: "No proposal, in itself, will solve the Near East problem." He also said that the United States will demand consideration of the establishment of a "United Nations Peace Force" at the UN General Assembly in September. A British Foreign Office spokesman also said that he was unwilling to say any date for the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan, and would make a decision based on the results of Hammarskjold's mission in the Middle East. It can be seen that the passage of the Arab countries' proposal is only the beginning of the struggle to demand U.S.-British troop withdrawal.

    Ostrich and Dead Souls

    When U.S. imperialism was facing the huge momentum of stopping aggression from West Asia, the whole world, to the UN Emergency Special Session, and was in a dilemma and trembling, it issued a so-called memorandum of non-recognition of China, instructed a small group of Chiang Kai-shek groups to step up provocations in the Taiwan Strait, and sent Marines to invade Singapore. This series of frantic activities by the United States are all desperate struggles to cooperate with its die-hard policy of confronting the world's wave of peace.

    The "New York Times" revealed the truth. It turned out that the reason why the U.S. State Department chose the timing of the UN Emergency Special Session to issue documents hostile to China was because the United States was frightened by the increasing international prestige and status of the great People's Republic of China and the powerful movement of 600 million Chinese people supporting the anti-aggression struggle of the people of the Near and Middle East. In fact, the U.S. State Department's memorandum itself cannot hide this extreme fear and cowardice of the United States. While Washington is sparing no effort to repeat the same old tune of not being able to recognize the new China, it inadvertently reveals that it is so and so afraid of the new China. It fears that it will "seriously frustrate" the U.S. "policy" of occupying Taiwan and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group, fears that it will "seriously damage" the U.S. manipulation of the United Nations, fears that it will "seriously hinder" the U.S. "goal" of invading the Far East, fears that the "embargo" will completely go bankrupt, and fears that the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas" will not work... In fact, Washington knows very well in its heart that the new Chinese people do not take the issue of U.S. recognition to heart at all, but it cannot stop fighting against the windmills it has created itself for a day.

    Public opinion in various countries' mockery, contempt, criticism and criticism of the U.S. State Department's memorandum is like a tide, which has been inundating around Washington's throne. Not to mention the comments of socialist countries and Asian and African peaceful and neutral countries, even many U.S., British, French, and West German bourgeois commentators have ridiculed and criticized the U.S. die-hard attitude towards China as unrealistic to the point of being stupid and ridiculous. They regard the U.S. policy toward China as a combination of an ostrich (U.S. "Nation" Weekly) and a dead soul (British "Punch" Weekly). The American ostrich not only buries its head in the sand, but also gets into its own pocket filled with dead souls like the Chiang Kai-shek group. Today, this policy seems particularly ridiculous, because the facts prove that China's prestige is increasing day by day with the "leapfrog development of the Chinese economy" (French "Le Monde") and the implementation of a policy of supporting the struggle of the people of all countries against colonialism and imperialist aggression.

    Similarly, the United States' attempt to use the tense situation created by the U.S.-British aggression in the Near and Middle East to expand military threats in the Taiwan Strait and the Far East for blackmail and intimidation is also futile. Premier Zhou Enlai recently pointed out that the United States' practice of creating tension in the Far East and the world will never achieve its desired goals. On the contrary, it will make us more vigilant about the U.S. aggression conspiracy, make peace-loving countries and people see the U.S. imperialist face more clearly, and will eventually lead to the bankruptcy and failure of the U.S. aggression policy.

    The provocative actions of U.S. warships and Marines entering Singapore have aroused the anger and opposition of the people of Southeast Asian countries. It ridiculously defends itself, saying that U.S. troops are only temporarily in Singapore for "entertainment" or so-called "routine visits," vainly trying to cover up its plan to expand aggression in the Far East. But a U.S. Navy spokesman slapped himself severely, he publicly announced: "The Marines of the U.S. Seventh Fleet stationed in the Pacific can be used at any time to fulfill the obligations undertaken by the United States in the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf." This links the U.S. aggression activities in West Asia and the Far East. However, this will not have any other result than making the embarrassed U.S. imperialism expose its aggressive face everywhere, causing the encirclement and opposition of the people of all countries everywhere, and falling into greater and greater isolation.

　　半月国际述评
　　（八月五日到八月十九日）
    阿拉伯人民和世界各国人民在挫败了美英扩大侵略计划以后，再接再厉地在联大紧急特别会议上，挫败了美英集团规避撤军，并企图找寻扩大侵略的合法外衣的阴谋活动。联大紧急特别会议通过了十个阿拉伯国家提出的要美英军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案。但斗争没有结束。从决议到美英侵略军撤出，还将有一场尖锐而复杂的斗争。而且，不继续进行严重的斗争，要美英侵略军撤出中东，这显然是不可能的。
    斗争并未结束
    8月8日召开的联大紧急特别会议，一直贯穿着两条截然不同的路线的斗争。苏联代表团一开始就提出了要美英侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案，而艾森豪威尔提出的标榜“近东和平”的六点计划，却不仅回避撤军问题，而且企图建立一支“联合国和平部队”来继续进行侵略。尽管如此，美国仍不能排除撤军问题成为会议讨论的中心。大多数会员国，特别是站在反侵略斗争前列的苏联和其他社会主义国家、阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、印度、印度尼西亚等亚非国家，和阿根廷、墨西哥等拉丁美洲国家的代表，谴责了美英侵略行为，表示必须解决美英撤军问题。
    按照李普曼的说法，“美国面临的问题是，如何防止联大这次会议变成公开的法庭来审判美国人和英国人对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉”。在美国国务院和“心理战”顾问的苦心策划下，艾森豪威尔决定亲自出马，并在他的演说中，极尽颠倒黑白、哄骗恫吓之能事。他把各国人民制止美英侵略说成“非法”，而把美英侵略说成“帮助小国维持独立”；他大吹大擂中东区域开发计划，把穷凶极恶的美帝国主义打扮成关心“现代化阿拉伯社会的前景”的慈善家；但他藏不住侵略的狐狸尾巴，又不敢谈美军打算什么时候撤退，竟要挟联合国必须采取行动，成立一支“联合国和平部队”，使美英长期侵占黎巴嫩和约旦；他还进一步恫吓说，美国“保留派遣自己的部队到其他小国去的权利”。艾森豪威尔这一炮并没有打响。阿联、伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家的电台、报纸普遍加以抨击。开罗“人民报”指责艾森豪威尔演说是“为了使人迷惑，掩盖他的罪行，为侵略辩解，使局势复杂化，并且宣布美国要固执地追随已把我们引到深渊边缘的老政策，这样来威胁阿拉伯人”。
    美国在大会开幕之日假手哈马舍尔德提出的“代表了美国对中东问题的态度”（纽约先驱论坛报）的“五点建议”，以及后来美国在幕后拟订而由挪威、加拿大、哥伦比亚、巴拿马、利比里亚、丹麦和巴拉圭七国提出的提案，也落到了同艾森豪威尔六点计划同样可悲的局面。以杜勒斯为首的美国代表团曾为拉拢七国提案的支持者，在会内进行了紧张的活动，特别是对于在美国多数表决机器中占有决定作用的拉丁美洲国家，又是劝说，又是恫吓，又是威胁。但是，这一切活动，都没有得到使七国提案获得大会三分之二必要多数票的保证。除了美英刺刀支撑下的夏蒙和侯赛因的代表以外，所有阿拉伯国家的代表都一致反对这个提案。
    各国人民制止美英侵略的巨大声势，使这次联大的会议出现了新的强烈气氛：正义压倒非正义、和平压倒战争、要求美英撤军的呼声压倒艾森豪威尔指挥的大合唱。美国多数表决机器“没有把握了”。
    联大紧急特别会议最后以十个阿拉伯国家的提案获得一致通过而告结束。
    杜勒斯和劳埃德之流，竭力歪曲阿拉伯提案的实质，说什么这个提案与破了产的七国提案“大体上是相同的”，甚至想说成符合美国的“要求”。这完全暴露了美国企图拖延撤军的阴谋诡计。因之，联大紧急特别会议虽已通过了阿拉伯国家的提案，但是只要美英军队一天没有撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，局势就一天没有缓和。杜勒斯公开表示：“任何提案，其本身是不会解决近东问题的。”他还说，美国将要在9月举行的联大常会上要求考虑建立“联合国和平部队”问题。英国外交部发言人也表示，他不愿说出英军撤出约旦的任何日期，要看哈马舍尔德在中东的使命结果如何，再作决定。由此可见，阿拉伯国家提案的通过，只是要求美英撤军斗争的开始。
    鸵鸟和死魂灵
    美帝国主义在面对着从西亚、全世界到联大紧急特别会议一片制止侵略的浩大声势而进退两难、手脚发颤的时候，发表了所谓不承认中国的备忘录，指使一小撮蒋介石集团在台湾海峡加紧挑衅，并派遣海军陆战队侵入新加坡。美国这一连串的疯狂活动，都是为了配合它死硬地对抗全世界和平浪潮的政策的绝望挣扎。
    “纽约时报”道破了真象。原来，美国国务院所以选择联大紧急特别会议召开的时机，发表敌对中国的文件，是由于美国被伟大的中华人民共和国日益提高的国际威望和地位、六亿中国人民支持中近东人民反侵略斗争的强大运动吓破了胆。其实，美国国务院的备忘录本身就不能掩盖美国这种极度的恐惧和卑怯。华盛顿在不惜再次重弹这样那样不能承认新中国的陈腔滥调的时候，无意中暴露了它是这样那样地害怕新中国。它怕“严重地挫伤”美国侵占台湾和扶植蒋介石集团的“政策”，怕“严重损害”美国对联合国的操纵，怕“严重地妨碍”美国侵略远东的“目标”，怕“禁运”彻底破产，怕美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋行不通……。事实上，华盛顿心里很明白，新中国人民根本不把美国承认不承认的问题放在眼中，但它却一天也不能停止同它自己制造的风车作斗争。
    各国舆论对美国国务院备忘录的嘲笑、鄙视、抨击和批评，有如潮涌，一直淹到华盛顿的宝座周围。且不说社会主义国家和亚非和平中立国家的评论，就是许多美、英、法、西德资产阶级评论家们，也纷纷讥笑和指责美国敌对中国的死硬态度已不现实到了愚蠢可笑的地步。他们把美国的对华政策看作鸵鸟（美国“民族”周刊）和死魂灵（英国“笨拙周刊”）的结合。美国鸵鸟不仅把头埋在沙里，而且钻到了它自己装着蒋介石集团之类的死魂灵的口袋里。在今天，这种政策所以显得特别可笑，是因为事实证明：中国的威望正在随着“中国经济飞跃发展”（法国“世界报”）和执行支持各国人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义侵略斗争的政策，而日益提高。
    同样地，美国想利用美英侵略中近东所造成的紧张局势，在台湾海峡和远东地区扩大军事威胁，进行讹诈和恫吓，也是徒劳的。周恩来总理最近指出：美国在远东和全世界制造紧张局势的做法，绝不可能达到它所期望的目的，相反地却会使我们对美国侵略阴谋更加提高警惕，使爱好和平的国家和人民更加看清美国的帝国主义面目，最后必将导致美国侵略政策的破产和失败。
    美国军舰和海军陆战队进入新加坡的挑衅行动，引起了东南亚国家人民的愤怒和反对。它荒谬地进行辩解，说什么美国部队仅仅是暂时到新加坡去“娱乐”或进行所谓“例行访问”，妄想掩盖它在远东扩大侵略活动的计划。但美国海军部发言人狠狠地打了自己的嘴巴，他公开宣布：“驻扎在太平洋的美国第七舰队的海军陆战队，随时可以用来履行美国在印度洋或波斯湾所承担的义务”。这就把美国在西亚和远东的侵略活动联系起来了。但是，这除了使狼狈不堪的美帝国主义到处暴露自己的侵略面目，到处引起各国人民的包围和反对，陷于越来越大的孤立以外，是不会有别的结果的。
