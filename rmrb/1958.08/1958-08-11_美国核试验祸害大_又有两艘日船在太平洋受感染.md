　　U.S. Nuclear Tests Cause Havoc
　　Two More Japanese Ships Infected in the Pacific

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Two more Japanese ships and their crews in the Pacific Ocean have been harmed by atomic radiation caused by U.S. nuclear tests.

According to the "Japan Times," the "Fuyo Maru," which recently returned to Yokohama, and the "Eihomaru," which is sailing 900 nautical miles from the explosion site, have both discovered radioactive dust of very high density. Most of the sailors are suffering from headaches as a result, and two sailors have experienced a sharp drop in white blood cell count.

The All Japan Seamen's Union has written to the company owners, demanding that they immediately instruct the "Eihomaru" to enter a nearby port and take measures to treat the sailors on board.

　　美国核试验祸害大
　　又有两艘日船在太平洋受感染
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：又有两艘日本轮船和船上的海员在太平洋上遭到美国进行核试验所造成的原子辐射的伤害。
    据“日本时报”报道，不久前回到横滨的“风宇川丸”和正在距爆炸地点九百浬处航行的“荣凤丸”都发现了密度很大的放射性微尘，大部分海员因此患了头疼病，有两个海员的白血球剧减。
    日本全国海员工会写信给企业主，要求立即指示“荣凤丸”驶入附近港口停泊，并且采取措施医治船上的海员。
