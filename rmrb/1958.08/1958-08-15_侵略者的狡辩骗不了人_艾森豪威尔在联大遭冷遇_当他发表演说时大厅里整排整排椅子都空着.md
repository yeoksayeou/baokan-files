Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: Despite the United States deploying all its propaganda machines to hype up Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session on the 13th, many Western news and reports clearly revealed a somber mood. This mood indicated that the reaction to Eisenhower's speech in the UN General Assembly Hall was far from "enthusiastic."

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from the United Nations on the 13th, when a "smiling" Eisenhower entered the venue to deliver his speech, "rows and rows of chairs were empty, and even the public gallery was not crowded." Associated Press reporter Scali's report stated, "As Eisenhower succinctly outlined his plan in a thirty-minute speech, diplomats listened politely, but with apparent lack of enthusiasm."

It is reported that the reaction of representatives from most countries attending the conference to Eisenhower's speech was lukewarm. Some representatives from neutralist countries did not applaud. Iraqi representative Jawad said, "There is nothing new in this speech." Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Engen believed that Eisenhower's speech had "some loopholes that need to be filled." Representatives from more countries stated that they would "wait and see" before they had the opportunity to study Eisenhower's proposals.

The report said that representatives from the twenty Latin American countries were also reluctant to express their attitude. It is said that these countries are "very sensitive to the issue of foreign troops stationed [on their soil]."

　　侵略者的狡辩骗不了人
　　艾森豪威尔在联大遭冷遇
　　当他发表演说时大厅里整排整排椅子都空着
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：尽管美国开动了所有的宣传机器为艾森豪威尔13日在联合国大会紧急特别会议上的演说大吹大擂，西方的许多消息和报道却明显地流露出来一种黯然的情绪。这种情绪表明，艾森豪威尔的演说在联合国大会会议厅里的反应远不是那么“热烈。”
    据法新社13日从联合国发出的一条消息说，当“面带笑容”的艾森豪威尔走进会场去发表演说时，大厅里“整排整排的椅子都空着，甚至公众旁听席也不拥挤”。美联社记者斯卡利的报道中说，“当艾森豪威尔在三十分钟演说中扼要地叙述他的计划时，外交官们很有礼貌地倾听着，但是显然没有什么热情。”
    据报道，参加大会的大多数国家的代表对艾森豪威尔演说的反应是冷淡的。一些中立主义国家的代表没有鼓掌。伊拉克的代表贾瓦德说，“这个演说没有什么新东西。”挪威外交副大臣恩根认为艾森豪威尔的演说中“有一些必须弥补的漏洞”。更多国家的代表表示，在他们有机会研究艾森豪威尔的建议之前，要“采取等着瞧的态度”。
    消息说，拉丁美洲的二十个国家的代表也迟迟不愿表示态度。据说，这些国家对“驻扎外国军队的问题非常敏感”。
