Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 17th: A central rally for the "International Day of Action" to rescue the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," attended by more than two thousand workers and citizens, was held in Tokyo this afternoon. The rally was organized by the "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasures Council to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the "Matsukawa Incident." Five of the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants and their family members participated in the rally.

　　The rally passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese Supreme Court must try this fabricated case based on the facts, and that judges with prejudice and manipulation should not be allowed to preside over the trial; at the same time, it demanded the prior release of the defendants and a thorough reinvestigation of the truth of the incident.

　　The resolution strongly condemned the prosecution's concealment and destruction of evidence in the case, believing that this behavior undermined justice and the authority of the court.

　　The rally passed an appeal to the people of the world and the people of Japan. The appeal emphasized that the acquittal of all defendants must be won, because the trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" is related to the protection of basic human rights and the democracy and peace of Japan.

　　The appeal called on the Japanese people and the people of the world to launch a struggle anytime and anywhere to demand that the Japanese Supreme Court declare the defendants innocent in order to win the trial of this case. At the same time, it called for financial assistance to the defendants.

　　Secretary-General of the Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party Yoshio Shiga, Ryuko Ooyama, and representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions attending the Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, Grassy and Peruvian representative Rendon, addressed the meeting respectively, unanimously encouraging the struggle to win the trial of the "Matsukawa Incident."

　　The rally announced that it had received RMB 6,000 yuan and RMB 8,000 yuan in condolences from the Chinese People's Relief Association and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, respectively, as well as telegrams and letters. The audience applauded enthusiastically to express their gratitude. The rally also specifically passed a resolution to express its gratitude to the two Chinese people's organizations for their condolences and telegrams of support.

　　The masses participating in the rally finally held a demonstration in the streets.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: According to TASS, Tokyo, August 16th: The Japanese "Akahata" newspaper published on the 16th a statement by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on the occasion of the "International Day of Action" for the rescue of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" on August 17th.

　　The statement pointed out that the "Matsukawa Incident" was fabricated by American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries nine years ago in order to suppress democratic forces, thereby laying the foundation for launching the Korean War and strengthening their rule in Japan. To this end, the Japanese Communist Party calls on the Japanese people to unite and fight to rescue those who have been sentenced to imprisonment due to the "Matsukawa Incident."

　　The statement said that their rescue will be a great contribution to the overall struggle for peace, democracy, and independence. The statement demanded: Release those imprisoned for the "Matsukawa Incident," and punish those who fabricated this incident!
