American President Eisenhower, in his letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev on August 1st, tried his best to portray himself as a defender of the rights of small countries, insisting that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-nation summit to discuss the issue of American and British armed aggression in the Middle East was "ignoring the wishes, dignity, and indeed the security of small countries." However, even as Eisenhower was playing with these beautiful words, he was ordering American diplomatic officials to create a rebellion in Haiti to subvert the legitimate government, and the former American military attache to Haiti participated in this rebellion. Not long before this, the United States was also plotting a reactionary coup in Venezuela aimed at restoring a pro-American dictatorial regime. And the day before Eisenhower sent his letter "respecting" small countries, the U.S. government, under the pretext of defending the water supply system of its Guantanamo naval base in Cuba, was preparing to send troops to Cuba for armed intervention. The United States' own aggressive actions completely exposed Eisenhower's hypocritical mask.

Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba are all small countries in Central and South America. The people of Haiti and Venezuela drove out the notorious American agents and dictatorial rulers Magloire and Jiménez, respectively, more than a year and half a year ago. The Cuban people are also waging a heroic struggle against the reactionary rule of dictator Batista. The flames of fighting for freedom and breaking free from American enslavement are spreading like wildfire in these countries. The reason why the United States wants to subvert the governments of Haiti and Venezuela is that these governments are supported and endorsed by the people; they are not obedient agents of the United States, and they do not suit the wishes of American aggressors. And the reason why the United States wants to send troops to Cuba, as the New York "Daily News" pointed out, is because it is "colluding with Batista's dictatorial government" and wants to support this unpopular government and suppress the people's resistance. In this respect, it is exactly the same as the U.S. sending troops to Lebanon to support the Chamoun clique. The United States uses the means of inciting rebellion and "coup" conspiracies to subvert the governments supported by the people of other countries, and uses the method of direct armed intervention to support the reactionary ruling groups opposed by the people of other countries. And calling this "respecting" the independence of small countries and "respecting" the existence of legitimate governments, is there any more despicable act or more shameless sophistry than this?

The United States has a hideous and bloody history of instigating riots and creating "coups" in Latin American countries to subvert legitimate governments, even to the point of carrying out open armed aggression. Not to mention the distant past, but only in the ten years from 1948 to 1958 after the war, the United States carried out eleven major subversive activities in Latin America. For example, in 1951, at the instigation of American capitalists who monopolized Bolivia's tin industry, the American ambassador to Bolivia, Weigas, instigated a "coup" that overthrew the Estenssoro government, which was supported by the people. In 1954, the United States launched an armed intervention against Guatemala and subverted the democratic government led by Arbenz. In the same year, Brazilian President Vargas was forced to commit suicide, leaving behind a tearful testament accusing the American aggressors. In addition, the political disturbances that occurred in Peru, El Salvador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Cuba, and other countries were all related to the planning of the United States. The recent events in Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela once again prove that the United States not only "has always" wantonly trampled on and violated the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries, but also "still today" is wantonly trampling on and violating the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries.

During Vice President Nixon's visit to eight South American countries in April and May this year, he was cursed and chased everywhere, which was a manifestation of the Latin American people's extreme resentment of the American aggressors. This time, the United States' subversive conspiracies against Haiti and Venezuela, and its attempts at armed intervention in Cuba, have also been met with stern condemnation from Latin American countries and peoples who are determined to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, as well as from all righteous people in the world. Haitian President Duvalier severely condemned the U.S. plot against the Haitian government as an act of international banditry at a press conference on August 1st.

The U.S. imperialist's gangster behavior of arbitrarily violating the independence and sovereignty of other countries is not limited to Latin America, nor is it limited to small countries. The despicable activities of its sinister hands can also be seen in other parts of the world. People still remember how the United States created "coups" and "filled vacuums" in the Middle Eastern Arab countries. The "coup" that forced Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh to step down in 1953 was masterminded by Henderson, the former American ambassador to Iran, while Colonel McKillan, the head of the U.S. military advisory group, directly served as the commander-in-chief of the riots. In 1957, the United States instigated a "coup" in Jordan and subverted the Nabulsi cabinet, which was pursuing a policy of national independence. Then, the United States carried out armed threats against Syria, and even bought assassins, attempting to assassinate Nasser on the day of the referendum to elect the president of the United Arab Republic. The United States' despicable interference in the struggle of the Indonesian government and people to suppress domestic rebellion has not yet completely stopped. In addition, in many countries in Asia, one can cite disputes and conspiracies created by Americans with all kinds of titles. During this invasion of the Middle East, the United States once again flagrantly disregarded international law and violated the airspace of Austria, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia. All this shows that the United States "has always" and "still today" does not take the independence and sovereignty of other countries seriously. American imperialism is the mortal enemy of all small countries in the world and all countries that are unwilling to accept its enslavement and control.

Eisenhower described this U.S. armed aggression against the Middle East region, first and foremost against Lebanon, as an effort to assist a small country "subjected to external indirect aggression" to "maintain its independence." However, people know that Eisenhower declared on July 15, the day after he sent troops to the Middle East, in his nationwide radio address, that the reason why the United States had to send troops to the Middle East was because "in Iraq a well-organized military action had overthrown the legally constituted government;" and "Lebanon, this small country, has been in civil war for nearly two months." Aren't these reasons Eisenhower said before and after completely contradictory? Since the United States believes that the new government of Iraq is not legitimate and that the overthrown Faisal dynasty is the legitimate government, then why does the United States now have to announce its recognition of the new government of Iraq? Since the United States has expressed "consistent" respect for "Lebanon, this small country," why has it rudely interfered in its internal affairs? And everyone knows that before the American troops occupied Lebanon, Lebanon had not suffered any "external indirect aggression" of the kind Eisenhower described, and its independence was not threatened by any external forces. This has been repeatedly proven by the two reports published by the United Nations observer group. What exists there is only the struggle of the Lebanese opposition against the Chamoun clique, the agent of Anglo-American imperialism, which is purely a matter of Lebanon's internal affairs. The United States sent troops to occupy Lebanon, which is a rude interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Comparing the U.S. armed intervention in the Middle East with its subversive activities in Haiti and Venezuela, the American aggressors are even more unable to justify themselves. Since the United States has repeatedly said that it wants to maintain legitimate governments, why does it try every means to subvert the legitimate governments of Haiti and Venezuela and other countries? It can be seen that the U.S. aggressive behavior in the Middle East, like its aggressive behavior in Haiti and Venezuela, is a violation of the independence and sovereignty of these small countries, and is a naked act of piracy to re-enslave and continue to enslave these small countries.

Countless facts have proven that the United States has consistently and barbarously trampled on the independence and sovereignty of small countries, demanding that the governments of small countries become its obedient slaves. But now the United States pretends to be the protector of small countries, repeatedly saying that it wants to safeguard the interests of small countries. In reality, the true purpose of the United States is simply to attempt to use small countries as tools, use the so-called safeguarding of the interests of small countries as a pretext to cover up American aggressive behavior, and create obstacles to the convening of a summit of major powers. However, the conspiratorial tricks of the aggressors are bound to go bankrupt. The convening of a summit of major powers is the common demand of the people of the world and is an irresistible trend in current international politics. The United States' tricks to undermine the summit of major powers can stop.

    美国帝国主义是小国的死敌
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在8月1日写给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的信里，极力把自己打扮成小国权利的维护者，硬把苏联关于召开五国政府首脑会议，讨论美英武装侵略中东问题的主张，说成是“无视小国的愿望、尊严、事实上还有安全”。但是，艾森豪威尔就在玩弄这些漂亮词句的时候，他却命令美国的外交官员在海地制造了一场颠复合法政府的叛乱，美国前驻海地武官参与了这场叛乱。在这以前不久，美国还在委内瑞拉策划了一次目的在于使亲美独裁政权复辟的反动政变阴谋。而在艾森豪威尔发出他那封“尊重”小国的信件的前一天，美国政府又借口保卫它在古巴的海军基地关塔那摩的供水系统，准备派遣军队到古巴去进行武装干涉。美国以自己的侵略行动彻底拆穿了艾森豪威尔的伪善者的假面具。
    海地、委内瑞拉和古巴，都是中南美洲的小国。海地和委内瑞拉人民分别在一年多和半年多以前赶走了恶名昭彰的美国代理人、独裁统治者马格罗阿和希门尼斯。古巴人民也正在为反对独裁者巴蒂斯塔的反动统治进行着英勇斗争。争取自由和摆脱美国奴役的火焰，在这些国家正以燎原之势延烧起来。美国所以想颠复海地和委内瑞拉的政府，就是因为这些政府是受人民支持和拥护的，它们不是美国的服服贴贴的代理人，它们不合美国侵略者的心意。而美国所以要派兵到古巴去，正如纽约“今日新闻报”所指出的，是因为它“同巴蒂斯塔独裁的政府有勾搭”，它要支持这个不受人民欢迎的政府，镇压人民的反抗。在这一点上，正同美国派兵到黎巴嫩去支持夏蒙集团如出一辙。美国用制造叛乱和“政变”的阴谋手段去颠复别国的人民所拥护的政府，用直接进行武装干涉的办法去支持别国的人民所反对的反动统治集团，而把这叫作“尊重”小国的独立，“尊重”合法政府的存在，难道还有比这更为卑劣的行径，更加无耻的狡辩吗？
    美国在拉丁美洲各国煽动暴乱、制造“政变”来颠复合法政府，直到进行公开的武装侵略，有着丑恶的血腥的历史。远的不说，只是在战后从1948年到1958年的十年期间，美国在拉丁美洲就干了十一次重大的颠复活动。例如1951年，在垄断玻利维亚锡业的美国资本家的指使下，美国驻玻利维亚大使魏加斯策动了一次“政变”，推翻了为人民所支持的艾斯顿索罗政府；1954年，美国发动对危地马拉的武装干涉，颠复了阿本斯所领导的民主政府；同一年，巴西总统瓦加斯被迫自杀，他留下了一封控诉美国侵略者的血泪斑斑的遗书。此外，秘鲁、萨尔瓦多、巴拉圭、哥斯达黎加、古巴等国家所发生的政治骚动，也无一不同美国的策划有关。最近古巴、海地和委内瑞拉的事件，再一次证明：美国不仅“过去一贯”肆意蹂躏和侵犯拉丁美洲国家的独立和主权，而且“今天仍然”在肆意蹂躏和侵犯拉丁美洲国家的独立和主权。
    今年4、5月间，美国副总统尼克松访问南美八个国家，到处受到唾骂和追打，就是拉丁美洲人民极端愤恨美国侵略者的表现。这次美国对海地、委内瑞拉的颠复阴谋，对古巴的武装干涉企图，同样遭到了坚决维护独立和主权的拉丁美洲国家和人民，以及世界上所有正义人士的严正斥责。海地总统杜瓦利埃在8月1日的记者招待会上就曾严厉指责美国策划反对海地政府的阴谋是一种国际土匪行为。
    美帝国主义恣意侵犯别国独立和主权的强盗行为，并不限于拉丁美洲，也不只限于小国。在世界其他地方同样可以看到它的罪恶黑手的卑鄙活动。人们都还记得，美国在中东阿拉伯国家中是怎样制造“政变”和“填补真空”的。1953年迫使伊朗摩萨台首相下台的“政变”，就是美国前驻伊朗大使汉德逊主谋策划的，而美国军事顾问团团长麦克兰上校则直接充当了暴乱的总指挥。1957年，美国在约旦策动“政变”，颠复了执行民族独立政策的纳布西内阁。接着，美国又对叙利亚进行武装威胁，甚至还收买了暗害分子，企图在选举阿联总统的公民投票日暗杀纳赛尔。在印度尼西亚政府和人民镇压国内叛乱的斗争中，美国的卑鄙干涉活动，直到现在也还没有完全停止。此外，在亚洲许多国家里，都可以举出拥有各式各样头衔的美国人所制造的纠纷和阴谋。美国在这次侵略中东期间，又悍然不顾国际公法，侵犯了奥地利、瑞士、沙特阿拉伯的领空。这一切都说明：美国“过去一贯”而且“今天仍然”不把别国的独立和主权放在眼里。美国帝国主义是世界上所有的小国和一切不愿意接受它的奴役和控制的国家的死敌。
    艾森豪威尔把美国这次对中东地区，首先是对黎巴嫩的武装侵略说成是为了协助一个“遭到外来间接侵略”的小国“维持它的独立”。可是，人们都知道，艾森豪威尔在7月15日出兵中东的第二天，在他向全美广播演说的时候宣称，美国所以要出兵中东是因为“在伊拉克一个组织得十分严密的军事行动推翻了依法组成的政府；”而“黎巴嫩这个小国将近两个月来也一直在进行内战。”艾森豪威尔前后所说的这些理由，不是完全矛盾了吗？既然美国认为伊拉克的新政府不是合法的，而被推翻的费萨尔王朝才是合法的政府，那末，为什么现在美国却不得不宣布承认伊拉克新政府呢？既然美国对于“黎巴嫩这个小国”表示“一贯”尊重，为什么竟然粗暴地干涉它的内政呢？并且谁都知道，在美国军队侵占黎巴嫩以前，黎巴嫩并没有遭受到什么艾森豪威尔所说的那种“外来间接侵略”，它的独立也没有受到什么外力的威胁，这一点已为联合国观察团前后公布的两次报告一再地证明了。那里存在的只是黎巴嫩的反对派反对美英帝国主义的代理人夏蒙集团的斗争，这纯粹是黎巴嫩的内政问题。美国派兵侵占黎巴嫩，这是对黎巴嫩内政的粗暴干涉。把美国对中东的武装干涉行为同它在海地和委内瑞拉的颠复活动对比来看，美国侵略者就更加无法自圆其说了。既然美国口口声声说要维护合法政府，为什么它却千方百计地要颠复海地和委内瑞拉等国的合法政府呢？可见美国对中东的侵略行为同它对海地和委内瑞拉的侵略行为一样，都是对这些小国的独立和主权的侵犯，都是赤裸裸地要重新奴役和继续奴役这些小国的海盗行为。
    无数的事实已经证明，美国一贯地野蛮地践踏小国的独立和主权，要小国政府变成它的百依百顺的奴才。可是现在美国却装着是小国的保护者，口口声声说要维护小国的利益；实际上，美国的真正目的，只是企图以小国为工具，利用所谓维护小国利益做借口，掩盖美国的侵略行为，并且为大国首脑会议的召开设置障碍。但是，侵略者的阴谋手段一定要破产，召开大国首脑会议是全世界人民的共同要求，是当前国际政治的一个不可抗拒的趋势。美国破坏大国首脑会议的伎俩可以休矣。
