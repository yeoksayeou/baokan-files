Title: American Imperialism is the Mortal Enemy of Small Countries

American President Eisenhower, in his letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev on August 1st, tried his best to portray himself as a defender of the rights of small countries, insisting that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-nation summit to discuss the issue of American and British armed aggression in the Middle East was "ignoring the wishes, dignity, and indeed the security of small countries." However, even as Eisenhower was playing with these beautiful words, he was ordering American diplomatic officials to create a rebellion in Haiti to subvert the legitimate government, and the former American military attache to Haiti participated in this rebellion. Not long before this, the United States was also plotting a reactionary coup in Venezuela aimed at restoring a pro-American dictatorial regime. And the day before Eisenhower sent his letter "respecting" small countries, the U.S. government, under the pretext of defending the water supply system of its Guantanamo naval base in Cuba, was preparing to send troops to Cuba for armed intervention. The United States' own aggressive actions completely exposed Eisenhower's hypocritical mask.

Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba are all small countries in Central and South America. The people of Haiti and Venezuela drove out the notorious American agents and dictatorial rulers Magloire and Jim√©nez, respectively, more than a year and half a year ago. The Cuban people are also waging a heroic struggle against the reactionary rule of dictator Batista. The flames of fighting for freedom and breaking free from American enslavement are spreading like wildfire in these countries. The reason why the United States wants to subvert the governments of Haiti and Venezuela is that these governments are supported and endorsed by the people; they are not obedient agents of the United States, and they do not suit the wishes of American aggressors. And the reason why the United States wants to send troops to Cuba, as the New York "Daily News" pointed out, is because it is "colluding with Batista's dictatorial government" and wants to support this unpopular government and suppress the people's resistance. In this respect, it is exactly the same as the U.S. sending troops to Lebanon to support the Chamoun clique. The United States uses the means of inciting rebellion and "coup" conspiracies to subvert the governments supported by the people of other countries, and uses the method of direct armed intervention to support the reactionary ruling groups opposed by the people of other countries. And calling this "respecting" the independence of small countries and "respecting" the existence of legitimate governments, is there any more despicable act or more shameless sophistry than this?

The United States has a hideous and bloody history of instigating riots and creating "coups" in Latin American countries to subvert legitimate governments, even to the point of carrying out open armed aggression. Not to mention the distant past, but only in the ten years from 1948 to 1958 after the war, the United States carried out eleven major subversive activities in Latin America. For example, in 1951, at the instigation of American capitalists who monopolized Bolivia's tin industry, the American ambassador to Bolivia, Weigas, instigated a "coup" that overthrew the Estenssoro government, which was supported by the people. In 1954, the United States launched an armed intervention against Guatemala and subverted the democratic government led by Arbenz. In the same year, Brazilian President Vargas was forced to commit suicide, leaving behind a tearful testament accusing the American aggressors. In addition, the political disturbances that occurred in Peru, El Salvador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Cuba, and other countries were all related to the planning of the United States. The recent events in Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela once again prove that the United States not only "has always" wantonly trampled on and violated the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries, but also "still today" is wantonly trampling on and violating the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries.

During Vice President Nixon's visit to eight South American countries in April and May this year, he was cursed and chased everywhere, which was a manifestation of the Latin American people's extreme resentment of the American aggressors. This time, the United States' subversive conspiracies against Haiti and Venezuela, and its attempts at armed intervention in Cuba, have also been met with stern condemnation from Latin American countries and peoples who are determined to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, as well as from all righteous people in the world. Haitian President Duvalier severely condemned the U.S. plot against the Haitian government as an act of international banditry at a press conference on August 1st.

The U.S. imperialist's gangster behavior of arbitrarily violating the independence and sovereignty of other countries is not limited to Latin America, nor is it limited to small countries. The despicable activities of its sinister hands can also be seen in other parts of the world. People still remember how the United States created "coups" and "filled vacuums" in the Middle Eastern Arab countries. The "coup" that forced Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh to step down in 1953 was masterminded by Henderson, the former American ambassador to Iran, while Colonel McKillan, the head of the U.S. military advisory group, directly served as the commander-in-chief of the riots. In 1957, the United States instigated a "coup" in Jordan and subverted the Nabulsi cabinet, which was pursuing a policy of national independence. Then, the United States carried out armed threats against Syria, and even bought assassins, attempting to assassinate Nasser on the day of the referendum to elect the president of the United Arab Republic. The United States' despicable interference in the struggle of the Indonesian government and people to suppress domestic rebellion has not yet completely stopped. In addition, in many countries in Asia, one can cite disputes and conspiracies created by Americans with all kinds of titles. During this invasion of the Middle East, the United States once again flagrantly disregarded international law and violated the airspace of Austria, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia. All this shows that the United States "has always" and "still today" does not take the independence and sovereignty of other countries seriously. American imperialism is the mortal enemy of all small countries in the world and all countries that are unwilling to accept its enslavement and control.

Eisenhower described this U.S. armed aggression against the Middle East region, first and foremost against Lebanon, as an effort to assist a small country "subjected to external indirect aggression" to "maintain its independence." However, people know that Eisenhower declared on July 15, the day after he sent troops to the Middle East, in his nationwide radio address, that the reason why the United States had to send troops to the Middle East was because "in Iraq a well-organized military action had overthrown the legally constituted government;" and "Lebanon, this small country, has been in civil war for nearly two months." Aren't these reasons Eisenhower said before and after completely contradictory? Since the United States believes that the new government of Iraq is not legitimate and that the overthrown Faisal dynasty is the legitimate government, then why does the United States now have to announce its recognition of the new government of Iraq? Since the United States has expressed "consistent" respect for "Lebanon, this small country," why has it rudely interfered in its internal affairs? And everyone knows that before the American troops occupied Lebanon, Lebanon had not suffered any "external indirect aggression" of the kind Eisenhower described, and its independence was not threatened by any external forces. This has been repeatedly proven by the two reports published by the United Nations observer group. What exists there is only the struggle of the Lebanese opposition against the Chamoun clique, the agent of Anglo-American imperialism, which is purely a matter of Lebanon's internal affairs. The United States sent troops to occupy Lebanon, which is a rude interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Comparing the U.S. armed intervention in the Middle East with its subversive activities in Haiti and Venezuela, the American aggressors are even more unable to justify themselves. Since the United States has repeatedly said that it wants to maintain legitimate governments, why does it try every means to subvert the legitimate governments of Haiti and Venezuela and other countries? It can be seen that the U.S. aggressive behavior in the Middle East, like its aggressive behavior in Haiti and Venezuela, is a violation of the independence and sovereignty of these small countries, and is a naked act of piracy to re-enslave and continue to enslave these small countries.

Countless facts have proven that the United States has consistently and barbarously trampled on the independence and sovereignty of small countries, demanding that the governments of small countries become its obedient slaves. But now the United States pretends to be the protector of small countries, repeatedly saying that it wants to safeguard the interests of small countries. In reality, the true purpose of the United States is simply to attempt to use small countries as tools, use the so-called safeguarding of the interests of small countries as a pretext to cover up American aggressive behavior, and create obstacles to the convening of a summit of major powers. However, the conspiratorial tricks of the aggressors are bound to go bankrupt. The convening of a summit of major powers is the common demand of the people of the world and is an irresistible trend in current international politics. The United States' tricks to undermine the summit of major powers can stop.
