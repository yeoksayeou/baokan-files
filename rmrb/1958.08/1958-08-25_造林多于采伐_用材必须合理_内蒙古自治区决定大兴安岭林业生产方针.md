Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, August 24th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee's forestry work conference, held here from the 7th to the 20th, determined the basic policy for forestry production in the Greater Khingan Range.

　　The conference used the method of highlighting the essentials to review the past forestry production work in the Greater Khingan Range, based on the requirements of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the laws of forest development. The conference considered that: The Greater Khingan Range had achieved great results in logging, exceeding the target set by the first Five-Year Plan by 4.3%, and also completed this year's original plan ahead of schedule and with over-fulfillment. Forest protection and fire prevention work also had achievements, basically protecting the safety of existing forests. However, during the first Five-Year Plan period, only slightly more than 10% of the logged areas were reforested, far behind logging; in recent years, many felled trees have been abandoned on the mountains, and a considerable amount of wood is used as fuel in the forest area every year, resulting in great waste. In addition, branches, bark, sawdust, wood chips, etc., have not been fully and rationally utilized, resulting in a wood utilization rate of only 60%-70%. On the other hand, because basic construction such as timber transportation roads could not keep up with the rapid increase in logging volume, logging was too concentrated, which was not conducive to forest regeneration and soil and water conservation.

    In view of the above situation, the conference criticized the erroneous tendencies of emphasizing logging while neglecting forest regeneration, and neglecting rational use of timber and saving timber. The conference decided on the basic policy of simultaneous logging and regeneration, planting more than cutting, vigorously restoring and developing forests, and rationally utilizing forest resources.

    In order to ensure the realization of this policy, the conference put forward the following specific arrangements: First, resolutely implement simultaneous logging and regeneration. Second, strengthen forest protection to ensure the rapid restoration and development of forests. Third, comprehensively utilize timber and vigorously save timber, and increase the wood utilization rate to more than 90%. Fourth, accelerate basic construction in forest areas, especially the construction of roads. Fifth, strengthen the Party's leadership, mobilize the entire Party and people of Inner Mongolia to run forestry, implement large-scale cooperation between rural areas and forest areas, and accelerate the construction of the Greater Khingan Range.

    Currently, a high tide of regeneration has been set off in the forest area. Twenty-five forestry bureaus have six to seven thousand or even tens of thousands of people composed of employees and their families forming a forest regeneration army, active in various forest farms. At present, the entire forest area has completed more than 2,400 hectares of artificial seedling transplantation and sowing afforestation, and nearly 40,000 hectares of artificial promotion of natural regeneration, completing 75% of the annual larch and Scots pine forest regeneration plan.

　　造林多于采伐　用材必须合理
    内蒙古自治区决定大兴安岭林业生产方针
    据新华社牙克石24日电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会从7日到20日在这里召开的林区工作会议，确定了大兴安岭林业生产的基本方针。
    会议用以虚带实的方法，首先根据党的社会主义建设总路线和森林发展规律的要求，检查了过去大兴安岭的林业生产工作。会议认为：大兴安岭的林业工作，采伐成绩很大，超额4.3％完成了第一个五年计划规定的指标，又提前超额完成了今年的原订计划。护林防火工作也有成绩，基本上保护了现有森林的安全。但是在第一个五年计划期间，采伐的迹地只更新10％强，远远落在采伐的后面；几年来山场上丢弃了许多伐倒木，每年林区作燃料用的木材也不少，造成了很大的浪费。此外，对枝桠、树皮、锯末、碎木等未能加以充分的合理的利用，致使木材利用率仅达60％—70％。另一方面，由于运材道路等基本建设跟不上采伐量猛增的需要，形成采伐过于集中，不利于森林更新和水土保持的现象。
    会议针对上述情况，批判了重视采伐忽视森林更新，以及忽视合理用材与节约木材等错误倾向。会议决定了更新与采伐同时并举，造多于砍，大力恢复与发展森林和合理利用森林资源的基本方针。
    为了保证这一方针的实现，会议提出了以下具体部署：第一，坚决贯彻执行采伐与更新同时并举。第二，加强森林保护工作，保证森林的迅速恢复与发展。第三，综合利用木材和大力节约木材，把木材利用率提高到90％以上。第四，加速林区基本建设，首先是道路的修建。第五，加强党的领导，动员内蒙古全党全民办林业，实行农村、林区大协作，加速建设大兴安岭。
    目前，林区已掀起更新高潮。二十五个林业局每天有六七千以至上万名由职工与家属组成的森林更新大军，活跃在各个林场上。现在全林区已经完成人工移苗和播种造林两千四百多公顷，人工促进天然更新近四万公顷，完成了全年落叶松和樟子松森林更新计划的75％。
