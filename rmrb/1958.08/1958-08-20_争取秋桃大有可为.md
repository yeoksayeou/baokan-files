Current Issues in Agricultural Production: Things to Note

　　Strive for Autumn Cotton Bolls, Great Potential Lies Ahead
    The old saying that "After the Autumn Begins, Everything Stops," which suggests that autumn production is set in stone once the Autumn Begins solar term passes, is clearly completely out of step with today's production requirements. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee held a provincial cotton on-site meeting in Macheng County on August 7th and 8th, criticizing this conservative, backward, and unscientific saying. It proposed to vigorously grasp the late-stage management of cotton fields and to vigorously promote the growth of autumn cotton bolls. This is a very timely move and is also very important for striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year.
    Is cotton production really set in stone after the Autumn Begins? This is clearly not in line with the facts. Taking the cotton in Macheng County, Hubei Province, as an example, this year the county's cotton fields have an average of four thousand several hundred plants per mu. Currently, each plant generally bears only seven or eight large bolls. This year's plan requires an average of about twenty-five bolls per plant, meaning that two-thirds of the cotton bolls have yet to be formed after the Autumn Begins! How can we say that once the Autumn Begins, "Everything Stops"?
    The Hubei Provincial Party Committee proposed at a recent on-site meeting to strengthen the late-stage management of cotton fields, mainly to
  “Vigorously Grasp Autumn Cotton Bolls,” and pointed out that "Striving for Autumn Cotton Bolls, Great Potential Lies Ahead." This is completely correct and fully justified. After the Autumn Begins, cotton still has two to three months of growth. Many cotton bolls in the middle and upper parts of the cotton plant will grow during this period. Last year, Macheng County's average yield of ginned cotton was 100 jin per mu, and the yield of autumn cotton bolls accounted for 50%; Tianmen County had 220,000 mu of cotton fields producing 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and autumn cotton bolls accounted for about 80%. These are all powerful examples of "Striving for Autumn Cotton Bolls, Great Potential Lies Ahead." For cotton fields with 5,000 plants per mu, each additional autumn cotton boll per plant can increase the yield of seed cotton by 50 jin per mu. Therefore, doing a good job in late-stage management and striving to form more autumn cotton bolls is indeed a crucial key to ensuring the realization of the cotton leap forward and increased production plan. Of course, when we strive to form more autumn cotton bolls, we mean the cotton bolls that have time to mature, not late cotton bolls that will not have time to mature regardless of seasonal conditions.
    Grasp autumn cotton bolls, protect the fu cotton bolls, and form large cotton bolls, these are the main goals to strive for in the late-stage management of cotton fields. Some people doubt: if we are required to protect fu cotton bolls and form large cotton bolls, can we still vigorously grasp autumn cotton bolls? This is also a conservative view. If we say that in the past, because cotton fields lacked fertility and management was not strong, we could only use the method of early topping to limit the formation of bolls in the upper part, so as to reduce the shedding of middle and lower cotton bolls and increase the weight of the cotton bolls, then this year our fertilization conditions and management techniques are no longer the same as in the past, and we are fully capable of adopting more active methods to take both into account.
    "After the Autumn Begins, Everything Stops"; after the Autumn Begins, cotton fields dare not be fertilized, dare not be irrigated, and dare not be cultivated and weeded; after the Autumn Begins, they "pick everything together," topping regardless of the specific conditions of the cotton field and seasonal conditions. These practices, which do not take objective possibilities into account and simply follow old habits, should be thoroughly changed.

### 争取秋桃大有可为

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

　　争取秋桃大有可为
    “立了秋，万事休”这种认为立秋一过，秋季生产便已定局的旧说法，显然是完全不符合今天的生产要求了。湖北省委8月7日8日两天在麻城县召开了一个全省棉花现场会，批判了这种保守落后的不科学的说法，提出要狠狠地抓棉田后期管理，要大搞秋桃。这是抓得很适时的，对于争取今年棉花的大丰收，也是很重要的做法。
    立秋过后，棉花生产就真的定局了吗？这显然不符合事实。就拿湖北省麻城县的棉花来说，今年全县的棉田平均每亩四千几百株，目前一般每株只结了七、八个大桃，今年的规划平均每株要求结桃二十五个左右，还有三分之二的棉桃要在立秋以后结起来！怎能说立了秋便“万事休”呢？
    湖北省委在最近一次现场会上提出加强棉田后期管理，主要是要
  “大抓秋桃”，并且指出“争取秋桃，大有可为”，这是完全正确的，也是完全有根据的。立秋以后，棉花还有二、三个月的生长期，棉株中部、上部许多棉桃都是要在这个期间长成的。麻城县去年全县平均亩产皮棉一百斤，秋桃的产量占50％；天门县去年有二十二万亩百斤皮棉田，秋桃约占80％。这些都是“争取秋桃，大有可为”的有力的例证。每亩五千株的棉田，只要每株增加一个秋桃，每亩就可增加五十斤籽棉的产量。因之，好好地抓一下后期管理，力争多结一些秋桃，对保证实现棉花跃进增产的规划，确是极重要的关键。当然，我们争取多结一些秋桃，是指来得及成熟的棉桃，而不是不顾季节条件而搞来不及成熟的晚桃。
    抓秋桃，保伏桃，结大桃，这是棉田后期管理主要争取的目标。有人怀疑：既要求保伏桃、结大桃，是否还能多抓秋桃呢？这也是保守的看法。如果说往年因为棉田肥力不足，管理工作不强，只有用早打顶限制上部结桃的办法，来减少中下部棉桃的脱落和增加棉铃的重量，那末，今年我们的施肥条件、管理技术都不再是往年那样了，我们完全有条件采取更积极的办法来兼顾的。
    “立了秋，万事休”；立了秋，棉田就不敢施肥，就不敢灌溉，就不中耕除草；立了秋，就“大小一齐揪”，不问棉田的具体情况和季节条件一律打顶，这些不顾客观的可能条件，一味按旧习惯办事的作法，是应该彻底加以改变了。
