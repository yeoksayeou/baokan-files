Xinhua News Agency, Mumbai, August 10th: Kotnis's son, Yinhua, and his mother, Guo Qinglan, the wife and son of the Indian medical captain Kotnis, who contributed his life to the Chinese people's national liberation war, arrived here on the 8th to visit the late Kotnis's elderly mother and family.

Dr. Kotnis left here with the Indian Medical Team twenty years ago to go to China to help the people of the liberated areas in the Anti-Japanese War. During the enemy's mopping-up operations, Kotnis worked day and night to treat wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, and died due to overwork and illness. The people of Mumbai often proudly call Kotnis an "Indian Hero" and an "Example of Sino-Indian Friendship."

Kotnis's entire family, representatives from the Mumbai India-China Friendship Association, and Chinese Consul General Zhang Jiping went to the airport to welcome them and presented them with garlands. Kotnis's seventy-year-old mother stood at the door with tears of happiness in her eyes and placed a red auspicious mark on Yinhua's forehead.

Kotnis's siblings told Yinhua and Guo Qinglan stories from Kotnis's childhood and showed them letters Kotnis had written home from the liberated areas. Guo Qinglan and Yinhua told the family about Kotnis's work during his lifetime and his contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, as well as the deep concern of Chinese leaders for Kotnis and Yinhua. They said that Kotnis expressed his hope before his death that the struggles of the Indian and Chinese people would be victorious, and that their friendship would be strengthened.

At a gathering held by Zhang Jiping tonight for Yinhua and Guo Qinglan, many well-known citizens, including former Governor of Mumbai State, Bark Vasa, had enthusiastic conversations with them. Former Mayor of Mumbai, Kadar, told reporters that Kotnis "wrote a page in the history of Sino-Indian friendship with his life and blood, and the people will never forget him." The Mumbai India-China Friendship Association named the venue for this year's Mumbai meeting of the India-China Friendship Association as Kotnis Town. Sharma, a member of the Mumbai India-China Friendship Association, said that Kotnis reminds people not only of the current friendly relations between India and China, but also of the past relations.

　　探视印度英雄的故乡和亲人
　　柯棣华的妻儿访问孟买
    新华社孟买10日电　在中国人民的民族解放战争中贡献了自己生命的印度医疗队长柯棣华的儿子印华同他的母亲郭庆兰，8日到这里来访问已故的柯棣华的老母亲和家人。
    柯棣华博士二十年前同印度医疗队离开这里前往中国帮助解放区的人民进行抗日战争。在敌人的扫荡战中柯棣华日夜为八路军受伤的士兵进行治疗，由于劳累过度和疾病而逝世。孟买人民常常骄傲地称柯棣华为“印度英雄”和“印中友谊的典范”。
    柯棣华的全家、孟买印中友好协会的代表和中国总领事张吉平都到机场去欢迎他们，并且给他们带上了花环。柯棣华七十岁的老母亲在家门口眼中含着幸福的眼泪在印华的前额上点上了红色的吉祥痣。
    柯棣华的兄弟姊妹对印华和郭庆兰讲述了柯棣华童年时的故事，并且拿出柯棣华从解放区写回家的信给他们看。郭庆兰和印华向全家人讲述了柯棣华生前进行工作的情况和对中国人民的解放事业所作的贡献，以及中国领袖对柯棣华和印华的深切关怀。他们说，柯棣华临死时曾表示希望印度人民和中国人民所进行的斗争获得胜利，并加强他们之间的友谊。
    在张吉平今天晚上为印华和郭庆兰举行的聚会上，许多知名的市民其中包括孟买邦前邦长巴克伐萨，和他们进行了热情的谈话。前孟买市长卡达尔对记者说，柯棣华“用生命和鲜血写下了印中友谊历史中的一页，人民永远不会忘记他”。孟买印中友好协会将印中友好协会今年在孟买举行会议的会址命名为柯棣华镇。孟买印中友好协会委员夏尔马说，柯棣华使人们不仅想起了印度和中国目前的友好关系，并且还想起了过去的关系。
