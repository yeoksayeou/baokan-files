Our six hundred million people are engaged in the great socialist construction with unprecedented scale and speed, and all cultural and artistic work is leaping forward again and again, proactively and actively serving socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Party, the 160,000 to 170,000 professional opera workers and the vast number of amateur opera workers across the country are also staging modern dramas and reorganizing excellent traditional dramas with high revolutionary enthusiasm and energy, coordinating with current tasks, going to the countryside, factories, and troops, and performing and promoting in theaters, squares, and streets. At present, most of the modern dramas are performed by hundreds of thousands of amateur troupes and many professional troupes in special districts and counties. In the past, there were fewer opera troupes in large and medium-sized cities that staged modern dramas, but since this spring, modern dramas have also increased significantly. The quality of modern dramas is generally higher than in the past. Many modern dramas reflect current life struggles in a timely manner, use and develop excellent traditional art, and strive to educate the audience with socialist and communist ideas, inspiring their revolutionary will and labor enthusiasm. They have reached a high level in terms of ideology, artistry, and performance skills. Modern dramas have further demonstrated their vigorous vitality and combat role, and are welcomed by the broad masses of the audience.

With the widespread and in-depth development of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, the objective need and trend to further develop new operas with socialist content seem to be increasingly obvious. The great era needs to be reflected in opera works, and the builders of the great socialist and communist society—the workers, peasants, and soldiers with the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to do—must become the masters of literary and artistic works and also occupy an important position on the opera stage; opera has a large team and a large audience, and should play a greater role in promoting and implementing the general line; opera art should have new developments in the new era, which requires vigorously developing new operas with socialist content. Any art form should be able to express historical life and modern life, otherwise its development will be greatly limited. There will be some contradictions and difficulties in using traditional opera forms to express the life of modern people, which need to be overcome. Some old routines need to be broken through, and at the beginning, the content and form may not be very harmonious. Experience has proven that this is inevitable, but it can be gradually resolved. Judging from this joint performance of modern dramas, some genres and dramas have been solved very well. It has always been thought that Peking opera is difficult to express modern life. Now it seems that appropriate efforts can also be made in this regard. Opera has already achieved new achievements in expressing modern life content. Expressing modern life is the direction of future opera work.

While vigorously developing modern dramas, we must not despise or exclude excellent traditional dramas. Many excellent traditional dramas reflect the wishes of the working people in history, sing the praises of their excellent moral qualities, and have rich and complete artistic performance skills and techniques, which are loved by the people. We must give full play to their role and make the past serve the present. In the past few years, great achievements have been made in excavating, sorting out, and improving traditional dramas. From the recent joint performance of modern dramas, it can be seen that learning and inheriting tradition is of great significance for the development of modern dramas. It is wrong to despise traditional dramas, but it is also wrong not to develop and innovate traditional dramas.

There have been many experiences in opera reform in the past nine years. First of all, in the development of opera traditional dramas, a large number of dramas have been sorted out and processed, and the beneficial parts have been developed, and the harmful parts have been gradually eliminated, making the opera face a new look. The achievements are great. However, in the development of modern dramas, there have been some twists and turns. In the first few years after the national liberation, under the promotion of various movements, a climax of staging modern dramas appeared across the country. However, in the process of development, due to the failure to lead modern dramas in a timely manner to consolidate and improve them, and on the other hand, due to despising tradition and excluding traditional dramas, the opera reform work had rough phenomena, which also affected the development of my country's opera. The Party promptly corrected the rough tendencies, and emphasized the excavation, sorting out and staging of excellent traditional dramas, and learning traditional opera art and skills, which is completely correct, and also provides favorable conditions for today's modern drama creation. However, for a considerable period of time, not enough emphasis was placed on modern dramas, and promotion was not strong enough. In particular, many people had too strict requirements for modern dramas, with many rules and regulations, pouring cold water on new things, and hurting the enthusiasm for creating and performing modern dramas. A conservative tendency appeared in the opera reform work, and thus came a low tide of modern dramas. Now, under the impetus of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, a new upsurge of staging modern dramas has emerged again. This upsurge has significant differences compared with the previous one. Now we have more favorable conditions for developing new socialist operas. That is: the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of professional and amateur opera workers is unprecedentedly high, and their infinite creativity is being liberated from the shackles of superstitious thoughts, mysterious views, and outdated rules and regulations; in the struggle to change the historical face of China, the spiritual outlook of the working people is undergoing unprecedented changes, and they increasingly need and welcome modern dramas, and constantly put forward new requirements for traditional dramas; Party and government leaders at all levels are paying close attention to opera work, and opera has become a powerful weapon for promoting socialist construction and carrying out cultural revolution. Cultural administrative leading departments and troupes at all levels have gained rich experience in inheriting tradition and carrying out innovation and creation, and the leading backbone of the troupes is also strengthening and improving. In the past, these favorable conditions were not fully available. The current general situation is that, no matter from the needs of socialist construction, from the needs of the audience, or from the needs of the development of opera art itself, opera work must have a Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party and under the shining of the general line, vigorously developing new socialist opera has become fully possible. The Ministry of Culture recently held a "Symposium on Opera Representing Modern Life," which clarified that "vigorously implement the general line in opera work, use politics to lead art, let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new; take modern dramas as the key link to promote the overall Great Leap Forward of opera work, while vigorously developing modern dramas, continue to earnestly excavate and sort out traditional dramas, and stage new historical dramas; on the basis of fully developing excellent traditional art, create new socialist opera, powerfully serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and serve socialist revolution and socialist construction." It put forward the task of "going all out, breaking superstitions, fighting hard for three years, and striving to make the proportion of modern dramas reach 20% to 50% in the repertoire of most opera genres and troupes respectively. Strive to have a large number of modern dramas with high ideological, artistic, and performance skills within three to five years, and become excellent repertoire," which timely pointed out the goals of opera work in a certain period, marking that opera work has embarked on a new stage of developing new socialist opera.

To achieve the above guidelines and tasks, we must rely on the leadership of local party committees, adhere to the working methods of putting politics in command and following the mass line, and continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads and two methods in opera work. At present, we must first resolutely fight against the erroneous ideas of art for art's sake, opera for opera's sake, mystifying and specializing opera, emphasizing the past and belittling the present, and superstition in outdated rules and regulations, as well as the right-leaning conservative ideas of being content with the middle, and not daring to leap forward; at the same time, we must also prevent the rough phenomena of despising and excluding excellent traditional dramas. We must walk on two legs, vigorously developing modern dramas and actively staging excellent traditional dramas. At the same time, we must distinguish between primary and secondary and recognize that developing modern dramas is the main direction of future opera work. We must affirm achievements, go all out, break superstitions, and give full play to the infinite creativity of the broad masses, instead of crawling slowly and coldly. Under the leadership of local party committees, we must launch a mass movement to create modern dramas, advocate the combination of experts and the masses, the combination of individuals and collectives, the combination of professional and amateur, the combination of troupes and audiences and authors, and the combination of large, medium, and small dramas. We must also train creative backbones, exchange scripts and creative experiences, so that millions of new scripts can be staged by hundreds of thousands of troupes in a timely manner, and a large number of modern dramas will continuously improve their quality and reach a high level. Professional opera workers must go deep into the workers, peasants and soldiers and actual struggle, and transform their thinking. All troupes must frequently go to the countryside, factories, and troops to tour and perform. In terms of performance, we advocate diligent study and hard practice, and quickly master excellent traditional techniques. We must also dare to innovate and create, open up new paths, and surpass our predecessors.

Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line, let us be full of confidence and courage, and with indomitable revolutionary vigor and spirit of inquiry, forge ahead bravely, leap forward again and again, so that the new socialist opera will rapidly grow and become more prosperous!

    戏曲工作者应该为表现现代生活而努力
    我国六亿人民正以史无前例的巨大规模和速度进行伟大的社会主义建设，一切文化艺术工作都在跃进再跃进，主动地积极地为社会主义建设服务。全国十六、七万职业的戏曲工作者和广大的业余戏曲工作者，在党的领导下，也正以高涨的革命热情和干劲，编演现代剧目，整理优秀的传统剧目，配合当前任务，下乡下厂下部队和在剧场、广场、街头进行演出和宣传。现在几十万个业余剧团和很多专区、县的职业剧团演的大部分是现代剧目，以前大、中城市的戏曲剧团上演现代剧目少一些，但从今春起，现代剧目也显著地增多了。现代剧目的质量一般较过去为高，很多现代剧目及时反映了当前的生活斗争，运用和发展优秀的传统艺术，努力地以社会主义、共产主义思想教育观众，鼓舞他们的革命斗志和劳动热情，在思想性、艺术性和表演技巧上都达到了较高的水平。现代剧目已进一步表现出它的旺盛的生命力和战斗作用，受到广大观众的欢迎。
    随着技术革命和文化革命普遍而深入地展开，进一步大力发展社会主义内容的新戏曲的客观需要和趋势看来是越来越明显了。伟大的时代需要在戏曲作品中得到反映，伟大的社会主义、共产主义社会的建设者——具有敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的共产主义风格的工农兵群众要成为文艺作品的主人公，也要在戏曲舞台占重要地位；戏曲拥有庞大的队伍和广大的观众，应该在宣传和贯彻总路线上起更大的作用；戏曲艺术在新的时代应该有新的发展，这就要大力发展社会主义内容的新戏曲。任何一种艺术形式都应当既能表现历史生活，又能够表现现代生活，否则它的发展就会受到很大的限制。运用传统的戏曲形式来表现现代人民的生活，会有一些矛盾和困难，需要克服。有些旧的程式需要突破，在开始的时候，内容和形式之间可能还不很和谐。经验证明，这是难免的，但也是完全可以逐步解决的。从这次现代剧目联合公演看来，有些剧种和剧目已经解决得很好，向来认为京剧是很难表现现代生活的，现在看来，这方面也可以作适当的努力。戏曲表现现代生活内容已经有了新的成就。表现现代生活是今后戏曲工作的发展方向。
    我们大力发展现代剧目，但决不能轻视和排斥优秀的传统剧目。很多优秀传统剧目反映了历史上劳动人民的愿望，歌颂了他们优良的道德品质，并且具有丰富、完整的艺术表演技巧和技术，这都是人民所喜爱的，我们必须充分发挥它们的作用，使古为今用。几年来，发掘、整理、提高传统剧目是有很大成绩的，从最近现代剧目联合公演中看到了学习和继承传统对于发展现代剧目具有重大意义。轻视传统剧目是错误的，但对传统剧目不加发展革新也是错误的。
    九年来的戏曲改革是有很多经验的。首先是在发展戏曲传统剧目上，大量剧目已经经过了整理加工，其中有益的部分得到了发展，有害的部分被逐渐消除，使戏曲面貌为之一新，成绩很大。但在发展现代剧目方面却经过了一些曲折。在全国解放后的头几年，在历次运动的推动下，全国曾出现过上演现代剧目的高潮，但在发展过程中，由于没有及时地对现代剧目加以领导，使之巩固提高，而另外一方面由于轻视传统，排斥传统剧目，致使戏曲改革工作发生了粗暴现象，因而也影响了我国戏曲的发展。党及时地纠正了粗暴倾向，强调了发掘整理和上演优良传统剧目，学习传统的戏曲艺术和技巧，这是完全正确的，也给今天现代剧目的创造提供了有利的条件。但是，在相当长的时期内，对现代剧目强调不够，提倡不力，特别是有不少人对现代剧目要求过严，清规戒律很多，对新生事物泼冷水，伤害了创作与演出现代剧目的积极性，在戏曲改革工作中出现了保守倾向，这样就来了个现代剧目的低潮。现在在全国大跃进的形势的带动下又出现了上演现代剧目的新高潮。这次高潮与前次相比有显著的不同点。现在已经具备了发展社会主义新戏曲的更有利的条件，这就是：广大职业的和业余的戏曲工作者的革命热情空前高涨，他们的无限的创造力正在从迷信思想、神秘观点和陈规陋习的束缚中解放出来；在改变中国历史面貌的斗争中劳动人民的精神面貌正在发生前所未有的变化，他们越来越需要和欢迎现代剧目，对传统剧目也不断提出了新的要求；各级党政领导对戏曲工作抓的很紧，戏曲已成为推动社会主义建设，进行文化革命的强大的武器。各级文化行政领导部门和剧团，对于继承传统和进行革新创造已经取得了丰富的经验，剧团的领导骨干也在加强和提高。过去是不完全具备这些有利条件的。目前总的形势是，不论从社会主义建设的需要，从观众的需要，从戏曲艺术本身的发展的需要来看，戏曲工作都必须来一个大跃进，在党的领导下，在总路线照耀下，大力发展社会主义的新戏曲，已经有了充分的可能。文化部最近召开了“戏曲表现现代生活座谈会”，明确了“在戏曲工作中大力贯彻执行总路线，以政治带动艺术，百花齐放、推陈出新；以现代剧目为纲，推动戏曲工作的全面大跃进，在大力发展现代剧目的同时，继续认真发掘和整理传统剧目，并排演新历史剧目；在充分发扬优秀传统艺术的基础上，创造社会主义的新戏曲，有力地为工农兵服务，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务”的方针，提出了“鼓足干劲，破除迷信，苦战三年，争取在大多数剧种和剧团的上演剧目中，现代剧目的比例分别达到20％至50％。争取在三、五年内有大批的现代剧目具有高度的思想性、艺术性和表演技巧，成为优秀的保留剧目”的任务，这就十分及时地指出了戏曲工作在一定时期的奋斗目标，标志着戏曲工作走上了发展社会主义的新戏曲的新阶段。
    实现以上的方针和任务，必须依靠各地党委的领导，坚持政治挂帅和群众路线的工作方法，继续进行戏曲工作中的两条道路和两种方法的斗争。目前必须首先同为艺术而艺术，为戏曲而戏曲，把戏曲神秘化、特殊化，厚古薄今，迷信陈规陋习等错误思想和甘居中游，不敢跃进的右倾保守思想，进行坚决的斗争；同时也要防止轻视和排斥优秀传统剧目的粗暴现象。必须两条腿走路，既要大力发展现代剧目，又要积极上演优秀的传统剧目，同时，也必须区分主次先后，明确认识发展现代剧目是今后戏曲工作发展的主要方向。必须肯定成绩，鼓足干劲，破除迷信，充分发挥广大群众的无穷的创造力，而不是慢慢腾腾、冷冷清清地爬行。要在各地党委领导下，发动群众性的现代剧目创作运动，提倡专家与群众结合，个人与集体结合，专业与业余结合，剧团与观众、作者结合，大、中、小型剧目结合，并且要训练创作骨干，交流剧本和创作经验，使千百万个新剧本及时为几十万个剧团所演出，大批的现代剧目不断提高质量，使之具有高度的水平。专业戏曲工作者要深入工农兵群众和实际斗争，改造自己的思想。所有剧团都必须经常下乡下厂下部队巡回演出，在表演方面，提倡勤学苦练，尽快地掌握优秀的传统技术，并要敢于革新创造，开辟新路，超过前人。
    让我们在党的领导下，在总路线光辉照耀下，充满信心和勇气，以百折不挠的革命干劲和钻劲，勇往直前，跃进再跃进，使社会主义新戏曲迅速壮大，更加繁荣！
