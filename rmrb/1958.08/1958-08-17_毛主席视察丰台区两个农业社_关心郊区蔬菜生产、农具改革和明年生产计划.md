Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: Just before returning to Beijing City from Tianjin on the evening of August 13th, Chairman Mao, disregarding the fatigue of his journey, inspected two agricultural production cooperatives in the Fengtai District in the southwestern suburbs of Beijing. Accompanying the Chairman on the inspection were Zhao Fan, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Xian, Deputy Director, Wang Jingming, First Secretary of the Fengtai District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Zongping, Secretary of the Secretariat.

Chairman Mao first arrived at the Hongshiyue (October Revolution) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuegezhuang Township, Fengtai District. This area is one of the vegetable production bases in the suburbs of Beijing. The cooperative has over 9,000 mu of land, of which more than 7,000 mu are vegetable fields. The farmers have many years of vegetable growing experience. After meeting with the township and cooperative cadres who came to welcome him, Chairman Mao did not even have a sip of water before briskly walking along the repaired field road towards the cabbage experimental plot of the youth production team.

Chairman Mao stopped next to a vegetable field where cabbage had already sprouted. Tian Deshun, the leader of the youth production team, reported to the Chairman: Our 1.4 mu of land is a high-yield experimental field for cabbage. After harvesting the previous crop, we deep-plowed to a depth of two chi (approximately 2/3 of a meter), applied 210,000 jin (105 tons) of mixed fertilizer in layers, and also applied 1,700 jin (850 kg) of "tiao huo" (a fertilizer mixed from cattle hooves, sheep horns, fur, etc.). We planted the cabbage with alternate rows of spinach and dense planting, increasing the density from 2,000 plants per mu in the past to more than 5,500 plants, which can produce 1.2 million jin (600 tons). Upon hearing this, Chairman Mao asked: 1.2 million jin? Is this the plan! Tian Deshun said: It is the planned target, and we are confident that we can achieve it. The Chairman smiled approvingly, looked at him, gestured with his hand, and asked very concernedly: When will the vegetables grow up? Wang Jingming, the District Committee Secretary, replied: The vegetables will grow in October.

Chairman Mao asked everyone: Your vegetable cooperative probably doesn't grow enough grain for your own consumption! Wang Huandiao, the Township Party Secretary, replied: With the great leap forward in production, we will not only produce more vegetables, but also more grain. We have widely promoted the three-crop intercropping method of kidney beans, corn, and cabbage. This year, we will be able to produce enough grain for our own consumption, and next year we will be able to sell more than 3 million jin (1,500 tons) of surplus grain to the state!

Amidst the cheers and applause of the cooperative members, the Chairman drove to the Xiaotun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District.

In the car, the conversation about vegetables continued. The Chairman first asked District Committee Secretary Wang Jingming: How many jin of vegetables does one mu produce? Wang Jingming replied, 10,000 jin last year, 20,000 jin this year, and 30,000 jin next year. Last year, Fengtai District supplied more than 560 million jin (280,000 tons) of vegetables to the capital, and this year it is expected that 1.4 billion jin (700,000 tons) of vegetables will be on the market. At this time, the Chairman asked a question: What happens when there are too many vegetables? Wang Jingming said: When there are too many vegetables, the price will be cheaper. This year's vegetable prices are lower than last year's, and consumers are very happy. At the same time, because the output is higher, the income of farmers will not only not decrease, but also increase, and the farmers are also very happy. In addition, we are also preparing to further adopt methods of staggered planting and staged marketing to solve the contradiction of excessive vegetables in the peak season and insufficient supply in the off-season. Some vegetables can be preserved through the winter and can also be supplied to other cities and construction sites. Hearing this, Chairman Mao smiled and nodded.

When Chairman Mao got out of the car at the Xiaotun Agricultural Production Cooperative, the sun was about to set. Chairman Mao and the township and cooperative cadres walked together to the edge of the corn experimental field of the fourth team. Zhang Zhi, the leader of the production team that cultivated this corn, reported to the Chairman: In addition to harvesting kidney beans in the previous crop and planting cabbage in the next crop, this triple-crop corn can also produce 2,000 jin (1 ton) of corn per mu. The Chairman asked, "How many jin of wheat did you harvest this year!" Tian Qi, the director of the cooperative, said: 398 jin (199 kg), and we plan to produce 2,000 jin (1 ton) per mu next year. Hearing this, the Chairman stopped and asked, "2,000 jin, are you confident?" Tian Qi said: We are confident. Then, the Chairman asked about the measures for producing 2,000 jin of wheat: how many chi (approximately 1/3 meter) deep did they plow, how much fertilizer was applied per mu, how dense was the planting, and what kind of seeds were used. The Chairman also paid special attention to the reform of agricultural tools, asking how many reformed agricultural tools there were and whether shoulder carrying was still used during the harvest. Cooperative Director Tian Qi explained the various measures to guarantee a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and then excitedly reported to Chairman Mao: We use rubber-tired carts for transportation in our cooperative, and all 240-plus carts have been converted to ball bearings. The cooperative also has ten gas engines and electric motors, and the water pumping tools are all electrified and mechanized. The cooperative has two tractors and two cars, and we will buy two more tractors and ten more cars after the autumn harvest. By this time, it was already dark, and everyone urged the Chairman to rest after a long day. However, upon hearing that there were still many cooperative members deep-plowing the land ahead, the Chairman eagerly wanted to see it.

When Chairman Mao arrived at the edge of the field, people cheered. Chairman Mao repeatedly waved his hand in response before everyone quieted down. Although it was already dark, Chairman Mao still stood on the edge of the field that had been plowed two chi (approximately 2/3 of a meter) deep and asked in detail about the deep plowing. Finally, he asked Tian Qi how much labor was required to plow one mu using this method. Tian Qi said: Forty to fifty workdays. The Chairman asked him: Will all the land for planting wheat next year be deep-plowed? Tian Qi said: There are many people in the cooperative, and we are even more motivated by learning the general line. Next year, we will deep-plow every piece of land. If we can't finish it, we will work at night. Hearing "work at night," Chairman Mao smiled. He said loudly to the cooperative members around him: It's getting dark, shouldn't you go home from work? Everyone said in unison: It's not dark yet, we still have to work for a while.

Chairman Mao was about to leave, and everyone followed closely behind with reluctance. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party!" erupted. The director of the cooperative said loudly on behalf of everyone: We must realize the leap forward plan and report the good news to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook hands with the cooperative members who kept coming forward, waved his hand repeatedly, and then got into the car.

After Chairman Mao left, the fields of the Hongshiyue Cooperative were lit up with lights. A night battle army of more than 1,300 people launched an intense battle. People eagerly determined to repay Chairman Mao's concern with practical actions.

　　毛主席视察丰台区两个农业社
　　关心郊区蔬菜生产、农具改革和明年生产计划
    新华社16日讯　8月13日傍晚，毛主席在从天津回到北京城里的前一刻，不顾旅途的劳顿，视察了北京西南郊丰台区的两个农业生产合作社。陪同主席前往视察的有中共北京市委农村工作部部长赵凡、副部长王宪和中共丰台区委第一书记王景铭、书记处书记张宗平。
    毛主席首先来到了丰台区岳各庄乡红十月农业生产合作社。这一带是北京郊区生产蔬菜的基地之一，这个社九千多亩土地，有七千多亩都是菜地，农民们有多年的种菜经验。毛主席在和前来欢迎的乡社干部见面后，连口水也没有喝，就沿着修整的田间大道，健步向青年生产队的大白菜试验地走去。
    在一块白菜已经出土的菜地旁边，毛主席站住了。青年生产队长田德顺向主席汇报说：我们这一亩四分地是大白菜高额丰产试验田，收了上茬菜，深耕二尺，分层施了二十一万斤混合肥，还上了一千七百斤“条货”（就是牛蹄羊角皮毛等混合起来的肥料），用大白菜和菠菜隔畦间作的办法种，一亩从过去的两千来棵密植到五千五百多棵，能产一百二十万斤。毛主席听到这里，问道：一百二十万斤？这是计划罗！田德顺说：是计划指标，我们有信心达到。主席赞许地微笑着，看了看他，用手比着，非常关切的问道：什么时候菜才能长起来呢？区委书记王景铭回答说：十月里菜就长起来了。
    毛主席问大家：你们这个菜社，自己种的粮食还不够吃吧！乡党委书记王焕雕回答说：生产大跃进了，我们不仅要多生产蔬菜，还要多打粮食，我们这儿普遍推广了芸豆、玉米、大白菜三茬交叉套作的三大季种植法。今年我们自己的粮食就能够吃了，明年还能向国家卖三百多万斤余粮呢！
    在社员的欢呼声和掌声中，主席乘车驶往丰台区小屯农业生产合作社。
    在车上，关于蔬菜的谈话还在继续着。主席先问区委书记王景铭：一亩菜产多少斤？王景铭回答说，去年一万斤，今年两万斤，明年能到三万斤。去年，丰台区供应给首都五亿六千多万斤菜，今年预计将有十四亿斤蔬菜上市。这时，主席提了一个问题：菜多了怎么办呢？王景铭说：菜多了价钱便宜些，今年菜价就比去年低一些，消费者都挺高兴；同时，因为产量高了，农民的收入不仅不会减少，还会增加，农民也很高兴。另外，我们还准备进一步采取排开种、分期上市的办法解决旺季蔬菜过剩、淡季供不应求的矛盾，有些菜可以保存过冬，还可以供应其他城市和建设工地的需要。听到这里，毛主席笑着点了点头。
    毛主席在小屯农业生产合作社下车时，太阳快要落山了。毛主席和乡社干部一起走到四队玉米试验田的地边。栽培这块玉米的生产组长张志向主席汇报说：这块三大季玉米，除了上茬收了芸豆，下茬种大白菜以外，每亩还能产两千斤玉米。主席问：“今年你们的小麦打多少斤！”社主任田岐说：三百九十八斤，明年计划每亩产两千斤。主席听到这里停下来，问：“两千斤，有把握吗？”田岐说：有把握。接着，主席就问起打两千斤小麦的措施：深翻几尺，每亩地上多少肥料，密植使多少种籽，使什么样的种籽。主席还特别关心农具改革，问起有多少改革的农具，收庄稼时还有没有肩挑。社主任田岐把保证亩产千斤的各项措施说了一遍，随后兴奋地向毛主席汇报说：我们社里运输都用胶轮大车，二百四十多辆大车都滚珠轴承化了，社里还有十台煤气机和电动机，抽水工具都电气化和机械化了。社里有两台拖拉机和两辆汽车，秋后还要买两台拖拉机和十辆汽车。这时，天已经黑下来了，大家都劝主席说：累了一天该休息了。但是，主席听说前边还有不少社员在深翻土地，就兴致勃勃地要去看一看。
    毛主席到了地边，人们欢呼着，毛主席一再挥手致意，大家才静下来。虽然天已经黑了，毛主席还站到已经翻下二尺深的地边，详细地问了深翻地的情况。最后，他问田岐，用这种方法翻地，一亩地要多少工？田岐说：四五十个工。主席问他：明年种小麦的地都深翻吗？田岐说：社里人多，学了总路线干劲更足，明年我们块块地都要深翻，翻不过来，我们就夜战。听到“夜战”，毛主席笑了，他大声向周围的社员说：天黑了，该收工回家了吧？大伙齐声说：不算黑，还得干一会儿。
    毛主席要走了，大伙依依不舍地紧紧跟随在后边，“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”的欢呼声沸腾起来。社主任代表大家高声地说：我们一定要实现跃进计划向毛主席报喜。毛主席和不断涌过来的社员握手，一再挥手致意后，才坐进车去。
    毛主席走后，红十月社的地里一片灯火，一千三百多人组成的夜战大军，展开了一场紧张的战斗。人们迫不及待地决心以实际行动来报答毛主席的关怀。
