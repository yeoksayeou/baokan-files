Between Leaders and the Led
　　Lin Zhong

　　Cadres in communes and teams are busy all day long, but still, many things cannot be handled; while the commune members, besides production labor, don't care about anything and wait for the cadres to manage everything. This is a contradiction that many agricultural cooperatives have not yet resolved. The practice of Qingcheng Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang, in absorbing most of its members to participate in various management tasks seems to be an effective measure to solve this contradiction. Having members manage various major crops in groups has effectively reversed the phenomenon of some members grabbing work points regardless of quality. Having a finance team composed of members assist in managing the cooperative's farm tools has resulted in the farm tools being managed in an orderly manner, eliminating and reducing the phenomenon of farm tool loss. People might think that work like political mobilization must be done by cadres. But in fact, political mobilization teams organized by members can also do a lot of things and play a big role. They help members read newspapers and spread advanced experiences from various places. This alone can make the cooperative's work progress faster.

　　The contradiction between leaders and the led is an important aspect of internal contradictions among the people. Here, this contradiction is effectively eliminated. When members participate in some management work themselves, they will realize the difficulties of being a cadre and recognize that making excessive demands on cadres is unrealistic and useless. At the same time, they will actively think of various ways to solve the difficult problems that a few cadres cannot solve, greatly accelerating the improvement and progress of the work. When the members feel that they are not only "working hands" but also cadres and masters of the cooperative, a new relationship between leaders and the led emerges: it is not that a few people manage the majority of people and the affairs of the whole cooperative, but that the majority of people manage their own affairs, which are also the affairs of the whole cooperative; each member is a follower in one aspect, but an organizer and leader in another; they are all followers and all leaders. The clear boundary between leaders and the led is lost, and both concepts have new meanings.

　　It was unimaginable in the old days for the majority of the masses to participate in leadership and management. But in the socialist countryside, this is an inevitable product. It will appear in all agricultural cooperatives sooner or later because there are no exploiters and exploited with fundamental conflicts of interest here. Once people discover that this method can do things better and develop production faster, no social force will come to obstruct people from adopting this approach.

　　But things are not always completely smooth and ideal. Backward thinking and characters still exist in every corner. He doesn't cherish public property and opposes others interfering with him. He doesn't pay attention to the quality of cultivation and opposes others interfering with him. In particular, he is unwilling for non-cadre members to interfere with him. This is why some conscientious members are sometimes satirized and attacked. "Aha, you don't earn much money, but you manage a lot of things and teach people a lesson!" This kind of evil spirit among a few people often makes some active members feel chilled. They have not fully realized that the existence of this individual negative phenomenon is inevitable, and struggle is inevitable, but victory is certain. Therefore, activists sometimes retreat and become negative.

　　In order for this advanced practice to play a lasting role, not be overthrown, and to be promoted and applied on an increasingly wider scale, we must always pay attention to the various new problems that occur in practice and promptly seize them for resolution. Any good experience and practice can only be promoted and applied under the condition of constantly solving new problems. Anyone who thinks that a good experience can play a role unconditionally, guarantee for three years, guarantee for five years, or even guarantee forever, is not a dialectical materialist.

    领导和被领导之间
    林中
    社队干部整天忙得手脚不停，还是有许多事情办不过来；而社员群众却除了生产劳动之外，什么事也不管，一切等着干部去管。——这是许多农业合作社至今没有解决的矛盾。黑龙江双城县庆城农业社吸收大部分社员参加各方面管理工作的做法，现在看来是解决这一矛盾的有效措施。由社员分组管理各种主要农作物，有效地扭转了一部分社员抢工分不管质量的现象。由社员组成的财务组协助管理社内农具，结果就把农具管得有条有理，消除和减少了农具损失的现象。像政治鼓动这样的工作，人们也许认为必须由干部来做。但事实上社员组织的政治鼓动组也能做很多的事情，起很大的作用。他们帮社员们读报，传播各地先进经验，仅仅这一件事就可以使本社工作更快地进展。
    领导和被领导的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾的一个重要方面。在这里，这种矛盾有效地消除了。社员们自己参加了一部分管理工作，就会体会到当干部的难处，认识到对干部提出过苛的要求是不现实的，没有用处的。同时，也就会积极地想出各种办法来解决少数干部所不能解决的困难问题，使工作的改善和进展大大加快。当社员们感觉到自己不仅是一个“干活的”，而且也是社内的干部和主人的时候，一种新的领导与被领导的关系就产生了：这不是由少数人管理多数人和全社的事，而是由多数人来管理自己的也就是全社的事；每一个社员在某一方面说是被领导者，在另外一个方面却是组织者和领导者；他们都是被领导者，也都是领导者。领导者和被领导者失去了截然的界线，两个概念都有了新的内容。
    多数群众参加领导和管理，在旧时代是不可想像的。但是在社会主义的农村，这却是一种必然的产物。它迟早会在所有的农业合作社出现。因为这里没有利害根本矛盾的剥削者和被剥削者。人们一旦发现这个方法可以把事情办得更好，使生产发展得更快，那就没有什么社会力量会来阻挠人们采取这种做法。
    但事情并非时常都是完全顺利的和理想的。落后的思想和人物在各个角落里都还存在着。他不爱护公物，还反对人家干涉他。他不注意耕作质量，还反对人家干涉他。尤其不愿意非干部的社员来干涉他。这就是有些认真负责的社员有时候还要遭到讽刺打击的原因。“啊哈，你赚钱不多，管事倒不少，教训起人来啦！”这种少数人中间的邪气，时常吹得某些积极社员心里发凉。他们还没有完全觉悟到这种个别的消极现象的存在是必然的，斗争也是必然的，但斗争终必胜利。因此，积极者们有时候就退缩了，消极了。
    为了使这个先进的做法能够长久地发挥作用，不被吹倒，而且越来越在更大的范围内推广应用，就必须经常注意到在实践中发生的各种新问题，及时地抓紧解决。任何好的经验和做法，都只能在不断地解决新问题的条件下得到推广和应用。谁如果以为一条好经验可以无条件地发生作用，保三年，保五年，甚至保永久，那他就不是辩证唯物主义者。
