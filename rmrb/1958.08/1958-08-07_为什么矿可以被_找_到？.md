    Why Can Mines Be "Found"?
    Shigong

    Many mineral discoveries are based on clues provided by the masses. So, can we just wait for the masses to report mines and not look for them ourselves? Obviously, we must rely on the masses, but at the same time, we must use scientific methods to search diligently to discover mineral deposits quickly, efficiently, and economically.

    Minerals have specific "homes" underground. As we find more mines, we can discover patterns. Recently, a large iron ore deposit was found in central Jiangxi, discovered within metamorphic rocks. Therefore, it is possible to find similar deposits in similar rocks in South China. However, searching for oil in metamorphic rocks would be a waste of effort; oil should be sought in layered sedimentary rock areas.

    The distribution of minerals is related to the nature of the rocks, because the Earth's rocks were not all formed at the same time; some are older than others by hundreds of millions of years. In rocks formed before life appeared on Earth, there could be no coal, because coal comes from plants. In the past, in Yanshan, some people tried to mine coal in rocks formed during the Sinian period (a geological era when the existence of life was questionable), which was obviously a fruitless endeavor.

    It seems that the distribution of minerals is also controlled by time.

    During the same period, the minerals formed in different parts of the Earth are also different. For example, rock salt and gypsum are formed in arid regions; peat accumulates in humid swamps; oil is formed in bays; and limestone is a product of the deep sea.

    The distribution of minerals is also affected by the geographical environment at the time of formation.

    When forests are cut down, birds fly away. But after crustal movements and changes in natural conditions, minerals do not have wings, and most will not escape, although they often undergo positional changes. Mastering the rules of these changes makes them easier to find. Some minerals, like oil and natural gas, may be lost along cracks formed during movement, or escape to other suitable locations.

    Crustal movements create new imbalances on the surface. Under new conditions, new minerals are formed. People have found that metal mines are often abundant in areas of intense crustal movement, while coal and oil are often abundant in areas of gentle movement.

    If we can reconstruct the historical appearance of the Earth, then in our eyes it will not just be a mountain or a pile of rocks, but an ancient ocean, swamp, or volcano. We will also seem to see the activities of organisms at that time and feel the climate at that time. In this way, how can minerals not be found? Recently, Soviet scientists have also successfully used radio waves to "see through" ore bodies. Although it can currently only penetrate two or three hundred meters, the future development is limitless. One day, there will be something like Yang Ren's "eye" in the Investiture of the Gods, seeing through the ground, and minerals will be easier to find.

### 为什么矿可以被“找”到？

    为什么矿可以被“找”到？
    石工
    很多矿产的发现，是群众提供的线索，那么能不能等着群众来报矿，不用去找了呢？显然，一方面必须依靠群众，同时要运用科学方法认真地去找，才能多快好省地发现矿藏。
    矿在地下是有着一定的住所的，矿找得多了，我们就可以发现，是有规律可寻的。最近江西中部发现了一个大铁矿，是在变质岩中找到的，因此在华南类似的岩石中也有可能找到；而在变质岩里找石油却是白费气力的，找石油要到那种成层的沉积岩地区去。
    矿产的分布和岩石的性质有关，因为地球上的岩石并不是同时生成，有早有晚，相差达亿万年。在地球上还没有出现生物的时候，那时形成的石头中就不可能有煤矿，因为煤是从植物变来的。过去在燕山，曾有人试图在震旦纪（地质年代，那时有无生物还是疑问）造成的岩石中去开采煤矿，自然是缘木求鱼，一无所得了。
    看来矿产的分布还受到时间的控制。
    在同一个时期中，地球上各处造成的矿产也是不相同的，譬如在干燥的地区生成了岩盐、石膏等；在潮湿的沼泽中堆积了泥炭；在海湾里造出了石油；而石灰岩则是深海的产物。
    矿产的分布还受着生成时的地理环境的影响。
    森林砍尽了，鸟儿会飞走；但是地壳发生运动，自然条件变化了以后，矿产没有翅膀，大部分是不会逃走的，不过往往要发生位置变化。掌握了这种变化的规律，找起来就容易了。有的矿产像石油和天然气，可能沿着运动时生成的裂缝散失，或是逃到别的适于居住的地方。
    地壳运动造成了地面新的不平衡。在新的条件下，新的矿产生成了。人们发现，在那种地壳运动剧烈的地区，往往金属矿多，而运动缓和的地区则往往富于煤和石油。
    如果我们能够恢复地球的历史面貌，那末在我们的眼里就不是一片山、一堆石头，而是远古的海洋沼泽、火山，我们还仿佛看到了当时生物的活动情况，感觉到了当时的气候，这样，矿怎么不可能被找到呢？最近苏联科学家还成功地利用无线电波“透视”矿体。虽然目前还只能透视二、三百公尺厚，但未来的发展是不可限量的。总有一天会出现封神榜中杨任手上那只“眼睛”一样的东西，看透地底下，矿就更容易被找到了。
