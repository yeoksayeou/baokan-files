Xinhua News Agency, 6th: "Vigorously implement the General Line in opera work, use politics to drive art, let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new; take modern plays as the key link to promote a comprehensive leap forward in opera work; while vigorously developing modern plays, continue to conscientiously excavate and sort out traditional plays, and stage new historical plays; on the basis of fully carrying forward excellent traditional art, create a socialist new opera, and powerfully serve workers, peasants and soldiers, and serve socialist revolution and socialist construction." This is the opera work policy put forward by the Symposium on Opera Depicting Modern Life, which recently concluded in Beijing.

The call to action issued to the national opera circles by this symposium is: exert full effort, break superstitions, work hard for three years, and strive to achieve a proportion of modern plays in the repertoire of most opera genres and troupes of 20% to 50% respectively. Strive to have a large number of modern plays with a high degree of ideological content, artistry, and performance skills within three to five years, becoming excellent repertoire pieces.

The symposium was held in Beijing from June 13th and lasted for more than a month. Representatives from twenty-eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions participated in the meeting.

The Shanghai Shanghai Opera Troupe, Hubei Chu Opera Troupe, Hunan Flower Drum Opera Troupe, Henan Yu Opera Troupe No. 3, Fujian Min Opera Experimental Troupe, Jiangsu Xi Opera Troupe, Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, Beijing Ping Opera Troupe, Beijing Quyi Troupe, Emerging Peking Opera Troupe, China Ping Opera Theatre, China Peking Opera Theatre, and other twelve opera troupes attended the symposium and participated in the report performance. The proposal issued by these troupes to the national opera troupes stated that these troupes have decided to work hard for three years to strive to achieve a proportion of modern plays in all performed plays of 20% to 50%, or more than 50%, and to continuously improve their ideological content and performance skills. The proposal stated that these troupes resolutely implement the policy of opera serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, go deep into life, transform their thinking, and continue to develop theater art; diligently study and practice, master the best performing arts of the older generation of artists, and surpass their predecessors.

The symposium believed that since liberation nine years ago, opera has undergone fundamental changes through a series of reforms. The traditional plays that have been staged have been sorted out to preserve the essence and eliminate the dross. In particular, the proportion of modern plays in the repertoire has increased significantly. Since last year, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the nationwide General Line propaganda movement, the movement of opera depicting modern life has been launched on an unprecedented scale and momentum. The meeting pointed out that these situations show that opera has developed to a new stage, and creating a socialist new opera worthy of the great era has become the glorious historical task of all opera workers. Depicting the new socialist era should become the direction of opera work, and modern plays should gradually become the mainstream of opera repertoire. The symposium pointed out that the rapid change in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of workers and peasants urgently requires the use of opera to reflect modern life and struggle. Only when opera can reflect the new era, closely cooperate with the actual struggle and production construction, can it have new development itself. The symposium pointed out that in the future, in the work of opera reform and staging modern plays, it is necessary to adhere to the working methods of putting politics in command and following the mass line, and continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads and the two lines. At present, it is first necessary to resolutely struggle against the bourgeois ideology of being divorced from politics and "art for art's sake," the right-leaning conservative ideology of being content with being in the middle reaches, and the erroneous ideas of valuing the past over the present and mystifying opera; at the same time, it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of neglecting and abandoning excellent traditional plays. It is necessary to walk on two legs.

The symposium believes that prospering the creation of modern plays is a key issue. Under the leadership of the Party committees, all localities should launch a mass movement for the creation of modern plays, advocate the combination of experts and the masses, the combination of individuals and collectives, and the combination of troupes with audiences and authors; train creative backbones, and exchange creative experiences. At the same time, it is necessary to actively sort out and perform excellent traditional plays. In terms of performing arts, it is necessary to study and practice diligently, and boldly innovate and create, surpassing the predecessors. Opera workers must also go deep into the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers and actual struggle to transform their thinking.

During the symposium, many experts in opera, music, performance, and directing gave special speeches. Mei Lanfang, President of the Chinese Opera Research Institute, encouraged opera workers in his speech to work hard to learn and perform modern plays well.

Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, gave a summary report to the conference.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Culture, also attended the meeting and gave speeches. Qian Junrui emphasized that in the reform of opera and the development of modern plays, old artists and new literary and art workers should cooperate closely, learn from each other, and fully carry forward the excellent traditions of opera, so as to create richer, more perfect, and more popular art forms for socialist new opera.

In his speech, Zhou Yang said that the opera reform in the past few years was the first innovation of opera. Now, the proposal to vigorously develop modern plays is the second and most thorough innovation of opera. Zhou Yang said that the crude tendency to treat heritage destroyed the good things in traditional art, while the conservative tendency desperately maintained the bad things in traditional art. Both of these tendencies are undesirable, and at present, we should focus on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking. In fact, conservatives do not truly cherish the tradition of Chinese opera, but cause the tradition to fail to develop anew and stagnate, slowly dying out. Only by implementing the correct policy of weeding through the old to bring forth the new can we truly inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of opera. In his speech, Zhou Yang also called on opera workers to break superstitions, combine diligent study and practice with bold creation, strive to master the excellent traditional skills, and improve the performance level of modern plays. He emphasized that as long as opera workers adhere to the principle of combining with the laboring masses under the leadership of the Party, they will surely be able to realize this great mission.

    以现代剧目为纲
    戏曲表现现代生活座谈会确定戏曲工作方针
    据新华社6日讯　“在戏曲工作中大力贯彻执行总路线，以政治带动艺术，百花齐放、推陈出新；以现代剧目为纲，推动戏曲工作的全面大跃进，在大力发展现代剧目的同时，继续认真发掘和整理传统剧目，并排演新历史剧目；在充分发扬优秀传统艺术的基础上，创造社会主义的新戏曲，有力地为工农兵服务，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。”这是最近在北京闭幕的戏曲表现现代生活座谈会提出的戏曲工作方针。
    这次座谈会对全国戏曲界发出的行动口号是：鼓足干劲，破除迷信，苦战三年，争取在大多数剧种和剧团的上演剧目中，现代剧目的比例分别达到20％至50％。争取在三、五年内有大批现代剧目具有高度的思想性、艺术性和表现技巧，成为优秀的保留剧目。
    座谈会从6月13日起在北京召开，历时一个多月。有二十八个省、市、自治区的代表参加了会议。
    出席这次座谈会并参加汇报演出的上海沪剧团、湖北省楚剧团、湖南省花鼓戏剧团、河南省豫剧三团、福建省闽剧实验剧团、江苏省锡剧团、北京京剧团、北京评剧团、北京曲艺团、新兴京剧团、中国评剧院、中国京剧院等十二个戏曲剧团，向全国戏曲剧团发出的倡议书提出，这些剧团决定苦战三年，争取现代剧目在全部上演剧目中所占比重，分别达到20％到50％，或50％以上，并且不断提高它的思想性和表现技巧。倡议书提出，这些剧团坚决执行戏曲为工农兵服务的方针，深入生活，改造思想，并继续发展剧场艺术；勤学苦练，掌握前辈艺人最优秀的表演艺术，并且超过前辈。
    这次座谈会认为，解放九年以来，戏曲经过一系列的改革，已经发生了根本变化。上演的传统剧目经过整理，存精去糟，特别是上演剧目中现代剧目的比重显著增加了；去年以来，随着工农生产大跃进和全国性的总路线宣传运动，戏曲表现现代生活的运动更以空前的规模和声势开展起来。会议指出，这些情况说明戏曲已经发展到一个新的阶段，创造无愧于伟大时代的社会主义的新戏曲已成为全体戏曲工作者光荣的历史任务，而表现社会主义新时代应成为戏曲工作的方向，现代剧目应当逐渐成为戏曲剧目中的主流。座谈会指出，广大工农劳动群众精神面貌的迅速改变，迫切要求用戏曲反映现代生活和斗争，戏曲也只有能够表现新时代、密切配合现实斗争和生产建设，它本身才能有新的发展。座谈会指出，今后在戏曲改革和上演现代剧目的工作中必须坚持政治挂帅和群众路线的工作方法，继续进行两条道路和两种路线的斗争。目前必须首先同脱离政治、“为艺术而艺术”的资产阶级思想，甘居中游的右倾保守思想，以及厚古薄今、把戏曲神秘化等错误思想进行坚决的斗争；同时也要防止发生轻视和抛弃优秀的传统剧目的偏向。必须两条腿走路。
    座谈会认为，繁荣现代剧目的创作是一个关键问题。各地应在党委领导下，发动群众性的现代剧目创作运动，提倡专家同群众结合，个人与集体结合，剧团与观众、作者结合；训练创作骨干，交流创作经验。同时要积极整理和演出优秀的传统剧目，在表演艺术上，要勤学苦练，并大胆革新创造，超过前人。戏曲工作者还必须深入工农兵群众和实际斗争，改造自己的思想。
    座谈会期间，许多戏曲、音乐、表演、导演等方面的专家做了专题发言。中国戏曲研究院院长梅兰芳在发言中，勉励戏曲工作者下苦功学好并表演现代剧目。
    文化部副部长刘芝明为大会做了总结报告。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬和文化部副部长钱俊瑞也到会讲了话。钱俊瑞强调指出，在戏曲改革和发展现代剧目的工作中，老艺人同新文艺工作者应当密切合作，相互学习，充分发扬戏曲的优良传统，从而为社会主义的新戏曲创造出更丰富、更完美、并为群众喜闻乐见的艺术形式。
    周扬在讲话中说，过去几年的戏曲改革是戏曲的第一次革新。现在提出大力发展现代剧目，则是戏曲的第二次也是最彻底的革新。周扬说，对待遗产的粗暴倾向破坏了传统艺术中的好东西，保守倾向则拼命维护传统艺术中的坏东西。这两种倾向都是要不得的，而目前则应着重反对右倾保守思想。事实上保守派并不是真正爱护我国戏曲传统，而是使传统得不到新的发展而陷于停滞，慢慢灭亡。只有实行推陈出新的正确方针，才能真正继承和发扬戏曲的优秀传统。周扬在讲话中，还号召戏曲工作者破除迷信，使勤学苦练同大胆创造相结合，努力掌握传统的优秀技巧，提高现代戏的表演水平。他强调指出，只要戏曲工作者在党的领导下坚持同劳动群众结合的原则，就一定能够实现这个伟大的使命。
