　　Public Canteens Have Ten Great Advantages
　　Xiang Shan, Director of the Women's Federation of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province

    Baimao Township in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, is an area with abundant land but a shortage of labor. On average, each laborer has to cultivate five to six mu of land. Every year during the summer harvest and planting season, the labor force is extremely strained. This year, the contradiction of insufficient labor is even more prominent. In order to tap labor potential from various aspects, in addition to establishing nursery groups, night soil collection groups, and laundry groups, all 170 production teams in the township have established public canteens. More than 15,000 households have joined the communal dining, accounting for 83% of the total farm households in the township, liberating women from household chores.

　　Establishing Canteens is the Demand of the Masses

    In previous busy seasons, the masses in the township had the habit of dining together and sharing meals while working. During the Great Leap Forward this year, agricultural work was very intense. Some female commune members had complaints, saying: "Men only care about outside work and not the home. Women have to handle both inside and outside, and if they don’t participate in production, they don’t get much work points (meaning fewer work points). If they participate in production, there’s no firewood in the kitchen (meaning no time to cook)." At that time, the Tenth and Thirteenth Communes, based on the demands of the masses, piloted collective canteens in four small teams. The results of the pilot were well-received by the masses. The Township Women's Federation immediately summarized the experience and, under the leadership of the Township Party Committee, made unified arrangements. Public canteens were promoted throughout the township during the spring plowing season.

    The Principles of Running Canteens are Voluntary, Flexible, and Convenient

    When the public canteens were first established, some people had ideological concerns. The most common concerns were about losing out, not being free, and the accounts being in a mess. Households that usually saved grain and had more surplus grain at home were afraid of their surplus grain being consumed publicly. A few wealthy households whispered behind their backs: "Is this real communism? In the past, we shared the fields, now we share the grain, and in the future, we will share houses and furniture!" Some grain-deficient and poor households had a mentality of dependence. After eating in the canteen, they wanted to eat white rice and white porridge every meal, increasing grain consumption by half compared to usual. Therefore, at that time, persuasive education was carried out to address the ideological concerns of the masses, and four principles were stipulated through everyone's discussion: First, the masses run the canteens themselves, handing over grain in lieu of cooking, and processing grain according to the amount handed over, receiving the corresponding amount of meal tickets; no grain adjustment is allowed within the canteen, and no profit is made. Second, communal dining or self-cooking is entirely voluntary, and no forced centralization is allowed. Third, be flexible and diverse, and convenient for the masses. According to the local people's grain-eating habits, canteens generally cook two congees and one rice meal. In order to save grain appropriately, some substitute foods and thin congee are prepared when cooking rice at noon, and households can adjust their consumption of dry or thin food according to the lightness or intensity of agricultural work and the strength of labor. The canteen has one or two common dishes, and commune members can also cook their own dishes and bring them to the canteen to eat. In the event of heavy rain that prevents them from working in the fields, communal dining can also be suspended. Fourth, the scope varies in size, with the principle of convenience for the masses. In villages where the population is concentrated, a canteen is generally established for each production team, and in scattered villages, several canteens are established.

　  Eating in the Canteen is Economical and the Procedures are Simple

    The necessary utensils for the public canteens, such as houses, pots, stoves, bowls, and jars, are all self-funded and self-built by the masses, and the agricultural cooperative does not manage them at all. Households pre-order grain from the canteen every other night or every other meal in the form of hanging signs. The canteen can ensure that there is enough porridge and rice to eat without any surplus, without wasting a single grain of food, by adding a little bit of flexible amount to the pre-order of commune members. At the same time, each canteen has established three "diligent pen, no thinking" current accounts: one is the account of commune members' grain storage and payment (generally paid with grain coupons), one is the cash daily income and expenditure account, and one is the grain storage and daily use account. In terms of procedures, three accounts are consistent, and the three do not meet (that is, the three tasks of managing accounts, managing grain, and weighing grain for cooking cannot be the responsibility of one person). These accounts are very simple, such as the grain storage and payment ledger, just fill in a few lines on the blank pages of the commune members' labor manual, so it can be done clearly every meal and settled every day, and announced at any time after the meal.

  　Public Canteens Have Many Advantages

    After the public canteens were established, they liberated women from household chores such as cooking. They have played a significant role in promoting production, promoting work, and implementing thrift and household management, and have won unanimous praise from cadres and the masses. According to everyone's practical experience, canteens have ten major advantages:

    1.  Can tap labor potential and give full play to the role of women's labor force. There are 4,900 female laborers in the township. In the past, more than 520 people did not attend work due to heavy housework, and more than 3,300 people were late for work and left work early. On average, each person could only work six to seven hours a day. At the same time, because the meal times were not uniform, and the start and end of work were inconsistent, collective waiting often caused wasted work, wasting at least one hour per day. After the establishment of canteens, the work and rest time is unified, and work starts earlier, which can generally increase the attendance rate by 10%, increase the attendance hours by 20%-30%, and improve work efficiency by 40%-50%.

    2.  Can implement planned grain consumption and save grain consumption. When cooking at home, the masses generally only calculate after eating, there is no plan for grain consumption, and more cooking will cause waste. After communal dining in the canteen, every grain consumption is accounted for, so everyone calculates before eating, and there is a unified plan every month, and grain consumption has been reduced compared to the past. For example, Yin Fuyuan, a member of the Second Commune, used to eat 8.2 jin of rice per day for his whole family, but only eats 7 jin in the canteen.

    3.  Can reduce the waste of burning firewood. The fifth team of the Second Commune, with 44 households, used to burn 680 jin of rice straw every day, but now the firewood burned has been reduced to 250 jin.

    4.  Can combine soil fumigation and fertilizer accumulation. Now every canteen has changed its stove, and the canteens in the whole township can fumigate 1.6 million jin of soil every month.

    5.  Can avoid fire and drowning accidents of children. During the summer harvest and planting last year, more than ten fire and drowning accidents occurred due to children cooking and looking after the house, but no similar incidents have occurred this year.

    6.  Convenient to arrange and deploy work. Commune and team cadres reflect: In the past, to notify meetings or direct work, they had to strike gongs and blow horns, or run around. Now, just say a word in the canteen or write it on the blackboard.

    7.  Facilitates strengthening ideological education and enlivening the socialist atmosphere. Each commune and team uses the time after meals for members to rest to organize reading newspapers, listening to the radio, or holding short reports. This enables political work to be regularized and the education scope to be widened.

    8.  Can also use before and after meals to carry out literacy activities. Hang literacy signs and teach members to recognize four or five characters every day.

    9.  Due to the reduction of housework, the elderly and children can also free up time to engage in sideline occupations, cultivate "ten edges" idle land, and increase the income of commune members.

    10. The result of doing so is: production is "early in the season", "good in quality", and "high in autumn harvest yield", and the members have "more labor", "more work points", and "more income after autumn". Ying Quansheng and his wife in the Eleventh Team of the Tenth Commune have three children. Last year, his wife only did thirty workdays throughout the year, and life was very difficult. This year, after the canteen and nursery group were established, his wife did twenty-five workdays during the spring planting stage. Therefore, he said: "The establishment of the canteen has turned me from an overdraft household to a surplus household."

    "In the past, people worked in the fields, but their hearts were at home and they couldn't let go; when they came home to cook, it was not timely, and couples quarreled; if they were not careful, children drowned, houses burned, and unfortunate accidents happened. Now that we have canteens and nurseries, children are taken care of, and meals are cooked, and more work points are earned and quality is improved. We concentrate on production, and our women are really liberated." This is the praise of the new life by the female commune members.

　　公共食堂有十大好处
　　江苏省常熟县妇联主任　项珊
    江苏省常熟县白茆乡是田多劳力少的地区，平均每个劳力要担负耕地五、六亩，历年到了夏收夏种季节，劳动力总是十分紧张。今年，劳力不足的矛盾更加突出。为了从多方面挖掘劳动潜力，除了建立了托儿组、倒马桶组、洗衣组外，全乡一百七十个生产队，队队举办了公共食堂，有一万五千多户社员参加搭伙，占全乡总农户的83％，妇女们摆脱了家务劳动。
　　办食堂是群众的要求
    历年大忙时期，该乡群众素有互相搭伙、伴工吃饭的习惯。在今年大跃进中，农活非常紧张，女社员们有些怨言，她们说：“男人管外不管家，女的里里外外两头抓，不搞生产工分没啥啥（工分少的意思），搞了生产灶堂里面不着柴
  （没有烧饭的意思）。”当时十社、十三社根据群众的要求，就试办了四个小队的集体食堂，试办的结果，群众反映良好。乡妇联马上进行总结，在乡党委领导下，统一做了布置，公共食堂在春耕时期就在全乡范围内推开了。
    办食堂的原则是自愿、灵活、便利
    在公共食堂刚开办的时候，部分群众有些思想顾虑，比较普遍的是怕吃亏，怕不自由，怕账目搞乱。平时用粮比较节约、家中余粮较多的户，怕余粮公吃。个别富裕户在背后窃窃私语：“真的共产啦，过去共田，现在共粮，将来还要共房屋家具呢！”有些缺粮户、困难户存在着依赖思想，到食堂吃饭以后，每顿要吃白饭白粥，用粮比平常增加一半。因此当时针对群众存在的思想，进行了说服教育，并经大家讨论规定了四条原则：第一条：群众自办，交粮代炊，一律按粮代理加工，交多少粮，就领多少饭票；食堂内部不搞粮食调剂，不赚利润。第二条：搭伙或自炊完全根据自愿，不强求集中。第三条：灵活多样，便利群众。根据当地群众吃粮习惯，一般食堂烧二粥一饭，并为了适当节约粮食，中午烧饭时备些代食品与稀粥，各户可根据农活轻重，劳力强弱，自己调剂吃干吃稀。食堂有一二种普通菜，社员也可以自己做菜带到食堂吃。逢到大雨不能下田生产时，还可暂停搭伙。第四条：范围大小不等，以便利群众为原则，村庄较集中的，一般一个生产队建立一个食堂，分散的就建立几个食堂。
　  在食堂吃饭经济、手续简便
    公共食堂的房屋、锅、灶、碗、罐等必要用具，都由群众自筹自办，农业社一概不管；用粮各户隔宿或隔顿用挂牌形式向食堂预定。食堂根据社员预定稍加一点机动数，就能做到每顿粥饭够吃无余，不浪费一点粮食。同时每个食堂都建立了三本“勤笔免思”流水账：一本社员存粮、支付（一般用粮票支付）往来账，一本现金逐日收支账，一本存粮和逐日使用账，手续上做到三账对头，三不见面
  （即管账、管粮和称粮下锅三项工作不能一人负责）。这些账很简单，如存粮、支付往来账，只要在社员劳动手册的空页上填几笔，因此能做到顿清日结，饭后随时颁布。
  　公共食堂好处多
    公共食堂办起来后，将妇女从做饭等家务琐事中解放了出来，对推动生产、推动工作和贯彻勤俭持家等方面，都起了很大的作用，获得了干部和群众的一致好评。根据大家实践的体会，食堂有十大好处：
    一、可以挖掘劳动潜力，充分发挥妇女劳动力的作用。全乡妇女劳力四千九百人，过去因家务重不出勤的有五百二十多人，迟上工、早歇工的有三千三百多人，平时平均每人每天只能劳动六至七小时；同时因为吃饭时间不统一，出工迟早不齐，常常因集体等工而造成窝工，每天至少浪费一小时。举办食堂以后，做到作息时间统一，上工提早，一般可增加出勤率10％，增加出勤工时20％—30％，提高工效40％—50％。
    二、可以贯彻计划用粮、节约用粮。一家一户烧饭时群众一般的都是吃了才算，用粮没计划，而且多烧了还要造成浪费。在食堂搭伙以后，吃粮笔笔有账，因此大家都做到算了才吃，每月都有一个统盘计划，用粮较过去都有了减少。如二社社员殷富元全家原来每天吃米八斤二两，在食堂里只吃七斤。
    三、可以减少烧柴的浪费。二社第五队四十四户，原来每天要烧稻草六百八十斤，现在烧柴减少到二百五十斤。
    四、可以结合熏土积肥。现在每个食堂都改了灶，全乡食堂每个月可熏土一百六十万斤。
    五、可以避免失火和小孩溺水事故。去年夏收夏种中，因是小孩烧饭看家，曾发生失火和小孩溺水事故十多起，今年没有发生类似事件。
    六、便利安排布置工作。社队干部反映：过去通知会议或指挥上工不是鸣锣吹号，就是东奔西跑，现在只要饭堂里说一声或是黑板上写一写就行了。
    七、便于加强思想教育，活跃社会主义气氛。各社队都利用社员饭后休息的时间，组织读报、听广播或开短小的报告会。这样能使政治工作经常化，教育面又广。
    八、还可利用饭前饭后开展扫盲活动。挂了识字牌，每天教社员识四、五个字。
    九、由于家务的减少，老年小孩还可腾出时间搞副业、垦种“十边”闲地，增加社员收入。
    十、这样做的结果是：生产“季节早”、“质量好”、“秋收产量高”，社员的“劳动多”、“工分多”、“秋后收入多”。十社十一队应全生夫妻二人有三个小孩，去年全年妻子只做了三十个工，生活很困难；今年办了食堂和托儿组，他的妻子在春播阶段就做了二十五个工。因此他说：“办了食堂使我由透支户变成余资户。”
    “以前人在田里做生活，心顾家里放不了；回家烧饭不及时，夫妻相骂来争吵；一个不当心，孩子淹死，火烧房子，不幸的事故都来到。现在有了食堂和托儿所，孩子有人管，饭也有人烧，工分做得多，质量提得高，一心一意搞生产，我们妇女真的解放了。”这就是女社员们对新生活的歌颂。
