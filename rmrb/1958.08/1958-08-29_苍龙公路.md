　　"Downhill, legs tremble;
　　Uphill, nose bridge breaks."
　　These are two folk rhymes from the people of Cangxi County, Sichuan Province, describing the inconvenience of transportation in Cangxi. Cangxi is a mountainous area with overlapping peaks and nearly 500,000 people. It is rich in grain, medicinal materials, live pigs, snow pears, and tung oil. The Jiulong, Wufeng, and Longgang Mountains are treasure troves. However, due to the high mountains and deep valleys, the county's eight districts and sixty-one townships are mostly connected by narrow paths. Transportation is blocked, and the treasures are locked away in the deep mountains. After liberation, production increased year after year. To complete the task of transporting goods both out of and into the area, the people of Cangxi had to pay a high price. Statistics from the Longshan and other four districts alone show that labor days spent on grain transportation accounted for about one-third of the total production labor force.
　　To free the labor force from the heavy burden of carrying goods on their shoulders, the people of Cangxi began building the Cang (Cangxi) Long (Longshan) Highway, which runs across Cangxi from north to south, in November of last year. This highway is ninety-six kilometers long, passes through five districts and twenty-three townships in the county, crosses three hundred and two mountain peaks, and spans one hundred and forty ditches.
　　There were no engineers or even the simplest construction machinery to build this highway. But the road builders were not afraid of difficulties. They learned as they went without engineers, and they created their own machinery without construction equipment. On August 1, the entire line was officially opened to traffic. A Liberation-brand car decorated with colored flags and a portrait of Chairman Mao led five other cars from Cangxi amidst the sound of gongs and drums.

　　苍龙公路
　　长成江
    下坡脚杆打抖抖，
    上坡碰破鼻梁骨。
    这是四川省苍溪县人民形容苍溪交通不便的两句民谣。苍溪是一个山区，峰峦重叠，人口近五十万，盛产粮食、药材、生猪、雪梨和桐油等土特产。境内九龙山、舞凤山、龙岗山更是遍地有宝。但因山高沟深，全县八个区，六十一个乡大都靠羊肠小道联系，交通闭塞，遍地宝藏被禁闭在深山老林中。解放后，年年增产，为了完成外调内运的物资输送任务，苍溪人民不得不付出很大的代价。仅龙山等四个区统计，全年用于粮食运输的劳动日，约占全部生产劳动力的三分之一。
    为了把劳动力从繁重的肩挑背背下解放出来，苍溪人民在去年11月开始修筑横贯苍溪南北的苍（溪）龙（山）公路。这条公路全长九十六公里，经过县内五个区，二十三个乡，越过三百零二个山头，横过一百四十条沟渠。
    修建这条公路，没有一名工程师，也没有任何那怕是最简单的施工机械。但筑路的人们不怕困难。没有工程师就边做边学，没有施工机械就自己创造。8月1日，全线正式通车。一辆扎着彩旗、挂着毛主席像的解放牌汽车领着五辆汽车，在锣鼓声中从苍溪开出。
