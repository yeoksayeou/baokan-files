　　Cheng Guansheng Bravely and Resourcefully Saves a Passenger Train

On the afternoon of August 2nd, Cheng Guansheng, a track worker from the Fifth Work Area of the Third Section of the Sixth Bureau of the newly built railway, was walking home from Zijian to Baiwan for a rest after a week of work, as usual.

What was that whooshing sound? Not far ahead of him, he discovered a large hole about 1.5 meters wide and 0.8 meters deep. Soil mixed with ballast was still whooshing and flowing downwards. Ah! The roadbed had collapsed! Cheng Guansheng couldn't help but exclaim. The location of this hole was right on the inside of the 80mm superelevation curve at kilometer 709.1 of the Longhai Line. If a train were to pass by, it would definitely derail. While observing the hole, he thought to himself: he must quickly notify the station. He gave up the idea of going home. In that instant, suddenly a long whistle sounded. Woo! The train's whistle was blowing. Oh no! He looked at his watch, it was just after five o'clock. This was the No. 44 express train from Lanzhou to Shanghai passing through here. "It's a passenger train!" This was terrible! Cheng Guansheng, thinking of the safety of thousands of passengers and the entire train, rushed towards the direction from which the train was coming, regardless of everything. While running, he waved his hands up and down, left and right, to signal the driver to stop immediately, but the driver didn't seem to notice him, and the train continued to speed along. Seeing that the train wasn't stopping, Cheng Guansheng had a flash of inspiration and immediately jumped onto the rails to block the locomotive from advancing. No matter how the driver blew the whistle, he wouldn't budge until the train approached and the driver stopped. Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief. (Ma Zhendong) Chen Zhi Illustration

　　程贯胜机智勇敢救客车
    8月2日下午，新建铁路六局三段五工区的线路工人程贯胜，经过一周的劳动后，照例从滋间往白湾走回家去休息。
    是什么东西哗啦一声响？在他行走的前边不远的地方，发现一个约一点五公尺宽，零点八公尺深的大洞。泥土夹杂着石碴还在哗啦哗啦的往下流。啊！路基塌方啦！程贯胜不由得惊叫了一声。这个洞的位置不偏不依，正在陇海线7091公里处超高80m／m弯道的内侧下面。要是有火车经过，一定会翻车。他一面在观察洞口，一面这样想：他感到一定要赶快通知车站才行，他放弃回家的念头。正在这一刹那间，忽然一声长鸣。呜！火车的气笛在叫。糟了！他一看表正是五点多钟。这是兰州开往上海的四十四次快车通过这里。“是客车”，这还了得！程贯胜想到千百个旅客和整个列车的安全，便不顾一切地向火车开来的方向急急跑去。他一面跑，一面用手上下左右的摆动，通知司机立即停车，但司机好像没有发现他似的，列车依然飞奔驶来。程贯胜一看火车不停，便急中生智，马上跳到钢轨上，阻挡机车前进，任凭司机怎样拉笛，他总是不让路，直到列车驶近，司机停下车来，他才松了一口气。（马震东）陈志插画
