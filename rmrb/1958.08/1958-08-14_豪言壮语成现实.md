　　Grand Words Become Reality
　　Foreign bourgeois journalists, accustomed to the snail's pace and "rock and roll" of capitalist economies, find it difficult to understand the "flying by plane, riding a rocket" speed of socialist economic development.

　　When the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel proposed to advance the coke discharge time of the No. 1 coke oven from the end of this year to September 1, some journalists in capitalist countries said: This is just empty talk. However, the facts are now before us: the date of coke discharge from the No. 1 coke oven of Wuhan Iron and Steel has not only not been delayed, but has been brought forward by nineteen days! What do bourgeois journalists think when they see this news?

　　Here, we might as well say a "big word": The Chinese people, who have already stood up, have unparalleled power to move mountains and seas under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We can do whatever we want to do, and none of our bold words will fail to come true! Those who don't believe it, let them continue to run into walls in the face of the facts!

　  豪言壮语成现实
    外国资产阶级的新闻记者，看惯了资本主义经济的蜗牛爬行和“摇摆舞”，他们对于社会主义经济“乘飞机，坐火箭”般的发展速度是难以理解的。
    当武钢职工提出要把一号焦炉出焦时间由今年年底提前到9月1日的时候，一些资本主义国家的记者说：这是说大话。但是，现在事实摆在眼前：武钢一号焦炉出焦的日子不但没有脱期，反而提前了十九天！资产阶级的新闻记者看到这个消息，不知作何感想？
    我们在这里不妨也说句“大话”：已经站起来了的中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，有着移山倒海的无比力量。我们想干什么就一定能够办到，我们的豪言壮语无一不能兑现！不相信的人，就让他们继续在事实面前碰壁吧！
