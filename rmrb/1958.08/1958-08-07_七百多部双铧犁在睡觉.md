    Over Seven Hundred Double-Share Plows Sleeping
    While farmers across the country are working day and night to study, create, and improve agricultural tools to solve the difficulty of a serious labor shortage, the Baoding Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative (now the Commercial Bureau) warehouse, the Gaobeidian transfer station, has over seven hundred double-wheeled double-share plows sleeping. These new agricultural tools have been sleeping under reed mats, exposed to wind and rain, for nearly two years. According to the staff there: this batch of plows was allocated to seven counties, including Xincheng, Xiongxian, and Dingxing, for promotion, but they could not be sold, so they were stored.
    I have already reported this matter to the relevant departments, but have not yet seen any action. At the same time, I also consider that similar situations may exist in other regions, so I am writing this suggestion to attract attention from all localities.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Xi

    七百多部双铧犁在睡觉
    当全国农民正在夜以继日地钻研创造和改良农具，借以解决劳动力严重不足的困难的时候，保定专区供销社（现在为商业局）仓库高碑店转运站，却有七百多部双轮双铧犁在睡大觉。这批新农具在被风吹雨打而发朽的苇席下睡了将近二年了。据那里的工作人员说：这批犁是分配给新城、雄县、定兴等七个县推销的，可是推销不出去，所以存起来了。
    这个事情我已向有关部门反映了，但是还未见到行动。同时我还考虑到，类似情况在其他地区也可能有，所以特写此建议，以引起各地注意。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　张熙
