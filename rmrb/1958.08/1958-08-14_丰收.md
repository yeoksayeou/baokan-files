　　Bumper Harvest
    The entire Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering, consisting of more than two thousand students, devoted themselves to production labor, spending this year's summer vacation in this way.

    Except for the third-year students of the Department of Hydropower Station Construction, who participated in production internships at the Sanmenxia and Xin'anjiang water conservancy project construction sites, the remaining two thousand students devoted themselves to various types of production labor. Some went to dozens of counties under the Xiaogan and Huanggang Special Districts of Hubei Province to participate in reservoir surveying work. With their support, nearly one hundred reservoirs will be able to start construction this autumn. Others went to the Xiangjiang, Qingjiang, Hanshui, and Danjiangkou Hub and other water conservancy project construction sites, participating in labor operations as ordinary workers. In order to expedite the completion of the new Guanshan Industrial Zone in Wuhan City, hundreds of students also participated in voluntary labor. A portion of the students also participated in physical labor on construction sites within the school and in preparing for the establishment of various factories.

　　丰收
    武汉水利学院全院二千多学生，投入了生产劳动，度过今年的暑假。
    除水电站建筑系三年级学生，参加三门峡和新安江水利工程工地的生产实习外，其余二千学生分别投入了各种各样的生产劳动。有的前往湖北省孝感专区和黄冈专区所属的几十个县，参加水库的测量工作，在他们的支援下，近百个水库将能够在今秋动工兴建；有的到湘江、清江、汉水和丹江口枢纽等水利工程工地上，以普通工人的姿态参加劳动操作；为了使武汉市新建的关山工业区早日建成，几百个学生也参加了义务劳动；还有一部分学生在学校内参加基建工地和筹建各种工厂的体力劳动。
