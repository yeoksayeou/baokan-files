Xinhua News Agency, August 26th - The person in charge of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union made a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters tonight, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable closure of the Chung Wah Middle School and the beating of teachers, students, and journalists present at the scene. They also demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities punish the culprits, compensate the teachers, students, and Chinese journalists of Chung Wah Middle School for all losses, and guarantee that there would be no more unreasonable acts of persecution against the educational cause of the Chinese people in the future.

The person in charge pointed out that after the Hong Kong British authorities unreasonably expelled Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, they used the pretext of the school building being "dangerous" to forcibly close Chung Wah Middle School. This is a serious act of destruction by the Hong Kong British authorities against the educational cause of the Chinese people. The person in charge said that after the Hong Kong British authorities raised the excuse that Chung Wah Middle School buildings were "dangerous," Chung Wah Middle School had applied several times for repairs, but the British authorities refused to reply. Finally, disregarding the reasonable demands of the school's teachers and students, they beat and forcibly evicted the school's teachers and students, which thoroughly exposed the British authorities' destruction of the Chinese people's education cause as a completely planned action.

The person in charge, on behalf of all Chinese educators, expressed condolences to the victimized teachers and students of Hong Kong's Chung Wah Middle School and Chinese journalists and firmly supported their just struggle against the Hong Kong British authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th - The person in charge of the All-China Students' Federation issued the following statement regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable closure of Chung Wah Middle School and the beating of the school's teachers, students, and journalists present at the scene:

The Hong Kong British authorities unreasonably closed Chung Wah Middle School on the pretext of school building problems, and sent a large number of police officers who injured more than 20 students, staff, and journalists present at the scene. We are extremely indignant upon hearing this news. The All-China Students' Federation, on behalf of students throughout the country, expresses a serious protest against this brutal action by the Hong Kong British authorities.

The Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of Chung Wah Middle School is by no means an isolated incident. Recently, the Hong Kong British authorities have carried out a series of wanton acts of destruction against the patriotic education cause of Hong Kong compatriots, further exposing their political conspiracy to antagonize our people.

We want to sternly warn the Hong Kong British authorities: the Chinese people and Chinese students cannot tolerate this kind of action that is hostile to our people. Today's China is not the China of ten or twenty years ago, let alone the China of a century ago. The Chinese people have stood up. The Hong Kong British authorities should know that any action hostile to the Chinese people will only result in them bumping their heads and bleeding profusely.

We express our deep condolences to the teachers, students, and staff of Chung Wah Middle School who are persisting in their struggle. Your struggle is just, and standing with you are the 600 million people of our great motherland, and students throughout the country are supporting you.

We firmly demand that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately stop persecuting the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School, rescind the unreasonable decision to close Chung Wah Middle School, severely punish the perpetrators, and compensate the injured for their losses.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th - The person in charge of the All-China Journalists Association made a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters tonight, expressing strong protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' sending a large number of police officers to forcibly close Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School and beat the school's teachers, students, and Chinese journalists present at the scene covering the event.

The person in charge said that we have received a telegram jointly sent by thirteen Chinese journalists from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School on the pretext of "dangerous school buildings" is a step in their planned destruction of the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong. Because they were afraid that the truth of this brutality would be reported to the wider readership by Chinese journalists, they resorted to the most despicable means, instructing their police to restrict Chinese journalists from interviewing and brutally beating the journalists. We feel extremely indignant at this act of the Hong Kong British authorities who are hostile to the Chinese people, infringing on the freedom of Chinese journalists to interview, and humiliating Chinese journalists, and we raise a serious protest.

This person in charge expressed condolences and support to the victimized Chinese journalists in Hong Kong. The person in charge concluded by saying that the Hong Kong British authorities must bear full responsibility for this brutality.

　　新中国不是百年前旧中国  殖民者要当心今天碰破头
    我教育工会、学联、新闻工作者协会严重抗议香港英国当局暴行
    据新华社26日讯　中国教育工会全国委员会负责人今晚对新华社记者发表谈话，强烈抗议香港英国当局无理封闭中华中学和殴打该校师生与在场新闻记者的罪行，并且要求香港英国当局惩办凶首，赔偿中华中学师生和中国新闻记者的一切损失，保证今后不再发生迫害中国人民教育事业的无理行为。
    负责人指出，香港英国当局继无理驱逐培侨中学校长杜伯奎之后，又以校舍“有危险”的借口，强制封闭中华中学，这是香港英国当局对中国人民教育事业的严重摧残。负责人说，在香港英国当局提出中华中学校舍“有危险”的借口之后，中华中学就曾经几次申请修理校舍，而英国当局拒不答复，最后竟然不顾该校师生的合理要求，殴打该校师生并强行驱逐出校，这就彻底暴露了英国当局对中国人民教育事业的摧残，完全是有计划的。
    负责人代表全体中国教育工作者对受害的香港中华中学师生和中国新闻记者表示慰问，并坚决支持他们同香港英国当局的正义斗争。
    新华社26日讯　中华全国学生联合会负责人对香港英国当局无理封闭中华中学、殴打该校师生和在场新闻记者的事件发表谈话如下：
    香港英国当局借口校舍问题无理封闭中华中学，并且派出大批警察，打伤该校同学、职工和在场的新闻记者二十多人，消息传来，我们感到万分愤慨。中华全国学生联合会代表全国学生，对于香港英国当局的这一残暴行动，表示严重的抗议。
    香港英国当局对于中华中学的迫害，绝不是偶然的事件。最近，香港英国当局对于香港同胞的爱国教育事业，进行了一连串的肆意摧残，进一步暴露了他们敌视我国人民的政治阴谋。
    我们要严正地警告香港英国当局：中国人民和中国学生对于这种敌视我国人民的行动是不能容忍的。今天的中国已经不是十年或二十年以前的中国，更不是一世纪以前的中国。中国人民已经站立起来了。香港英国当局应当知道：一切敌视中国人民的行动，结果只能使他们自己碰得头破血流。
    我们对坚持斗争的中华中学师生们和职工们表示深切的慰问。你们的斗争是正义的，和你们站在一起的，有我们伟大祖国的六亿人民，全国的同学支援着你们。
    我们坚决要求：香港英国当局立即停止对中华中学师生的迫害，取消无理封闭中华中学的决定，严惩肇事人员，并赔偿受伤者的损失。
    据新华社26日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会负责人今晚向新华社记者发表谈话，对香港英国当局派大批警察强行封闭香港中华中学并殴打这个学校的师生和在场采访的中国新闻记者一事，表示强烈抗议。
    负责人说，我们已接到香港中国新闻记者十三人联名发来的电报。香港英国当局借口“校舍危险”强行封闭香港中华中学，是它有计划地摧残香港中国人民爱国教育事业的一个步骤。由于他们害怕这一暴行真相被中国新闻记者报道给广大读者，因此就采取最卑鄙的手段，指使他们的警察限制中国记者采访，并野蛮地殴打记者。我们对香港英国当局这种敌视中国人民、侵害新闻记者的采访自由、殴辱中国新闻工作者的暴行，感到极大的愤慨，并且提出严重的抗议。
    这位负责人向受害的香港中国新闻记者表示慰问和支持。负责人最后说，香港英国当局必须对这一暴行负担全部责任。
