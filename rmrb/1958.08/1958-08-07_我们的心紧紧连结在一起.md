Our Hearts are Closely Linked Together
A Letter from Iraqi Republican Writers to Chinese Writers

To the Chinese Writers Association, to all Chinese Writers:

We, representing the free writers of the newly born Republic of Iraq, salute you, the writers whose ultimate goal is to seek truth and serve humanity. We believe that eliminating all obstacles and evils that lead to the destruction of human culture is one of the main tasks shared by you and us. Therefore, like us in the Republic of Iraq, you are working to defend human rights, promote social justice, and eradicate the enslavement imposed on various nations and peoples by reactionary colonialism under various pretexts. The establishment of our new republic is a manifestation of this struggle. It sincerely expresses our people's desire and determination to coexist peacefully with all peace-loving peoples, and also expresses our desire and determination to create all the necessary conditions for a better life, including developing natural resources and exploiting human potential. This is not for the benefit of a few greedy people, but for the welfare of the entire country and the world. We long for our independence, democracy, and social justice—words that had no meaning under the former reactionary dynasty—to be guaranteed. Therefore, we appeal to you to support our republic's legitimate struggle for a better future, and to stop the US-British aggression against our Arab brothers in Lebanon and Jordan. We believe that you will help your people understand the just demands of our republic, understand that it is supported by the vast majority of our people, and understand that this republic is the result of our people's continuous struggle against the old dynasty in 1941, 1948, 1952, and 1956, and after many revolutionary failures. This is your responsibility, and it is also our responsibility. You have a responsibility, together with us, to condemn any foreign interference in our internal affairs, and interference in the internal affairs of our Arab brothers. If anyone dares to carry out such interference or aggression against us, we will do everything in our power, by all means, and relying on the support of peace-loving countries around the world, to resist. We sincerely hope that reason and the dignity of ordinary people will prevail and stop the aggressive bloc of certain Western countries from constantly dragging the world into the abyss.

We also sincerely hope that world peace and our freedom can be guaranteed.

        Iraqi Republican Writers
        Sari Jawad al-Toma,
        Sara Harris, Abdul
        Malik, Nuri Mahdi M
        irdata, Ali al-Hiri
                            July 30, 1958

Reply from Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association

To Mr. Sari Jawad al-Toma, and all writers of the Republic of Iraq:

We were extremely pleased to read your letter. For more than half a month, we Chinese writers, together with the Chinese people, have been rejoicing in the great victory of the Iraqi people. Because your victory will further inspire the Arab people's just struggle against imperialism and for national independence. Your victory is the victory of the Arab people, and it is the victory of peace-loving people all over the world.

However, your republic has just been born, and the US imperialists have brazenly sent troops to Lebanon for armed intervention, and the British imperialists have also sent troops to Jordan. This aggressive crime of the US and British imperialists not only attempts to eliminate the movement of the people of Lebanon and Jordan to fight for independence, but also attempts to strangle your newborn republic. We feel boundless anger at this blatant aggressive crime of the US and British imperialists. In Beijing and all over China, an unprecedentedly huge protest demonstration of tens of millions of people has immediately erupted. Chinese writers and artists have created countless poems, essays, propaganda posters, and short plays to express their joy at your victory and their deep hatred for the aggressive crimes of the US and British imperialists. We have also suffered from imperialist aggression, we are very familiar with the ferocious face of imperialism, and at the same time we deeply know that seemingly powerful imperialism is actually a paper tiger that appears strong but is weak in reality. The power of the united people of the world is infinitely magnificent. If the aggressors dare to launch a war, the result will definitely accelerate their own demise!

Dear brothers and colleagues, the Chinese people and Chinese writers will always stand with the peace-loving people all over the world, and use our own practical actions to fully support your and all Arab people's just struggle. We use our pens to fight, our hearts are tightly connected with yours. People all over the world are on your side. Justice belongs to you, and victory belongs to you.

        Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association

    我们的心紧紧连结在一起
    伊拉克共和国作家给中国作家们的信中国作家协会全中国的作家们：
    我们代表新生的伊拉克共和国的自由作家们，向你们这些以寻求真理，为人类服务为最终目的的作家们致敬。我们相信：扫除导致人类文化毁灭的一切障碍和罪恶，是你们和我们共同的主要任务之一。因此你们也像我们在伊拉克共和国那样，努力保卫人权，宣传社会正义和根除反动的殖民主义在种种借口之下强加在各民族和人们身上的奴役。我们新共和国的成立，就是这种斗争的一种表现。它真诚地表达了我们人民要和一切爱好和平的人民和平共处的愿望和决心，也表达了我们为了美好生活创造各种必要的条件，包括开发自然资源和挖掘人的潜力的愿望和决心。这不是为了少数贪婪的人的利益，而是为了整个国家和全世界的福利。我们渴望着我们的独立、民主和社会正义——这些词汇在以前反动王朝统治下是没有任何意义的——得到保证。因此我们向你们呼吁，请你们支持我们共和国为美好的未来而进行的合法斗争，阻止美英对阿拉伯兄弟国家黎巴嫩、约旦的侵略。我们相信你们会帮助你们的人民了解我们共和国正义的要求，了解它得到我们绝大多数人民的支持，了解这一共和国是我们人民在1941、1948、1952、1956年连续不断地反对旧王朝的斗争，以及经过许多次革命失败的结果。这是你们的责任，同时也是我们的责任。你们有责任和我们一起斥责任何外国干涉我国内政，干涉我们阿拉伯兄弟国家的内政。如果有人敢于对我们进行这种干涉或侵略，我们将尽一切力量，用一切办法并且依靠全世界爱好和平的国家的支持来抵抗。我们衷心地希望理智和普通人民的尊严会战胜和制止某些西方国家的侵略集团不断地把世界拖向深渊。
    我们也衷心地希望世界和平和我们的自由能够得到保证。
        伊拉克共和国作家

    中国作家协会主席茅盾的回信萨里·约瓦德·阿尔—托玛诸先生伊拉克共和国全体作家们：
    读到您们的来信，我们感到无比地高兴。半个多月来，我们中国作家和中国人民一起，一直为伊拉克人民的伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞。因为，你们的胜利将会进一步激发阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义，争取民族独立的正义斗争。你们的胜利就是阿拉伯人民的胜利，就是全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利。
    但是，你们的共和国刚刚诞生，美帝国主义者竟然出兵黎巴嫩进行武装干涉，英帝国主义者也出兵约旦。美英帝国主义此种侵略罪行，不但企图消灭黎巴嫩和约旦人民的争取独立的运动，并且企图扼杀您们的新生的共和国。对于美英帝国主义此种狂暴露骨的侵略罪行，我们感到无比的愤怒。在北京和全中国各地立刻卷起了空前巨大的数千万人的抗议示威。中国的作家和艺术家，已制作了无数的诗歌、散文、宣传画、短剧，对你们的胜利表示欢呼，对美英帝国主义的侵略罪行表示深恶痛绝。我们也曾遭受帝国主义侵略，我们很熟悉帝国主义的凶恶面目，同时也深知道貌似强大的帝国主义，其实是外强中干的纸老虎。全世界人民团结起来的力量是无限雄伟的。侵略者如果胆敢发动战争，其结果一定就加速它自己的灭亡！
    亲爱的兄弟们和同行们，中国人民和中国作家们将永远和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，用自己的实际行动，全力支持您们和所有阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。我们用自己的笔，从事战斗，我们的心和您们的心紧紧连接在一起。全世界人民都站在您们一边。正义是属于您们的，胜利也是属于您们的。
        中国作家协会主席　茅盾
