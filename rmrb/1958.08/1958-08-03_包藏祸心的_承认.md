    The Sinister "Recognition"
    By our reporter Pan Fei
    On July 30th, the Queen of England mourned the former King Faisal of Iraq, holding a solemn memorial service in a London church. It is rare in British history for a Christian church in England to pray for the souls of a group of Muslims who had been beheaded; from this, one can see how painstakingly the British government arranged this.
    Two days later, the British government suddenly announced shyly: it recognized the Republic of Iraq.
    This is truly a dramatic shift.
    However, the British adoption of such a diplomatic step had been brewing even before the Baghdad Pact meeting. The British ruling group was considering the issue along these lines: First, could recognizing the new Iraqi government possibly "distance" it from relations with the United Arab Republic and socialist countries? At the Baghdad Pact meeting, the United States and Britain did not hide their feelings: perhaps one day, Iraq would still "return" to their embrace. A "Times" reporter commented on the Baghdad Pact meeting, saying: Article 3 of the meeting statement stated that significant changes to the treaty and organization, and whether the treaty should continue in its current form, are being considered by the governments concerned. In fact, it indicates that this aggressive military bloc is "still keeping the door open to Iraq." Second, if it is not possible to immediately overthrow the Republic of Iraq from the outside through military invasion, can another method be used to "change" it from within? Some old "experienced" conspirators undoubtedly consider themselves to be very clever in their past methods of staging coups in the Middle East. Third, if diplomatic relations are not quickly established with Iraq, will Britain's economic power there be replaced by its Western partners? British newspapers have already expressed undisguised anxiety about the movements of West German monopoly capital. The "Daily Express" wrote: "West German entrepreneurs see this revolution and intense anti-American and anti-British sentiment as a perfect opportunity to drive Britain out of Iraq's economic life. The Germans in Baghdad have now held an emergency meeting and telegraphed Adenauer, demanding recognition of the new military regime."
    It is based on these considerations that the British government decided to take a step ahead of the United States and recognize the Republic of Iraq. Of course, it is not a bad thing that Britain can recognize the consolidation of the new Iraqi regime and recognize that it is impossible to overthrow the Qasim government with paratroopers in the next few days. However, being forced to recognize the Republic of Iraq is one thing, and resolving to "lay down the butcher knife" is another. As long as British troops remain in Jordan and American troops continue to occupy Lebanon, the possibility of armed invasion of Iraq will not diminish, and the war crisis in the Middle East will not disappear. On August 1st, another 1,800 American troops landed in Lebanon. It is estimated that the United States and Britain currently have 70,000 troops and 120 warships concentrated in the Middle East. Underestimating the danger of war in the Middle East is obviously wrong. Britain's recognition of the Republic of Iraq, and the United States' orchestration of the presidential election in Lebanon, only illustrate that they are employing both hard and soft tactics, and military and political approaches, in the Middle East.

### 包藏祸心的“承认”

    包藏祸心的“承认”
    本报记者　潘非
    7月30日，英国女王为伊拉克前国王费萨尔哭丧，在伦敦的教堂里举行了一次沉痛的追悼会。在英国基督教的教堂里，为一批已经上了断头台的回教徒招魂，这在英国历史上是少有的怪事；由此也可以看出，英国政府是作了多么煞费心思的安排。
    两天以后，英国政府忽然羞答答地宣布：它承认了伊拉克共和国。
    这真是个富有戏剧性的转变。
    不过，英国采取这样一个外交步骤，早在巴格达条约会议之前，就开始酝酿了。英国统治集团是沿着这样的思路来考虑问题的：第一，承认伊拉克新政府，有没有可能使它同阿联和社会主义国家的关系“疏远”一些呢？在巴格达条约会议上，美国和英国并不隐讳它们的心情：或许有朝一日，伊拉克仍然会“浪子回头”，投到它们的怀抱里来。“泰晤士报”记者在评述巴格达条约会议时说：会议声明第三条说，条约和组织的重大改变，以及条约是否按目前形式继续下去，正由有关政府考虑中。事实上表示这个侵略性的军事集团“仍然向伊拉克开着门的”。第二，如果不可能马上从外部用军事进攻的方式来推翻伊拉克共和国，能不能用另一种方式，从它的内部来加以“改变”呢？一些老有“经验”的阴谋家，无疑地对于他们过去在中东制造政变的一套手法，自认为是十分高明的。第三，如果不同伊拉克很快地建立外交关系，英国在那儿的经济势力，会不会被它的西方同伴取而代之呢？英国报纸对于西德垄断资本的动向，已经表现了无法掩饰的焦虑。“每日快报”写道：“西德的企业家们把这个革命和激烈的反美反英情绪，看作是把英国赶出伊拉克经济生活的绝妙机会。在巴格达的德国人，现在已召开紧急会议，向阿登纳打出电报，要求承认新的军政权”。
    正是基于这些考虑，英国政府决定比美国抢先一步，承认伊拉克共和国。当然，英国能够认识到伊拉克新政权的巩固，认识到不可能用降落伞部队在今后的几天之内把卡塞姆政府推翻，这本来并不是一件坏事。但是，被迫地承认伊拉克共和国是一回事，决心“放下屠刀”又是一回事。只要英国军队仍然赖在约旦，美国军队仍然侵占着黎巴嫩，武装进攻伊拉克的可能性就不会减少，中东的战争危机也不会消逝。8月1日，美国军队一千八百名又在黎巴嫩登陆。据估计，目前美英在中东地区集中了七万军队和一百二十艘军舰。低估在中东的战争危险，显然是错误的。英国承认伊拉克共和国，以及美国在黎巴嫩导演总统选举，只是说明它们在中东正软硬兼施、军事政治双管齐下而已。
