　　　　The Newly Adopted Son

　　After work, I whistled home as usual. Just as I reached the corner of the back wall, the old lady called out, "Stop whistling, come back and have some water, it's getting cold!"
　　I put down the manure bucket and ran into the house without taking off my sheepskin jacket. As soon as I stepped over the threshold, I heard a "whoosh" and my little brother darted out from behind the door, jumping on my back and hugging my neck.
　　"Drink water quickly!" She commanded me as if I were a child. With my little brother on my back, I bent over and leaned my mouth against the edge of the stove, gulping down a large bowl of lukewarm water in one go.
　　"Look how tired this child is!" She was a little angry with me, but her eyes were always smiling. "You haven't even washed your hands, and you call yourselves college students who pay attention to hygiene!" She then pulled the towel from my shoulder: "Let me wipe your mouth!"
　　Suddenly, the old man from the village below came into the house. I handed him the pipe (the Yi people love to smoke pipes). But he looked at me strangely, and the old lady laughed beside him, "This is the child I just adopted." She then turned to me and said:
　　"Call him! Dad!" "Dad!" I called out in response. The old man laughed heartily, "He's a comrade who's been sent down, right?" The old lady said a little displeased, "Sent down or not, he eats with me, lives with me, and he's my family's child."
　　The old lady sat by the stove and arranged the firewood. She said to the old man, "In the past, after pulling out a few meager wheat stalks, we had to go begging with a stick after three days." She stirred the fire, and the flames grew brighter, illuminating her wrinkled face with a red glow. "But everything has changed now! ... Chairman Mao has sent college students to be our children."
　　The old man smiled, took a puff of smoke and exhaled it, his eyes fixed on the ground. He said, "Yes! Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao would send Han comrades to be children of us Yi people!"

　　新收的儿子
    收了工，我照例吹着口哨回家来。刚到后山墙拐角处，大妈就喊起来：“别吹啦，快回来喝水，看都凉啦。”
    我放下粪桶没脱羊皮褂就往屋里跑。一只脚刚迈过门槛，只听见
    “噢”的一声，小弟由门角里窜到我的背上搂住脖子了。
    “快喝水！”她像对小孩一样地命令着我。我背着小弟把腰一躬，就着锅台将嘴往碗边上一靠，一大碗半热不冷的开水一气给喝光了。
      “看这娃娃累哩！”她有点生我的气，可眼睛却一直是笑眯眯的。“手也不洗，还说你们这大学生讲卫生呢！”她又顺手将肩头上的手巾拉了下来：“给我擦擦嘴！”
    忽然，下村的老爹来到了屋里。我把烟筒（彝家都爱用烟筒抽烟）递给他。而他却认生地望着我，大妈一旁笑了起来：“这是我新收来的娃娃。”她又转向我说：
  “喊！阿爹！”“阿爹！”我应声一喊。老爹哈哈大笑起来：“是下放的同志吧？”大妈有点不乐意地说：“下放不下放，跟我吃，跟我住，就是我家娃娃。”
    大妈坐到锅门口把柴火理了理。她对老爹说：“往些年，拔完几根毛毛麦，吃过三天就得拉上棍子去要饭。”她又拨了拨火，火苗更旺了，把她满是皱纹的脸照得红红的。“可眼前啥都变啦！……毛主席把大学生们也给咱派来了。”
    老爹笑了笑，抽口烟又吐出来，两眼盯向了地下。说：“是啊！只有共产党、毛主席才能把汉族的同志派来给咱彝家当娃娃！”
