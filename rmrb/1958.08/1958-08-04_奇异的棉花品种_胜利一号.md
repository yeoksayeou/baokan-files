A Singular Cotton Variety

“Victory No. 1”

A singular cotton variety has appeared on the Aksu oasis in Xinjiang. It does not grow fruit branches or "youtiao" (referring to infertile branches), and the flower buds grow directly from the leaf axils on the cotton plant's stem nodes. Each stem node axil grows two flower buds, supported by two bract leaves, which are larger than those of ordinary cotton. Because it does not grow fruit branches or "youtiao", it does not need pruning.

This singular cotton seed was discovered and cultivated by soldiers of the Victory No. 1 Farm in the Aksu Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, so it was named "Victory No. 1." This year, Victory No. 1 Farm in the Aksu Reclamation Area cultivated twenty mu of this singular cotton seed. According to the soldiers' experimental observations, this cotton showed unique characteristics during its growth period. It grows fast and matures early. When other cotton varieties planted at the same time were just budding, it was already in full bloom with yellow flowers, and the cotton plants also grew more robustly than ordinary cotton. Currently, each cotton plant has grown more than twenty flower buds and is starting to form bolls, with thick boll stems that are not easily detached.

"Victory No. 1" was first selected in 1955 and began to be cultivated separately in 1956. According to two years of cultivation experiments, the fiber length has increased, now growing from thirty-two millimeters to thirty-four millimeters, and it is likely to continue to increase. Because the absorption of nutrients is concentrated on the main stem and cotton bolls, the maturity period is about half a month earlier than ordinary cotton, which correspondingly increases the pre-frost flower yield. This cotton shows even greater superiority in production potential because without fruit branches, each mu can retain 1,500 to 2,000 more plants than ordinary cotton fields. Therefore, "Victory No. 1" is a very promising variety. (Xinhua News Agency)

“Pan-Area Cotton No. 1”

The Henan State-run Yellow River Flood Area Farm has cultivated a new cotton variety. Its characteristic is that the fruit branches are extremely short (about one or two centimeters), and the plant occupies a small space, and it does not need pruning or topping, so it is particularly suitable for mechanical operations, especially mechanical harvesting. Large-scale planting of this cotton can greatly save labor for pruning and topping cotton fields, and it is also convenient for weeding between rows and implementing close planting.

Although this cotton has a lower ginning outturn and shorter lint, it generally has twenty-five cotton bolls per plant, and 8,000 plants can be planted per mu, producing about 2,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.

In 1954, workers at the farm discovered this singular cotton, and began cultivating it from a single cotton plant on the farm. This year, it has already propagated to one hundred and eighty mu. The farm named this new variety "Pan-Area Cotton No. 1."

    奇异的棉花品种
    “胜利一号”
    在新疆阿克苏绿洲上出现一种奇异的棉花品种。它根本不生果枝，也不长油条，花蕾直接长在棉株茎节的叶腋间，每一茎节腋间长着两个花蕾，由两片包叶托着，叶子比普通棉花大。由于它不长果枝和油条，所以不需整枝。
    这种奇异的棉种，是新疆生产兵团阿克苏垦区胜利一场战士们发现和培育的，所以命名为“胜利一号”。阿克苏垦区胜利一场今年培植了二十亩这种奇异的棉种。据战士们试验观察，这种棉花在生长期间就显示出与众不同。它生长得快，成熟得早，同时期播种的其他品种棉花刚刚见蕾，它已经黄花盛开，棉株也比一般棉花长得茁壮。目前，每株棉花已经长出二十多个花蕾，开始结铃，铃柄粗壮，不易脱落。
    “胜利一号”是1955年开始选育，1956年开始单独培育。根据两年的培育试验，纤维长度有所增长，现已由三十二毫米增长到三十四毫米，并有可能继续增长。由于吸收养分集中在主秆和棉铃上，成熟期比普通棉花约早半个月，相应增加了霜前花产量；在生产潜力上，这种棉花表现更为优越，因为没有果枝，每亩可以比一般棉田多留一千五百株到二千株。所以“胜利一号”是一个很有前途的品种。（新华社）
    “泛区棉一号”
    河南国营黄泛区农场培育了一种新棉花品种。它的特点是果枝极短（约一、二公分）、植株所占空间小，不需要整枝打尖，所以特别适宜于机械作业，尤其是机械收获。大面积种植这种棉花可以大大的节省棉田整枝和打尖用工，也便于进行株行间锄草和实行密植。
    这种棉花虽然衣分率较低，绒较短，但是一般每株有二十五个棉桃，每亩可植八千株，每亩可产籽棉约二千斤。
    1954年该场工人发现了这样一种奇异的棉花，就开始在本场从一棵棉花培育起，今年已经繁殖了一百八十亩。该场命名这一新品种为“泛区棉一号”。
