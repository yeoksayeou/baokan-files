Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 4th. All circles in Hong Kong warmly welcome the communiqué of the talks between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union. Many people pointed out that these talks made an immeasurable contribution to world peace.

On the evening of August 3rd at 8:30 PM, many newspapers in Hong Kong rushed to publish "Extra" editions, all carrying the communiqué of the talks between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev. The tens of thousands of copies of the "Extra" editions issued by Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao were quickly snapped up by citizens. Crowds in public places and streets in various districts were all talking about the communiqué.

Hong Kong's maritime workers pointed out that this is the gospel of world peace. At a time when US-British imperialism is stepping up its aggression in the Middle East, the meeting of the leaders of China and the Soviet Union and the reaching of a completely unanimous agreement is undoubtedly a heavy blow to imperialism.

Gao Zhuoxiong, President of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, expressed his welcome to the communiqué, saying: Cooperation between China and the Soviet Union can safeguard world peace. Well-known figures in Hong Kong, such as Pan Bingda and Ye Ruolin, believe that the talks between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union are of global significance.

Huang Zufen, Principal of Hong Kong Chinese Middle School, said: This communiqué expresses the strength of the 900 million people of China and the Soviet Union and is a guarantee of world peace. He Weiwen, Principal of Wei Wen School, and He Huabiao, Head of Academic Affairs of New Overseas Chinese Middle School, condemned the US conspiracy of delaying the summit conference while stepping up the reinforcement of troops in Lebanon. They said that the Sino-Soviet communiqué shows that the peace-loving people of the world are fully capable of stopping wars of aggression.

Hong Kong filmmakers Zhu Shilin, Gong Qiuxia, Li Qiang, Zhang Zheng, Qiao Zhuang, and others also made statements. They all said: Just as US-British imperialism is stepping up the planning of new wars in the Middle East and threatening world peace, the measures taken by China and the Soviet Union to stop aggression and safeguard world peace are very timely. We warmly support the Sino-Soviet communiqué and are determined to unite with the 600 million people of the motherland and the peace-loving people of the world to resolutely demand that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their aggressor troops from the Middle East.
