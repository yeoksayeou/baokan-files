Nanjing Residents Study "Red Flag"

(Our dispatch) The residents of Nanbaotagen, Qinhuai District, Nanjing, are studying the "Red Flag" magazine in reading groups.

80% of the residents of Nanbaotagen, Qinhuai District, make a living by selling vegetables and pushing carts. Many of them have only recently shed their illiteracy. However, they have broken the superstition that the working people have low culture and cannot learn theory, and are studying "Red Flag" in reading groups.

Through study, the residents have greatly improved their ideological understanding. After studying the article "Relying on the Masses, Like a Thunderbolt" in the first issue of "Red Flag," the cadres of the neighborhood committee realized that they must also rely on the masses in their work and consult with them on everything. After studying the article "A Cooperative That Changed Its Face After Two Years of Hard Struggle," which was published in the same issue, many housewives said, "With the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as we are willing to work hard, our Nanbaotagen can also change thatched houses into tile houses and set up community canteens and kindergartens..."

　  南京居民学“红旗”
    本报讯  南京市秦淮区南宝塔根的居民们，在读报组里学习“红旗”杂志。
    秦淮区南宝塔根的居民有80％都以卖菜和推小车为生，其中很多人刚刚摘掉文盲帽子，可是他们破除了劳动人民文化低、不能学理论的迷信，在读报组里学习“红旗”。
    居民们通过学习，在思想认识上有了很大提高。居民委员会的干部学了“红旗”第一期上的“依靠群众，势如破竹”一文后，体会到做居民工作也必须依靠群众，事事要和群众商量。很多家庭妇女在学了同期刊载的“一个苦战二年改变了面貌的合作社”的文章后表示：“有了共产党领导，只要我们肯苦干，我们南宝塔根也能把草房改为瓦房，办起民办食堂、幼儿园……”。（附图片）
