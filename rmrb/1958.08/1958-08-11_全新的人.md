　　A Completely New Person
    While factories and mines are carrying out the all-rounder movement, the Xuguang People's Commune in Echeng, Hubei, has also launched a "universal person" movement. In the past three months, it has cultivated more than 100 "universal people" who are proficient in the complete set of agricultural techniques and also possess several industrial skills, thereby solving the difficulties of lacking labor and technical expertise in the commune-run industries.
    "Universal person" is a completely new type of person cultivated by the new society, they are both farmers and workers. The emergence of "universal people" not only provides a clear answer to the question of who the agricultural communes should rely on to run industries, but more importantly, it points out the path on how to eliminate the differences between workers and peasants.

　　全新的人
    当工矿企业正在开展多面手运动的时候，湖北鄂城旭光一社也开展了“万能人”运动，三个月来，培养了一百多个既会全套农业技术，又会几项工业技术的“万能人”，因而解决了农业社办工业中缺乏劳力和不会技术的困难。
    “万能人”，这是新社会培育出来的一种全新的人，他们既是农民又是工人。“万能人”的出现，不仅对农业社依靠谁办工业的问题作了明确的回答，更重要的还在于它对如何消灭工人和农民之间的差别指出了途径。
