According to the Jiefang Daily, the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has recently extracted shimmering metallic aluminum from coal ash from the Shanghai Power Plant. The successful development of this method for extracting metallic aluminum has opened up a new, faster, better, and more economical path for China's aluminum industry.

According to existing data, in the aluminum industry of various countries around the world, the electrolytic method is generally used to extract metallic aluminum from aluminum ore. This extraction method not only requires large investments and a long construction period, but also requires certain power conditions and aluminum ore resources, making it difficult to popularize widely. In the past, some people were very superstitious about using the electrolytic method for aluminum smelting, and they did not believe that aluminum could be smelted using indigenous methods. Chen Nianyi, Li Jiazhi, Zheng Wensheng, Feng Mingren, and Sun Jinfang, five young scientific workers at the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, boldly broke this superstition and began studying aluminum smelting using indigenous methods in mid-July. During the experiment, these five young researchers received strong support from all sides.

The raw material for aluminum smelting at the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics is ordinary coal ash or soil. According to the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics' analysis, ordinary coal ash generally contains about 30% alumina (ordinary soil also contains about 20% alumina). They added some limestone or lime to the coal ash and sintered it in a native kiln, thus producing calcium aluminate. The calcium aluminate was placed in an ordinary water tank with alkaline water (i.e., sodium carbonate), stirred, and then a sodium aluminate solution was obtained. It was then mixed with sodium fluoride solution, and lime-fluorine gas
  (i.e., carbon dioxide) was introduced, thus obtaining cryolite. After filtering and drying the cryolite, it was placed in a crucible and heated together with metallic sodium, thus finally obtaining metallic aluminum. Throughout the entire production process, in addition to consuming some coal and lime, other materials such as alkaline water, sodium fluoride, and metallic sodium can be recovered and reused, so the production cost is low. According to the preliminary calculations of the comrades at the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, the total cost of building a small alumina plant with an annual output of several hundred tons is only 700 to 800 yuan, but after production begins, all investment can be recovered in one week. The equipment investment for this type of metallic aluminum plant is also estimated to be very small.

    上海创造炼铝土办法
    煤灰当中取出铝
    据解放日报报道　中国科学院上海冶金陶瓷研究所最近在上海发电厂的煤灰中提炼出了银光闪闪的金属铝。这项提炼金属铝的方法获得成功，为我国制铝工业开辟了一条多快好省的新途径。
    据现有资料，在世界各国制铝工业中，一般都是采用电解的方法从铝矿石中提炼金属铝。这种提炼方法不但投资多，建厂时间长，而且需要有一定的电力条件和铝矿资源，这样就难以普遍加以推广。过去，有些人对用电解法炼铝十分迷信，他们不相信能够用土法炼铝。上海冶金陶瓷研究所陈念贻、李家治、郑文升、冯明仁、孙锦芳等五个青年科学工作人员大胆破除了这种迷信，从7月中旬开始研究用土法炼铝。在试验过程中，这五个青年研究员曾得到各方面的大力支援。
    上海冶金陶瓷研究所炼铝的原料就是普通的煤灰或泥土。据上海冶金陶瓷研究所化验，在普通的煤灰中一般都含有30％左右的氧化铝（在普通的泥土中也有20％左右的氧化铝）。他们在煤灰中加上一些石灰石或石灰，放到土窑里去进行烧结，这样便产生了铝酸钙。将铝酸钙放在普通的水缸里加上碱水（即碳酸钠，搅拌后，便取得铝酸钠溶液。然后再和氟化钠溶液混合，通入石灰氟气
  （即二氧化碳），这样便取得冰晶石。将冰晶石过滤烘干后，再放进坩埚和金属钠在一起加热，这样便最后取得了金属铝。在整个生产过程中，除了消耗一些煤和石灰外，其他材料如碱水、氟化钠、金属钠等均可以回收再用，因此生产成本低廉。据冶金陶瓷研究所的同志初步核算，建设一个年产数百吨的小型氧化铝厂，一共只需七、八百元，但在开始生产后，一周就可以收回全部投资。这种金属铝厂的设备投资估计也很少。
