　　The Sabotage Activities of the United States and South Vietnam Must Be Stopped
　　-- Review of the Eighth Interim Report of the International Commission for Vietnam
　　By a commentator of this newspaper
    The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam submitted its Eighth Interim Report to the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on July 5, outlining the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from May 1, 1957, to April 30, 1958.

    From this report, it is very clear that, during the reporting period, U.S. imperialism, colluding with the South Vietnamese authorities, continued to blatantly sabotage the Geneva Accords. South Vietnam has consistently refused to participate in the Joint Commission composed of representatives from both the North and South, which has prevented the resumption of the commission's activities to this day, thereby hindering the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the demilitarized zone. A large number of South Vietnamese military personnel repeatedly and illegally entered the demilitarized zone without the permission of the Joint Commission. South Vietnam continued to carry out large-scale persecution of Vietnamese resistance personnel and refused the supervision of the International Commission. The various U.S. military institutions established under various pretexts in South Vietnam in violation of the Geneva Accords continued to engage in reckless activities. U.S. military aircraft constantly and illegally appeared in various parts of South Vietnam and refused inspection by the International Commission. The United States not only secretly supplied South Vietnam with military aircraft and various weapons, but also, under the guise of so-called "replacement" of weapons taken away by the French Expeditionary Force, is preparing to blatantly transport large quantities of military materials into South Vietnam. The International Commission, disregarding the legitimate opposition of the Polish Commissioner, passed a resolution by a vote of two to one allowing the South Vietnamese authorities to "replace" weapons taken away when the French Expeditionary Force withdrew from South Vietnam, which is clearly inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords. The actions of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities in sabotaging the Geneva Accords have, in fact, paralyzed the International Commission and brought serious threats to peace in Vietnam. Therefore, the Commission could not but express its concern about the South Vietnamese authorities' obstruction of the Commission's supervisory activities on many occasions, and pointed out in the conclusion of the report: If "this trend is allowed to continue, it will make it impossible for the Commission to perform its duties."

    In fact, the sabotage activities of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities are much more serious than those pointed out in the report. The United States is stepping up the expansion of military bases in South Vietnam, building military airfields and strategic highways. Various U.S. military institutions and a large number of military advisory personnel are constantly increasing in South Vietnam. The above-mentioned activities of the United States in South Vietnam are clearly intended to accelerate the construction of South Vietnam into a permanent U.S. military base, as a springboard for it to undermine peace in Vietnam and the entire Indochina, threaten and invade the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and invade and interfere in Southeast Asian countries. The recent armed aggression and subversion activities carried out by the United States in Cambodia by instigating South Vietnam have exposed the above-mentioned aggressive conspiracy of the United States from another aspect.

    Recently, the United States, on the one hand, has colluded with Britain to launch armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and seriously threatened the security of other Arab countries, creating a very tense situation in the Middle East and Near East. On the other hand, it has been using Taiwan, South Vietnam, and South Korea as bases in the Far East to carry out various aggressive deployments and activities, and has sent troops to land in Singapore. The actions of the United States to threaten the peace and security of countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia cannot but arouse the serious vigilance and strong condemnation of all peace-loving countries and people.

    In order to ensure the effective implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, thereby safeguarding peace in Vietnam and Indochina, we believe that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference have the responsibility to take immediate measures to implement the full implementation of the Geneva Accords and stop the destructive activities carried out by the United States in collusion with the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique in Vietnam.

　　必须制止美国和南越的破坏活动
　　——评越南国际委员会第八次临时报告
　　本报评论员
    越南国际监察和监督委员会在7月5日向日内瓦会议两主席提出了第八次临时报告，概述了自1957年5月1日至1958年4月30日期间内日内瓦协议在越南实施情况。
    从这个报告中人们可以十分清楚地看到，在报告期间内，美帝国主义勾结南越当局继续对日内瓦协议进行了露骨的破坏。南越一直拒绝参加应由南北双方代表组成的联合委员会，致使这个委员会的活动至今未能恢复，从而妨害了日内瓦协议在非军事区的实施。大量的南越军事人员未经联合委员会许可一再非法进入非军事地区。南越对越南抗战人员继续进行大规模的迫害，并且拒绝国际委员会的监督。美国违反日内瓦协议在南越巧立名目所设立的各种军事机构继续在进行肆无忌惮的活动。美国军用飞机不断非法地出没南越各地并且拒绝国际委员会的检查。美国不但暗地里供应南越以军用飞机和各种武器，而且，在所谓“替换”法国远征军所携走的武器的幌子下，正准备明目张胆地把各种军事物资大量地运入南越。国际委员会不愿波兰委员的正当反对，以二票对一票竟然通过决议允许南越当局“替换”法国远征军撤出南越时所携走武器，这显然是同日内瓦协议的精神和文字不相符合的。美国和南越当局破坏日内瓦协议的行为，事实上已使国际委员会处于瘫痪状态，为越南的和平带来了严重的威胁。因此，委员会对南越当局在众多场合下阻挠委员会的监督活动不能不表示忧虑，并在报告的结论中指出：如果听任“这种趋势发展下去，将使委员会不能执行其职责。”
    事实上，美国和南越当局的破坏活动比报告中所指出的更要严重得多。美国正加紧在南越扩大军事基地，广建军用机场和战略公路。在南越各地的各种美国军事机构和大量的军事顾问人员正在不断增多。美国在南越的上述活动显然是要加紧把南越建成美国的永久性军事基地，作为它破坏越南和整个印度支那的和平、威胁和进犯越南民主共和国，以及侵略和干涉东南亚各国的跳板。而美国最近策动南越对柬埔寨所进行的武装侵略和颠复活动，正是从另一个侧面暴露了美国的上述侵略阴谋。
    最近，美国一方面纠集英国对黎巴嫩和约旦发动了武装干涉，并且严重威胁其他阿拉伯国家的安全，造成中近东地区的十分紧张的局势，另一方面又在远东利用台湾、南越和南朝鲜作为基地进行种种侵略部署和活动，并且派兵登陆新加坡。美国威胁远东和东南亚各国的和平和安全的行动，不能不引起所有爱好和平的国家和人民的严重警惕和强烈谴责。
    为了确保日内瓦协议在越南的切实实施，从而维护越南和印度支那的和平，我们认为，日内瓦会议与会各国有责任立即采取措施来贯彻日内瓦协议的全部实施，并制止美国勾结南越吴庭艳集团在越南所进行的破坏活动。
