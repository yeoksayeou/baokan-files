    Steaming Ammonia from Peat
    (Southern Daily News) The local fertilizer factory in Zhouxin Township, Qingyuan County, Guangdong, has created a method for steaming ammonia from peat. It can produce 30 catties of ammonia water every one and a half hours, solving the factory's problem of lacking ammonia, one of the raw materials for making local chemical fertilizers.
    The factory's method of steaming ammonia is as follows: Mix 100 catties of wet peat, 105 catties of lime, and 3 catties and 12 taels of clean water. Place the mixture in a steam furnace and poke four holes with a bamboo stick. Then seal the furnace. When the temperature reaches 60 degrees, ammonia gas will start to be produced. The ammonia gas will travel through a cooling cylinder and a gas purification cylinder before finally flowing into an ammonia absorption tank (add 30 catties of water into the tank for every 100 catties of peat steamed), thus becoming ammonia water. (Heating the steam furnace to 130 degrees takes about one and a half to two hours, after which the ammonia gas will be completely extracted.)
    This ammonia water contains a high concentration of nitrogen. Mixed with ferrous sulfate and processed, it can be made into ammonium sulfate.
    The following points should be noted when making and using this ammonia water:
    (1) Ammonia is a gas that volatilizes when heated, so it is best to make and use it immediately, otherwise the concentration will decrease. (2) The steam furnace, ammonia tank, auxiliary tank, and gas purification cylinder must be sealed to prevent air leakage. (Attached picture)

    用泥炭蒸氨
    据南方日报消息  广东清远县洲心乡土化肥厂用土办法创造泥炭土蒸氨，每一小时半可产氨水三十斤，解决了这个厂缺乏制土化学肥料的原料之一——氨的问题。
    这个厂蒸氨方法是：把湿泥炭土一百斤，石灰一百零五斤，清水三斤十二两，拌匀后放入蒸汽炉内，用竹插四个眼，然后密闭，等加热到六十度，便开始产生氨气。氨气随着气管通过冷却缸、净气缸，最后跑到预先放好水的吸氨缸内（蒸一百斤泥炭土，在缸内放三十斤水）便成氨水（蒸汽炉加热到一百三十度，大约一时半至二时，氨气便被抽完）。
    这种氨水本身含有浓度的氮，同青矾混合经过加工，可制成硫酸錏。
    制作和使用这种氨水要注意：
    （一）氨是气体，遇热挥发，因此最好即制即用，否则会降低浓度。（二）蒸汽炉、氨缸和副缸以及净气缸都要密闭不能漏气透气。（附图片）
