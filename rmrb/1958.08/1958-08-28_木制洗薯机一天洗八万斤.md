Xinhua News Agency report: The local state-owned woodworking factory in Gejiu City, Yunnan Province, has produced a wooden sweet potato washing machine that can wash 80,000 jin of sweet potatoes per day. This increases work efficiency more than tenfold compared to washing sweet potatoes manually.

This wooden sweet potato washing machine only requires one person to pour the sweet potatoes and one person to pedal.

The structure of this wooden sweet potato washing machine is simple. It only requires using wood to make a frame, with a hollow cylinder that is small at the top and large at the bottom placed horizontally in the middle. A pedal is made beside the cylinder to drive the cylinder to rotate. Then, the machine body is placed in a pool of water or by a river or ditch, with half of the cylinder immersed in the water. In this way, when a person steps on the pedal to drive the cylinder, the sweet potatoes can be washed.

　　木制洗薯机一天洗八万斤
    据新华社讯　云南省个旧市地方国营木器厂制成一种木质洗薯机，每天可洗甘薯八万斤。比人工洗甘薯提高工效十倍以上。
    这种木制洗薯机，只要一人倒薯，一人脚踏。
    这种木制洗薯机构造简单，只要用木头做成一个架子，中间横放上一个头小底大的空心圆筒，圆筒旁做上一个踏板带动圆筒转动，然后把机身放在水池内或河边、沟边，把圆筒浸入水内一半。这样，人踩踏板带动圆筒，就可洗薯。
