　　Decade of Alkaline Wasteland Transformed into Paradise
　　By Our Correspondent Yang Xiaoji
　　The car leaves the city of Debrecen in eastern Hungary and heads west, slightly north. The terrain gradually slopes downwards, and the population thins out. After about half an hour, you reach the East Canal. Crossing the canal bridge, you arrive at the Hortobágy Puszta.
　　In the past, many mystical legends surrounded the Hortobágy. It was then a boundless, uninhabited desert, with only the Hortobágy creek and an "ancient" inn lying quietly beside it.
　　The Hortobágy was originally a lowland area of ​​five to six thousand holds (each hold being approximately 8.5 mu, or 1.4 acres), which was turned into alkaline land due to the Tisza River's repeated flooding. Even grass and trees were sparse. After the Tisza River was brought under control, it was less prone to flooding but suffered from drought and cracking. When there was too much water, it could not be drained; when there was a lack of water, it could not be drawn. This was the fatal flaw of this region. Whatever grains were planted here yielded little harvest, so it was only used as a grazing area. No one lived here permanently.
　　Before liberation, the areas with better water and grass, especially near the banks of the Hortobágy River, became the spheres of influence of the landlords, and others could not graze there casually. Each landlord had hundreds of cattle, horses, or pigs and sheep, which were taken care of by shepherds.

　　"Three little lambs are beside us,
　　Watched by three shepherds;
　　The sheep with bells walk in front.
　　Hey! He who doesn't scrape his soles (Note 1) isn't a shepherd!

　　"The chimney of the high ground (Note 2) is smoking,
　　Let the sheep scatter at will,
　　Who cares about them!
　　The piece of dry bread stuck in my throat hasn't gone down yet!"

　　This was the song of the shepherds at that time. Regardless of wind, sun, rain, or snow, the shepherds had to stay on this barren alkaline land. They hated the landlords. When they chewed on their hard bread and saw the chimneys of the landlord's manor smoking, they sang this song describing their suffering and feelings.
　　This was a picture of the past before liberation.
　　But now, everything has completely changed.
　　The canal water flows quietly. This waterway, completed just last autumn, is about one hundred kilometers long, of which sixty kilometers surround the Hortobágy. This river and the Hortobágy River, which has been deepened and widened since liberation, are like two major arteries, revitalizing most of the alkaline wasteland.
　　This is a good pasture, and the grass grows very lushly. In some places, corn is planted on the improved land, and irrigation ditches run along the edges. The corn planted on irrigated land seems to grow with a rustling sound every minute under the scorching sun.
　　Some places grow rice. It is said that Hungary did not grow rice before, and it has only started planting it in recent years. Some of the seeds came from China. The Hortobágy is one of the earliest regions in the country to experiment with rice cultivation. Reclaiming alkaline wasteland into paddy fields is a major transformation.
　　Windbreaks are planted near the roads, especially on the farmland near the Hortobágy River. Every few feet, there is a row of trees, like walls, which are both beautiful and can prevent wind and sand and keep the warmth.
　　Since liberation, six state farms have been established in the Hortobágy, with thousands of agricultural workers and experts working here. It is said that the West Canal will soon be opened in the western part of this area, which will further accelerate the soil improvement work in the western part of this region.
　　We visited the Borsos and Ohat State Farms on the banks of the Hortobágy River. The Borsos Farm has 15,500 holds of land, of which 8,000 holds are arable land. The farm was established ten years ago and now has about 1,200 employees. In the past year alone, this farm supplied the state with nine train cars of grain, four train cars of wool, three train cars of pasture, twelve train cars of fish, 120,000 chickens, 400,000 eggs, and 300,000 liters of milk.
　　The Ohat Farm mainly breeds studs. It started with only thirty horses. Now, in addition to the more than two hundred horses sold, it has bred two hundred and sixty-nine thoroughbreds.
　　This former alkaline wasteland is turning into a paradise day by day. Six primary schools have been built here, and each farm has its own nursery and club. New employee residences are increasing daily. People are living happier lives every day. Take the horse herder Badnar Gyula, for example. He is forty-six years old this year and has been herding horses for twenty-seven years. Thinking of the past and the present, he said: One was hell, and the other is heaven, there is no comparison. In the past, he had to herd horses in severe cold of minus thirty degrees, and he also camped in the wild at night. Once it rained for several days in a row, and he wore wet clothes to sleep for several days. But now, he not only doesn't sleep under other people's eaves but sleeps in a very good house with electric lights, running water, and a radio.
　　Now, the "ancient" inn on the bank of the Hortobágy River is state-owned. Every evening, after work, the workers often come here to drink beer and sing loudly:
　　Oh! You bountiful
　　Hortobágy River,
　　How many poor people you have nurtured,
　　You are our dear mother!

　　(Note 1) Refers to the fact that shepherds often have a lot of mud on the soles of their feet, and when walking, they always touch their left foot to their right foot to knock off the mud.
　　(Note 2) Landlords lived in high places, which refers to the place where the landlord lived. (Attached picture)
　　This was once an alkaline depression, but today it has become a fertile field with crisscrossing ditches. The picture shows a Hungarian-made pump boat traveling in the canal. This type of boat can produce rainfall of 21 mm on eight hectares of land in three hours.

### 十年碱洼变乐园

　　十年碱洼变乐园
　　本报记者　杨嚣基
    汽车从匈牙利东部的得布勒森城出发，向西略偏北走，地势逐渐低洼，人烟逐渐稀少，大约半小时后，便到了东运河。过了运河桥，就是霍尔托巴吉洼地。
    关于霍尔托巴吉，过去流传着很多带有神秘色彩的传说。那时，它是一望无际，渺无人烟的荒漠，其间仅静静地横卧着霍尔托巴吉小河沟和沟边的一家“古老”酒店。
    霍尔托巴吉原是一片低洼地，面积有五、六万霍尔特（每霍尔特约合八点五市亩），因历年遭受蒂萨河泛滥淹浸而变成了碱地，草木也稀少。蒂萨河经过修治后，虽不大受水淹了，但却又干旱龟裂。水多时无法排水，缺水时又无法取水，这就是这块地区的致命伤。这里种什么粮食都很少有收成，所以一直只用作放牧区。没有人在此长住。
    解放前，水草较好的地段，尤其是在霍尔托巴吉河两岸附近，都成了地主们的势力范围，别人不能随便到那里去放牧。每个地主都有成百头牛、马或猪、羊，由牧童来看管。
      “三只小羊在我们身边，
    由三个牧羊人看管；
    带铃铛的羊儿走在最前面。
    嗨！不碰擦脚板（注一）的不是牧羊汉！
    “高地（注二）烟囱在冒烟，
    让羊儿们任意跑散，
    管它们呢！
    我喉咙里卡住的面包干还没有咽完！”
    这是当时牧羊人的歌。牧羊人不论风吹、日晒、雨淋都得呆在这片荒碱地上。他们恨透了地主，当他们啃着硬面包，看到地主庄园的烟囱冒烟的时候，就唱起这支描述他们的苦难和心情的歌来。
    这便是解放前的一幅图景。
    但现在却完全变了样子了。
    运河水在静静地流。这条在去秋才修成的河道，长约一百公里，其中有六十公里环绕着霍尔托巴吉。这条河和在解放后挖深挖宽了的霍尔托巴吉河，像是两条大动脉一样，使大部分的碱荒地复苏了。
    这里是一个好牧场，牧草长得很茂盛。有的地方，在改良后的土地上种上了玉米，地头都有灌溉渠。种在水浇地上的玉米在烈日下好像每一分钟都在唰唰地生长。
    有的地方种的是水稻。据说匈牙利以前是不种稻子的，直到最近几年才开始种植，部分种子是从中国来的，霍尔托巴吉就是全国试种水稻最早的地区之一。从碱荒地改良成稻田，这是一个很大的改革。
    在公路附近种有防风林，尤其是在霍尔托巴吉河附近的庄稼地上，每隔数丈就有一道林木，像一堵堵墙一样，既美观，能防风沙，又保温暖。
    从解放后到现在，在霍尔托巴吉已建立起了六个国营农场，有数千名农业工人和专家在这里工作。听说不久还将在这块地区的西面开辟西运河，那将更可加速这块地区西部土壤的改良工作。
    我们访问了霍尔托巴吉河两岸的波尔梭什和奥霍特国营农场。波尔梭什农场有一万五千五百霍尔特土地，其中有八千霍尔特为耕地。农场已建立了十年，现约有职工一千二百人。仅在去年一年中，这个农场供应了国家九火车皮的粮食、四车皮羊毛、三车皮牧草、十二车皮鱼、十二万只鸡、四十万个鸡蛋和三十万公升牛奶。
    奥霍特农场主要是培养种马的。开始只有三十匹马，现在除卖掉的二百多匹外，还繁殖了二百六十九匹良马。
    这片原来的碱荒地已一天天地变成了乐园。这里已建立了六所小学校，每个农场还有自己的托儿所和俱乐部，新的职工住宅日益增加。人们一天天地过得更幸福了。就拿放马工人巴德纳尔·居拉来说吧，他今年四十六岁，已放牧了二十七年。想起了过去和现在，他说：一个是地狱，一个是天堂，不能相比啊。从前他曾在零下三十多度的严寒里放马，夜里同样露宿在野地里。有一次一连下了几天雨，几天都穿着湿衣睡。但是现在他不但不是睡在人家的屋檐下，而是睡在很好的住宅里，有电灯、自来水，还有无线电收音机。
    现在，霍尔托巴吉河边的那家“古老”酒店，已是国有的了。每到黄昏，工人们下班后就常到这里喝啤酒，引吭高歌：
    噢！你这富饶的
      霍尔托巴吉河，
    你哺育了多少穷人啊，
    你是我们亲爱的妈妈！
      （注一）指放羊人脚板上常沾着许多泥土，走路时总要左脚碰右脚，借以把泥土拨掉。
      （注二）地主们住在高地，这里就是指地主住的地方。（附图片）
    这里昔日是碱洼地，今日已成为沟渠纵横的肥沃田园。图上在渠道里行驶的是匈牙利制造的水泵船。这种船三小时内可以在八公顷土地上降雨达二十一粍。
