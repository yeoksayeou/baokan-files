　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Ministry of National Defense today issued a circular commending the meritorious naval units on the Fujian Front. The circular first congratulated a certain torpedo boat unit of the Navy for its major victory on the 24th of this month, in coordination with the coastal artillery and army artillery, in sinking and damaging one Chiang bandit army warship each. It pointed out that this victory, following the fierce bombardment by our artillery on the 23rd of this month, was another heavy blow to the Chiang bandits, demonstrating the power of our People's Navy, posing a serious threat to the maritime connection between the Chiang bandit army entrenched in Jinmen and Taiwan, and putting them in a more difficult situation. The circular specifically commended the personnel who contributed to the battle, and called on them to continue their efforts, closely coordinate with the army and air force units on the front line, and prepare to inflict even greater blows on the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous army reinforcement troops at any time.
