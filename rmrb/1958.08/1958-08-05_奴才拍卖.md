    Notes

    Slave Auction
    According to a Reuters reporter, the "once carefree" puppet King Hussein of Jordan has become "tired and nervous" due to the increasingly fierce opposition from the people. He is constantly worried about his life, and every time he travels, he must have a large group of bodyguards, and he "rarely appears in public."
    Not only that, according to foreign news agencies, this puppet king, in order to escape, completely dropped his mask and put his throne up for auction with a price tag of ten million pounds. He wants to escape for his life and make money at the same time, fully exposing the despicable and greedy ugly face of this reactionary ruler.
    Let's not discuss how many pounds this slave, who is "supported by American money and British troops" (in the words of the British "News Chronicle"), is worth. The question is whether a buyer can be found. Because, as everyone can see, amid the rising tide of resistance from the Jordanian people, this small dynasty is already precarious. Who would be willing to pay a high price to be a scapegoat?

    奴才拍卖
    据路透社记者报道，曾经“一度无忧无虑”的约旦傀儡国王侯赛因，由于人民越来越激烈的反对，已经显得“疲倦和紧张”，终日提心吊胆，害怕丢命，每次出行必有大队人马保镖，而且“很少在公开场合露面”。
    不仅如此，据外国通讯社报道，这个傀儡国王为了脱身，居然完全丢下假面具，标价一千万英镑将自己的王位拍卖。既要逃命，又要捞钱，十足暴露了这个反动统治者卑鄙和贪婪的丑相。
    这个“用美国金钱和英国军队支撑着的”（英国“新闻纪事报”语）奴才的身价究竟值几个英镑，姑且不谈。问题在于能否找到买主。因为，谁都看得清楚，在约旦人民日益高涨的反抗怒潮声中，这个小王朝已经风雨飘摇，又有谁肯出高价来作替死鬼呢？
