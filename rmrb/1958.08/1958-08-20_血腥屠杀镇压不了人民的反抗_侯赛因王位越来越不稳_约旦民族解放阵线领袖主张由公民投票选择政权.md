Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 18th: According to reports from Amman, the situation in Jordan is extremely tense. Despite the imposition of a state of emergency and the mass arrests of those accused of "endangering national security and the throne," the scale of the people's struggle is growing, especially in the West Bank. Even the "Muslim Brotherhood," which had been cooperating with the government, has been forced to protest to the government, demanding the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

According to a report from Amman published in today's "People's News" in Cairo, the Jordanian authorities are carrying out large-scale arrests in the West Bank. Those arrested include military officers, members of parliament, lawyers, and many young people. Many have been killed in prison, and many others have been tortured. Hassan Zaza, the prosecutor of Nablus, was arrested for being lenient towards the people.

A committee composed of British and American military attachés stationed in Amman and King Hussein's uncle, Sharif Nasser, is now responsible for maintaining the security of the King and the government. Security officers receive orders directly from this committee. The committee has also compiled a list of nationalist elements to be arrested.

Most of the royal family have already left Jordan. Only King Hussein and his uncle, Sharif Nasser, remain in the country. The rest have fled to Switzerland with Queen Mother Zein. They are selling their property and belongings. Hussein's land in Karama was put up for sale this week. Several national organizations have issued statements warning people not to buy these properties. The statements said, "They belong to the people and will soon be returned to the people."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 18th:  Abdel Rahman Shukair, leader of the Jordanian National Front, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the evening of the 17th:

"I think the best way to solve the current Jordan problem is the proposal made by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko at the United Nations. This proposal stipulates that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East and that the United Nations send observers to Lebanon and Jordan to supervise the withdrawal." He also said: "I hope to add some supplements to the above proposal, that is, let the Jordanian people hold a referendum to choose their regime."

Shukair gave an exclusive interview to Xinhua News Agency reporters at his Damascus residence.

He refuted Eisenhower's proposal in detail. He emphasized that Eisenhower even talked about economic issues and completely "forgot" the armed aggression, and did not mention the withdrawal of US and British troops. He further pointed out that Eisenhower's proposal to send UN forces to Lebanon and Jordan was to use the United Nations to serve imperialism.

When he mentioned the domestic situation in Jordan, especially after the success of the Iraqi revolution, he said: "Jordan is now like a volcano that could erupt at any time." He said: "If it were not for the landing of British troops in Jordan, it is certain that the Jordanian dynasty would have collapsed long ago." He said that all the people of Jordan unanimously and resolutely oppose the presence of British troops in their country. He pointed out that King Hussein is now like Chiang Kai-shek, only representing himself. He also said: "Hussein's fate now is either to withdraw from Jordan with the British aggressors, or to suffer the same fate as Faisal, Iraq, and other traitors." (Attached picture)

　　血腥屠杀镇压不了人民的反抗
　　侯赛因王位越来越不稳
　　约旦民族解放阵线领袖主张由公民投票选择政权
    新华社开罗18日电  据安曼消息，约旦局势极端紧张。尽管国内实行紧急状态，并且大兴冤狱来对付所谓“危害国家治安和王位”的人，但人民斗争的规模越来越大，特别是在西部。甚至同政府合作的
  “穆斯林兄弟会”也被迫向政府提出抗议，要求英军撤出约旦。
    据开罗“人民报”今天刊载的来自安曼的报道说，约旦当局正在约旦河西岸实行大规模逮捕。被捕的有军官、议员、律师和许多青年。许多人在狱中被杀害，还有许多人受到酷刑。纳布鲁斯的检察长汉桑·扎扎以对人民宽大的罪名被捕。
    一个由驻安曼的英国和美国的武官和侯赛因国王的叔父舍里弗·纳赛尔组成的委员会现在负责维持国王和政府的安全。保安军官们直接从这个委员会接受命令。委员会还编了一份准备加以逮捕的民族主义分子的名单。
    王室人员大部分已经离开约旦。只有国王侯赛因和他的叔父舍里弗·纳赛尔留在国内。其余都同王太后泽恩逃到瑞士去住。他们正在出卖他们的财产和财物。侯赛因在卡拉马的一块土地在这个星期标价出售。一些全国性组织发表声明，告诫人们不要购买这些财产。声明说，“它们属于人民，而且不久将归还人民。”
    据新华社大马士革18日电  约旦民族阵线领袖阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·舒凯尔17日晚上对新华社记者说：
  “我认为解决目前约旦问题的最好办法是苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在联合国提出的建议。这个建议规定一切外国军队立即撤出中东和联合国派遣观察团去黎巴嫩和约旦监督撤军。”他还说：“我希望对上述建议作一些补充，那就是让约旦人民举行公民投票来选择他们的政权。”
    舒凯尔在他的大马士革的寓所里专门对新华社记者发表了谈话。
    他详尽地驳斥了艾森豪威尔的建议。他强调指出艾森豪威尔甚至谈到经济问题而完全“忘掉了”武装侵略，不提美英军队撤出的问题。他进一步指出，艾森豪威尔建议派联合国部队去黎巴嫩和约旦是要利用联合国来为帝国主义服务。
    他在提到约旦的国内情况，特别是在伊拉克革命成功以后的情况时说：“约旦现在正像随时都会爆发的火山一样。”他说：“要不是英国军队在约旦着陆，可以肯定约旦王朝早已垮台了。”他说，约旦全体人民都一致坚决反对英国军队驻在他们的国家。他指出侯赛因国王现在好像蒋介石，只代表他自己。他并且说：“侯赛因的命运现在是或者同英国侵略者一起撤出约旦，或者是遭到费萨尔、伊拉以及其他卖国贼同样的下场”。（附图片）
