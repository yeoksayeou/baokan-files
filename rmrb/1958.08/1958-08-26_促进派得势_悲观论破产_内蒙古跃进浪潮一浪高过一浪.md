Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 25th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Yongxi reports: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has thoroughly broken down right-leaning conservative thoughts such as the "Inner Mongolia Lagging Theory" and the "Special Theory of Ethnic Minority Areas," and industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production has advanced by leaps and bounds, progressing rapidly.

Before the Great Leap Forward and during its course, many right-leaning conservative arguments emerged in Inner Mongolia. For example, in the area of large-scale industrial development and technological innovation, there was the "Inner Mongolia Lagging Theory;" in agriculture, there were the "Nine Droughts in Ten Years Theory" and the "Superiority of Extensive Planting and Low Yields Theory"; in animal husbandry, there were the "Natural Disasters are Invincible Theory" and the "Pasture Saturation Theory"; and even the "Special Theory of Ethnic Minority Areas," and so on. The characteristic of these arguments is that they only see things and not people, and do not look at problems from a developmental perspective. Their essence is pessimism. These arguments seriously hindered the development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous region and violated the Party's general line for socialist construction. Therefore, a struggle between two lines and two methods unfolded on all fronts of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production and construction.

In leading this struggle, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party basically adopted the following method: on the one hand, it continuously criticized right-leaning conservative ideas and various erroneous arguments; on the other hand, it resolutely mobilized the masses to implement the Party's general line using the method of great debate. After the masses were mobilized and created miracles, it used vivid facts to continue to deeply criticize right-leaning conservative thought, so that the Great Leap Forward movement would develop wave upon wave.

The wave of the Great Leap Forward first started with farmland irrigation and water conservancy and pastoral collectivization. Inner Mongolia is severely cold in winter, and there has never been winter construction in the past. Last winter, Party organizations at all levels gave the question of whether or not to carry out farmland irrigation and water conservancy construction in winter to the masses for debate. After the broad masses of peasants liberated their thinking, they began a tenacious struggle against the severe cold. Under the soaring enthusiasm of the various ethnic groups of peasants, the plan to expand the irrigated area in the region was broken through five times. From October of last year to the present, the region has expanded the irrigated area by a total of 12.8 million mu, which, together with the original 12 million mu, averages more than 3 mu of irrigated land per agricultural population. The face of "Nine Droughts in Ten Years" will be changed from now on. Encouraged by the Party's general line, the habits of extensive cultivation and extensive planting and low yields in agricultural production have also undergone great changes. More than 8 million mu of spring wheat in the region has already achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average of more than 200 jin per mu, an increase of about 100% compared with the average yield of 108 jin per mu last year, and many high-yield fields and large-area high-yield fields have emerged. During this period, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee seized the achievements of water conservancy construction, the bumper harvest of spring wheat, and the good growth of autumn crops to forcefully refute the "Nine Droughts in Ten Years Theory" and the "Superiority of Extensive Planting and Low Yields Theory" at various meetings, further liberating people's minds.

In terms of animal husbandry, after the socialist education movement and the great debate on the two roads last winter and this spring, the broad masses of herdsmen resolutely demanded to take the road of collectivization. As of July 5, the number of pastoral households joining the cooperatives in the region had leapt from 27.6% of the total number of pastoral households to 85%. At the Seventh Pastoral Area Work Conference held in late June, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a profound criticism of the "Natural Disasters are Invincible Theory," the "Pasture Saturation Theory" (that is, the carrying capacity of the pasture has reached saturation point), and the "Special Theory" that Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas lack labor force and cannot develop animal husbandry on a large scale, and put forward measures to strengthen various production increases, requiring that the annual increase rate of animal husbandry reach 20% - 25% in the next four years.

In terms of technological innovation and large-scale industrial development, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee severely criticized the "Inner Mongolia Lagging Theory" and superstitious thinking from the very beginning, eliminated feelings of inferiority, and boosted people's spirits, thus creating many miracles. For example, the first-class rate of cashmere and plush, and the unit wool consumption index of the No. 1 Woolen Textile Factory in Hohhot have recently jumped to the first place in the country, and new achievements have also been made in dyeing fastness and reducing processes. The quality of milk powder and cream produced by the Hailar and Yakeshi dairy factories has reached the advanced world level. The wave of the whole people running industries is rising day by day. As of August 15, the number of factories and mines run by the masses in the region had reached more than 112,000, and the first batch of more than 4,000 tons of steel, iron, and copper and other metals, and more than 5,700 tons of cement had been produced.

　　促进派得势  悲观论破产
    内蒙古跃进浪潮一浪高过一浪
    新华社呼和浩特25日电  新华社记者赵永西报道：内蒙古自治区大破“内蒙古落后论”和“民族地区特殊论”的右倾保守思想，工农牧业生产突飞猛进，一日千里。
    内蒙古在大跃进以前和大跃进过程中，曾经出现不少右倾保守论调。如在大办工业和技术革新方面有“内蒙古落后论”，农业方面有“十年九旱论”、“广种薄收优越性论”，牧业方面有“自然灾害不可战胜论”、“牧场饱和论”，甚至还有“少数民族地区特殊论”等等。这些论调的特点是只见物不见人，不从发展上看问题，其实质都是悲观论。这些论调严重地阻碍着自治区各项建设事业的发展，和党的社会主义建设总路线相违背。因此，一场两条路线、两种方法的斗争，便在工农牧业各个生产建设战线上展开了。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会在领导这一斗争中，基本上采取了这样的方法：一方面不断地批判右倾保守思想和各种各样错误论调，一方面用大辩论的方法坚决发动群众贯彻执行党的总路线。而当群众发动起来创造出奇迹之后，又运用生动的事实继续深入地批判右倾保守思想，使得大跃进运动一浪高一浪地不断发展。
    大跃进的浪潮，首先是从农田水利和牧业合作化开始的。内蒙古地区冬季严寒，过去从来没有过冬季施工。去年冬季，各级党组织把冬季能否进行农田水利建设的问题交给群众辩论。广大农民解放了思想以后，便和严寒展开顽强的搏斗。在各族农民的冲天干劲下，全区扩大灌溉面积的计划五次被突破，从去年10月到目前为止，全区共扩大灌溉面积一千二百八十万亩，连同原有的一千二百万亩，农业人口平均每人拥有水地三亩多。“十年九旱”的面貌，将从此改观。在党的总路线鼓舞下，农业生产上耕作粗放和广种薄收的习惯，也有了很大改变。全区八百多万亩春小麦已经获得空前大丰收，平均每亩二百多斤，比去年平均亩产一百零八斤增加约一倍，并出现了很多高产田和大面积丰产田。这期间，内蒙古党委抓住水利建设成就、春小麦丰收和大秋作物生长良好等事实，在各种会议上有力地驳斥了“十年九旱论”、“广种薄收优越性论”，进一步解放了人们的思想。
    畜牧业方面，经过去冬今春的社会主义教育运动和两条道路的大辩论，广大牧民坚决要求走合作化道路，到7月5日止，全区入社牧户已由占总牧户27.6％跃进到85％。中共内蒙古自治区委员会在6月下旬召开的第七次牧区工作会议上，对“自然灾害不可战胜论”、“牧场饱和论”（即牧场的载畜量已经达到饱和点），以及认为内蒙古牧区劳动力缺乏不可能大量发展畜牧业等“特殊论”，又作了深刻批判，并提出加强各项增产措施，要求今后四年畜牧业的每年递增速度达到20％——25％。
    在技术革新和大办工业方面，内蒙古党委一开始就狠狠地批判了“内蒙古落后论”和迷信思想，打掉自卑感，振奋起人们的精神，因而出现了许多奇迹。例如呼和浩特第一毛纺织厂的绒线、长毛绒一等品率和单位用毛量指标等三项，都在最近跃居全国第一，染色牢度和减少工序等也做出新的成绩。海拉尔、牙克石两乳品厂的乳粉、奶油质量都达到了世界先进水平。全民办工业的浪潮，正在日益高涨。到8月15日，全区群众办的厂矿已达到十一万二千多个，已生产出第一批钢、铁、铜等四千多吨，水泥五千七百多吨。
