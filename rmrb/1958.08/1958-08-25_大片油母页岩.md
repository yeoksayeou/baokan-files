　　Large Oil Shale Deposits
    In the northwestern part of the Xinxian Special District of Shanxi Province, along the Yellow River in Baode, Hequ, Pianguan, Xingxian, and four other counties, large oil shale deposits have recently been discovered.

    Preliminary investigations have revealed that the oil shale mining area covers an area of 720 square kilometers, with recoverable reserves of over 2 billion tons. The oil content of the oil shale is very high, averaging around 10% to 20%. This mining area was discovered by the Shanxi Provincial Geological Bureau after a general survey.

　　大片油母页岩
    山西省忻县专区西北部沿黄河的保德、河曲、偏关、兴县等四个县，最近发现大片油母页岩矿。
    初步查明，这个矿区的油母页岩分布面积达七百二十平方公里，可采的储量在二十亿吨以上；油母岩页的含油率很高，平均在10％到20％左右。这个矿区是山西省地质局经过普查后发现的。
