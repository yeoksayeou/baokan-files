　　A Good Teaching Material
    After reading the "Complete Collection of Anti-China Absurdities from the United States" (the full text of the U.S. State Department's memorandum on non-recognition of our country) published in the People's Daily on August 23rd, I felt both angry and amused. I felt angry because the American imperialists have engaged in the most vicious slander and abuse of the Chinese people; I felt amused because this document is tantamount to a complete admission of failure by the U.S. ruling clique in its policy towards China. What is particularly ridiculous is their dream of hoping that the People's Republic of China will one day disappear.
    The author of the "Memorandum" shouts and screams about "non-recognition" of our country, as if our country can only exist if it is recognized by the United States. Who cares about their recognition? Let the likes of Dulles go on dreaming their dreams. We will still advance with firm strides towards our goal—making our country increasingly prosperous and strong.
    I am a middle school teacher, and I have a responsibility to educate my students to love our motherland and also to educate them to be vigilant against our enemies. Therefore, I want to thank the U.S. State Department because it has given me a very good negative example; it will help myself and my students to more resolutely devote ourselves to the cause of building and defending our country.　　Beijing　Liu Jianxin

### 一份好教材

　　一份好教材
    看了8月23日人民日报刊登的美国敌视中国的滥调大全（美国国务院关于不承认我国的备忘录全文）后，使我又气愤又好笑。我感到气愤，是因为美国帝国主义者对中国人民进行了最恶毒的诬蔑谩骂；我感到好笑，是因为这一纸文书无异是美国统治集团在对华政策上遭到彻底失败的自供。特别可笑的是他们那种希望中华人民共和国一旦会消逝的梦想。
    “备忘录”的作者大喊大叫“不承认”我国，好像我们的国家只有得到美国的承认才能存在似的。谁希罕他们的承认？让杜勒斯之流去做他们的梦去吧，我们将依旧以坚定的步伐向着我们的目标——使我们的国家日益富强繁荣——前进。
    我是一个中学教员，我有责任教育我的学生热爱我们的祖国，同时也教育他们对我们的敌人保持警惕。因此我倒要感谢美国国务院，因为它给了我一份很好的反面教材，它将会有助于使我自己和我的学生更坚决地投身于建设和保卫我们国家的事业。　　北京　刘建新
