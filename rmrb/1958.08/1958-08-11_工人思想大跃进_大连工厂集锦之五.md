　　Workers' Thought Leap Forward
　　——Collection of Dalian Factories, Part 5
　　Zheng Zhong

　　During the rectification movement at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, all workers underwent a major debate on "For Whom Do We Labor," clarifying the labor perspective of "I for everyone, everyone for me." The widespread dissemination and discussion of the Party's general line for building socialism, especially the instructions on breaking superstitions, daring to think, speak, and act, eliminated the workers' sense of inferiority. The original spirit of daring to think, speak, and act has sprouted and grown. Combined with the pilot program of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in daily management, the factory has seen a new atmosphere.

　　Unhealthy Phenomena Before the Rectification

　　Before the rectification, the relatively common and prominent problem among workers was individualistic thinking.

　　The manifestations of individualism were roughly:

　　1. Two different attitudes and two different levels of enthusiasm for "piecework" and "hourly work." Some people said: "The socialist principle of distribution is according to labor, more work more pay for 'piecework,' which is according to labor, and less pay for 'hourly work,' so you should work less." Therefore, in the past, they "charged forward for piecework, and loafed on the job for hourly work." When doing piecework, they could work two shifts in a row, or not leave work and go home when the time was up. In order to rush and make more money, they only cared about quantity and not quality, and some even deceived and falsified. The sand washing workers in the foundry workshop consistently did less work and reported more hours. "You (referring to the leadership) revise the work quota, and I record the work and calculate the bills every day."

　　2. Indifference to damaging state property, but very concerned about losing a small amount of personal money. A worker in the locomotive upper part damaged a drill bit worth two yuan and thirty cents and was not distressed, but when five cents were deducted from his pay, he was sad for two days. Afterwards, when working, if there were still twenty or thirty minutes until quitting time, he would calculate that he had almost earned enough, and would stop working.

　　3. Some workers do not care about politics and do not participate in political activities. They said: "The eight hours are the factory's, and the eight hours outside are mine." Some apprentices said: "It's twenty-eight yuan to attend meetings, and it's also twenty-eight yuan not to attend meetings. I'll participate if I get paid."

　　4. Transport workers, crane workers, and auxiliary workers believe they have no future and are useless. Some transport workers said: "We go to work together, we get off work together, but others earn so much money, and we earn so little."

　　Rectification, Heart-to-Heart Talks, and the Emergence of a New Situation of All-Round Leap Forward

　　After the mass debate on "For Whom Do We Labor," all workers underwent a profound communist education. Bourgeois individualistic thinking was discredited, and the white flag was pulled down. Many workers severely criticized the bourgeois individualistic thinking of "everything for me, everything for money." For example, before the rectification, the welding team in the locomotive workshop was a relatively prominent backward team. They had a total of thirty-seven workers, all of whom made relatively profound self-criticisms during the rectification. Tan Youmin made a comparative explanation of himself before and after coming to the factory. He said: "When I first came to the factory, I did piecework and hourly work the same, so that others would say a few good words, and my promotion would be guaranteed. When my iron rice bowl was secured, I was no longer like that. I worked desperately on piecework, and saved some energy to use when doing piecework again. To be honest, from the day I came to the factory, it was all for money. All I thought about all day was money. When I got my salary, I went everywhere to find out how much others earned. If I earned a dime less than others, I would be unhappy. I always thought that money could make the devil push the millstone, and that if I dressed well and had money in my pocket, I would feel good walking on the street, and could act like a big shot. I never thought about who I was working for."

　　Through the great debate, the individualistic thinking among the workers was prominently resolved. The idea of "I for everyone, everyone for me" was clarified, communist thinking grew, and the attitude towards labor also underwent a fundamental change.

　　From the statistics of 3,251 workers in the locomotive, metal structure, machinery, and forging workshops, it can be seen that the changes before and after the great debate on rectification are very significant: the advanced increased from the original 22.6% to 41.1%, the intermediate changed from 61.2% to 52.1%, and the backward decreased from 16.2% to 6.7%.

　　The above changes show that the backward area has been greatly reduced. This change has promoted the change in the appearance of production and strengthened the unity of workers. The workers said well: "After the rectification, our country did not increase equipment or increase people, but added another locomotive and rolling stock factory (last year the annual output was 97 locomotives, and this year the annual output is 250 locomotives)." This is a sign of a huge and profound change.

　　Breaking Superstitions, Emancipating the Mind, and Making a Big Fuss About the Technical Revolution

　　After the workers' great debate on for whom to labor achieved victory, the Party's general line for socialist construction formulated at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress was conveyed to the workers. In the process of discussion, the more prominent problem exposed among the workers was the inferiority complex of believing in others and not believing in themselves. The first was that they thought they had no culture, and that invention and creation were the business of engineers and technicians; the second was that they were afraid of losing face if they failed; they were afraid that leading cadres would not support them; they were afraid of violating the process regulations, especially the old technicians had more such concerns. After the great debate, this inferiority complex was gradually overcome. The old worker Han Guijia of the machine workshop, nicknamed "Old Conservative," but the general line made this iron tree bloom. In the past, he had opinions on individual cadres, and used the excuse of being willing to use old lathes instead of new lathes, because he was afraid of going to jail if something went wrong when using new lathes. Because of his backward thinking, he was not bold in production. Therefore, in the previous stage of airing views, he did not put forward a single opinion, and he never talked about this thought. This time, his son Han Yujiang (Labor Model of Lüda City) exposed his erroneous thinking, and with the addition of the Party's education, his thinking was liberated. In the past, he planed seven axle boxes at a time. After using his brain to study various methods of handling the job, he planed fourteen at a time, increasing efficiency by one time, and he drew drawings at home at night to improve tools. From June 1 to early July, he put forward six innovation proposals, increasing efficiency by one to six times. The thinking of apprentices has also been liberated. For example, when Li Jiaqi, an apprentice in the metal structure workshop, encountered difficulties in cutting iron plates, he wanted to study and improve them, but he thought that his master had many years of experience and had always done it this way. Could an apprentice change the master's method? After studying the general line, his thinking was liberated. He changed a tire mold to cut iron plates, increasing efficiency by three times.

　　In short, the great debate on for whom to labor raised the red flag of the working class and pulled down the white flag of the bourgeoisie. The conveyance of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the propaganda and implementation of the general line, removed the workers' inferiority complex, liberated their thinking, and began to establish a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Another new atmosphere that has emerged is that it has enhanced the mutual cooperation and coordination between workers in the group, between groups, and enhanced the unity between workers.

　　After the above work, in a short period of time, the workers' idea of loving the factory as their home has been greatly developed, and their sense of responsibility as masters has been further strengthened. Caring about production, caring about quality, mutual cooperation, and mutual criticism have begun to become the prevailing atmosphere.

　　工人思想大跃进
　　——大连工厂集锦之五
　　郑重
    大连机车车辆厂在整风运动中，全体工人经过了“为谁劳动”的大辩论，明确了“我为人人，人人为我”的劳动观点。党的建设社会主义总路线，特别关于破除迷信，敢想敢说敢做的指示的广泛传达和讨论，破除了工人的自卑感，敢想敢说敢做的独创精神已发芽成长，结合干部参加劳动、工人参加日常管理工作的试点，该厂出现了新气象。
　　整风前的不健康现象
    整风前在工人中比较普遍突出的问题是个人主义思想。
    个人主义的表现大致是：
    1、干“计件”和干“计时”两种态度，两种干劲。有人说：“社会主义的分配原则是按劳付酬，干“计件”是多劳多得，按劳付酬，干“计时”挣钱少，就应该少干”。因此，过去他们是“计件打冲锋，计时磨洋工。”干计件的时候可以连干两个班，或到点不下班不回家。为了赶点多弄钱，只顾数量不顾质量，甚至有的糊弄欺骗，弄虚作假。铸造车间洗砂工人长时间少干活多报账，“修改工时定额由你（指领导），每日记工算账在我”。
    2、对损害国家财产不在乎，个人少弄了几个钱很心痛，机车上部一个工人打了价值二元三角的钻头不心痛，但扣了他五角钱他却难过两天，以后干活的时候到点还差二、三十分钟，一算干的差不多够本了，就不再干了。
    3、一部分工人不关心政治，不参加政治活动。他们说：“八小时之内是工厂的，八小时之外是我的”。有的徒工说：开会也是二十八元，不开会也是二十八元，开会给钱就参加。”
    4、运搬工人、吊车工人、辅助工人认为没有前途，没出息。有的运搬工人说：“一块上班，一块下班，人家开那么多钱，咱们开这么几个钱”。
　  整风、交心，出现了全面跃进的新局面
    经过“为谁劳动”的群众性的大辩论，全体工人经受了一次深刻的共产主义教育，资产阶级个人主义思想被搞臭了，白旗被拔掉了。许多工人狠狠地批判了“一切为我，一切为了钱”的资产阶级个人主义思想。例如，在整风前，机车车间电焊小组是一个比较突出的落后小组，他们共有三十七个工人，在整风中都作了比较深刻的检查：谭有敏把自己来厂前后做了一个对比的说明，他说：“刚来厂的时候，计件计时一样干，好让别人说上几句好话，升级有保证；当铁饭碗保住了，就不这样了，干计件拼命干，干计时留点劲到干计件的时候再使用。说老实话，我从来厂的那一天起，就是为了钱，整天琢磨的就是钱。开工资时到处打听别人开多少，比别人少开一角钱也不高兴，总认为有钱可以买得鬼推磨，穿得好，兜里有钱就是走在街上精神也足，可以装大爷。为谁劳动我从来就没有想过。”
    通过大辩论，突出的解决了工人中个人主义思想。明确了“我为人人，人人为我”的思想，共产主义的思想增长起来了，劳动态度也起了根本变化。
    从机车、金属结构、机械、锻造四个车间三千二百五十一名工人的统计中可以看出，整风大辩论前后变化很显著；进步的由原来的22.6％上升为41.1％，中间的由61.2％变为52.1％，落后的由16.2％下降为6.7％。
    以上变化说明落后面大大地缩小了，这个变化，促进了生产面貌的改变，工人团结的增强。工人说得好：“整了风我们国家没有增加设备，没有增加人，又多了个机车车辆厂，（去年年产九十七台机车，今年年产二百五十台机车）”这就是巨大深刻变化的标志。
　  破除迷信、思想解放、大闹技术革命
    工人为谁劳动的大辩论取得胜利后，接着向工人传达了党的八大二次会议所制定的社会主义建设总路线。在讨论的过程中，工人中暴露比较突出的问题是相信别人不相信自己的自卑心理。首先是认为自己没有文化，搞发明创造是工程师、技术员的事；其次是怕搞不成丢人；怕领导干部不支持；怕违犯工艺规程，特别是老技工这种顾虑更大些。经过大辩论，这种自卑心理逐步地被克服了。机械车间老工人韩贵甲，绰号叫“老保守”，但是总路线使这棵铁树开了花，他过去曾因对个别干部有意见，借口愿意使用旧床子而不使用新床子，怕使用新床子出了毛病坐牢，由于思想落后生产也不大胆。因此，在前一段鸣放中，他一条意见也没提，这个思想他一直没谈。这次他的儿子韩玉江（旅大市劳动模范）揭发了他的错误思想，再加上党的教育，他思想解放了，过去刨轴箱是一次把七个活，他开动了脑筋学习了多种把活法后，一次把了十四个，提高效率一倍，并且回家连夜画图改进工具，从6月1日到7月初提出六件革新建议，提高效率一至六倍。徒工思想也解放了，如金属结构车间徒工李家琪碰到剪铁板的困难想研究改进，可是他又想师傅有多少年的经验都是这样干法，徒弟还能把师傅的干法改了吗？当学习了总路线以后，思想解放了，他改了一个胎型来切铁板，提高效率三倍。
              ×　×　×
    总之，为谁劳动大辩论，插上了工人阶级的红旗，拔掉了资产阶级白旗。八大二次会议的传达，总路线的宣传和贯彻执行，去掉了工人的自卑心理，解放了思想，开始树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。另外出现的一种新气象是增强了本组工人之间、组与组之间互相协作配合，增强了工人之间的团结。
    经过上述工作，在短期内工人们爱厂如家的思想大大发挥，主人翁责任感更加强了。关怀生产，关怀质量，互相协作，互相批评，已经开始成为风气。
