Xinhua News Agency Report: Pengxi Apples: A "Lean Year" Surpasses a "Boom Year"

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Pengxi County Orchard in Sichuan Province has transformed a "lean year" for fruit trees into a "boom year," setting a new high-yield record of 14,715 jin per mu for apples.

This year, the orchard's 4.2 mu of high-yield apple experimental plots produced a total of 61,807 jin of apples, averaging 14,715 jin per mu, which is six times higher than the average yield of the entire orchard in last year's "boom year." The 147 mu of apples yielded more than 450,000 jin of fruit, an increase of about 57% compared to last year's "boom year."

Fruit trees have "boom years" and "lean years," a natural phenomenon that has long been considered unchangeable by the local people. To break this superstition, the staff of the Pengxi County Orchard made continuous efforts from the beginning of this year. They irrigated to combat drought, ensuring the moisture needed for the fruit trees during the flowering period, and then carried out four large-scale pest control measures. They also applied fertilizer in stages and pruned in a timely manner. In the spring, each tree was fertilized with four jin of vegetable cakes and cottonseed cakes, and three jin of superphosphate; after fruiting, they applied three jin of urea and three jin of ammonium sulfate as top dressing. They pruned all the intersecting branches, dense branches, redundant branches, dead branches, and diseased branches, so that the branches were evenly spaced, well-ventilated, and well-lit. The Pengxi County Party Committee attached great importance to this experience and has decided to open a fruit tree horticulture class at the orchard to teach this advanced high-yield experience.

### 蓬溪苹果  “小年”胜过“大年”

　　蓬溪苹果  “小年”胜过“大年”
    据新华社讯　四川省蓬溪县园艺场变果树“小年”为“大年”，创造苹果亩产一万四千七百一十五斤的高额丰产纪录。
    这个园艺场今年经营的四点二亩苹果高产试验田，共产苹果六万一千八百零七斤，平均亩产一万四千七百一十五斤，比去年“大年”全场平均产量高六倍。一百四十七亩苹果，实收果实四十五万多斤，比去年“大年”增产57％左右。
    果树有“大年”“小年”之分，多年来被当地人民认为不能改变的自然现象。蓬溪县园艺场工作人员为了打破这种迷信，从今年初便进行了不断的努力。他们浇水抗旱，保证果树开花期所需水分，接着又先后进行四次较大规模的防治虫害。他们又分期施肥和适时剪枝。春季每株树施菜饼、棉籽饼四斤，过磷酸钙三斤；结果后又追施尿素三斤，硫酸錏三斤。他们把交叉枝、密生枝、冗枝、枯枝、病虫枝全部剪去，这样枝桠稀密均匀，通风透光。中共蓬溪县委非常重视这一经验，已决定在该场开办果树园艺班传授这一高产先进经验。
