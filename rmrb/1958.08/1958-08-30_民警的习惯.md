    The Habit of a Policeman
    Every morning around seven o'clock, Zheng Shikui, the traffic policeman on duty at Niujie in Beijing, always looks towards the small alleyway after giving a signal. There are no cars or many pedestrians coming from this alley, so why does it attract his attention? It turns out that there is a 68-year-old woman in the alley who comes out to buy groceries every morning. As soon as Zheng Shikui sees the old woman coming, he always carries her basket in one hand and helps her across the road with the other. This has become his habit.
    Zheng Shikui's habit is like a mirror, reflecting how intimate the relationship between the people's police and the masses has become. (Attached image)

    民警的习惯
    每天早晨七点多钟，北京牛街值班交通民警郑世奎，每打一次信号，总要向后边小胡同看看。这小胡同一无来往汽车，二无众多行人，为什么引起他的注意呢？原来胡同里有位六十八岁的老太太，天天早上出来买菜。郑世奎一见老太太走来，总是一手替她提着篮子，一手扶她穿过马路。这已经成为他的习惯了。
    郑世奎的习惯就像一面镜子，它反映了人民警察和群众的关系已经亲密到什么样的境界。（附图片）
