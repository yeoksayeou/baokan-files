    The "National Watercolor Painting Exhibition" sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association is currently being held at the Painted Boat Studio in Beihai Park. The 200 works in the exhibition are outstanding pieces selected from hundreds of works by more than 100 painters from 20 provinces and cities including Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang.

    The painters enthusiastically depict the beautiful scenery of the motherland, the magnificent panorama of socialist construction, and the advanced model figures emerging from various production fronts in the Great Leap Forward.
