Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, August 3rd: The "Karachi Times," in an editorial on August 2nd addressing the steps Pakistan should take after recognizing the Republic of Iraq, pointed out that the Pakistani government should change its attitude towards the West, especially towards the United States, and change its foreign policy.

The newspaper said that the interests of Western countries, especially the United States, are "only partially consistent" with Pakistan's interests, and "when they take any action and make full use of us to defend their interests, they show no understanding of our vital interests, let alone recognize our vital interests."

The editorial said, "For the sake of the West, we have lost our natural allies in the Middle East. For it, we are in the opposing camp with the Soviet Union."

The editorial, in criticizing Pakistan's becoming a part of the so-called "Northern Tier" planned by the United States, pointed out that this clearly exposed the "fundamental helplessness and servile nature of Pakistan's foreign policy."

Commenting on Pakistani President Mirza's recent remarks to reporters that "those who formulated foreign policy are now the ones criticizing foreign policy," the newspaper said, "What's wrong with that? All policies change, especially those related to foreign relations." The newspaper believes that "failure to recognize changes in the situation may put us in great danger, so this is unwise."

"Jang" also pointed out that recognizing the Republic of Iraq "should be the beginning of a new transformation in Pakistani politics."

Some Pakistani political leaders revealed that the foreign policy pursued by Pakistan in the past few years has made Pakistan deeply bound politically and economically by the West. They believe that it is difficult to completely change the current policy. They worry that Western countries may use the threat of canceling aid to Pakistan to force Pakistan to support them.

Other political leaders also believe that it is difficult to change Pakistan's current policy. However, they pointed out that Pakistan should boldly change its current policy, because if it hesitates now, it will be even more difficult later.

This newspaper reports: According to Xinhua News Agency: Pakistan's economic situation continues to deteriorate, and the payment deficit reached 34.4 million rupees in May this year. Solving the foreign exchange difficulties has become an important issue in Pakistan's economy.

Haji Wajihuddin, President of the Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, suggested to the government to reduce export taxes on cotton and jute to encourage exports, and to solve Pakistan's increasingly serious foreign exchange difficulties by stopping issuing import licenses to foreign companies.

Speaking at the annual meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the 1st, Wajihuddin also called on the government to take effective measures to bring back foreign exchange and wealth hidden abroad.

According to a report in the Karachi "Evening Star" on the 1st, Pakistani Finance Minister Amjad Ali has issued an urgent appeal to all government departments, asking them to reduce public foreign exchange expenditures in order to alleviate the increasingly serious foreign exchange difficulties.

One of the measures taken to save foreign exchange expenditure is to require officials to take Pakistan International Airlines flights except in unavoidable circumstances, to send Pakistani diplomats already abroad to represent Pakistan at various international conferences, and to prohibit officials from visiting foreign countries too often.

### 追随西方政策使民族利益受到损害  巴基斯坦舆论要求摆脱美国束缚

    追随西方政策使民族利益受到损害
    巴基斯坦舆论要求摆脱美国束缚
    新华社卡拉奇3日电　“卡拉奇时报”在2日就巴基斯坦承认伊拉克共和国之后应当采取的步骤问题发表社论时指出，巴基斯坦政府应当改变对西方特别是对美国的态度，改变外交政策。
    这家报纸说，西方国家特别是美国的利益同巴基斯坦的利益“只有一部分是一致的，当它们采取任何行动和充分利用我们来保卫它们的利益的时候，它们对我们的切身利益表现出没有任何了解，更不要说承认我们的切身利益了。”
    社论说，“为了西方，我们失去了我们在中东的天然的盟国。为了它，我们才处于同苏联对立的阵营中。”
    社论在抨击巴基斯坦成为美国策划的所谓“北层”的一个部分这件事时指出，这十分明显地暴露出巴基斯坦的“外交政策中根本的无依无靠的状态和奴颜婢膝的性质”。
    这家报纸在评论巴基斯坦总统米尔扎最近对新闻记者发表谈话时所说的“制定外交政策的人现在成了批评外交政策的人”这句话时说，“那有什么错呢？所有政策都会变，特别是同对外关系有关的政策”。报纸认为，“不承认事态的变化，可能使我们遭到很大的危险，因此这是不明智的。”
    “战斗报”也指出，承认伊拉克共和国这件事“应该成为巴基斯坦政治的新转变的开端。”
    一些巴基斯坦政界领袖透露，巴基斯坦过去几年奉行的外交政策使巴基斯坦在政治上和经济上深深受到西方的束缚。他们认为，要彻底改变现行政策是有许多困难的。他们担心西方国家能够以取消对巴基斯坦的援助这种威胁来迫使巴基斯坦支持它们。
    另一些政界领袖也认为，改变巴基斯坦的现行政策是有许多困难的。但是，他们指出，巴基斯坦应该大胆地改变现行政策，因为如果现在迟疑不决，以后就更困难了。
    本报讯　据新华社消息：巴基斯坦经济状况继续恶化，今年5月份支付亏负达到了三千四百四十万卢比。解决外汇困难，已经成为巴基斯坦经济中的一个重要问题。
    巴基斯坦工商业协会会长海季·魏季胡丁向政府建议，削减棉花和黄麻出口税以鼓励出口，并用停止发给外国公司进口许可证的办法来解决巴基斯坦日益严重的外汇困难。
    魏季胡丁1日在工商业协会的年会上发言时还要求政府采取有效措施把藏在国外的外汇和财富提回。
    据卡拉奇“晚报”1日报道，巴基斯坦财政部长阿姆贾德·阿里已经向所有政府部门发出紧急呼吁，要它们减少公家外汇开支，以便减轻日益严重的外汇困难情况。
    为了节省外汇开支而采取的措施之一是，要官员们除在不可避免的情况下，必须乘坐巴基斯坦国际航空公司的飞机，派遣已在国外的巴基斯坦外交人员代表巴基斯坦出席各种国际会议，同时禁止官员们过多地到国外去访问。
