    New Coalfield Discovered in Huaibei

    (According to a report in the Anhui Daily) The 120 Exploration Team, active in the Huaibei Plain, recently discovered two large coalfields east and south of Su County, and conducted a general survey and prospecting of the new coalfield in Tongting, southern Suixi. At the same time, the Suixi Geological Team of the Provincial Geological Bureau further explored the Daiqiao Tangmiao coalfield within the Xiao-Suixi area. The total coal reserves of these four new coalfields are estimated to be over 2.35 billion tons.

    According to preliminary estimates, the areas of approximately 40 square kilometers south of Su County and approximately 30 square kilometers east of Su County are two very large coalfields. The coal reserves amount to over 1 billion tons. In the Tongting area of Suixi County, the coalfield reserves are about 800 million tons, and the coal quality is both coking coal and gas-fat coal, which can be used for industrial coking blending. The total reserves of the Daiqiao Tangmiao coalfield are about 550 million tons. This coalfield is located within Xiao County and Suixi County, stretching 45 kilometers from the Longhai Railway in the north to the west of Suixi City in the south, facing the Zhahe Plain coalfield in the east and west. The coal is buried very shallow here, with only about 90 meters of overburden, making it easy to mine.

    These four new coalfields are close to the Jinpu Railway in the east and connected to the Longhai Railway in the north, making transportation very convenient and possessing significant development value.

    淮北发现新煤田
    据安徽日报消息　活跃在淮北平原的一二○勘探队，最近在宿县东面和南面发现两个大煤田，并对濉溪南部童亭一带的新煤田进行了概查和普查。与此同时，省地质局濉溪地质队也进一步勘探了萧濉境内的岱桥汤庙煤田。这四个新煤田的总储煤量约有二十三亿五千万吨以上。
    据初步估计，在宿县南面约四十平方公里左右，东面约三十平方公里左右地区，是两个很大的煤田。煤的埋藏量达十亿吨以上。在濉溪县童亭一带，煤田蕴藏量达八亿吨左右，而且煤质均系肥煤和气肥煤，可供工业炼焦配煤之用。岱桥汤庙煤田总储量约五亿五千万吨。这个煤田位于萧县、濉溪二县境内，北起陇海铁路，南至濉溪城西，南北长达四十五公里，它与闸河平原煤田东西相对。这里煤的埋藏很浅，浮土仅九十公尺上下，开采容易。
    这四个新煤田，东靠津浦铁路，北连陇海铁路，交通很方便，具有重大开发价值。
