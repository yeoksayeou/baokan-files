    This newspaper reports that the Dalian and Anshan Sports Commissions have opened sports exhibition halls in temple fairs. The content includes picture exhibitions, diagrams illustrating the development of sports over the past few years, and venues for wrestling, martial arts, shooting, and table tennis activities. During the temple fair, souvenirs are given to those participating in various sports activities, and those who reach the level of athlete are immediately issued athlete badges and certificates. Temple fairs are the most familiar and easily accepted form of propaganda and mobilization for the Chinese people and attract the largest number of people.
