    Little Navy Man
    Yuan Heqing
    Seven years ago, the unit welcomed a "Red Scarf."
    The year before that, the American devils ignited the flames of war in Korea, and our motherland, which had just been liberated, was once again under serious threat from the invaders. The flames of war were spreading towards the Yalu River, and the enraged Chinese people once again took up arms and went to the battlefield. Thousands upon thousands of young students flocked to the conscription stations, and among this sea of people, a group of "Red Scarves" squeezed to the front of the older students. One by one, they clenched their small fists, shouting that they were going to fight the American wolves! Among them was Li Dejian.
    The comrades at the conscription station said, "Red Scarves" are too young and don't qualify. Although they pleaded with the uncles and aunts for a long time, it was no use. Li Dejian had been a stubborn child since he was little. Once he was determined to do something, even eight oxen couldn't pull him back. The following year, he came to the naval conscription station again. This time he told a lie, gritted his teeth and took off his beloved red scarf, and relying on his tall stature, stubbornly claimed to be seventeen instead of fifteen. The comrades at the conscription station were deceived, and the "Red Scarf" became a "Little Navy Man." After all, he was still a child! When his stubbornness got the better of him, he didn't care about anything else. The red scarf, it is a symbol of the blood of martyrs, and the lofty honor of the Young Pioneers! How could he just take it off casually and tell a lie! Li Dejian still feels remorseful whenever he mentions this one mistake. Later, when he confessed this mistake to the higher-ups, his eyes were filled with sparkling tears.
    Like spring seedlings after the rain, nourished by ample sunlight and rain, one can almost hear the sound of them shooting up and growing taller; Li Dejian, the "Red Scarf" growing up in the army, was truly like a spring seedling after the rain, deeply receiving the Party's care and education. In just one year, the "Little Navy Man" grew into an adult! Yes! A year ago, he was still a child who saw joining the army as like watching a movie, fantasizing about crossing warships, breaking through giant waves, and directly attacking the enemy's lair. Now, he understands how to put his fantasies into practice, obeys the Party's teachings in everything, and has become a loyal People's Navy soldier.
    The young soldier felt at home on the island, putting down this and picking up that, endlessly doing everything. At this time, the "Little Navy Man" was already a glorious member of the Communist Youth League. The Communist Youth League organization taught this new member in this way. When building barracks, his hands were covered in blisters, and a pair of gloves stuck to his hands. The stubborn "Little Navy Man" didn't tell anyone and silently persevered until the work was completed. Chopping firewood, carrying water, teaching songs, and running the wall newspaper, he volunteered for everything. He also served as a small instructor on the sentry post. During the day, he stood watch like everyone else; at night and during rest time, he took the time to prepare lessons and teach, explaining to his comrades again and again, and demonstrating for everyone dozens of times. Due to his outstanding work, Little Li was awarded a Third Class Merit at the end of the year. People's Hero, how much Little Li hoped to realize such an ideal! Now that the good news was sent home, his elderly mother and older brothers and sisters who were working elsewhere sent congratulatory letters, which made Little Li extremely happy!
    His mind, like his hands and feet, was never still. If he saw something that didn't look right, he would think of a way to "transform" it. Imitating a training signal light, manufacturing a telephone alarm indicator, over the years, he has created a total of twelve pieces of equipment, large and small. This year, he was awarded a Second Class Merit for successfully creating a maritime observation device.
    Speaking of creating the maritime observation device, the story is quite long.
    It was back in 1952 when Little Li had just been transferred to the lookout post and caused a joke. Lookout duty means using one's naked eyes to monitor all activities on the sea and in the sky. One time, he and the deputy squad leader were on duty when they spotted a merchant ship. The deputy squad leader estimated that the ship was eighty meters long. The deputy squad leader asked Little Li, what could Little Li say? Without any basis, he had to agree. But as luck would have it, they guessed right. The higher-ups praised them and asked them to summarize their experience. The praise was already embarrassing enough, and summarizing the experience was even more difficult. Could random guessing be considered an experience? A signal observer is the commander's eyes, and the commander's eyes should be sharper than an eagle, able to penetrate deep mountains and explore the seabed, so that no enemy shrimp soldiers and crab generals can escape the observer's sight! But how could this be done with just a pair of naked eyes! From that time on, the "Little Navy Man" planned to create a maritime observation device.
    Creation is not mysterious, but it is indeed not easy! How much effort did this young soldier put in for this maritime observation device! To create an observation device, but not even knowing what calculation methods to use as a basis. At that time, the "Little Navy Man" was like he had fire on his butt, unable to sit still, coming up with an idea one moment, and another the next; many schemes were designed, but they were all overturned. Later, he heard that the artillery used triangular calculations to measure distance, and this was how he settled on using the principle of triangles to manufacture a maritime observation device. Applying the principle of triangles, but what to do if he had never learned trigonometry? "If you don't understand, can't you learn? No matter how many angles there are, if you want to learn it, you can't escape it!" Relying on his stubbornness, he studied diligently, and he overcame this hurdle in two months. After this, he began the process of making it, and here there were also many difficulties. For a glass tube, all the small medicine bottles in the clinic were used up, and he even got a scare. The story goes like this: when the glass tubes were completely used up, his partner Geng Qinghua took out a transparent chemical pen tube. Who knew that chemical things couldn't stand the heat, and as soon as the soldering iron was placed on it, it went up in flames with a bang, burning off the eyebrows of these two young men. In order to find out whether to put alcohol or glycerin in the level, he had to experiment several times, dozens of times; in order to seal the glass tube, all the bonding methods were tried. … How many similar "small" difficulties were experienced! With many ideas, and after installing a telescope, and after many twists and turns, and after overcoming many difficulties, the maritime observation device was finally successfully trial-produced.
    Seven years have passed. The current Li Dejian is very different from the Li Dejian of seven years ago. The "Red Scarf" of those days is now a glorious Communist Party member, and this glorious People's Navy coastal defense soldier has been stationed on this island for six years, monitoring all enemy activities day and night, and has created many amazing miracles! Rich combat experience has made the "Little Navy Man" fully qualified to serve as the signal squad leader. He often educates his subordinates: "Imperialism is a mad dog, and as long as it has not been finally killed, we must be vigilant. Defending the motherland is not just empty talk, and a signal observer should feel ashamed if he cannot accurately report the situation to his superiors!" He knows the comrades in his squad as well as he knows his own fingers, and he unites the comrades in the squad as one. Last year, out of the eight people in the whole squad, seven were rated as technical experts, and one was rewarded.
    For seven years, on this extraordinary road, he has both been nourished by rain and dew and endured wind and frost. "Red Scarf", Communist Youth League member, Communist Party member, record the path this child has taken politically; student, sailor, squad leader, mark his growth in combat life. Outstanding inventions and creations prove that the "Little Navy Man" has outstanding talent, and actual struggle has promoted the development of his talent. The needs of actual work have "forced" this "Little Navy Man" with only a junior high school education to complete all the high school math, physics, and chemistry courses. Now, the "Little Navy Man" is also preparing to use the acoustic knowledge he has learned to create a listening device to replace ears.

    小海军
    袁鹤青
    七年前，部队里来了一个“红领巾”。
    在这前一年，美国鬼子在朝鲜点起了战火，刚刚获得解放的祖国，重新受到了侵略者的严重威胁。战火正向鸭绿江边漫燃，被激怒了的中国人民，重新拿起武器，走上了战场。成千上万的青年学生拥向参军招生站的门前，在这人海里，一群“红领巾”挤到了大同学的最前面。一个个握起了他们的小拳头，嚷嚷着要去打美国狼！这中间，就有李德俭。
    招生站的同志说，“红领巾”，年岁小，不合格。虽然叔叔阿姨的缠了老半天，结果还是不顶用。李德俭从小就是一个倔性子，只要他下定决心要干什么，就是套上八条大黄牛也拉不回来。第二年，他又来到了海军招生站。这次他撒了一个谎，狠狠心摘下了自己心爱的红领巾，仗着自己的个头挺高的，硬把十五岁说成是十七。招生站的同志受了骗，“红领巾”当上了“小海军”。到底是个孩子呀！倔性子一上头，什么也就不管了，红领巾，它是烈士鲜血的象征，是少先队的崇高荣誉！怎么可以随便的摘下它，而且撒了谎！这个唯一的错误李德俭到现在提起来还痛心。后来当他向上级检讨这次错误的时候，眼里充满了晶莹的泪珠。
    雨后的春苗，得到了充分的阳光、雨露的滋养，它们抽尖拔节的声音都能听得到；生长在部队里的“红领巾”李德俭，真像那雨后春苗一样，深深地受着党的抚育和教导。仅仅一年的日子，“小海军”长成大人了！是啊！一年前，还是个把当兵看作像看电影一样，幻想着跨军舰、破巨浪、直捣敌人老巢的孩子，如今懂得了怎样把幻想放落在实处，一切听从着党的教导，成为了一个忠实的人民海军战士了。
    年轻的小战士，到了岛上就像到了自己的家，放下这，抓起那，无休止地干着一切。这时的“小海军”已经是一个光荣的共青团员了。共青团组织是这样教导这个新团员的。修建营房，两只手磨满了血泡，一双手套粘在了手上，“小海军”这个倔强的孩子，谁也不告诉，一声不响地一直坚持到完工。劈柴、挑水、教唱歌、办墙报，什么事他都抢着干。还担任着哨上的小教员。白天，他和大家一样值班了望；晚上和休息时间，就抽空备课、上课，一次再次地向同志们作讲解，几次、几十次地给大家作示范。由于工作的出色，年底，小李给评上个三等功。人民功臣，小李多么希望实现这样一个理想啊！如今喜报寄回了家，年老的妈妈和在外工作的哥哥姐姐们寄来了祝贺信，这下子可把小李乐坏啦！
    他的脑子和他的手脚一样，一会也不会安静。那里看着不顺眼，他就要想个点子“改造”它一番。仿制个训练信号灯，制造个电话警铃指示器，几年来，大大小小的他共创造了器材十二件。今年，由于创造海上观测器成功，又立上个二等功。
    提起创造海上观测器，故事可就拉长了。
    那还是1952年的事，小李刚调到了望哨，就闹出了一场笑话。了望，就是凭着一双肉眼，监视着海上、天空的一切活动。有一次，他和副班长值班，发现一只商船。副班长估了估，说船长有八十公尺。副班长问小李，小李能说什么呢？毫无依据，只好附和着。可倒碰的巧，真叫他们瞎蒙蒙准了。上级表扬了他们，还要他们总结经验。表扬已经够受的了，总结经验就更抓瞎，难道瞎蒙也能算作一条经验吗？信号观察员是指挥员的眼睛，指挥员的眼睛应该比山鹰的还要锐利，它应该能够穿透深山，深探海底，让敌人的任何虾兵蟹将，都不能从观察员的眼下逃脱！可就凭这一双肉眼，怎能办得到！从那时候起，“小海军”就盘算着创造一个海上观测器。
    创造，并不神秘，可也确不容易！为了这个海上观测器，这位年轻的小战士付出了多少心血啊！创造观测器，可观测器应用什么计算方法作依据都不知道。那时的“小海军”像是火燎着屁股似的，站不安，坐不稳，一会这么想个点子；一会，那么出个主意；方案设计了好多个，可一个个都被推翻了。后来听人说，炮兵是用三角计算距离的，这才算确定了利用三角原理制造海上观测器。应用三角原理，可三角根本没学过怎么办？“不懂，还不作兴学？管它几个角，要学它就跑不了！”就凭他那股牛脾气，死钻硬扣，这一关两个月就闯过了。此后开始了制作，这里也是困难重重。为了一个玻璃管，把门诊所里的小药瓶都给用光了，结果还受了一场虚惊。事情经过是这样：玻璃管实在用光了，他的伙伴耿庆华就把一只透明的化学钢笔杆拿了出来，谁知化学东西这玩意见不得热，烙铁刚刚一放上，轰的一下着了火，把这两个小青年的眉毛都给烧光了。为了弄清水准器里应该装酒精还是甘油，就得几次几十次的实验；为了密封玻璃管，所有的粘接方法都试了个遍。……类似这样的“小”困难经历了多少啊！很多点子，安装上一架望远镜，几经曲折，排除了重重困难，海上观测器最后终于试制成功了。
    七年过去了。现在的李德俭和七年前的李德俭已经大不相同了，当年的“红领巾”，现在已经是一个光荣的共产党员，这个光荣的人民海防战士，六年来一直坚持在这个海岛上，日日夜夜地监视着敌人的一切活动，并且创造了很多惊人的奇迹！丰富的斗争经验使“小海军”完全称职地担任信号班长的职务。他经常教育着自己的部属：“帝国主义是条疯狗，只要它还没有最后被打死，就必须提高警惕。保卫祖国不是一句空话，一个信号观察员不能准确地将情况报告上级，应该感到可耻！”他熟悉班里同志就像熟悉自己的手指头一样，把班里同志团结得像是一个人。去年全班八个人，七个人被评为技术能手，一个人受到奖励。
    七年了，在这个不平凡的道路上，既哺吮着雨露，也经受过风霜。“红领巾”、共青团员、共产党员，记载着这孩子在政治上所走过的道路；学生、水兵、班长，标志着他在战斗生活中的成长。出色的发明创造证明了“小海军”具有卓越的才能，而实际斗争正是促进了他才华的发展。实际工作的需要，已经“逼着”这个只有初二程度的“小海军”全部学完了高中数理化课程，现在，“小海军”也正准备着用他已经学得的音周知识，创造一个代替耳朵的听测器哩。
