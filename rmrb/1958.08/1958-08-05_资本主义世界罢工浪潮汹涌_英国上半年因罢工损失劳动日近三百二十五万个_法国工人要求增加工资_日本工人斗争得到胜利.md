Xinhua News Agency reports: In the capitalist world, which is currently impacted by an economic crisis, a wave of strikes is surging.

The British Labor Department announced on the 30th that 1.2 million workdays were lost in Britain due to strikes in June. In the first six months of this year, nearly 3.25 million workdays were lost in Britain due to strikes.

French electrical and gas workers responded to the call of four trade union organizations, including the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), Workers' Force (FO), and the General Confederation of Executives (CGC), by holding a protest day on July 29 to protest de Gaulle's refusal to meet their demands for wage increases for gas and electrical workers.

Most power plants, distribution stations, gas factories, and offices in Paris and the provinces stopped work to hold rallies and petition the factory management and government public utilities departments.

In Saint-Denis, Clichy, Vitry, Issy-les-Moulineaux, Gennevilliers, and the southern districts of Paris, workers held short strikes.

In Rouen, workers from three power plants and coking plants sent delegations to petition the provincial government and factory management.

Two million tenant farmers and agricultural workers in the Italian regions of Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, and Emilia announced a 24-hour strike on the 1st. The strikers demanded revisions to collective labor contracts and guarantees of trade union freedom.

The strike struggle of approximately 9,200 workers from seven mines of the Sumitomo Coal Mining Company in Japan, who were demanding summer allowances, has achieved victory. The Japan Coal Miners' Union issued instructions to end the strike this morning.

The strike began on July 18. The workers originally demanded a summer allowance of 26,000 yen per person from the company. After multiple rounds of bargaining, the company agreed to pay 21,000 yen per person.

According to Kyodo News, due to the strike, these coal mines reduced coal production by 100,800 tons, and the company suffered losses of 330 million yen.
