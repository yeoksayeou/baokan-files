　　Practical and Mass-Oriented
　　-- An Introduction to the 16th Issue of "Study" Magazine
   The 16th issue of "Study" magazine has been published in advance. This issue dedicates four-fifths of its content to reporting on the situation of the Great Leap Forward in theoretical work.

    Amidst the Great Leap Forward in production, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres for studying theory has generally surged. The article "Aiming at Targets, Studying Theory" introduces the situation and preliminary experiences of millions of workers and peasants in Heilongjiang Province studying Chairman Mao's works and other theoretical books. "How Do Cadres in Miluo Township Study and Apply Materialist Dialectics?" uses many specific examples to illustrate how township cadres break superstitions and learn to apply the law of the unity of opposites and materialist dialectics in practical work and daily life. The article "The Workers' and Peasants' Lecturer Groups in Wuxi City" demonstrates that workers and peasants can deliver "vivid Marxist-Leninist reports that combine theory with practice."

    Due to the needs of objective development, the scope of running Party schools has greatly expanded. Now, not only do the Central Committee, provincial and municipal Party committees, prefectural committees, and county committees run Party schools, but townships also run Party schools, and some townships even run branch schools. "Party Schools Established in Every Township in Qingyuan County" explains the role of township-run Party schools in meeting the learning needs of the vast rural Party members and rapidly improving their communist consciousness. "A Township Branch School" introduces the experience of Pinghu Township in Jishui County, Jiangxi Province, in piloting a rural branch school. This school implements the principle of integrating politics, technology, and culture, with politics taking precedence, and conducts teaching in conjunction with current work and ideological problems and practical issues in production, thereby improving the political and ideological level of Party members and promoting production and work. The article "Teacher-Student Challenge" introduces the vivid scene of the Jiangxi Provincial Party School using the methods of mass airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates to conduct theoretical education.

    Another new phenomenon on the theoretical front is the blossoming of Red-Expert schools everywhere. This is a new type of school with a communist style. The article "Henan Vigorously Establishes Red-Expert Schools" introduces the situation and experiences of various places in Henan in establishing Red-Expert schools. The experience of Henan Province is that: to run Red-Expert schools, it is necessary to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas; it is necessary to rely on the masses to ensure that running Red-Expert schools meets the needs of production and work; it is necessary to combine learning with the Party's central work and production labor; and, more importantly, it is necessary to implement the principle of the secretary taking command, the whole Party participating, grasping ideology and organization, conducting inspections and evaluations, and promoting each other. "Tuozi Store Township Red-Expert University" and "Red-Expert Schools Blossom Everywhere in Longxi, Fujian" introduce the experience of township-run Red-Expert schools. (Gu Yue)

　　面向实际，面向群众
　　——16期“学习”杂志简介
   “学习”杂志第十六期提前出版。这期以五分之四的篇幅报道了理论工作大跃进的一些情况。
    在生产大跃进的形势下，广大的工农群众和基层干部学习理论的热情普遍高涨。“有的放矢，学习理论”一文，介绍了黑龙江省几百万工农学习毛主席著作和其他理论书刊的情况和初步经验。“汨罗乡干部是怎样学习和运用唯物辩证法的？”，通过许多具体事例，说明乡干部如何打破迷信，学会在实际工作和日常生活中运用矛盾的对立统一规律，运用唯物辩证法。“无锡市的工人、农民讲师团”一文说明，工人农民能作“生动的理论联系实际的马列主义报告”。
    由于客观形势发展的需要，举办党校的范围大为扩大。现在不光是中央、省市委、地委、县委办党校，乡里也办党校了，有的乡甚至办起了支部学校。“清远县乡乡办党校”说明了乡办党校在满足广大农村党员的学习要求、迅速提高党员共产主义觉悟方面的作用。“一个乡支部学校”介绍了江西吉水县平湖乡试办农村支部学校的经验。这所学校实行政治、技术、文化三者合一、而以政治为主的方针，结合当前工作和生产中的思想问题和实际问题进行教学，提高了党员的政治思想水平，推动了生产和工作。“师生擂台”一文，介绍了江西省委中级党校运用大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方法，进行理论教育的生动景象。
    理论战线上的另一个新气象，是红专学校遍地开花。这是一种具有共产主义风格的新型的学校。“河南大办红专学校”一文介绍了河南各地创办红专学校的情况和经验。河南省的经验是：举办红专学校必须破除迷信，解放思想，同右倾保守思想作斗争；必须依靠群众，使办红专学校符合生产和工作的需要；必须把学习同党的中心工作和生产劳动结合起来；更重要的是，必须实行书记挂帅，全党动手，抓思想抓组织，检查评比，互相促进。“驼子店乡红专大学”、“福建龙溪干部红专学校遍地开花”介绍了乡办红专学校的经验。（谷月）
