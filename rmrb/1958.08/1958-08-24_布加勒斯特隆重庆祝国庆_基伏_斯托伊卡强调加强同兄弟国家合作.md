　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 22nd: A grand meeting celebrating the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Romania was held in Bucharest on the evening of the 22nd.

　　Romanian Workers' Party and state leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, Maurer, and others attended the celebration meeting. Representatives from all walks of life and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Romania also attended. The Chinese women labor model group led by Jiu Lan, which is currently visiting Romania, also participated in the celebration meeting.

　　Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, delivered a report at the meeting, detailing Romania's construction achievements over the past fourteen years. He said that since liberation, Romania's industry has developed rapidly. In 1957, the output of the machinery manufacturing industry increased sixfold compared to 1938. Compared with 1948, electricity increased by 7.4 times, oil doubled, and the chemical industry increased sevenfold. In terms of per capita output of major industrial sectors, in 1938, each person only had 8.5 kilograms of iron, 18.2 kilograms of steel, and 181 kilograms of coal. By 1957, this had increased to an average of 38.5 kilograms of iron, 48.5 kilograms of steel, and 395 kilograms of coal per person. As of July 1, 1958, 46% of the country's farmers and more than half of the agricultural land had joined the socialist agricultural sector. The achievements of agricultural collectivization have made more and more farmers trust the Party's policy of socialist transformation of agriculture.

　　Speaking about the living standards of the working people, Chivu Stoica pointed out that phenomena such as unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy have disappeared from Romania. Now they eat well and dress well. Compared with 1948, the consumption of meat has increased by 2.2 times, cooking oil by 3.3 times, sugar by 2.6 times, and cotton fabrics and clothing by more than two times. From 1950 to 1957, the real wages of workers increased by 49%. During this period, 2.5 million square meters of housing were built in cities and areas with concentrated workers. The new houses built in the countryside during the first five-year plan could form four hundred new villages. There are now 225 hospitals, 2,000 clinics, and 19,500 health stations in the countryside.

　　He said that Romania's cultural and educational undertakings have also developed rapidly. At present, the number of middle and primary schools in the country has increased from 13,865 in 1938 to 16,000. Technical schools and vocational schools have increased from 366 in 1938 to 628 in 1957.

　　Chivu Stoica talked about the need for the Romanian people to continue to heighten their vigilance due to the existence of imperialist aggressive blocs and domestic exploiting classes. He said that attention should be paid to protecting socialist ownership, strengthening the Party's leadership, Party discipline, and Party unity, closely connecting with the masses, and carrying out a resolute struggle against the influence of bourgeois ideology. He also particularly emphasized the great significance of criticizing modern revisionism. Subsequently, Chivu Stoica spoke about the construction achievements of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, and the great significance of the unity of the socialist camp. He said that cooperation with socialist countries and the multifaceted assistance of the great Soviet Union have greatly promoted Romania's socialist construction. The Romanian government will devote all its efforts to developing mutual assistance and cooperation with socialist countries. He said that the enemy is trying to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, but their slanders have long been shattered against the copper walls and iron bastions of this unity.

    基伏·斯托伊卡强调加强同兄弟国家合作
    新华社布加勒斯特22日电　庆祝罗马尼亚解放十四周年大会22日晚在布加勒斯特举行。
    参加庆祝大会的有罗马尼亚工人党和国家领导人乔治乌—德治、基伏·斯托伊卡、毛雷尔等。此外还有各界代表和各国驻罗马尼亚的外交使节。目前正在罗马尼亚访问的中国妇女劳动模范九兰组也参加了庆祝大会。
    罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡在会上作了报告，详细地介绍了罗马尼亚十四年来的建设成就。他说，解放以后，罗马尼亚的工业获得了迅速的发展。1957年机器制造业的产量比1938年增长了六倍。同1948年相比，电力增加了七点四倍，石油增长了二倍，化学工业增长了七倍。主要工业部门的产品在按人口平均计算方面，1938年每人只有铁八点五公斤、钢十八点二公斤、煤一百八十一公斤。到1957年，就增长到平均每人有铁三十八点五公斤，钢四十八点五公斤，煤三百九十五公斤。到1958年7月1日，全国有46％的农户和一半以上的农业用地参加了社会主义农业部门。农业合作化的成就，使越来越多的农民信任党的农业的社会主义改造政策。
    在谈到劳动人民的生活时，基伏·斯托伊卡指出，失业、贫困、文盲等现象在罗马尼亚已经一去不复返了。现在他们吃的好、穿的好。如果和1948年比，肉的消费量增长了二点二倍、食油三点三倍、糖二点六倍、棉织品和服装二倍以上。1950年到1957年间，工人的实际工资增加了49％。这期间在城市和工人集中的地方建造了二百五十万平方公尺的住宅。第一个五年计划中在农村建起了的新房屋可组成四百个新村。在农村里现在有二百二十五所医院，两千个诊疗所和一万九千五百个卫生站。
    他说，罗马尼亚的文化教育事业也获得迅速发展。目前，全国的中、小学校已由1938年的一万三千八百六十五所发展到一万六千所。技术学校和职业学校由1938年的三百六十六所发展到1957年的六百二十八所。
    基伏·斯托伊卡谈到由于帝国主义侵略集团和国内剥削阶级的存在，需要罗马尼亚人民继续提高警惕。他说，应该注意保护社会主义所有制，加强党的领导、党的纪律和党的团结，紧密联系群众、并且要和资产阶级思想影响进行坚决的斗争。他还特别强调批判现代修正主义的重大意义。随后，基伏·斯托伊卡在讲话中谈到了苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的建设成就和社会主义阵营各国团结的伟大意义。他说，同社会主义国家的合作以及伟大苏联的多方面的帮助，大大地促进了罗马尼亚的社会主义建设。罗马尼亚政府将全力地发展同社会主义国家的互助合作。他说，敌人企图破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，但是他们的造谣中伤早已经在这种团结的铜墙铁壁面前碰得粉碎了。
