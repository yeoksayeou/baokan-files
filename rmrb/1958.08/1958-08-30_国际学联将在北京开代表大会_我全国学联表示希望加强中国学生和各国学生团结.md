　　Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Regarding the International Student Union's Fifth Congress being held in Beijing, this reporter interviewed the person in charge of the All-China Students' Federation. This person said that the International Student Union's Executive Committee, which convened in Leipzig this January, decided to accept the invitation from the All-China Students' Federation to hold the International Student Union's Fifth Congress in Beijing from September 4th to 13th. The main agenda of this congress will include:
    (1) The development of the international student movement, and the International Student Union's and student organizations' contributions to safeguarding student interests and promoting international student cooperation.
    (2) The establishment of five subcommittees to discuss the following issues respectively: (1) The role of students in defending peace; (2) Student anti-colonial activities and the efforts of students from newly independent countries to participate in national construction and eliminate the remnants of colonialism; (3) Student activities to fight for educational reform, defend student interests, and improve living and learning conditions; (4) Student activities in culture, academics, travel, and sports; (5) Student activities in publishing and journalism.
    (3) Accepting new members.
    (4) Discussing financial reports.
    (5) Electing a new Executive Committee.
    This person also said that the formal delegates and observers participating in this congress will come from about seventy countries, totaling about two hundred and forty people. Among them are representatives of students from socialist countries, and student representatives from the vast majority of Asian, African, and Latin American countries will participate in this congress. Among the students participating in the congress, nearly half are observers who do not belong to member organizations of the International Student Union. This fact demonstrates the expansion of international student unity and the increasing prestige of the International Student Union.
    The All-China Students' Federation has already invited all the national representatives, observers, and staff participating in the congress to visit various parts of China after the meeting to understand the lives, studies, and work of Chinese students and people, as well as the great leap forward in our country's socialist construction.
    The person in charge of the All-China Students' Federation finally stated that Chinese students warmly welcome the student representatives and observers from all countries participating in the International Student Union's Fifth Congress, and hope to further strengthen the friendly unity between Chinese students and students from all countries through this congress.
