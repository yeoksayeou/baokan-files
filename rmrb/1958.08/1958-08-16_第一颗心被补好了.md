　　The First Heart Was Repaired
　　I am the first patient at Shanghai First Medical College Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital to have successful heart surgery. For several years, heart disease tormented me greatly. This past April, I finally got rid of the illness that had plagued me since childhood.
　　In 1955, I returned to China from Thailand and went to Caoyang Middle School in Shanghai. I had a great passion for learning and planned to dedicate my youth to the socialist construction of the motherland. However, my congenital heart disease relapsed soon after, seriously affecting my studies and work. After the school found out, they immediately sent me to the hospital for treatment. I thought that in the past, many doctors abroad were helpless in the face of my condition, and this time there would be no hope either. But this time, the examination at Zhongshan Hospital was beyond my expectations. After detailed diagnosis by the internal medicine, radiology, and surgery departments, it was determined to be an "atrial septal defect," which required surgery to be cured. At that time, I was both happy and afraid.
　　After the surgery, the doctors carefully checked my condition, and the nurses took care of me meticulously, comforting me and giving me nutritious food. Sometimes I felt empty, but I didn't want to eat anything, and the nurses would always kindly advise me to eat more, even gently feeding the food into my mouth. With the kind care of the doctors and nurses, my body slowly recovered.
　　During my illness, I received many letters of sympathy and congratulations from all over the country; the Party branch secretary, principal, teachers, and students from the school also often came to see me, which gave me great comfort and encouragement.
　　Now, my body is almost recovered. I sincerely thank the Party for saving my life and express my heartfelt gratitude to the doctors and nurses of Zhongshan Hospital.

　　第一颗心被补好了
    我是上海市第一医学院附属中山医院心脏开刀成功的第一个病员。几年来，心脏病折磨得我好苦。今年4月我才摆脱了从小就缠绕在我身上的病魔。
    1955年我由泰国归国，到上海市曹杨中学念书，对学习抱着满腔热情，准备将来为祖国的社会主义建设贡献出自己的青春。但是不久我的先天性心脏病复发了，严重地影响了我的学习和工作。学校知道以后，立即送我到医院看病。我想，以前在海外时，许多医生在我的面前都束手无策，这次也不会有希望。可是，这次到中山医院查病却出于我的意料之外，经过内科、放射科、外科详细诊断，确定是“心房间隔缺损”，必须施行手术才能治好。当时我听了又高兴又害怕。
    施行手术以后，医生一直很认真地检查我的病，护士们也无微不至地关心我，安慰我，给我吃有营养的东西。有时我感到肚子空空的，可是又不想吃东西，护士总是亲切地劝我多吃点，还把食物轻轻地喂进我的嘴里。在医生和护士们的亲切关怀下，我的身体慢慢好起来了。
    在卧病期间，我收到许多从各地寄来的慰问信和祝贺信；学校里的党支部书记、校长、老师和同学也都经常来看我，使我得到很大的安慰和鼓舞。
    现在，我的身体快要复原了。我衷心感谢党救活了我，并且向中山医院的医师、护士们致以衷心谢意。　泰国归国华侨学生　叶任城
