　　Actors Serve as Train Attendants
　　One day, on train No. 201 on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line, I saw several new train attendants. They were the Party Branch Deputy Secretary, captain, director, actors, and stage staff from the Gansu Provincial Opera Troupe. They were always enthusiastic and amiable in serving the passengers. They also performed many short programs for the passengers, promoting the General Line.
　　That day, the carriage was particularly lively, and we had a very pleasant time. Everyone praised, "This is a literary and artistic team that serves the working people!"

　　演员担任列车员
    一天，我在兰新线的二零一次列车上，看到几个新的列车员，他们是甘肃省歌剧团的党支部副书记、队长、导演、演员和舞台工作人员。他们始终是热情、和蔼地为乘客服务，还为旅客演了许多短小节目，宣传了总路线。
    这一天，车厢里特别活跃，我们生活得非常愉快，大家赞扬说：这才是为劳动人民服务的文艺队伍。　李　凌
