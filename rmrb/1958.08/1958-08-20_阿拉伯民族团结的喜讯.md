　　Good News of Arab National Unity
　　Commentator of This Newspaper
    On August 15th, Saudi Arabian Prime Minister Faisal arrived in Cairo and held talks with President Nasser of the United Arab Republic. The leaders of the two countries reached "complete agreement" on current international issues and Middle East issues during the talks. This meeting will not only promote the unity between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic, but also play a significant role in strengthening the struggle of the Arab people against the armed aggression of the United States and Britain.
    As everyone knows, in order to realize its plan to invade the Middle East, American imperialism has tried its best to divide the unity between Arab countries and create disputes between them, so as to implement a policy of divide and conquer. However, the people of Arab countries who are eager to get rid of imperialist oppression and strive for national independence deeply know that unity among Arab countries is an important guarantee for their victory. They firmly demand the realization of the unity of Arab countries. Especially when the US and British troops occupied Lebanon and Jordan and threatened other Arab countries, the desire of the Arab people to unite became even stronger. The newly born Republic of Iraq first established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Republic and signed a joint defense agreement. In the face of the open armed aggression against Arab countries by US and British imperialism, the Saudi Arabian government announced a ban on American aircraft from crossing Saudi Arabian airspace and using the Dhahran base. In early August, Amir, Vice President and Minister of Defense of the United Arab Republic, visited Saudi Arabia and held talks on strengthening friendly relations between the two countries. Now, in the joint communique of the talks, the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic expressed their desire to enhance the friendly ties between the two countries and to "cooperate to consolidate the foundation of Arab nationalism based on the principles of non-alignment and positive neutralism." The strengthening of friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic undoubtedly conforms to the wishes of the people of the two countries and the people of all Arab countries to strengthen unity against aggression.
    The joint communique of the two countries pointed out that "both countries disagree with the stationing of any foreign troops on the territory of any Arab country, and they also condemn any foreign country or several foreign countries interfering in the internal affairs of other peoples, thereby endangering world peace and security." The large-scale invasion of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British troops threatens the security of every Arab country and also threatens world peace. Therefore, the people of the Middle East and peace-loving people all over the world unanimously demand that the US and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan to eliminate the tense situation in the Middle East and consolidate world peace. However, the United States and Britain have put forward various unreasonable excuses and conditions in an attempt to continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan. On August 13th, in his speech at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, Eisenhower not only tried his best to avoid the issue of troop withdrawal, but also attempted to play political conspiracies to continue to invade Middle Eastern countries. This approach by the United States has been sternly condemned by public opinion in Arab countries. Representatives of the United Arab Republic, Fawzi, Iraqi representative Jamal, and Saudi Arabian representative Kechouri all demanded at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session that US and British troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East. The unity of Arab countries in the struggle against colonialism and in defense of national independence and Middle East peace is an important guarantee for defeating the political conspiracy of imperialism to continue its aggression in the Middle East.
    The talks between the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic are good news for strengthening the unity of Arab countries. No matter how increasingly uneasy Washington and London feel about the talks between the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic, peace-loving people all over the world are happy for the unity of Arab countries. Unity is strength, and this is even more true for the people of Arab countries.

　　阿拉伯民族团结的喜讯
　　本报评论员
    沙特阿拉伯首相费萨尔8月15日到达开罗，和阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔举行了会谈。两国领导人在会谈中就当前国际问题和中东问题，达成“完全一致”的看法。这次会谈，不仅促进了沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合共和国之间的团结，而且对于加强阿拉伯各国人民反对美英武装侵略的斗争也将有很大的作用。
    谁都知道，美国帝国主义为了实现其侵略中东的计划，曾竭力分化阿拉伯各国之间的团结，在各国之间制造纷争，以便实行各个击破。但是，渴望摆脱帝国主义压迫、争取民族独立的阿拉伯各国人民深深知道，阿拉伯各国之间的团结是他们取得胜利的一个重要保证。他们坚决要求实现阿拉伯国家的团结。特别是在美英军队侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦，并威胁着其他阿拉伯国家的时候，阿拉伯各国人民要求团结的愿望更为强烈了。新生的伊拉克共和国，首先和阿拉伯联合共和国建立了外交关系并且签订了共同防御协定。沙特阿拉伯政府在美英帝国主义公然对阿拉伯国家进行武装侵略的情况下，宣布禁止美国飞机越过沙特阿拉伯领空和使用达兰基地。8月初，阿拉伯联合共和国副总统兼国防部长阿密尔访问了沙特阿拉伯，就密切两国友好关系问题进行了会谈。现在，沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合共和国的领导人在会谈公报中表示要增强两国之间的友好联系，并要“共同合作来巩固以不承担义务和积极中立主义为原则的阿拉伯民族主义基础”。沙特阿拉伯和阿联两国友好关系的加强，无疑是符合两国人民和阿拉伯各国人民加强团结反对侵略的愿望的。
    两国会谈公报指出，“两国都不同意任何外国军队驻在任何阿拉伯国家的土地上，它们还谴责任何一个外国或几个外国干涉其他人民的内政，从而使世界和平和安全遭到危险的行为。”美英军队大规模地侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁着每一个阿拉伯国家的安全，并使世界和平也受到了威胁。因此，中东人民和全世界爱好和平人民一致要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，以消除中东紧张局势，并巩固世界和平。但是，美英两国却提出了种种无理借口和条件，力图继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦。8月13日，艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急会议的发言中，不但尽力回避撤军问题，而且企图玩弄政治阴谋，继续侵略中东国家。美国这种做法遭到了阿拉伯各国舆论的严正斥责。阿拉伯联合共和国代表法齐、伊拉克代表贾迈尔和沙特阿拉伯代表凯舒里在联大紧急特别会议上都要求美英军队立即撤出中东。阿拉伯国家在反对殖民主义和维护民族独立和中东和平的斗争中团结一致，是击破帝国主义继续侵略中东的政治阴谋的重要保证。
    沙特阿拉伯和阿联领导人的会谈，是阿拉伯各国加强团结的一个喜讯。不管华盛顿和伦敦方面对于沙特阿拉伯和阿联领导人的会谈如何越来越感到不安，全世界爱好和平人民都为阿拉伯国家的团结而高兴。团结就是力量，这对阿拉伯各国人民来说更其如此。
