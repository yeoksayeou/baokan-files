Xinhua News Agency, August 9th:

    TASS issued a statement on August 8th saying that the Swiss government's decision to arm the Swiss army with nuclear weapons is incompatible with its policy of neutrality, because this decision objectively intensifies the nuclear arms race and further exacerbates the international situation.

    The Swiss government's decision was announced on July 11th, and it also instructed the military department to prepare a report and corresponding recommendations for submission to the Federal Council for discussion.

    TASS's statement said that by equipping its army with nuclear weapons, Switzerland poses a threat to the security of other European countries. The Swiss government has essentially included its country in the range of countries using nuclear weapons. Therefore, Switzerland's permanent neutrality and its existence as a country are subject to serious danger.

    The statement continued that the Swiss government's decision creates more difficulties for solving many important international issues (including the prohibition of nuclear weapons and their testing, the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Europe, general disarmament, etc.). In addition, the Swiss government's decision has a certain impact on those participating countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that still oppose the establishment of American nuclear and rocket weapon bases on their territory. Therefore, it is no accident that the Swiss government's decision has received the best response in some countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially the United States and West Germany.

    The statement pointed out that the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons require a lot of material resources. Because the Swiss government has made the decision to acquire nuclear weapons, regardless of its will and wishes, this may lead to weakening Switzerland's economic and political independence, and reliance on foreign aid.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet Union has stated more than once that it has respected and continues to respect Switzerland's permanent neutrality. Soviet leaders have expressed their belief that the Swiss government can reconsider the serious responsibility it has undertaken by deciding to arm its army with nuclear weapons, so as not to realize it. Soviet leaders also hope that the Swiss government can promote the cause of maintaining peace and support the proposal to prohibit the production and testing of nuclear weapons.

    永久中立国竟要原子武装
    塔斯社发表声明对瑞士提出批评
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社8日发表声明说，瑞士政府关于以原子武器武装瑞士军队的决定是同中立政策不相容的，因为这个决定客观上是在加剧原子军备竞赛和使国际局势进一步尖锐化。
    瑞士政府的这个决定是在7月11日宣布的，它并且责成军事部拟定报告和相应的建议，以便提交联邦议会讨论。
    塔斯社的声明说，由于瑞士以原子武器装备自己的军队，它便对其他欧洲国家的安全造成威胁。瑞士政府实质上已经把自己的国家包括到使用原子武器的国家范围中去，因此，瑞士的永久中立和它作为一个国家的存在都遭受到严重的危险。
    声明接着说，瑞士政府的决定对解决许多重要国际问题（包括禁止核武器和它的试验、建立欧洲无原子地区、普遍裁减军备等等）造成更多的困难。此外，瑞士政府对北大西洋公约组织中那些仍然反对在本国境内设置美国的原子武器和火箭武器基地的参加国产生了一定影响。因此，瑞士政府的决定在北大西洋公约组织的某些国家，特别是美国和西德得到最好的反应，这并不是偶然的。
    声明指出生产以及取得原子武器，需要拿出大量的物力。由于瑞士政府作出取得原子武器的决定，不管它的意志和愿望如何，这就可能导致削弱瑞士的经济和政治独立，而依靠外国的援助。
    声明最后说，苏联不只一次地声明过，它过去和现在都尊重瑞士的永久中立。苏联领导人士表示相信，瑞士政府能再一次考虑由于决定以原子武器武装本国军队而承担的严重责任，从而不去实现它。苏联领导人士还希望，瑞士政府能促进维护和平的事业，并且支持关于禁止生产和试验原子武器的建议。
