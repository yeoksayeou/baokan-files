Beside the stove, under the lamplight, I teach Mom to read.
Mom holds the baby in her arms, a smiling squint in her eyes with the book in her hand.
I say, "Mom, don't laugh, remember the words you learned last night."
Mom laughs heartily upon hearing this, "Where are you going with this, little girl! Although Mom is old, learning to read isn't so bad. These four are ‘Spring plowing production,’ those four are ‘Fertilizer accumulation plan.’"

　　我教妈妈学文化锅灶旁，灯光下，我教妈妈学文化。妈妈怀抱小宝宝，手拿书本眯眯笑。我说妈妈你别笑，昨晚认的字可记牢，妈妈一听笑哈哈，“小丫子说的哪里话！妈妈虽然年纪大，学习文化不算差。这四个是‘春耕生产’，那四个是‘积肥计划’。”
