    Chengdu, August 24th (reporter Shao Tingjun, Liu Zongchong): Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretaries are at the forefront of steel and machinery industry production, directing.
    Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Li Dazhang, Liao Zhigao, Chen Gang, Xu Mengxia, and others, have recently personally gone to the forefront of steel and machinery industry production, delving into factory workshops to inspect and help various localities solve major industrial problems.
    In early August, Li Jingquan inspected steel mills, copper mills, and machinery factories in Emei and Meishan counties in the Leshan Special Zone, discovering a series of issues worthy of attention throughout the province. For example, the layout of steel production in some areas of Emei County lacks foresight and thorough consideration, failing to take into account resources and transportation conditions, which should be corrected in a timely manner. Preparations for the expansion of steel mills should begin now in order to expand steel production. The potential for copper production in various localities is still great, and preparations for expanding production should be made immediately. After visiting the Hongxing Iron Factory in Meishan County, Li Jingquan praised the factory's communist style of self-reliance in solving the problem of iron and copper smelting equipment, and guided the factory to summarize their experience. This factory has only twenty-two old machine tools, but in a few months it has manufactured thirty-eight new products, including iron-smelting blast furnaces, steam engines, automatic water pumps, high-pressure water pumps, water turbines, and blowers, solving the problem of iron and copper smelting equipment through self-reliance. This experience has been spread throughout the province, effectively promoting the production speed of the province's steel and machinery industries.
    Secretaries Liao Zhigao and Chen Gang went to Luxian County and Xuyong County in the Luzhou Special Zone, focusing on inspecting steel production and agricultural tool production. The construction of indigenous blast furnaces in the Luzhou Special Zone is progressing rapidly, but few have been put into production, and those that have been put into production are not operating normally. The two secretaries found that the main reason for this situation was that cadres had a tendency to emphasize capital construction and neglect production. They immediately instructed various localities to correct this. In addition, Secretary Chen Gang also found that various localities in the region had created many valuable experiences, but they had not been summarized and promoted. He pointed out that the local Party committees should summarize and promote them in a timely manner. For example, after receiving instructions from this secretary, the Luzhou Prefectural Party Committee held a telephone conference of county Party committee secretaries, requiring all localities to not only grasp capital construction but also grasp production, and to launch a mass production upsurge within a limited time on the basis of a mass furnace construction upsurge.
    Nanchang, August 24th (reporter Liu Guanghui): At a broadcast mobilization meeting held on the evening of the 20th, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all localities to resolutely complete the steelmaking and ironmaking plans.
    According to incomplete statistics up to early August, Jiangxi Province has built more than 4,000 large and small indigenous blast furnaces, and more than 500 of them have been producing iron normally, producing 20,000 tons of iron for the country. In terms of steelmaking, the province has more than 400 steelmaking furnaces under construction, and 25 factories (cooperatives) in Nanchang City alone have produced steel.
    After a large number of indigenous blast furnaces were built in Jiangxi Province, the iron output rate was low and the cost was high for a time because the smelting technology and fuel problems were not resolved. Some furnaces produced one batch and then stopped, and many furnaces could not even produce iron. In response to this situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels immediately organized forces to overcome the major hurdles of smelting technology and fuel, so that the indigenous blast furnaces could produce iron normally.
    In order to break through the technical barrier, local prefectural and county party secretaries personally took charge of steel, vigorously engaged in steel "experimental fields," and used their experience gained to promote on-site meetings universally. A batch of indigenous blast furnaces built in Wanzai County, Nanchang Prefecture, in July could not produce iron. County Party Secretary Cui You led six industrial cadres to the mountainous area 90 miles from the city to establish a steel "experimental field." After several experiments, they found that the reason for the failure to produce iron was the inaccurate ingredients and insufficient wind power. They changed the original furnace into a small standard furnace, increased the wind power, and adjusted the composition of the ingredients. In this way, they smelted nineteen batches in a row, and each furnace produced iron, producing 200 jin of iron in one day and one night. The county party committee urgently convened a meeting of county magistrates and promoted this experience throughout the county. All the indigenous blast furnaces quickly switched to normal production. By establishing steel experimental fields, this prefecture broke through the smelting technology barrier, so that all 364 indigenous blast furnaces in the prefecture that could not produce steel originally flowed out of molten iron.
    At present, various localities in Jiangxi are trying to find fuel for ironmaking, and many areas have found fuel that can fully meet their needs.
    This newspaper reports that the Secretariat of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency telephone conference on the evening of the 21st, requiring Party committees at all levels to immediately take measures, overcome all difficulties, and push the great leap forward in industrial production to a new peak.
    In order to effectively promote industrial production and ensure the completion of the annual steel production plan without any discount, the meeting announced ten emergency measures decided by the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, emphasizing taking steel as the key link to drive the entire industrial production. The allocation and use of all manpower and material resources, such as labor, raw materials, machinery and equipment, transportation vehicles, etc., should be arranged with steel production and the production of metallurgical equipment as the center. The work of all sectors of the national economy in the province should also be subordinate to this central task, and should not "fight arms" or create contradictions with steel production. The Secretariat also emphasized that mining, coking, and manufacturing refractory materials should be arranged in a comprehensive manner and allocated in a unified manner around steel production. The materials needed for external cooperation in various localities should be approved by the Provincial Party Committee and included in the unified plan. Work such as basic construction and production planning should be closely integrated with current production. Everything should be subordinate to production, promote production, pay attention to the actual effect of production, and immediately reverse the current tendency in industrial production leadership to only focus on long-term planning and basic construction while ignoring production. The Secretariat required leaders at all levels to strive for a large-scale harvest and high-yield production of steel, copper, and aluminum, to carry out a competition and comparison of planting red flags and launching "satellites" between regions and between factories and mines, and to use the organizational and leadership experience of the agricultural great leap forward to promote the industrial great leap forward.
    At present, the industrial production leadership organization directly led by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Chi Biqing, Secretary of the Secretariat, has also been formed and has begun its tense work. Local prefectural and municipal party committees have held emergency meetings overnight to study specific issues of accelerating steel production.
    Fuzhou, August 24th (reporter): The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is vigorously grasping steel production. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference of prefectural (municipal) and county Party committee secretaries on the 21st, deploying a magnificent steel production and capital construction movement throughout the province. At this meeting, the Provincial Party Committee required Party committees at all levels to concentrate greater efforts to lead steel production, to ensure that steel "satellites" go into the sky, and to immediately organize a 500,000-strong steel production army to go up the mountains and down to the factories to carry out coal mining, mining, steelmaking, and ironmaking movements as much and as quickly as possible.
    The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that at present, the production of indigenous iron in Fujian has made significant progress, and the speed of furnace construction has accelerated, but fewer and fewer furnaces are maintaining normal production. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the main reason why the steel industry cannot rapidly enter large-scale production is that some leaders and management cadres have developed fear of difficulties and a wait-and-see mentality. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that the province's task of 300,000 tons of iron and 50,000 tons of steel this year must be guaranteed to be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. In addition to ensuring that all existing furnaces are put into production within five days, 125 sets of small steelmaking converters will be built by the end of September, and efforts will be made to increase steel production from the original plan of 50,000 tons this year to 100,000 tons.
    The Provincial Party Committee especially emphasized that steel production must be personally grasped by the first secretary of the Party Committee, and must be grasped immediately.
    Xining, August 24th (reporter): In order to ensure the completion of this year's steel, iron, and copper production tasks, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting on the 21st and 22nd to review the production of steel, iron, and copper, and to solve important problems in smelting. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Guosheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee.
    According to the reports from various prefectures, counties, cities, and the Qaidam Basin, most areas have actively taken action. As of the time of the meeting, more than 1,700 indigenous blast furnaces and indigenous low furnaces had been built throughout the province, and more than 500 had been put into production. The inspection also found that the main responsible persons in some counties and cities have not really grasped steel production, and the secretaries have not taken the lead. For example, Xining City has better conditions than any other region, but because the municipal party committee secretary did not grasp it tightly and handed over the work of smelting steel to a general cadre, the task was completed very poorly.
    Zhang Guosheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, instructed Party committees at all levels to put politics in command, Party secretaries to personally grasp steel, fully mobilize the masses, form a national movement for steel production, not let go of a single second of time, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of steel production tasks.

    青海强调抓钢铁不要放过一分一秒
    本报成都24日电　记者邵挺军、刘宗崇报道：四川省委书记到钢铁机械工业生产最前线指挥。
    中共四川省委第一书记李井泉，书记李大章、廖志高、陈刚、许梦侠等，最近都亲自到钢铁机械工业生产最前线深入工厂车间检查帮助各地解决工业中的重大问题。
    李井泉在8月上旬到乐山专区的峨眉、眉山等县察看了钢铁厂、铜厂和机械厂，发现了一系列值得全省重视的问题。如峨眉县有的地区钢铁生产布局上缺乏远见和周密考虑，没有照顾到资源和交通条件，应及时改正。现在就要着手安排钢铁厂的扩建工作，以便扩大钢铁生产。各地铜的生产潜力还大，应即扩大生产的准备工作。李井泉在眉山县红星铁工厂参观后表扬了该厂自力更生解决炼铁炼铜设备的共产主义风格，并指导该厂总结了他们的经验。这个厂只有二十二台破旧的机床，但在几个月内却制造出来炼铁高炉、蒸汽机、自动水泵、高压水泵、水轮机、鼓风机等三十八种新产品，自力更生解决炼铁炼铜设备。这一经验已在全省传播，有效的推动全省钢铁和机械工业的生产速度。
    廖志高书记和陈刚书记到泸州专区的泸县和叙永县等地，着重察看了钢铁生产和农具生产。泸州专区土高炉基建工作进度很快，但投入生产的不多，少数投入生产的生产也不正常。这两位书记发现造成这种情况的主要原因是干部思想上有重基建轻生产的倾向，当即指示各地纠正。另外陈刚书记还发现该区各地创造了许多宝贵经验，但没有总结推广。他就指出要当地党委及时总结推广。如泸州地委接到这位书记指示后，召开了县委书记电话会议，要求各地既要抓紧基建又要抓紧生产，在群众性的建炉高潮基础上限期掀起群众性的生产高潮。
    本报南昌24日电　记者刘光辉报道：中共江西省委在20日晚召开的广播动员大会上，号召各地坚决完成炼钢炼铁计划。
    据至8月上旬的不完全统计，江西省已建成大、小土高炉四千多座，有五百多座已正常出铁，为国家生产出铁两万吨；在炼钢方面，全省已有四百多座炼钢炉正在紧张动工兴建，仅南昌市就有二十五个厂（社）炼出了钢。
    江西省大批土高炉建成后，曾一度因为冶炼技术和燃料问题没有解决，出铁率低、成本高。有的出一炉停一炉，甚至还有许多炉子炼不出铁来。针对这种情况，中共江西省委和各级党委便立即组织力量大破冶炼技术和燃料大关，使土高炉正常出铁。
    为了突破技术关，各地委、县委书记亲自挂帅抓钢铁，大搞钢铁“试验田”，并把他们取得的经验运用现场会议普遍推广。南昌专区万载县在7月份建成的一批土高炉炼不出铁来，县委书记崔有便带领六个工业干部到离城九十里的山区建立钢铁“试验田”。经过几次试验，摸到不出铁的原因是配料不精确和风力不足以后，把原来的炉子改成一种小标炉，加大了风力，并调整了配料的成分，这样接连炼了十九炉，炉炉炼出了铁，一天一夜产铁二百斤。县委紧急召开县长会议，把这个经验在全县推广后，全部土高炉很快转入了正常生产。这个专区通过建立钢铁试验田的办法，突破了冶炼技术关，使全区三百六十四个原来炼不出钢铁来的土高炉都流出了铁水。
    目前江西各地正在想方设法寻找炼铁的燃料，许多地区已经找到了能充分满足需要的燃料。
    本报讯　中共山西省委书记处21日晚上召开紧急电话会议，要求各级党委立即采取措施，克服一切困难，把工业生产大跃进推向新的高峰。
    为了有力地推动工业生产，保证不折不扣地完成全年钢铁生产计划，会上宣布省委书记处决定的十项紧急措施，强调以钢为纲，带动整个工业生产。一切人力和物力的调配和使用，如劳动力、原材料、机械设备、运输工具等等，都要以钢铁生产和制造冶金设备的生产为中心来作安排。全省整个国民经济各部门的工作，也要服从这一中心任务，不准和钢铁生产“抗膀子”，闹矛盾。书记处还强调采矿、炼焦、制造耐火材料等，都要围绕钢铁生产，通盘安排、统一调配。各地对外协作需要交换的物资，要经过省委批准，纳入统一计划。关于基本建设、生产规划等工作要和当前生产紧密结合。一切服从生产推动生产，讲究生产实效，立即扭转目前工业生产领导上只顾搞远景规划和基本建设而忽视生产的倾向。书记处要求各级领导努力争取钢铁铜铝大面积丰收和高额丰产，开展地区与地区、厂矿与厂矿插红旗放“卫星”的评比竞赛，运用农业大跃进的组织领导经验，推动工业大跃进。
    现在，中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳、书记处书记池必卿直接领导下的工业生产领导机构也已组成，开始紧张工作。各地委、市委都连夜召开紧急会议，研究加快钢铁生产的具体问题。
    本报福州24日电　中共福建省委大抓钢铁生产。中共福建省委在21日召开地（市）县委书记电话会议，部署在全省开展一个规模壮阔的钢铁生产和基本建设运动。在这次会议上，省委要求各级党委要集中更大力量领导钢铁生产，保证钢铁“卫星”上天，要立即组织五十万钢铁生产大军上山、下厂，尽多尽快地开展挖煤、采矿、炼钢、炼铁运动。
    省委指出：目前福建土铁生产有了显著进展，建炉速度加快了，但坚持正常生产的就更少。省委认为，钢铁工业所以不能急速投入大规模生产的主要原因是部分领导干部和管理干部中产生了畏难情绪和等待、依赖思想。因此，省委提出今年全省三十万吨铁、五万吨钢的任务一定要保证提前超额完成。全省除了保证已建炉全部在五天内投入生产外，要在9月底再建炼钢小转炉一百二十五套，力争把钢的生产由原计划今年完成五万吨提高到十万吨。
    省委特别强调钢铁生产必须由党委第一书记亲自抓，而且要立即抓。
    本报西宁24日电　为确保今年钢、铁、铜生产任务的完成，中共青海省委于21、22日召开紧急会议，对钢、铁、铜的生产进行了检查，并解决冶炼工作中的重要问题。会议由省委书记处书记张国声主持。
    根据各州、县、市及柴达木盆地等地区的汇报情况看，绝大部分地区已积极地行动了起来，到开会时止，全省已建起土高炉、土低炉等一千七百多座；投入生产的有五百多座。检查中也发现了有些县、市的主要负责人还没有把钢铁生产真正抓起来，书记没有挂帅。如西宁市的条件比任何地区都好，但是由于市委书记抓得不紧，把冶炼钢铁的工作交给一个一般的干部负责，因此，任务完成得很差。
    省委书记处书记张国声指示各级党委必须政治挂帅，书记亲自动手抓钢铁，充分发动群众，把生产钢铁形成全民性的运动，不放过一分一秒的时间，确保钢铁生产任务的完成和超额完成。
