Refuting the Shameless Sophistry of the British Authorities in Hong Kong
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The grave atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong in trampling and persecuting the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and infringing upon the rights of Chinese journalists to report, have aroused increasingly strong indignation among Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon and all Chinese people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country also lodged a serious protest on August 27, demanding that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately cease these provocative acts of hostility towards the Chinese people. However, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have not yet given a positive response to the righteous condemnation of our government and people, nor have they taken effective remedial measures. Instead, on August 29, the Hong Kong Colonial Secretary issued a statement deliberately obscuring the facts, making sophistry for the Hong Kong authorities' unreasonable closure of the Chung Wah Middle School, and shamelessly denying the crimes of beating teachers, students, and Chinese journalists of this school. The British authorities in Hong Kong continue to adopt this imperialist attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people, which will only further arouse the anger of the Chinese people towards them!

The truth is by no means something that can be concealed by a ridiculous statement from the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British authorities in Hong Kong fabricated the excuse of "dangerous buildings," unreasonably and forcibly closed the Chung Wah Middle School, and dispatched armed police to commit violence. This was done under the eyes of the public. Not only were Chinese journalists present at the time, but these Chinese journalists were also subjected to insults and beatings by the Hong Kong armed police. Their reports on the scene are the most authoritative. Their written reports and the on-site photos they took irrefutably prove that the Hong Kong armed police brutally beat the unarmed teachers, students, and Chinese journalists of Chung Wah Middle School. However, the Hong Kong Colonial Secretary's statement resorted to sophistry, distorted the truth, and falsely accused the reports of these Chinese journalists as "distorting the facts and erroneous reports." This is truly a shameful act of rascality.

Precisely because the statement of the British authorities in Hong Kong attempts to cover up the atrocities and distort the truth, it cannot but be full of contradictions and unable to justify itself. The Colonial Secretary's statement said: "After they refused to leave, the police expelled some of them. Afterwards, the students were asked to leave the school building, but they refused to leave by holding hands, and the rest followed silently. Other people in the school also left silently at the request of the police." This is really an absurd statement! Since the students held hands and refused to leave, how could the others silently follow and leave silently? Since the Hong Kong authorities admitted in the statement that the Hong Kong police used "minimal force" at the time, how can they still falsely accuse the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong of "distorting the facts and erroneous reports"? Obviously, it is the British authorities in Hong Kong who are deliberately distorting the truth, not the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong.

The statement of the British authorities in Hong Kong argued that the closure of the Chung Wah Middle School was "based on building regulations, not education regulations," and that protecting personal "safety" was "the only factor in taking action." This is also a completely upside-down and disregardful of the facts. The truth of the matter is that the Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of the Chung Wah Middle School was a planned conspiracy. As early as when the British authorities in Hong Kong began to fabricate the excuse of "dangerous buildings" in an attempt to persecute the Chung Wah Middle School, the school authorities repeatedly requested the competent authorities to repair the school building, but the competent authorities deliberately delayed and ignored it. Until the Chung Wah Middle School was closed, the Hong Kong competent authorities still had not approved the school's application for repairs. This most clearly exposes the fact that it was the British authorities in Hong Kong who hindered the Chung Wah Middle School from repairing the school building, and it was also the British authorities in Hong Kong who forcibly closed the school building. Isn't this a deliberately set trap to carry out their conspiracy to close the Chung Wah Middle School?

The facts are very clear. The British authorities in Hong Kong's persecution action of forcibly closing the Chung Wah Middle School is part of its consistent implementation of a policy of deliberately undermining the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. For nine years, the British authorities in Hong Kong have used inexplicable charges such as "dangerous buildings," "the Governor dislikes it," "political activities," and "non-compliance with fire prevention equipment" to close Chinese-run schools, expel Chinese teachers, interfere with the administration of Chinese schools, and do whatever they want. What is particularly sinister is that the British authorities in Hong Kong have formulated a series of so-called education regulations, such as the "New Education Ordinance" of 1952, the "Permanent Circular" of 1953, and the "List of Approved Textbooks," in an attempt to restrict and deprive the rights of Chinese people to run schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and undermine the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The so-called "List of Approved Textbooks" announced by the British authorities in Hong Kong over the years does not allow Hong Kong schools to use textbooks published in China, and many textbooks published in Hong Kong are also prohibited from use, while the so-called textbooks published by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group and by US-Chiang agents in Hong Kong are allowed to be used in large quantities. The British authorities in Hong Kong also unreasonably prohibit the performance and arbitrarily delete and tamper with scripts written by famous Chinese writers and films made in China, while the reactionary publications of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, including Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," have never been banned by the British authorities in Hong Kong. Although the British government has recognized the People's Republic of China, it does not allow schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon to display the Chinese national flag, but allows US-Chiang agents to display the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek group in schools in Hong Kong without any interference. The British authorities in Hong Kong openly show hostility towards the education of the Chinese people in this way, and harbor and condone the political conspiracy activities of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group against New China.

In particular, since this year, the British authorities in Hong Kong's acts of persecuting and undermining the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon have developed even more blatantly. The British authorities in Hong Kong have ulterior and despicable motives in doing so. It attempts to cooperate with the US imperialist policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and create a "two Chinas" conspiracy. Recently, just as the US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique were deploying troops and creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area, the British authorities in Hong Kong also stepped up their hostile activities against the Chinese people, sending planes to invade Chinese airspace, undermining the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and persecuting the news media of Chinese people in Hong Kong. Is this accidental?

The statement of the British authorities in Hong Kong fully illustrates that the British authorities in Hong Kong are not only unwilling to abandon their policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, but are also attempting to further plan conspiracies of hostility towards the Chinese people. The statement insisted that the reports in the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong about the violence of the Hong Kong armed police were "harmful reports with incitement and distortion of facts." At the same time, the Hong Kong "South China Morning Post," speaking on behalf of the British authorities in Hong Kong, published an editorial on August 28, openly threatening and intimidating the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, clamoring about "how long the propaganda movement should be tolerated, and to what extent"! It even wants the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong to pay attention to the "dangerous consequences" that may be caused! This is even more sufficient to see where the British authorities in Hong Kong's intentions lie. Therefore, the Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon and all Chinese people should be vigilant, pay close attention to the next actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong to be hostile to the Chinese people, and resolutely carry out the struggle!

　　斥香港英国当局的无耻狡辩
　　本报评论员
    香港英国当局摧残和迫害港九中国人民的教育事业和侵犯中国新闻记者采访权利的严重暴行，已经激起了港九中国居民和全中国人民越来越强烈的愤慨。我国外交部在8月27日也提出了严重抗议，要求英国政府和香港英国当局立即停止这些敌视中国人民的挑衅行为。可是，英国政府和香港英国当局对我国政府和人民这种义正词严的谴责，至今不作正面回答和采取有效的善后措施；反在8月29日由香港辅政司发表一项故意抹煞事实真相的声明，为香港当局无理封闭中华中学的行动进行狡辩，并无耻抵赖殴打这个学校教师、学生和中国新闻记者的罪行。香港英国当局继续采取这种敌视中国人民的帝国主义态度，只会更加激起中国人民对它的愤怒！
    事实真相决不是香港英国当局一篇荒谬的声明所能掩盖得了的。香港英国当局制造“危险房屋”借口，无理强行封闭中华中学校舍，派出武装警察行凶，是在众目睽睽之下进行的。当时不仅有中国新闻记者在场，并且这些中国新闻记者也遭到了香港武装警察的殴辱，他们对现场的报道是最权威的。他们的文字报道和所拍的现场照片，都无可争辩地证明了香港武装警察对赤手空拳的中华中学教师、学生和中国新闻记者进行了野蛮的殴辱。可是，香港辅政司的声明竟然强词夺理，歪曲事实真相，反诬蔑这些中国新闻记者的报道为“歪曲事实及谬误报道”。这实在是一种可耻的无赖行径。
    正因为香港英国当局的声明是力图掩盖暴行，歪曲了事实真相，以致它不能不矛盾百出，无法自圆其说。辅政司的声明说：“当彼等拒绝离开之后，警方乃驱逐其中若干人出外。其后就请学生离开校舍，但彼等以手相连，拒绝离开，其余亦默然相随。校内其他人等，亦应警方之请，静默离开。”这真是荒谬透顶的说法！既然学生以手相连，拒绝离开，怎么其他人又会默然相随、静默离开呢？香港当局在声明中既然承认当时香港警察使用了“最小武力”，那末，怎么还能诬蔑在香港的中国报纸“歪曲事实及谬误报道”呢？显然，有意歪曲事实真相的是香港英国当局，而不是香港的中国报纸。
    香港英国当局的声明辩解说，封闭中华中学校舍，是“根据建筑法例，而非根据教育法例”，保护人身“安全”是“采取行动之唯一因素”。这同样是完全颠倒黑白，不顾事实的说法。事情的真相是，香港英国当局强行封闭中华中学校舍，完全是一种有计划的预谋。早在香港英国当局开始制造“危险房屋”的借口，企图迫害中华中学的时候，该校当局就曾一再向主管部门提出修缮校舍的要求，但是，主管部门却故意拖延，不予置理。直到中华中学校舍被封闭的时候，香港主管部门仍然没有批准这个学校进行修缮的申请。这就最清楚不过地暴露了这样一个事实：妨碍中华中学进行校舍修缮的是香港英国当局，强行封闭中华中学校舍的也是香港英国当局，这难道不是有意设置的圈套，以遂行其封闭中华中学的阴谋吗？
    事实非常清楚，香港英国当局强行封闭中华中学校舍的迫害行动，是它一贯地执行着一项蓄意摧残港九中国人民教育事业的政策的一部分。九年以来，香港英国当局利用“危险房屋”、“港督不欢喜”、“政治活动”、“防火设备不合规格”等莫名其妙的罪名，封闭中国人办的学校，驱逐中国教师，干涉中国学校的行政，为所欲为。特别险恶的是，香港英国当局曾经制订一系列的所谓教育条例，如1952年的“新教育条例”、1953年的“永久性通告”、“准用教科书名单”等，力图限制和剥夺中国人在港九办学校的权利，摧残港九中国人民的教育事业。香港英国当局历年宣布的所谓“准用教科书名单”，竟不许香港学校采用中国出版的教科书，香港出版的教科书也有许多被禁止使用，而台湾蒋介石集团出版的以及美蒋特务在香港出版的所谓教科书，却允许大量采用。对中国著名作家写的剧本，中国摄制的电影，香港英国当局也毫无道理地禁止演出和横加删节篡改，而对台湾蒋介石集团的反动出版物，包括蒋介石的“中国之命运”等在内，却从来不曾被香港英国当局禁止过。尽管英国政府承认了中华人民共和国，却不允许港九学校悬挂中国国旗，而任令美蒋特务在香港的学校悬挂蒋介石集团的旗帜，从来不加干涉。香港英国当局就是这样公然敌视中国人民的教育事业，包庇和纵容美国和蒋介石集团反对新中国的政治阴谋活动。
    特别是今年以来，香港英国当局迫害和摧残港九中国人民教育事业的行为，有了更加露骨的发展。香港英国当局这样做，抱有不可告人的卑鄙目的。它企图配合美帝国主义敌视中国人民的政策，制造“两个中国”的阴谋。最近，正当美帝国主义者和蒋介石反动集团调兵遣将，在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的时候，香港英国当局也加紧了敌视中国人民的活动，派遣飞机侵犯中国领空，摧残港九中国人民的教育事业，迫害香港中国人民的新闻事业，这难道是偶然的吗？
    香港英国当局的声明充分说明，香港英国当局不仅不肯放弃敌视中国人民的政策，并且还在企图进一步策划敌视中国人民的阴谋。声明硬说在香港的中国报纸关于香港武装警察行凶的报道是“有煽动性及歪曲事实之有害报道”。同时代表香港英国当局发言的香港“华南早报”，在8月28日发表的一篇社论中，公然威胁和恫吓在香港的中国报纸，叫嚣什么“宣传运动应当容忍多久，容忍到什么程度”！甚至要在香港的中国报纸注意可能引起“危险后果”！这就更足以看出香港英国当局的用心安在。因此，在港九的中国居民和全中国人民都应该提高警惕，密切注意香港英国当局敌视中国人民的下一步行动，坚决进行斗争！
