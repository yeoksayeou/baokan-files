From the Masses' Criticism

　　Introduction Letters Should Not Be Issued Casually
    Due to production needs, many factories have recently been recruiting apprentices. After hearing this news, some farmers have begun to blindly migrate to cities again. What is even more noteworthy is that some rural cadres not only do not stop this phenomenon, but also issue them introduction letters.
    Our country's labor force allocation is carried out in a planned way. The blind influx of farmers into cities is contrary to this principle. Moreover, those who are introduced are mostly the main labor force in rural areas. After they come to the city, not only can they not find work, but they also affect agricultural production. It is hoped that rural cadres will strengthen education for them and stop this phenomenon from continuing to occur.

### 不应该随便开介绍信

　　不应该随便开介绍信
    由于生产上的需要，最近许多工厂都在招收学徒。部分农民听到这一消息后，又开始向城市盲目流动。更值得注意的是，有些农村干部对这一现象不但不加阻止，还给他们开了介绍信。
    我们国家劳动力的调配，是有计划地进行的。农民盲目流入城市，是和这一原则相违背的。而且，被介绍的人，大都是农村的主要劳动力，他们来到城市后，不但找不到工作，还影响了农业生产。希望农村干部对他们加强教育，制止这种现象继续发生。
