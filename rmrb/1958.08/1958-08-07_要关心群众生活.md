    It is necessary to care about the lives of the masses
    Zhang Ke
    "During the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, production and work are so busy, how can there be time to manage the trivial matters of oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar?" Some cadres, when they encounter the masses raising issues related to their lives, always dismiss them with a few words. Is this approach correct? How should the relationship between production and life be handled during the Great Leap Forward? Everyone knows that the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction requires the active and enthusiastic participation of hundreds of millions of people, and requires all the people to exert their utmost efforts and strive for advancement. But how can the enthusiasm of the broad masses be mobilized? How can the enthusiasm of the masses be sustained and continuously increased? There are some differences in opinion on this issue. This difference is particularly evident in the handling of the relationship between production and life.
    Some people believe that production is so busy and work is so intense that life issues can be asked about less or not at all. Therefore, they are busy every day mobilizing, organizing, and leading the masses in production, ignoring the actual difficulties in the lives of the masses. The results of this approach can be imagined: the enthusiasm of the masses often cannot be aroused, and even if it is aroused, it cannot be sustained. Those who hold correct views on this issue believe that the more intense the production and the busier the work, the more important it is to care about the lives of the masses, and to pay attention to the actual problems in the lives of the masses at all times and places, and to find ways to solve them while grasping production. This latter approach may seem as if the cadres have not devoted all their energy and time to leading the masses in production, but in fact, it leads production to leap forward again and again. The reason is very simple: if you care about the lives of the masses and solve the difficulties in their lives, the masses will feel that you truly represent their interests, and the masses will be in a good mood, and they will be full of energy when they produce.
    The reason for this divergence is mainly that some people have set production and life against each other, and see the two as mutually contradictory. The fundamental purpose of our developing production is to improve the lives of all the people. Therefore, to improve life, we must work hard to produce. Only when production is highly developed can we fundamentally improve and improve the lives of the masses and meet the life requirements of the masses. Cadres at all levels must actively lead the production work of the masses, and should also grasp production tightly and demand strictness. However, it is wrong to neglect the current interests – life issues – when leading the masses in production – striving for long-term interests. At any time and under any conditions, appropriately satisfying the material and cultural life requirements of the masses, and solving the problems that should and can be solved in the lives of the masses as much as possible, can make the masses deeply feel the superiority of the socialist system, and thus be more energetic in striving for long-term interests – the socialist cause.
    There are also other people who only care about immediate interests and do not make long-term plans, and even cater to the excessive demands of some backward masses on life. This is also wrong, as it will affect the speed of our socialist construction.
    The correct approach should be as Chairman Mao pointed out in the article "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work": "We must not neglect or underestimate the immediate interests of the broad masses and the problems in their lives." Only when we do this will the masses "truly rally around us and enthusiastically support us."

    要关心群众生活
    张克
    “社会主义建设大跃进的时候，生产、工作这样忙，那有时间管油盐酱醋这些小事呢？”有些干部碰见群众向他们提出生活上的问题时，总是这样三言两语把群众顶了回去。这种作法对不对呢？究竟在大跃进的时候，生产和生活的关系怎么摆法才好呢？谁全知道：社会主义建设事业大跃进，需要亿万人民积极热烈地参加，需要全体人民鼓足干劲、力争上游。但是怎样才能把广大群众的干劲动员起来？怎样才能使群众的干劲持久保持并越来越高呢？对于这一问题的看法上，就有一些分歧了。这个分歧特别表现在对处理生产和生活关系这一问题上。
    有人认为生产这样忙、工作这样紧张，生活问题可以少问或者不问。于是天天忙着动员、组织、领导群众搞生产，对群众生活上的实际困难置之不理。这样作的结果是可以想像得出的，群众干劲常常鼓不起来，有的虽则鼓起来了也不能持久。在这一问题上持有正确观点的人则认为越是在生产这样紧张，工作这样忙的时候，越要关心群众生活，坚持在抓紧生产的同时，随时随地注意群众生活中实际问题，并设法解决。对后一种做法，看起来好像干部没有把全部的精力和时间用在领导群众进行生产上，其实却把生产领导得跃进又跃进。原因很简单，你关心了群众生活，解决了他们生活上的困难，群众便感到你真正是代表他们的利益的，群众心情舒畅，生产起来也就干劲冲天。
    产生这种分歧的原因，主要是有些人把生产和生活对立起来了，把两者看成是互相矛盾的了。我们发展生产的根本目的就是为了改善全体人民的生活。因此，要改善生活，只有努力生产，生产高度地发展了，才能从根本上提高和改善群众的生活，满足群众的生活要求。各级干部必须积极地领导群众的生产工作，也应该对生产抓得紧、要求严。但在领导群众生产——为长远利益奋斗时，忽视了当前利益——生活问题，就不对了。在任何时候和条件下，适当地满足群众物质文化生活的要求，尽可能地解决群众生活上应该解决而又可能解决的问题，才能使群众深刻感到社会主义制度的优越性，从而更加干劲十足地为长远利益——社会主义事业而奋斗。
    也有另外一种人，他们只顾眼前利益，不作长远打算，甚至迁就某些落后群众对生活上的过分的要求。这也是不对的，这将会影响我们建设社会主义的速度。
    正确的作法应该是毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中指出的那样：“我们对于广大群众的切身利益问题，群众的生活问题，就一点也不能疏忽，一点也不能看轻。”只有我们这样作了，群众才会“真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”
