Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th August: Xu昌 Prefecture in Henan Province joyfully reports a bumper harvest of flue-cured tobacco. This year, the 1.33 million mu of flue-cured tobacco across the region are growing better than in any previous year. Currently, large-scale harvesting and curing are underway in various localities. According to statistics from relevant departments, as of the 20th, the region has cured over 60 million jin of lower and second-priming leaves, equivalent to over 170% of last year's total output.

襄城 County, which Chairman Mao recently inspected, has 140,000 mu of tobacco fields. From late June to August 17th, it has already cured 17.5 million jin of tobacco leaves. Although this is less than one-tenth of the projected yield, it already exceeds 91.72% of the county's total output last year.

This bountiful scene has further consolidated the confidence of cadres and the masses in increasing production. To shed the "low-yield" label on tobacco leaves, they are currently conducting on-site debates through visits and comparisons, revising new leap forward targets and measures for mid- and late-stage management, striving for an even greater harvest.

　　烟叶要摘“低产”帽子
    许昌专区烤烟生长胜过往年
    新华社郑州27日电　河南省许昌专区烤烟喜告丰收。今年全区一百三十三万亩烤烟长得比过去任何一年都好。目前各地正在大量收烤。据有关部门统计，截至20日止，全区已炕脚烟和二棚烟六千多万斤，相当于去年总产量的170％多。
    毛主席不久前视察过的襄城县，有烤烟田十四万亩。从6月下旬开始到8月17日，已烤出烟叶一千七百五十万斤，虽然还不到预计产量的十分之一，但已经超过去年全县总产量91.72％。
    这种丰收景象，进一步巩固了干部和群众的增产信心。他们为了摘掉烟叶“低产”帽子，目前正通过参观评比，开展地头大辩论，纷纷修订新的跃进指标和中、后期管理措施，争取更大的丰收。
