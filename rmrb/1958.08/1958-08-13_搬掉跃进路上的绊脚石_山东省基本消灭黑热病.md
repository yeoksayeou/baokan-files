Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th (Xu Yuandao, correspondent of this agency, and Wang Jianlin, reporter) reported: Kala-azar, which has long harmed the health of the people of Shandong, has now been basically eliminated in Shandong Province.

To date, more than 250,000 kala-azar patients have been cured in the province, and the prevalence rate has dropped from more than 35 per 10,000 to 0.6 per 10,000. After recovering their health, kala-azar patients have actively engaged in agricultural production. Due to the increased labor attendance rate of farmers, intensive cultivation, and meticulous farming, grain production has increased year after year.

Kala-azar has been prevalent in Shandong for more than 80 years, covering all counties in the province. In villages with more severe epidemics, the population infection rate was as high as 20%, and almost no household was spared. According to surveys and estimates in the early days of liberation, the number of patients in the province was more than 200,000, accounting for about one-third of the total number of kala-azar patients in the country. Before liberation, the vast number of farmers lived in poverty, and the cost of treating a patient was 500 catties of grain or seven or eight taels of silk. Ordinary farmers could not afford it, and once they got sick, they had to wait for death. "A big belly swelling (kala-azar) clings to the body, and the King of Hell has a rope on the heel..." These two terrible folk rhymes are a depiction of how seriously this disease threatened people's lives at that time.

Since 1950, the Kala-azar Prevention and Treatment Institute was established in Tai'an, and Kala-azar prevention and treatment stations or health and epidemic prevention stations were established in various special districts and counties. Many prevention and treatment groups were also established in various districts and townships; 20,211 cadres and prevention and treatment personnel have been trained successively. A close prevention and treatment network and a strong prevention and treatment force have been formed in vast areas of the province. In recent years, prevention and treatment institutions at all levels have investigated 59 counties and cities, and clarified the distribution and infection of kala-azar in the province; observations and studies have also been carried out on the life habits of the sandfly, the main vector of kala-azar, and how to kill them. Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory successfully trial-produced Stibamine, which has a significant curative effect on kala-azar. The cure rate of this drug for patients within two courses of treatment is as high as 97% or more, and patients can generally recover after one course of treatment (six injections in six days).

In recent years, the province has also adopted comprehensive measures to universally prevent and treat kala-azar patients. First, general survey teams composed of public and private medical personnel in districts and townships conducted door-to-door visits to every household, and patients were treated in a timely manner and provided with free medicines. Each county epidemic prevention station has a fixed doctor or inspector to form a diagnostic group to go to various townships to conduct puncture examinations to confirm kala-azar patients, solving the difficulty in diagnosis. Patients with antimony resistance that are difficult to treat are treated by specially trained doctors in county people's hospitals. At the same time, in May every year, when sandflies begin to appear, the "666" pesticide is sprayed on the households of patients. Key inspections have found that sandflies have been eliminated in the sprayed households.

This year, the prevention and treatment of kala-azar has been carried out more rapidly, and the vast number of medical personnel and the people have actively devoted themselves to this struggle. In April, the province completed spleen palpation examinations for all children under the age of 15 and visits to adults. According to the sample appraisal conducted by four provincial appraisal teams in nineteen counties of eight special districts, the number of people examined by spleen palpation reached 90% to 98%.

### 搬掉跃进路上的绊脚石　山东省基本消灭黑热病

　　搬掉跃进路上的绊脚石
　　山东省基本消灭黑热病
    据新华社济南12日电　本社通讯员徐元道、记者王建林报道：长期危害山东人民健康的黑热病，现在在山东省内已经基本上消灭。
    到目前为止，全省共治愈黑热病人二十五万多人，流行率已由万分之三十五以上降低到万分之零点六。黑热病人健康恢复后，积极地投入农业生产。由于农民劳动出勤率提高，精耕细作，粮食年年增产。
    黑热病在山东已流行八十多年，遍及全省各县，在流行比较严重的村庄，人口感染率高达20％，几乎没有一户幸免。据解放初期调查推算，全省患病人数二十多万，约占全国黑热病人数的三分之一。解放前，广大农民生活贫困，而治疗一个病人需要花费五百斤粮食或七、八斤丝的代价，一般农民无力负担，一旦患病，只好等死。“大肚子痞（黑热病）缠了身，阎王拴着脚后跟……”。这两句可怕的民谣，就是当时这种病严重威胁着人民生命的写照。
    自从1950年开始，在泰安成立了黑热病防治所，在各专区、县建立了黑热病防治站或卫生防疫站，各区、乡也成立了不少防治小组；先后训练干部和防治人员二万零二百一十一人。全省广大地区形成了一个严密的防治网和一支强大的防治力量。几年来各级防治机构先后调查了五十九个县、市，摸清了黑热病在全省的分布和感染情况；对黑热病的主要传染媒介白蛉子的生活习性以及如何杀灭的问题也进行了观察研究。山东新华制药厂试制成功了对黑热病有显著疗效的斯锑黑克，这种药在两个疗程内，对病人的治愈率高达97％以上，一般病人治疗一个疗程（六天注射六针）即可痊愈。
    几年来，全省还采取综合措施，对黑热病人普遍进行了防治。首先由区、乡公私医务人员组成普查队，分片包干挨门逐户进行访问，发现病人就及时治疗，免费供应药品。各县防疫站都由固定的医士或检查员组成确诊组，到各乡巡回对黑热病人作穿刺检查确诊，解决了诊断上的困难。对难以治疗的抗锑病人，由各县人民医院经专门训练的医生负责治疗。同时，在每年5月白蛉子开始出现时，对病家普遍用“六六六”药剂喷洒一遍，经重点检查，在喷洒户内都消灭了白蛉子。
    今年，黑热病的防治更加快地进行，广大医务人员和人民群众都积极投入了这一斗争。4月份，全省完成了对所有十五岁以下儿童的扪脾检查和对成年人的访问。据省四个鉴定组到八个专区十九个县进行抽样鉴定，扪脾检查人数达到90％至98％。
