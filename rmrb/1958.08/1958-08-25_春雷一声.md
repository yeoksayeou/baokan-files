　　A Clap of Spring Thunder
　　Yang Shuo
    The night plane was flying east. I was half asleep, and when I opened my eyes, I saw a patch of orange-yellow light on the eastern horizon: the sun was rising. Someone pointed and said, "That light is Iraq."
    The plane skimmed over the quaint Mesopotamian plain, slowly descending towards the colorful clouds, and soon landed at Baghdad Airport.
    It was exactly five o'clock in the morning, and Baghdad was just bathed in a gentle morning glow. Elsewhere, five o'clock might not have any special meaning, but in the revolutionary history of the Iraqi people, it was a dramatic hour. Let's rewind the clock and go back a few days...
    At midnight on July 13, 1958, in a shabby palace outside Baghdad, the Iraqi Crown Prince woke up, turned on the bedside lamp, and looked at his watch; it was almost three o'clock. At five o'clock, he would accompany King Faisal, along with Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, to fly to Istanbul, Turkey, to meet with other Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact, hold a meeting, and then send troops to Lebanon to rescue Chamoun. Now it was still early, he could sleep comfortably for a while longer, someone would wake him up when the time came. He could take a cool shower, splash himself with French perfume, and then carry out the schemes of his American and British masters. Ira closed his eyes, wanting to sleep again, when suddenly someone knocked heavily on the door. At this moment, gunfire rang out outside the palace, and the revolution came crashing down like a clap of spring thunder.
    Ira jumped out of bed, hurriedly put on his clothes, and rushed out with the palace guards, grabbing a gun and leading the charge. The guards, seeing that they couldn't hold out, surrendered one after another, leaving Ira alone, still struggling fiercely for a while, before running out of the palace gates with that young, useless King Faisal, trying to escape. They had barely reached a "Hamubai" tree not far from the palace gate when the revolutionary army surrounding them opened fire, and several "royal nobles" died under the tree. By five o'clock in the morning, the revolutionary soldiers and civilians had uprooted the rotten dynasty, and the whole of Baghdad was submerged in earth-shattering cheers. It was ridiculous that the leaders of other member states of the Baghdad Pact were still waiting foolishly in Istanbul, waiting for a full two hours, but no one from Baghdad came to attend the Baghdad Pact meeting.
    After arriving in Baghdad, the first place I went to see was this palace. A handsome and capable Iraqi soldier pointed to the "Hamubai" tree and laughed, "This is a dangerous place." The tree trunk was covered with bullet marks, the tree was full of bright red berries, and a small stall had already been set up in the cool shade, selling lemonade to visitors.
    The interior of the palace was already badly damaged. The most striking thing was Ira's inner chamber. There was a safe here, and it was from this safe that those shady secret documents of the Baghdad Pact were found, some of which had already been published in Cairo newspapers, clearly exposing the vicious schemes of American imperialism to undermine Arab countries. Ira was a man of nearly fifty, needing young women to support him, and he was still messing around with King Faisal, hiding many prostitutes in the palace and filming extremely lewd movies. Iraqi friends all said that Ira was not like a man, but more like a woman, using an unknown amount of perfume every day, and even today, one can still smell a depraved odor in his inner chamber.
    I also went to see Nuri al-Said's residence. This lackey of imperialism had long persecuted the Iraqi people, advocated the formation of the Baghdad Pact, and wholeheartedly served his masters. Said's residence was close to the Tigris River, and a secret telephone was installed in his inner chamber, directly connected to the British Embassy, ready to receive orders from his masters. On the night of the revolution, Said first heard the revolutionary cries on the radio, and in a panic, picked up the secret telephone, only to find the line had been cut. He abandoned the telephone, desperately fled out the back door, and took a small boat across the river. By the time the revolutionary army rushed up, it was too late, Said had already escaped without a trace.
    The leader of the revolutionary army was the current Prime Minister, General Qasim, who at the time offered a reward of 10,000 Iraqi dinars, encouraging the people to search for Said. After noon on the fifteenth, a nineteen-year-old youth suddenly came to report, "Said is hiding in our house, carrying a gun, we can't do anything." Qasim immediately ordered a colonel and a major from his entourage of military attachés to personally arrest Said.
    The major was called Shata, and he was a member of the "Free Officers" organization. He was tall, with thick black eyebrows that connected, and a black brush-like mustache on his upper lip. On the night we arrived in Baghdad, Prime Minister Qasim specifically introduced Shata to us at a banquet, saying, "This is the major who personally dealt with Said." A few days later, late one night, Major Shata personally came to see us at the Baghdad Hotel, and I asked him to talk about the story of capturing Said.
    The major lit a cigarette, looking straight at me, pondered for a moment, and said concisely, "After receiving the task, we took ten soldiers in two jeeps and followed the young man to his house. The young man was an ordinary student, his home was in eastern Baghdad, not far from the American Embassy. We searched his house, but it was empty, it turned out Said had hid elsewhere ten minutes earlier. We turned to search elsewhere, still couldn't find him, and were walking back when we saw many people crowded on the street, vying to tell us: 'Said ran away disguised as a woman.' I looked ahead, and sure enough, there was a woman wearing a black veil over her head and body, running away. Was it Said? Who else could it be. This old wolf was holding a pistol in one hand, like a cowboy in an American movie, and started shooting wildly when he saw us chasing him. We returned fire, and a few shots brought Said down, ending the criminal life of this traitor."
    I couldn't help but ask, "Where do you think he was trying to run?"
    Major Shata had a mocking smile on the corner of his mouth, "The Iraqi people had already laid a dragnet, where could he run? That night he escaped from his house, first hiding in the house of a woman with whom he had a dirty relationship, but couldn't stay there, so he disguised himself as a woman and came to this area. There is the American Embassy in this area, but unfortunately it is surrounded by military police, and it is not easy to get in. This old dog was hiding and dodging, bumping around everywhere. In the end, the direction he ran was exactly towards the American Embassy, he died only three hundred yards away from the American Embassy, where do you think he was trying to run?"
    I asked again, "Do you know the name of the young man who reported the news?"
    The major said, "Unfortunately, I forgot to ask, anyway, he was an Iraqi. Didn't I just tell you that the government had offered a reward of 10,000 dinars for the capture of Said, this money should naturally be awarded to that young man – what do you think he did?"
    I said, "He must be happy."
    The major said with a sigh, "No, he refused. He said it was his duty."
    I couldn't help but exclaim, "What good people!"
    Major Shata meaningfully concluded, "The towering crimes that Nuri al-Said committed against the people, even if you plucked out all the hairs on his body, you couldn't count all his crimes; even if he were torn to pieces, it wouldn't be enough to compensate. This traitor once said before his death: 'The person who will kill me hasn't been born yet.' What was the result?"
    As a result, the people finally gave him the punishment he deserved. (Attached pictures)

　　春雷一声
　　杨朔
    夜航机正往东飞。我睡得蒙蒙胧胧的，睁眼一看，东方天边烘出一片橙黄色的霞光：太阳正往上升。有人指着说：“霞光那里就是伊拉克了。”
    飞机掠过古色古香的美索不达米亚平原，冲着彩霞慢慢落，转眼落到巴格达机场上。
    正是清晨五点钟，巴格达刚好闪着一片柔和的朝阳。要在别处，五点不一定有什么特殊意思，但在伊拉克人民的革命史上，这却是个富有戏剧性的钟点。不妨让我们倒拨时针，暂且退回去几天。……
    1958年7月13日半夜，在巴格达市外一座蹩脚的皇宫里，伊拉王储醒过来，扭亮床头的台灯看看表，将近三点。到五点，他将要陪着国王费萨尔，带上内阁首相努里·赛义德，一起转道飞往土耳其的伊斯坦布尔，跟别的巴格达条约穆斯林成员国会合，开个会，然后就要派兵到黎巴嫩去，援救夏蒙。现在离五点还早呢，他尽可以舒舒服服多睡一会，到时候总有人来叫醒他。他可以清清凉凉洗个冷水澡，浑身上下洒满法国香水，然后再去执行美英主子的计谋。伊拉闭上眼，才想再睡，忽然有人重重地敲门。这时候，皇宫外头响了枪，革命像一声春雷似的劈头盖顶压上来了。
    伊拉跳下床，胡乱穿上衣服，冲到皇宫的卫队一起，抓起一挺枪领着头抵挡。卫队看看抵挡不住，纷纷投降，丢下伊拉一个人，还穷凶极恶地挣扎了一阵，才跟那个年轻无用的费萨尔国王一道冲出宫门，企图逃走。刚跑到宫门前不远一棵“哈木柏”树下，围在四周的革命军队一齐射击，几个“皇室贵人”便都死在树下了。到早晨五点钟，革命的军民已经连根掀翻腐烂的王朝，整个巴格达淹没在震动天地的欢呼声里。可笑巴格达条约其他成员国的首脑还在伊斯坦布尔痴等，足足等了两小时，巴格达方面再也没有人来参加巴格达条约会议了。
    我到巴格达后，最先去看的便是这座皇宫。一个漂亮精悍的伊拉克士兵指着那棵“哈木柏”树笑道：“这可是个危险地方啊。”树干上满是弹痕，满树结着鲜艳的小红豆，树凉影里已经摆上一个小摊，专卖柠檬水给来往参观的人喝。
    皇宫内部早已破坏不堪。顶惹人注意的是伊拉的内室。这里有个保险柜，就是从这个柜里搜出那些见不得人的巴格达条约密件，当中有几份已经在开罗报纸上发表，清清楚楚暴露出美帝国主义破坏阿拉伯国家的毒辣阴谋。伊拉是个将近五十岁的人，行动都得年轻的女人扶着，还跟国王费萨尔搅在一起，把许多妓女藏到宫里，拍了些下流到极点的影片。伊拉克朋友都说伊拉不像男人，更像女人，每天不知要往身上洒多少香水，到今天还可以在他的内室里闻到一股荒淫的邪味。
    我也去看了看努里·赛义德的住处。这个帝国主义豢养的奴才长期迫害着伊拉克人民，倡议结成巴格达条约，死心塌地的替他的主子效劳。赛义德的住处紧临底格里斯河，内室装了个秘密电话，直通英国大使馆，随时可以接受主子的命令。革命爆发那一晚间，赛义德首先从无线电里听到革命的呼声，急的拿起秘密电话，谁知线割断了，便丢下电话，丧魂失魄地逃出后门，坐上条小船逃过河去。革命军队扑上来时，晚了，赛义德早逃得无影无踪。
    革命军队的领导人就是现任总理卡塞姆将军，当时悬赏一万伊拉克第纳尔，鼓励人民搜捕赛义德。十五号过午，忽然有个十九岁的青年跑来报信说：“赛义德就躲在我们家里，还带着枪，我们不能动手。”卡塞姆立刻命令随从武官里的一个上校和一个少校亲自去捉赛义德。
    那个少校叫沙塔，是“自由军官”组织里的人，长的身量高大，两条眉毛又重又黑，连到一起，上唇留着一把刷子也似的黑胡子。我们来到巴格达的当天晚上，卡塞姆总理曾经在宴会上特意向我们介绍沙塔说：“就是这个少校亲手处置赛义德的。”过不几天的一个深夜，沙塔少校亲自到巴格达旅馆来看我们，我就请他谈谈捉赛义德的故事。
    少校点起支烟抽着，眼睛直望着我，沉思一会，口气简洁地说：“我们接到任务后，带着十个士兵，坐上两部吉普车，跟着那个青年去到他家里。青年是个普普通通的学生，家在巴格达东部，离美国大使馆不远。到他家一搜，扑了个空，原来赛义德早在十分钟前躲到别处去了。我们又转往别处搜，还是搜不着，又往回走，就见许多人挤在街上，争着告诉我们说：‘赛义德装扮成女人跑了。’我往前一看，果然有个女人头上身上披着黑纱，正在飞跑。这是赛义德么？不是他是谁。这只老狼一手拿着一支手枪，像美国电影上的牧童，看看我们追上来，乱打起枪来。我们就还击，几枪就把赛义德打倒，结束了这个奸贼的罪恶的生命。”
    我忍不住问道：“你看他想往哪里跑？”
    沙塔少校嘴角上挂着个嘲弄的微笑说：“伊拉克人民早撒下天罗地网，他又能往哪里跑呢？那晚上他从家里逃出来，先藏到一个跟他有肮脏关系的女人家里，藏不住，就化装成女人，来到这一带。这一带有美国大使馆，可惜周围布满军警，不容易进去。这老狗就藏藏掩掩的，四处瞎撞。到最后，他跑的方向恰恰是冲着美国大使馆，他死的地方离美国大使馆只有三百码远，你说他究竟要往哪里跑呢？”
    我又问道：“你知不知道那个报信的青年的姓名？”
    少校说：“可惜我忘记问，反正是个伊拉克人就是了。我刚才不是告诉你么，政府曾经悬赏一万第纳尔，捉拿赛义德，这笔钱自然应该奖给那个青年——你猜他呢？”
    我说：“他当然高兴。”
    少校带着叹息的声调说：“不，他拒绝了。他说这是他应尽的义务。”
    我不禁大声赞叹道：“多好的人民啊！”
    沙塔少校意味深长地结束他的话说：“努里·赛义德对人民所犯的滔天大罪，拔完他全身的汗毛，也数不清他的罪恶；碎尸万段，也抵偿不过来。这个卖国贼生前曾经说：‘杀我的人还没生下来呢。’结果呢？”
    结果，人民却终于给了他应得的惩罚。（附图片）
