Editorial Note:

    Valuing the Creativity of the Masses
    The method of using bamboo skewers to help corn grow, employed by the Science Research Station of the Shanba Agricultural Cooperative in Dafang County, Guizhou, is simple, easy to implement, and highly effective, making it worthy of widespread promotion.

    Perhaps some people think that this method lacks a scientific basis and doubt its reliability. However, they have already used this method to cause more than two thousand corn plants that did not produce ears to do so, which is an undeniable fact. We should believe that the wisdom of the masses is infinite and their experience is rich. As long as we can further harness the wisdom of the masses and discover and improve existing experiences, we can make great contributions to the cause of socialist construction, and scientific theories can be generated on the basis of facts.

    重视群众的创造
    贵州大方县山坝农业社科学研究站用插竹签帮助玉米生育的办法，简单易行，效果很大，值得大大推广。
    也许有人以为这个办法没有科学根据，对它的可靠性发生怀疑。然而，他们用这个方法已使二千多株不结包的玉米结了包，这是无可怀疑的事实。我们应当相信：群众的智慧是无穷的，群众的经验是丰富的。只要能够进一步发挥群众的智慧，发掘和提高已有的经验，就能对社会主义建设事业作出很大的贡献，也就能够在事实的基础上产生科学理论。
