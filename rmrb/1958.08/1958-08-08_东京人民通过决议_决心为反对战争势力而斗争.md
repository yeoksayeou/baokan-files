　　Determined to Fight Against War Forces
　　About 10,000 workers, students, and citizens of Tokyo held a "Citizens' Rally for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Tests and the Prevention of Nuclear Armament." Participants held signs reading "The U.S. and Britain must immediately halt nuclear tests," "Prevent Japan's nuclear armament," and opposing the organization of a Northeast Asia military alliance.
　　Miyamoto Kenji, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, as well as Ferninand Vigne, responsible secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, who attended the Fourth World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, and representatives from Peru, France, West Germany, and other countries attended this grand gathering.
　　Miyamoto Kenji, Asanuma Inejirō, and the Peruvian representative delivered speeches at the meeting, unanimously calling for the prohibition of nuclear tests and the prevention of nuclear armament.
　　The meeting passed a resolution amidst warm applause, demanding that the U.S. and British governments follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately halt nuclear tests, and immediately withdraw their invading forces from the Middle East.
　　The resolution also demanded that the U.S. government stop transporting nuclear weapons into Japan. The resolution emphasized that the United States must not interfere in the affairs of Japan and Asia.
　　The meeting also passed a resolution presenting the following demands to the Kishi Nobusuke government: urge the U.S. and British governments to follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately halt nuclear weapons tests; do not arm the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons, and do not transport nuclear weapons into Japan; demand that the Japanese government and the Diet issue a declaration prohibiting nuclear armament, and discuss with governments of various countries the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones; thoroughly oppose the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East, and prevent U.S. and British armed intervention in Asia and Africa; formulate a relief law for Japanese atomic bomb victims.
　　The meeting concluded with a declaration. The declaration condemned the U.S. and Britain for continuing to pursue a policy of war, conducting nuclear weapons tests, expanding atomic bomb bases, and recently intervening militarily in the Middle East, deepening the crisis of war, even after the Soviet Union had stopped nuclear tests. The declaration stated that the eight million citizens of Tokyo are always determined to oppose atomic and hydrogen bombs and will thoroughly struggle against all war forces and to prevent nuclear armament.
　　After the meeting, all participants held a demonstration parade and sang anti-atomic bomb songs.

    东京人民通过决议
    决心为反对战争势力而斗争
    东京的工人、学生和市民约一万人，举行了“禁止试验原子弹氢弹和阻止核武装”的市民奋起大会。参加大会的人手里拿着“美英两国立即停止核试验”、“阻止日本核武装”和反对组织东北亚军事同盟等标语。
    日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治、社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎以及出席第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的世界和平理事会书记处负责书记费南·维涅夫妇和秘鲁、法国、西德等国家的代表都出席了这次盛大的集会。
    宫本显治和浅沼稻次郎以及秘鲁代表分别在会上致词，他们一致呼吁禁止核试验和阻止核武装。
    大会在热烈掌声中通过决议，要求美英政府效法苏联立即停止核试验，并且立即从中东撤出侵略军。
    决议还要求美国政府停止把核武器运进日本。决议强调不许美国干涉日本和亚洲的事务。
    大会还通过一项决议，向岸信介政府提出了下列要求：促使美英两国效法苏联立即停止试验核武器；不要用核武器武装日本“自卫队”、不要把核兵器运进日本；要求日本政府和国会发表禁止核武装的宣言，并且和各国政府商讨设立无核武器区域；彻底反对美英两国侵略中东，阻止美英对亚非的武装干涉；制定日本原子弹受害者的救济法。
    大会最后发表了宣言。宣言谴责美英两国在苏联停止核试验以后，依然推行战争政策，进行核武器试验，扩建原子弹基地，最近又武装干涉中东，加深战争的危机。宣言表示，八百万东京市民始终抱定反对原子弹氢弹的决心，为反对一切战争势力和阻止核武装而彻底地进行斗争。
    全体与会者在会后举行了示威游行，并且高唱反对原子弹的歌曲。
