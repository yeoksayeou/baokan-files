US, British News Agencies and Newspapers Admit
Arab National Independence Movement is Irresistible
America's anti-communist frenzy and military policy have blinded it, attempting to push Arab countries into military treaties, resulting in utter chaos.
——Associated Press commentator

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. AP commentator, Ryan, said on the 4th, "American policy towards the Arab East seems to be a complete mess."

Ryan pointed out that the United States is full of anti-communist fanaticism and has been "blinded by its obsession with military policies for many years, thus attempting to push Arab countries into military treaties." Ryan said, "This attempt failed. So the United States helped organize an agreement called the Baghdad Pact, named after a city where probably 90% of the literate residents oppose it, which can be said to be an irony. This treaty is considered a bulwark against communism, but Arab nationalists see it as an excuse to maintain Western military power in the Arab world for a long time."

Ryan admitted that "American diplomacy is terrified by Arab nationalism"; admitted that there is no so-called "threat of communist military offensive" in the Middle East; and admitted that "the United States and Britain have always stood on the side of unpopular figures, causes, and regimes." He said that the United States supported Iraq's Nuri al-Said, a "tool of British policy," but was "unwilling to face the fact that Nuri's autocratic rule was opposed by an overwhelming majority of the literate residents of Iraq." Jordan's Hussein can only survive with the support of Britain and the United States. The United States has invested a lot of capital in Hussein—about 130 million US dollars. To protect this precarious investment, the United States must spend more and more money. Due to the implementation of this policy, therefore, "by the time the Iraqi incident broke out, it seemed that the United States and Britain had nothing to do but intervene militarily in Lebanon and Jordan."

Ryan lamented that this armed intervention policy was "the result of a series of miscalculations by the United States." He believes that "in the long run, it is doubtful whether intervention can serve American policy."

Ryan had to admit: "Military force cannot stop Arab nationalism." Therefore, he anxiously urged the US authorities to quickly "honestly study the weaknesses of their own American policy," and hinted that the United States should step up planning political and economic conspiracies.

　　Britain is now trapped in the desert, waiting for events to happen and expecting blows that cannot be effectively dealt with.
　　　　　　　　——American "News Chronicle"

Xinhua News Agency, London, June 6th. Some British bourgeois newspapers have voiced a chorus of mourning over the plight of colonialism, which has been weakened in the era of rising national liberation movements, believing that Britain's gunboat policy towards the Middle East is useless and counterproductive.

The "News Chronicle" commented in detail on Britain's awkward situation in Jordan in today's editorial. The editorial said: "Britain is now trapped in the desert, waiting for events to happen and expecting blows that cannot be effectively dealt with."

The newspaper pointed out that Arab nationalism in the Middle East is the winning side. The newspaper helplessly said that compromising with the winner is not heroic. But it admitted: "It is difficult to see any other way."

The editorial said, "King Hussein is clearly in danger. If he is overthrown, what will Britain do? Recognize the republic and withdraw from Jordan, or start to extinguish Arab nationalism?"

"We must realize that although we are in Jordan, we are hated and will eventually be resisted. If we leave, the current regime will collapse within a few months."

Speaking of the American position in Lebanon, the newspaper said: "The longer the Americans stay, the more hatred they arouse."

The newspaper finally said that British policies based on fantasy will only bring disaster.

The most conservative "Daily Telegraph" also expressed concern: If British troops withdraw, what will happen? The newspaper's editorial said that Britain's position in Jordan is "not enviable." The editorial said: "In practice and in politics, we are in a dangerous position in Jordan. One of our goals at the highest-level conference and in the United Nations must be to retreat without losing face or suffering disaster."

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. London News: The widely circulated "Daily Mirror" said in an editorial on the 6th that the West must frankly admit the fact that "armed intervention is outdated." It said that armed intervention "cannot stop Arab nationalism, nor can it guarantee the supply of oil, but it can endanger peace."

From the standpoint of safeguarding the interests of the British ruling group, this newspaper believes that Britain must "compromise with Arab nationalism."

The newspaper said: "Supporting feudal sheikhs and unpopular kings with American and British bayonets cannot be considered a policy. It is an act of desperation."

It advocated that Britain and the United States must buy the oil they need from Middle Eastern countries with cash, like ordinary buyers. "They must sign commercial agreements with Arab countries and abandon the idea of demanding special privileges," because "after all, it is someone else's oil."

### 美英通讯社和报纸承认  阿拉伯民族独立运动势不可挡

    美英通讯社和报纸承认
    阿拉伯民族独立运动势不可挡
    美国反共狂热和军事方针迷住了心窍，企图把阿拉伯国家推入军事条约，结果陷入一团混乱。    ——美联社评论员
    新华社7日讯  美联社评论员瑞安4日说：“美国对阿拉伯东方的政策看来似乎是一团混乱。”
    瑞安指出，美国有满脑袋的反共狂热，而且多年以来被一味搞军事的方针“迷住了心窍，因而企图把阿拉伯国家推入军事条约”。瑞安说：“这种尝试失败了。于是美国就帮忙组织一个名叫巴格达条约的协定，这个协定用其中大概90％识字的居民都表示反对的一个城市的名字来命名，这可以说是一个讽刺。这个条约据认为是对付共产主义的一个堡垒，但是阿拉伯民族主义者却认为它是在阿拉伯世界长期保持西方的军事力量的一个借口。”
    瑞安承认“美国的外交被阿拉伯民族主义搞得心惊胆颤”；承认中东并没有所谓“共产党军事进攻的威胁”，并且承认“美国和英国总是站在不得民心的人物、事业和政权的一边”。他说，美国支持伊拉克的努里·赛义德这个“英国政策的工具”，却“不愿意正视努里的独裁统治遭到伊拉克识字的居民中压倒大多数的反对这样一个事实”。约旦的侯赛因也只有依靠英美两国的支持才能活下去。美国在侯赛因身上投下了大笔资本——大约一亿三千万美元。为了保护这一笔岌岌可危的投资，美国必须花费越来越多的钱。由于执行这个政策，因此，“到伊拉克事件爆发的时候，看来，美英除了以武力干涉黎巴嫩和约旦以外没有什么可做的了。”
    瑞安悲叹这种武装干涉政策是“美国一连串的失算的结果”。他认为，“从长期看，干涉能否为美国政策服务是值得怀疑的”。
    瑞安不得不承认：“武力制止不了阿拉伯民族主义”。因此，他焦急地竭力催促美国当局赶快“对美国政策自己的弱点老实地研究一下”，并且暗示美国应该加紧策划政治、经济阴谋。
    英国现在陷在沙漠中，等待着事件的发生和期待着不能有效地加以对付的打击。
                  ——美国“新闻纪事报”
    据新华社伦敦6日电  英国的一些资产阶级报纸对在民族解放运动高涨时代，殖民主义者已一蹶不振的困境发出一片哀鸣声，认为英国对中东的炮舰政策是无用的并且是会产生反效果的。
    “新闻纪事报”在今天的社论中详细评论了英国在约旦的尴尬处境。社论说：“英国现在陷在沙漠中，等待着事件的发生和期待着不能有效地加以对付的打击。”
    报纸指出，中东的阿拉伯民族主义是得胜的一方。报纸无可奈何地说，同得胜者妥协是不英勇的。但是它承认：“很难看到有其他办法。”
    社论说，“侯赛因国王显然处在危险中。假如他被推翻了，英国怎么办呢？是承认共和国和撤出约旦呢，还是开始扑灭阿拉伯民族主义？”
    “我们必须认识到，虽然我们是在约旦，但是我们是遭人痛恨的并且最后会遭到抵抗。如果我们走了，现政权就会在几月之内垮台。”
    报纸在谈到美国在黎巴嫩的地位时说：“美国人呆得愈久，他们所引起的憎恨愈大。”
    报纸最后说，以幻想为基础的英国政策只会带来灾难。
    最保守的“每日电讯报”也表示担心：假如英军撤退，不知会发生什么情况。报纸的社论说英国在约旦的地位是“不值得羡慕的”。社论说：“在实际上和在政治上，我们在约旦都处在危险的地位。我们在最高级会议和在联合国中的目的之一必须是既不丢脸也不遭受灾难地打退堂鼓。”
    新华社7日讯  伦敦消息：销路很广的“每日镜报”在6日的社论里说，西方必须痛快地承认“武装干涉已经过时”这个事实。它说，武装干涉“不能制止阿拉伯民族主义，也不能保证石油的供应，但是却能危及和平”。
    这家报纸从维护英国统治集团的利益的立场出发，认为，英国必须“同阿拉伯民族主义妥协。”
    报纸说：“用美英刺刀来支持封建酋长和不得人心的国王不能算是政策。这是一种绝望的行动。”
    它主张，英美必须像普通买主一样用现款来向中东国家购买他们所需要的石油。“它们必须同阿拉伯国家签订商业协定，并且抛弃要求享受特权的念头”，因为“这毕竟是别人的石油”。
