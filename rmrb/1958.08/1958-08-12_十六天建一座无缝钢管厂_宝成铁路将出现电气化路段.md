　　Sixteen Days to Build a Seamless Steel Tube Factory
　　Baoji-Chengdu Railway to Have Electrified Sections
    The experimental construction of China's first electrified railway, the Baoji (Baoji) to Fengzhou (Feng County) section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, has begun. The workers undertaking the experimental construction are currently erecting poles along the line for the contact network of the electric locomotives. Starting from Qinling Station and going south along the Jialing River, more than ten kilometers have already been completed.

    The Baoji (Baoji) to Feng (County) section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway winds south through the Qinling Mountains. The mountains are high and the slopes are steep. Steam locomotives are slow and carry little. Electrification of this section of the line was planned when the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was designed. The electrification project for this section of the line includes eight items: transmission lines, contact network, traction substations, electrical communication signal engineering, and electric locomotive depots. Because China has no previous experience in the construction of electric railways, it was decided that before the formal construction of the main project, an experimental construction phase was necessary.

    The first batch of construction forces from the Electrified Railway First Engineering Section, which is undertaking this project, has now all entered the Qinling construction site. The workers participating in this new technical team have expressed their determination to strive to complete the electrification and opening of this railway ahead of schedule.

    The first seamless steel tube in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was born in Wuzhou City on the afternoon of the 7th. This seamless steel tube, made of round steel with a diameter of 76 mm and a length of 1.35 meters, was rolled by a seamless steel tube factory jointly built by three small factories: the Wuzhou Sugar Factory, the Machinery Factory, and the Shipyard.

    The seamless steel tube factory took only sixteen days from construction to completion. According to its design capacity, it can produce 10,000 tons of steel tubes per year.

    The commissioning of this seamless steel tube factory will enable Guangxi's steel industry, which only began large-scale production of steel ingots this year, to gradually achieve simultaneous steelmaking and steel rolling, and gradually achieve local material sourcing, local rolling, and local supply of steel in the autonomous region, in order to promote faster development of other industries.

    Six steel plants in Jiangxi Province have recently started construction one after another.

    They are distributed in Xinyu, Yongxin, Nanchang, Pingxiang, Ji'an, Dongxiang and other places.

    All six steel plants are adopting the method of building and producing at the same time, starting small and gradually expanding, and will be partially put into production this year.

    Another modern silk factory – the Sichuan Provincial State-owned Suining Silk Factory – recently broke ground and is planned to be completed and put into production in the second quarter of next year.

    This factory is the same as the cotton spinning factory, and it is expected to shorten the construction time by two-thirds compared with Mianyang, reduce the capital used by about 60% compared with Mianyang, and use several hundred tons less steel, while also ensuring that the standard quality is delivered to the country.

　　十六天建一座无缝钢管厂
　　宝成铁路将出现电气化路段
    我国第一条电气化铁路——宝成路宝（鸡）凤（州）段工程，已经开始试验性施工。担负试验性施工任务的职工，目前正在沿线栽立架设电气机车接触线网用的电杆。从秦岭车站起沿嘉陵江向南，现在已经栽完了十多公里。
    宝成路宝（鸡）凤（县）段盘秦岭而南下，山高坡大，用蒸汽机车引牵列车，走得慢拉得少，还在设计宝成路时就预定这段线路要采用电气化。这段线路的电气化工程，包括输送电线路、接触线网、牵引变电所、电气通讯信号工程、电力机务段等八项。因为我国过去没有电气铁路的施工经验，所以决定在主要工程正式施工前，先要经过试验性的施工阶段。
    承担这项工程的电气化铁道第一工程段的第一批施工力量，现在已经全部进入秦岭工地。参加这支新生技术队伍的职工，表示决心争取提前完成这条铁路的电气化通车任务。

    广西僮族自治区第一根无缝钢管，七日下午在梧州市诞生。这根用圆钢轧成的口径七十六公厘、一点三五公尺长的无缝钢管，是由梧州市糖厂、机械厂、造船厂三个小厂合作建成的无缝钢管厂轧制出来的。
    这座无缝钢管厂从施工到建成只有十六天，按设计能力可年产钢管一万吨。
    这个无缝钢管厂投入生产，将使在今年才开始大量生产钢锭的广西钢铁工业，逐步做到炼钢与轧钢齐头并进，在钢材生产上逐步做到自治区内就地取材，就地轧制、就地供应、以促进其他工业更快的发展。

    江西省六个钢铁厂最近先后动工兴建。
    它们分布在新余、永新、南昌、萍乡、吉安、东乡等地。
    这六个钢铁厂都采取边建设边生产的办法，先小后大、逐步建成，今年即可部分投入生产。

    又一座现代化丝厂——四川省国营遂宁丝厂，在最近破土兴建，计划在明年第二季建成生产。
    这个厂与棉纺丝厂相同，预计可比绵阳缩短三分之二的建厂时间，可比绵阳少用资金约60％，少用几百吨钢材，还保证达到标准质量交给国家。　（遂丝）
