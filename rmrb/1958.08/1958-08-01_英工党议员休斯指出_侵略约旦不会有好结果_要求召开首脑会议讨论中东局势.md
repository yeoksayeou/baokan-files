Moscow dispatch by our newspaper on the 31st - Today's Soviet "Literary Gazette" published an article by British Labour MP Emrys Hughes entitled "The Most Important Thing is to Hold a Summit Conference," supporting the Soviet government's proposal to hold a summit conference to discuss the Near and Middle East issue, and opposing the British government's sending troops to Jordan.

The MP condemned the British government's armed aggression against Near and Middle Eastern countries by sending troops to Jordan, saying: "The British government has not accepted the true lesson brought to Britain by the Suez Canal incident. This incident not only failed militarily for Britain, but also brought more serious consequences to the British economy." The MP believes: "At present, Britain's military invasion of Jordan will not yield any good results. It can only create new enemies for Britain in the Near and Middle Eastern countries and consume expenses that the British economy can hardly bear." He pointed out: "In the current situation, the British government must be prepared to participate in the summit conference proposed by the Soviet Union, must withdraw British invading forces from the Near and Middle East, and extinguish the flames of a new war that may be ignited."

The MP concluded in the article: "In Britain, the broad public enthusiastically supports the prompt convening of a summit conference to discuss the Near and Middle East issue. British Labour Party members not only hope to withdraw British invading troops from Jordan and stop sending weapons to the Near and Middle Eastern countries, but also hope to prevent the Near and Middle East region from becoming a region of threatening conflict."

    英工党议员休斯指出
    侵略约旦不会有好结果
    要求召开首脑会议讨论中东局势
    本报莫斯科31日电　今天的苏联“文学报”刊载了英国工党议员埃姆里斯·休斯的一篇题为“最重要的是召开首脑会议”的文章，支持苏联政府提出的召开首脑会议讨论中近东问题的建议，并反对英国政府出兵约旦。
    这位议员在文章中谴责英国政府武装侵略中近东国家出兵约旦，他说：“英国政府没有接受苏伊士运河事件带给英国真正的教训。这次事件，英国不仅在军事上失败了，而且给英国经济带来了更严重的后果。”这位议员认为：“目前英国出兵侵略约旦，是不会得到任何好结果的。它只能使英国在中近东国家招来新的敌人和消耗英国经济能力难于担负的费用。”他指出：“在目前形势下，英国政府必须准备参加苏联提议召开的首脑会议，必须从中近东撤出英国侵略军队，扑灭可能燃起的新战争火焰。”
    这位议员在文章中最后说：“在英国，广大的公众都热烈支持迅速召开首脑会议来讨论中近东问题。英国工党党员们不仅希望从约旦撤出英国侵略军和停止向中近东国家输送武器，并且希望使中近东地区不再成为威胁性冲突的地区。”
