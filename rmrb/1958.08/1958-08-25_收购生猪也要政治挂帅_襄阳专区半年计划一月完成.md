　　Acquiring Live Pigs Must Also Put Politics in Command
    Xiangyang Prefecture Completes Half-Year Plan in One Month

    (Our dispatch) The reason the live pig acquisition plan wasn't completed well is because the fat pigs were all bought up, or because the masses are busy with central production tasks? The commercial departments of Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, have proven that neither is correct. This prefecture acquired a total of 91,155 live pigs in July, accounting for 111% of the total acquisition in the first half of the year; the main reason is putting politics in command, with everything proceeding from the benefit of production and the convenience of the masses.

    The Finance and Trade Department of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xiangyang Prefectural Administrative Office Commercial Bureau, based on the situation that the live pig acquisition plan was not completed well enough in the first half of the year, through great airing of views, great contending, and great debate at the Finance and Trade Department Heads Meeting of the Prefectural Committee and the Commercial Bureau Heads Meeting of the Xiangyang Prefectural Administrative Office, criticized various pessimistic arguments; thus a new situation appeared in the live pig acquisition work. The live pig acquisition work in Yicheng County took the lead in breaking the record in the entire district, and then other counties strove to catch up. The commercial departments of Sui County proposed at the Great Leap Forward Conference: work hard for half a month to acquire 20,000 live pigs. As a result, this county acquired 18,350 live pigs in just seven days.

    From the great debate and the actual acquisition situation completed afterward, it is proven that doubting whether live pig production has developed and one-sidedly shouting that the central production task is busy and that acquisition work cannot be inserted are just excuses. One of the reasons why the live pig acquisition work in Xiangyang Prefecture was not done well in the past is that some commercial cadres opposed departmental work to the central work, and therefore could not actively meet the purchasing and sales demands of the masses.

    On the basis of liberating thought and putting politics in command, the commercial departments of Xiangyang Prefecture, also according to the situation of the leaping development of industrial and agricultural production, broke old conventions, changed the past practice of passively waiting for the masses to come to sell live pigs and doing things according to old rules, and changed to relying on the masses, proceeding from the benefit of production and convenience of the masses, and adopting the acquisition method of "five on-the-spots and three carry-alongs," that is, acquiring "on the spot, at the cooperative, at the team, at the village, and at the pigpen"; and when acquiring, "bring meat coupons, bring scales, bring money." Therefore, it greatly facilitated the masses and enabled the live pig acquisition plan to be overfulfilled more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　收购生猪也要政治挂帅
    襄阳专区半年计划一月完成
    本报讯　生猪收购计划完成得不好，是因为肥猪收完了呢，还是群众生产中心任务忙？湖北省襄阳专区商业部门证明都不对。这个专区7月份共收购生猪九万一千一百五十五头，为上半年收购总数的111％；主要原因是政治挂帅，一切从有利生产和便利群众出发。
    中共襄阳地委财贸部和襄阳专署商业局，根据上半年生猪收购计划完成得不够好的情况，在地委财贸部长会议和襄阳专署商业局长会议上，通过大鸣大放大辩论，批判了各种悲观论调；使生猪收购工作出现了新的局面。宜城县的生猪收购工作首先在全区打开纪录，接着其他各县奋起直追。随县商业部门在跃进大会上提出：苦战半个月，收购生猪二万头。结果这个县在短短七天中间，就收购了生猪一万八千三百五十头。
    从大辩论以及以后实际完成的收购情况证明，怀疑生猪生产是否发展了和片面叫喊生产中心任务忙，收购工作插不进去，都只是一种借口。襄阳专区过去生猪收购工作搞得不够好，原因之一就是部分商业干部把部门工作和中心工作对立起来，因此不能积极地去满足群众的购销要求。
    在解放思想、政治挂帅的基础上，襄阳专区商业部门还根据工农业生产飞跃发展的形势，打破陈规，改变了过去坐等群众上门出售生猪，按老规矩办事的做法，改为依靠群众，一切从有利生产和方便群众出发，采取“五就三带”的收购方法，“就点、就社、就队、就湾、就圈”收购；收购时“带肉票、带秤、带款”。因此大大便利了群众，也使生猪收购计划能够多、快、好、省地超额完成。
