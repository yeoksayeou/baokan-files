    Our Air Force Damages a Chiang Kai-shek Plane
    The US and Chiang Intensify War Preparations in Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 7th – The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force shot and damaged one US-made Chiang Kai-shek plane today.

    At approximately 7 AM, a group of US-made Chiang Kai-shek military aircraft took off from Taiwan and intruded into our coastal areas in Fujian Province. Our Air Force immediately scrambled to intercept them, and shot and damaged one of them over the Jinjiang area.

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th – US imperialism continues to intensify war preparations in the Taiwan area, creating a tense situation.

    According to Reuters, a batch of American "F-100 Super Sabre" jets were flown from Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Taiwan on the 3rd to strengthen the so-called "defense" capabilities of the Taiwan area. US Thirteenth Air Force Commander Thomas Moorman also rushed from the Philippines to Taipei on the 6th, preparing to hold "talks on operational issues" with US Taiwan Task Force Thirteenth Commander Fred Dean and senior Chiang Kai-shek military personnel, plotting war conspiracies. Moorman also blatantly clamored that the American aircraft currently deployed in Taiwan "can be used to fight against the Chinese Communist aircraft" "if ordered." According to Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency, the newly appointed Commander of the "US Taiwan Defense Command" Smoot, and Deputy Commander and Chief of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group Doan, had inspected the Chiang military's war preparations in Kinmen a week ago.

    Under the instigation of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has recently been constantly harassing and carrying out military provocations against our mainland. From July 25th, the Chiang Kai-shek gang conducted a six-day large-scale military exercise in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and forcibly requisitioned civilian ships and vehicles, forcing a large number of Taiwanese youths to build fortifications and carry out "military training" for the Chiang military.

    我空军击伤蒋机一架
    美蒋在台湾加紧备战活动
    新华社福建前线7日电  中国人民解放军空军今天击伤美制蒋机一架。
    上午七时许，美制蒋军飞机一批，从台湾起飞窜扰我福建沿海地区。我空军当即起飞迎击，在晋江地区上空击伤其中一架。
    据新华社7日讯  美帝国主义继续在台湾地区加紧备战活动，制造紧张局势。
    据路透社透露，美国一批“F—100超佩刀式”喷气机已在3日从菲律宾的克拉克基地飞到台湾，加强台湾地区的所谓“防御”力量。美国第十三航空队司令托马·穆尔曼也在6日从菲律宾赶到台北，准备同美国驻台湾第十三特遣航空队司令弗雷德·迪恩和蒋帮高级军事人员“就作战问题进行会谈”，策划战争阴谋。穆尔曼还公然叫嚣，现在部署在台湾的美国飞机，“如果得到命令”，“可以用来跟中国共产党的飞机战斗”。据蒋帮中央社透露，新任“美国台湾防御司令部”司令斯摩特、副司令兼美国军事援助顾问团团长多安等，在一个星期前曾到金门检查蒋军战争准备工作。
    在美国的指使下，蒋介石集团最近不断向我大陆进行骚扰和军事挑衅活动。从7月25日起，蒋帮在台湾和澎湖列岛进行了为时六天的大规模的军事演习，并且强征民船和车辆，强迫大批台湾青年为蒋军修建工事和进行“军事训练”。
