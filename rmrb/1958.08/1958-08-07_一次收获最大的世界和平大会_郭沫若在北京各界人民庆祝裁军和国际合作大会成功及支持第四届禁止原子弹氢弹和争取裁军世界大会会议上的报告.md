Comrades, Friends:

The "Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference" held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on July 16, successfully closed on July 22. This conference, in terms of opposing American aggression and supporting the anti-colonialist movement, was the most successful and fruitful meeting since the launch of the peace movement. Today, we, the people of all circles in Beijing, are solemnly gathering here to warmly celebrate the achievements of this conference and to express the Chinese people's support for the resolutions of the conference. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese delegation to the conference, to report to you and the people of the whole country on the proceedings and achievements of the conference.

(I)

The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference is the fifth World Peace Conference since the first World Peace Congress in Paris-Prague in 1949. More than 1,200 delegates and observers from more than 70 countries and regions participated in this peace conference. They belonged to different social strata and had various social occupations, political views, and religious beliefs. The scale of the conference was quite large, and the representation was quite broad. It should be particularly pointed out that many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America sent important delegations to participate.

**The greatest gain of the conference was the strong condemnation of U.S. imperialism's aggression and the firm support for the anti-colonialist movement.**

The peace movement has been around for ten years. Although the movement has been developing and growing, the purpose and task of the peace movement have never been as clearly stated as at this conference. The peace movement is, without a doubt, a movement to prevent and treat the plague of war. Where is the root of war? It is obviously in the United States of North America, which leads the imperialist bloc. The U.S. regime is a dictatorship of monopoly capitalists. The U.S.'s world policy serves the monopoly capitalists. To put it more plainly, it is to serve the monopoly capitalists' excess and bloody profits. In order to maintain the excessive profits of a small number of monopoly capitalists, the U.S. government constantly implements the policies of arms expansion and war preparation, nuclear blackmail, and brinkmanship, and constantly strengthens international tension to advance its neo-colonialism. But the U.S. government is quite cunning; it habitually uses the pretext of resisting "communist subversive activities" to conceal its imperialist features and disguise itself as a compassionate savior to deceive the people of the world. Under the concerns of some Western friends, the peace movement for the past ten years has always been reluctant to openly expose this truth. It dared not explicitly oppose imperialist aggression and colonialism, and even the word "America" was treated with extreme caution. This has led the peace movement almost to take the path of unprincipled so-called pacifism.

However, at this conference, this kind of cloud was swept away, and the aggression of U.S. imperialism was clearly condemned, and the anti-colonialist movement was strongly supported. This should be the greatest gain of the conference, which is worth celebrating in particular.

The conference was held at an emergency time. On July 15, the day before the opening of the conference, the U.S. government took off its mask and sent its invading troops to land in Lebanon. On the second day of the opening of the conference, British invading troops also entered Jordan. The U.S. and British aggression against Arab countries, like a sudden outbreak of plague, seriously threatened peace in the Middle East and the world. Such a clear fact was placed before the people, which made it impossible for those who wanted to defend imperialism, to try to shift the target, and to reverse black and white to find any excuses. The Middle East situation shocked the world and immediately became the focus of attention of the representatives of various countries attending the conference. On the first day of the conference, all the representatives unanimously and in a timely manner adopted a resolution condemning the U.S. aggression against Lebanon and condemning the U.S., Britain, and Turkey for threatening peace in the Middle East. When the draft resolution was read out at the conference, the whole audience stood up and applauded warmly. Such a clear-cut representation of the will of the people of the world and the issuance of a strong condemnation was the first occurrence since the peace movement. In this way, the direction of the conference was also determined. In the various documents adopted after the conference, the aggression of the U.S. and Britain in the Near and Middle East was solemnly protested. The U.S. and British delegations also issued statements supporting the resolution of the conference, expressing their opposition to the aggressive actions of their own governments. As the "Letter to the People of All Countries in the World on the Situation in the Middle East" pointed out: "Whether from a legal or moral point of view, the aggression against the Middle East in violation of the United Nations Charter is indefensible. World public opinion is particularly shocked that the interference in the Middle East occurred after the report of the United Nations Secretary-General and United Nations observers clearly stated that the political crisis in Lebanon was a domestic issue without foreign interference. These actions should be condemned because they are the use of force against the people who are fighting to maintain their independence and sovereignty." The cunning U.S. government, which often uses the United Nations as its own tool of manipulation, this time impatiently threw the tool aside and threw itself into the net. The call to "stop U.S. aggression and safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world" resounded throughout the world and throughout the conference. The conference believed that in order to avoid the outbreak of a major war, the current serious situation in the Middle East must be resolved quickly and resolutely, and the primary condition is that the U.S. and British invading troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East and immediately stop interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries. The conference also responded to the Soviet Union's proposal, demanding that a summit meeting be convened immediately, and called on the United Nations to fulfill its responsibility to maintain world peace and stop the aggression of the U.S. and Britain. The seven-day conference, like a reservoir with its gates opened, poured its passionate torrent to where it should flow.

(II)

**The conference gave active support to the Arab people who are suffering from aggression and the threat of aggression.**

The aggression of the U.S. and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan thoroughly exposed the true face of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. This most clearly tells people where the threat of war comes from. At the same time, it further proves that the movement to defend peace is inseparable from the national independence movement. The Stockholm conference gave active support to the Arab people who are suffering from aggression and the threat of aggression. The representatives cheered the victory of the Iraqi revolution and firmly expressed their solidarity with the Lebanese and Arab people's struggle to maintain independence and sovereignty.

Iraqi representative Safa Hafez excitedly said at the conference: "Thanks to this inspiring revolution, the Iraqi people have shattered the Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Pact... The city of Baghdad has raised high the banner of world peace and international friendship. The word Baghdad is no longer related to a shameful treaty." Indeed, the victory of the Iraqi revolution disrupted the imperialists' aggressive backbone in West Asia, disrupted the imperialists' war plan in this region, and therefore was also a major victory for the cause of peace. The heroic struggle of the Arab people strengthened the peace movement, and the development of the peace movement, of course, also supported the Arab people's just struggle for national independence. At this conference, we saw a moving scene: the Arab people are not isolated, and their friends are all over the world!

More and more people have seen that the peace movement and the national independence movement have a common foundation and goal, which is to oppose the imperialist war of aggression. Only by opposing aggression can independence be won; only by maintaining independence can peace be won. The Stockholm conference not only supported the struggle of the Iraqi and Lebanese people, but also formally adopted a resolution in the National Independence Subcommittee to support the just struggle for national independence or to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Algeria, Indonesia, India, North Korea, Vietnam, French Equatorial Africa, Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, Madagascar, and Latin American countries. Facts have proved that the booming anti-colonialist movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is a huge force for peace. Once the peace movement and the anti-colonialist movement are combined, its mass base will be broader and its momentum will be greater. If some Westerners did not understand this truth before, then after the recent development of events, they have to admit it.

The anti-colonialist movement is not simply a movement of the people in colonies and semi-colonies, but should also become a movement of the people in colonial countries. The colonialist war of aggression policy also harms the real interests of the people in colonial countries and destroys peace. We believe that all peace-loving people should sympathize with and support the anti-colonialist struggle, and should unite and cooperate with the broad masses of the anti-colonialist people, oppose the common enemy, and strive to defend peace. We believe that the evil colonial system will be completely eliminated all over the world in the near future!

**The Latin American people stand at the forefront of opposing American colonialism.**

The power of the people is irresistible. In the current era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the victory songs of the people can be heard everywhere. Now, listen to the victory song of the Latin American people! The Latin American people stand at the forefront of opposing American colonialism. Currently, the angry tide of striving for national independence is generally rising. The Cuban people have achieved new victories in their struggle against American armed intervention in their internal affairs. The U.S. government's decision to send troops to invade Cuba to suppress the Cuban people has been temporarily forced to withdraw under the resistance of the Cuban people and the pressure of world public opinion. The Haitian people crushed the U.S. attempt to subvert the Haitian government on July 29. The Venezuelan people, who have achieved major victories in the struggle against the U.S. and dictatorial rule, once again crushed the conspiracy of reactionary elements supported by the U.S. more than ten days ago. Puerto Rico is a colony controlled by the U.S. for 59 years, and the struggle for national independence has seen new developments. Recently, the patriotic forces of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, three important countries in Latin America, have also made extensive progress. Latin America will not be the "backyard garden" of American aggressors for long. The Latin American people have lit the beacon to bury imperialism under the feet of American aggressors. Here, we want to cheer for the victory of the Latin American people's anti-colonialism!

(III)

**The representatives praised the Soviet Union's suspension of nuclear weapons testing and the measures taken by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to reduce troops; and condemned the United States for creating tension and aggravating the danger of war.**

The Stockholm conference also discussed the issue of disarmament, which is of concern to the people of all countries in the world. The Soviet Union's initiative to stop nuclear weapons testing has been praised by the people all over the world. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have further taken measures to reduce troops. China's initiative to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from North Korea has been praised by the representatives attending the meeting. But what about the head of imperialism—the United States? Not only does it not stop nuclear weapons testing and reduce troops, but it is also stepping up arms expansion and war preparation, expanding rocket and missile bases all over the world, letting planes carrying nuclear warheads fly in the airspace of other countries, and continuing to transport nuclear weapons into West Germany, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and China's territory of Taiwan occupied by the United States and other regions. The stark contrast makes people recognize the major issues of right and wrong. Many representatives condemned the U.S. for creating tension and aggravating the danger of war. The "Disarmament Declaration" adopted by the conference pointed out: This trend towards war and destruction must be firmly stopped. The first necessary measure is to immediately and unconditionally stop nuclear weapons testing. The Soviet Union has unilaterally stopped nuclear weapons testing, and the people of the world must not allow U.S. and British imperialism to put forward any reasons and excuses to quibble about continuing this testing; the U.S. and British governments cannot but bear serious responsibility for continuing this testing; the U.S. and British governments should follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately stop nuclear weapons testing! This solemn call, without a doubt, represents the common demands of the people of the world.

The Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which will be held in Tokyo, Japan, will further promote the struggle of the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world to stop atomic war and maintain peace.

**The Chinese people fully support this conference.**

Comrades, friends, here I want to focus on the issue of the Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which will open in Tokyo on the 15th of this month. The Japanese people are victims of the U.S. atomic bombing. In early August 1945, more than 300,000 peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, were innocently massacred by two U.S. atomic bombs. Today, you can still see the tragic scenes of atomic destruction and hear the groans of atomic victims. However, the war-mongers in Washington are still continuing their crazy policy of nuclear blackmail. Despite the occurrence of the Fukuryu Maru incident, and despite the repeated protests of the Japanese, Asian, Australian, and world people against the U.S. testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific, the U.S. government has always turned a deaf ear. From April 28 to July 26 this year alone, the U.S. has conducted 32 nuclear weapons explosions in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific high seas, and has also secretly conducted continuous underwater tests, thereby polluting the air and seawater in this vast area. The deposition of radioactive dust in the air in our country's southeastern coastal areas and other places has increased dramatically. On July 14, the Japanese ships "Takuyo" and "Satsuma," which were engaged in marine observation work on the sea surface near the equator, suffered from the disaster of radioactive dust caused by the U.S. nuclear explosion test, and 37 Japanese crew members suffered from life-threatening leukopenia. This is an unforgivable serious crime by the U.S. that endangers the lives of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of Asian and Australian countries in the Pacific region.

What is very strange is Japan's Nobusuke Kishi and his government. Nobusuke Kishi and his government are helping the evildoers and acting as accomplices; they welcome the U.S. turning Japan into a nuclear base, and further demand missiles from the U.S. to equip the Japanese army, and want to rely on U.S. power to revive Japanese militarism. They are willing to violate the will of the Japanese people and implement the so-called Northeast Asia military alliance policy, unite with Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, and serve the U.S. in promoting war plans in the Far East.

We believe that the Japanese people will not sincerely accept such a government. The Japanese people will not allow their country to be turned into a base for the U.S. to conduct atomic war.

We, the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, resolutely oppose such activities by the U.S. and the Nobusuke Kishi government that threaten peace in the Far East. We know that the Japanese people have launched a wide-ranging mass movement despite difficulties and obstacles, demanding that the U.S. and Britain follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately stop nuclear weapons testing, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, opposing the U.S. transporting aircraft and other weapons loaded with nuclear weapons, and opposing Nobusuke Kishi's collusion with the U.S. to arm the Japanese militarist army. The Chinese people distinguish between the peace-loving Japanese people and the Nobusuke Kishi government that is hostile to the Chinese people. The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the peace-loving Japanese people against nuclear weapons and against U.S. aggression. We wish their struggle complete victory!

We, the Chinese people, fully support the Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which will be held in Tokyo. We believe that this conference will further promote the struggle of the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world to stop atomic war and maintain peace. Let us wish the Tokyo conference greater achievements and make new contributions to the cause of peace.

(IV)

Comrades, friends, the Chinese delegation to the Stockholm conference completed the task entrusted to it by the people of the whole country and did its best for the success of the conference. In the speech of the Chinese delegation at the conference on July 18, it analyzed in detail the nature of the world peace movement, the source of the threat of war, and the basic principles of international cooperation, and fully expressed the Chinese people's high degree of optimism, sincere desire for world peace, and firm determination to defend world peace. Our speech was warmly welcomed by the representatives attending the meeting. When we reported at the meeting that tens of millions of people in our country held large-scale demonstrations and parades against the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism across the country, when we conveyed the news of our government's recognition of the Republic of Iraq, and when we introduced our people's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the representatives all stood up and applauded for a long time, expressing their warm welcome and congratulations.

**The Chinese people fully agree with the various resolutions on opposing aggression and defending peace adopted by the Stockholm conference, and are willing to strengthen unity with the people of all countries and take effective actions to jointly strive for the thorough implementation of the resolutions of the conference.**

Comrades, friends, the important reason for the success of the Chinese delegation at the peace conference should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party, to the people of the whole country who are making a great leap forward on the peaceful labor front with soaring revolutionary energy, and to the vigorous actions of the 640 million people in the country who protested against the aggression of the U.S. and British imperialism in the Near and Middle East. The rapid development of socialist construction in our motherland is the material basis of our movement to defend peace. This is the source of our confidence and strength. Please allow me to express my heartfelt respect to the heroes on all production and construction posts across the country under the leadership of the Party in the name of today's conference! Every ton of steel, every load of grain and cotton, every machine, every piece of cloth, every kilometer of railway and highway that you produce is a contribution to the movement to defend peace. Every miracle you create in factories, on farms, and on construction sites is a great encouragement to the peace-loving people of all countries in the world. Representatives of many countries have expressed their heartfelt joy for our achievements. Mr. Mohiuddin of the delegation of the United Arab Republic expressed the expectations and friendship of the peace-loving people towards the Chinese people. He said that your steel production is growing greatly at an alarming rate, "This is not only a great victory for the Chinese people, but also a great victory for the people of all countries in the world. Every time China becomes stronger, it is a contribution to the peace movement." Yes, the Chinese people will become stronger and stronger in socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we will use our labor and wisdom to build our motherland into the happiest country. The Chinese people fully agree with the various resolutions on opposing aggression and defending peace adopted by the Stockholm conference, and are willing to strengthen unity with the people of all countries and take effective actions to jointly strive for the thorough implementation of the resolutions of the conference.

Comrades, friends, what is most exciting is that three days ago, the communiqué of the meeting between our Chinese people's great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev, was published in Beijing. This shows that the friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is incomparably strong, and also shows that the unity of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp is unbreakable. The publication of the communiqué is undoubtedly a timely electric shock for the U.S. and British war maniacs and a great encouragement to the peace-loving people of all countries. The strength of the peace camp has been greatly increased. Indeed, "If the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and free countries and people will surely unite closely, thoroughly eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for lasting world peace."

Long live the great victory of the Asian, African, Latin American, and world people's struggle for national independence!

Long live the great victory of the struggle of the people of the world against aggression and for defending peace!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the unity of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live peace!

### 一次收获最大的世界和平大会  郭沫若在北京各界人民庆祝裁军和国际合作大会成功及支持第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会会议上的报告

    一次收获最大的世界和平大会
    郭沫若在北京各界人民庆祝裁军和国际合作大会成功及支持第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会会议上的报告同志们、朋友们：
    7月16日在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩举行的“裁军和国际合作大会”，已于7月22日胜利闭幕了。这次大会在反对美国侵略和支持反殖民主义的斗争方面，是和平运动开展以来，最成功、收获最大的一次会议。今天，我们北京各界人民在这里隆重集会，热烈庆祝这次大会的成就，并表示中国人民对大会决议的拥护和支持，请让我代表中国出席大会的代表团，向各位和全国人民报告大会的经过和它的成就。
    （一） 
    裁军和国际合作大会是1949年巴黎—布拉格第一届世界保卫和平大会以来的第五次世界和平大会。参加这次和平大会的，有来自七十多个国家和地区的一千二百多名代表和观察员。他们属于不同的社会阶层；有着各种不同的社会职业、政治观点和宗教信仰。大会的规模是相当宏大的，代表性是相当广泛的。特别应该指出的是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家都派遣了重要的代表团来参加。
    辞严义正地谴责了美帝国主义的侵略，坚强地支持了反殖民主义的运动，这是大会的最大收获
    和平运动已经有十年的历史了，尽管运动在不断地发展和壮大，但和平运动的目的和任务却从来不曾明确地像这次大会一样提出过。和平运动，毫无疑问，是预防和治疗战争瘟疫的运动。战争根源究竟何在？很明显地就在领导帝国主义集团的北美合众国。美国的政权是垄断资本家专政。美国的世界政策是为垄断资本家服务的。说得更明显一点，那便是为垄断资本家的超额的血腥利润服务。为了维持一小撮垄断资本家的超额利润，美国政府不断地执行着扩军备战政策、原子讹诈政策、战争边缘政策，不断地加强国际紧张局势，以推进它的新殖民主义。但美国政府是相当狡猾的，它惯以反抗“共产主义的颠复活动”为借口，掩盖着它的帝国主义的狰狞面貌，伪装成一个慈悲的救世主以欺骗世界人民。十年来的和平运动在一部分西方朋友们的顾虑之下，总是不肯公开揭露这种真相。对于反对帝国主义侵略反对殖民主义是不敢明确提出的，甚至于连美国字样都讳莫如深。这样就使得和平运动几乎走上了无原则的所谓和平主义者的道路。
    但是，在这一次的大会上把这一种乌云扫荡了，明朗地谴责了美帝国主义的侵略，并坚强地支持了反殖民主义的运动。这应该是大会的最大收获，值得我们特别庆祝。
    大会是在一个紧急的时期举行的。在大会开幕的前一天，即7月15日，美国政府自行揭下了它的假面具，派遣它的侵略军队在黎巴嫩登陆。在大会开幕的第二天，英国的侵略军队也开进了约旦。美国和英国对阿拉伯国家的侵略，就如突然爆发的瘟疫一样，使中东和世界和平受到了严重的威胁。这样鲜明的事实摆在人们面前，这就使得要替帝国主义辩护、企图转移目标、颠倒黑白的人也就无从借口了。中东局势轰动了全世界，也立刻成为了出席大会的各国代表们的注意焦点。在大会的第一天，全体代表就及时地一致通过了谴责美国侵略黎巴嫩，并谴责美国、英国、土耳其威胁中东和平的决议。当决议草案在大会上宣读完毕时，全场起立热烈鼓掌欢迎。这样旗帜鲜明地代表着世界人民的意志，发出辞严义正的谴责是自有和平运动以来第一次出现的事。就这样，大会的方向也就确定下来了。在大会以后通过的各项文件中，都严正地抗议了美国和英国在中近东的侵略。美国和英国代表团也发表声明，支持大会的决议，表示反对本国政府的侵略行为。正如“关于中东局势告世界各国人民书”所指出：“无论从法律根据还是从道义根据来说，中东发生的违反联合国宪章的侵略都是无法辩解的。世界舆论感到特别震惊的是，对中东的干涉发生在联合国秘书长和联合国观察员的报告明确说明黎巴嫩的政治危机没有外国的干涉而是国内问题以后，这些行动应该受到谴责，因为它们就是使用武力来反对为维护自己的独立和主权而奋斗的人民。”狡猾的美国政府，经常把联合国作为自己操纵工具的美国政府，这一次却迫不及待地把工具抛在一边，而自投罗网。“制止美国侵略、维护中东和世界和平”的呼声响彻了全世界，也响彻了大会。大会认为：为了避免大战的爆发，必须迅速、坚决地解决目前中东严重局势，而其首要条件，就是美国和英国的侵略军队立即从中东撤退，并立即停止对阿拉伯国家内政的干涉。大会更响应了苏联的建议，要求立即召开最高级会议，并呼吁联合国负起它的维护世界和平的责任，制止美国和英国的侵略，七天的大会，就这样像开了闸门的水库一样，热情的激流流到了它应该流到的地方。
    （二）
    大会对于正在遭受侵略和侵略威胁的阿拉伯人民，给予了积极的支持
    美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略彻底地暴露了帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的真正面目。这最清楚不过的告诉人们，战争的威胁究竟来自何处。同时它也进一步证明了，保卫和平运动同民族独立运动是分不开的。斯德哥尔摩大会对于正在遭受侵略和侵略威胁的阿拉伯人民，给予了积极的支持，代表们欢呼伊拉克革命的胜利，并坚决表示要声援黎巴嫩人民和阿拉伯人民维护独立与主权的斗争。
    伊拉克代表萨法·哈费尔在大会上兴奋地说：“由于这次振奋人心的革命，伊拉克人民已经粉碎了艾森豪威尔主义，粉碎了巴格达条约……巴格达这个城市已经高高升起了世界和平和国际友谊的旗帜。巴格达这个字眼已经同一个可耻的条约毫不相干了。”的确，伊拉克革命的胜利，打乱了帝国主义在西亚的侵略脊骨，打乱了帝国主义在这个地区的战争计划，因而也就是和平事业的重大胜利。阿拉伯人民的英勇斗争加强了和平运动，和平运动的开展当然也就支持了阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。在这次大会上，我们看到了一幅令人感动的景象：阿拉伯人民不是孤立的，他们的朋友遍于全世界！
    越来越多的人们都看到，和平运动和民族独立运动有着共同的基础和目标，那就是反对帝国主义的侵略战争。只有反对侵略，才能赢得独立；只有维护独立，才能赢得和平。斯德哥尔摩大会不仅支持了伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民的斗争，并还在民族独立小组委员会上正式通过了决议支持了阿尔及利亚、印度尼西亚、印度、朝鲜、越南、法属赤道非洲、喀麦隆、乌干达、怯尼亚、马达加斯加和拉丁美洲国家争取民族独立或维护国家主权与领土完整的正义斗争。事实证明，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲蓬勃发展的反殖民主义运动是一支巨大的和平力量。和平运动和反殖民主义运动一经结合，它的群众基础就会更加广阔，它的声势就会更加壮大。如果说这个真理，在以前还有某些西方人士不了解，那么经过最近事态的发展，他们也不得不承认了。
    反殖民主义运动不单纯是殖民地和半殖民地人民的运动，同时也应该成为殖民国家人民的运动。殖民主义的战争侵略政策同样危害殖民国家人民真正利益，破坏和平。我们认为，凡是爱好和平的人们，都应当同情和支持反殖民主义的斗争，都应当和反殖民主义的广大人民团结合作，反对共同的敌人，为保卫和平而努力。我们相信，万恶的殖民主义制度在不久的将来，一定要在全世界范围内彻底消灭干净！
    拉丁美洲人民站在反对美国殖民主义的最前哨
    人民的力量是不可抵抗的，在目前东风压倒西风的时代，到处都可以听到人民胜利的凯歌。现在请听拉丁美洲人民的凯歌吧！拉丁美洲人民站在反对美国殖民主义的最前哨。目前争取民族独立的怒潮正在普遍的高涨。古巴人民在反对美国武装干涉内政的斗争中取得了新的胜利。美国政府企图派遣军队侵入古巴以镇压古巴人民的决定，在古巴人民的反抗和世界舆论压力之下，已经暂时被迫撤销了。海地人民在7月29日粉碎了美国企图颠复海地政府的阴谋。在反对美国和独裁统治的斗争中取得了重大胜利的委内瑞拉人民在十几天前再次粉碎了受美国支持的反动分子的阴谋政变。波多黎各是被美国控制了五十九年的殖民地，要求民族独立的斗争又有了新的发展。最近拉丁美洲三个重要的国家阿根廷、巴西、智利的爱国力量也取得了广泛的进展。拉丁美洲不会长久是美国侵略者的“屋后花园”，拉丁美洲人民已经从美国侵略者的脚下，点燃起埋葬帝国主义的烽火。在这里，我们要为拉丁美洲人民反殖民主义的胜利而欢呼！
    （三）
    代表们赞扬苏联停止核武器试验和苏联以及其他社会主义国家所采取的裁减军队的措施；谴责美国制造紧张局势和加重战争危险的行动
    斯德哥尔摩大会也讨论了世界各国人民所关心的裁军问题。苏联主动地停止了核武器试验，是全世界人民所赞扬的。苏联同其他社会主义国家都进一步采取了裁减军队的措施，中国从朝鲜主动撤出中国人民志愿军，这些行动都受到了与会代表们的赞扬。但是帝国主义的首脑——美国是怎样呢？它不但不停止核武器试验和裁减军队，还正在加紧扩军备战、在世界各地扩建火箭导弹基地，让带着核弹头的飞机在别国领空中飞行，并继续把核武器运进西德、日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾和美国霸占着的我国领土台湾以及其他地区。鲜明的对照使人们认清了大是大非。许多代表都谴责了美国制造紧张局势和加重战争危险的行动。大会通过的“裁军宣言”指出：必须肯定地制止这种走向战争和毁灭的趋势。第一个必要的措施是立即无条件地停止核武器试验。苏联已经单方面地停止了核武器试验，世界人民决不能容许美英帝国主义提出任何理由和借口来为继续进行这种试验诡辩；美国和英国政府对于继续进行这种试验不能不负严重的责任；美国和英国政府应该效法苏联的榜样，立即停止核武器试验！这种庄严的呼吁，毫无疑问，是代表了全世界人民的共同的要求。
    即将在日本东京召开的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，将进一步推动日本人民和世界各国人民制止原子战争和维护和平的斗争。
    中国人民完全支持这次大会
    同志们，朋友们，在这里我要向你们着重谈到关于在本月15日在东京开幕的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的问题。日本人民是美国投掷原子弹的受害者。在1945年8月初旬，日本的广岛和长崎的三十多万和平居民无辜地遭受了美国两枚原子弹的大屠杀。如今还可以看到遭受原子破坏的惨景，还可以听到原子受难者的呻吟。但是，华盛顿的战争贩子们却仍然在继续疯狂的原子讹诈政策。尽管曾经发生过福龙丸事件，尽管日本、亚洲、澳洲和全世界人民一再抗议美国在太平洋试验核武器，但是美国政府始终充耳不闻。单从今年4月28日到7月26日，美国在太平洋公海马绍尔群岛就已经进行了三十二次核武器爆炸，而且还秘密进行了连续的水底试验，从而使这个广大地区的空气和海水都受到了污染。我国东南沿海等地空气中的放射性微尘沉降已有剧烈的增加。7月14日在赤道附近海面从事海洋观察工作的日本船“拓洋”号和“萨摩”号已遭受到美国核爆炸试验造成的放射性微尘的灾害，三十七名日本船员患了威胁生命的白血球减少症。这是美国危害中国人民、日本人民以及太平洋地区亚洲、澳洲各国人民生命安全的不能容恕的严重罪行。
    十分奇怪的是日本的岸信介和他的政府。岸信介和他的政府反而助纣为虐、为虎作伥；他们欢迎美国把日本变为原子基地，并更进一步向美国要求导弹来装备日本军队，想依靠美国势力来复活日本军国主义。他们甘心违背日本人民的意志，执行所谓东北亚军事联盟政策，和李承晚、蒋介石联合，为美国在远东推行战争计划效劳。
    这样的政府，我们相信，日本人民是不会心悦诚服的。日本人民不会容许把他们的国家变为美国进行原子战争的基地。
    美国和岸信介政府的这种威胁远东和平的活动，我们中国人民和亚洲各国人民都同样坚决反对。我们知道，日本人民不顾困难和阻挠，展开了广泛的群众运动，要求美英两国效法苏联的榜样立即停止核武器试验，要求撤销美国军事基地，反对美国运入装载核武器的飞机和其他武器，反对岸信介勾结美国武装日本军国主义军队。中国人民是把爱好和平的日本人民和敌视中国人民的岸信介政府区别看待的。中国人民完全支持爱好和平的日本人民反对核武器和反对美国侵略的正义斗争。我们祝他们的斗争取得完全的胜利！
    在东京即将召开的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，我们中国人民是完全支持的。我们相信这次大会将进一步推动日本人民和世界各国人民制止原子战争和维护和平的斗争。让我们预祝东京大会获得更大的成就，为和平事业作出新的贡献。

    同志们，朋友们，中国出席斯德哥尔摩大会的代表团，完成了全国人民所委托的任务，为大会的成功尽了自己的力量。在7月18日的大会上，中国代表团的发言，详细分析了世界和平运动的性质、战争威胁的根源和国际合作的基本原则，充分地表达了中国人民高度的乐观主义精神，对于世界和平的真诚愿望和保卫世界和平的坚定决心。我们的发言受到了与会代表们的热烈欢迎。当我们在会上报告我国几千万人民在全国各地举行声势浩大的反对美英帝国主义侵略的示威游行的情况，当我们传达我国政府承认伊拉克共和国的消息，当我们介绍我国人民在工农业生产上的大跃进，代表们都全体起立，长久鼓掌，表示了热烈的欢迎和祝贺。
    中国人民完全同意斯德哥尔摩大会所通过的反对侵略保卫和平的各项决议，并愿和各国人民加强团结，采取有效的行动，为彻底实现大会的决议而共同奋斗
    同志们，朋友们，中国代表团在和平大会上获得成功的重要原因，应该归功于党的正确领导，应该归功于正以冲天的革命干劲在和平劳动战线上大跃进的全国人民，应该归功于抗议美英帝国主义侵略中近东的全国六千四百万人大示威的轰轰烈烈的行动。我们祖国的社会主义建设的飞速发展，是我们保卫和平运动的物质基础。这是我们的信心和力量的源泉。请允许我用今天的大会的名义向在党的领导下在全国各个生产建设岗位上的英雄们表示衷心的敬意！你们生产的每一吨钢，每一担粮食和棉花，每一台机器，每一匹布，每一公里的铁路和公路，都是对于保卫和平运动的贡献。你们在工厂里，在农庄里，在建设工地上所创造的每一个奇迹，都是对于全世界各国爱好和平人民的巨大鼓舞。许多国家的代表都为我们的成就而感到衷心的喜悦。阿拉伯联合共和国代表团的毛希丁先生表达了爱好和平人民对中国人民的期望和友谊。他说，你们钢的产量正以惊人的速度大大增长，“这不仅是中国人民的一个伟大胜利，而且也是世界各国人民的一个伟大的胜利。每当中国变得更强大的时候，这就是对和平运动的一个贡献。”是的，中国人民将在社会主义建设中变得强大，更强大。在中国共产党的领导下，我们要用自己的劳动和智慧把祖国建设成为最幸福的国家。中国人民完全同意斯德哥尔摩大会所通过的反对侵略保卫和平的各项决议，并愿意和各国人民加强团结，采取有效的行动，为彻底实现大会的决议而共同奋斗。
    同志们，朋友们，最使人兴奋的是，在三天前我们中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志在北京的会谈公报发表了。这表示了中苏两国的友好同盟是无比坚强的，也表示了和平民主社会主义阵营的团结是牢不可破的。公报的发表，无疑，对于美英战争狂人是一种适时的电气休克，对于爱好和平的各国人民是极大的鼓舞。和平阵营的声势是无比壮大了。的确，“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民争取民族独立斗争的伟大胜利万岁！
    全世界人民反抗侵略、保卫和平斗争的伟大胜利万岁！
    中苏两国牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    和平民主社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    和平万岁！
