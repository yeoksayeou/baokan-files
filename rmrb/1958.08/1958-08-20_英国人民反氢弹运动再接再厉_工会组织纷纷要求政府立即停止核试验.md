Xinhua News Agency, London, August 18th: The British people's anti-hydrogen bomb movement is gaining momentum. Many trade union organizations are demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing and the establishment of missile bases in Britain, and are calling for a summit meeting.

British Trades Union Congress's annual meeting will be held next month in Bournemouth in southern England. Workers have put forward these demands in proposals prepared for the meeting.

The United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada is demanding that the British government immediately halt all nuclear weapons tests and take further measures to abolish all nuclear weapons and destroy all existing stockpiles.

The Chemical Workers' Union condemns "the government's allowing American planes carrying nuclear weapons to fly over Britain and the establishment of missile bases in this country."

The Draughtsmen's and Allied Technicians' Association in the engineering and shipbuilding industries expresses deep concern in its proposal about the continued testing and manufacturing of nuclear weapons by Britain and other countries. It believes that "the establishment of bases in this country from which to launch these weapons seriously threatens the safety of the British people and constitutes an obstacle to world peace."

The National Union of Civil Servants has submitted a proposal calling on the government to drastically reduce military spending. The proposal says that the current level of military spending of more than 1.5 billion pounds per year is the main cause of current inflation. The proposal says that the burden of military spending is imposing greater difficulties on wage earners and their families. It is undermining the economic foundations of Britain and putting the country in great danger.

Xinhua News Agency, London, August 19th: British parliamentarians and trade union leaders are fiercely opposed to the government's decision to conduct more nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island.

The "Daily Worker" published letters and conversations from British Labour Party members and trade union leaders on the 18th, expressing opposition to the government's decision.

Labour MP Griffiths said, "This is a shocking decision, and for those who hoped that Russia's abandonment of testing would mark the beginning of a more sober consideration of the danger that the irresponsible use of nuclear energy will bring to all mankind, this decision is a blow to them."

Another Labour MP, Swingler, said, "This is a regrettable, wasteful, and foolish decision, and I am sure that, especially in view of the UN report on the dangers of radioactivity, it is contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of British citizens."

The Electrical Trades Union President Foulkes said, "If the government continues to disregard the wishes of the people of this country to stop testing these instruments of death, the workers must take action in the only way they can to force the government to recognize the wishes of the people."

Some British bourgeois newspapers also oppose the government's decision. The "Manchester Guardian" said that the government's choice of such a time to announce this decision is a psychological blunder.

The "Daily Herald" said in an editorial today that the British government's decision to resume nuclear testing on Christmas Island is a cruel blow to the hopes of the people of the world.

The newspaper called Macmillan a "hydrogen bomb figure" and said, "Unless British public opinion breaks through the obstructionism of this misguided figure, he will stifle the hope of stopping the hydrogen bomb race from spreading too far to be contained."

　　英国人民反氢弹运动再接再厉
　　工会组织纷纷要求政府立即停止核试验
    据新华社伦敦18日电  英国许多工会组织纷纷要求禁止核武器试验和禁止在英国建立导弹基地，要求召开最高级会议。
    英国职工大会年会将于下月在英格兰南部的菩恩穆斯举行。工人们在为这个会议准备的提案中提出了这些要求。
    翻砂工人联合会要求英国政府立即停止一切核武器试验，并且采取进一步措施以废除所有核武器和销毁现有的一切储存。
    化学工人工会谴责“政府允许美国飞机携带核武器在英国上空飞行和在这个国家建立导弹基地”。
    机器制造业和造船业绘图员工会在提案中对英国和其他国家继续试验和制造核武器表示深切的忧虑。它认为，“在这个国家建立可以发射这些武器的基地严重地威胁英国人民的安全并构成对世界和平的障碍”。
    全国公务员工会提出提案，要求政府大力削减军事开支。提案说，目前的每年达十五亿英镑以上的军事开支水平是造成目前通货膨胀的主要原因。提案说，军费负担正把更大的困难强加在靠工资生活的人们和他们的家庭身上。它正在破坏着英国的经济基础并使国家濒于极大的危险。
    据新华社伦敦19日电  英国议员和工会领袖激烈反对政府决定要在圣诞岛进行更多的核武器试验。
    “工人日报”18日登载了英国工党议员和工会领袖的信件或谈话，表示反对政府的决定。
    工党议员格里菲思说，“这是令人吃惊的决定，对于那些希望俄国的放弃试验会标志着开始更清醒地考虑不负责任地使用核能将对全人类带来危险的人们说来，这决定是对他们的一个打击。”
    另一个工党议员斯文格勒说，“这是一个令人遗憾的、浪费的和愚蠢的决定，我可以肯定，特别是鉴于联合国关于放射性危险的报告，这是违反绝大多数英国公民的愿望的。”
    电气工会主席福尔克斯说，“如果政府继续不顾这个国家的人民希望停止试验这些死亡工具的愿望的话，工人必须用他们仅有的唯一办法采取行动，来迫使政府承认人民的愿望。”
    英国一些资产阶级报纸也反对政府这个决定，“曼彻斯特卫报”说，政府选择这样的时机宣布这个决定是心理上的失策。
    “每日先驱报”今天在社论中说，英国政府决定在圣诞岛恢复核试验，是给了世界人民的希望一个残酷的打击。
    这家报纸把麦克米伦叫做“氢弹人物”，并且说，“除非英国舆论击破这位误入歧途的人物的阻挠主义，否则，他会扼杀制止氢弹竞赛以免它蔓延过广无法制止的希望。”
