Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 10th: Recently, in the lecture hall of Shanxi Agricultural College, an old man in plain clothes and mountain shoes appeared. He introduced his forty years of sheep herding experience and his experience in breeding ewes to produce twin lambs, which shocked the teachers and students of the entire college. This old man has been hired by Shanxi Agricultural College as a professor in the Animal Husbandry Department's Livestock Teaching and Research Group.

This old man is a shepherd from the Waya Agricultural Cooperative in Houjiao, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, named Ning Huatang. Since 1953, the sheep he has herded have changed the general phenomenon of ewes producing single lambs, and many ewes have produced twin lambs every year. In 1955, among the twin pregnancies he arranged for twenty-eight ewes, twenty-six ewes gave birth to twin lambs. In the past four years, the lambing rate of the ewes he herded has been above 95%, and the survival rate of the lambs has also been above 95%.

Ning Huatang has accumulated a mature set of experiences in sheep herding. According to seasonal changes, pasture growth, and sheep development, he has explored the sheep herding rules for the four seasons: grazing on the sunny slopes in February and March, grazing on the shady slopes from April to August, grazing on the stubble fields in September and October, and grazing on the shady slopes again in December and January. Based on years of experience, he discovered that spring is the season for sheep to develop their bones and should avoid sheep running around. When grazing, he arranges the sheep into a "phoenix spreading its wings, with a single line turning its head." He found that summer and autumn are important seasons for the overall development of sheep throughout the year, so he grazes them by "driving the sheep to greet the sun in the morning, letting them eat cool grass when the sun turns red, making sure they eat hot grass at noon, and eating the leftover grass in the afternoon." This grazing method makes the sheep he herds grow fat.

Ning Huatang carefully studies the living habits of sheep. From the sheep's movements and bleating, he can judge what the sheep wants to do, and the flock often follows his actions. Once, when he was grazing sheep on a slope, he noticed that the sheep's eyes were fixed on him, and they were making "puff puff" sounds from their noses and mouths. After paying attention, he discovered wolves nearby, and he immediately took measures to protect the sheep from harm.

Ning Huatang's family has been herding sheep for landlords for four generations. He started herding sheep at the age of eight and has forty years of sheep herding experience this year. In the old society, his family relied on sheep herding for a living, his brother begged for food, his sister was sold, and his parents starved to death. The landlord knew he had the technique of mating ewes for twin lambs and tortured him in every possible way, but he did not tell. After liberation, his sheep herding experience was valued by the People's Government, and he quickly provided his experience to the agricultural cooperative. Governments at all levels have continuously sent people to help him summarize his experience.

Recently, Shanxi Agricultural College sent a professor and two graduating students to Ning Huatang's hometown to eat, live, and work with him, planning to help Ning Huatang write a "New Sheep Raising Science."

### 能者为师　山西老羊工宁华堂当了大学教授

    能者为师
　　山西老羊工宁华堂当了大学教授
    新华社太原10日电　在山西农学院的讲堂上，最近出现了一位衣着朴素、脚登山鞋的老人，他介绍了自己牧羊四十年和培育母羊产双羔的经验，震动了全学院的师生。这位老人已经被山西农学院聘请为畜牧系家畜教研组教授。
    这个老人是山西省陵川县后郊瓦窑农业社羊工，名叫宁华堂。从1953年以来，他所牧放的羊群，改变了一般母羊产单羔的现象，年年都有许多母羊产双羔的奇迹出现。1955年在他经手给二十八只母羊配的双胎中，有二十六只母羊下了双羔。最近四年，他放牧的母羊，产羔率都在95％以上，小羊的成活率也在95％以上。
    宁华堂在牧羊上积累了一套成熟的经验。他根据季节的变换、牧草的生长和羊的发育状况，摸索出了一年四季的牧羊规律是：2、3月里放阳坡、4至8月放阴坡。9月10月放地垛，腊月正月又阴坡。他根据多年的经验摸索到羊在春季是发育骨胳，应该避免羊乱跑，在放羊时他便把羊群排成“凤凰双展翅，回头一条线。”他发现夏秋两季是羊在一年中全面发育的重要季节，他便在牧放上“早晨赶羊迎太阳，太阳放红吃凉草，中午抓紧吃热草，后晌吃个回头草。”这种放牧的办法，使他牧放的羊一个个长得肥胖。
    宁华堂认真地研究羊的生活习惯，他从羊的动作和羊的叫声中，能判断出羊想干什么，羊群也常看他的动作行事。有一次，他在坡上放羊的时候，发现羊的眼睛都盯着他，并且从鼻子和嘴里都发出噗噗地声音。经过留神一看，结果在附近发现了狼，他便立即设法保护羊只不使损害。
    宁华堂四辈子都是给地主放羊的。他从八岁起开始放羊到今年已有四十年的牧羊经验。在旧社会他家靠牧羊生活，哥哥讨饭，妹妹被卖，父母活活饿死。地主知道他有配双羔的技术，曾百般折磨他，他也不讲。解放以后他的牧羊经验受到人民政府的重视，他很快把他的经验提供到农业社。各级政府不断派人去帮助他总结经验。
    最近，山西农学院派一位教授和两位本届毕业学生到宁华堂的家乡和他同吃同住同劳动，计划帮宁华堂著作一部“新养羊学”。
