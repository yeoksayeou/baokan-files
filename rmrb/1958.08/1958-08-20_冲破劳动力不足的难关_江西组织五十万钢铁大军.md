　　Breaking Through the Difficulty of Labor Shortage
　　Jiangxi Organizes a 500,000-Strong Iron and Steel Army
    Nanchang, August 19th (from our newspaper) The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a recent enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee, decided that the province should organize a 500,000-strong army for iron and steel production to develop iron and steel production.
    Labor shortage is one of the biggest difficulties for Jiangxi in developing iron and steel production. How to overcome this obstacle has become a matter of concern for Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi. Some cadres believe that the lack of labor for iron and steel production is an insurmountable difficulty. The reason is: agricultural Great Leap Forward has already felt the labor shortage, so where will the labor come from to engage in iron and steel production? Some believe that grain production is important, and iron and steel production is optional. People with this kind of thinking will not think of ways to solve the difficulty of labor for iron and steel production. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee believes that, for these people, to correct their thinking, it is necessary to emphasize putting iron and steel production in the position of "marshal". Once the ideological problem is solved, the difficulty of labor will naturally be solved. Facts have proved that the labor shortage is not an insurmountable difficulty. Yongxin County has more than 17,000 laborers engaged in iron and steel production every day. By August 1st, 84 iron smelting furnaces had been put into production, with a daily output of 50 tons of iron. The Provincial Party Committee requires all counties to learn from Yongxin's experience. At present, the province is launching a debate on solving the labor problem for iron and steel production. Through debate, many effective methods have been created to actively organize the iron and steel production army. Judging from the development of the situation, it may exceed the Provincial Party Committee's requirement of a 500,000-strong iron and steel army.

### 冲破劳动力不足的难关　江西组织五十万钢铁大军

　　冲破劳动力不足的难关
　　江西组织五十万钢铁大军
    本报南昌19日电  中共江西省委在最近举行的一次常委扩大会议上，决定全省组织五十万钢铁生产大军，发展钢铁生产。
    劳动力不足是江西发展钢铁生产的最大困难之一，如何冲破这一关成为江西各级党委注目的问题。有些干部认为：钢铁生产缺乏劳动力是不可解决的困难。理由是：农业大跃进已感到劳动力不足，那还有劳动力去搞钢铁生产呢？有的认为粮食生产重要，钢铁生产可搞可不搞。有这类思想认识的人，就不会想法解决钢铁生产劳动力的困难。所以省委认为：对这些人说来，要端正他们的思想，必须强调把钢铁生产提到“元帅”地位上来。思想问题解决了，劳动力困难就自然而然地解决了。事实证明，劳动力不足不是不可克服的困难。永新县每天有一万七千多个劳动力投入钢铁生产，到8月1日已有八十四个炼铁炉投入生产，可日产铁五十吨。省委要求各县学习永新的经验。目前，全省正在开展解决钢铁生产劳动力问题的辩论。通过辩论，创造许多有效的办法，积极组织钢铁生产大军。从形势发展看，可能超过省委提出的五十万钢铁大军的要求。
