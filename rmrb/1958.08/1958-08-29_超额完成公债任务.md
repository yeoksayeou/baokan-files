	Exceeding the Public Bond Task
	Starting from August 10th, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province launched a ten-day sprint campaign to exceed the 1958 public bond task. By August 15th, they had exceeded the task by 114.9%. Counties such as Baojing and Sangzhi completed the subscription and payment work in just two days. In recent days, people of all ethnic groups in Jishou County, dressed in festive costumes, carrying bond payments, and beating gongs and drums, reported good news and celebrated victory to the higher-level Party committees and governments.
	The fact that the entire prefecture quickly completed the public bond task dealt a heavy blow to those right-leaning conservative ideas that believed the economy in ethnic minority mountainous areas was not active and that public bonds could not be completed ahead of schedule.

　　超额完成公债任务
    湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州各族人民，从8月10日起，掀起了一个超额完成1958年公债任务的突击旬运动。到8月15日止，已超额完成任务114.9％。保靖、桑植等县，仅两天就完成了认购和交款工作。吉首县各族人民连日来，穿着节日盛装，抬着债款，敲着锣鼓，向上级党委和政府报喜祝捷。
    全州迅速完成公债任务的事实，给那些认为少数民族山区经济不活跃，公债不能提前完成的右倾保守思想，狠狠地打了一棒。
