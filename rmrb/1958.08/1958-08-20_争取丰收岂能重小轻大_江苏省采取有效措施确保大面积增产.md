　　Striving for a Bumper Harvest: Can We Emphasize the Small and Neglect the Large?
　　Jiangsu Province Takes Effective Measures to Ensure Large-Area Production Increase

　　(Our Dispatch) In the great inspection movement to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, Jiangsu Province discovered that the growth of crops in many areas was uneven, and some cadres were ideologically satisfied with high yields from small plots of land, neglecting field management of large areas. Responsible comrades from the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees promptly paid attention to correcting this situation during the inspection movement.

　　The seven district inspection teams in Jiangsu Province, composed of cadres at five levels, discovered in their recent half-month of inspection work that, although there were large areas of high-yielding fields everywhere for various mid- and late-autumn crops such as rice, cotton, corn, soybeans, and peanuts throughout the province, development was very uneven.

　　Some leading comrades emphasized the cultivation of small "satellite fields" while neglecting the management of large areas of farmland, or emphasized certain crops while neglecting others. The inspection team in the Xuzhou Prefecture found that more fertilizer was applied to the small "satellite fields" along the roadside and to those frequently visited, and the seedlings grew well. In remote areas with fields that were not often visited, there was a lack of fertilizer, poor management, and no one responsible. According to the inspection team's analysis, the reasons for this uneven phenomenon are three ideological obstacles: First, some cadres and masses have a small-peasant economy mentality of complacency and self-sufficiency. For example, the cotton in Sheyang County grew well in some places and poorly in others, but the grassroots cadres did not actively try to improve the poor conditions, saying, "One peach is enough for congee, and three peaches are enough for meat." It seemed that they were very satisfied with just three cotton bolls. Second, some cadres blindly believed in old conventions and experiences and were afraid to break with them boldly. For example, cadres in Xuyi County in the Huaiyin Prefecture said, "We have a vast area and a sparse population here, and there is no way to manage large fields well." Third, the unevenness of production reflected the unevenness of mobilizing the masses. A small number of cadres were afraid of doing arduous mass work. They were only willing to focus on advanced elements within a small scope and were afraid of backward elements. Therefore, in many areas, targets and measures did not become the conscious action of the masses.

　　In order to reverse this uneven phenomenon and strive for a large-area bumper autumn harvest throughout the province, the inspection teams took active measures. First, they promptly used the method of comparing good and bad to criticize ideas such as "emphasizing the small and neglecting the large," "complacency and self-sufficiency," "the autumn equinox determines the outcome," and "sitting and waiting for the harvest." Some areas mobilized the masses to pull out white flags and plant red flags, which quickly reduced the proportion of third-class seedlings. Second, they held on-site meetings to summarize experiences and use concrete facts to break the cadres' ideological superstitions. The Yancheng Prefectural Party Committee held a cotton on-site meeting in Sancang Township, Dongtai County, summarized the existing advanced experience in cotton late-stage management, and powerfully demonstrated that cotton does not stop developing after the autumn equinox but can continue to fully develop, thoroughly criticizing the erroneous argument that "the autumn equinox determines the outcome." Third, they mobilized the masses to carry out communist large-scale collaboration to eliminate large areas of third-class seedlings. Jianhu County drew 100,000 laborers from agricultural cooperatives with good production to support agricultural cooperatives with more third-class seedlings and a shortage of labor. They built more than 15,000 thatched sheds in the fields, lived in the fields, and launched a concentrated effort to strengthen field management. Taixing County organized work teams to station in third-class cooperatives to mobilize the masses and combine rectification to improve production. (Liang Guangliang, Bao Chunguang)

### 争取丰收岂能重小轻大　江苏省采取有效措施确保大面积增产

　　争取丰收岂能重小轻大
　　江苏省采取有效措施确保大面积增产
    本报讯  江苏省在争取秋熟丰收的大检查运动中，发现好多地区作物生长情况不平衡，部分干部思想上满足于小块田的丰产，忽视大面积的田间管理工作，省、地委负责同志在检查运动中及时注意扯转了这个情况。
    江苏省由五级干部参加的七个分区检查团，在最近半个多月的检查工作中，发现全省水稻、棉花、玉米、大豆、花生等各种中、晚秋作物虽然是到处都有较大面积的丰产田，但发展很不平衡。
    有些领导同志重视了小块卫星田的培植，忽视了大面积农田的管理，或者是重视某一项作物，轻视其他作物。徐州专区的检查团，发现在大路边，以及经常有人参观的小块卫星田就多施肥料，苗长得好；在偏僻地方没有什么人去看的田，就出现了肥少、管理差，无人负责的现象。造成这种不平衡现象的原因，根据检查团的分析，有三个思想障碍：第一，部分干部和群众有小农经济的自满自足思想。如射阳县的棉花生长好的好，坏的坏，基层干部不去积极地改变坏的情况，却说：“一个桃子吃粥，三个桃子就吃肉。”似乎有了三个棉桃就非常满足了。第二，有些干部迷信旧的陈规和经验，不敢大破大立。例如淮阴专区的盱眙县干部就说：“我们这里是地广人稀，大田管理没有办法搞好”。第三，生产的不平衡，反映了发动群众的不平衡。少数干部怕做艰苦的群众工作，他们只愿意在小范围内抓先进，对于落后的典型就畏难，因此，好多地区指标、措施没有成为群众的自觉行动。
    为了扭转这个不平衡的现象，争取全省秋熟获得大面积丰产，检查团采取了积极的措施。首先及时用好坏对比的方法，批判了“重小轻大”“自满自足”“立秋定局”“坐等收割”等思想。有些地区发动群众拔白旗，插红旗，也很快地减少了三类苗的比例。第二，召开现场会议，总结经验，用具体事实来破除干部思想上的迷信。盐城地委在东台县三仓乡召开棉花现场会议，总结了棉花后期管理方面已有的先进经验，有力地说明了棉花立秋以后，不是停止发育，而是能够继续充分发育，彻底地批判了“立秋定局”的错误论调。第三，发动群众进行共产主义大协作，来消灭大面积的三类苗。建湖县从生产搞得好的农业社内，抽调了十万个劳动力来支援三类苗较多、劳力又缺乏的农业社，在田头搭了一万五千多个草棚，住在田头，突击加强田间管理。泰兴县组织了工作组，驻到三类社去发动群众，结合整风来搞好生产。（梁光量  鲍春光）
