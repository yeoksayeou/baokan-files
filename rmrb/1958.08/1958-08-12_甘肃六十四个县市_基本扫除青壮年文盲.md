　　Gansu's Sixty-Four Counties and Cities
　　Basically Eliminate Illiteracy Among Young and Middle-Aged People
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th—It is reported that all sixty-four counties and cities in Gansu Province, except for the eight pastoral counties, have basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people.
    Among the 4.7 million young and middle-aged people in the sixty-four counties and cities of Gansu Province, 2.93 million illiterate and semi-illiterate people have been eliminated by the end of July. Together with the original 1.24 million literate people, the number of literate young and middle-aged people in the province has reached 4.17 million, accounting for 88.72% of the total number of young and middle-aged people. Among the counties and cities that have already eliminated illiteracy, in addition to the Han areas, the minority areas of Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, such as Hezheng, Kangle, Yongjing, Linxia City, and Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, such as Lintan and Zhouqu, have also eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people.
    The literacy campaigns in these areas have generally achieved leadership by the Party Secretary, full participation of the Party, mobilization of the whole people, and public management of schools, resulting in rapid progress and good quality. In terms of teaching methods, the principle of combining learning with production, adapting to the time, place, and people, and creating many flexible and diverse experiences has been implemented. In terms of teaching organization, in addition to attending classes in people's schools, various forms such as contract teaching and learning, door-to-door literacy instruction, blackboards in the fields, construction site study groups, family study groups, field studies, object labeling, and literacy manuals have been adopted to meet the requirements of concentrated breakthroughs, decentralized learning, and continuous consolidation.
    At present, all counties and cities are actively taking measures to consolidate the achievements of the literacy campaign and prevent relapse.

　　甘肃六十四个县市
　　基本扫除青壮年文盲
    据新华社兰州11日电　甘肃全省除牧区八个县外，其他六十四个县市已基本上扫除了青壮年文盲。
    甘肃省六十四个县市中有青壮年四百七十万人，到7月底，共扫除文盲、半文盲二百九十三万人，连同原有非文盲一百二十四万人，全省青壮年非文盲人数已达四百一十七万人，占青壮年总数88.72％。在已经扫除文盲的县市中，除汉族地区外，临夏回族自治州的和政、康乐、永靖、临夏市、甘南藏族自治州的临潭、舟曲等少数民族地区也扫除了青壮年文盲。
    这些地区的扫盲运动，一般都作到了书记挂帅、全党动手、全民动员、大家办学，因而速度快、质量好。在教学方法上，贯彻了学习和生产相结合，因时、因地、因人制宜，灵活多样地创造了许多经验。在教学组织形式上，各地除了在民校上课外，还有包教保学、送字上门、黑板下地、工地学习班、家庭学习组、田间学习、实物贴字和识字手册等多种形式，达到了集中突击，分散学习，随时巩固的要求。
    目前，各县、市正积极采取措施，巩固扫盲成果，防止回生现象。
