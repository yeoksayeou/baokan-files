New Evidence of "Indirect Aggression"
Tan Qinglu

The likes of Eisenhower, Dulles, and Lodge still cling to the so-called "indirect aggression" to this day, and, it is said, even want to bring it to the United Nations General Assembly, but they are struggling to find evidence. American columnist Walter Lippmann provided evidence of "indirect aggression" in an article, but it proves that the criminals engaged in "indirect aggression" are also the United States, which is engaged in direct aggression.

Lippmann's article is titled "A Dulles Plan" and was published in the "Washington Post" on August 5. Here are a few excerpts:

	"For my own part, I am dissatisfied and worried about the fact that we are being pushed blindly to a summit meeting. Because... Dulles is trying to prove, first, that the intervention in Lebanon and Jordan is legitimate. Second, he wants to reverse the situation and accuse the Russians and the people of the United Arab Republic of 'indirect aggression'..."

	"Those who would have Eisenhower listen to him should warn the President that if he thinks he can sway the summit with accusations of indirect aggression, he will make a big mistake... If the President becomes blindly self-righteous and tells the informed and skeptical world that we do not use what he calls indirect means of aggression... this will damage rather than enhance the President's moral credibility.

	"Panama will participate in the Security Council, and it will vividly remind the United States how the United States obtained the Canal Zone in order to dig the Panama Canal. Guatemala only recently experienced a successful coup, ousting the anti-American fellow traveler government, a coup that was publicly praised by Eisenhower himself. ... The President's condemnation of foreign interference in the current government will stifle Dulles' policy of liberating Eastern Europe. The obvious fact is that if we knew a way to overthrow the current government without risking a major war, we would be very happy to use it."

Lippmann's "dissatisfaction and worry" are justified. From Lippmann's words, no one can doubt his loyalty to the existing American system, let alone misunderstand that he is intentionally exposing the American trick of a thief crying "stop thief"; then, doesn't his "dissatisfaction and worry" just illustrate how absurd and unpopular the reactionary policies of the likes of Eisenhower and Dulles are?

In our view: Lippmann's testimony is powerful, but it still has the shortcomings of being "vague" or not thorough enough: First, although he confirmed that the recent successful coup in Guatemala was the result of American subversion—that is, indirect aggression, he did not dare to simultaneously confirm that the two unsuccessful coups that occurred more recently in Venezuela and Haiti were also caused by American subversion.

Second, although he confirmed that the Americans are very happy to use "methods that do not risk a major war to overthrow the current government," he did not dare to simultaneously confirm that the United States and Britain sent troops to Lebanon and Jordan precisely because they saw that this method was not working, and therefore adopted a method of direct aggression that risked a major war; he also did not dare to further confirm that the current deployment of American and British troops in the Middle East, and the dispatch of Murphy to carry out divisive conspiracies everywhere, is still to achieve its goal of "overthrowing the (Iraqi) current government without risking a major war" under the pressure of direct aggression.

However, since the former has already been confirmed, then the latter is naturally very clear.

    “间接侵略”的新证
    谭清露
    艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、洛奇之流的人，一直到现在还咬住所谓“间接侵略”不放，而且，据说还要把它搬到联合国大会上去，但却苦于找不到证据。美国专栏作家李普曼在一篇文章里提供了关于“间接侵略”的证据，但它证实的却是：从事“间接侵略”的罪犯，也是从事直接侵略的美国。
    李普曼这篇文章的题目是“一个杜勒斯方案”，发表在8月5日“华盛顿邮报”上。摘几段在下边吧：
      “在我自己看来，对于我们正在糊里糊涂地被往后推到最高级会议上去这一点感到不满和担心。因为……杜勒斯他努力想证明，第一，对黎巴嫩和约旦进行的干涉是合法的。第二，他想扭转形势，并且指责俄国人和阿拉伯联合共和国人进行‘间接侵略’……
    “会使艾森豪威尔听取他的意见的人应该警告总统，假如他认为他可以用间接侵略的控告来左右最高级会议的话，那么，他会犯一个大错……。假如总统变得盲目地自以为是，并且向了解情况的和抱怀疑态度的世界说，我们不使用他所谓的间接侵略的手段……这会损害而不会提高总统的道义信誉。
      “巴拿马将参加安理会，它将活生生地提醒美国，为了开凿巴拿马运河，美国是怎样取得运河地带的危地马拉仅仅最近才发生了一次成功的政变，赶走了反美的同路人政府，这个政变曾受到艾森豪威尔本人的公开赞扬。……总统谴责对现政府的外来干涉，这种谴责将会扼死杜勒斯解放东欧的政策。明显的事实是，假如我们知道一个不必冒巨大战争危险而可以推翻现政府的方法，我们会十分高兴地使用这个方法。”
    李普曼的“不满和担心”，是有道理的。从李普曼的话里，谁也不能怀疑他对美国现存制度的忠诚，更不会误认为他是在有意揭穿美国人贼喊捉贼的鬼把戏；那末，他的“不满和担心”，不就正好说明：艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流的人的反动政策如何的荒谬绝伦和不得人心吗？
    依我们的观点看来：李普曼的证词是有力的，但还有“语焉不详”或者说还不彻底的缺点：第一，他虽然证实了最近发生在危地马拉的一次成功的政变是美国人的颠复活动——即间接侵略的结果，但他没有敢同时证实，更近的，发生在委内瑞拉和海地的两次并不成功的政变，也是美国人的颠复活动所造成的。
    第二，他虽然证实了美国人十分高兴使用“不必冒巨大战争危险而可以推翻现政府的方法”，但他却不敢同时证实，美国和英国出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，正是看到这种方法行不通了才采取的一种甘冒巨大战争危险的直接侵略的方法；他也不敢进一步证实，目前美英陈兵中东，而又派墨菲去那里到处进行阴谋分化，仍然是想在直接侵略的压迫下，遂行其“不必冒巨大战争危险而推翻（伊拉克）现政府”的目的。
    但是，由于前者已经得到了证实，那末，后者自然也就是很明白的了。
