Marxism-Leninism Produces Grain
Responsible Person of Gansu Provincial Party Committee Discusses Experiences in Spring Wheat Abundant Harvest

(Our dispatch) Gansu people, displaying soaring enthusiasm, fought hard through winter and vigorously worked in spring and summer, overcoming drought and natural disasters, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of winter and spring wheat. The total output of over 18.15 million mu of winter and spring wheat in the province this year will reach at least 5.8 billion jin, and is estimated to possibly reach 6.3 billion jin; the yield per mu will reach a minimum of 320.5 jin, and possibly reach 348 jin. Even calculated with the minimum figures, the total output will increase by 101.3% compared to last year, and the yield per mu will increase by 105.8% compared to last year. Large areas of high-yield fields have emerged throughout the province, with 30 counties and cities achieving yields of 400 to 1,000 jin per mu, accounting for nearly half of the total number of counties in the province. Over 930,000 mu of wheat fields yielded over 1,000 jin per mu, accounting for approximately 5% of the total wheat sown area.

How did Gansu achieve such remarkable and astonishing results in winter and spring wheat this year? What are some of the experiences? Our reporter recently interviewed Comrade Huo Weide, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, on this issue. Comrade Huo Weide said that the unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat this year was not because of particularly favorable weather conditions. In the autumn of the previous year, the soil moisture was insufficient, and some wheat was dry-sown; in the spring of the following year, there was a prolonged drought, as well as frost and pest infestations. Therefore, we believe that the reasons for the abundant wheat harvest are mainly three: First, it is the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The Nanning and Chengdu Conferences and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China gave us many very important teachings and inspirations, enabling our work to avoid detours. Based on the spirit of the Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee, starting from the Party Congress in December last year, conscientiously summarized the lessons of the "saddle shape" throughout the province, extensively and deeply criticized the "Gansu Backwardness Theory," and launched a movement to pull out white flags and plant red flags from cities to villages. After the summer, we also launched a criticism of the "settling accounts after the autumn harvest faction." Through this series of struggles, we cleared out rightist elements in leadership organizations at all levels, criticized and educated comrades with serious right-leaning ideas, eliminated the three styles and five airs of leaders, and changed many rigid rules and regulations, thereby ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism and fully unleashing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. This is the main reason why we achieved an abundant wheat harvest.

Second, this year, Party and government departments at all levels adopted new leadership methods for agricultural production, namely on-site meetings, mass inspections and comparisons, and the convergence of five levels of cadres in the fields. Starting in April, the Provincial Party Committee adopted the method of a mobile headquarters, frequently holding meetings at lower levels, conducting many on-the-spot inspections, and making many important decisions. For example, the Zhuanglang Conference in April proposed comparing hard work, measures, progress, and actual results to overcome the contradiction between advanced targets and backward measures; the Wuwei Conference in May decided to launch a mass comparison movement centered on "four comparisons," promoting advanced elements to drive the overall situation and playing both the rectification and production gongs and drums well; the Weiyuan Conference in June decided to launch a mass production increase movement, striving for 1,200 jin of grain per person this year, and instructed the province to launch a province-wide debate on whether wheat can achieve high and abundant yields. Based on these decisions of the Provincial Party Committee, inspections and comparisons of 400-jin counties and three special districts were organized, further promoting the implementation of the decisions and instructions of the Provincial Party Committee in various localities. Due to such vivid and specific leadership, more labor was put into wheat growth this year than in any previous year.

Third, specific measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and management were better than in any previous year. This year's high-yield wheat fields were all fully irrigated, and fertilizer was generally increased by more than double compared to the past. Many wheat fields underwent soil improvement work such as paving, filling, siltation, or deep plowing last year. More than 80% of this year's wheat seeds were improved varieties, and the seeds were strictly disinfected and mixed with fertilizer before sowing, so the seedlings generally grew well, and pests and diseases were greatly reduced. Field management this year was also more thorough and meticulous than in previous years, and winter moisture conservation, spring frost prevention, summer pest control, disease prevention, flood prevention, and lodging prevention were all done well. In particular, the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on "three waters, three fertilizers, and three hoeings" were implemented, and a movement to expand first-class fields, improve second-class fields, and eliminate third-class fields was launched, resulting in a huge change in the proportion of first, second, and third-class wheat fields. Therefore, this year's abundant wheat harvest is due to the unlimited power of Marxist-Leninist theory and the full发挥of people's subjective initiative.

The fact that the province's wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year also tells us: there are no low-yield crops and poor land, only low-yield thinking and poor farming methods. If we change our thinking, change our farming methods, invest enough labor in the land, and give it enough nutrition according to the needs of the crops, any crop and land can achieve high and abundant yields.

　　马列主义出粮食
    甘肃省委负责人谈春小麦丰产经验
    本报讯　甘肃人民发挥了冲天干劲，苦战一冬，大干一春一夏，战胜了干旱和自然灾害，冬、春小麦获得了空前大丰收。全省一千八百一十五万多亩冬、春小麦，今年总产量至少可达到五十八亿斤，估计可能达到六十三亿斤；亩产量最低可达到三百二十点五斤，可能达到三百四十八斤，即以最低数字计算，总产量将比去年增长101.3％，亩产量将比去年增长105.8％。全省出现了大面积高产田，亩产四百斤到一千斤的县市有三十个，占全省总县数的将近一半。亩产千斤以上麦田九十三万余亩，约占小麦总播种面积的5％。
    甘肃今年冬、春小麦是怎样取得显著惊人的成绩的？有些什么经验？记者最近就这个问题访问了中共甘肃省委书记霍维德同志。霍维德同志说，今年的小麦能够获得空前大丰收，并不是今年天时特别好。头年秋季地墒不足，有些小麦是干种的；第二年春季长期天旱，又有霜冻和病虫侵袭。因此我们认为取得小麦丰收的原因主要有三：一、是党中央和毛主席的正确领导。中央召开的南宁、成都会议和八大二次会议给了我们很多非常重要的教导和启发，使我们的工作避免了弯路。省委根据中央精神，从去年12月党代表大会开始，就在全省范围内认真总结了马鞍形的教训，广泛深入地批判了“甘肃落后论”，从城市到农村展开了拔白旗插红旗运动，夏季以后还开展了对
  “秋后算账派”的批判，经过这一系列斗争，清除了各级领导机构中的右派分子，批评教育了右倾思想严重的同志，打掉了领导者的三风五气，改变了很多清规戒律，从而使党的建设社会主义的总路线得到正确贯彻执行，群众的积极性、创造性得到了充分发挥。这就是我们取得小麦丰收的主要原因。
    二、今年各级党政部门对农业生产采取了新的领导方法，即现场会议、群众性的检查评比、五级干部会师田间等。省委从4月份开始，即采取流动司令部办法，经常到下边开会，进行过很多实地检查，作出了很多重要决定。如4月庄浪会议，提出比苦干、比措施、比进度、比实效以克服先进指标与落后措施之间的矛盾；5月武威会议决定开展以“四比”为中心的群众性评比运动，推广先进带动全面，把整风生产两套锣鼓都打好；6月渭源会议决定开展群众性增产运动，力争今年每人有粮一千二百斤，并指示全省展开小麦能否高额丰产的全民大辩论。根据省委这些决定，又组织了四百斤县检查评比，三个专区检查评比，进一步促进了各地对省委决定指示的贯彻执行，由于这样生动具体的领导，所以使今年小麦在生长过程中，比以往任何一年都多加了工。
    三、水、肥、土、种、管等具体措施比以往任何一年都好。今年丰产麦田都是经过充分的灌溉，肥料普遍比以往增加了一倍以上，很多麦田去年都经过铺砌、填土、淤泥或深翻地等土壤改良工作。今年小麦的种子80％以上是良种，下种前种子都经过严格消毒和肥料拌种，因此，幼苗一般生长较好，病虫害大为减少。今年的田间管理也比往年周到细致，冬季保墒、春季防霜、夏季防虫、防病、防洪、防倒伏都做得较好。特别是贯彻执行了省委三水三肥三锄指示，开展了扩大一类田，提高二类田，消灭三类田的运动，使小麦一、二、三类田的比例发生了极大的变化。因此今年小麦的丰产，是由于马克思列宁主义理论的无限威力和人的主观能动作用的充分发挥。
    今年全省小麦空前丰收的事实还告诉我们：没有什么低产作物和不良土地，只有低产思想和不良的耕作方法。如果改变了思想，改变了耕作方法，给土地投进足够的劳动，按照作物的需要给它足够的营养，任何作物和土地都可以出现高额丰产。
