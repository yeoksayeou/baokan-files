　　Like Family, Like Friends
　　—Sights at the Beijing Department Store
　　By Our Correspondents Lei Runming and Zhou Dingfang
    The Wangfujing Department Store (Baihuo Dalou), on Wangfujing Street in Beijing, is the capital's largest department store. Here, from morning till night, people flow in an endless stream, including not only local customers but also visitors from other parts of the country and foreign friends from distant lands.
    In the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, this store has undergone profound changes. Here, a new type of relationship has emerged within the socialist family, one of mutual respect and love. The following are excerpts of our observations at this store.
    The Blind Man's Gratitude
    A blind man in his thirties came to the Western medicine section. "Is this the Western medicine section?" "Yes, comrade, what medicine would you like?" The young female salesperson greeted the blind customer warmly. "I want penicillin ointment and aspirin." "Okay, please wait a moment, I'll get them for you right away." Soon the medicine was wrapped and handed to him.
    The customer didn't leave immediately after taking the medicine, as if he had something else to do. Seeing this, the salesperson asked him, "Comrade, would you like to buy anything else?" "Yes, I want to buy clothes. Can you tell me where the clothing section is?" "On the second floor." Saying this, the salesperson came out from behind the counter, took the customer's arm, and said, "I'll take you there. It's crowded, and you have to go upstairs. You can't do it yourself." "No, no, I can go myself." The customer tried to pull away. "Comrade, don't be so polite, let's go!" She supported the customer as they slowly walked up the stairs. If she wasn't wearing the white salesperson's uniform with a number on it, anyone seeing this scene would have thought she was the blind man's relative.
    The clothing section salesperson, Feng Wentian, described the color, quality, and price of almost all the clothes to the blind man and helped him try them on, one after another. "How about this Shanghai navy blue cloth? It's bright, doesn't fade, is sturdy, and cheap, and the size is right too." "Okay, wrap it up!" As Feng Wentian wrapped the clothes, he asked the customer, "Comrade, would you like to buy anything else? Tell me, and I'll take you there." He originally wanted to buy some children's toys, but he was too embarrassed to say it. Feng Wentian said, "What else would you like to buy? Tell me, I'm not busy now, I can take you." The customer said, "Comrade, you are too kind. I can go buy some toys for the kids myself, I don't want to trouble you anymore." Although he declined repeatedly, Feng Wentian still took him to the children's toy section and helped him choose toys. Finally, he carried the customer's things and escorted him all the way to the gate. At the time of parting, the blind man tightly grasped Feng Wentian's hand, his eyes filled with tears of gratitude.
        "Just Like Being at Home!"
    An old lady was sitting in a corner on the first floor, panting heavily. She told her daughter who had come with her, "The woolen cloth section is on the third floor. My body can't take it; I can't go up. Go up and see if there is any material suitable for me to wear?" The old lady originally intended to come here to have a woolen coat made, but she was so tired she was panting after just walking to the first floor. She changed her mind, first asking her daughter to go up and look at the materials, and then go up to the third floor to get measured when she felt better in a few days.
    The woolen cloth section salesperson, Wang Jiusi, followed the young female customer who had just gone upstairs. She stopped in front of a large bundle of dark blue wool.
  "Would you like to make clothes out of this material?" Wang Jiusi asked. "No, not for me." "For whom?" "My mother." "This color is good for older people. Did the old lady come?" "Yes, but she's not feeling well and can't come up. She's waiting on the first floor. Can you go down and measure her?" "Of course." Saying this, Wang Jiusi carried two bundles of wool and went downstairs, followed by a tailoring worker carrying scissors and a ruler.
      "Mom, these two comrades have come to measure your clothes." The old lady, who was waiting for her daughter, saw the salesperson carrying the wool and the tailor with the scissors approaching her, and quickly stood up. Wang Jiusi put down the wool he was carrying on his shoulder and asked the old lady, "How does this look?" The old lady said, "This color is simple, elegant, and very good."
    After the clothes were measured, Wang Jiusi and the tailor went back upstairs. The old lady excitedly told her daughter, "This store is just like being at home, it's so good, I never expected them to come down."
        "Take it Wherever You Go!"
    On a sofa in the shoe department, a Soviet woman in her thirties was trying on high-heeled shoes. Beside her feet were already more than a dozen pairs of various styles of high heels, but none of them suited her. She gently said to the salesperson:
  "I want to buy a pair of shoes with four-inch heels, but I've been to five shoe stores and haven't been able to find any. Can you think of a way to help me?" After listening to the translator's explanation, the salesperson learned that the Soviet woman was a ballet dancer named Mesovskaya, who had been dancing ballet for over twenty years, and her foot shape had changed. The heels of the shoes she wore were twice as high as ordinary high heels. Hearing this and looking at the disappointed expression of the Soviet friend, the salesperson resolutely said, "We will definitely find a way to customize a pair for you and ensure your satisfaction." That day, the salesperson went to the shoe factory to discuss the Soviet friend's foot shape and manufacturing methods with the technicians and workers.
    A few days later, the Soviet woman came to try on the newly made shoes. She put on the shoes and couldn't help but stand on tiptoe and twirl around a few times, excitedly saying:
  "Wonderful! Wonderful! These shoes are more comfortable than any of the pairs I've worn in the past." She asked to buy the last and the design of the shoes as well, saying, "This is the Chinese people's friendship towards me. I must keep it safe and take it wherever I go."
            Salesperson's Diary
    Many of the salespeople at this store tell us that their greatest happiness and comfort is satisfying customers. This noble aspiration encourages them to diligently study their profession, learn from the advanced, and do everything possible to make things convenient for customers. Many salespeople at this store are writing books and diaries to summarize their experiences and write about their work insights and feelings. Below is an excerpt from a salesperson's diary:
    "Two sisters came with their parents to buy sweaters. The older girl said, 'Mom, buy me that pink one, it's so pretty!' The mother didn't express agreement or disagreement. Judging by her expression, she was particularly interested in the rose-colored one. I said, 'The rose-colored one looks best on girls, it's both beautiful and doesn't get dirty easily.' So they bought the rose-colored one for the older girl. The mother then asked the younger girl what color she liked, but the child couldn't say what looked good. So I said, 'How about the emerald green one? The two sisters wearing these two colors of sweaters will look particularly bright and beautiful standing together.' They were very satisfied with my suggestion and also bought the emerald green one.
    As they were about to leave, the mother told the children, 'Thank you, uncle, and say goodbye to uncle!' At that moment, my heart felt warm. I smiled and nodded goodbye to them, and I looked at their retreating figures, thinking: How happy this family is in these peaceful days, and how meaningful my work is!" (Attached illustrations)

　　像亲人似朋友
　　——北京百货大楼见闻
　　本报记者　雷润明　周定舫
    北京王府井大街上的王府井百货商店（百货大楼），是首都最大的百货商店。在这里，从早到晚，人群川流不息，不只有本地的顾客，也有外地来京的客人，也有来自遥远国度的外国朋友。
    在全民大跃进的洪流里，这个商店发生了深刻的变化。在这里已是社会主义大家庭中人们互敬互爱的新型的关系。下面就是我们在这个商店见闻的片断。
    盲人的感激
    一位三十岁左右的盲人来到了西药部，“这是西药部吗？”“是，同志，你想要什么药？”年轻的女售货员亲切地接待着这位双目失明的顾客。“我要盘尼西林药膏，阿司匹林。”“好，请你等一下，我马上拿来。”很快药品就包好，交给了他。
    这位顾客拿了药没有马上离开，好像还有什么事要办。看到这种情景，售货员就问他：“同志，你还想买什么吗？”“是啊，我想买衣服，你告诉我卖衣服的在哪里？”“在二楼。”说着售货员就走出了柜台，搀着顾客的手臂说：“我带你去，人多，还要上楼，你自己不行。”“不，不，我可以去。”顾客想挣脱开自己走。“同志，你不要客气，走吧！”她搀扶着顾客慢慢走上了楼梯。假如她不是穿着带有号码的白色售货员工作服，看到这种情景，会认为她是盲人的亲人。
    服装部的售货员冯文田，几乎把所有服装的颜色、质量、价钱都向这位盲人做了介绍，并帮他试穿，试了一件又一件。“就要这件上海毛蓝布的吧，鲜亮，不褪色，又结实，又便宜，尺寸也合适。”“好，你包上吧！”冯文田一面包衣服，一面问顾客：“同志，还想买什么东西吗？告诉我，我领你去。”他本来还想买点儿童玩具，但这时他不好意思说了。冯文田说：“还想买什么，说吧，我现在不忙，可以带你去。”顾客说：“同志，你们太好了，买点小孩玩艺我可以去，不再麻烦你了。”他虽然一再推辞，可是冯文田还是领着他到了儿童玩具部，帮他挑选了玩具。最后他给这位顾客拿着东西，一直送出了大门，分手的时候，这位盲人紧紧地抓住冯文田的手，两眼含着感激的泪花。
        “真像自己的家一样！”
    在一楼的一个角落里坐着一位老太太，气喘不息，她告诉同来的女儿说：“呢绒部在三楼，我身子不行，上不去，你上去看看有什么我穿着合适的料子？”老太太本来打算到这里来作个呢料上衣，但刚走到一楼就累的喘气，她改变了主意，先叫女儿去看看料子，过几天身体好些后再上三楼去量尺寸。
    呢绒部的售货员王九思，一直跟随着刚上楼的年轻的女顾客，在一大捆藏蓝色的呢子面前她停下了。
  “想做这个料子的衣服吗？”王九思问。“不，不是我做。”“谁做？”“妈妈。”“这个颜色老人穿好，老人家来了吗？”“来了，她身体不好，上不来，在一楼等着呢，能下去给她量量尺寸吗？”“完全可以。”说着，王九思扛着两捆呢子就下了楼，剪裁工人拿着剪刀和尺子跟在后边。
      “妈妈，这两位同志给你量衣服来了。”正在等着女儿的老人，看到走到她眼前的、扛着呢子拿着剪刀的售货员，急忙站了起来。王九思放下肩上扛着的呢子，问老太太：“怎么样？”老太太说，“这个颜色素净、大方，很好。”
    衣服剪完了，王九思和剪裁工人也上楼去了，老太太激动地告诉自己的女儿说：“这商店真像自己的家一样，太好了，真没想到他们能下来。”
        “走到那里带到那里！”
    在皮鞋部的沙发椅上，一位三十多岁的苏联妇女正在试穿高跟皮鞋。脚旁已经放着十几双各种式样的高跟鞋，没有一双是她中意的。她轻轻地对营业员说：
  “我想买一双后跟高四英寸的鞋，跑了五家鞋店都没有买到，您们能给我想什么办法吗？”营业员听了翻译的介绍，才知道这位苏联妇女是芭蕾舞蹈家梅索夫斯卡娅，跳了二十多年芭蕾舞，脚型已经变了。她穿的鞋比一般高跟鞋要高一倍。营业员听到这里，再望望这位苏联朋友失望的表情，毅然地说：“我们一定想法给您定制一双，保您满意。”当天，营业员就到皮鞋加工厂去，和技术人员、工人共同研究这位苏联朋友的脚型，商量制造办法。
    隔了几天，这位苏联妇女来试穿新制的皮鞋。她穿上皮鞋，情不自禁地踮起脚尖转了几圈，兴奋地说：
  “太好了！太好了！这双鞋比我过去穿的几双都舒服。”她要求把制样的鞋楦和样子也买了去，她说：“这是中国人民对我的友谊，我一定要把它很好地保存起来，走到那里，带到那里。”
            售货员的日记
    这个商店的许多售货员告诉我们，他们最大的幸福与安慰是使顾客满意。这样一个崇高的愿望鼓舞着他们刻苦地钻研业务、学习先进，千方百计地便利顾客。这个商店很多售货员在用写书、写日记的方式，来总结自己的经验，写自己工作的心得和感受，下面就是一个售货员的一段日记：
    “两姊妹跟着爸爸妈妈来买毛衣，大女孩说‘妈妈，给我买那件粉红的吧，多好看啊！’妈妈没表示同意或不同意。看气色，她对玫瑰的特别感兴趣。我说：‘女孩子穿这玫瑰的最漂亮不过啦，既好看又经脏。’他们就给大女孩买了玫瑰红。妈妈又问小女孩喜欢什么颜色，孩子说不出什么好看。我就说：‘看看翠绿的吧，姊妹两个穿着这两色毛衣，站在一起显得格外鲜艳漂亮。’他们对我的介绍非常满意，就又要了翠绿的。
    当他们要走时，妈妈告诉孩子说：‘谢谢叔叔，和叔叔说再见！’当时我心里觉得暖烘烘的，向他们含笑点头告别，我望着他们的后影想：在这和平的日子里，这一家有多幸福，我的工作多么有意义啊！”（附图片）
