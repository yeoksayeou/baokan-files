　　Next, it is necessary to resolutely implement the struggle between the two roads and two lines in the great cultural revolution and technical revolution, thoroughly break the superstition of technology, and break the right-leaning conservative idea of ​​completely relying on a few bourgeois artists or famous artists to develop the art industry. The technology of various art departments is also the accumulation of human labor experience and the result of long-term mental labor. Technology is constantly enriched in continuous artistic practice, in expressing diverse content, especially in showing the new life of an era. Therefore, technological growth is also a wealth created by human collectives. The level of individual technology is due to the inheritance of the legacy of predecessors, the guidance of teachers, the influence of the collective, and the result of individual hard work. It is not the "innate" talent of some "genius" artist. The broad masses of workers and peasants have not undergone strict training in technology, and there are not many opportunities to engage in artistic practice, but because they have a rich artistic heritage among the people and are full of talent for expressing life, they can show amazing creativity in art and possess certain expression skills. The growth of China's hundreds of thousands of opera and balladry teams also fully illustrates how the vast number of artists spontaneously engaged in a large-scale struggle to learn opera and balladry and strive to master technical skills in order to survive under the conditions of insufficient teacher education before liberation.
　　The conservative idea of ​​not following the mass line and only relying on a few experts or famous artists to run the art industry is linked to the idea of ​​overly superstitious technology.
　　Some bourgeois artists and famous artists have a high level of professional skills and technical ability. We should respect them, give full play to their potential to serve workers, peasants and soldiers, and let them be responsible for training young cadres. Therefore, in the past, our emphasis on young people learning from them was still correct. The problem is that we did not implement the mass line and asked young people to dare to raise questions in their studies, oppose these experts' ideas of separating from politics, separating from the masses, and separating from reality in teaching, and their conservative ideas of refusing to carry out technological innovation. Instead, a few bourgeois experts spread the mysterious view of technology, conservative thinking, and technical supremacy, unscrupulously expanding its position. Famous artists are even more worthy of respect, because they are the inheritors and disseminators of national art, and also developers. Underestimating them is harmful to the development of national art, but can we rely only on them without relying on the vast art team to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new? This makes me think of a question. Before liberation, the vast number of artists were oppressed and discriminated against in terms of political status, social life, and economic life; in addition, in many famous actors' "self-respecting" troupes at that time, the creativity of ordinary actors was also greatly restricted and suppressed. The situation has now changed. Many opera troupes are more active in artistic creation, mainly due to the combination of leaders, leading actors and ordinary actors, giving full play to the collective spirit. The view of mystifying art and regarding art as a rare commodity is a characteristic of bourgeois artistic thought. Superstition in technology and superstition in a few people are ideological obstacles to the stagnation of art. In the past, we only relied on a few experts, and as a result, the work of nationalizing and popularizing European art forms could not be carried out for a long time, and the work of improving national art was also circling among a few people, and the results were not large enough. If we can break the superstitious view and mobilize hundreds of thousands of artists and young art workers to carry out technological innovation work, I think that the momentum will be very amazing, and the process of reforming and improving national art and nationalizing and popularizing new literature and art will definitely accelerate. Developing the art industry in a faster, better and more economical way, realizing the great popularization of art, and continuously improving on the basis of popularization, and gradually achieving the great task of "great improvement" can never be accomplished by a few people alone. In the future, on the one hand, we still need young art workers to learn professional skills from experts and famous artists to improve their technical capabilities, but in terms of ideology, we should pay more attention to giving play to the enthusiasm and creative spirit of the vast number of young art workers and the vast number of artists, so that more people can come up with more ways to master technology, improve professional skills, and create socialist art. Young people are full of vigor and enterprising spirit. As long as they are well guided to improve their political and ideological awareness and pay attention to the combination of being red and expert, we can let them master technology, reform technology, and develop technology. Now many young writers, young actors, and singers can "surpass their predecessors." As long as the reform of technology is combined with political tasks to form a mass movement, instead of only talking about professional work and not talking about politics, and training a small number of people behind closed doors, I believe that technical supremacy and fame and fortune will never develop, and even if they are discovered, they can be overcome.
　　It is necessary to follow the mass line in professional art teams, and the mass line should be implemented even more in the amateur art activities of workers, peasants and soldiers. The current great leap forward in mass art fully illustrates this point. The ownership of the means of production has changed, the masses have been ideologically liberated, and productivity has been improved. They use their labor to reform the "poor" and also use their labor to reform the "white." Their creative enthusiasm is particularly great, and their creative talents are amazing. In the past, I also had a mystified view on how to create socialist national new art. It seemed that only a few famous writers, famous painters, famous artists, and some art groups with higher professional skills had the conditions for creation. I never thought that the process of combining popularization and improvement was also the process of continuous creation and continuous development of socialist national new art, and I never thought that the great popularization of revolutionary art and the extensive development of mass art activities were the most solid foundation for creating and developing socialist national new art. We must use the style of mass art to transform the style of experts, and use the creation of the masses to promote the improvement of professional art level. We must use the creative achievements of worker-peasant artists and young professional art workers to educate and transform bourgeois artists. I think that as long as worker-peasant artists continue to emerge and young artists who are both red and expert grow up quickly, those bourgeois artists who do not want to reform will not be able to transform their thinking and change their artistic style under this compelling situation.
　　Regarding the ideological transformation of bourgeois artists and the vast art team, in terms of specific measures, I have initially thought of the following points:
　　Going deep into actual struggles and going deep into the masses of workers and peasants is the most important and fundamental way to transform the ideology of the art team. Playwrights, composers, and painters should often be at the grassroots level. Other art performers and researchers should also leave their current jobs for a certain period of time, break the small circle of intellectuals, and disperse into the sea of ​​workers and peasants, focusing on physical labor and concurrently engaging in grassroots cultural work, or focusing on grassroots cultural work and participating in physical labor at the same time. This is a relatively effective way to transform ideology. Some people who have difficulty leaving their jobs to work can take the method of participating in voluntary labor on a regular basis and participating in physical labor during touring performances and tutoring mass art activities. There can be various methods, but the purpose is to transform oneself among the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, and to transform oneself in labor.
　　Putting creation and performance directly for workers, peasants and soldiers in the first place. Delivering it to their doorsteps and performing directly for workers, peasants and soldiers should account for at least three or four months of each year. Some troupes perform in rural areas and factories most of the time. In theater performances, worker-peasant-soldier audiences should also be organized in a planned way, and convenient conditions should be created for them to watch operas. Artworks should also be frequently sent to the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers for exhibition, and worker-peasant-soldier masses should also be actively organized to observe in urban exhibitions. The tutoring of mass art activities should break the past method of a few people focusing on key points. All art workers should tutor mass art, and one unit should contract to tutor an area or a group of factories, mines, and rural areas, and become relatives with workers and peasants.
　　Strengthen regular socialist ideological education. All state-run art groups and folk professional troupes should allocate stronger political cadres to strengthen the regular political and ideological work of art groups. According to the regulations of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, systematic socialist education should be carried out for all art workers. Studying Chairman Mao's works (especially those on culture and art) should be placed in the first place. They should be regularly informed of current affairs and policies, so that everyone pays attention to the international and domestic situation, and links their professional work with the country's political tasks, so as to improve cadres' thinking and enhance the combat role of art work.
　　Through their own professional practice, meticulously and deeply solve artistic ideological problems. Clearing bourgeois artistic thought in the art team is a relatively weak link in our ideological transformation and ideological liberation, and it is also a relatively complex and difficult to solve link. As long as we can use the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao as a guide, truly achieve politics in command, use the virtual to lead the real, and clearly and firmly implement the policy of art serving politics and serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and at the same time, in regular professional practice, when encountering artistic ideological problems, we can also link them to the fundamental policy for debate, bourgeois artistic thought can still be gradually eliminated.
　　Under the concrete leadership of the Party Central Committee's literary and artistic policy and the Party committees at all levels, coupled with the continuous improvement of the art workers' consciousness of self-transformation, I believe that this art team will be thoroughly transformed within ten years or less, most of the bourgeois thoughts will be eliminated, and most of the art workers will be able to become both red and expert workers class intellectuals.
　　The efforts of ten years, the efforts of 200,000 professional art teams, and the creativity of 600 million people will make great changes in the face of China's art industry. It is difficult to predict now, but we can imagine that most of the art team will have achieved both red and expert, and be proficient in one major and good at many after ten years; they are all familiar with the domestic and international situation and can deeply understand the Party and government's major policies; art workers' participation in industrial and agricultural production labor has formed a system, and everyone understands several production knowledge and has labor experience; everyone has made bosom friends with the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, and many worker-peasant-soldier artists have poured into professional art teams; everyone has a Marxist-Leninist foundation and understands how to use dialectical materialism, and has a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic theories, and the spirit of serving workers, peasants and soldiers has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has become a guide for the vast number of art cadres to consciously abide by in practice; most art workers have achieved proficiency in one major and good at many or proficiency in a few and good at many, and are proficient and knowledgeable; art workers are able to explore all potential to serve socialism and play a great role in promoting construction.
　　Ten years later, the dross of China's national opera art will be basically eliminated, and the essence will be greatly promoted. The style of many advanced figures in history will be further expressed and praised by people. All art forms are competing to be beautiful and bloom in expressing realistic themes. The heroic figures of the new era are vividly expressed. Opera performance skills have been greatly innovated, clichés have been swept away, and wonderful poems and new tunes are changing with each passing day. A large number of new operas have been produced, creating a unique style in performance style. Many musical and dance forms that have been moved from foreign countries have been basically nationalized and popularized. Many soloists are singing long new balladry and solo songs of new operas. Choirs using the European singing method are singing opera choruses and balladry choruses. All kinds of art works can create a unique style and are colorful. Chinese painters have found a way to express new life. The new people and new things in the socialist motherland, the increasingly beautiful natural scenery after labor transformation, etc., are artistically reproduced under the wonderful brush of Chinese painters, making people pleasing to the eye and beautiful.
　　Art has been greatly popularized among the masses. Not only can everyone among the workers, peasants and soldiers of all ethnic groups write, paint, compose, direct, sing, and dance, but also the level of amateur artists among many workers, peasants and soldiers has approached professional cadres, and many people have already surpassed them. At the same time, in each art department, there is a group of representative art groups and famous artists with high ideological and artistic levels that play a backbone role and demonstration role in the entire art industry, standing out on the world stage and art scene, and shining brightly.
　　The Chinese people's heroic and extraordinary historical facts of struggle, the soaring spirit of communist builders, and the incomparably intelligent creative spirit, the constantly developing new life of the people, etc., must be expressed in art. I firmly believe that more than 600 million people (including 200,000 art workers) will also create miracles in the prosperity, development, and improvement of art, write the newest and most beautiful words, and paint the newest and most beautiful pictures! Art, one of the forms of the great communist spiritual culture of the Chinese working people, will emit a brilliant light. The prosperous and powerful socialist China—a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture—will be bathed in dazzling brilliance and stand in the world with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

　　艺术工作中的破和立
　　周巍峙
    再其次，要在伟大的文化革命与技术革命中坚决贯彻两条道路和两条路线的斗争，彻底打破对于技术的迷信，打破完全依靠少数资产阶级艺术家或名艺人发展艺术事业的右倾保守思想。艺术各部门的技术，也是人类劳动经验的积累，长期精神劳动的成果。技术在不断的艺术实践中，在表达多种多样的内容中，特别在表现一个时代的新生活中不断丰富起来，因此技术成长也是人类集体创造的财富，个人技术高低则是由于接受了前辈的遗产，老师的教导，集体的影响，加上个人勤学苦练而得来的，不是什么某个“天才”艺术家“天生”的才能。广大的工农群众在技术上并没有经过严格的训练，进行艺术实践的机会也不多，但由于在人民当中有着丰富的艺术遗产，富有表现生活的才能，因此，在艺术上就能表现出惊人的创造力，并具有一定的表现技巧。中国十几万人的戏曲、曲艺队伍的成长也充分说明广大艺人在没有足够的老师教养的条件下，为了生活，如何自发地进行巨大规模学习戏曲、曲艺，努力掌握技术能力的斗争。
    不走群众路线，仅仅依赖少数专家或名艺人办艺术事业的保守观念是和过分迷信技术的思想联系着的。
    有些资产阶级艺术家和名艺人有较高的业务水平，技术能力，我们应当尊重他们，充分发挥他们的潜力为工农兵服务，并让他们负责培养青年干部。因此过去我们强调青年向他们学习还是对的，问题是我们没有贯彻群众路线，叫青年在学习中敢于提出问题，反对这些专家在教学当中脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的思想和不肯进行技术革新的保守思想，而是让少数资产阶级专家传播了技术的神秘观点，保守思想，技术至上主义，肆无忌惮地扩张它的阵地。名艺人更值得尊重，因为他们是民族艺术的继承者和传播者，同时也是发扬者，轻视他们，对发展民族艺术是有害的，但是否只依靠他们，而不依靠广大艺术队伍就能贯彻执行百花齐放、推陈出新的方针呢？这里使我想到一个问题，广大艺人解放前在政治地位、社会生活、经济生活上受压迫、受歧视；另外在当时许多名角“唯我独尊”的剧团中，普通演员的创造性也受到很大的束缚与压抑。现在情况已有改变，不少戏曲团体艺术创造较活跃，主要就是由于领导、主演和普通演员三者结合，充分发挥集体精神的结果。艺术神秘化的观点，把艺术看成奇货可居是资产阶级艺术思想的特点。迷信技术、迷信少数人则是艺术停滞不前的思想障碍。过去我们仅仅依靠少数专家，结果欧洲艺术形式民族化、群众化的工作迟迟不得开展，民族艺术的提高工作也在少数人当中打圈子，成绩也不够大，假使我们能打破迷信观点，发动十几万艺人和青年艺术工作者都进行技术革新工作，我看那股劲头一定十分惊人，民族艺术的革新和提高以及新文艺的民族化、群众化的过程一定加速发展。多快好省地发展艺术事业，实现艺术的大普及，并在普及的基础上不断提高，逐步做到“大提高”的伟大任务绝不是只靠少数人所能完成的。今后，我们一方面仍要青年艺术工作者向专家、名艺人学习业务，提高自己的技术能力，但我们在思想上应更注意发挥广大青年艺术工作者和广大艺人的积极性和创造精神，使更多人想出更多的办法来掌握技术，提高业务能力，创造社会主义艺术。青年们富有朝气与进取精神，只要好好指导他们提高政治思想觉悟，注意红与专的结合，我们就可以放手让他们去掌握技术，革新技术，发展技术。现在有许多青年作家、青年演员和歌唱家能够“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。只要把技术的革新和政治任务结合，形成群众运动，而不是只谈业务，不谈政治，关门培养少数人的话，我相信绝不会发展技术至上主义和名利思想，如有发现也好克服。
    在专业艺术队伍当中要走群众路线，对工农兵群众业余的艺术活动更应贯彻群众路线了。目前群众艺术大跃进，就充分说明了这一点。生产资料所有制改变了，群众的思想解放了，生产力提高了，他们用自己的劳动革“穷”的命，也用自己的劳动革“白”的命。他们的创作劲头特别大，创造才能惊人。过去我对如何创造社会主义的民族的新艺术的问题，也有一种神秘化的观点，似乎只有少数名作家、名画家、名艺术家和某些业务水平较高的艺术团体才有创造的条件，根本没有想到普及与提高相结合的过程也就是社会主义的民族的新艺术不断创造和不断发展的过程，更没有想到革命艺术的大普及，广泛群众性的艺术活动的大开展，才是创造与发展社会主义的民族的新艺术的最巩固的基础。我们要用群众艺术的风格改造专家的风格，用群众的创造来推进专业艺术水平的提高。我们要用工农群众艺术家和青年专业艺术工作者的创造成果来教育和改造资产阶级艺术家。我想只要工农艺术家不断出现，又红又专的青年艺术家很快成长起来了，那些不想改造的资产阶级艺术家在这种逼人的形势下面，思想再不改造，艺术风格再不转变也就不行了。
    关于资产阶级艺术家和广大艺术队伍的思想改造问题，具体措施方面，初步想到有下列几点：
    深入实际斗争、深入工农群众是艺术队伍思想改造最重要、最根本的办法。剧作家、作曲家、画家应该经常在下面。其他艺术表演人员、研究人员也应在一定时期内脱离现任工作，打破知识分子的小圈子，分散到工农群众的大海里，以体力劳动为主，兼作基层文化工作，或者以基层文化工作为主，同时参加体力劳动，这是改造思想比较容易见效的办法。某些离职劳动尚有困难的人，可采取定期参加义务劳动和在巡回演出中、辅导群众文艺活动中参加体力劳动的办法。办法可以多种多样的，但是目的都是在工农兵群众中改造自己，在劳动中改造自己。
    把直接为工农兵的创作和演出放在首要地位。送上门去，直接为工农兵演出，每年至少应占三、四个月的时间，有的剧团大部分时间在农村、工厂中演出。在剧场演出中，还应有计划的组织工农兵观众，并为他们看戏创造便利条件。美术作品也应经常送到工农兵群众中去展览，在城市中展览也应积极组织工农兵群众来观摩。对群众艺术活动的辅导，应该突破过去少数人搞重点的办法，所有艺术工作者都要辅导群众艺术，一个单位包干辅导一个地区或一批厂矿、农村，和工农群众攀亲家。
    加强经常的社会主义思想教育。所有国营艺术团体和民间职业剧团都要调配较强的政治干部，以加强艺术团体经常的政治思想工作。按照中央宣传部规定，对全体艺术工作者进行社会主义的系统教育。学习毛主席的著作（特别是关于文化艺术方面的著作）应放在首要地位。要经常向他们报告时事政策，使大家注意国际和国内的形势，并把自己的业务和国家的政治任务联系起来，以提高干部思想和提高艺术工作的战斗作用。
    通过本身的业务实践，细致地、深入地解决艺术思想问题。在艺术队伍中清除资产阶级艺术思想，是我们改造思想、解放思想中比较薄弱的一环，也是比较复杂不易解决的一环。只要我们能以党和毛主席的指示作指针，真正做到政治挂帅，以虚带实，明确地、坚定地贯彻艺术为政治服务，为工农兵服务的方针，同时在经常的业务实践中，遇到艺术思想问题，又能联系根本方针予以辩论，资产阶级艺术思想还是可以逐步清除的。
    在党中央文艺方针和各级党委的具体领导下，加上艺术工作者进行自我改造的自觉性不断提高，我相信在十年或不到十年的时间内这支艺术队伍，一定能得到彻底的改造，资产阶级思想大部得到清除，多数的艺术工作者都能成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    十年的时间、二十万人的专业艺术队伍的努力、六亿人口的创造力，将使中国艺术事业的面貌发生多大的变化现在很难预料，但我们可以设想十年后艺术队伍的大多数人一定已做到又红又专，一专多用；他们都很熟悉国内外局势，能深刻理解党和政府重大方针政策；艺术工作者参加工农业生产劳动已形成一套制度，每人都懂得几门生产知识，并且有了劳动经验；大家都和工农兵群众交上了知心朋友，而且有很多工农兵艺术家涌入专业艺术队伍；大家都具有马克思列宁主义基础，懂得运用辩证唯物论，对毛主席的文艺理论都已有较深的理解，为工农兵服务的精神，已深入人心，变成广大艺术干部在实践中自觉遵守的指针；多数艺术工作者已做到一专多能或少专多能，而且专得深，懂得宽；艺术工作者能够发掘一切潜力，为社会主义服务，对建设事业发挥很大的推动作用。
    十年后中国的民族戏曲艺术的糟粕基本清除，精华大大发扬，历史上许多先进人物的风采有了进一步的表现，得到人们的赞美。所有艺术形式都在表现现实题材上争艳斗妍，万花齐放。新时代的英雄人物得到生动的表现。戏曲表演技巧大大革新，陈词滥调一扫而光，妙诗新腔日新月异。新歌剧大量产生，在演出风格上独创一格。许多从外国移来的音乐舞蹈形式已基本上民族化、群众化，许多独唱家在唱长篇新曲艺和新戏曲的独唱曲，欧洲唱法的合唱团大唱戏曲合唱和曲艺合唱。各类美术作品都能独创一格、万紫千红。国画家在表现新生活方面已摸出了一条道路，社会主义祖国的新人新事，经过劳动改造越加美丽的自然景色等等，都在国画家的妙笔下得到艺术的再现，使人赏心悦目，美不胜收。
    艺术在群众中大大普及，在各民族工农群众当中不但做到人人能写、能画、能编、能导、能唱、能舞，而且在许多工农群众中的业余艺术家的水平都已接近专业干部，不少人早已超过。同时每一艺术部门都有一批富有代表性的，思想水平与艺术水平较高的艺术团体和著名的艺术家在整个艺术事业中起骨干作用，示范作用，在世界舞台上、画坛上独树一帜，大放异采。
    中国人民英勇卓绝的斗争史实，共产主义建设者的冲天气概和聪明无比的创造精神，不断向前发展的人民的新的生活面貌等等，在艺术上非表现不可，我坚决相信六亿多人民（包括二十万艺术工作者在内），一定也会在艺术的繁荣、发展、提高方面创造出奇迹，写出最新最美的文字，画出最新最美的画图来！中国劳动人民的伟大的共产主义精神文化集中表现的形式之一——艺术，将发出万分灿烂的光辉，繁荣、富强的社会主义的中国——一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，将满身浴着耀眼的光彩，和苏联及其他社会主义国家在一起，矗立在世界上。  （续完）
