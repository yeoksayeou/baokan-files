Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Baghdad dispatch from TASS: On the afternoon of August 7th, democratic forces in the Iraqi capital organized a grand demonstration. More than 150,000 people participated in the march. Their slogans were: "Long Live the Hope of the People - Peace!" "Long Live the Free and Democratic Republic of Iraq!" "Long Live the Unity of Arabs and Kurds!" "Long Live Iraqi-Soviet Friendship!".

The marchers went to the Ministry of Defense building and held a mass rally. Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qasim delivered a congratulatory speech to the masses at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 7th: According to a report in today's "Red Right Newspaper," Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qasim said in an interview with Czechoslovak journalists that Iraqi foreign policy is based on the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and is centered on the idea of active neutrality. He said that our policy is first to carry out close cooperation with Arab countries, and as for the union with the United Arab Republic, whether it takes the form of a federation or other forms, that can only be decided by the will of the people.

Qasim said that the Iraqi people were able to carry out the revolution at such a fast speed and with such firm determination, and they will be able to defend themselves with equal determination. He said: We have signed a joint defense agreement with the United Arab Republic, we are members of the United Nations, and world opinion is on our side.

Qasim expressed his deep gratitude to the socialist countries for recognizing the Iraqi Republic when it was in a critical and difficult situation. He said: We will never forget this, so our friendship will last forever.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Manila: According to today's "Manila Chronicle," Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Arif demanded that American and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. He said that the presence of foreign troops endangers peace in the Middle East.

According to a report from the newspaper's Baghdad correspondent, Arif said that the two Western countries have already violated their stated purpose of sending these troops to "protect the Middle East from aggression." He said that the people of the Middle East know better how to defend their own countries.

    巴格达十五万人大示威
    卡塞姆说外交政策以万隆原则为根据
    新华社8日讯  塔斯社巴格达讯：7日下午伊拉克首都的民主力量在这里组织了盛大的示威游行。有十五万多人参加游行。他们的口号是：“人民的希望——和平万岁！”“自由民主的伊拉克共和国万岁！”“阿拉伯人和库尔德人的团结万岁！”“伊拉克—苏联友好万岁！”。
    游行的人走到国防部大楼，举行了群众大会。伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在大会上向群众致祝贺词。
    新华社布拉格7日电  据“红色权利报”今天报道，伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在接见捷克斯洛伐克记者时说，伊拉克外交政策是以万隆会议的决议为基础，并且是以积极中立的思想作为轴心的。他说，我们的方针首先是同阿拉伯国家进行密切的合作，至于同阿拉伯联合共和国的联合是采取联邦的形式或者其他形式，那只能由人民的意志决定。
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克人民能够以那么快的速度和那样坚决的决心来进行革命，也就能够同样地坚决保卫自己。他说：我们同阿拉伯联合共和国签订有共同防御协定，我们是联合国的成员，世界的舆论站在我们这一方面。
    卡塞姆对于社会主义国家在伊拉克共和国处在危急和困难的时候就承认了它这件事表示深深的感谢。他说：我们将永远不会忘记这件事，因此我们的友谊将永远存在的。
    据新华社8日讯  马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”今天报道，伊拉克副总理阿里夫要求美国和英国军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤走。他说，外国军队的存在使中东和平受到危险。
    据这家报纸驻巴格达记者报道，阿里夫说，这两个西方国家已经违背了它们宣称派遣这些军队以“保护中东不受侵略”的目的。他说，中东人民更加知道如何保卫他们自己的国家。
