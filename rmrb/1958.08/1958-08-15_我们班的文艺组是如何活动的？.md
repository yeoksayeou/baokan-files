　　How Our Class's Literary and Art Group Operates
　　Tian Xiuzhen, Worker of Fine Yarn Group B, Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Mill
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, our class's trade union propaganda work is completed by organizing fellow workers through various forms. The literary and art group is an important component of the trade union's propaganda work, bringing rich and colorful content and a lively atmosphere to our propaganda efforts. Through this vivid, infectious, and concise literary and artistic form, we conduct communist ideological education among employees. Here, I will introduce the activities of our literary and art group.
　  Organization and Purpose of the Literary and Art Group's Activities
    Our literary and art group was established in 1953, and currently has nineteen members. Based on their interests, the members are divided into four subgroups: singing, dancing, Pingju opera, and drama. Among these nineteen people, there are six Party members and eleven members of the Communist Youth League. These people are also skilled in production; fourteen of the nineteen are advanced producers. There are conditions for participating in the literary and art propaganda group: each member must be good at production, good at learning, good at literary and artistic activities, and have good moral character. They must all be good workers who can set an example. The Party often teaches us that "educators must first be educated." The literary and art group must also first be educated; without being able to set an example and lacking prestige among the masses, it cannot play the role of educating the masses. Each member of the literary and art group has a clear purpose in participating in literary and artistic activities. Their slogan is "Come early and leave late for propaganda."
    In early April 1956, we participated in the factory's performance with three programs, all of which we wrote ourselves. Among them, the comedic skit "Little Dwarfs" was based on the advanced experience of Chen Jinrong's knot-free yarn joining technique, which was being promoted in our workshop at the time. Some people were not doing it well and were not learning. Why are people short? It's because they're not open to learning. This skit was very funny, and we performed it in the workshop. This was the literary and art group's first service to the workshop's production. The response after the performance was very good and was well-received by the workers, playing a significant role in promoting the learning of advanced experience. "Don't be a little dwarf" temporarily became a catchphrase for workers to encourage each other in learning advanced experience. After that performance, our literary and art group held a meeting, and the Party branch also sent someone to participate. After discussion, we clarified several issues: the activity base of the class's literary and art group should mainly be in the workshop, and the target audience should mainly be the workers in our workshop, so that the workshop's literary and art group can be active regularly. At the same time, through the role of promoting production generated by this performance, we clarified that the content of the workshop's literary and art activities must be based on self-creation and self-performance, combined with the real people and events of the employees, to educate the masses and educate ourselves. For more than two years, following this direction, we have performed more than eighty programs, effectively coordinating with production and various central movements. This March, we performed nine programs, all of which were coordinated with the Double-Anti movement and production. Because these programs are all from the actual situation in the workshop, the performance effect is also significant. For example, in the early stage of the Double-Anti movement, everyone didn't know what the "five airs" were. Although the workshop had made a report, some people were still not clear. Based on this situation, the literary and art group performed a "living cartoon" called "What are the Five Airs" before a Double-Anti meeting. Everyone watched, laughed, and understood the spirit. When they discussed in the group meeting, they all used the people in the play as analogies. In short, we believe that workshop literature and art is an important weapon for conducting ideological education among employees and is an important component of propaganda work.
　  Methods of Activity
    1. Source of Materials: To create materials ourselves and coordinate with the movement in a timely manner, we must understand the thoughts of the employees and grasp the spirit of the movement and the Party's policies. There are three main sources. One source is from the leadership. Every month, the Party branch secretary talks about the ideological situation according to the progress of the movement, and the requirements of the trade union's propaganda work every month are the guidelines that our literary and art group follows. Another source is from the literary and art group itself. The members of the literary and art group are distributed in various groups and are cells of the workshop as a whole. They are actors and workers who live among the masses and know everyone's thoughts and problems. The literary and art group has a system of meeting once every three days to report on the performance effects and reflect on existing problems, and then raise new problems. For example, at the beginning of the Double-Anti movement, everyone was afraid to give opinions to their group. After understanding this thought, we performed "Boldly Give Opinions." Later, everyone spoke more actively.
    2. Writing, Rehearsing, and Performing: Once we have the content, we think about what form of expression is suitable, how many characters to use, and then everyone goes back to write the script. Then we meet again, rehearse, and memorize the lines. What costumes to use and how to make up are all figured out. For example, in the play "Double Competition," we wanted to use a comparative form to express advanced and backward states to better promote workers' understanding of production. One side was competing in enthusiasm, and the other was competing in food and clothing. We had seen the play "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" in the past, which gave us great inspiration. We used a partition to divide a stage into two rooms, so that we could express a larger content in a one-act form. Some content is suitable for double acts, and some is suitable for crosstalk, so we determine the form based on the content. Generally, we rehearse during the time before and after the shift. When the task is tight, we use meal times. The roles are assigned based on the characteristics and personality of the characters in the play, and are determined by everyone through discussion. Sometimes, for the things that some roles need to express, the actors are not familiar with them or are relatively unfamiliar, so we invite people outside the literary and art group who are familiar with these situations to participate in the performance. The workers in the workshop are all reserves for the literary and art group. For example, Xiang Yulan, the leader of the model group, played the role of the advanced worker in "Double Competition." Zhang Huixia, the wage committee member, played the main role in "Wage Reform." Our performance time is before the trade union's activity day meeting. We don't perform without a meeting. Since the establishment of the literary and art group, we have never used public funds. Clothes and rouge are all our own. If we don't have our own, we borrow them. We believe that the workshop's literary and art group cannot be compared with the factory-level literary and art team, because the main task of the workshop's literary and art is to serve the production and ideological education of our workshop.
    3. Internal System: We have three systems in our literary and art group.
    1. Monthly Plan, Weekly Arrangement: Every month, according to the class's propaganda work plan, we formulate the group's work plan. However, the monthly plan generally only has some numbers and determines the general content. It is impossible to be too specific, so there is also a weekly arrangement, which is the action plan, including which programs to rehearse, what content, what form, and who is responsible. Temporary tasks are not included.
    2. Report on Time, Regular Inspection: Within our group, members report to the group leader every three days. The content is to collect feedback on the effects of the previous performance and study and determine the next step in the activity content. This is a method of inspection. We continuously improve our working methods through checking the effects. When we started performing, the content of the plays was all about group meetings. People reflected that we usually have meetings, and we also have meetings in the plays, so we changed to perform content about families. Later, the workers reflected again: the literary and art group always performs family matters. Why don't you change it up? Now our forms are more diverse.
    A comprehensive inspection is done every half month. For example, in March, the quantity was completed well, but the diversity of forms was not completed, so we created a small song and dance drama "Small Defects" and wrote two songs. Through such inspections, we spur ourselves to continuously improve and improve our literary and art propaganda.
    3. Learning and Ideological Education: To ensure that we can produce programs with good ideological content and high quality in a timely manner and give full play to everyone's enthusiasm and initiative, we must continuously improve the ideological and professional level of the literary and art group members and strengthen political and ideological leadership. Our literary and art group has a learning system and regularly studies various political and literary books and periodicals. Some of our programs are adapted from stories in books. For example, "Mother's Tears" is adapted from some real events in "Chinese Women." In addition to this, we must do ideological work anytime and anywhere. Some people in our group have achieved some success in acting and sometimes show arrogance. We promptly find him to talk to, point out his shortcomings, or have everyone criticize him. Therefore, everyone in our literary and art group is full of vigor.
    Two Points of Understanding
    In addition to the above understanding of the principles and activities of workshop literature and art, I will focus on the following two points:
    1. The workshop's literary and art group must be under the constant leadership of the Party and rely on the wisdom and efforts of the masses to operate well. Our workshop's literary and art group has a trade union class chairman, a Party branch propaganda committee member, and the workshop branch secretary sometimes also acts as our director. Any problems can be discovered and resolved at any time. Sometimes they are also actors. For example, the trade union chairman played the role of the "Little Mischief" in "Everything for Zero Distribution." The branch secretary also participated in the rehearsal. At the beginning, the content we created did not express the spirit of the fine yarn workers, and the content was not tortuous enough. The transformation of the backward workers was too sudden. After they made suggestions, we added a plot, and the plot was more complete. On the other hand, we must rely on everyone to do it. The selection of content, the assignment of roles, and the final performance of our programs are all decided by everyone.
    2. Since workshop literature and art is an important part of propaganda work, it must grasp ideology, express the advanced, and conduct education from a positive perspective, just like propaganda work. The form of expression must also be clear, vivid, ideological, and combative.

　　我们班的文艺组是如何活动的？
　　天津棉纺四厂细纱乙班工人　田秀珍
    我们班的工会宣传工作是在党支部的领导下，通过各种形式，组织了工人同志们共同完成的。文艺组是工会宣传工作的重要组成部分，它给我们宣传工作带来了丰富多采的内容和生动活泼的气氛。通过这种形象的、有感染力的、短小精悍的文艺形式，向职工进行共产主义思想教育。我在这里将文艺组的活动情况做个介绍。
　  文艺组的组织情况及活动的目的
    我们的文艺组是在1953年建立起来的，到目前全组有十九人。根据组员爱好又分了歌咏、舞蹈、评剧、话剧四个小组。这十九人中有六个党员，十一个团员。在生产上这些人也都是能手，十九个人中就有十四个先进生产者。参加文艺宣传组的人是有条件的，每个文艺组的成员必须是生产好、学习好、文艺活动好、品德好的，都必须是能够以身作则的好工人。党经常教导我们“教育者必须首先受教育”，文艺组也是必须首先受教育的，不能以身作则，在群众中没有威信，就起不到教育群众的作用。每个文艺组的成员参加文艺活动的目的都是明确的，他们提出的口号是“早来晚走为宣传”。
    1956年4月初参加厂内会演有三个节目，都是我们自己编的，其中小滑稽戏“小矮人”是根据那时我们车间正推广陈金荣接头没疙疸的先进经验，有些人做得不好又不学习的情况编出来的。人为什么矮了呢？就是因为不虚心学习。这个戏很逗哏，我们就把它在车间里演出了。这是文艺组第一次为车间的生产服务。演出后反应挺好，很受工人欢迎，对推动学习先进经验起了很大作用。不做“小矮人”，一时变成工人们在学习先进经验中互相督促和鼓励的口头禅。在那次演出后，我们文艺组召开了一个会，党支部也派人参加了。经过讨论，我们明确了几个问题，就是班文艺组的活动阵地应当主要在车间，服务对象应主要是本车间的工人，这样车间文艺组才能经常活动。同时通过这次演出在生产中产生的促进作用，使我们明确了车间文艺的内容，必须是以自编自演为主，结合职工真人真事，教育群众，教育自己。两年多来，本着这个方向，我们一共演出了八十多个节目，有力地配合了生产及各项中心运动。今年3月份演出了九个，都是配合双反和生产的。由于我们这些节目都是来自车间里的实际，所以演出效果也就显著。如双反运动初期，大伙不知道什么是五气，虽然车间里做了报告，有的人还是不清楚。文艺组根据这个情况，就在一次双反会前演出一出活洋片戏“什么叫五气”。大家看着一边笑一边把精神也领会了。等到小组会上大伙讨论也都拿戏里的人打比方。总之，我们认为车间文艺是向职工进行思想教育的重要武器，是宣传工作的重要组成部分。
　  活动的办法
    一、材料的来源：要自编材料，及时配合运动，就必须了解职工的思想，掌握运动的精神，党的政策。主要来源有三方面。一方面是来自领导。每月党支书根据运动进展讲讲思想情况，每月工会宣传工作要求，是我们文艺组遵循的纲领。另一方面来源就是文艺组大伙凑，文艺组的人分布在各小组，是车间整体的细胞，他们是演员，也是工人，平时生活在群众之中，大伙有什么想法，有什么问题都知道。文艺组有个制度，每三天碰头一次，汇报演出的效果，同时反映现有的问题，再提出新问题来。如双反刚开始时，大家都不敢给本组提意见，了解了这种思想，就演出了“大胆提意见”。后来，大伙发言就积极了。
    二、编、排与演：有了内容，就想用什么形式表达适合，用几个角色，然后大伙回去编词，再一碰，连排带对词，用什么服装，怎样化装就都出来了。如“双比”这个戏，想用对比形式表现先进与落后，更好地促进工人提高对生产的认识，一边要比干劲，一边要比吃穿，过去看过“上海屋檐下”这个剧，给了我们很大的启发，用隔板把一个舞台分成两间屋子，这样就可以把较大的内容用独幕的形式表现出来。有的内容适合双簧，有的适合用相声，就根据内容来确定形式。一般都是用班前班后时间排戏任务紧时就用吃饭的时间。角色分配，都是根据剧中人物的特点与性格由大伙商量确定，有时有的角色要表现的事物，演员们都不熟悉或比较生疏，就邀请文艺组以外的，熟悉这些情况的人参加演出。车间里的工人都是文艺组的后备军。如“双比”里的比先进工人，就是邀请模范小组组长项玉兰担任的。“工资改革”里的主要演员就是由工资委员张慧霞担任。我们演出的时间，都是在工会活动日开会以前，没有会议不演出。文艺组成立后一直没用过公家的钱，衣服、胭脂粉都是自己的，自己没有的就借。我们认为车间文艺组不能与厂级文艺团队比，因为车间文艺的主要任务还是为本车间的生产和思想教育服务。
    三、组内制度：我们文艺组里有三种制度。
    1、月有计划，周有安排：每月根据班里的宣传工作计划，制定组内的工作计划，但月计划一般的只有些数字，确定大体内容，不可能太具体，因此每周还有个安排，也就是行动计划，包括排哪几个节目，什么内容，什么形式，谁负责。临时任务不算在内。
    2、按时汇报，定期检查：我们组内，组员每三天向组长作一次汇报，内容是收集上次演出效果反映，研究确定下步活动内容，这是一种检查方式。我们通过检查效果不断地改进工作方法。开始演时，戏的内容都是小组会，人们反映，平时开会，看戏也开会，我们就换演些内容是关于家庭的。后来工人们又反映：文艺组演戏总是过家子，为什么不变变呢？现在我们的形式就比较多样些了。
    全面检查是半月一次。如3月份在数量上完成得较好，形式多样没有完成，于是我们就编排了一个小歌舞剧“小疵点”，写了两支歌，通过这样的检查，鞭策我们不断地提高和改进文艺宣传。
    3、学习与思想教育：要保证及时排出思想内容好、质量高的节目，发挥大家的积极性、主动性，就必须不断地提高文艺组员思想和业务水平，加强政治思想领导，我们文艺组有学习制度，经常学习各种政治、文艺书刊，我们有些节目就是按书上的故事编下来的，如“母亲的眼泪”就根据“中国妇女”上的一些实事改编的，除此而外还要随时随地的做思想工作，我们组有的人演戏有些成绩，有时表现了骄气，我们就及时地找他谈话，指出缺点或者大伙展开批评，所以我们文艺组每个人都是朝气勃勃的。
    两点体会
    除以上关于车间文艺的方针活动等一些体会外，最后我着重谈谈以下二点：
    一、车间文艺组必须在党的经常领导下，依靠群策群力才能活动得好。我们车间文艺组就有工会班主席，有党支部宣传委员，车间支部书记有时也作我们的导演，有什么问题，可以随时发现和解决。有时候他们也是演员，如“一切为了零分布”里的小挑皮，就是工会主席。支部书记也参加排演。开始我们编的内容，没有把细纱工人的干劲表现出来，同时在内容上也不够曲折，落后工人的转变太突然，经他们提出意见，补充了一个情节，剧情就比较完整了。另一方面就是要依靠大伙来办，我们的节目从内容的选择，角色的分配，最后的演出都是大家来决定的。
    二、车间文艺既然是宣传工作的重要的组成部分，就必须同宣传工作一样要抓思想，表现先进，多从正面进行教育，在表现形式上也要鲜明生动，有思想性、有战斗性。
