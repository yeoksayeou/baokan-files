　　Can Make Phone Calls, Can Listen to the Radio
　　Local Expert Liu Zhenchang Makes a Dual-Purpose Loudspeaker
    (Our report) Liu Zhenchang, a broadcaster and Communist Youth League member from Changfa Township, Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has recently created a dual-purpose loudspeaker that can make phone calls and listen to the radio. Any household with a broadcast loudspeaker can, for only 2 yuan and 37 fen, buy two dry batteries, a microphone, two buttons, and an electric bell, install them on the loudspeaker, and then use the broadcast loudspeaker to make phone calls or participate in telephone conferences. This invention is of great value to promoting the rapid realization of telephone communication in rural areas. To this end, the CPC Hejiang Prefectural Committee held an on-site meeting to promote this invention throughout the region; the Huachuan County Committee of the Communist Youth League also awarded Liu Zhenchang the title of "Outstanding Communist Youth League Member."
    Liu Zhenchang is twenty-three years old this year and has only attended school for five years, but he is very interested in broadcasting. In 1956, he was transferred to Changfa Township to do broadcasting work. During the Great Leap Forward this year, because the villages and hamlets in Changfa Township were scattered and far apart, each cooperative sent people to report the situation to the township every day, which not only wasted manpower but also delayed the reporting. Therefore, the township committee decided to install telephones in each cooperative, but they could not buy telephone sets. This situation prompted Liu Zhenchang to use his brain. After several days of hard thinking, based on the principle that a microphone can transmit sound in a telephone, he discovered that installing a microphone on a loudspeaker could transmit sound. After Secretary Yang of the township Party committee learned of Liu Zhenchang's idea, he encouraged him to be bold and do it. After some painstaking research, he installed two batteries, a microphone, and a button on the broadcast loudspeaker, and the broadcast, which could receive and reply, was finally made; but it still could not send signals to the switchboard. Liu Zhenchang continued his research and installed a button to send signals and an electric bell to receive signals, and the dual-purpose loudspeaker was completely successful. At present, more than twenty units have been installed in Changfa Township. (Illustration attached)

### 能打电话　能听广播　土专家刘振昌制成两用喇叭

　　能打电话　能听广播
　　土专家刘振昌制成两用喇叭
    本报讯　黑龙江省桦川县长发乡广播员、共青团员刘振昌，最近创造了一种能打电话又能听广播的两用喇叭。凡是有广播喇叭的人家，只要花两元三角七分钱，买上两节干电池、一个送话器、两个电钮、一个电铃，安在喇叭上，就能利用广播喇叭打电话或参加电话会议。这项创造对于促进农村迅速实现电话化有很大价值。为此，中共合江地委召开了现场会议，在全区推广这项创造；共青团桦川县委会还授予刘振昌“优秀共青团员”称号。
    刘振昌今年二十三岁，只读过五年书，对广播工作很感兴趣。1956年他调到长发乡做广播工作。今年生产大跃进中，因为长发乡村屯分散，距离较远，各社每天派人向乡汇报情况，不仅浪费人工，而且汇报不及时，因此乡委决定在各社安上电话，但是买不到电话机。这种情况促使刘振昌开动了脑筋。经过几天苦思苦想，他根据送话器能在电话机里送话的道理，发现了把送话器安到喇叭上可以送话的线索。乡党委杨书记知道刘振昌的想法以后，勉励他大胆干。经过他一番苦心钻研，他在广播喇叭上安上两节电池、一个送话器、一个电钮，能收听、能回话的广播总算制出来了；但是它还不能向交换台要信号，刘振昌继续研究，安上了一个要信号的电钮和一个受信号的电铃，两用喇叭便完全成功了。目前，长发乡已安装了二十多台。（附图片）
