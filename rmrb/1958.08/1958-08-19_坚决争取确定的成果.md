　　Resolutely Strive for Definite Results
　　Ding Shan
　　The tool reform movement in Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, is booming and progressing rapidly. In twelve days, 200,000 ball bearings of various specifications were produced, and 95% of the county's nine types of rotating tools were equipped with ball bearings. However, the situation in Xingping County is completely different. Tool reform in this county has not yet formed a movement and appears bleak. In fourteen days, only over 20,000 ball bearings were produced, and most have not been installed. This is a sharp contrast.
　　Why is the tool reform movement in Xianyang County progressing so quickly and so well? The important reason lies in the determination of the leadership. After the provincial party committee held a telephone conference to deploy the task of installing ball bearings on all rotating tools, the county party committee held a meeting overnight to study methods for achieving the task ahead of schedule, put forward the call of "Big waves in three days, see the results in four days," and made it known to every household in the shortest possible time. "Big waves in three days, see the results in four days" is a loud slogan, full of vigor. This slogan fully demonstrates the leadership's unwavering determination to achieve the task of bearingizing rotating tools ahead of schedule, and also points out clear goals and specific requirements to the masses, thus playing a huge role in accelerating the tool reform movement.
　　How to turn this slogan into reality? They did not send a large number of people to other places to purchase ball bearings, nor did they rely on a few skilled craftsmen to manufacture them. They resolutely relied on the broad masses, followed the mass line, gave play to the wisdom and talent of the broad masses, and mobilized the infinite power of the broad masses. The slogan put forward by the county party committee was: "Everyone learns technology, every commune sets up a factory, every factory makes models, and finds tools themselves." This slogan generated tremendous power. Men, women, old and young, and all craftsmen in the county participated in the ball bearing manufacturing movement. All walks of life also supported the movement in all aspects. Many housesides, roadsides, and under trees became construction sites for manufacturing ball bearings. Many people donated the scrap steel and rotten iron in their homes as raw materials, which formed a massive national movement.
　　Now, there are many tasks in various localities. The leading comrades in some places often cannot achieve definite results in all tasks because there are too many tasks. Some work has not formed a mass movement, or the movement is abandoned halfway, starting strong but finishing weak. This situation must be resolutely changed. The way to change it is to be like the comrades in Xianyang, setting time limits, setting targets, setting working methods, concentrating efforts to complete the task with a crash program, and be determined to strive for a complete victory, and never stop until the goal is achieved. We opposed fighting alone in the past, but in practice, there must be a clear center and a firm plan within a certain period of time, otherwise nothing will be accomplished. Several tasks can be carried out in combination, but it must be determined which one or two tasks are the top priority. Don't do a little bit of everything, and don't strive for complete victory in anything; or every task can be done more or less, can be done well, or can be done poorly. Xingping County and other regions can pay good attention to this issue.

　　坚决争取确定的成果
　　丁山
    陕西咸阳县的工具改革运动搞得轰轰烈烈，进展飞速，在十二天中造出各种规格的滚珠二十万颗，把全县九种运转工具的95％都安上了滚珠轴承。但是兴平县的情况却完全不同，工具改革在这个县还没有形成运动，显得冷冷清清，在十四天中只造出二万多颗滚珠，一般都没有安装上。这是一个尖锐的对照。
    为什么咸阳县的工具改革运动能够搞得这样快，这样好呢？重要的原因在于领导上有决心。当省委召开电话会议，布置把一切运转工具都安上滚珠轴承的任务之后，县委连夜开会，研究了提前实现任务的办法，提出了“三天见大浪，四天看高低”的号召，并且在最短时间内做到家喻户晓。“三天见大浪，四天看高低”这是一个响亮的口号，十分有气魄。这个口号充分表现出领导上对提前实现运转工具轴承化的任务有坚定不移的决心，同时也向群众指出了明确的奋斗目标和具体要求，因而对加速工具改革运动起了巨大的推动作用。
    怎样使这个口号变成现实呢？他们不是派大批人员到外地去采购滚珠轴承，不是依靠少数能工巧匠来制造。他们坚决依靠广大群众，走群众路线，发挥广大群众的聪明才智，动员广大群众的无穷力量。县委提出的口号是：“人人学技术，社社设工厂，厂厂造模型，自己找工具”。这个口号发生了巨大的力量，全县男女老幼和一切工匠都参加了制造滚珠轴承运动，各行各业也都从各方面来支援这个运动，许多宅旁、路边、树下变成了制造滚珠轴承的工地，许多人把自己家中的废钢烂铁捐献出来作原料，这就形成了一个声势浩大的全民性的运动。
    现在地方上任务非常多，有一些地方的领导同志们往往因为任务太多而不能使各项任务都取得确定的结果。有些工作没有形成群众运动，或者运动半途而废，虎头蛇尾。这种情形必须坚决改变。改变的办法，就是要像咸阳的同志们一样，定出时间，定出指标，定出工作办法，集中力量突击完成，下决心争取全胜，不达目的决不终止。我们反对过单打一，但实际上工作起来，在一定的时间内必须要有明确的中心，坚定的计划，否则会一事无成。几项任务可以结合进行，但必须确定某一二项是第一位的任务。不要什么也干了一点，什么也不争取全胜；或者是每项工作都可以多做，可以少做，可以做好，可以做不好。兴平县和别的地区都可以好好注意到这一问题。
