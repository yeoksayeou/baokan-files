Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 26th: The evening newspaper "Al-Nida" published an editorial on the 25th stating: "The United Nations must recognize People's China as a major power and expel the Taiwan clique from the United Nations, because the Taiwan clique is a gang subservient to the United States and other imperialist countries."

The newspaper said that ignoring the existence of People's China, which has a population of over 600 million, and insisting on recognizing the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan "is illogical." The newspaper pointed out, "This situation has aroused the indignation of millions of people around the world and the Chinese people, because the Chinese people love peace, love freedom, and have made contributions to mankind."

The newspaper also condemned the policy of using Taiwan as a base to threaten mainland China.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 26th: "Al-Shaab" published an editorial on the 25th, pointing out that the United States should be held responsible for the current tense situation in the Far East.

The newspaper said, "Due to the unreasonable attitude of the United States towards the People's Republic of China, the shadow of war is looming there (in the Far East) again." The newspaper pointed out that the United States "disregards the existence of a country with 650 million people (accounting for nearly a quarter of the world's population), which is completely contrary to common sense and will inevitably cause many problems." The newspaper pointed out the tremendous progress China has made since liberation, which makes it a top priority in international affairs.

The newspaper warned that things would not return to normal if People's China did not regain its legitimate status, which had been "usurped by a gang of bandits calling themselves a government."

The newspaper said: "It is beneficial to all parties concerned to recognize this fact today, and do not wait until tomorrow or the day after when the United States is forced to recognize this fact."

According to Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: According to TASS, Tokyo, August 26th: The escalation of the situation in the Far East due to the provocative activities of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan has aroused uneasiness in Japanese public opinion.

People in Tokyo are watching with concern the suspicious "exercises" conducted by the US Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait and the statement by the commander of the US Navy in Japan that the warships and Marines under his command have entered combat readiness. At the same time, according to Japanese newspapers, US Secretary of the Army Bruck arrived in Tokyo today and will also visit South Korea and Taiwan. There are also reports in the newspapers that Admiral Felt, Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Armed Forces, has also arrived in Tokyo.

Progressive Japanese public opinion believes that all these are new provocations by the United States, the purpose of which is to create a new crisis similar to the Middle East crisis.

　　远东紧张局势要由美国负责
    亚非舆论斥美国利用台湾威胁我国安全
    新华社大马士革26日电　晚报“呼声报”25日发表社论说：“联合国必须承认人民中国为一个大国，并且把台湾集团赶出联合国，因为台湾集团是屈从于美国和其他帝国主义国家的匪帮。”
    这家报纸说，无视拥有六亿多人口的人民中国的存在，而坚持承认台湾蒋介石集团，“是不合逻辑的”。这家报纸指出，“这种情况引起全世界千百万人民以及中国人民的愤慨，因为中国人民热爱和平、热爱自由并且为人类作出了贡献。”
    这家报纸还谴责了利用台湾作为威胁中国大陆的基地的政策。
    新华社开罗26日电　“人民报”25日发表社论指出，目前远东的紧张局势应该由美国负责。
    这家报纸说，“由于美国对中华人民共和国采取了无理的态度，战争魔影又在那里（远东）隐隐地出现了”。报纸指出，美国“无视一个有着六亿五千万（几占全世界人口四分之一）人口的国家的存在，这是完全违反常理的，并且一定会引起许多问题”。这家报纸指出了中国在解放后取得的巨大进展，这使它在国际事务中有头等重要的地位。
    报纸警告说，如果人民中国不恢复它被“一帮自称为政府的匪徒篡夺的”合法地位，事情就不会恢复正常。
    这家报纸说：“今天承认这个事实，对所有有关方面都是有利的，不要等待到明天或后天美国被迫承认这个事实的时候。”
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社东京26日讯：由于美国和台湾蒋介石集团对中华人民共和国的挑衅活动而产生的远东局势的尖锐化，引起了日本舆论的不安。
    东京的人士怀着不安的心情注视着美国第七舰队在台湾海峡进行的令人怀疑的“演习”以及美国驻日本的海军司令声明说他所统率的军舰和海军陆战队已经进入战斗准备。同时，据日本报刊报道，美国陆军部长布鲁克今天抵达东京，他还要访问南朝鲜和台湾。报上还有美国太平洋武装部队总司令费尔特海军上将也到达东京的消息。
    日本的进步舆论认为，所有这些都是美国新的挑衅，其目的是想造成类似中东危机的新危机。
