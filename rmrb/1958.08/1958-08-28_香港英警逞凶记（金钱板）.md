A case of violence, happening in broad daylight,
Freedom unprotected, human rights devastated!
Where did this happen? Let me tell you all about it.
It happened on August 26th,
More than a dozen police cars drove to the front of Chung Wah Middle School.
Over two hundred burly men jumped out of the cars,
Each one fully equipped with guns and ammunition.
Heavily guarded as if preparing for a major battle,
The school building was under strict surveillance, front, back, left, and right.
British police rushed into the school gate and called for the principal,
Forcing the school to move immediately!
Saying the school building was too "dangerous,"
They had to leave within half an hour without delay.
Principal Huang argued reasonably and negotiated,
But the British dogs, at a loss for words, resorted to brute force.
They locked Principal Huang and the teachers in a small room,
Not allowing them to speak with the students.
They thought everyone would comply with their armed threats,
Who knew that things would turn out differently!
The students said: We are studying hard,
Why do we have to move for no reason?
The British police, enraged out of shame, became reckless,
Kicking and punching, they tried to drive the teachers and students outside.
They did not allow Xinhua News Agency reporters to take photos,
Afraid that their shameless atrocities would be known to the world.
The presence of reporters from various newspapers frightened the culprits,
Trying to cover up their crimes, they resorted to violence,
Caring nothing for freedom of the press,
Trusting in force, they disregarded the violation of human rights.
The reporters were beaten one by one,
Each one driven out of the school gate.
Then came a burst of batons and fists,
The teachers and students were driven out of their beloved rooms!
Such atrocities are rare,
Truly lawless and outrageous:
This is a challenge to the entire Chinese people,
This is a destruction of human rights!
The Chinese people are extremely angry about this,
The British government must compensate, apologize, and punish the evildoers,
If they do not do so,
They will bear all the consequences!
Truly: After singing this section of the British police's violence,
It makes one's heart burn with anger!

　　香港英警逞凶记（金钱板）
　　易和元
　　一桩行凶案，出在大白天，
　　自由无保障，人权受摧残！
　　此事出何处？听我说一番。
　　话说八月二十六日那一天，
　　十多部警车开到了中华中学大门前。
　　从车上跳下二百多彪形大汉，
　　一个个枪支弹药装备全。
　　严密布防好像是要打大战，
　　校舍前后左右都戒严。
　　英国警察冲进校门就把校长喊，
　　强迫学校马上就得把家搬！
　　说什么校舍建筑太“危险”，
　　半小时内要离开不得迟延。
　　黄校长据理直争把交涉办，
　　英国狗理屈词穷他就动了蛮。
　　把黄校长和教师关在小房里面，
　　不许他们和学生把话来谈。
　　武力威胁他以为大家会照办，
　　谁知道“电灯点火”才不然！
　　学生们说：我们好好在把书来念，
　　为什么平白无故要把啥家搬？
　　英国警察老羞成怒他就蛮干，
　　拳打脚踢要把师生们赶到外边。
　　他不准新华社记者拍照片，
　　怕的是无耻暴行天下传。
　　各报记者在场使凶手心惊胆战，
　　要想遮盖罪行他就动了拳，
　　什么新闻自由他全不管，
　　迷信武力他不顾侵犯人权。
　　记者们一个个都遭殴打，
　　一个个被赶出了校门外边。
　　随后是一阵警棍加拳脚，
　　师生们被赶出了心爱的房间！
　　这样的暴行真少见，
　　真正是无法又无天：
　　这是向全中国人民来挑战，
　　这是在把人权来摧残！
　　中国人民对这事愤怒万端，
　　英国政府必须赔偿道歉惩凶顽，
　　假如他不这样办，
　　一切后果他承担！
　　正是：唱完英警行凶书一段，
　　直叫人怒火燃烧在心间！
