Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Our Foreign Ministry today sent a note to the British Representative Office lodging a strong protest with the British government regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of the Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School and the Hong Kong police's brutal beating of the school's faculty, staff, students, and Chinese journalists who were present to cover the event. The note reads as follows:

　　On the morning of August 26, 1958, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of armed police, using the pretext of so-called "dangerous buildings," and forcibly closed the Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School, and condoned the armed police's brutal beating of the school's faculty, staff, students, and reporters from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po, Ta Kung Pao, and New Evening News who were present to cover the news, damaging the Chinese journalists' photographic equipment. This is a serious atrocity by the Hong Kong British authorities to destroy and persecute the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon and to infringe upon the rights of Chinese journalists to conduct interviews.

　　The Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of the Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School was a completely premeditated action. As early as when the Hong Kong British authorities began fabricating the "dangerous building" excuse, attempting to persecute Chung Wah Middle School, the school submitted a request for repairs to the relevant departments, but the relevant departments deliberately delayed it in order to carry out their conspiracy to close the school. It must be pointed out that this kind of behavior by the Hong Kong British authorities to destroy and persecute the education of Chinese people and educators in Hong Kong and Kowloon is not the first time. Since the Hong Kong British authorities promulgated the Education (Amendment) Ordinance earlier this year, they have, under various pretexts, carried out many acts of destruction and persecution against the education of Chinese people and educators in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The incident in May this year when the Hong Kong British authorities prohibited Chinese schools from hanging the Chinese national flag during festivals and the incident on August 6 when they unreasonably and forcibly deported Du Bo Kui, the principal of Hong Kong Pui Kiu Middle School, are prominent examples. This series of persecutory actions cannot but lead people to believe that the Hong Kong British authorities are implementing a policy of deliberately destroying and persecuting the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

　　In contrast to the above situation, the Hong Kong British authorities have consistently adopted a policy of shielding and conniving with the Chiang Kai-shek clique elements in the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas who, under the guise of running schools, engage in propaganda and activities against and undermining the People's Republic of China. Not only that, the Hong Kong British authorities even openly stipulate that textbooks published by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which contain content slandering the People's Republic of China, be used as textbooks in Hong Kong and Kowloon schools. This proves that the Hong Kong British authorities, disregarding the repeated condemnations of the Chinese government, continue to implement a policy of hostility towards China and creating "two Chinas."

　　The Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon have always had the right to run their own educational undertakings. The freedom and personal safety guarantees that journalists should enjoy when conducting legitimate interviews are also internationally recognized rights. However, the Hong Kong British authorities not only destroy the education of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, but also instigate their police to wantonly beat Chinese faculty, staff, students, and journalists. This is a deliberate act of provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese government is extremely indignant about this and hereby lodges a strong protest with the British government, and demands that the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities immediately cease these provocative acts of hostility towards the Chinese people, ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, be responsible for compensating all losses to the injured and victimized personnel, punish the relevant police officers who committed the violence, unseal the Chung Wah Middle School, and reasonably resolve its repair issues so that the school can open on schedule, and guarantee the freedom and personal safety of Chinese journalists to conduct interviews. At the same time, the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities should immediately revoke the regulations regarding the adoption of textbooks published by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Hong Kong and Kowloon schools, and stop the Chiang Kai-shek clique elements from engaging in activities against and undermining China under the guise of running schools.

　　The Chinese government requests a prompt response from the British government.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Our Foreign Ministry today sent a note to the British Representative Office lodging a strong protest against the British military aircraft's repeated intrusion into Chinese airspace. The note reads as follows:

　　According to reports received by the Foreign Ministry from relevant departments, at 10:10 AM on August 16, 1958, a British Auster-type military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Shenzhen and Liantang in Baoan County, Guangdong Province, at low altitude from Hong Kong. At 12:35 PM on August 18, a military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Wai Lingding Island in Zhuhai County, Guangdong Province, circled seven times, and then flew back to Hong Kong.

　　It must be pointed out that not long ago, on May 20, 21, 22, and July 24, 1958, British military aircraft repeatedly intruded into the airspace of Baoan County, Guangdong Province, China. The Foreign Ministry successively lodged protests with the British government on May 24, June 18, and August 5, 1958, and requested the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities to immediately cease such provocative activities and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future. Although the British government's reply note of June 3, 1958, expressed "regret" regarding the British military aircraft's intrusion into Chinese airspace on May 22 and stated that "British aircraft departing from Hong Kong are bound by routine orders to exercise the utmost care to avoid flying over Chinese territory," the same note and the reply note of July 2 did not provide satisfactory answers to the Foreign Ministry's protest notes of May 24 and June 18, 1958. The British government has not yet responded to the Foreign Ministry's protest note of August 5, 1958.

　　The incidents of intrusion into Chinese airspace that occurred again on August 16 and August 18 indicate that the "constraints" on "British aircraft departing from Hong Kong" mentioned in the British government's above-mentioned reply note are not to be trusted. These facts show that the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities not only disregarded the solemn protests and statements made by the Chinese government in the past and did not take effective measures to stop such hostile provocative behavior, but also continued such hostile provocative activities. It must also be pointed out that these actions, which are aimed at conducting military reconnaissance and harassment activities, are of a very serious nature, especially at a time when the United States and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, are creating tension in the Taiwan Strait.

　　For this reason, the Chinese government once again lodges a strong protest with the British government and again requests the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities to immediately cease such provocative activities and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future. The Chinese government believes that the British government should apologize to the Chinese government for the British military aircraft's intrusion into Chinese airspace, should punish the relevant personnel who committed the provocation, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future. The Chinese government solemnly declares that if such activities do not cease, the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

　　我外交部向英代办处发出两个照会
    严重抗议香港当局蓄意寻衅  严重抗议英机侵犯我国领空
    新华社27日讯　我外交部今日照会英国代办处对香港英国当局强行封闭香港中华中学校舍和香港警察野蛮殴打该校教职员、学生和到场采访的中国新闻记者的事件向英国政府提出严重抗议。照会内容如下：
    1958年8月26日清晨，香港英国当局派遣大批武装警察，借口所谓“危险房屋”，使用暴力强行封闭香港中华中学的校舍，并且纵容武装警察野蛮殴打该校教职员、学生和在场采访新闻的新华社香港分社和香港文汇报、大公报、新晚报的记者，毁坏了中国记者的照相工具。这是一桩香港英国当局摧残和迫害港九中国人民的教育事业和侵犯中国新闻记者采访权利的严重暴行。
    香港英国当局强行封闭香港中华中学校舍完全是一种预谋的行动。早在香港英国当局开始制造“危险房屋”的借口，企图迫害中华中学的时候，该校就向主管部门提出修缮要求，但是，主管部门却故意拖延，以遂行其封闭该校的阴谋。必须指出，香港英国当局这种摧残和迫害港九中国人民教育事业和教育工作者的行为，已经不是第一次了。今年初，香港英国当局颁布教育（修正）条例后，就曾经在各种借口下对港九中国人民的教育事业和教育工作者进行过多次的摧残和迫害。今年5月间，香港英国当局禁止中国学校在节日悬挂中国国旗事件和8月6日无理强迫递解香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎出境的事件就是显著的例子。这一系列的迫害行动不能不使人认为，香港英国当局正在执行着蓄意摧残和迫害港九中国人民教育事业的政策。
    同上述的情况相反，香港英国当局对于蒋介石集团分子在港九地区假借办学之名进行反对和破坏中华人民共和国的宣传和活动，却一贯采取了包庇纵容的态度。不但如此，香港英国当局甚至公然规定蒋介石集团出版的以诬蔑中华人民共和国为内容的教科书作为港九学校的课本。这就证明，香港英国当局不顾中国政府的一再谴责，继续执行敌视中国和制造“两个中国”的政策。
    港九中国人民在当地从来就有举办自己的教育事业的权利。新闻记者在进行合法采访的时候所应享受的自由和人身安全的保证，也是国际上公认的权利。但是，香港英国当局不仅摧残港九中国人民的教育事业，而且唆使自己的警察肆意殴打中国的教职员、学生和新闻记者。这是对中国人民的蓄意寻衅行为。中国政府对此感到极大的愤慨，特向英国政府提出严重抗议，并且要求英国政府和香港英国当局立即停止这些敌视中国人民的寻衅行为，保证不再发生类似事件，负责赔偿受伤受害人员的一切损失，惩办有关行凶警察，启封中华中学校舍和合理解决其修缮问题，使该校得以如期开学，并且保证中国新闻记者的采访自由和人身安全。同时，英国政府和香港英国当局应该立即撤销关于港九学校采用蒋介石集团出版的课本的规定，制止蒋介石集团分子在办学的掩盖下进行反对和破坏中国的活动。
    中国政府要求英国政府迅速予以答复。
    新华社27日讯　我外交部今日照会英国代办处对英国军事飞机再次侵犯中国领空事件提出严重抗议。照会内容如下：
    据外交部接获有关部门的报告，1958年8月16日上午十时十分，一架英国奥斯特式军事飞机从香港低空侵入中国广东省宝安县深圳、莲塘等地上空。8月18日十二时三十五分一架军事飞机从香港低空侵入广东省珠海县外伶仃岛上空，盘旋七周后飞回。
    必须指出，在不久以前，即1958年5月20日、21日、22日和7月24日曾连续发生英国军事飞机侵犯中国广东省宝安县领空事件。外交部先后于1958年5月24日、6月18日和8月5日照会英国政府提出抗议，并且要求英国政府和香港英国当局立即停止这种挑衅活动和保证今后不再发生类似事件。英国政府1958年6月3日的复照虽然对5月22日英国军事飞机侵犯中国领空事件表示“歉意”，并且表示“自香港出动之英国飞机系受日常命令所约束，尽量小心避免飞越中国领土”，但是同一照会和7月2日的复照对于外交部1958年5月24日和6月18日的抗议照会并未作出令人满意的答复。英国政府对于外交部1958年8月5日的抗议照会则迄今尚未答复。
    8月16日和8月18日再次发生的侵犯中国领空的事件表明，英国政府上述复照中所谓对“自香港出动之英国飞机”的“约束”是不足置信的。这些事实说明了英国政府和香港英国当局不但无视于中国政府过去所作的严正的抗议和声明，没有采取有效措施制止这种敌意的挑衅行为，而且继续进行了这种敌意的挑衅活动。还必须指出，在美国和它的走狗蒋介石集团在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的时候这些旨在进行军事侦察和骚扰活动的行动，性质上是十分严重的。
    为此，中国政府再一次向英国政府提出严重抗议，并且再次要求英国政府和香港英国当局立即停止这种挑衅活动和保证今后不再发生类似事件。中国政府认为英国政府应该对英国军事飞机侵犯中国领空事件向中国政府道歉，应该对寻衅的有关人员加以惩办，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件。中国政府郑重声明：如果这种活动再不停止，英国政府和香港英国当局必须对由此产生的一切后果负完全的责任。
