Prince Sihanouk in Yangcun
By our reporter Wang Boqing

　　On the 21st, the Yangcun Railway Station in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, was like a scene of celebration. A colored archway was erected at the entrance of the station, and more than 500 members of the Yangcun agricultural cooperative, holding colored flags, lined up on the platform. They were there to welcome Prince Sihanouk, a good friend of the Chinese people, and other distinguished Cambodian guests on a friendly visit.
　　At 1 p.m., a beautiful train arrived from east to west. Before the train even entered the station, flags were waving on the platform and applause thundered. People rhythmically shouted: "Welcome, Prime Minister!", "Hello, Prime Minister!", "Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!". Amid the cheers, Prince Sihanouk, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, stepped off the train with a smile. As he walked past the welcoming crowd lining the path, the applause and slogans grew louder and louder. The Prime Minister had to applaud in response to the crowd on the left and then clasp his hands in thanks to the crowd on the right. The profound friendship between China and Cambodia, like relatives, and between the Chinese and Cambodian people, like brothers, was once again manifested here.
　　Prince Sihanouk braved the intense heat to visit Zhoujiawu Township in Yangcun Town, where he met with the township head, Pang Jifa, the township party secretary, Bai Keru, and others. The hosts introduced that the area used to be low-lying, with alkaline and barren land, suffering from floods nine years out of ten. In the past two years, the masses had risen up to build water conservancy projects, and many lands had been transformed into fertile paddy fields. This year, the grain yield per mu is expected to exceed 1,000 jin. Prince Sihanouk nodded in praise, saying, "Very good, very good, you are making rapid progress!" At the invitation of Township Head Pang Jifa, Prince Sihanouk stepped onto the fields to visit their paddy fields.
　　In the paddy field, there was a patch of rice growing particularly luxuriantly. Many wooden poles were planted on both sides of this paddy field, with wires crisscrossing on the poles, and purple light bulbs hanging every few feet. The Prime Minister asked with concern, "What are these light bulbs for?"
　　Pang Jifa told the distinguished guests, "This is an experimental field of two mu cultivated by cadres from Wuqing County, with 9.6 million plants per mu and an expected yield of over 50,000 jin per mu. Because it is so densely planted, we installed these electric lights to provide light to the rice at night and supplement the insufficient sunlight during the day." Sihanouk nodded repeatedly, full of admiration.
　　Here, the Prime Minister also watched artificial rainfall being applied to this paddy field. When several people pressed the wooden rainmaker installed by the canal, water sprayed into the air like a fountain from a long tube, falling evenly on the rice leaves. The Prime Minister was extremely happy and, tilting his head, was the first to raise his hand and applaud the artificial rain in the sky.
　　The Prime Minister continued to walk along a ridge, and more than a dozen girls working in the field stopped their work and applauded to welcome the Prime Minister. Premier Zhou asked them, "Are you a women's production team?" Chen Jiufang, who had two big braids, said yes. Premier Zhou then said, "Are you shy? Come out and tell the Prime Minister how you grow rice." Chen Jiufang walked out of the field, wiped her wet hands, and stepped forward to shake hands with the Prime Minister. She introduced, "This mu of land is an experimental field cultivated by our eleven young women, now with 900,000 plants, and we plan to harvest 10,000 jin of rice." She also said, "We want to exceed 10,000 jin, and we want to compete with the young men cultivating the experimental field over there." Prince Sihanouk nodded in praise.
　　Then, Prince Sihanouk traveled by car to Huiguokou Township in Yangcun Town and visited the eight-hole sluice hydropower station built with funds accumulated by twenty-four agricultural cooperatives there. Zhao Yong, the person in charge of the power station, introduced, "With this power station, we can not only use the electricity it generates to lift and drain water, but also use electric plows to cultivate the land, electric mills to grind flour, and drive choppers to chop grass." After the visit, members of the Huiguokou Township agricultural cooperative set up tables under the willow trees by the river and served the Prime Minister with their own grown watermelon, grapes, and fresh peaches. While eating the fruits, Prince Sihanouk said to Zhao Ke, the First Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, who was sitting opposite him, "You are treating us too well, I am really touched. We send telegrams to our country every day, reporting on how welcome we are." Zhao Ke said, "Our people are very happy to have the Prime Minister visit, and we also feel it is a great encouragement to us." At this time, Premier Zhou interjected, "When I visited Cambodia the year before last, the people there gave us a grand welcome, which still remains in our memory."

　　西哈努克首相在杨村
　　本报记者　汪波清
    21日，河北省武清县杨村火车站像办喜事一样，车站入口处搭起了彩门，五百多名杨村的农业社员，手执彩色小旗，列队站在站台上。他们是迎候中国人民的好朋友——西哈努克首相和柬埔寨的其他贵宾前来进行友好访问的。
    下午一时，一列漂亮的火车由东而西开来，火车还没有进站，站台上旗帜挥舞，掌声如雷，人们有节奏地喊着：“欢迎首相”，“首相您好”，“中柬友好万岁”。在一片欢呼声中，西哈努克首相在周恩来总理和陈毅副总理陪同下满面笑容地步下火车，当他走过夹道的欢迎群众的前面时，掌声、口号声一阵高过一阵，首相不得不一会向左边的人群鼓掌答谢，一会向右边的人群合十致意。中柬两国是亲戚，中柬人民是兄弟，这种深情厚谊在这里再一次体现出来。
    西哈努克首相冒着大热的天气，来到杨村镇的周家务乡，会见了乡长庞继发、乡党委书记白克儒等人。主人介绍说，这里过去地势低洼，碱大地瘦，十年九涝，这两年来群众奋起修水利，许多土地变成了肥沃的稻田，今年粮食每亩要产一千斤以上。西哈努克首相听了不断点头赞扬说：“很好，很好，你们进步很快！”应乡长庞继发的邀请，西哈努克首相踏着田垅来参观他们的稻田。
    在稻田中有一块稻子长得特别茁壮，在这块稻田两边栽了许多木棍，木棍上交错地架着电线，每隔几尺就挂一个紫色灯泡。首相关怀地问：“这些灯泡是做什么用的？”
    庞继发告诉贵宾说：“这是两亩武清县干部的试验田，每一亩有九百六十万株，亩产五万斤出头。因为长得密，为了在晚上也能给稻子照光，补充白天阳光的不足，所以我们想法子装了这些电灯。”西哈努克不断点头，赞赏不已。
    在这里，首相又看了人工给这块稻田降雨。当几个人把安在渠边的木制降雨器一压，水就像喷泉一样从一根长筒里喷向高空，又均匀地落在稻叶上面。首相高兴极了，他仰着头，第一个举起手对着高空的人工雨鼓起掌来。
    首相继续沿一道田垅向前走去，田里的十几个姑娘停了手里的活，鼓掌欢迎首相。周总理对着她们问道：“你们是妇女生产队吗？”留着两条大辫子的陈九芳说是。周总理又说：“怕羞吗？快出来向首相说说你们是怎么种稻子的。”陈九芳走出田来，擦了擦湿手，上前和首相握手。她介绍说：“这一亩田是我们十一个青年妇女种的试验田，现在有九十万株，计划要打一万斤稻子。”她还说：“我们要超过一万斤，要和那边种试验田的小伙子们比一比。”西哈努克首相听了点头赞扬她们。
    接着西哈努克首相又乘车来到杨村镇灰锅口乡，参观了那里的由二十四个农业社积资建造的八孔闸水电站。电站负责人赵勇介绍说：“我们有了这个电站，不仅可以用它发的电提水、排水，而且还可以用电犁耕地，用电磨磨面，用它带动铡刀铡草。”参观毕，灰锅口乡农业社社员们就在河边柳荫下摆了桌子，切好他们自种的西瓜、摆下葡萄、新鲜桃子招待首相。在吃着瓜果的时候，西哈努克首相向坐在他对面的中共天津地委第一书记赵克说：“你们对我们招待太好了，我真是感动，我们每天都往我们国内打电报，报告我们受欢迎的情形。”赵克说：“我们人民对首相来参观感到十分高兴，也感到对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。”这时，周总理插上说：“我前年访问柬埔寨，那里的人民隆重欢迎我们，至今还留在我们的记忆当中。”
