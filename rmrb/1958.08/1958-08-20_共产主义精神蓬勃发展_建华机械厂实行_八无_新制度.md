    Communist Spirit Flourishes
　　Jianhua Machinery Factory Implements New "Eight No's" System
　　No one sells meals, no one distributes wages, no one manages the tool room, no one manages the library, no one manages the recreation room, no one collects membership fees, no one sells movie tickets, no one sells bath tickets
    This newspaper, Qiqihar, 19th dispatch: In the rectification movement, workers at the Jianhua Machinery Factory in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, enhanced their class consciousness and established a communist style. Recently, the factory has seen new phenomena such as a canteen with no one selling meals, no one distributing wages, no one managing the tool room, no one managing the library, no one managing the recreation room, no one collecting membership fees, no one selling movie tickets, and no one selling bath tickets—the "Eight No's."
    After the Jianhua Factory underwent the rectification movement and implemented worker participation in management, cadre participation in labor, and a major reform of rules and regulations, a new atmosphere of "everyone putting politics in command, everyone doing ideological work, everyone seeking progress, and everyone treating the factory as home" formed among the factory's employees. Under this new political situation, the canteen management personnel, with the help and inspiration of the Party organization, first implemented the no-one-selling-meals system. This method involves employees paying for their meals themselves. The implementation of the no-one-selling-meals system not only gave the canteen management a new look but also created a win-win situation for leaders and the masses, canteen management personnel and dining employees.
    Following this, under the leadership of the Party Committee, all workshops in the factory successively applied this experience to enterprise management and welfare work.
    The specific method of implementing no-one-distributing-wages in this factory is as follows: at the end of the month or in the middle of the month when advances are made, the group accountant collects the collective wages due to the group from the workshop accountant, together with the wage calculation sheet, and places them in a designated location. Each worker can then use their rest time to take their due wages from it according to the wage calculation sheet, and stamp the wage calculation sheet to indicate that they have received it correctly. At the same time, everyone consciously pays their union dues and repays debts, etc. The implementation of the no-one-managing-tool-room system is the same: whoever uses a tool goes to the tool room to take it with a tag, and returns it immediately after use.
    The implementation of the "Eight No's" system in this factory not only reduced many complicated procedures, facilitated production and work, and reduced the production downtime of some management personnel and workers, but also brought about a new atmosphere in enterprise management. For example, before the equipment section of this factory implemented no-one-distributing-wages, the accountant had to ask two or three people to help each time wages were distributed, and errors often occurred, up to eight yuan. After the implementation of the no-one-distributing-wages system, workers consciously collect their personal due wages, and everyone is responsible to the collective, so this kind of error has been fundamentally eliminated.
    The implementation of the "Eight No's" system is the result of the workers' promotion of the communist spirit, and at the same time, it has further cultivated the communist style of the employees. For example, in the past, some workers had departmentalism problems when using tools and often engaged in personal "small warehouses." After the implementation of the no-one-managing-tool-room system, the workers' collectivist thinking has been enhanced. Not only is the tool room more orderly, but the "small warehouses" of some workers have also been consciously cleared up by the workers. The workers said: "The implementation of the no-one-managing system is the Party and the state's trust in our working class. We must respect this honor and run the no-one-managing system even better than the one managed by someone with the spirit of being masters of our own affairs." Some old workers said with emotion when taking their wages: "The old society said, 'Money makes the devil turn the millstone,' but the new society has no-one-managing wage distribution. The new and old societies are fundamentally different!"
    The first problem encountered in the implementation of the "Eight No's" system was the conservative thinking of some cadres and employees who did not trust the masses. In the beginning, some people did not dare to boldly support and promote this new thing. Secondly, a very small number of employees who liked to take advantage took the opportunity to take petty advantages. The Party organization of this factory overcame this shortcoming by strengthening individual education for such people and carrying out mass mutual supervision. In addition, when the "Eight No's" system was first implemented, because it was very popular among the masses, there was a situation where it was implemented without sufficient deliberation and preparation. This easily leads to errors and affects the enthusiasm of the masses in promoting the communist style. This factory also paid attention to solving this problem in a timely manner.
    The "Eight No's" new system created by the employees of the Jianhua Factory has been valued by the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee and welcomed by the city's employees. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Trade Union have successively held two on-site meetings at the Jianhua Machinery Factory to promote their experience. At present, this experience has blossomed and borne fruit in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city.

### 共产主义精神蓬勃发展　建华机械厂实行“八无”新制度

    共产主义精神蓬勃发展
　　建华机械厂实行“八无”新制度
　　无人售饭菜，无人发放工资，无人管理工具库，无人管理图书室，无人管理游艺室，无人收会费，无人收售电影票，无人收售洗澡票
    本报齐齐哈尔19日电  黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市建华机械厂职工在整风运动中提高了阶级觉悟，树立了共产主义风格。最近，这个厂出现了无人售饭菜食堂、无人发放工资、无人管理工具库、无人管理图书室、无人管理游艺室、无人收会费、无人收售电影票、无人收售洗澡票等“八无”的新气象。
    建华厂经过整风运动和推行工人参加管理、干部参加劳动、规章制度大改革以后，全厂职工中形成了“人人政治挂帅，人人做思想工作，人人要求进步，人人以厂为家”的风气。在这种新的政治局面下，食堂管理人员经党组织帮助启发，首先实行了无人售饭菜制度。这个办法是职工们自己交钱，自己拿饭。实行无人售饭菜制度以后，不但使食堂管理工作面貌一新，而且出现了领导和群众、食堂管理人员和就食职工皆大欢喜的局面。
    紧接着，在党委的领导下，全厂各车间也先后纷纷把这一经验运用到企业管理和福利事业工作中去。
    这个厂实行无人发放工资的具体作法是：在月末开支或月中借支时，由小组核算员从车间会计员处领来本组应得的集体工资，随同工资计算表一齐放在指定地点；每个工人就可以利用休息时间，按工资计算表将自己应得工资从中取出来，并在工资计算表上盖章表明收到无误。与此同时，每个人都自觉地缴纳工会会费、还欠款等。实行无人管理工具库制度，也同样是谁用工具，谁自己到工具库挂牌领取，用完后立即交回。
    这个厂实行“八无”新制度，不但减少了许多繁杂手续，便利了生产和工作，减少了部分管理人员和工人的生产间断工时，而且使企业管理出现了新气象。例如，这个厂设备科实行无人发放工资以前，每次发放工资时，会计员都得请两三个人帮忙，并且经常发生差错，多至八元。实行无人发放工资制度以后，工人们自觉地领取个人应得工资，每个人都对集体负责，这种差错现象就从根本上消除了。
    实行“八无”新制度是工人们发扬共产主义精神的结果，同时它又进一步培养了职工们的共产主义风格。如过去部分工人使用工具有本位主义的毛病，常搞个人小仓库。实行无人管理工具库以后，工人们的集体主义思想增强了。不但工具库更加井然有序，原来一些工人的“小仓库”，也被工人们自觉地清除了。工人们说：“实行无人管理制度，是党和国家对我们工人阶级的信任。我们一定要尊重这种荣誉，以当家做主的精神把无人管理搞得比有人管理还要好。”有的老工人在自己取工资时感慨地说：“旧社会说‘有钱能使鬼推磨’，新社会却出现了无人管理发工资，真是新旧社会根本不同了！”
    在实行“八无”制度中，首先碰到的问题，是部分干部和职工有不相信群众的保守思想。开始时，有些人不敢大胆地支持和推广这种新事物。其次是，极少数好占小便宜的职工乘机取巧。这个厂的党组织用加强对这种人的个别教育和开展群众性的互相监督的办法，克服了这个缺点。另外，开始推行“八无”制度时，因为很受群众欢迎，曾经出现过不进行充分酝酿和准备就推行的情况，这样，容易发生差错，并会影响群众发扬共产主义风格的积极性。这个厂也及时注意解决了这个问题。
    建华厂职工创造的“八无”新制度，受到中共齐齐哈尔市委的重视和全市职工的欢迎，市委和市工会先后在建华机械厂召开了两次现场会议，推广了他们的经验。目前，这一经验已在全市工矿企业中开花结果。
