Xinhua News Agency, August 5th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS, August 4th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, told a group of editors and reporters from Indian newspapers that the main issue at present is to prevent public opinion and the people of all countries from being deceived by the various tricks of the colonialists, and to more resolutely condemn the aggressive activities of certain Western countries against the Near and Middle Eastern countries. The people should insist on the withdrawal of interventionist troops and spare no effort to strive for a permanent end to the use of imperialist methods to solve international problems. In short, it is necessary to strive to establish relations between countries with different internal systems on the basis of "Panchsheel" (the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence).

Khrushchev met with this group of Indian newspaper editors and reporters on July 29th, who were visiting Moscow after attending the Stockholm Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference. He made these remarks in response to their question: What form of joint action can the Soviet Union, India, and other Eastern countries take to maintain world peace?

Khrushchev emphasized the need to strive to strengthen national and social relations between socialist countries and former colonial countries, as well as countries that are being liberated from colonialism. He said that all socialist countries understand their role in this way, which is to help each other and to help those countries that are being or have been liberated from the oppression of colonialists, without interfering in the internal affairs of these countries.

Khrushchev said that the landing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan was intended to attack and eliminate the Republic of Iraq, launch a war in the region, eliminate the United Arab Republic, and create conditions for the restoration of the old colonial system.

However, under the pressure of the wave of popular protests, the aggressors had to conceal their aggressive activities. Khrushchev emphasized that the danger has not been eliminated. The interventionists have been temporarily contained. They have now stopped their rampant activities, but forces continue to gather. Khrushchev said that in this situation, peace-loving countries should show special vigilance.

Khrushchev pointed out that if in the past American figures did not openly admit their role as colonialists, they can no longer hide this fact from the people of all countries. Now, the people see more clearly that there is essentially no difference between British imperialists and American imperialists, because they are both using force against the vital interests of all countries striving for national independence.

In response to the question of what the future of a high-level meeting would be after the landing of American and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan, Khrushchev said that the American leaders have been doing everything possible in the past and present to prevent this meeting from taking place. However, they are under great pressure from the people and dare not openly state their attempts to sabotage the meeting, but rather try to conceal their efforts in this regard and create various complicated procedural issues that hinder the convening of high-level talks. The role of the British in the current situation is roughly the same as that of the Americans.

Khrushchev expressed his belief that the British and Americans will eventually withdraw their troops from Jordan and Lebanon, because the people of Jordan and Lebanon will never give up until they achieve their goals.

When asked about his views on the development prospects of international relations, Khrushchev said, "It is best to wait and see before determining the prospects, because international relations are in a state of crisis." He went on to say, "It takes some time to determine whether the course of international relations is progressing in a good direction or a bad direction." At the same time, he believes that peace-loving people will surely fight back against the bellicose colonialists, and the aggressors will have to consider the forces that advocate peace, oppose war, and oppose colonialism.

The Soviet head of government pointed out that during the visit of President Nasser of the United Arab Republic to Moscow, it was agreed that all measures must be taken to ensure the peace and independence of the Arab countries. Khrushchev said that we have no differences, and we hold a consistent view on the assessment of the situation in the Near and Middle East caused by the US-British aggression.

Referring to the Soviet Union's efforts to expand and strengthen its friendship with India, Khrushchev pointed out that in the past, some works by Soviet authors had incorrect evaluations of certain figures in India. He said that we are working to correct this in order to give due recognition to all those who are truly great for their country and who have made great contributions to the cause of India's liberation from the colonialists. Khrushchev said that we admire their outstanding activities.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers warmly hoped that the Indian people would be able to enjoy all the fruits of independence that India had won in its struggle against the colonialists.

    赫鲁晓夫说各国人民应当提高警惕
    不受殖民主义者花招的迷惑  坚持要美英侵略军撤出中东
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对一批印度报刊的编辑和记者说：目前主要的问题是，要使各国舆论和人民不受殖民主义者的各种花招的迷惑，并且更坚决地谴责某些西方国家对中近东国家的侵略活动。人民应当坚持要求干涉军撤退，应当不遗余力地争取永远结束用帝国主义的方法解决各种国际问题。简单地说，必须争取做到：使内部制度不同的国家之间的关系建立在“潘查希拉”（即五项原则）的基础上。
    赫鲁晓夫在7月29日接见了这批在参加过斯德哥尔摩裁军和国际合作大会之后来莫斯科访问的印度报刊的编辑和记者。他是在回答他们提出的一个问题时这样说的，这个问题是：苏联、印度和其他东方国家为了维护世界和平可能采取什么形式的共同行动？
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出了必须竭力加强社会主义国家同过去的殖民地国家以及正在从殖民主义下解放出来的国家之间的国家关系和社会方面的关系。他说，所有社会主义国家都是这样来理解自己的作用的，这就是要互相帮助，并且帮助那些正在或者已经从殖民主义者的压迫下解放出来的国家，不干涉这些国家的内政。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美英两国军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆是为了以后进攻并且消灭伊拉克共和国，在这个地区发动战争，来消灭阿拉伯联合共和国，并且造成使旧的殖民主义制度复辟的条件。
    但是，侵略者在人民抗议浪潮的压力下不得不把他们的侵略活动加以掩饰。赫鲁晓夫强调说，危险还没有消除。干涉者暂时被遏止住了。他们现在停止了猖狂的活动，但是兵力在继续集结。赫鲁晓夫说，在这种情况下，爱好和平的国家应当表现出特别的警惕性。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，如果说，从前美国人士不公开承认他们的殖民主义者的作用的话，那么，现在他们在各国人民面前无论如何也无法掩盖这个事实了。现在，人民更清楚地看到，英国帝国主义者和美国帝国主义者之间实质上毫无区别，因为它们都是用武力反对一切争取民族独立的国家的切身利益的。
    在回答当美国和英国军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆以后，目前高级会议的前途如何这一问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，美国领导人过去和现在都是千方百计使这个会议开不成。但是，他们受到人民的很大压力，不敢公开讲出他们破坏会议的企图，而要把他们在这方面的努力加以掩饰，制造出种种妨碍高级会谈召开的复杂的程序问题。英国人在目前局势中的作用大致同美国一样。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，英国人和美国人终将把他们的军队从约旦和黎巴嫩撤出的，因为约旦和黎巴嫩的人民不达到自己的目的，决不罢休。
    有人请他谈谈他对国际关系的发展前景的看法，赫鲁晓夫说，“目前最好等一等再来确定前景，因为国际关系正处在危机状态”。他接着说，“需要过一些时间才能确定国际关系发展的过程是向着哪个方向进展——向好的方向还是向坏的方向”。同时他认为，爱好和平的人民一定会反击好战的殖民主义者，侵略者将不得不考虑主张和平、反对战争和殖民主义的力量。
    苏联政府首脑指出，在阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔访问莫斯科期间曾经约定，必须采取一切措施来保障阿拉伯国家的和平和独立。赫鲁晓夫说，我们没有分歧，我们对由于美英侵略而造成的中近东局势的估计持有一致的见解。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联努力扩大和加强同印度的友谊时指出，在过去，苏联作者的某些著作中曾经对印度某些人士有过不正确的评价。他说，我们正在努力纠正这一点，以便给予所有对本国来说是真正伟大的人和对印度从殖民主义者手中解放出来的事业做出很大贡献的人以应有的地位。赫鲁晓夫说，我们敬佩他们的杰出活动。
    苏联部长会议主席热烈希望印度人民能够享受印度在同殖民主义者斗争中所赢得的独立的一切果实。
