Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. TASS Moscow, July 30th: Colonel N. Denisov wrote in an article published in "Pravda" that new facts arriving daily via telegram show that the aggressive plans of the US and British imperialists are expanding. The armed forces used by imperialism to implement its aggressive plans in the Near and Middle East are increasing daily. Currently, the land forces gathered there total nearly 70,000. The United States and Britain have a total of approximately 1,000 aircraft of various types at air bases and aircraft carriers in the region. The aggressors' naval power is estimated at 1,200 warships and landing craft.

Denisov pointed out that it is clear that the war plans of the US and British warmongers are designed to cater to the will of the oil monopolies. All progressive humanity is angrily condemning the imperialist forces for launching colonial wars against the Arab countries struggling for freedom and national independence. People of all countries demand an immediate halt to the aggression and the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. According to TASS Beirut, July 30th: The scale of the US armed intervention in Lebanon is growing. Thirteen warships of the US Sixth Fleet anchored in Beirut harbor on the morning of the 30th, including an aircraft carrier. In addition, four giant US transport ships loaded with military equipment and weapons arrived in Antelias, six kilometers north of Beirut. Three more transport ships are waiting in the port to unload. At the same time, US military aircraft continue to transport troops and weapons to Beirut International Airport.

Lebanese sources have pointed out that the US military command intends to use the troops landed in Lebanon to suppress the uprising movement in Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. Amman dispatch: British transport planes carried 30 to 40 British aggressor troops to Aqaba Port Airport in southern Jordan on the 30th. This is another batch of new aggressor troops invading Jordan, following the British airlift of 2,000 paratroopers into Amman more than ten days ago. The invasion of Aqaba shows that Britain is expanding its occupied area of Jordan, controlling Jordan's only seaport.

According to Reuters, the British transport of aggressor troops through Aqaba Port Airport also shows that the British Air Force is opening a new route for transporting aggressor troops and supplies to Jordan.

The British aggressor troops in Jordan are viciously helping the tottering Jordanian puppet King Hussein suppress the Jordanian people and arrest patriotic Jordanian officers and people.

According to a spokesman for the British aggressor air force, the US Air Force has dispatched twelve giant four-engine transport planes, airlifting military supplies daily from Cyprus to the British aggressor troops in Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 31st. The military spokesman of the First Army of the United Arab Republic announced in Damascus on the 30th that a Turkish military jeep full of soldiers invaded Syrian territory at Bab Hawa on the afternoon of July 30th, penetrating about 50 meters into Syrian territory.

The spokesman said that the Turkish military vehicle continued to advance despite the orders of the United Arab Republic border guards to stop. The border guards opened fire, followed by a gun battle lasting about fifteen minutes, and the invading Turkish soldiers were forced to retreat.

The spokesman said that Turkish troops are still gathering on some mountains near the Syrian border.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. Amman dispatch: US President's "Special Envoy" Murphy, who has been engaged in tense behind-the-scenes conspiracies in Beirut for two weeks, arrived in Amman again on the afternoon of July 30th, attempting to save the tottering small court of Jordanian King Hussein and plotting new conspiracies against the Arab national independence movement.

After arriving in Amman, this veteran conspirator immediately held secret talks with Hussein, who has recently been alarmed by the rising tide of domestic anger against his corrupt rule. He is also scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Rifai.

At Amman Airport, Murphy said that his purpose in coming to Amman was to quickly study the situation in Jordan and "explain US policy" to the Jordanian authorities. According to sources at the US Embassy in Jordan, Murphy will discuss with Hussein and Rifai the issue of Hussein's recent request for the United States to provide Jordan with "military assistance" like Britain. Hussein and Rifai have publicly requested that the United States send troops to Jordan.

After a series of tense talks in Jordan, Murphy is scheduled to travel to Israel on the 31st to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir, and then return to Beirut on the same day.

    墨菲前往安曼策划反阿拉伯人民的勾当
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：恩·杰尼索夫上校在“真理报”发表的文章写道，每天电报传来的新事实表明，美英帝国主义者的侵略计划正在日益扩大。帝国主义用来实现自己在中近东侵略计划的武装部队日益增加。目前，在那里集结的陆军就将近有七万名。美国和英国在这个地区的空军基地和航空母舰上共计有一千架左右各种用途的飞机。侵略者的海军力量估计有一千二百艘军舰和登陆舰。
    杰尼索夫指出，很显然，美英好战分子的作战计划是为了迎合石油垄断组织的意旨。一切进步人类都愤怒地谴责帝国主义势力发动殖民战争，反对争取自由和民族独立的阿拉伯各国人民。各国人民要求立即停止侵略，要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特30日讯：美国对黎巴嫩武装干涉的规模越来越大。美国第六舰队的十三艘军舰30日早上在贝鲁特港口下碇，其中有一艘是航空母舰。另外有四艘满载军事装备和武器的美国巨型运输船到达了贝鲁特以北六公里的安特利亚斯。还有三艘运输船在港口等着卸货。同时美军飞机继续把军队和武器运到贝鲁特国际机场。
    黎巴嫩人士已经指出，美军司令部打算利用在黎巴嫩登陆的军队来镇压黎巴嫩国内的起义运动。
    新华社31日讯　安曼消息：英国运输机30日运载了三、四十名英国侵略军到达约旦南部的亚喀巴港机场。这是继十多天前英国空运两千名伞兵侵入安曼以后，侵入约旦的又一批新侵略军。侵入亚喀巴一事表明英国正在扩大它对约旦的侵占区，控制约旦的唯一出海港。
    据路透社透露，英国这次通过亚喀巴港机场运入侵略军也表明，英国空军正在开辟一条运送侵略军和供应品到约旦去的新航线。
    在约旦的英国侵略军正在凶恶地帮助摇摇欲坠的约旦傀儡国王侯赛因镇压约旦国内人民，逮捕约旦的爱国军官和人士。
    据英国侵略空军发言人承认，美国空军已经出动了十二架巨型的四引擎运输机，每天从塞浦路斯岛空运军用品给在约旦的英国侵略军队。
    新华社大马士革31日电　阿拉伯联合共和国第一军的军事发言人30日在大马士革宣布，满载士兵的一辆土耳其军队的吉普车在7月30日下午在巴卜哈瓦地方侵入叙利亚地区，并且深入叙利亚地区的领土约五十公尺。
    这位发言人说，这辆土耳其军用车不顾阿拉伯联合共和国边防军制止前进的口令而继续前进，边防军因而开枪，接着发生枪战约十五分钟，入侵的土耳其士兵被迫撤退。
    这位发言人说，目前还有土耳其军队集结在接近叙利亚地区边界的一些山上。
    新华社31日讯　安曼消息：两个星期来一直在贝鲁特进行紧张的幕后阴谋活动的美国总统“特使”墨菲，又在7月30日下午到达安曼，企图挽救约旦国王侯赛因的摇摇欲坠的小朝廷，并且策划反对阿拉伯民族独立运动的新阴谋。
    这个老牌阴谋家在到达安曼后，立即同最近由于国内反对腐朽统治的怒潮日益高涨而惊慌不安的侯赛因举行了密谈。他还预定同首相里法伊会谈。
    墨菲在安曼机场上说，他到安曼的目的是迅速研究一下约旦的局势，并且向约旦当局“解释美国的政策”。据美国驻约旦大使馆人士说，墨菲将同侯赛因和里法伊商谈侯赛因最近所提出的希望美国像英国一样给予约旦“军事援助”问题。侯赛因和里法伊曾经先后公然要求美国派兵到约旦去。
    墨菲在约旦进行一系列的紧张会谈之后，预定在31日前往以色列，同以色列总理本—古里安和外交部长梅厄夫人会谈，然后在同一天回到贝鲁特去。
