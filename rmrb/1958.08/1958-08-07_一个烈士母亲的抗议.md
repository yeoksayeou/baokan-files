    As the claws of the American and British invading forces began to reach into the lands of the Middle East, the old and new hatreds of Jin Yonghua, a people's representative of Chongqing and a revolutionary martyr's family member, surged into her heart. She recalled the tragic scene of her eldest son, Communist Party member Wang Pu, being murdered by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents at the Sino-American Cooperative Organization in 1949. She remembered the righteous act of sending her second son to be a volunteer soldier when the American invading forces invaded Korea; and thought of the mothers and children in the Middle East being threatened by the flames of war from the invading forces, and felt very emotional.

    She thought: as a martyr's mother and a woman of New China, she should stand up and fight the aggressors to defend peace. Therefore, she actively exposed and denounced the barbaric acts of American and British imperialism to her relatives and neighbors, so that more people would hate the American and British aggressors even more. In the past ten days or so, this old woman, who is almost sixty years old, has often braved the hundred-degree Fahrenheit heat, running around to participate in protest rallies and oral propaganda work. One day, she went to Chongqing People's Broadcasting Station to participate in the city-wide workers, farmers, and People's Liberation Army radio rally protesting against the American and British invasion of the Middle East. Standing in front of the loudspeaker, she said angrily: American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people in the world. I will never allow the bloodstained hands of American imperialism that slaughtered my eldest son to kill the people of the Middle East again.

    Old Mrs. Jin Yonghua also wrote letters to many relatives and students far away in Shandong, Shanghai, Beijing and other places. In a letter to Mao Xinglong, an air force soldier of the People's Liberation Army and her student, she wrote: "You must remember the blood debt of the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who killed Wang Pu, and you must not allow the American and British imperialist invading forces to harm the people of the Middle East. You must be a hundred times more vigilant, further hone your skills, and be ready to strike at the American and British invading forces at any time."

    Now, Old Mrs. Jin Yonghua reads the newspaper every day, closely watching the development of the Middle East incident. One day, her son Wang Su, who is studying at Chongqing University, returned home and told her that if the American and British aggressors expand the war in the Middle East, he is willing to give up his studies and join the army. Jin Yonghua praised her son as soon as she heard his words. She encouraged her son to work hard to exercise his body and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.

    一个烈士母亲的抗议
    新华社记者　义道
    当美、英侵略军的魔爪开始伸进中东土地的时候，重庆市人民代表、革命烈士家属金永华老太太的旧恨新仇，就一齐涌上心头。她想起1949年大儿子、共产党员王朴被中美合作所美蒋特务杀害的惨景：想起美国侵略军侵略朝鲜，她将第二个儿子送去当志愿军的正义行为；想起中东地区的母亲和孩子们正在受着侵略军的战火的威胁，心里十分激动。
    她想：作为一个烈士的母亲、新中国的妇女，应该挺身而出和侵略者进行斗争，保卫和平。于是，她就积极在亲邻中揭发、控诉美英帝国主义的野蛮行为，让更多的人更加仇视美英侵略者。最近十多天来，这位快满六十岁的老人经常冒着华氏一百度的酷暑，四处奔走参加抗议集会和口头宣传工作。有一天，她到重庆人民广播电台参加了全市工人、农民、解放军抗议美英侵略中东广播大会。她站在扩音器前愤怒地说：美帝国主义是世界爱好和平人民最凶恶的敌人，我决不允许美帝国主义屠杀我大儿子的血手，再去杀害中东人民。
    金永华老太太还给许多远在山东、上海、北京等地的亲友和学生写信。她在给解放军空军战士、她的学生毛兴隆的信中写道：“你要记住美蒋特务杀害王朴的血债，决不能让美英帝国主义侵略军残害中东人民。你要百倍提高警惕，进一步苦练本领，随时准备打击美、英侵略军。”
    现在，金永华老太太天天都读报，密切注视着中东事件的发展。一天，在重庆大学读书的儿子王肃回家向她说，一旦美英侵略者扩大中东战火，他愿意投笔从军。金永华一听到儿子的话，就很称赞。她鼓励儿子要努力锻炼身体，随时准备响应祖国的号召。
