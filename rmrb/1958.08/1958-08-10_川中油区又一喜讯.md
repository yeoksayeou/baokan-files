    Another Good News from the Central Sichuan Oilfield
    The No. 2 deep exploration well on the Hechuan structure in the Central Sichuan Oilfield gushed crude oil on August 3rd when it reached a depth of 1,128 meters during drilling.
    The Hechuan structure is located between the Jialing River and the Qu River, southeast of the Longnüsi structure. It is the fourth oil-producing structure in the Central Sichuan Oilfield, following Nanchong, Penglaizhen, and Longnüsi. The oil production from this structure confirms that the oil-bearing area in the Central Sichuan Oilfield is very extensive.

    川中油区又一喜讯
    川中油区合川构造上的二号深探井8月3日在钻进到一千一百二十八公尺的时候，喷出原油。
    合川构造位于嘉陵江和渠江之间，在龙女寺构造的东南，是川中油区继南充、蓬莱镇、龙女寺之后的第四个喷油构造。这一构造喷油，证实了川中油区储油面积非常广阔。
