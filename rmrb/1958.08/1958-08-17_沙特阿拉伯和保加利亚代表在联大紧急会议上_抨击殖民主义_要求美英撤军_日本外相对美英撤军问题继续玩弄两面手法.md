Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th—The United Nations General Assembly emergency special session continued its meetings on the morning and afternoon of August 15th.

　　The first to speak was Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu, who attempted to defend Turkey's role as an accomplice in the American aggression.
　　Saudi Arabian delegation head Shukairy strongly condemned colonialism in his speech and demanded the complete withdrawal of imperialist troops from the Middle East.
　　Shukairy disagreed with U.S. President Eisenhower's assertion that the situation in the Middle East was caused by certain Arab countries' "aggressive leaders," "indirect aggression," "subversion," and "propaganda offensives."
　　He said that if the reasons were analyzed conscientiously and fairly, the crisis in the Middle East was a conflict between the Arab world and the West. Regarding the current situation in the Middle East, the West should only blame itself and no one else.
　　Shukairy said that many solutions to the Middle East problem have been put forward in the United Nations General Assembly. Among these solutions, at least one should be unwavering, and that is the withdrawal of foreign troops. He said that we support any proposal that calls for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, not only from Lebanon and Jordan, but also from any Arab land.
　　Shukairy criticized Western countries for not respecting the national aspirations of the Arabs, and he disagreed with Eisenhower's so-called plan to help Middle Eastern countries develop their economies. Shukairy said that Eisenhower's plan "is not the key to solving the Middle East problem." He said that unless colonialism is eliminated in the Middle East, any Middle East economic development plan cannot be started.
　　Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama acknowledged in his speech that the rise of nationalism in the Middle East is an inevitable trend of historical development, and no one can turn back the clock.
　　Fujiyama said that Japan still believes that the long-term presence of American and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan "may cause adverse consequences." But he immediately added that his government believes that in order for the United States and Britain to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan "at an early date," the United Nations should first take so-called "necessary safeguards."
　　Aiichiro Fujiyama's speech shows that Japan is still playing its original two-faced trick on the issue of demanding the withdrawal of US and British troops.
　　The last to speak at the morning session was Iranian representative Abdoh.
　　In the afternoon session, the representatives of New Zealand and Bulgaria spoke. The New Zealand representative's speech did not offer anything new, but merely repeated some of the arguments of the US and British aggressors and the representatives of countries with military alliances with the aggressors.
　　Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov refuted the deceptive arguments used to justify the aggression in his speech.
　　Lukanov said that the Bulgarian government and people are particularly concerned about the situation in the Near East caused by the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, because these acts of aggression are taking place near Bulgaria, and any war in the Near East is a direct threat to Bulgaria.
　　Lukanov pointed out that the real reasons for the US-British aggression in the Middle East are: First, the monopoly capital of Western countries is concerned with maintaining and expanding the oil resources they plunder; second, the imperialist forces want to turn this region of the world into their strategic base to oppose the growing national liberation movement in the Middle East and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.
　　The Bulgarian Foreign Minister expressed support for the Soviet proposal.
　　The next meeting of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled for August 18.

　　沙特阿拉伯和保加利亚代表在联大紧急会议上
　　抨击殖民主义　要求美英撤军
　　日本外相对美英撤军问题继续玩弄两面手法
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会紧急特别会议15日上午和下午继续举行会议。
    首先发言的是土耳其外交部长佐鲁，他在发言中企图为土耳其做美国侵略行动的帮凶这一点作辩解。
    沙特阿拉伯代表团团长舒凯里在发言时猛烈抨击殖民主义，并且要求帝国主义军队全部撤出中近东。
    舒凯里不同意美国总统艾森豪威尔的这种说法：中近东局势是由于某些阿拉伯国家的“侵略性的领导人物”，由于“间接侵略”、“颠覆活动”和“宣传攻势”等等而造成的。
    他说，如果凭良心地、公正地分析原因的话，中东的危机乃是阿拉伯世界同西方的冲突。在中东的当前局势上，西方只应该谴责自己，不应该谴责任何其他人。
    舒凯里说，现在在联合国大会上已经提出了许多解决中近东问题的办法。这些办法中至少有一个应当是不能有丝毫动摇的，这就是撤出外国军队。他说，我们支持任何一个要求外国军队立即撤出的提案，这些军队不但要撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，而且要撤出任何一块阿拉伯土地。
    舒凯里抨击西方国家没有尊重阿拉伯的民族愿望，他并且不同意艾森豪威尔提出的所谓帮助中东国家发展经济的计划。舒凯里说，艾森豪威尔的计划“并不是解决中东问题的钥匙”，他说，除非在中东清除了殖民主义，任何中东经济发展计划都是无法着手进行的。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎在发言中承认，中近东民族主义的兴起是历史发展的必然趋势，谁也不能把时钟拨回去。
    藤山说，日本仍然认为，美英两国军队长期驻在黎巴嫩和约旦“可能引起不良后果”。但是他立刻接着说，他的政府认为，为了使美国和英国“早日”从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军，联合国应当先采取所谓“必要的保证措施”。
    藤山爱一郎的发言表明，在要求美英撤军的问题上，日本仍然在玩弄原来的两面派手法。
    上午会议上最后一个发言的是伊朗代表阿卜杜。
    在下午会议上，新西兰和保加利亚两国的代表讲了话。新西兰代表的发言没有谈出什么新的东西，而只是重复了美英侵略者以及同侵略者有军事集团联系的国家的代表的一些论据。
    保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫在发言中驳斥了为侵略辩护的骗人论据。
    卢卡诺夫说，保加利亚政府和人民特别关心由于美国和英国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦而造成的近东局势，因为这些侵略活动是在保加利亚附近发生的，近东的任何战火都是对保加利亚的直接威胁。
    卢卡诺夫指出，美英侵略中东的真正的原因是：一、西方国家的垄断资本关心保持和扩大它们所掠夺的石油富源；二、帝国主义势力想要把世界的这个地区变成它们的战略基地来反对中近东日益增长的民族解放运动，并且反对苏联和其他社会主义国家。
    保加利亚外交部长表示支持苏联提案。
    联合国大会下次会议定于8月18日举行。
