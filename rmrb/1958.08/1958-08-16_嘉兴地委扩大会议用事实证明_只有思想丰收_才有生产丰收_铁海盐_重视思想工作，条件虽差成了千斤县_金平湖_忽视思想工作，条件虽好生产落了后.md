According to Zhejiang Daily news: The Chinese Communist Party Zhejiang Jiaxing Prefectural Committee, based on the new situation after the early rice harvest, promptly convened an enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee to conduct rectification. This rectification meeting used the method of setting up opposing sides, adopting the method of comparing output, comparing levels, and finding reasons, summarized the leadership experience of Haiyan, Haining, Chongde, and Tongxiang counties in achieving a great early rice harvest, and examined the reasons why Pinghu, Jiashan, and Changxing counties had slower leaps forward and lower yields in the past six months. Through summarizing and examining, it drew experiences and lessons, and found a concrete path to strive for a greater harvest of late rice and autumn crops.

This year, Jiaxing area achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. The total output is expected to exceed 1.6 billion jin, and the average yield per mu is about 700 jin. However, this output is unbalanced. According to statistics on August 5th, the average unit yield of early rice in Haining County was 1,037 jin, in Haiyan County it was 1,018 jin, in Chongde County it was 1,005 jin, in Tongxiang County it was 913 jin, in Pinghu County and Jiashan County it was about 600 jin, and in Changxing County it was 547 jin. In Jiaxing Prefecture, there has always been the saying "Golden Pinghu, Silver Jiashan, Iron Haiyan." The production conditions in Pinghu and Jiashan are superior to those in Haiyan, but this year the early rice yield in Haiyan County is much higher than that in Pinghu and Jiashan counties; Changxing County borders Anji County, and the production conditions are better than those in Anji, but the early rice yield is lower than that in Anji (the unit yield of early rice in Anji is 580 jin). This contrasting fact cannot but attract people's attention. Why is the yield higher where production conditions are relatively poor, while the yield is lower where production conditions are relatively good? Obviously, we cannot find the reason in objective conditions, but only in subjective ones.

At the meeting, the responsible comrades of Haiyan, Pinghu, and other seven counties, as well as the responsible comrades of other counties, unanimously agreed in their speeches that the most important experience and lesson in the first half of the year was: wherever they grasped rectification as the key link and insisted on making political and ideological work take the lead in all work, the work there would show a vigorous and continuously leaping forward situation. On the contrary, wherever rectification and political and ideological work were neglected, the whole work would be characterized by insufficient vigor, slow leaps forward, and insignificant production achievements. Haiyan County and Pinghu County are obvious contrasts. This spring, the Haiyan County Party Committee first grasped rectification within the County Party Committee, constantly using advanced examples emerging from the masses as teaching materials, repeatedly carrying out the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking within the County Party Committee, and at the same time seriously criticizing decentralism and individualism within the County Party Committee, ensuring the unity of thought and concentration of strength of the County Party Committee, eliminating various right-leaning conservative ideas, boldly leading the masses to engage in the movement to create 1,000-dan fertilizer and reform agricultural tools, and grasping field management, thus achieving the great achievement of becoming a thousand-jin county. In the township and commune grassroots organizations of this county, they also insisted on rectifying the thinking and work style of cadres and rectifying organizations through rectification, inserting red flags and removing white flags. For example, Guantang Township was originally a third-class township, with declining production and troubles year after year. Through rectification, more than 40 township and commune cadres with serious capitalist ideas or incompetent were replaced, and the masses were mobilized to speak out and debate. All township and commune cadres cultivated experimental plots, and the instructions of the County Party Committee were generally implemented overnight. In the most difficult places, cadres always took the lead in hard work. Therefore, this township became a thousand-jin township this year. The main reason for the low yield in Pinghu County is that the rectification within the County Party Committee was not thorough, some members were sluggish and lacked enthusiasm, lacked the necessary enthusiasm for learning from and catching up with the advanced, and the implementation of the instructions of the higher Party Committee was not firm and effective enough. In the township and commune organizations of this county, there are also phenomena of decentralism, acting one way in public and another in private, complacency and slackness, and even in some grassroots organizations, the question of the two roads has not been resolved. Precisely because of this, different results from Haiyan County have appeared in production. The experiences of these two counties and other counties have repeatedly proved that the harvest of production is the result of the harvest of ideology. Neglecting political and ideological work will inevitably affect the leap forward in production.

The meeting emphasized the need to closely combine revolutionary enthusiasm with the mass line. The meeting held that Chongde County and Tongxiang County leading the masses to carry out sustained mass revolutionary competition movements is a very good working method of the mass line. In the competition carried out by these two counties, every township, every commune, and every team had opposing sides, and even developed into competition between fields and fields. The masses exchanged information, learned from each other, learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, and strived to be upstream in the competition, truly forming a revolutionary upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced. This revolutionary competition is an important reason for promoting the vigorous work of these two counties and achieving a high yield of early rice. The meeting criticized the phenomenon of formal hooking up and competition but actually peaceful coexistence in Pinghu and Jiashan counties. It called on all counties, all districts, townships, and communes to follow the practices of Chongde and Tongxiang, deeply mobilize the masses to carry out revolutionary competition, and combine the annual competition with seasonal competition, comprehensive competition, and individual competition. At the same time, it required Chongde County and Tongxiang County to further deepen the competition and first set up a mass competition model in the struggle of breaking through the four barriers (drought resistance, fertilizer, pest and disease control, lodging) in late rice. The meeting held that, in addition to mass competition movements, other working methods of the mass line should also be adhered to and promoted.

After the end of this meeting, the counties are closely following up with the convening of enlarged meetings of the County Party Committee and three-level cadre meetings to conduct rectification.

    嘉兴地委扩大会议用事实证明
    只有思想丰收　才有生产丰收
    “铁海盐”重视思想工作，条件虽差成了千斤县
    “金平湖”忽视思想工作，条件虽好生产落了后
    据浙江日报消息：中共浙江嘉兴地委会，根据早稻丰收后的新情况，及时召开了地委扩大会议，进行整风。这次整风会议以设置对立面的方法，采用摆产量、比高低、找原因的办法，总结了海盐、海宁、崇德、桐乡四个县早稻大丰收的领导经验，检查了平湖、嘉善、长兴三个县半年来工作跃进较慢、产量较低的原因，通过总结检查，得出经验教训，找到争取晚稻和晚秋作物更大丰收的具体道路。
    今年，嘉兴地区的早稻获得了丰收。总产量预计可以超过十六亿斤，亩产量平均在七百斤左右。但是，这一产量是不平衡的。据8月5日统计，海宁县早稻的平均单位产量是一千零三十七斤，海盐县是一千零十八斤，崇德县是一千零五斤，桐乡县是九百一十三斤，平湖县、嘉善县是六百斤左右，长兴县是五百四十七斤。在嘉兴专区，一向有“金平湖、银嘉善、铁海盐”的称呼，平湖和嘉善的生产条件要比海盐优越，但是，今年海盐县的早稻产量却比平湖、嘉善两县高得多；长兴县和安吉县连界，生产条件比安吉好，但是早稻产量却比安吉低（安吉的早稻单位产量是五百八十斤）。这个对比事实不能不引起人们的注意。为什么生产条件比较差的产量反而比较高，而生产条件比较好的产量反而比较低呢？显然，不能从客观条件上去找原因，只能从主观上去找原因。
    在会上，海盐、平湖等七个县的负责同志和其他各县负责同志的发言一致认为，上半年的工作中最主要的一条经验教训是：哪里抓住以整风为纲，坚持使政治思想工作在一切工作中挂帅，哪里的工作就会出现生气勃勃不断跃进的局面。反之，凡是忽视整风、忽视政治思想工作的地方，整个工作也就表现为生气不足，跃进缓慢，生产的成绩不够显著。海盐县和平湖县就是明显的对比。今年春天，海盐县委首先在县委内部抓紧整风，不断地以群众中出现的先进事例为教材，在县委内部反复地开展反对右倾保守思想的斗争，同时严肃地批判了县委内部的分散主义和个人主义，保证了县委思想统一，力量集中，破除了各种右倾保守思想，大胆领导群众搞千担肥、搞农具改革运动，大抓田间管理，因而取得千斤县的巨大成绩。在这个县的乡社基层组织中，也坚持通过整风整顿干部思想作风，整顿组织，插红旗，拔白旗。例如官塘乡原来是一个三类乡，连年减产闹事，通过整风撤换了四十多个有严重资本主义思想或者不称职的乡、社干部，发动群众鸣放辩论，所有乡社干部都种试验田，县委的指示一般都是通宵贯彻，在最困难的地方总有干部带头苦干，因此，这个乡今年成为千斤乡。平湖县产量较低的主要原因是县委内部整风不彻底，部分成员暮气沉沉，劲头不大，对学先进赶先进缺乏应有的热情，执行上级党委的指示也不够坚决有力。在这个县的乡社组织中，也存在分散主义、阳奉阴违、自满松懈的现象，甚至在部分基层组织中，两条道路的问题还没有解决。正因为如此，在生产上也就出现了和海盐县不同的结果。这两个县以及其他各县的经验都反复地证明了：生产的丰收是思想丰收的结果，忽视政治思想工作，必然影响生产的跃进。
    会议强调要使革命干劲和群众路线密切结合起来。会议认为崇德县和桐乡县领导群众持久地开展群众性的革命竞赛运动，是一种很好的群众路线的工作方法。这两个县在开展竞赛中，乡乡、社社、队队有对立面，甚至发展为田与田间的竞赛。群众在竞赛中互通情报、互相学习，取长补短、力争上游，真正形成了学先进、赶先进、超先进的革命热潮，而这种革命竞赛是促使这两个县工作生气勃勃，取得早稻高额丰收的重要原因。会议批判了平湖、嘉善两县在形式上挂钩竞赛，实际上和平相处的现象。号召所有的县，所有的区、乡、社都效法崇德和桐乡的做法，深入发动群众开展革命竞赛，使全年竞赛和季节竞赛、综合性竞赛和单项竞赛结合起来。同时要求崇德县和桐乡县把竞赛再深入推进一步，首先在晚稻破四关（抗旱、肥料、病虫害、倒伏）的斗争中树立群众性竞赛的榜样。会议认为，除了群众性的竞赛运动以外，其他的群众路线的工作方法，也应坚持推行。
    在这次会议结束以后，各县正紧接着召开县委扩大会议和三级干部大会进行整风。
