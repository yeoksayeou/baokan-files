　　Using the experience of the Great Leap Forward to promote an even Greater Leap Forward
    Shanxi carries out the "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign
    (Our Taiyuan dispatch, August 20th) Our reporter Feng Jianwei, commenting on the "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign carried out in the rural areas of Shanxi Province, said: Since the summer harvest, the rural areas of Shanxi Province have launched a "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign, applying the successful experience of obtaining a bumper harvest in the later-stage processing and management of wheat to the management of autumn fields. This has powerfully broken the shackles of conservative and wait-and-see thinking and the technical conventions of previous years, mobilized the masses ideologically, and boosted people's morale, making the management of autumn fields outstanding.
    Everyone knows that a bumper summer harvest is a good thing, but people have different views and attitudes towards this good thing. Some believe that although the summer harvest has brought great achievements and much experience, there are also shortcomings and lessons in the work; thus, in addition to celebrating, they promptly summarize the experiences and lessons of the summer harvest and conscientiously apply them to the management of autumn fields, so that the management of autumn fields reaches the level required for a leap forward. Others believe that one season's summer harvest is equivalent to two seasons, and they won't starve even if they don't move, indulging in past victories and not seeking progress. Coupled with the influence of "settled outcome theory," "outdated theory," and "condition theory," they naturally relaxed the management of autumn fields. Weeding and hoeing were insufficient, and fertilization and irrigation were not diligent enough, and at one time some autumn fields showed a phenomenon of grass and seedlings growing together. The leading organs at all levels in Shanxi Province firmly promoted the former understanding and attitude and waged unremitting struggles against the latter, and launched the "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign in the management of autumn fields.
    The specific content of the "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign mainly includes four aspects: First, extensively publicize the achievements and reasons for wheat production through various meetings. Second, on the basis of improved ideological understanding, earnestly summarize the specific experiences and lessons of wheat production and study methods for applying them to autumn field management. In this way, the high tide of production rises wave upon wave, with the front wave pushing the back wave, circulating repeatedly, so as to achieve a bumper harvest for the whole year. Third, hold on-site meetings to spread advanced experiences, go deep into the fields to inspect and discover difficulties and shortcomings, and then sit and force change, setting a time limit for changing backward phenomena. The province organized a total of 100,000 strong leading cadres and more than 4.5 million general cadres to go deep into the fields to inspect and supervise. The inspection teams should run two counties in one month, run one-half of the townships and communes in each county, and run one-quarter of the fields in each commune. The inspection team will not leave the fields until the crops are transformed. Fourth, according to the spirit of cultivating wheat, various places have organized several battle-like shock movements according to local needs and possibilities. The largest one was to break the old convention of "hanging up the hoe after the Autumn Begins" and put forward the slogan "Add more effort after the Autumn Begins." Another battle assault was the recent processing and management of late autumn crops.
    The "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign was proposed at the rural work conference convened by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in early July, and it has been more than fifty days now. In this short period, significant achievements have been made. This fact tells us that the "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign is a good experience. Its outstanding role is to use historical facts to powerfully defeat conservative and wait-and-see thinking, encourage advanced things, and make the leap forward in autumn field management even greater.
    The special role of the "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign also lies in the fact that it applies the experience summarized from practice and persists in it in practice; it is a method of leadership using the mass line to promote a great leap forward in production, using the facts and experiences of the Great Leap Forward. Moreover, it can closely integrate ideological education work with the leap forward in production, so that ideological work and the leap forward in production play a mutually supervising and restricting role. Therefore, constantly seizing the facts of the Great Leap Forward at the time and place to defeat conservatives and onlookers and promote the continuous leap forward in production has become a successful experience explored by various parts of Shanxi. The "Promote Autumn with Summer" campaign is the specific embodiment and institutionalization of this experience. It is a good form of combining ideological struggle and production leap forward and achieving a double leap forward in ideology and production.

### 用跃进的经验推动更大的跃进  山西开展“以夏促秋”运动

　　用跃进的经验推动更大的跃进
    山西开展“以夏促秋”运动
    本报太原20日电  记者冯建韦评述山西省农村开展的“以夏促秋”运动称：夏收以来，山西省农村开展了一个“以夏促秋”运动，把小麦后期加工管理取得丰收的成功经验，具体运用到秋田管理中来，有力的打破了保守、观潮思想束缚和历年来的技术常规，从思想上发动了群众，鼓足人们的干劲，使秋田管理工作非常出色。
    谁都知道，夏季丰收是件好事，但人们对待这件好事却有不同的看法和态度。一种认为夏季丰收虽然成绩大，经验多，但也有工作上的缺点和教训；这样，他们在欢庆之余，及时总结了夏收中的经验教训，认真地运用到秋田管理中来，使秋田管理达到跃进要求的程度。另一种则认为夏收一季顶两季，不动弹也饿不着，沉醉于过去的胜利中不求前进。加上感染了“定局论”、“过时论”和“条件论”的思想影响，便自然而然地放松了秋田管理。锄铲不到，肥水不勤，部分秋田一度出现草苗齐长的现象。山西省各级领导机关坚定地对前一种认识和态度大大发扬推广，对后一种则进行不懈的斗争，并且在秋田管理工作中开展了“以夏促秋”运动。
    “以夏促秋”运动的具体内容，主要有四个方面：第一，通过各种会议广泛宣传小麦丰产成绩和原因。第二，在思想认识提高的基础上，认真总结小麦丰产的具体经验教训，研究运用到秋田管理中来的方法。这样，生产高潮一浪接一浪，前浪推后浪，循环往复，以至取得全年的大丰收。第三，召开现场会议传播先进经验，深入地头检查发现困难和缺点，然后坐镇逼迫，限期改变落后现象。全省共组织十万坚强领导骨干，四百五十多万一般干部，深入田间检查督促。检查组在一月内要跑两个县，每个县跑二分之一的乡和社，每社跑四分之一的田地，作物不转变，检查组不离田。第四，根据培植小麦的精神，各地都按着当地需要和可能组织几次战役性的突击运动。规模最大的一次是打破历年来“立了秋挂锄头”的陈规，提出“立了秋更加油”的口号。另一次战役突击是最近加工管理晚秋作物。
    “以夏促秋”运动，是7月初中共山西省委召开的农村工作会议上提出来的，到现在已经有五十多天了。在这个短短的时期里，获得重大成就。这件事实告诉我们，“以夏促秋”运动是个好经验，它的突出作用是用历史事实有力地击破保守，观潮思想，鼓励先进事物，使秋田管理跃进再跃进。
    “以夏促秋”运动的特殊作用还在于它是运用从实际中总结的经验，又到实际中坚持下去；是用大跃进的事实和经验，推动生产大跃进的群众路线的领导方法。而且还能把思想教育工作和生产跃进紧密地结合起来，使思想工作和生产跃进起互相督促和制约的作用。因此，不断地抓住当时当地大跃进的事实击败保守派和观潮派，推动生产不断跃进，这已是山西各地摸索到的一条成功经验，而“以夏促秋”运动就是这种经验的具体体现和制度化，就是使思想斗争和生产跃进相结合，并且取得思想生产双跃进的良好的形式。
