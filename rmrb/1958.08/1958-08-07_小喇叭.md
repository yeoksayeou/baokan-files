    Little trumpet, truly good, knows all the important events in the world;
    Little trumpet, truly wonderful, knows about wind and rain in advance;
    Little trumpet, extremely wonderful, listens to songs and operas without buying tickets.
    This is a folk rhyme composed by farmers for radio loudspeakers in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, where radio networks have been popularized.

    小喇叭
    小喇叭，真正好，天下大事全知晓；
    小喇叭，真正妙，刮风下雨先知道；
    小喇叭，妙极了，听歌听戏不买票。
    黑龙江省桦川县已普及广播网，这是农民给广播扩音器编的一首顺口溜。
