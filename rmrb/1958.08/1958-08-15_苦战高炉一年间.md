A Year of Hard Struggle at the Blast Furnace
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

	Studying Diligently and Practicing Hard for Quality
Before the construction of the blast furnace even began, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation’s General Party Committee put forward the slogan: "The blast furnace project must be built well, and the nation's lifeline must be deeply rooted!" It educated all employees to ensure the quality of this world-class large blast furnace. Take the welding work for example. This blast furnace is made of more than one hundred steel plates, each several tens of millimeters thick, welded into a single unit. It requires welders to not only be able to flat weld, but also to vertical weld and overhead weld, and to be able to weld anywhere. It requires that after the steel plates are welded, they are inspected by radiography, and no air holes, slag inclusions, or sand inclusions are allowed in the weld seams. There are only about ten blast furnace welders in the entire country who can meet these requirements, and they cannot be transferred. The General Corporation decided to concentrate its own welders for rigorous training.

To meet these requirements, sixth-grade technician Li Huanbo also used various methods to train himself. In July of last year, on days when just sitting still in Wuhan would cause sweat to pour out, everyone was sitting in the work shed practicing various welding methods, but he deliberately placed the welding pieces in awkward positions, twisting his waist and lowering his head to weld. He also placed a steel plate on four short sticks, so that he couldn't reach the weld joint from any side, and he would stretch his body under the steel plate to weld while lying down. When he finished welding, his clothes were soaked in sweat. The team leader couldn't help but laugh at him, saying, "Why don't you do the easy work and insist on doing the hard work?" He replied with a clear conscience, "If I can weld the difficult ones well, I can guarantee the quality of the easy ones."

	Fighting in Water and Fire
Li Huanbo and his team were first assigned to weld the first ring of the furnace shell onto the foundation support. This ring of steel plate was thirty-seven or eight meters long and had to be welded for a long time. However, to ensure the quality of the weld, they were required to weld it all at once. That day, they worked an early shift and then came to weld again. Who knew that it would start raining heavily soon after they started welding? There was no rain shelter on the construction site, and they weren't wearing raincoats or rain boots. At this time, even though the company's Party Committee Secretary and Manager were so anxious that they personally put up scaffolding and covered it with tarpaulins, they couldn't stop the rain. Li Huanbo and his team used their bodies to cover the weld joint and welded in the rain.

At night, there were three more heavy rains, which flooded their feet with water from the foundation. The manager, fearing that the rain water would cause electrocution, asked them to stop. But Deputy Team Leader Li Huanbo and everyone else proposed: "We won't stop until we finish welding!" The rain water caused his hands to become numb and unable to hold the welding torch steadily, so he switched to the other hand to weld. He persisted in welding in the rain. At this time, Zhang Haoliang's eyes were blurred by the strong arc light, and he couldn't see anything clearly. Wang Zhihai couldn't hold on in the rain because he was weak. He and Team Leader Shi Jiexin took on their work and worked for twenty-one hours straight.

Welding the nineteenth and twentieth rings of the furnace shell, they had to weld forty-millimeter-thick steel plates onto twenty-five-millimeter-thin steel plates, which was very difficult to weld. The furnace breast platform blocked the weld joint, and they couldn't see it from the outside. If they couldn't see it from above, they would hook their heads down to weld from the gaps on the side of the platform. If they couldn't see it from below, they would crawl into the gaps to weld. Because they were too close to the weld joint, Li Huanbo's clothes on his chest were scorched by the welding fire, and many welding sparks were flying directly into his neck, and there was nowhere to hide. The fiery red slag stuck to his skin as soon as it touched it and wouldn't fall off. He shook his body, trying to shake off the slag, but the slag slid straight down his back, some even sliding down to his heels. No matter how painful it was, he didn't withdraw his hand, and he insisted on welding one welding rod at a time to ensure the quality and speed of the welding. They withstood it for a day and finished welding this ring of weld seams. When he returned to the work shed and took off his clothes, he saw that his neck and arms were covered with many blisters burned by the slag, and his back was burned all the way to his right heel, so he couldn't even lie down. Team Leader Shi Jiexin even had a small hole burned in his foot, and he limped when he walked. But they achieved excellent quality.

	Tapping Iron Early to Catch Up with Britain
After the furnace breast was welded, the construction site reorganized the teams, and Li Huanbo's team was left with only six people. As soon as their team was reorganized, they discussed how to respond to the Party's call, guarantee that No. 1 blast furnace would tap iron early on October 1st, and enable the national steel production to catch up with Britain ahead of schedule. They also formulated a "four do" leap forward plan: "Go wherever it is difficult; do whatever is needed; do what others don't do; and do what doesn't reach the quota."

At this time, seven sections of the large hot air duct with a diameter of two meters had been installed, waiting for the seams inside to be welded so that they could be delivered immediately. But the ventilation equipment hadn't been bought, and the ventilation inside the duct was poor, so the safety department wouldn't allow them to work. Li Huanbo and his team held a team meeting and decided: "Let's do it first and then talk about it." They didn't wait for the team to issue a work order and crawled into the duct from the "manhole."

May in Wuhan is already very hot. The duct wall of the hot air duct is not thick, and after being exposed to the sun, plus the burning of several welding fires, it was so hot inside the duct that people couldn't breathe. The ventilation inside the duct was poor, and the toxic welding fumes filled the inside, making people choke. The wind shovels that were leveling the weld roots were also started up, making the inside even dustier and smokier. Li Huanbo welded inside for more than an hour and couldn't stand it anymore, so he quickly called everyone out to get some air. When they came out and looked at each other, they couldn't help but laugh. Everyone's face was black except for their eyes, and their clothes were soaked in sweat. But after resting for a while, they went back in and continued welding.

They were working intensely inside, but who knew that the chief of the General Corporation's safety department came to tell them to stop work immediately. They said that it was important to guarantee that iron would be tapped on October 1st, but the chief of the safety department said: "You can't work if the ventilation equipment hasn't arrived. If someone gets electrocuted inside from sweating or passes out from the heat, who will be responsible?" Li Huanbo saw that he couldn't explain it to him, so he called everyone to crawl out and said, "Okay, we won't do it." As soon as the chief of the safety department turned his back, they crawled back in and continued working. The chief of the safety department went around the construction site and heard noises inside, so he immediately came to interfere again: "You can't do it!" They said: "We'll finish this little bit and then we won't do it." As soon as he left, they continued to do it as before.

After they finished welding these seven sections of duct, what were they going to do next? Li Huanbo went to the team leader to ask for tasks. The team leader said: "Then you can weld the hot air duct, the quota is four workers to weld one seam." Li Huanbo laughed as soon as he heard this and immediately said: "Four workers are too many, half a worker is enough." Half a worker can weld a circle of large duct? The team leader was taken aback and asked him what was going on. He replied: "We finished it long ago."

They are a "Communist Team"
A year of hard struggle has made Li Huanbo thinner and taller. The safety officer asked him to go to the hospital for a physical examination to get a new certificate of qualification. He knew that he had high blood pressure and was afraid that the doctor wouldn't let him do high-altitude work again, so he didn't dare to go. Every time the safety officer asked him if he had gone for the examination, he always lied with a smile: "Hey, I forgot again. The certificate of qualification is in the work shed, I didn't bring it."

They were currently welding the large funnel of the material bin. The quota was eight meters welded per worker, and Li Huanbo and his team worked ten or so hours a day, doubling the quota.

At noon on June 23rd, Li Huanbo was welding the funnel intently when he felt a headache, thirst, and discomfort all over his body. He climbed down the scaffolding, stepped over the planks, went to the stairs to drink a glass of water, and then went back to weld, but he was thirsty again immediately. He thought: Going up and down wastes time, I'll finish welding this section and then go drink. He welded six or seven welding rods in a row, and then he felt nauseous, spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva, and felt dizzy, blurred vision, and couldn't see anything clearly. Fearing that he would fall from a high place, he quickly put the welding torch and welding rod on the plank and slid down while grabbing a long bamboo pole.

As soon as he left the hospital, he wanted to return to the construction site to work. The branch secretary wouldn't let him go, but he still wanted to go, and the branch secretary was so anxious that he stipulated: "Now you have to take care of your health for better work in the future." He couldn't go to the construction site, but he wasn't idle either. He held a meeting with all the comrades in the team at night, believing that exceeding the quota by 20% was normal, but they had exceeded the quota by one time this time, because the quota was unreasonable, and they shouldn't receive unreasonable excess wages. Their team returned more than 130 yuan of excess wages to the state in June, of which Li Huanbo alone returned more than 40 yuan.

The Hubei Provincial Party Committee Industrial Inspection Group came to the construction site, and the branch secretary reported to them on the situation of Li Huanbo's team's year of hard struggle at the blast furnace site. Wang Renzhong, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said at the time: "This is a Communist team. A red flag should be planted on this team." The Metal Structure Company Party, government, labor union, and youth league presented them with a red flag, on which was written:

"Oppose conservatism, have great enthusiasm, and the Communist ideology has blossomed!" (Attached picture)

    苦战高炉一年间
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    勤学苦练为质量
    高炉还没动工，武钢总党委就提出口号：“高炉工程要建好，国家命根要扎深！”教育全体职工必须保证这座世界第一流的大型高炉的质量。以电焊工作来讲，这座高炉是由一百多块几十公厘厚的钢板焊成一个整体的，它要求电焊工不仅会平焊，而且会立焊、仰焊，在任何地方都能焊接；它要求钢板焊好后，用透视的方法检验，不允许焊缝里有半点气孔和夹渣夹砂。能达到这样要求的高炉电焊工，全国也只有十来个，又调不来。总公司才决定将自己的电焊工集中起来严格训练。
    为了达到这样的要求，六级技工厉焕波还用各种方法来训练自己。去年7月，在武汉静坐着也会直淌汗的日子，大家都在工棚里坐着练习各种焊接方法，而他却故意把焊件摆的很不得劲，扭着腰低着头去焊接。他还把一块钢板安在四根矮棍上，从哪边伸手也够不着焊口，他就将身子探进钢板底下去躺着焊。等焊完起来，他的衣服都被汗水湿透了。队长见他这模样，都忍不住笑着说他：“好干的不干，偏弄成不好干的来干。”他却理直气壮地回答说：“能把这不好焊的焊好，好焊的就能保证质量了。”
      在水火中搏斗
    厉焕波他们初次上阵，就负责将第一圈炉壳焊在基础托脚上。这圈钢板有三十七、八公尺长，得焊好些时。但是为了保证焊缝质量，却要他们一次焊完。那天，他们干了一个早班，接着又来焊。谁知焊了不久，雨就哗哗地下了，工地上没雨棚，他们也没穿雨衣雨鞋。这时尽管急的公司党委书记、经理都亲自搭跳板、盖雨布，也挡不住雨，厉焕波他们就用身子遮住焊口，在雨中焊接。
    夜里，又连下三场大雨，下的他们脚背也被基础里的积水淹没。经理怕雨水过电电死人，要他们停下来。可是副组长厉焕波和大家一起提出：“不焊完不收兵！”过电的雨水，使他的手麻的掌不稳电焊把了，他就换一只手焊。始终坚持在雨中焊接。这时，张灏良被强烈的电弧光射花了眼，什么都看不清。王志海因为身体弱，在雨中坚持不住了。他和组长施界新就把他们的工作担负起来，一连干了二十一个钟头。
    焊接第十九圈和二十圈炉壳，要将四十公厘的厚钢板焊在二十五公厘的薄钢板上，非常难焊，而炉胸平台恰好挡住了这道焊口，外面看不见。上面看不见，他们就从平台边的缝隙里勾下头去焊。在下面看不见，他们就连身子一起钻进缝隙里去焊。因为离焊口太近，厉焕波胸部的衣服都给焊火烤糊了，许多电焊火渣还直往他的脖子里钻，躲也没处躲。火红的铁渣一挨着皮肤就粘住不掉下来，他抖动一下，想把火渣抖掉，哪知火渣又从背上直往下溜，有的竟溜到脚跟上了。他怎么痛也不缩手，硬坚持着一气焊完一根焊条，保证焊接的质量和速度。他们就这样硬抗了一天，将这圈焊缝焊完了。他回工棚脱开衣服一看，脖子、手臂都给火渣烧的斑斑点点好些火泡，他的背上也被火渣烧了一溜，直烧到右脚跟上，躺都不能躺。组长施界新脚上还烧了个小洞，走路都一跛一跛的。但他们却使质量达到了优等。
    提前出铁赶英国
    炉胸焊完后，工地重划小组，厉焕波这个组只剩下六个人。他们小组刚分完，就讨论怎样响应党的号召，保证一号高炉提前在10月1日出铁，使全国钢铁产量提前赶上英国。他们还订出了“四干”跃进规划：“哪里艰苦哪里干；啥时需要啥时干；别人不干的自己干；达不到定额的也自己干。”
    这时，两公尺直径的大热风围管已安装了七节，就等着将里面的缝子焊好，马上交工。但通风设备没买到，管内通风不良，安全处不让干。厉焕波他们开了个小组会，决定：“咱们干了再说。”他们不等队里下工程任务单，就从“人孔”钻进管里去了。
    武汉的5月天已经很热，管壁不厚的围管经太阳一晒，加上几盘电焊火的燃烧，管子里面真热的人喘不过气来。管里通风不好，有毒的焊火烟在里面弥漫，直呛人，而铲平焊根的风铲也开动起来，更搞的里面灰尘四起，烟雾腾腾。厉焕波在里面焊了一个多小时，实在支持不住了，连忙招呼大家出来换换气。他们出来互相一瞧，都忍不住笑了起来。他们每个人除了眼睛以外，连脸都是黑的，浑身的衣服都汗透了。但他们歇了一会，又进去继续焊接了。
    他们在里面干的正紧张，那知道总公司的安全处长却来叫他们马上停工。他们说保证10月1日出铁要紧，安全处长却说：“通风设备没来不能干。万一要在里面出汗过电电死了人，或者热晕倒了，谁敢负责？”厉焕波看跟他说不清楚，就招呼大伙儿钻出来，说：“好，不干了。”安全处长一转背，他们又钻了进去继续干。安全处长在工地上转了一圈回来，听见里面还有响动，马上又来干涉：“不能干呀！”他们说：“干完这点就不干了。”等他一走，他们又照样干。
    他们焊完了这七节围管，再干什么呢？厉焕波去找队长要任务。队长说：“那你们干热风围管吧，定额是四个工焊一道缝。”厉焕波一听这话就乐了，马上说：“四个工太多，半个工就行了。”半个工能焊完一圈大围管？队长大吃一惊，追问他是怎么回事，他才回答说：“我们早干完了。”
  他们是“共产主义小组”
    一年的苦战，使厉焕波变得更瘦更长了。安全员要他去医院检查身体，换取新的合格证。他知道自己血压高，怕医生不让他再干高空作业，不敢去。安全员每次问他去检查没有，他总是嘻皮笑脸地扯谎说：“嗨，又忘了。合格证放在工棚里，没带来。”
    他们这时正焊料仓的大漏斗。定额是一工焊八公尺，厉焕波他们一天干十来小时，比定额翻了一番。
    6月23日中午，厉焕波正在紧张地焊这漏斗，就感到头痛口渴，浑身难受。他攀下支架，跨过跳板，到楼梯上喝了一杯水，又去焊，但马上又渴了。他想：一上一下耽误时间，焊完这段再去喝。他接连焊了六七根焊条，心里又打呕，吐出一口带血的唾沫来，并且头晕，眼花，什么也看不清。他怕从高处摔下地，便连忙将焊把焊条放在跳板上，抓住一根长竹竿滑了下来。
    他刚出医院，就要回工地工作。支部书记不让他去，他还要去，急的支部书记规定：“现在你得把身体养好，为了今后更好的工作。”他不能上工地去，但他也不闲着，他晚上和全组同志开了个会，认为超过定额20％才正常，而他们这次却超过定额一倍，是因为定额不合理，他们不应该领取不合理的超额工资。他们小组6月份就退还国家一百三十多元超额工资，其中光是厉焕波一人就退还了四十多元。
    湖北省委工业检查团来到工地，支部书记向他们汇报了厉焕波这个小组在高炉工地苦战一年的情况，省委第一书记王任重当时就说：“这是个共产主义小组。要在这个小组插上红旗。”金属结构公司党政工团送给他们一面红旗，上边写的是：
    “反保守，干劲大，共产主义思想开了花！”（附图片）
