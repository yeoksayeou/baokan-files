Beware of America's Tricks
    Ma Ai

Comrade Khrushchev saw through the trick of the United States and Britain to use the Security Council to undermine the summit conference of great powers. In order to take necessary measures to stop aggression as soon as possible, he proposed convening an emergency session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan. This is a just and upright proposal, aimed at "finding a way to eliminate the military danger created by the activities of the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East, and to bring peace to the region." Any person with conscience, who can say no to such a fair and aboveboard proposal!

However, the American aggressors shamelessly played new tricks.

Dulles, in order to play the hero in front of his lackeys (and of course, to deal with world public opinion), said that the United States was "not hesitant" to hold such a conference, but immediately added that "the United States believes that these issues should first be discussed in the Security Council." If it is "not hesitant," why "first discuss in the Security Council"? Dulles's remarks show that the United States is determined to serve up its poison to kill peaceful suggestions.

Eisenhower declared that he "welcomes" submitting the issue to the United Nations. He no longer harps on the stale tune of a special meeting of the Security Council; this is a change of "soup," but he immediately indicated that this conference should be convened according to "American conditions." The old medicine is brought out again.

What are the "American conditions"? It is said that the conference should give priority to discussing "American proposals."

What is the content of the American proposal? It is said to be about the issue of "indirect aggression" by the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic. Leaving aside the direct aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan, they want to "prioritize" discussing "indirect aggression," something colorless, shapeless, and no one knows what it is. This is the question that the shameless president has raised to the people of the world.

Regarding "indirect aggression," according to the US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, this is "we are facing a major and cruel fact, that is, the fact of inciting civil war through assassins in plain clothes, rather than soldiers in uniform." What a "major and cruel" "assassin in plain clothes"! He not only wants to assassinate, but also to "incite civil war." Then, who is he? What does he look like? Can you point him out and let us see? The United States and Britain, sending six or seven thousand troops, deploying planes, warships, tanks, and artillery, and even dispatching atomic forces, is it just to capture or defend against such an "assassin in plain clothes"! Isn't this broad daylight nonsense? Who can be fooled? Six or seven thousand troops, all kinds of weapons, are evidence of the direct aggression of the United States and Britain. This is obvious to all, and seen by the world; but where is the evidence of that "indirect aggression"? Can the nonsense and lies of robbers and hooligans be treated as issues for discussion?

There are "plain clothes," but I don't know if they are "assassins." According to newspaper reports: "Currently, 850 American soldiers in plain clothes have arrived in Iran, and they will be used to implement plans against the Iraqi government." This is also part of "direct aggression," and when the withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East is discussed, this can be discussed together.

The United Press International reporter is smugly promoting their president's new trick. "The president's actions are faster than ever before." In the eyes of this reporter, the president's talent for playing rogue has greatly improved. In our opinion, he has always been so shameless, and there is nothing strange about it. The UPI reporter also happily said that it seems that the American proposal may win a majority of seven votes in the Security Council and be sent to the United Nations General Assembly for "priority" discussion. Whether it can obtain such a majority is another question, but one thing is certain: Eisenhower's trick will eventually fail, because it is a trick and can never be brought into the sunlight.

    谨防美国的鬼把戏
    马艾
    赫鲁晓夫同志识破了美国和英国想利用安理会破坏大国首脑会议的鬼把戏，为了尽快地采取制止侵略的必要措施，提出了召开联大紧急会议，来讨论美国军队从黎巴嫩、英国军队从约旦撤退的问题。这是堂堂正正的主张，目的在于“找出一条道路来消除由于美英的活动而在中近东造成的军事危险，并且使这个地区得到安宁”。有人心的人，谁能对这种光明正大的主张说一个不字！
    但是，美国侵略者仍然无耻地耍出了新的鬼把戏。
    杜勒斯为了在自己的奴才们面前充好汉（当然也是为了应付世界舆论），说美国对于开这样一个大会“并不踌蹰”，但紧接着又说“美国认为这些问题首先应该在安理会中讨论”。既然“并不踌蹰”，为什么又要“首先在安理会中讨论”呢？杜勒斯的这一番话，说明美国决心端出它的毒药，来杀害和平的建议。
    艾森豪威尔宣称“欢迎”把问题提交联合国。他不再弹安全理事会特别会议的滥调了，这是换了“汤”；但是他紧接着就表示，这个大会要根据“美国的条件”召开。旧药就又拿出来了。
    什么是“美国的条件呢”？据说就是要大会优先讨论“美国的提案”。
    美国的提案又是什么内容呢？据说就是关于苏联和阿联“间接侵略”的问题。放着美国和英国对于黎巴嫩和约旦的直接侵略不讨论，却要“优先”去讨论无色无形谁也不知道是什么东西的“间接侵略”，这就是那位厚颜无耻的总统先生向世界人民提出来的问题。
    关于“间接侵略”，据美国驻联合国代表洛奇说，这就是“我们面临着重大而残酷的事实，就是通过穿便衣的刺客，而不是穿制服的军人来煽动内战的事实。”好一个“重大而残酷”的“便衣刺客”！他不仅要行刺，还要“煽动内战”。那末，他是谁？什么样子？能不能指出来看看？美国和英国，派六、七万大兵，开动飞机、军舰、坦克、大炮，还出动了原子部队，难道就是为了捉拿或者是防卫这样的“便衣刺客”！这岂不正是光天化日之下说鬼话。骗得了谁？六、七万军队，各式各样的武器，便是美国和英国直接侵略的证据，这是众目昭彰，举世皆见的；然而那“间接侵略”的证据又在哪里呢？难道强盗和流氓们的胡说和鬼话也可以当作问题来讨论吗？
    “便衣”是有的，但不知他们是不是“刺客”。据报纸报道：“目前已有八百五十名美国军人穿着便服到达伊朗，他们将被用来实现反对伊拉克政府的计划”。这也是“直接侵略”的一部分，当讨论到美英军队从中东撤退的时候，这倒是可以一并加以讨论的。
    合众国际社的记者正在得意忘形地替他们总统的新把戏捧场，“总统行动之快几乎是前所未有的”，在这位记者看来总统撒赖的才智是大有长进的了，在我们看来，他却是一贯如此不知耻，并没有什么可奇怪的。合众国际社的记者还高兴地说，看来美国提案可能在安理会争得七票的多数，被送到联合国大会上“优先”讨论的。能不能获得这样的多数是另一问题，但有一点是肯定的，艾森豪威尔的鬼把戏最终一定是破产，原因它是一种鬼把戏，永远拉不到太阳光下来的。
