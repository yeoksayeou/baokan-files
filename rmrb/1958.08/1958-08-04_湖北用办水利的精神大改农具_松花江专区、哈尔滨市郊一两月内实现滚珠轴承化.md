Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd. Hubei Province will basically achieve agricultural semi-mechanization this winter and next spring. This was proposed and decided by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at a telephone conference of the first secretaries of local and municipal committees on July 31.

At this telephone conference, the Provincial Party Committee required all localities to immediately take measures to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on rapidly launching a farm tool improvement campaign in rural areas. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this year's farm tool improvement campaign must be like the water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, with secretaries taking the lead and the entire party mobilizing, forming a large-scale mass movement throughout the province. Taking the General Line as the key, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and give play to the spirit of creation through methods such as calculating labor accounts, on-site visits, and exhibitions of advanced farm tools. At the same time, relevant work departments, factories, and handicraft cooperatives should be mobilized to divide labor and cooperate, and actively serve the farm tool improvement campaign. It is required that this winter and next spring, improved and new farm tools be adopted in four aspects: field operation tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, seeders, and cultivators; processing tools such as threshing, rice milling, and flour milling machines; water lifting tools; and transportation tools, to achieve ball bearingization.

In order to strengthen leadership over the farm tool improvement campaign, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee requires that special leading bodies be established immediately from the province to the prefecture, county, township, and commune levels, and that comprehensive plans be formulated from top to bottom, specifying targets and completing them on a regular basis.

According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the Songhua River Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of July 28, attended by the county party secretaries of Zhaoyuan, Shuangcheng, Hailun, Wuchang, Bayan, Suihua, Tonghe, and Zhaozhou counties. First, Comrade Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and First Secretary of the Songhua River Prefectural Committee, conveyed the central government's instructions on rapidly achieving ball bearingization of agricultural operation tools. Then, discussions were held in accordance with the spirit of the central instructions. The meeting finally decided that secretaries should take command, rely on the masses, work hard for two months, and basically achieve ball bearingization of agricultural operation tools by the end of September.

The meeting pointed out that the reason why it is necessary to basically achieve ball bearingization of agricultural operation tools by the end of September is because the strenuous work of the busy autumn harvest, autumn plowing, transportation, and water conservancy construction will need to advance simultaneously from that time onwards. If ball bearingization is not completed, one thing will be taken care of at the expense of another, and there is even a risk of failing to meet the Great Leap Forward targets, which will inevitably affect the even greater Leap Forward next year. Therefore, it is necessary to continue the struggle between the two lines of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive, carry out debates, open up the mind, emancipate the mind, eliminate the mysterious view of ball bearings, and take rapid action on the basis of improving understanding. Secretaries should take action, rely on the masses, do everything possible, work hard and practically, and form a mass movement. It is necessary to learn while doing, and learn from fraternal regions. Zhaozhou, Zhaoyuan, Shuangcheng and other counties which have already made ball bearings by indigenous methods must expand production, spread and exchange experiences, and support and cooperate with each other.

That evening, the Central Songhua River Prefectural Committee held a telephone conference with various cities and counties within the region on this issue and made arrangements. The responsible comrades of the fifteen cities and counties participating in the meeting all expressed that they would definitely be able to achieve this task as scheduled.

Furthermore, on July 28, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting attended by the first secretaries of the directly affiliated county committees, suburban district committees, urban district committees, and responsible comrades of relevant municipal units. After conveying the central government's instructions on rapidly achieving semi-mechanization of agricultural production tools, the meeting decided that all agricultural cooperatives in the city should rapidly launch a larger-scale and more powerful upsurge of farm tool reform centered on the bearingization of agricultural operation tools. By the end of August, all agricultural cooperatives in the city should basically achieve bearingization of agricultural operation tools.

The meeting required that the first secretaries of county and district committees must personally take charge and take immediate action, submit specific plans within three days, and first complete the bearingization of rural transportation and grain processing and other operation tools.

    湖北用办水利的精神大改农具
    松花江专区、哈尔滨市郊一两月内实现滚珠轴承化
    新华社武汉2日电　湖北省全省将在今冬明春基本实现农业半机械化。这是7月31日中共湖北省委在召开各地、市委第一书记电话会议上提出和决定的。
    在这次电话会议上，省委要求各地立即采取措施，贯彻中共中央和国务院关于迅速在农村展开农具改良运动的指示。省委认为：今年的农具改良运动必须像去冬今春搞水利建设那样，做到书记动手，全党动员，在全省范围内形成大规模群众运动。要以总路线为纲，通过算劳力账，现场参观，先进农具展览等方法，充分发动群众，调动群众的革命干劲和发挥创造精神。同时，要有关的工作部门、工厂和手工业社动员起来，分工协作，积极为农具改良运动服务。要求今冬明春，在双轮双铧犁、播种器、中耕器等田间操作工具，脱粒、碾米、磨面等加工工具，提水工具和运输工具四个方面，采用改良农具和新式农具，实现滚珠轴承化。
    为了加强对农具改良运动的领导，湖北省委要求从省到专区、县、乡、社，立即建立专门的领导机构，从上到下全面制订规划，规定指标，定期完成。
    据黑龙江日报讯　中共松花江地委在7月28日下午召开了有肇源、双城、海伦、五常、巴彦、绥化、通河、肇州等八个县的县委书记参加的紧急会议，首先由省委书记兼松花江地委第一书记强晓初同志传达了中央关于迅速实现农业运转工具滚珠轴承化的指示。然后根据中央指示精神进行了讨论，会议最后决定：书记挂帅，依靠群众，大干两个月，在9月末以前基本实现农业运转工具滚珠轴承化。
    会议指出，所以要在9月末以前基本实现农业运转工具滚珠轴承化，是因为从那个时候起紧张的秋收、秋翻、运转、水利建设等项繁重工作都需要齐头并进。如果完不成滚珠轴承化，就会顾此失彼，甚至有使大跃进指标落空的危险，从而也必将影响明年的更大跃进。因此，必须继续进行多快好省与少慢差费两条路线的斗争，开展辩论，打通思想，解放思想，破除对滚珠轴承的神秘观点，在提高认识的基础上迅速的行动起来，书记动手，依靠群众，千方百计，苦干实干，形成群众运动；必须边干、边学，向兄弟地区学习。用土法已经制成滚珠轴承的肇州、肇源、双城等县必须扩大生产，传播交流经验，互相支援协作。
    当天晚上，中央松花江地委就这一问题召开了地区内各市、县的电话会议，进行了部署。参加会议的十五个市、县负责同志都表示一定能够如期实现这个任务。
    又讯　7月28日，中共哈尔滨市委召开有各直属县委、郊区区委第一书记、市区区委书记和市有关单位负责同志参加的紧急会议。会议在传达中央关于迅速实现农业生产工具半机械化的指示以后，决定全市各农业社迅速掀起一个规模更大、声势更高的以农业运转工具轴承化为中心的农具改革高潮。到8月末全市农业社要基本实现农业运转工具轴承化。
    会议要求，各县委、区委第一书记要亲自挂帅，立即行动起来，三天内提出具体规划，首先完成农村运输、粮谷加工等运转工具轴承化。
