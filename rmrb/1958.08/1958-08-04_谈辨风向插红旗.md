    On Identifying Wind Direction and Planting Red Flags
    Fang Bi

    In human social life, various winds constantly blow from all directions. Some of these winds are stirred up by one class, and some by another. They stir up these winds with the aim of making history advance along the path they desire. And the winds with different breaths blowing from all directions clash and stir against each other. When a revolutionary period arrives, a massive storm is unleashed in human history, and in the revolutionary storm, a new society is born.

    Therefore, living in a complex society filled with class struggle, people need to have the ability to identify wind direction, and they need to maintain a clear head so that when the wind blows, they can distinguish its nature and trace its origins. During the Warring States period, Song Yu, a rather famous writer of rhapsodies, distinguished between different types of winds. In an essay called "Wind Rhapsody," he divided winds into two major categories: one was the wind of the nobles, which he called the male wind, and the other was the wind of the common people, which he called the female wind. He greatly exaggerated the former type of wind, saying that it "arises from the earth, starting from the tip of the green duckweed;" that it "greens the mountains of Mount Tai and dances beneath the pines and cypresses;" that it "lingers among the cinnamon and pepper and soars above the turbulent waters." He said that this wind could cure diseases and relieve drunkenness, and that it could "sharpen the senses, bring comfort and convenience," truly wonderful. As for the latter type of wind, he described it in a completely different way. He said that this wind "rises abruptly from the poor alleys," carrying sand and dust all the way, with an unpleasant smell. He said that this wind made people feel uncomfortable all over, causing many diseases, even leaving them half-dead. Clearly, Song Yu was speaking from the standpoint of the ruling class. Therefore, contrary to him, what he praised is exactly what we detest; and what he considered lowly is, in our view, the real male wind that drives the development of human history.

    But sometimes, facing the complex class struggle, some people are blown around by the winds coming from all directions, becoming disoriented; some people suffer from a political head cold and cannot distinguish the smell of the wind when they encounter it. This situation is very dangerous. Last May, when our Party was preparing to begin the rectification campaign, the bourgeois rightists blew a counter-current wind. This wind actually wanted to push the wheels of Chinese history backward, to abolish the leadership of the Party, and to oppose socialism. In that situation, many people could not figure out the origin of this wind and suddenly did not know how to cope. Some people even blindly followed this wind for a while, only to later find that the wind direction was wrong and turn around to fight against it. Even earlier, in the second half of 1955, a wind had also blown. Under the influence of this wind, many people said that the pace of cooperativization was too fast and that the peasants did not welcome it. But Comrade Mao Zedong, a master at identifying wind direction, was not misled by it. He pointed out that this wind was only blowing from a small number of wealthy middle peasants, who were stirring up this wind only to hinder the advance of agricultural cooperativization. Comrade Mao Zedong asked us to pay attention to a very small cooperative in Hebei Province. This cooperative, under the persistence of three poor peasant households, was finally run very well. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The direction indicated by these three poor peasant households is the direction of 500 million peasants across the country." It was precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong was good at identifying wind direction and knew what the real demands of the broad masses of peasants were, that he accurately judged at that time that a high tide of socialist transformation was about to appear in China's rural areas. Now people can clearly see that Comrade Mao Zedong's words have been completely realized.

    However, the difficulty of identifying wind direction lies in those small winds that have just occurred. These tiny winds are usually not easily noticed by people. But some winds, although small at the beginning, will eventually become the overwhelming male wind on the historical stage as social life develops. To identify this kind of wind, one needs to be able to see the big from the small and needs scientific foresight. More than a hundred years ago, when the working class was still a relatively weak force, Marx and Engels saw that it would become the great class to overthrow the capitalist system and establish a socialist society. Now, as Marx and Engels predicted, the communist movement launched by the working class has flourished worldwide, and the current situation is that "the East wind prevails over the West wind." Similarly, Comrade Mao Zedong also has such a genius for scientific foresight. After the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War, the revolutionary forces were greatly weakened. At that time, some people became pessimistic. But Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in a famous article, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire": "Although there is only a small force now, its development will be very rapid." In 1930, when China was still under the dark rule of the reactionary Kuomintang, Comrade Mao Zedong predicted in this article that a revolutionary high tide would appear in China. He wrote: "...What I said about the imminent arrival of a high tide in the Chinese revolution is by no means an empty thing, 'possibly coming' in the sense of being wholly devoid of significance for action, which some people allege. It is like a ship far out at sea whose masthead can already be seen from the shore; it is like the morning sun in the east whose shimmering rays are visible from a high mountain top; it is like a child about to be born moving restlessly in its mother’s womb." Now the people's New China has long been born, the New China's ship is sailing rapidly in the socialist ocean, and the victories that the Chinese people have achieved under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong are like the sun at its zenith, dazzling.

    On the issue of identifying wind direction, the great revolutionary teachers have set an example for us more than once. As long as we examine actual life more carefully, we will find more exemplary cases in this regard.

    Clearly, identifying wind direction, especially identifying the small winds that have just occurred, is of great significance for a revolutionary leading cadre. If this wind originates from the people, then after identification, people will have more confidence and move more firmly in the correct direction. If this wind blows from the opposing side, then after identification, people will promptly extinguish it and prevent its development.

    Closely following the identification of wind direction is another important issue, which is about planting flags. In complex social life, the revolutionary and the reactionary, the advanced and the backward forces are often in a state of contradiction and struggle. As a revolutionary fighter, there is no doubt that he is not an observer, and he should not be satisfied with merely objectively pointing out the development trend of history. A strong revolutionary fighter always strives to realize the demands of the advanced class and constantly fights against the reactionary forces. When society faces tremendous changes, when the revolutionary storm arrives, he can not only identify the wind direction and see the way forward, but also always raise the people's banner, walk at the forefront of the team, and move forward against the wind stirred up by the reactionary forces. On the road forward, he will not hesitate to remove all kinds of reactionary flags he encounters and plant the flags of the advanced people.

    Wherever there are people in the world, there will be flags, either advanced revolutionary flags or reactionary backward flags. People will not see completely blank areas. Taking the situation in our country, since liberation, socialist forces and capitalist forces have undergone many fierce struggles. In the struggle, socialist forces have achieved one victory after another, so that the socialist red flag has become more and more widely planted in vast areas of the country. But at the same time, capitalist forces are always trying their best to struggle and constantly engage in activities. They have demanded "four major freedoms" and proposed "abolishing the leadership of the Party," and so on. Facts show that as long as there is an opportunity, they will raise their white flags. Although socialist forces now have an absolute advantage, the struggle between these two forces has not stopped. And, no matter where, if we do not resolutely plant the socialist red flag, then the capitalist white flag will definitely appear there. Therefore, in order to promote the development of society, the current task of the Chinese people is to plant the socialist red flag in every corner of the country and remove all backward and reactionary flags that hinder the advancement of the socialist cause.

    To plant red flags, to be an advanced flag bearer in the current era of the great leap forward in socialist construction, the most important thing is to have the communist style of daring to speak, daring to think, and daring to act, and to break the sense of inferiority that shackles people's thinking. Because only in this way can people face all kinds of so-called "authorities," plant the socialist red flag, and unhesitatingly remove one by one the white flags that are secretly planted under the fine-sounding names of experts and scholars.

    On the issue of planting red flags, we should also learn from Comrade Mao Zedong. In the revolutionary movement of the Chinese working class, whether in the period of democratic revolution or in the period of socialist revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong is forever the great and outstanding flag bearer of the Chinese people. Following the red flag he raised, the Chinese people have overcome countless obstacles and dangers, overcome many great difficulties, and advanced from victory to victory. And those reactionary flags have fallen down one after another in front of the glorious banner of Comrade Mao Zedong. Now the red flag of the general line of socialist construction raised by Comrade Mao Zedong is fluttering in the wind. Under the guidance of this huge red flag, the Chinese people are creating one miracle after another with soaring energy. At the same time, in contrast, this great banner appears so magnificent and majestic, while the flags of other opposing sides are so small and ugly.

    It should be seen that identifying wind direction and planting red flags is not only of great significance in class society, but is also necessary even after classes are eliminated. Because, at any time, people always have advanced, middle, and backward distinctions. For this reason, people should identify the advanced wind direction, raise the advanced red flag, unite the broad masses of the people, and push the wheels of history forward.

    To correctly identify wind direction and to become an advanced red flag bearer, the important thing is to arm oneself with the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism and with the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and to study materialism and dialectics well. This is indispensable for curing our political head colds and sense of inferiority. However, it must also be noted that in order to identify wind direction and plant red flags, one must deeply participate in actual struggle and maintain close contact with the people in actual struggle. Only by deeply understanding the thoughts, feelings, and demands of the people can we correctly identify wind direction; at the same time, only by standing on the side of the people, firmly believing in and relying on the people, can we become a red flag bearer who dares to speak, dares to think, dares to do, and has a noble communist style.

    谈辨风向插红旗
    方璧
    在人类的社会生活中，经常有各种各样的风从四面八方吹来，这些风有的是这一个阶级所掀起，有的是那一个阶级所掀起；他们把风掀起，目的不外是要使历史沿着自己所希望的道路前进。而从各方面吹来的气息不同的风，就相互冲突，相互激荡。当革命时期到来的时候，人类历史上就卷起了巨大的风暴，在革命的暴风雨中，新的社会也就诞生了。
    因此，处在复杂的充满着阶级斗争的社会里，人们就需要具有识别风向的能力，就需要保持清醒的头脑，以便当风刮起的时候，可以分清它的性质，找出它的来龙去脉。对于风，战国时期一位颇为有名的辞赋作家宋玉，就曾经作过区别。他在一篇名为风赋的文章里，把风分为两大类，一类是贵族的风，他称做雄风；一类是平民的风，他称做雌风。对前一类风，他大加渲染，说它“生于地，起于青萍之末”；说它“绿泰山之阿，舞于松柏之下”；说它“徘徊于桂椒之间，翱翔于激水之上”。他说这种风吹到人身上可以治病解酒，可以“发明耳目，宁体便人”，真是十分的美妙，至于后一种风，他则描写成另外一种样子。他说这种风“塕然起于穷巷之间”，刮起来的时候一路上带着砂石尘土，气味难闻。这种风吹到人的身上，叫人浑身难受，引起许多疾病，甚至把人搞得半死不活。很明显地，宋玉是站在统治阶级立场讲话的。因此，同他相反，他所赞美的，正是我们所厌恶的；而他所认为下贱的，在我们看来，则是推动人类历史发展的真正的雄风。
    但有的时候，面对着复杂的阶级斗争，一些人却被各方面袭来的风刮得昏头转向，不辨东西；有的人在政治上患了伤风症，遇到了风却分辨不出它的气味来，这种情况是十分危险的。去年5月间，当我们党正准备着手进行整风的时候，资产阶级右派就吹来了一股逆风。这股风居然想把中国历史车轮吹得倒退，想取消党的领导，想要反对社会主义。不少人在当时的情况下，弄不清这股风的来历，一下子不知道怎样应付。还有人甚至跟着这股风胡跑一气，到后来才发现风向不对，转过身来同它作战。更早些时候，就在1955年的下半年，也曾刮起一股风。在这股风的影响下，不少人说合作化的步子走得太快了，农民不欢迎。但是识别风向的能手毛泽东同志，却没有被它所迷惑。他指出，这股风不过是从少数富裕中农那里吹来的，他们掀起这股风只是为了阻碍农业合作化的前进。毛泽东同志要我们注意河北省的一个很小的合作社。这个合作社在三户贫农的坚持下，终于办得很好。毛泽东同志说：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向”。正是由于毛泽东同志善于识风向，知道什么才是真正广大农民群众的要求，从而就在当时，他已经准确地判断出中国农村即将出现一个社会主义改造的高潮。现在人们都清楚地看到，毛泽东同志的话已完全变为现实了。
    不过辨别风向的困难，还在于那种刚发生的小风。这种微小的风通常不容易为人们察觉到。但是有些风，开始的时候尽管不大，而随着社会生活的发展，它终将成为历史舞台上压倒一切的雄风。要识别这种风就需要能够即小见大，需要科学的预见。早在一百多年前，当工人阶级还是一个比较弱小的力量的时候，马克思和恩格斯就看到它将成为推翻资本主义制度、建立社会主义社会的伟大的阶级。现在果然如马克思和恩格斯所预见的，工人阶级所掀起的共产主义运动已在世界范围内蓬勃发展，而且现在的情况已经是“东风压倒了西风”。同样，毛泽东同志也具有这样科学预见的天才。当第一次国内战争失败以后，革命力量曾经大为削弱。当时就有些人悲观起来。但毛泽东同志在一篇著名的文章“星星之火，可以燎原”中却指出：“现在虽只有一点小小的力量，但是它的发展会是很快的。”当1930年，中国还处在反动的国民党的黑暗统治之下的时候，毛泽东同志在这篇文章中就预言，中国将出现革命的高潮。他写道：“……我所说的中国革命高潮快要到来，决不是如有些人所谓‘有到来之可能’那样完全没有行动意义的、可望而不可即的一种空的东西。它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿”。现在人民的新中国早已诞生，新中国的航船正在社会主义的海洋上迅速行驶，而中国人民在党和毛泽东同志领导下取得的一次又一次的胜利，正如日中天，耀人眼目。
    在识别风向的问题上，伟大的革命导师曾不止一次地为我们作出榜样。只要我们更仔细地考察一下实际生活，就会在这方面发现更多的模范事例。
    很明白地，识别风向，特别是识别那种刚发生的微小的风，对于一个革命领导干部来说是有着重大意义的。这种风如果是发生于人民群众中的，那末，在识别以后，人们就将更有信心更加坚定地往正确的方向前进。要是这种风是从敌对方面吹来的，那末，在识别以后，人们就会及时地把它扑灭，防止它的发展。
    紧跟着识别风向的另一个重要问题，就是关于插旗子的问题。在复杂的社会生活中，革命的同反动的、先进的同落后的两种力量，经常处在矛盾和斗争的状态。作为一个革命的战士，毫无疑问地，决不是一个旁观者，决不应仅满足于客观地指出历史的发展趋向就算了。坚强的革命战士总是不断地为实现先进的阶级的要求而努力，并不断地同反动的势力进行斗争。当社会面临巨大的变革，当革命的暴风雨到来的时候，他不仅能够识别风向，看清前进的道路，而且总是擎起人民的大旗，走在队伍的前列，迎着反动势力所掀起的风，向前迈进。在前进的道路上，他将毫不犹豫地把所遇到的各种反动的旗子拔去，插上先进的人民的旗子。
    世界上任何地方，只要有人，就会有旗子，不是先进的革命的旗子，就是反动的落后的旗子，人们是不会看到完全空白的地带的。拿我国的情况来看，从解放以来，社会主义势力同资本主义势力曾经经过多次激烈的斗争。在斗争中，社会主义势力曾取得一次又一次的胜利，从而社会主义的红旗也越来越普遍地插在全国广大地区。但同时，资本主义势力也总竭力在挣扎，不断地活动，他们要求过“四大自由”，提出过“取消党的领导”等等。事实表明，只要一有机会，他们就要把自己的白旗树起。尽管目前社会主义势力已占有绝对的优势，但这两种势力的斗争，仍然没有停止。并且，不论在什么地方，如果我们不坚决插上社会主义的红旗，那末，在那里资本主义的白旗就一定会出现。因此，为了推动社会的发展，中国人民当前的任务就是要把社会主义的红旗插遍全国的各个角落，把一切阻碍社会主义事业前进的落后的和反动的旗子拔个干净。
    要插红旗，要在当前社会主义建设大跃进的时代里充当一名先进的旗手，最重要的就是要具有敢说敢想敢做的共产主义的风格，要打破那种束缚人的思想的自卑感。因为只有这样，人们才能面对着各色各样的所谓“权威”，插上社会主义的红旗，才能毫不迟疑地，把那些在专家、学者等好听名义下偷偷摸摸地树起的白旗一根根地拔掉。
    在插红旗的问题上，同样地我们应该学习毛泽东同志的榜样。在中国工人阶级的革命运动中，不论是在民主主义革命时期，或是在社会主义革命时期，毛泽东同志永远是中国人民的伟大的卓越的旗手。跟随着他所擎起的红旗，中国人民曾越过无数阻碍和艰险，曾克服许多巨大的困难，一往无前地从胜利走向胜利。而那些反动的旗子，则在光辉的毛泽东同志的大旗前面，一面又一面地倒了下去。现在毛泽东同志所树起的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，正迎风招展。在这幅巨大的红旗的指引下，中国人民正以冲天干劲创造着一个又一个的奇迹。同时，相形之下，这幅大旗显得如此之壮丽、雄伟，而其他的敌对方面的旗子则是如此之渺小、丑陋。
    应该看到，辨风向、插红旗，这不仅在阶级社会里有着重大意义，就在阶级消灭以后，也是必要的。因为，不论任何时候，人总是有先进、中间、落后的分别的。为此，人们就应该辨别出先进的风向，打起先进的红旗，团结广大人民群众，把历史的车轮往前推进。
    要做到正确地识别风向，要成为一名先进的红旗手，重要的是要用马克思列宁主义的科学理论、用毛泽东同志的著作来武装自己，应该很好地学习唯物主义和辩证法。这是医治我们政治上的伤风症和思想上的自卑感所不可少的。但是，还必须注意的是，为了辨风向、插红旗，就必须深入地参予实际斗争，并且在实际斗争中紧密地同人民群众保持联系。只有深深地了解人民群众的思想、感情和要求，才能正确地识别风向；同时，也只有站在人民群众方面，坚定地相信和依靠人民群众，才能成为敢说敢想敢做的、具有崇高的共产主义风格的红旗手。
