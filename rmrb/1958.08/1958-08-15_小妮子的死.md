Little Nizi's Death
Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill Worker Zhao Liyuan

　　In 1939, I worked at the Yuda Textile Factory. At night, I also had to carry coal at the Xinzhongshan Iron Factory. The money I earned still wasn't enough to support my family.

　　My eldest daughter was called Little Nizi. She was lovable from birth, innocent and lively, and knew how to manage the household, speaking and acting like an adult. She was born into hunger with me. At eight or nine years old, she would go to Manwa to pick wild vegetables and grind them into flour to eat. When she was twelve, she passed the job inspection at the Yuda Textile Factory. When she got home, she happily told her mother, "Mom! I passed the job inspection. I'll earn money for you tomorrow!" Her mother, seeing how happy Little Nizi was, couldn't help but shed tears. Who could bear to send such a young child to work! When I got home from work and heard that Little Nizi had passed the job inspection, I felt indescribably sad. A father couldn't even support his children. Her body wasn't strong either. Going into the textile factory would be tough. Even if the Japanese didn't beat her to death, she would be worn out. The next day, Little Nizi and I went to the factory together.

　　The child was very clever. When she got to the fine yarn spinning, she learned how to tie knots. In less than three months, she completely learned how to watch the machines. Such a young child had to work twelve hours a day, wasn't fed enough, and was so tired during the night shift that she couldn't lift her head. The machines at that time weren't good, and they always produced big flaws. If the foreman saw it, she would be severely beaten. The child didn't even dare to go to the toilet. As the days passed, Little Nizi became different from before. She was so thin that she was just a skeleton, and she didn't like to talk anymore. She accumulated a body full of illness. But there was no money to treat her. Little Nizi finally fell ill in bed and couldn't get up.

　　I had no choice but to find the foreman, Old Cui, to ask for piecework, so I could earn a little more money to treat my child. Old Cui glared at me and said, "If you want to do something profitable, go do it at home!" I was so angry that I couldn't control myself. I gritted my teeth and said, "Okay, I quit!" I turned around and left the factory.

　　When I got home, I sat on the kang and couldn't say a word. Little Nizi saw that my face was a little strange and asked me, "Dad! What's wrong with you!" I said, "I quit!" When she heard this, she got anxious and struggled to get out of bed, hugging me and saying, "Dad! Can you watch your own daughter die of illness and the whole family starve to death?" It felt like someone had grabbed my internal organs. Tears flowed down my face. Little Nizi struggled to take a breath, and with tears in her eyes, she called out, "Dad! Endure it and keep working!" Hearing my child's words, my whole body trembled. I helped her and said, "Child, lie down, I'll go work!"

　　The child was tortured into unconsciousness, her face as pale as incense ash. I went home and saw her mother watching over her in a daze. The child looked like she was about to die. I called out, "Little Nizi!" She opened her eyes and looked at me, her lips moved, and then she closed her eyes again. I held her in my arms, shaking her and calling her name. Her throat was rattling, and it was very difficult for her to breathe. She struggled to gather her strength, grabbed her mother's hand, and squeezed out a few words between breaths, "Dad—Mom—I'm not feeling well! Please save me… Dad—you have to raise my younger siblings… I…" As she spoke, she slowly closed her eyes, and the last two tears flowed from the corners of her eyes. The little hand that tightly grasped her mother's hand slowly loosened…

　　Ah, I can't go on. If Little Nizi could have lived to this day, how wonderful it would have been! (Compiled by Wang Senlin, a worker in the cloth workshop)

　　小妮子的死
　　天津棉纺三厂工人　赵立元
    1939年我在裕大纱厂做工，晚上还得到新中山铁厂去抬煤，赚来的钱还是养活不了一家人。
    我那大闺女叫小妮子，生来就叫人喜爱，天真活泼，又知道过日子，说话做事和大人一样。生下来就和我挨饿，八九岁就到漫洼拾野菜子磨面子吃。十二岁那年，她在裕大纱厂验上工了。到了家高兴的和她妈说：“妈！我验上工了，明天就给您赚钱来！”她妈看到小妮子这么喜欢，眼泪都落了下来，让这么小的孩子去干活，作妈的谁忍心呀！我下工回家听说小妮子验上工了，心里说不出的难过，一个作爹的连孩子都养不起，孩子的身子骨又不结实，进了纱厂可够呛，不叫日本人打坏，也得累坏了。第二天小妮子就和我一起进了厂。
    孩子很聪明，到了细纱学接头，不到三个月完全学会了看车。这么小的孩子，一天要干上十二个钟头的活，吃不饱，又累，上夜班睏的抬不起头来，当时的机器又不好用，总是开大花，要让当头儿的看见，就是一顿毒打，孩子连厕所都不敢去。日子长了，小妮子变得和以前不一样了，瘦得光剩了一身骨头架子，也不爱说话了，积累下一身病。治病吧又没钱，小妮子终于病倒在炕上起不来了。
    我只好去找当头的大老崔要包工活作，好多赚两个钱，给孩子治病。大老崔横眉瞪眼的说：“要干有利的，你家里去干吧！”我急得心里怒火管不住了，咬了咬牙说：“好，不干了！”转身就出厂了。
    到了家，坐在炕上一句话也说不出。小妮子看出我的脸色有点不对，就问我：“爸爸！您怎么啦！”我说：“不干了！”她一听就急了，费劲地从炕上爬起来，抱住了我说：“爸！您能看着亲生的闺女病死，全家人饿死吗？”这时好像谁抓住了我的五脏，眼泪哗哗地流下来。小妮子费力地提了口气，含着眼泪叫了一声：“爸爸！忍着干吧！”我听了孩子的话，全身直打哆嗦，扶着她说：“孩子躺下吧，我干去！”
    孩子被折磨的昏迷不醒了，脸色难看得像香灰。我回家看着她妈正守着她发楞，孩子像要断气似的。我叫了一声：“小妮子！”她睁开了眼睛看了看我，嘴唇动了动，把眼又闭上了，我把她抱在怀里，摇她喊她，她嗓子呼噜呼噜地喘气都很废力了，她强打精神抓了妈的手，上气不接下气的挤出了几个字说：“爸——妈——我不好受！你们救救我……爸——您要把弟弟妹妹拉扯大……我……”说着慢慢闭上了眼睛，眼角上流出了最后两滴眼泪，紧抓着妈的小手也慢慢松开了……。
    唉，我再也说不下去了。小妮子要是能活到今天该多好哇！（布场工人王森林整理）
