　　The Pyramids of Egypt

    As people all over the world focus on the situation in West Asia, it is easy to think of Egypt, in the United Arab Republic. This ancient country with more than five thousand years of history, with the pyramids standing on the west bank of the Nile, symbolizes the brilliant culture of ancient Egypt.
    The pyramids are the tombs of ancient Egyptian emperors. Their base is square, and they are built upwards in a triangular shape, forming a "pyramid"-shaped stone tower. The largest pyramid is the Pyramid of Khufu, with each side of its base measuring more than two hundred and thirty meters, and a height of one hundred and forty-seven meters. After more than a million days of sun, rain, and wind erosion, it is now ten meters shorter than when it was first built, but it is still as high as a forty-story building. Its volume is more than two and a half million cubic meters, and the building is constructed of two million three hundred thousand stone blocks, each averaging three thousand kilograms. Each stone block is meticulously polished, and the seams are joined together almost without any gaps. This was built by the Egyptian people four to five thousand years ago. Such a magnificent building, in terms of construction scale and supply of building materials, would be a great project even today.
    The reason why the pyramids have been able to stand to this day, in addition to the large base, gradual reduction in layers, and the use of large stone blocks for construction, which provides strong stability, is also due to the fact that the people who built the pyramids at that time had already found a cementing material with greater adhesion than clay to build the stone blocks. That is plaster. The Nile River basin has abundant gypsum deposits. They mixed gypsum with clay, baked it with fire to make calcined gypsum, and then mixed it with water as mortar to build the stone blocks. The use of gypsum requires baking at a temperature of about 190 degrees Celsius, which marks the first page of the building materials industry opened by mankind.
    The pyramids are world-renowned ancient buildings. Egypt and our country have both had glorious historical cultures, and today we stand shoulder to shoulder on the front line against imperialist aggression. Thinking of the pyramids, we wish the Arab people victory in their struggle for national independence!

　　埃及的金字塔
　　泥工
    当全世界人们注视着西亚局势的时候，很容易使人想到阿拉伯联合共和国的埃及。这个具有五千多年历史的古国，耸立在尼罗河西岸的金字塔，象征着古埃及灿烂的文化。
    金字塔是埃及古代帝王的坟墓，它的底边是四方形的，上面以三角形向上砌筑，成为一个“金”字形石塔。最大的金字塔是库夫金字塔，它的底边每边有二百三十多公尺，高度有一百四十七公尺，经过一百多万天日晒雨淋、风雨浸蚀，现在虽然比刚修时矮了十公尺，但仍然相当于四十层楼房那么高。它的体积有二百五十万立方公尺以上，建筑物是用二百三十万条、每条平均有三千公斤的石条砌筑的。每块石条都琢磨得很细，拼合的缝道几乎不留一丝空隙。这是埃及人民在四、五千年前建造的。这样雄伟的建筑，在施工规模和建筑材料供应方面，即使在今天也是一项伟大的工程。
    金字塔所以能够屹立到今天，除了底边大，逐层缩小，又用大石块砌筑，稳定性强以外，另一个原因是由于当时建造金字塔的人们，已经找到了比粘土更有粘结力的胶合材料来砌筑石块。那就是石膏。尼罗河流域有丰富的石膏，他们把石膏和粘土搅拌，用火焙烧以后，成为熟石膏，然后用水拌和，作为灰浆来砌筑石块。使用石膏，需要摄氏一百九十度左右的温度加以焙烧，这是人类揭开了建筑材料工业的第一页。
    金字塔是世界闻名的古代建筑。埃及和我国都曾有过辉煌的历史文化，今天又并肩站在反对帝国主义侵略的战线上。想到金字塔，我们遥祝阿拉伯人民在争取民族独立的斗争中取得胜利！
