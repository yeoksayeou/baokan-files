　　Congratulations on Early Rice and Peanuts Achieving Double High Yields

　　High-yield "satellites" of over 36,900 catties per mu of early rice and over 10,000 catties per mu of peanuts have soared from the fields of Maxihe Township in Macheng County, Hubei Province, and Shengli Township in Nan'an County, Fujian Province. This is another great joyous event in China's agricultural production this year. We warmly congratulate the comrades who launched these high-yield "satellites" of early rice and peanuts.

　　Last year, the highest record for rice yield per mu in China was over 2,400 catties for single-season rice. The record created by the Jian'guo First Cooperative in Maxihe Township, Macheng, exceeded last year's by more than fourteen times. Last year, the highest record for peanut yield per mu in China was over 1,500 catties. The highest record created in Nan'an County exceeded last year's by six times. Such high yields per unit area and such a high rate of increase are unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the winter of 1955: "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, with crop yields several times, dozens of times, or even dozens of times higher than the current ones." This year's agricultural bumper harvest fully confirms Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific prediction. The emergence of high-yield "satellites" of early rice and peanuts, like the emergence of high-yield "satellites" of wheat not long ago, is a victory for the communist style and a victory for breaking superstitions and thoroughly liberating thought. Inspired by the wheat high-yield "satellite," the comrades of the Jian'guo First Cooperative in Maxihe Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, carried forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, broke with conventions, implemented highly dense planting and many other revolutionary measures, and finally won a great victory. This vividly proves once again that "how bold people are, how productive the land is." Liberated people can create unprecedented miracles.

　　The experience of the comrades of the Jian'guo First Cooperative in Maxihe Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, in creating the highest record for early rice yield tells us that whether or not high yields can be achieved depends on whether people have the drive and measures to strive for the top. At the beginning, the ideas and various yield-increasing measures adopted by the comrades of this cooperative were not very advanced. It was not until after the wheat satellite went into orbit that they thoroughly liberated their minds, broke all conventions, resolutely pulled up the seedlings that had already grown to more than a foot high, re-tilled, re-fertilized, and densely planted the seedlings. Subsequently, they also tried every means to strengthen field management, apply topdressing, prevent lodging, and resist disasters. They worked hard to implement all measures that could increase production; they overcame and eliminated all factors that could hinder production, and thus finally achieved high yields. This experience is of great significance for the current effort to achieve a bumper harvest of autumn crops. Now is the time when autumn crops are growing rapidly. As long as we, like the comrades of the Jian'guo First Cooperative in Maxihe Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, summon up enough energy, break the "predetermination theory," and try every means to further adopt all possible measures to increase production, we will surely be able to achieve an all-round bumper harvest of autumn crops.

　　High-yield "satellites" of wheat, early rice, peanuts and other crops have gone into orbit, breaking superstitions, liberating minds, and opening up the way for large-scale bumper harvests of various crops. Our purpose in cultivating high-yield "satellites" is to provide examples and experiences for large-scale bumper harvests. We hope that while cultivating high-yield "satellites," all localities will grasp the important link of large-scale bumper harvests, conscientiously summarize the experience of high-yield "satellites," universally promote these experiences, and strive for an all-round bumper harvest.

### 祝早稻花生双星高照

　　祝早稻花生双星高照
    早稻亩产三万六千九百多斤、花生亩产一万多斤的高产“卫星”，从湖北省麻城县麻溪河乡和福建省南安县胜利乡的田野上腾空而起了。这是今年我国农业生产上又一件大喜事。我们热烈地向发射早稻、花生高产量“卫星”的同志们祝贺。
    去年，我国水稻亩产的最高纪录，单季稻是二千四百多斤。麻城麻溪河乡建国第一社所创造的纪录，比去年增长十四倍以上。去年我国花生亩产的最高纪录是一千五百多斤，南安县所创造的最高纪录，比去年增长了六倍。这样高的单位面积产量，这样高速度的增产，是古今中外所没有的。毛泽东同志在1955年冬就说过：“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍、以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。”今年的农业丰产，完全证实了毛泽东同志的科学的预见。早稻、花生高产“卫星”的出现，同不久以前小麦高产“卫星”的出现一样，是共产主义风格的胜利，是破除迷信、彻底解放思想的胜利。湖北麻城县麻溪河乡建国一社的同志们，在小麦高产“卫星”的鼓舞下，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，打破了陈规，实行了高度密植及其他许多革命性的措施，终于赢得了伟大的胜利。这又一次生动地证明，“人有多大的胆，地有多大的产”，解放了的人民可以创造出史无前例的奇迹来。
    湖北麻城县麻溪河乡建国一社的同志们创造早稻丰产最高纪录的经过告诉我们，能否取得高额丰产，决定于人们是否有敢于力争上游的干劲和措施。这个社的同志们在开始时的想法和所采取的各种增产措施并不是很先进的，直到小麦卫星上天以后，他们才彻底解放思想，打破一切陈规，毅然决然地把已经长到一尺多高的秧苗拔起来，再深耕、再增肥，并移苗密植；随后又千方百计地加强了田间管理，施追肥、防倒伏、抗灾害。一切能够增产的措施，他们都努力去作；一切能妨害增产的因素他们都把它克服和消除，因而，终于获得了高额产量。这个经验，对于目前争取大秋作物的丰收，有十分重要的意义。现在大秋作物正是迅速生长的时候，只要我们也像湖北麻城麻溪河乡建国一社同志们那样，鼓足干劲，打破“定局论”，千方百计地进一步采取一切能够增产的措施，就一定能够获得秋季作物的全面大丰收。
    小麦、早稻、花生以及其他作物的高产“卫星”上了天，破除了迷信，解放了思想，为各种农作物的大面积丰产开辟了道路。我们培育高产“卫星”的目的就是为大面积丰产提供榜样和经验。我们希望各地在培育高产“卫星”的同时，要抓紧大面积丰产这一重要环节，认真总结高产“卫星”的经验，把这些经验普遍推广，争取全面的大丰收。
