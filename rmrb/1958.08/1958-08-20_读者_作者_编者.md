Readers, Authors, and Editors

	A Deeply Touching Account
	I was deeply moved after reading "A Sweet Memory" written by Chen Sitao, a student from Beijing No. 4 Middle School, published in the People's Daily on August 4th. Based on his personal experience, this classmate vividly described how Comrade Nie Rongzhen treated him, a poor orphan, with the same kindness and warmth as a biological father. This article reveals the noble qualities of our national leaders and PLA generals in their warm care for the people, giving us a profound education.

	Reporting on the Leap Forward in Animal Husbandry
	The People's Daily frequently reports on the leap forward in various production fronts. There are also many inspiring achievements in animal husbandry. It is said that many counties in Henan Province are striving to become "Livestock Full of Pregnancy Counties" and "High-Yield Counties" this year. Among them, the Fencun Agricultural Cooperative in Lushan County has achieved "Eight years without epidemics, seven years without weight loss, and three years without empty pregnancies" in livestock raising. I hope the newspaper will introduce these kinds of examples and good experiences.

	Welcome to "Factory History"
	I read the "Factory History" special page on the eighth page of the People's Daily on August 15th in one breath and thought it was great! This is truly the style of our workers, the writing style of workers! There are no flowery words, but the content is so profound. Every piece of work shines with simplicity and moving brilliance! We workers feel especially close to it when we read it. I admire these literary flowers that bloom from the depths of the workers' hearts.
	Every article in the "Factory History" special page moved me deeply, especially after reading "The Death of Little Nizi," I couldn't help but shed tears! Little Nizi's father, the author of this article, Comrade Zhao Liyuan, said, "How wonderful it would be if Little Nizi could live to this day!" This is the voice from Comrade Zhao Liyuan's heart. This sentence fully expresses our workers' strong hatred for the old society and our deep love for the new society.
	I hope the supplement will publish more of these works. We young people urgently need to understand the tragic and bloody lives of workers in the old society, because this is a profound class education for us.

	A Little Progress We See
	I am an employee of a military reclamation farm in the border area of the motherland. Starting this year, several of us jointly subscribed to a copy of the People's Daily. Over the past few months, we have felt that the People's Daily has made progress in many aspects. For example, many articles have broken out of the narrow circle of only targeting urban people, and can take care of readers from all aspects. There are many materials aimed at the vast number of farmers, and new people and new things in rural areas are also reported more often. This is where we feel the People's Daily has made progress. Editor, do you think our feeling is correct?

	Make the Titles More Popular
	I think some of the titles in the People's Daily are still not popular enough. Take the two titles on the second page of August 4th as examples. One news title is: "Hussein knows he is at the end of his rope and is forced to throw away the bankrupt signboard of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation." The other news title is: "Italian and West German monopoly capital attempts to divide the spoils in the Middle East with the United States and Britain; the Fanfani-Adenauer meeting communique expresses dissatisfaction with the United States and Britain." The former is popular, clear, and easy to understand; the latter is not popular, and some workers do not understand what "expresses dissatisfaction" means. The readership of newspapers is the broadest, and I think the language of newspapers should strive to be popular, especially the titles.

    深切感人的记述
    读了8月4日人民日报发表的北京第四中学学生陈嗣涛写的“一段甜蜜的回忆”，很受感动。这位同学根据他的亲身经历，生动地记述了聂荣臻同志对待他这样一个穷苦的孤儿，就像亲生父亲般慈祥和温暖。这篇文章写出我们国家领导人、解放军将领对人民热情关怀的高贵品质，给予我们深刻的教育。

    报道畜牧生产的跃进
    人民日报经常报道各个生产战线上的跃进情况。畜牧业方面也有很多振奋人心的成就。据说河南省有许多县今年争取做到牲畜满怀县、丰产县，其中鲁山县缶村农业社，饲养牲畜已做到“八年无病疫，七年不掉膘，三年没空怀”。这类事例和好的经验，希望报纸加以介绍。

    欢迎“工厂史”
    一口气读完了8月15日人民日报八版的“工厂史”专页，觉得好！这真是咱们工人的风格，工人的文风！没有华丽的词藻，但内容是那样深刻，每一篇作品，都闪耀着朴实、动人的光彩！我们工人读起来特别感到亲切。我赞美这些开自工人的心灵深处的文艺花朵。
    “工厂史”专页的每一篇文章，都使我深受感动，特别是读了“小妮子的死”一文，我禁不住流下了眼泪！小妮子的父亲、这篇文章的作者赵立元同志说：“小妮子要是能活到今天该多好哇！”这是发自赵立元同志心坎上的声音。这句话充分表达了我们工人对旧社会强烈的憎恨，对新社会深挚的热爱。
    愿副刊多发表这样的作品。我们年轻人是多么迫切需要了解旧社会工人悲惨的充满血泪的生活，因为这对我们是深刻的阶级教育。

    我们看到的一点进步
    我是祖国边疆军垦农场的一个职工。从今年起我们几个人共同订阅了一份人民日报。几个月来我们感到人民日报在不少方面都有进步。比方说，很多文章跳出了光以城市人民为对象的狭小圈子，而能照顾到各方面的读者，有不少材料是以广大农民为对象的，农村的新人新事也报道得多了。这是我们体会到人民日报有进步的地方，编辑同志你认为我们这种感觉对吗？

    把标题做得通俗些
    我觉得人民日报有些标题还嫌不通俗。就拿8月4日第二版上的两个标题来说，一条新闻的标题是：“侯赛因自知山穷水尽，被迫扔掉伊约联邦破灵牌”，另有一条新闻的标题是：“意大利和西德垄断资本企图同美英在中东分脏，范范尼——阿登纳会谈公报对美英啧有烦言”。前者通俗明快，深入浅出；后者就不通俗，一些工人不懂“啧有烦言”是什么意思。报纸的读者最广泛，我觉得报纸的文字要力求通俗，特别是标题。
