　　Peanut and Corn Yields Steadily Increase
　　Wuxing Commune's Peanut Yield Exceeds 12,000 Jin Per Mu, Dongfeng Commune's Corn Yield Exceeds 5,000 Jin Per Mu
　　This newspaper reports that on August 12th, another peanut high-yield miracle appeared in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, creating a new record of 12,271 jin per mu.
　　The creator of this high-yield record is the first production team of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Chenggong Township of the county. They harvested 13,571 jin and 13 liang of dry peanuts from a peanut experimental field with an area of ​​1 mu, 1 fen, and 6 hao, with an average yield of 12,271 jin per mu, surpassing the record of 10,535 jin per mu of the Haixing Cooperative in the county. Township and commune leaders personally participated in the harvest; after the harvest, cadres from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Provincial Grain Department, as well as the director of Yongzhao Cooperative and others, measured the land and inspected it.
　　This newspaper reports that in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, a piece of land measuring 1.073 mu yielded a total of 5,488 jin of dry corn, with an average yield of 5,114 jin and 9 liang per mu. This corn field is a high-yield field of the Liu Xiaomiao Production Team of the Qingyong Brigade of the Dongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Gengji Township. It was originally wasteland and was converted into a site and manure heap in 1955. Last autumn, red sweet potatoes were planted, yielding more than 2,000 jin per mu. This spring, corn was planted, and it grew particularly well. Each plant produced a maximum of three ears, with the smallest having one ear. The ears were generally about six inches long, with the longest being more than one chi long and weighing one jin and two liang. On July 26th, the day of the harvest, the commune members were as happy as if they were celebrating a happy event. The night before, they prepared baskets, camel baskets, and frame tools to welcome the birth of a big "satellite." After breakfast, more than 40 men and women began harvesting, and they did not finish until dark.
　　This high yield of corn has greatly liberated the masses' thinking. In the past, corn was not planted here, and the average yield of dry grains was only 200-300 jin per mu. Although some corn has been planted in the past two years, only 300-400 jin per mu have been harvested. However, this year, the yield of one season of corn has increased nearly twenty times compared to previous years, which has played a great role in criticizing the conservative thinking of some commune members and striving for a greater harvest next year.
　　In addition to deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, and good field management, the most important feature of the high corn yield of the Liu Xiaomiao Team is dense planting. The row spacing of their planting is six inches, and the plant spacing is eight inches. Most of the holes have two plants, and some even have three plants. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 plants per mu. The people who participated in the accounting and acceptance included Li Xueliang, Minister of the Agricultural Work Department of the Fuyang County Party Committee, and Li Zhaoxiu, Secretary of the Gengji Township Party Committee.

　　The High-Yield Crop Group of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, harvested 7,260 jin of corn from its 1.604 mu of double-cropping corn land this year in the first season alone, equivalent to a yield of 4,526 jin per mu, or 3,621 jin of dry corn per mu.

### 花生玉米亩产步步高升　五星社花生一万二千多斤　东风社玉米五千多斤

　　花生玉米亩产步步高升
　　五星社花生一万二千多斤　东风社玉米五千多斤
    本报讯　福建省南安县12日又出现了另一个花生高产奇迹，创造了亩产一万二千二百七十一斤的新纪录。
    这个高产纪录的创造者是该县成功乡五星农业社第一生产队，他们在一丘面积为一亩一分零六毫的花生试验田里，实收干花生一万三千五百七十一斤十三两，平均亩产一万二千二百七十一斤，超过了该县海星社亩产一万零五百三十五斤的纪录。收时乡社领导干部亲自参加；收完以后，又经省农业厅、省粮食厅干部以及永照社社长等丈量土地和验收。
    本报讯　安徽阜南县有一块地一点零七三亩共收干玉米五千四百八十八斤，平均亩产五千一百一十四斤九两。这块玉米是耿集乡东风农业社青勇大队刘小庙生产队的丰产田，原来是块荒地，1955年改为场地和粪堆地，去秋栽红芋亩产两千多斤，今春种上玉米，长的特别好，每株最多结三个棒子，少的一个棒，长一般六寸左右，最长的棒子一尺多，重一斤二两。7月26日收割这天社员就像办喜事一样，头天晚上就准备好篮子、驼篮、筐头等工具，迎接大“卫星”的诞生。早饭后，四十多个男女开始收获，直到天黑才收完。
    这次玉米高产大大解放了群众思想。这里过去不种玉米，一般旱粮亩产只有二、三百斤，最近两年虽种些玉米也只收三、四百斤一亩。可是今年一季玉米却比往年产量增加了近二十倍，这对于批判某些社员的保守思想，争取明年更大丰收起了极大作用。
    刘小庙队玉米高产的经验，除深耕、肥料足和田间管理好外，最大特点是密植，他们点播的行距是六寸，株距是八寸，每穴绝大部分都是两株，有的还有三株。据计算每亩达二万株以上。参加核算验收的人，有阜南县委农工部长李学亮、耿集乡党委书记李照修等同志。
