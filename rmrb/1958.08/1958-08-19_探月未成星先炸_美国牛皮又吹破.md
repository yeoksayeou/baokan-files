Xinhua News Agency, Cape Canaveral, August 17th: American propaganda organs have recently been desperately boasting that the United States will immediately launch an artificial satellite orbiting the moon. This long-touted plan was declared bankrupt again today when a rocket carrying a small satellite exploded just seventy-seven seconds after launch.

The American small satellite was launched at Cape Canaveral at 12:18 coordinated universal time today using a three-stage rocket weighing 52 tons and over 80 feet long. The satellite weighed 85 pounds and was equipped with television equipment, which was said to originally be intended to transmit the situation on the far side of the moon back to Earth.

According to American scientists' estimates, the current distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 221,000 miles. They boasted that if this launch were successful, this artificial satellite would be 88 times farther than the previously successfully launched satellites, with a speed of 25,000 miles per hour, but this unlucky rocket only traveled more than 400 miles before breathing its last.

If we changed the Earth to the Moon, this launch would have been successful! Ying Tao

　　探月未成星先炸
　　美国牛皮又吹破
    新华社17日讯  卡纳维拉尔角消息：美国宣传机构最近拼命吹嘘美国要马上放射一颗绕月球转的人造卫星。这个吹嘘已久的计划今天又宣告破产，带着一个小卫星的火箭刚射出七十七秒钟就爆炸了。
    美国这个小卫星是今天国际标准时间十二点十八分在卡纳维拉尔角用一个重五十二吨，长八十多英尺的三级火箭发射的。卫星重八十五磅，里面装有电视装置，据说原来的打算是要把月球另一面的情况传回地球。
    据美国科学家估计，目前地球离月球的距离约为二十二万一千英里。他们吹嘘说，要是这次放射成功的话，这个人造卫星将比以前放射成功的卫星要远八十八倍，每小时时速为二万五千英里，可是这个倒霉的火箭只走了四百多英里就呜呼哀哉了。（附图片）
    假如我们把地球改称月球，这次发射就成功了！　英韬
