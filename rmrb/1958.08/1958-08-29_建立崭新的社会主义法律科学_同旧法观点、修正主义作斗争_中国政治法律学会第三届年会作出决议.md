　　Establish a New Socialist Legal Science, Struggle Against Old Legal Views and Revisionism
    Resolution Adopted at the Third Annual Meeting of the China Political Science and Law Society

    The China Political Science and Law Society held its third annual meeting in Beijing from the 20th to the 21st.

    The annual meeting heard a work report given by Vice President and Secretary-General Wu Defeng on behalf of the council. In his report, Wu Defeng said that in the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party, the Political Science and Law Society actively participated in the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, systematically exposing and criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of some Rightist elements in the political and legal circles; in accordance with the Party and the state's policies and guidelines, actively carried out legal research activities, improved editing and publishing work, developed friendly relations between China's legal circles and legal circles of various countries, and promoted the rapid advancement of the Society's work. Wu Defeng pointed out that legal science is a science with extremely strong class character, a science for carrying out class struggle. When we engage in legal research work, we encounter the struggle between the two roads and two ideological systems of the working class and the bourgeoisie almost at any time. Legal scholars must stand firmly on the working-class stand, study Marxist-Leninist theory and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, systematically study and summarize China's experience in creating a people's democratic system and revolutionary legal system over the past 30 years, and establish a new socialist legal science in China guided by Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's thought. We must resolutely break down superstitions and wage an irreconcilable struggle against old legal views, revisionism and other bourgeois political and legal thoughts. We must carry out a great destruction and great construction on the ideological front of law, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and plant the red flag of proletarian revolution everywhere. Wu Defeng said that the Political Science and Law Society is an academic organization. It should strive to contribute its strength in organizing large-scale collaboration in legal research work, mobilize and organize the broad masses of members and political and legal workers to participate in legal research activities, carry out academic discussions, and make legal research work serve the current class struggle and the great leap forward in socialist construction.

    The annual meeting discussed the work report. Deng Chumin, Li Jicheng, Zhou Xinmin, Mao Duo, Guo Lun, Yan Baohang and others spoke at the meeting on issues such as legal research work and strengthening friendly cooperation in international legal circles. Finally, the meeting unanimously approved the Society's work report and adopted a resolution.

    The annual meeting also heard Vice President Zhang Zhirang's explanation on behalf of the council regarding the revision of the articles of association, discussed the draft revision of the articles of association, and adopted the new articles of association of the China Political Science and Law Society.

    In accordance with the new articles of association, the annual meeting elected the Society's leadership. Comrade Dong Biwu continued to be elected as the President of the China Political Science and Law Society, Shen Junru, Xie Juezai, Wu Defeng, Zhang Zhirang, and Zhang Youyu were elected as Vice Presidents, and Wang Zhao and other one hundred and nineteen people were elected as members of the third council.

    After the closing of the annual meeting on the 21st, the first meeting of the third council was held immediately, electing Wu Defeng as the First Secretary of the Secretariat, Zhang Youyu, Zhang Zhirang, Li Shiying, and Yao Zhongming as Secretaries, and Ouyang Jingrong and Guo Lun as Alternate Secretaries. The meeting also discussed how the Society should implement the resolutions of the annual meeting in the future and promote a great leap forward in legal research work.

　　建立崭新的社会主义法律科学  同旧法观点、修正主义作斗争
    中国政治法律学会第三届年会作出决议
    新华社27日讯　中国政治法律学会20日到21日在北京举行了第三届年会。
    年会听取了副会长兼秘书长吴德峰代表理事会所作的工作报告。吴德峰在报告中说：一年多来，政法学会在党的领导下，积极地参加了整风运动和反右派斗争，系统地揭发和批判了政法界中一些右派分子的反动言行；依据党和国家的方针政策，积极地开展了法学研究活动，改进了编辑出版工作，发展了我国法律界同各国法律界的友好联系，推动了学会工作的迅速前进。吴德峰指出，法律科学是阶级性极为强烈的科学，是进行阶级斗争的科学，在我们从事法学研究工作的时候，几乎随时都遇到工人阶级和资产阶级两条道路、两种思想体系的斗争。法学工作者必须站稳工人阶级立场，学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东同志的著作，系统地研究和总结我国三十多年来创建人民民主制度和革命法制的经验，在我国建立以马克思列宁主义，以毛泽东同志的学说为指导思想的崭新的社会主义法律科学。必须坚决破除迷信，向旧法观点、修正主义等资产阶级政治法律思想进行不调和的斗争，在法学思想战线上大破大立，兴无灭资，插遍无产阶级革命的红旗。吴德峰说，政法学会是一个学术团体，它应当在组织法学研究工作的大协作方面，努力贡献自己的力量，动员和组织广大会员和政法工作者参加法学研究活动，开展学术讨论，使法学研究工作为当前的阶级斗争，为社会主义建设的大跃进服务。
    年会对工作报告进行了讨论。邓初民、李继成、周新民、毛铎、郭纶、阎宝航等先后在会上分别就法学研究工作和加强国际法律界的友好合作等问题作了发言。最后，一致通过了学会的工作报告，并作出了决议。
    年会还听取了副会长张志让代表理事会所作的关于修改章程的说明，讨论了章程的修改草案，通过了新的中国政治法律学会章程。
    年会依照新的章程选举了学会的领导机构。董必武同志继续当选为中国政治法律学会会长，沈钧儒、谢觉哉、吴德峰、张志让、张友渔当选为副会长，王昭等一百一十九人当选为第三届理事会的理事。
    21日在年会闭幕后，随即举行了第三届理事会第一次会议，选出吴德峰为书记处第一书记，张友渔、张志让、李士英、姚仲明为书记，欧阳景荣、郭纶为候补书记。并就学会今后如何贯彻年会的决议，推动法学研究工作大跃进，进行了讨论。
