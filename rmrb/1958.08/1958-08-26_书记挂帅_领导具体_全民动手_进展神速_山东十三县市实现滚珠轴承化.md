Party Secretary Takes the Lead, Leadership is Specific, Everyone Participates, Progress is Rapid
Thirteen Counties and Cities in Shandong Achieve Ball Bearing Implementation
Further News: As of August 17th, eight counties including Gaotang, Linyi, Ju County, Yinan, Laixi, Xintai, Yidu, and Wulian, and five suburban districts of cities including Weifang, Yantai, Jining, Linqing, and Qingdao in Shandong Province have achieved the ball bearing implementation of major farm tools ahead of schedule.
Since the Shandong Provincial Party Committee proposed to achieve ball bearing implementation of major farm tools before the end of August, many areas in the province have quickly taken action. For example, in Gaotang County, in the movement of bearing implementation of transportation tools, the people of the county carried out a blitz campaign in a fighting posture. By August 15, they had produced more than 97,580 sets of bearings and installed them on water tools, farm tools, transportation tools, and other operating tools, accounting for 82.7% of the number that should be installed. The people of Ju County also worked hard for twenty days with soaring enthusiasm, installing bearings on more than 41,000 major operating tools in the county, basically achieving ball bearing implementation. In Wulian County, tools with bearings installed account for more than 90% of the total number that should be installed. Other places such as Yidu, Laixi, Xintai, and Yinan have also quickly installed bearings on more than 80% of the major operating tools, basically achieving ball bearing implementation.
The reason why the above counties (cities) were able to achieve the ball bearing implementation of major farm tools ahead of schedule is mainly because they conscientiously implemented the instructions and spirit put forward by the Provincial Party Committee: leaders personally take command, personally take action, mobilize the whole party and the whole people, engage in indigenous methods on a large scale, and work hard and fast, forming a mass movement of bearing manufacturing in every commune and ball manufacturing in every team. For example, in Ju County, the county and township party committees were personally led by the first secretaries to strengthen leadership. Through debate, they improved the understanding of cadres and the masses, criticized right-leaning conservative ideas, and boosted revolutionary enthusiasm. Therefore, a mass movement of large-scale ball bearing implementation spread from towns to villages, from iron and woodworking factories to agricultural cooperatives, from government offices to schools, and even to small stall vendors. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants all took action together. More than 50,000 people in the county were involved in manufacturing ball bearings, truly forming a surge where factories were everywhere, everyone was a craftsman, hammers were ringing in every household, and everyone was smashing balls, ensuring the early realization of the ball bearing implementation of major farm tools.

　　书记挂帅　领导具体　全民动手　进展神速
    山东十三县市实现滚珠轴承化
    又讯　截至本月17日，山东省已有高唐、临沂、莒县、沂南、莱西、新泰、益都、五莲等八个县和潍坊、烟台、济宁、临清、青岛等五个市郊区提前实现了主要农具滚珠轴承化。
    自山东省委提出要在8月底以前实现主要农具滚珠轴承化以后，全省许多地区即迅速行动起来。例如高唐县在大搞运转工具轴承化的运动中，全县人民都以战斗的姿态开展突击战，到8月15日就生产了轴承九万七千五百八十多套，安装了水具、农具、运输工具等运转工具占应安装数的82.7％。莒县人民也以冲天干劲，奋战苦战二十天，将全县的四万一千多部主要运转工具安装上轴承，基本实现了滚珠轴承化。五莲县已安装轴承的工具占应安装总数的90％以上。其他如益都、莱西、新泰、沂南等地也将80％以上的主要运转工具迅速安装上了轴承，基本实现了滚珠轴承化。
    上述各县（市）所以能够提前实现主要农具滚珠轴承化，主要是他们认真贯彻了省委提出的：领导亲自挂帅，亲自动手，发动全党全民，大搞土法，大干快干的指示和精神，形成了社社造轴承，队队造滚珠的全民行动。如莒县县、乡党委均由第一书记亲自挂帅，加强领导，通过辩论提高了干部群众的认识，批判了右倾保守思想，鼓足了革命干劲，因而一个群众性的大搞滚珠轴承的运动从城镇到乡村，从铁木工厂到农业社，从机关到学校，以至小摊商，工农兵学商一齐行动起来，全县投入制造滚珠轴承的有五万余人，真正形成了到处是工厂，人人是工匠，家家铁锤响，人人砸滚珠的热潮，保证提前实现了主要农具滚珠轴承化。（附图表）
