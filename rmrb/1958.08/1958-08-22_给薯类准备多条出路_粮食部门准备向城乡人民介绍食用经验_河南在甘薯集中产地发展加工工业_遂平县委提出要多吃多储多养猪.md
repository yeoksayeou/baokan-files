　　Preparing Multiple Outlets for Root Crops
    Grain Departments Prepare to Introduce Consumption Experiences to Urban and Rural People
    Henan Develops Processing Industry in Concentrated Sweet Potato Production Areas
    Suiping County Party Committee Proposes to Eat More, Store More, and Raise More Pigs
    (By Our Correspondent) According to the central government's instructions to vigorously manage root crops, the Ministry of Grain established a root crop group in early March, specifically responsible for conducting research and planning on root crop management. This organization is currently strengthening cooperation with relevant central departments to better align transportation, processing, comprehensive utilization plans, and work steps. It also plans to convene a series of on-site meetings in collaboration with relevant departments to exchange experiences in root crop management.
    The Ministry of Grain will directly contact several key areas to regularly understand the situation, identify problems, and summarize experiences to promote root crop management.
    In addition, grain departments are also preparing to actively introduce technical experiences in the harvesting, processing, and consumption of root crops to urban and rural people.
    (By Our Correspondent) The Henan Provincial People's Committee held two consecutive sweet potato meetings in early August to study various specific methods for processing and storing sweet potatoes after the bumper harvest. This year, in addition to appropriately increasing the proportion of sweet potatoes as a substitute for staple food and increasing urban supply, reserving sufficient livestock feed and seeds for next year, a large amount of sweet potatoes will be used to replace grain to make various non-staple foods, wine, and alcohol. The commercial departments plan to purchase 26 billion jin of fresh sweet potatoes this year to process 1.4 billion jin of starch, 92 million jin of alcohol, and more than 1.5 billion jin of vermicelli and starch sheets, and 150 million jin of pastries. They also plan to export 900 million jin of dried sweet potato slices. The industrial departments also plan to purchase 20 billion jin of fresh sweet potatoes this year and vigorously develop alcohol production. In areas with concentrated sweet potato production, some townships and communes will develop sweet potato processing industries, using sweet potatoes to produce alcohol and replace grain in making sugar and vinegar.
    This year's task of slicing fresh sweet potatoes for processing is very heavy. It is estimated that nearly 100 billion jin of fresh sweet potatoes in the province need to be harvested, sliced, and dried within one month during the harvest season, and some need to be processed into starch in a timely manner. Therefore, the leadership departments at all levels in Henan Province are actively mobilizing the masses to mass-produce and promote sweet potato slicers in the tool reform movement. The province plans to promote and supply another 350,000 slicers and 500,000 stone mills before sweet potatoes are available on the market in September, based on the existing 320,000 sweet potato slicers.

    (By Our Correspondent) Suiping County, Henan, has achieved a bumper agricultural harvest. The Suiping County Committee of the Communist Party of China has made preliminary arrangements for next year's planting plan in a timely manner, deciding to expand the planting area of wheat and oil crops to improve people's lives and support national construction. Arrangements have also been made for the preservation and handling of this year's grain.
    This year, the average yield per mu of wheat and barley in Suiping County reached 505 jin, and the average yield per mu for the whole year, including autumn sweet potatoes and rice, can reach 2,000 jin.
    In view of the fact that this year's grain will increase several times compared with last year, the Suiping County Party Committee is preparing to solve the problem of what to do with more grain in three aspects: (1) Farmers eat more. Each person will increase their food ration by 30 jin during the wheat harvest season, and some food will be added to the masses after the autumn grain is harvested. (2) Both the county and the communes (the county has been organized into ten communes) should increase grain reserves. (3) Raise more livestock. There are more than 700,000 pigs in the county, and the plan is to increase to 1.2 million by the end of the year (an average of one pig per mu of land). Large livestock should also be actively increased.
    The county planted 400,000 mu of sweet potatoes this year, and it is estimated that each mu can produce 10,000 jin. This item alone is equivalent to more grain than the total grain output last year. Now it is preparing to slice and store them (if it rains, use drying rooms to dry them), process some into flour and wine, and use some to feed livestock. The county party committee is collecting good storage methods from various places in order to promote them to the masses.
    According to the grain harvest, the county party committee has made preliminary arrangements for next year's planting plan: this winter, 90% of the area will be used to plant wheat (75% last winter), and 150,000 mu of cotton will be planted next year (only 50,000 to 60,000 mu this year), increasing the planting of sesame, soybeans, tobacco leaves, rice and miscellaneous grains. Sweet potatoes also need to be planted appropriately. (Attached picture)

　　给薯类准备多条出路
    粮食部门准备向城乡人民介绍食用经验
    河南在甘薯集中产地发展加工工业
    遂平县委提出要多吃多储多养猪
    本报讯  根据中央大力经营薯类的指示，中央粮食部于3月初即成立了薯类小组，专责进行薯类经营的研究和规划。这个机构目前正加强与中央各有关部门的协作，使运输、加工、综合利用计划和工作步骤能更好地衔接一致。并且计划协同有关部门召开一系列的现场会议，以交流薯类经营的经验。
    粮食部将直接联系若干重点，经常了解情况，发现问题，总结经验，以推动薯类经营工作。
    另外，粮食部门还准备积极向城乡人民广泛介绍薯类收获、加工、吃用的技术经验。
    本报讯  河南省人民委员会在8月上旬连续召开了两次甘薯会议，对甘薯丰收后的加工和保管，研究了各项具体办法。今年除了适当增加甘薯代口粮的比重和增加城市的供应，留足牲口饲料及为明年留足种籽以外，将大量地以甘薯代替粮食，制成各种副食品、酒和酒精。商业部门今年就计划收购二百六十亿斤鲜薯，加工淀粉十四亿斤，酒精九千二百万斤和十五亿多斤的粉条、粉皮，一亿五千万斤的糕点。并且还计划出口九亿斤薯干。工业部门今年也计划收购二百亿斤鲜薯，大量地发展酒精生产。在甘薯集中生产的地区，部分乡、社要发展甘薯加工工业，用甘薯制造酒精和代替粮食制造糖、醋。
    今年鲜薯的加工切片任务很大，据估计，全省有近一千亿斤鲜薯需要在收获季节的一个月内，做到随收、随切、随晒，并有一部分要及时加工成为淀粉。因此，河南省各级领导部门积极发动群众在开展工具改革运动中，大量制造和推广甘薯切片机，全省计划在9月份甘薯上市以前，要在原有三十二万部甘薯切片机的基础上，再推广和供应三十五万部切片机，五十万盘水磨。  （方徨）
    本报讯  河南遂平县获得农业大丰收，中共河南遂平县委已对明年种植计划及时作了初步安排，决定扩大小麦和油料的种植面积，以改善人民生活，支援国家建设。对今年粮食的保存处理也作了安排。
    遂平县今年小麦、大麦的平均亩产量达到五百零五斤，加上秋季甘薯、水稻全年平均亩产可达二千斤。
    遂平县委鉴于今年粮食将比去年增加好几倍，即准备从三方面解决粮食多了怎么办的问题：（一）农民多吃。麦季丰收每人增加三十斤口粮，秋粮收到手后还能再给群众增加一些食粮。（二）县和公社（全县已组成十个公社）都要增加储备粮。（三）多养家畜。全县现有七十多万头猪，计划年底发展到一百二十万头（平均每亩地一头猪）。大牲畜也要积极增加。
    该县今年种四十万亩甘薯，估计每亩可产万斤，光这一项折合粮食就比去年粮食总产量还多，现正准备切片储存（如天雨则用烘烟的烘房烘干），加工做粉做酒一部分，再用一部分喂牲畜。县委正在搜集各地好的贮存方法，以便向群众推广。
    根据粮食丰收情况，县委对明年种植计划作了初步安排：今冬90％面积将用来种小麦（去冬75％），明年种十五万亩棉花（今年只五、六万亩），增种芝麻、大豆、烟叶、水稻和杂粮。甘薯也需要适当种植。（附图片）
