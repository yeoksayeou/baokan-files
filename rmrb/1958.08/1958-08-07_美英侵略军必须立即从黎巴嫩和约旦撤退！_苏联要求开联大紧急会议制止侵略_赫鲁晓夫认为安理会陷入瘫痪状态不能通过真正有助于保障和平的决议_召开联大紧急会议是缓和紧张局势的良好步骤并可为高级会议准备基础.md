Xinhua News Agency, 6th, dispatch from Moscow, 5th (TASS): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, sent replies to the US President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and French Prime Minister De Gaulle on the 5th. The letters stated that the Soviet government, in order to quickly take necessary measures to stop the aggression, has instructed its representative to the United Nations to request an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan.

The Soviet government hopes that discussing this issue at the United Nations General Assembly, with representatives from both large and small countries, will find a way to eliminate the military danger caused by the activities of the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East, and to bring peace to the region.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government is taking such a step because Eisenhower and Macmillan have refused the Soviet proposal for a summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General, and because the Security Council cannot guarantee a resolution to the situation in the Near and Middle East in the interests of peace.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers pointed out that the United Nations Security Council, in its current form, under pressure from the United States, has essentially become a special committee composed mainly of countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, while the legitimate representative of the great People's Republic of China is still being usurped by the representative of the political zombie Chiang Kai-shek. Thus, the Security Council has essentially become paralyzed and cannot pass any resolutions that are not dependent on the will of the United States and that truly help to guarantee world peace.

Khrushchev emphasized that the policy of ignoring the People's China is unwise. This great country exists, constantly consolidating and developing, regardless of whether some governments recognize it. If reason prevails, and the People's Republic of China occupies its legitimate seat in the United Nations, it will be duly appreciated by the people of all countries, because they understand that the Security Council and the United Nations, without the People's Republic of China, cannot become truly effective organizations for maintaining peace and guaranteeing security, as required by the United Nations Charter.

Speaking about the situation in the Near and Middle East, Khrushchev pointed out that the danger of the expansion and intensification of the conflict in the region has not been eliminated, and the security of the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries has not been guaranteed. To this day, the troops of armed interventionists have not withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan, and the countries of the Baghdad Pact are implementing new military measures.

Khrushchev said that under these circumstances, the Soviet government believes that it must continue to work to maintain and consolidate peace in the Near and Middle East.

Khrushchev pointed out that the people of the world correctly view the United States' entry into Lebanon and Britain's entry into Jordan as direct aggression. The allegation of "indirect aggression" threatening Lebanon has been refuted by two reports from United Nations observers. Khrushchev pointed out that under these circumstances, we do not understand under what right the US government assumes the role of arbitrator and judge, insisting that there is some indirect aggression in Lebanon. The US President's so-called "indirect aggression" argument has no basis and is an attempt to divert people's attention from the real aggression carried out by the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East.

Khrushchev pointed out that the United Nations and its Security Council are necessary international organizations, and they must embody the peace-loving aspirations of the people of all countries. However, the US government is using the Security Council, through the representatives of the participating countries in those military blocs in which the United States occupies a dominant position, to serve its selfish interests. The Security Council, in its current composition, is unable to draw objective conclusions on the situation in the Near and Middle East.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government believes that every effort must be made to develop contacts and links between national leaders of various countries. We attach particular importance to such contacts.

Speaking about convening a meeting of high-level national leaders, Khrushchev said: We are convinced that a high-level meeting of the countries we have previously proposed, with the concerted efforts of all participants, will help to find ways and means to eliminate the "Cold War" and make the outbreak of war impossible. Khrushchev said that convening a top-level meeting as soon as possible is beneficial to all countries, both large and small.

Khrushchev concluded his letters by expressing the hope that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France will support the proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. This will be a good step to ease tensions and can prepare the groundwork for accelerating the convening of a high-level meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th, dispatch from New York: The Soviet representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, acting on instructions from the Soviet government, requested on the evening of the 5th that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convened immediately to discuss the issue of convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly.

In a letter to the President of the Security Council for August, George-Picot (France), Sobolev said: "On the instructions of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, I have the honor to request you, Mr. President, to convene an emergency meeting of the Security Council immediately to consider the Soviet proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan." George-Picot has met with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to discuss the convening of an emergency meeting of the Security Council. News has it that the meeting will be held in the next few days.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th, dispatch from New York by TASS on the 6th: The Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, handed over the replies of the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, to Macmillan, De Gaulle, and Eisenhower, dated August 5th, to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 5th, and requested that these letters be distributed as United Nations documents to the representatives of all member states of the United Nations.

    赫鲁晓夫认为安理会陷入瘫痪状态不能通过真正有助于保障和平的决议
    召开联大紧急会议是缓和紧张局势的良好步骤并可为高级会议准备基础
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5日分别复信给美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理戴高乐。信中说，苏联政府为了尽快地采取制止侵略的必要措施，已经指示它的驻联合国代表要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，来讨论美国军队从黎巴嫩、英国军队从约旦撤退的问题。
    苏联政府希望，在大国和小国都有代表参加的联合国大会上讨论这个问题，将能够找出一条道路来消除由于美英的活动而在中近东造成的军事危险，并且使这个地区得到安宁。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联政府之所以采取这样的步骤是因为艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦拒绝了苏联关于召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏美英法印五国政府首脑会议的建议，而安全理事会又不能保证为了和平的利益解决中近东局势问题。
    苏联部长会议主席指出，目前形式的联合国安全理事会在美国的压力下实质上已经变成了一种主要是由参加北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织的国家组成的特殊的委员会，而伟大的中华人民共和国的合法代表的席位还被政治僵尸蒋介石的代表所窃据。于是就出现了这样的情况：安全理事会实质上陷入瘫痪状态，不能通过任何不依赖于美国意志的、真正有助于保障世界和平的决议。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，无视人民中国的这种政策是不明智的。这个伟大的国家存在着，不断巩固和发展着，不管某些政府是否承认它。如果理智能占上风，而且中华人民共和国在联合国占有自己的合法席位，这将会得到各国人民应有的评价，因为各国人民都明白，安全理事会和联合国没有中华人民共和国，就不能像联合国宪章所要求的那样，成为维护和平和保障安全的真正有效的组织。
    在谈到中近东局势的时候，赫鲁晓夫指出，在这个地区的冲突的扩大和尖锐化的危险并没有消除，伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的安全没有得到保障。到现在为止，武装干涉者的军队还没有从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退，而巴格达条约国家正在实行着新的军事措施。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在这种情况下，苏联政府认为必须继续努力以维护和巩固中近东的和平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，全世界人民把美国进兵黎巴嫩和英国进兵约旦正确地看作是直接侵略。所谓威胁黎巴嫩的“间接侵略”的论调已被联合国观察员的两个报告所推翻。赫鲁晓夫指出，在这种情况下，我们不明白美国政府根据什么权利承担起仲裁者和法官的角色，硬说在黎巴嫩发生什么间接侵略。美国总统的所谓“间接侵略”的论调没有任何根据，这种论调是企图转移人们对美国和英国在中近东进行的真正侵略的注意。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，联合国和它的安全理事会是必要的国际组织，它们必须体现各国人民爱好和平的愿望。然而，美国政府却通过美国在其中占统治地位的那些军事集团的参加国的代表利用安理会为它的自私自利的利益服务。安全理事会在目前这种组成的状况下不能够就中近东局势问题作出客观的结论。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府认为，必须尽力发展各国国家活动家之间的接触和联系。我们特别重视这种接触。
    在谈到召开高级国家领导人会议时，赫鲁晓夫说：我们确信，按照我们过去所建议的那些国家举行的高级会议，在所有参加者一致努力的情况下，将有助于找到消除“冷战”状态的道路和手段，并且使战争的爆发成为不可能。赫鲁晓夫说，尽快地召开最高级会议有利于一切国家，不管是大国和小国。
    赫鲁晓夫最后在信中表示希望美国、英国和法国政府支持关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议。这将是一个缓和紧张局势的良好步骤，并且可以为加速高级会议的召开准备基础。
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫奉苏联政府的指示，在5日晚上要求立即召开安全理事会紧急会议，来讨论召开联合国大会紧急特别会议的问题。
    索波列夫在写给安全理事会8月份主席乔治—皮科（法国）的信里说：“根据苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的指示，我荣幸地要求你，主席先生，立即召开安全理事会紧急会议来考虑苏联提出的关于召开联合国大会紧急特别会议来讨论美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队撤出约旦问题的建议。”乔治—皮科已经会见了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，讨论召开安全理事会紧急会议的事情。有消息说，这个会议将在日内举行。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约6日讯：苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫5日把苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫8月5日给麦克米伦、戴高乐和艾森豪威尔的复信交给了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并且要求把这些信件作为联合国的文件分发给联合国全体会员国的代表。
