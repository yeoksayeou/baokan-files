    Accelerating the Training of Skilled Worker Technicians
    Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory Establishes Youth Academy of Sciences

    (Our dispatch) Chongqing’s largest Construction Machine Tool Factory recently established a Youth Academy of Sciences.

    The Deputy Secretary of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory Party Committee serves as the President, with renowned advanced producer Liao Shigang and the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee as Vice Presidents.

    Establishing the Youth Academy of Sciences is a major measure to strengthen scientific and technological research and accelerate the training of skilled worker technicians. With the development of the technological revolution movement, a large number of innovative figures have emerged among young workers. They have soaring revolutionary drive and determination, but their scientific and technological theoretical knowledge is insufficient. The Youth Academy of Sciences was established to solve this problem.

    The Youth Academy of Sciences has majors in mechanical processing, tool creation, machine manufacturing, and hot forging and casting. The first batch of forty-five researchers were all recommended by the workshops as individuals with outstanding achievements in technological innovation. At the inaugural meeting of the Youth Academy of Sciences, Liao Shigang, a young milling worker and Vice President, said, "We must connect with reality, absorb richer knowledge from books, and create even higher and greater scientific miracles, turning flat ground into peaks." Then, in response to the arduous task of the factory currently trial-producing new products in large quantities, such as universal lathes and gantry planers, he proposed ten research projects, including the manufacturing of tool fixtures, metal cutting, and the basic design principles of process regulations, allowing the researchers to choose for themselves.

    加速培养工人技术骨干
    重庆建设机床厂创办青年科学院
    本报讯　重庆最大的建设机床厂，最近创办了一所青年科学院。
    中共重庆建设机床厂委员会副书记担任院长，著名的先进生产者廖世刚和团委书记担任副院长。
    创办青年科学院，是加强科学技术研究和加速培养工人技术骨干的一项重大措施。随着技术革命运动的开展，青年工人中不断涌现大批的革新人物。他们有冲天的革命干劲和钻劲，但科学技术理论知识不够，青年科学院就是为了解决这个问题而创办的。
    青年科学院设有机械加工、工具创造、机器制造、热锻铸等专业。第一批四十五名研究员都是由各车间推荐出来的革新技术有出色成就的人。在青年科学院成立大会上，青年铣工、副院长廖世刚发言说：“我们一定要联系实际，从书本上吸收更丰富的知识，创造出更高更多的科学奇迹，把平地变成高峰。”接着他针对本厂目前试制元车、龙门刨床等大批新产品的艰巨任务，提出刀具夹具制造、金属切削和工艺规程的设计原理基础等十个研究项目，让研究员们自己挑选。
