　　Everyone Pays Attention to Hygiene, Everyone Loves Cleanliness
    Great Achievements in Qinghai's Patriotic Health Campaign
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Patriotic Health Campaign centered on eliminating the four pests has achieved significant results in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province. This assessment was given by the Qinghai branch of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team after a focused inspection of six counties and one city in the agricultural region.
    To date, the agricultural region of the province has basically achieved "four eliminations and five cleans" in one-third of the population areas. Regarding personal hygiene, with the widespread establishment of bathhouses and barbershops in rural areas, the vast majority of farmers have changed their past situation of not washing their faces or bathing all year round. Many young farmers and activists in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene have also begun to develop good hygiene habits such as brushing their teeth, gargling, cutting their nails, and washing and changing their shirts.
    Due to the basic formation of a social atmosphere where everyone pays attention to hygiene and everyone loves cleanliness, coupled with the reduction of disease-transmitting vectors such as mosquitoes and flies, the incidence of various infectious diseases in these areas in the first half of this year decreased by 35.6% compared to the same period last year.
    Qinghai's rural areas are inhabited by a variety of ethnic groups, and superstitious ideas are deeply rooted. In carrying out the hygiene campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, struggles have been waged against all kinds of superstitious and conservative ideas. In addition to organizing thousands of people into propaganda teams to go to various places to carry out propaganda activities, Qinghai Province also conducted debates in various places. Through methods such as recalling, complaining, calculating accounts carefully, and making comparisons, ideological obstacles were cleared for the movement.
    In the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, all localities ensured that the Party Secretary took the lead and the leadership took action personally. They also adopted the method of setting up pilot projects at each level, gaining experience, and promoting it comprehensively, so that the hygiene movement was closely integrated with production.
    After realizing the benefits of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, the broad masses of farmers broke with superstition, and many farmers no longer believed in the "Kitchen God," "wooden figures," and charms that could cure diseases.

　　个个讲卫生  人人爱清洁
    青海爱国卫生运动成绩大
    据新华社讯  以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动已经在青海省的农业地区收到了显著成效，这是中央爱国卫生运动检查团青海分团在经过了农业区六县一市的重点抽查后所给予的评价。
    截至目前为止，全省农业区已经在三分之一人口的地区内基本上达到了“四无五洁”。在个人卫生方面，随着澡堂和理发室在农村的普遍建立，广大农民已经改变了过去终年不洗脸不洗澡的状况，不少青年农民与除四害、讲卫生的积极分子还开始养成了刷牙、漱口、剪指甲、洗换衬衣等良好的卫生习惯。
    由于个个讲卫生，人人爱清洁的社会风气的基本形成，加上减少了蚊蝇等传播疾病的媒介，这些地区今年上半年各种传染病的发病率比去年同期下降了35.6％。
    青海农村多种民族杂居，迷信思想浓厚，在开展以除四害为中心的讲卫生运动中曾经同形形色色的迷信保守思想展开了斗争。青海省除组织了成千人的宣传大队分赴各地开展宣传活动外，各地都进行了辩论，并通过回忆、诉苦、算细账、对比等方法，为运动扫清了思想障碍。
    各地在除四害讲卫生运动中，作到书记挂帅，领导亲自动手。并采取层层设试点，取得经验全面推广的办法，使卫生运动紧密结合生产进行。
    广大农民群众在体会到除四害和讲卫生的好处以后，破除了迷信，许多农民再也不相信能治病的“灶王”、“木人”和符咒了。
