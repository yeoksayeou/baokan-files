Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 3rd—Cambodian Prime Minister Norodom Sihanouk published an article in the "Cambodia Current Situation" weekly on the 2nd, stating, "Recognizing the Beijing government is a unanimous desire of the people because it is considered to be in line with our national interests."

Sihanouk pointed out that the decision to recognize the Chinese government was "made after careful consideration and consultation with government, National Assembly, military, administrative personnel, and mass organizations."

Sihanouk pointed out that he will continue to pursue a neutral policy and remain faithful to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Sihanouk explained that continuing to pursue this policy "does not mean that we will not adapt this policy and this approach to the overall evolution of the world situation and the development of international affairs."

The article mentioned that after recognizing China, a senior Western figure spoke to him about "the lessons of Korea, which was invaded by Red China." Sihanouk wrote, "I would find it difficult to talk to my people about the Chinese and Koreans, because my people have only experienced the threats of attack and annexation from certain non-communist countries."

In refuting the US State Department's attacks on Cambodia's recognition of China, Sihanouk wrote, "I regret that some people say there is a contradiction between my pursuing an anti-communist policy in Cambodia and my maintaining friendly or merely close relations with certain communist countries—especially China. This undoubtedly shows that they completely misunderstand the spirit and wording of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Sihanouk quoted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's words to emphasize that China's relations with Cambodia are in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. Sihanouk mentioned that Premier Zhou Enlai instructed Chinese residents in Cambodia to strictly abide by the laws and regulations of the Kingdom of Cambodia and not to engage in any political activities.

Sihanouk also emphasized that Cambodia's policy towards China is similar to India's policy.

Sihanouk concluded, "In my opinion, the best way for each country to solve problems is to pursue policies and approaches that can best guarantee its security and sovereignty."

    西哈努克谈中柬建交问题
    驳斥西方对柬埔寨独立政策的诬蔑谰言
    新华社金边3日电　柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克2日在“柬埔寨现状”周刊上发表文章说：“承认北京政府是全民一致的愿望，因为它被认为是符合我们的民族利益的”。
    西哈努克指出，承认中国政府的决定是“经过深思熟虑和征求了政府、国民议会、军事、行政方面的人士以及群众团体的意见之后作出的”。
    西哈努克指出，他将继续奉行中立政策和继续忠实于和平共处五项原则。
    西哈努克解释说，继续奉行这一政策“并不意味着我们将不去使这一政策和这一方针同世界形势的总的演变和国际事态发展相适应”。
    文章提到在承认中国以后，一位西方高级人士向他谈到“被红色中国侵犯的朝鲜的教训”，西哈努克写道：“我将难于向我国人民谈论中国人和朝鲜人，因为我国人民只经历过某些非共产党国家的袭击和吞并的威胁。”
    西哈努克在驳斥美国国务院对柬埔寨承认中国的攻击时写道：“我感到遗憾的是：竟然有人说我在柬埔寨国内奉行反对共产主义的政策和我同某些共产党国家——特别是中国——保持友谊或仅仅是接近的政策之间有矛盾。这毫无疑问表明了他们完全不懂得和平共处五项原则的精神和词句”。
    西哈努克引述了中国总理周恩来的话来强调指出：中国同柬埔寨的关系是符合于和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的。西哈努克提到周恩来总理嘱咐在柬埔寨的中国侨民严格遵守柬埔寨王国的法律和条例，而不要进行任何政治活动。
    西哈努克还强调指出：柬埔寨所奉行的对中国的政策同印度所奉行的政策是相似的。
    西哈努克最后说，“在我看来，每一个国家解决问题的最好的办法就是奉行能够最好地保证它的安全和主权的政策和方针”。
