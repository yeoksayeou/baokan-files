Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th - Indonesian President Sukarno, in his National Day speech today, demanded that American and British troops quickly withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. He said: "We demand that American and British troops withdraw from these areas as soon as possible. These foreign troops must retreat quickly, because the occupation of any foreign troops, no matter where they come from, no matter what place they occupy, will always cause events, on a greater or smaller scale, that no one would want to happen." He said: "Withdraw these foreign troops quickly, otherwise it is like playing with fire!"

The Indonesian President pointed out that Indonesia will consolidate its solidarity with the Asian and African struggle against imperialism and colonialism. He said that Asian and African nationalism "has soared into the sky." However, apparently the Western world believes that they have a responsibility to make this nationalism develop in the way they prescribe. Sukarno said that, in the end, imperialism and colonialism "will eventually be completely driven out of Asia and Africa."

When talking about the West Irian issue, Sukarno said that for seven years, Indonesia has been trying to change the attitude of the Netherlands by means of "gentle reasoning," but to no avail. Therefore, Indonesia had to take "other methods" to realize the movement to liberate West Irian. Dutch enterprises in Indonesia have been taken over, and those Dutch people who are not needed by Indonesia have been sent back. He said that this is the correct method. He called on all Indonesian people to "not hesitate, not stop." He said: "Persist, and we will be victorious."

In his speech, Sukarno talked about the simplification of the party system, which has recently attracted much attention from the Indonesian public. He believes that there are too many political parties in Indonesia, and the parties are often used to safeguard the interests of a few "party bosses." He said: "The society of the Republic can only be organized with guided democracy, and guided democracy cannot be coordinated with an extraordinarily multi-party system." Sukarno suggested "revising the electoral law and promulgating an effective political party law," and also suggested "canceling the declaration issued by the government on November 3, 1945." He said: "This declaration encourages the existence of political parties and brings the liberalism of parliament to our revolution."

Reviewing the situation in the past year, Sukarno condemned the rebels for "attempting to form a common front with foreign imperialists whose purpose is to destroy the (Indonesian) Republic and drag it (Indonesia) into the Western military bloc." He said that the victory achieved in suppressing the rebel groups has great significance. He particularly pointed out that, due to the recovery of Pekanbaru, "the open intervention, which was said to be aimed at protecting the oil interests in this area, was stopped."

Sukarno said in his speech that the political stage of the Indonesian national revolution has basically been completed, and it is now beginning to enter the social and economic stage. He said that the approach to welcoming this new stage of the national revolution will be to establish a National Planning Council, implement guided democracy, accelerate the formulation of the constitution, strengthen the New Life Movement, and simplify political parties.

Sukarno expressed the hope that the Constitutional Assembly will quickly formulate a constitution that can meet the demands of the fighting Indonesian people, and that the Constitutional Assembly will not be used as a "forum for endless debates." At the end of his speech, Sukarno called on the people to strengthen unity. He said that in this extremely important year of 1958, "the subtle differences among us, especially among government supporters, must be subordinate to saving the Republic, which should be the first thing to consider."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th - Prime Minister Djuanda said in a speech in Parliament tonight to commemorate Indonesian National Day that the people of the whole country should continue to maintain and improve vigilance.

Prime Minister Djuanda said that the rebellion of the "revolutionary government" has been suppressed by the Indonesian government. However, people related to the rebel groups are still conspiring to take various measures to achieve their goals, such as carrying out guerrilla warfare, creating various disturbances, and hindering government activities. He emphasized that foreign subversion and domestic reactionary forces have produced domestic destructive forces. Therefore, he once again reminded the members of parliament to continue to improve national vigilance.

At the same time, Prime Minister Djuanda, on behalf of the government, submitted the fiscal budget for 1959 to the parliament.

He said that expenditures on national defense and restoration of order account for the largest proportion of the national budget. This year, expenditures for suppressing the rebel groups and purchasing arms and equipment have exceeded three billion rupiah. He hoped that the Indonesian local authorities would resolutely prohibit local unauthorized barter trade with foreign countries in order to ensure that exports, which have a significant impact on the budget, can be normalized.

　　苏加诺在庆祝印度尼西亚国庆演说中说
　　殖民主义终将被赶出亚非
　　朱安达说要警惕外国颠覆活动和国内反动势力
    据新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天在庆祝印度尼西亚国庆的演说中，要求美英军队迅速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。他说：“我们要求美英军队早日撤出这些地区。这些外国军队必须赶快撤退，因为任何外国军队的占领，不论它们来自哪里，不论占领的是甚么地方，总会在或大或小的规模上引起没有任何人会希望发生的那种事件的。”他说：“赶快撤退这些外国军队，否则就等于是玩火！”
    印度尼西亚总统指出，印度尼西亚将巩固它同亚非反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争的团结。他说，亚非民族主义“已经冲天”。但是，显然西方世界认为他们有责任使这种民族主义按照他们所规定的样子发展。苏加诺说，最后，帝国主义和殖民主义“终将被完全赶出亚洲和非洲”。
    苏加诺在谈到西伊里安问题时说：有七年的时间，印度尼西亚一直试图用“温和的说理”的办法来改变荷兰的态度，结果徒劳无功。因此，印度尼西亚不得不采取“其他方法”来实现解放西伊里安的运动。印度尼西亚境内的荷兰企业接管过来了，印度尼西亚所不需要的那些荷兰人被遣送回去了。他说，这是正确的方法。他号召全体印度尼西亚人民“不要犹豫，不要停手”。他说：“坚持下去，我们将得到胜利”。
    苏加诺在演说中讲述了最近很受印度尼西亚公众注意的简化政党制度问题。他认为印度尼西亚政党太多，而党派往往被用来维护少数
  “党魁”的利益。他说：共和国的社会只能以有指导的民主制度来组织，而有指导的民主制度是不能同格外多的多党制度协调一致的”。苏加诺建议“修改选举法，颁布有效的政党法”，还建议“取消政府在1945年11月3日发表的宣言”，他说：“这项宣言鼓励政党的存在，把议会的自由主义带给我们的革命”。
    苏加诺在回顾过去一年的局势时，谴责叛乱分子“企图同目的在于摧毁（印度尼西亚）共和国并把它（印度尼西亚）拖进西方军事集团的外国帝国主义分子结成共同的战线”。他说，镇压叛乱集团所取得的胜利具有重大的意义，他特别指出，由于收复北干巴鲁，“就制止了据说目的在于保卫这个地区的石油利益的公开干涉”。
    苏加诺在他的演说中说道，印度尼西亚民族革命的政治的阶段基本上已经完成，现在正在开始进入社会和经济的阶段。他说，迎接民族革命的这个新的阶段的做法将是建立国家计划委员会，实施有领导的民主，加速制定宪法，加强新生活运动，简化政党。
    苏加诺表示希望制宪议会将迅速制定可以满足战斗的印度尼西亚人民的要求的宪法，并且希望制宪议会不会被利用来作为“无休止的辩论的讲坛”。苏加诺在结束他的演说时号召人民加强团结，他说，在1958年这个极关重要的年头，“我们中间、特别是政府支持者中间的细微分歧必须从属于拯救共和国这种应当首先考虑的事情”。
    据新华社雅加达16日电　朱安达总理今天晚上为了纪念印度尼西亚国庆节而在国会发表的演说中说，全国人民应该继续保持和提高警惕。
    朱安达总理说，“革命政府”的叛乱已经被印度尼西亚政府镇压下去了。但是，同叛乱集团有关的人士现在还在阴谋采取各种办法来达到他们的目的，例如进行游击战争、制造各种骚乱和妨碍政府的活动等。他着重指出，外国的颠覆和国内的反动势力产生了国内的破坏性力量。因此，他再一次提醒国会议员继续提高民族警惕。
    同时，朱安达总理代表政府向国会提出了1959年度的财政预算案。
    他说，国防和恢复秩序方面的支出在国家预算中占最大的比重。今年为了镇压叛乱集团以及购买军火和装备的支出已经超过了三十亿盾。他希望印度尼西亚地方当局坚决禁止当地擅自同外国进行换货贸易，以便保证对于预算有重大影响的出口，能够正常化。
