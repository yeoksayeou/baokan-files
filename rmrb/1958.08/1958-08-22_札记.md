    Purely a Lie
    Following the U.S. Navy authorities and the State Department, U.S. President Eisenhower also told reporters on August 20 that the U.S. military landing in Singapore was "purely for rest."
    However, Western news agencies have long reported that the U.S. troops landing in Singapore belong to the Third Marine Division and were transferred from Okinawa. Okinawa and Singapore are thousands of miles apart, and such a long expedition is said to be "purely for rest"! Can this kind of logic be accepted by any normal mind?
    Historical records and living reality tell people that the U.S. Marine Corps has always been the vanguard of U.S. foreign aggression. This was the case in the Philippines and Cuba in the past, and it was the case in Lebanon not long ago. Now, it is the same in Singapore. No matter how many times the U.S. aggressors repeat their lies, the people of Asia will not relax their vigilance and struggle, and they demand that the U.S. military withdraw from Singapore immediately!
    Why the Silence?
    Since British colonists occupied Singapore in 1819, no other country has ever sent a large number of troops into Singapore except for the Japanese fascists during World War II. The entry of U.S. troops into Singapore at the beginning of this month can be said to be Singapore's second "fall." However, this is a "fall" without bloodshed, a "fall" in silence.
    After the U.S. military entered Singapore, the U.S. Navy, the State Department, and the President all spoke a lot. But to this day, the British authorities have remained silent. Why is this?
    The reason is simple. Britain is willing to give up its strategic stronghold and collude with the United States to create tension in Southeast Asia, which is difficult to justify. So it has to remain silent for the time being. However, like the United States' loud cries, Britain's silence also cannot conceal the dangerous activities of the U.S. and Britain deliberately threatening peace in Southeast Asia.

　　札记
    纯粹是扯谎
    继美国海军当局和国务院之后，美国总统艾森豪威尔又于8月20日对记者说，美军登陆新加坡“纯粹是为了休息”。
    可是，西方通讯社早就报道过，在新加坡登陆的美军是属于海军陆战队第三师的，他们是从冲绳岛调来的。冲绳岛和新加坡相距几千里，这样劳师远征，居然说“纯粹是为了休息”！难道这种逻辑能够为任何正常的头脑所接受吗？
    历史的记载和活生生的现实都告诉人们，美国海军陆战队一向是美国进行对外侵略的先锋。过去在菲律宾和古巴是这样，不久以前在黎巴嫩是这样。现在，在新加坡又是这样。不管美国侵略者把谎言重复多少次，亚洲人民都不会放松警惕和斗争，他们要求美军从新加坡立即撤走！
    为何沉默？
    自从1819年英国殖民者占领新加坡以来，除了第二次世界大战期间的日本法西斯以外，还没有别的国家曾经把大批军队开进过新加坡。本月初旬美军开入新加坡，可以说是新加坡的第二次“陷落”。不过，这是兵不血刃的“陷落”，是默默无声的“陷落”。
    在美军进入新加坡以后，美国海军部、国务院和总统都出来讲了许多话。可是直到今天，英国当局倒是沉默无言。这是为什么呢？
    原因很简单。英国甘心出让自己的战略要地，和美国狼狈为奸，在东南亚制造紧张局势，这是很难加以辩解的。于是它只好暂时沉默不语。但是，同美国的哇哇乱叫一样，英国的沉默，同样也掩盖不了美英在东南亚蓄意威胁和平的危险活动。
