Post-Editing Note

　　If You Dare to Leap Forward, You Can Leap Forward
Since the summer harvest, high-yield records have been constantly appearing. What is the reason? It’s very simple: after people's minds are liberated, they dare to propose leap forward targets and dare to take advanced measures. After hard work and practical efforts, they really leap forward. If the mind is not liberated and one does not dare or want to leap forward, even if the objective conditions are good, it will not have much effect.
　　In the Taihu area of Jiangsu Province, due to being satisfied with the title of "high-yield area," the grain increase rate was only 3.49% in a few years, and the average yield last year was only over five hundred catties. After discarding ideological baggage, this year's output has increased several times, and more than a dozen early rice thousand-catty counties have emerged all at once.
　　Although Guangdong Province increased its early rice production this year, the increase was not large. Now, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the people of Guangdong are determined to get rid of complacency, work hard for four months, and strive to be at the top of the list in the year-end evaluation. This ambition is commendable, and this wish can be fully realized through hard work.

　　敢跃进就能跃进
    夏收以来，高产纪录不断出现，道理何在？很简单：人们的思想解放以后，敢于提出跃进指标，敢于采取先进措施，经过苦干实干，真的就跃进了。如果思想不解放，不敢或不想跃进，即使客观条件再好，也起不了多大作用。
    江苏的太湖地区过去由于满足于“高产地区”的称号，几年间粮食递增率只有3.49％，去年的平均产量只有五百多斤。丢掉思想包袱以后，今年的产量就成倍增加，一下出现了十来个早稻千斤县。
    广东今年早造虽然增产，但增产幅度不太大。现在广东人民在省委领导下，决心去掉骄气，苦干四个月，力争年终评比时再居于上游。这种雄心是可嘉的，这一愿望经过努力也是完全可以实现的。
