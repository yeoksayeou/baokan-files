　　Combining Points and Surfaces

    Since the summer harvest, high-yield "satellites" – new records of high yields – have been constantly appearing. At present, the movement to cultivate "satellite" fields is still developing vigorously in various places, and the momentum is getting stronger and stronger, and the enthusiasm is growing.
    Is this good or not? It's good, it's a good thing. First, more grain is harvested; second, the potential of the land is clarified; third, and most importantly, high-yield banners are established, and people's minds are liberated. In the past, people were always bound by many old experiences and old ideas, and always believed that the potential of the land was limited and production had a ceiling. Now, "satellites" have set an example, and people's minds have been liberated accordingly, which has created very important conditions for striving for large-scale high yields. Therefore, the enthusiasm and great achievements of various places in cultivating "satellite" fields should be greatly praised.
    However, some places, when cultivating "satellite" fields, have relaxed the processing of large areas of farmland, and thus have not achieved large-scale yield increases, which is not good.
    Although the yield of "satellite" fields is high, the area is small, and the proportion in the total output is limited. To increase grain production in large quantities, we must rely on large-scale harvests. Our experiment fields and "satellites" are only to set an example for large-scale high yields, create experience, promote comprehensiveness, and improve the yield of all crops on all land. Therefore, when we carry out agricultural production, we should combine point work and surface work, and promote them simultaneously. Once new successful experience is gained at one point, a field meeting should be convened immediately, or other methods should be used to spread and apply these new experiences to other places, so that they can blossom and bear fruit on a large area of land, and all work can be improved one step further. Leaders continue to go deep into individual points on a new basis to create new experiences and new records, and at the same time spread and promote newer experiences to the vast areas. In this way, repeated cycles, each time higher than the last, and production will move forward step by step. Conversely, if we ignore large-scale high yields and only focus our attention on a few high-yield satellites, then these satellites will lose their "demonstration" significance, and the production level of the entire society will stagnate. This principle is very clear.
    Some people say: High-yield satellites are all deeply ploughed one or two feet, apply tens of thousands of pounds of fertilizer, and also apply a large amount of chemical fertilizer, irrigate sufficiently, and take care of them many times... How can ordinary cultivated land do all this? Therefore, they believe that today we can only engage in small-area high yields, and it is impossible to achieve large-area high yields. These comrades have forgotten a truth: the power and wisdom of the people are infinite. As long as the broad masses are fully mobilized and the enthusiasm of the masses is brought into play, they can not only launch "satellites" but also increase the yield of large areas of farmland. Didn't Xiaogan County in Hubei Province not only launch a "satellite" of more than 15,000 jin of early rice, but also increase the yield of more than 300,000 mu of early rice in the county from more than 600 jin to more than 1,700 jin, more than double last year! In fact, although we cannot concentrate as much manpower and material resources on large areas of cultivated land as we do on satellite fields, the experience on satellite fields can still be applied. Appropriate close planting, the selection of good varieties, striving to strengthen field management, scientific water use, scientific fertilization... These can all be applied to large areas of cultivated land. The problem is still that the leadership attaches importance to putting large-scale yield increase in an important position, and actively organizes and mobilizes the masses to promote and apply new experiences and new methods from satellite fields. This year, some regions have achieved major achievements in large-scale high yields (such as Hunan and Jiangxi), which proves that the statement that "only small-area high yields" is untenable. Now everyone is talking about "breaking superstitions," and this superstition of "only small-area high yields" should also be broken as soon as possible.

　　点和面要结合起来

    夏收以来，高产“卫星”——高额丰产新纪录不断出现。目前各地培育“卫星”田的运动还在蓬勃发展，而且声势越来越大，劲头越干越足。
    这样好不好呢？好，是好事情。第一，多收了粮食；第二，摸清了土地的潜力；第三也是最主要的，树立了高产旗帜，解放了人们的思想。过去人们总被许多老经验、旧观念束缚着，总认为土地潜力有限，生产有顶。现在，“卫星”给做出了榜样，人们的思想也随着解放了，这就为争取大面积丰产创造了十分重要的条件。因此，各地培育“卫星”田的热情和巨大成就是应当大大赞扬的。
    然而有些地方在培育“卫星”田的时候，却放松了对大面积农田的加工，因而没有取得大面积增产，这就不好了。
    “卫星”田产量虽高，但面积很小，在总产量中占的比例是有限的，要粮食大量增产，必须依靠大面积丰收。我们搞试验田、搞“卫星”，只是为了给大面积高产树立榜样，创造经验，推动全面，使一切土地的一切作物的产量都能提高。所以我们在进行农业生产的时候，就应当把点的工作和面的工作结合起来，同时推进。在一个点上取得了新的成功的经验，就要马上召集现场会议，或者用别的办法，把这些新经验传播和推广应用到别的地方，使它在大片土地上开花结果，使全面工作都提高一步。领导者们一面在新的基础上继续深入到个别的点上去创造新经验，新纪录，一面又把更新的经验传播推广到广大地区上去。这样循环往复，一次比一次提得更高，生产也就一步步地向前发展了。反之，如果忽视了大面积丰产，仅仅把注意力集中到少数高产卫星上去，那这些卫星就会失去它们的“示范”的意义，整个社会的生产水平也就会停滞不前。这道理是很明白的。
    有人说：高产卫星都是深翻一二尺，施肥好多万斤，还施了大量的化学肥料，灌水充足，侍弄许多遍……一般耕地哪里能都照这样做呀？所以他们认为今天只能搞小面积高产，无法使大面积丰产。这些同志忘记了一个真理：人民群众的力量和智慧是无穷无尽的。只要把广大群众充分动员起来，发挥了群众的干劲，既可以放出“卫星”，又能提高大面积农田的产量。湖北孝感县不是既放了一万五千多斤的早稻“卫星”，又使全县三十多万亩早稻产量由六百多斤提高到一千七百多斤，比去年增加两倍多吗！事实上，在大片耕地上虽然不能都像在卫星田上一样集中那样多的人力物力，但是卫星田上的经验却还是可以应用的。适当的密植，良种的选用，尽力加强田间管理，科学用水，科学施肥……这些就都是可以在大片耕地上应用的。问题仍然是领导重视，把大面积增产放到重要地位，积极地组织和动员群众推广应用卫星田上的新经验，新办法。今年已经有好些地区在大面积丰产上取得重大成就（如湖南，江西），这就证明“只能小面积高产”的说法是站不住脚的。现在大家都讲“破除迷信”，这种“只能小面积高产”的迷信也应当赶快破除。
