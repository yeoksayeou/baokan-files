Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 6th. Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk said in a broadcast to the nation on August 6th that his upcoming visits to China, India, and Burma have "only one purpose, and that is to strengthen and develop the traditional friendly and united relations with these countries in order to defend peace and freedom."

Sihanouk also said that during the days when he was not the head of government, his country had almost no contact with other countries, which isolated his country from other countries.

Sihanouk said: A certain foreign country once contemptuously said to us that Cambodia is a small country, how dare it associate with these countries. I replied that precisely because we are aware that we are a small country, we do not participate in any side of the disputes between blocs, but maintain friendly relations with all countries, regardless of their political systems.

Sihanouk added that he personally believes that every small country should avoid two dangers: avoiding joining any military blocs and avoiding isolation from other countries.

    友好团结保卫和平自由
    西哈努克谈访中印缅目的
    新华社金边6日电　柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王在6日向全国发表广播演说时说，他将要对中国、印度和缅甸进行的访问“只有一个目的，那就是加强和发展同这些国家之间的传统的友好和团结的关系，以保卫和平与自由”。
    西哈努克还说，在他不当政府领导人的那些日子里，他的国家同其它国家几乎没有进行什么接触，这就使他的国家同其它国家隔离开来。
    西哈努克说：某一个外国曾经轻蔑地对我们说，柬埔寨是一个小国，它怎敢同这些国家结交。我回答说，正因为我们意识到自己是个小国，所以我们不参加集团之间争端的任何一方，而同所有国家，不管它们的政治制度如何，保持友好关系。
    西哈努克又说，他个人认为，每一个小国应当避免两个危险，即避免参加任何军事集团和避免同其它国家隔离开来。
