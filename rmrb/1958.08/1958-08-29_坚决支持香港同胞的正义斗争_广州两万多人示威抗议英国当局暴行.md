Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 28th: Today afternoon, over 20,000 people from Guangzhou's education sector, press circles, universities, and middle schools held a demonstration to protest the Hong Kong British authorities' acts of destroying the Chinese people's education cause in Hong Kong and assaulting Chinese compatriots.

　　The demonstration procession began to move towards the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 2:40 PM. Professors and teachers from Guangzhou's various institutions of higher learning walked at the forefront of the procession. Professor Chen Xintao, head of the Parasitology Research Group at Zhongshan Medical College, walked at the very front of the teachers' demonstration, angrily waving his fist to protest the Hong Kong British authorities' bloody crimes. He told reporters with fervor: The British authorities should understand that the liberated Chinese people are not to be trifled with. We resolutely support our government's serious protest to the British government and firmly demand that the Hong Kong British authorities apologize to the victims, compensate for losses, severely punish the perpetrators, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future.

　　In the Zhongshan University contingent, Wang Qi, the head of the Chinese Department, held high the red flag, leading more than 200 teachers from the university to participate in the demonstration. Professor Lin Jianpeng of Zhongshan Medical College, who had lived in the South African colony under British imperialism for many years, participated in the Dong District protest rally yesterday, and today, he joined the young people in shouting slogans: The British government must immediately cease its hostile provocations against the Chinese people!

　　In the demonstration procession, Du Bo Kui walked at the front of the teachers. He is a witness to and a victim of the Hong Kong British authorities' atrocities. Today was the first time in his life that he participated in such a magnificent demonstration. He told reporters that he once again remembered the teachers and students of the Chung Wah Middle School who were persecuted in Hong Kong. Although the Hong Kong British authorities forcibly closed the Chung Wah Middle School and brutally assaulted our compatriots, this will not intimidate the 600 million Chinese people who have stood up.

　　Among the demonstrators were also reporters and staff from the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po offices in Guangzhou. The batons of the Hong Kong British police stirred up their old and new hatred. None of them have forgotten the series of criminal activities carried out by the Hong Kong British authorities under the guise of "freedom of the press," infringing upon the rights of Chinese journalists to conduct interviews. In the press contingent, many people used to work for the Hong Kong Wah Kiu Yat Po. They had a deep understanding of the Hong Kong British authorities' consistent hostility towards the Chinese people's press endeavors. Today, they loudly protested the Hong Kong British authorities' infringement upon the personal freedom and legitimate interviewing rights of Chinese journalists.

　　Among the university student contingent, seven alumni of Chung Wah Middle School from South China Institute of Technology, South China Agricultural College, South China Normal College, Jinan University, and other schools, accused the Hong Kong British authorities of their atrocities a few minutes before the parade.

　　In the middle school student contingent, Liang Duanyi, a second-year student at Guangzhou Kindergarten Normal School and the daughter of Liang Zhiqi, the Director of Studies of Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School who was beaten by British police, constantly waved her fist and shouted slogans in the parade. That evening, she wrote a letter to her father: "Your daughter is supporting you, and 600 million people are supporting you!"

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 28th: Today afternoon, 6,000 representatives from all walks of life in Guangzhou gathered at the Guangzhou Gymnasium to protest the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. The representatives fully supported the two protest notes lodged by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the British government.

　　Chen Song, a representative from the Sanyuanli people of Guangzhou, said at the meeting that the Hong Kong British authorities' violence has enraged us. In the future, we must resolutely engage in large-scale grain production and large-scale steel production to support the just struggle of our Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. We warn the Hong Kong British authorities that such acts of robbery must not occur again in the future. Ruan Jingqing, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Education Trade Union, representing 22,000 educators in Guangzhou, believes that the Hong Kong British authorities' atrocities demonstrate their extreme hatred for the Chinese people's education cause and their provocation against all Chinese educators. He said that if the Hong Kong British authorities do not immediately cease such atrocities, they will surely be smashed to pieces before the Chinese people! Yang Kuizhang, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Journalists Association, representing all journalists in the city, stated that the Hong Kong British authorities' provocative actions fully demonstrate that they are willing to play the role of accomplice in the political conspiracy of "two Chinas" in the Far East, deliberately created by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Others who spoke at the meeting included Guan Youtai, an alumnus of Chung Wah Middle School and an employee of the South China Sewing Machine Factory, student representative Sun Changju, Bai Juyi, the blind Cantonese opera star, Guangzhou Cement Factory workers, and First Heavy Machinery Factory workers, all protesting the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities.

　　坚决支持香港同胞的正义斗争
    广州两万多人示威抗议英国当局暴行
    新华社广州28日电　今天下午，广州市教育界、新闻界和大、中学校学生两万多人举行示威游行，抗议香港英国当局摧残香港中国人民教育事业和殴辱中国同胞的暴行。
    示威游行的队伍在下午两时四十分陆续向中山纪念堂进发。广州各高等院校的教授、教师们走在队伍的最前列。中山医学院寄生虫教研组主任陈心陶教授走在教师示威队伍的最前列，他愤怒地挥舞拳头，抗议香港英国当局的血腥罪行。他激愤地对记者说：英国当局应该明白，解放了的中国人民是不好碰的，我们坚决拥护我国政府向英国政府的严重抗议，坚决要求香港英国当局向被迫害者道歉、赔偿损失、严惩肇事凶手、保证以后不再发生类似事件。
    中山大学的队伍里，中文系主任王起高举着红旗，率领该校二百多教师参加示威游行。曾经在英帝国主义统治下的南非殖民地生活过多年的中山医学院教授林剑鹏，昨天参加了东区的抗议大会，今天，他又和青年们一起高呼口号：英国政府必须立即停止敌对中国人民的挑衅！
    在示威游行队伍中，杜伯奎走在教师的前列。他是香港英国当局暴行的见证人和受害者。今天是他有生以来第一次参加这样雄壮的游行示威行列。他对记者说，他再一次想起了在香港受迫害的中华中学师生们。尽管香港英国当局用强行封闭中华中学校舍和蛮横殴辱我国同胞，但这都吓不倒已经站起来的六亿中国人民。
    在游行的队伍中，还有香港大公报、文汇报驻广州办事处的记者和工作人员。香港英国警察的警棍勾起了他们的新仇旧恨。他们谁也没有忘记，香港英国当局在“新闻自由”的烟幕下，所进行的一系列侵犯中国新闻工作者采访权利的罪恶活动。在新闻界的队伍中，有不少人是从前在香港华商报工作过的。他们对香港英国当局一贯仇视中国人民新闻事业的活动有过深切的体会。今天，他们高声抗议香港英国当局侵犯中国记者的人身自由和正当采访权利。
    在大学生队伍中，华南工学院、华南农学院、华南师范学院、暨南大学等学校的七名中华中学校友，在游行前的几分钟，控诉了香港英国当局的暴行。
    在中学生队伍中广州幼儿师范学校二年级学生、被英国警察殴打的香港中华中学教导主任梁治球的女儿梁端仪在游行队伍中不断地挥动着拳头高呼口号。当天晚上她就写信告诉她的父亲：“女儿在支持你，六亿人民在支持你！”
    据新华社广州28日电　今天下午，广州市各界代表六千人，在广州体育馆集会抗议香港英国当局的暴行。代表们完全拥护我国外交部向英国政府提出的两个抗议照会。
    广州市三元里人民代表陈崧在会上说，香港英国当局的行凶使我们激怒起来，我们今后要坚决大搞粮食、大搞钢铁，来支援香港中国同胞的正义斗争。我们警告香港英国当局以后不得再有这种强盗行为的事件发生。代表广州市二万二千个教育工作者的市教育工会主席阮镜清认为香港英国当局的暴行表明他们对中国人民教育事业的极端仇视和对中国全体教育工作者的挑衅。他说，香港英国当局如不立刻停止这种暴行，一定要在中国人民面前碰得头破血流！广州市新闻工作者协会副会长杨奎章代表全市新闻工作者表示，香港英国当局的挑衅行为充分说明它不惜在美帝国主义和蒋介石集团蓄意制造远东紧张局势中串演“两个中国”的政治阴谋的帮凶角色。在会上讲话的还有中华中学校友、华南缝纫机厂职员关佑泰、学生代表孙昌炬、双目失明的粤剧名演员白驹荣、广州水泥厂工人和第一重型机器厂工人抗议香港英国当局的暴行。
