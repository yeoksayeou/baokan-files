According to the Jilin Daily: In order to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch an even larger-scale anti-drought and harvest protection movement, vigorously mobilizing the masses to fight the drought to the end. On the evening of August 4th, the Provincial Party Committee held a province-wide rural work telephone conference. Zhang Shiying, Minister of the Rural Work Department, gave instructions on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee at the meeting.

At present, a mass, province-wide anti-drought movement is in full swing in Jilin. According to statistics from August 1st, the number of people participating in drought resistance reached 5,159,000, accounting for 46.22% of the province's total population. More than 400,000 wells have been dug, more than 77,000 springs and riverbeds have been excavated, and 1.5 million hectares of land have been irrigated, accounting for 35.3% of the province's total cultivated land. However, with the exception of Tonghua, Yanbian and other areas where rainfall has alleviated the drought, other counties are continuing to fight the drought. In the areas most severely affected by drought, such as Gongzhuling, municipalities and counties directly under the province, and Baicheng, 50%-60% of the land that has been irrigated is showing signs of drought again, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious.

Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee has decided to continue to vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out the anti-drought struggle, and will not retreat until complete victory is achieved. The Provincial Party Committee requires that every Party organization and every Party cadre must withstand this test.

In order to strengthen the leadership of drought resistance, the Provincial Party Committee decided that all other meetings should be postponed in areas where the drought has not been eliminated, and all efforts should be concentrated on leading drought resistance. Provincial, prefectural, and county-level organs should, with the exception of a small number of people remaining to maintain the work of the organs, go to the countryside to participate in and lead the masses in the struggle against drought. All localities should conscientiously implement the Central Committee's instructions "on grasping the field management of autumn grain." During the months of August, September, and October, cadres at the six levels of province, prefecture, county, district, township, and commune should converge and immerse themselves in the fields. They should not leave the fields until the drought is overcome and a comprehensive bumper harvest is achieved.

　　吉林抗旱保收运动声势浩大
　　不战胜干旱决不收兵
    据吉林日报讯　为了争取今年农业的大丰收，中共吉林省委决定继续掀起一个更大规模的抗旱保收运动，大力发动群众与干旱斗争到底。8月4日晚上，省委召开了全省农村工作电话会议，农村工作部张士英部长代表省委在会议上做了指示。
    目前吉林全省已掀起了一个全民性的声势浩大的抗旱运动高潮，据8月1日统计，全省参加抗旱人数达五百一十五万九千余人，占全省总人口的46.22％，打井四十余万眼，挖泉、挖河底七万七千余处，浇田一百五十万公顷，占全省耕地总面积的35.3％。但是目前除通化、延边等部分地区降雨，已解除旱田旱象外，其它各县仍在继续与干旱搏斗。旱象最严重的公主岭地区、省直属市县以及白城地区，已经浇过的地又有50％—60％呈现干旱，而且情况越来越严重。
    为此，省委决定继续大力发动群众进行抗旱斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵。省委要求每一个党的组织和每一个党员干部都要经得住这一考验。
    为了加强抗旱的领导，省委决定：凡是旱象没有消除的地方，其它会议都应推迟，集中全力领导抗旱；省、专、县机关，除留少数人维持机关办公外，应一律下乡参加和领导群众进行抗旱斗争。各地要认真贯彻执行中央“关于抓好秋粮田间管理”的指示，在8、9、10三个月内，省、地、县、区、乡、社六级干部会师，一律深入田间，不战胜干旱，不实现全面大丰收，决不离开田间。
