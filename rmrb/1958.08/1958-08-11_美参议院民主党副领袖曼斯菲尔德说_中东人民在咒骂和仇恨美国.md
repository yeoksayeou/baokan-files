Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 10th. According to TASS, Washington, August 9th: US Senate Democratic majority whip, Senator Mansfield, delivered a lengthy speech on August 8th in the Senate during a debate on foreign policy. Like Democratic Senator Fulbright, who delivered a speech on August 6th, Mansfield also vehemently criticized current US foreign policy in his speech. He fiercely attacked the notorious Eisenhower-Dulles Doctrine.

    Mansfield said: "Obviously, our actions in the Near and Middle East in recent years have proven that the policies we pursue are unwise. It is difficult for Americans to understand these strange practices. It is equally difficult to explain this policy to foreigners, because they are very concerned about maintaining peace, they will naturally pay attention to: what exactly do we intend to do in the Middle East?"

    Mansfield emphasized that the overbearing approach adopted by the United States in its Middle East policy caused the landing of American troops in Lebanon. He said that the United States is already in the most embarrassing situation in the Middle East. He said that we are now at least in a situation that has caused the American people to spend millions of dollars on our military operations in the eastern Mediterranean and Lebanon. In addition to these expenses, there are also millions of dollars in emergency military aid to Lebanon. The tens of millions of dollars in military aid we gave to Iraq have also been written off, and at that time we foolishly thought that this aid could maintain the country's friendly relations with the West. These hundreds of millions of dollars at best only make the Middle East sullenly and quietly succumb to our superior power before it can challenge us.

    Mansfield continued: "At best, this will make many people in the Middle East curse us, leaving hatred in their memories for the foreign troops landing on their land. I don't need to go into detail about what the worst-case scenario would be. Obviously, this would mean American troops being trapped there for a long time, which would require spending billions of dollars for many years. It could also mean war, a large-scale war. This possibility is caused by the action that brought us suddenly into Lebanon."

    Mansfield then attacked those who attempted to shift the blame for the escalation of the Near East situation to the Soviet Union, saying: "There is no benefit in shifting the blame to the Russians. The foreign troops seen by the people of the Middle East are American and British troops, not Russian troops. It is we who are in a dangerous military situation, not the Russians."

    He continued, against whom are the American troops in Lebanon fighting now? I dare to imagine that there is not a single Russian soldier within visible range of the Lebanese border. The fact is that we are not fighting the Russians in Lebanon. We haven't even met them. I guess we haven't even encountered many local communists. Mansfield said that attempting to link the actions taken by the United States in Lebanon with resolute opposition to communism "cannot help but give the impression of Don Quixote fighting windmills." In this regard, Mansfield emphasized that "if we are not objective enough and do not have enough ability to recognize the facts in the Middle East, then we probably will not have enough ability and objectivity to deal with the facts in other regions. If our policy in the Middle East is completely outdated, then it can be concluded that our policies in other parts of the world are also outdated."

    Mansfield said that the United States must "while it is not too late," formulate a "decisive and constructive foundation for a Middle East policy."

    Mansfield concluded by saying, "In order to propose a constructive foreign policy, the United States should first recognize the actual situation in the world. But that is not enough. No country can build peace independently. That is why I believe that we should be prepared to meet with representatives of any country or many countries at any acceptable time and under any acceptable circumstances, as long as doing so can provide an opportunity to get closer to consolidating peace.

    If we do not have a constructive policy that conforms to the current reality rather than according to yesterday's hopes, we will not hold meetings with anyone - whether at high-level conferences, mid-level conferences, or the lowest-level conferences."

    A noteworthy fact in this debate is that Mansfield was supported not only by Democratic Senators Sparkman and Lauche, but also by Republican Senator Aiken. Democratic Senator Humphrey even demanded that Dulles resign immediately.

    美参议院民主党副领袖曼斯菲尔德说
　　中东人民在咒骂和仇恨美国
　　他猛烈抨击艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义。他认为，美国在中东政策方面采取的蛮横方针造成美军在黎巴嫩登陆。他说，无法把近东局势的恶化嫁祸于苏联，因为“中东人民所看到的外国军队是美国和英国的军队，而不是俄国军队”。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿9日讯：美国参议院民主党多数派副领袖、参议员曼斯菲尔德8日在参议院关于外交政策的辩论中发表了长篇演说。曼斯菲尔德也像6日发表演说的民主党参议员富布赖特一样，在他的演说中猛烈抨击美国当前的外交政策。他猛烈抨击了臭名远扬的艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义。
    曼斯菲尔德说：“显然，最近几年我们在中近东的行动证明，我们奉行的政策是不明智的。美国人很难理解这种奇怪的做法。要想向外国人解释这种政策也是同样困难的，因为他们非常关心维护和平，他们会理所当然地注意：我们到底打算在中东采取什么行动？”
    曼斯菲尔德强调指出，美国在中东政策方面所采取的蛮横方针造成美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆。他说，美国在中东已经处于最难堪的境地。他说现在我们至少处在这样一种境地，这种境地使得美国人民拿出数以百万计的美元用于我们在地中海东部和黎巴嫩的军事行动。除去这些开支以外，还有数以百万计的美元用于对黎巴嫩的紧急军事援助。我们给予伊拉克的上千万美元的军事援助也已经一笔勾销，而那时我们曾愚蠢地以为这种援助可以维持这个国家对西方的友好关系的。这数亿美元至多不过使中东在能够向我们挑战以前忧闷地不动声色地屈服于我们的优势威力。
    曼斯菲尔德接着说：“往最好处设想，这会使中东的许多人咒骂我们，在他们的记忆里留下了仇恨在他们土地上登陆的外国军队的痕迹。我没有必要详细地讲最坏的情况将会是怎样。很明显，这会意味着美国军队长期陷在那里，这就要求在许多年里拿出数十亿美元开支。这也可能意味着战争，大规模的战争。这种可能性是由于使我们突然进入黎巴嫩的那种行动引起的。”
    曼斯菲尔德接着抨击了那些企图把近东局势尖锐化的罪过转嫁给苏联的人，他说：“把罪过转嫁给俄国人是不会有什么好处的。中东人民所看到的外国军队是美国和英国的军队，而不是俄国军队。处于危险的军事状态的是我们，而不是俄国人。”
    他接着说，现在美国军队在黎巴嫩反对谁呢？我敢于设想，在黎巴嫩边境的可见范围之内没有一个俄国兵。事实在于我们在黎巴嫩没有反对俄国人。我们甚至没有同他们碰过面。我猜测，我们甚至都没有碰到过很多当地的共产党人。曼斯菲尔德说，企图把美国在黎巴嫩所采取的行动同坚决反抗共产主义联系起来，“就不免使人产生唐·吉诃德同风车决斗的印象”。曼斯菲尔德在这方面强调指出，“如果不能足够客观、没有足够能力来承认中东的事实，那么，大概对待其他地区的事实也不会有足够的能力和客观性。如果我们在中东的政策已经完全过时了的话，那么可以断定，在世界其他地区的政策也过时了”。
    曼斯菲尔德说，美国必须“趁着现在还不太迟”，制订一个“果断的、建设性的中东政策的基础”。
    曼斯菲尔德最后说，“为了提出建设性的外交政策，美国应该首先承认世界局势的实际情况。可是这还不够。没有一个国家能够独立地建立和平。这就是为什么我认为，我们应该准备同任何一个国家或许多国家的代表，在任何可以接受的时刻、在任何可以接受的情况下举行会见，只要这样做能够有机会更接近于巩固和平。
    如果我们没有一个符合当前实际情况而不是按照昨天的希望的建设性政策的话，我们就不会同任何人——不管是在高级会议上，中级会议上或最低级会议上——举行会见”。
    在这次辩论中值得注意的事实是，支持曼斯菲尔德的不仅有民主党参议员斯巴克曼、劳希等人，而且还有共和党参议员埃肯。民主党参议员汉弗莱甚至要求杜勒斯立刻辞职。
