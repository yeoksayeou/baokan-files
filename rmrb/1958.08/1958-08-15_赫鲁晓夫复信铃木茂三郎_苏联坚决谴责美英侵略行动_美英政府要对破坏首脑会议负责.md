Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 14th: TASS reported from Moscow on August 14th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, wrote back to Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party. He said that if the attempts of the aggressive forces to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries succeed, the cause of peace will be in great danger. Therefore, the peace-loving people of all countries must thoroughly expose and condemn the aggressive actions of the U.S. and British ruling cliques.

He also said that the Soviet Union will, together with all socialist countries and peace-loving forces around the world, resolutely strive to make the U.S. and Britain stop their aggression against the Middle East, ease international tensions, and safeguard peace.

Suzuki Mosaburo wrote to Khrushchev on July 28th, talking about the Middle East events. Suzuki expressed his anxiety about the danger of foreign armed intervention threatening the sovereignty of Arab countries, and he emphasized that the Japan Socialist Party condemns the U.S. and British governments for sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan. Suzuki said in his letter, "We demand that the U.S. and British governments unconditionally and immediately withdraw their troops."

Khrushchev said in his reply that the Soviet Union, faithful to the principle of peaceful coexistence, firmly condemns the aggressive actions of the U.S. and British governments, which are carrying out armed intervention in the Near and Middle East for the private interests of their monopoly capitalists.

The head of the Soviet government pointed out that the U.S. and British governments are unwilling to abandon their policy of crude interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and continue to send their armed forces to the Near and Middle East in a steady stream, attempting to further expand their aggression. Khrushchev emphasized that the U.S. and British governments are directly responsible for sabotaging the Five-Power Heads of Government Conference.

Khrushchev pointed out in his letter that the dangerous situation created by the U.S. and British aggression in the Near and Middle East once again shows that as long as the "Cold War" is not ended, the arms race is not ended, and as long as the Western governments refuse to peacefully resolve urgent international issues, humanity cannot feel safe from the threat of a new war.

Khrushchev expressed his hope that reason will finally prevail, and that the summit meeting expected by the people of all countries will create conditions for easing tensions between countries and for improving the overall international situation.

Khrushchev gave high praise to the efforts of the Japanese people to safeguard peace.

    赫鲁晓夫复信铃木茂三郎
　　苏联坚决谴责美英侵略行动
　　美英政府要对破坏首脑会议负责
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫写回信给日本社会党中央执行委员长铃木茂三郎。他说，如果侵略势力麻痹各国人民警惕性的企图得逞，和平事业就要遭到极大危险。因此，爱好和平的各国人民必须彻底揭露和谴责美英统治集团的侵略行动。
    他又说，苏联将同所有社会主义国家和全世界和平力量一道坚决争取使美英停止对中东的侵略，缓和国际紧张局势和维护和平。
    铃木茂三郎在7月28日写信给赫鲁晓夫，谈到了中东事件。铃木对威胁阿拉伯各国主权的外国武装干涉的危险感到焦虑，他强调指出，日本社会党谴责美英两国政府派军队到黎巴嫩和约旦去。铃木在信中说，我们要求美英两国政府无条件地立即撤退它们的军队。
    赫鲁晓夫在回信中说，忠于和平共处原则的苏联坚决谴责美英政府的侵略行动，它们为了本国垄断资本家的私利而在中近东进行武装干涉。
    苏联政府首脑指出，美英两国政府不愿意放弃它们的粗暴干涉别国内政的方针，继续源源不断地把自己的武装部队开进中近东，企图进一步扩大侵略。赫鲁晓夫强调说，美英政府要对破坏五大国政府首脑会议负直接责任。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，美英两国的侵略行动在中近东所造成的危险局势再次表明，只要不结束“冷战”、不结束军备竞赛，只要西方国家政府拒绝和平解决迫切的国际问题，人类就不能免除新战争的威胁而感到安全。
    赫鲁晓夫表示希望理智终于会占上风，各国人民所期望召开的最高级会议将为缓和国与国之间的紧张状态、为改善整个国际局势创造条件。
    赫鲁晓夫对日本人民为维护和平所作的努力给予很高的评价。
