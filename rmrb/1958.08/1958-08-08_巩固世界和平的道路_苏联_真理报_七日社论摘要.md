Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th (TASS): Today, the Soviet "Pravda" pointed out in an editorial entitled "The Road to Consolidating World Peace" that Soviet Premier Khrushchev's new letters to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France are based on a sincere and noble concern for maintaining universal peace. All peace-loving people warmly welcome Khrushchev's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The editorial said that the Soviet proposal is in line with the interests of all countries, large and small. These proposals open a path to eliminating the US-British aggression against the Near and Middle East and consolidating world peace.

The editorial mentioned that from the very beginning of the Near East crisis, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated taking urgent and effective measures to stop the aggression as soon as it occurred. When the Soviet government discovered that the Security Council was paralyzed due to the coercive behavior of the United States and unable to stop the aggression, it immediately called for an immediate summit of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, to take emergency measures to stop the military conflict in the Arab East. However, the US and British governments actually rejected this Soviet initiative, suggesting a Security Council meeting to replace the summit.

The editorial continued that it is clear from the replies of the US President and the British Prime Minister that they stubbornly refuse to convene a five-power summit and insist on discussing the situation in the Near East within the framework of the Security Council. However, everyone knows that the Security Council has already discussed this issue, and the American diplomatic representatives used their notorious "voting machine" to prevent the Security Council from adopting effective measures to stop the aggression of the United States and Britain in the region.

The editorial said that in order to cover up their crimes, American officials are now talking about protecting the interests of small countries, saying that these countries are being threatened by some kind of "indirect aggression." Those who openly and shamelessly violate the rights of the people of small countries, blatantly interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan, Guatemala and Cuba, dare to say these things! But the reports of the United Nations observers in Lebanon have already thoroughly shattered the shameless lies of this so-called "indirect aggression" fabricated by the US diplomatic authorities.

The editorial emphasized that the aggressors must immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan! - This is the firm demand of peace-loving people in all countries. No matter what kind of diplomatic conspiracies and rhetoric the armed interventionists use, they cannot weaken the strength of this demand of the people of all countries. Only the complete withdrawal of the armed forces of the United States and Britain from Lebanon and Jordan, only the cessation of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries, can peace and tranquility appear in the Near and Middle East.

    巩固世界和平的道路
    苏联“真理报”七日社论摘要
    新华社7日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：今天苏联“真理报”在一篇题为“巩固世界和平的道路”的社论中指出，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫新写给美国、英国和法国政府首脑的信件，其基础乃是对维护普遍和平的真诚的和崇高的关怀。所有爱好和平的人民都热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫关于召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的建议。
    社论说，苏联的建议符合一切大小国家的利益。这些建议为消除美英对中近东的侵略，巩固世界和平开辟了一条道路。
    社论谈到从近东刚刚发生危机的时候开始，苏联就一直主张采取紧急的、有效的措施，以便在侵略刚刚发生时就制止它。当苏联政府一发现安全理事会由于美国的强制行为而陷于瘫痪和不能够制止侵略时，它马上就呼吁立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议，来采取紧急措施，以便停止在阿拉伯东方的军事冲突。但是，美国和英国政府实际上拒绝了苏联的这个倡议，它们建议召开安全理事会会议来代替政府首脑会议。
    社论接着说，从美国总统和英国首相的回信中可以明显地看出，他们顽固地拒绝召开五国政府首脑会议并坚持在安全理事会的范围内讨论中近东的局势问题。但是，大家都知道，安理会已经讨论过这个问题，而美国外交代表利用自己臭名远扬的“表决机器”阻挠了安理会通过有效的措施来制止美英两国在这个地区的侵略行动。
    社论说，美国官方人士为了掩饰自己的罪行，现在竟大谈保护小国的利益，说什么这些国家正在受到某种“间接侵略”的威胁。那些在光天化日之下粗暴和无耻地侵犯小国人民的权利、露骨地干涉黎巴嫩和约旦、危地马拉和古巴内政的人也竟敢讲出这些话来！但是联合国在黎巴嫩的观察员的报告早已把这个美国外交当局捏造的所谓“间接侵略”的无耻谎言彻底粉碎了。
    社论强调指出，侵略者必须立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚回去！——这是各国爱好和平人民的坚决要求。无论武装干涉者用什么样的外交阴谋和花言巧语都不能削弱世界各国人民这个要求的力量。只有美国和英国武装部队完全撤出黎巴嫩和约旦、只有外国不再干涉阿拉伯国家的内政，中近东才能出现和平和安宁。
