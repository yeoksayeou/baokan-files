Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th - Thirteen experts from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who are helping our country with socialist construction, made a special trip on the 19th to visit the Jianguo First Cooperative of Maxi River Township in Macheng County, Hubei Province, and two other agricultural cooperatives in the county.

The experts first visited the early rice high-yield experimental field of Jianguo First Cooperative, which averaged 36,956 jin per mu. They listened to a detailed introduction by Feng Fubing, the deputy director of Jianguo First Cooperative and one of the main cultivators of the experimental field, and carefully observed a portion of the rice that had not yet been harvested, as well as samples. They raised various questions regarding cultivation and field management, and Feng Fubing provided explanations and answers one by one. Subsequently, they visited a middle-season rice high-yield experimental field cultivated by Communist Party member Jiang Yanhai and others of Mingshan First Cooperative in Mingshan Township.

The experts were very interested in the two high-yield rice experimental fields of Jianguo First Cooperative and Mingshan First Cooperative. Fu Ming, the chief Soviet economic expert in China, said on behalf of the five countries' experts: The achievements made by these two cooperatives in rice production are excellent, and are the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and are a clear sign that Chinese agriculture is making great strides forward. Kominski, the leader of the Soviet expert group of the Ministry of Agriculture, said to the cooperative members: With your spirit and methods of cultivation, you will definitely achieve high yields. Polish expert Wanke, Vietnamese Democratic Republic expert Tran Nhan Phong, German Democratic Republic expert Werner, and Czechoslovak expert Novacek, all repeatedly praised the cooperative members' enthusiasm and bold innovative spirit. During the visit, the experts happily accepted gifts from Jianguo First Cooperative and Mingshan First Cooperative, including fine rice varieties and samples from the high-yield fields.

The experts visited Changfeng Cooperative in Xiaogan County on the 18th, which created a bumper harvest of 2,810 jin per mu on average and a maximum yield of 15,361 jin per mu of early rice.
