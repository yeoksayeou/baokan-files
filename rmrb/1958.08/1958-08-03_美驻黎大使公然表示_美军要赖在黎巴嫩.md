He said that another three to four thousand invading troops will continue to land later, and the continued landings will also include some tanks.

According to Western news agencies, the 1,800 U.S. invading troops who landed in Beirut today were transported from Bremerhaven, West Germany, by U.S. transport ships, and included two engineer battalions. It is revealed that the U.S. also plans to transport more than seventy tanks into Lebanon.

    美驻黎大使公然表示
    美军要赖在黎巴嫩
    据新华社2日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克今天在贝鲁特举行的记者招待会上公然表示，美国侵略军打算以“保护美国侨民的生命和财产”和“保证黎巴嫩的完整和安全”等老一套的借口继续占领黎巴嫩。
    他说，美国军队将继续执行这个“任务”。他还说，美国军队要等黎巴嫩政府要求它撤离的时候再撤退。
    在同一次记者招待会上，美国驻中东部队司令霍洛威承认，又有一千八百名美国侵略军今天在贝鲁特登陆。这批侵略军是在1日运抵贝鲁特港的。至此，美国在黎巴嫩的侵略军已达约一万二千人。他说，还将有三四千名侵略军随后继续登陆，继续登陆的还将包括一些坦克。
    据西方通讯社透露，今天在贝鲁特登陆的一千八百名美国侵略军是从西德布来梅港由美国运输舰运来的，其中包括两个工兵营。据透露，美国还打算把七十多辆坦克运进黎巴嫩。
