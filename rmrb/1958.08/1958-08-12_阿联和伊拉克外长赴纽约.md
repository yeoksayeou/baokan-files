Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 11th: The Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, Fawzi, left Cairo on the morning of August 11th for New York to serve as the head of the UAE delegation to the United Nations General Assembly emergency session.

At the airport, Fawzi told reporters that the UAE delegation would adhere to the principle that Middle East policy must be decided by Middle Eastern countries and that any policy that does not originate from the Middle East is wrong. According to reports, the UAE's plan of action at the UN General Assembly meeting had been formulated in a lengthy discussion between President Nasser and Fawzi before the latter's departure.

The "Al-Ahram" newspaper revealed on the 11th that this plan stipulates that the UAE must not tolerate any attempts to sidestep the real issues in the debate, the main ones being the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Baghdad News: Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamil left here on the 10th to attend the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session in New York.

　　阿联和伊拉克外长赴纽约
    据新华社开罗11日电　阿拉伯联合共和国外交部长法齐在11日上午离开开罗前往纽约，担任参加联合国大会紧急会议的阿联代表团团长。
    法齐在机场对记者们说，阿联代表团将坚持这样的原则：中东政策必须由中东国家作出最后决定，任何不是从中东出发的政策都是错误的。据报道，阿联在联合国大会会议上采取的态度的计划已经在法齐启程前纳赛尔总统同他进行的长时间会谈中拟定。
    据“金字塔报”11日透露，这个计划规定，阿联决不能容忍在辩论中有人企图把真正的问题撇开，其中主要的是外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。
    新华社11日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克外交部长贾迈尔已经在10日离开这里前往纽约参加联合国大会紧急特别会议。
