Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Bangkok: Bangkok newspapers report that an increasing number of Thai people are coming to the conclusion that "U.S. Aid" has not brought any benefits to Thailand.

Bangkok newspapers on the 27th quoted senior Thai officials as saying that, to this day, "U.S. Aid" has not played any role in promoting Thailand's economic development, and the United States has not built a single factory for Thailand. Thailand is still unable to use its own raw materials to manufacture certain daily necessities.

These senior officials also expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' emphasis on countries pursuing a neutral policy and giving very little "aid" to members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Nai Pote Bunnag, Secretary-General of the Thai ruling party, the National Socialist Party, and Minister of Transportation, revealed to the press on the 27th that the party had recently solicited opinions from its two hundred-plus members on the government's policies. As of July 27, more than fifty people had written their opinions, most of whom believed that Thailand should adopt an independent and autonomous policy to develop the country's economy.

The Thai newspaper "Tu Hua Hsien Wen" published an editorial on the 29th saying that "U.S. Aid" has not improved the lives of the Thai people, and Thailand's economy is increasingly in trouble. Thailand needs economic assistance, but the vast majority of American "aid" is used for military purposes.

The newspaper also accused the United States of interfering in Thailand's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS, Moscow, August 1st: "Soviet Russia" wrote that recently the United States has been vigorously touting its financial "aid" to Iran. American newspapers insist that this "aid" has saved Iran from financial bankruptcy in the past, and is now promoting the "stability" and "progress" of Iran's economic situation. The newspaper pointed out that the United States allows Iran to use no less than half of the funds from various "aid" and loans for military needs. "Soviet Russia" cited official materials to prove that the total amount of Iranian military expenditure for the 1958-1959 fiscal year is planned to be 11.7 billion rials.

The article went on to say that the "aid" provided by the United States to Iran can be fully compensated in the form of profits from oil monopolies. According to incomplete statistics, the net profit obtained by oil monopolies from Iranian oil every year is no less than 90 million US dollars.

The newspaper pointed out that U.S. "aid" to Iran will further enslave Iran to foreign monopolies and cause the Iranian government's domestic and foreign debts to pile up higher and higher. At present, Iran owes the United States and Britain a foreign debt of 280.5 million US dollars.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Pyongyang: Seoul news: In order to raise oil prices, American oil companies, which monopolize the supply of oil in South Korea, are creating an "oil shortage" in South Korea, thereby seriously hitting some industries in South Korea. According to the South Korean publication "Industrial Economic News," the amount of oil supplied to South Korea by American oil companies this year has been reduced by half compared to last year. By June of this year, many rubber factories have stopped production due to a lack of oil. South Korea's automobile transportation industry and fisheries have also been severely affected by the "oil shortage" for several months.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS, Delhi, July 31st: The U.S. intelligence agencies in India recently touted that the United States had "donated" a batch of polio vaccines to the Indian Red Cross.

However, according to the Indian News Service, Indian health workers identified all of these vaccines as waste products. The Indian News Service emphasized that the vaccines provided by the United States to India were expired. These vaccines not only lost all their medicinal properties, but would also harm patients if used.

### 美国以“援助”为名进行掠夺  泰国伊朗等国经济陷入窘境

    美国以“援助”为名进行掠夺
    泰国伊朗等国经济陷入窘境
    新华社30日讯　曼谷消息：据曼谷报纸报道，越来越多的泰国人士得出这样的结论：“美援”并没有给泰国带来甚么好处。
    曼谷的报纸27日引述泰国高级官员们的话说，直到今天，美“援”并没有起任何促进泰国经济发展的作用，美国并没有替泰国建立过一家工厂。泰国仍然无法用自己的原料来制造某些日常需要的工业品。
    这些高级官员对于美国重视奉行中立政策的国家而给予东南亚条约组织成员国很少的“援助”这一点也感到不满。
    泰国执政党国家社会党总书记、交通部长乃蓬·本那干27日向报界透露，这个党最近曾经向它的两百多党员征求他们对政府政策的意见，到7月27日为止，已经有五十多人写好了意见，其中大部分人认为泰国应当采取独立自主的政策来发展国家的经济。
    泰国报纸“图画新闻”29日发表社论说，“美援”并没有使泰国人民的生活获得改善，而泰国经济越来越陷入困境。泰国需要的是经济援助，但是，美国绝大部分的“援助”却用在军事方面。
    这家报纸还指责美国干涉泰国的内政。
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科8月1日讯：“苏维埃俄罗斯报”写道，最近美国大肆吹嘘它对伊朗的财经“援助”。美国报纸硬说，这种“援助”过去挽救了伊朗免遭财经破产，而现在正促进伊朗经济状况的“稳定”和“进步”。报纸指出，美国允许伊朗把不少于各种“援助”和贷款一半的拨款用于军事需要。“苏维埃俄罗斯报”针对这一点列举官方材料证明，1958—1959财政年度，伊朗军费总额计划为一百一十七亿里亚尔。
    文章接着说，美国向伊朗提供的“援助”可以用石油垄断组织的利润的形式全部得到补偿。据不完全统计，石油垄断组织每年从伊朗石油得到的纯利润不少于九千万美元。
    报纸指出，美国对伊朗的“援助”将使伊朗进一步受外国垄断组织的奴役，使伊朗政府的国内外债台越垒越高。目前，伊朗光是欠美英的外债就达二亿八千零五十万美元。
    新华社平壤1日电　汉城消息：垄断南朝鲜油类供应的美国石油公司为了提高油价，竟在南朝鲜制造“油荒”，从而严重地打击了南朝鲜的某些行业。据南朝鲜出版的“产业经济新闻”报道，美国石油公司今年对南朝鲜的石油供应量比去年减少了一半，到今年6月为止，已经有很多橡胶工厂因为缺少油类而停止生产。南朝鲜的汽车运输业、渔业几个月来也因为“油荒”而受到严重影响。
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社德里7月31日讯：美国在印度的情报机关不久之前，曾经大肆吹嘘美国“赠给”了印度红十字会一批脊髓灰质炎的疫苗。
    但是，据印度新闻社报道，印度保健工作人员鉴定这批疫苗全部是废品。印度新闻社强调指出，美国给印度提供的疫苗是过了期的，这批疫苗不仅失去了全部医疗性能，如果用了还会损害患者的健康。
