    A New "Satellite" for Street Work
　　Jiang Zhishui
    The residents of Erlong Road in Beijing have established a unique "Neighborhood Service Center," which is another beautiful flower blooming after the comprehensive Great Leap Forward. This service center specializes in handling daily life matters for street residents. It can purchase movie, theater, and ball game tickets, train tickets, bus and trolley monthly passes, call taxis and hire tricycles at night, handle savings and exchange government bonds, sell books, newspapers, magazines, stamps, and mail letters, pay rent, water and electricity bills, and property tax. It can also introduce nannies and help families with cleaning.
    The establishment of this "Neighborhood Service Center" has freed most residents from the complicated daily chores. It is imaginable that before this, these tedious tasks were carried out by individuals or single families, which consumed considerable individual energy and time. Now, some things can be completely handled by collective organizations, and who wouldn't be happy about that!
    The daily service activities of this service center, to a certain extent, also attract the residents in this area to a collective life, which may enable people to develop the habit of caring about the collective and begin to have an interest in living this kind of collectivist life.
    Is the development of this mass collective organization just an accidental phenomenon? Absolutely not! It is produced to meet the needs of economic development. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the demand for labor in society is increasing. Now even the streets are running factories, and almost everyone in society with the ability to work has become a producer. Objectively speaking, the time individuals spend on these trivial matters is also decreasing. The establishment of the "Neighborhood Service Center" can save a lot of social labor, allowing more people to free up their hands to produce value, create wealth, and concentrate on production, building our beautiful society.
    Many new things today are actually doing this kind of building work. For example, the nurseries, collective canteens, and collective dormitories connected in rural areas and urban streets are all examples. From this perspective, we can also see that people's living habits are developing towards a collective-centered direction on a wider scale, preparing the conditions for establishing a people's commune that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers.
    We must cherish the many new things that have appeared in society and not take them lightly. We should all promote these new achievements, so that people can see that their hands have created happiness, so that they have more confidence and strength to strive for a better life.

    街道工作的一颗新“卫星”
　　江之水
    北京二龙路的居民办了一个别开生面的“邻里服务所”，这是在全面大跃进以后生长的又一朵鲜艳的奇葩。这个服务所专门为街道居民办理生活琐事，可以代购影、戏、球票，火车票、公共汽车、电车月票，代叫出租汽车和夜间雇三轮车，代办储蓄、兑换公债，代售书报杂志、邮票和寄信，代交房租、水电费、房地产税，还可以介绍保姆，帮助家庭打扫卫生。
    这个“邻里服务所”的成立，把大部分居民从繁杂的生活琐事中摆脱出来了。可以想像，在这以前那些繁琐的事务都是以个人或单个的家庭为单位来进行的，其所消耗的个人的精力和时间是相当可观的，如今有些事情却完全可以依靠集体的组织来代办了，有谁不乐意如此呢！
    这个服务所的日常服务活动，在一定程度上也把这附近的居民吸引到一种集体生活的方面来了，这也就有可能使人们养成关心集体的习惯，开始有了过这种集体主义生活的兴趣。
    这种群众性集体组织的发展，只是一种偶然的现象么？绝不是！它是适应经济发展的需要而产生的。随着工农业生产的大跃进，社会上对于劳动力的需求愈来愈大了。现在连街道都办起了工厂，所有社会上有劳动能力的人几乎都变成了生产者，从客观方面说，个人从事这种琐事的时间也愈来愈少了。“邻里服务所”的成立正可以节约不少的社会劳动力，就能够让更多的人腾出手来去生产价值，去创造财富，集中精力从事生产，为我们这个美好的社会垒砖砌石。
    如今的许多新事物，其实都是在做这种垒砖砌石的工作。例如在农村和城市街道上举办的托儿所，集体食堂，农村里联成一片的集体宿舍等都是。从这个侧面，我们也可以看到人们的生活习惯在更广泛的范围内向着以集体为中心的方向发展。为办一个把工农商学兵合在一起的人民公社准备了条件。
    要十分珍视社会上已经出现的许多新鲜事物，不要等闲视之。我们大家都要来宣扬这些新的成绩，让人们都看到自己的双手已经创造了幸福，好更有信心和力量争取更为美好的生活。
