Current Agricultural Production Issues That Should Be Noted

    Strengthen Topdressing and Soil Cultivation for Peanuts
    Currently, early-sown peanuts in various regions have entered their peak flowering period, while late-sown peanuts are also beginning to show flowers. The quality of peanut sowing this spring has improved significantly compared to previous years, and the amount of fertilizer applied is generally more than double that of previous years. Peanuts have a long growth period, and relying solely on base fertilizer cannot meet the needs of the entire growth period. At the same time, the period from flowering to pod formation is the most vigorous stage of development for peanuts and also the period when they require the most nutrients. Therefore, seizing the current topdressing work is a crucial key to increasing peanut production.
    Peanuts require more phosphorus and potassium fertilizers during their growth period, especially from flowering to pod formation. Applying a large amount of fertilizer rich in phosphorus and potassium can promote an increase in the number of pods and make the seeds full and substantial. According to experiments conducted by the Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, under the same conditions, spreading 100 jin of straw ash per mu at the initial flowering stage increased yield by 28%, and spreading 150 jin per mu increased yield by 37.8%. According to a comparative experiment conducted by the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Xin Jin County, Liaoning Province, in 1956, topdressing with superphosphate also increased yield by 38% compared to not topdressing.
    After peanuts flower and are pollinated, the ovary stalk (fruit needle) gradually elongates and extends into the soil to bear fruit. The number of peanut flowers varies depending on the variety, but it is generally between 200 and 300 flowers per plant. The general fruit setting rate is about 15% of the number of flowers. Actively improving the growth conditions of peanuts can increase the fruit setting rate to 30% to 40%, or even more. Frequent cultivation to loosen the soil, keep the soil moist, promote air circulation, promote root development and the reproduction of rhizobium, remove weeds, and combine pre-flowering cultivation with soil cultivation and earthing-up will all help to improve the growth conditions of peanuts.
    When carrying out late-stage field management of peanuts, pay attention to careful operation, and do not damage the flowers or injure the ovary stalks due to cultivation management. Appropriate vine pressing during the peak flowering period also has a yield-increasing effect, and various regions can study and adopt it. After the peak flowering period, it is no longer suitable for cultivation, but weeds still need to be removed from the holes and between plants to avoid hindering peanut growth. According to the experience of veteran farmers: if a weed grows in a hole of peanuts, it can at least affect the growth of one pod, reducing the yield by about 30 to 50 jin per mu.

### 加强花生的追肥和中耕培土

    加强花生的追肥和中耕培土
    目前各地早播的花生已进入盛花期，晚播的也开始现花。今春花生播种质量较往年提高很多，施肥数量一般也比往年增加一倍以上。花生生长期较长，仅仅靠基肥不能满足整个生育期间的需要；同时，花生从开花到结荚是发育最旺盛的阶段，也是需要养分最多的时期。因此，抓紧当前的追肥工作，是增产花生的重要关键。
    花生生育期间需要磷、钾肥料较多，特别从开花到结荚这一时期，大量追施含磷、钾质较多的肥料，可以促使结荚数目增多，子粒成实饱满。据四川农业科学研究所试验，在同样条件下，花生初花期每亩撒施草木灰一百斤的增产28％，每亩撒施一百五十斤的增产37.8％。据1956年辽宁省新金县胜利农业社试验对比，追施过磷酸钙的比不追施的也增产38％。
    花生开花授粉后，子房柄（果针）逐渐延长伸入土中结果。花生开花数目因品种类型不同，多少不一，一般的是每株开花二、三百朵，一般结果率约占开花数的15％左右，积极改善花生的生长条件，结果率也能达到30％到40％，甚至还多一些。经常进行中耕松土，使土壤润湿，空气流通，促进根的发育和根瘤菌繁殖，铲除杂草，和开花前期结合中耕进行培土壅兜等，都会起到改善花生生长条件的作用。
    在进行花生后期田间管理的时候，要注意操作细致，不要因中耕管理碰坏了花朵和触伤子房柄。在花生盛花期进行适当压蔓也有增产效果，各地可以研究采用。盛花期以后，不宜再中耕，但仍需要在穴里、株间拔除杂草，以免妨碍花生生育。根据老农经验：如果一穴花生里生长一棵杂草，至少能影响一个荚果的成长，每亩约少收花生三十到五十斤。
