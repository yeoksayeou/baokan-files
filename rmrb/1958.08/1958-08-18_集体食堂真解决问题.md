　　Collective Canteens Really Solve Problems
    I used to be a housewife. In the upsurge of the whole people running industry, I stepped out of the home and joined the street residents' production group organized by the residents' committee. Since then, both my husband and I have had wage income, and our family life has been better than before. However, I have four children, and after I started working, my children had difficulties with meals. At first, I would come home from work at noon and in the evening and start a fire to cook. This not only prevented the children from eating on time but also kept me busy and exhausted, and the production efficiency could not be improved. Some other group members had similar difficulties. Later, after discussion among all our group members, we decided to set up a collective canteen in the courtyard of the production group. Everyone pooled furniture, assigned a dedicated person to cook, and without spending a penny, the canteen was set up.
    Now, no less than sixty or seventy people come here to eat every day, and eleven group members bring their entire families to eat.
    Since we had the collective canteen, my children and I have been able to eat on time, and I have had more time to do some housework. Therefore, I am particularly happy, and my production efficiency is improving day by day.

### 集体食堂真解决问题

　　集体食堂真解决问题
    我原来是个家庭妇女。在全民办工业的高潮中，我走出家庭参加了居民委员会组织的街道居民生产组。从此，我和爱人都有了工资收入，家庭生活比以前更好了。但是，我有四个孩子，我参加生产以后，孩子们吃饭发生了困难。起初，我每天中午和晚上下班回家以后，现生火做饭。这样不仅让孩子们不能按时吃饭，也忙得我劳累不堪，生产效率提不高。有些别的组员也有这样的困难。后来，经过我们全体组员商量，决定在生产组院里搞个集体食堂。由大家凑齐了家具，指定一个专人做饭，没花一文钱，食堂就办起来了。
    现在，每天来这里吃饭的不下六、七十人，有十一个组员全家都来吃饭。
    自从有了集体食堂，我和孩子都能按时吃饭了，我也有了更多的时间来做一些家务事。因此，我的心情特别愉快，生产效率也一天比一天提高。
