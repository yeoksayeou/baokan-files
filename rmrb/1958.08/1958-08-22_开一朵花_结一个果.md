Grow a Flower, Bear a Fruit

How to make small blast furnaces blossom, bear fruit, and have a long life – this is a problem urgently to be solved in the current Great Leap Forward in the iron and steel industry.

In the past few months, especially after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the two "marshals" (iron and steel industry and machinery industry) and two "pioneers" (electric power industry and railways) on the industrial front, a nationwide upsurge of iron smelting and steelmaking by the whole people has been set off across the country. Tens of thousands of small blast furnaces have sprung up from the ground, and the boiling molten iron is flowing. The all-round blossoming of the iron and steel industry has greatly broken the mysterious view of running industry and liberated the mind. Hundreds of millions of people have seen their own great strength from this, received great encouragement, and are excited and full of energy.

The universal establishment of small blast furnaces throughout the country is a major guarantee for the high-speed development of China's iron and steel industry. This kind of small blast furnace requires less investment, is built quickly, and the technology is relatively simple, and can be universally built in all places with iron ore. With tens of thousands of small blast furnaces, plus a number of medium-sized and large-scale modern steel plants, under unified leadership, overall planning, and division of labor and cooperation, with large, medium, and small-sized enterprises running simultaneously, China's steel production will be able to catch up with and surpass Britain in the shortest possible time. At present, more than 30,000 small blast furnaces have been established throughout the country, and steel production in many places has increased by several times or even more than ten times compared with the original, which fully proves the correctness of the central government's policy.

The current problem is that some of the small blast furnaces that have been built cannot carry out normal production, or the iron smelted is not up to standard. According to the current situation, the reasons are multifaceted. Some are because the production of ore, coke, refractory materials, and ferroalloys cannot keep up, and the blast furnace cannot get enough to eat; more are because the workers have not mastered the ironmaking technology, and the blast furnace cannot digest it even when it is full. There is nothing to be surprised about this, and there is no need to be discouraged and sigh. Because many small blast furnaces were only built this year, and many of the people who built these small blast furnaces are farmers who have never smelted steel in the past, it is completely understandable that some technical problems cannot be solved or not solved well for a while. The shortcomings mentioned above are also inevitable. However, now some people are fortune-telling for the indigenous blast furnaces, and the result of the fortune-telling is said to be very bad: "Although flowers are blooming everywhere, they are only a flash in the pan and will not last long."

Our view is completely opposite to that of the short-lived theorists. The short-lived theorists exaggerate the problems of some blast furnaces into the problems of all blast furnaces, and determine that they are incurable diseases and cannot be cured. In our opinion, for the problems of some indigenous blast furnaces, as long as active measures are taken, ask a doctor to take a look, and take some medicine, they will immediately get better. If anyone does not believe it, please see a report on page 3 of this newspaper on August 16. Doesn't it say that after a technical guidance group led by Zhou Bangjie, a steelmaking foreman of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, went to Xiaozidian Iron Smelting Plant in Dawu County, Hubei Province, and conducted systematic research on furnace construction, furnace baking, and smelting operation and took effective measures, it enabled this indigenous blast furnace to produce normally? Indigenous blast furnaces can not only produce normally, but also have a long life. There is an indigenous blast furnace in Enpu Iron Factory in Yunnan Province that has been in continuous production for six years, and they plan to continue production for another four years. Newly built indigenous blast furnaces can also produce normally. For example, more than 100 indigenous blast furnaces built in Shaanxi have been put into production, and production is generally normal. In about two months, they have produced more than 3,800 tons of iron. It depends on human effort. Since the workers of Enpu Iron Factory can make the indigenous blast furnace have a long life, why can't other places make the indigenous blast furnace have a long life?

The short-lived theorists originally believed in "foreign" and did not believe in indigenous, and were not interested in indigenous blast furnaces and indigenous methods. Now, they are taking advantage of the fact that the indigenous blast furnaces have some problems to stir up evil winds and spread negative emotions, which is not surprising at all. However, we are building indigenous blast furnaces after all in order to smelt iron and meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Therefore, even if a part or even only a very small number of furnaces cannot smelt iron, or the iron production is not normal, we must never take it lightly and must enable all blast furnaces to produce normally. In the process of development, there are always some things that run ahead and some things that lag behind. Imbalance always exists. The old imbalance is overcome, and the imbalance on the new basis will appear again. Every time the old imbalance is overcome and every time the new imbalance appears, things leap forward. Therefore, we must adhere to the theory of continuous revolution. Whichever link lags behind, we must strengthen the work of that link. After the blast furnace is built, we must follow up by seizing mining and the production of coke and refractory materials, and we must train production workers. We are Marxists, not agnostics. We believe that everything in the universe can be known, and any technical peak can be climbed. Moreover, ironmaking technology is not profound. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized steel technology guidance groups to go to various special districts and counties to provide guidance, which helped many workers and cadres master ironmaking technology, enabling many blast furnaces that could not produce iron to produce iron, and enabling many blast furnaces that could not produce normally to turn to normal production.

The incident of Hubei Province organizing steel technology guidance groups tells us a truth, that is, as long as the Party committee attaches importance to it, puts politics in command, and takes practical measures, the indigenous blast furnace can produce normally. In the past, the problem in some places was that the leaders only attached importance to construction and not to production, and did not continue to put politics in command after the transition to production. These shortcomings need to be corrected quickly in order to immediately reverse the situation of abnormal production of indigenous blast furnaces.

The on-site meeting to promote the production of small blast furnaces held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Shaoyang, Hunan Province, has ended, and there are also elixirs to ensure the normal production and longevity of blast furnaces. The key now is how to quickly combine these experiences with the specific conditions of various places and promote them universally. The best way is for leaders to personally engage in experimental furnaces (or demonstration furnaces), learn technology from experimental furnaces, summarize experience, insert red flags, and release red flowers. The purpose of engaging in experimental furnaces is to break through a point politically and technically, and drive the overall situation. Therefore, when the experimental furnace is successful, a on-site meeting must be held immediately to bring relevant cadres and workers together, ask everyone to take a look, break superstitions, dispel the evil wind of short-lived theory, and strengthen everyone's confidence. We must also ask everyone to learn, watch and operate at the same time, and impart technology face to face. The Yidu County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province used this weapon very effectively. They used the Xiannvdong Iron Smelting Plant as an "experimental field" and sent the deputy county head to personally lead technicians to experiment with using charcoal to smelt iron. After the experiment was successful, they used on-site teaching and on-site training methods to train more than 200 technicians for townships and communities, enabling the county's 24 indigenous furnaces to quickly get on the road to normal production. As long as all places do as the Yidu County Committee does, all blast furnaces will not only blossom, but also bear fruit.

This year is only the first year of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and it is still a preliminary show of strength. A greater leap forward is yet to come. The amount of steel required by industry and agriculture next year will be even greater than this year. Look at three years in ten years, look at the first year in three years, and look at this year for next year. All localities must guarantee the completion and strive to over fulfill the leap forward plan for steel production (especially pig iron production, because pig iron is currently not enough for steelmaking needs) this year in order to create conditions for a greater leap forward next year. There are still more than four months from now to the end of the year. The time is not too long, nor is it too short. As long as Party committees at all levels use the spirit of building furnaces to grasp production, fully rely on the masses, and do everything possible to grasp production, ensure that one is built well and one is produced normally, grow a flower and bear a fruit, they will definitely make great achievements on the existing foundation.

Time is steel. Everyone should seize the time!

　　开一朵花  结一个果
    怎样使小高炉开花结果、长命百岁——这是钢铁工业大跃进中当前急待解决的问题。
    在过去几个月中，特别是在党中央和毛主席提出工业战线上两个“元帅”（钢铁工业和机械工业）和两个“先行”（电力工业和铁路）以后，全国各地掀起了一个全民炼铁、全民炼钢的热潮，上万的小高炉平地起，沸腾的铁水在奔流。钢铁工业的全面开花，大大破除了办工业的神秘观点，解放了思想。亿万人民从这里看到了自己的伟大的力量，得到了巨大的鼓舞，兴高采烈，干劲冲天。
    在全国各地普遍建立小高炉，是使我国钢铁工业高速度发展的重大保证。这种小高炉投资少、建成快、技术比较简单，可以在所有有铁矿的地方普遍建设起来。有了数以万计的小高炉，加上若干中型的和大型的现代化的钢铁厂，在统一领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，大、中、小型同时并举，我国的钢铁生产就能够在最短的期间赶上和超过英国。目前全国已经建立了三万多个小高炉，许多地方的钢铁生产比原来提高了几倍以至十几倍，充分证明了中央的方针的正确性。
    目前的问题是，有部分已经建立起的小高炉不能进行正常生产，或者炼出来的铁不合规格。根据现有情况来看，原因是多方面的。有的是矿石、焦炭、耐火材料、铁合金的生产跟不上，高炉吃不饱；更多的是工人没有掌握炼铁技术，高炉吃饱了消化不了。这本来没有什么值得大惊小怪，也用不着泄气叹息。因为许多小高炉都是今年才办起来的，建设这些小高炉的人许多是过去从来没有炼过钢铁的农民，所以一些技术上的问题一时不能解决或者解决得不好，是完全可以理解的。上面所说的这些缺点也是难免的。然而，现在却有人给土高炉算命，算的结果据说很不妙：“虽然花开遍地，但只是昙花一现，寿命不长”。
    我们的看法和短寿论者完全相反。短寿论者把部分高炉的毛病夸大为所有高炉的毛病，并且断定是绝症，没法医治的。在我们看来，对于部分土高炉的毛病，只要积极采取措施，请医生看一看，吃点药，马上就会好起来的。谁不相信，请看8月16日本报三版的一篇报道，上面不是说由武汉钢铁公司炼铁工长周邦杰带领的一个技术辅导组，到湖北大悟县孝子店炼铁厂，对建炉、烘炉和冶炼操作进行系统的研究并采取了有效的措施以后，就使这座土高炉正常生产了吗？土高炉不仅可以正常生产，而且还可以长寿。云南省恩普铁厂就有一座土高炉，已经连续生产了六年，他们还准备再生产四年。新建土高炉也能正常生产，如陕西建成的一百多座土高炉已大部投入生产，生产一般也都正常，两个月左右的时间，已生产出三千八百多吨铁。事在人为，恩普铁厂的职工既然可以使土高炉长寿，别的地方为什么不能使土高炉长寿呢？
    短寿论者本来就是信“洋”不信土的，对土高炉、土办法本来就不感兴趣。现在，他们趁着土高炉有点毛病就刮歪风，散播消极情绪，一点也不奇怪。不过，我们建设土高炉毕竟是为着炼出铁来，满足工农业大跃进的需要。因此，那怕是一部分甚至只有极少数的炉子炼不出铁来，或者出铁不正常，我们也绝不能等闲视之，必须使所有高炉都能正常生产。事物在发展过程中，总是有些东西跑在前面，有些东西走在后头，不平衡总是存在着的，旧的不平衡克服了，在新基础上的不平衡又会出现。旧的不平衡的每一次克服，新的不平衡的每一次出现，事物就向前跃进一步。因此，我们必须坚持不断革命论，哪个环节落后，加强哪个环节的工作，高炉建设起来了，跟着必须抓紧开矿，抓紧焦炭、耐火材料的生产，必须培训生产工人。我们是马克思主义者，不是不可知论者。我们认为宇宙间一切事物都是可以被认识的，任何技术高峰都可以攀登。况且炼铁技术并不深奥。中共湖北省委组织钢铁技术辅导团到各专区、各县去指导一下，就帮助了许多工人和干部掌握了炼铁技术，使许多原来不能出铁的高炉出了铁，使许多原来不能正常生产的高炉转入正常生产。
    湖北省组织钢铁技术辅导团这件事告诉我们一个真理，这就是只要党委重视，政治挂帅，采取踏踏实实的措施，土高炉是可以正常生产的。过去，有些地方的毛病正是领导上只重视建设，不重视生产，没有在转入生产以后继续政治挂帅。这些缺点需要赶快纠正，才能立即扭转土高炉生产不正常的局面。
    冶金部在湖南省邵阳召开的促进小高炉生产的现场会议已经结束，保证高炉正常生产和长寿的丹方也都有了。现在的关键在于怎样迅速地把这些经验与各地的具体条件结合起来，普遍推广。最好的方法是领导亲自搞试验炉（或者叫示范炉），从试验炉中学技术，总结经验，插红旗，放红花。搞试验炉的目的，是为了从政治上、技术上突破一点，带动全面。因此，当试验炉搞成功以后，必须立即召开现场会议，把有关干部和工人找来，请大家看一看，破除迷信，驱除短寿论的歪风，坚定大家的信心。还要请大家学一学，边看边操作，当面传授技术。中共湖北省宜都县委运用这个武器很有效。他们以仙女洞炼铁厂为“试验田”，派副县长亲自领导技术工人试验用木炭炼铁，试验成功了就用实地教学、现场培训的办法，为乡社培养二百多个技工，使全县二十四座土炉很快走上正常生产。只要各地都像宜都县委那样办，所有的高炉就不仅开花，而且结果。
    今年只是工农业大跃进的第一年，还是初试锋芒，更大的跃进还在后头，明年工农业所需要的钢铁数量将比今年的更大。十年看三年，三年看头年，明年看今年。各地今年必须保证完成并争取超额完成钢铁生产（特别是生铁产量，因为目前生铁不够炼钢需要）的跃进计划，才能给明年的更大跃进创造条件。从现在到年底还有四个多月，时间不算长，也不算太短，只要各级党委用建炉那样的精神来抓生产，充分依靠群众，千方百计抓生产，保证建好一个，正常生产一个，开一朵花，结一个果，一定会在现有的基础上做出一番伟绩来。
    时间就是钢铁。大家要争取时间啊！
