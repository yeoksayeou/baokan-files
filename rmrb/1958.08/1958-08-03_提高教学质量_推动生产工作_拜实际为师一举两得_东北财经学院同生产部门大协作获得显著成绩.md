    Improve Teaching Quality, Promote Production Work
    Learn from Practice, Achieve Two Goals at Once
    Northeast University of Finance and Economics Achieves Significant Results in Great Collaboration with Production Departments
    (Our Correspondent Cao Zhixian reports) Northeast University of Finance and Economics, through socialist great collaboration with production departments, has had teachers facing production, going deep into reality, conducting investigations and research, enriching teaching content, significantly improving teaching quality, and effectively promoting business reforms in production departments.
    Since April of this year, Northeast University of Finance and Economics and the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee have worked together, and the university's five departments—Industrial Economics, Trade Economics, Finance and Credit, Agricultural Economics, and Statistics—have established collaborative relationships with more than 100 units, including leadership organs in the finance and economics system and the commercial system, as well as specialized companies, department stores, retail stores, and wholesale stations, based on the characteristics and needs of their professional teaching. They have also established regular contact with more than 300 units. On this basis, teachers from the University of Finance and Economics have stepped out of their studies, gone deep into factories and mines, come into contact with reality, conducted investigations and research, collected materials, and enriched teaching content. They have also frequently been invited to participate in relevant meetings of business departments, exchanged materials and scientific research results with business departments, and sometimes even drafted teaching syllabuses, asking business departments to help prepare lessons. Since the beginning of this semester, they have also invited heads of business departments to give more than 40 special reports to students in connection with teaching. At the same time, the faculty and students of the University of Finance and Economics, in response to major issues in practical work, have conducted social surveys jointly with collaborating units, and have helped improve the professional theoretical level of in-service cadres in finance and economics departments through the holding of mobile universities and special lectures.
    In the past, teachers at the University of Finance and Economics prepared lessons behind closed doors, and the teaching materials they taught were seriously divorced from China's actual life. After students took up their jobs, they had to start from scratch in practical work. Teachers teaching commercial economics and commercial organization technology in the Department of Trade Economics had been teaching for several years without ever having been to a commercial institution. Students said that the courses in the Department of Trade Economics had three 'mores' and two 'lesses': more foreign teaching materials, more principles and doctrines, and more regulations; less Chinese teaching materials and less Chinese reality. Students felt that what they learned was useless and did not love their major. Now, the teachers in this department regard practical work as a rich source for improving teaching. After class, everyone goes out of the school, deep into factories, enterprises, and stores, to collect the latest on-site materials, organize lecture drafts, and compile teaching materials. On this basis, three teaching and research groups in this department—Trade Organization Technology, Agricultural Products Procurement, and Trade Economics—have already added new content from practical work to two-thirds of their teaching materials. The Trade Economics and Trade Organization Technology teaching and research groups, in cooperation with the Shenyang Department Store, have also jointly created a form of on-site teaching: "Moving the classroom to the store, taking practice as the teacher." They jointly developed teaching plans, organized students to intern in the store, and during class, the store, from the manager and director to the management team leader, gave lectures to the students and led them to visit the store, teaching them to be salespersons. The teachers in the Industrial Enterprise Teaching and Research Group of the Industrial Economics Department also promptly enriched the teaching with the new experience of workers participating in management, which first appeared in the Mining Machinery Factory. Teachers also compiled the "Chinese Socialist Industrial Economics Teaching Syllabus" based on new developments in practical work. Through two months of social investigation, the teachers also wrote more than 60 papers. After going deep into reality, teachers in various departments of the University of Finance and Economics were able to organize new developments in practical work into teaching in a timely manner, boldly innovate teaching systems, production internships, and teaching methods. Some teachers, after collective research, systematically compiled completely new teaching syllabuses and teaching materials that integrated theory with practice.
    While facing production and going deep into reality, teachers at the Northeast University of Finance and Economics helped factories, enterprises, and stores carry out business reforms and promoted production. For example, the Shenyang Small Switch Factory had long been unable to complete its production plan every month due to unreasonable planning and management, with workers' production always being slack at the beginning and tight at the end of the month. When teachers from the Industrial Economics Department conducted an investigation at the factory, they developed a set of production operation planning system for the factory in light of the factory's specific situation, reversing the long-standing phenomenon of uneven production and greatly improving labor productivity. Several teachers from the Finance and Credit Department, while collecting teaching materials in enterprises, put forward more than 20 rationalization proposals related to business reforms, which were all adopted and implemented by the enterprise departments.
    Now, the socialist great collaboration between the University of Finance and Economics and business departments is moving towards a new stage. The university plans to further consolidate cooperation with higher-level management agencies in the future and expand cooperative relationships to more grassroots units. Next semester, the Department of Agricultural Economics has decided to move the classroom to the nearby agricultural cooperatives, on the one hand to learn from production practice, and on the other hand to help the agricultural cooperatives improve their production, operation, and management.

    提高教学质量　推动生产工作
    拜实际为师一举两得
    东北财经学院同生产部门大协作获得显著成绩
    本报讯　记者曹志贤报道：东北财经学院通过和生产部门的社会主义大协作，教师面向生产，深入实际，调查研究，丰富了教学内容，显著地提高了教学质量，有效地推动了生产部门的业务改革。
    从今年4月起，东北财经学院和沈阳市人民委员会扭成一根绳，展开协作以后，这个学院的工业经济、贸易经济、财政信贷、农业经济和统计等五个系，都根据专业教学的特点和需要，同财经系统和商业系统的领导机关以及专业公司、百货公司、零售商店和批发站等一百多个单位建立了协作关系，同三百多个单位建立了经常的联系。在这个基础上，财经学院的教师走出书斋，深入厂矿，接触实际，调查研究，收集资料，充实教学内容，并经常应邀参加业务部门的有关会议，和业务部门互换资料，交换科学研究成果，有时还拟出教学大纲，请业务部门帮助备课。这学期以来，他们还结合教学请业务部门的负责人，为学生做了四十多次专题报告。在这同时，财经学院师生针对实际工作中的重大问题，和协作单位共同进行了社会调查，并通过举办流动大学、专题讲座等，帮助财经部门的在职干部提高了业务理论水平。
    过去，财经学院教师都是闭门备课，讲授的教材，严重脱离中国的实际生活。学生走上工作岗位以后，还得在实际工作中从头学起。贸易经济系教商业经济和商业组织技术的教师教了好几年课，没有到商业机关去过。学生说贸易经济系的课是三多两少：即外国教材多、原理原则多、条文多；中国教材少，中国实际少。学生觉得学了没用，不爱自己的专业。现在，这个系的教师把实际工作当作提高教学的丰富源泉。下课后，人人走出校门，深入厂矿企业和商店，收集现场最新材料，组织讲稿，编写教材。这个系的贸易组织技术、农产品采购、贸易经济等三个教研组在这个基础上，已经有三分之二的教材增加了实际工作新内容。贸易经济、贸易组织技术两个教研组和沈阳市百货商店在协作过程中，还共同创出了“课堂搬到商店、拜实际为老师”的现场教学形式，他们共同拟出教学计划，组织学生在商店实习，上课时，这个商店从经理、主任直到经营小组长都给学生讲课，并带领学生参观商店，教他们做营业员。工业经济系工业企业教研组的教师还及时把最先出现在矿山机器厂的工人参加管理的新经验充实到教学中去，教师们还根据实际工作的新情况，编写了“中国社会主义工业经济教学大纲”。通过两个月的社会调查，教师们还写出了六十多篇论文。财经学院各系教师在深入实际以后，都能把实际工作中的新情况，及时组织到教学中去，大胆革新教学体系、生产实习和教学方法，有的教师还经过集体研究，系统地编出了全新的理论联系实际的教学大纲和教材。
    东北财经学院教师在面向生产，深入实际的同时，帮助工厂、企业和商店进行了业务改革，促进了生产。如沈阳小型开关厂，长期以来由于计划管理不合理，工人生产总是前松后紧，月月完不成生产计划。工业经济系的教师在这个工厂进行调查时，结合工厂具体情况，为工厂制出了一套生产作业计划制度，扭转了长期以来生产不均衡的现象，大大提高了劳动生产率。财政信贷系有几个教师在深入企业收集教材时，提出了二十多件有关业务改革的合理化建议，都被企业部门采纳和实施。
    现在，财经学院和业务部门的社会主义大协作正在推向新的阶段。学院准备今后进一步巩固与高一级管理机关的协作，更多地把协作关系扩大到基层单位去。农业经济系下学期决定把课堂搬到邻近的农业去社，一方面向生产实际学习，一方面帮助农业社搞好生产经营管理。
