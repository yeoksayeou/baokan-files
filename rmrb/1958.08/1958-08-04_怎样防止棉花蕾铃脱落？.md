How to Prevent Cotton Bud and Boll Shedding?

Now is the peak season for cotton flowering and boll formation. The number of plants per cotton field has been fixed. The number of bolls produced per cotton plant directly affects the unit area yield of the cotton field. If each mu (Chinese acre) has 5,000 plants, and each plant yields an average of 20 mature cotton bolls, the yield per mu can reach 1,000 jin (500 kg) of seed cotton. According to this calculation, if each plant produces one more boll on average, the yield per mu can be increased by 50 jin; if each plant produces one less boll on average, the yield per mu will be reduced by 50 jin. It is evident that protecting buds and bolls, ensuring more boll formation and less shedding, is a decisive factor in increasing cotton production.

Cotton bud and boll shedding is a widespread and serious problem in cotton production. In the past, the shedding rate in general cotton fields was often above 50%, and in severe cases, it reached 80%-90%. The reasons for cotton bud and boll shedding are mainly due to abnormal climatic conditions and cultivation management not meeting the physiological needs of cotton. Insufficient nutrition for buds and bolls or hindered cotton pollination causes abscission layers to form at the base of the bud and boll stalks, eventually leading to shedding. Pest infestation is also a major cause of shedding. In addition, some shedding is due to mechanical damage caused by rough handling during field operations. To protect buds and bolls and reduce shedding, we should take a series of comprehensive measures aimed at the causes of bud and boll shedding. This year, the early growth foundation of cotton is very good. As long as we strengthen pest control, fertilization, and drainage in cotton field management in the later stages, it will have a significant effect on protecting buds and bolls, encouraging more "fu tao" (early autumn bolls), and more "qiu tao" (late autumn bolls).

The so-called cotton "natural shedding" is actually mostly caused by insufficient nutrition or imbalanced nutrient distribution. This year, many cotton-producing areas have greatly increased the application of fertilizer in order to achieve a leap in cotton production, but it now appears that this is still not enough to meet the needs of cotton growth. Many high-yielding fields had sufficient fertilizer in the early stages, resulting in a large number of "ya guo" (axillary fruits), but are now experiencing shrinkage and shedding. This is proof of that. For such cotton fields, we should adopt the method of "small meals, frequent feedings," and promptly topdress and supplement fertilizer for those lacking it, to ensure the nutritional needs of the buds and bolls.

Cotton bud and boll shedding caused by cotton pests during the bud and boll stage often accounts for 40%-50% of the total shedding rate. One cotton bollworm can destroy seven or eight cotton buds and bolls in its lifetime, and in some cases, up to seventeen or eighteen. Plant bugs, pink bollworms, leafhoppers, and other pests can also cause a large amount of cotton bud and boll shedding. The obvious example is in 1957, several large-scale cotton pest control demonstration areas, such as Xinxiang, increased production by 60% by controlling cotton pests. Strengthening pest control in the later stages also has a significant effect on protecting buds and bolls.

The proportion of bud and boll shedding caused by autumn rain and autumn flooding in cotton fields over the years is also considerable. Preparing the drainage system of the cotton field in advance to ensure that the field is dry after the rain stops is a preemptive measure. It is also very important to loosen the soil and cultivate in time after the rain to break the crust and improve the growth conditions of the cotton roots. Cotton earthing-up also has an effect on protecting buds and bolls. According to comparative experiments by Jiangxi Agricultural College, earthing-up reduces shedding by 2.5% compared to no earthing-up. Rainwater accumulating in the flowers can also cause mildew and affect pollination, increasing shedding. Many agricultural cooperatives in Shandong and Hebei provinces also pick off withered flowers after rain, or shake the flower basins after rain to remove accumulated water from newly opened cotton flowers, which is also a way to protect buds and bolls.

Adopting meticulous and localized pruning and using plant growth regulator spraying treatments also has a certain effect on protecting buds and bolls. According to experiments at several points in Hebei and Shanxi provinces in 1957, spraying naphthalene acetic acid two or three times during the peak flowering period can increase production by about 14%. This year, a survey in Yicheng County, Hubei Province, five days after spraying showed that the treated area had 3.5% less shedding than the untreated area.

During field operations, be as careful as possible to avoid any artificial shedding of buds and bolls.

    怎样防止棉花蕾铃脱落？
    现在正是棉花开花结铃盛期，棉田株数已经固定，棉花单株结桃多少，直接影响棉田单位面积产量的高低。以每亩五千株、每株平均收二十个成熟的棉桃计算，亩产就可以达到千斤籽棉。按照这样计算，如果每株平均多收一个桃，亩产量就能提高五十斤；如果每株平均少收一个桃，亩产就减少五十斤。可见保蕾保铃，保证棉花多结桃，少脱落，对棉花增产是一个决定性的因素。
    棉花落蕾落铃是棉花生产上普遍存在的严重问题，过去一般的棉田的脱落率常在50％以上，严重的达到80％—90％。棉花落蕾落铃的原因，主要是由于气候条件异常和栽培管理没有适应棉花生理的需要，蕾铃营养不足或棉花授粉受到阻碍，棉花蕾、铃柄的基部就产生离层，最后脱落下来。受到害虫的侵害，也是形成脱落的一个主要原因。此外，也有一部分脱落是由于进行田间作业时，粗枝大叶造成的机械损伤。为了保蕾保铃，减少脱落，我们就应该针对落蕾落铃的原因，采取一系列的综合性措施。今年棉花前期生育基础很好，今后只要加强后期的治虫、施肥、排涝等棉田管理工作，对保蕾保铃多座伏桃，多结秋桃，都有显著的效果。
    一般所说的棉花“自然脱落”，实际上大部是由于营养不足或养分分配不调和而引起的。今年许多棉区为了使棉花产量有个跃进，已经大量增施了肥料，但是现在看来，还不能满足棉花生长的需要。许多丰产田早期肥分充足，大量出现桠果，现在却产生萎缩脱落现象，这就是证明。对这样的棉田，应该根据棉株生长情况，采取“少吃多餐”的办法，对缺肥的及时追肥补肥，以保证蕾桃养分的需要。
    由于蕾铃期棉虫造成的落蕾落铃，也常占总脱落率的40％—50％。一个棉铃虫一生可以咬毁棉花蕾铃七、八个，多的可以达到十七、八个。盲椿象、红铃虫、叶跳虫等也都能造成棉花蕾铃大量脱落。1957年新乡等几个棉花大面积治虫示范区，防治了棉虫，就增产60％是很明显的例证。加强后期棉虫的防治，对保蕾保铃也有很大作用。
    棉田历年因秋雨、秋涝造成的落蕾落铃的比重也是不小的。事先搞好棉田的排水系统，保证雨住田干，是未雨绸缪的办法。雨后要及时松土中耕，破除板结，改善棉根的生长条件也是很重要的事情。棉花培土，对保蕾保铃也有作用，据江西农学院对比试验，培土比不培土减少脱落2.5％。雨水灌在花里，也会造成霉烂，影响授粉，增加脱落。山东、河北等省许多农业社雨后摘败花，或雨后摇花盆，摆掉新开棉花里的积水，也是保蕾保铃的一个办法。
    采取精细的因地因棵整枝和利用植物生长素喷射处理，对保蕾保铃也有一定效果。据1957年河北、山西等省几个点上试验，在盛花期喷萘乙酸二、三次，可以增产14％左右。今年湖北省宜城县喷射后五天调查，处理的比不处理的减少脱落3.5％。
    在田间作业时，要尽量小心，避免一切人为的落蕾落铃。
