　　Descendants of Gan Jiang
　　——A Record of the Birth of the First Small Blast Furnace in Suzhou
　　Fang Ji
    The mass emergence of small blast furnaces occurred after the Party Central Committee proposed the general line of building socialism. With "simultaneous development of large, medium and small industries," various small blast furnaces, indigenous, foreign, and combining both, sprang up everywhere.

    Suzhou in Jiangsu Province was among the first places to begin building small blast furnaces. But, do readers know how Suzhou's first small blast furnace came about? There's a story behind it.

    "Above, there is heaven; below, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou," as everyone in the country knows. Tiger Hill in Suzhou is a first-class scenic spot. Moreover, Tiger Hill has always had legendary relics such as "Sword Testing Stone" and "Sword Testing Pond." These ancient sites are related to the legend of Gan Jiang, the famous ancient metallurgist, casting swords, which can inspire tourists to have endless imaginations about that ancient metallurgical expert.

    According to the description in Lu Xun's famous novel "Casting the Sword," Gan Jiang's smelting technology was indeed very high.

    Today in Suzhou, there is a lane called "Gan Jiang Lane," said to be where Gan Jiang and his wife Mo Xie lived. Walking straight west from "Gan Jiang Lane," there is a city gate originally called "Craftsman Gate" – later mispronounced, or intentionally changed to "Xiang Gate." And less than ten li outside "Xiang Gate" is Gan Jiang's tomb, and a "Craftsman Gate Pond," which was where Gan Jiang cast his swords.

    After liberation, ancient iron-smelting slag was discovered here. The responsible comrades of the Suzhou Municipal Heavy Industry Bureau also confirmed that for a long time after liberation, the local people were still collecting some ancient furnace bottoms or ores, from which various metals were smelted.

    In this way, the story of Gan Jiang casting swords can still be traced.

    However, two thousand four or five hundred years have passed.

    In the winter of 1956, the supply of pig iron was somewhat tight. The production tasks of the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory were insufficient, and most of the workers and machines were idle, which was very worrying.

    There was a worker in the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory named Zhu Jifa, who was just over thirty years old. One day, he and another worker, Zhou Baoyu, came to Tiger Hill to play, and they stopped by the "Sword Testing Stone." It was a perfectly good stone, about ten feet in diameter, with a neat crack in the middle. The guide said that this was where King Helü of Wu tested the sword after Gan Jiang had cast it. So they thought, what a sharp sword!

    They walked to the "Sword Pond," which was a deep, green body of water, unfathomable. The guide told them that this was the pond where Gan Jiang quenched his swords.

    At this time, Zhu Jifa suddenly thought:

    "Since our ancestors could cast swords here as far back as two thousand years ago, can't we even smelt pig iron?"

    This thought was all it took; it immediately gave rise to an ambitious idea in his mind—smelting iron! Yes, smelting iron!

    So he told his idea to his companion, Zhou Baoyu. Zhou Baoyu was immediately attracted to his fresh idea. The two of them didn't bother to enjoy the scenery, and immediately ran back to inquire everywhere about where there were iron mines.

    There were iron mines, not far southwest of Suzhou in Yangshan. But to smelt iron, what method could be used to turn ore into iron?

    The tight supply of pig iron was something the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee had also sensed long ago. So, after hearing that there was still indigenous iron-smelting in Ebian, Sichuan, the Provincial Party Committee decided to form a visiting group to take a look.

    Zhu Jifa was assigned to participate in this visiting group. But the engineer surnamed Pan, who led the visiting group, did not believe in indigenous iron-smelting at all. They trekked through mountains and rivers to Ebian, Sichuan. Looking at these iron-smelting furnaces, they were indeed very "indigenous" and very simple. They were just small furnaces built on the hillside with bricks and clay; using the slope of the mountain, they built a springboard to feed the furnace.

    In this way, they smelted pig iron. As for how long this method of smelting iron had been passed down, even they didn't know.

    Needless to say, the engineer surnamed Pan did not approve of this method at all, first because it was unscientific, and second because it was too dangerous…

    But in Zhu Jifa's mind, it produced a different reaction: Smelting iron, so that's how it's done!

    He had a bottom line in his heart.

    Seeing indigenous iron-smelting was not all; another miracle was discovered here, which strengthened Zhu Jifa's confidence even more.

    It turned out that he saw that the people of Ebian not only smelted iron using indigenous methods, but also smelted steel using indigenous methods. They would heat the iron ingots they had smelted themselves, and then forge them on an anvil with thousands of hammer blows, until they became a pure steel with extremely high hardness.

    This kind of steel was called "Su Steel."

    "Su Steel?" Zhu Jifa thought very strangely: "Why is it called Su Steel?"

    People replied to him: Because this method of steelmaking was passed down from Suzhou in ancient times.

    Zhu Jifa was simply overjoyed—it turned out that the inspiration he had received from Gan Jiang was not only in legends, but also in real life!

    All of this left a deep impression on worker Zhu Jifa and the deep emotion it stirred became a driving force for the working class to carry out labor creation. But for the bourgeois intellectual—that engineer surnamed Pan—it was a completely different matter. After returning from the visit, he denied the value of indigenous iron-smelting and did not allow the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory to smelt iron according to the Sichuan method.

    Of course, Zhu Jifa did not listen to him, and would not listen to him. After returning to Suzhou, Zhu Jifa reported to the leadership and put forward his own opinions, requesting that a indigenous blast furnace be built immediately. This blast furnace was very small, only 0.9 cubic meters. The leadership immediately adopted his opinion and strongly supported it.

    So, in January 1957, the first small blast furnace was built in the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory.

    This small blast furnace was built on the basis of the factory's past iron-melting furnace. The shell was a gasoline drum, and there were no bricks inside, only a thick layer of clay.

    In this way, the first furnace of iron in modern history in Suzhou was smelted.

    But at the same time, the furnace also melted.

    The second time, they used refractory bricks to build the furnace. Due to lack of experience, it was not well built, and fire was coming out everywhere. After smelting one furnace, it stopped again.

    There was success, there was failure; there was experience, there were lessons. But on the basis of such step-by-step experiments, they finally built a blast furnace of eight cubic meters. This blast furnace produced one furnace of iron every three hours, and each furnace could produce twelve tons of iron.

    Unexpectedly, they received many visitors. Including visiting groups from large and famous steel bases like Anshan Iron and Steel.

    Now, the original small blast furnace no longer exists, but next to it stands an eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace and two fifteen-cubic-meter small blast furnaces. The blast furnace is producing iron, and the factory director said that in order to cope with the people who come to visit, they plan to restore the first small blast furnace; but only as a model. Their current interest lies in larger blast furnaces and new open-hearth furnaces. He said, "Suzhou should have heavy industry. Why can't we have it? We have mines, we have workers… Since in ancient times, our ancestors could smelt Su Steel and cast world-famous swords! We must surpass the ancients and surpass our ancestors to be worthy of being descendants of Gan Jiang."

　　干将的后裔
　　——记苏州第一座小高炉的诞生
　　方纪
    小高炉的大量出现，是在党中央提出建设社会主义总路线以后。“大中小型工业同时并举”，于是土的、洋的、土洋兼施的、各式各样的小高炉，一座座到处树立起来了。
    江苏省的苏州，便是最早着手建设小高炉的地方。但是，读者知道苏州的第一座小高炉是如何出现的吗？这里面有一段故事。
    “上有天堂，下有苏杭”，全国人人知晓。苏州有座虎丘山，更是天下一等名胜。加以在虎丘山上，从来就有“剑池”、“试剑石”，这样一些带有传奇性的遗迹名胜。这些古迹，都与古代名冶匠干将铸剑的传说有关，很可以供游览的人对那位古代的冶金专家生出无限的想像。
    据鲁迅先生的著名小说“铸剑”里的描述，干将的冶炼技术，确是非常之高的。
    现在苏州留下来的，有一条巷子，叫做“干将坊”，据说当时干将同他的妻子莫邪便住在那里。走出“干将坊”对直向西，有一座城门原叫“匠门”——以后被叫讹了，或者被有意地改成了“相门”。而在“相门”外面不上十里路有干将的墓，还有一个“匠门塘”，便是干将铸剑的所在。
    解放以后，在这里曾经发现过古代炼铁的炉渣。苏州市重工业局的负责同志也证实，解放以后很长一段时间里，当地群众还是在搜罗一些古代的炉底或矿石，从中炼出各种金属来。
    照这样看来，干将铸剑的事，还是有线索可寻的。
    但是，二千四五百年过去了。
    1956年冬季，生铁的供应有些紧张。苏州农业机器厂生产任务不足，工人机器，大半闲起来，很是着急。
    苏州农业机器厂有个工人叫朱纪发，年纪不过三十刚过。有一天，他和另一个工人周宝玉到虎丘来玩，他们在“试剑石”旁边站住了。好端端的一块石头，方圆也有丈来大，中间齐斩斩地裂了一条缝。导游的人说，这是干将铸好了剑，吴王阖闾在这块石头上试剑的。于是他们心里想，好锋利的剑呵！
    又走到“剑池”旁边，是一泓深邃碧绿的水，深不见底。导游的人又对他们说，这是干将铸剑时，淬火的池子。
    这时，朱纪发忽然想道：
    “既然远在二千多年以前，我们的祖先能在这里铸剑，我们便连生铁也炼不出来么？”
    他这一想，不要紧，立刻在他心里生出了一种雄心勃勃的念头——炼铁！对，炼铁！
    于是他把这个想法告诉了他的同伴周宝玉。周宝玉也立刻为他的这种新鲜念头吸引住了。两个人顾不得游山玩水，立刻跑回去，到处打听哪里有铁矿。
    铁矿是有的，就在苏州西南不远的阳山。但是炼铁，用什么方法能把矿石炼成铁呢？
    生铁供应紧张，江苏省委也早感觉到了。于是省委在听说了四川峨边民间还有土法炼铁存在以后，便决定组成一个参观团去看看。
    朱纪发被派参加了这个参观团。但领导这个参观团的一个姓潘的工程师，却根本不相信什么土法炼铁的事。跋山涉水，到了四川峨边。看看这些炼铁炉，确是非常“土”，非常简单。就是一座座的用砖和粘土砌成的小炉子，建筑在山坡上；利用山的斜坡，搭一块跳板，往炉里送料。
    就这样，他们炼出来生铁。至于这样的炼铁方法，连他们也不知道已经流传了多少年代。
    不用说，姓潘的工程师根本不赞成这种方法，第一不科学，第二太危险……
    但是在朱纪发心里，却产生了不同的反应：炼铁，原来就这样！
    他心里有了底。
    看到了土法炼铁，这还不算；在这里还发现了另外一桩奇迹，这使得朱纪发的信心更加增强了。
    原来他看到峨边的人民，不但用土法炼铁，还用土法炼钢。就是把他们自己炼出的铁块，烧红了，放在铁砧上，千锤百炼地锻打，直到成为一种硬度极高的纯钢。
    这种钢名字，就叫做“苏钢”。
    “苏钢？”朱纪发非常奇怪的想：“为什么叫苏钢？”
    人们回答他：因为这种炼钢方法，是在古代由苏州传来的。
    朱纪发简直是喜出望外——原来他从干将那里得到的启发，不仅是在传说里，而且也在现实生活之中！
    这一切在工人朱纪发心里留下了深刻的印象，受到了深刻感动的事，成了促进工人阶级进行劳动创造的一种动力。但是对于资产阶级的知识分子——那个姓潘的工程师，却完全是另外一回事。参观回来之后，他否定土法炼铁的价值，并且不准许苏州农业机器厂按照四川的方法炼铁。
    当然朱纪发并没有听他的话，也不会听他的话，朱纪发回到苏州，给领导汇报以后，提出了自己的意见，要求立即动手建一座土高炉，这座高炉很小，小到只有零点九立方公尺。领导上立刻采纳了他的意见，并且大力加以支持。
    于是1957年1月，第一座小高炉，在苏州农业机器厂建立起来了。
    这座小高炉是在过去厂里化铁炉的基础上建立的，壳子是汽油筒，里面连砖也没有，只糊了一层厚厚的粘土。
    就这样，苏州近代历史上的第一炉铁炼出来了。
    但是同时，炉子也烧化了。
    第二次，他们使用了耐火砖砌炉。由于没有经验，砌得不好，四处冒火，炼了一炉，又停了。
    这里面有成功，有失败；有经验，有教训。但他们就在这样一步一步试验的基础上，最后建成了一座八立方公尺的高炉。这座高炉每三小时出一炉铁，每炉可出铁十二吨。
    他们意想不到地接待了许多来参观的人。其中包括像鞍钢这样大、这样有名的钢铁基地派来的参观团。
    现在，最初的那座小高炉已经不存在了，但在它旁边，站着一座八立方公尺的、两座十五立公尺的小高炉。高炉正在出铁，厂长说，为了应付来参观的人，他们打算把第一座小高炉恢复起来；但只是做为一个模型。他们现在的兴趣在更大的高炉和新的平炉上。他说，“苏州应该有重工业。为什么不能有呢？我们有矿，有工人……既然在古代，我们的祖先就能炼出苏钢，铸成名闻天下的宝剑！我们要胜过古人，胜过我们的祖先，才称得起是干将的子孙。”
