　　We Fought Together Long Ago
　　By Our Correspondent Yang Yi
　　In 1930, when the Chinese revolution was still in a difficult period, and the Chinese Communist Party was struggling arduously to establish a red regime, Czechoslovakia was also under the cruel rule of the bourgeoisie. On the evening of October 18th of that year, in a small town in the Nová Boleslav region of the Prague province, the workers' amateur cultural club performed a nine-act play called "Burning China" in the simple theater of the "Workers' House."
　　The gist of the plot was:
　　"Beneath Hroumka Mountain in the Nová Boleslav region lives a group of impoverished workers. They live in dilapidated shacks and endure exploitation and bullying like people in a colony, so they call themselves 'Moroccans.' They firmly stand in the ranks of the proletarian revolution, determined to eliminate poverty in the world and plant their red flag all over the world. When they learn about the Chinese revolution, they decide to go and help the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army defeat Chiang Kai-shek. Led by a worker named Zeman, they set off. After overcoming numerous difficulties, they finally arrive in China, see and participate in the heroic struggle of the Chinese proletariat, establish their own merits, and capture a Kuomintang general. Finally, the 'Moroccan' team returns triumphantly and is warmly welcomed by the villagers. The whole play ends with Zeman's speech at the welcoming ceremony. He points out that the working class and poor peasants of China, the world's largest country, firmly believe that their just cause will surely triumph and will establish the world's second proletarian motherland. In his concluding remarks, Zeman also talks about the world significance of the Chinese revolution and the necessity of assisting the revolutionary workers of China. He says that the goal of the 'Moroccans' is to make the red flag of the working class victory wave from the Yellow Sea to the Atlantic, and then from the Atlantic through New York to the Yellow Sea."
　　This is a story intertwined with the deep friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples, and it is also a story that fully demonstrates the internationalist spirit of the Czechoslovak working class. The fact that it happened almost thirty years ago makes it even more moving. Not long ago, this reporter went to the Nová Boleslav region and specifically visited several old workers who were still alive and had participated in the performance at that time.
　　I met five old Bolsheviks: textile worker Comrade Virler, who was in charge of Party work at the time; automobile factory worker Comrade Dubsky, who was the director and composer of the play "Burning China"; female worker Comrade Mara, who was responsible for prompting during the performance; the relatively younger Comrade Kedler, who played a "volunteer" from the "Moroccans" in the play; and seventy-seven-year-old carpenter Comrade Chakravsky, who had also met the revolutionary teacher Lenin in Switzerland.
　　We talked cordially about the historical background of the "script" and the process of the performance, and we were all immersed in the memories of thirty years ago.
　　In Czechoslovakia after the First World War, the bourgeoisie usurped state power. After the founding of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1921, it vigorously carried out political work among the masses, striving for the victory of the national revolution, and also devoted itself to the struggle of the international communist movement. The Nová Boleslav CPC County Committee often sent instructors to explain the international situation to the workers based on the materials issued by the Party Central Committee. Each time, they talked about Asia, especially emphasizing the Chinese revolution, because they knew that the rise of this Chinese dragon would generate endless power. In 1925, the "International Workers' Aid Society" under the leadership of the CPC held mass rallies in thirty-four towns and cities across the country from July 31st to August 17th. The only agenda of the meetings was "the liberation struggle of the Chinese workers and peasants." They invited a "representative of the fighting Chinese people" to speak at the meeting and collected donations for Chinese workers' organizations on the spot. Comrade Virler was the chairman of the Nová Boleslav region's "International Workers' Aid Society" at the time, and Comrade Dubsky was the accountant.
　　"Burning China" was created in such an objective situation, based on the real life of the workers in the Nová Boleslav region. This script can be said to be a combination of revolutionary romanticism and realism. The "Moroccans" in the play actually existed, and many plots are based on facts, but there are also many purely bold imaginations. The playwright, Comrade Bukovsky, was a worker and a member of the CPC County Committee at the time. He knew more about the international situation and was quite good at writing. Unfortunately, he passed away in 1953, depriving us of the opportunity to meet this proletarian fighter who held deep feelings for the Chinese people.
　　In early 1930, Bukovsky and Dubsky worked together. At that time, the bourgeois newspapers wantonly slandered the Chinese revolution, calling the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army "bandits" and "the Yellow Peril." One day, when they were talking about this issue, they felt it necessary to explain the truth of the Chinese revolution to the workers and to emphasize the importance of the unity of the international working class. Subsequently, Bukovsky wrote this script. At that time, the workers in the Nová Boleslav region had an amateur theater troupe. They collectively discussed the script, adopted the playwright's ideas and main plot, and also made some modifications.
　　In the environment at that time, it was not an easy task for the workers to perform such a script. They had no experience, no money, and the script had to pass the harsh review of the reactionary authorities before it could be performed. But the desire to promote the Chinese revolution and help the Chinese workers overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries encouraged them. They were very enthusiastic and determined to overcome all difficulties and bring the play to the stage to meet the audience. All the work related to the performance was voluntarily undertaken by the workers. Many actors were on stage for the first time, including the worker who played the protagonist Zeman. The workers donated money to prepare props and make scenery, and many people donated all they had. In order to pass the county government's review, they waited for many days. Fortunately, the confused censor only deleted the merciless satire of the county magistrate and the two paragraphs he considered the most inflammatory, which did not have much impact. Before the performance, the "Moroccans" widely publicized the content of the play and sold tickets in the factories. The workers were very welcome, and all the tickets were immediately sold out.
　　On the day "Burning China" was staged, the county police bureau was heavily guarded, as if facing a formidable enemy, and a censor was specially sent to sit in the theater to monitor. But the performance was very successful, and the audience was very enthusiastic. The play not only showed the militant friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples, and the fearless spirit of the working class to manage the world, but also combined with the actual situation of local workers opposing wage cuts, and put forward the demand for increased wages, cooperating with the workers' struggle.
　　Although the play was only allowed to be performed once, it had played a certain role in the internationalist education of the workers. In those days, the workers were talking about the content of the play, and the Party organization also used this opportunity to carry out education for Party members and unity work for non-Party workers, because many non-Party workers also participated in the performance of the script.
　　This spark ignited by advanced workers continued to burn in the difficult years that followed. On April 30, 1932, another play depicting the life of Chinese workers, "Shanghai," was staged in Nová Boleslav. In addition, in this county, we also saw a mimeographed newspaper for Party cadres to read in 1937, which detailed the course of the Battle of Pingxingguan and also printed a map of North China at that time.
　　Unfortunately, the "Burning China" script that can be found now is not complete, missing three acts. Now the Nová Boleslav CPC County Committee has issued a notice requiring all people related to the performance at that time to recall the performance through various means and fill in the missing parts. The County Committee is also considering handing over the supplemented script to the county theater for re-performance after sorting it out.
　　Time flew by quickly in the conversation, but these old comrades still enthusiastically invited us to visit the past "Workers' House" and pay homage to the theater where the performance was held. This is a rectangular house that can accommodate hundreds of people. Comrade Virler said meaningfully: "Our next performance will be in the county theater instead of this room." Yes, times have changed, and everything has changed. The bold ideals of thirty years ago have become the reality of life. The "Moroccans" who used to live in the hills have become the masters of the country and have moved from shacks to newly built buildings; and the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, which they yearned for and supported at that time, has achieved a complete victory.
　　Before parting, they repeatedly stated that they were willing to see the performance of "Burning China" again, wishing the Chinese people to know that they had performed and will perform this script, and hoping that the Chinese people would know that the workers of Nová Boleslav region were, are, and will always stand with them.
　　I accepted their entrustment with deep respect, and with irrepressible excitement, I conveyed the wishes of these Czech old workers tens of thousands of miles away to my dear compatriots. (Attached picture)

　　我们早就在一起战斗过
　　本报记者　杨翊
    1930年，在中国革命还处于困难时期，中国共产党正为建立红色政权而艰苦斗争的时候，当时的捷克斯洛伐克也还在资产阶级残酷统治之下。就在那年10月18日的晚上，在布拉格州所属新波勒斯拉夫县的小县城中，工人业余文化俱乐部在“工人之家”的简陋剧场里，演出了一个名为“燃烧着的中国”的九幕话剧。
    剧情的梗概是：
    “新波勒斯拉夫县的赫鲁姆山下，住着一群穷困的工人，他们住的是破旧的茅棚，过着像殖民地人民一样受尽剥削和欺凌的生活，因而自称‘摩洛哥人’。他们坚定地站在无产阶级革命的行列中，决心扫除人间的贫困，在全世界插上自己的红旗。当他们获悉中国革命的消息后，就决心前往帮助中国工农红军击溃蒋介石。他们在一个名叫泽曼的工人领导下出发了。突破了层层困难之后，他们终于到达中国，看到了并且参加了中国无产阶级的英勇斗争，自己也建立了功勋，俘虏了国民党的将军。最后，‘摩洛哥人’的队伍凯旋归来，受到乡亲们的热情欢迎。全剧是以泽曼在欢迎会上的讲话来结束的。他指出，中国这一世界上最大国家的工人阶级和贫农，深信自己的正义事业必然胜利，将要建立世界上第二个无产阶级的祖国。泽曼在他的结束语中也谈到中国革命的世界意义，谈到援助中国革命工人的必要。他说，‘摩洛哥人’的目标是使从黄海到大西洋，再从大西洋经过纽约到黄海，到处都招展着工人阶级胜利的红旗。”
    这是交炽着中捷两国人民深厚友情的故事，也是充分表现捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级国际主义精神的故事。事情发生在差不多三十年以前就更加令人感动。不久前，记者到了新波勒斯拉夫县，特地访问了几位仍健在的参与当时演出工作的老工人。
    我会见了五位老布尔什维克：纺织工人维尔勒同志，他当时担任党的工作；汽车厂工人杜布斯基同志，他是剧本“燃烧着的中国”的导演和作曲者；女工玛拉同志，她在演出时负责提词；比较年轻的克德勒同志在剧中扮演一个“摩洛哥人”的“志愿军”；七十七岁的老木工查克拉夫斯基同志，还曾在瑞士会见过革命导师列宁。
    我们亲切地谈论着“剧本”的时代背景和演出的经过，我们都沉浸在三十年前往事的回忆中了。
    第一次世界大战后的捷克斯洛伐克，资产阶级篡夺了国家政权。捷克斯洛伐克共产党自1921年成立后，即大力在群众中开展政治工作，争取本国人民革命的胜利，也致力于国际共产主义运动的斗争。新波勒斯拉夫捷共县委会就经常根据党中央发下的材料，派出指导员向工人们讲解国际形势，每次都谈到亚洲，特别是着重宣扬中国革命，因为他们知道，中国这条巨龙飞腾起来将会产生无穷无尽的力量。1925年，捷共领导下的“国际工人援助会”，曾自7月31日到8月17日在全国三十四个城镇举行群众集会，会议的唯一议程是“中国工农的解放斗争”，他们邀请了一位“战斗的中国人民的代表”在会上讲话，并当场为中国工人组织募捐。维尔勒同志当时就是新波勒斯拉夫县“国际工人援助会”的主席，杜布斯基同志是会计。
    “燃烧着的中国”就是在这样的客观形势下，以新波勒斯拉夫县工人的现实生活为背景创作出来的。这个剧本可以说是革命的浪漫主义和现实主义的结合。剧中的“摩洛哥人”就确有其事，不少情节都有事实为依据，但也有许多纯粹是大胆的想像。编剧的布柯夫斯基同志是一位工人，也是当时捷共县委委员，他了解国际形势较多，也颇能写作。不幸他已于1953年病逝，使我们没有机会会晤这位对中国人民怀抱着深厚感情的无产阶级战士。
    1930年初，布柯夫斯基和杜布斯基在一块工作。那时，资产阶级的报刊肆意诬蔑中国革命，把工农红军说成是“土匪”，是“黄祸”。有一天他们在谈到这个问题的时候，觉得有必要向工人们说明中国革命的真相，有必要强调国际工人阶级团结的重要性。随后，布柯夫斯基就写出了这个剧本。当时新波勒斯拉夫县的工人们有个业余剧团，他们集体讨论了剧本，采用了剧作者的思想和主要情节，也作了某些修改。
    在当时的环境下，工人们要演出像这样的剧本并不是一件轻而易举的事。他们没有经验，没有钱，同时剧本要演出还得通过反动当局的苛刻审查。但是宣扬中国革命、帮助中国工人打倒国民党反动派的意愿鼓舞着他们，他们热情很高，决心克服一切困难，把戏搬上舞台同观众见面。有关演出的一切工作都是由工人们自告奋勇来担任的，许多演员是第一次登台，连扮演主角泽曼的工人也不例外。工人们自己捐钱制备道具，做布景，不少人倾囊捐输。为了通过县政府的审查，他们等待了许多日子，好在糊涂的审查官仅只删掉那无情嘲讽县长大人以及他认为最富于煽动性的两段，影响还不大。演出前，“摩洛哥人”在工厂中广泛宣传了戏的内容并推销戏票，工人们非常欢迎，所有戏票都被立刻分光。
    “燃烧着的中国”上演的那天，县警察局戒备森严，如临大敌，还特地派了个检查官坐在剧场监视。但演出的结果很成功，观众情绪非常热烈。这个戏不但表现了中捷两国人民的战斗友谊，表现了工人阶级要管理世界的大无畏气概，而且还结合本地工人正在反对减低工资的实际情况，提出了增加工资的要求，配合了工人们的斗争。
    这个戏虽只获准演出一场，但是对工人们进行的国际主义教育已经起了一定的作用。那些天工人们都谈论着戏的内容，党组织也利用这一机会，开展了对党员的教育和对非党工人的团结工作，因为那次有不少非党工人也参加了剧本的演出工作。
    这颗由先进工人点起的火种，在以后艰难的岁月里仍继续燃烧着。1932年4月30日，另一个描写中国工人生活的剧本“上海”又在新波勒斯拉夫上演了。另外，在这个县里，我们还看到一张1937年供党内干部阅读的油印小报，上面详细刊载了平型关战役的经过，还印制了当时的华北地图。
    可惜的是，目前所能找到的“燃烧着的中国”的剧本不够齐全，内中缺少三幕。现在新波勒斯拉夫捷共县委会已发出通知，要求所有与当时演出有关的人，通过各种办法来回忆演出情况，把残缺部分补足。县委会还考虑把补充了的剧本交县剧院整理后，再度进行公演。
    时间在谈话中飞速滑过去了，但是这几位老同志还是热情地邀请我们参观了过去的“工人之家”，瞻仰了当时演出的剧场。这是一间长方形的房子，约可容纳数百人。维尔勒同志意味深长地说：“我们下次演出将在县剧院而不在这个房间了。”是的，时代不同了，一切也都改变了，三十年前的大胆的理想已经成为生活的真实。昔日困居山坡的“摩洛哥人”已成为国家的主人，从茅棚里迁往新建的楼房中了；而他们当时所向往和支援的中国人民的革命斗争，则已经取得了彻底的胜利。
    分手前，他们都一再说明愿意能再一次看到“燃烧着的中国”的演出，愿望中国人民知道他们演出过并且还要演出这个剧本，希望中国人民知道新波勒斯拉夫县的工人过去是、现在是、将来也还是同他们站在一起的。
    我怀着深深的敬意接受了他们的嘱托，并怀着难以抑制的激动心情向亲爱的祖国同胞，转达数万里外的这几位捷克斯洛伐克老工人的心愿。（附图片）
