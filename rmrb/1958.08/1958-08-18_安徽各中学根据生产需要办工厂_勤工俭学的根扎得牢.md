Turning Factories and Farms into Living Classrooms

　　Anhui Middle Schools Run Factories According to Production Needs
　　The Roots of Work-Study Programs are Firmly Planted

　　(This dispatch) According to our newspaper, middle schools in Anhui Province are vigorously establishing factories as part of their work-study programs, closely integrating education with labor production, and have already achieved significant results.

　　Students in Anhui Province's middle schools were already accustomed to participating in physical labor in their spare time; since the beginning of the spring semester this year, schools have further developed work-study activities centered on industrial and agricultural production. Based on the characteristics and needs of local production, schools are providing multifaceted services for industrial and agricultural production, setting off a surge in the establishment of factories and farms. To date, schools have built or are building more than 100 small blast furnaces for iron smelting, with an annual iron production capacity of more than 60,000 tons. There are approximately 160 granular fertilizer factories, bacterial fertilizer factories, and farm tool factories. There are 54 stationery and teaching tool factories, and hundreds of other factories. These factories are the students' production grounds and also classrooms. In this way, students not only consolidate the knowledge they learn from books but also gradually establish a labor concept and master production technology. For example, at Bengbu No. 3 Middle School, general students have learned techniques such as casting, fitter work, and lathe work, and a few students have reached the level of third-grade skilled workers.

　　In the process of running factories, schools have adopted teaching methods that combine theory and practice, fully utilizing the students' wisdom, and ushering in a situation of vigorously carrying out technological revolution. Currently, there are more than 40 new creations and inventions and trial-produced new products, strongly supporting industrial and agricultural production.

　　Bengbu No. 4 Middle School has produced a hand-cranked granular fertilizer machine, which increases work efficiency by 40 to 50 times compared to using old tools. The school also uses human urine to replace ammonium sulfate, solving the difficulties in producing granular fertilizer. Wuhu No. 7 Middle School has successfully used indigenous methods to produce coke, with a coke yield of 70%. Linquan Normal School has produced simple amplifiers, each costing only five yuan, and plans to produce 300 units for use in rural areas.

　　Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, schools run factories by implementing the principles of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and solving problems such as supply, production, and sales. Generally, schools utilize the equipment of physics and chemistry laboratories, purchase some old machines, or borrow and self-manufacture machines, and teachers and students build factory buildings themselves. When Bengbu No. 5 Middle School was establishing its factory, it had no factory buildings or equipment, but they first sent students to machinery factories to learn technology, and then borrowed machines from the factory for production, accumulating funds. Now, they have purchased their own lathes and established a machinery factory to start producing motors. Some schools also use funds raised by teachers and students and saved expenses to run factories or prepare for larger factories, while some are funded by the government or take out loans from banks. Generally, factories start with handicrafts, accumulate funds, and then gradually develop into semi-mechanization and mechanization. Some schools select teachers and students to go to factories to learn technology and factory management, some schools invite workers to teach technology at the school, and some schools cooperate with factories. This solves the technical problems in running factories and production. (Qin Yuzhen)

### 安徽各中学根据生产需要办工厂　勤工俭学的根扎得牢

    把工厂农场变成活的课堂
　　安徽各中学根据生产需要办工厂
　　勤工俭学的根扎得牢
    本报讯　安徽省中学在勤工俭学中大办工厂，使教育和劳动生产紧密结合起来，现已获得显著成绩。
    安徽省中学学生，过去在课余参加体力劳动已有习惯；今年春季开学以来，各校又进一步开展了以工农业生产为主的勤工俭学活动。各校根据当地生产的特点和需要，多方面地为工农业生产服务，掀起了办工厂和农场的热潮。到目前为止，各校已建成或正在兴建的炼铁小高炉有一百多座，每年产铁可达六万多吨。颗粒肥料厂、细菌肥料厂、农具厂一百六十个左右。文具和教具厂五十四个，其他工厂数百个。这些工厂是学生生产的园地，也是课堂。这样，既巩固了学生在书本上学到的知识，又使学生逐步树立了劳动观念，掌握了生产技术。如蚌埠三中，一般的学生都学会了铸工、钳工、车工等技术，有少数学生已达到三级技术工人的水平。
    在办工厂的过程中，各校采用了理论和实践相结合的教学方法，充分发挥了学生的智慧，出现了大闹技术革命的局面。目前已有四十多种新的创造发明和试制的新产品，有力地支援了工农业生产。
    蚌埠四中制成手摇颗粒肥料机，比用旧的工具提高工作效率四十到五十倍，该校还用人尿代替硫酸铵、解决了制颗粒肥料的困难。芜湖七中用土法炼焦获得成功，出焦率达70％。临泉师范制成简易扩音器，每只成本仅五元，计划生产三百部，供应农村使用。
    各校办工厂，在各级党委领导下，贯彻了多快好省的原则，并解决了供产销等问题。一般的学校都是利用理化试验室的设备，再购买一些旧机器，或者借用和自制机器，师生自己修砌厂房。蚌埠五中办工厂时，无厂房、无设备，但他们先派学生到机械厂学习技术，继而借用厂里的机器进行生产，积累资金，现在，已经自购车床，建立了机械厂开始生产马达。有的学校还用师生集资、节约的经费办工厂或筹备较大的工厂，有的由政府投资或向银行贷款。一般工厂都是先从手工业开始，积累资金后，再逐步发展到半机械化、机械化。有些学校选派教师、学生进工厂学习技术和工厂管理，有的学校请工人来校教技术，还有些学校和工厂协作。这样就解决了办工厂和生产中的技术问题。　　　　　　（秦聿震）
