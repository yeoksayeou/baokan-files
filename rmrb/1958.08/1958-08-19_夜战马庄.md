　　Night Battle at Mazhuang
　　Xu Honglie
　　On the evening of August 6th, I arrived at Mazhuang Town, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, where the entire township's work on the production and installation of ball bearings is concentrated.
　　Along a long east-west street, the lights were bright, and the hammering was constant, just as the local farmers described it: "Looking east, two rows of lights, the sound of hammers louder than thunder!" If it weren't for the stars winking in the sky, and the houses on both sides of the street, you would think this was a factory workshop. Surrounding the kerosene lamps were barbers, shop assistants, government officials, and students, all hammering beads. Under the gas lamps were all agricultural cooperative members. In the "work area" of the Ninth Agricultural Cooperative at the west end of the street, the farmers' skilled techniques attracted me. A section of iron bar was transformed into a nearly spherical blank with a few strokes of their hammers, and after being placed on a steel mold and hammered for a while, round and shiny beads came out. A child took out twenty or so beads from his pocket and showed them to me, saying boastfully, "I made all of these tonight!" In the beginning, each of them could only make a few beads a day, mostly rejects, but now they can generally make more than a hundred, and some even make one hundred and fifty or sixty.
　　In a quiet courtyard with the front and back doors tightly closed, the members of the trial production team were working intensely. The township party secretary and I called at the door for a long time before someone came out to open it. In an empty room with a kerosene lamp lit, five people were gathered on the ground, putting beads on several large bearings. It was already two o'clock in the morning, and the weather was very cool, but they were all sweating profusely. After putting on the beads, they tried to turn them on the ground, but it wasn't flexible, so they took them off and replaced them with others. If you couldn't install them, someone else would take over. Guo Wunjiao, the young worker who created this set of ball bearings, and Master Qiu, who was over forty years old. Together, they had created several tools for factories and agricultural cooperatives, such as hand saws and large weeders, and in the past few days, they had created four or five kinds of large vehicle bearings. Right now, they were trying to make a ball bearing they had just created that day, which, in addition to the inner and outer shells, also had a clip in the middle to fix the position of the beads. It was said that if the trial production was successful, it could replace imported goods worth nearly one hundred yuan a set.
　　In a field at the south end of Mazhuang Town, bulldozers with ball bearings already installed were neatly arranged, and bulldozers that had not yet been installed were scattered around. Under the brightly lit gas lamps, twenty or thirty old and new carpenters, in groups of two, were busily removing old axles and installing new ones.
　　"Are the ball bearings good to use?" I asked an old man with gray hair.
　　"The path pointed out by the Party is good for us. The double-shared plow was modified the day before yesterday, and the millstone was modified yesterday, and they are much lighter than before. Today, we will finish installing the bulldozers, which will be useful for repairing canals and delivering fertilizer!" At this moment, a cooperative member pulled me to a bulldozer that had been installed, asking me to turn one over, while he himself turned over one that had not been installed, and asked me and him to turn the wheels of the two vehicles separately. After turning them the same amount, his wheel had already stopped turning, while my wheel was still spinning rapidly. He said to me, "What do you think?!" At this point, I realized that he had pulled me here to answer my question with facts.
　　In this boiling night, it was already three o'clock in the morning without realizing it. The township party secretary not only did not go to rest, but also started new work, convening a "cock-crowing meeting" of cadres to discuss how to strive to achieve the ball bearingization of all operating tools before the time stipulated by the county party committee, and win the first "ization" red flag in the county.

　　夜战马庄
　　徐洪烈
    8月6日傍晚，我来到陕西咸阳县马庄镇，全乡生产、安装滚珠轴承的工作集中在这里。
    在一条东西方向的长街上，灯火辉煌，锤声叮当，真像当地农民形容的那样：“往东一看两行灯，铁锤响的赛雷声”！如果不是天上的星星眨眼，不是两旁的街房，你会把这里当成工厂的生产车间。围在马灯、煤油灯底下砸珠子的是理发员、营业员、机关干部和学生。在汽灯底下的全是农业社员。在街西头第九农业社的“工区”，农民们熟练的技术吸引住了我。一节铁条在他们的铁锤下面，几下就变成了接近球形的坯子，再放在钢模子上打一阵，又圆又光的珠子就出来了。一个孩子从他的衣袋里摸出二十多颗珠子给我看，带着夸耀的口气说：“这都是我今天晚上打的！”开始，他们每个人一天只能打几颗，大多还是废品，现在一般都能打一百多颗，还有打一百五六十颗的。
    在一个前门后门关得死死的宁静的院子里，试制小组的成员在紧张的工作着。该乡党委书记和我叫了半天门，才出来一个人开门。在一间空房子里点着一盏煤油灯，五个人围在地上，给几个大轴承上珠子。已经午夜两点，天气很凉爽，但他们每人还是全身流汗。装上珠子，在地上试转，不灵活，取下来另换几颗。你装不成，别人又接过去装。创造这套滚珠轴承的郭文教是青年工人，丘师傅已四十多岁了。他们一起合作，曾给工厂和农业社创造了好几种工具，像手摇锯、大耘锄等，最近几天又搞成四、五种大车轴承。现在，正在试制的是他们当天才创造的一种滚珠轴承，除了内外套，中间还有一个固定珠子位置的夹页，据说试制成功后能顶上近百元一套的进口货。
    在马庄镇南头的一块场地上，整齐的排列着安装好滚珠轴承的推土车，没有安装的推土车散放在四周。在照得四围通亮的汽灯底下，二、三十个新老木匠，两个人一组，紧张的在卸着旧轴，安装着新轴。
    “安上滚珠好使吗？”我问一个头发斑白的老人。
    “党给咱指的路就是好，前天改完了双铧犁，昨天改完磨子，都比原来轻多了，今天就要装完土车子，修渠送粪都用得着它！”正在这时，一个社员把我拉到安装好的推土车旁边，要我翻过一辆，他自己却把没安装的也翻过一辆，并要我和他分别转动两个车的轮子。同样转了一下，他那个轮子已经停止不转了，我这个轮子还在飞快的转动。他对我说：“你看怎样？！”到这时，我才搞清楚，他拉我来是要用事实回答我的问题。
    在这个沸腾的夜里，不觉已是深夜三时了。乡党委书记不但不去休息，还开始了新的工作，召集干部开“鸡叫会”，讨论如何争取在县委规定的时间以前实现一切运转工具滚珠轴承化，夺取全县第一个“化”的红旗。（原载陕西日报）（附图片）
