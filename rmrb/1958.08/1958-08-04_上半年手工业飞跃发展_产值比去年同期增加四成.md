Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: The nation's more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives (groups) and cooperative factories achieved a leap forward in production during the first half of this year. According to statistics from twenty-three provinces (cities) and autonomous regions, the output value of handicrafts in the first half of the year reached 4.33 billion yuan, completing 35.5% of the annual leap forward plan, an increase of 39.6% compared to the same period last year. Product quality has also improved significantly. The Tianjin handicraft industry system has already reached or surpassed advanced domestic and international levels in the quality of more than 200 products. The refined tin recently smelted by the Tianjin No. 3 Smelting Cooperative has exceeded advanced international standards.

A large number of new handicraft products were added in the first half of the year. These products include various agricultural machines serving the great leap forward in agricultural production, such as harvesters, locomobiles, pressure water pumps, and various other water lifting tools, irrigation and drainage machinery, etc.; there are also various industrial mechanical equipment, such as various lathes, gantry planers, and various precision instruments, etc.; there are also high-end consumer goods for people's daily use, such as cameras, watches, etc.

The great leap forward in handicraft production has played a significant role in supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production and the development of local industry. Handicraft cooperatives in various places have generally cooperated with agricultural cooperatives to vigorously carry out farm tool reforms, manufacturing and promoting a large number of new-style farm tools, solving the problem of insufficient rural labor. The leap forward in handicraft production has also strongly supported the development of local industry (especially township and commune industry). Many regions use handicrafts as the foundation for developing local industry. Various small machines and equipment produced by handicraft cooperatives have also provided a material basis for the development of local industry, making up for the shortcomings in the supply of national industrial equipment.

These great achievements in production by handicraft cooperatives in various places are the result of the mass technical innovation movement of "everyone offering ideas and everyone contributing suggestions" by the vast number of cooperative members after the rectification campaign and studying the general line. The level of mechanization in many cooperatives has been greatly improved. At present, the number of machines and equipment in handicraft cooperatives across the country has increased from 40,000 to 50,000 in 1957 to 70,000 to 80,000.

    上半年手工业飞跃发展
    产值比去年同期增加四成
    据新华社3日讯　全国十万多个手工业合作社（组）和合作工厂，今年上半年生产获得飞跃发展。据二十三个省（市）自治区的统计，上半年手工业产值达到四十三亿三千万元，完成年度跃进计划的35.5％，比去年同期增加39.6％。产品质量也有了显著提高。天津市手工业系统已经有二百多种产品质量赶上或者超过了国内外先进水平。天津市第三冶炼社最近炼制的精锡，超过国际先进水平。
    上半年的手工业新产品大量增加。这些产品中包括为农业生产大跃进服务的各种农业机械，如收割机、锅驼机、压力抽水机和其他各种提水工具、排灌机械等；也有各种工业机械设备，如各式车床、龙门刨床和各种精密仪器等；还有人民日用高级消费用品，如照相机、手表等。
    手工业生产大跃进对支援农业生产大跃进和地方工业的发展起了重大的作用。各地手工业社普遍配合农业社大搞农具改革，大量制造和推广新式农具，解决了农村劳动力不足的问题。手工业生产的跃进也有力地支援了地方工业（特别是乡、社工业）的发展。许多地区都以手工业作为发展地方工业的基础。手工业社生产的各种小型机器设备也为地方工业的发展提供了物质基础，弥补了国家工业设备供应方面的不足。
    各地手工业合作社生产上的这些巨大成就，是广大社员经过整风运动和学习总路线以后，经过几个月的“人人出主意，个个献计策”的群众性技术革新运动，许多合作社的机械化水平已大大提高。目前全国手工业社的机器设备，已由1957年的四五万台增加到七、八万台。
