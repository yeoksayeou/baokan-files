Xinhua News Agency, August 25th -- The full text of Prime Minister Sihanouk's farewell speech at the Beijing airport is as follows:

Your Excellency, Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:

After a memorable visit to your great and beautiful country, the moment of parting has now arrived. At this moment, I do not know how to express our deep emotion and gratitude for your grand and fraternal reception. Your friendship and sympathy for the Cambodian people, so sincerely displayed everywhere during our journey, have deeply moved us. On behalf of the Cambodian people, I would like to express our gratitude to you once again.

Our stay in China was not a perfunctory formal visit. You gave us the opportunity to see your impressive achievements and study your exciting experiences. In the years to come, our country will draw from this examples to follow and topics for reflection. We have had the most frank and friendly talks with your leaders. Our common problems have therefore been clarified, and our friendship and unity have gained strength and vitality from this.

The peace of the world and Asia has always been the center of our concern and discussion. Neither of our countries harbors the evil intentions that some people sometimes accuse us of. We simply ask to live freely, coexist peacefully with the world, and work to ensure the happiness of our people. We reiterate our conviction that contact between leaders and between peoples is necessary. People may not understand each other, but they will never be hostile to each other. May all artificial suspicions between peoples and nations be eliminated, and may all countries, large and small, enter an era of peace and prosperity.

Dearest friends, we put our hands in your hands. We are convinced that from now on, on the road to creating a peaceful and happy future for our descendants, we will move forward with greater confidence and a more determined pace.

We hope to have the honor and pleasure of receiving you in our country soon. Our relations and exchanges should develop smoothly on the unbreakable foundation we have jointly built.

Long live the fraternal friendship between Cambodia and China!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live Premier Zhou Enlai and the Government of the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese people!

    新华社25日讯　西哈努克首相在北京机场上的告别讲话，全文如下：总理先生阁下，女士们，先生们：
    在你们伟大和美丽的国家进行了令人难忘的访问之后，现在告别的时刻已经到来了。在这一时刻，我不知道怎样表达我们对于你们这次这样隆重和兄弟般的接待的深切的激动和感谢，你们对高棉人民的友谊和同情，在我们的旅程中到处都这样真诚地显示出来，使我们深深感动。我谨代表高棉人民，再一次向你们表示感谢。
    我们在中国的逗留，并不是拘泥形式的通常正式访问，你们给了我们参观你们的给人深刻印象的成就和研究你们的令人兴奋的经验的机会。在今后的岁月中，我们的国家将从中吸取追随的榜样和思考的题目。我们同你们的领导人进行了最坦率和最友好的谈话。我们的共同问题因此而得到明朗化，我们的友谊和团结从中获得了力量和生气。
    世界和亚洲的和平始终是我们关心和讨论的中心，我们两国都不怀有某些人有时指控我们的那种邪恶企图。我们只是要求自由地生活，同全世界和平共处，为保证我 们人民的幸福而劳动。我们再一次表示确信，领导人之间和人民之间的接触是必要的。人民可能互不了解，但是决不会互相敌视。但愿人民和国家之间的所有人为的猜疑都告消除，而所有大小国家都进入一个和平和繁荣的时代。
    最敬爱的朋友们，我们把我们的手放在你们的手里。我们深信，从今以后，在走向为我们的子孙创造和平和幸福的未来的道路上，我们将以更有信心和更加坚定的步伐向前迈进。
    我们希望不久能够在我国荣幸地和愉快地接待你们。在我们共同建立起来的牢不可破的基础上，我们的关系和往来应该顺利地发展。
    柬埔寨和中国之间的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    周恩来总理和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    中国人民万岁！
