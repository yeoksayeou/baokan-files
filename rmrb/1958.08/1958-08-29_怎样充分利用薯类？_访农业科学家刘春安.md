　　How to Make Full Use of Tubers?
　　——An Interview with Agricultural Scientist Liu Chun'an
　　By our reporter Zhu Xueke
    This year, there will be a general bumper harvest of tubers nationwide. How can we make full use of the tubers that will be harvested in large quantities soon? Recently, our reporter specifically interviewed agricultural scientist Liu Chun'an on this issue.
  A Problem That Needs to Be Solved Urgently
    Liu Chun'an said that it is extremely important and timely for our country to propose arrangements for the utilization of the upcoming bumper harvest of tubers. He said that there are many types of tubers planted in our country, such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, yam beans, cassava, etc. The main producing areas of sweet potatoes are the Pearl River, Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River basins, and the main producing areas of potatoes are North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. In the past two decades, their planting area has been continuously expanding. According to records, in 1931, the national planting area of tubers was only over 30 million mu; in the years after liberation, it was over 105 million mu in 1949, and this year it will be over 230 million mu.
    Although both sweet potatoes and potatoes are high-yield crops, due to past extensive cultivation, the yield per mu was mostly one to two thousand catties, and a yield of three to four thousand catties per mu was considered good. In recent years, due to improved cultivation techniques and improved varieties, the yield per mu has rapidly increased. Now, a yield of one to two thousand catties per mu is common, and a yield of two to thirty thousand catties per mu will also appear. There are also high-yield "satellite" fields with a yield of over one million catties per mu being cultivated. With such a large planting area and such a high yield, how to make full use of the large amount of tubers harvested nationwide? This has become a prominent problem. At the same time, because tubers contain a lot of moisture and are not resistant to low temperatures, tuber blocks are prone to rot and deteriorate when exposed to temperatures below 9 degrees Celsius. Therefore, it is also very urgent to arrange the handling and utilization of tubers before the harvest season arrives.
    A Treasure in People's Lives
    Liu Chun'an said that tubers are indeed a treasure in our lives. They contain a large amount of starch, as well as a certain amount of sugar, protein, fat, and inorganic salts. They can be eaten, used as livestock feed, and also as industrial raw materials. At present, in order to further improve the grain consumption situation, tubers should first satisfy human consumption, and then be used as feed, develop sideline businesses, and as raw materials for industry. In terms of consumption, sweet potatoes and potatoes have high nutritional value and excellent flavor. Sweet potatoes have always been an important grain for the broad masses of working people in rural areas of our country, especially the people in the southern mountainous areas and the Yellow River and Huai River basins, who used to rely on sweet potatoes as their main food source, with the saying "one season of sweet potatoes, half a year's grain" circulating; many local working people are also accustomed to using potatoes as vegetables and rice. Tubers have great value in terms of consumption, on the one hand because they are rich in nutrients, and on the other hand, they can be made into all kinds of meals. In terms of nutritional components, according to existing analyses by the scientific community, compared with the same amount of sweet potatoes (fresh sweet potatoes) and rice (see Table 1), except for calcium and vitamins A, B, and C, other components of sweet potatoes are not as good as rice, but when calculating the equal calorific value of the two foods, all the others exceed it except for protein, especially vitamins A and C, which rice does not have at all. Therefore, in some rural areas of our country, sweet potatoes are used as food and also as vegetables. Potatoes contain almost the same nutrients as sweet potatoes, and are also rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. Especially in northern areas lacking fresh fruits and vegetables, potatoes are the main source of vitamin C. Its calorific value exceeds that of ordinary vegetables.
    In terms of food production varieties, the broad masses of people in various places have the habit of eating fresh tubers raw, boiled, steamed, roasted, slicing fresh tubers, shredding them, drying them, grinding them into powder or boiling them. In recent years, due to the gradual attention paid to the use of tubers as food, the production technology has been continuously improved. Many places use tubers as the main ingredient and mix in varying amounts of other grains to make staple foods that people in the north and south love to eat. Some places also process and produce high-end banquets and various delicious pastries. For example, Foshan in Guangdong and Dongguang in Hebei produce hundreds of kinds of tuber foods. In the past, some people said that tubers have their shortcomings and limitations as food because they did not understand the nutritional value of tubers; in fact, this is because these people have a prejudice against tubers and have not improved their production technology well.
    Good Feed
    The roots, stems, and leaves of tubers are all good feed for livestock. For example, comparing the nutrients contained in the stems and leaves of sweet potatoes with clover (see Table 2), this can be clearly seen. Although the cellulose content of sweet potato stems and leaves is slightly lower than that of clover, the protein content of its stem and leaf hay is almost equal to that of clover, and the content of fat, carbohydrates, and ash exceeds that of clover. If sweet potato tubers are used as feed, their nutrition is even richer.
    Another major advantage of using sweet potato vines and leaves as livestock feed is that their yield is high. The yield of sweet potato vines and leaves is almost one-to-one with the weight of the roots and tubers. Mixing it with corn stalks and other materials to make silage, its feed value is also higher than that of ordinary forage. Therefore, the bumper harvest of tubers also provides a large amount of feed for livestock and provides favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry.
    A Versatile Raw Material for the Food Industry
    In addition to being used for food and feed, tubers are also raw materials for light industry. Some people say that tubers are a versatile raw material for the food industry, and the fact is indeed the case. Because they contain 15% to 27% starch, they can be used to make starch, sugar, sauces, wine, and vinegar, and various foods and beverages. In addition, it can also be used as a raw material for making automobile tires, galoshes, movie film, particularly valuable paint for painting submarines and airplanes, rayon, perfume, medicines, and various plastic products. In recent years, with the development of China's industry, various places have paid attention to using tubers as raw materials for winemaking and maltose production. According to the situation in various places, every 100 catties of fresh sweet potatoes and potatoes can produce 15 to 30 catties of sugar with a sugar content of 78 to 80 degrees, and 15 to 18 catties of 62-degree baijiu. Every 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes can produce baijiu at a rate of 72% to 75%, and alcohol at a rate of 54%. Because the amount of wine needed in various places has a certain limit. Judging from the current trend, with the development of industrial and agricultural production and the transportation industry, using tubers to produce alcohol, especially fuel alcohol, is a promising way out. This is also the direction of the leap forward in the current brewing industry. In order to make full use of tubers in industry, in addition to universally promoting the production of starch, sugar, and winemaking, we should also find other more ways to use them locally and in accordance with local conditions.
    We Must Advocate Comprehensive Utilization
    After talking about the wide range of uses of tubers, Liu Chun'an said that at present, the key for the broad masses of people in our country to make full use of tubers lies in advocating comprehensive utilization. Only by adopting comprehensive utilization methods can we achieve full and rational use of tubers. As mentioned above, in the past, the masses had already come up with various utilization methods such as making starch, sugar, wine, and feed, but such methods were not systematic and comprehensive enough to achieve the purpose of full utilization. For example, fresh tubers contain 15% to 27% starch, 1.5% to 5% sugar, 1.1% to 2% protein, about 0.2% fat, about 1% inorganic salts, about 0.7% fiber, and some other ingredients and moisture. Therefore, when it comes to utilizing its starch content, if we pay attention to comprehensive utilization, after producing tuber starch, we can use the starch residue to make syrup or crystalline glucose, and the sugar residue can be used to make wine, and the distiller's grains can be used to make vinegar or as feed. If we don't make starch or vinegar, we can make sugar first and then make wine, and use the distiller's grains as feed. The reason why we need to adopt such a comprehensive utilization process is because the starch of tubers cannot be completely extracted after one treatment; even after several treatments, there is still residue. At the same time, although some of the protein, fat, and other components it contains flow out with the sugar, some of them solidify and remain. At the same time, because the fiber is easily digested by livestock after fermentation and other treatments, it still has the value of fattening livestock. At present, if we can find a way to utilize other substances such as protein and fat in the process of comprehensively utilizing its starch, it would be even better. If various places can mobilize the masses to find ways, they will definitely be able to solve the problem.
    New Topics for Scientific Research
    Finally, Liu Chun'an commented on the issue of comprehensive utilization of tubers in connection with scientific research, saying that in the past, the attention of agricultural scientific research was mostly focused on how to obtain high yields of tubers, and little attention was paid to studying the relationship between tubers and people. According to the current progress of the work, agricultural scientific researchers still need to closely integrate with the practice of the broad masses of farmers, study how to further improve the yield of tubers, improve the quality of tubers, increase the content of protein and fat, and further increase the value of their utilization by people; on the other hand, it is necessary to add new topics and include the issue of comprehensive utilization of tubers in the plan.

　　怎样充分利用薯类？
　　——访农业科学家刘春安
　　本报记者　朱学科
    今年全国薯类将普告丰收。如何充分利用即将大量收获的薯类？最近，记者特就这一问题，访问农业科学家刘春安。
  一个迫待解决的问题
    刘春安说，目前我国提出安排即将大丰收的薯类的利用问题，是极其重要而适时的。他说，在我国种植的薯类种类很多，如甘薯、马铃薯、芋头、豆薯、木薯等。甘薯的主要产地为珠江、长江、黄河、淮河流域，马铃薯的主要产地是华北、东北和西北各地。近二十多年来，它们的种植面积在不断地扩大。据材料记载，1931年，全国种植薯类的面积仅有三千多万亩，解放几年来，1949年为一亿零五百多万亩，今年则为二亿三千多万亩。
    甘薯和马铃薯虽都是高产作物，但是由于过去耕作粗放，亩产量多在一、二千斤，亩产三、四千斤的就算是不错了。近几年来，由于改进耕作技术和改良品种，亩产量迅速地上升，现在亩产一、二万斤的已是常事，亩产二、三十万斤的也将出现，还有培育亩产百万斤以上的高产“卫星”田。种植的面积这样大，产量又这样高，全国收获了大量薯类以后如何充分地利用？这就变成了一个突出的问题。同时，由于薯类含水份多，不耐低温，薯块经受摄氏九度以下温度时，就容易腐烂变坏。因此，在收获季节到来之前，安排好处理和利用薯类的问题，也显得很迫切。
    人们生活中的宝
    刘春安说，薯类的确是我们生活中的一个宝，它们含有大量的淀粉，还含有一定分量的糖份、蛋白质、脂肪和无机盐。它可以食用、做牲畜的饲料，也可以做工业原料。在目前，为了进一步改善粮食消费状况，薯类在首先满足人吃为主以外，其次才是用作饲料、发展副业和工业的原料。在食用方面，甘薯和马铃薯的营养价值高，风味优美。甘薯向来是我国农村广大劳动人民的重要粮食，特别是南方山区和黄淮流域一带人民，过去都依赖甘薯为主要食粮，流传有“一季甘薯半年粮”的说法；不少地方劳动人民也都习惯于以马铃薯作菜作饭。薯类在食用方面的价值大，一方面由于它富有营养成份，另一方面，又能做出各式各样的饭菜。在营养成份方面，根据科学界已有的分析，同量的甘薯（鲜薯）和稻米比较（见表一），除钙和维生素甲、乙、丙以外，其他成份甘薯虽不及稻米，但以两种食物相等发热量计算，则除蛋白质稍稍不及稻米外，其余都超过它，特别是维生素甲、丙，稻米根本没有。所以在我国有些农村以甘薯作食粮，同时也兼作蔬菜。马铃薯所含的各种营养成份与甘薯差不多，它也含有丰富的蛋白质、维生素和矿物质。特别是在北方缺乏新鲜水果和蔬菜的地方，马铃薯是维生素丙的主要来源。它的发热量超过一般蔬菜。
    在食物制作品种方面，各地广大人民向有以鲜薯生吃、煮吃、蒸吃、烤吃，把鲜薯切片、切丝晒干、磨粉或煮食等习惯。近年来，由于对利用薯类作食用的问题已逐渐引起人们的重视，制作技术有不断的改进，很多地方都以薯类为主掺入分量不等的其他粮食，作出各种南、北方人民爱吃的主食。有的地方还加工制作出高级宴席和各种可口的糕点。如广东佛山、河北东光所制作的薯类食品就达几百种。过去有些人因为没有了解到薯类的营养价值，说薯类作食品有其缺点和局限性；实际上，这是由于这些人存在看不起薯类的偏见，没有很好提高制作技术。
    良好的饲料
    薯类的根、茎和叶，都是牲畜的好饲料。如以甘薯的茎和叶所含的养分与牧草三叶草比较（见表二），就可以很明显地看出这一点。甘薯的茎和叶的纤维素含量虽稍低于三叶草，但是其茎、叶干草在蛋白质含量方面，几乎与三叶草相等，脂肪、碳水化合物、灰分的含量超过三叶草。如用甘薯块作饲料，其营养则更丰富。
    用甘薯的蔓、叶作牲畜的饲料，还有一个最大的好处，是它的产量高。甘薯的蔓、叶的产量差不多与根块的重量成一比一。把它与玉米秸等混合制造青贮，其饲用价值也比一般饲草高。因此，薯类的大丰收，也为牲畜提供了大量饲料，为发展畜牧业提供了有利条件。
    食品工业的万能原料
    除去食用和作饲料以外，薯类也是轻工业的原料。有人说薯类是食品工业的万能原料，事实的确是这样，由于它含有15％到27％的淀粉，可以制作淀粉、糖、酱、酒和醋各种食品和饮料。除此以外，它还可以作为制作汽车轮胎、套鞋、电影胶片、用以涂染潜水艇和飞机的特别有价值的漆、人造丝、香水、药物以及各种塑料制品等的原料。近几年来，随着我国工业的发展，各地已注意用薯类作为制酒和制饴糖的原料。根据各地的情况，每百斤鲜甘薯、马铃薯可制作糖七十八度到八十度水度的糖十五斤到三十斤，出六十二度白酒十五斤到十八斤，每百斤薯干可出白酒率在72％到75％，出酒精率为54％。由于各地对于酒的需要量有一定的限度。从目前的趋势看，随着工农业生产及交通运输业的发展，用薯类制造酒精特别是燃料酒精，是一个大有可为的出路。这也是当前酿酒业的跃进方向。为了在工业方面充分利用薯类，除去普遍推广制造淀粉、糖和酿酒等门路以外，还应该就地取材、因地制宜地寻找其他更多的门路。
    要提倡综合利用
    刘春安谈了关于薯类的广大用途以后，又说，目前，我国广大人民要充分的利用薯类，关键在于要提倡综合利用。只有采取综合利用的方法，才能够做到充分地合理地利用薯类。如上面所说，过去群众也已想出了制淀粉、糖、酒，作饲料等各种利用办法，但是那样的办法还不够系统全面，不能达到充分的利用的目的。例如，鲜薯类都含有15％到27％的淀粉，糖分1.5％到5％，蛋白质1.1％到2％，脂肪0.2％上下，无机盐1％上下，纤维0.7％上下，还有一些其它成分和水分。所以对它所含的淀粉质利用来说，如果注意综合利用，在制造出薯类的淀粉以后，就可以用淀粉渣子做糖稀或结晶葡萄糖，糖渣子可以做酒，酒渣子可以制醋或作饲料。如果不做淀粉也不制醋，就可以先做糖，后做酒，用酒糟子作饲料。所以需要采取这样综合利用的过程，是因为薯类的淀粉不是经过一次处理就能把它提炼干净；就是经过若干次处理以后，还有残存。同时，它所含的蛋白质、脂肪等成分，虽有一部分随糖流出，但还有一部分凝固留存。同时，由于纤维经过发酵等处理以后，牲畜吃了容易消化，因而仍有肥牲畜的价值。目前，如果能在综合利用其淀粉的过程中，再能想出办法，把其他的如蛋白质、脂肪等也利用起来，就更好了。各地如果能发动群众想办法，一定也能解决问题。
    科学研究工作的新课题
    最后，刘春安联系科学研究工作对于综合利用薯类问题发表意见说，过去农业科学研究工作的注意力多集中在如何求得薯类丰产上，没有注意到研究薯类与人们的关系问题。根据目前工作的进展情况，农业科学研究工作者一方面仍然需要与广大农民的实践密切结合起来，研究如何进一步提高薯类的产量，改进薯类的品质，增加蛋白质和脂肪的含量，更增加人们对它利用的价值；另一方面，必须增加新的课题，把综合利用薯类的问题列入规划。（附图表）
