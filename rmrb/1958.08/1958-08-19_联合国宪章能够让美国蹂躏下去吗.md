Can the UN Charter Allow the US to Continue Trampling?
　　US President Eisenhower, who sent troops to invade Lebanon, actually disguised himself as a protector of the UN Charter. At the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on August 13, he said without blushing, "We (the United States) steadfastly abide by the principles of the (UN) Charter," and "always try to act within the spirit of the UN Charter." He also said, "The UN Charter places a solemn obligation on all of us" to "respect each other's sovereignty," otherwise "the prospect of peace envisioned by the Charter would become a laughing stock"... However, Eisenhower's speech itself immediately became a laughing stock around the world. The Cairo "People's Daily" editorial on August 14 wrote that Eisenhower's speech "was like acting, it aroused laughter. Because after years of threatening and constantly stubbornly interfering in the internal affairs of the Arabs, who would believe his statement that the United States respects Arab independence?" The newspaper's commentary questioned Eisenhower, "When you are shamelessly demanding that UN forces replace your troops to defend the enemies of the people, who can believe that you are acting in Lebanon in accordance with the UN Charter?"
    Article 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter clearly stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or any other state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." Article 2, paragraph 7 also stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." However, the US government openly carried out armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs and threatened other Arab countries with force. And to this day, the US invading troops are still赖 in Lebanon and refuse to leave. May I ask Eisenhower, which principle of the UN Charter is the US's aggressive action in compliance with?
    When the US invaded Lebanon, it not only threw the principles and spirit of the UN Charter to the clouds, but also discarded the UN organization as a whole. The US government first sent troops to land in Lebanon based on its own decision, and only "immediately went to the Security Council" after its troops, tanks, and artillery had occupied Lebanon. This practice is obviously a great mockery of the United Nations!
    Eisenhower clung to the "right of self-defense" stipulated in the UN Charter as his shield. Article 51 of the UN Charter speaks of this right, saying: "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." However, this cannot save Eisenhower. On the contrary, it can only further prove that the US arbitrarily violates the UN Charter. First, Lebanon has not been subjected to external armed attacks at all. Second, the US's armed intervention in Lebanon was not before the Security Council took measures, but after the Security Council had already dispatched an observer mission to Lebanon. Third, neither the US itself nor the US citizens in Lebanon have been subjected to any infringement, and there is no question of US "self-defense" at all. No one can deny that the US's actions in Lebanon are naked interference and aggression, and the most blatant violation of the UN Charter.
    After the US threw the United Nations aside and invaded Lebanon, it now wants to pick up the United Nations again as a tool to cover up and continue its aggression. Eisenhower's proposal to establish a standing UN force in his speech on August 13 was to achieve this goal. Prior to this, Dulles also said at a press conference on July 31 that the US intended to send a "UN force" to Lebanon and Jordan, as well as any place that was subjected to so-called "indirect aggression." However, everyone knows that the so-called "UN force" is just a signboard, and it is actually a synonym for US and British troops. The United States and Britain want to use this deceptive method to maintain their continued occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. That is to say, if the people of Lebanon and Jordan do not accept the occupation of US and British troops, then they must accept the occupation of the so-called "UN force." But people can't help but ask, why must Lebanon and Jordan be occupied by foreign troops in order to live? Eisenhower, while repeatedly saying that the US "respects" the sovereignty of Arab countries, insists on the occupation of Arab countries by foreign troops. Isn't this slapping himself in the face?
    The US's behavior of trampling on the UN Charter did not begin now. Since the establishment of the United Nations, the US has consistently tried its best to control it in its own hands. US Assistant Secretary of State Rusk once openly said in October 1950: "We (the United States) are the United Nations... When we refer to the United Nations, that means ourselves." For many years, the US has indeed treated the United Nations with this arrogant attitude of "L'état, c'est moi." When the US needs this tool, it abuses it; when the US does not need it, it throws it aside. Due to the US's sabotage and trampling, the work of the United Nations often fails to reflect the expectations of the people of the world, and often fails to fulfill its responsibility to maintain international cooperation and security as stipulated in the UN Charter.
    Under the manipulation of the US, the United Nations has done a series of disgraceful things. It has vetoed and rejected many proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to maintain world peace and promote international cooperation. At the same time, it has failed to stop the US from violating the UN Charter, organizing aggressive military blocs around the world, establishing numerous military bases, subverting the legitimate governments of sovereign countries, interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and pursuing policies of war preparation and aggression. This has allowed the US to often carry out various aggressive activities unscrupulously under the banner of the United Nations. In 1950, the US actually launched a war of aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations. Under the banner of the United Nations, the US aggressors scorched the land of Korea, bombed the peaceful cities and villages of Korea, and brutally massacred countless Korean men, women, old and young. The US aggressors, wearing the uniforms of the "UN forces," used bacteriological weapons in Korea, and created a living hell of persecuting prisoners of war in places such as Geoje Island and Jeju Island... All of this cannot but bring great shame to the United Nations. At the same time, for a long time, the US has stubbornly stuffed the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, a political zombie, which had long been spurned by the Chinese people, into the seat of the permanent member of the Security Council. All of these cannot but greatly undermine the prestige and moral strength of the United Nations and its Security Council.
    Eisenhower's high-profile singing of the tune of "protecting the independence of small countries" and "respecting national sovereignty" on the UN General Assembly podium is especially a great self-mockery. For several years, it has been the manipulation by colonial countries headed by the US that has caused the United Nations to frequently violate the principles stipulated in the UN Charter in maintaining national independence and preventing colonial aggression. In this regard, the US has also left a series of shameful records in the United Nations. For example, the US has always taken a colonialist stance on the Algerian issue, believing that Algeria is an "integral part" of France. At the tenth session of the UN General Assembly in 1955, the US opposed including the Algerian issue on the agenda. At the eleventh session of the UN General Assembly in 1956, the US manipulated the voting machine to veto the proposal of the eighteen Asian and African countries demanding recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination. At the twelfth session of the UN General Assembly in 1957, the US again vetoed the proposal of the seventeen Asian and African countries including the same content. Similarly, the US has always supported the French colonialists on the issues of Tunisia and Morocco, and opposed the Tunisian and Moroccan people having full rights to self-determination. On the issue of West Irian in Indonesia, the US has always stood with the Netherlands. Only for the sake of some camouflage, the US abstained from voting in the four UN General Assembly discussions on West Irian from 1954 to 1957. Whenever the United Nations really needs to take action to protect small countries from foreign aggression, the US tries its best to undermine it. In 1954, Guatemala was subjected to armed aggression by the US and requested the United Nations to convene a Security Council meeting three times, but the US representative insisted that the Security Council was "not suitable" to take measures, and as a result, the United Nations did not even emit a weak sound on the Guatemala incident. On November 5, 1956, the Soviet Union proposed to the Security Council to take urgent measures to stop the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, and proposed to the US that the Soviet Union and the US cooperate in using force to stop the aggression against Egypt, but the US rejected the Soviet Union's proposal. In 1957, when the UN General Assembly discussed Syria's proposal to stop the US and Turkish aggression, Dulles actually gave a speech, insulting the people of the Middle East as being "mentally deranged." Finally, the US even opposed the proposal of sending an investigation committee by the United Nations, which led to no results in this discussion. Can all these facts prove that the US is abiding by the principles of the UN Charter and safeguarding national independence and sovereignty? On the contrary, whether outside the scope of the United Nations or in the activities of the United Nations itself, the US has rudely violated the basic principles of the UN Charter.
    Currently, the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session is discussing the issue of the tense situation in the Middle East caused by the US and British aggression. Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, Czechoslovakia, Saudi Arabia, Bulgaria and other countries have demanded that the US and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, while the US and British aggressors are trying their best to evade the issue of troop withdrawal and are playing political conspiracies in an attempt to continue their aggression against the Middle East. The presence of US and British troops in the Middle East not only keeps the situation in the Middle East in a tense and dangerous state, but also is an insult to the UN organization and the principles of the UN Charter. Countries that truly love peace and the dignity of the United Nations must work to promote the United Nations to take measures to make the US and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. Whether the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session can accomplish this task is a serious test of whether the United Nations can shoulder the solemn responsibility of maintaining international peace and security.
    Can the UN Charter allow the US to continue trampling on it like this? This is a realistic question placed before the United Nations. Regardless of the outcome of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session, peace-loving people all over the world will fight to the end to promote the withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East!

### 联合国宪章能够让美国蹂躏下去吗

　　联合国宪章能够让美国蹂躏下去吗
    派兵侵略黎巴嫩的美国总统艾森豪威尔，居然把自己打扮成为联合国宪章的保护人。在8月13日的联合国大会紧急特别会议上，他毫不脸红地说，
  “我们（美国）坚持不渝地遵守（联合国）宪章的原则”，“始终设法在联合国宪章的精神以内行事”。他又说，“联合国宪章使我们全体都负有某种庄严的义务”，即“尊重彼此的主权”，否则“宪章所规划的和平前景就会成为一种笑柄”……。可是，艾森豪威尔的这个演说本身却立即成为全世界的笑柄了。开罗“人民报”8月14日的社论写道，艾森豪威尔的演说“像在演戏，它引起了笑声。因为在多年来一直进行威胁和不断地固执地干涉阿拉伯人的内政以后，谁还相信他所说的美国尊重阿拉伯独立的说法呢？”这家报纸的评论质问艾森豪威尔，“当你在无耻地要求联合国部队代替你的部队来保卫人民的敌人的时候，谁能相信你在黎巴嫩是遵照联合国宪章行事呢？”
    联合国宪章第二条第四款明明规定：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或任何国家之领土完整或政治独立。”第二条第七款又规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。但是，美国政府却公然对黎巴嫩的内政进行武装干涉，并以武力威胁其他的阿拉伯国家。而且直到今天，美国侵略军队仍然赖在黎巴嫩不走。试问艾森豪威尔，美国这种侵略行动究竟是在遵守联合国宪章的哪一条原则呢？
    美国在侵略黎巴嫩的时候，不仅把联合国宪章的原则和精神抛到九霄云外，而且把联合国这个机构也整个地丢在一边了。美国政府首先根据它自己的决定派兵登陆黎巴嫩，而在它的军队、坦克、大炮已经占领了黎巴嫩以后，才“立即前往安理会”。这种做法，显然是对于联合国的莫大嘲弄！
    艾森豪威尔死死抓住联合国宪章中规定的“自卫权利”，作为他的护身符。联合国宪章第五十一条谈到这种权利的时候说：“本宪章的任何规定不得妨碍联合国任何会员国在遭受武力攻击时，在安全理事会采取必要措施来维持国际和平与安全以前，进行单独或集体自卫的固有权利”。可是，这并不能挽救艾森豪威尔，恰恰相反，只能更加证明美国任意违反联合国宪章。第一，黎巴嫩根本没有受到外来的武力攻击。第二，美国对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉，不是在安理会采取措施以前，而是在安理会已经派遣观察团去黎巴嫩以后。第三，不论美国本国，还是美国在黎巴嫩的侨民，都没有受到任何侵犯，根本不发生美国的“自卫”问题。任何人也没有办法否认：美国在黎巴嫩的行动是赤裸裸的干涉和侵略，是对于联合国宪章的最粗暴的破坏。
    美国把联合国抛在一边，侵略了黎巴嫩以后，现在又想把联合国拾起来，作为掩饰侵略和继续侵略的工具。艾森豪威尔在8月13日的演说中提出要建立一支常备的联合国部队，就是为了实现这种目的。在这以前，杜勒斯在7月31日的记者招待会上也曾经说过，美国打算把一支“联合国部队”派到黎巴嫩和约旦以及任何受到所谓“间接侵略”的地方去。可是，谁都知道，所谓“联合国部队”，只是一块招牌，它实际上是美英军队的代名词。美国和英国想用这种遮眼法来保持他们对黎巴嫩和约旦的继续占领。这也就是说，如果黎巴嫩和约旦人民不接受美英军队的占领，那么就要接受所谓“联合国部队”的占领。可是人们不禁要问，为什么黎巴嫩和约旦必须由外国军队占领才能生活呢？艾森豪威尔一边口口声声说美国“尊重”阿拉伯国家的主权，一边却又坚持要由外国军队占领阿拉伯国家，这不是自打嘴巴吗？
    美国蹂躏联合国宪章的行为，并不是从现在才开始的。从联合国成立以来，美国一贯竭力把它操纵在自己的手里。美国助理国务卿鲁斯克在1950年10月曾经公开说：“我们（美国）就是联合国。……当我们指联合国时，那就是指的我们自己。”多年以来，美国的确就是用这种“朕即国家”的狂妄态度来对待联合国的。当美国需要这个工具的时候，就加以滥用；当美国不需要它的时候，就把它抛在一边。由于美国的破坏和蹂躏，联合国的工作经常不能体现全世界人民对它的期望，经常不能尽到联合国宪章所规定的维护国际合作与安全的责任。
    在美国的操纵下，联合国干下了一连串不光彩的事情。它否决和拒绝了苏联和其他爱好和平国家为维护世界和平促进国际合作而提出的许多建议，而对于美国违反联合国宪章，在世界各地组织侵略性的军事集团，建立星罗棋布的军事基地，颠覆主权国家的合法政府，干涉他国内政，推行备战和侵略政策等等，则没有加以制止。这就使得美国常常能够在联合国的旗帜下肆无忌惮地进行各种侵略活动。1950年，美国竟利用联合国的名义，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。美国侵略者在联合国的旗帜下，烧焦了朝鲜的土地，炸毁了朝鲜的和平城市和乡村，残暴地屠杀了无数的朝鲜男女老幼。美国侵略者穿着“联合国军”的制服，在朝鲜使用了细菌武器，在巨济岛和济州岛等地制造了迫害战俘的人间地狱……。所有这些，不能不使联合国蒙受奇耻大辱；同时，长期以来，美国硬把早就被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石集团的代表，一具政治僵尸，塞在安理会常任理事的座位上。这些都不能不使联合国和它的安理会的威信和道义力量，遭受极大的破坏。
    艾森豪威尔在联合国大会的讲台上高唱“保护小国独立”和“尊重民族主权”的论调，这尤其是莫大的自我讽刺。几年以来，就是由于以美国为首的殖民国家的操纵，使联合国在维护民族独立和制止殖民侵略的问题上，经常违背了联合国宪章所规定的原则。在这方面，美国在联合国里也留下了一系列可耻的纪录。例如，美国一直在阿尔及利亚问题上采取殖民主义的立场，认为阿尔及利亚是法国“不可分割的一部分”。在1955年第十届联合国大会上，美国反对把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程。在1956年第十一届联合国大会上，美国操纵表决机器否决了要求承认阿尔及利亚人民自决权的亚非十八国提案。在1957年第十二届联合国大会上，美国又否决了包括同样内容的亚非十七国提案。同样的，美国在突尼斯和摩洛哥问题上也一直支持法国殖民者，反对突尼斯和摩洛哥人民有充分的自决权。在印度尼西亚的西伊里安问题上，美国始终同荷兰站在一边，只是为了作某种掩饰，美国在从1954年到1957年的四届联合国大会讨论西伊里安问题时都投了“弃权”票。当每次真正需要联合国采取行动保护小国不受外国侵犯的时候，美国更是极力加以破坏。1954年，危地马拉受到美国的武装侵犯，曾经三次请求联合国召开安理会会议，但是美国代表硬说安理会“不适于”采取措施，结果使联合国对危地马拉事件甚至没有发出一点微弱的声音。1956年11月5日，苏联向安理会建议采取急紧措施制止英法侵略埃及，并且向美国建议苏美合作使用武力制止对埃及的侵略，但美国拒绝了苏联的建议。1957年，当联合国大会讨论叙利亚提出的为制止美国和土耳其的侵略的提案时，杜勒斯竟发表演说，污辱中东人民“神志错乱”。最后，美国甚至对于由联合国派遣一个调查委员会的建议也加以反对，遂使这次讨论没有得到任何结果。所有这些事实，难道能证明美国是遵守联合国宪章的原则，维护民族独立和主权的吗？恰恰相反，美国不论在联合国的范围以外，还是在联合国本身的活动之中，都粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章的基本原则。
    目前，联大紧急特别会议正在讨论由于美英侵略而造成的中东紧张局势问题。苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、沙特阿拉伯、保加利亚等国代表都要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，而美英侵略者却竭力回避撤军问题，并玩弄政治阴谋，企图继续侵略中东。美英军队留在中东不但使中东局势仍然处于紧张和危险状态，而且也是对联合国组织和联合国宪章原则的污辱。真正爱护和平和联合国尊严的国家，都必须努力促使联合国采取措施，使美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。联大紧急特别会议能否实现这个任务，是联合国能否担负起维护国际和平与安全庄严职责的严重考验。
    联合国宪章能够让美国这样蹂躏下去吗？这是摆在联合国面前的现实问题。不管联大紧急特别会议讨论的结果如何，全世界爱好和平的人都将为促使美英军队撤出中东而斗争到底！（附图片）
