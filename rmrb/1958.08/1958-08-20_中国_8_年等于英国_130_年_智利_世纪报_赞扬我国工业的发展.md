Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Santiago dispatch: The Chilean Communist Party's newspaper "El Siglo" published an article on August 1st titled "China is Catching Up with Britain," warmly praising the high-speed development of Chinese industry.

The article said that if someone had told the British people in October 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, that in about eight years the Chinese would challenge them in the production of steel, iron, coal, and other important industrial raw materials, probably few British people would have paid attention to such a statement. The colonialists were convinced that the destruction caused by the war, especially considering the economic blockade and trade embargo imposed on China by the West under the instigation of the United States, would cause China's economy to fall even further behind the developed capitalist countries, and that it would never be able to catch up with them. However, China restored its economy in less than four years, and after about four more years, it launched an economic challenge to Britain, one of the most industrialized capitalist countries.

The article pointed out that in these eight years, Britain's industrial production has developed very slowly and unevenly; while China has been advancing non-stop, and at an ever-increasing speed. Now, in terms of the output of important industries, the People's Republic of China has greatly shortened the distance between it and Britain. Last year's Chinese iron production showed that China's development speed in this area was equivalent to Britain's speed from the beginning of the 19th century to the beginning of the 1930s, that is, China's eight years equals Britain's one hundred and thirty years. The article also pointed out that the situation is similar in other important industrial products.

The article wrote that the high-speed development of Chinese industry once again demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. If China had continued on the path of capitalist development, it would have been impossible for China to move forward. However, China has moved in the direction of socialist revolution, and fundamental economic and social reforms have liberated enormous productive forces, liberating the infinite creativity of this giant. The ideals of communism have taken root among the millions of workers and peasants in China, becoming an unprecedented material force and changing the face of this ancient country. The article said that not long ago, people in London and Washington still regarded China's industrialization as a fantasy, but now they have to admit that China's achievements "have exceeded the wildest fantasies." The article refuted the malicious rumors spread by some people that the rapid development of China's industrialization poses a "huge danger" to the West, saying: "If China reaches Britain's industrial level in a few years, who will be harmed by it? The Chinese? No. The British? No either. Obviously, it is the imperialist monopoly capital that is threatened, they hope to maintain colonialism forever and hinder the industrialization of Asian and African countries in order to exploit the people of these countries. China provides a brilliant example for underdeveloped countries."

### 中国8年等于英国130年　智利“世纪报”赞扬我国工业的发展

　　中国8年等于英国130年
　　智利“世纪报”赞扬我国工业的发展
    新华社19日讯  圣地亚哥消息：智利共产党机关报“世纪报”在8月1日发表一篇题为“中国正在赶上英国”的文章，热情赞扬中国工业高速度的发展。
    文章说，假如在1949年10月中华人民共和国宣布成立的时候有人对英国人说，大约八年以后中国人要在钢、铁、煤和其他重要工业原料的生产方面向他们发出挑战，那恐怕没有几个英国人会理睬这种说法。殖民主义者满以为，由于战争的破坏，特别是考虑到由于西方在美国的策动下对中国实行的经济封锁和贸易禁运，会使中国的经济更加远远地落在发达的资本主义国家后面，永远也不能赶上它们了。但是中国在不到四年的时间内恢复了它的经济，又过了大约四年便向工业化程度最高的资本主义国家之一的英国发出了经济挑战。
    文章指出，在这八年内，英国的工业生产发展得很缓慢、很不平衡；而中国则在不停地前进，而且速度越来越高。现在在重要工业产量上中华人民共和国大大缩短了它同英国之间的距离。去年中国铁的产量说明，中国在这方面的发展速度相当于英国从十九世纪初年到本世纪三十年代初年的速度，这就是说中国的八年等于英国的一百三十年。文章还指出，在其他重要工业产品方面，情况也与此不相上下。
    文章写道，中国工业的高速度的发展再次表明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。假如中国继续走资本主义发展的道路，中国就不可能前进。然而中国是朝着社会主义革命的方向迈进了，根本的经济改革和社会改革解放了庞大无比的生产力，解放了这个巨人的无穷的创造力。共产主义的理想已经在中国千千万万的工人和农民中扎了根，成为史无前例的一股物质力量并且正在改变这个古老国家的面貌。文章说，不久以前，伦敦和华盛顿人士还认为中国的工业化是幻想，现在他们不得不承认，中国的成就“已经超过了最大的幻想”。文章驳斥了有些人恶意散布的中国工业化的迅速发展对西方造成“巨大危险”的说法，它说：“假如在几年之后中国达到了英国的工业水平，谁又因此受到损害呢？中国人吗？不。英国人吗？也不。显然受到威胁的是帝国主义垄断资本，他们希望永远维持殖民主义，阻挠亚非国家的工业化，以便剥削这些国家的人民。中国给不发达国家提供了一个辉煌的榜样。”
