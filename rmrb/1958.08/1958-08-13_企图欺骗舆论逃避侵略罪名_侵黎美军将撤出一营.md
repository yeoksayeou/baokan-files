Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 12th: In an attempt to deceive public opinion and find a pretext to escape charges of aggression at the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session on the 13th, the United States is putting on an act as if it were withdrawing troops. Holloway, commander of the invading U.S. forces in Lebanon, announced today that the Second Battalion of the Second Marine Regiment in Lebanon would begin its withdrawal on the 13th.

According to the Associated Press, this U.S. action is clearly an attempt to influence the debate on the Middle East issue at the UN General Assembly emergency special session.

According to United Press International, "The State Department has asked the Defense Department to withdraw at least some U.S. troops from Lebanon symbolically before the UN General Assembly meeting on the 13th." At the same time, "A Marine battalion being rotated is preparing to depart for the Mediterranean. However, this battalion may remain on U.S. warships in the Mediterranean and can be deployed at any time if needed. This would have the effect of reducing U.S. troops in Lebanon without reducing the total U.S. troop strength in the Mediterranean." Clearly, withdrawing one battalion and then bringing in another that "can be deployed at any time" is the U.S.'s "symbolic" troop withdrawal trick!

United Press International also quoted U.S. military sources as saying that the Marine battalion currently stationed in Lebanon should have been "rotated" back to the United States long ago. Its return date had been postponed twice, the second time being when U.S. troops began landing in Lebanon.

### 企图欺骗舆论逃避侵略罪名　侵黎美军将撤出一营

　　企图欺骗舆论逃避侵略罪名
　　侵黎美军将撤出一营
    新华社12日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国为了欺骗舆论和在13日举行的联合国大会紧急特别会议上为它的侵略罪名寻找遁辞，装出了一副像要撤军的姿态。侵黎美军总司令霍洛威今天宣布，在黎巴嫩的海军陆战队第二团第二营将要在13日开始撤退。
    据美联社说，美国这个行动显然是企图影响联大紧急特别会议上关于中东问题的辩论。
    据合众国际社透露：“美国国务院曾经要求国防部在13日联大开会之前至少象征性地从黎巴嫩撤出一些美国军队”。同时“有一营换防的海军陆战队准备启程前往地中海。不过这一营军队可能留在地中海军舰上，如有需要随时可以出动。这样一来既可以有减少在黎巴嫩的美军的效果，而又不致于减少地中海美军的总兵力”。很清楚，撤退一个营，又开来一个营“可以随时出动”，这就是美国的“象征性”的撤军把戏！
    合众国际社还援引美国军方人士的话说，现在驻在黎巴嫩的这一营海军陆战队早该“轮换”返回美国了。它回国的日期曾经两次因故推迟，第二次就是在美军开始在黎巴嫩登陆的时候。
