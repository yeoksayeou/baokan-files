Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th—Hong Kong dispatch: Huang Wenfang and thirteen other journalists from the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post, today jointly sent a telegram to the All-China Journalists Association in Beijing protesting the Hong Kong British authorities' hostile attitude towards the Chinese people's journalistic endeavors and their violent acts that endanger the personal safety of journalists.

The telegram reads as follows: On August 26th, when the Hong Kong British authorities' armed police forcibly sealed off the Chung Wah Middle School, they barbarically beat reporters who were on the scene to cover the event.

We thirteen reporters were taking pictures of the Hong Kong British police forcibly expelling teachers, staff, and students from the Chung Wah Middle School. The British police, fearing that we would capture the truth of their violent acts, obstructed our work and attempted to forcibly prohibit news reporters from various newspapers from interviewing. They then further used batons and fists to brutally beat us. Ta Kung Pao reporter Zhang Guangliang was injured on the spot, and the camera he was carrying was snatched and thrown to the ground and crushed. Wen Wei Po reporter Huang Yonghe, Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Wenfang, and New Evening Post reporter Li Xusheng were also beaten.

This violent act by the Hong Kong British police authorities, which infringes upon the personal freedom of the Chinese people and forcibly interferes with the right of Chinese journalists to interview, has aroused the indignation and protest of Chinese journalists and compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong. The crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in being hostile to the Chinese people's journalistic endeavors and persecuting Chinese journalists will undoubtedly be severely condemned by journalists throughout China and the world. We are waging a resolute struggle to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests.

We hereby telegraph you to report the incident, hoping that you will forward it to the International Organization of Journalists, uphold justice, safeguard the right of journalists to interview, and condemn the Hong Kong British authorities for their violent acts that endanger the personal safety of journalists.

Huang Wenfang and Situ Qiang, reporters from the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency; Zhang Guangliang, Wang Jin, Huang Ziping, Wan Mingguang, Li Qishen, and Huangpu, reporters from Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao; Huang Yonghe, Chen Bingzhuang, and Ye Qinghua, reporters from Hong Kong Wen Wei Po; Wang Nianzu and Li Xusheng, reporters from Hong Kong New Evening Post.

　　中国记者采访权利不容侵犯
    香港十三名身受暴行的记者提出严重抗议
    新华社广州26日电　香港消息：新华通讯社香港分社、香港大公报、文汇报和新晚报记者黄文放等十三人，今日联名致电北京中华全国新闻工作者协会抗议香港英国当局敌视中国人民新闻事业、伤害新闻工作者人身安全的暴行。
    电文如下：8月26日香港英国当局的武装警察在用武力封闭中华中学时，竟蛮横殴打在场采访的各报记者。
    我们十三个记者当时正在采摄香港英警强力驱逐中华中学教职员及学生出校舍的镜头，英国警察由于害怕我们摄照他们的暴行真相，就阻挠我们工作的进行，意图强制禁止各报新闻记者的采访，继而进一步用警棍和拳头对我们横加殴打，当场就有大公报记者张光亮被打受伤，张光亮所携照像机也被夺去掷落地下踩坏。文汇报记者黄永和、新华社记者黄文放和新晚报记者李栩生等也同遭毒打。
    香港英国警察当局这种侵犯中国人民人身自由、武力干涉中国记者采访权利的暴行，已引起香港中国记者和各界同胞的愤慨和抗议。香港英国当局敌视中国人民的新闻事业，迫害中国新闻记者的罪行，无疑是会受到全中国和世界新闻工作者的严厉指责的，我们正在为维护我们的正当权益而进行坚决的斗争。
    兹特电你会，报告事件经过，尚希转电国际新闻工作者协会，主持正义，维护新闻工作者的采访权利，谴责香港英国当局伤害新闻工作者人身安全的暴行。
