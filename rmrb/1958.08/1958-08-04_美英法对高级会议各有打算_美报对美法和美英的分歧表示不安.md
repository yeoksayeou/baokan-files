Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: According to TASS, New York, August 3rd: TASS correspondent Vilichansky reports: Some American newspapers are expressing anxiety over the divisions between Western countries regarding the issue of a high-level meeting.
  The "Christian Science Monitor" acknowledges that the attempt by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council to formulate a common position on the issue of a summit meeting "has been deadlocked after heated debates by the representatives of the fifteen member states of this treaty organization." These debates show that "it is impossible to reach a common agreement."
  The "New York Herald Tribune" published a comprehensive report today comparing the attitudes of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France on issues such as the location, timing, procedures, number of participants, and agenda of the meeting. The report proves that the attitudes of the United States and France are virtually divergent on all issues. The newspaper criticizes De Gaulle for undermining the position of his partners by opposing the plans of the United States and Britain.
  Reports from Paris indicate that De Gaulle is unlikely to participate in the Security Council meeting held according to American plans and will send the Foreign Minister to attend the meeting. This will create more procedural difficulties for the meeting held according to American plans, because the French representative presides over the Security Council in August. If this happens, the heads of government will have to hold a meeting under the chairmanship of a Foreign Minister.
  The newspapers also pointed out that differences exist between the United States and Britain on procedural issues and on the substantive issues to be discussed. According to American commentators, Britain advocates holding a summit meeting in parallel with a formal meeting of the Security Council. Dulles, on the other hand, advocates that, in addition to the Security Council meeting, the exchange of views between the heads of government can only be conducted in the "lounge."
  Commentators point out that the British government, under pressure from the opposition and public opinion, hopes to show some sincerity in seeking a solution to the Middle East crisis. However, the United States puts so-called "indirect aggression" first, which is clearly an attempt to turn the high-level meeting into a platform for "Cold War" propaganda.
  Observers believe that the newspapers today published an authorized message saying that the United States is prepared to participate in another summit meeting that discusses issues unrelated to the Middle East in the near future. This approach is mainly to prompt the British government to completely abandon its original position on the procedural issues of the Security Council's special summit meeting.

### 美英法对高级会议各有打算  美报对美法和美英的分歧表示不安

    美英法对高级会议各有打算
    美报对美法和美英的分歧表示不安
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约3日讯：塔斯社记者维利昌斯基报道：美国一些报纸对西方国家在有关高级会议问题上的分歧表示不安。
      “基督教科学箴言报”承认，北大西洋集团理事会想对政府首脑会议问题拟定一种共同的立场，这种尝试“在这个条约组织的十五个成员国的代表经过热烈辩论以后陷于僵局”，这些辩论表明，“要达到共同的协议是不可能的”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”今天刊载了一篇综合报道，把美、苏、英、法四国对会议的地点、时间、程序、参加者的数目和议程等问题的态度作了一番比较。这篇报道证明，美国和法国的态度实际上在一切问题上都是有分歧的。报纸责备戴高乐用反对美英计划的方式破坏自己伙伴的地位。
    巴黎的消息指出，戴高乐很可能不会参加按照美国的计划举行的安理会会议，他将派外长参加这一会议。这样，将给按照美国计划举行的会议造成更多礼节上的困难，因为8月份在安理会主持会议的是法国代表，如果这种情况出现，政府首脑将不得不在一名外长的主持下举行会议。
    各报还指出，美国和英国之间在程序问题上和在所要讨论的实质问题上也存在着分歧。据美国评论员的意见，英国主张政府首脑会议与安全理事会的正式会议平行举行。而杜勒斯主张，除了安理会会议以外，政府首脑的交换意见只能在“休息室”进行。
    据评论员指出，英国主张在安全理事会特别会议上将不用表决方式解决问题，会议只研究政府首脑事先协商好的建议。而美国则继续坚持安全理事会的“正式程序”以便开动它的表决机器（包括蒋介石分子和依附美国的那些国家的代表的票）来阻挠会议的进展。
    有人认为，英国政府迫于反对派和舆论的压力，希望表示一下寻求解决中东危机的某种诚意。但是，美国把所谓“间接侵略”提在第一位，这显然是企图把高级会议变成进行“冷战”宣传的讲坛。
    观察家认为，各报今天刊载了一项有人授意的消息说，美国准备在不久的将来参加另一个讨论与中东没有关系的问题的政府首脑会议，这个作法主要是为了促使英国政府彻底离开它原先在政府首脑安理会特别会议程序问题上的立场。
