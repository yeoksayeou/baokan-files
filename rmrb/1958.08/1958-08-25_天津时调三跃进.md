　　Three Great Leaps Forward in Tianjin Shidiao
　　Shen Pengnian
    I was greatly surprised and had many thoughts after hearing the Tianjin Shidiao "Overturning Rivers and Seas" at the first National Quyi Performance Convention.
    When I was a child, my home was near the Tianjin West Railway Station, and next door was the gathering point for the porters, then called "Jiaohang Xiachu." Every hot day, after work in the evening, the sad songs of Shidiao would drift over the wall with the sound of the Sanxian. Gradually, I learned that Shidiao sang about "Bachelor Crying for His Wife," "Stepmother Beating Children," and "Qinlou Autumn Sorrow," mostly things that made people sad. It was difficult to understand why people who toiled hard at the water and land terminals loved to sing and listen to these sad songs.
    After liberation, after studying the Party's literary and art policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," I often worried about Tianjin Shidiao. The artistic characteristics of Shidiao are: sorrowful, charming, and crisp. The first word is "sorrowful," "charming" means euphemistic, and "crisp" is just a characteristic of the pronunciation of Tianjin dialect. How could such a great lament be used to sing about the joyful new life?
    Not long after liberation, Tianjin Shidiao artists were influenced by the new Quyi movement and sang new lyrics. The form remained unchanged, but the content and tune would be incongruous when new lyrics were filled in. However, this bold attempt was still a leap forward and a beginning of reform. Since 1954, under the leadership of the Party and the encouragement of the masses, Tianjin Shidiao artists and Quyi authors have made another leap forward. New life content broke through the original form, and the singing, accompaniment, and performance of Shidiao have undergone great reforms. Excellent pieces such as "Smashing the Watermelon," "Making Suggestions," and "Thinking of Something" were warmly welcomed and became new repertory pieces. These programs swept away the melancholy and dejected mood of the old Shidiao, and were lively and cheerful, making people feel happy. It is unnecessary to worry about the development of Shidiao. As a beautiful lyrical song loved by workers, peasants, and soldiers, Shidiao will undoubtedly have great development. But can Shidiao express stronger content?
    The laboring people of Tianjin, in the Great Leap Forward, responded to the Party's call and began to harness the Haihe River in the early summer of this year, to separate the clear from the turbid and the fresh from the salt, which would be a great and arduous communist project. Hundreds of thousands of laboring troops fought hard day and night, which was such a magnificent labor painting. The laboring people demanded that Shidiao sing about this struggle to conquer nature, and the artists were also duty-bound, resulting in another leap forward, producing the convention program "Overturning Rivers and Seas." Listen! What a sonorous communist voice: Red flags are flying all over the sky, and great rivers are opened up on the flat ground. The masses on the ground are full of energy, and sweat floats boats. Not only must we go to heaven to pick the sun and the moon, but also go to the sea to make trouble in the dragon's palace!
    Hearing this program, I was really shocked! It is humorous and funny when mocking the immortals, and bold and magnificent when praising labor. The expression of the voice is so varied, and so accurate and powerful. How could one have imagined that it developed from the sorrowful and desolate old Shidiao! The fundamental changes in the people's lives have determined the development of art, and the Great Leap Forward in production and construction has driven the Great Leap Forward in art. Artists who sincerely listen to the Party and sincerely serve the laboring people will surely achieve success in art. The three leaps forward of Shidiao have reached the new level of "Overturning Rivers and Seas," which once again proves this truth.

### 天津时调三跃进

　　天津时调三跃进
　　沈彭年
    在首届全国曲艺会演大会上听到了天津时调“翻江倒海”，大吃一惊，感想很多。
    小时候家住在天津西车站，隔墙就是搬运工人的集合点，那时叫“脚行下处”。每到热天，工人傍晚收工之后，三弦一响时调的悲凉歌声就飞过墙来。渐渐知道时调唱的是“光棍哭妻”、“后娘打孩子”、“秦楼悲秋”，大多是叫人听了难过的事。听了难过，水旱码头卖苦力气的人又这么爱唱爱听，这个道理，当时是想不通的。
    解放后，学习了党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺政策之后，常为天津时调发愁。时调的艺术特点叫作：悲、媚、脆。头一个字就是个“悲”，“媚”是委宛的意思，
  “脆”不过是天津话吐字发音的特点。这样一个大悲调怎么能用来歌唱充满欢乐的新生活？
    解放不久，天津时调艺人受到新曲艺运动的影响，就唱了新词。形式不动，填进新词，内容和腔调会有不谐和之处，可是这种大胆的尝试，仍然是一个跃进，是改革的开端。1954年以来天津时调艺人和曲艺作者在党的领导和群众鼓舞之下，再来了一个跃进。新的生活内容冲破了原有的形式，时调的唱腔、伴奏、表演都有了很大的改革。“摔西瓜”、“提意见”、“想心事”等优秀曲目受到热烈欢迎，成为新的保留节目。这些节目一扫老时调那种忧郁消沉的情调，活泼爽朗，叫人听了愉快。为时调的发展担心是不必要的了，时调做为优美的抒情歌会为工农兵喜爱，会有很大的发展是无疑的了。但时调是不是能表现更强烈的内容呢？
    大跃进的天津劳动人民响应党的号召，今年夏初动手治理海河，要叫海河清浊分流，咸淡分家，这是伟大艰巨的共产主义工程，几十万劳动大军日夜苦战，是多么雄伟的劳动画图。劳动人民要求时调唱出来这一场征服自然的斗争，艺术家也责无旁贷，又一个跃进，产生了“翻江倒海”这个会演节目。听！多么嘹亮的共产主义声音：红旗满天飘，平地开大川。地上万众干劲足，汗水漂起了船。既要上天摘日月，更要下海闹龙潭！
    听到这个节目，真是大吃一惊！嘲笑神仙时，幽默风趣；歌颂劳动时，豪迈雄浑。声音的表情这样富于变化，又这样准确有力，怎么能想得到它是由悲怨凄凉的老时调发展而来的呢！人民生活的根本变化决定了艺术的发展，生产建设的大跃进带动了艺术的大跃进。真心听党的话，真心为劳动人民服务的艺术家一定会在艺术上获得成就。时调三个跃进，达到了“翻江倒海”这个新水平，又一次证明了这个真理。
