Xinhua News Agency, August 21st:

    The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China was held recently. The meeting studied and discussed the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, reviewed thinking based on the Party's general line for building socialism, exchanged experiences in the work of the League since the Great Leap Forward, and discussed current work. This was a meeting for in-depth rectification and a meeting to promote the more vigorous development of the youth movement.

    The plenary session fully affirmed the achievements made by the Communist Youth League and the youth of the country under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels since the Great Leap Forward. The plenary session pointed out that the main tasks of the Communist Youth League in the future are: to unite and educate the broad masses of young people, to give fuller play to the shock force role of the entire League and the youth of the country, and to strive to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. To this end, under the unified leadership and deployment of the Party, League organizations at all levels should continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of young people. Carry out the study of Marxist-Leninist political theory, taking Mao Zedong's works as the guiding principle, throughout the League and among young people. Among young people in schools, further transform thinking by studying and implementing the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

    The Communist Youth League should lead the broad masses of young people to enthusiastically respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to "fight hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of our country" with practical actions, and should continue to unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of young people on the front lines of technological revolution and productive labor. Among rural youth, carry out high-yield experiments, tool reforms, basic farmland construction, and various shock activities. Among youth in industry, commerce, and transportation, conscientiously promote advanced technologies, widely carry out "all-rounder" activities, and mobilize youth to actively participate in establishing local industries. Organize youth to actively participate in the cultural revolution. Continue to mobilize youth to actively participate in the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests. In institutions of higher learning and secondary schools, conscientiously implement the work-study program. Strengthen the construction of the League's grassroots organizations, continue to complete the rectification of the League, and systematically recruit a group of young activists who have emerged in the Great Leap Forward into the League. Enhance the League's core role among young people. League committees at the county level and above should also, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, carry out the rectification campaign to the end.

    At the end of the meeting, Comrade Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, made a summary on behalf of the Standing Committee. The summary pointed out that during this period, the entire League and the youth of the country stood at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward, and the work was done well and with achievements. It must be pointed out that these achievements are fundamentally due to the correct leadership of our Party and the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction. We should first give credit to the Party and the people, and we must not have any complacency or exaggerate the role of young people and the League. Our work also has many shortcomings and errors, and we should always remain humble and prudent, continue to carry forward the style of being diligent, conscientious, energetic, daring to think and act, continue to go all out, aim high, and more effectively complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    The summary especially pointed out that in recent years, the Communist Youth League has faithfully and actively implemented the Party's line, principles, and policies, and has generally done a good job in ensuring the Party's leadership. This is the fundamental reason why our work has been able to develop and avoid major errors. The summary stated that Party member cadres working in the Youth League must further strengthen their Party spirit and firmly establish the idea of ​​obeying the Party's leadership among all League cadres and all League members. It should make all League cadres and all League members more clearly aware that the Party's leadership is the lifeline of the League and the most fundamental guarantee for us to do all our work well. The entire work of our League is, in the final analysis, for one purpose, that is, to educate and lead young people to always follow the Party and to struggle to realize the Party's program and the Party's guidelines and tasks in various periods. Without the leadership of the Party, the work of the League would lose its "commander" and would lose its way. In order to enable the League's work to obtain the Party's timely and close leadership and to be more conducive to the local League committees carrying out work in accordance with local conditions and circumstances, the plenary session believes that in the dual leadership of the League's system leadership and the leadership of the Party committee at the same level, the principle of taking the leadership of the Party committee at the same level as the main principle should be adhered to. All League cadres should consciously become docile tools of the Party and loyal servants of the people, and all words and deeds of League cadres must conform to the interests of the Party.

    The summary also emphasized that all the work of the League must proceed from the overall interests of the Party and the people. Youth are a part of the masses of the people, and the youth movement must be combined with the national movement. The Youth League should always inspire and educate young people with the achievements of the Party and the achievements of the whole people, and constantly strengthen the Party's influence among young people and enhance young people's infinite trust in the Party. Youth are an active force in all tasks. Under the leadership of the Party, it is completely necessary to adopt methods and forms suitable for the characteristics of youth to mobilize and organize youth to play a shock role and a leading role, but at the same time, attention must be paid to obtaining the support and help of adults and the elderly. It should be recognized that young people are together with adults and the elderly, so that young people can combine learning and originality, which not only meets the needs of socialist construction, but also is conducive to the growth of young people.

    The plenary session also made a resolution calling on members of the Communist Youth League and young people to study Marxism-Leninism and study Mao Zedong's works, and decided to publish selected works of Marxist-Leninist classics and Mao Zedong's works suitable for young people to read.

    The plenary session earnestly discussed the work of the Young Pioneers, made a "Resolution on Improving the Work of the Young Pioneers and Carrying out the Communist Children's Movement," and passed the new rules.

　　共青团中央三届三次全会强调指出
    党的领导是团的生命线
    据新华社21日讯  共青团中央在最近举行了三届三中全会。会议学习和讨论了党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的文件，根据党的建设社会主义的总路线检查了思想，交流了大跃进以来团的工作经验，并且讨论了当前工作。这是一次深入整风的会议，是一次促进青年运动更加蓬勃发展的会议。
    全会充分地肯定了大跃进以来共青团和全国青年在党中央和各级党委的领导下所获得的成绩。全会指出，今后共青团的主要任务是：团结和教育广大青年，更加充分地发挥全团和全国青年的突击作用，为贯彻实现鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线而奋斗。为此，各级团的组织在党的统一领导和部署下，应当继续加强青年的政治思想教育。在全团和青年中开展以毛泽东著作为纲的马克思列宁主义的政治理论学习。在学校青年中，通过学习和贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育同生产劳动相结合的方针，进一步改造思想。
    共青团应当带领广大青年，以实际行动热烈响应党中央和毛主席的“苦战三年，基本改变我国面貌”的伟大号召，应当继续放手发挥广大青年在技术革命和生产劳动战线上的积极性和创造性。在农村青年中，开展高产试验、工具改革、农田基本建设和各项突击活动。在工业、商业和交通运输业青年中，认真推广先进技术，广泛开展“多面手”活动，并发动青年积极参加兴办地方工业。应当组织青年积极参加文化革命。继续发动青年积极参加扫盲工作，协助党普及小学教育，办好各种民办学校、业余学校，有计划有准备地推行半工半读的学习制度和劳动制度。继续发动青少年积极参加以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。在高等和中等学校中，认真实行勤工俭学。应当加强团的基层建设，继续完成整团工作，有计划地吸收一批在大跃进中涌现的青年积极分子入团。提高团在青年中的核心作用。县以上各级团委，还应当在党委的统一领导下，把整风进行到底。
    会议最后由团中央第一书记胡耀邦同志代表常委会作了总结。总结指出：这个时期，全团和全国青年站在了大跃进的前面，工作是做得好的，有成绩的。必须指出，这些成绩的取得，根本上是由于我们党正确领导的结果，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。我们应当首先归功于党和人民，不能有任何骄傲自满情绪，不应夸大青年和团的作用。我们的工作也还有许多缺点和错误，我们应该永远保持谦虚谨慎，继续发扬勤勤恳恳、踏踏实实、朝气蓬勃、敢想敢作的作风，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，更有成效地去完成党交给我们的光荣任务。
    总结特别指出：几年来，共青团执行党的方针路线是忠实的积极的，对保证党的领导一般是做得好的。这正是我们工作能够发展和避免重大错误的根本所在。总结中说，在青年团工作的党员干部必须进一步增强党性，并且在全团干部和全体团员中牢固地树立服从党的领导的思想。应当使全团干部和全体团员更加明确认识，党的领导是团的生命线，是我们做好一切工作最根本的保证。我们团的全部工作，归根结底都是为了一个目的，那就是教育和带领青年永远跟着党走，为实现党的纲领和党在各个时期的方针任务而斗争。离开党的领导，团的工作就失去了“统帅”，就会迷失方向。为着使团的工作更能取得党的及时的密切的领导，更有利于各地团委因地因时制宜地进行工作，全会认为，在团的系统领导和同级党委领导的双重领导中，应该坚持以同级党委领导为主的原则。所有团的干部都应当自觉的成为党的驯服的工具和人民的忠实的勤务员，团的干部的一切言行都必须符合党的利益。
    总结还着重指出：团的一切工作都必须从党和人民的全局利益出发。青年是人民群众的一部分，青年运动必须和全民运动相结合。青年团应当时时刻刻以党的成就、全民的成就去鼓舞教育青年，不断加强党在青年中的影响，增强青年对党的无限信任。青年是各项工作中的一支积极力量，在党的领导下，采用适合青年特点的方法和形式，去动员和组织青年发挥突击作用和带头作用，这是完全必要的，但是必须同时注意取得成年和老年的支持和帮助。应当认识，青年同成年和老年在一起，使青年能把学习和独创结合起来，既符合社会主义建设的需要，也有利于青年的成长。
    全会还作出了号召共青团员和青年学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的决议，并决定出版适合青年阅读的马克思列宁主义经典著作和毛泽东著作的选本。
    全会认真地讨论了少年先锋队的工作，作出了“关于改进少先队工作，开展共产主义少年儿童运动”的决议，并通过了新的队章。
