The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Jinmen Island,
Their old evils unchanged, devoid of humanity,
Frequently harass our coast,
Shelling our villages and towns,
Threatening the lives and property of the people,
Everyone hates the bandit troops to the core.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army,
Defends the country and protects the people,
If the enemy dares to invade,
We will resolutely eliminate them without mercy.

Speaking of the 23rd, at 5:30 PM,
The red artillery displayed its power, bombarding Jinmen.
Only the sound of shells whistling could be heard,
Each shot fired with precision,
Directly hitting Jinmen Island with fierce flames,
Directly silencing the Chiang troops' artillery positions,
Directly throwing the Chiang troops' command system into disarray,
Directly causing the Chiang troops to scream for their parents in chaos.

A transport ship hurriedly tried to escape,
Hey, a shell hit it, leaving it stranded like a dead fish in the bay.
This battle frightened the Taiwan Chiang bandits, making their hair stand on end,
The next day they sent warships again to send troops to Jinmen.
It is truly: heaven has a road they refuse to take, hell has no gate yet they seek disaster themselves.
The red artillery shouted, "Well done!"
Such a large target delivered itself to our door.

Boom! Boom! The sound of artillery shook like thunder,
Directly causing the sea to churn and the sky to darken,
Shells fell one after another in front and behind the enemy ships,
Scaring the Chiang troops out of their wits, losing their senses,
The enemy ships tucked their tails and tried to escape,
Hey, trying to escape is impossible.

Our torpedo boats appeared on the sea,
Chasing after them like lightning,
Whoosh! Two torpedoes were launched with precision,
Two enemy ships, one damaged and one sunk!

It is truly:
If the enemy dares to provoke,
Give him a taste of our might.
The artillery and navy cooperate well,
Eliminating enemy ships and making meritorious contributions.

　　给他颜色瞧一瞧（金钱板）
　　陈涛
　　金门岛上蒋匪军，
　　旧恶不改失人性，
　　经常沿海来骚扰，
　　炮击我村庄和城镇，
　　人民生命财产受威胁，
　　提起匪军人人恨。
　　中国人民解放军，
　　保卫国家保人民，
　　敌人胆敢来侵犯，
　　坚决消灭不容情。
　　话说二十三日五点三十分，
　　红色炮兵大显威风轰金门。
　　只听得炮弹呼呼响，
　　一发一发射的准，
　　直轰得金门岛上烟火烈，
　　直轰得蒋军炮兵阵地没了声音，
　　直轰得蒋军指挥系统乱了阵，
　　直轰得蒋军们喊爹叫娘乱纷纷。
　　一艘运输舰慌慌忙忙想逃命，
　　嘿，一发炮弹打得它像条死鱼湾内停。
　　这一仗吓得台湾蒋匪头发晕，
　　第二天又派军舰送兵到金门。
　　这正是天堂有路他不走，地狱无门他自把祸寻。
　　红色炮兵叫声来的好，
　　这么大的靶子自动送上了门。
　　轰隆轰隆炮声如雷震，
　　直打得海水翻滚天发昏，
　　炮弹一颗一颗直往敌舰前后落，
　　吓得蒋军失掉七魄少三魂，
　　敌舰夹起尾巴想逃命，
　　嘿，要想逃走不得行。
　　海面上出现了我们的鱼雷艇，
　　风驰电掣随后跟，
　　嗖嗖两个鱼雷放得准，
　　敌舰两艘一个伤来一个沉！
　　正是：
　　敌人胆敢把衅挑，
　　给他颜色瞧一瞧。
　　炮兵海军配合好，
　　消灭敌舰立功劳。
