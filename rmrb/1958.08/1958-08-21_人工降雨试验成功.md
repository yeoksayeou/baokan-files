Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th August. On the afternoon of August 8th, agricultural co-operative members from Lafa and Jinbu townships in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, were busy irrigating their fields and performing other tasks, when an airplane flew overhead. The white clouds in the sky immediately turned black, and a rain began to fall. The co-operative members were soaked. Farmers spread the word, calling it a miracle. This miracle was rain created by Jilin City using an airplane to spread dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) in the clouds. By August 11th, a total of five experiments had been conducted, each with good results.

These experiments were carried out by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, using airplanes to spread dry ice in the clouds, causing the moisture in the clouds to condense rapidly. The first experiment was on August 8th. The plane ascended to 6,300 meters and spread 150 kilograms of dry ice, resulting in approximately 20 minutes of rainfall over an area of about 20 square kilometers, with a rainfall of 16 millimeters. On the 9th, from 1:52 PM to 2:10 PM, the second experiment was conducted. The plane spread 180 kilograms of dry ice in the clouds above 6,700 meters, resulting in rainfall of 12 to 30 millimeters over an area of approximately 120 square kilometers, significantly exceeding the area where dry ice was spread. The three experiments conducted on the 10th and 11th also produced good results.

The rain that fell during these experiments, verified by the meteorological station, hydrological station, and the masses, was not only quick but also windless and did not damage crops. The rain that fell during the experiments played a certain role in alleviating the local drought.

The success of the artificial rain experiment is the result of all parties giving full play to their courage to think and act, and the communist style of great collaboration, under the glorious light of the General Line. It is also one of the achievements of Jilin Province's recent vigorous drought resistance efforts. The experimental work was carried out under the personal leadership of responsible cadres of the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jilin Municipal People's Committee, and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as with the assistance of Soviet experts. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant Repair Shop, after a short period of hard work, produced dry ice, the Repair Shop of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army modified the aircraft, and the pilots also overcame difficulties in flight technology.

### 人工降雨试验成功

　　人工降雨试验成功
    新华社长春20日电  8月8日下午五点多钟，吉林省蛟河县拉法、进步等乡的农业社员们正在田间浇水和进行其他劳动，一架飞机从天空飞过之后，天空的白云立刻变成黑云，霎时间下起雨来，社员们的衣服被淋透了。农民奔走相告，称为这是奇迹。这奇迹是吉林市用飞机在云层撒干冰（固体二氧化碳）造的雨。到8月11日共进行了五次试验，每次效果都良好。
    这几次试验，是由中国人民解放军某部用飞机在云层撒干冰，使云层中的水气迅速凝结的方法进行的。8月8日是第一次试验，飞机上升到六千三百公尺时撒干冰一百五十公斤，降雨约二十分钟，降雨面积二十平方公里左右，雨量达十六公厘。9日下午一时五十二分至二时十分，进行第二次试验，飞机在六千七百公尺以上的高空云层中撒干冰一百八十公斤，结果降雨十二至三十公厘，降雨面积达一百二十平方公里左右，大大超过撒干冰的面积。10日，11日进行的三次试验，效果也良好。
    这几次，试验中下的雨，经过气象台、水文站和群众的验证，不但雨下的快，而且不带风，不损坏庄稼。试验中下的雨对缓和当地旱象起了一定作用。
    人工造雨试验成功，是在总路线光辉的照耀下，各方面发挥敢想敢干和大协作的共产主义风格的结果；也是吉林省最近大力抗旱中的一个收获。试验工作是在中共吉林市委、吉林市人民委员会和中国人民解放军某部等单位负责干部亲自领导、以及苏联专家帮助下进行的。吉林化肥厂修理厂经过短时间的苦战，制成了干冰，解放军某部修理厂改装了飞机，飞行员也克服了飞行技术上的困难。
