　　People Who Shine Brightly

    The masses in Wei County, Hebei Province, have utilized biogas to build over 500 power plants and tens of thousands of biogas stations and biogas pits. Farmers are using biogas for cooking and lighting.

    Wei County has no special conditions for developing biogas. Please take a look at the methods used by the two girls in the photograph to produce biogas, and take a look at how they use reeds, bamboo poles, and even chicken and duck intestines to replace rubber tubes. They have neither superior material conditions nor sophisticated technical conditions, but they have built from scratch, from small to large, and developed it vigorously, making the countryside shine brightly. This is the brilliance emitted by wisdom, the energy brought by hard work! Our rural readers, after seeing the example of Wei County, should start working! We are all people who shine brightly!

　　大放光明的人
    河北威县群众利用沼气搞了五百多个发电厂，搞了成千成万的沼气站，沼气堆，农民作饭照明都用上了沼气。
    威县办沼气事业没有什么特殊条件。请大家看看照片上两个姑娘制取沼气的办法吧，请大家看看他们用苇子、竹竿甚至鸡鸭肠子来代替胶皮管的办法吧，他们一无优厚的物质条件，二无精湛的技术条件，但是他们从无到有，从小到大，大办特办，使农村大放光明。这是智慧发出的光辉，是干劲带来的能源！我们农村的读者看了威县的样子就动起手来吧，我们都是大放光明的人！
