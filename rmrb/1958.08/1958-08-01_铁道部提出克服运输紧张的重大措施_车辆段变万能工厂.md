Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 31st - The Ministry of Railways convened a National Technical Revolution On-Site Conference for Vehicle Departments in Taiyuan City from July 25th to 29th. The conference proposed that railway vehicle departments should not only be able to repair vehicles, but also manufacture them; not only be able to build machines, but also smelt steel. At the same time, they should develop various necessary small-scale industries, so that vehicle depots, which previously only performed maintenance work, can be developed into all-purpose factories.

The representatives from seventeen railway administrations including Shanghai, Beijing, Taiyuan, and Shenyang, who attended the conference, unanimously agreed that this is a major measure to solve the problem of transportation strain in the current great leap forward in production.

With the high-speed development of China's socialist construction, passenger and freight transport volume has risen sharply. At present, a situation has emerged where transportation capacity cannot keep up with the growth of transport volume, and transport volume will continue to increase in the future. How to solve this contradiction? The conference believes that the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of railway vehicle workers across the country should be organized to vigorously engage in technical revolution, boldly build new vehicles, smelt steel, improve vehicle repair capabilities and repair quality, develop new vehicle technologies, and improve vehicle operation conditions. Next year, in addition to medium and annual repairs, the vehicle department will also undertake all the repair and new vehicle manufacturing tasks equivalent to those of sixteen large factories in the past.

After discussion, the conference determined the specific measures for vehicle departments to vigorously engage in technical revolution: (1) Adjust the levels of vehicle depots, self-reliantly and rapidly solve the problem of insufficient equipment, materials, and accessories, and learn technology from factories to mobilize workers to improve the technical level of vehicle repair and manufacturing. (2) Improve the quality of vehicle repair, strengthen train maintenance, improve the technical condition of vehicle operation, and ensure safe driving. At the same time, gradually realize the mechanization and electrification of the vehicle depot production process. (3) Vigorously train technical workers and cadres. (4) Carry out socialist large-scale cooperation between bureaus, between depots, between departments, and between inside and outside the railway system. (5) Reduce vehicle weight, increase carrying capacity, increase train traction, and adopt new braking devices; extensively develop automation and electrical equipment on trains to improve work efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure driving safety.

    铁道部提出克服运输紧张的重大措施
    车辆段变万能工厂
    据新华社太原31日电　铁道部7月25日到29日在太原市召开全国车辆部门技术革命现场会议，提出铁路车辆部门要既能修车，又能造车，既能造机器，又能炼钢铁，同时要发展各种必要的小型工业，使过去只能做维修工作的车辆段发展成为万能工厂。
    参加这次会议的上海、北京、太原、沈阳等十七个铁路管理局的代表一致认为，这是解决当前生产大跃进中运输紧张问题的重大措施。
    随着我国社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，客货运输量直线上升，目前已经出现了运输力量跟不上运输量增长的情况，今后运量还会继续增长。如何解决这个矛盾呢？会议认为，应当把全国铁路车辆职工冲天的革命干劲与无限的智慧组织起来，大闹技术革命，大胆地造新车、炼钢铁、提高修车能力和修车质量，发展车辆新技术，改善车辆运用状况。明年车辆部门所担当的任务除中修和年修外，还要担当相当于过去十六个大工厂的全部修理和造新车的任务。
    经过讨论，会议确定了车辆部门大闹技术革命的具体措施：（一）调整车辆段的等级，自力更生地迅速解决设备和材料配件不足的问题，并且向工厂学习技术，发动职工提高修造车辆的技术水平。（二）提高修车质量，加强列车检修，改善车辆的运用技术状况，保证安全行车。同时，逐步实现车辆段生产过程机械化和电气化。（三）大力培养技术工人和干部。（四）开展局与局、段与段、部门与部门、路内与路外的社会主义大协作。（五）降低车辆自重，增加载重量，提高列车牵引强度，采用新型制动装置；在列车上大量发展自动化、电气化设备，以提高工作效率，降低成本，保证行车安全。
