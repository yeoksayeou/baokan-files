    New Pursuits
    – Travel Notes on the Dongjiang and Hanjiang Rivers
    By Our Correspondent Du Daozheng
    The Dongjiang and Hanjiang Rivers are two major rivers in eastern Guangdong Province. The Dongjiang River basin is the Huiyang Prefecture, and the Hanjiang River basin is the Shantou Prefecture. Before July 4th, I accompanied the provincial Party committee's inspection team on a trip there. The trip lasted nearly a month, covering three thousand miles. We rode in cars, observing the scenery at high speed, without delving deeply. However, the people's strong desire to fundamentally change their fate and their heroic and creative labor were palpable and visible everywhere. The following are some very superficial impressions that the reporter gathered along the way, written in chronological order of the trip.
    Fruit After Meals
    June 7th, a quiet evening. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and comrades from the provincial inspection team sat barefoot on a small hill in the Jima Village of Boluo County. After discussing production with a dozen village and commune cadres, they talked about life. Comrade Tao Zhu asked: What do you think communist life will be like? Li Hui, the director of the commune, hesitated for a moment and then replied, "First, the commune members will all live in barracks-like houses; second..." Several comrades from the province couldn't help but laugh when they heard this. Comrade Tao Zhu said, "Don't laugh, let him continue. What's the second?" Li Hui said, "Second, the commune members will all have fruit after meals." This made everyone present laugh. Comrade Tao Zhu also laughed and said, "Good! You have ideals! They can be realized very soon!" Later, Li Hui also mentioned other things such as electric lights in every household, everyone attending middle school, and a yield of 1,500 jin of grain per mu. The barracks in Li Hui's mind are those rows of neat and beautiful military camps. Fruit after meals is a lifestyle enjoyed by wealthy landlords before liberation, a few fruits to savor after a meal. Barracks and fruit after meals were probably seen by Li Hui and his fellow farmers, so they considered them the most ideal life.
    Of course, in a communist society, farmers will certainly not live in barracks, but in houses that are many times more beautiful and comfortable than barracks. After meals, they will not just have fruit, but countless good things. The barracks and fruit after meals in Li Hui's ideal, as Comrade Tao Zhu said, are living requirements that can be realized very soon. Agricultural cooperatives in the Chaoshan Plain and Xingning County are already preparing to build and improve farmers' houses on a large scale after the autumn harvest.
    Tractors
    On June 9th, the inspection team arrived at Jiesheng Township in Haifeng County, near the South China Sea. It was getting late, and as we climbed up a rocky hill, a clay tiger with a white forehead emerged from behind the Wudao Temple opposite. This is probably a unique custom in the South. Curiosity prompted me and another comrade to take a closer look. Three young men with floral-patterned headscarves were standing next to the temple. Before we could speak, the young men spoke first. They asked if we were there to show movies for the village? We said that we were from the provincial inspection team. This made them extremely happy, and they repeatedly asked us to bring tractors for them. As we walked away from the hill, the young men were still standing by the temple, earnestly shouting, "Tractors!"
    Think about what kind of emotion, what kind of call this is. Wherever the inspection team went, we could hear such requests: "Give us tractors!" "Give us electric motors!" "Give us cars!" The dozen or so agricultural cooperatives we visited had public accumulation funds ranging from as high as 200,000 yuan to as low as tens of thousands of yuan. Commune cadres said: The farmers want to use this money to buy machines.
    10,000 Jin Per Mu
    This requires recalling a past event.
    Last December, during the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress, a forum for directors of agricultural cooperatives was held. I was present at this meeting. At the meeting, Comrade Tao Zhu asked, "Can we create a field that yields 3,000 jin of grain per mu in a year next year?" He added, "Even one mu would be good!" The directors of the cooperatives looked at each other and smiled, remaining silent for a long time, not daring to agree. In the end, although they agreed, it was very reluctant.
    Only half a year has passed, and now when you look at the situation below, my goodness, the test plots for 10,000 jin per mu and the high-yield fields for several thousand jin that have been established or are being planned everywhere, as well as various high-yield experimental fields for crops, are like flowers blooming all over the South. In Chao'an County alone, there are 600 mu of experimental fields for late rice planned to yield 5,000 jin per mu, 20,000 mu for 3,000 jin, and 100,000 mu for 2,000 jin. It is estimated that there are more than 1.1 million mu of high-yield experimental fields in the Shantou Prefecture. Those running the experimental fields and high-yield fields are no longer just a few key township and commune cadres, but thousands upon thousands of Party members, League members, activists, and ordinary farmers. As the car passed through the northern part of the Shantou and Huiyang Prefectures, high-yield experimental fields with wooden signs could be seen everywhere along the road.
    Is it a Cow? Or a Pig?
    On June 12th, when Comrade Tao Zhu and cadres from the famous Chenqiao Commune in Chao'an County were talking, the commune director said, "We are not only experimenting with high-yield rice, but also experimenting with high-yield pigs!" He continued, "We have two pigs, each with a trial feeding target of 1,000 jin." Comrade Tao Zhu was both surprised and pleased when he heard this and said, "A 1,000-jin pig is not a pig, but a cow! Take us to see them later!"
    Not far southeast of the village, we arrived at the huge pig farm of Chenqiao Commune, which houses 6,000 pigs. The clean pigsties are lined up one after another, each divided into dozens of small rooms, with seven or eight large pig pens and ten to twenty small pig pens in each room. These two experimental pigs were kept in one of the rooms. The pigs were a little scared when they saw strangers and hid in the corner, their small, shining eyes staring at us. Their fur was smooth and shiny, both were more than three feet tall, with long legs and slightly thin bodies. They looked to be more than 300 jin each, but when the fence was removed and they were let out, they ran as lightly as piglets!
    The Desire to Invent
    On June 20th, Comrade Tao Zhu and members of the inspection team watched a demonstration of the improved "51" plow at the Yinnan Commune in Chenghai County. By simply adjusting the slope of the plowshare of the same "51" plow, the plowed land was an inch deeper. The plowman, Lin Bieren, a Party member and farmer who modified the plow, was praised by the masses as an inventor.
    Lin Bieren led everyone to visit the factory that the agricultural cooperative had specially set up for him to conduct experiments and inventions, as well as the twenty-two other types of agricultural tools that this factory had invented and improved. The factory building was about five or six rooms in size, with a thatched roof. A dozen workers were inside manufacturing parts for threshing machines according to Lin Bieren's designs, and some were rushing to make wooden beams for the modified double-wheeled, double-share plow. Local cadres introduced that a set of iron double-wheeled, double-share plow weighed more than 200 jin, and it was very difficult for the oxen to pull. Lin Bieren planned to replace the parts above with wood as much as possible to reduce the weight to dozens or hundreds of jin, and this modification work had already begun.
    Village cadres said that Comrade Lin Bieren has a great interest in invention and creation! He invented a peanut seeder two years ago, but unfortunately, he did not receive support from the commune. The commune cadres' understanding has now changed. They spent money to set up such a large factory and hired Lin Bieren as an engineer to lead the invention and creation full-time. With the factory set up, Lin Bieren's dedication has increased even more, and more and better inventions are yet to come! Lin Bieren also said with a smile: I want to make our commune realize five modernizations soon: automation of fertilizer processing; mechanization of agricultural product processing; transportation with vehicles; modernization of agricultural tools; and electrification. These five modernizations are not simple, but if we continue to work like this, it is not very difficult.
    The Interest in Art
    On July 1st, the car traveled from Xingning to Lianping, passing through Chengdong Township in Wuhua County. On the steep mountain slopes nearby, countless neat terraces were opened up. Small stones painted with white powder were embedded on the terraces to form huge slogans and doggerel poems. One poem wrote: "Socialism has many new things, cadres sent down to mountain nests, hoe is a pen, mountain is paper, writing articles on mountain slopes." Think about it, the mountain is green, the terrace soil is red, the words are snow-white, and the poem is so beautiful and romantic, what a beautiful picture this is! What an enchanting poetic realm!
    This is just a random example. Such beautiful and moving poems and paintings can be seen everywhere. It can also be clearly expressed in the people's work and life. For example, in order to protect the surface of the reservoir dam, grass needs to be planted on it. Originally, it could have been planted like weeds, but I saw that when planting grass on the dam surface of many reservoirs, they put a lot of thought and played many tricks, some in square grids, diagonal grids, herringbone shapes, braided shapes, and wavy patterns, which greatly increased the beauty of the dam surface! After moving the graves in the Chaoshan Plain this year, the rotten coffin boards dug out from the tombs were split into thin wooden rods by the people, and used to make melon trellises on the small rivers and small canals that are as dense as a net, neatly and densely arranged, extending along both sides of the river and canal. On the trellises, which stretched for several miles or dozens of miles, were covered with green leaves of various melons, blooming with yellow and white flowers; under the trellises hung green and yellow cucumbers and loofahs. Seeing this exquisite melon trellis, you would never think that it used to be disgusting coffin boards.
    If you pay attention, you can also see that farmers are becoming more particular about the colors and styles of their clothing and housing than in the past. Young men in the Chaoshan area mostly wear sky blue and black shorts, and a round-necked, short-sleeved thread shirt, with a brightly colored plaid scarf around their waist. Almost 100% of young women wear tight-fitting floral clothes. Cadres and the elderly are concerned about improving farmers' living conditions. At cadre forums in Xingning, Heyuan, Lianping, and other places, you can already hear debates about the style and color of farmers' housing in the future. Some advocate white walls, black tiles, and large green windows, to be elegant and simple; others advocate white walls, black tiles, and large red windows.
    The Change in Status
    For the first time in the countryside, I heard cadres discussing such brand-new questions: What is natural science? What is a world authority? They said: Natural science is nothing more than grasping the laws of production, maximizing the role of people, and producing the most and best things. I created a 10,000-jin mu and a 1,000-jin pig, I am a scientist, I am a world authority. From these remarks, can you still find the farmers' superstitious ideas about science and inferiority complex? Zhou Qiaoxiang, a young woman from the Chenqiao Commune in Chao'an County who was experimenting with raising 1,000-jin pigs, said to Comrade Tao Zhu, "Now we are not afraid of anything, we have a solution for everything, we only lack culture." This is the voice shouted out by the young generation in the countryside today.

    新的追求
    ——东江、韩江旅行散记
    本报记者  杜导正
    东江和韩江是广东省东部的两条大水。东江流域是惠阳专区，韩江流域是汕头专区。7月4日以前，我随省委检查团到那里跑了一趟。时间近一月，行程三千里，乘车观花，跑得飞快，看得不深。但人民群众那种从根本上革新自己命运的强烈愿望和那种英勇豪迈的创造性的劳动，却到处都可以触得到看得到。下面按先后旅行日期写的这点东西，就是记者沿途所见所闻的一些极肤浅的片断印象。
    饭后果
    6月7日，一个宁静的傍晚，中共广东省委第一书记陶铸和省检查团的同志，赤着脚坐在博罗县鸡麻地乡的小山上，和十几个乡、社干部谈完生产，又谈生活。陶铸同志问：你们看，共产主义生活是个什么样子？社主任李辉迟疑片刻以后回答说：“第一，社员都住营房那样的房子；第……”几个从省里来的同志听到这里忍不住笑了，陶铸同志说：“别笑，让他说下去，第二呢？”李辉说：“第二，社员都吃个饭后果。”这可把在座的人全逗笑了。陶铸同志也笑着说：“好！你有理想啊！很快就可以实现啊！”以后李辉还说了户户点电灯；人人上中学；每亩产粮一千五等几条别的。李辉心目中的营房，就是那些一排排整齐美观的兵营。饭后果，是解放前大地主们的一种生活享受，吃罢饭以后，尝几个水果，让胃受用一下。兵营、饭后果，李辉和他的农民弟兄大概是亲眼见过的，因此当作最理想的生活了。
    当然，共产主义社会里，农民住的绝不是营房，而是比营房漂亮、舒适多少倍的房子；饭后绝不会只吃到水果，而是数不清的好东西。李辉理想中的营房和饭后果，正像陶铸同志说的，这是很快就可以实现的生活要求。潮汕平原和兴宁县一带的农业社，已经准备在秋后大规模地新建和改进农民的房屋了。
    拖拉机
    6月9日，检查团到了海丰县靠近南海的捷胜乡。天色晚了，爬上石岗，斜对面五道庙后钻出一只土塑的白额花条虎来。这大概是南方一种特有的风俗。好奇心催促着我和另一个同志到跟前去看个仔细。庙旁站着三个腰缠花格子巾的青年。我们没开口，青年倒先开口了。问我们是不是来乡放电影的？我们说是省检查团的。这使他们乐极了，连连几次要求给他们开拖拉机来。我们下岗走远了，青年还站在庙旁恳切地高声喊着“拖拉机！”
    想想这是一种什么样的情绪，什么样的呼声。检查团到过的地方，几乎都可以听到这样的请求：“给我们拖拉机！”“给我们电动机！”“给我们汽车！”我们到过的十几个农业社，公共积累的现金有高到二十万元的，少的也有几万元。社干部说：农民想拿这些钱买机器。
    万斤亩
    这要回忆一段往事。
    去年12月，中共广东省党代表大会期间，召开过一次农业社主任座谈会。这会我是在场的。会上，陶铸同志问，“明年我们能不能创造出一块一年亩产三千斤粮食的田？”又补充一句说：“一亩也好啊！”社主任们相视而笑，沉默很久，不敢答应。最后虽然答应了，十分勉强。
    时间仅仅过了半年，这回到下边一看，好家伙，各地已办和筹办的万斤亩试验田、几千斤的高产田，各种作物的高产试验场，却像南国鲜花一样遍地都是。潮安一县，晚稻计划亩产五千斤的试验田有六百亩，三千斤的两万亩，二千斤的十万亩。汕头专区的高产试验田估计在一百一十万亩以上。办试验田，高产田的也不再是少数的几个主要乡、社干部，而是成千上万的党团员，积极分子和普通农民。汽车从汕头专区和惠阳专区北部经过，公路两旁处处看到插着木牌的高产试验田。
    是牛？还是猪？
    6月12日，陶铸同志和著名的潮安县陈桥社干部谈话时，社主任说：“我们不只试验高产稻子，还要试验高产猪呢！”接着说：“我们有两头猪，每头试养指标一千斤。”陶铸同志听了又惊讶又高兴地说道：“一千斤的猪，不是猪，而是牛了！待会领我们看看去！”
    出村往东南走不远，就到了陈桥社养着六千口猪的庞大猪场。整洁的猪舍一排接着一排，每排隔成几十个小间，每间大猪圈七八条，小猪圈一二十条。有一间里就圈着这两头试验猪。这猪看到生人，有点害怕，躲往墙角，一双闪闪发光的小眼睛盯着我们。它俩皮毛色泽润滑，都三尺多高，长腿，微瘦。看上去每只足足三百多斤了，可是挪开栅栏往外放时，奔跑起来却像小猪一样轻快！
    发明的欲望
    6月20日，陶铸同志和检查团的人在澄海县银南社看改良“51”犁表演。同样的“51”犁，将犁镜的倾斜面调整一下，犁过的地便深了一寸。扶犁手，就是改装这犁的党员、农民、群众誉作发明家的林别人。
    林别人引着大家参观了农业社供他专门进行试验、发明的工厂，以及这个工厂发明、改良的二十二种别的农具。厂房有五六间房子那么大，稻草顶，十几个工人正在里边遵照林别人的设计制造打谷机的零件，有的在赶制改装的双轮双铧犁的木梁。厂房北边西边陈列着他们发明、改良成功的一千斤起重机，青饲料切碎机、打谷机、花生播种机、手推车等等农具，还有三十多部已经拆卸开的全铁制双轮双铧犁。当地干部介绍说，铁制双轮双铧犁一部重二百多斤，牛拉起来很吃力，林别人打算用木头尽量代替上边的零件，重量减轻到几十斤或百把斤，这项改装的工作已经开始了。
    村干部说，林别人这个同志搞发明创造的兴趣可大啦！前二年就发明了花生播种机，可惜没有得到社里的支持。社干部现在认识变了，花钱办了这么大的工厂，聘请林别人作工程师，专职领导发明创造。办起了工厂，林别人的钻劲更大了，更多更好的发明创造还在后边呢！林别人也笑着说：我想使我们社很快实现五化：肥料加工自动化；农产品加工机械化；运输车子化；农具改良化；电气化。这五化不简单，不过像现在这个样子干下去，也并不十分困难。
    艺术的兴趣
    7月1日，汽车从兴宁开到连平去，路过五华县城东乡，附近峻峭的高山坡上，开出了无数道整整齐齐的梯田。梯田上用白粉刷过的小石头嵌成一幅幅巨大的标语和打油诗。有一首写的是：“社会主义新事多，下放干部在山窝，锄头是笔山是纸，写出文章在山坡”。想想看，山是绿的，梯田土是红的，字是雪白的，诗又是那么地幽美和浪漫，这是多么美的一幅图画！一个多么引人神往的诗的境地！
    这里只是随便举个例子而已。像这样美丽动人的诗和画处处都可以看到。从人民的作业、生活上也能显著地表现出来。譬如为了保护水库大坝的坝面，需要种草在上面。本来也可以像野草那样地种上就算了，但是我看见许多水库在坝面上种草时，却费了心思，玩了许多花样，有方格子斜格子形的，有人字形的，有纽丝形的，有波纹式的，大大增加了坝面的美感！潮汕平原今年迁坟以后，那些从死人墓里挖出的烂棺木板，人民却把它劈成一细条一细条木杆，在网一般多的小河流小水渠上作成瓜架子，整整齐齐的，密密的，沿着河渠上空的两侧架开去。在长达几里，几十里的架子上面，爬满了各种各样瓜的绿叶，开着黄、白两色小花；架子下吊着一条条绿、黄色的黄瓜、丝瓜。看到这精致的瓜架，你绝不会想到这曾经是令人作呕的棺材板。
    如果留心观察，你还可以看到农民对穿着、住房的颜色、样式较过去讲究起来了。潮汕地区男青年多穿天蓝、黑色裤衩，上身穿圆口、短袖的线衬衣，腰缠一条颜色鲜艳的格子围巾。青少年妇女几乎百分之百穿着紧身花衣。干部和老年人关心农民居住条件的改善。在兴宁、河源、连平等地干部座谈会上，已能听到将来农民住房样式和颜色的争论。有的主张白墙、黑瓦、绿色大窗户，要雅致、朴素；有的主张白墙、黑瓦、红色大窗户。
    地位的变化
    我第一次在农村听到干部讨论这样一些崭新的问题：什么叫做自然科学？什么叫做世界权威？他们说：自然科学，无非是摸住生产规律，最大限度地发挥人的作用，生产出最多最好的东西。我创造了万斤亩，千斤猪，我就是科学家，就是世界权威。从这些言谈里，你还能找得出农民对科学的迷信思想和自卑感么？潮安县陈桥社试养千斤猪的青年妇女周巧香，对陶铸同志说了一句话：“现在什么都不怕，什么都有办法，只缺一门文化了。”这是代表今天农村青年一代呼喊出的声音。
