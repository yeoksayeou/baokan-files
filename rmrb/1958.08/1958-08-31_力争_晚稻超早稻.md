Strive to "Late Rice Surpassing Early Rice"

　　The south has already achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice. Many high-yield records exceeding 10,000 catties have emerged, and three provinces (Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hubei) have achieved yields exceeding 1,000 catties per mu. According to the earlier estimates of the agricultural department, the total output of early rice may reach more than 80 billion catties, an increase of more than 40 billion catties over last year. This is another victory in China's agricultural production this year, following the bumper harvest of wheat. Now that the bumper harvest of early rice has been achieved, what will the late rice harvest be like? Can the late rice yield make the same leap forward as early rice? This is a question of great concern to everyone. The broad masses of peasants in the south are now making great efforts to answer this question affirmatively. They have put forward a loud battle cry: "Late rice surpassing early rice!"

　　"Late rice surpassing early rice" is a slogan with revolutionary significance. We know that in the Yangtze River basin, the weather changes a lot during the growing season of late rice, and natural disasters are prone to occur. In addition, due to insufficient labor and fertilizer, people do not take the processing and management of late rice as seriously and meticulously as they do with early rice. Therefore, the yield of late rice is usually not as high as that of early rice, and it is also unstable. Some farmers even think that "early rice is a treasure, late rice is grass," holding a negative attitude of "harvest if there is, discard if there isn't." However, this year, provinces such as Jiangxi, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Sichuan dare to put forward the slogan of "late rice surpassing early rice" in the context of the bumper harvest of early rice, and have already made great efforts in sowing, transplanting, and field management. This shows that the broad masses of peasants and cadres are determined to break with conventions and take their own path.

　　A few people in the countryside, represented by the well-to-do middle peasants, are accustomed to looking at problems with the old almanac. They believe that it is impossible for late rice to exceed early rice, so they always oppose putting more effort and investment into late rice. But they are wrong. They have not seen that many circumstances related to late rice production have changed: due to the great development of water conservancy construction, most areas have largely eliminated floods and droughts; relying on the support of the state and the strength of agricultural cooperatives, it is also possible to eliminate rice pests and diseases; large-scale fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaigns can supply the large amount of fertilizer needed for late rice; and the realization of ball-bearingization of transportation tools and collectivization of household labor in the short term can also greatly alleviate the difficulty of insufficient labor. These are all new circumstances that are very conducive to the increased production of late rice. Subjectively speaking, people have learned many valuable new experiences from this year's bumper harvests of wheat and early rice. For example, highly dense planting has generally been promoted in early rice production in various places, greatly increasing the number of plants and ears per unit area; methods to prevent lodging after highly dense planting have been carefully studied and adopted; and the work of drainage and irrigation and fertilization has been improved in accordance with the requirements of highly dense planting, etc. In short, from many favorable conditions, it is entirely possible for the provinces in the Yangtze River basin to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice and realize "late rice surpassing early rice." As for areas where the yield of late rice was relatively stable in the first place, of course, it is even more possible to surpass it.

　　What is most noteworthy is that at present, some people have ideas that neglect field management. After the bumper harvest of early rice, some people saw that the late rice was growing very well and thought that a bumper harvest could be achieved without continuing efforts, so they relaxed; others thought that after the implementation of highly dense planting, weeding, topdressing, pest control, and lodging prevention could not be carried out, so they also relaxed the processing and management of late rice. It is necessary to organize the masses to debate these issues in conjunction with the current production activities, and take action while debating these phenomena. In the process of field management of late rice, the Weixing Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, issued the fallacy that "this year's late rice is densely planted, weeds cannot be removed, fertilizer cannot be applied, pests cannot be controlled, and lodging cannot be prevented," headed by several well-to-do middle peasants. This cooperative launched a great debate on the issue of "whether field management of late rice can be strengthened." The masses studied many field management measures suitable for dense planting: for example, after dense planting, it is difficult for people to enter the field to topdress, and after research by the masses, "water green fertilizer" was manufactured, allowing the fertilizer slurry to flow into the field by itself. Methods such as setting up springboards and placing bucket racks were also used to carry fertilizer into the fields without damaging a single seedling. In this way, the fallacy that "topdressing is impossible after dense planting" was shattered, and the entire cooperative's field management became a vigorous affair.

　　To strive for a bumper harvest of late rice, we must firmly grasp two major keys at present: one is to overcome various natural disasters, and the other is to eliminate three types of fields and three types of seedlings. At present, rice pests and diseases are quite common, and severe droughts have occurred in a few areas. The slightest carelessness regarding these natural disasters will cause losses to late rice production. Wherever disasters occur, strong disaster relief teams should be organized immediately to do everything possible to extinguish the disasters and protect the crops. Since the beginning of June, Xingzi County, Jiangxi Province, has not had a thorough rain for more than two months. The entire county's rural men, women, old and young were mobilized together to transport lake water, dig mountain springs, and divert water for irrigation day and night, ensuring that more than 42,000 mu of double-season late rice were spared from severe drought. At the same time, all 6,500 mu of late rice seedlings still threatened by drought were transplanted to fields with water sources, and finally all double-season late rice were freed from the danger of drought. While concentrating on accumulating fertilizer, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, universally launched the "thousands of lights and ten thousand fires" campaign to completely eliminate rice borers.

　　Seizing the time to eliminate the three types of seedlings is the central requirement of current field management. Now the leading organs in various places have organized tens of thousands of cadres to go to the fields to strengthen field management together with the peasants. But there are still some areas where the work is not tight enough. What urgently needs to be done now is: to conduct field inspections universally, find three types of seedlings and three types of fields, and immediately organize forces to carry out a concentrated remedy. The Nanxiong County Committee of Guangdong Province discovered that yellowing rice seedlings accounted for 40% to 50% of the late rice planting area, and immediately convened a radio conference to criticize the complacency of some cadres, put forward the slogan of making the three types of seedlings "eliminate in one day, change in three days, and catch up with the first-class seedlings in five days," and mobilized more than 120,000 people in the county to march towards the three types of seedlings, while topdressing with fast-acting fertilizer and eliminating pests. As a result, the three types of seedlings turned green again.

　　Some new issues in field management are worth noting. For example, highly dense planting has been universally promoted in various provinces, and it is necessary to develop a set of new measures adapted to dense planting. This is not only directly related to striving for a bumper harvest of late rice this year, but also of great significance to the reform of rice production technology in the future.

　　The national late rice planting area is more than 160 million mu (about the same as early rice). Striving for a bumper harvest of late rice is an important part of the great struggle to strive for a high-speed increase in grain production throughout the year. Therefore, all localities must resolutely oppose any laxity and persevere in field management to the end, and strive for a complete victory!

### 力争“晚稻超早稻”

　　力争“晚稻超早稻”
    南方的早稻已经获得了空前的大丰收，万斤以上的高额丰产纪录涌现了好多，亩产超过千斤的省份也出现了三个（安徽、江苏和湖北）。根据前些时农业部门的预计，早稻总产量可达八百亿斤以上，比去年增加四百多亿斤。这是今年我国农业生产上继小麦大丰收之后的又一次胜利。早稻的大丰收到手了，晚稻的收成将会怎样呢？晚稻产量能不能像早稻那样跃进呢？这是大家很关心的问题。现在南方各地的广大农民正在用巨大的努力对这个问题作出肯定的答复。他们提出了响亮的战斗口号：“晚稻超早稻！”
    “晚稻超早稻”，这是一个具有革命意义的口号。我们知道，在长江流域，在晚稻生长期间，天气变化很多，容易发生自然灾害。再加劳力和肥料不足，人们对晚稻的加工管理不像对早稻那样认真细致，因此晚稻产量通常不如早稻高，而且也不稳定。有的农民甚至认为“早稻是宝，晚稻是草”，抱着“有就收，没就丢”的消极态度。但是今年江西、湖北、浙江、安徽、四川等省都敢于在早稻大丰收的情况下，提出“晚稻超早稻”的口号，并且已经在播种、插秧和田间管理各方面都作了很大的努力。这表现出广大农民和干部坚决要打破常规，走自己的路。
    农村中以富裕中农为代表的少数人习惯于用老皇历看问题，他们认为晚稻根本不可能超过早稻，所以总是反对对晚稻更多地花工夫，下本钱。但是，他们错了。他们没有看见与晚稻生产有关的许多情况已经发生了变化：由于水利建设的大发展，绝大部分地区已经在相当大的程度上消除了水旱灾害；依靠国家的支援和农业社的力量，也有可能消灭水稻病虫害；大规模的积肥造肥运动，可以供应晚稻所需要的大量肥料；短期内实现运转工具滚珠轴承化和家务劳动的集体化，也可以使劳力不足的困难大大减轻。这些都是大大有利于晚稻增产的新情况。就主观方面来说，人们从今年的小麦和早稻大丰收中吸取了许多宝贵的新经验。如各地在早稻生产上一般都推行了高度密植，使单位面积上的株数、穗数大大增加；认真研究和采取了高度密植后防止倒伏的办法；按照高度密植的要求改善了排灌和施肥的工作，等等。总之，从多方面的有利条件看，长江流域各省争取晚稻大丰收和实现“晚稻超早稻”是完全可能的。至于原来晚稻产量就比较稳定的地区，当然就更有可能超过了。
    最值得注意的，是目前在一部分人中间有忽视田间管理的思想。有些人在早稻大丰收之后看到晚稻生长很好，就认为不要继续努力也可以实现大丰收，因而松了气；有些人则认为实行高度密植以后，除草、追肥、治虫、防倒伏等工作都无法进行了，因而也放松了对晚稻的加工管理。必须结合当前的生产活动，组织群众来辩论这些问题，针对这些现象，一面辩论，一面行动。福建省海澄县卫星农业社在进行晚稻田间管理过程中，以几个富裕中农为首的怀疑派发出了“今年晚稻密植，草无法除，肥无法施，虫无法治，倒伏无法防”的谬论。这个合作社就“能否加强晚稻田间管理”的问题展开了大辩论，群众研究出许多适应密植的田间管理措施：如密植后人很难进田追肥，经过群众研究，就制造出“水绿肥”，使肥浆自流进田。还采用搭跳板、放桶架等办法挑肥下田，一棵秧苗也没有压坏。这样，那种“密植以后无法追肥”的谬论被粉碎了，全社田间管理闹得轰轰烈烈。
    争取晚稻大丰收，目前必须狠狠抓住两大关键：一个是战胜各种自然灾害，一个是消灭三类田和三类苗。目前水稻病虫害相当普遍，少数地区发生了严重的干旱。对于这些自然灾害稍有麻痹大意，都会使晚稻生产遭受损失。凡是发生灾害的地方，都应当立即组织强大的抗灾队伍，尽一切努力扑灭灾害，保护庄稼。江西省星子县从6月初以后，有两个多月没下透雨。全县农村男女老少一齐出动，夜以继日地车湖水，挖山泉，引水灌溉，保证了四万二千多亩双季晚稻免受严重旱灾，同时又把仍受旱灾威胁的六千五百亩晚稻秧苗全部移栽到有水源的田里去，终于使全部双季晚稻摆脱了旱灾的危害。浙江省新登县在突击积肥的同时，普遍展开了“千灯万火”运动，全面歼灭螟蛾。
    抓紧时间消灭三类苗，是当前田间管理上的中心要求。现在各地领导机关已经组织了成千上万的干部下到田间，同农民一起加强田间管理。但也还有一些地区抓得不紧。现在急需要做的事情是：普遍进行田间检查，发现三类苗和三类田，立即组织力量突击补救。广东省南雄县委发现发黄的禾苗占晚稻种植面积的百分之四、五十，立即召开广播大会，批判某些干部的麻痹思想，提出使三类苗“一天消灭，三天改观，五天赶上一类禾”的口号，发动全县十二万多人向三类苗进军，一面追施速效肥料，一面扑灭害虫。结果，三类苗就回青转绿了。
    在田间管理上有些新问题值得注意。例如各省普遍推行了高度密植，必需研究出一套适应密植的新措施。这不但是与争取今年晚稻大丰收直接有关，而且对今后水稻生产技术的改革也有重要意义。
    全国晚稻种植面积有一亿六千多万亩（同早稻差不多），争取晚稻大丰收，是争取全年粮食高速度增产的伟大斗争的重要部分。因此各地必须坚决反对任何松懈情绪，把田间管理坚持到底，力争全胜！
