Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Beijing and Jilin Promote Hydraulic Mining
　　The world's newest coal mining technology - hydraulic mining - has begun to be implemented in coal mines in Beijing. On the 13th, the hydraulic mining equipment newly installed in the 208 working face of the Chengzi Coal Mine of the Jingsi Mining Bureau has been continuously sending raw coal out of the mine.
　　Currently, the Jingsi Mining Bureau is installing hydraulic mining equipment in several coal mines simultaneously. The newly built Jiulongshan hydraulic coal mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons started construction on August 1st.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 14th: The Jilin Province Coal Industry Department has recently begun to promote the new technology of hydraulic mining in eight coal mining working faces and roadway excavation sites. The coal mining team led by Zong Xiyun, a famous advanced producer of the Jiaohe Mine, achieved good results in the first hydraulic mining experiment on the 10th. The Zong Xiyun coal mining team used a self-made water gun and connected two low-pressure pumps in series to replace the high-pressure pump, mining 20 tons of coal in 12 minutes. A tunneling site in the Zazi Mine of the Tonghua Mining Bureau advanced one meter in two minutes by trial use of hydraulic excavation.

With the vigorous promotion of the new technology of hydraulic mining, a lot of mechanical equipment will inevitably be needed. Jilin Province plans to transform the existing coal mine repair and assembly plant into a manufacturing plant, and use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to trial-produce and produce water pumps, water guns, and other tools and equipment; currently, the hydraulic mining tools and equipment used in various mines are all trial-produced by employees using old materials through crash programs.

At present, the coal mines in Jilin Province have formulated plans, requiring four mines, nineteen working faces, and seventeen excavation sites to implement hydraulic mining and hydraulic excavation in the second half of this year. In addition, fifteen new hydraulic coal mines will be built.

### 北京吉林推行水力采煤

　　北京吉林推行水力采煤
　　新华社14日讯　世界最新的采煤技术——水力采煤，已经开始在北京的煤矿推行。13日，京西矿务局城子煤矿在二零八工作面新安装起来的水力采煤设备，已经把原煤源源送出矿井。
    现在，京西矿务局正在几个煤矿上同时安装水力采煤设备。新建的年产九十万吨的九龙山水力采煤矿井，已经在8月1日开工兴建。
    新华社长春14日电　吉林省煤炭工业部门最近在八个采煤工作面和巷道掘进场子上，开始推行水力采煤的新技术。蛟河矿著名先进生产者宗希云领导的采煤队，在10日初次试验水力采煤就得到良好效果。宗希云采煤队使用自制的水枪，用两台低压泵串联代替高压泵，在十二分钟内采了二十吨煤。通化矿务局砟子矿一个掘进场子试用水力掘进，两分钟就前进了一公尺。
    随着水力采煤新技术的大力推行，势必需要很多的机械设备，吉林省准备变现有煤矿修配厂为制造厂，用土洋结合的办法试制和生产水泵、水枪等工具设备；目前各矿使用的水力采煤工具和设备，都是职工们用旧料突击试制的。
    现在吉林省各煤矿已订出规划，要求今年下半年有四个矿井、十九个工作面、十七个掘进场子，实行水力采煤和水力掘进。此外，还要新建十五个水力采煤矿井。
