　  河南农民冒风雨除草积肥
    据新华社讯　安徽省各地正积极防治病虫害，力争秋季大丰收。据不完全的统计，全省共有五百四十多万亩田发生病虫害，现已防治的有五百二十多万亩。
    安徽各地在虫害发生后，都及时进行了防治。芜湖专区在发生病虫害的二百二十五万多亩田里，已全部进行了防治。蚌埠专区最近每天有七十万二千多人参加灭虫。
    据新华社讯　获得夏季大丰收的河南省人民，现在每天出动一千九百四十五万多人顶着烈日，冒着风雨，日日夜夜在青沙帐里突击开展以除草积肥为中心的秋田管理运动。从7月22日以来，经过大干苦干二十天，各种作物普遍生长良好。一类苗由原来的五、六千万亩增加到八千多万亩，三类苗由11.6％减少到7.7％，丰产“元帅”县和“卫星”群已经露出锋芒。秋季的丰收将大大超过麦季。
