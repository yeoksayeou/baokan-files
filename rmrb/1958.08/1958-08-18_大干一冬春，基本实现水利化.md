Engage in a Big Winter and Spring Campaign to Basically Achieve Water Conservancy

Since the upsurge in agricultural production began last winter, the Chinese people have first created a great miracle in water conservancy construction, surpassing thousands of years in just one year. After a winter and spring of hard work, the national irrigated area has increased from 520 million mu to 970 million mu, with the newly added area almost equal to twice the original irrigated area before liberation.

The huge role of water conservancy construction in this year's great leap in agricultural production is very obvious. As everyone knows, this year has not been a year of favorable weather. Both the north and the south have been attacked by varying degrees of disasters. First, the north experienced a drought that has been rare for many years. From October last year to February this year, rainfall in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, and central and western Inner Mongolia was 30% to 60% less than the rainfall in the same period in previous years. The wheat in these areas was mostly sown with drought resistance, and the base moisture was insufficient. By June of this year, the drought situation had further expanded, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin, the Huai River Basin, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, and parts of Northeast China were all severely threatened by drought. Guangdong and the eight provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were also hit by heavy rains in April and May this year. However, thanks to the great power of a large number of water conservancy projects, coupled with other measures, we overcame the severe drought and prevented floods, creating the great miracle of a sharp increase of more than 80 billion jin of grain. Many historically low-yielding areas have become high-yielding areas. These facts prove that water conservancy construction is causing tremendous changes in the natural and productive landscapes of many areas, and the era of man becoming the master of nature has begun.

Now that our water conservancy construction has achieved such great success, what should we do in the future? Should we continue to work hard on the basis of the existing great achievements, or should we just work a little bit? The correct answer should be: In order to ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production in the future, we should continue to work hard. Starting from the fourth quarter, we will work hard for another winter and spring, and strive to basically achieve water conservancy in the vast majority of areas across the country. This is our task.

The fact that the Chinese people can create such a magnificent miracle in water conservancy construction in such a short period of time is something to be proud of. But if we become complacent because of this, thinking that the water conservancy projects have been built almost to the top, and we can take a break, then that would be wrong. Taking the north as an example, more than half of the cultivated land has not yet been irrigated; three-quarters of the areas with serious soil erosion have not yet been treated; and the standards of the completed projects are generally low, and they are not completely reliable in the event of major floods and droughts. In that case, how can we say that it is already "almost" or "topped out"? As for the South, where natural conditions are superior, the foundation of water conservancy is good, and the proportion of irrigated area in the total cultivated area is generally relatively large, we cannot say that either. Although the water conservancy conditions in the South are good, the achievements in water conservancy construction are generally not as great as those in the North, except for a few provinces. Therefore, we cannot be complacent and self-satisfied. It should be seen that floods and droughts in the South have not been eliminated, and drought in particular threatens agricultural production in many areas almost every year. Moreover, our goal of building water conservancy is by no means limited to eliminating general floods and droughts! Our purpose in building farmland water conservancy should be to eliminate floods and droughts and accelerate the speed of agricultural development, and to further achieve comprehensive utilization of water resources in irrigation, power generation, navigation, and aquaculture. If we use such standards to measure the achievements we have already made, then it is not almost, but still far from enough. We should all, regardless of north or south, take advantage of the victory and continue to advance and work hard, first to initially achieve water conservancy, and then to completely achieve water conservancy.

In the struggle to achieve water conservancy, we must also criticize the僥倖心理 of some people. They believe that the existing projects can already reduce floods and droughts to some extent, and that extraordinarily large floods and droughts only occur once every few years; building more projects is a bit uneconomical! This is essentially an idea of ​​satisfying the status quo and muddling along, a thought of relying on the heavens for food. We can ask in return: What if we encounter extraordinarily large floods or droughts? In the first half of this year, Hebei Province experienced the worst drought in 30 years. General earthen wells and brick wells were all dry, and only machine wells and large wells with a depth of three to five zhang could supply water for irrigation. Those counties that were unwilling to work hard to dig machine wells and large wells suffered losses in production; while Anguo County, which paid attention to digging machine wells and large wells from the beginning, was able to supply water whenever the fields needed it, and finally ensured an average wheat yield of 490 jin per mu. May I ask whether Anguo County, which spent a lot of effort to dig machine wells and large wells, was "cost-effective", or those places that were unwilling to spend a lot of effort to dig machine wells and large wells? Since we want to be the masters of nature, we should not have any luck mentality in the struggle with nature. Originally, our ultimate goal of achieving water conservancy is not only to eliminate ordinary floods and droughts, but also to eliminate those so-called major floods and droughts that occur once every few years in appropriate steps. In order to achieve this goal, we must continue to exert our energy and work hard.

So, is it possible to basically achieve water conservancy by working hard for a winter and a spring? It is entirely possible. The key lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and giving full play to the strength and wisdom of the masses. Last winter and this spring, the broad masses in various regions have already created very rich experiences in water conservancy construction. Farmers in Gansu Province have built hundreds of miles of water diversion canals that cross mountains and valleys; farmers in mountainous and hilly areas of Hunan and Hubei have built a complete water conservancy system of "long vines bearing melons" with rivers and reservoirs connected and canals and ponds connected; farmers in Xushui County, Hebei Province, have built "grape bunch" reservoirs and "starry sky" reservoirs in the plains; Huaihe River farmers in Anhui have created valuable experience in river network development... All these creations prove that as long as the working people liberate their minds and exert their soaring energy, water conservancy can be achieved in a short period of time, whether in mountainous areas, hilly areas, plains, low-lying areas, or sandy wasteland areas. It is particularly worth noting here the achievements and experience of Huaihe River farmers in building river networks. In the plains and low-lying areas, artificial river channels of different depths and widths are dug according to the terrain, and springs are placed in each river channel. The river channels are connected to various reservoirs, pits, and ponds to form a complete river network. This can completely prevent floods, completely eliminate droughts, and also develop navigation. The Northern Farmland Water Conservancy Work Conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture in July believed that the plains and low-lying areas of Huaihe River, northern Jiangsu, and Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast China can gradually realize river network development.

In order to further develop water conservancy construction and accelerate the realization of water conservancy, we must continue to implement the "three main" policies of focusing on water storage, small-scale projects, and community-run projects. Taking small-scale projects as the foundation, medium-sized projects as the backbone, and supplemented by necessary large-scale projects, the combination of large, medium, and small projects can carry out water conservancy construction in a faster, better, and more economical way. This is the correct line for leading hundreds of millions of people to carry out water conservancy construction. Resolutely implementing this line can not only develop farmland water conservancy, but also fundamentally control and comprehensively utilize small and medium-sized rivers. The crux of the matter is still whether to believe in and rely on the masses. Some people believe that farmers can only build some small-scale projects. After the efforts of last winter and this spring, "the easy-to-build projects have been completed, and the projects will be difficult in the future, and they cannot be built more." This is a metaphysical way of thinking and does not look at problems from a developmental perspective. When the masses begin to build water conservancy projects, they can generally only build some small-scale projects. Under such circumstances, pursuing medium-sized or large-scale projects too much will inevitably deviate from reality and the masses. This winter and next spring, the construction of water conservancy projects should still focus on small-scale projects. However, the masses are not always able to build only small-scale projects. The law of the development of things is always from small to large, from low-level to high-level, and from popularization to improvement. In previous years, even reservoirs with a dam height of more than ten meters had to be included in the scope of national capital construction. In this year's water conservancy construction, through the methods of civil-run and public assistance and collaboration, some irrigation canals hundreds of miles long and reservoirs with dam heights of dozens of meters were quickly built mainly by the strength of cooperatives. In future water conservancy construction, under the principle of basing on small-scale projects, the number of medium-sized and even large-scale projects run by cooperatives or jointly run will relatively increase. This is predictable. Of course, those large-scale projects that are technically very complex, controlling, and pivotal still need to be run by the power of the state in the future.

The scale of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring will be much larger than that of last winter and this spring. According to statistics from October last year to the end of July this year, the total amount of earth and stone work completed nationwide was 56 billion cubic meters. In the next year, the planned amount of earth and stone work to be completed in the northern region alone is more than 86 billion cubic meters. The southern region also plans to complete 30 billion cubic meters. Is it difficult to complete such a large task? There are difficulties. The large amount of engineering and the lack of labor are a major difficulty. Under the current circumstances, the most effective and main way to overcome this difficulty is to vigorously innovate technology, promote advanced tools, achieve roller bearing, and eliminate human carrying. In the five months of autumn and winter last year, Henan Province only completed 3.2 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. At the beginning of March, a conference was held to promote advanced water conservancy tools. After more than 5 million pieces of advanced tools were promoted by the end of May, the work efficiency increased by one to dozens of times. From March to May, although some of the labor force was transferred to spring plowing, more than 5 billion cubic meters were completed, greatly exceeding the number of the previous five months. It can be seen how important the promotion of advanced tools is to accelerating water conservancy construction.

Another major difficulty in large-scale water conservancy construction is the shortage of building materials. We cannot sit and wait for steel and cement, we must rely on the masses and try our best to obtain materials locally and manufacture them locally. Guangxi Province plans to build 6,367 large and small cement plants (kilns) this year. By July 25, 1,084 had been put into production, and more than 99,400 tons of cement had been manufactured. Every region should explore its own potential and expand the production and supply of water conservancy construction materials.

In the water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, the spirit of communist collaboration developed rapidly, and people broke the boundaries of counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives to support and cooperate with each other. In the water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, collaboration between mountainous and plain areas, between adjacent areas, and between agricultural cooperatives should be organized more extensively, so that various regions and agricultural cooperatives can help each other in terms of labor, materials, and technology, and closely cooperate in river management. This is one of the important conditions for accelerating the realization of water conservancy.

For the water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, all provinces and regions have relatively sufficient ideological and work preparations. For example, Yunnan Province began to plan for the next year's water conservancy construction in April this year, planning and arranging projects at the same time, and gradually carrying out construction. Jilin Province has decided to use the current period of short breaks to carry out a production campaign centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, and requires that more than 60% of the plan to expand the irrigation area in 1959 be completed during this period. Guangxi and other provinces and regions are implementing the policy of "small repairs during small busy periods, large repairs during large busy periods, and full repairs when not busy" for year-round water conservancy repairs. From June to July this year, the Central Ministry of Agriculture held on-site meetings on farmland water conservancy work in the South and the North respectively, summarized the experience of water conservancy construction, and discussed and drafted the tasks for the next year. These all show that the Party's leadership over water conservancy construction is becoming more and more proactive. Now there are less than two months before the fourth quarter, and the next year's water conservancy construction will begin. All regions should, in the spirit of grasping the next year this year and grasping the next season this season, seize the time to formulate plans, train cadres, raise funds, and build materials, and make all preparations for the water conservancy construction this winter. In order to ensure the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, we must work hard for another winter and a spring and win a new and great victory in water conservancy construction!

　　大干一冬春，基本实现水利化
    自从去年冬季兴起农业生产高潮以后，我国人民首先在水利建设上创造了一年胜过几千年的伟大奇迹。经过一冬一春的苦战，全国农田灌溉面积由五亿二千万亩增加到九亿七千万亩，新增加的数字差不多等于解放前原有灌溉面积的两倍。
      在今年的农业生产大跃进中，水利建设所起的巨大作用是十分明显的。谁都知道，今年并不是个风调雨顺之年，不论北方或南方，都有不少地区受到不同程度的灾害的袭击。首先是北方发生了许多年来少见的大旱。河北、山西、山东、陕西、甘肃、内蒙古中部和西部，去年10月到今年2月的降雨量少于历年同期降雨量的30％—60％。这些地区的小麦多是抗旱播种的，底墒不足。到今年6月间，旱情更加扩大，黄河流域中下游、淮河流域、长江流域中下游和东北一部分地区，都受到干旱的严重威胁。广东和长江中下游八省在今年4、5月也曾受到暴雨的袭击。但是，由于大量的水利工程发挥了巨大的威力，再加上其他措施，我们就战胜了酷旱，也防止了洪涝灾害，创造了猛增粮食八百多亿斤的大奇迹。许多历史上的低产区都变成高产区了。这些事实证明：水利建设正在使许多地区的自然面貌和生产面貌发生巨大的变化，人作自然的主宰的时代已经开始了。
    我们的水利建设既然已经获得了这样巨大的成就，今后还应该干什么呢？是在已有的巨大成就的基础上继续大干呢，还是只要小干一下就行了呢？正确的回答应该是：为了保证今后农业生产的更大跃进，应该继续大干下去。从第四季度起，再大干一冬一春，争取全国绝大多数地区基本实现水利化。这就是我们的任务。
    我国人民在短短的时间内能创造出这样宏伟的水利建设奇迹是足以自豪的。但如果由此而产生自满情绪，认为水利工程修得已经差不多了，到顶了，可以歇一口气了，那就不对。以北方而论，一半以上的耕地还没有得到灌溉；四分之三的水土流失严重的地区还没有得到治理；已修的工程，标准一般偏低，遇到大的水旱灾害，还不完全保险。既然如此，怎么能说已经“差不多”或者“到顶”了呢？至于自然条件优越，水利事业基础好，灌溉面积在总耕地面积中所占比重一般比较大的南方也不能这样说。南方的水利条件虽好，但是除了少数几个省外，水利建设的成绩一般不如北方大。所以也不能自满自足。应当看到，南方地区的水旱灾害并没有消灭，特别是干旱，差不多年年都威胁许多地区的农业生产。何况我们兴修水利的目标绝不是仅仅限于消灭一般的旱涝灾害呢！我们建设农田水利的目的应该是消灭旱涝灾害和加快农业的发展速度，进一步作到在灌溉、发电、航运、水产等方面综合利用水利资源。如果用这样的标准衡量我们已经取得的成就，那就不是差不多，而还是差得远哩。我们应该不分南北，大家都乘胜前进，继续大干，首先初步实现水利化，进而彻底实现水利化。
    在实现水利化的斗争中，还要批判某些人的侥幸心理。他们认为现有的工程已经能在某种程度上减免水旱灾害了，而特大的水旱灾害多少年才能碰上一次；建设更多的工程，有点不合算！这实质上是一种满足现状、得过且过的思想，是一种靠天吃饭的思想。可以反问一句：倘若遇到特大的洪水或特大的干旱怎么办呢？今年上半年河北省发生了三十年来所没有的大旱。一般的土井、砖井都干涸了，只有机井和三、五丈深的大井可以供水灌溉。那些不肯下工夫打机井、大井的县在生产上都吃了亏；而一开始就注意打机井、大井的安国县却能做到田里什么时候要水什么时候给水，终于保证了小麦平均亩产四百九十斤。试问到底是花了大力气去打机井、大井的安国县“合算”呢，还是那些不肯花大力气去打机井、大井的地方“合算”呢？我们既然要做自然的主人，在同自然做斗争中就不该存有任何侥幸心理。本来我们实现水利化的最终目的，不仅要消灭普通的水旱灾害，而且要按照适当的步骤消灭那种所谓多少年一遇的重大的水旱灾害。为了实现这个目标，就必须继续鼓足干劲，大干苦干。
    那么，大干一冬一春，基本上实现水利化，究竟能不能办到呢？完全能够办到。关键在于加强党的领导，政治挂帅，充分发挥群众的力量和智慧。去冬今春，各个地区广大群众已经在水利建设上创造了很丰富的经验。甘肃省农民建成了几百里长的、翻山跨谷的引水渠道；湖南、湖北山区和丘陵区的农民建成了河库相通、渠塘相连的“长藤结瓜式”的完整水利系统；河北徐水县农民在平原地区修起了“葡萄串”水库和“满天星”水库；安徽淮北地区创造了河网化的宝贵经验……。所有这些创造证明：只要劳动人民解放了思想，鼓足了冲天干劲，不论山区、丘陵区、平原、低洼地区或沙荒地区，都可以在不长的时间内实现水利化。这里特别值得注意的是淮北农民建设河网化的成就和经验。在平原和低洼地区根据地形挖出不同深度和宽度的人工河道，在每条河道里都下泉，河道跟各种水库、坑、塘连结起来，形成一个完整的河网。这样既可彻底防御涝灾，又可彻底消除干旱，还可发展航运。农业部7月间召开的北方农田水利工作会议认为，淮北、苏北以及河北、河南、山东、山西、内蒙古、东北等地的平原、低洼地区，都可以逐步实现河网化。
    为了进一步发展水利建设，加快实现水利化，必须继续贯彻蓄水为主，小型为主，社办为主的“三主”方针，以小型为基础，中型为骨干，辅以必要的大型，大中小互相结合，才能多快好省地进行水利建设，这是领导亿万人民进行水利建设的正确路线。坚决贯彻这条路线，不但能够发展农田水利，也能够根治和综合利用中小河流。问题的中心仍然在于是不是相信群众和依靠群众。有人认为，农民只能修筑一些小型工程，经过去冬今春的努力，“好修的工程修完了，以后工程艰巨了，不能多修了”。这是一种形而上学的思想方法，没有用发展的观点看问题。群众在开始兴修水利工程的时候，一般只能兴修一些小型的工程，在那样的情况下，过多地追求中型或大型的工程，必然脱离实际，脱离群众。今冬明春兴修水利工程，仍然应该以小型为主。但是群众并不是永远只能修小型的。事物发展的规律，总是由小到大，由低级到高级，由普及到提高。在前些年，连坝高十几公尺的水库，都得列入国家基本建设范围之内。在今年的水利建设中，采取民办公助和协作的方法，一些几百里的灌溉长渠、坝高几十公尺的水库，竟主要靠合作社的力量很快建成了。在今后的水利建设中，在以小型为基础的原则下，合作社自办或联合举办的中型工程甚至大型工程将会相对地增加。这是可以预料的。当然，那种技术十分复杂、具有控制性、枢纽性的大型工程，今后也还需要用国家的力量来举办。
    今冬明春的水利建设规模将比去冬今春更大得多。据从去年10月到今年7月底的统计，全国完成土石方总量五百六十亿公方。在下一个年度中，仅北方地区计划完成的土石方量就有八百六十多亿公方。南方地区也计划完成三百亿公方。要完成这么大的任务有没有困难呢？有困难。工程量大而劳动力不足，就是一个大困难。在目前情况下，克服这个困难的最有效、最主要的办法，是大力革新技术，推广先进工具，实现滚珠轴承化，消灭人挑人抬。河南省去年秋冬五个月中只完成了土石方三十二亿公方的工程量，3月初召开了水利先进工具推广会议，5月底推广了五百多万件先进工具之后，工效提高一倍到几十倍，从3月到5月，虽有部分劳动力转入春耕，但却完成了五十多亿公方，大大超过了前五个月的数字。可见推广先进工具对于加速水利建设具有多么重大的意义。
    大规模水利建设中的另一个主要困难，是建筑材料不足。我们不能坐等钢筋水泥，必须依靠群众，尽量就地取材，就地制造。广西省要在今年兴建大小水泥厂（窑）六千三百六十七个，到7月25日，已有一千零八十四个投入生产，已制造出水泥九万九千四百多吨。每个地区都应当发掘自己的潜力，扩大水利施工材料的生产和供应。
    去冬今春的水利建设中，共产主义协作精神迅速发展了起来，人们打破了县、乡和农业社的界限，互相支援和合作。在今冬明春的水利建设中，应当更广泛地组织山区平原之间、毗邻地区之间、农业社之间的协作，使各个地区和农业社在劳动力、物资、技术等方面互相帮助，在治理河流方面密切配合。这是加速实现水利化的重要条件之一。
    对于今冬明春的水利建设，各省区都有比较充分的思想准备和工作准备。如云南省从今年4月就开始进行下一年度的水利建设规划，一面规划，一面进行工程排队，逐步施工。吉林省已经决定利用目前开始的挂锄期间开展以水利建设和积肥为中心的生产运动，要求在这个期间完成1959年扩大灌溉面积计划的60％以上。广西等省区实行“小忙小修、大忙大修、不忙全修”的常年修水利的方针。中央农业部从今年6月到7月分别召开了南方和北方农田水利工作现场会议，总结了水利建设的经验，并讨论和拟出了下一年度的任务。这些都说明党对水利建设工作的领导是越来越主动了。现在离第四季度还不到两个月，下一个年度的水利建设将开始。各个地区应当本着今年抓明年、上季抓下季的精神，抓紧制订规划、训练干部、筹措资金和建设物资，为今冬的水利建设做好一切准备。为了保证1959年的农业生产大跃进，我们一定要再苦干一冬一春，在水利建设上打一个新的大胜仗！
