Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th -- The Chang'an Branch of the Xinhua Bookstore in Shaanxi Province, during the technical and cultural revolutions in the countryside, has been expanding book distribution by facing the agricultural cooperatives and relying on the masses. From late June to the end of July, it distributed a total of more than 860,000 copies of various popular reading materials and agricultural science and technology books in the county's rural areas, which is equivalent to eight times the total number of various books distributed in the first half of this year.

Since the beginning of this year, the county has established a large number of factories within a few months, popularized primary school education, basically eliminated illiteracy among young people by the end of June, and established clubs and libraries in more than 500 agricultural cooperatives. Red and expert schools and technical evening schools have been set up everywhere, and mass poetry creation has also sprung up like mushrooms after a rain.

Under this situation, the Party branch of the bookstore, while organizing employees to study the Party's general line for socialist construction, guided the employees to discuss how the nationwide and local Great Leap Forward situations and book distribution work should face production and face the countryside. Through work inspection, it criticized the right-leaning conservative ideas that did not pay attention to rural distribution work in the past. The employees formulated a leap forward plan for rural book distribution and went to the countryside to distribute books.

In carrying out rural book distribution work, this bookstore closely relied on the masses, first understanding the needs of the masses and then satisfying them. They went to agricultural cooperatives and fields in groups to understand the learning situation and number of people, and introduced the content of books suitable for their needs to the farmers. When the Fengguang Cooperative lacked experience in late-stage cotton management, they recommended and introduced books on this experience, and the members bought hundreds of copies at once. They also learned about the situation while helping farmers with their labor, and supplied books according to different situations.

The supply of a large number of books to the countryside has also promoted the technical and cultural revolutions, and the farmers are very welcome. Huang Zhinan, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Jiulian No. 2 Cooperative, after buying a book introducing Wang Baojing's high-yield corn, immediately organized more than ten young people to study Wang Baojing's corn high-yield experience, and immediately supplemented seedlings and applied top dressing to dozens of acres of cornfields according to these experiences. The book introducing Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton high-yield experience was distributed to more than 10,000 copies in cotton-growing areas. Many members followed these experiences and called the book a "living teacher." Many members said, "We have just taken off our illiterate hats, and the bookstore has sent books, which is really like sending charcoal in the snow."

Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Bureau held a rural culture on-site meeting in Chang'an County, and decided to promote the county's experience throughout the province.

　　把文化食粮送到农村
　　长安县新华书店图书发行工作大跃进
    据新华社西安14日电　新华书店陕西省长安支店在农村技术革命和文化革命中面向农业社，依靠群众扩大图书发行工作，从6月下旬到7月底在全县农村一共发行了各种通俗读物和农业科学技术等书籍八十六万多册，等于今年上半年各种书籍发行总数的八倍。
    今年以来，这个县几个月中就办了大量工厂，普及了小学教育，到6月底全县基本扫除青年文盲，五百多个农业社建立了俱乐部、图书室，乡乡社社都大办红专学校、技术夜校，群众诗歌创作也像雨后春笋般的开展起来。
    在这种形势下，书店党支部在组织职工深入学习党的社会主义建设总路线时，引导职工们讨论全国和当地的大跃进形势和图书发行工作如何面向生产，面向农村，通过检查工作批判了过去不重视农村发行工作的右倾保守思想。职工们制订了农村图书发行工作的跃进计划，分别到农村中去发行。
    这个书店在进行农村图书发行工作中，紧紧依靠群众，先了解群众需要再去满足群众需要。他们分组分片深入农业社和田间，了解农民学习情况和人数，向农民介绍适合于他们所需书籍的内容。丰光社缺棉花后期管理经验，他们就推荐介绍这方面经验的书籍，社员一下就买了几百本。他们还在帮助农民劳动中了解情况，根据不同情况供给书籍。
    大批图书供应到农村后，也促进了技术革命和文化革命，农民非常欢迎。九联二社团支部书记黄治南买到介绍王保京玉米丰产一书后，立即组织十多个青年学习王保京的玉米丰产经验，并马上照这些经验给几十亩玉米地补上苗，施了追肥。介绍张秋香棉花丰产经验的书，在棉区发行一万多册，许多社员都按这些经验去做，把这本书叫做“活老师”。许多社员说，“咱才摘掉文盲帽子，书店就把书送来，真是雪里送炭。”
    最近，陕西省文化局在长安县召开了农村文化现场会议，决定在全省推广这个县的经验。
