　　People's Power Will Surely Triumph Over the Forces of War
　　Chinese Peace Organizations Telegraph Congratulations to the Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
    The China Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee today respectively sent telegrams to congratulate the Fourth Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which is being held in Tokyo.
    In its telegram, the China Asian-African Solidarity Committee expressed its respect to the Japanese people who are ardently demanding peace and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, as well as to the peace fighters from various countries participating in the congress. It also sternly condemned the US-British imperialism for continuing nuclear weapons tests, refusing disarmament, intensifying arms expansion and war preparations, and carrying out armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, gravely threatening the national independence of Arab countries and the peace of the Middle East and the world. The telegram said: "The Chinese people resolutely support the efforts made by the Japanese people and all other peace-loving people of all countries to strive for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and general disarmament. We congratulate the success of the congress and look forward to the congress making beneficial contributions to stopping aggression, safeguarding peace, striving for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and realizing general disarmament."
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee warmly congratulated the convening of the congress in its congratulatory telegram. The telegram said: "The convening of the congress under the current situation is of great significance. US imperialism is the first country to use atomic weapons, and now it refuses to stop testing nuclear weapons. On the contrary, disregarding world public opinion, it is stepping up hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific region, establishing atomic bomb and rocket bases, gravely threatening the peace of this region and the world, and endangering the lives of mankind in vast areas. The people of Asia and the Pacific region cannot ignore the recent armed aggression of US-British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan. This aggression has disrupted the peace of the Middle East, aggravated the danger of war in the Middle East, and seriously threatened the peace and security of the whole world. We believe that the congress will surely reflect the strong sentiments of the people of Asia and the Pacific region who demand peace, safeguard national independence, and oppose US imperialist aggression, and will achieve significant achievements in the efforts to safeguard peace and prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    "We congratulate the success of the congress and congratulate the participating representatives for making new contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace. As long as the peace-loving people of the world unite and carry out a resolute struggle against the aggressive crimes of imperialism, the power of the people will surely triumph over the forces of war!"

　　人民力量必战胜战争力量
　　我和平团体电贺禁止原子弹氢弹日本大会
    新华社13日讯　中国亚非团结委员会和亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会今天分别打电报祝贺正在东京举行的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会日本大会。
    中国亚非团结委员会在电报中向热烈要求和平、要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的日本人民以及参加这次大会的各国和平战士表示敬意，并且严厉谴责了美英帝国主义继续进行核武器试验、拒绝裁军、加紧扩军备战、对黎巴嫩和约旦实行武装侵略，严重地威胁阿拉伯国家的民族独立、威胁中东和世界和平的各种罪恶活动。电报说：“中国人民坚决支持日本人民和其他一切爱好和平的各国人民对于争取禁止核武器和普遍裁军所作的努力。我们祝贺大会的成功，并期待大会对制止侵略、维护和平、争取禁止核武器和实现普遍裁军作出有益的贡献。”
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会在贺电中热烈祝贺大会的召开。电报说：“大会在当前形势下召开是有重要意义的。美帝国主义是首先使用原子武器的国家，现在又拒绝停止试验核武器，相反地，不顾世界舆论加紧在太平洋地区试验氢弹，建立原子弹和火箭基地，严重地威胁着这一地区和世界的和平并危害着广大地区人类的生命。亚洲、太平洋地区的人民也不能无视美英帝国主义最近对于黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略，这种侵略破坏了中近东的和平，加剧了中近东的战争危险，使全世界的和平和安全都受到严重威胁。我们相信大会一定会反映亚洲、太平洋地区人民要求和平、维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义侵略的强烈情绪，并且在维护和平和禁止原子弹氢弹方面的努力中取得重大的成就。
    “我们祝贺大会的成功，祝贺与会的代表对维护和平的事业作出新的贡献。只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来进行坚决的斗争，反对帝国主义的侵略罪行，人民的力量一定战胜战争的力量！”
