Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's farewell speech at Beijing Airport seeing off Prime Minister Sihanouk is as follows:

Your esteemed Royal Highness, friends, comrades:

　　Today, we gather here with boundless reluctance to bid farewell to our sincere friend, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the accompanying Cambodian dignitaries. After visiting Beijing, the Northeast, and various parts of Hebei, they are leaving today to visit Wuhan and Guangzhou, and then return home. At this moment of parting, please allow me, once again on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to express our heartfelt gratitude to Your Royal Highness for this gracious visit, to thank you for bringing the profound friendship of the Cambodian people to the Chinese people, and to thank you for your valuable contribution to further strengthening and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

　　Although Your Royal Highness's stay in our country has been brief, we believe that during this visit, you must have seen the deep affection the Chinese people hold for the Cambodian people. The Chinese people extend deep sympathy and firm support for the Cambodian people's just struggle to build their motherland, develop their economy, and safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

　　During your visit to our country, Your Royal Highness held several sincere and frank talks with our leaders on issues of common concern to our two countries and reached a consensus. The achievements of the talks have been fully reflected in the joint statement issued today. There is no doubt that this is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and will also be conducive to promoting the unity of Asian and African countries and maintaining peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. The traditional friendship between China and Cambodia has very broad prospects for development, and we have every reason to look forward to the future with confidence.

　　Your Royal Highness, please convey the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the Cambodian people, and please also convey my cordial greetings and best wishes to His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit and Her Majesty the Queen.

　　I wish Your Royal Highness and the accompanying Cambodian dignitaries a pleasant journey and safe travels!

　　Long live the close friendship between the people of China and Cambodia!

　　Long live the peace of Asia, Africa, and the world!
