The story of Kurban Tulum, a 75-year-old Uyghur farmer, longing to see Chairman Mao day and night, has been circulating in the Fifth District of Yutian County, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, for several years.

Kurban Tulum's past tragic experiences are an epitome of the life of Uyghur farmers under the old society at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains. He grew up in the cowshed of the landlord Ismu. The landlord's cruel exploitation caused him to lose his parents in his youth and become Ismu's slave. Then, he worked as a long-term laborer for the rich peasant Tala Ahong Tastum for sixteen years, and later lived under the oppression of land rent for more than ten years. In the hot summer, he was forced to the reed lake area, densely populated with mosquitoes, drinking dead water from the pond, and gnawing on hard corn rations, cutting reeds for the landlord day and night. In winter, he dug red willow firewood for the landlord for warmth on the Gobi Desert during the day, but at night he could only curl up and sleep in the earthen trenches on the Gobi Desert. Until liberation, Kurban Tulum's family had nothing but a felt blanket, a broken copper kettle, and a heavy debt.

**Wanting to See Chairman Mao in Person**

After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government rescued him from despair and he gained a new life. During the land reform in 1952, he struggled against the landlord at the meeting and was allocated fourteen mu of arable land and a house. He knew that all this happiness was bestowed upon him by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and he began to have the idea of seeing Chairman Mao in person. Whenever he met a cadre, he always said: "Let me see Chairman Mao with my own eyes, and I will be satisfied in this life." When the apricots ripened, he dried them; when the corn was harvested, he picked out the largest ones to keep; when the melons ripened, he picked the best two and stored them, ready to take them to see Chairman Mao at any time. "Write a letter to Chairman Mao for me, and greet Chairman Mao!" Old man Kurban Tulum often asked others like this. People dissuaded him, saying: "Chairman Mao is too busy, don't bother him." But Kurban Tulum still sent seven letters and apricot and peach dried fruit to Chairman Mao.

**Wanting to Ride a Donkey to Beijing**

The road of mutual aid and cooperation made his life more and more prosperous, and his desire to see Chairman Mao became stronger and stronger. After the bumper harvest in the autumn of 1955, Kurban Tulum made nearly a hundred catties of rations and made up his mind to ride a donkey to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. The cadres and villagers in the county repeatedly told him that Beijing was very far from Xinjiang and that he could not go there on a donkey, and only then did they persuade him to stay. If he couldn't go on a donkey, what should he do? Kurban Tulum carried dry food to the highway several times to stop cars, asking the drivers to take him to Beijing, but the drivers couldn't meet his requests. Almost every bazaar (market) day, he would ride his donkey to the county to visit the county party secretary to inquire about Chairman Mao. As long as he heard that Han Chinese leaders and Han Chinese cadres from other places had arrived in Yutian, he would try his best to invite these "people sent by Chairman Mao" to his home, boil eggs, dye them red, and ask them to eat them, lead them to visit, and pour out his desire to see Chairman Mao. One night in the spring of 1957, Wang Enmao, the First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other comrades arrived in Yutian. When Comrade Wang Enmao heard that the old man repeatedly wanted to see them, he took the time to visit Kurban Tulum's home with his colleagues. Wang Enmao kindly encouraged him to work hard in production and said to him: "In the future, if there is an opportunity, I will definitely find a way to let you go to Beijing once."

**Received a Reply from Chairman Mao**

Although Kurban Tulum's wish had not yet been realized, Chairman Mao and the General Office of the Central Committee had sent him four letters and a photo of Chairman Mao, plus the care of cadres at all levels, which greatly encouraged Kurban Tulum. He thought: I must listen to the Party and Chairman Mao and work hard. Over the past few years, he has been working diligently. Whenever he was tired, he would take out the photo sent by Chairman Mao to look at it, and immediately felt a burst of energy all over his body. In the days when the snow covered the ground and the cold wind was piercing, he also carried a bag to the Gobi Desert a dozen or twenty miles away to pick up fertilizer. In 1955 and 1956, he was twice selected as a model for accumulating fertilizer in the township and commune. He was a red flag in changing the local habit of planting with little fertilizer. Last year, he earned a total of 1,305 work points in the commune, and also accumulated 150,000 catties of manure, and was rated as a model fertilizer accumulator in the county. Last year, the wheat in the commune was yellow and ripe. In order to prevent the harvested wheat from being lost, he took the lead in rushing to harvest day and night. During the wheat harvest, he harvested nearly twenty mu by himself.

Kurban Tulum took the lead in responding to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, leaving a deep impression on the people in the township. In 1953, the old man not only actively participated in the mutual aid group, but also bought twelve ploughshares with the money he earned from his labor and gave them to the mutual aid groups in the township. In 1954, when a year-round mutual aid group was established, he bought a cow and gave it to the group for free use, and then he joined the cooperative. From 1953 to 1957, he sold a total of more than 4,900 catties of surplus grain.

**Airmail Letter from Beijing to Beijing**

Kurban Tulum's long-held wish to be a model, go to Beijing, and see Chairman Mao with his own eyes finally came true. In June of this year, Hotan Prefecture organized outstanding agricultural cooperative directors, technicians, and model laborers to visit the agricultural tool exhibition in Beijing, and he was also honored to participate. When the good news came, the old man immediately took out the gifts he had prepared: dried peaches, dried apricots, almonds, raisins, sunflower seeds, and large cloth, and was the first to arrive in the county. He couldn't wait to grow wings and fly to Beijing, to Chairman Mao. Along the way, he always murmured to the people he was traveling with: "This time I must see Chairman Mao." Every time the train arrived at a station, he would ask: "How far is this place from where Chairman Mao lives?"

During his visit to Beijing, Kurban Tulum looked forward to the news of Chairman Mao receiving them every day. Seeing that the visit was about to end, he had not received an accurate answer. The old man was so anxious that he couldn't eat or sleep for several days in a row. Others thought he was sick, but he said: "My illness will be cured if I see Chairman Mao." In Beijing, he also asked someone to write two letters to Chairman Mao for him. "What is the fastest way to send a letter?" he asked the people at the post office. They said that airmail was the fastest, so he sent an airmail letter to Chairman Mao, asking Chairman Mao to take the time to see him.

**Met Chairman Mao**

June 28th was the happiest day for Kurban Tulum. He and all the representatives got into the car to go to Zhongnanhai. His heart was so excited that it was about to jump out. When Chairman Mao with a smile on his face and the central leaders appeared in front of him, he was so happy that he forgot everything and stared at Chairman Mao intently. Just when Chairman Mao and other central leaders sat down to take a group photo with all the staff, he only cared about turning his head to look at Chairman Mao's side. Only the old man's head was turned towards the side where Chairman Mao was sitting in this photo. After the group photo, Chairman Mao walked kindly in front of him and shook his hand, and greeted him. The old man held Chairman Mao's hand tightly with both hands and was reluctant to let go for a long time. He presented gifts to Chairman Mao on the spot and shook hands with Chairman Mao happily again. The photographer took a picture at this time. When he told us about this, he kept picking up this photo and looking at it carefully. Kurban Tulum said excitedly: The day after the reception, Chairman Mao also specially sent someone to see me and gave me ten meters of corduroy.

After seeing Chairman Mao, the old man's mood has not calmed down, and he has not slept for four consecutive nights. The scene of Chairman Mao receiving them appeared in front of him like a movie. He felt that he was younger and had more strength. After returning, he would tell everything to every villager, and he would muster greater enthusiasm to engage in production, and he would do more to repay Chairman Mao.

### 库尔班·吐鲁木见到了毛主席

　　库尔班·吐鲁木见到了毛主席
    七十五岁的维吾尔族老农库尔班·吐鲁木，日夜想念毛主席的事，几年来一直在新疆维吾尔自治区于阗县五区流传着。
    库尔班·吐鲁木往昔的悲惨遭遇，是昆仑山下维吾尔族农民旧社会的生活缩影。他从小就生长在大地主依斯木的牛圈里。地主的残酷压榨，使他在少年时就失去了父母，变成了依斯木的奴隶。接着，他给富农塔拉阿洪·塔斯吐姆当了十六年长工，后来又在地租的压榨下过了十多年。炎热的夏天，他被迫到密聚蚊子的苇湖地带，饮着池里的死水，啃着干硬的包谷饷，日日夜夜给地主割芦苇。冬季，白天在戈壁滩上给地主挖红柳柴取暖，夜里自己却只能绻曲在戈壁滩上的土壕里露宿。直到解放时，库尔班·吐鲁木全家除了一条被毡子、一把破铜壶外，便是一身沉重的债务。
    想亲眼看看毛主席
    解放后，共产党和人民政府把他从绝望中拯救出来，获得了新生。1952年土地改革时，他在大会上斗争了地主，分得十四亩耕地和一所房子。他知道这些幸福都是共产党、毛主席赐给他的，开始产生了想亲眼看一看毛主席的念头。无论见到那一个干部，他总是说：“让我亲眼看看毛主席，我这一辈子就心满意足了”。杏子熟了，他就晾杏干；包谷丰收了，他就拣几个最大的留下；甜瓜熟了，他又摘两个最好的保存起来，准备随时带上去看毛主席。“替我给毛主席写封信，问候问候毛主席吧！”库尔班·吐鲁木老人常常这样请求别人，人们劝阻说：“毛主席太忙了，不要打扰他老人家。”但库尔班·吐鲁木还是先后寄出七封信，还给毛主席寄了杏干和桃干。
    要骑着毛驴上北京
    互助合作的道路，使他的生活越来越富裕，他想见毛主席的心愿也越来越强烈了。1955年秋季丰收后，库尔班·吐鲁木作了近百斤饷，打定主意骑着毛驴上北京去见毛主席。县上的干部和乡亲们再三告诉他：北京离新疆很远，骑毛驴去不了。才劝住了他。骑毛驴去不成，怎么办呢？库尔班·吐鲁木就几次背上干粮到公路上拦挡汽车，要求司机把他带到北京，司机们也无法满足他的要求。差不多每个巴扎（集市）天，他总要骑上毛驴到县里探望县委书记，向他打听毛主席的情况。只要听到汉族首长和外地的汉族干部到了于阗，他总是想尽办法把这些“毛主席派来的人”请到自己家里，煮上鸡蛋染红了请他们吃，领着他们参观，倾吐自己渴望见到毛主席的心情。1957年春天的一个夜晚，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂等同志到了于阗。当王恩茂同志听到这位老人再三要见见他们时，在百忙中和同行的人到了库尔班·吐鲁木家里。王恩茂亲切地鼓励他好好生产，并对他说：“将来有机会，一定设法让你到北京去一次”。
    收到了毛主席的回信
    库尔班·吐鲁木的愿望虽然还没有实现，但毛主席和中央办公厅曾经先后给他来了四封信，并寄来毛主席的照片，再加上各级干部的关心，使库尔班·吐鲁木受到极大的鼓励。他想着：一定要听党的话，听毛主席的话，好好劳动。几年来，他勤勤恳恳地劳动着。每当劳累了的时候，便拿出毛主席寄来的照片看一看，立时感到浑身有了一股热劲。在大雪盖地、寒风刺骨的日子里，他也背着口袋到一、二十里外的戈壁上去拾肥。1955年和1956年，他曾两次被选为乡、社积肥模范，在改变当地种地不多施肥的习惯上，他是一面红旗。去年他在社里共得了一千三百零五个工分，另外还积了十五万斤粪肥，又被评为县的积肥模范。去年社里的小麦黄熟了，为了使丰收的麦子不受损失，他带头日夜抢收，在收麦期间他一个人就割了近二十亩。
    库尔班·吐鲁木带头响应党和毛主席的号召，在乡里给人们留下了深刻的印象。1953年，老人不但积极参加了互助组，并且还用自己劳动得来的钱买了十二个犁铧，送给全乡的互助组。1954年成立常年互助组，他又买了一头牛交给组里无偿的使用，接着他又加入了合作社。从1953年到1957年的五年中，他一共卖出的余粮就有四千九百多斤。
    北京寄北京的航空信
    库尔班·吐鲁木多年来要当模范到北京亲眼看看毛主席的心愿，终于实现。今年6月间，和阗专区组织优秀的农业社主任、技术员和劳动模范去北京参观农具展览会，他也荣幸地参加了。当喜信传来的时候，老人立即拿出早已准备好的礼物：桃干、杏干、杏仁、葡萄干、葵花籽和大布，第一个来到县里，他恨不得插翅飞到北京，飞到毛主席的面前。一路上，他总是和同行的人叨念着：“这次可一定得见见毛主席”。火车每到一站，他就问：“这里离毛主席住的地方还有多远？”
    在北京参观的日子，库尔班·吐鲁木天天盼望毛主席接见他们的消息，眼看参观就要完了，还没有得到准确的答复。老人焦虑得接连几天吃不下饭，睡不着觉，别人以为他病了，他自己说：“我的病，见见毛主席就好了”。在北京，他还请人替他给毛主席写了两封信。“怎样寄信最快呢？”他问邮局的人，人家说航空信最快，果真他就寄了航空信给毛主席，要求毛主席一定抽空见见他。
    见到了毛主席
    6月28日，库尔班·吐鲁木最幸福的一天来到了。他和全体代表坐上汽车去中南海。他的心激动得就要跳出来。当脸带笑容的毛主席和中央首长出现在眼前时，他高兴得忘掉了一切，全神贯注地望着毛主席。就在毛主席和其他中央首长坐下来和全体人员合影时，他也只顾扭过头去看，这张照片上只有老人的头扭向毛主席坐的那边。合影完了，毛主席亲切地走在他的面前和他握手，并向他问好。老人用双手紧握着毛主席的手，很久也舍不得放开。他当场给毛主席献了礼物，又一次幸福地和毛主席握了手，摄影记者就在这时候拍了一张照片。他在向我们说这件事时，不断拿起这张照片来，仔细地端详着。库尔班·吐鲁木激动地说：接见后的第二天，毛主席还专门派人来看我，送给了我十公尺条绒。
    老人见到了毛主席后，心情一直平静不下来，一连四个夜晚都没有睡着觉。毛主席接见他们的情景像电影一样，不断出现在眼前。他觉得自己更年青了，力气更大了，回去后，要把这一切告诉给每个乡亲，要鼓足更大的干劲来搞生产，要作更多的事来报答毛主席。
