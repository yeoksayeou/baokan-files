Xinhua News Agency, August 1st. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries jointly held a reception this evening to welcome peace fighters from fourteen countries.

　　Among the sixty-one guests attending the reception were peace representatives from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Burma, Ceylon, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Vietnam, and other countries who were invited to visit China after attending the Stockholm "Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation." There were also members of the Mongolian delegation who were passing through Beijing on their way to Japan to attend the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament. They all arrived in Beijing today and in the past few days. Relevant peace figures from Japan, North Korea, and New Zealand in Beijing were also invited to attend the reception.

　　Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a welcome speech first. He said: The Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation was very successful. The conference condemned the aggressive acts of US and British imperialism in the Near East, called on the people of the world to support the struggle of the Arab people against US and British imperialist aggression, and also supported all struggles for national independence and against colonialism. The documents adopted by the conference reflected the common aspirations of peace-loving people in all countries of the world. The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the resolutions of the conference and will take practical actions to implement these resolutions.

　　Liu Ningyi said that we, the Chinese people, fully sympathize with and support every struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries to break free from the shackles of colonialism and to strive for national independence, because the Chinese people know deeply from their own experience that peace and national independence are inseparable.

　　Liu Ningyi emphasized that the Chinese people will always love peace and resolutely defend peace, because a peaceful environment is conducive to our carrying out socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically. However, the peace-loving Chinese people have never been afraid of war. If imperialism dares to launch a war, we will thoroughly eliminate it.

　　Argentine peace representative and radiology expert Zorrilla spoke on behalf of all Latin American peace representatives at the reception. He said that after all the Latin American representatives attended the Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation in Stockholm, they realized even more the importance of strengthening the friendship between the people of Latin American countries. The people of Latin American countries should work together for the cause of peace. They firmly support the Five Principles advocated by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. In his speech, Zorrilla also condemned the crimes of US and British imperialism in invading the Near East. He said that the people of Latin American countries are taking to the streets one after another to protest the US and British acts of aggression in the Near East.

　　Australian peace representative Hartley emphasized at the reception that they opposed the Australian government's erroneous attitude of supporting Britain's aggression in the Middle East. He also said that they had photographed many protest letters against US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East that the Chinese people had posted in front of the British Legation and were preparing to distribute them to the Australian people after returning home.

　　Liao Chengzhi and Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Mao Dun and Li Dequan, Vice Chairmen of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Ding Xilin, Vice President, and heads of various people's organizations, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital, gathered with peace fighters from various countries today, had cordial conversations, and constantly congratulated each other on peace and friendship.

    刘宁一说，我们中国人民完全同情和支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民为摆脱殖民主义枷锁，为争取民族独立的每一个斗争，因为中国人民根据自己的经验深深知道：和平与民族独立是不可分的。
    刘宁一强调说，中国人民永远热爱和平和坚决捍卫和平，因为在和平环境中，才有利于我们更多、更快、更好、更省地进行社会主义建设。但是，热爱和平的中国人民从来也不害怕战争，帝国主义胆敢发动战争，就把它彻底消灭。
