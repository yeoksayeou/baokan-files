How the Ethnic Street Can Exert the Party's Leadership
By our reporter Zhang Wei

	I. The Ideological Struggle between Collectivism and Localism

	The Ethnic Street in Wuhan's Jianghan District began to propose implementing the Party's unified leadership around July and August of last year. At that time, a heavy and urgent task—stabilizing the emotions of primary and secondary school graduates and mobilizing graduates to go to the countryside for production—was assigned from the city. Liu Qizhi, the Party branch secretary, felt that the task was arduous, and if they continued to do things their own way as in the past, relying solely on one department, it would be impossible to complete. He then unified and organized the forces of the sub-district office, the Communist Youth League branch, the Women's Federation, etc., to jointly complete the education and organization of graduates, with the branch committee members taking responsibility for different sections. This approach immediately sparked debate. Some people thought it was correct for the Party branch to unify leadership and that the Party branch should lead the completion of central tasks; however, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch said that the Party's approach hindered the independence of the League's work, and the director of the sub-district office said that the Party branch was monopolizing administrative affairs. Others said that the sub-district had never done this before, and they questioned whether this new approach was correct.

	Indeed, in the past, there had never been a unified leadership situation in the work of Ethnic Street. The sub-district office, police station, Women's Federation, and Communist Youth League all worked independently without cooperation. Now that the Party committee was unifying leadership, some comrades naturally felt surprised or even disagreed ideologically. Therefore, how should the sub-district Party branch work? Should it lead and urge various departments to jointly complete central tasks while also cooperating to complete their respective departmental tasks? Should the Party "unify"? This became an urgent ideological problem to be solved. Soon, rectification began in the sub-district. The masses sharply criticized the lack of coordination in various aspects of work, which often led to "collisions," and also said that the Party branch committee members' work was not thorough. The Party branch then mobilized the branch committee members to discuss the tasks of the Party branch. A debate unfolded among the branch committee members, and they also repeatedly studied the Party Constitution, combined with examining the localist thinking of some comrades and their understanding of the Party's unified leadership. After four or five discussions, the branch committee members generally reached a consensus, affirming the following points: all work in the entire sub-district must be discussed by the Party branch before it can be implemented; all mass activities in the entire sub-district must be arranged by the Party branch in a unified way; branch committee members are responsible for different areas, implementing the "three responsibilities" (responsibility for completing central tasks, responsibility for completing various aspects of professional work, and responsibility for political and ideological education of the masses).

	However, implementing the Party's "three unifications, three responsibilities, and one-element leadership" was not smooth sailing in Ethnic Street, but rather went through a continuous struggle between collectivist and localist thinking. Sometimes, although some branch committee members understood the idea in the meeting, they did not understand it in actual work; sometimes, the leading comrades above understood it, but the comrades doing the specific work below did not. For example, in January and February of this year, the central task of the entire sub-district was to organize more than 8,000 housewives to speak out. The Party branch decided that all forces should go all out, with one comrade from the sub-district office and one from the police station being responsible for mobilizing and organizing the speaking out in each neighborhood committee. However, some police officers thought that organizing residents to speak out was doing work for the Party branch and was a bit "improper"; they said, "During the rectification, our task should be to strengthen security work." At this time, the Party branch explicitly stipulated in the sub-district's rectification plan that central tasks should be combined with departmental professional work, and each department should formulate a plan for combining central tasks with its own work. Therefore, while everyone was fully completing the central tasks, their respective professional work could also be completed in conjunction. During the upsurge of rectification in February, the police station's work also made great progress. In addition to listening to the masses' opinions on public security work, they also obtained many situations provided by the masses, many of which the police station had not grasped in the past. This was of great benefit to the public security department in accumulating materials, carrying out the struggle against the enemy, and grasping the political thinking of the residents.

	In order to ensure the collective leadership of the Party branch, the Ethnic Street Party branch holds a branch committee meeting once a month to specifically check the collective leadership of the branch and the ideological style of each branch committee member. There was a period when the comrades from the sub-district office only focused on carrying out their own work when working below, and did not care about security work at all. The police station director criticized the sub-district office director at the meeting: "Cooperation is from all sides, you can't ignore our work." Later, when the comrades from the sub-district office were assigning tasks to the neighborhood committees, they always remembered to assign security work and repeatedly publicized the importance of security work.

	Now, the cadres in various aspects of Ethnic Street have generally established relatively firm collectivist thinking. While everyone is working together to complete the central tasks, the cooperation between them is very good. Taking the police station as an example, the director and the police officers all realize that the work of the sub-district is consistent with their own work, and that by doing other people's work well, their own work will also be done well. Therefore, in their work, they always actively assist other units. For example, the Women's Federation proposed that the entire sub-district should be turned into a nursery, but there was only one full-time cadre, the director of the Women's Federation, and it was difficult to carry out the work. The police officers helped the Women's Federation run nurseries, find houses, and select teachers. As a result, in less than twenty days, twelve nurseries and twenty-six kindergarten classes were set up in the entire sub-district, and the entire sub-district was turned into a nursery. Regarding this matter, the director of the police station, Wu Jiafang, felt that: "This is also good for our own security work, because by running kindergarten classes, children are organized, which can also reduce traffic and fire accidents. In particular, it plays a greater role in educating children to reduce crime."

	II. Give Play to the Role of Resident Branches

	In the past, the Ethnic Street Party branch mainly did the work of housewives, but now the situation has changed. The city and district have delegated ten or so items related to the lives of the masses to the sub-district. Therefore, the Party branch not only has to manage housewives, but also primary schools, grain stores, vegetable markets, small vendors, and sub-district-run factories and production groups. At this time, the Party branch proposed that the work of residents should rely on the resident branches to play a role, and decided to start with the Third Branch first.

	The Third Branch has a total of seven Party members, six of whom are housewives, distributed in four neighborhood committees. The branch secretary, Huang Yuqing, is a housewife who is nearly fifty years old. When she heard that the Party branch had handed over the political and ideological work of the neighborhood committee to their branch, she was worried and could not sleep for several nights, constantly muttering to herself: "How can this be done?" The Party branch asked her to participate in the city's branch work leap forward conference. At this meeting, the experience of the Hankou Loading and Unloading Station Second Branch in making friends with everyone was promoted. She thought to herself: "They are a branch, and we are also a branch. Why can they play such a big role, but we can't?" Then, she and the Party members studied the deeds of the revolutionary mother Xu Dama. She was determined to learn from the experience of the Loading and Unloading Station Second Branch, do a good job in the political and ideological work of the four neighborhood committees, and strive to become a "six-good" branch. The enthusiasm of the branch secretary drove all the Party members, and all the Party members formulated plans to strive to become "five-good" Party members.

	The Third Branch organized Party members and resident cadres to make friends, and resident cadres made friends with residents, one link after another, and everyone did ideological work. Seven Party members made seventeen friends, and activists made one hundred and twenty-one friends. Everyone often went to the homes of "friends" to chat and help "friends" solve ideological and practical problems. When Party members did ideological work, they paid attention to cooperating with the central tasks of the Party branch. Recently, during the adjustment and re-election of the neighborhood committees, resident cadres reflected many ideological problems. Some people were unwilling to come out to work again, and some people were afraid of losing face if they were not re-elected. In response to this situation, the branch first unified its thinking within the Party and then assigned tasks for individual talks. Within a week, the number of individual talks reached one hundred and twenty-eight. At the same time, the branch also organized everyone to study the deeds of Fang Heming, who went from Red Army regimental commander to farmer. Because the ideological work was grasped tightly, the resident cadres were in high spirits after the organizational adjustment. Some people originally said, "Kill me and I won't do resident work," but later said, "You can ask me to do anything."

	After the strengthening of political and ideological work, two of the seven Party members who were originally inactive are now all playing a role, and 99% of the resident cadres who were originally 30% to 40% unwilling to come out to work are now happily coming out to work. Many tasks can be done immediately once the Party branch calls for them.

	The experience of the Third Branch has been promoted in the other three resident branches. An ideological work network is gradually forming among the more than 8,000 adult residents in the entire sub-district.

	III. Systematically Cultivating and Educating Resident Activists

	After the Ethnic Street implemented the "three unifications, three responsibilities, and one-element leadership," each branch committee member had to be responsible for a section and conduct regular ideological education for resident activists. In addition to this, the Party branch also took many measures to cultivate and educate resident activists. In June, the Party branch held a spare-time political training class, with seven or eight hundred resident activists regularly attending. Now, the training class has held two classes, one was given by a female veteran of the Long March from the city's 201 Factory who told stories about the Long March; the other was given by the director of the Wuhan Women's Federation on the "five goods." After the lectures, the neighborhood committees organized discussions separately. Secondly, the branches separately organized activists and the masses to study the deeds of an advanced person and other aspects of study every month. Now, the deeds of the revolutionary mother Xu Dama, Fang Heming, who went from Red Army regimental commander to farmer, and the "five goods" issues have been studied. The Party branch also called on the neighborhood committees to organize newspaper reading groups. Now all thirteen neighborhood committees in the sub-district have newspaper reading groups. Some newspaper reading groups read the newspaper every morning, and some read it every other day. The focus of reading is on national events and new people and new things. In addition, the branch assigns someone to conduct individual cultivation for activists who apply to join the Party.

	IV. Things are Easier to Do

	Liu Qizhi, the Party branch secretary of Ethnic Street, told me that since they fully realized the Party's unified leadership, the tasks of the Party have been completed many times faster and better than in the past because ideological work has been greatly strengthened. As soon as the Party called for the establishment of newspaper reading groups, the neighborhood committees established them within a week. As soon as the Party called for the establishment of a grain storage mutual aid committee to regulate grain shortages on its own, the neighborhood committees each organized one within five days. The thirteen neighborhood committees had a total of more than 5,000 households participating, storing more than 8,000 jin of grain in June and transferring 2,500 jin. Now, there are twenty-six factories and production groups in Ethnic Street that have been put into production, with more than 500 people participating in production, most of whom are housewives.

    民族街如何发挥党的领导作用
    本报记者  张碨
    一、集体主义和本位主义的思想斗争
    武汉市江汉区民族街开始提出贯彻党的统一领导，是去年7、8月间的事情。那时候，一项繁重而紧迫的任务——稳定中小学毕业生的情绪，动员毕业生下乡生产，从市里布置下来了。党总支书记刘奇志觉得任务繁重，如果还像过去那样各搞一套，光靠一个部门去做，是无法完成的。便将办事处、团总支、妇联等的力量统一组织起来，共同完成毕业生的教育和组织工作，并由支委分块块包干。这种作法立即引起了大家的争论。有人认为党总支这样统一领导是正确的，党总支应该领导中心工作的完成；但是，团总支书记却说党这种作法妨碍了团的工作的独立性，办事处主任说党总支包办了行政；还有人说过去街道从来没有这样做过，现在这样作是不是正确。
    的确，过去民族街的街道工作中，从来没有出现过统一领导的局面，办事处、派出所、妇联、共青团都是互不协作各搞一套。现在由党委来统一领导，自然有的同志就会感到突然，甚至思想不通了。因此，街道党总支应该怎样工作？该不该领导和督促各部门共同完成中心工作，同时互相协作完成各部门的业务工作？党该不该“统”？便开始成为大家思想上急需解决的问题。不久，街道整风开始了。群众对各方面工作不协调，经常“碰头打架”的现象提出了尖锐的批评，还说党总支委员的工作不深入。党总支便发动支委讨论党总支的任务。总支委员之间展开了辩论，同时反复学习了党章，并结合检查了某些同志的本位主义思想，和对党的统一领导的认识。经过四、五次的讨论，支委的思想大体上取得了一致，肯定了以下几条：全街各项工作必须经过总支讨论后才能往下贯彻；全街群众活动必须经过总支统一安排；总支委员按片负责，实行三包（包中心工作的完成，包各方面的业务工作的完成，包对群众的政治思想教育）。
    但是，贯彻党的“三统三包一元化”的领导，在民族街并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过了集体主义和本位主义思想的不断斗争。有时有的总支委员在会上虽然思想通了，到实际工作中却又不通了；有时上面的领导同志通了，下面做具体工作的同志又不通。例如今年1、2月份全街的中心工作是组织八千多名家庭妇女鸣放，总支决定各方面力量全力以赴，每一个居民委员会有一个办事处的同志和一个派出所的同志包干发动和组织鸣放。但是，有些民警以为组织居民鸣放是替总支做了工作，有点“不务正业”，他们说：“整风中我们的任务应该是加强保卫工作”。这时，总支便在全街整风方案中明确规定了中心工作与部门业务工作结合，并由各部门拟出中心工作结合本身工作的计划来。因此，大家在全力完成中心工作的同时，各自的业务工作也能结合完成。在2月份整风高潮中，派出所的业务就同时有了很大成绩，他们除了听取了群众对公安工作的意见外，还得到了群众提供的许多情况，其中有许多是派出所过去没有掌握的。这对公安部门积累材料开展对敌斗争和掌握居民的政治思想有很大好处。
    为了保证党总支的集体领导，民族街党总支每月召开一次总支委员会，专门检查总支的集体领导和每个总支委员的思想作风。有一个时期，办事处同志在下边工作时，只管开展自己的工作，对治安工作一点不管，派出所所长就在会上对办事处主任提出了批评：“协作是各方面的，你们不能对我们的工作一点也不管。”后来，办事处的同志在向居民委员会布置工作时，总记着布置治安工作，并反复宣传治安工作的重要性。
    现在，民族街各方面的干部一般都树立了比较坚定的集体主义思想，在大家同心合力完成中心工作的同时，互相之间的协作是很好的。以派出所来说，所长和民警们都认识到街道工作和自己的工作是一致的，作好了人家的工作，自己的工作也就做好了。因此，他们在工作中，总是积极协助别的单位工作。如妇联提出全街要托儿化，但脱产干部只有妇联主任一人，工作很难开展。民警就帮助妇联办托儿站，找房子挑教员。结果，不到二十天时间，全街就办起十二个托儿站和二十六个幼儿班，全街托儿化了。对这件事情，所长吴家舫感到：“这对我们自己的治安工作也有好处，因为通过办幼儿班，把儿童组织起来了，也可以减少交通和防火事故。特别是在教育儿童减少犯罪方面起了更大的作用。”
    二、发挥居民支部的作用
    过去，民族街党总支主要是做家庭妇女的工作，可是现在情况变了，市、区把十来项有关群众生活的工作的权力下放到街道了，因此，党总支不仅要管家庭妇女，还得管小学，管粮店、菜场、小商小贩、街办的工厂和生产组等。这时，党总支便提出了居民工作要依靠居民支部发挥作用的建议，并决定首先由第三支部作起。
    第三支部共有七个党员，有六个是家庭妇女，分布在四个居民委员会里。支部书记黄玉清是个将近五十岁的家庭妇女。她一听说总支将居民委员会的政治思想工作交给了她们支部来作，就担心得几晚上没有睡好觉，心里一直嘀咕着：“这怎么搞得了？”总支让她去参加全市支部工作跃进大会，这个会上推广了汉口装卸二站支部人人交朋友的经验。她心里想：“人家是个支部，我们也是个支部，为什么人家能起那样大作用，我们就不能起作用？”接着，她和党员学习了革命母亲徐大妈的事迹。她下定决心学习装卸二站支部的经验，把四个居民委员会的政治思想工作作好，争取成为六好支部。支部书记的干劲带动了所有党员，所有党员都制订了争取五好党员的计划。
    三支部组织党员和居民干部交朋友，居民干部又和居民交朋友，一环扣一环，人人都作思想工作。七个党员交了十七个朋友，积极分子交了一百二十一个朋友。大家常常上门去和“朋友”谈心，帮助“朋友”解决思想问题和具体问题。党员们做思想工作的时候，注意了配合总支的中心工作。最近调整和改选居民委员会的时候，居民干部反映了许多思想问题，有的人不愿意再出来工作，有的人怕改选掉了丢人。支部针对这个情况，首先在党内统一了思想，然后分工进行个别谈话，一个星期内，个别谈话的次数达一百二十八次。同时，支部还组织大家学习了由红军团长到农民的方和明的事迹。因为思想工作抓得紧，调整组织后，居民干部情绪都很高。有的人原来说：“杀了我也不干居民工作”，后来说：“叫我干什么也可以”。
    政治思想工作加强之后，七个党员中原来有两个不起作用，现在个个都起作用，居民干部中原来有30％到40％不愿出来工作，现在99％都高高兴兴地出来工作。许多工作总支一号召，立即就可以做好。
    三支部的经验，已在其他三个居民支部中推广。全街八千多成年居民中，一个思想工作网正在逐步形成。
    三、系统地培养教育居民积极分子
    民族街在实行了“三统三包一元化”的领导之后，每个支委都要分片包干对居民积极分子经常的进行思想教育工作。除此而外，总支还采取了许多办法培养和教育居民积极分子。6月份，总支举办了一个业余政治训练班，经常上课的有七、八百名居民积极分子。现在，训练班已经上过两次课，一次是由本市二○一厂一个妇女长征干部讲长征故事；一次是由武汉市妇联主任讲“五好”。讲课后，各居民委员会都分别组织了讨论。其次是由支部分别组织积极分子和群众每月学习一个先进人物的事迹和其他方面的学习。现在学习过的有：革命母亲徐大妈，昔日红军团长今日农民方和明的事迹，以及“五好”问题。总支还号召各居民委员会组织了读报组，现在全街十三个居民委员会都有了读报组。有的读报组每天早上读报，有的是隔一天读一次。读的重点是国家大事和新人新事。另外，对申请入党的积极分子，都由支部指定专人进行个别培养。
    四、事情好做了
    民族街党总支书记刘奇志告诉我说，自从他们充分实现了党的统一领导之后，由于思想工作大大加强了，党的任务完成起来比过去不知快了多少倍，好了多少倍。党一号召成立读报组，各居民委员会一个礼拜内就成立了。党一号召成立粮食储蓄互助委员会，自行调剂缺粮。五天内，各居民委员会都各组织成了一个，十三个居民委员会共有五千多户居民参加，6月份存了八千多斤粮食，调剂出去二千五百斤。现在，民族街已经投入生产的工厂和生产组有二十六个，参加生产的有五百多人，其中绝大部分是家庭妇女。
