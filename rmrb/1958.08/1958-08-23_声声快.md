　　Sounds Increasingly Fast
  　Guo Moruo
    Li Qingzhao (also known as Li Yi'an) has a poem "Sheng Sheng Man" (Sounds Slowly), which vividly expresses the personal sentiment of "dreary, desolate, and wretched." That can be said to be the face of the old era.

    I am now writing a poem with the same title, but reversing its meaning, to reflect the current high tide of the Great Leap Forward where "one day equals twenty years," so I changed the title to "Sheng Sheng Kuai" (Sounds Increasingly Fast).

    "Sheng Sheng Man" is sometimes written as "Sheng Sheng Man," also known as "Ren Zai Lou Shang" (A Person Upstairs). "Man" (slow) is the tune name, and previous people said "slow means a long and leisurely tune." Now it is changed to "Kuai" (fast), which can be regarded as an abbreviation of "Allegro."

    Roaring and vigorous, joyous and happy, intimate and close,
    Six hundred million people leaping forward, heaven and earth shattering.
    The poor and blank state, must be eliminated in a few years!
    The more, the better, look at today, heroes and heroines everywhere.
    The grand resolution of the Eighth National Congress,
    Nineteen characters, have already summarized the route.
    Gather all strength, strive to go upstream with all our might!
    More, faster, better, and more economical,
    We must add, hundreds of millions of tons of steel.
    Intensify the building of socialism!
            (August 19, 1958)

　　声声快
  　郭沫若
    李易安有“声声慢”一词，入骨地诉说了“冷冷清清、凄凄惨惨戚戚”的个人情趣。那也可以说是旧时代的面貌。
    我如今和她一首，但一反其意，以反映当前“一天等于二十年”的大跃进高潮，因而把词牌名改为“声声快”。
    “声声慢”或作“胜胜慢”，别名“人在楼上”。“慢”是调名，前人云“慢者调长声缓”。今改为“快”，可以看作是“快板”之省。
    轰轰烈烈，喜喜欢欢，亲亲热热密密，
    六亿人民跃进，天崩地裂。
    一穷二白面貌，要使它几年消灭！
    多益善，看今朝，遍地英雄豪杰。
    八大煌煌议决，
    十九字，已将路线总结。
    鼓足劲头，争赴上游须力！
    多快更兼好省，
    要增添，亿吨钢铁。
    加紧地将社会主义建设！
            （一九五八年八月十九日）
