According to a report in the Anhui Daily, Huoshan County in Anhui Province has independently developed three types of firebricks with different formulations. These bricks have been tested at temperatures exceeding 1600 degrees Celsius, proving their good quality. The material ratios for these three types of firebricks are as follows: First type: White clay 20%, Bauxite 40%, Porcelain clay 40%; Second type: Quartz 40%, White clay 60%; Third type: White clay 5%, Bauxite 80%, Porcelain clay 15%.

During the large-scale iron and steel industry campaign, Huoshan County had a significant need for firebricks, but ordering them from elsewhere presented difficulties. In this situation, the Huoshan County Committee decided to solve the problem through self-reliance. In early July, they began trial production of firebricks at the Foziling Kiln. During the trial production process, lacking crushing machines, they used stone mortars, pestles, and manual labor for crushing, followed by coarse sieving. Lacking technical experience, they organized brick and tile kiln workers to visit and learn from other places. Now, according to the decision of the Huoshan County Committee, a new kiln with a capacity of 10,000 firebricks, built in Foziling, was completed and put into production on August 1st. In addition, a larger kiln with a capacity of 20,000 bricks is under construction and is expected to be put into production in September. Once these two kilns are fully operational, they can produce 2,000 to 2,500 tons of firebricks this year to support the iron and steel industry.

　　霍山大造耐火砖
    据安徽日报报道  安徽省霍山县自力更生试制成三种不同配料的耐火砖。这些砖经过一千六百多度的高温考验，证明质量良好。这三种耐火砖的配料比例是，第一种：白土20％，矾土40％，瓷土40％；第二种：石英40％，白土60％；第三种：白土5％，矾土80％，瓷土15％。
    霍山县在大办钢铁工业中，对耐火砖的需要量很大，到外地订购又有困难。在这种情况下，霍山县委决定以自力更生的办法来解决。7月初，他们便在佛子岭窑厂进行耐火砖试制工作。在试制过程中，他们没有破碎机，就用舂米的石碓、碓锤及人工进行破碎，然后再用粗筛子筛；缺乏技术经验，就组织砖瓦窑工人到外地参观学习。现在，根据霍山县委的决定，在佛子岭新建的一座容量一万块耐火砖的炉窑，已于8月1日建成投入生产；此外，还正在建设一座容量两万块砖的大窑，9月份也可以投入生产。这两座窑全部投入生产以后，今年内可生产两千吨到两千五百吨耐火砖，支援钢铁工业。
