	The Railway Under Construction
	A forest railway leading to the top of Changbai Mountain has already begun construction. Changbai Mountain is more than 2,700 meters above sea level, and it is one of China's famous high mountains and a major timber producing area. After the forest railway leading to the top of Changbai Mountain is completed, the time it takes to climb to the top of Changbai Mountain from Linjiang County can be greatly shortened.

    正修建的铁路
    一条通向长白山顶的森林铁路已经开工修建。长白山海拔二千七百多公尺，是我国有名的高山和主要的木材产地之一。这条通向长白山顶的森林铁路修通后，从临江县登上长白山顶的时间可以大大缩短。  （李华祥）
