　　Provinces and Cities Take Emergency Measures
    To Ensure the Iron and Steel Marshal Sings a Triumphant Song
　　Anhui
    Our Newspaper News: Reporter Tang Tianzhen reports: The steel experimental field established by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has blossomed and borne fruit. The first 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace newly built by the Steel Plant of the Provincial Party Committee has been put into production earlier this month, setting a red flag for the entire province to run iron and steel industry on a large scale.
    Now, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has, based on the construction and production of this small blast furnace, conducted research and summarized the design, construction, installation, start-up, technical operation, and accident handling of the small blast furnace, so as to be applied to the construction and production of more than 500 small blast furnaces of 8 to 28 cubic meters that are under construction or about to be built throughout the province.
    This 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace was built using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Except for a small amount of steel plate used for the furnace belly, the exterior of the furnace body is entirely made of red bricks. In the process of construction, it has received support from all sides and created a relatively complete set of experience. It has greatly promoted the construction of small blast furnaces throughout the province.
    The Steel Plant of the Provincial Party Committee was established by Comrade Zeng Xisheng, the First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, with party fees. Its scale includes four 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces, four 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces, four 55-cubic-meter blast furnaces, a steelmaking workshop, and a rolling mill workshop. After the completion of all the projects, it can produce 160,000 tons of iron, 100,000 tons of steel, and more than 80,000 tons of steel products annually. At present, in addition to the first small blast furnace being built and put into production, the other three 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces are also under construction.
    Also reported: In order to make a new deployment for the development of the iron and steel industry, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee on the morning of the 20th, convened a telephone conference of secretaries of local party committees and municipal party committees that evening, and convened a meeting of relevant departments on the morning of the 22nd to convey and earnestly discuss the relevant instructions of the Central Committee.
    The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee decided to take measures to focus on steel production throughout the province, requiring the first secretaries of local, municipal, and county party committees to personally take charge. It also pointed out that steel production is the central task that overrides everything else at present, and is the key to all work, and all relevant departments should fully support steel production.
　　Shanghai
    Our Newspaper Shanghai, August 25th: Go all out to ensure that the two "marshals" of steel and machinery pass the test! This is the central task proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for the city's industrial production front in the last four months of this year. At the emergency cadre meeting held on the 23rd, the Municipal Party Committee also specifically put forward the targets for steel and machinery production that the city must guarantee to complete this year. The main ones are: 1.2 million tons of steel, complete sets of smelting equipment with an annual output of 2.8 million tons of steel, complete sets of power generation equipment of 547,000 kilowatts, and 15,000 various machine tools. At the meeting, the Municipal Party Committee required party organizations in various departments, especially party organizations in steel, machinery, and related departments, to immediately start working, rely on the masses, and conscientiously grasp the work of ensuring the completion of national plans.
    In terms of increasing steel production, the meeting put forward specific measures such as increasing the amount of smelting, shortening the smelting time, and appropriately developing small-scale steelmaking using old equipment. According to calculations, after taking these measures, the steel plants under the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau alone can increase production by tens of thousands of tons of steel.
    The meeting demanded accelerating the progress of capital construction. Key projects related to the increase in steel and machinery production must be guaranteed to complete the construction and installation tasks on time, in quantity, and with quality. It required that transportation work keep up with the situation and guarantee the needs of steel and machinery production tasks.
    The meeting also decided to launch a mass movement to save electricity throughout the city and reduce peak loads.
　　Jiangsu
    Our Newspaper Nanjing, August 25th: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a steel industry meeting attended by local and municipal party committee secretaries on the 23rd and 24th, and determined eight measures to accelerate the production and construction of the steel industry.
    The meeting, targeting the situation where some "shaking heads before the furnace" were using the inability of some indigenous blast furnaces to produce iron normally as an excuse to deny the role of indigenous blast furnaces and place their hopes on foreign blast furnaces, first criticized this idea of "loving the foreign and disliking the indigenous." The meeting believed that this was essentially a right-leaning conservative idea that hindered the current development of steel production, and party committees at all levels should launch a resolute struggle against this idea.
    In order to effectively strengthen the specific leadership of steel production, the meeting determined: the first secretaries of party committees at all levels should personally grasp steel production, and municipal party committees should go all out to organize steel armies, and take the method of "fixing the type, fixing the group, fixing the person, and fixing the quantity," with each level responsible. The main leading cadres of the party committee should immediately carry out experimental furnaces. Grasp the progress every day, and check it every three days. At present, focus mainly on grasping steel, smelting equipment, machinery, mining, and electricity. All raw materials, equipment, and labor must first obey the needs of key points. The key projects allocated by the central government must be completed with all efforts first. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen technical leadership and cultivate a steel technical team at the fastest speed.
　　Henan
    Our Newspaper News: From the 21st to the 23rd, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China successively convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and an emergency meeting of the first secretaries of local and municipal party committees, and made specific deployments for future steel production. The meeting determined to "take steel as the key link," deeply mobilize the masses, race against time, greatly grasp steel production, and ensure the overfulfillment of the province's leap forward plan to produce 1.5 million tons of iron, 300,000 tons of steel ingots, and 100,000 tons of steel this year.
    In order to ensure the victorious completion of the steel production task, the meeting repeatedly emphasized that it is necessary to put politics in command, the first secretary of the party committee must personally take action, and the whole party and the whole people must be mobilized to engage in steel production on a large scale. The meeting decided that all localities must currently seize the opportunity to summarize the experience of steel production and hold more on-site meetings. Vigorously promote the experience of iron smelting with simple equipment and that can be quickly put into production, large-scale production, and normal production.
　　Hubei
    Our Newspaper News: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an emergency telephone conference on the night of the 21st, requiring the entire party to firmly grasp steel production and ensure the completion of the national steel leap forward plan.
    Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out at the telephone conference that grasping steel production and enabling the completed furnaces to quickly move to normal production is a hurdle in the current large-scale steel industry. This hurdle must be overcome.
    In order to ensure the completion of the national steel leap forward plan, the Provincial Party Committee determined that the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee should concentrate their main efforts on grasping the steel industry in the future and check it every seven days. Local county party committees should ensure that the first secretary personally takes charge and solves the problems of transferring cadres, labor, supplying raw materials, and transportation. At the same time, mobilize cadres and the masses to learn technology, combine "indigenous" and "foreign" methods, with "indigenous" methods as the main focus, and improve on the basis of popularization, and implement the mass line.
　　Heilongjiang
    Our Newspaper News: At the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on the 21st, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to further promote the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. The Provincial Party Committee should focus its main efforts on grasping the main links such as the production of steel, metallurgical equipment, and large-scale power generation equipment.
    The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to fully utilize the existing industrial base, tap potential forces, and vigorously support the industrial construction of brotherly regions across the country. The Provincial Party Committee proposed that first of all, every effort should be made to ensure the early completion of the construction project of the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant, which manufactures large-scale metallurgical equipment for the country, and to ensure the great leap forward in the production of complete sets of power generation equipment such as large-scale boilers, steam turbines, and generators for the country, so as to fully meet the needs of the country's large-scale construction of the iron and steel industry and the power industry. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee decided to concentrate and unify the strength of the entire party and the entire people, and take the method of "indigenous, small, and mass" as the main method, that is, mainly using indigenous methods and semi-indigenous and semi-foreign methods, to quickly establish small blast furnace groups in every iron ore area that has been discovered. At the same time, it is required that areas with a certain industrial base and the mechanical industry departments should manufacture mechanized blast furnaces. The Provincial Party Committee also decided to grasp the two important links of mining and rolling steel to lay a good foundation for the further development of the steel industry.
    Finally, it emphasized strengthening unified planning, strengthening leadership and collaboration, and promptly resolving and adjusting various specific issues such as equipment, labor, technology, and transportation. (Attached picture)
