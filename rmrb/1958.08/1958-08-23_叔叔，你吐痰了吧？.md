　　“Uncle, did you spit?”
　　One Sunday, I was strolling down the street. When I reached the front of the city fire brigade, I suddenly felt the urge to spit. What to do? I looked around, but there were no public spittoons, and I didn’t have a handkerchief with me, so I just "ptui" spit on the road. I had only taken a few steps when a little girl wearing a red scarf walked towards me and stopped me. The little girl politely said, "Uncle, did you spit?" "Yes, I did!" I said, trying to avoid her and continue walking. But she grabbed the corner of my clothes and said sternly, "Uncle, please wait a moment before you leave!" I didn't know what she meant, so I had to stop. I saw her quickly take out a small red piece of paper from her schoolbag and give it to me, saying, "Uncle, please don't spit everywhere in the future. There are germs in sputum, which can easily infect others. If you have phlegm, please spit it into a handkerchief!" At this moment, I felt my face burning with embarrassment. I said, "Okay, I won't spit everywhere again..." She smiled and said, "Uncle, sorry to have kept you from your business..."
　　After I read the red paper slip that said, "Comrade, please don't spit everywhere," I realized that this little girl was a Young Pioneer sanitation monitor.

　　“叔叔，你吐痰了吧？”
    星期天，我上街蹓躂，走到市消防队门前，突然想吐痰，怎么办呢？四处一望，没有公共痰盂，又没带手帕，于是就“呸”一口吐在马路上。刚走几步，迎面走来一位带着红领巾的小姑娘，把我拦住。小姑娘有礼貌地说：“叔叔，你吐痰了吧？”“是呀！，吐啦！”我说着想躲开她，继续往前走。但是她拉住了我的衣角，很严厉地说：“叔叔，请你等一会儿再走！”我不知她是什么意思，只好站下了。只见她急忙从书包里，掏出一张红色小纸条给我，说：“叔叔，请你今后不要随地吐痰，痰里有病菌，容易传染别人。如有痰请吐在手帕里吧！”这时，我觉着脸热乎乎的很不好意思。我说：“好吧，以后再不随地吐痰了……”她微笑地说：“叔叔，对不起，耽误你办事啦……”
    当我看了那张写着“同志，请你不要随地吐痰”的红纸条以后，才知道这小姑娘是红领巾卫生监督岗。
