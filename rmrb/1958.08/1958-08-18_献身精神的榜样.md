A Model of Dedication
　　Guō Mòruò
Professor Joliot-Curie was a world-renowned and outstanding atomic physicist. His original surname was Joliot, but he was the son-in-law of the old Curie couple, so he adopted the double surname, Joliot-Curie. His scientific achievements are worthy of being the successor to the old Curie couple, and he developed atomic physics. He is a banner of progressive scientists in the world and the chairman of the World Federation of Scientific Workers. As a scientist alone, his name can be included in the ranks of the world's cultural giants, and he has made outstanding contributions to human culture.

But at the same time, he is also a banner of the world peace movement. He has been leading the world peace movement since 1949. The World Peace Council was established at the World Peace Congress in Warsaw in November 1950, and he was elected as chairman, a position he has held until now. His contribution to the peace movement is no less than his contribution to scientific research.

The peace movement has developed greatly in the past decade. It initially started as a social activity by a group of progressive or enlightened people in Europe, such as scientists, literary artists, and social activists, and has now developed into a powerful anti-war movement involving people from all over the world, including Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The struggles against colonialism and for national independence that have sprung up in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have merged with the world peace movement. People with foresight have realized that colonialism is the root of war, and therefore the opposition to colonialism and the maintenance of the peace movement are inseparable. This merger has made the banner of the peace movement even clearer, thus providing a more solid foundation, enabling the World Peace Council to serve as the mouthpiece of peace-loving people all over the world. Such development is certainly a logical and natural trend, but it should also be attributed to the correct leadership of Chairman Joliot-Curie. As far as I know, he has always supported the anti-colonial movement. He is an excellent French Communist Party member, and stating this alone is enough to explain everything. It is impossible to imagine a Communist Party member not opposing colonialism. I remember that after the Asia-Pacific Peace Conference in 1952, I talked with him about this issue on one occasion. I said that we believe that the peace movement should raise the banner of anti-colonialism in order to win over the broad masses of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; he expressed his complete agreement. This further shows that his views are very different from those of some Western friends.

Because Joliot-Curie was an atomic physicist, he felt particularly sorry about the use of atomic energy as a weapon of mass destruction. In the peace movement, he devoted himself particularly to opposing the use of atomic and nuclear weapons. He emphasized this issue in his reports at every conference; his report at the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation in July this year was the same. His call is now being echoed by people all over the world. The Soviet Union has taken the initiative to stop nuclear weapon tests; the thunderous roar demanding that the United States and Britain follow the Soviet Union's example and permanently ban atomic and nuclear weapons has spread throughout the world.

Professor Joliot-Curie's brilliant life has been an effort to do the best, and he can truly be said to have "made contributions to mankind." His name will undoubtedly live in people's hearts forever. Because he engaged in atomic energy research and was in constant contact with radioactive materials, especially in the early years when protective equipment was not perfect enough, his health was affected. His wife was in the same profession as him and also suffered damage to her health for the same reason, passing away five years earlier. Professor Joliot-Curie has now passed away, and I cannot help but feel sad for the loss of an outstanding leader of scientific research and the peace movement. However, while I am saddened, I cannot help but feel a noble and heroic image of self-sacrifice in Professor Joliot-Curie's style. There is no doubt that Professor Joliot-Curie will be immortal in the history of human culture.

His health was affected ten years ago. Since I joined the peace movement in 1949, I have heard that his health did not allow him to travel long distances, especially by plane. However, he attended almost every peace conference. Of course, he could only travel by train or car. His participation in this conference would be a great encouragement. He took the risk to his health to attend the meeting, which should be said to be a heroic act of dedication. Therefore, everyone who attended the meeting respected him and cared for him. His attitude was indeed amiable and could not help but give rise to respect. His actions and speech were calm and unhurried. His reports were persuasive and logically strong, and of course, they were by no means dry or cold sermons. Listening to his report was like being in the classroom of a brilliant teacher, giving people the pleasure of "listening to your words is better than reading books for ten years."

In order to hold the Stockholm Conference in July, he visited the Soviet Union in June and exchanged views with Soviet comrades. As far as we know, he advocated further strengthening the peace movement and expanding the foundation of the movement. This may have been his last long journey before his death. Before the conference was held, we had expected him to attend in person, but he finally could not attend due to health reasons, but a report he personally wrote was read at the conference, providing a solid foundation for the various discussions of the conference and promoting the success of the Stockholm Conference. Based on these facts, a conclusion can be drawn: Professor Joliot-Curie can truly be said to have dedicated his life to the peace movement.

I have participated in the peace movement for a full ten years, and I have met many international friends and made many respectable people. But I want to frankly say that among these many respectable peace comrades, the two who made me feel the closest and most convinced are Professor Joliot-Curie and Comrade Fadeyev. The two of them left the deepest impression on me, and the influence was also the deepest. The personalities of the two of them are not very different: one is a scientist, the other is a writer; one is amiable and calm, the other is upright and enthusiastic. However, they also have many things in common, the most important of which is that they are both responsible and innocent.

I had very little contact with their private lives, even no contact at all, but their sincerity to people could be seen in every word and deed. Especially in some unintentional actions that were occasionally revealed, it could be seen that they had not lost their childlike innocence. Here I would like to mention two small things about them.

Joliot-Curie liked to fish. At a panel meeting of a peace conference, he took out a photo for us to see. It was a photo of him catching a sea fish that was about three feet long. He held it with his left hand hanging down by his thigh, holding the fishing rod in his right hand, with a knowing smile on his face. This smile was still on his face when he showed the photo, although his left hand was no longer holding a big fish but a photo, and his right hand was no longer holding a fishing rod but a pencil.

About Fadeyev, as soon as I think of him, his posture in that small incident will appear before my eyes. That was in March 1953. I followed Premier Zhou and other comrades to Moscow to attend Stalin's funeral. I lived in the Soviet Hotel. One night, Comrade Fadeyev came to visit me. He had just come out of the hospital not long ago because he had liver disease. Of course, we were very happy to see each other, and I asked about his health. He said that he had basically recovered, but there was one regret. As he spoke, he smiled and made a circle with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand, raised it to his mouth, and then humorously said: The doctor does not allow this happiness. I naturally understood and smiled and said: It is also very good not to drink alcohol. But he said: Isn't it a bitter thing not to be able to "cheers" (this word was said in Chinese) when meeting a good friend? After saying that, he laughed heartily in his hearty voice. But I want to explain here: Comrade Fadeyev is not an alcoholic. His liver disease seems to have been aggravated during his experience in the steel factory. In order to write a novel about the life of workers, he lived in a steel factory for a year.

I think these two small things are enough to show the innocence of these two peace comrades. They can have outstanding achievements in scientific research, literary creation, and social activities. I am afraid that this excellent quality should be a factor. The ancients said: "Great people do not lose their childlike innocence." I think this is true. Of course, they are people who can distinguish between enemies and friends. They are innocent children to friends, but they are strong warriors to enemies. This can also be said to be a unity of contradictions.

Two respectable and dear friends have died, and I miss them. But I believe that they will not have much regret, because they have made good use of their lives. I cannot understand why Comrade Fadeyev had to commit suicide; perhaps his sense of responsibility was too strong, and he felt that he was terminally ill and could not help, so he took the means of "not complete or none"?

Regarding Joliot-Curie's life, it was not so free in France. Although he was a good son of the French people, the French ruling class continued to persecute him. A few years ago, he was dismissed from the research position he held in the state organs, and for a period of time, some people even attempted to violently deprive him of his life. I remember that at the Vienna World Peace Congress in the winter of 1952, he once told us that he was willing to come to China with his wife and a part of his assistants to help us carry out the research on the peaceful use of atomic energy. Of course, we were very welcome. But because of various reasons, he finally did not come. Joliot-Curie repeatedly told us that he loved China. It is a pity that we Chinese people have lost such a sincere friend.

Dear Comrades Joliot-Curie and Fadeyev, you have fulfilled your due responsibilities, please rest in peace. I believe that the progressive scientists, writers, and social activists of all countries in the world will work hard to inherit the tasks you have left behind. We Chinese people must learn from your good examples; under the leadership of our party, the productive forces that have been completely liberated, we must try our best to make it work endlessly; we must go all out, give full play to our high enthusiasm and creativity, and make continuous contributions to the noble cause of improving human culture and safeguarding world peace.

Your brilliant examples show us:
Science and literature should thoroughly and unreservedly serve the people and serve peace!
The forces of peace will surely win the final and comprehensive victory, and forever eliminate colonialism and wars of aggression!

　　献身精神的榜样
　　郭沫若
    约里奥—居里教授是世界知名的杰出的原子能物理学家，他本姓约里奥，是老居里夫妇的女婿，所以采取了复姓，叫约里奥—居里。他在科学上的成就，不愧是老居里夫妇的继承者，他把原子能物理学发展了。他是世界进步科学家的一面旗帜，是世界科学联合会的主席。单单作为科学家，他的名字就可以列入世界文化巨人的行列的，他对于人类文化是作出了卓越的贡献。
    但他同时又是世界和平运动的一面旗帜，自从1949年以来他一直领导着世界和平运动。1950年11月在华沙世界保卫和平大会上成立了世界和平理事会，他被选为主席，一直担任到现在。他对于和平运动上的贡献是不亚于他在科学研究上的贡献的。
    十年来和平运动有了很大的发展。它起初主要是由欧洲一部分进步的或开明的人士，科学家、文学艺术家、社会活动家等所发起的社会活动，现在已经发展成为包括亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等世界各国人民的强有力的反战运动了。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等国风起云涌的反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争已经和世界和平运动合流，有远见的人士大家都认识到殖民主义是战争的根源，因而反对殖民主义和维护和平运动是分不开来的。这一合流使和平运动的旗帜更加鲜明了，因而也就有了更雄厚的基础，使世界和平理事会能够做到全世界爱好和平人民的喉舌。这样的发展固然是合乎逻辑性的自然趋势，但也应该归功于约里奥—居里主席的正确领导。据我所了解，他一向是支持反殖民主义运动的。他是一位优秀的法国共产党员，单只提出这一点就足够说明一切了。共产党员而不反对殖民主义，那是不可能想像的事。记得在1952年的亚太和会后，在一个机会上我和他谈过这个问题。我说，我们认为和平运动应该打出反殖民主义的旗帜，以争取亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大人民；他表示完全同意。这更表明，他的见解和某些西方朋友的见解是大有不同的。
    由于约里奥—居里是原子能物理学家，他对于把原子能作为大量毁灭性武器而使用是特别感到遗憾的。在和平运动中他特别致力于反对原子武器核武器的使用。在每次大会上，在他的报告中都要强调这个问题；今年7月在斯德哥尔摩裁军和国际合作大会上，他的报告的内容也是同样。他的呼声在今天是得到全世界人民的响应了。苏联已主动地停止了核武器试验；要求美国英国效法苏联的榜样并永远禁止原子武器核武器的雷霆般的怒吼，已遍及于全世界。
    约里奥—居里教授光辉的一生是作了至善的努力的，他真可以说是“功在人类”。他的名字毫无疑问将永远活在人们的心里。他因为从事原子能研究，由于经常和放射性物质接触，特别是在前些年辰防护设备还不够完善，因而他的健康受了影响。他的夫人和他是同一专业，也因同样的理由而损害了健康，在五年前早一步去世了。约里奥—居里教授今天又相继去世，我禁制不住要为科学研究和和平运动失掉了一位卓越的领导者而悲痛，然而我在悲痛的同时却不能不在约里奥—居里教授的风格中体会到一个崇高的勇于自我牺牲的英雄形象。毫无疑问，约里奥—居里教授在人类文化史上是会永垂不朽的。
    他的健康受到影响已经是十年以前的事了。我自1949年参加和平运动以来，就听说他的健康不允许他作长途旅行，特别是坐飞机。然而每次和平会议，他差不多都是参加了的。当然，他只能够坐火车或者汽车。这次会议一得到他的参加，便会受到巨大的鼓舞。他那样冒着健康上的危险而参加会议，应该说也就是表现着献身精神的悲壮的行为。因而凡是予会的人都是尊敬他而且爱护他的。他的态度也的确令人感觉到和蔼可亲而又不能不生出敬重的念头。他的行动和谈吐都是雍容不迫。他的报告是富有说服力的、逻辑性很强，当然也决不是干巴巴的或者冷冰冰的说教。听他的报告就如在上高明老师的课堂，令人具有“听君一席话胜读十年书”的快感。
    为了7月斯德哥尔摩大会的举行，在6月间他曾经去访问过苏联，和苏联同志们交换意见。据我们所知道的情形，他是主张进一步加强和平运动，扩大运动的基础的。这可能是他生前最后一次的长途旅行了。在大会召开前，我们曾经期待着他会亲自出席，但他终于因为健康的关系没有可能到会，但他亲自执笔的一篇报告是在大会上宣读了，为大会的各项讨论提供了坚实的基础，促进了斯德哥尔摩大会的成功。根据这些事实可以下出一个结论：约里奥—居里教授之于和平运动真可以说是“生死以之”的。
    我参加和平运动已经整整有十年的历史，我认识了不少的国际朋友，接交了不少的可尊敬的人。但我要坦率地说：在这许许多多的可尊敬的和平战友中，使我感觉着最可亲近而心悦诚服的，要算是约里奥—居里教授和法捷耶夫同志两位。他们两位给我的印象最深，而且影响也最深。他们两位的性格是不大相同的：一位是科学家，一位是作家；一位和蔼而冷静，一位刚直而热情。然而他们也有不少共同之点，最主要的便是同样负责而天真。
    我和他们的私生活接触得很少，甚至可以说毫无接触，但他们对人的真率是在一言一动中可以看得出来的。特别在偶尔表现出的一些不经意的举动里面，可以看出他们都没有失掉赤子之心。我在这里就想举出关于他们的两件小事。
    约里奥—居里是喜欢钓鱼的。在有一次和平大会的小组会上他拿出一张照片给我们看，那是他钓到了一匹大约有三尺多长的海鱼，他用左手提着垂在大腿边，右手拿着钓竿，脸上露出会心的微笑。这微笑在他显示照片当时的脸上也还保留着的，虽然他左手拿的不再是大鱼而是照片，右手拿的不再是钓竿而是铅笔了。
    关于法捷耶夫的一件小事，我只要一想起他，他在那件小事中的姿态就要浮在我眼前。那是1953年3月的事。我跟着周总理和其他同志到莫斯科去参加斯大林的葬仪。我住在苏维埃旅馆。有一天晚上法捷耶夫同志来访问我，他是才从医院出来不久的，因为他得了肝病。我们见了面当然很高兴，我便问到他的健康。他说基本上是恢复了，但有件遗憾的事。他说着带着笑容，把右手的拇指和食指扣成一个圈，对着嘴举了一下，然后幽默地说：这个快乐大夫不允许了。我自然是会意的，便也笑着说：不喝酒也很好。他却说：碰到好朋友不能
  “干杯”（这个辞是用中国话说的）不是件苦事吗？说罢用他爽朗的声音哈哈大笑。但我在这里要说明一下：法捷耶夫同志并不是汹酒之徒，他的肝病似乎是在钢铁工厂体验生活中加重的，他为了要写一部关于工人生活的小说，曾经在一座钢铁工厂里住了一年。
    这两件小事，我认为，很足以表明这两位和平战友的天真。他们在科学研究中，在文艺创作中，在社会活动中都能够有特出的成就，这种优良的品质怕应该是一个因素。古人说：
  “大人者不失其赤子之心”，我认为这话是真确的。当然，他们是能够分清敌友的人，对于朋友是天真的赤子，而对于敌人却是坚强的战士。这也可以说是一种矛盾的同一性吧。
    两位可尊敬、可亲爱的朋友都死了，我怀念他们。但我相信，他们不会有多大的遗憾，因为他们把他们的一生都作了很好的利用。法捷耶夫同志为什么一定要自杀，这是我所不能理解的事；或许是他责任心过强，感觉到病入膏肓、无济于事，便采取了“不全则无”的手段的吧？
    关于约里奥—居里的生活，在法国是并不那么自由的。尽管他是法国人民的一位优良的儿子，然而法国的统治阶层却不断给以迫害，在几年前解除了他的在国家机关中所担任的研究职务，而且有一个时期还有人企图用暴力来剥夺他的生命。记得是在1952年冬维也纳的世界和平人民大会上，他曾经向我们表示：他愿意和他夫人一道，并带着一部分助手，到中国来帮助我们展开和平利用原子能的研究。我们当然是很欢迎的。但因为种种关系，他终于没有来。约里奥—居里屡次对我们说，他是热爱中国的。我们中国人民失掉了这样一位真诚的友人，实在是一件遗憾的事。
    亲爱的约里奥—居里同志和法捷耶夫同志，你们是尽了自己应尽的责任，你们就请安息吧。你们所遗留下来的任务，我相信世界各国进步的科学家、作家、社会活动家是会努力继承起来的。我们中国人民一定要学习你们的好的榜样；在我们党的领导下已经彻底解放了的生产力，我们一定要尽量地无止境地使它发生作用；我们一定要鼓足干劲，发挥高度的积极性和创造性，为提高人类文化和保卫世界和平的崇高事业，作出不断的贡献。
    你们的光辉的榜样向我们昭示着：
    科学和文艺应该彻底地毫无保留地为人民服务，为和平服务！
    和平力量一定能够获得最后的全面的胜利，永远消灭殖民主义和侵略战争！　　　　1958年8月16日
