    Everyone Should Be Versatile

    Currently, many "all-rounders" who have mastered multiple technologies have emerged in industrial and mining enterprises and commerce. In agricultural cooperatives, there have also appeared "all-purpose people" who understand both agricultural and industrial technologies. The emergence of these new people has powerfully promoted the development of various productions. We need more of these versatile "all-purpose people."

    However, some people believe that it is relatively easy to become an "all-rounder" in industry, agriculture, and commerce, as it is merely a matter of practicing more skills. They think it is difficult for people engaged in literature and art, propaganda, and other ideological work to become "all-rounders." Of course, it would be difficult and unnecessary to ask literary and art workers to learn science and technology. However, within the scope of literature and art, is it possible to learn more skills? The answer is definitely yes, and it is also necessary. If a writer goes deep into reality and the objective reality requires him to write some features, must he necessarily write poetry or novels? Those who hold this view are nothing more than mystics of literature and art. The fact that the members of the cultural teams of the Xilin Gol League and the Zhaowuda League in Inner Mongolia, who are featured in today's newspaper, can all sing, dance, perform, and write fully illustrates this point.

    All skills are acquired through practice. "All-rounders" and "all-purpose people" are not mysterious things. With diligent study and hard practice, any technical peak can be climbed, let alone certain skills. The key issue of whether one can become an "all-rounder" or "all-purpose person" does not lie in which profession you belong to, but in whether your mind is liberated and whether you dare to think and dare to do.

### 人人要多才多艺

    人人要多才多艺
    现在在工矿企业、商业中涌现了不少掌握多种技术的“多面手”，农业社里也出现了既懂农业技术，又懂工业技术的“万能人”。这些新人的涌现，有力地推动了各项生产的发展。我们需要更多的这样的多才多艺的“万能人”。
    但是，有人认为在工农商业方面，学成“多面手”比较容易，不过是多练几门手艺而已，像做文艺、宣传等搞思想工作的人练成
  “多面手”就困难了。当然，要叫文艺工作者去学会科学技术，这是困难的，也是不必要的。但是，在文学艺术范围内，是不是也可以多学会几样呢？肯定是可以的，而且也是必需的。一个作家深入实际，如果客观现实需要他写些特写，他难道一定非写诗、小说不可吗？有这种看法的人，不过是一个文艺神秘论者罢了。今天本报发表的内蒙古锡林郭勒盟和昭乌达盟文化队队员都能歌能舞、能演能写的事实，就充分地说明了这一点。
    各种本领都是练就的。“多面手”、“万能人”都不是什么神秘的东西。勤学苦练，任何技术高峰都可以攀登上去，何况某些技艺呢。能不能成为“多面手”“万能人”的关键问题绝不在于你属于哪行哪业，而是在于思想是否解放，敢不敢想，敢不敢干。
