　　Accelerate the Pace and Organize a Great Leap Forward in Bearing Production
　　Summary of the *Dazhong Daily* Editorial, August 20th

　　Thirteen counties (cities) including Gaotang, Linyi, and Weifang in Shandong Province have achieved roller bearing implementation for major agricultural tools ahead of schedule. Their common experience is: achieving bearing implementation is not mysterious and does not require a lot of time. As long as the leadership grasps it firmly, closely, and specifically, fully mobilizes the masses, starts with indigenous methods first, advances both casting and forging, uses the correct methods, and prepares sufficient tools and materials, roller bearing implementation can be basically achieved in seven, eight, or ten days.

　　However, the development of the roller bearing implementation movement is currently very uneven. According to statistics as of August 17th, twenty-four counties across the province produced more than 10,000 sets of bearings, sixteen counties produced between 5,000 and 10,000 sets, forty counties produced between 1,000 and 5,000 sets, and twenty-three counties produced less than 1,000 sets. Why do some counties produce more than 100,000 sets of roller bearings, while others produce less than 1,000 sets, or even less than a few dozen? This does not depend on the industrial base or other conditions; it is mainly a leadership issue. If the leadership is determined, grasps it tightly and specifically, and uses the correct methods, progress is fast. If the leadership is not determined and the methods are incorrect, progress is slow. Now, the conditions for immediately organizing a great leap forward in roller bearing production are ripe throughout the province. These conditions are: First, the mass movement to vigorously develop bearings has initially taken shape. Examples of achieving bearing implementation, improving labor efficiency, and liberating the labor force have greatly encouraged cadres and the masses to accelerate bearing implementation. Second, roller bearing factories have been established in every township and commune across the province, and production equipment has been initially established. More than 26,000 bearing factories have been built across the province, with an average of more than ten bearing factories per township. A large number of locally made tools are already available. Third, leaders at all levels have gained experience in mobilizing the masses to engage in the bearing implementation movement and have found ways to start with indigenous methods first. Currently, we must do everything possible to rush production and organize a high tide in roller bearing production. There are only eleven days left until the end of August, and we must strive to achieve a daily output of 1 to 2 million sets of bearings throughout the province, with a daily output of 10,000 to 20,000 sets in general counties, to resolutely ensure the realization of the provincial party committee's goal of achieving bearing implementation for all rotating tools throughout the province before the end of August.

　　In order to achieve the above goals, it is necessary to immediately check the implementation of the plan, focus on grasping the daily output, and organize a great leap forward in bearing production. Each county should carefully calculate the number of tools that need to be fitted with bearings, the potential of production equipment, and the time required to achieve bearing implementation. Based on the possible conditions and subjective efforts, propose clear plans and daily output targets for the number of roller bearings, and use this to organize production and specifically arrange labor, tools, and materials. Where there is a shortage of production tools, rush to produce tools; where there is a shortage of materials, mobilize the masses to collect scrap iron and steel, use local materials, and rely on their own efforts; where the arrangement of labor is unreasonable, quickly improve labor organization and properly arrange labor. It is necessary to calculate the overall benefits of reforming agricultural tools, improving work efficiency, and promoting a leap forward in production, and dispel concerns about bearing implementation affecting pest control and topdressing. Grasp the indicators for comprehensively organizing a great leap forward in bearing production, carry out evaluation and inspection, launch competitions, boost the revolutionary drive of cadres and the masses, and change backwardness.

　　It is necessary to adhere to fully mobilizing the masses, starting with indigenous methods first, encouraging creation and invention, and carrying out a technological innovation movement in bearing production. There are many creations and inventions in bearing production in various places, which should be discovered, identified, and vigorously promoted at any time. The province recently held a forum for technical workers from more than a dozen counties, which focused on the existing experience in bearing production in various places, and believed that both red furnace forging and sand casting methods must be adopted simultaneously to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. There are now roughly four methods for producing bearing inner and outer rings, all of which can be promoted: one is ductile iron, which is of higher quality, but the raw material magnesium is difficult to obtain, and the production volume is limited; one is casting martensitic steel, also called "horse iron," which requires higher production technology and more time, generally requiring 30 to 40 hours of tempering, and can be promoted in places with conditions; one is forging, which can be produced in large quantities by organizing red furnace blacksmiths; and one is ordinary pig iron casting, which not only allows for local materials, easy casting, simple and easy to learn technology, large production volume, and fast speed, but also can ensure quality and meet the needs of general low-speed agricultural tools. Some use gray pig iron, some use white pig iron, and some use half gray pig iron and half white pig iron, or mix some silicon-manganese iron; some places use white pig iron to cast inner and outer rings in one go, without turning, even for heavy-duty iron wheel carts, as long as the thickness is increased, it can still bear the pressure of heavy loads. It seems that the two methods of red furnace forging and pig iron casting should be massively promoted, which can greatly accelerate bearing implementation. There are also roughly three methods for producing ball bearings, all of which can be promoted: one is casting large-sized pellets with pig iron, with a daily output of 4,000 pellets per red furnace in the plains; one is machine-made ball bearings, with Teng County creating a stamping press that produces 6,000 pellets per day. The manufacture of this tool is very simple, and the county produced 240 of these machines in one day and night; one is a muffle furnace and hammer, which are simple tools suitable for everyone to use. One person can make 100 to 200 pellets a day. Government agencies, schools, women, and children can all make ball bearings. A county with thousands of muffle furnaces can produce ball bearings needed for 10,000 sets of bearings a day.

　　It is necessary to advocate communist collaboration, adopt large-scale production methods, and organize assembly line operations. Counties, townships, and communes should cooperate and divide labor. In addition to continuing to rush to produce tools and equipment for township and commune bearing factories, counties and large market towns should also organize sand casting to produce large-scale roller bearings for large carts in large quantities. Townships and communes should mainly use red furnaces, simple lathes, and muffle furnaces to produce small roller bearings in large quantities. Township and commune bearing factories should promote the experience of Pingyuan, adopt large-scale production methods, concentrate production, and conduct assembly line operations. A township or a large commune should build a bearing factory, set up red furnaces, lathes, ball bearings, and install several workshops to carry out assembly line production with different types of work. This is conducive to strengthening leadership, exchanging experiences, propaganda and mobilization, carrying out competitions, organizing shock work, and improving work efficiency. It also facilitates the mutual exchange of information between communes, learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, and organizing large-scale production collaboration. At the same time, urban support for rural areas and advanced units supporting backward units should also be promoted. Linyi County, after achieving bearing implementation, proposed to work hard for another ten days and nights to rush to produce 400,000 sets of bearings to support fraternal counties. This spirit is very good, and other counties should learn from the county.

　　加快步伐组织轴承生产大跃进
    大众日报八月二十日社论摘要
    山东高唐、临沂、潍坊等十三个县（市）提前实现了主要农具滚珠轴承化。他们的共同经验是：实现轴承化并不神秘，并不要花很多时间，只要领导抓得狠，抓得紧，抓得具体，放手发动群众，土法先上马，浇铸与锻打并进，方法对头，工具料物准备充分，在七、八天或十多天就可以基本实现滚珠轴承化。
    但是，目前滚珠轴承化运动的发展很不平衡，截至本月17日统计，全省生产轴承万套以上的有二十四个县，万套到五千套的有十六个县，五千到一千套的有四十个县，还有二十三个县仅产一千套以下。为什么有些县生产滚珠轴承达十万套以上，有些县生产滚珠轴承不到一千套，甚至不到几十套呢？这并不决定于工业基础和其他条件，主要的是领导问题，领导决心大，抓得紧，抓得具体，方法对头，就快；领导无决心，方法不对头，就慢。现在在全省范围内立即组织一个滚珠轴承生产大跃进的条件已经成熟了，这些条件是：一、大办轴承已初步形成了群众性的运动，实现轴承化，提高劳动效率，解放劳动力的实例，大大鼓舞了干部、群众加速轴承化的干劲；二、全省乡乡社社都建立了滚珠轴承厂，生产设备已初具规模，全省已建成二万六千多个轴承厂，一个乡平均就有十多个轴承厂，已经有了大量的土造工具；三、各级领导已取得了发动群众搞轴承化运动的经验，摸到了土法先上马的门路。当前我们要想尽一切办法突击生产，组织滚珠轴承生产高潮。现在离8月底只有十一天了，必须努力争取全省日产轴承一百至二百万套，一般县日产一万至两万套，坚决保证实现省委提出的8月底前实现全省运转工具轴承化的奋斗目标。
    为了实现上述奋斗目标，要立即检查计划执行情况，突出地抓日产量，组织轴承生产大跃进。各县要仔细地盘算一下需要安装轴承工具的数量，生产设备的潜力和实现轴承化需要的时间，根据条件可能加上主观努力，提出明确的计划与日产滚珠轴承数量指标，以此来组织生产，具体安排劳力、工具料物。生产工具不足的地方要突击赶制工具；料物不足的地方，要发动群众筹集废钢铁，就地取材，自力更生；劳力安排不合理的地方，要迅速地改善劳动组织，妥善安排劳力，要算改革农具，提高工效，促进生产跃进的大账，打破搞轴承化影响治虫、追肥的顾虑。抓住全面组织轴承生产大跃进的指标，开展评比检查，发动竞赛，鼓足干部群众的革命干劲，改变落后。
    要坚持放手发动群众，土法先上马，鼓励创造发明，开展轴承生产技术革新运动。各地生产轴承的创造发明很多，应当随时发现随时鉴定，大力推广。省最近召开了十多个县技术工人座谈会，集中了现有各地生产轴承的经验，认为必须采取红炉锻打与翻砂浇铸两种方法同时并进，才能做到多快好省。现在生产轴承内外圈大体有四种办法，均可推广：一种是球墨铸铁，质量较高，但镁的原材料困难，生产量有限；一种是浇铸麻钢，也叫马铁，生产技术较高，需要较多时间，一般焖火要三四十个小时，有条件的地方可以推广；一种是锻打，组织红炉铁匠可以大量地生产；一种是普通的生铁浇铸，这个办法不仅可以就地取材，容易浇铸，技术简单易学，生产量大，速度快，而且可以保证质量，适应一般低速农具需要。有的用灰生铁，有的用白生铁，有的用灰白生铁各半，或掺一些矽锰铁；有些地方采用白生铁浇铸内外圈一遍成功，不要车削，就是载重大的铁轮大车，只要增加厚度，同样地可以担负大车载重的压力。看来红炉锻打与生铁浇铸两个办法应大量推广，可以大大加速轴承化。滚珠的生产也大体有三种办法，均可推广：一种是生铁浇铸大型珠粒，平原一盘红炉浇铸日产四千粒；一种是机器制造滚珠，滕县创造冲压式压力机，日产六千粒，这种工具制造很简单，该县一昼夜生产了这种机器二百四十部；一种是焖子、锤子，工具简单，适合人人动手，一个人一天可打一、二百粒，机关、学校、妇女、儿童都可以打滚珠，一个县有几千个焖子就可日产万套轴承所需的滚珠。
    要提倡共产主义大协作，采取大生产方式，组织流水作业。县、乡、社要分工协作，县和大集镇除应继续突击赶制生产滚珠轴承的工具装备乡社轴承厂外，还应组织翻砂，大量地生产大型大车滚珠轴承。乡、社应以红炉、简易车床、焖子为主体，大量地生产小型的滚珠轴承。乡、社轴承厂应推广平原经验，采取大生产方式，集中生产，流水作业，一个乡或一个大社建一个轴承厂，设上红炉、旋床、滚珠，安装几个车间，分别工种进行流水作业生产，这样便于加强领导，交流经验，宣传鼓动，开展竞赛，组织突击，提高工效；便于社与社之间互通有无，取长补短，组织生产大协作。同时，还应提倡城市支援农村，先进的单位支援落后的单位。临沂县在实现了轴承化以后，提出要再苦干十昼夜，赶制四十万套轴承，支援兄弟县的精神，是很好的，其他县应向该县学习。
