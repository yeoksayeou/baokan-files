Red Songs Resound Throughout the Green Homeland
　　——At the Evening Party in Taizhouwu Village
　　Su Fang
　　Tonight is the club's opening day. People from Taizhouwu Village, Yongfengtun Township, are all heading here with excitement.
　　Inside, two electric lights shine brightly; on the wall facing the door is a striking slogan: Cross the Yellow River, Surpass the Yangtze; Learn Culture, Eradicate Illiteracy; Let Red Songs Resound Throughout the Green Homeland. Under the illumination of the lights, every word gleams. People are gathered in groups of twos and threes, reading magazines, reading newspapers....
　　Outside, in the courtyard, beside the field ridges, by the corners of the walls, songs are breaking out everywhere, and the bamboo clappers used for quick storytelling are also being struck with a rhythmic "ba-da, ba-da" sound. These are the actors who will be performing in tonight's cultural program, intensifying their practice.
　　Speaking of cultural performances, this is nothing new to the people of Taizhouwu. As early as liberation, a theatrical troupe was established in the village, performing large-scale plays such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Yiguandao," and "The Volunteer Army's Fiancée." After the establishment of the cooperative, the troupe developed even further, establishing a writing group, an interviewing group, and a performance group, and the number of actors also increased. They not only perform existing plays, but also write and perform their own plays based on the new people and new events in the village. Recently, because production is busy, large-scale plays are not performed much, but small-scale performances have never been interrupted.
　　People are very willing to participate in cultural evenings, because everyone deeply realizes that watching interesting cultural programs can not only reduce fatigue after work, but also be educational. There are many vivid examples: In 1952, an old lady prevented her son from joining the Volunteer Army. After watching "The Volunteer Army's Fiancée," she understood the principle of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country. She changed, and encouraged her son to sign up for the army. In the past, some male commune members were dissatisfied with equal pay for equal work for female commune members. After performing the play "Female Commune Members" this Spring Festival, this outdated thinking was eliminated. ... Now, people are watching those actors with eager eyes. Look, how enthusiastically they are practicing, speaking and singing, and also correcting each other's postures and expressions. They all want to perform wonderfully, because tonight's evening has a special significance - a group of students who are about to graduate from Beijing Normal University have just come here to participate in labor training, and tonight is a joint celebration for new and old commune members!
　　The evening party began, and the production team leader was speaking loudly in the courtyard. This fifty-two-year-old former farmhand, used to be a well-known "stone stake," silent and unmoving. After liberation, he became a lively and vigorous person. His speech was short and clear, expressing welcome to the new commune members, and encouraging all commune members to work harder to do a good job in drought resistance, flood prevention, topdressing, hoeing, and other tasks. Their evening parties often take this approach: arranging the current central tasks and performing programs at the same time.
　　Then, the actors took the stage. People immediately began to talk and laugh with great interest. A male student sang a segment of single-string storytelling, satirizing a backward, stubborn person. The interesting lyrics, interesting tunes, and interesting expressions amused the people. Everyone laughed heartily. Several young people, while laughing, began to discuss in low voices: "How can this person be so backward?" "Isn't that right? He really deserves severe criticism." From these words, it can be seen that in their young and ardent hearts, they cannot tolerate such outdated figures.
　　The female students sang many beautiful songs, such as "Looking at the Sweetheart" and "Husband and Wife Teasing." Then, Kong Qingsheng, an old commune member who is good at telling quick stories, came out to count his newly compiled "Summer Hygiene." The words were not yet familiar, and he stuttered and could not continue speaking. People laughed again. After the laughter subsided, everyone began to comfort him. One person said, "Don't worry, don't tremble, take your time," and another said, "If you really can't remember, then tell an old segment." With everyone's encouragement, Kong Qingsheng finally successfully told a segment of "Liberating Taiwan." The summer night after the rain is fresh and clear, and people's hearts are as clean and pure as it is, harmonious and without barriers!
　　The new commune members sang well, and the old commune members sang equally well. Conductor Zhang Wanling led the cooperative's choir to sing. This choir is truly well-organized: there are young men and women, children, and old people in their fifties and sixties. The songs of the Great Leap Forward resounded in all directions, and the elderly were also excited and sang like young people. They not only learned many new songs, but also composed their own songs praising the new society to sing. The old men's choir was originally going to perform separately, but just after the rain, the roads were muddy and difficult to walk, and they were blocked by others and did not come, so they temporarily mixed together to sing. The elderly sang, the young people sang, and the children also sang along. They sang "Socialism is Good" and "Work, Work, Work" loudly with proud expressions. People echoed and sang together. The majestic singing shook the sleeping fields and subdued the noisy croaking frogs. Just as the slogan in the house said: Red Songs Resound Throughout the Green Homeland!

　　红色歌声响遍绿色家乡
　　——在太舟坞村的晚会上
　　苏方
    今晚是俱乐部开放的日子。永丰屯乡太舟坞村的人们，都兴冲冲地朝这儿走来。
    室内，两盏电灯照得明晃晃的；朝门的墙上贴着一张引人注目的标语：跨黄河，越长江；学文化，扫文盲；红色的歌声响遍绿色的家乡。在灯光照耀下，每一个字都闪闪发光。人们，三三五五地聚在一起，在读杂志，在看报……。
    室外，院子里，田坎旁，墙角边，到处歌声四起，数快板用的竹板也打得吧哒吧哒直响，那是今晚要表演文娱节目的演员们，在加紧练习。
    说起文娱表演，这对太舟坞的人已经不是什么新鲜事了。打一解放，村里就成立了剧团，演出过
  “白毛女”、“一贯道”、“志愿军的未婚妻”等大型剧目。合作社成立以后，剧团就更加发展，成立了编写组、采访组、演出组，演员人数也增多了。他们不但演现成的戏，而且还根据本村的新人新事，自编自演。最近，因为生产忙，大戏不大演了，但小型的演出仍然没有中断过。
    人们都很乐意参加文娱晚会，因为大家都深深体会到，看看有意思的文娱节目，不但可以减轻劳动后的疲劳，而且可以受到教育。活生生的例子有的是：1952年时，有一个老太太阻止儿子参加志愿军，看了“志愿军的未婚妻”以后，她懂得了抗美援朝、保家卫国的道理，她变了，鼓励儿子报名参军。过去，有些男社员不满意和女社员同工同酬，今年春节演出“女社员”这个戏后，这种陈旧的思想消除了。……现在，人们正以热切的眼光注视着那些演员们。瞧，他们练得多带劲，又说又唱，还互相纠正着姿态和表情。他们都想表演得精采些，因为今天的晚会有着特殊意义——北京师范大学有一批即将毕业的学生新来这里参加劳动锻炼，今晚是新老社员一块联欢哩！
    晚会开始了，生产队长在院子当中大声讲着话。这个五十二岁的老雇农，过去是有名的“石头桩子”，不声不响的。解放以后，却成了一个生龙活虎的人。他的讲话简短明了，向新社员表示欢迎，又鼓励全体社员要加把劲做好抗旱、防涝、追肥、锄地等工作。他们的晚会，常常是采取这种方式：布置当前中心工作和表演节目同时进行。
    接着，演员们上场了。人们立刻开始兴致勃勃地说了起来，笑了起来。一个男学生唱了一段单弦，是讽刺一个落后的死脑筋的。那有趣的词，有趣的声调和有趣的表情，把人们逗乐了。大家笑得前仰后合。几个年青人一面笑着，一面低低议论开了：“这人怎么这么落后？”“可不是吗？真得狠狠批评批评他。”从这些话里看得出来，他们年青火热的心中，是容受不下这样陈旧的人物的。
    女学生们唱了好些动听的歌，什么“瞧情郎”呀，“夫妻逗趣”呀。接着擅长说快板的老社员孔庆生出来数他新编的“夏季卫生”。词还不熟呢，他结结巴巴地老说不下去，人们又笑起来了。笑声一完，大家便劝慰起他来。这个说，“你别着急，别哆嗦，慢慢来吧”，那个说，“你实在记不住，就说一段老的吧”。在大家的鼓励下，孔庆生终于顺利地说了一段“解放台湾”。雨后的夏夜是清新爽朗的，人们的心也像它一样清净无尘，彼此融洽无间！
    新社员唱得好，老社员唱得同样好。指挥张万伶领着社里的合唱队唱了起来。这个合唱队真是阵容整齐：有青年男女，有小孩，还有五六十岁的老人。大跃进的歌声震响四方，老年人也振奋得像年青人一样欢唱起来。他们不但学了很多新歌，还自己编了赞扬新社会的歌来唱。老头合唱队本来要单独表演的，只是刚下过雨，道路泥泞不好走，被别人挡住了没有来，因此才临时大家混在一块唱。老年人唱，青年人唱，孩子们也随着唱，他们带着自豪的表情大声唱着“社会主义好”，唱着“干、干、干”。人们应和着一起唱了起来。雄壮的歌声震响了沉睡的田野，慑住了鼓噪的鸣蛙。正如屋里的标语所写的：红色的歌声响遍了绿色的家乡！
