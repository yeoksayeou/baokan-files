    Excellent!

    At present, a mass upsurge of running factories in universities has formed across the country, with both studying and labor advancing by leaps and bounds. Tsinghua University is a very good example. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, this university resolutely implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor and embarked on the road of running factories on a large scale. In just a short period, it mobilized the masses, started from scratch, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and self-reliantly built a large number of factories. These factories have now become joint bases for teaching, production, and scientific research throughout the university. The factoryization of the school has promoted a comprehensive leap forward in teaching and scientific research and has also brought about significant changes in people's thinking. Here, there are not only studying students, but also "student workers" who did not exist in the past.
    The emergence of this new atmosphere has been attacked by some "onlookers" and "opposition" gentlemen. They said: Running factories on a large scale in schools, and having college students become workers, is absurd; isn't this simply "abnormal"? Indeed, running factories on a large scale in schools is a pioneering undertaking in the history of education; it has never been seen in the history of education, either ancient or modern, in China or abroad. However, we say that what the bourgeoisie considers abnormal is precisely the norm of our socialist school education. We must use revolutionary action to change the thousands of years of accepting wrong as right in the shortest possible time. Our current education revolution is to oppose the bourgeoisie's "regulation" of being divorced from production and reality, and to break the old order that does not conform to the proletarian educational principles. This is not only not "abnormal," but a very good normality!
    Socialist education is to cultivate new types of laborers or new types of intellectuals. All universities should run factories, and all university students should be workers. This is the communist successor we want to cultivate, a new type of talent combining mental and physical labor. Tsinghua University and many other universities are running factories on a large scale, and students are working as workers, turning the formerly cold and quiet laboratories into places where machines roar day and night, and turning the past pale-faced scholars into dark-faced iron men. Isn't this a good illustration that the socialist school education system, on the one hand, makes our schools vibrant, and on the other hand, educates students to be healthy in both body and mind?
    Some people think that if schools run factories and students work as workers, what knowledge can they learn? However, when college students become workers, they can intimately understand what knowledge is and who has the most knowledge. In labor production, many technical problems in actual production are solved by relying on veteran workers. Some people once said, "If you let a worker be a professor, he will definitely hang on the blackboard." But in production practice, a welder welds a boiler, while teachers and students can only line up to pass tools, and cannot do anything else. They have no choice but to honestly admit that the workers are their teachers, and honestly learn to be workers themselves, until the workers praise them: "Workers are them, students are them, they are student workers!" This shows that practical knowledge is much more abundant and important than book knowledge.
    Not only that, in the process of running factories in schools, we can see that the vast number of students are educated in labor and learn the noble qualities of the working class in loving socialism. Because they labor themselves, they also love the fruits of their labor.
    This very good normal phenomenon is a huge gain and encouragement for all teachers and students who love socialism, and a head-on blow and a wake-up call for the "onlookers" and "opposition."

    好得很！

    目前全国高等学校已经形成一个大办工厂的群众性热潮，读书劳动双双跃进。清华大学就是很好的例子中的一个。这个学校在党委领导下，坚决贯彻了教育和生产劳动结合的方针，走学校大办工厂的道路，只在短短的一段时间里，发动群众，白手起家，土洋结合，自力更生地筹建起了大量的工厂。这些工厂现在已经成为全校教学、生产和科学研究的联合基地。学校工厂化，推动了教学和科学研究工作的全面大跃进，同时使人们的思想发生了显著变化。在这里，不仅有读书的学生，也出现了过去所没有过的“学生工人”。
    这个新气象的出现，却受到了某些“观潮派”和“反对派”先生们的攻击。他们说：学校里大办工厂，大学生去当工人，不像话，这不简直是“反常”吗？的确，学校大办工厂，这在教育史上是一个创举，古今中外的教育史上都还没有见过。不过，我们说，资产阶级所认为反常的，也正是我们社会主义学校教育的正常。几千年的习非成是，我们要在最短时期中用革命的行动把它改变过来。我们现在的教育革命就是要反掉资产阶级的脱离生产、脱离实际的“正规”，打破那些不符合无产阶级教育原则的旧秩序。这不仅不是“反常”，而且是好得很的正常！
    社会主义教育就是要培养新型的劳动者，或是新型的知识分子。所有大学要办工厂，所有大学生要做工人。这就是我们所要培养的共产主义接班人，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的新型的人材。清华大学和许多大学大办工厂，学生做工人，使过去冷冷清清的实验室，变成昼夜机器轰鸣，使过去的白面书生，变成黑脸铁汉，不是很好地说明了社会主义学校的教育制度，一方面把我们的学校办得生气勃勃，又一方面把学生教育得身心两健吗？
    有些人认为，学校办工厂，学生做工人，能有什么知识好学呢？可是，大学生做了工人，他们就能亲切地了解到什么叫知识，谁最有知识。在劳动生产中，许多生产实际中的技术问题，都是依靠老工人解决的。有的人曾说，“让工人去当教授，一定挂在黑板上”。但是在生产实践中，一个焊工焊锅炉，而教师学生只能列队传递工具，旁的什么事也插不上手。他们只好老老实实地承认工人是自己的老师，自己也老老实实地去学做工人，一直到工人赞扬他们“工人是他们，学生也是他们，他们是学生工人！”这就可以看到，实际知识要比书本知识多得多，而且更为重要。
    不仅如此，在学校办工厂的过程中，我们可以看到，广大学生受到劳动的教育，学习到工人阶级热爱社会主义的高尚品质，正因为自己劳动，也就热爱自己的劳动果实。
    这样好得很的正常现象，对一切热爱社会主义的师生来说是巨大的收获和鼓舞，对“观潮派”和“反对派”来说是当头棒喝、是警钟。
