Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Not wasting a single second, and ensuring that the steel and machinery industries achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest in the fourth quarter of this year, has become the battle cry of action throughout the country. The Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in twenty-one provinces have made grasping steel and machinery industries their top priority for the last four months of this year.

In recent days, up to today, the Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, Fujian, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Anhui, Jilin, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Zhejiang have successively convened provincial committee meetings, telephone conferences, or broadcast rallies to discuss and determine concrete and effective measures. They have decided to strive for advancement with the greatest revolutionary vigor, and to guarantee the over-fulfillment of the state-determined steel and machinery production tasks for this year.

To ensure that in the last four months of this year, the steel and machinery industries sing triumphant songs and achieve greater and more splendid victories, many provincial party secretaries are personally taking charge, supervising on the front lines, solving problems in a timely manner, and summarizing the experiences of steel production.

Since the whole people began running industry, tens of thousands of small-scale indigenous or foreign-style steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces have sprung up across the country this year. How to make these furnaces quickly and normally produce iron and steel, and how to solve technical production problems, has become crucial. To this end, many provinces are currently vigorously summarizing and promoting successful experiences, many provinces are vigorously developing steel experimental fields, and many provinces have also organized strong technical guidance teams for steel production. Shanxi, Guangdong, and other provinces have recently seen the emergence of many "steel medical teams," which tour around the provinces to treat the "diseases" of ironmaking and steelmaking furnaces. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently transferred one thousand technicians from relevant units to form six large teams, which have already departed for Hanzhong, Ankang, Shangluo, Yan'an, Yulin prefectures, and the Guanzhong area, to strengthen the technical guidance of newly built iron and steel industries in various places.

The workers on the steel front in various places are working day and night with soaring enthusiasm to over-fulfill the glorious tasks assigned by the state.

　　领导决心大　群众干劲足
    各地保证钢铁机械大丰收
    据新华社26日讯　不放过一分一秒的时间、让钢铁和机械工业在今年第四季度来一个空前大丰收，已经成为全国各地的战斗的行动口号；二十一个省的中共省委已经把抓钢铁、抓机械工业，当作今年最后四个月的头等重要任务。
    截至今天为止的最近几天之内，中共辽宁、江苏、山东、河北、河南、湖北、湖南、山西、福建、黑龙江、青海、安徽、吉林、云南、贵州、甘肃、浙江等省委，都先后召开了省委会议、电话会议或广播大会，讨论确定了切实有力的具体措施，决定以最大的革命干劲力争上游，保证超额完成今年国家确定的钢铁和机械生产任务。
    为保证在今年的最后四个月里，在钢铁和机械工业战线上高奏凯歌，获得更大、更辉煌的战果，许多省委的党委书记们都亲自出马、临阵督战，及时解决问题，总结钢铁生产的经验。
    全民办工业以后，今年全国风起云涌地出现了几万个土的或洋的小型炼钢和炼铁炉，如何使这些炼钢和炼铁炉迅速地、正常地出铁出钢，解决生产技术问题已经成为关键。为此，不少的省目前正在大力总结推广成功的经验，不少的省正在大搞钢铁试验田，不少的省还组织了强大的钢铁生产技术指导队伍。山西、广东等省，最近还出现了不少的“钢铁医疗队”，巡回在省内各地为炼铁和炼钢炉治病。中共陕西省委最近从有关单位抽调了一千名技术人员组成了六个大队，已经开赴汉中、安康、商雒、延安、榆林专区和关中地区，加强各地新建炼铁炼钢工业的技术指导。
    各地钢铁战线上的职工们正以冲天干劲，为超额完成国家交给的光荣任务而日夜苦战。
