Bursting with Confidence and Redoubling Efforts
Tianjin Steel Plant Workers Smash the Theory of Fixed Outcomes, Striving Courageously Forward

(Our newspaper Tianjin, August 27th dispatch) The workers of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, who have long failed to meet their production plans, are smashing the theory of fixed outcomes—the idea that with two-thirds of the year already passed, the leap forward plan cannot be realized—with a succession of new production records. The workers are full of confidence, guaranteeing to double steel production in the next four months, overfulfilling the striving figures in the leap forward plan.

The Tianjin Steel Plant is one of the advanced steel plants in the country, therefore, some leading cadres and workers in this plant have become complacent. When formulating the leap forward plan this spring, some people felt that the targets were already very advanced and lacked confidence in the leap forward plan proposed at that time to increase the plant's steel output by 50% compared to last year. After the leap forward plan was determined, they did not learn from the advanced experience of other factories, nor did they earnestly mobilize the masses to find ways to solve the plant's production problems. As a result, many advanced experiences and measures did not achieve the expected results. Therefore, since April this year, the plant has consistently failed to complete its production plans, and by the end of July, steel production had only reached 43.88% of the annual leap forward plan.

When Chairman Mao inspected Tianjin, he gave the people of Tianjin the instruction: "One is grain, and the other is steel. If you have these two things, everything will be easy to handle." This sentence greatly stimulated the production responsibility of the plant's workers. Many workers said: "We must take the lead in building socialist steel, but why have we been unable to complete our production plans for so long?" They proposed to fight hard for forty days to reverse the backward situation. Leading cadres also examined their complacency, criticized the theory of fixed outcomes, and studied the key issues in production. They also adopted forms such as worker representative conferences and skills competition rallies to fully mobilize the masses to overcome weak links in production and resolutely complete the leap forward plan. In the past ten days, workers have been discussing plans and emergency measures day and night. The plant's workers have proposed forty-nine major measures and are striving to put them into production in the shortest possible time. The method of smelting in front of the open hearth furnace can shorten the smelting time of each furnace of steel by about one hour. It was originally planned to put it into production on the 28th, but the steelworkers took various measures and put it into production on the 22nd.

After the steelworkers' enthusiasm was boosted, the entire plant's production outlook is undergoing tremendous changes. Since the 15th, the Qi Zisheng group of the No. 1 open hearth furnace youth steelmaking team has repeatedly set new records with times of four hours and thirteen minutes, four hours and eleven minutes, four hours and eight minutes, and three hours and fifty minutes for each furnace of steel. In the past week, the smelting time per furnace of steel in the steelmaking department has been shortened from an average of six hours per furnace last week to five hours and six minutes per furnace. The No. 1 open hearth furnace alone has produced more than one hundred tons of high-quality steel. At present, they have further proposed to raise the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces from the current highest record of 11.5 tons of steel per square meter per day to 14 tons before National Day, catching up with the advanced level of the Shanghai Steel Plant.

### 满怀信心加一番  天津钢厂职工大破定局论奋勇直前

　　满怀信心加一番
    天津钢厂职工大破定局论奋勇直前
    本报天津27日电　长期没有完成生产计划的国营天津钢厂的职工，正以一个接着一个的生产新纪录，大破一年已过去三分之二，跃进计划无法实现的大局已定的定局论。工人们满怀信心地保证在今后四个月内使钢的产量加一番，超额完成跃进计划中的争取数字。
    天津钢厂是全国先进的钢厂之一，因此，这个厂的部分领导干部和工人有自满情绪。今年春天制定跃进计划时，有的人认为指标已经很先进，对于当时提出今年全厂钢产量比去年增加50％的跃进计划信心不足。跃进计划确定后，他们没有学习外厂的先进经验，也没有认真地发动群众想办法解决本厂的生产问题。以致许多先进经验和措施达不到预期的效果。因此，这个厂从今年4月份以来，一直没有完成生产计划，到7月底为止，钢的产量只完成了全年跃进计划的43.88％。
    毛主席到天津视察时，曾对天津人民提出了“一个粮食、一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了”的指示。这句话大大激发了这个厂职工的生产责任心。许多工人说：“建设社会主义钢铁要一马当先，可是我们为什么长期完不成生产计划。他们提出要苦战四十天，扭转落后局面。领导干部也检查了自满情绪，批判了定局论，研究生产上的关键问题。他们还采取了职工代表大会、比武大会等形式，充分地发动群众克服生产中的薄弱环节，坚决完成跃进计划。近十天以来，工人们夜以继日地讨论计划、突击措施。全厂职工已提出四十九项重大措施，并力争在最短期间投入生产。化铁炉前膛吹炼的办法，能使每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短一小时左右，原计划二十八日投入生产，但是炼钢工人们采取各种措施，结果在22日就投入了生产。
    炼钢工人们的干劲鼓足以后，正使全厂的生产面貌发生巨大的变化。从15日以来，一号平炉青年炼钢班齐子升小组，连续每炉钢以四小时十三分、四小时十一分、四小时零八分、三小时五十分的成绩四次首创新记录。最近一周以来，炼钢部每炉钢的熔炼时间，已由上周的平均六小时一炉，缩短到五时零六分一炉，仅一号平炉就多出了一百多吨优质钢。目前，他们更进一步地提出，在国庆节前决心使平炉的利用系数由目前每平方公尺日产十一点五吨钢的最高纪录，提高到十四吨，赶上上海钢厂的先进水平。
