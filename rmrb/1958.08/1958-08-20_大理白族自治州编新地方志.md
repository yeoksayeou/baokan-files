Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 19th: Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province is compiling new local chronicles.

The Dali Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that the new local chronicles, in accordance with Marxist-Leninist viewpoints, truthfully record the deeds of the laboring people of the prefecture in their struggles for production and class struggle, especially the great achievements made under the leadership of the Communist Party in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution.

This work is being piloted in Yangbi County first. In June, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, a County Chronicle Editorial Committee was established, and cadres from other counties in the autonomous prefecture participated. The editorial committee is divided into five groups: agriculture, industry, culture, education and health, politics and law, and natural conditions, each of which goes deep into the masses to interview them about the situation from the liberation in 1949 until the recent great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. They also critically absorb past historical materials. In two months, rich materials have been collected and the first draft is being prepared, with the aim of finalizing it in October. Then, other counties in the prefecture will generally begin compiling new county chronicles, which are expected to be basically completed in the first half of next year. In the second half of the year, the prefectural chronicles of the autonomous prefecture will be compiled on the basis of the county chronicles of each county.

　　大理白族自治州编新地方志
    据新华社昆明19日电云南省大理白族自治州编写新地方志。
    中共大理地委要求在新地方志中，按照马克思列宁主义观点，真实地记载本州劳动人民在生产斗争与阶级斗争中的事迹，特别是在共产党领导下进行民主革命和社会主义革命所取得的伟大成绩。
    这一工作首先在漾鼻县试点。6月份，在县委领导下成立了县志编辑委员会，自治州其它各县都派了干部参加。编委会下分农业、工业、文教卫生、政法和自然概况等五个组，分头深入群众采访从1949年解放直到最近工农业生产大跃进的情况，也批判地吸收过去的史料。在两个月中已搜集到丰富的资料，正开始编写初稿，准备在十月份定稿。然后，州内其它县即普遍开始编写新县志，预计在明年上半年基本完成。下半年在各县县志的基础上，编写出自治州的州志。
