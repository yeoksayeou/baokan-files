Small Information

    Biogas, also known as methane gas, is usually produced by the closed fermentation of waste materials such as manure, garbage, and weeds. Biogas is a flammable gas that releases a large amount of heat when burned.

    The use of biogas in some areas of China is gradually becoming widespread. Currently, in addition to direct use for lighting, boiling water, and cooking, many areas have begun to use it for pumping water, generating electricity, and experimentally running cars instead of gasoline. The Biogas Research Group of the Guiyang Municipal Bureau of Industry has also successfully experimented with using biogas to replace acetylene for welding metals.

　　沼气
    沼气又叫甲烷气体，通常是用粪便、垃圾、杂草等废弃物经过密闭发酵而发生的。沼气是一种易燃气体，燃烧后可以发生大量热能。
    我国一些地区利用沼气逐渐广泛，目前除了直接用于点灯照明、烧水煮饭外，已有不少地区开始用它抽水、发电和代替汽油试开汽车。贵阳市工业局沼气研究组，并试验成功了用沼气代乙炔焊接金属。
