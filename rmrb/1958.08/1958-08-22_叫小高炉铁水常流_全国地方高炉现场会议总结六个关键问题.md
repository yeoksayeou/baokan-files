Xinhua News Agency, Shaoyang, August 21st: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a national conference on local blast furnaces in Shaoyang City, Hunan Province, from August 6th to 14th. More than 400 representatives from 28 provinces and cities across the country, relevant universities, scientific research institutions, and state organs attended the meeting. The meeting discussed how to accelerate the construction of indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces, and quickly put the completed blast furnaces into production, so as to ensure the great leap forward in steel production this year. Representatives from various regions believed that under the current conditions, by exerting full effort and striving for the best, the pig iron production target for 1958 could be guaranteed.

Currently, a vigorous mass movement to build indigenous and small blast furnaces has been launched across the country. By the end of July, it is estimated that more than 30,000 indigenous and small blast furnaces have been built nationwide, far exceeding the blast furnace construction targets proposed by various provinces and cities at the local metallurgical conference in April this year. There are many types of indigenous and small blast furnaces in various regions, with varying degrees of complexity. Among them, there are many advanced types, such as the 1.8 cubic meter water-tapping indigenous furnace in Shaodong, Hunan; the 2-4 cubic meter large indigenous furnace in Sichuan and Guizhou; the 2.5 cubic meter improved indigenous furnace of the Mashankou type in Henan; and the improved simple small blast furnaces of Anping Iron Plant and Renhe Iron Plant in Shaoyang. The construction speed is also amazing. Shaoyang Prefecture originally had only 50 indigenous furnaces, but in the past three months, it has developed to 9,000. Many vivid examples from various places fully demonstrate the correctness of the policy of "indigenous" and "small" as the mainstay, and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods in the local iron smelting industry.

The meeting believed that the development of the iron smelting industry is currently unbalanced. Some advanced units have already built many indigenous and small blast furnaces, and most of them have been put into production. However, some units have built a large number of indigenous furnaces, but not many have been put into production, or they cannot produce iron normally after being put into production. The meeting pointed out that this is an unavoidable phenomenon in the unprecedented great leap forward of the iron smelting industry, a difficulty in development, and can be completely reversed in a short period of time. Based on the results of the meeting's discussions, Liu Bin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, put forward several key points for future iron smelting work in his summary:

First, it is necessary to put politics in command, implement the mass line, implement the policy of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, exert full effort, strive for the best, and develop the local iron smelting industry in a faster, better, and more economical way. In terms of blast furnace types, they should be simplified appropriately. The newly built indigenous blast furnaces in various provinces and regions should consider adopting the Shaoyang flowing water type indigenous furnace with a slightly larger volume and better furnace type. For the small blast furnaces combining indigenous and foreign methods, consider adopting the simple small blast furnaces of Mashankou in Henan and Shaoyang area, and the Shaoyang-style small blast furnaces combining indigenous and foreign methods designed by some comrades with reference to the Shaoyang blast furnace structure during this meeting.

Second, seize the time to accelerate construction, and quickly put the completed indigenous and small blast furnaces into production, master the technology, and improve the start-up rate. Take active actions, build while producing, in order to give full play to the production capacity of the newly built furnaces, quickly train operators, and strive for the highest pig iron output.

Third, while building furnaces, we must strengthen mining work and solve the supply of coke and white coal. All localities must grasp blast furnaces with one hand and raw materials with the other. The construction of indigenous and small blast furnaces should preferably be close to coal and iron producing areas, at least close to coal or close to iron. More should be built in areas with more raw materials, less in areas with fewer raw materials, and none in areas without raw materials.

Fourth, in the large-scale development of indigenous and small blast furnaces, the arrangement of labor between industry and agriculture is a new issue. In prefectures or counties and townships with conditions to build a large number of indigenous blast furnaces, it is necessary to make overall plans based on the possibility of labor supply.

Fifth, further adopt various simple operating methods, and strive to train a large number of technical backbones in iron smelting in a short period of time to ensure the smooth start of production after a large number of blast furnaces are built.

Sixth, constantly innovate technology. We should vigorously improve the air blowing equipment, refractory materials, and operating technology to increase output and quality. (Attached picture)

　　叫小高炉铁水常流
    全国地方高炉现场会议总结六个关键问题
    据新华社邵阳21日电  冶金工业部8月6日到14日在湖南省邵阳市召开了全国地方高炉会议。参加会议的有全国二十八个省市、有关高等学校、科学研究机关和国家机关的代表四百多人。会议对如何加速建设土高炉和小高炉，并迅速将已经建成的高炉投入生产，以保证今年钢铁生产大跃进，进行了讨论。各地区代表认为在目前条件下鼓足干劲，力争上游，1958年的生铁生产任务是可以保证完成的。
    目前全国各地已经展开了轰轰烈烈的土高炉和小高炉建设运动。到7月底止，估计全国建成的土小高炉已经达到三万座以上，远远超过了今年4月地方冶金会议上各省市提出的高炉建设指标。各地区土高炉小高炉的类型很多，繁简各异。其中有不少先进的型式，如湖南邵东一点八立方公尺放水式土炉，四川贵州二——四立方公尺大型土炉，河南马山口式二点五立方公尺改良土炉，邵阳安平铁厂、人和铁厂的改良式简易小高炉。在建设速度上也很惊人，邵阳专区原有土炉仅五十座，最近三个月内发展到了九千座。各地的许多生动事例充分表明地方炼铁工业以“土”“小”为主、土洋结合方针的正确性。
    会议认为，当前炼铁工业的发展是不平衡的，有些先进单位已经建设了很多土高炉、小高炉，并且有大部分投入生产；但也有些单位虽已建成大批土炉，但投入生产的不多，或者投入生产后不能正常出铁。会议指出，这是炼铁工业空前大跃进中一时不可避免的现象，是发展中的困难，是完全可以在短时间内彻底扭转的。根据会议讨论的结果，冶金工业部副部长刘彬在总结中提出了今后开展炼铁工作的几个关键和要点：
    第一，必须政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，贯彻以中小为主的方针，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地发展地方炼铁事业。在高炉类型上应该适当地简化，各省区新建的土高炉应考虑采用容积稍大、炉型较好的邵阳流水式土炉；土洋结合的小高炉，可以考虑采用河南马山口和邵阳区的简易小高炉，和这次会议期间一部分同志参考邵阳高炉结构设计的土洋结合邵阳式小高炉。
    第二，争取时间加速建设，并迅速将已建成的土高炉和小高炉投入生产，掌握技术，提高开工率。积极行动起来，边建设，边生产，以期充分发挥新建炉子的生产能力，迅速培养操作工人，争取最高的生铁产量。
    第三，在建炉的同时，必须加强矿山工作，解决焦炭和白煤的供应问题。各地必须一手抓高炉，一手抓原料。土高炉及小型高炉的建设最好接近煤铁产地，至少接近煤或接近铁，原料较多的地区多建，原料少的地区少建，没有原料的地区不建。
    第四，在大量发展土高炉和小高炉中，工农业间劳动力的安排是一个新的问题。在有条件建设大量土高炉的专区或县乡，有必要根据劳动力供应的可能，通盘规划。
    第五，进一步采用各种简易操作方式，争取短时间内培养出大批炼铁方面的技术骨干，以保证大量高炉建成后顺利开工生产。
    第六，不断地革新技术。应大力改进鼓风设备，耐火材料和操作技术等，以提高产量和质量。（附图片）
