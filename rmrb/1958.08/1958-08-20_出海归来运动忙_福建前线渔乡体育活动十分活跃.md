Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th: Various sports activities among the broad masses of fishermen and farmers on the Fujian coastal defense frontline are very active, with the assistance and guidance of the local garrison.

Here, every holiday or evening, sports activities are taking place on every sports ground from the islands to the fishing ports. Fishermen returning from deep-sea fishing, as soon as they land, are playing matches with the local garrison soldiers on beach volleyball courts made with old masts as net posts and old fishing nets as nets.

At present, in the coastal areas of Fujian, basketball courts, volleyball courts, and track and field activity grounds jointly opened up by the military and civilians have spread all over the islands and fishing ports. Fishermen and farmers have organized a particularly large number of various sports teams and other sports organizations. In various sports activities, a large number of outstanding athletes have emerged here, becoming strong forces in the Fujian sports scene and other sports. Pinghai Town, a famous fishing village in Putian County on the coastal defense outpost, has a fishermen's volleyball team that was established and grew up with the help of the local garrison. Due to regular friendly matches and exchanges of experience with the local garrison, the technical level has rapidly improved, and the team has continued to grow. Now the whole team has more than one hundred members. It has won many victories in Putian County sports meets and has become the most outstanding champion team in the county's volleyball teams. Many working women in fishing villages also often appear on the sports field and have established one outstanding women's team after another.

The military sports activities of the broad masses of militiamen and young people on the coast are even more outstanding. Under the guidance of the local garrison, and after a long period of hard training and study, their performance in military sports activities such as live ammunition shooting, grenade throwing, and pole climbing is very good. Thousands of "excellent shooters" who can fire multiple shots in succession have emerged in various fishing villages and islands, and they have gradually mastered the shooting skills of various weapons.

　　出海归来运动忙
　　福建前线渔乡体育活动十分活跃
    据新华社福州19日电  福建海防前线广大渔民和农民的各种体育活动，在当地驻军的帮助和指导下，显得十分活跃。
    这里，每当假日或傍晚，从海岛到渔港的各个运动场上，都有体育活动在进行。远航捕鱼归来的渔民们，刚一登陆，就在用旧桅杆作球架、旧鱼网当球网的海滩排球场上和当地驻军的战士们进行比赛。
    目前，福建沿海地区，由军民共同开辟的篮球场、排球场和田径活动场已遍布各个海岛和渔港。渔民和农民们组织各种球队和其他体育运动组织也特别多。在各种体育活动中，这里已涌现出大批出色的运动员，成为福建省球坛上和其他运动中劲旅。海防前哨著名渔乡莆田县平海镇，在当地驻军帮助下建立和成长起来的渔民排球队，由于经常和当地驻军进行友谊赛、交流经验，技术水平迅速提高，队伍不断壮大，现在全队已拥有一百多个队员，在莆田县多次运动会上百战百胜，成为全县排球队中最出色的冠军队。许多渔乡的广大劳动妇女，也经常出现在运动场上，建立起一支又一支出色的妇女球队。
    沿海广大民兵和青年的军事体育活动成绩更为出色。他们在当地驻军的辅导下，经过长期苦练苦学，实弹射击、投掷手榴弹、爬竿等军事体育活动成绩十分良好。各渔乡和海岛上涌现出成千上万名连发连中的“优秀射手”，并逐渐掌握各种武器的射击技术。
