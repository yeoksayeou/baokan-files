　　A Pioneer Charging into Cultural and Scientific Fields
　　——An Interview with a University Graduate from a Miner Background
　　By our reporter Zhu Jigong

    Over one hundred and thirty coal miners, once labeled "dirty coal blacks" in the old society, have recently graduated from the Beijing Mining Institute. It is the first time in our country that coal miners have graduated from higher education institutions in such large numbers.

    In a room marked "Design Office," a group of young people are either intensely manipulating T-squares and drawing boards or are using slide rules as if they are calculating some complex engineering problem. If one didn't see the school badges on their chests, one might think they were designers from a design institute. This semester, the Beijing Mining Institute, in conjunction with the students' work-study graduation projects, has contracted several coal mine design tasks from the Ministry of Coal Industry. Among them, the mining plans for two coal mines designed by university students from coal miner backgrounds have been adopted by industrial departments and are under construction. For this school, it is also a first to have graduating students who haven't even left the school gates yet be able to do real design work!

    These university students come from various coal mines in Datong, Fushun, Kailuan, and Jiawang. Who could have imagined that just seven or eight years ago, they only had a primary school education? One student said meaningfully, "Eight years ago today, we couldn't recognize a single large character! Now, we have finally completed this difficult journey."

    How was this difficult journey traversed?

    In 1950, the China Coal Miner's Accelerated Secondary School was established in Qinhuangdao. The Party and the government transferred a group of outstanding coal miners from coal mines across the country to study there. Putting down the pickaxe and shovel and picking up books and pens was a different ballgame. Many learning difficulties came at them like an overwhelming tide. Wu Huaiqi, from a poor peasant family, had no ancestors who had ever attended school; he had only learned the "Thousand Character Classic" or something similar in his childhood. At that time, the accelerated secondary school placed him in the lowest-level class based on his arithmetic proficiency. While students in other classes went to participate in recreational activities, Wu Huaiqi and his classmates were still taking remedial lessons. Slowly, these people who didn't know what difficulties were improved their learning methods, launched a campaign to find tricks, find key points, and break through difficulties. Chemical terms and valences were difficult to remember, so the teachers and they together used the tune of "Singing of Erlang Mountain" to compose a "Valence Song," singing it before and after meals:

    Hydrogen, potassium, sodium, chlorine, silver, and bromine, they are monovalent,
    Oxygen, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, calcium, and magnesium, they are divalent,
    Aluminum is trivalent, phosphorus is pentavalent…

    Day and night, chasing and rushing, they finally learned all the junior and senior high school courses. Wu Huaiqi said, "There is no secret to learning culture. The more difficult and fearful you are, the worse it gets. You just have to attack and delve in, and there is nothing you cannot overcome."

    But after overcoming one difficulty, even greater difficulties awaited them. In the summer of 1954, the vast majority of the miners from this accelerated secondary school were admitted to the Beijing Mining Institute, assigned to study in departments such as coal mining, mine electrical and mechanical engineering, mine machinery, and mine construction. The first year of university was the most difficult. "Higher Mathematics" and "Physics" were basic courses with strong theoretical foundations, and they felt that they were all abstract "concepts" that they couldn't touch or grasp, and their brains couldn't turn around. However, they were not intimidated. They thought: although students graduating from regular high schools have a better foundation and find it easier to learn, we also have many favorable conditions: first of all, our purpose in learning is clearer, and our motivation for learning is also stronger; secondly, we are more familiar with the production situation in the mines... moreover, we have the close care of the Party organization!

    Xu Yaolin, who started working in the mine at the age of twelve, came through in this way. When he started learning "Theoretical Mechanics," he always felt that this thing was a bit "mysterious," what with vertical forces, frictional forces, always entangled and unclear. Later, he thought carefully, doesn't the mine have this situation: when he pushes a coal cart underground, isn't there friction? He also analyzed the various forces acting on him when pushing the cart up and down, forward and backward. With this connection to reality, "Theoretical Mechanics" was no longer a difficult thing. Wei Hanzhang was originally a coal miner from the Fushun Mine. In the first semester, he did not do well in "Theoretical Mechanics" and got a "two," but he was not discouraged. He canceled his plan to go home for the New Year and used the entire winter vacation to study "Theoretical Mechanics" repeatedly, and later got a "five" on the make-up exam.

    Mining students also encountered some setbacks in the learning process. Some teachers did not believe they could learn well, and therefore adopted the wrong attitude of sarcasm and ridicule. Wu Huaiqi said that once a tutor said, "These mining students are all blockheads; they still don't understand after I've explained it several times!" When the mining students heard this, they were all very angry. But just being angry was not enough, so they secretly worked hard, determined to learn their lessons well. The school leadership noticed this problem in time and formed worker-peasant classes specifically for the mining students, selected more outstanding teachers, allowed them to be exempt from Russian... These measures effectively guaranteed their learning quality, and the phenomenon of failing grades gradually disappeared.

    After completing the first and second year of basic courses, it became much easier to learn professional courses. Wei Hanzhang told the reporter an interesting story: Once, when the teacher talked about "roof fall" in class, the mining students immediately knew that it referred to "roof collapse" in the mine, but ordinary high school graduates only thought it was a "rivet" and couldn't understand it at all.

    This situation was even more obvious during production practice. Ordinary high school students panicked when they went down to the mine for the first time, let alone actual operation. However, these young men from the coal mine went into the mine as if they were returning to their mother's home, making quite a stir. Drilling holes, setting off explosives, pushing carts, moving wood, they were very skilled at everything. When some old workers in the mine saw their skilled "tricks," they knew they were "experts," so they let them do it with confidence, and they learned even more.

    This academic year is also the final year of graduation. These mining students undertook the design tasks of the Zhubian No. 2 Mine and the Xiahuayuan Mine in Hebei Province. There was very little geological data for these two mines. After several discussions, they came up with several comparative plans for each mine. In teaching, teachers mostly talk about new mechanized equipment such as combines and coal cutters, but these two mines cannot use them. They used their own experience to design with indigenous methods. During this process, everyone showed daring to think and do creativity. For example, according to conventional mining methods, construction is one set and production is another set, but mining students linked construction and production together, which can reduce half of the technical management personnel and save a lot of investment for the country. They also designed wooden rail narrow railways and semi-automatic mine cars for the mine. The plans designed by the mining students, flexibly applying professional knowledge and following the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, have been formally adopted by the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry and have begun construction. This practice tested them and improved them a step further.

    As they bid farewell to their alma mater, the students all felt reluctant to leave. They have all formulated red and expert plans, promising the Party to reach the level of assistant engineer within two or three years, and determined to continue to be "pioneers" of the technological revolution and cultural revolution in their production posts.

　　向文化科学进军的闯将
　　——访矿工出身的大学毕业生
　　本报记者　朱继功
    在旧社会被称为“臭煤黑子”的一百三十多名煤矿工人，最近从北京矿业学院毕业了。煤矿工人成批地从高等学校毕业，在我国还是第一次。
    在挂着“设计室”字样的屋子里，一群年轻人有的在紧张地摆弄丁字尺和画板；有的在拉计算尺，像是在核算工程上什么复杂的问题。如果不看他们胸襟上挂着的校徽，人们还以为是设计院的设计师呢。这学期，北京矿业学院结合学生们的勤工俭学毕业设计，承包了煤炭工业部几个煤矿的设计任务。其中由煤矿工人出身的大学生们设计的两个煤矿的开采方案，已被工业部门采纳，开始施工了。对于这个学校来说，还没有跨出学校大门的应届毕业生就能够真刀真枪地做出设计，也是个首创哩！
    这批大学生来自大同、抚顺、开滦、贾汪各个煤矿。谁能想到七、八年前，他们还只有初小文化程度呢。有位同学意味深长地说：“八年前的今天，斗大的字识不到一担！现在，我们终于走完了这段艰难的路程。”
    这段艰难的路程是怎样走过来的？
    1950年，中国煤矿工人速成中学在秦皇岛成立了。党和政府从全国各地煤矿抽调了一批优秀的煤矿工人到那里去学习。刚放下洋镐、铁锹，拿起书本、笔杆，就不是一股味儿。许多学习上的困难如排山倒海般地向他们冲上来。贫农家庭出身的吴怀起，祖祖辈辈没有进过学堂，幼年间只念过“千字文”什么的。当时，速成中学根据算术程度的高低，把他编在程度最低的一班。其它班的同学参加文娱活动去了，吴怀起和他的同学们还在补课。慢慢地，这些不知困难的人们又改进学习方法，开展找窍门运动，找关键，突破难关。化学名词和原子价记起来挺费劲，教师就和他们一起用“歌唱二郎山”的调子编成“原子价歌”，饭前饭后就这样唱起来：
    氢钾钠氯银溴，它们是一价，
    氧铜铅锌汞钙镁，它们是二价，
    铝三价来磷五价……
    白天黑夜，紧追紧赶，终于把所有初、高中的课程学完了。吴怀起说：“学文化也没有什么秘密，越难越惶恐，越糟。只有一个劲儿地攻、钻，没有不能克服的。”
    可是克服了一段困难，更大的困难又在等待着他们。1954年夏天，这个速成中学绝大多数矿工考上了北京矿业学院，分配在采煤、矿山机电、矿山机械、矿山建筑等系里学习。大学头一年，是最难过的一年。“高等数学”、“物理”都是理论性很强的基础课，他们感到净是些抽象的“概念”，摸不到、抓不住，脑子转不过弯来啊。但是，他们并没有被吓唬住。他们想：从中学毕业出来的同学，虽然基础比较好，学起来不大困难。但是咱们也有许多有利的条件：首先，学习的目的性比他们明确，学习的动力也足；其次，对矿上生产情况比较熟悉……更何况还有党组织亲切的关怀呢！
    十二岁就在矿上做工的许耀临，就是这样走过来的。他开始学习“理论力学”的时候，总觉得这玩意儿有点“玄乎”，什么垂直力啊，磨擦力啊，老是纠缠不清。后来，他仔细一想，矿上不是有这种情况：当他在井下推煤斗车的时候，不是就有磨擦作用么？他又分析了他在推车时上下、前后几种受力的情况。这样一联系实际，“理论力学”就不是什么困难的东西了。魏汉章原来是抚顺矿上的采煤工，第一学期他的“理论力学”没学好，捞到个“二分”，但是他没有泄气，他取消了回家过年的计划，利用整个寒假期间，把“理论力学”反反复复学了几遍，以后补考得了个“五分”。
    矿工学生们学习过程中也遇到过一些挫折，曾有个别教师不相信他们会学好，因而采取了冷嘲热讽的错误态度。吴怀起说，有一次某辅导教师说：“这班矿工学生都是笨脑袋，连讲了好几遍，还是不懂！”矿工学生们听说以后，都很气愤。但是光气愤不行，他们就暗地使劲，决心非把功课学好不可。学校领导上及时注意到这个问题，为矿工学生单独编成了工农班，选派比较优秀的教师，允许他们免修俄文……这些措施有力地保证了他们的学习质量，不及格的现象逐渐消灭了。
    学完了一、二年级基础课，学起专业课就容易得多了。魏汉章给记者讲了个有趣的故事：有一次教师讲课中讲到“冒顶”时，矿工学生一听说就知道是指矿上的“顶板塌落”，可是一般高中毕业同学只以为是“铆钉”，怎么也听不懂。
    这种情况在生产实习中就更加明显，一般高中学生初次下矿，心里就慌得不行，更甭提实际操作了。可是，这批从煤矿来的小伙子钻到矿井里，就像回到娘家一样，闹得可欢腾呢。打眼放炮，推小车，搬木料，干什么都挺利索。矿上一些老工人一看到他们熟练的“把式”，就知道是“行家”，也就放心地让他们干，学到的东西也就更加丰富了。
    这学年，也是毕业的最后一年。这些矿工学生们担负了河北省竹边二矿和下花园矿的设计任务。这两个矿的地质资料很少，他们经过多次讨论，然后给每个矿作出了几种比较方案。在教学中教师讲的多是康拜因、截煤机等新式的机械化设备，但是这两个矿都用不上。他们就根据自己的经验，用土办法进行设计。这中间大伙发挥了敢想、敢做的创造性。例如按照常规开采一个矿，施工是一套，生产又是一套，矿工学生却把施工同生产联结起来，这样可以减少一半技术管理人员，为国家节省大量的投资。他们还为矿上设计了木轨小铁道、半自动斗车。矿工学生们灵活运用专业知识，根据多快好省的方针设计成的方案，已经为河北省工业厅正式采纳，并已开始施工。这次实践，考验了他们，也使他们提高了一步。
    临别母校，学生们都感到依恋不舍。他们都已制定了红专规划，向党保证要在二、三年内达到助理工程师的水平，并且决心在生产岗位上继续作技术革命和文化革命的“闯将”。（附图片）
