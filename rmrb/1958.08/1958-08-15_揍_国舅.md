Beating the "Royal Brother-in-Law"
Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill Workers Zhang Fayuan, Zhang Jinfeng

	In the Shuangxi Yarn Factory (now Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill), everyone curses the "Royal Brother-in-Law." "That kid is purely un-Chinese, a Japanese running dog!" The "Royal Brother-in-Law's" real name was Li Engui. He was in his twenties, wore a blue cloth gown, and always carried a stick. His triangular eyes were as big as eggs, and he walked around the workshop monitoring the workers. He spoke fluent Japanese and, relying on the close relationship between his sister (the Shuangxi Yarn Factory's telephone operator) and the Japanese manager Kitagawa, he committed all kinds of evil deeds in the factory.

	In the "warp and weft" section of the yarn factory, workers in the cloth yard and preparation and sorting rooms had to pass through a certain area to go to the toilet. The "Royal Brother-in-Law" would lurk around there like he’d swallowed rat poison. If anyone displeased him, he would hit them with his stick. If he saw a female worker he liked, he would try to take advantage of her. If she didn't comply, he would complain to the Japanese and she would be fired and sent home.

	The workers didn't even have freedom to defecate. The "Royal Brother-in-Law" would often follow them into the toilet to inspect them, making the workers bend over to show their anuses to see if there was any stool. He did this even to the female workers. If anyone's anus was empty, he would hit them with his stick and then punish them – making them hold up oranges, heald frames, or iron bars. Sometimes, while they were holding things up, they would also be whipped with rattan canes. Any slight movement would result in even harsher beatings.

	At that time, the workers worked twelve hours a day. After finishing the night shift, they had to go to the new Zhongshan Steel Factory to do odd jobs. Even though they worked day and night without a break, they still didn't have enough to eat or wear. Once, Liu Futin, a maintenance worker in the cloth yard, stole two tufts of cotton, and the "Royal Brother-in-Law" discovered it. As a result, Liu Futin was beaten half to death in the sorting workshop, until he was almost out of breath before they carried him away. Liu Futin died less than a week later.

	The workers hated the "Royal Brother-in-Law" and wanted to get back at him, but they had no opportunity.

	In the summer of 1944, the "Royal Brother-in-Law" posted a notice in the cloth yard, stating that after the warp workers finished loading the warps, they were not allowed to rest; otherwise, they would be dealt with harshly. This notice angered the workers. Warp workers Su Baoyu, Zhang Fayuan, and others held a secret meeting during their lunch break to discuss how to deal with the "Royal Brother-in-Law".... Su Baoyu said: "Tomorrow is Saturday. The 'Royal Brother-in-Law' always goes home early on Saturdays. He has to cross the river. I'll leave first tomorrow and wait for him outside. You wait for the good news of 'getting even'!"

	The next afternoon, sure enough, the "Royal Brother-in-Law" quietly left the factory. Su Baoyu had already changed his clothes and was watching him. He also had other workers watching the "Royal Brother-in-Law" from behind.

	Feeling guilty, the "Royal Brother-in-Law" walked while looking back. When he reached the Zhengzhuangzi police station, his pace quickened. Su Baoyu also quickened his pace and shouted, "Chase him!" They arrived at the Yangzhuangzi ferry. The "Royal Brother-in-Law" jumped onto the boat, hoping that the ferry would quickly go to the other side so that Su Baoyu couldn't catch up. But things didn't go as the running dog wished. Su Baoyu rushed onto the ferry. The "Royal Brother-in-Law" turned pale with fright. Perhaps he was afraid of being thrown into the Hai River.

	There were many people on the boat, making it difficult to take action. After getting off the boat, before the "Royal Brother-in-Law" could react, Su Baoyu grabbed him by the collar and started slapping him in the face. The "Royal Brother-in-Law" couldn't fight back and was pinned to the ground. The rickshaw pullers at the ferry, not knowing the truth, came over to persuade them. Su Baoyu shouted to everyone: "Do you know who he is? He is our factory's 'Royal Brother-in-Law,' a Japanese lackey. Chinese people have to have their anuses checked by him even when they defecate!" With that one sentence, the rickshaw pullers' eyes turned red. Seven or eight people shouted in unison, "Beat him, beat the lackey!" and joined the fight.... By the time the "Royal Brother-in-Law" got up, the people had already run away.

	After liberation, people in the factory were still looking for the whereabouts of the "Royal Brother-in-Law," but unfortunately, there were no clues. Last year, he was exposed by the people of Shanghai and sentenced to eighteen years in prison by the state. When the news came, the workers in our factory were overjoyed.

　　揍“国舅”
　　天津棉纺五厂工人　张法元　张金凤
    在双喜纱厂
  （今天津棉纺五厂）提起“国舅”来没有一个人不骂他的，“这小子纯粹不是中国人，是他妈的日本走狗！”“国舅”的本名叫李恩珪，二十多岁，身穿蓝布大褂，手里不离一个棍子，两支三角眼瞪得鸡蛋大，在车间里走来走去监视着工人。他的日本话说得挺流利，又仗着他姐姐（双喜纱厂的电话员）与日本经理北川姘靠的关系，在厂里无恶不作。
    在纱厂穿和科这个地方，不论布场工人和准备间、整理间的工人上厕所都要路过，“国舅”就在这里像吃了耗子药似的钻来钻去，不知谁若不顺他眼，过去就是几棍子，看那个女工长得好点儿就过去找便宜，若不顺着他，他在日本人面前一叽咕，就得开除回家。
    工人们连大便都没有自由，“国舅”常常跟到厕所里去检查，让工人们蹶起屁股看肛门有没有屎，连女工也如此。谁若肛门无屎，上去又是几棍子，出来还得受刑罚——举橙子、举综框子、举铁棍子，有时上面举着下面还得吃“面条”（藤子棍）稍微一动，抽打得就更厉害了。
    那时工人一天干十二小时的活，下了夜班还得到新中山钢厂干些零活，虽然是黑夜白天地连轴转可是仍然没吃没穿。有一次布场保全工人刘富亭偷了两支棉头让“国舅”发现了，结果把刘富亭放在整理车间打得死去活来，一直打得刘连口气也快没有了才让人抬走。没过一星期刘富亭就死了。
    工人们恨透了“国舅”，都想找个机会收拾他一通，只是苦于没有机会。
    1944年夏天，“国舅”在布场贴了一张布告，让挂轴工人上完轴以后，不得再休息，否则不客气。这布告激怒了工人，挂轴工苏宝玉、张法元等六、七个人利用吃饭时间开了秘密会议，研究对付“国舅”的办法……。苏宝玉说：“明天是礼拜六，‘国舅’每礼拜六都早回家，他得过河，我明天先走，到外边去等他，你们就等着听‘出气’的好消息吧！”
    第二天下午，果然，“国舅”悄悄地走出工厂。苏宝玉已换了身衣服早盯上他了，还让其他工友也盯在“国舅”身后。
    做贼心虚的“国舅”一边走一边回头看着，当他走到郑庄子派出所时脚步越来越快，苏宝玉也加快了脚步“追！”杨庄子渡口到了，“国舅”窜上了船，他恨不得渡船赶快开往对岸，好叫苏宝玉追赶不上来。事情偏不遂走狗的心愿，苏宝玉一步抢上了渡船，“国舅”吓得脸都白了。他也许怕把他扔到海河里去。
    船上人多，不易动手，下了船，没等“国舅”注意，苏宝玉过去就抓住他的脖领，噼哧叭嚓地就往他脸上打去，“国舅”还手不及被捺在地上不能动了。渡口的人力车夫们不明真象就过来相劝，苏宝玉就向大家喊道：“你们大伙知道他是谁吗？他是我们厂的‘国舅’，日本的狗腿子，中国人拉屎都得由他看看屁眼子！”一句话，说得拉车的哥儿们也红了眼，七、八个人齐声喊了声“打，打狗腿子！”也参加了战斗……。等“国舅”爬起来的时候，人们早已跑了。
    解放以后，厂里的人们都还到处打听“国舅”的下落，可惜一直没有线索。去年他被上海人民揭发出来，被国家判处了十八年徒刑。消息传来，我们厂里的工人都乐坏了。　　〔张金凤、王恕岩整理〕
