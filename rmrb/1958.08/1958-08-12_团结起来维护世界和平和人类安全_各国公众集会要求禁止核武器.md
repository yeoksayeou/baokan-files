Xinhua News Agency report: On the eve of the opening of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, many places around the world have held gatherings to support the conference, demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the realization of disarmament, and solemnly condemning the arms expansion and war preparation policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and the stubborn attitude of the United States and Britain in refusing to stop nuclear weapons testing. This demonstrates the strong will and great strength of the vast people of the world in defending peace.

	Japan
	Starting from June 20, various cities in Japan held "Days to Prevent Nuclear Armament of Japan and Uphold Democracy." People in various prefectures successively held peace gatherings to mourn the victims of the American atomic bombings thirteen years ago.
	On the morning of August 9th, Nagasaki City held a peace gathering with 2,200 participants at Peace Park, commemorating the victims of the American atomic bombing. The Mayor of Nagasaki City, Tagawa, read out the peace declaration at the meeting in a firm tone. The declaration called for the complete destruction and immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and stated that all the people of Nagasaki City would further exert their utmost efforts to become pioneers in the struggle for lasting world peace.
	Youth in Kanagawa Prefecture held a peace conference on the evenings of August 9th and 10th at the Kamakura seaside.

	India
	Delhi held a public gathering on the evening of August 10th and passed a resolution demanding that countries possessing nuclear weapons immediately and unconditionally cease all nuclear tests and the production of nuclear weapons.
	The chairman of the meeting, Sundarlal, the Mayor of Delhi, Mrs. Aruna Asaf Ali, and the secretary of the Delhi Committee of the Communist Party of India, Ruki, all vehemently criticized the aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British imperialism at the meeting.
	The meeting expressed its support for the resolutions of the recent Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference held in Stockholm.

	United States
	The "Greater New York Committee for Sane Nuclear Policy" held a demonstration near the United Nations Building in New York on August 6th. Participants in the demonstration issued a statement saying that thirteen years after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, nuclear weapons will appear on possible battlefields, and the world is once again filled with fear. The need for peaceful resolution of disputes between countries is more urgent than ever before, because the power of nuclear war threatens the survival of mankind.
	In San Francisco, Reverend Bigelow, who intended to sail the "Golden Rule" small boat into the test area to protest American nuclear testing in the Pacific, spoke at a religious service attended by 800 people commemorating the 13th anniversary of the American atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Bigelow called on the US government to stop atomic weapons testing.

The meeting adopted the contents of a letter to the Fourth International Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons.
