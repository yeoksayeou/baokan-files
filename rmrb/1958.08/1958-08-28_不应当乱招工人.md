Commentary on Letters to the Editor:

　　Workers Should Not Be Randomly Recruited
    Our newspaper has recently received more than thirty letters from readers reflecting that some enterprises and institutions are adopting improper means to randomly pull production workers, agricultural cooperative members, and on-the-job cadres from other places, disrupting the state's labor allocation plan and affecting production order.

    Ge Yuyuan, a comrade from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry, wrote that the Yangshan White Clay Mine in Suzhou was deprived of more than seven hundred workers taken away by other units in June of this year. The remaining workers experienced emotional fluctuations and were not focused on production. The average daily attendance rate only reached 30%, and production was severely threatened. Dong Feng, a comrade from the Labor Section of Yushu County, Jilin Province, wrote that various industrial and mining enterprises in Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, privately recruited more than nine hundred people from Shuangjing Township, Jilin Province. The large outflow of labor has seriously affected agricultural production.

    Readers believe that the scale of our country's construction is growing larger, and the demand for labor is increasing year by year. Therefore, various units may experience labor shortages. To solve this problem, the main approach should be self-reliance, improving labor organization, carrying out technical innovation movements, and taking various active measures to vigorously tap the local labor potential (such as organizing family members of employees to participate in production). When all efforts have been made and the problem still cannot be solved, it is of course not absolutely forbidden to seek support from other places to recruit some personnel to supplement the workforce, but the recruitment method must comply with the national labor system and must not be random recruitment.

    Readers hope that labor departments in various regions will strengthen the management of labor recruitment and allocation work, and stop the chaotic phenomenon of random recruitment by various units.

### 不应当乱招工人

　　不应当乱招工人
    本报最近收到了三十多件读者来信，反映有些企业单位采取不正当的手段，到外地去乱拉生产工人、农业社员和在职干部，打乱国家的劳动调配计划，影响了生产秩序。
    江苏省工业厅戈裕沅同志来信说，苏州市阳山白泥矿在今年6月份被别的单位拉走七百多个工人，留下的工人情绪波动，不安心生产，平均每日出勤率只达到30％，生产受到严重的威胁。吉林省榆树县劳动科东风同志来信说，黑龙江省鹤岗市各工矿企业单位私自到吉林省的双井乡招走九百多人。由于大批劳动力外流，严重地影响农业生产。
    读者认为，我们国家的建设规模越来越大，劳动力的需要量一年比一年增多，因而，各单位就可能出现劳动力不足的情况。解决这个问题，主要是应该自力更生，改善劳动组织，开展技术革新运动，采取各种积极措施，大力挖掘本地的劳动潜力（比如组织职工家属参加生产）。在作了一切努力后仍不能解决问题时，争取外地支援招收一部分人员来补充，当然不是绝对不可以，但招收的办法，必须遵守国家劳动制度，不能乱招。
    读者希望各地劳动部门，加强劳动力招用和调配工作的管理，制止各单位乱招人员的混乱现象。
