A New Interpretation of "Indirect Aggression"
    Dong Fengya

Dulles seems to have come up with a new interpretation of "indirect aggression." He said this at a press conference on July 31.

Dulles told reporters that he had two plans for the summit conference of the major powers. To put it plainly, the first was to remove the label of aggression from the United States and Britain; the second was to pin the label of "indirect aggression" on the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic. In Dulles's own words, it was "on the one hand to eliminate the erroneous accusations that the United States and the United Kingdom are engaged in aggression in the Middle East. On the other hand, I think this conference will show the danger of indirect aggression that exists there and is often condemned by the United Nations." For Dulles, this calculation is naturally good, but "the cat licking a urine bubble" is also in vain!

"Regarding the aggression of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Middle East," this is an ironclad case forged by the soldiers of the "United States and the United Kingdom" landing in Lebanon and Jordan, driving airplanes, warships, and tanks, and carrying cannons and nuclear weapons. It is not due to anyone's "erroneous accusations." Therefore, it cannot be "eliminated." Can six or seven thousand soldiers and a large number of weapons and ammunition be "eliminated" by Dulles and Eisenhower's denial?

Speaking of "indirect aggression," it's a bit of a long story. The excuse for "the United States and the United Kingdom's aggression against the Middle East" is said to be to oppose "indirect aggression"; and also to protect the overseas Chinese under the threat of "indirect aggression." One argument is that the Iraqi revolution was the result of "indirect aggression." But according to the testimony of the American ambassador, the Republic of Iraq has done a good job in protecting American overseas Chinese, so it can be seen that American overseas Chinese are not threatened by any "indirect aggression"; now even the heroes who opposed "indirect aggression" have admitted the Republic of Iraq. On the one hand, sending troops to fight against "indirect aggression"; on the other hand, admitting that "indirect aggression" is legal and "accepting it," there is such a strange thing in the world!

Another argument is that "indirect aggression" is the foreign transportation of weapons to Lebanon to support "rebellion" or "foreign armed personnel entering this country," and so on. But according to the first report of the United Nations observer group, this threat does not exist; and according to the second report, in addition to the American armed personnel and weapons, no other armed personnel and weapons have entered Lebanon. It seems that the second interpretation of "indirect aggression" has been "eliminated" again.

Thus, only the most recent new interpretation remains. According to Dulles, it seems that the radio broadcasts of the United Arab Republic are this kind of "indirect aggression." This is what Dulles calls "stirring up internal struggles from the outside." Indeed: the United States and Britain send six or seven thousand troops, airplanes, cannons, and atomic bombs; what are they doing with such a menacing force? To attack the radio of the United Arab Republic. What a "grand and high-sounding" reason! I doubt how this can prove the "indirect aggression."

Instead, the American "Washington Post" provided the so-called "evidence of guilt" of the Cairo radio station, namely: "constantly spreading annoying Middle East news" and "noise." This is: "From the day the U.S. Marines landed in Beirut, he (referring to the Middle Eastern Arabs) has been hearing vivid reports about the US 'sending troops to Lebanon.'" "The radio station told the Arabs squatting on the ground listening to the radio, 'American imperialism is carrying out evil activities and aggression in Lebanon today.' It also said that it (referring to American imperialism) will suffer the same fate as British and French imperialism in Suez." "To Westerners, this sounds like a rampant hysterical attack, but to millions of Arabs, this is good news."

Then, the "evidence of guilt" provided by the "Washington Post" proves again what Dulles's so-called "indirect aggression" is all about. To sum it up: anything that exposes the truth of American and British aggression in the Middle East and hinders Western deceptive propaganda is "indirect aggression." However, I am worried for Dulles and Eisenhower, even if they prove the existence of this "indirect aggression" at the summit conference of the major powers, how can they "eliminate" their crimes of "engaging in aggression in the Middle East"?

    “间接侵略”新释
    董逢亚
    关于“间接侵略”，杜勒斯好像又有了新的解释。这是他在7月31日的记者招待会上说的。
    杜勒斯告诉记者们，他对大国首脑会议有两个打算。用最明白的话说，就是第一，摘掉美国和英国头上的侵略帽子；第二，给苏联和阿联扣上“间接侵略”的帽子。用杜勒斯的原话说，就是“一方面消除关于美国和联合王国在中东进行着侵略的那种错误的指责。另一方面，我认为这个会议将显示出那里存在的常常受到联合国谴责的间接侵略的危险。”对杜勒斯来说，这算盘打得自然不错，不过，“猫啃尿泡”也是空欢喜！
    “关于美国和联合王国在中东进行着侵略”，这是由“美国和联合王国”的士兵们，驾驶着飞机、军舰、坦克，携带了大炮和核武器在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆铸成的铁案。并非由于什么人“错误的指责”而生。因而，也无法“消除”得了。难道六、七万士兵和大量的武器弹药，也能因杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔的撒赖而“消除”吗？
    关于“间接侵略”的事，说起来就有些话长。“美国和联合王国对中东进行着侵略”的借口，据说就是为了反对“间接侵略”的；而且还要保护在“间接侵略”威胁下的侨民。有一种说法：伊拉克的革命就是“间接侵略”的结果。但据美国大使的证明，伊拉克共和国对于美国侨民保护的很好，可见美国侨民并不受什么“间接侵略”的威胁；如今是连反对“间接侵略”的英雄们自己也都已承认了伊拉克共和国。一面派大兵去要同“间接侵略”作战；一面却又承认“间接侵略”合法，而且“接受了它”，天下就有这等的怪事！
    还有一种说法：“间接侵略”就是外国运武器到黎巴嫩支持“叛乱”或者说是“外国武装人员进入这个国家”等等。但据联合国观察团的第一次报告说，并不存在这种威胁；更据第二次报告说，除了美国的武装人员和武器以外，也再没有其他的武装人员和武器进入黎巴嫩，看来“间接侵略”的第二种解释，又被“消除”了。
    于是，只剩了最近的一种新解释。据杜勒斯说，好像阿拉伯联合共和国的无线电广播，就是这种“间接侵略”。这就是杜勒斯所说的“从外界煽动内部斗争”。正是：美英出兵六、七万，飞机、大炮、原子弹；气势汹汹欲何为？要打阿联无线电。多么“冠冕堂皇”的理由啊！我倒怀疑用这怎能证明出“间接侵略”来。
    倒是美国的“华盛顿邮报”，提供了开罗电台的所谓“罪证”名曰：“经常散布讨厌的中东消息”和“噪音”。这就是：“从美国海军陆战队在贝鲁特登陆的这一天起，他（指中东阿拉伯人）就一直听到关于美国‘派兵到黎巴嫩’的有声有色的报道。”“电台向蹲在地上听广播的阿拉伯人说，‘美帝国主义今天到黎巴嫩进行罪恶活动和侵略’。它还说，它（指美帝国主义）将遭到英法帝国主义在苏伊士所遭遇的同样命运。”“在西方人听来，这像是猖獗的歇斯底里的发作，但是在千百万阿拉伯人听来，这是福音。”
    那末，“华盛顿邮报”提供的“罪证”，不就又证明着杜勒斯所指责的“间接侵略”是怎样一回事。概括地说：凡是揭破美英侵略中东的真像，而又妨碍着西方的欺骗宣传的，都是“间接侵略”。不过，我倒替杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔耽心，即使是在大国首脑会议上证明了这种“间接侵略”的存在，可又怎样能“消除”他们“在中东进行着侵略”的罪行呢？
