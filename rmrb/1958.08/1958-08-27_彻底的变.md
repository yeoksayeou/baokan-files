　　A Thorough Transformation
　　He Zuo
　　The wheat yield per mu in farmers' experimental fields has reached as high as 5,000 or 7,000 jin, while the yield in the experimental fields of higher agricultural institutions is far lower than that of the farmers. The rice yield per mu in farmers’ experimental fields has reached as high as 30,000 or 40,000 jin, while the yield in the experimental fields of agricultural institutions is even far lower than that of the farmers. It is evident that having only book knowledge and lacking practical production experience inevitably lags far behind reality. For example, books say that deep plowing will disrupt the soil layers and affect crop growth, but the experience of farmers in Changge County, Henan Province, and other places in deep plowing the land proves that it not only does not affect crop growth but also achieves a bumper harvest. Books say that applying more than 7,000 jin of fertilizer to wheat will cause lodging, and sowing more than 30 jin of seeds per mu of wheat will reduce production. Advanced agricultural production experiences in many regions of our country have also negated this theory.
　　In production practice, farmers have put forward many new experiences through bold creations and innovations in the transformation of nature, such as deep plowing, fertilization, irrigation, seed selection, and field management. These experiences need to be explained theoretically and further studied. For example, how to optimize close planting, how to fertilize rationally, how to rationally transform the soil, how to irrigate and drain rationally, and how to conduct field management rationally, and so on. The research and solution of these problems are of great significance to the development of agricultural production in our country, the reform of the teaching content, teaching methods, and scientific research work of higher agricultural institutions, and the improvement of the quality of education.
　　Now, Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College have taken a firm measure to send all faculty, staff, and students to the countryside to work for a year, seek advice from production practice, seek advice from farmers, and take those who are capable as teachers. This is a good way to closely integrate education and production, learning and labor, theory and practice, and it is also a good way to promote agricultural science in our country; this can be said to be a thorough transformation.
　　Some people may doubt whether this is a disregard for theoretical education? We say that this is the only way to enrich theory and improve the level of theory. Chairman Mao said that students and teachers should both work diligently and study industriously, and they must use their hands. It is not good if they do not use their hands. In this way, they can transform nature and transform themselves in production labor. We welcome the measures taken by Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College, and we hope that all teachers and students of these two schools can learn from the masses in labor, be students of the masses, and strive to transform themselves. At the same time, they should summarize the experiences in production with the masses, systematize them, and then compile these knowledge into new teaching materials for teaching, so as to improve the quality of teaching, greatly improve the level of agricultural science in our country, and then guide agricultural production and promote agricultural production.

　　彻底的变
　　何作
    农民种的小麦试验田亩产已高达五千、七千斤了，而高等农业院校小麦试验田的产量却远远低于农民；农民种的水稻试验田亩产已高达三万、四万多斤，而农业院校的试验田产量更远远低于农民。可见只有书本知识，缺乏生产实践，势必远远落后于实际。例如，书本上说，深翻土地会打乱土层影响作物的生长，但是河南省长葛县等地农民深翻土地的经验证明，不但没影响作物的生长，反而取得了丰收；书上说小麦施肥超过七千斤会造成倒伏，小麦每亩地播的种子超过三十斤就会减产，我国许多地区先进的农业生产经验也否定了这种学说。
    农民在生产实践中，经过对自然的变革，如深耕、施肥、灌溉、选种、田间管理等方面的许多大胆创造革新，已经提出了许多新的经验。这些经验，需要从理论上加以阐释，需要进一步地去研究。例如密植怎样最适宜，如何合理地施肥，合理地进行土壤改造，合理地灌溉排水，合理地进行田间管理等等。对于这些问题的研究和解决，对发展我国的农业生产、改革高等农业院校的教学内容、教学方法和科学研究工作以及提高教育质量都有重大的意义。
    现在，北京农业大学和北京农业机械化学院采取一个坚决措施，将学校的全体教职人员、学生下放农村劳动一年，向生产实际求教，向农民求教，拜能者为师。这是教育和生产、学习和劳动、理论和实际密切相结合的好办法，也是推进我国农业科学的好办法；这可以说是一个彻底的改变。
    有人可能怀疑这是不是轻视理论教育呢？我们说，这是丰富理论、提高理论水平的必由途径。毛主席说，无论学生和教师，都要勤工俭学，都要动动手，不动手也不好。这样，才能在生产劳动中去变革自然也变革自己。我们欢迎北京农业大学和北京农业机械化学院的措施，我们希望这两个学校的全体师生能够在劳动中向群众学习，作群众的学生，努力改造自己。同时和群众在一起总结生产中的经验并加以系统化，再把这些知识编成新教材来进行教学，以提高教学质量，把我国的农业科学水平大大地提高一步，进而指导农业生产，推进农业生产。
