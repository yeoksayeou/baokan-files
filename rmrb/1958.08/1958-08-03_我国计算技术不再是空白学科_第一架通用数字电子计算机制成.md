Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: China's first small general-purpose digital electronic computer was successfully manufactured last night with Soviet technical assistance. It is installed at the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. It was made through the cooperation of the Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing Wire Factory, and other relevant units. This research achievement marks the beginning of the establishment of computing technology, a blank field in our country.

This general-purpose digital electronic computer, named "August 1st" type, is composed of tens of thousands of parts, including nearly four thousand semiconductor germanium diodes and eight hundred electron tubes. Its manufacturing and adjustment process is much more difficult and complex than that of analog electronic computers; its range of use is much wider than that of analog electronic computers, and the accuracy of calculation results is far better than that of analog electronic computers, reaching nine digits. Analog computers can only reach three digits.

This type of general-purpose digital electronic computer can perform calculations of large amounts of data and complex problems. The computer now installed in the Institute of Computing Technology is preparing to solve the calculation problems of many topics, such as research programs for short-term numerical weather forecasts (much more accurate than ordinary weather forecasts), geodetic adjustment problems, dam stress analysis, unstable riverbed flow, calculations in aerodynamics, and other engineering designs. These problems cannot be solved by analog electronic computers.

    我国计算技术不再是空白学科
    第一架通用数字电子计算机制成
    新华社2日讯　国产第一架小型通用数字电子计算机在苏联的技术援助下昨晚制成。它安装在北京中国科学院计算技术研究所里。它是计算技术研究所、北京有线电厂和其他有关单位合作制成的。这项研究成果标志着我国计算技术这门空白学科已经开始建立起来。
    这架命名为“八一”型的通用数字电子计算机由几万个零件构成，其中包括近四千个半导体锗二级管和八百个电子管。它的制造和调整过程比模拟电子计算机要困难复杂得多；它的使用范围比模拟电子计算机广泛得多，计算结果的精确度远胜于模拟电子计算机，可以达到九位数字。而模拟计算机只能达到三位。
    这一类型的通用数字电子计算机可以进行大量数据及复杂问题的计算。现在安装在计算技术研究所的这架计算机正在准备解决许多题目的计算问题，如短期天气数值预报（比普通天气预报要精确得多）的研究方案，大地测量平差问题，水坝应力分析，河床不稳定流，空气动力学等方面的计算和其他工程设计。这些问题都是模拟电子计算机所不能解决的。
