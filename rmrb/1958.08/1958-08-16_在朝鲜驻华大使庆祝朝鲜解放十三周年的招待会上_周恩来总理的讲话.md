Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the reception hosted by the Korean Ambassador to China to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea by the Soviet Army is as follows:

Respected Deputy Premier Comrade, Ambassador Comrade, Comrades, Friends:

Today we gather here to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the Korean people's liberation with the assistance of the great Soviet Red Army, I, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, extend warm congratulations to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people, congratulate the Korean people on the great achievements they have made in the cause of building socialism and defending peace in the Far East and the world, and congratulate the continuous strengthening and development of the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

The Chinese and Korean people fought side by side, cutting off the clutches of the American aggressors reaching towards us, and jointly guarding the eastern front of the socialist camp. Now, our two countries are also advancing hand in hand in the rapidly developing cause of socialist construction. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The joint statement of our two governments on February 19 this year embodies the deep friendship between our two peoples and our firm confidence in jointly safeguarding peace. The fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to withdraw from Korea eloquently demonstrates to the world the sincerity of the Chinese and Korean people for the cause of peace.

However, the actions of the US government completely violate the wishes of peace-loving countries and peoples. It refuses to withdraw its troops from Korea and obstructs the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. It occupies China's territory of Taiwan and is hostile to the Chinese people. The US government recently, on the one hand, together with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, intensified the tension in the Far East, and on the other hand, reiterated its so-called policy of non-recognition of the People's Republic of China, repeating the platitudes about "communist aggression" to intimidate the people of Asia and Africa. In fact, China has never been interested in the recognition of the United States. No matter what sophistry the US government engages in, it cannot conceal the bankruptcy of its policy towards China, nor can it conceal its aggression and intervention against many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the guise of anti-communism. The United States' insistence on being hostile to the Chinese and Korean people in the Far East and creating tension in the world can never achieve its desired goals. On the contrary, it will make us more vigilant against the US's aggressive schemes, make peace-loving countries and peoples see the imperialist face of the United States more clearly, and will ultimately lead to the bankruptcy and failure of the US's aggressive policy.

Recently, the United States, in collusion with Britain, launched an armed invasion against the Arab people. Until now, the US and British invading troops are still entrenched in the territories of Lebanon and Jordan. The war clouds over the Middle East have not yet dissipated. All peace-loving countries and peoples in the world demand that the United States and Britain withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The Soviet Union has already put forward corresponding proposals at the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly based on this general demand. We fully support the solemn position of the Soviet Union. We believe that if the United Nations does not want to continue to diminish its prestige in the eyes of the people of the world, the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly should, in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, earnestly assume the solemn responsibility of preventing aggression and safeguarding peace. Regardless of the outcome of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly, no matter how US President Eisenhower sophistically defends, intimidates, or deceives, the US and British invading troops must completely withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. The Chinese and Korean people, from their own experience, understand that as long as the people of all countries persist in their struggle, imperialist aggression can certainly be defeated, and the just struggle to safeguard national independence and world peace will surely be victorious.

Comrades, Friends, I propose:

    For the prosperity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
    For the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people,
    For the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For world peace,
    For the health of the Korean leading comrades headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung,
    Cheers!

    在朝鲜驻华大使庆祝朝鲜解放十三周年的招待会上
　　周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社15日讯　周恩来总理在朝鲜驻华大使为庆祝苏联军队解放朝鲜十三周年举行的招待会上的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的副首相同志，大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天我们欢聚在一起庆祝朝鲜人民在伟大苏联红军援助下获得解放的十三周年纪念日，我代表中国政府和中国人民，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民表示热烈的祝贺，祝贺朝鲜人民在建设社会主义和捍卫远东和世界和平的事业中所获得的巨大成就，祝贺中朝两国人民的团结和友谊不断加强和不断发展。
    中朝两国人民并肩作战，斩断了美国侵略者伸向我们的魔手，共同守卫着社会主义阵营的东方前线。现在，我们两国又在飞跃发展的社会主义建设事业中携手并进。中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争。中朝两国政府今年2月19日的联合声明体现了我们两国人民的深厚友谊和共同维护和平的坚定信心。中国人民志愿军主动撤离朝鲜的事实向全世界雄辩地说明了中朝两国人民对于和平事业的诚意。
    但是，美国政府的行为却完全违反爱好和平的国家和人民的愿望。它拒绝从朝鲜撤兵，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。它侵占中国的领土台湾，敌视中国人民。美国政府最近一方面同蒋介石集团一起，加剧远东的紧张局势，另一方面又重申它的所谓不承认中华人民共和国的政策，重弹关于“共产主义侵略”的滥调来恐吓亚非人民，其实，中国从来就对美国的承认不感兴趣，美国政府不论进行怎样的诡辩，也掩盖不了它的对华政策的破产，也掩盖不了它在反共的幌子下对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多国家的侵略和干涉。美国在远东坚持敌视中朝人民、在全世界制造紧张局势的做法，绝不可能达到它所期望的目的，相反地却会使我们对美国的侵略阴谋更加提高警惕，使爱好和平的国家和人民更加看清美国的帝国主义面目，最后必将导致美国侵略政策的破产和失败。
    最近，美国又伙同英国对阿拉伯人民发动了武装侵略。直到目前，美英侵略军队还盘踞在黎巴嫩和约旦的领土上。笼罩着中近东的战争阴云还没有消散。全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民都要求美国和英国从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军队。苏联已经根据这种普遍的要求在联合国大会紧急特别会议上提出了相应的提案。我们完全支持苏联的严正立场。我们认为，如果联合国不想使自己的威信在世界人民的面前继续低落下去，联合国大会紧急特别会议就应该根据联合国宪章的精神，切实负起制止侵略、保卫和平的庄严责任。不管联合国大会紧急特别会议的结果怎样，不管美国总统艾森豪威尔怎样狡辩、恐吓和哄骗，美英侵略军队必须完全撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。中朝人民从他们的切身经验体会到，只要各国人民坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略是一定可以打退的，维护民族独立和世界和平的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。
    同志们，朋友们，我建议：
    为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的繁荣，
    为中朝两国人民亲如手足的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为以金日成同志为首的朝鲜领导同志的健康，
    干杯！
