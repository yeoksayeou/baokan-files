Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 4th: Shaanxi Province is showing great enthusiasm in achieving ball bearingization. Following the telephone conference convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the evening of the 28th of last month, a wave of ball bearingization immediately swept across more than one hundred counties and cities in the province. In just three or four days, thirty counties and cities successfully trial-produced ball bearings. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in Sanyuan and Gaoling counties have already universally produced balls. The suburbs of Xi'an City produced three thousand sets of ball bearings in two days. Within a day or two after the provincial Party committee's telephone conference, Wugong County established a ball bearing factory and produced six hundred sets of ball bearings, fitting ball bearings onto one hundred and eighty-one agricultural implements. The ball bearings manufactured by the indigenous methods in Baishui County reached a hardness of 57 degrees, with very good quality, and each ball cost only 1.5 fen.

The experience of Shaanxi Province in carrying out the agricultural tool improvement movement has proven that it can be done well if the Party committee takes action, mobilizes the masses, seizes some new agricultural tools of universal significance, works hard, works extra hard, and works more, and forms a mass movement in a short period of time; otherwise, it cannot be done well with little work, less work, and slow work. Sanyuan County had manufactured and used ball bearings a long time ago, but because it did not create a mass movement to promote them, it remained at one point. For this reason, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to launch a mass movement to promote ball bearings. In addition to continuing to hold meetings, it also made a red flag and launched a competition among the counties to seize the red flag and achieve ball bearingization. The Provincial Committee established a leading group to specifically guide this work.

After receiving instructions from the Provincial Committee, Party organizations at all levels, with the Party Secretary personally taking charge, immediately made arrangements. Six counties planned to achieve ball bearingization in seven to fifteen days; thirty counties planned to complete it in about twenty days. In many counties, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee and several members led this work. Some Party Secretaries personally went to the masses and discussed with them.

In the process of achieving ball bearingization, various forces in Shaanxi Province were fully mobilized, using both indigenous and foreign methods, manufacturing everything that could be manufactured. In places such as Xianyang County, agricultural cooperatives produced ball bearings with only a hammer, an anvil, and a stove. All state-owned factories, handicraft cooperatives, tractor stations, and school practice factories also participated in the movement to manufacture ball bearings and support agriculture. In Huayin County, some old factories built a ball bearing factory composed of twenty people in half a day on the afternoon of July 29th. The Xianyang County Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Plant proposed to "work hard for fifteen days to manufacture ten thousand sets of ball bearings to support agricultural cooperatives in achieving ball bearingization."

After the masses were mobilized, many difficulties were solved easily. When there was no raw material, the masses in Xingping County launched a movement to contribute one jin of iron per person. In six days, the county's 280,000 people contributed 164,000 jin of iron and 5,800 jin of steel, basically solving the raw material problem. The Yan'an Machinery Factory, lacking a grinder in manufacturing ball bearings, used a lathe instead; lacking cutting tools, changed pointed knives to round-mouth knives; lacking steel, workers picked out steel materials such as rear axles from automobiles from waste materials, and finally overcame numerous difficulties and trial-produced two types of ball bearings. The Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately organized various counties to visit and learn from them, and within a short period of time, each county was able to manufacture ball bearings.

After preliminary promotion of ball bearings in many places in Shaanxi Province, production efficiency has been greatly improved. After installing ball bearings on waterwheels in Hongqi Township, Xianyang County, the labor force was reduced by half. After installing ball bearings on pushcarts, the work efficiency was twice as high as before. Based on this, it is estimated that after ball bearingization of the entire county, 60,000 laborers can be turned into 180,000 laborers. Originally, there was a shortage of labor this year for deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, but after realizing ball bearingization, not only is there no shortage, but there is a surplus.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 4th: Heilongjiang Province will basically realize semi-mechanization of agricultural tools before the end of November this year, and some agricultural cooperatives will realize mechanization. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all localities to launch a new upsurge in the agricultural tool reform movement again. The specific requirements of this agricultural tool reform movement upsurge are: not only all transportation tools (including vehicles, mills, and some irrigation and drainage tools) must be equipped with ball bearings, but also tillage tools must be wheeled and equipped with ball bearings.

Currently, seven counties in the province have successfully trial-produced ball bearings using indigenous methods. Harbin City, which has a ball bearing factory, and its four subordinate counties are building new factories under the guidance and assistance of large state-owned ball bearing factories, and the city and its four subordinate counties will realize bearingization in August.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also requires all localities to create and promote compound, comprehensive, and lightweight agricultural tools, that is, the reformed agricultural tools can be used in parallel in several sets, can be multi-purpose, and must be lightweight. At present, agricultural cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have purchased more than 1,000 tractors, which should be appropriately combined with machine plows and improved agricultural tools, so that at least 2.5 million mu of land can be plowed this autumn.

### 多造滚珠轴承为农具添翼  陕西黑龙江两省发动群众大干特干多干

    多造滚珠轴承为农具添翼
    陕西黑龙江两省发动群众大干特干多干
    新华社西安4日电　陕西省各地为实现滚珠轴承化的劲头很大。上月28日晚中共陕西省委召开了电话会议以后，滚珠轴承化的浪潮立即席卷全省一百多个县、市。仅三四天时间，三十个县、市就试制成功滚珠轴承。三原、高陵等县的绝大部分农业社已经普遍生产滚珠。西安市郊区在两天内已经生产出三千套滚珠轴承。武功县在省委电话会议后一两天内即成立了一个滚珠轴承工厂，并生产出六百套滚珠轴承，给一百八十一件农具安上滚珠。白水县用土法制造的滚珠硬度达到五十七度，质量很好，每颗珠子只合一分五厘钱。
    陕西省搞农具改良运动的经验证明，凡是党委动手，发动群众，抓住一些有普遍意义的新农具，大干、特干、多干，并在短期内形成群众运动的就能干好；否则小干、少干、慢干就干不好。三原县很早以前就制造和使用了滚珠轴承，但由于没有造成群众运动去推广，所以一直停留在一个点上。为此，中共陕西省委决定大搞群众运动来推广滚珠轴承。除了继续召开会议外，还做了一面红旗，发动各县展开争夺红旗实现滚珠轴承化的竞赛。省委成立了领导小组，专门指导这一工作。
    各级党组织在接到省委的指示后，党委书记亲自挂帅，立即进行布置。六个县计划在七天到十五天实现滚珠轴承化；三十个县计划在二十天左右完成。许多县都是县委第一书记和好几个委员领导这一工作。有的党委书记亲自到群众中和群众一起商量。
    陕西省各地在实现滚珠轴承化中，充分动员了各种力量，土、洋一齐干，所有能制造的都制造。咸阳县等地农业社都是只有一把铁锤、砧子和一个火炉，就生产出滚珠轴承。所有国营工厂、手工业社、拖拉机站、学校实习工厂，也都参加了制造滚珠轴承的运动，支援农业。华阴县一些老工厂在7月29日下午用半天时间，建起了一个二十人组成的滚珠轴承厂。咸阳县农具制造厂提出“苦战十五天制成一万套滚珠轴承，支援农业社实现滚珠轴承化”。
    群众发动起来以后，许多困难迎刃而解。没有原料，兴平县群众开展一人献一斤铁的运动。全县二十八万人六天内就献出十六万四千斤铁，五千八百斤钢，原料问题基本上得到解决。延安机械厂在制造滚珠轴承中没有磨床，就用车床代替；没有刀具，把尖刀改为圆口刀；没有钢，职工们在废料中拣出汽车上的后轴等钢材，终于克服了重重困难，试制成两种滚珠轴承。中共延安地委立即组织各县参观学习，短期间内各县都能制造滚珠轴承了。
    陕西省许多地方在初步推广滚珠轴承后，生产效率大大提高。咸阳县红旗乡在水车上安装滚珠轴承后，减少了一半人力。架子车上安装上滚珠轴承后，工作效率比过去提高两倍。由此推算，全县滚珠轴承化以后，六万个劳力就可变成十八万个劳力，原来今年深耕细作，劳力感到很缺乏，而实现滚珠轴承化后，不但不缺乏，反倒有富裕了。
    新华社哈尔滨4日电　黑龙江省将在今年11月底以前，基本实现农具半机械化，一部分农业社实现机械化。中共黑龙江省委已指示各地，再次掀起一个农具改革运动的新高潮。这次农具改革运动高潮的具体要求是：不但所有的运转工具（包括车辆、碾磨和一些排灌工具）都要装上滚珠轴承，耕作农具也要轮子化并加滚珠轴承。
    现在全省已有七个县用土办法试制成功滚珠轴承，有滚珠轴承工厂的哈尔滨市和所属的四个县，正在国营大型滚珠轴承厂指导帮助下办新厂，在8月内全市和所属四县实现轴承化。
    中共黑龙江省委还要求各地创造和推广复式、综合、轻便的农具，即改革出的农具能够并列几台使用，能够一具多用，而且要轻便。目前，黑龙江省由农业社买去的拖拉机已经有一千多台，要和机器犁和改良农具适当结合使用，就能在今年秋季至少翻地二百五十万亩。（附图片）
