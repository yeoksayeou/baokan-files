Wuhu Builds Train Ferry

    The new Wuhu Train Ferry project simultaneously commenced construction on both banks of the Yangtze River in Wuhu City on the 10th. It is another water transportation trunk line connecting the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, in addition to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the Nanjing Train Ferry.

    This ferry project will connect the Huainan Railway line north of the river from Shenjiaxiang across the river to the Ningwu Railway, with a total length of thirty-four li. The project includes marshalling yards, locomotive dismantling sections, station bridges, and stations. It is expected to be delivered for use in October of this year.

    The completion of the Wuhu Yangtze River Ferry will connect the Huainan and Ningwu railways north and south of the river, which will increase the transportation capacity of the Huainan Railway by more than one time, and will greatly reduce the transportation tension of the Jinpu Railway, and greatly accelerate the exchange of materials between the north and south of the river.

　　芜湖修火车轮渡
    芜湖火车轮渡新建工程10日在芜湖市对江两岸同时动工。它是除武汉长江大桥、南京火车轮渡外，沟通长江南北两岸的又一水上运输干线。
    这个轮渡工程将从江北淮南铁路线沈家巷过江接通宁芜铁路，全长三十四华里。工程包括编组场、机务拆散段、站桥、车站等。预计今年10月份就可交付使用。
    芜湖长江轮渡建成，将大江南北的淮南、宁芜两铁路连接起来后，将使淮南铁路运输能力提高一倍以上，对减轻津浦铁路的运输紧张状况有极大作用，大江南北物资对流将大大加速。
