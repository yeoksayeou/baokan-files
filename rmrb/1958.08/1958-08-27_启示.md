　　Inspiration
　　There used to be a saying, "Failure is the mother of success." The example of Pingyang is the best illustration of this saying.

　　However, this does not mean that as long as you "fail" once, you will definitely achieve "success" later. In fact, the same failure does not elicit the same reaction. Some people, after failing, take this failure as a spur to themselves. After a period of struggle, they can naturally achieve success. Others, after failing, treat this failure as a heavy burden, becoming dejected and unable to recover, and naturally their hope of success becomes slim.

　　Conversely, victory is a good thing, but if one is not vigilant, this good thing can sometimes become the seed of bad things. Yishan District in Pingyang County was an "800-jin district" during the county-wide production competition failure last year; however, this year it has fallen behind in the county-wide bumper harvest.

　　Of course, this does not mean that after winning once, one must become a backward example. If one can avoid arrogance and impatience after victory and continue to move forward, one will naturally not fall behind. But if one becomes arrogant and complacent after victory, how can one guarantee not falling behind?

　　The news from Pingyang gives us inspiration: When we fail, don't be discouraged; when we win, don't be arrogant.

　　启示
    过去有一句话，叫做“失败是成功之母”，平阳的事例就是这句话的最好说明。
    但是，这并不是说，只要先来“失败”一下，以后一定可以获得“成功”。其实，同样的失败，并不会引起同样的反应。有的人失败了，把这种失败当做对自己的鞭策，经过一段时间的奋斗，自然可以获得成功。有的人失败了，把这种失败当做沉重的包袱，从此垂头丧气，一蹶不振，自然成功的希望也就渺茫了。
    相反，胜利是好事，如果不自警惕，这种好事有时也会成为坏事的根苗。平阳县宜山区，在去年全县生产竞赛失败当中，曾经是八百斤区；可是，今年在全县丰收当中反而落后了。
    当然，这也并不是说，胜利一次之后，一定要变成落后的典型。胜利了，能够不骄不躁，继续前进，自然就不会落后。如果胜利了，骄傲自满起来，怎能保证不落后呢？
    平阳的新闻给了我们启示，这就是：失败了，不气馁；胜利了，不骄傲。
