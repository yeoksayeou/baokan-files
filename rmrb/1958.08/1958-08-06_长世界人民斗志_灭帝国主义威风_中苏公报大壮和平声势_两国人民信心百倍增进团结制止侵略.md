From the afternoon of the 3rd, when the communiqué was issued, it aroused great attention among the people throughout the country. From cities to the countryside, from the interior to the border regions, people everywhere are reading and discussing this communiqué. People from all walks of life in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Xi'an have held meetings and forums. Newspapers in many cities published special editions of the communiqué, and these special editions were snatched up by pedestrians as soon as they appeared on the streets. After buying the special editions, people read and promoted them, and suddenly the streets and alleys were filled with discussions about the communiqué.

On the evening of the 3rd, Harbin was holding a garden party for "Making Great Efforts in the Technological Revolution and the Cultural Revolution." When the more than 40 loudspeakers in the venue simultaneously broadcast the content of the communiqué, the more than 30,000 people participating in the event immediately stopped all activities and listened attentively. From the evening of the 3rd to noon on the 4th, more than one million people in Harbin had listened to or read the communiqué. People from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City held a grand meeting of 3,000 people on the afternoon of the 5th.

People also unanimously believed that this communiqué will play an extremely important role in stopping war and maintaining world peace. The auto workers of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, who had just successfully trial-produced the "Red Flag" high-end sedan, were very excited after seeing the Sino-Soviet communiqué. They said that this communiqué has great significance for defending world peace and opposing imperialist aggression. Li Zengxiu, a 67-year-old farmer from the Shuimo Agricultural Cooperative in Shuimo Township, Xining City, sang about the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union: "The communiqué is like a red sun, shining on all parts of the world; imperialism is like frost on the grass, provoking war is self-destruction."

This communiqué greatly boosted the morale of the people across the country to oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace. People expressed that we love peace, but we are not afraid of war. If imperialism insists on launching a war, we will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate it and lay the foundation for permanent world peace. Zhang Pimou, a former anti-traitor hero from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region who is currently in Yan'an participating in the Shaanbei Construction Conference, Lin Zhenming and Xie Fa, militia activists from Fujian Province, Bang Dewen, a Dai student from Yunnan Nationalities Institute, and Wei Zhengke, a Zhuang worker from the Nanning Nationalities Printing Factory, pointed out at forums held in their respective regions: If the US and British warmongers do not accept the solemn warning in the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union and immediately withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East, they will inevitably suffer the consequences; if they dare to undermine peace, we will send them to the grave.

People from all over the country also expressed their willingness to respond to the call of the communiqué with practical actions. Workers and peasants in Changsha, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Xining, Urumqi and other places, as well as more than 800 representatives who were participating in the Second Guangdong Provincial Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists in Xinhui County, revised their industrial and grain production increase targets after discussing the Sino-Soviet communiqué.

For the past two days, the Soviet people have been reading the historically significant communiqué word by word, and radio broadcasters have been reporting the results of the meeting over and over again in excited voices.

Shop workers and work teams at the Ilyich factory have read the communiqué and held discussions. Foreman Gerasimov said, "We all think this is a very important thing. This meeting proves that the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, are determined to prevent a new war by all means." Worker Brusentsov said, "This important document is a powerful blow to aggressive plans. The fact that the Communist Parties of China and the Soviet Union have completely consistent views on all issues concerning peace and the fight against aggressors is of great significance. This is a serious warning to war instigators." Foreman Palagin said that the communiqué would inspire all good people to fight for peace. He said, "War cannot scare us. We love peace, but we are not afraid of threats. If the aggressors want to start a war, the countries and people who love peace and freedom will completely destroy the imperialist aggressors."

Personnel from government agencies, enterprises, and scientific research institutions in Leningrad have all discussed the document. At a meeting held at the Red Viborg factory, worker Dubinin said that the people of Leningrad unanimously support the communiqué. The development of the situation in the Middle East and other parts of the world shows that the national liberation movement is unstoppable. The era of colonialism is gone forever.

The Sino-Soviet communiqué has brought new strength and confidence.
