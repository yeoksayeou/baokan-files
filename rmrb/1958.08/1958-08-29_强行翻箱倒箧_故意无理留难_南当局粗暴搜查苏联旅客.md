Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 28th:

"Pravda" published a satirical article today, exposing the unreasonable searches conducted by the Yugoslav authorities on Soviet passengers.

The article said that on the evening of August 8th this year, at Subotica railway station in Yugoslavia, four Yugoslavs boarded the train that was stopped at the station and conducted a five-hour search of Soviet citizens traveling on the train. They entered the compartment of a Soviet female citizen and her seven-year-old daughter, opened their luggage, and searched their belongings. Subsequently, a female inspector locked the Soviet female citizen in the room and conducted a "personal search" on her. The inspectors also searched other Soviet passengers from head to toe, and carefully examined their bunks from top to bottom. One inspector even broke open the Soviet passengers' bread to see if anything was hidden inside.

The Yugoslav authorities also carried out similar inspections on Soviet ships sailing on the Danube. During the inspection, they did not spare the luggage of the Soviet crew members, even the fire water pipes on the ship. At the port of Vukovar on the Danube, Soviet crew members had to register with the Yugoslav authorities upon arrival. In the port of Belgrade, the relevant departments even made special cards for Soviet guests, with a special item for so-called "political reliability." The port authorities and police also made special regulations regarding meetings between Yugoslav citizens and Soviet sailors. According to this regulation, all Yugoslav citizens who wish to visit Soviet ships must first obtain permission from the Yugoslav police before going on board. After the visit, they must also go to the police to report everything they saw and heard on the ship.

On May 30th this year, when the Soviet ship "Irkutsk" arrived at the Yugoslav port of Veliko Gradište, the representative of the port authority even asked the captain of the Soviet ship to allow them to inspect the safe on the ship. This request was immediately rejected, and as a result, the ship was detained by the Yugoslav authorities in the port for thirteen hours.

### 强行翻箱倒箧　故意无理留难  南当局粗暴搜查苏联旅客

　　强行翻箱倒箧　故意无理留难
    南当局粗暴搜查苏联旅客
    新华社莫斯科28日电　“真理报”今天发表了一篇杂文，揭露南斯拉夫当局对苏联旅客进行的无理搜查。
    这篇文章说，今年8月8日晚间，在南斯拉夫境内苏布的萨火车站上，有四个南斯拉夫人登上了当时正停在车站上的列车，对搭乘这列火车的苏联公民进行了长达五小时的搜查。他们走进一位苏联女公民和她的七岁的女儿的车厢房间，翻开她们的箱物，把她们的行李搜查了一遍。随后，又有一个女检查员把这位苏联女公民锁在房间，对她进行了“个人检查”。检查人员还对其他苏联乘客从头到脚进行了搜查，并且上上下下仔细检查了他们的铺位。有一个检查人员甚至把苏联乘客的面包掰开，看看面包心内藏有什么东西没有。
    南斯拉夫当局对航行在多瑙河上的苏联船只也进行同样的检查。检查时，他们对苏联船员的行李直到船上的消防用水管都不放过。在多瑙河上的武科瓦尔港，苏联船员一到达就必须向南斯拉夫当局登记。在贝尔格莱德港，有关部门甚至为苏联客人做了专门卡片，卡片上专门有所谓“政治可靠性”一项。港口当局和警察机关对南斯拉夫公民和苏联海员的会见也作了特别的规定。按照这个规定，所有希望到苏联船上作客的南斯拉夫公民在到苏联船上以前，都必须先得到南斯拉夫警察机关的许可。在作客完了以后，他们还必须再去警察机关报告他们在船上所见所闻的一切。
    今年5月30日，当苏联轮船“伊尔库次克”号到达南斯拉夫维利科—格腊迪什特港时，港口当局代表甚至要求这艘苏联轮船的船长准许他们检查轮船上的保险柜。这个要求当即被拒绝了，结果，这艘轮船在港口就被南斯拉夫当局留难达十三小时。
