Breaking Regional Boundaries, Stepping Outside Industry Circles
Two Million People in Zhejiang Support Agricultural Production

(Our Correspondent Li Xinmin reports) Zhejiang Province is currently in the midst of a tense season of harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice, and has also encountered a prolonged drought. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice and realize the leap forward plan of "late rice surpassing early rice and doubling the yield," more than two million people across the province are holding high the red flag of Communism and throwing themselves into supporting the rush to harvest and plant, as well as the fight against drought. This support army includes workers, government cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, literary and artistic workers, medical personnel, school teachers and students, urban residents, and so on. In particular, it includes a significant number of farmers. Due to differences in regions, differences in crop maturity, differences in crop types, and differences in the degree of labor shortage, manpower and materials have been drawn from the mountains to the plains, from cotton and hemp areas to rice areas, from the ocean to the land, from areas with better water conservancy to areas severely affected by drought, and from areas with later seasons to earlier areas to help rush harvest, rush planting, and fight drought.

In the great communist collaboration of agricultural production, regional boundaries have been broken, and an unprecedented situation of unity has emerged between cities and villages, industry and agriculture, and between special districts, counties, townships, and communes, with mutual support and mutual adjustment of manpower and materials.

In the agricultural cooperatives along the banks of the lower reaches of the Qiantang River in Xiaoshan, Haining, Haiyan, and other areas where economic crops such as cotton and ramie are the main production activities, a large number of laborers were sent to rice-producing areas to help with the rush to harvest and plant. Some cotton and hemp areas also received support from rice-producing areas in the form of water pumps to fight drought and protect seedlings. In the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang and the mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Jinhua, Jiande, and other special districts, manpower was organized to support the plain rice areas by carrying plows, seeds, or farm tools, because the rice area was smaller, the season was later, or the labor force was less strained than in the plain areas. In order to help the drought-stricken Quantian Township, the members of the agricultural cooperative in Futian Township, Yiwu County, let the water in their reservoir irrigate Quantian Township. They organized one hundred waterwheels, crossed thirteen mountains, and continuously pumped water from Da Hongli into the fields. Many counties, townships, and communes that were competing with each other were providing mutual support while competing. Jiaxing County received support from more than 3,000 laborers from Jiashan and Wuxing counties, which were competing with it, greatly accelerating the rush to harvest and plant.

Cities have supported the countryside with a large amount of manpower and materials. In Hangzhou alone, there was a voluntary labor force of 50,000 people going to the countryside to help with the rush to harvest and plant. The commercial departments of Jiaxing Special District had an average of 2,480 peddler's loads and more than 15,000 commercial personnel delivering goods to the countryside, purchasing door-to-door, and participating in the rush to harvest, plant, and fight drought. The staff of theatrical troupes, film teams, ballad singing and other cultural groups went deep into the fields, worked, publicized, sang, and created, taking materials locally, performing on the spot, singing the praises of advanced figures, and singing the praises of the harvest. Teachers and students at all levels of schools organized a large labor force to support the countryside. They also actively carried out publicity and education work during their rest time. Urban medical institutions also sent a large number of personnel to tour the countryside to treat diseases.

Communist collaboration has effectively solved the difficulties of labor shortage in some areas, accelerated the harvesting of early rice, and ensured timely transplanting of late rice, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest of late rice. Huangyan and Wenling counties were the first to complete the rush to harvest and plant. Their farming seasons were five to fifteen days earlier than last year. This is inseparable from the communist collaboration carried out by these two counties, with more than 200,000 people participating in the rush to harvest and plant. At the same time, communist collaboration has greatly promoted the close relationship between urban and rural areas, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and created an unprecedented situation of unity among farmers.

The communist collaboration in Zhejiang Province is being carried out in an organized and led manner. The joint instructions issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee not long ago emphasized the importance of communist collaboration. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to this work, and the districts, counties, townships, and communes are organizing and dispatching manpower and materials in a planned way. When the support army set out, many responsible comrades of the county party committee and the township party committee personally led the team and were personally responsible for the leadership of the support contingent.

    冲破地域界限  跳出行业圈子
    浙江二百万人支援农业生产
    本报讯　记者李新民报道：浙江省正当紧张的抢收早稻和抢种晚稻的季节，又遇到了长久不雨的干旱。为了确保早稻丰产丰收，实现“晚稻超早稻、产量翻一番”的跃进计划，全省有二百多万人高举共产主义红旗，投入支援抢收抢种和抗旱斗争。这支支援大军包括工人、机关干部、解放军官兵、文艺工作者、医务人员、学校师生、城镇居民等等。其中特别包括相当数量的农民。他们由于地区不同、作物成熟期不同、作物种类不同、劳力紧张的程度不同，从山区抽出人力和物力去到平原，从棉麻区去到水稻区，从海洋来到陆地，从水利较好的地区去到受旱严重的地区，从节令较晚的地区去到较早的地区帮助抢收抢种和抗旱。
    在农业生产的共产主义大协作中，地域界限已经被冲破了，城市和乡村，工业和农业，专区、县、乡、社之间，出现了人力、物力相互支援、相互调剂的空前团结的局面。
    在钱塘江下游两岸的肖山、海宁、海盐等以棉花、络麻等经济作物为主要生产内容的农业社，派出大批劳动力分赴水稻地区帮助抢收抢种；有的棉麻地区需要抗旱保苗，也从水稻地区获得了抽水机的支援。在浙南山区和金华、建德等专区的山区、半山区，由于水稻面积较少，或季节较迟，或劳动力不及平原区紧张，就组织人力，携带耕牛、种子或农具来支援平原水稻区。义乌县富田乡的农业社社员为了帮助旱情比较严重的全店乡抗旱，把自己水库里的水让给全店乡灌溉，自己则组织一百部水车，翻过十三个山头，到大红里把水接连不断地车到田里来。许多互相竞赛的县、乡、社一面进行竞赛，一面相互支援。嘉兴县就从和自己展开竞赛的嘉善、吴兴两县得到三千多个劳动力的支援，大大地加速了抢收抢种工作。
    城市支援了农村大批人力和物力。杭州市就有五万人的义务劳动大军下乡帮助抢收抢种。嘉兴专区的商业部门平均每天有二千四百八十副货郎担，一万五千多个商业人员送货下乡，上门收购，并参加抢收抢种和抗旱斗争。剧团、电影队、曲艺等文化团体的工作人员纷纷深入田间，边劳动，边宣传，边演唱，边创作，就地取材，就地演出，歌颂先进，歌颂丰收。各级学校师生组织了庞大的劳动队伍下乡支援，他们还利用休息时间积极开展宣传教育工作。城镇医疗机构也抽出大批人员巡回下乡治病。
    共产主义大协作有效地解决了有些地区劳动力不足的困难，加速早稻收割，保证晚稻及时插秧，打下了晚稻大丰收的基础。黄岩、温岭两县最先完成抢收抢种工作，他们的耕作节令比去年提早了五天到十五天，做到晚稻插秧不过大暑关，这是和这两县开展的共产主义大协作、共有二十多万人投入支援抢收抢种工作分不开的。同时共产主义大协作也大大促进了城乡关系的密切，巩固工农联盟，在农民之间也出现了空前团结的局面。
    浙江省的共产主义大协作是有组织有领导地进行的。中共浙江省委、浙江省人民委员会不久前发出的联合指示中，强调共产主义大协作的重要性。各级党委对这一工作极为重视，地、县、乡、社逐级排队，有计划地调度人力和物力。在支援大军出发时，不少县委负责同志和乡党委负责同志还亲自带队，亲自负责支援大队的领导工作。
