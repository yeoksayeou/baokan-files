Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 25th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Jie reports: The 5,000-ton deadweight "Peace No. 28" ocean freighter, built by the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard five months and twelve days ahead of schedule, has returned today after a week of sea trials and performed well. Ten thousand workers held a grand celebration for the ship's completion and a rally to pledge further leaps forward.

The originally scheduled construction time for "Peace No. 28" was eighteen months. During the rectification campaign and the "double-anti" movement, workers repeatedly compressed the construction cycle, finally completing it twelve months and eighteen days ahead of schedule. Excluding holidays and rest days, the actual construction time for this ocean freighter was only one hundred and forty-one days. Such a construction speed is unprecedented in Jiangnan Shipyard's nearly century-long history and unmatched in the history of shipbuilding in China.

In recent years, Jiangnan Shipyard has built the "Democracy No. 10" and "Democracy No. 11" passenger-cargo ocean freighters with a displacement of 2,650 tons, with an average construction cycle of thirteen months. The "Peace No. 28" ocean freighter has a displacement of 8,730 tons, making it the largest tonnage ocean freighter built in our country to date. Its construction time is the shortest, even more than a month shorter than the construction cycle of the similar "Peace No. 25" ocean freighter recently completed by the Dalian Shipyard.

The high-speed construction of "Peace No. 28" by Jiangnan Shipyard workers has become a bright red banner in the current "leap forward again and again" movement in Shanghai factories.

### 五千吨海轮  在江南造船厂建成  吨位最大  建造最快

　　五千吨海轮
    在江南造船厂建成
    吨位最大  建造最快
    据新华社上海25日电　新华社记者高洁报道：上海江南造船厂以五个月零十二天提前建成的载重量五千吨海轮“和平二十八号”，经过一星期海上试航，情况良好。今天试航归来，全厂万名职工举行了隆重的欢庆建船完工和再跃进誓师大会。
    “和平二十八号”原订的建造时间是十八个月，整风和双反运动中工人们一再压缩建造周期，终于提前十二个月零十八天建成，除去例假休息日，这艘海轮的实际建造时间只有一百四十一天。这样的建造速度是江南造船厂建厂近百年来从未有过，也是国内造船史上所没有过的。
    江南厂近几年间曾经造过排水量二千六百五十吨的“民主十号”、“民主十一号”客货海轮，建造周期平均为十三个月。“和平二十八号”海轮的排水量为八千七百三十吨，是我国目前建造的吨位最大的海轮。它的建造时间却最短，比大连造船厂最近建造完工同类型“和平二十五号”海轮周期还短一个多月。
    江南厂工人高速度建造“和平二十八号”的事迹，已经成为上海工厂当前“跃进再跃进”运动中一面鲜明的红旗。
