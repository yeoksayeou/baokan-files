Xinhua Daily News report: Is agricultural tool reform better by pursuing large scale and foreign technology? Or is it better to start small and then go large, first indigenous and then foreign? The agricultural tool reform movement in Zhuangxing Township, Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, answered this question in the previous stage.

After the production targets and measures were greatly increased in Zhuangxing Township, the contradiction between striving for an all-round bumper harvest and insufficient labor became very acute. Cadres and the masses urgently demanded the improvement of agricultural tools to improve labor efficiency. However, the township Party committee did not fully understand the basic policy of reforming agricultural tools, believing that it was necessary to first establish a factory with relatively complete machinery and equipment, and then set up a number of agricultural tool manufacturing factories, in order to realize the plan of innovating agricultural tools. Under the guidance of this idea, the township Party committee, on the one hand, convened a meeting of branch secretaries of the cooperatives, mobilizing each cooperative to raise funds for building factories, and at the same time dispatched cadres in batches to Shanghai and Suzhou to purchase machines and recruit skilled workers. After nearly a month, due to the difficulty in buying lathes, the high wages demanded by skilled workers, and the difficulty in supplying raw materials, not only was the factory not built, but also because the leadership's energy was concentrated on buying machines and building large factories during this period, the leadership of the agricultural tool reform was relaxed, and the agricultural tool reform movement in the township progressed very slowly. Under the influence of the township Party committee, some agricultural cooperatives also had the tendency to pursue large and new things in reforming agricultural tools, while neglecting to transform old and small ones.

In late May, after the county Party committee comrades pointed out that this approach was not in line with the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the township Party committee promptly criticized and corrected the ideological deviation of pursuing large scale and foreign technology, and made a practical inspection of the agricultural tool reform work. During the inspection, typical examples of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results were discovered among the masses. The Hongxing Second Cooperative of the township, under the guidance of the idea of pursuing large scale and foreign technology, installed a new windmill, which took more than a month and cost more than 800 yuan, but still could not produce; while the Guangming Second Cooperative, based on the suggestion of Tang Xiongfei, an old member of the cooperative who was in charge of windmills, used the old stone mill of the cooperative members, and only made a wooden wheel disk of the same thickness as the stone mill at the bottom of the vertical shaft of the windmill, and put on a rubber cloth belt, and a windmill drove two mills, grinding more than 900 kilograms of flour a day, and could still pump water as usual. Because no new materials were needed and the installation was very simple, it only cost six yuan (including carpentry wages) and took two days to install. The township Party committee seized these two typical examples and organized cadres from the whole township to visit them. At the same time, combined with the publicity of the general line, it educated the cadres on the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical construction. Tang Jiquan, deputy director of the Suilun Second Cooperative, said when visiting the Guangming Second Cooperative's wind-powered mill: "The motor-driven mill we built in our cooperative cost more and took more time than this wind-powered mill, but the effect of grinding flour is similar. It is wrong to only think about foreign things." Xu Zhaohua, deputy director of the Xinhua Central Cooperative, also said: "This simple and money-saving method can only be thought of by the masses, and our cadres often only think of machines and steel."

Through the visit, the township and cooperative cadres clarified the direction of first indigenous and then foreign, first small and then large, and fifteen cooperatives in the township promoted the Guangming Second Cooperative's wind-powered mill. They also learned from the experience of other counties, transformed 1,052 new-style plows, refitted 156 bullet waterwheels, and imitated ten kinds of improved agricultural tools such as cotton seedling transplanters, totaling 5,320 pieces, which were put into summer harvesting and planting. At the same time, cadres and the masses were mobilized to be bold in creation. Lu Zengrong, the organization member of the township Party committee, and two carpenters took the lead in creating a successful wooden hydraulic water lifting machine, which had the water lifting capacity equivalent to 20 cattle-powered waterwheels or 100 people's foot-operated flywheel waterwheels. Subsequently, the whole township created ten new tools such as foot-operated flywheel waterwheels, foot-operated powered boats, roller-type square seedling planters, wind-powered rice milling machines, and water-powered flour mills. Most of them were jointly researched and created by cadres, iron and woodworking workers, and agricultural cooperative members. The advantages are that the cost is lower than old agricultural tools, it can greatly save manpower, and it can double the work efficiency.

According to the recent inspection by the Zhuangxing Township Party Committee, the mobilization of the masses in each cooperative is not sufficient, and some agricultural tools are costly, which is not conducive to promotion. The township Party committee plans to focus on the creation and modification of tools needed for the autumn harvest and autumn planting at present, and at the same time solve the above problems, to ensure that all old agricultural tools are replaced with new agricultural tools before the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

### 贪大求洋脱离实际　先小后大多快好省  庄行乡找到改革农具方向

    贪大求洋脱离实际　先小后大多快好省
    庄行乡找到改革农具方向
    新华日报消息　农具改革是求大求洋好？还是由小到大，先土后洋好？江苏省奉贤县庄行乡前一阶段的农具改革运动回答了这个问题。
    庄行乡在生产指标和措施大加码以后，争取全面大丰收和劳力不足的矛盾十分尖锐。干部和群众迫切要求改良农具，提高劳动效率。但是，乡党委对于改革农具的基本方针领会不足，认为必须先建立有比较完备的机器设备的工厂，再办起若干个农具制造工厂，才能实现革新农具的计划。在这样的思想指导下，乡党委一面召开社支部书记会议，动员各社筹集办厂资金，同时分批派出干部，前往上海、苏州购买机器和招聘技术工人。经过将近一个月的时间，由于车床难买，技术工人要求的报酬较高，并且发现原材料供应有困难，不但工厂没有办成，还因为这一期间领导精力集中在买机器办大厂方面，放松了对农具改革的领导，全乡农具改革运动进展很慢。在乡党委的影响之下，一部分农业社改革农具也产生了贪大贪新，忽视改旧改小的偏向。
    5月下旬，经县委负责同志指出这种作法不符合多快好省的方针后，乡党委即时批判纠正了贪大求洋的思想偏向，并对农具改革工作作了一次切实的检查。在检查中发现了群众中存在着多快好省的典型。该乡的红星二社在求大求洋的思想指导下，安装一部新风磨，搞了一个多月，花了八百多块钱，还不能生产；而光明二社根据管风车的老社员唐雄飞的建议，利用社员旧有的石磨，仅在风车的竖轴下部做一个与石磨同等粗细的木条轮盘，套上胶布带子，一部风车就带动了两盘磨子，每天磨面九百多斤，还可照常车水。因为不需新材料，装制又很简便，只花了六块钱（包括木工工资），两天时间就装好了。乡党委抓住这两个典型，组织全乡干部前往参观。同时结合宣传总路线，对干部进行了多快好省建设方针的教育。穗轮二社副社长汤及泉参观了光明二社风力磨时说：“我们社里搞的马达牵引磨比这个风力磨所花成本大，时间也花得多，磨面的效果却差不多，只想搞洋的思想是不对头的。”新华中心社副社长徐兆华也说：“这种简便省钱的方法，只有群众能想得出来，我们干部往往一想就是机器、钢铁。”
    通过参观，乡社干部明确了先土后洋、先小后大的方向，全乡有十五个社推广了光明二社的风力磨。并且学习了外县经验，改造新式犁一千零五十二部，改装弹子水车一百五十六部，以及仿制棉苗移苗器等改良农具十种，共计五千三百二十件，投入夏收夏种。同时，发动干部群众大胆创造。乡党委组织委员陆增荣和两个木匠首先动脑筋创造木制水力戽水机成功，戽水量相当于二十头牛力车水或一百人脚踏飞轮水车。接着，全乡又创造出脚踏飞轮水车、脚踏动力船、滚筒式方格育苗器、风力轧稻机、水力面磨等十种新工具。其中大部分是干部和铁木业工人、农业社员共同研究创造的。优点是造价低于旧农具、能大大节省人力、整倍的提高工作效能。
    根据庄行乡党委最近的检查，各社发动群众还不够充分，有些农具造价较高，不利推广。乡党委计划在当前着重抓住秋收秋种所需工具的创制和改制，同时要解决以上的问题，保证在秋收秋种以前全部改掉旧农具，用上新农具。
