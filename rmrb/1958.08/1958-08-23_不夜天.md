　　Never-Sleeping City
　　After leaving the office in the evening, it was already past twelve o'clock. I was just thinking of grabbing something to eat when I suddenly noticed that the Fuchun Restaurant was still brightly lit. I strode in quickly, and indeed, they had food and drink available. I couldn't help but say, "They're still selling things this late." A customer sitting next to me chimed in, "This place is a 'never-sleeping city'; you can buy food here until dawn." I asked him with a smile, "How do you know?" He replied, "I'm a cart pusher and often transport goods after ten o'clock. When I get hungry, I come in for a bite. This store not only provides convenience for us but also for many passengers getting off late-night trains." At that moment, a young clerk also interjected, "We provide food and drink twenty-four hours a day."
　　Hearing these words, I felt truly heartened by the enthusiasm of the food service workers.

　　不夜天
    晚上走出办公室，已经十二点多了，正想吃点什么，忽然，看到复春饮食店的门面还是亮堂堂的，我三步两脚跨进去，真的，里面有吃有喝，我不禁说了一
    声：“这样晚还有东西卖。”坐在旁边一位客人接口说：“这里是个‘不夜天’，到天亮都能买到吃的。”我笑着问他：“你怎么知道？”他说：“我是推板车的，经常在十时以后运货，饿了就进来吃吃。这店不光方便了我们，还方便了许多深夜下火车的旅客。”这时一个青年店员也接口说：“我们是一天二十四小时供应吃食。”
    听了这些话，真为饮食服务人员的干劲感到舒畅。
