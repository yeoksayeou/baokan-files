　　If You Want To, You Can Do It
    Things in the world are always like this: as long as you are determined to do it, nothing is impossible to achieve. You just need to have one condition: dare to think and dare to do. In the words of the peasants themselves, the bigger the person's courage, the higher the land's yield; "The only thing to fear is not thinking of it; if you think of it, you can do it."
    The young peasant scientific researchers of Shanba Agricultural Cooperative in Dafang County, Guizhou Province, have once again proved this truth with their own practical actions. They are truly people with a communist style of daring to think and daring to act. They did not yield to the long-standing facts and were determined to eliminate the phenomenon of empty corn stalks, determined to "make the corn obediently listen to people, make it grow as many ears as it is told to grow, and not allow it to be naughty." They succeeded, and the corn is already offering more grain to the people according to their commands.
    Corn is like this, and so are other crops. People who dare to think and dare to act, advance more bravely on the road to conquering nature.

### 要办就能办到

　　要办就能办到
    世界上的事情，总是这样的，只要决心去作，没有什么事情不能成功的。只是要具备一个条件：敢想敢干。用农民自己的话说，就是人有多大的胆，地有多高的产；“就怕想不到，想到就能办到”。
    贵州大方县山坝农业社的青年农民科学研究员们用自己的实际行动又证明了这个真理。他们是真正具有共产主义风格的敢想敢干的人，他们不在存在已久的事实面前屈服，决心消灭玉米空秆现象，决心“叫玉米乖乖地听人的话，叫它长几个包就长几个包，不许它调皮捣蛋。”他们胜利了，玉米已经遵照他们的命令向人民供献着更多的粮食。
    玉米是这样，其他的作物也是这样。敢想敢干的人们，在征服自然的道路上更勇敢地前进吧。
