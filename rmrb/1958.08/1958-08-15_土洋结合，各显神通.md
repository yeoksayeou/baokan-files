　　Combining Native and Foreign Methods, Each Displaying Their Talents
　　Wang Ziye
	Giving importance to foreign methods while belittling native ones, trusting foreign experts while distrusting native experts, this was the common perception of bourgeois intellectuals in our country. They often shook their heads and sighed upon hearing the word "native," and their knees went weak upon hearing the word "foreign." This phenomenon has now undergone a great transformation. After the Great Leap Forward in production, countless inventions and creations in science and technology refuted this erroneous prejudice and broke down superstition. In particular, the record wheat harvest this summer stunned many foreign experts, forcing them to admit defeat and acknowledge their inferiority. In industry, electrification, chemical fertilizers, metallurgy, etc., were previously thought to be impossible without relying on foreign methods, but now, with liberated thinking, following the mass line, and relying on native methods, many achievements have been made.
	What is a native method? What is a foreign method? There has always been a popular view that anything native to China is a native method, and anything that is brought from foreign countries and did not exist in China is a foreign method. According to this distinction, many problems cannot be explained. For example, why is it that when our ancestors used drilling wood to make fire, it was a native method, but when foreign ancestors used friction to generate heat, it wasn't a native method? In China's primitive age, water transportation tools were dugout canoes, which were of course a native creation, but foreign countries also started with dugout canoes, so why isn't that a native creation as well? Currently, the people of Yuxian County in Shanxi Province are building a railway using native methods. More than a hundred years ago, when foreign countries built their first railway, their methods were even more primitive than the native methods used in Yuxian. The initial inventions of steam engines, locomotives, ships, airplanes, etc., in foreign countries were all accomplished by native experts using native methods. Speaking of foreign methods, not all of them are necessarily foreign. Bacon believed that the three great inventions of epoch-making significance—the compass, printing, and gunpowder—were created by the Chinese. Our country's great achievements in astronomy, calendar science, mathematics, medicine, etc., have many similarities with foreign methods, coinciding without prior consultation. It can be seen that each country has its own foreign methods and its own native methods.
	Some people say that native methods are unscientific and backward, while foreign methods are scientific and advanced. Regarding whether wheat can achieve high yields, foreign experts said: "No. Wheat is a low-yield crop, and the yield per mu cannot exceed one thousand jin. There is evidence in books." Native experts buried themselves in hard work and achieved records of three thousand, five thousand, and seven thousand jin per mu, and they plan to produce even more next year. Who is scientific and who is unscientific? The native methods of termite control expert Li Shimei surpassed foreign methods. Who is more scientific in this case? Using science to distinguish between native and foreign is itself an unscientific way of distinguishing.
	Native and foreign methods have no regional boundaries, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. It is impossible to say which is absolutely good or bad. In the past, some people wanted to praise one and suppress the other, which was for ulterior motives. How could they not praise foreigners when they relied on them for food and fortune? This is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's slavish mentality.
	Leaving aside these erroneous views, the correct view should acknowledge that native and foreign methods are mutually opposed, yet unified, and have a dialectical relationship.
	The relationship between native and foreign methods is generally one of popularization and improvement. Improvement is based on popularization, and popularization is guided by improvement. The advantage of native methods is that they are relatively simple and easy to implement, yield results quickly, can solve many problems that foreign methods cannot solve by adapting to local conditions, and are closely linked to productive labor, possessing a high degree of vitality. However, native methods also have weaknesses, namely, a lack of systematic scientific theory and failure to master a complete set of scientific testing and inspection rules, so relying on experience has its limitations. Generally speaking, foreign methods not only rely on experience but also have systematic theoretical guidance. However, foreign methods are developed from native methods. Without native methods, there would be no foreign methods. The path of scientific research is always from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level. Inventions in science and technology also prove that native methods always develop towards foreign methods. This is the case from friction to generate heat to steam engines, to electrification, to the atomic energy era.
	In order to accomplish the arduous tasks of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, it is necessary to propose that under the leadership of the Party, both native and foreign methods should be adopted, native and foreign experts should cooperate, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and learn from each other. Native and foreign methods should not fight each other or exclude each other, but should cooperate and unite closely. Their relationship can be summarized as: foreign elements in native methods, native elements in foreign methods, with native methods as the mainstay, and foreign methods should be adapted to local conditions. Only in this way can we maximize effectiveness and better serve socialism and accelerate the realization of the general line of socialist construction. Not long ago, Beijing held a meeting where native and foreign experts in agriculture exchanged experiences in achieving high yields of summer crops. The meeting demonstrated the spirit of mutual learning and cooperation between the two groups of experts, which is an exciting phenomenon.
	How to treat native methods, foreign methods, native experts, and foreign experts is an issue that our Party has always valued. Everyone remembers that as early as 1954, our Party set a brilliant example in dealing with the issue of traditional Chinese medicine. On October 20 of that year, the "People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "Implement the Correct Policy Towards Traditional Chinese Medicine," which stated: "The Party has always called for unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, to help and encourage each other under the general goal of improving modern medicine and medical standards, and better serving the people, to jointly study and research the medical heritage of the motherland, so that it can be continuously promoted and play a greater role." The editorial also criticized the leading departments of health administration at the time for not seriously implementing this policy of the Party and the People's Government, and for accusing them of summarily saying that traditional Chinese medicine was "backward" and "unscientific," and for adopting a sectarian sentiment of completely negating it. The far-reaching consequences of this criticism are becoming increasingly apparent. Today, as our Party has put forward the slogans of technical revolution and cultural revolution, it is still of practical significance to revisit this editorial.

　　土洋结合，各显神通
　　王子野
    重洋法，轻土法，信洋专家，不信土专家，这是我国资产阶级知识分子的普遍观念。他们往往一听到土字就摇头叹气，一听到洋字就膝盖发软。这种现象现在已经有了很大的转变。生产大跃进之后，科学、技术上无数的发明和创造驳倒了这种错误的偏见，破除了迷信。特别是今年夏季的小麦丰产纪录，使得许多洋专家惊得目瞪口呆，不得不甘拜下风，自愧不如。工业上的电气化、化学肥料、冶金等，以前总认为非靠洋法不可，现在解放了思想，走了群众路线，依靠土法也办出了不少的成绩。
    什么叫土法？什么叫洋法？自来有一种流行的看法，认为凡是中国土生土长的就是土法；凡是中国所无而从外国搬来的就是洋法。依此区分，有许多问题就不能得到说明。例如：为什么我们的祖先由钻木而取火是土法，而外国人的祖先用摩擦取热又为什么不是土法？水上的交通工具在中国原始时代是独木船，当然是土创造，外国也是从独木船开始的，为什么又不是土创造呢？目前我国山西盂县人民修了一条铁路，用的是土法，一百多年前外国修筑第一条铁路，其法比盂县的土法还要土。外国当初发明蒸汽机、机车、轮船、飞机等等，也都是一些土专家靠土法搞起来的。说到洋法，也未必都是外来的，培根认为有划时代意义的三大发明——指南针、印刷术、火药，就是中国人搞的。我国在天文历法、数学、医药等等方面的伟大成就，有许多和外国的洋法并无不同，不谋而合。可见各国都有各国的洋法，也都有自己的土法。
    有的人说，土法不科学，是落后的，洋法是合乎科学的，是先进的。小麦能不能丰产，洋专家说：“不行。小麦是低产作物，亩产不能超过一千斤。有书为证。”土专家埋头苦干，搞出了亩产三千、五千、七千多斤的纪录，明年还要多。究竟谁科学，谁不科学呢？防治白蚁土专家李始美的土法胜过了洋法，这又是谁比谁科学呢？用科学不科学来区分土和洋，这个分法本身就是不科学的。
    土法和洋法既无地区的界限，又是互有长短，说不上绝对的好坏。过去有人要捧一个，打一个，是别有用心的。靠着洋人吃饭、发财，不捧洋人怎么行呢？这是资产阶级的奴性表现。
    撇开这些错误的看法不谈。正确的看法应当承认土法和洋法是相互对立着的，却又是统一着的，是辩证法的关系。
    土法和洋法的关系大体上是普及和提高的关系。在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。土法的好处是比较简单易行，容易见效，可以因地制宜地解决许多洋法不能解决的问题，并且和生产劳动血肉相联，有高度的生命力。但是，土法也有弱点的一面，就是缺乏系统的科学理论，没有掌握住科学化验和检查等成套规律，凭经验总是有局限性的。洋法一般讲来不仅凭经验，而且有系统的学理的指导。但是，洋法是从土法发展起来的，没有土法就不会有洋法，科学研究的途径总是由简易到复杂，由低级到高级的。科学、技术上发明也都证明土法总是向洋法发展的。从摩擦生热到蒸汽机，到电气化，到原子能时代就是如此。
    为了完成技术革命、文化革命的艰巨任务，应当提出在党的领导之下土法洋法并举，土专家洋专家合作，取长补短，相互学习。土法和洋法不应当相互打架，彼此排斥，而应该相互合作，亲密团结。它们的关系可以归结为：土中有洋，洋中有土，以土为主，洋要带土。只有这样，才能发挥高度的效能，才能更好地为社会主义服务和加速社会主义建设总路线的实现。不久以前北京开了一个会，农业方面的土专家和洋专家进行了今年夏收作物丰产经验的交流，会上就体现出两部分专家互相学习、互相合作的精神，这是令人兴奋的现象。
    如何对待土法、洋法，土专家、洋专家，这是我们党从来都很重视的问题。大家都记得，还在1954年，我们党在处理对待中医问题上曾作出了光辉的示范。这一年的10月20日“人民日报”曾发表过一篇社论“贯彻对待中医的正确政策”，上面说：“党一贯号召中、西医团结合作，在提高现代医学和医疗水平、更好地为人民服务的总目标下互助互勉，共同学习和研究祖国的医学遗产，使它不断地发扬光大，发挥更大的作用。”社论还批判了当时卫生行政领导部门没有认真执行党和人民政府的这一政策，指责他们笼统地说中医“落后”、“不科学”，全盘加以否定的宗派主义情绪。这个批判的深远后果是愈来愈明显了。当我们党提出了技术革命、文化革命口号的今天，重温一次这篇社论还是有现实意义的。
