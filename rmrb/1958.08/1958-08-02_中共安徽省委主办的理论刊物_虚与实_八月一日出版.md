Theoretical Journal Sponsored by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, "Emptiness and Reality," Published on August 1st

    (From Our Own Correspondent) The inaugural issue of the monthly political theory journal "Emptiness and Reality," sponsored by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was published on August 1st.

    The inaugural issue includes an article by Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, titled "Eliminate Superstition and Liberate Thought." This article systematically discusses that to promote the leap forward development of the revolutionary cause, it is necessary to eliminate superstition and liberate thought; and the key to eliminating superstition and liberating thought lies in mastering Comrade Mao Zedong's ideological weapon.

    The inaugural issue also published articles such as "Raise the Red Flag of the General Line Higher and Advance" by Zhang Kaifan, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee, and "Who Says Marxism-Leninism Cannot Increase Grain Production?" by Gui Linqi, Secretary of the Provincial Committee.

    Subscriptions and single purchases of this journal from various regions are very enthusiastic, and the inaugural issue is expected to be distributed in 200,000 copies.
