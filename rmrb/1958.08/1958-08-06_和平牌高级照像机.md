    Peace Brand Advanced Camera
    The Northwest Optical Instrument Factory has successfully trial-produced a small, high-quality camera – the "Peace" brand camera.
    The "Peace" brand camera shutter uses a cloth curtain type, with speeds ranging from B, one second, one-half second, one-tenth of a second... to one-five-hundredth of a second, with the fastest reaching one-thousandth of a second. Therefore, it can photograph airplanes in flight and various faster-paced sporting activities. This camera has an automatic rangefinder device and is combined with the viewfinder in one eyepiece, making framing and focusing very convenient.
    The raw materials for the "Peace" brand camera lens are entirely domestically produced. This camera is expected to go into production in the second half of this year. (Yang Tingliang)

    和平牌高级照像机
    西北光学仪器厂试制成功一部小型高级照像机——“和平”牌照像机。
    “和平”牌照像机快门采用布帘式，速度从B门，一秒，二分之一秒，十分之一秒……五百分之一秒，最快达到千分之一秒，因而它能拍摄正在飞行中的飞机和速度较快的各项体育活动。这种照像机有自动对距装置，并和取景器合并在一个目镜里，因此取景对距非常方便。
    “和平”牌照像机镜头的原料完全是国产的。这种照像机今年下半年即可投入生产。　（杨廷良）
