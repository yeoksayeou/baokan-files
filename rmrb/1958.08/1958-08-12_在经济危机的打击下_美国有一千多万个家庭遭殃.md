Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th: A survey report released today by Professor Haber and Professor Cohen of the University of Michigan stated that since the middle of last year, 12.5 million American families have been affected by the economic crisis, which is more serious than any period after the war.

    This report was compiled by a survey team from the University of Michigan after conducting surveys across the country. The report said that among these 12.5 million families, 8.5 million families had one member who experienced unemployment at some point between mid-1957 and mid-1958; in addition, the heads of 4 million families had their working hours reduced by employers, and 700,000 families had more than one member unemployed.

    The report stated that in the past year, unemployment has mostly concentrated in families with an annual income of less than $5,000 (which is the income necessary for a family of four to maintain a basic standard of living). As for families with slightly higher incomes, they were more affected by the reduction of working hours.

    The report said that the lives of the unemployed families are very difficult: 26% of the families are unable to repay their debts for purchases, 22% of the families live on borrowed money, 21% of the families rely on relatives and friends to maintain their lives, 11% of the families moved to places with cheaper rent, and 4% of the families rely on social relief for survival.

　　在经济危机的打击下
　　美国有一千多万个家庭遭殃
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：美国密执安大学哈比尔教授和柯亨教授今天发表一个调查报告说，从去年年中到现在，美国有一千二百五十万个家庭受到经济危机的打击，这比战后任何时期都要严重。
    这个报告是由密执安大学一个调查组在全国各地进行调查后编制的。报告说，在这一千二百五十万个家庭中，有八百五十万个家庭有一个成员在1957年年中到1958年年中某一时期遭到失业；另外四百万个家庭的家长的工作时间遭雇主削减，七十万个家庭有两个以上的成员失业。
    报告说，在过去一年中，失业大部分集中在每年收入不到五千美元（这是四口之家要维持普通生活所必需的收入）的家庭里，至于收入稍多的家庭，它们较多地受到工作时间减少的影响。
    报告说，失业者的家庭的生活十分困苦：26％的家庭无法偿还买东西的欠款，22％的家庭靠借债度日，21％的家庭靠亲友维持生活，11％的家庭搬到房租较便宜的地方去住，4％的家庭靠社会救济为生。
