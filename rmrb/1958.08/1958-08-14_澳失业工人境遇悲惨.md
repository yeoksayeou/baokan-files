Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Many unemployed workers in Sydney are falling into an abyss of suffering. It is estimated that more than two hundred unemployed people sleep in Sydney's parks every night.
    Recently, an unemployed man, seeking shelter from the rain, slept in a subway tunnel and was run over and torn to pieces by a train during the night.
    Another person climbed into a pile of garbage in a garbage incinerator to sleep. While this person was asleep, municipal workers, unaware that anyone was inside, lit the fire, burning the person alive.

　　澳失业工人境遇悲惨
    据新华社讯　在悉尼有许多失业工人正在陷入痛苦的深渊中。据估计，每天晚上到悉尼的公园里睡觉的失业者超过了二百人。
    最近，有一个失业者为了避雨而躲在地下铁路的隧道里睡觉，结果在夜里被火车辗成数段。
    还有一个人爬到一个垃圾焚化炉的垃圾堆里去睡觉。在这个人睡熟的时候，市政工人不知道炉内有人，把火点起来，结果就把这个人活活烧死。
