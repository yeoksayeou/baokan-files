    Sufficient Potassium Fertilizer Can Prevent Lodging
    I was an agricultural worker three years ago and have studied the problem of rice lodging. I believe the cause of lodging is not close planting, but the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer. Most farmers in our country do not pay attention to applying potassium fertilizer to rice. Some farmers think that lodging is caused by too much fertilizer, but in fact, it is not that there is too much fertilizer, but that there is too little potassium fertilizer.
    In order to make the rice stalks grow thick and strong, more grass ash, lime, and ash from burnt snails and mussel shells should be applied. These fertilizers contain a lot of potassium and have the effect of strengthening the stalks.

    施足钾肥能防倒伏
    我在三年以前是一个农业工作者，对水稻倒伏问题曾研究过。倒伏的原因，我认为不是密植，而是肥料中的氮磷钾的比重问题。我国农民多不注意给水稻下钾肥，有一些农民认为倒伏是肥多了，其实肥并不多而是钾肥太少。
    为了使水稻秆子长得粗状硬扎，要多施一些草木灰、石灰和螺蛳壳、蚌壳烧的灰，这些肥科含钾多，有壮秆子的作用。
