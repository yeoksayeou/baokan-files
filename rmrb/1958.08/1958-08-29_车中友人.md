　　Friend in the Car

    The train sped along with a deafening roar. Tired of reading the magazine, I put the book down and focused on the distant scenery. I didn't notice when the train passed Jinhua, or when a new group of passengers got on. It wasn't until I paid attention to the changes in the car that I realized I had a new friend beside me.
    He was a young farmer, around twenty years old, with a net bag containing a few changes of clothes and an umbrella. We smiled at each other and nodded, marking the beginning of our journey together.
    He quickly noticed the magazine I had placed on the seat and reached out, saying, "May I borrow it to take a look?" I immediately handed him the July issue of "People's Literature."
    He read it silently with great interest.
    The train passed several small stations, and he kept his eyes glued to "People's Literature." I nudged his arm and asked, "Comrade, where are you going?"
      "Qu County."
      "Going home or to a meeting?"
      "Coming from home, going to agricultural university."
    Oh! An agricultural university student! I started chatting with him with great interest.
    This young man's name is Zhang Chaomin, the production team leader of the Qinjian Cooperative in Jianshe Township, Lanxi County. He is currently studying at the Qu County Senior Agricultural School. This time, he got a three-day leave to go back to Lanxi to check on the cooperative's production.
    "I am studying agricultural machinery. The school is holding a big debate, and we are vigorously engaging in technological revolution. Our slogan is: 'To Hangzhou next year, and to Beijing the year after!'"
    Zhang Chaomin talked to me for a long time, as freely as an old friend. He mentioned the situation when Zhou Jianren, the governor of Zhejiang Province, visited them. He said, "Governor Zhou, Mr. Lu Xun's younger brother, he looked at everything, the experimental fields, the cafeteria, the dormitories. His situation report was like listening to an opera, every sentence was pleasant to hear. He also asked me if I was eating well. I stretched out my arm, and he pinched it, saying repeatedly, 'Good! Strong, strong!'" The young man smiled proudly when he said this.
    I also asked about the agricultural university's courses, and he readily said, "We work four hours every day, carrying out high-yield experiments with rice and sweet potatoes, and also studying the parts of water pumps and tractors. We are keeping up with mathematics, physics, and chemistry."
    "We were all selected and then selected again by the advanced cooperatives and sent here with recommendations. When we pick up a hoe, we can dig and dig, and when we pick up a pen, we can write fluently." When he said this, his expression was so joyful! (Attached picture)

　　车中友人
　　戈中
    列车轰隆地飞驰。看杂志疲倦了，我把书搁下，专注地看着远方。火车什么时候过了金华，什么时候又换了一批旅客我都没有觉察。等我注意车厢里的变动时，我才发觉我的身旁也换了朋友。
    这是一位青年农民，二十岁上下，随身带了一个网袋，里面装着几件换洗衣服，此外还有一把雨伞。我和他相视而笑，点点头，算是开始结成旅伴。
    他很快就发现我搁在座位上的杂志，伸过手来说：“请借给我看看。”我立刻将7月号“人民文学”递了过去。
    他津津有味地默读着。
    火车又经过几个小站，他都一眼不眨地在看“人民文学”。我碰碰他的胳膊说：“同志，上哪儿去？”
      “衢县。”
      “回家，还是开会？”
      “从家里来，上农业大学。”
    哦！农业大学的学生，我怀着极大的兴趣和他攀谈起来。
    这个小伙子叫张朝民，兰溪县建设乡勤俭社的生产队长，现在在衢县高级农业学校学习。这次是请假三天，回兰溪看看社里的生产情况。
    “我是学农业机械的，学校里正在进行大辩论，大搞技术革命，我们的口号是：‘明年到杭州，后年上北京！’”
    张朝民和我谈了许久，像老朋友一样毫无拘束。他谈到浙江省周建人省长去看望他们的情形。他说：“周省长，鲁迅先生的弟弟，他什么地方都看，试验田、食堂、宿舍。他作的形势报告，像唱戏文一样，句句动听。他还问我吃得好不好？我伸出胳膊，他捏了一把，连声说：‘好！结实，结实！’”说到这里这个小伙子得意地笑了。
    我又问起农业大学的课程，他爽快地说：“我们每天劳动四小时，搞水稻、甘薯的高额丰产试验，同时还在研究戽水机、拖拉机的零件。数学、理化，都跟得上。”
    “我们都是高级社挑选了又挑选，保送来的，拿起锄头能刨能挖，提起笔杆能哗哗淌墨水。”说这句话时，他的神情显得那么愉快！（附图片）
