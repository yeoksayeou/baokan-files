Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on Supporting the Soviet Proposal to Convene an Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, August 8, 1958

	On August 5, 1958, the Soviet government proposed convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to consider the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan. This is another major peaceful effort made by the Soviet government after its proposal to convene a summit of major powers to discuss easing tensions in the Near and Middle East was repeatedly obstructed and stubbornly rejected by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. The Chinese government fully supports this proposal of the Soviet government. At present, the United States and the United Kingdom continue to increase their troops in Lebanon and Jordan, expanding their occupied areas. The situation in the Near and Middle East remains tense, and international peace and security continue to suffer serious threats. The Chinese government believes that all peace-loving countries have a responsibility to take all possible measures to urge the United States and the United Kingdom to immediately withdraw their aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan and restore peace in the Near and Middle East region.

	The United States and the United Kingdom are attempting to cover up their naked acts of aggression against Lebanon and Jordan with the trumped-up so-called indirect aggression by the United Arab Republic against Lebanon and Jordan. This is a case of the thief crying "stop thief," and it cannot deceive anyone. Even the United Nations observer group sent to Lebanon to conduct investigations has repeatedly admitted that it cannot confirm any so-called indirect aggression. The United Kingdom's aggression against Jordan with the support of the United States does not even have a so-called excuse of indirect aggression; it was only when the United Kingdom sent troops to invade Jordan that the King of Jordan completed the formalities of accusing so-called indirect aggression. The United States and the United Kingdom hastily sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan on the assumption that the Iraqi revolution was so-called indirect aggression. Now, the recognition of the Republic of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom is in fact a declaration of the bankruptcy of this absurd excuse. If the United States and the United Kingdom, in the face of undeniable facts and strong public opinion, cannot but recognize that the Iraqi people have the right to choose their own government and that there is no such thing as indirect aggression, then what reason do they have to carry out armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan?

	Opposing imperialism and its agents and striving for and safeguarding the independence and freedom of all Arab countries is the unanimous demand of the entire Arab people. The US and British imperialists describe the Arab countries' struggle for independence and freedom as indirect aggression by the United Arab Republic against other Arab countries. This is not only a slander against the United Arab Republic, but also an insult to all Arab people. The Chinese people express great indignation at this slander by imperialism and resolutely support the just struggle of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and all Arab countries against colonialist aggression.

	The US and British aggressive troops occupying Lebanon and Jordan are a serious threat to peace and security in the Near and Middle East and the world. All peace-loving countries and people in the world demand that US and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. If the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly can be convened in accordance with the Soviet proposal, it may provide an opportunity to promote the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan and to ease tensions in the Near and Middle East. The Chinese government believes that only if the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly truly assumes the solemn responsibility of stopping aggression and safeguarding peace in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with the urgent wishes of the people of the world, can it redeem the credibility that the United Nations has lost in the eyes of the world's people. Whether the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly can be convened in accordance with the Soviet proposal, and whether it can realize the urgent wishes of the people of the world after the meeting, is another historical test.

	The Chinese government and the Chinese people, together with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, resolutely demand that the United States and the United Kingdom immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan and restore peace in the Near and Middle East region. Regardless of the outcome of the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, as long as the aggressive troops of the United States and the United Kingdom have not completely withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan, US and British imperialism will not escape the serious responsibility for threatening peace and security in the Near and Middle East and the world, and will not escape the just condemnation and firm opposition of the Arab people and the people of all countries in the world.

    我国政府发表声明支持苏联建议
    坚决要求美英撤军恢复中近东地区和平
    联大面临能否真正制止侵略保卫和平的又一次历史考验
    新华社8日讯  中华人民共和国政府关于支持苏联建议召开联合国大会紧急特别会议的声明  1958年8月8日
    1958年8月5日苏联政府建议召开联合国大会紧急特别会议来考虑美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队立即撤出约旦的问题。这是苏联政府关于召开大国政府首脑会议讨论和缓中近东紧张局势的建议遭到了美、英两国政府的一再阻挠和顽固拒绝之后所作的又一次重大的和平努力。中国政府完全支持苏联政府这个建议。现在，美、英还继续在黎巴嫩和约旦增加军队、扩大占领区域，中近东的局势仍然处于紧张状态，国际和平和安全仍然遭受着严重威胁。中国政府认为，所有爱好和平的国家有责任采取一切可能的措施促使美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军队，恢复中近东地区的和平。
    美国和英国企图用阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩和约旦进行莫须有的所谓间接侵略来掩盖它们对黎巴嫩和约旦的赤裸裸的侵略行为。这是贼喊捉贼，骗不了任何人的。就是派到黎巴嫩去进行调查的联合国观察团也一再承认不能证实有所谓间接侵略。英国在美国支持下侵略约旦，连一个所谓间接侵略的借口也没有，而只是在英国派兵侵入约旦的时候，约旦国王才补办了一个控诉所谓间接侵略的手续。美国和英国是在断定伊拉克革命就是所谓间接侵略的情况下慌忙派兵侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的。现在，美国和英国对伊拉克共和国的承认事实上正是宣告了这个荒谬借口的破产。如果美国和英国在不容置辩的事实面前和强大的舆论压力之下不能不承认伊拉克人民有权选择自己的政府，根本不存在什么间接侵略的问题，那末，它们还有什么理由对黎巴嫩和约旦的内政进行武装干涉呢？
    反对帝国主义及其代理人、争取和维护阿拉伯各国的独立和自由，是全体阿拉伯人民的一致要求。美、英帝国主义把阿拉伯各国人民争取独立自由的斗争说成是阿拉伯联合共和国对其它阿拉伯国家的间接侵略，这不仅是对阿拉伯联合共和国的诬蔑，而且也是对全体阿拉伯人民的侮辱。中国人民对于帝国主义的这种污蔑表示极大的愤慨，并且坚决支持阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克共和国和所有阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义侵略的正义斗争。
    侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的美、英侵略军队是对中近东和世界和平和安全的严重威胁。全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民都要求美、英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。联合国大会紧急特别会议如果能够按照苏联的提案召开，它才有可能提供一个促使美、英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦、缓和中近东紧张局势的机会。中国政府认为，联合国大会紧急特别会议只有根据联合国宪章的精神，依照全世界人民的迫切愿望，真正负起制止侵略、保卫和平的庄严责任，它才能挽回联合国在世界人民面前已经丧失的信用。联合国大会的紧急特别会议能否按照苏联的提案召开，开会后能否实现全世界人民的迫切愿望，这是又一次的历史考验。
    中国政府和中国人民同全世界爱好和平的国家和人民一道坚决要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的军队，恢复中近东地区的和平。不管联合国大会紧急特别会议召开的结果如何，只要有一天美国和英国的侵略军队还没有完全撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，美、英帝国主义就一天不能逃脱威胁中近东和世界和平和安全的严重责任，就一天不能逃脱阿拉伯人民和世界各国人民的正义谴责和坚决反对。
