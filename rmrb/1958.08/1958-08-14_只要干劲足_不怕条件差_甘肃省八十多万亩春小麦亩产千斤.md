Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 13th: Gansu Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of spring wheat this year. Out of the 9,310,000 mu of spring wheat harvested, over 810,000 mu achieved an average per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin. Among these, over 1,500 mu yielded between 2,000 and 3,000 jin per mu, over 350 mu yielded between 3,000 and 4,000 jin per mu, and over 20 mu yielded over 4,000 jin per mu.

The large-scale bumper harvest of spring wheat in Gansu Province occurred in both the irrigated plains, such as Zhangye and Wuwei, and the arid regions, such as Dingxi and Dongxiang. It not only appeared in the desert areas of Dunhuang and Anxi, but also on land surrounded by the Gobi Desert, such as Huoshaogou in Yumen. Huoshaogou has always been known as a low-yielding area in the Gobi Desert, but this year, due to the Great Leap Forward in production, 1,087 mu of spring wheat achieved a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin.

The reason Gansu Province was able to achieve a bumper harvest of spring wheat is the result of continuous revolution in targets and measures. This year, the province's production situation is characterized by: for every foot the target rises, the measures rise ten feet. The target drives the measures, and the measures promote the continuous modification of the target, so that production is constantly in a state of upsurge.

In January and February this year, the Provincial Party Congress and meetings of cadres and the masses thoroughly criticized the fallacy of those who held the "Gansu is backward" theory, who believed that Gansu's natural conditions were poor and that production could only increase slowly. This resolved the contradiction between advanced and backward targets and further increased the grain production targets.

During the spring wheat sowing season this year, there was a severe drought, making it impossible to sow. On the basis of large-scale water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring, the masses and cadres, in order to complete the sowing plan, put forward the slogan of "Every fen sown is a fen gained; every seedling protected is a seedling saved." They mobilized the masses to carry water, carry ice, and dig ditches to divert water for sowing. As a result, the sowing work was done very well, and the sowing period was shortened by half a month compared to last year. All the sowing was done by row planting and close planting, and a variety of improved seeds were used.

In April, after the spring wheat was sown, it was found that in many places the measures were not keeping up with the planned targets. In some places, the planned targets remained at the level of the commune and team, and measures were not implemented on the ground with responsibilities assigned to individuals. In some areas, the measures were not advanced, and in a few places, there were no measures at all. At this time, in order to resolve the contradiction between advanced targets and backward measures, various localities launched a "four comparisons" movement: "compare hard work, compare measures, compare progress, compare actual results." The Provincial Party Committee also specifically inspected and evaluated thirty-eight counties and cities with planned per-mu yields of 400 jin. The cultivated land area of these thirty-eight counties and cities accounted for 41.4% of the province's total, and the inspection greatly promoted the increase in wheat production throughout the province. Various localities further increased topdressing fertilizer, increased irrigation, weeded, and strengthened the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. Most areas achieved three irrigations and four fertilizations, or four irrigations and five fertilizations. In many areas, almost all of the Class III fields disappeared, and in individual counties, almost 100% of the fields became Class I fields, which is why large-scale high-yield achievements were obtained.

### 只要干劲足　不怕条件差　甘肃省八十多万亩春小麦亩产千斤

　　只要干劲足　不怕条件差
　　甘肃省八十多万亩春小麦亩产千斤
    据新华社兰州13日电　甘肃省今年春小麦获得空前大丰收。在收获的九百三十一万亩春小麦中，有八十一万多亩平均亩产一千斤以上。其中亩产二千到三千斤的有一千五百多亩，三千斤到四千斤的有三百五十多亩，四千斤以上的有二十多亩。
    甘肃省出现的春小麦大面积丰收，有的是在平原灌溉区，如张掖和武威；有的是在干旱地区，如定西和东乡。它不但出现在沙漠地区的敦煌和安西，也出现在像玉门火烧沟那样被四周戈壁包围的土地上。火烧沟是历来出名的戈壁滩上低产地，今年因为生产大跃进，有一千零八十七亩春小麦亩产一千斤以上。
    甘肃省春小麦所以能够丰收，是在指标和措施上不断革命的结果。今年这个省的生产情况是：指标高一尺，措施高一丈，用指标带动措施，又用措施促使指标的不断修改，使生产经常处在高涨状态中。
    今年1、2月省党代表大会及各级干部、群众会议彻底地批判了“甘肃落后论”者认为甘肃自然条件差，生产只能慢慢来的谬论，解决了先进指标和落后指标之间的矛盾，把粮食生产指标进一步提高。
    今年春小麦播种时期严重干旱，下不了种，群众和干部在去冬今春大修水利的基础上，为了完成播种计划，提出“抢种一分是一分，保治一苗是一苗”的口号，千军万马，一齐动手大力用担水、背冰、开沟引水等办法进行播种，结果播种工作做得很好，播种期比去年缩短了半个月，全部做到条播密植，实现了多样良种化。
    4月，春小麦播种以后，发现许多地方措施赶不上计划指标，有些地方计划指标停留在社队，没有做到措施到地，责任到人，有些地区措施不先进，个别地方没有措施。这时，各地为了解决先进指标和落后措施之间的矛盾，发起“比苦干，比措施，比进度，比实效”四比运动，省委并专门检查评比了三十八个计划亩产四百斤的县和市，这三十八个县和市的耕地面积占全省的41.4％，检查后对全省小麦增产起了很大的促进作用。各地进一步增加追肥、增加灌水、锄草和加强防治病虫害。大部分地区做到三水四肥、四水五肥，许多地区的三类田几乎绝迹，个别县几乎百分之百变成了一类田，因此才获得了大面积高产成绩。
