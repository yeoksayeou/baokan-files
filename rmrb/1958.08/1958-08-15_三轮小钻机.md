Creating More and Better New Products

　　Three-Wheeled Small Drilling Rig
　　China's first hand-cranked/power-driven, combined engineering geology and hydrogeology three-wheeled 245 drilling rig was recently successfully trial-produced in the repair shop of the First Ministry of Machine Building's Surveying and Mapping Company.
　　This drilling rig only requires two workers to operate, which is six fewer workers than the existing 127 hand-cranked drilling rig. At the same time, because the drilling rig's frame is composed of three bicycle wheels, transfer and transportation are extremely convenient. Preliminary estimates indicate that its work efficiency can be increased by more than fifteen times compared to existing drilling rigs.
　　The 245 drilling rig has a maximum opening diameter of 9 and 3/4 inches and a depth of up to 50 meters. If there is no power, it can be operated manually. Because the weight of the drilling rig is reduced by one-third compared to before, the labor intensity is also greatly reduced.

　　三轮小钻机
    我国第一台手摇动力两用、工程地质与水文地质相结合的三轮车型245钻机，最近在第一机械工业部勘测公司修理车间试制成功。
    这种钻机只用两个工人操作，比现有的127手摇钻机可以减少六个工人，同时由于钻机脚架是由三个自行车轮组成，转移运送极为方便。初步估计，它的工作效率可比现有的钻机提高十五倍以上。
    245钻机开口最大直径可达九又四分之三英吋，深度可达五十公尺。如果没有动力，可以用手工操作，由于钻机重量比以前减少三分之一，劳动强度也大大降低。
