　　The Red and Expert Road for Government Cadres
　　Shu Wen
    The revolutionary situation is pressing, and everyone has to do the work of several or even dozens of people. Although our cadres cannot master all eighteen martial arts, they must at least be proficient in one and have a rough understanding of many others. In other words, they must transform themselves from one-sided individuals into multi-faceted talents. How to cultivate this? There are two different methods here. One is to remove cadres from their work and have them study full-time. This method is of course good, but it requires a relatively long time, which is completely incompatible with the revolutionary situation where one day equals twenty years. The other method is to mobilize the masses to teach and learn from each other, and improve together. In this way, many cadres can be transformed from one-sided individuals into multi-faceted talents in just a few months or even weeks, instead of several years. The Red and Expert University run by the Fourth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building is a vivid example.
    There are various types of work in government offices, as well as many experts who are familiar with their own work. According to the principle of "the able are teachers," not only should the majority of cadres in government offices become students learning to be multi-faceted talents, but many cadres can also serve as teachers to cultivate multi-faceted talents. Some cadres are students in one area of expertise, while they are teachers in another. Running a Red and Expert University is precisely about giving full play to this characteristic of government offices and fully utilizing the method of the mass line.
    Another characteristic of this Red and Expert University is that it starts from the work of the government office and serves the work of the government office. Do what you do, learn what you learn; learn what you learn, use what you use. This is true for both professional courses and political courses. Learning promotes the improvement of work, and work consolidates the achievements of learning. It is truly learning for application and combining learning with application. The contradiction between learning and work is harmoniously unified here.
    Some people look down on this kind of Red and Expert University, saying that it is "seeking quick success and instant benefit," and that it cannot solve the problem of being both red and expert. Our view is exactly the opposite. It is "seeking quick success and instant benefit," but what it is anxious about is the "success" of rapidly cultivating multi-faceted talents, and what it is seeking is the "benefit" of rapidly promoting a great leap forward in the work of government offices. What is wrong with this "success" and this "benefit"? Of course, there is no limit to learning, and we should not be satisfied with what we have already learned. We must continue to improve and constantly deepen our knowledge. The comrades of the Fourth Design Institute put it well. They said: we are not "aiming too high," but "aiming high and working nearby." "High" is certainly good, and we cannot but "like" it, but we are setting our sights high and starting from the ground, setting our sights far and starting from the near, setting our sights on improvement and starting from popularization. Without these, empty talk about being both red and expert is the business of dreamers.
    The Red and Expert University is a broad road for government cadres to achieve both redness and expertise, and this must be affirmed.

　　机关干部的红专大道
　　舒文
    革命形势着着逼人，每一个人都要当几个以至几十个人用。我们的干部虽然不能十八般武艺件件精通，至少也要一件精通多件粗通，也就是说必须把自己从一面手培养成多面手。如何培养？这里有两种不同的方法，一种是使干部脱离工作岗位，专门进行学习。这一种方法当然好，但是需要较长的时间，这和一天等于二十年的革命形势，完全不相适应。另一种方法就是发动群众互教互学，共同提高，这样，不用几年，只用几个月，甚至几个星期，就可以使很多干部从一面手变成多面手。第一机械部第四设计院所办的红专大学，就是活生生的例证。
    机关中有多种业务，也有很多熟悉自己业务的能手。按照能者为师的原则，机关中不仅多数干部应成为学习多面手的学生，而且不少干部还可以作培养多面手的先生。有些干部在这门业务上是学生，在另外一门业务上就是先生。办红专大学正是充分发挥机关的这一特点，充分运用群众路线的方法。
    这种红专大学的又一特点是从机关的工作出发、为机关工作服务。作什么，学什么；学什么，用什么。业务课如此，政治课也如此。学习促进了工作的改进，工作巩固了学习的成果。真正是学以致用，学用结合。学习和工作的矛盾，在这里有了最和谐的统一。
    对这种红专大学，有人是看不上眼的，他们说这是“急功近利”，说这样解决不了红透专深的问题。我们的看法正好相反。这是“急功近利”，但这急的是迅速培养多面手的“功”，近的是迅速促使机关工作大跃进的“利”，此“功”此“利”，有什么不好？当然，学无止境，我们不应该满足已经学到的东西，要继续提高，不断深造。第四设计院的同志提得好，他们说：我们不是“好高骛远”，而是“好高骛近”。“高”当然好，不能不“好”，但我们是从高处着眼，低处着手，从远处着眼，近处着手，从提高着眼，普及着手。离开了这些，空谈红透专深，那是幻想家的事。
    红专大学是机关干部通向红透专深的一条广阔的路，这一点必须肯定。
