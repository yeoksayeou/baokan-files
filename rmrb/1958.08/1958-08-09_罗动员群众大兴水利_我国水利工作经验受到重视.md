Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 6th: Romania is formulating a long-term plan for water conservancy construction and will launch mass water conservancy projects.  Bao Spiridon, director of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, recently told our reporter that by 1960, Romania will have built protective dikes and drainage projects for 400,000 hectares of land. At that time, the irrigated area will be further increased.

The Romanian government recently established a National Irrigation and Drainage Committee. Bao Spiridon said that up to now, Romania's water conservancy projects have relied entirely on state investment for construction, so the projects are limited.  Starting this year, Romania will mobilize the masses to build local, small- and medium-sized water conservancy projects.  Soldiers of the Romanian People's Army will also be involved in water conservancy construction.

Most of Romania's rivers have floodplains; the Danube floodplain alone covers 950,000 hectares.  At the same time, rainfall is insufficient, and the country's land needs irrigation. Therefore, water conservancy construction is very important.  At present, the country has 110,000 hectares of irrigated land, which has appeared only after liberation.

Bao Spiridon, who recently led a Romanian water conservancy delegation to China for a 45-day visit, told reporters, "The leap forward in China's water conservancy truly moved us, and our water conservancy work will be influenced by China." He also mentioned the importance that Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chivu Stoica attaches to China's experience in water conservancy construction.

    罗动员群众大兴水利
    我国水利工作经验受到重视
    新华社布加勒斯特6日电  罗马尼亚正在制定一个兴修水利的远景规划，并将开展群众性的兴修水利的工作。罗马尼亚农林部水利局局长鲍·斯比里顿最近对本社记者说，到1960年，罗马尼亚将修建四十万公顷土地的保护堤和排水工程。那时灌溉面积将进一步增加。
    罗马尼亚政府最近成立了全国灌溉和排水委员会。鲍·斯比里顿说，到目前为止，罗马尼亚的水利工程完全依靠国家投资兴修，因此，工程是有限的。从今年开始，罗马尼亚将动员群众兴修地方性的中、小型水利工程。罗马尼亚人民军的战士也将投入兴修水利的工作。
    罗马尼亚的河流大都有泛滥区，仅多瑙河的泛滥区就达九十五万公顷。同时，降雨量却又不足，全国土地都需要灌溉。因此，兴修水利的工作十分重要。目前全国有水浇地十一万公顷，解放后才出现的。
    鲍·斯比里顿不久以前曾经率领罗马尼亚水利代表团到中国参观了四十五天，他对记者说，“中国水利方面的跃进真正感动了我们，我们的水利工作将受到中国的影响”。他还谈到罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡对于中国兴修水利的经验的重视。
