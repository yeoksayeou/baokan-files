    An Indictment of Eisenhower
    Zhao Shuli
    Living in America, you go elsewhere to steal people,
    It's been your lifelong occupation.
    Stealing people is the nature of a robber,
    One more robber like you doesn't matter much.
    The people of the world see it very clearly,
    Why bother with your evasions and trickery?
    What do you mean by "protecting nationals"?
    Every country has people who go abroad to make a living,
    And every country has foreign nationals residing there.
    There is no such international regulation,
    Saying "whichever country has nationals isn't allowed to have a revolution."
    In the 18th century, the British army protected nationals in your homeland.
    Your country was born in that revolution.
    Your ancestors enjoyed the glory of revolution,
    Who would have thought that in less than two hundred years, such an unfilial descendant like you would be born,
    Hearing about revolution makes you swollen with anger,
    Not afraid of letting down your ancestors!
    What do you mean by "invited"?
    In the past, it was just Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek
    —a few lapdogs yapping a few times,
    Today, Syngman hasn’t even cleared his throat,
    And you are already dispatching troops like an ant on a hot pot.
    Asking the American people for money and people,
    Forming an army, navy, and air force specifically for hire,
    Isn't that a marvel of ancient and modern times?
    Ask the broad masses of the American people,
    Are they willing to pay and die for those few lapdogs of yours?
    Stop evading and acting smart!
    "Covering your ears while stealing a bell" is the epitome of foolishness!
    The people of the world are extending you another kind of invitation:
    Please get your troops out of other people's lands quickly!
    This is an earth-shattering cry,
    If you dare to turn a deaf ear,
    Your final fate will be decided by the people of the world!
      July 1958, Changzhi, Shanxi

    家住美国到别处去抢人，
    是你一辈子的营生。
    抢人原是强盗的本性，
    强盗中多你一个也算不了甚。
    全世界人民看得非常分明，
    何须你东拉西扯弄鬼装神？
    说什么“保护侨民”？
    哪个国家也有人到外国谋生，
    哪个国家也住有外国的侨民。
    没听说有过这样的国际规定，
    说“哪一国有了侨民就不准革命”。
    十八世纪的英军曾在你们家乡保护过侨民。
    你们的国家就在那次革命中诞生。
    你们的祖先享受革命的光荣，
    想不到未满二百年就生下你这不肖儿孙
    听说人家革命就气得脸肿鼻青，
    全不怕替你的祖宗败兴！
    说什么“受人邀请”？
    往日不过是李承晚、蒋中正
    ——几只巴儿狗汪汪了几声，
    今日的夏蒙还没有来得及打扫嗓门，
    就急得像热锅上蚂蚁遣将调兵。
    向美国人民要钱要人，
    组成了陆海空军专供出聘，
    难道不是古今奇闻？
    问一问美国的广大人民，
    愿不愿为你那几条巴儿狗纳款、卖命？
    再不要东拉西扯自作聪明！
    “掩耳盗铃”才是典型的愚蠢！
    全世界人民向你发出另一种邀请：
    请你们的军队从别人的国土上快滚！
    这是山崩地裂的呼声，
    你要敢于充耳不听，
    你最后的命运要由全世界人民来决定！
      1958年7月于山西长治
