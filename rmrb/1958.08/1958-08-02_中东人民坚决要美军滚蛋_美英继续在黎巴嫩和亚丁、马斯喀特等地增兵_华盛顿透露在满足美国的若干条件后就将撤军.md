Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from Beirut: Many leaflets demanding that the American aggressor troops get out of Lebanon were discovered today in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.

These leaflets condemned the United States as "new colonialists" and demanded that "Americans go home today." The leaflets stated that the Lebanese people would continue to fight until the American occupation forces withdrew and Chamoun resigned.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from Damascus: According to a report in today's "Al-Nour," the Damascus authorities received hundreds of petitions and telegrams signed by about 100,000 people, angrily condemning the American and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and expressing their willingness to fight alongside the Lebanese and Jordanian people to drive out the invaders and cleanse the Arab land defiled by them. They demanded the conscription of volunteers to complete this sacred task.

According to a "Al-Nour" reporter, the citizens of Latakia held a meeting to discuss the seriousness of the situation and the mobilization of the people for self-defense. Various social groups in the town, after contacting the magistrate, held a meeting at the invitation of the magistrate to form various committees, including a women's committee, and mobilize the people to deal with the imminent danger.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from Beirut: The United States today sent another batch of invading troops to land on the coast near Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.

A US military spokesman said that no statement would be issued about this batch of troops until the landing operation was completed in a few days. He only said that these troops were coming to support the US forces in Lebanon. News said that this landing force belonged to the US Army's 24th Division.

The US Embassy in Lebanon issued a statement on the evening of July 31st stating that "so far, there are no military plans to put any American troops here back on board or redeploy them." It also said that there were no plans to stop supplying the joint command of the US Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force that landed in Lebanon two weeks ago.

From the conversations of US officials in Washington, it can be seen that the American aggressors are attempting to continue their armed occupation of Lebanon in order to obtain more guarantees of US control over Lebanon. They said that although presidential elections have been held in Lebanon, "several other conditions must be met before the work of withdrawing American troops can begin." Some US military officials even openly clamored that the US troops would only withdraw from Lebanon after the Lebanese rebel forces were "disarmed." According to the diplomatic correspondent of the London "Times," the United States and Britain are prepared to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan only if the "United Nations provides appropriate guarantees."

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from London: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced in the House of Commons on July 31st that the British government would "help strengthen" the armed forces of the Sultan of Muscat, and that the term of the British Air Force's use of its airfield in Muscat would be extended.

The Sultanate of Muscat is located in the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula, guarding the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Britain established colonial rule in Muscat in the nineteenth century, and now Muscat is a British "protectorate." Since the American and British aggressor troops occupied Lebanon and Jordan, Britain has been increasing troops in areas such as Aden and Muscat.

Lloyd said in the House of Commons that Britain would send "necessary (military) personnel" to Muscat for "support" and would "establish a small air force" for Muscat.

Lloyd also said that the Sultan of Muscat had "agreed" to extend the current arrangements regarding the use of Salalah and Masirah airfields by the British Air Force and civil aviation. In addition, the British government will also help build roads and other infrastructure within this Sultanate.

Lloyd said that the form of assistance he was talking about would be an annual grant to cover the Sultan of Muscat's armed forces' main and recurring expenses. This will amount to approximately £400,000 in the current fiscal year.

Lloyd said that the British government would also provide the Sultan of Muscat's armed forces with stores and supplies for "current security measures."

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch: A United Press International reporter dispatch from London said that news reaching London indicated that the situation in Amman was becoming increasingly tense. The Jordanian government had already implemented strict censorship of all news reports and, starting from July 30th, had also prohibited non-official telephone calls abroad. He also said that King Hussein of Jordan was struggling desperately to hold on to his throne, and Hussein's troops were enforcing "de facto martial law" throughout the country.

The reporter revealed that the United States, Britain, and the other remaining members of the "Baghdad Pact" were plotting "some kind of arrangement by the United Nations to protect Jordan" so that American troops could invade Jordan under the guise of the United Nations and enable American and British troops to occupy Jordan for a long time. He also said that Western authorities believe that the West must do everything possible to support the Hussein regime, which is extremely hated by the Jordanian people, including providing economic "aid." The United States has already given $12 million in economic "aid."

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Jerusalem, when US Presidential "Envoy" Murphy, who was engaged in conspiratorial activities in Amman on July 30th, arrived in Jerusalem the next day, he whitewashed the Hussein dynasty, saying that the situation in Jordan was "tending towards stability," but he immediately added, "I personally say this with some reservations." However, the Associated Press admitted in the same report that other people from Jordan said that the situation in Jordan was tense and that Hussein was continuing to carry out large-scale arrests. A Kyodo News Agency reporter's dispatch from Amman on July 31st said that the gasoline shortage in Jordan remained severe. He said that in Amman, the phenomenon of cars queuing for hours in front of gas stations could be seen everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from Tel Aviv: US Presidential "Envoy" Murphy ran to Israel from Jordan on the 31st to engage in conspiratorial activities. He held talks with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for more than an hour.

A communiqué issued after the talks said: "They conducted a useful exchange of information, during which a broad study of the Middle East situation was also made." Earlier, news said that this American conspirator went to Israel to discuss with the Israeli Prime Minister and Foreign Minister the issue of airlifting American troops to Jordan through Israeli airspace.

The Israeli "People's Voice" said that Murphy's visit was "new evidence proving that the Ben-Gurion government is involved in the Anglo-American aggression against the Near East."

Prior to this, the Damascus "Victory" reported that Murphy visited Jordan after Hussein made a "request" to the United States to send American troops to "protect" him. Washington instructed Murphy to visit Jordan and discuss the situation there in order to determine what measures the United States could take to meet Hussein's "request."

    中东人民坚决要美军滚蛋
    美英继续在黎巴嫩和亚丁、马斯喀特等地增兵
    华盛顿透露在满足美国的若干条件后就将撤军
    新华社1日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特今天发现了许多要求美国侵略军从黎巴嫩滚出去的传单。
    这些传单谴责美国是“新的殖民主义者”，并且要求“美国人今天就滚回家去”。传单说，黎巴嫩人民将继续战斗到美国占领军撤退和夏蒙辞职为止。
    新华社大马士革1日电　据“光明报”今天报道，大马士革当局收到由约十万人签名的好几百份请愿书和电报，愤怒地谴责了美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，并且表示愿意同黎巴嫩人民和约旦人民一起并肩作战，赶走侵略者和清洗被他们玷污的阿拉伯土地。他们要求征集志愿军来完成这个神圣的任务。
    据“光明报”记者报道，拉塔基亚的市民们举行了会议，讨论了局势的严重性和动员人民进行自卫的问题。镇上的各个社会团体在同长官接触后，应长官的邀请举行了会议，来组成包括妇女委员会在内的各种委员会，并且动员人民来对付势在燃眉的危险。
    新华社1日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国今天又派出一批侵略军部队在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特附近海岸登陆。
    一名美军发言人说，在几天以内登陆行动结束以前不会发表关于这批部队的任何声明。他只是说，这批部队是来支援美国在黎巴嫩的部队的。有消息说，这批登陆部队是属于美国陆军第二十四师的。
    美国驻黎巴嫩大使馆在7月31日晚上发表声明说，“到目前为止，并没有使这里的任何美国军队重新上船或者重新部署的军事计划。”它还说，目前还没有停止对两个星期以前在黎巴嫩登陆的美国陆军、海军、海军陆战队和空军的联合司令部供应物资的计划。
    从华盛顿的美国官员的谈话中可以看出，美国侵略者企图继续武装侵占黎巴嫩，以取得更多的美国控制黎巴嫩的保证。他们说，虽然黎巴嫩已经举行了总统选举，但是，“必须先满足若干其他条件，撤退美军的工作才能够开始”。有的美军官员还公然叫嚷要在黎巴嫩起义部队“解除武装”以后，美国军队才会撤出黎巴嫩。据伦敦“泰晤士报”的外交记者说，美英两国要“联合国提供适当的保证”才准备撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德7月31日在下院宣布，英国政府将“帮助加强”马斯喀特苏丹国苏丹的武装部队，并且英国空军使用它在马斯喀特的机场的期限将延长。
    马斯喀特苏丹国在阿拉伯半岛东北部，扼波斯湾口。英国在十九世纪就在马斯喀特建立了殖民统治，现在马斯喀特是英国的“保护国”。自从美英侵略军占领黎巴嫩和约旦以来，英国一直在亚丁、马斯喀特等地区增兵。
    劳埃德在下院说，英国将派“必要的（军事）人员”去马斯喀特“支援”，并且要为马斯喀特“建立一支小小的空军”。
    劳埃德还说，马斯喀特苏丹已经“同意”延长目前的关于英国空军和民航利用萨拉拉和马西拉机场的安排。另外，英国政府还将帮助在这个苏丹国内建筑公路等。
    劳埃德说，他所说的援助的形式将是每年给予赠款以支付马斯喀特苏丹的武装部队主要的和经常的费用。在目前的财政年度中这将达约四十万镑。
    劳埃德说，英国政府还将为马斯喀特苏丹的武装部队提供储藏品和供应品以供“目前的安全措施”之用。
    新华社1日电　合众国际社记者从伦敦发出的消息说，传到伦敦的消息表明，安曼的情况越来越紧张，约旦政府本来已经对一切新闻报道实行严格检查，从7月30日开始又禁止向国外打非官方的电话。他还说，约旦国王侯赛因正在拚命为保住王位而挣扎，侯赛因的军队在全国执行着“事实上的戒严”。
    这位记者透露，美国、英国和“巴格达条约”的其它残余的成员国正在策划“由联合国做出保护约旦的某种安排”，以便让美国军队在联合国的幌子下侵入约旦并且使美英军队得以长期侵占约旦。他还说，西方权威人士认为，西方必须尽一切可能支持遭到约旦人民极端仇视的侯赛因政权，包括给予经济“援助”，美国已经给了一千二百万美元的经济“援助”。
    另据美联社耶路撒冷消息，在7月30日到安曼进行阴谋活动的美国总统“特使”墨菲在第二天到达耶路撒冷时，为侯赛因小王朝粉饰太平说，约旦局势“正在趋向稳定”，但是他紧接着又说，“我个人这样说时还有点保留”。而美联社在同一条消息中却承认，其他从约旦来的人说，约旦的局势是紧张的，侯赛因在继续进行大规模的逮捕。共同社记者7月31日从安曼发回的消息说，约旦汽油荒仍然严重。他说，在安曼，汽车在汽油供应站前面排队等几个小时的现象到处都可以看到。
    新华社1日讯　特拉维夫消息：美国总统“特使”墨菲31日从约旦跑到以色列进行阴谋活动，他同以色列总理戴维·本—古里安进行了一个多小时的会谈。
    会谈后发表的公报说：“他们进行了一次有益的情报交换，在这当中还对中东局势作了广泛的研究。”早些时候有消息说，这个美国阴谋家到以色列，是为了同以色列总理和外长讨论经过以色列领空空运美国军队到约旦的问题。
    以色列“人民呼声报”说，墨菲的访问是“一个新的证据，证明本—古里安政府参与英美对近东的侵略”。
    在这以前，大马士革的“胜利报”曾经报道，墨菲是在侯赛因向美国提出派美军“保护”他的“要求”以后访问约旦的，华盛顿指令墨菲访问约旦，并且讨论那里的局势，以便确定美国能够采取什么办法来满足侯赛因的“要求”。
