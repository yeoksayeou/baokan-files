Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: A great leap forward in cultural education has emerged in minority areas across the country. Many minority nationalities have already shed their generations-long state of illiteracy, and a large number of minority youth and children are enthusiastically learning Chinese language and script.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now entered a new stage of eliminating illiteracy and universalizing primary school education in entire counties and cities. Everywhere, whether in grasslands, rural areas, or towns, one can see literacy boards, cultural stations, and cultural posts. According to statistics from sixty counties and cities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, 546 agricultural middle schools have been established in the past two months, exceeding the original number of junior high schools in the region by 4.7 times. Seventeen counties and cities have basically universalized primary school education. In the Liuzhou, Yongning, and Baise Special Zones in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities, more than 390,000 new children have enrolled in schools. In minority areas of Yunnan Province, more than 30 counties have basically universalized middle school education. In the Guizhou Province's Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and Qian Nan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, 90% of school-age children have entered schools.

The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, which universalized primary school education as early as last year, has now realized the grand plan of having a university in every township.

In order to benefit the development of nationalities and the socialist construction of the motherland, the masses in many ethnic minority areas are urgently requesting that schools, in addition to teaching in their own ethnic languages, also teach Chinese language and script. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has already opened Chinese language courses in schools at all levels. In recent years, junior high schools and high schools have devoted some time to teaching in Chinese language and script. In the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, almost all of the more than 100,000 Tujia and Miao students in over 3,700 primary schools can speak Chinese, and most can also speak fluent Mandarin. Primary school students in the Tibet region also have a great interest in learning Chinese language and script. Fifth-grade students in Lhasa's No. 1 and No. 2 Primary Schools can understand Chinese lectures without translation.

　　摆脱世世代代文盲状态
    少数民族地区文化教育大跃进
    据新华社28日讯　全国少数民族地区出现了文化教育大跃进的局面。有许多少数民族已经摆脱了世世代代的文盲状态，广大少数民族青年儿童还热情地学习汉文汉语。
    内蒙古自治区目前已进入整县整市扫除文盲和普及小学教育的新阶段，无论草原、农村和城镇，到处可以看到识字牌、文化站和文化岗。新疆维吾尔自治区据六十个县、市的统计，两个月来已建立农业中学五百四十六所，超过全区原有初中数的四点七倍，并有十七个县市基本上普及了小学教育。广西僮族自治区少数民族聚居的柳州、邕宁、百色三个专区，新入学的儿童有三十九万多名。云南省少数民族地区，已有三十多个县基本上普及了中学教育。贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州和黔南布依族苗族自治州适龄儿童有90％进了学校。
    早在去年就普及小学教育的延边朝鲜族自治州，现在又实现了乡乡有大学的宏伟计划。
    为了有利于民族的发展和祖国的社会主义建设，许多民族地区的群众，迫切要求学校除了用本民族的语文教学外，还要教汉文汉语。延边朝鲜族自治州早已在各级学校开设了汉语课。最近几年来，初中和高中都有一部分时间用汉族语文教学。湘西土家族苗族自治州的三千七百多所小学，十万多土家族、苗族学生几乎人人都能说汉话，大部分还能讲流利的普通话。西藏地区的小学生对学习汉族语文也有很大兴趣，拉萨第一、第二小学五年级的学生，不需要翻译就能听懂汉语讲课。
