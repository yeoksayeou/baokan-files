Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 27th: Our reporter reports: The communiqué issued by the Hong Kong British authorities on the 26th regarding the forced closure of the Chung Wah Middle School, the assault on its teachers and students, and the assault on Chinese journalists is full of lies. It attempts to shirk the serious responsibility it should bear for creating this bloody atrocity.

This communiqué was hastily issued by the Hong Kong British authorities at noon on the same day after armed police were dispatched yesterday morning to forcibly seal off the Chung Wah Middle School and create a bloody incident. This "communiqué," over a thousand words long, does not mention a single word about the fact that Hong Kong police viciously beat teachers, students, and journalists covering the event. The "communiqué" falsely claims, "The police expelled the ringleaders from the school, and the rest followed voluntarily." But the fact is that Hong Kong armed police violently threw the teachers and students remaining in the school building out one by one and row by row, some even being choked, their hands tied behind their backs and thrown hard, injuring them as they hit the stone steps. Hong Kong police pushed a female student named Yang Yuqing to the ground and kicked her, wielding thick batons to beat her. The bloodstains on teachers such as Deng Tongyuan and Liang Zhiqiu, the scars on the face of Ta Kung Pao reporter Zhang Guangliang, and the injuries of more than twenty other teachers and students who were viciously beaten, as well as many photos taken on the spot of the British police committing violence, are enough to bankrupt this "communiqué."

The Hong Kong British authorities' "communiqué" also says that only one team of seventy police officers was sent to Chung Wah Middle School to carry out the "closure order." This is another clumsy lie. The fact is that the Hong Kong police, ordered to commit violence, were transported in ten large police vehicles and one police vehicle equipped with radio command equipment, and several private cars also carried "plainclothes" police officers. There were already more than one hundred armed police officers deployed at the entrance of Chung Wah Middle School alone. Photos taken by reporters are ironclad evidence that no lies can deny. Obviously, the intention of the Hong Kong British authorities in issuing the communiqué is nothing more than to minimize the impact of their bloody atrocities.

Almost half of the Hong Kong British authorities' communiqué boasts that they took care of both the "danger" of the Chung Wah Middle School building and the students' studies. But people will ask: Why has Chung Wah Middle School repeatedly requested assistance from the Education Department to solve the school building problem but been refused? Why has the Public Works Department repeatedly and deliberately delayed approving the repair drawings that they deemed satisfactory, preventing the school from repairing the building? And why did the Education Department so early "advise" the principal of Chung Wah Middle School to have their students "transfer to other schools"? Obviously, this is a pre-arranged conspiracy by the Hong Kong British authorities. The Hong Kong Education Department, Public Works Department, court, and police station colluded together, with the Public Works Department coming forward to "apply" to the court for closure on the pretext of "dangerous school buildings." After the court "ruled" for closure, the police station executed it. Then, the Education Department could invoke the so-called "Education Amendment Ordinance" to cancel the school's registration. This is a complete set of persecution plans by the Hong Kong authorities against Chung Wah Middle School: first close the school building, then cancel the school.

People see this fact: since the Hong Kong authorities' court issued the so-called "closure order," more than a thousand people have gone to Chung Wah Middle School every day to express their sympathy; in Hong Kong, only a few hours after the incident of forcibly beating teachers, students, and reporters occurred, the number of people from all walks of life who went to express their sympathy increased to more than four thousand; today is the second day after the incident, and the number of people braving strong winds and heavy rain to express their sympathy has increased to more than eight thousand. This precisely shows that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong sympathize with Chung Wah Middle School, that they all stand on the side of justice, and that the Chinese people of Hong Kong cannot be intimidated! If the Hong Kong British authorities dare to continue to persecute Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, then they will reap the bitter fruit of their own actions. (Attached pictures)

　　两幅逞凶照片　一记清脆耳光
    无情的事实粉碎香港英国当局公报的谎言
    新华社广州27日电　本社记者报道：香港英国当局26日就强行封闭中华中学校舍、殴辱中华中学师生和中国新闻记者事件发表的公报全是谎话，它企图推卸制造这一血腥暴行所应负的严重责任。
    这份公报是香港英国当局在昨晨出动了武装警察、强封中华中学校舍、制造了血案之后，匆匆忙忙在当天午间发表的。这个一千多字的“公报”没有一个字提到香港警察凶殴教师、学生和在场采访记者的事实。“公报”诳说：“警方驱逐为首数人出校，其余自动追随而去。”但事实是香港武装警察把留在校舍的教师、学生一个个和一排排地用暴力摔出门外，有的还被卡着脖子，反扣双手用力猛摔，撞在石阶上受伤。香港警察把一个叫杨玉清的女学生推倒后还用脚踢她，挥动粗大的警棍打她。而邓统元、梁治球等教师身上的血迹，大公报记者张光亮脸部的伤痕和其他二十多个师生被凶殴的伤痕，以及许多当场拍摄的英警行凶的照片已经足够使这个“公报”破产了。
    香港英国当局的“公报”还说：只派了警察一队七十人前往中华中学执行“封闭令”。这又是一个笨拙的谎言，事实是奉命行凶的香港警察是由十部大型警车和一部有无线电指挥设备的警车装载着，还有几个私家车装载了“便衣”警察，单是在中华中学门口布防的武装警察，就已超过一百人，记者拍摄得来的照片就是铁的证据，任何谎言都无法抵赖。显然，香港英国当局发表公报的企图，无非是为他们的血腥暴行缩小影响。
    香港英国当局的公报几乎有一大半是吹嘘他们既照顾到中华中学校舍的“危险”，又关心到学生的学业。但是人们会问：为什么中华中学屡次向教育司要求协助解决校舍问题却遭到拒绝？为什么工务局屡次有意拖延批复业经他们认为满意的修建图样，不让学校进行校舍修建？又为什么教育司那么早就“劝告”中华中学校长，要他们的学生“转学”？显然，这是香港英国当局预先安排好的阴谋，香港教育司、工务局、法庭和警察局串通一气，由工务局出面以“校舍危险”为借口，向法庭“申请”封闭，法庭“判决”封闭后由警察局执行，然后，教育司就可以引用所谓“教育修正条例”，取消学校的注册。这是香港当局对中华中学先封闭校舍、再取消学校的整套迫害计划。
    人们看到这个事实：从香港当局的法庭发出所谓“封闭令”以后，每天都有一千人以上前往中华中学慰问；在香港用武力殴打教师、学生和记者的事件发生后不过几小时，社会各界人士前往慰问的就增加到四千多人；今天是事件发生后的第二天，冒强风大雨去慰问的更增加到八千多人。这正好说明：香港各界人士都同情中华中学，他们都站在正义的一边，香港中国人民是吓不倒的！如果香港英国当局胆敢仍继续对香港中国同胞肆行迫害，那么，它将会自食其恶果。（附图片）
