Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 20th: Fujian's more than 1.1 million mu of peanuts will increase its unit yield by about double compared to last year. Following high yields of 3,000 jin, 5,000 jin, 8,000 jin, and over 10,000 jin per mu, many peanut "thousand-jin communes and thousand-jin townships" have emerged, leading to large-scale high yields in entire counties and even a special district. The Jinjiang Special District, which accounts for about half of the province's total peanut planting area, has harvested 261,358 mu of peanuts, yielding a total of 1,370,269 dan of dry peanuts, exceeding the total output of more than 680,000 mu of peanuts in the entire district last year by more than 250,000 dan, with an average yield of 524 jin per mu, an increase of more than 2.2 times compared to last year's average yield of 163 jin per mu. In Nan'an County, within this special district, 72,412 mu of peanuts have been planted, with 68,743 mu already harvested, averaging 614 jin per mu, an increase of more than two times compared to last year's yield of 183 jin per mu. Jinjiang County, with a peanut planting area of more than 110,000 mu, has harvested more than 68,000 mu, with an average yield of more than 600 jin per mu, an increase of nearly three times compared to last year. The Yinghu Cooperative of Longhu Township in this county, which set a high-yield record of more than 13,000 jin per mu, has harvested 252 mu of peanuts, with an average yield reaching more than 2,106 jin per mu.

Recently, the provincial agricultural departments and the county Party committees, based on the yield statistics and comprehensive estimates of large-area harvests in various regions, have determined that the total output and average unit yield of more than 1.1 million mu of peanuts in the province will increase by about double compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 19th: Success Township in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, has once again set a high-yield record for peanuts. Recently, the members of the first team of the third production brigade of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in this township harvested 15,875 jin of dry peanuts from a 1.01 mu experimental plot, averaging 15,717 jin per mu.

This high-yield experimental plot was planted under the leadership of Zheng Shichen, the Party branch secretary of the Heping Cooperative, and Zheng Shizai, the team leader, along with all the team members.
