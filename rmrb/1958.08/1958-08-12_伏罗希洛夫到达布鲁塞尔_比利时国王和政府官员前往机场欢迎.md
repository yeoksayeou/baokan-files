Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, dispatch from Brussels via TASS, August 10th: Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, arrived in Brussels on a “Tu-104” special plane on the 10th in order to participate in the celebration of the Soviet Day at the World Expo.

Voroshilov and the accompanying Soviet Minister of Health Kovrigina and First Deputy Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, Kaftanov, were welcomed at the airport by King Baudouin of Belgium and Belgian government officials.

Belgian newspapers particularly pointed out that Voroshilov's arrival in Brussels is the first visit by a Soviet head of state to a Western European country. The editorial of "Le Peuple" stated that the victory of the Soviet people in the war against Hitler's aggression greatly promoted the liberation of the peoples of European countries from Nazi oppression and Pan-Germanism. We believe that the Russian people only desire peace. We believe that the Soviet head of state can be assured during his brief visit to Belgium of the strong desire of the Belgian people for peace and peaceful coexistence.

Belgium's largest newspaper, "Le Soir," wrote that Marshal Voroshilov can see with his own eyes how strong the memory of the Belgian people is of the heroic struggle of the Russian people against the Nazi army and Hitler's ambition to dominate the world.

　　伏罗希洛夫到达布鲁塞尔
　　比利时国王和政府官员前往机场欢迎
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔10日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫在10日乘“图—104”专机抵达布鲁塞尔，以便参加庆祝世界博览会上的苏联日。
    伏罗希洛夫和随行的苏联卫生部长科夫里金娜、苏联文化部第一副部长卡弗坦诺夫在机场上受到比利时国王博杜安和比利时政府官员的欢迎。
    比利时报纸特别指出，伏罗希洛夫的到达布鲁塞尔，是苏联国家元首的第一次访问西欧国家。“人民报”的社论说，苏联人民在反对希特勒的侵略战争中的胜利，在很大程度上促进了欧洲各国人民摆脱纳粹的压迫和泛日尔曼主义。我们相信，俄国人民只希望和平。我们相信，苏联元首在比利时短暂的访问期间可以确信比利时人民渴望和平与和平共处的强烈愿望。
    比利时最大的报纸“晚报”写道，伏罗希洛夫元帅可以亲眼看到：比利时人民对俄国人民反对纳粹军队和希特勒称霸世界的野心的英勇斗争，保持着多么强烈的记忆。
