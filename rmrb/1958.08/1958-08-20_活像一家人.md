Just Like a Family
　　Around noon, Zhang Suzhen, who was in charge of production management, informed everyone that today's production task had to be completed before 2:30 PM. Because the content of this batch of loose-leaf pages was "On Contradiction," the Red Star Binding Factory proposed that the binding should be completed ahead of schedule to facilitate everyone's study.
　　After lunch, everyone started working together spontaneously. Seeing that it was almost 2 o'clock, Wang Baokun, who was pregnant, still had many loose-leaf pages to fold, so Wang Yuhua took the initiative to help her. Fu Guiying was a novice with less skilled techniques, so comrades who had already completed their tasks helped her with a final push. When the production team leader went to the Red Star Binding Factory to deliver the finished product, it was exactly 2:30 PM.
　　Before the organization, helping others required wages and rewards. Now it's different; everyone sees unity and mutual assistance as very common. As they themselves said, "After being organized, it's just like a family!"

　　活像一家人
    快到中午十二点钟的时候，管理生产的张素贞通知大家说：今天的生产任务，要在下午两点半以前完成。因为这批活页的内容是“矛盾论”，为了配合大家的学习，红星装订厂提出一定要提前装订好。
    吃过午饭，大家便不约而同地干了起来。眼看快到两点钟了，孕妇王保昆还有不少活页未折好，王玉花便主动去帮助她；傅桂英是个新手，技术不太熟练，已经完成任务的同志，便帮她突击。当生产组长去红星装订厂交活的时候，正是两点半。
    在未组织起来前，要帮别人的忙，还要工资报酬。现在可不同了，大家都把团结互助看成很平常的事情。正如她们自己说的：“组织起来后就像一家人！”
