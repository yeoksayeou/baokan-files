　　Unmasked Ambition
　　By Our Commentator
    Just days ago, the United Nations General Assembly's emergency special session passed a resolution demanding the early withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. However, the ink on this resolution was barely dry when, far from showing any signs of retreat, the American invading forces launched new provocations in Lebanon. On August 25th, American invading troops' tank units suddenly surrounded the Basta district of the Lebanese capital, controlled by the insurgent people, while its artillery units occupied positions opposite the insurgent army. U.S. Marines and tank units also built fortifications around the Basta district, threatening to "clean up" the insurgent people's strongholds. Fifteen more warships have newly arrived in Lebanon. Meanwhile, according to a leaflet secretly distributed by officers of the U.S. invasion forces in Lebanon, the U.S. occupation forces, under orders from higher authorities, will stay in Lebanon for the long term, establish two atomic bases and five rocket bases in Lebanon, and transport large quantities of atomic weapons to Lebanon.
  The objectives of these outrageous activities by the American invaders are very clear. The Basta district of Beirut is an important stronghold controlled by the Lebanese insurgents and is the front line of their opposition to the traitorous Shamun regime. The American invading army's sudden encirclement of this area is a direct threat to the Lebanese insurgents. And everyone knows that the Lebanese insurgent forces have consistently insisted on the immediate withdrawal of American troops. In the eyes of the American invaders, as long as the insurgents' resistance is suppressed, it will be easier for them to delay their withdrawal, establish new invasion springboards and atomic bases in the Middle East, and seize the opportunity to expand their aggression.
    The new provocations by the American invaders in Lebanon further expose the various "excuses" it used when it invaded Lebanon. We ask, is the encirclement of the Basta district for the sake of "American welfare"? Is the construction of atomic bases in Lebanon for the sake of "protecting American expatriates"? In fact, from the day the American invaders invaded Lebanon, they harbored the most arrogant ambitions of aggression and have never given up. The United States' acceptance of the proposal put forward by the ten Arab countries at the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly was obviously forced. Dulles said something at the UN General Assembly meeting on August 21st that actually revealed that the United States had ulterior motives. He said: "Please allow me to emphasize that no proposal, in itself, will solve the problems of the Near East. These problems have very deep roots. These problems cannot be easily eradicated. These problems have explosive aspects that can come as a surprise to us at any time. No resolution of the General Assembly itself can solve these problems." What exactly are the "problems" that Dulles wants to solve? Now it has been revealed that it is to suppress the rising national liberation struggle in the Middle East. Dulles is of course very clear in his mind that it is not possible to solve this "problem" by relying on the United Nations General Assembly, so he can only rely on American tanks, airplanes, and artillery. However, Dulles's plan has long been declared bankrupt. There is no way to solve Dulles's "problem," and the national liberation struggle in the Middle East must achieve final victory.
    The American invading army's provocative action of encircling the Basta district of Beirut shows that the United States is preparing to fundamentally undermine the resolution of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly. These activities cannot but intensify the tense situation in Lebanon and the Middle East, creating a new threat to the cause of peace. It is very clear that the more days the American and British invading armies stay in the Middle East, the more days of danger and the more days of harm there will be. The people of the Middle East and the world must be vigilant and wage a stronger struggle to implement the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly and to demand the immediate withdrawal of the American and British invading armies from Lebanon and Jordan, and they must not give up until this goal is achieved!

    几天以前，联合国大会紧急特别会议刚刚通过决议要求美英军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，但是这个决议的墨迹未干，美国侵略军竟不但没有撤退的迹象，反而在黎巴嫩进行新的挑衅。8月25日，美国侵略军的坦克部队突然包围了黎巴嫩首都起义人民控制的巴斯塔区，它的炮兵部队占据了起义军对面的阵地。美国海军陆战队和坦克部队并且在巴斯塔区的周围修筑工事，扬言要“肃清”起义人民的据点。还有十五艘军舰，新开到了黎巴嫩。同时，据侵黎美军军官秘密散发的一张传单透露，美国占领军根据上级的命令，要长期呆在黎巴嫩，要在黎巴嫩建立两个原子基地和五个火箭基地，并且要把大批原子武器运到黎巴嫩去。
  美国侵略者的这些猖狂的活动想要达到什么目的，是非常明显的。贝鲁特的巴斯塔区是黎巴嫩起义人民控制的重要据点，是他们反对夏蒙卖国政权的前沿阵地，美国侵略军突然包围这个地方，就是要直接威胁黎巴嫩起义者。而谁都知道，黎巴嫩起义部队是一直坚持要美军立即撤退的。在美国侵略者看来，只要压服了起义者的反抗，就会便于它拖延撤军，并在中东建立新的侵略跳板和原子基地，伺机扩大侵略行动。
    美国侵略者在黎巴嫩的新的挑衅，进一步揭穿了它侵入黎巴嫩时的种种“借口”。试问，包围巴斯塔区，难道是为了“美国的福利”吗？在黎巴嫩修建原子基地，难道是为了“保护美国侨民”吗？事实上，美国侵略者从侵入黎巴嫩的一天起，就怀抱着最狂妄的侵略野心，始终没有放弃。在联合国大会紧急特别会议上美国接受十个阿拉伯国家所提的提案，显然是被迫的。杜勒斯在8月21日联大会议上说过一段话，实际上道出了美国是别有用心的。他说：“请允许我着重指出，任何提案、其本身是不会解决近东问题的。这些问题是有很深的根源的。这些问题是不能轻易根除的。这些问题具有随时能够出乎我们意料之外的一触即发的方面。大会的任何决议的本身都不能解决这些问题。”杜勒斯所要解决的“问题”究竟是什么呢？现在已经漏底了，那就是要镇压中东的日益高涨的民族解放斗争。杜勒斯心里当然非常清楚，靠联合国大会来解决这个“问题”是不行的，于是只有靠美国的坦克、飞机和大炮。但是，杜勒斯的这种打算早就宣告破产了。杜勒斯的“问题”是没有任何办法可以解决的，中东的民族解放斗争一定要取得最后胜利。
    美国侵略军包围贝鲁特巴斯塔区的挑衅行动，表明美国正准备根本破坏联合国大会紧急特别会议的决议。这些活动不能不加剧了黎巴嫩和中东的紧张局势，造成了对和平事业的新的威胁。非常明显，美国和英国侵略军在中东多留一天，就多一天的危险，多一天的祸害，中东和全世界人民必须提高警惕，为实现联合国大会的决议，为要求美英侵略军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦而进行更坚强的斗争，不达到这个目的，就不能罢休！
