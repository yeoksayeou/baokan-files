Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Tokyo Message: "Akahata" published an editorial today condemning the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique for creating tension in the Far East.

　　The editorial stated, "China's counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek clique's provocations in the Taiwan area is a matter of China exercising its sovereignty, and no foreign interference is allowed. At the same time, this is also a just action to crush American imperialism's aggression and defend peace in the Far East."

　　The editorial pointed out that the United States frequently creates tension in various regions of the world, and recently has intensified its provocations against China.

　　The editorial stated that its crazy anti-China policy can be seen from the "Memorandum" issued by the US State Department on August 11. In order to make China "collapse," the United States is not satisfied with "non-recognition of China" diplomatically, but also attempts to attack China by force. The United States once played the trick of invading China through Korea and Vietnam, but failed. Now it wants to use Taiwan as a bridge to attack China.

　　The editorial pointed out that since the United States' armed aggression against the Middle East, its preparations for attacking China have become increasingly intensified. US warships and Marines have sailed to the Western Pacific, and the United States has successively transferred the air forces of Okinawa and the Philippines to Taiwan. US Air Force and Chiang Kai-shek clique aircraft have repeatedly violated China. All of this confirms its conspiracy.

　　"Akahata" pointed out that China's decisive attitude towards the provocative behavior of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is absolutely necessary for defending peace in the Far East. When imperialists are trying to provoke new wars, peace cannot be maintained by wishful thinking alone. Peace can only be obtained through struggle. Peaceful forces must crush the aggressive actions of the imperialists with a resolute attitude in order to maintain peace.

　　日本“赤旗报”发表社论说：
　　坚决反击美国挑衅  就是保卫远东和平
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，谴责美国和蒋介石集团在远东制造紧张局势。
    社论说，“中国对蒋介石集团在台湾地区的挑衅进行了反击，这是属于中国行使主权的内政问题，绝不容许外国的任何干涉。同时，这也是粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和保卫远东和平的正义行动”。
    社论指出，美国经常在世界各个地区制造紧张局势，最近又加紧了对中国的挑衅。
    社论说，从美国国务院8月11日发表的“备忘录”中就能够看出它的疯狂的对华政策。为了使中国“崩溃”，美国不满足于在外交上“不承认中国”，还企图用武力进攻中国。美国曾经玩弄通过朝鲜和越南侵略中国的手段，都遭到了失败，现在又想以台湾为桥梁攻击中国。
    社论指出，自从美国武装侵略中东以来，它对中国的进攻准备越来越加紧了。美国军舰和海军陆战队开到西太平洋，美国把冲绳和菲律宾的空军陆续调到台湾，美国空军和蒋介石集团的飞机屡次侵犯中国，这些都证实了它的阴谋。
    “赤旗报”指出，中国对美国和蒋介石集团的挑衅行为采取了断然的态度，这对于保卫远东和平是绝对必要的。当帝国主义者正在企图挑起新战争的时候，只靠愿望是保不住和平的，和平只能依靠斗争才能获得，和平力量必须以坚决的态度粉碎帝国主义者的侵略行动，这样才能保得住和平。
