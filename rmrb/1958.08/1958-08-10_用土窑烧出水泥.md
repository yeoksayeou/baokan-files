    Firing Cement in Indigenous Kilns
    The Guiyang Cement Plant recently successfully test-fired high-grade cement in indigenous kilns, finding a new way to rapidly increase cement production.
    In mid-June, the plant loaded a four-meter-diameter indigenous kiln for a test firing. However, due to uneven batching, the areas with more coal were over-fired, while the areas with less coal were not fired thoroughly.
    In July, they loaded another six-meter-diameter indigenous kiln with twelve fire holes at the bottom. Both the coal and raw materials were adjusted to be very uniform, and the results were excellent: 50% of the cement fired was grade 400, 30% was grade 300, and only about 10% was not fired thoroughly.
    Firing cement in indigenous kilns is simple and easy, does not require electricity, the kiln construction does not require blueprints or design, and the firing technique is easy to master.

    用土窑烧出水泥
    贵阳水泥厂最近试用土窑烧出了高标号水泥，为迅速增产水泥找到了新途径。
    6月中旬，这个厂装了一口直径四公尺的土窑进行试烧。但是由于配料不均匀，结果煤多的地方烧透了，煤少的地方没烧透。
    7月份，他们又装了一口直径六公尺的土窑，下面开了十二个发火洞，煤和原料都调整得很均匀，结果很好：烧出的水泥四百号的占50％，三百号的占30％，只有10％左右没有烧透。
    用土窑烧水泥简便易行，不需要电力，建窑也不要绘图设计，烧制技术容易掌握。
