Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 26th: Beitaishe Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, has launched a large "satellite" of millet production, achieving a yield of 10,546.15 jin of dry millet per mu. This has restored the reputation of millet, which has always been considered a low-yield crop, liberated people's thinking, and set a banner for increasing the cultivation of this nutritious and easily stored grain in the future.

　　This millet was planted collectively in an experimental field by cadres of the Shou Zhang County People's Committee and members of the First Production Team of Beitaishe. It was harvested on August 22nd, and the acceptance was attended by more than ten people, including Si Zhendong, the county magistrate of the county, Guo Xianzai and Liu Dengjiu, the deputy county magistrates, and Gao Shiyun, the director of Beitaishe. The inspectors measured the land and confirmed that the area of ​​the experimental field was 1.007 mu. According to the calculation of millet threshing and weighing, a total of 11,285.4 jin of dry millet was harvested, equivalent to a yield of 10,546.15 jin per mu. During the acceptance, technician Cheng Yungong measured the millet plants with a ruler and found that they were as high as six feet, with the highest reaching seven feet. The ears were generally about eight inches long; the longest reached more than one foot, and the grains were plump. After threshing and weighing, the average size of each ear was one liang of dry millet.

　　Millet (粟)
　　Millet is one of the main coarse grain crops cultivated in northern China. This year, about 100 million mu of millet have been sown nationwide, most of which are concentrated in the north. In the north, millet is divided into spring millet and summer millet, the former being the majority.

　　In the past, the unit yield of millet was generally not very high. Last year, the national average yield per mu was 137 jin. Larger areas of high-yield fields produced more than 600 jin, and the highest yield was 1,441 jin.

　　Millet stems and leaves emit very little water and have a large regulating force, so they are very drought-resistant. Millet seeds (referring to those with skin) are more resistant to storage than other grains. Millet is rich in nutrition and has a special flavor. In many areas of the north, it is listed as a treasure among grains.

　　Millet stalks (i.e., millet grass) also contain more nutrients than similar crop stalks and are a valuable fodder.

　　谷子跃过万斤
    寿张北台社亩产10546斤
    据新华社济南26日电　山东省寿张县城关乡北台农业社放出一颗谷子大“卫星”，亩产干谷一万零五百四十六斤十五两。这对一向被称为低产作物的谷子恢复了名誉，解放了人们的思想，并为今后增种这种既富营养又易储存的谷子树立了旗帜。
    这块谷子是寿张县人民委员会的机关干部和北台社第一生产队的社员集体种的试验田。8月22日收割，参加验收的有该县县长司振东、副县长郭贤斋、刘登九，北台社主任高士云等十多人。验收人员丈量了土地证实试验田的面积是一亩零七厘，根据谷子脱粒过秤计算，共收干谷一万一千二百八十五斤四两，折合亩产一万零五百四十六斤十五两。在验收中，技术员程云功用尺子量了谷棵，高达六尺，最高的达七尺。穗子一般的都在八寸左右；最长的达一尺以上，而且谷粒饱满，经过脱粒过秤，大小穗平均每个折干谷一两整。谷子（粟）
    谷子是我国北方地区栽培的主要杂粮作物的一种。今年全国播种的一亿亩左右谷子，大部分集中在北方。在北方，谷子分春谷、夏谷，前者居多。
    谷子过去的单位产量一般是不太高的，去年全国平均亩产量为一百三十七斤，较大面积的丰产田有产六百多斤的，最高产量是一千四百四十一斤。
    谷子茎叶散发水量很少，调节力大，因此耐旱性很强。谷子的籽实（指带皮的）比其他粮食耐储藏。小米营养丰富，有特殊风味，北方许多地区把它列为粮食中的珍品。
    谷子秸秆（即谷草）养分也多于类似作物的秸秆，是一种价值较高的饲草。
