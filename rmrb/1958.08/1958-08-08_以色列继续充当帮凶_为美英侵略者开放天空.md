    Israel Continues to Act as an Accomplice
    Opening its Skies to American and British Aggressors
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 7th – The Israeli government has reopened its airspace to American and British aggressors.
    Following the Soviet government's warning on August 1st to the Israeli government about the dangerous consequences of allowing American and British military aircraft to pass through Israel for airlift operations, thereby becoming an accomplice to the American and British aggressors, the Israeli government announced on August 4th that it would prohibit American and British aircraft carrying military personnel and supplies from flying over Israel to Jordan. Since then, the United States and the United Kingdom have held frequent diplomatic talks with Israel.

    以色列继续充当帮凶
    为美英侵略者开放天空
    据新华社大马士革7日电  以色列政府已经重新为美英侵略者开放它的领空。
    在苏联政府8月1日警告以色列政府注意它允许美英军用飞机通过以色列进行空运，从而成为美英侵略者帮凶的危险后果以后，以色列政府曾在8月4日宣布禁止载运军事人员和给养的美国和英国飞机经过以色列上空飞往约旦。在这以后，美、英两国同以色列之间进行了频繁的外交会谈。
