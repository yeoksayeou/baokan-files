    Apples Bear Fruit Twice a Year
    In Xinlu Commune, Second Township, Third District, Hotan County, at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, there is a commune member’s home with five apple trees that bloom and bear fruit twice a year. The first fruit crop of these apple trees matured in mid-July this year. Then, in late July, they blossomed a second time, with pink flowers emitting fragrance. It is expected that they will mature at the end of September. The leaves of these five apple trees are still very green.

    In an agricultural cooperative in the Second Township, Second District of the county, peach trees have also been discovered that bloom and bear fruit twice a year. The second blossoming occurred in late August, and the peach trees are now full of flower buds.

    苹果一年结二次
    昆仑山下和阗县三区二乡新路社有一个社员家里的五棵苹果树，一年能开二次花，结二次果。今年苹果树第一次果实，在7月中旬成熟，接着在7月下旬又开了第二次花，粉红色的花朵吐出芳香。预计在9月底成熟，这五棵苹果树的树叶，现在还很嫩绿。
    该县二区二乡的一个农业社里，也发现桃树一年能开二次花，结二次果。第二次开花在8月下旬，现在桃树上已长满了花苞。
