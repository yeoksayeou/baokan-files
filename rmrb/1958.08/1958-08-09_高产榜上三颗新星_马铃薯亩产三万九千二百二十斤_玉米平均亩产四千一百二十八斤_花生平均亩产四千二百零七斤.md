Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th: Luo Guangcong, captain of the Seventh Team of the Third Cooperative of Xiacixiang Commune, Moudou District, Lichuan County, Hubei Province, and Qin Sanchun (female), Luo Zuli, and others cultivated a youth experimental plot with an area of 1.199 mu, which yielded a total of 47,025 jin of potatoes, averaging 39,220 jin per mu.

When digging up the potatoes, all fifty-odd laborers of the team were mobilized, and it took a whole day to finish digging. The potatoes dug from this field filled five rooms. The special and county inspection teams, as well as all the district and township party secretaries, totaling over 200 people, participated in the acceptance and on-site visit, proving the yield was accurate. The main reasons for the high yield were: deep plowing to eight inches, all planting of sprouted potatoes, applying 1,200 piculs of base fertilizer, weeding four times, top dressing three times, clearing ditches to drain waterlogging, and planting the local high-quality variety "Mi Yangyu," with an average of 450 jin of seeds used per mu. Its characteristic is that it bears many fruits, with a maximum of twenty-two fruits per plant, and most of them weigh four ounces each.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 8th: The Twenty-Fourth Cooperative of Lewuxiang Commune, Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, planted 23.1 mu of corn this year. After harvesting and threshing, a total of 95,374 jin of dry corn was harvested, averaging 4,128 jin per mu, with the highest yield per mu reaching 5,000 jin. Xu Wusheng, head of the Rural Work Department of the Wusheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Huang Yaoxian, secretary of the Central District Committee, and Jiang Yinzhou, secretary of the General Branch of this township, were present at the acceptance.

The main experiences of the large-scale corn bumper harvest in the Twenty-Fourth Cooperative are: (1) Deep plowing: the cornfield was dug for the first time about ten days before the Beginning of Winter, and the second time when sowing before the Spring Equinox, each time digging to a depth of one foot five inches. (2) Early planting and close planting: all sowing was completed before the Spring Equinox, one season earlier than in previous years. The seeds were "Golden Queen," "Horse Tooth," and "Seven Leaf." When sowing, efforts were made to ensure large and flat bottoms, a depth of eight inches, a row spacing of two feet, and a plant spacing of one foot. Each hole had two plants, with more than 7,000 holes and more than 14,000 plants per mu. (3) Heavy application of base fertilizer and three top dressings: 9,000 jin of night soil and 10,200 jin of compost were applied per mu; when the seedlings were five inches tall, 30,000 jin of "old wall mud" was heavily applied as fertilizer to promote seedling growth; when the seedlings were one foot five inches tall, 9,000 jin of human and animal manure was applied per mu as fertilizer to promote stem growth; when the corn first showed tassels, 9,000 jin of night soil and 200 jin of oil cake were applied per mu as fertilizer to promote ear growth. More than 60,000 jin of fertilizer were applied in total for the above four applications. In addition, the cooperative also paid attention to strengthening field management and did a good job in thinning seedlings, setting seedlings, cultivating, weeding, and preventing and controlling pests. The growing period was 105 days, and harvesting took place during Minor Heat.

Our newspaper reports: A peanut field of 1.44 mu in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, yielded a total of 6,058 jin of dry peanuts, averaging 4,207 jin per mu, creating the highest national record for peanut yield to date.

This high-yield peanut field was planted by the Seventh Team of the Third Squad of the Longxing Cooperative in Guihu Township, Jinjiang County. According to the peanuts already harvested from 19.1 mu of land, this team's average yield per mu reached 1,514 jin, an increase of 8.4 times compared to last year's yield of 160 jin per mu. The more than 6,000 jin of peanuts harvested from the high-yield 1.44 mu were weighed after being exposed to the scorching sun for six consecutive days. The township party secretary and more than 130 members of the cooperative participated in measuring the land and supervising the weighing and acceptance.

This plot of land has undergone a series of technical reforms such as deep plowing, close planting, and soil improvement, so that the Tongan variety, which used to have only two peanut kernels per pod, now has 60% or more with three to five kernels per pod, and one seed generally forms more than forty pods, with the most reaching more than one hundred and twenty. The masses call it the "Peanut King."

This bumper harvest has made people who previously thought that deep digging would leak fertilizer and close planting would result in fewer pods now say that deep plowing, close planting, and fertilizer are the three major magic weapons for increasing production. This bumper harvest was also achieved after overcoming droughts, typhoons, rainstorms, and floods. (Jinjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China Office)

    高产榜上三颗新星
    马铃薯亩产三万九千二百二十斤
    玉米平均亩产四千一百二十八斤
    花生平均亩产四千二百零七斤
    新华社武汉8日电  湖北利川县谋道区下磁乡三社七队队长罗光从和覃三春（女）、罗祖礼等三人搞的一块青年试验田，面积一亩一分九厘九，共收马铃薯四万七千零二十五斤，平均亩产三万九千二百二十斤。
    挖马铃薯的时候，全队五十多个劳动力全部出动，挖了一天的时间才挖完。从这块田里挖出来的马铃薯装满了五间屋。专、县验收组和全体区委、乡支书等二百余人参加了验收和现场参观，证明产量属实。获得丰产的主要原因是：深耕八寸，全部栽的芽子洋芋，施底肥一千二百挑，锄草四次，追肥三次，清沟排渍，种的是本地良种米洋芋，每亩平均用种四百五十斤。它的特点是结的果多，一蔸最多有二十二个果子，大部分是四两重一个。
    新华社成都8日电  四川省武胜县乐吾乡二十四社，今年种植的二十三点一亩玉米，收割脱粒后共收干玉米九万五千三百七十四斤，平均每亩产四千一百二十八斤，其中最高的一亩产量达五千斤。在场验收的有中共武胜县委农村工作部长许梧生、中心区委书记黄耀先和这个乡总支书记江银州等。
    二十四社玉米大面积丰产的主要经验是：（1）深耕，玉米地在立冬前十天左右挖头道，春分前播种时挖二道，每次挖一尺五寸深。（2）早栽、密植。春分前全部播种，比往年提前一个季节，种子是“金皇后”、“马牙齿”和“七匹叶”。播种时做到窝大底平、窝深八寸、行距二尺、窝距一尺。每窝二株，每亩七千多窝、一万四千多株。（3）重施底肥和三次追肥。每亩施水粪九千斤、堆肥一万零二百斤；苗高五寸时，重施攻苗肥三万斤“老墙泥”；苗高一尺五寸时，每亩施攻秆肥人畜粪九千斤；玉米初现顶花时，每亩施攻穗肥九千斤水粪和二百斤油饼。以上四次共施肥六万多斤。此外，这个社还注意加强田间管理、做好了匀苗、定苗、中耕、除草、防治虫害等工作，生长期共一百零五天，小暑收割。
    本报讯  福建省晋江县有一块一点四四亩大的花生地，共收干花生六千零五十八斤，平均亩产四千二百零七斤，创造了目前花生高产的全国最高纪录。
    这块花生高产地是该县龟湖乡龙星社第三中队第七小队种的。这个小队最近仅据已收的十九点一亩地的花生计算，平均亩产达一千五百一十四斤，比去年亩产一百六十斤增产了八点四倍。其中高产的一点四四亩所收的六千多斤花生，还是收下经过赤日炎天连晒六天之后才过秤的。乡党委书记和社一百三十多人参加了丈量土地和监秤验收。
    这丘地经过深耕、密植、改良土壤等一系列技术改革，使得向来一荚只有两粒花生仁的同安种，今年一荚中三到五粒的就占60％多，一粒种子一般结荚四十多，最多的一株达一百二十多。群众称之为“花生王”。
    这次丰收，使得以前认为深挖会漏肥、密植结荚会少的人，现在也说深耕密植肥料是增产三大法宝。这次丰产还是经过战胜旱灾台风暴雨洪水才得来的。（中共晋江县委办公室）
