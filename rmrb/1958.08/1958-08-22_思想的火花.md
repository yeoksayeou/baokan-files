　　Sparks of Thought
    Potential is Like a Well
    Potential is not like a cup of water, diminishing with each sip; it is a well, growing deeper with each dig, yielding more water. (Words from workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant)
    Profound Matters Can Be Measured
    The deeper you dig for potential, the higher the targets rise;
    Potential is bottomless, and targets know no limits;
    Profound matters can be measured; strive for the top. Jia Xi
    A Response to Shouting
    A university professor visited a laboratory and saw workers and students toiling together, even first-year students were doing research. The professor could no longer contain the fire in his heart, and he shouted: "If you write the data you've researched into a paper, I won't acknowledge it!"
    The workers and students replied: "What exists in the world will be the result of our labor, not the shout of 'I won't acknowledge it'." Jiang Shan
    Buttons and Buttonholes
    In the past, leading cadres participated in labor in factories for a set time. Now, whenever they have time, they labor together with the workers. An old worker said: "The branch secretary and the factory director are like buttons and buttonholes, inseparable."
                                                Zhai Xin
    Timely Summary of Experiences is Needed
    I was quite inspired after watching a basketball game. In less than five minutes, team A scored two consecutive goals. So team B called a "time-out" and held an emergency "on-site meeting," probably to sum up lessons learned. Sure enough, in less than five minutes, team B turned defeat into victory and scored three consecutive goals. Team A quickly called a time-out again to study countermeasures and catch up. During the less than one-hour game, both sides held such emergency meetings two or three times.
    An hour is insignificant compared to a month or a year, but the basketball players seized the time to hold two or three meetings, summarize experiences and lessons, take timely measures, and strive for the top, without feeling that there were "too many meetings."

    Literacy is Like Tiger Hunting
    I saw two middle-aged farmers in the village, one was a model in literacy, and the other was called "blindfolded" by the villagers, meaning: his eyes are covered, although he is not blind, he is a blind man with open eyes. Recently, I heard that this person has also become an activist in literacy. Here is a very meaningful dialogue:
    "Why didn't you learn to read and write in the past?"
    "I'm old, I get dizzy as soon as I learn, it's better not to learn."
    "How did you change?"
    "I had to change. In the past, when I saw black dots (characters), I was afraid, feeling that each one had a tiger's mouth, ready to bite my face. Later, after the party branch secretary mobilized me, I made up my mind to grab the tiger's mouth! It's strange to say, everyone was obedient and remembered everything clearly."
    Good: "Grab the tiger's mouth, everyone is obedient."
                                                Gao Liang

　　思想的火花
    潜力好比一口井
    潜力这东西不是一杯水，越喝越少；而是一口井，越挖越深，水也越多。  （上海机械工具厂工人的话）
    世事高深可测
    潜力挖得越深，指标长得越高；
    潜力挖不到底，指标长不到头；
    世事高深可测；只要力争上游。  贾晞
    对吼声的回答
    一位大学教授到实验室去，看到工人和学生们一起苦干苦钻，连一年级的学生也在作研究工作。这位教授再也按捺不住心头之火了，他大声说：“如果把你们研究出来的数据写进论文里去，我不承认！”
    工人和学生回答说：在世界上存在的，将是我们劳动的成果，而不是“你不承认”的吼声。  江山
    钮扣和钮眼
    领导干部下工厂参加劳动，过去规定时间，现在只要一有时间，就跟工人一起劳动。老工人说：“支部书记、厂长和我们就像钮扣和钮眼，再也拆不散了。”

    要及时总结经验
    看了一场篮球赛受了不小启发。不到五分钟，甲队接连投中两个球。于是乙队叫“停”，开了个紧急“现场会”，大概是总结教训吧。果然，又不到五分钟，乙队便转败为胜，接连投中三个球。甲队又赶快叫停，研究对策，又赶了过去。不到一个钟头的比赛中，双方都召开了两三次这样的紧急会议。
    一个钟头与一月一年的时间比起来是微不足道的，但篮球运动员们却抓紧时间召开了两三次会议，总结经验教训，及时采取措施，力争上游，并没有“会议过多”的感觉。

    识字如打虎
    我在村里见到两个中年农民，一个是扫盲模范，一个被村里人叫作“蒙眼”，意思是：眼睛蒙上布了，虽然眼没瞎，却是个睁眼瞎子。最近，听说这个人也成了扫盲积极分子，下面是一段很有意义的对话：
    “过去怎么不学文化呢？”
    “年岁大了，一学就发晕，还不如不学。”
    “怎么变过来的呢？”
    “叫它变就得变过来，过去看见黑点子（字），就发怕，觉着个个张着虎嘴，要咬自己的脸，后来党支书一动员，我心一横，非把虎嘴抓住！说也怪，个个都服贴了，记得一清二楚。”
    好啊：“把虎嘴抓住，个个都服贴了。”
