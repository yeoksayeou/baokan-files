Sisters-in-law Praising Carts
Jie Xianglin

In the Zhou family courtyard live two sisters-in-law,
The elder sister-in-law is twenty, the younger eighteen,
Having heard the General Line that day,
They worked overnight to achieve cart-ization.
The two sisters-in-law learned carpentry,
Each making a cart,
The younger sister made a "rooster cart",
The elder sister made a three-wheeled "card".
The younger sister said, "I can walk on field ridges,"
The elder sister said, "I can climb slopes."
The younger sister said, "I can deliver a thousand loads of fertilizer,"
The elder sister said, "I can push ten thousand catties of grain."
The younger sister said, "I can chase the sun,"
"The sun always shines behind me."
The elder sister said, "I'm faster than the wind,"
"For every trip the wind makes, I make several."
The younger sister said, "If there's a road to heaven,"
"I'll push my cart to meet the Seventh Fairy,"
"The Jade Emperor will be angry and glare,"
"The heavenly soldiers and generals can't catch up,"
"We'll bring her to our cooperative,"
"And assign her to manage the club."
The elder sister said, "If there's a road to heaven,"
"I'll push my cart to meet the Queen Mother of the West,"
"And ask her to set up a toddler group,"
"To act as nannies for the members,"
"Sending the children early and picking them up late,"
"So I can work well during the day."
The two sisters-in-law praised their carts,
Alarming the sun to come and observe,
Hearing a burst of thunder,
The carts flew out of the big courtyard.

    姑嫂夸车
    揭祥麟
    周家院子两姑嫂，
    嫂嫂二十妹十八，
    当天听过总路线，
    连夜就搞车子化。
    姑嫂二人学木匠，
    车子一个造一架，
    妹妹做的鸡公车，
    嫂嫂做的三轮卡。
    妹说田坎我能走，
    嫂说坡坡我能上。
    妹说我送千担肥，
    嫂说我推万斤粮。
    妹说我能撵太阳，
    太阳总在我后头亮。
    嫂说我比风快当，
    风跑一回我跑几趟。
    妹说若有上天路，
    推车去接七仙姑，
    玉皇气得干瞪眼，
    天兵天将追不住，
    接到我们合作社，
    派她去管俱乐部。
    嫂说若有上天路，
    推车去会西王母，
    要她办个娃娃组，
    代替社员当保姆，
    早送娃娃晚接回，
    白天我好把工做。
    姑嫂二人把车夸，
    惊醒太阳来观察，
    耳听一阵雷声响，
    车子飞出大院坝。
