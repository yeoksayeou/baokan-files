    The Type 20 steel rope percussion drilling machine produced by Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory can drill tube wells 300 meters deep and half a meter in diameter, which is very suitable for rural well drilling. However, because the engine on the drilling machine is an electric motor, most rural areas do not yet have power, and after buying it, they have to modify it to use a diesel engine or other internal combustion engine for transmission, and also add many parts. This not only delays the use time, but also costs an extra four to five thousand yuan, which is very uneconomical. Therefore, in addition to manufacturing electric drilling machines, it is suggested that some drilling machines driven by internal combustion engines should also be produced according to the current actual situation in rural areas to meet the needs.

    应该生产内燃钻机
    太原矿山机械厂生产的20型钢绳冲击式钻机，能打三百公尺深半公尺口径的管井，很适合农村打井用。但是，因为钻机上的发动机是一个电动机，目前大多数农村还没有电源，买回去后只好改装用柴油机或别的内燃机传动，同时还要添换很多零件。这样，既拖延使用时间，又要多花四、五千元，很不经济。因此，建议除了制造电动的钻机外，还应该根据目前农村的实际情况，生产一些用内燃机带动的钻机，以便满足需要。
