　　Thousand-Year Wish Comes True
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Yangshen
　　When people talk about famous corn varieties such as "Golden Queen" and "Da Huang Zao", they can't help but be attracted by the plump, multi-grained corn cobs. However, every time at harvest, farmers painfully discover that out of every hundred corn stalks, generally five or even ten are barren; even if they do produce a cob, the vast majority only produce one.
　　For thousands of years, people have been fantasizing: Can we make barren corn stalks that don't produce cobs bear cobs, and make those that produce few cobs produce more? The young peasant scientific researchers of Shanba Agricultural Cooperative in Dafang County, Guizhou Province, under the leadership and support of the Party, created an artificial assisted corn cultivation method of inserting bamboo sticks to eliminate barren corn stalks, turning this wish into reality.
　　Shanba Cooperative is located at the highest part of the Guizhou Plateau, at an altitude of two thousand meters. Before liberation, this was a barren land where no crops grew at all, and people lived by digging coal and carrying *zhanba*. It was not until the spring of 1953 that the peasants, under the leadership of the Party, planted the first batch of crops in the township – twelve mu of corn, and gained the first bumper harvest in the autumn. Since then, crops such as rice and potatoes have gradually taken root and blossomed in the mountainous area, and grain output has increased year by year, reaching a total output of 2.36 million *jin* in 1956, with an average yield of 398 *jin* per mu.
　　This year, the cooperative members put forward the bold plan of producing a double thousand *jin* per mu, striving for three thousand *jin*. In order to realize this plan, the question of "how to make barren corn stalks bear cobs, and make those that produce few cobs produce more?" became the focus of discussion among the cooperative members. To this end, the Party branch made a decision to eliminate barren stalks and designated the township head Yu Shigao to be responsible for leading this scientific research work.
　　At a Zhuge Liang meeting chaired by Zhang Ping, the secretary of the CCP township branch, Yu Shigao and young scientific researchers Xiao Yangxing, Gou Dawen, Sun Guoxiang, and others talked about how local farmers, on New Year's Eve, would cut a notch in unproductive walnut trees with a knife and feed them with pork and rice; the following year, the trees would bear more and sweeter fruits. The suggestion of this familiar method immediately aroused everyone's interest. Some believed that it was mainly the nutrients from the meat and rice that were absorbed by the tree; but more people believed that it was because the tree was cut or some skin was peeled off, and was stimulated, so that the nutrients that were previously only used for growing the trunk could now be used for bearing fruit. At this time, they associated and compared the problems of fruit trees and corn, and based on their five years of experience in planting corn, they observed that barren corn stalks were very thick and round, red in color, and tasted as sweet as sugarcane; while the corn stalks that produced cobs were flat and round, and not sweet. Why was this so? Everyone came to the conclusion that the nutrients and water of the corn were all concentrated in the stalks and were not transported to the tassels and corn cobs, so it was necessary to find a way to get the nutrients to the corn cobs.
　　How to stimulate the corn to make it produce more cobs? People put forward various opinions. Some advocated cutting with a knife, some suggested piercing with a needle, and others suggested simply removing the tassels of the corn, just like topping tobacco. After repeated research, it was considered that the method of inserting bamboo sticks was the simplest and easiest to implement. Because cutting with a knife could easily break the entire corn stalk; as for removing the tassels, no cobs would grow at all. Subsequently, research was conducted on what kind of sticks to use, whether to insert them horizontally or obliquely, where to insert them, and when to insert them. After careful planning, on July 20, an experiment was started on a piece of barren land with an area of 1.14 mu. At that time, most of the more than two thousand corn stalks on this land only produced one cob, and 5% were barren. After inserting the sticks and nearly a month of growth, the results of the inspection on August 14 showed that the barren stalks had been eliminated, and the highest number of cobs was nine. Among the 2,330 corn stalks, a total of 9,015 cobs of various sizes were produced, with an average of nearly four cobs per stalk, and it was estimated that 2,034 *jin* of corn could be harvested per mu. In the other 1,210 mu (accounting for 38% of the total corn area) of cornfields in the cooperative that had been stuck with bamboo sticks, the barren stalks were basically eliminated, and generally three or four cobs were produced. It can be said with certainty that people now have the power to control the number of corn cobs.
　　In order to make the newly grown corn cobs plump after inserting the sticks, the members of the Shanba Cooperative Science Station are stepping up the late-stage field management of the corn. At present, although the weather is cold and windy in the Shanba Cooperative area, the cooperative members are still overcoming all difficulties to weed, artificially pollinate, and topdress the corn.

　　千年愿望变现实
　　新华社记者　刘扬深
    当人们一谈到“金皇后”、“大黄早”等等著名的玉米品种时，总不禁被那肥硕多粒的玉米棒所吸引。可是每当收获时，农民们会痛心地发现，每一百根玉米秆中，一般都有五根、甚至十根左右是不结果的；即使结上玉米棒，绝大多数也只有一个。
    千万年来，人们在幻想：能不能叫不结包的玉米空秆结上包，叫少结包的多结包呢？贵州省大方县山坝农业社的青年农民科学研究员们，在党的领导和支持下，创造出插竹签消灭玉米空秆的人工辅助玉米生育法，就把这种愿望变成了现实。
    山坝社处在贵州高原的顶高部，海拔二千公尺。解放前，这里是一片不毛之地，根本不长庄稼，人们靠挖煤、背栈巴过活。直到1953年春天，农民们才在党的领导下，种下全乡第一批庄稼——十二亩玉米，秋天获得第一次丰收。从此以后，水稻、洋芋等作物逐渐在山区生根开花，粮食产量逐年增加，1956年全乡总产量达到二百三十六万斤，平均亩产三百九十八斤。
    今年，社员们提出亩产双千斤，争取三千斤的豪迈规划。为了实现这一计划，“怎样叫玉米空秆结上包、少结包的多结包？”这个问题就成为社员谈论的中心。为此，党支部作出消灭空秆的决定，并指定乡长喻士国负责领导这项科学研究工作。
    在一次由中共乡支部书记张平主持的诸葛亮会上，喻士国和青年科学研究员萧养兴、苟大文、孙国相等几个人，谈起当地农民对不结果实的核桃树，在大年三十晚上，用刀往树上砍一个缺口，喂以猪肉和米饭，第二年树上结的果子便又多又甜。这个熟悉的问题一提出，立即引起大家的兴趣。有人认为主要是肉和饭的养料被树吸收了；但更多的人认为是由于树被砍伤或剥去一些皮后，受到刺激，使过去只用在长树干的养分，现在能用在结果实上。这时，他们把果树和玉米的问题一联想、对比，根据五年来种玉米的体验，观察到凡是空秆的玉米秆都很粗圆，颜色发红，秆子吃起来像甘蔗一样甜；而结包的玉米秆却是扁圆的，又不甜。为什么会这样呢？大家得出这样的结论：由于玉米的养料、水分全集中在秆子上，而没有输送到天花和玉米包上，因此必须想办法使养分送到玉米包上。
    怎样去刺激玉米，让它多结包呢？人们又提出各种意见。有的主张用刀割，有的建议用针刺，也有人提出干脆像烤烟去尖一样，把玉米的天花摘掉。经过反复研究，认为插竹签的办法最简便易行。因为用刀割很容易使整个玉米秆弄断；至于把天花摘掉，那就根本长不出包。随后对使用什么签子，是平插还是斜插，插在那个部位，什么时间插等等，都作了研究。经过缜密的计划后，7月20日开始，就在一块面积一点一四亩的瘦地上进行试验。当时这块地上的两千多根玉米秆，绝大部分只结一个包，而且有5％的空秆。插签后，经过近一个月的生长，8月14日逐株检查结果，空秆已经消灭，最高的结包九个。在二千三百三十株玉米中，共结大小包九千零十五个，平均每株结包近四个，预计每亩可收玉米二千零三十四斤。全社其他一千二百一十亩（占玉米面积总数38％），用竹签插过的玉米地中，也基本消灭了空秆，一般结包三、四个。可以肯定地说，人们现在完全有力量控制玉米结包的数目了。
    为了使插签后新长出的玉米包长得饱满，山坝社科学站的成员们正在加紧玉米后期田间管理。目前，山坝社这一地区虽然天冷风大，社员们仍是排除万难为玉米锄草、人工授粉和追肥。
