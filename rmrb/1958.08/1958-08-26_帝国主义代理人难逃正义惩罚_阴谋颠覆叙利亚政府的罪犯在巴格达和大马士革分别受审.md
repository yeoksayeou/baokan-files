Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 25th: Former Iraqi Deputy Chief of Staff, Daqistani, testified in an Iraqi military court on the 24th that the American and British governments had helped conspirators attempt to overthrow the Syrian government. The Iraqi military court is currently hearing the major conspiracy case of 1957 to subvert the Syrian government.

Defendant Daqistani testified that the former Iraqi Faisal dynasty's Crown Prince Ira and Prime Minister Said had decided to overthrow the Syrian government, believing that this could not be done without the intervention of the Iraqi army. Daqistani was then designated to be responsible for this task.

He confessed that he received a plan called "X" from his predecessor, Major General Amin. This plan included intelligence about the Syrian army. The Said government also sent him to Switzerland to meet with Syrian fascists and former President Shishakli. Shishakli told him about his plan to launch a coup in Syria and requested financial assistance from the Said government. The Said government then sent 30,000 dinars to Shishakli.

The defendant continued, saying that exiled Syrians began to operate and contacted the Said government to cooperate in executing the plan to launch a coup in Syria. The conspirators demanded that the Said government supply 20,000 weapons and 1 million dinars, as well as organize training camps and send the army to assist them. The Said government gave them 120,000 dinars and requested assistance from the American and British governments. These two governments said that they had already provided assistance to the conspirators. All parties agreed to coordinate the plans of all parties through the Said government.

Half of the weapons needed for this conspiracy were sent from the United States, and the other half were purchased from Italy. The implementation of the plan was interrupted by the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. Five months after the invasion, Said contacted the defendant and told him about a new plan to launch a coup in Syria.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 24th: The Damascus military court has begun hearing the cases of former Syrian Prime Minister Hussein al-Barazi, former parliamentarian Fazat Mamluk, and journalist Hassan Abdul Ali. This trial is being held in absentia because the defendants are abroad. The three defendants are accused of betraying their country and plotting an anti-Syrian conspiracy under the leadership of former Iraqi dictator Said.

The Attorney General has requested the death penalty for the three defendants.

　　帝国主义代理人难逃正义惩罚
    阴谋颠覆叙利亚政府的罪犯在巴格达和大马士革分别受审
    新华社巴格达25日电　前伊拉克陆军副参谋长达吉斯塔尼24日在伊拉克军事法庭上供称，美英政府曾经帮助阴谋分子企图推翻叙利亚政府。伊拉克军事法庭正在审讯1957年企图颠覆叙利亚政府的大阴谋案。
    被告达吉斯塔尼供称，前伊拉克费萨尔王朝的王储伊拉和首相赛义德曾经决定推翻叙利亚政府，他们认为，没有伊拉克军队进行干涉就不能做到这一点。达吉斯塔尼就被指定来负责进行这项工作。
    他供认，他从他的前任者阿明少将那里得到一份叫作“X”的计划。这份计划中包括了有关叙利亚军队的情报。赛义德政府还派他到瑞士去同叙利亚法西斯分子、前总统施舍克里会谈。施舍克里把他准备在叙利亚发动政变的计划告诉他，并且要求赛义德政府给予财政上的帮助。赛义德政府就把三万第纳尔寄给了施舍克里。
    被告接着说，流亡的叙利亚人开始活动，并且同赛义德政府接触，以配合执行在叙利亚发动政变的计划。阴谋分子要求赛义德政府供应两万件武器和一百万第纳尔，并且举办训练营和派陆军去援助他们。赛义德政府给了他们十二万第纳尔，并且要求美国和英国政府给予援助。这两国政府说，它们已经给予阴谋分子以援助。几方面都同意通过赛义德政府来把各方面的计划加以协调。
    这项阴谋所需要的武器有一半是从美国送来的，另一半是从意大利购买的。实行计划的活动因为英法侵略埃及的事件发生而中断。侵略事件发生以后五个月，赛义德同被告接触，并且把一项在叙利亚发动政变的新计划告诉他。
    新华社大马士革24日电　大马士革的军事法庭开始审理前叙利亚总理侯赛尼·巴拉齐、前议员法扎特·马姆卢克和记者哈桑·阿卜杜勒·阿里的案件。这次审判是缺席审判，因为被告在国外。三个被告被控背叛祖国，并且在前伊拉克独裁者赛义德的领导下策划反叙利亚的阴谋。
    检察长要求对这三个被告判处死刑。（附图片）
