Wheat Can Still Greatly Increase Production
Dīng Shān

This year's total winter wheat production reached 68.9 billion catties, an increase of 68% compared to last year. Furthermore, "satellites" with yields of over 7,000 catties per mu were launched, breaking the world record for high wheat yields. This is a remarkable achievement, encouraging people to advance victoriously and continue to strive for even greater harvests of rice, corn, millet, and other crops. However, can wheat continue to increase production significantly next year? People are very concerned about this question.

The news report "From High Yield to Higher Yield" published in today's newspaper provides many materials for studying this issue. Shenwan Township in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, is a thousand-catty township for wheat this year, with an average yield three times higher than last year (last year's yield was 247 catties per mu). However, the cadres and masses of this township believe that there were still many loopholes in last year's wheat planting. If the experience of high-yield fields is universally promoted, wheat can not only increase production next year, but also increase production significantly. Therefore, they decided to increase wheat yield per mu from 1,000 catties to 2,000 catties, and have formulated specific measures to achieve this goal.

This incident once again tells us that without ideological leaps, there can be no leaps in production. The key to whether wheat can continue to increase production significantly lies in whether people dare to let it leap forward and are willing to work hard to cultivate it for high yield. The people of Shenwan Township are doing the right thing. They are not intoxicated by this year's production achievements, but correctly recognize and exert people's subjective initiative, determined to move from high yield to higher yield, so that nature can better benefit mankind.

At the same time, we also found that after the summer harvest, new right-leaning conservative ideas began to emerge in some places. Some people are complacent and very satisfied with this year's wheat harvest; others believe that "the land's fertility has been exhausted, and it will be difficult to increase wheat production next year." This is a very dangerous idea. If the masses, especially leading cadres, in some units or regions have this idea, then next year's wheat production in this region or unit will inevitably be seriously affected.

We should certainly be happy about the unprecedented high-speed growth achieved by wheat this year, and we should be very happy, but there must be no complacency whatsoever. Complacency will hinder our continued progress; moreover, how can the achievements already made satisfy us? If you don't believe it, look at the facts! Although the total wheat production this year increased by 68% compared to last year, the average yield per mu was only 183 catties. Doesn't that seem too low? Furthermore, although there are high-yield counties with yields of 400, 500, and 600 catties per mu across the country, there are also low-yield counties with an average yield of 25 catties per mu! How can we be complacent about this? Also, the high-yield record of 7,000 catties per mu seems earth-shattering and inspiring today, but what is it to the ideologically liberated Chinese farmers? Aren't they now preparing to launch even larger "satellites" with wheat yields of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000... per mu!

It is not true that the land's fertility has been exhausted this year. The extremely uneven phenomenon of wheat production increase this year indicates that there is still great potential for increasing production. Many people believe that this year's wheat is "heavy at the top, light at the bottom, with shallow roots." This means that the deep plowing, base fertilizer, and dense planting were not up to requirements when planting wheat last year, and the large harvest was achieved by strengthening field management. If we can overcome these shortcomings this year, and turn all low-yield fields into high-yield fields, and low-yield counties into high-yield counties, then the total wheat production of the country will not be more than 60 billion catties, but a much larger figure.

Perhaps some people will say that low-yield areas do indeed have great potential for increasing production, but the land's fertility in high-yield areas has been exhausted, and it is difficult to increase production. This is also not true. The fact that the farmers of Shenwan Township dare to increase wheat yield per mu from 1,000 catties to 2,000 catties is a strong answer. If you think that the scope of a commune is too small, then look at the situation in high-yield counties! The average wheat yield per mu in Yanshi County, Henan Province, was 571 catties this year. From the production level this year, this cannot be considered low. According to the county party secretary's research, if the wheat land is deeply plowed more than one foot this year, the amount of seeds sown per mu is increased to 25 catties, and 30,000 catties of base fertilizer are applied, there is definitely confidence that wheat production will double next year.

This estimate is completely reasonable. Because the level of agricultural production depends on people's production experience and farming technology, and people's production experience and farming technology come from practice and are constantly developing in practice; as production experience and farming technology improve, the level of production will inevitably continue to improve. This year, we have the experience of cultivating small-area high yields of 7,000 catties per mu of wheat, the experience of large-area high yields of more than 600 catties per mu in the whole county, and the experience of a 68% increase in total national production. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that wheat production will definitely continue to increase significantly next year, and will definitely create a new record for higher yields per mu!

### 小麦还能大增产

    小麦还能大增产
    丁山
    今年冬小麦总产量达到六百八十九亿斤，比去年增长68％，并且放出了亩产七千多斤的大“卫星”，刷新了世界小麦高额丰产纪录。这是一件了不起的大事，它鼓舞着人们乘胜前进，继续争取水稻、玉米、谷子等各种农作物更大的丰收。但是，小麦明年还能不能继续大幅度增产？人们对这个问题非常关心。
    今天本报发表的通讯“从高产走向更高产”，对研究这个问题提供了不少材料。湖北谷城县沈湾乡今年是小麦千斤乡，平均产量比去年增加三倍（去年亩产二百四十七斤）。但是这个乡的干部和群众认为，去年种麦工作中的漏洞还很多，要是把高额丰产田的经验普遍推行开，明年小麦不仅能够增产，而且能够大大增产。于是他们决定要把小麦亩产量由一千斤提到二千斤，并且已经制定了实现这个指标的具体措施。
    这件事再次告诉我们，没有思想上的跃进，就不可能有生产上的跃进。小麦能不能继续大幅度增产的关键，就在于人们敢不敢让它跃进，肯不肯下苦工去培育它高产。沈湾乡的人民做得对，他们没有被今年的增产成绩所陶醉，而是正确地认识并且发挥了人的主观能动作用，决心从高产走向更高产，让大自然更好地为人类造福。
    同时我们也发现，在夏季大丰收以后，新的右倾保守思想在有些地方又开始产生了。有人对今年小麦大丰收表现出沾沾自喜，十分满足；有人认为“地力已经用尽了，明年小麦增产有困难。”这是十分危险的思想，如果某些单位或地区的群众、特别是领导干部有了这种思想，那么这个地区或单位的明年小麦生产必然会受到严重的影响。
    我们对于今年小麦所创造出来的史无前例的高速度增长的成绩，当然应该高兴，而且应该大大高兴，但是这绝不能有丝毫自满。自满就会阻碍我们继续前进；何况已经取得的这些成绩又怎能让我们满足呢？不信，请看事实吧！今年小麦总产量虽然比去年增加68％，可是平均亩产量不过一百八十三斤，这难道能不嫌它太低吗？再说，全国虽然出现了亩产四百斤、五百斤、六百斤的高产县，可是也还有平均亩产二十五斤的低产县啊！这又怎能沾沾自喜呢？还有，亩产七千斤的高额丰产纪录，在今天看来确实惊天动地，振奋人心，可是对于思想解放了的中国农民来说这又算得了什么呢？他们现在不是正在准备放射小麦亩产一万、一万五、二万……的更大型的“卫星”吗！
    说今年地力已经用尽了，这不是事实。今年小麦增产极不平衡的现象，就表明增产潜力还很大。许多人都认为今年小麦是“头重，脚轻，根底浅”。这意思是说，去年种麦时深耕、底肥和密植都不够要求，大丰收是靠加强田间管理得来的。如果我们今年能克服这些缺点，使所有的低产田变成高产田，低产县变成高产县，那么全国小麦的总产量就不是六百多亿斤，而是比它大得多的数字了。
    也许还有人说，低产地区增产潜力的确很大，高产地区地力用尽了，增产有困难。这也不是事实。沈湾乡的农民敢把小麦亩产量由一千斤提到二千斤，就是一个有力的回答。如果认为一个社的范围太小，那就请看高产县的情况吧！河南偃师县今年小麦平均亩产五百七十一斤，从今年的生产水平来看，这不能算低。据这个县的县委书记研究，如果今年麦地深翻一尺以上，每亩播种量增加到二十五斤，底肥三万斤，明年小麦产量翻一番肯定有把握。
    这个估计完全有道理。因为农作物生产水平的高或低，决定于人们的生产经验和耕作技术水平，而人们的生产经验和耕作技术来自实践，并且在实践中不断发展；随着生产经验和耕作技术的提高，生产水平必然不断提高。今年，我们有了培育小麦亩产七千斤的小面积丰产经验，有了全县平均亩产六百斤以上的大面积丰产经验，有了全国总产量增长68％的经验，因此，可以肯定地说，明年小麦生产一定能够继续大幅度增长，一定能够创造出更高的亩产新纪录！
