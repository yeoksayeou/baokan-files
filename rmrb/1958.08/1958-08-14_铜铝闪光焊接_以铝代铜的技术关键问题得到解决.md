　　Copper-Aluminum Flash Butt Welding
　　Key Technical Problem of Aluminum Substitution for Copper Solved
    One of the important technical problems in China's power construction—the welding of "aluminum-copper transition joints"—has recently been successfully trial-produced through the cooperation of the Electric Power Construction Science and Technology Research Institute and the Welding Teaching and Research Section of Tianjin University. After testing, the quality has reached the international advanced level.
    The electric power industry is the dynamic foundation of all industries. In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, many power stations will be built throughout China, each of which requires a large number of copper-aluminum transition joints. The conductive parts of electrical equipment currently produced in China are still made of copper. Therefore, to implement the state's policy of substituting aluminum for copper and widely adopt aluminum conductors, the welding problem of aluminum-copper joints must first be solved.
    Due to the different thermophysical and mechanical properties of aluminum and copper, good bonding and necessary electrical and mechanical properties cannot be obtained by ordinary arc welding or other methods. After studying the general line, the Electric Power Construction Science and Technology Research Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Welding Teaching and Research Section of Tianjin University went all out, overcame many technical difficulties, modified the equipment, and used the world's most advanced flash butt welding technology based on Soviet experience, and successfully trial-produced aluminum-copper transition joints in China for the first time. This welding method can not only weld rectangular aluminum-copper joints, but also solve various forms of aluminum-copper transition joints with a cross-sectional area of less than 1,000 square millimeters, creating the necessary conditions for the power industry to implement the country's policy of substituting aluminum for copper.
    After testing cold bending, tensile strength, metallography, corrosion, and electrical performance, it was proven that the quality has reached the international advanced level. (Attached picture)

　　铜铝闪光焊接
　　以铝代铜的技术关键问题得到解决
    我国电力建设中的重要技术问题之一——“铝铜过渡接头”的焊接最近已由电力建设科学技术研究所和天津大学焊接教研室合作试制成功了。经过试验，质量达到了国际先进水平。
    电力工业是各种工业的动力基础。在工农业生产大跃进中，我国各地将建设起许多电站，每个电站都需要大量的铜、铝过渡接头，我国目前生产的电气设备的导电部分还都是用铜做成的，因此要贯彻国家以铝代铜的政策，大量采用铝导线，必须首先解决铝铜接头的焊接问题。
    由于铝铜两种材料具有不同的热物理特性及机械特性，所以用普通的电弧焊或其他方法得不到良好的结合及必要的电气、机械性能。水利电力部电力建设科学技术研究所和天津大学焊接教研室在学习总路线后，鼓足了干劲，克服了许多技术上的困难，将设备进行了改装，根据苏联经验采用世界上最先进的闪光焊接技术，第一次在我国试制成功了铝铜过渡接头。用这种焊接方法不仅能够焊接矩形断面的铝铜接头，而且能够解决截面积在一千平方公厘以下的各种形式的铝铜过渡接头，给电力工业贯彻国家的以铝代铜技术政策创造了必要的条件。
    经过冷弯、拉力强度、金相，腐蚀及电气性能的鉴定，证明质量已经达到了国际先进水平。（附图片）
