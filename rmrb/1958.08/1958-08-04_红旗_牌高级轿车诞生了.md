    The "Red Flag" Brand Luxury Sedan is Born
    Our country's first luxury sedan was born on August 1st at the First Automobile Works. At the naming ceremony held on the 2nd, it was officially named the "Red Flag" brand sedan.
    Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, cut the ribbon and spoke at the naming ceremony. He expressed warm congratulations to the workers of the First Automobile Works for producing the luxury sedan.
    The birth of the "Red Flag" brand luxury sedan demonstrates that our country's young automobile manufacturing industry is leaping forward technologically at a rapid pace. This car uses many advanced technologies of the modern automobile industry. It is equipped with a new "V"-type eight-cylinder overhead valve engine, which has better performance and greater horsepower than ordinary in-line engines. Its maximum power is 200 horsepower, and its maximum speed can reach 4,400 revolutions per minute. It can run at a maximum speed of 185 kilometers per hour. The transmission device is a new type of hydraulic automatic transmission, integrated with the engine; the driver can automatically shift gears by stepping on the accelerator, controlling the driving speed. The steering device is a new device that uses hydraulic power to control the steering; the driver only needs to turn it lightly to accurately and flexibly change the driving direction.
    The "Red Flag" sedan has a total of six seats (including the driver's seat), and the passenger compartment is spacious and comfortable. The car also has heating and cooling devices. The front and rear windows are fitted with single-piece curved glass. The car doors and window glass are automatically opened, closed, and raised electrically. It has an automatic wireless radio. The front seat can automatically move up, down, forward, and backward according to the driver's body characteristics. The car also has good shockproof, soundproof, and heat insulation devices.
    The decoration of this luxury sedan is also quite exquisite. The car body is painted all black, the tone is dignified, and the design is generous and beautiful. A red flag made of plexiglass is inserted in the center of the front of the car. The dashboard in the driver's compartment is specially made of domestic fragrant red wood. The interior is carpeted with domestic carpets.
    After the First Automobile Works produced the "East Wind" brand sedan, it immediately put forward the new leap forward slogan of "Riding the East Wind, displaying the Red Flag, and making a luxury sedan to see Chairman Mao." This luxury sedan was designed in only one month, and while designing, it formulated the process and produced it at the same time, greatly accelerating the design and trial production progress. In recent days, when the trial production of this car entered the final stage, the factory director, party committee secretary, workers, and technicians worked together, sleeplessly and continuously fighting for several nights.
    The trial production of this car also received assistance from sixty-one brother units in eleven cities.

    “红旗”牌高级轿车诞生了
    我国第一辆高级轿车8月1日在第一汽车制造厂诞生。在2日举行的命名仪式大会上，正式命名为“红旗”牌轿车。
    中共吉林省委第一书记吴德在命名仪式的大会上剪彩并讲话。他对第一汽车厂工人制成高级轿车表示热烈祝贺。
    “红旗”牌高级轿车的诞生，表明我国年轻的汽车制造工业在技术上正以飞快的速度向前跃进。这辆轿车采用了许多现代汽车工业的先进技术。车上装有新式“V”型八缸顶置式的发动机，比一般直列式发动机性能好，马力大。它的最大功率是二百马力，每分钟最高转速可达四千四百转。每小时最快能跑一百八十五公里。变速装置是一种新式的液压力自动变速箱，和发动机连成一个整体；司机脚踏油门就可以自动换挡，掌握行驶速度。转向装置是一种借助于液压动力控制转向的新装置，只消司机轻轻地转动它，就会准确、灵活地转换行驶方向。
    “红旗”轿车共有六个座位（包括司机座位在内），车厢宽敞，乘用舒适。车上并有暖风、冷气发生装置。前后车窗安装着整块曲面玻璃。车门和门窗玻璃采用电气自动开闭、升降。带有自动无线的收音机。前座可根据司机身体特点自动地向上下前后移动。车上还有良好的防震、隔音和绝热装置。
    这部高级轿车的装饰也相当考究。车身全黑喷漆，色调庄重，车型大方、美观。一面用有机玻璃制成的红旗插在车头中央。驾驶室仪表盘是用国产香红木特制的。车内铺设国产地毯。
    第一汽车制造厂制成“东风”牌轿车后，紧接着提出“乘东风，展红旗，制成高级轿车去见毛主席”的新的跃进口号。这辆高级轿车只用一个月的时间就设计好，并一边设计，一边制订工艺，一边生产，大大加快了设计、试制进度。最近几天，当这辆汽车的试制进入最后阶段时，厂长、党委书记和工人、技术人员一道，彻夜不眠，连续苦战了几个通宵。
    这部汽车的试制，还得到十一个城市的六十一个兄弟单位的援助。
