A hydroelectric hub project in Jiangxi Province with a generating capacity of 300,000 kilowatts has started construction ahead of schedule due to the adoption of the method of simultaneous exploration, design, and construction.

　　This hydroelectric hub project is located in Wan'an County in the middle reaches of the Gan River. Its components include a power plant, a spillway dam, a ship lock, and irrigation canals. After completion, it will not only meet the electricity needs of the Jiangxi iron mining area, the Ji'an area, and parts of southern Jiangxi, but will also eliminate the frequent flood disasters in the Hetai Basin, the Ganfu Plain, and Nanchang City.

　　赣江中游建电站
    江西省一座发电能力为三十万瓩的水力发电枢纽工程，由于采取边勘探、边设计、边施工的方法，已经提前开工兴建。
    这座水力发电枢纽工程位于赣江中游的万安县，它的组成部分有电厂、溢洪坝、船闸和灌溉渠道等。建成以后不仅可以满足江西铁矿区、吉安地区和赣南部分地区对电力的需要，同时也将消除合泰盆地、赣抚平原和南昌市经常遭受的洪水灾害。
