    A Eulogy to the People's Vigilance
    I liked the column "Casting a Net of Justice, Enemies Cannot Escape" on the fifth page of the July 17th edition. The four short reports in the column depicted the people's love for the new society and their hatred for the enemy, and eulogized the revolutionary vigilance of the people. It also shows that no matter what work is done, as long as we rely on the strength of the broad masses of the people, we can achieve unexpected results. The example of "an eight-year unsolved case, solved in a day" is a good proof. From these reports, it can be seen that the vigilance of the masses and the strength of the masses are the most reliable guarantee for public security work.

    对人民警惕性的歌颂
    我喜欢7月17日第五版“撒下天罗地网，敌人插翅难逃”这个专栏。专栏里的四篇短小的报道，写出了人民群众对新社会的热爱、对敌人的憎恨，歌颂了人民的革命警惕性。同时也说明了，无论做什么工作，只要依靠广大人民群众力量，就能够获得意想不到的成效。“八年无头公案，一日水落石出”的事例，就是很好的证明。从这些报道中可以看出，群众的警惕性和群众的力量是治安工作最可靠的保证。
