Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th (TASS): In a letter to the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, pointed out that the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan has created a situation fraught with the danger of an atomic war. Khrushchev emphasized that the severity of the international situation requires that all those who cherish the interests of peace and security unite to stop the aggression of the United States and Britain against the Arab East, strive for the immediate withdrawal of the interventionist troops, and prevent war disaster.

The letter said that the task of banning nuclear weapons is even more urgent because the United States and Britain continue to test nuclear weapons, threatening people's lives and health. The letter expressed deep sympathy to the crew members of the Japanese ships "Takuyo-maru" and "Satsuma-maru," who recently suffered from the US nuclear bomb tests.

Khrushchev pointed out that after the Soviet Union unilaterally stopped testing all types of nuclear weapons, other countries have no reason to refuse to stop such tests.

The issue of supervision cannot be used as a stumbling block either, because everyone knows that the Soviet Union not only does not oppose supervision, but on the contrary, has shown initiative and put forward concrete proposals for a supervision system for stopping experimental nuclear explosions.

Khrushchev wished the conference success in his letter.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The International Conference of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament continued its plenary session on the afternoon of the 16th. Thirty-six national flags were displayed on the podium of the conference hall, including the flag of the People's Republic of China.

Representatives from Algeria, Kiouan; Argentina, Soliria; Austria, Anders; Burma, U Dan Bin; Brazil, Pisania; Bulgaria, Pirinsky; Canada, George Noon; Ceylon, Tambiah; Finland, Mrs. Sivonen; France, Lefort; Netherlands, Bok; Hungary, Straub; Indonesia, Sukino; Italy, Sereni; Japan, Kazami Akira; International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Chari; and International Organization of Journalists, Fachelier, spoke at the meeting.

Representatives from Austria, Anders, and Bulgaria, Pirinsky, strongly denounced that the US's so-called "clean hydrogen bomb" is the most unclean lie. They said that the United States is doing the ugliest things under the cover of beautiful words.

The Algerian representative, Kiouan, pointed out that colonialism and "atomic mania" are completely inseparable. He said that all means must be taken to oppose de Gaulle's nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert.

Japanese representative Kazami Akira gave the final speech. He emphasized that the Chinese representatives could not participate in the conference entirely due to the Japanese government's hostile China policy.

Apart from the Japanese representatives, 123 representatives from 34 countries and 12 international organizations have arrived in Tokyo so far.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The International Conference of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament continued its plenary session this morning.

Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, gave a speech at the conference mourning the death of Dr. Joliot-Curie. Subsequently, Yasui Kaoru gave a general report on the conference.

In his report, Yasui Kaoru pointed out that since the Third World Conference, the public opinion of people around the world demanding a ban on nuclear tests has become stronger and more powerful. He said that after the Soviet Union unilaterally stopped nuclear tests, the United States and Britain still continued the tests in violation of the wishes of the people of the world, and the people of the whole world must not condone this behavior.

In his report, Yasui said that the basic task of this conference is to decide on specific policies to push the current political situation in the direction of peace, and at the same time, to work with all mankind in common action to practice the policies decided by the conference.

    赫鲁晓夫致函禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会
　　美英没有理由拒绝停止核试验
　　代表们指责美国“干净的氢弹”的说法是最不干净的谎话
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在写给第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会国际大会的贺信中指出，美国和英国对黎巴嫩人民和约旦人民的武装干涉造成了孕育着爆发原子战争危险的局势。赫鲁晓夫着重说，国际局势的严重性要求一切珍视和平和安全利益的人团结一致，制止美国和英国对阿拉伯东方国家的侵略，争取立即撤退干涉者的军队和防止战争灾难。
    贺信说，由于美国和英国继续试验核武器，威胁着人们的生命和健康，禁止核武器的任务就更加迫切了。贺信对不久前由于美国试验核弹而受害的日本“拓洋号”和“萨摩号”等船上的人员表示深切同情。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在苏联单方面停止试验一切类型的核武器之后，其他国家没有任何理由拒绝停止这种试验。
    监督问题也不能被说成是绊脚石，因为大家都清楚，苏联不仅不反对监督，相反地还表现出主动精神，就停止试验性核爆炸的监督体系提出了具体建议。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中祝这次大会成功。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会国际大会16日下午继续举行全体会议。大会会场讲台上插着三十六面国旗，其中有中华人民共和国的国旗。
    阿尔及利亚代表基乌安、阿根廷代表索里利亚、奥地利代表安德斯、缅甸代表吴丹彬、巴西代表彼萨尼亚、保加利亚代表皮林斯基、加拿大代表乔治·诺恩、锡兰代表坦比亚、芬兰代表希沃宁夫人、法国代表勒福、荷兰代表博克、匈牙利代表斯特劳布、印度尼西亚代表苏基诺、意大利代表塞伦尼、日本代表风见章和国际民主法律工作者协会代表查里、国际新闻工作者协会代表法歇尔在会上发言。
    奥地利代表安德斯和保加利亚代表皮林斯基异口同声强烈地指责说，美国的所谓“干净的氢弹”的说法是最不干净的谎话。他们说，美国在漂亮话的掩饰下干着最丑恶的勾当。
    阿尔及利亚代表基乌安指出，殖民主义和“原子迷”完全是分不开的。他说，要采取一切的手段反对戴高乐在撒哈拉沙漠进行核试验。
    日本代表风见章最后发表演说。他强调指出，中国代表不能参加大会，完全是由于日本政府的敌视中国政策所造成的。
    除日本代表以外，迄今到达东京的有三十四个国家和十二个国际组织的一百二十三名代表。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会国际大会今天上午继续举行全体会议。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在大会上作了悼念约里奥—居里博士逝世的讲演。随后，安井郁作了这次大会的总报告。
    安井郁在报告中指出，自从第三届世界大会举行以后，世界各国人民要求禁止核试验的舆论一天比一天强大有力。他说，在苏联已经单方面停止核试验以后，美英两国仍然违背世界人民的愿望继续进行试验，全世界人民对这种行为决不能宽恕。
    安井在报告中说，这届大会的基本任务在于决定具体方针，以便把现实政治推向和平的方向，同时要同全世界人类以共同行动来实践大会所决定的方针。
