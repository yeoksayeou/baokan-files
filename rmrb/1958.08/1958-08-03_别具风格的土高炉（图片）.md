    Unconventional Indigenous Blast Furnace
    Members of the Yingchao Iron Production Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, after the Rectification Movement, liberated their thinking, broke down superstitions, and created an unconventional indigenous blast furnace. This type of indigenous blast furnace is quick to build, costs little, is easy to operate, and has a high production efficiency. This is a photo of representatives from various regions visiting the indigenous blast furnace of the Yingchao Cooperative. Photo by Zhang Ruihua, our reporter
