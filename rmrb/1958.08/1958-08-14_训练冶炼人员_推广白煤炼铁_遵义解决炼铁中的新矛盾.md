According to the Guizhou Daily, the mass iron smelting movement in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, has entered a new stage. On the basis of comprehensively overfulfilling the blast furnace infrastructure construction tasks, they are making persistent efforts to vigorously grasp production.

As of the end of July, the county had built 1,189 blast furnaces, exceeding the original plan by more than 100. 277 have been put into production. The current problems are: few new furnaces have been put into production, accounting for only 23% of the total number of blast furnaces in the county. The blast furnaces that have been put into production should have a daily output of about 600 tons according to their production capacity, but most have not reached this production level. The main contradiction in organizing production at present is the difficulty in obtaining fuel and the lack of smelting technology. They calculated that if charcoal is used for iron smelting, the county's timber forests will be depleted in less than a year. It takes tens of thousands of laborers to cut wood and burn it into charcoal, and the cost of charcoal is high. It is for these reasons that most blast furnaces dare not start production after they are built. In terms of technical strength, although the county has established a technical army of 2,000 people after a period of hard work, most of them have only learned infrastructure construction technology and have not yet mastered smelting technology. Old furnace masters are generally only good at charcoal iron smelting and do not understand anthracite iron smelting.

In response to the above two key issues, the county has vigorously carried out the following two tasks since the end of July: First, seize the comprehensive promotion of anthracite iron smelting to kill two birds with one stone and break through the two major difficulties of fuel and technology. Under the help of the prefectural committee, the Zunyi County Party Committee established an anthracite iron smelting "experimental field" in Shangji District as early as June, and recently achieved a complete victory, and production is normal. Sanhe and Shanpen districts have also been successfully tested. The county party committee decided to set up on-site training classes in Shangji, Sanhe, and Shanpen to train more than 1,000 smelting technicians in different types of work. In order to ensure the supply of fuel, most districts in the county have established coal bases, and some districts have carried out activities such as "National Blitz Coal Preparation Day."

Second, with the focus on improving the output of blast furnaces, saving labor, and improving work efficiency, vigorously carry out technological innovation. According to the requirements of anthracite iron smelting, the county is vigorously solving the problems of air blowing and desulfurization. In late July, the county's relevant departments convened a field meeting in Tuoxi District with 38 iron and woodworking handicraft cooperatives in the county to promote the experience of Tuoxi District in manufacturing foot-operated wooden blowers. At the same time, the county party committee has summarized the experience of external desulfurization in Sanhe District and promoted it to the county.

　　训练冶炼人员　推广白煤炼铁
　　遵义解决炼铁中的新矛盾
    据贵州日报报道　贵州省遵义县的全民炼铁运动已经跨入一个新阶段，在全面超额完成高炉基建任务的基础上，一鼓作气，大抓生产。
    截至7月底止，全县已建成一千一百八十九座高炉，超出原计划一百多座；已投入生产的有二百七十七座，目前的问题是：新炉投入生产还较少，只占全县高炉总数的23％；已投入生产的高炉，按照它们的生产能力，日产量应达到六百吨左右，而目前一般都没有达到这个生产水平。目前组织生产的主要矛盾，一是燃料困难，二是冶炼技术不足。他们算了一笔细账，如果用木炭炼铁，不到一年就会把全县材林消耗光；从砍伐木材到烧成木炭，要占用数万劳动力，而且木炭成本高。正是由于上述原因，目前大部分高炉建好后不敢开工生产。在技术力量方面，经过前一阶段的努力，全县虽已建立起二千人的技术大军，但他们多数只学会了基建技术，还没有掌握冶炼技术。老炉师一般也只善长木炭炼铁，不懂无烟煤炼铁。
    针对以上两个关键问题，全县从7月底开始大力进行以下两项工作：第一，抓住全面推广无烟煤炼铁来一箭双雕，突破燃料、技术两大难关。中共遵义县委在地委帮助下，早从6月份起就在尚稽区建立了无烟煤炼铁“试验田”，最近已告全胜，生产正常。三合、山盆两区也已试验成功。县委决定在尚稽、三合、山盆等三个地方分别开办现场训练班，分别不同工种，训练千余名冶炼技工。为了保证燃料供应，全县大部分区都建立了煤炭基地，有的区开展了“全民突击备煤日”等活动。
    第二，以提高高炉产量，节约劳力，提高工效为中心，大搞技术革新。根据无烟煤炼铁的要求，全县正大力解决鼓风问题和去硫问题。7月下旬，县有关部门在团溪区召集全县三十八个铁木手工业社开现场会议，推广了团溪区制造脚踏木制鼓风机等经验。同时，县委已总结了三合区炉外去硫的经验，并向县推广。
