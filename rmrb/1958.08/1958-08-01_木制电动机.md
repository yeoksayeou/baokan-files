    Wooden Electric Motor
    (This newspaper reports) Encouraged by the General Line, Zhang Yunlin, a worker at the Jinhua Iron and Wood Farm Implement Cooperative Factory in Zhejiang Province, worked hard for five days and nights to create a 2.5 horsepower wooden electric motor. After on-site testing and evaluation, this wooden electric motor has the same effect as an iron motor, with strong power and fast speed.
    This wooden electric motor is constructed of wood, iron core, and enameled wire. Its cost is only 50 yuan (calculated at 2.5 horsepower), while an iron motor of the same horsepower costs more than 300 yuan. If we calculate based on the current need for 60 electric motors in Jinhua City's handicraft industry, we can save the country three tons of steel and reduce equipment investment by 18,000 yuan. At the same time, this wooden electric motor has a simple structure and is easy to operate, and can be manufactured in general iron and wood cooperatives.

    木制电动机
    本报讯　浙江省金华铁木农具合作工厂工人张云林在总路线的鼓舞下，苦战五昼夜，制成了一台二点五马力的木制电动机。这台木制电动机经过当场试验鉴定，效果和铁制马达一样，带动力很强，速度也快。
    这台木制电动机的构造是用木料，铁心，漆包线制成，它的成本只要五十元（按二点五马力计算）而铁制的同等马力马达则要三百多元，如果以金华市手工业目前需要六十只电动机计算，就能为国家节约钢铁三吨，减少设备投资一万八千元，同时这种木制电动机机构简单，操作容易，在一般的铁业，木业社都能制造。
