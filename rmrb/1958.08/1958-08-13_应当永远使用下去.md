　　“Should Be Used Forever”
　　Yi Yao
　　The great rectification movement is about to end. The rectification movement of more than a year has provided very rich experience for developing socialist democracy. Now, although the rectification movement is about to end, in order to promote socialist democracy persistently and extensively, and to advance our socialist construction, the spirit of the rectification should be maintained forever and implemented in future practical work.
　　During the rectification, the big-character posters, which once exerted great power, are a powerful weapon that we need to continue to maintain. Because as far as the rectification movement is concerned, it is indeed coming to an end. However, as far as socialist construction and even the communist cause are concerned, this unprecedentedly great movement is in full swing and will never end. In the rectification movement, because there are contradictions and struggles, big-character posters can play a role. In the future socialist construction, there are also contradictions and struggles, so why can't big-character posters continue to play a role?
　　In many units, big-character posters have become increasingly deserted in the late stage of the anti-rightist and rectification movements. Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reason is the lack of leadership and specific organizational measures. In this regard, it is necessary to continue to summarize and create new experiences. Today, the method of establishing big-character poster societies in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Sichuan Provincial Supervisory Committee organs introduced in this newspaper is worthy of attention by various units.
　　The establishment of big-character poster societies is a meaningful initiative in the development of big-character posters. As in the past, big-character posters are still written and managed by everyone,展开讨论和争辩， closely linked to the actual situation in the organs, to discuss and debate issues in the work and in the minds of the masses. The difference is that with a "society" for big-character posters, there can often be an organization to lead and organize this work, to discuss and solve problems in actual work in a more concentrated and planned way, so as to rapidly advance the work of the organs. This has found a specific measure for implementing the principle of "using big-character posters forever". Seeing the example of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' big-character poster society, some people who have discarded the weapon of big-character posters should be inspired and apply it well to their daily work.

　　“应当永远使用下去”
　　一遥
    伟大的整风运动即将结束了。一年多的整风运动，为发扬社会主义民主提供了非常丰富的经验。现在，整风运动虽然即将结束，但为了持久而广泛地发扬社会主义民主，推进我们的社会主义建设事业，整风的精神还需要永远地保持下来，并贯彻到今后的实际工作中去。
    在整风中，曾经发挥了巨大威力的大字报，就是我们需要继续保持的一个有力的武器。因为就整风运动来说，诚然是将要结束了。可是，就社会主义建设以至共产主义事业来说，这个空前巨大的运动却正在方兴未艾，它将永无结束的时候。在整风运动中，因为有矛盾、有斗争，所以大字报能够发挥作用。今后的社会主义建设事业中，同样有矛盾、有斗争，大字报为什么就不能够继续发挥作用呢？
    不少的单位，在反右派和整风运动末期，大字报日渐冷落了。为什么会出现这种现象呢？主要原因是缺乏领导和具体的组织措施。在这方面，必须继续总结和创造新的经验。今天本报介绍的邮电部和四川省监委机关建立大字报社的办法，是值得各单位重视的。
    建立大字报社，这在大字报的发展上是一个有意义的创举。和过去一样，大字报仍是大家写、大家办，针对工作中和群众思想中的问题展开讨论和争辩，密切联系机关中的实际。不同的是，大字报有了个“社”，就可以经常有一个机构来领导和组织这项工作，更集中、更有计划地讨论和解决实际工作中的问题，以便将机关工作迅速地推向前进。这就为贯彻执行把大字报“永远使用下去”的方针找到了一条具体的措施。看了邮电部大字报社的例证，一些丢掉大字报这个武器的人应当受到启发，很好地将它运用到日常工作中去。
