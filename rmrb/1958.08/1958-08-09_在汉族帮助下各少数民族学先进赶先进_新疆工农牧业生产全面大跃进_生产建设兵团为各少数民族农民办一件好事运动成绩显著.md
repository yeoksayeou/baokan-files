Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 8th. Under the help of the Han nationality, all ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, setting off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in industrial construction and agricultural and pastoral production.

On the industrial construction front, workers of all ethnic groups are working hard to build the autonomous region into one of China's bases for petroleum, steel, metals, coal, textiles, and sugar industries. From April this year to now, six thousand large and small factories have been built in northern and southern Tianshan Mountains. By the end of the year, another six thousand large and small factories in the machinery industry and more than one hundred iron-smelting blast furnaces will be built successively and put into production. At present, the petroleum, steel, machinery manufacturing, and textile industries are blooming everywhere in the autonomous region.

In the past few years, with the help of Han workers, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have built hundreds of modern factories and trained more than 30,000 skilled workers and more than 200 engineering and technical cadres. Since the Great Leap Forward this year, workers of all ethnic groups in many factories and mines have taken the production targets of fraternal factories and mines in the interior as their goals. Some factories and mines are improving enterprise management and technical operations based on the advanced experience of factories and mines in the interior. Some factories and mines also continue to send people to the interior to visit fraternal factories and mines and learn advanced experience. After the drilling workers of all ethnic groups of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration sent a visiting group to the Yumen Oil Mine, the average monthly drilling speed increased from more than 200 meters in the first quarter of this year to about 1,000 meters now. At the same time, workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enthusiastically learn from and help each other with Han workers. Many ethnic minority workers regard Han advanced workers as examples to catch up with. After Han car driver Su Changfu created a record of 400,000 kilometers of safe driving without major repairs, he became a red flag for tens of thousands of drivers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. Many ethnic minority workers in factories also took the initiative to sign technical learning contracts with Han veteran workers.

Under the slogan of "crossing the Yellow River and crossing the Yangtze River," more than 4 million farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region have been working hard for a winter, a spring, and a summer. While simultaneously reclaiming wasteland and increasing unit area yield, the high tide of water conservancy construction has continued to this day. The labor force invested in water conservancy has reached more than 28 million workdays, completing more than 99,500 channels, more than 300 reservoirs, and more than 1,500 karez wells. These projects have expanded the irrigated area by 4.89 million mu, provided sufficient water for the newly reclaimed 3 million mu of wasteland, and improved the irrigated area of more than 6.78 million mu, which is more than the total irrigated area expanded in the first Five-Year Plan. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, more than 158 billion jin had been completed by the end of July, exceeding six times that of last year. In addition to stockpiling manure, soil fertilizer has begun to be created everywhere.

Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres working in the vast rural areas often go deep into agricultural cooperatives and live, eat, and work with farmers of all ethnic groups to jointly manage experimental fields. Thousands of Han agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy technical cadres vigorously help farmers of all ethnic minorities to carry out agricultural technology reform, impart advanced experience to farmers of all ethnic groups, and help farmers of all ethnic groups summarize local high-yield experience. The mechanized farming and large-area high-yield experience of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps farm, which is mainly composed of Han people, has a profound impact on the Great Leap Forward of farmers of all ethnic groups. More than 4,000 technicians from agricultural cooperatives of all ethnic groups have gone to the Production and Construction Corps farm to learn the entire set of production technology. All of this has rapidly changed the agricultural appearance of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where the cultivation was originally extensive.

Herdsmen of the Kazakh, Mongolian, Kirgiz, and Tajik ethnic groups in the high-altitude and cold regions of Tianshan, Altai Mountains, and Pamir are currently seizing summer fat and harvesting winter grass for millions of livestock. They are setting off a Great Leap Forward in production to overfulfill this year's livestock production increase plan. This year, more than 20 animal husbandry counties in the autonomous region have expanded cultivated land and established grain and feed bases. Except for individual counties, they have guaranteed sufficient grain and feed for self-sufficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. Since the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps launched the movement to "Do More Good Deeds for Farmers of All Ethnic Minorities" this spring, the farms have provided various forms of assistance to 83 agricultural cooperatives and people of all ethnic groups, achieving great results.

In order to help nearby farmers develop production, the farms first provided great assistance in terms of manpower and materials. In the first half of this year, the 23rd Farm in the Shihezi Reclamation Area and the farms in the Yili Reclamation Area plowed more than 13,200 mu of land for the masses, supported six seeders, 14 foreign plows, and hundreds of other agricultural implements; supplied more than 2.507 million jin of seeds, more than 234,000 seedlings, and donated more than 300 jin of chemical fertilizer. During the dry season for winter wheat, the 24th and 30th farms released more than 7.44 million cubic meters of their own water to supply the local masses for planting rice and saving drought-stricken crops. In May this year, crops in the Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture suffered from insect pests. The Yili Reclamation Area immediately sent people with two tons of 666 powder and spraying equipment, and purchased 600 kerosene lamps from Yili overnight to support and help local farmers quickly eliminate the insect pests. The Production and Construction Corps also frequently sends technicians and production experts to agricultural cooperatives to impart technology, guide production, and train many farm implement handlers and management cadres for agricultural cooperatives.

The medical staff of the farms often travel tirelessly to various parts of Xinjiang to treat people of all ethnic groups. The 23rd and 24th farms alone treated more than 3,000 patients. The Shihezi Reclamation Area Hospital organized a mobile medical team in May to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives in Manas County for mobile treatment, treating 558 people in 13 days. This spring, an influenza epidemic broke out in a village in the Zegetai area of Xinyuan County. The 12th Farm of the Yili Reclamation Area immediately sent medical staff with medicines to treat more than 150 people without collecting medical expenses.

The soldiers of the farms also visited and consoled the people of all ethnic groups and held military-civilian get-togethers every time the Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic people celebrated festivals.

    新华社乌鲁木齐8日电  新疆维吾尔自治区各少数民族学先进、赶先进，在汉族帮助下掀起了工业建设和农牧业生产的大跃进高潮。
    在工业建设战线上，各族职工正以苦战精神要把自治区建成我国的石油、钢铁、金属、煤炭、纺织和制糖工业基地之一。从今年4月到现在，天山南北已建成了六千座大小工厂，到年底还有六千个机械工业的大小工厂和一百多座炼铁高炉要陆续建成，并且投入生产。目前，石油、钢铁、机械制造和纺织工业正在全自治区遍地开花。
    过去几年来，新疆各民族在汉族职工帮助下，建起了几百座现代化的工厂，并培养出三万多名技术工人、二百多名工程技术干部。今年大跃进以来，许多厂矿的各民族职工以内地兄弟厂矿的生产指标作为奋斗目标，有的厂矿各民族职工根据内地厂矿的先进经验来改进企业管理和技术操作，有的厂矿还不断派人到内地参观兄弟厂矿和学习先进经验。新疆石油管理局各民族钻井职工派参观团到玉门油矿参观后，钻井平均月速度从今年第一季度的二百多公尺，提高到现在的一千公尺左右。和这同时，新疆各民族职工并热情地和汉族职工互相学习、互相帮助。许多少数民族工人把汉族先进工人作为自己追赶的榜样。汉族汽车驾驶员苏长福创造安全行车四十万公里无大修的纪录后，成为自治区成千上万各民族驾驶员的一面红旗。许多工厂的少数民族工人还主动地和汉族老工人签订了学技术的合同。
    自治区四百多万各民族农牧民在“跨黄河、渡长江”的口号下，已经苦战了一冬一春又一夏。他们在开荒和提高单位面积产量并举下，兴修水利的高潮到现在持续不断。投入水利的劳动力已达两千八百多万工天，完成了九万九千五百多条渠道，三百多座水库和一千五百多道坎井。这些工程扩大了四百八十九万亩灌溉面积，使得新开垦的三百多万亩荒地获得了充足的水源，改善了六百七十八万多亩灌溉面积，比第一个五年计划扩灌面积的总和还要多。积肥方面，到七月底已完成了一千五百八十多亿斤，超过了去年的六倍。除堆积厩肥外，各地开始普遍创造土化肥。
    在广大农村工作的汉族干部和少数民族干部一起，经常深入农业社和各民族农民同吃、同住、同劳动，共同搞好试验田。数以千计的汉族农、林、牧、水利方面的技术干部，大力帮助各少数民族农民进行农业技术改革工作，向各族农民传授先进经验，帮助各族农民总结当地丰产经验。以汉族为主体的新疆军区生产建设兵团军垦农场机械化耕作和大面积丰产经验，对于各族农民大跃进更起着深远的影响。已有四千多名各族农业社技术员到军垦农场去学习整套的生产技术。所有这一切，都促使原来耕作粗放的新疆维吾尔自治区农业面貌迅速改观。
    在天山、阿尔泰山和帕米尔等高寒地区的哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜和塔吉克等族的牧民，目前正在为千百万头牲畜抓夏膘、打冬草。他们正在为超额完成今年牲畜的增产计划掀起了生产的大跃进。自治区二十多个畜牧业县份，今年都扩大了耕地，建立粮食饲料基地，除个别的县外，都保证粮食饲料自给有余。
    新华社乌鲁木齐电  新疆生产建设兵团在今年春天开展“多为各少数民族农民办一件好事”运动以来，各农场对八十三个农业社和各族人民进行了多方面的帮助，作出很大成绩。
    各农场为了帮助附近农民发展生产，首先在人力和物资上进行了大力帮助。今年上半年，石河子垦区二十三农场和伊犁垦区各农场，共为群众犁地一万三千二百多亩，支援播种机六架、洋犁十四架，其他农机具数百件；供应种子二百五十万七千多斤，树苗二十三万四千多棵，赠送化肥三百多斤。二十四、三十农场在冬麦枯水期间，把自己的用水放出七百四十四万多方，供给当地群众播种水稻和挽救受旱庄稼用。今年5月，博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州农作物遭受虫害，伊犁垦区立即派人携带两吨六六六药粉和喷雾器械，并从伊犁代购了六百个马灯，星夜赶往支援，帮助当地农民迅速消灭了虫害。生产兵团还经常派遣技术人员和生产能手到各农业社传授技术，指导生产，并为农业社训练了很多农具手和经营管理干部。
    各农场的医务工作人员经常不辞辛劳地奔走新疆各地，为各族人民治病。仅二十三、二十四两个农场，就治疗三千多病人。石河子垦区医院，在5月份组织一个巡回医疗工作组，深入玛纳斯县各农业社巡回治疗，在十三天中治疗五百五十八人。今春，新源县则盖台地区一个村庄发生流行性感冒，伊犁垦区十二农场立即派医务人员携带药物前往，治愈一百五十多人，未收药费。
    各农场的战士们还在每逢维吾尔、哈萨克等族人民欢度节日的时候，纷纷前往拜节、慰问，举行军民联欢。
