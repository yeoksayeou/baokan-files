　　(Report from our newspaper) Residents of Erlong Road in the Xidan District of Beijing, in the past half-month, have established two factories and more than ten kinds of processing and production groups. They have also successively opened canteens, nurseries, hot water supply stations, bathhouses, shops, neighborhood service stations, etc., enabling the vast majority of residents to go to production and work posts, each doing their best. They also cooperate with each other, moving production and life towards collectivization.

　　At the end of last month, the representatives of the residents of Erlong Road visited Hongshunli in Tianjin and were greatly encouraged by the communist style and collectivized experience of the residents of Hongshunli. On the day of their return, they held a meeting to convey the message and decided to immediately catch up with Hongshunli. They aimed for focused progress in five days and comprehensive results in ten days. After the meeting, men and women, old and young, mobilized to find work sources, dig up machines, and find talents, and mobilized the masses to set up small factories. They also held a forum for employees living on the street, asking them to offer suggestions. In a few days, they found eighteen hand-operated sock knitting machines that had become waste products. After repairs, all eighteen machines were put into operation on the 15th. The raw material used is recycled yarn from old socks. In addition, they found several dilapidated hand-operated small knife beds to process leather rivets for English typewriters. This kind of leather rivet is an export product, and many finished products have been produced in the past three days and are being packaged. In addition, the hat-making and shoe-making processing and production groups that have been established have all entered normal production. Each production unit has formulated a convention, and the enthusiasm for production is very high. They composed a song, which is also their action slogan:

　　Red Flag girls and satellite sisters,
　　Rocket aunts compete in a race;
　　Whether you are a hero or a good fellow,
　　Let's compete on the production front.

　　Adapting to this production need, various service industries run by the masses have also developed. A nursery that accommodates dozens of children charges only one yuan per child per month. Five babysitters from the District People's Committee dormitory (also on this road) use their spare time to provide free hot water for various production units. The canteens, bathhouses, and shops run by the masses are also very good and popular with the masses. More than seventy people eat here every day, and six families all come to the canteen to eat.

　　The neighborhood service station, sponsored by residents' activists, is an innovation of the masses. The service scope of this service station is very wide. It can purchase movie tickets and ball tickets, purchase train tickets, call taxis and night rickshaws, sell and deliver newspapers and periodicals, sell books, handle savings and exchange public bonds, pay rent, water and electricity bills, and property taxes, answer phone calls, answer directions, sell stamps, introduce babysitters and laborers, and can also help families lacking manpower to clean up... Everything is available. They serve twenty-four hours a day, and they serve very thoughtfully in everything entrusted to them, which is very popular among neighbors. In the past, few newspaper vendors came to this street. Now, they sell and deliver newspapers, and they have sold more than 2,770 copies of newspapers in thirteen days. This service station with a communist style has caused a huge impact among neighbors and in society.

　　二龙路居民大搞生产
    本报讯　北京市西单区二龙路上的居民，半个月来，办起了两个工厂，和十多种加工生产组，并先后开办了食堂、托儿所、开水供应站、淋浴室、商店、邻里服务所等等，使绝大部分的居民都各尽所能的走上了生产和工作岗位，并彼此协作，使生产生活迈向集体化。
    上月底二龙路的居民代表从天津参观鸿顺里回来，对鸿顺里居民的共产主义风格和集体化的经验，大受鼓舞。回来的当天，就开会传达，决定立刻就赶鸿顺里。要五天重点开花，十天全面结果。会后，男女老少齐动员，找活源、挖机器、找人材，发动群众办小工厂。并召开居住本街上的职工座谈会，请他们出谋划策。几天工夫，他们找到了十八部已成废品的手摇织袜机，经过修理，这十八台机器已于15日全部开工了。使用的原料是拆旧袜线。另外又找到几部破烂的手摇小刀床，加工英文打字机上用的皮带钉。这种皮带钉是出口产品，三天来已经制出了不少成品，进行包装。此外成立的制帽加工生产组，制鞋加工生产组等等，都已进入正常生产。每个生产单位都订出了公约，比生产的劲头很大，他们编了一首歌，也是他们的行动口号：
    红旗姑娘卫星嫂，
    火箭大娘齐赛跑；
    是英雄是好汉，
    生产战线上比比瞧。
    适应这种生产的需要，群众自办的各种服务性事业，也开展起来。一个收容几十个儿童的托儿所，每个孩子一月只收一元钱。区人民委员会宿舍（也在这条路上）的五个保姆在工余用义务劳动供应各生产单位饮用的开水。群众自办的食堂、浴室和商店也很好，很受群众欢迎，每天在这里吃饭的已有七十多人，有六户全家都到食堂来吃。
    由居民积极分子主办的邻里服务所，更是群众的一个创举。这个服务所服务的范围很广，可以代购影戏票和球票，代购火车票，代叫出租汽车和夜间雇三轮，代售代送报纸刊物，代卖书籍，代办储蓄、兑换公债，代交房租、水电费和房地产税，传呼电话，回答问路，代售邮票，介绍保姆与壮工，还可以帮助缺少人手的家庭打扫卫生……应有尽有，他们每天服务二十四小时，凡是托他们办的事情，服务得十分周到，很受邻里们的欢迎。过去卖报的很少来到这条街上，现在，他们代售代送报纸，十三天中便售出了二千七百七十多份报纸。这个具有共产主义风格的服务所，已在邻里间和社会上引起了巨大的影响。
