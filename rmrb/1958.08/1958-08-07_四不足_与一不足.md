    "Four Insufficiencies" and One Insufficiency
    Wang Pu
    It would be unrealistic to think that since the Great Leap Forward, there are no more difficulties. For example, some places are now encountering the problem of "four insufficiencies," which are insufficient labor, insufficient technical strength, insufficient equipment, and insufficient raw materials. But the question is how we view these insufficiencies. Some people, because of the "four insufficiencies," are singing a tune of insufficient confidence. They say: "If you want me to make a Great Leap Forward, to strive for the top, then you must give me labor, give me technical strength, give me equipment, and give me raw materials!" In reality, these words mean they don't want to leap forward, don't want to strive for the top.
    "Four insufficiencies" do exist objectively in many places. Anyone who doesn't acknowledge this is not a materialist. However, do these "four insufficiencies" mean that we are doomed to not be able to make a Great Leap Forward, to not be able to strive for the top? No. If we waited until all the conditions were ready, until all the difficulties were gone, and then formulated a leap forward plan, and then completed the plan effortlessly, what would that be called boosting morale and striving for the top? What we mean by boosting morale and striving for the top is not some unspeakable abstract thing, but has specific standards. This standard is overcoming difficulties. Whoever can overcome numerous difficulties and advance by leaps and bounds is boosting morale and striving for the top; whoever sighs and gives up in the face of difficulties has no drive and is content to be in the middle or lower reaches.
    Everything develops in the struggle of contradictions. Objective conditions can be changed. Where there is a spear, there must be a shield; where there is a difficulty, there must be a way to overcome it; the difficulty itself contains the factors for overcoming it. "Four insufficiencies" are a bad thing, but at the same time they are also a good thing, because they can stimulate our drive, just as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work hard, to make revolution." The lack of steel materials and modern equipment inspires us to work hard to build indigenous and small blast furnaces and converters, inspires us to vigorously carry out the "anti-drought" movement; the lack of technical strength inspires us to vigorously carry out the "multi-skilled worker" movement, inspires us to find all kinds of craftsmen and transferred technical personnel among the masses; the shortage of labor inspires us to vigorously carry out technical innovation, improve the efficiency of equipment and tools, inspires us to adjust labor organization, save a large number of labor forces, and mobilize women to the production front. Since the beginning of this year, the experience of many previously industrially underdeveloped areas building tens of thousands of small factories self-reliantly has proved the dialectical truth that negative factors can be transformed into positive factors under certain conditions. The objective conditions of "four insufficiencies" can indeed be changed. Here, the decisive factor is to mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people and their initiative in developing the productive forces.
    However, to mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people and their initiative in developing the productive forces, to bring into play their subjective initiative, the primary key is to believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses. The working masses, who have rich practical experience in production, are the most intelligent. They have created many indigenous methods for building factories quickly, well, and economically, created many indigenous methods and experiences for rapidly increasing production, and created many indigenous machines that can improve labor efficiency. Summarizing and promoting their experience can greatly change the conditions of "four insufficiencies" and leap forward again and again. However, those who believe that the existence of "four insufficiencies" means that a Great Leap Forward cannot be made look down on these indigenous methods and experiences and do not believe that they can solve the problem. When they encounter difficulties, they don't look downward, towards the masses, but look upward, reaching out to the higher authorities. Therefore, for them, the so-called "four insufficiencies" are essentially just "one insufficiency" – insufficient belief in and reliance on the masses. This is the root cause of singing the low key of "four insufficiencies."
    Now that the root cause has been found, we must prescribe the right medicine: look downward, completely believe in the masses, and completely rely on the masses!

    “四不足”与一不足
    王朴
    如果认为大跃进以来，什么困难都没有了，这当然是不实际的。例如，现在有些地方就碰到“四不足”的问题，这就是劳动力不足、技术力量不足、设备不足、原材料不足。可是问题在于我们如何看待这些不足。有那样一些人因为“四不足”而唱出了信心不足的调子。他们说：“你们要我大跃进，要我争上游，就要给我劳动力，给我技术力量，给我设备，给我原材料！”这些话，实际上，就是不想跃进，不想争上游。
    “四不足”在不少地方确是客观存在。谁不承认这一点，就不是唯物论者。然而这“四不足”，是不是就注定不能大跃进，不能争上游呢？不。如果等到一切条件都准备好了，一切困难都不存在了，再订出跃进计划，然后毫不费气力地就完成计划，这又叫什么鼓足干劲、力争上游呢？我们所说的鼓足干劲、力争上游，并不是不可言喻的抽象的东西，而是有具体的标准的。这个标准就是克服困难。凡是能够战胜重重困难，大踏步前进的，就是鼓足干劲、力争上游；凡是在困难面前唉声叹气，举手交枪的，就是没有干劲，甘居中游或下游。
    任何事物都在矛盾的斗争中发展着。客观条件是可以改变的。有矛必有盾，有困难必有克服困难的办法，困难本身就包含有克服困难的因素。“四不足”是坏事，但同时也是好事，因为它可以激发我们的干劲，正像毛泽东同志所说的：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”没有钢铁材料、没有现代设备，激发我们大干特干土的和小的高炉和转炉，激发我们大搞特搞“抗旱”运动；技术力量不足，激发我们大搞特搞“多面手”运动，激发我们到群众中去找各种工匠和各种转业的技术人才；缺少劳动力，激发我们大搞特搞技术革新，提高设备和工具效率，激发我们调整劳动组织，省出大批的劳动力来，动员妇女到生产战线上来。今年以来，许多原来工业很不发达的地方，自力更生地建设起数以万计的小工厂来的经验，都证明了这一条消极因素在一定条件下可以变为积极因素的辩证道理。“四不足”的客观条件的确是可以改变的。在这里，决定的因素是把人民群众的革命干劲和发展生产力的积极性调动起来。
    然而，要调动人民群众的革命干劲和发展生产力的积极性，要发挥他们的主观能动作用，首要的关键就是相信群众的智慧和力量。具有丰富的生产实践经验的劳动群众是最聪明的。他们创造了许多能够多快好省地建设工厂的土办法，创造了许多能够迅速增加生产的土办法和土经验，创造了许多能够提高劳动效率的土机械。总结和推广他们的经验，就可以大大改变“四不足”的条件，跃进再跃进。但是，那些认为“四不足”的存在就不能大跃进的人，却看不起这些土办法、土经验，不相信它们能够解决问题。他们有了困难，不是眼睛向下，面向群众，而是眼睛向上，伸手向上级要。因此，对他们来说，所谓“四不足”，实质上只是“一不足”——相信和依靠群众不足。这就是唱“四不足”低调的病根所在。
    病根找出来了，就要对症下药：眼睛向下，彻底相信群众，彻底依靠群众！
