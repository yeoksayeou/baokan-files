    Anshan Iron and Steel and Hebei Province Workers Repeatedly Set New Records in Steel Production Increase
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 30th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Lou Baoheng, Sun Minghui): Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking plant workers have recently launched successive high-yield "satellites" in the past week, with the average daily steel production increasing by approximately 11% compared to the first two weeks of August.

    After creating a new daily production record on the 22nd, with a steel production increase of 343 tons more than the Great Leap Forward plan, the First Steelmaking Plant workers created a new daily production record on the 25th, exceeding the previous highest record by nearly 500 tons of steel. On the same day, the Second Steelmaking Plant created a new daily production record exceeding the previous highest record by more than 100 tons of steel; on the 27th, they created an even newer record, with daily steel production increasing by 575 tons compared to the previous highest record.

    These high-yield steelmaking "satellites" emerged after the criticism of the passive "waiting for conditions" mentality and the hard work of the broad masses of workers. The new production achievements have further inspired the workers' enthusiasm. Now, the broad masses of steelmaking workers are determined to launch even larger high-yield "satellites" in the future to ensure the completion of this year's Great Leap Forward production plan.

    The highest targets of the Great Leap Forward plan for Anshan Iron and Steel's various steelmaking plants were set in the later part of the second quarter. To achieve the Great Leap Forward plan, many of the increase production measures proposed by the plants required the higher authorities to resolve them, including increasing large-scale equipment and carrying out basic construction projects. Some of these measures were simply impossible to achieve in a short period of time, while others required mobilizing the masses to solve them. Due to the fact that many cadres had a "waiting for conditions" mentality in the past, they did not fully mobilize the masses, resulting in most of the measures not being implemented, and the Great Leap Forward production plan was not completed well. Not long ago, when these steelmaking plants were inspecting and rearranging this year's production plans, some cadres lacked confidence in completing the Great Leap Forward plan. They believed that without the higher authorities helping to solve difficulties in equipment and other aspects, it would be difficult to achieve the Great Leap Forward plan. Under the specific assistance of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party committees of these plants mobilized the workers to speak out freely and criticize the erroneous ideology of passively waiting and not creating conditions themselves, pooling their wisdom and efforts to carry out measures, and as a result, they quickly reversed the situation in which the production plan had not been completed well in the past, and production gradually improved.

    As early as half a year ago, the Second Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel proposed measures to increase coke oil spraying equipment, but they relied on the higher authorities to increase infrastructure construction forces and did not take effective measures, so it has not been implemented. More than ten days ago, they criticized the passive waiting mentality and actively mobilized the workers of the plant to install the equipment themselves. Within a few days, they installed the coke oil spraying equipment for two open-hearth furnaces. It is expected that this equipment can be installed on all open-hearth furnaces in early September, which can shorten the steelmaking time by half an hour. The First Steelmaking Plant originally proposed that to achieve the Great Leap Forward plan, the higher authorities needed to help implement twenty-one measures such as adding cranes; now, the workers have decided to implement these measures themselves. In the past, they proposed that to expand the open-hearth furnace charging capacity, the higher authorities must solve the problem of equipment such as cranes and large molten steel ladles. Due to difficulties in ordering, these measures were not implemented. Recently, by mobilizing the masses, adopting methods such as shortening the crane and molten steel ladle maintenance time, and extending the ingot casting platform themselves, they have begun to solve the difficulty of expanding the charging capacity of some open-hearth furnaces. A few days ago, the workers of the No. 9 open-hearth furnace of this plant used a small crane for maintenance instead of the large crane that was originally planned to be ordered from outside, and changed the molten iron ladle to a molten steel ladle, which has increased steel production by 20%.

    In the process of implementing increase production measures themselves, the steelmaking workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have formed a new atmosphere of overall collaboration and joint overcoming of difficulties. When the No. 4 open-hearth furnace of the First Steelmaking Plant was being repaired, every open-hearth furnace in the plant sent people to help, greatly shortening the furnace repair time; raw material workers, charging machine operators, and equipment repair workers all tried to shorten the charging and equipment repair time, cooperating with the open-hearth furnace workers to shorten the steelmaking time. The Communist Youth League members and young workers of this plant have also recently organized a "Youth Rocket Team" to help open-hearth furnaces solve production difficulties in their spare time.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 30th: Hebei Province's steel production is progressing rapidly. From the 22nd to the 26th, in five days, various regions have mined more than 130,000 tons of ore, put into production more than 1,300 small blast furnaces and indigenous iron-smelting furnaces, and smelted more than 1,340 tons of pig iron.

    Since the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held broadcast conferences on the 20th and 21st, a massive steel blitz has been launched in various regions. From special districts to counties, townships, and communes, from cadres to the masses, everyone has taken action. The province's iron-smelting army has reached approximately 150,000 people. In the Baoding area, the number of people going to the mountains to mine and smelt iron has increased to more than 69,000. Laiyuan County transferred more than 160 cadres and 1,600 people to engage in iron-smelting. Many prefectural and county Party committees have formed steel production headquarters, led by the first secretaries. Various regions have more and more methods, and high yields continue to emerge. The No. 2 small blast furnace with a volume of 15 cubic meters in the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant leapt to create a record of producing 30.032 tons of pig iron per day on August 24th. The indigenous furnace in Gaochang Township, Tang County, which created the highest record for indigenous furnace production in the province, originally had a record of producing 1,759.2 catties per day. On August 22nd, it created an even higher record of producing 2,262.5 catties per day. The Yangcheng-style indigenous furnace in Xiabaishi, Wu'an, also reached a daily production of 2.35 tons of white pig iron.

    Various regions are actively and proactively overcoming difficulties in equipment, technology, and raw materials. Tangshan and Shijiazhuang have organized furnace opening teams to solve the technical problems of furnace opening. Chengde organized a steel brigade of more than 1,000 people to provide technical guidance in various regions. Zhangjiakou trained laboratory personnel to master the composition of ore and ran training classes for boiler camel engines and blowers. In terms of equipment, various regions are trying their best to solve the problem themselves. Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Tangshan, and other places are manufacturing their own blowers. Zhangjiakou will be able to produce 20 blowers by the end of the month.

    On the evening of the 26th, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference with various prefectural committees to review the steel production situation in various regions. It was believed that the progress of steel production in these five days was very rapid, but the production of iron was still far from sufficient according to the requirements. Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, pointed out that the shortage of steel is the main contradiction on the current industrial production front. Only by completing the steel production plan can the entire industrial production leap forward be driven, and conditions can be created for agricultural production and water conservancy. He called on various regions to focus on steel production as the center in leading industrial production and strive to overfulfill the plan. All regions must proceed from the overall interests, oppose localism and decentralism, and resolutely ensure the completion of the national plan. (Attached photo)

　　任何困难难不倒有心人
    鞍钢和河北省职工连创钢铁增产新纪录
    新华社鞍山30日电　新华社记者楼葆蘅、孙铭惠报道：鞍钢的炼钢厂职工在最近一周来连放丰产“卫星”，使钢的日产量平均比8月上中两旬猛增11％左右。
    第一炼钢厂职工继22日创造的比跃进计划增产三百四十三吨钢的日产新纪录以后，25日又创造了比过去最高纪录增产钢近五百吨的日产纪录。在这同一天，第二炼钢厂创造了比过去最高纪录增产一百多吨钢的日产纪录；27日又创造了更新的纪录，钢的日产量比过去最高纪录增加五百七十五吨。
    这些炼钢丰产的“卫星”，是在批判了“坐等条件”的消极等待思想、广大职工大干苦干的情况下出现的。新的生产成就，更加鼓舞了职工们的干劲。现在，广大的炼钢职工决心在今后放出更大的丰产“卫星”，保证完成今年的生产跃进计划。
    鞍钢各炼钢厂的跃进计划最高指标都是在第二季度后期订出的。为了实现跃进计划，各厂提出的增产措施有许多都是要求上级给解决的，其中包括增加大型设备，进行基本建设等项目。这些措施有些一时根本无法实现，有些需要发动群众才能解决。由于过去一个时期，不少干部存在着“坐等条件”的思想，没有充分发动群众，结果大部分措施都没有实现，生产跃进计划完成得不够好。不久前，这些炼钢厂在检查和重新安排今年生产计划的时候，有些干部对完成跃进计划缺乏信心。他们认为上级不帮助解决设备等方面的困难，跃进计划很难实现。在中共鞍山市委具体帮助下，这些厂的党委会发动职工大鸣大放，批判了消极等待、不自己动手创造条件的错误思想，群策群力大搞措施，结果短期内就扭转了过去一个时期生产计划完成不好的局面，生产步步提高。
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂早在半年前就提出了增加喷焦油设备的措施，但是由于他们依赖上级给增加基建力量，没有采取有效措施，一直没有实现。十多天前，他们批判了消极等待思想，积极发动本厂职工自己动手装设，几天之内，就安装好了两个平炉的喷焦油设备，预计在9月初全部平炉都可以安装上这种设备，这样可使炼钢时间缩短半小时。第一炼钢厂原来提出实现跃进计划需要上级帮助实现增添吊车等二十一项措施；现在，职工们决定自己动手实现这些措施。过去，他们提出要扩大平炉装入量，必须上级给解决吊车、大钢水罐等设备，由于订货困难，这些措施没有实现。最近通过发动群众，采用了缩短吊车和钢水罐检修时间、自己动手延长铸锭平台等办法，开始解决了部分平炉扩大装入量的困难。这个厂九号平炉职工在前几天利用检修用的小吊车代替原计划向外订货的大吊车，把铁水罐改为钢水罐，已经使钢产量增加20％。
    鞍钢的炼钢工人们在自己动手实现增产措施的过程中，已经形成了一种全盘大协作、共同克服困难的新风气。第一炼钢厂四号平炉进行补炉时，全厂每座平炉都派人来帮助干，大大缩短了补炉时间；原料工人、装入机手、设备修理工人，都设法缩短了装料和修理设备的时间，配合平炉工人缩短炼钢时间。这个厂的共青团员和青年工人们，最近还组织了“青年火箭队”，利用业余时间帮助平炉解决生产上的困难。
    新华社天津30日电　河北省钢铁生产进展很快，从22日到26日的五天中，各地已开采出矿石十三万多吨，投入生产的小高炉、土炼铁炉一千三百多座，炼出生铁一千三百四十多吨。
    自从中共河北省委在20、21日先后举行广播大会以后，各地就展开了规模巨大的钢铁突击战。从专区到县、乡、社，从干部到群众都行动起来，全省炼铁大军已达到十五万人左右，保定地区上山采矿炼铁的已增加到六万九千多人。涞源县抽调一百六十多个干部、一千六百多群众大搞炼铁。许多地委、县委都组成了钢铁生产指挥部，由第一书记挂帅。各地办法愈来愈多，高产不断出现。石家庄钢铁厂十五立方公尺二号小高炉在8月24日一跃创造了日产生铁三十点零三二吨的纪录。创全省土炉产量最高纪录的唐县高昌乡土炉，原来纪录是日产一千七百五十九点二斤，8月22日再创日产二千二百六十二斤半的更高纪录。武安下白石阳城式土炉也达到日产白口铁二点三五吨。
    各地都在积极主动地克服设备、技术及原材料方面的困难。唐山、石家庄组织了开炉队，解决开炉的技术问题。承德组织了一千多人的钢铁大队，到各地进行技术指导。张家口训练了化验人员，掌握矿石的成分，并办了锅驼机、鼓风机训练班。在设备方面，各地都尽量自己解决，张家口、承德、唐山等地都在自制鼓风机，张家口月底就可以生产鼓风机二十台。
    26日晚，中共河北省委又召开了各地委的电话会议，检查了各地钢铁生产的情况，认为这五天的钢铁生产进展是很快的，但是铁的生产，按照要求来讲还很不够。省委书记处书记解学恭指出，钢铁不足是当前工业生产战线上的主要矛盾，必须完成钢铁生产计划才能带动整个工业生产跃进，也才能替农业生产、水利创造条件。他号召各地在领导工业生产中，要突出地抓住钢铁生产这个中心，力争超额完成计划。各地都要从整体利益出发，反对本位主义、分散主义，坚决保证国家计划的完成。（附图片）
