In Jigang Township, Sichuan Province, the hometown of martyr Huang Jigang, the anger against the American and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East has been ignited, just as it has across the country. Over the past ten days, the people here have held rallies, demonstrations, and signed petitions to protest the aggressive crimes of the United States and Britain. The people of the martyr's hometown vow to use Huang Jigang-style heroic actions to sever the claws of American and British imperialist aggression.

The martyr's mother, Deng Fangzhi, director of the Jigang Agricultural Cooperative, feels particularly angry about the aggressive actions of American and British imperialism. As soon as she received the news of the American and British aggression in the Middle East, she immediately ran to her neighbors to announce: "American and British imperialism are starting fires in the Middle East again! These mad dogs bit us once, and now they are biting the people of Lebanon and Jordan. We must resolutely oppose them and extinguish their flames of aggression!" She also convened an emergency meeting of cooperative cadres, deciding to launch widespread propaganda to make the Middle East events known to every household and turn anger into strength.

On the afternoon of July 18, sixty-seven-year-old Mother Huang, carrying a petition against American and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, braved the scorching sun to go to the fields to solicit signatures from the cooperative members. When she arrived at a late rice experimental field, the cooperative members were busy carrying manure and transplanting rice seedlings. She asked the cooperative members: "American and British imperialism have sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan. What should we do?" The cooperative members replied in unison: "We resolutely disagree and demand that they get out immediately!" Huang Shixiu, a female labor model, said to Mother Huang: "We must do a good job in production and produce more grain to strengthen the country's power to defend peace and smash the war provocations of American and British imperialism." Mother Huang said: "We all oppose the aggressive actions of American and British imperialism, please sign your names!" So, more than sixty cooperative members working in this field, disregarding washing their hands and feet, quickly ran to the field ridges to sign their names. At the same time, everyone revised the yield target of this late rice experimental field again, deciding to increase it from the original 10,000 catties per mu to 40,000 catties.

In order to strengthen the country's power to defend peace, all members of the Jigang Cooperative put forward the slogan "Strive for a bumper autumn harvest and sell more good grain to the country." The cooperative members have revised the production increase targets several times in a row. The yield of late rice has been increased from 600 catties per mu to 1,200 catties per mu, and the yield of cotton has been increased from 80 catties per mu to 150 catties per mu. The production increase plans for sweet potatoes and corn have also been doubled. The cooperative members also seized the time to dry the early rice and millet and sell them to the state. In just one day at the end of July, the cooperative members braved the scorching sun to send more than 6,000 catties of public grain and surplus grain into the granary.

Mother Huang wrote a letter to her fourth son, Huang Jishu, and grandson, Huang Zhongda, who are serving in the army, telling them about the situation of the people in her hometown supporting the just struggle of the people in the Middle East. In the letter, she instructed: "You are the descendants of the hero's mother. Jigang blocked the enemy's machine guns with his chest. In the Battle of Shangganling, the American and British aggressors were beaten so badly that they fled with their heads in their hands. His heroic actions are your example. Today, when American and British imperialism are madly invading the Middle East, you must hold your weapons tightly and be ready to meet the invaders at any time and defend world peace."

    继光乡的反侵略怒火
    本报记者　陈捷、游云谷
    在黄继光烈士的故乡——四川省中江县继光乡，同全国各地一样燃起了反对美英帝国主义侵略中东的怒火。最近十多天来，这里的人民纷纷集会、游行示威和签名，愤怒抗议美英的侵略罪行。烈士故乡的人民，誓以黄继光式的英雄行为来斩断美英帝国主义的侵略魔爪。
    烈士的妈妈、继光农业社主任邓芳芝，对美英帝国主义的侵略行为特别感到愤怒。她一得到美英侵略中东的消息，就立即向四邻奔告：“美英帝国主义又在中东点火啦！这些疯狗，曾经咬了我们，现在又去咬黎巴嫩和约旦人民，我们要坚决反对，扑灭它们的侵略火焰。”她并召集社干部开了一个紧急会议，决定展开广泛宣传，要使中东事件家喻户晓，把愤怒化为力量。
    7月18日的下午，六十七岁的黄妈妈带着反对美英帝国主义侵略中东的签名书，冒着烈日奔到田间去征求社员们签名。当她来到一块晚稻试验田的时候，社员们正在忙着挑粪、插秧。她向社员们问道：“美英帝国主义已经出兵侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，我们该怎么办？”社员们齐声回答：“我们坚决不答应，叫它们马上滚出去！”妇女劳动能手黄士修向黄妈妈说：“我们要搞好生产，多打粮食，来增强祖国保卫和平的力量，粉碎美英帝国主义的战争挑衅。”黄妈妈说：“我们大家都反对美英帝国主义的侵略行为，请来签个名吧！”于是，在这块田里干活的六十多个社员，顾不得洗手洗脚，赶快跑上田坎来签了名。同时大家还重新修订了这块晚稻试验田的增产指标，决定由原来的亩产一万斤增加到四万斤。
    继光社全体社员为了增强祖国保卫和平的力量，提出了“力争秋季大丰收，多卖好粮食给国家”的口号。社员们接连几次修订了增产指标，晚稻由亩产六百斤提高到一千二百斤，棉花由亩产八十斤提高到一百五十斤，红苕、玉米的增产计划也都翻了一番。社员们还争取时间把早稻谷子吹干风净，卖给国家。社员们仅7月底的一天，就冒着烈日送了六千多斤公粮和余粮入仓。
    黄妈妈把家乡人民声援中东人民正义斗争的情况，写信告诉了正在部队服役的四儿子黄继恕和孙子黄中达。她在信中嘱咐说：“你们是英雄母亲的子孙，继光以胸膛挡住敌人的机枪，上甘岭战役中打得美英侵略军抱头鼠窜，他的英雄行为就是你们的榜样。今天当美英帝国主义疯狂侵略中东的时候，你们必须紧握武器，随时准备迎击侵略者，保卫世界和平。”（附图片）
