　　The Anti-Democratic Nature of De Gaulle's "Constitution"
　　By Yang Xiaonong, Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Paris
    The draft of De Gaulle's new "constitution" has aroused strong opposition from democratic forces in France, and even some centrists have expressed varying degrees of dissatisfaction with the draft.

    Opposition and dissatisfaction are primarily focused on the actual cancellation of parliamentary power. Progressive opinion here, in analyzing the new draft constitution, points out that although the draft stipulates that parliament still seems to have legislative power, the numerous restrictions actually render it powerless. The role it can play is merely to pass bills agreed to by the government, entrusting it to go through the formalities of passage. These restrictions on parliament and the unlimited expansion of presidential power constitute the prominent characteristics of this dictatorial "constitution."

    Observers point out that the new draft constitution constrains the actions of parliament in four ways.

    First, the new draft constitution places three restrictions on the functions of parliament. One, although Article 31 stipulates that parliament has the right to legislate, it limits the scope of legislation to the so-called "principles" of a handful of matters, while other bills that should be decided by parliament are listed in Article 33 as "regulations" to be decided by the government, transferring them from the hands of parliament to the government. In this way, the legislative power of parliament is effectively reduced to a mere formality. For example, parliament can discuss the principle of the right to work, but the length of paid leave for workers is decided by the government; parliament can discuss the fundamental rules of social insurance, but the rate of allowances is decided by the government, and so on. This allows the government to cancel parliament's legislation in the actual implementation of these "principles," rendering parliament's legislative power meaningless. Two, even within the scope stipulated in Article 31, parliament cannot freely determine its own agenda. According to Article 44, parliament should give priority to discussing bills submitted by the government. This makes it easy for the government to complicate matters by forcing parliament to put aside issues it does not want it to discuss. Three, when discussing government proposals, according to Article 39, parliament can only modify the parts that the government agrees to it modifying.

    Fearing that these three articles would not be enough to weaken parliament's legislative power to meet his dictatorial demands, De Gaulle constrained it from another aspect, which is the establishment and role of the Senate. This Senate, elected indirectly and guaranteed to have an absolute majority controlled by right-wing figures, is essentially established to check the National Assembly. Article 5 of the new draft constitution stipulates that the President of the Senate shall temporarily exercise the powers of the President of the Republic during the President's absence, which means that the President of the Senate plays the role of the second most important figure in the country, making the Senate's position higher than that of the National Assembly. Moreover, according to Article 40, when the National Assembly passes a bill that the government does not like, the Senate can express its disagreement; and when the two houses cannot reach an agreement within two months, the government can force the National Assembly to agree to the government's opinion. The restraining role of the Senate in legislation is even more evident in the decision on the budget. Article 42 stipulates that if the National Assembly cannot pass the budget in the first reading within one month, the government can submit it to the Senate for a decision within fifteen days; if the discussion in parliament is inconclusive within two months, the government can put the budget into effect in the form of an order.

    Articles 26, 27, 45, and 46 of the new draft constitution provide new constraints on the National Assembly from a third aspect. Article 26 stipulates that parliament will hold only two regular sessions a year, with a total session period of no more than five and a half months. Article 27 states that special sessions of parliament can only be convened by the government or at the request of a majority of parliamentarians. This greatly limits the duration of the National Assembly's activities, allowing it to convene for less than half a year to exercise legislative power. In addition, although the new draft constitution stipulates that the Prime Minister must resign if parliament passes a motion of censure against the cabinet, it imposes four more shackles to bind the National Assembly from exercising this power: First, the motion of censure must be signed by more than one-tenth of the parliamentarians; second, this number must be gathered within three days of the government submitting the bill to file impeachment, otherwise, it will be considered that they agree to trust the government; third, if the parliament's motion of censure against the government is rejected, they will not have the right to file a new motion of censure within four months; fourth, abstentions are counted as votes supporting the government. These four shackles are tantamount to canceling parliament's power to impeach the government.

    Not satisfied with these many restrictions on parliament, De Gaulle further constrained parliament's power from a fourth aspect, namely, Articles 58 and 60 of the new draft constitution concerning the Constitutional Council, which stipulates that the Council has the right to reject laws passed by parliament on the pretext of being "unconstitutional," and these laws called "unconstitutional" will not be promulgated by the President. In addition to including figures who have served as president, the members of this committee are appointed by the president, the president of the Senate, and the president of the National Assembly, each designating three persons, and the chairman of the committee is designated by the president. This can ensure that this institution becomes a tool that looks to the president's every move and strangles all laws passed by parliament but disagreed with by the government in the name of "unconstitutionality." Not only that, but according to Article 8 of the new draft constitution, the President should promulgate the bill passed by parliament within fifteen days of receiving it. However, if the President refuses to promulgate it, what method is there to urge the President to accept the parliamentary proposal? The new draft constitution does not mention a single word. It does not stipulate to whom the President's actions should be responsible, but only stipulates in Article 64 that the President is only responsible to the people when he commits treason. In other words, all other actions of the President in the exercise of his duties are not responsible to anyone.

    According to the new draft constitution, the President also controls four methods to stifle the activities of parliamentarians. First, Article 54 stipulates that the Constitutional Council can rule on whether the election of members of the National Assembly and the Senate is "regular" when electoral disputes occur. This can be interpreted as: the Constitutional Council has the right to declare the election invalid and thus cancel the parliamentarian status of the elected parliamentarian when it deems it "irregular." Second, Article 34 stipulates that the government can, after the passage of the bill it has submitted, request parliament to authorize it to fully deal with certain issues within a certain period. It can act freely without parliamentary supervision. Third, Article 10 stipulates that the President can announce the dissolution of parliament and hold general elections after consulting the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Parliament. Fourth, Article 14 stipulates that the President can take "necessary" measures in so-called "emergency" situations. Parliament will be reconvened when circumstances permit. That is to say, parliament will be adjourned indefinitely. - With these four articles, the power of whether parliament exists or not is entirely in the hands of the President.

    It is easy for people to see through De Gaulle's intention to further implement personal dictatorship through his new "constitution" draft. The reason why De Gaulle retained the parliament is only to make the parliamentarians the kind of people who are picked to pass the bills that he is willing to submit to the parliament, and to use this to paint a deceptive protective color on his "constitution," nothing more.

    But this kind of deceptive trick is in vain. Isn't the movement launched among the French people to reject this "constitution" draft in the September 28th referendum, as well as the condemnation of this draft by some figures in the ruling class who are not willing or dare to abandon the republican system, the best explanation?

　　戴高乐“宪法”的反民主性质
　　新华社驻巴黎记者　杨效农
    戴高乐的新“宪法”草案公布后，引起了法国民主力量的强烈反对，甚至一部分中间分子也对这一草案表示了不同程度的不满。
    反对和不满，首先集中在对议会权力的实际取消上。这里的进步舆论在分析新宪草时指出，这个草案尽管规定议会似乎仍然有立法权，但是重重的限制实际使它无能为力。它能起的作用，只不过是通过为政府同意的、委托它履行一下通过手续的法案而已。对议会的这些限制和总统权力的无限扩大，构成了这部独裁“宪法”的耀眼特点。
    观察家指出：新宪草从四个方面约束了议会的行动。
    首先，新宪草对议会的职能作了三道限制。一，在第三十一条中，虽然规定议会有权立法，但把立法的范围限制在屈指可数的几项事务的所谓“原则”方面，而其他本应由议会决定的法案则用第三十三条把它们列为应由政府决定的
  “规章”，从议会手中转入政府掌握。这样，实际上就使议会立法权力成为徒具形式。例如，议会可以讨论劳动权的原则，但是工人工资照付的假期的长短则由政府决定；议会可以讨论社会保险的根本规则，但是津贴的比率则由政府决定，等等。这就使政府可以在实际执行这些“原则”时取消议会的立法，使议会的立法权成为毫无实际意义的东西。二，议会即使在第三十一条所规定的范围内，也不能自由规定自己的议事日程。按第四十四条规定，议会应该优先讨论政府提交的议案。这就便于政府节外生枝地迫使议会放下政府不愿意它讨论的问题。三，在讨论政府的方案时，按第三十九条的规定，议会实际上只能修改政府同意它修改的部分。
    戴高乐唯恐这三条不足以把议会的立法权削弱到足以适应其独裁要求的地步，于是又从另一方面来进行约束，这就是参议院的设立和作用。这个由间接选举产生的、可以保证右派人物控制其中的绝对多数票的参议院，实质上是为了牵制国民议会而设立的。新宪草第五条规定，在总统离职期间参议院议长暂行总统职权，这意味着参议院议长起着国家第二号人物的作用，使参议院的地位高于国民议会。不但如此，根据第四十条，当国民议会通过了一项为政府所不乐意的法案时，参议院可以表示不同意；而在两个月中两院不能取得一致意见时，政府即可以压迫国民议会同意政府的意见。参议院在立法中所起的牵制作用，在预算案的决定中更为明显。第四十二条规定，如果国民议会不能在一个月内对预算案一读通过，政府就可以提交参议院在十五天内作出决定；如果议会在两个月内讨论无结果，政府就可以以命令形式使预算案生效。
    新宪草第二十六、二十七、四十五、四十六等条，又从第三方面给国民议会以新的约束。第二十六条的规定，议会一年只举行两次例会，会期一共不超过五个半月。第二十七条载明，议会的特别会议，只能由政府召集，或者由多数议员提出要求。这就大大限制了国民议会的活动期限，使它一年中只有不到半年能集会行使立法权。此外，在新宪草中尽管规定议会通过弹劾案内阁总理就得辞职，但是又安上四个枷锁来束缚国民议会行使这一职权：第一，必须邀集十分之一以上的议员签署弹劾案；第二，必须在政府提出议案后三天之中集合起这个数目才能提出弹劾，否则即认为同意信任政府；第三，如果议会对政府的弹劾案被否决，在四个月内就再也没有提出新的弹劾案的权利；第四，弃权票算作支持政府的票。这四个枷锁不啻取消了议会对政府进行弹劾的权力。
    戴高乐对议会作了这许多限制还不满足，他还从第四方面进一步约束了议会的权力，这就是新宪草第五十八条和第六十条关于宪法委员会的规定，它规定这个委员会有权借口“违宪”来否决议会通过的法律，而这些被称为“违宪”的法律，总统是不予公布的。这个委员会的成员除包括曾经做过总统的人物外，其他九人由总统、参议院议长及国民议会议长各指定三人，而委员会主席则由总统指定。这就可以保证这个机构成为仰总统的鼻息、以“违宪”名义绞杀一切经议会通过而政府却不同意的法律的工具。这还不算，按照新宪草第八条，总统本应在接到议会通过的法案后十五天中予以公布。但是，如果总统拒绝公布，有什么方法来促使总统接受议会方案，新宪草却只字不提。它没有规定总统的行动应该对谁负责，而只是在六十四条中规定，总统只有作出叛国行为时才对人民负责。换句话来说，总统在行使职权中的其他一切行为都不对任何人负责。
    按照新宪草，总统还掌握四种方法来扼杀议会议员的活动。第一，五十四条规定，宪法委员会在选举发生争端时，可以裁决国民议会及参议院议员选举是否“正规”。这可以解释为：宪法委员会有权在认为“非正规”时，宣布选举无效，从而取消获选议员的议员资格。第二，三十四条规定，政府可以在它所提出的法案通过后，要求议会授权在一定时期内全权处置若干问题。它可以不受议会监督，自由行事。第三，第十条规定，总统可以在征询总理和议长的意见后宣布解散议会，进行大选。第四，第十四条规定，总统可以在所谓“紧急”情况下采取“必要”的措施。议会只有在环境许可时再行召集。这就是说，议会将无限期休会。——有了这四条，议会存在与否的大权，就完全操在总统手中了。
    人们很容易透过戴高乐的新
  “宪法”草案看出他要进一步实行个人独裁的意图。戴高乐之所以保留议会，不过是为了要使议员成为被挑出来通过一下他所愿意交付议会通过的法案的那种人物，并且借此为他的“宪法”涂上一层骗人的保护色，仅此而已。
    但是这种骗人的手法是徒劳无功的。在法国人民中掀起的要在9月28日的公民投票中否决这个“宪法”草案的运动，以及统治阶级中一些还不愿意或者不敢背弃共和制度的人物对这个宪草的谴责，不正是最好的说明吗？
