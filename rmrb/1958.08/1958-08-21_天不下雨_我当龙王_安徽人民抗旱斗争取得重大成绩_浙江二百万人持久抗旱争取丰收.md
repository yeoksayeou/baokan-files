　　"If Heaven Doesn't Send Rain, We Will Be Dragon Kings"
    Major Achievements in Anhui People's Struggle Against Drought
    Zhejiang's Two Million People Persist in Fighting Drought to Strive for a Bumper Harvest
    (Our dispatch) The people of Anhui Province, with soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, have been fighting against the severe drought and have achieved brilliant results in the past three months. In the situation where there has been no soaking rain for more than ninety days, the province has successfully sown more than 69 million mu of autumn-harvested crops. The early rice planted in the fight against drought has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Now, the middle rice is growing vigorously, and 5 million mu of late rice has been transplanted. The drought-resistant crops in various places are also growing well. This is an unprecedented miracle in a year of severe drought.
    During this year's plum rain season, there was very little rainfall throughout the province. The rainfall in May, June, and July, whether in southern Anhui, central Anhui, or northern Anhui, was generally 200 to 300 millimeters less than in the same period last year, with the largest decrease being more than 600 millimeters. So far, many areas in the province, especially central and southern Anhui, have not had a soaking rain for more than ninety days.
    Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the General Line, the people of the entire province have mustered soaring enthusiasm and launched a large-scale struggle to fight drought and rush planting and to fight drought and protect seedlings. During the most intense period of drought fighting in June and July, more than 12 million people throughout the province were engaged in drought fighting day and night. People in various places put forward many magnificent slogans, such as "Split mountains to draw water to the hills, commune members themselves become dragon kings!" "Show heroism under the red flag, pick up Chaohu Lake as a water ladle, not afraid of the sky not raining, water wherever it is lacking!" "As long as the Yangtze River does not stop flowing, we can seize a bumper harvest!" The people in various places not only mustered soaring enthusiasm but also displayed infinite wisdom. Farmers in Chaoxian, Lujiang, Shucheng, and Feixi counties adopted a method of large-scale cooperation, digging water diversion canals, and using waterwheels to turn the water layer by layer through dozens of procedures, causing the water of Chaohu Lake to flow backwards for more than 160 li, irrigating 1.03 million mu of drought-stricken farmland. The people of Shouxian County dug ditches to force the Pi River to change its course and diverted the water of the Huai River over the dikes, irrigating nearly 2 million mu of farmland. A "thousand springs and ten thousand wells" campaign was launched in the hilly areas between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers.
    In the past three months, the achievements of the drought resistance movement in Anhui Province have been enormous. According to the latest statistics from the Provincial Drought Resistance Headquarters, the province has built 320,000 river dams, dug 310,000 deep ditches and ponds, opened 660,000 water diversion ditches, dug 8.98 million wells, and found 1.04 million springs and underground springs. A thousand pumping machines with a total of more than 20,000 horsepower were put into drought resistance, and more than 3 million pieces of water lifting tools were used. After more than three months of hard work, the severe drought was finally overcome, ensuring the normal growth of most crops.
    The drought resistance struggle in various parts of Anhui Province is still continuing. The drought resistance movement has been closely integrated with water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and field management, both solving the current drought problem and preparing for autumn planting.

    (Our dispatch) More than two million people in drought-stricken areas of Zhejiang Province are persistently fighting drought. They are using various methods to fight drought and protect the autumn harvest and strive for a greater bumper harvest. Many areas in Zhejiang Province have been suffering from drought and lack of rain since late May, and some have not had a soaking rain for two consecutive months. After the drought resistance struggle, more than 3 million mu of farmland are still affected by drought. According to materials from relevant departments, Zhejiang Province has historically lacked rain in the autumn, and the rainfall this autumn may be less than in previous years.
    During this period, the leading departments in various drought-stricken areas have successively launched large-scale debates among cadres and the masses on whether or not to ensure a bumper harvest and how to overcome the drought, criticized some people's paralyzing thoughts, waiting-for-rain thoughts, and pessimistic views, and further promoted everyone's enthusiasm for drought resistance.
    The methods of persistent drought resistance adopted by the broad masses in drought-stricken areas are diverse. The most important are digging wells and springs and building dams across rivers. At present, there are more than 1.41 million wells in the province for drought resistance. At the same time, the work of digging underground water pools and building underground reservoirs is also being carried out vigorously in these areas. Many new tools are being used to fight drought. The province has nearly 100,000 horsepower of pumping machines for drought resistance. Pinghu County built 1,074 windmills for water lifting in nine days. Many other areas are also installing ball bearings on closed-type waterwheels. Now, many drought-stricken areas have put forward a method of combining water management and drought resistance, using this opportunity to carry out water conservancy infrastructure construction and improve drought resistance capabilities.

　　“天不下雨  我当龙王”
    安徽人民抗旱斗争取得重大成绩
    浙江二百万人持久抗旱争取丰收
    本报讯  安徽全省人民以冲天的干劲和无穷的智慧与严重的干旱进行斗争，三个多月来已获得辉煌的成绩。在九十多天不下透雨的情况下，全省的秋收作物胜利播种六千九百多万亩。抗旱栽种的早稻，已获得空前丰收，现在中稻生长很旺盛，晚稻已栽秧五百万亩，各地的旱粮作物也生长良好。这是大旱之年空前未有的奇迹。
    今年的霉雨季节，全省很少下雨，5、6、7月的雨量，不论江南、淮南和淮北，一般都比去年同期减少二百到三百公厘，最多少六百多公厘。到现在为止，全省很多地区，特别是淮南及江南地区，已有九十多天没有下过透雨。
    全省人民在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓起冲天干劲，开展了规模巨大的抗旱抢种和抗旱保苗的斗争。在6、7月份抗旱最紧张的时候，全省每天夜以继日进行抗旱斗争的有一千二百多万人。各地人民提出了许多气魄雄伟的口号，例如“劈山引水上山岗，社员自己当龙王！”“大红旗下逞英豪，端起巢湖当水瓢，不怕老天不下雨，那方缺水那方浇！”“只要长江不断水，就能夺取大丰收！”各地人民不但鼓起冲天干劲，而且发挥了无穷的智慧，巢县、庐江、舒城、肥西四个县农民采取大协作的办法，开挖引水渠，经过几十道手续，用水车层层翻水，使巢湖水倒流一百六十多里，灌溉受旱农田一百零三万亩。寿县人民开沟迫使淠河改道，翻淮水过堤，灌溉农田近二百万亩。在江淮之间的丘陵地区开展了“千泉万井”运动。
    三个多月来，安徽省抗旱运动的成绩非常巨大。据省抗旱指挥部最近统计，全省共打拦河坝三十二万处，挖深沟塘三十一万处，开引水沟六十六万条，打井八百九十八万眼，找泉、下泉一百零四万处。投入抗旱的抽水机一千台，共两万多马力，使用提水工具达三百多万件，经过三个多月的苦战，终于战胜严重干旱，保证了大部分庄稼的正常成长。
    安徽省各地的抗旱斗争现在仍在继续进行。抗旱运动已经与兴修水利、积肥和田间管理等工作密切结合起来，既解决当前的抗旱问题，又为秋种做好准备。
    本报讯  浙江省受旱地区二百多万人持久抗旱，他们采用各种办法，抗旱保秋，争取更大丰收。浙江省不少地区自5月下旬以来天旱缺雨，有的已经连续两个月未下过透雨，经过抗旱斗争，目前受旱农田还在三百万亩以上。根据有关部门的材料，浙江省历年来秋季缺雨，今年秋季雨量可能还少于往年。
    在这期间，各受旱地区的领导部门纷纷在干部、群众中开展要不要保丰收、如何战胜旱灾的大辩论，批判某些人的麻痹思想、等待下雨思想和悲观论调，进一步发扬大家的抗旱热情。
    受旱地区广大群众持久抗旱的办法是多种多样的。最主要的是打井挖泉和拦河筑坝。目前全省已有一百四十一万多眼供抗旱使用的井。与此同时，挖地下水潭、造地下水库的工作也在这些地区轰轰烈烈地进行着。很多新式工具被利用来抗旱。全省投入抗旱的抽水机拥有近十万马力。平湖县在九天内就造了一千零七十四部风力水车。还有不少地区正在将封闭式水车装上滚珠轴承。现在，不少受旱地区又提出了治水和抗旱相结合的办法，利用这一时机，进行水利基本建设，提高抗旱能力。
