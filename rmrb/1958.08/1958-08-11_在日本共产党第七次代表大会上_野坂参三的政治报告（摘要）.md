Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Tokyo news: "Akahata" published an extra edition on the 9th, announcing the political report made by former First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party (now Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party) Nozaka Sanzō at the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party. This report was adopted at the closing meeting of the JCP "Seventh Congress" on August 1.
    The report is divided into three parts: (1) The fundamental changes in the international situation and the major changes in the domestic situation in Japan over the past decade; (2) The current tasks of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese working class; (3) On the issue of the Party.
  (I) The fundamental changes in the international situation and the major changes in the domestic situation in Japan over the past decade
    The first part of the report first points out that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is in a superior position to the imperialist camp headed by the United States, and that the unity of the socialist camp and its consistent policy of peace are the most realistic forces for preventing war and defending peace; under the profound influence of the development of the socialist camp, the national liberation movement has spread to the whole world, and the colonial system is on the verge of complete collapse; the communist and workers' movements in capitalist countries have been significantly developed, encouraged by the brilliant development of the socialist camp; due to the development of socialism and the advance of the national liberation movement, the scope of the imperialist camp's rule is shrinking day by day, and the internal class contradictions within imperialist countries and the contradictions between imperialist countries are intensifying.
    The report points out that the fundamental characteristic of changes in the international situation is that the powerful socialist forces and their consistent peace policies constitute the conditions for peaceful coexistence between the socialist and capitalist systems, and at the same time, make the struggle of the people of all countries around the world to win peace an irresistible torrent. All this is gradually forming the possibility of preventing war. On the other hand, a fierce struggle is going on between the peace policies and war policies of the two systems. The opposition between the socialist camp, which adheres to the policies of peace and progress, and the imperialist camp, which pursues the policies of war and reaction, is the basic contradiction in the international situation.
    The report emphasizes that in such an international situation, Japan's position and tasks in Asia are becoming more and more important. Because Japan is standing at a crossroads, in the future it will either become the largest base for war and reaction in Asia, or it may rely on the strength of the people to strive for independence and autonomy, thus becoming a force for peace and progress in Asia. The report says that if Japan continues to follow the war policy of US imperialism, making Japan a missile base for the United States, and at the same time reviving Japanese imperialism, then Japan will embark on the former path; conversely, if Japan establishes friendly relations with socialist countries, and joins hands with Asian and African countries in the struggle for peace, independence and democracy, then Japan will embark on the latter path.
    The report then points out that major changes have also taken place in the domestic situation in Japan over the past decade: from being under the complete occupation of the United States to being in a state of semi-occupation, and at the same time forming the "San Francisco Treaty" system in which Japan is in fact a subordinate country of the United States; Japanese monopoly capital is subordinate to the United States on the one hand, but is also reviving and strengthening on the other; the democratic forces in Japan have greatly developed.
    The report particularly points out that the characteristic of the current domestic situation in Japan is that although the mutual contradictions between US imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital are developing, the two are still stepping up their collusion and attacking the working class and the people of Japan. Therefore, the struggle between reactionary forces and democratic forces has reached a new and fierce stage.
    The report points out that the US policy towards Japan is not only to make Japan the largest aggressive stronghold of the United States in Asia, but also to make Japan an atomic war base for the United States. The focus of the current US policy towards Japan is to promote Japan's open nuclear armament and make Japan an important link in the US aggressive policy. The US missile base in Okinawa is about to be completed, the United States is continuing to advance the atomic base in the Japanese mainland, and at the same time, it is attempting to equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States is supporting Japan's collusion with Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee to form a Northeast Asian military alliance.
    The report emphasizes that the US policy of strength lies in gathering reactionary forces around the world, preparing to launch a new war against socialist countries, and interfering and invading Asian and African countries. The policy towards Japan, as an important part of this adventurous policy of the United States, lies in strengthening the alliance between the United States and Japanese monopoly capital and all reactionary forces, preventing Japan from approaching China and the Soviet Union, and making Japan hostile to China and the Soviet Union again, supporting the Japanese government's suppression of all democratic movements, and supporting the revival of Japanese militarism.
    The report points out that since the United States launched the Korean War, the Japanese economy has developed rapidly, and industrial production has reached two and a half times the pre-war level, its development speed is higher than any capitalist country. The report points out that the economic power of Japanese monopoly capital has revived and strengthened during this period, and it is now gradually completing the basis for the revival of imperialism. Production and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few monopoly enterprises, and the degree of concentration has exceeded that before the war. Japanese monopoly capital controls state institutions, uses state power to plunder the people, and at the same time arbitrarily uses state funds to further strengthen the system of state monopoly capitalism. The report says that Japanese monopoly capital is enthusiastically pursuing the "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan," attempting to export capital to Southeast Asia, Arab countries, and South America, and attempting to launch a battle for international markets, and then establish its economic sphere of dominance. At present, this ambition for external expansion is burning like fire.
    The report emphasizes that Japanese monopoly capital is facing the contradiction between the expansion of production scale and the narrowness of the domestic market, and the recent economic panic has further sharpened this contradiction. Therefore, monopoly capital attempts to expand externally. However, with the progress and development of the socialist system and the fundamental changes in the situation in Asia today, Japanese monopoly capital is unable to carry out external expansion alone. At the same time, their attempt to develop imperialist military power and military industry has also been strongly resisted by the Japanese people. This is why Japanese monopoly capital, on the one hand, harbors the ambition to revive imperialism and promote militarism, but on the other hand, it cannot but utilize the state of dependence on the United States. This is also the treasonous characteristic of Japanese monopoly capital selling out national interests. Monopoly capital entrusts itself to the adventurous policy of the United States, attempting to obtain US aid, rebuild Japanese militarism, resist the developing socialist camp and national liberation movement, and re-engage in imperialist aggression in Asia. The aggressiveness of Japanese monopoly capital is combining with the aggressiveness of US imperialism, forming a major danger to peace in Asia.
    The report points out that the Japanese economy has gradually entered a state of panic since July of last year, and Japan is facing serious economic difficulties. Therefore, the battle between reactionary forces and democratic forces is about to reach a major stage.
    The report points out that the main reactionary policies of the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet are: to exchange US aid by implementing the US war policy and promoting Japan's nuclear armament, to realize the so-called Southeast Asia development desired by Japanese monopoly capital; to openly adopt a hostile attitude towards China, in fact creating a state of severance of Sino-Japanese relations, and if Kishi Nobusuke's cabinet's attitude is forgiven, it will bring great harm to the Japanese people; in order to establish a militarist system, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is carrying out the deprivation of some of the democratic systems and rights won by the Japanese people after the war, and preventing the development of democratic forces.
    The report points out that the emergence of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet shows that the struggle between monopoly capital and reactionary forces moving towards militarism and the working class and the people moving towards democracy has reached a new and important stage.
    The report points out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of reviving militarism will inevitably be strongly opposed by the people of the world and Asia, as well as the Japanese people. The report points out that the Japanese people today are no longer the Japanese people before the war, and their fighting strength is increasing and developing.
  (II) The Current Tasks of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese Working Class
    The second part of the report points out that since the establishment of the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the Japanese people have felt the danger of nuclear armament and political fascism, and more and more people are looking for effective ways and paths of struggle.
    The report says that the JCP, in response to the rule and policies of US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, must point out to all people who demand peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards the path they should take, and unite the strength of these people to form a force against subservience to the United States and the revival of militarism. This is the basic task of the JCP as the vanguard of the working class.
    The report says that the current tasks of the Japanese Communist Party are divided into eleven items:
    1. The two declarations adopted by the Communist and Workers' Parties at the Moscow Conference should be taken as the JCP's action guide, and at the same time, the ideas of the two declarations should be thoroughly instilled into all the people, and all the people should be united to struggle for the promotion of the cause of peace. We should stand on this basis to oppose all aggressive war plans of the imperialists. If they dare to launch a war, no matter when or where, in order to prevent aggression, we must organize mass actions in a timely manner and resolutely launch a struggle at the forefront. This is the noble task that the JCP, as a member of the international communist movement and in accordance with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, should perform. Therefore, the JCP must adhere to an internationalist stance in leading the struggle to safeguard peace, and conduct the struggle under the strengthening of international cooperation and unity. Without the international unity and cooperation of peace advocates all over the world, it is impossible to prevent the danger of war and safeguard world peace.
    2. Oppose the policy of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party of nuclear armament of Japan, oppose Japan's assistance to the United States in preparing for atomic war, and oppose the revival of Japanese militarism, and advocate changing the current policy of the Japanese government into a peace policy that maintains world and Asian peace, and establishes peaceful, friendly and equal relations with all countries. There are four goals in this struggle: (1) Strive for the immediate and unconditional cessation of nuclear weapons tests, and then achieve a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons, and prevent the danger of atomic war; (2) In order to prevent the plan of turning Japan into an atomic war base, we must not only oppose the import of nuclear weapons into Japan, prevent the nuclear armament of the "Self-Defense Forces," and urge the Kishi Nobusuke government to declare Japan a nuclear-free country, but also launch a struggle to abolish all US military bases in Japan; (3) Oppose military alliance policies and smash Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to collude with Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to establish a "Northeast Asian military alliance," and establish a collective security system in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the Soviet Union and China; (4) Oppose the policy of hostility towards socialist countries, demand the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, North Korea, and Vietnam, and the establishment of friendly relations with Asian and African countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The report also pointed out that the movement to maintain peace should be developed into a struggle against the Japanese government's attempt to revive militarism.
    3. Launch a powerful national movement to concentrate attacks on the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and oppose the policy of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party to be hostile to China and assist US imperialism and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group to launch a war against China. This struggle has two goals: (1) Urge the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to change its hostile policy towards China; (2) Abolish the so-called "Japan-Chiang Treaty" and strive to restore normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
    4. Oppose the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's attempt to consolidate the "San Francisco system" subservient to the United States and revive militarism, and launch a struggle to break the "San Francisco system" and restore Japan's peace and independence. This struggle should achieve: the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement," the revision of the Japan-US Peace Treaty, striving for the unconditional return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan, and achieving the withdrawal of all US troops from Japan and the abolition of US military bases.
    5. Launch a struggle against the establishment of a militarist political system and preventing the revision of the Peace Constitution, maintain the democratic rights and democratic education of the Japanese people, and strive for the thorough democratization of politics. There are three goals in this struggle: (1) Prevent the implementation of the "small constituency" system and the revision of the Constitution, strive to abolish all laws and decrees that restrict the democratic rights of the people, and change the current election system to a democratic election system of proportional representation; (2) Oppose all measures to suppress progressive parties and trade unions as well as democratic movements, abolish police politics and ideological police systems, and maintain the freedom of political activities and trade union movements; (3) Prevent the "service evaluation" system imposed on teachers and maintain democratic education. The report points out that the struggle to maintain democracy is now facing a serious situation. The various democratic systems and rights won by the Japanese people after the war are increasingly being undermined and are in danger of being completely destroyed.
    6. Oppose the policy of getting rid of the economic panic by sacrificing the interests of the working people in order to guarantee the super-profits of monopoly capital, and strive to improve the living standards of the working class and the working people and the peaceful development of the economy.
    7. The biggest task of the JCP at present is to promote the unity and unification of the entire working class, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and establish a national democratic united front on this basis to unite all working people and progressive forces. There are five important tasks in establishing and developing the national democratic united front at present: (1) Organizing and developing unified actions of the masses; (2) Strengthening the relationship between the party and mass organizations, supporting the movements and organizational development of mass organizations, and cultivating them into strong forces in the united front; (3) Raising the awareness of the working class, the leader of the people's united front, and making them grow into a real leading class; (4) The united front must be built on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance. Only when the party goes deep into the masses and expands the party's influence among the masses and peasants can the worker-peasant alliance be established; (5) Establishing cooperative relations between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.
    8. In the struggle to establish a united front and establish a democratic government, parliamentary activities and election struggles are becoming more and more important. We must sum up past experiences and actively prepare for the local elections and Senate elections to be held next year from today.
    9. The JCP attaches particular importance to the significance of education issues and opposes the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's forced implementation of the reactionary "service evaluation" system. The JCP will stand at the forefront of the struggle to support democratic education with all its strength.
    10. The JCP attaches importance to the ideological struggle of the working class and the people when launching a struggle against monopoly capital and reactionary forces.
    11. The JCP, together with the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries, bears the great historical task of eliminating the old world of oppression and exploitation and establishing a new world of freedom and peace without exploitation. The JCP supports the socialist camp and supports the development of the world socialist system. The JCP also supports all countries, parties, groups, and individuals and related movements that are struggling for peace and national independence, for democracy and social progress. The JCP respects the principle of proletarian internationalism, strengthens mutual trust with brother parties in various countries, and supports the struggle of brother parties.
    The report also put forward the current action guidelines for the Japanese Communist Party in order to promote the struggle of the people of all strata in Japan.
  (III) On the Issue of the Party
    The third part of the report talked about the issue of the party, summed up the party's achievements and shortcomings since the Sixth Party Congress, and mentioned the party's construction guidelines in the future.
    The report also emphasized that the JCP must conduct a thorough struggle against revisionism.

　　在日本共产党第七次代表大会上
　　野坂参三的政治报告（摘要）
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”在9日发行号外，公布了前日本共产党第一书记
  （现为日本共产党中央委员会主席）野坂参三在日本共产党第七次代表大会上所作的政治报告。这个报告是在日共“七大”8月1日的闭幕会议上通过的。
    报告共分三部分，（一）过去十年来国际形势的根本变化和日本国内形势的重大变化；
  （二）日本共产党和日本工人阶级当前的各项任务；（三）关于党的问题。
  （一）过去十年来国际形势的根本变化和日本国内形势的重大变化
    报告的第一部分首先指出，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营比以美国为首的帝国主义阵营处于优势地位，社会主义阵营的团结一致和它的一贯的和平政策是阻止战争和保卫和平的最现实的力量；在社会主义阵营发展的深刻影响下，民族解放运动扩展到全世界，殖民地制度濒于全面崩溃；资本主义各国的共产主义运动和工人运动受到社会主义阵营辉煌发展的鼓舞，有了显著的发展；由于社会主义的发展和民族解放运动的前进，帝国主义阵营的统治范围一天比一天狭小，帝国主义各国内部的阶级矛盾和帝国主义各国相互间的矛盾都在尖锐化。
    报告指出，国际形势变化的根本特征是，强大的社会主义力量及其一贯的和平政策构成了社会主义和资本主义两个体系间和平相处的条件，同时使全世界各国人民争取和平的斗争也变成所向无阻的奔流，这一切逐渐形成足以阻止战争的可能性。另一方面，两个体系之间的和平政策和战争政策正进行着激烈斗争。坚持和平与进步政策的社会主义阵营和执行战争与反动政策的帝国主义阵营的对立是国际形势中的基本的矛盾。
    报告强调，在这样国际形势下，日本在亚洲的地位和任务一天比一天重要。因为，日本正站在十字路口，今后或者变成亚洲的战争和反动的最大基地，但也可能依靠人民的力量争取独立与自主，从而变成亚洲的和平与进步的力量。报告说，如果日本继续追随美帝国主义的战争政策，使日本变成美国的导弹基地，同时使日本的帝国主义复活，那么日本就走上了前一条道路；相反地，如果日本同社会主义各国建立友好关系，并且同亚非各国携手合作，进行争取和平、独立与民主的斗争，那么日本就走上了后一条道路。
    报告接着指出，过去十年日本国内的形势也发生了重大变化：从处于美国的完全占领下变成处于半占领状态，同时形成了日本在事实上成为美国从属国的“旧金山和约”体系；日本垄断资本一方面从属于美国，但另一方面也在复活和加强；日本的民主势力有了巨大的发展。
    报告特别指出，当前日本国内形势的特点是，美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的相互矛盾虽在发展，但两者仍在加紧勾结，向日本的工人阶级和人民进攻，因此，反动势力和民主力量的斗争达到新的激烈阶段。
    报告指出，美国的对日政策是，不仅使日本成为美国在亚洲最大的侵略据点，并且使日本成为美国的原子战争基地。美国目前对日政策的中心在于促进日本公然进行核武装，使日本成为美国侵略政策的重要环节。美国在冲绳的导弹基地即将完成，美国正在继续推进日本本土的原子基地，同时还企图用核武器和导弹装备日本“自卫队”。美国正支持日本和蒋介石、李承晚互相勾结，进行组织东北亚军事同盟。
    报告强调指出，美国的实力政策在于集合全世界反动势力，准备对社会主义各国发动新战争，并且干涉和侵略亚非各国。作为美国这种冒险政策的重要部分的对日政策，在于加强美国和日本垄断资本以及全部反动势力的同盟，阻止日本和中、苏接近，并且使日本重新与中、苏为敌，支持日本政府对一切民主运动的镇压，支援日本军国主义的复活。
    报告指出，自从美国发动朝鲜战争以来，日本经济迅速发展，工业生产达到战前水平的二倍半，它的发展速度高于任何资本主义国家。报告指出，日本垄断资本的经济力量在这个时期复活和加强了，而且目前逐渐地完成了帝国主义复活的基础。生产和资本集中于少数垄断企业手中，集中的程度已经超过战前。日本垄断资本把持国家机构。利用国家权力掠夺人民，同时任意使用国家资金，使国家垄断资本的体系更为加强了。报告说，日本垄断资本正热心于“开发东南亚基金计划”，企图对东南亚、阿拉伯各国和南美进行资本输出，并且企图发动国际市场的争夺战，进而建立它的经济支配圈。目前，这种对外扩张的野心正像火一般地燃烧着。
    报告强调，日本垄断资本面临生产规模扩大和国内市场狭窄的矛盾，最近的经济恐慌更使这种矛盾尖锐化，因此，垄断资本企图对外扩张。但是，在社会主义体系进步和发展以及亚洲情况根本改变的今天，日本垄断资本无力单独进行对外扩张，同时，它们发展帝国主义的军事力量和军事产业的企图，也受到日本人民的强有力的抵抗。这就是日本垄断资本一方面抱着复活帝国主义和推行军国主义的野心，但另一方面又不能不利用对美从属关系的状态，这也是日本垄断资本出卖民族利益的卖国的特点。垄断资本委身于美国的冒险政策，企图取得美国援助，重建日本的军国主义，抵制发展中的社会主义阵营和民族解放运动，重新在亚洲进行帝国主义的侵略。日本垄断资本的侵略性正和美帝国主义的侵略性结合起来，形成对亚洲和平的重大危险。
    报告指出，日本经济从去年7月逐渐进入恐慌状态，日本正面临着严重的经济困难，因此，反动势力同民主力量的战斗即将达到重大阶段。
    报告指出，第二届岸信介内阁的主要的反动政策是：用执行美国的战争政策和推行日本核武装来换取美援，实现日本垄断资本所渴望的所谓东南亚开发；对中国公然采取敌对态度，事实上造成了中日关系的断绝状态，如果饶恕岸信介内阁这种态度，将给日本人民带来巨大损害；为了确立军国主义体制，岸信介内阁正在进行剥夺战后日本人民争取到的一些民主制度和权利，阻止民主力量的发展。
    报告指出，岸信介内阁的出现说明走向军国主义的垄断资本及反动势力同向民主主义方向前进的工人阶级及人民的斗争达到新的重要阶段。
    报告指出，岸信介内阁复活军国主义的政策必将遭到世界和亚洲人民以及日本人民的强
  烈反对。报告指出，今天的日本人民已经不是战前的日本人民，他们的斗争力量正在增强和发展。
  （二）日本共产党和日本工人阶级当前的各项任务
    报告的第二部分在谈到日共和日本工人阶级当前的任务时首先指出，自从第二届岸信介内阁成立以来，日本人民已经感到进行核武装与政治法西斯化的危险，越来越多的人民正在寻找有效的斗争方法和道路。
    报告说，日共针对美帝国主义和岸信介内阁以及自由民主党的统治和政策，必须向要求和平、独立、民主和提高生活水平的一切人民指明他们应走的道路，并且要把这些人民的力量团结起来，构成反对屈从美国与复活军国主义的力量。这是作为工人阶级先锋队的日共当前的基本任务。
    报告说，日本共产党当前的任务共分为十一项：
    一、要把各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科会议上通过的两项宣言作为日共的行动指南，同时使两个宣言的思想彻底深入到全体人民，并且团结全体人民为推进和平事业而奋斗。我们应该站在这一基础上反对帝国主义者的一切侵略战争计划，如果它们胆敢发动战争，无论何时、何地，为了阻止侵略，我们必须及时组织群众行动起来，站在最前列坚决展开斗争。这是日共作为国际共产主义运动的一个成员和根据无产阶级国际主义精神应该执行的崇高的任务。因此，日共在领导维护和平的斗争中必须坚持国际主义的立场，在加强国际合作和团结之下进行斗争。没有全世界和平拥护者的国际团结与合作，是不能阻止战争发生的危险和维护世界和平的。
    二、反对核武装日本、反对日本协助美国进行原子战争准备、反对复活日本军国主义的岸信介内阁与自由民主党的政策，并且主张把日本政府目前的政策改变成为维护世界与亚洲和平，同所有的国家建立和平、友好和平等关系的和平政策。在这项斗争中有四点目标：（1）争取立即无条件停止试验核武器，进而实现全面禁止核武器的制造和使用，阻止原子战争的危险；（2）为了阻止日本变成原子战争基地的计划，不仅要反对向日本运进核武器、阻止“自卫队”的核武装、促使岸信介政府宣布日本为无核武装的国家，并且要为撤销在日本的一切美军基地而展开斗争；（3）反对军事同盟政策和粉碎岸信介勾结李承晚和蒋介石建立“东北亚军事同盟”的阴谋，确立包括苏联、中国等在内的亚洲、太平洋地区集体安全体制；（4）反对敌视社会主义国家的政策，要求缔结日苏和约，恢复同中国、朝鲜、越南的邦交，按照和平五项原则同亚、非各国建立友好关系。报告同时指出，要把维护和平的运动发展成为反对日本政府企图复活军国主义的斗争。
    三、展开强大的国民运动，对岸信介内阁加以集中攻击，反对岸信介内阁和自由民主党敌视中国和协助美帝国主义和台湾蒋介石集团对中国发动战争的准备的政策。这项斗争有两点目标：（1）促使岸信介内阁改变敌视中国的政策；（2）废除所谓“日蒋条约”，争取恢复日中正常邦交。
    四、反对岸信介内阁和自由民主党巩固屈从美国的“旧金山体系”和复活军国主义的企图，展开打破“旧金山体系”，恢复日本的和平与独立的斗争。这项斗争要作到：撤销日美
  “安全条约”和“行政协定”，修改日美和约，争取冲绳、小笠原群岛无条件归还给日本，实现从日本撤出一切美军与撤销美军基地。
    五、展开反对建立军国主义政治体制和阻止修改和平宪法的斗争，维护日本人民的民主权利和民主教育，争取政治的彻底民主化。在这项斗争中有三点目标：（1）阻止实施“小选举区”制度和修改宪法，争取废除一切限制人民的民主权利的法律和法令，把现行选举制度改为比例代表制的民主选举制度。（2）反对镇压进步党派和工会以及民主运动的一切措施，撤销警察政治和思想警察制度，维护政治活动与工会运动的自由。（3）阻止加在教员身上的“勤务评定”制度，维护民主教育。报告指出，维护民主的斗争现在面临着严重局面，日本人民在战后争得的各种民主制度和权利日益受到摧残，并且有遭到彻底破坏的危险。
    六、反对为了保障垄断资本的超额利润而牺牲劳动人民的利益来摆脱经济恐慌的政策，争取提高工人阶级和劳动人民的生活水平以及经济的和平发展。
    七、日共当前最大的任务是促进全体工人阶级的团结与统一，巩固工农联盟，并在这个基础上建立民族民主统一战线，以团结一切劳动人民与进步力量。建立与发展民族民主统一战线。在目前的重要课题有五：（1）组织与发展群众的统一行动。（2）加强党与群众团体的关系，支援群众团体的运动与组织的发展，培养它们变成统一战线的劲旅。（3）提高人民统一战线的领导者工人阶级的觉悟，使它们成长为真正的领导阶级。（4）统一战线必须建立在工农联盟的基础上，只有党深入群众、在群众与农民里面扩大党的影响，才能建立工农联盟。（5）建立共产党同社会党的合作关系。
    八、在建立统一战线和建立民主政府的斗争中，国会活动和选举斗争越来越重要起来，我们必须总结过去的经验，从今天起积极进行在明年举行的地方选举和参议员选举的准备工作。
    九、日共特别重视教育问题的意义，并且反对岸信介内阁强迫推行反动的“勤务评定”制度。日共要以全力站在拥护民主教育斗争的最前列。
    十、日共重视工人阶级和人民对垄断资本和反动势力展开斗争时的思想斗争。
    十一、日共同各国共产党、工人党一道负有消灭压迫和剥削的旧世界、建立没有剥削的自由和平的新世界的伟大历史任务。日共支持社会主义阵营，支持世界社会主义体制的发展。日共还支持为了和平与民族独立，为了民主与社会进步而进行斗争的一切国家、政党、团体和个人以及有关的各种运动。日共要尊重无产阶级国际主义的原则，加强同各国兄弟党之间的相互信任，并且支持兄弟党的斗争。
    报告还提出了日本共产党为了推动日本各阶层人民的斗争的当前活动方针。
  （三）关于党的问题
    报告的第三部分谈到了关于党的问题，总结了自从第六次党代表大会以来的党的成就和缺点，并且提到了今后党的建设方针。
    报告同时强调，日共必须同修正主义进行彻底的斗争。
