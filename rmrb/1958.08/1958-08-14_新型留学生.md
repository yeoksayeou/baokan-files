A Small Scene in the Great Leap Forward

    New Type of Student
    On the evening of July 12th, Feng Guoqing, the cadre stationed at the Qianjin No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuma Township, Langzhong County, Sichuan Province, received a notice from the county Party committee, ordering him to rush back to the county town overnight to accept an urgent task. When he arrived in the county, the responsible comrade of the county Party committee smiled and said to him: "The county Party committee has decided at a meeting to send you to study abroad, to be a student abroad." Feng Guoqing was puzzled for a moment and asked: "What study abroad? Where to study abroad?" The reply was: "Go to Nanbu County to learn about late rice field management, and go to Xichong County to learn about sweet potato planting experience. The time is three to five days."
    Early in the morning on July 13th, Feng Guoqing took a bus to Nanbu County. He first talked with the responsible comrade of the CPC County Committee and learned that a prominent experience in late rice field management in this county was planting experimental fields. This county wants this year's late rice to exceed early rice, and to achieve an average yield of 1,000 catties per mu. How to guarantee it? Their approach is: all Party members, Youth League members, and cooperative cadres in the county plant late rice experimental fields. In this way, it is guaranteed that this year's late rice yield can exceed early rice. He also learned that Nanbu County has outstanding methods for running indigenous pesticide factories. They take advantage of the vigorous growth of weeds during the hot season, collect many poisonous weeds, such as sour honey grass, stinking peony, wild cotton, etc., to make quaternary mixtures and 611 mixtures to treat rice paddies for rice borers. Then he rushed to Jianxing District and learned that the propaganda and mobilization work of various townships and cooperatives in this district has a characteristic, that is, using various methods to boost the enthusiasm of the masses, such as command platforms, recruitment lists, mirror stands, and leaping forward mobilization platforms. So he wrote the three points he had learned into a written report overnight and sent it to the CPC Langzhong County Committee.
    On the 15th, Feng Guoqing arrived in Xichong County. At this time, the CPC Xichong County Committee was holding a sweet potato conference. He learned that the county also had very good methods based on the first, second, and third categories of sweet potato seedlings, respectively, such as applying potash fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, lifting vines, thinning branches, draining water to prevent waterlogging, and filling ditches in alternating rows.
    On the morning of the 16th, Feng Guoqing came to visit and study at Heming No. 1 Cooperative of Jinxin Township, one of the key cooperatives of the CPC Xichong County Committee, to see the growth of sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes in this cooperative all grew vines as thick as fingers and leaves as large as palms. The entire cooperative did not have a single mu of third-class seedlings. He carefully recorded their experience and measures in a small notebook, ready to report to the county Party committee in person after returning to the county.

    新型留学生
    7月12日晚上，四川阆中县五马乡前进第一农业生产合作社驻社干部冯国清接到县委通知，要他连夜赶回县城，接受紧急任务。他赶到县里，县委负责同志笑着对他说：“县委开会研究决定，派你去留学，当留学生。”冯国清一时摸不清头脑，便问：“什么留学？到哪里去留学？”回答说：“到南部县去学习晚稻田间管理，到西充县去学习红苕栽种经验，时间是三天到五天。”
    7月13日一早，冯国清乘车来到了南部县。他先到中共县委会同负责同志谈了一下，了解到这个县晚稻田间管理的一条突出经验是种试验田。这个县今年的晚稻要超过早稻，要平均亩产千斤，用什么来保证呢？他们采取的办法是：全县全体党员、团员、社干部都种晚稻试验田。这样一来，就保证了今年晚稻产量能够超过早稻。他又了解到南部县办土制农药厂有突出的好办法。他们趁伏天草苗争长的时候，采来许多毒草，如酸密草、臭牡丹、野棉花等等制成四合剂、六一合剂，为稻田治螟。接着他又赶到建兴区，了解到这个区各乡社的宣传鼓动工作有一个特点，就是利用多种多样的方式，鼓足群众干劲，如点将台、招贤榜、明镜台、跃进鼓动台等等。于是他连夜把学到的这三点写成了书面汇报，发给了中共阆中县委员会。
    15日，冯国清来到了西充县。这时中共西充县委员会正在召开红苕会议。他了解到这个县根据一、二、三类苕苗情况，分别采取追施钾肥、磷肥、提藤、疏枝、排水防涝、隔行填沟等办法也很好。
    16日早晨，冯国清来到了中共西充县委的重点社之一——晋新乡鹤鸣一社去参观学习，看红苕的生长情况。这个社的红苕，亩亩长得藤粗如指，叶大如掌，全社无一亩三类苗。便又把他们的经验、措施密密地记在小笔记本上，准备回县后当面向县委报告。
