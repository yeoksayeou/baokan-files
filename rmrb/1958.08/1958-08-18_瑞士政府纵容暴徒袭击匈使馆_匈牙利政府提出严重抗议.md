Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 17th - It was announced here today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic has issued a protest statement regarding the armed attack on the Hungarian Embassy in Switzerland on August 16th by two Hungarian counter-revolutionary fugitive elements.

The statement points out that the provocative attack against the Hungarian People's Republic, plotted and incited by imperialist forces, aims to divert world public opinion from the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East, and to artificially stir up another wave of opposition against Hungary.

The protest statement was presented by Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Sebes to the Swiss Minister to Budapest.

The statement said that the Swiss government, in violation of the principle of neutrality and disregarding repeated protests from the Hungarian People's Republic government, allows anti-Hungarian people and organizations opposed to the Hungarian government to exist within Swiss territory, and permits the Swiss press to carry out inflammatory anti-Hungarian propaganda. The statement said that the Swiss government should bear full responsibility for the consequences of this policy.

　　瑞士政府纵容暴徒袭击匈使馆
　　匈牙利政府提出严重抗议
    新华社布达佩斯17日电　今天这里公布了匈牙利人民共和国外交部就两名匈牙利反革命逃亡分子在8月16日武装袭击匈牙利驻瑞士公使馆一事发表的抗议声明。
    声明指出，由帝国主义势力策划和煽动的反对匈牙利人民共和国的挑衅攻击的目的在于转移世界舆论对美英侵略中近东的注意，和再一次人为地煽起反对匈牙利的浪潮。
    这个抗议声明是由匈牙利外交部副部长谢贝什向瑞士驻布达佩斯公使提出的。
    声明说，瑞士政府违背中立原则，并且无视匈牙利人民共和国政府的一再抗议，容许反匈牙利人民和匈牙利政府的组织在瑞士境内存在，容许瑞士报刊进行煽动性的反匈宣传。声明说，瑞士政府应对这种政策的后果负全部责任。
