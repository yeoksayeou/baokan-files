　　Master Worker Wang, Who Cares About Steel
　　Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Peng Zongtian
　　As soon as work started, many people went to carry oxygen, because when many angle steels were hot-sawed, the angle edges on both sides spread open, and oxygen had to be used to cut off all the deformed parts. As soon as Master Worker Wang Zhengyi heard this, he felt anxious. Hundreds of angle steels, with a section cut off each end, how much valuable steel would be wasted! Could such a thing happen in the Great Leap Forward? What's more difficult is that the oxygen supply is currently very tight. "Is it possible not to cut?" Master Worker Wang asked himself again and again. Finally, he firmly answered himself: "Definitely don't cut!" Because angle steel is low-carbon steel and can be cold-worked. He had done a lot of this work himself. So Master Worker Wang went to contact the inspection worker. On the one hand, he personally tested it. He lifted the sledgehammer and hit it a few times, and it quickly turned back to normal. Master Worker Wang put down the hammer, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and asked with a smile: "How is it?"
　　Everyone looked and it was exactly the same as a normal angle steel. But the inspector shook his head. He was afraid of problems and couldn't take responsibility, because it was the previous shift that made the judgment, and they had already started cutting some. Despite Master Worker Wang's repeated explanations of the benefits of not cutting, the other party stubbornly shook his head. Master Worker Wang thought: "This kid is timid, but I must stick to the principle." So he ran to Supervisor Song of the Supervision Station at more than two o'clock in the morning to solve the problem. That night everyone's enthusiasm was particularly high, and Comrade Mo Zhongqian also suggested using clamps to move, further improving work efficiency. This shift they organized a total of more than three hundred pieces.
　　One day, the previous shift handed over fifty-four heavy rails, inspected for re-sawing. When Master Worker Wang Zhengyi saw that so many steel rails had to be sawn into short sections of one meter or half a meter, he felt sorry for them. After re-sawing, the ends were not quenched, and they would change from first-class products to second-class products, selling for more than one hundred yuan less per ton. From the time the iron ore was mined by the mine to the time it was rolled into steel, how much effort and labor had the comrades put in! How could the comrades' labor be wasted like this? He secretly clenched his fist and firmly said: "We must find a way to save it!"
　　Master Worker Wang, with an anxious mood, examined the shortcomings of these steel rails, like a doctor diagnosing a disease. At this time, inspector Xu Zehe came. When Master Worker Wang saw him, he was a little angry and said: "You're taking good care of your easy job! How many days will it take us to saw so many steel rails? What about the task of delivering them to the warehouse?" Xu Zehe said: "This is done according to regulations! Do you think we want to do this?" Master Worker Wang immediately retorted: "What regulations? You come and see, are these problems completely incurable?" He pulled the inspector, pointing out the shortcomings and explaining and studying them. Most of the steel rails had some scratches on the ends, but the depth was not large. Master Worker Wang asked: "Doesn't the inspection standard stipulate that as long as the area and depth of the scratches do not exceed a certain proportion, we can process and file these steel rails without re-sawing, right?" Xu Zehe thought carefully and finally nodded. So Master Worker Wang personally tried processing. After a steel rail was hammered and filed by him, it completely met the specifications when inspected again. His success was immediately supported by the leadership, and the foreman immediately mobilized the comrades to join the intense battle. That day, this batch of steel rails was completely organized, saving a huge loss.

　　心疼钢材的王师傅
　　重庆钢铁公司　彭宗田
    一上班就有很多人去抬氧气，因为许多角钢在热锯的时候，把两边的角边张开了，要用氧气来割掉所有变形的部分。王正义老师傅一听到心里就着急，几百根角钢每根的两端都割这么一段，要浪费多少宝贵的钢材啊！这样的事情能出在大跃进中吗？更困难的是目前氧气供应非常紧张。“是不是可以不割呢？”王师傅再三地向自己发问。最后自己坚决地回答道：“一定不要割！”因为角钢是低炭钢，可以进行冷加工，他自己就做过多少这种生活。于是王师傅去找检验工联系。一面自己亲自试验，他举起大鎯头几边一打，很快就打转来了。王师傅放下鎯头，在额上抹一把汗，笑着问：“怎样？”
    大家一看和正常的角钢一模一样。可是检验工却摇摇头，他怕出了问题负不起责任，因为那是上一班判定的，而且已经开始割了一部分。尽管王师傅再三讲清不割的好处，但对方仍然顽固地摇着头。王师傅想：“这小子胆小，但我必须坚持原则”。于是他深夜两点多钟，仍然跑去找监督站宋站长，才把问题解决了。当晚大家的劲头也特别大，莫忠钱同志又建议用卡子搬，进一步提高了工作效率。这一班他们共整理了三百多条。
    又一天，上一班交下来五十四根重轨，检验为改锯。王正义老师傅一看要把这样多的钢轨锯成一公尺、半公尺的短节，就心疼起来。改锯以后，端部都没有淬火，就要由一级品变为二级品，每吨又要少卖一百多元。由矿山把铁矿开采出来到轧成钢材，经过了多少同志的心血和劳动啊！怎能叫同志们的劳动就这样浪费掉呢？他暗自把拳头一击，坚决地说：“必须想法挽救！”
    王师傅带着焦急的心情，察看着这些钢轨的缺点，像医生诊病似的。这时检验工徐泽合来了，王师傅看到他就有点生气，说道：“你照顾的好差事啊！这样多钢轨要我们锯多少天呢？交库的任务拿来怎么办？”徐泽合说：“这是按规定办事呀！难道我们愿意这样办吗？”王师傅马上反驳他说：“什么规定？你来看这些毛病是不是完全不能医治呢？”他拉着检验工，一面指着那些缺点，一面解释着，研究着。大部分钢轨是端部有些刮伤，但深度量不大，王师傅问道：“检验标准上不是规定了只要刮伤的面积和深度不超过一定的比例就行么！我们是不是可以把这些钢轨加加工锉一下，不必改锯呢？”徐泽合仔细想了想，终于点了点头。于是王师傅就亲自动手试行加工。经过他鎯头敲过，锉刀锉过的一根钢轨，再度检验时，完全合符规格了。他的这个成功，马上得到领导的支持，工长马上发动同志们投入紧张的战斗。当天就把这一批钢轨全部整理了出来，挽救了这笔巨大的损失。
