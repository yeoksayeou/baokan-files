　　Is it really "impossible to prevent?"
    On August 1st, we took train No. 136 from Weixian Station in Shandong Province to Xuzhou, and then transferred to express train No. 43 to Luoyang. Our luggage was checked through the station. On August 5th, when we went to Luoyang Station to pick up our luggage, we found it was all soaked with rain. We complained to a comrade in the luggage office, and he replied, "This is a natural disaster, there's no way to prevent it." When we brought the luggage back and opened it, we found that the bedding, clothes and books inside were all wet, and some had already become moldy.
    We believe that being rained on is not an "impossible to prevent" natural disaster. This is simply an accident caused by the relevant train personnel not taking responsibility for the luggage checked by passengers. We hope they will investigate and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

### 真的“无法防止”吗？

　　真的“无法防止”吗？
    8月1日，我们由山东省潍县车站乘一三六次客车到徐州，换乘四三次快车去洛阳。行李是交车站托运的。8月5日，我们到洛阳车站取行李时，一看全被雨水淋湿了。我们向行李托运室的一位同志提意见，他回答说：“这是自然灾害，没有办法防止。”等我们把行李拉回来打开一看，里面装的被褥、衣服和书籍全都湿了，有的已经发了霉。
    我们认为，淋雨并不是什么无法防止的自然灾害。这只是有关列车对旅客托运的行李不负责任所造成的事故。我们希望他们进行检查，防止再发生类似的事情。
