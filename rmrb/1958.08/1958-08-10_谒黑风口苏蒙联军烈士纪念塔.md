Visiting the Monument to the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Martyrs at Black Wind Pass
Xiao San

	Driving to Wolf Den Gulch,
	Mourning the bloodshed of that year.
	The fighting friendship solidified for long.
	Before the heroes' tower, I bow my head.
	Speaking of Wolf Den Gulch – Black Wind Pass,
	Hard to forget the old grudges and deep hatred.
	I originally did not want to dwell on old hatreds,
	But the likes of Nobusuke Kishi
	Shouldn't they be ashamed?!
	The terrain at Wolf Den Gulch is treacherous,
	The Japanese bandits developed it for over ten years.
	Trenches winding for six hundred li,
	Two hundred pillboxes in a large area.
	More than ten thousand civilians toiled,
	Hunger and cold, full of resentment.
	Whips fell like rain,
	Bayonets showed no mercy,
	Frozen to death, beaten to death –
	Who knows how many died each day!
	The Anguli Nuoer massacre: (Note 1)
	Mass executions without blinking an eye.
	To maintain military secrecy,
	Technical workers died three thousand at a time!
	Raping, burning, and killing for more than ten years,
	The people's suffering is endless.
	Hoping for flowers to bloom, hoping for the moon to be full,
	Hoping for the autumn of 1945.
	Two good days in August, (Note 2)
	The Soviet Union and Mongolia declared war on Japan together.
	A gust of wind blew at Black Wind Pass,
	Bringing the Allied mechanized divisions.
	During the Ghost Festival, the clouds were low, the moon was dark, and the night was hazy,
	The Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces charged fiercely in the rain.
	The Japanese bandits' dozens of counterattacks were useless,
	More than two hundred enemies died,
	More than six hundred enemies surrendered.
	The people then sang:
	"It's good to fight wolves in Wolf Den Gulch,
	Beating the devils until they cry for their mothers.
	The Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces are truly mighty,
	One strike, and the devils surrender.
	The Eighth Route Army cavalry guerrillas,
	Cooperated in a beautiful battle.
	With the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party,
	The Chinese people will surely be liberated."
	From then on, the northern frontier saw the light of day again.
	Internationalism is seen here in its substance.
	Sixty brothers shed their last drop of blood
	(Six from Mongolia, fifty-four from the Soviet Union),
	Sixty warriors who defended peace!
	Imperialists and militarists, look:
	Behind sixty people today there are a billion people.
	A billion people with one heart,
	Standing in one camp.
	If you harbor eternal hostility towards us,
	Or want to come and die again,
	Then Wolf Den Gulch is
	Your recent example!
	The memorial tower soars into the blue sky.
	Sixty golden names will be passed down forever.
	Every year during Qingming, villagers come in droves to sweep the tombs.
	Today we piously dedicate a poem.

(Note 1) That is, the current site of the Xiuhailiutu Reservoir.
(Note 2) On August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan,
August 10, the Mongolian People's Republic declared war on Japan. (Attached picture)

    谒黑风口苏蒙联军烈士纪念塔
    萧三
    驱车来到狼窝沟，
    悼念当年热血流。
    战斗友谊凝结久。
    英雄塔下我低头。
    提起狼窝沟——黑风口，
    难忘宿恨与深仇。
    我本不欲念旧仇，
    但是岸信介之流
    难道不害羞？！
    狼窝沟上地形险，
    日寇经营上十年。
    壕沟蜿蜒六百里，
    二百碉堡一大片。
    万多民伕作苦工，
    饥寒交迫愤满胸。
    皮鞭如雨落，
    刺刀不留情，
    冻死打死——
    每天不知多少人！
    安固里淖出惨案：（注一）
    集体屠杀不眨眼。
    为了军事守秘密，
    技术工人一次死三千！
    奸淫烧杀十多年，
    人民的苦痛说不完。
    盼花开，盼月圆，
    盼到了1945年的秋天。
    八月里两个好日子，（注二）
    苏、蒙向日本齐宣战。
    黑风口一阵风刮起，
    吹来了联军机械化师团。
    中元时节，云低月黑夜朦胧，
    苏蒙联军冒雨猛冲锋。
    日寇几十次反攻都无用，
    二百多敌人命归阴，
    六百多敌人俯首都就擒。
    人民于是唱：
    “狼窝沟里好打狼，
    打得鬼子只叫娘。
    苏蒙联军真威武，
    一打，鬼子就投降。
    八路骑兵游击队，
    配合打了漂亮仗。
    有了八路军和共产党，
    中国人民定能得解放。”
    从此塞北重新见天日。
    国际主义于此见实质。
    六十名兄弟流尽最后一滴血
    （蒙古有六人，苏联五十四），
    六十名保卫和平的战士！
    帝国主义者和军国主义者看吧：
    六十人后面今天有十亿人。
    十亿个人一条心，
    站在一个阵营。
    你如果对我们永怀敌意，
    或者想再来送死，
    那么，狼窝沟就是
    你们不久前的例子！
    纪念塔高耸入蓝天。
    六十个金字姓名万古传。
    年年清明村民络绎来扫墓。
    今年此日我们虔诚献诗篇。
    （注一）即现在修海流图水库处。
    （注二）1945年8月8日苏联向日本宣战，
      8月10日蒙古人民共和国向日本宣战。（附图片）
