Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner
Zhang Yinlin
    The Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner (formerly Morin Dawa Banner) is located on the southern slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the west bank of the Nenjiang River in the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It is named after Morin Dawa (Daur for horse-shaped mountain range) within its borders.

    This is the area with the largest concentration of Daur people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The total population is 63,944, of which 14,929 are Daur, accounting for 23.34% of the total population, 46,024 are Han Chinese, and there are also 3,041 people of other ethnic groups such as Ewenki, Mongolian, Manchu, Hui, Korean, and Oroqen. Among the twenty-four gacha (townships) in the banner, there are nine pure Daur gacha and two Ewenki gacha. The People's Committee of the Autonomous Banner is located in the town of Nierji.

    The area of the autonomous banner reaches 11,943 square kilometers. The southern part has a large plain with fertile land. The banner is rich in crops such as corn, sorghum, wheat, soybeans, rice, and potatoes. There are natural pastures with lush grass and water within the banner, with a total of more than 22,200 cattle, horses, and other livestock, an increase of one-third compared to 1947. The northern part is a mountainous area rich in resources, with more than ten kinds of trees such as oak, birch, and elm, and more than a hundred kinds of wild medicinal materials such as astragalus, red peony root, and bupleurum. There are many kinds of wild animals such as otters, lynx, foxes, squirrels, roe deer, and bears. It also contains rich deposits of placer gold, mica, iron, coal, fluorite and other minerals.

    The Daur people are hardworking and brave, but in the past, under reactionary rule, they suffered hardships, production was backward, and life was very poor. Since liberation in 1945, the people have become the masters of this beautiful land. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Daur people have developed rapidly in recent years. Now, a considerable number of Daur representatives are in the People's Congresses at all levels from the banner to the gacha. In recent years, a large number of ethnic minority cadres have been trained and promoted. Among the 1,018 cadres in the banner, Daur cadres and other ethnic minority cadres account for more than one-third. In the banner-level Party and government organs and people's organizations, Daur and other ethnic minority cadres account for 45%. In the Party and government leading organs, mass organizations, and enterprises of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Hulunbuir League, there are also many leading cadres at the banner, county, and prefectural committee levels who are Daur.

    The Daur people here migrated from Heilongjiang more than 300 years ago, originally mainly engaged in hunting and nomadic life, and later in transporting wood, gradually turning to agricultural production. In 1956, 96.7% of farmers of all ethnic groups in the banner had joined agricultural cooperatives. Before liberation, there were only three dilapidated small factories in this banner. After liberation, new industries such as agricultural tool repair, power generation, leather, timber, and paper making have been built. In the past six months, another 1,393 small factories have been established. Ninety-seven percent of school-age children in the banner have been enrolled in school. In the past, the Daur people were threatened by more than a dozen diseases such as measles, smallpox, and typhoid, and the population declined year by year. Now, health and medical institutions have increased twenty-fold compared with 1949, epidemic diseases have been basically controlled, and the population is on the rise.

　　莫力达瓦达斡尔自治旗
　　张荫林
    莫力达瓦达斡尔自治旗（原莫力达瓦旗），位于内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟的大兴安岭南麓和嫩江西岸。因境内有莫力达瓦（达斡尔语，意即马形的山岭）而得名。
    这是一个内蒙古自治区境内达斡尔族人口聚居最多的地方。总人口有六万三千九百四十四人，其中达斡尔族一万四千九百二十九人，占总人口的23.34％，汉族四万六千零二十四人，还有鄂温克、蒙古、满、回、朝鲜、鄂伦春等民族三千零四十一人。全旗二十四个嘎查
  （乡）中，有九个纯达斡尔族嘎查、两个鄂温克嘎查。自治旗人民委员会设在尼尔基镇。
    自治旗的面积达一万一千九百四十三平方公里。南部有较大的平原，土地肥沃。全旗盛产玉米、高粱、小麦、大豆、水稻、薯类等作物。旗内有水草丰美的天然牧场，共有牛马等牲畜二万二千二百多头，比1947年增长三分之一。北部是资源丰富的山区，丛生着柞、桦、榆等十多种树木和黄芪、赤勺、柴胡等百余种野生药材。有水獭、猞猁、狐狸、灰鼠、麅子、熊等多种野兽。还蕴藏着丰富的砂金、云母、铁、煤、萤石等矿产。
    达斡尔族是勤劳勇敢的，但在过去反动统治下面，受尽了艰辛苦难，生产落后，生活十分贫困。自从1945年解放以后，人民成为这块美丽土地的主人。在共产党领导下，几年来，达斡尔人的政治、经济、文化获得了飞跃的发展。现在，从旗到嘎查各级人民代表大会中都有相当数量的达斡尔族代表。几年来培养和提拔了大批民族干部，全旗一千零十八名干部中，达斡尔族干部和其他少数民族干部占三分之一以上。旗一级党、政机关和人民团体中，达斡尔族和其他少数民族干部占45％。在内蒙古自治区和呼伦贝尔盟的党政领导机关、群众团体和企业里，还有不少旗县和地委一级的领导干部是达斡尔族。
    这里的达斡尔族是在三百多年前从黑龙江迁来的，原以游猎、游牧为主，后来流送木材，逐渐转向农业生产。1956年全旗已有96.7％的各族农民加入农业社。解放前这个旗只有三个破烂的小工厂，解放后新建了农具修配、发电、皮革、木材、造纸等工业，近半年来，又办起一千三百九十三个小工厂。全旗97％的学龄儿童已经入学。达斡尔人过去长期受到麻疹、天花、伤寒等十几种疾病的威胁，人口逐年下降，现在卫生医疗机构比1949年增加了二十倍，流行病已基本得到控制，人口已在上升。
