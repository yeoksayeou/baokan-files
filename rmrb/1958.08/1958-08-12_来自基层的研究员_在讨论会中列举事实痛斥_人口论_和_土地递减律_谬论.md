    Grassroots Researchers
    Denounce Malthusianism and the Law of Diminishing Returns at Discussion Forum with Facts

    (Our Dispatch) A county party secretary and four agricultural cooperative directors have been hired as researchers by the Institute of Agricultural Economics of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. This was announced on the 9th at the National Agricultural Economics Science Discussion Conference.
    The five researchers are: Guo Zhen, Secretary of the Ningjin County Party Committee in Hebei Province; Ma Baoshan, Director of the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative in Ding County; Lian Yukun, Director of the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative in Jinghai County; Zhang Guishun, Director of the Shashiyu Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County; and Qin Zhenhua, Director of the Xiaobeiwang Liansheng Agricultural Cooperative in Yongnian County. This is the first group of scientific research personnel from grassroots units and agricultural cooperatives in social science research institutions.
    At the "National Agricultural Economics Science Discussion Conference" currently being held in Beijing, they conducted scientific discussions together with veteran scientists and professors. Using vivid facts from the great leap forward in local agricultural production, they refuted fallacies such as the so-called "population theory" and "law of diminishing returns" which serve the economic base of the bourgeoisie, leaving them utterly discredited.
    Guo Zhen, Secretary of the Ningjin County Party Committee, said in the discussion: Before liberation, Ningjin County had about 240,000 people and more than 900,000 mu of cultivated land, averaging 3.7 mu per person. After liberation, the population increased to more than 310,000, and the cultivated area did not change much, averaging less than 3 mu per person. What about production? Before liberation, the vast majority of peasants worked hard for a year, and in good years they could only live a life of "half grain and half vegetables." If they encountered a disaster, they had no choice but to leave their homes and flee. In that situation of hunger and cold, how could they develop production? How could peasants use backward and clumsy farm tools, as well as extremely crude farming methods, to unleash the power of the land? How could yields be increased? After liberation, agricultural production developed rapidly, with bumper harvests year after year. In recent years alone, in 1956, Ningjin County encountered unprecedented heavy rains, and more than 110,000 mu of land in the county were flooded, and no grain was harvested. However, due to the superiority of advanced cooperation, the total output of the county reached more than 150 million jin, with a yield of 290 jin per mu, an increase of 81% compared with the average yield of 160 jin per mu in the three years before cooperation. The total grain output increased by more than 70 million jin, while the population increased by about 6,880 people. Each person could get an average of more than 10,000 jin from the increased grain. In 1957, due to the vigorous strengthening of field management in the later stage, the result was a yield of 338 jin per mu and a total output of more than 180 million jin, an increase of 110% compared with the three years before cooperation, and an increase of more than 36 million jin compared with 1956. Based on an increase of 7,131 people, each person still received 5,185 jin of grain. In 1958, the target is a total output of 1.32 billion jin and a yield of 2,500 jin per mu, with an average of about 4,000 jin of grain per person. How many more people can be added this year? When you calculate it, I'm afraid that according to the rate of population increase, the increase in grain per person is not a few thousand, but tens of thousands of jin! Guo Zhen said that Ningjin County will realize mechanized irrigation and drainage in 1959, mechanized major farming operations, rubber tires on wheels, and ball bearings on other tools. It requires a grain yield of 5,000 jin per mu and a total output of 2.5 billion jin, and in 1960 it requires a yield of 10,000 jin per mu and a total output of 5 billion jin. By then, how much will the population grow each year? How much grain will each person get? Please calculate it, gentlemen! These facts are enough to show that human wisdom and strength are infinite, and the production potential of the land is endless. Those who believe that the population is excessive, who believe that people are only consumers, and who do not see that they are producers, do not realize that people are the basic force for developing production. The so-called "population theory" and "law of diminishing returns" of the bourgeois "Malthusians" and "scholars" are based on extremely absurd theories.

### 来自基层的研究员  在讨论会中列举事实痛斥“人口论”和“土地递减律”谬论

    来自基层的研究员
    在讨论会中列举事实痛斥“人口论”和“土地递减律”谬论
    本报讯　一位县委书记和四位农业社主任被中国农业科学院农业经济研究所聘请为研究员。这是9日在全国农业经济科学讨论会上宣布的。
    这五位研究员是：河北省的中共宁津县委会书记郭珍；定县韩家洼农业社主任马宝山；静海县富民农业社主任廉玉琨；遵化县沙石峪农业社主任张贵顺；永年县小北汪联胜农业社主任秦振华。在社会科学研究机关，这是第一批来自基层单位和农业社的科学研究人员。
    在北京正举行的“全国农业经济科学讨论会”上，他们和老科学家、老教授们共同进行了科学讨论。他们用当地农业生产大跃进中的生动事实，把那些为资产阶级经济基础服务的什么
  “人口论”、“土地报酬递减律”等谬论驳斥得体无完肤。
    中共宁津县委会书记郭珍在讨论中说：宁津县解放前约有二十四万多人，耕地九十多万亩，每人平均三点七亩；解放后几年人口增长到三十一万多，耕地面积变化不大，每人平均不到三亩。生产怎么样呢？解放前，广大农民辛勤劳动一年，好年景只能过“糠菜半年粮”的生活，如遇到灾荒，只好离乡背井，外出逃生。在那饥寒交迫的情景下，怎么能去发展生产呢？农民使用着落后的、笨拙的农具，以及极其粗糙的耕作方法，怎能发挥地力呢？产量怎能提高呢？解放以后，农业生产则得到了迅速的发展，连年丰收。仅以最近几年来看，1956年宁津县遇到了历年未有的大雨，全县十一万多亩土地被水淹，没有收什么粮食，但由于发挥了高级合作化的优越性，全县总产量达到一亿五千多万斤，亩产二百九十斤，比合作化前三年平均亩产一百六十斤增产81％。粮食总产量增加七千多万斤，而人口约增加六千八百八十多人，用增加的人口来分增加的粮食每人平均可分到一万多斤。1957年由于大力加强了田间后期管理工作，结果达到亩产三百三十八斤，总产达到一亿八千多万斤，比合作化前三年增长110％，比1956年增长三千六百多万斤，按增加七千一百三十一人计算，每人还分到五千一百八十五斤粮食。1958年要求总产一十三点二亿斤，亩产二千五百斤，每人平均粮食约可达四千斤，今年还能增加多少人呢？计算起来，恐怕按人口增加比例，每增加一人，粮食的增长不是几千，而是几万斤了吧！郭珍说，宁津县1959年要实现排灌机械化，耕作主要工序机械化，车轮胶轮化，其他工具滚珠轴承化，要求粮食亩产五千斤，总产二十五亿斤，1960年要求亩产一万斤。总产五十亿斤，到了那时，每年人口能增长多少？每人能分得多少粮食，请先生们算一算吧！这些事实足以说明，人的智慧和力量是无穷的，土地的生产潜力是无尽的。那些认为人口过剩了，认为人只是消费者，看不到是生产者，认识不到人是发展生产的基本力量。资产阶级“人口论”者和“土地报酬递减论”的“学者”们，他们的所谓“人口论”，“土地报酬递减”理论的根据是非常荒唐的。
