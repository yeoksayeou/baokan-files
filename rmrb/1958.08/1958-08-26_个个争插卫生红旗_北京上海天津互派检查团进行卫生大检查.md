Everyone Competes to Plant Sanitary Red Flags
Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin Send Inspection Teams to Conduct Large-Scale Sanitary Inspections

　　This newspaper reports that recently, on the streets and alleys of the capital, large banners and colored flags can be seen saying "This unit (household, street) has basically achieved 'Four No's' and 'Three Cleans,' welcome inspection," welcoming the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Shanghai and Tianjin inspection teams to Beijing for inspection. The inspection teams arrived in Beijing yesterday, and the week-long inspection will begin on the 26th.
    Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin are collaborative regions for health competitions. This time, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee on organizing a large-scale summer and autumn patriotic health campaign inspection and the spirit of the three-city friendship competition agreement on eliminating pests and promoting hygiene, the three cities organized this inspection in order to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and further promote the leap forward in the campaign to eliminate pests and promote hygiene.
    The Shanghai and Tianjin inspection teams will focus on inspecting the elimination of pests, the elimination of mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and environmental sanitation. The National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Shanghai and Tianjin inspection teams are mixed into two groups to conduct inspections separately. The method of inspection is to combine with the city-wide mass survey to investigate the density of eliminating rats and mosquitoes and flies, and the situation of eliminating sparrows and environmental cleanliness.
    Before the inspection teams came to Beijing, the city launched a summer and autumn sanitation blitz week centered on eliminating the four pests and doing the three cleans. The broad masses of the people are striving to plant red flags, and each unit and street is simultaneously conducting a blitz and carrying out mutual inspections, encouraging many advanced units to become more advanced and promoting backward units to catch up. Even government agencies, which have always been relatively backward, have proposed to welcome the inspection teams with practical actions and actively carry out the work of eliminating pests and promoting hygiene. According to statistics from Xicheng District alone, 71 of the 77 agencies in the district have planted red flags. During the blitz week, the city's sanitation work has been greatly improved.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 25th: The National Summer and Autumn Patriotic Health Inspection in Shanghai began today. The Beijing inspection team, led by Beijing Deputy Mayor Wang Kunlun, and the Tianjin inspection team, led by Tianjin Deputy Mayor Lou Ningxian, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, spent the whole day today listening to reports from the Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee.
    Starting on the 26th, the Beijing and Tianjin inspection teams will work with relevant parties in Shanghai to conduct detailed and in-depth inspections of factories, government agencies, schools, neighborhood offices, agricultural cooperatives, and animal byproduct industries in Shanghai's 18 districts and 3 counties for seven to ten days. The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Ministry of Health also sent representatives Man Yan and others yesterday to participate in the inspection.
    From December last year to the end of July this year, Shanghai experienced three stages of blitzes to eliminate the seven pests and repeated struggles; at the same time, it also basically managed the 324 kilometers of foul-smelling creeks that the old society left behind, which seriously affected environmental sanitation. The street cleaning system has been implemented in most areas of the city, and the cleanliness of streets and lanes throughout the city has been greatly improved. From January to June this year, the incidence of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in the city decreased by 13.5% compared with the same period last year.
    In the past few days, all districts and units in Shanghai have once again launched a city-wide upsurge in the movement to eliminate the seven pests and promote hygiene in order to welcome the national inspection.
    This newspaper, Tianjin, August 25th: Today, the Beijing and Shanghai health inspection teams began conducting health inspections in Tianjin.
    After two weeks of hard work in Tianjin's sanitation campaign, under the personal leadership of responsible party and government cadres at the municipal and district levels, the broad masses of people worked hard day and night, making the sanitation situation completely new. Today, the inspection team went deep into streets, schools, troops, government agencies, and the catering industry to conduct detailed inspections. The first inspection team, led by Yan Jingqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, inspected the mass catering cafeteria, Haiguangsi Street, and Anshan Road No. 1 Primary School in Heping District. The inspection team expressed satisfaction with the environmental sanitation of the mass catering cafeteria, which has only 72 employees and more than 10,000 customers per day on average, with no flies and a clean, sputum-free ground. The inspection team was very interested in the fume hood and customer hand washing facilities created by the cafeteria staff. On Haiguangsi Street, the inspection team inspected the second residential area of this street, which has a small area, a large population, and relatively poor environmental conditions. After fifteen days of hard work by the residents, this residential area eliminated household garbage bins, sewage buckets, and simple toilets in the courtyard, built public toilets, public garbage bins, and sewers at their own expense, and repaired the hutongs, greatly improving the sanitation situation. The residents' homes are also very clean.
    The third inspection team, led by Wang Shuzhuang, Deputy Director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, Ministry of Culture, and Wang Zengtao, Head of Chongwen District in Beijing, expressed satisfaction with the rotational duty system and the sanitation reward and evaluation system of the Tianjin Animal Products Company, as well as the sanitation of the office. However, the inspection team found that the basement of the company was messy and found two or three flies in the kitchen, and the inspection team also raised opinions.
    The other two inspection teams also inspected the sanitation conditions of streets, government agencies, troops, schools, and service industries in urban and rural areas and Hexi District today. Many units immediately made improvements after the inspection team pointed out the shortcomings in the sanitation campaign.

　　个个争插卫生红旗
    北京上海天津互派检查团进行卫生大检查
    本报讯　近日来，在首都的大街小巷都可以看到“本单位（户、街道）基本达到‘四无’、‘三洁’欢迎检查”的巨幅标语和彩旗，欢迎全国爱国卫生运动委员会和上海、天津两市参观检查团来京检查。参观检查团已于昨日来京，26日开始为时一周的参观检查。
    北京和上海、天津两市是卫生竞赛协作地区。这次三市根据中央爱国卫生运动委员会关于组织夏秋季爱国卫生运动大检查的指示和三市除四害讲卫生友谊竞赛协议书的精神，为了互相学习，交流经验，进一步促进除四害、讲卫生运动的跃进，组织了这次参观检查。
    上海、天津参观检查团以检查除四害、消灭蚊蝇孳生条件和环境卫生为主要内容。全国爱国卫生运动委员会、上海和天津的参观检查团混合分成两个组，分别进行检查。检查的方法是结合全市群众性的普查，调查消灭老鼠、蚊蝇的密度和消灭麻雀、环境清洁的情况。
    参观检查团来京前，北京全市开展了以消灭四害、作好三洁为中心的夏秋卫生突击周。广大群众都力争插上红旗，各单位、街道一边突击，一边展开相互检查，鼓舞了许多先进单位更先进，促进落后单位赶上来了。一向比较落后的机关也都提出以实际行动迎接检查团，积极开展除四害讲卫生的工作。仅西城区统计，全区七十七个机关有七十一个机关插上了红旗。在突击周内，使全市卫生工作大为改进。
    新华社上海25日电　全国夏秋季爱国卫生大检查上海市的检查已在今天开始。昨天到达上海的以北京市副市长王昆仑为首的北京参观检查团和以天津市副市长娄凝先为首的天津参观检查团今天整天听取了上海市爱国卫生运动委员会的汇报。
    从26日开始，北京、天津检查团将分别和上海有关方面一起在上海市十八个区和所属三县对工厂、机关、学校、街道办事处、农业合作社和禽兽副产品行业等单位进行七天到十天的细致和深入的检查。中央爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生部昨天也派来代表蔓焰等三人，准备一齐参加检查。
    从去年12月到今年7月底为止，上海经历了三个阶段的歼灭七害的突击和经常反复斗争；同时还把旧社会遗留下来的严重影响环境卫生的三百二十四公里臭水浜基本治理完毕。市区大部分地区实行了地段清扫制度，全市街道里弄清洁程度大为提高。今年1月到6月，全市的伤寒和副伤寒疾病发病率比去年同期降低了13.5％。
    这几天，上海各区、各单位为迎接全国大检查，又一次掀起了全市性的除七害、讲卫生运动高潮。
    本报天津25日电　今天，北京、上海两市的卫生检查团开始在天津进行卫生检查。
    天津市的卫生运动经过了两周的苦战，在市、各区党政负责干部亲自动手下，广大群众苦战几昼夜，使卫生面貌焕然一新。今天检查组深入到街道、学校、部队、机关以及饮食行业进行细致的检查以北京市卫生局局长严镜清为首的第一检查组，检查了和平区的群众饮食食堂、海光寺街和鞍山道第一小学。检查组对只有七十二个职工，平均每天有一万多顾客的群众饮食食堂没有苍蝇，地面干净没有痰迹的环境卫生表示满意。检查组对这个食堂职工创造的油烟罩、顾客洗手器卫生设备感到很大兴趣。在海光寺街，检查组检查了这个街面积小、人口多、环境条件比较差的第二居民区。这个居民区在居民苦战十五天以后，取消了户内垃圾箱、污水桶和院内简陋厕所，自费修建了公共厕所、公共垃圾箱和下水道，修整了胡同，使卫生面貌大为改善。居民住宅也收拾得非常整洁。
    以文化部文物局副局长王书庄和北京市崇文区区长王曾涛为首的第三检查组，检查天津市畜产公司时，对这个公司科室干部有轮流值日制度和卫生奖励评比制度以及办公室的卫生状况表示满意。但是检查组发现这个公司的地下室东西放得较乱，在厨房里发现了两三个苍蝇，检查组也提出了意见。
    其它的两个检查组在今天也分别检查了城乡区和河西区等街道、机关、部队、学校和服务性行业的卫生状况。许多单位在检查组指出卫生运动中的缺点后，都立即作了改进。
