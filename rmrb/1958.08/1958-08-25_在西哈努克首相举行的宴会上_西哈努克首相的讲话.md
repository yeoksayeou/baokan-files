Premier Sihanouk's Speech at the Banquet Held by Premier Sihanouk

Mr. Vice Chairman of the Republic, Mr. Premier, Your Excellencies, Gentlemen,

You have sacrificed this customary day of rest and have most kindly accepted the invitation of the Cambodian National Delegation.

I am greatly honored by this, and I ask you to accept my sincere thanks. I am especially deeply grateful to Vice Chairman Zhu De for attending this banquet and extend my welcome to him.

Tonight, I and our delegation are once again delighted to see a gathering of sincere friends who have shown us such deep affection during the past week. However, just as we are about to part with a most beloved friend, there is an inevitable sense of melancholy mixed with joy. For tomorrow we shall leave this hospitable Chinese land and the brotherly affectionate Chinese people.

During our visit, we have heard much and seen much, especially seen much; for, as Premier Zhou Enlai often says, "Seeing is believing." We fully agree with this opinion. We have seen. We are convinced that the progress of the New China is now catching up with the largest countries in the world.

We have visited your factories, your large and medium-sized industries, and we have seen your efforts in rural mechanization. We have visited your excellently cultivated fields, and we believe we can say once again that the changes in the face of your country at present can be said to be unique in world history.

We have also learned that these achievements have been achieved by the enthusiastic and joyful production of the people in both urban and rural areas with the policy of more, faster, and better. In short, these achievements, which some call the Chinese miracle, should be greatly respected because your efforts are truly for peace. The Chinese people and the Cambodian people, whose bravery in battle is well known, hate war, which gives us even more reason to unhesitatingly develop our friendship.

However, this friendship between our two countries has aroused and is arousing hostility towards Cambodia in some countries. We are insulted daily by a section of the foreign press, and every period of time, someone attempts to strangle our economy, and every week, someone spreads an atmosphere of terror of aggression, and recently someone has even lawlessly plundered a small piece of our territory.

These means tarnish their own personalities and cause great sacrifices to our people, but we have not changed and will never change our course of action because we are convinced that this course of action is in the interests of our motherland and the cause of maintaining peace. The Cambodian people are prepared to overcome all difficulties; threats will never force them to abandon neutrality and friendship with China.

I find it difficult to express how moved I am by the hospitality of the Chinese people. The smiling faces of the steelworkers of Anshan and Shenyang and the farmers of the cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin show their friendship and solidarity with our people. They do not know our people, but they have the same desire for peace and progress.

Furthermore, the talks we have had with the leaders of New China will be of great benefit to the future of the Cambodian people. A few hours ago, I had the honor of signing a joint statement with Premier Zhou Enlai, which definitively consolidates the foundation of our friendly relations and strengthens our solidarity in maintaining common ideals. We know that these ideals are the product of mutual understanding and harmony within the family of Asian and African countries. These ideals are the continuous pursuit of progress in construction to improve the welfare of our two peoples, maintain their freedom, and defend peace. As we are about to return home, we believe that during this visit, we and friendly China have taken another step forward in strengthening the relations between our two countries.

What has deeply touched us is that your country's Chairman himself, Premier Zhou Enlai, Marshal Chen Yi, Marshal He Long, as well as the organizations and various military and civilian units of the People's China, have given us meticulous care and respect.

We have reported to our people the grand reception we have received from you every day, and they are particularly excited and honored by these many undeniable expressions of your respect and support for them. On behalf of all the Cambodian people, I ask you to accept our warm wishes for the successful completion of your economic and social plans, especially for the successful completion of the "Great Leap Forward" in production, the initial and remarkable achievements of which we have already seen.

Please allow me to propose a toast to the friendship between Cambodia and China, to the strength of the People's Republic of China and the happiness of the Chinese people, to peace between all countries, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the health of Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China!

### 在西哈努克首相举行的宴会上  西哈努克首相的讲话

　　在西哈努克首相举行的宴会上
    西哈努克首相的讲话共和国副主席先生，总理先生，阁下，各位先生，
    你们牺牲了这个惯常休息的星期天，极其友好地接受了柬埔寨国家代表团的邀请。
    我为此感到十分荣幸，并且请你们接受我诚挚的感谢。我特别深切地感谢朱德副主席光临这个宴会，并且对他表示欢迎。
    我和我们的代表团今天晚上又一次高兴地看到一星期以来对我们表示了如此深厚情谊的诚挚的朋友们聚集在一起，但是，正像我们即将和一个最亲爱的朋友离别一样，高兴之中又不免有怅然之感。因为明天我们就要离开如此好客的中国国土和如此兄弟般地亲切的中国人民了。
    在我们访问期间，我们听了很多，看了很多，特别是看了很多；因为，正像周恩来总理先生时常说的：“百闻不如一见”。我们完全同意这个意见。我们看了。我们深信新中国现在的进展赶上了世界上最大的国家。
    我们访问了你们的工厂、你们的大型的和中型的工业，我们看到你们在农村机械化方面的努力。我们参观了你们耕作得极好的田地，我们认为可以再一次向你们说，目前你们国家的面貌的改变可以说是世界历史上绝无仅有的。
    我们也了解到，这些成就是全国城乡人民热情而愉快地用更多、更快、更好的方针进行生产而取得的。总之，有些人称之为中国的奇迹的这些成就，应该受到极大的尊重，因为你们的努力是真正地为了和平。中国人民和柬埔寨人民一样，他们作战的勇敢是尽人皆知的，但是他们憎恨战争，这使我们更有理由毫不迟疑地开展我们的友谊。
    然而，我们两国间的这种友谊已经引起而且正在引起某些国家对柬埔寨的敌视。我们每天都遭到一部分外国报刊的辱骂，每隔一段时期，就有人企图扼杀我们的经济，每一个星期都有人散布侵略的恐怖气氛，最近甚至有人无法无天地掠夺了我们的一小块领土。
    这些手段沾污了他们自己的人格，而且使我国人民遭到重大的牺牲，但是我们并没有因此改变并且永不会改变我们的行动方针，因为我们确信这个方针符合于我们祖国的利益和维护和平的事业。柬埔寨人民准备克服一切困难；威胁决不能迫使他们放弃中立和对中国的友谊。
    我难于表达出我是如何被中国人民的款待所感动，鞍山和沈阳的炼钢工人和北京和天津郊区合作社的农民的满面笑容，表现了他们对我国人民的友谊和团结。他们和我国人民并不相识，但是他们具有要求和平和进步的同样的愿望。
    此外，我们和新中国领导人所进行的会谈对柬埔寨人民的未来将极有裨益。几小时以前，我荣幸地同周恩来总理一起签订了一项联合声明，这项声明肯定地巩固了我们的友好关系的基础，加强了我们在维护共同理想中的团结，我们知道，这些理想是亚非各国大家庭中的相互了解和和谐的产物，这些理想是不断地追求建设事业的进展以增进我们两国人民的福利，维护他们的自由和保卫和平。在我们即将回国的时候，我们相信，这次访问期间我们和友好的中国一起，在加强我们两国间的关系方面又前进了一步。
    使我们深受感动的是，贵国主席本人，周恩来总理，陈毅元帅，贺龙元帅，以及人民中国的各机关团体和各个军民单位都给了我们无微不至的关怀和尊重。
    我们曾把每天受到你们隆重接待的情况报告给我国人民，他们都为这许多说明你们对他们的尊重和支援的无可置辩的表现感到特别的兴奋和光荣。我以全体柬埔寨人民的名义，请你们接受我们热烈的祝愿，祝你们的经济和社会计划完满实现，特别是祝我们已经看到其初步的可观成就的生产“大跃进”完满成功。
    请允许我，为柬埔寨和中国之间的友谊，为中华人民共和国的壮大和中国人民的幸福，为各国之间的和平，为毛泽东主席的健康，为周恩来总理和中华人民共和国政府其他领导人的健康而干杯！
