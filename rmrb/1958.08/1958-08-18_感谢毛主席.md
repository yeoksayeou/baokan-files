　　Thank Chairman Mao
　　I am seventy-six years old this year. When I was nineteen and my younger brother was sixteen, we worked as long-term laborers for landlords because of our difficult family life. One year, the Yellow River flooded, destroying the crops, and we had to flee the famine. At that time, I thought I was just unlucky, so I entered a Buddhist temple, ate vegetarian food, and did good deeds, hoping to become a deity. Later, when the Japanese devils invaded, life became increasingly difficult. After liberation, the government helped us with production, and we had food and clothing. This June, the agricultural cooperative decided that I should enjoy the Five Guarantees, living in a new house and eating new rice and white flour. Thinking back to the forty-eight years my brother and I spent eating vegetarian food and doing good deeds, the "Buddha" never made me a god. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I don't have to worry about food and clothing, as if I have become a god. How can I not thank the Communist Party?

　　感谢毛主席
    我今年七十六岁了，在我十九岁那年，我的弟弟十六岁，因家庭生活困难，兄弟两人给地主当长工。有一年黄河泛滥成灾，田苗冲毁，只得逃荒外流。那时还以为自己时运不好，便身入佛堂，吃斋行善，盼仙成神，到后来遭日本鬼子侵略，生活越来越困难。解放后政府帮助搞生产，有了吃穿，今年6月里，农业合作社决定我享受五保待遇，住着新房，吃的是新米白面。想起来我兄弟两人吃斋行善四十八年，“佛爷”没封我成神，现在毛主席领导下，我不愁吃穿，仿佛成神，怎能不感谢共产党呢？
