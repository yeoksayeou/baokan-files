Book Distribution Work Plants Red Flag

The great leap forward in book distribution work in Chang'an County raises a new question: That is, in the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and in the vigorous development of the technological and cultural revolutions, book distribution work should also make a great leap forward.

The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has promoted a great leap forward in culture. Now, the whole country is engaged in a large-scale technological and cultural revolution in rural areas. Farmers are in urgent need of scientific and technical knowledge. They demand to learn new knowledge and new experiences. In particular, thousands of farmers have shaken off the shackles of illiteracy and are eager to read. Within a month after Chang'an County's forty-four townships achieved great results in literacy and other work, a total of more than 867,000 books were distributed, while the total distribution in the first half of the year was only 100,000. This is a new task put forward to the book distribution work by the new situation.

However, some comrades in the book distribution departments have not fully recognized this new change, saying that farmers have a low level of culture, and book distribution work in rural areas can only be aimed at students and cadres, but not at the vast number of farmers. This is right-leaning conservative thinking in book distribution work. The staff of the Chang'an County Xinhua Bookstore branch, when studying the Party's general line for socialist construction, examined and criticized this right-leaning conservative thinking, and the face of book distribution work was renewed. This shows that book distribution work should adapt to the changes in the new situation and catch up.

Book distribution work should serve to promote production development and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. However, some book distribution workers only proceed from whether they can complete sales tasks and make money. They are very interested in distributing large-volume books in schools and agencies, but they are not very interested in distributing popular books to the vast rural areas, thinking that it is troublesome and difficult to complete the task, and forgetting the vast number of farmers in the rural areas. This is a remnant of bourgeois ideology. This erroneous thinking should be criticized. While the staff of the Chang'an County Xinhua Bookstore met the needs of the rural areas while focusing on serving cadres and students, thereby also promoting production. This is what book distribution staff should learn.

The experience of book distribution work in Chang'an County also shows that book work must make a leap forward by relying on the masses and taking the mass line. They changed the past method of sitting and waiting for the masses in the sales department, and went deep into the fields to investigate and understand the needs of the masses; they stepped out of the circle of only a few full-time cadres doing book distribution work, relying on commune cadres, teachers of people's schools, teachers of red-expert schools, and activists among the vast number of masses, so that book distribution work was carried out vigorously.

The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rise of the upsurge of the technological and cultural revolutions have provided favorable conditions for book distribution work and have also put forward arduous and glorious tasks for book distribution work. This is the case in Chang'an County, and it will inevitably be the case in the whole country. What book distribution workers in Chang'an County can do, book distribution workers all over the country should also be able to do.

### 图书发行工作插红旗

　　图书发行工作插红旗
　　吴敏
    长安县图书发行工作大跃进的事实，提出了一个新问题：这就是在工农业大跃进，在技术革命和文化革命蓬勃发展中，图书发行工作也应该大跃进。
    工农业生产的大跃进推动了文化大跃进。现在，全国农村都在大搞技术革命和文化革命。农民们迫切需要科学技术知识。他们要求学习新的知识、学习新的经验。特别是成千上万的农民摘掉了文盲帽子，迫切要求读书。长安全县四十四个乡扫盲和各项工作取得很大成果后的一个月内，共发行了八十六万七千多册图书，而上半年总共发行十万零几千册。这就是新的形势向图书发行工作提出的新任务。
    但是，一些图书发行部门的同志并没有充分地认识到这种新的变化，说什么农民文化水平低，农村的图书发行工作只能面向学生和干部，而不能面向广大农民。这是图书发行工作中的右倾保守思想。长安县新华书店支店的职工，在学习党的社会主义建设总路线时，检查和批判了这种右倾保守思想，图书发行工作的面貌就为之一新。这就说明，图书发行工作应该适应新形势的变化，迎头赶上。
    图书发行工作应当为促进生产发展，为多快好省建设社会主义服务。但是有些图书发行工作者只从能否完成销售任务、能否赚钱出发，对于在学校和机关里发行大部头书籍兴趣很大，而对于向广大农村发行通俗书籍不太感兴趣，认为既费事，又难完成任务，忘记了农村的广大农民。这是一种资产阶级的思想残余。这种错误思想应当批判。长安县新华书店的职工在图书发行工作面向干部和学生的同时，满足了农村需要，从而也促进了生产。这是图书发行工作人员应该学习的。
    长安县的图书发行工作经验，还说明了图书工作要跃进，就得依靠群众，走群众路线。他们改变了过去那种在门市部坐等群众的办法，深入田间、地头，深入调查了解群众需要；他们走出只是少数专职干部作图书发行工作的圈子，依靠社干部、民校教师、红专学校的教员以及广大群众中的积极分子，使图书发行工作蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    工农业生产大跃进，技术革命和文化革命高潮的兴起，给图书发行工作提供了有利条件，也对图书发行工作提出了繁重而光荣的任务。长安县如此，全国也势必如此。长安县图书发行工作者能够作到的，全国各地图书发行工作者也应当能够作到。
