    American Aggressors' Crimes Cannot be Concealed
    Direct Aggressors Falsely Claim to Eliminate "Indirect Aggression"
    Armed Occupiers Claim Foreign Broadcasts are a Threat
    TASS Points Out Dulles' Confused Logic of Reversing Black and White
    Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd. TASS, Moscow, August 1st. TASS observer Borisov writes: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a recent press conference that he was confident that a summit meeting would dispel the "fictitious claim" that the United States or Britain was aggressing against the Middle East. On the other hand, Dulles believes that the meeting will show that there is a "danger of indirect aggression" frequently condemned by the United Nations.
    If so, why has the United States stubbornly avoided convening a meeting of heads of government to discuss the situation in the region since the first day of the conflict in the Near and Middle East? The answer to this question can even be found in some influential American newspapers: It turns out that Washington would be in the position of the accused at this meeting because of its direct, and by no means indirect, aggression.
    When someone at the press conference asked Dulles how he intended to prove the existence of indirect aggression, he avoided answering the question. Indeed, what could he say? Could he repeat the old tune that the events in Lebanon and Jordan were the result of "external infiltration"? However, even Dulles could no longer repeat this lie after the two reports of the United Nations observer group sent to Lebanon, which the US delegation had voted in favor of, denied the claim that other countries had interfered in the country's internal affairs before the landing of American troops. Therefore, in order to defend the US and British aggression, he is now emphasizing another claim: that there is indirect aggression in the Near and Middle East in the form of "inciting civil war from the outside." Here, the Secretary of State has now inadvertently admitted that the events in Lebanon were a civil war, an internal struggle, before the intervention of the interventionist forces, and that any other country, as long as it considers the requirements of international law and the United Nations Charter, cannot and should not interfere. However, Mr. Dulles, who is keen to find reasons for the direct and shameless aggression of the United States and Britain, is trying to prove that the internal struggle in Lebanon and Jordan is the result of external instigation. It is a well-known and absurd trick that colonialists have for many years attempted to portray the irresistible world historical process of the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system as the result of external conspiracies. Even many American politicians have advised the White House not to close its eyes to the rise of Arab nationalism, and to consider the fact that the Arab people have forever and firmly embarked on the road of struggle for national independence. However, Mr. Dulles continues to stubbornly describe this struggle as the result of some kind of "indirect aggression," and even says that he wants to monitor a country's radio broadcasts to another country.
    The US Secretary of State fantasizes about convincing the world that the events in the Near and Middle East are not a direct and unprovoked aggression by the United States and Britain against the people of Lebanon and Jordan, but a mysterious and planned "indirect aggression." Not only that, but Dulles even wants to have this shockingly distorted and black-and-white reversal of current events recognized by the summit meeting. He shouted at the press conference, "We should make people face the fact that the political instability caused by indirect aggression has created a huge danger."
    Dulles even believes that recognizing this point should be a prerequisite for discussing all issues related to the political and economic stability of the Near East. He threatened that if this point is not recognized, then "peace will be truly threatened." In other words, the Secretary of State wants other countries to agree to expand the US and British aggression against the Arab East. This is the intention of Dulles' words at the press conference, but it runs counter to the unanimous desire of the people of all countries to immediately stop the US and British aggression against the Arab East and let the Arab people decide their own destiny.
    The aggressor is trying to obtain a license to act as the protector of the Arab people's resistance to aggression. This is also the intention of Dulles' rogue tactics. But no one with a sound mind can agree with his way of posing the question.

### 直接侵略者妄谈消除“间接侵略”  武装占领者却说外国广播是威胁  塔斯社指出杜勒斯黑白颠倒逻辑混乱

    美国侵略者的罪行欲盖弥彰
    直接侵略者妄谈消除“间接侵略”
    武装占领者却说外国广播是威胁
    塔斯社指出杜勒斯黑白颠倒逻辑混乱
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：塔斯社观察家波里索夫写道：美国国务卿杜勒斯在最近一次记者招待会上表示，他确信最高级会议将会打消那种认为美国或英国侵略中东的“虚构的说法”。另一方面，杜勒斯认为，会议将会表明那里存在着联合国所经常谴责的“间接侵略的危险”。
    既然如此，为什么美国从中近东发生冲突的第一天起就顽固地回避召开政府首脑会议来讨论这个地区的局势？这个问题的答案甚至可以在美国的某些有影响的报刊上找到：原来是，华盛顿在这次会议上将由于进行直接的、而绝不是间接的侵略而处在被告的地位。
    有人在记者招待会上问杜勒斯他打算怎样证明存在着间接侵略，他对这个问题避而不答。的确也是，他能有什么可说的呢？难道重弹黎巴嫩和约旦的事件是“外部渗入”的结果的老调吗？但是，在美国代表团曾经投票赞成的派到黎巴嫩去的联合国观察团的两次报告中都否定了在美军登陆前有其他国家干涉这个国家内政的论调以后，甚至杜勒斯也无法再来重复这种谎言了。因此，他为了辩护美英的侵略，现在又强调另一个说法：中近东存在着间接侵略，形式是“从外部挑起内战”。这里，国务卿现在自己已不知不觉地承认，黎巴嫩的事件在干涉军侵入这个国家以前是内战，是内部的斗争，而任何一个其他国家只要考虑国际法和联合国宪章的要求，就不能也不应该进行干涉。但是热中于为美英的直接的和无耻的侵略寻找理由的杜勒斯先生，力求证明黎巴嫩和约旦的内部斗争是外部挑拨的结果。殖民主义者多年来一直企图把帝国主义殖民制度瓦解的不可遏止的世界历史进程说成是外部阴谋的结果，这是尽人皆知的老一套的荒诞的手法。甚至很多美国政客也劝告白宫不要闭着眼睛不看阿拉伯民族主义高涨的情况，要考虑阿拉伯人民已永远地、坚决地走上了争取民族独立斗争的道路这个事实。但是杜勒斯先生继续顽固地把这个斗争说成是某种“间接侵略”的结果，并且甚至说要监督一个国家对另外一个国家的无线电广播。
    美国国务卿妄想说服世界，他硬说：中近东发生的事件不是美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦人民进行的直接、无端的侵略，而是一种玄妙的有人策划的“间接侵略”。这还不够，杜勒斯竟想使这种骇人听闻地歪曲当前事件的颠倒黑白的说法得到最高级会议的承认。他在记者招待会上大嚷说，我们应当使人们正视一个事实：现在由于有人采取间接侵略而造成的政治不稳定已经产生了巨大的危险。
    杜勒斯甚至认为，要把承认这一点作为讨论近东政治和经济稳定的一切问题的先决条件。他威胁说，如果不承认这一点，那么“和平将受到真正的威胁”。换句话说，国务卿想让其他国家也同意扩大美英对阿拉伯东方的侵略。杜勒斯在记者招待会上讲的话的用意就是这样，但是这同各国人民一致要求立即停止美英对阿拉伯东方的侵略，让阿拉伯人民自己来决定自己的命运的愿望是背道而驰的。
    侵略者企图得到一份充当阿拉伯人民反抗侵略的保护人的执照。杜勒斯耍赖的用意也在于此。但是任何一个思维正常的人都不能同意他这样提出问题。
