Let Quyi Play a Greater Role in Propaganda and Education
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The First National Quyi Performance Convention is being held in the capital. Holding this convention during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and culture is of great significance. Through this review and mobilization meeting, Quyi workers will further boost their energy, improve their ideological and professional levels, and better serve the cause of socialism.

Quyi is a traditional art form popular with the laboring people of all ethnic groups in our country. It is light, flexible, easy to popularize, and has extensive and close ties with the masses. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, the awareness of Quyi artists has significantly improved. They have quickly cooperated with various political movements and central tasks, going deep into factories, rural areas, and military units to perform, becoming a small and capable light cavalry in the literary and art army. For example, Quyi artists in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, have persisted in going to the countryside and mountains to deliver Quyi to people's doors for several years. In just six months, forty-three artists traveled to every village in the county. Since the all-round great leap forward, a upsurge of "telling new stories and good stories" has been set off among Quyi artists. The artists have broken superstitions, boldly carried out creation, and strived to express modern life themes. New Quyi programs have become mainstream. For example, Quyi artists in Tianjin, in order to promote the general line and oppose the aggression of the Middle East by US and British imperialism, created a new program and performed it on the streets in just thirty minutes after seeing the news in the newspaper. They have established many fixed storytelling and singing bases in streets and alleys, and often carry out propaganda to the masses. Quyi has also made some new creations in artistic form. In order to sing about the new society more powerfully, Pingtan artists in Shanghai have adopted a multi-person chorus form in the opening chapters. This artistic innovation is a beneficial attempt.

In recent years, many loyal and dedicated artists who serve the people have emerged in the vast Quyi team. Han Qixiang, who used the Sanxian as a submachine gun during the Liberation War, is now using the Sanxian as a hoe to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Because he is blind and cannot go to the mountains to work, he carries the Sanxian to the fields to tell stories to the masses and promote the Party's policies; Gao Yuanjun, a famous artist who tells Shandong Kuaishu, has traveled from the front lines of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to the northwest border, and from Hainan Island to the Great Northern Wilderness. He has left his footprints in many places where troops are stationed. Many Quyi artists have implemented the policy of literature and art serving politics, serving production, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have played a pioneering role on the literary and art front.

Quyi art has close ties with other literary and art forms in our country. It has had a significant impact on the development of literature, opera, and music. The classic Chinese novels "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" were gradually enriched by professional authors based on the long-circulated storytelling and drum lyrics. Many opera genres, especially young genres formed in the last hundred years, such as Huju, Chuju, and Luju, have developed from local Quyi. Therefore, new literary and art workers will suffer a loss if they do not sincerely learn from tradition and learn from Quyi, which has a long tradition. They should humbly learn from Quyi artists. This National Quyi Performance Convention is a rare and concentrated opportunity to learn. For Quyi artists themselves, they should not only learn from each other and exchange experiences through the convention, but also learn the advantages of other art forms in the future to continuously enrich themselves.

In the vast factories, mines, rural areas, and military units of our country, there are amateur Quyi activists who are many times larger than professional Quyi workers. They are an important part of the entire Quyi team. They are laborers and amateur Quyi enthusiasts; their experience and achievements will be a source of nutrition for Quyi artists to continuously absorb in politics and artistic creation. At the same time, they also need the guidance and help of professional Quyi workers. Through mutual learning and supplementation, this huge Quyi team will promote the early formation of a socialist national new Quyi.

In order to create a socialist national new Quyi, Quyi workers must learn to walk on two legs in the future. While further consolidating and continuously improving the creation level of modern Quyi programs, it is necessary to continue to explore and sort out excellent traditional Quyi programs and traditional performing arts. Because the emergence of excellent modern Quyi programs must be based on inheriting traditional Quyi programs. And the creation of new modern Quyi programs will improve our ability to sort out traditional Quyi programs.

In the past few years, although Quyi artists have made great progress under the leadership of the Party and the government, most artists have not yet been organized, nor have they undergone centralized and systematic political study. Many people still have serious ideas of valuing the past and belittling the present, and emphasizing business and neglecting politics. In terms of art, there is also a tendency to stick to conventions. In addition, some artists are still illiterate. We hope that the vast number of Quyi artists, under the leadership of local Party committees and cultural authorities, can quickly organize themselves through various forms, which does not contradict the practice of adopting a decentralized approach to activities. They should conduct political and cultural studies in a planned manner, earnestly transform their thinking, and boldly carry out artistic innovation, so that they can become cultural and artistic fighters who are cultured and can adapt to the needs of the all-round great leap forward, and play a greater role in the socialist construction cause.

    让曲艺发挥更大的宣传教育作用
    本报评论员
    第一届全国曲艺会演大会正在首都举行。在工农业生产和文化大跃进的时候举行这个会演，是有重要的意义的。曲艺工作者通过这一次的检阅和誓师的大会，将更加鼓足干劲，提高思想和业务水平，更好地为社会主义事业服务。
    曲艺是我国各族劳动人民喜闻乐见的传统艺术形式，它轻便灵活，易于普及，同群众有广泛密切的联系。全国解放以来，在党和政府的领导和关怀下，曲艺艺人的觉悟有了显著的提高。他们迅速地配合了各种政治运动和中心工作，深入工农兵，进行演出活动，成为文艺大军中一支短小精悍的轻骑兵。像浙江义乌县的曲艺艺人，几年来一直坚持了下乡上山，送曲上门的活动方式。四十三个艺人，在短短的半年中，便走遍了全县的每一个村落。全面大跃进以来，在曲艺艺人中，更是掀起了“说新书说好书”的热潮。艺人们破除迷信，大胆地进行创作，努力表现现代生活题材，新的曲艺节目已经成为主流。比如天津的曲艺艺人，为了宣传总路线和反对美英帝国主义侵略中东，看到了报纸上的消息后，仅仅三十分钟，就创作了新节目上街演出。他们在大街小巷建立了许多固定的说唱据点，经常向群众进行宣传。曲艺在艺术形式上也有了一些新的创造。上海的评弹艺人为了更有力地歌唱新社会，在开篇中，采用了多人的合唱形式。这种艺术上的革新，是有益的尝试。
    几年来，在广大的曲艺队伍中，涌现了不少忠心耿耿、为人民服务的优秀艺人。解放战争时期，把三弦当作冲锋枪的韩起祥，现在又把三弦当作镢头，参加了祖国的社会主义建设。他因为眼睛看不见，不能上山劳动，便背着三弦到地里给群众说书，宣传党的政策；说山东快书的著名艺人高元钧，从抗美援朝前线到西北边疆，从海南岛到北大荒，在许多部队所在的地方，都有过他的足迹。许多曲艺艺人贯彻了文艺为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的方针，起了文艺战线上的尖兵作用。
    曲艺艺术和我国其他的文学艺术形式，有着密切的关系。它对文学、戏曲和音乐的发展，都发生过很大的影响。我国的古典小说“水浒传”、“三国演义”，就是从长期流传的评书、鼓词中逐渐经过专业作者的加工而丰富起来的。许多戏曲剧种，特别是近百年来才形成的年轻剧种，如沪剧、楚剧、吕剧等，都是从当地的曲艺发展起来的。因此，新文艺工作者，如果不真心诚意地向传统学习，不向有着悠久传统的曲艺学习，将是一个损失。他们应该谦虚地向曲艺艺人学习，这次全国曲艺会演大会就是一个难得而又集中学习的好机会。对于曲艺艺人本身来说，不仅应通过会演，互相学习，交流经验，今后也应该学习其他艺术形式的优点，来不断地丰富自己。
    在我国广大的厂矿、农村、部队里，有着比专业曲艺工作者庞大到不知多少倍的业余曲艺活动积极分子，他们是整个曲艺队伍中一个重要的组成部分。他们是劳动者，又是业余曲艺爱好者；他们的经验和成就将是曲艺艺人在政治上和艺术创造上，不断吸取营养的源泉。同时，他们也还需要专业曲艺工作者的辅导和帮助。经过相互间的学习和补充，这一支巨大的曲艺队伍，将会促使社会主义的民族新曲艺早日形成。
    为了创造社会主义的民族新曲艺，曲艺工作者今后必须学会用两条腿走路的做法。在进一步巩固和不断提高现代曲目创作水平的同时，需要继续发掘和整理优秀的传统曲目，以及传统的表演艺术。因为，优秀的现代曲目的出现，一定是建立在继承了传统曲目的基础之上。而新的现代曲目的创作，又会提高我们整理传统曲目的能力。
    过去的几年中，在党和政府的领导下，曲艺艺人虽然有了很大的进步，但大多数艺人还没有组织起来，也没有经过集中和系统的政治学习，不少人仍有严重的厚古薄今、重业务轻政治的思想。在艺术上，也还有着墨守陈规的倾向。此外，有的艺人还处在文盲状态。我们希望广大的曲艺艺人，在各地党委和文化主管部门的领导下，能够迅速地通过各种不同的形式组织起来，这和活动方式仍要采取分散的做法并不矛盾，应该有计划地进行政治学习和文化学习，认真地改造思想，大胆地进行艺术革新，使自己成为一个有文化、而又能适应全面大跃进需要的文艺战士，在社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
