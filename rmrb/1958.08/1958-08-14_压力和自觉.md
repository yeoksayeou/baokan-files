　　Pressure and Consciousness
　　Lin Wei
    Many people dislike the word "pressure." This word makes people think of the phenomenon of people oppressing people in the old society. In fact, "pressure" itself is not bad. Counter-revolutionaries and criminals who undermine revolutionary laws all need pressure. Otherwise, it would be impossible to consolidate the people's regime and build socialism. Except for anarchists, everyone acknowledges this principle.
    What I want to talk about here is another kind of pressure – the "situation forcing people" pressure created by mass movements and high-tide situations.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, various regions and departments have used "movements" to advance their work, completing a large number of tasks in a short period of time that would have taken many years or even centuries to complete in the past. From the rural perspective, in addition to the great water conservancy movement, there was the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement, the deep plowing and soil improvement movement, the agricultural tool reform movement, the tree planting and afforestation movement, the eliminate the four pests and sanitation movement, the eliminate illiteracy movement, and the movement to establish industries in every township and commune... The number and scale of these movements are truly unprecedented in rural areas at home and abroad. The speed of the results is equivalent to twenty years in a single day. Some time ago, agricultural conferences were held in Southwest, Northeast, and other regions, and further mention was made of "weekly movements." This does not mean that there must be a movement every seven days, but even if there were a movement for every solar term in the lunar calendar, it would only be about fifteen days apart. In short, the idea is to have frequent movements and continuous movements, just as Comrade Mao Zedong advocated "continuous revolution."
    Every few days, the demands of the masses are concentrated, catchy slogans are put forward, and one or several goals and tasks are proposed. Broad mass movements are organized to complete these tasks in a concentrated manner and achieve definite results as quickly as possible. Then slogans are put forward again, and movements are organized again. This should be said to be a very good leadership method and a development of the mass line. This method can greatly accelerate the speed of socialist production and construction and greatly shorten the historical process. However, some people do not like this kind of leadership method very much and do not like movements very much. One of the main reasons is that movements easily create pressure and violate the principle of consciousness. The conditions and situations in different regions vary greatly, but movements are somewhat "unreasonable," and it is not honorable to fall behind.
    Will movements create pressure? If pressure is created, is this a good thing or a bad thing? It should be affirmed that movements will create pressure. But this is not a bad thing, but a good thing.
    In the old society, people went their separate ways, each seeking a livelihood. Some did good things, and doing bad things also had their own "reasons," the so-called "you have one set of rights and wrongs, and I have another." At that time, this kind of pressure certainly did not exist, but neither did revolution, nor was there a future. What loomed overhead was reactionary rule! -- These are already too far away. To put it more recently, from the second half of 1956 to the first half of 1957, there were the fewest movements and the least pressure in terms of production and construction. What was the result? From the rural point of view, the result was that little progress was made in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and many aspects such as close planting, multiple cropping, high-yield crops, and agricultural production technology reform even regressed. The production level reached in 1956 during the extraordinary natural disasters was only slightly exceeded in 1957. The people were unwilling to live a poor and backward life for a long time and were unwilling to remain depressed for a long time. Starting in the winter of 1957, under the correct leadership of the Party, they once again launched a high tide of production and construction, an even greater high tide. What was the result? Whether in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, field management, agricultural tool reform, or other aspects, unprecedented and tremendous progress was made, as people well know. The increase in summer crops and early rice exceeded any year in history. Now we can see a law: with movement and the pressure of movement, our cause will advance by leaps and bounds, like a whirlwind, breaking through all difficulties and advancing vigorously. Conversely, without movement and the pressure of movement, people will do what they want, and if they don't want to, they will disperse. Our cause will be slow to progress or even regress.
    Does the pressure discussed here violate the principle of consciousness? Pressure and consciousness are two contradictory concepts. But going deep into real life to investigate, there is no insurmountable boundary between the two. Under certain conditions, they can transform into each other and unite, just as dialectics indicates. We can understand this point by examining the causes and results of pressure formation.
    How is this pressure formed? In general, its root lies in the exemplary actions and advanced examples of the masses. Henan basically achieved water conservancy in just over half a year, a network of rivers and streams appeared in Huaibei, the not-very-fertile Xiangyang area of ​​Hubei Province took the lead in wheat production, the Yulin sandy area of ​​northern Shaanxi saw the emergence of Thousand Catty Gully, and the peasants of Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, produced all the chemical fertilizers needed for their cultivated land themselves... When the local Party and the masses of peasants were creating these miraculous achievements, they did not necessarily think about "checking" others; they just wanted to create happiness for the people. However, it was precisely these advanced examples that severely "checked" all regions with roughly the same or even better conditions. "People can do it, why can't you?" Leading organs at higher levels and the broad masses of cadres and people will unanimously raise such questions. In this way, a very heavy pressure is generated.
    The peasants uniting as one for their own interests and working hard is a high degree of consciousness. This conscious effort created a large number of miracles, that is, advanced examples. And advanced examples have become a pressure on other regions. Simply put, the consciousness of the masses has turned into pressure, which is a transformation.
    What are the results of this pressure? A very small number of people will desperately find various external causes, favorable objective conditions, and even some accidental factors to explain other people's achievements. However, most people will learn the revolutionary drive and correct methods from advanced examples and take concrete measures based on their own conditions, the so-called learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. The result is a great leap forward in work, catching up with or even surpassing the original advanced, and advancing together. In this way, the original consciousness of a smaller part of the masses develops into the consciousness of a larger part of the masses, and the original not-very-deep consciousness develops into a deeper consciousness. To sum up this development process into a formula is "consciousness - pressure - wider range and deeper consciousness."
    It can be seen here that the pressure generated by mass movements is by no means a coercion of the minority over the majority, but a manifestation of revolution overwhelming conservatism, activity overwhelming passivity, vigor overwhelming stagnation, and the red flag overwhelming the white and yellow flags. It signifies that a revolutionary and upward social opinion has been formed, and all evil winds and unhealthy trends that are not conducive to the socialist cause have lost their market. All revolutionary comrades should raise both hands to support such pressure and warmly cheer and sing praises for such pressure. To praise such pressure is to praise the people, to praise the awakening of the people, and to praise the arrival of the great revolutionary high tide.

### 压力和自觉

　　压力和自觉
　　林韦
    许多人不喜欢“压力”这个字眼。这个字眼使人们联想到旧社会人压迫人的现象。其实，“压力”本身并不是坏的。对反革命分子和破坏革命法律的犯罪分子就都需要压力。不然，巩固人民政权和建设社会主义都是不可能的。除了无政府主义者，这种道理是人人承认的。
    这里要谈的是另外一种压力——群众运动和高潮形势所造成的一种“形势逼人”的压力。
    大跃进以来，各地区各部门都用“运动”来推进工作，在很短的期间突击完成大量的、在过去需要好多年甚至好多世纪才能完成的任务。从农村方面说，伟大的水利运动之外有积肥造肥运动，深翻地和改良土壤运动，农具改革运动，植树造林运动，除四害和卫生运动，扫除文盲运动，还有乡乡社社办工业的运动……。运动之多，规模之大，真是古今中外的农村所未有。收效之快，则一天抵得上二十年。前些时西南、东北和其他地区开农业会议，更进一步提到“周周运动”。这虽然不是说七天一定要有一个运动，但是如果按照农历每一个节令一个运动，也不过十五天左右。总之是要经常运动，不断运动，正如毛泽东同志所倡导的“不断革命”。
    每隔一些时日就把群众的要求集中起来，提出响亮的口号，提出一项或几项奋斗目标和任务，组织广大群众性的运动来突击完成，尽快地取得确定的成果。然后再提口号，再组织运动。这应当说是一个很好的领导方法，是群众路线的发展。这种方法能够大大地加快社会主义生产和建设的速度，大大地缩短历史的进程。可是，有一些人却很不喜欢这样的领导方法，很不喜欢运动。主要的原因之一，是说运动容易造成一种压力，违反自觉的原则。各地情况和条件大有不同，而运动却有点“不由分说”、跑慢了就不光彩。
    运动会不会产生压力呢？如果产生压力，这是好事还是坏事呢？应当肯定，运动会产生压力。但这不是坏事，而是好事。
    在旧社会，人们各奔东西，各谋生路，干好事的也有，干坏事也自有一番“道理”，所谓“你也一是非，我也一是非”。那时候，现在这种压力当然没有，可是革命也没有，前途也没有，笼罩着的是反动统治呀！——这些已经太远了。说近一点，1956年下半年到1957年上半年，在生产和建设方面是运动最少、压力最小的时候。结果怎样呢？从农村方面看，结果就是兴修水利和积肥工作进展很少，密植、复种、高产作物以及农业生产技术的改革等许多方面，甚至后退了。1956年在特大自然灾害中所达到的生产水平，1957年只能略略超过一点。人民群众不愿意长期过又穷又白的生活，不愿意长期消沉下去，从1957年冬季起，他们在党的正确领导下重新掀起了生产建设的高潮，更大的高潮。结果怎样呢？无论在水利、积肥、改良土壤、田间管理、农具改革和其他方面，都取得了人们熟知的空前巨大的进展。夏收作物和早稻的增产，超过历史上任何年度。现在我们可以看到一个规律：有了运动和运动的压力，我们的事业就会一日千里，势如破竹，冲决一切困难向前猛进。反之，没有了运动和运动的压力，人们爱干就干，不干就散，我们的事业就会迟迟不进，甚至向后倒退。
    这里所谈的压力，是不是违反了自觉的原则呢？压力和自觉，是两个矛盾的概念。但是深入到现实生活中去考察，二者之间并无不可逾越的界线。在一定的条件下，它们正像辩证法所指示的那样，可以互相转化，统一起来。这一点，我们只要把压力形成的原因和它的结果考察一下就明白了。
    这种压力是怎么形成的呢？概括地说，它的根源是群众的模范行动和先进的榜样。河南半年多就基本实现了水利化，淮北出现了四通八达的河网，湖北省并不肥沃的襄阳地区在小麦产量方面领了先，陕北榆林的风沙区出现了千斤沟，山西省清徐县农民自己生产了全部耕地所需的化肥……。当地的党和农民群众在创造这些奇迹般的成就的时候，他们并不一定想到要去“将”别人的“军”，他们只是想给人民创造幸福。但是，正好就是他们这些先进的榜样，向所有条件大体相同甚至条件更好的地区狠狠地“将”了一“军”。“人家能够做到，你们为什么做不到？”上级领导机关和广大的干部群众都会不约而同地发出这样的质问。这样，一种很沉重的压力就产生了。
    农民群众为着自身的利益而结成一体，苦干苦战，这是一种高度的自觉。这种自觉的努力创造了大量的奇迹，也就是先进的榜样。而先进的榜样却变成了对于其他地区的压力。简单说，就是群众的自觉变成了压力，这是一个转化。
    这种压力产生什么结果呢？有很少的人会拼命地找出各种各样的外因、有利的客观条件以至一些偶然的因素来解释人家的成就。但是，大部分人将从先进的榜样学习到革命的干劲和正确的方法，根据自己的条件采取具体的措施，所谓学先进，赶先进。结果是工作大跃进，赶上以至超过原来的先进者，共同跃进。这样，原来较小部分的群众的自觉就发展成为更大部分的群众的自觉，原来不很深刻的自觉就发展成为更加深刻的自觉。把这个发展的进程归结成一个公式，就是“自觉——压力——更大范围和更深的自觉”。
    这里可以看出，群众运动所产生的压力决不是少数人对多数人的强迫命令，而是革命压倒保守、积极压倒消极、朝气压倒暮气、红旗压倒白旗黄旗的表现。它标志着革命的向上的社会舆论已经形成，一切不利于社会主义事业的歪风邪气已经失去市场。一切的革命同志，都应当举双手拥护这样的压力，热烈地欢呼和歌颂这样的压力。歌颂这样的压力，就是歌颂人民，歌颂人民的觉醒，歌颂伟大的革命高潮的到来。
