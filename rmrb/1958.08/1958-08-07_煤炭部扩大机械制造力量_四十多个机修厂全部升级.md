Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The mechanical repair factories of the national coal mine system are using the spirit of hard work and diligence to manufacture large quantities of mechanical equipment to support the great leap forward of the coal industry.

According to the preliminary plans formulated by each factory, it is expected that in the second half of this year, the factories will produce complete sets of hydraulic coal mining equipment needed for nearly one hundred mining areas, more than fifty combined coal mining machines, and a large number of electric locomotives, mine cars, drilling machines, and hoisting equipment. According to the plan, in the next five years, with the exception of extra-large and precision-complicated machines, most of the general coal mining equipment and special equipment will be manufactured by the mechanical repair and manufacturing departments of the coal industry system itself.

The mechanical manufacturing potential in the coal industry system is very large. In addition to the three mining machinery manufacturing plants under the Ministry of Coal Industry, many larger mining bureaus have central repair plants, and below them, there are many mine repair plants. The largest of these repair plants have more than two thousand workers, and the smallest have one to two hundred people. As long as the equipment is slightly adjusted, various machines and equipment can be manufactured. For example, the workers of the Central Repair Plant of the Kailuan Mining Bureau used only six days and nights to make a complete set of hydraulic lifting equipment that reached international standards. A small repair plant of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau with only more than twenty machine tools has also produced many machines such as electric motors, rock grabbers, automatic lathes, steam hammers, and punches.

In order to use this mechanical manufacturing force in a planned way, the Ministry of Coal Industry recently convened a leap forward meeting of its affiliated mechanical manufacturing and repair factories. The meeting discussed some policy issues in coal mine machinery manufacturing and decided to upgrade all forty-odd central repair plants into manufacturing plants; the repair work of related production equipment will mainly be undertaken by the mine repair plants.

    煤炭部扩大机械制造力量  四十多个机修厂全部升级
    据新华社6日讯　全国煤矿系统的许多机械修理工厂正在用穷干苦干的精神，制造大批机械设备，支援煤炭工业大跃进。
    根据各厂初步制定的计划，预计在今年下半年内，各厂将生产出近一百个采区所需的全套水力采煤设备，五十多台联合采煤机以及大量的电机车、矿车、钻探机和提升设备等。按照计划，今后五年内，除了特大型和精密复杂的机器以外，一般的煤矿采掘设备和专用设备，绝大部分将由煤炭工业系统的机械修理和制造部门自己制造。
    煤炭工业系统中的机械制造潜力很大，除了煤炭工业部所属的三个矿山机械制造厂以外，许多较大的矿务局都有中央机修厂，下面还有很多矿井修理厂。这些机修厂最大的有二千多工人，最小的也有一百到二百人。只要在设备上稍加调整，就能制造各种机器设备。如开滦矿务局中央机修厂的职工只用了六昼夜工夫，就做出了达到国际水平的全套水力提升设备。只有二十多台机床的焦作矿务局的小修理厂，也造出了电动机、抓岩机、自动车床、汽锤、冲床等许多机器。
    为了有计划地使用这支机械制造力量，煤炭工业部在最近召开了所属机械制造修理工厂的跃进会议。会上讨论了煤矿机械制造中的一些方针性问题，决定把四十多个中央机修厂全部提升为制造厂；有关生产设备的修理工作，主要将由矿井修理厂来担负。
