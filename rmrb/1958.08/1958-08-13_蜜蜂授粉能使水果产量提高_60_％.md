　　Bee Pollination Can Increase Fruit Production by 60%

　　In terms of increasing fruit tree production, in addition to measures such as increasing fertilizer application, reasonable pruning, fruit thinning, and pest and disease control, using honeybees to pollinate fruit trees is a new and effective measure to make fruits grow better and bear more. Generally speaking, it can increase fruit production by more than 60%, and also make the fruit larger and taste fresher.

　　The No. 1 State-owned Farm in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, has 300 "Guoguang" apple trees in Nanda Yue, Lingqian District, Dalian City. In the past, the total yield was only 2.25 tons. In 1950, using eight bee colonies for pollination, the total yield reached 4.5 tons, doubling the production. The farm has 400 apricot trees in Leizi Mountain, Yingchengzi District. The annual yield in the past was 3.5 tons. In 1952, twelve bee colonies were used for pollination, resulting in six tons of apricots. In 1953, sixteen bee colonies were used for pollination, and the yield increased to ten tons, tripling the production.

　　The method of using honeybees to pollinate fruit trees is very simple. Just move the bee colonies to the orchard before the fruit trees bloom. Generally speaking, for fruit trees such as apples, peaches, apricots, plums, etc., one to two boxes of bees per ten mu can meet the pollination needs. For fruit trees rich in nectar, such as jujubes, citrus, lychees, and longans, one bee colony is needed per mu.

### 蜜蜂授粉能使水果产量提高60％

　　蜜蜂授粉能使水果产量提高60％
    在提高果树产量方面，除去增施肥料，合理整枝，进行疏果和防治病虫害等措施外，利用蜜蜂给果树授粉是使水果长得更好，结得更多的一个新的有效措施。一般来说它可以使水果增产60％以上，而且使水果长得更大口味更鲜美。
    辽宁省旅大市地方国营第一农场在旅大市岭前区南大岳有三百株国光苹果，过去的总产量不过二点二五吨，1950年用八群蜜蜂授粉，总产量达到四点五吨，增产一倍。该场在营城子区磊子山有四百株杏树，过去的年产量是三点五吨，1952年用十二群蜂授粉，结果生产了六吨杏；于1953年用十六群蜂授粉，产量提高到十吨，增产二倍。
    用蜜蜂为果树授粉作法很简单，只需在果树开花前，将蜂群迁移到果园即可。一般的果树，如苹果、桃、杏、李等等，每十亩有一至二箱蜂即可满足授粉需要。分泌蜜汁丰富的果树，如枣、柑桔、荔枝、龙眼等，每亩就需要一群蜂。
