Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Eisenhower's deceptive plan presented at the United Nations Emergency Special Session continues to be strongly criticized by Middle Eastern public opinion. The public opinion in countries like the United Arab Republic, Lebanon, and Iraq unanimously pointed out that the "peace" facade and the "economic aid" trickery used in Eisenhower's speech cannot conceal the aggressive crimes of the United States and Britain and their ambition to continue enslaving the people of the Middle East. These opinions pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly should demand that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from the Middle East.

United Arab Republic
    A commentator from Cairo Radio said that the real purpose of Eisenhower's new proposal to the United Nations General Assembly is to maintain imperialist control and political and economic domination over the Arab East.
    In a radio commentary broadcast on the evening of the 16th, the radio station's commentator said that seeing that the Arab liberation movement was about to complete its task of breaking away from imperialist rule and control, imperialism took the last resort and launched armed aggression against the Arab people of Lebanon and Jordan. Therefore, all the excuses used by the United States and Britain to whitewash their occupation are deceptive.
    Referring to Eisenhower's proposal to provide economic assistance, the commentator said, "It is good that Eisenhower talks about economic development," but it would be better if he could explain for whose benefit this development is intended: is this development for the benefit of the people of the Middle East, or for the interests of American monopoly capitalists?
    The commentator disagreed with Eisenhower's statement that peace in Jordan was threatened. He said that the threat to Hussein and his regime does not come from outside, but from the Jordanian people. The reason for this threat is Hussein's subservience to imperialism. Therefore, the only way to solve the Jordan problem is for the British troops to withdraw.
Lebanon
    The Lebanese public sharply criticized Eisenhower's proposal on the Middle East issue. Lebanese parliamentarian Anwar al-Khatib published an article in "Al-Telegraph," commenting on Eisenhower's speech at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session. He wrote: "The American proposal is full of contradictions, fallacies, and sophistry. Using the pretext of maintaining peace to establish an international police force is nothing more than to scare small countries and make them continue to submit to the United States."
    According to "Al-Telegraph," Lebanese parliamentarian Fizeili said: "The American proposal should be seen as: the United States wants to plunder the natural wealth of Middle Eastern countries, interfere in their political and economic affairs, and prevent them from developing in accordance with the interests of the people of the countries in this region."
    "Al-Siyassa" wrote that the "fire brigade" proposed by Eisenhower has only one purpose—to extinguish the flames of the national liberation movement in the Arab East. As for the six-point plan proposed by Eisenhower, its purpose is to impose United Nations trusteeship on the Arab peoples in order to obstruct their liberation movement and undermine their unity. The United States put forward these plans in order to cover up the truth of the American occupation of Lebanon, and the United States is unwilling to determine the date for the cessation of the occupation.
    Former Lebanese parliamentarian Abdullah Hajj telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, saying: "Under the guise of protecting our country from so-called 'indirect interference' in internal affairs, the US military has occupied our country, which is a shameful and ugly act…I demand that the UN General Assembly resolutely demand the US military withdraw from Lebanon without delay."
Iraq
    Under the title "Obviously Trying to Cover Up Imperialist Failure," the Iraqi newspaper "Al-Zaman" published an editorial on the 16th, saying that the purpose of the plan proposed by the United States at the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly "is to obstruct the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the main issues, which is to stop US and British aggression in the Middle East and to make the imperialist troops immediately withdraw from Jordan and Lebanon. This conference was convened for this issue."
    The editorial pointed out that the crisis that seriously threatens world peace occurred mainly because US and British troops invaded Middle Eastern countries. The editorial emphasized the great role of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Arab countries and other countries, as well as the mutual defense agreement between the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic, in preventing US and British aggression against Arab countries.

    阿拉伯人坚决要美英侵略军滚蛋
　　中东舆论继续痛斥艾森豪威尔的欺骗性计划
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：艾森豪威尔在联合国紧急特别会议上提出的欺骗性计划，继续受到中东舆论的强烈抨击。阿联、黎巴嫩、伊拉克等国的舆论一致指出，艾森豪威尔的演说中所用的“和平”的幌子和“经济援助”的骗局，并不能掩饰美英两国的侵略罪行和企图继续奴役中东人民的野心。这些舆论指出，联合国大会应该要求美英立即把军队撤出中东。阿　联
    开罗电台评论员说，艾森豪威尔向联合国大会提出的新建议的真正目的，是要维持帝国主义对阿拉伯东方的控制和政治经济上的统治。
    这家电台的评论员在16日晚上发表的广播评论中说，帝国主义看到阿拉伯解放运动快要完成它的摆脱帝国主义统治和控制的任务，便采取了最后手段，对黎巴嫩和约旦的阿拉伯人民进行武装侵略。因此，美国和英国用来粉饰它们的占领的一切借口都是骗人的。
    评论员谈到艾森豪威尔提供经济援助的建议，他说，“艾森豪威尔谈到经济发展是好的”，但是，如果他能说明一下这种发展是为了谁的利益，那就会好一些：这种发展是为了中东人民的好处呢？还是为美国垄断资本家的利益？
    评论员不同意艾森豪威尔所说的约旦的和平遭到了威胁的说法。他说，侯赛因和他的政权受到的威胁不是来自外界，而是来自约旦人民。产生这种威胁的原因是侯赛因屈从帝国主义。因此解决约旦问题的唯一办法是英国军队撤出去。黎巴嫩
    黎巴嫩广大公众尖锐抨击艾森豪威尔关于中东问题的建议。黎巴嫩议会议员安瓦尔·哈提卜在“电讯报”上发表文章，评论艾森豪威尔在联大紧急特别会议上的演说，他写道：“美国的提案充满了矛盾、谬论和诡辩。以维护和平为借口来建立国际警察部队，只不过是为了吓唬小国，使它们继续屈从美国”。
    据“电讯报”报道，黎巴嫩议会议员菲泽利说：“美国提案应当被看成是：美国想掠夺中东国家的天然财富，干涉它们的政治事务和经济事务，并且不让它们根据这个地区国家人民的利益来进行发展”。
    “政治报”写道，艾森豪威尔建议成立的“消防队”只有一个目的——扑灭阿拉伯东方民族解放运动的火焰。至于艾森豪威尔所建议的六点计划，其目的是要把联合国的托管强加在阿拉伯国家人民头上，来阻挠他们的解放运动，破坏他们的团结。美国提出这些计划是为了掩饰美国占领黎巴嫩的真相，美国不愿意确定停止占领的日期。
    黎巴嫩议会前议员阿卜杜拉·哈杰打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，电报说：“美军在保护我国以防止所谓‘间接干涉’内政的幌子下占领了我国，这种行动是可耻的，丑恶的………我要求联合国大会坚决要求美军毫不拖延地从黎巴嫩撤退”。伊拉克
    伊拉克“时代报”16日以“显然力图掩饰帝国主义的失败”为题发表社论说：美国在联合国大会紧急会议上所提的计划的目的，“是要阻挠联合国大会讨论主要的问题，这就是制止美英在中东的侵略和使帝国主义军队立即撤出约旦和黎巴嫩。这次大会就是为了这个问题而召开的”。
    社论指出，这次严重威胁世界和平的危机所以发生，主要是由于美英军队侵入中东国家。社论强调指出了苏联、中华人民共和国、阿拉伯国家和其他各国人民以及伊拉克共和国与阿拉伯联合共和国之间的共同防御协定，对于制止美英对阿拉伯国家的侵略的巨大作用。
