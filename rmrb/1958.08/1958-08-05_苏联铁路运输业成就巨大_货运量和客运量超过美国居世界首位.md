Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: Materials published in Moscow newspapers today indicate that the Soviet Union's railway freight and passenger volume has long surpassed that of the United States, ranking first in the world. Last year, the Soviet Union's freight volume had already increased more than seventeen times compared to 1913, and passenger volume had also increased five times.

The materials show that this year, the Soviet Union's railway freight volume will increase by 52 billion ton-kilometers. This increase alone is approximately one and a half times the entire railway freight volume of the United Kingdom. In 1958 alone, the Soviet Union's freight volume transported by internal combustion locomotives was equivalent to the total railway freight volume of the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany.

Since 1956, approximately 17,000 kilometers of railway lines in the Soviet Union have been converted to electric and internal combustion locomotive traction. A quarter of the total railway transportation volume is transported using these two types of locomotives. This year, an additional 4,000 kilometers of railway lines will be converted to electric and internal combustion locomotives.

The Soviet Union is currently laying four railway lines with a total length of 5,000 kilometers along the banks of Siberian rivers, in the foothills of the Ural Mountains, and in Kazakhstan and southern and eastern Soviet Union. These railway lines will change the economic landscape of these regions. The Central Siberian Main Line (from Barnaul to Kustanai), which is approximately 2,000 kilometers long, is currently one of the most important construction projects.

Construction has begun on the Taishet-Abakan railway line, which will open up access to the inexhaustible and rich resources of the southern Krasnoyarsk Territory and connect eastern Siberia with the Kuznetsk region, Central Asia, and many regions of Kazakhstan.

New railways totaling 1,300 kilometers in the reclaimed areas, the Bratsk Hydropower Station, the Volga River basin, Ukraine, and other trunk lines serving the opening up of new mining areas and the logging of northern forests in the eastern Soviet Union will be completed and opened to traffic this year. In the latter five months of 1958, approximately 1,400 kilometers of electrified trunk lines will be opened to traffic.

    苏联铁路运输业成就巨大
    货运量和客运量超过美国居世界首位
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　今天莫斯科各报刊登的材料表明，苏联铁路货运量和客运量早已超过了美国，而居世界第一位。苏联货运量去年就已经比1913年增加了十七倍多，客运量也增加了五倍。
    材料表明，今年苏联铁路货运量将增加五百二十亿吨公里。单是这个增加额就约相当于英国整个铁路货运量的一倍半。单只1958年一年苏联的内燃机车的货运量就相当于英国、法国和西德铁路货运量的总和。
    从1956年起，苏联就已有约一万七千公里的铁路线改用电气机车和内燃机车牵引。在全部铁路运输量中有四分之一是采用上述两种机车作牵引力来进行运输的。今年，采用电气机车和内燃机车的铁路线还要增加四千公里。
    苏联目前正在西伯利亚各条河流的两岸、在乌拉尔山麓、哈萨克和苏联南部和东部铺设共长五千公里的四条铁路线，这些铁路线将改变这些地区的经济面貌。长达两千公里左右的中西伯利亚干线（自巴尔瑙尔到库斯坦奈）是目前最重要的建筑工程之一。
    塔伊谢特——阿巴根铁路线已开始修建，这条线路将给克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区南部无穷无尽的丰富资源打开出路，并且把东西伯利亚和库兹涅茨克地区、中亚细亚和哈萨克许多地区连接起来。
    在垦荒地区、布拉次克水电站、伏尔加河流域、乌克兰等地的长达一千三百公里的新铁路，以及另外一些为开垦苏联东部新矿区和采伐北方森林服务的干线，在今年内将要完工和通车。在1958年的后五个月中，大约有一千四百公里的电气化干线将要通车。
