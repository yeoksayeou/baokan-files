How to Make Potato Chips

Potatoes differ from ordinary grains in that they have a high water content and thin skins, making them susceptible to disease and frost damage, and difficult to store and transport.

In response to these characteristics of potatoes, it is necessary to actively develop potato drying, starch production, and other processing industries. Here is an introduction to the method of making potato chips.

Selection, Washing, and Grading of Raw Materials

To obtain high-quality potato chips, reduce the consumption of raw materials, and thus reduce product costs, the most important factor is to select raw materials that meet the processing requirements. Potatoes used for processing potato chips should generally meet the following requirements: (1) Potatoes should be large and round or oval. Overly small and irregular potatoes increase losses during processing and pose operational difficulties. (2) Potatoes should be free from disease, pests, and frost damage, and have thin skins and shallow, few eyes. Using potatoes affected by disease, pests, and frost damage to make potato chips not only results in large losses but also affects product quality.

The purpose of washing is to remove mud, dirt, and some microorganisms adhering to the surface of the potatoes. If washing is incomplete, even in small quantities, it will reduce the quality of the potato chips and accelerate the wear of machinery and equipment.

To ensure the potatoes are thoroughly washed, it is best to soak them in water for five to ten minutes before washing. After washing, it is best to rinse them once more under clean water to ensure they are even cleaner.

The purpose of grading is to reduce the loss of raw materials during processing, accelerate the processing process, and obtain high-quality potato chips.

Grading can be divided into quality grading and size grading. Quality grading of raw materials is mainly done manually. Size grading of raw materials can be done using grading sieves. Grading sieves are mainly made of wood and can simultaneously divide potatoes into three categories: large, medium, and small.

Peeling and Chopping

The outer skin of potatoes contains more cellulose, pigments, and other substances than the flesh, which can degrade the quality of the potato chips. Therefore, removing the outer skin of the potatoes can improve the quality of the potato chips, make the appearance more appealing, and increase the digestibility of the potato chips. At the same time, after the potatoes are peeled, moisture evaporates faster during the drying process.

Potatoes can be peeled manually or mechanically. Manual peeling is generally done with a special knife. Manual peeling produces slightly less waste than machine peeling, but it is slower and requires more labor. The peeling machine currently used in Shanxi is the electric peeling machine trial-produced by the Shanxi Machine Factory. This peeling machine has a production capacity of about 1,000 jin per hour.

After the potatoes are peeled, they must be cut into square strips or round slices of a certain size. The purpose of chopping is to accelerate the drying process and make the product uniform.

Potatoes can be chopped manually or mechanically. Manual chopping is done with ordinary kitchen knives or graters. Because the tools are relatively simple and crude, and the operation is manual, the speed is very slow, and the products are difficult to meet the specification requirements.

Machine chopping involves using various specially made chopping machines. There are many types of chopping machines; more than a dozen have been collected so far, among which the inclined disc slicer from Hefei, Anhui, the shredder from Wenzhou, and the electric shredder from the Shanxi Machine Factory are relatively good. These machines not only have higher production capacity, but also cut slices and shreds evenly, and are also relatively easy to operate.

Blanching

Blanching involves subjecting potatoes (chopped or whole) to a short period of heat treatment (boiling until half-cooked) in boiling water or steam, and then immediately cooling them with cold water.

The purpose of blanching is: (1) to destroy the enzymes in the potatoes to prevent the potato chips from turning black or losing their luster. (2) To maintain the natural color, aroma, and taste of the potatoes and preserve Vitamin C. (3) To accelerate the drying process of the product and reduce its water absorption, making the potato chips resistant to storage. In the past, the color of potato chips processed by farmers using traditional methods was dark or black, mainly because they were not blanched.

Before blanching, the chopped potatoes should be washed two to three times in cold water to remove the starch on the surface, so as to facilitate blanching and drying.

Blanching method: When blanching in boiling water, first pour the chopped potatoes into a tinned metal mesh basket, and then immerse them in an open pot, wooden trough, or bucket filled with boiling water for three to five minutes. To ensure uniform blanching, use a wooden paddle to stir during blanching. Well-blanched potatoes do not break when pressed by hand, but can be broken when bent; at the same time, they should have a slightly undercooked feel and taste.

The advantage of blanching in steam is that it prevents the loss of soluble nutrients in the potatoes due to leaching and avoids the washing out of starch from the chopped cells.

Regardless of how blanching is done, it must be cooled immediately after blanching to prevent the potato tissue from continuing to soften and deform. Cooling can be done in air or in cold water. Cold water can quickly cool the blanched potatoes, so it is better.

The cost of blanching is not high. According to experimental measurements, the labor and fuel costs for blanching 100 jin of potatoes are about 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. Therefore, it can be widely promoted whether it is processed by the state or by residents.

Drying

The purpose of drying is to remove moisture from the potatoes to facilitate storage and transportation.

The drying methods generally include sun-drying and oven-drying. Sun-drying involves drying the heat-treated potatoes in sunlight and air. This method has many advantages: it does not require fuel or a dryer, and it can be used in areas where conditions permit sun-drying.

Oven-drying involves drying the potatoes in a dryer or drying room. The advantage of this method is that it is not limited by season and climate, and can be dried in any season and temperature. However, it requires certain machinery and equipment, and consumes a certain amount of fuel, so the cost is higher.

During oven-drying, too high a temperature will cause the loss of nutrients and flavor in the potatoes; too low a temperature will prolong the drying time and cause the color to change. The drying temperature should be 80 to 85 degrees Celsius for potato slices and 70 to 75 degrees Celsius for potato shreds.

After the potato chips are dried, they must also be moisture-balanced, because the moisture content in the potato chips is often inconsistent, that is, some may be over-dried and some may not be dry enough; at the same time, grading and packaging must be carried out to facilitate transportation and storage.

　　怎样制作马铃薯干
    马铃薯和一般粮食不同，它的特点是水分大、皮薄，因此容易感受病害和冻伤，难于储藏、运输。
    针对马铃薯这些特点，就必须积极发展马铃薯的制干、制淀粉等加工工业。这里仅就马铃薯制干的方法加以介绍。
　　原料的选择、洗涤、分级
    要获得品质优良的薯干，减少原料的耗用量，从而降低产品成本，最主要的因素是选择适合加工要求的原料。用作加工薯干的马铃薯，一般应符合以下要求：（1）马铃薯要大而圆或椭圆。过小和不规则的马铃薯，在加工生产中要增加损耗，操作上也有困难。（2）马铃薯要没有病害、虫害和冻伤，同时表皮要薄、芽眼要浅而少。因为用受过病害、虫害和冻伤的马铃薯制作薯干时，不仅损耗量大，还会影响到产品的质量。
    洗涤的目的是在于除去马铃薯表面附着的泥沙、污物和部分微生物。如果洗涤不净，即使数量很少，也会降低薯干的质量，并加速机器设备的磨损。
    为了使马铃薯洗涤干净，在洗涤以前最好先将马铃薯放在水中浸泡五至十分钟。洗涤以后最好再放在清水下冲洗一次，以便洗得更净。
    进行分级的目的，是在于减少原料在加工时的损失，加速加工过程，并获得品质优良的薯干。
    分级可分为按品质分级和大小分级两种，原料的品质分级主要是由手工来操作的。原料大小的分级，可以采用分级筛进行。分级筛主要也是用木料制的，它可以同时把马铃薯分成大、中、小三类。
    去皮、切碎
    马铃薯的外皮含有比肉质更多的纤维素和色素等物质，这些物质能贬低薯干的质量。因此，除去马铃薯的外皮，就能提高薯干的品质，并使薯干的外貌美观，薯干的可能消化性提高。同时，马铃薯在除去了外皮以后，水分在干燥过程中的蒸发较快。
    马铃薯去皮的方法，可以采用手工去皮或机械去皮。手工去皮一般是采用专门的小刀来进行的，手工去皮所产生的废物量较用机器去皮略低，但速度较慢，耗费劳动量也较大。目前山西采用的去皮机，是山西机器厂试制的电动去皮机。这种去皮机，每小时生产能力为一千斤左右。
    马铃薯经过去皮以后，必须切成一定规格的方柱条或圆片。切碎的目的是为了加速产品的干燥过程，并使产品均匀。
    马铃薯的切碎方法可分为手工切碎和机器切碎两种。手工切碎是利用普通的菜刀、菜擦进行的。由于工具比较简单、粗糙，又系人工操作，因而速度很慢，产品难于符合规格要求。
    机器切碎，就是使用各种特制的切碎机来进行的。切碎机的种类繁多，目前搜集的就有十几种，其中以安徽合肥的斜刀盘切片机、温州的切丝机和山西机器厂的电动切丝机比较好。这几种机器不仅生产能力较高，而且片、丝切得均匀，同时操作也比较方便。
    热烫
    热烫就是把马铃薯（切碎或整个的）放在沸水或蒸汽中经过短时间的热处理（煮至半熟），而后立即用冷水冷却。
    进行热烫的目的是：（1）破坏马铃薯中的酶，以防止薯干变黑或失去光泽。（2）保持马铃薯的天然色、香、味和保存住维生素丙。（3）加速产品的干燥过程，并减少其吸水性，使薯干耐贮藏。过去农民土法加工的薯干色泽发暗或变黑，其中最主要的原因就在于没有进行热烫处理。
    在热烫前，应先把切碎的马铃薯放在冷水中洗涤二至三次，去掉表面的淀粉，以便于热烫和干燥。
    热烫的方法：在沸水中进行热烫时，先将切碎的马铃薯倒在镀锡的金属网篮里，然后浸在盛有沸水的开口锅、木槽或水桶里三至五分钟。为使热烫均匀，在热烫时可用木桨加以搅拌。热烫良好的马铃薯，用手按压时，不碎裂，但加以弯曲则可折断；同时在触觉和口味上应有点未经煮透的感觉。
    在蒸汽中热烫的好处是，可使马铃薯中的可溶性营养素不致因浸出而损失，并可避免淀粉从切碎后的细胞内洗出。
    不论怎样热烫，都必须在热烫以后立即冷却，防止马铃薯组织的继续变软和变形。冷却可以在空气内进行，也可以在冷水中进行。冷水能使热烫过的马铃薯快速冷却，因此较好。
    热烫的耗费（成本）也不大，根据试验测定，一般每热烫一百斤马铃薯的劳动耗费和燃料耗费约合人民币一角五到二角。因此无论国家加工或居民加工都可以广泛地推行。
    干燥
    进行干燥的目的是为了排出马铃薯中的水分，便于贮藏和运输。
    干燥的方法一般有晒干法和烘干法两种。晒干法，就是把热处理后的马铃薯放在日光和空气中进行干燥。这种方法有很多优点，既不需要燃料和干燥机，凡是有条件进行晒制的地区，都可以采用这种方法。
    烘干法，就是把马铃薯放在干燥机或烘干室内进行干燥。这种方法的优点，就是不受季节和气候的限制，可以在任何季节和气温下进行干制。但是它需要有一定的机器设备，要耗费一定数量的燃料，因而耗费较大。
    进行烘干时，温度过高，会使马铃薯内的营养和滋味都受到损失；温度过低，则会延长干燥的时间，色泽发生变化。进行干燥的温度，薯片应为摄氏八十度到八十五度；薯丝应为摄氏七十度到七十五度。
    薯干经过干燥以后，还必须进行水分平衡，这是因为薯干中的水分往往并不一致，即一部分可能过干，一部分也可能干燥不够；同时为了便于运输和贮藏，还必须进行分级和包装。  （山西省粮食厅）增产无止境  擎云作
