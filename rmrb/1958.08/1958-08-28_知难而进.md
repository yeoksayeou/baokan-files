　　Advancing in the Face of Difficulties
　　Wang Pu
    All things advance through the struggle of contradictions. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently mobilized its workers for a big airing of views, criticizing the "retreating in the face of difficulties" mentality of some cadres by examining the implementation of the production and construction plans for the first half of the year, and instead, "advancing in the face of difficulties." This not only ensured that the leap forward plan, which some considered "inevitably doomed," would not fail, but also proposed a more advanced target—to increase pig iron production by another 20,000 tons.
    "Advancing in the face of difficulties" is also one of the hallmarks of the communist style. All revolutionary work develops through the struggle against various difficulties. True revolutionaries should possess the fighting spirit of advancing in the face of difficulties. Whether fighting against class enemies or against the enemies of nature, when faced with difficulties, we must first despise them strategically, boosting our morale and diminishing the enemy's prestige. Only then do we value them tactically, analyze the strengths of both sides, find countermeasures, and formulate measures, before defeating them one by one and seizing the final victory.
    Difficulty and ease are opposites that can transform into each other under certain conditions. There is ease within difficulty, and difficulty within ease. Taking this year's Great Leap Forward as an example, because we aim to increase industrial and agricultural output by multiples, even several times over, compared to the annual growth of only a few percent, there may be some difficulties in the supply of equipment and raw materials, and there may be some tension in the allocation of technical personnel. However, high-speed development can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, with everyone invigorated and fighting hard, and the whole country will present a vibrant and energetic battle scene. When we fight hard for three years and overcome the difficulties on the road ahead, we will enter a new realm: both grain and steel will be greatly increased, and the material and cultural life of the people will also be greatly improved. At that time, we can be more proactive in all aspects. This is the transformation of difficulty into ease. Conversely, if we only have a small leap forward or neither leap nor advance, it may be very easy in the short term, but the result will bring great difficulties—poverty and backwardness will still bind our hands. Some workers and farmers are right to say: "We would rather fight hard than endure suffering!" Because only hard work can earn us the initiative, while enduring suffering can only leave us passive.
    People with the style of advancing in the face of difficulties are full of optimism in the face of any difficulty. This is not their blind optimism, but because they have grasped the laws of the development of things: where there is a spear, there must be a shield; where there is a difficulty, there must be a way to overcome it. All our undertakings are the undertakings of the people, and the way to overcome difficulties is to thoroughly rely on the masses. The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant proposed in the airing of views: "If the difficulty is one foot high, the enthusiasm is ten feet high." This means that the people contain endless wisdom and enthusiasm. As long as the leadership is firm and the leadership is correct, it will, like a neutron hitting an atomic nucleus, unleash immeasurable power, and no difficulty will be a problem. Countless past facts have proven this truth. The experience of many factories recently increasing their production targets again and again after mobilizing the masses has also proven this truth. Only by advancing in the face of difficulties can we progress a thousand miles a day and build socialism at high speed. This is the law of the development of things.

### 知难而进

　　知难而进
　　王朴
    一切事物都是在矛盾的斗争中前进的。石景山钢铁厂最近发动职工大鸣大放，通过检查上半年的生产和建设计划的执行情况，批判了部分干部的“知难而退”思想，来一个“知难而进”，不仅使在一些人看来“难免落空”的跃进计划不落空，而且提出了一个更先进的指标——再增产生铁两万吨。
    “知难而进”也是共产主义的风格之一。一切革命工作都是在与各种困难作斗争中发展起来的。真正的革命者都应当具有知难而进的斗争精神。与阶级敌人作斗争也好，与自然界的敌人作斗争也好，碰到困难，我们首先在战略上蔑视它，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风；其次才在战术上重视它，分析敌我双方力量，找对策，订措施，然后一个一个地战胜它们，夺取最后胜利。
    难与易是一个对立面，在一定的条件下可以互相转化。难中有易，易中有难。拿今年的大跃进来说，因为要争取工业、农业的产量成倍甚至几倍地增长，比起每年只增长百分之几来，在设备和原材料的供应方面，在技术力量的调配方面，就可能发生一些困难，各方面就可能有些紧张。但是，高速度的发展却可以把人民群众的积极性和创造性充分调动起来，人人振作，个个奋战，全国就出现一个生龙活虎般的战斗局面。当我们苦战三年，战胜了前进道路上的困难，便进入一个新的境界：粮食和钢铁都大大增加了，人民的物质和文化生活也就可能大大改善，那时我们在各方面就可以比较主动了。这就是难向易的转化。相反，要是我们只是小跃进或者既不跃也不进，这样眼前倒很轻松，可是结果会带来大困难——贫穷和落后仍然束缚着我们的手脚。有些工人和农民说得对：“宁愿苦战，不愿苦熬！”因为只有苦战才能争得主动，苦熬只能被动。
    具有知难而进的风格的人，在任何困难面前都是充满着乐观精神的。这并不是他们的盲目乐观，而是因为他们掌握了事物发展的规律：有矛必有盾，有困难必有克服困难的办法。我们的一切事业，都是人民的事业，克服困难的办法，就是彻底依靠群众。石景山钢铁厂的职工，在鸣放中提出：“困难高一尺，干劲高一丈”。这意思就是说：人民群众中蕴藏着无穷无尽的智慧和干劲，只要抓紧领导和领导得正确，它就会像中子打进原子核一样，迸发出不可估量的力量，任何困难都不在话下。过去无数的事实证明了这个真理。最近许多工厂发动群众以后一再提高增产指标的经验也证明了这个真理。只有知难而进，才能日进千里，才能高速度地建成社会主义，这就是事物发展的规律。
