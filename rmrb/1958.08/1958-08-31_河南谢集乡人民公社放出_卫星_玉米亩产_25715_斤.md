Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 30th. The Yudong sandy area, once known as a low-yield area, has continuously released high-yield "satellites" for autumn crops. Here, the Xiejixiang People's Commune in Shangqiu County, after creating a high-yield record of 22,489 jin per mu of corn, now has 1.124 mu of corn actually yielding 28,903 jin and 12 liang. The average yield per mu is 25,715 jin and 1 liang.

This cornfield was cultivated by Wang Deyu and Liu Hongtang, the Party Branch Secretaries, Zhang Xingtian, the Deputy Secretary, Wang Yunzhi, the Brigade Leader, and Li Ruyi, the Director of the Experimental Farm, of the Peace Third Brigade of the Second Management Area of the commune. The corn stalks are eight chi tall, with each stalk bearing about fifteen ears. At harvest time, the brigade organized 558 people, and it took three days to complete the harvesting and threshing. Gai Liangbi, Standing Committee Member of the Shangqiu Prefectural Party Committee and First Deputy Commissioner of the Administrative Office, heads of county, township, and commune Party and League organizations, and dozens of commune member representatives from the Youth Experimental Farm Rocket Brigade all participated in the inspection, weighing, and land measurement work.

This experimental field was deeply ploughed three times before sowing. The first ploughing was three and a half chi deep, the second was one and a half chi, and the third was one chi. In conjunction with ploughing, 250,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied in layers, and the field was harrowed twenty times. Sowing took place before the Qingming Festival, with 16 jin of "Golden Queen" seeds sown per mu. There were more than 9,800 seedlings per mu. In terms of seedling management, advanced technical measures such as five applications of fertilizer, seven irrigations, and multiple weedings, pest control, and artificial pollination were adopted.

　　河南谢集乡人民公社放出“卫星”
    玉米亩产25715斤
    新华社郑州30日电　一向被人们称为低产地带的豫东沙区，连续放出秋季作物丰产“卫星”。这里的商丘县谢集乡人民公社在创造玉米亩产二万二千四百八十九斤的高额丰产纪录之后，现在又有一亩一分二厘四毫玉米实收二万八千九百零三斤十二两。平均亩产二万五千七百一十五斤一两。
    这块玉米田是公社第二管理区和平第三大队党支部书记王德育、刘洪堂，副书记张兴田，大队长王云志，试验场场长李如意等培育的。玉米株高八尺，每株约结棒十五个左右。收的时候，大队组织了五百五十八人，三天才收打完毕。中共商丘地委常委、专署第一副专员盖良弼，县、乡、社党团组织的负责人以及青年试验场火箭大队的几十位社员代表，都参加了验收、过秤和丈量土地工作。
    这块试验田在播种前深翻了三次。第一次深翻三尺半，第二次一尺半，第三次一尺。结合翻地，分层施入底肥二十五万斤，耙二十遍。清明节前播种，每亩下种“金皇后”十六斤。每亩定苗九千八百多株。在苗期管理上，采取了五肥、七水和多次除草、治虫、人工授粉等先进技术措施。
