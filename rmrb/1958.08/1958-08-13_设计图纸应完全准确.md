　　Design Drawings Should Be Completely Accurate
    Recently, our factory constructed a three-cubic-meter small blast furnace according to the design drawings from the Black Metallurgical Design Institute. The refractory bricks were also manufactured according to the design requirements. The original design specified that the inner diameter of the bosh of the small blast furnace should be 1.05 meters at its widest point. However, after we arranged the refractory bricks, we discovered that the inner diameter of the furnace circle was as much as 1.8 meters, which did not conform to the original design specifications. After checking, it was proven that the dimensions of the refractory bricks were incorrectly calculated on the drawings. Therefore, we had to process and grind down more than three thousand refractory bricks, with the most extreme cases requiring grinding down by thirty-eight millimeters. This would require more than four hundred workdays to complete. This not only caused a waste of manpower and materials but also affected the progress of the project.
    We hope that the Black Metallurgical Design Institute will investigate this matter.

### 设计图纸应完全准确

　　设计图纸应完全准确
    最近，我厂根据黑色冶金设计总院设计的图纸，建设一座三立方公尺的小高炉。耐火砖也是按照设计要求制造的。原设计中规定小高炉的炉腹内径最粗部分是一点零五公尺，但我们把耐火砖摆起来以后，发现炉的圆圈内径竟达一点八公尺之多，不符合原设计规定。经过查对证明，是图纸上对耐火砖的尺寸计算错了。因此，我们必须把三千多块耐火砖全部加工磨小，最多的要磨去三十八公厘，需要四百多个工日才能磨完。这样，不仅造成人力和物力的浪费，同时也影响工程进度。
    希望黑色冶金设计总院对这件事情检查一下。
