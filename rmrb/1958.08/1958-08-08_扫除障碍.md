Clearing Obstacles
    Striving for high speed is a key issue in industrial construction. After more than half a year of effort, generally speaking, industry in various regions has greatly developed. However, upon careful inspection, the industrial development speed in some regions still needs to be further accelerated.

    Currently, a significant obstacle to accelerating construction speed is the ideology of "emphasizing the foreign and belittling the indigenous." Wherever this ideology exists, the speed appears slow. Therefore, to accelerate construction speed, it is necessary to wage a serious struggle against the "emphasizing the foreign and belittling the indigenous" ideology and resolutely implement the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, prioritizing indigenous methods."

    The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly summarized its experience and used facts to educate cadres: "Emphasizing the foreign and belittling the indigenous" inevitably leads to less, slower, worse, and more expensive outcomes, while "giving equal importance to indigenous and foreign" will certainly lead to more, faster, better, and more economical results. This is a struggle between two construction guidelines: less, slower, worse, and more expensive versus more, faster, better, and more economical. To effectively implement the General Line, this struggle must be resolutely carried out.

    扫除障碍
    力争高速度，是工业建设的关键问题。经过半年多的努力，一般说来，各地工业都有了很大的发展。但是，切实检查一下，有的地区的工业发展速度还需要进一步加快。
    目前，加快建设速度的一个重要障碍，是“重洋轻土”思想。哪里有了这种思想哪里的速度就显得缓慢。因此，要加快建设速度，需要对“重洋轻土”思想进行严肃的斗争，坚决贯彻执行“土洋结合，先土后洋”的方针。
    中共青海省委及时地总结经验，拿事实教育干部：“重洋轻土”，必然带来少慢差费，而“土洋并举”，就一定多快好省。这是少慢差费和多快好省两种建设方针的斗争。要切实贯彻执行总路线，就必须坚决进行这种斗争。
