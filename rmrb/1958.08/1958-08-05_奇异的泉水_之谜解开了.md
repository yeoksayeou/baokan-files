Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, August 4th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Bai Shulian): Since this agency reported the news of the "Strange Spring" on May 13th, the leading organs of the Hulunbuir League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have successively received many letters from all over the country, inquiring about the address of the spring, its medical efficacy, and whether it is for sale. Some patients even requested to come for treatment. Therefore, the director of the Hulunbuir League People's Hospital led pharmacists and others to the source of the "Strange Spring" in early July for more than ten days of testing and research. After initially determining the composition of the spring water, they took it to the Harbin Municipal Drug Inspection and Research Institute for further testing. Now, the mystery of this "Strange Spring" has been solved. After testing, it has been proven to be a mixed spring of carbonated spring and ferrous carbonate spring. Every 100 milliliters of spring water contains: 159.6 milligrams of carbon dioxide, 42.12 milligrams of acidic carbonate, 2.463 milligrams of iron, and trace amounts of calcium salts, sulfates, magnesium salts, phosphates, etc. It can treat more than ten diseases such as stomach ailments, emphysema, nephritis, anemia, and post-illness weakness. However, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and peptic ulcers are prohibited from taking it.

According to a survey by the League People's Hospital, Su Yongsheng, an emphysema patient, had been unable to work for more than 20 years but recovered after taking the spring water. Bai Lama, a stomach patient, suffered from abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and loss of appetite but after treatment with the spring water, he could eat three or four bowls of rice per meal, and his physical strength greatly increased. Currently, the hospital is conducting clinical trials.

At the same time, the "Strange Spring" has entered the commodity market. The Hulunbuir League Pharmaceutical Company is preparing to build a spring water processing plant at its source to meet the needs of patients.

    “奇异的泉水”之谜解开了
    据新华社海拉尔4日电　新华社记者白树廉报道：自从本社5月13日报道了“奇异的泉水”这一消息后，内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟的领导机关陆续收到全国各地很多来信，询问泉水的地址、医疗效能以及是否出售等问题。有一些患者并要求前来治病。于是，呼伦贝尔盟人民医院院长便带领药师等人，在7月初到“奇异的泉水”的发源地，进行了为时十多天的化验研究。他们在初步确定泉水的成分以后，又拿到哈尔滨市药品检研所再次进行化验。现在，这一眼“奇异的泉水”之谜已经解开了。经过化验证明，它是碳酸泉和碳酸铁泉的混合泉。每一百毫升泉水中含有：二氧化碳一五九·六毫克，酸性碳酸盐四二·一二毫克，铁二·四六三毫克，还含有微量的钙盐、硫酸盐、镁盐、磷酸盐等。能治疗胃病、肺气肿、肾炎、贫血、病后虚弱等十多种疾病。但肺结核、消化性溃疡等病患者禁忌服用。
    据盟人民医院调查，肺气肿患者苏永生二十多年不能劳动，服用泉水后痊愈。胃病患者白喇嘛腹疼腹胀、食欲减退，用泉水治疗后每餐能吃三四碗饭，体力大大增强。目前，这个医院正在进行临床试验。
    同时，“奇异的泉水”已经进入了商品市场。呼伦贝尔盟医药公司，正准备在它的发源地兴建一座泉水加工厂，来满足患者的需要。
