Overcoming Difficulties Through Contempt for Difficulty
—A Commentary by Our Newspaper Reporter on Mianyang's Creation of a Great Harvest in a Disaster Year

Hankou, August 8th (Report from our newspaper) Our reporter commented on the miracle of Mianyang County achieving a high-yield harvest in a year of great disaster, saying: In April and May of this year, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, suffered a particularly severe natural disaster. It began with hurricane-force winds and hailstorms, almost like a myth, uprooting century-old trees and blowing children away. This was followed by torrential rains, with 276 millimeters of rainfall in a single day and night. Then came more than twenty consecutive days of continuous rain, with rainfall reaching 647 millimeters. Everywhere was a vast expanse of water, and many water conservancy projects were destroyed. In the midst of these disastrous days, a cold wave struck again on May 10th, freezing more than 70% of the 540,000 mu of cotton seedlings and some rice seedlings that had not been flooded. However, despite the severity of the disaster, people overcame it in a month or two: they drained waterlogged areas, built dikes, replanted various crops, ensuring the planted area; they implemented measures such as deep plowing, close planting, and applying sufficient base fertilizer, strengthening field management. This ensured the healthy growth of various crops. Now, more than 80,000 mu of early rice in the county has been harvested, with an average yield of 1,018 jin per mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to the 400 jin per mu in the good weather year of 1957. Many examples of high-yield harvests have emerged. Now people are full of confidence in striving to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in the fall.

This matter has attracted close attention: Why, when the county suffered such a severe natural disaster, could it be overcome in just a month or two, enabling the county's early rice yield to exceed 1,000 jin per mu and still strive to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in the fall?

Let the facts answer the question. When the county suffered the disaster, people's thoughts were very confused. Proponents of objective conditions and conservatives argued plausibly: "The disaster is a foregone conclusion, the difficulties cannot be overcome, and everyone should find their own way out. This way, you can't blame me for being right-leaning; blame the heavens for not being merciful." They advocated reducing the replanted area for various crops and lowering the production plans for various crops. At this crucial juncture, would the county party committee lead the masses in a tenacious battle against the disaster, or would it let things take their course and succumb to the disaster? That is to say, would the county party committee muster all its energy and strive for the top, or would it retreat in the face of difficulties and admit defeat? Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the county party committee chose the first path. They knew that there were many difficulties in overcoming the disaster, but they believed that if they dared to despise difficulties, they would definitely be able to overcome them. Because overcoming difficulties is not determined by the heavens, but by people—determined by the great strength of the millions of working people who are organized and tempered by the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement. Because the county party committee emancipated its mind, their enthusiasm soared, and they sounded the bugle call for disaster relief and increased production to the people of the county, proposing the heroic slogan of "Ensuring planning is like protecting our lives, and not收兵 until the disaster is overcome," organizing an army of 200,000 people for disaster relief, launching a struggle to protect the plan through disaster relief, and finally achieving victory in the disaster relief struggle.

The experience of the disaster relief struggle tells us that as long as we highly develop subjective initiative, unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions, and bad things can be turned into good things.

The experience of the disaster relief struggle also tells people that while a great leap forward can certainly be carried out in normal years, it can also be carried out in years of particularly severe natural disasters. Proponents of objective conditions and conservatives always regard the difficulties caused by disasters as unchangeable. Of course, they cannot understand that heroic people can create great miracles of disaster relief and increased production.

    藐视困难就能战胜困难
    ——本报记者对沔阳创造灾年大丰收的评述
    本报汉口8日电  记者评述沔阳县创造大灾之年获得高额丰产的奇迹称：今年4、5月间湖北沔阳县遭受了特大的自然灾害。开始是狂风和冰雹，简直像神话一般，将百年大树连根拔掉，小孩被吹得失了踪。接着是倾盆大雨，一天一夜降雨二百七十六公厘。后来又阴雨连绵二十多天，降雨量达六百四十七公厘。到处是一片汪洋，许多水利工程被冲毁。就在这个灾难的日子里，5月10日又来了一次寒潮，将没有受淹的五十四万亩棉苗和一部分秧苗冻死70％以上。可是，尽管灾情这样严重，人们在一两个月之间把它战胜了：他们排除渍水、修筑堤防，补种各种作物，保证种植面积；贯彻了深耕密植、施足底肥等措施，加强了田间管理。保证各种农物生长良好。现在全县八万多亩早稻已经收获，平均亩产一千零十八斤，比风调雨顺的1957年亩产四百斤增加了一倍半，还出现许多高额丰产典型。现在人们满怀信心地争取实现秋季全面大丰收。
    这件事情，引起人们密切注意：为什么全县遭受这样特大的自然灾害，却在短短的一两个月之间把它战胜、使全县的早稻亩产突破千斤并且还要争取实现秋收全面大丰收的规划？
    问题还是让事实来回答吧。当全县遭受灾害的时候，人们的思想很混乱。条件论者和保守主义者振振有词地说：“灾情已定局，困难无法战胜，只有各自找门路，这样不怪我右倾，只怪老天不留情。”他们主张缩小各种作物的补种面积，降低各种作物的生产计划。处在这个重要关头，县委领导群众和灾害顽强战斗呢，还是放任自流屈服于灾害呢？就是说，县委是鼓足干劲，力争上游呢，还是遇难而退，甘败下风？在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，县委选择了第一条道路。他们知道，战胜灾害，困难是很多的，但是他们相信，如果敢于藐视困难就一定能战胜困难。因为战胜困难不决定于天老爷，而是决定于人——决定于组织起来的，经过反右派斗争和整风运动锻炼的千百万劳动人民的伟大力量。由于县委解放了思想，他们干劲冲天，向全县人民吹起了抗灾增产的号角，提出“确保规划如保命，抗灾不胜不收兵”的豪迈口号，组织了二十万人的抗灾大军，开展了抗灾保规划的斗争，终于取得了抗灾斗争的胜利。
    抗灾斗争的经验告诉我们，只要高度发挥主观能动性，不利的条件可变为有利条件，坏事可以变成好事。
    抗灾斗争的经验也告诉人们，在正常年景固然可以进行大跃进，但是在遭受特大自然灾害的年景也同样可以进行大跃进。条件论者和保守主义者，总是把灾害所造成的困难看作是无法改变的，当然，他们就是无法了解英雄的人民可以创造抗灾增产的大奇迹。
