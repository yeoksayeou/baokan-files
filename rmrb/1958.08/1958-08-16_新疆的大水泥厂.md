　　Xinjiang's Large Cement Plant
　　The first modern cement plant in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was basically completed in early August and has been put into production, three months ahead of schedule.
　　The originally planned annual output of this cement plant was 150,000 tons. After full discussion by the workers and tapping the potential of the equipment, the cement output was increased to 270,000 to 300,000 tons without adding equipment.
　　The commissioning of this cement plant will fully meet the oil well cement required by Xinjiang's petroleum industry. (Attached picture)

　  新疆的大水泥厂
    新疆维吾尔自治区第一座现代化水泥厂在8月初基本建成，并已投入生产，比原计划提前了三个月。
    这座水泥厂原计划的年产量是十五万吨。经过工人充分讨论，挖掘了设备潜力，在不增加设备的情况下，把水泥产量提高到二十七万至三十万吨。
    这个水泥厂的投入生产，将充分满足新疆石油工业所需要的油井水泥。（附图片）
