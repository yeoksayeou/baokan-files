Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, August 12th: Thirty thousand people from all walks of life in Xiamen held demonstrations on water and land on the afternoon of the 10th, resolutely demanding the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. and British aggressor troops from the Middle East, and strongly protesting against the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek's creation of tension in the Taiwan Strait.

　　At more than 3:00 pm that day, more than 2,000 sailors, fishermen, and nautical club athletes, aboard ships, sailboats, and sampans, set off from the First Wharf and held a demonstration parade in the Xiamen Strait. At the same time, another contingent of more than 20,000 workers, farmers, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, students, and militiamen from frontline villages carrying machine guns and rifles, as well as people from other walks of life, held a demonstration parade in the urban area. Xiao Feng, Secretary of the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhang Chukun and Xu Zuyi, Deputy Mayors of Xiamen, and other party and government leaders also participated in the parade. The participants were in high spirits, constantly shouting slogans such as "U.S. and British aggressor troops get out of the Middle East!" and "U.S. aggressor troops get out of our Taiwan!"

　　The charts and models held high by the people showed the determination of the people of Xiamen to defend peace with practical actions. Since the launch of the "Support the Middle East People's Production Month Movement," the steel output of the steel workers of the Xiamen General Machinery Factory has increased by more than 70% compared with the end of last month. The youths of Hecuo Township, which faces Jinmen Island across the sea, are determined to work hard to increase grain production in order to strengthen the country's strength in defending peace.

　　In the past half month, more than 170,000 people in Xiamen have signed their names to oppose the crimes of U.S. and British imperialism in invading the Middle East. Citizens have also unanimously expressed their readiness to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan at any time.

　　厦门市三万人举行水陆大游行
    新华社厦门12日电　厦门市各界人民三万多人10日下午分别在水上和陆上举行示威游行，坚决要求美英侵略军立即从中东撤出去，并强烈抗议美蒋在台湾海峡制造紧张局势。
    当天下午三点多钟，分别乘着轮船、帆船和舢舨的两千多名海员、渔民和航海俱乐部运动员们，从第一码头出发，在厦门海峡举行示威游行。同时，另一支由两万多名工人、农民、归国华侨、侨眷、学生和来自前沿村庄的扛着机关枪、步枪的民兵，以及其他各阶层人民，在市区举行了示威游行。中共厦门市委书记萧枫，厦门市副市长张楚琨、许祖义等党政负责人也参加了这支游行队伍。参加游行的人们情绪激昂，不断高呼“美英侵略军从中东滚出去！”“美国侵略军从我国的台湾滚出去！”等口号。
    人们高举着的图表和模型，显示了厦门市人民以实际行动保卫和平的决心。厦门通用机器厂炼钢工人从开展“声援中东人民生产月运动”以来，每日的钢产量已比上月底增加了70％以上。同金门岛隔海相望的何厝乡的青年们，决心努力增产粮食，以增强祖国保卫和平的力量。
    最近半个月以来，厦门市已有十七万多人签名反对美英帝国主义侵略中东的罪行。市民们还一致表示，随时准备支援人民解放军解放台湾。
