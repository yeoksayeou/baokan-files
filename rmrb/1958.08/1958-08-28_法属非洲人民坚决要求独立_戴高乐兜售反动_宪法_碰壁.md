The People of French Africa Firmly Demand Independence
De Gaulle's Reactionary "Constitution" Runs into Snags

　　10,000-Mile “Journey”
　　De Gaulle is currently on a 10,000-mile "journey" through French territories in Africa. After visiting Madagascar, Equatorial Africa, Ivory Coast, and Conakry, the capital of French Guinea, he arrived in Dakar, Senegal, in French West Africa, on the 26th.

　　Peddling a "Constitution"
　　What is the purpose of De Gaulle's trip to Africa? He is going to French Africa to peddle his new "Constitution." This "Constitution" has two purposes: domestically, to maintain reactionary rule by weakening parliamentary democracy and establishing personal dictatorship; in overseas territories, to alleviate the tide of national independence movements and save the collapse of the colonial system by creating a "Federation" swindle.

　　Setting Up a Swindle
　　In his speeches in French Africa, De Gaulle greatly touted the Franco-African "Federation" stipulated in his draft "Constitution," calling it a "new dawn" and saying that the relationship between France and its overseas territories had entered a "new era." However, this "Federation," dressed up with beautiful lies, only allows French overseas territories some formal "local autonomy." As for important powers such as national defense, diplomacy, economy, justice, education, and transportation, they are still controlled by the French government.

　　Also Threatening
　　De Gaulle knows that the "Federation" swindle alone cannot make the people of African territories give up their demands for independence. Therefore, he pretends to say that these countries are free to choose independence, but then immediately threatens that independence means "separation," which will mean bearing the "dangers" and "disasters" of doing so in isolation. At the same time, De Gaulle also uses the approval or rejection of his dictatorial "Constitution" draft as a sign of whether or not they are willing to join the "Federation."

　　In a speech in Brazzaville, Equatorial Africa, De Gaulle also uniquely found a new excuse to intimidate, which is the so-called "great danger from Asia." He implied that the slogan of "independence" would open the door wide for "aggression" from Asia.

　　Unfavorable Start
　　Despite these tactics, De Gaulle has not achieved the desired results. He got off to an unfavorable start when he first arrived in Madagascar. The Standing Committee of the Congress of Independence, a joint organization of Madagascar's major political parties, issued a statement before De Gaulle arrived, saying that the draft constitutional amendment submitted by the French government to the Constitutional Advisory Committee was completely incompatible with Madagascar's desire for independence, and Madagascar could not accept any other solution except for free negotiations.

　　Another Rebuff
　　In French Guinea, De Gaulle was rebuffed again. Guinean Prime Minister Sékou Touré issued a statement on August 10, saying that if De Gaulle's constitution did not specifically mention the right to self-determination and independence, Guinea would oppose the plan. On the day of De Gaulle's arrival, Sékou Touré once again declared that the people of Guinea insisted on their demand for independence.

　　The leaders of the three political parties in French Equatorial Africa, the "African Unity Party," the "African Socialist Movement," and the "Black African Social Evolution Movement," also issued a joint statement requesting that the French government include clauses in the constitution recognizing the independence of overseas territories, guaranteeing that these territories could become independent as long as there was a unilateral decision by the local parliament and local government, without the need for French consent.

　　Raging Tide
　　In Senegal, the mass movement against De Gaulle's constitution has formed a raging tide. On August 17, the people of Senegal held large-scale demonstrations and mass rallies in Dakar to oppose De Gaulle's new "Constitution." Despite the French colonial authorities' police throwing tear gas, the demonstrators still shouted slogans such as "Down with De Gaulle" and "Long Live Independence." In this conflict, some African police officers even joined the ranks of the demonstrators.

　　When De Gaulle arrived in Dakar, he was greeted by a loud cry for "Independence!" from the African people. Transportation workers, sanitation workers, and workers in other urban services in Dakar are on strike. Along the road from the suburban airport to the city center that De Gaulle's car must pass, there are vast demonstration teams. People held flags and banners with eye-catching words such as "Immediate Independence" and "De Gaulle Get Out," shouting slogans such as "Independence!" and "This land is ours!" The demonstrators also threw a large bundle of leaflets into De Gaulle's car.

　　Hopes Dashed
　　De Gaulle's "journey" is about to end. It seems that he has put in a lot of effort, but his hopes have been dashed. As the progressive African newspapers have pointed out, the greatest threat to African independence does not come from elsewhere, but precisely from colonial countries like France, which greedily plunder the wealth of African countries, insist on carrying out colonial wars, and bloodily suppress the Algerian national liberation movement and the patriotic and democratic forces of other African countries. The African people know how to distinguish between true friends and vicious, brutal exploiters. De Gaulle's beautiful lies and vicious threats cannot dispel the African people's desire for independence. (Comprehensive report by this newspaper)

### 法属非洲人民坚决要求独立  戴高乐兜售反动“宪法”碰壁

　　法属非洲人民坚决要求独立
    戴高乐兜售反动“宪法”碰壁
　　万里“旅行”
    戴高乐正在非洲法国各属地进行一万英里的“旅行”。他去过马达加斯加、赤道非洲、象牙海岸和法属几内亚首府科纳里克以后，在26日又到了法属西非塞内加尔的达喀尔。
　　兜售“宪法”
    戴高乐这次到非洲去旅行是为了什么呢？他是要向法属非洲人民去兜售他的新“宪法”。这个“宪法”有两方面的目的：在国内，用削弱议会民主、建立个人独裁的办法，来维持国内的反动统治；在海外属地，用建立“联合邦”的骗局，来缓和民族独立运动的浪潮，挽救殖民制度的崩溃。
　　既设骗局
    戴高乐在法属非洲各地发表讲话时，大大吹嘘他在“宪法”草案中规定的法—非“联合邦”，把它说成是什么“新出现的曙光”，又说什么今后法国同它的海外属地的关系到了一个“新的时期”。但是，这个用各种美丽的谎言所打扮起来的“联合邦”，不过是让法国的海外属地有若干形式上的所谓“地方自治”而已。至于国防、外交、经济、司法、教育、交通运输等重要权力仍然由法国政府掌握。
　　又施威胁
    戴高乐知道，光是“联合邦”的骗局是不能使非洲属地人民放弃独立要求的。因此，他又假惺惺地说，这些国家可以自由选择独立，但是，紧接着他就威胁说，独立就是“分离”，这就要孤立地承担这样做的“危险”和“灾难”。同时，戴高乐还把赞成或者拒绝他的独裁“宪法”草案作为愿意不愿意参加“联合邦”的标志。
    在赤道非洲的布拉柴维尔发表讲话时，戴高乐还别开生面地找出一个新的借口来进行恫吓，这就是所谓“来自亚洲的巨大危险”。他暗示，“独立”的口号将为来自亚洲的“侵略”大开方便之门。
　　出门不利
    尽管戴高乐采取这些手法，但是并没有收到效果。他首先到马达加斯加就出门不利。马达加斯加的各主要政党的联合组织——独立代表大会的常设委员会，在戴高乐来到以前就发表声明说：法国政府向宪法谘询委员会提出的宪法修正草案同马达加斯加要求独立的愿望毫不相符，马达加斯加不能接受除了进行自由谈判以外的任何其他解决办法。
　　再碰钉子
    在法属几内亚，戴高乐又碰了钉子，几内亚总理塞古·杜尔在8月10日就发表声明说：如果戴高乐的宪法不具体地提到自决和独立的权利，那末，几内亚将反对这个计划。在戴高乐到达的那天，塞古·杜尔再一次声明，几内亚人民坚持独立的要求。
    法属赤道非洲的“非洲联合党”、“非洲社会主义运动”、“黑非洲社会进化运动”等三个政党的领袖也发表了一篇联合声明，要求法国政府在宪法中列入承认海外属地独立的条款，保障这些属地只要有地方议会和地方政府的单方面的决定，而不需要经过法国同意，就可以独立。
　　怒潮汹涌
    在塞内加尔，反对戴高乐宪法的群众运动更形成了一个汹涌怒潮。8月17日，塞内加尔的人民在达喀尔举行了大规模示威游行和群众集会，反对戴高乐的新“宪法”。尽管法国殖民当局的警察投掷了催泪瓦斯弹，游行者仍高呼“打倒戴高乐”、“独立万岁”等口号。在这场冲突中，某些非洲籍警察甚至参加了示威者的行列。
    当戴高乐到达达喀尔时，迎接他的是非洲人民一片响亮的呼声：“独立！”达喀尔的交通运输工人、清洁工人及其他一些城市服务事业的工人正在举行罢工。沿着戴高乐的汽车从市郊飞机场进城必经的道路，尽是浩浩荡荡的示威队伍。人们打着旗帜和标语牌，上面写上“立即独立”、“戴高乐滚出去”等耀眼的字句，高呼“独立！”和“这片土地是我们的！”等口号。示威者还把一大捆传单扔进戴高乐的汽车里去。
　　希望落空
    戴高乐的“旅行”马上要结束了。看来，他煞费心机，结果他的希望是落空了。正如非洲的进步报纸所指出的，对非洲人民独立的巨大威胁并不是来自别处，而恰恰是来自像法国那样的一些殖民国家，它们贪婪地掠夺非洲国家的财富，执意进行殖民战争，血腥地镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动及其他非洲国家的爱国民主力量。非洲人民是懂得把真正的朋友和凶恶、残暴的剥削者区别开来的。戴高乐漂亮的谎话和狠毒的恫吓都不能打消非洲人民要求独立的心愿。　　（本报综合报道）
