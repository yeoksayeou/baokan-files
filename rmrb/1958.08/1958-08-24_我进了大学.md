　　I Entered University
　　Jiang Wenzhi, Student of Red Flag University, Yongfengtun Township
    For peasants to attend university was something I wouldn't have dared to dream of in the past; but today, I have truly become a student of the Red Flag University established by our township!
    Our school started on the afternoon of June 20th. That day, I was especially happy. After lunch, I went to the school with great excitement. Although the opening ceremony did not finish until very late, and it was already late at night when I returned home; lying in bed, I was still so excited that I couldn't fall asleep for a long time.
    The first class was a study of the report by Cui Xiyan, the head of the Yingju Cooperative in Henan. This first lesson gave me great education and inspiration. When I first started school, I was still worried because I was working in the township and things were relatively busy. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the studies. After studying the report, my worries disappeared. "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." The Yingju Cooperative was able to overcome many difficulties and completely change its face. What difficulty is there that I cannot overcome? So, I felt a hundred times more courageous and full of confidence. I am determined to work hard, study hard, and become a university student who is both red and expert, a new peasant with political consciousness and culture.

　　我进了大学
　　永丰屯乡红旗大学学生　蒋文治
    农民上大学，这是过去做梦也不敢想的事情；但是今天，我却真的成了我们乡举办的红旗大学的学生了！
    我们的学校是在6月20日下午开学的。那天，我特别高兴，吃罢午饭，便兴冲冲地朝学校走去了。虽然开学典礼很久才完，回到家里已经是深夜了；但是躺在床上，我仍然兴奋得很久不能入睡。
    第一次上课是学习河南应举社社长崔希彦的报告，这第一课，便给了我很大的教育和启发。最初上学的时候，我心里还有顾虑，因为自己在乡里工作，事情比较忙，害怕学习赶不上，学了报告以后，我的顾虑消除了。“世上无难事，只怕有心人”，应举社能够克服重重困难，彻底改变面貌，我这个小小困难，有什么不能克服呢？于是我觉得勇气百倍，信心十足了。我下定决心，一定努力工作，好好学习，成为一个又红又专的大学生，成为一个有政治觉悟、有文化的新农民。
