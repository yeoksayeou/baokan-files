　　Revolutionary Work Must Also Be Done in Government Offices
　　Li Yan
    The revolutionary upsurge is sweeping the country, and the technical revolution and the cultural revolution are the two mainstreams of this upsurge. This sharply raises a question: Should state organs carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution? Can technical revolution and cultural revolution be carried out? Faced with this question, the majority are supporters, but there are still a few who are doubters. Such as "Government offices are different from factories and rural areas, they have their own particularities!" "There isn't much to gain from carrying out technical revolution and cultural revolution in government offices!" and so on, are the basis for the doubters' doubts. Now, that's good, please doubters look at the absolutely undeniable facts in the report on the Ministry of Foreign Trade. These facts so accurately, clearly, and vividly prove that state organs can and must carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution, and that carrying out this revolution is not "not much to gain," but "there's a lot to gain."
    State organs do have their own particularities, and they are indeed very different from factories and rural areas, this is one aspect. However, it is also necessary to see another aspect, state organs are departments that specifically lead industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings. Not only do they themselves have the task of technical revolution and cultural revolution, but the quality of their technical revolution and cultural revolution will have direct or indirect unimaginable influence on the technical revolution and cultural revolution of industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings throughout the country. The whole country is carrying out technical revolution and cultural revolution, can state organs that directly or indirectly bear the responsibility of leading and guiding technical revolution and cultural revolution stay where they are?
    Of course, in some state organs, there is indeed a considerable part of the work that cannot be included in the scope of technical revolution and cultural revolution, then can it be said that this work can be non-revolutionary? The answer is no. Technical revolution and cultural revolution are the central task and key task of our country's current revolution. Grasping it can quickly change our country's backward state of "poverty and blankness." But this does not mean that our other work can continue as before, and can be non-revolutionary. On the contrary, the rapid development of technical revolution and cultural revolution, and the rapid advancement of the entire country, require all work to develop and advance rapidly accordingly. That is to say, all work must be revolutionary. Therefore, we must not get caught up in the question of whether a certain work belongs to the scope of technical revolution and cultural revolution, but must adopt a thorough revolutionary attitude and revolutionize whatever work we do. From the regulations and systems and working methods of the government offices, to all administrative work, we must improve them all at a revolutionary speed in order to adapt to the requirements of the entire technical revolution and cultural revolution. This is actually participating in the ranks of technical revolution and cultural revolution.
    Technical revolution and cultural revolution are the guiding principle for promoting the work of state organs. Grasping this guiding principle tightly can raise the work of the entire state organs to a new level. All "special case theories" and "exceptionalism" are untenable on the issue of the need for revolutionary work in government offices.

　　机关工作也要革命
　　黎言
    革命高潮，席卷全国，技术革命和文化革命便是这一高潮的两股主流；这就尖锐地提出一个问题：国家机关要不要进行技术革命和文化革命？能不能进行技术革命和文化革命？在这个问题面前，多数人是拥护者，可是还有少数人是怀疑者。诸如“机关和工厂、农村不同，有它的特殊性呀！”“机关中进行技术革命和文化革命油水不大呀！”之类，就是怀疑论者怀疑的根据。现在好了，请怀疑论者看看关于对外贸易部的报道中丝毫不容怀疑的事实，这些事实，如此准确、鲜明、生动地证明：国家机关能够进行而且必须进行技术革命和文化革命，进行这一革命不是“油水不大”，而是“大有油水”。
    国家机关的确有它的特殊性，的确和工厂、农村大不相同，这是一方面。可是，也还要看到另一方面，国家机关是具体领导工农业生产和文化教育事业的部门，不但他们本身就有技术革命和文化革命的任务，而且他们的技术革命和文化革命进行的好坏，对全国的工农业生产和文化教育事业的技术革命和文化革命会产生直接或间接不可想像的影响。举国上下都在进行技术革命和文化革命，难道直接、间接负有领导和指导技术革命和文化革命的国家机关倒可以原地不动吗？
    当然，在有些国家机关中，的确有相当一部分工作，不能包括在技术革命和文化革命的范围之内，那么能不能说，这些工作可以不革命呢？答复是不能。技术革命和文化革命是我国当前革命的中心任务和关键任务，抓住了它，就可以迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的落后面貌。但这并不是说我们其他的工作可以照老样子走路，可以不革命。恰恰相反，技术革命和文化革命的迅速发展，整个国家的飞跃前进，要求一切工作都要相应的迅速发展和飞跃前进。也就是要求一切工作都要革命，因此，我们千万不要去钻某种工作属不属技术革命和文化革命范围这样的牛角尖，而要采取彻底革命的态度，干什么工作革什么命。从机关的规章制度、工作方法，直到一切事务性的工作，都要以革命的速度全盘加以改进，才能适应整个技术革命和文化革命的要求，这实际上就是参加了技术革命和文化革命的行列。
    技术革命和文化革命是推动国家机关工作的一条纲，紧紧抓住这条纲，就可以把整个国家机关的工作提高到新的水平。在机关工作需要革命的问题上一切“特殊论”和“例外论”都是站不住脚的。
