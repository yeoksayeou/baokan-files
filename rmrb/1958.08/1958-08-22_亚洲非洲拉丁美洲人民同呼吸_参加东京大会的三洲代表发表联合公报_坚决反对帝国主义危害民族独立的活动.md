　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. The secretariat of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament announced today the joint communiqué of the Asian, African, and Latin American delegations.

　　The joint communiqué stated that we recognize that the peoples of the countries in these two regions are facing a common danger from military treaties. We have decided to mobilize public opinion against imperialism continuing its activities of suppressing the principle of self-determination of peoples of all countries and endangering their political and economic independence. The joint communiqué said that we believe that the resolution of the common problems of the two regions will certainly promote international cooperation in the movement against nuclear weapons and for disarmament.

　　The joint communiqué also advocated promoting economic and cultural exchanges between the peoples of the countries in these two regions.

　　The joint communiqué said that we hope that the Latin American conference scheduled to be held in Buenos Aires in April 1959 will discuss the following points: (1) Economic development, (2) National sovereignty, (3) Disarmament and international cooperation. We hope that the peoples of Asian and African countries will send delegations to participate in this conference.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th. The plenary session of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament adopted the appeal passed by the youth panel on the 19th, calling on young people of all countries to promote the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and to safeguard world peace.

　　The appeal pointed out that the actions that young people all over the world should take immediately are: (1) Launch a movement in all villages, towns, and workplaces to demand that the United States and the United Kingdom immediately and unconditionally stop nuclear testing, protest to the U.S. and British governments, and send signatures and resolutions to the U.S. and British governments. (2) Launch mass action to demand the dissolution of all military blocs, prevent the transportation of nuclear weapons into the country and the nuclear armament of the army, and pass resolutions and launch signature campaigns at various gatherings in towns and villages, demanding that the government of their respective countries issue a declaration opposing the transportation of nuclear weapons and nuclear armament. (3) If the government of their country brazenly transports nuclear weapons and carries out nuclear armament, it is necessary to organize a powerful mass movement. (4) Learn from Japanese friends, organize peace marches, demand the dissolution of military blocs and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and prevent the transportation of nuclear weapons and nuclear armament. (5) Actively exchange experiences in carrying out activities to prohibit nuclear weapons and safeguard world peace in villages, towns, and workplaces, and exchange various reference materials on nuclear weapons in order to understand the impact of nuclear weapons on mankind.
