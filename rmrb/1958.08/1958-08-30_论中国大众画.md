　　On Chinese Mass Art
　　Zuo Hai

　　What is the most appropriate term to call the murals of workers, peasants, and soldiers that are currently emerging in large numbers? I think the most appropriate name is: Chinese Mass Art. There are two meanings here, which means: it is Chinese art, and it is mass art.

　　These paintings are native to China and have not been influenced by Western painting. Their artistic form is recognizably unique to Chinese painting. Whether it is composition, brushwork, outlining, texturing, or coloring, they all conform to the traditional techniques of Chinese painting, and have new developments. They break through the many old rules set by old painters, doing whatever they want, unrestrained, and thus there is a bold innovation and creation in the traditional Chinese modeling art techniques. We can say without exaggeration that these are authentic Chinese paintings, and they have opened a glorious new era in the history of Chinese painting.

　　These paintings are the free creations of the masses of workers and peasants. The situation in which artistic creation was monopolized by a few people in the past has now fundamentally changed. These many pictures in front of us are different from the court paintings, literati paintings, recluse paintings, craftsman paintings, etc. of the old era. They sweep away any scholarly air, reclusive air, bookish air, craftsman air, and other airs. They arise directly from the process of industrial and agricultural production and labor, and are truly mass art. Workers and peasants, from children in their teens to old ladies in their seventies, all dare to think and paint, breaking the superstition about painting art and painters, and painting what they and the broad masses of people like to see and hear. Is it an exaggeration to say that these are typical mass art?

　　Marx wrote in "The German Ideology": "The particularly concentrated expression of the artistic talent of certain individuals, and the suppression of the artistic talent of the broad masses, is the result of the division of labor. Under certain social conditions, everyone is an excellent painter,...In communist society, there will be no special painters, but only people engaged in painting." The current development trend of Chinese mass art is proving that Marx's argument is completely correct. This is the inevitable law of artistic development. In the future communist society, there will be thousands upon thousands of painters and other artists from the workers and peasants, and we can already see the signs of this great situation.

　　Chinese mass art takes socialism and communism as its theme, and they are works that combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. All the images shown on these screens can be found in real life and are reflections of real life. However, they do not mechanically reflect objective reality, but transcend the realm already reached by real life and point out the prospects for the development of objective things. Why is this so? Because the masses of workers and peasants in our country in the Great Leap Forward are advancing at a speed of one day equaling twenty years, and they are not satisfied with the real life created by their labor. They have higher ideals, more desires, and unlimited creativity to realize their ideals and desires. Therefore, they naturally want to look forward and see further; they are very optimistic about the future and full of confidence. All this is reflected in painting as imagination and exaggeration based on reality. This is the color of revolutionary romanticism that is closely integrated with revolutionary realism. Almost without exception, the many pictures in front of us are full of this color. The highest artistic value of Chinese mass art lies here. Otherwise, living in the modern age, we only need to take pictures, why do we still need painting!

　　There is still a lot to say about this issue, but due to space limitations, I will talk about these first.

　　论中国大众画
　　左海
    有什么最恰当的名词来称呼目前大量涌现的工农群众的壁画呢？我以为最恰当的名称是：中国大众画。这里头有两层意思，就是说：它是中国画，又是大众画。
    这些画是在中国土生土长的，没有受到西洋画的影响。它们的艺术形式一望而知是中国画所特有的。无论构图、用笔、勾勒、皴擦、设色等等，都符合于中国画的传统手法，而有了新的发展。它们突破了旧画家所设定的许多老规矩，随心所欲，不受束缚，因而在中国传统的造型艺术手法方面有一种大胆的革新和创造。我们可以毫不夸张地说，这些是地地道道的中国画，它们给中国绘画史打开了光辉的新时代。
    这些画是工农大众的自由创作。过去艺术创作为少数人所垄断的局面现在根本改变了。摆在我们面前的这许多图画，和旧时代的宫廷画、文人画、隐逸画、匠人画等等都不同。它们把什么画院气、山林气、书卷气、匠气以及其他各种气一扫而空。它们直接从工农业生产劳动过程中产生出来，是真正的大众艺术。工农大众从十来岁的小孩子到七十几岁的老大娘，人人敢想敢画，破除了对于绘画艺术和画家的迷信，画出了自己和广大人们所喜闻乐见的东西。我们说这是典型的大众画难道有什么过分吗？
    马克思在“德意志的意识形态”中写道：“某些个人的艺术才能的特别集中的表现，和广大群众的艺术才能的遭受压抑，这是分工的结果。在某种社会条件下，每个人都是优秀的画家，……在共产主义社会里，将没有特殊的画家，而只有从事绘画工作的人。”中国大众画现时发展的趋势，正在证明着马克思的论断是完全正确的。这是艺术发展的必然规律。到了将来的共产主义社会，工农大众的画家和其他艺术家一定会有千千万万，现在已经可以看见这个伟大的局面的端倪了。
    中国大众画是以社会主义和共产主义的思想为主题的，它们是革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的作品。所有这些画面上表现的形象都可以在现实生活中找到根据，都是现实生活的反映。但是，它们并不是机械地反映客观现实，而是超越了现实生活所已经达到的境界，给客观事物的发展指出了远景。为什么会这样呢？因为在大跃进中的我国工农大众，正以一天等于二十年的速度前进，他们对于自己的劳动所创造的现实生活并不感到满足，他们有更高的理想，有更多的愿望，有无限的创造力能够实现自己的理想和愿望。所以他们自然而然地要向前看，要看得更远；他们对于未来非常乐观，充满着信心。这一切反映到绘画上来，就是在现实的基础上的想像和夸张。这就是和革命的现实主义紧紧地结合在一起的革命浪漫主义的色彩。摆在我们面前的许多图画几乎无例外地都充满了这种色彩。中国大众画的最高艺术价值也就在这里。否则，生在现代的我们，只要照相就够了，何必还要有绘画呢！
    关于这个问题要讲的话还很多，这里限于篇幅，先讲这一些。
