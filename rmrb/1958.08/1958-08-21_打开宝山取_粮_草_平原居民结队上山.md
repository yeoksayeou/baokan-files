Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin - People in the plain areas of Hebei Province are organizing teams to go up the mountains to develop resources and mine iron. Currently, in Baoding, Handan, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou areas alone, more than 100,000 people have signed up to go up the mountains, and about 30,000 of them have already set up camps on the mountain tops.

In Baoding area, the thirteen counties and cities including Yi County, Xushui, and Tang County, already have 24,000 iron smelting personnel from the plains. In just over ten days, they have built 21 new small blast furnaces and 866 indigenous iron smelting furnaces, mined more than 20,000 tons of ore, and smelted more than 110 tons of pig iron. Zanhuang County, a mountainous county that originally felt short of equipment and labor, originally planned to build sixteen small blast furnaces this year. With the strong support of equipment and manpower from the people of Shijiazhuang City, it has now decided to increase that to twenty-nine.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou - In the midst of vigorously developing the iron and steel industry, the Xuchang area of Henan Province, with the spirit of communist cooperation, has solved the problem of how counties and cities without iron ore resources can also vigorously develop the iron and steel industry.

Currently, the iron and steel and coal expeditionary forces organized by Shangshui, Xuchang, Changge and other counties have gone to Yuxian, Baofeng and other counties to build iron and steel plants. Xuchang County transferred more than 200 cadres, including the county party secretary and county party committee members, and organized a labor force of 13,000 people to march to Bachun, Yuxian County, to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry. Sixteen smelting plants, one thousand two hundred and forty indigenous furnaces, simple small blast furnaces, and eight-meter-high blast furnaces have now been established.

Yuxian, Wuyang, Lushan, Baofeng and other mountainous counties in Xuchang area have very rich iron ore resources, but they have little labor and are unable to fully develop these resources on their own. Therefore, they very much welcome the people of neighboring counties to build the iron and steel industry.

　　打开宝山取“粮”“草”
    平原居民结队上山
    据新华社天津电  河北省平原地区的人民纷纷结队上山，开发资源，采矿炼铁。目前，仅保定、邯郸、天津、张家口专区，就有十几万人报名上山，其中约三万人已在山头上安营下寨。
    保定专区的易县、徐水、唐县等十三个县、市，已有两万四千名来自平原的炼铁队伍。他们在十多天的时间内，就新建起二十一座小高炉，八百六十六座土法炼铁炉，采出矿石两万多吨，炼出生铁一百一十多吨。原来设备、劳动力感到缺乏的山区县——赞皇县，原计划今年兴建十六座小高炉，在石家庄市人民的大力支援设备和人力的情况下，现已决定增加到二十九座。
    据新华社郑州电  河南省许昌专区在大办钢铁工业当中，以共产主义大协作的精神，解决了没有铁矿资源的县、市也能大办钢铁工业的问题。
    目前，商水、许昌、长葛等县组织的钢铁、煤炭远征军，已经分赴禹县、宝丰等县建设了钢铁厂。许昌县抽调包括县委书记、县委委员二百多名干部，组织一万三千人的劳动大军，远征到禹县扒村大办钢铁工业。现在已建立起冶炼厂十六个，土炉、简易小高炉、八公尺高炉一千二百四十座。
    许昌专区的山区禹县、舞阳、鲁山、宝丰等县，铁矿资源十分丰富，但是劳力少，自己无力充分开发这些资源，因此他们十分欢迎邻县人民来建设钢铁工业。
