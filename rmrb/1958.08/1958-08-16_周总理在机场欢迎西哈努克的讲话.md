　　Premier Zhou's Speech at the Airport Welcoming Sihanouk

Your Royal Highness, friends, comrades: On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I warmly welcome His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, our friendly neighbor, and the national delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia he leads. This is Prince Sihanouk's second visit to China in two and a half years. The Chinese people still fondly recall the good impressions that His Royal Highness left us during his first visit. We are very honored and pleased to have the opportunity to receive His Royal Highness again.

　　Not long ago, we warmly celebrated the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. Now, we welcome Prince Sihanouk to our country for a friendly visit with excitement and joy. These two happy events illustrate that the traditional friendly relations between China and Cambodia have unfolded a new chapter, and also mark the consolidation and victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

　　This visit of His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk to China comes at a time when the situation in the Middle East seriously threatens world peace. We are very pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk on the current international situation in order to further strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia in the cause of safeguarding world peace.

　　On the 9th of this month, in a statement issued on the eve of his departure, His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk said that the purpose of his visit to China was for the happiness of our two peoples, and to consolidate the foundation of friendship and unity between our two countries in the cause of safeguarding peace. We firmly believe that this noble goal will certainly be fully realized through His Royal Highness's friendly visit.

　　Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people!

　　Long live world peace!

    新华社15日讯　周恩来总理在机场欢迎西哈努克首相的讲话全文：
    亲王殿下，朋友们，同志们：我代表中国政府和中国人民，热烈地欢迎我们的友好邻邦柬埔寨王国的首相西哈努克亲王殿下和他所率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团。这是在两年半的时间里，西哈努克亲王殿下对中国的第二次访问。中国人民至今还在愉快地回忆着亲王殿下在第一次访问中给我们留下的良好印象。现在我们能够有机会再一次接待亲王殿下，感到十分荣幸和高兴。
    不久以前，我们热烈地庆祝了中、柬两国建立正常的外交关系。现在，我们又以兴奋和愉快的心情欢迎西哈努克亲王殿下来我国进行友好访问。这两件喜事说明中、柬两国之间传统的友好关系展开了新的一页，同时也标志着和平共处五项原则的巩固和胜利。
    这次西哈努克亲王殿下来中国访问，正是中东的局势严重地威胁着世界和平的时候。我们很高兴能够有这个机会同西哈努克亲王殿下就目前的国际形势交换意见，以进一步加强中、柬两国在维护世界和平的事业中的友好合作。
    本月9日，西哈努克亲王殿下在动身前夕发来的声明中说，他这次访问中国的目的是为了我们两国人民的幸福，在维护和平的事业中巩固我们两国之间的友谊和团结的基础。我们深信，这个崇高的目的一定能够通过亲王殿下的这次友好访问得到完全的实现。
    中、柬两国人民之间的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
