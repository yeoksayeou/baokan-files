Our Tianjin Dispatch, August 28th (Reporter Fang Chen) reports: Tang County, Hebei Province, paid attention to improving the indigenous blast furnace iron smelting methods learned from other places to suit the local ore characteristics and fuel supply conditions, ensuring that most of the newly built indigenous blast furnaces in the county could produce a smooth flow of molten iron.

　　The initial two hundred and seventy-odd Jingxing-style indigenous iron smelting furnaces built in Tang County failed to produce iron after repeated trials. Some people's thinking about indigenous iron smelting wavered as a result. After criticizing this negative and doubtful thinking, the Tang County Party Committee selected magnetite with the same composition as Jingxing iron ore for experimentation. As a result, iron was quickly produced. This experiment clarified a principle for the county's leaders: indigenous iron smelting is generally created based on the ore composition and fuel supply conditions of a certain region, and has great regional characteristics. Foreign experience cannot be mechanically copied. The County Party Committee then mobilized workers in all iron smelting plants in the county to create indigenous blast furnaces suitable for the local "soil and water" based on the experience of indigenous blast furnace iron smelting learned from other places. The cadres and workers of the iron smelting plants also had a clear understanding. From August 10th to 20th, in just over ten days, the county created forty-six indigenous blast furnaces suitable for smelting five different structures of limonite, specularite, and other ores. At present, twenty-six of them have been put into production, producing more than 23,000 catties of iron. By the end of August, this county will have five hundred indigenous blast furnaces, 2.8 to 3.3 meters high, put into production, and the iron production will reach 800 tons.

　　In order to make the learned indigenous blast furnace suitable for the local "soil and water," most iron smelting plants first built experimental small blast furnaces, adopting the method of experimenting, improving, and summarizing at the same time, to find out the furnace structure and operating methods suitable for smelting local iron ore, and then build large indigenous blast furnaces. Therefore, after the newly built indigenous blast furnaces in this county are put into production, most of them produce iron normally and have high output. Workers at the Dongzhuangwan Iron Smelting Plant built a small one-meter furnace according to the "Yangcheng-style" indigenous blast furnace for testing. They could not produce iron at the beginning. They then held a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" to organize workers to discuss and find the reasons, dismantled the furnace, and rebuilt it based on the problems found. In this way, they continuously built eighteen small furnaces and improved them more than twenty times, integrating the advantages of the Yangcheng style, Funing style, and Jingxing style indigenous blast furnaces, and finally created an indigenous blast furnace and operating method suitable for smelting specularite. This indigenous blast furnace with a volume of one cubic meter can be built in two days and produces 1,000 to 1,500 catties of gray cast iron per day. Due to this continuous research and improvement, the output of the recently built indigenous blast furnaces is higher than the previous ones. The employees of the Chengguan Fourth Township United Iron Smelting Plant recently created a blast furnace with a volume of one cubic meter. On the day of trial production, the iron output per hour reached about 100 catties.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 28th. Workers in the coking workshop of the Qianghua Steel Plant in Emei County, Sichuan Province, successfully created an indigenous hot blast furnace during the technical revolution. When used together with a small blast furnace with an effective volume of 0.67 cubic meters, it can produce more than one ton of iron a day, while a furnace of the same size can only produce about 300 kilograms of iron a day with cold air. This kind of indigenous hot blast furnace can be promoted on indigenous blast furnaces of 3 to 5 cubic meters and is the direction for the technological transformation of indigenous blast furnaces.

　　Under the call of the "Ten Thousand Furnaces Movement" of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the workers in this workshop used waste bricks and stones to build a "Drought Resistance" brand indigenous blast furnace. At the beginning, they used cold air operation and could only melt iron slag, not iron ore, and accidents such as furnace hearth freezing often occurred. The main reason was that the temperature was too low. The deputy director of the workshop, Min Furen, came up with the idea of an indigenous hot blast furnace built by the workers, which could increase the furnace temperature of the blast furnace and successfully solve the two key problems generally encountered by indigenous blast furnaces in the province: how to smoothly produce iron and how to produce more iron.

　　The structure of this hot blast furnace is very simple and can be built entirely with sand, gravel, and yellow sand mud. Its shape is rectangular, with one end close to the tuyere of the blast furnace and the other end with air intake. There is a coal filling hole on the top, which is usually covered tightly and opened when in use. The inner shape is funnel-shaped, with a furnace bridge at the bottom and a place to store ash below the furnace bridge. They add charcoal once every hour, burn 300 kilograms of charcoal every day, and clean the ash once every two days or one day.

　　At present, this workshop has produced more than ten tons of iron. The workers are continuing to build a second indigenous furnace, preparing to carry out simple steam blowing on the second indigenous furnace to further increase production.

　　唐县土高炉正常出铁有妙诀：
　　根据本地“水土”吸取外地经验
    峨眉县创造土热风炉，开辟了土高炉技术改造的方向
    本报天津28日电　记者方辰报道：河北省唐县注意把从外地学来的土高炉炼铁方法加以改进，使之适合本地矿石特性和燃料供应条件，保证了全县新建的土高炉绝大部分都能铁水畅流。
    唐县最初建的二百七十多座井陉式土炼铁炉，试验多次炼不出铁来。有人因此对土法炼铁思想上发生了动摇。中共唐县县委在批判了这种消极怀疑的思想以后，选用同井陉铁矿成分一样的磁铁矿进行了试验。结果很快炼出了铁来。这次试验，使这个县的领导人员明确了一条道理：土法炼铁一般都是根据一定地区的矿石成分和燃料供应条件创造出来的，有很大地区性，不能机械地搬用外地经验。县委于是发动全县各炼铁厂工人根据从外地学来的土高炉炼铁经验，创造适合本地“水土”的土高炉。各炼铁厂的干部、工人也思想豁亮了。从8月10日到20日仅十来天时间，全县就创造出适合冶炼褐铁矿、镜铁矿等五种不同构造的土高炉四十六座。目前，已有二十六座先后投入生产，产铁二万三千多斤。到8月底，这个县将有五百座二点八到三点三公尺高的土高炉投入生产，产铁量将达到八百吨。
    这个县为了使学来的土高炉适合本地“水土”，大部分炼铁厂都先建试验性的小高炉，采取边试验、边改进、边总结的办法，找出适合冶炼本地铁矿石的炉体构造和操作方法，然后再建大土高炉。因此，这个县新建的土高炉投入生产以后，绝大部分出铁正常，产量高。东庄湾炼铁厂工人按照“阳城式”土高炉建了一座一公尺的小炉进行试验。开始炼不出铁来，他们便召开“诸葛亮会”，组织工人讨论，找原因，把炉子拆了根据找出的毛病另建。就这样，连续建了十八座小炉，改进了二十多次，综合了阳城式、抚宁式和井陉式等三种土高炉的优点，终于创造出适合冶炼镜铁矿的土高炉和操作方法。这种容积一立方公尺的土高炉，两天就能建成，日产灰口铁一千到一千五百斤。由于这样不断地钻研改进，最近新建的土高炉，产铁量一座比一座高。城关四乡联合炼铁厂职工最近创造的容积一立方公尺的高炉，在试生产的当日，每一小时的出铁量就达到一百斤左右。
    本报成都28日电　四川省峨眉县强华钢铁厂炼焦车间工人在技术革命中，创造成功土热风炉。用它同有效容积为零点六七立方公尺的小高炉装配在一起，一天可出铁一吨多，而同样大小的炉子用冷风每天只能出铁三百公斤左右。这种土热风炉可在三至五立方公尺土高炉上推广，是土高炉技术改造的方向。
    这个车间的工人在中共四川省委“万炉运动”的号召下，用废砖石修砌了一座“抗旱”号土高炉，开初用冷风操作，只能化铁渣，不能用矿石炼铁，而且还常发生炉缸冻结等事故，主要原因是温度太低。车间副主任闵甫仁设想出来由工人们修建的土热风炉，可以提高高炉的炉温，能够顺利解决全省土高炉普遍遇到的两个关键问题：如何顺利出铁和多出铁。
    这种热风炉的构造很简单，可以完全用砂石和黄砂泥修建。它的外形是长方形，一端紧挨高炉风嘴，一端入风。顶上有一个添炭孔，平时盖严，用时揭开。内形为漏斗式，底部有炉桥，炉桥下是储灰的地方。他们每小时添炭一次，每天烧炭三百公斤，两天或一天清灰一次。
    目前，这个车间已出铁十多吨。工人们在继续修建第二座土炉，准备在第二座土炉上搞简易蒸气鼓风，以进一步提高产量。
