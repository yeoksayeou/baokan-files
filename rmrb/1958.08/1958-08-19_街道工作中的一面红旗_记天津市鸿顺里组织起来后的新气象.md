　　A Red Banner in Street Work
　　——On the New Atmosphere of Hongshun Lane, Tianjin, After Being Organized
　　Hongshun Lane in Tianjin is a bright red banner in street work.

　　This red banner, guiding street residents towards a socialist collective life, is being planted higher and higher. In Tianjin, tens of thousands of residents are following it; in other places, more and more urban residents are looking up to it.

　　Perhaps that's why, in Hongshun Lane, this small, cross-shaped alley, from mid-June until now, it's been so bustling, rain or shine, with a constant stream of visitors. Various streets and districts of Tianjin, Zhangjiakou City in Hebei Province, and even Anshan and Jiamusi in the Northeast, and Chongqing in the Southwest, have all sent people to visit... In total, there have been more than 40,000 visitors.

　　In July, on a clear afternoon after the rain, several cars stopped at the entrance of the lane. "Who's here?" the residents of Hongshun Lane wondered.

　　"It's Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of our Party Central Committee!" The news spread like lightning throughout Hongshun Lane. The already narrow alley and the already small courtyards instantly became even more crowded, and the hearts of everyone in Hongshun Lane, old and young, were immediately stirred.

　　...Comrade Shaoqi's visit brought great encouragement to the residents of Hongshun Lane. Auntie Jia, who works as a cook in this socialist big family, always says: "Look, our little alley, just organized, has already alarmed the leaders of the Central Committee. We must have ambition and consolidate our big family!"

　　In fact, who among the members living in this big family doesn't think that way? In the past few days, they enthusiastically discussed the "Draft Charter of the Hongshun Lane Production Service Cooperative." Almost every time a clause was read, everyone shouted, "This one's right!" "This one's good!" cheering with joy.
　　A New Page in Life History
　　From June 14th, the residents of Hongshun Lane transitioned from a scattered individual life to collectivization. A new page has been opened in their life history.

　　Every day at eight o'clock in the morning, a bell rings, and the seventeen young and middle-aged women of the production team carry their spinning wheels and bundles of electrical wire and copper wire to a corner of the alley - a workshop with an awning. The spinning wheels spin rapidly, wrapping the bundles of copper wire around wooden spindles, completing a process for the nearby Hengda Wire Factory.

　　Mothers go to work, and children under the age of seven are sent to nursery classes and toddler groups. There, the children sing, play games, listen to stories, and learn manners, cultivating good habits in collective life, so mothers can work with peace of mind.

　　The three elderly women who serve as cooks in the residents' canteen prepare meals for more than ninety adults and children every day and specially prepare soft food for children and patients. Now, they implement the method of "collective kitchen, dispersed dining" (that is, buying the food and taking it home to eat). The food in the canteen is about the same as what the residents used to cook themselves, but the price is much cheaper, costing just over a dime per person per meal. With this canteen, the whole alley can save more than 4,800 jin of coal, more than 100 jin of grain, 200 liang of cooking oil, and 3,000 gallons of water per month.

　　If residents need any daily necessities, there is a daily necessities supply service station at the entrance of the alley, which always has more than 300 kinds of goods. If they want to save money, there is a savings service station in the alley. If women participate in production and don't have time to make clothes, they can go to their sewing group, which guarantees fast and good work.

　　In the evening, it is time for the residents who have worked all day to carry out recreational activities. People can go to their club to play chess and learn to sing; they can also borrow books and picture albums from their library. There is also a fixed time each week to study culture, politics, current affairs, and exchange production technology and experience. On weekends, they can also watch movies in their open-air cinema. Sunday is the holiday of this big family, and people spend their holiday at home with their relatives.
　From Individual Life to Collective Life
　　Hongshun Lane is a lane with only forty-two households. Among those living here, except for one small vendor and two households of elderly people living alone, the rest are all families of workers and staff. In these worker and staff families, most adults work in factories and offices, leaving only twenty-three housewives and five elderly men at home.

　　The light of the general line of socialist construction shone on Hongshun Lane, illuminating everyone's heart. The housewives put forward wishes and requests to serve the construction of the motherland. When the news that the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee had decided to mobilize the residents' strength to support production and construction spread, it immediately aroused their strong response. The Party organization and street office of Tianwei Road Street immediately carried out organizational mobilization work here, pointed out the path of women's liberation and the great significance of supporting production and construction to the residents of Hongshun Lane; and helped them establish contact with the nearby Hengda Wire Factory, and established a production team to process copper wire winding for the factory.

　　As most housewives participated in production, the establishment of nursery groups and canteens became an urgent matter. Therefore, while organizing production, they also established nursery groups and a residents' public canteen. Other collective undertakings serving production have also been established successively.

　　The participation of Hongshun Lane residents in production and service work is entirely voluntary. The division of labor is based on a combination of voluntary and elected methods. Auntie Jia is good at cooking, so she volunteered to be a cook. Auntie Zhao and Granny Yang are patient with children, so everyone elected them as nannies. Auntie Hu has a sewing machine at home, so naturally she became a member of the sewing group. Uncle Jia loves cleanliness and has become the person in charge of the entire lane's hygiene and beautification. There are also Grandpa Yang, who is over seventy years old, and Grandpa Zhao, who is sixty-nine years old, who know something about commercial practices, so they became service personnel at the daily necessities supply service station. Grandpa Wang Junting, who can write and calculate, became an accountant. In this way, everyone with some labor power participated in glorious labor.
　Life is Changing, and People are Changing Too
　　After visiting here, many people asked the question: After breaking through old habits, what changes have taken place in the minds of the housewives?

　　This question is a bit difficult for the people accompanying the visit to answer for a while. This is not because there are no changes, but because there are too many changes!

　　Huang Shuqin, who lives at number 2, and Guan Xiuying, who lives at number 7, are both young women under thirty years old. They go to work and produce when the bell rings every day, eat in the canteen after work, and their children are taken care of by the nursery group. They have never felt so comfortable and happy as they do today.

　　Huang Shuqin is only twenty-eight years old this year, but because her family was poor, she got married at the age of sixteen. In the past ten years, in her words: "All day long, it's bowls and pots, washing and scrubbing, I'm already tired of it"; what's more, in recent years, many women of her age who are not burdened by housework have participated in production, which makes her even more envious. She has thought more than once: "How great it would be if I could be a worker one day!" But she has also been discouraged more than once: "Who would I give my four children to?"...

　　The socialist big family is organized, and the labor force of housewives has been liberated. This is really great news for young women like Huang Shuqin and Guan Xiuying. The output of their copper wire winding is almost increasing in a straight line, and their names have also been posted on the "Praise Column" on the wall of the club, saying that they are active participants in cultural learning. Wang Huizhen, who is younger than Huang Shuqin, ran to the workshop with her spinning wheel just seven days after "confinement." People persuaded her to go back, but she said: "When I hear your spinning wheels ringing, I feel anxious. Just give me some work, it's okay to do it at home..."

　　Collective production and collective life are so strongly attracting the residents of Hongshun Lane. Auntie Jia is fifty-three years old. She has two sons and a daughter working in factories, who give the old couple more than seventy yuan a month for living expenses, and life is quite comfortable. However, when the lane was about to organize collective production and collective life, the old couple became the most active people. Auntie Jia said this: "I don't participate in work for the sake of money. Now the country needs labor for construction. If I can't contribute a lot of strength, I will contribute a little. If I cook for everyone, wouldn't everyone not have to cook anymore!"

　　Collective life is like a big melting pot, which can cultivate people's thoughts and cast old relationships between people into new relationships. People who come to visit Hongshun Lane have mostly rested in the two west rooms near the gate of courtyard number 11. Opposite it is the canteen, and diagonally opposite is the "small warehouse" where the "raw materials" for the copper wire winding workshop are stored. The owner of these rooms is the current production team leader, Zong Bingzhen.

　　Speaking of Zong Bingzhen, even she herself is surprised. In the past, when she went out to buy groceries, she was not even comfortable if she forgot to lock the door, let alone how much she valued these rooms. Once, a neighbor had guests and wanted to borrow a room from her for temporary accommodation, and she subtly gave them the cold shoulder. She thought: "They say it's a temporary loan, what if they move in and 'dig' themselves in and don't want to move out?" However, Zong Bingzhen, like other worker's family members, had long hoped that one day she could also participate in production, learn culture, and no longer revolve around the stove all day long. Nearly two months ago, the lane began to organize production, and also wanted to establish a canteen and nursery group. She knew that the days she had been looking forward to had now arrived. At this time, her thoughts changed greatly. She thought: To establish a big family, no one can be separated from anyone, and everyone serves everyone. Therefore, when the canteen couldn't find a house, she gave up her east room; saying that the house was narrow, she took the initiative to propose dismantling the kang (brick bed). When the "raw materials" were brought in and there was no place to put them, she turned the other east room into the "small warehouse" of her workshop. She said: "What's yours and mine, it all belongs to our big family!"

　　The ideological changes of the women organized in the big family are many. This change reflects that the communist idea of "one for all, all for one" is growing in people's hearts day by day...

　　In this great era where "one day equals twenty years," street residents are also leaping forward again and again along the socialist-communist road.

　　 街道工作中的一面红旗
　　——记天津市鸿顺里组织起来后的新气象
    天津的鸿顺里在街道工作中是一面鲜红的大旗。
    这面引导街道居民走向社会主义集体生活的红旗插得越来越高。在天津，成千上万的居民在跟随着它；在外地，也有越来越多的城市居民在仰望着它。
    就是这个缘故吧，在鸿顺里这个十字形的小胡同里，从6月中旬到现在，不论晴天雨天，总是那么熙熙攘攘，来参观访问的人一直不断。天津市各街道、各区，河北省的张家口市，以至远在东北的鞍山、佳木斯，西南的重庆等，都有人来过……总计来参观访问的已经有四万多人。
    7月里，一个雨过初晴的下午，几辆小汽车停在胡同口。“这是谁来了呢？”鸿顺里的居民们猜想着。
    “是咱们党中央的副主席刘少奇同志来啦！”消息像闪电一样传遍了整个鸿顺里。本来就挺狭窄的胡同，本来就不宽敞的院子，顿时更加拥挤了，鸿顺里老老少少的心里，立时沸腾起来。
    ……少奇同志的访问，给鸿顺里居民带来了极大的鼓舞。在这个社会主义大家庭里担任炊事员的贾大娘，总是念念不忘：“你看，咱们这条小胡同，刚刚组织起来，就把中央的首长给惊动来了。咱们可得长志气，千万把大家庭巩固住！”
    其实，生活在这个大家庭里的成员，又有谁不是这样想的呢？最近几天，他们热情地讨论了“鸿顺里生产服务合作社社章草案”。几乎每念完一条，大家就喊一阵“这条对！”、
  “这条好！”高兴一阵。
      生活史上新的一页
    从6月14日开始，鸿顺里的居民由分散的个体生活走向了集体化。在他们的生活史上掀开了新的一页。
    每天早八点，一阵铃响，生产组的十七个青壮年妇女就搬着纺车，端着一团团电线铜丝，走向胡同的一角——搭着天棚的车间。纺车飞快地旋转起来，把一团团的铜丝缠在木轴上，这就为附近的恒大电线厂完成了一道工序。
    妈妈上工了，七周岁以下的孩子也分别被送进了幼儿班和托儿组。在那里，孩子们唱歌、游戏、听故事、学礼貌，在集体生活中培育着良好的习惯，妈妈们也可以安心生产了。
    担任居民食堂炊事员的三位老大娘，每天要给在食堂入伙的九十多个大人、孩子准备饭菜，还特地为孩子和病人准备软食。现在他们实行的是“集体厨房，分散食堂”的办法（即自己买回家去吃）。食堂的饭食和居民们过去自己作着吃的差不多，但价钱却便宜多了，一个人一顿饭只需一角多钱。有了这个食堂，全胡同每月可以节约煤四千八百多斤，节约粮食一百多斤、食油二百两、水三千加仑。
    居民们需要什么日用物品，胡同口有个生活日用品供应服务站，经常准备有三百多种货物。如果要储蓄，胡同里有储蓄服务站。妇女们参加生产没时间做衣服，还可以到自己的缝纫组去，保管做得又快又好。
    晚上，是劳动了一天的居民们开展文娱活动的时间。人们可以到自己的俱乐部里下旗、学唱歌；也可以到自己的图书馆里借阅图书、画报。每星期还有固定的时间学习文化、政治和时事，交流生产技术经验。周末，他们还可以在自己的露天电影院看电影。星期日是这个大家庭的例假日，人们就在自己的家里和亲人一起度假日。
  从个体生活到集体生活
    鸿顺里是一条只有四十二户居民的胡同。在这里居住的，除一户小商贩、两户孤老户外，其余都是职工家庭。在这些职工家庭中，多数成年人都在工厂、机关中工作，家里只剩下二十三个家庭妇女和五位老大爷。
    社会主义建设总路线的光芒射到了鸿顺里，照亮了每一个人的心，家庭妇女们纷纷提出了为祖国建设服务的愿望和要求。当中共天津市委决定调动居民力量支援生产建设的消息传出后，立即引起了她们的强烈反映。天纬路街的党组织和街办事处立即在这里进行了组织发动工作，给鸿顺里居民指出了妇女解放的道路和支援生产建设的重大意义；并且帮助她们和附近的恒大电线厂建立了联系，成立了一个为工厂加工缠铜丝的生产小组。
    随着多数家庭妇女参加生产，成立托儿组和食堂便成了迫不及待的事情。于是，他们在组织生产的同时，又成立了托儿组和居民公共食堂。为生产服务的其他一些集体事业，也都相继成立起来了。
    鸿顺里居民参加生产和服务工作完全是自愿的。劳动分工是采取了自愿和推选相结合的办法。贾大娘是做饭的能手，她自告奋勇担任炊事员。赵大娘、杨奶奶对孩子耐心，大家就推选她们当了保育员。胡大娘家有缝纫机，自然就成了缝纫组员。贾大爷爱干净，成了全胡同卫生和美化的负责人。还有七十多岁的杨六爷和六十九岁的赵四爷，懂得一些商业行道，便当了日用品供应服务站的服务员。能写会算的王俊亭大爷担任了会计。这样，每一个有点劳动力的人都参加了光荣的劳动。
  生活变了人也在变
    许多人在这里参观了以后，提出这样的问题：家庭妇女们冲破了旧的生活习惯之后，思想里有些什么变化呢？
    这个问题，叫陪同参观的人真有点一时说不上来。这倒不是因为没有变化，而是变化太多啊！
    住在二号的黄淑琴和住在七号的关秀英，都是不满三十岁的年轻妇女。她们每天铃响上工生产，下工到食堂吃饭，孩子又有托儿组照看，她们的心情从来没有今天这样舒畅和愉快。
    黄淑琴今年才二十八岁，可是因为娘家生活苦，从十六岁就结了婚。这十几年，用她的话说：“整天是碗呀锅呀，洗呀刷呀，早就摸腻了”；更何况，近几年来，许多和她年纪差不多而没有家务牵累的妇女参加了生产，更叫她眼热。她不止一次地想过：“哪一天我也当个工人该多好！”可是也不止一次地泄了气：“我这四个孩子又交给谁呢？”……
    社会主义大家庭组织起来了，家庭妇女的劳动力得到了解放，这对黄淑琴、关秀英这些年轻妇女来说，真是天大的喜事。她俩缠铜丝的产量几乎在直线上升，俱乐部墙上那个“表扬栏”，也贴出了她俩的名字，说她们是文化学习中的积极分子。年纪比黄淑琴还小的王慧珍，“坐月子”刚七天就拿着纺车往车间跑，人们劝她回去，她却说：“我一听见你们纺车响，心里就发急，哪管给我点活，坐在家里干也行……”
    集体生产，集体生活，就是这么强烈地吸引着鸿顺里的居民们。贾大娘是五十三岁的人了，她有两个儿子、一个闺女在工厂作工，每月给老两口子七十多元生活费，日子过得满宽绰。可是，当胡同里要组织集体生产、集体生活的时候，这老两口却成了最积极的人。贾大娘这么说：“我参加工作不是为的钱，现在国家建设需要劳动力，我不能出大力就出小力，我给大伙做饭，不是大伙就甭再作饭了吗！”
    集体生活真像一座大熔炉，它能陶冶人的思想，也能把人和人的旧关系铸成新的关系，来鸿顺里参观的人，大都在十一号院靠大门的两间西屋里休息过。它的对面就是食堂，斜对面是缠铜丝车间放“原料”的“小库房”。这几间房子的主人就是如今的生产组长宗炳珍。
    说起宗炳珍，连她自己也奇怪。在过去，她有时出去买菜，门忘了锁，都不放心，更别说对这几间房子是多么看重了。有一回，邻居来了客人，想借她一间房子暂住，她转弯抹角地让人碰了个软钉子。她心想：“说是暂借，搬进来‘挖’不出去怎么办？”但是，宗炳珍也和其他职工家属一样，早就盼望有一天自己也能参加生产，学文化，不再整天围着锅台转。将近两个月以前，胡同里开始组织生产，还要成立食堂、托儿组，她知道过去盼望的日子现在来到了。这时，她的想法大大改变了，她想：要成立大家庭，就谁也离不开谁，谁都为谁服务。于是，食堂找不到房子，她把东屋让出来了；说房子窄，她主动提出把炕拆了。领来的“原料”没处放，她又把另一间东屋当成自己车间的“小库房”。她说：“什么你的我的，都是咱们大家庭的！”
    组织在大家庭中的妇女，思想变化是很多的。这种变化，正反映了“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想正在人们的心里与日俱长……。
    在这“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，街道居民们也正在沿着社会主义—共产主义的道路，跃进再跃进。
