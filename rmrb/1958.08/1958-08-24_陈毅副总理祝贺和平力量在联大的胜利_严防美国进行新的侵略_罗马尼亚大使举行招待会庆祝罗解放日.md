Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd – Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, speaking tonight at a reception celebrating the 14th anniversary of Romania's liberation, congratulated the forces striving for peace and upholding national independence on their recent victory at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session.

Vice Premier Chen Yi especially reminded peace-loving countries and peoples around the world that they must not relax their vigilance, and must continue their struggle to prevent the United States from undermining the resolutions of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session, and to prevent the United States from launching new aggression under other pretexts.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: Before adjourning, the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session passed a resolution clearly stipulating that the troops of the United States and the United Kingdom should withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible. This thwarted the conspiracy of the United States and the United Kingdom to evade troop withdrawal and to deceive the United Nations into continuing their aggression against Arab countries under its banner.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized: "The UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session passing a resolution does not mean that the aggression by the United States and the United Kingdom against Lebanon, Jordan, and other Arab countries has been eliminated, nor does it mean that the threat to peace in the Middle East and the world has been eliminated. Imperialism has always been untrustworthy when it comes to international agreements. In order to carry out aggression, imperialism can shamelessly put forward the most absurd excuses. After the United States occupied Lebanon under the pretext of 'protecting its nationals,' it immediately sent troops to Cuba under the pretext of 'defending the water supply system.' Recently, U.S. troops even stationed themselves in Singapore for 'rest.' Therefore, peace-loving countries and peoples around the world must not relax their vigilance, and must continue their struggle to prevent the United States from undermining the resolutions of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session, and to prevent the United States from launching new aggression under other pretexts."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The Chinese people have never forgotten that the United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan, and therefore have the deepest sympathy for all countries and peoples subjected to U.S. aggression. The Chinese people will, as in the past, do everything in their power to participate in the struggle for peace and to safeguard the sovereignty and independence of all countries. This struggle is just, and therefore it will continuously advance from victory to victory."

The Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception welcomed Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech with warm applause.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd – Romanian Ambassador to China, Rudenco, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Romania's liberation.

Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China attended tonight's reception.

Members of the Cambodian Royal National Delegation: Minister of National Defense, Ground Defense, and National Security Tioulong, and Minister of Economy and Finance Touch Kim, were also invited to attend.

At the reception, Ambassador Rudenco introduced to hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests the great achievements Romania has made in socialist construction since its liberation. He then said, "The Romanian people, who are part of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, are determined to fight to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp. They regard this as a guarantee of their national independence and the successful, high-speed socialist construction."

The ambassador then pointed out that the Romanian People's Republic pursues a foreign policy of peace and promoting cooperation among all nations. The Romanian people support the struggle for freedom and the strengthening of national independence, oppose colonialism and the forces of imperialism, and condemn any interference by these forces in the internal affairs of all countries.

The ambassador warmly congratulated the sincere, fraternal cooperative relationship that has been established between Romania and China in various fields such as politics, economy, culture, science, and technology, and congratulated the Chinese people on the new achievements they have made in the recent Great Leap Forward.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception, congratulating the Romanian people on their glorious festival. He said: "On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I warmly congratulate the Romanian people on the great achievements they have made in the cause of building socialism under the correct leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Romanian government. I congratulate the continuous strengthening and development of the fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Romania, and congratulate the Romanian People's Republic on its important contributions to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and maintaining world peace."

Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Romanian government and people for the assistance they have given to China's socialist construction.

During the reception, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to toast the unity and friendly cooperation of the people of all socialist countries, and to toast the friendship of all nations and world peace.

　　陈毅副总理祝贺和平力量在联大的胜利
    严防美国进行新的侵略
    罗马尼亚大使举行招待会庆祝罗解放日
    新华社23日讯　陈毅副总理兼外交部长今晚在庆祝罗马尼亚解放十四周年的招待会上讲话时，祝贺争取和平和维护民族独立的力量最近在联大紧急特别会议上所取得的胜利。
    陈毅副总理特别提醒世界上爱好和平的国家和人民，决不能放松警惕，必须再接再厉地进行斗争，防止美国破坏联大紧急特别会议的决议，防止美国又在别的借口下进行新的侵略。
    陈毅副总理说：联大紧急特别会议在休会以前通过决议，明确规定美国和英国的军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。这就使美国和英国企图规避撤军并且骗取联合国的旗帜继续对阿拉伯各国进行侵略的阴谋遭到挫败。
    陈毅副总理强调指出：“联大紧急特别会议通过一纸决议，并不等于说美国和英国对黎巴嫩、约旦和其他阿拉伯国家的侵略已经消除，也不等于说西亚和世界的和平所受到的威胁已经消除。帝国主义对于国际协议是一向不守信义的。为了进行侵略，帝国主义可以恬不知耻地提出最荒谬的借口。美国借口‘保护侨民’侵占黎巴嫩以后，紧接着又以‘保卫供水系统’为名把军队派遣到古巴。最近，美国军队竟为了‘休息’进驻新加坡。因此，世界上爱好和平的国家和人民决不能放松警惕，必须再接再厉地进行斗争，防止美国破坏联大紧急特别会议的决议，防止美国又在别的借口下进行新的侵略。”
    陈毅副总理说：“中国人民始终没有忘记，美国至今还霸占着我国领土台湾，因此对于一切受美国侵略的国家和人民抱着最深切的同情。中国人民将会像过去一样，尽一切力量参加争取和平和维护各国的主权和独立的斗争。这个斗争是正义的，因此一定会不断地从胜利走向胜利。”
    出席招待会的中外人士以热烈的掌声欢迎陈毅副总理的讲话。
    据新华社23日讯　罗马尼亚驻中国大使鲁登科今晚举行招待会，庆祝罗马尼亚解放十四周年。
    贺龙、陈毅副总理，李济深、黄炎培、彭真副委员长，外交部章汉夫副部长等人和各国驻华使节出席了今晚的招待会。
    柬埔寨王国国家代表团团员：国防、地面防御和国家安全大臣丁源，经济和财政大臣笃金，也应邀出席。
    鲁登科大使在招待会上向几百位中外客人介绍了罗马尼亚解放后进行社会主义建设的巨大成就以后说：“参加以苏联为首的社会主义国家大家庭的罗马尼亚人民，坚决为加强社会主义阵营的团结而斗争。他们把它看成是自己民族独立和顺利地高速度地进行社会主义建设的保证。”
    大使接着指出，罗马尼亚人民共和国奉行一种和平和促进各国人民合作的对外政策，罗马尼亚人民支持争取自由和加强民族独立的斗争，反对殖民主义和帝国主义的势力，谴责这些势力对各国人民内部事务的任何干涉。
    大使热烈祝贺罗中两国在政治、经济、文化和科学技术等各方面建立起来的真挚的兄弟般合作关系，并且祝贺中国人民在最近的大跃进中所取得的新成就。
    陈毅副总理在招待会上讲话，祝贺罗马尼亚人民的光荣节日。他说：“我代表中国政府和中国人民，热烈地祝贺罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党和政府的正确领导下，在建设社会主义的事业中所获得的巨大成就。祝贺中罗两国的兄弟友谊和互助合作的不断加强和发展，祝贺罗马尼亚人民共和国为了巩固社会主义阵营的团结和维护世界和平所作出的重要贡献。”
    陈毅副总理对罗马尼亚政府和人民在中国的社会主义建设事业中所给予的帮助表示衷心地感谢。
    席间，宾主不断举杯祝贺社会主义各国人民的团结和友好合作，祝贺各国人民的友谊和世界和平。
