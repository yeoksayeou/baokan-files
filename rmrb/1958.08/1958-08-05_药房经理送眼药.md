    Pharmacy Manager Delivers Eye Drops
    My relative was suffering from an eye ailment and wrote to me, entrusting me to buy "Dingzhou Eye Drops" in Zhengzhou City on their behalf and mail it back for them to use. On Sunday, I went to several pharmacies in a row, but could not buy it. Finally, I went to the Zhengzhou City Pharmacy Center’s retail department to request their assistance. The salesperson, Lu Ruizhi, agreed to wait for the manager to return and discuss with him whether they could find a way to buy it, and told me to go home and wait for news.

    Two days later, unexpectedly, the manager of the central retail department, Huang Jihe, and the salesperson, Ma Shuqiu, personally came to tell me that they had found out that "Dingzhou Eye Drops" was produced by the Dingxian Eye Drops Factory in Hebei, and asked how much I wanted to buy, so they could write a letter to order it by mail. Before leaving, I wanted to pay in advance, but they said there was no need, and I could pay after the medicine arrived.

    Sure enough, on June 12, Manager Huang personally delivered the "Dingzhou Eye Drops" to me. I was moved by Manager Huang's enthusiasm and spirit of serving the people, and held his hand tightly for a long time. Through this incident, I feel that in our society, "One for all, all for one" has become a trend.

    药房经理送眼药
    我的亲戚患眼病，来信托我在郑州市代买“定州眼药”寄回去使用。星期天，我连着跑了几家药房，都没有买到。最后到郑州市药房中心门市部请求他们协助，营业员陆瑞芝答应等经理回来和他商量能否设法买到，叫我先回去听信。
    过了两天，想不到中心门市部的经理黄继和同营业员马淑秋亲自来告诉我，他们打听到“定州眼药”是河北定县眼药厂的出品，问我要买多少，他们好去信邮购。临走时，我要先付款，他们说不必，等药到后再给钱。
    果然，6月12日，黄经理就亲自把“定州眼药”给我送来了。我被黄经理的热情为群众服务的精神所感动，紧紧地握着他的手半天放不下来。通过这一件事，使我感到在我们的社会里，“我为人人、人人为我”已成一种风气。　解放军空军某部　刘增吉（附图片）
