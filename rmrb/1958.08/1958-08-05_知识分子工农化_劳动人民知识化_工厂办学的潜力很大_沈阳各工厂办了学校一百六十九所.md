    Intellectuals become workers, and workers become intellectuals
    Factories have great potential for running schools
    Shenyang factories have established 169 schools

    (Our Report) Shenyang, August 5th (Reporters Wen Shuxian and Yao Guilan) -- Over one hundred factories in Shenyang have been vigorously establishing schools. In just three months, they have set up 169 higher and secondary vocational schools, vocational middle schools, and ordinary middle schools, planning to enroll more than 48,000 students.
    The schools run by these factories are basically divided into two categories. One category is part-work, part-study schools, which enroll workers and cadres from the factories to cultivate a knowledgeable working class. Currently, there are not many of these schools in Shenyang, with only seven higher vocational schools, six secondary vocational schools, and elementary technical schools, with more than 1,700 workers and cadres participating in studies. The other category includes vocational schools, secondary vocational schools, and ordinary middle schools, which enroll young intellectuals to train them to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. This type of school is developing rapidly. The city already has more than 150 such schools, enrolling 30,000 to 40,000 students. A dozen or twenty have already started classes. The schooling system lasts from one to three years. The curriculum generally includes politics, cultural studies, and technical theory courses. Most also adopt the part-work, part-study method, combining learning with labor. Students generally do not live on campus. After graduation, the schools are not responsible for job placement. If the factory or other units need people, they can give priority to hiring and recommending graduates, and students can also choose their careers or further education according to the principle of voluntarism.
    The reason why factories in Shenyang are vigorously establishing schools is driven by the new situation of the current Great Leap Forward in production and the technical revolution. Based on the needs of this new situation, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee has taken active measures since May this year, holding a series of meetings to implement the "walking on two legs" education policy, criticizing the superstitious idea that people engaged in industry cannot run education, as well as the conservative viewpoints of being afraid of trouble and unwilling to run schools, thus promoting the vigorous establishment of schools by various factories. The Party Committee secretaries of many factories also personally took action, quickly establishing various types of schools according to the conditions of their own factories.
    The factories in Shenyang have great potential, with strong manpower, material resources, and financial resources, providing sufficient conditions for vigorously establishing schools. The teachers, equipment, funding, and school buildings needed to build a new school are relatively easy to solve. In addition to the shortage of cultural teachers, political teachers and specialized course teachers can be concurrently held by the Party and government leaders and engineering and technical personnel of the factory. The workshop is the internship factory, without the need to add any equipment. School buildings can be squeezed out without spending much money to establish a school. The Shenyang Smelter recruited 1,000 students, and the annual recurring expenses and teachers' salaries only require 40,000 yuan. Therefore, some large factories with better conditions in Shenyang have established primary schools, middle schools, and universities, forming an education network within the factory. Some small and medium-sized factories and handicraft cooperatives have also independently or jointly established ordinary middle schools or vocational middle schools. Some factories with poor conditions have also run study classes, enrolling dozens of students. Many factories running part-work, part-study schools have made full use of the potential of factory spare-time schools. In the past few years, Shenyang has run more than 300 spare-time schools for workers. In the past, the potential of these schools had not been fully utilized. For example, Liming Machinery Factory originally had a complete spare-time education network from primary school to university, with more than 100 teachers and administrative cadres, and a relatively complete physics and chemistry laboratory. In the past, teachers taught an average of eight classes per week, up to a maximum of twelve classes. Now, without adding equipment and manpower, the factory has established a part-work, part-study engineering college, secondary vocational school, elementary technical school, ordinary middle school, and old cadre class on the basis of the spare-time school, enrolling 700 workers, cadres, and children of employees.
    Factories running schools is one of the important forms of realizing the policy of combining education with labor, and it is also an important method of gradually combining physical labor and mental labor. Absorbing workers to participate in part-work, part-study schools can quickly cultivate a working-class intellectual force. The part-work, part-study schools of Liming Machinery Factory take up two hours of work time and two hours of spare time for study every day, which is an increase of eighteen hours per week compared to studying at spare-time schools. In the past, the spare-time engineering college had a six-year system, but now it only takes three years with part-work, part-study, but the scientific and technological knowledge learned is not lower than that of general higher vocational schools. At the same time, they are students and laborers, and the knowledge they learn can be applied and verified immediately, which is conducive to improving cultural and technical levels and promoting the development of production. Factories running ordinary middle schools and vocational middle schools have superior conditions in cultivating young people to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. The tractor school run by Shenyang Machine Factory enrolled 300 junior high school graduates. After the school started, the students saw that the factory and school were very simple. At the same time, some students did not plan to go to the countryside as tractor drivers, so they did not study with peace of mind. Later, they learned that in such a simple factory, the employees had successfully trial-produced tractors with strong will, and they were deeply educated. Therefore, 90% of the students studied with peace of mind. (Attached picture)

### 知识分子工农化　劳动人民知识化  工厂办学的潜力很大  沈阳各工厂办了学校一百六十九所

    知识分子工农化　劳动人民知识化
    工厂办学的潜力很大
    沈阳各工厂办了学校一百六十九所
    本报讯　记者温述仙、姚桂兰报道：沈阳市一百多个工厂大办学校，在短短的三个月内，就举办了一百六十九所高等和中等专业学校、职业中学和普通中学，计划招收四万八千多名学生。
    这些工厂举办的学校基本上分为两类。一类是半工半读学校，吸收本厂工人和干部入学，培养知识化的工人阶级队伍。目前这类学校在沈阳还不多，只有七所高等专业学校，六所中等专业学校和初等技术学校，有一千七百多名工人和干部参加学习。另一类是职业学校、中等专业学校和普通中学，招收青年知识分子入学，培养他们成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这类学校发展很快，全市已有一百五十多所，招收三、四万名学生，目前开学的已有一、二十所；学制为一年到三年；课程一般有政治、文化和技术理论课；多半也采用半工半读的方法，使学习和劳动相结合；学生一般不住校；毕业以后，学校不负责分配工作，如果工厂和别的单位用人，可以优先录用和推荐，学生也可以按自愿原则选择职业或升学。
    沈阳市各工厂所以要大办学校，是由当前生产大跃进、技术大革命的新形势促成的。根据这种新形势的需要，中共沈阳市委从今年5月以来，采取了积极措施，举行一系列会议，贯彻“两条腿走路”的教育方针，批判了认为搞工业的人不能办教育的迷信思想，以及怕麻烦、不愿意办学的保守观点，推动各工厂大办学校。许多工厂的党委书记也亲自动手，根据本厂的条件，迅速举办各种类型的学校。
    沈阳市各工厂的潜力很大，人力、物力、财力雄厚，大办学校是有充分条件的。新建一所学校需要的师资、设备、经费和校舍等，都比较容易解决。除了缺少文化教员之外，政治教员和专业课教员可以由本厂的党、政领导干部和工程技术人员兼任；车间就是实习工厂，不用增添什么设备；校舍可以挤出来，不花多少钱，就办成了学校。沈阳冶炼厂招收一千名学生，全年的经常费用和教师工资等，只需四万元就够开支。所以沈阳一些条件较好的大工厂，建立了小学、中学和大学，在工厂里形成一个教育网；一些中小型工厂和手工业合作社，也都单独或联合举办了普通中学或职业中学；有些条件不好的工厂，也办了学习班，招收几十名学生。许多工厂举办半工半读学校，都充分利用工厂业余学校的潜力。几年来，沈阳市举办了职工业余学校三百多所。过去这些学校的潜力，都没有得到充分发挥。例如黎明机械厂原来就有一套从小学到大学的业余教育网，拥有教员和行政干部一百多人，有较完备的理化实验室。过去教员平均每周上八节课，最多十二节。现在，这个工厂不用增加设备和人力，就在业余学校的基础上举办了半工半读的工学院、中等专业学校、初等技术学校、普通中学和老干部班等，招收七百名工人、干部和职工子弟入学。
    工厂大办学校是实现教育与劳动相结合方针的重要形式之一，也是逐渐使得体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的一个重要方法。吸收工人参加半工半读学校，能够迅速培养出工人阶级知识分子队伍。黎明机械厂半工半读的学校每天占用工作时间两小时，业余时间两小时进行学习，比在业余学校学习的时间，每周增加了十八小时。业余工学院过去学制为六年，现在半工半读只需三年，但所学的科学技术知识，并不低于一般的高等专业学校。同时，他们是学生，又是劳动者，学到的知识马上能够运用和得到验证，既有利于文化技术水平的提高，又能促进生产的发展。工厂举办普通中学和职业中学，在培养青年成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者方面，具备了优越的条件。沈阳机器厂举办的拖拉机学校，招收了三百名初中毕业生。开学以后，学生们看到工厂、学校都很简陋；同时有一部分学生不打算到农村去当拖拉机手，因此学习不安心。后来他们知道就是在这样一个简陋的工厂里，职工们以坚强的意志试制成功了拖拉机，受到了深刻的教育，因此90％的学生都安心学习了。（附图片）
