　　Dulles Spreads Rumors

　　"I am surprised that the communiqué mentions that Russia and Communist China will launch independent movements in Latin America." - This is what Dulles said about the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué on the eve of his visit to Brazil.

　　"They talked about how they would lead the forces of liberation and independence throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America." - This is another statement Dulles made about the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué after arriving in Brazil.

　　However, the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué clearly states: China and the Soviet Union "firmly support the national independence movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." The so-called "launching" and "how to lead" are completely shameless slanders and smears by Dulles with ulterior motives.

　　The reason why Dulles wants to spread such rumors during his visit to Brazil is obviously to make people believe that there is no national independence movement in Latin America; that the national independence movement in Latin America is merely "launched" and "led" by China and the Soviet Union. In this way, Dulles not only slanders China and the Soviet Union and conceals the U.S. imperialist policy of plundering Latin America, but also greatly insults the struggle of the Latin American people to safeguard their independent sovereignty and oppose U.S. colonialism. It is particularly noteworthy that Dulles' deliberate slander also implies the U.S.'s intention to kill the independent movements in Latin America. According to Dulles' logic, since China and the Soviet Union "launched" and "led" the national independence movements in Latin America, the United States can send troops to Latin America at any time it deems appropriate to "stop foreign indirect aggression"!

　　In order to suppress the vigorously rising national independence movement in Latin America, the U.S. ruling group has spent a lot of effort and used various despicable means. This time Dulles has even resorted to the low-down trick of spreading rumors and slander, which shows that U.S. imperialism's situation in Latin America is getting worse and worse.

### 杜勒斯造谣

    杜勒斯造谣
    “我对公报中说到俄国和共产党中国要在拉丁美洲开展独立运动这一点感到惊奇。”——这是杜勒斯赴巴西访问前夕对中苏会谈公报的谈话。
    “他们谈到了他们将怎样领导整个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的解放和独立的力量。”——这是杜勒斯到巴西后对中苏会谈公报的又一次谈话。
    然而，在中苏会谈公报中，写得清清楚楚的是：中苏两国“坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动”。所谓“开展”和“怎样领导”云云，完全是杜勒斯别有用心的无耻诽谤和诬蔑。
    杜勒斯所以要在他访问巴西的时期造这样的谣，显然是梦想使人相信，似乎在拉丁美洲本来不存在什么民族独立运动；拉丁美洲的民族独立运动只不过是中苏两国去“开展”和“领导”的。这样，杜勒斯不仅诬蔑了中苏，掩盖了美国对拉丁美洲的帝国主义的掠夺政策，并且是对拉丁美洲各国人民维护独立主权和反对美国殖民主义的斗争的莫大侮辱。特别值得注意的是，杜勒斯的这种蓄意诽谤，还暗含着美国对拉丁美洲各国争取独立运动的杀机。按照杜勒斯的逻辑，既然中苏“开展”和“领导”了拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，美国就可以在它认为适当的时机，随时派兵去拉丁美洲“制止外来的间接侵略”了！
    为了镇压拉丁美洲蓬勃高涨的民族独立运动，美国统治集团已经费了不少心机，使用了多种卑鄙的手段。这回杜勒斯竟使出了造谣诽谤的下流手段，可见美帝国主义在拉丁美洲处境是越来越不妙了。
