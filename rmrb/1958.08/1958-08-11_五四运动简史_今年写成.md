　　“A Brief History of the May Fourth Movement” to be Written This Year

    Next year marks the fortieth anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. To commemorate this great historical event, the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is writing a "Brief History of the May Fourth Movement."

    The central idea of the "Brief History of the May Fourth Movement" is to clarify that the May Fourth Movement was the beginning of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, as well as the experiences and lessons of the ideological emancipation movement during the May Fourth period and its significance for the current socialist revolution and socialist construction. The book will be divided into four chapters: The Eve of the May Fourth Movement, The May Fourth Movement, The Further Development of the Ideological Emancipation Movement, and The Combination of Marxism and the Chinese Revolutionary Movement—The Founding of the Communist Party of China. At present, the central idea and outline of the "Brief History" have been determined, and the content of each chapter has been discussed. Detailed chapter outlines are being drafted, and it is expected that the entire book will be completed within the year.
