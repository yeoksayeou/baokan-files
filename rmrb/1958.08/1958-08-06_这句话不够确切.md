    This Statement Is Not Precise Enough
    In the article "Striving for the Upstream Means Striving for First Place" by Comrade Wang Pu, published on page three on July 11th, it said that Yu County "established industries on flat ground in a county where there... was no working class." This statement is not precise enough. If it said, "established industries on flat ground in a county where there... were no industrial workers," it might be more in line with the actual situation. Firstly, Yu County has an advanced force of the working class organization – the Party organization, which is the decisive condition for the farmers of Yu County to be able to establish industries on flat ground; secondly, Yu County also has handicraft laborers.

    这句话不够确切
    7月11日三版上登的王朴同志“争上游就是争第一”一文，说盂县“在……没有工人阶级的县里平地大办起工业来”。这句话不够确切。如果说，“在……没有产业工人的县里平地大办起工业来”，可能要符合实际情况些。因为第一、盂县有工人阶级组织的先进部队——党的组织，这是盂县农民能平地大办起工业来的决定性的条件；二、盂县还有手工业劳动者。
