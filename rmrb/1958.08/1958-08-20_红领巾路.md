　　Red Scarf Road
    Shaded by dense foliage and lined with rows of poplar trees, the three-li-long dirt road is as smooth as an asphalt road. At the north and south ends, there are signs with four large red characters written by the children themselves – “Red Scarf Road,” followed by "Lucheng Township, Daxing District, Beijing."

    During the height of autumn, tractors towing carts loaded with agricultural products constantly pass through here. City motorcades carrying machinery or daily necessities also pass through here.

    Drinking water barrels are placed along this road, supplied by the Red Scarves themselves. On the water barrels is written: "Comrade, you've worked hard! Please drink a cup of water from the Red Scarves!"

    People passing through here often stop to drink a couple of cups before continuing on their way.

    These two rows of poplar trees were also planted by the Red Scarves. To better protect the roadbed, the children often use stone rollers to compact it, so even during the rainy season, this road is not muddy.

　　红领巾路
    浓荫笼罩，杨树成行，三里多长的黄土路像沥青路一样平坦。北端和南端各有一个牌子，牌子上是孩子们自己写的四个大红字——“红领巾路”，下边是“北京市大兴区鹿圈乡”。
    在盛秋时节，这条路上每天都有拖拉机拖着装得满满的农产品的斗车，络绎不断地从这里经过。也有城里的汽车队载着机器或日用品从这里经过。
    在这条路上设有饮水桶，是红领巾自己供应的。在水桶上写着：“同志，你辛苦了！请喝一杯红领巾的水吧！”
    从这里经过的人们，往往都停下来畅饮两杯继续赶路。
    这两排杨树也是红领巾们栽下的。为了更好地保护路基，孩子们用碡石经常碾压，就是在雨季里，这条路也不泥泞。
