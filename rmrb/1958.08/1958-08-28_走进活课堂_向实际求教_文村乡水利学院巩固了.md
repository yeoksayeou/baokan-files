Entering the Living Classroom and Seeking Knowledge from Practice
Wen Village Township Water Conservancy College Consolidated

(Our Dispatch) Our reporter Chen Jian reports: The people-run Water Conservancy College in Wen Village Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, has achieved remarkable results in the past five months.

The Wen Village Township Water Conservancy College opened in March of this year. The first group of fifty students has already graduated; the second group of fifty students has been in class for more than two months, and the study time has been extended to one year. 90% of the students in both groups are commune members who have become literate. Graduates from this school can independently conduct surveying, design, site selection, and technical guidance during construction for medium and small-sized reservoirs; they can grasp the basic laws of soil erosion and understand the relationship between soil and water conservation work and agricultural production from scientific principles; scientifically master the complete set of design and construction guidance work for forty types of large and small projects such as valley dams and fish-scale pits in soil and water conservation work; and can also serve as "political instructors" on construction sites. Many townships and communes in the county have invited them to help guide the construction of reservoirs and soil and water conservation.

The school's learning is closely integrated with production. During the slack season, learning time is five hours in the morning and evening, and during the busy season, it is three hours every night. Students' labor time in the agricultural cooperative is no less than that of ordinary commune members every day. The main textbook is a booklet "Summary of Water Management Experience in Wen Village Township in Recent Years," personally led and written by the secretary of the township's CCP committee, in addition to irrigation science, soil and water conservation (including five projects: gully treatment, slope treatment, river treatment, reservoirs, and field work), soil science, algebra, arithmetic, and politics. Students and teachers go to the fields with books and instruments, learning and experimenting while working, and many projects that have already been done have been initially understood from a scientific point of view. In order to combine theoretical learning of gully and slope treatment, they have reclaimed eighty mu of barren mountains and river gullies that the commune members considered "infertile land," all planted with oil crops. It is estimated that this land can increase the income of the agricultural cooperative by more than 7,000 yuan this year. Students conduct theoretical learning of water conservancy projects in the fields and on construction sites. They hold books in one hand and instruments in the other, surveying and designing while learning. In the past five months, they have determined thirty reservoir sites, some of which have already started construction. Among them, the medium-sized reservoir that has been completed, with a storage capacity of 600,000 cubic meters, has solved the irrigation problem for half of the township's arable land because the determination of the dam site was based on scientific grounds and a living water source was found. They have also established a runoff experimental station on the hillside. When it rains, students gather here to experiment and study the size of the runoff, the soil erosion situation in the township, and the amount of water stored after the hillside is treated, so as to further carry out soil and water conservation work in the township.

The problem of teachers in this water conservancy college is mainly solved by relying on themselves. The teaching and research group is composed of excellent students Huang Yizhen, Li Tiedan, and branch secretary Niu Jinduo, with Huang Yizhen as the technical teacher. The teaching and research group also absorbs study group leaders to participate, and hires experienced old farmers in the township as technical consultants. The school sends teachers to neighboring counties' farmland water conservancy training classes to listen to technical courses. Recently, Zhang Guangyi, a researcher at the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, was also invited to teach at this school. Now, the teaching and research group has become the core of the school's unified political and technical leadership.

Every student here studies hard and rarely rests. Outstanding student Liu Gen writes algebraic equations and proportional numbers of engineering principles on his hands, ready to recite them at any time. The students of Wen Village Township Water Conservancy College are determined to climb the peak of cultural technology and become red experts as soon as possible.

### 走进活课堂　向实际求教  文村乡水利学院巩固了

　　走进活课堂　向实际求教
    文村乡水利学院巩固了
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省登封县文村乡群众自办的水利学院，五个多月以来取得了显著成绩。
    文村乡水利学院在今年3月开学。第一期五十名学员已经毕业；第二期五十名学员已开课两个多月，学习时间已延长为一年。两期学员90％都是脱盲以后的社员。从这所学校毕业出来的学员，都能单独进行中、小型水库的勘测、设计、选择库址和施工中的技术指导等工作；能掌握水土冲刷的基本规律和从科学原理上了解水土保持工作和农业生产的关系；科学地掌握水土保持工作中谷坊、鱼鳞坑等四十种大、小工程的全套设计和施工指导工作；还能担任工地的“政治指导员”。全县许多乡社都请他们去帮助指导修水库，搞水土保持。
    这个学校的学习紧密结合生产。农闲时，学习时间早晚五小时，农忙时每晚三小时，学员每天在农业社的劳动时间不少于一般社员。学习的主要课本是乡的中共党委书记亲自领导编写的“文村乡几年来治水经验总结”的小册子，另外有灌溉学、水土保持（包括治沟、治坡、治河、水库、田间等五项工程）、土壤、代数、算术、政治等。学员和教员下地带着书本和仪器，边劳动边学习试验，许多已经做过的工程都被初步提高到科学原理上来了解。为了结合治沟、治坡的理论学习，他们开出社员们认为“不毛之地”的荒山、河沟八十亩，全部种上油料作物，估计这块地今年可为农业社增加七千元以上的收入。学员们在野地里和工地上进行水利工程的理论学习。他们一手拿书本，一手拿仪器，边学习边进行勘测、设计。五个多月以来，他们确定了三十个水库库址，有些已经开工，其中已经修好的蓄水量达六十万公方的中型水库，由于确定坝址有了科学根据，找到了活的水源，解决了全乡一半耕地的灌溉问题。他们还在山坡上建立了径流试验站，下雨时，学员聚在这里试验，研究径流大小和本乡土地冲刷情况以及山坡治理后蓄水量大小的情况等，以便进一步开展本乡的水土保持工作。
    这所水利学院的师资问题主要依靠自己解决。教研组由优秀学生黄一振、李铁蛋和党支部书记牛金铎组成，由黄一振任技术教员。教研组还吸收学习小组长参加，并聘请乡里有治水经验的老农为技术顾问。学校派教员去邻县的农田水利训练班听技术课。最近，还请中国农业科学院农业机械研究所研究员张广义到这所学校任教。现在，教研组已成为全校政治和技术统一领导的核心。
    这里的学生个个都发奋苦学，很少休息。优秀学生刘根把代数方程式、工程原理上的比例数字写在手上，准备随时背诵。文村乡水利学院的学员们决心攀登文化技术的高峰，早日成为红色专家。
