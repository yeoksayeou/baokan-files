Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 24th: After receiving reports from the masses and conducting long-term investigations, the Guangdong public security organs recently arrested six Chiang gang secret agent elements in Shantou and Huangpu ports who were hiding on Hong Kong merchant ships flying the British flag: Xu Feng, Xu Guanzhen, Xu Xuan, Fu Sheng, Li Qing, and Pang Ben. These secret agents took advantage of the convenience of merchant ships sailing to and from our coastal ports to carry out various sabotage activities.

These secret agents were hidden on the Da Zhongshan, Da Bao Kang, Da Shun Kang, Da Bao Lai, and Da Nan Shan ships belonging to Hong Kong Shun Chang Shipping Company. Xu Feng, a secret agent belonging to the "Group One of the Southern Executive Department of the Central Committee" of the Chiang gang, used the alias Liang Shaoming and lurked in the boiler room of the Da Bao Kang ship. He used the convenience of this ship sailing to Shantou and other ports to collect our military intelligence and various books, newspapers, magazines, charts, and information about Party and government leaders, and reported to the Chiang gang's secret service. He also attempted to contact secret agents lurking on the mainland and develop a secret agent organization. Xu Guanzhen, also known as Xu Pao, a secret agent belonging to the "Hong Kong Group of the Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" of the Chiang gang, lurked on the Da Zhongshan, Da Shun Kang, and other ships, collecting information about Shantou and other places in our country, and reported to the Chiang gang's secret service in Hong Kong many times. In order to facilitate sabotage activities, this secret agent also followed the instructions of the secret service and found a woman in a photo studio in Shantou to marry as a cover.

Xu Xuan, a secret agent belonging to the "Southern Executive Department of the Central Committee" of the Chiang gang, repeatedly collected our military, political, and economic intelligence; later, he accepted the task of the secret service to secretly photograph our port facilities and waterways. The secret agent Fu Sheng hid on the Da Bao Lai ship and was responsible for contacting secret agents lurking on the mainland and transferring funds on behalf of the secret agents. The secret agents Li Qing and Pang Ben were couriers for the "Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" and the "Southern Executive Department of the Central Committee" of the Chiang gang. In addition to being responsible for transportation and liaison, they also actively collected our military and economic intelligence.

After being arrested, these secret agents confessed to joining secret agent organizations and receiving secret agent training in Hong Kong. The information they confessed shows that the US-Chiang secret service is using Hong Kong as a base to actively carry out sabotage activities against our coast and inland areas. This cannot but attract our great attention.

　　英国国旗下　蒋帮特务多
    广东公安部门从香港商船上拖出六个坏蛋
    新华社广州24日电　广东省公安机关根据群众检举并经过长期侦察证实以后，最近在汕头和黄埔港逮捕了六名隐藏在悬挂英国国旗的香港商船内的蒋帮特务分子：许逢、许观珍、许轩、符胜、李庆、庞本。这些特务分子利用商船行驶我沿海口岸的方便，进行各种破坏活动。
    这些特务分子分别隐藏在香港顺昌航业公司所属的大中山、大宝康、大顺康、大宝来、大南山等轮船上。属于蒋帮“中央委员会南方执行部一组”的特务分子许逢，化名梁少明，潜伏在大宝康轮船烧火部。他利用这条轮船行驶汕头等港口的方便，搜集我军事情报和各种书报、杂志、图表以及党、政领导人员的情况，向蒋帮特务机关汇报，还企图同潜伏在大陆上的特务分子取得联系并发展特务组织。属于蒋帮“国防部情报局香港组”的特务分子许观珍，又名许炮，先后潜伏在大中山、大顺康等轮船上，搜集我汕头等地的情况，多次向香港的蒋帮特务组织汇报。为了便于进行破坏活动，这个特务分子还按照特务机关的指示，在汕头找到一个照像馆的女人为妻，作为掩护。
    属于蒋帮“中央委员会南方执行部”的特务分子许轩，曾多次搜集我军事、政治、经济情报；后来又接受特务机关要他偷摄我各港口设备、航道的任务。特务分子符胜隐藏在大宝来轮船上，负责同潜伏在大陆上的特务分子联系并代特务分子转款。特务分子李庆和庞本是蒋帮“国防部情报局”和“中央委员会南方执行部”的交通员，他们除了负责交通联络外，还积极搜集我军事和经济情报。
    这些特务分子在被捕后，都供认了他们在香港参加特务组织和接受特务训练的情况。从他们供认的情况表明，美蒋特务机关正在以香港为基地，积极对我沿海和内地进行破坏活动。这不能不引起我们的极大注意。
