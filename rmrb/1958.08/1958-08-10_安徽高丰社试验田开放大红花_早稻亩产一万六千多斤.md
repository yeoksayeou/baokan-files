Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th August: Gaofeng Commune in Shima Township, Zongyang County, Anhui Province, has created a new record of high yield in early rice production, reaching 16,227 jin and 13 liang per mu. This record surpasses the 15,361 jin per mu achieved by Changfeng Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, by 866 jin and 13 liang.

This 1.042 mu of early rice field was collectively cultivated as an experimental field by the Shima Township Party Committee and the Gaofeng Commune Party Branch. The rice seeds used were the "Da Ye Zao" (Big Leaf Early) improved variety, known for its sturdy stalks, long ears, fertilizer tolerance, and resistance to lodging. The field was deeply ploughed to a depth of one chi (foot), with a dense planting pattern of 2x3 cun (inches). In addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer, the field was top-dressed three times with over 300 jin of superphosphate, weeded three times promptly, and the field was dried three times. Consequently, the rice plants grew exceptionally vigorously, with approximately 110,000 clumps and 2.4 million ears per mu, filled with plump grains.

The harvest began at 11:00 AM on the 7th. Those who participated in supervising the harvest and threshing included: Zhang Shirong, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee; responsible persons from the Anqing Prefectural Committee and the Zongyang County Committee; Yin Hongzhang, leader of the Shanghai All-Circles Anhui Agricultural Production Visiting Group and Deputy Director of the Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with deputy leaders Liu Jingji, Liu Liangmo, and over fifty members; Zhou Jiejang, leader of the Sichuan-Guizhou Rice Visiting Group and Section Chief of the Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Department of the Jiangjin Special Prefecture in Sichuan, along with deputy leader Ma Jianyou, Director of the Luzhou Special District Agricultural Science Institute, and thirty-seven members; and Xu Changkang, leader of the Sixth Branch of the Anhui Provincial Political Consultative Conference Agricultural Visiting Group and professor at Anhui Agricultural College, along with ninety-one members. Prior to the harvest, representatives selected by each visiting group formed four groups for measuring, supervising the harvest and threshing, supervising transportation, and weighing, with approximately ten people in each group. The measuring group carefully measured the land before the harvest and re-measured it after the harvest, proving that the field was 1 mu, 4 li, and 2 hao, without error. During the harvest, the entire commune mobilized over 300 members to harvest, thresh, and transport simultaneously. It took until 6:30 PM to completely harvest the early rice from this field. After an initial threshing, it was threshed again on the morning of the 8th, yielding a total of 16,909 jin and 6 liang of dry grain.

After the harvest and weighing, the commune immediately held a celebration meeting. When the harvest supervision and weighing group finally announced the yield, the entire venue immediately erupted in the sound of gongs, drums, firecrackers, and cheers. At the celebration meeting, the leaders of each visiting group and Zhang Shirong, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered speeches. They unanimously congratulated Gaofeng Commune on the great victory of launching a high-yield early rice "satellite." Each delegation presented flags to Gaofeng Commune at the celebration. Finally, Min Chuanrong, Secretary of the Shima Township Party Committee, spoke, expressing that they would never be arrogant or complacent and were determined to strive for an even greater bumper harvest of late rice.

    安徽高丰社试验田开放大红花
    早稻亩产一万六千多斤
    新华社合肥9日电　安徽省枞阳县石马乡高丰社创造了早稻亩产一万六千二百二十七斤十三两的高额丰产新纪录。这个纪录与湖北省孝感县长风社早稻亩产一万五千三百六十一斤比较，超过八百六十六斤十三两。
    这块早稻田共一点零四二亩，是石马乡党委和高丰社党支部集体培养的试验田。稻种是选用的秆硬、穗长、耐肥、不易倒伏的“大叶早”良种。深耕一尺，2×3寸密植。这块田除施足基肥以外，以后又追施了三次过磷酸钙三百多斤，并及时耘草三次，烤田三次。因此稻株长得特别旺盛。每亩约有十一万蔸，二百四十万穗，颗粒饱满。
    7日上午十一时开始收割时，参加监收监打的有：中共安徽省委农村工作部部长张世荣、安庆地委和枞阳县委的负责人；上海各界人士安徽省农业生产参观团团长、中国科学院植物生理研究所副所长殷宏章，副团长刘靖基、刘良模和团员五十多人；四川、贵州水稻参观团团长、四川江津专署农林水利科科长周捷将，副团长、泸州专区农业科学研究所所长马建猷等和团员三十七人；政协安徽省农业参观团第六分团团长、安徽农学院教授徐长康和团员九十一人。收割以前，由各参观团选出代表组成了丈量、监收监打、监运和过秤等四个小组，每个小组有十人左右。丈量小组在收割以前仔细丈量了土地，收割以后又复丈一次，证明这块田是一亩零四厘二毫，没有错误。收割时，全社共组织社员三百余人，边收、边打、边运，直到下午六时半才将这块田的早稻全部割完，初打一遍，8日上午又打一遍，共收干谷一万六千九百零九斤六两。
    收割过秤以后，这个社随即召开了一个庆祝会，当监收监打和过秤小组最后宣布产量时，全场立即响起了锣鼓声、鞭炮声和欢呼声。在庆祝会上，各参观团的负责人和省委农村工作部部长张世荣等都讲了话，他们一致祝贺高丰社发射早稻高产“卫星”的伟大胜利。各代表团在庆祝会上向高丰社献了旗。最后石马乡党委书记闵传荣讲话，他表示决不骄傲，决不自满，一定争取晚稻获得更大的丰收。
