Let Scrap Steel Join the Great Leap Forward
Liaoning Industry's "Drought Resistance" Movement is Energetic and Effective
(Our newspaper Shenyang, 28th) Liaoning Province's industrial "drought resistance" movement has achieved brilliant results. Currently, the province has unearthed more than 260,000 tons of scrap steel, greatly alleviating the tight situation of insufficient steel supply. Many factories and mines can over fulfill their production leap forward plans without the state allocating steel.

On July 4th, the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, based on the experience of Lushun-Dalian and Shenyang, decided to launch an industrial "drought resistance" movement throughout the province. Party committee secretaries took the lead, personally leading more than 2,000 industrial "drought resistance" headquarters, forming a "drought resistance" army of more than 5 million people, searching and excavating steel everywhere from cities to villages, from above ground to underground. Lushun-Dalian City has unearthed more than 40,000 tons of scrap steel. Shenyang City spent just over a month unearthing more than 70,000 tons of scrap steel and more than 18,000 pieces of equipment. The broad masses of farmers and urban residents sold incense burners, iron braziers and other scrap metal to the state. The amount of scrap steel purchased in two months is equal to the total amount purchased in the past three years.

Currently, all counties in the province are relying on the scrap steel they have excavated to manufacture thousands of sets of ball bearings. All local industrial systems, except for a few steel plates and steel pipes, have basically solved the raw material difficulties. State-owned factories and mines can also rely on their own efforts to solve a large part of the steel they lack. When Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory just proposed the fighting goal of doubling its output this year, some people said: "How can output be doubled if more than 10,000 tons of steel are missing?" Now, through the "drought resistance" movement, this factory has unearthed thousands of tons of scrap steel, not only ensuring production needs in a timely manner, but also increasing production by dozens of locomotives more than the original leap forward plan. Dalian Steel Plant, Dalian Crane Factory, and Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory have also revised their leap forward plans and are moving towards higher targets. Shenyang Cement Repair Factory once suspended production due to insufficient steel supply; now it has not only resumed normal production, but also increased production. In the "Five Excavations" movement, Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant repeatedly overfulfilled the state plan and also transferred more than 200 tons of steel to support other factories.

At present, Liaoning Province's industrial "drought resistance" movement is still developing in depth. This is an important guarantee for the completion of the province's industrial production leap forward plan. The problem now is to maintain the momentum, prevent complacency, and deeply excavate more scrap steel. The excavated scrap steel should be adjusted, shared, and guaranteed to meet the needs of completing the national production plan.

　　让废钢铁投入跃进行列
    辽宁工业“抗旱”运动劲头足效果大
    本报沈阳28日电　辽宁省工业“抗旱”运动战果辉煌。现在，全省已经挖出二十六万多吨废钢铁，大大缓和了钢材供应不足的紧张形势。许多厂矿不要国家调拨钢材，也都可以超额完成生产跃进计划。
    7月4日，中共辽宁省委和辽宁省人民委员会根据旅大、沈阳的经验，决定在全省范围内开展工业“抗旱”运动以后，各地党委书记挂帅，亲自领导二千多个工业“抗旱”指挥部，组成五百多万人参加的“抗旱”大军，从城市到乡村，从地上到地下，到处寻找和挖掘钢铁。旅大市挖出的废钢铁已达四万多吨。沈阳市只花一个多月功夫，就挖出七万多吨废钢铁、一万八千多台设备。广大农民和城市居民纷纷把香炉、铁火盘等废铜烂铁卖给国家。两个月时间废钢铁的收购量，等于过去三年收购量的总和。
    现在，全省各县正在依靠自己挖掘到的废钢铁，制造成千上万套滚珠轴承。所有地方工业系统，除了少数钢板、钢管而外，都基本上解决了原材料困难。各个国营厂矿所缺少的钢材，也能自力更生，解决一大部分。大连机车车辆厂在刚刚提出今年产量增一番的奋斗目标时，有人说：“缺少上万吨钢材，产量怎么能翻上去？”现在，这个厂通过“抗旱”运动，挖出几千吨废钢铁，不但及时保证了生产需要，还要比原订跃进计划多增产几十台机车。大连钢厂、大连起重机厂和大连工矿车辆厂，也都修改跃进计划，向更高的指标迈进。沈阳水泥修配厂曾经因为钢材供应不足，一度停产；现在不但恢复了正常生产，而且要多增加生产。东北机器制造厂在“五挖”运动中，一再超额完成国家计划，还调出二百多吨钢铁支援其他工厂。
    目前，辽宁省的工业“抗旱”运动还在深入发展。这对全省工业生产跃进计划的完成是个重要保证。今后的问题是：要一鼓作气，防止松懈情绪，深入挖掘更多的废钢铁。对于已经挖出的废钢铁，要加以调剂，互通有无，保证完成国家生产计划的需要。
