Adenauer's Dream

　　He Jun

In the quiet of night in Bonn, Adenauer fell into a deep sleep, and in his slumber received a telegram, signed by Hitler himself. The telegram's words were clear and precise: "Many greetings to my old friend, Prime Minister! Thinking back to those miserable days, the flames of the Berlin fire raged fiercely, alas, my bones are nowhere to be found, Göring and the others were sentenced to hang! My lifelong ambitions have been washed away, and the Nazi party is on the verge of extinction! Thanks to those British and American allies, and your strong support, nurturing my Nazi descendants, enduring over a decade of hardship. Now, the moment of lifting the ban has arrived, like releasing a tiger from its cage. From now on, I can rest in peace, for Fascism has endless successors. Please accept my respect, the Nazi salute! I should stop writing here, but I feel uneasy in my heart: I gambled away everything in my day, playing with war and burying myself in a pit of fire! You are following in my footsteps today, what will the future hold for you, good or bad? Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder, and joy turns to sorrow. From the depths of the underworld, I offer a thousand prayers and ten thousand blessings, may God protect you, old friend!" (Attached picture)

    阿登纳的梦
    禾君波恩城夜深人静，阿登纳沉沉入梦，朦胧中接到电报，希特勒亲笔签名。电报上字明句清：“多拜上总理老兄！想当年凄惨光景，柏林城大火熊熊，可怜我尸骨无存，戈林等被判绞刑！平生志付与流水，纳粹党眼看绝种！多亏那英美盟友，还有您大力支撑，扶持我纳粹子孙，十余年惨淡经营。到如今一声解禁，好比那放虎出笼。从今后我已瞑目，法西斯后继无穷。请接受在下敬意，举手礼纳粹遗风！到这里本该停笔，忽觉得心中不宁：我当年赌光输净，玩战火葬身火坑！您今日步我后尘，前途上是吉是凶？想到此不寒而栗，不由我喜散愁生。九泉下千祝万祷，愿上帝保佑老兄！”（附图片）
