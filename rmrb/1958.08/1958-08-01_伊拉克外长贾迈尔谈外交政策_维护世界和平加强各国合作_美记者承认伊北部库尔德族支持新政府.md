Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 30th: Iraqi Foreign Minister Abdul Jabbar Jamal told a reporter from the Syrian "National Newspaper" that Iraq's foreign policy is the same as that of the United Arab Republic.

Jamal said, "In order to maintain world peace and prevent mankind from suffering the scourge of war, we hope to cooperate with all countries in the world. We also hope to be friendly with all countries, whether they are Eastern or Western, and to make this friendship beneficial to us in terms of industry and trade." He also said, "Those countries that wish to exchange diplomatic representatives with us are welcome. And the diplomatic representatives of those countries that have not yet recognized our country are welcome to stay as long as they wish, because we believe that everything will be as we hope, and our relations with them can continue uninterrupted."

When Jamal spoke with the Syrian "National Newspaper" reporter about relations with the United Arab Republic, he said, "Without a doubt, you have already heard about the joint defense agreement we signed with the United Arab Republic in Damascus. Our relations with our sister republic are the best. We are moving forward together to serve the Arab nation."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th: "Al-Ahram" reported today that the Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, Rawi, has announced his allegiance to the Republic of Iraq.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: New York News: The "New York Times" published a dispatch on the 28th from its special correspondent Foster Hailey from Kirkuk, Iraq, acknowledging that the situation in northern Iraq is stable and that the Kurdish people there support the new Iraqi government.

The dispatch, sent on July 26, said that Brigadier General Nazim Tabaqshali, the military commander of northern Iraq, said after returning from a two-hour inspection of his defense zone, "Northern Iraq is completely loyal to the new government. The army and the people welcome the revolution with joy."

Tabaqshali's defense zone includes the two oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, as well as Sulaymaniyah, the Kurdish population center in the eastern mountainous area near the Iranian border.

The report said that, certainly, in Kirkuk, in Mosul, and in the messages coming from Sulaymaniyah, in the messages coming from the surrounding countryside, or in the messages coming from the Iraqi Petroleum Company's massive refinery outside Kirkuk, there was no indication that the situation was contrary to what he said.

The report quoted Lee Dinsmore, the U.S. Consul in Kirkuk, as saying that, to his knowledge, all 300 Americans in his consular district were safe and sound. He said that the reports he had received indicated that the entire area was calm and that activities were normal.

The report said that Edward Sannoulou, the British manager of the Iraqi Petroleum Company's subsidiary in Kirkuk responsible for production, also said that the company's oil production had not been interrupted for a minute.

The dispatch also quoted a Kurdish leader as saying that people coming down from the mountains told him that the Kurds there supported the revolution. The report said that the Executive Committee of the Kurdish Party had written a letter to General Tabaqshali guaranteeing their loyalty.

    美记者承认伊北部库尔德族支持新政府
    新华社巴格达30日电　伊拉克外交部长阿卜杜勒·贾巴尔·贾迈尔对叙利亚“国家报”记者说，伊拉克的外交政策同阿拉伯联合共和国的外交政策是一样的。
    贾迈尔说，“为了维护世界和平和防止人类遭受战争祸害，我们希望同世界各国合作。我们也希望同一切国家不管是东方国家还是西方国家友好，并且使得这种友谊在我们的工业和贸易方面获得好处”。他还说，“那些希望同我们交换外交代表的国家是受欢迎的。而现在还没有承认我国的那些国家的外交代表们愿意呆多久就呆多久，因为我们相信一切都会像我们所希望的那样，我们同他们的关系可以继续不间断。”
    贾迈尔同叙利亚“国家报”记者谈到同阿拉伯联合共和国关系的时候说，毫无疑问，你已经听到了我们在大马士革同阿拉伯联合共和国签订的共同防御协定。我们同我们的姊妹共和国的关系是最好的。我们在一起前进为阿拉伯民族服务。
    新华社开罗30日电　“金字塔报”今天报道，伊拉克驻土耳其大使拉维宣布他效忠伊拉克共和国。
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”28日刊载的它的特派记者福斯特·黑利从伊拉克的基尔库克发回的一篇电讯承认，伊拉克北部局势稳定，那里的库尔德族支持伊拉克新政府。
    这篇在7月26日发出的电讯说，伊拉克北部军事长官纳齐姆·塔巴克沙利准将在他的防区进行了两小时的视察回来后说，“伊拉克北部是完全忠于新政府的。军队和人民都以欢欣的心情欢迎革命。”
    塔巴克沙利的防区包括基尔库克和摩苏尔这两个石油城市以及在伊朗边境附近东部山区的库尔德族聚居中心苏莱曼尼亚。
    消息说，肯定地，在基尔库克，在摩苏尔和苏莱曼尼亚传来的消息中，在四周乡间传来的消息中，或者在基尔库克郊外伊拉克石油公司规模巨大的炼油厂传来的消息中都没有迹象表明情况同他所说的相反。
    消息援引美国驻基尔库克领事李·丁斯莫尔的话说，就他所知，在他的领事区内的三百名美国人都平安无恙。他所接到的报告都说，整个地区平静无事，活动正常。
    消息说，伊拉克石油公司在基尔库克负责生产的附属公司英国经理爱德华·桑诺娄也说，这家公司石油生产一分钟也没有中断。
    这条电讯还援引一位库尔德族领袖的话说，从山区下来的人告诉他，那里的库尔德人都支持革命。消息说，库尔德党执行委员会曾经写信给塔巴克沙利将军，保证效忠。
