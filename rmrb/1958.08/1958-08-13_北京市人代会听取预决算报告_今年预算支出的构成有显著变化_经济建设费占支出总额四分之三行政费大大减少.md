Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- The First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress opened in the CPPCC Auditorium on the 12th.

At 8:40 a.m., Mayor Peng Zhen announced the opening of the conference.

Vice Mayor of Beijing Zhang Youyu delivered a report at today's meeting on the final accounts of Beijing's financial revenue and expenditure in 1957 and the draft budget for financial revenue and expenditure in 1958. He said that the execution of Beijing's financial revenue and expenditure budget in 1957 was good. The results of the implementation ensured the overfulfillment of last year's national economic plan and the smooth progress of various tasks. Zhang Youyu then spoke about the 1958 financial revenue and expenditure budget, pointing out that in order to build the capital into a modern industrial base and a modern city, both budget revenue and expenditure have greatly increased in 1958, and the focus of expenditure is primarily on industrial investment. This year's expenditure on local industry has increased by 6.72 times compared to last year, expenditure on urban public utilities supporting industrial construction has increased by 87.55%, expenditure on education has increased by 14%, and expenditure on administrative management has decreased by 7.4%. The report said: There have been significant changes in the composition of this year's budget expenditure. Economic construction expenditure has increased from 46.71% of total expenditure last year to 75.98%; administrative management expenditure has decreased from 13.63% to 5.49%, and the absolute number has also decreased by 2.08 million yuan.

Subsequently, Vice Mayor Cheng Hongyi delivered a report on reforming commercial work, detailing how Beijing's commercial work further serves production, the great leap forward in commerce and service industries, the adjustment of the commercial network, and the reform of business management, and put forward the tasks of commercial work in the future. Cheng Hongyi said: Although the reform of commerce and service industries in Beijing has achieved great results, it is still not enough when measured against the standards of the general line for socialist construction, and has not yet reached the higher level that socialist commerce should have and is also capable of achieving. Therefore, there must be no slightest complacency, and we must promote the continued leap forward in the work of the city's commerce and service industries.

Six hundred and nine representatives attended today's meeting. In the afternoon, the representatives divided into groups to discuss the two reports. The meeting will continue.

    新华社12日讯　北京市第三届人民代表大会第一次会议12日在政协礼堂开幕。
    上午八时四十分，彭真市长宣布大会开幕。
    北京市副市长张友渔在今天的会上作了关于北京市1957年财政收支决算和1958年财政收支预算草案的报告。他说，1957年北京市财政收支预算的执行情况是良好的。执行的结果，保证了去年国民经济计划的超额完成和各项工作的顺利进行。张友渔接着谈到1958年的财政收支预算，他指出，为了把首都建设成为一个现代化的工业基地和一个现代化的城市，1958年预算收支都大大增加了，而支出的重点首先是工业的投资，今年用于地方工业的支出比去年增加六点七二倍，用于配合工业建设的城市公用事业支出增加87.55％，教育方面支出增加14％，行政管理费支出则减少7.4％。报告说：今年预算支出的构成有了显著的变化。经济建设费由去年占支出总额的46.71％上升为75.98％；行政管理费由13.63％下降为5.49％，绝对数也减少二百零八万元。
    大会接着由副市长程宏毅作关于改革商业工作的报告，他详细地报告了北京市商业工作进一步为生产服务，商业、服务业的跃进，调整商业网和改革经营管理的情况，提出了今后商业工作的任务。程宏毅说：北京市商业、服务行业的改革工作，虽然已经取得了很大的成绩，但是用建设社会主义总路线的标准来衡量还是不够的，还没有达到社会主义商业应有的、同时也是可能达到的更高水平，因此，绝不能有丝毫的骄傲自满，要推动全市商业、服务行业工作的继续跃进。
    出席今天会议的有六百零九位代表。下午代表们分成小组讨论这两个报告。会议将继续举行。
