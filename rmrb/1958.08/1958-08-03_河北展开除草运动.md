Hebei Launches Weed Eradication Campaign

    (Report from this newspaper) A large-scale weed eradication and wasteland reclamation campaign is gradually unfolding in Hebei. This is a new measure taken by the people of Hebei, following their victory over the drought, to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops and to simultaneously engage in flood control.
    Since mid-July, Hebei has experienced widespread and thorough rainfall. With the relief of the drought, weeds have sprung up everywhere, with some fields exhibiting the phenomenon of weeds growing at the same height as the crops. In some areas, due to a shortage of labor, there have even been instances of crop neglect due to the weeds. Therefore, a field management campaign centered on cultivating, weeding, and eliminating wasteland is rapidly unfolding throughout the province. In the Baoding Special District, the number of people participating in field management after the rain reached over 2.8 million, exceeding the total labor force of the district by more than 500,000. In the Zhangjiakou Special District, where there is a large land area but a small labor force, the masses were mobilized to convert weeding hoes into weeding hoe carts, increasing weeding efficiency by two to three times.

    河北展开除草运动
    本报讯　一个规模巨大的除草灭荒运动正在河北各地逐步展开。这是河北人民在战胜干旱以后为保证秋季作物全面丰收和防汛斗争同时进行的又一个新的措施。
    7月中旬以来河北普降透雨。随着干旱现象的解除，大地杂草丛生，有些禾田中出现了草苗齐长的现象，有些地区因劳力不足竟出现了苗荒现象。因此一个以中耕除草灭荒为中心的田间管理运动，正在全省迅速展开。保定专区雨后参加田间管理的人数达到了二百八十多万人，超过全区劳力总数五十多万人。地多劳力少的张家口专区发动群众把耘锄改装成耘锄车，锄地效率提高了两三倍。
