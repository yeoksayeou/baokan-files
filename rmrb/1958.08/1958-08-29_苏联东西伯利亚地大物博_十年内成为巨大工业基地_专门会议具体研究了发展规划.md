Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet Union is embarking on a vigorous development of the resources of Eastern Siberia, preparing to build the region into a very important Soviet base for metallurgy, electric power, coal mining, chemicals, and wood and paper industries in the next ten years. The Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Soviet State Planning Committee, and the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation jointly held a meeting in Irkutsk starting on the 18th of this month. The meeting specifically studied the allocation and development of the national economy of Eastern Siberia, and also determined the direction of scientific research to be carried out in the development of the region's productive forces in the next fifteen to twenty years. Approximately 2,500 people participated in the meeting, which closed on the 26th.

Academician Bardin, Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the Development of Productive Forces of Eastern Siberia, Graffov, Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the Russian Federation, and Kostandov, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Chemical Committee, delivered reports on the development of the national economy of Eastern Siberia at the meeting. These reports revealed encouraging prospects for the development of Eastern Siberia.

The reporters pointed out that compared with last year, the amount of coal mined here during the upcoming Seven-Year Plan, starting next year, will increase by almost one-fold, electricity by almost four and a half-fold, man-made and synthetic fibers by thirteen-fold, and sawn timber by more than one-fold. The output of ore will also increase many-fold. In the next seven years, Eastern Siberia will reclaim at least two million hectares of wasteland. The production of milk, meat, and wool will increase by one to two-fold. In addition, the construction industry and transportation industry will also achieve rapid and comprehensive development.

The reporters pointed out that inexhaustible power resources and abundant mineral resources are favorable conditions for the rapid development of industry in Eastern Siberia in the future. The huge hydroelectric power stations to be built in the next few years include the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station on the Yenisei River, the world's largest with a power generation capacity of 4 million kilowatts, and the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station on the Angara River with a power generation capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts. At the same time, a number of giant thermal power plants with a power generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts will also be built. The completion of these giant power plants will play an important role in establishing a unified Siberian power grid and a unified Soviet power grid. With the development of the power industry, the railways in Eastern Siberia will also be fully electrified.

The reporters pointed out that during the Seven-Year Plan, the basic construction investment in Eastern Siberia will be mainly used to develop the iron and steel industry, aluminum industry, coal mining and chemical industry enterprises, as well as oil processing industry and wood and paper industry enterprises. In addition, the diamond mining industry in the Yakut Autonomous Republic will also achieve rapid development.

At the meeting on the 26th, Academician Nemchinov, Chairman of the Productivity Research Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, made a concluding speech. He pointed out that three steel factories will be built in Siberia in the next seven years. Together with the Karaganda Iron and Steel Combine currently being built in Kazakhstan, these factories can guarantee the realization of the instructions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on building the Soviet Union's third iron and steel industry base. This base can produce 15 million to 20 million tons of pig iron annually. After 1965, the Soviet Union's fourth iron and steel industry base will be established in the Transbaikal region of Eastern Siberia.

Academician Nemchinov said that this meeting provided a large amount of important information for formulating the fifteen-year long-term plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union until 1975. He said that according to the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) currently being formulated, two steel factories will be built in Western Siberia and one steel factory will be built in Eastern Siberia in the next seven years. In addition, powerful thermal power plants will be built in Nazarovsk in the Krasnoyarsk Territory and other places.

Reasonably, rapidly, and comprehensively developing Siberia's natural wealth is the cause of the entire Soviet people. There is no doubt that the Soviet people will solve this major task in the shortest historical period.

　　苏联东西伯利亚地大物博  十年内成为巨大工业基地
    专门会议具体研究了发展规划
    据新华社讯　苏联正在着手大力开发东西伯利亚的资源，预备在最近十年内，把这个地区建设成苏联一个非常重要的冶金、电力、采煤、化学和木材造纸工业基地。苏联科学院、苏联国家计划委员会和俄罗斯联邦部长会议，本月18日开始在伊尔库次克联合举行了一个会议，会上具体研究了东西伯利亚国民经济的配置和发展问题，还确定了最近十五年到二十年间在发展这一地区的生产力方面进行科学研究工作的方向。参加这次会议的约有二千五百人。这个会议已于26日闭幕。
    发展东西伯利亚生产力组织委员会主席巴尔金院士、俄罗斯联邦国家计划委员会主席格拉富夫、苏联国家化学委员会副主席科斯达多夫等都先后在会上作了关于发展东西伯利亚的国民经济问题的报告。从这些报告中可以看出东西伯利亚令人鼓舞的发展远景。
    报告人指出，和去年比较，在从明年开始的七年计划期间，这里的采煤量就将增加差不多一倍，电力差不多增加四倍半，人造纤维和合成纤维十三倍，锯材一倍以上。矿砂产量也将增加好多倍。在今后七年间，东西伯利亚最少还将开垦二百万公顷荒地。牛奶、肉类和羊毛的生产将增加一到二倍。此外，建筑工业和交通运输业也将获得迅速的和全面的发展。
    报告人指出，用之不尽的动力资源和丰富的矿物原料资源是东西伯利亚工业今后获得迅速发展的有利条件。在今后几年间将建成的巨大水电站，有叶尼塞河上发电能力为四百万瓩的世界最大的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站和安加拉河上发电能力为三百六十万瓩的布拉次克水电站。同时，还要建成一些发电能力达二百四十万瓩的巨型火力发电站。这些巨型发电站的建成将对建立西伯利亚统一电力网和苏联统一电力网起重要作用，而随着电力工业的发展，东西伯利亚的铁路也将全面电气化。
    报告人指出，在七年计划期间，东西伯利亚的基本建设投资将主要用来发展钢铁工业、制铝工业、采煤和化学工业企业以及石油加工工业和木材造纸工业企业。此外，雅库特自治共和国的金刚石开采工业也将获得很快的发展。
    在26日的会议上，苏联科学院生产力研究委员会主席涅姆钦诺夫院士做了总结发言。他指出，今后七年间西伯利亚将要建成三个钢铁工厂。这些工厂同目前正在哈萨克建设的卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂一起，就可以保证实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于建设苏联第三个钢铁工业基地的指示。这个基地每年可以生产一千五百万吨到两千万吨生铁。1965年以后，在东西伯利亚的外贝加尔地区还将建立苏联第四个钢铁工业基地。
    涅姆钦诺夫院士说，这次会议为制订到1975年为止的苏联发展国民经济十五年远景计划提供了大量重要的资料。他说，根据正在制定的七年计划（1959—1965年），今后七年间在西西伯利亚将要建成两个钢铁工厂，在东西伯利亚要建成一个钢铁工厂。此外，在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区的纳扎罗夫斯克等地还要建设强大的火力发电站。
    合理地、迅速地、全面地开发西伯利亚的自然财富是全体苏联人民的事业。毫无疑问，苏联人一定会在最短的历史时期内解决这个重大的任务。
