Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: TASS, New York, August 6th: It is announced here that the United Nations Security Council will hold a meeting at 3:00 PM New York time on August 7th to discuss the issue of convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: Washington News: Following the Soviet government's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, State Department officials intensively studied the Soviet proposal on the 5th. Under Secretary of State Herter telephoned Secretary of State Dulles, who is currently visiting Brazil, for consultations. US President Eisenhower summoned Herter to discuss the Soviet proposal with him.

The White House then issued a statement on the Soviet proposal. The statement did not dare to reject the Soviet proposal, but it indicated that the US government would adopt various methods to undermine the discussion of the issue of US and British troop withdrawal at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. The statement said that the United States considers "a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to be entirely acceptable, particularly because the United States had already recommended such a procedure to the Security Council on July 18th." The US government will "instruct the US Permanent Representative to the Security Council to submit a proposal previously made by the United States, requesting that this proposal be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion."

The proposal put forward by the United States in the Security Council on July 18th was to request an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the so-called "interference in Lebanese internal affairs" by the United Arab Republic. The United States is now re-introducing this unfounded and repeatedly disproven allegation of the so-called "interference in Lebanese internal affairs" by the United Arab Republic by the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon, apparently in order to confuse right and wrong, and obstruct and undermine the discussion of the immediate withdrawal of US and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Under the instructions of the US government, US Representative to the United Nations Lodge stated on the 5th that the United States agreed to convene the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, he also indicated that he would play tricks on procedural issues, demanding that the Security Council emergency meeting "as soon as possible" give priority to voting on submitting the US's false accusation against the UAR to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: London News: A British Foreign Office spokesman stated at a press conference on the 6th that the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly is acceptable to the British government. However, the spokesman revealed that Britain has no sincerity in discussing the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan at the UN General Assembly special session. He sophistically argued, "Britain will not favor the discussion of the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by the General Assembly, because there is no such aggression."

The spokesman also said that the British government's official reply would be issued "soon," and Britain is prepared to support the US proposal to the UN General Assembly special session falsely accusing the United Arab Republic of so-called interference in Lebanon.

### 安理会今天讨论开联大紧急会议问题  美英企图转移目标诬告阿联“干涉黎巴嫩内政”

    安理会今天讨论开联大紧急会议问题
    美英企图转移目标诬告阿联“干涉黎巴嫩内政”
    新华社6日讯  塔斯社纽约6日讯：这里宣布，8月7日纽约时间下午三时举行联合国安全理事会会议，讨论召开联合国大会紧急会议的问题。
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联政府提出召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题的建议后，国务院官员5日紧张地研究了苏联的建议。副国务卿赫脱打电话同目前正在巴西访问的国务卿杜勒斯进行了商谈。美国总统艾森豪威尔召见赫脱，同他讨论了苏联的建议。
    白宫接着就苏联的建议发表了一个声明，这个声明不敢拒绝苏联的建议，但是它表明美国政府将要采用种种手法来破坏联合国大会紧急会议对美英撤军问题的讨论。声明说，美国认为“联合国大会会议是完全可以接受的，特别是因为美国已经在7月18日向安理会建议采取这样一项程序”，美国政府将“指示美国驻安理会常任代表提出美国先前已经提出的一项提案，要求把这项提案交付联合国大会讨论”。
    美国7月18日在安理会上提出的提案，是要求举行联合国大会紧急会议来讨论所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉黎巴嫩内政”的问题。美国现在又重新提出这个毫无根据的、而且已经由联合国黎巴嫩观察团一再证明并不存在的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉黎巴嫩内政”的问题，显然是为了要混淆是非，阻挠和破坏联合国大会紧急会议对美英侵略军立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的讨论。
    在美国政府的指示下，美国驻联合国代表洛奇5日表示美国同意召开联合国大会的意见，同时他还表明，他将在程序问题上玩弄诡计，要求安理会紧急会议“尽早地”优先表决把美国对阿联的诬告案提交联合国大会讨论。
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人6日在记者招待会上表示，召开联合国大会特别会议对于英国政府说来是可以接受的。但是，这个发言人透露，英国并无诚意在联大特别会议上讨论美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。他狡辩说，“英国将不赞成由大会来讨论美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的问题，因为并没有这种侵略”。
    这个发言人还说，英国政府的正式复文“不久”即可发出，英国准备支持美国要在联大特别会议上提出的诬告阿拉伯联合共和国所谓干涉黎巴嫩的提案。
