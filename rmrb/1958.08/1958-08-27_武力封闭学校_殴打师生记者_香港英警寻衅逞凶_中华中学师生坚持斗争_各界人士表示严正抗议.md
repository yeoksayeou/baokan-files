Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 26th: According to Hong Kong reports: After the Hong Kong British authorities, under the pretext that the Hong Kong Chinese Middle School building "is dangerous," unreasonably ordered the closure of the school building, they suddenly dispatched more than ten large police vehicles this morning, filled with about 200 armed police, and in a surprise action, rushed into the Chinese Middle School, forcibly closed the school building, drove out teachers and students, and beat teachers, students, and Chinese news reporters who were present, including a Xinhua News Agency reporter. According to preliminary information, a total of twenty to thirty people were beaten, including five who were injured and bleeding.

At 5:49 AM this morning, about 200 Hong Kong British armed police arrived at the entrance of the Chinese Middle School and immediately deployed a tight defense as if facing a formidable enemy. At 6:00 AM, some police officers, led by Superintendent Morrison, rushed into the school and forced teachers, students, and workers residing in the school to leave the school building within 30 minutes, and threatened them. Huang Zufen, the principal of the Chinese Middle School, and the teachers and students who remained in the school, lodged a reasoned protest on the spot, and once again requested permission to repair the school building, but the British police were unreasonable and put Principal Huang Zufen and two teachers in a small room, preventing them from contacting the students.

At 6:40 AM, the Hong Kong police took forceful action to drive the teachers and students out of the school. When reporters on the scene were taking pictures, they were unreasonably interfered with and beaten by the British police. Superintendent Morrison personally threatened and blocked the Xinhua News Agency reporter from taking pictures. Then, three British police officers worked together to violently beat Zhang Guangliang, a reporter from the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, and threw him out of the school gate. Huang Yonghe, a reporter from the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po, Li Xusheng, a reporter from the New Evening News, and Huang Wenfang, a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency, were all subsequently beaten by the British police with specially trained boxing techniques. Six other reporters were thrown out of the school by the British police. The cameras and flashlights of the Ta Kung Pao and New Evening News photographers were also snatched by the British police, smashed on the ground, and trampled on.

After the British police beat and drove out the reporters, the British armed police immediately used batons and fists and kicks to drive the school's teachers and students out of the school building. According to preliminary information, twenty-two teachers and students were injured, some of whom were bleeding.

At exactly 7:00 AM, the Hong Kong police forcibly sealed the Chinese Middle School building with fire lacquer seals, and all school furniture and the clothing of teachers and students were not allowed to be taken out. This act of violence by the British police against the Chinese people continued until 7:30 AM.

Currently, all the staff and students of the Chinese Middle School are still persisting in the campus and sports field. They are extremely indignant at the Hong Kong police authorities' brutality. They firmly oppose the British authorities' act of destroying the educational cause of the Chinese people. In order to enable the school to open on schedule and prevent students' studies from being interrupted, they will first build temporary buildings in the square on the campus until the Hong Kong authorities change their unreasonable attitude and the issue of repairing the school building is reasonably resolved.

After learning of this news, people from all walks of life in Hong Kong went to the Chinese Middle School to express their condolences to the injured staff and students. This morning, representatives of teachers and students from twenty-two schools and representatives of social organizations, totaling more than 2,000 people, expressed their sympathy and condolences to Principal Huang Zufen. They pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' hostility towards the Chinese people has reached an extremely blatant and rampant level. They expressed their firm support for the Chinese Middle School's just struggle to defend the school.

Hong Kong journalists, upon hearing the news of the British police beating Chinese reporters, expressed their anger and solemnly protested against the Hong Kong British authorities' barbaric destruction of press freedom, smashing of photographic equipment, and violent assault on the personal safety of news reporters.

　　武力封闭学校  殴打师生记者
    香港英警寻衅逞凶
    中华中学师生坚持斗争  各界人士表示严正抗议
    新华社广州26日电　据香港消息：香港英国当局继借口香港中华中学校舍“有危险”无理下令封闭校舍后，突于今天早晨出动十多部大型警车，满载武装警察约二百多人，用突袭行动，冲入中华中学，强行封闭校舍，驱逐教师、学生并殴打教师学生和在场采访的中国新闻记者，其中有新华社记者。据初步了解，共有二、三十人被殴打，其中有五人受伤流血。
    今晨拂晓五时四十九分，香港英国武装警察约二百多人，开到中华中学门口，随即严密布防如临大敌。六时，部分警察由摩里逊警司带领，冲入学校，强令居留在学校的教员、学生和工友在三十分钟内离开校舍，并施加恫吓。中华中学校长黄祖芬和留校教员、学生当场据理交涉，再次提出准许修理校舍的要求，但英国警察蛮不讲理，把黄祖芬校长和两个教师看管在一个小房间内，不准他们和学生接触。
    六时四十分，香港警察采取武力行动，要把教师和学生驱离学校。现场采访的记者在摄影时，也被英国警察无理干涉，并受到殴打。摩里逊警司首先亲自动手威胁和拦阻新华社记者拍照，接着，三个英国警察合力凶殴香港大公报记者张光亮，把他摔出校舍门外。香港文汇报记者黄永和、新晚报记者李栩生和新华社记者黄文放都先后被英国警察用特别训练过的拳法加以殴打，还有六个记者被英警摔出校舍。大公报和新晚报摄影记者的照像机和闪光灯，也被英国警察抢去摔在地下并用脚踏坏。
    在英警殴打和驱逐记者以后，英国武装警察随即动手使用警棍和拳打脚踢把学校的教师和学生逐出校舍。据初步了解，有二十二个教师和学生被打受伤，其中，有的被打得流血。
    七时正，香港警察用火漆封条强行把中华中学的校舍封闭，所有学校家具和教师、学生的衣物都不许拿出。这场英国警察对中国人民的暴行一直继续到七时三十分。
    目前，中华中学的全体员生仍坚持在校园和运动场内。他们对香港警察当局的暴行极为愤慨，他们坚决反对英国当局这种摧残中国人民教育事业的暴行，为了使得学校能够如期开学，学生的学业不被停顿，将先在校园内的广场盖搭临时建筑物，直到香港当局改变无理态度，使修理校舍问题获得合理解决为止。
    香港各界人士在获知这个消息后，即纷纷前往中华中学慰问受伤的员生。今晨，已经有二十二所学校教师和学生的代表以及社团代表两千多人向黄祖芬校长表示同情和慰问。他们指出，香港英国当局对中国人民的敌视到了极其露骨和猖狂的地步。他们表示坚决支援中华中学维护学校的正义斗争。
    香港新闻界人士闻悉英国警察殴打中国记者的消息后，纷纷表示愤怒，对港英当局这种横蛮破坏新闻自由、打毁摄影工具、对新闻记者人身横加伤害的暴行，表示严正的抗议。（附图片）
