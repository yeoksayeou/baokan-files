Dulles's Department's Current Awkward Situation
Commentator for the Soviet Newspaper "Pravda"

　　Not long ago, a memorandum from the U.S. State Department regarding the "policy of non-recognition of the Chinese Communist regime" appeared in American newspapers. This document, distributed to U.S. embassies, was a clumsy attempt by Dulles's department to defend America's bankrupt foreign policy, namely, the policy of supporting traitorous, anti-people regimes, before world opinion. This policy failed in China, stirred up a surging anti-American sentiment in Latin American countries, and suffered a fatal blow in the Middle East with the victory of the Iraqi revolution not long ago.

　　The State Department's memorandum shows that the American ruling class is panicked by the public opinion demanding a final abandonment of the shortsighted and stubborn policy towards People's China.

　　It is not difficult to understand why this document was published precisely now and resurrected stale and ridiculous arguments that were refuted by life a decade ago. In recent weeks, American newspapers have not concealed their concerns that the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations might be raised sharply again at this session of the UN General Assembly. For example, "The New York Times" wrote anxiously that the discussion of this issue might affect the outcome of the discussion on the Middle East issue. The U.S. State Department is attempting to use its memorandum to pressure many countries not to change their position on the People's Republic of China. This is because, if Chiang Kai-shek's political corpse is driven out of the United Nations and the People's Republic of China occupies its legitimate position, then there will be many more opportunities to satisfactorily resolve urgent international problems. But this is precisely what the American ruling class, which is trying to maintain international tension, does not want.

　　The U.S. State Department issued its memorandum in an attempt to weaken the worldwide reaction caused by the historic meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong. The results and impact of this meeting fully demonstrated the growing international prestige of the People's Republic of China, which, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, is the vanguard of humanity's struggle for peace. Dulles's policy of non-recognition of this great nation appears even more absurd because of this meeting, and the important role this great nation plays in deciding international issues is universally known and recognized.

　　The State Department's attempt to incite those who support its bankrupt policy of "non-recognition" of People's China is a foolish act. Contrary to the drafters' wishes, the memorandum amounts to a direct admission of the policy's bankruptcy. Furthermore, this document has achieved the opposite effect of what its drafters hoped for. As the "People's Daily" correctly pointed out, the publication of this memorandum is also a good thing for the Chinese people and the people of other countries, because it "further exposes the aggressive face and ambitions of American imperialism."

　　The American memorandum is a typical example of colonialists' bombastic rhetoric. The American rulers have removed their masks and shamelessly talk about the Far East as if they were talking about their own colonial empire. However, they cannot conceal their bestial fear of the irresistible force of the national liberation movements of all countries.

　　One of the main reasons Washington puts forward to justify its "non-recognition" of the People's Republic of China is the fear that China's neighbors, once the United States retreats, will not be able to resist so-called "Communist aggression." Everyone knows that this term was by no means invented by the State Department, but taken from the arsenal of the instigators of World War II. The American rulers are following in their footsteps and are now using the myth of "Communist aggression" in order to achieve colonial expansion under the pretext of fighting it, acting as the world's policeman to strangle the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

　　Dulles's department, regardless of common sense, has also put forward a series of reasons to justify its policy of "non-recognition" of China. But, we say bluntly, there is nothing to envy about those American diplomats who have to release the arguments they got from Washington.

　　No wonder the "New York Post" wrote angrily, "The State Department denies that its policy is rigid and puts forward some decadent arguments, which can only prove that rigidity is precisely a disease that troubles it."

　　For example, the memorandum says that U.S. recognition of the People's Republic of China would inevitably lead to it occupying a seat in the United Nations. And according to the State Department, "failure to eliminate this would undermine the United Nations as a weapon for maintaining international peace."

　　Could there be anything more absurd and contrary to reason than this? Everyone knows that the United Nations and the Security Council, without the representation of People's China, which represents a quarter of humanity, cannot become respected and effective bodies for maintaining peace and ensuring security. The participation of the People's Republic of China is conducive to the peaceful resolution of acute international problems and the elimination of hotbeds of war. Have not the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the cessation of the war in Indochina clearly proved this to the world? To attempt to ignore the great China is now tantamount to deliberately being an enemy of international cooperation.

　　The drafters of the memorandum desperately resort to international law to justify the policy of non-recognition of People's China. But international law does not and cannot provide any argument to deprive the legitimate seat of one of the founding members of this organization, whose government is the sole expression of the will of 600 million people and has established diplomatic relations with twenty-seven members of the United Nations.

　　The State Department's memorandum nakedly emphasizes that one of the purposes of the U.S. policy of non-recognition of China is to prevent the growth of the People's Republic of China's international prestige. But the growth of the People's Republic of China's international prestige and international influence is independent of the will of Dulles's department. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party, have built international prestige for their country. They have done this through a policy of strengthening peace and international friendship, and through a policy of supporting the just struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa for national independence. The international prestige of People's China has grown because its policy is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries. No force can now stop this growth.

　　There is only one relatively sober idea in the memorandum. This is the recognition that attempts to alienate the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union are futile.

　　The drafters of the memorandum said gloomily, "The alliance between Moscow and Beijing is a solid alliance," which is absolutely true!

　　The friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and the friendship between socialist countries, are as strong as steel. This friendship will continue to be strengthened in the future, enhancing the power and achievements of the socialist camp in international life. Corresponding conclusions should be drawn from this point, but not the kind of conclusions drawn by the U.S. State Department. It believes that the consolidation of the Sino-Soviet alliance is the basis for it to continue to implement the policy of non-recognition of China. However, reason proposes the opposite conclusion. It is necessary to know that the alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and People's China are a guarantee for new achievements in the policy of peaceful coexistence, and a guarantee for the continued improvement of the prestige of the socialist camp, including the People's Republic of China. And that means that Dulles's policy of war-mongering will suffer new defeats.

　　The Chinese working people contemptuously scorn the pathetic new attempts by the American imperialist group to hinder the irresistible forward movement of People's China. China's "People's Daily" wrote: "If the U.S. policy of non-recognition of China has played any role for us, it is only to make our people see more clearly that the American ruling group is the center of all reactionary forces in the world today, and the deadly enemy of all people in the world today who uphold independence and peace. ... As for what role the U.S. policy of non-recognition of China plays in the international arena, it is only to make its own situation more and more isolated. The U.S. stubborn approach of antagonizing China and unreasonably obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations is unpopular not only in Asian and African countries, a point that even the U.S. State Department's memorandum cannot deny, but also increasingly causes dissatisfaction and complaints even among the so-called close partners of the United States in Western countries... The United States' stubborn refusal to recognize China cannot in the slightest degree harm China's ever-increasing international prestige; on the contrary, it can only increasingly expose its ferocious face of refusing peaceful coexistence and inciting international tensions in front of the people of the world."

　　The great Chinese people are confidently sweeping away all obstacles and advancing along the path of building socialism that they have freely chosen. Whether the United States recognizes it or not does not affect the determination of the Chinese working people to carry through to the end the cause they have begun.

　　Free China has many honest and selfless friends. Those who do not recognize it are only a small group of imperialists who are deliberately trying to maintain the system of colonial oppression, but China has the boundless love and recognition of hundreds of millions of working people around the world.

　　The friendship between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people is solid and unbreakable. The alliance of the two great countries, forged by common ideals and common goals, is a factor of paramount importance in international life. Nothing can ever shake our two peoples marching side by side in the great struggle for international peace, for the victory of socialism and communism! (Xinhua News Agency)

　　杜勒斯的衙门当前的尴尬处境
　　苏联“真理报”评论员
    不久以前，在美国报纸上出现了美国国务院关于“不承认中国共产党政权的政策”的备忘录。这个分发给美国各大使馆的文件，是杜勒斯的衙门想在世界舆论的面前为美国破了产的外交方针、也就是为扶持卖身求荣的反人民政权的政策进行辩护的拙劣企图。这个政策过去在中国遭到了破产，并且在拉丁美洲国家引起了反美情绪的蓬勃高涨，不久前随着伊拉克革命的胜利，它在中东遭到了致命的打击。
    国务院的备忘录表明，美国统治集团对要求最后放弃对人民中国的近视和顽固政策的舆论感到惊惶失措。
    为什么恰恰在现在发表这个文件并撤出了在十年前就已经被生活所驳倒的陈腐可笑的论调，这是不难理解的。美国报纸最近几周来，并不隐讳它们担心在联合国大会这次会议上可能会重新尖锐地提出中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题。例如“纽约时报”忧虑地写道，对这个问题的讨论可能会影响到对中东问题的讨论结果。美国国务院企图用自己的备忘录对许多国家施加压力，不许它们改变对中华人民共和国的立场。这是因为，如果一旦蒋介石的政治僵尸被赶出联合国，而中华人民共和国据有它合法的地位，那时就会有多得多的机会来圆满地解决国际间的迫切问题。但这正是极力想保持国际紧张局势的美国统治集团所不希望的。
    美国国务院发出它的备忘录，企图削弱赫晓鲁夫和毛泽东历史性会见在全世界所引起的反响。这个会见的结果及其影响充分显示了中华人民共和国逐年增长的国际威望，它同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起都是人类争取和平的先锋队。不承认这一个大国的杜勒斯政策由于这个会见而显得更为荒谬，这个大国在决定国际问题方面的重要作用是大家全都知道并为大家所公认的。
    国务院企图鼓动拥护它那种已经破产了的“不承认”人民中国的政策的人，这是一种愚蠢的做法，同草拟者的意志相反，备忘录等于直接承认了这个政策的破产。此外，这个文件得到了同它的草拟者所指望的完全相反的效果。正如“人民日报”所正确地指出的，这份备忘录的发表，对于中国人民和其他国家人民来说，倒也是一件好事，因为它“进一步暴露了美国帝国主义的侵略面目和野心”。
    美国的备忘录是殖民主义者典型的夸夸其谈的例证。美国统治者摘下了假面具，厚颜无耻地谈论远东，就好像谈论它自己的殖民主义帝国一样，然而，他们不能够掩盖对各国人民争取民族解放运动不可抗拒的力量的兽性的恐惧。
    华盛顿提出的为“不承认”中华人民共和国辩解的主要理由之一是恐怕中国的邻国一旦在美国退却之后，就不能抵抗所谓的“共产主义侵略”。大家知道，这个术语决不是国务院发明的，而是从第二次世界大战的发动者的武器库里取来的。美国执政者步他们的后尘，现在也利用起“共产主义侵略”的神话，以便在同它作斗争的借口下，实现殖民主义的扩张，充当世界宪兵的角色来扼杀亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族解放运动。
    杜勒斯的衙门不顾一切地违背常识，还提出了一系列的理由来为它“不承认”中国的政策辩解。但是，我们直截了当地说，对那些不得不把从华盛顿拿来的那种论据施放出来的美国外交家们，没有什么可以羡慕的。
    无怪乎“纽约邮报”怒气冲冲地写道，“国务院否认它的政策是生硬的，并提出了一些腐朽的论据，这些论据只能证明：生硬恰恰是使它伤脑筋的一种毛病。”
    例如，备忘录中说，美国承认中华人民共和国不可避免地会使它在联合国中占有席位。而根据国务院的说法，“如果不消除这一点就可能破坏联合国这个维护国际和平的武器”。
    难道还有比这更荒唐更违背理智的东西吗？要知道，每个人都很清楚，联合国和安全理事会，没有代表人类四分之一的人民中国，就不可能成为维护和平和保障安全的受人尊重的有效的机构。中华人民共和国的参加是有助于和平解决国际尖锐问题和消除战争危险的策源地的。难道朝鲜停战协定的签定和印度支那战争的停止还没有向世界清楚地证明这点吗？企图无视伟大的中国，现在就等于是蓄意与国际合作为敌。
    备忘录的起草人拚命地借口国际法来替不承认人民中国的政策辩解。但是国际法没有也不能提供任何论据来剥夺这个组织的创始会员国之一的合法席位，这个国家的政府是六亿人民意志的唯一表达者，它同二十七个联合国会员国建立了外交关系。
    国务院的备忘录赤裸裸地强调说，美国不承认中国的政策的目的之一是为了不让中华人民共和国的国际威望增长。但是中华人民共和国的国际威望的增长和国际影响是不以杜勒斯的衙门的意志为转移的。伟大的中国人民在久经考验的中国共产党的领导下为自己的国家建立了国际威望。他们通过加强和平和国际友谊的政策，通过支持亚非人民争取民族独立的正义斗争的政策来做到这一点。人民中国的国际威望之所以增长，是由于它的政策符合各国人民的根本利益。现在没有任何力量能够阻挡这种增长。
    在备忘录里只有一个比较清醒的思想。这就是承认离间中华人民共和国和苏联的企图是徒劳无益的。
    备忘录的起草人忧郁地说，“莫斯科和北京的联盟是巩固的联盟”，这是千真万确的！
    中华人民共和国和苏联之间的友谊，社会主义各国之间的友谊像钢铁一般的坚固。这种友谊今后仍将不断加强，增强社会主义阵营在国际生活中的威力和成就。应当从这点得出相应的结论，只不过不是美国国务院的那种结论。它认为苏中联盟的巩固是它继续执行不承认中国的政治的根据。但是，理智提出了恰恰相反的结论。要知道，苏联和人民中国的联盟和友谊是和平共处政策取得新成就的保证，是社会主义阵营的威信，其中也包括中华人民共和国的威信继续提高的保证。而这就是说，杜勒斯在战争边缘兜圈子的政策将遭到新的失败。
    中国劳动人民以满不在乎的鄙夷心情蔑视美国帝国主义集团想阻挠人民中国不可遏止的前进运动的可怜的新企图。中国的“人民日报”写道：“如果说美国不承认中国的政策对我们起了什么作用的话，那只是使我国人民更加看清美国统治集团是今天世界上一切反动势力的中心，是今天世界上一切维护独立、和平的人民的死敌。……至于说美国不承认中国的政策在国际上有什么作用的话，那也只是使它自己的处境越来越孤立。美国敌视中国、无理阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位的死硬作法，不仅在亚非国家中不得人心，这点连美国国务院的备忘录也不能否认，即使在西方国家，美国的所谓亲密伙伴中，也日益引起不满和抱怨……美国顽固地拒绝承认中国，对于中国的日益增高的国际威信丝毫不能有所损害，相反的，这却只能在全世界人民面前日益暴露它拒绝和平共处、煽动国际紧张局势的穷凶极恶的面貌。”
    伟大的中国人民正在满怀信心地扫除一切障碍沿着他们自由选择的建设社会主义的道路前进。美国承认或者不承认，这丝毫不影响中国劳动人民把开始的事业胜利地进行到底的决心。
    自由的中国有很多诚实的、无私的朋友。不承认它的只是一小撮处心积虑地企图保持殖民主义压迫制度的帝国主义者，但是中国得到全世界亿万劳动人民的无限热爱和承认。
    苏联和中国人民的友谊是坚固的、是牢不可破的。由共同的思想和一致的目标所结成的两大国的联盟是国际生活中具有头等重要意义的因素。无论什么东西都永远也不能动摇我们两国人民在争取国际和平、争取社会主义和共产主义胜利的伟大斗争中并肩前进！　（新华社）
