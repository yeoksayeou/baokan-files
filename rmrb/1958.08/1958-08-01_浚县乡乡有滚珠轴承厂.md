In Junxian County, Henan Province, the people are vigorously developing the ball bearing manufacturing industry. After twenty days of hard work, they have established twenty-seven ball bearing factories in all eighteen townships and one town in the county, achieving the goal of having a ball bearing factory in every township. By the end of June, these factories had produced 198,320 ball bearings and 5,087 sets of steel sleeves.

The success of establishing ball bearing factories has greatly promoted the agricultural tool reform movement. Currently, more than 12,000 tools in the county have been retrofitted with ball bearings and steel sleeves, including major tools such as carts and handcarts, water lifting tools, and double-wheeled double-share plows. Six townships have basically achieved ball bearing implementation for tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows, waterwheels, and carts.

This report focuses on the Weixian Township Ball Bearing Factory—also known as the Steel Ball Factory.

This factory was established in May of this year by concentrating more than eighty blacksmiths and ten young agricultural cooperative members from the entire township. In the beginning, everyone used their own tools, with no machines or equipment, starting from scratch. They constructed and produced simultaneously. From the official start of production in June to July 17th, they produced a total of 2,100 sets of bearings in thirteen different sizes and specifications. The township's transportation, water lifting, tillage, and threshing tools have all been retrofitted with ball bearings. (Attached pictures)

### 浚县乡乡有滚珠轴承厂

    浚县乡乡有滚珠轴承厂
    河南省浚县人民大办滚珠轴承制造工业。他们经过二十天的苦战，已经在全县十八个乡和一个镇办起了二十七个滚珠轴承厂，做到乡乡有滚珠轴承厂。到6月底，这些厂已经生产出滚珠十九万八千三百二十个，钢套五千零八十七套。
    办滚珠轴承厂的成绩，大大促进了农具改革运动。目前全县用滚珠钢套改装的工具已有一万二千多件；其中改装的主要工具有大车和手推车、提水工具、双轮双铧犁等工具。有六个乡的双轮双铧犁、水车、大车等工具基本实现滚珠轴承化。
    这里报道的是卫贤乡滚珠轴承厂——人们也叫它为钢珠厂。
    这个厂是今年5月里集中全乡八十多名铁匠和十多个青年农业社员成立起来的。开始时，使用的工具都是每人自己带的，没有一台机器，没有一件工具，白手起家。一面建设，一面生产。从6月正式投入生产到7月17日止，已生产大小不同规格十三种共二千一百多套轴承。全乡的运输、提水、耕地、打场等工具已实现滚珠化。（附图片）
