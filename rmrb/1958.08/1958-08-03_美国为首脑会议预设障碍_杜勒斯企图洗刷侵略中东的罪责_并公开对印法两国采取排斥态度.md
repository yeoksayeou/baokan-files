Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles explained the U.S. government's attitude towards holding a Security Council meeting with heads of government in attendance at a press conference on July 31.

Dulles made it clear that if this meeting were to be held, the United States would not propose any constructive plans to ease the tense situation in the Near and Middle East. On the contrary, the United States is only prepared to do two things: first, to try its best to wash away the crime of U.S. armed aggression in the Middle East; and second, to fabricate so-called "indirect aggression" in the Near and Middle East region. Dulles said that he "certainly does not believe that it is possible at such a meeting to deal with the big problems of the Near and Middle East in a decisive way" or to achieve "decisive results" on some issues. He said that in the eyes of the United States, this meeting should "break the fictitious claim about armed aggression by the United States or Britain" and should "take steps so that indirect aggression can be eliminated through the United Nations or some international agency."

Dulles could not answer the question posed by a reporter: how he could prove that this "indirect aggression" exists. But he still said that the United States would insist on discussing the issue of "indirect aggression," and said, "If the Soviet Union does not want to fight, then it almost must agree to subject such acts of indirect aggression to some kind of control by the United Nations." Dulles's sophistry proves that the United States intends to use the trick of a thief crying "stop thief" to conceal its status as an aggressor defendant at the summit conference. At the same time, the United States intends to steal the name of the United Nations to continue interfering in the national independence movements of Arab countries.

Regarding the date of the meeting, Dulles said that the United States considers August 12 as "acceptable," although such a date is still "a bit early." As for the location, whether New York or some place in Europe is better, the United States "does not have a fixed opinion," but the United States is unwilling for the meeting to be held in Moscow.

Dulles stated that the United States is unwilling to invite India to participate in this meeting. He said that India's participation would make the meeting "have to invite many other countries" to participate, thus creating "serious problems" and making the meeting "virtually unmanageable."

A reporter asked Dulles whether the summit would still be held if French Prime Minister de Gaulle refused to attend. Dulles replied that the United States and France have "differences" on the issue of holding a summit. He believes that "as long as other heads of government come," the meeting can be held.

Dulles also spoke about the Lebanon issue. He said he was "very pleased" that the Lebanese election had taken place. But he "couldn't say" whether this matter itself would have an impact on the withdrawal of troops. He said that whether the United States withdraws its troops will "depend on what attitude the new government may take and what the United Nations may do." He said, "There are many things that will affect when U.S. troops withdraw."

Dulles further said: "We may not think it is wise to withdraw, but we would withdraw under those conditions: we would not stay in Lebanon after the legally constituted Lebanese government asked us to withdraw. In general, we believe that when we withdraw, there should be a greater degree of political stability than when we entered, and that would be our hope." Dulles's remarks extremely bluntly exposed the conspiracy the United States is playing with regarding the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon.

Dulles also stated that he hopes that a permanent United Nations force can be established, which can be sent to the Middle East, to Lebanon or Jordan, to replace the U.S. and British occupying forces. He described this practice as an "international condition" for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

Regarding Iraq, Dulles hinted that, given the increasing consolidation of the government of the Republic of Iraq, the U.S. government would have to reconsider its policy towards this new government. He acknowledged that the issue of recognizing the new Iraqi government had been discussed during the meeting of the "Baghdad Pact" organization in London.

    美国为首脑会议预设障碍
    杜勒斯企图洗刷侵略中东的罪责
    并公开对印法两国采取排斥态度
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯7月31日在记者招待会上说明了美国政府关于举行有政府首脑参加的安全理事会会议的态度。
    杜勒斯表明，如果举行这个会议，美国不会在会上提出任何缓和中近东紧张局势的建设性计划。相反，美国只准备作两件事情：第一是竭力洗刷美国武装侵略中东的罪行；第二是捏造在中近东地区有所谓“间接侵略”。杜勒斯说，他“肯定并不认为在这种会议上可能以一种决定性方式来处理中近东地区的大问题”或者对一些问题取得
  “决定性的结果”。他说，在美国心目中，这个会议要“打破关于美国或英国进行武装侵略的虚构说法”，并且应当“采取步骤以便能够通过联合国或者某种国际机构来消除间接侵略”。
    杜勒斯无法回答记者提出的这个问题：他怎样能够证实这种“间接侵略”是存在的。但是他仍然说，美国将坚持要讨论“间接侵略”问题，并说“如果苏联不想打仗，那么它几乎必须同意使这种间接侵略行为受到联合国的某种控制”。杜勒斯这种强词夺理的说法证明了美国正是打算用贼喊捉贼的手法在政府首脑会议上掩饰它的侵略者的被告地位。同时，美国还打算盗用联合国的名义来对阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动继续进行干涉。
    谈到会议的日期问题，杜勒斯说，美国认为8月12日这个日期是
  “可以接受”的，虽然这样一个日期还“嫌早了一些”。至于地点，究竟是纽约还是欧洲某些地方好，美国“倒没有固定的意见”，但是美国不愿意会议在莫斯科举行。
    杜勒斯表示，美国不愿意邀请印度参加这个会议。他说，印度的参加会使得会议“不得不邀请另外许多国家”参加，从而产生“严重的问题”，使会议变得“实际上无法掌握”。
    有记者问杜勒斯，如果法国总理戴高乐拒绝出席最高级会议是否还会举行。杜勒斯回答说，美国和法国对于举行最高级会议的问题是有“分歧”的。他认为“只要有其他政府首脑来了”，会议就可以举行。
    杜勒斯还谈到黎巴嫩问题。他说，他对于黎巴嫩选举已经进行感到“很高兴”。但是这件事本身是不是将对撤军发生影响他“说不上来”。他说，美国是否撤军，将“决定于新政府可能采取什么态度、决定于联合国可能作些什么事情。”他说：“有很多事情将影响美军在什么时候撤退”。
    杜勒斯还进一步说：“我们可能不认为撤出来是明智的，但是在那种条件下我们是会撤出来的：在依法组成的黎巴嫩政府要求我们撤出后，我们就不会待在黎巴嫩。大体上，我们认为，在我们撤出时应当比在我们开进去时有着更大程度的政治稳定，那将是我们的希望。”杜勒斯的这一番话极其露骨地说穿了美国在从黎巴嫩撤退军队问题上玩弄的阴谋。
    杜勒斯还表示，他希望能够成立联合国常设部队，这支部队可以开到中东去，开到黎巴嫩或者约旦，去接替美英占领军。他把这个做法说成是撤退美军的一个“国际条件”。
    谈到伊拉克，杜勒斯暗示，鉴于伊拉克共和国政府的日益巩固，美国政府将不得不重新考虑它对这个新政府的政策。他承认，在伦敦“巴格达条约”组织开会期间曾经讨论过承认伊拉克新政府的问题。
