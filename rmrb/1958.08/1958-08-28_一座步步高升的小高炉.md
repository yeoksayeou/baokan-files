　　A Small Blast Furnace That Steadily Rises
　　Zhu Yingnan
    The six-cubic-meter small blast furnace of the Baishishui Iron Smelting Plant in Pubei County, Guangdong, was built in April of this year. Since it was put into production, the production situation has been very good, and the output has been increasing day by day. As of August 10, the daily output had reached 7.4 tons, and the utilization coefficient had reached 0.81, which is close to the general level of the utilization coefficient of modern large blast furnaces in the country, providing good experience for the production and operation of small blast furnaces.
    The equipment of this factory is not superior to that of similar small factories, and the technical force is not particularly strong. In addition to a technician and five workers who have cast pots, the remaining 40-odd employees are all novices who have not been exposed to iron smelting. However, under such equipment and technical conditions, they have created quite considerable achievements. How did they achieve their achievements? We believe that the following points of experience are worth considering:
    Creatively Apply the Experience of Brother Factories
    During the construction of the factory, the factory sent workers to Yunfu and Zijin Iron Smelting Plants to learn, and absorbed a lot of useful experiences and lessons. For example, when starting the furnace, Yunfu put ore in without putting charcoal in first, and Zijin only put in two batches of charcoal before putting in ore. As a result, the hearths in both places froze due to insufficient temperature, causing major accidents. According to this lesson, Baishishui Iron Plant first put in ten batches of empty charcoal (100 jin per batch) before putting in ore, and the ore was also gradually increased. The first batch was 50 jin (200 jin of charcoal), and then 10 jin was added every three to five batches, gradually reducing the carbon ratio (now the carbon ratio is 1.06). Therefore, freezing accidents were avoided, and iron was smoothly produced from the beginning. In mastering the air volume, they also broke the specifications in the books and made new developments. According to the introduction in the books, only one-half or three-quarters of the full air can be used within four to five days of starting the furnace. This is the experience of large furnaces of hundreds of tons or more. How should small furnaces use air when starting the furnace? The books do not introduce it. According to the characteristics of small furnaces, they used full air one and a half days after starting the furnace, which quickly increased the furnace temperature, and the ore quickly melted, avoiding dead furnace accidents. In the use of hot air, they used their brains to give full play to the potential of the hot air furnace and increased the air temperature. Generally, the hot air pipes in hot air furnaces are supported by small iron drills. Since the temperature of the hot air furnace is very high, the iron drills are often burned soft, causing the hot air pipes to lose support and be damaged. Therefore, the general hot air furnace does not dare to raise the furnace temperature too high, and the highest is only over 400 degrees Celsius. According to this situation, they used fire-resistant mud made of yellow mud mixed with carbon powder to cover the iron drills, and raised the furnace temperature of the hot air furnace to 530 degrees Celsius. As the temperature of the hot air furnace increased, the furnace temperature of the blast furnace also increased accordingly. In the use of the blower, they also boldly broke through the original design capacity according to needs and possibilities.
    Do a Good Job of Preparation and Strictly Abide by Operating Procedures
    The ore of Baishishui Iron Plant has undergone roasting, crushing, and screening processes. After roasting, the ore can not only remove sulfur, remove impurities, and dry moisture, but also has a loose structure and is easy to crush. After the ore is roasted, it is crushed, and after crushing, it is screened to keep the diameter between 5 and 15 mm. Those below 5 mm and above 15 mm are not put into the furnace. The charcoal is also screened, generally kept between 10 and 15 cm. The size of the limestone is the same as that of the ore. After this series of preparations, the raw materials and fuel are put into the furnace. In this way, the air permeability in the furnace is good, and the ore is easy to be heated and reduced.
    According to the general operating principles, combined with the specific requirements of the factory, they formulated 73 operating methods, which specifically stipulate the treatment of furnace front, furnace top, hot air furnace, shutdown, restart, roasting, crushing, safety measures, accidents, etc. For example, when adding materials, they must be added according to the provisions of the gauge and drop scale, and cannot be arbitrarily advanced or postponed. Iron and slag must be discharged in strict accordance with the specified time. The furnace temperature of the hot air furnace must be kept stable, and the maximum should not exceed 530 degrees Celsius, etc. The operating procedures have been discussed and studied by workers, and they consciously abide by them. Therefore, the entire operation can basically meet the requirements, and no confusion or errors occur.
    Close Cooperation Between Workshops and Between Shifts
    The relationship between the power workshop and the blast furnace workshop is the most important. The quality of the power workshop's work is quickly reflected in the production of the blast furnace workshop. Therefore, they pay special attention to the cooperation between these two workshops. The blast furnace workshop notifies the power workshop of the required air volume at any time, and the power workshop adjusts it in time and accurately delivers the required air volume. The power workshop cannot arbitrarily increase or decrease the air volume without receiving the notice from the blast furnace workshop. Since there is only one blower, the power unit needs to be replaced frequently. Therefore, the power workshop has put forward the slogan of non-stop air during machine replacement, and taken measures to prevent the blast furnace workshop from running out of air during machine replacement. The shift handover is also relatively good. The off-duty shift must arrive at the construction site 15 minutes in advance to participate in the pre-shift and post-shift meetings. The on-duty shift introduces the situation and provides suggestions, and the off-duty shift formulates the operating policy based on the situation of the on-duty shift, so that the shifts can be connected to each other. All this embodies the spirit of mutual support and mutual cooperation. Because the cooperation in all aspects is done well, the production can be carried out in an orderly manner, avoiding many errors.
    Constantly Oppose Right-leaning Conservative Thinking
    According to the original design, the small blast furnace of Baishishui Iron Plant has a daily output of 4.5 tons of pig iron. The daily output of this small blast furnace increased to 5 tons on the fifth day after the second furnace start. However, they were not satisfied with this, but continued to improve the operation and constantly increase the output. As a result, the output increased from 5 tons to 6 tons, and then to 7.3 tons, which is 62% higher than the estimated production capacity at the time of design. Now, they are actively working hard to increase the daily output to 8 tons.
    The key to increasing output is to reduce the effective volume utilization coefficient, but this must be carried out based on the possibility of furnace temperature and wind force and under the condition of not affecting the normal operation of the furnace. Otherwise, not only will the output be reduced and the quality deteriorated, but also accidents such as the cooling of the furnace will be difficult to occur. They have mastered such a principle, that is, they do not relax every possibility of increasing output, nor do they blindly engage in it, but carefully observe and study, and rise step by step. Therefore, they have achieved good results.
    The fact that the output of Baishishui Iron Plant is constantly increasing shows that the potential of small blast furnaces is very large. The argument that small blast furnaces are backward and will soon be eliminated is obviously unfounded. The small blast furnace of Baishishui Plant shows us that as long as we base ourselves on scientific principles, constantly summarize the existing production experience, and constantly improve operating technology, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces can also reach the level of modern large blast furnaces, and produce more and better iron for the motherland!

　　一座步步高升的小高炉
　　朱映南
    广东浦北县白石水炼铁厂容积六立方公尺的小高炉是在今年4月间建立起来的。投入生产以来，生产情况一直很好，产量逐日增加。到8月10日止，日产量已达到七点四吨，利用系数达到零点八一，接近全国现代大高炉利用系数的一般水平，为小高炉的生产操作提供了很好的经验。
    这座工厂的设备比同类型的小厂并不优越，技术力量也并不特别强，除一名技术员和五名曾经铸过锅的工人之外，其余四十多名职工都是没有接触过炼铁的新手。但是，就在这样的设备和技术条件下，他们创造了十分可观的成绩。他们的成绩是怎样取得的呢？我们认为下列几点经验是值得参考的：
    创造性地运用兄弟厂的经验
    建厂过程中，厂里就派了工人到云浮、紫金炼铁厂学习，吸取了不少有益的经验教训。例如开炉，云浮没有下空木炭就下矿石，紫金也只下了两批木炭就下矿石，结果，两个地方的炉缸都由于温度不够而冻结，造成重大事故。白石水铁厂根据这一教训，开炉时先下了十批空木炭（每批一百市斤）才下矿石，而矿石也是逐步增加，第一批下五十斤（木炭二百斤），以后每隔三至五批再增加十斤，逐渐降低炭比（现在炭比为一点零六），因此，避免了冻结事故，一开始便顺利地出了铁水。在掌握风量上，也打破了书本上的规格，作了新的发展。按照书本上的介绍，开炉四至五天内只能用全风的二分之一或四分之三。这是几百吨以上的大炉子的经验。小炉子开炉时应该怎样用风，书本上没有介绍。他们根据小炉子的特点，开炉后一天半便用全风，使炉温迅速增高，矿石很快熔解，避免死炉事故。在热风的使用上，他们开动脑筋，发挥了热风炉的潜力，提高了风温。一般热风炉内的热风管都是用小铁钻支垫，由于热风炉温度很高，往往把铁钻烧软，使热风管失去支力而损坏。因此，一般热风炉不敢把炉温提得过高，最高也不过摄氏四百多度，他们根据这一情况，便用黄泥混合炭粉造成的耐火泥敷在铁钻上，把热风炉的炉温提高到五百三十度。由于热风炉温增加，高炉炉温也就相应地得到增加。在鼓风机的使用上，根据需要和可能，也大胆地突破了原来的设计能力。
    做好准备工作严格遵守操作规程
    白石水铁厂的矿石，都经过了焙烧、破碎、筛选等过程。矿石经过焙烧，不但可以去硫、除杂质、干燥水分，而且组织松散，易于破碎。矿石焙烧后即进行破碎，破碎后，都经过筛选，直径保持在五至十五公厘之间。五公厘以下和十五公厘以上的都不入炉。木炭也经过筛选，一般保持在十至十五公分之间。石灰石的大小则与矿石相同。经过这一系列的准备，才使原料、燃料入炉。这样，既能使炉内透气性良好，又能使矿石易于受热还原。
    他们根据一般的操作原则，结合本厂的具体要求，订定了七十三条操作方法，对于炉前、炉顶、热风炉、休风、复风、焙烧、破碎、安全措施、事故的处理等等，都作了具体规定。例如加料，必须按照表尺下降尺度的规定加入，不能任意提前推后。出铁出渣，必须严格遵守规定的时间进行。热风炉炉温必须保持稳定，最高不能超过五百三十度等等。操作规程都经过工人讨论学习，作到自觉遵守。因此，整个操作基本上能够符合要求，不致发生忙乱和差错。
    车间与车间、上班与下班之间密切协作
    动力车间与高炉车间的关系最重要，动力车间工作的好坏，迅速地反映到高炉车间生产的好坏。因此，他们特别注意这两个车间的协作。高炉车间把需要的风量随时通知动力车间，动力车间则及时调整，准确地输送所需要的风量，动力车间不接高炉车间的通知，不能任意增加或减少风量。由于只有一部鼓风机，动力机需要经常调换使用，因此，动力车间便提出换机不停风的口号，采取措施，在换机时使高炉车间不致断风。上下班之间也结合得比较好。下班必须提前十五分钟到达工地参加班前班后会议，由上班介绍情况，提供意见，下班即根据上班的情况定出操作方针，使上下班之间能互相衔接。如此等等，都体现了互相支援、互相协作的精神。由于各方面的协作做得好，因此，使生产能够有秩序地进行，避免了许多差误。
    不断地反对右倾保守思想
    白石水铁厂的小高炉，按原设计是日产生铁四吨半。这座小高炉第二次开炉后的第五天，即提高到日产五吨。但是，他们并没有因此自满，而是继续改进操作，不断提高产量。结果产量又从五吨提高到六吨，进而提高到七点三吨，比设计时预计生产能力提高62％。现在，他们正在积极为提高到日产量八吨而努力。
    提高产量的关键在于降低有效容积利用系数，但这必须根据炉温、风力的可能以及在不影响炉子正常情况的条件下进行，不能随便盲目降低。否则，不但会减少产量，质量变坏，严重时，还会产生炉子冷却难行等事故，他们正是掌握了这样一条原则，既不放松每一个提高产量的可能，又不盲目乱搞，而是细心观察研究，步步上升。因此，得到良好的结果。
    白石水铁厂产量不断提高的事实说明，小高炉的潜力是很大的，那种认为小高炉落后，不久就会被淘汰的论调显然是没有根据的。白石水厂小高炉向我们表明，只要根据科学原理，不断总结已有的生产经验，不断改进操作技术，小高炉的利用系数同样可以达到现代大高炉的水平，为祖国生产出更多更好的铁！
