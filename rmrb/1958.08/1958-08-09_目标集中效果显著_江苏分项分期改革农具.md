Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th: Jiangsu Province is adopting a method of focused, phased bursts to carry out the farm tool reform movement at high speed. This movement revolves around the need for drought resistance and seedling protection, autumn harvesting and planting, and the ten major winter and spring campaigns. Centered on ball bearing implementation, with the reform of harvesting and threshing tools, deep plowing and planting tools, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and transportation tools as the main content, it will be fully completed in the three months of August, September, and October, basically realizing the semi-mechanization of agriculture.

At present, the number of ball bearing factories in the province has increased from more than 50 in late July to 1,156. More than 5 million pieces of large, medium-sized, and improved old farm tools and improved new farm tools have been reformed and promoted throughout the province. One hundred and ninety-two townships have achieved cartization, and twenty-six townships have achieved windmillization. However, due to insufficient understanding of the far-reaching significance of farm tool reform by some leaders and a lack of focused attention, the farm tool reform movement in some areas has not formed a mass movement, and thus the speed has been slow. Party committees at the local, municipal, and county levels have revised their farm tool reform plans in accordance with the instructions of the provincial party committee, and are carrying out concentrated campaigns according to the degree of urgency. The general arrangement is: in August, all farm tools that can be fitted with ball bearings will be fully fitted with ball bearings to achieve ball bearing implementation; the reform and promotion tasks of all harvesting and threshing tools (including sweet potato slicers) will be completed; in September, the reform of deep plowing and water management tools will be completed; and in October, the work will be completed, and all farm tools that should be improved will be improved. This method of phased bursts by category is convenient for concentrating technical forces and strengthening leadership, and therefore the progress is rapid and the effect is significant. After the Kunshan County Party Committee made an emergency mobilization on the night of July 31, it modified and manufactured more than 14,000 farm tools by August 2. Suqian County concentrated more than 3,000 iron and wood workers from the county, carried out a concentrated effort every ten days, and adopted the method of everyone trying out, on-site appraisal, and comprehensive promotion in each concentrated effort, so that a vigorous new situation appeared in the county's farm tool reform movement. In eight days, the county fully fitted all 30,000 waterwheels and transportation vehicles with ball bearings.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 8th: A new high tide of farm tool reform centered on the manufacture of ball bearings is taking shape in various parts of Zhejiang Province. As of August 6, 67 units in 45 of the province's 79 counties and cities had manufactured ball bearings.

    目标集中效果显著
    江苏分项分期改革农具
    新华社南京8日电  江苏省各地采取分项分期突击的办法，高速度开展农具改革运动。这个运动围绕抗旱保苗、秋收秋种和冬春十大运动的需要，以滚珠轴承化为中心，以改革收割脱粒工具、深耕播种工具、水利、积肥、运输工具为主要内容，将在8、9、10三个月份内，全部完成，基本实现农业的半机械化。
    目前全省滚珠轴承厂已由7月下旬的五十多个发展到一千一百五十六个。全省改革和推广的大中型旧农具及改良的新农具已达五百余万件。已有一百九十二个乡实现车子化，二十六个乡实现风车化。但由于部分领导对农具改革的深远意义认识不够，抓得不紧，有些地区的农具改革运动没有形成群众性的运动，因而速度不快。各地、市、县委都根据省委指示修订了农具改革规划，分别缓急开展突击运动。一般的安排是：8月份把一切可以装滚珠轴承的农具全部装上滚珠轴承，实现滚珠化；完成全部收割、脱粒农具（包括甘薯切片机）的改革和推广任务；9月份完成深耕、治水工具的改革，10月份扫尾，把应改良的农具全部改完。这种分项分期突击的办法，便于集中技术力量，便于加强领导，因而进度很快，效果显著。昆山县委在7月31日夜紧急动员后，到8月2日就改制各种农具一万四千多件。宿迁县集中了全县三千多铁木工，每十天一个突击，每次突击中都采取大家试制、现场鉴定、全面推开的办法，使全县农具改革运动出现了轰轰烈烈的新局面。这个县八天就把全县三万多辆水车和运输车全部装上滚珠轴承。
    据新华社杭州8日电  以制造滚珠轴承为中心的农具改革新高潮，正在浙江省各地形成。截至8月6日止，全省七十九个县、市中，已有四十五个县、市的六十七个单位制造出滚珠轴承。
