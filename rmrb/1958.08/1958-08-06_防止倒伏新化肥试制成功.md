A new type of chemical fertilizer – potassium silicate fertilizer – has recently been successfully trial-produced by Yan Qiming, a technical assistant and Communist Youth League member from the Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau of Panyu County, Guangdong Province. This fertilizer can enhance the hardness of rice stalks and the firmness of grain epidermis cells, preventing rice lodging. At the same time, it can strengthen the resistance of rice to rice blast and brown spot disease.

Yan Qiming studied the growth process of rice and found that in addition to absorbing large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, rice also needs to absorb a large amount of silicate fertilizer. This fertilizer can silicify rice stalks and enhance their hardness. At the same time, the silicate remains in the cell walls of the panicles, preventing bacteria from invading through the weak cell pores of the rice and resisting diseases. However, in the past, China did not have this type of chemical fertilizer, and rice could only absorb this fertilizer from water and rice straw decomposition. The water contains little silicate, and the return of rice straw to the field is limited by time and source. With the specific assistance of the county party committee, Yan Qiming finally succeeded after more than forty days and more than one hundred experiments.

This new chemical fertilizer is made by heating low-grade alkaline sand (accounting for 58.333%), white sand (accounting for 38.021%), charcoal powder (accounting for 2.518%), and borax (accounting for 1.128%). The finished product contains approximately 46% silicic acid and 49% potassium. It is advisable to apply 15 to 20 jin per mu of land. It can be applied at any time, and the rice stalks absorb it quickly. The cost is very low, only one jiao and three fen per jin. The Panyu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to manufacture it in large quantities. (According to Wen Hui Bao news)

### 防止倒伏新化肥试制成功

    防止倒伏新化肥试制成功
    广东番禺县农林水利局技术助理员、共青团员颜杞明，最近试制成功一种新的化学肥料——矽酸钾肥。这种肥料能增强稻秆硬度和谷粒表皮细胞坚实，防止水稻倒伏，同时能加强水稻对稻热病、胡麻叶斑病的抵抗力。
    颜杞明研究了水稻生长过程，发现水稻除要大量吸收氮、磷、钾三种肥料外，还要大量吸收矽酸肥。这种肥分可使水稻茎秆矽质化，增强稻秆硬度。同时，矽酸留在禾穗的细胞壁，便使细菌不能从水稻薄弱环节的细胞孔入侵，抗拒病害。但是，过去我国却没有这种化学肥料，水稻只能从水和稻秆还原中吸收这种肥分。水里含的矽质不多，而稻秆回田却受时间、来源限制。颜杞明在县委的具体帮助下，经过四十多天、一百多次的试验，终于获得了成功。
    这种新的化学肥料，是由低级枧沙（占58.333％）白沙（占38．021％）炭粉（占2.518％）硼砂（占1.128％）加热制成的。成品具有矽酸46％，钾49％左右，每亩田施十五至二十斤为宜。可以随时施用，稻秆吸收很快。成本很低，每斤仅值一角三分。中共番禺县委会已经决定大量制造。　（据文汇报消息）
