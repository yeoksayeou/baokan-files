　　Xinhua News Agency, London, August 15th. Having tasted the bitter fruit of the embargo policy, the British government today announced a further relaxation of restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries.

　　The decision to relax the embargo was made in the Paris "Coordinating Committee," which oversees Western trade restrictions with socialist countries, after the governments of the member states of the committee had agreed. Although this decision is overdue and incomplete, it proves once again that the embargo policy initiated by the United States is useless and must eventually be withdrawn. It also reflects the urgent need of Britain and other Western countries for new markets to save their declining industries and alleviate the pressure of the economic crisis. The British "Board of Trade Journal" admitted today that, due to the embargo, trade between Western countries and the socialist bloc last year accounted for less than 3% of their total foreign trade, compared to about 7% in the years before the war.

　　According to British Trade Minister David Eccles, there was originally a list of completely embargoed goods and a list of goods with restricted trade quantities. Now, the list of goods subject to quantity restrictions has been abolished, and the number of embargoed items has been reduced from 181 to 118.

　　This Trade Minister deliberately described this decision as an "important matter." In fact, the list of goods that remain restricted after the revision is still very long, and some new items have been added. These goods that remain embargoed include metal processing machinery, chemical and metallurgical plant equipment, pumps, vacuum tubes, diesel engines, generators, photographic equipment, and gasoline products, etc.

### 饱尝禁运恶果　企图缓和危机　英政府宣布再放宽禁运

　　饱尝禁运恶果　企图缓和危机
　　英政府宣布再放宽禁运
    新华社伦敦15日电　饱尝了禁运政策的恶果以后，英国政府今天宣布进一步放宽对苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家出口的限制。
    放宽禁运的决定，是经过主持西方对社会主义国家贸易限制事宜的巴黎“统筹委员会”各成员国政府同意后，在这个委员会上作出的。虽然这个决定为时过晚并且不彻底，可是它又一次证明美国发起的禁运政策毫无用处，最后不得不予以收回。它还反映了英国和其他西方国家迫切需要新市场来挽救它们衰退的工业，以减轻经济危机的压力。英国“贸易部周报”今天承认，由于禁运，去年西方国家对社会主义阵营的贸易还不到它们全部对外贸易的3％，而在战前几年大约占7％左右。
    据英国贸易大臣戴维·埃克尔斯说，本来有一个完全禁运货物的清单，有一个贸易数量受到限制的货物的清单。现在，受数量限制的货物清单已经取消，而禁运的项目也从一百八十一项减到一百一十八项。
    这个贸易大臣故意把这项决定说成是“重要的事情”。其实，经过修改后仍然受限制的货物清单还是很长，并且还加上了一些新的项目。这些仍然禁运的货物包括金属加工机器、化学和冶金工厂设备、抽水机、真空管、柴油机、发电机、照相器材和汽油产品等等。
