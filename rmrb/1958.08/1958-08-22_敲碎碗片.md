　　Smashing Pottery Shards
    Under the moonlight, a clanging sound filled the air. I walked quickly through several streets and alleys, and saw that every household was smashing pottery shards.
    I asked an old man, "What are you doing this for?" The old man replied, "Making firebricks!"
    Having said that, he pointed to the red-letter slogan under the moonlight, reciting it word by word: "The whole Party and the whole people mobilize to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry!" The old man continued, "Our Taizhou City plans to build three hundred blast furnaces, and they must all produce iron within twenty days! To build blast furnaces, we need firebricks. Now each of our families is planning to contribute six jin of fine powder made from smashed pottery shards. I alone have smashed twenty jin in the first four days, and my grandson and I are striving to contribute sixty jin!" The old man paused for a moment, then turned to ask, "Little Niu, can you guarantee it?"
    Little Niu, who was sifting powder nearby, shouted loudly, "Grandpa, I can guarantee it!"

　　敲碎碗片
    月光下，一片叮当之声。我一口气穿过了几条大街和小巷，看到家家都在敲碎碗片。
    我问一位老大爷：“你敲这干吗？”老大爷回答说：“做耐火砖呀！”
    说罢用手指指月光下的红字标语，一字一字地念着：“全党全民动手大办钢铁工业！”老大爷接着说：“我们太州市计划要造三百个高炉，二十天内就要全部出铁呢！造高炉就要耐火砖，现在我们每家计划要交六斤碎碗片敲成的细粉，可单是前四天里我就敲了二十斤，我和我的小孙子要争取交六十斤呢！”老大爷停了一会，转过脸来问：“小牛，你能保证吗？”
    在旁边筛粉的小牛，大声喊着说：“爷爷，能保证！”
