Chengdu's middle schools universally improve teaching quality

(Our Dispatch) In the process of implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, the forty-six regular middle schools in Chengdu have vigorously established factories, workshops, and farms.

Starting from reality, the schools have carried out a variety of labor activities. Schools have linked up with production units outside the school and established factories. Schools have also established workshops, farms, breeding farms, fish ponds, etc. Some schools have established a fixed system of productive labor with nearby agricultural cooperatives. Combining with the specific situation of Chengdu, schools have universally established embroidery, bamboo ware, weaving, handicraft and other handicraft groups.

Through production activities, the quality of teaching has been greatly improved. More than 13,000 students in the city have initially mastered one or two production technologies, including more than 1,600 who have mastered one of the technologies of forging, drilling, planing, welding, and casting. At the same time, because the production activities of the schools are closely integrated with social production, students have directly established contacts with the workers and peasants, cultivated students' love for the working people and their concern for industrial and agricultural production, and learned many knowledge that cannot be learned from books. The farm, breeding farm, handicraft society, metalworking, woodworking, and other 28 major labor production bases established by the 20th Middle School are not only places for teachers and students to labor and train, but also enable the production bases to directly serve teaching. Because physics teachers move physics lessons to the metalworking workshop, and biology teachers move biology lessons to the farm, the quality of teaching has been universally improved. Students can clearly answer the content of each lesson, and after testing, more than 90% of the students have excellent grades.

In order to further implement the policy of combining teaching with productive labor, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to incorporate all of the students' one-day-a-week labor into the plan and further implement large-scale collaboration, with each factory contracting to establish production labor workshops for each middle school.

　　成都各中学教学质量普遍提高
    本报讯　成都市四十六所普通中学贯彻教育与劳动生产相结合方针中，大办工厂、车间和农场。
    各校从实际出发，开展了多种多样的劳动活动。学校已和校外生产单位挂了钩，建立了工厂。各校还在校内建立了车间、农场、饲养场、鱼池等。有许多学校同附近农业社建了固定的生产劳动制度。各校还结合成都市的具体情况，普遍建立挑花刺绣、竹器、编织、工艺等手工小组。
    通过生产活动，大大提高了教学的质量。全市已有一万三千多学生初步掌握了一门或两门生产技术，其中有一千六百多名掌握了锻、钻、钳、焊、铸等工种中的一种技术。同时由于各校的生产活动和社会生产密切结合，使学生直接与工农群众建立了联系，培养了学生热爱劳动人民和关心工农业生产的思想感情，学到了许多书本上学不到的知识。第二十中学建立的农场、饲养场、工艺社、金工、木工等二十八个主要的劳动生产基地，不仅是师生劳动锻炼的场所，而且使生产基地直接为教学服务，由于物理教师把物理课搬到金工车间上课，生物教师把生物课搬到农场上课，因之教学质量普遍提高。所讲各课内容，学生都能清楚回答，经过测验，90％以上的学生都是优良成绩。
    为进一步贯彻教学与劳动生产相结合的方针，中共成都市委决定将学生每周一天的劳动力全部纳入计划，进一步实行大协作，分别由各工厂包干为各中学建立生产劳动车间。
