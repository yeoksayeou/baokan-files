Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th: Sichuan Province currently has more than 300 newly built small copper plants put into production, and more than 600 are under construction.

The main reason for the significant progress in the copper smelting industry in Sichuan Province is the participation of the entire Party and all the people. Now, leaders at all levels from the province to the county regard increasing copper production as their important task, and universally mobilize the masses to find mines, report mines, and set up copper plants. In order to guarantee the production of 2,000 tons of copper this year, the Xichang Special District has already sent 100,000 people to the mountains to mine copper ore. Recently, the Zhongjiang County of Suining Special District organized a survey team to travel all over the county, relying on the local masses to discover clues, and traced a large amount of copper resources in fourteen townships.

In accelerating the development of the copper smelting industry, Sichuan Province has adopted the method of fully relying on folk technical forces and simple and crude methods to arrange production economically and rationally. Some mine and smelt separately; others mine separately and smelt centrally. The 154 small copper smelting plants put into production in Fengjie County did not require any investment from the state. The copper smelting furnaces were all built with local mud and stone, and the technicians all came from the people.

This newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th: Indigenous copper furnaces are blooming everywhere in Zhejiang. In the past half month, the province has had 54 small indigenous copper furnaces, producing more than 3,100 catties of blister copper, copper matte, and electrolytic copper.

Recently, Zhejiang Province held an on-site meeting in Shaoxing to exchange and promote the experience of indigenous copper smelting, and planned to produce 5,000 tons of copper this year. In order to complete this plan, all localities are required to have their secretaries take the lead, and workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants work together to vigorously develop indigenous copper smelting.

At the copper smelting conference in Zhejiang Province, through on-site visits and experience exchange, various indigenous copper smelting methods emerged. The roasting furnace used by the Chengguan Copper Smelting Plant in Linhai County and the Tongtian furnace used by the Shaoxing Metal Smelting Plant in Shaoxing County can both increase the copper content of low-grade ore, and then smelt blister copper.

"Simultaneous exploration, production, and construction" was also identified as an extremely important method for developing copper smelting at this on-site meeting.

The meeting also put forward several measures: Party committees at all levels should vigorously grasp copper smelting while grasping steel, launch a mass movement to find copper mines, and establish mining points in every county. Cities such as Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing and the surrounding counties should establish cooperative relations in terms of technical strength and mineral resources. Mobilize the entire Party and all the people to engage in indigenous furnace copper smelting, and areas with mineral resources should build furnaces in every township and let copper water flow from every furnace, and organize the technical forces of the entire province to contribute to the production of 5,000 tons of copper within the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 29th: Twelve counties in Guizhou Province, including Weining, Bijie, Chishui, Yanhe, Panxian, and Leishan, have built 63 copper plants, built more than 800 indigenous copper smelting furnaces, and have smelted 44.5 tons of blister copper, copper matte, and ferro-copper. The copper smelting plant in Heishitou District, Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, has also smelted more than 400 catties of refined copper.

Guizhou Province did not have a copper smelting industry in the past. The ability of the twelve counties including Weining to quickly achieve success in indigenous copper smelting is due to the fact that the county committees in each county earnestly grasped the copper smelting industry while grasping the steel industry, and implemented the policy of the entire people running the copper smelting industry. Weining County organized more than 4,500 cadres and workers in a short period of time, overcame numerous difficulties, and built 44 copper plants and 148 indigenous copper smelting furnaces.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 29th: Most of the 18 indigenous copper smelting furnaces recently built in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are operating normally, and have produced more than 22,000 catties of high-quality blister copper. After Zelimu League, Zhaowuda League, and Hulunbuir League initially summarized the experience of indigenous copper smelting, they jointly held an on-site copper smelting conference, and decided to continue to build hundreds of copper smelting furnaces, striving to produce 16 million catties of copper before the end of the year.

When establishing the copper smelting industry, all parts of Inner Mongolia have gone through typical trials, organized on-site visits, publicized to the masses the important significance of carrying out indigenous copper smelting for national construction, broke the superstitions and concerns about fearing the complexity of copper smelting technology and fearing failure, and vigorously mobilized farmers and cadres of all ethnic groups to participate in mine finding, mine reporting, mining, and smelting activities. In less than two months, ten banners and counties, including Naiman Banner, Kalaqin Banner, and Butha Banner, collected hundreds of thousands of catties of copper ore. All localities have also adopted the method of "simultaneous exploration, production, and construction" to make mining and smelting advance side by side, and quickly smelted copper water.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th: The Jiangning Copper Mine, a local state-owned enterprise in Jiangsu Province, started with indigenous methods and gradually improved, exploring and building at the same time. Since copper was produced with indigenous furnaces at the end of April, they have successively built and expanded three mining areas in Yuanshan, Zhumen, and Tongjing. The number of indigenous furnaces has increased from one to forty-six, and three have been put into production, producing nearly 400 kilograms of blister copper per day. This year's production task has leaped from the original plan of 270 tons to more than 900 tons.

They encountered difficulties such as the freezing of the furnace mouth, the cracking of the furnace body, low furnace temperature, and short lifespan when using indigenous smelting methods. After improving a series of measures such as batching and exchanging and summarizing advanced operating methods, the situation has greatly improved. For example, the Yuanshan mining area, under the operation of several young workers, also created a new record of continuous copper production for 103 hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th: Yihuang County, Jiangxi Province, successfully smelted blister copper using indigenous methods. The blister copper smelted has been identified as having a copper content of more than 80%, and the quality meets the requirements. So far, one furnace has smelted more than 1,000 catties of blister copper. The other two furnaces will also be put into production.

Yihuang County uses sulfide ore to smelt copper. The copper content of this sulfide ore is only about 10%. General mechanized production requires processes such as mineral processing, sintering desulfurization, blowing, and oxidation, while Yihuang County uses indigenous smelting methods, only going through mineral processing, sintering desulfurization, and smelting with a blast furnace (indigenous blast furnace) to obtain blister copper.

The Jiangxi Provincial Metallurgical Bureau held an on-site conference on indigenous copper smelting in this county, believing that this method has three major advantages: low investment, simple equipment, and easy operation, and decided to promote it throughout the province. (Attached pictures)

    边勘探　边生产　边建设
    据新华社成都29日电　四川省目前有三百多座新建的小型铜厂投入生产，还有六百多座正在建设。
    全党全民动手，是四川省炼铜工业取得重大进展的主要原因。现在从省到县的各级领导都把增加铜产量列为自己的重要课题，普遍发动群众找矿、报矿和办铜厂。西昌专区为了保证今年产铜两千吨，已经有十万人上山采掘铜矿石。遂宁专区中江县最近组织勘查队走遍全县，依靠当地群众发现线索，在十四个乡跟踪追寻到了大量铜矿资源。
    在加速发展炼铜工业中，四川省采取了充分依靠民间技术力量和因陋就简的土办法，经济合理地安排生产。有的分散采矿，分散冶炼；有的分散采矿，集中冶炼。奉节县投入生产的一百五十四个小型炼铜厂，没有要国家分文投资，炼铜炉都是用当地的泥石筑成的，技术人员也全部来自民间。
    本报杭州26日电　浙江土铜炉遍地开花，半月来，全省有五十四个炼铜小土炉，生产三千一百多斤粗铜、冰铜和电解铜。
    最近浙江省在绍兴召开现场会议，交流和推广土法炼铜的经验，计划今年产铜五千吨。为了完成这个计划，要求各地书记挂帅，工、农、兵、学、商一起动手，大搞土法炼铜。
    在浙江省的炼铜会议上，通过实地参观和经验交流，出现了各种各样的炼铜土方法。临海县城关炼铜厂采用的焙烧炉，绍兴县绍兴金属冶炼厂采用的通天炉，都能把含铜量比较低的矿石提高含铜量，然后炼出粗铜来。
    “边勘探、边生产、边建设”，也是在这次现场会议上被确定为发展炼铜极其重要的办法。
    会上并提出了几项措施：各级党委在抓钢铁的同时也要大力抓炼铜，发起一个群众性的找铜矿运动，县县建立采矿点。宁波、杭州、嘉兴等市和周围的县在技术力量上、矿源上都建立协作关系。发动全党全民搞土炉炼铜，有矿源的地区做到乡乡建炉、炉炉流铜水，组织全省技术力量为年内生产五千吨铜出力。
    据新华社贵阳29日电　贵州省威宁、毕节、赤水、沿河、盘县、雷山等十二个县已经建成六十三个铜厂，修建起八百多座土炼铜炉，并已炼出粗铜、冰铜和铁铜四十四点五吨。威宁彝族回族苗族自治县黑石头区的炼铜厂，还炼出精铜四百多斤。
    贵州省过去没有炼铜工业，威宁等十二个县用土法炼铜能够迅速获得成就，是由于各县县委在抓钢铁工业的同时，都认真抓炼铜工业，贯彻全民办炼铜工业的方针。威宁县短时期内就组织起四千五百多名干部和工人，克服重重困难，建成四十四个铜厂、一百四十八个土炼铜炉。
    新华社呼和浩特29日电　内蒙古自治区最近建成的十八座土炼铜炉，大部分生产正常，已生产出质量较好的粗铜两万两千多斤。哲里木盟、昭乌达盟、呼伦贝尔盟初步总结土法炼铜的经验以后，联合举行了炼铜现场会议，决定继续兴建几百座炼铜炉，争取在年底以前生产铜一千六百万斤。
    内蒙古各地在建立炼铜工业时，都经过典型试办，组织现场参观，向群众宣传开展土法炼铜对于国家建设的重要意义，打破了怕炼铜技术复杂、怕失败等迷信和顾虑，大力发动各族农民和干部参加找矿、报矿、采矿和冶炼活动。奈曼旗、喀喇沁旗、布特哈旗等十个旗、县，在不到两个月时间里，就采集了几十万斤铜矿石。各地还采取“边勘探、边生产，边建设”的办法，使采矿、冶炼齐头并进，很快就炼出了铜水。
    据新华社南京29日电　江苏省地方国营江宁铜矿用土法上马，逐步提高的办法，一边勘探，一边建设。自4月底用土炉出铜以来，他们已先后在元山、朱门、铜井等地兴建和扩建了三处矿场，土炉子从一个增加到四十六个，已投入生产的三个，日产粗铜近四百公斤。今年的生产任务从原计划的二百七十吨跃进到九百多吨。
    他们用土法冶炼，曾碰到炉口冻结，炉身烧裂，炉温低，寿命短等困难。经过改进配料等一系列措施和交流总结先进的操作法，情况大有改进。如元山矿场在几个青年工人操作下，还创造了连续出铜一百零三小时的新纪录。
    新华社南昌29日电　江西省宜黄县用土法炼粗铜成功，炼出的粗铜经过鉴定，含铜量在80％以上，质量符合要求。到目前，有一个炉子已经炼出粗铜一千多斤。另外两个炉子也将投入生产。
    宜黄县是用硫化矿炼铜的，这种硫化矿含铜量只有10％左右，一般机械化生产需要经过选矿、烧结除硫、吹炼、氧化等过程，而宜黄县采用土法冶炼，只经过选矿、烧结除硫、用鼓风炉（土高炉）冶炼，便可得出粗铜。
    江西省冶金局在这个县召开土法炼铜现场会议，认为这种办法有三大好处：投资少、设备简单、操作容易，决定在全省推广。（附图片）
