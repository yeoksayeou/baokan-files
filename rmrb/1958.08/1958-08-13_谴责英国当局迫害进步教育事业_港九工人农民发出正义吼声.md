Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 12th: Hong Kong workers and farmers are angrily condemning the Hong Kong British authorities for unreasonably forcing Du Boqu, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, to leave Hong Kong and for persecuting the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions held a special meeting of its executive council last night to discuss the recent events. Many trade union representatives at the meeting criticized the Hong Kong authorities for condoning the activities of schools run by American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents to carry out various anti-China activities, while persecuting the educational cause of the Chinese people. The council meeting stated that Hong Kong and Kowloon workers resolutely support Pui Kiu Middle School in adhering to the direction of patriotic education, and expressed their determination to safeguard the rights and interests of Hong Kong compatriots in running patriotic education.

On the evening of August 11th, more than 100 representatives from 44 trade unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon, representing the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, went to Pui Kiu Middle School to express their condolences. Many trade union representatives read out letters of sympathy signed by the workers at the consolation meeting. Taikoo Dockyard Chinese Employees Union, Hong Kong and Kowloon Motor Vehicle Trade Union Federation, Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Trade Union Federation, and Hong Kong Foreign Affairs Workers Union and more than a dozen other trade unions have held meetings in recent days to protest to the British authorities and express their firm support for Pui Kiu Middle School. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association also held a representative meeting on the evening of the 10th. More than 90 representatives from more than 40 member trade unions attending the meeting angrily pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities are attempting to use various means of persecution to prevent Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong from loving their motherland. This political conspiracy is futile.

Farmers in the suburbs of Hong Kong and Kowloon also held meetings to support the anti-persecution struggle of educators. At a meeting held by the Hong Kong General Planting Association on August 9th, more than 60 farmer representatives from various districts attending the meeting angrily pointed out that the Hong Kong British Education Department has always been hostile to the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people. For example, it had interfered in the hanging of the Chinese national flag in nine schools, and had forcibly "convicted" the staff of the Castle Peak Farmers' Literacy Class on the pretext of violating the "Education Ordinance." These all show that the Hong Kong British Education Authorities are carrying out ulterior activities under the guise of "politics." Farmers' representatives from Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan districts also expressed their firm support for Pui Kiu Middle School and the anti-persecution struggle of educators.

On the 11th, more than 150 teacher representatives from more than 30 middle and primary schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon went to Pui Kiu Middle School to express their condolences to all the faculty and staff of the school. Teachers from many schools also wrote letters of sympathy. (Attached picture)

On the evening of August 7th, alumni and Hong Kong and Macao students from Pui Kiu Middle School at Guangzhou Zhongshan University, Zhongshan Medical College, College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Guangdong Normal College, expressed their condolences to Du Boqu (second from left in the front row), who was persecuted by the Hong Kong British authorities, at the Overseas Chinese Building.

　　谴责英国当局迫害进步教育事业
　　港九工人农民发出正义吼声
    新华社香港12日电　香港工人、农民愤怒谴责香港英国当局无理强迫培侨中学校长杜伯奎离开香港和对中国人民爱国教育事业进行的迫害。
    港九工会联合会昨晚特别举行全体理事会议讨论最近发生的事件。许多工会代表在会上对香港当局纵容美蒋特务分子所开办的学校进行各种敌视中国的活动，对中国人民的教育事业却进行迫害，纷纷提出了指责。理事会议表示港九工人坚决支持培侨中学坚持爱国教育的方向，并且表示要维护香港同胞举办爱国教育事业的权益。
    11日晚，香港、九龙有四十四个工会派出代表一百多人代表港九工人前往培侨中学进行慰问。许多工会代表在慰问会上宣读了由工人们签名的慰问信。香港太古船坞华员职工会、港九摩托车业职工总会、港九纺织染业职工总会和香港洋务工会等十多个工会，连日都分别举行集会，向英国当局表示抗议，并且表示坚决支持培侨中学。港九劳工教育促进会10日晚上也举行了代表会议，出席这个会议的四十多个会员工会的九十多个代表愤怒地指出：香港英国当局企图用各种迫害手段来使香港的中国同胞不敢爱祖国，这种政治阴谋是徒劳的。
    香港、九龙郊区的农民也集会声援教育工作者的反迫害斗争。在香港种植总公会9日举行的会议上，出席会议的各区农民代表六十多人愤怒地指出，香港英国教育司向来敌视中国人民爱国教育事业，例如曾干涉九所学校悬挂中国国旗、曾借口违反“教育条例”强行把青山农民识字班的工作人员“判罪”，这些都表明了香港英国教育当局以“政治”为幌子进行着不可告人的活动。九龙城和荃湾区的农民代表也表示坚决支持培侨中学和教育工作者的反迫害斗争。
    11日，港九又有三十多所中、小学校的教师代表一百五十人前往培侨中学向全校教职员工进行慰问，许多学校的教师还写了慰问信。（附图片）
