Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Bonn: Some West German newspapers have recently criticized the United States for provoking tension in the Taiwan Strait.

The influential Hamburg newspaper "Die Welt" complained on the 27th about the consistently hostile policy adopted by the United States towards China. It warned that if the Americans "intervene in the Taiwan Strait and turn the decade-long (Chinese) civil war into an international issue, no one except a few paid puppets, such tragic figures, will consider them to be justified."

The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," published in Munich, accused U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on the 25th of "disregarding all reason and the laws of political expediency," and compared the U.S. provocations in the Taiwan Strait with its actions in the Near East not long ago, believing that there were "many situations" that were "similar." It said: "In the Near East, the United States once attempted to support those corrupt systems that have been crushed by the wheels of historical development; in the Far East, the United States is also standing on the side of a bankrupt politician who has no mass support. It seems as if Dulles is consciously trying to bring a second failure to the United States. In the Near East, he bet on those elements who had long been spurned by their own people; and in China, he is betting everything on Chiang Kai-shek's future luck. No one knows what the future will bring. However, this much can be predicted without any consideration: one day the United States will be completely isolated in East Asia, just as it is in the Near East..."

The West German Social Democratic Party's press release on the 26th stated that the current situation in the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the "serious crisis of the U.S. Far East policy."

　　在蒋介石头上押宝  结果必然输得精光
    西德报纸抨击美国远东政策
    新华社30日讯　波恩消息：一些西德报纸近来抨击美国在台湾海峡挑衅以制造紧张局势。
    有影响的汉堡“世界报”27日埋怨美国一贯采取敌视中国的政策。它警告说，如果美国人在台湾海峡“进行干预而把十年之久的（中国）内战变为国际问题，除了少数受豢养的傀儡这样的悲剧人物以外，没有人会认为他们是正当的”。
    在慕尼黑出版的“法兰克每日邮报”25日指责美国国务卿杜勒斯“不顾一切理性和政治目的性规律”，并且把美国在台湾海峡的挑衅同不久以前它在近东的作法作了比较，认为其中有“不少情况”是“相同”的。它说：“在近东，美国曾经企图支持那些被历史发展的车轮辗走了的腐朽制度；在远东，美国也是站在一个没有群众的破产政治家的利益一边。这样就好像杜勒斯是有意识地要给美国带来第二次的失败。在近东，他把赌注押在那些早已被本国人民唾弃的分子的头上；而在中国，他又把一切都押在蒋介石的将来的运气上。谁也不知道将来会带来些什么。但是，这一点是一点也不需要经过考虑就可以预言的：有一天美国将和它在近东一样，在东亚地区完全处于孤立地位……”。
    西德社会民主党26日的新闻公报认为，目前台湾海峡的局势表明了“美国远东政策的严重危机”。
