Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 28th: The workers of the Anshan Steel Rolling Machinery Plant, which produces a large number of small and medium-sized steel rolling equipment, have highly developed their spirit of revolutionary hard work and decided to accelerate the manufacturing speed of steel rolling equipment. They aim to increase the production of four more sets of medium-sized steel rolling equipment before the end of this year to meet the needs of national development of local steel rolling industries.

This year, the Anshan Steel Rolling Machinery Plant is undertaking the task of producing complete sets of small and medium-sized steel rolling equipment for many provinces and cities. Including the recently increased production of four rolling mill units, this factory will produce a total of twelve sets of steel rolling equipment for more than ten provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Hubei, Hunan, Liaoning, Hebei, Guangxi, and Guangzhou. Six sets have rolling roll diameters of 250 mm to 400 mm. One such rolling mill unit can produce 50,000 tons of steel per year. The other six sets have rolling roll diameters of 300 to 500 mm, and such rolling mill units can produce 100,000 tons of steel per year. Each set of these two types of rolling mills can equip a small or medium-sized steel rolling plant.

The Anshan Steel Rolling Machinery Plant was originally a factory manufacturing ordinary industrial and mining equipment, mainly providing machinery and equipment inspection services for Anshan Iron and Steel. In the Great Leap Forward of this year, the workers of this factory developed a fearless spirit of daring to think and daring to do. Without engineers, large-scale equipment, and manufacturing experience, they bravely undertook the task of manufacturing complete sets of steel rolling equipment. They initially planned to produce one set, and then mass-produce them next year after gaining experience. However, under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, all the workers of the factory worked hard day and night, overcame various difficulties, and successfully trial-produced the first set of rolling mill units not long ago in just twenty-seven days. After the first set of steel rolling equipment was made, the workers' confidence greatly increased. In order to support the development of steel rolling industries across the country, they decided to produce eight sets of steel rolling equipment this year. Recently, in order to ensure that the steel produced in various places can be quickly turned into steel products, they decided to raise the original Great Leap Forward plan target once again.

In order to achieve this new Great Leap Forward target, all the workers of the factory recently re-arranged the production plan for the next four months, putting the manufacture of steel rolling equipment in a primary position, and adopting various new measures to overcome difficulties. One of the difficulties they encountered in implementing the new Great Leap Forward plan was the shortage of steel. In order to overcome this difficulty, in addition to the existing converters and electric furnaces greatly increasing the production of steel ingots and saving a large amount of steel during the manufacturing process, it was also decided to prioritize the supply of existing steel to steel rolling equipment. As a result, the originally planned production of large vehicle steel plates and iron shovels had to be appropriately reduced, and many profits had to be reduced, but this could guarantee the realization of the increased production plan for rolling mills.

### 鞍山轧钢机械厂提出新跃进指标  轧钢设备快快赶上去

　　鞍山轧钢机械厂提出新跃进指标
    轧钢设备快快赶上去
    新华社鞍山28日电　大量生产中小型轧钢设备的鞍山轧钢机械厂职工，高度发扬革命苦干精神，决定加快轧钢设备制造速度，在今年年底前再增产四套中型轧钢设备，满足全国发展地方轧钢工业的需要。
    鞍山轧钢机械厂今年担负着为许多省市生产全套中小型轧钢设备的任务。包括最近增产的四套轧钢机组在内，这个厂今年总共将为湖北、湖南、辽宁、河北、广西、广州等十多个省、市和自治区生产十二套轧钢设备，其中有六套是轧辊直径二百五十公厘到四百公厘的，一套这样的轧钢机组年产钢材五万吨；另六套的轧辊直径是三百到五百公厘的，这样的轧钢机组一套可以年产钢材十万吨。这两种轧钢机每套设备都可以装备一个小型或中型的轧钢厂。
    鞍山轧钢机械厂原来是一个制造普通工矿设备的工厂，主要是为鞍钢的机器设备检验服务。在今年生产大跃进中，这个厂的职工发扬了敢想、敢做的大无畏精神，在没有工程师、大型设备和制造经验的情况下，勇敢地担负了制造全套轧钢设备的任务。他们最初计划生产一套，等有了经验后，明年再大量制造。但在中共鞍山市委的领导下，全厂职工昼夜苦干，克服了种种困难，仅用二十七天的时间，就在不久前试制成功第一套轧钢机组。第一套轧钢设备制成后，职工们信心大增，为了支援全国各地发展轧钢工业，决定今年生产八套轧钢设备。最近，他们为了保证各地炼的钢能迅速变成钢材，又决定再一次提高原来的跃进计划指标。
    全厂职工为了实现这个新的跃进指标，最近重新安排了今后四个月的生产计划，把制造轧钢设备放到了首要的地位，并采取各种新的措施克服困难。他们在实现新的跃进计划时遇到的一个困难，是钢材不足。为了克服这个困难，除了现有的转炉和电炉大量增产钢锭和制造过程中大量节约钢材以外，还决定把现有的钢材优先供给轧钢设备，这样原计划生产的大车钢板和铁锹要适当减低，并且要减少很多利润，但是可以保证实现轧钢机的增产计划。
