Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 27th: Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Cambodian National Delegation he led, returned to Phnom Penh this afternoon on two Chinese airplanes. More than 20,000 people held a welcoming rally at the airport to celebrate Prince Sihanouk's successful and friendly visit to China.

Prince Sihanouk delivered a moving and lengthy speech to the welcoming crowd at the airport.

Prince Sihanouk said that the Chinese government absolutely respects and supports Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality, and considers Cambodia to be a model for implementing this policy.

He said that the Chinese government has announced to the world that Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality not only defends the country's independence, but also benefits peace in Asia and the world. All countries should respect this policy. Premier Zhou Enlai hopes that those neighboring countries that have violated Cambodia will abide by the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, coexist peacefully with Cambodia, and not be directed by others or follow the colonialists.

Sihanouk said that China absolutely does not interfere in Cambodia. Chinese nationals must respect the laws and customs of their country of residence and also help their country of residence to progress.

Sihanouk said that Chairman Mao Zedong told him that history has proven that there is no need to have any fear of China. The Chinese people have tasted the pain of foreign oppression, and China's territory is very large and not afraid of a shortage of land, so China does not want to invade any country.

Sihanouk said, I also announce that, in order to more effectively solve international problems, especially the problems of world peace and the elimination of the Cold War, the Cambodian government supports China, with its 600 million people, in its seat in international conferences and the United Nations.

Sihanouk specifically mentioned China's assistance to Cambodia. He said that the Chinese government has given us new, unconditional, and free assistance. Trade between the two countries will also be expanded more than before and maintained in balance.

He said, "China hopes that Cambodia can actively promote its own industry and agriculture and establish its own national independent economy, without needing to accept foreign aid, not even Chinese aid. I replied to them: 'Your words are very correct, you sincerely love Cambodia.'"

He also said, "China is not selfishly seeking its own prosperity. China wants to use its achievements and experience to help other friendly countries. If Cambodia is determined to be friends with China, it must support China's strength. If China is weak, how can it help Cambodia?"

Prime Minister Sihanouk thanked the Chinese people and government for their very grand and ceremonious reception. He said, "In China, Premier Zhou Enlai, Marshal Chen Yi, and Marshal He Long personally accompanied me to visit various places. Chairman Mao Zedong held three long talks with me; after the talks, he personally escorted me to the car."

Sihanouk also spoke about the gains of his visits to India and Burma, which were to clarify the enemies' rumors and sabotage against Cambodia and point out the facts. He also mentioned that Indian Prime Minister Nehru supported Cambodia's measures to legally recognize the People's Republic of China, believing that it was the correct policy.

Prime Minister Sihanouk's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause from the crowd.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 28th: To celebrate Prince Sihanouk's successful visits to India, Burma, and China, tens of thousands of Phnom Penh citizens joyfully participated in various entertainment activities organized by the Cambodian government in front of the Royal Palace on the evening of the 27th.

As night fell, decorative lights were lit on Phnom Penh's public buildings, and crowds from all directions flocked to the Royal Gardens. The joyous masses filled this huge garden, where open-air screenings were held of the documentary film of Prince Sihanouk's second visit to China and other newsreels. This documentary film was produced by the China Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and presented as a gift to Prince Sihanouk and the Cambodian Ministry of Propaganda.

A concert was also held in front of the Royal Palace, and Cambodian dramas were performed.

　　西哈努克首相回到金边发表演说
    中国爱护柬埔寨　柬埔寨愿中国强
    据新华社金边27日电　柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克亲王和由他率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团在今天下午乘两架中国飞机回到金边。两万多名群众在机场上举行了欢迎大会，庆祝西哈努克亲王在中国进行的成功的和友好的访问。
    西哈努克亲王在机场上向欢迎他的群众发表了动人的长篇演说。
    西哈努克亲王说，中国政府绝对尊重和支持柬埔寨的和平中立政策，并且认为柬埔寨是执行和平中立政策的典范。
    他说，中国政府向世界宣布，柬埔寨所执行的和平中立政策不仅保卫了国家的独立，并且有利于亚洲和世界和平。世界各国应该尊重这种政策。周恩来总理希望那些侵犯柬埔寨的邻国，能够遵守万隆会议的决议同柬埔寨和平共处，不要受别人的指使或者追随殖民主义者。
    西哈努克说，中国绝对不干涉柬埔寨，中国侨民要尊重侨居国的法令和风俗习惯，并且还要帮助侨居国进步。
    西哈努克说，毛泽东主席告诉他，历史已经证明不需要对中国有任何畏惧。中国人民已经尝过外国压迫的痛苦，而中国的领土很大，不怕土地不够，因此中国不要去侵略任何国家。
    西哈努克说，我也宣布，为了更有效地解决国际问题，尤其是解决世界和平和消灭冷战的问题，柬埔寨政府支持拥有六亿人民的中国在国际会议和联合国中的席位。
    西哈努克特别提到了中国给予柬埔寨的援助。他说，中国政府又给予我们新的、无条件的无偿援助。两国贸易也要比以前扩大，并且保持平衡。
    他说，“中国希望柬埔寨能积极推进自己的工农业，建立起自己国家的独立经济，不需要接受外国的援助，甚至连中国援助也不需要。我回答他们说：‘你们的话很对，你们真诚爱护柬埔寨’”。
    他又说，“中国并不是自私地只求自己的富强，中国要把自己的成就和经验用来帮助其他的友好国家。如果柬埔寨决心和中国交朋友，就要赞成中国强盛。如果中国衰弱，怎么能够帮助柬埔寨呢？”
    西哈努克首相感谢中国人民和政府非常隆重和盛大的接待。他说，“在中国，周恩来总理，陈毅、贺龙元帅都亲自陪同我到各地参观。毛泽东主席同我进行了三次长时间的会谈；会谈以后，亲自送我到汽车旁。”
    西哈努克也谈到他访问印度和缅甸的收获，那就是澄清了敌人对柬埔寨的造谣破坏，指出了事实真相。他还提到印度总理尼赫鲁支持柬埔寨在法律上承认中华人民共和国的措施，认为那是正确的政策。
    西哈努克首相的讲话一再为群众的热烈掌声所打断。
    据新华社金边28日电　为了庆祝西哈努克亲王对印度、缅甸和中国进行的成功的访问，成千上万的金边市民27日晚上兴高采烈地参加了柬埔寨政府在皇宫前组织的各种娱乐活动。
    当夜幕低垂的时候，金边的公共建筑物上都点上了花灯，来自四面八方的人群涌向皇家花园。愉快的群众挤满了这个巨大的花园，在那里露天放映了西哈努克亲王第二次访问中国的纪录影片和其他新闻纪录片。这部纪录影片是由中国中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄的，并且作为礼物送给西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨宣传部。
    在皇宫前还举行了音乐会，并且演出了柬埔寨的戏剧。
