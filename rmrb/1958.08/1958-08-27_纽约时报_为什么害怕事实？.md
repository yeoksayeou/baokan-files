Why is the "New York Times" Afraid of the Facts?

　　On August 17th, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country pointed out at a reception held by the Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wijono Prodjodikoro, that recently, the American aggressive bloc has carried out a series of intervention activities against Indonesia, from plotting and supporting armed coups, conducting military intimidation, to employing various despicable political conspiracies. However, the Indonesian government, uniting all patriotic and democratic forces, with the support of peace-loving countries and people around the world, resolutely countered the imperialist intervention and quelled the rebellion.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks accurately reflected the facts. However, the American aggressive bloc became alarmed. On August 19th, the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of the American aggressive bloc, published an editorial, categorically denying that the United States supported the Indonesian rebel group, and openly slandered Premier Zhou Enlai's speech as "lying"!

　　The "New York Times" is known for its ability to fabricate rumors and slander, so it is not surprising that it creates a new record. However, isn't it extremely foolish for the "New York Times" to choose universally known facts to deny and use this topic to insult people?

　　For a long time, the American aggressive bloc has colluded with Indonesian rebels, supporting their separatist activities. Dulles publicly attacked the Indonesian government on February 11th as "not in accordance with the constitution," echoing the anti-government slogans of the rebels. After the rebel "government" was established in Central Sumatra on February 15th, the United States provided it with a large amount of weapons and one hundred million US dollars in aid. The US State Department even studied the issue of "recognizing" the rebel "government." When the Indonesian government forces began to suppress the rebel group, the United States repeatedly carried out military intimidation against Indonesia, and used Singapore, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan to transport military supplies and send pilots and other military personnel to the rebel group, directly participating in the military activities of the rebel group. The American pilot Pope, captured by the Indonesian government forces, is the best witness.

　　On April 15th and April 30th, Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda twice issued statements accusing the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group of helping the rebels bomb some areas of Indonesia. On May 2nd, President Sukarno gave a speech, also warning the United States not to play with fire in Indonesia. Recently, on August 17th, President Sukarno, in his speech celebrating Indonesian Independence Day, reviewed the situation of the past year and condemned the rebels for "attempting to form a common front with foreign imperialists whose purpose is to destroy the Republic and drag it into the Western military bloc."

　　Moreover, after the collapse of the rebel "government" in Central Sumatra, the United States did not abandon its support for the rebels. According to a report in the Indonesian "Eastern Star" on June 21st, Lawrence Frost, director of the US Naval Intelligence Bureau, wrote a letter to Kawilarang, one of the leaders of the Indonesian rebel group, asking them to preserve their organization and strength, and stated that "through Taiwan, the Philippines, and other channels, we will continue to assist you."

　　Can the "New York Times" deny these facts?

　　There is also a best witness that can prove that the United States supported the Indonesian rebel group, and that is the "New York Times" itself. Throughout the Indonesian rebellion, the American reactionary newspapers and news agencies carried out very blatant instigation and subversive propaganda, and the "New York Times" was one of the most frantic. Has the "New York Times" forgotten this?

　　On February 10th, when the Hussein Group made arrogant demands to the Indonesian government, the "New York Times" published an editorial, publicly approving of the demands of these rebels, and believing that their purpose was to "restore a better and more realistic government."

　　On February 24th, after the rebel "government" in Central Sumatra was established, the "New York Times" even incited the Indonesian people to no longer trust the Sukarno government, but should "establish a looser federation with a high degree of local autonomy."

　　On March 16th, the sixth day after the government forces landed in Central Sumatra, the "New York Times" published a long editorial, calling the armed rebellion of the Hussein Group a "justified" action. This editorial fanatically incited the rebel group to wage a "protracted and arduous guerrilla war" when the government forces were making smooth progress, and "absolutely cannot tolerate Java's manipulation." It shouted loudly that the rebels "must fight on, and we dare say they will do so"!

　　On April 20th, when the rebel group was losing ground, the "New York Times" still had wild ambitions. It wrote that although the rebel "government" could not "effectively exercise its functions," the "rebellious spirit" against Sukarno had not been subdued. It said venomously, "Sumatra has become a ready-made symbol of resistance to this tyranny (referring to the Indonesian government), but resistance will not be limited to one island..."

　　This is only a part of the "New York Times"'s remarks. But from these few quotes, people can fully see how far the American aggressive bloc colluded with the Indonesian rebel group! Now, this "New York Times," which frantically supported the rebel group, has actually come out to deny that the United States supported the rebel group! May I ask, gentlemen of the "New York Times," don't you yourselves feel how inconvenient it is for you to play this role of denying debts?

　　The "New York Times" tells lies itself, but slanders others for "lying," which is doubly shameless! What is the reason that makes the "New York Times" shout so shamelessly? Generally speaking, it is of course the instinct of the American aggressive bloc. But in the current situation, there are also special reasons. Recently, the American aggressors' aggressive activities in the Middle East and other parts of the world have been condemned by the world and their reputation is notorious, so it is trying to save itself from this deep valley. In Southeast Asia, while the American aggressors sent Marines to land in Singapore, threatening the independence and security of Southeast Asian countries, they also tried their best to dress themselves up as good people and engaged in appeasement activities everywhere. However, how can the fact that the United States supports the rebel group and interferes in Indonesia's internal affairs be reconciled with the behavior of a good person? Precisely because of this, the American aggressors are most afraid of people revealing these facts, and they try to deny them at all costs.

　　However, facts are facts after all. We must "listen to their words and observe their actions," and identify all hypocrites at any time. No matter what kind of beautiful coat the American aggressors put on, as long as people can pay attention to their actual actions, they will not be fooled. In particular, the people of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are directly subjected to the enslavement, threat, aggression, and plunder of American imperialism every day. No matter how many "New York Times" there are, no matter how many "Voice of America" there are, no matter how many Dulleses there are, there is no way to deny all this. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as the people of the world, must not only continue to expose the aggressive activities of US imperialism, but also unite to carry out a resolute struggle against these activities until the people of all countries achieve complete independence and freedom, and colonialism is completely eliminated from the world!

### “纽约时报”为什么害怕事实？

　　“纽约时报”为什么害怕事实？
    8月17日，我国周恩来总理在印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托举行的招待会上曾经指出，最近一个时期，美国侵略集团对印度尼西亚进行了一系列的干涉活动。从策动和支持武装政变、进行军事恫吓，到施展种种卑鄙的政治阴谋。但是印度尼西亚政府团结了一切爱国民主力量，在全世界爱好和平国家和人民的支持下，坚决地反击了帝国主义的干涉，平定了叛乱。
    周恩来总理的这些话非常确切地反映了事实。可是美国侵略集团却惊慌起来了。8月19日，美国侵略集团的喉舌“纽约时报”发表社论，矢口否认美国支持了印度尼西亚的叛乱集团，并且公然诬蔑周恩来总理的讲话“是在说谎”！
    “纽约时报”是以造谣和诬蔑的本领著名于世的，它再创造一个新的纪录，也不算稀奇。不过，“纽约时报”偏偏要选择举世周知的事实加以否认，并且借着这个题目来骂人，岂不是愚蠢之至吗？
    好久以来，美国侵略集团就勾结印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，支持他们进行分裂活动。杜勒斯在今年2月11日曾经公开攻击印度尼西亚政府“不符合宪法”，与叛乱分子的反政府口号相呼应。2月15日叛乱“政府”在中苏门答腊成立以后，美国以大量武器和一亿美元予以援助。美国国务院甚至研究过“承认”叛乱“政府”的问题。当印度尼西亚政府军对叛乱集团开始讨伐以后，美国更一再对印度尼西亚进行军事恫吓，并利用新加坡、菲律宾和台湾蒋介石集团向叛乱集团运送军火、派遣飞行员和其他军事人员，直接参与了叛乱集团的军事活动。美国飞行员鲍普被印度尼西亚政府军俘获，就是最好的人证。
    4月15日和4月30日，印度尼西亚总理朱安达曾经两次发表声明，指责美国和蒋介石集团帮助叛乱分子轰炸印度尼西亚的一些地区。5月2日，苏加诺总统发表演说，也警告过美国不要在印度尼西亚玩火。最近，8月17日，苏加诺总统在庆祝印度尼西亚国庆的演说中，又回顾了过去一年的局势，谴责了叛乱分子“企图同目的在于摧毁共和国并把它拖进西方军事集团的外国帝国主义分子结成共同的战线”。
    而且，在中苏门答腊叛乱“政府”垮台以后，美国也没有放弃对叛乱分子的支持。据印度尼西亚“东星报”6月21日报道，美国海军谍报局局长劳伦斯·弗罗斯特曾写信给印度尼西亚叛乱集团首领之一卡维拉朗，要他们保存组织和实力，并表示“通过台湾、菲律宾以及其他途径，我们将继续援助你们”。
    难道这些事实是“纽约时报”能够抵赖掉的吗？
    可以证明美国支持印度尼西亚叛乱集团的，还有一个最好的证人，那就是“纽约时报”自己。在印度尼西亚发生叛乱事件的整个过程中，美国反动报刊和通讯社进行了十分露骨的煽动和颠覆性宣传，“纽约时报”正是其中最疯狂的一个。难道“纽约时报”反倒忘记这一点了吗？
    2月10日，当侯赛尼集团向印度尼西亚政府提出狂妄要求的时候，
  “纽约时报”发表社论，公开赞成这些叛乱分子的要求，并认为他们的目的是为了“恢复较好和较现实的政府”。
    2月24日，当中苏门答腊叛乱“政府”成立以后，“纽约时报”竟煽动印度尼西亚人民再不能信任苏加诺政府了，而应该“成立一个具有高度地方自治权的比较松弛的联邦”。
    3月16日，也就是政府军在中苏门答腊登陆的第六天，“纽约时报”发表长篇社论，把侯赛尼集团的武装叛乱叫做“出师有名”的行动。这篇社论狂热地教唆叛乱集团要在政府军进展顺利的情况下，进行一场“持久和艰苦的游击战争”，而“绝不能容忍爪哇的摆布”。它大声疾呼，叛乱分子“必须战斗下去，我们敢说，他们会这样做”！
    4月20日，在叛乱集团大势已去的时候，“纽约时报”仍然野心不死。它写道：叛乱“政府”虽然不能“有效地行使职权”了，但是反对苏加诺的“叛乱精神”并未被压服。它恶毒地说，“苏门答腊成了反抗这种暴政（指印度尼西亚政府）的一种现成的象征，但是抵抗并不会限于一个岛屿……”。
    这只是“纽约时报”言论的一部分。可是从这几行引文里，人们也完全可以看到美国侵略集团同印度尼西亚叛乱集团狼狈为奸到了何等地步！现在，就是这个疯狂地支持叛乱集团的“纽约时报”居然出来否认美国支持叛乱集团！试问“纽约时报”的先生们，难道你们自己就没有感觉到，由你们出来扮演这种赖账角色，是多么不方便吗？
    “纽约时报”自己说谎，反而诬蔑别人“说谎”，真是加倍的无耻！究竟是什么原因使得“纽约时报”这样无耻地狂叫呢？一般地说，当然是美国侵略集团的本能。但就目前而论，也有其特殊的原因。最近期间，美国侵略者在中东以及在世界其他地区的侵略活动，受到全世界的谴责，臭名远扬，因此它正妄想从这深谷里挽救自己。在东南亚，美国侵略者一边派遣海军陆战队在新加坡登陆，威胁东南亚各国的独立和安全；一边又极力把自己打扮成为一个善人，到处进行拉拢活动。然而，美国支持叛乱集团，干涉印度尼西亚内政的事实，怎么能同善人的行径相调和呢？正是因为这样，美国侵略者最怕人们道破这些事实，它不顾一切地企图加以抵赖。
    但是，事实毕竟是事实。我们要“听其言而观其行”，随时识破一切伪善者。美国侵略者不论穿上什么样漂亮的外衣，只要人们能够注意它的实际行动，那就不会上当。特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家的人民，他们天天在直接受着美帝国主义的奴役、威胁、侵略和掠夺。不管有多少个“纽约时报”，不管有多少个“美国之音”，不管有多少个杜勒斯，也没有办法把这一切都抵赖掉。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民以及全世界人民，不但要不断地揭露美帝国主义的侵略活动，而且要团结起来同这些活动进行坚决的斗争，直到各国人民都取得完全的独立自由，殖民主义从世界上消灭干净！
