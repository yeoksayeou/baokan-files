Local and Foreign Experts Cooperate to Create a Miracle
　　Converting a Wood-Burning Kiln to a Coal-Burning Kiln to Fire Good Porcelain
　　The ceramic industry in Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province, has created a rare miracle in the world—building a tall, down-draft coal kiln (one kiln with one chimney, including the kiln building, with a capacity of 100 cubic meters and an inner diameter of 6 meters) with the least amount of investment and at the fastest speed. Porcelain of good quality has already been fired in this kiln.
　　Firing is an important part of the porcelain production process. Jingdezhen City has traditionally used wood-burning kilns for thousands of years, which is estimated to burn 300,000 cubic meters of wood a year. This is a serious waste of wood resources. Therefore, converting wood-burning kilns to coal-burning kilns has become an urgent and arduous task for ceramic industry workers. Recently, Comrade Ji Furun, Deputy Secretary of the Jingdezhen Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally led local and foreign experts, boldly breaking superstitions, and built a circular coal kiln. The construction of this kiln fully meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical: in the past, each set of coal kilns (two kilns with one chimney, including the factory building) required an investment of 120,000 yuan, but now one kiln with one chimney only costs 30,000 yuan; in the past, it took half a year to build a set of coal kilns, and another half a month to bake the kiln, but now it only takes seven days and nights from digging the foundation to building the coal kiln and firing porcelain; in the past, building a set of coal kilns required seven tons of steel, twelve tons of cement, and 50,000 refractory bricks, but now it does not require any steel or cement, and only one-eighth of the refractory bricks are used; ordinary kilns take 24 hours to fire porcelain, but now it only takes 18 hours. At the same time, the labor conditions of the workers have been greatly improved by eliminating the "roof" and greatly reducing the temperature.
　　During the kiln conversion process, because politics took the lead and everyone's minds were liberated, the workers put forward many suggestions that could not be found in Chinese and foreign books, but were particularly effective.
　　During this kiln conversion, all the factory directors of the porcelain factories in Jingdezhen City visited and worked on-site. Through practice, the mysterious view of kiln conversion was greatly broken. Seventy-five sets were promoted on-site. By the end of this year, Jingdezhen City will basically eliminate wood-burning kilns. (Jiangxi Daily)

### 土洋专家合作创造奇迹　柴窑改煤窑烧出好瓷器

　　土洋专家合作创造奇迹
　　柴窑改煤窑烧出好瓷器
    江西省景德镇市陶瓷工业创造了一项世界上罕见的奇迹——以最少的投资、最快的速度，建成一座高大的倒焰式煤窑（一窑一囱，包括窑房，容量一百立公方，内直径六公尺）。在这座窑内，已经烧成了质量良好的瓷器。
    烧炼，是瓷业生产过程中的一个重要环节。景德镇市千年传统下来的都是用柴窑烧瓷器，估计一年要烧掉三十万立方公尺的木材，这对于木材资源是个严重的浪费。因此，将柴窑改为煤窑，就成为陶瓷工业职工迫切而又艰巨的任务。最近，中共景德镇市委副书记吉福润同志亲自领导土洋专家，大胆破除迷信，建成了一座圆形煤窑。这座窑的建成，完全达到了多快好省的要求：过去每组煤窑（二窑一囱，包括厂房）投资需十二万元，现在一窑一囱只花了三万元，过去建一组煤窑需时间半年，烘窑又需半个月，现在从挖地基到建成煤窑并烧成瓷器只花七昼夜；过去建一组煤窑需钢铁七吨、水泥十二吨、耐火砖五万块，现在根本不用钢铁和水泥，耐火砖也只用了过去的八分之一；普通的窑烧炼瓷器需二十四小时，现在只需要十八小时。同时，由于取消了“屋顶”，大大降低了温度，改善了工人们的劳动条件。
    在改窑过程中，由于政治挂了帅，大家思想获得了解放，职工们提出了许多中外书本上所找不到根据的、功效特别显著的建议。
    这次改窑，全景德镇市各瓷厂的厂长都到实地参观和劳动，通过实践，大大打破了对改窑的神秘观点，在现场推广了七十五组。今年年底，全景德镇市将可基本上消灭柴窑。（江西日报）
