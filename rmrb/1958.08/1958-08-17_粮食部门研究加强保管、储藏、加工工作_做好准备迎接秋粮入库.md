Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th. With more grain, how should it be stored, preserved, and processed? This is a new task presented by the new situation of this year's bumper autumn harvest to the state grain departments and agricultural cooperatives. The Ministry of Grain recently convened a meeting in Nanjing of representatives from the grain systems of sixteen provinces and cities, including Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shanghai, to study and resolve this issue. The meeting demanded that all preparations for grain storage, preservation, and processing be completed before the autumn crops are harvested.

　　Henan Province's Luoyang Special District provided experience at the meeting on mobilizing the masses to run granaries on a national scale. This year's summer grain in Luoyang Special District more than doubled compared to the same period last year. The bumper harvest has brought five new contradictions to grain work: First, the state's purchase volume has increased, sales have decreased, storage is large, and warehouse capacity is insufficient; second, agricultural cooperatives are competing with the state for warehouse space; third, agricultural cooperatives lack sufficient warehouses, equipment, and technology to store large quantities of grain; fourth, there is a shortage of labor during the storage period, creating a conflict between production and grain delivery; and fifth, a large amount of equipment cannot be resolved. If these problems are not resolved in a timely manner, it will not only make grain work passive, but also cause inestimable losses to the fruits of farmers' labor. In order to solve these problems, the grain departments of this special district not only store state grain well, but also take over the grain storage work of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, a mass line method of "overall planning, unified arrangement, taking into account both the state and agricultural cooperatives, and mutual cooperation" is adopted. The grain storage work is deeply rooted in the cooperatives, relying on the masses to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural cooperatives' grain protection work. State warehouse keepers become the agricultural cooperatives' storage team leaders, responsible for specific areas, and establishing a storage network. In terms of technical guidance, grain protection technology training stations are generally established to train agricultural cooperative keepers. The grain storage work of the state and agricultural cooperatives, under the principle of clearly distinguishing between the state and agricultural cooperatives, is unified in leadership, unified in warehouse preparation, unified in acceptance, unified in storage, and unified in storage. In the month and a half of carrying out the national granary construction movement, this special district prepared large and small warehouses with a capacity of more than 1.9 billion jin, solving the contradiction of having nowhere to store the increased grain.

　　At the meeting, representatives introduced new machines and tools for grain packaging, transportation, and processing. The large number of new machines and tools that have emerged have reduced the physical labor of employees, improved work efficiency, saved farmers' grain delivery time, and eliminated queuing. Employees of the directly affiliated grain depot of the Hao County Grain Bureau in Anhui Province, after two months of hard work, created 24 kinds of tools such as conveyors, packaging machines, and automatic winches, eliminating heavy physical labor and basically realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of the grain depot. The tools improved and created by the grain system in Hubei Province generally increase work efficiency by three to ten times. If the new tools are widely used in the national grain storage and marketing departments, it is estimated that more than 100,000 people can be saved from the existing approximately 600,000 employees.

　　In terms of tuber storage, various localities have found suitable temperatures for storing sweet potatoes and potatoes, as well as processing methods such as hot blanching, freezing, and pressing of potatoes, by summarizing and studying folk storage cellar types and other storage methods. These methods provide useful experience for solving the technical problems of tuber drying.

　　The meeting proposed that the main content of the current technological innovation of the grain system is: (1) To ensure that the grain storage work of the state and agricultural cooperatives is done well, so that the unprecedentedly abundant grain this year can be safely stored without loss; (2) To improve the technology of grain processing by the state and agricultural cooperatives, improve the quality and yield of finished grain, and effectively help solve the problem of grain processing in rural areas; (3) To strive to mechanize and semi-mechanize all aspects of grain business work, and solve the current problem of insufficient manpower; (4) To vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of existing equipment, so as to "lay golden eggs", expand and increase the utilization rate of equipment, and set up more factories; (5) To vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of grain, oil, tubers and their by-products, increase material wealth for society, and increase capital accumulation for the country; (6) To promote the development of feed production and support agricultural cooperatives in developing pig raising on a large scale.

　　粮食部门研究加强保管、储藏、加工工作
　　做好准备迎接秋粮入库
    据新华社南京16日电　粮食多了，应该怎样保管、收藏和加工？这是今年秋熟大丰收的新形势，给国家粮食部门和农业社提出的新任务。粮食部最近在南京召开了河南、安徽、湖北、云南、四川和上海等十六个省市粮食系统代表会议，研究和解决这个问题。会议要求在秋熟作物登场以前，做好一切粮食保管、储藏和加工的准备工作。
    河南省洛阳专区在会上提供了发动群众全民办仓的经验。洛阳专区今年夏粮比去年同期增加一倍多。大丰收给粮食工作带来五个新的矛盾：第一，国家征购数量增加，销量减少，存量大，仓容不足；第二，农业社与国家争用仓库；第三，农业社仓房、器材、技术不足，保管大量的粮食有困难；第四，入库期间劳动力不足，生产与送粮有矛盾；第五，大量的器材无法解决。这些问题如不及时解决，不仅会使粮食工作招致被动，同时也会使农民劳动果实遭到不可估量的损失。为了解决这些问题，这个专区的粮食部门不仅保管好国家粮食，而且把农业社的粮食保管工作也包下来。因此，采取“全面规划，统一安排，国家、农业社兼顾，互相配合”的群众路线方法。把粮食保管工作一直深入到社，依靠群众，加强对农业社的保粮工作的领导，国家仓库保管员变成农业社的保管队长，分片包干，建立保管网。在技术指导上普遍建立保粮技术传授站，训练农业社保管员。使国家和农业社的粮食保管工作，在国家与农业社分清的原则下，统一领导，统一备仓，统一验收，统一入库，统一保管。这个专区在开展全民办仓运动的一个半月内，就准备了容量十九亿多斤的大小仓库，解决了粮食多了无处存放的矛盾。
    在会议上，代表们介绍了粮食包装、运输、加工等方面的新机器新工具。大量出现的新机器新工具，减轻了职工的体力劳动，提高了工作效率，节省了农民交粮时间，消灭排队现象。安徽省毫县粮食局直属粮库的职工，经过两个月的苦干，创造了输送机、包装机、自动风车等二十四种工具，消灭了重体力劳动，使粮库基本上实现半机械化和机械化。湖北省粮食系统改良和创造的工具，一般提高工效三倍到十倍。如果全国粮食保管部门和购销部门普遍使用新工具，现有约六十万职工中估计可节省十万多人。
    在薯类储藏方面，各地通过总结和研究民间储藏的窖型和其他储藏等方法，找到了甘薯和马铃薯储藏的适宜温度，以及马铃薯热烫、冷冻、压榨等处理方法，这些方法为解决薯类干制的技术问题提供了有益的经验。
    会议提出了当前粮食系统技术革新的主要内容是：（1）保证搞好国家和农业社的粮食储藏工作，使今年空前丰收的粮食能够安全储藏，不受损失；（2）提高国家和农业社粮食加工的技术，提高成品粮的质量和出品率，有力地帮助解决农村粮食加工问题；（3）努力使粮食业务工作中各个环节机械化和半机械化，解决当前人力不足的问题；（4）大搞原有设备的综合利用，做到“母鸡下蛋”，扩大和增加设备利用率，多办工厂；
  （5）大搞粮、油、薯类及其副产品的综合利用，为社会增加物质财富，为国家增加资金积累；（6）促进发展饲料生产，支援农业社大量发展养猪。
