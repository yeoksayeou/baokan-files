Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 12th: The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Lippmann, who expressed serious concern about the bankruptcy of American foreign policy. Lippmann believes that Senator Fulbright's recent speech was a "public expression of this discouragement and dismay." He said that many people in the United States "are worried that the entire structure of post-war American policy is being greatly undermined, and the United States faces the serious danger of losing control over its own affairs."

The author wrote: "Critics of the Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policy are divided into two main factions. Some believe that we may and should have sufficient power to contain, and in some people's words, eradicate the revolutionary movements centered in Moscow, Beijing, and Cairo." Lippmann said that these critics particularly complain that the government does not have enough courage and determination to use force to intervene, such as when the Iraqi revolution engulfed Western allies.

The author continued, saying that another faction believes that extremely erroneous estimates of America's existing strength and of the forces at work in the current world have largely undermined our country's post-war foreign policy. Lippmann wrote that this faction believes that the United States "will never have enough power to contain or eliminate the massive revolutionary movements of the post-war period by force." Furthermore, "attempts to suppress revolutions by force have saddled the United States with many obligations, which are difficult to fulfill without undertaking extraordinary adventures of unimaginable scale."

This faction believes that the U.S. support for Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu is a kind of "strategic blindness."

Assuring Lebanese President Chamoun that if he requests the landing of our Marines, we will do so, is another similar obligation. As for the recent London conference of the remaining members of the Baghdad Pact, our situation is embarrassing because we do not know what Mr. Dulles has promised to do in this region, which, from a strategic point of view, we can barely reach.

The author wrote that, simply put, some people think that if our military force were stronger and our intervention more resolute, we could change our unfortunate situation. Others believe that the United States has taken on too many obligations, promising others to do things beyond its capabilities. The way out of our predicament is to reduce our military obligations in the Far East and the Middle East and try to resolve the issue of our relationship with revolutionary movements.

Making such a decision is as difficult as deciding to go on a diet or to live on one's own income instead of relying on borrowing. What we are encountering is exactly what Britain and France encountered in those years. They have become accustomed to the fact that they are no longer the powerful nations they were in the nineteenth century. We are also no longer the powerful nation we were in 1945, when Russia was exhausted by the war, China was suffering from civil war, the Middle East had not yet launched an uprising, and we were intact, wealthy, and invincible.

Lippmann concluded: We can now see that the period of American hegemony has become a fleeting stage in human affairs. Our failure to adapt to this great reality of life and our clinging to the illusion of American domination is almost the undeniable reason for our repeated miscalculations in foreign policy.

It is for this reason that Dulles traveled all over the world, promising to provide American military guarantees to all countries that requested them. In this respect, Dulles behaved not as a resourceful diplomat, but as a more generous gambler than any other Secretary of State, writing blank checks with our country's blood, wealth, and honor.

### 李普曼满腹忧虑地承认　华盛顿死抱住称霸天下幻想是外交政策屡遭失败的原因

　　李普曼满腹忧虑地承认
　　华盛顿死抱住称霸天下幻想是外交政策屡遭失败的原因
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约12日讯：“纽约先驱论坛报”发表了李普曼的一篇文章，他对美国外交政策的破产感到严重忧虑。李普曼认为，参议员富布赖特最近的演说是这种“气馁和惊恐的公开表露”。他说，美国许多人“感到忧虑的是，战后美国政策的整个结构大遭破坏，美国面临着失掉对本国事务的控制的严重危险”。
    作者写道：“艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯外交政策的批评家们分为两个主要的派别。一些人认为，我们可能而且应该有足够的力量来遏止、用某些人的话来说则是根除以莫斯科、北平和开罗为中心的革命运动”。李普曼说，这些批评家们特别抱怨的是，政府没有足够的勇气和决心动用武力进行干涉，例如在伊拉克革命战争淹没西方过去盟友的时候就没有这样做。
    作者接着写道，另一派人说，对美国现有力量和对在当前世界上起作用的那些力量所作的极其错误的估计在很大程度上破坏了我国战后时期的外交政策。李普曼写道，这派人认为美国“永远不会有足够强大的力量能用武力遏止或者消除战后时期声势浩大的革命运动”。此外，“用武力制止革命的企图使得美国承担了许多义务，而不进行具有难以想像规模的特别冒险，就难以履行这些义务”。
    这派人认为，美国支持蒋介石盘踞中国沿海岛屿金门、马祖是一种“战略上的盲目行动”。
    向黎巴嫩总统夏蒙保证：假如他请求我国海军陆战队登陆，我们将照办，这是另一个同样的义务。至于说到还留在巴格达条约内的成员国不久前举行的伦敦会议，我们的处境是难堪的，因为我们不知道，杜勒斯先生已经答应在这个地区干些什么，而从战略观点来看，这个地区我们只是勉强能够达到而已。
    作者写道，简单地说，有些人以为，如果我们的武力更强大，我们的干涉更坚决，我们就可以改变倒霉的处境。也有人认为，美国已经承担了过多的义务，它答应别人做力所不及的事情。我们摆脱困境的出路就是减少我们在远东和中东的军事义务，设法解决同革命运动的关系问题。
    要作出这样的决定正像决定忌口或者不依靠借钱而依靠自己的收入过活一样困难。我们遭到的这些，实际上正是英国和法国当年的遭遇，它们对自己已经不是十九世纪那样的强国这个事实已经习惯了，我们现在也已经不是1945年那样的强国了，当时俄国被战争弄得精疲力尽，中国正遭受内战的苦难，中东还没有发动起义，而我们却完整无恙，富有而不可战胜。
    李普曼最后写道：我们现在可以看到，美国霸权时期已成了人类事业当中昙花一现的阶段，我们没能适应这个伟大的生活事实而死抱住美国称霸天下的幻想，这个事实几乎是我们在外交政策方面屡次失算的无可争辩的原因。
    正因为如此，杜勒斯才跑遍全世界，答应给于所有要求提供美国军事保障的国家以保障。在这一点上，杜勒斯表现得不是一个足智多谋的外交家，而是比任何其他一个国务卿更加慷慨的赌棍，他拿我国的鲜血、财富和荣誉滥开支票。
