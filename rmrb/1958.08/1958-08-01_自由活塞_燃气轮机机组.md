Small Information

    The free piston gas turbine unit is a very advanced power device, and it also belongs to the category of cutting-edge science in the world. Because the connecting rod mechanism used in general internal combustion engines is eliminated in the free piston engine, its structure is greatly compact, which can save a lot of metal materials and expensive anti-wear alloys in manufacturing; at the same time, the thermal efficiency (that is, the utilization rate of heat energy) of this power device is as high as 30% to 40%, which is three to five times higher than that of general steam engines. In this way, its use cost is greatly reduced. What is especially important is that it does not have high requirements for fuel and can use various heavy oils, which solves the difficulty of insufficient light oil in our country and opens up a broad road for the use of heavy oil.
    Although this is a very ideal power device, its history of being put into production is still very short. Scientific advanced countries all over the world do not yet have a set of mature design and manufacturing experience for this power device, and are still in the exploratory stage. Up to now, it is understood that capitalist countries have not yet produced such a large free piston-gas turbine unit with 3,000 horsepower. (Attached picture)

    自由活塞—燃气轮机机组
    自由活塞——燃气轮机机组是一种十分先进的动力装置，同时，它也是属于世界尖端科学范畴内的产品。由于在自由活塞发动机中取消了一般内燃机所用的曲柄连杆机构，因此就使它的结构大大紧凑，在制造中可以省掉很多金属材料与昂贵的抗磨合金；同时，这种动力装置的热效率（即热能利用率）高达30％到40％，比一般蒸汽机热效率要高三到五倍。这样，它的使用成本也就降低很多。尤其重要的是，它对燃料的要求不高，可以使用各种重油，这就解决了我国轻油不足的困难，为使用重油开辟了广阔的道路。
    虽然这是一种很理想的动力装置，可是它真正投入生产的历史还是很短的，世界各个科学先进国家，对这种动力装置还没有一套成熟的设计与制造的经验，还处于摸索阶段。截至目前为止，据了解，资本主义国家还未生产过三千马力这样大的自由活塞——燃气轮机机组。（附图片）
