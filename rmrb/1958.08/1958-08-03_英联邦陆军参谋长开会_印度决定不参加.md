Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 1st. India will not participate in the Commonwealth Army Chiefs of Staff meeting scheduled to be held in London in early August this year.

This meeting, convened by the British General Staff, is held annually.

According to the "Times of India," the West Asia crisis and the difference in views between India and Britain on this issue may be the reason why the Indian Army Chief of Staff will not attend the meeting this year.

    英联邦陆军参谋长开会
    印度决定不参加
    新华社新德里1日电　今年印度将不参加预订8月初在伦敦召开的英联邦陆军参谋长会议。
    这种由英国总参谋部召开的会议每年举行一次。
    据“印度时报”报道，西亚危机以及印度和英国在这个问题上看法的分歧可能是印度陆军参谋长今年不去出席会议的原因。
