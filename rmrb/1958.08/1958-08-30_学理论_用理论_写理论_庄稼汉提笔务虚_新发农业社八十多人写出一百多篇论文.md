　　Learn Theory, Apply Theory, Write Theory
    Peasants Take Up Pens to Engage in Metaphysics
    More Than Eighty Members of the Xinfa Agricultural Cooperative Write More Than One Hundred Papers
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Wen Shuxian reports: In the upsurge of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, more than a thousand members of the Xinfa Agricultural Cooperative in Huangshatuo Township, Tai'an County, Liaoning Province, put forward a new slogan of "Learn theory, apply theory, write theory," launching a mass movement to write theoretical articles. At present, more than 300 cooperative members and cadres are actively writing articles, and more than 80 of them have already written more than 100 papers.
    These papers were written by the peasants in the spirit of "writing about what they do." Guided by the Marxist-Leninist theory they have learned, they combine their own work, summarize experience, raise questions, and analyze and elaborate on them. For example, leading cadres of the township and cooperative party and government have written more than ten articles on some of the major issues in the township, such as "On the Political and Economic Significance of Big-Yield Fields," "On the Role of Communist Party Members," and "On the Value of Labor." Communist Youth League members and women cadres have written articles such as "On the Role of the Communist Youth League in the Great Leap Forward," "On the Labor Enthusiasm of Women," and "The Beginning of the Socialization of Domestic Labor." Production team leaders have written summaries of their work experience on the topic of "How to Be a Good Production Team Leader." Cooperative members have written articles such as "How to Be a Good Cooperative Member" and "On This Year's Wheat Harvest."
    The content of these articles is very rich, fully reflecting the Great Leap Forward situation of the Xinfa Agricultural Cooperative and the socialist spirit of the peasants. In his article "On the Political and Economic Significance of Big-Yield Fields," Liu Zhichen, the secretary of the township party committee, used the example of Huangshatuo Township creating 480 hectares of big-yield fields to discuss the emergence of high-yield records of 40,000 jin of corn per hectare. This not only forcefully refuted the right-leaning view of the "wait-and-see faction" that grain production increases are limited politically, proving the superiority of the socialist system, but also promoted the great development of agricultural production economically, increased income, and improved people's lives. Yang Hongxi, a production team leader, summarized three basic experiences in his paper "How to Be a Good Team Leader": first, follow the mass line; second, conscientiously implement the party's resolutions; and third, dare to think and dare to act, completing various tasks in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    When the Xinfa Agricultural Cooperative launched the movement to write theoretical articles, some people believed that the cadres and members of the cooperative had a low level of education, so how could they write papers? In response to this idea, the general party branch organized a debate, breaking the mysterious view of writing papers, and the township and cooperative cadres took the lead, focusing on the central work and writing papers first. Fang Chang'an, the director of the cooperative, who came from a poor peasant background and only had a primary school education, wrote four papers in a very short period of time, including "On the Value of Labor" and "What is Dialectics?" Zhang Fusheng, the secretary of the general branch, who had been a hired worker, and Wu Zhengdian, the deputy director of the cooperative, wrote articles on "The Role of Communist Party Members in Rural Areas" and "How to Be a Good Cooperative Director." In this way, they motivated the cooperative members to write theoretical articles one after another. (Attached picture)

### 学理论·用理论·写理论  庄稼汉提笔务虚  新发农业社八十多人写出一百多篇论文

　　学理论·用理论·写理论
    庄稼汉提笔务虚
    新发农业社八十多人写出一百多篇论文
    本报讯　记者温述仙报道：辽宁省台安县黄沙坨乡新发农业社上千名社员，在学习马克思列宁主义理论、毛泽东著作的热潮中，提出了“学理论，用理论，写理论”的新口号，展开一个写理论文章的群众性运动。目前积极写文章的三百多名社员和干部，已有八十多人写出了一百多篇论文。
    这些论文是农民们本着“做啥论啥”的精神写出来的。他们以所学的马克思列宁主义理论为指导，结合自己的工作，总结经验，提出问题，并进行分析阐述。如乡、社党政负责干部，就当前全乡的一些重大问题，写了“论大王田的政治经济意义”、“论共产党员的作用”、“论劳动价值”等十多篇文章。共青团员和妇女干部写了“论共青团在跃进中起到的作用”、“论妇女劳动干劲”和“家务劳动社会化的开端”等文章。生产队长们以“怎样当好生产队长”为题，写出工作经验总结的文章。社员们写了“如何当个好社员”、“论今年小麦丰收”等文章。
    这些文章的内容很丰富，充分反映了新发农业社的大跃进状况和农民们的社会主义精神面貌。乡党委书记刘芷臣写的“论大王田的政治经济意义”一文中，以黄沙坨乡创造四百八十公顷大王田为例，论述每公顷产苞米四万斤的高额丰产纪录的出现，不仅在政治上有力地批驳了观潮派的粮食增产有限论的右倾观点，证明了社会主义制度的优越性，而且在经济上推动了农业生产大发展，增加了收入，改善了人民生活。生产队长杨洪喜在他的“怎样当好队长”的论文中，总结出三条基本经验，一是走群众路线；二是认真执行党的决议；三是敢想、敢干，本着多快好省的精神来完成各项任务。
    新发农业社在开展写理论文章运动时，有人认为，社干部和社员的文化水平低，哪里能写出论文来。党总支针对这种思想，组织了辩论会，打破了写论文的神秘观点，并由乡社干部带头，围绕中心工作，先写出论文来。贫农出身的社主任方长安，只有小学文化程度，在很短时间内，他一人便写了“论劳动价值”、“什么是辩证法”等四篇论文。当过佣工的总支书记张福生和社副主任吴正典，写了“共产党员在农村中的作用”和“怎样当好社主任”的文章。这样，就带动了社员们纷纷写理论文章了。（附图片）
