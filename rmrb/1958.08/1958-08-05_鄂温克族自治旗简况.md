Brief Introduction to the Evenk Autonomous Banner

The Evenk people are one of the smallest ethnic minorities in China. They include the former "Solon," "Yakut," and "Tungus" peoples, totaling approximately ten thousand people. The majority of this ethnic group is distributed in the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, numbering about seven thousand people; others are distributed in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province. The newly established Evenk Autonomous Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the former Solon Banner of the Hulunbuir League. Within the banner, there are 2,547 Evenk people, along with 3,697 Mongolians, 1,869 Daurs, 1,265 Han Chinese, and 48 people from other ethnic groups such as Hui, Manchu, Tibetan, and Korean. The total population of the banner is 9,426 people.

The Evenk Autonomous Banner is located on the banks of the Yimin River and Hui River. It is bounded by the Heguitu Banner and Butha Banner to the east, the Chen Barag Banner (Hailar) to the north, and the New Barag Left Banner to the west and south. The total land area of the banner is 18,716 square kilometers. Among them, 9,400 square kilometers are covered by forests, and over 8,000 square kilometers are most suitable for developing animal husbandry production. There are reeds as wide as forty li and as long as two hundred li. In addition, there are underground treasures such as gold, copper, iron, coal, and crystal.

The banner has jurisdiction over six sumus. After the official establishment of the Evenk Autonomous Banner, the autonomous organs are located in Nantun. The members of the autonomous organs are mainly composed of Evenk people who exercise regional autonomy, and appropriately take into account and absorb people from various ethnic groups within the banner to participate.

Before liberation, the Evenk people and other ethnic minorities in the banner suffered from the oppression of Japanese invaders and feudal ruling classes, and were in a state of economic decline and population decline, living in hunger and cold. After liberation, they embarked on the road to economic prosperity, population growth, and national unity. The banner is mainly based on animal husbandry economy. So far, 61 pastoral cooperatives have been established, and the number of households joining the cooperatives accounts for 92% of the total number of pastoral households, basically realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. The banner currently has 140,191 head of livestock of various kinds. Compared with 1949, the net increase rate of large livestock is 78.09%, and the net increase of small livestock is about double.

Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed greatly compared with before liberation. There are now four higher primary schools and three junior primary schools, with 864 students, accounting for 85% of the banner's school-age children. There are also institutions such as Xinhua Bookstore, wired broadcasting station, cultural center, and film projection team. Before liberation, there was not a single health institution. Now there is one banner hospital, four sumu health centers, one ethnic health work team, and one maternal and child health station.

After the establishment of the Evenk Autonomous Banner, the Party and the state gave the people of all ethnic groups in the banner an even more important task: to unite more closely and further develop various economic, cultural, educational, and health undertakings with animal husbandry as the main focus. Now the people of the banner have formulated the second five-year plan and are moving towards a more prosperous and happy road.

    鄂温克族自治旗简况
    鄂温克族是我国人口最少的少数民族之一。它包括过去的“索伦”、“雅库特”及“通古斯”人，共约一万多人。这个民族大部分分布在内蒙古自治区的呼伦贝尔盟，约七千多人；其他分布在新疆维吾尔自治区和黑龙江等地。内蒙古自治区新成立的鄂温克自治旗即该区呼伦贝尔盟的原索伦旗。旗内鄂温克族人民共有二千五百四十七人，另有蒙古族三千六百九十七人，达斡尔族一千八百六十九人，汉族一千二百六十五人，回、满、藏、朝鲜等族，共四十八人。全旗人口为九千四百二十六人。
    鄂温克族自治旗位于伊敏河、辉河两岸。东界为喜桂图旗、布特哈旗，北界为陈巴尔虎旗（海拉尔），西界和南界为新巴尔虎左旗。全旗土地面积为一万八千七百一十六平方公里。其中有九千四百平方公里面积有森林复盖，八千多平方公里最适于发展畜牧业生产，有宽达四十里、长达二百多里的芦苇，此外还有金、铜、铁、煤、水晶等地下宝藏。
    全旗管辖有六个苏木，鄂温克族自治旗正式成立后，自治机关设在南屯。自治机关的组成人员，以实行区域自治的鄂温克民族人员为主要成分组成，并适当照顾和吸收旗内各民族人员参加。
    鄂温克族人民和旗内其他各少数民族人民，解放前受尽日寇和封建统治阶级的压迫，处于经济衰落，人口下降的状态，过着饥寒交迫的生活。解放后，才走上了经济繁荣、人口兴旺、民族团结的幸福道路。全旗以畜牧业经济为主，到目前为止，共建牧业社六十一个，入社户数占总牧户的92％，基本实现了对畜牧业的社会主义改造。全旗现有各种牲畜十四万零一百九十一头，和1949年相比，大牲畜纯增率为78.09％，小牲畜纯增约一倍。
    文教卫生事业方面，也比解放前大有发展。现有高等小学四所，初小三所，学生八百六十四名，占全旗学龄儿童的85％。另有新华书店、有线广播站、文化馆、电影放映队等机构。解放前没有一个卫生机构，现有旗医院一所，苏木卫生所四处，民族卫生工作队一队，妇幼保健站一处。
    鄂温克族自治旗成立后，党和国家给全旗各族人民一个更重要的任务：要更加紧密地团结在一起，进一步发展以畜牧业为主的各项经济和文教卫生事业。现全旗人民已制定了第二个五年计划，正朝着更加繁荣幸福的道路迈进。
