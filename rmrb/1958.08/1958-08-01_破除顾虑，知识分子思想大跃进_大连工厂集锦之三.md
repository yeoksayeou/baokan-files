Breaking Down Concerns, Intellectuals' Ideological Great Leap Forward
——Collection from Dalian Factories, Part Three
	Zheng Zhong
　　The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory is a large factory with nearly ten thousand people. In the Great Leap Forward in production, this factory not only did a good job in improving the leadership's work style and in carrying out mass debate on "for whom do workers labor?"; it also did a good job in the ideological Great Leap Forward among intellectuals by breaking down concerns and opening their hearts to the Party. That is to say, this factory used the method of resolving contradictions among the people to rectify all kinds of relationships, and rectified them well. This is one of the basic driving forces of the factory's Great Leap Forward in production.
　　Among the engineering and technical personnel who participated in the heart-to-heart movement in this factory, there were 357 non-Party intellectuals, of which 89% were young people aged from 20 to 30. However, many of them had long been burdened by the "trade union membership card, part of the working class" and denied that they belonged to the bourgeois intellectuals.

　　Various Views of Intellectuals
　　When the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, many intellectuals resonated with the rightists on many points of view, and 143 technicians spread rightist remarks. After the anti-rightist struggle, the rightists were discredited and the political direction of the intellectuals was corrected; however, the reactionary remarks of those intellectuals belonging to the middle-of-the-roaders had not yet been deeply excavated. After the anti-rightist struggle, many reactionary views began to be concealed.
　　Generally speaking, these middle-of-the-road intellectuals basically support the Party and socialism, but their bourgeois stance has not fundamentally changed, so they are indecisive on some specific issues. In previous movements, they showed an abnormal relationship with the Party organization. They generally had the following situations:
　　1. Placing themselves outside of various political movements, "protecting oneself wisely." Saying "do things with conscience" and "speak less to avoid trouble." Advocating "the doctrine of the mean."
　　2. Some historical problems, distrust of the Party organization, wanting to approach the Party but not daring to approach, wanting to talk about problems but not daring to talk, suspicious and nervous.
　　3. On major issues of principle, sometimes "clear," sometimes confused, attitude changing constantly, echoing others on some issues, following the crowd.
　　4. In previous political movements, when personal interests were touched, they showed passive silence, unstable emotions, sometimes cold and sometimes hot.
　　There are also some more serious problems among left-wing intellectuals, mainly:
　　1. Having gains and losses of individualism. When the Party organization often consulted with them and adopted their opinions, they showed active initiative. When their opinions were not adopted or some work did not find them to participate in the research, they showed passive and passive.
　　2. Separated from the masses, arrogant and complacent.
　　3. In dealing with the issue of "red" versus "expert," more effort was put into "expert" and little attention was paid to "red."
　　4. During the Great Blooming and Letting, some also resonated with the rightists on some non-fundamental issues.

　　Opening Hearts to the Party, Transforming into Working-Class Intellectuals
　　This heart-to-heart movement started from the Dalian City's oath-taking rally of ten thousand people from various democratic parties and non-party democratic people on April 16th, and ended on June 10th.
　　After nearly two months of heart-to-heart talks, criticism, debates, and summaries, the heart-to-heart movement was basically completed successfully. The wavering state of non-Party intellectuals cannot continue. Many of them have already changed their original political outlook; and this heart-to-heart movement has further promoted this change, further acknowledged their reactionary and erroneous political ideological viewpoints, basically clarified the major issues of principle in politics, and expressed their determination to accelerate self-transformation, strive to be leftists, to be working-class intellectuals, and to become both "red" and "expert" technical cadres. The change in the political outlook of intellectuals in the heart-to-heart movement is mainly manifested in: the continuous improvement and expansion of the left-wing ranks, the large-scale shift of middle-of-the-roaders to the left, and the further isolation, disintegration, and disintegration of the right wing. In the heart-to-heart movement, the leftists made a relatively deep review and criticism of their own ideology and work style, which more powerfully drove and influenced the middle-of-the-roaders, and the middle-of-the-roaders were also satisfied.
　　Under the "situation forcing people," the middle-of-the-roaders reviewed and criticized their reactionary and erroneous political ideological viewpoints and admitted their mistakes.
　　In this heart-to-heart movement, non-Party intellectuals comprehensively, systematically, and massively exposed their reactionary and erroneous political ideological viewpoints, which are mainly:
　　1. Resentment against the leadership of the Party, obedience in words but not in heart, some even holding a hostile attitude. Although acknowledging the leadership of the Party in principle, they denied it in specific issues. Their formula is: "The Party's superiors are good, the subordinates are a mess"; "The Party's organization is good, the Party members and activists are a mess," "Socialism must be led by the Party, but it cannot lead scientific and cultural undertakings."
　　2. Denying the advanced nature of the working class and looking down on cadres from worker backgrounds.
　　3. Denying the superiority of the socialist system and promoting Western democracy.
　　4. Resentment against various political movements, denying the necessity of transforming intellectuals.
　　5. Pursuing extreme democracy, opposing democratic centralism, pursuing so-called individual freedom, and opposing unified discipline.
　　6. Pursuing bourgeois individualism of fame and profit and a gray outlook on life.

　　After the heart-to-heart movement, the changes in non-Party intellectuals were great. The vast majority of intellectuals underwent fierce, repeated, and painful ideological struggles in the movement. As engineers Peng Dachong and Feng Hanxiang said, the heart-to-heart movement to the Party is "an unprecedented and earth-shaking great revolution of individual thought," and "is in an unprecedented tense and painful ideological struggle," "In this struggle, it is necessary to examine and analyze the ugly and dirty things in one's own thoughts, to admit that these things are from oneself, to deny one's own past ugly thoughts, and to trace the source of these ugly thoughts. All this is indeed very painful."

　　The Abundant Fruits of Ideological Struggle
　　As a result of the ideological struggle, people who had consistently failed to tell the Party and the masses the truth became people who spoke the truth eloquently. An engineer from the Infrastructure Section said: "After the anti-rightist struggle, I thought it would be more difficult for the Party to transform intellectuals, because after the anti-rightist struggle, intellectuals would not talk about their inner thoughts, and I myself held the attitude of not talking about my inner thoughts. In this way, the Party could not carry out transformation. I didn't expect another heart-to-heart movement to the Party. This time, not only today's inner thoughts were revealed, but also the inner thoughts of the past."
　　As a result of the ideological struggle, the essence of the "middle road" and "the doctrine of the mean" was revealed. An engineer from the Design Section reviewed and criticized his two-faced approach of criticizing the anti-Party remarks of rightist Huang Yuhong at the meeting, but then telling rightist Huang Yuhong after the meeting, "What time is it now, and you are still saying these things."
　　As a result of the ideological struggle, people who had been uneasy for a long time were relieved of their burdens. Engineer Xue Renqiu of the Casting Workshop had rightist remarks during the blooming and letting period, and his attitude was somewhat abnormal during the anti-rightist struggle. When the masses exposed that he had said in the section, "Under the whole world, there is no land that is not the king's land, and on the shores of the land, there is no subject that is not the king's subject. How dare Mi Heng beat the drum and scold Cao?" Xue's attitude was very unnatural and he did not dare to admit it. Instead, he said, "What I said was 'Under the whole world, there is no section member who is not a section member.'" Since then, Xue has been less bold in his work, always thinking: I don't know which day it will be my turn to be struggled against. This heart-to-heart movement he felt was a very good opportunity. After a fierce ideological struggle, he thoroughly confessed his reactionary political ideological viewpoints and made a profound criticism. Now he feels very comfortable.
　　Young intellectuals who have long been burdened with the "trade union membership card" in this heart-to-heart movement, they used their own words and deeds to show that they are bourgeois intellectuals. As design section engineer Feng Hanxiang said: "Through the analysis of specific materials, I admitted that I am a bourgeois intellectual. When I first raised the bourgeois intellectual, I was very disgusted in my mind, and I felt that the petty bourgeois intellectual had become a bourgeois intellectual after the continuous education of the Party! I felt that this statement was deliberately belittling the progressive side of the intellectual and打击打击知识分子的积极性. Because I had this resentment, it hindered my ideological transformation. But after the heart-to-heart, self-criticism, concentrated criticism, reading documents, and analyzing specific ideological activities, I felt that everything I did was from the bourgeois standpoint, analyzed the problem from the bourgeois point of view, and the consequences were nothing but damage to the interests of the revolution."
　　In this heart-to-heart movement, all kinds of bourgeois individualism were basically discredited, and the reactionary and harmful nature of bourgeois individualism was recognized as "the source of all evils" and "the gate of all diseases."

　　In short, the heart-to-heart movement had a profound impact on the thinking of every intellectual, and the ideological struggle was repeated and fierce. For example, in self-criticism, many people always criticized three or four times before finally criticizing more thoroughly and deeply. From the degree of profoundness of the criticism, it basically met the requirements of truth, depth, and thoroughness.

　　A Situation of Relaxed Mood and Uplifted Spirit Appeared
　　As a result of the heart-to-heart movement, a situation of relaxed mood, uplifted spirit, and active work has emerged among intellectuals, which is mainly manifested in the following four aspects:
　　1. Improved relations with the Party organization and Party members. Now they are taking the initiative to seek help from the Party organization and Party members, reporting their ideological situation to the Party organization in a timely manner, and often talking with the leading comrades and Party member comrades of the Party branch.
　　2. Intellectuals are more united. The heart-to-heart movement dispelled mutual suspicions, broke through emotions, and developed mutual help and mutual criticism.
　　3. Put down the airs of bourgeois intellectuals, and the relationship with the workers has changed. Actively support workers' rationalization proposals, absorb workers' opinions in design and process work, and a new atmosphere of close integration of technicians and workers has emerged in technical work, and actively participate in mass activities and integrate with the masses. In the general line propaganda, many elderly engineers and young technicians twisted Yangko with the masses.
　　4. Work is active and initiative, and the enthusiasm is rising.
　　The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has consistently implemented the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming bourgeois intellectuals throughout the heart-to-heart movement. The heart-to-heart is completely conscious and voluntary. In criticism and debate, you can stick to your own opinions and reserve your own opinions. Other people's opinions cannot be imposed on others.
　　In the heart-to-heart movement, bourgeois intellectuals had four fears: first, afraid of being current rightists; second, afraid of being typical criticisms "unbearable," some people said "heart-to-heart thoroughly, future criticisms are uncomfortable"; third, afraid of leadership distrust; fourth, afraid of the masses looking at them differently and looking down on them. Many people have repeatedly considered whether to stick to the old position or reluctantly give it up. As a result of the ideological struggle, the old views were reluctantly abandoned. The leaders constantly explained the Party's policies, dispelled concerns, and resolutely opposed coercive methods.
　　There are criticisms, encouragements, struggles, and inductions. That is, there must be positive education and enlightenment induction, but also mass criticism and "struggle" (struggle against bad ideas and bad attitudes, not struggle against people). Encouraging induction is mainly the positive education of the leaders and taking "samples," setting up models of advanced ideas and advanced figures. This is the main thing, but it is not enough to have only positive aspects, and mass criticism must be more effective. For example, in the process of heart-to-heart, most people were enlightened by positive education, inspired by models, dispelled their concerns, and actively opened their hearts, but there were also some people whose attitude was still not honest and wanted to slip away. This is not a problem of understanding, or a problem of concern, but a problem of attitude, which must be promoted through mass criticism. The method of mass comparison and evaluation is actually mass criticism.

    破除顾虑，知识分子思想大跃进
    ——大连工厂集锦之三
  　郑重
    大连机车车辆厂是近万人的大工厂。这个工厂在生产大跃进中不仅领导上改进工作作风做得好，工人群众为谁劳动的大鸣大放大辩论进行得好；而且在知识分子中破除顾虑向党交心的思想大跃进也做得好。这就是说，这个工厂用解决人民内部矛盾的方法，把各种关系都整了一次，而且都整得好，这是这个工厂生产大跃进的基本动力之一。
    这个工厂参加交心运动的工程技术人员中有非党知识分子三百五十七名，其中从二十岁到三十岁的青年占89％。但有不少人却长期背着“有工会会员证，是工人阶级的一部分”的包袱，否认自己是属于资产阶级的知识分子。
    知识分子的各种各样观点
    在右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，有许多知识分子在许多观点上和右派共鸣，有一百四十三名技职人员散布了右派言论。经过反右派斗争，斗臭了右派分子，端正了知识分子的政治方向；但是，那些属于中间派的知识分子的反动言论还没有来得及深挖。反右派斗争以后，有许多反动观点却开始隐蔽下去。
    从总的方面来说，这些中间派的知识分子基本上是拥护党和拥护社会主义的，但资产阶级的立场基本上没有改变，因而在一些具体问题上则表现摇摆不定。在历次运动中表现对党组织的关系不正常，他们大致有如下的几种情况：
    1、把自己置身于各种政治运动之外，“明哲保身”。说“凭良心作事”“少说话免得惹祸”。主张“中庸之道”。
    2、历史上有些问题，对党组织不信任，想接近党又不敢接近，有问题想谈又不敢谈，疑神疑鬼，神经过敏。
    3、在大是大非问题上，有时“明朗”，有时糊涂，态度变化无常，对一些问题随声附和，人云亦云。
    4、在历次政治运动中，当触犯到个人利益的时候，表现消极沉默，情绪不定，时冷时热。
    在左派知识分子中也还有一些比较严重的问题，其中主要是：
    1、有患得患失的个人主义，当党组织经常和他们商量问题采纳了他们的意见的时候，就表现积极主动，没有采纳他们的意见或有些工作没有找他们参加研究的时候，就表现消极被动。
    2、脱离群众，骄傲自满。
    3、在对待红与专的问题上，对“专”下的功夫较大，不注意红。
    4、大鸣大放期间，在一些非根本性的问题上，有的也和右派有共鸣。
    向党交心，改造成为工人阶级知识分子
    这次交心运动是从4月16日大连市召开的各民主党派、无党派民主人士万人向党交心誓师大会开始，至6月10日结束的。
    经过近两个月的交心、批判、辩论、小结，基本上胜利地完成了交心运动。非党知识分子的动摇状态不可能继续下去，其中有不少人已在改变他们原来的政治面貌；而这次交心运动就更加促进了这种改变，进一步承认了自己的反动的错误的政治思想观点，基本上明确了政治上的大是大非问题，表示决心加速自我改造，争取当左派，当工人阶级的知识分子，成为又红又专的技术干部。在交心运动中知识分子政治面貌的改变主要表现在：左派的队伍不断的提高和扩大，中间分子大量地向左转，右派进一步地孤立和分化瓦解。左派在交心运动中，对自己的思想作风有了比较深刻的检查批判，这就更加有力地带动和影响了中间分子，中间分子也感到满意。
    中间分子在“形势逼人”的情况下，检查批判了自己反动的错误的政治思想观点，承认了自己的错误。
    在这次交心运动中非党知识分子全面地系统地大量地暴露出了他们的反动的错误的政治思想观点，这主要是：
    1，对党的领导有反感，口服心不服，有的甚至抱敌视态度，虽然在原则问题上承认党的领导，但在具体问题上却否定他们的公式就是：“共产党上级好，下级一团糟”；“党的组织好，党员、积极分子一团糟”，“社会主义必须由党领导，但对科学文化事业领导不了”。
    2，否认工人阶级的先进性，瞧不起工人出身的干部。
    3，否认社会主义制度的优越性，宣扬西方民主。
    4，对各种政治运动有反感，否认对知识分子改造的必要性。
    5，追求极端民主，反对民主集中，追求所谓个性自由，反对统一的纪律。
    6，追求名利的资产阶级个人主义和灰色的人生观。
    经过交心运动，非党知识分子的变化很大。绝大多数知识分子在运动中都进行了激烈的反复的痛苦的思想斗争。这正如工程师彭大充、冯翰湘所说的，向党交心运动是“史无前例的，翻天覆地的个人思想大革命”，是“处于前所未有的紧张的痛苦的思想斗争中”，“在这斗争过程中，要检查分析自己思想中的丑恶的肮脏的东西，要承认这些东西是出于自己的，要否定自己过去的丑恶思想，又要追查这些丑恶思想的来源，这一切确是很痛苦的”。
    思想斗争的丰硕果实
    思想斗争的结果，使过去一贯对党对群众不讲真心话的人，成了滔滔不绝的讲真心话的人了。基建科一个工程师说：“反右派斗争以后我认为党对知识分子进行改造更加难了，因为反右派斗争以后知识分子更不谈心里话了，我自己也抱着不谈心里话的态度。这样党就无法来进行改造。没想到又来一个向党交心运动，这一交，不但交出今天的心里话，连过去的心里话也都交出来了。”
    思想斗争的结果，揭开了“中间道路”、“中庸之道”的实质。设计科一个工程师检查批判了自己在会上虽然批判了右派分子黄与宏的反党言论，但会后就对右派分子黄与宏讲：“现在是什么时候，你还讲这些话”的两面派手法。
    思想斗争的结果，使长期惶惶不安的人卸下了包袱，铸造车间的工程师薛纫秋在鸣放期间有右派言论，反右派斗争期间态度就有些反常，在斗争其他右派分子的时候，群众揭发了他在科内曾讲过“普天之下，莫非王土，率土之宾，莫非王臣，弥衡焉敢击鼓骂曹乎”之后，薛的态度很不自然，不敢承认，反而说“我说的是普天之下，莫非科员”。自此以后，薛工作更不大胆，总是想：不知哪一天就该斗争到我的头上。这次交心运动他感到是一个很好的机会，经过激烈的思想斗争彻底交代了自己的反动政治思想观点，作了深刻的批判，现在心情很舒畅。
    长期背着有“工会会员证”包袱的青年知识分子，在这次交心运动中，他们用自己的一言一行，说明了自己是资产阶级知识分子。如设计科工程师冯翰湘说：“通过具体材料的分析，我承认了我是资产阶级知识分子。在开始提资产阶级知识分子的时候，我思想上反感很大，觉得小资产阶级知识分子经过党的不断教育却变成资产阶级知识分子！觉得这种提法是党故意贬低知识分子进步的一面，打击了知识分子的积极性，由于我有这种反感，就对自己的思想改造起了障碍的作用。但是经过交心，自我批判，集中批判，阅读文件，分析具体思想活动，我觉得我的所作所为无一不从资产阶级立场出发，以资产阶级观点分析问题，而其后果也无一不损害革命的利益”。
    在这次交心运动中，基本上是搞臭了形形色色的资产阶级个人主义，认识到资产阶级个人主义的反动性和危害性，是“万恶之源”“百病之门”。
    总之，交心运动对每一个知识分子的思想都有深刻的触动，思想斗争又是反复的、激烈的。如在自我批判中有许多人总是三次四次地批判，最后才批判得比较彻底比较深刻。从批判深刻程度来看，也基本上达到了真、深、透的要求。
    出现了心情舒畅精神振奋的局面
    交心运动的结果，在知识分子中间已经出现了心情舒畅，精神振奋，工作积极的局面，这主要表现在如下四个方面：
    1、改善了与党组织和党员之间的关系，现在他们是主动的取得党组织和党员的帮助，及时向党组织汇报自己的思想情况，同党支部的领导同志和党员同志经常的谈心。
    2、知识分子中间更加团结。交心运动解开了相互的怀疑，打破了情面，展开了互相帮助和互相批评。
    3、放下了资产阶级知识分子的架子，和工人的关系改变了，积极支持工人合理化建议，在设计工艺工作中吸收工人的意见，在技术工作上出现了技术人员和工人密切结合的新风气，并且积极地参加了群众性活动，和群众打成一片。在总路线宣传中许多老年工程师和青年技术员同群众一起扭秧歌。
    4、工作积极主动，干劲上升。
    大连机车车辆厂的交心运动自始至终地贯彻执行了党的团结、教育、改造资产阶级知识分子的方针。交心完全是自觉自愿的，在批判和辩论中可以坚持自己意见保留自己意见，别人的意见不能强加于人。
    在交心运动中，资产阶级知识分子有四怕思想：一怕当现行右派；二怕当典型批判“受不了”，有人说“交心交的透，将来批判不好受”；三怕领导不信任；四怕群众另眼相看，瞧不起。有许多人反复考虑过是坚持旧立场呢？还是忍痛丢掉呢？思想斗争的结果是忍痛丢掉旧观点，领导在此期间不断地交代党的政策，解除顾虑，坚决反对强迫命令的办法。
    有批评，有鼓励，有斗争，有诱导。这就是既要有正面教育和启发诱导，又要有群众性的批评和“斗争”（指向坏思想，坏态度作斗争，而不是斗争人）。鼓励诱导，主要是领导正面教育和拿“样板”，树立先进思想和先进人物的标兵，这是主要的，但光有正面的还不够，还必须有群众性的批评效果才会更大。如在交心过程中，大部分人经过正面教育，受了标兵的启发，解除了顾虑，积极交心，但也有部分人，态度仍不老实，想滑过去，这就不是认识问题，顾虑问题，而是态度问题，这就要通过群众性的批判来推动才行，用群众对照评比的办法，实际上就是群众性的批评。
