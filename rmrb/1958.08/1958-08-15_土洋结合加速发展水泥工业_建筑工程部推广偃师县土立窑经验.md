　　Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Accelerate Cement Industry Development
　　Ministry of Construction Engineering Promotes Yanshi County's Indigenous Vertical Kiln Experience

    (By our newspaper) The Ministry of Construction Engineering recently held a national cement conference in Beijing, determining to promote the experience of Henan Province in producing high-grade cement using indigenous methods, extensively mobilizing the masses, and adopting the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay" to accelerate the development of the cement industry.

    The conference criticized the idea of some people who wanted to solely rely on building new, modern, and mechanized cement plants to increase cement production, and proposed to extensively mobilize the masses to produce cement in large quantities using indigenous methods. Representatives from Henan Province introduced at the meeting their experience in producing high-grade cement using indigenous methods. In 1957, this province could not produce even one ton of cement. In 1958, the province needed a total of 860,000 tons of cement, but the state only allocated 120,000 tons, a difference of 740,000 tons. In order to solve this problem, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee personally took charge and successively convened three battlefield meetings, summarizing and promoting the experience of Zhuge Township in Yanshi County in producing high-grade cement using indigenous vertical kilns, requiring every township and commune to establish cement plants. After indigenous cement plants were widely established, they further mobilized the masses and created a large number of wooden and stone grinding tools. From mid-February to the end of May, more than 1,200 indigenous cement plants were built throughout the province. The annual plan is to establish more than 3,000 cement plants, producing 600,000 tons of cement.

    The conference summarized the benefits of Henan's indigenous methods of producing high-grade cement: first, the construction time is fast, and it can be completed in ten days to a month; second, the investment is small, generally only requiring a few thousand or even a few hundred yuan; third, it requires less steel materials and mechanical equipment, and even does not require steel materials and mechanical equipment; fourth, the production technology is simple and easy to learn.

    Representatives from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions all expressed their willingness to learn from Henan's experience, and all put forward specific plans for producing cement using indigenous methods at the meeting. The Ministry of Construction Engineering also decided to establish a pilot plant in Huolu County, Hebei Province, using various forms of indigenous methods to produce high-grade cement, while experimenting with production, while summarizing and improving it from a scientific and theoretical point of view, to help various regions solve the main technical problems in plant construction and production.

　　土洋结合加速发展水泥工业
　　建筑工程部推广偃师县土立窑经验
    本报讯　建筑工程部最近在北京召开全国水泥会议，确定推广河南省用土办法生产高标号水泥的经验，广泛发动群众，采取“土洋结合，以土为主”的办法，加速发展水泥工业。
    会议批判了有些人想单纯依靠新建现代化、机械化水泥厂来增产水泥的思想，提出要广泛发动群众，大量用土办法生产水泥。河南省的代表在会上介绍了他们用土办法生产高标号水泥的经验。这个省1957年连一吨水泥也不能生产。1958年全省共需水泥八十六万吨，国家只分配给十二万吨，相差七十四万吨。为了解决这一问题，省委第一书记亲自动手，先后召开了三次战地会议，总结推广了偃师县诸葛乡用土立窑生产高标号水泥的经验，要求乡乡社社都办水泥厂。土水泥厂普遍建立起来以后，他们又进一步发动群众，创造了大批木制、石制的粉磨工具。从2月中旬到5月底，全省就建成土水泥厂一千二百多个。全年计划建立三千多个水泥厂，生产水泥六十万吨。
    会议总结了河南用土办法生产高标号水泥的好处：一是建厂时间快，十几天到一个月就可以建成；二是投资少，一般只要几千元、几百元就可以；三是需要钢铁材料和机械设备少，甚至不用钢铁材料和机械设备；四是生产技术简单易学。
    各省、市、自治区代表都表示要学习河南的经验，在会上都提出了用土办法生产水泥的具体计划。建筑工程部还决定在河北省获鹿县搞一个用各种形式的土法生产高标号水泥的试点厂，一边试验生产，一边从科学理论上加以总结提高，帮助各地解决建厂和生产中的主要技术问题。
