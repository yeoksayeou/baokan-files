Editorial Notes:

    The Red Flag of High Yielding Oil Crops
    The Yinghu Cooperative in Jinjiang, Fujian, achieved a peanut yield of over 13,000 jin per mu, which is the highest national record to date and an unprecedented achievement.
    This year, the high peanut yield in Fujian is not limited to a few small-scale experimental fields. Taking the 1,300-plus mu of peanut fields in the Yinghu Cooperative as an example, the already harvested 250-plus mu have achieved an average yield of over 2,100 jin per mu. Compared with the usual yield of only about 200 jin per mu last year, the increase is not tens of percent, but nearly ten times. The bumper peanut harvest in Fujian Province, especially the peanut "satellite" launched by the Yinghu Cooperative, has brought great encouragement to the people of the whole country. Facts have proved that not only can grain achieve high yields, but oil crops can also achieve high yields.
    In the past, due to the low yield per unit area of ​​crops in our country, the rations of staple food and cooking oil were tight. However, this year's Great Leap Forward has completely changed the situation. As a result of this year's widespread bumper harvest in rural areas, the problem currently facing us is no longer whether there is enough food to eat, but what to do with the surplus grain? With the change in the grain situation, we can use more effort to solve the problem of oil crops. Chairman Mao pointed out during his recent inspection of Xushui: Next year, we should grow more wheat, oil crops and vegetables to meet the needs of the people. Today's news from the Yinghu Cooperative not only shows that more oil crops can be grown next year, but also that high yields can be achieved. We firmly believe that as long as we follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of high oil crop yields, in the near future, the situation of oil crop production and supply in our country will undergo unprecedented and tremendous changes, just like grain.

    油料作物高产的红旗
    福建晋江英湖社花生亩产一万三千多斤，这是截至目前为止的全国最高纪录，也是史无前例的成就。
    今年福建的花生高产，并不仅仅限于若干小面积的试验田，就以英湖社的一千三百多亩花生地为例，其中已经收打的二百五十多亩，平均亩产已达到了二千一百多斤，同去年一般每亩只产二百来斤比起来，增长的幅度不是百分之几十，而是近十倍的增加。福建省花生的大丰收，特别是英湖社放出的花生“卫星”，给全国人民带来了莫大的鼓舞，事实证明，不仅粮食可以高额丰产，油料作物也同样可以高额丰产。
    过去，由于我国农作物的单位面积产量很低，口粮和食油的定量都比较紧。但是，今年一个大跃进，形势就完全改观了。今年农村普遍丰收的结果，当前摆在我们面前的问题，已经不是粮食够不够吃，而是粮食多了怎么办？粮食情况变化了，我们就有可能用更多的力量去解决油料的问题。毛主席最近视察徐水时曾经指出：明年要多种小麦、油料和蔬菜，以满足人民的需要。今天英湖社的消息，不仅说明明年可以多种油料，而且还可以高额丰收。我们深信，只要遵循着毛主席指示的方向，高举起油料高额丰收的旗帜，在不久的将来，我国油料生产和供应的情况，也会像粮食一样发生空前巨大的变化。
