    "Post-Editor's Note" Raises Important Questions
    After reading the "Post-Editor's Note" – "In the Midst of Happiness" – on page 5 of the People's Daily on July 29th, I felt it was very well written. The number of pigs raised nationwide in the second quarter of this year has reached 180 million, averaging 1.5 pigs per farming household, basically meeting the 1962 requirements stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). This is indeed something to make people happy. However, in addition to pointing this out, the editor also raised an important question based on the opinions reflected in readers' letters: if pig production develops but the work of the purchasing departments does not keep up, then the result will not only be that people in some areas feel the meat supply is tight, but it will also affect the farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs. This question is very sharp and serves as a great reminder to the pig purchasing departments. It reminds the pig purchasing departments to quickly keep up with their work to adapt to the great leap forward in pig production.

    “编后”提出了重要问题
    读了人民日报7月29日第五版上的“编后”——“高兴之余”，感到写的很好。今年第二季度全国养猪数量已达一亿八千万头，每一农户平均一头半，基本上达到了农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的1962年的要求，这的确是使人们高兴的事情。但是编者除了指出这一点外，而且根据平日读者来信反映的意见，在高兴之余提出了一个重要的问题：如果生猪生产发展了，收购部门的工作没有跟上，那么，结果就不仅仅是有些地区的人民感到肉食供应紧张，而且会影响到农民养猪的积极性。这个问题提的很尖锐，对生猪收购部门是很大的启示。它提醒生猪收购部门注意：使自己的工作迅速跟上去，适应生猪生产大跃进的形势。
