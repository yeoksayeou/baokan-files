Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 13th: Iraqi newspapers attach great importance to the role played by the Soviet Union in safeguarding the independence of the people of the Middle East.

    "Al-Umma" (The Nation) newspaper, commenting on the repeated warnings issued by the Soviet Union to the United States and Britain, stated: "The Soviet Union, closely concerned with maintaining world peace and protecting the independence of the liberated Arab countries (the Soviet Union truly cherishes their friendship), will never allow British and American troops to gather in the Middle East to suppress national independence movements, support the enemies of the people, and ultimately encircle the Soviet Union." It emphasized that the Soviet Union has repeatedly safeguarded the independence of Arab countries and defended world peace due to its solemn stance against imperialism and all forces that endanger world peace and the people of all countries.

    Referring to the fact that the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Asia and Europe are closely watching the emergency meeting held at the United Nations, the newspaper pointed out, "If the conscience of the whole world succeeds in forcing the invading forces to withdraw from Jordan and Lebanon, this will be a very good result. Otherwise, the Western imperialist forces will face the great anger of all peace-loving countries in the world. This is the great significance of the speeches of the leaders of the free people, especially the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China."

    "Al-Hurriyah" (Freedom) newspaper, in a commentary entitled "Our Struggle Against Imperialism Is Not Yet Over," said: "Without a doubt, imperialism has no hope of regaining the position and influence it had in the Middle East a year ago. However, they are undoubtedly doing everything they can to maintain everything they now possess."

    The commentary concluded: "Therefore, we must always be vigilant and not forget that we are engaged in a great struggle; the struggle will never stop until the last inch of Arab land is liberated."

　　伊拉克舆论强调指出
　　苏联维护中东人民的独立
    新华社巴格达13日电　伊拉克报纸十分重视苏联在维护中东人民的独立方面所起的作用。
    “国家报”在评论苏联一再向美英发出的警告说：“密切关心维护世界和平和关心保卫解放了的阿拉伯国家（苏联真正珍视它们的友谊）的独立的苏联，决不允许英美军队在中东集结来镇压民族独立运动、支持人民的敌人以及最后来包围苏联。”它强调指出，苏联已经多次地维护了阿拉伯国家的独立，并由于它对帝国主义和一切危害世界和平和危害各国人民的势力所采取的庄严立场而保卫了世界和平。
    在谈到苏联和欧亚两洲其他爱好和平的国家都正在密切注视着在联合国举行的紧急会议时，这家报纸指出，“如果全世界的良心成功地迫使侵略军从约旦和黎巴嫩撤退，这就将是一个很好的结果，否则西方帝国主义军队就将面对全世界所有爱好和平国家的极大愤怒。这是自由人民，特别是苏联和中华人民共和国的领袖们的演说的重大意义。”
      “自由报”在一篇题为“我们同帝国主义的斗争还没有结束”的评论中说：“毫无疑问，帝国主义已经没有希望再恢复一年前它在中东的地位和影响了。但是，它们无疑正在竭尽所能企图保持它们现在所拥有的一切。”
    评论最后说：“因此，我们必须经常提高警惕，不要忘记我们进行着伟大的斗争；不到阿拉伯的最后一寸土地获得解放，斗争是永不停止的。”
