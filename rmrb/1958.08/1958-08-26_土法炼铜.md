Indigenous Copper Smelting
Tao Yuan

　　Indigenous copper smelting not only requires little investment and is quick to build, but also yields great results and high production. Generally, the method of smelting with a blast furnace is used. Although the furnace forms used in various places are different, the principle of the smelting process is the same.

　　Copper ore is a type of rock. Copper ore contains copper-containing minerals and other metallic elements, as well as other minerals, gangue, and impurities. Classified according to the nature of the minerals, it can be divided into: copper sulfide ores (such as chalcopyrite, chalcocite, etc.) and copper oxide ores (such as malachite, chrysocolla, etc.).

　　Currently, the general process of indigenous copper smelting is to first roast the ore and then smelt it. Since copper sulfide ores are mainly composed of sulfides containing copper and iron, if the furnace charge contains too much sulfur, good blister copper and matte cannot be smelted (because it is impossible to remove a lot of sulfur during the smelting process). Therefore, the fine ore must first be roasted in a roasting furnace to dissociate the various minerals into oxides and sulfides, removing excess sulfur and leaving a portion of the sulfur to be removed during the smelting process. Roasting not only desulfurizes but also ensures that the entire furnace charge is well mixed. The moisture evaporates, and the furnace charge is heated, which is also beneficial to smelting.

　　Copper oxide ores do not have a high sulfur content and can be smelted directly in the furnace without roasting.

　　In a blast furnace, there are three methods for smelting copper furnace charges:

　　1. Reduction Smelting: If the ore belongs to the copper oxide ore category, this method can be used for smelting. Since most of the copper oxide ore is composed of oxides, a certain amount of coke must be added (to reduce the oxides), and air is blown in (to aid combustion), so that the oxides are reduced to blister copper and some matte in the furnace. In order to create slag, a flux of silicon dioxide (acidic) or carbon (alkaline) must be added.

　　2. Autogenous Smelting and Semi-Autogenous Smelting: If the ore is a copper sulfide ore, this method is used for smelting. Because this type of ore contains relatively more sulfides, a small amount of coke must be added (1%—3% or 3%—12%). The insufficient heat during smelting can be supplemented by the heat released during the oxidation of sulfur and iron in the furnace charge. At the same time, a flux must be added to create slag.

　　In short, the ore is reduced by carbon in the blast furnace, dissolved by the combustion of carbon dioxide, melted by the heat released during oxidation, slag is created by the action of the flux to remove impurities, and finally smelted into blister copper and matte.

　　When smelting with a blast furnace, because air must be blown in, the furnace charge must be in lumpy form. If it is concentrate powder, it must be sintered before being charged into the furnace to prevent it from being blown away by the blown-in air.

　　土法炼铜

    土法炼铜，不仅投资少，建设快，而且收效大，产量多。一般是采用鼓风炉熔炼的方法来炼铜。虽然各地用的炉子形式不同，但冶炼过程的原理是相同的。
    铜矿石是一种岩石。在铜矿石里有含铜的矿物和其他金属元素，还有其他矿物和脉石、杂质。按矿物的性质来分类，可分为：硫化铜矿（如黄铜矿、辉铜矿等）和氧化铜矿（如孔雀石、矽孔雀石等）。
    目前，土法炼铜的一般过程是，先经过焙烧，然后熔炼。由于硫化铜矿里主要是由包含铜、铁的硫化物组成，如果炉料中含硫过多，熔炼时就不能炼出好的粗铜和冰铜来（因为在熔炼过程中不可能去掉很多硫），因此，必须先把细矿石放入焙烧炉内焙烧，使各种矿物离解，成为氧化物及硫化物，除去过多的硫，留下一部分硫在熔炼过程中去掉。经过焙烧，不仅能脱硫，而且能使全部炉料很好的混合，其中水分蒸发，炉料被烧热，这对熔炼也有好处。
    氧化铜矿石含硫量不高，可以不必经过焙烧，直接把矿石放到炉子里熔炼。
    在鼓风炉中，熔炼铜炉料有三种方法：
    一、还原熔炼：如果矿石属于氧化铜矿一类，可以用这种方法熔炼。由于在氧化铜矿里，大部分是氧化物，因此要加进一定量的焦炭（是使氧化物还原），鼓入空气（帮助燃烧），使氧化物在炉子里还原成粗铜及部分冰铜；为了造渣，必须加入熔剂二氧化矽（酸性）或碳（碱性）。
    二、自热熔炼和半自热熔炼：矿石是硫化铜矿类的，就用这种方法熔炼。因为，在这种矿石里含有比较多的硫化物，必须加入少量的焦炭（1％—3％或3％—12％）。熔炼时不足的热量，可以借炉料中的硫和铁氧化时放出的热量来补充。同时必须加入熔剂造渣。
    总之，矿石在鼓风炉里借炭还原，借二氧化炭燃烧，借氧化时放出的热量熔解，由熔剂的作用造渣，去掉杂质，最后熔炼成粗铜及冰铜。
    用鼓风炉熔炼时，由于要鼓入空气，因而炉料必须成块状，如果是精矿粉，必须经烧结后才能入炉，以免被鼓入的空气吹走。
