　　Why Pig Procurement Work Was Not Done Well

Currently, the market faces a problem: although pig production has developed, procurement has not been successful, and therefore the supply of pork cannot meet the needs of the people's lives and exports.

This year, driven by the great leap forward in agricultural production, pig production in various parts of the country has greatly developed. According to the Ministry of Agriculture's statistics, by the end of the second quarter, the number of pigs raised nationwide had reached more than 184.4 million, an increase of 26.4% compared with the end of 1957, exceeding this year's national plan by 22.9%. Looking at the national situation, the number of pigs raised in all provinces (regions) and cities has increased compared with last year, many of which are fat pigs. So, what are the reasons why pig procurement is not good in many areas? First of all, during the rectification movement, in the process of criticizing the lack of a strong production perspective in the commercial system (criticizing the lack of a strong production perspective was necessary), the criticism of "purchase, sale, transfer, storage, profit" was inappropriately carried out, leading some cadres to have a wrong idea that commercial departments can only embody the production perspective by running industries. Under the influence of this wrong idea, some areas have neglected purchasing and sales work; they have not understood that after the great leap forward in production, product increases and consumption needs increase, and to thoroughly implement the political perspective, production perspective, and mass perspective, it is necessary to first do a good job in "purchase, sale, transfer, storage." That is to say, embody the three major perspectives by doing a good job in circulation. Some commercial cadres in some places have an unclear understanding of how commercial departments should embody the production perspective during the socialist construction period, unilaterally emphasizing running industries and neglecting their own procurement and supply work. This is an important reason why the recent pig procurement situation is not good.

Secondly, after the great leap forward in agricultural production, the production and life patterns of farmers have undergone tremendous changes, but pig procurement work has not been changed accordingly to adapt to this new situation. For example, in the past, when farmers were individual economies, commercial purchasing and sales work was carried out through rural market centers; now that agriculture has been collectivized and rural labor is very tight, agricultural production has been changed to agricultural cooperatives as units, and farmers do not have time to run to market towns, so market towns have undergone great changes, requiring commerce to extend into agricultural cooperatives for purchasing and sales. However, the commercial departments have not readjusted the procurement agencies or changed the procurement methods according to this situation; in addition, the merger of agencies and the transfer of personnel have increased the tasks of grassroots procurement units in some areas, and the strength has not been increased accordingly, so naturally it is far from being able to meet the needs. Furthermore, at present, there are many central tasks in rural areas, often one movement after another, and the commercial departments should have taken the initiative to strive for the leadership of the Party committee, so that procurement work and central work can be combined, but the commercial departments in many areas have not done so, so pig procurement work in many areas has not been included in the work agenda of the local Party committee, which cannot but directly or indirectly affect the development of pig procurement work.

How can we make procurement work adapt to the needs of the objective situation, so as to fundamentally reverse the current unfavorable situation of pig procurement, export and supply? The main thing is that commercial departments should attach importance to purchasing and sales work ideologically. Taking purchasing and sales work as the main task of commercial work, and closely cooperating with industrial and agricultural production through purchasing and sales to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, this is the greatest production perspective. This idea must be clarified in all commercial cadres in order to change the current backward situation of procurement work. In addition, judging from the experience of some areas where the pig procurement task has been completed relatively well, the main organizational measures are as follows:

First of all, the commercial departments must always closely rely on the leadership of the Party committee, report the situation to the Party committee in a timely manner, and listen to instructions. This is the fundamental key to doing a good job in procurement work. Because no matter what kind of work, only by closely relying on the Party committee can there be a clear direction; at the same time, in the great leap forward in agricultural production, the production and lifestyle in rural areas have undergone profound changes, and all work must be uniformly arranged under the leadership of the Party committee, so as to better solve the combination of various tasks with the central work and the necessary labor arrangements. Therefore, the commercial departments must change the past purchasing methods of simply relying on the business system to purchase through the market and waiting for goods to come to the door, and carry out procurement activities under the unified deployment of the Party committee. The pig procurement work in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, was done very well because it implemented this point. The Party committee of this prefecture also arranged and checked the procurement and transfer of pigs and fresh eggs while arranging and checking production work and central work each time, and unified the understanding and actions of Party committees at all levels. Therefore, the purchasing and sales plans of pigs and fresh eggs in Tangshan Prefecture were overfulfilled month by month, the masses were satisfied, and the Party committee was also satisfied. Secondly, closely combine procurement work with rural central work, drive procurement work through central work, and use procurement work to serve central work. At the same time, the procurement plan is specifically arranged to townships and cooperatives through the Party committee, so that the rural grassroots cadres understand the needs of the country and organize sales in a planned way according to the requirements of the country, and turn the country's procurement plan into the masses' sales plan. Anhui Province did it this way. For example, when the central work in rural areas is summer harvest and summer planting, many county finance and trade ministers and commercial bureau directors personally took charge, organized forces to help the masses engage in summer harvest and summer planting, and used their spare time to engage in procurement campaigns. The Party committee and the masses were very satisfied, and the procurement plan was also completed very well. The masses said: "You help us engage in production, and we must help you do a good job in procurement."

Third, widely organize procurement forces and rely on the masses to do a good job in procurement. Pigs come from thousands of households, and the sources of goods are scattered. We must follow the mass line, rely on the strength of the masses to do a good job in procurement, and it is impossible to do well by simply relying on professional institutions and a few professionals. In order to facilitate relying on the strength of the masses to do a good job in procurement, it is necessary to resolutely reform the procurement methods and simplify the procurement grades and specifications. After Hebei, Anhui and other provinces implemented the methods of day and night procurement, door-to-door procurement, combination of procurement and sales, and combination of regular procurement and sudden procurement, they greatly facilitated the purchasing and sales of the masses, which is beneficial to strengthening procurement and strengthening the relationship between the state and farmers.

Fourth, we must strengthen the allocation work. There are also some areas where the number of pigs procured is not small, but the completion of the transfer plan is poor. Therefore, leading departments at all levels must not only grasp the procurement work, but also grasp the allocation work at the same time.

After many areas promoted the above experience, the procurement situation quickly improved. Therefore, all areas where the procurement situation has not fundamentally improved should absorb the good experience of other places and combine it with the experience of their own areas to carefully promote it, so as to quickly change the passive situation of poor pig procurement, so as to better serve to support construction, support production, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and improve the lives of urban and rural people.

### 生猪收购工作为什么没有做好

　　生猪收购工作为什么没有做好
    当前的市场存在一个问题：生猪生产发展了，收购却不好，因此猪肉的供应不能满足人民生活和出口的需要。
    今年，在农业生产大跃进的形势带动下，全国各地的生猪生产有很大的发展，据农业部统计，到第二季度末，全国养猪数量已达一亿八千四百多万头，较1957年底增加26.4％，超过今年国家计划22.9％。从全国的情况来看，各省（区）、市养猪数量都比去年增加，其中不少是肥猪。那么，不少地区生猪收购不好的原因究竟在哪里？首先，在整风运动中，商业系统在批判生产观点不强的过程中（批评生产观点不强是必要的），曾不适当地批判了“购、销、调、存、赚”，使部分干部产生一种错误的思想，认为商业部门只有办工业才是体现生产观点。在这一错误思想的影响下，有些地区就忽视了购销工作；没有理解在生产大跃进以后，产品增加、消费需要增加，要彻底贯彻政治观点，生产观点，群众观点，就必须首先做好“购、销、调、存”的工作。也就是说从做好流通工作中来体现三大观点。有些地方的商业干部对在社会主义建设时期，商业部门究竟怎样体现生产观点认识不明确，片面强调办工业，忽视了本身的收购和供应工作，这是最近时期生猪收购情况不好的一个重要原因。
    其次是农业生产大跃进以后，农民的生产和生活规律都发生了巨大的变化，生猪收购工作却没有适应这种新形势相应地加以改变。例如，过去当农民是个体经济的时候，商业的购销工作是通过农村的集散市场；现在农业合作化了，农村劳动力又很紧张，农业生产改为以农业社为单位，农民没有时间跑集镇了，集镇发生了很大的变化，要求商业伸入到农业社去进行购销。但是，商业部门没有根据这一情况来重新调整收购机构或改变收购方法；加以机构合并，人员调动，部分地区的基层收购单位任务加重，力量未能相应增加，这样自然就远远不能适应需要。再如，目前农村中心任务很多，经常是一个运动接着一个运动，商业部门本来应该主动争取党委的领导，使收购工作和中心工作结合起来进行，但很多地区的商业部门没有这样做，因此生猪收购工作在很多地区未能列入当地党委的工作日程，这就不能不直接或间接地影响生猪收购工作的开展。
    怎样才能使收购工作适应客观形势的需要，从而根本扭转当前生猪收购，出口和供应情况不好的局面呢？主要的是商业部门应该从思想上重视起购销工作。把购销工作作为商业工作的主要任务，通过购销同工农业生产密切协作好，以促进工农业生产的发展，这就是最大的生产观点。这一思想要在全体商业干部中明确起来，才能转变当前收购工作的落后状况。此外从生猪收购任务完成得较好的一些地区的经验来看，在组织措施方面主要的有以下四条：
    首先，商业部门必须时刻紧密的依靠党委的领导，及时向党委汇报情况，听取指示，这是做好收购工作的根本关键。因为无论任何工作，只有紧密依靠党委才能有明确的方向；同时，在农业生产大跃进中，农村的生产和生活方式已发生了深刻的变化，一切工作都必须在党委的领导下统一安排，才能更好地解决各项工作同中心工作的结合和必要的劳动力的安排等问题。因此，商业部门必须改变过去单纯依靠业务系统通过市场采购和等货上门的收购办法，在党委的统一布置下进行收购活动。河北省唐山专区的生猪收购工作就是因为实行了这一条，所以事情办得很好。这个专区的党委在每次布置和检查生产工作和中心工作的同时，也把生猪、鲜蛋的收购和外调进行了布置和检查，并且统一了各级党委的认识与行动，所以唐山专区的生猪、鲜蛋的购销计划月月超额完成，群众满意，党委也满意。其次，把收购工作同农村中心工作紧密结合起来，通过中心工作来带动收购工作，利用收购工作去为中心工作服务。同时，把收购计划通过党委具体布置到乡、社，使农村基层干部了解国家的需要并按照国家的要求有计划地组织出售，把国家的收购计划变为群众的出售计划。安徽省就是这样做的。比如当农村的中心工作是夏收夏种的时候，许多县的财贸部长、商业局长亲自挂帅，组织力量，一面协助群众搞夏收夏种，一面利用空闲时间搞收购运动，党委和群众都很满意，收购计划也完成的很好。群众说：“你们协助我们搞生产，我们一定要协助你们搞好收购”。
    第三，广泛组织收购力量，依靠群众力量来做好收购工作。生猪来自千家万户，货源分散，必须走群众路线，依靠群众的力量才能做好收购，单纯靠专业机构和少数专业人员是做不好的。为了便于依靠群众的力量做好收购工作，就必须坚决改革收购方法，简化收购等级规格。河北、安徽等省实行了日夜收购、上门收购、收购同销售相结合、经常收购和突击收购相结合的办法以后，大大便利了群众的购、销，对加强收购、密切国家同农民的关系都有好处。
    第四，必须加强调拨工作。也有些地区生猪收购数量并不少，但是完成调出计划却差。因此，各级领导部门不仅要抓收购工作，还要同时抓调拨工作。
    不少地区在推广了上述经验以后，收购情况就迅速好转。因此，凡是收购情况尚未根本好转的地区，都应该吸收外地的好经验并结合本地区的经验认真加以推广，以便迅速改变生猪收购不好的被动局面，从而更好地为支援建设、支持生产、巩固工农联盟和改善城乡人民生活服务。
