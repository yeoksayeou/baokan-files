Good Method for Storing Potato Crops in Northern Mountainous Areas
Establishing Double-Cylinder Multi-Chamber Improved Potato Cellars

I have read "New Questions Waiting to be Answered" published on the second page of the People's Daily on July 10th, and I express my enthusiastic support for this column. Now, based on the Pingquan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's decision to promote the "Double-Cylinder Multi-Chamber Improved Potato Cellar" and the Double-Cylinder Multi-Chamber Improved Potato Cellar created by the Pingquan County Farm, I will introduce a good method for storing potato crops to this column.

The Double-Cylinder Multi-Chamber Improved Potato Cellar was created by the Pingquan County Farm in Hebei. The Pingquan County Farm has always grown a large amount of sweet potatoes every year. In the past, they used single-cylinder pit cellars for storage. However, every year a portion of the sweet potatoes would rot, and the storage time was also relatively short. Comrade Liu Yan (a Party member), the farm director, led other personnel in conducting repeated research on storing sweet potatoes. They discovered that beehives for protecting bees to safely overwinter had two air vents, one high exhaust vent and one low intake vent. Based on this principle, they believed that the ventilation effect of double pit cylinders must be good. Therefore, they boldly started developing double-cylinder multi-chamber improved potato cellars. The specific method is: dig two pit cylinders at intervals of three to four *zhang* (approximately 10-13 meters), the upper diameter of the cylinder is 2.5 *chi* (approximately 0.83 meters), and the lower diameter is about 3 *chi* (approximately 1 meter); the passageway is 2.5 *chi* wide and 5.5 *chi* high, storage chambers are dug alternately on both sides of the passageway every four to five *chi* away, the size of the chamber is 5 *chi* wide, 5 to 6 *chi* high, and 8 to 10 *chi* long, the chamber opening is 5 *chi* high and 2 *chi* wide, and the wall is 3 *chi* thick.

Two years of experience have proven that storing potatoes in this type of potato cellar not only protects them from freezing and heat damage, but also prevents infection from soft rot and black spot diseases. From the time they are put into the cellar in autumn until June of the following year, the fresh potatoes are like new when they are taken out. Even the broken potatoes that are bumped or hoed, have cuts that look like they were just dug out of the ground, without any rot. This farm started using this type of cellar to store large quantities of potatoes in 1956, and no rotten potatoes have been found for years.

Using double-cylinder multi-chamber improved potato cellars to store potato crops can regulate the temperature. No matter how the outside temperature changes, it can ventilate to dissipate heat and retain warmth. People can also go inside at any time to check and observe the temperature and humidity. If the temperature is found to be high, the cylinder opening can be opened to dissipate heat; if the temperature is low, coverings can be added; if the humidity is high, the air can be changed.

This year, more than 2,000 people from the three provinces of Shanxi, Henan, and Liaoning and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and more than 5,000 people from all special districts in Hebei Province have visited the Pingquan Farm to learn. In order to adapt to the new situation of planting a large number of potatoes this year, the Pingquan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a decision to uniformly use this method of storing potatoes throughout the county. This type of potato cellar is most suitable for the colder mountainous areas of the north, and is not very suitable for the south and lower-lying plains.

### 北方山区贮藏薯类好办法　建立双筒多室式改良薯窖

专栏：

　　北方山区贮藏薯类好办法
　　建立双筒多室式改良薯窖
    我看了7月10日人民日报第二版登载的“新的题目等着回答”，表示热烈支持这一栏。现在我根据中共平泉县委关于推广“双筒多室式改良薯窖”的决定和平泉县农场创造的双筒多室式改良薯窖，给这一栏介绍一下贮存薯类的好办法。
    双筒多室式改良薯窖是河北平泉县农场创造的。平泉县农场历年都种植大量甘薯。以前他们是挖单筒阱窖贮。但是每年总有一部甘薯霉烂，而且保存的时间也较短。场长刘宴同志（党员）领导其他人员对贮藏甘薯反复进行了研究。他们发现保护蜜蜂安全越冬的蜂窖有两个气孔，一个是高排气孔，一个是低吸气孔。根据这一原理，他们认为双阱筒通风效果一定良好。因此他们就大胆搞起了双筒多室式改良薯窖。具体作法是：在间隔三至四丈的地方挖两个阱筒，筒的上口径为二点五尺，下口径三尺左右；通道宽二点五尺，高五点五尺，通道两旁每隔四至五尺远交错挖贮藏室，室的大小五尺宽，五至六尺高，八至十尺长，室口高五尺、宽二尺，壁厚三尺。
    二年来的经验证明：用这种薯窖贮薯，不但不受冻，不伤热，并且能防止软腐病和黑斑病的感染。从秋天入窖一直到翌年六月，出阱时鲜薯如新，就是碰伤，镐伤的破口薯，也像刚从地里挖出的破纹一样，丝毫没有腐烂。这个农场从1956年开始用这种窖大量贮薯，连年没有发现一块烂薯。
    用双筒多室式改良薯窖贮存薯类，能调节气温，无论外面气温怎样变化，都可以通气散温、保温。人也可以随时去里面检查，观测温度和湿度，发现温度高可以打开阱口散温，温度低可以加复盖物，湿度大可以换气。
    今年，已有山西、河南、辽宁三个省、内蒙古自治区两千多人和河北省所有的专区五千多人到平泉农场参观学习。为了适应今年大量种薯的新形势，中共平泉县委已发布决定在全县范围内一律使用这种办法贮薯。这种薯窖最适宜于北方气候较冷的山区，南方和较低洼的平川不大适合。　宏星（附图片）
