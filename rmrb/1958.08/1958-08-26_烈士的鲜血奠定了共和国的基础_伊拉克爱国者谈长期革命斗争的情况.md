　　The Blood of Martyrs Laid the Foundation for the Republic
　　——An Iraqi Patriot Talks About the Long-Term Revolutionary Struggle

　　The Iraqi revolution was not, as some people imagine, a miracle completed overnight; it was the result of the Iraqi people’s long and arduous struggle.

　　This was emphasized by textile worker Falah recently at a rally welcoming representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions visiting Iraq. Falah, who was recently released from prison after ten years behind bars, spoke of the Iraqi people's struggles in 1920, 1935, 1948, 1952, and 1956. He said that Iraqi workers have always been at the forefront of these struggles.

　　Falah detailed the heroic struggle launched by oil workers against the Iraqi Petroleum Company in Kirkuk in 1948 and the large-scale anti-imperialist strike carried out by workers at the British military base in Habbaniyah. Falah emphasized that thousands of Iraqi workers were killed in these struggles, and it was the blood of these martyrs that laid the foundation for the Republic.

　　On many occasions, I met many workers who actively participated in these labor movements, most of whom had just been released from prison. They told me that under the old regime, almost all trade union organizations were prohibited. In particular, oil workers and railway workers, who stood at the forefront of the workers' struggle, were prohibited from having any organizations of their own. Nevertheless, the workers managed to organize themselves secretly, and the struggle never ceased.

　　A sewing worker who had been imprisoned seven times since 1941 showed me the scars on his chest and legs that had been inflicted by Sayyid's secret agents. He said firmly: "In those days, although 42,000 secret agents were following us, our struggle never stopped for a moment."

　　The role of Iraqi students in these struggles cannot be ignored. A student leader told me that Nuri al-Said feared the students' patriotic sentiments, and he ordered schools to be as far apart as possible to prevent students from holding any gatherings. All student unions were prohibited. The student leader said that even under such circumstances, nearly 80% of the students in Baghdad still secretly participated in student unions.

　　Butti, the editor-in-chief of Baghdad's oldest newspaper, "Al-Bilad" (The Nation), told me about how upright journalists participated in the struggle against the old regime. From the time it published its first newspaper in 1929 until the revolution, "Al-Bilad" was ordered to cease publication by the government forty-five times in twenty-nine years. Butti said, "Every time we were ordered to cease publication, we considered it an honor."

　　The high level of awareness of the Iraqi people is most clearly manifested in their understanding that their struggle is part of the worldwide anti-imperialist struggle led by the socialist countries. A Lieutenant Colonel named Sud once shook my hand tightly and said, "We will always remember that your victory over the imperialists in Korea made it possible for us to achieve victory."

　　烈士的鲜血奠定了共和国的基础
　　——伊拉克爱国者谈长期革命斗争的情况
　　新华社记者　言彪
    伊拉克革命并不是像某些人所想像的在一夜之间完成的奇迹，它是伊拉克人民长期艰苦斗争的结果。
    这是纺织工人费拉赫最近在欢迎访问伊拉克的世界工会联合会代表的集会上讲话时所着重说明的。费拉赫在经过了十年的狱中生活后最近才出狱，他谈到了在1920年、1935年、1948年、1952年和1956年伊拉克人民的斗争。他说，伊拉克工人始终站在这些斗争的最前列。
    费拉赫详细叙述了1948年石油工人在基尔库克对伊拉克石油公司所展开的英雄斗争和工人们在英国的军事基地哈巴尼雅所进行的大规模反帝罢工。费拉赫强调指出，千百名伊拉克工人在这些斗争中被杀害了，就是这些烈士的鲜血奠定了共和国的基础。
    我在好些场合遇到了许多积极参加这些工人运动的工人，他们大都刚从狱中出来。他们告诉我，在旧政权时代，差不多一切工会组织都是被禁止的。尤其禁止站在工人斗争的最前列的石油工人和铁路工人有任何他们自己的组织。尽管如此，工人们还是设法把他们自己秘密地组织起来，斗争从来没有停止过。
    一位从1941年以来曾经七次入狱的缝纫工人让我看了他的胸部和腿部被赛义德的特务人员打伤的伤痕，他坚定地说：“在那些日子里，虽然有四万二千名的秘密特务跟踪着我们，但是我们的斗争一刻也没有停止过。”
    伊拉克学生在这些斗争中的作用也是不能忽视的。一位学生领袖告诉我说，努里·赛义德害怕学生的爱国情绪，他命令学校与学校之间尽可能相隔得远一些，以防止学生举行任何集会。一切学生联合会都是禁止的。这位学生领袖说，即使在这样的情况下，巴格达将近80％的学生仍然秘密地参加了学生联合会。
    巴格达最老的报纸“国家报”的总编辑布蒂跟我谈起了正直的新闻记者怎样参加了反对旧政权的斗争。从1929年出版第一张报纸的时候起到革命时为止，“国家报”在二十九年内被政府勒令停刊四十五次。布蒂说，“当每一次我们被勒令停刊的时候，我们认为这是对我们的一种荣誉。”
    伊拉克人民的高度觉悟最明显地表现在他们的这种认识上：他们的斗争是以社会主义国家为首的全世界反帝国主义斗争的一部分。一位名叫苏德的中校曾经紧握着我的手说，“我们将永远记住，你们在朝鲜对帝国主义者所取得的胜利使我们有可能取得胜利”。　（巴格达24日电）（附图片）
