Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 9th: Pyongyang newspapers today published editorials demanding that the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session stop the US-UK aggression against the Near and Middle East.

	"Rodong Sinmun" said in an editorial today entitled "The United Nations Must Make the US-UK Aggressor Troops Withdraw from the Near and Middle East Immediately" that making the US-UK aggressor troops withdraw from the Near and Middle East immediately is the most important obligation that the United Nations cannot evade.

	The editorial pointed out that this United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session should clearly distinguish who is the fierce aggressor and his running dog, and who is the true defender of peace. The United Nations should not repeat the shameful mistakes made during the Korean War.

	The editorial said that no matter how hard the US imperialists try to use conspiracies, they cannot hide their piratical aggression against the Near and Middle East. Representatives of some member states of the United Nations who have succumbed to the aggressive policies of US imperialism in the past must consider the unanimous anger, protests, and condemnation of the people of the world against the US and British imperialists' acts of playing with fire in the Near and Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 8th: Many Indian newspapers today strongly condemned the United States' bad attitude on August 7th in the United Nations Security Council emergency meeting regarding the convening of a United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting, and demanded that the US-UK aggressor troops withdraw from West Asia.

	The "Hindustan Times" accused the United States of refusing to accept the demand to withdraw its troops from West Asia. The newspaper pointed out: "The withdrawal of Western troops must inevitably become the starting point for resolving the West Asia issue."

	The "Hindustan Times" also said that the US proposal to use UN forces to replace US forces would not help solve the problem.

	The Hindi "New India Times" condemned the United States for still "creating difficulties" in convening the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting at the August 7th Security Council emergency meeting. The newspaper hoped: "The United Nations General Assembly meeting will be able to provide impetus for the essential high-level meeting to discuss the West Asia issue."

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, August 8th: Yangon newspapers today continued to condemn the United States and Britain's aggressive activities in the Middle East, and firmly demanded that the US and British aggressor troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan.

	The "Mirror Daily" pointed out in its editorial: "In fact, the (upcoming United Nations emergency) General Assembly should order the withdrawal of British and American troops from West Asia." The newspaper pointed out that it is very strange that the United States is still constantly transporting troops to Lebanon.

	The "Mirror Daily" emphasized that the United States and Britain should immediately stop their aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. If the United States and Britain continue to aggress, thereby further exacerbating the situation there, the responsibility will fall entirely on the governments of the United States and Britain.

	The "Myanmar New Light Daily" pointed out that the people of the world oppose the US military's occupation of Lebanon.

	The "Yangon Daily" said that the main source of all the chaos in the Middle East region is the Eisenhower Doctrine, and the United States is trying to dominate these oil-producing countries through this doctrine. The newspaper also called on the United States and Britain to sincerely resolve the imminent Middle East problem.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, August 8th: Six Pakistani political leaders jointly sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold on August 8, requesting the United Nations to take action to withdraw the US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

	The telegram said that the delay in the withdrawal of British and American troops from Jordan and Lebanon has caused unease among the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of Pakistan. The telegram pointed out that there is no reason for the US military to remain in Lebanon.

	The six political leaders are: National People's Party General Secretary Usmani, Pakistan Sage Council Chairman Grand Mullah Badayuni, Karachi Republican Party Chairman Abdullah Khan, Pakistan Constitutional Party Chairman Grand Mullah Qadri, former Pakistan Representative to the United Nations Ahsin, and Muslim League's Wu.

    促使侵略者撤军是恢复中东和平的关键
    各国舆论要求联大真正负起制止侵略保卫和平的责任
    新华社平壤9日电　平壤各报今天发表社论，要求联合国大会紧急特别会议制止美英对中近东的侵略。
    “劳动新闻”今天在题为“联合国必须使美英侵略军立即撤出中近东”的社论中说，使美英侵略军立即撤出中近东是联合国不可回避的最重大的义务。
    社论指出，这次联合国大会紧急特别会议应该明确分辨谁是凶恶的侵略者和他的走狗，谁是真正的和平拥护者，联合国不应当重犯朝鲜战争时所犯的那样可耻的错误。
    社论说，尽管美帝国主义者用尽阴谋诡计，也不能掩盖他们对中近东的强盗般的侵略行为。过去屈从美帝国主义侵略政策的联合国部分成员国的代表必须要考虑全世界人民对美英帝国主义者在中近东的玩火行为一致表示的愤怒、抗议和斥责。
    新华社新德里8日电　印度许多报纸今天强烈谴责美国7日在联合国安全理事会紧急会议上在召开联合国大会紧急会议的问题上所表现的恶劣态度，并且要求美英侵略军撤出西亚。
    “印度斯坦时报”指责美国拒绝接受把它的军队撤出西亚的要求。这家报纸指出：“西方军队的撤退必不可免地要成为解决西亚问题的起点”。
    “印度斯坦时报”还说，像美国所提出的要用联合国部队来代替美国部队的方案是无助于解决问题的。
    “印度斯坦旗报”在新闻评论中说：“印度肯定将反对任何关于派遣联合国部队的建议。”
    印地文“新印度时报”谴责美国在7日的安全理事会紧急会议上仍然在召开联合国大会紧急会议上“制造困难”。这家报纸希望：“联合国大会会议将能够为讨论西亚问题的必不可少的最高级会议提供动力”。
    新华社仰光8日电　仰光报纸今天继续谴责美国和英国在中东的侵略活动，并且坚决要求美国和英国的侵略军队立即滚出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    “镜报”在社论中指出：“事实上应该由（即将举行的联合国紧急）大会下令叫英美军队撤出西亚。”报纸指出，直到目前美国还在继续不断地运军队到达黎巴嫩，这是很令人感到奇怪的事情。
    “镜报”着重指出，美国和英国应该立即停止它们对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略。如果美英继续侵略，从而使那里的局势进一步紧张，那么责任将完全由美英两国政府承担。
    “缅甸新光报”指出，全世界人民都反对美国军队侵占黎巴嫩。
    “仰光日报”说，造成中东地区一切混乱的主要根源是艾森豪威尔主义，美国企图通过这项主义独霸这些出产石油的国家。这家报纸还要求美国和英国诚心诚意地解决一触即发的中东问题。
    新华社卡拉奇8日电　巴基斯坦的六位政界领袖在8日联名打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求联合国采取行动使美英两国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    电报说，英美军队迟迟不撤出约旦和黎巴嫩，引起了巴基斯坦爱好和平和自由的人民的不安。电报指出，美国军队没有任何理由留在黎巴嫩。
    这六位政界领袖是：民族人民党总书记乌斯马尼、巴基斯坦贤哲会主席大毛拉巴达尤尼、卡拉奇共和党主席阿卜杜拉汗、巴基斯坦立宪党主席大毛拉卡德里、前任巴基斯坦驻联合国代表阿赫辛和穆斯林联盟的吴·穆罕默德。
