　　Beijing—Moscow
　　Liu Baiyu
　　Still in Beijing in the morning, already in Moscow in the afternoon. The speed of flight has turned mythology into reality, we are like a rainbow, skimming across the high sky. The dawn in Beijing, after a night of thunderstorms, everything is so fresh, what a lovely mature season! The air is full of the sweet smell of crops. When we drove to the airport, Beijing was not completely awake yet, the sky was a dark blue, and a small patch of red glow had just emerged in the east. The glass windows of the factories were still flashing with blue lights, and a small team of female members of the agricultural cooperative were walking and laughing on the path beside the field. Before these memories could be savored properly, in the blink of an eye, looking out the window, the sky was clear for thousands of miles, and a brilliant sunshine was caressing the myriad white clouds below us. From the gaps in the white clouds, we saw the verdant mountains, and the Great Wall was like a thin white line. The plane sang and flew lightly. Soon after, we saw the blue Lake Baikal, and after a while, the Ertis River, full of ships, came into view. Irkutsk was as cool as autumn, but the airport runway in Omsk slept like a piece of white gold that was both hot and shiny.
　　Time and speed are not minor issues, they are carrying the hopes of mankind forward. Construction and destruction, flying and stagnation, are precisely the clear contrast between the rapidly advancing socialist camp and the aging and collapsing imperialist camp. People all over the world are watching this decisive battle of peaceful competition with wide eyes and full of passion. We know that what guarantees our victorious advance is the unity and friendship of the socialist brotherly countries, especially China and the Soviet Union. Recently, when the dark clouds of the Near East war brought new threats to the people, the communique of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev further promoted this unity and friendship and strengthened the forces defending peace. It issued a new call for a great leap forward to the world, to Asia, to Africa, and to the people of Latin America. This communique is a great charter in the history of human development, it is so exciting. In the morning, I heard the voices of Beijing people cheering for it, and in the afternoon, I saw the happy smiles of Moscow people for it.
　　The economies of socialist countries are booming. In our country, the great leap forward in production is rising like a rocket. Iron and steel smelting are scattered all over the country like stars. If you could overlook it from the sky, you could not help but be surprised by this wonderful and magnificent night scene. Look! Red sparks are spraying all over the ground, and the whole earth is like a festive sky full of fireworks. Golden grains are always a symbol of wealth and happiness. People cultivate them with sweat and greet them with smiles, and this year they are simply flying out of the soil, creating the world's highest yield records of more than 7,000 catties per mu for wheat and more than 30,000 catties per mu for rice. People use "satellites" to describe and call for these new records, but the source of people's energy continues to burst out, radiating more and more amazing miracles from the hands of farmers.
　　However, in this summer, the United States and British empires invaded Lebanon and Jordan, igniting the flames of aggression. The righteous roar of the people all over the world resounded. Our hands are still stained with the fragrance of newly harvested wheat grains, and we are plunged into this thrilling torrent of struggle. In the hot summer days and nights in Beijing, our protesting ranks surged towards the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires from all directions like a sea tide. It has already become a forest of anger: the walls, the doorways, the electric wires, the branches, and the sidewalks are all covered with slogans and cartoons. The slogans are added layer upon layer, and the entire courtyard wall and gate of the Office of the Chargé d'Affaires are like wearing a thick coir raincoat. Each of these slogans is a ray of justice. People gathered there densely, waving their fists and shouting; at night, they held high flaming torches. I saw that the faces of the young people were full of such lofty passion, this is a truly standing up generation, whoever dares to invade him will be annihilated by him! In those propaganda paintings, the Arab warriors wearing white scarves have become the beloved heroes in our hearts. That heavy chain was smashed, and the Baghdad Pact without Baghdad has only become a cruel mockery of history.
　　The communique of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev issued a loud, alarm-like voice: "The colonial era is gone forever!" "If imperialist warmongers dare to impose war on the people of the world," then we will "completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors and lay the foundation for lasting peace in the world."
　　This communique is a reflection of the voices of the people of socialist countries, especially China and the Soviet Union. Just as a farmer in Beijing said: "If the imperialists dare to provoke a war, I will respond to the call of the motherland at any time, put down my hoe, and pick up my gun." A Moscow worker told me: "Great, I am completely satisfied with this communique, everything for peace." He put his clenched fist on the table and told about the demonstration of the working people of Moscow going to the US Embassy. This shows that the hearts of the Chinese and Soviet people are closely linked together.
　　Friendship and unity are like steel, the more they are tempered by fire, the more pure and solid they become. This kind of friendship and unity is expressed in courage in battle and in creation in construction. Now, our socialist creations are blooming in a riot of color. If the air route from Beijing to Moscow is like a rainbow, it is a road full of flowers of peace and happiness, it is a road of rapid progress in peaceful competition.
　　The afternoon in Moscow is so cool. When we drove from the airport to the city, the construction of a new urban area dazzled me. Although I had been here a year ago, as the poet Surkov said to me not long ago: "When you go again, you will not recognize Moscow!" Indeed, those huge buildings are like a forest, or a group of high mountains, flying in from somewhere. Construction is underway, the arms of the steel giant, the crane, are moving, and on the roof high in the sky, a worker is waving a small red flag. This reminds me of the avenue at the east end of our newly opened East Chang'an Street, where the lighting is bright all night, and the bulldozers are constantly roaring. All this, Beijing's and Moscow's, immediately formed a picture in my mind of building a peaceful and beautiful world, and it is such enthusiastic workers who are standing at the forefront of the people's ranks, defending world peace. We drove quickly down Lenin Hills, at this time the setting sun illuminated the entire Moscow, the Moscow River was like a piece of blue crystal stone, and the golden dome of the Kremlin was as brilliant as the sun.

### 北京—莫斯科

　　北京—莫斯科
　　刘白羽
    早晨还在北京，下午已到莫斯科。飞行的速度，已经把神话变成现实，我们像一道彩虹，掠过了高空。北京的黎明，一夜雷雨刚刚过去，一切都那样清新，多么可爱的成熟的季节呀！空气里都含有庄稼的甜味。当我们向机场驶行时，北京还未完全醒过来，天空一片墨蓝，东方刚浮起一小片红霞。工厂的玻璃窗上还闪着蓝色灯光，田边小径上已经有一小队农业社女社员嘻笑着走过，这些记忆还没来得及好好地回味，转眼之间，向窗外一看，长空万里，一片灿烂的阳光正抚摸着我们下面那万朵白云，从白云隙缝里看到碧绿的丛山，长城像一根细细的白线。飞机轻快地歌唱着、飞翔着。不久之后，我们看到蓝色的贝加尔湖，过些时候，浮满船舶的额尔齐斯河已映入眼帘。伊尔库次克像秋天一样清凉，鄂木斯克的飞机跑道却睡得像一片又烫又亮的白金片。
    时间与速度，不是次要的问题，它正载着人类的希望前进。建设与破坏，飞翔与停滞，正是突飞猛进的社会主义阵营与老朽崩溃的帝国主义阵营之间，鲜明的对照，全世界人民张大了眼睛，满怀着激情，在看着这一场和平竞赛的决战。我们知道，保证着我们胜利前进的，是社会主义兄弟国家，特别是中国与苏联的团结与友谊。最近，当中近东战争的乌云给人民带来新的威胁，毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报，就更进一步促进了这种团结与友谊，加强了保卫和平的力量，它向全世界，向亚洲、向非洲、向拉丁美洲人民发出了新的跃进的号召。这个公报是人类发展史上伟大的宪章，它是那样激动着人心，早晨我听到北京人为它而欢腾的心声，下午我看到莫斯科人为它而喜悦的笑容。
    社会主义国家经济蓬勃发展着。在我们国家里，生产大跃进像火箭一样上升。炼铁炼钢，在全国各地星罗棋布，如果你能从天空俯瞰一下，你不能不为这美妙的、壮丽的夜景而惊奇。你看！通红的火花遍地喷射，整个大地就如同布满焰火的节日的天空。金黄色的谷粒永远是富裕与幸福的象征。人们拿汗水培养它，用笑容迎接它，而今年它们简直是在从土壤里飞翔，创造了麦子亩产七千多斤，稻子亩产三万多斤的世界最高丰产纪录，人们用“卫星”来形容，呼唤这些新的纪录，但是，人民精力的源泉不停地迸发，从农民的双手下面，放射出一个比一个更惊人的奇迹。
    但是，就在这个夏天，美、英帝国侵入黎巴嫩、约旦、燃起了侵略的火焰。全世界人民正义的吼声震响起来。我们的手上还染着新收获的麦粒的芳香，又涌进这一惊心动魄的斗争激流。炎热的北京夏昼和深夜，我们的抗议的行列从四面八方，像海潮一样涌向英国代办处。那儿已经成为一座愤怒的森林：墙壁上、门口、电线上、树枝头、行人道上都贴满标语和漫画，标语一层一层加上去，整个代办处的院墙及大门，就像披了一件厚厚的蓑衣一样，这每一条标语都是一道正义的光芒。人们密密层层聚集在那里，晃着拳头，呼喊着；夜间，高举着熊熊的火炬。我看见那一个青年的面孔，都充满那样崇高的激情，这是真正站起来的一代，谁要敢侵犯他，谁就会被他歼灭！在那一幅幅宣传画上，戴着白色披巾的阿拉伯勇士，成为我们心中敬爱的英雄。那一条沉重的锁链被砸断了，没有巴格达的巴格达条约，只成为严酷的历史的嘲笑。
    毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报发出了警钟般宏亮的声音：“殖民主义时代已经一去不复返了！”“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上”那么，我们就要“彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”
    这公报正是社会主义国家、特别是中苏两国人民心声的反映。正像北京一个农民说：“如果帝国主义胆敢挑起战争，我将随时响应祖国的号召，放下锄头，拿起枪杆。”一个莫斯科工人告诉我：“好极了，我对这个公报完全满意，一切为了和平。”他把握紧的拳头搁在桌面上，讲述着莫斯科劳动人民到美国大使馆门前去的示威游行。这说明：中苏人民的心是紧密结合在一起的。
    友谊、团结、像钢一样，愈经过火炼就愈益纯固。这种友谊、团结，表现在战斗中是勇敢，表现在建设中是创造。现在，我们社会主义的创造，万紫千红，竞相开放。如果说从北京到莫斯科的航线像一道彩虹，它就是开满和平与幸福花朵的道路，它就是和平竞赛中突飞猛进的道路。
    莫斯科的下午如此凉爽。当我们从飞机场驶进市区时，一片新市区的建筑，使我眼花缭乱，虽然一年前我还来过，但正如诗人苏尔科夫不久以前对我所说：“再去的时候，你会不认识莫斯科了！”真的，那一片片一幢幢巨大楼房就像一片森林，或者一群高山，从什么地方飞来。建筑正在进行，起重机这个钢铁巨人的手臂移动着，高在天边的屋顶上，一个工人摆着一面小红旗。这使我联想到我们新开辟的东长安街东头的大道，照明灯通宵雪亮，推土机在不停的轰响。这一切，北京的，莫斯科的，在我脑海中立刻联成一幅建设和平、美好世界的画图，而正是这样的热情的劳动者站在人民行列的最前哨，在捍卫着世界的和平。我们飞快地驶下列宁山，这时斜阳照明整个莫斯科，莫斯科河像一片蓝色水晶石，克里姆林宫的金顶像太阳一样辉煌。
