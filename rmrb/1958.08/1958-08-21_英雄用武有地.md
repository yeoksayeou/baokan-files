　　Heroes Have a Place to Use Their Talents
　　Wang Pu
　　Since the Party put forward slogans such as "the whole people run the iron and steel industry," "the whole people smelt copper," and "the whole people smelt aluminum," the people in the mountainous areas feel that there are not enough people. Seeing the treasures sleeping underground cannot be quickly developed, and seeing that the needs of the country cannot be met, they feel anxious. Residents in the plains and large cities suffer from a lack of resources or not enough resources. Seeing others fighting hard for ten days and a half months, dozens or hundreds of small blast furnaces and small converters rising from the ground, and molten steel and iron reflecting half the sky in red, their hearts are itchy, their hands are itchy, and they feel like heroes have no place to use their talents.
    However, is this contradiction insurmountable? No. Where there is contradiction, there must be a way to overcome the contradiction. Not long ago, the people of Nantong, Jiangsu, carrying their luggage, crossed the Yangtze River to engage in "flying mining" in the mountainous area of Zhenjiang, which solved this contradiction. Now, the people of Xuchang Special District in Henan Province and Baoding, Handan, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou and other special districts in Hebei Province have also found ways to overcome the contradiction. That is, residents in the plains organize expeditionary forces to go to the mountains to engage in the iron and steel industry and the coal industry, etc. People in the plains have a place to use their talents, the resources in the mountains have been developed, and the economy in the mountains has been prospered at an early date. Henan and Hebei can do this, and other provinces and cities can do this; the iron and steel industry and the coal industry can do this, and non-ferrous metals and other industries can also do this. In the old days, the situation of "heroes having no place to use their talents" often occurred, but today's China will not have such a thing.
    Now is an era when heroes are needed everywhere. Cities and villages, plains and mountains, coastal and inland, south and north, sky and earth, on water and on land, all walks of life in industry, agriculture, military, education, and commerce are doing things that predecessors have not done, and taking roads that predecessors have not taken. Which place does not need heroes to use their talents? However, the place to use one's talents is not always placed in front of you, but requires heroes to use their brains to find it. It can be said that in our country, we are only afraid that you do not have the heroic ambition to serve the people and charge for the socialist cause, and we are never afraid of not finding a place to use your talents.
    For all the people who are worried about the lack of resources, summon up your lofty aspirations, like the people of Nantong, Jiangsu, and like the residents of the plains in Henan and Hebei, organize expeditionary forces to go to the mountains, to places with resources, and vigorously develop the iron and steel industry, the non-ferrous metal industry, and other industries! The Party and the government will support you, and the people in the mountains will welcome you!

　　英雄用武有地
　　王朴
    党提出“全民办钢铁工业”、“全民炼铜”、“全民炼铝”等口号以后，山区人民感到人手不够，眼看着沉睡地下的宝藏不能很快开发，眼看着国家的需要得不到满足，心里直发急。平原地区和大城市的居民则苦于没有资源或者资源不多，看见人家苦战十天半月，几十座几百座小高炉小转炉平地起，钢水铁水映红半个天，心也痒，手也痒，大有英雄无用武之地的感觉。
    然而，这个矛盾是不能克服的吗？不。有矛盾，必有克服矛盾的办法。不久以前，江苏南通人民背着行装，跨过长江，到镇江山区搞“飞矿”，就解决了这个矛盾。现在河南省许昌专区和河北省保定、邯郸、天津、张家口等专区的人民也找到了克服矛盾的办法，这就是平原地区居民组织远征军到山区去搞钢铁工业和煤炭工业等等。平原地区人民有了用武之地，山区的资源得到了开发，山区的经济得到早日的繁荣。河南河北可以这样办，别的省市也可以这样办；钢铁工业和煤炭工业可以这样办，有色金属及其它工业也可以这样办。在旧时代，“英雄无用武之地”的情况是常常发生的，今天的中国则不会发生这样的事了。
    现在是到处需要英雄用武的时代。城市和乡村，平原和山区，沿海和内地，南方和北方，天上地下，水上陆上，工、农、兵、学、商各行各业，到处都在做着前人所没有做过的事情，走着前人所没有走过的道路，哪一个地方不需要英雄用武？然而用武之地，有时并不是摆在眼前，而需要英雄开动脑筋去找。可以这样说，在我们的国家里，只怕你没有为人民服务、为社会主义事业打冲锋的英雄壮志，绝不怕找不到用武之地。
    一切为着没有资源发愁的人们，鼓起你们凌云的壮志，像江苏南通人民那样，像河南河北平原地区居民那样，组织远征军到山区去，到有资源的地方去，大办钢铁工业、大办有色金属工业及其它工业吧！党和政府会支援你们，山区人民会欢迎你们！
