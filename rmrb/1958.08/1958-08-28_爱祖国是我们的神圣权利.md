　　Loving the Motherland is Our Sacred Right
　　Zhu Shulan
    I am a journalist who studied in Hong Kong more than a decade ago. Recently, the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly persecuted our educational undertakings. On the morning of the 26th, they dispatched armed police to forcibly close the Chung Wah Middle School, expel teachers and students from the school, and beat these teachers and students, as well as news reporters who were present to cover the event. This is truly infuriating.

    It is said that the British authorities in Hong Kong forcibly closed Chung Wah Middle School because the school building was a "dangerous building" and for the safety of teachers and students. However, Chung Wah Middle School submitted a construction plan long ago, but they delayed and ignored it. Can anyone believe that this is truly well-intentioned concern for the safety of teachers and students at Chung Wah Middle School? A few days ago, a news item appeared in the Hong Kong newspapers stating that in the second quarter of this year, 19,679 students from 293 schools underwent physical examinations, of which 3,029 required treatment, 11,090 had minor ailments, and only one-quarter of the total number were completely healthy. This is strange. Since the British authorities in Hong Kong are so concerned about the safety of students, why do they turn a blind eye to such a serious student health problem?

    Obviously, the so-called "dangerous building" is not what the British authorities in Hong Kong are concerned about. The principal of Chung Wah Middle School revealed at a press conference that during the "May 1" International Labor Day this year, they hung the national flag as usual, but on May 5th, they received a letter from the Hong Kong authorities stating that hanging the national flag was a "political and semi-political" event and demanded that the school explain the reason for hanging the flag. Huang Zufen, the principal of Chung Wah Middle School, replied well that hanging the national flag is the patriotic right of the Chinese people. The problem lies here: the British authorities in Hong Kong want to prevent the Chinese people from having the freedom to love their country. The clues are obvious, and the British authorities' persecution of the Chinese people's educational undertakings in Hong Kong has ulterior motives.

    Although more than ten years have passed, I will never forget the days when I studied in Hong Kong during the Anti-Japanese War. When I first arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland to apply to schools, one of the schools shocked me as soon as I entered. I felt as if I had arrived in another country. Although the classmates were all Chinese with yellow skin and black hair like me, the language they spoke was not the familiar language of the motherland, and the content of the textbooks they read was either about the British Empire in this way or that, or some outdated ancient books. There was no trace of the Chinese people's passionate anti-Japanese sentiment. Many young people in this school were poisoned, and their minds were filled with various colonial and feudal ideologies. They lost their national self-esteem, despised their own country, and even regarded Orientals as inferior races, and took pride in imitating Westerners in every move and every word. This is the result of the British authorities in Hong Kong's painstaking efforts in running slave education, which cannot but be infuriating. Today, the Chinese people have stood up like giants. Every Chinese person feels proud of their great motherland. This is the reason why the British authorities in Hong Kong are afraid and persecute these patriotic teachers and students. We support the struggle of the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School in Hong Kong and all other schools that love the motherland to protest against the persecution by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The fact that many students from English schools have joined the ranks of this anti-persecution struggle further shows the bankruptcy of colonial slave education.

    In order to avoid exposing their ugly faces, the British authorities in Hong Kong dared to beat Chinese journalists. This is an act of infringing on freedom of the press and personal freedom. We sincerely express our condolences to the thirteen journalists who have suffered violence. All Chinese journalists support you! We believe that you will not be intimidated by any violence, and we await your victory news.

　　爱祖国是我们的神圣权利
　　朱树兰
    我是一个新闻工作者，十多年前曾经在香港念过书。最近，香港英国当局一再迫害我国教育事业，26日晨竟出动武装警察，强行封闭中华中学，驱逐教师、学生离校，并且殴打这些教师和学生，以及在场采访的新闻记者，真是令人气愤。
    据说，香港英国当局强令封闭中华中学，是为了这所学校的校舍是“危楼”，是为了教师和学生的安全才这样做的。可是，中华中学早就提出了修建计划，他们却拖延不理，难道能使人相信这真是好心关怀中华中学师生的安全吗？前几天，香港的报纸上登载了这样一则消息，今年第二季度内，有二百九十三所学校的一万九千六百七十九名学生进行了体格检查，其中三千零二十九名即需医治，一万一千零九十名有轻微毛病，完全健康的只占总人数的四分之一。这就奇怪了，香港英国当局既然这么关心学生的安全，为什么又对这样严重的学生健康问题，置之不问呢？
    很明显，所谓“危楼”并不是香港英国当局所关心的事。中华中学校长在一次记者招待会上曾经揭露说，今年“五一”国际劳动节，他们照例悬挂了国旗，但在5月5日就接到香港当局的一封来信，说悬挂国旗是“政治性与半政治性”事件，要学校解释挂旗的理由。中华中学校长黄祖芬回复得好，挂国旗是中国人的爱国权利。问题就在这里，香港英国当局就是要阻止中国人民爱国的自由。蛛丝马迹，不言而喻，英国当局迫害香港的中国人民教育事业是有不可告人的目的。
    虽然事隔十多年，但我永远不能忘记抗日战争期间，在香港读书的那些日子。当我刚从内地到香港去投考学校的时候，其中的一所学校，一进门，就把我吓了一跳。我仿佛到了另一个国家，虽然同学们都是和我一样黄皮肤黑头发的中国人，他们说的话却不是我熟习的祖国语言，所读的课本内容不是英帝国如此这般，便是些陈腐古书。在那里嗅不出一点中国人民热火朝天的抗日情绪，这所学校的不少青年受了毒害，满脑子是各种各样的殖民主义封建主义思想，他们丧失了民族自尊心，轻视自己的祖国，甚至把东方人都看成是低等民族，一举一动，一言一语都以摸仿西方人为荣。这就是香港英国当局苦心经营的奴化教育的结果，不能不令人发指。今天，中国人民像巨人一样地站起来了。每一个中国人都为自己伟大的祖国而感到自豪。这便是香港英国当局所害怕，而且要向这些爱国教师和学生进行迫害的原因。我们支持香港中华中学和其他所有热爱祖国的学校师生抗议香港英国当局迫害的斗争。许多英文学校的学生参加到这个反迫害斗争的行列中来，更是显示了殖民主义奴化教育的破产。
    香港英国当局为了害怕把自己的丑恶面貌暴露出来，竟敢殴打中国记者，这是一种侵犯新闻自由和人身自由的行为。我们衷心地向十三位身受暴行的新闻记者表示慰问，全体中国新闻记者支持你们！我们相信，你们不会被任何暴力所吓倒，我们等待着你们胜利的消息。
