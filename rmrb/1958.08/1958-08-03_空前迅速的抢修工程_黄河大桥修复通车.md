    Unprecedentedly Rapid Repair Project
    Yellow River Bridge Reopens to Traffic
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Jiansheng reports: A pier of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, which was destroyed by an extraordinary flood, has been completely repaired. The Yellow River Bridge, which had been interrupted for fifteen days, reopened to traffic today. In the morning, a passenger train from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang safely crossed the bridge as usual. At this time, the workers who repaired the bridge cheered for overcoming the natural barrier of the Yellow River, and the passengers on the train nodded and waved to pay their respects to the workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers who repaired the railway bridge.
    At the celebration meeting held today to celebrate the restoration of the railway bridge, Yu Guangsheng, Vice Minister of Railways, said that under such special hydrological conditions of the Yellow River, it is unprecedented in the history of Chinese railways and rare in the history of world railways to repair a regular pier in such a short period of time during the flood season, with the quality of the project exceeding the original building that was washed away.
    The Zhengzhou Yellow River Railway Bridge was destroyed by a flood of more than 21,000 cubic meters per second on July 17. The foundation depth of the repaired pier is 10 meters deeper than the original pier. The new pier is entirely steel structure, which not only has a large load-bearing capacity, but is also stronger than before and more resistant to flood erosion.
    This repair project was carried out during the flood season of the Yellow River, with rapid water flow, rolling waves, and a flow rate of up to five meters per second. The water depth under the bridge reached fifteen meters. The bridge surface was narrow and there was no foothold. During the repair period, there were often flood peaks of 5,000 to 7,000 cubic meters and gales of level five or six. According to historical records, neither the repair project nor the construction of this bridge has ever been carried out during the flood season of the Yellow River. However, in the face of the Chinese working people under the leadership of the Communist Party, who have a lofty communist spirit, there are no insurmountable difficulties. The builders demonstrated a high degree of creativity, solved key problems such as pile driving in rapid currents, and rapidly completed the repair project during the Yellow River flood season, adding a glorious page to the history of Chinese bridges.
    In the battle to repair the Yellow River Railway Bridge, it demonstrated the power of the whole party and the whole people united as one, invincible and unconquerable. The heroes issued a steely oath: "Stronger will than steel, we will compete with the flood, repair the bridge for transportation, and show our strength to the United States and Britain."
    In the process of repairing the bridge, more than 1,200 first-class heroes emerged.

### 空前迅速的抢修工程  黄河大桥修复通车

    空前迅速的抢修工程
    黄河大桥修复通车
    据新华社郑州2日电　新华社记者刘健生报道：被特大洪水冲毁的京广铁路黄河铁桥的一个桥墩，已经全部修复。中断了十五天的黄河大桥，今天又恢复通车。上午，一列由郑州开往新乡的客车和往常一样，安全地通过了大桥。这时，抢修大桥的职工们为战胜黄河天险而欢呼，列车上的旅客们向修复铁桥的职工们、解放军战士们点头挥手致敬。
    在今天召开的庆祝铁桥修复大会上，铁道部副部长余光生说，在黄河这样特殊的水文条件下，在汛期内以这样短的时间，把正规桥墩修复，工程质量并超过了被冲掉的原有建筑，这在中国铁路史上是空前的，在世界铁路史上也是罕见的。
    郑州黄河铁桥是在7月17日被二万一千多秒公方的洪水冲毁的。这次修复的桥墩基础深度比原来桥墩加深十公尺。新桥墩全部是钢结构，不仅承载量大，而且比以前坚固，更能抵抗洪水的冲刷。
    这次修复工程正处在黄河汛期，水流湍急，波浪滚滚，流速每秒达五公尺。桥下水深达十五公尺。桥面狭窄，又没有立足点。修复期间又常常有五千到七千秒立方的洪峰和五六级大风的袭击。据历史记载，不仅是修复工程而且包括这座大桥修建在内，都没有放在黄河的洪水期间进行施工。但是在共产党领导下的有崇高共产主义风格的中国劳动人民面前，是没有克服不了的困难的。建筑者们发挥了高度的创造性，解决了在急流里打桩等关键问题，在黄河洪水期间迅速的完成修复工程，给中国桥梁史上增加了光荣的一页。
    在抢修黄河铁桥的战斗中，显示了全党全民万众一心，战无不胜攻无不克的威力。英雄们发出了钢铁般的誓言：“意志坚强赛过钢，要与洪水来较量，修成大桥便运输，面向美英示力量。”
    在这次修复桥梁的过程中，共涌现出一千二百多名一等功臣。
