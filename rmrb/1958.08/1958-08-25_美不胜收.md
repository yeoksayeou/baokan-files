　　The First National Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) Performance Convention is a gathering of heroes, a leap forward meeting, and also an unprecedented grand event in the history of Quyi development.

　　In this performance convention, there were 132 modern Quyi pieces, accounting for 79% of all the performance programs; 35 traditional Quyi pieces, accounting for 21%. Most of the modern pieces were produced since last winter, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The works can quickly reflect the new spiritual outlook of the people in the Great Leap Forward, and they closely cooperated with the practical struggles, playing a role in inspiring and educating the people. The revolutionary vigor and heroic deeds reflected in these works will amaze our descendants. There are many good programs, including 5051 (Xihe Dagu), Dragon King Resigns (Xihe Dagu), Lost (Fisher Drum), Emancipation (Shaanxi Storytelling), Socialism is Good (Cross Talk), Not Relying on Heaven (Drum Lyrics), and other fifty-three modern pieces.

　　Traditional pieces include: Li Kui Makes Havoc in Jiangzhou (Cantonese Opera Da Hou), Flying Cloud Ford (Shandong Kuaishu), Boat Meeting (Yangqin), Thinking of Mortality (Cichang), Righteous Accusation (Pingtan), Wu Song Beats the Tiger (Yangzhou Pinghua), Gao Ji Sells Silk (Lotus Flower), Nine-tailed Dog (Zanha), Havoc in Jiangzhou (Jingyun Dagu), Selling the Maid (Sanxian Story). There are good achievements in musical reform in: Singing Hero Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao, Eradicating Illiteracy in the Countryside, 5051, Cuckoo Bird Cuckoos, Overturning Rivers and Seas, etc. Pingtan, Plum Blossom Dagu, Jingyun Dagu and other Quyi types also have innovations in music. Outstanding in performance are: Gao Yuanjun's Shandong Kuaishu "Reconnaissance Soldier," Wang Shaotang's Pinghua "Wu Song Beats the Tiger"...

　　Judging from works such as "5051," "Lost," "Emancipation," "Dragon King Resigns," "Socialism is Good," and "Yu Xiaoyu," the quality of creation is not low and has a certain typicality. The characteristic of these works is the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Many works inherit the progressive romanticism tradition in history and have creative development. We can see this from excellent works such as "Dragon King Resigns" and "Overturning Rivers and Seas." The characteristic of these works is that on the basis of revolutionary realism, they powerfully idealize people's creation of real life and elevate it to revolutionary romanticism, thus making real life appear richer, more solid, and more beautiful. At the same time, these works combine revolutionary romanticism with popular folk stories. From here, we can see that revolutionary romanticism criticizes the harmful parts of traditional romanticism. That is, for thousands of years, the Dragon King has ruled the people's minds and was regarded as the master of fate. Now, this spiritual force has been defeated by the soaring energy of hundreds of millions of working people. These works play a very good educational role of valuing the present and despising the past, and play a role in breaking superstitions and liberating the mind.

　　I very much agree with using revolutionary romanticism to liberate people from the traditional mental state and to criticize the harmful parts of the romanticism in the past traditions. Dragon King, Jade Emperor, and other gods were once miserably defeated by Sun Wukong, and once made the people proud, but they could not finally disappear in the minds of the people. This is because the reality of today has not appeared in history. Only today can the working people really call the wind and rain, turn rivers and seas, and make a big fuss in the Heavenly Palace.

　　The great achievements of this performance convention are first and foremost due to the leadership and help of Party, government, and cultural departments at all levels. Quyi artists have put politics in command, clarified that Quyi should inspire and educate the people, reflect the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Secondly, the artists have transformed their thinking, developed feelings for the new society, can integrate with the working people, love them, go deep into life, and go to the mountains and countryside to participate in labor training. Thirdly, the unique role of Quyi art as a light cavalry and vanguard has been brought into play, singing about the center and talking about the center, closely cooperating with politics and combining with production, serving politics in every possible way.

　　Finally, in terms of art, on the one hand, tradition has been respected and inherited, and on the other hand, tradition has been developed and many new things have been created. Many actors, musicians, and authors are reformers in art. Everyone can fully use excellent traditional art in new programs, and innovate and create to develop into socialist national new Quyi. We must carry forward these achievements well, overcome shortcomings, and achieve greater success in future work.

　　美不胜收
　　刘芝明
    第一届全国曲艺会演大会是群英会，是跃进会，也是曲艺发展史上从来没有过的盛会。
    这次会演现代曲目共一百三十二个，占全部会演节目的79％；传统曲目三十五个，占21％。现代曲目大多是去冬以来，工农业生产大跃进高潮中产生出来的，作品都能迅速地反映大跃进中的人民的新的精神面貌，它们密切地配合现实斗争，起了鼓舞人民、教育人民的作用。这些作品中所反映的革命干劲及英雄事迹，将会使我们的后人感到惊讶。好的节目很多，现代曲目有：五千一（西河大鼓）、龙王辞职（西河大鼓）、迷路记（渔鼓）、翻身记（陕北说书）、社会主义好（相声）、不靠天（鼓词）等五十三个。
    传统曲目有：李逵闹江州（粤曲大喉）、飞云浦（山东快书）、船会（扬琴）、思凡（伬唱）、义责（弹词）、武松打虎（扬州评话）、高机卖绡（莲花）、九尾狗（赞哈）、闹江州（京韵大鼓）、卖丫环（三弦书）。在音乐改革上有很好的成绩的有：歌唱英雄黄继光、罗盛教、扫盲运动到了乡、五千一、布谷鸟儿咕咕叫、翻江倒海等。评弹、梅花大鼓、京韵大鼓等曲种在音乐上也都有革新创造。在表演方面比较突出的有：高元钧的山东快书“侦察兵”、王少堂的评话“武松打虎”……。
    从“五千一”、“迷路记”、“翻身记”、“龙王辞职”、“社会主义好”、“虞小玉”等作品来看，创作质量是不低的，具有一定的典型性。这些作品的特色是革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合。不少作品，把历史上进步的浪漫主义传统继承下来，而且有创造性的发展。我们从“龙王辞职”、“翻江倒海”等优秀作品中就能看到这一点。这些作品的特色，是在革命的现实主义的基础上，有力地把人们对于现实生活的创造加以理想化，提到革命的浪漫主义，因而，显出现实生活更加丰富，更加坚实，更加美丽。同时，这些作品将革命的浪漫主义结合在流行于民间的传统故事里，从这里，可以看到革命的浪漫主义批判了传统的浪漫主义中的有害部分，这就是几千年来的龙王曾经统治人民的头脑，奉为命运的主宰，现在，这种精神势力已被亿万劳动人民的冲天干劲打垮了。这些作品，很起薄古厚今的教育作用，很起破除迷信，解放思想的作用。
    我很赞成用革命的浪漫主义，把人们从传统的精神状态中解放出来，把过去的传统中的浪漫主义的有害部分加以批判。龙王、玉皇大帝等神物，过去曾经被孙悟空打得惨败，曾经使人民扬眉吐气过，但它们不能最后在人民头脑中消亡，这是因为历史上还未出现过今天的现实，只有在今天，劳动人民才真的能够呼风唤雨，排山倒海，大闹天宫。
    这次会演取得这样大的成绩，首先是由于在各级党、政、文化部门的领导与帮助下，曲艺艺人政治挂了帅，明确了曲艺要鼓舞人民、教育人民，反映劳动人民的思想感情，为工农兵服务。其次是艺人们思想上有了改造，对于新社会发生了情感，能和劳动人民打成一片，并且热爱他们，深入生活，上山下乡进行劳动锻炼。再其次是发挥了曲艺艺术独特的轻骑队、尖兵的作用，唱中心说中心，紧密配合政治、结合生产，无孔不入地为政治服务。
    最后是在艺术上一方面尊重、继承了传统，一方面又发展了传统，创造了许多新的东西。很多演员、乐师、作者在艺术上是革新派，大家能够在新曲目中充分运用优秀的传统艺术，并且革新创造，发展成为社会主义的民族新曲艺。我们要好好地发扬这些成绩，克服缺点，在今后工作中获得更大的成就。
