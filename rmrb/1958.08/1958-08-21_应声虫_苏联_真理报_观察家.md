　　Echo Chamber
　　"Pravda" Observer of the Soviet Union
    The meeting between Comrade Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union, and Comrade Mao Zedong, leader of the People's Republic of China, is a major event in the struggle to prevent a new war threatening humanity. All socialist countries, Asian countries, Arab countries, and all peace-loving people unanimously believe that this meeting is a significant contribution to the cause of peace. The warning issued by the two great socialist countries, supported by the people of other countries, has dampened the arrogance of the most reckless militarists and forced them to think deeply. This is the reality, and progressive public opinion around the world recognizes these facts. However, Yugoslavia takes a different attitude towards this historic event.

    On August 4th, just as newspapers around the world published the communique of the Khrushchev-Mao Zedong meeting, readers saw a photograph of US President's special envoy Murphy, who was then active in the Near East, in the most prominent position on the front page of "Borba" (organ of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia). Everyone knows Murphy's role. He came there following American tanks, aiming to accomplish what the generals could not. In a news item published next to Murphy's photo, "Borba" portrayed Murphy as an angel of peace, before whom the people of the Near East opened their hearts. If one were to believe "Borba," Murphy's mission was to "correct the negative effects caused by American policy." However, even sober-minded and progressive people in the United States itself do not believe this nonsense! As for the communique of the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and China, "Borba" only published a summary of it. There was no space to publish the full text!

    On August 5th, newspapers around the world published editorials and articles widely commenting on the results of the Khrushchev-Mao Zedong meeting. Socialist countries' newspapers emphasized the importance and consistency of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China's commitment to defending peace. Yugoslav newspapers did not publish any commentaries. "Borba" reprinted a commentary from "The New York Times" instead of writing its own article. Indeed, after publishing Murphy's photo, reprinting an article from "The New York Times" is very logical!

    Now, let's introduce the "New York Times" commentary published by "Borba":

    "To the entire West, especially to the United States and Britain, the far-fetched and unfounded accusations show that Moscow and Beijing have further intensified, rather than eased, international tensions.

    "After Saturday's talks, Khrushchev and Mao Zedong undoubtedly knew the events of the day. They knew that the United States had recognized Iraq and that Jordan had formally abolished its alliance with Iraq.

    "Every well-informed observer of Middle Eastern affairs should admit that these efforts are steps that help ease tensions in the region. But the Beijing communique accused the United States and Britain of 'armed threats' against Iraq and once again accused Western countries of 'pushing humanity to the brink of war disaster.'

    "Last week, the West intensified its efforts to ease international tensions and convene a summit meeting.

    "The Soviet-Chinese communique is a silent response to these efforts by the West, a response that contradicts the claim of these two that they support the cause of peace.

    "The West cannot but consider the arguments contained in this communique and the shadows it casts on the international situation when formulating its future plans."

    Above, we have presented the "New York Times" article published in the Yugoslav newspaper in its original form, so that readers can see who is walking with whom. We stand with the People's Republic of China and with all socialist countries. We have common goals, a common line for building socialism and communism, and a common policy aimed at consolidating peace and opposing the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors.

    But who are the Yugoslav leaders walking with? Why do they think the views of the American bourgeois press are the most accurate explanation of the significance of the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and China? Does this not prove that Yugoslav newspapers are acting as echo chambers for others in assessing major international events?

    It is not surprising that such a "commentary" appeared in "The New York Times." This newspaper represents the interests of the American aggression groups, who have to resort to their usual slander and distortion, turning black into white and making clumsy defenses in front of the public.

    "The New York Times" clamors that the accusations against the United States and Britain for aggression in the Near East are "unfounded." "The New York Times" believes that the landing of American and British armed forces in Lebanon and Jordan is a step to "ease tensions." The American propaganda hacks believe that the firm determination of socialist countries to stop the aggressors' conspiracies is intensifying "international tensions." But what can be said about "Borba"? This newspaper echoes the views of "The New York Times." In other words, it is in the same camp as the American aggression groups. The editorial department of "Borba" did not add a single word; it believed that "The New York Times" had already expressed its opinion.

    The weekly "Kommunist," the organ of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, published an article about the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and China. However, to put it mildly, even this article is under the ideological influence of "The New York Times" reporter. The author follows the American masters, shamelessly slandering the Soviet Union and People's China, and trying to make people doubt the two countries' concern for the peace movement.

    "The New York Times" slanders that "Moscow and Beijing have further intensified, rather than eased, international tensions."

    The Yugoslav weekly "Kommunist" also says in the same tone that it seems that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China believe that the "interests of some negative policy" are of much greater significance than the joint efforts to stop the real danger to world peace.

    Different wording, but the spirit is the same, and that is the American spirit! The only thing that the Yugoslav newspapers added was to amplify the tone of the American reactionary newspapers, saying that the socialist camp's exposure of Yugoslav revisionism is splitting the forces of peace. However, everyone knows that today, the forces of peace are more united than ever before. As for the Yugoslav leaders, they themselves have deviated from the peace movement.

    In answering the article in China's "Ta Kung Pao," "Politika" insisted that Yugoslavia's actions are seen by others (who? -- the newspaper forgot to specify) as a significant contribution to the cause of peace, especially considering that such actions are not controlled by the interests and policies of any bloc. But the problem is precisely that Yugoslavia's policy of speculation between the imperialist camp and the socialist camp will not and cannot serve the cause of peace.

    It is not the fault of the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China that the Yugoslav leaders are unwilling to join the great ranks of peace warriors. The Yugoslav leaders' policies are increasingly exposing themselves, and they cannot blame anyone but themselves for this.

    Struggling for peace and fighting against the conspiracies of aggressors are not empty words, nor are they objects of political tricks, but an urgent and pressing cause, the sacred duty of millions of people. The practice of playing both sides between aggressors and peace warriors cannot serve this cause.

    Yugoslav revisionist ideologues are trying to escape the fire of criticism under the guise of defending peace, but this trick cannot deceive anyone. The international communist movement has been able to grow and achieve victories of world historical significance precisely because this movement has purged all those who have gone astray, all those who, under the guise of "revising" Marxist-Leninist theory, have attempted to emasculate the revolutionary spirit of Marxism and deprive it of its main weapon—the spirit of irreconcilability toward class enemies. Fighting for the purity of Marxism-Leninism is the primary cause of every Communist. The struggle against revisionism, needless to say, will not hinder the struggle of Communists for peace. On the contrary, the more united the world communist movement is, the more consistent the socialist camp—the peace camp—is, the more the imperialist aggressors will have to think carefully, and the greater people's confidence in shattering their conspiracies.

    The forces of peace know that true concern for maintaining peace is very different from the flowery words used to mask selfish interests and acts of aggression. It was under the guise of singing the false praises of peace that the American and British aggressors invaded Lebanon and Jordan.

    The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all the socialist camp countries will continue to unite the forces of peace, not just in words, but in action, and lead them to the victory of the cause of peace.

### 应声虫  苏联“真理报”观察家

专栏：

　　应声虫
　　苏联“真理报”观察家
    苏联和中华人民共和国两国领导人赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志的会谈是为防止威胁着人类的新战争而斗争的过程中的一件大事。各社会主义国家、亚洲国家、阿拉伯国家、一切爱好和平的人们都一致认为，这次会谈是对和平事业的重大贡献。受到其他各国人民支持的两个伟大社会主义国家发出的警告打下了最狂妄的军国主义者的气焰，并迫使他们深思。事实就是这样，全世界的进步舆论都承认了这些事实。可是南斯拉夫对这个具有历史意义的事件却采取不同的态度。
    8月4日，正当世界的报刊刊登了赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东的会谈公报时，读者却在“战斗报”（南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会机关报）的第一版最显著的地位看到了当时在近东活动的美国总统特使墨菲的照片。墨菲的作用是大家都知道的。他是跟着美国坦克来到那里的，目的是为了完成将军们所不能完成的事情。“战斗报”在美国特使照片旁边所刊登的一条消息中把墨菲描绘成一个和平的天使，在他的面前近东人们敞开了他们的心。如果相信“战斗报”的话，墨菲的使命就是“纠正美国政策所引起的消极影响”。然而，甚至在美国本国头脑清醒和进步的人们也不相信这套胡言乱语！至于苏联和中国领导人的会谈公报，“战斗报”只刊登了它的摘要。没有篇幅来刊登全文！
    8月5日世界报刊都发表社论和编辑部文章，广泛地评论了赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东会谈的结果。社会主义国家的报刊在这方面强调指出苏联和中华人民共和国致力于保卫和平的重要性和一贯性。南斯拉夫报刊没有发表评论。“战斗报”转载了“纽约时报”的评论来代替自己的文章。不错，在刊登了墨菲像片之后，又转载“纽约时报”的文章，这是很合乎逻辑的！
    现在把“战斗报”刊登的美国报纸的这个评论介绍如下：
    “对于整个西方，特别是对于美国和英国的捕风捉影和毫无根据的指责表明，莫斯科和北京进一步加剧了，而不是缓和了国际紧张局势。
    “在星期六会谈以后，赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东毫无疑问知道了当天的事件。他们知道了，美国承认了伊拉克，约旦正式废除了它同伊拉克的联盟。
    “每一个通晓事理的中东问题观察家都应当承认，这些努力是有助于缓和这个地区紧张局势的步骤。但是在北京的公报中却指责美国和英国‘武装威胁’伊拉克，并且再一次指责西方国家‘把人类推上了战争灾难的边缘’。
    “在上星期西方加紧努力来缓和国际紧张局势和召开最高级代表会议。
    “苏中公报是对西方这些努力的沉默的回答，这个回答是同这两个人所谓他们支持和平事业的论调相矛盾的。
    “西方在拟定它的未来的计划时，不能不考虑这个公报所包含的并且给国际局势投上了阴影的论点。”
    上面我们把南斯拉夫报纸上刊登的“纽约时报”的这篇文章原封未动地介绍了出来，目的是让读者可以看到谁同谁走在一起。我们同中华人民共和国、同社会主义阵营各国走在一起。我们有共同的目标，共同的建设社会主义和共产主义的路线、共同的旨在巩固和平和反对帝国主义侵略者阴谋的政策。
    而南斯拉夫领导人究竟是同谁走在一起呢？为什么他们认为美国资产阶级报刊的观点是最正确地阐明了苏中两国领导人会谈的意义呢？这难道不是证明，南斯拉夫报刊在估价重大国际事件时是作别人的应声虫吗？
    在“纽约时报”上出现这样一种“评论”是不足为奇的。这家报纸代表美国侵略集团的利益，他们不得不采取惯用的、诽谤和歪曲的手段，颠倒黑白，在公众面前进行拙劣的辩解。
    “纽约时报”大声叫嚷着，说什么指责美国和英国侵略近东是“没有根据的”。“纽约时报”认为，美国和英国武装部队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆是“缓和紧张局势”的步骤。美国御用宣传家认为，社会主义国家制止侵略者阴谋的坚定决心倒是加剧“国际紧张局势”。可是对“战斗报”可以说些什么呢？这家报纸附和“纽约时报”的观点。换句话说，它是同美国侵略集团处在一个阵营内。“战斗报”编辑部没有增添一个字，它认为“纽约时报”已经表达了它的意见。
    南共中央机关刊物“共产主义者”周刊发表了一篇有关苏中两国领导人会谈的文章。可是，客气一点说，即使这篇文章也是处在“纽约时报”记者的思想影响之下。文章的作者追随美国主子，无耻地诽谤苏联和人民中国，企图使人们对这两个国家对于和平运动的关怀发生怀疑。
    “纽约时报”诬蔑说：“莫斯科和北京进一步加剧了，而不是缓和了国际紧张局势”。
    南斯拉夫“共产主义者”周刊也是以同样的口吻说，似乎苏联和中华人民共和国认为“某种消极政策的利益”比制止对世界和平的真正危险的共同努力，其意义要大得多。
    说法不同，但是精神只有一个，那就是美国的精神！南斯拉夫的报纸添加进去的唯一的东西，就是发挥美国反动报纸的基调，说什么，社会主义阵营国家揭露南斯拉夫的修正主义就是分裂和平力量。但是，大家知道，今天，和平力量比任何时期都更加团结了。至于南斯拉夫的领导人，那是他们自己脱离了和平运动。
    “政治报”在答复中国“大公报”的文章时硬说，南斯拉夫的行动被别人（是谁？——报纸忘了注明）看作是对和平事业的重大贡献，特别是如果考虑到，这种行动没有被集团的利益和政策所左右。但是，问题恰恰在于，南斯拉夫在帝国主义阵营和社会主义阵营之间投机取巧的政策是不会、也不可能为和平事业服务的。
    南斯拉夫领导人不愿加入和平战士的大队，这也不是苏联或者中华人民共和国的过错。南斯拉夫领导人的政策越来越暴露了他们自己，这点除了他们自己之外，不能责怪任何别的人。
    为和平而斗争和为反对侵略者的阴谋而斗争并不是一些空话，也不是政治把戏的对象，而是刻不容缓的和迫切需要的事业，是千千万万人的神圣职责。在侵略者和和平战士之间左右逢源的做法是不能为这个事业服务的。
    南斯拉夫修正主义思想家企图在保卫和平的假幌子下逃避批评的火力，但是这种伎俩是欺骗不了任何人的。国际共产主义运动之所以能够成长起来并获得世界历史意义的胜利，正是因为这个运动把所有走入歧途的人，把所有披着“修改”马克思列宁主义理论的面具企图阉割马克思主义的革命精神并夺掉它的主要武器——对阶级敌人不调和的精神——的人都清除了出去。为马克思列宁主义的纯洁而斗争，这是每一个共产党人的首要的事业。对修正主义的斗争，不用说是不会妨碍共产党人争取和平的斗争的。恰恰相反，世界共产主义运动越是团结，社会主义阵营—和平阵营越是一致，那么帝国主义侵略者就越是不得不更加深思熟虑，人们对粉碎他们的阴谋的信心也就越大。
    和平力量知道，对维护和平的真正关怀是同用来掩饰自私的利益和侵略行动的花言巧语迥然不同的。美国和英国侵略者就是在高唱和平的假话的掩饰下侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、所有社会主义阵营国家今后也决不是在口头上、而是在行动上团结和平力量，并且把它们引向和平事业的胜利。
