Xinhua News Agency, August 30th. The youth and students of the capital are enthusiastically launching various preparatory activities to welcome the Fifth International Student Union Congress to be held in Beijing.

　　More than six hundred students from more than ten schools including Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Renmin University of China gave up their summer vacation in late July and enthusiastically participated in various voluntary labor activities to serve the congress, such as renovating the venue, roads, and office buildings for the congress staff. The students were very enthusiastic about their labor, believing that it was a great honor to contribute to the congress. Now, with the help of the students, the auditorium of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, which serves as the venue for the congress, has been renovated and looks brand new. Zhengyi Road near the venue, the sidewalks on both sides and in the middle, have been completely paved with new cement bricks, making it look neat and beautiful. From the representatives' residence - the Xinqiao Hotel to the venue, from the eastern suburbs to the airport, many huge posters and slogan towers welcoming student representatives from various countries have been erected along the road to the venue. These were produced overnight by students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Students from the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts also specially designed twenty-nine kinds of propaganda posters for the congress.

　　Students from various universities and colleges in the capital are also preparing to exhibit the achievements of work-study programs in universities and colleges to welcome the opening of the congress, which will open on September 1st. The exhibition will showcase the situation of universities and colleges in the capital running factories on a large scale and in terms of inventions, creations, and cutting-edge technologies, fully reflecting our country's educational policy of serving politics and combining education with labor. The layout, design, construction, and narrator work of this exhibition are all undertaken by the students themselves, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Central Academy of Drama, among other academies, are working overnight to produce large charts. Students from various universities and colleges are also enthusiastically preparing to invite students from various countries to visit schools in batches for joint celebrations. The university student choir is actively rehearsing programs, preparing to perform for the guests.

    首都学生迎接国际学联第五届代表大会
    新华社30日讯　首都的青年和学生正在热情地展开各项筹备活动，迎接即将在北京召开的国际学联第五届代表大会。
    清华大学、北京大学和中国人民大学等十多个学校的六百多个学生，在7月下旬就放弃了暑期休息，热情地参加了各种为大会服务的义务劳动，如整修会场、马路和大会工作人员办公楼等，学生们劳动热情非常高，认为自己能为大会贡献出一份力量是莫大的荣誉。现在，在同学们的协助下，作为大会会场的共青团中央礼堂已修饰得焕然一新。会场附近的正义路，两旁和中间的人行道上，已全部铺上了新的洋灰砖。显得整齐而美观。从代表们的住处——新侨饭店到会场，从东郊到机场，到会场沿路树起了许多幅巨大的欢迎各国学生代表的宣传画和标语塔，这些都是由中央美术学院同学连夜赶制出来的。中央工艺美术学院学生还专门为大会设计了二十九种宣传画。
    首都各院校的学生为迎接大会的召开，还准备展出高等学校勤工俭学成绩的展览会，将在9月1日开幕。在展览会上将要展出首都各院校大办工厂和在发明创造、尖端技术方面的情况，充分反映我国教育为政治服务和教育与劳动结合的教育方针。这个展览会的布置、设计、施工、解说员工作，全部由学生自己担任，中央美术学院和中央戏剧学院等学院还连夜赶制大型图表。各院校学生还热情地准备邀请各国学生分批去学校联欢。大学生合唱团正在积极排练节目，准备为客人们演出。
