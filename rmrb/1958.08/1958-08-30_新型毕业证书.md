    New Type of Graduation Certificate
    Zhang Desheng, a cadre from Anlu County, Hubei Province, who was sent to work at the grassroots level, recently "graduated" during his labor training. The leadership decided to transfer him to a new position. Before he left, the members of the Guangming Second Cooperative in Chengbei Township, where he worked, held a meeting to discuss what kind of "graduation certificate" to issue to Zhang Desheng. Some suggested writing "Labor Model," others suggested writing "Labor Hero," and everyone argued endlessly. Later, Huang Jinzhong, a 70-year-old cooperative member, said, "Neither hero nor model can express our feelings. In my opinion, it is more appropriate to write 'The Person Most Loved by the Cooperative Members'." So everyone unanimously agreed to award Zhang Desheng the title of "The Person Most Loved by the Cooperative Members."
    To become the person most loved by the peasant masses when carrying out labor training in the countryside - all cadres sent to work at the grassroots level should have this kind of ambition.

    新型毕业证书
    湖北安陆县下放干部张德胜，最近在劳动锻炼中“毕业”了，领导上决定调他担任新的职务，临走时，他所在的城北乡光明二社的社员开会，讨论究竟发给张德胜什么样的“毕业证书”好？有的主张写：“劳动模范”，有的主张写：“劳动英雄”，你一言我一语，争论不休。后来，七十岁的老社员黄金忠说：“什么英雄呀！模范呀！都不能表达我们的心意，依我看呐，写上‘社员最爱戴的人’才合适”。于是大家一致同意授予张德胜“社员最爱戴的人”的称号。
    到农村进行劳动锻炼的人，成为农民群众最爱戴的人，一切下放干部都应该有这种志气。
