Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 29th: The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 29th condemning the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique for continuing provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait. It pointed out that peace-loving people must do their best to stop the claws of imperialism and prevent it from interfering with the Chinese people's liberation of their territory.
　　
The newspaper warned the United States that it must think again about whether it wants to conspire to intervene. The newspaper pointed out that if the United States were to do so, all of Asia would oppose it. Furthermore, China's position is becoming increasingly stronger.
　　
"Dongxing Daily" reported on the 28th that Supardi, a member of the Indonesian Parliament's National Defense Subcommittee, told reporters from the newspaper that he requested the government to stop American interference because the problem in the Taiwan Strait area is China's internal affair.
　　
He pointed out that the fact that Chinese artillery bombarded Jinmen Island shows that China will never be intimidated by the United States. China's combat capability has been tested in Korea.
　　
Member of Parliament Abbas told "Dongxing Daily" reporters that U.S. intimidation of China is futile.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 28th: The Indonesian "Republic Daily" published an editorial on the 27th saying that the dark clouds in the Taiwan Strait are provocative activities deliberately created by the United States. The newspaper hopes that Asian and African countries will be vigilant and not fall into the trap of the United States.
　　
The newspaper pointed out that the United Press International's news about the Jinmen artillery battle gave people the wrong impression that China first launched a massive attack on Jinmen without American provocation.
　　
The newspaper said that if you pay close attention to American reports, you can see that the United States is strengthening its military power in the Far East under the pretext that China is preparing for war. The newspaper said that this is an old trick of the United States to confuse people and shift the blame to others.

　　美国向中国人民挑衅  将受到整个亚洲反对
    雅加达“人民日报”向侵略者提出警告
    新华社雅加达29日电　雅加达“人民日报”29日发表社论谴责美国和蒋介石集团还在台湾海峡进行挑衅活动。它指出，热爱和平的人们必须尽力制止帝国主义的魔爪，不让它干涉中国人民解放他们的领土。
    这家报纸警告美国说，它必须再三思考它是否要阴谋进行干涉。报纸指出，美国如果要这样做，整个亚洲都会反对它。此外，中国的地位正在日益加强。
    “东星报”在28日报道，印度尼西亚国会国防小组委员会委员苏帕迪对这家报纸的记者说，他要求政府制止美国的干涉活动，因为台湾海峡一带发生的问题是中国的内政问题。
    他指出，中国炮兵轰击金门岛这一事实表明，中国决不会被美国吓住。中国的战斗能力在朝鲜已经得到了考验。
    国会议员阿巴斯对“东星报”记者说，美国对中国进行恫吓是徒劳的。
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚“共和国报”27日发表社论说，台湾海峡的乌云是美国制造的故意进行的挑衅活动。这家报纸希望亚非国家提高警惕，不要陷入美国的圈套。
    这家报纸指出，美国合众国际社关于金门炮战的消息给人们以错误的印象，好像是中国首先对金门大举进攻而没有美国的挑衅。
    这家报纸说，如果仔细注意美国的报道就可以看到，美国借口中国正在所谓备战而在远东加强美国的军事力量。这家报纸说，这是美国企图迷惑人们和把罪责转嫁给他人的老伎俩。
