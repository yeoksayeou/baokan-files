On August 8th, the Chinese government issued a statement fully supporting the Soviet government's proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The statement said: The Chinese government believes that all peace-loving countries have a responsibility to take all possible measures to urge the United States and Britain to immediately withdraw their aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan and restore peace in the Middle East. Now, the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly has been convened in accordance with the Security Council's resolution. Peace-loving people of all countries hope that the United Nations Organization will fulfill the solemn responsibilities entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter and make due efforts to safeguard international peace and security.

The crimes of U.S. and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan have been condemned by world public opinion. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said, "If foreign troops continue to remain in the Middle East, the problem will not only not be solved, but will always be at a dangerous juncture." Therefore, he hoped that foreign troops would withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible. The Indonesian government issued a statement pointing out that "the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan will help ease the tension there." The Burmese government asked the United Nations to "intensify efforts to find some way to make the foreign troops in the Middle East withdraw quickly." Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike believes that "the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Middle East is the main condition for striving for regional peace." Many African countries as well as political figures and widespread public opinion in European and American countries have also expressed the same hope. Even the pro-American Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government and the Spanish Franco government had to express that the actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East "are not good" and "run counter to the trend of the times." It can be seen that the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan is the consensus of the world.

However, it can be seen from the discussions at the Security Council meeting on the 7th that there are two completely different ideas regarding this emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Iraq, and the United Arab Republic advocated discussing the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, while the U.S. and British aggressors attempted to discuss at this meeting the so-called accusations by Lebanon and Jordan against the United Arab Republic for "interfering in their internal affairs." It is very obvious that the U.S. and British aggressors, in a situation where they could not but agree to convene the emergency session of the General Assembly, are making every effort to confuse right and wrong in order to cover up their aggressive acts. Not only that, but the U.S. representative repeated the myth of "indirect aggression" at the Security Council meeting, and the British representative also insisted that the aggressive acts of the U.S. and Britain were in accordance with the United Nations Charter. This shows that the U.S. and British aggressors are still trying to trample on the United Nations Charter once again, and that their shameful acts of aggression will be shielded by the United Nations flag.

It can be seen that there will be a tense struggle at this emergency session of the General Assembly. Will the United Nations Organization stand on the road of upholding its Charter and truly become an international institution that defends international peace and security and protects the independence and sovereignty of all countries? Or will it be used by U.S. and British aggressors as their tool of aggression? This is a serious historical test.

Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." However, the United States and Britain have openly occupied Lebanon and Jordan with armed forces, which is not only the most brutal infringement on the territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon and Jordan, but also a serious threat to the Republic of Iraq and the UAR. Obviously, this behavior of the U.S. and British aggressors seriously violates the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and poses a threat to peace in the Middle East and the world. Any excuse or lie by the U.S. and British aggressors cannot cover up their guilt of infringing on the independence and territorial integrity of other countries, endangering peace, and undermining the United Nations Charter. The longer their troops remain in these two countries, the more absurd these excuses become.

The main excuse for the U.S. and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan is the revolution that took place in Iraq. In his speech on July 15th, Eisenhower began by viciously attacking and slandering the events that took place in Iraq, and believed that due to the occurrence of this event, the United States seemed to have no choice but to take emergency military action. Thus, the day after the revolution in Iraq, U.S. troops landed in Lebanon; four days later, British troops occupied Jordan. However, the events that took place in Iraq are clearly its internal affairs. On what basis can the United States and Britain launch armed aggression in the Middle East? Moreover, Iraq has had a revolution. On what basis can the United States and Britain send troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan? If a revolution takes place in a certain country in the world, and other countries can send troops to occupy countries adjacent to it, then where will there be peace in the world? According to the absurd "reason" of the United States, if a revolution occurs in Mexico or Guatemala, can other countries not send troops to occupy the United States? No wonder even the U.S. "Wall Street Journal" feels that this excuse for intervention is untenable. In an editorial on July 28th, it said, "There are about a hundred countries in the world... The governments of many countries are very weak and can be overthrown by revolution at any time." If the precedent of intervention in Lebanon can be established, it is equivalent to "establishing the principle of endless intervention."

Another excuse for the U.S. aggression against Lebanon is that there seems to be so-called "external infiltration" and "indirect aggression" in Lebanon. A long time ago, at the beginning of the Lebanese people's armed opposition to the Chamoun government, the United States vigorously publicized this argument. However, at that time, the United States itself did not consider it as a basis for armed intervention. It was only after the outbreak of the Iraqi revolution on July 14th that Eisenhower seized it as an excuse to send troops to Lebanon. However, this excuse is completely fabricated. People know that the Security Council sent an observation mission to Lebanon in mid-June to investigate the so-called "external infiltration." After nearly two months of investigation, the observation mission, composed of 150 observers from fifteen countries including Ecuador, Norway, Canada, India, and Sweden, confirmed in its two reports issued on July 2nd and July 31st that there was no such "external infiltration." Its second report wrote: "They have never been able to detect the existence of people who have crossed the border for combat purposes." United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld also pointed out this, saying: "We currently have no basis for making this judgment."

After the lie of so-called "external infiltration" went bankrupt, Eisenhower and Dulles had to give a new interpretation of "indirect aggression." They even slandered "Soviet and Cairo radio broadcasts" as "indirect aggression." This is obviously absurd slander. The facts are exactly the opposite of this slander. Soviet and Cairo radio broadcasts are not only not "indirect aggression," but also oppose aggression, oppose interference in internal affairs, safeguard peace, and advocate national independence. If there is any broadcast that is indirect aggression, it is American broadcast. Because, as everyone knows, it is none other than the U.S. government itself that spends tens of millions of dollars every year to run the infamous "Voice of America," "Free Europe," and other radio stations that spread hostility towards the people of all countries in the world, advocate subversion activities, and carry out war propaganda. People can only draw one conclusion from this: the United States is not only the most ferocious direct aggressor in the world, but also the most ferocious indirect aggressor in the world. However, according to the U.S. logic of "indirect aggression," can any country in the world use U.S. radio broadcasts as a reason to send troops to occupy those countries that listen to U.S. broadcasts?

Not long ago, U.S. and British aggressors also vigorously slandered the Iraqi revolution as a result of "indirect aggression," and said that this "indirect aggression" would expand from Iraq to Lebanon and Jordan. However, in this regard, even the reactionary politician of the U.S. ruling group—Eisenhower's representative Murphy—had to say after carrying out activities in Iraq that "the new government seems mainly concerned with eliminating past evils and improving domestic living standards," and that it is "adopting a far-sighted policy" in diplomacy. Is this called "indirect aggression"? Shouldn't every country do this? Now that the U.S. and British lie of Iraqi "indirect aggression" has completely gone bankrupt, and even they themselves have had to recognize the Republic of Iraq, what reason do the U.S. and British aggressors have to continue occupying Lebanon and Jordan and continue threatening the Republic of Iraq and the UAR with force?

When Eisenhower sent troops to invade Lebanon, he also put up the signboard of "protecting overseas Chinese," which is especially absurd. The United States has overseas Chinese in many countries in the world. If this excuse of "protecting overseas Chinese" can be established, then can't most countries in the world be invaded by the United States at any time? On the other hand, many countries in the world also have overseas Chinese in the United States. According to the logic of the United States, can these countries also send troops to land in the United States at any time? The United States has a total of only 2,500 overseas Chinese in Lebanon, but it sent an armed force of 14,000 people and sent these troops all the way to the border of Lebanon. Are the American overseas Chinese living on the border of Lebanon? Moreover, the American overseas Chinese in Lebanon have not been harmed in any way. Eisenhower himself probably understands now that this so-called "reason" is untenable, so he has recently avoided talking about the "protection of overseas Chinese." So, why do U.S. troops still stay in Lebanon?

The U.S. and British aggressors have another excuse. Eisenhower said that U.S. troops were invited by Chamoun; Macmillan said that British troops were invited by Hussein. This excuse does not in any way alleviate the aggressive guilt of the United States and Britain in interfering in internal affairs and undermining the United Nations Charter. As everyone knows, the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and international law do not allow interference in internal affairs and do not allow armed aggression. The freedom to choose the system of one's own country is the most sacred right of the people of all countries that cannot be deprived. The massive invasion of Lebanon and Jordan by U.S. and British troops and the military occupation of these two countries is the most barbaric trampling on the sacred rights of the people of these two countries and the most blatant destruction of the United Nations Charter. If the so-called "invitation" of traitors and tyrants like Chamoun and Hussein who are spurned by the people is allowed to allow foreign troops to carry out armed intervention, then what guarantee is there for the most sacred rights of the people of all countries, and how can the United Nations Charter become the criterion for international relations? May I ask Eisenhower and Macmillan, just because someone asked you to interfere in internal affairs, are you not interfering in internal affairs? Just because someone asks you to invade, can you not be an aggressor? Just because someone asks you to commit a crime, can you not be a criminal? The fact is so clear and unmistakable that all the water of the Mediterranean and even the Atlantic Ocean cannot wash away the aggressive guilt of the United States and Britain in undermining the United Nations Charter. The U.S. and British governments have attempted to invoke Article 51 of the United Nations Charter to defend their actions, but this article states that "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." This proves that their actions are contrary to the United Nations Charter, because there was no external attack on Lebanon or Jordan in the first place.

Any "reason" that can cover up this aggression has been thoroughly refuted by the facts, and has also been thoroughly refuted by the aggressors' own contradictory remarks and actions. The true face of the U.S. and British aggressors has been nakedly displayed before the people of the world. The longer their troops stay in Lebanon and Jordan, the more sinful they are; the longer they stay for an hour, the more sinful they are!

At present, the situation in the Middle East and the world is still in a critical state due to the continued presence of U.S. and British aggressive troops in Lebanon and Jordan, and the continuous reinforcement of troops. Therefore, in order to stop the expansion of the war and eliminate the current critical state in order to maintain peace in the Middle East and the world, it is necessary to first demand that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan. From the day the U.S. and British troops invaded Lebanon and Jordan, peace-loving countries and people all over the world launched a strong struggle against aggression, demanding that U.S. and British troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan. If the emergency session of the General Assembly is to assume the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, then it must first discuss the issue of the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. This is the overriding and most urgent task.

The peace-loving people and countries all over the world cannot allow U.S. and British aggressors to trample on the United Nations Charter and carry out armed intervention in Arab countries; nor can they allow them to use the United Nations flag to cover up and expand their aggressive actions. Stopping aggression and maintaining peace is the combat task of peace-loving people all over the world, and it is also the inescapable responsibility of the United Nations and each of its member states.

The struggle waged by the people of all countries to stop U.S. and British aggression has achieved initial victories, but this struggle must be persisted in. The Chinese government solemnly declares: "No matter what the outcome of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly may be, as long as the aggressive troops of the United States and Britain have not completely withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan for a single day, U.S. and British imperialism cannot escape the serious responsibility for threatening peace and security in the Middle East and the world for a single day, and cannot escape the just condemnation and resolute opposition of the Arab people and the people of all countries in the world for a single day." The 600 million Chinese people will join hands with the peace-loving people of the world to carry out unremitting struggle, and will never give up until they have forced the U.S. and British aggressive troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan and restore peace in the Middle East!

    维护和平的最迫切任务
    8月8日，我国政府发表声明，完全支持苏联政府提出的关于召开联合国大会紧急特别会议讨论美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的建议。声明说：中国政府认为，所有爱好和平的国家有责任采取一切可能的措施促使美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军队，恢复中近东地区的和平。现在，联合国大会紧急特别会议已根据安理会的决议召开了。各国爱好和平人民都希望联合国组织履行联合国宪章所赋予它的庄严职责，为维护国际和平与安全作出应有的努力。
    美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的罪行，受到了世界舆论的谴责。印度总理尼赫鲁说，“如果外国军队继续留在中东，那么问题不但不会解决，而且始终会处于危险关头。”因此他希望外国军队及早撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。印度尼西亚政府发表声明指出，“外国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦将有助于缓和那里的紧张局势”。缅甸政府要求联合国“加紧努力找出某种办法，使中东的外国军队迅速撤退”。锡兰总理班达拉奈克认为，“美英军队立即撤出中东是争取地区和平的主要条件”。许多非洲国家以及欧美国家的政治界人士和广大舆论，也表示了同样的希望。甚至像亲美的日本岸信介政府和西班牙佛朗哥政府，也不得不表示：美英在中东的行动“是不好的”，是“违背了时代的潮流”。可见，美英军队必须立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退，这是全世界的公论。
    但是，从安理会7日会议的讨论中可以看出，对于这次联合国大会紧急会议有两种截然不同的想法。苏联、伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国的代表主张讨论从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出美国和英国军队的问题，而美英侵略者却企图在这个会上讨论什么黎巴嫩和约旦对阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉它们的内政”的所谓控告。事情很明显，美英侵略者在不得不同意召开联大紧急会议的情况下，竭力企图混淆是非，以掩饰它们的侵略行为。不仅如此，美国代表在安理会会议上又重复了什么“间接侵略”的神话，英国代表也硬说美英的侵略行为是符合于联合国宪章的，这表明美英侵略者还妄想再一次蹂躏联合国宪章，妄想他们的可耻的侵略罪行得到联合国旗帜的掩护。
    由此可见，在这次的联大紧急会议上将有一场紧张的斗争。联合国组织究竟是站到维护它的宪章的道路上来，真正成为保卫国际和平和安全、保卫各国独立和主权完整的国际机构呢？还是被美英侵略者利用来作为它们的侵略工具呢？这是一次严重的历史考验。
    联合国宪章第二条第四款明文规定：“所有会员国在它们的国际关系中不得以武力相威胁或使用武力来侵害任何国家的领土完整或政治独立，亦不得以任何其他同联合国宗旨不符的方式以武力相威胁或使用武力。”但是，美英两国却公然以武装部队侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，这不但是对黎巴嫩和约旦的领土完整和政治独立的最粗暴的侵害，而且是对伊拉克共和国和阿联的严重威胁。显然，美英侵略者的这种行为严重地违犯了联合国宪章的基本原则，并造成了对中东和世界和平的威胁。美英侵略者的任何借口，任何谎言都掩饰不了它们侵害别国独立和领土完整、危害和平和破坏联合国宪章的罪责。它们的军队留在这两个国家的时间越久，这些借口就越显得荒谬绝伦。
    美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的主要借口就是伊拉克发生了革命。艾森豪威尔在7月15日的演说中，一开头就对伊拉克国内所发生的事件进行了恶毒的攻击和诬蔑，并且认为由于这个事件的发生，似乎美国就不得不采取紧急的军事行动。于是，就在伊拉克发生革命的第二天，美国军队登陆黎巴嫩；第四天，英国军队又占领约旦。但是，伊拉克国内发生的事件，明明是它的内政，美英究竟凭什么可以在中东发动武装侵略呢？而且，伊拉克发生了革命，美英又凭什么竟可以出兵占领黎巴嫩和约旦呢？如果世界上某一个国家发生革命，别的国家就可以派兵占领同它邻近的国家，那么世界上那里还会有安宁呢？按照美国这个荒谬的“理由”，如果墨西哥或者危地马拉发生革命，别的国家岂不是也可以派兵占领美国吗？无怪乎连美国的“华尔街日报”也感到这种干涉的借口站不住脚。它在7月28日的一篇社论中说，“全世界大约有百来个国家。……许多国家的政府很软弱，随时可能被革命推翻。”如果干涉黎巴嫩的先例可以确立，那就等于“确立了无止境的干涉的原则”。
    美国侵略黎巴嫩的另一个借口是，在黎巴嫩似乎存在着所谓“外来渗入”和“间接侵略”。还在好久以前，在黎巴嫩人民武装反对夏蒙政府之初，美国就大肆宣传这种论调了。不过，那时美国自己也并没有认为可以把它作为进行武装干涉的根据。只是在7月14日伊拉克革命爆发以后，艾森豪威尔才把它抓来作为出兵黎巴嫩的借口。然而，这个借口不过是完全出于捏造。人们知道，安理会在6月中旬曾经派遣一个观察团到黎巴嫩去调查所谓“外来渗入”。这个由厄瓜多尔、挪威、加拿大、印度、瑞典等十五个国家的一百五十名观察员组成的观察团，经过近两个月的调查以后，在它的7月2日和7月31日发表的两次报告中都证实，并没有这种“外来渗入”的存在。它的第二次报告写道：“他们绝没有能够发觉有确实为了作战目的越界入境的人员的存在”。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德也曾经指出了这一点，他说：“我们目前还没有作这种判断的根据。”
    在所谓“外来渗入”的谎言破产以后，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯不得不把“间接侵略”作了新的解释，他们甚至诬蔑“苏联和开罗的广播”就是“间接侵略”。这显然是无稽的诬蔑。事实和这种诬蔑恰恰相反。苏联的和开罗的广播非但不是“间接侵略”，而且正是反对侵略、反对干涉内政、维护和平、主张民族独立的。如果说有什么广播是间接侵略的话，那就是美国的广播。因为，谁都知道，在全世界散布敌视世界各国人民、鼓吹颠复活动、进行战争宣传的，不是别人，恰恰是每年花成千万美元来举办臭名昭彰的“美国之音”、“自由欧洲”等电台的美国政府自己。人们从这里只能得出一个结论：美国既是世界上最凶恶的直接侵略者，又是世界上最凶恶的间接侵略者。但是，按照美国的“间接侵略”的逻辑，难道世界上任何一个国家可以把美国的广播作为理由，就派兵去占领那些收听美国广播的国家吗？
    不久以前，美英侵略者还大肆诬蔑伊拉克革命为“间接侵略”的结果，并且说这种“间接侵略”将由伊拉克扩张到黎巴嫩和约旦。但是，在这方面，甚至美国统治集团的反动政客——艾森豪威尔的代表墨菲在到伊拉克进行活动以后也不得不说，“新政府主要关心的看来是想消除过去的罪恶和提高国内的生活水平”，它在外交上正在“采取一种有远见的政策”。难道这就叫做“间接侵略”吗？难道任何国家不都应当这样做吗？现在，美国和英国说伊拉克“间接侵略”的谎言彻底破产了，连它们自己也不得不承认了伊拉克共和国。既然是这样，美英侵略者究竟还有什么理由继续占领黎巴嫩和约旦，继续对伊拉克共和国和阿联进行武力威胁呢？
    艾森豪威尔派兵侵略黎巴嫩的时候，还打起了“保护侨民”的招牌，这尤其是荒唐绝顶。美国在世界上许多国家里都有侨民，如果这种“保护侨民”的借口可以成立，那么世界上大部分国家岂不是随时都可以遭到美国的侵略？从另一方面说，世界上许多国家在美国也都有侨民，按照美国的逻辑，这些国家岂不是也都随时可以派兵在美国登陆么？美国在黎巴嫩一共只有两千五百名侨民，却派去了武装部队一万四千人，而且把这些部队一直派到黎巴嫩的边界。难道美国侨民是住在黎巴嫩的边界的吗？何况，美国在黎巴嫩的侨民根本没有受到任何危害，艾森豪威尔本人现在大概也心里明白这个所谓“理由”站不住脚，所以近来他对于“保护侨民”的说法已经避而不谈了。那么，美国军队为什么还赖在黎巴嫩不走呢？
    美英侵略者还有一个借口。艾森豪威尔说，美国军队是夏蒙请去的；麦克米伦说，英国军队是侯赛因请去的。这个借口丝毫也不能减轻美国和英国武力干涉内政、破坏联合国宪章的侵略罪责。大家知道，联合国宪章和国际法的基本准则是不容许干涉内政，不容许武装侵略。自由选择自己国家的制度是各国人民的不容剥夺的最神圣的权利。美英军队大举侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，并对这两个国家实行军事占领，这是对这两个国家人民的神圣权利最野蛮的蹂躏，是对联合国宪章的最粗暴的破坏。如果因为有像夏蒙和侯赛因这样的为人民唾弃的卖国贼和独夫的所谓“邀请”就容许外国军队进行武装干涉，那末各国人民的最神圣的权利又有什么保障，联合国宪章又怎能成为国际关系的准则呢？请问艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦辈，难道因为有人请你们干涉内政，你们就不是干涉内政吗？难道因为有人请你们侵略，你们就可以不是侵略者吗？难道有人请你们犯罪，你们就可以不是罪犯吗？事实是这样明明白白，倾地中海以至大西洋之水，也无法洗刷美国和英国破坏联合国宪章的侵略罪责。美英政府曾企图援引联合国宪章第五十一条为它们的行动辩护，但是，这个条文说，“联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时，在安全理事会采取必要办法，以维持国际和平及安全以前，本宪章不得认为禁止行使单独或集体自卫之自然权利。”这正好证明它们的行动是违背联合国宪章的，因为无论在黎巴嫩或约旦，本来就根本没有受到任何外来攻击。
    任何可以掩盖这种侵略的“理由”都被事实所彻底驳倒，而且也被侵略者自己的自相矛盾的言论和行动所彻底驳倒了。美英侵略者的本来面目已经赤裸裸地摆在世界人民的面前。他们的军队在黎巴嫩和约旦多留一天，就多一天的罪恶，多留一小时，就多一小时的罪恶！
    目前，中东和世界的局势，由于美英侵略军队继续留在黎巴嫩和约旦，并不断增兵，而仍然处于危急状态。因此，为了制止战火的扩大，消除目前的危急状态，以维护中东和世界和平，那就必须首先要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退它们的侵略军队。自从美国和英国的军队侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的一天起，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民就展开了强大的抗议侵略的斗争，要求美国和英国军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去。如果联大紧急会议要负起维护国际和平与安全的责任，那么就必须首先讨论美国和英国从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军的问题，这是压倒一切的最迫切的任务。
    全世界爱好和平的人民和国家不能允许美英侵略者蹂躏联合国宪章，对阿拉伯国家进行武装干涉；更不能允许它们利用联合国的旗帜来掩饰和扩大它们的侵略行为。制止侵略，维护和平，这是全世界爱好和平人民的战斗任务，也是联合国和它的每一个会员国的不容推诿的责任。
    各国人民为制止美英侵略而进行的斗争已取得了初步的胜利，但是这个斗争还必须坚持下去。我国政府严正地声明：“不管联合国大会紧急特别会议召开的结果如何，只要有一天美国和英国的侵略军队还没有完全撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，美、英帝国主义就一天不能逃脱威胁中近东和世界和平和安全的严重责任，就一天不能逃脱阿拉伯人民和世界各国人民的正义谴责和坚决反对。”六亿中国人民将与全世界爱好和平的人民一道，再接再厉地进行不懈的斗争，不达到迫使美英侵略军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，恢复中近东的和平，决不罢休！
