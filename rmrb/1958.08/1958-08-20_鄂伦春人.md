　　The Oroqen People
　　Yan Chen
　　Birch bark is made into a cradle, mare's milk is used as nourishment, the wind sings you lullabies, and ice and snow temper you to be very strong. Childhood is spent on horseback, climbing cliffs is like flying on level ground, and you camp out on the ice in winter nights, fearing nothing of the minus fifty degrees cold! The layers upon layers of deep mountains never cause you to lose your way, and the dense primitive forests are your familiar home. The sika deer cannot escape your keen eyes, and the great bear trembles at the sight of you. A hundred paces away, the hunting rifle is raised, and the running beast immediately falls to the ground in response. Ah! Oroqen people, our simple and kind brothers, for hundreds of years you have suffered all kinds of bullying, and the enemy has tried to eliminate you many times. No, you are brave and tenacious. Today, the high mountains and great rivers are in your hands. Mount your steeds, let all four hooves take flight, and leap from primitive life to socialism!

　　鄂伦春人
　　严辰白桦皮做成摇篮，马奶子当作乳浆，风儿为你唱催眠曲，冰雪锻炼得你十分坚强。童年在骏马背上度过，攀登绝壁就像平地飞行，冬夜里露宿冰上，怕什么零下五十度的寒冷！重重叠叠的深山，从来不会使你迷失方向，密密层层的原始林，原是你熟悉的家乡。花鹿逃不过你敏锐的眼光，大熊见到你也要颤栗，百步之外，猎枪举起，奔跑的野兽立即应声倒地。呵！鄂伦春民族，我们淳朴善良的兄弟，几百年来你受尽欺侮，敌人多少次想把你消灭。不，你们是勇敢顽强的，今天高山大河握在你们手里，跨上骏马，让四蹄腾空，从原始的生活飞跃向社会主义！
