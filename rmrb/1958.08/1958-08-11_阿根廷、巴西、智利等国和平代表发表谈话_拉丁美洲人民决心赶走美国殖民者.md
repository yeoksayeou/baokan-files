Xinhua News Agency report by Yu Minsheng, Yuan Mu, and Wang Boqing:

Peace representatives from six Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, and Paraguay, are currently visiting China. When interviewed by reporters, they spoke freely about the struggles of the Latin American people for national independence.

For many years, Latin America has been regarded by American imperialism as its "backyard garden." Rojas, the Chilean peace representative from Neruda's hometown, said when talking about this issue: "American imperialism still cruelly oppresses and plunders the people of Latin American countries. However, this is no longer the peaceful backyard garden of American colonialists. The Latin American people will one day throw the colonialists out of the backyard garden, and that day is not far off!"

Brazilian representative Pereira said: "In the past, American imperialists could barge into our garden like pigs, wantonly trampling on the fruits carefully cultivated by the Latin American people. Now, the awakened people want to enjoy their own fruits and also use the leftover fruit cores to reciprocate the American imperialists."

The victorious confidence of these Latin American peace fighters is fully justified. In this era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, from the Caribbean to Cape Horn, anti-colonialist flames are burning everywhere. The era when colonialists could do whatever they wanted has passed, and news of the people's victories continues to come: In Cuba, the United States recently sent troops to suppress the Cuban people. Under the resistance of the Cuban people and the pressure of world opinion, imperialism had to withdraw its claws. In Haiti, the people crushed the American conspiracy to subvert the Haitian government on July 29. In Venezuela, where the anti-colonialist struggle has achieved significant victories, the people crushed a conspiracy coup organized by pro-American elements. Puerto Rico, a colony ruled by the United States for fifty-nine years, has seen new developments in its national independence struggle. In the three important Latin American countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, patriotic forces have achieved widespread development. The Latin American people angrily protested the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by the United States and Britain, and mass rallies and demonstrations were held in many cities. The just struggle of the Arab people has encouraged the national independence movement of the Latin American people, and the development of the national independence movement of the Latin American people has also strongly supported the struggle of the Arab people.

The peace representatives from the six countries told reporters that in Latin America, an increasingly broad spectrum of people is participating in the struggle against their common enemy – American imperialism. People have demonstrated an indomitable fighting will in the struggle. Workers, peasants, artisans, intellectuals, and even the national bourgeoisie have joined the ranks of the anti-colonialist struggle. Tens of thousands of peasants have formed people's guerrilla forces, engaging in life-and-death struggles with American imperialism and domestic reactionary forces. A peace fighter from Cuba once told reporters: "Although American colonialists and their running dogs are carrying out extremely cruel suppression of the people's struggle for freedom and independence, the flames of anti-colonialism are burning ever more brightly, and the flames of people's anger cannot be extinguished by any reactionary force!"

In Colombia, the peasant uprising war for freedom and national independence has lasted for ten years. Now this war is in full swing. The peasant army opposes the financial oligarchs and landlords who rely on the aggressive forces of American imperialism to rule Colombia and "demands immediate land reform." Although the Colombian authorities have sent 100,000 troops to suppress the uprising forces, the people's armed struggle is still being carried out indomitably.

In Argentina, the peace movement and the anti-colonialist movement have merged together. The Argentine Conference for International Cooperation, Universal Disarmament, and National Independence, held in Buenos Aires in May this year, is a powerful illustration of this. Argentine peace representative and radiology expert Zorilla told reporters: "In order to maintain peace and oppose the aggression of American imperialism, the Argentine people will never stop their struggle at any time."

Chilean peace fighter Rojas's introduction to the reporters of the Chilean people's struggle against the so-called "Law for the Defense of Democracy" and the "U.S.-Chile Military Mutual Assistance Agreement" most vividly illustrates the indomitable fighting spirit of the Latin American people. The "Law for the Defense of Democracy," promulgated in 1948 by the Chilean dictator and former President Videla under the manipulation of the United States, is called "the worst law" by the Chilean people. For ten years, the Chilean people have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle to abolish the reactionary "Law for the Defense of Democracy" and the traitorous "U.S.-Chile Military Mutual Assistance Agreement." In the brutal struggle, many people were arrested and imprisoned, and many people paid with their lives, but for ten years, the struggle has never stopped. The people's blood has not been shed in vain. Not long ago, the reactionary "Law for the Defense of Democracy" was abolished. Mr. Rojas, in explaining the significance of this victory, said: "The abolition of this reactionary bill will enable the Chilean Communist Party to exist legally and carry out open activities, and the patriotic and democratic forces in Chile will rapidly grow and develop. This victory will also encourage people to continue to fight for the abolition of the 'U.S.-Chile Military Mutual Assistance Agreement'."

The political enslavement and economic exploitation by American imperialism have brought endless disasters and extreme poverty to the rich Latin America. The peace fighters from various countries denounced the aggressive crimes of the American colonialists to reporters, and they also pointed out that since the colonialists have personally sown the seeds of hatred, they will inevitably reap the consequences.

The peace fighters told reporters that in the past ten years, the United States has carried out as many as fourteen major subversion activities in Latin America. Under their direction and manipulation, countless progressive people fighting for national independence and peace have been subjected to cruel persecution, and many have been arrested and shot. Economically, the United States now controls 60% of Latin America's oil, 90% of Chile's copper, 80% of Mexico's minerals, and 50% of Cuba's sugar. The profits obtained by American monopoly capitalists from there are staggering. From 1946 to 1955 alone, the United States extracted $7.767 billion from Latin America. The Latin American people will never forget that due to the unscrupulous exploitation of American imperialism, most of the more than 190 million people in Latin America live in slums. In Chile, with a population of more than six million, more than 100,000 people are unemployed. In Argentina, the cost of living has risen by more than 200% in the past two years.

The peace fighters from various Latin American countries finally expressed to reporters in a firm tone that although the struggle is arduous and tortuous, the final victory will surely belong to the Latin American people!

### 阿根廷、巴西、智利等国和平代表发表谈话　拉丁美洲人民决心赶走美国殖民者

　　阿根廷、巴西、智利等国和平代表发表谈话
　　拉丁美洲人民决心赶走美国殖民者
    据新华社讯　记者于民生、袁木和汪波清报道：来自阿根廷、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、古巴和巴拉圭等六个拉丁美洲国家的和平代表，最近正在我国访问，他们在接见记者的时候畅谈了拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立斗争的情况。
    拉丁美洲多少年来一直被美帝国主义看做是它的“屋后花园”。来自聂鲁达故乡的智利和平代表罗哈斯在谈到这个问题时说：“美帝国主义至今还残酷地压迫和掠夺着拉丁美洲各国人民。但是，这里已经再也不是美国殖民者的平静的屋后花园了。拉丁美洲人民总有一天要把殖民者从后花园里扔出去，并且这样的一天已经不很遥远了！”
    巴西代表佩雷拉说：“美帝国主义者过去可以像猪猡一样任意闯进我们的花园，任意践踏拉丁美洲人民精心栽培的果实。现在，觉醒了的人民要自己享受自己的果实，并且还要用吃剩了的果核回敬美帝国主义者。”
    拉丁美洲的和平战士们这种胜利的信心是完全有根据的。在这东风压倒西风的时代里，从加勒比海到合恩角，到处都燃起了反殖民主义的熊熊烈火，殖民者为所欲为的时代已经过去了，人民胜利的消息不断传来：在古巴，美国最近派遣军队前去镇压古巴人民，在古巴人民的反抗和世界舆论压力下，帝国主义不得不缩回它的魔爪。在海地，人民在7月29日粉碎了美国企图颠复海地政府的阴谋。在反殖民主义斗争取得重大胜利的委内瑞拉，人民粉碎了亲美分子组织的阴谋政变。波多黎各是被美国统治了五十九年的殖民地，那里的民族独立斗争也有了新的发展。在拉丁美洲的三个重要国家即阿根廷、巴西和智利，爱国力量已经取得了广泛的发展。拉丁美洲人民愤怒地抗议美国和英国武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，许多城市都举行了群众大会和游行示威。阿拉伯人民的正义斗争鼓舞了拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动，而拉丁美洲人民民族独立运动的发展也有力地支持着阿拉伯人民的斗争。
    六个国家的和平代表都告诉记者，在拉丁美洲，越来越广泛的阶层参加了反对他们的共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争，人们在斗争中表现了不屈不挠的斗争意志。不论工人、农民、手工业者、知识分子以至民族资产阶级，都参加了反殖民主义斗争的行列。数以万计的农民组成了人民游击队，同美帝国主义和国内反动势力进行着生死搏斗。来自古巴的一位和平战士曾经对记者说：“尽管美国殖民者及其走狗对人民争取自由和独立的斗争进行着无比残酷的镇压，但反殖民主义的烽火却越烧越旺，人民的愤怒火焰是任何反动势力所扑灭不了的！”
    在哥伦比亚，争取自由和民族独立的农民起义战争已经延续了十年。现在这个战争正在如火如荼地进行中。农民军队反对那些依赖美帝国主义侵略势力而统治着哥伦比亚的金融寡头和大地主，并且“要求立即进行土地改革”。虽然哥伦比亚当局派了十万军队镇压起义部队，但是人民的武装斗争仍然在不屈不挠地进行。
    在阿根廷，和平运动和反对殖民主义运动已经汇合在一起。今年5月在布宜诺斯艾利斯召开的阿根廷争取国际合作普遍裁军和民族独立大会就是一个有力的说明。阿根廷和平代表、放射学专家佐利拉向记者说：“为了维护和平和反对美帝国主义的侵略，阿根廷人民在任何时候都不会停止他们的斗争。”
    智利和平战士罗哈斯向记者介绍的智利人民为反对所谓“保卫民主法”和“美智军事互助协定”所进行的斗争，最生动地说明了拉丁美洲人民不屈不挠的斗争精神。智利独裁者、前总统魏地拉1948年在美国操纵下公布的“保卫民主法”，被智利人民称为是“最坏的法律”。为了废除反动的“保卫民主法”和卖国的“美智军事互助协定”，十年来智利人民进行了英勇不屈的斗争。在残酷的斗争中，许多人被捕入狱，许多人付出了生命，但十年如一日，斗争从来没有停止过。人民的血没有白流，就在不久前，反动的“保卫民主法”被废除了。罗哈斯先生在阐述这个胜利的意义时说：“这个反动法案的废除，将使智利共产党能够合法存在和进行公开活动，智利爱国民主力量将迅速壮大和发展。这个胜利也将鼓舞人们继续为废除‘美智军事互助协定’而斗争的信心。”
  美帝国主义的政治奴役和经济压榨，给富饶的拉丁美洲带来了无尽的灾难和极端的贫困。各国和平战士们向记者控诉了美国殖民者的侵略罪行，他们并且指出殖民者既然亲手种下了仇恨，他们就必定自食其果。
    和平战士们告诉记者，在过去的十年中，美国在拉丁美洲进行的重大的颠复活动就有十四次之多，在它们的指使和操纵下，无数为民族独立和和平而斗争的进步人士受到了残酷的迫害，许多人遭到逮捕和枪杀。在经济上，美国现在控制着拉丁美洲60％的石油、90％的智利铜、80％的墨西哥矿产、50％的古巴糖。美国垄断资本家从那里获得的利润是惊人的。仅从1946年到1955年的十年中，美国就从拉丁美洲榨取了七十七亿六千七百万美元。拉丁美洲人民永远不会忘记由于美帝国主义丧尽天良的压榨，使得拉丁美洲一亿九千多万人中，大多数人是住在贫民窟中。在六百多万人口的智利，竟有十万多人失业。阿根廷在最近两年内，生活费用就上升了200％以上。
    来自拉丁美洲各国的和平战士最后以坚定的语气对记者表示，虽然斗争是艰巨和曲折的，但最后胜利一定属于拉丁美洲人民！
