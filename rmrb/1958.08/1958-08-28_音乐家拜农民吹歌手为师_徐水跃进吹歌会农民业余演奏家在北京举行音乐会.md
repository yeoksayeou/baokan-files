Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The farmers of Xushui County, Hebei Province, who have created heroic deeds in production, have also demonstrated extraordinary leaping spirit in the reform of national music. On the 25th, the farmer amateur performers of the Xushui County Leap Forward Wind Music Ensemble, dressed in plain clothes and with ruddy complexions, held a rare concert for famous musicians in Beijing at the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Auditorium. Using seemingly "simple" national wind and percussion instruments, they brilliantly performed complex works like "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River," which even professional musicians had not dared to attempt.

After the performance, a forum was held. Many famous musicians expressed their gratitude in their speeches to the farmer teachers for this valuable learning opportunity and stated their willingness to work with the farmer comrades to further study and resolve some of the problems in the performance. Music experts praised the fact that these farmers, who had neither attended music schools nor understood music theory, "dared" to play so many complex and difficult-to-master pieces with these seemingly "simple" national instruments—suona, sheng, flute, drums, etc.—and played them with such vigor and skill. Many musicians had previously emphasized that the expressive power of national instruments was "limited" and difficult to express the surging of real life, but this mystery has now been solved by the farmer performers, and the musicians also excitedly said: "National instruments can unleash their power!"

Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, said in his speech that many professional music groups have made many achievements in inheriting national traditions and reforming national music in recent years, but it seems that they still lack the revolutionary drive to boldly break with conventions like the farmers. This is because the farmers urgently demand to use music to reflect their Great Leap Forward thoughts and feelings, so they dare to break through all constraints and "force" these instruments to express their new life. Liu Zhiming also said that a communist musician should combine physical and mental labor, and the amateur performers of the Xushui County Leap Forward Wind Music Ensemble have also made a good start in this regard.

### 音乐家拜农民吹歌手为师  徐水跃进吹歌会农民业余演奏家在北京举行音乐会

　　音乐家拜农民吹歌手为师
    徐水跃进吹歌会农民业余演奏家在北京举行音乐会
    据新华社26日讯　在生产上创造出英雄事迹的河北省徐水县农民，在民族音乐的革新方面也表现了不平凡的跃进气概。25日，布衣素装、面色红黑的徐水县跃进吹歌会的农民业余演奏家们，在北京中国文联礼堂为北京著名的音乐家们举行了一次罕见的音乐会。他们用看来比较“简单”的民族吹打乐器，出色地演奏了像“英雄战胜大渡河”这样连专业音乐工作者还未敢尝试的复杂作品。
    演奏以后举行了座谈会。许多著名音乐家在发言中感谢农民教师给他们这次宝贵的学习机会，并且表示愿意同农民同志们一起进一步研究解决演奏中的一些问题。音乐专家们赞不绝口的是，这些既未进过音乐学校，又不懂乐理的农民，仅仅用这些看来“简单”的民族乐器——唢呐、笙、笛、鼓等就“敢于”演奏这许多结构复杂、很难掌握的乐曲，而且奏得这样气势磅礴，技巧纯熟。不少音乐家曾经强调民族乐器的表现力“有局限性”，不易表现万马奔腾的现实生活，可是这个谜现在被农民演奏家解开了，音乐家们也兴奋地说：“民族乐器可以发挥威力了”。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在讲话中说，许多专业音乐团体几年来在继承民族传统，革新民族音乐方面做出了很多成绩，但是看来还缺乏像农民们这样大胆突破成规的革命干劲。这是因为农民迫切要求用音乐来反映自己大跃进的思想情感，所以敢于突破一切束缚，“强迫”这些乐器来表现自己新的生活。刘芝明还说，共产主义的音乐家应当是体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的，徐水县跃进吹歌会的业余演奏家们在这方面也做出了一个良好的开端。（附图片）
