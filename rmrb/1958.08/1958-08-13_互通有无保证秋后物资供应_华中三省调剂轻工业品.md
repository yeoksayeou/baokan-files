Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th – The industry and commerce departments of Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces recently held a light industrial product collaboration meeting in Changsha. They unified arrangements for the supply of materials for the peak autumn season market, studied new problems that have emerged in the operation of daily-use industrial products, and conducted detailed research on balancing and promoting the further consolidation and development of local industries.

The delegations from the three provinces signed an agreement at the meeting to mutually support each other with a total of 52 types of goods (major categories). For goods in short supply, regions that produce them will support regions that do not. For example, Hunan Province will support Henan with 700 sewing machines and Hubei with 300 sewing machines. Hubei Province supplied 10,000 boxes of Sulfanilamide powder for external use, which Hunan Province does not produce. Regarding goods that are overstocked in other provinces but can be sold in one’s own province with active promotion, the spirit of mutual support was also adopted to assist in sales. For example, Henan and Hunan designated relevant business authorities to help promote the sale of Hubei Province's medicated soap and carbon paper. In addition, adjustments were made in terms of commodity patterns and varieties. For example, Henan lacked high- and medium-grade towels and socks, so Hunan and Hubei supplied 220,000 dozens. Hubei Province had a large stock of colored cloth but lacked printed cloth, while Hunan had a surplus of printed cloth and a shortage of colored cloth. The two provinces exchanged 15 types, totaling more than 1.44 million meters.

This collaboration meeting laid a good foundation for the three provinces to exchange information in the future and further develop long-term and more extensive collaboration. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that due to differences in resource conditions, production equipment, technical conditions, and consumption habits among the provinces in the development of light industrial production, close collaboration and strengthened ties are needed. They requested that this mutual collaboration be established as a regular system, with meetings held in rotation in the three provinces, so as to more rationally promote production development and meet the needs of the people's lives.

　　互通有无保证秋后物资供应
　　华中三省调剂轻工业品
    据新华社长沙12日电　河南、湖北、湖南三省的工业厅和商业厅最近在长沙举行了轻工业产品协作会议，统一安排了秋后旺季市场的物资供应，研究了日用工业品经营中出现的新问题，对平衡和促进地方工业的进一步巩固和发展，也作了详细的研究。
    三省代表团在会上签订了协议书，互相支援的商品共有五十二种
  （大类）。对于供应紧张的商品，有生产的地区支援没有生产的地区。如缝纫机，湖南省支援河南七百台，支援湖北三百台；湖南没有生产的外用磺胺粉，湖北支援了一万盒。对别省积存过多，而本省只要积极推销就可售出的商品，也本着互相支援的精神帮助推销。如湖北省的药皂、复写纸，河南、湖南都指定有关业务主管部门帮助推销一部分。此外在商品花色品种方面也作了调剂，如河南缺少高、中档毛巾和袜子，湖南、湖北就供给了二十二万打。湖北省存有大批的色布而缺少花布，湖南则花布有余而色布不足，两省互相调配了十五种共一百四十四万多公尺。
    这次协作会议，为三省今后互通情报，进一步开展长期的更广泛的协作，奠定了良好的基础。到会代表一致认为，三省目前在发展轻工业生产方面，由于资源条件、生产设备、技术条件以及各省消费习惯的不同，都需要密切协作，加强联系。他们要求把这种相互协作固定为经常的制度，在三省轮流召开，以便更合理地进一步促进生产的发展，满足人民生活的需要。
