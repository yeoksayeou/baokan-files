　　Suggestion to Publish "Farmers' Proverbs"
    Our people have rich production experience and practical knowledge regarding agricultural seasons, soil and fertilizers, cultivation methods, crop breeding and cultivation, farmland water conservancy, and pest and disease control. Apart from the relatively complete Chinese agricultural books "Qi Min Yao Shu" and "Fan Shengzhi Shu," this production knowledge and experience is mostly scattered in farmers' proverbs passed down orally. Local farmers' proverbs are agricultural books written by farmers themselves throughout the generations, and are a treasure trove of agricultural scientific knowledge in our country. If we can comprehensively and systematically sort out and study the farmers' proverbs from all over the country, and annotate them with modern scientific knowledge, we can compile an outstanding Chinese agricultural book.

    Since liberation, many new farmers' proverbs have emerged in our rural areas during various large-scale production movements. This part of the farmers' proverbs has even more new epochal significance. I also hope that they can be sorted out and published.

### 建议出版“农谚”

　　建议出版“农谚”
    我国人民对农事的时令、土壤和肥料、耕作方法、作物育种和栽培、农田水利、病虫害的防治等都有着丰富的生产经验和实践知识，这些生产知识和经验除了我国较完整的农书“齐民要术”和“泛胜之书”以外，大都分散于农民口头流传的农谚中。各地的农谚是我国历代农民自己写出的农书，是我国农业科学知识的一个宝藏，如果能把全国各地的农谚全面地系统地加以整理和研究，并且用现代科学知识注释出来，就可以编成一部出色的中国农书。
    解放以后，我国农村在各项大生产运动中又涌现出许多新的农谚。这一部分农谚就更有新的时代意义。也希望能整理出版。
