The "High Speed" of Newspaper Work
　　Zhong Huai
    I was very excited after reading the experience of the leap forward in the Shanxi Daily (see page 4 of yesterday's newspaper). Because we saw the "high speed" of newspaper work from here.
    In today's great leap forward in all aspects of the national economy, culture, and politics, newspaper work must also undergo a great revolution and a great leap forward. Because our newspapers are propaganda tools for implementing the Party's policies, reflecting reality, and guiding practical work, all the organizational and propaganda work of newspapers must be closely integrated with the current ideological, political, and economic dynamics, and must breathe and be closely related to the activities of the masses. It is impossible to imagine that when the editorial department is content with the status quo, lacks drive, and is stagnant, the newspaper can fully reflect our era of "one day equals twenty years" which is full of boiling life, heroic figures, and mythical miracles.
    The editorial board of the Shanxi Daily saw this point clearly. They believed that without a leap forward in the internal work of the newspaper, it would be difficult to report on the Great Leap Forward movement well. Therefore, based on the Marxist principle that educators must first be educated and that to transform the objective world, one must transform the subjective world, they adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously grasped ideological and political work, and infiltrated ideological work into business. As a result, everyone's thinking was liberated, their enthusiasm increased, their confidence was enhanced, a leap forward after another leap forward appeared in their work, and the content and form of the newspaper underwent tremendous changes. Putting politics in command is the basic principle for doing all work well. The editorial department of a newspaper, on the one hand, bears the heavy responsibility of ideological and political work and is a highly political work department. On the other hand, many newspaper editorial departments are places where "scholars" are piled up, and many of the editors and reporters lack practical work experience and arduous revolutionary training. To organize this team and do a good job of arduous and arduous propaganda and reporting work, we cannot do without the guiding principle of putting politics in command. This is precisely the most important experience of the leap forward in the work of the Shanxi Daily editorial department.
    Another very valuable aspect of the Shanxi Daily's experience is the firm implementation of the mass line and the vigorous promotion of mass movements. The practice of the Shanxi Daily proves that mass movements can be carried out in leading newspapers. Just as mass movements in industrial and mining enterprises can produce more steel, coal, and oil, mass movements in newspaper offices can also produce more commentaries, news, columns... The Shanxi Daily had to publish 30 editorials every month, and it was originally worried that it would not be able to complete them. After adopting the mass line policy of "everyone proposes topics, everyone writes commentaries," there were so many commentaries that they could not be squeezed in, and the quality was also improved. Other new atmospheres are also related to fully mobilizing the masses and mobilizing people's enthusiasm. Originally, organizing mass movements is a long-tested working method for the Party to rely on and mobilize the masses. It can be said that as long as there are masses, mass movements can be organized; as long as there are differences between advanced and backward, and the results of the work can be compared in terms of quantity and quality, mass competitions can be organized. Only by carrying out mass movements and organizing socialist competitions can there be a relatively high speed. On this issue, the "special theory" is also completely untenable.
    Of course, the experience of the leap forward in the Shanxi Daily is very rich. For example, it is also very important for everyone to be a "versatile player." What is mentioned above are only the two points that we think are the most enlightening. I hope that newspapers in various places will attach importance to and learn from the experience of the Shanxi Daily, and create more and better experiences in combination with their own realities. Let all our newspapers hold high the red flag of revolution and leap forward and leap forward again at a speed worthy of our times!

### 报纸工作的“高速度”

　　报纸工作的“高速度”
　　钟怀
    读了山西日报的跃进经验（见昨日本报四版），很感兴奋。因为我们从这里看到了报纸工作的“高速度”。
    在全国经济、文化、政治各方面工作都在大跃进的今天，报纸工作也必须有一番大革命大跃进。因为我们的报纸是贯彻党的方针、反映实际和指导实际工作的宣传工具，报纸的全部组织工作和宣传工作，必须同当前的思想政治和经济动态密切结合，必须同群众的活动呼吸与共息息相关。不可能设想，当编辑部安于现状、干劲不足、暮气沉沉的时候，报纸却能充分反映出我们这个充满着沸腾的生活、英雄的人物和神话般的奇迹的“一天等于二十年”的时代。
    山西日报编委会看清了这一点，他们认定没有报社内部工作的跃进，就很难报道好大跃进运动，于是根据教育者必须先受教育、要改造客观世界必须改造主观世界的马克思主义的原则，坚持政治挂帅，大抓思想政治工作，并把思想工作渗透到业务中去。结果，大家的思想解放了，干劲增长了，信心提高了，工作上出现了跃进再跃进的局面，报纸的内容和形式有了巨大的变化。政治挂帅，这是作好一切工作的基本原则。报纸的编辑部，一方面担负着思想政治工作的重担，是一个政治性很强的工作部门。另一方面，很多报纸的编辑部又是“秀才”成堆的地方，其中的很多编辑记者都缺少实际工作经验和艰苦的革命锻炼，要把这支队伍组织起来，作好繁重而艰巨的宣传报道工作，更离不开政治挂帅这个方针。这也正是山西日报编辑部工作跃进的最重要的经验。
    山西日报的经验中还有一点很宝贵的地方，就是坚决贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。山西日报的做法证明了：领导报纸完全可以搞群众运动。就跟工矿企业搞群众运动可以多出钢铁、煤炭、石油一样，报社里搞群众运动也可以多出评论、消息、专栏……山西日报每月要发三十篇社论，原来耽心完不成，采取了“人人出题目，人人写评论”的群众路线方针以后，评论多得挤不上，质量也提高了。其他方面的新气象，也无一不同充分发动群众，调动了人的积极性有关。本来，组织群众运动，是党依靠群众、发动群众的久经考验的工作方法。可以说，只要有群众的地方，就可以组织群众运动；只要有先进和落后的差别，工作的成果可以从数量上质量上进行比较，就可以组织群众性的竞赛。也只有搞群众运动，组织社会主义竞赛，才可能有较高的速度。在这个问题上，“特殊论”也是完全站不住脚的。
    当然，山西日报的跃进经验内容很丰富，例如人人要当“多面手”也是很重要的一条，上面提到的，只是我们认为最有启发意义的两点。希望各地报纸都重视和学习山西日报的经验，并结合自己的实际创造出更多更好的经验。让我们所有的报纸都高高举起革命红旗，以无愧于我们时代的速度跃进，再跃进！
