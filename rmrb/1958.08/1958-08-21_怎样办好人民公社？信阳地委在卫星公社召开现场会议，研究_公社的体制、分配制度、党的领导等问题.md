How to Run People's Communes Well?
　　Xinyang Prefectural Committee Holds On-Site Meeting in Satellite Commune to Study the Commune's System, Distribution System, and Party Leadership

(Our newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch on the 20th) The Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting on the management of communes throughout the region in the Suiping Satellite People's Commune from July 29th to August 5th. The meeting focused on studying major issues such as how to consolidate people's communes and further develop production.

In this new great social transformation, Xinyang Prefecture merged its original 5,376 agricultural cooperatives into 208 large people's communes. This great change is the result of the victory of the revolution on the political and ideological fronts in Xinyang Prefecture over the past year, and the all-round great leap forward in socialist construction. This great social change has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the people in building socialism and promoted the development of productive forces, creating a new situation of victory after victory and leap forward after leap forward in Xinyang Prefecture. After the establishment of the Hero People's Commune in Queshan County, the commune members showed great enthusiasm for production. All the more than 1,000 mu of dry land in the commune were deeply plowed in a few days, and all the weeds were eliminated from autumn crops such as corn, cotton, and millet. In the Shangyou People's Commune of Pingyu County, 167 factories were established from scratch in the four months after the establishment of the commune, with a total output value of 515,000 yuan. During the establishment of the commune, they worked hard for seven days and nights to complete two medium-sized water conservancy dredging projects, each 15 li long and 40 meters wide. Now, they have started to build a large reservoir that can irrigate more than 8,000 mu of land, and have also purchased six large water pumps and established an agricultural university. With the establishment of people's communes, people's moral concepts, ideologies, and living habits have undergone tremendous changes under the training of large-scale collective labor. As a result, public canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, etc. have sprung up rapidly. At present, more than 37,000 people's canteens have been established in the region, and seven counties have basically achieved canteenization. The emergence of these new things not only changes people's thinking and the relationship between people, but also greatly promotes the great development of industrial and agricultural production, as well as the technical and cultural revolution in Xinyang Prefecture. However, the people's commune is a new subject, and a series of changes have taken place in production management, distribution system, etc., raising a series of new problems that need to be solved urgently. This is a major task facing the entire party in Xinyang Prefecture.

During the meeting, 15 comrades introduced their communes' specific experiences in solving the system, wage system, financial management, Party leadership, and other aspects at the conference, and then launched a great debate on whether the commune could be run well and how to run the commune well. Through the debate, everyone agreed that there are four major favorable conditions for running people's communes well at present: First, the correct guidelines and policies of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee are an inexhaustible source of strength for running people's communes well; Second, there are several years of experience in running cooperatives for reference; Third, there is a large number of activists who have been tempered for a long time, who can form a core backbone force that is invincible; Fourth, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses has been improved, the communist spirit is soaring, and the unprecedented bumper harvest of summer wheat and the expected autumn harvest are the ideological and material foundation for consolidating the commune.

System and Organization

Based on the principles of unified management, hierarchical management, and facilitating collective leadership to develop production, the meeting studied specific opinions on the organizational structure and system of the commune:

1. Organizational Structure: Implement the integration of township and commune, one set of institutions, one set of personnel, the township head兼社员 (concurrently a commune member), the township Party committee secretary concurrently serves as the commune Party committee secretary, the township people's congress is the commune member representative congress, and the township people's committee is the commune management committee. Under the leadership of the management committee, establish agriculture, water conservancy, forestry and animal husbandry, industry and transportation, internal affairs and labor, armed security, finance and grain, commerce, culture and health departments, as well as planning committees and scientific research institutes. Each department is under the leadership of the management committee, in charge of various business work, and establishes brigades, teams, and various professional teams under the management committee according to the needs of production.

2. Scope of Management of Communes, Brigades, and Teams: In terms of agriculture, the commune should divide several farming areas and establish farming teams based on water sources, soil quality, and other conditions, in the spirit of facilitating production and giving full play to the potential of the land. Appropriately adjust labor, animal power, and tools according to production needs. Each brigade and team shall be responsible for the management of its affiliated farming areas. In terms of industry, the scope of management should be divided according to the principles of centralized leadership, unified planning, hierarchical management, close integration of industry and agriculture, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials. All those with large investments, large labor inputs, high technology, and high returns should be managed by the commune; those that are small in investment, inconvenient to concentrate management, and can be handled by the brigade can be managed by the brigade; all matters that the team can handle and have a great promotion to agricultural production should be managed by the team. In forestry and animal husbandry, the large areas of mountains and forests and orchards owned by several brigades are managed by the commune's professional team; general mountains and forests are managed by the brigade's professional team, and small mountains and forests and trees around the village are managed by designated personnel by the team. According to the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, large ranches are managed by the commune, and small ranches are managed by the brigade. In terms of fisheries, the commune, brigade, and team should manage fish farms according to their size. In terms of sideline occupations, the team should be actively organized to develop raising pigs, rabbits, chickens, ducks, bees, and other items, and the method of distributing income or rewarding the commune and the brigade/team by composition can be adopted to appropriately encourage them to develop sideline occupations. In terms of culture and health, all regular schools are run by the commune, and amateur schools are run by the brigade or team; film teams, theaters, scientific research institutes, and larger exhibition halls and libraries are managed by the commune.

3. Management Authority of Communes, Brigades, and Teams: The commune needs to determine appropriate production targets and construction tasks for various levels of organizations and departments within the commune on an annual or quarterly basis, but various planning indicators should not be too detailed or cumbersome. There should be a certain degree of flexibility on the premise of ensuring that lower-level organizations complete or over-complete the planned targets. For example, in agricultural production, it is only necessary to determine the task of total output and the sowing area and output indicators of major crops such as wheat, rice, cotton, and oil crops. As for the sowing plots and miscellaneous grains, the production brigade or team can determine them themselves in order to give full play to the potential of the land and meet the needs of the masses. In terms of financial management, the commune should formulate a unified investment plan according to the needs of various production and construction projects, and adopt small contract systems or allocate funds and supply materials according to the plan to use and manage various funds. For example, the contract system can be implemented for relatively stable expenditure items such as office expenses, repair of small farm tools, breeding, and fertilizers; the method of supplying according to the plan can be adopted for investment projects that lack experience and are unstable, such as pesticides and industrial and agricultural infrastructure investment. In terms of labor management, the commune should uniformly formulate a labor management plan, appropriately organize the collaboration between various production brigades and production departments, and assess the daily production of various teams and factories and mines. All labor management undertakings of various teams and factories and mines are fully responsible by themselves, and the commune does not interfere too much in order to give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of each unit. At the same time, the commune should uniformly formulate different operating procedures and labor quotas for different production departments. However, with the emergence of inventions and creations, the changes in production conditions caused by the improvement of operating technology, various units are allowed to break through operating procedures and modify certain procedures that are not conducive to the development of production.

Regarding the issue of financial and trade organizational structure, everyone believes that it is not appropriate to make major changes under the current circumstances, and a transitional method should be adopted to gradually adjust. First, the commune establishes a supply and marketing department, which, under the business leadership of state-owned commerce, handles the sales of products and the supply of necessities for the entire commune. The basic mode of its business operation is to purchase and sell on behalf of state-owned commercial enterprises. The handling fee is stipulated by the state-owned commercial organs according to the principle of deducting expenses with a slight surplus. The supply and marketing department is a separate accounting unit, and the commune is responsible for its profits and losses. Its funds are first used to offset the shares previously paid by the commune members to the supply and marketing cooperatives, and the commune will make up for the shortfall. These shares will no longer be distributed. The supply and marketing department should also establish a number of stores in major brigades and remote locations to handle the supply of small daily necessities, small groceries, and production materials, so as to generally facilitate the masses. Second, the commune establishes a credit department, which, under the business leadership of the National Bank, handles commune members' deposits and the adjustment of funds for the entire commune. The credit department can accept the business of accepting savings and loans from banks entrusted by the People's Bank of China's business office. Under the leadership of the National Bank, the credit department handles non-cash settlements between the commune and other economic units and between various accounting units within the commune, and does not implement non-cash settlements for commune members. Third, the grain work remains unchanged. The commune handles its own distribution and storage of grain. Fourth, the state tax collection agency remains unchanged. After the commune is delegated as a township-level finance, it guarantees the completion of the state tax collection task according to national regulations, and the rest belongs to the commune.

Distribution System

Regarding the distribution issue of the commune, the meeting analyzed in detail the new situation after the establishment of the commune and the conditions for implementing the wage system, and determined that different distribution methods can be adopted in various places according to the situation. At present, there are three types of distribution systems in Xinyang area: one is two advance distributions a year, one final settlement; the second is fixed work points, paid according to labor; and the third is basic wage plus bonus system. These three forms have their own strengths, but the second and third are more advanced. Since the foundations of various places are different, they should be adopted according to local conditions. As for which method to implement, the masses can be allowed to discuss and choose.

The distribution method of fixed work points and payment according to labor is: first fix the remuneration that each work day should get, and then pay wages according to the work days earned by the commune members. This method has been developed on the basis of advance payment according to labor. The difference between it and advance payment according to labor is that the remuneration for labor days is fixed, and wages are paid according to the actual number of labor days worked. The implementation of this method can reduce the various troubles in accounting caused by unfixed work points; under normal circumstances, it can fix the income of commune members, facilitate the arrangement of their labor and life, and give play to the enthusiasm of commune members. However, after the implementation of this method, it is easy for the production team to have the tendency to not work or reduce work and get more wages within the contracted scope. Therefore, in addition to the commune implementing a year-round contract system or a production-based work system for the team, and the team seriously implementing quota management, attention should also be paid to the reasonableness of the quotas for agricultural, industrial, and sideline work, so as to avoid contradictions in contracting between various types of work and affect payment according to labor.

The basic wage plus bonus system is still a distribution system of remuneration according to labor in terms of wages. Its specific practice: In the distribution of the grain part, according to the state's regulations on grain retention standards, all commune members' rations are uniformly retained in the commune, and the commune issues food stamps to commune members according to the standard of fixed quantity per person. The part of the grain consumed by commune members in the canteen only requires the surrender of food stamps, and no longer requires money to purchase. The practice of basic wage plus bonus system is to divide the labor force into grades to evaluate wages, and use about 80% of the total wages as basic wages, which are paid to commune members on a monthly basis; use 20% of the total wages as bonus wages. In agriculture, the commune controls 50% of the bonus wages, the brigade 30%, and the team 20%. In industry and various economic productions, the commune controls 60% of the bonus wages, and factories, mines, and other units control 40%. The purpose of the commune's control of bonus funds is to make up for deficiencies with surpluses and adjust the imbalances between units. The bonus wages controlled by the commune, brigade, team, factory, and mine should be awarded to each unit or individual on a regular basis. At the year-end summary in the commune, collective and individual awards are issued separately according to the completion of the plan by each team and factory and mine. The production brigade divides the production team and commune members into several grades after visiting and comparing the production situation of each team every quarter, and then rewards them according to the grade. The number of people receiving bonus wages should generally account for 40% to 60% of the total number of commune members. Commune members who receive bonus wages should meet the following conditions: First, obey the leadership and work actively; Second, actively participate in production, complete or over-complete production tasks on time and with quality; Third, cherish public property and be able to fight against bad people and bad things anytime and anywhere; Fourth, have progressive thinking, work hard to study technology, and be able to promote the technical reform movement; Fifth, attend work for more than 28 days per month. Those who meet the above conditions can receive bonus wages regardless of whether they are commune cadres or commune members. For commune members who are not actively engaged in production, are passively lazy, and are absent from work without reason, they shall be criticized and educated or have a portion of their basic wages deducted according to the circumstances, and be reported to the brigade or commune for approval to reduce their wage level. When implementing the reward and punishment system, if any unit encounters extremely serious disasters, and actively carries out rescue through effective measures, thereby reducing losses, it should also be appropriately rewarded. Conversely, if losses are caused due to irresponsibility, they should be punished. At the same time, in the distribution, the method of extracting wage reserves can also be adopted, that is, deducting a part of the wages in prosperous years as reserves to solve the wage problem in lean years. The basic wage plus bonus system is simple and easy, supported by the masses, can stimulate the labor enthusiasm of commune members, improve the commune's management and management, and promote the continued leap forward development of production. A commune that implements this method should generally have: First, commune members have a strong sense of collectivism, have a high degree of socialist consciousness, and have developed the habit of consciously working; Second, production has greatly increased, economic conditions are good, production development is relatively stable, and there are sufficient reserve funds; Third, the income level of commune members is relatively high, and the average income has exceeded the living standards of well-off middle peasants.

Strengthen Party Leadership

The meeting believes that strengthening the Party's leadership over the people's commune and giving play to the Party's role as a fighting bastion is an important key to consolidating and developing the commune. Therefore, the following work needs to be done: First, improve the Party's organization. The commune should establish a Party committee, and the Party committee should absorb the main responsible cadres in the commune. The Party committee can set up a secretary and deputy secretary. In order to facilitate leadership, the Party committee sets up an organization department, a propaganda department, a disciplinary committee, and a Party committee office. The brigade establishes a general branch or branch, and the team establishes a branch or group. The establishment of organizational structures and the allocation of personnel are mainly determined according to the quantity and quality of Party members. The organizations of the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation should also be established accordingly. Second, strengthen the Party's leadership over the commune and strengthen the Party's activities among the masses. The Party committee and branch should absorb administrative responsible cadres to participate. All major matters must first be studied by the Party committee and branch, make decisions, and then assign tasks for execution. When carrying out work, Party members must follow the mass line, consult with the masses in case of trouble, and listen to the opinions of the masses. Carry out criticism and self-criticism within the Party, overcome various undesirable tendencies, carry out the struggle between the two roads, promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, establish a strong communist ideology, and make every Party member a pioneer on the production front and the cultural front. Third, strengthen the Party's construction work. After the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, a large number of activists with socialist consciousness have emerged in various aspects, creating good conditions for the development of the Party's work. In order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward, Party committees at all levels should earnestly strengthen the work of Party building, formulate Party building plans, train a group of Party building cadres, and appropriately develop a group of Party members on the premise of ensuring quality. This year, all production teams and larger factories and mines should have Party organizations. Fourth, actively train cadres. In the use of cadres, the front line should be strengthened. Large-scale communes should be equipped with county-level cadres or cadres equivalent to county-level cadres to serve as Party committee secretaries. The cadres of the brigade should generally be filled by former township chiefs, deputy township chiefs, or small cooperative directors. At the same time, the existing Red and Expert schools should be run well, experimental fields should be managed well, theoretical and cultural studies should be strengthened, and the political and theoretical level of cooperative cadres should be improved. In addition, a large number of activists who are both red and expert should be trained. These activists are required to have a clear and firm stand, have communist consciousness, have close ties with the masses, be able to study hard and delve into things, and have the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Fifth, strengthen the political and ideological education of commune members. The Party organization should always grasp the ideological trends of commune members, carry out the struggle between the two roads, carry out the struggle between the advanced and the backward, and support the advanced and commend the advanced. At the same time, it is necessary to constantly educate commune members on the relationship between the state and the collective, and between the collective and the individual, and constantly overcome the remaining capitalist ideas of commune members. At present, it is mainly to eliminate the ideological influence of right-leaning opportunists such as Pan Fusheng and Yang Jue, thoroughly implement the general line, and carry out the current affairs propaganda movement.

Several Specific Issues

In the process of building and consolidating the commune, the following points should also be noted: First, the scale of the commune should be based on the mountainous area, the plain, the water conservancy irrigation system, and the economic development trend, starting from the benefit of production, consult with the masses, it can be large or small, generally a township should have a commune, and the number of households of 5,000, 7,000, or 10,000 are all appropriate. Second, the existing public accumulation and reserve grain of each commune shall be uniformly handed over to the people's commune for management, distribution, and use, and shall not be concealed or privately divided. Third, the debts of the commune shall be cleared and repaid separately. The debts used by the small commune for production in the current year shall be repaid by the small commune. The commune which distributes it uniformly in autumn shall be repaid by the large commune. The debts belonging to capital construction and public buildings shall be repaid by the large commune. Fourth, the private plots of the commune members shall be received by the production team, and food crops or vegetables shall be planted uniformly for common consumption by the commune members. The small mountains and forests, orchards, etc. of the commune members should belong to the commune. Fifth, commune members are generally allowed to operate their household sideline occupations themselves. If commune members request to hand them over to the commune for collective management, the commune should reasonably price and recover them. In the future, commune members will still be allowed to operate a small amount of household sideline occupations.

　　怎样办好人民公社？
    信阳地委在卫星公社召开现场会议，研究公社的体制、分配制度、党的领导等问题
    本报郑州20日电  中共信阳地委于7月29日到8月5日，在遂平卫星人民公社召开了全区公社经营管理现场会议。会上着重研究了怎样巩固人民公社和进一步发展生产等重大问题。
    信阳地区在这次新的伟大的社会变革中，由原有的五千三百七十六个农业合作社，合并建成二百零八个大型人民公社。这个伟大的变化，是信阳地区一年来政治战线和思想战线的革命的胜利和社会主义建设全面大跃进的结果。而这个伟大的社会变革，它更加激发了人们建设社会主义的积极性，推动了生产力的发展，使信阳地区出现了一个胜利再胜利、跃进再跃进的新形势。确山县英雄人民公社，建社后社员生产劲头特别大，全社一千多亩旱垡地在几天的时间内全部深翻了一遍，所有的玉米、棉花、谷子等秋作物全部消灭了杂草。平舆县上游人民公社，在公社建立后的四个月中，白手起家办了一百六十七个工厂，总产值达五十一万五千元；在建社期间苦干七昼夜，完成了十五华里长四十公尺宽的中型水利疏浚工程两处，现又动工修起了可灌溉八千余亩土地面积的大水库一座，还购买了大型抽水机六部，并办起了一所农业大学。随着人民公社的成立，人们在大规模集体劳动的锻炼下，道德观念、意识形态、生活习惯都发生了巨大的变化。因而，公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组等都风起云涌地发展了起来。目前，全区仅人民食堂一项就建立了三万七千多个，有七个县已基本实现了食堂化。这些新生事物的产生，不仅改变着人们的思想意识和人与人之间的关系，同时，大大促进了信阳地区工农业生产以及技术和文化革命的大发展。但是，人民公社是个新的课题，在生产管理、分配制度等方面都引起了一系列的变化，提出了一系列的亟待解决的新问题。这是摆在信阳地区全党面前的重大任务。
    会议期间，有十五位同志在大会上分别介绍了他们公社在解决体制、工资制、财务管理、党的领导等方面的具体经验，接着开展了能不能办好公社，如何办好公社的大鸣大放大辩论。通过辩论，大家一致认为，目前办好人民公社有四大有利条件：第一，党中央、省委的正确方针和政策，是办好人民公社无穷无尽的力量源泉；第二，有几年来办社的经验可供参考；第三，有久经锻炼的大批积极分子，可组成一个攻无不克、战无不胜的核心骨干力量；第四，广大群众的社会主义觉悟提高，共产主义精神高涨，夏季小麦空前大丰收和秋季丰收在望，这是巩固公社的思想与物质基础。
    体制和机构
    会议根据统一经营、分级管理和便于集体领导发展生产的原则，研究出公社组织机构和体制问题的具体意见：
    一、组织机构方面：实行乡社合一，一套机构，一套人马，乡长兼社员，乡党委书记兼社党委书记，乡人民代表大会就是社员代表大会，乡人民委员会就是社管理委员会。在管理委员会的领导下，设立农业、水利、林牧、工业交通、内务劳动、武装保卫、财政粮食、商业、文化卫生等部门，以及计划委员会和科学研究所等。各部门在管理委员会领导下，分管各项业务工作并根据生产的需要在管理委员会下边设立大队和小队以及各种不同的专业队。
    二、公社、大队、小队管理范围：在农业方面，公社应本着便利生产，充分发挥土地潜力的精神，根据水源、土质等条件，划分若干耕作区，建立耕作队；并根据生产需要，适当地调整劳力、畜力、工具等，各大队和小队要负责所属耕作区的管理责任。在工业方面，应根据集中领导，统一规划，分级管理，工农业密切结合，因地制宜，就地取材的原则划分管理范围。凡属投资大，用工多、技术高，收益多的，应归公社管理；凡属投资小，不便集中经营而大队又办得了的，可由大队管理；凡是小队可以办而且对农业生产有很大促进的事项，均应交小队管理。在林业和畜牧上，凡是几个大队公有的大片山林和果园，由公社组织专业队管理；一般山林由大队组织专业组管理，小片山林和四旁树木由小队确定专人管理。并根据农、林、牧相结合的方针，大牧场由社管理，小牧场由大队管理。在渔业方面，也应根据鱼场的大、中、小由公社、大队、小队分别管理。在副业方面，应积极组织小队发展养猪、兔、鸡、鸭、蜜蜂等事项，并可采取公社与大队、小队按成分配收益或奖励的办法，适当鼓励他们发展副业的积极性。在文化卫生方面，凡是属于正规的学校由社办理，业余性的学校由大队或小队办理；电影队、剧院、科学研究所和较大的展览馆、图书馆由社管理。
    三、公社、大队、小队的管理职权：公社对社内各级组织和部门需要按年按季确定适当生产指标和建设任务，但各种计划指标不应过细过繁，在使下级组织保证完成或超额完成计划指标的前提下，有一定的机动性。例如在农业生产上只要确定总产量的任务和麦、稻、棉花、油料等主要作物的播种面积和产量指标即可，至于播种地块和小杂粮等，即可由生产大队或小队自己确定，以便充分发挥土地的潜力和适应群众生活的需要。在财务管理方面，公社应根据各种生产建设的需要，统一制定投资计划，分别不同情况采用小包干或按计划拨款和供应物资等办法，来进行各种资金的使用和管理。例如对办公费、小农具的修理、饲养、化肥等较稳定的开支项目，可实行包干制；对杀虫药剂、工农业基本建设投资等缺乏经验和不稳定的投资项目，可采取按计划供应的办法。在劳动管理方面，由社统一制定劳动管理计划，适当组织各生产大队和生产部门之间的协作，考核各队和厂矿的日常生产。凡各队和厂矿的劳动管理事业，都由他们自己全权负责，公社不作过多的干涉，以便发挥各单位的主动性和积极性。同时，公社应分别不同生产部门，统一制定不同操作规程和劳动定额，但随着发明创造的出现，操作技术的提高所引起的生产情况的变化，允许各单位突破操作规程和修改某些不利于发展生产的规程。
    关于财贸组织机构问题，大家认为在目前情况下不宜大动，应当采取过渡的办法逐步进行调整。第一，公社设立供销部，在国营商业的业务领导下，办理全社的产品销售与必需品的供应，其经营业务的基本方式是给国营商业代购代销。手续费按照扣除开支略有盈余的原则，由国营商业机关规定。供销部是单独核算单位，盈亏由公社统一负责，它的资金先由社员过去所交纳供销社股金抵充，不足部分由公社补足，这些股金不再分红。供销部还要在各大队和偏远的地点建立若干门市部，办理小日用百货、小杂货、生产资料的供应，作到普遍便利群众。第二，公社设立信用部，在国家银行的业务领导下，办理社员存款和全社的资金调剂等工作。信用部可以接受人民银行营业所委托代理银行储蓄放款等业务。在国家银行的领导下，信用部办理公社与其它经济单位之间以及公社内部各核算单位之间的非现金结算，对社员不实行非现金结算。第三，粮食工作维持现状，不变动。公社粮食分发、保管等工作由社自理。第四，国家税收机构不变动，公社作为乡的一级财政下放后，按国家规定保证完成国家税收任务，其余归公社所有。
    分配制度
    关于公社的分配问题，会议详细地分析了建立公社后的新形势与实行工资制的条件，并确定各地根据情况可采取不同的分配办法。目前，信阳地区的分配制度有三种方式：一是一年两次预分，一次决算；二是固定工值，按劳付资；三是基本工资加奖励制。这三种形式各有所长，但以第二、第三两种较先进。因各地基础不同，应当因地制宜采用，至于执行那一种办法，可让群众讨论选择。
    固定工值、按劳付资的分配办法是：先把每个劳动日应得的报酬固定下来，再按社员所得劳动日计发工资。这种办法是在按劳预支的基础上发展起来的。它与按劳预支的不同点，是劳动日报酬固定了，按实做劳动日发工资。实行这种办法，可以减少因工值不固定所引起核算上的种种麻烦；在一般的情况下，能使社员的收入固定下来，便于安排自己的投工和生活，发挥社员的劳动积极性。但是，实行这种办法后，容易使生产队在包工以内发生该投工而不投工或减少投工、多得工资的偏向。因此，除社对队执行常年包工制或以产定工制，队内认真执行定额管理外，还要注意农业、工业和副业各项用工的定额合理，以免各工种之间包工发生矛盾，影响按劳付资。
    基本工资加奖励制，在工资方面还是按劳取酬的分配制度。它的具体作法：在粮食部分的分配上，是根据国家规定的留粮标准，社内将所有社员口粮统一留在社内，社按以人定量的标准发给社员食粮证，社员在食堂所食用的粮食部分只交粮证，不再拿钱购买。基本工资加奖励制的作法，是把劳动力分级评定工资，以工资总数80％左右作为基本工资，按月发给社员；以工资总数的20％作为奖励工资。在农业上，社掌握奖励工资50％，大队30％，小队20％。在工业和多种经济生产上，社掌握奖励工资60％，厂、矿等单位掌握40％。公社掌握奖励资金的目的，在于以丰补歉，调剂各单位之间的不平衡现象。公社、大队、小队和厂、矿掌握的奖励工资应当定期奖给各单位或个人。社内年终总结时，按照各队和厂、矿完成计划的情况，分别发集体奖和个人奖。生产大队根据每个季度各小队生产情况，经过参观评比，将生产小队和社员个人分成若干等，然后按等奖励。领取奖励工资的人数，一般要占社员总数的40％到60％。领取奖励工资的社员，应当具备以下条件：一、服从领导，积极工作；二、积极参加生产，按时按质完成或超额完成生产任务；三、爱护公共财产，随时随地能与坏人坏事进行斗争；四、思想进步，努力钻研技术，并能推动技术改革运动；五、每月出勤在二十八天以上。合乎上述条件者，不论社干、社员均可领取奖励工资。对于不积极生产、消极怠工和无故缺勤的社员，根据情节予以批评教育或扣发一部分基本工资，并报大队或社批准，降低工资级别。在执行奖惩制度时，不论任何单位，如果遇到极为严重的灾害时，经过采取有力措施，积极进行抢救，因而减少损失者，还应予以适当奖励。反之，如果因不负责任造成损失，应当予以处分。同时，在分配中，还可采用提取工资底垫的办法，即是在丰收年景扣下一部分工资作为底垫，以备歉年解决工资问题。基本工资加奖励制，方法简便，群众拥护，可以激发社员的劳动积极性，改进社的经营管理，推动生产继续飞跃发展。实行这种办法的社一般应当具备：一，社员集体观念强，有高度的社会主义觉悟，已养成自觉劳动的习惯；二，生产大大增加，经济条件好，生产发展比较稳定，有充足的后备资金；三，社员收入水平较高，平均收入已经超过富裕中农生活水平。
    加强党的领导
    会议认为，加强党对人民公社的领导，发挥党的战斗堡垒作用，是巩固和发展公社的重要关键。因此，需要做好以下工作：一、健全党的组织，公社要建立党委会，党委会应当吸收社内的主要负责干部参加。党委会可设书记、副书记。为了便于领导，党委会下设组织部、宣传部、监委会、党委办公室。大队设立总支或支部，小队建立支部或小组。组织机构的建立和人员的配备，主要根据党员数量质量决定。团和妇联的组织，也应相应的建立起来。二、加强党对社的领导，加强党在群众中的活动。党的委员会和支部，要吸收行政负责干部参加，一切重大事情，必须首先经过党委会和支部的研究，作出决定，再分工执行。党员在进行工作时，一定要走群众路线，遇事和群众商量，听取群众意见。在党内经常开展批评与自我批评，克服各种不良倾向，开展两条道路的斗争，兴无灭资，树立坚强的共产主义思想，使每个党员都能成为生产战线上和文化战线上的先锋。三、加强党的建设工作。经过政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，各方面都涌现出大批具有社会主义觉悟的积极分子，为发展党的工作创造了良好条件。为了适应大跃进的形势需要，各级党委应切实加强建党工作，都要制订建党计划，训练一批建党干部，在保证质量的条件下，适当发展一批党员，今年要使所有生产队和较大的厂矿都有党的组织。四、积极培养干部。在干部使用上，要加强第一线。大型公社，应配备县委一级干部或相当县委一级的干部任党委书记；大队的干部一般要有过去小乡乡长、副乡长或小社社长充任。同时，要办好现有的红专学校，搞好试验田，加强理论和文化学习，提高社干政治理论水平。此外，要大量培养又红又专的积极分子。要求这些积极分子立场明确坚定，有共产主义觉悟，和群众有密切联系，能苦学苦钻，具有敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。五、加强对社员的政治思想教育工作。党的组织要经常掌握社员思想动向，开展两条道路的斗争，开展先进与落后的斗争，支持先进，表扬先进。同时，要经常对社员进行国家与集体、集体与个人三者之间的关系的教育，不断克服社员的资本主义思想残余。目前，主要是肃清潘复生、杨珏等右倾机会主义分子的思想影响，深入贯彻总路线，开展时事宣传运动。
    几个具体问题
    在建社和巩固社的过程中，还要注意以下几点：一、公社的规模应根据山区、平原、水利灌溉系统、经济发展趋势，从有利于生产出发，同群众商量，可大则大，可小则小，一般应一乡一社，户数五千、七千、一万户均为适宜。二、各社现有的公共积累、储备粮，统一上缴人民公社管理和分配使用，不准隐瞒和私分。三、公社债务要分别清理偿还，属于小社用于当年生产的债务，由小社归还，秋季统一分配的社由大社归还，属于基本建设、公共建筑的债务，一律由大社归还。四、社员的自留地，由生产队接收，统一种植粮食作物或蔬菜，社员共同消费。社员的小片山林、果木园等，应归社所有。五、社员的家庭副业一般允许社员自己经营，如社员要求交社集体经营时，社应合理作价收回，今后仍允许社员经营小量的家庭副业。
