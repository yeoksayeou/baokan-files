Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Royal Highness, friends, comrades:

We are very pleased with the warm and friendly speech made by Your Royal Highness just now. Your Royal Highness has expressed particular concern and appreciation for the peaceful construction work of the Chinese people, which is a great encouragement to the Chinese people. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks.

The friendly relations between China and Cambodia have a long tradition. According to Chinese historical records, as early as 1,700 years ago, that is, in the third century AD, the people of China and Cambodia had contact. Since then, envoys from the two countries have traveled back and forth continuously, leaving behind many beautiful and friendly records. As Your Royal Highness said, the frequent and close exchanges between China and Cambodia have always been based on friendship and a desire to understand each other. Although the scourge of modern colonialism interrupted the connection between our two countries for about a century, in recent years, the traditional friendship between our two countries has not only been restored on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but has also seen new and great development. In particular, with the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries and Your Royal Highness's friendly visit to China once again, the friendship between the two countries has entered a new stage. The joint statement signed by both sides this afternoon further illustrates that although our two countries have different social systems, we understand and respect each other. Therefore, we can fully support and cooperate with each other in developing bilateral relations and maintaining world peace. The Chinese people are very satisfied and happy with the revival and prosperity of the traditional friendship between China and Cambodia.

The smooth development of Sino-Cambodian relations is not only due to the existence of traditional friendship, but more importantly, because our two countries strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, especially the principles of equality between large and small countries and the right of all peoples to choose their own social systems. Your Royal Highness often says that Cambodia is not a big country. However, Cambodia resolutely safeguards its national independence, pursues a policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs, defends peace, and advocates justice, which is even more worthy of respect. Moreover, its position of upholding justice is fundamentally incomparable to the misdeeds of some big countries. Therefore, Cambodia enjoys a high reputation in the international community. China fully respects and firmly supports the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by Cambodia. However, some big countries take a completely different attitude towards countries smaller than themselves. They style themselves as the "protectors" of small countries, but in reality, they brutally infringe upon the independence and sovereignty of small countries. Lebanon and Jordan are being subjected to armed aggression under the guise of being "protected." Because Cambodia refuses to be "protected," it is often subjected to various pressures from colonial powers, including the encroachment and blockade of Cambodian territory by Cambodia's neighbors under the direction of colonial powers. China strongly condemns the bullying and aggression of big countries against small countries, and hopes that Asian and African countries will be highly vigilant against the colonialist countries' practice of instigating divisions in the Asian and African regions in order to divide and rule.

However, today is no longer an era in which colonialist countries can act lawlessly. The emergency special session of the UN General Assembly, which adjourned a few days ago, reflects the characteristics of our era. At this meeting, the voices for peace and safeguarding national independence prevailed, and a resolution was passed for the early withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Although this resolution does not fully reflect the wishes and demands of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, it shows that the united Arab countries, with the support of socialist and nationalist countries, can thwart the attempts of the United States and Britain to evade troop withdrawal and interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries. All peace-loving countries and peoples in the world should continue to persist in their struggle under the inspiration of this victory, so that the resolutions of the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly can be implemented quickly and effectively, and to prevent any delays in the withdrawal of troops by the United States and Britain.

When talking about the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly, I would like to thank Cambodia and other friendly countries on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people for upholding justice and reserving the request for the restoration of China's representation in the United Nations at this meeting. Although the United States continues to obstruct China from obtaining its due legitimate status in the United Nations, the entire process of this emergency special session of the UN General Assembly shows that the situation in which the United States completely controls the United Nations is changing.

In the relationship between China and Cambodia, just as in the relationship between China and some other Southeast Asian countries, the issue of overseas Chinese is a rather important issue. The Chinese government has always, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, encouraged overseas Chinese to abide by the laws and respect the customs of their country of residence, advised them not to participate in the political activities of their country of residence, and mobilized them to contribute to the economic development of their country of residence. However, some countries, in order to alienate the relations between China and Southeast Asian countries and undermine China's international prestige, have constantly spread the lie that China is using overseas Chinese to carry out subversive activities. Facts have proved that the vast majority of overseas Chinese residing in Southeast Asian countries are getting along with the people of their country of residence in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese government, while the United States is colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, using a very small number of dregs among the overseas Chinese to carry out various conspiracies to harm Southeast Asian countries. The fact that the United States instigated Chiang Kai-shek elements residing in Indonesia to openly support the Indonesian rebel group is an example of this kind of conspiracy. The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique also interfere in the internal affairs of some Southeast Asian countries in a more covert way, through individual overseas Chinese dregs, using the method of buying with money. We are pleased to see that the governments of China and Cambodia have shown full mutual respect and mutual trust on the issue of overseas Chinese. The fact that those who sow discord cannot have any influence at all is another concrete manifestation of Sino-Cambodian friendship.

Your Royal Highness's visit to China is about to end soon. We can say with certainty that Your Royal Highness's visit has further strengthened mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia. During the visit, Your Royal Highness's concern and encouragement for China's construction undertakings has made us realize the deep friendship of the Cambodian people towards the Chinese people. We ask Your Royal Highness to take back the love of the Chinese people to the Cambodian people, and hope that there will be more opportunities to welcome Your Royal Highness to visit China in the future.

I propose:

For the close friendship between the people of China and Cambodia,
For the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa,
For world peace,
For the health of His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit and Her Majesty the Queen of Cambodia,
For the health of the host of today's banquet, a good friend of the Chinese people, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
Cheers!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

1958-08-25
第4版()
专栏：

　　周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的亲王殿下，朋友们，同志们：
    刚才亲王殿下热情而友好的讲话使我们感到非常高兴。亲王殿下特别对中国人民的和平建设工作表示了关怀和赞赏，这是对于中国人民的极大鼓舞，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    中国和柬埔寨的友好关系具有悠久的传统。根据中国史籍的记载，早在一千七百年以前，也就是在公元第三世纪，中柬两国人民就有了接触。从此以后，两国使者来往不绝，留下了许多美好和亲善的记录。诚如亲王殿下所说，中柬两国频繁和紧密的往来一向是在友好和希望互相了解的基础上进行的。尽管近代殖民主义的祸害曾经使我们两国的联系中断了约一个世纪，但是，最近几年来，我们两国的传统友谊在和平共处五项原则的基础上不仅得到恢复，而且有了新的很大发展。特别是，随着两国正式外交关系的建立和亲王殿下再一次对中国的友好访问，两国的友谊又进入了一个新的阶段。今天下午，我们双方签署的联合声明更充分说明，我们两国的社会制度虽然不同，但是，我们互相了解，互相尊重，因此，完全能够在发展两国关系和维护世界和平的事业中，互相支持，友好合作。对于中、柬两国传统友谊的复兴和昌盛，中国人民感到十分满意和高兴。
    中柬两国关系的顺利发展，不只是由于存在着传统的友谊，更重要的是由于我们两国严格地遵守和平共处的五项原则，特别是关于大小国家平等相待和各国人民有权选择自己的社会制度的原则。亲王殿下常常说，柬埔寨不是一个大国。但是，柬埔寨却坚决维护自己的民族独立，在国际事务中执行和平中立的政策，保卫和平，主张正义，这就更加值得尊重。而且，它这种坚持正义的立场，比起某些大国的多行不义，根本不能同日而语，因此柬埔寨在国际上享有很高的声誉。中国完全尊重并且坚决支持柬埔寨所奉行的和平中立政策。但是，某些大国却采取完全不同的态度来对待比它们较小的国家。它们自封为小国的“保护者”，实际上却粗暴地侵犯小国的独立和主权。黎巴嫩和约旦正是在被“保护”的名义下遭到武装侵略。柬埔寨由于拒绝被“保护”，也经常受到殖民大国施加的种种压力，其中包括柬埔寨邻邦在殖民大国的指使下对柬埔寨领土所进行的侵犯和封锁。中国强烈地谴责大国对小国的欺压和侵略，并且希望亚非各国严重地警惕殖民主义国家在亚非地区进行挑拨以便分而治之的做法。
    但是，今天究竟已经不是殖民主义国家可以横行不法的时代了。几天以前休会的联大紧急特别会议反映了我们这个时代的特点。在这次会议上，争取和平和维护民族独立的呼声占了优势，并且通过了外国军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议。这个决议虽然还没有完全反映世界爱好和平的国家和人民的愿望和要求，但是它却表明，取得一致的阿拉伯各国，在社会主义国家和民族主义国家的支持下，是可以挫败美国和英国规避撤兵和干涉阿拉伯各国内政的企图的。世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民在这次胜利的鼓舞下，应该继续坚持斗争，使联大紧急特别会议的决议得到迅速而切实的实施，防止美国和英国对于撤军的任何拖延。
    在谈到联大紧急特别会议的时候，我愿意代表中国政府和中国人民感谢柬埔寨和其他友好国家在这次会议上主张正义，保留恢复中国在联合国代表权的要求。尽管美国继续阻挠中国在联合国中取得应有的合法地位，但是，这次联大紧急特别会议的整个过程说明，美国完全控制联合国的形势正在起着变化。
    在中国和柬埔寨的关系中，正像在中国和其他一些东南亚国家的关系中一样，华侨问题是一个相当重要的问题。中国政府一向根据和平共处的五项原则，勉励华侨遵守侨居国的法令和尊重侨居国人民的习惯，劝告他们不参加侨居国的政治活动，并且动员他们为侨居国的经济发展作出贡献。但是，有些国家为了离间中国和东南亚国家的关系，破坏中国的国际威信，却不断散布所谓中国利用华侨进行颠复活动的谎言。事实证明，侨居在东南亚各国的绝大多数华侨是遵照中国政府的指示同侨居国人民友好相处的，而美国却勾结蒋介石集团，利用华侨中极少数的败类，进行种种危害东南亚各国的阴谋活动。美国指使居住在印度尼西亚的蒋帮分子公开支持印度尼西亚的叛乱集团，就是这种阴谋活动的例证。美国和蒋介石集团还以较为隐蔽的方式，通过个别华侨败类，用金钱收买的办法，干涉某些东南亚国家的内政。我们满意地看到，中柬两国政府在华侨问题上表现了充分的互相尊重和互相信任。使挑拨离间的人丝毫不能发生影响，这是中柬友谊的又一个具体表现。
    亲王殿下在中国的访问，不久就要结束。我们可以肯定地说，亲王殿下的这次访问进一步加强了中柬两国的相互了解和友好合作。在访问期间，亲王殿下对中国建设事业的关怀和鼓励，使我们体会到柬埔寨人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。我们请亲王殿下把中国人民的热爱带回给柬埔寨人民，并且希望今后能够有更多机会欢迎亲王殿下来中国访问。
    我提议：
    为中柬两国人民之间的亲密友谊，
    为亚非各国人民的团结，
    为世界的和平，
    为柬埔寨王国国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特陛下和王后陛下的健康，
    为今天宴会的主人、中国人民的好朋友，诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下的健康，
    干杯！
