　　Young People Can Also Accomplish Great Things
    (Reported by this newspaper) Harbin No. 19 Middle School, after breaking down the conservative idea that "young people cannot accomplish great things," has adopted the mass line method of combining with factories, students' families, and teachers' families, and has established dozens of factories in the past half month.
    Since Harbin No. 19 Middle School started its work-study program, it has only established two factories. The large-scale establishment of factories began in early July, when the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on schools to establish factories on a large scale. This school adopted measures to combine the school with factories, students' families, and teachers' families, so that the difficulties encountered by students in running factories, such as the lack of production equipment, production technology, raw materials, factory buildings, and sales channels, could be quickly resolved.
    The joint establishment of factories by schools and factories is a good way for factories to expand production capacity and for schools to carry out labor education. The iron and steel plant established by this school in conjunction with the Harbin Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory is responsible for everything from equipment and raw materials to technology and sales. The school will produce various cast iron parts for this factory. This approach is equivalent to the factory adding a small sand casting workshop. The state-owned Harbin Electric Machinery Factory is supplying equipment and raw materials to help this school establish an electric machinery factory to produce small motors, transformers, batteries, and other products. The design work of the textile factory and the electric machinery factory has been assisted by parents and teachers' families with design technology. Some sewing machines in the garment factory were borrowed from parents, and some factories were set up in students' homes with the consent of their parents.

　　少年也能办大事
    本报讯　哈尔滨市第十九中学，破除“少年不能办大事”的保守思想后，采取与工厂结合、与学生家庭和教师家属结合的群众路线的方法，在最近的半个月里办起了数十个工厂。
    哈尔滨市第十九中学勤工俭学以来只办了两个工厂。大办工厂是从7月初，中共哈尔滨市委号召学校大办工厂开始的。这个学校采取学校与工厂与学生家庭与教师家属结合的措施，使学生在办工厂中遇到的无生产设备、无生产技术、无原材料、无厂房、无销路等困难得到迅速地解决。
    学校与工厂结合兴办工厂，是工厂扩大生产能力、学校进行劳动教育的好办法。这个学校与哈尔滨松花江农业机械厂结合兴办的炼铁厂，从设备、原料到技术、销路都由这个工厂负责。学校将为这个厂生产各种生铁铸件。这种作法就等于这个厂增加了一个小型的翻砂车间。国营哈尔滨电机厂，正在供给设备、原材料，帮助这个学校兴办电机厂，生产小型电机、变压器、电池等产品。纺织厂和电机厂的设计工作，得到了有设计技术的学生家长和教师家属的帮助。有的服装厂的缝纫机是家长借给的，还有的工厂是取得家长的同意设在学生家里的。　　　　　　　（孙若刚）
