　　The Korean People Ride the Chollima
　　—Introducing the Measures and Drive of the Korean People in Construction
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang

　　The Korean people, with heroic spirit, put forward the grand task of "further consolidating the socialist economic foundation of the northern part of the Republic and basically solving the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the people" in the first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961). Now, the economic plan for the first year of the Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled, and a new upsurge has formed in all sectors of the national economy. As Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out, the task of basically solving the people's food, clothing, and housing problems is being rapidly and gradually realized through systematic increases in accumulation.

　　Economic Conditions Exist, Mass力量Mobilized

　　As people know, during the Korean War, cities and some rural areas in northern Korea were turned into ruins by the brutal bombing of the American imperialists. A total of more than 8,700 factories and workshops, 28 million square meters of housing, and 5,000 schools were destroyed, and the people's lives were severely devastated. Under these circumstances, it is astonishing that the Korean people, after only five years of post-war construction, put forward the slogan of "basically solving the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the people." However, the Korean people are confidently realizing it.

　　The basis of their confidence is, first of all, that the construction of the Korean people in the past few years after the war has strengthened the economic conditions for solving this problem. Due to the priority development of heavy industry, Korea itself has been able to produce and supply a large amount of production equipment needed for the future development of light industry and building materials needed for construction; the light industry system has newly built 38 factories and restored 57 factories after the war, with a considerable foundation; in addition, agriculture has increased production year by year after the war, and last year's grain output reached 3.2 million tons. Further development of agriculture can provide sufficient raw materials for light industry.

　　More importantly, the Korean Workers' Party actively mobilizes the power of the masses to solve the practical problems of the masses. After the war, the Workers' Party vigorously mobilized the masses to repair water conservancy projects, increase grain production, and solve the most pressing food problem. Now, the Workers' Party is leading the people to carry out a nationwide movement to develop the production of food and daily necessities and other necessities of life through a combination of large, medium, and small methods, and to carry out a mass housing construction movement. When the masses are mobilized, miracles are created.

　　In this way, people believe that by 1961, the Korean people will be able to basically solve the problems of food, clothing, and housing. Specifically, each person can get an average of 20 meters of textiles, 320 kilograms of grain, 65 kilograms of meat, and live in good housing each year.

　　Realizing Irrigation, From Grain Shortage to Surplus

　　Northern Korea has many mountains and few plains, and has always been a grain-deficient area. In the post-war years, the Korean people launched a large-scale water conservancy construction movement. In the past five years, the irrigated area of paddy fields in northern Korea has doubled, from 220,000 chobu to 460,000 chobu, making the proportion of irrigation of paddy fields reach 91% of the existing paddy field area. The effects of water conservancy construction and other agricultural production increase measures made agriculture achieve an unprecedented harvest last year, with grain output reaching 3.2 million tons. The farmers have proposed to produce 3.96 million tons of grain this year, completing and overfulfilling the production increase target of 3.76 million tons of grain stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan by 1961, making the food grain and industrial grain in northern Korea self-sufficient.

　　In order to increase grain production, Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized the issue of establishing dryland irrigation systems in June this year based on the experience of the masses. He requested that 1.3 million chobu out of the 2 million chobu of land in northern Korea be irrigated during the first Five-Year Plan (including 600,000 chobu of paddy fields and 700,000 chobu of dryland), making agriculture in northern Korea an agriculture that is not afraid of drought and flood and has good harvests all year round.

　　His call was warmly responded to by the farmers. During the drought this summer, most of the farmers in northern Korea started to establish dryland irrigation systems while fighting the drought. It is estimated that corn and other crops that have been irrigated can double their production.

　　Wood, Reeds, and Corn Stalks Can All Be Used as Clothing Materials

　　The textile industry in Korea, which was almost a blank slate before liberation, has made great leaps forward in the post-war years with the construction of modern textile joint enterprises such as the Pyongyang Textile Factory. This year, the output of all textiles can reach more than 100 million meters, which is nine times that of 1949 before the war, that is, each person can get more than ten meters.

　　In order to solve the problem of people's clothing, Korea will produce 200 million meters of textiles by 1961, so that each person can get an average of 20 meters. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to building large-scale textile factories and silk factories in Sinuiju and Hamhung during the Five-Year Plan, Korea has taken a practical measure, which is to develop the production of man-made fibers.

　　Northern Korea has many mountains and less cotton production. Although production has been greatly increased after the war, it is still far from meeting the needs of the development of the textile industry. In order to solve the problem of fiber raw materials, Korean scientists and workers have worked hard to research man-made fibers. Recently, they have successfully trial-produced man-made fibers from reed pulp and corn stalk pulp. A man-made fiber factory with an annual output of 20,000 tons using these two raw materials will soon be built in Sinuiju. Together with the Chongjin man-made fiber factory, which has been restored and expanded using wood pulp as raw material, Korea can produce 40,000 tons of man-made fiber annually by 1961, which can be woven into 130 million meters of textiles. The forests on the mountains, the reeds on the river beaches, and the corn stalks in the fields will all become the clothing materials of the Korean people.

　　Carry Out Nationwide Movement to Widely Produce Necessities of Life

　　The nationwide movement to produce necessities of life, combining large, medium, and small (factories, cooperatives, households), which is now being carried out according to the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party in June, is developing vigorously. Light industrial factories in Korea took the lead in participating in this movement, which focuses on expanding varieties and improving quality. Each textile factory will expand the varieties from 750 to 1,000 this year. The Yongsong Meat Canning Factory will expand from 51 kinds of meat and fruit canned food to 150 kinds. The varieties of vegetables, fish, meat and other foods produced by each handicraft production cooperative are in the hundreds.

　　The development of the daily necessities industry has been particularly rapid. Since this year, thousands of new products such as bicycles, sewing machines, and clocks have been successfully trial-produced. Large factories in various industrial systems have also set up daily necessities workshops. Steel factories use scrap iron to produce iron shovels, agricultural tools, small hardware, and small bicycles for children. Railway factories also use scrap wood to make wooden furniture.

　　"Labor News" called in an editorial to break the idea of "mystifying" running industries, and required that each county should run more than one factory, using local funds and raw materials to produce necessities of life to meet the needs of the local people. This movement is being carried out in depth.

　　In addition, during the first Five-Year Plan, Korea will build a large number of food and daily necessities factories. The Hamhung Meat Processing Factory and the Yongsong Fruit Canning Factory are among those that will be started this year. By 1961, it will be able to produce 50,000 tons of meat processed products, 200,000 tons of vegetable processed products, and the output of daily necessities will increase four times compared with 1956. And within this year, the production level of Korean light industry will reach four times that of 1949.

　　Urban and Rural Construction is Busy, New Houses are Being Built Everywhere

　　The drive and mass power of the Korean people are most clearly manifested in construction. Today, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants in Korea are all participating in construction. This spring, school flags were flying on many construction sites in Pyongyang. Students from universities and middle schools contracted to build the foundations of a building or repair a road. They all provided more than a month of labor for Pyongyang's construction, totaling more than 300,000 workdays. The cadres of Pyongyang's agencies built 3,500 houses themselves. Even the Young Pioneers built children's parks themselves by stacking stones. In addition to helping with urban and factory and mine construction, the peasants are carrying out or preparing for the construction of new villages. Everyone participates in construction, which is the guarantee for completing the housing construction plan of the first Five-Year Plan - 10 million square meters of urban housing and 200,000 rural houses.

　　It is precisely because of this mass construction movement that Pyongyang's construction has been rapidly advanced. Pyongyang, which was bombed into ruins before the war, has been built into a brand-new modern city today. The newly built Youth Road residential area, Potongmun residential area, and Apartment Road residential area are all filled with three- to six-story buildings, which even "Old Pyongyang" cannot help but marvel at. By 1960, the people of Pyongyang will be able to live in modern new houses.

　　Like Pyongyang, the various rural areas in northern Korea are also undergoing or preparing for fundamental changes. Every agricultural cooperative I have visited has a construction blueprint. They are all ready to demolish all the existing thatched houses and rebuild them into new socialist new villages during the first Five-Year Plan or the second Five-Year Plan. Some even relocate the entire village. The blueprints show neatly arranged new rural houses, nurseries, children's parks, schools, and bathhouses. The most important thing is that this is not just a beautiful ideal. Each agricultural cooperative has organized construction teams to start learning technology and preparing for construction. Recently, the realization of this ideal has been seen in the Daesong Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Pyongyang. From April to mid-August this year, the cooperative's construction team has built 100 houses. By next year, all the farmers in the cooperative will be able to bid farewell to the thatched houses they have lived in for thousands of years and move into newly built tiled houses. In the Daesong Agricultural Cooperative, we can see that there are seven standard designs for new rural houses, which can be selected by farmers according to their population and preferences, and then the construction team will build them. Because all kinds of building materials are supplied by the state, each house only costs 90,000 to 120,000 won, and the labor income of farmers who work well for two years can pay off the construction cost. The new red rural houses built by the cooperative are like a neat row of soldiers, and the glass windows are shining with golden sunlight. The head of the agricultural cooperative said that the open space in front of the house is a vegetable garden, and each household must plant four fruit trees around the house, and also raise bees and feed rabbits.... Look! Under the hardworking hands of the hardworking Korean people, a socialist paradise will be built.

　　朝鲜人民跨上了里马
　　——介绍朝鲜人民搞建设的措施和干劲
　　本报记者　王玉章
    朝鲜人民在第一个五年计划（1957年—1961年）中以豪迈的气魄提出了“进一步巩固共和国北部的社会主义经济基础，基本上解决人民的衣食住问题”的宏伟任务。现在，五年计划的头一年的经济计划已经超额完成了，各个人民经济部门已经形成了新的高潮。基本上解决人民的衣食住问题的任务，正如金日成首相所指出的，正在有系统的增加积累的基础上，迅速地逐渐地得到实现。
　　具备了经济条件　发动了群众力量
    人们都知道，在朝鲜战争中，朝鲜北部的城市和一些农村在美帝国主义者的残酷轰炸下都变成了废墟，共有八千七百多个工厂和作坊、二千八百万平方公尺的住宅和五千所学校被炸毁，人民的生活遭到严重的摧残。在这种情况下，战后仅仅建设了五年的朝鲜人民就提出了“基本上解决人民的衣食住问题”的口号，是令人惊奇的。但是，朝鲜人民却正在满怀信心地实现它。
    他们的信心的根据首先是，朝鲜人民战后几年的建设壮大了解决这个问题的经济条件。由于重工业得到优先的发展，今后发展轻工业所需要的大部分生产设备和建设需要的建筑材料，朝鲜自己已经能够大量生产供应；战后轻工业系统新建了三十八个厂，恢复了五十七个厂，具备了相当的基础；另外，农业在战后年年增产，去年粮食产量达到了三百二十万吨。农业的进一步发展又可以为轻工业提供充分的原料。
    而更重要的一点是，朝鲜劳动党积极发动群众的力量来解决群众的切身问题。战后劳动党曾经大力发动群众修水利，增产粮食，解决最迫切的粮食问题。现在劳动党又领导人民开展全民性的运动，以大中小相结合的方法发展食品和日用品等生活必需品的生产，并开展群众性的建设住宅运动。群众发动起来了，奇迹就创造出来了。
    这样一来，人们相信到1961年，朝鲜人民就能够基本上解决衣食住问题，具体地说来就是每人每年可平均分得二十公尺纺织品、三百二十公斤粮、六十五公斤肉类、住上好住宅。
    实现水利化　缺粮变余粮
    朝鲜北部山地多，平原少，向来是缺粮区。战后的年代里，朝鲜人民展开了大规模的兴修水利运动。五年来把朝鲜北部的水田灌溉面积翻了一番，从二十二万町步增加到四十六万町步，使水田的水利化比例达到现有水田面积的91％。兴修水利和其它农业增产措施的效果使去年的农业取得空前的丰收，粮食产量达到三百二十万吨。而农民们今年又提出要生产三百九十六万吨粮食，提前并超额完成第一个五年计划规定的到1961年生产三百七十六万吨粮食的增产指标，使朝鲜北部的食用粮和工业用粮自给自足。
    为了增产粮食，金日成首相在今年6月根据群众经验强调提出建立旱田灌溉系统的问题，他要求在第一个五年计划内使朝鲜北方二百万町步土地中的一百三十万町步水利化（其中六十万町步水田和七十万町步旱田），使朝鲜北部的农业成为不怕旱涝常年丰收的农业。
    他的号召得到农民们的热烈响应，今年夏天天旱时，朝鲜北部大部分农民一边抗旱一边开始建立旱田灌溉系统。经过灌溉的玉米等庄稼估计都能成倍的增产。
    木材、芦苇和玉米秆都可以用来作衣料
    在解放以前几乎等于空白点的朝鲜的纺织工业，在战后的年代里兴建了平壤纺织工厂等现代化的纺织联合企业，有了飞跃的发展。今年所有纺织品的产量可达一亿多公尺，达到战前1949年的九倍。即每人可分得十公尺多。
    为了解决人民的穿衣问题，到1961年朝鲜要生产二亿公尺纺织品，使每人平均分得二十公尺。为了完成这个目标，除了在五年计划期间要在新义州和咸兴等地兴建大型纺织厂和丝织厂外，朝鲜采取了一个结合实际的措施，就是发展人造纤维生产。
    朝鲜北部多山，棉花产量较少，战后虽然大力增产，但还远不能满足纺织工业发展的需要。为了解决纤维原料问题，朝鲜的科学家和工人们努力研究人造纤维，最近，他们分别用芦苇浆和玉蜀黍秸浆试制人造纤维成功。一座用这两种原料年产二万吨的人造纤维工厂即将在新义州兴建，加上已经恢复扩建起来的用木材浆作原料的清津人造纤维工厂，到1961年朝鲜每年可生产四万吨人造纤维，能纺织成一亿三千万公尺纺织品。山上的森林、河滩上的芦苇和田里的玉蜀黍秸都将变成朝鲜人民的衣料。
    开展全民性运动广泛生产生活必需品
    现在根据朝鲜劳动党六月全会决议而展开的大中小（工厂、合作社、家庭）结合全民性的生产生活必需品的运动正在蓬蓬勃勃的发展着。朝鲜各轻工业工厂首先参加了这个以扩大品种提高质量为重点的运动。各纺织厂在今年内要把品种由七百五十种扩大到一千种。龙城肉类罐头工厂将由五十一种肉类和果品罐头扩大到一百五十种。各手工业生产合作社生产的蔬菜、鱼、肉等食品的品种数以百计。
    在日用品工业方面的发展特别迅速，今年以来已经试制成功了自行车、缝纫机、钟表等几千种新产品，各个工业系统的大工厂也都设立了日用品车间，钢铁厂利用废铁生产铁锨、农具、小五金和儿童用的小自行车。铁道工厂还利用零碎木材制造木器家具。
    “劳动新闻”曾在社论中号召打破办工业“神秘化”的思想，要求每一个郡都要办一个以上的工厂，利用当地的资金原料，生产生活必需品，满足当地人民的需要，这一运动正在深入地展开中。
    另外，在第一个五年计划期间，朝鲜要建设大量的食品和日用品工厂，今年内动工的就有咸兴肉类加工厂和龙城果品罐头厂等。到1961年，将能够生产五万吨肉类加工品，二十万吨蔬菜加工品，日用品产量将比1956年增加四倍。而在今年内，朝鲜轻工业的生产水平就将达1949年的四倍。
    城乡建设忙　处处盖新房
    朝鲜人民的干劲和群众的力量最明显地表现在建设上。今天，朝鲜的工、农、军、学、商，人人都参加了建设。今年春天平壤的许多工地上都飘扬着一面面学校的校旗，大中学校的学生们有的包修一座楼房的基础，有的包修一条马路。他们都为平壤建设提供了一个月以上的劳动，合计达三十多万个工。平壤的机关干部们自己修了三千五百户住宅。连红领巾们也自己顶石头修筑了儿童公园。农民们除了帮助城市和厂矿建设外，他们正在进行或准备进行新农村的建设。人人动手参加建设，这就是完成第一个五年计划的住宅建设计划——一千万平方公尺城市住宅和二十万幢农村住宅的保证。
    就是由于这种群众性的建设运动，把平壤的建设迅速地推向前进。战前被轰炸成废墟的平壤，今天已建设成为一座崭新的现代化城市。新建成的青年路住宅区、普通门住宅区、公寓路住宅区，到处都是一片片三层到六层的楼房，连“老平壤”也不能不为之惊叹的。到1960年，平壤人就都能住上现代化的新住宅了。
    像平壤一样，朝鲜北部的各个农村也都在进行着或准备进行根本的变化。我所访问过的农业社，每一个都有一个建设蓝图，他们都已准备在第一个五年计划或第二个五年计划内把现有的草房全部拆掉，重新建设成一个新的社会主义的新农村。有的连村子也重新翻过。蓝图上画着整齐排列着的新式农村住宅、托儿所、儿童公园、学校和澡堂。最主要的是这已不仅是美好的理想了，各农业社都已组织起了建设队开始学习技术，准备建设了。最近在平壤市郊的大圣农业社已经看到这个理想的实现。这个农业社从今年4月到8月中旬，社的建设队已经建设了一百幢房子，到明年全社的农户就都可以辞别住了几千年的草房迁入新建的瓦房中去了。在大圣农业社，我们可以看到，农村新住宅有七种标准设计，可以由农民根据自己的人口多少和爱好来选择，再由建设队给他盖。由于各种建筑材料都是国家供给的，每幢房子只要九到十二万元，劳动好的农民两年的劳动所得就可以付完建设费。这个社新盖的一幢幢的红色的农村住宅，像一排士兵排得整齐的队伍，一扇扇的玻璃窗闪耀着金色的阳光。农业社的社长说，房前空地是菜园，房屋周围每家要种四棵果树，另外还要养蜂，喂兔……。看吧！在勤劳的朝鲜人民的勤劳的双手下，社会主义乐园就要建成了。
