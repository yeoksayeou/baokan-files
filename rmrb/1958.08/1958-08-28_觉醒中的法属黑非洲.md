Awakening French Black Africa

Black Africa refers to the vast area south of the Sahara Desert and north and south of the equator in Africa. Because the main inhabitants of this region are black people, it is called Black Africa.

French Black Africa refers to Black Africa under French rule, including French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa, and territories such as Cameroon and Togo under French trusteeship.

French West Africa is divided into the following eight territories: Senegal, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, French Sudan, Niger, Mauritania, and Upper Volta.

French Equatorial Africa is divided into four territories: Gabon, Middle Congo, Ubangi-Shari, and Chad.

According to a report in the Paris weekly "New France" on April 2 this year, French Black Africa covers an area of 7,666,000 square kilometers, more than ten times the size of France itself. It has a population of 28 million, including 120,000 Europeans.

As early as the 13th century, local ethnic groups living in Senegal and other places had established their own countries. Equatorial Africa also established some kingdoms composed of local tribes.

From the 15th century onwards, merchants from Portugal, Britain, France, and other countries successively invaded West Africa. In the early 19th century, French influence gradually expanded into the interior of West Africa and established colonies in Equatorial Africa.

The French Constitution of 1946 forcibly stipulated that French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa were indivisible parts of the French Federation. In 1956, France formulated the "Fundamental Law" for overseas territories. In 1957, the French National Assembly passed a law granting "local autonomy" to French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, establishing so-called "semi-autonomous republics." However, all real administrative power remained in the hands of French High Commissioners.

French Black Africa is very rich in mineral resources, mainly including diamonds, gold, copper, bauxite, phosphorus, tin, iron, manganese, petroleum, and uranium. Agricultural products include grains, tropical vegetables, fruits, livestock, and fish. The colonial authorities forced local residents to cultivate large quantities of peanuts, cocoa, coffee, bananas, and cotton, allowing monopoly capital to extract huge profits. In addition, the colonial authorities forcibly harvested forests.

Under the brutal oppression and exploitation of the colonialists, the people of Black Africa suffered profound disasters.

After the Second World War, the people of French Black Africa launched a struggle for independence and freedom. In 1946, various political groups in French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa formed the "African Democratic Rally" national united front organization. The main purpose of this alliance was to oppose imperialist oppression and fight for political and economic rights. The alliance had only 50,000 members in the year of its establishment, but by 1950 it had exceeded 1.5 million. Despite the wavering behavior of some leaders of the alliance under French persecution, the alliance's congress in 1957 still insisted on the demand for independence.

In the struggle for national independence, the more than 500,000 workers in French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa played an increasingly significant role. In these regions, trade unions and democratic peasant associations were generally established. Youth and student organizations, such as the Black African Student Union, were also organized. The establishment of the "Black African General Confederation of Labor" in 1957 was of great significance. In November 1952, workers in Equatorial Africa and French West Africa launched a general strike, which later developed into mass demonstrations against the tyrannical behavior of French colonialists, racial discrimination, and forced labor. The French colonial authorities were forced to announce the implementation of the Overseas Labor Code abolishing forced labor in January 1956.

Recently, De Gaulle's "constitutional" scam has been fiercely opposed in French Black Africa. Obviously, De Gaulle's trip to Africa will not only not help save France's colonial rule in Africa, but will only intensify the national independence struggle of the Black African people.

　　觉醒中的法属黑非洲
    黑非洲是指非洲撒哈拉大沙漠以南，赤道南北的广大地区。由于这个地区主要的居民都是黑人，所以叫做黑非洲。
    法属黑非洲是指在法国统治下的黑非洲，包括法属西非洲和法属赤道非洲以及由法国托管的喀麦隆和多哥等地区。
    法属西非洲分为以下八个领地：塞内加尔，法属几内亚，象牙海岸，达荷美，法属苏丹，尼日尔，毛里塔尼亚，上伏尔达。
    法属赤道非洲被分为：加蓬，中央刚果，乌班吉沙立，乍得四个领地。
    据巴黎“新法兰西”周刊今年4月2日的报道，法属黑非洲面积七百六十六万六千平方公里，比法国本土大十几倍。人口二千八百万，其中有十二万为欧洲人。
    早在十三世纪，居住在塞内加尔等地的当地民族，就曾建立起他们自己的国家。赤道非洲也建立过当地部族组成的一些王国。
    从十五世纪起，葡、英、法等国商人相继侵入西非洲。十九世纪初，法国势力逐渐向西非洲内地扩展，并在赤道非洲开辟殖民地。
    1946年的法国宪法强行规定法属西非洲、法属赤道非洲为法兰西联邦不可分割的一部分。1956年，法国制定了海外属地的“根本法”。1957年法国国民议会通过给予法属西非洲、法属赤道非洲“地方自治”权的法律，建立所谓“半自治共和国”。但是一切行政实权仍操在法国高级专员手中。
    法属黑非洲的矿藏非常丰富，主要有钻石、黄金、铜、铁矾土、磷、锡、铁、锰、石油、铀等。农产品有谷类、热带蔬菜、水果、家畜、鱼类。殖民当局迫使当地居民大量种植花生、可可、咖啡、香蕉、棉花，使垄断资本榨取巨额利润。此外殖民当局还强行采伐森林。
    在殖民者的残暴压迫和剥削下，黑非洲人民遭到深重的灾难。
    第二次世界大战后，法属黑非洲人民掀起了争取独立自由的斗争。1946年，法属赤道非洲与法属西非洲各政治团体组成了“非洲民主同盟”的民族阵线组织。这个联盟的宗旨主要是反对帝国主义的压迫、争取政治权利和经济权利。盟员在成立的当年仅五万人，到1950年已超过了一百五十万人。尽管联盟的部分领导人物在法国迫害下有动摇表现，但1957年联盟的代表大会仍坚持独立要求。
    在争取民族独立的斗争中，法属赤道非洲和法属西非洲的五十多万工人发挥着日益显著的作用。在这些地区，工会和民主的农民联合会普遍成立。青年学生组织，如黑非洲学生联合会，也组织起来了。1957年“黑非洲总工会”的成立，具有重大意义。1952年11月，赤道非洲和法属西非洲的工人发动了总罢工，后来发展为反对法国殖民者的横暴行为，种族歧视和强迫劳动的群众性示威游行。法国殖民当局不得不于1956年1月宣布实施废除强迫劳动的海外地区劳动法典。
    最近，戴高乐的“宪法”骗局，在法属黑非洲受到了激烈的反对。显然，戴高乐非洲之行，不但不能有助于挽救法国在非洲的殖民统治，而只会使黑非洲人民的民族独立斗争更加高涨。　　（范茂）（附图片）
