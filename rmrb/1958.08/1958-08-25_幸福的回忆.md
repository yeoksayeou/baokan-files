Happy Memories
Colonel Chen Changfeng

　　It's been more than twelve years since I last saw Chairman Mao. I remember on May 17, 1946, I was about to leave the Yan'an Public Security Bureau to work on the Shandong front. Early in the morning, I hurriedly had breakfast and went to bid farewell to Chairman Mao. The Chairman had just gotten up, and when he heard that I was going to the front, he talked to me without even having time to eat. He said, "Are you going to Shandong?" He also said, "Shandong is a very good place, the base area is very large, and many county towns have been newly liberated, and there is a great need for cadres." Then he repeatedly instructed, "You must respect the local area, respect the heads of the new units, and work well with the local cadres." I took out the notebook I had prepared in advance and said, "I'm leaving, please write something for me, Chairman." The Chairman took the notebook and wrote on it: "Chen Changfeng, be loyal to the Party, and faithfully serve the working people." The Chairman then found a photo from his side and said, "I have a photo here, I'll give it to you!" and signed the photo. To this day, I have always kept this photo and his inscription with me.

　　Following Chairman Mao on the Long March

　　Whenever I see the Chairman's photo and inscription, I think of the Chairman's education for me, I think of being Chairman's orderly, being a guard, and following Chairman on the Long March. At that time, I was only sixteen years old, and it would be more accurate to say that the Chairman took care of me than I took care of the Chairman. The Chairman told me revolutionary principles, taught me to read, and helped me learn culture. When he knew that I missed home, he wrote letters home for me. During night marches in heavy rain, the Chairman was afraid that I would fall, so he took the kerosene lamp from my hand and held it himself to light the way for us young fellows. Especially unforgettable was when we were crossing the Liupan Mountains, I had malaria for several days in a row, and I was physically weak. When I was about to climb to the top of the mountain, I was shivering with cold and fainted on the mountain. The Chairman thought that I had malaria again, so he took off his leather coat and put it on me, while he wore only a jacket, braving the biting cold wind.

　　Even more concerning than my life was Chairman's concern for me politically. In February 1936, I left the Chairman to study at the Red Army School. The Chairman asked for my opinion, he said, "Now a new guard has been transferred, would you rather stay with me, or would you rather go to study?" I said, "Then I will go to study." The Chairman paused and said, "Studying is good, not for becoming an official, but for doing more things for the people. Of course, there are many difficulties in studying, as long as you have the determination to serve the people, any difficulty can be overcome."

　　Talking Heart-to-Heart with Chairman

　　After graduating from the Red Army School, I was assigned to work in the Yan'an Public Security Bureau. Sometimes I was still like a child, and I would seize any opportunity to talk to the Chairman about my feelings. At that time, I had some ideas about status, and I felt that I had been an instructor for more than four years, and I should be promoted. Once, I said to the Chairman, "Chairman! How long will I have to be an instructor?" The Chairman said to me, "Being an instructor is also revolutionary work! Is it necessary to become an official?" Then he continued, "Those who want to be officials come to the Communist Party and go to the wrong place! What officials are we talking about here! We are all the same. We are here to serve the people. Coming here, needless to say, if you want to get rich; if you want to be promoted, you will not achieve your goal." After leaving Yan'an and going to Shandong, I went from the army to the local area, and then from the local area to the army, transferred several times. I followed the Chairman's teachings and happily obeyed the assignments.

　　For twelve years since we parted, how much I wanted to see the Chairman! In the years of war, the liberated areas were divided by the enemy, and transportation was inconvenient, so I had to write letters to greet the Chairman. After the national victory, I often wanted to go to Beijing to visit the Chairman, but I was too busy with work to get away. In February 1953, I was studying at a military training class in Nanjing. One day, we received a notice that we were going to gather to see off a leader. Who knew that the person we were seeing off was the Chairman. When we arrived at Xiaguan, we saw the Chairman walking in front of our line, and when he arrived on the ship and waved to the crowd seeing him off, I couldn't wait to run out of the line and say a few words to the Chairman, but how could I leave the team! I could only stare blankly as the Chairman's boat slowly left the dock. After the implementation of the officer vacation system, I always wanted to save some money and use the vacation to go to Beijing to visit the Chairman in order to realize my long-cherished wish.

　　"Chen Changfeng, how are you?"

　　On the afternoon of August 9th this year, the Chairman unexpectedly came to meet with all the representatives attending the Jinan Military Region Party Congress. As soon as the Chairman got out of the car, I was extremely happy. I thought to myself, this time I have to talk to the Chairman. When the Chairman took a group photo with our representatives, I couldn't sit still, thinking about what to say when I saw the Chairman... I was anxious, when Chairman learned that I was also present, so after the group photo, he asked Vice Minister Tong of the Cadre Department and Deputy Director Zhang of the Political Department to call me to see him. I hurriedly ran over and saluted the Chairman in a panic, and was so excited that I couldn't say a word. The many things I had thought of saying at first were all forgotten at this moment. The Chairman said first, "Chen Changfeng?"

　　I said, "Yes!"

　　The Chairman stretched out his hand, and I quickly held it tightly with both hands. Now, I still regret that I didn't ask the Chairman how he was first. The Chairman said, "It's been more than ten years since we parted! How are you?"

　　"It's been twelve years! How is the Chairman?"

　　"Where are you working?"

　　"Working in the ×× Military Sub-district." Director Li of the Political Department and Vice Minister Tong pointed at me and said to the Chairman, "He is the Deputy Commander of the ×× Military Sub-district."

　　The Chairman smiled and said, "You have become a commander!" He then asked with concern, "Have you been home?"

　　I replied, "I went back in 1953."

　　The Chairman said, "Is it back to your hometown of Ningdu?" After so many years of separation, the Chairman still remembered that my home was in Ningdu. I responded, "It's Ningdu."

　　The Chairman then asked, "How is your family, are there any other people?" I reported the population of my family, and the situation of participating in agricultural cooperatives and improving living conditions to the Chairman one by one.

　　The Chairman then asked, "How many children do you have?"

　　I replied, "Four."

　　The Chairman seemed very relieved and said, "That's very good!" He then asked, "How old are you this year?"

　　I said, "More than forty!"

　　The Chairman asked, "Forty something!"

　　I said, "Forty-four!"

　　The Chairman couldn't help but laugh loudly: "That's not young anymore!" The Chairman reached out his hands and firmly shook my hand and said, "Good! Goodbye!" The Chairman's hand was very strong, and his body was much stronger than before. He was wearing a pair of gray pants, a white cloth shirt, and a pair of faded leather shoes, still so simple and approachable. I greedily looked at his tall body, steady pace, until the car drove out of the compound.

　　That night, I lay in bed and couldn't close my eyes all night, I was so happy. Some scenes flashed through my mind, as if I had returned to the Chairman's side. (Attached image)

　　幸福的回忆
　　上校　陈昌奉
    我和毛主席没见面已经是十二年多了。记得1946年5月17日那天，我要离开延安市公安局到山东前线去工作。清晨，我连忙吃过早饭，去向毛主席辞行。主席刚起床，听说我要到前方去，连饭都没来得及吃，就和我谈起来了。他说：“你要到山东去吗？”又说：“山东地方很好，根据地很大，新解放了许多县城，很需要干部。”接着就再三嘱咐说：“到那里要尊重地方，尊重新单位的负责人，要和当地干部搞好团结。”我把事先准备好的笔记本掏出来，说：“我走了，请主席给题个字吧。”主席接过了笔记本在上面写道：“陈昌奉，忠实于党，忠实为劳动人民服务。”主席又从身边找出一张照片说：“我这里有张照片，送给你！”并在照片上签了字。至今，我一直把这张照片和他题的字揣在身边。
    跟随毛主席长征
    每当我看到主席的照片和题字时，我就想起主席对我的教育，我想起给主席当勤务员、当警卫员、跟随主席长征的情景。那时，我才十六岁，与其说是我照顾主席，还不如说是主席照顾我。主席告诉我革命道理，教我识字，帮我学文化。当他知道我惦念家时，就代我写家信。夜行军下大雨，主席怕我摔跤，就从我手里取过马灯，自己提着给我们小鬼照路。尤其难忘的是在过六盘山时，我一连发了几天疟疾，身体虚弱，当快爬到山顶时，我冻得浑身发抖，竟昏倒在山上。主席以为我又犯了疟疾，便把他的皮衣脱下来给我穿上，自己却穿着一身夹衣，顶着刺骨的冷风。
    比生活上更为关心的就是主席对我政治上的关心。1936年2月，我离开主席到红军学校学习，主席征求我的意见，他说：“现在已经调来了新警卫员，你是愿意跟我在一起，还是愿意去学习？”我说：“那我就去学习。”主席停了停说：“学习也好，倒不是为当官，而是为人民多作些事。当然，学习中间也有很多困难，只要你有为人民服务的决心，什么困难都能克服。”
    在主席面前谈心里话
    从红军学校毕业后，我被分配在延安市公安局工作，有时仍像个孩子，一遇机会就到主席跟前谈谈心里话。那时，我有些地位观念，觉得自己干了四年多的指导员，该提拔提拔了。一次，我当着主席的面说：“主席！我这个指导员还要当多久啊？”主席对我说：“指导员也是革命工作嘛！非当上什么官才行吗？”他又接着说：“想当官的人到共产党这里来就是走错门啦！我们这里还有什么官不官啊！都是一样。我们是为人民服务的，到我们这里，想发财当然不用说了；想升官也达不到目的。”离开延安，到山东后，我从部队到地方，又从地方到部队，反复数次调动，我都遵循着主席对我的教导，愉快地服从分配。
    分别十二年来，我是多么想见到主席呀！在战争的年代里，解放区被敌人分割，交通不便，我只好写信问候主席。全国胜利后，我常想去北京探望主席，但工作忙脱不开身。1953年2月间，我在南京某军事训练班学习。有一天，我们接到通知，说是要集合去欢送一位首长，谁知欢送的是主席。到了下关，看到主席从我们队列前走过，到了舰上向欢送的人群招手时，我恨不得跑出队列和主席说几句话，但是怎么能离开队伍呢！我只有呆呆地望着主席的船缓缓离开码头。实行军官休假制度以后，我总想积攒点钱，利用假期去北京一趟，探望主席，以实现我的宿愿。
    “陈昌奉吗，你好？”
    今年8月9日的下午，主席出人意外地来和我们出席济南部队党代表大会的全体代表见面。主席一下车子，我高兴极了。心想，这次可得和主席谈谈。主席和我们代表合影时，我就坐不住了，心里盘算着：见了主席说些啥……。正在焦急中，不知主席从哪里得知我也在场，便在合影后，让干部部的童副部长和政治部的张副主任喊我去见他。我就急忙跑过去慌里慌张向主席敬了个礼，激动得没说出一句话来。原先想起的许多话，这时都忘光了。还是主席先说：“陈昌奉吗？”
    我说：“是呀！”
    主席伸出手来，我连忙用双手紧紧握着它。现在，我还后悔当时怎么没有先问主席好。主席说：“离开十几年啦！你好？”
    “有十二年啦！主席好？”
    “你在那里工作？”
    “在××军分区工作。”政治部李主任和童副部长指着我向主席说，“他是××军分区的副司令员。”
    主席笑着说：“当上司令员啦！”又关切地问：“你回过家吗？”
    我回答：“1953年回去过。”
    主席说：“是回宁都老家吗？”分开这么多年了，主席还记得我的家是宁都。我应声说：“是宁都。”
    主席又问：“家里怎么样，还有什么人？”我把家里的人口，和参加农业合作社、生活改善的情况一一向主席作了汇报。
    主席又问：“你有几个小孩？”
    我答：“有四个。”
    主席好像很宽慰地说：“那很好嘛！”又接着问：“你今年多大啦？”
    我说：“四十多啦！”
    主席问：“四十几啦！”
    我说：“四十四啦！”
    主席不禁哈哈大笑：“可不小啦！”主席伸过双手用力地紧握着我的手对我说：“好！再见！”主席的手劲很大，他的身体也比过去强壮多了。他穿着一条灰裤子，白布衫，一双褪了色的皮鞋，依然是那么朴素、平易近人。我贪婪地望着他那高大的身躯，稳重的步伐，直等车子驶出了大院。
    这天夜里，我躺在床上，一夜都不能合眼，我太幸福了。我的脑海中闪过一些景象，好像又回到了主席的身边。（附图片）
