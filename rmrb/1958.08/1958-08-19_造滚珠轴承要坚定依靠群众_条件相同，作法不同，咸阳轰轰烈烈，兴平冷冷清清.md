　　To Manufacture Ball Bearings, Firmly Rely on the Masses
　　Conditions the Same, Methods Differ—Xianyang Booming, Xingping Cold and Quiet

　　(Our dispatch) According to our reporter Liu Bin: In promoting ball bearings, Xianyang County and Xingping County in Shaanxi Province have achieved different results due to different ideologies and working methods: the former is booming and progressing rapidly; the latter is cold and quiet, and acting slowly.

　　The conditions in Xianyang and Xingping counties are roughly the same. The two counties are neighboring counties, both are agricultural areas located on plains. Both counties have agricultural tool repair shops and local industries, and agricultural cooperatives generally have their own agricultural tool repair facilities. However, in carrying out ball bearing work, the approaches have been completely different: from the evening of July 28th to August 9th, Xianyang County test-manufactured and produced 75 kinds of ball bearing tools of various specifications, 200,000 ball bearings, and more than 2,000 sets of bearings. A total of more than 12,800 pieces of agricultural equipment were equipped with ball bearings, enabling 95% of the county's nine types of rotating tools to be equipped with ball bearings.

　　However, from the evening of July 28th to August 11th, Xingping County only produced more than 20,000 balls and more than 1,500 bearings, and most of them have not yet been installed.

　　After the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed all localities at a telephone conference on the evening of July 28th to install ball bearings on all rotatable tools that could be installed, the Xianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party treated the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee with a serious attitude and put forward the slogan of "Big waves in three days, seeing how things stand in four days." Various meetings were held to urgently arrange tasks and quickly make them known to every household in the county.

　　The leaders in Xingping County only conveyed the instructions at the township Party committee secretary meeting that was being held at the time, and did not mobilize everyone to discuss them. Until August 8th, the Party secretaries of the townships generally had not taken the lead.

　　Xianyang County mobilized all men, women, old and young in the county, and all craftsmen to participate in the movement to manufacture ball bearings. They used their yards, roadsides, and under trees as manufacturing sites. Under the slogan of "Everyone learns technology, every cooperative sets up a factory, every factory makes models, and everyone finds their own tools," they fully relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses, turning the manufacture of ball bearings into a mass movement. Without machines and tools, they manufactured more than 1,700 kinds of machines and tools themselves; without materials, the masses throughout the county provided 300,000 catties of steel. In the practical work of learning while doing, and manufacturing and installing simultaneously, more than 20,000 people in the county have learned the technology in this regard. Because the vast majority of ball bearings are manufactured using indigenous methods, the cost per set is much cheaper than purchasing them on the market.

　　However, the leaders in Xingping County had the idea of relying on other places and did not rely on and mobilize the masses. The county planned to buy about 50% of the bearings needed from other places. More than 70 people were sent to major cities across the country to purchase them a long time ago. However, because the work is being carried out all over the country, it is still unknown whether they have been purchased to this day. In the manufacture of ball bearings, they only concentrated some skilled craftsmen from agricultural cooperatives and did not mobilize the vast number of agricultural cooperative members to form a mass movement. According to the statistics of the Xingping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: as of August 10th, of the 22 townships in the county, only 8 townships had taken action. Among them, the best-performing Xiwu Township has a total of more than 12,000 people, but only more than 100 people are manufacturing ball bearings. More than 10 townships are half-hearted, and 4 townships have not moved at all. Only a small number of workers in agricultural tool repair shops have learned how to manufacture and install them, and ordinary farmers have not learned the technology of manufacturing and installation. Because some of the ball bearings were purchased from other places, the cost is high. It is estimated that installing ball bearings on just one cart will cost about 14 or 15 to 20 yuan, which is more expensive than buying a cart.

　　Agricultural tools retrofitted with ball bearings in Xianyang County can improve labor efficiency by an average of two to three times. Retrofitted carts can save half the animal power, and retrofitted waterwheels, double-wheeled double-bottom plows, and stone mills can reduce the pulling force by one-half to two-thirds. In the past, it took eight or nine people to pull a large cart of manure in Dizhang and Shunling townships, and a small ox could not pull a stone mill, but after installing ball bearings, one person could push it away. According to preliminary estimates, the county can save 240,000 laborers and 60,000 animal powers annually after realizing ball bearing applications, which will alleviate the county's tight labor and animal power situation. However, Xingping County's labor and animal power are still very tight. Now, the Xingping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken effective measures to catch up quickly.

### 造滚珠轴承要坚定依靠群众　条件相同，作法不同，咸阳轰轰烈烈，兴平冷冷清清

　　造滚珠轴承要坚定依靠群众
　　条件相同，作法不同，咸阳轰轰烈烈，兴平冷冷清清
    本报讯　记者刘斌报道：推广滚珠轴承中，陕西省咸阳县和兴平县在不同思想和工作方法指导下得到了不同结果：前一个县轰轰烈烈，进展飞速；后一县是冷冷清清，行动迟缓。
    咸阳和兴平县的条件大体相同。两县是邻县，都是平原农业区。两县都有农具修配厂，有地方工业，农业社一般也都各有自己的农具修配机构。可是，在进行滚珠轴承工作上却是两样：咸阳县从7月28日晚到8月9日，试制并制造各种不同规格的滚珠轴承工具七十五种，滚珠二十万颗，轴承二千多套，装上滚珠轴承的各种农具共达一万二千八百多件，使全县九种运转工具95％都安上滚珠轴承。
    但是，兴平县从上月28日晚到本月11日，只制造出二万多个珠子，一千五百多个轴承，而且一般都还没有安装。
    中共陕西省委在上月28日晚召开的电话会议上指示各地将所有能安装的运转工具都安上滚珠轴承以后，中共咸阳县委以认真严肃态度对待中央和省委指示，提出“三天见大浪，四天看高低”的口号。召开各种会议紧急布置任务，迅速作到全县人民家喻户晓。
    兴平县领导上只在当时正在召开的乡党委书记会议上传达了一下，也没有发动大家进行讨论。直到8日前，各乡的党委书记一般都没有挂帅。
    咸阳县发动了全县的男女老幼，一切工匠参加了制造滚珠轴承的运动。他们把宅旁、路边、树下当作制造的场地。在“人人学技术，社社设工厂，厂厂造模型，自己找工具”的口号下，充分依靠群众的智慧和力量，把制造滚珠轴承变成了群众性的运动。没有机器和工具，自己就制造了一千七百多种机具；没有材料，全县群众就拿出三十万斤钢铁；在边干边学，边造边装的实际工作中，全县已经有两万多人学会了这方面的技术。因为绝大部分滚珠轴承是采用土法制造的，所以每套成本也比市场购买的便宜好多。
    但是，兴平县领导上存在依靠外地的思想，没有依靠和发动群众。全县共计划在外地来买的轴承占全县需要轴承的50％左右。在很早前已经派出七十多个人到全国各大城市采购。但因为全国各地都在进行这个工作，直到现在还不知买到没有。他们在制造滚珠轴承中，只集中了一些农业社的巧工能匠，没有发动广大农业社员形成群众性的运动。据中共兴平县委会统计：截止8月10日，全县共二十二个乡，已经行动起来的只有八个乡，其中动得最好的西吴乡共有一万二千多人，制造滚珠轴承的只有一百多人。还有十来个乡似动非动，四个乡根本没动。学会制造和安装的只有一少部分农具修配厂的工人，一般农民都没有学会制造和安装的技术。因为一部分滚珠轴承是从外地买来的，成本较大。估计仅给一辆架子车安上滚珠轴承，即需要十四、五元到二十元左右，比买一辆架子车还贵。
    咸阳县用滚珠轴承改装的农具，平均可提高劳动效率两倍到三倍以上。改装的大车，可节省一半畜力，改装后的水车、双轮双铧犁、石磨可减轻拉力二分之一到三分之二。底张、顺陵两乡原来由八、九个人才能拉动一大车粪，原来一个小牛拉不动的石磨子，安上滚珠轴承后，各有一个人就可以推着走。据初步估计，全县在实现滚珠轴承后全年就可节约劳力二十四万个、畜力六万个，使全县的劳、畜力紧张情况得到缓和。但是，兴平县的劳、畜力仍然很紧。现在，中共兴平县委已经采取了有效措施，急起直追。
