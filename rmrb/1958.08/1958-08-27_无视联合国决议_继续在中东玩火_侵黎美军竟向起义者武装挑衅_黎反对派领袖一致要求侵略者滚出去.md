　　Ignoring UN Resolutions, Continuing to Play with Fire in the Middle East
    US Aggressor Troops in Lebanon Provoke Armed Clashes with Insurgents
    Lebanese Opposition Leaders Unanimously Demand Aggressors Get Out
    Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, Beirut dispatch: American aggressor troops' tank units yesterday suddenly surrounded the Basta district of the Lebanese capital, controlled by insurgents, and its artillery units occupied positions opposite the insurgent army.
    According to reports, U.S. aggressor troops' Marines and tank units are building fortifications along the coastal road surrounding the Basta district. One U.S. tank even crushed the insurgents' wooden barriers.
    Lebanese insurgents are digging trenches and building new obstacles and barricades to strengthen their positions in preparation for serious military provocations that the American aggressor troops may launch.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Beirut dispatch: Insurgents in the Lebanese capital are determined to punish American aggressor troops who intrude into the areas they control.
    On the evening of the 22nd, an American aggressor troop named Larry Williams intruded near the headquarters of Lebanese insurgents. The insurgents opened fire on the American soldier who refused to leave. The American soldier was shot in the shoulder before running away.
    On the 23rd, the headquarters of the US aggressor troops in Lebanon denied that the American soldier had intruded into the insurgents' area, but on the 24th, it had to publicly admit that the soldier had "slightly exceeded" his prescribed area of activity.
    On the same day, two other U.S. aggressor troops' Marine soldiers "took the wrong road" near Beirut International Airport and intruded into the insurgents' area. The Lebanese insurgents arrested them and released them after several hours of interrogation. The insurgents confiscated one of the soldiers' pistols.
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 26th (via cable): According to newspapers here today, thirty-two Lebanese opposition leaders held a meeting in Beirut on the evening of the 25th and passed a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of American aggressor troops, and calling on the insurgent forces to hold their positions in order to achieve the purpose of the uprising.
    The report said that the decision passed at the six-hour meeting held at the home of former Prime Minister Salam stated that the leaders of the national uprising forces and the opposition leaders were united, and that they would maintain this unity in the people's struggle under any circumstances to achieve the goals of the uprising, and refute all rumors spread by corrupt elements to divide the opposition.
    The opposition leaders decided to notify the newly elected President Shehab that all political parties, groups, and individuals belonging to the opposition support Shehab, and demand that he immediately withdraw U.S. troops from Lebanon, resolutely crush all conspiracies, so as to eliminate all traitors, corrupt elements, and terrorists, because these elements form a fifth column that serves foreign interests and creates division within the people.
    The decision also stated that the opposition leaders demand that Shehab unconditionally implement the resolution passed by the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon. They also demanded that no international arrangements be used to guarantee the withdrawal of troops, because such arrangements and the like could be regarded as open interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, which would affect Lebanon's independence and sovereignty. The opposition leaders also demanded that Shehab end the duties of the United Nations observers.
    The opposition leaders called on the people's uprising forces to hold their positions and continue their struggle, because Chamoun still insists on his attitude. They pointed out that the Chamoun regime must bear full responsibility for future events. The opposition also stated that they refused to cooperate with anyone who colludes with Chamoun to create disputes, corrupt the country, or change Lebanon's foreign policy to pave the way for foreign occupation.
    The opposition leaders' decision also demanded to ensure that the opposition's demand is met: in the new stage, a new government should be formed by the opposition and other reliable people to complete the goals of the Lebanese uprising and normalize the situation.
    The decisions were signed by the leaders of the National Front and the leaders of the insurgent forces, including Hamad, Karami, Yafi, Oueini, Jumblatt, Salam, and others.
    Newspapers reported that the opposition delegation met with Shehab on the evening of the 25th and conveyed these decisions to him. The delegation was composed of Yafi, Karami, Oueini, and Jumblatt.
    At the same time, the "Opinion Newspaper" reported today that yesterday, just as the opposition leaders were holding a meeting at Salam's home in the Basta district, the American occupation forces suddenly surrounded the Basta district controlled by the insurgents. The newspaper also said that the insurgent forces demanded that the US troops withdraw, but they refused to withdraw, and then shooting occurred.

　　无视联合国决议　继续在中东玩火
    侵黎美军竟向起义者武装挑衅
    黎反对派领袖一致要求侵略者滚出去
    新华社26日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国侵略军的坦克部队昨天突然包围了黎巴嫩首都起义者控制的巴斯塔区，它的炮兵部队占据了起义军对面的阵地。
    据报道，美国侵略军的海军陆战队和坦克部队正在沿着围绕巴斯塔区的海滨马路修筑工事。有一辆美军坦克还压毁了起义者的木制障碍物。
    黎巴嫩起义者正在挖掘战壕和修筑新障碍物和街垒，以加强自己的阵地，防备美国侵略军可能发动的严重的军事挑衅活动。
    新华社25日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩首都的起义者坚决惩治闯入他们控制地区的美国侵略军。
    22日傍晚，有一名叫拉里·威廉斯的美国侵略军闯到黎巴嫩起义者的总部附近。起义者向这个拒绝离开的美国大兵开枪射击。这个美军在被击伤肩部后才撒腿逃跑。
    侵黎美军总部，在23日抵赖这个美军曾闯入起义者的地区，但是在24日不得不公开承认，这名士兵是“略为越出”他的规定活动范围。
    同一天另有两名美国侵略军的海军陆战队士兵在贝鲁特国际机场附近“走错了路”，侵入起义者的地区。黎巴嫩起义者把他们逮捕，经过几小时的讯问后方予释放。起义者没收了其中一人的手枪。
    新华社大马士革26日电　据今天这里的报纸报道，黎巴嫩的三十二名反对派领袖25日晚上在贝鲁特举行了一次会议，通过决议要求美国侵略军立即撤退，并且号召起义部队坚守他们的阵地以求达到起义的目的。
    消息说，这次在前总理萨拉姆的家里举行的六小时会议上通过的决定说，全国起义部队领袖和反对派领袖团结一致，不管在什么情况下，在人民斗争中都要坚持这种团结来实现起义的目的，并且驳斥一切腐化分子为了分裂反对派而散布的谣言。
    反对派领袖决定通知新当选为总统的谢哈布，属于反对派的一切政党、团体和个人都支持谢哈布，并且要求他使美军立即撤离黎巴嫩，坚决粉碎一切阴谋，以便清除一切卖国分子、腐化分子和恐怖分子，因为这些分子组成了为外国利益服务并且在人民内部制造分裂的第五纵队。
    决定还说，反对派领袖要求谢哈布无条件地实现联合国大会紧急会议通过的要求外国军队撤离黎巴嫩的决议。他们还要求不要用任何国际安排来保证军队的撤退，因为这类安排以及诸如此类的事情都可以被认为是对黎巴嫩内政的公开干涉，这将会影响黎巴嫩的独立和主权。反对派领袖还要求谢哈布结束联合国观察人员的职责。
    反对派领袖们号召人民起义部队坚守他们的阵地，继续进行战斗，因为夏蒙仍然坚持他的态度。他们指出，夏蒙政权要对将来可能发生的事件负全部责任。反对派还表示，他们拒绝同和夏蒙勾结在一起制造纠纷、使国家腐化、或者改变黎巴嫩的外交政策而为外国占领铺平道路的任何人进行合作。
    反对派领袖的决定还要求保证满足反对派的这种要求：在新的阶段要由反对派以及其他可靠人士成立新政府来完成黎巴嫩起义的目的并且使局势正常化。
    在这些决定上签字的有民族阵线的领袖和起义部队的领袖，其中包括哈马德、卡拉米、雅非、乌埃尼、琼卜拉特、萨拉姆等。
    报纸报道，反对派代表团在25日晚上会晤了谢哈布，并且把这些决定转告他。代表团是由雅非、卡拉米、乌埃尼和琼卜拉特组成的。
    同时，“舆论报”今天报道，昨天正当反对派领袖们在巴斯塔区萨拉姆家中举行会议时，美国占领军突然包围了起义者控制的巴斯塔区。报纸又说，起义部队要求美军撤退，但是他们拒绝撤退，于是发生了射击。
