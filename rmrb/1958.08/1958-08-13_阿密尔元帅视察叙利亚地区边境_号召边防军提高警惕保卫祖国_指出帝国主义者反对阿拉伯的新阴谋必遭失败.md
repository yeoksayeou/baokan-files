Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 12th: According to a report from Damascus Radio on the 11th, Marshal Amer, Vice President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic, pointed out on the 11th that imperialism will create new conspiracies against the Arab people, but they are destined to fail. He called on the border troops in the Syrian region to maintain unity and vigilance to defend the United Arab Republic and every part of the Arab nation, so that they are not subject to evil violations.

Marshal Amer, accompanied by Major General Jamal Faisal, commander of the First Army, and a number of senior officers, inspected the border area of the Syrian region and delivered a speech to the officers and soldiers. He praised the soldiers for their spirit of self-sacrifice at any time and their high morale.

Amer said that we are not afraid of anyone, nor do we want to invade anyone. We just want to defend our ideal goal, which is to strengthen Arab nationalism, which constitutes the basis of our dignity and glory. Arab nationalism confronted those great powers that possessed atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and fleets. These great powers were forced to recognize Arab nationalism.

Amer spoke about the various attempts by imperialist countries in the past to undermine the independence and unity of Arab countries, and said: When all these failed, imperialism launched a naked armed aggression against us, but their armed aggression also failed. Amer then pointed out: Imperialists may once again resort to the old tricks we are familiar with: engaging in conspiracies and sowing discord, but they are destined to fail.

Amer said that the Iraqi revolution, the 1952 Egyptian revolution, and the Syrian people's struggle to maintain freedom and independence are all linked by a common and powerful bond, which is Arab nationalism.

　　阿密尔元帅视察叙利亚地区边境
　　号召边防军提高警惕保卫祖国
　　指出帝国主义者反对阿拉伯的新阴谋必遭失败
    新华社大马士革12日电　据大马士革电台11日报道，阿拉伯联合共和国副总统、武装部队总司令阿密尔元帅11日指出，帝国主义将会制造反对阿拉伯人民的新阴谋，但是它们肯定是要失败的。他号召叙利亚地区边防部队保持团结和警惕，以保卫阿拉伯联合共和国和阿拉伯民族的每一部分，使不受邪恶的侵犯。
    阿密尔元帅在第一军军长贾马勒·费萨尔将军和一些高级军官的陪同下视察了叙利亚地区边境，并且向部队官兵发表了演说。他对士兵们随时准备自我牺牲的精神和高昂的士气表示赞扬。
    阿密尔说，我们不畏惧任何人，也不想侵犯任何人。我们只是要保卫我们理想的目标，这就是加强构成我们的尊严和光荣的基础的阿拉伯民族主义。阿拉伯民族主义对抗了那些握有原子弹、氢弹和舰队的大国。这些大国被迫承认了阿拉伯民族主义。
    阿密尔谈到了过去帝国主义国家破坏阿拉伯国家独立和团结的各种企图，并说：当所有这些失败了之后，帝国主义就对我们进行了赤裸裸的武装侵略，但他们的武装侵略也失败了。阿密尔接着指出：帝国主义者也许会再一次乞灵于我们熟悉的老一套手法：搞阴谋和挑拨离间，但是它们肯定是要失败的。
    阿密尔说，伊拉克的革命和1952年埃及的革命以及叙利亚人民维护自由和独立的争斗都有一条共同的强有力的纽带联系着，这条纽带就是阿拉伯民族主义。
