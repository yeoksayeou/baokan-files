Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 18th: French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos published an article in "l'Humanité" this morning, exposing that French Prime Minister De Gaulle's policy, which he boasted would bring "a great future for the nation," will lead to France's increasing loss of national independence.

Duclos wrote: Anti-communist discrimination and loss of national independence are two sides of the same coin. For many years, successive French governments have, on the one hand, prevented communists from participating in the management of state affairs, and on the other hand, pursued a policy of subordinating France to American imperialists. One manifestation of this is handing over the American bases located on French territory entirely to the command of the American headquarters. Recently, these bases have been used to transport personnel and war materials to Lebanon.

Duclos pointed out that since De Gaulle came to power, American bases have continued to exist on French territory, and former Nazi General Speidel continues to serve as the commander of the NATO army in France.

Not only that, De Gaulle also supports the intervention by Britain and the United States in the Middle East. Although he may have disagreements with Britain and the United States in the implementation of plundering policies, he still colludes with Britain and the United States in the implementation of colonial policies.

Duclos wrote, referring to De Gaulle's recent talks with the Italian and West German governments: De Gaulle is attempting to act as a spokesperson for the West German and Italian governments in the event of a summit meeting. However, the position of German imperialists is constantly strengthening, and France has even borrowed money from them. Therefore, German imperialists hope to act as the leader of Little Europe, while the Italian ruling class has its own plans.

As for the negotiations between France and Tunisia and Morocco, they are even more unable to bridge the gap between France and these two countries.

Duclos emphasized that in order to solve the problem of Algeria war expenditures, France has to borrow foreign debts, and the result is dangerously deepening France's dependence on American and West German creditors.

Duclos concluded: War, poverty, debt, obedience to the demands of foreign imperialists, this is the true content of the policy that De Gaulle insists on implementing for the sake of "a great future for the nation." The longer De Gaulle is in power, the further the Algerian war will intensify, and the more France will lose its national independence. De Gaulle has tied France to the reactionary colonialist net, and therefore he has led France onto the road of disaster and national decline.

Duclos called on the French people to express firm opposition to dictatorship for the sake of democracy and national interests, so that the Republic can survive, and France can live in independence, peace, freedom, and social progress.

### 战争、贫困、负债、屈从外国　戴高乐把法国引向灾难　杜克洛号召人民反对独裁维护民族独立

　　战争、贫困、负债、屈从外国
　　戴高乐把法国引向灾难
　　杜克洛号召人民反对独裁维护民族独立
    新华社巴黎18日电  法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛今天早晨在“人道报”上发表文章揭露法国总理戴高乐所吹嘘的所谓将带来“民族伟大前途”的政策将使法国日益丧失民族独立。
    杜克洛写道：反共歧视政策和丧失民族独立是一件事的两个方面。多年以来，历届法国政府一方面阻止共产党人参加管理国家事务，同时奉行使法国从属于美帝国主义者的政策。表现之一就是把设立在法国领土上的美国基地完全交给美国司令部去管辖，在最近期间，这些基地被用来运送人员和战争物资到黎巴嫩去。
    杜克洛指出，自从戴高乐执政以来，法国领土上继续存在着美国基地，前纳粹将领斯派达尔继续在法国担任北大西洋集团军指挥官的职务。
    不仅如此，戴高乐也支持英美在中东进行的干涉，虽然他同英美两国在执行掠夺政策方面可能是有分歧的，但是，在执行殖民政策方面，他还是同英美两国狼狈为奸的。
    杜克洛谈到戴高乐最近同意大利和西德政府进行的会谈时写道：戴高乐企图在万一举行最高级会议时充当西德和意大利政府的代言人。但是，德国帝国主义者的地位不断加强，而法国甚至向他们借了钱，所以，德国帝国主义者希望充当小欧洲的首领，意大利统治阶级则另有自己的打算。
    至于法国同突尼斯和摩洛哥所进行的谈判，那更是无法填补法国和这两个国家之间的鸿沟。
    杜克洛强调指出，为了要解决阿尔及利亚战争开支的问题，法国就不得不借外债，其结果是危险地加深了法国对美国和西德债主的从属地位。
    杜克洛最后写道：战争、贫困、负债、听命于外国帝国主义者的要求，这就是戴高乐硬说是为了“民族伟大前途”而执行的政策的真正内容。而戴高乐执政愈久，阿尔及利亚战争就将进一步加剧，法国也就将愈加丧失民族独立。戴高乐把法国缚在倒行逆施的殖民主义的罗网之中，因此他就把法国引上了灾难和国家衰落的道路。
    杜克洛号召法国人民为了民主和民族的利益表示坚决反对独裁，以使共和国得以生存，使法国得以在独立、和平、自由和社会进步中生活下去。
