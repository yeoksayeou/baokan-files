Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th -- The "Delhi Times Weekly" reported on the 5th, citing Middle Eastern sources, that American soldiers are secretly gathering in Iran. Eight hundred and fifty American soldiers in civilian clothes have already arrived in Iran and will be used to implement plans against the Iraqi government. This matter is still in progress.

The weekly also pointed out in another report that because Britain has officially recognized the Republic of Iraq and the new Iraqi government has not faced opposition, it is currently difficult for Britain to directly interfere in Iraq. The weekly said that, under these circumstances, the British Military Intelligence and the British Intelligence Service have been instructed to create incidents in the Basra and Mosul areas of Iraq, where British oil companies are located, and on the Iraqi border, in order to conspire to sabotage the government of the Republic of Iraq.

    美英特务大活动  策划破坏伊拉克
    据新华社新德里5日电  “德里时代周报”在5日报道，据中东消息，美国军人正在伊朗秘密集中。目前已经有八百五十名美国军人穿着便服到达伊朗，他们将被用来实现反对伊拉克政府的计划。这件事还在进行中。
    这家周刊在另一则消息中指出，由于英国正式承认伊拉克共和国和伊拉克新政府没有受到反对，英国目前难以对伊拉克进行直接干涉。周刊说，在这种情况下，英国军事情报处和英国情报处已经得到指示，要在伊拉克的巴士拉和摩苏尔地区英国的石油公司所在地以及在伊拉克边境制造事件，以便阴谋破坏伊拉克共和国政府。
