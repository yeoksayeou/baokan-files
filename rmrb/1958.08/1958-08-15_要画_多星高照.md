To Paint "Many Stars Shining Brightly"

　　“三星高照” (Sān xīng gāo zhào - Three Stars Shining Brightly) is a very popular auspicious saying in Chinese folklore. In the old society, the "three stars" referred to the Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity. The so-called "Three Stars Shining Brightly" meant that people hoped to have a life of longevity, wealth, and honor.

　　Today, we are publishing a painting celebrating the bumper harvest, titled "Three Stars Shining Brightly." The "three stars" referred to in this painting are wheat, rice, and corn. Here, "Three Stars Shining Brightly" means that the great harvest of wheat, rice, and corn will bring a happy life to the people. Therefore, "Three Stars Shining Brightly" has a completely new meaning here. However, judging from the current state of agricultural production this year, various crops are yielding high-yield "satellites." Therefore, we hope that artists will quickly paint "Many Stars Shining Brightly" to celebrate the bumper harvest.

　　要画“多星高照”
    “三星高照”是中国民间流传很广的一句吉利话。在旧社会，“三星”是指福星、禄星和寿星，所谓“三星高照”，就是说人们希望得到延年益寿和富贵荣华的生活。
    今天，我们发表了一张庆丰收的画，题目是“三星高照”。这张画上所指的“三星”是小麦、水稻和玉米，这里所说的“三星高照”是小麦、水稻和玉米的大丰收，将给人民带来幸福生活。因此，在这里“三星高照”有了全新的意义。但是，从今年农业生产的情况来看，各种农作物都有高产“卫星”。因此，希望画家们赶紧画“多星高照”来庆丰收。
