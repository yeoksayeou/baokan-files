　　Xinhua News Agency Report: United Arab Republic media, in commenting on the results of the UN General Assembly emergency session, pointed out that the withdrawal of American and British aggressor troops from the Middle East in accordance with UN resolutions is crucial to easing tensions in the Middle East.

　　A commentator on Cairo Radio on the evening of the 23rd said that the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the Arab countries' proposal does not mean that the Middle East crisis is over, unless the aggressor troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. Otherwise, the crisis will not be eliminated.

　　The commentator urged the people of the Middle East and the people of the world to remain vigilant. He said that as long as the British and American troops occupy Lebanon and Jordan for one day, the danger of war continues to exist. He also said that due to the pressure of world public opinion, the imperialists were forced to agree to the Arab proposal. Unless it is in their own interests, they will not respect UN resolutions and will do everything possible to delay the withdrawal. The commentator said that during the tripartite Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, it was only under the strong and unified pressure of the Arab people that the invading forces withdrew from Port Said. "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial on the 23rd pointing out that whether the UN resolution on the Middle East issue can be smoothly implemented is directly related to what practical measures UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld takes to urge the withdrawal of British and American troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper said that the most important goal of Hammarskjöld's mission is to make foreign troops withdraw from the Middle East. If this cannot be done, the resolution will be nothing more than a piece of paper. The threat to world peace will remain.

　　"Al Shaab"’s editorial demanded that the imperialists abide by the United Nations resolutions and withdraw British and American troops from the Middle East as soon as possible.

　　It said that unless the UN resolution is implemented accurately and faithfully, true peace will not be consolidated. The newspaper warned the imperialists: The peace desired by the Arab people is inseparable from independence, freedom, neutrality, and non-participation in pacts.

　　"Al Messa" on the 23rd called on the Arab people to make serious efforts to strive for a summit meeting, "because this meeting may achieve practical ways to prevent mankind from suffering dangers now and in the future."

　　The newspaper said that the UN General Assembly emergency session was convened on the suggestion of Khrushchev. The purpose of the meeting was to resolve the Middle East crisis by driving foreign troops out of the Middle East, thereby paving the way for a summit meeting.

　　Damascus's "Al Nour" on the 24th called on the Arab people to continue their resolute struggle to force the American and British aggressor troops to completely withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution.

　　In an editorial entitled "As Long as One Foreign Soldier Remains in Lebanon and Jordan, the Struggle Will Continue!", the newspaper pointed out that the Arabs should continue this struggle with the most resolute and vigilant attitude and on the basis of uniting national forces as widely as possible.

　　The newspaper called on the Arabs to resolutely struggle to prevent the United States and Britain from using certain weaknesses in the resolution unanimously adopted by the United Nations, which stipulates that their troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, to delay and procrastinate the withdrawal. The newspaper pointed out that many experiences in dealing with imperialism remind us to be highly suspicious and vigilant of imperialism.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 24th: The Hungarian newspaper "Népszabadság" published on the 24th a conversation between Arab Republic Vice President Hourani and former Syrian President Kuwatly in Damascus with reporters from "Népszabadság" and Hungarian Radio.

　　In response to how to resolve the Middle East issue, especially the issues caused by the current situation in Lebanon and Jordan, Hourani said that the Middle East issue is so acute because foreign troops have invaded Jordan and Lebanon. The question now is that foreign troops should first withdraw from these two countries. In this way, the Middle East issue will be easily resolved.

　　Kuwatly said in response to this question that the problems of Lebanon and Jordan are the internal affairs of these two countries. The Arab people will never allow anyone to interfere in their internal affairs and will never allow any foreign troops to create chaos on their territory. He said that, according to the principles of the UN Charter, people have the right to freely elect their government and choose one political system or another. No country is allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore, we demand that British and American troops withdraw from Jordan and Lebanon immediately. We want to force these countries to withdraw their troops, because their occupation is not in accordance with the will of the people of the countries concerned.

　　In their conversation, Hourani and Kuwatly also talked about the movement to strive for Arab unity and the development of economic and cultural relations with Hungary.

　　不许美英侵略者拖延撤军
    阿联舆论呼吁中东人民为实现联大决议加紧斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿拉伯联合共和国舆论在评论联大紧急会议结果时指出，美英侵略军队根据联合国决议撤出中东，是缓和中东紧张局势的关键。
    开罗电台评论员23日晚上说，联合国大会通过阿拉伯国家提案并不意味着中东危机已经过去，除非侵略者的军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，否则危机不会消除。
    评论员要求中东人民和世界人民保持警惕，他说，只要英美军队占领黎巴嫩和约旦一天，战争危险就继续存在。他又说，由于世界舆论的压力，帝国主义被迫同意阿拉伯提案。除非符合他们自己的利益，否则他们是不会尊重联合国决议的，而且将会千方百计来拖延撤退，评论员说，在英法以三国侵略埃及期间，只是在阿拉伯人民的强大和一致的压力下，侵略军才从塞得港撤走。“共和国报”23日发表社论指出，联合国关于中东问题的决议是否能够顺利执行，与联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德为了促使英美军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦采取什么实际措施直接有关。报纸说，哈马舍尔德的使命的最重要目标是使外国军队撤出中东。如果不能做到这一点，决议不过是一纸空文。世界和平的威胁将仍旧存在。
    “人民报”的社论要求帝国主义者遵守联合国的决议，早日把英美军队撤出中东。
    它说，除非联合国决议得到精确的和忠实的执行，否则，真正的和平将不会得到巩固。报纸警告帝国主义者：阿拉伯各国人民所希望的和平是同独立、自由、中立和不参加公约不可分的和平。
    “晚报”23日要求阿拉伯人民为争取举行最高级会议作认真的努力，“因为这个会议可能得到实际的办法来防止人类在现在和将来遭受危险”。
    报纸说，联合国大会紧急会议是根据赫鲁晓夫的建议召开的。会议的目的是要通过把外国军队赶出中东的办法解决中东危机，从而为召开最高级会议铺平道路。
    大马士革“光明报”24日号召阿拉伯人民继续坚决进行斗争，以迫使美英侵略军按照联合国大会决议全部撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    这家报纸在题为“只要有一名外国军队还留在黎巴嫩和约旦，斗争就将继续下去！”的社论中指出，阿拉伯人应当以尽量坚决和警惕的态度、尽量广泛地团结民族力量的基础上来继续进行这种斗争。
    报纸号召阿拉伯人坚决斗争，防止美国和英国利用联合国一致通过的规定它们的军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议的某些弱点来耽搁和拖延撤退。报纸指出，同帝国主义打交道的许多经验提醒我们，要对帝国主义严加怀疑和警惕。
    新华社布达佩斯24日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”24日刊登了阿拉伯联合共和国副总统胡拉尼和前叙利亚总统库阿特利在大马士革向“人民自由报”和匈牙利广播电台记者发表的谈话。
    在回答如何才能解决中近东问题，特别是由于黎巴嫩和约旦目前的局势所引起的问题时，胡拉尼说，中东问题之所以表现得很尖锐，是因为外国军队侵入了约旦和黎巴嫩。现在的问题是，外国军队应当首先从这两个国家撤出。这样，中东问题就很容易解决了。
    库阿特利在回答这个问题时说，黎巴嫩和约旦的问题是这两个国家的内政。阿拉伯人民决不允许任何人干涉他们的内政，决不允许任何外国军队在他们的领土上制造混乱。他说，按照联合国宪章的原则，人民有权利自由选举他们的政府和选择这种或那种政治体制，不允许任何国家干涉其他国家的内政。因此，我们要求英美军队立即撤出约旦和黎巴嫩。我们要强迫这些国家撤出它们的军队，因为他们的占领是不符合有关国家人民的意志的。
    胡拉尼和库阿特利在谈话中还谈到了争取阿拉伯统一斗争的运动和发展同匈牙利的经济和文化关系等问题。
