　　We Want Our People Back!
　　Worker of Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill, Wang Shumin
　　One morning in the winter of 1945, the sisters in the class were talking in groups of twos and threes, each looking quite worried.

　　Sun Shilan said, "The union representatives are having a meeting, why are they asking the workers for travel expenses?"

　　Miao Yuzhen was also very angry: "You can say that again, not only are they asking for travel expenses, but I heard that they're going to reduce our wages this month."

　　We were all very anxious. Everyone asked, "If that's the case, what are we going to eat after working hard for a month? All the money will be taken away by them!"

　　At this time, Sun Shirong said, "Several representatives went to the factory director's office today to demand that we be paid according to the price level on the fifth!"

　　We said in unison, "That's great! Who went?"

　　Miao Yuzhen said, "Sun Shiju from the laboratory led the way!"

　　Everyone happily said, "It would be great if they were elected as union directors, they definitely wouldn't ask us for travel expenses, and they wouldn't deduct our wages either."

　　Everyone started discussing animatedly. Since the Japanese devils surrendered, the factory was organized into a puppet union by foremen and gangster thugs. They didn't do anything for the workers, but instead helped the factory oppress the workers. Everyone hated them, and they all hoped to have representatives who would truly work for the workers.

　　Suddenly, someone said, "Why haven't our people come back yet? They mustn't be detained by the factory!"

　　Sun Shirong and Miao Yuzhen heard this and glared, saying, "What nonsense? Detain people? If they dare to detain people, we'll fight them today!"

　　Just as they were talking, Xu Ming and ran in from outside, his face pale, and shouted loudly, "Our people have been detained, quickly shut down the machines, quickly shut down the machines, go out and demand their release!"

　　When we heard this, we were furious. We immediately shut down the machines, and everyone rushed out of the workshop like a tide.

　　Halfway there, the puppet soldiers set up machine guns, and the puppet union directors Wang Mengfu and Feng Peiru were standing in front. The puppet soldiers threatened us loudly, "What are you doing here, why aren't you working properly!"

　　A group of us female workers ran to the front, and everyone shouted in unison, "We want our representatives, we want people, and we also want the cornmeal subsidy."

　　The puppet soldiers shouted harshly, "We'll shoot you, the machine gun will pick you off one by one!"

　　Sun Shirong stepped forward and stood in front of the machine gun, saying, "Shoot, just shoot me!"

　　Qi Shuhua, a female worker from the doubling workshop, also stepped forward to snatch the machine gun. When she couldn't grab it, she pointed at the noses of the puppet soldiers and cursed loudly, "You eat us, drink us, and you still come to beat us, do you have any conscience?"

　　As she spoke, everyone rushed forward. Seeing this, they realized that the machine gun was useless, so Wang Mengfu came out to speak:

　　"Your representatives are discussing things with the factory director, and they will come back tomorrow!"

　　Everyone said, "No, we want our people out now!"

　　We went forward and surrounded the puppet union members Feng Peiru and Wang Mengfu, asking them, "What are you doing wearing long gowns, not doing anything for us workers."

　　Feng Peiru said, "You go back to work first, and the representatives will be released at four o'clock in the afternoon!"

　　"No!" we shouted in unison, "We won't go back until we see our people!"

　　They had no choice but to release the detained representatives. The representatives Sun Shiju and Zhang Jiaxu walked out together, and we rushed forward, holding their hands, truly feeling indescribably happy. Everyone was applauding, walking up to them.

　　Sun Shiju jumped onto a roadside cart and spoke to everyone: "Brothers and sisters, we are working for everyone, but the factory wanted to arrest us. If you all hadn't come out, we would have been sent away. From now on, we must be even more united. Anyway, I'm not afraid to risk my head. Our factory's union doesn't work for us workers, but instead oppresses us. We must unite and overthrow the union that drinks our blood!"

　　We all shouted loudly, "Down with the blood-sucking union, elect our own representatives!"

　　That afternoon, we returned to the workshop and established an organization to overthrow the puppet union. Slogans were posted everywhere in the workshop, and we even composed clappers and posted them in conspicuous places.

　　Two months later, we elected our own workers' union, and elected Sun Shiju and Zhang Jiaxu as union representatives, overthrowing the puppet union.

### 要我们的人去！

　　要我们的人去！
　　天津棉纺五厂工人　王淑敏
    1945年冬天的一个早晨，班上的姐妹们三两成群的在说话，个个显出挺发愁的样子。
    孙士兰说：“工会代表开会，干吗找工人要车马费呢？”
    苗玉珍也很生气：“可说呢，不光要车马费，听说这个月还要少发工资呢。”
    我们都很着急，大家问：“要那样，咱们辛苦一个月还吃什么呢？钱都被他们要去了！”
    这时，孙士荣说：“咱们今天去了几个代表到厂长室去要求了，得按五号的物价发给咱！”
    我们异口同声的说道：“这可好啦！谁去呢？”
    苗玉珍说：“试验室孙世琚领着头去了！”
    大伙都高兴的说：“要是选他们当工会理事多好，他们准不向咱要车马费，也不会扣咱们工资。”
    大家就你一言我一语的议论起来。自从日本鬼子投降后，厂里由把头、流氓打手们组织了个伪工会，不给工人办事，倒帮着厂里压迫工人。大伙都恨透了，都盼望能有真正给工人办事的代表。
    忽然，有人说：“咱们去的人怎么还不回来呢？可别叫厂里给扣起来啊！”
    孙士荣和苗玉珍听了，就瞪圆了眼说：“嘛玩艺？扣人？他们敢扣人，今天就跟他拚啦！”
    正在说着，只见徐明和从外面跑进来，脸色发白，大声喊道：“咱的人扣下了，快关车，快关车，出去要人！”
    我们一听，气极了，立刻关车，大伙儿像潮水似的跑出了车间。
    跑到半道上，伪军架上机关枪了，前边儿站着伪工会的理事王梦孚、冯佩如。伪军大声威胁我们：“你们干吗来了，不好好干活去！”
    我们一伙子女工跑到最前面，大家齐声喊：“要我们的代表，要人，还要玉米面补贴金。”
    伪军狠声喊：“崩了你们，机关枪点名！”
    孙士荣走上前去，站在机枪面前说：“你们崩，就崩我吧！”
    合丝的女工齐淑花也走上前去夺机枪，没夺到，就指着伪军的鼻子大骂道：“你们吃我们，喝我们，还来打我们，你们有良心吗？”
    说着大伙都往前冲去，他们一看，机关枪也不管事，就由王梦孚出来说话了：
    “你们的代表跟厂长研究事儿了，等明天就回来！”
    大伙都说：“不行，现在就要我们的人出来！”
    我们上前把伪工会的冯佩如、王梦孚包围了，问他们：“你们穿大褂的是干嘛的，不给我们工人办事。”
    冯佩如说：“你们先回去干活，代表在下午四点就放出来！”
    “不行！”我们齐声喊：“不见人不回去！”
    他们没法子，只得把扣起的代表放了出来，代表孙世琚和张家枢一同走出来，我们就一涌上前，拉着他们的手，真有说不出的高兴，每个人都鼓着掌，走到他们面前。
    孙世琚就跳上了道旁的轱辘马对大家讲话：“兄弟姐妹们，我们是为大伙办事的，可是厂里想把我们押走，要不是你们大伙出来，就把我们送走了，今后咱们要更加齐心。反正豁着我的脑袋也不怕，咱厂的工会不给咱工人办事，反来镇压咱，咱们要团结起来，打倒喝我们血的工会！”
    我们就全都高声喊：“打倒吸血工会，选我们自己的代表！”
    这天下午，我们回到车间就成立了推翻伪工会的组织，车间里到处贴上了标语，我们自己还编了快板贴在显眼的地方。
    两个月以后，我们选举了工人自己的工会，把孙世琚、张家枢都选成了工会代表，推翻了伪工会。
