Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 9th: The US military command continued to reinforce its troops in Lebanon over the past 24 hours, and transported a large number of military technical equipment. The landing troops occupied the high ground in the southern suburbs of Beirut and many other strongholds. American troops are advancing along the Mediterranean coast towards the city of Damour, south of Beirut.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 9th: Large groups of officers and soldiers of the American invading army have broken into the city of Beirut to "enjoy themselves freely." In the city's taverns, cafes, bars, and restaurants, as well as on the beaches near the city, these American soldiers can be seen drinking, loitering, and molesting women everywhere.

The headquarters of the US aggressor troops in Lebanon announced on August 8th that, starting from the 9th, two thousand officers and soldiers of the American invading army would be allowed to enter the city of Beirut every day.

At present, the number of American invading soldiers on the streets of Beirut is greater than the number of Lebanese government troops. The total number of US aggressor troops in Lebanon has reached about three times the total number of Lebanese government troops, and it is still increasing.
