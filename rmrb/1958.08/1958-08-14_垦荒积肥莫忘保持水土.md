　　Reclaiming Land and Accumulating Fertilizer: Don't Forget to Maintain Water and Soil
    We discovered in northern Hubei that many high hills or low mountains (with slopes of 10°—15°), whose relatively gentle tops or waists have already been cultivated and utilized, are mostly opened up along the slope. We believe that it is not appropriate to reclaim wasteland on such barren and coarse hilly land (with only 5-10 cm of topsoil). Some have even plowed the weathered rock subsoil to the surface. This is not only detrimental to crop growth but will also promote erosion and soil erosion.
    We also found that many commune members are digging up a lot of sod on some low mountain land to make compost. Digging up sod to make compost certainly has fertilizing effects, but considering long-term interests, we believe this method of accumulating fertilizer is inappropriate. The soil layer in this hilly area is extremely thin, and the forest is extremely sparse (destroyed by the Japanese invaders). Some areas are entirely wasteland, and the slopes are relatively steep. If the sod is destroyed, it will cause more serious sheet erosion and gully erosion in the future, exacerbating soil erosion and water loss. According to field soil surveys and observations, many mountains and hills have become bare mountains with exposed rocks due to vegetation destruction. This method of land use, which only cares about immediate interests and ignores future consequences, is unreasonable and contradicts the Party and government's call for greening mountains and conserving water and soil. In order to prevent the intensification of soil erosion and water loss, these two problems deserve the attention of local governments and agricultural production cooperatives.

### 垦荒积肥莫忘保持水土

　　垦荒积肥莫忘保持水土
    我们在湖北北部曾发现有许多高丘或低山（坡度10°—15°），比较平缓的顶部或腰部目前已经耕翻垦荒利用，并且大部分是顺坡开，我们认为在这样瘠薄粗骨性山丘地上开荒（表土仅5—10公分），不太适宜。有的把岩石半风体都耕翻于地面了，这样不但对作物生长不利，相反会促进冲刷和水土流失。
    我们还发现好多社员都在一些低山地大量铲草皮做堆肥。铲下草皮做堆肥当然是有肥效的，但是从长远利益来考虑，我们认为这样积肥不恰当。这一带丘陵地的土层极薄，林木极稀（日寇破坏掉），有的全为荒草地，而且坡度较陡。如果把草皮破坏，将来会引起更严重的面蚀和沟蚀，加剧水土流失。据野外土壤调查观察到好多山地和丘陵，由于植被破坏，现在已成为岩石裸露的光山。这种只顾眼前利益而忽视将来后果的山地利用办法是不合理的，同时与党和政府号召绿化山地及水土保持是相违背的。为了防止水土流失加剧，这两个问题值得当地政府和农业生产合作社注意。
