　　Emphasize the Collection and Protection of Revolutionary Cultural Relics
　　During the Anti-Japanese War period, Qingpu County in Jiangsu Province was one of the most active areas of armed struggle in the Jiangnan region. The people of Qingpu actively participated in various struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, there are very rich historical materials of revolutionary struggle and a large number of valuable revolutionary cultural relics here. We have collected valuable revolutionary cultural relics in only three places, namely Huancheng Chengbei Cooperative, Chonggu Township, and Guanyintang Township, including: two homemade guns used in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Qingpu during the Great Revolution of 1927, rifles, broadswords, and bullets used by the New Fourth Army during the Anti-Japanese War, a mimeograph machine used by the underground armed forces, and a kettle used by Comrade Gu Fusheng, one of the leaders of the Qingpu area, at that time, and so on. These revolutionary cultural relics were preserved by the local people at the risk of their lives.
　　The Party led the people in the Land Revolution, the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Anti-Japanese War, and the War of Liberation. There are many moving heroic deeds and many extremely valuable revolutionary cultural relics in various places. I hope that museum workers and cultural workers in various places can universally collect and protect these precious revolutionary cultural relics.

　　重视征集和保护革命文物
    江苏省青浦县在抗日时期是江南地区武装斗争最活跃的地区之一。青浦人民积极参与在共产党领导下的各项斗争。因而，在这里有着很丰富的革命斗争史料和大量的有价值的革命文物。我们仅仅在环城城北社、重固乡、观音堂乡等三个地方征集到的有价值的革命文物有：1927年大革命时期青浦举行秋收起义时用的两支土枪，抗日时期新四军所使用的步枪、大刀、子弹，地下武装使用的油印机，青浦地区领导人之一——顾复生同志当时所使用的水壶等等。这些革命文物都是当地人民冒着生命危险保存下来的。
    党领导人民进行过土地革命、第二次国内革命战争、抗日和解放战争，各地都有许多可歌可泣的英雄史迹，也有许多极有价值的革命文物。我希望博物馆工作者和各地文化工作者，能普遍地征集和保护这些珍贵的革命文物。上海市历史与建设博物馆　魏以昌
