Data: U.S. Direct and Indirect Aggression Against Latin American Countries

In his speech to the Emergency Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, Eisenhower made no mention of the withdrawal of Anglo-American aggressor troops from the Middle East. Instead, he resorted to hypocritical phrases such as "helping small countries maintain independence" and "stopping direct or indirect aggression," stubbornly labeling the Lebanese people's struggle against the traitorous dictator Chamoun and the Jordanian people's righteous struggle against the puppet tyrant Hussein as "indirect aggression" and "foreign instigation." In fact, it would have been better not to mention "indirect aggression" at all. Bringing it up only puts the debt for these instances of direct and "indirect aggression" on the U.S. account. To say nothing of other things, the U.S. has committed a series of direct or "indirect aggression" crimes against the Latin American people, its close neighbors, who have suffered greatly from U.S. aggression and plunder.

The U.S. has a blood-soaked history in Latin American countries, from inciting riots and creating coups to subvert legitimate governments, to openly carrying out armed aggression against them. After the war, in the ten years from 1948 to 1958 alone, the U.S. carried out more than ten major subversive activities in more than half of the Latin American countries.

After U.S. troops invaded Lebanon on July 15, the U.S. simultaneously carried out subversive activities and armed intervention in three Latin American countries.

On July 22, the U.S. plotted a coup in Venezuela aimed at restoring a pro-American dictatorial regime. A group of reactionary military officers, led by Defense Minister Castro Leon, issued an ultimatum to the ruling military junta, demanding that the Venezuelan Communist Party and Democratic Action Party be declared illegal. They also demanded that the general election be postponed and that censorship be implemented. The Venezuelan people, who had just driven out the traitorous dictator Jimenez six months earlier, crushed the coup, and the rebel officers fled to the United States.

On July 29, in the black republic of Haiti, the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti, Drew, instigated a military riot aimed at overthrowing the Haitian government. The U.S. Air Force attaché in Haiti and some Americans directly participated in the armed attack. After the riot was suppressed by the Haitian authorities, the Haitian president accused the U.S. of plotting the coup as a kind of international banditry.

On July 31, in Cuba, the U.S. Marines, undermining Cuban sovereignty, and using the pretext of protecting the water system of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo in Oriente Province, militarily occupied the Cuban province of Oriente in order to protect the precarious Batista puppet regime.

These three new counts in the U.S.'s ugly history of subversive activities in Latin America, coupled with the U.S. troops' stubborn refusal to leave Lebanon, amount to a sharp slap in the face for U.S. national leaders who are shouting about stopping "direct or indirect aggression."

The U.S. treats Latin America as its own "backyard" and tries to turn Latin American countries into its own colonies. To this end, it desperately subverts governments that are supported by their own people or that do not suit the U.S. It supports those agents who sell out national independence and guarantee that U.S. imperialists can extract huge profits.

The U.S.'s armed intervention to subvert the democratic government led by Arbenz in Guatemala in June 1954 is one example. The Arbenz government implemented land reform, distributing the uncultivated land of the U.S. United Fruit Company and large landowners to the peasants, building ports, power stations, and roads with its own strength, and adopting an independent foreign policy, which aroused the hatred of the U.S. The U.S. then drove its lackey Armas to invade from Honduras, overthrowing the Arbenz democratic government and establishing a regime that was completely submissive to the U.S. United Fruit Company.

Less than two months later, the U.S.'s evil claws reached into Brazil, forcing Brazilian President Vargas to commit suicide. During Vargas's term in office, he had pursued policies that conformed to the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, resulting in U.S. trusts' profits in Brazil reaching fifty times the amount of their investment. However, as the Brazilian people's movement to get rid of the enslavement of foreign monopoly capital and strive for independence grew stronger, Vargas was unable to stop the development of patriotic forces, and he had to take some measures that were more in line with national interests. In 1953 and the first half of 1954, the Vargas government announced that it would not allow foreign capital to interfere in Brazil's oil production, promulgated a decree doubling the minimum wage, and took some measures aimed at restricting imports and reducing the profits of some foreign companies. As a result, U.S. monopoly groups believed that Vargas did not have enough "魄力" (backbone/resolution) and colluded with their lackeys in Brazil to force Vargas to step down and find another puppet to replace him. The seventy-one-year-old president was forced to commit suicide, leaving behind a bloody last testament accusing foreign monopoly groups of enslaving Brazil.

The U.S.'s actions in Cuba are even more despicable. In the ongoing armed uprising of the Cuban people against the dictatorial and traitorous Batista government, the U.S. is taking a two-faced approach, taking advantage of the dispersed nature of the Cuban insurgent forces. On the one hand, it supports Batista, and on the other hand, it retains several of Batista's opponents as a reserve for establishing colonial tools, attempting to eliminate the essence of the Cuban people's democratic struggle from the complex struggle.

In addition, the political disturbances that have occurred in Peru, El Salvador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Chile, and other countries after the war have all been related to the U.S.'s planning and instigation. These direct and "indirect aggression" crimes committed by the U.S. have long been exposed in broad daylight, and the people of the world can see them clearly. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美国对拉丁美洲国家的直接和间接侵略

　　美国对拉丁美洲国家的直接和间接侵略
    艾森豪威尔在联合国大会紧急会议的演说中，只字不提美英侵略军撤出中东的问题，却在玩弄“帮助小国维持独立”、“制止直接或间接侵略”等等虚伪的词句，硬要把黎巴嫩人民反对卖国独夫夏蒙的斗争和约旦人民反对傀儡暴君侯赛因的正义斗争诬为“间接侵略”和“外国煽动”。其实，不提“间接侵略”还则罢了。提起此事，这一笔笔的直接和“间接侵略”的债务都记在美国的账户上。别的不说，单是美国对近邻它的深受美国侵略和掠夺之害的拉丁美洲人民，就犯下了一连串直接或“间接侵略”的罪行。
    美国有着在拉丁美洲各国从煽动暴乱、制造政变以颠复合法政府，直到对它们进行公开武装侵略的臭气冲天的血腥历史。战后，仅仅从1948年到1958年的十年间，美国在一半以上的拉丁美洲国家干了十多次重大的颠复活动。
    7月15日，美国军队侵入黎巴嫩以后，美国同时又在三个拉丁美洲国家进行了颠复活动和武装干涉。
    7月22日，美国在委内瑞拉策划了一个目的在于使亲美独裁政权复辟的阴谋政变，一批以国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂为首的反动军人，向执政的军政府发出最后通牒，要求宣布委内瑞拉共产党和民主行动党为非法，还要求推迟普选日期和实行新闻检查。刚刚在六个月前赶走希门尼斯卖国独裁政权的委内瑞拉人民粉碎了这次政变，叛乱军官逃往美国。
  7月29日，在黑人共和国海地，美国驻海地大使德鲁策动了目的在于推翻海地政府的军事暴乱，美国驻海地空军武官和一些美国人直接参加了武装进攻。暴乱被海地当局镇压下去以后，海地总统指责美国策划的这次政变阴谋，是一种国际土匪行为。
    7月31日在古巴，美国海军陆战队，破坏古巴的主权，以保护奥连特省关塔那摩美国海军基地的用水系统为借口，对古巴奥连特省实行军事占领，以便保护岌岌可危的巴蒂斯塔傀儡政权。
    美国在拉丁美洲颠复活动丑史上的这三笔新账，加上美国军队死赖在黎巴嫩，对于高喊制止“直接或间接侵略”的美国国家领导人，无异于一记清脆的耳光。
    美国把拉丁美洲当作自己的“后院”，力图把拉丁美洲各国变成自己的殖民地，为此，它竭力颠复那些受本国人民拥护或者不合美国心意的政府；它支持那些出卖民族独立、保证美帝国主义者榨取巨额利润的代理人。
    1954年6月，美国以武装干涉颠复了危地马拉阿本斯领导的民主政府，就是一个例证。阿本斯政府实行了土地改革，把美国联合果品公司和大地主的荒废土地分给农民，用本国力量修建港口、发电站和公路，采取独立的外交政策，因而遭到美国的仇视。美国就驱使走狗阿马斯从洪都拉斯引兵入侵，推翻了阿本斯民主政府，建立起完全屈服于美国联合果品公司的政权。
    这以后，不到两个月，美国魔掌又伸入了巴西，迫使巴西总统瓦加斯自杀。瓦加斯执政期间，曾经奉行符合美国垄断资本利益的政策，致使美国托辣斯在巴西的利润达到投资额的五十倍。只是由于巴西广大人民要求摆脱外国垄断资本奴役、争取独立运动日益澎湃，瓦加斯无法阻止爱国力量的发展，他不得不采取一些比较合乎民族利益的措施。1953年和1954年上半年，瓦加斯政府宣布不准外资插手巴西的石油生产，颁布将最低工资提高一倍的法令，并采取某些旨在限制输入和减少一些外国公司利润的措施。这样一来，美国垄断集团就认为瓦加斯“魄力”不够，串通他们在巴西的走狗，一道威逼瓦加斯下台，另找一个傀儡代替他。这位七十一岁的总统被迫自杀，留下一封控诉外国垄断集团奴役巴西血泪斑斑的遗书。
    美国在古巴的作法，更加卑劣。在目前正在进行的反对巴蒂斯塔独裁卖国政府的古巴人民武装起义中，美国利用古巴起义力量分散的情况，采取两面手法：一面支持巴蒂斯塔，一面又保留几个巴蒂斯塔的对手作为建立殖民工具的后备。企图从复杂的斗争中消灭古巴人民民主斗争的精华。
    此外、战后在秘鲁、萨尔瓦多、巴拉圭、哥斯达黎加、玻利维亚、墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、智利等国所发生的政治骚动，也无一不同美国的策划和煽动有关。美国犯下的这些直接和“间接侵略”的罪行早已暴露在光天化日之下，全世界人民都看得清清楚楚。（新华社）
