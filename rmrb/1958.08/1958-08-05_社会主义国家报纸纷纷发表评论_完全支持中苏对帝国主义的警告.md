Xinhua News Agency, August 4th. The recent talks in Beijing between Chinese and Soviet leaders Mao Zedong and Khrushchev, and the communiqué issued on the results of the talks, have become the focus of attention today for the public opinion of various fraternal socialist countries.

The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" and "People's Youth" newspapers both published the full text of the Mao Zedong and Khrushchev meeting communiqué on the front page today.

"People's Youth" wrote in an editorial entitled "Great Unity of Great Peoples" that all mankind welcomes the news of the meeting between Comrades Khrushchev and Mao Zedong with great interest. The Bulgarian people, along with the people of the world, fully support the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China's severe condemnation of the United States and Britain's armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.

The editorial said that all fighters struggling for communism are constantly drawing new strength and being encouraged by the firm will clearly expressed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China. These two parties resolutely expressed their determination to defend their sacred unity, safeguard of the purity of Marxism-Leninism, defend the principles of the Moscow Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against the main danger in the communist movement, revisionism – which is clearly manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

In Bucharest, the capital of Romania, the only evening newspaper "Message," which did not take a holiday today, published the full text of the Mao Zedong and Khrushchev meeting communiqué in large characters and in the most prominent position on the front page. Bucharest Radio has been broadcasting the full text of the communiqué and news about the meeting continuously since the afternoon of August 3rd.

The Polish "People's Tribune" and "Freedom Fighter" newspapers both published the full text of the Khrushchev and Mao Zedong meeting communiqué on the front page today in large characters.

The headline of the "People's Tribune" was: "The Soviet Union and China Demand an Immediate High-Level Meeting, Demand the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops from Lebanon and Jordan, Support the Struggle of the Arab People, and Warn Against Expanding Aggression."

Other newspapers in Warsaw today published summaries of the meeting communiqué.

In Hungary, the only newspaper in Budapest that did not take a holiday today, "Monday News," published a detailed summary of the meeting communiqué on the front page. The newspaper's headline pointed out that the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples is constantly strengthening; a summit conference of major governments must be convened immediately to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue.

In Democratic Korea, the only newspaper that did not take a holiday today, "Democratic Korea," also published the Mao Zedong and Khrushchev meeting communiqué in a prominent position.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th. The Vietnamese Labor Party's organ newspaper, "People's Daily," published an editorial today entitled "The Strong Backing and Great Source of Faith for All Mankind," expressing a warm welcome to the Khrushchev and Mao Zedong meeting communiqué, and fully agreeing with and thoroughly supporting this important communiqué.

The editorial said that in our era, the decisive factor in the development of the entire situation is the existence of the socialist camp. The core of this camp is the Soviet Union and China. These two countries are advancing vigorously by leaps and bounds. The strength of the socialist camp has far surpassed the strength of imperialism. Their strength is sufficient to prevent war, and once war breaks out, the socialist countries will, together with the people of the world, eliminate imperialism forever.

The editorial continued, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are at all times the core of all peaceful forces in the world, and at all times stand on the side of all nations opposing aggression and defending national independence. Therefore, the Soviet Union and China are at all times the strong backing and great source of faith for all mankind, especially when the current world situation is at a turning point between peace and war.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 4th. Today, the Berlin democratic district newspapers "Forward" ("New Germany" Monday edition), "Tribune," and "Youth World" all published the Mao Zedong and Khrushchev meeting communiqué in a front-page headline position, and published photos of the two leaders.

The headline of "Forward" was "The Soviet Union and People's China Condemn the Aggressors," with the sub-headline "Khrushchev Meets with Mao Zedong in Beijing, Complete Agreement, Demand an Immediate Top-Level Meeting on the Middle East."

The editorial of "Forward" wrote that the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev in Beijing "once again put forward the demand for a peaceful resolution of international issues, which is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries in the world."

The editorial said, "The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East means that the danger of war is increasing. Therefore, this warning from Beijing is not accidental, it illustrates what will happen to imperialism if they continue their policies for a long time."
