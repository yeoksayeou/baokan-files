　　“Field Combat Platoon” Plays a Significant Role
　　—Introducing the Experience of the Spark Society in Organizing a Labor Force that Combines Industry, Agriculture, and Military Affairs
　　Li Wenshan
　　The Huoguang (Spark) Agricultural Cooperative in Daganan, Beitian Township, Yuci, with 127 households and 224 male and female full and semi-laborers, cultivates more than 3,800 mu of land. In previous years, there was a constant shortage of labor. This year, the labor shortage in this cooperative is even more serious. On the one hand, the cooperative's production tasks have increased; on the other hand, this year, the task of transferring labor to support industrial and agricultural construction in other areas has also increased. Since June, a total of 33 cooperative members, all strong and able-bodied full laborers, have been transferred to factories, mines, and water conservancy construction sites in other townships and counties.
　　After the labor force decreased, production was indeed affected to some extent. After the harvest of 1,020 mu of wheat, only the first round of threshing was done roughly. As a result, continuous days of rain caused all the unthreshed wheat to sprout. During the two days of wheat harvesting, many tasks such as harvesting, replanting, and weeding were crammed together, and each production team was preoccupied with one thing and unable to attend to another. The cooperative originally planned to replant all the wheat fields after the harvest, but because of the shortage of manpower, they couldn't manage, and more than 300 mu were not planted. At the same time, many major autumn crops had to be weeded ten days later than planned.
　　The cooperative cadres thought: In the future, agricultural production must leap forward again and again, and industrial production will also continue to draw people from the countryside, so the problem of labor shortage must be solved. Therefore, a meeting of cooperative members was held to discuss, and everyone unanimously agreed that in the case of labor shortage, a shock force should be established to be responsible for storming the cooperative's important tasks and to actively respond to the task of transferring labor. After the minds of all the cadres and members of the cooperative were unified, they immediately began to improve the organization of labor after the summer harvest.
　　The cooperative was originally divided into five production teams. The cooperative decided that these five teams would remain, and the system of determining work based on output would remain unchanged. However, 166 young and middle-aged male and female laborers were drawn from these five teams to organize two shock teams. One team, called the "Field Combat Platoon," has 66 participants, including male laborers aged 18 to 45 and female laborers aged 20 to 25 who are strong and unencumbered. This is the backbone and "field army" of the shock force. The cooperative requires them to complete two tasks: first, to undertake the most difficult work of the cooperative; second, to be ready to go to other places to support industrial and agricultural production and construction at any time. The other team, called the "Local Platoon," has 100 participants, including male laborers aged 16 to 17 and 46 to 50, and female laborers aged 16 to 45. This is the cooperative's "local force." The cooperative assigned them the task of being responsible for the general field labor of the cooperative; under normal circumstances, they still work in teams, and when necessary, they also organize the entire platoon for major assaults. In addition to these two shock teams, the remaining semi-auxiliary laborers, the old, weak, and disabled, and children were also organized by the cooperative into a "logistics force" and assigned to various minor labor tasks.
　　The "Field Combat Platoon" is also a labor organization that combines industry, agriculture, and military affairs. When establishing this team, the cooperative clearly stated that the 58 young and middle-aged male laborers participating in the "Field Combat Platoon" are all the "reserve worker" targets for this year. How many are transferred by the higher authorities, that many will go, and whoever should go, will go. In order to ensure that labor can be delivered to industrial and mining enterprises on time, all members of the "Field Combat Platoon" used democratic appraisal methods to determine Pang Simao, Wang Wuhuo, and other eight young people as the first batch of "reserve workers." These eight people all have the conditions of being ideologically advanced, having a basic understanding of literacy, and being healthy. Among the eight people, four are members of the Communist Youth League. After the specific targets of the first batch of "reserve workers" were determined, the cooperative further proposed that no one should be uneasy about agricultural production just because they are "reserve workers"; if anyone is not at ease working in the cooperative, their "reserve worker" qualification will be cancelled. In the "Field Combat Platoon," except for six young women, all are core militia and general militia, so it is also a militarized organization. Under the platoon, three squads were established, and the platoon and squad cadres were all served by the cadres of the original militia backbone team. Their system is that whether they are working in the cooperative or outside the cooperative, they must maintain "three-izations," namely, organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization.
　　After these two shock forces were formally formed and put into production according to the cooperative's allocation, the Huoguang Cooperative's difficulty in labor shortage was quickly overcome. The people of the "Local Platoon" "divided their forces to guard the passes" and took over the daily operations of each team, while the energetic "Field Combat Platoon" took on the shock tasks of the entire cooperative. When the autumn seedlings were top-dressed for the first time, the cooperative had a shortage of fertilizer, so the "Field Combat Platoon" launched a shock accumulation of fertilizer; they accumulated fertilizer in the village and in the fields during the day, and even lit gasoline lamps at night to dig dung cellars. After four days and four nights of hard work, they accumulated more than 20,000 dan of fertilizer and built five man-made fertilizer cellars, each of which can produce 4,000 dan of fertilizer every ten days. The phenomenon of fertilizer shortage was quickly changed. The cooperative planned to divert floodwater to irrigate the crops, but the canals were not built, so it organized the "Field Combat Platoon" to complete this task. The people of the "Field Combat Platoon" worked continuously for seven days and seven nights, digging eight water canals, and the problem of diverting floodwater to irrigate 3,000 mu of land was solved in one fell swoop. According to the statistics for the month of July, the labor efficiency of the "Field Combat Platoon" increased by 45% compared with the production quota, and the average person could earn 14 work points per day, with a maximum of 17.6 work points per day. Many of the tasks that had been delayed in the past have been caught up, and some tasks have even caught up with the front of other cooperatives. The second weeding of 2,000 mu of major autumn crops was originally planned to be completed in 20 days, with a shortage of more than 280 man-days. Thanks to the vigorous assault of the "Field Combat Platoon" and the strong cooperation of the "Local Platoon," this task was completed in only 18 and a half days.
　　The birth of the "Field Combat Platoon" has opened up a broad path for vigorously implementing the policy of "combining labor and military affairs" and more quickly improving the military skills of core militia and general militia. Every day at 4:00 a.m., the bugle for the "Field Combat Platoon" would sound, and then the core militia and other members of the "Field Combat Platoon" living together would quickly gather together, first run for 30 minutes, and then complete the assault tasks assigned to them by the cooperative in a combat posture. On the walls all over the village, the core militia members painted more than 80 street targets, requiring each militia backbone member to aim three shots before and after meals. Every day when going to the fields, they must bring weapons and live targets. They practice footwork while walking, turning techniques in the fields, and during breaks, they set up live targets to practice aiming and various shooting postures. At night, they are divided into four groups to study culture and military common sense. Their slogan is: "Practice martial arts to defend the country and be a hero, transform nature and be a pioneer, combine labor and military affairs for a complete victory, and ensure a yield of 1,000 catties per mu." In more than a month, all core militia members have achieved excellent results in both labor and military training. The core militia members have held two live ammunition shooting exercises in conjunction with production, and the results were all qualified, with 94.7% of the people reaching the excellent and good standards. Core militia member Chang Tielin can earn 17 work points for labor during the day, and during lunch and evening breaks, he made seven wooden guns, 20 tripods, and eight hand grenades for the militia members. His family raises five pigs, and every day when he comes back from the fields, he also brings back a basket of wild vegetables.

　　“野战排”起了重大作用
　　——介绍火光社组织亦工亦农亦兵劳动大军的经验
　　李文珊
    榆次北田乡大伽南火光农业社，一百二十七户社员，二百二十四个男女全半劳动力，耕种着三千八百多亩土地，往常年，就不断发生劳动力不足的现象。今年，这个社劳动力不足的现象就更加严重了。一方面是本社的生产任务加大；另一方面，今年，调动劳动力去支援外地工农业建设的任务也加大了。6月以来，全社先后被调往工厂、矿山和外乡、外县水利建设工地上的社员，已达三十三个，而且都是身强力壮的全劳力。
    劳动力减少以后，生产上也确实受到了一些影响。一千零二十亩小麦收割以后，只粗粗地打了头场，结果，一连几天连阴雨，没有打净的小麦，全都生了芽子。收麦那两天，收麦、复播、锄苗等许多营生都挤在一起，各个生产队都是顾了这顾不了那；社里原计划麦田收割后要全部复播，因为人手少，顾不过来，有三百多亩就没有种上。同时，有很多大秋作物也不得不迟锄十来天。
    社干部们想到：今后，农业生产要跃进再跃进，工业生产也还会不断地从农村抽人，劳动力不足的问题必须想办法解决。于是召开社员大会讨论，大家一致认为在劳动力不足的情况下，应当建立一支突击力量，让他们负责突击本社的重要工作，并主动应付外调劳力的任务。全社干部、社员的思想达到统一，夏收以后，便立即着手改进劳动力的组织工作。
    全社原来分为五个生产队。社里决定，这五个队仍然保持，以产定工的制度也依然不变。只是从这五个队里抽出一百六十六个青壮年男女劳动力，组织起两支突击队伍。其中一支叫“野战排”，共有六十六人参加，它包括十八岁到四十五岁的男劳力和二十岁到二十五岁的、身强力壮而且没有拖累的女劳力。这是突击力量中的骨干和“野战军”。社里要求他们完成两方面的任务：第一，担负本社最艰巨的工作；第二，随时准备，到外地去支援工农业生产建设。另一支叫“地方排”，共有一百人参加，它包括了十六岁到十七岁、四十六岁到五十岁的男劳力，和十六岁到四十五岁的女劳力。这是社里的“地方部队”。社里分配给他们的任务是，负责本社的一般田间劳动；在一般情况下，仍然以队为单位工作，必要时，也组织全排大突击。除过这两支突击队伍，剩下，就是半辅劳动力和老弱残废、小孩子，社里也把他们组织起来，叫做“后勤部队”，分配他们担任各种轻微的劳动。
    “野战排”同时也是一个亦工亦农亦兵的劳动力组织。在建立这支队伍的时候，社里就明确提出：参加“野战排”的五十八个青壮年男劳力，都是本年度的“预备工”对象，上级调动多少，就走多少，该谁去，谁就去。为了保证能按时给工矿企业输送劳动力，“野战排”的全体成员，以民主评议的办法，确定庞四毛、王五货等八个青年为第一批“预备工”。这八个人都具有思想进步、粗通文字和身体健康等条件，八个人中，还有四个是共青团员。第一批“预备工”的具体对象确定之后，社里又提出任何人都不能因为自己是“预备工”便不安心农业生产；如果谁不安心在社里劳动，就取消他的“预备工”资格。在“野战排”里，除六个女青年外，都是基干民兵和一般民兵，所以，它又是一个军事化的组织。在排之下，建立了三个班，排、班的干部，都由原来的民兵基干队的干部担任。他们的制度是，不论在本社劳动或是到社外劳动，都必须保持“三化”，即组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化。
    这两支突击力量正式形成并按照社里的分配投入生产以后，火光社劳力不足的困难，很快便得到了克服。“地方排”的人们“分兵把口”包起了各队的日常营生，干劲十足的“野战排”，担负起全社的突击任务。秋苗上头次追肥的时候，社里肥料不足，“野战排”就突击积肥；他们白日在村里、地里积，夜晚还要点起汽灯打粪窖。整整苦战四天四夜，积肥两万多担，还打成了五个人造粪窖子，每十天就可以造肥四千担。肥料不足的现象，很快就改变了。社里打算引洪灌溉庄稼，但渠道没有修起，便又组织“野战排”去完成这件工作。“野战排”的人们，一连干了七天七夜，挖水渠八条，三千亩土地引洪灌溉的问题，一举便得到了解决。据7月份一个月的统计，“野战排”的劳动效率，比生产定额提高了45％，平均每人每天都能挣到十四分工，最高的一天可以挣到十七分六。过去拉下的许多营生，都已经赶上去，有一些营生，并且已经赶到了其它社的前面。两千亩大秋作物上二锄，原计划在二十天内完成，尚缺二百八十多人工。由于“野战排”的大力突击，加上“地方排”的大力配合，结果，只用了十八天半的时间，这个任务就完成了。
    “野战排”的诞生，为大力贯彻“劳武结合”的方针，更快地提高基干民兵和一般民兵的军事素养，也开辟了一条广阔的道路。每天凌晨四时，“野战排”的起床号便吹响了，接着，居住在一起的基干民兵及“野战排”的其他成员，就迅速集合在一起，先跑步三十分钟，然后就以战斗的姿态，去完成社里所给予他们的突击任务。在全村各处墙壁上，基干民兵们画了八十多个街头靶，要求每个民兵基干队员饭前饭后瞄三枪。每天上地，都要带上武器和活靶。走路练步法，地头练转法，休息下，就支起活靶练习瞄准和各种射击姿势。夜晚，还要分成四个小组学习文化和军事常识。他们的口号是：“练武卫国当英雄，改造自然当尖兵，劳武结合满堂红，亩产千斤有保证。”一个多月来，全体基干民兵在劳动、练武两方面都取得了优异的成绩。基干民兵们结合生产举行过两次实弹射击，结果是全部及格，并有94.7％的人达到优秀、良好的标准。基干民兵常铁林，白天劳动能挣十七分工，利用中午、晚上休息时间给民兵们做了七枝木枪、二十个三角架、八个手榴弹。他家养猪五口，每天从地回来时，还要捎着挖一筐野菜。
