Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: TASS, Moscow, August 30th telegram: TASS statement:

    The so-called Baghdad Pact Council held a meeting in London from July 28 to 29. The meeting was attended by the British Prime Minister, the Turkish Prime Minister, the Iranian Prime Minister and the Pakistani Prime Minister, as well as U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. The participants in this meeting did not include representatives from Iraq, which Western countries had hoped to use its membership in this group to attract other Arab countries to participate in the military and political measures of the United States and Britain in the Middle East. The Iraqi revolution eliminated the Nuri al-Said traitorous clique that dragged Iraq into the Baghdad Pact, and the young Republic of Iraq embarked on the road of independent development after breaking away from the shackles of colonialism.

    **The United States Has Openly Appeared as the Head of the Aggressive Bloc**

    In order to save the aggressive bloc from complete disintegration, the United States had to tear off its mask and express its willingness to fully assume the obligations arising from this treaty. As everyone knows, the United States has been directly involved in the main institutions of this organization for a long time. It is the main supplier of armaments to the member states of this treaty and bears the vast majority of the expenses required for the implementation of war preparations within the scope of this treaty. The United States has long squeezed Britain into a secondary position, while Britain had hoped to consolidate its colonialist positions in the Middle East by establishing the Baghdad Pact. In fact, the United States is the leader of the Baghdad Pact and directs all its activities. It can be seen that if the United States had previously directed from behind the scenes, it is now openly appearing as the head of the aggressive bloc serving the interests of the colonialists.

    The meeting adopted a special statement, which was signed by all participants, including "observer" Dulles. In addition, a brief communique was also adopted. Almost every line of the statement emphasizes that the meeting participants seem to only care about "strengthening defense," "maintaining collective security," and "resisting aggression," etc. At present, when the whole world has seen the U.S. and British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, all these words of security and defense sound particularly hypocritical.

    **The U.S., Britain, and Their Accomplices Plotted Further Expansion of Aggression at the Meeting**

    In the communique, the meeting participants shamelessly and openly endorsed the U.S. and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and unambiguously expressed their readiness to expand the scope of aggression in the Middle East.

    In order to justify the act of interfering in the internal affairs of Arab Eastern countries, the London meeting participants described the struggle of the people of Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan for their national independence as "indirect aggression," despite the fact that only direct aggression by the United States and Britain actually exists.

    After studying the statement and the communique, the following questions arise: Against whose aggression are the member states of the Baghdad Pact preparing to resist? And who is threatening their security and independence? What exactly is hidden behind this high-sounding so-called concern for "collective security"? It should be known that even the Americans themselves admit that the Arab armies cannot be a threat to the member states of the Baghdad Pact.

    If this is the case, then what were the representatives of the United States, Britain, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan doing at the meeting in London? The facts clearly show that the London meeting was actually nothing more than a gathering of conspirators who conspired to launch new aggressions against Arab countries that had only recently embarked on the road of independent development, primarily the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq. After the U.S. and Britain launched armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, they are now plotting with their Baghdad Pact accomplices to further expand their aggression.

    **The Aggressive Bloc is Moving Troops and Deploying Generals, and the Middle East Faces a Serious Threat of War**

    U.S. troops are still continuing to enter Lebanon. According to newspaper reports, a batch of U.S. transport planes arrives at Khaled Airport every five minutes, and new ammunition and supply depots are constantly being built in Lebanon. More than seventy warships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet are patrolling near the coast of Lebanon. A large number of military aircraft are stationed on these warships, ready to be put into battle at any time.

    In Turkey, more than 150 U.S. military aircraft, including the latest "Super Sabre F-100" jet fighters and "B-57" bombers, have been concentrated in the Adana region, only a few minutes' flight from the Syrian border. U.S. troops and military equipment are also being continuously transported to Adana. The Turkish troops, which were originally dispersed in Iskenderun, are rapidly moving towards the border of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic. Turkish troops are also gathering on the Iraqi border. At the same time, Turkey is mobilizing reservists. The Turkish national leaders even believe that it is not necessary to conceal that all these measures are preparations for an attack on the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu recently spoke about this publicly.

    Since July 16, large quantities of "special purpose goods" and groups of American "travelers" have been hurriedly transported from NATO military bases in West Germany and elsewhere to Iran. There are reports that these "travelers" are soldiers in disguise. All these "travelers" were immediately dispatched to Tisful, Kermanshah, and other cities bordering Iran and Iraq. Iran is also summoning reservists and mobilizing major units.

    British troops are gathering in the Persian Gulf region south of Iraq. For example, the 24th Infantry Brigade has been transferred from Kenya to the Bahrain Islands. British troops have landed in the emirates of Lahej, Kuwait, and Oman.

    The number of British paratroopers in Jordan is constantly increasing, and has now reached more than 5,000. Under the direction of foreign protectors, King Hussein of Jordan is baring his fangs and claws and openly stating that he is ready to march into Iraq with the help of interventionist troops.

    Although Israel is not formally a member of the Baghdad Pact, it is blatantly supporting the aggressive measures of Western countries, allowing the United States and Britain to use its territory to transport troops and military equipment, and is also implementing mobilization measures.

    Based on these facts, it is very obvious how great the danger faced by the people of the Middle East is, and for whose interests the Asian countries of this aggressive bloc are serving. However, it is these countries' governments themselves, not others, that should draw some conclusions from the events that recently occurred in Iraq.

    **If Iraq is Invaded, Peace-Loving People of All Countries Will Rise Up to Help**

    As everyone knows, Nuri al-Said attempted to use the Iraqi army to suppress the people's movement in another Arab country, but the result was that not only Nuri al-Said himself, but also the entire corrupt system of Iraq, met a very tragic end. Only those who have lost a clear understanding of the current situation in the Middle East and are unwilling to see the trend of the times will embark on the path of military adventure and openly oppose the national liberation movement.

    Just yesterday, when Iraq was still under the rule of traitorous colonialist agents, those representatives of the Baghdad Group were still cheering for Iraq. They attempted to use Iraq as bait in order to drag other Arab countries into this group. Now, when the Iraqi people have taken their destiny into their own hands, the member states of the Baghdad Pact, including the ruling groups of those Muslim countries participating in this treaty, have begun to draw their swords and want to attack the Republic of Iraq, for the simple reason that the Iraqi people are unwilling to wear the yoke of colonial enslavement again, and bravely embark on the road of consolidating their national independence. In this way, how much are the hypocritical words of freedom and human rights, and respect for political and religious beliefs, that Western countries like to talk about worth?

    There is no doubt that if the aggression planned by the participants of the Baghdad Pact against the freedom-loving people of Iraq who are defending their just cause is realized, then other peace-loving people of all countries will rise up to help the invaded country.

    Now everyone can see very clearly that at the moment, just as the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries are making every effort to strive for the convening of a high-level meeting to take emergency measures to ensure a peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Middle East, the participants of the London meeting are formulating new aggressive measures aimed at further exacerbating the military conflict. In this way, the intention of the U.S. and British governments in adopting delaying tactics and evading the immediate convening of a high-level meeting, despite the urgent demands of the people of all countries, is even clearer.

    In view of the above, it is impossible not to remind the governments of the participating countries of the Baghdad Pact that the U.S. and British governments, as well as the ruling groups of the participating countries of the Baghdad Pact who follow the policies of the imperialist countries, bear full responsibility for the further spread of aggression and all the consequences arising therefrom.

    塔斯社就巴格达条约理事会伦敦会议发表的声明
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日电：塔斯社声明：
    所谓的巴格达条约理事会于7月28日到29日在伦敦举行了会议。参加会议的有英国首相、土耳其总理、伊朗首相和巴基斯坦总理以及美国国务卿杜勒斯。这次会议的参加者中没有伊拉克的代表，本来西方国家是指望用伊拉克在这个集团里的会员资格来吸引其他阿拉伯国家参加美国和英国在中近东的军事政治措施的。伊拉克的革命消灭了把伊拉克拉入巴格达条约的努里·赛义德卖国集团，年轻的伊拉克共和国摆脱了殖民主义桎梏后走上了独立发展的道路。
    美国已公开以侵略集团头目的姿态出现
    为了要挽救全面瓦解中的侵略集团，美国不得不扯下假面具，而表示愿意完全承担由这个条约所产生的义务。大家知道，美国直接参加这个组织的主要机构已经有很长时期了，它是这个条约的成员国的军备的主要供应者，并且负担在这个条约范围内实行备战所需的绝大部分开支。美国早已把英国排挤到次要地位，而英国本来是指望能够通过建立巴格达条约来巩固自己在中近东的殖民主义阵地的。实际上美国才是巴格达条约的领导人，并且指挥着它的全部活动。可见，如果说美国在过去还是从幕后进行指挥的话，那末它现在已公开以替殖民主义者的利益服务的侵略集团的头目的姿态出现了。
    会议通过了一项特别声明，全体与会者，包括“观察员”杜勒斯在内，都在上面签了字，此外，还通过了一个简短的公报。声明里几乎每一行都强调指出，会议参加者似乎只关心“加强防御”、“维持集体安全”、“抵抗侵略”等等。在现在，当全世界都看到了美国和英国干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的时候，所有这些安全和防御之类的字眼，听起来使人感到特别虚伪。
    美英和它们的同谋者在会议上策划进一步扩大侵略
    会议参加者在公报中竟厚颜无耻地公然赞同美国和英国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，并且毫不含糊地表示准备扩大在中近东的侵略范围。
    为了替干涉阿拉伯东方国家内政的行为作辩解，伦敦会议参加者竟把伊拉克、黎巴嫩和约旦三国人民为了本民族的独立而进行的斗争说成是“间接侵略”，尽管实际上存在的却只是美国和英国发动了直接侵略。
    研究了声明和公报之后，就产生了这样一些问题：巴格达条约成员国究竟准备抵抗谁的侵略呢？又有谁威胁着他们的安全和独立呢？隐藏在这种冠冕堂皇的所谓关心“集体安全”背后的到底是什么东西呢？要知道，连美国人自己都承认阿拉伯军队不可能是对巴格达条约成员国的威胁。
    既然如此，那末美国、英国、土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦的代表们在伦敦开会是为了什么呢？事实昭然若揭地说明，伦敦会议实际上不外是一群阴谋家的集会，他们阴谋对不久之前才走上独立发展道路的阿拉伯国家、首先是阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国发动新的侵略。美英两国武装干涉了黎巴嫩和约旦之后，现在又同它们巴格达条约的同谋者策划进一步扩大侵略。
    侵略集团正在调兵遣将，中东面临严重战争威胁
    美国军队还在继续开进黎巴嫩。据报纸报道，每五分钟就有一批美国运输机飞抵哈勒德机场，黎巴嫩境内正在不断建筑新的军火军需仓库。美国第六舰队的七十多艘军舰在黎巴嫩的海岸附近巡逻。在这些军舰上停着大批军用飞机，它们随时准备投入战斗。
    在土耳其，在离叙利亚国境只有几分钟飞行航程的亚达那地区集中了一百五十多架美国军用飞机，其中包括最新式的“超佩刀式—100”喷气式歼击机和“B—57型”轰炸机。美国军队和军事技术设备也源源不断地运到亚达那。本来分散配置在伊斯肯德伦的土耳其军队正在急速开往阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的边境。土耳其军队还在伊拉克边境集结。同时，土耳其正在动员后备军人。土耳其的国家领导人甚至认为，没有必要隐瞒这一切措施都是进攻伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的准备工作。土耳其外交部长佐鲁不久之前就公开谈到了这一点。
    7月16日起，开始有大批“特殊用途的货物”以及一群一群的美国“旅行家”从北大西洋公约组织在西德和其他地方的军事基地匆忙地运到伊朗，有消息说，这些“旅行家”是改了装的军人。所有这些“旅行家”立即被派到伊朗和伊拉克接壤的提斯浮尔、基尔曼沙和其他城市去。伊朗也在召集后备军人并调动主要的部队。
    英国军队在伊拉克以南波斯湾地区集结。例如，第二十四步兵旅已经从怯尼亚开到巴林群岛。英国军队已在拉赫杰、科威特和阿曼等酋长国登陆。
    在约旦的英国伞兵人数不断增加，目前已达五千多人。约旦国王侯赛因在外国保护者的指示下张牙舞爪地公然表示，他准备借助干涉者的军队向伊拉克进军。
    以色列虽然形式上不是巴格达条约的参加国，但是却明目张胆地支持西方国家的侵略措施，允许美国和英国假道它的领土运送军队和军事装备，并且也在实行动员措施。
    根据这些事实可以很明显地看出，中近东人民面临的危险究竟有多大，这个侵略集团的亚洲国家倒底是在为谁的利益服务。但是，不是别人，而正是这些国家的政府不妨从伊拉克不久之前发生的事件给自己得出某种结论。
    伊拉克如受侵略，爱好和平的各国人民将奋起援助
    大家知道，努里·赛义德企图用伊拉克军队镇压另外一个阿拉伯国家的人民运动，然而，结果不仅努里·赛义德本人，而且伊拉克以前的整个腐朽制度也都落得个十分悲惨的下场。只有那些对当前中近东现实局势丧失了清醒的判断能力、不愿看到时代的潮流的人，才会踏上军事冒险和公开反对民族解放运动的道路。
    仅仅在昨天，当伊拉克还在卖国的殖民主义者的代理人统治下的时候，巴格达集团的那些代表人物还在为伊拉克叫好。他们企图利用伊拉克作为钓饵，以便把其它阿拉伯国家也拖进这个集团。现在，当伊拉克人民自己掌握了自己的命运的时候。巴格达条约的成员国，其中包括那些参加这个条约的穆斯林国家的统治集团就开始剑拔弩张想要打击伊拉克共和国，而其原因只是由于伊拉克人民不愿再戴上殖民主义奴役的枷锁，而勇敢地走上巩固自己民族独立的道路。这样一来，西方国家很喜欢侈谈的什么自由和人权，什么尊重政治和宗教信仰这些假惺惺的话还值多少钱呢？
    毫无疑问，如果巴格达条约参加国所策划的对捍卫自己正义事业的、爱好自由的伊拉克人民的侵略一旦实现，那么其他爱好和平的各国人民将奋起援助被侵略的国家。
    现在大家都看得很清楚，目前，正当苏联和其他爱好和平的国家在尽一切努力，争取召开高级会议来采取紧急措施以便保证和平解决中近东地区的危机的时候，伦敦会议的参加者却在制订旨在使军事冲突进一步尖锐化的新的侵略措施。这样一来，美国和英国政府目前之所以采取拖延搪塞的策略，不顾世界各国人民的迫切要求而回避立即召开高级会议，其用意就更加清楚了。
    鉴于以上所述，不能不提醒巴格达条约参加国政府注意，要对侵略的进一步蔓延和由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任的，是美国和英国政府，同时也是那些追随帝国主义国家政策的巴格达条约参加国的统治集团。　（文内插题是本报编者加的）
