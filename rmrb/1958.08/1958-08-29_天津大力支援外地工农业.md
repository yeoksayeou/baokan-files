    Tianjin Vigorously Supports Industry and Agriculture in Other Areas
    (Our newspaper Tianjin, August 28th) The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently conducted a comprehensive inspection of the execution of contracts between factories in the city and other regions. The inspection results showed that the execution was good, with 81.7% of all collaborative contracts delivering goods on time and meeting the specifications and quality requirements stipulated in the contracts; 16% were delayed due to temporary increases in new tasks or untimely supply of raw materials; and only 2.3% did not execute the contracts.
    Since the beginning of this year, many factories in Tianjin have taken the initiative to support other regions in developing local industries and farmland water conservancy construction, and have signed a large number of supply contracts for machinery and industrial equipment with relevant departments in other regions. In addition to completing the state plan, the broad masses of workers have also demonstrated the spirit of communist collaboration, ensuring the quality and quantity of goods and fulfilling supply contracts on time or ahead of schedule. From January to July, the Tianjin Pipe Drawing Factory No. 2 not only fully completed ninety-three cooperation contracts signed with other regions, but also completed three hundred temporary cooperation contracts on schedule. The Tianjin Machinery Factory No. 2, which produces autoclaves, crushers, pharmaceutical machines and other products, has signed more than seventy supply contracts with Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia since the beginning of this year, all of which have been completed on schedule.
    Since the beginning of this year, after various regions vigorously developed local industries and vigorously built farmland water conservancy, they have sent people to Tianjin to request support in terms of machinery and equipment, industrial equipment, etc. As of now, it has received more than 10,000 person-times from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. Beyond the state plan, more than 10,000 various lathes, power equipment, power generation equipment, agricultural product processing machinery, etc. have been supported to various regions through contracts and agreements; more than 10,000 tons of coiled wire, malleable iron, steel wire, etc. Greater efforts are made to meet the needs of ethnic minorities in remote border areas for equipment and materials.
    Tianjin has also provided various aspects of technical assistance to various regions, supplying various technical data and drawings for manufacturing various machines and equipment, reaching more than 250,000 copies. It has also drawn more than 4,000 technical personnel from various factories to help various regions build local industries, and at the same time trained more than 12,000 technical workers of various types for various regions.

    天津大力支援外地工农业
    本报天津28日电　中共天津市委最近对全市工厂与外地协作的合同执行情况，进行了全面的检查。检查结果：执行情况良好，按期交货，产品规格质量合乎合同规定要求的占全部协作合同的81.7％；因临时增加新任务或原材料供应不及时而误期交货的占16％；没有执行合同的仅占2.3％。
    今年以来，天津市许多工厂主动支援外地大办地方工业和农田水利建设，纷纷和外地有关部门签订了大批机械设备和工业器材的供应合同。广大职工除了完成国家计划外，并发挥了共产主义协作精神，保质、保量，按期或提前执行了供货合同。天津拉管二厂1至7月份，除全面完成了与外地签订的九十三项协作合同外，还按期完成了三百项临时协作合同。生产高压釜、粉碎机、制药机等产品的天津机械二厂，今年以来和山东、河南、山西、江西、贵州、吉林、内蒙古签订了七十多份供应合同，已全部按期完成。
    今年以来各地大办地方工业和大力兴修农田水利后，纷纷派人来天津要求给予机械设备、工业器材等方面的支援，截至目前已接待了二十七个省市自治区前来的一万多人次。在国家计划以外通过合同、协议支援各地的各种车床、动力设备、发电设备、农产品加工机械等已有一万多部；盘条、玛钢、钢丝等一万多吨。对远在边疆地区少数民族要求支援的器材物资，更努力设法满足他们的需要。
    天津市还在技术上给各地多方面的帮助，供给各地的各种技术资料制造各种机器设备的图纸已达二十五万多份，还从各工厂中抽出四千多名技术人员，到各地帮助兴建地方工业，同时替各地培训了一万二千多名各工种的技术工人。（附图片）
