Xinhua News Agency report: Chongqing Coal Mining School is implementing the policy of combining work and study, adopting a two-shift teaching method to accelerate the training of technical cadres for the coal industry.

Starting in May of this year, the school adopted a two-shift system, keeping some students on campus for study while sending more than 700 students to Yutianpu to participate in general labor and mine labor.

The biggest advantage of implementing the two-shift teaching method is that it can fully utilize the school's teaching potential. It can double the number of students enrolled without substantially increasing teachers and equipment. The Chongqing Coal Mining School could originally accommodate a maximum of 2,000 students. After implementing the two-shift system, it can accommodate 3,200 to 4,000 students. At the same time, the two-shift system further implements the policy of combining education and labor, improving teaching standards. In previous years, students from this school interned in coal mines in Huainan, Anhui, Datong, Shanxi, Kailuan, Hebei, and Fengfeng, incurring internship expenses of about 30,000 yuan each year. After adopting the two-shift system this year, the school not only saved internship expenses, but also increased its income by 30,000 yuan through work-study programs in the past three months.

    重庆煤矿学校采取两班制办法
    加速培养煤矿技术干部
    据新华社讯  重庆煤矿学校贯彻勤工俭学方针，采取两班制教学方法，加速培养煤炭工业技术干部。
    这个学校从今年5月间开始采取两班制的办法，留一部分学生在校学习，抽出七百多名学生到鱼田堡参加普通劳动和矿井劳动。
    实行两班制教学方法的最大好处，是能充分发挥学校的教学潜力，能在基本上不增加师资和设备条件下，可以增收一倍的学生。重庆煤矿学校原来最多只能容纳二千名学生，实行两班制后，可以容纳三千二百名到四千名学生。同时两班制进一步贯彻了教育和劳动相结合的方针，提高了教学水平。往年这个学校的学生都是到安徽淮南、山西大同、河北开滦、峰峰等煤矿实习，每年仅实习费用就要花三万元左右，今年采取两班制后，学校不但节省了实习费用，三个月来，还在勤工俭学中增加了三万元的收入。
