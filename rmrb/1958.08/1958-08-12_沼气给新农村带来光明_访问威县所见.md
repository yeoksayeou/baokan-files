New Experiences in Farmers' Homes
On the night of July 22nd, we visited Wang Zhixiu, a woman from Xiwang Village, Wei County, Hebei, with excitement. At the foot of the west wall of her two north-facing rooms was a large oil drum storing methane. On one end of the drum was a self-made methane stove made of clay, and a gas hose connected the methane stove to the methane drum, with a water funnel for water pressure on the other side. Wang Zhixiu performed for us visitors several times, with good results. When boiling water, she placed the pot on the methane stove, and as soon as she turned the switch on the gas hose and lit the methane stove with a match, a red and blue flame of three or four inches high would appear. The family had used methane for cooking and boiling water more than ten times. Wang Zhixiu said that it could boil a pot of water in about twenty minutes and cook a meal in an hour or so, which was faster than the old stove. It also produced no smell or smoke, was not afraid of wind or rain, and kept the house and people clean. The methane stove was also more economical than the old stove. Wang Zhixiu calculated that saving about 10 cents a day on firewood for three meals would save about 3 yuan a month, or more than 30 yuan a year.

An Old Man's Conclusion
When we visited another family's methane lamp, the seventy-year-old man Zhai Qitai said to us with a smile, "Comrades, don't think it's too dazzling!" As he spoke, he added water to the water pressure funnel on the methane storage drum and turned on the switch of the methane lamp hanging in the middle of the room, whose shade was made of "cold cloth" smeared with toothpaste. With a hissing sound, the dazzling light illuminated the two rooms. People's eyes were almost squinted into slits by the sudden burst of light. An old lady who was doing needlework said that she used to use a kerosene lamp, but her eyesight was not good, and she rarely worked at night. Now she could pick up a dropped needle, and if she didn't have time during the day, she could work at night. Then Grandpa Zhai Qitai began to talk endlessly about how convenient, clean, and economical it was, getting more and more excited. He also led us to see the methane pit he planned to dig in the yard, and finally concluded, "Using methane means 'bright, economical, convenient, and clean.'"

Wang Shuxiu, a member of the Communist Youth League in Gangli Village, Xueta Township, Wei County, created a new method of extracting methane from the sludge of a water pit: inverting a basin in the water, drilling a small hole in the top of the basin, installing a valve to seal it, connecting it to a gas storage hose, and constantly stepping on the sludge with both feet. The methane in the sludge would rise with the white bubbles into the basin and be stored in the hose.

    沼气给新农村带来光明
    访问威县所见
    农家新事
    7月22日夜晚，我们怀着兴奋的心情访问河北威县西王村妇女王志修，在她家两间北房的西墙根，放着一个储存满沼气的大油桶，桶上端的一边放着个用胶泥自制的沼气炉，一条输气带把沼气炉和沼气桶连接了起来，另一边是起水压作用的水漏斗。王志修为我们这伙参观者作了好几次表演，效果很好。烧水时，把锅放在沼气炉上，只要把输气带上的开关一扭，再用火柴点燃沼气炉，即可发出红蓝色的三四寸高的火光。这个家庭已经使用沼气作饭、烧水十次之多。王志修说，它二十分钟左右可烧好一壶水，个把钟头作一顿饭，时间比旧灶快，又没味又没烟，不怕刮风更不怕雨天，屋里、个人都卫生。沼气炉又比旧灶节省。王志修这样算了一笔账：按一天三顿饭省一角左右的柴钱，一个月可节省三元左右，一年就是三十多元。
    老人的结论
    我们在另一个家庭里参观沼气灯的时候，七十多岁的老人翟其太满面带笑地对我们说：“同志，可不能嫌耀眼呀！”说着他把储存沼气桶上的水压漏斗上了水，又把挂在屋子当中纱罩是用“冷布”涂抹牙膏制成的沼气灯开关扭开，用火柴一点，在哧哧的声音里，耀眼的光亮照得两间屋通明。人们的眼睛猛地被这灯光一照，几乎都眯成一条线。手里正在作针线活的老太太说，过去点煤油灯，自己眼不行，轻易也不在夜里作活；这会掉个针也能拾得起来，有点活白天没空夜里就作了。接着翟其太老大爷滔滔不绝的也讲了起来，怎么个方便、干净，怎么个省钱，越说越带劲，又引导着我们去看他在院子里计划挖的沼气堆，最后才像总结似的说：“使用沼气就是明、省、便、净四个字。”

      威县雪塔乡刚里村共青团员王淑秀创造了从水坑的污泥中提取沼气的新办法：用一个盆子倒扣在水中，盆子顶部钻一小洞，安上气门封闭好，连接上储气带，用两脚不停地在污泥中踩蹬，污泥中的沼气即随着白泡升到盆子中储入带内。这是共青团员王淑秀（左）和雪塔村共青团支书项焕亭在水坑中提取沼气。　新华社记者　盛　果摄
