Later, it was revised while rehearsing, and it took only eighteen hours to complete the rehearsal, which is the Great Leap Forward of the Academy of Drama. The content of the play depicts the new face of Beijing five years from now.

    “北京的明天”
    中央戏剧学院表演系、导演系三年级的学生，这几天正在实验剧场上演“北京的明天”。李伯钊同志在大跃进中用了几个小时，就写成了这个戏的初稿。后来边排边改，到排练结束只用了十八个小时，这是戏剧学院的大跃进。戏的内容是描写五年后北京的新面貌。
