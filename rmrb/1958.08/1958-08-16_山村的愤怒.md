　　The Anger of the Mountain Village
　　Muye
　　On the afternoon of July 20th, the Wang Guofan Agricultural Cooperative in the mountainous area of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, held a mass meeting of the entire cooperative to protest against the U.S. armed aggression against Lebanon and to oppose the British dispatch of troops to Jordan.
　　Here, they had just fought fiercely against the mountain floods for five days and nights, just brought the floods under control; and, they had just revised the Great Leap Forward plan, increasing production eightfold compared to last year, and people were actively taking all measures to ensure the realization of this production increase target. However, after hearing the news of the U.S. and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East, the members temporarily put down their hoes and rushed to participate in the meeting.
　　After Party Secretary Li reported on the situation in the Middle East, shouts immediately rang out from the masses: "Celebrate the establishment of the Republic of Iraq!" "U.S. aggressors get out of Lebanon!" "British aggressors get out of Jordan!" Every voice was filled with anger, and every fist showed strength.
　　Although this is a place surrounded by mountains, and the farmers' past cultural level was very low – even now, not all cooperative members know exactly where Lebanon and Jordan are. However, the farmers here have long known to care about international affairs: they can recognize friends, and even more so, recognize enemies. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Party established strongholds here. The people fought against the Japanese devils; Wang Guofan and Du Kui captured armed enemies empty-handed. During the Liberation War, more than 46 people from this cooperative's more than 500 households joined the army. There were soldiers from this cooperative in the Korean War; in the Battle of Shangganling, which smashed the American devils, there were also farmers from here.
　　Therefore, the farmers here understand war and also understand peace; they oppose war, but they are never afraid of war.
　　The parade was like a giant dragon on the move. Passing through one mountain village, going around the foot of the mountain, and then to another mountain village. All along the way, slogans echoed across the mountains and fields, opposing the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism, to make it known to every household.
　　Between Forty Li Pu and Yu Jia Gou, there were still two streams of water that had not dried up. However, these two streams did not stop the advance of this parade. The head of the line reached the river and went down; then, whether male, female, old, or young, they all followed closely.
　　The parade traveled through all four villages. It stopped at a threshing ground. At this time, the sun was already approaching the western mountains. After Deputy Secretary Zhang made a summary, a production team leader stood up and said:
　　"We must step up production. I propose to engage in a night battle tonight!"
　　In an instant, a burst of warm applause rang out from the masses, responding to this powerful action to strike the enemy.

　　山村的愤怒
　　牧野
    7月20日的下午，河北遵化县山区王国藩农业社，召开一个全社群众大会，抗议美国武装侵略黎巴嫩、反对英国出兵约旦。
    这里，虽然刚刚和山洪苦战了五昼夜，刚刚把洪水驯服下来；并且，又刚刚修订了跃进规划，比去年产量提高八倍，人们正在积极进行一切措施，保证这个增产指标的实现。但是，听到美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的消息以后，社员们还是暂时放下锄头，赶来参加大会。
    党委李书记报告过中东的局势以后，群众里立刻响起来一阵阵的口号：“庆祝伊拉克共和国成立！”“美国侵略军从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“英国侵略军从约旦滚出去！”声声里都充满着愤怒，拳头上更显示着力量。
    虽说，这里是群山环抱的地方，农民们过去的文化都很低，——即使现在，黎巴嫩和约旦究竟在那里？社员们也并不是全体都知道。但是，这里的农民，对于国际间的事务早已知道关心：认得出朋友，更认得出敌人。在抗日开始的时候，党就在这里建立了据点。人民打过日本鬼子，王国藩和杜奎空手捉住过带枪的敌人。在解放战争时，这个社的五百多户人家中，曾有四十六人参军。抗美援朝志愿军里，有过这个社的战士；在打垮美国鬼子的上甘岭战役中，也有过这里的农民。
    所以，这里的农民，懂得战争，也懂得和平；反对战争，也决不害怕战争。
    游行队伍像条巨龙出动了。通过一个山村，绕着山脚再到另一个山村。一路上，漫山遍野响彻了口号，反对美英帝国主义的侵略，要让家喻户晓。
    从四十里铺到于家沟中间，还残留着两道没有流干的河水。然而，这两道河水，并没拦住这支游行队伍的前进。排头到了河跟前，走下去了；接着，不论是男的、女的、老的、少的，也都紧紧跟着走了下去。
    游行队伍把四个村庄都游遍了。在一个打麦场上停下来。这时候，太阳已经接近了西山。张副书记作了总结之后，一位生产队长站起来说：
    “我们一定要加紧生产。我提议今晚上搞夜战！”
    霎时间，群众里响起一阵热烈的掌声，来响应这个有力的打击敌人的行动。
