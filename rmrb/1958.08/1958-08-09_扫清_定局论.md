    Sweep Away "Theory of Fixed Outcome"

    In the management of autumn fields, Sichuan Province encountered obstacles from some adherents of the "theory of fixed outcome." They said that the summer had already brought a good harvest, and the autumn crops were growing well, so increased production this year was a "fixed outcome," and there was no need to work any harder. In the process of overcoming disasters and achieving a bumper early rice harvest in Mianyang County, Hubei, they also encountered adherents of the "theory of fixed outcome," who said that the disaster was a "fixed outcome" and could not be reversed, so there was no need to work any harder. These two kinds of "theory of fixed outcome," the former being blindly optimistic and the latter being passively pessimistic, may seem different on the surface, but their essence is the same—they both relax people's fighting spirit and negate people's dynamic role. Currently, the major autumn crops are in their peak growing season, and late autumn crops are still being sown, which is a time when much can be done to strive for even greater harvests; at the same time, during this period, natural disasters may strike suddenly at any time. If we believe in the "theory of fixed outcome," then this outcome is unlikely to be optimistic. Therefore, we must arm the people with the thought of continuous revolution and thoroughly sweep away all kinds of "theory of fixed outcome."

    扫清“定局论”
    四川省在秋田管理中遇到一些“定局论”者的阻难。他们说夏季已经丰收，秋禾长得很好，今年增产已成“定局”，不必再忙了。湖北沔阳县在战胜灾害取得早稻丰收的过程中，也遇到了“定局论”者，他们说灾害已成“定局”，无法挽回，不必忙了。这两种“定局论”，前者是盲目乐观，后者是消极悲观，表面看来好像有所不同，但其实质却相同——都是松懈了人们的斗志，否定了人的能动作用。目前大秋作物正值盛长期，晚秋还在播种，正是争取更大丰收大有可为的时候；同时，在这一段时间内，自然灾害随时都有突然降临的可能。如果相信“定局论”，那么这个结局是很难乐观的。因此，我们必须用不断革命的思想武装人民，彻底扫清各种“定局论”。
