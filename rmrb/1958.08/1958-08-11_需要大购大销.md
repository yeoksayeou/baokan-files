　　Need for Large-Scale Purchasing and Sales
    The great bumper harvests in agriculture and industry have presented many new demands to the commercial departments. They are required to do everything possible to engage in large-scale purchasing and sales, following the surging tide of the great leap forward in production.
    Some people are skeptical about large-scale purchasing and sales. They panic when they see a slight increase in inventory. The current increase in the inventory of some commodities is indeed more than in previous years, but it is not much compared to the needs of the people's lives. Of course, more inventory will bring some trouble in storage and safekeeping. However, this trouble can be completely solved through the mass line method.
    Large-scale purchasing and sales are two aspects of one problem. Large-scale purchasing without large-scale sales will inevitably lead to backlog, and large-scale sales without large-scale purchasing will inevitably lead to supply falling short of demand. Only large-scale purchasing and sales can accelerate the circulation of commodities and promote the development of production.
    Recently, commercial departments in various regions have taken some specific measures to actively prepare for large-scale purchasing and sales. We believe that with the development of large-scale purchasing and sales, a newer atmosphere will appear in the market.

　　需要大购大销
    农业的大丰收和工业的大丰收，都给商业部门提出了许多新的要求。要求商业部门想尽一切办法大购大销，紧跟着生产大跃进的浪涛奔腾向前。
    有些人对于大购大销采取怀疑态度，他们看到库存稍许多了一些就惊慌失措。目前库存增加的一些商品，同往年比起来确实是多了一些，但是同人民生活需要比起来并不算多。当然库存多了会给储存、保管上带来一些麻烦。不过，这种麻烦通过群众路线的方法也是完全可以解决的。
    大购大销是一个问题的两个方面，大购而不大销，势必造成积压，大销而不大购，必然要发生供不应求。只有大购大销才能加速商品的流转，促进生产的发展。
    近来，各地商业部门采取了一些具体办法，积极准备大购大销。我们相信随着大购大销的业务开展，市场上将出现更新的气氛。
