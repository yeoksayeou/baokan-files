　　Inspiration from Hygiene Work
　　Wu De
    These past two days, I accompanied the hygiene inspection team to observe the hygiene situation in several suburban townships of a certain city. Except for one village in one township where hygiene work was found to be poorly done, the hygiene work in all other townships was very good. This shows that the mass hygiene movement has indeed produced a tremendous effect. I will not discuss the general achievements here. I will only talk about a bit of personal inspiration I received from the contrast between two different typical examples.

    In a township where hygiene work was done very well, the four pests were gone, and there wasn't a single maggot in the toilets. Every corner was swept clean. The people here are all very healthy. As soon as the inspection team arrived, men, women, old and young all came out to welcome us, each standing tall and full of energy. A group of interesting children sang to each other:
  “I love you, no snot…”. More than fifty elderly women, self-proclaimed "small feet heroines," also beat gongs, danced the Yangko, and sang "Socialism is good...". The healthy, joyful people and the bright, fresh environment made one feel clear-eyed and refreshed. Talking with them, I learned that this township not only does a good job in hygiene but also in other work, such as agricultural production, running industries, eliminating illiteracy, and reforming farm tools. This township's overall leap forward is naturally due to the full mobilization of the masses, but the comprehensive perspective of the township's leaders, who can make overall plans and unified arrangements for everything, also plays a significant role. For example, they regard production as the center but do not neglect hygiene work, believing that good hygiene can also promote production. Indeed, with men, women, old and young all full of energy, how could production not be good?

    The situation was different in the township where hygiene work was not well done. The leading comrades here were very focused on production, of course, also wanting to strive for the top; but they put production and hygiene work in opposition to each other, always fearing that doing hygiene would affect production. At first, hygiene work was also done for a while, but there was no determination to do it thoroughly, and afterwards, hygiene work was completely abandoned. When we went to inspect, there were still many flies there, and the stinking ditches along the village roads were not filled in. The spirit of the masses was not as strong as in the previous township. The production in this township was also not as good as in the previous township. For example, in one production team in this township, out of more than a hundred male laborers, twenty-eight people contracted dysentery due to unclean food and drink, which affected attendance, and production naturally lagged behind. The people of the inspection team introduced the situation of the advanced township to the leaders of this township. They also admitted that their views were wrong and assured the inspection team that they would seriously do hygiene work for three days without affecting production and welcomed the inspection team to inspect again.

    I think that bad things can turn into good things, and this is a clear example. Poor hygiene work, people getting sick, and affecting production are all bad things, of course, but because they have received lessons from the facts, both the leaders and the masses have deep feelings, and the transformation must also be more thorough. In the future, hygiene will be easier to do well and maintain. However, I think the benefits are not limited to these. The inspiration it gives people in their thinking is much greater than the promotion of hygiene work.

    It makes us see once again that many things have mutual connections and constraints. Recognizing these connections and constraints, in dealing with them, while grasping the center, we can also make overall plans and unified arrangements, and the result is mutual promotion and comprehensive leap forward. If we do not recognize this relationship but isolate many things and put them in opposition to each other when dealing with them, only doing one thing at a time, with one thing or the other, only grasping the center and abandoning other things, then other things will pull the center's legs, and they will entangle and hinder each other, and neither can move forward. The leading comrades in the latter township also wanted to do a good job in production, but they did not admit that hygiene was related to production. As a result, hygiene dragged down production, which made them comprehensively backward. Production and hygiene are like this, and isn't everything else like this as well?

    The former view is dialectical materialism; the latter view is mechanical materialism. This also shows that philosophy is inseparable from all practical life, and there is a philosophical opposition in all areas of life, which is worthy of our serious study in conjunction with practice.

### 卫生工作的启发

　　卫生工作的启发
　　武德
    这两天，随卫生检查团看了某市郊区几个乡的卫生情况。除了在一个乡的一个村庄发现卫生工作搞的不好以外，其他各个乡的卫生工作都很好，这说明群众性的卫生运动，的确已经产生了巨大作用。这里且不谈这一般的成绩，我只谈谈从两个不同的典型对比中，谈一谈我个人受到的一点启发。
    在一个卫生工作搞得很好的乡里，四害不见了，厕所里连一个蛆也没有。每个角落都扫得一干二净。这里的人们，身体都很健康。检查团一到，男女老少都出来欢迎，个个腰板挺直，精神焕发。一群有趣的孩子彼此唱着：
  “我爱你，没鼻涕……”。有五十多位老大娘，自封为小脚英雄队，也敲起锣鼓，扭起秧歌，唱着“社会主义好，……”。健康欢乐的人群和明净新鲜的事物，令人顿觉眼目清亮，神清气爽。同他们谈起话来，才知道这个乡不仅卫生搞得好，其他工作，如农业生产、办工业、扫盲、农具改革等也都搞得很好。这个乡全面跃进，首先自然是由于群众发动的充分，但是这个乡的领导者看问题全面，样样事情都能全面规划统一安排，也有很大关系。比如他们把生产看作中心，但并不忽视卫生工作，认为卫生搞得好也能促进生产。事实也是这样，男女老少个个都欢龙活虎也似的，生产又怎能搞不好呢？
    那个卫生工作不好的乡里，情况就不同。这里的领导同志，对生产抓的很紧，这当然也是想力争上游；但他们却把生产和卫生工作对立起来，老是怕搞卫生影响了生产，开初，卫生工作也曾搞了一下，但并没有下决心彻底搞，过后更是完全丢掉了卫生工作。我们去看的时候，那里的苍蝇还不少，村边路上的臭水沟也没有填平，群众的精神也没有前面那个乡那样健旺。这个乡的生产，也不如前面那个乡搞的好，例如，这个乡有一个生产队，一百多男劳动力中，因为饮食不洁净，有二十八个人得了痢疾，影响了出勤，生产自然也就落后了。检查团的人，向这个乡的领导人介绍了那个先进乡的情况，他们也承认自己的看法不对，向检查团保证，在不影响生产的情况下，三天中把卫生工作认真搞一下，欢迎检查团再来检查。
    我想，坏事能变好事，这也就是一个鲜明的例子。卫生工作搞的不好，人害了病，影响了生产，这当然都是坏事，但由于受到了事实的教训，领导者和群众都有了深刻的感受，转变一定也比较彻底，今后的卫生，反倒会更容易搞好和坚持下去。不过我以为，好处还不只这些，它给人们思想上的启发，要远比对卫生工作的推动大得多。
    它使我们再一次明白地看到，许多事物之间是有相互联系和制约关系的。认识到这种联系和制约关系，在处理它们的时候，既抓住中心，又能作全面规划，统一安排，结果就是彼此促进，全面跃进。如果不认识这种关系，而是把许多事物都孤立起来看，处理它们的时候，把它们互相对立起来又只是单打一，有此无彼，或有彼无此，只抓了中心而抛掉其它，结果其它便来拉这中心的腿，彼此纠缠阻碍，都不能前进了。后边这个乡的领导同志，何尝不是想搞好生产，但他们却不承认卫生是同生产有联系的，结果是卫生拉了生产的后腿，反倒使他们全面落后了。生产和卫生是这样，其他一切工作又何尝不是这样呢？
    前者的看法是辩证唯物的；后者的看法是机械唯物论。这又可见哲学这东西实在是同一切实际生活离不开，而在一切生活领域里都有着哲学思想的对立，这是很值得我们去认真结合实践加以学习的。
