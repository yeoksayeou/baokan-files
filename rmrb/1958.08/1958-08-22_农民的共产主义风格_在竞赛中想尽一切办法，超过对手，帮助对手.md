　　Farmers' Communist Style
    Trying Every Possible Way to Surpass and Help Opponents in Competition

    (Our newspaper dispatch) This reporter Yang Weiqun reports: In the high-yield late rice production competition unfolding in the areas of Panyu County and Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, which are adjacent to each other, a communist model of both competition and cooperation has been established. This is manifested in the selfless assistance that Yuwotou and Lingshan townships in Panyu County gave to their competition opponents, Huangge and Dagang townships in Zhongshan County, when they were facing difficulties in transplanting rice seedlings.

    Yuwotou and Lingshan townships in Panyu County are competing with Huangge and Dagang townships in Zhongshan County, respectively. The fields of both sides are adjacent to each other, and their strength is evenly matched. They posted challenge letters at the entrances of each other's township committees and in the marketplaces. The archways erected at major intersections and the banners hung on bridges were all inscribed with challenging slogans in a tit-for-tat manner. When working in the fields with interplanted crops, they competed face-to-face with even more vigor. In addition, they often inquired about each other's measures in order to adopt countermeasures at any time. Both sides tried every possible way to surpass their opponents in order to achieve victory in the competition. However, when Yuwotou and Lingshan townships learned that their competitors, Huangge and Dagang townships, were facing difficulties in plowing and harrowing many fields due to insufficient manpower and oxen power, and that the transplanting work was in danger of missing the season, they immediately freed up their strength to provide assistance. On the 8th of this month, each of the two townships dispatched more than 30 of their strongest laborers—members of the "satellite teams" in the agricultural cooperatives—each equipped with an ox and a complete set of plows and harrows, to form a support team and go to the other's fields. After that, Yuwotou township also allocated 15 seeders and a tractor to support its opponent, Huangge township.

    The support teams sent by Yuwotou and Lingshan townships were assigned to Lianfeng cooperative in Huangge township and Donglong cooperative in Dagang township, respectively. Everyone was full of enthusiasm, treating the supported cooperative as their own, working day and night alongside the local cooperative members, and actively discussing with the cooperative cadres and production team leaders to adopt various methods to improve work efficiency and quality. The Yuwotou township support team stationed in Lianfeng cooperative, in addition to being responsible for plowing and harrowing the fields, also participated in rushing to transplant rice seedlings and direct seeding. Seeing that the previously harrowed soil was not rotten enough, the fingers were easily damaged during transplanting, the progress was slow, and the quality was poor, they suggested that the fields be harrowed again. Seeing that large areas of fields had no spacing, irrigation was difficult to control, and the previously sown seeds did not emerge evenly, they suggested adding small field ridges and replanting seedlings. Seeing that hand sowing for direct seeding was very slow, so that direct seeding and transplanting could not quickly keep pace, they sent people back to their own cooperative to move the seeders to support. Later, seeing that the progress of plowing and harrowing the fields was still not keeping up with the urgent season, they sent people back to their hometown to ask for a tractor to be borrowed. Thus, on the 14th, Dongyong cooperative in Yuwotou township allocated a tractor that had just been purchased after the summer harvest and a newly trained tractor driver.

    Huangge and Dagang townships in Zhongshan County were greatly moved and inspired by the selfless assistance of their competition opponents. Township and cooperative cadres and the masses were all working their hardest to catch up, competing with their opponents, and preparing to welcome the upcoming on-site appraisal.

    Yuwotou and Lingshan townships in Panyu County and Huangge and Dagang townships in Zhongshan County are all located in the sandy farmland area, with a large land area and a small population, and the conditions are generally the same. In this late rice planting, the progress of Yuwotou and Lingshan townships was originally also very slow. It was only because Panyu County implemented large-scale cooperation between townships and received support from some townships within the county that the situation improved. This communist style infected the cadres and the masses of these two townships. Therefore, when they discovered that their competition opponents, Huangge and Dagang townships in Zhongshan County, were in difficulty, even though some of the fields in their own townships and cooperatives had not yet been transplanted, they also dispatched some of their strength to support them.

　　农民的共产主义风格
    在竞赛中想尽一切办法，超过对手，帮助对手
    本报讯  记者杨伟群报道：广东省番禺县与中山县毗邻的地区在展开晚造高额丰产竞赛中，树立了又竞赛又协作的共产主义范例。这表现在正当中山县黄阁、大岗两个乡插秧工作面临困难的时候，番禺县鱼窝头乡、灵山乡却给他们的竞赛对手以无私的援助。
    番禺县鱼窝头乡、灵山乡分别与中山县黄阁乡、大岗乡进行竞赛，双方田地毗连，旗鼓相对。他们互相把战书贴到对方的乡委会门口和市集街上，大路口扎的牌楼、桥头上挂的横额都针锋相对地写着挑战的标语，在插花地的田间进行劳动时更是面对面地比干劲；此外，还经常互相打听对方的措施，以便随时采取对策。双方都为了取得竞赛的胜利，想尽一切办法要超过对手。但是，当鱼窝头乡、灵山乡了解到竞赛对手黄阁乡、大岗乡因人力和牛力不足，很多田地未犁耙，插秧工作有错过季节危险的时候，却马上腾出力量来支援。本月8日，这两个乡各抽调了三十多个最强的劳动力——农业社里的“卫星队”员，每人配给一头耕牛和全套犁耙，组成支援的队伍，开到对方田里去。此后，鱼窝头乡还调拨了播种器十五部和拖拉机一部去支援对手黄阁乡。
    鱼窝头乡、灵山乡派出的支援队，分别被分配在黄阁乡连风社、大岗乡东隆社。他们个个满腔热情，把受支援的社当作自己的社，和当地的社员一起夜以继日地苦战，并且主动与社干部及生产队长研究采取种种办法来提高工作效率和工作质量。驻在连风社的鱼窝头乡支援队，除了负责犁耙田地之外，还参加抢插秧苗和直播。他们见到原先耙过的田土不够烂，插秧时手指易受损，进度慢，质量又差，便建议把田再耙一次。他们见到大幅田地没有间隔，灌溉不便控制，使原先播下的谷种出苗不齐，便建议加筑小田埂和补苗。他们见到用手撒种搞直播很慢，以致直播与插秧不能快速地齐头并进，便派人回到自己的社里把播种器搬来支援。后来，他们见到犁耙田地的进度还是赶不上紧迫的季节，便又派人回乡去请借拖拉机。于是，就在14日，鱼窝头乡东涌社把在夏收后刚购置的一架拖拉机和刚训练好的拖拉机手调拨了过去。
    中山县黄阁乡、大岗乡受到竞赛对手的无私援助，乡、社干部和群众大大的感动和振奋起来，他们都在用最大的努力把工作赶上去，与他们的对手争上游，准备迎接快要到来的现场大评比。
    番禺县鱼窝头乡、灵山乡与中山县黄阁乡、大岗乡都是沙田地区，地多人少，条件大体上相同。这次晚稻播插，鱼窝头、灵山两个乡原先进度也很慢，只是由于番禺县乡与乡之间实行大协作，得到了县内一些乡的支援，情况才有了好转。这种共产主义风格感染了这两个乡的干部和群众，因此，当发现竞赛对手中山县黄阁乡、大岗乡有困难时，虽然本乡本社有一部分田仍未插秧，也就抽调出部分力量来支援他们。
