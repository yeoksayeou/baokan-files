　　Use this year's bumper harvest experience to promote next year's Great Leap Forward.
    Shangjiluo Township discusses the actual and the abstract to lay a solid ideological foundation for high-speed production increase.
　　The Communist Party of China, Hongzhao County Committee, Shanxi Province

    This year, Shangjiluo Township in Hongzhao County has an average wheat yield of 550 jin per mu, an increase of 37% compared to the average of 1957, which can be considered a leap forward. However, can we continue to advance at an even faster pace in the future? For example, in 1957, the Xiong Huo Cooperative had an average yield of 460 jin per mu, with a record high of 800 jin per mu; in 1958, all its land (802 mu) achieved a yield of 802 jin per mu, and there were also high-yield records of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu on 12.52 mu. So, can we popularize the high-yield record of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu to the average level of the entire cooperative next year, and create new high-yield records of 5,000 jin or 10,000 jin? This is a question that every commune member should immediately resolve in their minds. Therefore, under the direct leadership of the county committee, the township organized a wheat production leap forward debate, attended by township, cooperative, and team cadres, local wheat experts, activist commune members, and Professor Xie Mengming of Shanxi Agricultural College. The meeting implemented the principle of "discussing the abstract based on the actual," with each person discussing the actual experience of wheat bumper harvests and talking freely about materialist dialectics. In an atmosphere full of daring thoughts, bold speech, and free expression, the truth and falsehood of various viewpoints were clarified, laying an ideological foundation for rapid leap forward.
    Lofty Discussions on the Prospects of Wheat Bumper Harvests
    How much wheat can actually be produced per mu? This is the question that people are most interested in. Following scientific principles and also having a spirit of boundless imagination, everyone engaged in lofty discussions on the prospects of wheat bumper harvests, not only discussing the past and present but also making comparisons from China to foreign countries. Everyone who participated in the debate felt proud of the records they and various fraternal agricultural cooperatives had created of 3,000 jin, 4,000 jin, 5,000 jin, and 7,000 jin per unit area. Therefore, the interest in discussing a new era of wheat bumper harvests grew stronger. Based on years of production experience, especially the experience of producing 3,153.4 jin per mu on 1.2 mu this year, the Xiong Huo Cooperative believes that it is entirely possible to have eight stalks of wheat per square inch of land, with a spacing of 1.25 fen between stalks, and an average of 100 grains per stalk. This requires deep plowing of more than 1.5 chi, planting more than 100 jin of seeds per mu, controlling the tillering of each seed to two to three stalks, and having 4.8 million stalks per mu, which can produce 36,000 jin. This plan is not a distant fantasy but a high-yield target for each production team in 1959. So, is 36,000 jin the limit? No, Zhang Qingshun of the tenth production team of the Xiong Huo Cooperative said: We can improve the habits of wheat, such as grafting it with millet, so that each wheat ear is eight inches to one chi long, with 500 grains per ear. If there are 2.5 million stalks per mu, it can still produce 89,000 jin. Furthermore, if we improve the wheat to have multiple ears per stalk or grains as large as pomegranate seeds, the yield would be immeasurable. Although this kind of idea is not yet a reality, the peasants, filled with the revolutionary spirit of romanticism, with this boundless imagination and soaring enthusiasm, can turn these ideals into reality.
    Due to the overall bumper harvest of wheat and the large number of high-yield records, as well as the promotion of the national production development situation, commune members have proposed bumper harvest targets of an average yield of 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu, and experimental fields with yields of 5,000 jin, 10,000 jin, and 30,000 jin per mu. These targets are promoting people to use their brains, seriously summarize advanced production increase experiences from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and thus propose a new set of production measures and production methods, and establish a new set of production regulations.
    The Central Point of Wheat Production Leap Forward
    To establish a new specification for wheat bumper harvests, we must first study the commonalities of bumper harvests of various crops and find out the basic factors of crop bumper harvests. The discussion unanimously agreed that: realizing water conservancy and providing water in a timely manner; applying sufficient fertilizer to ensure adequate nutrition for crops; deep plowing and improving the soil to give crops strong roots; selecting superior varieties and eliminating inferior ones; implementing dense planting to increase the number of ears; and doing a good job in field management, removing insects and weeds in a timely manner, are the six basic conditions to ensure bumper harvests. However, from the wheat growth practice over the years, everyone has found a special rule, that is: it is difficult to break through 1,000 jin per mu in fields that do not break through 500,000 stalks; it is difficult to break through 3,000 jin per mu in fields that do not break through 1 million stalks. The problem lies precisely here. In Shangjiluo Township, fields reaching 500,000 stalks account for less than half of all wheat fields, fields reaching 1 million stalks account for less than 10% of all wheat fields, and fields with less than 200,000 stalks still account for a considerable number. This is an important reason for the imbalance of the highest single yield of 3,000 jin and the lowest single yield of less than 100 jin. Therefore, the above six measures should be led by dense planting, and a series of technological innovations centered on the highest degree of dense planting should be implemented. Only by riding the leap forward horse of dense planting and breaking through the barrier of one million stalks can the enthusiasm of commune members for increasing production be aroused and force other measures to be raised to a higher limit. Not daring to ride the horse of dense planting will also prevent other bumper harvest measures from leaping forward at full speed. Therefore, we must not only understand that the six measures of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, and management are interconnected, mutually influential, and indispensable, but also affirm that dense planting is the central point to ensure the leap forward of wheat production.
    The Dialectics of Dense Planting and Increased Production
    To establish new production regulations centered on dense planting will inevitably cause a struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the conservative. The conservatives, represented by the former party branch secretary and cooperative director of Xinbao Village, opposed dense planting, believing that "dense planting is a handful of grass" and that dense planting has "two bad things," namely: small ears with few grains and thin stalks that are easy to lodge. Li Yubei, a member of the management committee of Yuhui Cooperative, also seized on the shortcomings of some wheat lodging in Xiong Huo Cooperative to satirize, saying: We suggest that the county committee seriously promote our experience of sparse planting. And he cited examples of some cooperatives reducing production after dense planting in 1956 to oppose the implementation of a high degree of dense planting.
    Does dense planting really have two bad things? Let's prove it with facts. The 1.2 mu experimental field of the third production team of the Xiong Huo Cooperative planted 25 jin of seeds per mu, had more than 1 million stalks, with 80 to 100 grains per ear, and the least being 40 grains, with a yield of 3,135.4 jin. All 802 mu of wheat in the cooperative were sown with dense planting drills, generally reaching 500,000 stalks, with an average yield of 802 jin per mu and a minimum yield of 400 jin per mu. Xinbao Agricultural Cooperative planted 750 mu of wheat with old drills with a 7-inch row spacing. There were 350 mu with more than 200,000 stalks, 400 mu with less than 200,000 stalks, and 60 mu with 130,000 stalks. The number of grains per ear reached 50 for the most, and generally only 20. The average yield per mu of the whole cooperative was 380 jin, of which more than 100 mu yielded less than 100 jin per mu.
  “The yields are different three li apart, one yields more than 800 mu, and the other only yields 330”. Can it be said that Xinbao Agricultural Cooperative’s yield was lower than Xiong Huo Cooperative’s because of excessive dense planting? No, Xinbao Agricultural Cooperative simply did not dare to ride the horse of dense planting, and they were afraid that “excessive tension” would be caused after dense planting. Precisely because of not being tense, other measures did not catch up. For example, the seventh production team had a total of 120 mu of wheat fields, with a plowing depth of no more than five inches, 40 mu with no fertilizer applied, and even the good land near the village was fertilized with no more than 10,000 jin. The Xiong Huo Cooperative not only deep-plowed eight inches to one chi, applied more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, but also organized a wheat bumper harvest research group and a bad land bumper harvest management group to carefully strengthen field management. This is the real reason for the disparity in yield under the same conditions.
    Is it destined to lodge after dense planting? Believing that dense planting is prone to lodging is also a metaphysical view. Because the implementation of dense planting is to more rationally utilize land and sunlight, and scientific dense planting can also prevent lodging. Therefore, there are also two different routes for preventing lodging in the debate. One is passively afraid of lodging and dare not densely plant or water less; the other is actively strengthening a series of production increase measures. Because the problem of lodging must be found from various production factors, Xiong Huo Cooperative's inspection of the causes of wheat lodging is: insufficient deep plowing, little base fertilizer, too much nitrogen fertilizer applied in spring, and unreasonable irrigation, so the wheat root system is not strong enough, and there is too much tillering in spring, and the wheat stem tissue is loose. Next year, we must achieve deep plowing of one chi five, rational fertilizer application, sufficient base fertilizer (50,000 to 100,000 jin per mu), sufficient winter fertilizer, so that the wheat seedlings complete tillering once in winter, strictly control spring tillering, and implement small furrow shallow watering, etc. In this way, the problem of lodging can be prevented.
    "Dense planting marshal wants to ascend the account, must rely on the ‘pioneers’," explaining the dialectical view between the various bumper harvest measures centered on dense planting. Some people have proposed "rational dense planting," and there are also two views on this. One is to make the standard of dense planting conform to the implementation level of other production measures before the Great Leap Forward in production, which is the understanding of the conservatives. One is to drive a series of major agricultural technology revolutions with the level of highly dense planting, which is the understanding of the revolutionaries. In Shangjiluo Township's debate on dense planting, the revolutionaries defeated the conservatives, and unanimously agreed that: "Riding on the dense planting leap forward horse, breaking through the one million stalks barrier, the six measures leaping forward together, not obtaining a high yield is not allowed by heaven."
    Facts Reveal the Truth, Greatly Destroying Mechanism
    Is it possible to establish a new production regulation centered on dense planting and maintain the high speed of wheat production forever? The vast majority of people answered in the affirmative. However, there are also skeptics. Although these skeptics are small in number, they are full of conditionalism, the law of diminishing speed, the law of average speed, accidentalism, and pessimism. All of these arguments are mechanistic. When this view envelops people, they are always cautious and dare not believe in their own strength. Therefore, the debate "discusses the abstract based on the actual" and greatly destroys mechanistic theory.
    There are two kinds of conditionalism, one believes that people with good conditions can leap forward, and we with bad conditions can only advance slowly; the other believes that cooperatives with low production levels can leap forward, cooperatives with high production levels have exhausted their potential and reached the top, and can only advance slowly and cannot leap forward.
    Facts reveal the truth, and the production increase speed of the Xiong Huo Cooperative can completely refute the above two arguments. This cooperative's average wheat yield per mu in 1957 was 460 jin, which was the cooperative with the highest production level in the county. This year, it still increased production by 75%. Next year, it will double the unit yield again on the basis of 800 jin per mu. The tenth production team of the cooperative has 20 mu of seventh-class land, which only produced 60 jin of wheat per mu last year. In order to completely eliminate fields with less than 100 jin, the commune members put forward the slogan "Let seventh-class land and first-class land serve the people equally" and adopted a series of measures. As a result, the average yield per mu was more than 600 jin. Among them, 2.3 mu of land that had not been able to catch seedlings in previous years reached a yield of 2,391.5 jin per mu. This leap forward speed of forty times fully shows that "it depends on human effort, and the land depends on human cultivation," "there are only bad crops, no bad conditions." Any condition can not only leap forward but also fly forward. We advocate the dialectical materialist conditionalism, and the optimistic conditionalism: bad conditions mean great potential, and there can be a 40-fold or higher increase in production speed; good conditions mean a good foundation, and it is easier to exert the potential for increasing production, and can also create several times to dozens of times the increase in production speed.
    The main reason for accidentalism is "planning is in the hands of man, success is in the hands of heaven," "it is easy to make an individual success, but difficult to popularize." This is a manifestation of not seeing the new situation of the rapid leap forward in national industry, agriculture, and science and culture. Like the law of average speed, it is not believing in the power of the people. Although they are full of laws, they are only listing some superficial phenomena and piecing together a few percentages of agricultural production increase speed in the period of individual economy, and think that they have found the law of production development. This view only shows the rigidity of thought, and its mistake lies in looking at problems statically. Pessimism is even a cowardly and inferior manifestation. What is the accumulation of fertilizer without a source of fertilizer, although deep plowing is good, the livestock is too weak, and people can be exhausted to death, etc., there are always many difficulties, and they cannot raise their heads.
    A fierce debate made people clear that: mechanists are always slaves of nature, and we must be the rulers and masters of nature. The fact is that nature is especially against cowards and lazy people, the more you are afraid of it, the more stingy it is, the more you dare to oppress it, the more it will serve you with a hundredfold reward. Therefore, from the point of view of dialectical materialism, the potential for agricultural production increase is endless, and human initiative is the key to developing the potential for production increase. The fundamental error of mechanists lies in ignoring the subjective initiative of people, and ignoring the magnificent ability of liberated peasants to transform nature.
    Establish a Communist Style
    The struggle against various mechanistic theories in agricultural production boils down to the dispute over the speed of production development. And this dispute over speed still embodies the struggle between the capitalist and socialist roads. Xinbao Agricultural Cooperative is because the capitalist management thought has prevailed among the leading cadres in the cooperative, so they do not seriously tap the potential for production increase and strive for high-speed progress in agricultural production, but do not obey the state's planned management, and manage whatever crops sell more, privately open workshops, evade taxes and smuggle, and conceal output. They once boasted that: our cooperative has the lowest output, and our cooperative has the highest reward value for workdays! Therefore, the people who participated in the debate unanimously agreed that: all issues must be "commanded" by socialist thought, sweeping away the remnants of capitalist thought. Xinbao Agricultural Cooperative and Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative have the same population, land area, and production conditions, but their output and the amount of grain sold to the state are twice as different. In 1957, Xiong Huo Cooperative actually sold 247,000 jin of public grain and surplus grain, while Xinbao Cooperative only sold 122,000 jin. Fully demonstrating two different kinds of enthusiasm and style. Therefore, the cadres present not only proposed to pull out the white flag and insert the red flag, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced; but also to compete in increasing production, competing in enthusiasm, and competing in contribution, and establishing a noble communist ideological style.
    New Methods for Summarizing Bumper Harvest Experience
    Shangjiluo Township boldly used the method of "discussing the abstract based on the actual" to summarize the wheat bumper harvest experience, thereby raising the actual experience in the production struggle to the height of theory, laying an ideological foundation for striving for a leap forward in wheat production next year. This new method of summarizing bumper harvest experience has given us the following lessons:
    (1) Using the method of combining theory and practice, the dross in the specific production experience was eliminated, and its essence was extracted, so that the wheat bumper harvest experience initially reached systematization, laying the foundation for establishing a new specification for agricultural production technology.
    (2) Precisely because the method of combining "comparing and calculating" and "talking and discussing" was adopted, it avoided simply listing technical problems and combined the improvement of technology with the liberation of thought. Therefore, this is an important method for agricultural cooperative red and expert schools to train both red and expert talents from the working masses.
    (3) This debate proves that philosophy is not mysterious, and dialectical materialism is not unfathomable. Peasants can learn philosophy and can talk freely about dialectical materialism. Moreover, they are the creators of actual production experience, and therefore it is easier to grasp the theory than some intellectuals who are divorced from reality.

　　用今年丰产经验推动明年大跃进
    上纪落乡就实论虚，打好高速度增产的思想基础
　　中共山西洪赵县委会
    洪赵县上纪落乡今年平均亩产小麦五百五十斤，比1957年每亩平均增产37％，可以算一个跃进。但是，今后能不能以更高的速度继续前进呢？再如雄火社1957年全社每亩平均产量四百六十斤，高额丰产纪录八百斤；1958年则全部土地（八百零二亩）亩产达到八百零二斤，又出现了十二点五二亩两千到三千余斤的高额丰产纪录。那么，明年是否能把两千到三千斤的高额纪录再普及为全社的平均水平，并且出现五千斤、一万斤的新的高额纪录呢？这是每一个社员思想上应该立即解决的问题。因此，这个乡在县委直接领导下，组织乡、社、队干部、小麦土专家、社员积极分子和山西农学院教授谢孟明参加的小麦生产跃进辩论会，会议贯彻了“就实论虚”的方针，每一个人都就小麦丰产的实际经验，纵谈唯物辩证法。在充满敢想、敢说、畅所欲言的气氛中，辩清了各种观点的真伪，奠定了快速度跃进的思想基础。
    高谈阔论小麦丰产前景
    一亩地究竟可以产到多少小麦？这是人们最有兴趣的问题。按照既有科学道理，又要有海阔天空的精神，大家对于小麦丰产前景展开了高谈阔论，不但谈古论今，而且从中国到外国进行了对比。每一个参加辩论的人都对自己和各个兄弟农业社创造的单位产量三千斤、四千斤、五千斤、七千斤的纪录，感到骄傲。所以纵谈小麦丰产新纪元的兴趣越来越浓。雄火社根据历年生产经验，特别是今年一亩二分地亩产三千一百五十三斤四两的经验认为：每一平方寸土地长八个株穗，株距一分二厘五，每株平均达到一百个麦粒是完全可能的。这就需要深耕一尺五寸以上，每亩下种一百余斤，每粒籽种控制分蘖二到三株，每亩四百八十万株穗，可产三万六千斤。这一方案并不是遥遥无期的空想，而是1959年各个生产队的高额丰产目标。那么，三万六千斤是不是到了顶呢？不，雄火社第十生产队张青顺说：我们可以改良小麦的习性，比如使它和谷子嫁接，让每个麦穗有八寸到一尺长，每穗结籽五百粒，每亩如果是二百五十万株，还可以产到八万九千斤，再如果把小麦改良成一株多穗，或麦粒像石榴籽那样的大，产量就无法计量。这种设想虽然在目前还不是现实，但是充满了革命的浪漫主义精神的农民，有了这种海阔天空的想像，再加上冲天的干劲，这些理想是可以变成现实的。
    由于小麦全面丰收和高额丰产纪录的大量出现，以及全国生产发展形势的促进，社员们已经提出了平均亩产二千斤、三千斤，试验田亩产五千斤、一万斤、三万斤的丰产指标。这些指标促进着人们开动脑筋，认真总结古今中外的先进增产经验，从而提出一套新的生产措施和生产方法，建立一套新的生产规程。
    小麦生产跃进的中心点
    要想建立一套小麦丰产的新规格，就必须首先研究各种农作物丰产的共性，找出农作物丰产的各项基本因素。讨论中一致认为：实现水利化，及时供水；饱施肥料，使作物有充足的营养；深耕和改良土壤，使作物有健壮的根须；选用优种剔除杂劣；实行密植、增加穗数；搞好田间管理，及时除虫锄草等，是保证丰产的六项基本条件。但是，从历年的小麦生长实践中，大家又找到一项特殊规律，即：凡突不破五十万株穗的田，每亩产量就很难突破一千斤；凡突不破百万株穗的田，每亩产量就很难突破三千斤。问题恰恰在这里。上纪落乡达到五十万株的田，不到全部麦田的一半，达到一百万株的田不到全部麦田的10％，而二十万株以下的田，还占相当大的数量。这是造成最高单产三千斤、最低单产不满百斤的不平衡的重要原因。因此，上述六项措施，应该以密植为统帅，实行以最高度的密植为中心的一系列的技术革新。只有跨上密植这一跃进马，突破百万株的关，才能激起社员的增产积极性，逼使其它各项措施提高到更高的限度。不敢跨上密植的马，也就不会带动其它各项丰产措施飞马跃进。因而，既要了解水、肥、土、种、密、管这六项措施是相互联系、互为作用、缺一不可的，又要肯定密植是保证小麦生产飞跃的中心点。
    密植增产的辩证法
    要建立以密植为中心的新的生产规程，就必然引起一场新与旧的、先进与保守的斗争。以辛堡村前任党支部书记和社主任为代表的保守派就反对密植，他们认为“密植一把草”，密植有“两坏”，即：穗小粒少、秆细易倒。煜辉社管理委员李玉杯，还抓住雄火社部分小麦倒伏的缺点讽刺地说：建议县委认真推广我们的稀植经验。并且摆出1956年某些社密植以后减了产的事例，反对实行高度的密植。
    密植是否真正有两坏呢？且以事实做证。雄火社第三生产队一亩二分试验田，每亩下籽二十五斤，有百余万株穗，每穗有籽八十粒到一百粒，最少的四十粒，产量三千一百三十五点四斤。全社小麦八百零二亩，全部用密植耧下种，一般都达到五十万株穗，平均亩产八百零二斤，最低亩产四百斤。辛堡农业社七百五十亩麦田，用七寸行距老耧下种。突破二十万株穗的有三百五十亩，二十万株以下的四百亩，其中十三万株穗的有六十亩，每穗籽粒多者达五十粒，一般的只有二十粒。全社平均亩产三百八十斤，其中百余亩亩产不足百斤。
  “相隔三里地，产量不一般，一个亩产八百多，一个只有三百三”。难道说辛堡农业社是因为过分密植而使产量低于雄火社的吗？不，辛堡农业社就根本不敢跨上密植的马，他们害怕密植以后会引起“过分紧张”。正因为不紧张，其它措施也就没有迎头赶上。如第七生产队共有一百二十亩麦田，深耕不过五寸，四十亩没有上粪，近地好地施肥也不过万斤。而雄火社不但深耕八寸到一尺，亩施肥料两万余斤，而且组织了小麦丰产研究组、坏地丰产管理组，认真加强了田间管理。这才是同样条件，产量悬殊的真正原因。
    密植了是否注定要倒伏呢？认为密植易倒也是一种形而上学的看法。因为实行密植是为了更合理地利用土地和阳光，科学的密植还可以防止倒伏。因此，辩论中对于防止倒伏也有两种不同的路线。一种是消极的怕倒伏，而不敢密植，少浇水；一种是积极的去加强一系列的增产措施。因为倒伏问题必须从各项生产因素中去找，雄火社检查小麦倒伏的原因是：深耕不足，底肥少，春季追氮肥太多，灌溉不合理，因而小麦根系发育不够健壮，春季分蘖太多，麦茎的组织疏松。明年要做到深耕尺五，合理配肥，饱施底肥（每亩五万到十万斤），追足冬肥，使麦苗在冬季一次分蘖完毕，严格控制春季分蘖，实行小畦浅浇等。这样，倒伏问题就可以防止。
    “密植元帅要升帐，必须依托众‘先行’”，说明了以密植为中心的各项丰产措施相互之间的辩证观点。有的人提出了“合理密植”，这也有两种看法。一种是让密植的标准，符合于生产大跃进前的其它各项生产措施的实施水平，这是保守派的理解。一种是以高度密植的水平，带动起一系列的农业技术大革新，这是革命派的理解。上纪落乡关于密植的辩论，革命派战胜了保守派，一致认为：要“跨上密植跃进马，突破百万株穗关，六项措施齐跃进，不获高产不由天。”
    事实出道理大破机械论
    建立一套以密植为中心的新的生产规程，永远保持小麦生产的高速度有没有可能呢？绝大多数人回答是肯定的。但是怀疑派也是存在的。这些怀疑派人数虽少，却满口条件论、速度递减论、平均速度论、偶然论和悲观论。所有这些论点都是机械论。当这种观点笼罩着人们的时候，总是谨小慎微，不敢相信自己的力量。因此，辩论会就“以实论虚”，大破机械论。
    条件论有两种，一种认为人家条件好可以跃进，我们条件坏只能慢进；一种认为生产水平低的社可以跃进，生产水平高的社潜力枯竭、生产到顶，只能慢进，不能跃进。
    事实出道理，雄火社的增产速度可以彻底驳倒上述两种论点。这个社1957年平均亩产小麦四百六十斤，是全县生产水平最高的社。今年仍然增产了75％。明年则要在亩产八百斤的基础上，单位产量再翻两番。该社第十生产队有二十亩七等地，去年每亩只产小麦六十斤。社员们为了彻底消灭百斤以下的田，提出“让七等地和一等地同样为人民服务”的口号，采取了一系列的措施。结果平均亩产六百余斤。其中有二点三亩历年捉不住苗的地，每亩产量达到二千三百九十一斤五两。这个跃进四十倍的速度，充分说明“事在人为，地在人种”，“只有坏作物，没有坏条件”。任何条件都不但可以跃进，而且可以飞进。我们主张辩证唯物主义的条件论，主张乐观主义的条件论：条件坏则潜力大，可以有四十倍或更高的增产速度；条件好则基础好，更容易发挥增产潜力，也可以创造数倍到数十倍的增产速度。
    偶然论的主要理由是“谋事在人，成事在天”，“个别容易普及难”。这是看不见全国工业、农业和科学文化事业飞速跃进的新形势的表现。与平均速度论一样，都是不相信人民群众的力量。他们虽然满口规律，但是他们只是罗列了一些表面现象，拼凑了几个个体经济时期农业增产速度的百分比，就以为找到了生产发展的规律。这种观点只不过说明思想的僵化而已，其错处在于静止地看问题。悲观论更是一种懦弱、自卑的表现。什么积肥没有肥源，深耕虽好牲口太弱，人能累死呀等等，总是困难重重，压得不能抬头。
    一场激烈的辩论，使人们明确了：机械论者永远是大自然的奴隶，我们则要做大自然的统治者和主人。事实正是如此：大自然专门与懦夫和懒汉做对，你越怕它，它越吝啬，你越敢压迫它，它就会以成百倍的报酬效劳你。因此，从辩证唯物论的观点出发，农业增产潜力是无穷无尽的，而人的能动性则是开发增产潜力的钥匙。机械论者的根本错误，就在于忽视了人的主观能动性，忽视了解放了的农民所具有的、改造自然的宏伟能力。
    树立共产主义的风格
    与农业生产上的各种机械论的斗争，归结起来是生产发展速度的快慢之争。而这种快慢之争，仍然体现着资本主义与社会主义两条道路的斗争。辛堡农业社就是因为资本主义的经营思想，在社内领导干部中占了上风，所以不去认真挖掘增产潜力，争取农业生产高速度前进，而是不服从国家计划管理，什么作物卖钱多经营什么，私开作坊、偷税走私、隐瞒产量。他们曾经自我夸耀地说：比产量我们社最低，比劳动日的报酬价值我们社最高呀！因此，参加辩论会的人一致认为：任何问题都必须社会主义思想“挂帅”，横扫资本主义的思想残余。辛堡农业社与雄火农业社的人口、土地数量和生产条件都相同，而产量和交售给国家的粮食却相差一倍。1957年雄火社实交售的公粮和余粮二十四万七千斤，辛堡社只有十二万二千斤。完全表现出两种不同的干劲和风格。因此，到会干部不但提出拔白旗、插红旗，学先进、赶先进、超先进；而且要比增产、比干劲、比贡献，树立高尚的共产主义的思想风格。
    总结丰产经验的新方法
    上纪落乡，大胆地用“就实论虚”的方法总结小麦丰产经验，从而把生产斗争中的实际经验提高到了理论的高度，为争取明年小麦生产的飞跃奠定了思想基础。这一总结丰产经验的新方法，使我们取得以下教益：
    （1）用理论与实践相结合的方法，剔除了具体生产经验中的糟粕，提取了其精华，从而使小麦丰产经验初步达到了系统化，为建立一套农业生产技术的新规格打下了基础。
    （2）正因为采用了“比比、算算”和“谈谈、论论”相结合的方法，就避免了单纯地罗列技术问题，使提高技术与解放思想结合了起来。因而，这是农业社红专学校从劳动群众中培养又红又专人材的重要方法。
    （3）此次辩论会证明：哲学并不神秘，唯物论辩证法并非深不可测。农民可以学哲学，可以纵谈辩证唯物论。并且，他们是实际生产经验的创造者，因而比起某些脱离实际的知识分子来是更容易掌握理论的。
