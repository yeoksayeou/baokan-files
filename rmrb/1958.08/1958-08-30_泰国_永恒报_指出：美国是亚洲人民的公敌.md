　　The United States is the Common Enemy of the Asian People
    Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Bangkok dispatch from TASS: Thailand's "Eternity Daily News" editorial pointed out that the threat of American imperialism to the Asian people is growing. American imperialism uses all means to create an atmosphere of mutual distrust among the people of Asian countries.
    In this regard, the "Eternity Daily News" particularly pointed out that American imperialists attempted to fabricate the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cambodia and the People's Republic of China as a "threat" to Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. The newspaper firmly condemned American interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries. The newspaper emphasized that if Thailand continues to support the arrogant policies of the United States, it will be tantamount to suicide.
