Notes

    Acting According to Circumstances
    After the United States and Britain were forced to recognize the Republic of Iraq, Hussein, the King of Jordan who had once proclaimed himself the head of the Iraq-Jordan Federation, had no choice but to announce on the 2nd that the federation no longer existed. His dream of being the "Head of the Federation" could not continue.
    Hussein's announcement is, of course, not surprising. A lackey always acts according to his master's wishes. More importantly, this fact shows that the newly established Republic of Iraq has gained a firm foothold, and the US and British imperialist plan to use the puppet Hussein to hold the broken spirit tablet of the Iraq-Jordan Federation to scare the young Republic of Iraq has failed.
    The Iraq-Jordan Federation was originally a tool used by imperialists to deal with the Arab national independence movement and to split Arab countries. However, in less than half a year, this federation came to an end. This shows that any attempt to rely on supporting tools against the Arab people to promote colonialism in the Middle East is bound to end in such a way.

    看眼色行事
    在美英被迫承认伊拉克共和国以后，曾经自封为伊拉克—约旦联邦元首的约旦国王侯赛因也不得不于2日宣布，这个联邦已经不再存在。他的“联邦元首”的美梦没有能做下去。
    侯赛因的这个宣布，自然不足为奇。奴才总是看主子眼色行事的。重要的是，这个事实说明，新生的伊拉克共和国站稳了，美英帝国主义企图使傀儡侯赛因抱着伊约联邦的破灵牌来吓唬年青的伊拉克共和国的计划已经遭到失败。
    伊拉克—约旦联邦本来是帝国主义者用来对付阿拉伯民族独立运动和分裂阿拉伯国家的工具。但是，不到半年，这个联邦就完蛋了。由此可见，企图依靠扶植反对阿拉伯人民的工具在中东推行殖民主义政策，就不能不遭到这样的下场。
