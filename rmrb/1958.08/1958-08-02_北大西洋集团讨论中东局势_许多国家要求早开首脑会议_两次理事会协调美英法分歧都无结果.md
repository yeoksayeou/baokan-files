Xinhua News Agency, August 1st, TASS, Paris, July 31st: The Standing Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been meeting continuously here, attempting to reconcile the differences between Britain and the United States on one hand, and France and other countries on the other, regarding the form and location of a summit conference to discuss the Middle East situation.

According to reports from various news agencies, the North Atlantic Group Council meeting on July 30th continued for more than five hours without achieving any results. According to these reports, twelve small countries in the North Atlantic Group demanded that agreement be reached as quickly as possible to convene a summit meeting.

According to Agence France-Presse, at the North Atlantic Group Council meeting on July 31st, another attempt was made to bring the views of Britain, the United States, and France closer together, but to no avail. Representatives of these countries continued to adhere to their previous positions.

Judging from the reports of various news agencies, the main reason for the differences among the three Western countries is that France's request to hold a summit meeting in Europe has not been agreed to by Britain and the United States.

    北大西洋集团讨论中东局势
    许多国家要求早开首脑会议
    两次理事会协调美英法分歧都无结果
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社巴黎7月31日讯：北大西洋公约组织理事会常任理事会议在这里连续开会，会议企图调解英国和美国同法国和其他国家之间在关于讨论中东局势的政府首脑会议的形式和地点问题上的分歧。
    据各国通讯社报道，北大西洋集团理事会7月30日的会议继续了五个多小时，没有取得任何结果。据这些消息说，北大西洋集团的十二个小国要求，尽可能快地同意召开最高级会议。
    据法新社报道，在北大西洋集团理事会7月31日的会议上，再一次企图使英国、美国同法国的观点相接近，但是毫无结果，这些国家的代表仍然坚持从前的立场。
  根据各家通讯社的报道判断，三个西方国家分歧的主要原因是，法国关于在欧洲召开政府首脑会议的要求没有得到英国和美国的同意。
