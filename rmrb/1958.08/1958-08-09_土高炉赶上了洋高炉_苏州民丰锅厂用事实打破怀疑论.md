Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th: The indigenous blast furnaces of the Suzhou Minfeng Boiler Factory are shining brightly, with iron output and quality rapidly catching up with newly built foreign blast furnaces, and the utilization coefficient exceeding design requirements. The 0.25 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace they built has a daily output of 600 jin, with a utilization coefficient of 0.85. Another 0.18 cubic meter furnace burning white coal also produces 600 jin of iron per day, translating to a utilization coefficient of 0.6, exceeding the level of general foreign blast furnaces. The iron produced by both furnaces is of very good quality. This fact once again powerfully refutes the superstition of "indigenous is inferior to foreign" and "small is inferior to large," and shatters the various hesitations and excuses of the "indigenous furnace skeptics."

The 0.25 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace initially built by the Minfeng Boiler Factory experienced abnormal production for a time, and some people had various doubts. Later, the factory's leaders mobilized the workers and, based on the problems existing in indigenous blast furnace iron smelting, conducted research and improvement one by one. As a result, after this indigenous blast furnace was put into production on July 13, the situation gradually normalized. The iron tapping time was reduced from three hours to two hours, and the amount of iron tapped each time increased from more than 20 jin to more than 40 jin. From the 16th, the daily output reached 600 jin, and the coke consumption also decreased from 2.5:1 to 1.67:1, thus reducing the cost of pig iron by nearly half compared to June. The furnace can be continuously fired for at least ten days before being overhauled.

The CPC Suzhou Municipal Committee attaches great importance to the creations of the Minfeng Factory and specifically held an on-site meeting at the factory, requiring all units in the city to learn from the Minfeng Factory's experience, to engage in indigenous and small-scale production, and to vigorously build 0.18 to 0.25 cubic meter indigenous blast furnaces.

### 土高炉赶上了洋高炉  苏州民丰锅厂用事实打破怀疑论

    土高炉赶上了洋高炉
    苏州民丰锅厂用事实打破怀疑论
    据新华社南京8日电  苏州市民丰锅厂的土炉大放光彩，出铁产量和质量快步赶上了一般新砌的洋高炉，利用系数超过了设计要求。他们建造的零点二五立方公尺土高炉日产量已达六百市斤，利用系数为零点八五，另一座烧白煤的零点一八立方公尺的炉子，日产铁量也达六百市斤，折算利用系数为零点六，超过了一般洋高炉的水平。两个炉子出的铁质量都很好。这一事实再一次有力地批驳了“土不如洋”、“小不如大”的迷信，打破了“土炉怀疑派”的种种犹豫和借口。
    民丰锅厂初建的零点二五立方公尺的土高炉，生产一度不正常，有人曾发生种种怀疑。后来，这个厂的领导人员发动工人，根据土高炉炼铁中存在的问题，逐一进行研究和改进。这样，这个土高炉从7月13日投入生产后，情况便日益正常，出铁时间由过去三小时一次减少为二小时一次，每次出铁量由二十多斤提高到四十多斤，16日起日产量已达六百市斤，焦炭耗用量也由过去二点五比一降为一点六七比一，生铁的成本因此比6月份降低了近一半。炉子至少可连续烧十天再作检修。
    中共苏州市委极其重视民丰厂的创造，专门在这个厂举行现场会议，要求全市各单位学习民丰厂经验，搞土搞小，大力建设零点一八到零点二五立方公尺的土高炉。
