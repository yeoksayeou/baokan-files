　　The policy of "the whole people running the iron and steel industry" has been grasped by hundreds of millions of people and has become a huge material force. In the past seven months or so, the production and construction of China's iron and steel industry have developed at an unprecedented speed. According to statistics from January to June, pig iron production exceeded the production increase and savings plan by 360,000 tons, steel by 70,000 tons, and steel materials by 150,000 tons. These represent increases of about 25% to 32% compared to the same period last year. Several important types of steel that China has traditionally lacked, such as heavy steel rails, silicon steel sheets, medium and thick steel plates, thin plates, and seamless steel pipes, have also increased by 26% to 142% compared to the same period last year. In addition, more than 200 important new products have been successfully trial-produced. In terms of construction, as of the end of July, more than 30,000 indigenous small blast furnaces have been built across the country, far exceeding the blast furnace construction targets proposed by various provinces and cities at the local metallurgical conference in April this year. However, whether viewed from the perspective of meeting current needs, ensuring a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture next year, or the leap forward plans proposed by various enterprises, the achievements already made are far from sufficient. Therefore, we must make persistent efforts to advance at a higher speed, and in the coming months, do everything possible to complete the leap forward plan for steel production, and only increase, not decrease, production.

　　Then, is it possible to complete the leap forward plan and advance at a higher speed? The answer is that it is entirely possible, and the conditions are sufficient. This is because a mass movement of the whole people to make iron and steel has been launched throughout the country. Under the strong leadership of putting politics in command and the secretaries in command, this movement is like a surging tide, unstoppable. This is the most important condition for completing the leap forward plan.

　　Specifically, in terms of production, one of the possibilities for completing the leap forward plan is that more than 30,000 newly built indigenous small blast furnaces are already in operation. These are fresh troops. In the past, due to a lack of technical operational experience and other reasons, many of them have not been put into production in a timely manner, and some of those that have been put into production have not been able to produce iron normally, and the equipment capacity has not been fully utilized. Now, on the one hand, the National Local Blast Furnace On-site Conference held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Shaoyang has summarized the experience of normal iron production. On the other hand, many experiences of high-yield small blast furnaces have emerged in various places. As long as we quickly organize and promote these experiences, all small blast furnaces can be put into normal production.

　　The normal production of small blast furnaces (indigenous blast furnaces, semi-foreign and semi-indigenous small blast furnaces) has particularly important significance at present. Because whether the leap forward plan for steel production can be completed depends on pig iron, and the key to rapid iron production and increased iron production lies in small blast furnaces. Therefore, as long as provinces, cities, and autonomous regions accelerate the development of the mass movement to build small blast furnaces and exchange experiences in iron production of various types of small blast furnaces in a timely manner, so that all small blast furnaces can quickly carry out normal production, it will provide a basic guarantee for completing the leap forward plan for steel production.

　　The second possibility for completing the leap forward plan for steel production is that the original large and medium-sized modern iron and steel enterprises still have great potential. The difference between advanced and backward is great between these enterprises and between the various blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces within the enterprises. Taking the blast furnace effective volume utilization coefficient (the number of cubic meters of furnace body occupied by refining one ton of iron per day and night, the lower the more advanced) as an example, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has reduced it to 0.531, while the national average coefficient is still above 0.6. If the utilization coefficient of all blast furnaces in the country is reduced to below 0.6, then more than one million tons of pig iron can be produced in the coming months. Taking the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces (output per square meter of furnace bottom per day and night, the higher the coefficient, the more advanced) as an example, in the first half of this year, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant averaged more than 12 tons, while some steel plants were less than 8 tons, a difference of more than one-third. The equipment of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant is not better than other plants, and the equipment of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is also poor, and manual charging is used. Why can't other factories do what the workers of these two factories can do?

　　In terms of capital construction, we have broken the mysterious concept of running the iron and steel industry, liberated our minds, and learned the skills. We also have past experiences to draw on, so we can avoid detours or take fewer detours. For example, in the past, some blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces newly built in some places were relatively far from the mines, and raw material supply became difficult after they were put into production. A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit. Such shortcomings can be completely avoided in the future. Therefore, as long as we continue to implement the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, with small and medium-sized enterprises as the main focus, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, under the conditions of centralized leadership and overall planning, we can not only build tens of thousands more small blast furnaces and thousands of small converters by riding the wind and waves, but also build them better and faster. Since we have accumulated certain construction experience, while accelerating the construction of small blast furnaces and small converters, we can also accelerate the construction of large and medium-sized modern iron and steel enterprises. Large and medium-sized modern enterprises have large output and high efficiency. If they can shorten the construction period as much as possible and put them into production as soon as possible, it will be of great significance for completing this year's leap forward plan and ensuring a greater leap forward next year.

　　In terms of equipment manufacturing, the most important thing at present is the manufacturing of iron and steel smelting equipment. Now many machinery factories have put the manufacturing of equipment for the iron and steel industry in the first place, and put forward the slogan of "stopping the car to give way and letting the steel marshal ascend the tent." As long as we continue to mobilize the masses and take concrete measures, we can speed up the manufacturing of smelting equipment.

　　The above facts show that there is a great possibility to advance at a higher speed and complete the leap forward plan for output. The key now lies in whether we have a high-speed ideology that correctly reflects this objective possibility. With a high-speed ideology, we can mobilize millions of people to do everything possible to turn possibility into reality. Of course, to advance at a higher speed than in the past few months, we need to make greater efforts, and the difficulties in our work will be greater, and the work in all aspects will be more tense. However, this is the difficulty and tension of striving for initiative in the course of progress. The iron and steel industry is the foundation of the entire industry, the key link of the entire industry, and the marshal of the entire industry. The lack of steel is the main contradiction in current industrial production and construction. If the iron and steel industry can complete the leap forward plan, our work in all aspects will be easier and more proactive. Otherwise, it will not only affect the construction speed in all aspects this year, but also affect the construction speed next year and the year after.

　　To advance at high speed and complete the leap forward plan, we must take various concrete measures. These measures may vary from time to time and from place to place, but the most fundamental and universal measure is that the Party Committee secretaries at all levels personally take charge, mobilize the masses, and carry out technical innovation in a big way. Now the workers have a great deal of energy, "I only fear that you can't think of it, I don't fear that you can't do it". Wherever the Party points, they will charge there. Now the task of the leadership is to guide the soaring energy of the masses to the goal of completing the leap forward plan, and to closely combine technical innovation with the current production and construction, and correct the tendency of engaging in technical innovation in isolation and neglecting the current production and construction tasks. If the output of the blast furnace is low, mobilize the masses to reduce the utilization coefficient; if the output of the open hearth furnace is low, mobilize the masses to improve the utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace; if the labor force is tight, mobilize the masses to improve tools, improve equipment, and improve technology to increase labor efficiency. In short, what production needs, mobilize the masses to innovate what, where there is a weak link, mobilize the masses to innovate where. Every innovation, every invention, must be able to directly promote the progress of production and construction. The Party Committee secretary should also frequently mobilize the masses to check ideas, check energy, check style, check plans, check measures, and check collaboration, using the virtual to drive the real. Like commanding a battle, fight one battle after another, achieve one indicator, and immediately put forward new indicators. "Running water does not go bad, and a door pivot does not get worm-eaten". Constantly check, constantly put forward new tasks, and constantly make revolution, people's thinking will be constantly improved, their energy will be constantly increased, and production and construction will also be thriving.

　　Accelerating the development of the iron and steel industry is not only a matter for the metallurgical industry department, but a matter for the whole people. Other industrial departments, especially the machinery industry, non-ferrous metal industry, coal industry, power industry, and transportation departments, which are directly related to the iron and steel industry, must consciously place the contradictions of their own departments and enterprises under the main contradiction of the iron and steel industry, and subordinate partial interests to overall interests, promote the spirit of communist mutual assistance and cooperation, and regard supporting the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry as their primary political task. Because the metallurgical equipment needed at present is particularly urgent, machinery manufacturing enterprises must put the production of metallurgical equipment in the first place and do everything possible to meet the needs of the iron and steel industry. It is hoped that Party committees at all levels will often grasp collaboration, commend those enterprises that have shown a spirit of self-sacrifice in supporting the iron and steel industry, and establish a communist red banner. In this way, the strength of all parties can be unified and twisted into one rope, heading towards one goal - fighting for steel!

　　紧紧抓住钢铁生产
    “全民办钢铁工业”的方针已经为亿万群众所掌握，并且变成了巨大的物质力量。在过去的七个多月里，我国钢铁工业的生产和建设，都以空前的速度发展着。根据1至6月的统计，生铁的产量比增产节约计划还要增多三十六万吨，钢增多七万吨，钢材增多十五万吨。这些约比去年同期增长了25％到32％。我国一向比较缺少的几种重要钢材，如重型钢轨、矽钢片、中厚钢板、薄板、无缝钢管等，也比去年同期增长了26％到142％。另外还试制成功二百多种重要新产品。在建设方面，截至7月底，各地已经建成了土小高炉三万座以上，远远超过了今年4月间地方冶金会议上各省市提出的高炉建设指标。但是，不论从满足当前的需要来看，从保证明年工农业更大的跃进来看，或者从各个企业提出的跃进计划来看，现在已经取得的成就都还很不够。因此，我们必须再接再厉，以更高的速度前进，在今后几个月内，千方百计地完成钢铁产量的跃进计划，只能多不能少。
    那末，完成跃进计划、以更高的速度前进，有没有可能呢？答复是完全有可能，条件是足够的。这是因为在全国范围内，已经展开了一个全民炼钢铁的群众运动。这个运动在政治挂帅、书记挂帅的坚强领导下，势如潮涌，锐不可当。这是完成跃进计划的最重要条件。
    具体来看，在生产方面，完成跃进计划的可能性之一，就是已经新建成了三万多座土小高炉。这是一批生力军，过去由于缺乏技术操作经验等原因，它们有许多还没有及时投入生产，已投入生产的，也有一部分不能正常出铁，设备能力还没有充分利用起来。现在，一方面，冶金工业部在邵阳召开的全国地方高炉现场会议已经总结了正常出铁的经验，另一方面，各地陆续出现了许多小高炉丰产的经验。只要我们很快地组织推广这些经验，就可以使所有的小高炉转入正常生产。
    小高炉（土高炉、半洋半土的小高炉）的正常生产，在目前有特别重要的意义。因为能否完成钢铁生产的跃进计划，关键在于生铁，而要快出铁、多出铁，关键又在于小高炉。因此，只要各省市、自治区更快地发展建设小高炉的群众运动，及时交流各种类型的小高炉的出铁经验，使一切小高炉都迅速地进行正常生产，就为完成钢铁生产的跃进计划提供基本的保证。
    完成钢铁产量跃进计划的可能性之二，就是原有的大、中型现代钢铁企业还有很大的潜力。这些企业之间、企业内部各个高炉、平炉之间，先进与落后的差别是很大的。拿高炉有效容积利用系数（每昼夜炼一吨铁平均占用的炉体立方公尺数，越低越先进）来说，本溪第一炼铁厂已经降低到零点五三一，而全国的平均系数仍在零点六以上。如果全国所有的高炉利用系数都降低到零点六以下，那末在今后几个月内，就可以多生产生铁一百多万吨。再拿平炉的利用系数（每平方公尺炉底每昼夜的产量，系数越高越先进）来说，今年上半年，上海第三钢厂平均在十二吨以上，而有的钢铁厂还不到八吨，相差三分之一以上。本溪第一炼铁厂的设备并不比其它厂的好，上海第三钢厂的设备也差，是用人工加料的，这两个厂的职工能够做到的事情，为什么别的工厂做不到呢？
    在基本建设方面，我们已经破除了对于办钢铁工业的神秘观念，思想得到了解放，学会了本领。还有过去的经验作借鉴，可以不走弯路或少走弯路。例如过去有些地方新建设的高炉和平炉离矿山比较远，投入生产以后原料供应发生困难。吃一堑，长一智，这样的缺点在今后就完全可以避免。因此，只要我们在集中领导、全面规划的条件下，继续贯彻执行大中小型企业同时并举、以中小为主，土洋结合的方针，乘风破浪，不但可以再建设几万座小高炉、成千座小转炉，而且完全可能建设得更好，更快。由于我们已经积累了一定的建设经验，在加速建设小高炉、小转炉的同时，还可以加速建设大、中型的现代钢铁企业。大、中型的现代企业产量大、效率高。它们如果能够尽可能缩短建设期限，尽早投入生产，对完成今年的跃进计划和保证明年更大的跃进，都具有十分重大的意义。
    在设备制造方面，当前最重要的是钢铁冶炼设备的制造。现在许多机械工厂已把为钢铁工业制造设备放在第一位，提出“停车让路，让钢铁元帅升帐”的口号。只要我们继续发动群众，采取具体措施，就能加快冶炼设备制造的速度。
    上面的事实说明，要以更高的速度前进，要完成产量的跃进计划的可能性是很大的。现在的关键就在于我们有没有正确反映这种客观可能性的高速度思想。有了高速度思想，才能动员千百万群众千方百计地变可能性为现实。当然，要以比过去几个月更高的速度前进，就需要我们作更大的努力，工作中的困难也会多一些，各方面的工作也会更紧张。但是，这是在前进中力争主动的困难和紧张。钢铁工业是整个工业的基础，是整个工业的纲，是整个工业的元帅。缺乏钢铁，这是当前工业生产和建设中的主要矛盾。钢铁工业要能完成跃进计划，我们的各方面工作就比较好办，就比较主动。否则，不仅会影响今年各方面的建设速度，还要影响明年和后年的建设速度。
    要高速度地前进，要完成跃进计划，我们必须采取各种具体的措施。这些措施可能因时因地而不同，但是有一条最根本最普遍的措施，这就是各级党委书记亲自挂帅，发动群众，大搞技术革新。现在工人群众的干劲很大，“只怕想不到，不怕做不到”，党指向哪里，他们就往哪里冲锋。现在领导的任务，就是把群众的冲天干劲引导到完成跃进计划的目标上来，把技术革新与当前的生产和建设密切结合起来，纠正那种孤立搞技术革新而忽视当前生产和建设任务的偏向。如果高炉产量低，就发动群众降低利用系数；如果平炉产量低，就发动群众提高平炉利用系数；如果劳动力紧张，就发动群众改进工具、改进设备、改进技术，提高劳动效率。总之，生产需要什么，就发动群众革新什么，哪里有薄弱环节，就发动群众在哪里革新。每一项革新，每一项创造发明，都要能够直接推动生产和建设前进一步。党委书记还要经常发动群众，查思想、查干劲、查风格、查计划、查措施、查协作，以虚带实。像指挥作战一样，打完一个战役再打一个战役，达到了一个指标，立即提出新的指标。“流水不腐，户枢不蠹”，不断检查，不断提出新任务，不断革命，人们的思想就不断提高，干劲就不断加大，生产和建设也就蒸蒸日上。
    加速发展钢铁工业，不仅仅是冶金工业部门的事情，而是全民的事情。别的工业部门，特别是与钢铁工业有直接关系的机械工业、有色金属工业、煤炭工业、电力工业和交通运输部门，必须自觉地将自己部门、自己企业的矛盾置于钢铁工业主要矛盾之下，局部利益服从整体利益，发扬共产主义的互助协作精神，把支援钢铁工业的高速度发展看作是自己的首要政治任务。由于目前需要的冶金设备特别迫切，机械制造企业必须把冶金设备的生产摆在第一位，千方百计地满足钢铁工业的需要。希望各级党委经常抓协作，表扬那些在支援钢铁工业中表现自我牺牲精神的企业，树立共产主义红旗。这样，才可以把各方面的力量统一起来，拧成一股劲，奔向一个目标——为钢铁而战！
