Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 18th. The Secretary-General of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, Sebaei, sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 17th, requesting his immediate intervention to rescind the death sentence handed down by the Jordanian authorities to Jordanian young woman Nadia Salty. Nadia is one of the thirteen Jordanian patriots recently sentenced to death by the Jordanian authorities on the charge of so-called "conspiracy to subvert the government."

In the telegram, Sebaei condemned the brutal act of sentencing Nadia and other Jordanian nationalists to death, and pointed out that this verdict violated the principles of the United Nations and the most basic human rights.

Jordanian students in Cairo also issued a statement on the evening of the 17th, demanding that the Arab people and the people of the world use all means to stop this barbaric act and save the lives of Nadia and other Jordanian patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 17th. The "Al-Akhbar" newspaper in Cairo reported on the 17th about the patriotic actions of Jordanian young patriotic woman Nadia and called on world public opinion to stop the Hussein authorities of Jordan from sentencing her to death on trumped-up charges.

The newspaper wrote that Nadia is a 23-year-old university graduate. When she saw British troops occupying Jordan and Hussein's traitorous acts, her anger and hatred towards the enemy turned her into a brave patriotic youth. She claimed that she would avenge the honor of her country, which had been sullied by Hussein. She told her interrogators that if she could get close to Hussein's palace, she would blow it up.

Along with Nadia, twelve other young Jordanian patriots were sentenced to death. Their arrest caused the entire Jordan to boil over. The Jordanian authorities were very panicked. All women were subjected to police attention, and women's handbags were also searched.

It is reported that the British aggressor authorities in Jordan and the small Hussein dynasty are worried that once Nadia and other patriotic youths are executed, the flames of anger of the Jordanian people will burn everywhere, which will have serious consequences for Hussein and the British occupation forces.

　　不许侯赛因杀害纳迪亚！
　　亚非人民团结理事会总书记电联合国
　  要求制止约旦当局迫害爱国者的暴行
    新华社开罗18日电　亚非人民团结理事会总书记西巴伊17日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求他立即进行干涉，以撤销约旦当局对约旦女青年纳迪亚·萨勒提判处的死刑。纳迪亚是最近被约旦当局以所谓“阴谋颠覆政府”罪名判处死刑的十三名约旦爱国者中的一位。
    西巴伊在电报中谴责了判处纳迪亚和约旦其它民族主义者死刑的残暴行为，并且指出这个判决违反了联合国原则和最基本的人权。
    在开罗的约旦学生17日傍晚也发表声明，要求阿拉伯人和全世界人民用一切办法来制止这种野蛮的行为，挽救纳迪亚和其他约旦爱国者的生命。
    新华社开罗17日电　开罗“消息报”在17日报道了约旦女爱国青年纳迪亚的爱国行为，并且要求世界舆论制止约旦侯赛因当局以捏造的罪名判处她的死刑。
    这家报纸写道，纳迪亚是一位二十三岁的大学毕业生，当她看到英国军队侵占约旦和侯赛因的卖国行为时，对敌人的愤怒和仇恨使她变成一位勇敢的爱国青年。她声称要为她的国家的被侯赛因所沾污了的荣誉报复。她对审讯她的人说，如果她能够走近侯赛因王宫的话，她就要炸毁王宫。
    同纳迪亚同时被判处死刑的还有另外十二名约旦爱国青年。他们的被捕使整个约旦沸腾了。约旦当局十分恐慌。所有妇女都受到了警察的注意，妇女的手提包也要遭到搜查。
    据报道，英国在约旦的侵略军当局和侯赛因小王朝都担心纳迪亚和其他爱国青年一旦被处死，约旦人民愤怒的火焰将会到处燃烧起来，这对侯赛因和英国占领军将会产生严重的后果。
