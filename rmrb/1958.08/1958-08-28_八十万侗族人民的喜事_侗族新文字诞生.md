Xinhua News Agency report: The Dong people's long-awaited own script has been born at the scientific discussion meeting on Dong language and writing problems held in Guiyang. This is of great significance to the great leap forward in the economic and cultural construction of the 800,000 Dong people who live in Guizhou, Hunan, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

This meeting was commissioned by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and convened by the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee.

After a full discussion and research on the Dong language situation and the Dong script plan (draft), the meeting participants unanimously agreed that the phonology, grammar, and vocabulary of the Dong language in various regions are basically the same, but there are still certain differences between the northern and southern regions where the Dong people live. In a few areas, the vocabulary of individual spots appears to be special. Therefore, the meeting believes that the Dong language should be divided into two dialects: north and south.

Regarding the standard pronunciation of the Dong language, everyone believes that the phonological system of the Rongjiang Dong dialect in Guizhou is basically the same as that of the Dong language in various regions, and it is highly representative of the Dong language. Therefore, it was selected as the standard pronunciation of the Dong language. However, in the work of formulating standard language norms, the universality of the language should be appropriately taken into account.

　　八十万侗族人民的喜事
    侗族新文字诞生
    据新华社讯　侗族人民渴望已久的本民族文字，已在贵阳市举行的侗族语言文字问题科学讨论会上诞生了。这对聚居在贵州、湖南和广西僮族自治区的八十多万侗族人民的经济文化建设大跃进，有着重要的意义。
    这次会议是中华人民共和国民族事务委员会委托贵州省人民委员会召开的。
    会议对侗族语言情况和侗文方案（草案）进行了充分讨论研究以后，大家一致认为：各地侗族的语音、语法和词汇基本上是一致的，但是侗族聚居的北部地区和南部地区还有一定的差别，在少数地区个别点的词汇还显得特殊。因此，会议认为侗语应该划分为南北两个方言。
    关于侗语的标准音问题，大家认为贵州榕江侗话的语音系统和各地侗语基本上是一致的，它在侗族语言中有很大的代表性，因此，选定为侗语的标准音，但在制定标准语规范的工作中，要适当地照顾到语言的普遍性。
