Xinhua News Agency, August 24th dispatch from Paris: News from French territories in Africa indicates that French Prime Minister De Gaulle's activities in peddling France's reactionary new "constitution" in these regions have been met with a cold reception. De Gaulle left Paris on the 20th. In recent days, he has successively visited Tananarive, the capital of Madagascar, and Brazzaville, the capital of French Equatorial Africa.

De Gaulle's drafted reactionary new "constitution" draft makes no mention of allowing the overseas territories to become independent. This has been universally opposed by the people in these places. On the morning of De Gaulle's arrival in Brazzaville on the 23rd, the speaker of the "Grand Council of French Africa," Boganda, handed a memorandum jointly signed by the leaders of the major political parties in the region to French Commissioner I. Bouchet, requesting that the French new "constitution" draft include the clause "France recognizes the independence of its overseas territories." De Gaulle later made a special trip to talk to Boganda, attempting to deceive him.

In order to trick the colonial people into voting in favor of his new "constitution" in the referendum at the end of September, De Gaulle hypocritically said in a speech to officials of French Equatorial Africa on the 23rd that France will form a "community" with its overseas territories in the future, in which each territory will have the right to "govern and manage its own affairs." However, he also said that rights such as diplomacy, defense, and currency will be "jointly controlled" by France and them.

De Gaulle also delivered a similar speech the day before when he visited Tananarive, the capital of Madagascar. However, when De Gaulle learned that Madagascar Prime Minister Tsiranana had publicly stated at a press conference that day that he demanded that France immediately abolish the law of 1896 incorporating Madagascar into France, he immediately revealed the face of a colonialist, warning Madagascar not to take the "separatist" path of breaking away from France and becoming a completely independent country. News said that residents of Madagascar reacted coldly to De Gaulle's speech.

In order to protest against De Gaulle's visit, trade union leaders in Dakar, the capital of French West Africa, have already issued a call on the 23rd for a general strike of electricity, transportation, and sanitation workers in the city on the 24th.

The "Voice of Free Algeria" radio station announced on the 22nd that the Algerian National Liberation Front has ordered its army and underground organizations to intensify their struggle to thwart the French government's conspiracy to hold a referendum in Algeria to pass De Gaulle's constitution.

　　兜售法国反动的新宪法
    戴高乐在法属非洲碰钉子
    阿民族解放阵线下令加紧斗争挫败戴高乐阴谋
    据新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：来自非洲法属领地的消息表明，法国总理戴高乐在这些地区兜售法国反动的新“宪法”的活动遭到了冷遇。戴高乐是20日离开巴黎的。连日来他先后访问了马达加斯加岛的首府塔那那利佛和法属赤道非洲的首府布拉柴维尔。
    戴高乐草拟的反动新“宪法”草案中绝口不提准许各海外领地独立的问题。这一点遭到了这些地方人民的普遍反对。在戴高乐23日到达布拉柴维尔市的当天早上，“法属非洲大议会，”议长波冈达曾经把一件由这个地区各主要政党领袖联名签署的备忘录交给法国专员伊·布歇，要求在法国新“宪法”草案中加上“法国承认其海外领地独立”的条款。戴高乐后来特地来找波冈达进行谈话，企图对他进行哄骗。
    为了骗取殖民地人民在9月底有关新“宪法”的全民投票中投票支持他，戴高乐23日在对法属赤道非洲的官员们发表谈话时假惺惺地说，今后法国将同它的海外领地组成一个“共同体”，其中每个领地将有权“治理和管理自己的事务”。但是，他又说，外交、防务和货币等权利将由法国同它们“共同掌握”。
    戴高乐在前一天访问马达加斯加岛首府塔那那利佛时也曾发表类似的演说。但是，当戴高乐获悉马达加斯加岛总理齐腊纳纳当天在记者招待会上曾经公开表示要求法国立即取消1896年把马达加斯加岛并入法国的法律时，他马上露出了殖民主义者的面目，警告马达加斯加不得走脱离法国而成为完全独立的国家这样一条“分离”的道路。消息说，马达加斯加居民对戴高乐的演说反应很冷淡。
    为了对戴高乐的来访表示抗议，法属西非首府达喀尔市的工会领导人已经在23日发出号召，要全市电力、交通运输和清洁工人在24日举行总罢工。
    “自由阿尔及利亚之声”电台22日宣布，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线已经命令它的军队和地下组织加紧进行斗争，以挫败法国政府在阿尔及利亚举行全民投票通过戴高乐宪法的阴谋。
