Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, August 20th: According to a report in the "Dawn" newspaper on the 19th, the Foreign Aid Investigation Committee, commissioned by Pakistani Finance Minister Amjad Ali, stated in a report submitted to the Pakistani Central Cabinet that "foreign aid should not continue beyond the shortest possible necessary period."

　　This secret report reveals the fact that U.S. "aid" with attached conditions has not brought any benefits to Pakistan. It said that the effectiveness of U.S. "aid" to Pakistan has been greatly reduced due to the additional conditions stipulated regarding the purchase of goods and the transportation of materials. The report said that the United States International Cooperation Administration sometimes requires countries receiving "aid" to purchase goods from the United States at relatively high prices, which greatly reduces the value of the "aid" given to Pakistan.

　　Regarding the American technical personnel in Pakistan, the report said that the cost required for each of them per year is approximately $25,000 and 24,000 Pakistani rupees. That is to say, the cost required for each of these technical personnel per month reaches about 12,000 rupees. However, on the other hand, the report revealed that some of these highly paid American technical "experts" are "inexperienced" and sometimes "lack cooperation" with Pakistani technical personnel. The report said that the "attitude that employing foreign experts can solve problems" should be "corrected."

### 巴外援调查委员会得出结论  美“援”对巴基斯坦没好处

　　巴外援调查委员会得出结论
    美“援”对巴基斯坦没好处
    新华社卡拉奇20日电  据“黎明报”19日报道，由巴基斯坦财政部长阿姆贾德·阿里委派的外援调查委员会在向巴基斯坦中央内阁提出的一份报告中说，“外援在所必须的最短期限以后不应继续下去”。
    这项秘密报告透露了附有条件的美“援”对巴基斯坦并没有带来什么好处的事实。它说，美国给巴基斯坦的“援助”的效用由于规定了关于购买货物和运输物资等方面的附加条件而大大减少。报告说，美国国际合作署有时候要接受“援助”的国家以比较高的价格向美国购买货物，这就使得给予巴基斯坦的“援助”的价值去掉很大一部分。
    报告在谈到美国在巴基斯坦的技术人员时说，他们每人每年所需要的费用约为二万五千美元和两万四千巴基斯坦卢比。这就是说，这些技术人员每人每月所需费用达一万二千卢比左右。但是，另一方面，据报告透露，这些合乎高薪的美国技术“专家”有的却“没有经验”，有时候还同巴基斯坦的技术人员“缺乏协作”。报告说，应该“纠正雇用外国专家就能解决问题的态度”。
