Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th. Hubei Province's renowned national "Thousand-Jin County," Xiaogan County, has witnessed a brilliant early rice harvest this year. The county's 300,200 mu of early rice, after harvesting and repeated verification, achieved a total output of over 530 million jin, with an average yield of over 1,755 jin per mu, nearly doubling the early rice yield of 617 jin per mu last year.

The 200,000 mu high-yield demonstration area, jointly guided by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Secretariat, and the First Secretaries of the Xiaogan Prefectural and County Party Committees, achieved an average yield of 2,335 jin per mu for over 100,900 mu of early rice. In Wolong, Longdian, Zhuzhan, Xiaogang, Pengxing and other districts, yields of 5,000 jin, 7,000 jin, and 8,000 jin per mu were common. To date, there are as many as sixteen plots in the county with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu (each plot being over one mu in size). Among them, the experimental plot jointly cultivated by National Model Worker Guan Musheng, director of the Changfeng Cooperative, and a youth shock brigade, achieved a yield of over 15,000 jin per mu.

Due to the large-scale bumper harvests and the emergence of thousands upon thousands of high-yield fields, many high-yield townships and agricultural cooperatives have emerged throughout the county. According to statistics, there are 28 townships with an average yield of 2,000 jin to 2,800 jin per mu, 319 cooperatives with an average yield of 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu. In addition, 30 cooperatives have achieved an average yield of over 3,000 jin per mu. From this early rice harvest alone, the 710,000 agricultural population of Xiaogan County has an average of 746 jin of grain per person, which is more than the average total grain volume per person throughout 1955.

Xiaogan County had previously debated the issue, with many believing that the county's complex terrain and uneven distribution of soil quality determined that natural conditions limited rapid production growth. What is the reality now? Whether in plains, hills, or mountainous areas, and whether the soil is fertile or barren, bumper harvests have been achieved, and a large number of high-yield models have emerged.

Xiaogan County's early rice bumper harvest has come from a road of constant struggle. In order to overcome various conservative ideologies, the Party led the masses in carrying out extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters. During this period, a total of more than 270,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the county. In particular, the practice of cadres creating model plots (experimental fields) and then organizing on-site visits and debates proved extremely effective. This greatly liberated thinking, dispelled superstitions, and therefore deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilizer application were all done better than in previous years. Field management was also tightened this year. In addition, they overcame the serious threat of sixty to seventy days of drought.

Due to the bumper early rice harvest, the thinking of the farmers in Xiaogan County has been further liberated. Recently, they have been summarizing the experience of early rice bumper harvests. Due to the still prominent phenomenon of imbalanced yields, it is generally believed that the potential for increasing rice production is still very large. Therefore, people are determined to take advantage of the victory and strive to achieve an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu throughout the county this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th. The 2.5 million mu of early rice planted in Anqing Special District, Anhui Province, has been basically harvested. The total output of early rice is 282.5 million jin, with an average yield of 1,130 jin per mu. This total output is three times greater than the total output of early rice in the entire special district last year.

This year, various localities have also created many high-yield records for early rice. As of August 4, statistics show that there are 211,653 mu with yields of over 2,000 jin per mu; 12,263 mu with yields of over 3,000 jin per mu; 311 mu with yields of over 4,000 jin per mu; 81.9 mu with yields of over 5,000 jin per mu; 12.8 mu with yields of over 6,000 jin per mu; 16.2 mu with yields of 7,000 jin to 9,000 jin per mu; and 2.58 mu with yields of over 10,000 jin per mu.

The main reason for the large-scale bumper harvest in Anqing Special District is that in all aspects of rice production, politics is put in command, and the Party's General Line and the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee are conscientiously and deeply implemented, and the struggle against right-leaning and conservative thinking is carried out, which is of decisive significance for achieving a bumper harvest this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th. By early August, the 24.94 million mu of early rice in Jiangxi Province had been completely harvested, with a total output of 14.32 billion jin and an average yield of 574 jin per mu. This year's early rice production increased by 8.42 billion jin compared to last year, an increase of 143%. Based on the province's urban and rural population of 18.4 million, the average grain per person is 778 jin.

In Jiangxi Province, the counties whose yield in a single season of early rice exceeded the 800 jin per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) include Xingzi, Nanchang, Pingxiang, Yichun, Boyang, Leping, Guangfeng, Ganxian, Nankang, Linchuan, Nancheng, Ruichang, and twelve other counties. There are 331 townships with yields of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu, and 97 townships with yields of 1,000 to 1,500 jin per mu; there are 2,745 cooperatives with yields of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu, 670 cooperatives with yields of 1,000 to 1,500 jin per mu, and one cooperative with yields of 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu. There are 2.45 million mu of high-yield fields in the province with yields of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu, 1.1 million mu of high-yield fields with yields of 1,000 to 3,000 jin, 200 mu with yields of 3,000 to 7,000 jin, and in individual high-yield fields, yields have reached as high as 9,185 jin per mu.

In order to ensure an even greater bumper harvest of late rice, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has decided that the six-level, 100,000-cadre appraisal and inspection team organized in mid-June this year will remain in the rural areas to implement the eight specific measures, strengthen field management, and more widely and deeply implement the appraisal and inspection movement, truly ensuring that they will not withdraw until a complete victory is achieved.

### 早稻频报大面积丰收　湖北省孝感全县平均亩产一千七百多斤  安徽安庆专区产量跃增三倍　江西全省增产八十四亿斤

　　早稻频报大面积丰收
　　湖北省孝感全县平均亩产一千七百多斤
　  安徽安庆专区产量跃增三倍　江西全省增产八十四亿斤
    据新华社武汉10日电　著名全国的“千斤县”——湖北省孝感县，今年早稻大放光彩，全县三十万零二千多亩早稻，经过收打和反复核算，总产量达到了五亿三千多万斤，平均亩产一千七百五十五斤多，比去年早稻亩产六百一十七斤增加了将近两倍。
    中共湖北省委第一书记王任重，书记处书记王延春以及孝感地委和县委第一书记共同指导的二十万亩丰产示范区，其中十万零九千多亩早稻，平均亩产达到了二千三百三十五斤。卧龙、龙店、祝站、肖港、朋兴等区，亩产五千斤、七千斤、八千斤，到处皆是。到目前为止，全县亩产万斤以上的有十六处之多（面积都在一亩以上）其中全国劳动模范、长风社主任官木生和青年突击队合种的一块试验田，亩产达到了一万五千多斤。
    由于大面积丰产和成千成万的高额丰产田的涌现，全县出现了许多高产乡和农业社。据统计，全县平均亩产二千斤到二千八百多斤的有二十八个乡，平均亩产二千斤到三千斤的有三百一十九个社，另外，还有三十个社平均亩产达到了三千斤以上。仅这一季早稻的丰收，孝感县七十一万农业人口每人平均有七百四十六斤粮食，比1955年全年每人平均粮食总量还多。
    孝感县曾经争论过这样一个问题，有不少人认为，这个县地形复杂，土质好坏分布不匀，断定自然条件限制了生产迅速增长。现在的事实怎样呢？无论是平原区、丘陵还是山区，也无论是土质肥沃还是瘦田瘠地，都同样获得了大丰产，而且涌现了大批高额丰产典型。
    孝感县的早稻大丰收，是从不断斗争的道路上走过来的。为了战胜各种形形色色的保守思想，党领导着广大群众开展了大鸣、大放、大辩论，在这期间，全县一共贴出了大字报达二十七万多张。特别是采取了干部搞样板（试验田），然后组织现场参观、辩论，收效极好。这样一来，大大解放了思想，破除了迷信，因而深耕、密植、增施肥料都比往年做得好。今年的田间管理也抓得紧。此外，他们还战胜了六、七十天干旱的严重威胁。
    由于早稻的大丰收，孝感县农民的思想更加解放了，最近，他们正在总结早稻丰产经验，由于丰产不平衡现象还很突出，普遍认为，水稻增产潜力还大得很。因此，人们决定乘胜猛进，争取今年全县平均亩产达到三千斤。
    据新华社合肥10日电　安徽省安庆专区种植的二百五十万亩早稻已基本收割完了，早稻总产量为二十八万二千五百万斤，平均每亩单产为一千一百三十斤。这个总产量比去年全专区早稻总产量增加了三倍。
    今年，各地还创造了许多早稻高额丰产纪录，截至8月4日统计，亩产二千斤以上的有二十一万一千六百五十三亩；亩产三千斤以上的有一万二千二百六十三亩；亩产四千斤以上的有三百一十一亩；亩产五千斤以上的有八十一点九亩；亩产六千斤以上的有十二点八亩；亩产七千斤到九千斤的有十六点二亩；亩产万斤以上的有二点五八亩。
    安庆专区获得大面积丰收的主要原因是：在水稻生产各个环节上都是以政治挂帅，认真地、深入地贯彻党的总路线和省委指示，开展反右倾、反保守思想的斗争，对今年取得丰收有决定意义。
    新华社南昌10日电　到8月上旬，江西省二千四百九十四万亩早稻，已全部收割完毕，总产量达到一百四十三点二亿斤，每亩平均产量五百七十四斤。今年早稻和去年相比，增产八十四点二亿斤，即增产143％。按全省城乡一千八百四十万人口计算，每人平均有粮食七百七十八斤。
    江西省一季早稻超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定亩产八百斤以上的县，有星子、南昌、萍乡、宜春、波阳、乐平、广丰、赣县、南康、临川、南城、瑞昌等十二个县。亩产八百至一千斤的乡有三百三十一个，一千斤至一千五百斤的乡有九十七个；亩产八百至一千斤的社有二千七百四十五个，一千斤至一千五百斤的社六百七十个，一千五百斤至二千斤的社一个。全省亩产八百至一千斤的丰产田有二百四十五万亩，千斤以上三千斤以下的高额丰产田有一百一十万亩，三千斤至七千斤的二百亩，个别的丰产田，亩产竟达九千一百八十五斤。
    为了保证晚稻更大丰收，中共江西省委决定，今年6月中旬组织的省、地、县、区、乡、社六级十万干部评比检查团仍然留在农村工作，贯彻八项具体措施，加强田间管理，更广泛更深入地贯彻开展评比检查运动，真正做到不获全胜，决不收兵。（附图片）
