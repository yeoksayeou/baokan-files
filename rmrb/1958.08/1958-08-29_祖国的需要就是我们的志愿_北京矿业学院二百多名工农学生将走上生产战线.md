The Needs of the Motherland Are Our Aspirations
More Than 200 Worker-Peasant Students from the Beijing Mining Institute Will Embark on the Production Front

    (Our newspaper reports) More than 200 worker-peasant students (including more than 130 coal mine industrial workers) are about to graduate from the Beijing Mining Institute.

    Before liberation, these university students from worker and peasant backgrounds suffered deeply from the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, landlords, and capitalists, and their lives were extremely miserable. The vast majority were illiterate or semi-literate.

    After liberation, their lives underwent fundamental changes. The slaves of the past became the masters of today. The Party and the government gave them great care, sending them to literacy classes, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and finally to the Beijing Mining Institute to study. In just eight years, they have become working-class intellectuals who have mastered both modern coal mining technology and scientific theory.

    In the eight-year study process, they had to complete the sixteen-year curriculum of ordinary schools. This was indeed not an easy task, especially after entering university, the difficulties became even greater. They did not bow to difficulties, but studied diligently and assiduously. In order not to fall behind, they used all their rest time for reviewing. They have been in Beijing for four years, but some students have not even been to the Forbidden City or Beihai Park, because time is more precious to them than leisure. In this way, they finally conquered the fortress of science. The vast majority of worker-peasant students have very good exam results, and some have even scored straight As in all subjects since entering university.

    The graduation designs of this year's graduating students are no longer "armchair strategizing" as in previous years, but are "real swords and guns" for production design. Together with other students, they contracted the production design tasks for nine million tons of mines in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces. In the thirteen design offices and mobile production design teams of the entire institute, except for a few, they all served as heads of the design offices and leaders of the production teams, playing organizational and backbone roles. Whether in design ideas, program discussions, or technological innovations, they reflect their ability to closely integrate theory with practice, solve specific problems, and dare to fight against backward and conservative thinking. For example, in the Zhubi No. 1 Mine Design Office, Zhou Zhidi and Shou Benfu, who were from mining backgrounds, broke the conservative and superstitious regulations stipulated in books and always regarded by teachers as inviolable, that underground power transmission should not exceed 500 meters. In the design process, the distance of underground power transmission far exceeded 500 meters, reaching nearly 1,000 meters. According to the guiding teacher's plan, a set of voltage boosting equipment must be installed above ground, and another set of voltage reducing equipment must be installed underground. Zhou Zhidi and Shou Benfu, who dared to fight against backward and conservative thinking, carefully analyzed the situation and made actual calculations to draw the conclusion that low-voltage power transmission at underground distances exceeding 500 meters was entirely possible. The key issue was that as long as the power transmission cable was properly selected, this new plan was not only technically reasonable, convenient for maintenance and management, and also safe, the biggest feature was that it had significant economic significance. The saved transformers alone were worth more than 20,000 yuan. However, when this plan was proposed, it was immediately opposed by the guiding teacher, who believed that the book did not say so, and the teacher had never said so. However, after the scheme's defense and technical comparison, the guiding teacher finally agreed in the face of the facts.

    In the design process, because the worker-peasant students were familiar with the site conditions, they made full use of local building materials such as blue bricks, adobe, and rubble, saving the country a lot of cement and concrete. The total investment of the design was reduced by 43% compared with the requirements of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry, the cost per ton of coal was reduced by 34%, and the entire mine was handed over to production one and a half months ahead of schedule, saving the country a large amount of initial investment. Therefore, the guiding teachers' comments on them were: "The design results can completely guarantee on-site construction, and the design quality completely meets the requirements of the institute's design office."

    On the eve of graduation, these university students from worker and peasant backgrounds are filled with infinite gratitude and warmth to the Party. When some comrades asked them where they would like to be assigned after graduation, they all answered in unison: "The needs of the motherland are our aspirations."

### 祖国的需要就是我们的志愿  北京矿业学院二百多名工农学生将走上生产战线

　　祖国的需要就是我们的志愿
    北京矿业学院二百多名工农学生将走上生产战线
    本报讯　二百多名工农学生（其中煤矿产业工人一百三十多人）即将从北京矿业学院毕业。
    这批工农出身的大学生在解放前都是深受帝国主义、地主、资本家的残酷压榨与剥削，生活极端痛苦，绝大部分都是处于文盲与半文盲状态。
    解放后他们的生活面貌起了根本的变化，昔日的奴隶成了今天的主人，党和政府给予了他们极大的关怀，将他们送进了识字班、工农速成中学，直到北京矿业学院学习。在短短的八年中，他们已经成为既掌握现代煤矿技术又懂得科学理论的工人阶级知识分子。
    在八年的学习过程中，要学完普通学校中十六年的课程，这确实不是一件容易的事，尤其是进入大学后困难就更加重。他们不向困难低头，勤学苦钻，为了不至于掉队，他们用上了所有休息时间来进行复习。他们在北京四年了，但有的学生甚至连故宫、北海都还未去过，因为时间对他们来说要比游息更为宝贵。这样，他们终于攻下了科学堡垒。绝大多数的工农学生考试成绩都很好，甚至有的从进大学以来各门课程都是五分。
    今年毕业学生的毕业设计已不再像往年那样“纸上谈兵”，而是
  “真刀真枪”进行生产设计。他们与其他学生一道，承包了河北、山东、山西等省九百万吨的矿井生产设计任务。在全院十三个设计室及巡回生产设计队中，除个别的外，他们都担任了设计室室长及生产队长的职务，起着组织与骨干作用。不论在设计思想上、方案探讨上，以及在技术革新上都反映出他们能密切结合实际、解决具体问题，并且敢于向落后保守的思想作斗争。例如在竹壁一矿的设计室里，矿工出身的周志第和寿本富打破了书本上所规定的、教师们一向奉为清规戒律的、在井下送电不能超过五百公尺的保守与迷信。在设计过程中，井下送电的距离远远超过了五百公尺，而达到了将近一千公尺。若按指导教师的方案，必定得在井上装置一套升压设备，井下再装一套降压设备。敢于向落后与保守思想作斗争的周志第与寿本富仔细分析了情况，并进行了实际计算得出了结论，认为井下距离超过五百公尺的低压输电完全可以，关键问题在于只要输电电缆选择适当，这个新的方案不但技术合理，维护管理方便，而且也安全，最大的特点是有着重大的经济意义，单是所省下的变电设备就值二万多元。但是当这方案提出后，当即受到指导老师的反对，认为书上没有这么讲，老师亦没有这么讲过，但是经过方案的答辩、技术比较，在事实面前指导老师终于同意了。
    在设计过程中，工农学生由于对现场情况熟悉，因此充分利用了当地所产的青砖、土坯、料石等建筑材料，给国家节省大量的水泥及混凝土，使设计的总投资比河北省工业厅要求的降低43％，每吨煤的成本降低34％，并使整个矿井提前一个半月移交生产，给国家节省了大量的初期投资，因此指导教师对他们的评语是：“设计成果完全可以保证现场施工，设计质量完全达到了院设计室的要求”。
    在毕业前夕，这批工农出身的大学生，内心中充满了对党的无限感激与温暖，当有些同志问到他们毕业后愿意分配到什么地方，他们都异口同声的回答：“祖国的需要就是我们的志愿”。（雨林、袁怡成）（附图片）
