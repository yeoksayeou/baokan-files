Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Rio de Janeiro: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in the Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro, on August 4th for a two-day official visit. Just like U.S. Vice President Nixon's experience during his visit to Latin American countries this spring, Dulles was greeted by a chorus of "Get Out!" from the Brazilian people upon his arrival.

Despite the Brazilian government's prior deployment of military police to prevent anti-American demonstrations, Dulles's entourage could not escape the people's rebukes. As Dulles's motorcade passed the headquarters of the National Student Union of Brazil, hundreds of Brazilian students waved their fists from the windows and roof of the building, shouting angrily, "Dulles, get out!" The National Student Union building was draped in black gauze, with a banner hanging in the middle that read: "Dulles Go Home!" Huge banners were also hung on the walls on both sides of the building, reading: "America Doesn't Want Friends, Only Interests!" "Dulles Get Lost!" "No (American) Interference in Petrobras!"

As can be seen from reports by American news agencies, Washington officials attach great importance to Dulles's visit, considering it another effort by the U.S. government to win over Latin American countries and prevent the further deterioration of U.S. relations with Latin American countries. It is particularly pointed out that this "deterioration of relations" was centrally manifested in the widespread scorn and condemnation Nixon encountered during his visit to Latin America in April and May of this year.

In his speech at the Rio de Janeiro airport, Dulles said that he would discuss the international situation (including the Middle East issue), relations between American countries, and Brazil's organizational development with Brazilian President Kubitschek and other Brazilian officials.

According to various reports, the issue of relations between countries throughout the American continent will occupy a major position in the talks. Latin American countries demand that the United States consult them and listen to their opinions on major international issues, rather than ordering them to endorse the United States after the fact. In a recent letter to the U.S. President, Brazilian President Kubitschek pointed out the pressure exerted by the United States on the foreign policies of Latin American countries, while emphasizing that Latin America "should break away from the insignificant rearguard position it has occupied so far in international affairs" and let the world "hear the voice of Latin America." However, as can be seen from Dulles's statements before and after arriving in Brazil, the United States intends to try its best to obtain their support for U.S. foreign policy, first and foremost support for U.S. aggressive adventures in the Middle East, at a time when Latin American countries are demanding more independence and more say.

Dulles's remarks in Washington on the eve of his departure also show that the United States intends to do its utmost to obstruct the Latin American countries' movement to strengthen their struggle for independence, and to divert the Latin American people's attention from solving pressing economic and political problems by using the so-called "communist infiltration" rhetoric.

    杜勒斯和尼克松的遭遇一样狼狈
    巴西人民高呼：滚回去！
    新华社5日讯　里约热内卢消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯4日乘飞机到达巴西首都里约热内卢，作两天的正式访问。同今年春天美国副总统尼克松访问拉丁美洲各国时的遭遇一样，杜勒斯到达以后迎头碰到的是巴西人发出的一片“滚回去”的呼声。
    尽管巴西政府事先布置了军警阻止反美示威，杜勒斯一行还是逃脱不了群众的责骂。当杜勒斯一行的车队开过巴西全国学生联合会总部的大楼的时候，几百名巴西学生从这座大楼的窗户里和屋顶上向他挥舞拳头，高声怒喊“杜勒斯，滚回去！”全国学生联合会的大楼披上了黑纱，大楼的中间悬挂着横幅标语：“杜勒斯回家去！”，在大楼两旁的墙上也挂着巨幅标语，上面写着：“美国不要朋友，只要利益！”“杜勒斯滚蛋！”“不许（美国）染指巴西石油公司！”
    从美国通讯社报道中可以看出，华盛顿人士非常重视杜勒斯的这次访问，认为是美国政府拉拢拉丁美洲国家和阻止美国同拉丁美洲各国的关系进一步恶化的又一次努力。人们特别指出，这种“关系的恶化”集中地表现在今年45月间尼克松访问拉丁美洲期间所遭到的广泛的唾骂和斥责上面。
    杜勒斯在里约热内卢机场上发表的谈话中表示，他将同巴西总统库比契克和其他巴西官员讨论国际局势（包括中东问题）、美洲国家间的关系以及巴西的组织发展等问题。
    据各方报道，整个美洲大陆的国家之间的关系问题将在会谈中占主要地位。拉丁美洲国家要求美国在国际重大问题上同它们磋商和听取它们的意见而不是事后命令它们对美国表示赞同。巴西总统库比契克最近在写给美国总统的信中指出美国对拉丁美洲国家外交政策的压力，同时强调指出，拉丁美洲“应该摆脱到目前为止在国际事务中所占的毫不显著的后卫地位”，并且让世界“听到拉丁美洲的声音”。可是从杜勒斯在到达巴西前后发表的谈话中可以看出，美国打算在拉丁美洲国家要求有更多的独立自主和更多的发言权的时候，尽量取得它们对美国外交政策的支持，首先是对美国在中东的侵略冒险的支持。
    杜勒斯启程前夕在华盛顿发表的谈话还表明美国还打算竭力阻挠拉丁美洲国家加强争取独立的运动，并且用所谓“共产主义渗入”的谰言来转移拉丁美洲人民对解决迫切的经济和政治问题的视线。（附图片）
