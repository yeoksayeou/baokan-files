Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 10th: Figures from various investigations show that Japan's economic ailments are worsening.

According to a recent survey by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Japan's industrial and mining production index for the first half of this year decreased by 2.2% compared to the same period last year. This is the largest year-on-year decline since the war. MITI estimates that, given the current development trend of domestic and international economic crises, Japan's industrial and mining production index for fiscal year 1958 will only increase by 0.5%, and the gross national product will only increase by 1%. The Kishi Nobusuke government's economic plan for this fiscal year stipulates that the industrial and mining production index should increase by 4.5% and the gross national product should increase by 3%.

Faced with the already erupted crisis of overproduction, the Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted strict measures to restrict production, even using the method of dispatching officials to factories to supervise production cuts, which is rare in other capitalist countries, in an attempt to alleviate the pressure of overproduction. However, three inventory surveys conducted by MITI show that the Kishi Nobusuke government's prescription cannot eliminate the crisis of overproduction.

According to the third inventory survey conducted in July, under the current scale of production reduction, it will take at least until around November this year for the inventory index to return to normal. For products such as man-made fibers, it will take until March next year to change the situation of excessive inventory. In the first inventory survey conducted in early April, Japanese officials were optimistic that normal inventory levels could be restored by June. The second inventory survey conducted in early June believed that the situation could improve before September. Statistics show that Japan's product inventory began to show signs of surplus in June last year, and the product inventory index at the end of June this year increased by 25.2% compared to the same period last year.

The Ministry of Finance announced the import and export trade figures for July on the 6th. Following a deficit of 4 million US dollars in June, a deficit of more than 22.2 million US dollars appeared in July. Moreover, this deficit occurred under the condition that import trade decreased by nearly 3 million US dollars compared with the previous month. Exports in July were 231.1 million US dollars and imports were 253.3 million US dollars. The Ministry of Finance believes that Japan's international balance of payments situation will be even more tense in the second half of the year. This is because it also has to repay the 115 million US dollar agricultural product loan borrowed by the Bank of Japan from the US Export-Import Bank in August last year.

Under the situation of increasingly deteriorating production, inventory, and exports, the Liberal Democratic Party's "Special Committee on Temporary Fiscal and Economic Affairs" is formulating a plan to stimulate domestic demand and is preparing to submit it to the extraordinary Diet session this autumn. According to the "Japan Economic News," the so-called measures to stimulate domestic demand are nothing more than allocating 80 billion yen for investment in industrial facilities.

Japanese officials admit that, given the failure of this year's economic plan, the number of unemployed will inevitably increase sharply, and companies' savings will also be depleted. This autumn will see an eruption of bankruptcies and mass layoffs.

According to Kyodo News, the Kishi Nobusuke government has ordered the Fair Trade Commission, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Cabinet Secretariat, and other agencies to expedite the drafting of amendments to the Anti-Monopoly Law. The amendment stipulates that the conditions for approving the organization of so-called "industrial rationalization cartels" in the event of economic depression should be greatly relaxed. Some "industrial rationalization cartels" do not even need approval, but only need to be reported. The amendment also stipulates that manufacturer cartels can be combined with sales cartels, and also encourages the organization of cartels for dumping exports, etc.

In this way, Japanese monopoly capital can carry out comprehensive and arbitrary monopolies in terms of production, sales, and even the market. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which have already gone bankrupt on a large scale in the economic crisis, will be further devastated by monopoly enterprises.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's draft amendment to the Anti-Monopoly Law is scheduled to be submitted to the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet scheduled for September.

　　岸信介的药方治不好生产危机症
　　日本经济状况进一步恶化
　　官方承认今秋将爆发厂商倒闭和大量解雇的事件
　　政府企图用摧残中小企业办法为垄断资本谋出路
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：各方面的调查数字说明，日本经济的各种病症愈来愈恶化。
    据日本通商产业省最近调查，今年上半年日本工矿业生产指数比去年同一时期下降了2.2％，在一年间下降幅度这样大，这在战后还是第一次。通商产业省估计，按目前国内外经济危机的发展趋势，1958年度日本的工矿业生产指数只能增加0.5％、生产总值只能增加1％，而岸信介政府本年度的经济计划规定工矿业生产指数要增加4.5％、生产总值要增加3％。
    面对着已经爆发了的生产过剩危机，岸信介政府采取了严格限制生产的措施，甚至使用了在其他资本主义国家内少见的派遣官员到工厂去进行监督减产的办法，企图减轻生产过剩的压力。但是，通商产业省进行的三次库存调查表明，岸信介政府的这副药方并不能消除生产过剩的危机。
    根据7月里进行的第三次库存调查，在继续目前进行的缩减生产的规模的情况下，至少要到今年11月左右才能使库存指数恢复正常，其中如人造纤维品等要到来年3月才能改变库存过剩的情况。而在4月初进行第一次库存调查时，日本官方曾经乐观地认为到6月就可以恢复正常库存指数；6月初进行的第二次库存调查则认为9月以前情况可以好转。据统计，日本的产品库存从去年6月就开始出现过剩的现象，而今年6月底的产品库存指数比去年同期增加了25.2％。
    大藏省在6日发表了7月份进出口贸易额数字，继6月份的四百万美元的赤字之后，7月份又出现了二千二百多万美元的赤字。而且，这次赤字是在进口贸易比上月减少了近三百万美元的情况下产生的。7月份的出口是二亿三千一百万美元，进口为二亿五千三百万美元。大藏省认为，日本下半年的国际收支情况将更加紧张。因为，它还要把去年8月日本银行向美国进出口银行借的一亿一千五百万美元的农产品借款还清。
    在生产、库存、输出等各方面情况日益恶化的形势下，自由民主党的“临时财政经济特别委员会”正在拟定刺激国内需要的方案，并且准备在今年秋季的临时国会上提出。据“日本经济新闻”透露，所谓刺激国内需要的措施，只不过是用八百亿日元的拨款来进行与工业有关的设施投资而已。
    日本官方承认，在今年度经济计划破产的情况下，失业人数必将剧增，企业的积蓄也将坐吃山空，今年秋季将要爆发厂商倒闭和大量解雇的事件。
    据共同社报道，岸信介政府已经命令公正交易委员会、通商产业省、内阁审议室等机关加紧拟订禁止垄断法的修正案草案。这项修正案规定：要大大放宽批准在经济萧条情况下组织所谓“产业合理化卡特尔”的条件，有些“产业合理化卡特尔”则根本不用批准，只要呈报就行。修正案还规定制造商卡特尔可以同销售卡特尔联合在一起，另外还鼓励组织向外倾销的卡特尔等等。
    这样一来，日本垄断资本就可以从生产、销售以至市场等方面全面地任意进行垄断，在经济危机中已经大规模破产的中小企业将进一步遭到垄断企业的摧残。
    岸信介政府的这份禁止垄断法修正案准备向预定于9月间举行的日本国会临时会议提出。
