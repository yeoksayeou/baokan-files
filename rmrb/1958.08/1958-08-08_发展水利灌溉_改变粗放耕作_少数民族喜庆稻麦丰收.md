Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Spring wheat in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, and other places has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and early rice in Guangxi, Yunnan, and other southern provinces has also prospered. Like the rest of the country, all minority areas are now sending news of unprecedented bumper harvests, and minority farmers are jubilant, with songs of celebration flying everywhere.

This year, the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region's more than 11 million mu of spring wheat reached an average yield of 240 jin per mu, breaking the historical high of 200 jin, with a total output of 2.7 billion jin, a sharp increase of 900 million jin compared to last year. This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's 8 million mu of spring wheat yielded 1.6 billion jin, doubling last year's output. The average yield per mu also exceeded the national average yield of winter wheat. In the Ningxia region, where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, almost every commune increased production, and every commune had grain reserves. The vast countryside presented a moving scene of celebrating the harvest. The average yield per mu of the more than one million mu of spring wheat on the Yinchuan Plain jumped to 475 jin. In Qinghai and other places, where the wheat harvest season is later, the prelude to the harvest has also begun, with full wheat grains, and the unit area yield is expected to double last year's.

In the south of the motherland, various minority nationalities waged a sustained and unremitting struggle against droughts unseen in decades. Some places fought drought from early rice planting to harvesting and finally won a good harvest. Now, the good news of early rice bumper harvests in these ethnic minority areas is frequently being reported. The total output of more than 400,000 mu of early rice in ethnic minority areas in southern Yunnan Province increased fivefold compared to last year, and the average yield per mu in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture increased to 886 jin. On the barren mountains in the areas inhabited by the Bouyei, Miao, and Shui ethnic groups in Guizhou, the rice stalks are thick and the ears are long, and a bumper harvest is in sight. In Wangmo County, where harvesting began earlier, high-yield fields with a yield of more than 1,600 jin per mu have appeared. In some high-altitude and cold mountainous areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the rice fields carefully cultivated by ethnic minorities are covered with red flags indicating high yields. Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County, and Mabian County in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province have only begun learning to grow rice in the past year or two. This year is the first time they have planted on a large scale, and the average yield per mu of early rice has reached more than 800 jin.

The rice and wheat harvests in the minority areas were also achieved by overcoming unfavorable natural conditions such as frost, hail, drought, and pests. Since last winter, under the brilliant light of the General Line and together with the Han farmers, the farmers of all ethnic minorities have worked hard throughout the winter and spring, developing water conservancy and irrigation and changing extensive farming, which has brought about significant changes in agricultural production in these areas. The fact that minority areas have achieved bumper harvests of rice and wheat this year shows that although the natural conditions in some minority areas are relatively poor, under the leadership of the Party and in the context of the Great Leap Forward, these areas will rapidly change the historically backward and therefore poorer state of production, and quickly catch up with advanced production levels.

    发展水利灌溉  改变粗放耕作
    少数民族喜庆稻麦丰收
    据新华社7日讯  新疆、内蒙古、宁夏、青海等地春小麦空前丰收，南方广西、云南等省区的早稻也丰收了。和全国一样，现在各少数民族地区都传来了空前大丰收的喜讯，各少数民族的农民都在欢腾鼓舞，到处飞扬着喜庆丰收的歌声。
    新疆维吾尔自治区今年一千一百多万亩春小麦，平均亩产达二百四十斤，冲破了历史上从未达到过的二百斤大关，总产量二十七亿斤，比去年猛增九亿斤。内蒙古自治区今年的八百万亩春小麦，产量达十六亿斤，比去年增长一倍，平均亩产也超过了全国冬小麦平均亩产的数字。回族人民聚居的宁夏地区，几乎是社社增产，社社有了储存粮，广大农村呈现了一片欢庆丰收的动人景象。银川平原上的一百多万亩春小麦，平均亩产跃为四百七十五斤。在麦收季节较晚的青海等地，也揭开了丰收的序幕，小麦颗粒饱满，预计单位面积产量要比去年翻一番。
    在祖国的南方，各少数民族曾经向几十年所未有的旱灾，进行了持久不懈的斗争。有的地方从早稻播种一直抗旱到收割，终于争得了好收成。现在，这些民族地区早稻丰产的捷报频频相传。云南省南部少数民族地区四十多万亩早稻，总产量比去年激增五倍，红河哈尼族彝族自治州平均亩产提高到八百八十六斤。贵州布依、苗、水等族聚居区的贫瘠山地上，水稻秆粗穗长，丰收在望。开镰较早的望漠县，已出现了亩产一千六百多斤的丰产田。在广西僮族自治区的一些高寒山区，少数民族精心经营的稻田，遍插丰产红旗。三江侗族自治县、大苗山苗族自治县和四川省凉山彝族自治州的马边县，都是近一两年来才开始学习种稻，今年第一次大面积种植，而早稻的平均亩产却已达到了八百多斤。
    各少数民族地区的稻麦丰收，同样是克服了霜冻、雹灾、干旱、虫害等不利的自然条件才取得的。去冬以来，各少数民族农民，在总路线的光辉照耀下和汉族农民一起，大干了一冬一春，发展了水利灌溉和改变了粗放耕作，使这些地区的农业生产开始发生了显著的变化。少数民族地区今年稻麦大丰收的事实说明：尽管部分少数民族地区自然条件较差，但是，在党的领导下，在大跃进的形势下，这些地区将迅速改变历史遗留的生产较落后因而较为贫困的面貌，迅速赶上先进的生产水平。（附图片）
