Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Premier Zhou Enlai stated at a reception hosted tonight by Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wijono, in celebration of the 13th anniversary of Indonesian independence, that the Chinese government and the Chinese people will spare no effort to consistently support the Indonesian government and people in their struggle against imperialist aggression and interference, and to safeguard national independence. The Premier firmly believes that the just struggle of the Indonesian people will achieve complete victory.

Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi also attended the reception. In his speech, Premier Zhou said, "Recently, the independence and security of the young Republic of Indonesia have once again been severely threatened. The American aggressor group has carried out a series of intervention activities against Indonesia, from plotting and supporting armed rebellion and conducting military intimidation, to employing all kinds of despicable political conspiracies. However, the awakened Indonesian people cannot be intimidated. As President Sukarno said: 'The Indonesian people love peace, but they love independence even more. If our independence is violated, we will use all means at our disposal to fight the interveners.' The Indonesian government united all patriotic and democratic forces, and with the support of peace-loving countries and people around the world, resolutely fought back against imperialist intervention and quelled the rebellion. The Chinese people express their utmost respect to the heroic Indonesian people, and firmly believe that their just struggle will achieve complete victory."

Premier Zhou said, "The Republic of Indonesia adheres to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and plays an increasingly important role in consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The Indonesian government promptly recognized the Republic of Iraq, explicitly demanded the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan, opposed interference in Iraq's internal affairs, and supported the convening of an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to stop aggression against Middle Eastern countries. All of these fully demonstrate the Indonesian government's solemn position in upholding the Bandung Conference resolutions, safeguarding peace, and respecting the independence and sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries."

Speaking of the current situation in the Middle East, Premier Zhou sternly condemned the conspiracies played by American and British imperialism at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly, and emphasized that such conspiracies will never succeed.

Premier Zhou concluded by stating that the Chinese government and people "are willing to work to further strengthen the mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in economic construction and the cause of safeguarding international peace."

Prior to Premier Zhou's speech, Ambassador Wijono stated in his speech: "Thirteen years ago today, the Indonesian people declared their independence. This independence was not a gift from any country, but entirely the result of the people's revolution. This independence was won by the people through their own efforts, bloodshed, and sacrifice."

The Ambassador said, "Until now, the Indonesian people are still engaged in arduous struggle. There are still many evil forces attempting to undermine our independence. But the entire nation has vowed to continue the struggle until it wins complete victory and realizes its ideals. That ideal is to establish a just and prosperous independent Indonesia."

"National independence is a universal ideal of all countries. Therefore, mutual respect for national independence is a prerequisite for maintaining genuine world peace."

"Precisely for this reason, Indonesia wholeheartedly supports the development of West Asian Arab nationalism in its struggle for complete and genuine independence."

The Ambassador concluded his speech by pointing out, "I am very pleased that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia are following a common approach in their efforts to maintain world peace. This is because both of our countries sincerely uphold the principles of the Bandung Conference."

Tonight, the Ambassador also invited people from all sectors of China and foreign envoys to China to attend his reception.

　　庆祝印度尼西亚独立十三周年
　　维约普拉诺托大使举行招待会
    新华社17日讯　周恩来总理今晚在印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托举行的招待会上说，中国政府和中国人民将尽一切力量始终不渝地支持印度尼西亚政府和人民维护民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争。总理深信，印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争必将获得完全的胜利。
    这个招待会是大使为庆祝印度尼西亚独立十三周年而举行的。彭真副委员长和陈毅副总理兼外交部长也出席了招待会。周总理在讲话中说：“最近一个时期，年青的印度尼西亚共和国的独立和安全再一次遭到了严重的威胁。美国侵略集团对印度尼西亚进行了一系列的干涉活动。从策动和支持武装叛乱、进行军事恫吓，到施展种种卑鄙的政治阴谋。但是，觉醒了的印度尼西亚人民是恫吓不了的。正如苏加诺总统所说的：‘印度尼西亚人民爱和平，但是更爱独立。如果我们的独立遭到侵犯，我们将利用能够利用的一切手段来同干涉者作战’。印度尼西亚政府团结了一切爱国民主力量，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，坚决地反击了帝国主义的干涉，平定了叛乱。中国人民对英勇的印度尼西亚人民表示极大的敬意，并且深信，他们的正义斗争必将获得完全的胜利。”
    周总理说：“印度尼西亚共和国坚持执行独立自主和和平的外交政策，对于巩固亚洲和世界的和平起着日益重大的作用。印度尼西亚政府及时地承认伊拉克共和国，明确地要求外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，反对干涉伊拉克的内政和赞成召开联合国大会紧急特别会议以制止对中近东国家的侵略。所有这些都充分地显示了印度尼西亚政府维护万隆会议决议、保卫和平、尊重中近东国家独立和主权的严正立场。”
    谈到目前中近东局势的时候，周总理严厉谴责了美英帝国主义在联大紧急特别会议上玩弄的阴谋，强调指出这种阴谋绝不会得逞。
    周总理最后表示，中国政府和人民“愿意为进一步加强两国在经济建设和维护国际和平事业中的互助合作关系而努力”。
    在周总理讲话之前，维约普拉诺托大使在讲话中说：“十三年前的今天，印度尼西亚人民宣布了自己的独立。这个独立不是任何国家的恩赐，它完完全全是人民革命的成果。这个独立是人民凭自己的努力经过流血牺牲而赢得的。”
    大使说：“直到现在，印度尼西亚人民仍然在进行着艰苦的斗争。现在还有许多邪恶的势力企图破坏我们的独立。但是整个民族已经发誓要继续斗争，直到赢得完全的胜利和实现他们的理想为止。这个理想就是建立一个正义和繁荣的独立的印度尼西亚。”
    “民族独立是世界各国普遍的理想。因此，互相尊重民族独立乃是维护真正的世界和平的先决条件。”
    “正因为如此，印度尼西亚全心全意地支持争取完全和真正独立的西亚阿拉伯民族主义的发展。”
    大使在结束他的讲话时指出：“我感到非常高兴，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国在维护世界和平的努力中遵循着共同的方针。这是因为我们两国都真诚地拥护万隆会议的原则。”
    今晚，大使还邀请了中国各方面的人士和各国驻华使节出席了他的招待会。
