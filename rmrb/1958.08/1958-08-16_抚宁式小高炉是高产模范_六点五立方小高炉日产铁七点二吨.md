　　Funing-style Small Blast Furnace is a High-Yield Model
　　6.5 Cubic Meter Small Blast Furnace Produces 7.2 Tons of Iron Per Day
    According to a report from the Hebei Daily, employees of the Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant in Funing County, Hebei Province, the creators of the Funing-style small blast furnace, recently achieved the miracle of producing 7.2 tons of gray pig iron per day. This figure exceeds the designed capacity of the furnace by 0.7 tons, raising the high-yield red flag for 6.5 cubic meter small blast furnaces and becoming a high-yield furnace in Hebei Province.
    The first small blast furnace in Duzhuang, designated as "Funing-style Small Blast Furnace," has maintained a daily output of around four tons since it was put into production.
    In late July, after the Provincial Party Committee called for vigorously developing the iron and steel industry, the factory leadership conveyed the current severe shortage of steel supply in the province to all employees, and the workers unleashed their enthusiasm. The leadership and the workers conducted a self-criticism ideologically and found that many people did not have a clear understanding of producing more iron and had not ideologically established the idea of creating a high-yield furnace. Everyone proposed "to have a double leap forward in furnace construction and production." They immediately established a core research group with the participation of veteran workers, technicians, and leading cadres to specifically study how to improve the output of the small blast furnace. Then, they immediately took action. The workers put forward the battle cry of "Be a hero in building furnaces, be a pioneer in producing iron," and construction workers and iron smelting workers launched a competition for a double leap forward in furnace construction and production. The Party Branch Secretary, the factory director, and technicians, etc., grasped both furnace construction and output, going to the furnace side to check production conditions and problems with the workers. The research group held a meeting every day to study the problems and workers' opinions found during the inspection one by one, analyzing the reasons for the problems, and then proposing measures for testing. This process of finding reasons and experimenting was repeated again and again. Finally, based on the production conditions of the small blast furnace, they increased the air volume, raised the air temperature, and removed impurities from the ore. Worker Zheng Zhirong exploited the potential of the locomobile boiler to allow the blower to deliver more air. Deputy team leader Cheng Jinbao constantly checked the iron melting situation inside the small blast furnace. Once a problem was found, he immediately contacted the workers responsible for air supply, charging, and water supply to find ways to improve operations and ensure normal iron melting. The furnace workers also established a registration form to find reasons from the daily output, etc. With these measures, the iron production of the small blast furnace quickly increased from four and a half tons and five tons to 7.2 tons per day, becoming an unprecedented high-yield furnace in the province.

　　抚宁式小高炉是高产模范
　　六点五立方小高炉日产铁七点二吨
    据河北日报消息　创建抚宁式小高炉的河北省抚宁县杜庄炼铁厂职工，最近创造了日产灰生铁七点二吨的奇迹。这个数字，超过了该炉设计能力的零点七吨，插起了六点五立方公尺小高炉的高产红旗。成为河北省的高产炉。
    定名为“抚宁式小高炉”的杜庄第一座小高炉，自投入生产以来，日产量一直在四吨左右。
    7月下旬，省委提出大搞钢铁以后，这个厂的领导上把全省当前钢铁供应严重不足的形势传达给了全体职工，工人们发挥了积极性。领导和工人一起从思想上进行了检查，发现不少人对多出铁的观念不够明确，没有从思想上确立创造高产炉的思想。大家提出“要来一个建炉、生产双跃进”。他们马上成立了有老工人、技术员、领导干部参加的核心研究小组，专门研究如何提高小高炉的产量。接着，他们就立刻行动了起来。工人们提出“建炉当英雄，出铁作先锋”的战斗口号，建筑工人和炼铁工人开展了建炉、生产双跃进的比赛。党支部书记、厂长和技术员等，一手抓建炉，一手抓产量，到炉旁去和工人一起检查生产情况和问题。研究小组每天召开一次碰头会，根据检查出来的问题和工人的意见，逐个地进行排队研究，发现了问题，就分析原因，然后提出措施，进行试验，这样一次又一次地找原因、作试验，最后根据小高炉的生产情况，增加了风量，提高了风温，清除了矿石中的杂物。工人郑志荣发挥了锅驼机的潜力，使鼓风机送进了更多的风量。代班组长程金宝随时检查小高炉内化铁情况，一旦发现有毛病，就马上与送风、上料、供水的工人联系，设法改进操作，保证正常化铁。炉前工人还建立了登记表，从每天的产量多少中找原因等。有了这样一些措施，小高炉的产铁量很快由四吨半、五吨，提高到日产七点二吨，成了全省未有的高产炉。（附图片）
