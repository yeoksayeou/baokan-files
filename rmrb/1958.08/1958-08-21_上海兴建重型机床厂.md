Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 19th: The Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant broke ground on the 18th. After the plant is fully completed next year, it will be able to produce tens of thousands of tons of heavy and super-heavy high-grade precision machine tool equipment annually, equipping newly built large-scale machinery factories throughout the country.

The design of this plant is based on the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant. The total investment of the project is half that of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, but the production capacity greatly exceeds that of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant.

During construction, this plant will adopt the approach of simultaneous construction, installation, and production. It is estimated that the first phase of the project will be completed and put into production in November this year.

　　上海兴建重型机床厂
    新华社上海19日电  上海重型机床厂在18日开工兴建。这个厂明年全部建成以后，每年将可生产几万吨重型和超重型的高级精密机床设备，装备各地新建的大型机械工厂。
    这个厂的设计是参照武汉重型机床厂进行的。整个工程的投资比武汉重型机床厂少一半，而生产能力却大大超过武汉重型机床厂。
    在施工中，这个厂将采取边施工、边安装、边生产的做法，预计第一期工程在今年11月份就可完工，并投入生产。
