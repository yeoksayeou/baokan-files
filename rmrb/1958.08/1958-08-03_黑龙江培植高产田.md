Xinhua News Agency report: A movement to cultivate high-yield fields and strive for first place in production has been widely launched in rural Heilongjiang Province. In Wuchang County, twelve townships and forty agricultural cooperatives have already engaged in a production increase competition to win the title of “Satellite.” In Shuangcheng County, all two hundred and fifty-five cooperatives have launched activities to cultivate "satellite" fields, including the "March 8th Satellite Field" cultivated by women, the "Pioneer Satellite Field" of the youth, and the "Young Pioneer Satellite Field" of elementary school teachers.

In the activity of cultivating high-yield fields, rural areas have adopted many production increase measures. This autumn, Shuangcheng County applied an average of more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. The hundreds of thousands of mu of high-yield “satellite” fields now being cultivated will receive an additional 30,000 jin of good fertilizer per mu, watered every three to five days, and efforts are being made to ensure that all farmland meets these requirements.

In Baoshan Township, Suihua County, the high-yield "satellite" fields showed results in just five days after processing and cultivation. The crops in the "satellite" fields were more outstanding than ordinary crops, dispelling the idea held by a few people that "no matter how much effort is made, it won't have much effect," and motivating everyone in the township to take measures to strive for first place in production.

    黑龙江培植高产田
    据新华社讯　培植高额丰产田，力争产量第一的运动，已在黑龙江省农村广泛展开。五常县已有十二个乡，四十个农业社投入夺取“卫星”称号的增产竞赛。双城县二百五十五个社都开展了培养“卫星”田的活动，其中有妇女培育的“三八号卫星田”，青年的“先锋号卫星田”和小学教师的“红领巾卫星田”。
    在培育高额丰产田的活动中，农村采取了许多增产措施。双城县今年秋天平均每亩施底粪一万多斤，现在培育的几十万亩高产“卫星”田，每亩要再追三万斤好肥料，三天到五天浇一次水，而且力争全部农田都达到这个措施要求。
    绥化县宝山乡的高产“卫星”田经过加工培育，五天之间就看出效果，“卫星”田的庄稼比一般庄稼更出色，破除了少数人“再干也不起多大作用”的想法，带动全乡人人都采取措施，力争产量第一。
