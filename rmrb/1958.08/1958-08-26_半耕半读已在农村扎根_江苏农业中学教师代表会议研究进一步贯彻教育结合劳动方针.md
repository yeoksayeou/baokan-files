Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 25th: At the Jiangsu Province Agricultural Middle School Teacher Representatives' Meeting, currently being held with the participation of over two thousand teacher representatives, the teachers freely discussed their experiences in teaching practice. When the agricultural middle schools were first established, many teachers said that agricultural middle schools were not formal, that there was no future in being an agricultural middle school teacher, and held an attitude of doing just enough to get by. Many parents and students also said that agricultural middle schools were "opening in the spring and closing in the autumn," "wouldn't last long," and "couldn't learn anything." Those with bourgeois educational viewpoints looked down on agricultural middle schools even more. However, the newly established agricultural middle schools of the past half year are like the morning sun, shining brightly, and many people's thinking has changed. Everyone feels that this kind of half-work half-teaching, half-work half-study school is well-run. Many teachers who were not content with teaching in agricultural middle schools have, over the past half year, transformed their thinking through labor and teaching, and from contact with the working people, and feel that being an agricultural middle school teacher is an unparalleled honor. Many have expressed their desire to dedicate themselves to agricultural middle schools for life.

In discussions, the teachers unanimously believed that the quality of students cultivated by agricultural middle schools is high. Now, all the students love labor, and many have become production vanguards and shock team experts, receiving praise from the peasants. Many students who did not like labor in the past, seeing that the teachers were also half-work half-teaching, under the leadership of the teachers and classmates, actively participated in labor and did a good job. For example, Dai Yu娟, a student from Yonggan Township Agricultural Middle School in ? County, was spoiled at home and never participated in labor. The masses called her a "good-for-nothing." After she recognized the importance of labor in agricultural middle school, in just three or four months, she studied well and labored well, already earning more than five hundred work points, becoming a person who loves labor, and was praised by the masses. According to a survey of nineteen students from the first Agricultural Middle School in Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County, before entering the school, they averaged eighty work points of labor per day, which increased to ninety-three work points after entering the school. Many teachers who had never participated in labor before became labor experts after teaching in agricultural middle schools while working.

The teachers also mentioned that the academic performance of agricultural middle school students is also very good. Because education is combined with productive labor, students grasp knowledge particularly firmly, and answer questions very comprehensively in the classroom. A recent inspection of the academic performance of two hundred and forty-eight students from seven agricultural middle schools in Situan Township, Fengxian County, showed that the overall average score for each subject was 93.7 for politics, 84.5 for Chinese, 84 for arithmetic, and 90 for agricultural knowledge. Many agricultural middle schools have planted high-yield experimental fields for wheat and rice, and the masses said after seeing them: "Even hiring foreign professors couldn't teach such results."

Agricultural middle school students not only labor well and study well, but also actively participate in social activities. They have become an important force in rural areas in the propaganda of the general line, the four pests elimination and hygiene campaign, literacy work, and mass cultural activities. Students are good learners in school, combatants in production, technicians in the promotion of new technologies, and propagandists in various movements. They are skilled in both writing and martial arts, and are both workers and farmers. The masses support them with both hands and praise them endlessly, saying: "The Communist Party has good policies, agricultural middle schools are established at our doorstep, and half-work half-study produces new people," "Agricultural middle schools, agricultural middle schools, are versatile, entering agricultural middle schools, both culture and labor are red." Now farmers are increasingly enthusiastic about running such schools.

In the discussion, the teachers also mentioned that agricultural middle schools have also brought benefits to the current industrial and agricultural production and have promoted various tasks. Many schools are now participating in the technical innovation movement centered on agricultural tool reform in their local areas, and many agricultural middle schools are engaged in large-scale experimental fields and high-yield experimental fields, and are running factories on a large scale. According to incomplete statistics from the province, agricultural middle schools have a total of 38,844 mu of high-yield experimental fields and 12,440 small factories. Most of these factories serve agricultural production.

Currently, there are more than 6,500 agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province, with 340,000 students. These schools have absorbed two-thirds of the primary school graduates in the province who have not entered school. At the same time, since the red flag of agricultural middle schools was raised, it has broken superstitions, liberated thinking, and driven the overall leap forward in education in the province. It has rapidly popularized primary school education and promoted literacy work. Now, the red flag of agricultural middle schools clearly demonstrates its superiority and embodies the correctness of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

The teachers participating in the meeting will continue to widely exchange teaching experiences to create more favorable conditions for the continued development, consolidation, and improvement of agricultural middle schools in the second half of the year. (Attached picture)

　　半耕半读已在农村扎根
    江苏农业中学教师代表会议研究进一步贯彻教育结合劳动方针
    据新华社南京25日电　江苏省二千多名教师代表在正在举行的农业中学教师代表会议上，教师们畅谈了他们在教学实践中的体会。在农业中学开办时，有很多教师说农业中学不正规，做农业中学教师没出息，抱着做一天和尚撞一天钟的态度，不少家长和学生也说农业中学是“春开学秋关门”、“办不长”、“学不到东西”，有资产阶级教育观点的人更是瞧不起农业中学。但是，半年来新办起来的农业中学，好像早晨的太阳，光芒万丈，很多人的思想都转变了。大家觉得这种半耕半教、半耕半读的学校就是办得好。很多不安心农中教学的教师，半年来通过一面劳动、一面教学，从同劳动人民的接触中改造了自己的思想，也感到做一个农业中学教师是无尚的光荣，很多人都表示要终身献身于农业中学。
    教师们讨论中一致认为农业中学培养学生的质量是高的。现在学生们个个都热爱劳动，很多学生成为生产上的尖兵和突击队的能手，受到了农民的好评。很多过去不爱劳动的学生，看到教师也是半耕半教，在教师和同学的带领下，也都积极参加了劳动，而且劳动得很好。如?县勇敢乡农业中学学生戴玉娟，过去在家娇生惯养，从不参加劳动，群众称她为“二流子”。她在农业中学认清了劳动的重要意义后，仅三、四个月时间，学习很好，劳动很好，已经做了五百多个工分，变成了一个热爱劳动的人，受到了群众的赞扬。根据邗江县施桥乡第一农业中学十九个学生的调查，他们在未入学前平均每天劳动八十个工分，入学后上升到九十三个工分。很多从来未参加过劳动的教师到了农中边耕边教后也变成了劳动能手。
    教师们谈到农业中学学生的学习成绩也都很好。由于教育和生产劳动相结合，学生学习的知识掌握得特别牢固，在课堂上解答问题很全面。奉贤县四团乡最近对七所农业中学二百四十八个学生成绩的检查，各科成绩总平均是政治九十三点七分、语文八十四点五分，算术八十四分、农业知识九十分。很多农业中学种了小麦、水稻高额丰产试验田，群众看了都说：“请了洋教授也教不出这样的成绩来”。
    农业中学的学生不仅劳动好学习好，还积极参加了社会活动，他们在总路线的宣传、除四害讲卫生运动、扫盲工作和群众文化活动等方面，成了农村中一支重要的力量。学生们在学校里是好学员，在生产上是战斗员，在推广新技术上是技术员，在各项运动中是宣传员，能文能武亦工亦农。群众都双手拥护，赞不绝口地说：“共产党，好章程，农业中学办上门，半耕半读出新人”，“农中，农中，文武皆通，进了农中，文化劳动两头红”。现在农民越来越热心地开办这种学校。
    在讨论中教师们还谈到了农业中学对当前的工农业生产也带来了好处，对各项工作都起了促进作用。现在许多学校正在参加当地以农具改革为中心的技术革新运动，许多农业中学大搞试验田和高额丰产试验田，大办工厂。据全省不完全统计，农业中学种有高额丰产试验田共有三万八千八百四十四亩，办小型工厂一万二千四百四十个。这些厂大部分是为农业生产服务的。
    现在，江苏省农业中学共有六千五百多所，学生三十四万人。这些学校使全省没有入学的高小毕业生有三分之二被吸收入学了。同时，从农业中学这面红旗竖起以后，破除了迷信，解放了思想，带动了全省教育事业的全面跃进。迅速普及了小学教育，推动了扫盲工作。现在农业中学这一面红旗鲜明地显示了它的优越性，体现了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的正确性。
    参加会议的教师还将继续广泛地交流教学经验，为下半年继续发展和巩固提高农业中学，创造更有利的条件。（附图片）
