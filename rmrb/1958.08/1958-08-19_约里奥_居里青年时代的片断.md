Fragments of Joliot-Curie's Youth
　　Bijing

　　In the early spring morning of 1925, a young man walked into the reception room in front of Madame Curie's laboratory.
　　The laboratory assistant told him that Madame Curie had not yet arrived, and only her daughter Irène was working.
　　"Then please inform Miss," the guest replied. "My name is Frédéric Joliot."
　　The assistant asked the guest to wait a moment and went into the laboratory himself.
　　"Mr. Frédéric Joliot is visiting," he said in a low voice, looking at Irène Curie with a questioning expression.
　　"Please come in," the young woman replied.
　　Thus, the two physicists stood face to face, just like Pierre Curie and Maria Skłodowska many years ago.
　　Frédéric Joliot spoke very frankly about his family situation. He was the youngest of seven siblings. His father was already fifty-seven years old when he was born, and was from Lorraine, while his mother was from Alsace. After graduating from public high school, he attended a school named after Lavoisier, the founder of modern chemistry, for a period. Later, he entered the School of Physics. There was a physics teacher named Paul Langevin in this school, who was the role model he aspired to learn from.
　　"The war disrupted my studies," Joliot continued. "In 1918, I was drafted into the army. After the armistice, I continued my studies. For the past few months, I have been working as an intern engineer at the Arbed factory in Esch, Luxembourg...living with the workers. There were Germans, Belgians, and French people there, and many talked about how difficult their families' lives were, and how they, like any living thing, longed to live in a place where the sun shines. From this, I saw that we still have to do many, even very many things, to truly enable everyone to live a human life...
　　"Recently, I could have gone to the metallurgical industry department to be an engineer, but my old physics teacher Langevin advised me not to go, and asked Madame Curie to take me in as an assistant in your laboratory. He told me yesterday that he had obtained the Madam's consent, and I am indescribably happy."
　　The door opened gently, and Marie Curie walked in. The slender body of this white-haired old woman was sturdy and brisk, her movements were agile, and she looked very young. She turned to face the guest who greeted her respectfully.
　　"Our mutual friend Langevin often talks about your talent, Mr. Joliot," she said in a gentle and compassionate tone. "He believes that your dedication to research can make great contributions to mankind, but if you work in industry, you may not be able to fully develop your creative talents. I am very happy that you are coming to work with us, and I wish you success in scientific research."
　　From then on, this twenty-five-year-old young man, Joliot, stayed in Madame Curie's laboratory as an assistant. After finishing his work every day, he re-studied theory to make up for the doctoral degree examination that he had not yet completed. This was done in a very short period of time, which can not only prove his talent, but also sufficiently shows the extraordinary diligence and amazing perseverance of this young physicist.
　　Frédéric and Irène quickly found themselves in mutual agreement. They had the same interest in science, worked in the same laboratory, both liked literature and art, both loved sports, and finally had the common desire to contribute to mankind and mutual love and affection, which quickly connected the lives of the two young scientists. This happened in October 1926, and from then on, the names of these two young scientists were also linked together.

　　约里奥——居里青年时代的片断
　　比金
    1925年初春的一个清晨，一个青年走进了女科学家居里夫人的实验室前面的接待室。
    实验室的助手告诉他，居里夫人还没有到，只有她的女儿伊伦在工作。
    “那就烦你向小姐通报一声，”客人回答说。“我的名字叫弗雷德里克·约里奥”。
    那个助手招呼客人稍等一会儿，自己走进了实验室。
    “弗雷德里克·约里奥先生来拜访”，他用不很高的声音说，带着问话的神情望着伊伦·居里。
    “请进来吧。”这位青年姑娘回答说。
    于是这两位物理学家面对面地站着，正像多少年前的皮埃尔·居里和玛丽娅·斯克洛道夫斯卡。
    弗雷德里克·约里奥很坦率地讲起他的家庭状况。他是兄弟姊妹七人中最小的一个。父亲在他出生时就已经有五十七岁了，是洛林地方人，母亲却是亚尔萨斯人。他在公立中学毕业后，有一个时期进了一个以近代化学奠基人拉瓦锡命名的学校。随后进了物理学校。在这个学校里有一个名叫保尔·郎之万的物理教师，是他立志要学习的榜样。
    “战争打乱了我的求学计划，”约里奥继续说。“1918年我应征入伍。停战以后我才又继续学习。最近这几个月，我在卢森堡埃适地方的阿尔贝德工厂当实习工程师……和工人住在一起。那里有德国人、比利时人和法国人，许多人都谈到他们家属的生活多么困苦，他们跟任何一种生物一样，渴望生活在阳光照耀的地方。从这里我看到，我们还要做许多甚至非常多的事情，才能使大家真正过一种像人样的生活……。
    “最近我本可以去冶金工业部门当工程师了，但是我的老物理教师郎之万却劝我不要去，并且替我请求居里夫人收留我在你们的实验室里当助手。他昨天告诉我，已经得到了夫人的同意，我真是说不出的高兴。”
    门轻轻地开了，玛丽·居里走了进来。这位白发老太太的纤瘦的身体是硬朗的、轻快的，动作灵活，看起来还很年青。她转过脸来对着这位很恭敬地向她打招呼的客人。
    “我们大家的朋友郎之万常常谈起你的天赋，约里奥先生，”她用一种温和的、富于同情的口吻说。“他认为，你的钻研精神可以对人类做出很大贡献，但是你如果在工业方面工作，却未必能完全发挥你的创造性的才能。——你来跟我们合作，我觉得很高兴，我预祝你在科学研究上获得成功。”
    从此，这个二十五岁的青年约里奥就留在居里夫人的实验室里当助手。他每天做完工作以后，重新研究理论，要补上他还没有完成的博士学位考试。这件事在很短期间内就做到了，这不但可以证明他的天资，同时也足以表明这位年轻的物理学家的异常勤奋和值得惊异的毅力。
    弗雷德里克和伊伦很快就相处得彼此情投意合了。对于科学的兴趣是相同的，又同在一个实验室里工作，两人都喜欢文学和艺术，也都爱好运动，最后还有对人类作出贡献的共同的志愿和相互的爱悦，这就很快地把两人的生活连结在一起。这是1926年10月里的事情，从这时起这两位青年科学家的名字也连结在一起了。
