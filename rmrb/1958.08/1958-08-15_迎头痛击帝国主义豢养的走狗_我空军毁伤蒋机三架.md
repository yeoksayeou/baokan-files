Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 14th - The Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shot down and damaged three U.S.-made Chiang planes that intruded into the mainland today.

At 10:21 AM, two batches of U.S.-made Chiang planes, totaling 26 sorties, intruded into the coastal areas of Fujian, with one batch of twelve F86 jet fighters intruding into the airspace over Fuzhou and other areas. This was a large-scale provocation instigated by the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the direction of U.S. imperialism, aimed at creating tension in the southeastern coastal areas. At 10:39 AM, our planes encountered the Chiang planes. After two minutes of fierce fighting, our heroic "War Eagles" shot down two Chiang planes and damaged one. One of the downed Chiang planes crashed outside the mouth of the Minjiang River, and the other plunged into the sea west of Taiwan. The remaining Chiang planes fled in a panic towards Taiwan.

　　迎头痛击帝国主义豢养的走狗
　　我空军毁伤蒋机三架
    新华社福建前线14日电　中国人民解放军空军部队今天一举击落击伤窜扰大陆的美制蒋机三架。
    上午十时二十一分，美制蒋机两批二十六架次窜扰我福建沿海地区，其中一批十二架F86型喷气机，窜入我福州等地上空。这是最近一个时期蒋介石集团在美帝国主义指使下在我东南沿海地区制造紧张局势而进行的一次较大规模的挑衅。十时三十九分，我机与蒋机遭遇。经两分钟激战，我英勇的“战鹰”，击落蒋机两架，击伤蒋机一架。被击落的蒋机，一架坠落在闽江口外，一架栽入台湾以西的大海里。其余蒋机狼狈向台湾方向逃去。
