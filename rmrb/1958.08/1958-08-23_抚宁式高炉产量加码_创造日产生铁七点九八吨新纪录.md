Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 22nd: The No. 2 6.5-cubic-meter small blast furnace at the Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant in Funing County, Hebei Province, created a new high-yield record of 7.98 tons of gray pig iron per day on the 16th, surpassing the high-yield record of 7.2 tons per day of the plant's No. 1 small blast furnace.

The No. 2 small blast furnace of this plant is built with carbonaceous tamping material, and the original hot blast stove was not designed reasonably enough, resulting in lower output. After the No. 1 furnace created a high-yield record of 7.2 tons per day, the workers of the No. 2 furnace learned and promoted the experience of the No. 1 furnace, while leading cadres, workers, and technicians worked together to find ways to increase output from various aspects. Originally, the air volume was small and the temperature was low, so they increased the speed of the blower, so that the hot air temperature quickly rose from 400 degrees in the past to 580 degrees. The workers also improved the charging method, increased the number of charging times, and improved the management of raw materials, shortening the smelting time from four hours per furnace to three hours per furnace. The output on the 13th increased from more than three tons in the past to 7.5 tons. On this basis, the workers continued to improve the operating methods, and created a new record of 7.98 tons on the 16th.

　　抚宁式高炉产量加码
    创造日产生铁七点九八吨新纪录
    本报天津22日电　河北省抚宁县杜庄炼铁厂二号六点五立方公尺小高炉，在16日创造了日产灰生铁七点九八吨的高产新纪录，超过了这个厂一号小高炉日产七点二吨的高产纪录。
    这个厂的二号小高炉是用炭素捣固材料建成的，原来暖风室设计得不够合理，产量较低。在一号炉创造了日产七点二吨的高产纪录以后，二号炉的职工一方面学习和推行一号炉的经验，一方面由领导干部、工人和技术人员一起从多方面寻找提高产量的办法。原来风量小，温度低，他们就加大鼓风机的转速，使热风温度由过去的四百度很快上升到五百八十度。工人们还改进了装料方法，增加了装料次数，改进了对原料的管理，使冶炼时间由原来四小时出一炉缩短到三小时出一炉。13日的产量由过去的三吨多提高到七点五吨；在这一基础上，职工们又继续改进了操作方法，16日创造了七点九八吨的新纪录。
