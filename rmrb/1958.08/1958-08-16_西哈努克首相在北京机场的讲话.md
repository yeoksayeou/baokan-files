Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The full text of Premier Sihanouk's speech at Beijing Airport is as follows:
	Your Excellency Premier, Ladies and Gentlemen:
	More than two years ago, I first set foot on Chinese soil. Today, you have once again expressed a warm welcome to my country through your grand reception for me. I cannot fully express my feelings. Please allow me to tell you how happy I am to see your great country and peaceful and friendly people again, to see your great politicians, and to see your beautiful capital, which is the core of your admirable civilization and has become one of the great political and cultural centers of the modern world in nine years. I am equally happy to have the opportunity to see the achievements you have made in the tremendous efforts that have shocked the world in the past two years.
	The visit of the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia to China marks a decisive stage in the development of relations between our two countries and peoples. Since our two countries regained national independence, the relations between our two countries have been continuously improving and strengthening, and today can be truly called brotherly relations.
	The relationship between Cambodia and China is indeed a long one. As early as when Cambodia was named Funan, that is, about fifteen centuries ago, our two countries had frequent and close contacts, and it should be emphasized that our contacts have always been based on friendship and the hope of mutual understanding, and later developed into spiritual and trade contacts, and there has never been any interference in internal affairs. Unfortunately, historical changes interrupted this connection, which was beneficial to both countries, for nearly a century. Today, just like two friends reunited after a long separation, Cambodia and China have restored their traditional ties.
	Since the meeting in Bandung in 1955, it is understandable that we have coordinated our views, viewpoints and wishes extremely smoothly. I greatly admire the leaders of New China, especially Mr. Zhou Enlai, who is very familiar to Cambodia, for his magnanimous attitude and full understanding of Cambodia's situation; I greatly admire the policies adopted by the leaders of New China and the polite and correct treatment of us. I am deeply convinced that our small country can coexist with its powerful neighbors with confidence and cooperate harmoniously and fraternally on the road to peace and common prosperity.
	I would like to pay tribute to the government of the People's Republic of China. Under the admirable leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the government of the People's Republic of China scrupulously observes the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in its relations with us. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude on behalf of the Cambodian people to the Chinese people for the flexible and unconditional assistance they have provided. This assistance has proven beneficial to us in achieving our task of raising the living standards of our people.
	Thanks to your courage and boldness, you have accomplished peaceful achievements in a few years that are perhaps unique in the history of all countries. The whole of Cambodia knows your achievements and expresses sincere admiration to you. Our small country was originally behind the modernized countries in the world about ten years ago, and today, although we have made progress, we are still behind. However, thanks to the unity of our people, thanks to the peaceful will of our people in maintaining honor and dignity, thanks to the example of China's revival, our people have achieved and will continue to achieve satisfactory progress, allowing us to look forward to the future with confidence.
	Finally, on behalf of the Cambodian people, I would like to extend my fraternal and sincere respect to the Chinese people, and wish that the friendship between our two countries will become the purest model of peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems and common aspirations for peace and progress.

　　西哈努克首相在北京机场的讲话
    新华社15日讯　西哈努克首相在北京机场上的讲话全文如下：总理阁下，女士们，先生们：
    在两年多以前，我第一次踏上中国的土地。今天，你们再次通过对我的隆重接待而表达了对我国的热烈欢迎，我无法充分表达我的感动。请允许我告诉你们，我重新看到你们伟大的国家和和平的与友好的人民，重新看到你们的伟大的政治家们以及作为令人敬慕的贵国文明的核心并在九年内已成为现代世界的伟大政治、文化中心之一的你们的美丽首都，是多么的高兴。我有机会观看你们在最近两年以来的震惊世界的巨大努力所获得的成就，也同样感到高兴。
    柬埔寨王国国家代表团来访问中国，标志我们两国和两国人民之间关系的发展中的决定性阶段。自从我们两国重新获得民族独立，两国之间的关系就不断改善和加强，今天可以名副其实地称为是兄弟般的关系。
    柬埔寨和中国的关系确实是很悠久的。早在柬埔寨被命名为扶南的时候，也就是大约在十五个世纪以前，我们两国就已有频繁和紧密的往来，而且应当强调指出，我们的往来一向是在友好和希望互相了解的基础上进行的，后来发展成为精神上的和贸易上的往来，从来不曾有过对内政的干涉。不幸的是历史的变化使这种对两国都很有利的联系中断将近一世纪之久。今天，正如两个朋友久别重逢一样，柬埔寨和中国又恢复了他们的传统联系。
    自从1955年在万隆会见以后，可以理解，我们极其顺利地使我们的看法、观点和愿望协调起来。我非常钦佩新中国的领导人，尤其是柬埔寨很熟悉的周恩来先生对于柬埔寨处境的豁达态度和充分的了解；非常钦佩新中国领导人所采取的政策和有礼而正确地对待我们。我深信我们这样的小国可以满怀信心地和它的强大邻国共处，并在和平与共同繁荣的道路上和谐地兄弟般地合作。
    我谨向人民中国的政府表示敬意。人民中国的政府在毛泽东主席的令人钦佩的领导下，在同我们的关系中丝毫不苟地遵守和平共处五项原则。我也愿意借此机会代表柬埔寨人民对中国人民所给予的灵活的、无条件的援助，表示感激。这种援助对于我们实现提高人民生活水平的任务，已经证明是有益的。
    由于你们的勇敢和气魄，你们在几年之内完成了各国历史上也许是独一无二的和平成就。柬埔寨全国都知道你们的成就，并向你们表示衷心的钦佩。我们这个小国约在十年前本来落后于世界上的现代化国家，而且在今天，虽然我们有了进步，仍然是落后的。然而，由于我国人民的团结，由于我国人民在保持荣誉和尊严中的和平意愿，由于中国复兴的榜样，我国人民已经实现并将继续实现令人满意的进步，使我们满怀信心地展望将来。
    最后我代表柬埔寨人民向中国人民致以兄弟般的诚挚的敬意，并谨致祝愿：我们两国的友谊成为具有和平与进步的共同愿望的不同制度国家和平共处的优越的最纯洁的典范。
