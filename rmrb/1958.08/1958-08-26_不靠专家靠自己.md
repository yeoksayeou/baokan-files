　　Relying on Ourselves, Not on Experts
    Recently, the moving story of Ma Xiangwu repairing the automatic elevator has been circulating in central government organs.
    In the import building of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, there were two of the latest model automatic elevators imported in 1954. However, not long after they were installed, they malfunctioned, often stopping automatically when the elevators were going up or down, leaving people hanging in mid-air, neither up nor down. Later, although experts were invited to inspect and repair them, the elevator doors still did not obey orders. Therefore, it was necessary to install a telephone in the elevator for calling for help when it was "neither up nor down."
    When the technological revolution began, the young electrician Ma Xiangwu, who had only attended primary school for three or four years and learned elevator technology from the motor team for a few months, thought: The leadership has said not to be superstitious about experts and technology, as long as we have ambition and drive, we will definitely be able to repair it. So, he stayed by the elevator day and night, carefully observing the elevator's movements, switches, and so on, and finally discovered that the problem with the elevator was in the motor operating the switch and the brake controlling the motor. After two days and two nights of hard work, Ma Xiangwu repaired it. Now, the two elevators go up and down smoothly, and the switches work freely. (Attached picture)

　　不靠专家靠自己
    最近，中央国家机关里，传说着马象梧修好自动电梯的动人事迹。
    对外贸易部进口大楼里，有两架1954年进口的最新式自动电梯，可是，安上不久，就出了毛病，常常在电梯升降的时候，忽然自动停下来。吊在半空中，不上不下。后来，虽然请专家作了检查，并进行了修理，可是电梯门还是不听使唤。这样，不得不在电梯里装上个电话，以备“不上不下”的时候呼救之用。
    技术革命开始了，这个才上过三、四年小学，跟电机队学了几个月电梯技术的青年电工马象梧心里想：领导上不是说不要迷信专家，迷信技术，只要有志气，有干劲，就一定能修好。于是，他不分白天黑夜地守在电梯旁边，仔细观察电梯升降、开关时的情况，终于发现电梯的毛病是出在操纵开关动作的马达和控制马达的抱闸上面。经过两天两夜苦战，马象梧把它修理好了。现在，两架电梯升降顺利，开关自如了。（附图片）
