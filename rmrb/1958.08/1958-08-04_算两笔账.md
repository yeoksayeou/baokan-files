    Calculating Two Accounts
    Jiang Hao
    To make the masses aware of the importance of schistosomiasis prevention, Hanshou County, Hunan Province, calculated two accounts. In the summer of 1957, the Bailian Agricultural Cooperative organized 325 people to cut grass in the lake beach infested with schistosomiasis. Due to the good prevention work, the grass cutting task was completed five days ahead of schedule (originally planned for twenty days), and no one was infected with schistosomiasis. However, at the same time as the Bailian Agricultural Cooperative was cutting grass, the Wuli Agricultural Cooperative organized 54 people to cut grass on the lake beach. Because they did not do preventive work, 43 people were infected with schistosomiasis, including 12 acute infections, and 4 people died. The sick people only gradually returned to work after four months of treatment, resulting in a reduction of more than 2,000 workdays and delaying the rice transplanting time. Comparing the situations of these two cooperatives, the benefits of doing preventive work and the harm of not doing preventive work are obvious. In schistosomiasis-endemic areas, as long as these two accounts are clearly calculated, the masses can use their brains and find ways to do a good job in prevention.

    Doing a good job in prevention work, preventing schistosomiasis from entering the human body, is one of the important links in the comprehensive measures to eliminate schistosomiasis. In recent years, with the comprehensive development of schistosomiasis prevention and control work, people have generally paid attention to prevention work and have explored many methods, and some places have achieved remarkable results. However, some areas have not paid attention to prevention work. In places where prevention work has been generally carried out, some have focused on collective prevention but have not further carried out individual prevention. Some cadres believe that schistosomiasis can only be eliminated by eradicating the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, the Oncomelania hupensis snail. Therefore, they emphasize eradicating snails but neglect prevention work. They have not seriously mobilized and organized the masses to carry out prevention work. A small number of people among the masses do not understand that schistosomiasis is caused by contact with infested water, so they do not know to pay attention to prevention work. Although the vast majority of the masses understand the causes of schistosomiasis, because their understanding is not deep and they are afraid of trouble, afraid of delaying production, and afraid of spending money to buy protective tools and medicines, they do not seriously do prevention work.

    China's schistosomiasis-endemic areas are all in water-network areas. The masses often work in the water. Before the snails are eliminated, any contact with infested water, or even just barefoot contact with dew on the grass or riverbanks where snails release cercariae, carries the risk of infection within seconds. Moreover, schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease with no immunity. People who are infected for the first time can be cured, but if they are not protected, they will be infected a second, third, or more times. For example, in Xinmin Township, Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, by the end of 1957, among the more than 3,000 people in the township suffering from schistosomiasis, more than 1,000 had been repeatedly infected. Some of them had been repeatedly infected as many as four or five times. Therefore, before the snails are eliminated, doing a good job in prevention is an active and effective measure to protect people's production safety, control the development of the disease, and implement the spirit of prevention. Neglecting prevention work is theoretically and practically unfounded. And using the excuse that the effect of prevention work is not significant and not seriously carrying out prevention work is also not in line with the requirements of the masses.

    Now the summer harvest and planting are busy. From now until winter, farmers have many things to do in the water. In order to protect the health of farmers, ensure the completion of production tasks, and comprehensively leap forward in schistosomiasis prevention and control, leaders at all levels in schistosomiasis-endemic areas, especially grassroots leaders, should accept past experiences and lessons, earnestly mobilize the masses, and do a good job in collective and individual prevention work in infested water during the summer and autumn seasons. In the process of mobilizing the masses, in addition to propaganda in various forms, we should also universally compare positive and negative examples and calculate accounts to make the masses deeply aware of the importance of prevention work.

    算两笔账
    江浩
    湖南省汉寿县为了使群众认识血吸虫病防护工作的重要性，算了两笔账。该县白莲农业社在1957年夏季，有三百二十五人上湖滩疫水里割草，由于做好了防护工作，比原计划提早五天完成了割草任务（原计划二十天），无一人感染血吸虫病。而五里农业社，与白莲农业社割草的同时，组织了五十四人上湖滩割草，因为没做防护工作，就有四十三人感染了血吸虫病，其中急性感染的十二人，死了四人。而生病的人，经过四个月的治疗，才陆续参加劳动，计减少出勤二千多个劳动日，并推迟了插秧时间。从这两个社的情况对比中，可以明显地看出做防护工作的好处，和不做防护工作的害处。在血吸虫病流行区内，只要把这两笔账算清楚，就能使群众把算盘打好，想办法把防护工作做好。
    做好防护工作，不让血吸虫钻到人身体里来，是消灭血吸虫病综合措施中的重要环节之一。几年来，随着血吸虫病防治工作的全面开展，人们对于防护工作已经普遍地予以重视，也摸索出了不少办法，有的地方已取得了显著的成效。但是有些地区还没有重视防护工作。而在已经普遍开展防护工作的地方，有的抓住了集体防护，没有进一步深入地开展个人防护。有些干部认为，只有根除了血吸虫的中间宿主钉螺，才能消灭血吸虫病，因此，重根除钉螺，轻防护工作。没有认真发动和组织群众开展防护工作。群众中有一少部分人不了解患血吸虫病是由于接触疫水而感染的，因此不知道要注意防护工作。绝大部分群众虽然了解血吸虫病发病的原因，由于认识得不深刻，又怕麻烦，怕耽误生产，怕花钱购买防护工具和药品，也不认真做防护工作。
    我国血吸虫病流行区都在水网地带。群众经常在水里劳动。在钉螺没有消灭以前，凡是接触疫水，甚或只是赤脚碰上草滩、河岸上有钉螺放射尾蚴的露水，在几秒钟之内，即有被感染的危险。而且，血吸虫病是一种寄生虫病，没有免疫性，第一次被感染的人治好了，如不防护，又会第二次、第三次或者更多次的被感染。如江苏省高邮县新民乡，到1957年底为止，全乡患血吸虫病的三千多人中，被重复感染的即达一千人以上。其中有一部分人重复感染竟达四五次。因之，在未消灭钉螺以前，做好防护工作，这是保护人们生产安全，控制病情发展，贯彻预防精神的积极有效的措施。轻视防护工作，从理论上和实践中是找不到根据的。而借口说防护工作的效果不大，不认真地去开展防护工作，也是不符合群众要求的。
    现在夏收夏种正忙，从现在直到冬季，农民有好多事情都要下水。为了保护农民的健康，保证生产任务的完成和血吸虫病防治工作的全面跃进，血吸虫病流行区的各级领导，特别是基层领导，应该接受过去的经验教训，认真发动群众，做好夏秋季节下疫水的集体防护和个人防护工作。在发动群众的过程中，除去通过各种形式的宣传以外，还应该普遍通过正反事例的对比和算账，使群众深刻认识到防护工作的重要。
