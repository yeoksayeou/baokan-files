Born with a shiny bald head,
No hands, no feet, no claws instead.
Though I'm just a small round sphere,
My abilities are quite clear.
With me in the machines,
They spin so fast, like a breeze.
Installed in mills and windmills so grand,
Saving labor, efficiency at hand.
If I'm placed upon the axle so true,
Even a speedy messenger can't compare to what I can do.
But some refuse to ask me,
They say I'm difficult to make, you see.
Break the superstitions, open your minds,
Whoever wants me, I'm easy to find.
Don't underestimate me, though I'm small,
I'm dedicated to building the motherland, standing tall.

　　滚珠自述自幼生来光头脑，无手无脚无牙爪，虽说我是小圆蛋，论起本事可不小。机器机械有了我，转动如飞轻如毛；碾磨风车安上我，省工省力效率高；我要装在车轴上，神行太保比不了。可是有人不请我，他们说我难制造；破除迷信开心窍，谁要请我我就到。别看我小志气高，建设祖国立功劳。
