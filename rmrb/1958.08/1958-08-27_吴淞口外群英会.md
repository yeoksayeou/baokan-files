Editorial Notes

　　Gathering of Heroes Outside Wusongkou
    After completing the news about the great gathering of ships outside Wusongkou, I was so excited that I wrote a poem to celebrate the grand event.

    A gathering of heroes outside Wusongkou,
    Seven ships unite in great reunion.
    A maritime spectacle never seen before,
    A triumphant report that delights everyone.
    Seven ships, seven poems,
    Each ship has its heroic deeds.
    Deep friendship, forever unforgettable:
    Opponents become helpers.
    Who is a hero, who is a brave man?
    Compete today, compete tomorrow.
    Learn from each other, leap forward together,
    The sea will be even more magnificent in the future.

　　吴淞口外群英会
    编完吴淞口外轮船大会师的新闻，兴奋之余，作诗以祝盛会。
    吴淞口外群英会，
    七艘轮船大团圆。
    海上壮观昔未有，
    一声捷报万众欢。
    七艘轮船七首诗，
    艘艘都有英雄事。
    友谊深厚永难忘：
    对手兼作帮手时。
    谁是英雄谁好汉，
    比过今朝比明天。
    取长补短齐跃进，
    他日海上更壮观。
