Cadres Must Pass the "Masses Test"
　　Yu Shu
    Gaohe Township in Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, is one of the most advanced townships in the Wenjiang Special District. This township has many work characteristics, the most significant of which is the very close relationship between cadres and the masses. The township's Party Committee implements a system where all Party Committee members and branch committee members are not only regularly evaluated at enlarged Party Committee meetings or enlarged branch committee meetings, but also regularly evaluated together with the masses at the members' congresses of the cooperatives they are primarily responsible for. The masses call the former passing the leadership test, and the latter passing the masses test.
    This system of the Gaohe Township Party Committee is a very good system. There has never been a question about our cadres being supervised by the leadership; and this has been fundamentally resolved through the rectification campaign regarding being supervised by the masses. These two types of supervision absolutely cannot be neglected. Although the leadership's supervision is completely consistent with the masses' supervision, the leadership's supervision cannot represent the masses' supervision, and the masses' supervision can enrich and improve the leadership's supervision. Because the leadership and the masses are in different positions, everyone sees problems from different angles. The leadership looks at problems from above, which has its limitations; the masses look at problems from below, which also has its limitations. Problems that the leadership can discover, the masses may not see, and similarly, problems that the masses can discover, the leadership may overlook. This is true for all kinds of work, and it is also true for the evaluation of cadres. Only by combining the leadership's evaluation with the masses' evaluation can this evaluation be comprehensive, and this supervision be comprehensive.
    The masses in Gaohe Township call the evaluation of cadres together with the masses passing the masses test, which is a very good way of putting it. This shows the masses' attitude as masters of the house to actively supervise cadres. Cadres who serve the masses should pass this test of mass supervision. Whether or not one can pass this test is another test of whether cadres can appear in the posture of ordinary laborers. Our grassroots cadres have close contact with the masses and work with them, which of course is appearing in the posture of ordinary laborers. If our grassroots cadres can also conduct evaluations together with the masses and let the masses evaluate how well we are working, isn't this a further demonstration of appearing in the posture of ordinary laborers? At the same time, the evaluation of cadres also educates the masses, which can improve the political consciousness and work level of the masses. On the basis of this common evaluation and common improvement, the understanding of problems and mutual feelings between cadres and the masses will inevitably become more consistent, and the relationship between cadres and the masses will become closer.
    There are many ways for the masses to supervise cadres, and there are many forms for cadres to appear in the posture of ordinary laborers, but there is no doubt that the system of cadres and the masses evaluating together implemented by the Gaohe Township Party Committee is a very effective method for the masses to supervise grassroots cadres and for grassroots cadres to appear in the posture of ordinary laborers.

　　干部要过“群众关”
　　于蜀
    四川邛崃县高何乡，在温江专区是最先进的一个乡。这个乡的工作特点很多，而最显著的则是干部和群众的关系非常密切。这个乡的党委会实行着一种制度：所有党委委员和支部委员，既要定期在党委扩大会或支部扩大会上进行评比，也要定期在自己重点联系的合作社的社员大会上同群众一起进行评比。群众把前者叫作过领导关，把后者叫作过群众关。
    高何乡党委会的这种制度，是一种很好的制度。我们的干部应该受领导的监督，这一点从来没有问题；也应该受群众的监督，这一点经过整风也从根本上得到了解决。这两种监督绝对不能偏废。虽然领导的监督同群众的监督完全一致，可是，领导的监督并不能代表群众的监督，而群众的监督，却可以更加充实和完善领导的监督。因为领导和群众所处的地位不同，大家看问题的角度也不同，领导是从上面来看问题，有它的局限性；群众是从下面来看问题，也有它的局限性。领导上能够发现的问题，群众也许会看不到，同样，群众能够发现的问题，领导上也有可能会忽略掉。对各种工作是如此，对干部的考察也是如此。只有把领导上的考察同群众的考察结合起来，这种考察才会全面，这种监督也才会全面。
    高何乡群众把干部同群众一起评比叫作过群众关，这是一种很好的提法。这表现了群众主动监督干部的主人翁的态度。为群众服务的干部，应该通过群众监督的这一关。能不能通过这一关，也就是对干部能不能以普通劳动者的姿态出现的又一个考验。我们的基层干部同群众亲密交往，同群众一起劳动，这当然是以普通劳动者的态姿出现。如果我们的基层干部再能够同群众一起来进行评比，让群众评一评我们工作得怎么样？这不是进一步表现以普通劳动者的姿态出现吗？同时，通过对干部的评比，反过来也教育了群众，可以提高群众的政治觉悟和工作水平。在这共同评比、共同提高的基础上，干部和群众对问题的认识和彼此的思想感情，必然会更趋一致，干部和群众的关系也就会更加密切。
    群众监督干部的方式很多，干部以普通劳动者的姿态出现的形式也很多，但是，高何乡党委会实行的这种干部和群众一起评比的制度，却是群众监督基层干部和基层干部以普通劳动者姿态出现的很有效的方法，这一点是没有疑问的。
