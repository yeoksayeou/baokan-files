Before us appears a splendid garden of multi-ethnic art; seeing these artistic flowers cultivated by the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, we deeply feel that in a multi-ethnic country, different ethnic groups can jointly pursue the prosperity and development of culture and art under equal rights. Each ethnic group has its own artists, and each ethnic group can use artistic images to express their lives and ideals. This situation never existed before the October Revolution; it is something that only socialist countries can achieve in the world. Before the October Revolution, the Russian Empire, also a multi-ethnic country, did not have the possibility of developing culture and art for its fraternal ethnic groups; cultural backwardness and artistic poverty were prevalent in many ethnic regions at that time. It is not difficult to imagine whether someone in the dim and lightless workers' dormitories of Azerbaijan could depict the bright scenery of the South Caucasus; and how could the Kyrgyz people, who graze in the Pamir Mountains all year round, shape a heroic image that everyone loves with their own hands… This was impossible; in places where class oppression and national discrimination have not been eliminated, where the majority are trapped in hunger and poverty and a few control cultural privileges, it is impossible for art to develop equally among all ethnic groups; it is also impossible for people of all ethnic groups to have the right to appreciate art. When I saw the names of many artists from the Union Republics on the labels of the works in this exhibition, I heard such a voice in my ears: Only socialist soil can make the flowers of art bloom universally and prosperously in the gardens of all ethnic groups. This is the truth. The brilliant achievements that the Soviet Union has made in this regard are the most obvious example.

Another prominent impression the exhibition gave me is that young artists account for a large proportion of all authors. Just by flipping through the catalog and looking at the birth dates of the authors, you can find that many of them were born after the October Revolution; more of them are newcomers who have grown up in Soviet art education. This situation fully demonstrates that once the working class seizes power, a large number of artistic talents will inevitably emerge from the masses of the people continuously; they are the pioneers of art in the new era. Although they are not yet fully mature in terms of life experience and artistic practice, what lies before them is the lofty standard of serving the interests of the working people and being loyal to the socialist motherland; this is the guarantee for the inevitable victory of the socialist art cause, and also the source of unprecedented prosperity and development of artistic creation. Because of this, Chinese artists who are walking on the common road always regard the achievements already made by Soviet artists as the achievements we are about to achieve; and, we must also conduct joint research and learning based on the creative experience of Soviet artists.

Here, I would like to talk about my thoughts on the art works in this exhibition.

Among the exhibited works, those that have attracted the attention of Chinese audiences are those that depict the extraordinary heroic spirit of ordinary people in the Soviet Union (such as Shadarin's "Across the Valley, Over the Plain," Fivesky's "Rather Die Than Submit," Babulin's "Song," Zadorozhny's "They Are Immortal"... etc.); the Chinese people not only respect the characters in these works, but also regard the Soviet artists' praise for these heroic figures, for their courage in battle, their full of confidence in victory, and their full of revolutionary optimism, as an ode to the laboring masses all over the world who have already won and are striving for victory! This should be given high evaluation; because the most profound change in human history is the change in the status of the laboring masses in social life; in our memory, we can never forget these two different eras of pictures; one side is the miserable life of being exploited and persecuted, hunger, disease and death, "the lonely funeral carriage in the desolate suburbs, the terror of orphans and the tears of widows"... This is a picture of the old era once depicted by the 19th century Russian painter Perov, a picture of the laboring masses who have not yet escaped their slave status. On the other side, a completely new picture has emerged: strong hands that have broken the chains of slavery, minds that have been liberated to be the masters of their own affairs, and strong strides dashing on the revolutionary road... This is a picture of the new era, a picture of the laboring masses who have gained the status of masters of the country, a picture of the battles of the laboring masses who have already won and are striving for victory. People all over the world are watching him, because he is the hope of the future of mankind; because he is a huge force that encourages the advancement of the revolution and the advancement of life. Thank you to the Soviet artists for their achievements in expressing the valuable qualities of the laboring masses, and hope to expand their influence in the field of art creation and become a model of highly ideological creation.

As a genre painting alongside landscape paintings, still life paintings, portrait paintings, etc., genre painting occupied a very high position in the history of Russian painting in the 19th century; the practical significance of genre painting has exceeded the scope of expressing the daily life and customs of the people; it further involves the depiction of human relationships, the depiction of class relationships, and the exposure of the evils caused by unreasonable social systems; this can be easily found in the works of many great painters in the 19th century. After the success of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet regime, the old class relations changed, the relationships between people changed, and even the social life and customs changed; this change is often concentratedly expressed through a side of life, and if it is compared with the memories of the old society, it will show the great significance and unparalleled superiority of the socialist system; I think this is the ideological foundation of genre painting in the socialist era; all those life scenes that embody major changes are the best subjects for genre painters. In the works exhibited this time, Kabachek's "Returning from the Festival" is very similar to this kind of subject matter; he uses the intricate scenes of the festival streets to describe the joy of the collective farmers whose lives have changed. In terms of expressive techniques, he also tries his best to approach the simple and meticulous style of traditional genre painting. In addition, Grigoriev's "Red Scarf," Korolenko's "Competition," and Chigali's "Dreamers" all start from revealing the mental activities of children, thereby guiding the audience to explore the essence of the new social life; although these three works differ in terms of ideological depth, they are all works worthy of artistic recollection.

Soviet artists have made very considerable achievements in both landscape painting and portrait painting; especially in landscape painting, it is almost effortless and full of wonderful interest; what the authors show on the screen is not only the natural scenery itself, but also permeates the authors' own emotions. A small piece of residual snow still remains on the cultivated land of "Early Spring"; warm smoke lightly floats on the "Locomotive Assembly Yard"; the sunlight jumping on the water surface of the "Upper Agara River," the delicate new green of "Spring Seedlings"; "Dnieper River at Dusk," a river lamp in the vast twilight... Many examples are endless, these beautiful lyrical poems are almost in every exhibition hall, and they all show different artistic charms in terms of performance skills, which are worth learning from us. In terms of portrait painting, Malyutin's "Portrait of Belousova," Ivanov's "Komsomol Member," Adamova's "Silk Reeler," Likhachev's "Portrait of Son" and many other portrait works are all works with high artistic expression.

Outstanding Soviet illustrators Veleisky, Kukryniksy, Korovin, Dubinsky, etc. are all relatively familiar to Chinese readers; the common feature of their works is that they not only embody the character of the characters in literary works with visual artistic images, but also embody the ideological depth of the works, making the theme of the works more distinct. Although there are not many of their works exhibited this time, they have also received high evaluation from the audience.

Of course, judging from all the exhibited works, due to the different understanding of life and the training of artistic skills of the authors, the ideological level and artistic level are also very different; the themes of some works are not clear enough, and the artistic expression of some works is not skilled enough; this is an unavoidable phenomenon from the perspective of the development process of art; as long as we continue to strengthen the exercise of life and the practice of art, the immeasurable development prospects of socialist plastic arts must appear in history.

    苏联美术家作品展览会观后感
    蔡若虹
    在我们眼前出现的，是一个灿烂的多民族的造型艺术的花园；看到这些由苏联各族人民培养出来的艺术花朵，我们就深切的感到，在一个多民族的国家里，不同的民族可以在同等的权利下共谋文化艺术的繁荣和发展，每个民族都有他们自己的艺术家，每个民族都能用艺术形象来表现他们的生活和理想，这种情况，在十月革命以前是不曾有过的事情；在世界各国中也只有社会主义国家才能作到的事情。在十月革命以前，同样是多民族的俄罗斯帝国，就毫不存在为兄弟民族发展文化艺术的可能；文化落后和艺术贫乏的现象，在当时的很多民族区域中普遍地存在；不难想像，在阿塞拜疆的低暗无光的工人宿舍里，能不能有人去描绘南高加索的明媚的风光；而终年在帕米尔山区放牧的吉尔吉斯人，又怎能用自己的双手塑造一个大家所喜爱的英雄形象……这是不可能的；在阶级压迫和民族歧视还没有消灭的地方，在多数人陷入饥饿和穷困的绝境而少数人掌握文化特权的地方，要想艺术在各个民族中得到同样的发展是不可能的；要想各族人民都能获得艺术欣赏的权利也是不可能的。当我在这个展览会的作品标签上看见很多加盟共和国艺术家的名字的时候，我的耳边就响起了这样的声音：只有社会主义的土壤，才能够使艺术的花朵在各个民族的园地里普遍开放和日益繁荣。这是真理。苏联在这一方面已经取得的光辉成就是最明显的例证。
    展览会给我另一个突出的印象，是青年美术家在全部作者中占有很大的比重。只要翻开目录看看作者们的诞生年月，就可以发现有很多作者是诞生在十月革命以后；更多的作者是由苏联美术教育中成长起来的新人。这个情况充分说明了工人阶级一经掌握政权之后，就必然会从人民群众中间不间断地产生大批的艺术能手；他们是新时代艺术的开拓者，尽管在生活经历和艺术实践方面不够完全成熟，但是摆在他们面前的，是为劳动人民利益服务、为社会主义祖国效忠的崇高标准；这是社会主义艺术事业必然取得胜利的保证，也是艺术创作获得空前的繁荣与发展的源泉。由于这样，走在共同道路上的中国美术家们，总是把苏联美术家已经取得的成就看作是我们将要取得的成就；并且，还要根据苏联美术家的创作经验，进行共同的研究和学习。
    在这里，我想谈谈对这次展览的美术作品的感想。
    在展出的作品当中，曾经引起中国观众注目的，是那些描写苏联的普通人民那种非凡的英雄气魄的作品（如沙达林的“穿过山谷、越过平原”、菲维斯基的“宁死不屈”、巴布林的“歌”、札道罗日内的“他们永垂不朽”……等等）；中国人民不仅仅敬重这些作品中的人物，而且把苏联艺术家对于这些英雄人物的歌颂，对于这些在战斗中勇往直前、充满了胜利的信心、充满了革命的乐观主义精神的歌颂，当作是对全世界已经取得胜利和正在争取胜利的劳动群众的讴歌！这是应当给以高度的估价的；因为，人类历史上最深刻的变化，就是劳动群众在社会生活中的地位的变化；在我们的记忆里面，总不能忘记这样两个不同时代的图画；一边是被剥削被迫害的悲惨生涯、饥饿、疾病和死亡，“寂寞荒郊的送葬马车，孤儿的恐怖和寡妇的眼泪”……。这是十九世纪俄罗斯画家别罗夫曾经描写过的旧时代的图画，是劳动群众还没有摆脱奴隶地位的图画。而另一边，却出现了一幅全新的画面：是扭断了奴隶锁链的坚强的手，是解放了思想的当家作主的头脑，是飞奔在革命大道上的雄健的阔步……。这是新时代的图画，是劳动群众取得了国家主人公地位的图画，是已经胜利和正在争取胜利的劳动群众的战斗的图画。全世界人民都注视着他，因为他是人类未来的希望；因为他是鼓舞着革命前进、鼓舞着生活前进的巨大的力量。感谢苏联美术家在表现劳动群众的可贵品质方面所取得的成就，并且希望在美术创作领域中扩大影响，成为具有高度思想性的创作的榜样。
    作为与风景画、静物画、肖像画等等相并列的风俗画，在十九世纪俄罗斯绘画史上占有很高的地位；风俗画的实际意义，已经超过了表现人民日常生活风习的范围；进而涉及到人与人的关系的描写，阶级关系的描写，以及对于不合理的社会制度所产生的罪恶的揭露；这在十九世纪许多大画家的作品中是很容易发现的。当十月革命成功苏维埃政权建立以后，旧的阶级关系改变了，人的相互关系改变了，连社会生活风习也改变了；这种变化常常通过一个生活的侧面集中地表现出来，如果将它和旧社会的记忆作一个对照，就会显出社会主义制度的重大意义和无比的优越性；我认为这就是社会主义时代风俗画的思想基础；凡是那种体现了重大变革的生活场景，都是风俗画家的最好题材。在这次展出的作品中，卡巴切克的“节日归来”很类似这种题材；他通过节日街头的那种错综复杂的景象，来描写那些生活上起了变化的集体农民的欢快。就在表现手法上面，也极力接近传统风俗画中那种朴实而又细致的风格。此外，格里果利耶夫的“红领巾”、科罗连科的“比赛”和齐加里的“幻想家们”，都是从揭露儿童们的精神活动这点出发，从而引导观众走到探索新的社会生活的实质这个终点上去；这三件作品虽然在思想深度方面各有不同，但都是在艺术上值得回味的作品。
    苏联美术家在风景画和肖像画这两方面的成绩是十分可观的；尤其在风景画方面，几乎是信手拈来，都成妙趣；作者们在画面上表现出来的，已经不只是自然风物本身，而且还渗透着作者们自己的感情。“初春”的耕地上还留着一小块残雪；“机车装配场”上轻飘着温暖的云烟；“阿加拉河上游”水面上跳跃的阳光，“春天的禾苗”的娇嫩的新绿；“德聂伯河上的黄昏”，苍茫暮色中的一盏河灯……许多例子是举不完的，这种优美的抒情诗篇，几乎每间展览室里都有，而且在表现技巧上都显示出不同的艺术魅力，很值得我们学习。在肖像画方面，马留金的“别洛乌索娃肖像”，伊万诺夫的“共青团员”，阿达莫娃的“缫丝女工”，里哈切夫的“儿子的肖像”以及其它很多肖像作品，都是具有很高的艺术表现力的作品。
    杰出的苏联插图画家维列伊斯基、库克雷尼克塞、科罗温、杜宾斯基等，在中国读者中都是比较熟悉的；他们作品的共同特色是：不仅用视觉的艺术形象体现了文学作品中的人物性格，而且还体现了作品的思想深度，使作品的主题更为鲜明。这次展出他们的作品虽然不多，但同样获得了观众的很高的评价。
    当然，从展出的全部作品看来，由于作者们对于生活的认识和艺术技巧的锻炼各不相同，所以在思想水平和艺术水平方面也很不一样；有些作品的主题思想不够明确，有些作品的艺术表现不够熟练；这从艺术的发展过程来说是不可避免的现象；只要不断加强生活的锻炼和艺术的实践，社会主义造型艺术不可限量的发展前途，是一定要在历史上出现的。
