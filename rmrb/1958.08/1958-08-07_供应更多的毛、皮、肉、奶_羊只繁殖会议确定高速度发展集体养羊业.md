Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 6th: The National Sheep Breeding Improvement On-Site Conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Aohan Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has determined the plan and fundamental measures for the high-speed development of sheep farming.

Since liberation, China's sheep farming industry has made great progress. By the end of 1957, the number of sheep and goats in the country had reached 98.49 million, an increase of 132.6% compared to 1949 and 57.5% compared to 1937, the year with the largest number of sheep before the war. In Aohan Banner, where the conference was held, brilliant achievements have been made in sheep breeding and improvement. This year, the total number of livestock in the banner has increased by a net 21%. However, the rapid development of the national socialist construction requires the sheep farming industry to also move quickly, supplying large quantities of wool, hides, meat, and milk to meet the needs of industrial production and people's lives. In particular, the rapidly developing wool textile industry and leather industry have put forward the most urgent and enormous production tasks to the sheep farming industry.

Based on the above requirements, after fully discussing and studying the enormous potential of China's sheep farming industry, and citing many specific facts and advanced examples to criticize various erroneous arguments and conservative ideas hindering the development of the sheep farming industry, the conference proposed fundamental measures for the high-speed development of sheep farming. The conference believes that vigorously developing collective sheep farming in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives is the fundamental way to achieve a great leap forward in the sheep farming industry in the future. In terms of sheep development, the policy of comprehensive and large-scale development of both sheep and goats should be implemented. Sheep have high economic value, and there are still many places that can raise them but have not, so they should be universally developed. Goats are adaptable to a wider range of areas and have a high reproduction rate, so they must also be actively developed. In order to increase the sheep reproduction rate, it is first necessary to increase the proportion of ewes in the herd, not slaughtering breeding-capable female animals, and always maintain the proportion of ewes of appropriate age at more than 50%. Secondly, it is necessary to vigorously promote the "one hundred lambs from one hundred ewes" and "twin lambs" campaigns. Third, in areas with suitable conditions, it is advocated that ewes have two litters a year or three litters in two years. The conference suggested that townships and cooperatives should establish high-yield experimental groups, just like planting high-yield fields, and use typical examples to drive the general.

The conference studied the direction of sheep improvement work. The conference pointed out that according to the needs of national economic development and natural conditions, the direction of sheep improvement nationwide should focus on fine-wool sheep that are both wool and meat producing. Coarse wool has its special uses in the wool textile industry, such as weaving carpets and making plush, so in some areas that originally produced high-quality coarse-wool sheep, it is necessary to maintain, develop, and improve coarse-wool sheep. Fur and lambskin have high economic value and are valuable cold-weather clothing materials. All areas that currently raise fur sheep and lambskin sheep must retain and vigorously develop them. The conference required all localities to adhere to the mass line, entrust the work of improving sheep breeds to agricultural and pastoral cooperatives themselves, truly achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, and promote the widespread and comprehensive development of sheep improvement work.

The conference believes that the high-speed development of sheep farming depends not only on high-speed breeding but also on good feeding and management. Therefore, representatives from various regions conducted in-depth research on issues such as feeding management, fodder and feed, disease prevention and control, and organizational leadership of the sheep farming industry, and formulated relatively detailed specific measures.

A total of 378 representatives from 15 key sheep-raising provinces and autonomous regions, 9 scientific research units, and relevant central departments attended the conference. The conference lasted for eleven days and ended on July 25. (Attached picture)

### 供应更多的毛、皮、肉、奶  羊只繁殖会议确定高速度发展集体养羊业

    供应更多的毛、皮、肉、奶
    羊只繁殖会议确定高速度发展集体养羊业
    据新华社呼和浩特6日电　农业部在内蒙古自治区敖汉旗召开的全国羊只繁殖改良现场会议，确定了高速度发展养羊业的规划和根本措施。
    解放以来，我国养羊业有了很大发展。1957年底，全国绵羊、山羊已达九千八百四十九万只，比1949年增加132.6％，比战前羊只最多的1937年增加57.5％。在会议召开地的敖汉旗，羊只繁殖和改良都取得了光辉的成绩，今年全旗牲畜已纯增21％。但是全国社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，要求养羊业也快马加鞭，供应大量毛、皮、肉、奶，以满足工业生产和人民生活的需要。特别是迅速发展的毛纺织工业和皮革工业，更向养羊业提出了最迫切的巨大生产任务。
    会议根据上述要求，在充分讨论和研究了我国养羊业的巨大潜力，引证许多具体事实和先进事例来批驳了各种阻碍养羊业发展的错误论调和保守思想以后，提出了高速度发展养羊业的根本措施。会议认为，大力发展农牧业社的集体养羊业，是今后养羊业大跃进的根本途径。在羊只发展上，应该贯彻绵羊、山羊全面大发展的方针。绵羊经济价值高，现在还有许多能养的地方未养，应当普遍发展。山羊适应的地区更广，繁殖率高，也须积极发展。为了提高羊只繁殖率，首先要提高畜群中母羊的比例，不要宰杀有繁殖能力的母畜，把适龄母畜的比例经常保持在50％以上。其次要大搞“百母百羔”和“双羔”运动。第三，在有条件的地区，提倡母羊一年两胎或两年三胎。会议建议乡乡社社搞高产试验群，像种丰产田一样，通过典型来带动一般。
    会议研究了羊只改良工作方向。会议指出，根据国民经济发展的需要和自然条件，全国绵羊改良方向应该以毛肉兼用的细毛羊为主。粗羊毛在毛纺织工业上有它的特殊用途，如织地毯、制长毛绒，因此在部分原产优良粗毛羊的地区，要保持发展和提高粗毛羊。裘皮、羔皮经济价值高，是珍贵的御寒衣料。凡是现在饲养裘皮羊、羔皮羊的地区都要保留并大力发展。会议要求各地坚持群众路线，把改良羊种工作交由农、牧业社自办，真正做到多、快、好、省，促进绵羊改良工作遍地开花，全面大发展。
    会议认为高速度发展养羊业，不仅取决于高速度地增殖，还取决于良好的饲养和管理。因此，各地代表对饲养管理、饲草饲料，疫病防治和养羊业的组织领导等问题，都在深入研究后制定了比较详尽的具体措施。
    参加会议的有十五个养羊重点省、自治区，九个科学研究单位和中央有关部门的代表共三百七十八人。会议历时十一天，在7月25日结束。（附图片）
