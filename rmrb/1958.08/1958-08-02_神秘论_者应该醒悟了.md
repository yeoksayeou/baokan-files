"Mysticism" Adherents Should Wake Up
　　Tián Gēng

In recent days, this newspaper has continuously reported on the widespread development of ball bearings across the country. This is an exciting and important event. It shows that China's agricultural technology level is about to break away from the heavy state of manual labor and enter a new stage—the semi-mechanized stage.

From the widespread development of ball bearings across the country, it can be seen that although conditions vary from place to place, each with its own characteristics, one point is common: that is, manufacturing ball bearings is not as difficult or mysterious as the "mysticism" adherents say; on the contrary, it is quite easy. Not only can county-level handicraft iron and woodworking factories make them, but even township and commune levels can make them; in many places, not only can they make ball bearings, but they have also created machines for manufacturing ball bearings. The facts in places where ball bearing industries have already been established prove that as long as they are determined, fully mobilize and resolutely rely on the masses, achieving the bearingization of all rotating tools is only a matter of ten or twenty days, at most two or three months. In the face of such a large number of facts, shouldn't the "mysticism" adherents wake up?

The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party called on us to "break superstitions and liberate our minds." However, "mysticism" adherents intentionally or unintentionally bind themselves tightly with all kinds of superstitious ropes. Their heads are filled with rigid rules and regulations, and they always have a framework when looking at any problem. They say: "Bearingization of rotating tools? Easier said than done! Ball bearings are a product of modern industry and can only be manufactured in modern factories." The tragedy of "mysticism" adherents lies here. They only see the function of machines, but they do not see the role of people. They have forgotten the well-known fact that machines not only need people to operate them but are also created by people. Human effort is key; the people are the creators of history. Whoever ignores the great power of the people will run counter to Marxism and will run into a wall in the face of facts. Comrade Shaoqi once said: Whatever human beings can do, the Chinese people can do. Isn't that the truth? Not only are we doing what the ancients and foreigners could do, but we have also done many things that the ancients and foreigners could not do. Taking agricultural production as an example, which dynasty or country has seen agricultural output increase by 60%-70% in a single year? Only us. The output of our summer crops is growing at this rate. Which dynasty or country has built such large-scale farmland irrigation projects in a few months? It is also us. In just about half a year, we have expanded the irrigated area by more than 400 million mu. Is it because we have machines and modern factories that we have done all this? No. Machines and modern industry have contributed to all these great achievements, but the main thing is the hard work of more than 500 million working farmers. The people know the role of machines and industry in the production process, but they do not regard machines as sacred objects that are daunting, as "mysticism" adherents do; instead, they make their own machines and run industries. Vigorously developing the ball bearing industry and bearingizing all rotating tools is to replace backward production tools with advanced agricultural machinery and is a concrete step to place China's agricultural technology on a modern technological foundation. The working people have not mystified ball bearings, and the working people believe in their own strength. Therefore, they have succeeded, not only making ball bearings of various specifications, but also making machines for manufacturing ball bearings.

Those who still hold a mystical view of ball bearings should wake up and see more of the role of people! The Chinese people are not ordinary people, they are people who have been completely liberated and become masters of their own destiny, they are people who are determined to bravely advance towards socialism and communism, and such people are capable of creating all miracles.

    “神秘论”者应该醒悟了
    田耕
    这几天，本报连续报道了各地大搞滚珠轴承的消息。这是一件令人兴奋的大事情。它说明：我国的农业技术水平即将开始摆脱繁重的手工劳动状态，进入到一个新的阶段——半机械化阶段。
    从各地大搞滚珠轴承中，可以看出，虽然各地条件不同，各有各的特点，但有一点却是共同的：这就是制造滚珠轴承并不像“神秘论”者说的那么困难，那么神秘；相反，倒是相当容易的。不仅县里的手工业铁、木工厂可以造，连乡里社里也能造；很多地方不仅能造滚珠轴承，还创造出了制造滚珠轴承的机器。已经搞起滚珠轴承工业的地方的事实证明：只要下定决心，充分发动并坚决依靠群众，实现一切运转工具轴承化也只是十天二十天的事情，至多三、两个月也就足够了。在这样大量的事实面前，“神秘论”者还不该醒悟吗？
    党的八大二次会议号召我们：要“破除迷信，解放思想”。“神秘论”者却有意无意地用各种各样迷信的绳索，把自己牢牢地捆绑起来。脑袋里装满了清规戒律，他们不论看待什么问题，总有一个框子。他们说：“运转工具滚珠轴承化么？谈何容易！滚珠轴承是现代工业的产物，只有现代化的工厂里才能制造。”“神秘论”者的悲剧正在这里。他们只看见了机器的功能，却看不见人的作用。他们忘记了机器不仅是要人来开动而且也是人创造的这个尽人皆知的事实。事在人为，人民群众才是历史的创造者，谁忽视了人民群众这个伟大的力量，谁就会同马克思主义背道而驰，谁就会在事实面前碰壁。少奇同志曾说：凡是人类能够做的事，我国人民都能够做。事实不正是这样么？不仅古人、洋人能作的事，我们正在作，而且有古人、洋人做不到的许多事，我们也已经做到了。仅以农业生产而论，有哪一个朝代、哪一个国家的农业产量，一年就能增长60％—70％？只有我们。我们的夏季作物的产量就是以这样的速度增长的。有哪一个朝代、哪一个国家几个月之内兴修过这样大规模的农田水利？也是我们。仅仅半年左右的时间，我们就扩大了灌溉面积四亿多亩。是因为我们有机器、有现代化的工厂才做出了这一切吗？不。在这一切巨大的成就中有机器和现代工业的功劳，但主要却是五亿多劳动农民的辛勤劳动。人民群众知道机器和工业在生产过程中的作用，但他们却不像“神秘论”者那样，把机器视为神物，令人望而却步；而是自己动手造机械、办工业。大办滚珠轴承工业，把一切运转的工具轴承化，就是要用先进的农业机器，代替落后的生产工具，就是要把我国的农业技术置于现代化技术基础上的具体步骤。劳动人民没有把滚珠轴承神秘化，劳动人民相信自己的力量，因此，他们成功了，不仅造出了各种规格的滚珠轴承，还造出了制造滚珠轴承的机器。
    对滚珠轴承仍然抱有神秘观点的人，应该猛醒了，更多地看到人的作用吧！我国人民不是普通的人民，是获得了彻底解放成为自己命运主人的人民，是决心向社会主义和共产主义勇敢前进的人民，这样的人民是能够创造出一切奇迹的。
