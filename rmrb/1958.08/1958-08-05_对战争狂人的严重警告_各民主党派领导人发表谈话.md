    The alliance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union are the core of uniting all peace, democracy, and socialist forces in the world and the fundamental guarantee for preventing imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace. If imperialist aggressors fail to recognize the strength of the great unity between China and the Soviet Union, they will meet a crushing defeat before this strength.

In this meeting, China and the Soviet Union reached a complete agreement on all the issues discussed, fully demonstrating the further strengthening of the friendly, allied, and mutually supportive relationship between the two countries. At a time when peace is seriously threatened by US-British imperialism, this communiqué is a stern warning to the manufacturers of war. Peace-loving people all over the world will draw encouragement and strength from the communiqué.

    The spokesman for the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said that all members of our China Democratic National Construction Association and industrialists and businessmen across the country, like the people of the whole country, are extremely excited to warmly congratulate the significant achievements of the talks and resolutely support all the decisions of the communiqué.

    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that this meeting fully demonstrated the unbreakable fraternal unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union and their firm determination to safeguard world peace and oppose imperialist wars of aggression. This unity and determination are a reliable guarantee for preventing imperialist wars of aggression. If imperialist warmongers dare to impose war on the people of the world, all peace-loving countries and people will unite closely to completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors and lay the foundation for lasting world peace.

    Ji Fang, Acting Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that the Communiqué of the Talks between Chairman Mao and Chairman Khrushchev expresses the common will and aspirations of the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world. We love peace and have already made great achievements in the cause of safeguarding peace. However, peace-loving people are never afraid of war. If the imperialists insist on imposing war on our heads, we will, together with the people of the world, completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors and bring lasting peace to the world.

Peace-loving people all over the world will be very excited and encouraged. On behalf of all comrades of the Zhi Gong Party and the masses with whom we are connected, I warmly support this communiqué and will take practical actions to strive to realize the urgent tasks proposed in the communiqué.

    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that this meeting will inevitably have a decisive impact on the world situation. Relaxing international tensions, opposing imperialist aggression, preventing new war disasters, advocating the immediate convening of a summit conference of major powers, disarmament, and stopping the testing and banning the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons are the common aspirations and demands of the people all over the world. This communiqué represents these aspirations and demands.
