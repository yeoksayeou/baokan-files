　　Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 6th Dispatch: Argentine social figures advocate establishing diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations with the People's Republic of China.

　　A special meeting of people from all walks of life, including workers, intellectuals, and political figures, was held in Buenos Aires on the 4th. The meeting unanimously advocated that Argentina establish diplomatic relations with China.

　　Argentine parliamentarian Teko introduced the great achievements made by the Chinese people in peaceful and creative labor at the conference. He also said that depriving the 600 million Chinese people of their legitimate rights in the United Nations is "extremely absurd" and that "the People's Republic of China should occupy its seat in the United Nations."
