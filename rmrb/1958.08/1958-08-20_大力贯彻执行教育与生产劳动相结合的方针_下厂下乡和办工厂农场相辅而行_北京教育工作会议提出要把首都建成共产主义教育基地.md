Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an education work conference. Based on summarizing the experiences of education work, and in accordance with the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, the conference proposed specific measures for implementation, emphasizing that currently, political and ideological work should be strengthened, and that the two methods of sending teachers and students to factories and the countryside and running factories and farms by themselves should be adopted in a mutually reinforcing and complementary manner. It also proposed that within the Second Five-Year Plan, Beijing should be built into an advanced communist education base for the whole country.

The conference conveyed the spirit of the Central Education Work Conference, exchanged experiences gained in implementing the Party's education policy, and reviewed the education work of the past few years.

The conference believes that in order to implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, it is necessary to vigorously develop education, popularize primary and junior high school education, eliminate illiteracy within two years, and promote the establishment of various types of schools in factories, rural areas, and other fields. On the other hand, it is necessary to improve the quality of education in existing schools and thoroughly realize education reform. The conference pointed out that in order to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist consciousness in institutions of higher learning, it is necessary to closely combine teaching, productive labor, and scientific research; and that all work in schools needs to be led by politics and strengthen the leadership of the Party committee.

The conference pointed out the necessity of strengthening political and ideological work. It is necessary to carry out the study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works on the basis of the impending end of the rectification movement. Strive to consolidate the leadership of Marxism-Leninism in every unit, every course, and every scientific department. All political theory courses should focus on studying the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and construction to strengthen the theoretical education and theoretical construction of Marxism-Leninism. All courses in schools should also be guided by Marxism-Leninism, and strive to plant the red flag of Marxism-Leninism on the front of natural science as soon as possible. In the higher grades of institutions of higher learning, some courses on bourgeois theories can be set up as negative teaching materials. In terms of the teaching staff, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate new teachers, so that they can become both red and expert teachers through various exercises such as labor and practical work, ideological struggle, and criticism of bourgeois academic thought. It is necessary to actively transform old teachers, and continue to implement the Party's united front policy and the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. At present, the main task for old teachers is to unite them to participate in the practice of realizing the general line, and to promote their further ideological transformation.

The conference analyzed the two main methods currently adopted by Beijing's institutions of higher learning to integrate education with productive labor and theory with practice. It believes that the advantages of teachers and students going to factories, the countryside, and the front line are that they not only combine with productive labor, but also combine with workers and peasants. Teachers and students living with workers and peasants can better transform their own thinking; the practice of production and work outside the school is much richer than that inside the school; it can greatly improve the level of teaching and scientific research; at the same time, schools can also use manpower and technology to support technological and cultural revolutions in factories, rural areas, and other fields. The advantages of schools running factories, farms, schools, hospitals, and stores by themselves are that teachers and students can often participate in labor and practical work, and learn the knowledge of managing production; it is convenient to combine teaching and scientific research nearby; it can increase national wealth, save expenses, and support national economic construction. Therefore, these two methods should be combined with each other and complement each other, and schools and majors of different nature should have different practices. The factories run by science and engineering departments should be combined with teaching and scientific research, and give full play to the potential of existing internship factories, laboratories, and teachers and students to engage in industrial production. At the same time, teachers and students should also be organized to participate in productive labor outside the school, and they can undertake tasks such as engineering design, research and experiments, and geological exploration, or participate in the basic construction of factories and help counties, districts, and townships run industries. Students of social sciences, literature, law, and art should mainly go to factories, the countryside, and the front line, where they can work, do practical work, and conduct investigations and research, while conducting on-site teaching. In order to facilitate frequent participation in labor, each school also needs to run some small factories appropriately. However, schools must consider the issues of raw materials, sales, and economic accounting when running factories, and prevent blind development, so as not to dampen the enthusiasm of the masses.

Institutions of higher learning should help factories, rural areas, government organs, and streets run schools; run various spare-time schools, correspondence schools, and short-term training courses; help existing middle schools run schools, and some schools can also run affiliated middle schools by themselves.

The conference discussed the scientific research work of institutions of higher learning, believing that this work should also implement the policy of serving proletarian politics and serving productive labor. In the research work of natural science, efforts should be made to catch up with the international advanced level in important scientific departments as soon as possible. To this end, it is necessary to concentrate a group of forces to engage in cutting-edge science and technology; closely cooperate with socialist construction, combine with the mass technological revolution, study and solve the technical problems raised in production, summarize advanced production experience, and constantly design and trial-produce new products; and attach importance to the research of basic theoretical science. In the social sciences, it is necessary to go deep into reality to summarize the experience of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and raise it to the level of theory. Implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, vigorously carry out academic and ideological criticism, and eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideas in various disciplines.

The conference also discussed the issue of strengthening the Party's leadership in institutions of higher learning. It believes that politics must be in command in all work, and the mass line must be followed. In the current work, it is necessary to fight against right-leaning conservative ideas inside and outside the Party. While grasping teaching and scientific research, the Party committees of all schools should also grasp economic production and conscientiously implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily. The economic work of the school should also implement the mass line, and mobilize the masses to discuss the school's economic plan and budget. In running factories, farms, and scientific research, it is necessary to conscientiously implement comprehensive and large-scale collaboration, and oppose departmentalism.

The conference discussed how factories, rural areas, and primary and secondary school education should implement the Party's education policy, pointing out that in spare-time schools run in factories, it is necessary to quickly combine with the actual production of the factory to carry out education reform, especially in courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and should use more of the problems in the actual production of the factory to explain.

　　大力贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针
　　下厂下乡和办工厂农场相辅而行
　　北京教育工作会议提出要把首都建成共产主义教育基地
    新华社19日讯  中共北京市委员会最近举行了教育工作会议，会议在总结教育工作经验的基础上，根据教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，提出了贯彻执行的具体办法，强调目前应该加强政治思想工作，采用师生下厂下乡和自办工厂、农场两种方式互相结合相辅而行的做法。并提出在第二个五年计划内，要把北京建成为全国的一个先进的共产主义教育基地。
    会上传达了中央教育工作会议的精神，交流了贯彻党的教育工作方针所取得的经验，同时对过去几年的教育工作作了检查。
    会议认为目前贯彻执行教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，必须一方面大力发展教育工作，普及小学和初中教育，在两年之内扫除文盲，提倡工厂、农村等方面举办各类学校，另一方面要提高现有学校的教育质量，彻底实现教育改革。会议指出，在高等学校中，为了培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，就必须使教学、生产劳动和科学研究三者密切的结合；并指出一切学校中的工作，都需要政治挂帅，加强党委的领导。
    会议指出加强政治思想工作的必要性。要在整风运动即将结束的基础上，开展马列主义的理论和毛泽东同志著作的学习运动。争取在每个单位、每门课程、每个科学部门中巩固地树立起马列主义的领导。各门政治理论课都要以研究中国革命与建设的实际问题为中心，来加强马列主义理论教育和理论建设。学校中各门课程也应当以马列主义为指导思想，争取尽快地在自然科学的阵地上插上马列主义的红旗。在高等学校高年级中可以设立一些资产阶级学说的课程作为反面教材。在教师队伍方面，要大力培养新教师，使他们经过劳动和做实际工作，经过思想斗争和对资产阶级学术思想批判等各种锻炼成为又红又专的教师。要积极改造老教师，继续执行党的统一战线和党的团结改造知识分子的政策。目前对老教师主要是团结他们参加实现总路线的实践，推动他们进一步思想改造。
    会议对目前北京各高等学校中实行教育同生产劳动、理论与实际结合所采用的两种主要办法作了分析。认为师生下厂、下乡、下现场办法的好处是：不但和生产劳动结合而且可以和工农结合。师生同工农生活在一起，这可以更好地改造自己的思想；校外的生产与工作实践比校内要丰富得多；可以大大提高教学和科学研究的水平；同时学校也可以以人力和技术支援工厂、农村及其他方面的技术革命和文化革命。学校自办工厂、农场、学校、医院、商店办法的好处是：师生可以经常参加劳动与实际工作，学习管理生产的知识；便于就近结合教学和科学研究；可以增加国家财富，节约开支，支援国家经济建设。因此，这两种办法应该互相结合相辅而行，不同性质的学校和专业应该有不同的做法。理工各科自办的工厂，要与教学与科学研究相结合，发挥现有实习工厂、实验室和师生的潜力从事工业生产。同时也应当组织师生到校外参加生产劳动，可以承揽工程设计、研究试验、地质勘探等任务，也可以参加工厂的基本建设，帮助县、区、乡办工业。社会科学和文法、艺术各科学生应当以下厂、下乡、下现场为主，在那里边劳动边做实际工作和调查研究，同时进行现场教学。为了便于经常参加劳动，各校也需要适当地自办些小工厂。但是，学校办工厂，必须考虑到原料、销路、经济核算的问题，防止盲目发展，以致挫伤群众的积极性。
    高等学校应当帮助工厂、农村、机关、街道办学校；举办各种业余学校、函授学校、短期训练班；帮助现有的中学办学，有的学校还可以自办附属中学。
    会议讨论了高等学校的科学研究工作，认为这个工作也应当贯彻为无产阶级的政治服务、为生产劳动服务的方针。在自然科学的研究工作方面要争取在重要的科学部门尽快地赶上国际先进水平。为此，需要集中一批力量搞尖端科学技术；要密切配合社会主义建设，与群众性的技术革命相结合，研究解决生产中提出的技术问题，总结先进生产经验，不断设计试制新产品；并且要重视基础理论科学的研究。在社会科学方面，要深入实际总结社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验，把它提高到理论上来。贯彻百花齐放百家争鸣的方针，大力开展学术思想批判，肃清各门学科中的资产阶级思想影响。
    会议还就加强高等学校中的党的领导问题作了讨论。认为在一切工作中都必须政治挂帅，走群众路线，在当前的各项工作中要与党内外的右倾保守思想作斗争。各校党委要在一面抓教学、科学研究的同时，一面抓经济生产，认真地贯彻勤俭办学的方针。学校的经济工作同样要实行群众路线，发动群众讨论学校的经济计划和预算。在办工厂、办农场、科学研究等项工作上要认真实行全面大协作，反对本位主义。
    会议讨论了工厂、农村以及中小学教育如何贯彻党的教育方针，指出在工厂办的业余学校里要迅速的结合工厂生产实际进行教育改革，特别是数理化等课，应该多利用工厂生产实际中的问题讲解。
