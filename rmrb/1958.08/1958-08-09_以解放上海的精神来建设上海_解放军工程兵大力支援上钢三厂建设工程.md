Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 8th: The heroic People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps, which liberated Shanghai nine years ago, is once again making significant contributions to the construction of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. In just over a month, they completed more than 26,000 cubic meters of earthwork and nearly 8,000 cubic meters of concrete pouring, enabling the factory to go into production ahead of schedule on October 1st.

This engineering corps, which participated in the liberation of Shanghai nine years ago, arrived at the construction site of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 on June 15th. On that day, the officers and soldiers carried huge banners to participate in the construction mobilization meeting. The banners read, "Build Shanghai with the attitude of liberating and defending Shanghai," and "Use our sweat to exchange for molten steel," expressing their bold aspirations. Subsequently, they worked day and night to fulfill their oaths with practical actions. Over the past month, they have been racing against time. When repairing a car, repairman Chen Chaolin's hand was caught, and he fainted on the spot. After waking up and bandaging it briefly, he immediately resumed work. When the instructor asked him to go home to rest, he refused. He said, "On the battlefield, one doesn't leave the front line with minor injuries. What does this small problem of mine count for?" When there were not enough mixing machine operators, some of them automatically worked continuously for twenty-four hours next to the machine room. Communist Party member Xie Wanshuang, while rescuing cement in the pouring rain, was stabbed in the foot by a nail. Fearing that the cement would get wet, he insisted on delivering the cement before pulling out the nail, bandaging it simply, and then went back to rescue the cement. Yu Zaijie, the squad leader of the Ninth Squad, and soldier Chen Baosan became ill. The platoon leader left them at home to rest. But in less than twenty minutes, they went back to the construction site. When the platoon leader reprimanded them, they said: "Just let us work! In order to produce steel as soon as possible and catch up with England."

Under the selfless labor spirit of the soldiers, new records continued to emerge. For example, in the digging of the rough foundation, the output increased from three cubic meters per person per day to eight cubic meters. Later, Ji Changyu of the First Squad created an even higher record of sixteen cubic meters per person per day. The Ninth Squad's manual mixing achieved 2.6 cubic meters per hour, creating a situation where manual mixing exceeded the efficiency of mechanical mixing. The high-altitude work of the Third Squad completed the task five days ahead of schedule and ensured quality. In the past, the wasteland was uneven, full of sewage ditches and coal slag. Now, the prototypes of open-hearth furnaces, converters, and medium plate workshops have emerged.

### 以解放上海的精神来建设上海  解放军工程兵大力支援上钢三厂建设工程

    以解放上海的精神来建设上海
    解放军工程兵大力支援上钢三厂建设工程
    新华社上海8日电  当年解放上海的英雄——中国人民解放军工程兵部队，今天又在支援上钢三厂的建设中作出了重大贡献。一个多月内，他们完成了二万六千多土方，混凝土浇灌将近八千多立方公尺，使这座工厂将提前在10月1日投入生产。
    这支九年前参加解放上海战斗的工程兵部队是在6月15日开来上钢三厂工地的。这天，官兵们扛着巨型标语牌参加了施工誓师大会。标语牌上写着“以解放上海保卫上海的姿态来建设上海”、“用我们的汗水换钢水”等豪言壮语。接着，他们就不分昼夜地用实际行动实现自己的誓言。一个多月来，他们分秒必争。修理工陈超林在修理汽车时，手被夹住了，当时就昏了过去，醒来后，稍事包扎，马上又干起来。指导员要他回家休息，他说啥也不回去。他说，战场上轻伤不下火线，我这一点小毛病算什么。拌合机手不够，有的就自动在机械房边连续工作二十四小时。共产党员谢万双，在倾盆大雨里抢救洋灰时，被钉子扎了脚，他却怕洋灰淋湿，坚持把洋灰送到，才拔掉钉子，简单包扎以后，又去抢救洋灰。九中队班长于在杰，战士陈宝三生了病，排长留他们在家里休息。但不到二十分钟，他们就又到工地上去了。排长责备他们，他们便说：你就让我们干吧！为了早日出钢，早日赶上英国。
    在战士们这种忘我的劳动精神下，新纪录不断出现。像打毛基挖土方，从开始每人每天三立方提高到八立方，后来一中队季昌玉创造了每人每天十六立方的更高纪录。九中队的人工拌合，一小时拌二点六立方，创造了人工拌合超过了机械拌合效率。三中队的高空作业，提前五天完成了任务，并保证了质量。过去高低不平，到处是污水沟，煤渣的荒地上，现在已出现了平炉、转炉、中板车间的雏形。
