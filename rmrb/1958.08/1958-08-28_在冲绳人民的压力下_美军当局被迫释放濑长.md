　　Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Tokyo dispatch: Under the resolute struggle of the Okinawan people, the U.S. military occupation authorities in Okinawa were forced to release Senaga Kamejiro, chairman of the Okinawa "League for the Defense of Democracy," on the 25th, whom they had illegally arrested.
　　The former mayor of Naha, who opposes the permanent U.S. occupation of Okinawa, told reporters after his release that the release demonstrates the power of the people to resist the United States. Senaga stated that he will continue to carry out vigorous activities for the welfare of the residents of Okinawa Island in the future.
　　In order to persecute the democratic forces in Okinawa, the U.S. authorities exerted pressure from all sides last November to remove Senaga from his post as mayor of Naha. In March of this year, under the pretext of "engaging in activities of an unregistered political party," they instructed the Okinawa Prosecutor's Office to file a lawsuit against Senaga Kamejiro and others, and later illegally arrested Senaga.

　　在冲绳人民的压力下
    美军当局被迫释放濑长
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：在冲绳人民坚决斗争下，冲绳美军占领当局被迫在25日释放了被它非法逮捕的冲绳“拥护民主主义联络协议会”议长濑长龟次郎。
    这位反对美国永久占领冲绳的前那霸市长在被释后向记者发表谈话说，这次释放显示了人民对美国进行抵抗的力量。濑长表示，为了冲绳岛居民的福利，他今后将继续展开强有力的活动。
    美国当局为了迫害冲绳的民主力量，曾经在去年11月从各方面施加压力，解除了濑长的那霸市长职务。今年3月，又以“曾经从事没有登记的政党的活动”为借口，指使冲绳检察厅对濑长龟次郎等人提起诉讼，后来又非法逮捕了濑长。
