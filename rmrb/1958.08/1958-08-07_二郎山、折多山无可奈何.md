Erlang Mountain and Zheduo Mountain Helpless

He Yingkuan, a young driver of the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Team of the state-owned Sichuan Ya'an Transportation Company, used facts to shatter the conservative thinking that the Kangzang Highway was too mountainous, had slopes that were too steep, turns that were too sharp, roads that were too slippery, and could not support motor vehicle trains. On July 15, He Yingkuan drove a five-ton truck, towing a three-and-a-half-ton trailer, departing from Ya'an, crossing Erlang Mountain, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and Zheduo Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, arriving safely at Daofu. On July 19, he departed from Daofu again with a three-ton trailer and returned to Ya'an on the 21st. The round trip was a total of 864 kilometers, increasing transport capacity by 60%, saving fuel by 17.25%, and without any accidents along the way. The Ya'an Transportation Company has decided to manufacture trailers in large quantities, striving to have 60% of the vehicles on the Kangzang Highway towing trailers within the year.

    二郎山、折多山无可奈何
    国营四川省雅安运输公司汽车一队青年司机何应宽，用事实打破了康藏公路山大、坡陡、弯急、路滑、不能实现汽车列车化的保守思想。7月15日，何应宽驾驶一辆载重五吨的汽车，挂一辆载重三吨半的拖车，从雅安出发，越过拔海三千多公尺的二郎山和拔海四千多公尺的折多山，平安到达道孚。7月19日，又从道孚挂一辆载重三吨的拖车启程，在21日返抵雅安。这次往返共八百六十四公里，增加运量60％，节约油料17.25％，全程无任何事故。雅安运输公司已决定大量制造拖车，争取年内有60％的汽车都在康藏公路上挂上拖车行驶。
