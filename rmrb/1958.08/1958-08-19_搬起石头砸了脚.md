　　Lifting a Rock Only to Drop it on One's Own Feet

    "Work-study programs have lowered the quality of education," some teachers with bourgeois educational ideas have been constantly chattering since the implementation of work-study programs in schools. A few "educators" try every possible means, even unscrupulous ones, to attack it. Some individuals even resort to their last trump card, trying to fail students in exams to prove that their fallacies are not fallacies. Here is a vivid example: Wang Wei, a lecturer in the Chemistry Department of Lanzhou University, took advantage of an exam opportunity to deliberately give students difficult problems. The questions were numerous and in-depth, and the time limit was short. As a result, 62.5% of the papers failed. So, he clamored that "work-study programs have lowered the quality of education!" The students were very dissatisfied with Wang Wei's deliberate exam and demanded that the teachers also take a test. As a result, none of them answered everything correctly, and even Mr. Wang Wei, who wrote and graded the test himself, only scored forty-five points. It was truly an embarrassing moment, and his bet was lost completely.
    Some people who shout that "work-study programs have lowered the quality of teaching" often put on a sanctimonious face, as if they are truly concerned about the quality of learning, for the sake of the next generation, and are "uncompromising" teachers. In fact, they are just stubborn elements who refuse to abandon bourgeois teaching ideas. The so-called "lowering of teaching quality" is just a deceptive guise.
    Has the quality of education decreased or increased after the implementation of work-study programs? Take the Chemistry Department of Lanzhou University as an example. In the past, students could not prepare reagents without teachers, but after the implementation of work-study programs, they can now independently manufacture more than a dozen reagents that meet international standards, and they have also refined several rare metals together with young teaching assistants. The bourgeois experts and professors turn a deaf ear to these achievements. The content of what students learn in work-study programs is very rich. If those gentlemen who are divorced from production and reality were to test the students on what they have learned in work-study programs, the score would not be forty-five points, but zero.
    The combination of education and labor is a firm and unshakeable policy of socialist education and a revolution in school education. Through this revolution, our schools should thoroughly break away from the evils of bourgeois education, which is divorced from production, theory divorced from practice, and the separation of mental and manual labor, so that the three are closely combined, and intellectuals are working-class oriented, and workers and peasants are intellectualized. This is an ideological revolution of profound significance. Educators who resist ideological reform and oppose the policy of education serving production are essentially adhering to the bourgeois educational line and passively resisting or openly opposing the proletarian educational line. This struggle is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialist educational thought and bourgeois educational thought. Now, many schools have joined this struggle and have already won the first round of victory. Through this debate, many bourgeois intellectuals, forced by the general trend, have begun to admit defeat; but some die-hards are still stubbornly resisting. Education workers in our schools must maintain a high degree of vigilance, always hold high the red flag of the proletariat, persist in implementing the policy of education serving production and combining education with labor, and give necessary blows to the evil winds and noxious influences stirred up by bourgeois experts and professors at any time.

    “勤工俭学降低了教育质量”，一些具有资产阶级教育思想的教师们，从学校实行勤工俭学以后就这样喋喋不休的议论。少数教育家千方百计地、不择手段地攻击它，甚至个别人不惜拿出最后的王牌，要把学生考倒，用以证明他们的谬论不谬。这里有这样一个活生生的例子：兰州大学化学系讲师王慰，借考试的机会，别有用心的给学生大出难题，题目多而深，限定时间短，结果62.5％的试卷不及格，于是他就吵吵嚷嚷的说：“勤工俭学降低了教育质量”呀！对于王慰这种别有用心的考试，学生很不服气，他们要求老师也来考一考。结果他们也没有一个人完全答对，甚至连亲手出题目而又改过卷子的王慰先生也只得了个四十五分。真是当场出丑，他的赌注输得精光了。
    一些高喊“勤工俭学降低了教学质量”的人，往往伪装出一副道貌岸然的面孔，好像他们关心的真是学习质量，是为了下一代，是一个“不折不扣”的教师。其实他们不过是死不肯放弃资产阶级教学思想的顽固分子而已。所谓“降低教学质量”的说法，都是欺人的幌子。
    勤工俭学后的教育质量是降低了还是提高了呢？就以兰州大学化学系来说，过去学生连配试剂也离不开教师，实行勤工俭学以后，现在他们却能独立制造出十几种达到国际水平的试剂，并且同青年助教一起提炼出好几种稀有金属。对于这些，那些资产阶级的专家教授先生们充耳不闻。学生在勤工俭学中学到的东西，内容十分丰富，如果要让那些脱离生产、脱离实际的先生们，来考一下学生在勤工俭学中所学的东西，那就不是四十五分，而是鸭蛋了。
    教育和劳动结合是社会主义教育的坚定不移的方针，也是学校教育的一个革命。通过这个革命，就是要使我们的学校彻底摆脱资产阶级教育脱离生产，理论脱离实际，劳心和劳力分离的恶果，使三者密切结合起来，使知识分子工农化，工农分子知识化。这是一个有深刻意义的思想革命。抗拒思想改造，反对教育为生产服务这一方针的教育家们，实质上是坚持资产阶级的教育路线，消极地抵制或公开的反抗无产阶级的教育路线。这种斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级，是社会主义教育思想同资产阶级教育思想的斗争。现在，许多学校已经投入这场斗争，并且已经取得第一个回合的胜利。通过这场论战，许多资产阶级知识分子迫于大势所趋，开始认输；但有些死硬分子仍然在负隅顽抗。我们学校的教育工作者，一定要保持高度的警惕，时时高举无产阶级的红旗，坚持贯彻执行教育为生产服务、教育和劳动相结合的方针，并随时给予资产阶级的专家教授们掀起的妖风邪气以必要的打击。
