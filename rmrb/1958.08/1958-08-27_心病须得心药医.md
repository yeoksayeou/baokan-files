A Heart-to-Heart Talk

　　Mental Illness Requires Mental Medicine

Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Qiwen is a demobilized soldier who used to work at the Yangxian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaanxi and is now working in the countryside for labor training. For the past few years, Comrade Zhang Qiwen has been carrying a burden: he always feels that he has not learned specialized business skills in his work and complains that the leadership does not care about or cultivate him politically or professionally. Because he got stuck in the horns of individualism, he even quit the Communist Youth League. Now, in the context of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, he has realized that he cannot keep up with the times while carrying ideological baggage, so he wrote to Comrade Xie Juezai, hoping to help solve his ideological problems. In the following letter, Comrade Xie Juezai pointed out sharply that Comrade Zhang Qiwen's ideological problem is a "mental illness," that he thinks too much about personal interests and too little about collective interests; he blames others too much and blames himself too little. He also pointed out that to cure this "mental illness," it is necessary to overcome individualism. We believe that this letter has universal educational significance and is worth reading carefully.

Comrade Zhang Qiwen:

　　I am not in Beijing, so I only saw your letter of July 1st today.

　　You said in your letter that you want me to help you solve your ideological problems. Help is possible and necessary, but the key to solving it is in your own hands, so it mainly depends on your own efforts.

　　Your ideological problem is a "mental illness." As the old saying goes, "Mental illness requires mental medicine." I can prescribe a prescription, but you have to pick, prepare, and use the medicine yourself. You said that the leadership's analysis and explanation of you either did not address the root cause or the medicine was not strong enough. This may be the case, but you cannot blame the leadership, you should blame yourself.

　　"Mental illness" does not mean that the physical heart is sick, but that there is a problem with your thinking. According to your letter, your "mental illness" is: first, you think too much about personal interests and too little about the interests of the collective and the people; second, you blame others too much and blame yourself too little. Therefore, you increasingly feel that the circle in front of you is too narrow and there is nothing to do; you increasingly feel that people are not warm to you and you have become a lonely person. As a result, you feel depressed: you can't read books and you don't have the energy to do things. But you should know that this trap was dug by yourself. You must fill in what you dug yourself. The way to fill it in is to reverse what you did before. You should think less about personal interests, or even not think about them, and mainly think about the interests of the collective and the people. Personal interests are consistent with the interests of the collective and the people. Don't complain about others, you should complain about yourself. If you complain about others, what will be the result if they ignore you? If you complain about yourself, it is to encourage yourself. "Musk naturally smells fragrant," and people will come to care about you, and necessary help will be easily obtained.

　　In this way, your situation will change greatly. To put it theoretically: it is to break the bourgeois individualist outlook on life and enter the proletarian collectivist outlook on life. That is, to pass the test of socialism.

　　Passing the test of socialism is not that difficult. For example, you have been sent to the countryside. The countryside in Shaanxi, like the rest of the country, is undergoing a great leap forward in agriculture, industry, mining, and education, with "one day equaling twenty years." They are changing or are changing the face of nature, and many people with both red and expert qualities have emerged. Are they all more "specialized" than you? No. Did they all succeed after the leadership talked to them? No. Your letter did not mention these things, not because they don't exist in Shaanxi, or in Yangxian, but because you have the two problems mentioned above in your mind (thinking too much about your own interests and blaming others too much), so the things in front of you cannot arouse your interest and attention.

　　It should be pointed out that you said that your leaders did not talk to you, did not cultivate you to learn a specialty, and did not listen carefully to your work reports. This may be a noteworthy thing. But for you, if you have complaints, it should be because your work has indeed achieved results but has been obliterated by the leadership, or you have put forward very good opinions that have not been adopted. - However, even in this case, you can avoid complaining, you should explain the reasons in detail and continue to prove in practice whether your opinions are correct and completely correct. Unfortunately, you are not like this.

　　It's not a big deal that the production subsidy is a month late. "It was reissued later." "This is where I am very unhappy ideologically." It may be because you feel that you are a member of the Communist Youth League and you are arguing about these few yuan, which is too calculating, and therefore you are unhappy. Then you should not care about personal interests so much in the future.

　　You like my short article "Opening Up Your Heart". The article says to hand over the bad heart, destroy it in public, and then install the good heart. I hope you can do this, and you will definitely be able to do it. When you had a conflict with the squad leader in the army, after the deputy platoon leader's criticism, you realized that you were a young man, why should you ask others to help you? Don't you have the courage to take on all the work yourself? Now you are still a young man, why should people say that you are "lacking in virtue and talent"? Can't you cheer up, "compete in vigor and strive to be upstream," and become an active member again in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction? To say it again: I hope you can do this.

　　You want to call me teacher, like Comrade Chen Changfeng. Let me tell you that Comrade Chen Changfeng's culture was self-taught. Maybe I said some words casually at the time, but the listener took them to heart, so he benefited endlessly. I can't say that every sentence in my letter is to your liking, but if there are a few sentences that you find useful, and you apply them to your specific actions, then I am very happy.

　　Denying your own narrow, biased, and low-level interests, and moving to a higher place, is the most pleasant thing.

　　I won't write anymore, I wish you progress!

专栏：谈心书

　　心病须得心药医
    编者按：张启文同志是一个复员军人，原在陕西洋县供销社工作，现在下放到农村劳动锻炼。几年来，张启文同志一直背着一个包袱：总觉得自己在工作中没有学到专门的业务技能，埋怨领导上对他政治上、业务上不关心、不培养。因为钻进了个人主义的牛角尖，他甚至退出了共青团。现在，在全国大跃进的形势下，他已觉悟到背着思想包袱是无法赶上时代的，因而写信给谢觉哉同志，希望帮助解决思想问题。谢觉哉同志在下面这封复信里，一针见血地指出了张启文同志的思想问题是“心病”，是个人利益想的太多，集体利益想得太少；责备别人的方面太多，责备自己的方面太少。并指出要治这种“心病”，必需克服个人主义。我们认为这封信有普遍教育意义，值得大家仔细阅读。张启文同志：
    我不在京，你7月1日的信今天才看到。
    你信上说：要我帮助你解决思想问题，帮助是可以的也是应该的，但解决的钥匙，握在你自己手里，因此主要要靠你自己努力。
    你的思想问题是“心病”，老话说：“心病须得心药医”，我可以开出药方子，但药要你自己拣、自己配、自己使用。你说领导对你的分析和解释，不是没有对症下药就是药下得不够，可能是这样，但这不能怪领导，应该怪自己。
    “心病”，不是说肉体的心脏有病而是说思想上有病，照来信看，你的“心病”：一是个人利益想得太多，集体的人民的利益想得太少；二是责备别人的方面想得太多，责备自己的方面想得太少。因此你越来越感到你自己面前的圈子太窄了，没有甚么可作了；越来越感到人们对你不亲热了，成为孤单的人了。因而心里愁闷：看书看不进去，做事没有劲头。但应该知道，这个陷井是你自己挖的。自己挖的必须自己填。填的法子是把以前的倒过来。个人的利益要想得少甚至不想，主要应该是想集体的人民的利益。个人利益是和集体的人民的利益一致的。不要埋怨人家了，应该埋怨自己，埋怨人家，人家不理你，有什么结果？埋怨自己，也即是策励自己，“有麝自然香”，人也就会来理你了，必要的帮助也易于得到。
    这样，你的情况就会大大变样。提高到理论上说：是打破资产阶级个人主义的人生观进到无产阶级集体主义的人生观。也即是过社会主义的关。
    过社会主义的关，并不那样难。比如你下放到了农村，陕西的农村和全国一样，正在掀起农、工、矿、学等事业的大跃进，“一天等于二十年”；他们改变或正在改变大自然的面貌，出了许多又红又专的人才，难道他们都比你“学有专长”吗，没有；都经过领导上找他谈话才成功的吗？不是。你的来信没有提到这些，不是你陕西没有，你洋县没有，而是你脑子里横着上面说的两个毛病（想自己利益多，责备别人多），因而眼前的事，引不起你的兴趣和注意。
    应该指出：你说你的领导没有找你谈话，没有培养你学专长，没有好好听你的工作汇报，这可能是值得注意的事。但在你，如果有牢骚的话，应该是你的工作确实有成绩而被领导抹杀，或者提了很好的意见，没有被采纳。——不过，即是这样，也可以不发牢骚，应该详细说明理由并继续在实际工作中证明你的意见是否正确和是否完全正确。可惜，你都不是这样。
    生产资助金差一个月，不是什么大事。“后来又补发了”，“这是对我思想上很不高兴的地方”，可能是你觉得自己是一个共青团员，争着这几元钱，太算细了，因而不高兴。那你以后对个人利益，不这样丝毫计较就得了。
    你喜欢我那篇“交心”的短文，文上说把不好的心交出来，当众毁掉，随即把好的心安上去。我希望你能这样，你也一定能这样。你在队伍里和班长闹别扭的时候，经过副排长的批评，你认识到自己是一个青年，为什么要叫别人帮助，自己就没有勇气把一切工作担当起来吗？现在你还是一个青年，为什么要让人家说你“缺德少才”，自己就不能振作起来，“比干劲、争上游”，在社会主义建设事业大跃进中，从新做一个积极分子呢？重说一遍：我希望你能这样。
    你想和陈昌奉同志一样，叫我一声老师。告诉你，陈昌奉同志的文化是自己学的，可能当时我说过一些话，说的人是随便，听的人用了心，因而他就受用不尽。我不能说我的信每句话都合你的口味，但如有几句你觉得有益，把他运用到你具体的行动里，那我是很高兴的。
    否定自己狭隘的、偏私的、低级趣味的东西，进到高一步的地方去，是最愉快不过的事。
    不写了，祝你进步！
