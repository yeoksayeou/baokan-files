　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st: TASS, Moscow, August 21st: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, replied on August 16th to a letter received at the end of July signed by over three hundred British artists and critics. In that letter, they appealed to the governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States to immediately halt the testing, stockpiling, and production of nuclear weapons.

　　In his reply, Khrushchev mentioned that the Soviet Union had already ceased testing nuclear weapons and called on the U.S. and Britain to follow the Soviet Union's example. He emphasized that the Soviet government never intended to limit disarmament measures to merely ceasing the testing of nuclear weapons. Khrushchev's reply stated that, as indicated in numerous official documents, the Soviet disarmament proposals stipulate, in addition to ceasing the testing, stockpiling, and production of nuclear weapons, the complete prohibition of such weapons and the elimination and destruction of their stockpiles from the armaments of all countries. Khrushchev wrote, "You see, the Soviet government's proposals on nuclear disarmament go beyond your demands. We believe that only by condemning and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons can the danger of nuclear war be eliminated, and only then can the more tragic events than those that occurred in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan be prevented from recurring."

　　Khrushchev pointed out that the United States continues to conduct an unprecedentedly intense series of nuclear tests in the Pacific, and Britain is also conducting experimental explosions of nuclear weapons as usual. At the same time, according to some reports, the governments of these countries are still planning new tests. Khrushchev wrote, "Obviously, Washington and London do not want to stop these dangerous tests, which cannot but be a matter of great regret."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st: According to TASS, Moscow, August 20th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko wrote a letter to the Presidium of the European Conference of Trade Unions and Workers Against the Threat of Atomic War, for Disarmament and Peace, stating that the entire course of events in recent times proves that there is an urgent need to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons and to take other urgent measures in the field of disarmament.

　　Gromyko said that the arms race and "Cold War" policy pursued by Western countries have turned the world into a powder keg that could explode at any time. The interference of the United States and Britain in the internal affairs of Arab countries has increased the threat of atomic war. Precisely for this reason, it is now even more important to stop the dangerous development of events, to achieve practical results in disarmament, and to take the universal cessation of nuclear testing as an urgent first step. Unfortunately, after the Soviet Union unilaterally ceased nuclear testing, there is no indication that the United States and Britain are willing to stop nuclear testing in the same way.

　　Gromyko pointed out that in order to speed up the solution of the problem of universal cessation of nuclear testing, the Soviet Union agreed to participate in the Geneva Conference of Experts. The outcome of this conference will depend on the extent to which it can guarantee that the countries concerned reach an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. He said that if the conference does not achieve this goal, then the expectations of all mankind, who earnestly hope that the United States and Britain will stop testing nuclear weapons after the Soviet Union, will suffer a serious blow.

　　Gromyko's letter was a reply to an open letter to the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union from the European Conference of Trade Unions and Workers Against the Threat of Atomic War, for Disarmament and Peace, held in Berlin in June this year. The open letter called on the United States and Britain to stop nuclear testing and called on the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement quickly on the immediate, universal, and supervised cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

### 赫鲁晓夫复信英国文化艺术界人士  核武器必须彻底禁止  葛罗米柯指责美英不停止核试验

　　赫鲁晓夫复信英国文化艺术界人士
    核武器必须彻底禁止
    葛罗米柯指责美英不停止核试验
    新华社21日讯  塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫8月16日对7月底收到的有三百多名英国艺术家和批评家签名的信作了答复。他们在那封信中曾呼吁英国、苏联和美国三国政府立即停止试验、储存和生产核武器。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中提到，苏联已经停止了试验核武器，呼吁美英两国效法苏联。他强调指出，苏联政府从来不打算把裁军的措施局限于停止试验核武器。赫鲁晓夫的复信说，正如在许多正式文件中所表明的那样，苏联的裁军建议规定除了停止试验、储存和生产核武器之外，还要求彻底禁止这类武器，并且从各国军备中取缔和销毁这类武器的储备。赫鲁晓夫写道，你们看，苏联政府关于核裁军的建议超出了你们的要求。我们认为，只有谴责并禁止原子武器和氢武器，才能消除核战争的危险，也才能使得比在日本的广岛和长崎发生的更为悲惨的事件不致重演。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国继续在太平洋空前紧张地进行一系列核试验，英国也照常在进行核武器的试验性爆炸，同时，从一些消息看来，这些国家的政府还在计划进行新的试验。赫鲁晓夫写道，显然，华盛顿和伦敦都不想停止这种危险的试验，这点不能不令人感到莫大的遗憾。
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯写信给欧洲各国工会和工人反对原子战争威胁、争取裁军与和平代表会议主席团说，最近时期事态发展的整个进程证明，迫切需要停止原子武器和氢武器试验，并且在裁军方面采取其他刻不容缓的措施。
    葛罗米柯说，西方国家所实行的军备竞赛和“冷战”政策把世界变成了随时都可能爆炸的火药库。美、英两国对阿拉伯国家内政的干涉加剧了原子战争的威胁。正因为如此，制止事态的危险发展、在裁军方面取得实际结果并且把普遍停止核试验作为刻不容缓的第一个步骤，现在就更加重要了。遗憾的是，在苏联单方面停止核试验以后，毫无迹象可以说明美国和英国愿意同样停止核试验。
    葛罗米柯指出，为了加速解决普遍停止核试验的问题，苏联同意参加日内瓦专家会议。这次会议的结果如何将取决于能够在多大程度上保证有关各国达成停止核武器试验的协议。他说，如果会议达不到这个目的，那末，殷切希望美、英两国继苏联之后停止试验核武器的全人类的期望就会受到严重的打击。
    葛罗米柯这封信是对今年6月间在柏林举行的欧洲各国工会和工人反对原子战争威胁、争取裁军与和平代表会议给美、英、苏三国政府的公开信的答复。公开信曾经要求美英两国停止核试验，并且要求美、英、苏三国就立即普遍地、有监督地停止核武器试验的问题迅速达成协议。
