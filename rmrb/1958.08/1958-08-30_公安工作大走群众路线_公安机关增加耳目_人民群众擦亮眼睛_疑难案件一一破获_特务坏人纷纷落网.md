　　Public Security Work Extensively Follows the Mass Line
    Public Security Organs Increase Eyes and Ears; The People Sharpen Their Vision; Difficult Cases are Solved One by One; Special Agents and Bad People are Caught One After Another
    (Our newspaper's reporter Gong Ce reports) Amidst the Great Leap Forward of the whole people, new innovations have emerged in public security work in various regions—using methods of mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, put up big-character posters, and engage in big debates to conduct investigation and solve cases, achieving significant results. Utilizing such methods of speaking out and debating represents a new development in public security work implementing the mass line.
    Through the Rectification Movement, public security personnel in various regions have fully focused on relying on the masses to carry out work, further overcoming the remaining isolated thinking in investigation and case-solving. They have liberated their thinking and created new working methods, publicizing the details of certain unsolved cases, mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate, allowing the masses to provide information and methods, and on this basis, strengthening the specialized work of public security organs. This has led to rapid and effective achievements in investigation and case-solving, cracking down on current criminals, digging out remaining enemies, and reforming bad people, presenting a new situation of leap forward in public security work. According to the specific circumstances of various cases, the public security organs of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, have adopted various effective working methods. For example, in some cases, the public security organs publicize the details to the masses, extensively mobilizing the masses to provide clues; some cases are handled through public exposure, criticism, and struggle by the masses; in some cases, the public security organs lead the masses to put up big-character posters for exposure; some absorb activists to participate in case-solving teams to jointly solve cases. Regarding reactionary slogans, the public security departments generally organize the masses to visit for identification, launching discussions. This, on the one hand, educates the masses and raises their vigilance, and at the same time, quickly obtains reliable clues. Therefore, the case-solving rate in Tangshan City has greatly increased in the first five months of this year, with the average case-solving rate for criminal cases increasing by more than 41% compared with the same period last year. Recently, Shijiazhuang City in the same province, based on mass reporting and exposure, and combined with publicizing case details, organizing symposiums, debates, investigations, and verification, launched a vigorous case-solving offensive. In half a month, it cracked down on a batch of various cases, sweeping away old and new cases in three districts of the city. In the summer of this year, Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, mobilized the masses to put up big-character posters, and the public security organs received a large number of valuable materials exposing counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. A Kuomintang secret service group leader who had been hiding for many years felt he had nowhere to hide under the power of the big-character posters, and he was forced to confess in front of the big-character posters. A major bandit leader who murdered four of our cadres and masses also surrendered to the public security organs under the power of the masses and confessed to his crimes. In Jinan City, a case of posting reactionary slogans in the Department Store, which had not been solved after more than a year of investigation, was solved on the same day after the reactionary slogans were publicized to the masses, with employees writing more than a thousand big-character posters, and the perpetrator had no choice but to confess his crimes in full view of the public. In Guangzhou City, the Shahe Police Station solved a case of posting reactionary slogans in 1956. Recently, the public security cadres, through mobilizing the masses to visit the scene and put up big-character posters, solved the case in eighteen hours.
    The practice of publicizing case details to the masses and mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate not only invisibly adds countless eyes and ears to the public security organs but also sharpens the eyes of the masses and provides them with a vivid education in revolutionary vigilance. In a factory in Taiyuan, two anonymous threatening letters were received in December last year, and the factory's security department could not solve the case for a long time. Later, the threatening letters were handed over to the masses for discussion and handwriting identification. At that time, a flatcar worker took the letter to the security cadre to report, and the case was immediately solved. The members of the Chunxia Agricultural Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, were stolen 187 yuan in the middle of the night on March 30 this year while preventing frost. After the incident, the cooperative immediately convened a mass meeting, announced the case details, and mobilized the masses to expose and debate. On the spot, fifteen-year-old Shao Baosuo debated with Guo Xiaohuang, saying, "You and I were together during frost prevention, but I don't know where you went halfway. You said you went the wrong way. You have lived here for thirty years. How can you say you went the wrong way?" This debate left Guo Xiaohuang dumbfounded and unable to answer. After the meeting, Guo Xiaohuang immediately confessed his crime to the party branch secretary and handed over all the stolen money.
    There are many such vivid examples. In Guangzhou City, there was a case of posting reactionary slogans that was solved in one hour; in Lanzhou Health School in Gansu Province, a difficult murder case was solved in seventeen and a half hours; in Guiyang City, a cunning major criminal who had committed theft, robbery, abduction, and fraud more than three hundred times was recently forced to surrender after being exposed by the masses; in Jinan City, a Kuomintang secret agent who had been hiding for eight years was recently caught by the masses themselves from a secret room. All these situations prove that in public security work, truly believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and thoroughly implementing the mass line will inevitably greatly enhance the power of the dictatorship and create a new situation in public security work. If a small number of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements do not surrender and do not accept transformation and still dare to carry out sabotage activities, no matter how cunning they are, they will not escape the net of the people's law.

　　公安工作大走群众路线
    公安机关增加耳目　人民群众擦亮眼睛  疑难案件一一破获　特务坏人纷纷落网
    本报讯　记者宫策报道：在全民大跃进中，各地公安工作出现了新的创举——用发动群众大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的方法进行侦察破案，收到了重大的成效。运用这种鸣放辩论的方法，是公安工作贯彻群众路线的新的发展。
    经过整风运动，各地公安人员充分注意了依靠群众来进行工作，进一步克服了侦察破案中的孤立主义的思想残余。他们解放了思想，创造了新的工作方法，将未破获的某些案件实行公布案情，发动群众鸣放辩论，由群众提供情况，提供办法，并在这个基础上加强公安机关的专门工作，这就在侦察破案、打击现行犯、挖掘残敌、改造坏人等方面，又快又好地取得了成绩，出现了公安工作跃进的新局面。河北省唐山市公安机关根据各种案件的具体情况，采取了各种有效的工作方法，例如有的案件，公安机关向群众公布案情，广泛地发动群众提供线索；有的通过群众公开进行揭发、批判和斗争；有的案件公安机关有领导地发动群众贴大字报进行揭发；有的吸收积极分子参加破案小组，共同破案；对于反动标语，公安部门一般都组织群众参观辨认，发动讨论，这样一方面教育群众提高了警惕，同时很快就获得了可靠的线索。因此，唐山市今年头五个月内破案率大大提高，其中刑事案件的平均破案率比去年同期提高了41％以上。这个省的石家庄市，最近在群众鸣放检举的基础上，公安机关根据揭发的材料，结合公布案情，组织座谈辩论、调查对证，展开了一个轰轰烈烈的破案攻势，半个月内一举破获了一批各种案件，市内有三个区的新旧案件一扫而光。贵州省贵阳市在今年夏天，发动群众大贴大字报，公安机关收到了大量检举反革命分子和坏分子的有价值的材料。有一个潜伏多年的军统特务组长在大字报的威力下，感到无处藏身，他在大字报的面前被迫坦白交代。有一个杀害我干部、群众四人的大匪首，也在群众的威力下投案自首，交代了自己的罪行。济南市百货大楼一件贴反动标语案，经过一年多侦察，没有破案，这次向群众公布了反动标语，当天职工就写了一千多张大字报，作案分子在众目睽睽之下，不得不供认犯罪事实。广州市沙河派出所辖区在1956年发生了一宗贴反动标语案，最近公安干部通过发动群众看现场、贴大字报的办法，结果十八个小时就破了案。
    采取向群众公布案情并发动群众鸣放辩论的作法，不仅无形中给公安机关增加了千千万万的耳目，而且使群众擦亮了眼睛，受到了生动的革命警惕性的教育。太原一个工厂在去年12月发生了两起匿名恐吓信案件，工厂保卫部门很长时间没有破案，后来把恐吓信交给群众讨论和辨认字迹，当时就有一平车工人拿着信向保卫干部检举，随即破案。山西省阳城县春霞农业社的社员们，今年3月30日深夜在进行防霜时，社里被盗一百八十七元。案件发生后，社里当即召开群众大会，公布案情，发动群众揭发和辩论，当场就有十五岁的少年保锁同郭小荒辩论，保锁说：“防霜时咱俩一路，到半路不知你上那去了，你说你走错了路，你在这里活了三十岁，怎能说走错了路呢？”这一辩论使郭小荒目瞪口呆，无言答对。会后，郭小荒马上找党的支部书记交代了犯罪经过，并交出全部赃款。
    这样生动的事例很多。在广州市有一小时破获一起贴反动标语案的事情；在甘肃省的兰州卫生学校里曾经用十七个半小时侦破了一件疑难的命案；贵阳市有一个偷、抢、拐、骗达三百多次的狡猾的大刑事犯，最近在群众的揭发下被迫投案；在济南市，有一个潜伏了八年的中统特务，最近被群众亲自动手从暗室中抓了出来。所有这些情况都证明，在公安工作中真正相信了群众，依靠群众，彻底地贯彻了群众路线，就必然大大地增强了专政的威力，使公安工作出现新的局面。如果少数反革命分子和坏分子不投案自首，不接受改造，仍然敢于进行破坏活动，不管他如何狡猾，都逃不出人民的法网。
