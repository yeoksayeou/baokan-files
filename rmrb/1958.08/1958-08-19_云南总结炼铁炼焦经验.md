Break Through Technical Barriers to Enable Normal Production of Small Blast Furnaces
Yunnan Sums Up Iron Smelting and Coking Experiences

According to the Yunnan Daily, the Yunnan Provincial Metallurgical Bureau recently convened a provincial on-site iron smelting conference in Eshan and Rongfeng counties to exchange experiences in brown coal semi-coking, semi-coke iron smelting, and taphole iron production in indigenous furnaces.

A province-wide upsurge in running iron and steel by the whole party and all the people has been set off in Yunnan. However, many regions have found that the indigenous furnaces that have already been built either cannot produce iron or only do so intermittently. In addition, Yunnan Province's coking coal resources are too concentrated, which is not compatible with the widespread development of the iron and steel industry. Therefore, grasping the solution of technical problems in iron smelting and promoting brown coal semi-coking has become a major issue in promoting a leap forward in steel production.

The on-site meeting analyzed in detail the lessons learned from the "death" and "resurrection" of the iron smelting furnace at the Eshan Dayutang Iron Smelting Plant, combined with an analysis of the iron production experience in Fuyuan and other regions, as well as the lessons learned from the failure to produce iron in other regions. The meeting believes that attention must be paid to the following aspects:

First, furnaces should be built on dry ground and have simple furnace sheds. The indigenous furnaces that have been built generally lack sheds and covers, or are located in low-lying areas. Once it rains, rainwater penetrates, lowering the furnace temperature and causing it to freeze. When building indigenous furnaces, first build the inside of the furnace body, and then surround it with soil on the outside to make it stronger. The soil surrounding the furnace body must be compacted to avoid cracking and air leakage. The inclination angle of the furnace waist and furnace belly should be adjusted appropriately according to the air blowing capacity, fuel, and ore properties, otherwise the furnace charge will either drop too quickly, forming cold charge, or form a "bridge." The connection angle between the air duct and the air belt should be large to avoid excessive loss of air volume. When using a circular hearth, there should be at least two tuyeres to ensure even heat.

Second, the fuel must be dry and the particle size must be graded. When the composition and properties of the ore change, the fuel must be increased or decreased accordingly to avoid improper fuel use, which will affect the normal combustion of the furnace.

Third, the air blowing and power equipment should be compatible with the furnace volume, and the air power should be sufficient and the air pressure should be high. Manual bellows must deliver air evenly and not intermittently. This is a key measure to increase production.

Fourth, when preparing the charge, the ore is best roasted first to ensure good air permeability; at the same time, because the hearth of the indigenous furnace is small, the particles should not be too large to facilitate reduction. The soil and impurities in the ore must be carefully removed to avoid excessive consumption of flux and fuel and to reduce production.

Fifth, the operating procedures must be strictly followed. The charge must be added according to the prescribed burden line and distributed evenly so that the charge maintains the necessary preheating time and drops evenly. The slag must be removed frequently to keep the tuyeres clear.

Sixth, a necessary production management system should be gradually established, including a shift system, responsibility system, and economic accounting system.

In order to ensure that the above measures are effectively implemented, the meeting believes that the industrial sector should guide the overall situation by conducting experimental plots, making breakthroughs at one point, and creating experience.

In solving the fuel problem, Eshan, Lincang, Lijiang, Chuxiong and other districts (autonomous prefectures) introduced their experiences in using brown coal for semi-coking. According to the characteristics of low fixed carbon and poor mechanical strength of brown coal, Lincang adopted small kilns of about one ton, and correctly grasped the air volume. The recovery rate of brown coal coking is generally 35%-40%. Eshan Dayutang used semi-coke 45%, coke 33%, and firewood 22% as fuel, and the quality of the iron produced was good, exactly the same as iron smelted with charcoal and coke. At the meeting, the Zhaotong representative introduced their successful experience in using 100% anthracite coal for iron smelting. Everyone believes that the above experience has opened up broad prospects for solving the current iron smelting fuel problem, and they all expressed that they would actively experiment and promote it when they returned.

### 云南总结炼铁炼焦经验

    突破技术关，让小高炉正常生产
　　云南总结炼铁炼焦经验
    据云南日报报道　云南省冶金局最近先后在峨山、榕峰两县召开了全省炼铁现场会议，交流了褐煤炼半焦、半焦炼铁、土炉出铁的经验。
    云南全省已掀起了全党全民办钢铁的热潮。但有不少地区已建的土炉出不了铁或出铁时断时续。此外，云南省焦煤资源过于集中，与钢铁工业遍地开花不相适应。因此，抓紧解决炼铁的技术问题和推广褐煤炼半焦，成为促使钢铁生产跃进的重大问题。
    现场会议详尽地分析了峨山大鱼塘炼铁厂炼铁炉“死”了又“活”的教训，结合分析了富源等部分地区出铁的经验以及其他地区出不了铁的教训。会议认为当前必须注意下述几方面的问题：
    首先，修建炉子要在干燥的地层上面，并有简单的炉棚。目前建成的土炉，由于普遍无棚、无盖，或是在低潮的地方，一旦下雨，雨水浸入，炉温降低，以致冻结。建土炉时，先建炉身内部，然后再在外面围土较为结实。炉身围土必须夯实，避免开裂漏风。炉腰炉腹倾斜角度要按照鼓风能力、燃料、矿石性质适当调整，否则不是炉料下降过快，形成冷料，就是形成“搭桥”现象。风管与风带联结角度要大，避免风量损失过多。用圆形炉缸时，风嘴至少在两个以上，以使火力均匀。
    第二，燃料要干燥，粒度要分级。矿石成分及性质变更时，燃料要作相应的增减，避免燃料使用不当，影响炉子正常燃烧。
    第三，鼓风与动力设备和炉子容积要相适应，风力要足，风压要大。人拉风箱要均匀送风，不能时断时续。这是提高产量的关键措施。
    第四，备料时，矿石最好先经焙烧，以便保证透气性良好；同时由于土炉炉缸较小，为了便于还原，颗粒不宜过大。矿石中的泥土、杂质必须认真剔出，以免多耗熔剂、燃料和降低产量。
    第五，要严格遵守操作方法，必须按照规定料线加料，均衡布料，以使炉料保持必要的预热时间及均衡下降。要勤出渣，经常保持风口通畅。
    第六，要逐步建立必要的生产管理制度，包括接班制、责任制、经济核算制等。
    为了保证上述措施得以切实贯彻，会议认为工业部门应通过搞试验田，突破一点，创造经验来指导全面。
    在解决燃料问题上，峨山、临沧、丽江、楚雄等专区（自治州）分别介绍了利用褐煤炼半焦的经验。临沧根据褐煤固定碳低、机械强度较差的特点，采用一吨左右的小型窑子，以及正确掌握风量，褐煤炼焦回收率一般在35％—40％。峨山大鱼塘利用半焦45％、焦炭33％、木柴22％做燃料，炼出的铁质量良好，跟木炭和焦炭炼出的铁完全一样。会上昭通代表介绍了他们利用100％无烟煤炼铁成功的经验。大家认为上述经验为解决当前炼铁燃料问题开辟了广阔的道路，都表示回去要积极试验推广。
