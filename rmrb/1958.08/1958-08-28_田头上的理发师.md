　　The Barber in the Fields
    In the great leap forward of socialist construction, the eight barbers in the barber cooperative group of Xiachejie Town, Guanyun County, have also been exerting their utmost efforts to strive for the top. In order to support agricultural production, they have implemented a door-to-door haircutting service. Every day, six people take turns carrying barber's kits to the nearby agricultural cooperatives to give haircuts to the members during their rest time.
    One morning, barber Sun Kuihua carried his kit to the sweet potato field of the Fourth Production Team of the Zhangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative. The members were turning the vines and weeding in the field. He put down his kit, wiped the sweat from his face, greeted the members, and went to the sweet potato field to pull weeds. When the members took a break, he moved his stool to the shade of the tree where the members were resting, took out his cloth and clippers, and called on people to get their hair cut. That day, he used the members' rest time to give haircuts to sixteen members, and also helped the agricultural cooperative weed more than one point of land.

　　田头上的理发师
    在社会主义建设大跃进中，我们灌云县的下车街镇理发合作小组里的八位理发师，也鼓足干劲，力争上游。为了支援农业生产，他们实行了上门理发的办法。每天轮流有六个人挑着理发担子分头到附近农业社去，在社员们休息时间给他们理发。
    有一天早晨，理发师孙奎华挑着担子来到了张庄农业社第四生产队的山芋田旁。社员们正在地里翻藤和锄草。他把担子放下，揩了揩脸上的汗水，向社员们打过招呼，就走到山芋田里去拔草。到社员们休息的时候，他就把凳子搬到社员们休息的树荫下，拿出围布和推子来招呼人们理发。这一天，他利用社员们休息时间，给十六个社员理了发，同时还帮助农业社拔了一分多地的草。
