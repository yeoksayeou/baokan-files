Xuchang Prefecture Achieves Ball Bearing Implementation for Transportation Vehicles in Ten Days
    Small Cart Load Capacity Doubles, Daily Transport Volume Increases Fourfold

    (Our reporter Hu Min reports) Henan Province's Xuchang Prefecture basically achieved ball bearing implementation for transportation vehicles in ten days. According to the development needs of the overall great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, this prefecture launched a high tide of ball bearing production throughout the region after July 20, concentrating on the production of ball bearings. There are 583 factories in the entire prefecture specializing in this production, including 105 county-run factories, 142 township-run factories, and 336 commune-run factories. The daily output of ball bearings in the entire region is 73,420 sets. From July 20 to 30, 332,900 of the 370,000 transportation vehicles in the prefecture's fifteen counties were equipped with ball bearings, accounting for 89.9% of the total number of transportation vehicles. Among them, the transportation vehicles in four counties, namely Changge, Shangshui, Lushan, and Wuyang, have all been equipped with ball bearings. Because the installation of ball bearings on transportation vehicles has achieved semi-mechanization, the labor productivity has been greatly improved. After the small local carts in Malou Township, Lushan County, were equipped with ball bearings self-made by the township's iron and wood industry factory, the load capacity increased from 250 jin to 500 jin. In addition, with the increase in driving speed and the reduction of physical labor, the labor efficiency per person per day increased by more than four times.
    The main experiences of Xuchang Prefecture in basically realizing the ball bearing implementation of transportation vehicles in these ten days are: First, the secretaries take the lead and the whole party is mobilized. From the prefectural committee to the county and municipal committees, there is a secretary in charge of this work, and there are responsible comrades in charge of the townships and communes. Second, carry out the anti-conservatism and anti-rightist thought struggle, organize free airing of views, and set off a high tide of agricultural tool reform. Third, carry out socialist large-scale cooperation: one is that each county generally holds on-site experience exchange meetings to impart technology, and the other is to support machinery and technology. In order to support the self-made ball bearings of townships and communes, the Xihua County Machinery Factory decentralized 15 wooden lathes to townships and communes. The Lushan County Machinery Factory rushed to make 23 lathes for various townships and communes. Changge County used the method of old factories leading new factories to dispatch technicians to support new factories on a contract basis. Fourth, rely on the masses to solve the difficulties of raw materials and funds. The iron and steel and other raw materials needed for the production of ball bearings were solved by the counties themselves after mobilizing the masses. The masses in Lin颍 County exchanged more than 7.91 million jin of iron. Xuchang County adopted the same method to solve all raw material problems. Fifth, improve production speed. Yuxian, Xihua, Xuchang, Shangshui and other four counties and Xuchang City have all successfully trial-produced white iron cast steel sleeves, which greatly accelerated the production speed.
    Now, on the basis of realizing the ball bearing implementation of transportation vehicles, the counties in Xuchang Prefecture require that agricultural tools be improved by the end of August, reaching one deep-plowing plow for every 90 mu of land, one disc harrow for every 450 mu of land, one seeder per team, one cultivator per 100 mu of land, one roller per team, four improved rollers per team, one slicer per 100,000 jin of sweet potatoes (calculated by each commune according to the plan), one winnowing fan and one hand-operated mill per team, three to five large carts per team, an average of one wooden cart per two households, and one rapid water lifting tool per 50 mu of land. All these tools are required to be fully equipped with ball bearings.

    许昌专区十天实现运输工具滚珠轴承化
    小车载重量提高一倍  每日运输量提高四倍
    本报讯　记者胡敏报道：河南省许昌专区十天基本实现运输工具滚珠轴承化。这个专区根据工农业生产全面大跃进形势的发展需要，在7月20日以后，在全区范围内开展了滚珠轴承生产高潮，突击生产滚珠轴承。全专区专门从事这项生产的工厂有五百八十三个，其中县营工厂有一百零五个，乡营工厂一百四十二个，社办工厂三百三十六个。全区日产滚珠轴承七万三千四百二十套。从7月20日到30日，全区十五个县三十七万辆运输工具已装上滚珠轴承的有三十三万二千九百辆，占运输工具总数的89.9％。其中长葛、商水、鲁山、舞阳等四个县运输工具已经全部安上了滚珠轴承。由于运输工具装上滚珠轴承实现了半机械化，大大地提高了劳动生产率。鲁山县马楼乡的小土车装上本乡铁木业工厂自制的滚珠轴承以后，装载量由二百五十斤增加到五百斤，加上行车速度的提高和体力劳动的减轻，每日每人的劳动效率提高四倍以上。
    许昌专区在这十天里基本上实现运输工具滚珠轴承化的主要经验是：一、书记挂帅，全党动员，从地委到县、市委都有一个书记专管此项工作，乡、社都有负责同志管理。二、开展反保守反右倾思想，组织鸣放辩论，掀起农具改革高潮。三、进行社会主义大协作：一是各县普遍召开现场经验交流会传授技术，一是支援机器，支援技术。西华县机械厂为支援乡、社自制滚珠轴承，下放乡、社木制车床十五部，鲁山县机械厂为各乡、社赶制车床二十三部，长葛县用老厂带新厂的办法，调派技术人员包干支援新厂。四、依靠群众解决原材料、资金困难。生产滚珠轴承需要的钢铁和其它原材料，经过发动群众，各县都自己进行解决。临颖县群众兑出铁七百九十一万多斤。许昌县采用同样办法，解决了全部原材料问题。五、提高生产速度。禹县、西华、许昌、商水等四个县和许昌市都已试制成功白铁铸钢套，大大加快了生产速度。
    现在许昌专区各县在实现运输工具滚珠轴承化的基础上，要求8月底以前实现农具改良化，达到九十亩地一张深耕犁，四百五十亩地一个圆盘耙，每队一个播种机，一百亩地一个中耕器，一队一个镇压器，一队四个改良磙，每十万斤红薯（由各社根据规划计算）一部切片机，每队一个风车、一个手摇磨，每队三——五辆大车，平均每两户一个木制架子车，五十亩地一部快速提水工具。所有这些工具都要求全部安上滚珠轴承。
