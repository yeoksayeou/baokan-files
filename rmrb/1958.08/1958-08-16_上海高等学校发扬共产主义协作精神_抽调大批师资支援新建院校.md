    Shanghai Universities Promote the Communist Spirit of Collaboration
　　Transferring a Large Number of Teachers to Support Newly Established Institutions
    (Our reporter Chen Xiangdong reports) Shanghai's universities, promoting the communist spirit, are transferring a large number of teachers to support brotherly institutions in various provinces of East China and major cooperative regions across the country, including many provinces such as Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Guangdong, as well as key industrial construction departments. From January to the present, over five hundred professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and a few administrative staff have been transferred, of whom over two hundred have successively taken up their new posts.
    This year, in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in economic and cultural construction, higher education in East China's Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces, as well as other provinces, has greatly developed. Anhui Province alone has newly built and expanded several institutions of higher learning this year, such as Hefei University, Anhui Normal College, Hefei Mining Institute, and Bengbu Medical College. They all requested that Shanghai universities provide special support in terms of teaching staff. At the same time, higher education in Shanghai will also develop significantly this autumn. In addition to the four newly built universities, the enrollment tasks of existing universities have doubled compared with last year. There has also been a large increase in the number of majors and evening schools. Taking the East China Institute of Chemical Technology as an example, the number of majors has increased from the original nine to twenty-one, and the number of students will increase fourfold compared with last year. Therefore, the teaching staff of each school is generally not abundant, and some colleges and majors are still very short of teachers due to the large increase in tasks. Under these circumstances, each school still vigorously transfers teachers with a communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation to meet the more urgent needs of brotherly institutions. They are adopting methods such as tapping potential, adjusting teaching plans, expanding class sizes, appropriately increasing teachers' teaching hours, and organizing teachers from various schools to take part-time classes and cooperate to solve their own difficulties. In order to enable the supported brotherly institutions to start classes smoothly, for the key supported schools, the method of equipping complete sets of personnel from department heads to teaching assistants and even administrative and library management personnel by one or several schools is adopted. Fudan University supports Hefei University, Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine supports Suzhou Medical College, Shanghai First Medical College supports Chongqing Medical College, Shanghai Second Medical College supports Bengbu Medical College, Jiaotong University, Tongji University and East China Institute of Chemical Technology support the Engineering College of Xiamen University, and East China Normal University supports Anhui Normal College, Hangzhou University, Jiangxi University and Shandong Qufu Normal College. Each university pays great attention to the quality of the teachers transferred for support. Before deciding on the transfer, they consult with the brotherly institutions on the specific candidates according to their specific requirements, so as to ensure that all the supported teachers meet the needs and take on the teaching tasks. In order to help brotherly institutions easily solve organizational leadership problems and ensure teaching quality, a certain number of backbone forces are also equipped. For example, among the eighty-five people that East China Normal University has already decided to transfer, there are thirty-three department heads, teaching and research group leaders, professors, associate professors, and lecturers, and thirty-six party and league members. Although Jiaotong University is responsible for equipping the newly built Shanghai Metallurgical College and the teaching staff transferred to Xi'an, and the enrollment task has doubled, it still transferred more than thirty people. After Fudan University's Russian Department transferred one professor, one associate professor, one lecturer, and two teaching assistants to support Hefei University, they were still short of eleven teachers, and they will find ways to overcome this difficulty. All of these fully demonstrate the communist spirit of everything for the common cause and "selflessness."
    The transferred teachers all regard supporting brotherly institutions as a glorious task, and they have expressed their willingness to obey the distribution and ensure that they will go wherever they are transferred. Jiang Haoquan, a lecturer in the Physical Education Department of Fudan University, said that after arriving at Hefei University, he would definitely do a good job in the Physical Education Department and challenge the Physical Education Department of Fudan University.
    In addition to directly supporting teachers, Shanghai universities are also helping brotherly institutions solve the problem of teachers faster and better in a variety of ways, such as signing contracts to train teachers on their behalf, training graduate students, and sending people to give lectures regularly. It is estimated that nearly one thousand people will be sent to Shanghai universities by brotherly institutions from all over the country this year for training and further education.

    上海高等学校发扬共产主义协作精神
　　抽调大批师资支援新建院校
    本报讯　记者陈向东报道：上海市高等学校发扬共产主义精神，抽调大批师资支援华东各省和全国各大协作区，包括黑龙江、内蒙古、青海、四川、广东等许多省区的兄弟院校以及重点工业建设部门。从1月到目前为止，已抽调教授、讲师、助教以及少数行政工作人员五百余人，其中二百余人已陆续走上新的岗位。
    今年华东地区安徽、浙江、江西、福建等省，以及其他各省为了适应经济建设和文化建设大跃进的需要，高等教育事业都有很大的发展，仅安徽省今年就新建、扩建合肥大学、安徽师范学院、合肥矿业学院、蚌埠医学院等高等学校好几所，它们都要求上海市高等学校特别在师资上给予支援。同时，今年秋季上海市高等教育事业也有很大的发展，除新建高等学校四所外，原有高等学校的招生任务，比去年增加一倍，专业设置和业余学校，也都有很大的增加，以华东化工学院为例，就由原来的九个专业增至二十一个专业，学生人数将比去年增加四倍。因此，各校师资一般也不充裕，有的院校和专业由于任务增加很多，师资还很缺乏。在这种情况下，各校还是以共产主义的互助协作精神，大力抽调师资，满足兄弟院校更加迫切的需要。自己的困难，采用挖掘潜力，调整教学计划，扩大班级，适当增加教师授课时数，以及组织各校教师互相兼课、协作等办法解决。为了使被支援的兄弟院校能够顺利地开始上课，对于重点支援的学校，还采取由一校或数校从系主任到助教以至行政和图书管理人员成套配备的办法。复旦大学对合肥大学，上海中医学院对苏州医学院，上海第一医学院对重庆医学院，上海第二医学院对蚌埠医学院，交通大学、同济大学和华东化工学院对厦门大学工学院，华东师范学院对安徽师范学院、杭州大学、江西大学和山东曲阜师范学院，都是采取这种办法。各高等学校对抽调支援的师资，都很注意质量。在决定抽调之前，根据兄弟院校的具体要求，和他们协商具体人选，以求全部支援师资都能符合需要，负起教学任务。为了帮助兄弟院校便于解决组织领导问题和保证教学质量，还配备一定数量的骨干力量。如华东师范大学在已经决定调出的八十五人中，就有系主任、教研组主任、教授、副教授和讲师三十三人，党团员三十六人。交通大学虽然要负责配备新建的上海冶金学院和迁往西安部分的师资，并且招生任务增加一倍，还是抽出了三十余人。复旦大学俄语系抽调教授、副教授、讲师各一人和助教二人支援合肥大学后，自己还缺教师十一人，他们将自行设法克服这个困难。所有这些都充分表现了一切为了共同事业和“舍己为人”的共产主义精神。
    被抽调的教师，都把支援兄弟院校当成光荣任务，纷纷表示愉快地服从分配，保证调到那里就去那里。复旦大学体育系讲师蒋浩泉表示到合肥大学后，一定把体育系搞好，并同复旦大学体育系挑战。
    除抽调师资直接支援外，上海各高等学校还以签订合同代训师资、培养研究生和派人前去定期讲学等多种方式，帮助各兄弟院校更快更好地解决师资问题。估计今年各地兄弟院校派到上海高等学校代训、培训的约近一千人。
