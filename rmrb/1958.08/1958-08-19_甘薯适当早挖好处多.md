Early Harvesting of Sweet Potatoes Has Many Advantages
　　YU Jie

This year's sweet potato planting across the country, both in terms of area and yield, is much larger than last year. Therefore, we are faced with serious tasks in terms of harvesting, storage, and distribution. Doing these tasks well has great significance politically and economically.

The sweet potato planting season is very long. The shortest locations have seventy to eighty days, the general regions have about one hundred days, and the planting time in South China is even longer. The planting time between early sweet potatoes and late sweet potatoes also varies significantly, generally forty to fifty days, and sometimes even longer. However, during the sweet potato maturation period, the sweet potatoes have more starch and less moisture, and the sunlight is strong, making it easy to dry them, which is suitable for drying sweet potato chips. Therefore, all regions should grasp the season and harvest and dry them early at the appropriate time. Taking early-maturing sweet potatoes as an example, they can be dug up and dried after the Autumn Equinox in the south and after the Cold Dew in the north.

There are many benefits to harvesting and drying early sweet potatoes early: the main component of sweet potatoes is starch, and drying them when they are ripe can preserve more starch, making them more nutritious; they taste better, have less moisture, which is good for storage and saves labor. Moreover, harvesting early sweet potatoes early frees up land for planting other crops. At the same time, it can solve the problem of insufficient labor during concentrated harvesting. Delaying harvesting only increases the quantity of fresh sweet potatoes, but most of what is added is water. If it is delayed until after the Frost's Descent, not only does the water content increase, but the starch gradually saccharifies. Saccharification not only reduces starch, but the sun gradually weakens at this time, making it difficult to dry. Even if it is dried, it is easy to become damp and difficult to store. The nutritional value is greatly reduced, and it does not taste good, so delaying the harvesting and drying of sweet potatoes is not worth it.

Early sweet potatoes can also be dug and eaten earlier. Farmers have traditionally had the habit of digging and eating as they go, which makes sense. Because eating them fresh and early has high nutritional value; it can also regulate life, saving some grain for year-round regulation, avoiding the phenomenon of eating only sweet potatoes when eating sweet potatoes and eating only grain when eating grain. At the same time, it can save labor for concentrated drying of sweet potato chips and reduce storage difficulties.

Harvesting sweet potatoes early at the appropriate time is also suitable for cellar storage. Generally, they should be dug out before the moisture content is too high and before saccharification occurs, and after slightly drying off the moisture, they should be put into the cellar, so that the storage time is longer and the nutritional value is higher.

Whether it is early sweet potatoes or late sweet potatoes (especially late sweet potatoes), harvesting must seize the season and the climate. If the opportunity is lost, losses will be incurred. Because if harvesting is not seized during the harvest season, the moisture content will increase and saccharification will occur. Only after they are dried into sweet potato chips and put into the warehouse are they a treasure, whether for human consumption, as feed, or as industrial raw materials.

Sweet potato vines are a good feed. In the past, we saw many places leave them in the field until after the frost before harvesting. This is a big loss, which reduces the nutritional value of the vines; at the same time, it also affects the quality of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the harvesting of sweet potato vines must also seize the season and the climate. It is best to cut them down five to ten days before the frost, tie them into small bundles, dry them, and then crush them for storage. This not only makes them easy to store and nutritious, but also easy to cook, tastes good, and pigs love to eat them.

### 甘薯适当早挖好处多

　　甘薯适当早挖好处多
　　喻杰
    今年全国栽种的甘薯，无论在面积上和产量上，都比去年大得多。因此，不管在收获方面、保管方面、分配方面，都给我们提出了严重任务。把这些工作做好，在政治上和经济上都有重大的意义。
    甘薯栽种的季节时间是很长的。最短的地方有七、八十天，一般地区有一百天左右，华南地区的栽种时间还要长些。早甘薯与晚甘薯的栽种时间相距也是很长的，一般的四、五十天，有的还要长些。但是，在甘薯的成熟期间，甘薯的淀粉多，水份较少，太阳光强，容易晒干，正宜于晒薯干。因此，各地要掌握季节，适时地早挖早晒。以早熟甘薯来说，南方过了秋分，北方过了寒露就可以挖出，晒干。
    早甘薯早挖早晒干，好处很多：甘薯的成分主要是淀粉，到成熟时即晒干，就可以保持更多的淀粉，营养价值高；吃味好，水份小，既好保管又节省人力。而且，早甘薯早收割了，腾出土地又可以播种其他庄稼。同时，还可以解决集中收获时劳动力不足问题。迟挖不过是从鲜薯的数量上多一些，但所多的大多是水份，如果迟到霜降以后，不但是水份增加，而且淀粉逐渐糖化。糖化了不但淀粉减少，到这时太阳也逐渐减弱了，不容易晒干。即使晒干了也容易返潮，不好保管。营养价值更大大降低了，也不好吃，所以甘薯迟挖迟晒是得不偿失的。
    早甘薯还可以早一点边挖边吃。农民在以往就有边挖边吃的习惯，这是有道理的。因为早一点边挖边吃，既新鲜、营养价值高；又能调剂生活，可以节省一些粮食作常年调剂，避免吃甘薯时尽吃甘薯，吃粮食时尽吃粮食的现象。同时，还可以节省集中晒薯干的人工，减少保管的困难。
    甘薯适时地早挖，还宜于窖藏。一般的在水份较小、还没有糖化以前就挖出来，将水气稍为晾干一点以后，再去入窖，这样保存的时间也长，营养价值也高。
    无论是早甘薯、晚甘薯（特别是晚甘薯），收获都要抢季节、抢气候。如果失去了时机，就会遭受损失。因为到了收获季节不抓紧收获，就要增加水份，并且糖化了。只要晒成甘薯干，入了仓库以后，才是宝中之宝，无论是人食，作饲料、作工业原料都好办了。
    甘薯藤子是一种很好的饲料，以往看到许多地方在地里让霜冻以后才收割。这是个很大的损失，既减少了藤子的营养价值；同时，对甘薯的质量也有影响。因此，甘薯藤子的收割也要抢季节、抢气候。最好是在下霜前的五至十天的时间割下来，扎成小捆子，晒干后粉碎保存起来。这样作，不但好保管，养料多，而且容易煮熟，味也香，猪爱吃。
