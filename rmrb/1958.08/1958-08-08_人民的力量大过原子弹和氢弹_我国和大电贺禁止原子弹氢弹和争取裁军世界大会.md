Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The China Peace Committee sent a telegram on the 6th to congratulate the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, to be held in Tokyo on the 15th. The telegram is as follows:

To the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament in Tokyo,
Dear Friends:

The China Peace Committee, on behalf of all the Chinese people, extends warm congratulations to the conference and sincere respect to the peace fighters dedicated to the noble cause of mankind. The Chinese people support all the positive proposals of the conference that are conducive to defending peace and opposing aggression, support your efforts to ban nuclear weapons and reduce armaments, and together with you, strive to ease international tensions and support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East to safeguard national independence.

Recently, the armed aggression of the Middle East by US and British imperialism has seriously threatened peace in the Middle East and the world, bringing mankind to the brink of war. The people of the world must stop the aggression and interference of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan, demand that US and British imperialism withdraw their invading troops, and oppose the imperialists' intensified preparations for new wars and subversive activities. The forces of war and aggression headed by US imperialism have once again proved to the world that they not only continue to adhere to the so-called policy of strength, refuse to reduce armaments, but also intensify their arms expansion and war preparations and carry out war threats; they not only have not stopped implementing the policy of military aggression groups and military bases, but also attempt to continue to manipulate the "Baghdad Pact" without Baghdad, and instruct their agents to piece together the so-called "Northeast Asia Alliance"; they not only stubbornly refuse to stop nuclear weapons tests, but also conducted more than 30 nuclear explosions in the Pacific region after the Soviet Union announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear weapons tests. At the same time, US imperialism is also stepping up the transportation of various atomic weapons and rockets into Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, our territory occupied by the United States, expanding medium-range missile bases around the world, and using nuclear weapons to threaten and provoke. Just as the adventurous behavior of the US and British aggressors in the Middle East has been severely condemned by the people of the world and met with heroic resistance from the people of the Middle East, leading to their failure, the US imperialism's atomic blackmail policy will inevitably go bankrupt, because the power of the people is greater than any atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb.

The current era is not only one of artificial satellites and intercontinental missiles, but also one of unprecedented awakening and unity of the people of the world—an age of growing strength and development of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We love peace, but we will never beg for peace from the imperialist aggressors. We hate war, but we will never be intimidated by any deterrent policy. History has repeatedly shown the people that war can only be stopped by resolutely repelling imperialist aggressors. The history of the two world wars tells us that the culprits who launch wars will ultimately be punished by the people. Look again at the Korean War, the Indochina War, and the Egyptian War—didn't the aggressors suffer disgraceful defeats under the heavy blows of the people? This time, the unity and strength of the people of the world have once again made US and British imperialism dare not launch a blatant attack on Iraq. But we must also see that the US and British invading troops have not yet rolled out of the Middle East, and the imperialists may expand their aggression and launch new war adventures. If the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people of the world, all peace-loving and free countries and people will completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors.

It is of special significance that the conference is being held in Japan to discuss the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and the promotion of disarmament. Japan was the first country to be bombed with atomic bombs by the United States, is the country most severely affected by the US and British nuclear weapons tests, and also has the most US military bases in the world. Today, people can still see the scenes of atomic destruction and hear the groans of atomic victims. The Chinese people fully understand the feelings of the Japanese people about the US imperialism's open transportation of atomic weapons into Japan and continued nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific, and understand the tenacious and courageous struggle that the Japanese people have been waging. The Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, and against the Japanese reactionary forces' collusion with US imperialism in an attempt to revive Japanese militarism, is also a struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world. In the Japanese people's just struggle to safeguard peace and independence and oppose dragging Japan onto the old road of imperialism, they can count on the support and sympathy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people distinguish between the peace-loving Japanese people and the Kishi Nobusuke government, which follows the United States in antagonizing the Chinese people.

The Chinese people, together with the people of other countries in the socialist camp, stand on the forefront of defending peace. The recent meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union reflected the determination and power of the people of all countries to defend peace and is conducive to the cause of defending peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. The Chinese people have also made many great efforts to maintain peace, such as successively reducing the army by more than 2.7 million since 1951, withdrawing all Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in batches this year, and providing strong support for the current Middle Eastern people's opposition to US and British imperialist aggression. The unprecedented achievements of the Chinese people in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production also demonstrate the continuous growth and strength of the forces of peace. For example, steel production is growing rapidly at an astonishing rate. In agriculture, the total output of wheat, early rice, and other summer grain crops in our country this year increased by about 42 billion kilograms compared with last year, and the total output of wheat has exceeded that of the United States. At present, we are carrying out the huge comprehensive utilization projects of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. China's first experimental atomic reactor for peaceful use of atomic energy has been officially put into operation, and the cyclotron has been built, thus stepping into the atomic age. The reason why the Chinese people are able to create miracles in building socialism with soaring enthusiasm is because our people are awakened, united, and organized, and because we are full of confidence in the future of mankind. We believe that the power of the people is infinite, and it will not allow imperialism to drag mankind into another world war.

Finally, we want to point out that the enemies of peace do not like your conference in Tokyo, and they may use threats and sabotage to disrupt this solemn conference and harm the just cause we are engaged in. We urge you to pay attention to the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. You must also be vigilant against some disguised peace advocates who are actually hired by the forces of war, and they will do everything possible to whitewash the war-mongers, obscure the roots of war, and even distort the facts. But we believe that your confidence is firm and your eyes are discerning. With your collective wisdom and joint efforts, any conspiracy will surely be crushed.

The Chinese people sincerely wish the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament a success!

China Peace Committee

    人民的力量大过原子弹和氢弹
    我国和大电贺禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会
    新华社7日讯  中国人民保卫世界和平委员会6日致电祝贺将于15日在东京举行的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会。电文如下：
    东京第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会亲爱的朋友们：
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会代表全中国人民，向大会致热烈的祝贺，向致力于人类崇高事业的和平战士表示衷心的敬意。中国人民支持大会一切有利于保卫和平和反对侵略的积极建议，支持你们为禁止核武器和裁减军备而作的努力，并同你们一起为缓和国际紧张局势与支援中东人民维护民族独立的正义斗争而共同奋斗。
    最近美英帝国主义对中东的武装侵略，严重地威胁中东和世界和平，使人类濒于战争灾难的边缘。全世界人民必须制止美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略和干涉，要求美英帝国主义撤出侵略军队，反对帝国主义加紧准备新的战争和颠复活动。以美帝国主义为首的战争和侵略势力再一次地向全世界证明了：它不仅仍然坚持所谓实力政策，拒绝裁减军备，反而加紧扩军备战和进行战争威胁；它不但没有停止执行军事侵略集团和军事基地的政策，还企图继续操纵没有巴格达的“巴格达条约”，并指使它的代理人拼凑所谓“东北亚联盟”；它不仅顽固地拒绝停止试验核武器，反而在苏联宣布单方面停止试验核武器后，在太平洋地区进行了三十多次核爆炸。与此同时，美帝国主义还加紧把各种原子武器和火箭运进日本、南朝鲜和美国霸占着的我国领土台湾，在世界各地扩建中程导弹基地，以及用核武器进行威胁和挑衅。正像美英侵略者在中东的冒险行为遭到全世界人民的严厉谴责和中东人民的英勇反抗而走向失败，美帝国主义的原子讹诈政策也必然破产，因为人民的力量是超过任何原子弹和氢弹的。
    目前不仅进入了人造卫星和洲际导弹的时代，也是全世界人民空前觉醒和团结的时代——以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动日益强大和发展的时代。我们热爱和平，但决不向帝国主义侵略者乞求和平，我们憎恨战争，但决不会被任何威慑政策所吓倒。历史一再昭示人民：对帝国主义侵略者必须予以坚决回击，才能制止战争。两次世界大战的历史告诉我们，发动战争的祸首最后必受到人民的惩罚。再看看在朝鲜战争、印度支那战争和埃及战争中，侵略者不是都在人民的沉重打击下遭到可耻的失败吗？这次全世界人民的团结和力量，又使得美英帝国主义不敢对伊拉克发动明目张胆的进攻。但是我们还必须看到美英侵略军队还没有从中东滚出去，帝国主义还可能扩大侵略和发动新的战争冒险。如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，所有爱好和平和自由的国家和人民必将彻底地把帝国主义侵略者消灭。
    大会在日本召开来讨论禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军的问题，是有特殊意义的。日本是被美国投下原子弹的第一个国家，是受美国和英国试验核武器灾害最大的国家，也是世界上美国军事基地最多的国家。如今人们还可以看见原子破坏的情景，还可以听到原子受难者的呻吟。中国人民完全理解日本人民对美帝国主义把原子武器公开运进日本和继续在太平洋试验核武器的感情，理解日本人民一直在进行的顽强而勇敢的斗争。日本人民争取和平、独立、民主与反对日本反动势力勾结美帝国主义力图恢复日本军国主义的斗争，也是保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。在日本人民维护和平与独立、反对把日本拖上帝国主义老路的正义斗争中，可以指望中国人民的支持与同情。中国人民是把爱好和平的日本人民和追随美国敌视中国人民的岸信介政府区别起来看待的。
    中国人民和社会主义阵营其他国家的人民一起，站在保卫和平的最前线。最近中苏两国领导人的会谈，反映了各国人民保卫和平的决心与力量，有利于保卫亚非和世界和平的事业。中国人民对维护和平还作了许多巨大的努力，如从1951年起陆续裁减了军队二百七十万以上，在今年内分批把中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，以及对当前中东人民反对美英帝国主义侵略的有力支持。中国人民在工农业生产大跃进中的空前成就，也说明了和平力量的不断生长和强大。如钢铁产量正以惊人的速度飞快增长。在农业方面，我国今年麦子、早稻以及其它夏收粮食的总产量共比去年增产四百二十亿公斤左右，小麦总产量已超过美国。目前我们正在进行着巨大的黄河与长江综合利用工程。我国和平利用原子能的第一座实验性原子反应堆已正式运转，回旋加速器已经建成，从而跨进了原子能时代。中国人民所以能够以冲天的干劲在建设社会主义事业中创造奇迹，是由于我国的人民是觉醒了的、团结起来的、组织起来的人民，由于我们对人类的未来充满了信心。我们相信，人民的力量是无穷无尽的，它不会允许帝国主义把人类拖进另一次世界大战中。
    最后我们要指出，和平的敌人是不喜欢你们在东京举行的大会的，他们可能用威胁和捣乱来破坏这个庄严的大会，损害我们从事的正义事业。我们提请你们注意和平敌人的阴谋。你们也要警惕一些伪装的和平人士，他们实际上是战争势力的雇佣人，他们会千方百计为战争贩子粉饰，蒙混战争的根源，甚至颠倒黑白。但是我们相信，你们的信心是坚定的，你们的眼睛是雪亮的。在你们的集体智慧和共同努力之下，任何阴谋都一定会被粉碎。
    中国人民衷心地祝贺第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的成功！
                                中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
                                        1958年8月6日  北京
