　　The Shark Catching Record
　　Jiang Xueping
    Lianxing First Cooperative of Xiaoyang Township, Jimo County, Shandong Province, caught a large shark with a body length of fourteen meters and a weight of 7,150 jin using a Yuan net boat with a load capacity of 4,000 jin, sixty miles from the land. When the net was initially raised, the ferocious shark shook its head, wagged its tail, and struggled violently. The fishermen tried several times to grab its tail to tie a rope, but with a slight flick of the tail, the person grabbing it was thrown onto the boat. Six fishermen were scratched by the shark skin. Later, the brave and resourceful technician on the boat came up with a solution: he tied the rope into a slipknot, used a net pole to open it, gently put it around the shark's tail, and tightened the knot to secure the tail. At this time, the shark wanted to escape and sink, causing the boat to tilt dangerously. Several fishermen rushed to the high side of the boat to stabilize it. Fortunately, two nearby fishing boats came to help, hoisted the shark's tail, and beat the shark until it was half-dead before dragging it ashore.
    Among the fishermen on the boat was Yu Zhongchang, who had caught a shark of similar size several years ago. However, due to the constraints of feudal superstition, he dared not offend the fish's power. Moreover, due to the backwardness of individual farming, he ended up abandoning the net and releasing the fish, resulting in reduced production for the entire season and a difficult life. Recalling the past and comparing it with the present, he said excitedly, "Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and without the superiority of the cooperative, fishermen would never dare to fight against such a large fish!"

　　擒鲨记
　　姜学平
    山东即墨县晓阳乡联星一社，在距陆地六十华里的海面上，以一只载重四千斤的元网船，捕获了一条体长十四公尺、重七千一百五十斤的大鲨鱼。在初起网时，凶猛的鲨鱼摇头摆尾，上下翻腾，拼命挣扎，渔民们几次抓住尾巴想拴绳索，但鱼尾轻轻地一摆，即将抓鱼尾的人甩倒船上。六名渔民，都被鱼皮擦伤。后来船上勇敢机智的技术员想出办法，把绳子拴成活扣，用网蒿撑开，轻轻的套着鱼尾，拉紧了绳扣，才将鱼尾拴住。此时，鱼想脱逃下沉，把船身带得倾斜欲翻，数名渔民急忙抢奔船的上帮，才将船身稳住。幸好后来附近两只渔船增援协助，把鱼尾吊起，用棍把鱼打成半死，才得拖到岸上。
    这船上有个渔民于忠昌，数年前也曾捕过这样大的鲨鱼，但由于封建迷信思想的束缚，不敢触犯鱼威，又因单干生产方式落后，结果连网都丢弃了，将鱼放掉，造成全季欠产，生活困难。他回忆过去，对比现在，很激动的说：“如果没有共产党毛主席的领导，没有合作社的优越性，渔民是永远不敢向这样大的鱼作斗争的。”（附图片）
