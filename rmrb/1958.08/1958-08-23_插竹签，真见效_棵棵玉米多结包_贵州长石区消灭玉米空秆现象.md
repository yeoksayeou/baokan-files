Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 22nd: In the high and cold mountainous area of northwestern Guizhou, Changshi District in Dafang County, the 53,000+ mu of corn has for the first time eliminated the barren stalk phenomenon, and every stalk has grown corn ears.

The corn planting area in Changshi District is more than double that of rice. In the past, about one-tenth of the corn stalks would be barren each year, affecting increased production. In late July this year, the Changshi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered that Shanba Cooperative had successfully eliminated the barren stalk phenomenon by inserting bamboo sticks into the corn. They immediately sent people to summarize the experience, and the Shanba Agricultural Science Research Station demonstrated it on the spot and promoted it throughout the district. Because they adopted the methods of mobilizing, arranging, and conducting on-site visits at all levels, all cadres and masses in the district went into action to "give barren corn stalks injections." By the first half of August, all barren corn stalks had been inserted with bamboo sticks, and widespread stick insertion had been carried out on 5,800 mu of cornfields.

The effect of inserting bamboo sticks into the corn is very obvious. There are no more barren stalks. Corn stalks that originally only grew one ear now generally grow three or four ears, and the most reach nine.

　　插竹签，真见效
    棵棵玉米多结包
    贵州长石区消灭玉米空秆现象
    据新华社贵阳22日电　贵州西北部高寒山区里的大方县长石区，五万三千多亩玉米已经第一次消灭了空秆现象，株株长起了玉米包。
    长石区玉米播种面积比水稻多一倍多，以往每年都有十分之一左右的玉米发生空秆现象，影响增产。今年7月下旬，中共长石区委发现山坝社利用插竹签玉米消灭空秆现象获得成功，立即派人去总结经验，并由山坝农业科学研究站当场示范，全区推广。由于采取了层层动员、布置、现场参观的办法，全区干部和群众就人人动手“给空秆玉米打针”。到8月上半月止，全部空秆玉米都已插上竹签，并对五千八百亩玉米地进行了普遍插签。
    玉米经过插竹签后，效果非常明显。空秆已经没有了，原来只长一个包的玉米秆，现在一般长到三四个包，最多的达九个。
