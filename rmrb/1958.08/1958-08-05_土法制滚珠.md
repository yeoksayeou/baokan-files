Homemade Ball Bearings

    The Xianyang County and Township Farm Implement Repair Plant in Shaanxi has recently adopted a local method for making ball bearings, which is both simple and economical. The production process is as follows:

    I. Cutting Material: Use round iron rods as the raw material for the ball bearings. Generally, ball bearings used on large carts are 5 or 4 fen in diameter, those used on waterwheels are 3 fen, and those used on handcarts are 2.5 fen. Use round iron rods of the corresponding thickness to make the desired size of ball bearings. Use a small hacksaw to cut the iron rods into "small segments."

    II. Hammering Round: The tool for making round ball bearings is a set of steel molds shaped like a hammer and mortar used in the countryside for "pounding" garlic cloves. Two semicircles are dug out at the lower end of the steel hammer and in the center of the steel mortar, and these two semicircles "combine" to form a round hollow. Place the cut material into the bottom semicircle and hammer with the steel hammer, checking as you hammer. Soon it will be hammered into a "round egg," which is the ball bearing.

    III. Tempering: Use fire-resistant clay mixed with broken bowl and jar pieces and coal cinders to make "sand," and make high-heat-resistant jars. Sprinkle four or five layers of tempering powder inside (the composition and ratio of the powder are: potassium ferrocyanide, also known as "self-powered" [zi lai qiang] accounting for 40%, bone meal accounting for 25%, charcoal ash accounting for 30%, and alkali accounting for 5%). Spread a layer of ball bearings on each layer of powder. Load five or six tempering jars into the mud tempering furnace, insert an iron rod in the middle. Once everything is ready, burn charcoal underneath (burning charcoal makes it easier to control the heat). If the ball bearings are 2.5 fen in diameter, burn for one hour; ball bearings 5 fen in diameter require more than two hours. Wait until the slow fire turns the iron rod purple-red, then use iron tongs to clamp out the tempering jars one by one. Take out the ball bearings and dip them in cold water, and they become hard ball bearings.

    IV. Polishing: In order to make the ball bearings look smooth and reduce friction, the tempered ball bearings must be polished to be smooth, without any pitting. The drum for polishing ball bearings is made of wood, with some glass shards inside. A crank is installed on the outside of the drum. Pour the ball bearings into the drum and shake the drum, using the force of the glass and the force of the ball bearings colliding with each other to polish the ball bearings until they are smooth and shiny.

    土法制滚珠
    陕西咸阳县、乡农具修配厂，最近采用一种土办法制滚珠，既省事又省钱。制作的过程简单如下：
    一、下料：用圆铁棍做滚珠的原料。一般大车上用的滚珠直径为五分或四分，水车上用的为三分，架子车上用的为二分半。要做多大的滚珠，就用多么粗的圆铁棍。用小钢锯把铁棍锯成“小节节”。
    二、砸圆：做圆滚珠的工具，是一付类似乡下“捣”蒜瓣用的锤、钵形状的钢模。在钢锤下端和钢钵的中心挖两个半圆，这两个半圆合起来刚好“合”成一个圆窝窝。把截下的料装到底下的半圆内，用钢锤砸，随砸随看，很快就砸成了“圆蛋蛋”，这就是滚珠。
    三、闷火：用耐火土调上破碗破缸片和煤碴合成的“砂子”，做成耐高热的罐罐，里边洒上四、五层闷火用的药粉，（药粉的成分和配合比例是：黄血盐钾，又名自来强占40％，牛骨粉占25％，木炭灰占30％，碱面占5％）每层药粉铺一层滚珠，把五、六个闷火罐装进闷火的泥炉，中间插个铁棍，一切准备好了，就在下边架木炭（烧木炭便于掌握火候）烧，如果二分半直径的滚珠烧一小时，五分直径的滚珠需两小时以上，一直等慢火把铁棍烧成了紫红色，然后用铁钳把闷火罐一个个夹出来，取出滚珠往凉水里一蘸，即成了质料坚硬的滚珠。
    四、磨光：为了使滚珠外观光滑，减少磨擦，还必须把闷火加硬后的滚珠磨光滑，没有一点麻脸。磨滚珠的滚筒是用木头做的，里边装一些玻璃碴子，滚筒外边安了个摇把，把滚珠倒进滚筒，摇动滚筒，就借玻璃的力量和滚珠互相撞击的力量，把滚珠磨得光圆净亮。
