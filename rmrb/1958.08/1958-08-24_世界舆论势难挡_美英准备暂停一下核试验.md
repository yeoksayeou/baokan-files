Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement on August 22nd regarding the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests. The US policy of continuing nuclear tests after the Soviet Union halted them has been sharply condemned by world opinion. The recently concluded Geneva conference of nuclear experts has concluded that it is technically possible to establish effective supervision of the cessation of nuclear tests. As a result, the US President had to state in the declaration that the United States is "ready to promptly begin negotiations with other countries that have tested nuclear weapons on an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons tests and actually establishing an international monitoring system based on the experts' report."

The statement said that "the United States is prepared - unless the Soviet Union resumes testing - to cease further testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons for a period of one year after the start of negotiations."

The statement also said that, "as part of an agreement to be negotiated, and on a mutual basis," the United States will be prepared in the future to cease nuclear tests on a yearly basis, but each year must be determined at the beginning of the year that an inspection system is "established and effectively implemented," that "agreement has been reached on significant arms control measures" and that "satisfactory progress" has been made in implementation.

The date proposed in the statement for holding negotiations is October 31st of this year. American news agencies said that the United States chose this date obviously out of consideration that the United States would have already completed the series of nuclear tests it originally planned to conduct this year by then. Some people in the United States also believe that a one-year suspension of testing would not hinder the US's atomic build-up plan.

White House officials, commenting on Eisenhower's statement, said it would be "wrong" to assume that the United States will permanently cease testing.

Xinhua News Agency, London, August 22nd: The British government announced in a statement tonight that, due to the conclusion of the Geneva conference of nuclear experts, the British government is prepared to hold talks with "other governments that have conducted nuclear weapons tests" from October 31st to sign an agreement on "stopping nuclear weapons tests under effective international supervision."

Like the statement issued by the United States on this issue, the British government's statement said that the British government would, from the start of negotiations, "not continue to test nuclear weapons for one year." However, the statement went on to propose a series of conditions for this decision: all governments that have conducted nuclear weapons tests accept the principle of starting negotiations on October 31st on the organization, establishment, and functions of supervisory bodies; the Soviet government does not resume testing within the aforementioned stipulated period; and the British government is prepared to "cease conducting nuclear tests for successive periods of one year thereafter, if the Soviet Union does so as well, and if satisfactory progress has been made in moving towards the establishment of an effective international monitoring system for the cessation of nuclear tests, and in moving towards the adoption and implementation of genuine disarmament measures."

The British government also announced that it would insist on doing so only after completing the current series of tests being conducted on Christmas Island.

While announcing the cessation of nuclear testing, the British government revealed that a nuclear device had exploded on Christmas Island tonight.

### 世界舆论势难挡  美英准备暂停一下核试验

　　世界舆论势难挡
    美英准备暂停一下核试验
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔22日发表了关于停止核武器试验问题的声明。在苏联停止核武器试验后美国继续进行核试验的政策遭到全世界舆论的尖锐谴责，最近结束的日内瓦核专家会议又作出了认为在技术上可以对停止核试验建立有效监督的结论，因此美国总统不得不在声明中作出这样的表示：美国“准备迅速着手同试验过核武器的其他国家谈判一项关于停止核武器试验和在专家报告的基础上实际建立一个国际监督制度问题的协议。”
    声明说，“美国准备——除非苏联恢复试验——在开始谈判后一年的期间内停止进一步试验原子武器和氢武器”。
    声明还说，“作为有待谈判的协议的一部分，并且在相互的基础上”，美国将来准备在逐年的基础上停止核试验，但是每年年初必须确定“建立并且有效地执行”视察制度，必须就“重大的武器监督措施达成协议”并且在执行方面取得“令人满意的进展”。
    声明提出的举行谈判的日期是今年10月31日。美国通讯社说，美国选择这个日期显然出于这样的考虑：到那时美国早已完成了它今年原来计划进行的一系列核试验。美国一些人士还认为，暂停试验一年也不会妨碍美国的原子扩军计划。
    白宫官员在评论艾森豪威尔的声明时说，如果认为美国将永久停止试验，那将是“错误”的。
    据新华社伦敦22日电　英国政府今晚发表声明宣布，由于日内瓦核专家会议结束，英国政府准备从10月31日起同“其他进行核武器试验的政府”就签订关于“在有效的国际监督下停止核武器试验”的协定进行会谈。
    像美国发表的关于这个问题的声明一样，英国政府的声明说，英国政府将从谈判开始时起，“在一年内，不再继续试验核武器”。但是，声明接着又为这一决定提出了一系列条件，这些条件是：凡进行过核武器试验的各国政府接受在10月31日开始就监督机构的组织、设立和职能等问题举行谈判的原则；苏联政府在上述规定期限内不恢复试验；英国政府准备“在此以后以一年为期的连续期限内停止进行核试验，如果苏联也这样做的话，以及如果在走向对停止核试验建立有效的国际监督制度方面，以及在走向采取和执行真正裁军的措施方面，已经取得了满意的进展的话。”
    英国政府还宣布，它将坚持只有在完成目前在圣诞岛进行的一系列试验以后，它才会这样做。
    在宣布停止核试验的同时，英国政府透露，今晚在圣诞岛曾经发生了核装置的爆炸。
