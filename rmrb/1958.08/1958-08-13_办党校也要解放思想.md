Running Party Schools Also Requires Emancipating the Mind
　　Zu Nian
    The district committees of the CCP's Xinhua, Hongqiao, Hexi, and Hebei districts in Tianjin have established Party schools. Based on current central tasks, they adopt methods of studying theory, summarizing work experience, and transforming thought to train party member cadres. The Xinhua District plans to train all section chiefs and grassroots party branch committee members in the district once this year, and all general party members and general party member cadres will be trained by 1959. This is a good way to improve the theoretical level of grassroots party member cadres quickly, effectively, and economically, and to promote the smooth completion of central tasks at all times.
    When discussing running Party schools, some district leaders always think that this is a matter for the central and provincial committees. They believe that their own theoretical level is low, they have no experience, and they have no theory teachers. Running a Party school is not an easy task! This is a mystical view of running Party schools and also a kind of "conditions-based theory." The Party school run by the Xinhua District Committee of the CCP breaks with conventions and proceeds from reality. It does not simply involve teachers lecturing and students listening, chewing on books, and taking notes. Instead, it combines reading documents, unleashing thinking, engaging in great debates, using big-character posters, and leaders giving guidance reports. Through repeated discussions, it achieves both the study of theory and the effect of transforming thought; it is neither bookish nor formulaic. These experiences tell us that running a Party school is not mysterious. As long as the mind is emancipated, one dares to think and act, the direction is correct, and the methods are practical, not only can district committees in large cities run Party schools, but district committees in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas can also run Party schools.
    There are also some people who are afraid of difficulties. Although cadres urgently need training, they wait to be sent to the prefectural and municipal Party schools in turn, or they say that they will run Party schools after the district committees have improved their theoretical level. Obviously, if everyone sits and waits for the higher authorities to train them without taking action, it will not be possible to educate and improve party members quickly, effectively, and economically. Waiting for the district committees to improve their theoretical level before doing anything is also unrealistic, and the true improvement of theoretical level can only be achieved when the party's principles, policies, and guidelines are closely integrated with the current practical struggles. In real life, it often happens that the more things you wait to do, the less likely they are to be realized. On the contrary, if you do not wait, but catch up and learn from experience in the process of doing, things will be done very well. The Xinhua District Committee of Tianjin did not lack difficulties at the beginning of running the Party school. For example, the district committee lacked experience in running Party schools, and there were no teachers, school buildings, and utensils. What should be done? They were not afraid of difficulties, nor did they hold a waiting mentality. Instead, they bravely got on their horses, gained experience while running the school, and the district party secretary and the district committee stepped forward to serve as teachers, and adopted the method of "guerrilla warfare" to solve the problem of school buildings, borrowing tables and stools. In this way, all the problems that were originally problems were solved easily, and the Party school was run very well.
    The vast number of grassroots working cadres are enthusiastic and have rich practical experience. At the same time, the specific implementation of the party's policies and guidelines mainly relies on them. They often excellently complete work and production tasks, creating miracles, but they cannot summarize and improve them theoretically, or there are certain shortcomings in their work and production, and they cannot find the key to leadership thinking and leadership methods. Therefore, the party's grassroots cadres urgently need to study theory, summarize work, transform thought, and improve understanding in order to better lead work and lead production. Under the situation of the socialist great leap forward, this requirement of the party's grassroots cadres is even more urgent. Party committees in various places need to emancipate their minds, eliminate the mystical view of running Party schools, overcome the waiting mentality, take action themselves, and run Party schools well to meet the requirements of the vast number of grassroots party member cadres, further improve their ideological and political level, so as to lead the masses and promote the comprehensive great leap forward of socialist construction.

　　办党校也要解放思想
　　祖年
    中共天津新华、红桥、河西、河北等四个区的区委办起了党校。他们根据当前中心任务，采取学习理论，总结工作经验，改造思想的办法，训练党员干部。新华区计划在今年内，把本区的科长和基层党支部委员一级的干部都轮训一次，1959年内，把一般党员和一般党员干部都轮训完毕。这是多快好省地提高基层党员干部的理论水平，推动各个时期中心工作任务顺利完成的好办法。
    有一些区的领导同志一谈起办党校，总认为这是中央和省委的事情，自己的理论水平低，没有经验，又没有理论教员，办党校不是轻而易举的啊！这是办党校的神秘观点，也是一种“条件论”。中共新华区委办的党校，破除陈规，从实际出发，不是单纯地先生讲学生听，拿着书本啃，抱着笔记记，而是阅读文件，大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报和领导做辅导报告相结合，经过反复讨论，既达到学习理论，又收到改造思想的效果；既没有秀才气，也没有八股腔。这些经验告诉我们，办党校并不神秘。只要思想解放，敢想敢干，方向对头，办法切实，不仅大城市中的区委可以办党校，就是中小城市和农村中的区委，也完全可以办党校。
    也有些人，怕困难，虽然干部迫切需要训练，他们却等待轮流派送地委和市委党校，或者说，等区委提高了理论水平以后再去办党校。显然，大家不动手，坐着等待上级来训练，就不能达到多快好省地教育和提高党员的目的；等待区委提高了理论水平再干，这也是不现实的，而且理论水平的真正提高，也只有在将党的原则、方针政策同当前各项实际斗争紧密结合的情况下才能得到。在现实生活里，往往有这样情况，越是要等待办的事情，越是不能实现，相反，不去等待，迎头赶上，在干的当中学经验，事情就办的很好。天津新华区委办党校之初，并不是没有困难的；例如：区委缺乏办党校的经验，没有教员、校舍和用具，怎么办？他们并没有怕困难，也没有抱着等待思想。而是勇敢地骑上马，一边办一边找经验，区委书记、区委都挺身而出担任教员，采取“打游击”的办法解决校舍问题，借用桌子、凳子。就这样，原来一切成为问题的问题，迎刃而解，而且把党校办的很出色。
    广大的基层工作干部，工作积极热情，有丰富的实际经验，同时，党的方针政策的具体贯彻，主要依靠他们去进行。他们往往出色地完成工作上和生产上的任务，创造出奇迹，但还不能从理论上加以总结和提高，或者工作上生产上存在着某些缺点，也找不到领导思想和领导方法上的关键所在。因此，党的基层干部迫切需要学习理论，总结工作，改造思想，提高认识，更好地来领导工作和领导生产。在社会主义大跃进的形势下，党的基层干部这种要求更加迫切了。各地党委有必要解放思想，破除对办党校的神秘观点，克服等待思想，自己动手，办好党校，来满足广大基层党员干部的要求，进一步提高他们的思想政治水平，以便带动群众，促进社会主义建设的全面大跃进。
