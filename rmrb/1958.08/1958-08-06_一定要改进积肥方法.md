    We Must Improve Manure Accumulation Methods
    The fact that Xushui County moved its pig farms from the villages to the fields has many benefits: it saves labor, increases grain production, prevents epidemics, and promotes environmental sanitation!
    The pig-raising industry is developing rapidly. In the first half of this year, the number of pigs raised has already exceeded the state's annual target. However, with more pigs, if they are all concentrated in villages, there will be many problems. For example, just the labor required to carry soil to line the pigsties and transport the pig manure to the fields would be enormous. This shows that pig raising and manure accumulation must now also pay attention to improving methods. If we act according to the old rules, our work will be passive. Therefore, the practice of Xushui County deserves special promotion.
    However, improving methods is not limited to pig raising. In the current production situation, all manure accumulation work must pay attention to improving methods. The requirements for improvement are: to improve fertilizer efficiency and save labor. For example, the practice of Yichang and other areas in Hubei Province of building manure ponds in the fields to compost fertilizer should be greatly promoted, because this can save a great deal of labor.

### 一定要改进积肥方法

    一定要改进积肥方法
    徐水县把养猪场从村子里搬到田野里去，能节省劳力，能增产粮食，能预防传染，又有利于环境卫生，好处真多！
    养猪事业发展很快，今年上半年养猪头数已经超过国家全年的指标。可是猪多了，如果都集中在村子里饲养，问题也就不少。比如单是挑土垫圈和把猪粪运到地里就不知需要花多少劳动力。足见养猪积肥现在也必需注意改进方法。如按老规章办事，就会使工作陷于被动。因此，徐水县的做法值得特别提倡。
    但是，要改进方法，又不仅限于养猪方面。在当前的生产形势下，一切积肥工作都必须注意改进方法。改进的要求是：提高肥效，节省劳力。例如，湖北宜昌等专区修田头粪垱，在田间沤肥，就值得大大提倡。因为这样可以节省大量劳力。
