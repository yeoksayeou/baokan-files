Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from Paris: Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Amintore Fanfani visited Paris on the 7th. On the 7th and 8th, Fanfani held talks with French Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle and Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville, respectively.

The joint communique issued on the 8th stated that both sides "studied the main aspects of the international situation, especially the Middle East issue" during the talks. The communique also stated that the two governments should conduct "closer and more frequent consultations" in the future.

Today, after the failure of the armed aggression policies of the United States and Britain in the Middle East, both France and Italy want to take the opportunity to insert their own influence into the Middle East region. France wants to win over some European countries to enhance its position, so that it will no longer be a "small partner" when dealing with the United States and Britain. To this end, France and Italy have recently conducted intensive diplomatic activities. The purpose of this meeting between the two governments was to gain each other's support for their plans.

According to Western news agencies, Fanfani explained to de Gaulle during the talks the so-called "Euro-American Aid to Middle Eastern Countries Plan" that he had proposed during his recent visits to Washington, London, and Bonn, the purpose of which was to allow Italian monopoly capital to also share a piece of the pie in economic aggression against the Middle East. De Gaulle expressed great approval for Fanfani's plan. Both sides also reached an agreement during the talks that European countries should discuss together issues that are of great significance to the future of Europe and the future of the Middle East. This may reveal the dissatisfaction of the French and Italian rulers with the fact that the United States and Britain did not consult with them when sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan. An Associated Press dispatch from Paris said: This agreement will enable France to participate in future top-level meetings as a representative of continental European countries.

Fanfani has already left Paris for Rome on the 8th after the talks. He told reporters at the Paris airport that at the special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Italian delegation would "stand on the side of its allies."

    范范尼和戴高乐会谈结束
    意法要在中东分一杯羹
    新华社9日讯　巴黎消息：意大利总理兼外交部长范范尼7日到巴黎访问。在7日和8日，范范尼分别同法国总理戴高乐和外交部长德姆维尔举行了会谈。
    8日发表的联合公报说，双方在会谈中“研究了国际局势的主要方面，特别是中东问题”。公报还说，两国政府以后要进行“更密切和更经常的磋商”。
    法国和意大利在美国和英国的武装侵略中东政策遭到失败的今天，都想乘机把自己的势力插入中东地区。法国更想拉拢一些欧洲国家以增强自己的地位，使自己在同美英打交道时不再做“小伙计”。为此目的，法意两国最近都曾进行了紧张的外交活动。两国政府这次会谈的目的，都在想使自己的计划获得对方的支持。
    据西方通讯社报道，范范尼在会谈中向戴高乐说明了他不久前访问华盛顿、伦敦和波恩时，都曾提出过的目的在使意大利垄断资本在对中东的经济侵略中也可以分享一杯羹的所谓“欧—美援助中东国家计划”，戴高乐对范范尼的计划表示了很大的赞同。双方还在会谈中达成协议，欧洲国家应当在对欧洲前途和中东前途有重要意义的问题一起进行商量。这里可能流露了法、意统治者对美、英出兵黎巴嫩和约旦时未同他们商量所存在的不满。美联社自巴黎发出的一则消息说：这个协议将使法国能够以欧洲大陆国家代表的身份去参加未来的最高级会议。
    范范尼已经在会谈结束后于8日离开巴黎回罗马。他在巴黎机场对记者说，在联合国大会特别紧急会议上，意大利代表团将“站在它盟国的一边”。
