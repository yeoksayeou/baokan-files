Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 17th: According to a report from the "Izvestia" special correspondent in New York to TASS, the situation at the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session discussing the issue of U.S. and British armed intervention in the Near East is becoming increasingly acute. The progress of the discussions is clearly unfavorable to the aggressors, reflecting the significant changes taking place inside and outside the United Nations.

The correspondent pointed out that the adventurous actions of the United States and Britain in the Near East have been criticized by the vast majority of national delegations. In this situation, the scope for diplomatic maneuvering by the aggressors has been greatly reduced. It has also become more difficult for them to send their apologists from vassal states to the podium to defend them. These loyal servants of the United States, fearing public anger, prefer to temporarily stay off the podium and even cancel their scheduled speeches. Such situations can be seen every day. For example, the representatives of Peru and Canada, who originally requested to speak on August 15, did not dare to come forward.

The tone of American newspaper commentators has also changed significantly. After two days of praising Eisenhower's speech, they felt somewhat of a headache. Increasingly, there are comments in the newspapers expressing doubts about the realism of the President's plan.

In view of the unfavorable situation for them at the emergency meeting, the American ruling circles are trying every possible means to mobilize the forces that are still loyal to them, and are using these forces at all costs to force the General Assembly to pass a resolution to cover up the aggressors' policy in the Near East and to bury the issue of demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

According to American newspapers, a proposal is being prepared outside the meeting, and the drafter of this proposal is said to be Norway. This proposal defends the actions of the United States and Britain in the Arab East, and suggests that the United Nations take actions to delay the days of U.S. and British troops occupying Lebanon and Jordan.

The Japanese delegation, headed by Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama, also played an indecent role in this regard. His speech on August 15 essentially defended the actions of the United States, although using some vague statements.

It is reported that Fujiyama's speech was revised three times, and the content became milder each time in terms of assessing the aggressive actions of the United States.

American representatives are also working hard on the representatives of Latin American countries, sometimes persuading, sometimes intimidating, and sometimes directly threatening.

The "Izvestia" reporter concluded by writing that, therefore, at the United Nations meeting—inside and outside the meeting—the forces of peace and the forces of war are engaged in a fierce struggle. Peace-loving countries are making every effort to promote the United Nations General Assembly to actively resolve the main issue of the withdrawal of aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

### 美国侵略者处境空前孤立　要寻找帮凶已越来越困难——“消息报”特派记者评联大紧急会议

　　美国侵略者处境空前孤立
　　要寻找帮凶已越来越困难
　　——“消息报”特派记者评联大紧急会议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：据“消息报”特派记者自纽约报道，讨论美英武装干涉中近东问题的联合国大会紧急特别会议的情况具有越来越尖锐的性质。讨论的进展显然是对侵略者不利的，这反映了联合国内外发生的重大变化。
    记者指出，美英两国在近东的冒险行动已经遭到绝大多数国家代表团的指责。在这种情况下，侵略者要在外交上玩弄花招的范围已大大缩小了。他们要把仆从国中他们的辩护人送上讲坛为他们辩护也更加困难了。这些美国的忠实仆从由于害怕公众的愤怒，宁愿暂时不登上讲坛，甚至取消了预定的发言。这样的情况每天都可以看到。譬如，原来要求在8月15日发言的秘鲁和加拿大两国的代表就没有敢出来讲话。
    美国报纸评论员的口气也显著地改变了。他们对艾森豪威尔的演说进行了两天颂扬以后，感到有些头痛了。报上越来越频繁地出现人们对总统计划的现实性表示怀疑的言论。
    鉴于紧急会议上这种于己不利的局面，美国统治集团正千方百计地动员仍旧忠于它们的势力、并且不惜代价地利用这些势力来迫使大会通过决定，以便为侵略者在中近东的政策遮丑，并且埋葬掉要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。
    据美国报纸报道，会外有人正在准备一项提案，这个提案的起草人据说是挪威。这项提案为美英两国在阿拉伯东方的行动辩护，并且建议联合国采取行动拖延美英军队占领黎巴嫩和约旦的时日。
    以日本外务相藤山为首的日本代表团在这方面也充当了不体面的角色，他在8月15日的发言实质上是为美国的行动辩护，虽然是采用一些含糊其词的说法。
    据悉，藤山的发言稿经过三次修改，在触及对美国的侵略行动作估计的地方，内容一次比一次温和。
    美国代表也在拉丁美洲国家代表身上大力进行工作，一会儿劝说，一会儿恫吓，一会儿又直接进行威胁。
    “消息报”记者最后写道，因此，在联合国会议上——会内和会外——和平力量和战争势力正在进行着尖锐的斗争。爱好和平的国家正在尽一切努力促使联合国大会能够积极地解决侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦这个主要问题。
