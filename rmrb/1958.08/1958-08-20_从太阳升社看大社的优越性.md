Seeing the Superiority of Large Communes from the Sun Rises Commune
　　Lin Wei

During April and May this year, Liaoning Province carried out a movement to merge into larger communes throughout the province. Now, the province averages about 1,800 households per commune. The largest commune in the province is the Sun Rises Commune in Huayuantuo Township, Gaiping County.

In late July, I and a comrade from Liaoning visited this large commune together. This large commune is about forty *li* long and wide, with a total of more than 18,000 households and more than 95,000 people, practically a small county. Before May this year, this place consisted of seven communes of two thousand-odd households each, which were also seven townships. Now, the seven communes have merged into one large commune, and the seven townships have also merged into one township, remaining one township and one commune. Because the commune members fervently yearn for communism, everyone unanimously agreed to name it "Sun Rises Communist Farm" during the commune merger, with eleven operational areas and ninety-eight production teams. Preparations are underway to implement a wage system starting next year, and to turn over profits to the state starting the year after next. The method for implementing the wage system is to distribute 60% of this year's cash in advance (this commune distributes about 1.50 yuan per work day), with the remaining 40% used as a wage reserve fund, and to pre-pay monthly starting in March next year. Each household, based on an average of two laborers, can pre-pay a total of twenty yuan in cash per month. Afterwards, it will gradually become a monthly salary system.

Grain distribution will also change the current method. Grain storage will be built near the grain processing plants, and after unified processing, it will be distributed to commune members (referred to here as staff) at a fixed quota for consumption, or delivered to the canteens. This will eliminate back and forth transport.

The large commune concentrates the masses' demands and adopts a series of measures to eliminate the private economy:

First, each household's small vegetable gardens are collectivized, and the production team or operational area centrally plants vegetables as needed, with a special vegetable store delivering vegetables to the door every day, guaranteeing quantity and quality. The price is also cheap. Commune members purchase with vegetable coupons. The benefits of doing this are: lower cost, higher yield, and a full variety of vegetables compared to individual planting; it also saves private households from competing with the commune for labor, fertilizer, and funds (households that are too scattered are still allowed three *li* of vegetable plot per person).

Second, the payments for carts, horses, farm tools, fishing boats, and fishing nets that have not yet been repaid will no longer be repaid (this item has not been finalized; some advocate delayed repayment).

Third, existing fruit trees and shade trees beside houses are transferred to the commune without compensation.

Fourth, private tailors and barbershops are transferred to the commune. Small vendors are eliminated, and the commune's stores operate.

Fifth, private houses can be self-occupied. If rented out, the income goes to the commune, and repairs are also the responsibility of the commune. If private houses affect production or unified planning, the commune can demolish them and allocate other houses without charging rent. In addition, the commune will systematically build new houses and construct beautiful new villages.

In order to break superstitions and increase arable land, existing graves are all moved for deep burial. Some factory buildings and kiln walls are built with tombstones. The general farmers have no complaints about this. When we visited the lime kiln, the people on the kiln automatically pointed out the tombstones on the kiln wall to us, looking a little boastful, meaning that the farmers are no longer superstitious.

In order to build the farm and realize communism, the farmers voluntarily stated during the merger that they were willing to give up the money owed to them by the original communes for carts, horses, etc., and many people voluntarily donated their hidden gold, silver, copper, iron, silver ingots, and silver dollars.

This place is not yet a state-owned farm. If the monthly salary system is implemented next year, it will not be equivalent to "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" communism. Moreover, calling it a farm or still calling it an agricultural production cooperative is not entirely appropriate, because it is no longer a purely agricultural production organization. In addition to agriculture, there is also animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, salt production, apple orchards, and tussah silkworms. In addition, there are ninety-eight factories and mines, including food and feed processing plants, brick kilns, lime kilns, iron furnaces, cotton gins, and wineries. There are also many stores and credit organizations, schools and hospitals... These undertakings and enterprises, agricultural and sideline production, are led and managed by the Production Technology, Finance and Economics, Mechanical and Electrical, Infrastructure, Animal Husbandry, and Culture, Education, and Health Committees.

Although communism has not yet been achieved, the pace of progress towards communism has been greatly accelerated by the expansion of the commune. Many things that could not be done before are now being done smoothly. Things that used to take many years to accomplish will now be accomplished quickly.

　The speed of mechanization and electrification has greatly accelerated

Mechanization and electrification have always been thought of as distant things. Now it seems that they will be realized soon. This commune now has one steamship, five trucks, and will continue to increase them. There are already sixteen tractors, equivalent to twenty standard units. Next year, it is planned to develop to eighty standard units (including six Stalin 80 large tractors), and all farmland will be cultivated by machines. There are already fifty-six electric motors and other power machines, and some more will be added next year to mechanize all agricultural product processing and farmland irrigation. The power source comes from the national power station, and twenty *li* of high-voltage lines have already been erected. Thirty-odd production teams have already installed electric lights. Next year, it is planned to erect another twenty *li* to light up all farmhouses in the commune. The large commune and several operational areas now have their own broadcasting stations (wired), which are as large as the Gaiping County broadcasting station. There are now more than 2,200 loudspeakers, and radio music and other propaganda programs can be heard in large and small villages. In terms of transportation, it is planned to have trolley buses or four or five buses next year, specifically for transporting passengers.

The main guarantee for achieving mechanization and electrification at high speed is that funds can now be used on a large scale. In the past two years, the seven communes have accumulated a total of 1.67 million yuan. This year, after merging into one commune, the planned total value of production is 25 million yuan (due to the drought, the actual figure may be slightly lower), and the commune's accumulation (excluding production costs) is one-fifth, about 5 million yuan. According to the calculations of the commune leaders, it will only cost 2 million yuan to implement mechanization after the autumn harvest this year. Obviously, as long as the central and local industrial departments can produce enough machinery and electrical appliances, there is no problem with the purchasing power here.

　The speed of agricultural basic construction has greatly accelerated

The original Dongguang Commune spent from March to June this year building a reservoir with 90,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and only completed 30,000 cubic meters. It looked like it wouldn't be ready for use this year. But after the merger, the large commune concentrated more than 1,500 people and many carts, trucks, and tractors, and completed the remaining 60,000 cubic meters of earthwork in just twelve days. The original Red Flag Farm Commune planned to complete a seawall with 50,000 cubic meters of earthwork in twenty days with 1,500 people. Now, the large commune concentrated 15,000 people and completed it in eight hours. There are many such examples.

But this is just the beginning. After the autumn harvest this year, the large commune will start to build a large coastal dam to prevent seawater from coming ashore and land water from entering the sea. This can develop 500 *qing* (one *qing* equals fifteen *mu*) of fishing port, 1,000 *qing* of salt fields, and 2,000 *qing* of virgin paddy fields, which can increase salt production by 70 million *jin* per year, fish by 2 million *jin*, and grain by 50 million *jin*, worth a total of 6 million yuan. But this project is very large, requiring 2 million workdays. In the past, the farmers of two communes had this intention, but they could not do it: first, there was not enough manpower; second, the interests of each commune were not entirely consistent, each had small plans, and they could not organize it. The farmers said, "Everyone sees it as a piece of fat meat, but they can't eat it." Now that the communes have merged, the problem has been solved. The large commune is preparing to concentrate 20,000 people to complete this project in 100 days.

Learning from the lessons of this year's severe drought, the large commune is preparing to concentrate its efforts after the autumn harvest to drill 150 deep wells of 30 to 40 meters, all using electric water pumps, to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest next year even if there is no surface water. Drilling wells uses electric drills, and one deep well takes only three days. This work will be completed before National Day this year. The existing deep wells (all machine wells) have played a major role in the drought resistance this year.

In terms of soil and water conservation, 200 ordinary flood control dams will be built this year, so that hilly areas can also store water and irrigate fields. This will be completely "water conservancy-ized."

In addition, before the spring plowing next year, 3,000 *qing* of saline-alkali land will be transformed, with 400,000 *jin* of yellow mud and 20,000 *jin* of manure padded on one *qing*, which can raise the cultivated land by three inches.

There are also many plans for deep plowing, afforestation, and housing construction, which will not be listed.

The guarantee for completing these huge plans, in addition to the large-scale centralized use of funds, the large-scale unified allocation of manpower is the decisive factor. The unified allocation of large communes is much more convenient and effective than the organization and coordination between small communes.

　Natural disasters can no longer overwhelm the farmers

What the East loses the West will gain, what this industry does not yield that industry will, disasters will naturally be eliminated, and commune members' income and life will have greater guarantees.

Whether it is agriculture, fishery, or apples, there are good and bad years. From a spatial point of view, every year either these villages have disasters or those villages have disasters. Therefore, the income and life of commune members were still not fully guaranteed under the conditions of small communes (although it is superior to the individual economy). Now it's good: everyone unites into a large commune, this village has a disaster, that village has a bumper harvest, if agriculture has a disaster, industry and sideline businesses can make up for it (this is the case this year). The rural people, who have been ravaged by natural disasters for centuries, can now break free. Their income has a definite guarantee.

Will "poor communes" drag down "rich communes"? No. Some small communes, such as the Henan Village Commune, were very poor, but they did not hold back other communes after merging into the large commune. On the contrary, everyone became richer, and this poor commune also became rich. The reason is that the large commune concentrated its efforts here to drill deep wells, erect electric wires, and develop 180 *qing* of paddy fields, greatly increasing production.

Because income is guaranteed and relatively high, the farmers here also live relatively well. Many people ride bicycles, wear watches, and have radios at home. People dress about the same as in Beijing. Many of the girls working in the fields are dressed like girls going to dance. They have not only generally caught up with the rich middle peasants, but also surpassed them.

In terms of agricultural production, in the era of small communes, each commune had to plant grain on land suitable for cotton and cotton on land suitable for grain in order to be self-sufficient (this situation still existed here last year). Now that the commune is large, it can plant flexibly according to the characteristics of the land, give full play to land fertility, which also reduces disasters and increases income.

Each village has more or less labor, some have a surplus and some have a shortage. Communes with insufficient labor often have some "third-class fields." Communes with surplus labor cannot fully utilize the role of people. What about now? The large commune can transfer a large number of people from the teams with more labor to support the teams with insufficient labor, to eliminate third-class fields and third-class seedlings, to eliminate pests, and to irrigate and resist drought. This year, there was a severe drought in the local area. There was no rain from seedling emergence to heading (during the hot season). But because it was possible to organize a strong shock force to irrigate, most of the crops were rescued. This could not be done in the past. When we visited, the drought-stricken area was simply full of people, carrying water, digging pits and rivers, men and women, young and old, working in three shifts, day and night. People were so enthusiastic and full of energy.

In terms of animal husbandry, in the era of small communes, some communes had funds to develop animal husbandry but no pastures, and some communes had large pastures that were left idle. Now, the unified use of pastures greatly facilitates the development of animal husbandry. Now, the large commune has formulated a plan for large-scale development of animal husbandry next year.

　Industry is accelerating its development

In this year's planned income of the entire commune, industry and sideline businesses account for about one-third, about 8 million yuan. In fact, it may exceed this, because the crops have been affected by the severe drought and cannot reach the plan, and it is planned to earn an additional 5 million yuan in industry and sideline businesses to compensate. Next year, industry and sideline businesses will expand sharply, with the planned output value increasing to 25 million yuan.

Developing industry requires funds, raw materials, workers, and technical personnel. Raw materials are still mainly produced by the commune (such as grain) and collected (such as scrap iron). Next year, it is planned to build fertilizer plants and machinery plants, mainly relying on local collection of raw materials. In the past, the main shortage was funds and people, but now these two problems are easier to solve than before. Smaller equipment can be purchased by itself. It is relatively easy to gather technical personnel in hundreds of villages: demobilized soldiers, technical workers and craftsmen who have worked outside before, and so on. There are already 1,500 general workers. Because the commune is large and there are many people, even the large drought resistance does not require them to take part. The stability is relatively high, and they can work for many years. It will be easy to solve the problem of needing to increase workers in the future. Just draw some people from the various production teams. At present, the unanimous feeling is that there are still too few factories, and it is believed that there should not only be ninety-eight, but hundreds. In fact, it is already being actively developed.

The increase in manpower, financial resources, and material resources has changed people's horizons and courage. The mines that the Japanese tried to develop but did not have time to develop will now be developed. Mines that were not discovered before are now being discovered. On the beaches by the sea, people enthusiastically open the floating sand by hand and grab the heavy black iron sand. The iron sand area is very large, and the county's company has begun to buy it. The large commune is also preparing to mine and smelt it itself after surveying and clarifying the reserves. The mines that are already being mined include phosphate-magnesium ore, silica ore, fluorite, talc, mica, and granite. As long as there is no problem with sales, these mines can bring a lot of income to the commune.

In order to mine, the large commune is preparing to build its own railway. The first is from the granite mine to Gaiping Station, dozens of *li* long.

　Cultural and educational and welfare undertakings are developing greatly

Here, in addition to many self-run primary schools, there are also six middle schools, and plans to continue to develop them. There are also plans to establish an agricultural university. There are currently more than thirty spare-time schools, and it is planned to develop them to ninety, so that every team has one.

The large commune now has two hospitals, dozens of beds, the same scale as a county hospital. There are nine health clinics, two of which will soon be converted into hospitals. There are a total of 130 doctors, nurses, and midwives. The hospitals here do not have the "system" of large hospitals. Doctors often go to various places for outpatient services and arrive as soon as they are asked. They treat door-to-door for infectious diseases. Their slogan is "Medicine delivered to the door." When emergency patients come, they are treated without waiting to register, and they have a very close relationship with the patients. Hospitalization costs only five *jiao* per day, and simple hospital beds (family care) cost only two *jiao*. Many old Chinese medicine practitioners have also dedicated their family secret recipes to the Party and collect herbs themselves in the mountains, saving money for the hospital. They are all willing to contribute to communism. One hospital we visited has an average of 500 people coming for medical treatment every day, half of whom are from outside the commune.

Sewing, hairdressing, laundering, and other service industries are developing rapidly. Children are organized into more than 100 nurseries and kindergartens according to age. Public canteens and bathhouses are being actively established. There are more than 40 amateur theater troupes and more than 100 clubs, the largest of which has eleven. One we visited can accommodate one or two thousand people. There are currently fifty-eight libraries, but there are not enough books and newspapers, and they are actively increasing them. Next year, it is planned to buy three film projectors to show movies to each team.

From an economic point of view, this large commune is like a conglomerate. But it is not only an economic organization, but also includes many other undertakings. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it a "people's commune." However, it does not have the function of dictatorship, which still belongs to the township. The party organizations of the township and commune are the same team.

　　从太阳升社看大社的优越性
　　林韦
    辽宁省今年4、5月间在全省范围内进行了并大社运动。现在全省平均，每社有一千八百来户。全省最大的社，是盖平县花园坨乡的太阳升社。
    7月下旬，我和辽宁一位同志共同参观了这个大社。这个大社长宽都有四十来里，总共有一万八千多户，九万五千多人口，简直是一个不很小的县。今年5月份以前，这里是七个二千几百户的社，也是七个乡。现在七个社合成了一个大社，七个乡也合成了一个乡，仍然是一乡一社。由于社员们热烈地向往共产主义，并社时大家一致同意定名为“太阳升共产主义农场”，下设十一个作业区，九十八个生产队。准备从明年起开始推行工资制，从后年开始向国家上缴利润。推行工资制的办法，是今年的现金先分配十分之六（这个社一个劳动日分一元五角左右），以所余十分之四作为工资储备金，明年3月起按月预支。每户以平均二个劳动力计，一月共可预支二十元现金。以后即逐步成为月薪制。
    粮食分配也将改变现行办法，在粮食加工厂附近修建粮仓，统一加工后按定量分给社员（这里称职工）食用，或交食堂。这样可以免除来回搬运。
    大社集中群众要求，采取一系列办法消灭私有经济：
    一、各户小菜园归公，由生产队或作业区按需要集中种菜，由专设的菜店每天送菜上门，保证数量和质量。价钱也便宜。社员凭菜票购买。这里认为这样做的好处是：比个体种菜成本低、产量高、品种全；还省得私人与社争劳力、争肥料、争资金（太分散的户每人仍给留三厘菜地）。
    二、现在尚未偿还的车马、农具、渔船、鱼网等入社价款，不再偿还（这条还未最后肯定，有人主张缓期偿还）。
    三、现有屋边果树，荫宅树木，无代价归社。
    四、私营裁缝、理发店归社。取消小商贩，由社的商店经营。
    五、私人房屋可自住。如向外租典，收入归社，修补也由社负责。私人房屋如影响生产和统一规划，社可拆除，另分给房屋，不收租。另外，社将有计划地逐步统一盖新房，建设漂亮的新农村。
    为破除迷信，增加耕地，原有坟墓一律迁移深葬。有一些厂房和窑壁，就是用墓碑造的。一般农民对此并无不满。我们参观石灰窑的时候，窑上的人们自动把窑壁上的墓碑指示给我们，看神气还有点炫耀，意思是说农民早就不迷信了。
    农民为了建场，为了实现共产主义，合并时都自动申明愿意放弃原社欠自己的车马等价款，许多人自动献出家藏的金银铜铁、元宝和现洋。
    这里现在还不是国营农场。明年如果实行了月薪制，也并不就等于“各取所需”的共产主义。而且，叫做农场，或仍叫农业生产合作社，都不完全恰当，因为它现在已经不是单纯的农业生产组织了。这里除了农业，还有畜牧业、林业、渔业、盐业、苹果园、柞蚕。另外还有九十八处厂矿，其中包括粮食、饲料的加工厂，砖窑、灰窑、铁炉、轧花、酿酒等厂。还有许多的商店和信用组织，学校和医院……。这些事业和企业、农副业生产，分别由生产技术、财经、机电、基建、畜牧、文教卫生等委员会领导和管理。
    共产主义虽然还没有达到，但向着共产主义前进的步伐却因社的扩大而大大加快了。许多从前办不到的事情，现在顺利地办到了。从前要好多年才能办到的事情，现在很快就要办到了。
  机械化和电气化
  的速度大大加快了
    机械化和电气化，人们一直以为是遥远的事情。现在看来却是很快就要实现的了。这个社现在已经有了汽船一只，载重汽车五辆，还将继续增加。拖拉机已有十六台，合二十标准台。明年计划发展到八十标准台（包括斯大林八十号大拖拉机六台），农田全部机耕。电动机和其他动力机现在已有五十六部，明年再增加一些，使农产品加工和农田灌溉全部机械化。电源来自国家电站，现在已架高压线二十里。三十来个生产队已经点上电灯。明年计划再架二十里，全社所有农户都点电灯。大社和好几个作业区，现在都有了自己的广播站
  （有线），大的和盖平县广播站一样大。广播喇叭现在已有二千二百多个，大小村庄都可以听到广播音乐和其他宣传节目。交通方面，明年准备搞无轨电车，或者搞四五辆公共汽车，专门送客。
    高速度实现机械化和电气化的主要保证，是资金现在可以大规模地集中使用了。两年来七个社积累资金共达一百六十七万元。今年合并成一社，计划生产总值二千五百万元（因旱灾，实际可能稍低于此数），社的积累（生产成本不在内）为五分之一，约五百万元。社的领导人们计算的结果，今年秋后实行机械化只需要二百万元。很明显，只要中央和地方工业部门能够生产出足够的机械和电器，这里的购买能力是完全没有问题的。
  农业基本建设的
    速度大大加快
    原东光社修一个九万土方工程的水库，从今年3月修到6月，只做了三万土方。眼看今年用不上了。但在并社以后，大社集中了一千五百多人和许多大车、汽车、拖拉机，只突击了十二天就把所余的六万土方工程全部完成了。原红旗场社修一段五万土方工程的海堤，计划一千五百人修二十天可以完成。现在大社集中一万五千人，八个小时突击完成了。这类例子很多。
    但这只是开始。今年秋收一过，大社就要开始兴修一条海防大坝，使海水不能上岸，陆地水不能入海。这样可以开发五百垧（一垧十五亩）鱼港，一千垧盐田，二千垧生荒水田，每年可以增产盐七千万斤，鱼二百万斤，粮食五千万斤，总共值六百万元。但这项工程很大，需要二百万工日。过去有两个社农民早有此意，但做不到：一来人力不够，二来各社利害不完全一致，各有小打算，组织不起来，农民说：“谁也看到是块肥肉，就是吃不上。”现在并了大社，问题解决了。大社准备集中两万人用一百天来突击完成这项工程。
    接受今年大旱的教训，大社准备秋收后集中力量打三四十公尺的深井一百五十眼，全用电力抽水，保证明年地面无水也能全面丰收。打井用电钻，一眼深井只用三天。这项工作要在今年国庆前后提前完成。已有的深井（都是机井），在今年抗旱中起了重大的作用。
    水土保持方面，今年要修二百道普通拦洪坝，使丘陵地也都能蓄水灌田。这样就完全“水利化”了。
    另外，明年春耕以前要改造三千垧盐碱地，一垧垫四十万斤黄泥，二万斤粪，这可以使耕地升高三寸。
    还有深翻地、植树造林、房屋建筑等许多计划，不列举了。
    完成这些巨大计划的保证，除了大规模的资金集中使用之外，大规模的人力统一调配是决定性的因素。大社的统一调配，比小社之间组织协作要方便得多，效果也大得多。
    自然灾害再也
    压不倒农民了
    东方不亮西方亮，这行不收那行收，灾荒自然消灭，社员的收入和生活有了更大的保证。
    不论农业也好，渔业也好，苹果也好，都有丰年歉年之分。从空间来看，每年不是这一些村庄有灾，就是那一些村庄有灾。所以社员们的收入和生活在小社条件下还是没有充分保证的（虽然同个体经济相比它是优越的）。现在好了：大家联合成大社，这村有灾，那村丰收，农业有灾，工业和副业上可以赶回来（今年的情况就是这样）。多少世纪以来一直受着自然灾害蹂躏的农村人民，现在可以摆脱了。他们的收入有了确定的保证。
    “穷社”会不会拖“富社”的腿呢？不。有的小社，如河南村社，原来很穷，但并入大社后并未拖住别的社。相反的，大家都更富了，这个穷社也变富了。原因是大社集中力量在这里打了深井，架了电线，开发水田一百八十垧，大大提高了产量。
    由于收入有保证，而且较多，这里农民生活也较富裕。骑自行车的，带手表的，家里有收音机的人很多。人们穿着和北京差不多。在田里劳动的姑娘们，有许多穿的像去跳舞的姑娘似的。他们不仅一般地赶上了富裕中农，而且超过了。
    农业生产方面，小社时期各社为了自给，不得不在宜棉地上种谷，宜谷地上种棉（这里去年还有这种情形）。现在社大了，可以根据土地特点灵活种植，充分发挥地力，这也减少了灾害，增加了收入。
    各村劳动力有多有少，有有余有不足。劳力不足的社，时常要有一部分“三类田”。劳力有余的社，人的作用不能充分发挥。现在呢？大社可以从劳力多的队大量调人去支援劳力不足的队，突击消灭三类田三类苗，突击除虫，突击浇水抗旱。今年当地大旱，从出苗到莠穗（三伏）一直没有透雨。但因能够组织起强大的突击力量来浇水，所以大部分农作物都抢救出来了。这在过去是做不到的。我们去参观的时候，受旱地带简直漫山遍野都是人，抬水的，担水的，挖坑挖河的，男女老幼，分三班劳动，日夜不停。人们是那样地兴致勃勃，充满活力。
    畜牧方面，在小社时期，有的社有资金发展畜牧而没有牧场，有的社有大片牧场却空闲不用。现在统一使用牧场，大大便利了畜牧业的发展。现在，大社已经制定了明年大规模发展畜牧业的计划。
  工业在加速发展
    在今年全社的计划收入中，工业和副业共占三分之一左右，约八百万元。事实上可能超过，因为农作物受大旱的影响达不到计划，准备在工业和副业上多赚五百万元来抵偿。明年，工业和副业都将猛烈扩大，产值计划增至二千五百万元。
    发展工业需要资金、原料、工人和技术人材。原料现在主要还是本社生产的（如粮食）和搜集的
  （如废铁）。明年准备搞肥料厂，机械厂，也主要靠当地搜集原材料。过去主要缺资金，缺人，现在这两方面的问题都比从前好解决了。不太大的设备，都能自己购买。技术人材，在百十个村庄凑集是比较容易的：复员军人啦，从前在外面干过的技术工人和匠人啦，等等。一般工人，现在已有一千五百人。由于社大人多，现在甚至大抗旱也用不到他们出马。固定性比较大，能长年干。将来需要增加工人，也很容易解决，从各个生产队抽一些人就行了。目前人们一致的感觉是工厂仍然太少，认为不仅应该有九十八个，而且应该有好几百个。实际上也已经在积极发展。
    人力、财力和物力的增大，使人们的眼界和胆量都不同了。以前日本人试图开发而没有来得及开发的矿，现在都要开发。以前没有发现的矿，现在开始发现。在海边的沙滩上，人们兴致勃勃地用手拨开浮沙，抓起了沉甸甸的黑色的铁沙。铁沙地片很大，县的公司已开始收买。大社也准备在勘察清楚蕴量以后自己开采、冶炼。现在已经在开采的，有磷镁矿，硅石矿，萤石矿，滑石矿，云母矿，花岗岩。只要销路不出问题，这些矿都可以给社带来很多的收入。
    为了开矿，大社准备自己修建铁路。首先是从花岗岩矿修到盖平车站，长几十里。
  文化教育和福利
      事业大发展
    这里现在除了许多自办的小学，还办了中学六处，准备继续发展。还准备兴办农业大学一所。现有业余学校三十多处，准备发展到九十处，做到队队都有。
    大社现在有两个医院，几十个床位，规模同县医院一样大。卫生所九个，其中两个大的很快也要改成医院。医生、护士、助产士一共一百三十来人。这里的医院没有大医院那一套“制度”，医师经常到各处出诊，随请随到。有流行传染病时挨门诊治。他们的口号是“医药送上门”。急诊病人来了，不等挂号就治，同病人关系非常亲密。住院一天只要五角钱，简易病床
  （家属看护）只要二角。许多老中医把家传秘方也献给了党，并自己入山采药，给医院省钱。他们都愿意为共产主义出一把力。我们访问的一个医院，每天平均有五百人来看病，其中一半是社外的人。
    缝纫、理发、浆洗等服务行业在迅速发展。儿童按年龄组织了一百多个托儿所和幼儿园。公共食堂和澡堂正在积极建立。业余剧团有四十多个，俱乐部有一百多个，大的十一个。我们参观的一个能容一、二千人。图书室现有五十八处，但书报还不够多，正积极增加。明年计划买三部电影放映机到各队放映电影。
    这个大社从经济方面看，像个联合企业。但它又不仅是经济组织，而包括着另外许多事业。如果称为“人民公社”，也许是更恰当的。不过它没有专政的职能，专政职能现仍归乡。乡社的党组织则是一套人马。
