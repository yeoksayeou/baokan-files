    Happily Celebrating "August 1st" and Praising the East Wind
    Ge De
    This year's "August 1st" is different from previous years. First, this year is the year of the Great Leap Forward; second, this year's "August 1st" arrives amidst the tense situation in the Middle East.
    The people's army's Great Leap Forward makes the people very happy. Because it shows that the East Wind is even stronger and victory is more consolidated. Walking on the road, looking ahead to the future, one feels the road is long; but when looking back at the journey traversed, it feels very short. Thirty-one years of combat history have seen our army develop from the "millet plus rifle" stage to a modern stage.
    Before, that "millet plus rifle" was actually a general description; at times, it was just chaff and vegetables plus knives and spears, or even loyal thoughts plus bare hands. However, it was powerful, because in addition to having thoughts and hands, it also had the people as its impregnable wall. It was the Party that combined all these powerful factors into an indestructible force.
    Today, our army is even more powerful. Yesterday's People's Daily reported that our air force is "increasingly reaching the 'all-weather' flight level"; the navy has "all-around sailors"; and the infantry and armored forces have "all-around gunners" and "all-around riflemen." This can be called "four alls," right? "All-weather," what a spirited term. On July 29th, in an air battle against U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes, four against four, in just two minutes, we shot down and damaged three enemy planes. And ours all returned victoriously. This can be considered a glimpse of "all-weather." But this is not the main point. Our troops have two more important kinds of four alls. One is, as Vice Chairman Zhu De said, "ideologically, politically, organizationally, and in terms of equipment and technology, we have achieved great successes." When we were lacking in technical equipment, we defeated countless enemies stronger than us because of the strength of our "ideology, politics, and organization." Now that we not only have powerful technical equipment, but also have further improved our "ideology, politics, and organization," what can stop this power? The second is that the Party, as the leader of the troops, has a higher level of Marxism-Leninism; the 600 million people, as the backing of the troops, have achieved unprecedented ideological liberation, this force is stronger than 600 million atomic bombs; science and industry, as the technical and material foundation of the troops, have made leaps in development; plus the powerful troops themselves, isn't this just another bigger four alls. "Four alls," "four alls," and again "four alls," our army is a four-all divine army, invincible.
    "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" naturally refers to the forces of peace-loving and independence-seeking in the entire world far surpassing the imperialist aggressor forces, but in this East Wind, we must first see the people's own armed forces. The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army are brothers. It is these two powerful armies standing shoulder to shoulder, as well as the powerful forces of the socialist camp, that are the backbone of the world peace camp and the greatest guarantee of world peace. The U.S. and British imperialists sent troops to the Middle East, aggressively, but they dare not easily fire their guns as they did on the Korean battlefield, precisely because they fear this powerful force. They certainly understand that although the direct target of the attack is only the six million people of Iraq, they must first see that "standing at the forefront of defending world peace" is the powerful force of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. This is the main thing that gives the imperialists a headache. It is also what we should wholeheartedly praise.
    Long live the East Wind! Long live the people's army!

### 欣逢“八一”颂东风

    欣逢“八一”颂东风
    葛德
    今年的“八一”不同往年。第一，今年是大跃进年；第二，今年的“八一”是在中东的紧张局势中到来的。
    人民的军队大跃进。人民就大高兴。因为这说明着东风更高，胜利更巩固。迈步在行途上，瞻望前程的时候，觉得路是漫长的；但当回顾跨越过的路程时，却又觉得它很短。三十一年的战斗历史，使我们的军队从“小米加步枪”的阶段发展到现代化的阶段了。
    以前，那“小米加步枪”，其实也是指的一般；在有些时候，又只是糠菜加刀矛，甚或是忠诚的思想加赤手空拳。然而，它是强大的，原因就在于它除了有思想、有手足以外，还背靠有铜墙铁壁一般的人民。是党，把这一切强大的因素组成了一个无坚不摧的力量的。
    今天我们这支军队，更是无比的强大了。昨天的人民日报报道说：我们的空军是“越来越多的达到了‘全天侯’的飞行水平”；海军中有“全能水兵”；步兵和装甲兵中有“全能炮手”和“全能枪手”。这可以称作“四全”吧。“全天侯”，这是多么有神采的称呼呵。7月29日，我们对美制蒋机的一场空战，四对四，只两分钟，就打落和打伤了敌机三架。而我们的是全部胜利返航，这可算是“全天侯”的一斑。然而这还不是主要的。我们的部队还有更为重要的两种四全。其一，是像朱德副主席所说的“思想上、政治上、组织上和装备技术上，都获得了巨大的成绩。”我们在技术装备上差的时候，曾因为“思想上、政治上、组织上”的强而战胜过无数个比我们强大的敌人。现在我们不仅有了强大的技术装备，而且“思想上、政治上、组织上”也有了更进一步提高，这威力还有什么东西可以阻挡呢？其二，是作为部队的领导的党，有了更高的马克思列宁主义水平；作为部队的靠山的六亿人民，获得了空前的思想解放，这力量是赛得过六亿颗原子弹的；作为部队的技术和物质基础的科学和工业有了飞跃的发展；再加上强大的部队本身，这不正好又是一个更大的四全。“四全”“四全”再“四全”，我们的军队是四全神兵，所向无敌。
    “东风压倒西风”，自然是指的整个世界上爱好和平争取独立解放的力量，远远超过了帝国主义侵略力量，但在这东风之中，要首先看到人民自己的武装力量。中国人民解放军和苏联军队是亲兄弟，正是这两支并肩而立的强大部队以及社会主义阵营的强大力量，是世界和平阵营的中坚，也是世界和平的最大保障。美英帝国主义出兵中东，气势汹汹，但却又不敢像在朝鲜战场上那样的轻易开枪，就是有畏于这种强大的力量。它们当然明白，要进攻的直接对象，虽然不过是一个为数不过六百万的伊拉克人民，但不能不首先看到“站在保卫世界和平的最前线的”却是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大力量。这正是使帝国主义头痛的最主要的东西。也是我们要尽情歌颂的。
    万岁，东风！万岁，人民的军队！
