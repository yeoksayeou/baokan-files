    Explanation of Page Adjustments
    Recently, the layout of this newspaper has been slightly adjusted. Cultural and educational reports have been moved from page seven to page five, and international reports have been moved from pages five and six to pages six and seven. The content of each page after the adjustment is as follows: page one, important news; page two, agriculture; page three, industry; page four, domestic politics; page five, culture and education; pages six and seven, international; page eight, supplement. In this way, the coverage of domestic issues is more concentrated, which can better promote the technological revolution and cultural revolution. At the same time, considering the suggestions of some readers, international reports are arranged on pages six and seven, which is convenient for readers to read, and also convenient for readers to clip and save materials.

    Everyone Should Report on New Things
    In this era where "one day equals twenty years," many new things are emerging in our country every day and every hour. In the past, this newspaper did not reflect new things adequately enough, and in the future, we plan to greatly strengthen coverage in this area. We hope that the vast number of readers and authors will work together to give strong support to this newspaper. We welcome everyone to submit manuscripts with the following content: 1. New atmosphere and new life in cities and villages; 2. New inventions and creations; 3. New figures in various fields; 4. New experiences in various tasks. The form is not limited and can be written as news reports, communications, letters, essays, special features, etc.

    New Garden for Exchanging Experiences
    According to readers' suggestions, the agricultural page of the People's Daily has opened a new column: "Everyone raises questions, everyone answers them." This reflects the working style of the Party newspaper's mass line and also embodies the policy of running a newspaper by the whole Party and the whole people. In the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, when various regions and departments have problems that cannot be solved, they can get timely answers through this column, providing a garden for exchanging new technologies and new experiences. It is hoped that this column can appear frequently or regularly.

    Inspiring Propaganda Painting
    The propaganda painting "The Peace Policies of China and the Soviet Union Have Won the Sympathy and Support of the People of All Countries," published on the second page of the People's Daily on August 6th, is very inspiring.
    In the propaganda painting, Chairman Mao and Comrade Khrushchev are shaking hands cordially. People of different countries and different costumes around them are watching Mao Zedong and Khrushchev with smiling faces. It can be seen that the people of the world enthusiastically support the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev. This propaganda painting shows the strength of the socialist camp and the love of peace of the people of the world.

    Improve Printing Quality
    After reading the eighth page of the People's Daily on August 3rd, I am not satisfied with your printing work. Except for the advertising column and two poems, there are blank spaces and illegible characters in five articles on this page, totaling more than a dozen places. The newspaper is printed too roughly. Beijing Ren Chengzhi

    Recently, some characters have sometimes appeared unprinted on the newspaper. After inspection, the main reason is that after using the new typesetting machine, the workers have not fully mastered the performance of this machine, and the cast characters are hollow. After the pressure of the pressing machine, they collapse. We sincerely accept the criticism from readers and are taking measures to solve this problem.

    调整版面的说明
    最近本报版面略有调整，即将文教报道由第七版移到第五版，国际报道由第五版、第六版移到第六版、第七版。调整以后的各版内容是：一版，要闻；二版，农业；三版，工业；四版，国内政治；五版，文教；六版、七版，国际；八版，副刊。这样，国内问题的报道比较集中，可以更好地进行技术革命和文化革命的宣传。同时也考虑到有些读者的建议，将国际报道安排在第六、七版，既便于读者阅读，也便于读者剪报保存资料。

    交流经验的新园地
    人民日报农业版根据读者的建议，开辟了“大家出题目，大家来回答”这个新栏目，这反映了党报的群众路线的工作作风，也体现出全党全民办报的方针。在农业生产大跃进中，各地区各部门有了不能解决的问题，通过这个栏目，及时获得答复，为交流新技术和新经验，提供了一个园地。希望这个栏目能够经常出现或定期出现。

    振奋人心的宣传画
    8月6日人民日报第二版刊登了“中苏两国的和平政策得到了各国人民的同情和支持”这幅宣传画，我觉得很能振奋人心。
    宣传画中毛主席和赫鲁晓夫同志正在亲切地握手。四周不同国度、不同服饰的人民满面笑容地注视着毛主席和赫鲁晓夫，可以看出全世界人民都热烈支持毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫的会谈。这张宣传画表现了社会主义阵营的强大和全世界人民对和平的热爱。

    改进印刷质量
    看了8月3日人民日报第八版以后，对你们的印刷工作不够满意。这版除广告栏和两首诗歌以外，五篇文章都有空白和字迹不清的现象，一共有十几处。报纸印得太粗糙了。　北京　任成志
    近来报面上有时出现印不出来的字，经检查，主要原因是使用新的排铸机后，工人同志对这种机器的性能还没有完全掌握好，铸出的字有空心，经过压版机压力后就塌下去了。我们诚恳接受读者的批评，正在采取措施解决这个问题。
