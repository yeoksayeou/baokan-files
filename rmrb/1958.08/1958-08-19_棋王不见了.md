"The Chess King is Missing"

Young worker Li Xiaoxi loved to play Chinese chess the most. As soon as he got off work in the evening, he would squat by the chessboard in the club, and he had never met an opponent, so everyone called him "Chess King."

But these past few days, the club couldn't even find the shadow of the Chess King. His chess friends Hu Amao and Wang Erhu felt very strange. Hu Amao said, "Let's go and catch him and have a hundred rounds of fierce battle!"

Their first step was to go to the dormitory to find him. As soon as they entered the room, they saw that the Chess King's red floral quilt was neatly placed on the bed, but they didn't see the Chess King's shadow.

"Hmph, I don't believe the Chess King just flew away?!" Wang Erhu said gruffly.

The two of them searched east and west, and suddenly saw a red glow soaring into the sky over the playground, and there was a booming sound. When they got closer to look, Wang Erhu exclaimed, "Oh, so the Chess King is here?!"

Hu Amao took a look, and sure enough, there was a large stove standing on a lawn, and seven or eight young men were lifting and carrying, really busy.

"Hey! Idlers get out of the way, it's coming out of the furnace!" They saw the Chess King Li Xiaoxi with his arms bare, one hand waving wildly in the air, beads of sweat the size of soybeans streaming down his face.

As soon as he said that, in the blink of an eye, there was a booming sound, and molten steel, like countless fire snakes, scurried around in the ladle, sparks flying, red light flashing, making the young men clap their hands and laugh happily.

Hu Amao and Wang Erhu had already stared blankly. Li Xiaoxi was the first to see them, "Haha, old comrades-in-arms are here!" Hu Amao was startled and suddenly realized, "Chess... Chess King... You're here..."

Who knew that a young man in a red vest jumped out and said, "Don't call him Chess King anymore, he is the director of our amateur backyard steelmaking plant... I'm still a local expert!" causing the people around to laugh!

### “棋王不见了”

　　“棋王不见了”
    青工李小喜最爱走象棋，晚上一下班就蹲在俱乐部棋台上，并且从来未逢对手，所以大家都把他叫“棋王”。
    可是这几天俱乐部连棋王的影子也找不着，他的棋友胡阿毛和王二虎感到很奇怪，胡阿毛说：“走，咱俩去逮他来大战一百回合！”
    他们第一步先到宿舍里去找，一进屋，只见棋王床上的红花被子放得整整齐齐的，可就是没见棋王的影子。
      “哼，我不信棋王就飞了吗？！”王二虎粗里粗气的讲。
    他俩又东寻西找，忽然见操场那边红光冲天，还有轰轰的响声，他俩走拢一看，王二虎惊叫了起来：“呀，原来棋王在这里呢？！”
    胡阿毛一看，可不是，在一块草坪上立着一个大炉子，七八个小伙子在抬呀，搬呀，真忙得不可开交。
      “喂！闲人让开呀，出炉啦！”只见棋王李小喜赤着双臂，一只手在空中乱舞，黄豆般大的汗珠直从脸上往下淌。
    说时迟、那时快，只听得轰隆一声，钢水像无数条火蛇似的直往包里乱窜，火花四溅，红光闪闪，只乐得小伙子们拍手呵呵的笑。
    胡阿毛和王二虎早已看得发呆了，还是李小喜先瞧见，“哈哈，老战友来了！”胡阿毛一惊才恍然大悟，“棋……棋王……你在这……”。
    那知旁边早跳出个穿红背心的小伙子说：“不准叫棋王啦，他是我们业余土法炼钢厂的厂长……我还是土专家嘞！”引得周围的人们都笑了！
