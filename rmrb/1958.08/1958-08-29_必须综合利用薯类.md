Editorial: We Must Comprehensively Utilize Tubers

This year, China's tuber production has seen significant development, with the planting area increasing by approximately 50% compared to last year, reaching about 240 million mu. Inspired by the Party's General Line, the broad masses of farmers have displayed soaring enthusiasm, and tuber crops are growing particularly well. Initial estimates indicate that total output will increase by about threefold compared to last year. This is a great joyous event for the people of the entire country. However, how can such a large quantity of tubers be consumed and processed in a way that is more beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood? This problem urgently needs to be solved. A good solution can increase the income of farmers and agricultural cooperatives, improve the lives of the broad masses of people, and greatly promote the development of China's agriculture and industry, especially light industry and the chemical industry. A poor solution will dampen enthusiasm for agricultural production, affect industrial development, and cause enormous political and economic losses. This is a complex economic task and a glorious political mission.

Tubers have high nutritional value, and people in most parts of the country have the habit of eating tubers. In many places, tubers are even used as the staple food. When dealing with tuber issues, we should respect the people's habits and meet their needs. Grain and commercial departments should also pay attention to these two points when managing tubers: they must fully meet the needs of people in concentrated tuber production areas, and also ensure that urban residents and those in areas that do not grow or grow few tubers can eat a certain amount of tubers to adjust and improve their lives. However, consumption is always limited. In addition to eating, we must try every means to fully utilize tubers. Some can be used as feed, especially pig feed; most of the rest must be fully utilized in a comprehensive manner.

Comprehensive utilization of tubers has many benefits; it can increase the income of agricultural cooperatives and promote the development of industry and agriculture. Facts in many places have fully demonstrated this. The local distillery in Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province, manufactures ten categories and 150 kinds of products from potatoes, including starch, white wine, vinegar, and soy sauce. The result of this comprehensive utilization not only saves a large amount of industrial grain for the state and accumulates a large amount of wealth, but also increases the income of agricultural cooperatives considerably. This year, after comprehensive utilization of the county's surplus potatoes, each agricultural worker can earn 259 yuan. This figure is more than three times the total annual income of 80 yuan per person last year. Tubers are versatile industrial raw materials that can be used to make wine and starch. After further processing, starch, wine, and starch residue can also be used to manufacture alcohol, synthetic rubber, plastics, dyes, and even explosives. Approximately eight jin of fresh potatoes can produce one jin of starch; 100 jin of starch residue can produce 15 jin of alcohol. This year, China's tuber planting area is 240 million mu. If 100 million mu, with a yield of 5,000 jin of tubers per mu, is used to make starch, more than 31 million tons of starch can be produced; the residue from this starch can be used to extract more than 4.6 million tons of alcohol. Alcohol has a very wide range of uses. In the Soviet Union, alcohol already has more than 150 uses. Alcohol can replace gasoline as a liquid fuel, can be used to manufacture synthetic rubber, and can be used as other chemical industrial raw materials, such as synthetic fibers, plastics, dyes, pesticides, and health medicines. With sufficient alcohol and a large amount of synthetic rubber (not to mention other products), we will have sufficient fuel and tires, which can further promote the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, create conditions for the high-speed development of industry, and promote the early realization of agricultural mechanization.

Are there difficulties in developing the comprehensive utilization of tubers and developing the alcohol industry using tubers as raw materials? There are difficulties. The tuber harvest period is short and concentrated. In addition, tubers are large in volume, high in moisture content, and have thin skin, making them susceptible to disease, difficult to transport, and not easy to preserve. A large number of tubers must be processed in a relatively short period to avoid spoilage and other losses. However, China's existing starch and alcohol industries are far from meeting the needs. This is the difficulty. But as long as we act in accordance with the Party's General Line, firmly rely on the masses, and implement the principle of "using indigenous methods first" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods," these difficulties can be completely overcome.

Chinese farmers have a long history of managing tubers and have accumulated and created many experiences. In terms of fresh tuber storage and preservation, the masses have various methods such as cellar storage, airtight storage, and bag storage; in terms of tuber processing and dehydration, there are dried potato slices, shredded potatoes, processed starch, as well as pressing dehydration methods, grinding pulp into earthen pits for dehydration, and grinding pulp for open-air hanging dehydration. As long as we deeply excavate the experiences of the masses and actively promote them, the problem of tuber storage and initial processing can be basically solved. Properly storing a large number of tubers to avoid spoilage and loss, and promptly processing fresh tubers into dried potatoes, shredded potatoes, potato flour, and starch, is the first step. By doing this, we will create conditions for the comprehensive utilization of tubers. When mobilizing the masses to carry out the initial processing of fresh potatoes, we must oppose the erroneous views that look down on indigenous methods and say that indigenous methods are unscientific and unhygienic. Indigenous methods do have some shortcomings. In the current situation where there is no large amount of modern technical equipment, indigenous methods can still be fully adopted. Moreover, there are many valuable experiences in the "indigenous methods" of the masses. The starch produced by the masses in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, using indigenous methods, does not need to be bleached and already meets the standards of first-class products abroad. Summarizing these experiences and organizing and improving them will lead to methods that are both scientific and hygienic.

While promoting the experiences of the masses and using indigenous methods first, we must also give full play to the capabilities of the country's modern equipment to help the masses in tuber production areas vigorously establish simple tuber processing factories and comprehensive utilization factories. China's existing alcohol factories and thousands of white wine factories are a huge force and should play a leading and backbone role in the development of the comprehensive utilization of tubers. However, the existing equipment processing capacity is very disproportionate compared to the huge number of tubers, and we must vigorously develop local wine-making industries and other industries that use tubers as raw materials. In areas with concentrated tuber production, every township and cooperative should establish its own tuber comprehensive utilization factories and wineries. Only in this way can we fundamentally solve the problem of the comprehensive utilization of tubers. Farmers in most parts of China have experience in making wine from grain and tubers, and many villages also have simple wine-making equipment. As long as we fully mobilize and utilize local industries and provide assistance in key equipment, wineries can be established on a large scale. With wineries, the problem of manufacturing alcohol is not difficult. According to existing experience in various places, ordinary white wine factories can distill 75-proof alcohol without adding any equipment. If simple distillation equipment is added, 95-proof alcohol can be directly manufactured. From this, it seems that wine-making and alcohol production can be done by every township and cooperative. General chemical industries such as synthetic rubber can be run by counties; a few advanced chemical industries can be run by prefectures and provinces. In this way, provinces across the country will form a daily-use chemical industry network with a solid production base, raw material base, and sales market. On the one hand, it can timely purchase tubers and other agricultural and sideline products (such as rice straw, rice bran, etc.) in the region. On the other hand, it can timely supply agriculture and local industries with fuel, raw materials, feed, and other means of production and livelihood, so that agriculture and industry can promote each other and develop together.

The comprehensive utilization of tubers is a new and complex task. It involves agriculture, industry, commerce, grain, and transportation. We must work under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with division of labor and cooperation, to do this work, which has significant economic and political significance, well. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee mobilized and organized all relevant departments and enterprises. Under the unified plan and leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, they divided responsibilities, supported each other, and cooperated closely to solve all the province's tuber comprehensive utilization problems. Shandong and Sichuan provinces are provinces with more tuber crops planted, and they have also relied on their own strength to solve the comprehensive utilization problem of all tubers. We believe that as long as any place strengthens leadership, acts early, and fully mobilizes the masses, it will be able to do this work well and enable tubers to play a greater role in improving people's lives and national economic construction.

Now there are only about two months left before the tuber harvest period. Party committees at all levels and all relevant departments in tuber production areas should seize the time to do all the preparatory work, so that they can immediately start comprehensive utilization after the tuber harvest.

　　必须综合利用薯类
    今年我国薯类生产有了很大的发展，栽种面积比去年增加50％左右，达到二亿四千万亩左右。在党的总路线鼓舞下，广大农民发挥了冲天干劲，薯类作物生长特别好。初步估计总产量将比去年增加三倍左右。这是全国人民一件大喜事。但是，这样大量的薯类如何消费和加工利用才更有利于国计民生呢？这个问题是急待解决的。解决得好，可以增加农民和农业社的收入，改善广大人民的生活；可以大大促进我国农业和工业，尤其是轻工业和化学工业的发展。解决得不好，就会打击农业生产的积极性，影响工业的发展，造成政治上和经济上莫大的损失。这是一件复杂的经济工作，也是一项光荣的政治任务。
    薯类营养价值高，全国大部地区的人民都有吃薯类的习惯，很多地方甚至是以薯类作为主食。在处理薯类问题的时候应该尊重人民的习惯，满足人民的需要。粮食和商业部门进行薯类的经营，也要注意这两点：既要充分满足薯类集中产地的人民需要，也要保证城市居民和不种或少种薯类地区的人都能吃到一定数量的薯类，以调剂和改善人民生活。但是，食用总是有限度的。除了食用以外，还要想尽方法充分利用薯类。有一部分可以用做饲料，特别是猪饲料；还有大部分就要充分地进行综合利用。
    薯类综合利用的好处很多，既能增加农业社的收入，又能促进工农业的发展。很多地方的事实已经充分证明了这一点。山西省五寨县的地方造酒厂，从马铃薯中制造出淀粉、白酒、醋、酱等十类一百五十种产品。这样综合利用的结果，不仅为国家节约了大量的工业用粮，积累了大量的财富，还使农业社增加了大量收入。今年该县的剩余马铃薯进行综合利用以后，每个农业人口能够收入二百五十九元。这个数字比去年全年每人总收入八十元多两倍多。薯类是多种用途的工业原料，能造酒、能制淀粉。淀粉、酒、淀粉渣再经过加工，还能制造酒精、人造橡胶、塑料、染料以及炸药等等。大约每八斤鲜薯，可以出一斤淀粉；一百斤淀粉渣可以出十五斤酒精。今年我国薯类种植面积为二亿四千万亩，如果以其中的一亿亩，亩产五千斤的薯类来造淀粉，可出淀粉三千一百多万吨；这些淀粉的粉渣可以提出酒精四百六十多万吨。酒精的用途非常广泛。在苏联，酒精已经有一百五十多种用途。酒精可以代替汽油作为液体燃料，可以制造人造橡胶，可以作其他化学工业原料，如人造纤维、塑料、染料、农药以及卫生医药等等。有了充足的酒精和大量的人造橡胶（更不要说其他产品了），我们便有了充足的燃料和轮胎，就可以进一步推动工农业的大跃进，为高速度发展工业创造条件，并且促进农业机械化早日实现。
    发展薯类的综合利用事业，发展以薯类为原料的酒精工业有没有困难呢？有困难的。薯类收获期很短，很集中，加上薯类体积大、水分多、皮薄骄气，容易感染病害，运输困难，保存不易。大量的薯类必须在较短的时间内处理完毕，才能避免霉烂等损失。而我国现有的淀粉工业和酒精工业又远远不能满足需要，这就是困难。但是只要我们遵照党的总路线办事，坚决依靠群众，贯彻土法先上马“土洋并举”的方针，这些困难是完全能够克服的。
    我国农民对薯类的经营已有悠久的历史，累积和创造了很多经验。在鲜薯的储藏和保管方面，群众中就有窖藏、密闭、袋贮等多种；在薯类加工去水方面，有干制薯片、薯丝、加工淀粉以及压榨脱水法、磨浆流入土坑脱水法和磨浆空吊脱水法等等。只要我们深入地把群众中的经验发掘出来并积极地加以推广，对于薯类的保管和初步加工问题是能够基本解决的。把大量的薯类妥善保管起来，使它避免霉烂和损失；并及时地把鲜薯加工成薯干、薯丝、薯粉和淀粉，这是第一步，作到了这一步，我们就为薯类的综合利用创造了条件。在发动群众对鲜薯进行初步加工的时候，必须反对那种看不起土法，说土法不科学不卫生等错误观点。土法的确存在着一些缺点。在没有大量现代化技术设备的目前情况下，土法仍然是可以充分采用的。何况群众的“土法”里面有许多宝贵的经验呢？河北省唐山专区群众用土法制出的淀粉，不必经过漂白，已经赶上国外一级品的标准。总结这些经验，把这些经验加以整理提高，就会出现又科学又卫生的方法。
    在推广群众经验，土法先上马的同时，还必须充分发挥国家现代化设备的能力，帮助薯类产区群众，大办简易的薯类加工工厂和综合利用工厂。我国现有的酒精厂和数千个白酒厂是一支巨大的力量，应该在发展薯类的综合利用中起主导和骨干作用。但是现有的设备加工能力同巨大数量的薯类比较起来，是很不相称的，必须大力发展地方的造酒工业和以薯类为原料的其他工业。在薯类集中的产区，乡乡社社都应该建立起自己的薯类综合利用工厂和造酒厂，这样才能根本解决薯类的综合利用问题。我国大部地区的农民都有用粮食和薯类造酒的经验，很多的村庄也有简单的造酒设备。只要把地方工业充分地动员和利用起来，在关键性的设备上给以帮助，造酒厂就能大量建立起来。有了造酒厂，制造酒精的问题也就不难了。据各地已有的经验，普通的白酒厂不增添任何设备，就能蒸馏出七十五度的酒精。如果再增添简易的蒸馏设备，便可直接制造出九十五度的酒精来。这样看来，酿酒和造酒精是乡乡社社都能办的。一般的化学工业如人造橡胶等，也可以由县来办；少数高级的化学工业，则由专区和省来办。这样，全国各省就将形成一个有着巩固的生产基础、原料基地和销售市场的日用化学工业网。一方面它可以适时地收购本地区的薯类及其他农副产品（如稻秸、米糠等），另一方面它又能适时地供应农业和地方工业以燃料、原料、饲料及其他生产和生活资料，使农业和工业互相促进，共同发展。
    薯类的综合利用是一件新的复杂的工作，它关系到农业、工业、商业、粮食和交通运输各个方面。必须在党委的统一领导下，分工协作，才能把这个具有重大经济意义和政治意义的工作做好。山西省委把各个有关部门、企业统统动员和组织起来，在省委的统一计划和领导下，分工负责、互相支援、密切协作，把全省的薯类综合利用问题全部解决了。山东、四川等省是种植薯类作物较多的省份，他们也依靠自己的力量把全部薯类的综合利用问题解决了。我们相信，任何地方只要加强领导，及早动手，充分发动群众，也一定能够把这一工作作好，使薯类在改善人民生活和国家经济建设中发挥更大的作用。
    现在离薯类的收获期只有两个月左右的时间了，薯类产区各级党委和一切有关部门应该抓紧时间，作好一切准备工作，以便在薯类丰收之后立即动手进行综合的利用。
