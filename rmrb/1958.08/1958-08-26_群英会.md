    Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 25th dispatch: Ma Chengji, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xinguang Cooperative in Sancha Township, Wushan County, Gansu Province, Wang Jucai, the cooperative director, and others collectively cultivated a three-mu experimental field of spring rapeseed, with an actual yield of 18,153 jin and 12 liang, averaging 6,051 jin per mu. Additionally, on 13.2 mu of land, the average yield was 5,519 jin and 12 liang per mu. Huang Liangyi, a member of the township Party committee, and others personally participated in the threshing and acceptance.

    Our newspaper reports: The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Yaoping Township, Kangxian County, Gansu Province, achieved an actual yield of 106,378.5 jin of potatoes (potatoes) per mu (excluding 14,000 jin of potatoes interplanted with corn). This cooperative won the Central Agricultural Department's Patriotic Increase Production Gold Star Medal last year. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of the central government, the members are even more motivated. Du Yongxing, the deputy director of the cooperative, Du Shixian, the youth committee member, and other four people are determined to boldly experiment with potatoes yielding 20,000 jin per mu on high mountains at an altitude of 1,500 meters. Due to meticulous work, the yield far exceeded the original plan. On August 22, more than 130 people from the second team dug from dawn to dark to complete the harvest, which weighed a total of 106,378.5 jin of potatoes. Wang Peiyue, deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League County Committee, Sun Qiming, secretary of the Yuntai District Committee, He Xingwen, secretary of the Yaoping Township Party Committee, and more than ten other comrades participated in the acceptance.

    Our newspaper reports: Oats, which were previously considered a low-yield crop, have also achieved high yields. The Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative of Yongdingzhuang in Kouquan District, Datong City, created a new record of 1,002 jin and 7 liang of oats per mu, more than double the 300 jin per mu in 1956, the year with the best harvest in the area.
    This high-yield record was created by Li Qinglin, the captain of the second production team of the cooperative, and Communist Youth League members Song Shuancheng and Sun Bu'san in the experimental field. The reason why so many oats can be produced on one mu of land is mainly due to their careful management from the very beginning. In the autumn of last year, they deep ploughed seven cun once, and in the spring of this year, they ploughed twice again, applying 1,700 jin of base fertilizer (refined fertilizer), 6,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer (refined fertilizer) twice, watering four times, hoeing three times, and also adopted close planting. Therefore, the oats grew tall, thick, with large ears, many seeds, and full grains.

    According to Anhui Daily news: The Shengli team of the Red Star No. 1 Cooperative in Kaishun Township, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, recently harvested 1.5 mu of hemp, totaling 3,024 jin of dry hemp, with an average yield of 2,016 jin per mu.
    This hemp field was an experimental field cultivated by production captain Guan Yingchang and cooperative management committee member Zhu Dingzhang. Wu Hui, secretary of the Kaishun Township Party Committee, Peng Zibin, the township head, Xu Yeming of the township Communist Youth League, and Xiao Zihou, the cooperative director, and others participated in the supervision of the harvest.
    The main measures for achieving high yields in the experimental field are: 1. Selecting seeds with plump grains, sowing 15 days earlier than general hemp, and the sowing amount is 25 jin per mu, with a seedling spacing of 1.5 cun. 2. Thinning seedlings in stages, thinning seedlings every five days when the seedlings are one cun high, for a total of three thinnings. 3. Applying sufficient base fertilizer in layers, and applying topdressing fertilizer rationally in stages, applying a total of four layers of base fertilizer and five topdressings, averaging 3,000 dan of pond mud, 400 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer, 320 jin of cake fertilizer, 120 jin of chemical fertilizer, 220 dan of human manure, and 560 dan of pot wall soil per mu.

    Henan Daily news: 1.5 mu of tomatoes planted by the Xindian Vegetable Cooperative in the suburbs of Jiaozuo City have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, creating a new record of an average yield of 45,660 jin of tomatoes per mu. This record is 1,730 jin higher than the high-yield record of 43,930 jin of tomatoes per mu created by the Hongqi Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing.
    These 1.5 mu of tomatoes are high-yield experimental fields cultivated by the "July 1st" Youth Experimental Farm of the Xindian Cooperative, and all of them are planted with excellent varieties - Soviet Yellow Tomatoes. Seedlings were started in greenhouses before "Minor Cold" last winter, and transplanted to the fields around "Pure Brightness" this spring. A series of high-yield measures were taken during the growing process, and all the members of the farm carried out extremely careful management. The tomatoes were early, numerous, and large (the largest was about three jin), and generally nine fruit trusses were produced.
    As of August 14, six trusses have been harvested from this tomato field, totaling 56,280 jin, and there are still three trusses of abundant tomatoes to be harvested. After specific calculations, it is certain that another 12,210 jin can be harvested.
    Our newspaper reports: Jiangxi Province's Wuyuan green tea, with unique categories and praised as a treasure by Chinese and foreign experts, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year and created the latest record in national tea production. After the "satellite" of 1.54 mu experimental field planted by Cheng Huanquan, director of the Wuyuan Tea Farm, averaging 1,373 jin of dry tea per mu in spring and summer, was just launched, the second "satellite" of 1.35 mu experimental field of Bi Lianggan, the party secretary of Qiukou Township, and Cheng Wanggen, the party branch secretary of Yutan Cooperative, averaging 1,412 jin of dry tea per mu, also went into the sky. In addition, He Yanzhen, the branch secretary of Gu Yuan Township, and Lin Genlan, the director of Gu Yuan Cooperative, have an 0.11 mu experimental field, which yielded 368.3 jin of dry tea, equivalent to a yield of about 3,340 jin per mu; the 0.07 mu experimental field of the Wangkou Community Committee Working Group and the cooperative cadres in Wangkou Township yielded 357 jin of dry tea, equivalent to a yield of about 5,100 jin per mu.
    Wuyuan County not only has many "satellites" of high-yield tea this year, but also has achieved large-scale high yields. In the whole county, there are 47,680 mu with an average yield of 300 jin per mu in the spring and summer tea seasons alone, 234 mu with 300 to 500 jin, 78 mu with 500 to 800 jin, 14 mu with 800 to 1,000 jin, and 3.03 mu with 1,000 to 2,000 jin. The yield of individual high-yield tea gardens has reached more than 4,000 jin per mu. There are 35 cooperatives with 80 to 100 jin, 34 cooperatives with 100 to 200 jin, and 3 cooperatives with more than 200 jin. The Yutan Cooperative, which has a high yield, has an average yield of 803 jin per mu in 8.6 mu of bare vegetable tea garden. Compared with the general yield of more than 20 jin per mu and the highest 40 jin before liberation, it is really dozens or even hundreds of times higher.
    Under the encouragement of the socialist general line, the tea farmers of Wuyuan County, with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, overcame the threat of drought, and through measures such as replanting missing bushes and terrace renovation, transformed nearly 30,000 mu of dilapidated and aging tea gardens into new tea gardens with uniform and healthy bushes. In tea picking, the method of leaving leaves and stalks for multiple picking was generally promoted this year, so that the first shoots were picked first, the later shoots were picked later, and the picking was carried out in batches according to standards; the tea picking methods of "sweeping all" and "leaving top buds" that damage the tea garden and do not distinguish between good and bad were eliminated, which significantly improved the quality of tea, protected the tea trees, and promoted the growth of spring, summer and autumn tea.

    Xinhua News Agency reports: The Five-Star No. 7 Cooperative in Nanshan Township, Daye County, Hubei Province, has created a high record for rice-fish farming. This record was created by Gao Hang and Liu Fengkun, secretaries of the Daye County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Jiang Minghan, the party branch secretary of the Five-Star No. 7 Cooperative, in the three-mu rice-fish farming experimental field. According to the recent acceptance, the average yield of fish per mu in the three-mu rice fields was 1,003 jin, and the early rice was 1,345 jin. After more than three months of growth, the largest of the 3,000 fish fry released grew to three jin, the smallest grew to six liang, and the average grew to more than one jin.
    There are many benefits of promoting rice-fish farming, which is not only of great economic value (according to statistics, there are 300 to 400 million mu of rice fields in the country that can be used for fish farming, and at a yield of 40 jin per mu, 600 to 8 million tons of fish can be produced every year), but also fish can prey on small insects, help to eliminate insects and weeds; the excrement of fish contains phosphorus and potassium, which can fertilize the fields. In addition, due to the movement of the fish, it also promotes the decomposition of fertilizers in the field and increases the fertilizer efficiency. (Attached chart)

    本报讯　甘肃省康县窑坪乡和平农业社一亩洋芋（马铃薯）实收十万六千三百七十八斤半（间种玉米折合洋芋一万四千斤未计入）。这个社在去年曾获得中央农业部爱国增产金星奖章。由于中央的热情鼓舞，社员们的干劲更足。该社副主任杜永兴、青年委员杜世贤等四人决心在海拔一千五百公尺的高山上大胆试验一亩亩产二万斤的洋芋。由于作务细致，产量远远超过了原计划。8月22日第二队一百三十余人从黎明挖到天黑才收完，经过过秤共收洋芋十万零六千三百七十八斤半。参加验收的有共青团县委副书记王配月、云台区委书记孙启明、窑坪乡党委书记何兴文等十余同志。（中共甘肃康县县委会）
    本报讯　过去被认为是低产作物的莜麦，也获得了高产纪录。大同市口泉区永定庄永丰农业社创造了莜麦亩产一千零二斤七两的新纪录，比当地收成最好的1956年亩产三百斤提高二倍多。
    这个高额丰产纪录是这个社第二生产队队长李庆林和共青团员宋拴成、孙补三在试验田里创造的。一亩土地能打出这样多的莜麦，主要是由于他们一开始就进行了细心的经营。去年秋季深耕七寸一次，今春又翻了二次，底肥施了一千七百斤（精肥），两次追肥六千斤（精肥），前后浇水四次，锄过三次，同时还采用了密植。因此，莜麦长的秆高、秆粗、穗大、籽多、颗粒饱满。

    据安徽日报消息　安徽省金寨县开顺乡红星一社胜利队最近收割了一亩五分大麻，共收干麻三千零二十四斤，平均亩产为二千零一十六斤。
    这块麻是生产队长管应昌和社管委朱定掌两人培养的试验田。参加监收监打的有：开顺乡乡党委书记吴徽、乡长彭子彬、乡团委徐叶明和社主任萧子厚等。
    试验田获得丰产的主要措施是：一、选籽粒饱满的种子，播种比一般麻早十五天，播种量每亩为二十五斤，苗距一寸半。二、分期间苗，苗高一寸时，每隔五天间苗一次，共间三次苗。三、分层施足基肥，分期合理追肥，共施四层基肥，五次追肥，平均每亩施塘泥三千担，杂肥四百担，饼肥三百二十斤，化肥一百二十斤，人粪尿二百二十担，锅墙土五百六十担。

    河南日报消息　焦作市郊区新店蔬菜社种植的一亩五分西红柿，获得了空前的大丰收，创造了平均亩产西红柿四万五千六百六十斤的新纪录。这项纪录比北京丰台区红旗社创造的亩产西红柿四万三千九百三十斤的高产纪录，还高一千七百三十斤。
    这一亩五分西红柿是新店社“七一”青年试验场培育的丰产试验田，栽的全是优良品种——苏联黄蕃茄。从去年冬天“小寒”以前就开始在温室里育苗，今春“清明”前后移栽到大田。生长过程中采取了一系列的丰产措施，全场社员进行了极为精细的管理，西红柿结的又早、又多、又大（最大的三斤左右），普遍结了九棚果。
    这块西红柿，截至8月14日，已收了六棚，共五万六千二百八十斤，还有三棚丰硕累累的西红柿未收，经具体查算，有把握还能再收一万二千二百一十斤。
    本报讯　品名类别，独创一格，中外专家誉为珍品的江西省婺源绿茶，今年获得了史无前例的大丰收，并创造了全国茶叶生产的最新纪录。婺源茶场场长程焕全种的一点五四亩试验田，春夏两季平均每亩采干茶一千三百七十三斤的“卫星”刚刚放射出来后，秋口乡党委书记毕联淦和渔潭社党支部书记程旺根同志的一点三五亩试验田，平均每亩采干茶一千四百一十二斤的第二颗“卫星”又上了天。此外，还有古垣乡支部书记何岩贞和古垣社主任林根兰的零点一一亩试验田，采干茶三百六十八斤三两，折合每亩产量约三千三百四十多斤；汪口乡汪口社区委工作组和社干部的试验田零点零七亩，采干茶三百五十七斤，折合每亩产量约五千一百斤。
    婺源县今年不但茶叶高额丰产“卫星”多，而且也获得了大面积丰产。全县仅春夏茶两季平均亩产三百斤的有四万七千六百八十亩，三百到五百斤的二百三十四亩，五百到八百斤的七十八亩，八百到一千斤的十四亩，一千到二千斤的三点零三亩。个别高额丰产茶园折合亩产竟达到四千多斤。八十至一百斤的社有三十五个，一百斤以上二百斤以下的社三十四个，二百斤以上的社三个。高额丰产的渔潭社八点六亩光菜茶园平均亩产高达八百零三斤。这同解放前一般亩产的二十多斤、最高的四十斤来比较，真是高了几十倍，甚至几百倍。
    婺源县的茶农在社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，以冲天的革命干劲，战胜了旱灾威胁，通过补植缺丛、台刈更新等措施，使近三万亩残缺的衰老茶园，改变成为丛齐健壮的新茶园。在采茶中，今年普遍推行了留叶留梗多次采摘法，作到了先发先摘，后发后摘，按标准分批采摘；铲除了“一扫光”、“留顶芽”等损害茶园、好坏不分的采茶方法，显著地提高了茶叶质量，保护了茶树，促进了春夏秋茶的生长。

    据新华社讯　湖北大冶县南山乡五星七社创稻田养鱼高纪录。这个纪录是中共大冶县委书记高航、刘凤昆和五星七社党支书江明汉等在三亩稻鱼兼作试验田里创造的。据最近验收，三亩稻田平均亩产鱼一千零三斤，早稻一千三百四十五斤。投放的三千尾鱼苗，经过三个多月的成长，最大的长到三斤，最小的长到六两，一般平均长到一斤多重。
    推行稻鱼兼作的好处很多，这不仅经济价值很大（据统计，全国有三、四亿亩稻田可以养鱼，以亩产四十斤计算，每年可产鱼六百至八百万吨），而且鱼还可以捕食小虫、帮助除虫、除草；鱼的肥便含有磷、钾，可以肥田。此外，由于鱼的游动，还促使田间肥料分解，增加肥效。（附图表）
