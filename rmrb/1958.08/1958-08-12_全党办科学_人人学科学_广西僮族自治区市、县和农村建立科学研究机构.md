Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 11th – The whole Party runs science, everyone learns science. Scientific research institutions in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are extending to cities, counties, and rural areas. The region now has fifty-one scientific research institutions belonging to the autonomous region level, special districts, cities, and counties. Thirty-five cities and counties have established science popularization associations, and many townships, communes, industrial and mining enterprises, and schools have established science popularization groups.

The science popularization organizations established in various cities, counties, rural areas, and factories widely promote scientific knowledge to the masses. The scientific and technological research and popularization group of the Red Sun Agricultural Cooperative in Yulin County promoted scientific knowledge such as biogas power generation, papermaking, pig breeding, and artificial insemination of pigs, solving many problems in the development of agricultural and sideline production.

The Autonomous Region has established a Science Work Committee to lead the scientific research work in the entire region, and held its first meeting. Based on the socio-economic conditions of the Autonomous Region and the problems that various production departments urgently need to solve in the Great Leap Forward, a preliminary research plan for science, engineering, agriculture, forestry, medicine, and social sciences has been formulated. Various research institutions have begun to investigate, summarize, appraise, and promote the inventions, creations, and advanced production experiences of local people. Many scientific research institutions have also absorbed local advanced producers, labor models, and skilled craftsmen as researchers to carry out research work more extensively.

　　广西僮族自治区市、县和农村建立科学研究机构
    据新华社南宁11日电　全党办科学，人人学科学，广西僮族自治区科学研究机构伸向市、县和农村。全区现有属于自治区一级、专区、市、县的科学研究机构共五十一个，有三十五个市、县已经建立了科学普及协会，不少的乡、社、工矿企业和学校建立了科普小组。
    建立在各市、县和农村、工厂的科学普及机构，广泛地向群众宣传科学知识。玉林县红太阳农业社的科学技术研究普及小组推广了沼气发电、造纸、养猪和猪的人工授精等科学知识，解决了发展农副业生产的不少问题。
    自治区已经成立科学工作委员会，来领导全区的科学研究工作，并召开了第一次会议，根据自治区社会经济情况和各生产部门在大跃进中急需解决的问题，制定了理工、农林、医科和社会科学的初步研究规划。各研究机构都已着手调查、总结、鉴定和推广当地群众的发明创造和先进生产经验。不少的科学研究机构还吸收了当地的先进生产者、劳动模范和能工巧匠作研究员，更广泛地开展研究工作。
