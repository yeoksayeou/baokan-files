    Xushui's Entire Agricultural Cooperatives Transformed into Communes
　　Peasants' Enthusiasm Soars as They Vigorously Strengthen Autumn Field Management
    This Dispatch from Xushui, August 18th (by our reporter Chen Bowei): All agricultural cooperatives in Xushui County, Hebei Province, were transformed into people's communes in the first half of August.
    On August 4th, Chairman Mao's inspection of work in Xushui greatly encouraged the people of Xushui County. That night and the next day, drums and firecrackers resounded everywhere, and the people of the county were immersed in revelry. The peasants said, "Chairman Mao has come, and happiness has followed him." A mass movement to build people's communes swept across the county's urban and rural areas. From that moment on, all 248 agricultural cooperatives in the county announced their transformation into people's communes. On the basis of voluntary participation by the members, the privately owned farm tools, livestock, houses, trees, etc., of each household have been transferred to the ownership of the commune; the portion of the production materials entering the cooperative that was priced has also been decided to be cancelled. Various communes are implementing or preparing to implement a wage system. Public canteens, sewing factories, kindergartens, nurseries, and happiness homes for the elderly, which have developed rapidly in recent months, are now fully popularized and have become components of the newly established people's communes. As household chores have been entirely replaced by collectivized social welfare facilities, more than 69,000 women in the county have been freed from tedious housework and have become a vital force in agricultural production. Many women have learned new technologies such as manufacturing indigenous fertilizers, driving tractors, and making iron.
    In terms of production management, Xushui County changed the method of using small production teams as work units in the previous period, and implemented militarization to ensure a high degree of organization and production efficiency. Now the entire county is further implementing militarization. All labor forces have been compiled into two regiments, one hundred and ninety-one battalions, and six hundred and sixty-six companies. Some townships have issued firearms to young and middle-aged militia members.
    In order to merge the current small communes into large-scale people's communes that combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, Xushui County merged the county's twenty townships into nine large townships on August 15th.
    Xushui County's industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings have developed rapidly since last winter, and the people's communist consciousness has risen unprecedentedly. Under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of peasants in the county, with soaring enthusiasm, built a large number of "grape bunch" and "star-filled sky" reservoir groups, tamed rivers, and drilled more than 2,000 machine wells, basically realizing water conservancy. This year, the people of the county overcame a major drought that had not occurred in decades, achieved a bumper wheat harvest, and completed the sowing task of autumn harvest crops. At present, all crops are growing well, and the peasants of the county are determined to strive for a yield of two thousand catties per mu. After achieving this target, the 310,000 people in the county will have an average of 4,000 catties of grain per person (of which sweet potatoes converted into grain account for a large proportion).
    The people of Xushui County are making great efforts to realize the county's industrialization. On July 20th, the county's first small converter furnace produced its first batch of steel. The county can now produce sixteen kinds of chemical fertilizers on its own. The entire county spent fifteen days fighting to realize the ball-bearingization of all transport tools. The entire county has now established 1,134 factories, including fourteen county-run factories for steel, machinery, cement, rayon, milk powder, biogas, etc. New types of laborers who are "both workers and farmers" are growing rapidly in urban and rural areas throughout the county.
    The high tide of the cultural revolution in Xushui County is coming.
    Not long ago, the county eliminated all illiteracy. A new type of university with more than 800 students—Xushui University—has opened, and townships, cooperatives, farms, and factories have also established 89 part-work, part-study universities. Every township has a middle school, and every village has an elementary school. Many townships and cooperatives have established cultural centers, clubs, libraries, and hospitals.
    The rapid development of production and cultural undertakings in Xushui County has made the people's material and cultural life increasingly rich. Now many communes' kindergartens and nurseries' expenses (including children's food and clothing) are no longer borne by the members themselves. The Dasi Gezhuang cooperative recently bought two dairy cows specifically for the children in the kindergarten to drink milk. The Nanting cooperative bought ten milk goats for the nursery's canteen so that the children could drink goat milk. The elderly in the Happiness Homes are spending their twilight years in peace.
    Seeing that grain production will increase substantially after the autumn harvest, many communes are considering how to solve the problem of "what to do with too much grain." Some communes have now begun to remove quantitative restrictions on the amount of grain consumed by members.
    The people of Xushui County have clearly seen that the life of abundance they have longed for for many years is not a distant prospect, but is being realized step by step.
    At present, the peasants of the entire county are responding to the call of the county party committee to vigorously strengthen the late-stage management of autumn fields. Their slogan is: "Eliminate three types of seedlings in three days, weed the fields clean in one day, and resolutely strive for a bumper harvest of two thousand catties per mu!"

    徐水全部农业社转为公社
　　农民热情高涨正全力加强秋田管理
    本报徐水18日电  记者陈勃伟报道：河北省徐水县所有的农业社已在8月上半月转为人民公社。
    8月4日，毛主席视察徐水工作，大大鼓舞了徐水县人民。在当天夜里和第二天，处处锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，全县人民沉浸在狂欢中。农民们说：“毛主席来了，幸福也跟着他来了。”一个建设人民公社的群众运动的浪潮在全县城乡中掀起。就从那时起，全县二百四十八个农业社宣布转为人民公社。在社员自愿的基础上，各户私有的部分农具、牲畜、房屋、树木等都已转为公社所有；生产资料入社折价款的部分也已决定取消。各个公社正在实行或者准备实行工资制。最近几个月来迅速发展起来的公共食堂、缝纫厂、幼儿园、托儿所和老年的幸福院等，现已完全普及，并已成为新建立的人民公社的组成部分。由于家务劳动已全部为集体化的社会福利设施所代替，全县有六万九千多名妇女摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，成为农业生产上的生力军。许多妇女学会了制造土化肥、开拖拉机和炼铁等新技术。
    在生产管理上，徐水县前一时期就改变了以狭小的生产队为作业单位的方法，实行了军事化，保证了高度的组织性和生产效率。现在全县又进一步实行军事化。全部劳动力已编成二个团、一百九十一个营、六百六十六个连。有的乡已给青壮年民兵发了枪支。
    为了把现在规模很小的公社合并成工农商学兵相结合的大型的人民公社，徐水县于8月15日将全县二十个乡镇并为九个大的乡镇。
    徐水县的工农业生产和文化教育事业自去冬以来有了飞速发展，人民的共产主义觉悟空前高涨，在党的领导下，这个县的广大农民以冲天的干劲兴修了大量的“葡萄串式”和“满天星式”的水库群，驯服了河流，同时又打了两千多眼机井，基本上实现了水利化。今年，全县人民战胜了几十年来所没有的大旱，获得了小麦丰收，完成了秋收作物的播种任务。目前全部农作物生长很好，全县农民决心争取亩产达到两千斤。实现这个指标以后，全县三十一万人口平均每人将有四千斤粮食（其中甘薯折粮占很大比重）。
    徐水县人民为了实现全县工业化，正在做巨大的努力。7月20日，这个县第一座小型转炉炼出了第一炉钢。这个县已能自制十六种化肥。全县大战十五天实现了全部运转工具滚珠轴承化。全县目前已办起一千一百三十四座工厂，其中县办的有钢铁、机械、水泥、人造棉、奶粉、沼气等十四个厂。“亦工亦农”的新型劳动者正在全县城乡中迅速成长。
    徐水县的文化革命高潮正在到来。
    不久以前全县扫除了全部文盲。一座拥有八百多名学生的新型大学——徐水大学已经开学，各乡、社、农场、工厂还办起了八十九座半工半读的大学。乡乡有中学，村村有小学。许多乡和社设立了文化馆、俱乐部、图书馆和医院。
    徐水县生产和文化事业的飞跃发展，使得人民的物质和文化生活日益丰富起来。现在许多公社的幼儿园和托儿所的费用（包括孩子的衣食在内）已经不要社员个人负担。大寺各庄社最近还买了两头奶牛，专供幼儿园的孩子们喝牛奶。南亭社为幼儿食堂买了十只奶羊，让孩子们喝羊奶。幸福院中的老人正在安度他们的晚年。
    眼看秋后粮食就要大量增产，许多公社正在考虑解决“粮食多了怎么办”的问题，有些公社现在就开始取消社员吃粮的定量限制。
    徐水县人民已经清楚地看到，他们多少年来向往的丰衣足食的生活，已经不是什么远景，而正在步步实现。
    目前全县农民正响应县委的号召，全力加强秋田后期管理。他们的口号是：“三天消灭三类苗，一天薅净田里的草，坚决争取亩产双千斤的大丰收！”
