New Forms of Activating the Rural Economy
Sichuan Establishes Small Trading Markets in Agricultural Cooperatives

Chengdu, August 4th (By this newspaper) Sichuan Province's commercial departments have adopted the method of establishing small trading markets in agricultural cooperatives to invigorate the rural economy.

Since this spring, due to the busy agricultural production season, many service stores have extended into the countryside. However, issues such as small purchase volumes, poor skills, and difficult storage have prevented farmers from selling small livestock, poultry, eggs, and other non-staple foods, as well as farmers trading with each other to meet their respective needs.

To fully meet the production and exchange needs of farmers, various localities have implemented the method of extending markets after extending commercial networks. This involves relocating some of the original trading markets from towns to the countryside. According to the needs of farmers, some new, fixed-point, irregular small trading markets are established at appropriate times and locations. Supply and marketing cooperatives and market management departments contact agricultural cooperatives to determine trading locations, times, and the types of goods to be sold. Then, they organize farmers and vendors to trade nearby. Market traders in the market help them negotiate and resolve issues such as prices and weighing, and check the service attitude of vendors.

This type of trading market is basically the same as going to the street (market day). Each time, twenty or thirty trades come from the towns to participate in the transaction. On the stalls, there are cotton cloth, general merchandise, daily necessities, as well as oil, salt, wine and tobacco. The customers are all members of nearby agricultural cooperatives. Members come from all directions with chickens, rabbits, piglets, cats, vegetables and other items to trade. The Wudu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangyou County recently organized three market extensions. Each time, they only traded for a few hours at one location. Many agricultural and sideline products that could not be collected in the past can now be collected.

In the markets that have extended to agricultural cooperatives, industries such as photography, engraving, hairdressing, and repair have also moved from the towns to the countryside one after another. This achieves on-the-spot production and on-the-spot trading; whatever you want to buy is available, and whatever you want to sell or do can be done. If agricultural cooperative members encounter any difficulties in production technology, they can also ask the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative to teach them in time.

### 活跃农村经济的新形式  四川在农业社建立小型交易市场

    活跃农村经济的新形式
    四川在农业社建立小型交易市场
    本报成都4日电　四川省商业部门采取在农业社建立小型交易市场办法，活跃农村经济。
    今春以来，由于农村生产繁忙，许多服务商店虽已下伸到农村，但由于收购量小、技术差、保管困难，农民出售小牲畜、家禽、蛋类等副食品以及农民之间彼此调剂有无仍然得不到解决。
    为了充分满足农民生产交换的要求，各地在商业网下伸之后又推行了市场下伸的办法，就是把原来集镇上部分交易市场，迁到农村里去。根据农民的需要，在适当的时间、地点，新建一些定点不定期的小型交易市场，组织农民就近进行交易。最早采用这种作法的是万县专区，接着，温江、绵阳等专区部分县，也相继采用。他们在距场镇较近的地区、或在几个农业社的中心，由供销社、市场管理部门与农业社联系好交易地点、时间，大致出售的品种等，然后组织农民、商贩前往交易。在市场上，有市场交易员替他们协商解决价格、称斤等问题，检查商贩的服务态度。
    这种交易市场，和上街（赶场）基本上相同。每次从集镇上赶来参加交易的有二、三十个行业。在货摊上，陈列着棉布、百货、日用杂货，还有油盐酒烟。顾主都是附近农业社的社员。社员们从四面八方带着小鸡、小兔、仔猪、猫儿、蔬菜等前来交易。江油县武都区供销社，最近组织了三次市场下伸，每次在一个点上只交易几个钟头，不少过去不能收到的农副产品，现在都能收到。
    在下伸到农业社的市场上，还有照相、刻字、理发、修配等行业，也相继从镇上搬下乡来。做到就地生产、就地买卖；买啥有啥，卖啥做啥了。如果农业社员们遇到一些生产技术上的困难，也可以及时请供销社干部传授。
