    Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Colombo dispatch: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike told reporters that he welcomed the decision to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. He said that the current problem is to find a way to get foreign troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Manila dispatch: "Manila Chronicle" reported on August 9th that Philippine President Garcia said at a press conference yesterday that the Philippines would support any proposal calling for the withdrawal of US and British troops from the troubled Middle East at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting.

    According to Garcia's explanation, the Philippines is taking this position based on the belief that the United Nations, as an international organization, will be able to maintain peace and guarantee the independence of the countries in the region.

    "Manila Chronicle" published an editorial welcoming this stance, believing that the Philippines' attitude on the Middle East issue this time is different from its usual stance at United Nations meetings.

    "Manila Chronicle" hopes that the Philippine delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly meeting will, with a sense of pride and integrity, realize the position of demanding the withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East.

    锡总理欢迎开联大紧急会议  菲总统支持要美英撤军建议
    新华社9日讯  科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克对新闻记者说，他欢迎召开联合国大会紧急会议的决定。他说，当前的问题就是设法要外国军队及早从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。
    新华社9日讯　马尼拉消息：“马尼拉纪事报”在8月9日报道，菲律宾总统加西亚昨天在一次记者招待会上说，在即将召开的联合国大会的会议上，菲律宾将支持任何要求美英军队撤出多事的中东的建议。
    根据加西亚的说明，菲律宾采取这种立场是根据联合国这个国际组织将会有能力来维护和平和保障那个地区的国家的独立。
    “马尼拉纪事报”发表一篇社论表示欢迎这种立场，这家报纸认为，菲律宾这次在中东问题上所采取的态度同它通常在联合国的会议上所采取的立场有所不同。
    “马尼拉纪事报”希望出席联合国大会会议的菲律宾代表团能够抱着骄傲的心情和正直的态度来实现要求美英军队撤出中东的立场。
