Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 31st: The Songhua River embankment project in Harbin has been completed one year and five months ahead of schedule.

This 37.8-kilometer-long embankment along the river has now become a solid levee built with boulders and cement. The height of the levee is more than two meters higher than the 120.30-meter high water level of last year's extraordinary flood. The levee body is as thick as a small mountain, and the top of the levee has been built into a broad avenue of up to ten meters wide.

This embankment stands like a copper wall and iron bastion on both banks of the Songhua River in the urban area of ​​Harbin. Even if the Songhua River basin experiences the largest flood in history like last year, it will not threaten the safety of Harbin.

On July 29th, 40,000 soldiers and civilians in Harbin gathered to celebrate the early completion of this permanent river embankment and awarded more than 2,000 embankment construction models.

Harbin is located in the middle reaches of the Songhua River. In the past, whenever the flood season came, the river level would exceed the flat land within the embankment. Every time a flood came, the people of the city had to rush to repair the dikes. Such a sudden flood prevention had a considerable impact on the production, work, and study of factories, institutions, schools, and enterprises throughout the city. Therefore, the state specially allocated more than 30 million yuan to Harbin last winter and transferred a division of the People's Liberation Army to assist the people of the city in building this permanent embankment.

    松花江大堤提前竣工
    据新华社哈尔滨31日电　哈尔滨市松花江大堤工程已提前一年零五个月完工。
    这条三十七点八公里长的沿江大堤，现在已成为用块石、水泥砌起来的坚固的堤防。堤的高度比去年特大洪水水位一二○·三○公尺高出二公尺多，堤身像一堵小山那样厚，堤顶筑成了宽达十公尺的康庄大道。
    这条大堤像铜墙铁壁似的屹立在哈尔滨市区的松花江两岸，即使松花江流域出现像去年那样历史上最大的洪水，也不会威胁到哈尔滨的安全了。
    哈尔滨市四万军民在7月29日集会庆祝这个永久性江堤的提前竣工，并且奖励了两千多个筑堤模范。
    哈尔滨在松花江中游，过去每当汛期来临，江面水位都超过堤内平地。每次洪水到来，全市人民都要突击抢修堤防。这样突击防洪，使全市工厂、机关、学校、企业的生产、工作和学习受到不少影响，因此国家在去冬特地拨给哈尔滨市三千多万元，抽调人民解放军一个师来协助全市人民修筑这条永久性大堤。
