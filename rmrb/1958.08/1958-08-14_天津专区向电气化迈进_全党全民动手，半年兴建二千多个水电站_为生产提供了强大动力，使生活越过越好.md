    Tianjin Special Zone Marches Towards Electrification
　　The Entire Party and All People Mobilize to Build Over 2,000 Hydropower Stations in Half a Year
    Providing Powerful Momentum for Production and Making Life Better and Better
    (Our Dispatch) This reporter, Deng Zichang, reports: The Tianjin Special Zone of Hebei Province has raised high the banner of rural electrification. To date, the masses throughout the zone have utilized water power, wind power, and biogas to build 829 large and small power stations, realizing rural electrification rapidly, effectively, and economically.
    Since the success of the depression area transformation in Tianjin Special Zone, the amount of agricultural labor has greatly increased. In particular, after a large amount of dry land was converted to paddy fields, calculating only the newly opened 3.5 million mu of paddy fields, 24 million more labor days are needed than in previous years when dry land was cultivated. This is equivalent to the workload of all able-bodied men and women in the zone for forty days. Rice also requires stricter planting schedules. During busy seasons, even if all sideline production is stopped and all manpower is put into tackling agricultural work, labor is still insufficient. To solve the problem of labor shortages, farmers urgently demanded mechanization and semi-mechanization. However, the use of machinery relies on power. Although livestock are also a source of power, it is inconceivable to use them to pull large machines and water pumps, which requires electricity to drive them. In addition, with the implementation of the policy of combining industry and agriculture this year, more than 40,000 small factories have been established throughout the zone. The machines in the factories cannot be pulled by cattle, and there is an urgent need to solve the power problem.
    The Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to take advantage of the fact that the entire zone has formed an irrigation and drainage system after the transformation of the depression area—there is water everywhere, and there are differences in elevation everywhere—to call on the entire Party and all the people to use their wisdom and strength to launch a movement to develop small power stations, mainly hydropower.
    In early spring of this year, the Prefectural Committee assigned responsible cadres to lead technical personnel who had not designed power stations before, along with blacksmiths, carpenters, and masons, to boldly try to build a power station in Beiwulizhuang, Jinghai County. As a result, the first hydropower station was built on a canal using a water flow with a drop of only 1.2 meters. To explore whether stations could be built with even lower drops, they reduced the drop to one meter, nine decimeters, eight decimeters, and even seven decimeters, and they all generated electricity. The secret of the drop was revealed by the masses. The first batch of ten small hydropower stations appeared in a short period of time. With electricity, farmers not only used electric lights for the first time, but more importantly, they used electricity and water energy to drive small steel mills, straw cutters, etc., realizing people's desire to be liberated from heavy physical labor.
    The good news of the completion of the first batch of power stations spread throughout the zone, greatly encouraging people's enthusiasm to build power stations with their own hands. Not only blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, and ordinary commune members were enthusiastic about building power stations, but also women, children, and the elderly joined the upsurge of building power stations. Women in Shangwu Township, Qing County, voluntarily took out their income from sideline production such as making soles for shoes, and built an 18-horsepower "March 8th Hydropower Station" in seventeen days. The children of Anci County sold the scrap iron, toothpaste tubes, and waste paper they picked up, and saved money from buying clothes to invest 3,000 yuan to build a "Young Pioneers Hydropower Station." One new power station after another was built, some on gates, pumping stations, siphons, and other places with larger drops, and some on rivers and canals. These power stations had no complete data or formal drawings and designs beforehand, but the commune members did it themselves, researching and building at the same time, and learned the skills of management and use.
    The masses conscientiously implemented the principles of making use of local resources, adapting to local conditions, and building stations diligently and thriftily. In addition to purchasing machines such as generators and motors, the main part of the power station—the turbine chamber—was entirely made of wood, bricks, and stones instead of concrete structures, and the water turbines were also made of wood. When generators could not be bought, electric motors were modified to replace them, so the cost was not high. The Tuanbowa Hydropower Station, built by the state, invested 600,000 yuan and generated 390 kilowatts, with a cost of more than 1,500 yuan per kilowatt; while the Baojiaying Hydropower Station, built by the masses in Wuqing County, invested 11,000 yuan and generated 75 kilowatts, with a cost of only more than 140 yuan per kilowatt. The newly built 10-horsepower hydropower station in Sanpu Village, Mozhou Township, Renqiu County, invested 1,400 yuan (excluding the generator) and can drive a stone mill to produce 8,000 jin of flour per day. Calculating the processing fee at one cent per jin, the income can be 2,400 yuan per month. The local masses excitedly talked about: The capital will be recovered in one month after the power station is built and put into production.
    On the basis of gaining experience in building small hydropower stations, Tianjin Special Zone also advocated and supported the masses in developing wind power, biogas, and small power machinery for power generation. To date, the entire zone has built 106 hydropower stations, 128 wind power stations, 534 biogas power stations, and 61 large power stations, totaling 829 completed stations. There are also 1,339 stations under construction. According to statistics from the first 40 or so hydropower stations built, there are more than 830 horsepower in total. If used to drive water pumps, calculated at ten hours a day, it can free up more than 2,600 laborers who are rocking waterwheels, and irrigate more than 17,000 mu of paddy fields. If used to drive small steel mills, it can produce more than 330,000 jin of flour in eight hours a day, allowing more than 3,300 women with more than 3,300 livestock to come out of the mill and participate in agricultural production. If used for power generation and lighting, it can provide electricity to more than 40,000 farm households. Now the people of Tianjin Special Zone are even more energetic and determined to raise the banner of rural electrification even higher, providing more power for industrial and agricultural production, making production higher and higher, and life better and better.

    天津专区向电气化迈进
　　全党全民动手，半年兴建二千多个水电站
    为生产提供了强大动力，使生活越过越好
    本报讯　记者邓子常报道：河北省天津专区高举起农村电气化的旗帜。到目前为止，全专区群众已利用水力、风力、沼气建成大、小型发电站八百二十九座，正多快好省地实现农村电气化。
    天津专区自从洼地改造成功后，农活用工大大增加，特别是大量旱田改为水田以后，仅按新开稻田三百五十万亩一项计算，就要比往年种旱田用工多二千四百万个劳动日，等于全区男女整半劳力四十天的工作量。水稻在种植时间上要求也比较严格，繁忙季节就是停止一切副业生产，全部人力投入突击农活，劳力还不够用。为了解决劳力不足的问题，农民们迫切要求实行机械化、半机械化。然而使用机械要靠动力，牲口虽也是动力，但不能设想用牲口去拉大机械和水泵，这就需要用电力带动。此外，今年贯彻工农业并举的方针，全区建立了四万多个小工厂，工厂的机器不能用牛拉，也急需解决动力问题。
    中共天津地委决定利用洼地改造以后全区已组成一个排灌系统——到处有水，到处有落差的条件，号召全党动手，全民动手，用群众智慧和力量，开展一个以水力为主的发展小型电站运动。
    今年初春，地委指派负责干部，带领没有作过电站设计的技术人员和铁、木、瓦匠一起，首先在静海县北五里庄进行兴建电站的大胆尝试。结果在一条渠道上，利用落差只有一点二公尺的流水修成了第一座水电站。为了探索在更低的落差下是否能建站，他们把落差降低到一公尺、九公寸、八公寸以至七公寸，也都发了电。落差的秘密被群众揭开了。短期内就出现了第一批十座小型水电站。有了电，农民们不仅第一次用上了电灯，更重要的是利用电力和水能来带动小钢磨、铡草机等，实现了人们从沉重的体力劳动中解放出来的愿望。
    第一批电站建成的喜讯传遍了全区。大大鼓舞了人们用自己双手修电站的积极性。不但铁、木、瓦匠和一般社员热心搞电站，就是妇女、儿童和老人也投入建电站的热潮中。青县上伍乡的妇女，自动拿出她们纳鞋底等副业生产收入，十七天建成了一座十八马力的“三八水电站”。安次县的少年儿童们，把拣来的碎铁、牙膏皮、破纸等卖掉，又节省买衣物的钱投资三千元，建成了一座“红领巾水电站”。一个接一个的新电站，有的建在闸门、抽水机站、虹吸管等落差较大的地方，有的建在河流、渠道上。这些电站事先都没有成套的资料，也没有正规的图纸和设计，而是社员们自己动手，边研究，边建设，并且学会了管理和使用的本领。
    群众认真执行了因陋就简，就地取材，勤俭建站的原则。除了要购买发电机、电动机等机器外，电站的主要部分——涡轮室，完全是用木料、砖、石代替水泥结构，而水轮机也是用木料作成的。买不到发电机就用电动机改装来代替，因此，花钱也不多。由国家兴修的团泊洼水电站，投资六十万元，发电三百九十瓩，折合每瓩成本一千五百多元；而武清县宝稼营群众自办的水电站，投资一万一千元，发电七十五瓩，折合每瓩成本才一百四十多元。任丘县鄚州乡三铺村新建成的一座十马力的水电站，投资一千四百元（不包括发电机），能带动石磨一天出面粉八千斤，以每斤加工费一分钱计算，一个月就可收入二千四百元。当地群众兴奋地谈论着：电站建成投入生产一个月，老本就都回来了。
    天津专区在取得了建设小型水电站经验的基础上，还提倡和支持群众搞风力、沼气以及小型动力机械发电。到目前为止，全专区已建成水电站一百零六座，风力发电一百二十八座，沼气发电五百三十四座，大电站六十一座，共计完成八百二十九座。正在兴建中的还有一千三百三十九座。仅据最早建成的四十多座水电站统计，共有八百三十多马力。如果用来带动水泵，按一天十小时计算，就可以腾出摇水车的二千六百多个劳动力，灌溉稻田一万七千多亩，如果使之带动小钢磨，一天八小时能出面粉三十三万多斤，让三千三百多个妇女带着三千三百多头牲口从磨房里出来参加农业生产；如果用来发电照明，能使四万多个农家有电灯。现在天津专区人民的干劲更足，决心更高地举起农村电气化的旗帜，为工农业生产提供更多的动力，使生产越来越高，生活越来越好。
