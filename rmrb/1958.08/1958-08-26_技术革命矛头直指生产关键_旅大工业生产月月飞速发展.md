Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, August 25th. Lüda City has consistently performed well in completing its industrial production plans this year. According to statistics from January to July, the city's total industrial output value has completed 60.7% of the annual state plan, an increase of 34.4% compared to the same period last year. During the same period, Lüda City successfully trial-produced several hundred new products, most of which are high-end and precision products.

　　This year, the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has been paying close attention to industrial production, providing specific leadership. In particular, after the city-wide launch of the vigorous industrial "drought resistance" campaign, the vast number of employees' technical revolution pointed towards the key and difficult points in production, causing the speed of production development to increase sharply month by month. In the first quarter of this year, the city's total output value increased by 16.8% compared to the same period last year; although industrial production faced more difficulties in April, it leaped forward faster and faster; in May, the total industrial output value increased by 33% compared to the same period last year; in June, it increased by 49%; and in July, it increased by 58%.

　　The machinery industry, a major component of Lüda's industry, has experienced an unusually severe shortage of raw material supplies this year. There is a large gap between the amount of metal materials allocated by the state and the needs of various factories. However, the city's machinery industry employees relied on their own efforts to overcome the difficulties. For example, in the first half of the year, the steel needed by the machinery industry was nearly a quarter short, so various factories adopted a series of measures such as excavating old steel, reducing machining allowances, reducing machine weight, and finding substitutes to solve the problem.

　　In the face of a tight power supply situation, Lüda City launched a city-wide electricity conservation campaign, which strongly supported industrial production. The city saved more than 27 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first half of the year.

　　Labor and equipment shortages are also two prominent problems for Lüda's industry this year. Lüda City adopted five measures of "reduction, excavation, substitution, installation, and addition" to solve the labor problem. These are: reducing the dispensable labor force in some units to replenish urgently needed units; extracting labor through improved labor organization and other methods; replacing men with women to engage in lighter physical labor; arranging labor in a unified manner in various units to squeeze out labor; and adding a small portion of necessary production workers.

　　In the face of equipment shortages, many enterprises have broken with conservative ideas and manufactured their own equipment to equip themselves. Some factories with small scale and small processing equipment also adopted the "ants gnawing at bones" method to make their own equipment.

### 技术革命矛头直指生产关键  旅大工业生产月月飞速发展

　　技术革命矛头直指生产关键
    旅大工业生产月月飞速发展
    新华社旅大25日电　旅大市今年以来完成工业生产计划情况一直良好。据1到7月份的统计，全市工业总产值已经完成了全年国家计划的60.7％，比去年同期增长了34.4％。在同时期内，旅大市试制成功了好几百种新产品，而且大部分是高级和精密的产品。
    中共旅大市委今年对工业生产抓得很紧，领导得具体。特别是全市范围内开展轰轰烈烈的工业“抗旱”运动以后，广大职工的技术革命矛头被引向生产中的关键和困难，使生产发展速度逐月急递上升。今年第一季度，全市生产总值比去年同期增长16.8％；4月份工业生产虽然面临更多的困难，却跃进得越来越快；5月份工业总产值比去年同期增长33％；6月份增长49％；7月份增长58％。
    旅大工业主要的组成部分机械工业，今年原材料供应异常不足，国家拨给的金属材料的数量和各厂的需要量之间有很大距离。但是全市机械工业职工自力更生，克服了困难。如上半年，机械工业需要的钢材缺少将近四分之一，各厂就采取挖掘旧钢材、减少加工余量、降低机器体重和寻找代用品等一系列办法解决了。
    在电力供应紧张的局面下，旅大市开展了全民性的节电运动，有力地支援了工业生产。全市上半年共节约了两千七百多万度电。
    劳动力和设备缺乏，也是旅大工业今年两个突出的难题。旅大市采取了“减、挖、代、安、添”的五项措施，解决了劳动力问题。这就是：减少一些单位可有可无的劳动力，充实急需的单位；用改进劳动组织等办法，抽出劳动力；以女代男，从事较轻的体力劳动；各单位统一安排，挤出劳动力；增添一小部分必要的生产工人。
    在设备缺乏的情况下，许多企业都打破了保守思想，自己动手制造设备，装备自己。规模不大、加工设备较小的一些工厂，也采取了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，自制设备。
