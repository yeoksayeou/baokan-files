　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 21st: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session continued its discussion on the situation in the Near and Middle East caused by the intervention of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan at the morning meeting on the 20th.

　　The head of the Ceylon delegation, Corea, said that the presence of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan is a potential threat to peace, and this action is "turning the Near East into a tinderbox." No article of the United Nations Charter can justify US and British intervention in the Near East. He emphasized that the General Assembly should focus on the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Because the proposal of Norway and other countries did not include the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, this proposal is unacceptable to many countries.

　　The Ceylon representative advocated that representatives of major powers, Arab countries, and other relevant countries discuss political and economic issues related to the Middle East region at a summit meeting. He suggested that the United Nations Secretary-General consult with representatives of major powers and other relevant countries on this issue.

　　The representative of Yemen, Permanent Observer of the Arab League to the United Nations, Rahim, emphasized that Arab nationalism is a people's movement. No force can suppress this movement. He said that the foreign troops' occupation of Arab Eastern countries (such as Algeria, South Arabia, Lebanon, or Jordan) aroused deep indignation among all the people of Arab countries.

　　Rahim pointed out that the reasons given by some delegations to justify the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan are hypocritical. He said, we firmly believe that as long as the foreign troops occupying Arab lands do not withdraw, any method of solving our current serious problems will inevitably fail.

　　Speaking of the suggestion of establishing a United Nations force, the Yemeni representative pointed out that if the United Nations takes such action under the pretext of fighting "indirect aggression," then it will become a tool to perpetuate tyranny.

　　The Yemeni representative criticized the seven countries for not demanding the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, which made the proposal fundamentally unacceptable.

　　Finally, the Yemeni representative put forward three key points that he believes can provide the necessary prerequisites for a realistic and prudent solution to the Near and Middle East issue: First, foreign troops should immediately withdraw from Arab lands; second, understand the nature of the magnificent national movement throughout the Arab world; third, Arab countries hope not to participate in any treaties or doctrines.

　　The Ethiopian representative, Prince Alimayehou, generally opposed foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries in his speech, but he defended the US and British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan.

　　French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville supported the US and British aggression against the Near East. He opposed the demand by many delegations for the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and advocated leaving the issue of the withdrawal of the occupying forces from Lebanon and Jordan to the aggressors themselves to study. The French representative supported the seven-nation proposal that did not mention the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. At the same time, he advocated holding a summit meeting with the participation of heads of government of major powers and other relevant countries to study the situation in the Near East.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 21st: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session continued its meeting in the afternoon and evening of the 20th. The general discussion of the meeting on the Near East situation is about to end and turn to the discussion of various proposals.

　　The Foreign Minister of Byelorussia, Kiselev, pointed out that the "seven-nation" proposal is just a cover to shield US and British interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

　　Kiselev said that the new US plan announced by the United States on the United Nations General Assembly podium is to replace the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" which has been unanimously rejected by the Arab people.

　　Kiselev also pointed out that it can be seen from the speech of British Foreign Secretary Lloyd that Britain also does not want to resolve the extremely serious crisis caused by the US and British intervention in the Near and Middle East.

　　The Malayan representative, Rahman, advocated taking measures on the rapid withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. He emphasized that the continued presence of these troops there would only deepen the crisis in the Near and Middle East. Rahman also advocated expanding the activities of the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon and extending their activities to Jordan.

　　The representative of Liberia, Dukuly, one of the "drafting countries" of the "seven-nation" proposal, also had to admit in his speech that the deployment of troops to the Middle East was a reason for everyone to feel uneasy. However, Dukuly went on to ask the United Nations General Assembly to support the "seven-nation" proposal, which evaded the issue of the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

　　The representatives of Venezuela and Brazil also expressed their support for the "seven-nation" proposal.

　　Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a speech at the afternoon meeting and made a preliminary summary of the discussions at the General Assembly. He pointed out that the discussions in the past two weeks have shown that the majority of the United Nations member states condemn the aggression committed by US and British troops in the Near East, because this has created tension in the region. They all advocate the rapid withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

　　Gromyko said that except for the representatives of the United States and Britain and the representatives of some other countries whose hands and feet were bound by military and other obligations to these two countries, no one defended the foreign military intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. He pointed out that even the representatives of the countries directly responsible for this act of aggression had to make assurances to appease the public, even though these assurances did not obligate them to anything.

　　Gromyko mentioned that some people at the United Nations General Assembly believed that the United States and Britain respect the United Nations Charter and follow the Charter in practical actions, emphasizing that Eisenhower's statement that the United States "reserves the right to send its troops to other small countries" cannot prove that the United States respects the United Nations Charter.

　　Gromyko pointed out that in the past two or three years, the aggressive policies of the West have more than once brought the world to the brink of explosion. He emphasized that the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by and watch the Near and Middle East region become an increasingly dangerous breeding ground for conspiracies and provocations, and a source of war.

　　Gromyko demanded that Britain stop its interference in Jordan and the United States stop its interference in Lebanon, and demanded that the two countries withdraw their troops from the Middle East.

　　Gromyko reminded the General Assembly to pay attention to the remarks that "indirect aggression" is the cause of the Middle East crisis. He pointed out that the report of the United Nations Observer Group confirmed that the internal affairs of Lebanon had not been subjected to any external interference from neighboring countries.

　　Gromyko continued, if it is true that someone has participated in "indirect aggression" and made "indirect aggression" an integral part of international relations, then it is the United States and Britain. Just counting the many conspiracies planned from the outside to overthrow the legitimate governments of the Arab Eastern countries, and counting the people sent to that region, it can completely overthrow the absurd claim that the US and British troops went to the Near East to protect Lebanon and Jordan from some "indirect aggression" from abroad.

　　Gromyko also exposed the implication of the US and British delegations that the threat of Israeli aggression against Jordan prevented the British from quickly withdrawing their troops from Jordan. He said that this situation can only be said to be a pre-planned trick. If Israel does not receive the support of other countries, there will be no danger of Israeli aggression against Jordan.

　　Gromyko also drew everyone's attention to the attempt by certain Western countries, especially the United States, to divert the debate from the main task of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session convened at the initiative of the Soviet Union, which is to end the current tension in the Near and Middle East caused by the entry of US and British troops into the territory of the two Arab countries, and demand the withdrawal of these troops, by proposing various economic programs.

　　Gromyko said that this does not mean that the Soviet Union does not fully value the issue of providing economic assistance to the Near and Middle East countries and promoting their development. On the contrary, the Soviet Union warmly advocates assisting the young Eastern countries to develop their economies and consolidate their independence, and this assistance is not attached to any political or other conditions.

　　Gromyko pointed out that the majority of the United Nations member states sincerely hope to find a solution that can ease international tensions and consolidate peace. The vast majority of countries participating in the General Assembly expressed their hope to jointly find such a solution with the delegations of various countries, including the Soviet delegation. However, the US and British delegations do not have this desire. In order to oppose the Soviet proposal for the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan and the adoption of corresponding measures by the United Nations, a proposal bearing the signboard of Norway but essentially the stuff of the United States and Britain was put forward at the General Assembly. The main purpose of this proposal is to confuse the participants of the General Assembly and create the illusion that the United States and Britain also hope to withdraw their troops. This proposal essentially suggests not expressing any opinion on the central issue discussed by the emergency meeting at all, and trusting everything to the goodwill and pleasant promises of the US and British governments. Gromyko said, what value is there in passing this proposal, which is tantamount to endorsing a proposal that violates the will and legitimate interests of the directly concerned Arab countries?

　　Gromyko said that the most correct and best way to ease the tension in the Near and Middle East is for US and British troops to immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. Adopting this path will not only enhance the prestige of the United Nations, but also benefit the prestige of the United States and Britain. The Soviet proposal is consistent with this task.

　　At the beginning of the evening meeting, some representatives who promised to support the US "seven-nation" proposal continued to defend this proposal. But the fate of this proposal has been decided. Because despite various efforts by the United States, it has not obtained the guarantee of the necessary two-thirds majority of votes in the General Assembly to pass this proposal. All the representatives of the Arab countries, except for occupied Lebanon and Jordan, unanimously opposed this proposal.

　　It is clear to everyone that continuing to attempt to force through a proposal on the Near and Middle East that is opposed by the countries in the region is meaningless. Ghanaian representative Chapman expressed this sentiment, although he did not express opposition to the "seven-nation" proposal. He said: Any method of solving the Near and Middle East issue is unrealistic if it does not have the support of the majority of countries in the region. We cannot force the people of some countries to accept any decision in the United Nations that violates the will of these people.

　　During the meeting, it was learned that the delegations of the Arab countries were preparing to put forward a compromise proposal. After the initiators of the "seven-nation" proposal affirmed that the attempt to force through the "seven-nation" proposal would not succeed, they told reporters that the proposal of the Arab countries was generally acceptable to them. This proposal has been drafted, but it has not been formally put forward by the Arab countries.

　　At the evening meeting, professional slanderers, Cuban representative Núñez-Portuondo and Israeli representative Eban, defended the US armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

　　The last speaker at the evening meeting was Mexican representative Colina, who expressed his hope that the proposal of the Arab countries would be accepted by the participants of the General Assembly. After Colina's speech, the evening meeting was adjourned.

　　葛罗米柯在联大紧急会议上指出
    只有美英撤军才能缓和中东局势
    美制七国提案滞销  阿拉伯国家将提出折衷提案
    据新华社21日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会紧急特别会议20日上午会议继续讨论由于美英军队干涉黎巴嫩和约旦所造成的中近东局势。
    锡兰代表团团长科里亚说，美英军队驻在黎巴嫩和约旦是对和平的潜在威胁，这个行动“正在把近东变成一个一触即发的火药桶”。联合国宪章的任何一条都不能证明美英干涉近东是正当的。他强调，大会应当把注意力集中在美英自黎巴嫩和约旦撤军的问题上。由于挪威等国的提案没有包括美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦这一点，因而这个提案是许多国家所不能接受的。
    锡兰代表主张在最高级会议上由大国代表、阿拉伯国家和其他有关国家的代表来讨论有关中东地区的政治和经济问题。他建议联合国秘书长就这个问题同大国和其他有关国家代表进行磋商。
    也门代表、阿拉伯联盟驻联合国常任观察员拉希姆强调说，阿拉伯民族主义是一种人民运动。任何力量都镇压不了这种运动。他说，外国军队侵占阿拉伯东方国家（如阿尔及利亚、南阿拉伯、黎巴嫩或约旦）激起阿拉伯各国全体人民深深的愤慨。
    拉希姆指出，某些代表团企图为美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦辩解的理由是虚伪的。他说，我们坚信，只要占领着阿拉伯土地的外国军队不撤离，任何解决我们当前的严重问题的方法都必然要失败。
    谈到建立联合国部队的建议时，也门代表指出，如果联合国借口同“间接侵略”作斗争而采取这种行动的话，那末它就会变成一种使暴政长期固定下来的工具。
    也门代表批评七国没有要求立刻撤退外国军队，这就使提案根本不能接受。
    也门代表最后提出他认为可以为实事求是地、稳妥地解决中近东问题提供必要的前提的三个要点：第一、外国军队立刻撤出阿拉伯土地；第二、了解整个阿拉伯世界上波澜壮阔的民族运动的性质；第三、阿拉伯国家希望不参加任何条约和主义。
    埃塞俄比亚代表阿利马伊侯在发言中总的反对外国干涉其他国家的内政，可是他又替美英干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的行为辩解。
    法国外交部长德姆维尔支持美英对近东的侵略。他反对许多代表团提出的美英军队立刻撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的要求，而主张把占领军撤离黎巴嫩和约旦的问题留待侵略者自己去研究。法国代表支持只字不提美英从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军问题的七国提案。同时他主张举行有大国以及其他有关国家政府首脑参加的高级会议来研究近东的情况。
    据新华社21日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会紧急特别会议20日下午和晚间继续开会。会议关于近东局势的一般性讨论即将结束而转入各个提案的讨论。
    白俄罗斯外交部长基谢廖夫指出，“七国”提案不过是一个用来为美英干涉阿拉伯国家的内政打掩护的幌子。
    基谢廖夫说，美国在联合国大会讲坛上宣布的美国的新计划是用来代替已经遭到阿拉伯人民一致摒弃的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的。
    基谢廖夫还指出，从英国外交大臣劳埃德的发言中可以看出，英国也不想解决由于美英干涉在中近东所造成的极端严重的危机。
    马来亚代表拉赫曼主张就美英军队迅速撤离黎巴嫩和约旦的问题采取措施，他强调指出，这些军队留驻在那里只会加深中近东的危机。拉赫曼还主张扩大在黎巴嫩的联合国观察团的活动，把它们的活动扩大到约旦去。
    作为“七国”提案“草拟国”之一的利比里亚代表杜库利在发言中也不得不承认，把军队调往中东是使大家感到不安的一个原因。可是，杜库利接着又要求联合国大会支持那个回避美英军队立刻撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的“七国”提案。
    委内瑞拉和巴西的代表们也表示支持“七国”提案。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在下午的会议上发了言，对大会的讨论作了初步的总结。他指出，近两周来的讨论情况表明，联合国大多数会员国都谴责美英军队在近东进行的侵略，因为这在这个地区造成了紧张局势。它们都主张美英军队迅速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    葛罗米柯说，除了美英两国的代表和其他一些由于对这两国承担了军事义务和其他义务而被捆住了手足的国家的代表以外，没有人替外国在黎巴嫩和约旦进行的军事干涉辩护。他指出，甚至那些对这个侵略行为要负直接责任的国家的代表们也不得不作出平息群情的保证，尽管这些保证并不责成它们承担任何义务。
    葛罗米柯提到联合国大会上有人认为美英两国是尊重联合国宪章和在实际行动中遵循宪章的这种说法时，强调指出，艾森豪威尔说，美国“保留派遣自己的军队到其他小国去的权利”，这番话无论如何也不能证明美国是尊重联合国宪章的。
    葛罗米柯指出，最近二、三年来，西方的侵略政策不止一次地使世界濒于爆炸的边缘。他着重指出，苏联不能看到中近东地区变为越来越危险的、进行阴谋和挑衅的策源地，变为战争策源地而漠不关心。
    葛罗米柯要求停止英国对约旦的干涉和美国对黎巴嫩的干涉，要求这两个国家把军队从中东撤出去。
    葛罗米柯提醒大会注意关于“间接侵略”是产生中东危机的原因的言论。他指出，联合国观察团的报告证实：黎巴嫩的内政根本没有受到来自邻国的任何外来干涉。
    葛罗米柯接着说，如果说真的有人参与了“间接侵略”而且使“间接侵略”变成了国际关系方面行动的一个组成部分的话，那么这正是美国和英国。只要数一数那些为了推翻阿拉伯东方国家合法政府而从外部策划的许多阴谋，数一数被派往那一地区的人，就可以彻底推翻所谓美英军队开到近东是为了使黎巴嫩和约旦不受外来的某种“间接侵略”的荒谬说法了。
    葛罗米柯还揭露了美英代表团的这种暗示：仿佛是以色列进攻约旦的威胁妨碍英国人迅速从约旦撤军。他说，这种情况只能说是事前策划好的把戏。如果以色列不得到其他国家的支持，就不会发生以色列进攻约旦的危险。
    葛罗米柯还提请大家注意某些西方国家，首先是美国，企图用提出种种经济方案的办法使辩论离开根据苏联倡议而召开的联合国大会紧急特别会议的主要任务，这就是：结束当前由于美英军队开进两个阿拉伯国家的领土而在中近东形成的紧张局势，要求撤退这些军队。
    葛罗米柯说，这完全不等于说，苏联不充分重视给予中近东国家以经济援助和促进它们的发展的问题。相反地，苏联热烈主张协助年轻的东方国家发展经济，巩固它们的独立，而这种协助是不附带任何政治条件或其他条件的。
    葛罗米柯指出，联合国大多数会员国真诚地希望找寻能够缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的解决办法。参加大会的绝大多数国家表示希望同包括苏联代表团在内的各国代表团共同寻找这种解决办法。但是，美英两国代表团并没有这种愿望。为了反对苏联关于美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦并由联合国方面采取相应措施的建议，在大会上提出了一个挂上了挪威的招牌而实质上是美国和英国的货色的提案。这个提案的主要目的是迷惑大会参加者，并造成一种假象，仿佛美国和英国也希望撤退本国军队。这个提案实质上是建议根本不要对紧急会议所讨论的中心问题表示任何意见，一切都信赖美英两国政府的善意和好听的诺言。葛罗米柯说，通过这个提案就是赞成通过一个违背直接有关的阿拉伯国家的意志和合法利益的提案，这个提案又有什么价值呢？
    葛罗米柯说，缓和中近东紧张局势最正确的、最好的办法就是：美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。采纳这条道路不仅会提高联合国的威信，而且也对美英两国的威信有好处。苏联的提案同这个任务正是一致的。
    在晚间会议开始时，某些答应支持美国的“七国”提案的代表继续袒护这个提案。可是这个提案的命运已经决定了。因为尽管美国作了种种努力，并没有得到使这个提案获得大会三分之二的必要多数票的保证。所有阿拉伯国家的代表，除了被占领的黎巴嫩和约旦以外，都一致反对这个提案。
    继续企图强行通过中近东地区国家所反对的关于中近东的提案是毫无意义的，这是大家都看得很清楚的。加纳代表查普曼表达了这种情绪，虽然他没有表示反对“七国”提案。他说：任何解决中近东问题的方法如果得不到这个地区大多数国家的支持，它就是不现实的。我们不能够在联合国强迫某些国家的人民接受违反这些人民意志的任何决定。
    在会议期间人们就已经得知阿拉伯国家的代表团准备提出一个折衷提案。“七国”提案的倡议人在肯定强行通过“七国”提案的企图不会成功以后，对记者们说，阿拉伯国家的提案总的来说是他们可以接受的。这个提案已经草拟好，但是还没有由阿拉伯国家正式提出来。
    在晚间会议上，职业污蔑者、古巴代表努奈斯—波图翁多和以色列代表伊班都为美国武装干涉阿拉伯国家的内政进行辩护。
    在晚间会议上最后发言的是墨西哥代表柯林纳，他表示希望阿拉伯国家的提案将为大会参加者所接受。在柯林纳发言以后，晚间会议宣告结束。
