(Reported by our correspondent Ma Ming from Taiyuan on the 14th) Shanxi Province is establishing a "worker-peasant-soldier" labor army of more than 3.66 million people, combining workers, peasants, and soldiers.

This labor army is composed of male and female peasants in the province between the ages of sixteen and fifty-five and is the backbone force on the agricultural production front. Following the principle of "living militarized, labor militarized," they will drive all male and female able-bodied, semi-able-bodied, and auxiliary laborers in the countryside to continuously advance agricultural production and various socialist constructions in the countryside. Among this labor army of more than three million people, those aged sixteen to forty-five are selected as reserve workers, totaling about 900,000 people in the province (equivalent to 15% of the rural labor force). Among them, those aged sixteen to twenty-five (including 20% to 30% women) are the backbone reserve workers, who will participate in labor in county-run or higher-level industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises according to the principle of relative stability and rotation in batches. Those aged twenty-six to forty-five are ordinary reserve workers, who will serve as temporary workers in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises and large-scale reservoir construction sites as needed. Among the above-mentioned young and middle-aged people aged sixteen to forty-five, young and middle-aged men and women aged sixteen to forty are selected to participate in the militia, among which young men aged eighteen to twenty-five are the backbone militia, and they are also the national reserve soldiers. The organizational system of this labor army is Command (county), Brigade (township), Company (commune), and Platoon.

The establishment of this labor army has been welcomed by the broad masses of peasants in Shanxi Province. At present, more than 1,907,000 peasants in the province have participated in labor, and all publicity, mobilization, and organization work for the establishment of the labor army will be completed by the end of August. The labor army established earlier has already demonstrated the superiority of organization in industrial and agricultural production. A "field regiment" (brigade) in Dongfeng Township, Xin County, participating in the construction of a reservoir, not only completed the militia training task, but also improved labor efficiency by one time. The original plan to build the reservoir in 370 days was completed in fifty days. The original plan to build the Nitun Township Reservoir in Yangqu County in ten days was completed in five days of hard work by a "labor army" composed of 300 people. The "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Division" in Qin County, composed of 5,000 peasants, is mainly composed of demobilized soldiers and militiamen. After the "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Division" was formed, it has already gone to the construction sites of four reservoirs in Zhangyuan, Yueling Mountain, and Xuyang and started intense labor. On the construction site of this labor force, there are libraries, clubs, bathhouses, small hospitals, and sports fields, as well as Red and Expert, literacy, and military schools, to ensure the supply of the material and cultural needs of the labor army. In addition to transferring more than 17,000 "reserve workers" from the already formed labor army to support factories, mines, and railway construction sites, the Yuci Special Zone also sent a "field regiment" (brigade) composed of more than 2,000 people from Qingxu and Jiaocheng counties to participate in the construction of the Fenhe Reservoir project remotely.

This labor army is established to meet the needs of the rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production and construction labor force, to meet the needs of developing the militia in national defense construction, and to carry forward the glorious tradition of the militia's "integration of labor and military affairs." According to the needs of the current comprehensive leap forward plan for industrial and agricultural production in the province, there is a shortage of 1.5 million laborers. In order to solve this new problem in the great leap forward of industry and agriculture, various places have launched mass movements for tool reform and technological innovation, improved labor organization and increased the utilization rate of working hours, established collective canteens and nurseries to liberate women's labor force, and implemented a part-work and part-study education system and labor system, but the problem of labor shortage has not been completely solved. According to the experiment in Yuci Special Zone, the labor efficiency of organizing a labor army combining workers, peasants, and soldiers is about 30% higher than that of ordinary laborers. This labor army not only undertakes arduous and intensive production tasks such as rural water conservancy and infrastructure construction in peacetime, but also, when necessary, can draw a part of the strong labor force to break through the boundaries of communes, townships, counties, and even provinces to support large-scale construction and carry out communist labor cooperation. After the establishment of this labor army, people aged sixteen to twenty-five in the countryside are all backbone reserve workers. They will participate in labor in county-run or higher-level industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises according to the principle of relative stability and rotation in batches. In this way, the task of mobilizing more than 380,000 people to support industrial and transportation construction in the second half of this year can be guaranteed, and the phenomenon of mutual competition for labor force between industrial and agricultural production in many places can be solved. More importantly, this method can cultivate all-round talents needed for national construction. This not only enables peasants who have the conditions to be reserve workers to be tempered by the ideology of the working class and learn the advanced technology of modern industry when they take turns to work in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises and become socialist laborers who can both farm and work, but also when they bring the ideology of the working class, industrial production technology, and advanced scientific knowledge to the countryside, they can also cultivate more talents with a certain cultural and technical level and the ideology of the working class for the agricultural front, thereby accelerating the realization of the technological revolution in the countryside. At the same time, the labor army is also a good organizational form for carrying out political and ideological education and military education for young and middle-aged men and women peasants.

The labor army combining workers, peasants, and soldiers organized by Shanxi Province this time is established on the basis of past militia work, conscription work, and the establishment of a reserve worker system. The militia work in the province has a solid foundation. There are about 1.1 million militiamen aged eighteen to forty, of which about 550,000 are backbone militiamen aged eighteen to twenty-five. The reserve worker system in the province has also had a certain foundation since May this year. When organizing the labor army this time, all localities have established, strengthened, or adjusted on the basis of the original different foundations according to the policy of "both workers and farmers and soldiers" and the new spirit of "integration of labor and military affairs."

    山西建立一支工农兵相结合的劳动大军，他们是：
    农业生产的骨干力量
    工业建设中的预备工
    保卫国家的基干民兵
    本报太原14日电　记者马明报道：山西省农村正在建立一支由三百六十六万多人组成的“亦工亦农亦兵”的工农兵相结合的劳动大军。
    这支劳动大军，是由全省十六周岁至五十五周岁的男女农民组成的，是农业生产战线上的骨干力量。他们根据“生活战斗化、劳动军事化”的原则，将带动农村一切男女全劳力、半劳力、辅助劳力，把农业生产和农村各项社会主义建设不断推向前进。在这支三百多万人的劳动大军中，挑选十六周岁至四十五周岁的人为预备工，全省共约九十万人（等于全省农村劳力的15％）。其中十六周岁到二十五周岁的人（包括20％至30％女性）为基干预备工，他们将根据相对固定、分批轮换的原则到县营以上的工矿交通企业中参加劳动。二十六周岁到四十五周岁的人为普通预备工，他们将根据需要到工矿交通企业和大型水库等建设工地中担任临时工。在上述十六周岁至四十五周岁的青壮年中，挑选十六周岁至四十周岁的男女青壮年参加民兵，其中十八周岁至二十五周岁的男青年为基干民兵，他们同时又是国家的预备兵。这支劳动大军的组织系统是指挥部（县）、大队（乡）、中队（社）、小队。
    这支劳动大军的建立，受到山西省广大农民的欢迎。目前，全省参加劳动的农民已有一百九十万七千多人，建立劳动大军的全部宣传动员、组织工作将在8月底完成。建立较早的劳动大军在工农业生产中已经显示了组织起来的优越性。忻县东风城乡参加建设水库的一个“野战团”（大队），不仅完成了民兵训练的任务，而且劳动效率比一般劳动提高一倍。五十天内即完成了原计划三百七十天修建水库的计划。原计划十天建成的阳曲县泥屯乡水库，经过一支由三百人组成的“劳动大军”五天苦战，便完成了这个水库的建设任务。沁县由五千农民参加的“工农兵师”，是以复员军人和民兵为主组成的。这个“工农兵师”组成以后，已经开赴漳源、月岭山、徐阳等四个水库工地，开始紧张地劳动。在这支劳动部队的工地上，设有图书馆、俱乐部、洗澡塘、小医院、体育场，还有红专、扫盲、军事学校等，保证了劳动大军的物质和文化需要的供应。榆次专区除从已经组成的劳动大军中，调出一万七千多名“预备工”，支援工厂、矿山和铁路建筑工地以外，这个专区的清徐、交城两县还派出两千多人组成的“野战团”（大队）远程参加汾河水库工程的建设。
    这支劳动大军，是根据满足飞跃发展的工农业生产建设的劳动力的需要，满足国防建设中发展民兵的需要和发扬民兵的“劳武结合”的光荣传统建立的。按照目前全省工农业生产全面跃进计划的需要，共缺乏劳动力一百五十万个。为解决这个工农业大跃进中出现的新问题，各地开展了工具改革和技术革新群众运动，改善劳动组织提高工时利用率，建立集体食堂和托儿所解放妇女劳动力；实行半工半读的教育制度和劳动制度，但是劳动力的紧张问题还没有彻底解决。根据榆次专区的试验，组织工农兵相结合的劳动大军，劳动效率比一般劳动者提高30％左右。这支劳动大军不仅在平时担负着农村水利、基本建设等艰巨的突击性的生产任务，而且在必要时，可以抽出一部分壮劳力，突破社界、乡界、县界，甚至省界去支援大规模的建设，进行共产主义的劳力大协作。这支劳动大军建立以后，农村里十六周岁到二十五周岁的人，都是基干预备工。他们将根据相对固定、分批轮换的原则，到县营以上的工矿交通企业中参加劳动。这样就可以使今年下半年动员三十八万多人支援工业交通建设的任务有保证，使许多地方出现的工农业生产互争劳动力的现象得到解决。这个办法更重要的是可以培养出国家建设需要的全能人才。这不仅可以使凡具备预备条件的农民，乘轮流到工矿交通企业劳动的机会，受到工人阶级思想意识的锻炼，学到现代工业的先进技术，成为既能务农又能务工的社会主义劳动者，而且当他们把工人阶级的思想、工业生产技术和先进的科学知识带到农村以后，还可以为农业战线上培养出更多具有一定文化技术水平和工人阶级思想意识的人才，从而加速农村的技术革命的实现。同时劳动大军也是向青壮年男女农民进行政治思想教育、军事教育的一种良好组织形式。
    山西省这次组织的工农兵相结合的劳动大军，是在过去民兵工作、兵役工作和建立预备工制度的基础上建立的。全省的民兵工作有坚强的基础，十八周岁至四十周岁的民兵，约有一百一十万人，其中十八周岁至二十五周岁的基干民兵约有五十五万人。全省的预备工制度，自今年5月开始，也已有一定的基础。各地在这次组织劳动大军的时候，都在原有的不同的基础上，根据“亦工亦农亦兵”的方针和“劳武结合”的新精神，有的是建立，有的是加强，有的是调整。（附图片）
