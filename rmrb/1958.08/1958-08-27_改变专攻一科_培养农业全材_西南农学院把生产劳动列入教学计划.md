Southwest Agricultural College Includes Production Labor in Teaching Plan

(Our report) Southwest Agricultural College, while including production labor in the teaching plan, also emphasizes cultivating students into people who understand both professional knowledge and various agricultural production skills, based on the characteristic that agricultural science itself is a comprehensive science.

After展开a large-scale debate on teaching reform, Southwest Agricultural College recently revised its teaching plans. Production labor education has been included as a course in the teaching plan, stipulating that each teacher and student must participate in production labor for at least two to three and a half days a week. Agricultural labor is combined with planting high-yield fields, and industrial labor is combined with running factories for agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides. The school's experimental fields and factories are both classrooms, laboratories, scientific research bases, high-yield fields, and positions for Marxist-Leninist ideological education. Teachers move the theoretical knowledge they taught in the classroom in the past to the experimental fields to teach while operating. Laboratory experiments and scientific research are closely integrated with practical operations. Now, teachers and students are conducting experiments and research in the experimental fields to strive for a yield of 25,000 jin per mu of late rice, such as "preventing and controlling late rice diseases and insect pests" and applying silicate fertilizer to harden the rice stalks after densely planting rice seedlings. The Department of Agronomy has also established an examination system for labor courses, making labor courses equal to agronomy and other courses.

In order to cultivate students into people who understand both professional knowledge and various agricultural skills, the school stipulates that basic science foundation courses, comprehensive agricultural technology foundation courses, and professional courses are indispensable when formulating teaching plans. To cultivate students into all-rounders in agricultural production, teachers and students in the past often regarded technical foundation courses as optional courses. Those who study plant cultivation do not value soil and agricultural chemistry courses; those who study soil do not value pest and disease control and crop cultivation courses. Therefore, after students graduate and go to the countryside, what they have learned may not be immediately useful, and what urgently needs to be solved in production has not been learned. Based on the above situation, Southwest Agricultural College decided in the teaching plan to cross-arrange comprehensive agricultural technology foundation courses and professional courses so that students can study comprehensive agricultural technology foundation courses from the second grade to the fourth grade.

The inclusion of production labor in the teaching plan by Southwest Agricultural College and the change in curriculum arrangements according to the requirements of cultivating students to become people who understand various agricultural technologies were achieved after a debate and struggle. At first, "skeptics" and "wait-and-seeers" always believed that production labor would make students too tired and affect classes, or that there were irreconcilable contradictions between work-study programs and theoretical study time, which would affect theoretical study, etc. In short, they doubted that work-study programs would affect teaching quality and were "more harm than good." However, most teachers and students refuted the pessimistic arguments of "skeptics" and "wait-and-seeers" with concrete facts. After teachers and students participated in production labor, they understood many things without being told, and they could also operate skillfully. On the issue of cultivating people who understand various agricultural skills, many teachers in the past paid attention to professional courses and neglected agricultural foundation courses. Therefore, they scheduled more professional courses and reduced agricultural foundation courses. This time, when revising the teaching plan, the importance of agricultural foundation courses for cultivating students to understand various agricultural skills was further clarified.

### 改变专攻一科　培养农业全材  西南农学院把生产劳动列入教学计划

　　改变专攻一科　培养农业全材
    西南农学院把生产劳动列入教学计划
    本报讯　西南农学院在把生产劳动列入教学计划的时候，同时根据农业科学本身就是一门综合性科学的特点，重视把学生培养成为既懂得专业知识，又懂得多种农业生产技能的人。
    西南农学院最近在展开教学改革的大辩论后，各系纷纷修订教学计划。把生产劳动教育当作一门课程列入了教学计划，规定每个教师和学生每星期至少有二至三个半天参加生产劳动。农业劳动是与种丰产田相结合，工业劳动就与大办农业机械、农肥、农药等工厂相结合。学校的试验田和工厂既是教室、又是实验室、科学研究基地、丰产田，也是马列主义思想教育的阵地。教师们把过去在课堂里讲授的理论知识，搬到试验田中去一边操作一边讲授。实验室的试验和科学研究紧密结合实际操作进行。现在，师生们正在为争取晚稻亩产二万五千斤在试验田里作“防治晚稻病虫害”和秧苗高度密植以后施矽酸盐肥使苗秆变硬的试验和研究。农学系还订出了劳动课的考查制度，使劳动课与农学等课程平起平坐。
    为了把学生培养成为既懂专业知识，又懂得多种农业技能的人，学校在制订教学计划时，规定基本科学基础课、综合农业技术基础课和专业课三者不可偏废。要培养学生成为农业生产中的多面手，过去教师和学生往往是把技术基础课当作可学可不学的课程。学植物栽培的不重视土壤、农业化学课；学土壤的不重视病虫害和作物栽培等课程。因此，学生们毕业到农村去以后，学到的不一定马上能用上，而生产上急需解决的又没有学到。西南农学院根据上面这种情况，就在教学计划中决定把综合农业技术基础课与专业课进行交叉安排，使学生们从二年级开始到四年级都能学综合农业技术基础课。
    西南农学院把生产劳动列入教学计划和根据培养学生成为懂得多种农业技术的人的要求改变课程安排，是经过了一场辩论和斗争以后才实现的。起初，“怀疑论者”和“观潮派”总认为生产劳动会使学生过于疲劳，影响上课，或说勤工俭学与理论学习时间上有不可调和的矛盾，会影响理论学习等。总之，就是怀疑勤工俭学会影响教学质量，是“得不偿失”。但是大多师生用具体的事实批驳了“怀疑论者”和“观潮派”的促退论调。教师和学生参加生产劳动以后，许多东西不讲他们也懂得了，并且还能熟练操作。在培养懂得多种农业技能的人的问题上，过去许多教师都重视专业课而忽视农业基础课，因此，排课时多排专业课而减少农业基础课。这次在修订教学规划时，才进一步明确农业基础课对培养学生人人懂得多种农业技能的重要性。（附图片）
