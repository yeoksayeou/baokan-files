The People's Commune is a Big Garden of Joy for Everyone
　　Tang Feixiao
　　I consider my visit to the Satellite Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, a blessing. The commune is full of lively and joyous scenes everywhere. The members are all spirited and full of energy. Under the shining sun, they stride forward towards communism with their heads held high.
　　There are countless things worth praising here. I can only offer a few glimpses of what I have seen and heard to refresh the readers.
　　This commune is formed by the merger of twenty-seven agricultural cooperatives, encompassing more than 40,000 people.
　　After the agricultural cooperative became a commune, it is no longer a simple agricultural production organization. Its functions are much more extensive than those of an agricultural cooperative. It truly integrates industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, covering all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and military. From the organizational structure, it also resembles a small “country.” For example, it has an industrial department, an agricultural technology department, a finance and economics department, a cultural, educational, and health department, a military security department, as well as a forestry department, a water conservancy department, a breeding department, a transportation department, etc., a total of more than a dozen departments. It even has a “foreign affairs department” and “ambassadors” stationed in other communes, specifically responsible for strengthening collaboration and exchanging experiences with other entities.
　　The name "Satellite Commune" comes from the fact that it launched high-yield wheat "satellites" during the summer harvest. This summer, the commune harvested more than 40 million catties of grain. The entire commune is filled with the joy of a bumper harvest. Comrade Chen Bingyin, the Party Secretary, has been so happy since the wheat harvest that he hasn't slept well. He always greets people with a smile. In the past, people couldn't eat for very long after the wheat harvest, but this year, they can't finish all the white flour. Commune members reflect that what they are worried about now is not the lack of grain, but the lack of places to store it. Isn't that right? The 20th Brigade of the commune even had their dining hall occupied by grain, and for a while, they didn't even have a fixed place to eat.
　　The bumper harvest has further liberated people's minds. Based on this year's bumper wheat harvest, some commune members have raised their planned wheat yield per mu for next year to over 10,000 catties; some have raised their planned rice yield per mu this year from 10,000 catties to 50,000 catties; some have raised their sweet potato yield per mu from 400,000 catties to 600,000 catties. In a sweet potato field, commune members plowed to a depth of 1.2 zhang, applying a layer of fertilizer for every chi they plowed. How can crops grown in this way not create miracles?
　　After the establishment of the commune, the labor organization has become more complete and strengthened. One morning, I went to visit the commune's fields and encountered a line of people, carrying rakes, singing songs, and moving neatly towards a green rice field. I went closer to inquire and found out that it was a "Rice Paddy Battalion" of the Satellite Commune. The predecessor of the "Rice Paddy Battalion" was the rice specialty team. The commune members themselves say that this is called "militarization." It is faster in action, more intense in life, more cheerful in spirit, and more efficient in production than the specialty team, so this system has developed rapidly. Now, the Satellite Commune has established a total of twenty-seven production regiments and eighty-seven specialized battalions, with more than 20,000 production fighters. They play a pioneering and assault role in production. If in the past, some people always felt that farmers were "scattered" and "backward," today's facts tell us that today's new type of farmers are already organized and disciplined production combat troops.
　　Almost all members of the Satellite Commune are now eating in public canteens. The public canteen originally developed from the agricultural busy season canteen established during the busy farming season. After a trial run during this year's summer harvest and planting period, everyone tasted the sweetness, and the commune members compiled the benefits of it into a jingle: "The canteen is really good, less grain and firewood are used, you eat well and get your fill, but you spend very little; it simplifies household chores, more labor is available for work; you go to the fields quickly and neatly, improving the rate of production." Especially the female commune members, because they can participate in production after being liberated from the kitchen, are full of praise for the canteen. Therefore, the commune members demanded that the canteen be regularized. According to a rough calculation, the manpower saved after establishing public canteens is equivalent to adding more than 4,000 full-time laborers to the entire commune!
　　After the autumn harvest, the grain of the Satellite Commune will no longer be distributed according to work points, but according to population, and each commune member can get grain according to their ration. After the autumn harvest, the commune will implement a wage system. In addition to receiving grain according to ration, commune members will also be paid a certain amount of wages each month based on their labor strength, the level of their production technology, and the quality of their work attitude. Now, the commune members are looking forward to the implementation of the wage system day and night. They believe that after the implementation of the wage system, the commune members can gradually become members of the working class.
　　After the autumn harvest, the commune will implement a public medical care and old-age insurance system. At that time, people can receive free medical treatment when they are sick, and the "five guarantees" households who are old and have no labor force can enter nursing homes. In this way, the sick will be treated, and the elderly will be taken care of.
　　I chatted with Zhong Qingde, the chairman of the Satellite Commune, and asked what their commune needs most now. He said: "Our commune lacks nothing now, except for one thing: tractors." That is indeed the case. Speaking of grain, the commune harvests so much that it can't finish it all itself. Speaking of pork, each person averages 200 catties a year, which they can't possibly finish. By next year, each person can also have 24 catties of vegetable oil, 30 catties of sugar, 100 chi of cloth, and one catty of fruit every day. The commune has also made a plan to build commune member dormitories, office buildings for the management committee, clubs, schools, nurseries, cinemas..., to build the commune into a big garden.
　　After the autumn harvest, for the members of the Satellite Commune, it will be a day full of joy and happiness. The commune members are welcoming the arrival of this happy period with incomparable enthusiasm and intense labor. I also sincerely congratulate all the commune members.

　　人民公社是万人欢乐的大花园
　　唐飞霄
    我把访问河南省遂平县的卫星公社，当作一种幸福。社里到处都是热烈欢乐的景象。社员们个个意气风发，干劲冲天。在旭日的照耀下，昂首阔步地向着共产主义迈进。
    这里值得歌颂的事是不胜枚举的，我只能提供见闻点滴，以新读者耳目。
    这个社是一个由二十七个农业社合并而成，包括四万多人的公社。
    农业社变成公社以后，它就不再是单纯的农业生产组织了。它的职能要比农业社多得多。真是工农商学兵五位一体，政治经济文化军事面面俱全。从组织机构看，它也活像个小小“国家”，比如它有工业部、农业技术部、财经部、文教卫生部、军事保卫部、还有林业部、水利部、饲养部、交通部等等，一共是十几个部，甚至它还有“外交部”和驻外社的“大使”，是专门来负责同社外联络加强协作交流经验的。
    卫星公社这个名称的由来，是因为它在夏收时放射了小麦高产“卫星”。今年夏季，公社一共收了四千多万斤粮食。全社充满着一片丰收的喜悦，党委书记陈丙寅同志自麦收以来，乐得没有睡过好觉，见了人总是喜笑颜开的。在过去，人们麦收以后吃不了多久，可是今年，白面吃不清。社员们反映，现在发愁的，不是粮食不够吃，而是多得没有地方放。可不是吗？社里第二十大队，就因为粮食把食堂占了，一时连吃饭也没有一个固定地方。
    丰收进一步解放了人们的思想。在今年小麦丰收的基础上，有的社员把明年的小麦亩产计划提高到一万斤以上；有的社员把今年的水稻亩产量，由一万斤提高到五万斤；有的社员把红薯的亩产量由四十万斤提高到六十万斤。在一块红薯地里，社员们深翻了一丈二尺，他们翻一尺深，铺一层肥，再翻一尺，再铺一层。这样长出来的庄稼，怎能不创造奇迹呢？
    公社建立以后，劳动组织更加健全和强化了。一天早晨，我去参观公社的田野，碰见一列队伍，扛着耙，唱着歌，很整齐地向着一块绿油油的稻田前进。我走近一打听，原来是卫星公社的一个“水稻营”。“水稻营”的前身就是水稻专业队。社员们自己说这叫“军事化”，它比专业队更加行动迅速、生活紧张、精神愉快、生产效率高，所以这种制度很快的发展了。现在卫星公社一共建立了二十七个生产团，八十七个专业营，有两万多名生产战士，他们在生产上起着先锋、突击的作用。如果在过去，有人总觉得农民“散漫”“落后”，现在的事实告诉我们，今天的新型农民，已经是有组织守纪律的生产战斗部队了。
    卫星公社的社员们，差不多已全部都在公共食堂吃饭。公共食堂本来是由农忙季节成立的农忙食堂发展起来的。这种带临时性的农忙食堂，经过今年夏收夏种时期的试办，大家尝到了甜头，社员们把它的好处编成了小快板：“食堂真是好，粮柴用的少，吃的饱又好，花钱却很少；简化家务活，劳力出勤多；下地快又齐，提高生产率”。尤其是妇女社员，因为从厨房里解放出来以后，可以参加生产，对食堂更是赞不绝口。因此，社员们要求把食堂经常化起来。大体计算一下，建立公共食堂以后节省出来的人工，等于给全社增添了四千多个常年劳动力！
    卫星公社秋收以后的粮食，将不再按劳动日分配，而是按人口分配，每个社员都可以按自己的定量分得粮食。秋收以后，社里将实行工资制。社员除了按定量分得粮食以外，还根据每个社员的劳力强弱、生产技术的高低和劳动态度的好坏等条件，每月发给一定数量的工资。现在社员们都日夜盼望着实现工资制。他们认为实行了工资制以后，社员们就可以逐渐变成工人阶级了。
    秋收以后，社里将实行公费医疗和养老制度。那时候，有病可以免费医疗，年老没有劳动力的“五保”户，可以进养老院养老。这样一来，就病有所医，老有所养了。
    我和卫星公社主席钟清德同志闲聊，问起他们社里现在最需要什么，他说：“我们公社现在什么也不缺，就是缺一样：拖拉机。”的确是这样。说粮食，公社打的粮食自己吃不清，说猪肉，每人一年平均二百斤，怎么也吃不完，到明年，每人还可以有二十四斤植物油，三十斤糖，一百尺布，每天一斤水果，公社还作了一个规划，要盖社员宿舍、管理委员会的办公大楼、俱乐部、学校、托儿所、电影院……，要把公社建成一个大花园。
    秋收以后，对于卫星公社的社员们来说，将是个充满了欢乐和幸福的日子。社员们正在以无比奋发的精神，紧张的劳动，来迎接这个幸福的时期到来。我也衷心地向全体社员们祝贺。
