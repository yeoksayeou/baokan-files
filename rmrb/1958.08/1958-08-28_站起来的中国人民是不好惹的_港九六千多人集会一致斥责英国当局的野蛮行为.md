Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 27th: Hong Kong news: This morning, representatives from more than 100 labor unions, schools, and various social organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon, totaling more than 6,000 people, gathered at the square of the China Middle School to hold a rally to express their condolences to the teachers and students of China Middle School. They spoke at the meeting, condemning the Hong Kong British authorities for unreasonably closing the China Middle School campus and dispatching armed police to beat teachers, students, and Chinese journalists.

　　This condolence meeting was held in the temporary shelter that construction workers in Hong Kong had worked overnight to build for the teachers and students of China Middle School. People from all walks of life who came to express their condolences filled the entire shelter and the roadsides around it. Although it was raining heavily during the meeting, it could not stop the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong from enthusiastically supporting China Middle School.

Huang Zufen, the principal of China Middle School, reported the experience of being persecuted and then pointed out: "This barbaric act of the Hong Kong British authorities simply means they have eyes but cannot see Mount Tai. The Chinese people who have stood up are not to be bullied."

Your just struggle will surely be victorious.

　　Representatives from ten labor children's schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon accused the Hong Kong British authorities at the meeting of persecuting the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong on the one hand, and condoning schools controlled by US-Chiang secret agents to carry out various anti-China political conspiracies on the other. She emphasized that this is a manifestation of the Hong Kong authorities' use of the so-called "Two Chinas" plot, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. She warned the Hong Kong British authorities: They must immediately stop the persecution of the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people.

　　More than sixty student representatives from ten Hong Kong government schools, church schools, and English colleges, including Hong Kong King's College, also attended today's condolence meeting and read out their letters of condolence. The letter wrote: We express our utmost anger and lodge a solemn protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' forcible closure of the China Middle School campus and the use of armed police to unreasonably beat teachers, students, and Chinese journalists. This incident will make all righteous people realize the true face of the Hong Kong British authorities. The letter of condolence said: Although we are poisoned by "enslavement education," we are Chinese, we love the People's Republic of China, and we cannot be "enslaved." We firmly support the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong.

　　Representatives of school teachers from Hong Kong and Kowloon districts, trade union representatives from Taikoo Dockyard, representatives from the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, and representatives from the financial and trade circles, legal circles, medical circles, journalism circles, publishing circles, and film circles also spoke at the condolence meeting. They unanimously condemned and protested against the crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities.
