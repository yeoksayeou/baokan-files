　　Skeptics Have Boarded the Boat
　　Zhang Pei
　　The emergence of new things is often not immediately welcomed, which is why thought often lags behind reality. The rice transplanter boat is a very obvious example. This kind of farm tool is easy to make, cheap, and has great utility. It can both reduce labor intensity, increase speed, and guarantee 100% the planting specifications for close planting. However, when it was promoted, it aroused the opposition of some farmers. They said: "There has never been such a thing since ancient times." "The ghost talks ghostly, how can transplanting be good on a boat?"
　　However, because new things have great vitality, they always shout loudly to fight for their right to exist, until they win. The rice transplanter boat has finally been promoted in rural areas and has been loved by farmers, which proves the invincible philosophical principle of new things.
　　Victory always comes through struggle. How do we conduct the struggle? First, visit, which played a promoting role, but some still don't believe it after seeing it; second, ask them to sit down and try it. Some said it was good after sitting, but some shook their heads and didn't sit. How to transform these more stubborn people? The masses themselves created a good method to resolve this internal contradiction: competition.
　　When I participated in the experience summary work of agricultural tool reform in the Shanbing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chaoyang County, I heard a vivid description of this rich and diverse competition. The competition was launched when the debate in the field was in full swing. There, the struggle between reformers and conservatives laid a solid foundation for victory after three rounds of competition. The first round was a competition with the same conditions. The same field, divided into two areas of the same size, two people against two people, one side using the rice transplanter boat, and the other side standing and transplanting. The result was: the side that was standing and transplanting planted and planted, and seeing that it was not the right way, they quickly abandoned their armor and dragged their soldiers, and fled to another field, saying: "No more competition, no more competition." The second round was one-on-one, but in addition to the rice transplanter boat, the opposition saw that it was not working and also pulled a small stool into the field to participate in the competition. The result was another complete victory for the rice transplanter boat. The third round was a competition with unequal strength, 10 to 13. The result was that thirteen people stood and transplanted, which seemed to be a little faster than one-on-one on the surface, but when the specifications were checked, they were cutting corners. When transplanting according to the specifications, the rice transplanter boat still won.
　　The opposition was established, and it was overcome through competition, and we moved forward. Opponents became supporters, and they also spoke good words for the rice transplanter boat. Bad things turned into good things, and new farm tools were promoted. People who didn't believe it before couldn't help laughing when they sat on the boat to transplant rice: "It's really good to transplant rice while sitting, the Communist Party has a really good way, they came up with a rice transplanter boat for close planting."
　　The method of competition is in line with the principle of dialectical materialism of understanding things from practice, and it is also in line with the basic law of the unity and struggle of opposites in materialist dialectics and the principle that contradiction is the driving force of progress. This method is more suitable for dealing with internal contradictions between the advanced and the backward, because this kind of competition is a friendly competition; this kind of struggle is a struggle carried out on the basis of unity.
　　"Competition" has served advanced things in agricultural tool reform, and has proved that it serves very well. In the future, it will open up a path for all new things in the much wider technical revolution.

　　怀疑派上船了
　　章沛
    新东西的出现，往往是不容易马上受到欢迎的，这就叫做思想往往落后于现实。插秧船是个很显明的例子。这种农具，容易造，价格便宜，功用大。既可以减轻劳动强度，又可以增加速率，更可以百分之百地保证密植的插秧规格。然而，推广的时候，却引起了某些农民的反对。他们说：“从古以来，没有这事。”“鬼人讲鬼话，哪有插秧好坐船。”
    然而，由于新东西具有巨大的生命力，因此，它总是要大叫大嚷，争取它存在的权利，一直到胜利为止。插秧船到底在农村中推广了，而且获得农民的喜爱，正说明了新生事物不可战胜的哲学原理。
    胜利总是要经过斗争的，怎样进行斗争呢？一是参观，这起了推动作用，但看了也还有不相信的；二是请他们坐着试一下，有的坐了说好，但有的却摇摇头不坐。怎样使这些较顽固者转变呢？群众自己创造了一个解决这种内部矛盾的好方法，比赛。
    我在潮阳县山柄农业生产合作社参加农具改革的经验总结工作时，听到这种丰富多样的比赛的生动叙述。比赛是在田间论辩争得不可开交的时候搞起来的。他们那里，革新派和保守派的斗争，经过了三个回合的比赛，奠定了胜利基础。第一个回合是条件相同的比赛。同一片田，划两个同大的区，二人对二人，一边用插秧船，一边站着插。结果是：站着插的一方插呀插的，看看不是头路，连忙弃甲曳兵，逃到别片田去，嘴里说：“不比了，不比了。”第二个回合是个对个，可是除了插秧船，反对派一看不行把小凳子也拉进田里参加比赛了，结果又是插秧船全胜。第三个回合是不等力量的比赛，10比13，结果十三人站着插，表面看来好像比一对一快了一些，可是一查规格，他们却是偷工减料。一照规格插，还是插秧船胜利了。
    对立面树立了，又经过比赛克服了，我们也就前进了。反对者变成拥护者，他们也来替插秧船说好话，坏事变成好事，新农具也就推广开来。原来不相信的人，当他坐在船上插秧时，忍不住哈哈大笑起来：“果然坐着好插秧，共产党真好办法，搞密植就想出个插秧船。”
    比赛的方法，是符合于辩证唯物主义的从实践中认识事物的原理的，也是符合于唯物辩证法对立面的统一及斗争的基本规律和矛盾是前进的动力的原理的，而这种方法，又更适用于处理先进与落后之间的内部矛盾，因为这种比赛，是友谊的比赛；这种斗争，是在统一的基础上进行的斗争。
    “比赛”，它已经在农具改革中，为先进事物服了务，并且证实它服务得很好。今后，它将在更广泛得多的技术革命中，为所有的新生事物开辟前进的道路。
