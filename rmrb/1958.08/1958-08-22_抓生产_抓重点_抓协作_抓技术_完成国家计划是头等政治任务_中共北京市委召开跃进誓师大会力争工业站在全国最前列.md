    Completing the National Plan is the Top Political Task
    Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Convened a Leap Forward Swearing-in Meeting to Strive for Industry to Stand at the Forefront of the Country
    (Our newspaper's report) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a leap forward swearing-in meeting for industry, handicrafts, and transportation industries with more than 50,000 people at the Temple of Heaven Park on the evening of the 21st, and made arrangements for a new leap forward in industrial production. The meeting called on all factories and handicraft production cooperatives in the city to take the Party's general line for socialist construction as a weapon, conduct extensive airing of views, great debates on the various problems existing in the production leap forward by factory, workshop, work section, and group, and on this ideological basis, strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan and the unit's leap forward plan, so that all major indicators of industrial production in the capital stand at the forefront of the country.
    Beijing's industrial production this year has achieved great results after three leap forwards. The total output value for the first seven months increased by 45% compared with the same period last year, completing 71.2% of the annual national plan. Product quality, trial manufacture and production of new products have been significantly improved and increased compared with last year, and production costs have also been greatly reduced. However, the development situation in various factories and cooperatives is very uneven. Its common law is: all factories and cooperatives that put politics in command, mobilize the masses, rely on their own efforts, dare to think and dare to do, and work hard and diligently have leapt forward again and again, creating many miracles in production, and many small and poor factories have performed particularly well in this regard; while all those who reach out for help and talk about conditions are actually conservatives in industrial production, and their production plans are generally not well completed. The meeting advocated the former and opposed the latter, and pointed out that the best way to overcome this right-leaning conservative thinking is to hand over the task indicators to the masses for extensive airing of views and great debates.
    Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Jia Tingsan, Standing Committee Member, spoke at the meeting. The factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and Communist Youth League secretaries of seven factories also expressed their determination to make a great leap forward in production at the meeting.
    In his speech, Jia Tingsan made a specific analysis of the current industrial production situation in the city, calling on the workers in the capital to overcome difficulties and continue to leap forward on the basis of the victories already achieved. He said that the characteristic of the current situation is: if you don't advance, you will retreat. In order to achieve another leap forward, Jia Tingsan requested that each factory, workshop, work section, and group, in accordance with the requirements of the general line of socialist construction, and at the same time compare with the advanced units in the city, the country, and the world, conduct an inspection of the production situation in the first seven months of this year, and on the basis of everyone understanding the problems, re-formulate the unit's leap forward plan and specific measures, and insert red flags on all indicators.
    Jia Tingsan then talked about completing the national plan, collaboration, and the technological revolution. He pointed out that the national plan must be resolutely completed, and collaboration should be carried out on the basis of first completing the national plan. He criticized some factories for using barter methods to solve the difficulty of raw materials, pointing out that this method can easily lead to departmentalism. People who use this method only see the interests of their own unit and do not see the interests of the overall situation, thus violating the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and slowing down the speed of socialist construction. Therefore, this method must be stopped.
    Jia Tingsan said that in solving the problem of machinery and raw material difficulties, we must first ensure and obey the needs of metallurgy, machinery, and power generation equipment. The technological revolution should be closely linked to the current problems existing in production. On this issue, departmentalism is not allowed. Then, he put forward the following six specific measures: 1. Strengthen the Party's leadership over industrial production. The Party committee of each factory and cooperative must study production once a week, and study it nineteen times this year; 2. The factory director and Party committee secretary participate in production labor, and absorb some workers to participate in enterprise management; 3. The factory director divides the management of infrastructure construction and production; 4. Cadres engage in "experimental plots"; 5. Seize the production of raw materials and equipment; 6. Abide by discipline and implement the national plan.
    The leading cadres of seven factories then spoke. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently mobilized the masses to extensively air their views and conducted a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the leap forward plan, posting more than 70,000 big-character posters in three days, criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of lacking confidence in the face of difficulties. Xiao Ping, the First Secretary of the Party Committee of this factory, said at the meeting that the new leap forward plan proposed by the workers would increase the total output value by 30 million yuan compared with last year, and the growth rate would exceed the growth figures of the past five years in one year this year; in terms of infrastructure construction, steelmaking, rolling equipment, and new blast furnaces, coke ovens, and sintering plants are also completed ahead of schedule. According to this speed, the original goal of "building a base with three years of hard work and completing the ten-year plan in four years" can be raised to completing the ten-year plan in two years. Xiao Ping also talked about the measures to ensure the realization of this new leap forward plan.
    The person in charge of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, which has overfulfilled the national plan for January to July by 66.27%, the Electron Tube Factory, which completed the production task for the first half of the year one and a half months ahead of schedule, and the Beijing Steel Plant, which completed the expansion task of producing 200,000 tons of steel annually in three months, reported on the production situation and expressed their determination to further leap forward.
    Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, finally said that there are still 133 days left until the end of the year, and time is very tight. We must act quickly and not relax for even a day or an hour.

    完成国家计划是头等政治任务
    中共北京市委召开跃进誓师大会力争工业站在全国最前列
    本报讯  中共北京市委21日晚在天坛公园召开了五万多人的工业手工业交通运输业跃进誓师大会，对工业生产再跃进进行了部署。大会要求全市各厂和各手工业生产合作社，以党的社会主义建设总路线为武器，把生产跃进中所存在的各种问题，按厂、车间、工段和小组分别进行大鸣大放大辩论，并在这个思想基础上，力争完成和超额完成国家计划和本单位的跃进计划，使首都工业生产中的各项主要指标都站在全国最前列。
    北京市今年的工业生产经过三次跃进，已取得了很大的成绩。前七个月的生产总值比去年同期增长45％，完成全年国家计划71.2％，产品质量、新产品的试制和生产都较去年有显著的提高和增加，生产成本也有了很大的降低。但是在各厂、社中，发展情况很不平衡。它的共同规律是：凡是政治挂帅、发动群众、自力更生、敢想敢干、穷干苦干的厂、社，都一跃再跃，在生产上创造出很多奇迹，许多小厂、穷厂在这方面表现得尤为突出；而一切伸手派和条件论者，实际上则是工业生产中的保守派，他们的生产计划一般都完成得不好。大会提倡前者，反对后者，并且指出克服这种右倾保守思想的最好的办法，就是把任务指标交给群众大鸣大放大辩论。
    中共北京市委第一书记彭真、书记处书记郑天翔、常务委员贾庭三在会上讲了话。有七个工厂的厂长、党委书记、团委书记也在会上表示了生产大跃进的决心。
    贾庭三在讲话中对当前全市的工业生产情况作了具体的分析，号召首都工人在已经取得胜利的基础上，克服困难，不断跃进。他说，当前形势的特点是：不进则退。为了实现再跃进，贾庭三要求各厂以厂、车间、工段、小组为单位，根据社会主义建设总路线的要求，同时和本市的、全国的和世界上的先进单位作比较，就今年前七个月的生产情况进行检查，在人人弄清问题的基础上，再订出本单位的跃进计划和具体措施，在各种指标上都插上红旗。
    贾庭三接着讲述了完成国家计划、协作和技术革命等问题。他指出国家计划必须坚决完成，协作应在首先完成国家计划的基础上去进行。他批评现在有些工厂在解决原材料困难时采用以物易物的办法，指出这种办法很容易产生本位主义。采用这种办法的人，只看到本单位的利益，看不到全局的利益，因此违反了多快好省，搞慢了社会主义建设的速度。因此，这种办法必须制止。
    贾庭三说，在解决机械和原材料困难的问题上，首先要保证和服从冶金、机械、发电的设备的需要。技术革命应密切联系当前生产中存在的问题。在这个问题上，不允许有本位主义。接着，他提出了如下六项具体措施：一、加强党对工业生产的领导，各厂社的党委每周必须研究生产一次，在今年内要研究十九次；二、厂长、党委书记参加生产劳动，吸收部分工人参加企业管理；三、厂长分工管理基建和生产；四、干部搞“试验田”；五、抓紧原材料和设备的生产；六、遵守纪律，执行国家计划。
    七个工厂的领导干部接着发言。石景山钢铁厂最近发动群众大鸣大放，对跃进计划的执行情况，进行了全面大检查，三天内贴出七万多张大字报，批判了在困难面前信心不足的右倾保守思想。这个厂的党委第一书记萧平在会上说，职工们提出的新的跃进计划，生产总值比去年增加三千万元，增长幅度，今年一年即将超过过去五年的增长数字；在基本建设上，炼钢、轧钢设备和新的高炉、焦炉、烧结厂等工程也都跟着提前完成。按照这个速度就可把原定的“苦战三年建成基地，十年计划四年完成”的目标，提高到十年计划两年完成。萧平还讲述了保证实现这个新的跃进计划的措施。
    已超额66.27％完成1至7月份国家计划的京西矿务局、提前一个半月完成了上半年的生产任务的电子管厂、在三个月内完成了年产二十万吨钢扩建任务的北京钢厂的负责人，都汇报了生产情况和表示了进一步跃进的决心。
    市委书记处书记郑天翔最后说，现在离年底还有一百三十三天，时间非常紧迫，我们必须迅速行动起来，一天一小时也不能放松。
