　　Fujian Yinghu Cooperative Reclaims High-Yield Champion
　　Peanut Yield of 13,241 Jin per Mu
　　(Our Newspaper's Dispatch) The peanut high-yield in the Yinghu Cooperative, Longhu Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, has shown an even greater miracle, creating a national record high of over 13,000 jin per mu.
　　This year, the Yinghu Cooperative planted 1,310 mu of peanuts and has harvested 252 mu, yielding a total of 758,160 jin of wet peanuts. After drying, the actual yield was 530,712 jin of dry peanuts, averaging 2,106 jin per mu. Among them, the peanut high-yield experimental plot of 1.001 mu in the Second Team of the Tenth Squad of Kengbian Village actually yielded 13,254 jin and five liang of dry peanuts, averaging 13,241 jin and one liang per mu. This is 908 jin and one liang higher than the 12,333 jin of the Five-Star Cooperative in Chenggong Township, Nan'an County, reclaiming the national peanut high-yield champion. According to reliable estimates, the cooperative has about 50 mu of unharvested peanuts that will yield over 10,000 jin per mu. During the harvest, Liang Zixin, the County Party Secretary, Zhao Huachang, the Director of the Organization Department, Ke Liankun, the Deputy Secretary of the Supervisory Committee, and the Party Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of various townships who were attending the expanded cadre meeting in the county, all rushed to the site to visit, congratulate, reweigh and verify the yield.
　　In order to reward the Yinghu Cooperative for the outstanding achievement they had created, the County Party Committee awarded the cooperative on the spot a roller bearing waterwheel, three deep plows, three peanut threshers, a large red flag, and a certificate. Each person participating in the high-yield experimental plot was awarded a medal and several daily necessities.
　　This plot of peanuts was planted on second-class land by the stream. When harvesting, there was a shortage of manpower, and members of other teams in the cooperative also ran over to help voluntarily. The peanuts filled all 95 large bamboo baskets and 16 large sacks in the team, forming a long dragon. The peanuts left on the ground without bags formed a small mountain.

　　福建英湖社再夺高产冠军
　　花生亩产13241斤
    本报讯　福建省晋江县龙湖乡英湖社花生高产又出现更大奇迹，创造了亩产一万三千多斤的全国最高纪录。
    英湖社今年花生种植一千三百一十亩，已收成二百五十二亩，共收湿花生七十五万八千一百六十斤；经晒后实收干花生五十三万零七百一十二斤，平均亩产二千一百零六斤，其中坑边村十中队二小队花生丰产试验田一点零零一亩，实收干花生一万三千二百五十四斤五两，平均亩产一万三千二百四十一斤一两，比南安县成功乡五星社一万二千三百三十三斤又高出九百零八斤一两，再夺全国花生高产冠军。据可靠估算，全社尚未收成亩产万斤以上的花生，有五十亩左右。收成时县委书记梁子新，组织部长赵华昌，监委会副书记柯连坤等以及正在县开扩大干部会议的各乡党委书记、副书记都赶到现场参观祝贺，并进行复秤验收。
    为了奖励英湖社所创造的这一卓越成绩，县委当场奖给该社滚珠轴承水车一架、深耕犁三部、花生脱粒机三台、大红旗一面、奖状一张。参加高产试验田的每人奖给奖章一枚及日用品数件。
    这丘花生种在溪边的二等地上。收成时人力不足，别队社员也自动跑来支援。花生把队里九十五个大箩筐和十六个大麻袋全部装满，排成一条大长龙；留在地里没袋装的花生又堆成一座小山。
