　　The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind
　　The east wind prevailing over the west wind is a characteristic of our era. Especially in peaceful economic competition, the superiority of the socialist system is very evident.
　　Just speaking of the few months since the beginning of 1958, socialist countries have continued to achieve inspiring successes in their economies.
　　According to statistics, the proportion of socialist countries in world industrial production has increased from about one-third in 1957 to 38%-40%. This should be said to be a leap forward.
　　In terms of the speed of production growth, capitalist countries are far behind, as has been proven by many facts. Just comparing the Soviet Union and the United States, in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of last year, Soviet industrial production increased by more than 11%, while the United States decreased by 11%.
　　A comparison of the production of several major industrial products such as steel, oil, coal, and automobiles in the Soviet Union and the United States during the same period shows that the Soviet Union is making great progress, while the United States is retreating sharply.
　　Currently, the economies of socialist countries are advancing by leaps and bounds, flourishing, and the living standards of the people are gradually improving; while the economies of capitalist countries are mired in the quagmire of crisis, the production lines are bleak, and the working people who have been hit by the crisis have to struggle on the brink of death. In the United States and some other capitalist countries, with the deepening of the economic crisis, countless families are homeless every day because they cannot afford to pay rent; while in socialist countries, countless working people's families move into new homes every day!
　　In the economic competition between the two systems, who will win and who will lose? Is the socialist system superior or is the capitalist system superior? The facts have answered these questions. Faced with the iron facts, even Westerners have to admit defeat. For example, an article recently published in the American magazine "New Republic" entitled "After the West Surrenders" admits that the socialist camp holds the key to the future. By the end of 1957, the industrial production of socialist countries accounted for the world's industrial production: At present, the production of socialist countries is advancing by leaps and bounds, while capitalist countries are in an economic crisis. Therefore, the industrial production of socialist countries accounts for the world's: (with pictures)
　　Top image: Pyongyang, which was destroyed into ruins by American imperialism five years ago, is now full of new buildings. This is the scene of Kim Ki-won, a worker at the Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory, and his family happily moving into their new home.
　　Bottom image: This woman living in New York City was evicted by the landlord because her husband was unemployed and could not afford to pay the rent. Look, the furniture is thrown all over the ground, and they are full of sadness and disappointment. What awaits them, like thousands of American unemployed workers' families, is homelessness.

　　东风压倒西风
    东风压倒西风，是我们这个时代的特征。特别是在和平经济竞赛中，社会主义制度的优越性就表现得非常显明。
    单说1958年开始以来的几个月吧，社会主义国家都在经济上继续取得了振奋人心的成就。
    根据统计，目前社会主义国家在全世界工业生产中所占的比重，已由1957年的三分之一左右增长到38％—40％。这应该说是一个飞跃的进展。
    就生产增长的速度来说，资本主义国家是瞠乎其后的，这已由许多事实加以证明了。仅就苏联和美国相比吧，今年第一季度同去年第一季度相比，苏联工业生产增长了11％以上，而美国却下降了11％。
    对比苏美两国在同一时期几种主要工业产品如钢、石油、煤和汽车的生产情况，就可以看出：苏联在长足进展，而美国则是猛烈后退。
    当前，社会主义国家的经济正在突飞猛进，欣欣向荣，人民生活水平逐步得到提高；而资本主义国家的经济却陷入危机的泥潭，生产线上一片凄凉，遭到危机袭击的劳动人民不得不在死亡线上挣扎。在美国和其他一些资本主义国家，随着经济危机的深刻化，每天因付不出房租而流落街头的家庭何止千万；而在社会主义国家，每天搬进新居的劳动人民家庭又何止万千！
    在两个制度的经济竞赛中，谁胜谁负？社会主义制度优越还是资本主义制度优越？事实对这些问题作出了答复。面对着铁的事实，就连西方人士也不得不服输了。例如，美国“新共和”杂志最近刊载的一篇题为“在西方投降以后”的文章中就承认，社会主义阵营掌握着未来的关键。到1957年年底社会主义国家工业生产已占全世界工业生产的：目前，社会主义国家的生产突飞猛进，而资本主义国家陷入经济危机，因此，社会主义国家的工业生产已占全世界的：（附图片）
    上图：五年前曾被美帝国主义破坏成废墟的平壤市，今天到处耸立着一幢幢崭新的楼房。这是平壤纺织机器厂工人金基元一家人高高兴兴搬进新居的情形。
    下图：这位生活在纽约市的妇女，因为丈夫失业付不起房租而被房主赶出来了。看，家具扔得满地，他们满脸都是悲伤和失望，等候他们的跟成千上万的美国失业工人家庭一样，是流落街头。
