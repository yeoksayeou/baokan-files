　　Based on Kinship, Extending a Helping Hand
    The North Korean Government Decides to Relieve the Suffering Compatriots in the South
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 21st: The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a plenary meeting today, presided over by Premier Kim Il-sung. The meeting made a decision to relieve unemployed people, wandering orphans, and needy students in South Korea.
    The decision stated that the Cabinet of the Republic cannot but be concerned about the plight of compatriots in South Korea. Out of the unanimous fraternal feelings of all the people in North Korea, it has been decided to provide, free of charge, 150,000 "seok" of white rice, 5 million meters of textiles, 4 million pairs of shoes, and 10,000 tons of aquatic products to relieve the unemployed in South Korea. The government of the Republic hopes and is prepared to raise all the homeless orphans wandering the streets of South Korea, as this is a national duty that must be fulfilled. The government of the Republic is willing to provide long-term scholarships of 1,000 won per month to 3,000 needy students already enrolled in and about to enter universities in South Korea. The Cabinet of the Republic has also instructed the Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, the Minister of Education and Culture, the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Women's League, and the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Youth League to take necessary specific measures regarding the relevant relief work.
    The decision stated that under the dark rule of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea for thirteen years, industry has been completely bankrupt, agriculture has been abandoned, the number of unemployed and underemployed has reached 3.8 million, and hundreds of thousands of orphans are wandering the streets. The South Korean authorities have not taken any relief measures. Many students in South Korea are also in dire straits due to their inability to pay exorbitant tuition fees.
    The decision stated that the working people of North Korea have restored the war-torn national economy in a very short period of time. Last year, the total industrial output value reached 2.8 times that of the pre-war period. North Korea has changed from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area. Wages have been raised and prices have been lowered many times since the war, and the people's lives are improving day by day. All the people of North Korea can never forget the plight of the people of South Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Mun Jae-ju, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Korean Embassy in China, held a reception in Beijing this afternoon to read out to Chinese and foreign journalists the decision of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the relief of unemployed people, wandering orphans, and needy students in South Korea who are groaning under the occupation of American imperialism.

　　基于骨肉之情  伸出援助之手
    朝鲜政府决救济南部苦难同胞
    据新华社平壤21日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁今天在金日成首相主持下举行了全体会议。会议作出救济南朝鲜失业者、流浪孤儿和处境困难的青年学生的决定。
    决定说，共和国内阁对于南朝鲜同胞的悲惨处境不能不关心，从朝鲜北部全体人民一致的同胞的感情出发，决定无偿地提供十五万石白米、五百万公尺纺织品、四百万双鞋子和一万吨水产品救济南朝鲜的失业者；共和国政府希望并且准备把在南朝鲜街道上流浪的无家可归的孤儿们全部养育起来，因为这是应尽的民族义务；共和国政府愿向已在南朝鲜各大学就学和将要进大学的处境困难的三千名学生长期供给他们每月一千元的奖学金。共和国内阁并且继续欢迎南朝鲜青年学生到朝鲜北部求学。共和国政府已经分别责成朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长、教育文化相、民主妇女同盟中央委员会委员长和民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长就有关的救济工作采取必要的具体措施。
    决定说，南朝鲜十三年来在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的黑暗统治下，工业完全破产，农业荒废，失业者和半失业者达到三百八十万人，有数十万孤儿流浪街头，南朝鲜当局没有采取任何救济措施。南朝鲜的许多青年学生也由于缴不起过重的学费处于很困难的境地。
    决定说，朝鲜北部的劳动人民在很短的时期内恢复了遭到战争破坏的人民经济，去年的工业总产值已经达到战前的二·八倍，朝鲜北部由缺粮区变为余粮区，战后多次提高工资和降低物价，人民的生活日益改善，朝鲜北部全体人民对南朝鲜人民的悲惨处境时刻不能忘怀。
    新华社21日讯  朝鲜驻中国大使馆临时代办文在洙今天下午在北京举行招待会，向中外记者宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁关于救济在美帝国主义强占下呻吟的南朝鲜失业者、流浪孤儿和处境困难的青年学生的决定。
