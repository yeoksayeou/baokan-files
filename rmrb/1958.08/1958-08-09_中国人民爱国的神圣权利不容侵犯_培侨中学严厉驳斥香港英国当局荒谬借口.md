Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 8th: Pui Kiu Middle School in Hong Kong issued a statement on the 7th, pointing out that the "press release" issued by the Hong Kong British authorities regarding the forced departure of Pui Kiu Middle School Principal Tu Bokui from Hong Kong was an absurd press release.

The Hong Kong British Information Services Department issued a "press release" on the evening of the 6th to defend the Hong Kong authorities' use of force to compel Du Bokui to leave Hong Kong. The excuses listed in the press release were: that some "books on the theory of special political dogmas, etc." were found in the library of Pui Kiu Middle School; that meetings were held with teachers and students from other schools participating; and that "some unregistered teachers were hired without prior approval of their permission to teach."

The statement from Pui Kiu Middle School said: On April 18th of this year, Luo Zongxiong, head of the Hong Kong District of the Hong Kong British Education Department's Inspectorate, and Qian Qinglian, a special inspector, and four others came to the school to conduct an academic inspection. They inspected all the books in the school one by one and found nineteen books, including Chen Jiageng's "Nanyang Reminiscences," Volumes 1-4 of "Red Flag Fluttering," Volume 4 of "Basic Problems of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," "New Women of New China," "Teaching Syllabus for Modern World History in Senior High Schools," "A Short History of International Relations in the Last Thirty Years," "The Great Emancipation of Chinese Women," "The Chinese Communist Party and the Land Revolution," "Reader of the Current International Situation," "Ten Lectures on the World Situation," "Anti-American Aggression Study Manual"; and from the books donated to the school library by students and parents, books such as "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists" and "Making Communist Morality a Regular Practice." We do not understand the strange definition of the so-called "theory of special political dogma" referred to in this press release. The school supervisor already pointed out in a speech to the Hong Kong British Executive Council on August 5th: "We believe that the library's collection is for teachers and students to use for research, so the scope can be wider." Moreover, these books are openly sold in Hong Kong bookstores. Why insist that possessing these books constitutes a violation of the law? This extraordinary "inspection" has shown that the Education Department is deliberately looking for any excuse to persecute our school. As expected, Mao Qin, the acting Secretary of Education of Hong Kong British, subsequently used this excuse to make many demands on our school supervisor, guaranteeing that so-called "political activities" would not be carried out, that "political documents" would not be kept, that no teachers or students from other schools would be allowed to come to the Pui Kiu school building, and that no meetings would be allowed, etc.

The statement pointed out: The Hong Kong Education Department's requests for us to make these guarantees are unreasonable. To give an example, an outside school teacher is "not allowed to come to the Pui Kiu school building for any purpose whatsoever without the prior written approval of the Education Department." If we made this guarantee, then many of our teachers' wives or husbands who teach at other schools would have to obtain the Education Department's prior written approval to visit their relatives at Pui Kiu. What an absurd request! We are teaching at Pui Kiu Middle School and have not committed any crimes. Why should we guarantee that we will not recognize our relatives? This is the height of absurdity. For example, the Hong Kong British Education Department wants us to guarantee that any kind of meeting held outside of normal school hours must be reported fourteen days in advance and approved in writing by the Education Department. If we made this guarantee, we would not be able to carry out any educational work at all. Even teachers who discuss teaching issues would be considered to be "breaking the law," unless they foresee such and such problems in teaching fourteen days in advance and await the written approval of the Education Department. What strange logic! The Hong Kong Education Department's unreasonable "accusations" and absurd demands are of course unacceptable to us. We still wrote to Mr. Mao Qin based on reason and requested him to meet with us so that we could explain clearly. But this legitimate request was rejected.

The statement also said: The press release also mentioned the so-called "hiring of unregistered teachers." In fact, this is the case of unreasonably rejecting the registration of our three math, physics, and chemistry teachers. In September of last year, one of our chemistry teachers was forced to leave due to being denied registration; in November, two registered teachers had their registration revoked. Because we had difficulty hiring math, physics, and chemistry teachers, we explained the situation to officials at the Education Department's registration office and were allowed to let them teach temporarily. Subsequently, these two teachers also completed their registration procedures before classes started in September. In November, midway through the semester, the Education Department unexpectedly went back on its word and revoked their registration. How then can there be "hiring of unregistered teachers without prior permission"? The Hong Kong Education Department allows many teachers from Chiang Kai-shek's group's schools to come to Hong Kong from Taiwan to teach, but unreasonably rejects the registration of university graduates from mainland China, which is outrageous.

The statement concluded: Our school has been operating in Hong Kong for twelve years and has cultivated thousands of Hong Kong youth. Whether in teaching, sports, or artistic activities, our school has excellent results. Especially in moral education, we educate students to love their country and have a correct style, which is also praised by parents and people from all walks of life. Because our school is a patriotic school, the Hong Kong British authorities often persecute us unreasonably. This time, the Hong Kong authorities' unreasonable forcing of Principal Du Bokui to leave the country is a continuation of the Hong Kong Education Department's unreasonable interference in the school's hanging of the national flag. This is a serious incident that violates the basic patriotic rights of Chinese people, and we express our most serious protest against it!

    中国人民爱国的神圣权利不容侵犯
    培侨中学严厉驳斥香港英国当局荒谬借口
    新华社香港8日电  香港培侨中学7日发表声明指出，香港英国当局就强迫培侨中学校长杜伯奎离开香港事件发表的“新闻公报”是一个荒谬的公报。
    香港英国新闻处6日晚发表了一个“新闻公报”，来为香港当局用武力强迫杜伯奎离开香港的事件进行辩护。这个公报所列举的借口是：在培侨中学图书馆搜到一些“有关特殊的政治教条的理论等的书籍”；举行有其他学校的教师和学生参加的会议和“聘请了一些未注册教师，而事前并未获核准他们任教的许可”。
    培侨中学的声明说：今年4月18日，香港英国教育司署视学处香港区负责人罗宗熊及特别视学人员钱清廉等共六人来校查学，对学校的全部图书逐本检查，检出书籍十九本，包括陈嘉庚著的“南侨回忆录”、“红旗飘飘”一至四集、“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论基本问题”第四分册、“新中国的新妇女”、“高级中学世界近代史教学大纲”、“近三十年国际关系小史”、“中国妇女大翻身”、“中国共产党与土地革命”、“国际现势读本”、“世界现势十讲”、“反美侵略学习手册”；以及从学生与家长赠送本校图书馆的图书中检出“论共产党员修养”和“把共产主义道德经常化起来”等书籍。我们不明白这个公报所指的所谓“特殊的政治教条的理论”的奇怪定义。本校监督8月5日在香港英国行政局发言中已经指出：“我们认为图书馆的藏书是供给教师和学生作研究之用，因此范围可以广泛一些”。而且这些书籍都是在香港的书店里公开出售的，为何硬指自有这些书籍便算犯法？这一次异于平常的“视学”，已显示教育司蓄意找寻任何一种借口，迫害本校。果然，香港英国署理教育司毛勤随后就用此借口向本校监督提出许多要求，保证不得进行所谓“政治活动”，不得藏有“政治性文件”，任何外校师生不准到培侨校舍，不准开任何会议等等。
    声明指出：香港教育司要求我们作这些保证都是无理的。举一个例说说，一个外校教师，“未得教育司事前书面批准，不论任何目的，都一律不准到培侨校舍”。假如我们作了这个保证，那么我校许多教师的在外校教书的妻子或丈夫，要到培侨来探望他们的亲人，便必须获得教育司的事先的书面批准了，这是多么荒谬的要求！我们在培侨中学教书，并没有犯什么罪，为什么要我们保证六亲不认？这可谓荒谬到极顶了。又如，香港英国教育司要我们保证，在学校正常上课时间以外，举行任何种的会议，都要在十四天前呈报，并得教育司的书面批准。假如我们作了这个保证，这我们根本不能进行任何教育工作。就连教师们因为教学上的问题，进行讨论，也算是“犯法”。除非他们在十四天前预知教学上会出现这样那样的问题，及早听候教育司的书面批准。这是多么奇怪的逻辑！香港教育司这种无理的“指责”和荒谬的要求，当然是我们不能接受的。我们仍然根据情理写信给毛勤先生，要求他接见我们，让我们解释清楚。但这个正当的要求却受到拒绝。
    声明又说：这个公报还提到所谓“聘用未注册教师”问题，事实上就是无理拒绝我校三位数理化教师注册的事件。在去年9月间，我校一位化学教师因被拒绝注册，已被迫离职；11月，有两位已注册的教师又被撤销他们的注册。我们因聘请数理化教师困难，曾向教育司署注册处官员说明情况并已获准让他们暂时执教的。随后这两位教师也在9月开课前即已办好注册手续。至11月学期中途，教育司竟出尔反尔的又撤销他们的注册，这又何来“未先得许可，雇佣未经注册教师”？香港教育司署准许许多蒋介石集团的学校教师从台湾来港任教，而无理拒绝中国大陆的大学毕业生的注册，这是令人愤慨的。
    声明最后说：我们学校在香港开办了十二年，培养了上千的香港青少年。无论在教学上、体育和艺术活动上，我校都有优异的成绩，特别是在品德教育上，我们教育学生热爱祖国、作风正派，也是为家长以及社会人士所称道的。香港英国当局因为我校是一家爱国的学校，就经常对我们进行无理迫害。这次香港当局无理强迫杜伯奎校长出境事件，是香港教育司无理干涉学校悬挂国旗事件的继续，这是一项侵犯中国人爱国基本权利的严重事件，我们对此表示最严重的抗议！
