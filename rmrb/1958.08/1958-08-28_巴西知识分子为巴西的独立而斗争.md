　　Brazilian Intellectuals Fight for Brazil's Independence
　　Alberto Camo, Head of the Brazilian Radio and Television Artists Delegation
　　Since 1943, the Brazilian people have launched a fierce struggle against the control of Brazilian oil by American imperialism. A large number of intellectuals in our country have realized that they should stand on the side of the people.
　　Although the majority of our people are illiterate, their struggle for economic independence in the past thirteen years has greatly developed with the participation of a large number of intellectuals.
　　Brazil's economy is almost entirely dependent on foreign capital, mainly American capital. In the past twenty-eight years, British capital has been squeezed out, and American capital has occupied the main lifeline of Brazil's production.
　　American capital pays special attention to cultural life, which is of great significance for implementing economic domination, and they strictly control all areas of Brazilian cultural life.
　　The United States controls Brazil's publishing industry through its monopoly on the paper market. Brazil is still unable to be self-sufficient in paper, and the United States is Brazil's main paper monopolist. It determines publication prices and uses this to demand censorship of books to be published.
　　Radio and television in Brazil, which rely on commercial advertising for their livelihood, are actually under American control.
　　Brazil's film industry is severely affected and controlled by the United States. 80% of the films our people watch are American films that promote a decadent lifestyle and advocate war. The remaining 20% are domestic films or films from other countries, but their distribution is still controlled by the United States, because all the cinemas in Brazil are built by Americans.
　　The press, in general, especially in cities, is entirely in the hands of the United States. As the only paper monopoly and large advertising company, they can keep a newspaper running or force it to stop publishing.
　　Although the economic situation of cultural facilities is almost entirely dependent on the United States, those who want to freely develop their national culture are fighting against this control.
　　Now, despite the many difficulties, many writers are publishing books through small publishing houses in the form of joint ventures. Some who have their own funds publish at their own expense. For example, Huis Osni F. Doerte, who wrote a book of impressions after visiting the People's Republic of China. However, he found it difficult to publish it. As a result, he paid the publication fee himself and sold it with the help of Communist Party members. We can say publicly that this book and some other books about socialist countries have more readers than books published by large publishing houses.
　　With the support of progressive bourgeois figures in Brazil who want to expand their operations and get rid of American economic control, some radio and television stations have begun to emerge and develop their own programs. Some companies have voluntarily broadcast Brazilian programs.
　　Now, every week, we can hear Communist writer Dias Gomez's program about Brazil and his nationalism on Brazil's most important Rio de Janeiro National Radio. His "Everyone sings of their own land, and I will sing of my motherland" is the most successful program on Brazilian radio and television today.
　　In the film industry, producers and artists are working together to develop our own films. After a great struggle, they have obtained a law that cinemas must show at least one Brazilian film every other week.
　　Democratic, nationalist newspapers are selling well and spreading widely throughout Brazil today. These newspapers, under the guidance and leadership of nationalists, are in many cases cooperating with the Brazilian Communist Party.
　　Currently, a strong wave of nationalism has also been stirred up among our composers. Now the audience in Beijing can hear hymns to Brazil, songs about the Brazilian people and Brazil's rich resources from the programs of the Brazilian art troupe performing in New China.
　　All Brazilian intellectuals in cultural undertakings have participated in the anti-imperialist struggle. They have realized that they are fighting to build an independent and prosperous Brazil, to build a peace-loving Brazil that is willing to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries (regardless of the political system chosen by their people).

　　巴西知识分子为巴西的独立而斗争
    巴西广播、电视艺术家代表团团长  阿尔柏托·卡莫
    从1943年起，巴西人民展开了一个反对美国帝国主义控制巴西石油的激烈斗争。我国有一大部分知识分子都认识到他们应站在人民这一边。
    虽然我国大多数人民都是文盲，但是他们在近十三年来为经济独立而进行的斗争，在大批知识分子参加下已大大发展。
    巴西的经济几乎完全依赖于外国资本，主要是美国资本。在近二十八年中，英国资本已被排挤，美国资本已占据了巴西生产的主要命脉。
    美国资本对实行经济统治有重要意义的文化生活予以特殊的注意，它们严格地控制着巴西文化生活的各个领域。
    美国通过对纸张市场的垄断，控制着巴西的出版事业。巴西的纸目前仍不能自给自足，而美国是巴西最主要的纸张垄断者，它决定出版价格，并以此要求对将出版的书籍进行审查。
    在巴西依靠商业广告生活的电台和电视，实际上也都在美国的控制之下。
    巴西的电影事业受到美国严重的影响和控制。我国人民所看的电影中，80％都是宣扬腐朽的生活方式和鼓吹战争的美国片子。其余20％是本国影片或其他国家的影片，但是在分配上仍受到美国的控制。因为在巴西所有的电影院都是美国人建造的。
    新闻事业一般来说，特别在城市里，全部掌握在美国手中。作为唯一的纸张垄断企业和大广告公司，它们能使一种报纸继续办下去，也能迫使它停止出版。
    虽然文化设施的经济情况几乎完全取决于美国，但是那些想自由发展本国文化的人进行着反对这种控制的斗争。
    现在，尽管困难重重，很多作家通过小出版社合股的形式出版着书籍。有的自己具备资金的就自己出钱出版。例如，胡衣斯·奥斯尼·弗·道尔特，他访问人民中国后写了一本印象记。但是，他很难出版它。结果他自己付了出版费并在共产党员的帮助下销售出去了。我们能公开说，这本书和出版的其他一些有关社会主义国家的书籍比大出版社出版的书有更多的读者。
    在想扩大其经营并摆脱美国经济控制的巴西进步的资产阶级人士的支持下，有些电台和电视台已开始出现并发展着本国的节目。有一些企业已自愿播送巴西的节目。
    现在我们每星期都可在巴西最重要的里约热内卢国家电台中，听到共产党员作家狄阿斯高麦兹关于巴西和他民族主义的节目。他的“所有人都歌唱自己的土地，我也要歌颂我的祖国”，是今日在巴西电台、电视中最为成功的节目。
    在电影事业中，制片人和艺术家们共同在为发展我们自己的影片而斗争。他们经过了巨大的斗争，已取得了每隔一周电影院必须至少放映一部巴西影片的一项法律。
    民主、民族主义的报纸今日在巴西全国畅销，传播极广。这些在民族主义者指导和领导下的报纸，在很多情况下都是和巴西共产党人合作的。
    目前就在我们的作曲家中，也掀起了强烈的民族主义的浪潮。现在北京的观众们能从正在新中国进行演出的巴西艺术团的节目中，听到歌唱巴西的颂歌，歌唱巴西人民和巴西丰富资源的歌曲。
    所有文化事业中的巴西知识分子，都参加了反帝国主义的斗争。他们已认识到，他们是在为建立一个独立富强的巴西而斗争，是为建立一个愿和世界各国人民（不论其人民所选择的政治制度如何）和平共处的热爱和平的巴西而斗争。
