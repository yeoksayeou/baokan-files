　　Discussing the Performance of Quyi
　　Ma Yanxiang
From what I saw in the performances, most of the Quyi genres, whether in terms of content or music, have undergone significant reforms. Some Quyi melodies were originally rather lingering and melancholic, and were always thought to be only suitable for expressing sentimental stories like *Dream of the Red Chamber* and *Romance of the Western Chamber*. However, after the artists' careful research and bold reforms, they are now able to express the new people and new things in modern life with ease.

However, closely related to the reform of Quyi music is the issue of Quyi's performance methods.

Quyi primarily relies on storytelling and singing, with performance movements as supplementary. Some Quyi genres only have storytelling and singing without any performance movements, and they still remain a form of Quyi. However, the desire to add performance movements to the storytelling and singing to enhance the performance effect is a natural law of the development of Quyi art. Therefore, generally speaking, Quyi always has both storytelling and singing as well as performance. Some genres that only have storytelling without performance are also gradually developing in this direction. For example, Sichuan Qingyin, Zhuqin, Yangqin, Heye, Suzhou Pingtan, and Jiangxi Qingyin Dagu, which participated in this performance, were originally all performed while seated. Now they have all been changed to standing performances, or both seated and standing performances, which is a very good proof. This kind of reform makes the performance more lively and is something to be welcomed.

The current question is that the content of Quyi has undergone a fundamental change. How should we perform these new people and new things in the future? This performance provides us with two methods: one is to perform from life and from the characters. The actors only appropriately exaggerate the reality of life and create the image of the characters according to their personalities and ideological activities. Although performance techniques are also used on the stage, the audience does not feel that they are "performing." The actors have achieved the unity of content and performance. For example, Shanghai Pinghua's "Wang Chonglun" and Hebei Xihe Dagu's "Five Thousand and One" have reached this level. The other is to use some of the body movements and techniques that were absorbed from opera performances in the past traditional storytelling programs, but with little or almost no change, and directly apply them to the performance. The actors are telling and singing about new life and characters, but the techniques they use to express these new life and characters are the old set. The actors are working hard to "perform," but their performance is not combined with the content. Therefore, even if they sing melodiously, it is difficult to resonate with the audience.

From the performances in this event, it seems that the latter method is dominant. It is said that doing so is to inherit the performance tradition of Quyi art. I think this is a question worth raising for everyone to study.

There is no objection to borrowing some performance methods from operas that have already achieved high artistic achievements when performing traditional programs. It is also necessary. But we must see that the performance movements of opera are produced from a certain social life. Through the rich processing and creation of countless outstanding artists, it has achieved harmony and unity between content and form in expressing historical life and historical figures. Today, our society has changed, and the old form obviously cannot fully express the new content. This is a contradiction. This contradiction currently exists in some opera genres and needs to be further explored to find a solution. Quyi should be relatively easy to solve in this regard. The problem may lie in how to understand inheriting artistic traditions and how to become familiar with the new life and new people.

I sincerely hope that all Quyi artists, like they have already done with Quyi music, can break the old conventions and boldly innovate in Quyi performance, so that Quyi art can become more perfect in expressing the content and form of modern life.

　　谈谈曲艺的表演问题
　　马彦祥
    从会演中所看到的一些节目来说，大多数的曲种，无论在内容方面、音乐方面，都有了很大的改革。有些曲种的曲调原来比较缠绵幽怨，一向被人们认为只宜于表现红楼、西厢这一类抒情故事的，经过艺人们精心研究，大胆改革后，居然也能够胜任愉快地来表现现代生活中的新人新事了。
    但和曲艺音乐的改革有密切联系的，还有曲艺的表演方法问题。
    曲艺以说唱为主，表演动作为辅。有些曲种只有说唱而无表演动作，仍不失其为曲艺形式。但歌咏之不足，进而要求于说唱之外增加些表演动作来加强演出效果，也是曲艺艺术发展的自然规律。所以一般地说，曲艺总是不仅有说唱而且有表演的，有些只有说而无表演的也是逐渐在向这个方向发展的。例如这次参加会演的四川清音、竹琴、扬琴、荷叶、苏州弹词、江西清音大鼓等，原来都是坐唱的，现在都改为站唱，或既有坐唱又有站唱，就是一个很好的证明。这种改革使节目的演出更生动活泼，也是应该欢迎的。
    现在的问题是曲艺内容已经起了根本变化，以后，如何来表演这些新人新事。这次会演给我们提供了两种方法：一种是从生活出发、从人物出发来进行表演，演员只是把生活的真实适当的加以艺术的夸张，依照人物的性格和思想活动来创造人物的形象；在舞台上虽也运用了表演的技巧，但给观众的印象却不是在“表演”，演员做到了内容和表演的统一；例如上海评话的“王崇伦”、河北西河大鼓的“五千一”，都是达到了这个水平的。另一种是运用了过去说唱传统节目时从戏曲表演中吸取来的一些身段动作，但很少变化或几乎原封不动地搬来进行表演，演员说唱的是新的生活和人物，但他用来表现这些新生活新人物的技巧却是旧的一套；演员努力地在“表演”，但他的表演和内容是不结合的，因此，即使唱得悦耳动听，却很难引起观众的共鸣。
    这两种方法，从会演中所演出的一些节目来看，似乎后者是占优势的；据说这样做才算是继承了曲艺艺术的表演传统。我认为这是一个值得提出来供大家研究的问题。
    演唱传统节目，借助于已有高度艺术成就的戏曲的一些表演方法，是无可非议的，也是必要的。但我们必须看到，戏曲的表演动作是从一定的社会生活里产生的，通过无数优秀艺人的丰富加工和创造，它在表现历史生活和历史人物的要求上，已经做到了内容和形式的和谐一致。今天我们的社会变了，旧形式显然不能完全表现新内容，这是一个矛盾。这个矛盾目前正也在戏曲的某些剧种中存在着，有待于进一步探求解决的途径。曲艺在这方面应该是比较容易解决的，问题恐怕是在如何理解继承艺术传统，和如何熟悉新的生活、新的人物。
    我衷心地希望，所有曲艺艺术家们像他们对于曲艺音乐已经做过的那样，在曲艺表演方面也能打破陈规，大胆革新，使曲艺艺术在表现现代生活的内容和形式上更加趋于完美。
