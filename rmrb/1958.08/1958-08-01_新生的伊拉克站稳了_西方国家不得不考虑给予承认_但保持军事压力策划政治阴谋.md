Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: On July 30th, the three Muslim countries participating in the Baghdad Military Pact—Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey—and West Germany formally recognized the government of the Republic of Iraq. On July 31st, Italy and Japan also announced their recognition of the Iraqi government. At the same time, news frequently came from Washington and London that the governments of these two countries were considering the issue of recognizing the Republic of Iraq government. These signs indicate that the newborn republic, thanks to the support of people around the world, has stood firm, thwarting the plans and conspiracies of US-British imperialists to strangle its young life by force.

The rapid domestic stabilization after the Iraqi revolution, the consecutive recognition of the republic by more than twenty countries, and the enthusiastic support of people around the world have forced the West to reconsider its policies toward Iraq. According to Reuters, quoting Washington diplomatic officials, it appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Western countries not to recognize this government, because "the new government has been able to fully control the situation." London's "News Chronicle" said, "Nuri al-Said's faction is either dead or imprisoned. The old days can never return. The sooner we realize this, the better."

Reports say that the Baghdad Pact London meeting specifically discussed the issue of dealing with the Iraqi government and reached a "understanding". The recognition by Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey this time was obviously discussed at the meeting.

However, these countries' change in attitude towards Iraq has not diminished their hostility towards the Iraqi revolution in the slightest. Just as Turkey announced its recognition of Iraq, Turkish troops were still massing on the Iraqi border, and a large number of American troops were stationed in its territory adjacent to Syria. Its reservists are in a state of emergency mobilization.

According to US and British press reports, the West is adopting new strategies towards Iraq while continuing to maintain strong military pressure. Its purpose is to further engage in political conspiracies to facilitate imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

    新生的伊拉克站稳了
    西方国家不得不考虑给予承认  但保持军事压力策划政治阴谋
    新华社31日讯　7月30日，参加巴格达军事集团的三个穆斯林国家——巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其和西德等国正式承认了伊拉克共和国政府。7月31日，意大利和日本又宣布承认伊拉克政府。同时，从华盛顿和伦敦也频频传出消息说，这两个国家的政府在考虑承认伊拉克共和国政府的问题。这些迹象表明了，新生的共和国由于它得到全世界人民的支持，已经站立住了，它挫败了美英帝国主义者妄想用武力来扼杀它的年轻生命的计划和阴谋。
    伊拉克革命后国内迅速稳定，二十多个国家接连承认了这个共和国，以及全世界人民的热烈支持，迫使西方不得不重新考虑它们对伊拉克的政策。据路透社引用华盛顿外交官员的话说，看来，西方国家想不承认这个政府已经越来越困难了，因为“新政府已经能够完全控制住局面”。伦敦的“新闻纪事报”说，“努里·赛义德派死的死了，关的关了，旧的日子不可能再复返，我们越早认识到这一点越好。”
    消息说，巴格达条约伦敦会议曾专门讨论了对待伊拉克政府的问题，并且取得了“谅解”。这次巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其三个国家的承认显然是会议曾经商量过的。
    但是，这些国家对伊拉克态度的改变丝毫也没有减少它们对伊拉克革命的仇视。就在土耳其宣布承认伊拉克的时候，土耳其军队还在伊拉克边境集结，它的邻近叙利亚的领土上正驻屯着大批的美国军队。它的后备军人处于紧急动员的状态中。
    据美英报刊消息透露，西方在继续保持强大军事压力下对伊拉克采取新的策略，其目的在进一步从事政治阴谋，以便利于帝国主义对中东的侵略活动。
