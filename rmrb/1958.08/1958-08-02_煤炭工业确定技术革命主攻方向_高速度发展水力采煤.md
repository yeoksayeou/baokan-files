Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, August 1st: The Ministry of Coal Industry convened a National Coal Technology Revolution Conference in Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan, from July 25th to 31st. In accordance with the spirit of the General Line, the conference determined the main direction of technological development in the coal industry: to develop the world's advanced mining technology—hydraulic mining—at the highest speed.

Since the beginning of this year, after the rectification movement, a new situation of double leap forward has emerged in production and construction in coal mines across the country. In terms of capital construction, the scale of new well construction this year is about twice as large as the scale of new well construction during the First Five-Year Plan period.

According to the new situation of great development in China's coal industry and the current production situation, the conference believes that the main requirements of the technological revolution in the coal industry are to strive to simplify the production process, liberate heavy physical labor, reduce or control natural disasters, improve production efficiency, and reduce costs. From the perspective of the world's advanced science and technology level in the coal industry, the main method suitable for the above requirements is hydraulic mining. The representatives cited the fact that seventeen hydraulic mining areas and one hydraulic mining well have been built in various places in China in the past two years, proving that hydraulic mining has more advantages than mechanized mining: less investment, faster construction, higher production efficiency, lower cost, less wood consumption, simpler production equipment, simpler production process, better working conditions, and safer production.

The conference believes that although hydraulic mining is a new technology, some difficulties may be encountered in its implementation. However, the experience of Kailuan, Jiawang, and other coal mines proves that as long as politics takes command, the masses are relied upon and mobilized, and one dares to think and act, not only can the difficulties encountered in the implementation be completely resolved, but also new developments can be made in technology. Kailuan Coal Mine's hydraulic mining has not only developed from mining medium-thick coal seams to thin coal seams and thick coal seams, but also can manufacture the main tools for hydraulic mining by itself. Recently, technicians from the Tangshan Coal Research Institute and workers from the Kailuan Linxi Machine Repair Factory closely cooperated to manufacture a coal-water pump with a head of 300 meters.

Through reports, experience introductions, exhibitions, and on-site visits, the conference criticized the conservative ideas that did not pay enough attention to hydraulic mining, as well as the ideas that mystified hydraulic mining. In the spirit of going all out and aiming high, the representatives formulated and revised plans for promoting hydraulic mining. Representatives from Kailuan, Jiawang, Fuxin, Fengfeng, Pingxiang and other coal mines expressed that they would basically or completely adopt hydraulic mining in the entire mining area within the next two years.

In order to solve the problem of mechanical and electrical equipment for hydraulic mining, representatives from various places unanimously proposed to be "self-reliant" and immediately start building small steel plants, cement plants, coking plants, and tar plants in the shortest possible time by adopting methods from small to large and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and transform all existing repair shops in the mining area into manufacturing plants to manufacture the equipment needed by themselves.

    煤炭工业确定技术革命主攻方向
    高速度发展水力采煤
    新华社唐山1日电　煤炭工业部7月25日到31日在唐山开滦煤矿召开了全国煤炭技术革命会议。会议根据总路线的精神，确定了煤炭工业技术发展的主要方向：以最高的速度发展世界先进采煤技术——水力采煤。
    今年以来，全国各地煤矿经过整风运动，生产与建设都出现了双跃进的新局面。在基本建设方面，今年建井规模，比第一个五年计划期间建设新井规模约大一倍。
    根据我国煤炭工业大发展的新形势和目前生产的状况，会议认为煤炭工业技术革命的主要要求，是力争简化生产过程，解放笨重体力劳动，减少或制服自然灾害，提高生产效率和降低成本。从目前世界上煤炭工业先进科学技术水平看来，适合于上述要求的，主要是水力采煤。代表们列举我国两年来已在各地建成的十七个水力采煤区和一个水力采煤矿井的事实，证明水力采煤比机械化采煤有更多的优点：投资少，建设快，生产效率高，成本低，坑木消耗少，生产设备简单，生产工序单一，劳动条件最好，生产最安全。
    会议认为，水力采煤虽然是一种新技术，在推行中可能会遇到一些困难，但是从开滦、贾汪等地煤矿推行的经验证明，只要政治挂帅、依靠和发动群众，敢想敢干，不仅能完全解决在推行中所碰到的困难，而且在技术上也有新的发展。开滦煤矿的水力采煤不仅已由开采中厚煤层发展到薄煤层和厚煤层，而且能够自己制造水力采煤的主要工具。最近，唐山煤炭科学研究院技术人员同开滦林西机修厂的工人密切合作，制成了一台三百公尺扬程的煤水泵。
    会议通过报告、经验介绍、展览会和现场参观，批判了对于水力采煤不够重视的保守思想，以及把水力采煤神秘化的思想。代表们本着鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，纷纷制定和修改了推行水力采煤的计划。开滦、贾汪、阜新、峰峰、萍乡等煤矿的代表，表示今明两年内在全矿区基本上或全部采用水力采煤。
    为了解决水力采煤的机电设备问题，各地代表一致提出要当“自力更生派”，在最短时间内，采取由小到大、土洋结合的办法，立即着手兴建小型钢铁厂、水泥厂、炼焦厂、焦油厂，并且将现有矿区的修理厂全部改造为制造厂，自己制造所需要的设备。
