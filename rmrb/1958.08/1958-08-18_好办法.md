　　Good Method
　　Taking the capitalist road? Or taking the socialist road? The struggle between the two roads in the countryside cannot achieve a final and complete victory in one movement, and it will continue for a considerable period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly educate the peasants in socialism and guide them to resolutely take the socialist road. The rectification exhibition halls widely held in the vast rural areas of Shandong are a good way to conduct socialist education for peasants on a regular basis.
　　This method is good because it presents the facts and lets the facts participate in the great debate, and the facts are the most convincing and cannot be refuted by anyone.
　　Also, because the exhibits in the exhibition hall are all real things from the local area and are familiar to the local farmers, and the parties involved are telling their personal experiences, this is both vivid and specific, which makes it easier for the local farmers to accept, and makes those who have forgotten their roots and those who do not appreciate their blessings wake up.
　　The exhibition hall also displays the prospects for a happy socialist life, which makes the peasants, after abandoning the capitalist road, more energetic and redouble their efforts to realize the beautiful socialist life of the future.
　　Let the vast rural areas set up rectification exhibition halls like Shandong!

### 好办法

　　好办法
    走资本主义道路？还是走社会主义道路？在农村的两条道路的斗争，不是在一次运动中就可以取得最终的、彻底的胜利的，在相当长的时间内还要继续进行下去。因此就需要经常不断地对农民进行社会主义教育，引导农民坚决走社会主义的道路。山东广大农村普遍举办的整风展览馆，就是对农民经常进行社会主义教育的好办法。
    这个办法所以好，就是因为它摆出了事实，让事实参加了大辩论，而事实是最有说服力的，任何人也驳不倒。
    又因为展览馆的展品都是当地的真实事物，都是当地农民所熟悉的，又有当事人现身说法，这真是既生动又具体，这就更容易为当地农民所接受，使那些忘了本的和身在福中不知福的人猛醒。
    展览馆还展出了社会主义幸福生活的远景，这就使农民在摒弃资本主义道路之后，更加鼓足干劲，为实现未来的社会主义的美满生活而加倍努力。
    让广大农村都像山东一样办起整风展览馆来！
