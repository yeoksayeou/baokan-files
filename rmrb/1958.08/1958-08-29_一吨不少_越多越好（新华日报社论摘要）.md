Not One Ton Less, The More The Better
(Xinhua Daily Editorial Abstract)

To take all effective measures to ensure the complete fulfillment and overfulfillment of this year's steel production task in the province is a glorious strategic task placed before the entire Party and the people of the province.

Is it possible that this year's steel production task in the province cannot be fully completed? No, absolutely not. Not even a single ton less of steel can be produced this year; one ton less would be a failure. We must recognize that fulfilling this task has not only significant economic implications but also significant political implications. A resolute and unwavering attitude must be adopted towards this issue; otherwise, we will commit serious political errors.

This year is the first year of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The Party teaches us that the first year sets the tone for the next three years; therefore, this year is a decisive year. The complete fulfillment of this year's steel production task will not only lay the foundation for an even greater leap forward in the province's steel industry next year but will also create conditions for an even greater leap forward in the entire industry and agriculture next year.

We must see that in the large-scale development of the steel industry, the struggle between the two lines of "more, faster, better, and more economical" versus "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" is very sharp. In the industrial field, just as in the agricultural field, there is a struggle between the promoting faction and the inhibiting faction, and there are also doubters and accountants. Although we have achieved great victories in our struggle with them, the struggle is not over. In the large-scale development of the steel industry, we must, like in agricultural production, force them to surrender to the general line with the achievements of the great leap forward. Today, we are fully equipped to fulfill and overfulfill this year's steel production task. In the struggle between the two lines in the steel industry, the socialist line will inevitably achieve complete victory. The fate of those accountants and doubters is sure to be bankruptcy. However, if we cannot fully fulfill and overfulfill this year's steel production task, then the accountants and doubters may seize upon a weakness; they will attack one point and ignore the rest. Therefore, whether or not we can fully and overfulfill this year's steel production task is a major issue related to the political struggle between the two lines. We must do everything possible to prove the correctness of the Party's general line for socialist construction and safeguard the Party's general line for socialist construction with practical actions of fulfilling and overfulfilling the steel production task, thereby thoroughly defeating all inhibiting, doubting, and accounting factions.

The comprehensive leap forward in our country's agriculture and industry, and the comprehensive leap forward in the entire national economy, will inevitably and already have had a profound impact internationally, greatly enhancing the strength of defending world peace and the socialist camp, and powerfully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Therefore, we must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the steel production tasks assigned by the state. Faced with such a serious task, can we waver or hesitate? No, absolutely not.

Of course, completing and overfulfilling this year's steel production task is an arduous battle, a fierce battle. But where there are difficulties, there are solutions. As long as the entire Party is mobilized, the masses are fully mobilized, politics is put in command, and meticulous and concrete organizational work is carried out diligently, there are no insurmountable difficulties. We have all the necessary favorable conditions to overcome all difficulties. The soaring enthusiasm of the people of the province is the most valuable condition. With enthusiasm, we can create all miracles. We already have successful iron smelting experience, which can quickly spread everywhere; as long as technology is widely taught and cutting-edge experience is vigorously promoted, all native blast furnaces can operate normally.

　　一吨不少　越多越好
　　（新华日报社论摘要）
    采取一切有效措施，确保本省今年钢铁生产任务的全部完成和超额完成，这是摆在全党和全省人民面前的光荣的战略任务。
    今年全省钢铁生产任务是不是可以不全部完成呢？不能，绝对不能。今年钢铁的产量连一吨也不能少，少了一吨就是失败。我们必须认识到：完成这一任务，不仅有重大的经济意义，而且还有重大的政治意义。对待这一问题必须采取坚决的、毫不动摇的态度；否则，我们将会犯严重的政治错误。
    今年是工农业生产大跃进的第一年。党教导我们：三年看头年，因此，今年是决定性的一年。今年钢铁生产任务的全部完成，将不仅为本省明年度钢铁工业的更大跃进打下基础，而且还将为明年整个工业和农业的更大跃进创造条件。
    我们必须看到，在大办钢铁工业中，多快好省和少慢差费这两条路线的斗争是十分尖锐的。在工业方面也和农业方面一样，同样有着促进派和促退派之间的斗争，同样有怀疑派和算账派的存在。我们同他们之间的斗争虽然已经取得了很大的胜利，但是斗争并未结束。在大办钢铁工业方面，我们必须像农业生产一样，用大跃进的成绩来逼着他们向总路线投降。今天，我们完成和超额完成今年钢铁生产任务的条件是完全具备的。在钢铁工业方面的两条路线的斗争中，社会主义的路线必然会取得完全的胜利。那些算账派和怀疑派的命运肯定是会破产的。可是，如果我们不能全部完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产任务，那么，就有可能被算账派、怀疑派抓到一条辫子；他们就会攻其一点，不及其余。因此，能否全部和超额完成今年钢铁生产任务，这是关系到两条路线的政治斗争的大事。我们必须千方百计地以完成和超额完成钢铁生产任务的实际行动来证明党的社会主义建设总路线的正确性，维护党的社会主义建设的总路线，从而彻底击败一切促退派、怀疑派、算账派。
    我国农业、工业的全面跃进，整个国民经济的全面跃进，这就必然会、而且已经在国际上发生了极其深远的影响，大大地增强了保卫世界和平和社会主义阵营的力量，有力地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。因此，我们必须保证完成和超额完成国家分配的钢铁生产任务。在如此严重的任务面前，难道我们可以动摇、犹豫吗？不能，绝对不能。
    当然，完成和超额完成今年钢铁生产的任务，是一场苦战，一场恶战。但是有困难就会有办法。只要全党动员起来，充分发动群众，坚持政治挂帅，认真地进行细致的具体的组织工作，就没有不可克服的困难。我们完全具有充分的有利条件可以战胜一切困难。全省人民的冲天干劲是最宝贵的条件。有了干劲，就能创造出一切奇迹。我们已经有了成功的炼铁经验，可以迅速遍地开花；只要广泛传授技术，大力推广尖端经验，所有的土高炉就完全可以正常生产。
