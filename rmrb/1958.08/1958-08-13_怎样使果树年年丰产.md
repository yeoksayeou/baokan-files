From the experience of many advanced orchards, we can see that to achieve bumper fruit harvests every year and eliminate the phenomenon of alternate-year bearing, comprehensive technical measures must be adopted. Now I will introduce the main experiences of advanced agricultural cooperatives and experimental stations in North China in achieving high fruit yields below for reference.

I. Increase Fertilizer Application, Apply Topdressing in Stages: In high-yield orchards, in addition to applying a large amount of base fertilizer in conjunction with autumn plowing, they also apply topdressing fertilizers in stages during the fruit growth period. The fertilization period is mostly before flowering, after fruit setting, and before harvest, with a total of three to five topdressings. Topdressing before flowering can meet the nutrient needs of fruit trees for spring branch and leaf growth; apple, pear, and other fruit trees begin flower bud differentiation from June to August, so topdressing after fruit setting (June) to before harvest not only promotes fruit growth and increases the current year's yield, but also guarantees the formation of flower buds for the next year's fruiting.

II. Timely Irrigation, Pay Attention to Moisture Retention: If the soil moisture is insufficient, even if more fertilizer is applied, it cannot be used by the fruit trees, so ensuring that fruit trees have sufficient moisture during the growing period is of great significance. North China is dry in spring, so spring irrigation and moisture retention work is especially important. In recent years, North China and southern Liaoning have strengthened early spring fertilizer and water management for fruit trees, which has been very effective in increasing fruit production. Advanced orchards also pay attention to fruit tree moisture retention. They plow the soil under and between the trees in spring and winter, remove the surface-growing fibrous roots, so that the roots penetrate deep into the soil, expand the absorption area, and make the soil loose, reducing soil moisture evaporation; some orchards cover the ground under the trees with straw and pond mud, which also has a significant effect on moisture retention.

III. Rational Pruning: The purpose of pruning is to control the growth and fruiting of fruit trees, so it is an important link in increasing fruit production and eliminating alternate-year bearing. Advanced orchards determine pruning techniques based on variety characteristics, tree age, and development conditions. For example, the 'Hongyu' apple variety has strong branching ability, with long and numerous branches, so they prune away more branches to avoid overcrowding the tree; for the 'Qingxiangjiao' variety, which has weak branching ability and many short fruit branches, they shorten the branches more to promote the growth of more branches and expand the fruiting area. Young fruit trees should be pruned lightly, mainly by thinning out excess branches; for mature trees in the full fruiting period, pruning should be mainly by shortening perennial branches, combined with thinning out overly dense fruit branches; this pruning not only makes the tree shape develop evenly and improves fruit quality, but also extends the fruit tree's fruiting years. For fruit trees with declining yields and aging, renewal pruning is carried out, which mainly involves shortening pruning and thinning out some aging branches to promote the growth of new branches; a large amount of fertilizer must be applied one or two years before renewal pruning in order to achieve the desired effect.

IV. Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Diseases and Insect Pests: Advanced orchards all attach importance to the prevention and control of diseases and pests. After the leaves fall in winter, they clean up the withered grass and fallen leaves in the orchard to eliminate latent diseases and insects. In early spring, before the fruit trees sprout, they scrape off the old bark of the fruit trees to eliminate overwintering diseases and insects, which greatly controls pests.

### 怎样使果树年年丰产

　　怎样使果树年年丰产
    从许多先进的果园的经验里，可以看到要使果树年年丰产和消灭隔年结果现象，就必须采取综合性的技术措施。现在我把华北地区的先进农业社和试验场站取得果树丰产的主要经验介绍在下面，以供各地参考。
    一、增施肥料，分期追肥：在高产的果园里除了结合秋耕施入大量的基肥外，他们还在树果生长期间分期施入追肥。施肥的时期多在开花前、坐果后至采收前，共施追肥三至五次。开花前追肥可以满足春季果树枝叶生长，和果树所需要的养分；苹果梨等果树在6—8月开始花芽分化，因此在坐果后（6月）至采收前施追肥不但能促进果实增长，提高当年的产量，并且可以保证形成第二年结果用的花芽。
    二、及时灌溉，注意保墒：如果土壤水分不足，虽多施肥料也不能为果树所利用，因此保证果树在生长期间有充足的水分有很大的意义。华北春季干旱，所以春季灌水保墒工作尤其重要，华北及辽南地区近年来加强了果树早春肥水工作，在果树增产上成效显著。先进果园对果树保墒工作也很注意，他们在春冬翻耕树下和树间的土壤，除去地表生长的须根，使根深入土内，扩大吸收面积，并使土壤松软，减少土壤水分蒸发；有的果园在树下复盖藁草、塘泥，对保墒也有显著的作用。
    三、合理修剪：修剪的目的是控制果树的生长和结果，因此是果树增产和消灭隔年结果的重要环节之一。先进的果园都根据品种特性、树龄及发育情况来确定修剪技术。例如苹果红玉品种分枝力强，枝条长而多，他们就多疏去枝条，以免树势密闭；对分枝力弱，短果枝多的青香蕉品种，就多短截枝条，促使多发生枝条，扩大结果面积。幼龄的果树注意轻剪，以疏剪多余的枝条为主；入盛果期大树的修剪，以短截多年生枝为主，结合疏剪过密果枝；这样修剪，不但使树形发展均匀和改进了果实的品质，还延长了果树结果年限。对产量下降衰老的果树进行更新修剪，即以短截修剪为主并疏去一部分衰老的枝条，促使发生新的枝条；更新修剪前一两年必须施入大量的肥料，这样才能收到预期的效果。
    四、全面防治病虫害：先进的果园莫不重视防治病虫的工作。他们在冬季落叶后清理果园的枯草落叶，消灭潜伏的病虫。在早春果树发芽前刮去果树老皮，消灭越冬的病虫，在很大程度上控制了虫害。
