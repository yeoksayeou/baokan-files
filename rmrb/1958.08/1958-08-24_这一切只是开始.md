　　All This is Just the Beginning
　　Yu Liansheng, Secretary of the Yongfengtun Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    We, the people of Yongfengtun in Changping District, Beijing, are creating a new life according to our communist ideals. In just six months, our township has undergone tremendous changes.

    In winter, we didn't just sit by our warm brick beds waiting for a bountiful year. The Party led us in a vigorous campaign to accumulate fertilizer and dig wells. It was in this intense production upsurge that we launched health publicity.

  "Sweeping makes the dung heap long," "Eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, increase production in the fields, and prolong life." It was a good thing, and once it was called for, we got to work. Every morning, people swept the streets and carried water in groups, and the sides of the streets were whitewashed with lime. Good things are easy to get used to. How could you not sweep your yard every day? Public toilets also appeared for the first time in our villages, and every family's manure pit had a lid. Some streets even had spittoons.

    In the spring, we successfully completed the task of digging wells and accumulating fertilizer. We accumulated 20,000 catties of fertilizer per mu. We dug 1,304 wells. Faced with this unprecedented victory, we sang and danced. Many singing teams were formed at once: sister chorus teams, brother chorus teams, old man chorus teams, and even small-footed hero teams. Under the shade of the trees, old grandfathers held their grandchildren and sang together; during breaks from work, 75-year-old grandmothers wrote and performed their own songs and dances; old men never put down their clappers, and they could perform at any time. In the fields, there was a chorus of "Socialism is Good." New poems were written on the whitewashed walls: here it said, "Young men are really great, they don't stay in bed all day"; and there it said, "Our commune is praised by everyone, a flower in the southwest of Changping." The clubs that we had been thinking about for years were established, one in each village, with wind and string instruments, and everyone sat indoors. Once-a-year evening parties couldn't meet the demand, and even once a month was too little! There were literacy evening parties, celebration evening parties, and all kinds of get-togethers. Self-arranged and self-performed, saving money and effort, and each one was more lively than the last. As soon as the lights were lit, people no longer groped around in the dark, but went to the club to sit, some reading books and others playing chess. All kinds of creations sprung up like mushrooms after rain, with a hundred flowers blooming. In this way, we welcomed the summer in songs of happiness.

    The bugle call of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution sounded. Some people created foot-operated waterwheels, and some created hand-cranked waterwheels. People's minds began to become active, but they immediately felt the difficulties. It was no good without culture! But in the past, the gates of regular schools were tightly closed to those who could not leave production, and young people were even more anxious. They had been out of school for several years. Was this the end? Socialism cannot do without culture. So, we vigorously launched literacy campaigns, finishing in 180 days. Within five days, we also founded four part-work, part-study agricultural middle schools for young farmers, one in each commune, with classes in the morning and labor in the afternoon, and free classes. Although three small houses were not enough, the learning was linked to practice. Young people who could not study for half a day could also attend the youth spare-time technical school, which had two classes a week. What if there were cadres from townships and communes and production activists with high levels of culture, rich political experience, and production experience, but lacking theory, and ordinary schools could not meet their needs? The general line requires us to dare to think and dare to do. Why can't we run a university?

    We did what we said we would do. What was originally planned to be done in three years was completed in less than a month. Our Red Flag University first offered two courses: one in Marxism-Leninism and one in the principles of agriculture. Who says our school isn't a university? Let's compare. The crops are the test papers. The children also have their own happy paradise. Every village has a nursery team. Mothers can work with peace of mind, and the children receive communist education. In this way, a relatively complete vocational and spare-time education system appeared in our township, forming the "two legs" of socialist education with regular schools. There is a library in every commune, and popular science education can be received everywhere.

    In the early years, there was drought if it didn't rain and flooding if it did. People went outside to escape famine in groups, working as miners and rickshaw pullers. Poor people couldn't take care of hygiene! The main street in front of the township government was a stinking ditch. What kind of dirty things were not dumped in it? The burden of suffering weighed heavily on people's shoulders. They couldn't even breathe, so how could they sing? Before liberation, in terms of culture, there was only one junior high school student in the whole township. That student later became a bad egg. Liberation brought us land reform, and we turned over economically. Cooperativization cut off the roots of poverty, and today we have truly begun a cultural turnaround.

    All this is just the beginning. Many good things have not yet spread throughout the township, and the things that have already been established have not yet been tested by wind and frost. But the Party supports us, and the Party has led us to set off an upsurge, and will also lead us to consolidate and develop. We have confidence that, no matter how many twists and turns there are, the future will definitely be better than it is now.

    At that time, we will not only maintain all the existing environmental hygiene habits, but also vigorously promote personal hygiene. Taking a bath every day will not be difficult; wearing two sets of clothes at work and at home will not be a problem; washing clothes has long replaced the mallet with soap. All kinds of sports activities will spread throughout the township, and our team will play all over the city. More singing teams will be organized, and there will be poets and actors everywhere. The club's evening parties will be held once a week, and a township with more than 10,000 people will have to produce several meritorious artists. The books borrowed the most from the library will be changed from comic books to agricultural science and technology books and Marxist-Leninist theory books. Literacy organizations will have long completed their historical tasks. Adults will be ashamed not to enter civil schools. All young people will be enrolled in school. In the university, with departments and faculties, production team leaders will attend the agronomy faculty, the animal husbandry faculty will recruit breeders, and the teacher education faculty will contract to train teachers for all vocational schools in the township, so that the rural cultural cadres can be self-sufficient.

    In the past, it seemed like a dream, but today, it seems like it's right in front of us.

　　这一切只是开始
　　中共永丰屯乡委员会书记　于连生
    我们北京市昌平区永丰屯的人，正在按照自己的共产主义理想，创造新的生活。仅仅半年，我们乡就发生了巨大的变化。
    冬天，我们没有守着热炕头盼望丰年。党领导我们大搞积肥打井运动，就是在这紧张的生产高潮里，搞起了卫生宣传。
  “扫帚响，粪堆长”，“除四害，讲卫生，田增产，人增寿。”本来是好事情嘛，一号召还不就干起来了。每天早晨，人们成群结队地扫地挑水，街道两旁用石灰刷的粉白。好事情是容易习惯的，每天不扫院子怎么能行呢？在我们的乡村里也第一次出现了公共厕所，谁家的粪坑上都有坑盖。有的街道上还设有痰盂。
    春天，我们胜利地完成了打井积肥任务。积肥每亩二万斤。打井一千三百零四眼。面对着这空前的胜利，我们唱起来了，跳起来了。一下子成立了许多歌咏队：姊妹合唱队，兄弟合唱队，老头合唱队，还有小脚英雄队。树荫下，老爷爷抱着小孙一齐合唱；歇工时，七十五岁的老大娘自编自演，又歌又舞；老大爷们快板不离嘴，说来就来。在田间是一片“社会主义好”的歌声。粉白的墙上写上了新诗，这里是：“小伙子真叫棒，一天到晚不沾炕”；那边是“咱们社人人夸，昌平西南一朵花”。想了多少年的俱乐部搞起来了，一村一个，吹拉弹唱，都屋里坐。一年一次的晚会哪能满足要求，一月一次还嫌少哩！又是扫盲晚会，又是庆功晚会，还有各式各样的联欢会。自排自演，省钱省事，一个比一个热闹。一掌灯，人们不再摸黑瞎扯了，到俱乐部去坐坐，看书的看书，下棋的下棋。各种各样的创作如雨后春笋，百花盛开。就这样，我们在幸福的歌声中迎接了夏天。
    技术革命和文化革命的冲锋号响了。有人创造了脚踏水车，有人创造了手摇水车，人们的心眼开始活了，但马上又感到了困难，没有文化不行啊！但过去正规学校的大门是向不能脱离生产的人紧闭着的，青年更是着急，失学几年了，难道就这样完了吗！社会主义不能没有文化。于是，我们大张旗鼓地搞起了扫盲，大战一百八十天扫完。五天内又给青年农民创办了四个半工半读的农业中学，每社一个，上午学习，下午劳动，免费上课。三间小屋虽然不济，可是学习却是理论联系实际。不能半天学习的青年们，还可以去上一周两堂课的青年业余技术学校。乡社干部和生产积极分子当中有文化高的，政治经验和生产经验丰富的，只是缺少理论，一般学校满足不了要求怎么办？总路线要我们敢想敢干，咱们何尝不能办一所大学？
    说干就干，原来规划三年内办的，现在不到一个月就办起来了。我们的红旗大学先上两门课：一门马列主义，一门农业原理。谁说我们的学校不是大学？咱们比比看，庄稼就是试卷。孩子们也有了自己的幸福乐园，村村都有幼儿队，妈妈们放心地劳动，孩子们受到了共产主义教育。这样一来，在我们乡就出现了一套比较完整的职业和业余教育体系，和正规学校组成社会主义教育的“两条腿”。图书馆每社一个，随处都能受到科学普及教育。
    早年间，这里不下雨就旱，下雨就涝。人们结伙逃荒到外面，作矿工，拉洋车。穷，就顾不上卫生啦！乡政府前面的大街就是一条臭沟，什么脏东西不往里边倒啊？痛苦的担子沉重地压在人们的肩上，气都喘不过来，怎么还唱得出来？解放以前，论文化，全乡只有一个初中学生，那个学生后来成了一个坏蛋。解放给我们带来了土地改革，经济上翻了身，合作化斩断了穷根，今天真正开始了文化翻身。
    这一切都只是开始。很多好东西还没有遍及全乡，已经建立的东西，还没有经过风霜的考验。但是党支持我们，党领导我们掀起了高潮，也将领导我们巩固和发展。我们有信心，尽管有多少波折，将来必定比现在还好。
    到那时，不仅保持了现有的全部环境卫生习惯，而且进而大搞个人卫生。每天洗个澡，没什么困难；工作时和在家时穿两套衣服不算什么；洗衣早已把棒捶换成肥皂。各种体育活动将遍及全乡，我们的球队要打遍全市。歌咏队将组织更多，遍地是诗人和演员。俱乐部的晚会将每周一次，一万多人口的一个乡怎样也得出几个功勋艺术家。图书馆出借最多的书将由小人书改为农业科学技术和马列主义理论书。扫盲组织早已完成历史任务。成年人都以没入民校为耻。青年人全部入学。大学里，分科，分系，生产队长上农学系，畜牧系收饲养员，师范教育系包干培养全乡职业学校教师，能够做到农村文化干部自给。
    这在过去看来，作梦也梦不见，而今天，就好像近在眼前了。
