Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th: Hong Kong dispatch: Many labor unions and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong have held gatherings in recent days to strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of patriotic education endeavors of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and their interference in the freedom of news coverage. They firmly demand that the Hong Kong British authorities punish the murderers, compensate for the losses, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

At the full council meeting held by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions on the evening of the 27th, the attending council members unanimously pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' open violation of the patriotic rights of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and their hostility towards the Chinese people are inseparable from their following the United States in creating the so-called "Two Chinas" conspiracy. The council members said: Workers in all industries in Hong Kong are extremely concerned about and attach importance to this incident. Workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon demand that the Hong Kong British authorities punish the perpetrators, compensate for the losses, apologize, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Workers from seven labor unions, including the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Trade Union, the Naval Dockyard Chinese Staff Union, the Tram Workers Union, the Taikoo Dockyard Chinese Staff Union, the Government Military Hospital Chinese Staff Union, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Dock and Wharf Carpentry General Union, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Underwear Workers Union, have also held gatherings successively, denouncing the Hong Kong British authorities for being hostile to the patriotic schools of Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon on the one hand, and condoning schools run by US-Chiang secret agents to carry out political activities against New China on the other hand.

Union member representatives of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association expressed at the gathering that they could hardly tolerate the Hong Kong British authorities' series of persecution measures. The representatives pointed out that the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people in Hong Kong is not something any force can suppress. Teacher representatives from many schools in the Eastern District of Hong Kong held a forum. In their speeches, everyone unanimously expressed strong protest against the British police's atrocities of punching, kicking, and using batons against teachers and students.

At a forum held by Hong Kong film workers, nearly a hundred representatives unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggle of teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School to safeguard the patriotic education cause. The directors of the Hong Kong North and South Merchants Association discussed the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of Chung Wah Middle School at the directors' regular meeting. The meeting decided to support Chung Wah Middle School's demands to the Hong Kong authorities for punishing the perpetrators, compensating for the losses, and promptly approving the construction of school buildings.

More than one hundred women representatives engaged in social welfare work protested the atrocities of the Hong Kong British police at a gathering on the 27th.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th: Hong Kong dispatch: Chung Wah Middle School in Hong Kong sent representatives on the afternoon of the 28th to deliver a letter of protest to the Hong Kong British Education Department. This letter of protest raised four demands to the Hong Kong British authorities regarding the incident of Hong Kong British police beating the school's staff and students.

The four demands are: 1. The Hong Kong police should apologize to the school's faculty, staff, and students; 2. Punish the perpetrators; 3. Compensate for all the school's losses; 4. Immediately cease all persecutory actions.

The letter of protest also proposed that in order to maintain the studies of Chung Wah Middle School students, the Hong Kong Public Works Department should immediately approve the construction of Chung Wah Middle School and be responsible for resolving all difficulties related to the school buildings before they are fully repaired.
