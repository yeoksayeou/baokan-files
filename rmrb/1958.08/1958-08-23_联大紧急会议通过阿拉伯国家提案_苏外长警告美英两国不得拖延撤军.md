Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session, convened to discuss the tense situation in the Near and Middle East caused by the armed intervention of the United States and Britain, concluded its work on the evening of the 21st. After the U.S. and Britain engaged in various activities of coercion and deception, and finding that their attempt to forcibly pass the "Seven-Nation" proposal they had concocted would not succeed, they had to retreat from their original position and reluctantly accept a proposal jointly put forward by ten Arab nations. Thus, this Arab nations' proposal was unanimously adopted at the General Assembly with eighty votes in favor, zero votes against, and zero abstentions. The representative of the Dominican Republic did not participate in the vote. The proposal was drafted by the representatives of ten Arab nations—the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Lebanon, and Jordan—after reaching an agreement on the 20th. On the 21st, before the start of the afternoon session of the General Assembly, representatives of the entire Arab-Asian group of countries held a meeting to discuss this proposal.

At the beginning of the afternoon session on the 21st, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahgoub, representing these ten Arab nations, formally presented the proposal. He particularly emphasized that the proposal he put forward was unanimously supported by all Arab nations represented or not yet represented in the United Nations. He said that this proposal demonstrates the desire of the people of Arab countries to ease international tensions. He requested that all member states of the United Nations General Assembly also unanimously support this proposal.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke.

Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation believes that the result of the discussion on the issue of the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, respectively, is that the vast majority of countries advocate the immediate and rapid withdrawal of these troops from the aforementioned countries. He said that we express complete satisfaction with this, because the Soviet government's starting point in proposing the convening of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting was the belief that the United Nations should speak forcefully on the necessity of the immediate and rapid withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Near and Middle East.

The resolution put forward through consultations by the ten Arab nations, despite some inadequacies in its wording, is in line with the main task facing the United Nations General Assembly: to advocate the rapid withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Near East, which is essentially in line with the Soviet proposal, because it addresses the fundamental issues that the General Assembly needs to address.

Gromyko expressed hope that the U.S. government and the British government would seriously listen to the call of the vast majority of United Nations member states advocating the immediate and rapid withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

He said: We would like to express the hope that the United States and Britain will not use various excuses and invoke various untenable reasons to delay the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops in violation of the decision of the General Assembly.

If the U.S. and British governments do not treat this decision seriously and delay the withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon and Jordan under various pretexts, then the Soviet government believes that it is now necessary to declare that it will raise this issue again with the United Nations at the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Gromyko said that it can be concluded from what I have said above that the Soviet delegation, although it once represented the Soviet government in submitting a proposal to the General Assembly for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Near East, is not prepared to insist on a priority vote on its own proposal.

Gromyko concluded by welcoming, in the name of the Soviet delegation and the Soviet government, the fact that the Arab countries had reached an agreement, and that after reaching an agreement, they put forward a unanimously agreed-upon proposal on the issue of the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Near East. Gromyko said that this is a good example that will serve the interests of the Arab countries, the interests of normalizing the situation in the Near and Middle East, the interests of strengthening peace in the region, and the interests of universal peace.

He said: The work of the United Nations General Assembly has achieved such a result, which serves the interests of peace well and has done something beneficial. We have no doubt that not only the Soviet people, but also the people of other countries, whether they have already joined the United Nations today or not, can only express deep satisfaction with this resolution.

Apparently, since the U.S. and Britain had already had to accept the Arab nations' proposal, the Norwegian representative said: His delegation, along with the other delegations that co-drafted the "Seven-Nation" proposal, did not object to letting the Arab nations' proposal be voted on before their proposal.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles then spoke, attempting to conceal the extremely isolated predicament and the failure suffered by the U.S. aggressors at the United Nations General Assembly. He began by repeating the old tune, saying: "The United States responded to the request automatically put forward by the Lebanese government because we believed that failure to respond to this request would inevitably make many small countries feel insecure and make many countries have the fatalistic idea of willingly enduring the inevitable fate of being ruled by a powerful neighbor." However, he also realized that this cliché no longer had much of a market, so he hurriedly argued: "But we do not believe that our actions are an ideal solution. A better solution would have been for the world family represented by the United Nations to take collective action. But this takes time."

Dulles then tried his best to distort the main spirit of the discussions at this United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting and the Arab nations' proposal, attempting to save face for the United States' embarrassing situation of being forced to accept this proposal, and to leave room for the United States to carry out conspiracies in the Near and Middle East and elsewhere in the future. He said that the General Assembly had reached a consensus on three basic propositions. The three basic propositions that Dulles spoke of were: "Every member state should respect the freedom, independence, and integrity of other countries, and earnestly avoid taking actions that incite internal strife in another country"; "The deployment of personnel by the United Nations in Lebanon and Jordan"; "Foreign troops that entered Lebanon and Jordan as an emergency measure should withdraw, and should withdraw immediately after other measures that can reasonably be taken to ensure the independence, security, and integrity of these countries have been taken." Here, Dulles played the trick of adding sand to rice, attempting to smuggle his "indirect aggression theory" and his conspiracy to interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries under the banner of the United Nations into some beautiful words that he could not avoid. But nevertheless, it can be seen that he could not but acknowledge that the representatives of all countries unanimously demanded the withdrawal of U.S. and British aggressor troops.

Dulles indicated that the United States could accept the Arab nations' proposal, although he also indicated that he "preferred" the seven-nation proposal. When comparing the Arab nations' proposal with the seven-nation proposal of Norway and other countries, he deliberately confused the principled differences between the two proposals, wanting to say that the two proposals were "roughly the same." Although everyone knows that the seven-nation proposal did not stipulate the early withdrawal of U.S. and British troops at all, and this was precisely the focus of the discussion at this conference and the most painful point for the United States. Dulles pretended not to understand this point and insisted that these two proposals were "different in form in the part about troop withdrawal, although we believe that there is no difference in substance." Then he made a nonchalant appearance and said: "The United States hopes to withdraw its troops from Lebanon at the earliest practicable moment. We said this when we entered. Since then, we have said this almost every day; we and the United Kingdom also solemnly declared our position in letters to the President of this General Assembly. We are pleased that the United Nations will assume the responsibilities that we reluctantly assumed in an emergency and are extremely eager to shed." Dulles even shamelessly said the following passage: "In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the U.S. government for the fact that, no matter what some people have said, it seems that every country here truly believes that the goals of the United States in this matter are upright. This is an appreciation that we are very grateful for, and we will always strive not to live up to this appreciation." Dulles's magical powers are truly great; after he said this, it was as if the representatives of all countries had not condemned or been dissatisfied with the U.S. aggression at the conference, but had praised it.

Dulles regretted that the Arab nations' proposal did not mention the establishment of a so-called "United Nations Permanent Peace Force," but he said that "the thirteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly will in any case consider this issue."

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also spoke in the same tone.

The representatives of Ceylon, Japan, India, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, El Salvador, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Israel also spoke at the meeting. Their speeches in fact explained their reasons for voting in favor of the Arab nations' proposal.

The representative of Ceylon welcomed the agreement reached by the Arab nations on this proposal and the common unity shown by the entire Arab-Asian group at the meeting.

The Indian representative emphasized that the main advantage of the Arab nations' proposal is that it stipulates the rapid withdrawal of British and American troops from Jordan and Lebanon. He added that the seven-nation proposal of Norway and other countries was unacceptable to the Indian delegation because it did not require the withdrawal of troops.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation said that despite some shortcomings in the Arab nations' proposal, his delegation would vote in favor of it. He hoped that the adoption of this proposal by the United Nations General Assembly would lead to the fastest withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, which would help consolidate peace in the Near and Middle East.

Then the Arab nations' proposal was put to a vote. The Soviet proposal and the "Seven-Nation" proposal were not put to a vote.

After the resolution was passed, the General Assembly discussed the report of the Credentials Committee. After the discussion, the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session declared its closure.

　　联大紧急会议通过阿拉伯国家提案  苏外长警告美英两国不得拖延撤军
    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：讨论由于美英两国的武装干涉行动而引起的中近东紧张局势问题的联合国大会紧急特别会议，21日晚间结束了它的工作。由于美英在作了种种硬压欺骗的活动以后，发现它们想强行通过它们一手制造的“七国”提案的企图不会成功，它们就不得不从原先的立场后退，勉强接受由十个阿拉伯国家联合提出的一项提案。于是，这个阿拉伯国家提案就在大会上以八十票赞成、零票反对、零票弃权被一致通过。多米尼加代表没有参加投票。这个提案是由十个阿拉伯国家——阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、也门、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥、利比亚、黎巴嫩、约旦——的代表在20日取得协议后草拟的。21日，在大会下午会议开始之前，整个阿拉伯——亚洲集团各国的代表举行会议就这个提案进行了讨论。
    21日下午会议开始时，苏丹外交部长马哈古卜代表这十个阿拉伯国家正式提出了这项提案。他特别强调提出，他所提出的提案受到所有在联合国有代表或者还没有代表的阿拉伯国家的一致支持。他说，这项提案表明阿拉伯各国人民缓和国际紧张局势的愿望。他要求联合国大会所有会员国也都一致支持这个提案。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯发言。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团认为，讨论有关美军和英军分别撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的结果，绝大多数国家都主张这些军队立即迅速地撤出上述国家。他说，我们对这一点表示完全满意，因为苏联政府建议召开联合国大会紧急会议的出发点，就是认为联合国应当对美英军队立即迅速撤出中近东的必要性说出有分量的话。
    十个阿拉伯国家协商提出的决议尽管在措词上有某些不足，但是它符合联合国大会所面临的主要任务：主张美英军队迅速撤出近东，这在实质上是符合苏联的建议的，因为它谈到了大会需要谈的基本东西。
    葛罗米柯希望美国政府以及英国政府认真地听取主张美英军队立即迅速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的联合国绝大多数会员国的呼声。
    他说：我们愿意表示希望，美国和英国不致再用形形色色的借口和假借各种各样站不住脚的理由来拖延美英两国军队的撤退而违反大会的决定。
    如果美英两国政府不严肃认真地对待这个决定而用各式各样的借口拖延从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退自己的军队，那么苏联政府认为，现在就有必要声明，它将在联合国大会常会上再向联合国提出这个问题。
    葛罗米柯说，从我上面所说的可以得出结论，苏联代表团虽然曾经代表苏联政府把一项关于立即从近东撤退美英军队的建议提请大会讨论，但是并不准备坚持优先表决自己的提案。
    葛罗米柯最后以苏联代表团和苏联政府的名义欢迎阿拉伯国家之间达成了协议这个事实，它们在达成协议之后提出了一致同意的关于从近东撤退美英两国军队问题的建议。葛罗米柯说，这是一个良好的榜样，它会符合阿拉伯国家的利益，中近东局势正常化的利益，加强这一地区的和平的利益以及普遍和平的利益。
    他说：联合国大会的工作取得了这样的结果，它很好地为和平的利益服务，并且作了有益的事情。我们毫不怀疑，不仅是苏联人民，而且其他不论今天是否已经参加联合国的国家的人民都只能对这个决议表示深深的满意。
    显然，由于美英已经不得不接受阿拉伯国家提案，挪威代表发言说：他的代表团同共同草拟“七国”提案的其他代表团都不反对让阿拉伯国家提案在他们的提案之先表决。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯接着发言，他极力掩饰美国侵略者在联合国大会上的极端孤立的困境和遭到的失败。他一开始就重弹老调说：“美国之所以响应黎巴嫩政府自动提出的要求，是因为我们相信，如果不响应这种要求，就一定会使许多小国有一种不安全感，并且使许多国家有听天由命的想法，甘愿忍受为强大邻国所统治这个不可避免的命运。”不过他也意识到这种滥调已经没有什么市场，因此赶忙强辩说：“但是我们并不认为我们的行动是理想的解决办法。比较好的解决办法本来是由联合国所代表的世界大家庭采取集体行动。但是这需要时间。”
    杜勒斯接着就竭力歪曲这次联合国大会紧急会议的讨论和阿拉伯国家提案的主要精神，企图为美国被迫接受这一提案的窘态挽回面子，并且为美国今后在中近东以及其他地方施展阴谋留下伏笔。他说，大会在三个基本主张上取得了一致意见。杜勒斯所说的三个基本主张是：“每一个会员国应当尊重其他国家的自由、独立和完整，并且认真地避免采取煽动另一国家的内争的行动”；“由联合国在黎巴嫩和约旦派驻人员”；“作为紧急措施进入黎巴嫩和约旦的外国军队应当撤退，并且应当在为了保证这些国家的独立、安全和完整而可以合理采取的其他措施采取以后立即撤退”。在这里杜勒斯玩弄了往米里掺砂子的手法，企图把他的“间接侵略论”和利用联合国旗帜干涉黎巴嫩、约旦和别的国家的内政的阴谋夹带到他无法避开的某些漂亮的言词中来。但是尽管如此，也可以看出：他无法不承认各国代表都一致要求撤退美英侵略军。
    杜勒斯表示，美国可以接受阿拉伯国家提案，虽然他也表明他“更喜欢”七国提案。他在把阿拉伯国家提案和挪威等七国提案作比较时故意混淆两者的原则区别，想把这两个提案说成是“大体上是相同的”。虽然大家知道，七国提案中根本没有规定美英早日撤出军队，而这一点正是这次大会讨论的焦点，也是美国的最痛之处。杜勒斯装作不懂这一点，硬说这两个提案在有关撤军部分上“在形式上有所不同，虽然我们认为在实质上没有什么不同”。接着他又作出满不在乎的样子说：“美国希望在切实可行的最早的时刻把它的军队撤出黎巴嫩。我们在开进去的时候曾经这样说过。在那以后，我们差不多每天都在这样说；我们和联合王国在给本大会主席的函件中也庄严地申明了我们的立场。我们感到高兴的是，联合国将担负起我们在紧急情况下勉强担负的、并且极想卸掉的那些责任。”杜勒斯甚至还厚着脸皮说出了这样的一段话：“在这方面，我想利用这个机会代表美国政府表示对这样一点的感激：不论有些人说了什么话，似乎这里的每一个国家都确实相信美国在这条事情上的目标是正直的。这是一种我们非常感激的赞赏，我们将永远努力不辜负这种赞赏。”杜勒斯的神通可真广大，经他这么一说，仿佛各国代表根本没有在大会上谴责或不满美国的侵略倒是赞扬了它似的。
    杜勒斯遗憾阿拉伯国家提案中没有提到建立所谓“联合国常备和平部队”问题，但是他说“第十三届联合国大会会议无论如何终将考虑这个问题”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德也以同样的口吻作了发言。
    在会议上发言的还有锡兰、日本、印度、菲律宾、荷兰、澳大利亚、比利时、萨尔瓦多、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克、希腊和以色列的代表。他们的发言事实上是解释了他们所以将要投票赞成阿拉伯国家提案的理由。
    锡兰代表对阿拉伯国家在这个提案取得一致和整个阿拉伯——亚洲集团在会议上表现的共同一致表示欢迎。
    印度代表着重指出，阿拉伯国家提案的主要优点是：它规定英美军队迅速撤离约旦和黎巴嫩。他补充说，挪威等“七国”提案是印度代表团所不能接受的，因为它没有要求撤退军队。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长说，尽管阿拉伯国家的提案有某些缺点，他的代表团将投票赞成这个提案。他希望联合国大会采纳这个提案将导致美英军队最快地撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，这样将有助于巩固中近东的和平。
    接着阿拉伯国家的提案付诸表决。苏联提案和“七国”提案没有付诸表决。
    决议通过以后，大会讨论了全权证书委员会的报告。讨论结束以后，联合国大会紧急特别会议宣告闭幕。
