Aohan Banner's sheep improvement work began in 1951. At that time, a sheep farm was first established in Hasa Tu Cha (township name). Over the years, this farm has not only played a significant demonstrative role in sheep improvement but has also promoted more than 1,500 fine-wool breeding sheep. Currently, the farm still maintains more than 5,000 breeding sheep. This farm has become the base for our sheep improvement.

The sheep improvement work among the masses can be divided into two stages: the first stage, from 1951 to 1952, was the stage of cultivating models, summarizing experiences, and establishing examples. The second stage, from 1953 onwards, adopted the approach of connecting points into lines, lines into areas, and blooming everywhere on a large scale. In 1953, nineteen artificial insemination stations were established in thirty-one villages in six districts out of the two hundred and five villages in the twelve districts of the banner. By 1956, it had been popularized throughout the banner, with a total of fifty stations and seventy-four insemination points, breeding more than 21,000 ewes. By 1957, a total of more than 73,000 ewes had been bred. In 1958, the banner retained more than 35,000 improved sheep, basically achieving the goal of having improved sheep in every township and every commune. Twelve sheep improvement communes and fifty-five improved villages emerged. In Hasa Tu Cha and other places, sixteen flocks of sheep have all been transformed into improved sheep.

After several years of improvement, the quality of sheep has been significantly improved. For example, the birth weight of local sheep is only 5.6 jin, while that of first-generation improved lambs is 6.8 jin, an increase of 600 grams in weight. The net meat yield after slaughter of a first-generation one-and-a-half-year-old castrated sheep is 36.4 jin, while that of local wethers is only 20.5 jin. Wool production has also increased significantly. The wool yield of first-generation adult ewes on sheep farms is 5.1 jin, that of second-generation sheep is 8.6 jin, and that of third-generation sheep is 9.2 jin, which is 2.4 times higher than that of local sheep. Under the current breeding and management conditions of the masses, the spring wool yield of first-generation sheep is on average 70% higher than that of local sheep. In terms of wool fineness, sheep of the second generation and above have basically eliminated dead hair and coarse hair, meeting the requirements of the national wool textile industry.

The increase in the quantity and quality of wool has greatly increased the income of commune members. According to a survey in Pingdingmiao Township, the average wool income per local sheep (more than 1,400 sheep) was 1.97 yuan, while the average income per improved sheep (more than 1,200 sheep) was 5.05 yuan. The wool income of each improved sheep is equivalent to that of more than two local sheep. According to a 1958 survey by the Fifth and Fourth Cooperative in the township, more than 400 local sheep produced more than 1,300 jin of wool, with an average wool yield of 2.7 jin per sheep; more than 1,600 improved sheep produced more than 7,000 jin of wool, with an average wool yield of 4.7 jin per sheep. The value of wool from each improved sheep was more than 8 yuan, exceeding the income of local sheep by more than two times. The masses reflected that raising one improved sheep is equivalent to cultivating one mu of land, and raising ten improved sheep ensures that the whole family has enough to eat and wear. In recent years, our banner has supplied the state with more than 260,000 jin of fine wool and semi-fine wool, which has not only strongly supported industrial construction but also increased the income of commune members.

Through artificial insemination crossbreeding and improvement, the infertility rate of ewes has been further reduced, and the twin lamb rate has increased significantly. For example, in 1957, the Friendship Cooperative used fine-wool rams to breed 761 ewes by artificial insemination, of which 92 ewes had twin lambs, accounting for 12% of the twin lamb rate.

Through several years of practical work, we have the following experiences:

(1) Putting politics in command and mobilizing the entire Party is the basic condition for doing a good job in sheep improvement.

In carrying out sheep improvement work, the problems we encountered were ideological resistance, lack of experience, and particularly insufficient technical strength, equipment, and facilities. Some people did not initially believe in the benefits of improved sheep, so we first established experimental points, set up examples, and let the masses see; if there were insufficient breeding sheep, we made great efforts to run breeding sheep farms, so that we had a surplus of breeding sheep; if there was no experience, we cultivated models and the leadership personally took charge; if there was insufficient technical strength, we trained a large number of farmer and herdsman artificial insemination technicians. In order to vigorously develop animal husbandry production and sheep improvement, and to thoroughly overcome the idea of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry, we resolutely implemented the production policy of equal emphasis on agriculture and animal husbandry.

(2) Establishing organizations at all levels and forming a strong leadership structure from top to bottom.

In our sheep improvement work, the banner has the Party Secretary and the banner head, the township has the Party Secretary and the township head, and the communes and teams also have a strong director and team leader in charge of sheep improvement. From the perspective of technical institutions, a sound system has also been formed. For example, the banner has a sheep improvement guidance station, an animal husbandry and veterinary station, and a laboratory; the township has a joint animal husbandry and veterinary station (a total of ten). Every year during the breeding season, dozens of breeding stations and insemination points are also set up, and each commune has also established an animal husbandry technical guidance committee.

In order to adapt to the high-speed reproduction of mountain sheep and improvement work in the future, the banner and township have now also established livestock improvement committees, the township has established livestock improvement central stations, and the commune has established sheep artificial insemination stations, large livestock breeding stations, and veterinary prevention and treatment stations. This is a major organizational measure to ensure the success of sheep improvement work.

(3) Adhering to the mass line is a method of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Initially, the masses had many concerns about using artificial insemination and crossbreeding to improve sheep breeds. For example, they were afraid that the ewes would not conceive; they were afraid of dystocia after conception because the breeding sheep were large; they were afraid that improved sheep would be difficult to care for; they were afraid that improved sheep meat would not be delicious; they were afraid that mottled lambs would be worthless; they were afraid of not being able to wear sheepskin coats, etc. To rely on the masses, we must first dispel their concerns and let them first understand the benefits of improved sheep. We set up more demonstration points and established examples of improved sheep everywhere, and we would organize the masses to visit the sites at any time, and combine it with practical operations to demonstrate to the masses on the spot. In order to dispel the concerns of the masses, we also widely carried out propaganda and mobilization work with the most vivid examples in the local area. After they saw the benefits of improvement, not only did they not doubt it, but they also actively demanded improvement. This is the ideological foundation for relying on the masses.

With the development of sheep improvement work, the first problem we encountered was that the technical strength was far behind the needs. How to solve this problem? Before 1954, our method of solving this problem was mainly to rely on higher authorities to send technical cadres, and we regarded sheep improvement work as too mysterious, did not believe in the masses, and therefore were unwilling to pass on the technology to the masses. Practical experience has told us that to do a good job in sheep improvement, we must adhere to the mass line, boldly believe in the masses, and rely on the masses. Therefore, since 1954, we have completely reversed the phenomenon of state monopoly, and mass movements have developed rapidly.

In order to give play to the enthusiasm of the cooperatives, we have transferred all sheep artificial insemination equipment and medicines to the cooperatives at a price since 1956, and the price will be repaid by the cooperative in installments within two or three years. The consumption of equipment and medicines will be reimbursed by the state according to a fixed quota. This not only strengthened the initiative and responsibility of the cooperatives in improving sheep, solved the difficulty of insufficient technology, but also saved state funds. In 1956 alone, fuel costs and other miscellaneous expenses saved the state more than 6,000 yuan. We will also transfer breeding sheep to the cooperatives starting this year.

(4) Improving sheep breeds and improving feeding management must go hand in hand to consolidate and continuously improve the production performance of improved sheep.

The feeding management level not keeping up with the living needs of hybrid improved sheep is an outstanding problem we have encountered in sheep improvement. The introduction of fine-wool breeding sheep for hybrid improvement, with the improvement of the number of generations, must be accompanied by corresponding improvements in feeding management conditions and management levels. However, in the first two years, we only focused on improvement and neglected to improve feeding management. In particular, due to insufficient fodder reserves for the winter and spring, the mortality rate of hybrid improved lambs increased compared to local sheep in many places, and the wool yield did not increase significantly. Therefore, among the masses, and even among some cadres, it was believed that improved sheep were not easy to manage and that the more they were improved, the more they degenerated. Therefore, the saying that "a little improvement in the first year, a big improvement in the second year, and a closing down in the third year" was drawn. It was also generally believed that improvement could not continue after the second generation.

Hybrid improvement must go hand in hand with improving feeding management. The following measures have been mainly taken to improve feeding management:

First, actively establish feed bases and store enough fodder. Second, protect female animals and increase the proportion of female animals. Third, focus on good breeding with good condition. Fourth, rectify livestock herds, implement classified management according to type and grade, and graze in separate groups. Fifth, improve pen facilities. Sixth, strengthen disease prevention and control. Seventh, herdsmen are direct producers, so selecting outstanding commune members to be herdsmen plays a direct role in developing animal husbandry production and doing a good job in livestock improvement.

(5) Adhere to the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry.

In the past, we had deviated to the left and right in implementing this policy. In pastoral areas, there was a tendency to independently develop animal husbandry and neglect agriculture and diversified operations. In this case, not only did animal husbandry production not develop rapidly, but it became slower. When we adopted the policy of focusing on animal husbandry and combining agriculture and animal husbandry, we achieved a bumper harvest in both agriculture and animal husbandry. From the history of agricultural and animal husbandry development in our banner, the complementary relationship and role between agricultural and animal husbandry production is extremely close. In 1950, Aohan agriculture was a bumper year, and the net increase rate of large livestock in the following year was 20%, and that of sheep was 35.1%; in 1951, agriculture was a normal year, the net increase of large livestock was 16%, and that of sheep was 20%; in 1952, agriculture was a poor harvest year, and the net increase of large livestock in the following year was 11%, and that of sheep was 13%; in 1953, agriculture was a bumper year, and the net increase of large livestock in the following year was 15%, and that of sheep was 33.6%. It has become even more significant in recent years.

    敖汉旗的绵羊改良工作
    中共内蒙古自治区敖汉旗委书记　于恩波
    敖汉旗绵羊改良工作是从1951年开始的，当时首先在哈萨吐?查（乡名）建立了一处绵羊牧场，几年来这个场子不仅在绵羊改良工作上起了很大的示范作用，而且还推广了细毛种羊一千五百余只，现在场内还保有五千余只种羊。这个场子已成为我们绵羊改良的基地。
    在群众中开展绵羊改良工作，可以分为两个阶段：第一阶段，从1951年到1952年，是培养典型，总结经验，树立样子的阶段。第二个阶段，是1953年以后，采取了以点串点，点点带片，遍地开花的大搞阶段。1953年全旗十二个区二百零五个村，就在六个区三十一个村设立了十九处人工授精站。到1956年就普及到全旗，共设五十个站，七十四个输精点，配母羊两万一千多只。到1957年共配母羊七万三千多只，1958年全旗共保存改良羊三万五千余只，基本上达到了乡乡、社社都有改良羊，并出现了十二个绵羊改良化的社，五十五个改良化屯，哈萨吐?查等地有十六个羊群全部变成了改良羊。
    经过几年来的改良，羊的质量上已有显著的提高。如本地羊初生重仅五点六斤，一代改良羔羊六点八斤，体重增加了六百克。一代一岁半的去势羊，屠宰后的净肉量为三十六点四斤，本地羯羊则仅为二十点五斤。产毛量也有显著提高。绵羊牧场一代成年母羊剪毛量为五点一斤，二代羊八点六斤，三代羊剪毛量为九点二斤，比本地羊提高二点四倍。在目前群众的饲养管理条件下，春毛产量一代羊平均比本地羊毛提高70％。在羊毛的细度上，二代以上的羊就基本上消灭了死毛和发毛，符合国家毛纺工业的要求。
    由于羊毛数量和质量的提高，大大增加了社员的收入。据平顶庙乡的调查，本地羊一千四百多只，平均每只羊毛的收入为一点九七元，改良羊一千二百多只平均每只收入五点零五元，每只改良羊毛的收入相等于两只多本地羊毛的收入。该乡五四社1958年的调查，四百多只本地羊共产毛一千三百多斤，每只羊平均产毛二点七斤；一千六百多只改良羊共产毛七千多斤，每只平均产毛四点七斤，改良羊每只毛的价值八元多，超过本地羊收入的两倍以上。群众反映：养一只改良羊等于种一亩地，养十只改良羊，全家老少不愁吃穿。几年来我旗供给国家细毛、半细毛达二十六万余斤，不仅有力地支援了工业建设，同时也增加了社员的收入。
    通过人工授精杂交改良，进一步减少了母羊不孕率，双胎率显著增加了。如友谊社，1957年利用细毛种公羊用人工授精的方法，配母羊七百六十一只，其中有九十二只母羊下了双羔，双羔率占12％。
    通过几年来的实际工作，我们有以下几点体验：
    （一）政治挂帅，全党动手，是搞好绵羊改良工作的基本条件。
    我们在开展绵羊改良工作上，碰到的问题，是旧的思想抵触，没经验，特别是技术力量、器材、设备等更感不足。有些群众开始不相信改良羊的好处，我们就先搞试验点，树立样子，让群众看；种羊不足，我们就大力去办种羊场，作到了种羊自给有余；没有经验，就通过培养典型，领导亲自抓；技术力量不足，就大量培养农牧民人工授精技术员。为了大力发展畜牧业生产和绵羊改良事业，彻底克服重农轻牧思想，我们坚决执行了农牧并重的生产方针。
    （二）层层建立组织，从上到下组成了一个强有力的领导机构。
    我们在绵羊改良工作上，旗有旗委书记、旗长，乡有乡委书记、乡长，社、队也都有一名强有力的主任和队长专管绵羊改良工作。从技术机构来看，也构成了一个健全的系统。比如旗有绵羊改良辅导站，畜牧兽医工作站，化验室；乡有联合畜牧兽医工作站（共有十处）。每年到配种季节还设立几十处配种站和输精点，社社还成立了畜牧技术指导委员会。
    为了适应今后高速度的繁殖山绵羊和改良工作，现在旗乡还成立了牲畜改良委员会，乡设立了牲畜改良中心站，社设立了绵羊人工授精站、大家畜配种站、兽医防治站。这是保证搞好绵羊改良工作的一项主要的组织措施。
    （三）坚持群众路线的方法，是多快好省的方法。
    最初，群众对绵羊采用人工授精杂交，改良羊种存有许多顾虑。如怕不准胎；怕准胎后因种羊个子大，发生难产；怕改良羊不好侍弄；怕改良羊肉不好吃；怕出花羔不值钱；怕穿不上羊皮袄等等。要依靠群众，就必须先解除群众的顾虑，叫他们先了解到改良羊的好处。搞多点示范，到处树立改良羊的样子，就随时组织群众到现场参观，并结合实际操作，当场给群众表演。为了解除群众的顾虑，并以当地最生动的实例，广泛的开展了宣传鼓动工作。当他们看到改良的好处后，不但不怀疑，而且积极要求改良。这是依靠群众的思想基础。
    随着绵羊改良工作的开展，我们首先遇到的问题，就是技术力量远远赶不上需要。怎样解决这个问题呢？1954年以前，我们把解决这个问题的方法，主要寄托在上级给派技术干部，把绵羊改良工作看得过于神秘，不相信群众，因而也就不愿意把技术交给群众。实践的经验告诉了我们，搞好绵羊改良工作，必须坚持群众路线的方法，大胆的相信群众，依靠群众。因此，我们从1954年以后，就彻底的扭转了由国家包办的现象，群众性的运动迅速开展起来。
    为了发挥合作社的积极性，我们从1956年起就将绵羊人工授精器材、药品全部作价交社，价款由社在二、三年内分期偿还，器材药品的消耗由国家按定额报销。这不仅加强了合作社改良绵羊的主动性和责任心，解决了技术不足的困难，而且也节省了国家资金，1956年仅燃料费和其他杂项开支就给国家节省了六千余元。我们从今年起把种羊也要下放到合作社。
    （四）改良羊种和改进饲养管理同时并举才能巩固和不断提高改良绵羊的生产性能。
    饲养管理水平跟不上杂交改良羊的生活需要，是我们在绵羊改良中遇到的突出的问题。引用细毛种羊杂交改良，随着改良代数的提高，必须与此相适应的改善饲养管理条件和经营水平。可是我们在头二年就只抓改良，忽视了改善饲养管理，特别是由于过冬过春饲草贮备不足，不少地方杂交改良羔羊死亡率比本地羊增加了，产毛量也未有显著的提高。因此，在群众中，甚至在一些干部中，就认为改良羊不好经营，越改越退化。因而就得出了这样一种说法，一年搞点，二年大搞，三年收摊子。并较普遍的认为，改良到二代以后就不能再继续进行改良。
    杂交改良必须与改善饲养管理同时并举。在改进饲养管理上，主要是采取了下面几项措施：
    第一，积极建立饲料基地，贮备足够饲草。第二，保护母畜，提高母畜的比重。第三，抓好膘配好种。第四，整顿畜群，实行按类分等管理，分群放牧。第五，改善圈棚设备。第六，加强疫病防治工作。第七，牧工是直接生产者，因此，选择优秀社员当牧工，对于发展畜牧业生产，搞好牲畜改良起着直接的作用。
    （五）坚持农牧结合的方针。
    我们过去在执行这个方针上，曾有过左右摇摆的偏向，在牧区曾一度发生过独立发展牧业，忽视农业及多种经营的偏向。在这种情况下，牧业生产非但没有迅速发展反而变得更缓慢了。当采取了以牧为主，农牧结合的方针时，便取得了农牧业双丰收。从我旗农牧业发展的历史来看，农牧业生产之间相辅相成的关系和作用是极为密切的。1950年敖汉农业是大丰收年，而次年大家畜纯增率为20％，羊为35.1％；1951年农业是正常年，大家畜纯增16％，羊为20％；1952年农业是歉收年，次年大家畜纯增为11％，羊为13％；1953年农业是丰收年，次年大家畜纯增15％，羊为33.6％。最近几年来表现得更为显著。
