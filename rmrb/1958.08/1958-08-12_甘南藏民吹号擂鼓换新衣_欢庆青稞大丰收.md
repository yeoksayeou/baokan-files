Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th — Tibetan people's main food crop, highland barley, has had an unprecedented bumper harvest in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. This year, the average yield per mu of the 239,000-plus mu of highland barley sown throughout the prefecture has more than doubled on the basis of last year's 200 jin, and many high-yield records have emerged. The average yield per mu in eight townships of Lintan County reached 907 jin. An experimental plot of one mu in the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative of this county yielded 1,481 jin, with a yield per mu more than 15 times that of previous years.

The fact that Gannan's highland barley has had a bumper harvest has powerfully shattered the "low-yield theory of highland barley." Highland barley is a crop similar to barley, suitable for planting in high-altitude and cold areas, and has characteristics such as cold resistance and drought resistance. Highland barley is stir-fried, then ground into flour, and mixed with strong tea and ghee to make "tsampa," which is a staple food widely loved by Tibetan people. In the past, due to extensive cultivation, the yield of highland barley in the vast Tibetan areas has always been very low.

After the autonomous prefecture fully realized agricultural cooperativization this year, a surge of "learning from the Han people and catching up with the Han people" was launched. Farmers of all ethnic groups built water conservancy projects and vigorously carried out agricultural tool reforms, changing primitive farming methods.

Currently, farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture are burning pine smoke, blowing horns and beating drums, changing into new clothes, and tasting new grain, joyfully celebrating the harvest.

### 甘南藏民吹号擂鼓换新衣　欢庆青稞大丰收

　　甘南藏民吹号擂鼓换新衣
　　欢庆青稞大丰收
    据新华社兰州11日电　藏族人民的主要粮食——青稞，在甘南藏族自治州得到破天荒的大丰收。今年全州播种的二十三万九千多亩青稞，平均每亩产量在去年二百斤的基础上猛增一倍多，并出现了许多高产纪录。临潭县八个乡的平均亩产量达到九百零七斤，这个县先锋农业社的一亩试验田，收了一千四百八十一斤，亩产量超过往年十五倍。
    甘南青稞大丰收的事实有力地打破了“青稞低产论”。青稞是一种类似大麦的作物，适宜于高寒地带种植，有耐寒抗旱等特性。青稞炒熟后再磨成粉，用浓茶水和酥油拌揉，便制成“糌粑”，是藏族人民普遍喜爱的一种主食品。过去由于耕作粗放，广大藏区青稞的产量一直很低。
    自治州今年全部实现农业合作化以后，掀起了“学汉族，赶汉族”的热潮，各族农民大修水利和大闹农具改革，改变原始的耕作方法。
    目前，自治州各族农民正燃烧松烟、吹号擂鼓，换新衣、尝新粮，欢欣鼓舞地喜庆丰收。
