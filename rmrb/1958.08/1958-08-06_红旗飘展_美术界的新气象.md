Red Flag Flying
—A New Look in the Art World
    Li Qun

    After the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the art world has undergone great changes, and the distinct red flag of the proletariat is flying everywhere.

    If, before the anti-Rightist struggle, the art world had serious phenomena of being divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and neglecting popularization, appearing stagnant and lifeless, then now it has inserted the red flag of putting politics in command, closely linking with reality, serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and putting popularization first. It is full of vitality and has a brand new look.

    Not long ago, after the general line was proposed, the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, under the direct leadership of the academy's Party committee and with the president taking personal command, launched a high tide of propaganda poster creation. Teachers and students worked together, turning classrooms into workshops. While studying the documents in depth, they conceived and created propaganda posters, working day and night for a day and a half, creating more than sixty propaganda posters.

    At the same time, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, the internal art workers of the Tianjin Fine Arts Publishing House also rushed out sixteen "Illustrated Explanations of the General Line of Socialist Construction" in a week by twelve people. In addition, the Beijing Cartoon Editorial Department also organized many cartoonists to collectively create eight cartoon illustrations of "Striving to Realize the Socialist General Line." Furthermore, before this, more than seventy teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, in the space of two months, while carrying out a very tense rectification movement, also mustered their energy to spare time to collectively create seventy-five "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) Propaganda Wall Charts" with very complex content.

    For example, in May, Beijing artists participated in short-term labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir project. After returning to their respective work positions, in just twenty days, they mustered their energy, seized the time, and created paintings reflecting the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. Organized by the Literature and Art Brigade of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the China Artists Association, on June 20th, these works were taken to the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir to hold an exhibition of more than two hundred "Ming Tombs Reservoir Art Works." These works depicted the magnificent labor scenes of the construction site and portraits of some heroic figures, and were therefore warmly welcomed by the reservoir builders. Someone wrote on the opinion form: "I love all the exhibited works, and I have never loved art works as much as I do today: because it is real life - our life." This rapid approach of coming from the masses at the construction site and then quickly going to the masses at the construction site was an innovation in the art world. Recently, in the struggle to support the Arab people against the aggression of the United States and Britain, Beijing art workers have also actively wielded their brushes, working hard day and night, and created many militant propaganda posters, cartoons, and murals. In addition, at present, in Hebei, Shanghai, Chongqing… various vivid new things and new atmospheres in the art world are also emerging endlessly.

    Think back to the past situation, when it often took two or three months to create a propaganda poster, but now it only takes one or two days; at that time, many people were divorced from reality and closed themselves off to improve, but now, painters and their works are integrated with the working people. Isn't this the result of putting politics in command and mustering energy! Some people say that in literature and art, it is either "more, faster, worse, more expensive," or "less, slower, better, more expensive," and it is impossible to achieve "more, faster, better, cheaper." This fallacy, which is contrary to the spirit of the general line of socialist construction, has been refuted completely by the above facts.

    This time, the creation, publication, printing, and distribution of propaganda posters for the general line have all broken with conventions. We should pay attention to and summarize these experiences in order to push art work further forward.

    红旗飘展
    ——美术界的新气象
    力群
    在反右斗争和整风运动之后，美术界有了很大的变化，无产阶级的鲜明的红旗在到处飘扬。
    如果说在反右斗争之前，美术界曾存在过严重的脱离政治，脱离实际，轻视普及的现象，显得暮气沉沉，那么现在是插上了政治挂帅、紧密联系实际、为工农兵服务、普及第一的红旗。生气勃勃，面目一新了。
    不久前，中央工艺美术学院，在总路线提出之后，于该院党委的直接领导之下，院长亲自挂帅，掀起了总路线的宣传画创作高潮，师生一齐动手，把教室变成了车间，一面深入的钻研文件，一面进行宣传画的构思与创作，夜以继日地苦战了一天半的时间，绘制了六十余幅宣传画。
    与此同时，在天津市委的领导之下，天津美术出版社的内部美术工作者也在一周内由十二人赶制了“社会主义建设总路线图解”十六幅。此外，北京漫画编辑部也组织了许多漫画家集体创作了八幅“为实现社会主义总路线而奋斗”的漫画图解。又如，在这之前，中央美术学院师生七十余人，在两个月的期间内，一面进行十分紧张的整风运动，还一面鼓足干劲抽空集体创作了内容十分复杂的七十五张“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）宣传挂图”。
    再如北京美术家在5月中参加十三陵水库工程短期劳动，回到各个工作岗位后，在短短的二十天中，便鼓足干劲，争取时间，创作了反映十三陵水库建设的图画，在中国文学艺术界联合会文艺大队和中国美术家协会的组织之下，于6月20日把这些作品拿到十三陵水库工地举行了二百余幅的“十三陵水库美术作品展览”。这些作品描绘了工地壮丽的劳动场面和部分英雄人物的肖像，因此受到了水库建设者们的热烈欢迎，有人在意见表上写道：“我爱所有展出的作品，而且我从来没有像今天这样爱过美术作品：因为它是真正的生活——我们的生活”。这种迅速的从工地群众中来，又迅速的到工地群众中去的作法，在美术界是个创举。最近，在支援阿拉伯人民反对美英侵略的斗争中，北京的美术工作者们又积极挥动画笔，不分昼夜苦战，创作出了许多具有战斗性的宣传画、漫画和壁画。此外，目前在河北、上海、重庆……美术界的各种生动的新事物新气象也是层出不穷的。
    回想一下过去的情况吧，那时创作一幅宣传画经常要两三个月，而现在只要一两天的工夫；那时很多人脱离实际关门提高，而现在，画家和画家的作品都和劳动人民打成了一片。这难道不是政治挂帅和鼓足干劲的结果吗！有人说文学艺术上，要么就是“多快差省”，要么就是“少慢好费”，总归是做不到“多快好省”的。这种和社会主义建设总路线的精神相违背的谬论，已经被以上的事实给驳得体无完肤了。
    这次总路线的宣传画，从创作、出版、印刷和发行工作都打破了陈规，我们应当重视和总结这些经验，以便把美术工作更向前推进一步。
