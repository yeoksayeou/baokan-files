Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 2nd. "Solidarity" newspaper here published on July 29th a conversation by Iraqi Republic Minister of Agriculture Mahmoud to this newspaper's reporter regarding the Republic government's land policy.

He said that the Republic government is now studying a plan to limit private land ownership. However, the maximum limit has not yet been determined. Subsequently, the land will be distributed to farmers. Mahmoud said that the government is also planning to build irrigation projects to irrigate dry land.

When talking about the past status of farmers, Mahmoud said that Iraqi farmers account for 70% of the country's population, but they had no freedom in the past, no right to live in cities, and they would be punished if they tried to escape from the land of their sheikhs. Fines eventually took away all their income. Under the old regime, farmers established primitive means of self-defense. They decided not to submit disputes among themselves to the sheikh's court for resolution. They set up special funds to help punished farmers.

Mahmoud said that after the British invaded Iraq, they divided the land among the sheikhs in order to win their support for imperialism. In this way, the best 30% of Iraq's land became the property of the sheikhs, of which one hundred sheikhs occupied two-thirds of this 30% of the land. Small landowners own only 2% of the country's land.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 2nd. American President's "special envoy" Murphy left here this morning for the Republic of Iraq.

This veteran American conspirator, after directing the "presidential election" in Beirut, went to Jordan and Israel to conduct conspiratorial activities, and returned here yesterday.

U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock said this morning when announcing Murphy's trip to Iraq that Murphy will meet with Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem and other leaders.

    伊拉克农业部长谈土地政策
    准备限制私有土地　把土地分给农民
    新华社日内瓦2日电　这里的“团结报”在7月29日刊载了伊拉克共和国农业部长马哈茂德向这家报纸记者发表的关于共和国政府土地政策的一篇谈话。
    他说，共和国政府现在正在研究限制私有土地的计划。但是最高的限额尚未确定。随后将把土地分配给农民。马哈茂德说，政府还在计划修建灌溉工程，以灌溉干燥的土地。
    马哈茂德在谈到农民过去的地位时说，伊拉克农民占全国人口的70％，但是他们过去没有自由，没有在城市中生活的权利，如果他们企图从他们的教长的土地上逃走的话，他们就会受到惩罚。罚金最终夺去他们的全部收入。在旧政权下，农民们建立了原始的自卫手段。他们决定不把他们之间的纠纷提交教长的法庭去解决。他们设立了特别基金来帮助受到惩罚的农民。
    马哈茂德说，英国人在侵占伊拉克以后，曾经把土地分给教长们，以便赢得他们对帝国主义的支持。这样，伊拉克最好的30％的土地就成为教长的财产，其中有一百个教长占有这30％土地中的三分之二。小土地所有者占有的土地只占全国土地的2％。
    新华社贝鲁特2日电　美国总统的“特使”墨菲今天早晨离开这里前往伊拉克共和国。
    这位美国的阴谋老手在贝鲁特导演了“总统选举”以后，又到约旦和以色列进行了阴谋活动，并且在昨天回到这里。
    美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克今天早晨在宣布墨菲去伊拉克这件事时说，墨菲将会见伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆和其他领导人。
