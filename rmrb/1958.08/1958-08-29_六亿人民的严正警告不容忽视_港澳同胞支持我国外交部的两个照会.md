Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 28th: People from all walks of life in Hong Kong today issued statements, warmly supporting and firmly endorsing the two notes presented by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government yesterday.

The principals of twelve schools including Hong Kong Pui Kiu Middle School, Heung To Middle School, Han Wa Middle School, Xinxiu Middle School, Fujian Middle School, and Hong Kong School of Fine Arts issued statements today regarding the two notes of the Chinese government. Wu Kangmin, Principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, pointed out that the continuous intrusion of British military aircraft into China's airspace is an act of Britain following the United States in creating tension in the Far East. He said that the provocative behavior of the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must be stopped immediately. Huang Chengshun, Principal of Heung To Middle School, said that the Hong Kong authorities' recent series of persecutions against the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon not only exposed its conspiracy to further infringe upon the freedom of our people to run schools, but also exposed its further pursuit of the US imperialist policy of hostility towards our country. The twelve principals unanimously expressed their firm support for the strong protest lodged by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government.

More than fifty representatives from nearly thirty publishing units in Hong Kong held a meeting today and unanimously expressed their support for the protest notes of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Wu Shutong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Chung Hwa Book Company, pointed out at the meeting that while the British authorities in Hong Kong were persecuting the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, they were also condoning the conspiracy activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The essence of these manifestations is to follow US imperialism in carrying out the conspiracy to create so-called "two Chinas." He specifically mentioned the various facts that the Hong Kong publishing industry has been subjected to many obstacles and pickiness by the Hong Kong Education Department when publishing patriotic textbooks. He questioned what the Hong Kong British authorities' intentions were. Chen Zulin, Manager of New Democratic Publishing House, spoke at the meeting in support of the demands made by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the notes. He pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately revoke the regulations regarding the adoption of textbooks published by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Hong Kong and Kowloon schools. One hundred and sixty-one representatives representing more than twenty Hong Kong commercial organizations, including the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the North-South Trading Association, the Chinese Import and Export Chamber of Commerce, and the Fujian Chamber of Commerce, unanimously supported the strong protest lodged by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government at a meeting today.

Chen Pishi, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, pointed out today that the British authorities in Hong Kong must stop their provocative behavior against the Chinese people and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. All teachers, students, and staff of the Chung Wah Middle School, who were persecuted by the Hong Kong authorities, issued a statement today, supporting the two serious protests lodged by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government. The statement firmly opposed Britain's pursuit of US imperialism in creating the "two Chinas" conspiracy. The statement also said that the intrusion of British military aircraft into China's airspace is a provocative action of hostility towards our country, which we absolutely cannot tolerate.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 28th: Macao news: Compatriots in Macao firmly support the two protest notes against the British government issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 27th, and oppose the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of the patriotic education cause of our people and the British military aircraft's intrusion into our airspace.

He Xian, Chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: The Hong Kong authorities are implementing a conspiracy plan to be hostile to China and play with the so-called "two Chinas." On the one hand, it has carried out a series of acts to undermine and persecute the patriotic education cause of the Chinese people, condoning the police to insult Chinese teachers, students, and journalists, infringing on personal safety, and undermining the internationally recognized right of journalists to free interviews; on the other hand, it condones and shields Chiang Kai-shek clique elements in Hong Kong to engage in political activities that undermine our country. He said: The British military aircraft in Hong Kong have repeatedly invaded our country's airspace, following the United States to create a tense atmosphere, which is outrageous. Therefore, we believe that the protest raised by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is completely correct. Macao compatriots firmly support the two protests raised by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and demand that the British government quickly change its attitude of hostility towards China and immediately stop all provocative acts. Ma Wanqi, Vice Chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said that the two serious protests raised by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government represent the will of 600 million compatriots throughout China, including Macao compatriots. At a time when US imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, are creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, British military aircraft in Hong Kong have repeatedly invaded our country's airspace. This is an extremely serious event. We absolutely do not allow the Hong Kong authorities to provoke us at our doorstep.

Liang Pei, Chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, said that the provocative behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong will inevitably arouse the anger of 600 million people in our country. Workers in all industries in Macao fully support the two protests of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He pointed out that the intrusion of British military aircraft in Hong Kong into our country's airspace is inseparable from the act of US imperialism deliberately seeking trouble with our country by creating a tense situation.

Zhang Qinghui, Chairman of the Macao Women's Federation, said: Macao women compatriots unanimously support the protest notes of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All the hostile actions taken by the British authorities in Hong Kong against our country are outrageous. We seriously warn the Hong Kong authorities: The Chinese people are the true masters of Hong Kong.

　　六亿人民的严正警告不容忽视
    港澳同胞支持我国外交部的两个照会
    新华社香港28日电　香港各界人士今日纷纷发表谈话，热烈支持和坚决拥护我国外交部昨天对英国政府提出的两项照会。
    香港培侨中学、香岛中学、汉华中学、信修中学、福建中学、香港美术专科学校等十二所学校的校长，今日分别就我国政府的两个照会发表谈话。培侨中学校长吴康民指出，英国军用飞机连续侵犯我国领空事件，是英国追随美国制造远东紧张局势的行为。他说，英国政府和香港英国当局这种挑衅行为必须立即停止。香岛中学校长黄承燊说，香港当局最近对港九中国人民的爱国教育事业的一连串迫害事件，不仅暴露了它进一步侵犯我国人民办学自由的阴谋，而且暴露了它进一步追随美帝国主义敌视我国的政策。这十二位校长一致表示坚决拥护我国外交部向英国政府提出的强硬抗议。
    香港出版界近三十个单位的代表五十余人，今天举行集会，一致表示支持我国外交部的抗议照会。中华书局董事长吴叔同在会上指出，香港英国当局一方面对港九中国人民的爱国教育事业进行迫害，另一方面却纵容蒋介石集团的阴谋活动，这些表现的实质就是追随美帝国主义进行制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋活动。他特别提到香港出版界在出版爱国教科书时，受到香港教育当局诸多阻挠和挑剔的种种事实。他质问香港英国当局这是何居心？新民主出版社经理陈祖霖在会上发言支持我国外交部在照会中所提的要求，他指出香港英国当局必须立即撤销关于港九学校采用蒋介石集团出版的课本的规定。代表着中华总商会南北行公所、中华出入口商会、福建商会等二十多个香港商业团体的代表一百六十一人在今天的一个集会上，一致支持我国外交部对英国政府提出的严重抗议。
    香港华人革新协会主席陈丕士今天指出，香港英国当局必须停止对中国人民的挑衅行为，保证今后不再发生类似事件。被香港当局迫害的中华中学全体师生员工今天发表声明，拥护我国外交部向英国政府提出的两项严重抗议。这个声明坚决反对英国追随美帝国主义，制造“两个中国”的阴谋。声明还说，英国军用飞机侵入我国领空，更是敌视我国的挑衅行动，这是我们绝对不能容许的。
    新华社广州28日电　澳门消息：澳门同胞坚决拥护我外交部在27日发表的对英国政府的两个抗议照会，反对香港英国当局迫害我国人民的爱国教育事业和英国军机侵犯我国领空。
    澳门中华总商会理事长何贤说：香港当局执行的是敌视中国和玩弄所谓“两个中国”的阴谋计划。它一方面作出一系列摧残和迫害中国人民的爱国教育事业，纵容警察殴辱中国的师生和记者，侵犯人身安全，破坏国际上公认的记者的自由采访权利；另一方面纵容、包庇蒋介石集团分子在香港从事破坏我国的政治活动。他说：香港的英军飞机又屡次侵入我国领空，追随美国制造紧张空气，这是人所公愤的。因此我们认为我国外交部所提的抗议完全是正确的，澳门同胞坚决拥护我外交部提出的两个抗议，要求英国政府迅速改变敌视中国的态度，立刻停止一切挑衅行为。澳门中华总商会副理事长马万祺说，我外交部对英国政府提出的两个严重抗议是代表着全中国六亿同胞，也包括澳门同胞的意志。正当美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石集团在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的时候，香港英国军机屡次侵犯我国领空，这是极其严重的事件，我们绝对不容许香港当局在我国门前的挑衅。
    澳门工会联合总会理事长梁培说，香港英国当局这种挑衅行为，必然引起我国六亿人民的愤怒。澳门各业工人完全拥护我国外交部的两个抗议。他指出，香港英国军机侵犯我国领空，这种作法是同美帝国主义制造紧张局势蓄意向我国寻衅的行为分不开的。
    澳门妇女联合会主席张晴晖说：澳门妇女同胞一致拥护我国外交部的抗议照会。香港英国当局对我国所采取的一切敌视行为都是令人发指的。我们严重警告香港当局：中国人民是香港的真正主人。
