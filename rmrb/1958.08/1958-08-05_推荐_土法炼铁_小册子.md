    Recommendation of "Native Iron Smelting" Booklet
    After the Yingchao Handicraft Iron Production Cooperative in Yangcheng, Shanxi Province, created the native blast furnace lime iron smelting method with low investment and high output this year, various places urgently need technical data on this experience. Recently, the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives and the Handicraft Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry jointly compiled these technical materials into a booklet entitled "Native Iron Smelting," which has now been published by the Light Industry Publishing House. The book introduces in detail the technical equipment, advanced experience, and advantages of the Yingchao Iron Production Cooperative in using native blast furnace lime iron smelting and will soon be available to readers in Xinhua bookstores across the country.
