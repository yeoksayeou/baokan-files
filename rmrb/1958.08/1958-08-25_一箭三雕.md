　　Killing Three Birds with One Stone
　　He Zuo
    When Chairman Mao inspected Tianjin University and other schools, he encouraged teachers to engage in work-study programs and participate in physical labor, not just to talk but to also use their hands. This instruction has profound significance. Many teachers in universities and colleges in Northeast China, Xi'an, and Tianjin have already done so, and the results are very good.

    Only talking without doing, or the separation of teaching and productive labor, and the disconnection of theory and practice, are abominable characteristics of the bourgeois education system and its fatal weaknesses. People trained and educated under this education system, if not ideologically reformed, inevitably look down upon physical labor and the working people; if they become teachers, they will certainly only want to talk and disdain or be incapable of using their hands. In the eyes of those who hold bourgeois educational ideas, closed-door study and the pursuit of "pure theory" are superior; production practice is inferior. However, people with this kind of thinking are truly harming themselves and others in the socialist era! Our education system is fundamentally different from the bourgeois one and must go in the opposite direction. That is, we advocate the combination of education and productive labor, the combination of theory and practice, and we require not only students to do so, but also teachers. Only in this way can we finally get rid of the influence of the bourgeois education system and create favorable conditions for the thorough realization of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

    Since schools implemented work-study programs, students have not only improved their political and ideological awareness but also gained rich perceptual knowledge, greatly improving their level of scientific knowledge. Students apply what teachers have taught in the classroom to practice, and in practice, they realize that the knowledge given by teachers is partly true and partly false, not entirely correct. Students also encounter many problems in production that teachers have not mentioned, and they seek advice from teachers and ask for their guidance. Some teachers are unable to meet the students' requirements; sometimes, students understand and can do things in practice that teachers do not yet understand or cannot do. The situation is pressing, and if teachers still teach and research behind closed doors as they did in the past, they will be unable to cope. More importantly, teachers cannot guide students to implement work-study programs more quickly and implement the combination of theory and practice. Teachers educate students. Educators must first be educated. If teachers want to guide students to become laborers who have both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, and who are capable of both mental and physical work, they must first implement it themselves, lead the way for students, and set an example for students with their own actions.

    Some ideologically rigid "skeptics" and "wait-and-seeers" are unwilling to believe in the benefits of the education system we advocate, which requires both using the brain and the mouth, and using the hands. However, facts are the most eloquent. The results of work-study programs for teachers in Northeast China, Xi'an, and Tianjin are killing three birds with one stone: First, through labor training, teachers have undergone revolutionary changes in their political and ideological work style, gradually cultivating the feelings of the working people and becoming intellectuals of the working class. Second, through labor training, teachers' knowledge has gradually changed from one-sided, rigid, poor, and dogmatic knowledge to comprehensive, lively, rich, and practical knowledge. Third, through labor training, teachers have changed their methods of learning and teaching style, and will more quickly guide students to become culturally educated laborers with socialist consciousness.

    May teachers across the country quickly participate in work-study programs.

　　何作
    毛主席在天津大学等校视察时，勉励教师们要搞勤工俭学，参加体力劳动，不要光动嘴、不动手。这一指示有着深远的意义。东北、西安、天津高等学校的许多教师们已经这样做了，成绩很好。
    光动嘴、不动手，或者说教学、生产劳动脱节，理论与实际脱节，这是资产阶级教育制度的可恶的特征，也是它致命的弱点。在这种教育制度下培养教育出来的人，如果不是经过思想改造，就必然轻视体力劳动和劳动人民；如果为人师表，则一定是只愿动嘴，不屑于或不善于动手。在有资产阶级教育思想的人看来，闭门造车、追求“纯理论”——等而上之；生产实践——等而下之。但是，持有这种思想的人在社会主义时代，真是害人害己！我们的教育制度和资产阶级的根本不同，必须一反其道而行之。那就是主张教育与生产劳动相结合、理论与实际相结合，不光要求学生这样做，也要求老师们这样做。只有如此，才能最后摆脱资产阶级教育制度的影响，为彻底实现技术革命和文化革命创造有利条件。
    学校实行勤工俭学以来，学生们不仅提高了政治思想觉悟，而且获得了丰富的感性知识，大大提高了科学知识水平。学生把教师在课堂讲过的东西，用之于实际，在实践中认识到教师所给予的知识，有真有伪，不尽正确。学生在生产中又遇到许多教师所没有讲到的问题，向教师求教，要求教师指导。有的教师就无法满足学生的要求；有时甚至学生在实践中懂得了并且会作了的事，教师还不懂不会作。形势逼人，教师们如果仍像过去那样关门教书，关门研究，就将无法胜任。更重要的是教师不能引导学生更迅速地贯彻勤工俭学，贯彻理论结合实际。教师是教育学生的。教育者必须先受教育。教师要教导学生成为既有理论知识又有实践经验，能文能武的劳动者，首先就要自己贯彻执行，走在学生前面，以自己的行为做学生的模范。
    一些思想僵化的“怀疑派”和“观潮派”，对我们所主张的既要动脑动嘴、又要动手的教育制度的好处是不肯相信的。但是，事实是最雄辩的。东北、西安、天津的教师们勤工俭学的结果是一箭三雕：第一，通过劳动锻炼，教师们在政治思想作风上起了革命性的变化，逐步培养起劳动人民的感情，成为工人阶级的知识分子。第二，通过劳动锻炼，教师们的知识由片面的、死板的、贫乏的、教条的东西，逐渐成为全面的、活泼的、丰富的和从实际出发的知识。第三，通过劳动锻炼，教师改变了治学方法和教学作风，将更快地引导学生成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    愿全国教师迅速参加勤工俭学。
