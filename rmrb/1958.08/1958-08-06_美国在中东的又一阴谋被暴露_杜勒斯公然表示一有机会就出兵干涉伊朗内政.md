Xinhua News Agency, August 5th, New York Dispatch: The "New York Post" published an article by Robert Allen from Washington in its "Washington Insider" column on July 30th, revealing yet another US conspiracy to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. The article stated that US Secretary of State Dulles had assured the Iranian authorities that if a revolution occurred in Iran, the United States would send troops to Iran to suppress the revolution as long as the Iranian government requested it. Allen said that this guarantee was "very similar" to the guarantee made by the US government to Chamoun of Lebanon.

Allen said that some senators learned about this US guarantee during a meeting with Assistant Secretary of State Rountree. Senator O'Mahoney asked: "If the Shah of Iran faces a revolution, will the United States go to help him save his government?" Rountree replied: "We will go to help him." Allen also said that the new US Ambassador to Tehran, Welles, alluded to this new US guarantee when he recently presented his credentials to the Shah of Iran. He praised Iran as a "valuable ally." This was the first time an American diplomat had used such a term.

Allen said that this adventurous plan by the US government has caused concern among some senators. They are uneasy and alarmed by the dangers contained in this guarantee.

    美国在中东的又一阴谋被暴露
    杜勒斯公然表示一有机会就出兵干涉伊朗内政
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”7月30日在“华盛顿内幕”栏刊载罗伯特·艾伦从华盛顿发出的一篇文章，透露了美国干涉中东国家人民内政的又一个阴谋。这篇文章说，美国国务卿杜勒斯已经向伊朗当局作出保证：如果伊朗发生革命，只要伊朗政府提出请求，美国就会派兵到伊朗去镇压革命。艾伦说，这个保证同美国政府对黎巴嫩的夏蒙作出的保证是“非常相似”的。
    艾伦说，关于美国的这个保证是一些参议员们在同助理国务卿梅康伯的一次会谈中获悉的。参议员奥马洪尼问道：“如果伊朗国王面临一次革命，美国是不是将前去帮助他拯救他的政府？梅康伯回答说：“我们将前去帮助他。艾伦还说，美国新任驻德黑兰大使韦尔斯在他最近向伊朗国王呈递国书的时候暗示了美国的这项新保证。他称赞伊朗是一个“有价值的盟友”。这是一位美国外交家第一次用这样的称呼。
    艾伦说，美国政府的这个冒险计划已经引起了一些参议员的忧虑。他们为这个保证所包含的危险感到不安和惊慌。
