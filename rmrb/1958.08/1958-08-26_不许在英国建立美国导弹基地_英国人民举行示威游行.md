　　Do Not Allow the Establishment of American Missile Bases in Britain
    British People Hold Demonstrations
    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 24th - Several hundred British people today held a march, proceeding from Ely, about sixty miles north of London, to a Royal Air Force construction site near Mildenhall, six miles away, to protest the establishment of American missile bases in Britain. Children also participated in the march, some walking barefoot, some lying in prams or sitting in strollers, marching together with the adults.
    The demonstration was jointly organized by the Cambridge City Labour Party local organization and the Trades Union Council. Labour MPs Anthony Greenwood and Arthur Skeffington, as well as Fire Brigades Union Secretary John Horner, addressed the marchers. In addition, the Colchester local "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament" committee also organized an eight-mile demonstration yesterday. Demonstrators marched to the American Air Force base in Wethersfield, demanding an immediate end to nuclear weapons testing. On that day, demonstrators from Braintree and Essex stayed at the entrance of the American military base all day.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 25th - It was revealed at the "International Rocket Conference" held in Amsterdam that a rocket carrying a hydrogen bomb is scheduled to be transported from the United States to Britain for the first time this week.
    Today's "Daily Express" published a report from Amsterdam by Chapman Pincher saying that the first American missile base, secretly built near Feltwell in Norfolk, eastern England, is now ready to house the sixty-two-foot-long "Thor" missile.
    According to the report, this launch site, surrounded by multiple layers of barbed wire and protected by guard dogs, is scheduled to be officially opened soon, although American scientists are far from satisfied with the "Thor" missile's launch performance to date. From now on, the work of transporting "Thor" missile warheads and equipment will continue until all the missiles (approximately sixty) are in a launch-ready state.

　　不许在英国建立美国导弹基地
    英国人民举行示威游行
    新华社伦敦24日电　好几百个英国人今天举行游行，从伦敦以北大约六十英里的艾莱向六英里以外梅帕耳附近英国皇家空军的一个工地前进，以抗议在英国建立美国导弹基地。孩子们也参加了这次游行，他们有些光着脚走，有些躺在婴儿车或是坐在手推车里，同大人们一起前进。
    这次示威游行是由剑桥城的工党地方组织和工会理事会联合组织的。工党议员安东尼·格林伍德和阿瑟·斯克芬顿以及消防队员工会书记约翰·霍尔纳向游行者讲了话。此外，科尔契斯特地方的“争取裁减核军备运动”委员会也在昨天组织了一次行程长达八英里的示威游行。示威者向威塞斯菲尔德的美国空军基地前进，要求立即停止试验核武器。这一天，来自布瑞特里和埃塞克斯的示威者整天都守在美军基地的入口处。
    据新华社伦敦25日电　在阿姆斯特丹举行的“国际火箭会议”上透露，预定在本周将第一次把一枚载运氢弹的火箭从美国运到英国。
    今天“每日快报”刊载查普曼·平彻尔从阿姆斯特丹发出的一篇报道说，在英格兰东部诺福克的费特维尔附近秘密修建的第一号美国导弹基地，现在已经准备好放置六十二英尺长的“雷神”式导弹。
    根据这篇报道，这个四周有多层铁丝网团团围住并且用警犬加以保护的发射场预定不久就要正式启用，虽然美国科学家们到现在为止对“雷神”式导弹的发射情况还远不能感到满意。从现在开始，运送“雷神”式导弹弹头和装备的工作一直要继续到全部导弹（约六十颗）都处于能够发射的状况时才会结束。
