The sun sets in the west, and the night is vast,
The bell of the people's school rings loud,
Yulan is washing pots and bowls,
The mother-in-law is anxious at the side:
"Daughter-in-law, hurry to school,
Housework and children to mother,
Come back from school and teach me,
Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law help each other to eliminate illiteracy."
            —Anhui, Lu'an

　　婆媳互助扫文盲日落西山夜茫茫，民校钟声响当当，玉兰正在洗锅碗，婆婆一旁急得慌：“媳妇你快上学去，家务孩娃交给娘，放学回来再教我，婆媳互助扫文盲。”
            ——安徽六安
