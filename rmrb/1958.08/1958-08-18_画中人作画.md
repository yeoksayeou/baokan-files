After reading the news of "Shulu Pi County's county-wide muralization," I was excited, moved, and also felt deeply educated.

The peasants have become painters, and tens of thousands of peasants have become painters. Not long ago, they were still illiterate. They also have busy production tasks. What force makes them have to paint? It is this glorious labor, this beautiful life. Faced with this earth-shattering cause, how can they not be excited? There was such a thing, an agricultural cooperative discussed the good prospects after high yields, many people cried, this is happy crying, who could have imagined that in such a short time, life would become so good!

Look, these new-style painters, they hold the labor brush in one hand, and in the map of the motherland, they have crossed out the word "poor" with one stroke, and everywhere there are high-yield records of thousands of kilograms and tens of thousands of kilograms. Their other hand also erased the word "white." Now, they are using the fearless spirit of the Chinese people to paint the most beautiful pictures and create greater miracles. They themselves are the characters in this great painting. We hope that more people in the painting will paint.

　　画中人作画
    看了“束鹿邳县全县壁画化”的消息后，令人兴奋、感动，同时也感到是受了一次深刻的教育。
    农民成了画家，而且是成千上万的农民成了画家。他们在不久以前，还是文盲。他们又有繁忙的生产任务。什么力量使得他们非画不可呢？是这光荣的劳动，是这美丽的生活。面对着这翻天复地的事业，他们怎么不激动呢？有这样一件事，有一个农业合作社讨论丰产后的好光景，许多人都哭了，这是高兴的哭，谁能想得到在这样短的时间内，生活会变得那样好呢！
    请看，这些新型的画家，他们一手拿着劳动大笔，在祖国的地图上一笔勾销了“穷”字，处处在出现几千斤，几万斤的丰产纪录。他们的另一只手又把“白”字抹去了。现在，他们正在用中国人民大无畏的精神，画最美丽的画图，创造更大的奇迹。他们自己就是这伟大画幅中的人物。我们希望更多的画中人来作画。
