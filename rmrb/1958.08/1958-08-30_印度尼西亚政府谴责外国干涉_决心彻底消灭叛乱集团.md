Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 29th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda stated on August 28th while receiving a delegation from the Indonesian Farmers' Front that the Indonesian government and armed forces have drafted a plan to thoroughly eliminate the "Darul Islam" and "Islamic Army" together with the people. Djuanda paid close attention to the specific materials provided by the Farmers' Front regarding the atrocities committed by these armed rebels against the people.

According to materials provided by the Farmers' Front, from 1953 to the first quarter of 1958, the "Islamic Army" in West Java had killed 10,810 people, kidnapped 1,004 people, and burned down 188,000 houses. The people's property losses are estimated at 323 million rupiah.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 28th: The Indonesian Ministry of Information tonight condemned certain foreign countries for continuing to directly or indirectly assist Indonesian rebel groups. In a radio broadcast, the Ministry of Information pointed out that this is an act of interference in Indonesia's internal affairs and called on the Indonesian people to remain vigilant.

The Ministry of Information cited the fact that foreign aid was given to rebel forces by pointing out that before the Indonesian government forces recovered Domohon in North Sulawesi in early August, foreign aircraft had airdropped weapons to help rebels at two air bases, one of which was Tosuka, under the control of rebel remnants.

The Ministry of Information said that foreign aircraft also bombed Bitung Tekma port before August 17th.

The Ministry of Information pointed out that the bases of these foreign aircraft are abroad, because the areas controlled by rebel remnants do not have air bases suitable for heavy aircraft.

The Ministry of Information said that the light and heavy weapons seized in North Sulawesi were all foreign-made, and some of these weapons had never been used by the Indonesian army.

The Ministry of Information pointed out that foreign interference is a long-term threat to Indonesia. It said that some of Indonesia's neighbors are participating in a certain bloc, so it is difficult for Indonesia not to deal with activities that attempt to undermine Indonesia's independent policy.

In addition, the Netherlands is still entrenched in West Irian, using it as a base for attacking Indonesia or supporting harassment activities against Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚政府谴责外国干涉
    决心彻底消灭叛乱集团
    据新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达28日在接见印度尼西亚农民阵线代表团时说，印度尼西亚政府和武装部队已经拟订计划，准备同人民一起彻底消灭“伊斯兰教国运动”和“伊斯兰教军”。朱安达非常注意农民阵线所提供的关于这些武装叛乱分子对人民所干下的暴行的具体材料。
    根据农民阵线提供的材料，从1953年至1958年第一季度，“伊斯兰教军”在西爪哇已经杀害了一万零八百一十人、绑架了一千零四人，烧毁了十八万八千所民房，人民的财产损失据估计达三亿二千三百万盾。
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚情报部今晚谴责某些外国迄今为止仍然一直在直接或间接地帮助印度尼西亚的叛乱集团。情报部在电台上广播时指出这是干涉印度尼西亚的内政的行为，并且号召印度尼西亚人民继续提高警惕。
    情报部引述外国援助叛乱分子的事实说，在8月初印度尼西亚政府军收复北苏拉威西的多莫洪以前，外国飞机曾经空投武器帮助两个空军基地上的叛乱分子，其中一个基地是在叛军残余控制下的托苏卡。
    情报部说，外国飞机在8月17日前还曾经空袭了比东特克马港。
    情报部指出，这些外国飞机的基地在国外，因为叛军残余控制下的地区没有可供重型飞机使用的空军基地。
    情报部说，在北苏拉威西缴获的轻型和重型武器都是外国制造的，其中有些武器是印度尼西亚军队从来未用过的。
    情报部指出外国干涉是对印度尼西亚的长期威胁。它说，印度尼西亚有些邻国参加了某一集团，因此，印度尼西亚很难不去应付企图破坏印度尼西亚独立政策的活动。
    此外，荷兰目前还盘踞在西伊里安，把它当作进攻印度尼西亚或支持对印度尼西亚的窜扰活动的基地。
