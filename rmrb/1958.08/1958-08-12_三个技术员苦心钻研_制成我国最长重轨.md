　　Three Technicians Devote Themselves to Research
　　Produce China's Longest Heavy Rail
    China's first-ever 25-meter-long heavy-duty steel rail has recently been successfully test-rolled at the Anshan Large Rolling Mill. The characteristic of this type of steel rail is that it can save a significant amount of steel. Currently, every kilometer of railway requires eighty 12.5-meter steel rails (160 for two lines), while with 25-meter steel rails, only forty are needed (eighty for two lines). In this way, each kilometer of railway can save the fishplates and bolts used at the joints of steel rails, saving 2.876 tons of steel based on a 50% savings. It can also save railway sleepers. At the same time, laying roads with this type of steel rail can reduce the vibration of trains and the wear rate at the joints of the steel rails.
    This type of heavy-duty steel rail was painstakingly researched and designed by Hou Fengtong, Wang Fuzhong, and Pan Aiguang, three technicians from the Anshan Black Metallurgical Design Institute, in response to the Party's call for industry to combat drought. It was successfully trial-produced with the help of workers from the Large Rolling Mill and has been assessed as fully qualified. (Liaoning Daily)

　　三个技术员苦心钻研
　　制成我国最长重轨
    我国历史上从未有过的二十五公尺长的重型钢轨，最近在鞍山大型轧钢厂试轧成功。这种钢轨的特点是：能节省大量钢材。现在每公里铁路需要十二点五公尺的钢轨八十根（两线一百六十根），用二十五公尺的钢轨只要四十根（两线八十根）。这样每公里的铁路可节省钢轨两端接头处用的鱼尾板和螺栓钉，按节省一半算就是二点八七六吨钢材。还可节约枕木，同时，用这种钢轨铺路可减少火车行走时的震动和钢轨接头处的磨损率。
    这种重型钢轨是鞍山黑色冶金设计院侯凤桐、王复中、潘爱光三个技术员，为响应党提出的工业抗旱号召，苦心钻研设计出来的，由大型轧钢厂职工帮助试制成功，经鉴定质量完全合格。（辽宁日报）
