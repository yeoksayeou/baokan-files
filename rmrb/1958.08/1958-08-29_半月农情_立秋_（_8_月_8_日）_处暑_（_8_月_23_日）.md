　　Half-Month Agricultural Situation
　　"Start of Autumn" (August 8th) - "End of Heat" (August 23rd)
    The autumn planting season is approaching, and many areas are actively carrying out preparatory work, such as deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and seed selection. The acreage sown to wheat by many agricultural cooperatives this year is larger than last year, and the targets for increased production have also been generally raised.

    In order to welcome large-scale autumn plowing, many special districts and counties are actively preparing various deep plowing tools. The Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province plans to convert more than 500 ordinary plows in its twenty-one tractor stations, which can currently only plow 30 centimeters deep, into deep plows capable of plowing 50 to 90 centimeters deep before wheat planting. The Chengde Special District is also preparing to produce 5,000 deep plows before the end of August.

    Since "Start of Autumn," northern regions have generally begun activities to store winter fodder for livestock. On the Hulunbuir grasslands in Inner Mongolia, thousands of people are often busy cutting and storing grass. This year, many areas in Inner Mongolia have adopted machines for grass cutting, reducing the heavy labor of the people. According to experiments in Xilin Gol League, each grass cutter can cut 10,000 catties of grass per day, which is twenty times more efficient than manual grass cutting.

    In the past half-month, many regions have continued to treat the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests as an important activity to ensure a bumper autumn harvest. In the large-scale prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, the use of indigenous pesticides has become more widespread than before. Many agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province are commonly using *Yangjiao Niu* (a plant), *Gangsong* (a pine), croton, and other substances to control the rice stem borer, which is harmful to late rice. In Yidu and Honghu counties, Hubei Province, the masses made more than 100 kinds of indigenous pesticides while encircling and suppressing autumn insects, and more than a dozen effective pesticides were called "all-sweeping" by the masses.

    In Guixian County, Guangxi, vats for making indigenous pesticides have been placed on 100,000 plots of land, so that they can be made and used on demand, and made according to the amount used.

    While strengthening the management of major autumn crops, the vast agricultural cooperatives in northern regions have also actively carried out the manufacture and improvement of autumn harvesting tools. This year, tuber crops in various places are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected. Some agricultural cooperatives in concentrated tuber producing areas have studied specific measures for harvesting sweet potatoes and potatoes this year. Xushui in Hebei and Yanggu in Shandong and other places have developed methods for using plows to harvest sweet potatoes to meet the harvest needs of this year's large sweet potato harvest. The sweet potato harvesting plow manufactured by Jianhua Cooperative in Yanggu County can be pulled by two animals and can harvest 16 mu per day, which is much more efficient than manual digging. In order to increase the amount of dried storage of tubers, many production units have also actively purchased or manufactured slicing and shredding tools.

### 半月农情  “立秋”（8月8日）——“处暑”（8月23日）

　　半月农情
　　“立秋”（8月8日）——“处暑”（8月23日）
    秋种季节就要来到了，许多地区正在积极进行准备工作，如深耕、积肥、调种等。不少地区的农业社今年播麦面积都比去年有所扩大，增产指标也普遍提高。
    为了迎接大规模的秋翻地，不少专区、县正在积极准备各种深翻工具。河北省天津专区二十一个拖拉机站计划在种麦以前把现在只能耕三十公分深的五百多部普通犁，改装成能耕五十到九十公分的深耕犁。承德专区也准备在8月底以前生产出深耕犁五千部。
    “立秋”以后，北方地区普遍开始了储备牲畜冬草的活动。内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上经常有几千人紧张地打草储草。今年内蒙古许多地区打草都采用了机器，减轻了人们的繁重劳动。据锡盟试验，每台打草机每天可打草一万斤，效率比人工打草高二十倍。
    在这半个月里，许多地区继续把防治农作物病虫害作为保证秋季丰收的一项重要活动。在大规模防治病虫害当中，土农药的使用比以前更广泛了。广东很多农业社普遍地利用羊角扭、岗松、巴豆等除治为害晚稻的三化螟。湖北宜都、洪湖两县的群众在围剿秋虫时制成一百多种土农药，有十多种效果好的农药被群众称为“一扫光”。
    广西贵县在十万块田头上放置了制土农药的缸，作到随制随用，用多少制多少。
    北方地区广大农业社在加强大秋作物管理的同时，还积极地进行了制造和改进秋收工具工作。今年各地薯类作物普遍生长良好，丰收在望。薯类集中产区的农业社有些已研究了今年收获甘薯、马铃薯的具体措施。河北徐水、山东阳谷等地都研究出来用犁收刨甘薯的办法，以适应今年甘薯大丰收的收获需要。阳谷县建华社制造的地瓜收刨犁，用两个牲口拉，每天可收刨十六亩，效率比人刨高很多。也有许多生产单位，为了增加薯类的干藏量，还积极购置或制造了切片、刨丝等工具。
