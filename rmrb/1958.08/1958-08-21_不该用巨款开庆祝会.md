　　Should Not Use Huge Sums for Celebrations
    Our factory's workers, with soaring revolutionary fervor, completed the second quarter's production targets ahead of schedule after six days and nights of hard work. This is a good thing. However, because of this achievement, the leaders of our factory spared no expense in using large amounts of public funds to hold celebratory activities.
    On the evening of June 30th, a grand tea party was held, with the purchase of candy alone costing more than 500 yuan. Workers from several workshops ate and drank heartily, reveling until late at night. Later, more than 5,000 yuan was spent on buying many undershirts, one for each person, and the more than 7,000 yuan in bonuses that many people had suggested canceling was also hastily distributed to everyone.
    The Party calls on us to run enterprises diligently and thriftily, but the leaders of our factory indulged in such extravagance and waste simply to celebrate the overfulfillment of quarterly production tasks. This is not right.

　　不该用巨款开庆祝会
    我们厂里的职工，以冲天的革命干劲，经过六昼夜苦战，超额完成了第二季度的各项生产指标，这是件好事。因为有了这点成绩，我们厂的领导同志，就不惜动用巨额公款，举办庆祝活动。
    在6月30日的晚上，举行了一个盛大的茶会，光买糖果就花了五百多元。几个车间的职工大吃大喝，一直欢腾到深夜。后来又花了五千多元买了很多背心，每人发给一件，还把有许多人建议取消的七千多元奖金也急忙地发给了大家。
    党号召我们要勤俭办企业，可是我们厂的领导同志仅仅为了庆祝超额完成季度生产任务，就这样大肆铺张浪费。这是不应该的。
