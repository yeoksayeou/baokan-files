　　Combining Work, Agriculture, and Study
　　Mountain Mine Middle School in Shanjiao Township, Feidong County Cultivates New Socialist People
　　(Our Dispatch) Shanjiao Township in Feidong County, Anhui Province, in order to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production, merged seven private middle schools into a new type of part-work, part-study, and also part-farming mining middle school.
　　The teaching policy of this school is: part-work, part-study, and also part-farming. The students cultivated can be technicians in the mine, and when they return to the agricultural cooperative, they can be laborers who understand agricultural technology. According to this policy, the current teaching and production are arranged as follows: production in the first half of the day, study in the second half of the day. In terms of teaching, five courses are first offered: Chinese, arithmetic, geology, agricultural technology, and political common sense. When conditions permit, physics and chemistry courses will also be offered. In terms of production, it is both industrial and agricultural. Industrial production is mining and iron smelting, and each student can mine half a ton in half a day. In the second half of the year, it is planned to build four small high-furnaces for iron smelting. Agricultural production is cultivating experimental fields for various crops, cultivating orchards, planting vegetables, raising pigs, etc.
　　This mining middle school was established under the following circumstances: First, not long ago, iron ore was discovered in the township, and the township party committee proposed that 57 small blast furnaces need to be built in the township in the second half of the year, and 400,000 tons of ore mined. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer labor from agricultural cooperatives to the mine. Second, the seven private middle schools established by the township this spring, although they were doing well, also had some problems. For example, one school had only one teacher, and the quality of teaching was not very high; it was difficult for students to insist on studying for half a day during the busy farming season; the seven private middle schools were scattered in seven agricultural cooperatives, which made leadership difficult. These private middle schools urgently need to be consolidated and improved. Third, the township will establish 360 small factories this year, and the industrial output value will exceed three times the agricultural output value. The scale of industrial development will be even greater in the next two years, so it is urgently necessary to cultivate a group of industrial and agricultural technical talents. Based on these three aspects, the township party committee decided to move the seven private middle schools to the mine and merge them into a mining middle school.
　　This mining middle school started on July 9th and has 257 students. In addition to the original seven teachers, three part-time instructors were also hired from the geological survey team and the agricultural technology promotion station to teach geology and agricultural knowledge courses. It is also planned to hire several experienced workers and agricultural labor models in mining and iron smelting as part-time instructors. It did not cost the state a single penny to run this school. The school buildings were converted from ancestral halls. They used screen doors and plaques in the ancestral hall to make tables and blackboards. The students opened up the playground themselves and brought their own living and learning supplies.
　　All the school's expenses are completely solved by the students' productive labor, and no subsidies are required from the state or agricultural cooperatives. According to statistics from the end of June to the beginning of August, in 40 days, the students have mined 5,834 tons of ore, worth 145,850 yuan. It is estimated that all the students in the school will produce 20,000 tons of ore in the second half of the year, with an income of 500,000 yuan. In this way, in addition to all the school's expenses being fully resolved, there is also a surplus. Their plan for the distribution of income is: 20% for school construction, 20% for supporting the township's industrial and agricultural production, 20% retained as a production fund, and 40% for various internal expenses of the school. The preliminary plan proposed by the township party committee is: after the teaching building is completed in the second half of this year, the mining middle school will be expanded into a full middle school that is part-work, part-study, and also part-farming. The masses composed a song to praise this school, saying: "Red flowers bloom in Shanjiao Township, the mining middle school is established, the school cultivates all-rounders, both workers and farmers are good talents."

　　亦工亦农亦学
    肥东县山王乡矿山中学培养社会主义新人
    本报讯  安徽省肥东县山王乡为了适应工农业生产的发展，把七所民办中学合并成为一所新型的半工半读、又工又农的矿山中学。
    这所学校的教学方针是：半工半读，又工又农，培养出来的学生在矿山能当技术员，回到农业社可以作懂得农业技术的劳动者。根据这一方针，目前教学和生产是这样安排的：上半天生产，下半天学习。在教学方面，先开语文、算术、地质、农业技术、政治常识等五门课，有条件的时候，还准备开物理、化学课。在生产方面，又工又农。工业生产是开矿、炼铁，每个学生半天可以开采半吨。下半年准备建筑四座炼铁小高炉。农业生产是培植各种农作物的试验田，培养果园、种植蔬菜、养猪等。
    这个矿山中学是在这样的情况下办起来的：一、不久以前，这个乡境内发现了铁矿，乡党委提出下半年全乡需建五十七个小高炉，开采矿石四十万吨，因此，要从农业社调劳动力去矿山。二、这个乡今年春天创办的七所民办中学，虽然办得很好，但也存在一些问题。如一校只有一个教师，教学质量不太高；农忙时学生坚持半天学习有困难；七所民办中学分散在七个农业社，领导有困难。这些民办中学急需巩固与提高。三、这个乡今年要办小型工厂三百六十个，工业产值将超过农业产值三倍，明后年工业发展规模将更大，因此，急需要培养一批工农业技术人才。乡党委根据这三方面情况，决定把七所民办中学搬上矿山，合并成一个矿山中学。
    这个矿山中学已于7月9日开学，有学生二百五十七人，除原来七名教师外，又从地质勘察队和农业技术推广站聘请三名兼职教员，教授地质和农业知识课，还准备聘请几位对开矿、炼铁有经验的工人和农业劳动模范作兼职教员。办这所学校没有花国家一分钱。学校的校舍是由祠堂改建成的，他们用祠堂里的屏门格扇和匾做桌子和黑板。学生自己开辟了操场，自己带来生活和学习用具。
    学校的一切经费完全由学生生产劳动解决，不要国家和农业社补助。据6月底到8月初四十天统计，学生已开采矿石五千八百三十四吨，价值十四万五千八百五十元。估计全校学生下半年将生产两万吨矿石，收入五十万元。这样，除学校的一切费用可以全部解决外，还有剩余。他们对收入的分配计划是：20％用于建校，20％用于支援全乡工农业生产，20％留作生产基金，40％用于学校内部各项费用。乡党委提出的初步规划是：今年下半年教学大楼建成后，矿山中学将扩大成一所半工半读、又工又农的完全中学。群众编歌赞扬这所学校说：“山王乡红花开，矿山中学办起来，学校培养多面手，又工又农好人才。”（附图片）
