The Strongest Voice for Peace
任晦

    August 3, 1958, will be a day forever remembered in human history. Two giants used solemn and powerful voices to warn the warmongers: "Stop, or you will be completely wiped out!"

    It was an extraordinary Sunday afternoon. The ears of the whole world were listening to the voices of Beijing and Moscow. Like the sun warming the earth, like sweet rain nourishing the hearts, the strongest voice of peace resounded throughout the world, a voice that cannot be blocked or embargoed. The old-line imperialist news agency bosses hurriedly returned to their offices from the seaside resorts and immediately telegraphed all reporters, canceling vacations and using every means to collect reactions and estimate possible impacts. On this midsummer night, Eisenhower, Dulles, and Macmillan are probably going to have sleepless nights again. As for Hussein, Chamoun, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee...they must be trembling with their tails between their legs. Yesterday, foreign telegrams said that Hussein intended to sell his "throne" for ten million pounds. It seems that the price of this "throne" is also going to "plummet" like stocks on Wall Street.

    From Eisenhower and Dulles to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, all these people whom Lippmann called "people born in the wrong era," are still stubbornly clinging to a subjective desire, fantasizing about finding a tiny gap between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union that they can exploit. They fabricate rumors, create atmospheres, and even pray to God, hoping that the "almighty Lord" can give them such an opportunity. But now, this communiqué has completely shattered their subjective wishes. The sacred unity between our two great nations is more solid than a rock and stronger than steel. Do madmen and dwarfs dare to touch it?

    We have always advocated reasoning and sitting down for negotiations. However, for those "people born in the wrong era," for those who live in the sixties of the twentieth century but still stubbornly believe in the so-called "gunboat policy" and "big stick policy," it seems that in addition to demanding negotiations, some necessary measures are also needed. I think that warmongers, no matter how stupid, should understand the weight of the phrase "reached a complete agreement on the measures to be taken against aggression and to safeguard peace" in the communiqué. Understanding the weight of this sentence will make them think about the consequences of their madness. Okay, if you don't want to sit down and talk, then lie down and think about it on this sleepless night.

    The loudspeakers on the street are repeatedly broadcasting the full text of the communiqué, and the residents of the street are happily holding cool-off discussion meetings. I am imagining what an exciting and emotional summer night this will be in Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad...

　August 3, late at night

    和平的最强音
    任晦
    1958年8月3日，将成为人类历史上永远被记起的日子。两个巨人用庄严而有力的声音警告战争贩子：“住手，否则你们就会被彻底地消灭！”
    这是一个不平凡的星期日下午。全世界的耳朵在倾听北京和莫斯科的声音。像太阳的温暖大地，像甘霖的滋润人心，和平的最强音响彻了整个世界，这声音是不能封锁和禁运的。老牌帝国主义的通讯社老板匆匆忙忙地从海滨浴场赶回办公室，立刻发电报给所有的记者，取消休假，用尽一切方法，搜集反应，估计可能发生的影响。在这个仲夏之夜，艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、麦克米伦恐怕又要失眠的了。侯赛因、夏蒙、蒋介石、李承晚……呢，一定是夹着尾巴在发抖了。昨天外国电讯说，侯赛因打算以一千万英镑的代价出卖他的“王位”，看来，这“王位”的价格也要像华尔街的股票一样地“猛泻”了。
    从艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯一直到蒋介石、李承晚，所有这些李普曼称之为“生错了时代的人”，老是不死心地怀抱着一个主观主义的愿望，幻想在中国和苏联这两个伟大国家之间发见一丝一毫可以让他们钻的空子，他们造谣说谎，制造空气，乃至祷告上帝，希望“万能的主”能够给他们这样一个机会，而现在，这个公报使他们的主观愿望彻底地破灭了。我们两大国家之间的神圣的团结比磐石还要巩固，比钢还要坚强，疯子和侏儒们敢来碰一碰么？
    我们一直主张说理，主张坐下来谈判，可是对于那些“生错了时代的人”，对于生活在二十世纪的六十年代而一直还迷信着什么“炮舰政策”、“大棒政策”的徒辈，看起来，除去要求谈判之外，也还得有一些必要的措施。我想，战争贩子们尽管愚蠢，总应该会懂得公报中所说的“对于反对侵略和维护和平所应采取的措施达成了完全一致的协议”这一句话的份量吧。懂得这句话的份量，就会想到发疯的后果。好吧，不愿意坐下来谈，那么在这个失眠之夜，请你们躺下来想一想吧。
    街边的扩音机反复地在转播公报的全文，街道居民兴高彩烈地开起纳凉座谈会来了。我在遐想，在开罗、大马士革、巴格达，……这将是怎样一个兴奋和激动的夏夜啊。　8月3日深夜
