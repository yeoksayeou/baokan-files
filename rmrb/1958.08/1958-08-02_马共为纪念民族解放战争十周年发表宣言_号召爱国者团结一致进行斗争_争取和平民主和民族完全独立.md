Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, 1st Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party issued a declaration on June 20 commemorating the tenth anniversary of the National Liberation War. The declaration demands that the Government of the Federation of Malaya change its current policies that violate the interests of the people. It also calls on all nationalities, strata, patriotic parties, and all patriots in Malaya, including patriots within the ruling MCA-MIC Alliance, to unite with the Malayan Communist Party to strive for the realization of complete national independence, democracy, and peace.

The declaration states that on June 20, 1948, British imperialists, intending to extinguish the flames of the Malayan revolution in one fell swoop, launched an anti-people colonial war in Malaya. However, the people of Malaya were not intimidated by the brutal violence. On the contrary, under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party, they took up arms and gave the bloodthirsty imperialists a merciless counterattack.

The declaration states that although the British colonialists mobilized over 400,000 troops, used inhuman methods of warfare ranging from bombing and burning to chemical warfare, adopted vicious policies ranging from forced relocation and collective punishment to food control aimed at starving the Malayan National Liberation Army, and employed all kinds of fascist terror tactics ranging from imprisonment and deportation to torture and hanging, the Malayan National Liberation Army, supported by the broad masses of the people, was not eliminated. Their long-term armed resistance greatly encouraged the people of the whole country, thereby powerfully promoting various forms of struggle against colonial rule.

The declaration states that it should be pointed out that the declaration of independence of the Federation of Malaya in August 1957 was mainly the result of the long-term armed struggle led by the Malayan Communist Party. This brand-new page in Malayan history was written in blood by tens of thousands of national heroes.

The declaration states that it is necessary to refute the cliché that the independence of the Federation of Malaya was obtained through negotiations, and that this is an example of winning independence through non-violent struggle. The purpose of some people who spread this absurd argument is nothing more than to obliterate the contributions of the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army to the struggle for independence, and to enjoy the fruits of the long and arduous struggle of the people of all ethnic groups.

The declaration says: Facts speak louder than sophistry: Without the guerrillas fighting one after another, without the universal anti-colonial struggle in various forms by the whole people, "independence" would only be an empty promise that the imperialists would never fulfill.

The declaration states that the declaration of independence of the Federation of Malaya provided favorable conditions for restoring domestic peace in Malaya. The Malayan Communist Party has also repeatedly stated that it is ready to reopen negotiations with the MCA-MIC Alliance government at any time on a fair and reasonable basis. If the Alliance government respects public opinion and fulfills its promise to end the state of emergency peacefully, then the colonial war launched by the British colonialists ten years ago could be stopped, and domestic peace could be quickly realized. The struggle of Malaya for complete national independence will also enter a new stage with the great unity of the people of all nationalities and strata in the country. The declaration says that, however, the Alliance government has responded to the Malayan Communist Party's sincerity in seeking peace with intensified military and political offensives.

The declaration accuses the MCA-MIC Alliance government of continuing the anti-communist and anti-people war, and points out that the war originally directly waged by the British colonialists is now being continued through the hands of the Alliance government.

The declaration states that therefore, the armed resistance currently being carried out by the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya is not only for the realization of domestic peace and democracy, but also for opposing colonialism and striving for national liberation. The declaration accuses the MCA-MIC Alliance government of signing a so-called "Joint Defense" agreement with Britain, which allows Britain to retain the privilege of stationing troops and establishing military bases in Malaya, and accuses the Alliance government of not implementing an independent and peaceful neutral foreign policy.

The declaration also accuses the Alliance government of failing to guarantee the people's democratic freedoms, failing to implement policies to protect and develop the national economy and improve the people's lives, and failing to implement policies of national equality and mutual assistance, as well as supporting and developing national culture and education. The declaration also accuses the Alliance government of repeatedly delaying the implementation of Malayanization in government departments, and of taking measures that hinder the unification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.

The declaration states that all these regressive policies pursued by the Alliance government have already produced serious consequences. In order to maintain huge war expenditures, the people's burdens have increased, coupled with the closure of tin mines and the continuous decline in rubber prices, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and the lives of the masses are becoming increasingly impoverished. The declaration demands that the Alliance government abandon policies that violate the interests of the people. The declaration states that the Alliance government should immediately convene a national consultative conference attended by representatives from all parties and sectors, including the Malayan Communist Party, to jointly discuss national affairs and formulate new policies to unite the strength of the people of the whole country and jointly strive for complete national independence and national construction.

The declaration calls on the people of all nationalities and strata in Malaya to carry forward their glorious traditions and continue to vigorously support the Malayan National Liberation Army, and calls on the entire army of the Liberation Army to unite as one, persist in the struggle, and defeat the military and political offensives of the Alliance government.

The declaration states that today, the international situation has undergone fundamental changes. The strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism far exceeds that of the camp of imperialism. The tide of national liberation movements of oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas is rising. Under the favorable situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the just struggle of the Malayan people will surely achieve final victory.

    马共为纪念民族解放战争十周年发表宣言
    号召爱国者团结一致进行斗争  争取和平民主和民族完全独立
    新华社1日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚共产党中央委员会在6月20日发表了纪念民族解放战争十周年的宣言，要求马来亚联合邦政府改变它的违反人民利益的现行政策，并且号召马来亚各民族、各阶层、各爱国党派和全体爱国人士，包括执政党马华印联盟内部的爱国者，团结起来，同马来亚共产党一道，为实现民族完全独立、民主、和平而奋斗。
    宣言说，1948年6月20日，蓄意一举扑灭马来亚革命火焰的英国帝国主义者在马来亚发动了反人民的殖民战争。但是，马来亚人民并没有被蛮横的暴力吓倒，相反地，他们在马来亚共产党的领导下，纷纷拿起了武器，给予嗜血成性的帝国主义者以无情的反击。
    宣言说，尽管英国殖民者动员了数达四十万人以上的兵力和运用了从轰炸、烧杀到化学战等惨无人道的作战方法，采取了从强迫搬家、集体惩罚到图谋饿毙马来亚民族解放军的粮食管制等毒辣政策，使用了从监禁、驱逐出境到酷打、绞刑等各种法西斯恐怖手段，然而，得到广大人民拥护和支持的马来亚民族解放军并没有被消灭。他们所坚持的长期武装抵抗大大鼓舞了全国人民，从而有力地推动了各种形式的反对殖民主义统治的斗争。
    宣言说，应该指出，1957年8月马来亚联合邦的宣告独立，主要是马来亚共产党领导的长期武装斗争的成果。马来亚历史上这崭新的一页是成千上万的民族英雄用鲜血写成的。
    宣言说，必须驳斥这样一种陈腔滥调，说什么马来亚联合邦的独立是依靠谈判得来的，说这是通过不流血斗争赢得独立的范例。散播这种荒谬论调的一些人，其目的无非是想抹煞马来亚共产党和马来亚民族解放军为独立而斗争的功绩，坐享各族人民长期艰苦奋斗所获得的果实。
    宣言说：事实胜于诡辩：如果没有游击战士们前仆后继地战斗，如果没有全民普遍进行各种形式的反殖民主义斗争，“独立”将只是帝国主义者永远不予兑现的诺言而已。
    宣言说，马来亚联合邦的宣告独立对恢复马来亚国内和平提供了有利条件。马来亚共产党也一再声明随时准备在公平合理的基础上同马华印联盟政府重开谈判。如果联盟政府尊重民意，履行其以和平方式结束紧急状态的诺言，则十年前由英国殖民主义者发动起来的殖民战争就有可能停止，国内和平就有可能迅速实现。马来亚争取民族完全独立的斗争也就会随着国内各民族、各阶层人民的大团结而进入一个新的阶段。宣言说，然而，联盟政府却以加紧军事和政治攻势来回答马来亚共产党致力和平的诚意。
    宣言指责马华印联盟政府继续进行反共、反人民的战争，并指出，原来由英国殖民主义者直接进行的战争现在则假借联盟政府之手来延续下去。
    宣言说，因此，马来亚各族人民目前还在进行着的武装抵抗，不仅仅是为了实现国内和平和民主，而且仍然是为了反对殖民主义，争取民族的解放。宣言指责马华印联盟政府同英国签订所谓“联防”协定，使得英国保留在马来亚驻扎军队和建立军事基地的特权，并且指责联盟政府不实行独立自主与和平中立的外交政策。
    宣言还指责联盟政府未保障人民的民主自由，不实行保护和发展民族经济和改善人民生活的政策，不实行民族平等互助以及扶助和发展民族文化教育事业的政策。宣言还指责联盟政府一再拖延实行政府部门马来亚化，并且采取妨碍新加坡同马来亚联合邦的统一的措施。
    宣言说，联盟政府所推行的这一切倒退政策已经产生了严重的后果。为了维持浩大的战费，人民负担加重，加之锡矿纷纷倒闭，胶价一跌再跌，失业人数日益增多，人民群众的生活也越来越贫困化。宣言要求联盟政府放弃违反人民利益的政策。宣言说，联盟政府应该立即召开由包括马来亚共产党在内的各党派、各界代表参加的全国协商会议，共商国是，制定新的政策，以团结全国人民的力量，共同争取民族完全独立和建设祖国。
    宣言号召马来亚各民族、各阶层人民发挥历来的光荣传统，继续大力支援马来亚民族解放军，并且号召解放军全军团结一致，坚持斗争，击败联盟政府的军事和政治进攻。
    宣言说，今天，国际形势已经发生根本的变化。和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量大大超过了帝国主义阵营的力量。亚洲、非洲和美洲各被压迫民族的民族解放运动的浪潮日益增涨。在东风压倒西风的有利形势下，马来亚人民的正义斗争也必定会获得最后胜利。
