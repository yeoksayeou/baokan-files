Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 26th: Hong Kong News: Today, more than 4,000 representatives from many schools in Hong Kong, including teachers and students, as well as representatives from labor unions, publishing circles, the press, the film industry, the financial and trade sectors, and social organizations, went to the Chinese Middle School to express their sympathy and concern for the teachers and students who were injured by the Hong Kong British police. At noon, they jointly held an accusation meeting with all the teachers and students of the Chinese Middle School to protest the Hong Kong authorities' act of using force to forcibly close the Chinese Middle School, brutally beating teachers and students, and insulting journalists who were present to cover the event, creating a bloody incident.

　　Huang Zufen, the principal of the Chinese Middle School, reported on the course of the incident and said that the Hong Kong British authorities' act of closing the school in the dark and using violence to beat people was an extremely barbaric act, but no means of persecution can intimidate us. Principal Huang, on behalf of all the teachers and students, expressed to the representatives who came to express their condolences: We must insist on building the school building and insist on patriotic education. Deng Tongyuan, a teacher who was beaten and injured by the British police, accused at the meeting: "I want to seriously protest the Hong Kong British authorities' use of barbaric actions to deal with our unarmed teachers and students. They can use force to close the school, and they can use violence to hurt our bodies, but they cannot destroy our strong will."
　　Yang Yuqing, a female student from the first grade, revealed that the Hong Kong British police twisted her arm behind her back, pushed her down, and continued to beat her. She accused: "We will never bow to this kind of violence."
　　Huang Chengshun, representative of the Hong Kong education sector and principal of Xiangdao Middle School, said: We absolutely cannot tolerate this act of violence by the Hong Kong British authorities. The Hong Kong education sector will fully support the anti-persecution struggle of the Chinese Middle School and support them to continue running the school.
　　Representatives from all walks of life spoke at the accusation meeting. They unanimously believed that the incident of British police beating teachers and students of the Chinese Middle School and Chinese journalists showed that the Hong Kong British authorities' hostility towards the Chinese people had reached an extremely rampant and serious level. Worker representatives said that Hong Kong workers would come to the school for voluntary labor to build school buildings for the school. Representatives from the business community said they would donate money to build school buildings. Many students' parents encouraged their children to take better care of the Chinese Middle School. Students from English schools such as the University of Hong Kong, King's College, St. Joseph's College, New Method College, and Wellington College, who participated in the accusation meeting, also expressed their support for the anti-persecution struggle of the Chinese Middle School.
　　This afternoon, the Chinese Middle School also issued a statement on the incident, exposing the truth of the Hong Kong British authorities' assault to the Hong Kong community. The statement said: We angrily protest the Hong Kong British authorities' act of forcibly closing our school building with violence and beating our unarmed staff, students, and workers.
　　The statement pointed out that we insist on demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately allow our school to build school buildings. Our request is reasonable, and the vast majority of Chinese compatriots support us. No violence can intimidate us.
　　The statement made two requests to the Hong Kong British authorities: (1) Immediately instruct the Public Works Bureau to approve the construction drawings of our school that have been accepted and allow construction to begin immediately; (2) Must take responsibility for recovering our school's lost property and punishing the perpetrators. The statement concluded by saying that we will insist on the struggle for the school building issue, and we will never give up until the incident is resolved reasonably.
