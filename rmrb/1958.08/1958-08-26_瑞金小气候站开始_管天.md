　　Ruijin Microclimate Station Begins to "Manage the Sky"
    (According to Jiangxi Daily news) The Ruijin County Climate Station broke superstitions and liberated its thinking, successfully carrying out weather forecasting work with an accuracy rate of 94%. This powerfully refuted the argument that "climate stations cannot manage the sky" and pushed the work of Jiangxi Province's climate stations to a new stage.
    The Ruijin County Climate Station had only been established for a little over half a year. The entire station had only three people, and the equipment consisted of ordinary wind direction and speed indicators, a small louvered box, a rain gauge, and an evaporation pan. Initially, constrained by various "condition theories" and "difficulty theories," this climate station could only follow conventional practices, merely responsible for accumulating local meteorological data and providing meteorological observatories with necessary reference data. However, since the winter and spring of last year, they witnessed the Great Leap Forward everywhere. In particular, the Party Central Committee put forward the call to break superstitions, liberate thinking, and advocate the establishment of a communist style of daring to think, speak, do, and act. They were greatly inspired and encouraged. After repeated research and discussions, they boldly formulated a plan for experimental weather forecasting.
    Starting in mid-June, the Ruijin Climate Station began its weather forecasting experiments. However, due to insufficient familiarity with the terrain and failure to grasp the general laws of summer climate change, the forecasts were not accurate enough and suffered repeated failures. But they did not waver or become discouraged in the slightest, and continued to actively conduct research. In order to solve many difficulties such as insufficient equipment and manpower, they used radios to listen to weather patterns in neighboring provinces and regions, and designed their own "weather analysis chart," using codes to plot the listening situation on the chart for reference. Based on the meteorological changes and wind direction and speed changes in various places, they analyzed and judged the weather within the scope of their station. At the same time, they strengthened visual observation items and brought the role of existing simple equipment into play. In order to become familiar with the local terrain and grasp the changes in seasons, they also went deep into the countryside to conduct interviews, collected a large amount of information and data, and drew a map of the entire county's terrain. Because they learned many experiences in practice and grasped the laws of climate change, they ensured the high accuracy of weather forecasts and received great praise from the local people.

### 瑞金小气候站开始“管天”

　　瑞金小气候站开始“管天”
    据江西日报消息：瑞金县气候站破除迷信、解放思想，成功地进行了天气预报工作，准确率达到94％，有力地批驳了认为“气候站不能管天”的论调，把江西省气候站的工作推上一个新的阶段。
    瑞金县气候站建站仅半年多时间，全站一共只有三个人，设备除了普通的风向风速器、小百页箱、雨量器、蒸发皿之外，什么仪器也没有。起先，在种种“条件论”、“困难论”的束缚下，这个气候站也只能按常规办事，仅仅负责积累当地气象资料和供给气象台必要的观察气象的参考资料的工作。但是自去冬今春以来，他们亲眼看到到处都在大跃进，特别是党中央提出了要打破迷信，解放思想，提倡树立敢想敢说敢做敢为的共产主义风格的号召，他们受到更大的启发和鼓舞，大家经过多次的研究、讨论，大胆地制出了试验天气预报的计划。
    从6月中旬开始，瑞金气候站就开始了天气预报的试验，但由于对地形不够熟悉，又没有掌握住夏季气候变化的一般规律，因此预报得不够准确，曾一再遭受失败，但他们丝毫也没有动摇、气馁，仍然积极地进行研究。为了解决设备和人力不足的许多困难，他们利用收音机收听各邻近省区的天气形势，自己设计了“天气分析图”，将收听情况用代号点绘图上作参考，根据各地气象和风向、风速的变化，分析和判断本站所属范围的气象。同时加强了目测项目、发挥了现有简陋设备的作用。为求熟悉当地地形和掌握季节的变化，他们还分别深入农村进行访问，收集了大量的情况和资料，并绘制了全县地形图。由于在实践中摸出了许多经验，掌握了气候变化的规律，保证了天气预报的高度准确性，受到了当地群众的极大赞扬。
