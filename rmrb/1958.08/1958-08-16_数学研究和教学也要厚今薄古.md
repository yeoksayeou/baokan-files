Mathematical Research and Teaching Should Also Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past
Guan Zhaozhi

Does a problem of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present exist in mathematical research and teaching? I believe it does, and the situation is serious.

Because mathematics is the science of studying the quantitative relationships in the real world, it plays an indispensable role in all kinds of human production practices, and therefore it is an important component of education at all levels. However, if we carefully study the current situation of mathematics education in primary and secondary schools, we will find that the mathematical knowledge taught by teachers is all the legacy of people before the seventeenth century. For example, the "Plane Geometry" and "Solid Geometry" textbooks currently used are basically adaptations of Euclid's "Elements" written two thousand years ago. As for what is learned in university mathematics majors, although it is modern knowledge, it is basically nineteenth-century mathematics. People often have the misconception that "new" must be "difficult." In reality, this is conservative thinking. Most people feel that modern mathematical literature is unattainable. If you want to make some creative achievements in mathematical research, you must first go through a long "preparation" path. This undoubtedly greatly hinders the development of mathematics and also has an adverse effect on the development of related natural sciences and technologies.

In mathematical research work, due to the existence of the idea of ​​emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, many problems currently being studied in the modern mathematical world are "classic," that is, they have existed for more than a hundred years; however, because these problems are difficult, they have not been solved or have not been completely solved. Of course, these classic problems are often indeed very important, but some of them have become just the interest of a small circle of mathematicians, and their solution does not have much impact on the development of mathematics as a whole or even on other sciences and technologies. Some people believe that since these problems have not been solved for hundreds of years, extremely "profound" tools are needed, so researching them will promote the progress of mathematics, and practical value will be discovered in the future. This statement naturally has some truth, but it also has a certain one-sidedness. In fact, if we ignore the large number of realistic mathematical problems raised in socialist construction and in various sciences and technologies, and focus the main energy of most people on those problems left over from hundreds of years ago that currently have no discernible significance in solving them, it would be unjustifiable! As for "profound," if it is divorced from the significance to production practice and other sciences and technologies, then it is unreasonable. If solving mathematical problems is simply regarded as a brain-wracking intelligence test, it loses its significance as a science and is at most just an intellectual game. Along with this so-called "profound" view, some people also believe that some new branches of mathematics that have emerged in the past ten or more years from the needs of production practice and national defense—such as "mathematical information theory," "game theory," mathematical methods in public utilities, and "linear programming theory"—are still relatively "superficial" and cannot be considered important work in mathematics. This includes two problems: First, new things are naturally immature, but they are growing things; second, if they provide methods for solving many (not individual) practical problems, then they cannot be called "superficial." In fact, many new branches in mathematics are very immature when they first come out. For example, the "operator method" (formerly known as "operational calculus") was originally generated by practical needs, and it lacked rigorous theoretical basis, but later many mathematical theories arranged a theoretical foundation for it. In recent years, it has become a part of "functional analysis" and has a rigorous basis. Another example is that many problems appearing in mathematical methods in public utilities not only have huge practical value, but are also very complicated in theory, and their research will inevitably drive the development of "probability theory."

In the past, discussions in the mathematical community on the direction of development always considered the classification of mathematical disciplines—mathematics is divided into "number theory," "algebra," "geometry," "topology," "function theory," "functional analysis," "differential equation theory," "probability theory," "mathematical statistics," "computational mathematics," "mathematical logic," and other branches, and several problems worthy of continued research are proposed according to the directions that have been formed in the past, and they are done generation after generation with peace of mind. However, on the basis of breaking superstition and emancipating the mind, all research work has encountered such a problem: what is the purpose? Of course, purpose includes practical and theoretical significance, and theory also serves practice. Under the clear purpose that scientific research must serve socialist construction, our research direction should break through the framework of discipline classification formed historically for many years, advocate using tasks to drive disciplines, and organize scholars from different branches to engage in the research of major comprehensive mathematical problems proposed by production practice or various sciences and technologies. Take such task-oriented problems as the warp and the discipline system as the weft, and form a system of interwoven warp and weft in mathematics.

The consideration of the direction of mathematical development also forces us to boldly reform mathematics education at all levels. We do not need, nor should we, retain in mathematics education the traces of the entire journey that mathematics has taken in its history, that is to say, it is not necessary or should we let young people who study mathematics replay in their minds the entire thinking and creative process of our ancestors in mathematics for thousands of years. For the parts that have naturally developed into a higher stage in history and become part of another discipline, its original form should be basically eliminated from mathematics teaching, retaining only its basic conceptual part, and making time for the new disciplines that have formed in its history. In this way, some parts of arithmetic (including word problems, etc.) can be replaced by algebra, and plane geometry can also be greatly simplified except for the part that focuses on cultivating students' spatial concepts (many of which can be replaced by "formal logic" courses), making way for trigonometry, analytic geometry, and even elementary parts of set theory, etc. The elementary parts of analytic geometry and differential and integral calculus should become common sense for all people with secondary education in the second half of the twentieth century, so that they can better understand the quantitative aspects of various processes in the objective world. Some new branches of mathematics that are closely related to new technologies or various practical applications—such as "game theory," "outline of information theory," etc.—can also be appropriately placed in secondary mathematics education. After the modernization of secondary mathematics education, higher mathematics education can also be changed accordingly. It is necessary to break the current situation where many senior students majoring in mathematics cannot read the latest mathematical literature (because they lack "modern language" and only know things before the nineteenth century). In short, we should constantly reform mathematics education according to the latest development of mathematics and the needs of the development of natural science and technology, so as to teach the latest and most useful mathematical knowledge to the younger generation in the fastest way.

In mathematics teaching, and even when compiling mathematics books and writing papers, we should break the purely deductive form that has been popular in recent decades—this rigid form conceals the actual thinking process of mathematicians in discovering mathematical truths, and even reverses this process to tell others. How to extract mathematical problems from natural phenomena and engineering technology problems, induce mathematical concepts and theorems from the discussion of these problems, give rigorous proofs to these theorems, explain the actual meaning of the deduced results, and how to calculate numerical results and use them to solve practical problems, we must teach this entire process to students and tell readers.

Let us give full play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and implement the spirit of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past into every corner of mathematical research and teaching work!

　　数学研究和教学也要厚今薄古
　　关肇直
    在数学的研究和教学中是否存在着厚古薄今的问题？我认为存在着，而且情况是严重的。
    由于数学是研究现实世界中的量的关系的科学，它在人类的各种生产实践活动中都起着不可缺少的作用，因而它是各级教育中的重要组成部分。但是，如果仔细研究一下目前中小学数学教育的情况就会发现，教师们所传授的数学知识都是十七世纪以前的人留下的遗产。例如目前所用的“平面几何”和“立体几何”教本基本上是两千几百年前的欧几里得所著的
  “几何原本”的改编本。至于高等学校数学专业所学的，虽然是近代知识，也基本上是十九世纪的数学。往往人们有一种错觉，以为“新的”必是“难的”。实际上这是保守思想。大多数人感到现代数学文献是高不可攀的。要想在数学研究工作中做出些创造性的成果来，就要先走过漫长的“准备”道路。这无疑对数学的发展起着很大的阻碍作用，对于有关的自然科学和技术的发展也有不利的影响。
    在数学研究工作中由于存在着厚古薄今的思想，现代数学界正在研究着的很多问题都是“经典性的”，即存在了百年以上的；可是由于这些问题困难，一直没有得到解决或没有彻底解决。固然，这种经典性问题往往确实是非常重要的，但其中也有一些变成了只是少数数学家的狭小圈子的兴趣，它的解决对整个数学的发展乃至对其它科学技术没有多大影响。有人认为这些问题既然几百年来没得到解决，需要用极为“精深”的工具，因此对它进行研究将会推动数学的进展，将来会发现它的实用价值。这种说法自然有一定理由，但也有一定的片面性。实际上，如果我们对在社会主义建设中、在各种科学技术中提出的大量现实的数学问题置之不理，而把大多数人的主要精力放在那些几百年前遗留下来的、而目前又看不出解决它的意义的问题上，无论如何总是说不过去吧！至于“精深”，如果脱离了对生产实际、对于其它科学技术的意义，也就没有什么道理了。如果把解决数学问题单纯看成是绞人脑汁的智力测验，就失去了它作为一门科学的意义，至多不过是一种智力游戏而已。与有这种所谓“精深”的看法的同时，也有人认为近十多年来从生产实际和国防需要产生的一些数学新分支——如“数理信息论”、“游戏论”（或称“博奕论”）、公众事业中的数学方法、“线性规划论”等——还是比较“肤浅的”，不能算是数学中的重要工作。这里包括两种问题：第一，新鲜的事物自然是不成熟的，但它是正在成长的东西；第二，如果它提供了解决很多（不是个别）实际问题的方法，那么也就不能称之为“肤浅”。实际上，数学中很多新分支在它刚出世时都是很不成熟的，例如“算子方法”（旧称“运算微积”）本来是由实用需要产生的，它缺乏严谨的理论根据，但后来则有很多数学理论为它安排了理论基础，近年来它已经成为“泛函分析”的一个部分，具有严谨的根据了。又如公众事业中的数学方法上出现的很多问题，不仅具有巨大的实用价值，而且在理论上也是很不简单的，它的研究必将带动“概率论”理论的发展。
    过去数学界讨论发展方向，总是从数学的学科分类考虑——数学分成“数论”、“代数学”、“几何学”、“拓扑学”、“函数论”、“泛函分析”、“微分方程论”、“概率论”、“数理统计”、“计算数学”、“数理逻辑”等分支，并按过去已经形成的方向提出若干值得继续研究的问题，就一代一代地做下去，心安理得。但在破除迷信、解放思想的基础上，一切研究工作都遇到了这样的问题：目的性何在？当然，目的性包括实际的和理论上的意义，而且理论也是为实际服务的。在科学研究必须为社会主义建设服务的明确的目的性之下，我们的研究方向应当冲破多年来历史上形成的学科分类的框框，提倡以任务带动学科，组织各不同分支的学者从事由生产实际或各种科学技术提出的重大的综合性的数学问题的研究。以这种任务性的问题为经，以学科体系为纬，以经带纬，在数学中形成经纬交织的体系。
    由于数学发展方向的考虑也迫使我们要大胆地改革各级数学教育。我们没有必要，也不应该在数学教育中保留着数学这门科学在它的历史上走过的全部路程的遗迹，也就是说，不必要也不应该让学数学的青年在头脑中重演几千年来我们祖先在数学上的全部思惟和创造过程。对于在历史上已经自然地发展成更高阶段而成为另一学科的部分，就应当把它的原始形式从数学教学里基本排除，只保留它的基本概念部分，把时间让位给它在历史上形成的新学科。这样，算术的某些部分（包括四则应用题等），就可以用代数代替，平面几何中除着重培养学生的空间概念的部分以外，也可大大删简（其中不少部分可以用“形式逻辑”课代替），让位给三角学、解析几何学乃至集合论的初等部分等。解析几何和微分积分学的初等部分应当成为二十世纪下半期一切受过中等教育的人的常识，以便他们更好地理解客观世界中各种过程的量的侧面。数学中一些同新技术或各种实际应用密切关连的新分支——如“游戏论”、
  “信息论大意”等——也可以适当放在中等数学教育中。中等数学教育现代化了以后，高等数学教育也可以相应地改变。必须打破目前不少数学专业的高年级生还不能阅读最新数学文献（因他们缺少“现代语言”，只会十九世纪以前的东西）的情况。总之，我们应该根据数学最新发展情况，结合自然科学与技术发展的需要，不断改革数学教育，以便用最快的方式把最新最有用的数学知识教给青年一代。
    在数学教学中，乃至在编数学书和写论文时，都应该打破那种近数十年来流行的纯演译形式——这种呆板的形式遮掩了数学家发现数学真理的实际思惟过程，甚至是把这过程倒转过来告诉别人。如何从自然现象、工程技术问题中提炼出数学问题，由这些问题的探讨归纳出数学的概念、定理，对这些定理给予严谨的证明，把推演出的结果的实际涵义加以解释，并如何算出数值结果来用到解决实际问题上去，我们必须把这全部过程教给学生、告诉读者。
    让我们发挥敢想敢说敢作的共产主义风格，把厚今薄古的精神贯彻到数学研究、教学工作的各个角落中去！
