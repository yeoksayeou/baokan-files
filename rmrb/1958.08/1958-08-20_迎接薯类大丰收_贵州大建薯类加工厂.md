Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 19th: Guizhou Province is actively establishing root crop processing plants and rushing to manufacture processing machinery. This year, a bumper harvest of root crops is a certainty in Guizhou, with more high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and potatoes planted than in any previous year, with an estimated yield of over 26 billion jin. In order to secure this bumper harvest of root crops, townships and communes are vigorously building processing plants, preparing to promptly cut the root crops into slices and make them into starch, sugar, wine, and more. In accordance with the instructions of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, plans are in place to manufacture 280,000 sets of root crop processing machinery by the beginning of September. Zunyi and Tongren Prefectures have made preparations ahead of schedule.

    With the assistance of commercial departments, agricultural cooperatives in Tongren Prefecture have established more than 3,000 root crop processing plants and have already produced many locally made slicing machines, shredding machines, and grinding tools.

    Zunyi Prefecture expects root crop production to increase more than nineteen-fold compared to last year, with sweet potato production alone reaching over 12 billion jin. At a recent root crop work conference in this prefecture, the erroneous thinking of grain and commercial departments of fearing procurement, fearing storage, and fearing processing was criticized. It was decided that each county should immediately establish a root crop office to make comprehensive plans for the production, procurement, sales, processing, and storage of root crops, and to deploy these plans all the way down to the agricultural cooperatives.

　　迎接薯类大丰收
　　贵州大建薯类加工厂
    据新华社贵阳19日电  贵州省各地积极建立薯类加工厂和赶制加工机具。今年贵州全省薯类丰收已成定局，种植的红薯、马铃薯等高产作物比以往任何一年都多，预计可收二百六十亿斤以上。为了把大丰收的薯类作物稳稳拿到手，各地乡、社都在大搞加工厂，准备及时把薯类切成薯片，制成淀粉、糖和酒等。各地遵照中共贵州省委的指示，计划到9月初要制造出二十八万部薯类加工机具。遵义、铜仁两专区已提前作好了准备工作。
    铜仁专区各地农业社在商业部门的帮助下，已建立薯类加工厂三千多个，并已生产出许多土切片机、切丝机和磨粉器具。
    遵义专区预计薯类作物比去年增产十九倍多，仅红薯产量就可达一百二十亿斤以上。这个专区最近召开的薯类工作会议上，批判了粮食、商业部门存在的怕收购、怕保管和怕加工的错误思想，决定各县立即成立薯类办公室，对薯类产、购、销、加工和保管工作作出全面规划，一直布置到农业社。
