Xinhua News Agency, August 18th, Vienna dispatch, August 17th: The World Peace Council issued a communique in Vienna on the death of Joliot-Curie. The communique is as follows: "The World Peace Council has suffered a grievous loss. The President of the World Peace Council, the world-renowned scientist, a man of the greatest talent and courage, vast experience, and a great thinker with clear goals, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, has passed away.

　　"For ten years, Joliot-Curie actively and firmly participated in the work of formulating and upholding the principles of the World Peace Council, actively carrying out and leading the activities of this organization, and uniting all forces for the defense of peace. His scientific prestige and his excellent qualities were a reliable pillar of the world movement to ban atomic and nuclear weapons. His indomitable spirit, humanitarianism, and self-sacrifice made him a standard-bearer of the world peace movement, which has severely struck at the forces of war and destruction.

　　"His final address at the Stockholm Conference, like his various speeches before the representatives of the world peace movement, clearly pointed out the path that peace fighters should take in opposing war.

　　"Professor Joliot-Curie dedicated his life to the cause of peace and human progress. His spirit and his ideals will forever live in the hearts of millions. To commemorate our President and to continue the cause he fought for, all peace fighters should consider it their duty to intensify the fight against war and aggression at this moment of serious struggle.

　　"Our President was convinced before his death, and we are also convinced, that the ever-growing forces of peace will thoroughly defeat the forces of war."

      “约里奥—居里十年如一日积极地和坚定地参加了制定和维护世界和平理事会的原则的工作，积极地开展和领导了这个组织的活动，团结了维护和平的各种力量。他的科学上的声望和他的优良品质是世界禁止原子武器和核武器运动的可靠的支柱。他的坚忍不拔的精神、人道主义和自我牺牲的精神使他成为世界和平运动的旗手，这个运动严重地打击了战争和毁灭势力。
