　　Opening Up a Bright Future for a World Without the Threat of War
　　——Congratulating the Successful Conclusion of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament
　　The Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament successfully concluded in Tokyo, Japan, on August 20th. In its declaration, resolutions, and appeal to the people of the world, the conference issued a powerful call for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and opposition to nuclear war. At the same time, it demanded the immediate withdrawal of American and British aggressor troops from the Middle East, the dismantling of military bases on foreign territories, the abolition of colonialism, support for the people of all countries fighting for independence and unification, and the convening of a summit conference to seek ways to ease international tensions. The conference expressed the strong will and common desire of the people of all countries to oppose colonial aggression, support national independence, and safeguard world peace. This is another successful conference in the international peace movement after the "Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation" held in Stockholm in July this year. We, the Chinese people, warmly congratulate the achievements of the conference, fully support the declaration and various resolutions of the conference, and are willing to join hands closely with the people of the world to actively fight for "steering world politics towards peace and unfolding a bright future without the fear of radioactive dust and without the threat of war" with effective practical actions.
　　Since the closing of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament in August last year, peace forces and war forces have engaged in fierce struggle over the past year. Due to the growth and strengthening of peace forces, the movement of the people of all countries against atomic and hydrogen bombs has been rising. However, the aggressive forces headed by the United States not only do not stop nuclear testing and arms reduction, but continue to step up arms expansion and war preparations, creating tense situations and pushing mankind to the dangerous edge of war disaster.
　　Anyone can see that the American aggressive clique is the center of all reactionary forces in the world today and the most ferocious enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. It is the United States that continues to test nuclear weapons under the cover of the most unclean lie of so-called "clean hydrogen bombs," and it is also the United States that is the culprit threatening national independence and international security. Therefore, the struggle to defend world peace, oppose atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and strive for disarmament is inseparable from the struggle against the imperialist and colonial forces headed by the United States today. The major achievement of this conference is to combine the two and point out a clear struggle goal for the world peace movement.
　　Peace cannot be begged from imperialist aggressor forces, but can only be won through struggle. The conference called on the people of all countries to resolutely take strong joint actions to eliminate the threat of war. The powerful socialist camp has always stood at the forefront of defending peace. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are waging resolute struggles for national liberation and defense have also made significant contributions to the cause of world peace. In countries ruled by war forces, the mass struggle for peace is also growing. The convergence of these struggles is a reliable guarantee for preventing imperialist aggression and maintaining world peace. The conference declaration pointed out that at present, the real and serious danger of the outbreak of war still exists. Therefore, all peace-loving people must heighten their vigilance and be prepared. If the imperialist aggressive forces dare to impose war on the people of the world, then let them perish wherever they provoke war.
　　The Chinese people will never neglect the sacred responsibility they bear in the struggle to defend peace. We have deep concern for the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held in Japan. Our people have sent representatives to participate in the first, second, and third conferences. However, we regret that we were unable to send representatives to this year's fourth conference due to the undisguised hostility of the Kishi Nobusuke government towards the Chinese people. However, we are pleased to hear the friendly voices of the Japanese people calling for efforts to create a Japan where Chinese representatives can go. We also particularly noted the conference's call to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and for the United Nations Organization to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. The U.S. State Department recently issued a hysterical rant, repeating the old tune of non-recognition of China, and Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke followed suit as an echo of U.S. hostility towards China, but the Japanese people and the world's peace-loving people have other views, which is a wonderful contrast. This cannot but remind us of the words of a sober-minded Western personage: they wanted to "build a wall to surround China," but as a result, they themselves were "isolated outside the wall."
　　We cherish the friendship of the Japanese people and all peace-loving people in the world. Although we did not send representatives to the conference, our hearts are connected with them. We fully sympathize with the Japanese people, who, after suffering three disasters in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Fukuryu Maru, have suffered fourth and fifth disasters due to U.S. nuclear weapons tests, with the Japanese ships "Takuyo Maru" and "Satsuma Maru," "Kazeyukawa Maru" and "Eihom Maru" being affected. We fully understand the feelings of the Japanese people who strongly oppose U.S. imperialism openly transporting nuclear weapons into Japan and continuing to test hydrogen bombs in the Pacific. We sympathetically watch the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Japanese people against the Kishi Nobusuke government's following the United States, stepping up the revival of militarism, and being hostile to the Chinese people. The Japanese people can fully count on the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world in their struggle to safeguard peace, democracy, and independence. Now is an era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, an era when the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war. As long as all peace-loving countries and people unite and fight for the prevention of nuclear war, for the opposition to colonialism, and for world peace, a bright future without the threat of war will surely appear!

### 为没有战争威胁的世界打开光明前景——祝第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会的胜利闭幕

　　为没有战争威胁的世界打开光明前景
　　——祝第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会的胜利闭幕
    第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会已经在8月20日在日本东京胜利闭幕。大会在它的宣言、决议和给世界人民的呼吁书中，发出了强有力的要求禁止核武器和反对核战争的呼声，同时要求美英侵略军队立即撤出中东，要求撤销外国领土上的军事基地，要求废除殖民主义，支持为独立和统一而斗争的各国人民，并要求召开一次最高级会议来寻求缓和国际局势的途径。大会表达了当前各国人民反对殖民侵略、支持民族独立、维护世界和平的坚强意志和共同愿望。这是今年7月斯德哥尔摩“裁军和国际合作大会”之后，国际和平运动中又一次成功的大会。我们中国人民热烈祝贺大会的成就，完全支持大会的宣言和各项决议，并且愿意同全世界人民紧密地携起手来，用有效的实际行动，为“把世界政治导向和平，为没有放射性微尘的恐惧和没有战争威胁的将来展开光明的前景”而积极斗争。
    从去年8月第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会闭幕之后，一年来，和平力量同战争力量进行了激烈搏斗。由于和平力量的发展壮大，各国人民反对原子弹氢弹运动日益高涨。但是以美国为首的侵略势力不但不停止核试验和裁减军备，反而继续加紧扩军备战，制造紧张局势，把人类推向战争灾难的危险边缘。
    谁都可以看得出，美国侵略集团是今天世界上一切反动势力的中心，是世界上所有爱好和平的人民的最凶恶的敌人。在所谓“干净的氢弹”这种最不干净的谎言掩饰下继续试验核武器的是美国，威胁民族独立和国际安全的罪魁也是美国。因此，保卫世界和平、反对原子弹、氢弹和争取裁军的斗争，在今天，同反对以美国为首的帝国主义势力和殖民势力的斗争，是分割不开的。这次大会的重大成就，就是把两者结合起来，为世界和平运动指出了明确的斗争目标。
    和平不能向帝国主义侵略势力乞求，而只能从斗争中争取。大会号召各国人民坚决采取有力的联合行动消灭战争威胁。强大的社会主义阵营一向就站在保卫和平的最前线。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国为争取和保卫民族独立而进行坚决斗争的人民，也为世界和平事业作出了重大的贡献。在战争势力治统着的国家，维护和平的群众性斗争也在日益增长。这些斗争汇合起来，就是制止帝国主义侵略行动、维护世界和平的可靠保证。大会宣言中指出，目前，爆发战争的现实的、严重的危险依然存在。因此，一切爱好和平的人民，必须提高警惕，作好准备。如果帝国主义侵略势力竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，它们在哪里挑起战争，就让它们在哪里灭亡。
    中国人民决没有忽略自己在保卫和平的斗争中所肩负的神圣责任。我们对于在日本召开的禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会抱有深切关怀。我国人民曾经派代表参加了第一、二、三届大会。而今年的第四届大会，由于岸信介政府对于中国人民的露骨的敌视态度，我们不能派代表前去，这是我们引为遗憾的。但是，我们高兴地听到日本人民要求努力造成一个中国代表能够前去的日本的友好的呼声。我们还特别注意到：大会为促进中日邦交正常化，要求联合国组织恢复中华人民共和国应有的权利而作的呼吁。美国国务院最近刚刚发了一通歇斯底里叫嚣，重弹不承认中国的老调，日本首相岸信介也跟在后面充当美国敌视中国的应声虫，可是日本人民和世界爱好和平人民却另有看法，这真是一个绝妙的对照。这不能不使我们想起一位头脑清醒的西方人士说过的话：他们想“筑一道墙来包围中国”，结果他们自己被“隔在墙外”了。
    我们珍视日本人民和世界一切爱好和平人民的友谊。我们虽然没有派代表参加大会，但是我们的心跟他们连在一起。我们完全同情日本人民在遭受广岛、长崎、福龙丸三次灾难之后，由于美国的核武器试验，日本轮船“拓洋号”和“萨摩号”、“风宇川丸”和“荣凤丸”又遭受第四次、第五次灾难。我们完全理解日本人民强烈反对美帝国主义把核武器公开运进日本和继续在太平洋试验氢弹的感情。我们同情地注视着日本人民为反对岸信介政府追随美国、加紧复活军国主义、敌视中国人民而进行的英勇顽强的斗争。日本人民在维护和平、民主和独立的斗争中，完全可以指望得到中国人民的和世界一切爱好和平人民的同情和支持。现在是东风日盛、西风日衰的时代，和平力量大过战争力量的时代。只要一切爱好和平的国家和人民，为制止核战争、为反对殖民主义、为世界和平而团结一致地进行斗争，一个没有战争威胁的光明前景就一定会出现！
