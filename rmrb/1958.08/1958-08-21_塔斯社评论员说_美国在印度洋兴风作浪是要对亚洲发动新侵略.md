Xinhua News Agency, August 20th. TASS commentator Kharkov wrote on August 19th: The U.S. Marines are stirring again, this time landing in Singapore, which has always been British territory.

It is obvious that the U.S. Marines' stationing in Singapore is not temporary. It can be predicted that they will occupy this fortress in the Far East, which is related to British colonial interests, for a long time. In this regard, it is worth noting that there are reports that the United States wants to establish a new navy, and the Indian Ocean will become its area of activity.

The commentator said, what is the purpose of the U.S. Indian Ocean Fleet that is being planned? Who will its guns and rocket launchers be aimed at? As everyone knows, there are countries in the Indian Ocean region that have gotten rid of colonial rule and actively pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence. These are India, Burma, Ceylon, and other countries. It is very clear that the United States now wants to turn the tranquil Indian Ocean into a place for planning provocations and aggressions. The U.S. Marines' landing in Singapore this time also threatens peace and security in Southeast Asia.

The commentator concluded that the United States' actions have been fully agreed to by the United Kingdom. A British naval spokesperson had no choice but to say that British bases are open to U.S. warships and Marines. However, the problem is not just limited to bases. The remnants of the former British Empire have now become a link in the chain of aggression that war maniacs want to establish around the world.

### 塔斯社评论员说  美国在印度洋兴风作浪是要对亚洲发动新侵略

　　塔斯社评论员说
    美国在印度洋兴风作浪是要对亚洲发动新侵略
    新华社20日讯  塔斯社评论员哈尔科夫19日写道：美国海军陆战队又在蠢动了，这次在一直是英国领地的新加坡登陆了。
    显而易见，美国海军陆战队屯驻新加坡不是临时性的。可以预料，它要在远东的这个同英国殖民利益有关的要塞长久地盘据下来。在这方面，值得注意的是，有消息说，美国想建立一支新的海军，印度洋将成为它的活动区。
    评论员说，正在策划中的美国印度洋舰队的目的是什么呢？它的炮口和火箭装置将指向谁呢？大家知道，在印度洋地区有一些已经摆脱了殖民统治和积极奉行和平共处政策的国家。这就是印度、缅甸、锡兰和其他国家。十分明显，现在美国想要把风平浪静的印度洋变成策划挑衅和侵略行动的地方。美国海军陆战队这次在新加坡登陆也威胁着东南亚地区的和平和安全。
    评论员最后说，美国的行动完全得到了英国的同意。英国海军发言人只好说，英国基地对美国军舰和海军陆战队是敞开大门的。但是，问题不仅仅限于基地。前大英帝国的残余现在成了战争狂人想要在全世界建立的侵略链条的一个环节。
