A Sweet Memory

Chen Sitao, student of Beijing No. 4 High School

In the early days of the liberation of Baoding, the lively places, besides Ma Hao, Chenghuang Temple, South Street, and Zihe Tao, also included the entrance of the Masses Cinema. This place was often surrounded by many people waiting to watch movies, and at night, it lit up with the rare neon lights of Baoding.

Our orphanage was located in Dachunshu Hutong, near the cinema. We, a group of orphans, would go to watch movies, and because we were small and nimble, we would squeeze through the railings.

One evening, we went to watch a movie again, hearing that it was a film about the army fighting. A long line of Eighth Route Army soldiers (at that time, I called the People's Liberation Army the Eighth Route Army) was lined up at the cinema entrance, neat and spirited. Shi Qixin and I watched them for a while, then ran into the cinema. The ticket collector recognized us as their "old neighbors" from our tattered clothes and dirty faces, and didn't even bother with us. We went inside and saw that there were no good seats downstairs, so we hurried upstairs. The good seats upstairs were all empty, and Shi Qixin and I picked two of the best seats and sat down. The guy selling sugared pears and melon seeds glared at us, and I glared back, thinking, I'm not buying anything from you anyway.

The soldiers standing outside came in and sat down in order. We were surrounded by Eighth Route Army soldiers in gray or yellow uniforms, with two buttons on their hats. At this time, a young Eighth Route Army soldier of seventeen or eighteen came to chase us away, and I clenched my fists, ready to fight. Fighting was "commonplace" for us. At this moment, the old Eighth Route Army soldier standing next to him told the young soldier to leave. I saw him looking at me with a smile, so I lowered my fist and bowed my head, feeling a little uneasy: What was he smiling about? Even though it was a cold day, I was still wearing clothes that exposed my skin, dragging two mismatched worn-out shoes with bare feet. I was in a daze when the old Eighth Route Army soldier patted me on the shoulder and said, "Little devil, how about this, I'll sit on the stool and you sit on my lap!" Although he didn't speak with a Baoding accent and I didn't understand what "little devil" meant, his kind and amiable attitude was something I had never seen before.

I agreed and sat on his lap. He used his cotton coat to protect my body. The sudden warmth made me shiver, and I felt itchy all over and started scratching. He asked me if I had lice on me? I said I had a lot, and he helped me scratch. His big hand caressed my skin, and I felt so comfortable, so warm from the inside out. This kind of warmth was only present when I was with my father, but my father had been dead for four years.

He asked me what my name was, and I said, "My name is Ermao, also called Qizhu Guan. My father died when I was seven (by Chinese reckoning), and my mother went to work as a nanny, sending me to the orphanage. The people there call me Qizhu Guan." I pointed to Shi Qixin next to me and said, "He came to the orphanage when he was nine, so he's called Jiuzhu Guan." This old Eighth Route Army soldier aroused my great affection. Since I entered the orphanage, I had never talked so much to anyone other than arguing and fighting.

I asked him what his name was, and he told me it was "Nie Rongzhen." The old soldier in the cotton coat's surname had three "ear" characters, which I found very interesting, so I remembered it as soon as he wrote it on my palm. I had already learned the character "Rong," but I had never seen the character "Zhen" before. I knew how to write it, but I always mispronounced it. Afterwards, when I told my friends about this, I would often say, "An old Eighth Route Army soldier held me, his name is Nie Rongqin."

From my conversation and the clothes I wore, he knew that we were living a hard life, so he said to me, "In the future, we will establish nurseries to specifically take care of you helpless children. There will be nannies to take care of you, just like being with your mother, you will eat your fill and be warmly clothed, and you won't suffer anymore." I asked him if I could go, and he said I could, and I was so happy that I couldn't close my mouth, and I talked even more. I sang him the most popular song in the orphanage: "Heartless father, heartless mother, sent me to the orphanage. Moldy rice, rotten vegetable soup, don't eat, don't eat, still put it on." Then I sang our orphanage song: "We are the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we are all lonely and helpless people, we walk in a line, struggling to survive..."

After he listened, he started to reason with me, saying, "China is a very big place, but because it is ruled by big bad guys like Chiang Kai-shek, the people are bullied and can't live. If it were today, your father wouldn't have been worked to death. We want to establish a people's government, so that everyone can live a good life." He told me many principles, some of which I didn't understand, but I believed that what he said was right, because he was a good person! I felt sweet in my heart. This was the first time in my life that I had listened to someone so patiently reasoning with me.

The lights in the cinema went out, and the movie started. I yawned twice, feeling comfortable and warm all over, and fell asleep without realizing it. I was so happy! I dreamed of my father who had died four years ago, he bought me candy and taught me how to play chess, he told me that the horse moves in the shape of "sun," and the elephant moves in the shape of "field." We played three games, and I lost all of them. My father let me have the "chariot, horse, and cannon," but I still lost. I was so anxious that I couldn't help but wake up abruptly. I opened my eyes and saw that the movie had ended, and Nie Rongzhen was still holding me. I quickly climbed down from his lap, and suddenly a gust of cold wind blew, and I shivered, rubbing my eyes embarrassedly. Someone from the cinema next to me quietly said to me, "Do you know who he is? He's a big official!" I shook my head and said, "No, he's not a big official, he's Nie Rongzhen, he's an old Eighth Route Army soldier!" In my impression, big officials are very fierce, often hitting and scolding us, how could they hold me!

When he left the cinema, he waved to me and said, "Ermao, goodbye!" I also waved to him and said, "Nie Rongzhen, goodbye!"

Later, I often talked about him with my friends, and I wanted to find him to play, but I didn't know where he lived. I often miss him. I gradually grew up and realized that he was one of the leaders of our country, he was a marshal of our People's Liberation Army.

Nine years have passed in a flash. Under the cultivation and guidance of the Party, I have become a high school student. Just as Marshal Nie Rongzhen said, our lives have undergone a thorough and fundamental change. Whenever I recall this experience from my childhood, I feel very happy. (Attached picture)

    一段甜蜜的回忆
    北京四中学生　陈嗣涛
    保定在刚解放的时候，热闹的地方除了马号、城隍庙、南大街、紫河套以外，还有就是群众电影院门口了。这里经常围着很多等着看电影的人，一到晚上还亮起了保定少有的霓红灯。
    我们孤儿院就在电影院附近的大椿树胡同里。我们这群孤儿去看电影，因为个子小，又灵巧，就从栏杆缝钻进去。
    一天傍晚，我们又去看电影，听说演的是部队打仗的影片。电影院门口排着长长的八路军队伍（那时我都把解放军叫八路军），既整齐又精神。我和石启新围着他们看了一会儿，就跑进电影院去了。收票的从我们破旧的衣服上，从我们肮脏的面孔上认出是他们的“老街坊”，理都没理我们。我们进去一看，楼下没有好位子了，就赶忙往楼上跑。楼上的好位子都空着呢，我和石启新挑了两个最好的位子坐下了。卖糖梨瓜子那个家伙直瞪我们，我也瞪他，心里想，反正我不买你的东西吃。
    站在外面的军人都进来顺序地坐下了。我们前后左右都坐满了穿灰色或黄色衣服的八路军，帽子上都缀着两个扣子。这时候来了个十七八岁的小八路撵我们走，我就攒紧拳头准备打架。打架对我们来说是“家常便饭”。这时候，站在旁边的那老八路让那个小八路走开了。我瞧他瞅着我乐，就把拳头放下来，低下头去，心里有点发毛：他乐什么呢？虽然是大冷天，我仍 然穿着露肉衣服，赤脚拖着两只不一般大的破鞋。我正发怔，那个老八路拍着我的肩膀说：“小鬼，这样好不好，我坐凳子你坐在我身上吧！”虽然他说话不是保定口音，我也不懂什么叫“小鬼”，但是他那种亲切、和蔼的态度是我没见过的。
    我同意了，坐在他的身上。他用棉大衣护着我的身体。由于乍一温暖，使我打了一个颤，觉得浑身发痒，就搔起来。他问我身上有虱子吗？我说多得很，他也帮我搔起来。他的大手抚摸着我的肉，我觉得那么舒服，我觉得从心里到外面都温暖，这种温暖只是和父亲在一起时才有的，可是我的父亲已经死了四年了。
    他问我叫什么名字，我说：“我叫二毛，又叫七珠官。我虚岁七岁那年爸爸死了，妈妈给别人去看孩子，把我送到娃娃堂，那里的人就叫我七珠官。”我又指着坐在旁边的石启新说：“他是九岁进娃娃堂的，他就叫九珠官。”这个老八路引起了我很大的好感，自从我进了孤儿院以后，除了吵嘴打架以外，从来也没和别人说过这样多的话。
    我问他叫什么名字，他告诉我叫“聂荣臻”。这个穿着棉大衣的老兵的姓是三个“耳”字，我觉得很有趣，所以在他写在我手心上的时候，一下就记住了。“荣”字我早就学过，可是“臻”字从来没见过，知道怎么写了，可是总是常念错了。过后我把这件事告诉我的伙伴时，我常说：“一个老八路抱过我，他叫聂荣秦。”
    从我的谈话里和我穿的衣服上，他知道我们生活很苦，他就跟我说：“将来要成立托儿所，专门收养你们这些无依无靠的孩子。那里有阿姨照顾你们，像在妈妈身边一样，吃得饱穿得暖，再也不受罪了。”我问他我是不是可以去，他说可以，我乐得合不上嘴，话就更多了。我给他唱在孤儿院顶流行的歌：“狠心的爹，狠心的娘，把我送到娃娃堂。霉米饭，坏菜汤，不吃不吃又盛上。”接着又唱了我们的院歌：“我们是黄帝的子孙，我们都是孤苦伶仃的人，我们走在一个行列里，挣扎着生存……”
    他听完了就给我讲起道理来，他说：“我们中国的地方很大，可是因为蒋介石一些大坏蛋统治，欺侮老百姓活不下去。要是在今天，你爸爸不会活活累死的。我们要建立人民的政权，叫大家都过好日子。”他讲了许多道理，有些我听不懂，可是我相信他说的都是对的，因为他是个好人呵！我心里甜甜的，我长这么大，还是第一次听别人这样耐心地跟我讲道理。
    电影院的灯熄了，电影开演了。我打了两个哈欠，觉得浑身又舒服又暖和，不知不觉就睡着了。我真高兴呵！我梦见了死去四年的爸爸，他给我买回来糖，还教我下象棋，他告诉我马走“日”字，象走“田”字。我们下了三盘，我都输了。爸爸让我“车马炮”，我还是输了。我真急得没法，一下急醒了。睁眼一看，电影已经散了，聂荣臻还抱着我呢。我赶紧从他身上爬下来，忽然一阵冷风吹来，我打了个寒颤，不好意思地揉着眼睛。旁边一个电影院里的人悄悄对我说：“你知道他是谁吗？他可是个大官呀！”我摇摇头说：“不，他不是大官，他是聂荣臻，他是老八路！”在我的印象里，大官都是很厉害的，常打我们骂我们，哪会抱我呢！
    出了电影院，他向我招招手说：“二毛，再见！”我也招手向他说：“聂荣臻，再见！”
    后来，我跟小伙伴常常讲到他，我还想找他去玩，可不知道他在哪儿住。我常常想念他。我渐渐长大了，才知道他是我们国家的领导人之一，他是我们人民解放军的元帅。
    一晃九年了。在党的培养和教导下，我已经成了高中学生。正像聂荣臻元帅说的那样，我们的生活有了彻底的、根本的变化。每当我回忆起小时候这段经历，我感到非常的幸福。（附图片）
