Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: According to a TASS report from Budapest: "People's Freedom" and "People's Voice" published Iraqi Republic Foreign Minister Jamil's conversation with reporters from these two newspapers on the 9th.

Jamil said that the young Iraqi Republic hopes to maintain good relations with all countries that respect its sovereignty and independence. First and foremost, the Iraqi government hopes to strengthen relations with those countries that were the first to recognize the victory of the Iraqi revolution in times of difficulty.

Jamil emphasized that strengthening relations with the Soviet Union is particularly important. Four years ago, the anti-people Said government severed relations with the Soviet Union without any justification.

When discussing the victory of the Iraqi revolution, the minister said that the victory of the revolution buried colonialism and opened a new era for Iraq. He also said, "Today we bury colonialism, and tomorrow we will eliminate feudalism."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 10th: Baghdad's "Al-Khabar" commented on the communiqué of the Khrushchev-Mao Zedong talks, believing that the attitude taken by the Soviet Union and China towards the Arab national independence movement is the most appreciated. They help Arab countries and provide active assistance unconditionally, supporting Arab countries in their struggle for independence, freedom, and national goals.

The commentary said that the whole world believes that the Soviet-Chinese talks are very important because the Soviet Union and China occupy a very strong position in international politics and can greatly influence the development of the international situation. At the same time, small and weak countries place their hopes on the policies pursued by these two great powers and can rely on their help and support to realize their hopes.

　　贾迈尔外长对匈牙利记者说
　　伊拉克已经埋葬了殖民主义
　　巴格达报纸感激中苏支持阿拉伯民族独立运动
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：“人民自由报”和“人民之声报”9日发表了伊拉克共和国外交部长贾迈尔对这两家报纸记者的谈话。
    贾迈尔说，年轻的伊拉克共和国希望同所有尊重它的主权和独立的国家保持良好关系。首先，伊拉克政府希望同那些在困难的时候最先承认伊拉克革命胜利的国家加强关系。
    贾迈尔强调指出，加强同苏联的关系特别重要，四年前，反人民的赛义德政府毫无理由地断绝了同苏联的关系。
    这位部长在谈到伊拉克革命胜利的问题时说，革命的胜利埋葬了殖民主义，在伊拉克面前开辟了一个新纪元。他并且说，今天我们埋葬了殖民主义，而明天我们还要消灭封建主义。
    据新华社巴格达10日电　巴格达“消息报”在评论赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东的会谈公报时认为，苏中两国对于阿拉伯民族独立运动所采取的态度是最令人感激的，它们帮助阿拉伯国家，并且无条件地提供积极的援助，支持阿拉伯国家争取独立、自由和民族目标的斗争。
    评论说，全世界都认为苏中会谈是非常重要的，因为苏联和中国在国际政治中占有一个非常强大的地位，并且能够大大地影响国际局势的发展。同时，弱小国家把它们的希望寄托在这两个强国所奉行的政策上，并且可以依靠它们的帮助和支持来实现它们的希望。
