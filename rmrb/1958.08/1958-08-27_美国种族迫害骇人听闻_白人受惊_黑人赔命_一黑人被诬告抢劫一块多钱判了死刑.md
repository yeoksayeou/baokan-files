Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, New York dispatch: American racial persecution is appalling.
    Whites are frightened, blacks pay with their lives.
    A black man was falsely accused of robbing over a dollar and sentenced to death.

    A recent ruling by an Alabama court in the United States revealed a despicable persecution of a Black man: Jimmie Wilson has been sentenced to death for allegedly attempting to rob one dollar and ninety-five cents.
    The fabricated case supposedly occurred on the evening of July 27, 1957. The "plaintiff," Mrs. Barker, described to the jurors, with great exaggeration, how Wilson, the Black man who managed her yard, planned to steal one dollar and ninety-five cents from her purse. The eighty-two-year-old white woman also falsely accused Wilson of attempted rape.
    The prosecutor demanded that Wilson be sentenced to death, saying that the Black man made Mrs. Barker "fear for her life." Although he only wanted to rob one dollar and ninety-five cents, robbery is robbery after all.
    Despite Wilson's eloquent testimony in court proving his innocence, the court still insisted that he find so-called "witnesses."
    Under such absurd accusations, the Black man Wilson was finally sentenced to death by the court and will be sent to the electric chair on September 5. This despicable persecution has aroused the anger of fair-minded people at home and abroad. According to reports, Alabama Governor Folsom has been flooded with letters of protest from all over the country. People are demanding that the state's highest court retry the case.

　　美国种族迫害骇人听闻
    白人受惊  黑人赔命
    一黑人被诬告抢劫一块多钱判了死刑
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：美国亚拉巴马州法院最近宣布了一件对黑人卑鄙迫害的判决：黑人杰米威尔逊已经被判处死刑；他的罪名是想抢劫美元一元九角五分。
    这个捏造出来的案件据说是发生在1957年7月27日的晚上。“原告”巴克尔夫人煞有介事地向审判员描述替她管理院子的黑人威尔逊怎样打算抢走她钱袋里的一元九角五分钱。这个八十二岁的白人老太婆还诬告说，威尔逊企图强奸她。
    检察官要求把威尔逊判处死刑，他说，这个黑人使得巴克尔夫人“为她的生命担惊受骇”，虽然他要抢劫的仅仅是一元九角五分，但是抢劫终归是抢劫。
    尽管威尔逊在法庭上雄辩地证明他自己是无罪的，但是法院仍然硬要他找出所谓“证人”来。
    就在这种荒谬的诬告下，黑人威尔逊终于被法院判处死刑，并且将在9月5日送上电椅。这一卑鄙的迫害案件已经引起美国国内外公正人士的愤怒。据报道，亚拉巴马州州长弗尔逊已经被来自全国各地的抗议信件所包围。人们要求这个州的最高法院重审这个案件。
