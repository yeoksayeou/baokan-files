Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th August: Hong Kong educators, as well as teachers, students, staff, and parents of Pui Kiu Middle School, strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable act of forcibly deporting Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School.

Huang Zufen, principal of Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 6th that this persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities infringed upon the rights of Chinese people to engage in education in Hong Kong. He expressed extreme indignation and strongly protested against the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable deportation of Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School.

Huang Jianli, principal of Hong Kong Han Wah Middle School, pointed out that this action by the Hong Kong British authorities was clearly a planned attempt to destroy and persecute patriotic education in Hong Kong. He said that the achievements of the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School in education are obvious to all, and this practice of the Hong Kong British authorities violates justice and public opinion.

Cheng Qingsheng, principal of Hong Kong Chung Yip College, said: If the Hong Kong British authorities think that they can deprive the Chinese people of their right to run patriotic education through such persecution methods, they are wrong. This behavior will only arouse the anger of Hong Kong compatriots.

On the morning of the 6th, after learning that Principal Du Boqui had been unreasonably deported by the Hong Kong British authorities, the teachers, students, and staff of Pui Kiu Middle School immediately held a conference to strongly protest this persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities. After the meeting, all the teachers jointly submitted an appeal to the public. All the students also issued a statement saying: Our school has been established for twelve years. From the first day of its establishment, it has held high the banner of patriotic education. Our principal is a teacher who has persisted in education for decades and has always been loved by all the students. All of us students are proud to be able to study in such a good school. However, the Hong Kong British Education Department used the excuse of the school's imperfect management to cancel the principal's supervision and the teachers' registration. In a situation where they were at a loss for words, they finally became angry and deported Principal Du. We express our strong protest against this. On the afternoon of the same day, the Pui Kiu Middle School Parents-Teachers Association also held an expanded council meeting, at which a statement was passed, expressing a solemn protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable persecution of the school.

On the 6th, Pui Kiu Middle School sent representatives to the Hong Kong British Police Department and the Education Department one after another, demanding an explanation for the reason for Principal Du Boqui's deportation, but the Hong Kong British Education Department refused to meet with the school's representatives.

    英国当局的做法违反正义和公理
    香港教育界对杜伯奎被迫害事件表示严重抗议
    据新华社香港7日电  香港教育界人士以及培侨中学的师生员工、学生家长，严正抗议香港英国当局强迫将培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境的无理行为。
    香港中华中学校长黄祖芬6日向新华社记者说，香港英国当局的这种迫害行为侵犯了中国人在香港从事教育事业的权利。他对香港英国当局无理地将培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境表示极端愤慨并且提出严重抗议。
    香港汉华中学校长黄建立指出，香港英国当局这一行动显然是在有计划地对香港爱国教育事业进行摧残和迫害。他说，培侨中学校长在教育事业上的成就是有目共睹的，香港英国当局这种做法是违反正义和公理的。
    香港中业专科学校校长成庆生说：如果香港英国当局以为用这样的迫害手段就可以剥夺中国人办理爱国教育的权利，那就错了，这种行为只有引起香港同胞的愤怒。
    香港培侨中学的师生员工6日早上在得知校长杜伯奎被香港英国当局无理递解出境的消息后，立即举行大会，对香港英国当局的这种迫害行为提出严重抗议。会后全体教师联名向社会人士提出了申诉。全体学生也发表声明说：我们学校创办了十二个年头，它从创办的第一天起，就举着爱国主义教育的鲜明旗帜。我们的校长是一位坚持了数十年教育工作的老师，一向得到全校同学的爱戴，我们全校同学都为能进入这样一间好学校读书而自豪。可是，香港英国教育司却以学校办理不完善为借口，要取销校长的监督及教师的注册。在理屈词穷的情况下，最后还恼羞成怒地把杜校长递解出境，我们对此表示严重的抗议。当天下午，培侨中学学生家长教师联谊会也举行扩大理事会议，会上通过一项声明，对香港英国当局无理地迫害学校表示严正抗议。
    培侨中学6日曾先后派代表到香港英国警务处和教育司署，要求解释校长杜伯奎被递解出境的理由，但是香港英国教育司竟拒绝接见学校的代表。
