　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th, TASS reported: On August 27th, the Soviet Union launched a single-stage geophysical rocket, reaching a calculated altitude of 450 kilometers.

　　The rocket was launched from the mid-latitudes of the European part of the Soviet Union.

　　The rocket flew in a predetermined direction at a small angle to the vertical, and then landed accurately at the predetermined location.

　　The rocket was equipped with geophysical instruments for comprehensive exploration of the upper atmosphere. In addition, two experimental animals (dogs) were placed in a specially sealed cabin.

　　The cabin was equipped with a reduction system, an automatic recording system for animal biological functions, and a film device for photographing the animals' activities during the flight.

　　The experimental animals were in good condition after landing from an altitude of 450 kilometers.

　　Previously, the highest altitude at which Soviet experimental animals had successfully landed was 212 kilometers.

　　The rocket was stable throughout the entire flight, including the inertial flight phase, and did not rotate around the vertical or horizontal axes.

　　The total weight of the geophysical scientific instruments, radio telemetry devices, energy devices, the sealed cabin with animals and auxiliary systems, and the instrument cabin structure on the rocket was 1,690 kilograms.

　　This rocket, launched according to the International Geophysical Year plan, was equipped with: an ultra-shortwave dispersion radio interferometer to measure the free electron concentration in the ionosphere; instruments to measure the ionic composition of the atmosphere; devices to study the concentration of positive ions in the atmosphere; instruments to measure electron temperature; ionization pressure gauges and magnetic pressure gauges to measure air pressure; instruments to record micrometeorite particle impacts; a spectrograph to record the solar spectrum in the ultraviolet region; and instruments to record infrared radiation from the Earth and the Earth's atmosphere.

　　All devices worked normally during the flight and ensured that the necessary scientific data were obtained, which is now being processed.

　　苏联火箭划破九重天
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社莫斯科29日电：8月27日苏联发射了一个一级地球物理火箭，它达到了计算高度四百五十公里的高空。
    火箭是在苏联欧洲部分中纬度地区发射的。
    火箭向与垂直线成不大的角度的预定方向飞行，然后准确地在预定地点着陆。
    在火箭上装置有对大气高层进行综合考察的地球物理仪器。此外，在特制的密封舱里装有两个试验动物（狗）。
    舱内设有还原系统、动物生物机能自动记录系统和拍摄动物在飞行过程中的活动的电影装置。
    试验动物从四百五十公里高空着陆以后状况良好。
    在此以前，苏联试验动物着陆成功的最高高度为二百一十二公里。
    火箭在整个飞行过程中，包括惯性飞行过程，是稳定的，火箭没有围绕垂直轴和水平轴旋转。
    火箭上的地球物理科学仪器、无线电遥测装置、能源装置、带有动物和辅助系统的密封舱以及仪器舱结构的总重量为一千六百九十公斤。
    根据国际地球物理年计划发射的这个火箭装置有：测量电离层自由电子浓度的超短波色散无线电干涉仪；测量大气层离子成份的仪器；研究大气层正离子浓度的装置；测量电子温度的仪器；测量气压的电离压力表和磁性压力表；记录微流星粒子撞击的仪器；记录光谱紫外线部分的日光摄谱仪；记录地球和地球大气层红外线辐射的仪器。
    一切装置在飞行时都正常地进行了工作，并且保证获得了必要的科学资料，这些科学资料现在正在处理中。
