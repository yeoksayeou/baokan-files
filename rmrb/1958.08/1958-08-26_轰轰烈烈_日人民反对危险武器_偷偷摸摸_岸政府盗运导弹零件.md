Xinhua News Agency, August 24th. TASS Tokyo, August 23rd: According to Japanese radio reports, Fuji Yoshida City held a mass rally on the 23rd to protest the transportation of "Oerlikon" missiles purchased in Switzerland into Japan, and advocated for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Approximately seven hundred people participated in the rally, including farmers from Yamanashi Prefecture, delegations from local organizations of the Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, and representatives of peace activists from the neighboring prefectures of Shizuoka and Kanagawa.

Those who spoke at the meeting demanded that the "Oerlikon" missiles be returned to Switzerland and opposed arming the Japanese army with atomic weapons.

In a resolution passed, participants in the mass rally protested the import and testing of missiles, and demanded the return of land near Mount Fuji that had been turned into a training ground by the Americans. After the mass rally, a demonstration march was held.

Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Tokyo News: Under the resolute opposition of the Japanese people, the Japanese "Defense Agency" secretly transported a portion of "Oerlikon 56" missile parts from the back gate of the Yokosuka Naval Base at 2:40 AM this morning using military trucks of the "Self-Defense Forces." This portion of the parts has been transported to the First Technology Research Institute of the "Defense Agency" in Meguro, Tokyo.

To prevent such secretive actions by the "Defense Agency," the Japanese people who oppose nuclear armament have already increased the picket line composed of Japanese workers and students to one thousand people today, tightly guarding all exits of this naval base. Currently, the main parts of the missiles are still besieged by the Japanese people in this base.

This batch of missiles arrived in Yokohama from Switzerland on August 17th. Because dockworkers resolutely opposed unloading them, the Japanese government used military force on the 24th to transport these weapons to the Yokosuka Naval Base. (Attached photo)

The "Arima Maru" freighter, carrying a set of "Oerlikon 56" missile launchers and ten missiles purchased abroad by the Japanese Defense Agency, arrived at Yokohama Port on August 17th. Dockworkers used their practical action of refusing to unload the missiles ashore to warn the Kishi Nobusuke government's nuclear armament policy. The picture shows demonstrating dockworkers.

　　轰轰烈烈　日人民反对危险武器  偷偷摸摸　岸政府盗运导弹零件
    新华社24日讯　塔斯社东京23日讯：据日本电台报道，富士吉田市在23日举行了群众大会，抗议把在瑞士购买的“厄利康”型导弹运入日本，并且主张禁止原子武器和氢武器。参加群众大会的约有七百人，其中有来自山梨县的农民、社会党和自由民主党地方组织的代表团以及来自静冈和神奈川两个邻县的和平战士的代表。
    在会上发言的人要求把“厄利康”型导弹退回瑞士，反对用原子武器武装日本军队。
    群众大会的参加者在通过的决议中抗议输入和试验导弹，要求收回在富士山附近被美国人变成了演习场的土地。群众大会结束之后举行了示威游行。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本“防卫厅”在日本人民坚决反对下，今天早上二时四十分用“自卫队”的军用卡车从横须贺海军基地的后门偷运走了一部分“厄利康56”型导弹的零件。这部分零件已被运到东京目黑的“防卫厅”第一技术研究所。
    反对核武装的日本人民为了防止“防卫厅”的这种偷偷摸摸的行为，今天已经把由日本工人和学生组成的纠察队增加到一千人，严密地守住这个海军基地所有的出口。目前，导弹的主要部分仍然被日本人民围困在这个基地里。
    这批导弹8月17日就从瑞士运到横滨，由于那里的码头工人坚决反对卸运，日本政府在24日使用军事力量把这批武器运到了横须贺的海军基地。（附图片）
    载运日本防卫厅从国外买来的“厄利康56”型导弹发射装置一套和导弹十枚的“有马丸”货轮8月17日到达横滨港。码头工人用拒绝向岸上卸运这批导弹的实际行动，警告岸信介政府的核武装政策。图为示威的码头工人。　　　　（新华社稿）
