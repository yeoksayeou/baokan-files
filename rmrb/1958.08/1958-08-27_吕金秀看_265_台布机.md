　　Lü Jinxiu Oversees 265 Looms
　　Lü Jinxiu, a young female worker at the Jinhua Textile Factory in Shanxi, who originally oversaw sixteen manual looms, increased her workload to managing two hundred and sixty-five automatic looms.
　　Although Lü Jinxiu is a veteran worker with twelve years of experience, she has only been managing looms for the past three or four years. In particular, she has only been overseeing automatic looms for just over a year. Why is it that someone as inexperienced as Lü Jinxiu can create such an outstanding miracle? Her creative process is the best answer: After the General Line was announced, the factory called on everyone to emancipate their minds, dare to think, dare to act, and break down conventions and restrictions. At this time, Lü Jinxiu thought: As a Party member, I should be at the forefront. I heard that someone at the Xi'an Textile Factory created a new record of overseeing seventy-two looms. Why can't I expand from sixteen looms? Just as she was beginning to consider her own leap forward methods, the general Party branch secretary of the workshop took the initiative to ask her: "Jinxiu, go ahead and be bold! How about you oversee thirty-two looms?" When Lü Jinxiu heard this, she was both happy and anxious. She was happy because it was exactly what she wanted, and anxious because she was worried about not being able to do it. Sure enough, because the number of looms had doubled, she couldn't keep up with the operation, and six pieces of substandard cloth were produced on the first day of overseeing thirty-two looms. Lü Jinxiu felt very sad about the loss to the country. At this time, the workshop leaders and comrades helped her, and after a week, she became more proficient in the operation. Just as she had a little confidence in overseeing thirty-two looms, the Party leadership came to her again: Jinxiu, how about doubling the number of looms again? She thought: Let's do it! The leaders and comrades trust me so much, what is there to be afraid of? In this way, time after time, she increased from the original sixteen looms to thirty-two, sixty-four, eighty… all the way up to two hundred and sixty-five looms. In order to adapt to this new situation, she let go and boldly experimented, changing the original long-distance patrol route to a segmented and small-curve route, reducing the patrol time from twelve minutes and forty seconds to eight minutes and thirty-nine seconds. The splicing time was also reduced from eighteen seconds to fourteen point six seconds. Originally, when overseeing sixteen looms, the substandard cloth rate was 11.61%, but when overseeing two hundred and sixty-five looms, the substandard cloth rate was reduced to 6.31%.
　　This is the process of Lü Jinxiu creating a miracle. The main reason why she was able to create this set of scientific operating methods is the support of the Party leadership and her communist style of daring to break the old and establish the new, and her spirit of selfless labor.

### 吕金秀看265台布机

专栏：大胆创造  大胆革新

　　吕金秀看265台布机
    山西晋华纺织厂看自动织布机的女青年工人吕金秀，从一人看十六台人工织布机，增加到管理自动织布机二百六十五台。
    吕金秀虽然是个有着十二年工龄的老工人，但是她管理织布机不过是近三、四年的事。特别是看管自动织布机仅仅只有一年多。像吕金秀这样缺乏经验的人，为什么能够创造如此出众的奇迹呢？她的创造经过就是最好的答案：总路线公布以后，厂里号召大家要解放思想、敢想、敢干、打破陈规戒律。这时，吕金秀就想：咱是个党员应该走在前面，听说西安纺织厂有人创造了看布机七十二台的新纪录，我怎么就只能看十六台不能扩台呢？当她正开始考虑自己的跃进办法的时候，车间总支部书记主动找来问她：“金秀，大胆干吧！给你看三十二台怎么样？”吕金秀一听心里真是又喜又急。喜的是正合心思：急的是耽心搞不成。果然，由于台数增加了一倍，操作赶不上，初看三十二台车的第一天就出了六匹次布。吕金秀对国家受到损失心里很难过。就在这时候，车间领导和同志们帮助了她，一个星期后，操作就比较熟练了。看三十二台，刚刚有了点把握，党的领导又来找她了：金秀，台数再加一倍如何？她想：干吧！领导和同志们这样信任自己，有什么可怕的呢？就这样，一次又一次地从原来的十六台增加到三十二台、六十四台、八十台……直到二百六十五台。为了适应这一新的情况，她放开手脚，大胆试验，把原来通长行进的巡回路线，改为分段和拐小弯绕行，使巡回期间由十二分四十秒减少到八分三十九秒。接头时间也由十八秒减少到十四点六秒。原来看十六台布机，次布为11.61％，看二百六十五台次布则降低到6.31％。
    这就是吕金秀创造奇迹的经过。她能创造这一套科学的操作方法，主要是党的领导支持和她敢于破旧立新的共产主义风格和忘我劳动的精神。（附图片）
