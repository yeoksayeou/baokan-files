　　Aunt Hong Runs a Canteen
    In a small, one-story house, seven or eight long tables are neatly arranged. Next to the stoves, over twenty plates of dishes are ready, including fried eggplant and shredded pickled vegetables. Beside them, an old lady is busy serving rice. She said to me with a smile: "This canteen was only set up half a month ago. You see, nothing is complete yet."
    She is the often-mentioned Aunt Hong. Aunt Hong is about fifty years old and very energetic. After the street's production team was organized, everyone wanted to run a canteen, but they could not find a house. Later, Aunt Hong discussed it with the Hufang Road Office and borrowed this room. Everyone contributed bowls and chopsticks and started selling meals on "August 1st."

　　洪老大娘办食堂
    一间不大的平房里，整整齐齐地摆着七、八张条桌，锅灶旁边盛好了二十多盘菜，有炒茄子，有咸菜丝。旁边，一位老大娘正在忙着盛饭。她笑嘻嘻地对我说：“这食堂是半个月前才搞起来的，你看，什么都不齐全。”
    她，就是人们常提到的洪老大娘。洪老大娘约摸五十多岁的年纪，精力很充沛。街道上的生产组组织起来后，大家都愿办个食堂，但因为没有房子，始终办不起来。后来，洪老大娘便和虎房路办事处商量，借了现在这间平房，各家凑了不少碗、筷，并在“八一”开始卖饭了。
