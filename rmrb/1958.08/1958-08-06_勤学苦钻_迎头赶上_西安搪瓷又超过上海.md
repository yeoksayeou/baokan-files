Diligent Study and Hard Work: Catching Up and Surpassing
    Xi'an Enamelware Surpasses Shanghai Again

    (Our dispatch) The product quality of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory is steadily improving. Recently, it has once again surpassed Shanghai enamel products, maintaining its position as number one in quality nationwide and catching up with advanced world technical levels. The product quality of this enamel factory is primarily distinguished by its dazzling gloss, measured at 130 degrees using a photometer. The adhesion strength, which indicates the firmness of the bond between the enamel and the iron base, has reached 100,000 grams, 35 degrees higher than the American standard and 90,000 grams stronger in adhesion. The acid and heat resistance performance has also caught up with that of enamelware from England, America, and Sweden. In destructive impact tests using a half-kilogram iron ball, the enamel basin was dented with a small pit, but the enamel did not peel off.
    In the past, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory learned from the experience of Shanghai and the national enamel industry, rapidly elevating its quality to the first place in the country. All factory workers are striving to consolidate and improve the quality level. In April, they pioneered the use of distilled water to mix enamel powder, which improved the enamel gloss. After the enamel gloss improved, they manufactured their own distillation machine to use distilled water to mix enamel powder, generally raising the enamel gloss from over 90 degrees to over 120 degrees. They also explored methods to increase adhesion. In June, the entire factory adopted a white undercoat production process, quickly increasing the adhesion from 12,000 kilograms to 100,000 kilograms. In the recent two to three months, the Shanghai enamel industry has also made significant progress, and the product quality of some advanced enamel factories had at one point caught up with the quality level of Xi'an enamel in March and April. However, due to the continuous progress of Xi'an enamel, its quality remains higher than that of Shanghai enamel.
    However, the variety of colors and designs of Xi'an enamel is far less rich and diverse than that of Shanghai. Currently, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory has invited Xi'an painters to design many paintings to catch up in terms of product aesthetics.

### 勤学苦钻　迎头赶上  西安搪瓷又超过上海

    勤学苦钻　迎头赶上
    西安搪瓷又超过上海
    本报讯　西安人民搪瓷厂的产品质量步步提高。最近又一次超过上海搪瓷品，在质量上仍然保持全国第一位，并赶上了世界先进技术水平。这个搪瓷厂的产品质量，首先是光泽耀人，用测光计测量已经达到一百三十度。标志搪瓷和铁坯结合牢度的密着力也达到十万克，比美国多三十五度，密着力则多九万克，而耐酸、耐热的性能也赶上了英、美、瑞典的搪瓷。他们用半公斤重的铁球做破坏性的冲击试验，搪瓷面盆被砸凹下去一个小坑，搪瓷并没有脱落。
    西安人民搪瓷厂过去学习上海和全国搪瓷工业的经验，迅速使质量跃居全国第一位，全厂职工都尽力巩固和提高质量水平。4月份，他们首创用蒸馏水调配珐琅粉，搪瓷光度提高以后，便自制蒸馏机，用蒸馏水调配珐琅粉，使搪瓷光度从九十多度普遍提高到一百二十度以上。另外摸索出增加密着力的经验，6月份，全厂全部采用白下引生产，使密着力很快从一万二千克逐渐增加到十万克。最近两三个月，上海搪瓷工业也有很大跃进，有些先进的搪瓷厂的产品质量曾一度赶上西安搪瓷3、4月份的质量水平。由于西安搪瓷又不断跃进，在质量上仍然高于上海搪瓷。
    但是，西安搪瓷的花色远不如上海丰富多采。目前，西安人民搪瓷厂曾邀请西安画家设计多幅画图，在产品美术化方面赶上去。
