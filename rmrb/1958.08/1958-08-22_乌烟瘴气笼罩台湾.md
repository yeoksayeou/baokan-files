    Under the instigation of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is creating tension in the Taiwan area and "intensifying war preparations," which has thrown Taiwan into turmoil and chaos.
    Chaos Reigns
    Since August 6, when the Chiang gang's Ministry of National Defense announced that all parts of Taiwan had entered a state of emergency war preparation, the Kuomintang organs in Taipei and other counties and cities of Taiwan have been in a state of panic, busy searching for "safe" places. Various emergency orders have been issued in succession. In the Chiang gang's officialdom in Taiwan, rumors are rife, and various legends and rumors are rampant.
    Recently, one night, a huge, round, luminous object was discovered on a beach in the suburbs of Taitung City. The Chiang gang's nervous police officers rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Before they could even see what it was, they fled in panic. As a result, rumors of a "mysterious weapon" being discovered on the beach and other rumors spread rapidly, and the families and concubines of Kuomintang bureaucrats rushed to escape. Kuomintang officials were in a state of frantic disarray. Later, a large number of so-called "specialized technicians" were sent to investigate and verify, and it was finally clarified that it was an abandoned bomb weighing more than 100 pounds that had drifted from the sea and been swept to the beach by the waves.
    Because the Chiang gang carries out war propaganda all day long, similar incidents of self-inflicted disturbance among Chiang gang bureaucrats have occurred more than once recently in Kaohsiung and Taipei.
    Forcible Demolition of Civilian Housing
    In Taiwan, the houses of many towns and villages have been forcibly demolished by demolition teams as fierce as wolves, causing many people to be displaced and wander the streets. On August 6, under the unified deployment of the Taiwan Garrison General Headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, an order was first announced to demolish the wooden houses in the vicinity of Zhonghua Road in Taipei. Most of the more than 170 households and more than 600 residents living in this area rely on setting up small stalls, shining shoes, or selling snacks to make a living. They go out to earn a living during the day and squeeze into small wooden sheds at night. After the news of the demolition spread, the residents there felt particularly panicked. Because once the wooden houses are demolished and the whole family is driven to the suburbs by the Chiang gang police, they will immediately face the misfortune of unemployment and starvation. They sent representatives to petition the Chiang Kai-shek clique, demanding that they take care of their livelihood difficulties, but the reply they received was still "demolition within a time limit." The demolition of these civilian houses is only the beginning. According to the emergency meeting held by the Chiang gang's Taiwan Garrison General Headquarters on August 12, in order to carry out war preparations, the demolition of houses will be intensified in the future. Thousands upon thousands of residents will have their houses demolished and become homeless in the Chiang gang's expansion of military bases and construction of fortifications.
    Troubled Waters
    The so-called "civil defense" organizations of the Chiang gang in various parts of Taiwan are also stepping up extortion and harassment of the people of Taiwan, implementing the so-called "thorough support of manpower and material resources for the front line" measures. At present, employees in the food, vegetable, grocery and other industries in Taipei, as well as rickshaw pullers, cart pullers, porters, doctors, nurses, etc., have been forced by the Chiang gang to form groups for training, forcing them to prepare to "support the front line" for the Chiang gang, causing widespread resentment among the people in various parts of Taiwan. Residents in various parts of Taiwan are also forced to dig fortifications day and night. Or they are often driven out of their homes by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's military police to participate in "war preparation" and other exercises.
    Taking advantage of this time of panic, the Chiang gang bureaucrats and military police personnel in various parts of Taiwan are taking the opportunity to extort and plunder, and forced donation activities with new tricks and numerous names are being intensified. Coupled with market chaos and the impact of panic buying and hoarding, the people of Taiwan have been plunged into an even more painful situation.
    "Competing for Money and Prostitution"
    Recently, the "sense of doomsday" among the senior bureaucrats of the Chiang Kai-shek clique has become more prominent than ever before. They often hold lavish banquets, spending thousands of dollars, as if they don't care about tomorrow night and would rather die drunk. Taiwan newspapers call them "as if the end is near." Recently, some restaurants in Taipei that attract customers with "hundreds of beauties" are often full, and most of the customers are Kuomintang corrupt officials and businessmen who collude with them. Many prostitutes, streetwalkers, social butterflies and concubines of Kuomintang bureaucrats also mingle among them. The Chiang gang's official newspaper, "Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily," had to admit that the current licentious and shameless life of senior officials of the Chiang gang in Taiwan has formed a situation of "competing for money and prostitution."

### 乌烟瘴气笼罩台湾

　　乌烟瘴气笼罩台湾
　　方元慧
    蒋介石集团在美国指使下在台湾地区制造紧张局势，“加紧备战”的活动，已经把台湾搞得风雨满城，乌烟瘴气。
    乱作一团
    自8月6日蒋帮国防部宣布台湾各地全部进入紧急备战状态，台北市和台湾其它县市的国民党机关便开始慌作一团了，都忙着寻找“安全”的场所。各种紧急命令在这时连续地发出来。在台湾蒋帮官场中，到处是风声鹤唳，各种传说和谣言蜂起。
    最近，在一个深夜里，有人在台东市郊区海滩上，发现了一个巨大的圆形发光物体。神色紧张的蒋帮警察人员闻讯赶到后，远远地还没有看清楚是什么东西，就惊慌逃走了。于是，海滩发现“神秘武器”的流言和其它谣传，迅速散布开了，国民党官僚的眷属和姨太太之类，都争先走避。国民党的官员们慌得手忙脚乱。后来，派出了大批所谓“专门技术人员”前往查验，才弄清楚原来是从海上漂来的一个一百多磅重的废炸弹，被风浪卷送到了海滩。
    由于蒋帮终日进行战争宣传，最近在高雄市和台北市，发生这类蒋帮官僚间自相惊扰的事件已经不只一件了。
    强拆民房
    在台湾，许多市镇的民房都被如狼似虎的拆屋大队强行拆除了，许多人为此流离失所，流浪街头。8月6日，在蒋介石集团台湾警备总司令部的统一部署下，首先公布了台北市中华路附近一带木屋的拆除命令。在这一带居住的一百七十多户六百多名居民，大部分都是靠摆小摊、擦皮鞋或卖零食等度日的。他们白天出外谋生，夜晚数家挤在一间小小的木棚里。拆除的消息传出后，那里的居民便格外地感到恐慌。因为，一旦木屋被拆，全家被蒋帮警察赶去郊区，他们立刻就要遭到失业和挨饿的厄运。他们派代表向蒋介石集团请愿，要求照顾他们谋生的困难，但得到的答复仍然是“限期拆迁”。这批民房的拆除，还仅仅是个开始，根据蒋帮台湾警备总司令部8月12日召开的紧急会议决定，为了进行备战活动，往后还要加紧拆屋。将有成千上万的居民在蒋帮扩大军事基地和修筑工事中被拆除房屋，无家可归。
    混水摸鱼
    台湾各地蒋帮的所谓“民防”机构，也正在加紧向台湾人民敲诈勒索和百般骚扰，执行所谓“人力物力彻底支援前线”的措施。目前，台北市的粮食、蔬菜、杂货等行业的职工和三轮车、板车、搬运工人、医生护士等，都已经被蒋帮强迫编组训练，硬逼他们准备替蒋帮
  “支援前线”，弄得台湾各地民怨沸腾。台湾各地的居民，还被迫不分日夜去挖工事。或者常常被蒋介石集团的军警从家里赶出来，参加“备战”等演习。
    台湾各地的蒋帮官僚和军警人员，趁着这个人心惶惶的时候，则乘机敲诈搜刮，花样翻新名目繁多的强迫捐献活动正在加紧进行。加上市场混乱，抢购囤积的影响，台湾人民已经更加陷入了痛苦不堪的境地。
    “争钱竞娼”
    最近一个时期，蒋介石集团的高级官僚们的“末日感”，比过去任何时候都更加突出。他们常常大开筵席，一挥千金，大有过了今晚不问明朝，醉死方休的样子。台湾报纸称他们“一若末日之将至”。最近台北市一些以“百名美女”等招徕顾客的酒楼饭店，常常客满，大部分顾客都是国民党的贪官污吏以及和他们互相勾结的商人。许多娼妓、流莺、交际花和国民党官僚的姨太太等，也周旋于其间。蒋帮机关报“台湾新生报”不得不承认，目前台湾蒋帮高级官员生活的荒淫无耻，已经形成了一个“争钱竞娼”的局面。
