Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 19th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the People's Chamber this morning that the Western countries' proposals regarding West Asia at the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session ignored the fundamental fact that foreign troops should withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. He reiterated, "The problems there cannot be resolved until foreign troops withdraw."

Prime Minister Nehru was the first to speak in the People's Chamber during a day-long debate on international affairs and Indian foreign policy. He said, "Making the withdrawal of troops conditional does not seem to be the right approach." He said that the deployment of troops to West Asia was not due to events in Lebanon or Jordan, but actually "due to events in Iraq." He said that Iraq is stable and its popular government has been recognized by many countries.

Prime Minister Nehru said that India agrees to strengthen the UN observer group in Lebanon and send observers to Jordan. "But we have made it clear that we do not agree to send police forces there in the name of the United Nations or any other name."

He said that there is a "strange situation" in Lebanon, where President Chamoun, who continues to hold office, has no intention of asking the US military to withdraw.

He pointed out that "the problems of Asia and Africa cannot be solved by military means," nor can they be solved by oppressing the local people. He reiterated: "Any solution to the West Asia problem must be readily agreed to and cooperated with by the West Asian countries."

He believes that the main countries concerned should have appropriate representation in the United Nations. He said that the diplomatic activities currently being carried out in the United Nations are being consulted with the people of West Asia the least, while "their fate is being decided in faraway New York."

Regarding this, he also said: "As far as the United Nations is concerned, there is no representative of the People's Republic of China there. This is an abnormal thing. The United Nations has ignored this important fact."

When Nehru spoke about US President Eisenhower's statement in his speech to the UN General Assembly regarding giving "economic assistance" to West Asian countries, he pointed out that doing so cannot put aside the main political issues.

Nehru finally reminded everyone of the harmful effects of recent nuclear tests and nuclear radiation as pointed out in the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation report. He also emphasized that continuing to use military means to deal with various problems in the world is dangerous.

In his speech, Nehru also said that he agreed to hold talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Noon in September this year on the Indo-Pakistan border issue.

Nehru will reply on August 20 to the People's Chamber's discussion on international affairs and foreign policy issues.

### 尼赫鲁抨击西方国家在联大提案　美英必须无条件撤军

　　尼赫鲁抨击西方国家在联大提案
　　美英必须无条件撤军
    新华社新德里19日电  印度总理尼赫鲁今天上午在人民院说，西方国家在联合国大会紧急特别会议上提出的关于西亚的提案忽视了外国军队应当从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退的基本事实。他再一次说，“在外国军队撤退以前，那里的问题不可能得到解决。”
    尼赫鲁总理在人民院就国际事务和印度外交政策进行一天的辩论时第一个发言。他说，“把撤军变成有条件的做法看来并不是正确的。”他说，派军队到西亚去并不是由于在黎巴嫩或约旦发生的事件，而实际上是“由于在伊拉克发生的事件”。他说，伊拉克是稳定的，它的得人心的政府已经得到好些国家的承认。
    尼赫鲁总理说，印度同意加强联合国在黎巴嫩的观察团，并且派观察员前往约旦。“但是我们清楚地表示，我们不同意以联合国或任何其他名义派警察部队到那里去”。
    他说，在黎巴嫩出现了“奇怪的情况”，在那里，继续担任总统的夏蒙无意要求美军撤退。
    他指出，“亚非的问题不能用军事手段来解决”，也不能通过压迫当地人民的办法来解决。他再次强调说：“任何解决西亚问题的办法都必须得到西亚国家的欣然同意和合作”。
    他认为，主要有关国家在联合国中应当有适当的代表。他说，在联合国中现在进行的外交活动跟西亚人民商量得最少，而“他们的命运却正在遥远的纽约来加以决定”。
    关于这一点，他还说：“就联合国来说，那里没有中华人民共和国的代表。这是一件反常的事。联合国忽视了这一重要事实”。
    尼赫鲁谈到美国总统艾森豪威尔在联合国大会的演说中关于给予西亚国家以“经济援助”的说法时指出，这样做也不能把主要的政治问题放在一边。
    尼赫鲁最后提醒大家注意联合国原子辐射影响科学委员会报告中所指出的关于最近的核试验和核放射所造成的有害影响。他还着重指出了继续用军事手段来处理世界上的各种问题的作法是危险的。
    尼赫鲁在发言中还说，他同意在今年9月同巴基斯坦总理努恩就印巴边境问题举行会谈。
    尼赫鲁将在8月20日就人民院关于国际事务和外交政策问题的讨论进行答辩。
