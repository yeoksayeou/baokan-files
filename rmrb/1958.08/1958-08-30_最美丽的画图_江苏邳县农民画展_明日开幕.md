The Most Beautiful Pictures
	“Jiangsu Pixian Peasant Painting Exhibition” to Open Tomorrow
	(Our newspaper reports) Just like the countless miracles created in industrial and agricultural construction, the hardworking and brave Chinese people have also created great miracles in art. Without professional art talents, the peasants themselves create murals, and in some counties it has formed a mass movement. This is unprecedented in the world.
	The mural movement of peasants in Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, is a major event in China's revolutionary art cause. In the propaganda movement of the General Line, under the specific leadership of the county party committee, they used painting as a weapon of propaganda and mobilization. Currently, they have completed 100,500 murals and 78,000 posters, which have greatly promoted agricultural production and industrial construction. In May, the Jiangsu Provincial Mass Art Museum held a training class for fine arts cadres from cultural centers and stations in Xuzhou and Huaiyin Special Districts in the county. Only three people from Pixian participated in the study. After graduation, they naturally became the backbone of art activities. Most townships and communes do not have such conditions. They mobilized talents who "know how to draw" and now more than 15,000 people are participating in art activities. There are eleven and twelve-year-old children, as well as carpenters, lantern makers, and old folk paper-cutting ladies over seventy years old. Their material conditions are very poor. Some places fry red clay as red pigment, or grind bricks burnt red in the kiln into powder and fry them as red pigment, use soot from chimneys as black, use lime as white, and use chlorophyll extracted from leaves as green. If there are no paintbrushes, they find some pig bristles and tie them into paintbrushes. At the beginning, they also copied things from picture albums or comic books, but soon they abandoned these "painting books" because the copied things could not be combined with their actual situation. Based on their own life experiences, based on actual needs and the requirements of the masses, and also based on great and beautiful life ideals and fantasies, they boldly and heroically create, fully demonstrating the talent and wisdom of the working people. Revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism have achieved vivid expression in their works. Pixian plans to establish a fine arts association to organize peasant painters, and plans to establish art schools and set up fine arts classes. In this mural movement, a large number of excellent painters who truly come from the working class will undoubtedly emerge.
	Not long ago, the Beijing People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the editorial department of the "Fine Arts" monthly magazine organized temporary editorial groups to interview various townships in Pixian County. The Chinese Artists Association organized an internal viewing meeting for members in Beijing on the works brought back by these two groups, and Comrade Wang Chaowen and others gave a briefing. In order to allow more audiences to see these works, the Chinese Artists Association, the Nanjing Branch of the Artists Association, and the Pixian Cultural Center will hold the "Jiangsu Pixian Peasant Painting Exhibition" at the Shuaifuyuan Art Exhibition Hall from the 31st. 191 peasant posters and more than 60 photos of peasant murals will be exhibited. The Artists Association is also preparing to hold a forum to organize artists to study these works. (Attached picture)

　　最美丽的画图
    “江苏邳县农民画展”明日开幕
    本报讯　正像在工农业建设方面创造的无数奇迹一样，勤劳勇敢的中国人民在艺术上也创造了伟大的奇迹。没有专业的美术人材，农民自己动手来创作壁画，而且在某些县份形成了全民性的运动，这在全世界也是史无前例的。
    江苏邳县农民的壁画运动，是我国革命美术事业中的一件大事。在总路线的宣传运动中，他们在县委的具体领导下，把绘画作为宣传鼓动的武器，目前已完成壁画十万零五千幅、张贴画七万八千幅，对于农业生产和工业建设起了巨大的促进作用。5月间，江苏省群众艺术馆在该县举办徐州、淮阴两个专区文化馆、站美术干部训练班，邳县参加学习的只有三个人，他们毕业后，当然成了美术活动的骨干。绝大部分乡社并没有这样的条件，他们把“会画道道”的人材都发动起来了，目前已有一万五千多人参加美术活动。有十一、二岁的孩子，也有木匠、扎彩匠，以及年过七十的民间剪纸老大娘。他们的物质条件很差，有的地方把红泥炒了当红色，或把窑里烧红了的砖磨成粉炒了当红色，用烟囱里的煤烟子当黑色，用石灰当白色，用树叶打出来的叶绿素当绿色。没有画笔就找了一些猪鬃捆成画笔。开始的时候，他们也根据画报或连环画册等临摹一些东西，但很快地他们抛开这些“画本子”，因为临摹的东西不能结合他们的实际。根据自己的生活体会，根据实际的需要和群众的要求，同时也根据伟大和美丽的生活理想和幻想，他们大胆而且豪迈地进行创作，充分表现了劳动人民的天才和智慧。革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义，在他们的作品上取得了生动的表现。邳县已计划成立美术协会，把农民画家组织起来，并计划创办艺术学校、设立美术班。在这个壁画运动中，无疑会产生出大批优秀的、真正出身于劳动阶级的画家。
    不久前，北京人民美术出版社和“美术”月刊编辑部，都先后组织了临时编辑小组到邳县各乡镇采访。中国美术家协会就这两个小组带回的作品，组织了一次在京会员内部观摹会，并由王朝闻等同志作了情况介绍。为了让更多的观众都能看到这些作品，中国美术家协会、美协南京分会和邳县文化馆，在帅府园美术展览馆自31日起举办“江苏省邳县农民画展”。展出农民张贴画一百九十一幅，农民壁画照片六十余件，美协还准备召开座谈会组织美术家来研究学习这些作品。（附图片）
