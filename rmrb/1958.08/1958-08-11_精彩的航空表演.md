　　Wonderful Air Show
　　By Our Reporter
    Yesterday, the weather was clear and cloudless. More than 30,000 spectators in the capital happily watched a wonderful aviation sports performance at the Xijiao Airport. This performance was organized by the Beijing National Defense Sports Association to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day.
    The most eye-catching and thrilling performances yesterday were the twin-jet fighter aerobatics and the single-jet fighter aerobatics. Just after the helicopter performance, two small black dots appeared in the southern sky above the airport. These were the jet fighters performing aerobatics. In an instant, the two aircraft swept across the sky at near supersonic speed. Then they performed stunts such as steep turns and somersaults. The coordination of the two aircraft was so harmonious, as if one person was controlling them. Sometimes they swooped down to a few hundred feet above the ground, and sometimes they rose sharply to three or four thousand meters. Their amazing speed meant that the audience sometimes couldn't even find their踪迹. As soon as the two aircraft left the airport, a jet silver eagle made in China swept past the audience. This single aircraft continuously performed ascending rolls, somersaults, inverted flight and other actions at an altitude of three or four thousand meters. One somersault covered several thousand meters, and the movements were skilled and the performance was very exciting.
    The helicopter performance also aroused great interest among the audience. A green helicopter took off slowly. When it flew to the middle of the airport, only the rotor was seen spinning, but the fuselage remained stationary in the air. This was a relatively difficult maneuver, and the audience applauded and cheered for this performance. Then it performed horizontal left and right flight, 360-degree turns in the original position, backward flight, and vertical ascent and descent. These actions, which other types of aircraft cannot perform, aroused great curiosity among the audience. During the vertical descent performance, when the aircraft was five meters above the ground, the door opened, a rope ladder was lowered, and an athlete climbed down the rope ladder and handed a helicopter model to the person in charge of the Beijing National Defense Sports Association as a gift to the meeting.
    A total of fifteen programs were performed in three hours. In addition to jet fighter aerobatics and helicopter performances, other programs such as advanced gliders and parachuting, aviation models, elementary and intermediate gliders, and Yak-18 single and double aircraft aerobatics were also welcomed by the audience.

　　精彩的航空表演
　　本报记者
    昨日，天气晴朗，万里无云。在西郊机场上首都三万多观众愉快地观看了一场精彩的航空体育表演。这场表演是北京市国防体育协会为了庆祝“八一”建军节而组织的。
    昨天的表演中，最引人注意、扣人心弦的是喷气歼击机双机特技表演和喷气歼击机单机特技表演。直升飞机表演刚完，两个小黑点出现在机场南方上空，这就是表演特技的喷气歼击机。转瞬间，双机以接近超音速的速度掠空而过。接着作大坡度转变、翻斤斗等特技。双机配合的是那样协调一致，好像一个人在操纵着。它们忽而俯冲到几百尺高空，忽而又急遽上升到三四千公尺。它们那惊人的速度，观众有时竟找不到它们的踪迹。双机才离开机场，一架我国自制的喷气银鹰又从观众眼前掠过。这架单机，在三四千公尺高空连续做上升横滚、翻斤斗、倒飞等动作。一个斤斗就是几千公尺，动作熟练，表演十分精彩。
    直升飞机的表演也引起了观众很大的兴趣。一架绿色的直升飞机缓慢地起飞了。飞到机场中间，只见螺旋桨在转，机身却停在空中不动了。这是一个比较难做的动作，观众为这一表演不断鼓掌喝采。接着它表演了机身横着左右飞行、原位置三百六十度转弯、倒退飞行、直升直降等。这些为其他种飞机所不能做的动作，引起观众很大的好奇。在表演直线下降中，当飞机离地五公尺时，机门打开，放下一个软梯，一个运动员顺着软梯爬下来，把一个直升飞机模型，交给北京市国防体协负责人，作为向大会的献礼。
    在三个小时内共进行了十五个节目。除喷气歼击机特技、直升飞机表演外，其他像高级滑翔机和跳伞、航空模型、初、中级滑翔机、雅克18单双机特技等节目也都受到观众的欢迎。（附图片）
