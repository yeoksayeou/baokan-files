    Good Health, High Production
    The "July 1st" Cotton Mill in Xinjiang Does a Good Job in Sports
    (Our report) The three thousand five hundred staff members of all ethnicities at the Xinjiang "July 1st" Cotton Mill have generally participated in various sports activities, with over 85% of the total factory population consistently exercising daily. Many older workers, cooks, childcare workers, and party and government leaders within the factory, who rarely participated in sports in the past, have become active figures on the sports field. The total number of sports teams in the factory has surged from 38 last year to 83, encompassing over 20 different events.
    The Party Committee of the "July 1st" Cotton Mill adopted a series of measures, including leaders taking the lead personally, rectifying sports organizations at all levels, establishing regular competition, visits, and evaluation systems, and organizing amateur sports forums and study sessions, enabling the factory's sports activities to develop rapidly and vigorously.
    After the comprehensive launch of sports work, the spirit of all staff and workers at the "July 1st" Cotton Mill has been greatly enhanced, the number of sick individuals has significantly decreased, and the attendance rate has further improved. According to statistics, due to the widespread promotion of sports exercises and the elimination of the "Four Pests" and emphasis on hygiene activities, the number of outpatient visits in the second quarter of this year has decreased by nearly two-thirds compared to the same period last year. For example, Zhao Yulan, a female worker in the weaving and finishing workshop, used to frequently request leave for night shifts due to poor physical condition. However, after consistently participating in calisthenics and basketball for over three months, her physical strength has significantly improved, and she no longer requests leave due to poor physical condition.

    身体好　生产高
    新疆七一棉纺厂体育开展得好
    本报讯　新疆七一棉纺织厂的三千五百多名各族职工，目前，已普遍参加了各项体育活动，天天坚持锻炼的已达到全厂总人数的85％以上。许多过去很少参加体育活动的老工人、炊事员、保育员和厂内的党政领导干部也都变成了运动场上的活跃分子。全厂的各种运动队已从去年的三十八个骤增至八十三个，包括了二十多种项目。
    七一棉纺织厂党委会采取了领导亲自带头、整顿各级体育组织、建立经常性的竞赛、参观、评比等制度，组织业余体育座谈会、学习会等一系列措施，使全厂的体育活动很快就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    体育工作全面开展后，使七一棉纺织厂的全体职工精神更加振作，生病的人显著减少，出勤率进一步提高。据统计，今年全厂职工由于广泛开展了体育锻炼和除四害讲卫生等活动，第二季度看病的人次已比去年同期减少了将近三分之二。例如织整车间的女工赵玉兰，过去常因体力不好请假不上夜班，三个多月来坚持参加广播操和篮球运动后，体力已显著增强，现在已再不因为体力不好请假了。（丁文）
