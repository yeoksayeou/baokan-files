According to Jiangxi Daily, cadres at all levels and the broad masses in Nanchang County, Jiangxi are using even greater enthusiasm than during flood prevention and rescue to vigorously manage the late rice and autumn crops in the fields.

After the county achieved a high yield of over 800 jin per mu of early rice, some cadres and masses became complacent and indifferent to late rice, resulting in a passive situation of only managing planting and not harvesting. Under the influence of this thinking, in the Shawa Commune, over 400 mu of second-season late rice had not yet been top-dressed, and only 68 mu had been weeded once.

In response to these situations, the Nanchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on cadres throughout the county to bring the same spirit used in flood prevention and rescue to autumn production. The specific method is to persist in the "Nine On the Fields" system implemented during the "Double Rush" (early rice harvest and late rice planting) campaign: (1) cadres and the masses all go to the fields, stick to the battlefield, and spend the night in the fields; (2) telephones and offices are moved to the fields; (3) tea and meals are delivered to the fields; (4) grass sheds are built in the fields; (5) production tools are brought to the fields; (6) bed boards and bamboo beds are moved to the fields; (7) doctors and peddlers go to the fields; (8) barbers go to the fields; (9) political mobilization work goes to the fields.

After these measures were implemented, a new situation emerged in autumn production throughout the county. Many leaders and cadres moved to the fields to work and live, fighting day and night with the masses. Under the in-depth leadership of the cadres, more than 80,000 men and women laborers turned out every day to carry out field management work such as weeding, top-dressing, pest control, and drought resistance on more than 760,000 mu of late rice and 110,000 mu of late autumn crops. Statistics up to the 9th of the month show that nearly 470,000 mu of late rice had been weeded once, more than 220,000 mu had been weeded twice, and another 47,000 mu had been weeded three times.

　　用防洪抢险的干劲抓秋田
    南昌县干部坚持“九上田”制度
    据江西日报消息  江西南昌县各级干部和广大群众正用比防洪抢险时更大的干劲，狠狠地抓晚稻和秋作物的田间管理。
    该县在早稻获得亩产八百余斤的大丰收后，在部分干部和群众中，出现了骄傲自满情绪，对晚稻抱着无所谓的态度，结果又形成了管种不管收的消极局面。沙窝社在这种思想的支配下，四百多亩二季晚稻，到目前尚没有追肥，只有六十八亩耘了一次。
    针对这些情况，中共南昌县委号召全县干部拿出防洪抢险的干劲来搞秋季生产。具体办法是：把在“双抢”运动中实行的“九上田”（即（一）干部和群众都上田，坚持战地，夜宿田间；（二）电话机和办公室都搬上田；（三）茶饭送上田；（四）草棚搭上田；（五）生产工具上田；（六）床板、竹床搬上田；（七）医生、货郎担上田；（八）剃头担子上田；（九）政治鼓动工作上田）的制度，坚持下去。
    这些措施实现后，全县在秋季生产中，出现了一个崭新的局面。许多领导和干部，都搬到田间去办公、住宿，和群众一起日夜奋战。在干部的深入领导下，全县每天有八万多男女劳力出勤，对七十六万余亩晚稻和十一万余亩晚秋作物，进行耘禾、追肥、灭虫、抗旱等田间管理工作。全县到9日统计，近四十七万亩晚稻耘完了一次禾，有二十二万余亩耘了二次，还有四万七千余亩耘过了三次。
