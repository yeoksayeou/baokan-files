    The 社员 New Village
    One day, an old man with a white beard flowing on his chest, leaning on a crutch, came to the front of the newly built ninety buildings of the First Branch of the Fenghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hongxi Township, Xichong County, Sichuan. He carefully looked back and forth at the two rows of neat black-tiled, white-walled houses, the sturdy foundations built with large millstones, the wide doors and windows, as well as the collective canteen, public toilets, etc., nodding repeatedly, muttering to himself, "The Communist Party is so good, they do what they say."
    These houses were built by the Hongxi Township Basic Construction Brigade. They demolished the dilapidated old houses that were scattered everywhere, used some of the old materials, and built ninety new one-story buildings here. In addition, they built five cooperative office buildings and a hydroelectric power station. Now all the 社员 of the Fenghuo First Branch have moved into new houses. The Basic Construction Team's club and the branch office held an evening party to celebrate the 社员's housewarming. At the meeting, the 社员 sang a moving ballad based on their personal experiences:
    Thinking of the past, living in dilapidated houses, tears streaming.
    Sleeping at night, looking at the moon, the whole family squeezed onto one bed.
    When a strong wind comes, it rattles everywhere, and when it rains, we have to lift the bed.
    Now, full of joy, every household lives in a new house.
    Brick and stone pillars, glass windows, kitchen, bedroom and auditorium.
    Never forget Chairman Mao, always follow the Communist Party. (with picture)

    社员新村
    有一天，一位胸前飘着一部白须的老人，拄着拐杖，来到四川西充县虹溪乡烽火农业生产合作社一分社新建的九十幢楼房前面。他仔细地来回打量着这两排整齐的黑瓦白墙的房屋，用大磨石砌成的坚固的墙基，宽阔的门窗，以及集体食堂、公共厕所等等，连连点头，不住地自言自语：“共产党真是好，既说到就做到。”
    这些房子是虹溪乡基本建设大队盖起来的。他们把原来分散在各处的破烂不堪的旧房拆掉，利用了部分旧材料，在这里建起九十幢一楼一底的新房。另外还修了五幢社办公用房，一座水力发电站。现在烽火一分社全体社员都搬进了新房。基建队俱乐部和分社办公室，为了庆祝社员乔迁之喜，举行过晚会。在会上社员们以自己的亲身体会，唱了一首动人的歌谣：
    想从前，住烂房，眼泪汪汪。
    晚上睡觉看月亮，一家大小挤一床。
    遇到大风到处响，碰到下雨就抬床。
    到而今，喜洋洋，家家户户住新房。
    砖石柱头玻璃窗，灶房寝室和礼堂。
    永远不忘毛主席，永远跟着共产党。（附图片）
