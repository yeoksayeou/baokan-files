Several Methods for Cellaring Sweet Potatoes

    Simple Indoor Storage Method

In some areas where the terrain is low-lying and there is too much groundwater to dig cellars, the method of stacking sweet potatoes indoors surrounded by bricks can be adopted for storage. First, choose a room that is high-lying and relatively dry, and build a rectangular enclosure with bricks. The width and height of the wall can be determined according to the number of sweet potatoes to be stored. Spread a layer of dry plant ash or charcoal ash more than one inch thick on the ground, and then place the sweet potatoes on the ash; after each layer of sweet potatoes is placed, cover it with a layer of ash. Stack it to the top and then cover it with a thicker layer of ash to seal it, and then cover the top with straw to prevent cold air from attacking. Damaged sweet potato pieces should not be piled in during stacking. Although this method does not store as long as a cellar, it is relatively simple and easy to implement, and can also prevent mold and spoilage for 3 to 6 months.

    简易的室内贮存法
    有些地区形势低洼，地下水多不能挖窖时，可以采用室内围砖堆存办法来贮藏甘薯。首先选好地势高又比较干燥的房间，用砖砌成长方形的围墙、墙的阔度高度可根据需要贮藏的数量多少来决定。地面上铺一层一寸以上厚的干燥草木灰或炭灰，灰上放甘薯；以后每放一层甘薯就盖一层灰，堆至顶端再盖一层较厚的灰封闭，上面再加盖稻草，以防冷气袭击。堆存时破烂损伤的薯块均不得堆入。这个办法虽然没有地窖贮得久，但比较简单易行，也可以保持3——6个月不会霉坏。
