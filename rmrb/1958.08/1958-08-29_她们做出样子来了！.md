　　They are setting an example!
　　Yu Zhengzhou
    The example of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory workers' families organizing themselves for production is strongly attracting people's attention. After seeing the factories, canteens, and nurseries they have built with their own hands, people are invariably encouraged. After the celebration, a valuable insight was gained: once women's labor is liberated, it immediately becomes a huge force on the production front.
    The vast majority of people warmly welcome and actively support such a great thing, but there are also a few people who stand by with folded arms and treat it lightly.
    The characteristic of skeptics is that they observe everything. Before the workers' families organized production, they said: "What great things can housewives accomplish? Just stay at home and revolve around the stove!" After the families implemented the socialization of housework and participated in production, their tone changed, and they said: "Look at them, noisy and clamorous, housewives have no culture, no technology, running a factory will collapse sooner or later!" In a word, they do not see women's labor enthusiasm, nor do they believe that housewives can make a direct contribution to society, housewives can only revolve around the stove. However, how can some broken bricks and tiles block the tide of history? The more skeptics doubt, the more they will run into walls.
    The workers' families of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, with one voice saying they wanted to run factories and engage in production, fought hard for three days and three nights and built many small factories such as chemical factories, alcohol factories, wood factories, and paper mills with their own hands. More than 1,400 women's labor forces jumped out of the circle of housework and participated in social labor. A group of housewives with no culture and no technology have actually learned some basic industrial technologies and scientific knowledge in a few days, or even in a few hours, and immediately applied this knowledge to production. If they want to run an alcohol factory, they learn the technology of making alcohol; if they want to make chemical boards, they make chemical boards. Housewives act as factory directors and workers, they do a good job, and they do it with success. And it's not just that, their thinking has also undergone tremendous changes. Organized labor production has made the housewives who used to live a loose life rapidly develop collectivist thinking, and a new type of relationship of "everyone for me, me for everyone" has emerged. The changes in the mental outlook of housewives are truly one day equals twenty years.
    This is a miracle. But there is no need to be surprised, miracles naturally appear with the objective laws of social development. The reason is very simple, first, the situation of the Great Leap Forward requires the vast number of women to be liberated from housework and create wealth for society; second, housewives actively demand to get rid of tedious housework, participate in socialist construction, and achieve true equality with men, completely liberating themselves; third, after housewives are organized, they not only liberate productivity from small families, but also break superstitions and liberate their minds. They say: "We have the leadership of the Party, and we have the drive, what can't we do! Others can do it, so can we, as long as we dare to think and dare to do, we can surpass the immortals." That is exactly the case, our Party believes that the masses can liberate themselves, and women are no exception. Under the leadership of the Party, with objective needs and conscious soaring enthusiasm, miracles will inevitably appear, which is exactly "events are inevitable, the trend is bound to succeed," there is nothing to be surprised about.
    What is strange is why skeptics are always blind and deaf to new things? They see new things without realizing their newness, or even if they realize its newness, they do not see its vitality. Therefore, they are unwilling to actively support it, and dare not support it, for fear of dragging themselves down. Here, it is the skeptics themselves who are weak, not the most vital new things. What is worth advising skeptics is that the rapid growth of new things naturally requires people's active support, but it does not cease to exist because someone doubts, is indifferent, or makes comments. People who often observe new things with a skeptical eye will ultimately run into walls in the face of facts.
    The deeds of the families of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory are just an example for the skeptics to see. In fact, many families across the country are taking big strides on the road of labor socialization, life collectivization, and ideological communization under the leadership of the Party. With iron-like facts in front of them, what are the skeptics still doubting?

　　她们做出样子来了！
　　于正周
    郑州纺织机械厂职工家属组织起来搞生产的事例，强烈地吸引着人们的注意。人们看过她们亲手办的工厂、食堂、托儿所以后，莫不受到鼓舞。欢庆之后，还得到了一个可贵的启示：妇女的劳动力一经解放出来，就立刻成为生产战线上一支巨大力量。
    对这样一件大好事，绝大多数人热烈地欢迎它，积极支持它，然而也有少数人冷眼旁观，等闲视之。
    怀疑论者的特点，就是事事都要观望。职工家属没有组织生产以前，他们说：“家庭妇女能成什么大事？还是在家当‘锅台转’吧！”，家属们实行了家务劳动社会化，参加生产以后，他们的腔调一变，又说：“你看她们吵吵嚷嚷的，家庭妇女没文化，没技术，搞工厂早晚要垮台！”一句话，他们看不见妇女的劳动积极性，也不相信家庭妇女能够对社会作出直接的贡献，家庭妇女只能围着锅台转。但是，一些碎石片瓦怎能挡得住历史的潮流？怀疑论者多怀疑一次，不过是多碰壁一次而已。
    郑州纺织机械厂的职工家属，一声说要办工厂、搞生产，就苦战三天三夜用自己的双手办起了化工厂、酒精厂、木工厂、造纸厂等许多小型工厂。一千四百多个妇女劳动力跳出了家务劳动的圈子，参加到社会劳动中来。一群没文化、没技术的家庭妇女，竟然在几天之内，甚至用几个小时的时间学会了一些基本工业技术和科学知识，并且立刻把这些知识用到生产上去。她们要办酒精厂，就学会了制造酒精的技术，要做化学板，就做出了化学板；家庭妇女当厂长、当工人，她们干得好，干得有成绩。事情还不仅是这样，她们的思想上也发生了巨大的变化。有组织的劳动生产，使得过去生活散漫的家庭妇女迅速地成长着集体主义思想，一种“人人为我，我为人人”的新型关系出现了。家庭妇女精神面貌的变化，真是一天等于二十年。
    这是奇迹。但是，这用不着奇怪，奇迹是随着社会发展的客观规律自然出现的。道理很简单，第一，大跃进的形势需要广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，给社会创造财富；第二，家庭妇女积极要求摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，参加社会主义建设，取得和男人真正平等的地位，彻底解放自己；第三，家庭妇女组织起来以后，不仅从小家庭中解放出生产力，同时也破除迷信，解放了思想。她们说：“我们有党的领导，又有干劲，什么干不了！别人能干我们也能干，只要我们敢想敢做，就能赛过神仙。”事情正是如此，我们党是相信群众能够自己解放自己的，妇女也不例外。在党的领导下，有客观需要，又有自觉的冲天干劲，奇迹必然要出现，这正是“事有必然，势所必成”，没有什么值得奇怪。
    奇怪的倒是，怀疑论者为什么老是对新鲜事物视而不见，听而不闻？他们看见了新东西不觉其新，或者虽然也觉到了它的新，却看不到它的生命力。因此不愿积极去扶持它，不敢扶持它，生怕因此拖累了自己。这里，软弱的正是这些怀疑论者自己，而并不是那最有生命力的新事物。值得奉劝怀疑论者们的是：新事物的迅速生长自然需要人的积极扶持，但它却并不因为有人怀疑、冷淡或是评头论足就不存在了。经常用怀疑的眼光去观察新鲜事物的人，终归是自己要在事实面前碰壁的。
    郑州纺织机械厂家属们的事迹，只不过是摆给怀疑派看的一个样子。实际上，全国各地正有不少家属在党的领导下大踏步地走上了劳动社会化、生活集体化、思想共产主义化的道路，铁一般的事实摆在面前，怀疑论者还怀疑什么？
