Column: Letters from Readers

    The work style of Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau has improved
    To the editor of People's Daily, and to Lin Chuntai:
    Qingdao Daily forwarded your letter of March 28th to us in April, and we did not reply in a timely manner. Later, People's Daily published your letter on June 4th criticizing our bureau for ignoring the opinions of the masses. We believe this criticism is completely correct. We will certainly strengthen our mass perspective and do a good job in handling letters from the masses in the future.
    In addition to apologizing to you, we also declare that we will resume door-to-door collection of newspaper and magazine subscription fees from June 1st, and implement methods such as telephone subscriptions and one newspaper for two households to facilitate readers and meet the needs of the vast number of readers.
          Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Shandong Province

    青岛邮电局的作风改进了
    人民日报编辑并转
    林春泰同志：
    青岛日报在4月份转来你3月28日的来信，我们没有及时答复。后来人民日报又在6月4日发表你批评我局对群众意见置之不理的来信，我们认为这一批评完全正确。今后我们一定加强群众观点，做好群众来信工作。
    我们除了向你致歉外，并声明从6月1日起恢复上门收订报刊费，并实行电话订报和一报两投等办法，以方便读者，满足广大读者的需要。
          山东省青岛市邮电局
