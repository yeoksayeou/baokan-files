    We Are Free!
    Bai Yatie, Iraq
    A red sun rises in Baghdad,
    Bells praise the heroes.
    Wake up, my love,
    We are free—
    Like flames,
    Like birds,
    Like the sun above our homeland.
    No more walls to separate us,
    The tyrant's death knell has rung,
    The shackles are shattered—we are free,
    Like flames,
    Like birds,
    Like the sun above our homeland.
    The Iraqi people are stronger than ever,
    They are stronger than the king's bayonets.
    Our homeland's army has unbound the shackles from us,
    The sons of the people are like the waves of the sea,
    Embracing each other.
    Wake up, my love,
    We are free!
    Flowers bloom in our beloved land,
    Bells praise the heroes!

    我们自由了！
    伊拉克  白雅帖
    在巴格达升起一轮红日，
    钟声在赞美英雄。
    醒来吧，亲爱的，
    我们——自由了，
    像火焰，
    像小鸟，
    像祖国上空的太阳一样。
    再也没有墙垣把我们隔开，
    暴君的丧钟已响了，
    枷锁被砸碎——我们自由了，
    像火焰，
    像小鸟，
    像祖国上空的太阳一样。
    伊拉克人民空前强大，
    他们比国王的刺刀还坚强。
    我们祖国的军队从我们身上解下枷锁，
    人民的儿子们如同那大海的波浪，
    互相拥抱。
    醒来吧，亲爱的，
    我们——自由了！
    在我们亲爱的土地上鲜花盛开，
    钟声在赞美英雄！
    〔注〕白雅帖是现代伊拉克伟大的进步诗人。世界和平理事会文化问题常设委员会委员。在努里·赛义德统治伊拉克时，曾不止一次被抓进集中营和监狱，被流放。现在诗人正在苏联。
