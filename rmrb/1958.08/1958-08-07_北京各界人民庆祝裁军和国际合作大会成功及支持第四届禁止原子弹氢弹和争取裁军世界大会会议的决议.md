The people of all circles in China's capital, Beijing, listened with satisfaction and excitement to the report by Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Stockholm Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference, on the conference's proceedings and achievements. We unanimously believe that the Stockholm Conference has made a significant contribution to the cause of opposing US-British imperialism's aggression and defending world peace, and we express our warm congratulations on the conference's success.

The Stockholm Conference solemnly condemned the armed aggression of US-British imperialism in Lebanon and Jordan, supported the just struggle of the Arab people to safeguard national independence, demanded that the US-British invading troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, demanded the immediate convening of a summit conference of great powers, demanded that the US and British governments immediately and unconditionally cease nuclear weapons testing, demanded that an international agreement be reached on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and called on the people of the world to take action quickly, actively, and resolutely to fight to stop US-British imperialism's aggression and safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world. The conference expressed the strong will and common desire of the people of all countries to oppose imperialism headed by the United States and to safeguard world peace, and once again demonstrated the unprecedented development and growth of the world's people's movement against colonialism and in defense of peace. The forces of peace have overwhelmed and will continue to overwhelm the forces of war.

The Chinese people fully support the resolutions and documents of the Stockholm Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference and are willing to join hands more closely with the people of the world to strive for the complete realization of all the resolutions of the conference with effective practical actions.

The Chinese people are concerned about the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament to be held in Tokyo on August 15. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and support all the efforts and struggles of the Japanese people and the people of all countries to oppose the US policy of promoting atomic war threats and to strive for peace, independence, and democracy. We firmly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, its collusion with the United States in implementing militarization in Japan, and its conspiracies and actions that endanger peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people cannot ignore the fact that after the Soviet Union announced its unilateral cessation of nuclear testing, the United States continued to conduct a series of unprecedentedly intense nuclear explosions in the Pacific region and intensified the large-scale transport of various atomic weapons into Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, our territory occupied by the United States. The Chinese people, together with the people of the world, strongly condemn the US imperialist criminal acts of armed aggression and endangering world peace and security, resolutely demand that the US aggressive troops immediately withdraw completely from Lebanon, Japan, South Korea, our territory of Taiwan, and all foreign territories, resolutely demand that the British aggressive troops immediately withdraw completely from Jordan, demand that the United States and Britain immediately cease nuclear weapons testing and reach an international agreement on disarmament as soon as possible, and demand that the United States abolish all military bases set up in foreign countries. We expect the delegates from all countries attending the conference to make effective contributions to the cause of peace and wish the conference new achievements.

The meeting unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed the communique of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, believing that it reflects the common aspirations of the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, and is a new and great encouragement to the current struggle of the people of the world against aggression and in defense of peace. As the communique pointed out, if the imperialist madmen dare to impose war on the people of the world, all peace-loving and free countries and people of the world will unite closely and completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors.

The Chinese people will further unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, build socialism with greater vigor, strengthen the unbreakable fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, resolutely support the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and unite with all peace-loving and just people in the world to contribute all our strength to the cause of opposing the aggressive forces of imperialism headed by the United States and defending world peace.

    中国首都——北京各界人民满意和兴奋地听取了出席斯德哥尔摩裁军和国际合作大会中国代表团郭沫若团长关于大会经过和成就的报告。我们一致认为斯德哥尔摩大会对反对美英帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的事业作出了重大的贡献，并且对大会的成功表示热烈的祝贺。
    斯德哥尔摩大会严正地谴责了美英帝国主义在黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略、支持阿拉伯人民维护民族独立的正义斗争，要求美英侵略军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，要求立即召开大国首脑会议，要求美英政府立即无条件停止核武器试验，要求就裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器问题达成国际协议，并号召全世界人民行动起来，迅速、积极、坚决地为制止美英帝国主义侵略、维护中东和世界和平而斗争。大会表达了当前各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的坚强意志和共同愿望，并再一次地证明世界人民反对殖民主义和保卫和平的运动的空前发展和壮大，和平力量已经压倒和将继续压倒战争势力。

    会议一致热烈拥护中苏两国领导人的会谈公报，认为它反映了中苏两国人民和一切爱好和平人民的共同愿望，对当前全世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的斗争是一个新的巨大的鼓舞。正如公报上所指出的，如果帝国主义狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，全世界所有爱好和平和自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者。
    中国人民将进一步团结在中国共产党领导下，更加鼓足干劲地建设社会主义，加强中苏牢不可破的兄弟友谊，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，并同全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人们团结起来，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力和保卫世界和平的事业贡献自己的一切力量。
