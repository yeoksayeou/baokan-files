　　Chinese Fitter's Cutting Tools Designed
　　Are Widely Used in Kharkov Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, August 19th, Kharkov dispatch via TASS: Workers at the Malyshev Factory in Kharkov, Ukraine, are widely using drill bits with a re-sharpened geometry designed by Chinese fitter Ni Zhifu when machining many parts of internal combustion engines. This type of drill bit can speed up drilling operations by one and a half times. In addition, one drill bit can now process five large parts, while the previous cutting tools could only process three such large parts. As a result, workers' labor productivity has been greatly increased, and a large number of tools have also been saved.
    The Kharkov Transport Machine-Building Plant has now designed and manufactured many specialized pieces of equipment in order to grind a large number of various diameter drill bits quickly and well according to Ni Zhifu's method.

　　我国钳工设计的切削工具
　　在哈尔科夫工厂被广泛应用
    新华社19日讯  据塔斯社哈尔科夫讯：乌克兰哈尔科夫马利歇夫工厂的工人在对内燃机许多零件进行机械加工的时候，广泛采用了中国钳工倪志福所设计的刃磨几何形钻头。这种钻头可以使处理钻孔的工作加快一倍半。此外，现在一个钻头可以对五个大零件进行加工，而过去的切削工具只能对三个这样大的零件进行加工。因此，工人的劳动生产率大大地提高了，同时也节约了大量的工具。
    哈尔科夫运输机器制造厂现在已经设计和制造了许多专门设备，以便又快又好地按照倪志福的方法来磨制大量的各种不同直径的钻头。
