　　Settled Nomadism, Prosperity for People and Livestock
　　Herdsmen of Huhe Nuoer Happily Enjoy New Life
    (Reported by this newspaper) How can nomadic peoples who have lived by moving with water and grass for many years achieve "prosperity for both people and livestock"? The Huhe Nuoer Livestock Production Cooperative in Chen Barag Banner, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, has adopted the method of "settled nomadism" and has successfully solved this problem.

    This cooperative is located on the south bank of Huhe Nuoer (Mongolian for: Blue Lake), not far from the Bin (Harbin) Zhou (Manzhouli) railway line, where the water and grass are lush, and transportation is convenient. However, in the past, because the herdsmen drove their livestock and carried their yurts, constantly roaming the boundless grasslands, they were often exposed to wind, frost, rain, and dew, and epidemics occurred frequently, which seriously affected the safety of both people and livestock. After the establishment of the livestock production cooperative in June 1954, the members responded to the call of the Party and the government and adopted a "settled nomadism" mode of production and life. On the one hand, the elderly, the weak, women, children, and heavy furniture were placed in the settled area for construction, and on the other hand, the young and strong male and female herdsmen continued to follow the "Aotere" (Mongolian for: grazing pasture). In this way, the contradiction of "suffering for people who wander without settling, and suffering for livestock who settle without wandering" was solved. Through settled nomadism, both people and livestock could enjoy well-being and achieve prosperity.

    When this cooperative was first established, it had only more than 2,400 head (pieces) of livestock. Through settled nomadism, improved feeding management, and improved livestock breeds, over the years, in addition to selling more than 2,000 head (pieces) of livestock to the state to support socialist construction, the number of livestock has now grown to more than 7,000 head (pieces), of which nearly 1,000 head (pieces) are first-generation improved breeds. The cooperative built permanent, spacious sheds in the settled area. The roofs of the warm sheds built for the old, weak, and young livestock were plastered with mud, and several windows were opened on the sunny walls of the sheds, so that the excrement and urine of the livestock could be quickly dried by the wind, and the livestock would not be affected by storms, rain, or snow, which played a significant role in the development, reproduction, and growth of the livestock.

    Due to the implementation of the "settled nomadism" life, the elderly, the weak, women, and children, especially pregnant women, no longer follow the herds, which promoted population growth. According to the statistics of this cooperative in the past three years, thirty-one women have given birth to twenty-nine children, of which more than 90% have adopted the new method of delivery. There are currently four women who are pregnant. Herdsman woman Se Enhuheng had been pregnant and given birth to nine children in the past. Due to frequent movement and the exposure to wind, snow, rain, and dew, three children were miscarried during pregnancy, and the remaining six children died due to the dampness of the ground in the yurt or contracting diseases such as venereal diseases and epidemics. After liberation, the two chubby babies newly born to Se Enhuheng in the settlement were very healthy. Recently, the cooperative is planning to build a nursery for the children in the settlement.

    With the realization of settled nomadism, the cultural life of the herdsmen has also become richer. Now, all school-age children in this cooperative have enrolled in school, of which seven have graduated from middle school. In addition, 85% of young and middle-aged people have overcome illiteracy. The cultural activities of this cooperative are also relatively active. The cooperative has radios, phonographs, slide projectors, and various cultural and entertainment tools such as the Huqin. The members often gather in the library to read Mongolian and Chinese books and newspapers, listen to Mongolian broadcasts and Mongolian songs, living a new life that is completely different from the past.

### 定居游牧　人畜两旺　呼和淖尔牧民欢度新生活

　　定居游牧　人畜两旺
　　呼和淖尔牧民欢度新生活
    本报讯　多年来逐水草而居的游牧民族如何达到“人畜两旺”？内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟陈巴尔虎旗呼和淖尔牧业生产合作社采取“定居游牧”方式，已很好地解决了这个问题。
    这个社位于滨（哈尔滨）洲
  （满洲里）线右侧不远的呼和淖尔
  （蒙语：兰色的湖）南岸，这里水草丰茂，交通方便。但由于过去牧民们赶着牲畜，带着蒙古包常年游牧在无边的草原上，经常受到风霜雨露的侵袭，疫病不断发生，因而严重地影响到人畜的安全。1954年6月牧业生产合作社建立后，社员们响应了党和政府的号召，采取了“定居游牧”的生产和生活方式，一方面把老弱妇孺和笨重的家具放在定居地，进行定居地的建设，一方面由年轻力壮的男女牧民继续走“敖特尔”（蒙语：牧场放牧）。这样，便解决了“游而不居人遭罪，居而不游牲畜遭罪”的矛盾，通过定居游牧使人畜享福，并且达到人畜两旺。
    这个社初建立时只有大小牲畜二千四百多头（只），经过定居游牧，改进饲养管理和改良牲畜品种，数年来除卖给国家牲畜二千多头（只）支援社会主义建设外，现在大小牲畜已经发展到七千多头
  （只），其中还有近千头（只）是第一代优良品种。这个社在定居地上搭盖了永久性的宽敞的棚圈，在为老弱幼畜搭盖的暖棚顶上抹了泥，棚圈的向阳的墙上还开了数面窗户，使牲畜拉下的屎尿能很快被风吹干，牲畜也不会受到暴风和雨、雪的侵袭，对牲畜的发育繁殖和发展起了重大作用。
    由于实行了“定居游牧”的生活，老弱妇孺，特别是孕妇不再跟着畜群游动，促进了人口兴旺。据这个社近三年统计：三十一个妇女已经生了二十九个小孩，其中90％以上采用了新法接生。目前正在妊娠的还有四个妇女。牧民妇女色恩虎横过去曾怀孕和生产过九个孩子，由于经常游动，加上风雪雨露的侵袭，有三个孩子就在怀孕中流产了，其余六个孩子，也因为蒙古包里地上潮湿，或者传染上性病、疫病等病症而死去。解放后，色恩虎横在定居地上新生的两个胖娃娃都很健壮。最近，这个社正在定居地上为孩子们筹建一座托儿所。
    随着定居游牧的实现，牧民们的文化生活也更加丰富起来了。现在，这个社的学龄儿童已全部入了学，其中由中学毕业的就有七个。此外，85％的青壮年已摆脱了文盲状态。这个社的文娱活动也比较活跃，社里有收音机、留声机、幻灯和胡琴等各种文化娱乐工具，社员们经常聚集在图书室阅读蒙汉文书报，收听蒙语广播和蒙古歌曲，过着和过去截然不同的新生活。（附图片）
