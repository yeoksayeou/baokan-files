　　Is it "Inherently Deficient"?

　　The Nanjing Chenguang Machine Factory, relying on its own strength and adopting the method of ants gnawing at bones, is manufacturing heavy machinery, planning to expand itself into a heavy machine factory within a year. This matter reflects their great ambition and good methods.

　　To engage in socialist construction, one must have the ambition and aspirations to build socialism. Nowadays, some people lack this ambition, fearing the dragon in front and the tiger behind, wavering and hesitant. Not only do they not dare to move forward with great strides themselves, but they also come up with various reasons: what "inherent deficiencies," what "poor conditions," what "need for careful consideration," and so on, using ropes to entangle the footsteps of others.

　　Can't those who are "inherently deficient" rouse themselves and move forward with great strides? Can't先天 the day after tomorrow change bad congenital conditions? We believe that "inherent deficiency" is not a decisive condition; the decisive conditions lie in nurture and hard work after birth, and in people's lofty aspirations and great ambitions. The industrial foundation of our entire country was inherently deficient, but its later development speed is advancing by leaps and bounds.

　　Those who advocate inherent deficiency should cease!

　　是“先天不足”吗？
    南京晨光机器厂用自己的力量采取蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，制造重型机械，打算在一年时间内把自己扩建为重型机器厂。这件事情，反映了他们的雄心很大，办法也很好。
    搞社会主义建设就得要有建设社会主义的雄心和志气。现在，有些人却缺乏这种志气，前怕龙，后怕虎，摇摇摆摆，畏首畏尾。他们不但自己不敢大踏步前进，并且拿出各种理由：什么“先天不足”呀，“条件很差”呀，“要慎重考虑”呀等等绳索来缠住别人的脚步。
    难道“先天不足”就不能振作起来大踏步前进吗？难道先天的条件不好，后天的条件就不能改变吗？我们认为先天不足不是决定性的条件，决定性的条件还在于后天的培植和努力，在于人们的壮志和雄心。我们整个国家的工业基础就是先天不足的，然而它的后天发展速度却在突飞猛进。
    先天不足论者可以休矣！
