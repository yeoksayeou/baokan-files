　　Old Woman He, a Martyr's Family Member in Xitou
    "Green grass, red flowers bloom,
    The team's canteen, everyone extols.
    Who makes the steamed buns, who grinds the flour?
    Old Woman He, a martyr's family member in Xitou!"
    These few lines of folk songs were composed for the children by Aunt Wang Shumin and Zhang Shuqin of the Baohézhuang Production Team Nursery in Fengtai District, Beijing, to praise Old Woman He, a martyr's family member. Old Woman He is fifty-six years old this year, with a full head of white hair. She is a "Five Guarantees" household in the commune. Although she is old, she never admits defeat in front of young people. She is busy all day long, feeding pigs, raising chickens, and growing vegetables.
    On the evening of "July 1st," the team established a collective canteen. Upon hearing this news, she handed over half a bag of her own white flour, one and a half jin of oil, and vegetables from two fen of her garden the next morning. She even ran to Captain Wang Hai's house in person and requested: "Captain, you used to 'take care of' me in every way. Now that the team has established a canteen, quickly give me a job – let me cook in the canteen!"
    The captain thought: "Old Woman He is so old and also a martyr's family member and a 'Five Guarantees' household, how can we let her work hard again?" So he said, "Old Woman, you have suffered and toiled for most of your life, you should rest."
    "Socialism, everyone has a share! If I stay idle all day, it's like stir-frying vegetables without oil and salt, it's just tasteless."
    "There are many people in the canteen, you are old, so..." The captain knew that Old Woman He had a stubborn streak, and before she could finish speaking, he said half-jokingly and half-seriously.
    Old Woman He's request was rejected, but she was not discouraged. On the third day, she pulled a "fait accompli": at daybreak, she put on the white cloth cap she had made overnight, tied on her apron, and went to the canteen to help make steamed buns and cut vegetables. One night, Uncle Zhao was on night shift grinding flour. When Old Woman He found out, she went to help. Uncle Zhao disagreed, but she refused to leave no matter what. In desperation, Uncle Zhao was about to go find the captain. Upon hearing this, Old Woman He said, "It's no use finding anyone, anyway, the country doesn't have a rule that only allows eating but not working!" Later, the captain tried to persuade her, but it didn't work. He had no choice but to move a door plank and a quilt to the mill for her to rest, and only agreed that she would work the night shift once every three days to settle the matter.
    On the morning of August 16th, Old Woman He saw the captain eating in the canteen, so she brought him vegetables while humming two lines with a smile:
    "The Great Leap Forward, the countryside runs canteens,
    Captain Wang, the more you eat, the more fragrant it becomes!"
    Captain Wang also responded with two lines:
    "In the new society, everything is new,
    Old Woman He, may your children and grandchildren fill the hall!"
    Their conversation amused everyone in the canteen.

　　西头烈属贺大妈
    “青草地，开红花，
    队里食堂人人夸。
    谁做馍馍谁磨面？
    西头烈属贺大妈！”
    这几句歌谣，是北京丰台区保合庄生产队托儿组王淑敏和张淑琴阿姨编给孩子们唱，用来歌颂烈属贺大妈的。贺大妈今年五十六岁，满头白发，是社里的五保户，她虽然上了年纪，但在年青人跟前从不服输。她一天到黑，喂猪、养鸡、种菜，忙个不停。
    “七一”晚上，队里成立集体食堂。她知道这个消息后，第二天一早，就把自己的半袋白面、一斤半油和两分园子的菜交了出来。她还亲自跑到队长王海家里，要求说：队长，过去你样样“包”我，如今队里成立了食堂，快给我个差使——到食堂做饭吧！
    队长想：大妈这么大年纪，又是烈属和五保户，怎能让她再受累？便说：“大妈，您受苦受累大半辈子，该歇着了。”
    “社会主义，人人有分嘛！我成天呆着，就像炒菜没放油盐一样，怪没滋味的。”
    “食堂人多，您老人家还是……”队长知道大妈有股蘑菇劲，没等她说完，便半开玩笑半认真地说。
    大妈的要求落空了，可是她不灰心。第三天，她来了个“先斩后奏”：天刚亮，她就戴上连夜赶做的白布罩帽，系上围裙，到食堂帮助做馍馍、切菜。一天晚上，赵大叔值夜班磨面。贺大妈知道后，就去帮忙。赵大叔不同意，但她无论如何也不走。没办法，赵大叔就要去找队长。贺大妈一听，就说：“找谁也不行，反正国家没有只准吃不准干活这条章程！”队长后来好说歹说不顶事，只好搬了块门板和被子到磨房给她休息，并答应她三天值一次夜班才了事。
    8月16日早晨，大妈看见队长在食堂吃饭，便一边给他送菜，一边笑眯眯地哼了两句：
    “大跃进，农村办食堂，
    王队长，越吃越香！”
    王队长也和了两句：
    “新社会，处处新气象，
    贺大妈，儿孙满堂！”
    他俩这么一说，把食堂的人都逗乐了。
