    The First New-Type Mine in the Hexi Corridor Goes into Production
    (Our dispatch) Gansu, The first new-type mine in the Hexi Corridor—the Shandan No. 1 Mine—was recently completed and put into production. The mine began development in September 1955. At that time, it was still a desolate and uninhabited valley. After hard work by the mine construction workers, it was handed over to production two months ahead of schedule. The designed annual output of this mine is 300,000 tons, and the annual output next year will strive to reach 450,000 tons.

    河西走廊第一对新型矿井投入生产
    本报讯  甘肃河西走廊第一对新型的矿井——山丹一号矿井已于最近建成并投入生产。这个矿井是在1955年9月开始开拓的。在那时，这里还是一片荒无人烟的山谷，经过了建井职工们的苦战，比原计划又提前二个月移交了生产。这个矿井的设计年产量为三十万吨，明年年产量争取要达四十五万吨。
