    Lightweight X-ray Machine
    A lightweight X-ray machine suitable for use in factories, mines, and rural areas has recently been successfully trial-produced in Tianjin. This is the result of the collaboration between Qin Yunfeng, an employee and technician at the electrotherapy room of the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Station. This "Red Flag" brand X-ray machine is very suitable for use in factories, mines, and rural areas. It weighs only one-sixth of a regular X-ray machine, is easy to move, and is simple to operate. It can be used for fluoroscopy and photography. Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Ming photographed.
