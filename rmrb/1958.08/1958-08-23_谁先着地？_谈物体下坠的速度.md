　　Who Lands First?
　　——Talking About the Speed of Falling Objects
　　Lin Bin
    The falling of objects from above is one of the earliest natural phenomena familiar to mankind.

    Stones thrown out, arrows shot, leaves blown by the wind, and dust raised all eventually return to the ground, as if an invisible hand is always grabbing them.

    The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle made the conclusion that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.

    By the Middle Ages, due to the development of artillery, there was an urgent need to study the laws of falling objects. At this time, scholastic philosophers were superstitious about Aristotle's conclusion and believed that the speed of a falling object was determined by its weight. Although they knew of the existence of air resistance, they did not consider the impact of air resistance on falling objects.

    Galileo was the first to propose a different view, believing that falling objects, regardless of their weight, should have the same speed. The different falling speeds observed in real life are only the result of air resistance.

    In order to oppose the superstition of the scholastic philosophers, Galileo cleverly demonstrated that Aristotle's conclusion contained insurmountable contradictions with an example: Suppose two lead balls, one large and one small, one heavy and one light. When they fall separately, according to Aristotle's conclusion, the speed of the large ball should be greater than that of the small ball. If the two balls are connected with a chain and fall together, what will be the result? From the situation when they fall separately, the following inference can be made: the speed of the small ball is slower than that of the large ball. Therefore, the result of the small ball acting on the large ball through the chain will make the falling speed of the entire system slower than that of the large ball falling alone. However, it can also be considered from another angle, treating the large and small balls connected by a chain as a whole. This whole is heavier than the large ball, and according to Aristotle's opinion, it should have a greater speed than the large ball.

    In this way, according to Aristotle's view, his conclusion is illogical.

    Galileo not only pointed out Aristotle's mistake logically, but also further conducted experiments on a leaning tower in Pisa, Italy, to prove that his view was correct.

    Now, to verify Galileo's conclusion, we don't need to go to Pisa. Just in an evacuated glass tube, we can see feathers and bullets falling at the same speed.

### 谁先着地？——谈物体下坠的速度

　　谁先着地？
　　——谈物体下坠的速度
　　林彬
    东西从上往下落，是人类最早熟悉的自然现象之一。
    抛出去的石块、射出去的箭、被风吹落的树叶、扬起的灰尘，终归要重新回到地面上，就好像有一只无形的手永远将他们抓住一样。
    古希腊哲人亚里斯多德作过这样一个结论：重的物体要比轻的物体下落得快些。
    到中世纪，由于炮术的发展，迫切要求研究物体下落的规律。这时，经院哲学家们迷信着亚里斯多德的结论，并认为：物体下落的速度，是由它的重量所决定的。虽然他们也知道空气阻力的存在，却不去考虑空气阻力对下落物体的影响。
    伽里略首先提出了不同的看法，他认为下落物体不论轻重，都应该具有相同的速度。实际生活中所观察到的下落速度不同，只不过是空气阻力的影响罢了。
    为了反对经院哲学家们的迷信，伽里略用一个例子巧妙地论证了亚里斯多德的结论中包含着不可克服的矛盾：试设想两铅球，一大一小，一重一轻，它们分别下落时，按照亚里斯多德的结论，大球的速度应比小球的大。若用链子将两球连起来，一起下落，将会有什么结果呢？由分别下落时的情况，可以作出这样的推论：小球的速度比大球慢。因而，小球通过链子对大球作用的结果，会使整个体系下落的速度比大球单独下落时要慢。但是，也可以从另一个角度出发，把用链子连起来的大小球看成一个整体，这个整体比大球重，按照亚里斯多德的意见，应有比大球还要大的速度。
    就这样，按照亚里斯多德的看法，它的结论是不合逻辑的。
    伽里略不仅从逻辑上指出了亚里斯多德的错误，还进一步在意大利比萨地方的一座斜塔上作了实验，证实自己的看法是正确的。
    现在，要证实伽里略的结论，我们用不着到比萨去。只消在一个抽空的玻璃管中，我们就可以看到羽毛和弹丸用同样的速度下落。
