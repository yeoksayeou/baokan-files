    A clap of thunder startles the world,
    The Sino-Soviet talks are in Beijing,
    Two giants shake hands firmly,
    To defend peace and oppose war!
    A beam of red light illuminates the sky,
    The communique of the talks spreads everywhere,
    Everyone says the talks are of great significance,
    The communique, each word weighs a ton!
    China and the Soviet Union stand shoulder to shoulder,
    Standing on the front line of peace,
    The people of the world unite closely,
    Our iron fist, its power is as great as the sky!
    China and the Soviet Union love peace,
    The people of the world all welcome this,
    If you ask who is unhappy?
    A small bunch of war profiteers!
    The communique warns the aggressors,
    Turn back to the shore and quickly withdraw your troops,
    Quickly get out of Jordan,
    Quickly get out of Lebanon!
    The communique of the talks is better than a missile,
    The imperialists are terrified,
    If you want to save your dog's life,
    Quickly put away your bad plans!

    一道红光照满天（花鼓）
    陈涛
    霹雳一声天下惊，
    中苏会谈在北京，
    两个巨人紧握手，
    保卫呀和平反战争。
    一道红光照满天，
    会谈公报到处传，
    都说会谈意义大，
    公报呀一字重如山。
    中苏两国肩并肩，
    站在和平最前线，
    世界人民团结紧，
    铁拳呀力量大如天！
    中苏两国爱和平，
    世界人民都欢迎，
    若问那个不高兴？
    战争呀贩子一小群！
    公报警告侵略者，
    回头是岸快收兵，
    赶快滚出约旦去，
    赶快呀滚出黎巴嫩！
    会谈公报胜导弹，
    帝国主义心胆战，
    若想把你狗命保，
    赶快呀收起坏算盘！
