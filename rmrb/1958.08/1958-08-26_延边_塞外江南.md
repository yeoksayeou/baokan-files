　　Yanbian - A Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall
　　Mao Dun
　　The train ride from Tumen Station to Yanji City (the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture) takes two hours. I haven't been home for four or five years, but the "Jiangnan scenery" seen from the train made me wonder if I was already in my hometown. Ah, how beautiful! Lush green paddy fields. How strong the oxen pulling the plows are! They are not like the water buffalo in my hometown, but they don't seem like the yellow cattle commonly seen in North and Northwest China either. In Yanbian, oxen are used more often than horses for plowing. The five counties of the Autonomous Prefecture, with 200,000 hectares of cultivated land, have about 130,000 head of cattle (planned to increase to 160,000 head in 1962), while horses number only 15,000.
　　The two-hour train ride, over mountains and ridges, reveals paddy fields in the flatlands between the mountains. Yanbian currently has 200,000 hectares of cultivated land, of which 50,000 hectares are paddy fields. In other words, all the flatlands that can be converted into paddy fields have already been converted; the future task is to draw water up the mountains and open up terraced fields. This is the second of Yanbian's four agricultural modernizations: water conservancy and terracing. The other two are mechanization and electrification. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and illuminated by the brilliant General Line, the people of Yanbian are ambitiously planning to basically complete the four modernizations by 1962. By then, the total area of paddy fields will be 144,000 hectares, accounting for 70% of the prefecture's total cultivated land area, and grain (mainly rice) production will be 533,000 tons. This year's plan is 340,000 tons, while the region's food needs are 270,000 tons, leaving a surplus.
　　But the mountain slopes are not idle now. Everywhere you look there is flax, yellow tobacco, and peas with small white flowers blooming. Every few yards, there are fruit trees, most of which are the famous apple pears.
　　The distant high mountains are forests, accounting for more than 82% of the prefecture's area. The forests contain valuable medicinal materials. First and foremost is ginseng, as well as astragalus and fritillaria. The plan for 1962 is to cultivate 689,342 square meters of ginseng and 3,000 hectares of other medicinal materials. The forests also contain valuable fur-bearing animals, the most famous of which is the sable, which is also planned for breeding to expand its propagation. Deer farming has already begun. This is a type of agricultural sideline. Other agricultural sidelines include beekeeping, fish farming, and tussah silkworm rearing. For tussah silkworms alone, the plan for 1962 is to rear 10,000 "ba" (tussah silkworms are calculated in "ba," where "ba" refers to the amount of work that can be done by one person with a pair of scissors in one day, yielding approximately 20,000 cocoons per "ba"). There is also frog farming. For a long time, these special frogs have been famous throughout the country, and frog oil (i.e., the frog's endocrine gland, which comes in block form) is a valuable tonic.
　　The resources of the mountainous areas are extraordinarily rich. The geological data currently known are quite incomplete, but it can be asserted that gold and black gold (coal) are found almost everywhere. All five counties in Yanbian produce coal, and the quality is very good. Oil shale is also found almost everywhere, with an oil content of 13.5%. If you take a small piece and light it with a match, it will burn like a candle. The newly built oil refinery will produce 50,000 tons this year and 100,000 tons next year. In addition, molybdenum, antimony, lead, zinc, mica, and crystal have all been discovered, but it is not yet clear how much is contained. A newly discovered large copper mine, based on known reserves, ranks among the best in the country in terms of reserves, and the quality is also very good.
　　Such abundant resources were previously discarded. Yanbian's industry began to be established after liberation. As the car approaches Yanji City, you can see many tall chimneys spewing thick smoke on the south side of the Yanji River. This is the achievement of the First Five-Year Plan. Cement, fertilizer, papermaking, knitting, agricultural tool manufacturing, rubber, oil refining, and other factories will all accelerate Yanbian's industrialization with leaps and bounds in the future. It is planned that next year, the output value of local industrial products can exceed agriculture. After the Great Leap Forward, seven state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines have created 308 new records, three of which are breakthroughs in international standards. This marks the beginning of a high tide of technological revolution in Yanbian.
　　In the autumn of 1956, Yanbian had already universalized primary education. 82% of the region's young and middle-aged people have been freed from illiteracy. During the First Five-Year Plan, a total of 32,223 junior high school graduates, 7,117 senior high school graduates, and 1,015 secondary technical school graduates. Yanbian University graduated 1,099 students in these five years. Comparing these figures with the total population of the region (over 800,000) shows that Yanbian has a very high level of education. The large number of junior high school graduates in rural areas is a favorable condition for Yanbian's agricultural development.
　　Dongsheng Township (30 miles from Yanji City, just over Mao'er Mountain) has a famous Liming (Kim Si-ryong) Advanced Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative officially announced the establishment of a private agricultural university this May Day. This amateur agricultural university is the first of its kind in the country. There are currently 51 students (9 of whom are female), all of whom are young farmers and township cadres with high school education and three to eight years of labor or grassroots work experience. The first batch of admitted students all passed the examination (politics, physics, chemistry, basic knowledge of Darwinism), and the courses they are now studying are all based on the local, current, and future development needs of production, with a total of 11 courses. Students have two and a half days of classes each week, and two hours of review and discussion every evening, thus fully realizing the principle of combining learning with labor and theory with practice.
　　Dongsheng Township universalized primary school education in July 1956 and universalized secondary education this year; only four semi-literate people among the township's 3,000+ young people, and 60% of the young farmers have a junior high school education or above. During the Great Leap Forward, the township saw a surge in the enthusiasm for private education, with seven newly built junior and senior high schools, 36 amateur elementary schools, 15 amateur junior high schools, and 12 amateur senior high schools. Comparing these figures with the township's population (more than 3,300 households; I forgot the exact population figure, but assuming five people per household, it would be more than 16,500 people) gives an idea of the extent of education popularization. The amateur agricultural university currently has only 51 students, but 300-400 people have already applied to take the second batch of examinations.
　　The Kim Si-ryong Cooperative is the largest of the eight cooperatives in Dongsheng Township. It owns one-third of the township's cultivated land and more than half of the population. Therefore, the situation has now emerged that it is necessary to merge again (merge the remaining seven small cooperatives with the Kim Cooperative) so that the allocation of manpower and funds is conducive to production development. It is said that this matter will be realized soon. At that time, this earliest established advanced cooperative named "Liming" (Kim Si-ryong is a model worker, a representative of the National People's Congress, the founder and current president of the Liming Cooperative) will probably be the first in the country again; imagine, with more than 9,000 hectares of land, a population of 15,000 to 16,000, so many schools, almost no illiteracy, and 60% of young people with a junior high school education or above, isn't that outstanding? Isn't it the first in the country?
　　Because I didn't have enough time, I only took a cursory look at the Liming Cooperative, but it left me with a very deep impression. Look, the iron factory is leaping forward for new agricultural tools and for technological revolution, the brick and tile factory is preparing materials for rebuilding the homes of cooperative members, and the health center and maternal and child health station are so clean and fully equipped. The book section of the supply and marketing cooperative has more than 400 kinds of books. In addition, there are eight mass reading rooms and 74 field reading groups. Cooperative members subscribe to four or five kinds of daily newspapers, more than 300 copies, and the "Red Flag" magazine alone has 70 subscriptions (the third quarter subscriptions for "Red Flag" increased to 61 copies in Korean and 27 copies in Chinese), with over 500 subscriptions to other publications. Cooperative members told me: Before liberation, under the occupation of Japanese imperialism, they were deprived of the right to even learn their own national language and writing. Now they run their own schools and amateur universities. This is truly a world of difference. These are all vivid achievements of the Party's ethnic policy!
　　The cooperative's literary and artistic activities can be seen from the following figures. The cooperative has eight clubs (one for each production team), one central club, and 450 amateur actors. The clubs are divided into four groups: creation, performance, sports, and publicity. Last winter and this spring, during the tense water conservancy construction, more than a thousand people worked in the field every night, and the literary and artistic team performed at the construction site every night. When I visited this cooperative, I saw that its "gallery newspaper" was very wonderful. "Gallery newspaper" is very common in Yanbian's rural areas, and every cooperative has one. This is a large propaganda painting pasted on the wall, in color, with more than a dozen pictures together, so it is called "gallery"; these paintings are changed frequently to cooperate with the central task, so it is a "newspaper." One of the big pictures in the Liming Cooperative's gallery newspaper is entitled "Making High Mountains Bow and Rivers Give Way." A giant is pressing down on one mountain top with one hand and pushing another mountain top away with the other. The river rolls between the two mountains, vividly and powerfully drawn. Among the peasant amateur painters, there are many geniuses.　〔To be continued〕

　　延边——塞外江南
　　茅盾
    从图门站到延吉市（延边朝鲜族自治州的首府），车行二小时。我有四、五年不回家乡了，可是车行所见的“江南风光”，使我错疑已在故乡。啊，多么美丽呀！绿油油的水田。拉犁的牛多么壮健！它们不像我们家乡的水牛，可是和华北、西北惯见的黄牛，好像也不一样。延边耕田少用马，多用牛。自治州五个县，二十万垧耕地共有牛约十三万头（1962年计划增加到十六万头），而马呢，不过一万五千匹。
    车行两小时，翻山越岭，但见两山之间的平地都是水田。延边现在有耕地二十万垧，其中水田是五万垧，也就是说，凡是可以改为水田的平川之地都已经改为水田了；以后的问题是引水上山，开辟梯田，这是延边农业四化计划中的二化：水利化，梯田化。其余二化是机械化和电气化。在共产党领导之下，总路线光明照耀之下，延边人民雄心勃勃地要在1962年基本上完成四化。到那时候，水田总数将为十四万四千垧，占全州耕地总面积70％，粮食（主要是大米）的产量将为五十三万三千吨。今年计划是三十四万吨，全区民食需用二十七万吨，那就有余了。
    但是现在山坡上并不空闲，到处都是亚麻、黄烟和正开着小白花的豌豆。相隔几丈，有果木树，其中大部分是著名的苹果梨。
    远处高山是森林，占全州面积82％强。森林里有宝贵的药材。首先是人参，还有黄耆、贝母。计划到1962年，要种植人参六十八万九千三百四十二平方公尺，其他药材三千垧。森林里还有珍贵皮毛的兽类，最著名的是貂，也在计划饲养，以广繁殖。养鹿已经开始了。这是农副业之一种。此外的农副业还有养蜂、养鱼、放养柞蚕。光是柞蚕，计划到1962年要放养一万把（柞蚕以“把”为计算单位，“把”者一把剪子一人一天所可能做到的工作量，每把约得茧二万余）。还有，养蛤蟆，长久以来，这特种的蛤蟆驰名全国，蛤蟆油（即蛤蟆的内分泌腺，作块状）是珍贵的补品。
    山区的资源是异常丰富的。现在已知的地质材料颇不完全，然而，可以断言，黄金和乌金（煤）几乎到处都有。延边五个县都产煤，而且质量很好。油母页岩也几乎到处都有，含油量13.5％，取一小片用火柴引火，就会像蜡烛一样点燃起来。新办的炼油厂，今年生产五万吨，明年十万吨。此外，钼、锑、铅、锌、云母、水晶，都有发现，可还没探明白蕴藏有多少。新探得的一个大铜矿，据已知的蕴藏量，在国内是名列前茅，而且质量很好。
    这样丰富的资源，从前是货弃于地。延边的工业是在解放以后开始建立的。车子驶近延吉市，你就看见延吉江的南面，吐着浓烟的许多高烟囱。这是第一个五年计划的成就。水泥、肥料、造纸、针织、农具制造、橡胶、炼油等等工厂，今后都将以飞跃的发展来加速延边的工业化，计划在明年，地方工业品产值可以超过农业。大跃进后，七个国营和地方国营厂矿已经创造三百零八件新纪录，其中三件是突破国际水平的。这标志了技术革命的浪潮在延边已经开始高涨了。
    1956年秋季，延边已经普及了初等教育。全区82％的青壮年已经脱离文盲状态。第一个五年计划期间，初中毕业生共三万二千二百二十三名，高中毕业生七千一百十七名，中等技术学校毕业生一千零十五名。延边大学在这五年内的毕业生是一千零九十九名。把这几项的数目字和全区的人口（八十万多）总数一比较，就显出延边的文化水平是很高的。农村中的初中毕业生人数之多，是延边农业发展的有利条件。
    东盛乡（离延吉市三十里，翻过帽儿山就到了），有一个著名的黎明（金时龙）高级农业合作社，就是这个社在今年五一宣布了民办农业大学的正式成立。这个业余的农业大学是全国同类的民办大学的第一所。现有学生五十一人（其中女生九人），都是具有高中文化程度、经过三年至八年的劳动锻炼或基层工作锻炼的青年农民和乡干部。这第一批入学的学生都经过考试（政治、物理、化学、达尔文主义基础知识），他们现在所学的功课都是根据当地当时和未来发展的生产需要而订立的，共十一门。学生们每星期有两个半天上课，每天晚间两个小时的复习和讨论，因此，完全实现了学习和劳动、理论和实践相结合的原则。
    东盛乡在1956年7月就普及了小学教育，今年又普及了中等教育；全乡三千多青年中只有四名半文盲，60％的青年农民有初中以上文化程度。大跃进中，全乡涌起了民办教育的干劲，新建的初中、高中七所，业余高小三十六所，业余初中十五所，业余高中十二所。把这些数目字和全乡人口（三千三百多户，人口的数字我忘记了，假定五口一户就是一万六千五百多口，）一比较，就可以想见教育普及的情况。业余的农业大学现在只有五十一名学生，可是报名投考第二批的，已经有三、四百人。
    金时龙合作社是东盛乡八个合作社中最大的一个，它拥有全乡耕地的三分之一，人口的一半多，因此，现在已经出现了必须再合并（把其余的七个小社和金社合并）然后在人力和资金等调配方面有利于生产发展的形势。据说这件事不久就可实现。那时候，这个最早成立、命名为“黎明”的高级合作社，（金时龙是劳模，全国人大代表，黎明社的创办人，现社长，）大概在全国又将考上第一；你想，土地九千多垧，人口一万五、六千，有那样多的学校，几乎没有文盲，青年的60％有初中以上文化水平，这不突出么？还不是全国第一么？
    我因为时间不够，只在黎明社走马看花而已，可是，给我的印象是非常深刻的。你看，铁工厂正为新式农具、为技术革命而跃进，砖瓦厂正为改建社员的住宅而准备材料，卫生所、妇幼保健站多么整洁而且设备完全，供销合作社的书刊部分有四百多种的书籍。此外，还有群众图书室八个，田间读报组七十四个，社员订阅日报四、五种，三百多份，光是“红旗”，就订阅七十份（第三季度订阅“红旗”的，朝文版增至六十一份，汉文版增至二十七份），订阅其他刊物共五百多份。社员对我说：解放前，在日本帝国主义占领下，他们连学习自己的民族语言文字的权利都被剥夺，现在他们自己办学校，办业余大学，这真是天壤之别。这都是党的民族政策的活生生的成绩！
    这个社的文艺活动，单看下面的数字，也可以想见它的活跃。全社有八个俱乐部（每个生产队一个），一个中心俱乐部，业余演员四百五十人。俱乐部分四组：创作，表演，体育，宣传。去冬今春，水利建设紧张时，每晚都有千多人在野外工作，文艺队也是每晚在工地表演。我在参观这个社的时候；看出它的“画廊报”十分精采。“画廊报”在延边农村很普遍，每个合作社都有。这是贴在壁上的大幅宣传画，彩色，十几幅在一起，所以称为“画廊”；这些画经常更换，配合中心任务，所以是“报”。黎明社的画廊报中有一幅大画，标题是“叫高山低头，令河水让路”，一个巨人一手按住一个山头，另一手托开一个山头，两山之间河水滚滚而过，画得生动有力。农民的业余画家中，有不少天才。　〔本节未完待续〕
