　　Datian Becomes the First Red Banner for Promoting Putonghua in Fujian
　　(Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Lei Pu reports: Datian County, Fujian Province, has implemented the mass line in the cultural revolution. In just four months, Putonghua has been popularized among more than 80% of young and middle-aged people and some elderly people in the county, making it the first red banner for promoting Putonghua in Fujian Province.
　　Datian County is the most remote mountainous area in Fujian. Transportation is inconvenient, and there are many dialects in the county, including Southern Min dialect, Yong'an dialect, and Datian dialect, which is mainly used in the urban area. Some neighboring villages and communities are only separated by a mountain or a river. Because of language differences, they cannot communicate with each other, and even have many difficulties in asking for directions, visiting relatives and friends, and buying and selling. When the county and district hold various meetings and exchange work experiences in various townships, there are also various inconveniences due to language barriers. Since the Great Leap Forward, all undertakings have required more cooperation from all parties, and the masses have more deeply felt the pain of not understanding Putonghua, and universally demanded to learn Putonghua at the same time as the upsurge of cultural learning.
　　According to the needs of the masses, the Datian County Party Committee resolutely broke all old ideas, established a new ideological style, and launched the work of promoting Putonghua throughout the county. In the past, relevant departments believed that Fujian dialects were complicated, and learning Putonghua could only be tested in key areas and could not be popularized quickly. Therefore, they entangled the work in dialect investigation, mastering corresponding rules, etc., and only focused on promoting Putonghua in schools and cities. The Datian County Party Committee first criticized this bookworm view and right-leaning conservative ideology, and boldly shifted the focus of popularization to the vast number of peasant masses who have the largest population, the lowest cultural foundation, the most difficult to learn Putonghua, but also the most urgent need to learn; and did not seek advice from a lot of dialect investigation materials, nor did they drill linguistic theories to death, but adopted the method of relying closely on the masses, and launched a mass movement to popularize Putonghua throughout the county.
　　In just four months, Datian County created the miracle of basically popularizing Putonghua among the young and middle-aged people in the county and gained rich experience. These experiences are: First, popularizing Putonghua is combined with eliminating illiteracy, and all private schools and night schools in the county use Putonghua for teaching. Second, carry out mass mutual teaching and mutual learning movements, mobilize Party members and League members to take the lead in learning, speaking, and teaching; students go home to teach family members by contract; relatives teach relatives, neighbors teach neighbors, husbands and wives teach each other, and children teach their parents. Second, dissolve the teaching of Putonghua into the daily production and life of the masses, and speak Putonghua everywhere, and talk about whatever you encounter. For example, learning Putonghua groups are organized in production teams, shepherds, and women, learning while working. Fourth, dispel the ideological concerns of the elderly and women, and mobilize them to learn Putonghua. Datian County also took timely comparative and grievance-telling education methods to enlighten the masses to tell the suffering of not understanding Putonghua, compare the benefits of speaking Putonghua, and constantly strengthen the masses' confidence in learning Putonghua.
　　After promoting Putonghua, it has brought great benefits to the masses in politics, ideology, and production. The masses said: Learning Putonghua really gets "one see," "two changes," and "three benefits." "One see" is to see the prospects of socialist construction; "two changes" are that the dumb become able to speak, and the deaf become able to hear; "three benefits" are that they can understand reports, political awareness is improved, exchanging production experience is good, and daily life is convenient. At present, Putonghua has become a common language for the general public in Datian County. Whether at home, going up the mountain, going down to the field, entering a store, performing in a play, visiting relatives and friends, or asking for directions, Putonghua is used everywhere. When entering a store to buy something, you must first speak Putonghua before paying for the goods. If you do not speak well or forget, the salesperson will teach you on the spot. When people from other townships ask for directions in dialect, the masses say: "We speak Putonghua here," and teach the passers-by on the spot. Working in the fields, talking and laughing are also done in Putonghua. The masses reflect: "Ears listen, mouth speaks, hands are strong, legs are strong, and labor does not feel long." These new trends are described in a song: "Language connects all directions, talk everywhere, sing everywhere, visit relatives everywhere." (Attached picture)

### 有话到处讲　有歌到处唱　有亲到处访　人人都欢畅  学会普通话　语言通八方  大田成为福建推广普通话第一面红旗

　　有话到处讲　有歌到处唱　有亲到处访　人人都欢畅
    学会普通话　语言通八方
    大田成为福建推广普通话第一面红旗
    本报讯　记者雷普报道：福建省大田县在文化革命中贯彻群众路线，只用四个月时间，在全县80％以上的青壮年和一部分老年人中普及了普通话，成为福建省推广普通话的第一面红旗。
    大田县是福建最偏僻的山区，交通不便，全县有闽南话、永安话和以城关为主的大田话等多种方言。有些邻乡邻社，只有一山一河之隔，因为语言差异，彼此感情无法沟通，甚至寻路问津、探亲访友、买卖交换都有很多困难。县、区召开各种会议和各乡交流工作经验时，也因为语言不通发生种种不便。大跃进以来，各项事业更需要各方面的共同协作，广大群众就更深刻地感到不懂普通话的苦处，普遍要求在文化学习高潮中同时学习普通话。
    根据群众的需要，中共大田县委坚决破除一切陈旧观念，树立新的思想风格，在全县开展了推广普通话的工作。过去，有关部门认为福建方言复杂，学普通话只能重点试验，不能很快普及，因而把工作纠缠于方言调查、掌握对应规律等等方面，并且只把推广普通话的重点放在学校和城市。大田县委首先批判了这种书呆子观点和右倾保守思想，大胆地把普及重点移到人口最多、文化基础最低、学习普通话最困难但也要求最迫切的广大农民群众中去；并且也没有去求教于一大堆方言调查材料，也没有死钻语言学理论，而是采用紧紧依靠群众的办法，就在全县搞起普及普通话的运动来。
    只经过四个月，大田县就创造了在全县青壮年中基本上普及普通话的奇迹，并取得了丰富的经验。这些经验是：第一，普及普通话和扫盲结合，全县所有的民校、夜校一律采用普通话教学。第二，开展群众性的互教互学运动，发动党团员带头学、带头讲、带头教；学生回家分片包干教家人；亲教亲、邻教邻、夫妻互教、子女教双亲。第二，把教普通话溶化在群众日常生产、生活中去，到处都讲普通话，碰到什么讲什么。如在生产小组、牧童、妇女中都组织起学习普通话小组，一面劳动，一面学习。第四，解除老人、妇女的思想顾虑，发动他们学普通话。大田县还及时采取对比、诉苦的教育方法，启发群众诉不懂普通话的苦处，对比讲普通话的好处，不断地坚定群众学普通话的信心。
    推广普通话以后，不论在政治上、思想上、生产上都给群众带来了莫大的好处。群众说：学会普通话真正得到“一看”、“二变”、“三好处”。一看是看到社会主义建设前途；“二变”是哑巴变得会说话，聋子变得会听话；“三好处”是可以听懂报告，政治觉悟提高好，交流生产经验好，日常生活方便好。目前，在大田全县普通话已经成为一般群众的家常用语，不论在家、上山、下田、进店、演戏、探亲访友、寻路问津，处处都用普通话。进店买东西，先讲好普通话才付钱售货，讲不好或者忘记了，当场由营业员教会。外乡人用方言问路，群众说：“我们这里是讲普通话”，也当场教给过路人。下田劳动、谈天取笑也都用普通话。群众反映：“耳朵听，嘴巴讲，手有劲，腿有力，劳动不觉时间长”。这些新的风气，用一首歌来形容是：“语言通八方，有话到处讲，有歌到处唱，有亲到处访。”（附图片）
