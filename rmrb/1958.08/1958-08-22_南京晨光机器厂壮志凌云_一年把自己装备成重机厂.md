　　Nanjing Chenguang Machinery Factory Soars with Ambition
    Equipping Itself as a Heavy Machinery Plant in One Year
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, August 21st, reporter Jiang Qingping) The workers and worker-turned-technicians of the state-owned Nanjing Chenguang Machinery Factory, guided by the spirit of "indigenous methods creating foreign technology, small scale leading to large scale," are designing, sourcing materials, and manufacturing heavy machinery themselves. They strive to expand the factory into a large-scale heavy machinery plant with an annual output of rolling mills and various types of machine tools totaling 30,000 tons at the highest speed.
    The Chenguang Machinery Factory is a relatively large machinery factory, but it lacks heavy machinery equipment and lifting equipment. If it were to rely on the state for equipment and follow the "regular" path to expand into a heavy machinery plant, it would take at least three years. The factory's Party committee decided to use the method of prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign ones, manufacturing heavy machinery themselves to basically complete the expansion task within one year. Whether this decision could be realized prompted two distinctly different viewpoints from engineering and technical personnel with intellectual backgrounds and workers and worker-turned-technicians. Engineering and technical personnel with intellectual backgrounds believed that the factory's conditions were poor, the production tasks were heavy, and there were inherent deficiencies, so careful consideration was needed. Some said that the machinery factory was small, materials were lacking, how could large machines be manufactured? If indigenous methods can produce large machinery, why is steel needed? Some believed that the precision of machines manufactured with indigenous methods would not meet the requirements and would only be for show. Therefore, they adopted a skeptical, wait-and-see, passively discouraging attitude towards the policy of prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign ones. They issued a list of requirements, waiting for the state to supply heavy machinery. It seemed that without ready-made equipment, it was simply impossible to move forward. The attitude of the workers and worker-turned-technicians was exactly the opposite. They believed that reaching out to the state for machines was "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst" and was also a manifestation of dependence. They said: If the state had so many heavy machines, it wouldn't need us to produce them. Many veteran workers firmly believed that small machines and lack of materials should not be reasons. As long as you dare to think and dare to do, you can definitely build large machines.
    The Party committee promptly supported the workers' revolutionary drive. With the support of the Party committee and the efforts of the workers, the tool section manufactured a large vertical lathe weighing 20 tons, 10 meters long, 6 meters wide, covering an area of 60 square meters, and capable of processing workpieces with a diameter of 4 meters and a center height of 1.5 meters in just thirteen days. They only received two hundred screws, and everything else was made from waste materials. Without large castings, they used cement to make beams, bases, and turntables to replace castings.
    In the past month, they have also manufactured many large machines such as a 20-ton vertical boring machine, a 4-meter vertical planer, and a 15-ton crane.

### 南京晨光机器厂壮志凌云  一年把自己装备成重机厂

　　南京晨光机器厂壮志凌云
    一年把自己装备成重机厂
    本报南京21日电  记者蒋青萍报道：国营南京晨光机器厂的工人和工人出身的技术人员根据土中出洋、小中出大的精神，自己设计，自己找材料，自己制造重型机械。争取以最高速度将工厂扩建成一座年产轧钢机和各种型号总重量三万吨的大型机床的重型机械厂。
    晨光机器厂是一座较大的机械工厂，但厂内缺乏重型机械设备和起重设备，如果要依靠国家装备，走“正规化”的道路，扩建成重型机器厂，至少需要三年功夫。工厂党委便决定用先土后洋的办法，自己制造重型机械，在一年内基本完成扩建任务。这一决定能否实现，知识分子出身的工程技术人员和工人、工人出身的技术人员，存在着两种显然不同的看法。知识分子出身的工程技术人员认为工厂的条件差，生产任务繁重，先天不足，要慎重考虑。有的说机器厂小，材料缺，怎么能制造大机器。土办法能造大型机械，何必还要钢铁。有的认为土办法制造的机器精密度达不到要求，只能摆摆样子。因此，他们对先土后洋的方针，采取怀疑、观望的消极促退态度。他们开出了一批清单，坐等国家供给重型机械。似乎没有现成的装备，简直寸步难行。而工人和工人出身的技术人员的态度恰恰和他们相反。他们认为伸手向国家要机器是“远水救不了近火”，也是一种依赖思想。他们说：如果国家有这么多重型机械，就不要我们生产了。许多老工人很坚定地认为机器小、材料缺不能成为理由，只要敢想敢做就一定能造出大机器来。
    党委及时支持工人的革命干劲。在党委支持和工人们努力下，工具科制一台重二十吨、长十公尺、宽六公尺，占地面积六十平方公尺，可以加工直径四公尺中心高一点五公尺工作物的大落地车床只花了十三天功夫就制造成功了。他们只领了两百多个螺丝，其他全部是利用废旧材料。没有大型铸件，他们用水泥浇成横梁、底座、转盘等代替铸件。
    最近一个月来，他们还制出了二十吨的落地搪床、四公尺立式平床和十五吨行车等许多大型机械。
