Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 28th: Hong Kong and Macao newspapers on the 27th strongly condemned the Hong Kong British authorities' barbaric acts of forcibly closing the Chung Wah Middle School, and beating teachers, students, and Chinese journalists who were covering the event.

The "Wen Wei Po" published an editorial stating: "We want to remind the Hong Kong British authorities that the patriotic cause of Hong Kong compatriots, supported by 600 million people of a strong China, cannot be destroyed. The Chinese people who have stood up cannot be suppressed or intimidated by any violence. Hong Kong Chinese compatriots will fight to the end to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. All persecution of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots will only arouse the anger of the Chinese people and make Hong Kong compatriots even more united."

The "Ta Kung Pao" editorial said: The Hong Kong British authorities cannot conceal their true purpose of being hostile to the patriotic cause of the Chinese people, nor can they escape the responsibility they should bear! The Hong Kong British authorities should know that China is strong and the Chinese people are not to be taken lightly.

The "New Evening News" commentary warned the Hong Kong British authorities: Batons and clubs cannot intimidate people. The commentary stated that the Hong Kong British authorities arbitrarily interfered with freedom of the press and infringed upon human rights. The fact that they used a large number of armed police to deal with cultural and educational undertakings only shows how afraid they are of reasoning!

The "Macao Daily News" said: The actions of the Hong Kong British authorities this time fully exposed their imperialist ugly face. We solemnly warn the Hong Kong British authorities: The Chinese people who have stood up will not bow their heads. The Chinese people are the masters of Hong Kong, they have the right to run patriotic educational undertakings, and they have the right to conduct news interviews, and no rough interference is allowed.

　　警棍是吓不倒人的
    港澳报纸强烈谴责英国当局的野蛮行为
    新华社香港28日电　香港和澳门的报纸舆论27日强烈谴责香港英国当局强行封闭中华中学校舍，殴打教师学生和在场采访的中国新闻记者的横蛮暴行。
    “文汇报”发表社论说：“我们要提醒香港英国当局，有强大中国六亿人民支持的香港同胞的爱国事业是摧残不了的，站起来了的中国人民是任何暴力所镇压不倒、威吓不倒的。香港中国同胞将为维护自身的正当权益而斗争到底。一切对香港中国同胞的迫害，只有引起中国人民的愤怒，并使香港同胞更为团结”。
    “大公报”的社论说：香港英国当局不能掩蔽其敌视中国人民爱国事业的真正目的，也不能逃避其应负的责任！香港英国当局应该知道：中国是强大的，中国人民也是不容轻侮的。
    “新晚报”的评论正告香港英国当局：警棍乱棒是吓不倒人的。评论说，香港英国当局肆意干涉新闻自由和侵犯人权，对待文化教育事业竟然动用大批武装警察，这只说明了他们多么怯于讲理！
    “澳门日报”说：香港英国当局这次做法充分暴露了他们的帝国主义恶相。我们正告香港英国当局：站起来的中国人民是不会低头的。中国人才是香港的主人，他们有权办爱国教育事业，有权进行新闻采访，决不容许粗暴的干涉。
