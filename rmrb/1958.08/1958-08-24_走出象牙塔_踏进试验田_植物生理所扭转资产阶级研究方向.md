Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 23rd:
　　As high-yield "satellites" take to the skies one after another on the agricultural production front, and the achievements in high yield become more and more astonishing, this pressing new situation has triggered a major debate within the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences regarding the two roads of scientific research: Should they, under the leadership of bourgeois experts, continue to hide in the ivory tower, self-appreciatingly conducting "theoretical research" that lags far behind production practice? Or should they, under the leadership of the Party, delve into the countryside, learn from and summarize the peasants' high-yield experiences, combine experts with the masses, and establish a new plant physiology that can guide production practice? After a sharp struggle, the scientific workers of this institute finally found the correct direction.

　　During the Two-Anti Movement, all members of the Institute of Plant Physiology had already launched a debate on the issue of integrating theory with practice. At the request of the majority, the leaders of the institute and some researchers also verbally agreed to organize work teams to participate in experimental fields, but in their minds, there was great resistance. At that time, only six scientific workers were sent to the countryside, and the purpose of going down was not clear enough. The institute also arranged other tasks for them. Since May and June, new agricultural high-yield records have constantly appeared on the institute's wall newspapers, and all researchers have visited the rural areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The peasants' soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom have made many young researchers and some enlightened scientists deeply feel that they are too backward. They have successively requested to go deep into the countryside, take peasants as teachers, summarize high-yield experiences, and study the physiological laws of plants in order to achieve large-scale high yields. However, the conservatives in the institute, posing as authoritative senior experts, believed that increasing agricultural production was the business of the agricultural sector, and that the research of plant physiology could and should not directly solve agricultural problems. The responsibility of plant physiologists was to explain the plant physiological laws of nature. As for transforming the natural world, it was not their business; otherwise, it would be reducing plant physiology to the "status" of agricultural science. They believed that plant physiology, as a theoretical discipline, its research methods were mainly to conduct artificially controlled single-factor experiments in the laboratory to derive certain laws of plant growth and development. As for the comprehensive agricultural practice in the field, it was extensive, inaccurate, and unscientific. Therefore, engaging in experimental fields was only vulgarizing science and burying plant physiology. However, even the conservatives could not overturn the facts of agricultural high-yield, so they created a strange theory saying that the peasants' creations were only "human sea tactics" of paying a large amount of labor, not science, and not worthy of attention. The conservatives not only did not want to delve into the countryside to summarize high-yield experiences themselves but also adopted a attitude of attacking and obstructing those who actively demanded to do so, satirizing them as ignorant, opportunistic, falsely active, and bandwagoning. When transferring personnel to participate in experimental fields and summarize experiences, they emphasized the needs of other research projects and refused to release people, at most only willing to release a few trainees or individual junior researchers. This situation aroused opposition from many people in the institute, and at this time, the contradiction became more acute.

　　The Party organization of the Institute of Plant Physiology discovered this situation, first clearly supported the correct demands, and at the same time, timely organized all members of the institute to conduct theoretical discussions and debates on the direction of the institute, refuting various erroneous arguments of the conservatives.

　　Everyone believed that the agricultural high-yield has repeatedly challenged plant physiology, completely exposing the backward state of plant physiology. In essence, it was the bourgeois ideology that opposes the integration of theory with practice and opposes science serving production that suffocated the development of plant physiology. Plant physiology cannot transform nature, change the nature of plants, propose effective insights and measures that are beneficial to agricultural production increase, and even cannot make a strong scientific explanation for the reasons for the leap in production of crops such as wheat and rice. The work of the Institute of Plant Physiology is currently facing a severe test. Without thoroughly changing direction, it will be abandoned by the vast number of peasants and become a laughing stock.

　　Many people cited the facts of research work in recent years to illustrate the consequences of building cars behind closed doors. In the past five years, the Institute of Plant Physiology has invested a lot of manpower and material resources in the research of cotton boll shedding. Under single-factor experiments, some causes of shedding have also been found. In the minds of some researchers, finding this cause is considered to have exceeded the records of foreign literature and can be said to be work of international level. However, this research has not solved the actual problems in cotton production, and it has always failed to answer directly the urgent need to solve the problem of how to reduce the shedding of buds and bolls to the minimum. The research on rational fertilization of wheat has been planned very detailed and meticulous, but it has not been combined with the goal of increasing production, and no comprehensive factor research has been conducted, only entangled in the effect of fertilization at a certain growth stage of wheat. Although the best equipment and fertilizers were used, and root washing, analysis, and other work were done, the yield per mu was only three or four hundred catties. Everyone believed that how can this kind of "theory" that cannot guide practice be called a theory? This kind of dispute over research methods is essentially a dispute over research direction. Research methods serve the research purpose. If we want to combine research work with production practice to improve production, we must abandon the past pure laboratory single-factor analysis method and should especially focus on field experiments and comprehensive experimental methods. Single-factor experiments should also be combined with agricultural work and serve agricultural field experiments.

　　Regarding the issue of the peasants' creative labor achievements, the conservatives' attitude particularly aroused people's indignation. Many researchers pointed out: After reading books for decades, the "authoritative people" who have mastered "profound" theories cannot solve the problems themselves and also desperately belittle the creations of the masses. Our peasants have paid hard work and exerted great wisdom for the people of the whole country to eat more and dress warmly, creating a high-yield record that the world has never seen before, making scientific and technical experts speechless, while the experts use the best equipment and a large amount of manpower and funding, and the yield they get is not even a fraction of that of the peasants. Who is scientific and who is unscientific? People pointed out that the era of a few people monopolizing science has gone forever, and the working people are rapidly mastering science and technology. There is no way out for intellectuals if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, and scientific research if it does not combine with practice.

　　After a face-to-face struggle, the conservatives were refuted and left speechless, and the masses' awareness and enthusiasm were greatly improved. The understanding gradually tended to be consistent, and a movement of everyone offering suggestions and ideas was enthusiastically launched. On this basis, the Institute of Plant Physiology disrupted the original practice of grouping by discipline and changed to grouping according to research tasks. More than 60% of the scientific workers in the institute, including senior, intermediate, and junior researchers and technicians, were mobilized to form four work teams for rice, wheat, cotton, and oil crops. They went deep into Nanjing, Jinshan, Anyang, Macheng and other places to establish bases, and under the leadership of the local Party committee, they worked with the peasants to vigorously carry out high-yield experimental fields. The scientific workers who were sent down were full of confidence in combining the peasants' high-yield experiences with scientific theoretical research to create higher high-yield records and propose specific measures for large-scale promotion. Currently, three work teams have already gone down, and another team is about to set off.

　　The scientific research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai all participated in the debate of the Institute of Plant Physiology, learned from the lessons, and at the same time, combined with the situation of their own units, criticized various ideas that hindered the leap forward, uprooted white flags, planted red flags, and welcomed the further leap forward in ideological and scientific research work.

### 走出象牙塔  踏进试验田  植物生理所扭转资产阶级研究方向

　　走出象牙塔  踏进试验田
    植物生理所扭转资产阶级研究方向
    新华社上海23日电　农业生产战线上丰产“卫星”一个接一个上天，丰产成绩愈来愈惊人，这一逼人的新形势，在中国科学院植物生理研究所引起了一场科学研究中两条道路的大辩论：是在资产阶级专家领导下，继续躲在象牙之塔里，孤芳自赏地进行一些远远落后于生产实践的“理论研究”呢？还是在党的领导下，深入农村，学习和总结农民的丰产经验，专家和群众相结合，建立起新的能够指导生产实践的植物生理学呢？这个研究所的科学工作者经过尖锐的斗争，终于找到了正确的方向。
    植物生理研究所全体人员在双反运动期间就曾对理论联系实际问题展开过辩论。在大多数人的要求下，研究所的领导人和有些研究人员口头上也同意组织工作队参加试验田，但在思想上有着很大的抵触。那时，派下乡的科学工作者一共只有六个人，下去的目的也不够明确。研究所还给他们安排了别的任务。五、六月以来，各地农业丰产新纪录不断出现在研究所的墙报上，全体研究人员分别参观了江苏、浙江和上海的农村。农民的冲天干劲和无穷的智慧，使许多青年研究人员和一些识时务的科学家深深感到自己太落后了，他们纷纷要求深入农村，拜农民为师，总结丰产经验，从中研究植物的生理规律，以达到大面积的丰产。但是所内以权威的前辈专家自居的保守派认为，增加农业生产是农业部门的事，植物生理学的研究可以而且应该不去直接解决农业问题，植物生理学家的责任在于说明自然界的植物生理规律，至于改造自然世界，则不是他们的事，否则就是把植物生理学降低到农业科学的“身价”。他们认为，植物生理学作为一门理论学科，它的研究方法主要就是在实验室中进行人工控制的单因子的试验，得出植物生长发育的某些规律，至于大田的综合性农业实践是粗放的，不精确的，不科学的。因此，搞试验田只是把科学庸俗化，是葬送植物生理学。但是对农业高额丰产的事实，就连保守派也无法推翻，于是他们又制造出一种怪论说：农民的创造只是大量付出劳动力的“人海战术”，不是什么科学，不值得重视。保守派不仅自己不愿深入农村总结丰产经验，还对积极要求这样做的人采取打击、阻挠的态度，讽刺他们是无知、投机、假积极、赶浪头。在抽调人员去参加试验田和总结经验时，他们强调别的研究项目的需要，不肯放人，最多只肯放几个见习员或个别初级研究人员。这种情况引起所内很多人的反对，这时矛盾就更加尖锐了。
    植物生理研究所的党组织发现了这个情况，首先明确地支持正确的要求，同时及时组织全所人员务虚，在研究所的方向问题上展开辩论，对保守派的各种错误论点进行了驳斥。
    大家认为，农业的高额丰产已经一再向植物生理学将了军，彻底暴露了植物生理学的落后状态。实质上，正是那种反对理论联系实际，反对科学为生产服务的资产阶级思想，窒息了植物生理学的发展。植物生理学既不能改造自然，改变植物本性，提出有益于农业增产的有效见解和措施，甚至也不能对小麦、水稻等作物飞跃增产的原因作出有力的科学说明。目前植物生理研究所的工作确实面临了一场严重的考验，不彻底改变方向，它就会被广大农民所抛弃，成为人们讥笑的材料。
    很多人举出几年来研究工作上的事实，来说明闭门造车的后果。五年来，植物生理研究所以大量人力物力投入棉花蕾铃脱落问题的研究，在单因子试验下也找到了造成脱落的某些原因，在某些研究人员心目中，认为找出这种原因已超过了外国文献的记载，可说是有国际水平的工作了。但是这项研究并没有解决棉花生产中的实际问题，对于迫切需要解决的怎样才能把蕾铃的脱落减少到最低限度的问题，始终不能正面地回答。小麦合理施肥的研究，计划非常详尽周密，但都不和增产的目标结合起来，不进行综合因子的研究，只是纠缠在小麦某个生长时期施肥的效果上。虽然用了最好的设备和肥料，做了洗根、分析等工作，结果每亩产量只有三、四百斤。大家认为这种不能指导实践的“理论”，又怎能称之为理论呢？这种研究方法之争，实质上也还是研究方向之争。研究方法是为研究目的服务的，如果要使研究工作与生产实践相结合，去提高生产，就必须抛弃过去那种单纯的实验室单因子分析方法，应该特别着重大田试验、综合性的试验方法。单因子试验也应该与农田工作相结合，为农田试验服务。
    在对待农民创造性劳动成果问题上，保守派的态度格外引起人们的愤慨，许多研究人员指出：读了几十年书，掌握了“高深”理论的“权威人士”，自己不能解决问题，还要拚命贬低群众的创造。我国农民为全国人民多吃多穿，付出了辛勤的劳动，发挥了极大的智慧，创造了全世界所没有的使科学技术专家为之张口结舌的高额丰产纪录，而专家们用最好的设备和大量的人力经费，得到的产量还不及农民的零数。究竟是谁科学谁不科学呢？人们指出，少数人垄断科学的时代已经一去不复返，劳动人民正在很快地掌握科学技术，知识分子不和工农群众结合，科学研究不和实践结合，是没有出路的。
    经过一场面对面的斗争，保守派被驳得哑口无言，群众的觉悟和积极性大大提高，认识逐渐趋于一致，热烈地开展了人人献计献策的运动。在这个基础上，植物生理研究所打乱了原来以学科分组的作法，改为根据研究任务分组，调动了全所60％以上的科学工作者，包括高级、中级、初级研究人员和技术人员，组成水稻、小麦、棉花、油料作物四个工作队，分别深入南京、金山、安阳、麻城等地建立据点，在当地党委领导下，同农民一道大搞丰产试验田。下放的科学工作者们，满怀信心地要将农民的丰产经验和科学理论研究结合起来，创造更高的丰产纪录和提出大面积推广的具体措施。目前有三个工作队已经下去了，还有一个队也即将出发。
    中国科学院在上海的各个科学研究单位都参加了植物生理研究所的辩论，吸取教训，同时结合本单位的情况，批判了各种各样阻碍跃进的思想，拔白旗，插红旗，迎接思想和科学研究工作上的再跃进。
