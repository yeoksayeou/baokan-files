Opium Traffickers, Past and Present
　　Yi Mo
　　The Chinese people will never forget that more than a hundred years ago, in order to subjugate and rule China at that time, British imperialists were criminals who sold opium on Chinese soil. Moreover, in order to sell opium, they carried out bloody wars of aggression on our sacred soil and incurred a huge debt of blood. This debt of blood has been permanently recorded in Chinese history textbooks and will always be remembered by every Chinese person. Although this criminal case has been going on for more than a hundred years, British imperialists have not abandoned their drug trafficking tactics to this day. Moreover, they have intensified their efforts to use new drugs to poison the Chinese people in Hong Kong.
　　In order to promote their policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, the British imperialist education authorities in Hong Kong have forcibly stipulated the adoption of textbooks compiled and reprinted by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies in Hong Kong and fabricated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Ministry of Education to distort the reality of China; Nanjing is called the capital of China, and Beijing, the true capital of the Chinese people, is called the "old capital." The blue sky and white sun flag of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which has been abandoned by the Chinese people, is described as the national flag of China, and the words "Republic of China" are printed on the map of the People's Republic of China, etc., in an attempt to use these mental poisons transferred from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to poison the second generation of Chinese people living in Hong Kong, conceal the true situation of China from them, and obliterate the existence of the People's Republic of China.
　　It is a very contradictory phenomenon: the current British colonialists are in a much worse situation than their ancestors. At that time, colonialists could run amok in China; but now the colonialists can only abuse the Chinese people in Hong Kong. However, in terms of drug trafficking methods, the current colonialists are far more brutal than their ancestors; they not only sell it, but also force you to swallow it. If you refuse to swallow it, they will impose imprisonment, beatings, persecution, and expulsion. The persecution of the Chung Wah Middle School is one example.
　　However, it is a pity that the era of the imperialist opium war of bullying and acting arbitrarily has passed after all. The great socialist China is developing vigorously with each passing day, constantly inspiring the Chinese residents of Hong Kong. This ironclad fact can never be covered by your small magic claws. The relationship between the Chinese residents of Hong Kong and the motherland is inseparable and connected by flesh and blood. The patriotic residents living in Hong Kong will one day severely judge you criminals like judging opium offenders in history!

　　鸦片贩子的今昔
　　伊默
    中国人民永远不会忘记，在一百多年以前，英帝国主义者为了宰割和统治当时的中国，曾经是中国国土上贩卖鸦片的罪犯，而且为了贩卖鸦片，还在我们的神圣国土上进行过血腥的侵略战争，欠下了一大笔血债。这笔血债已经永远地记载在中国历史教科书里，永远为每一个中国人民所牢记。这个犯罪的案件虽然已经过了一百多年，但是，英帝国主义者到现在还没有抛弃他们贩毒伎俩。而且变本加厉地用新的毒品来毒害香港的中国人了。
    香港英帝国主义教育当局，为了推行他们敌视中华人民共和国的政策，竟强行规定采用在港美蒋特务机关出版和翻版的蒋匪教育部制定的课本，歪曲中国的现实；把南京称为中国的首都，把中国人民真正的首都北京称为“旧都”把中国人民已经唾弃了的蒋匪帮的青天白日旗，说成是中国的国旗，在中华人民共和国的地图上印上“中华民国”字样等等，想用这些从蒋介石匪帮那里转运来的精神毒品，毒害在香港居住的中国人民的第二代，向他们隐瞒中国的真实情况，抹煞中华人民共和国的存在。
    说来，这是一个非常矛盾的现象：现在的英国殖民者，比起他们的祖先来，在处境上说，是大大地不如那时了，那时，殖民主义者还可以在中国横行；而现在的殖民主义者却只能对香港的中国人民滥施一些威福，但是从贩毒的手段上来说现在的殖民主义者却远比它的祖先更为凶残；不只是贩卖，而且是强迫你吞食，倘不肯吞食便施之以牢狱、棍棒、迫害和驱逐。对于中华中学的迫害也就是例证之一。
    但是，很可惜，帝国主义作威作福的鸦片战争的时代毕竟是已经过去了，伟大的社会主义中国日新月异地蓬勃发展，时时在激励着香港的中国居民，这铁一般的事实，是你们那小小的魔掌永远遮不住的。香港的中国居民和祖国的关系，是血肉相连不可分割的。居住在香港的热爱祖国的居民，终究会有一天像审判历史上鸦片烟犯一样，严厉地审判你们这些罪犯！
