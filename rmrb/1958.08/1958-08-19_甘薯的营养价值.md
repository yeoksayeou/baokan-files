　　The Nutritional Value of Sweet Potatoes
    Every pound of fresh sweet potatoes contains 145 grams of carbohydrates (starch), 11.5 grams of protein, and 1 gram of fat. Every pound of sweet potato flour contains 396 grams of carbohydrates, 20 grams of protein, and 3.5 grams of fat. Sweet potatoes are generally converted to grain at a ratio of 4:1. Calculated in this way, the heat generated by four pounds of sweet potatoes is 40% higher than one pound of corn flour, 35% higher than one pound of millet flour, and about 45% higher than rice and white flour. Comparing the same quantity of sweet potato flour, corn flour, white flour, and rice, sweet potato flour contains more starch than all of them.
    In addition to the nutritional components mentioned above, sweet potatoes also contain rich vitamins. Every pound of fresh sweet potatoes contains 6.55 milligrams of carotene and 0.600 milligrams of thiamine. The carotene content of one pound of sweet potatoes is equivalent to the content of ten pounds of corn flour. As for ascorbic acid, other coarse grains simply do not have it, but every pound of sweet potatoes contains 150 milligrams.

　　甘薯的营养价值
    每斤鲜甘薯含碳水化合物（淀粉）一百四十五克、蛋白十一点五克、脂肪一克，每斤甘薯粉含碳水化合物三百九十六克、蛋白二十克、脂肪三点五克。甘薯折合粮食一般是四折一，以这样折合计算，四斤甘薯所产生的热量比一斤玉米粉高40％，比一斤小米粉高35％，比大米、白面高45％左右。以同样数量的甘薯粉、玉米粉、白面、大米来比较，甘薯粉所含的淀粉比它们都多。
    甘薯除了含有上面所说的营养成分以外，还含有丰富的维生素。每斤鲜甘薯含胡萝卜素六点五五毫克、硫胺素零点六零零毫克。每斤甘薯所含的胡萝卜素相当十斤玉米面的含量。至于抗坏血酸，别的杂粮根本没有，每斤甘薯里却含有一百五十毫克。
