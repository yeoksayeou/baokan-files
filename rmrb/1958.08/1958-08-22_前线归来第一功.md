　　First Merit Upon Return from the Front Lines

　　As soon as Xue Jiaxing returned home after being discharged from the army (Fengyang County, Anhui), his parents told him: The other members of the team are very good, but the brothers缪Jin Hou and缪Jin You are too bad. They engage in factionalism, argue about withdrawing from the cooperative, scold the cadres, and speak ill of the Communist Party. His parents also told him a strange thing: The缪family keeps its doors closed all year round and does not associate with other families. Xue Jiaxing became alert upon hearing this. He suddenly remembered that缪Jin Hou's brother-in-law, named Wang Xueyuan, had been a puppet district joint defense captain and had fled after liberation to avoid punishment. From then on, he began to pay attention to the people who came and went to the缪family.

　　Ten days of observation revealed suspicious clues. During this period,缪Jin Hou's sister came to the缪family twice in succession, each time sneaking around, avoiding being seen by others. Xue Jiaxing thought: Wang Xueyuan must be hiding here. But he couldn't find any factual basis for the time being, and he couldn't rashly go to the缪family to search. What should he do?

　　Xue Jiaxing was troubled by this matter. Later, he came up with a clever plan. He often played with缪Jin Hou's children, asking this and that, and finally learned from the children that Wang Xueyuan was hiding in the缪family. At that time, he was so happy that he almost jumped up, but he immediately remembered what the leaders of the army had taught: Fighting requires courage, but also calmness and composure, so as not to suffer losses; to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop, you must first scout out the enemy's lair and positions clearly.

　　Therefore, he used the pretext of inspecting sanitation and the construction of cow tail stoves to scout the缪family twice. He found a dilapidated thatched house under the courtyard wall of the缪family. It was dark inside, filled with furniture, with a passageway in the middle, and a chamber pot on the ground. There were also two rows of deep new footprints on the passageway in front of the thatched house. Although it was not convenient for him to go into the thatched house to check, based on the traces he found, he was sure that Wang Xueyuan was hiding in the thatched house.

　　One day, he, together with the militiamen and township cadres, finally caught this counter-revolutionary villain who had been hiding for several years.

　　前线归来第一功
    薛家兴一退伍回到家里（安徽凤阳县），爹娘就对他说：队里其他社员都很好，唯有缪金厚、缪金友弟兄俩太坏，他们闹宗派，吵退社，骂干部，说共产党的坏话。爹娘还告诉了他一件奇怪的事情：缪家常年地关着大门，不和别家来往。薛家兴一听此话警觉起来，他忽然想起缪金厚有个姐丈名叫王学鸳，曾干过伪区联防队长，解放后畏罪潜逃了。从这以后，他便对缪家来往的人注意起来。
    十天的观察，果然发现了值得怀疑的线索。在这期间，缪金厚的姐姐连续到缪家来了两次，每次来去都是鬼头鬼脑的，避着不让别人看到。薛家兴就想：八成是王学鸳藏在这里。可是一时又找不出事实根据来，又不能冒然到缪家去搜查，怎么办呢？
    薛家兴为这件事苦脑着。后来，他想出了一条妙计，便经常带着缪金厚的小孩子玩耍，问这问那，最后终于从小孩口中探听出王学鸳藏在缪家。当时他高兴得几乎跳了起来，但马上又记起了部队首长所教导的话：打仗要勇猛，也要沉着冷静，才不会吃亏；要想一举歼灭敌人，事先就得把敌人的巢穴阵地侦察清楚。
    于是，他便利用检查卫生和牛尾灶修建情况，到缪家侦察了两次。他发现缪家的院墙底下有一间烂草房，里面黑洞洞的，堆满了家俱，中间留有一条走道，地下还放着一把尿壶。在草房门前的走道上，也留有两行很深的新脚印。他虽然不便于到草房里去察看，但根据所查到的那些迹象，肯定王学鸳藏在草房里。
    一天，他会同民兵和乡干部，终于把这个隐藏了几年的反革命坏蛋抓住了。
