Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: TASS reports: Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Sergei Vernov, announced the day before yesterday that the instruments on the Soviet artificial Earth satellite, used for studying cosmic rays, had recorded a new type of radiation, previously unknown to scientists, and variations in the number of charged particles and photons caused by this radiation. He called this new radiation "Earth Radiation" because it consists of high-energy particles generated near the Earth and orbiting it.

The scientist said that research conducted using Soviet artificial satellites and rockets has shown that there may be two different types of variations in the concentration of charged particles and photons in the Earth's atmosphere. Some of the variations are caused by cosmic rays themselves, so they correspond to variations in the number of original particles in cosmic rays. Another part of the variation is unrelated to cosmic rays.

Under the action of the original cosmic rays and the Earth's surrounding magnetic field, a special "halo" composed of high-energy electrons and other particles is formed. These particles are the products of neutron fission radiated by the Earth under the action of cosmic rays, and the solar corpuscular stream. A large number of such secondary particles may accumulate near the Earth, and they can periodically move from one hemisphere of the Earth to the other.

Vernov said that in order to study cosmic rays with the second and third satellites, new measurement methods were devised to find photons in cosmic rays. The second satellite was equipped with two instruments consisting of charged particle counters and semiconductor conversion equipment. The third satellite was equipped with highly sensitive photomultiplier tubes.

Vernov pointed out that the use of such instruments on satellites can solve a series of important problems, the first of which is to map the distribution of cosmic rays on the Earth's surface, thereby studying the Earth's magnetic field.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: TASS reports: Preliminary calculations show that the carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite will exist for about half a year from the time it enters orbit, while the satellite itself will exist for more than a year and a half.

The Soviet Union's third satellite and its carrier rocket have been orbiting the Earth for more than two and a half months. During this period, the orbital period of the third satellite decreased from 105.95 minutes to 105.02 minutes. The rocket's orbital period has decreased by 3.3 minutes from the initial period, and is now 102.65 minutes. The maximum altitudes of the satellite and rocket have decreased by 90 kilometers and 310 kilometers, respectively.

When the sky is clear and cloudless on August 3, the satellite and rocket can be seen with the naked eye after sunset in the area between 42 and 63 degrees north latitude, and the satellite can be seen before sunrise in the area between 34 and 64 degrees south latitude, and the rocket can be seen in the area between 45 and 64 degrees south latitude.

At 15:18 Beijing time on August 4, the satellite will pass over Shanghai, and at 15:22 it will be over Vladivostok in the Soviet Union, and it can be observed by radio technology methods.

    红色巨星的又一巨大贡献
    苏联科学家宣布发现“地球辐射”
    卫星将存在一年半，运载火箭可存在半年
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院通讯院士谢尔盖·维尔诺夫前天宣布，苏联人造地球卫星研究宇宙线的仪器记录了科学家以前尚未知道的一种新辐射和这种辐射所引起的带电粒子和光子数目的变异。他称这种新辐射为“地球辐射”，因为它是一些在地球附近产生并围绕地球运动的高能粒子。
    这位科学家说，用苏联人造卫星和火箭所进行的研究表明，地球大气圈内的带电粒子和光子的浓度，可能有两种不同类型的变异。一部分变异是由宇宙线本身所引起的，所以它同宇宙线中原始粒子数量的变异是相应的。另一部分变异与宇宙线无关。
    在原始宇宙线和地球周围磁场的作用下，形成了一个由高能电子和其他粒子组成的特殊的“晕圈”。这些粒子是地球在宇宙线作用下辐射出的中子裂变的产物和太阳的微粒流。在地球附近可能积有大量的这种二级粒子，并且它们可以周期地从地球的这一半球运动到另一半球去。
    维尔诺夫说，为了用第二个和第三个卫星研究宇宙线，曾经拟定了在宇宙线中寻找光子的新测量方法。在第二个卫星上装的是两个由带电粒子计数器和半导体换算设备组成的仪器。第三个卫星装的是高度灵敏的微光计数器。
    维尔诺夫指出，利用卫星上的这种仪器可以解决一系列重要问题，首先是绘制出地球表面宇宙线分布图，从而对地球磁场进行研究。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：初步计算表明，苏联第三个人造卫星的运载火箭从进入轨道时算起，将存在半年左右，而这个卫星本身则将存在一年半以上。
    苏联第三个卫星及其运载火箭已经围绕地球运行了两个半月以上了。在这个期间里，第三个卫星的运行周期从一○五·九五分钟减少到一○五·○二分钟。火箭运行周期比最初减少了三·三分钟，现为一○二·六五分钟。卫星和火箭的最大高度分别降低了九十公里和三百一十公里。
    8月3日天空晴朗无云时，北纬四十二度到六十三度之间地区在傍晚日落之后可以用肉眼看到卫星和火箭，在清晨日出前南纬三十四度到六十四度之间地区可以看到卫星，南纬四十五度到六十四度之间地区可以看到火箭。
    8月4日北京时间十五点十八分，卫星经过上海，十五点二十二分到苏联的海参崴，可以用无线电技术方法观测到。
