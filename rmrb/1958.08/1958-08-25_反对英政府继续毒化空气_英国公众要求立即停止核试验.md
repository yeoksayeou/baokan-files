Xinhua News Agency, London, August 23rd: The British public has expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions for halting nuclear weapons testing put forward by the government last night, and they are demanding that the government immediately cease all nuclear testing.

　　The "Daily Worker" said in a commentary that world opinion has forced the West to change its previous attitude. But the decision to continue testing rather than immediately stop testing will shock the world.

　　The "Daily Worker" said that the British people will ask: "Mr. Macmillan, why not now, why not stop British hydrogen bomb tests today? Why not immediately start negotiations with the Soviet Union on an agreement to halt all tests?"

　　The "Daily Herald" said, "The West's proposal very reluctantly postpones the actual date of stopping the tests to the date when negotiations are proposed, which disappoints us." This is clearly to allow more British bombs to poison the air. The newspaper added: "This is so unnecessary, so foolish."

　　The British Peace Committee issued a statement late yesterday, calling on the people to rise up and force the government to immediately stop testing nuclear weapons. The statement said: "Scientists in Geneva have reported that all tests can be banned and the ban can be monitored. Therefore, Britain's continued testing of atomic weapons is completely against the wishes of the people of the world. It will cause great hatred among the people of Asia, because we are using their land for testing."

　　The "Manchester Guardian" wrote in a commentary on the results of the Geneva technical experts meeting that there is now no reason for Western countries to continue testing nuclear weapons. The newspaper believes that "there is now a good opportunity to take the first practical steps in disarmament with Russia." The newspaper's foreign affairs commentator believes that the British government's decision to conduct a new series of nuclear weapons tests in the Christmas Island area will put it in a "very unpleasant situation."

　　反对英政府继续毒化空气
    英国公众要求立即停止核试验
    新华社伦敦23日电　英国公众对政府昨晚所提出的关于停止核武器试验的条件表示不满，他们要求政府立即停止一切核试验。
    “工人日报”在评论中说，世界舆论已经迫使西方改变它先前的态度。但是继续进行试验而不是立即停止试验的决定，将使世人大为震惊。
    “工人日报”说，英国人民会问：“麦克米伦先生，为什么不是现在，为什么不在今天停止英国的氢弹试验呢？为什么不立即同苏联开始谈判停止一切试验的协议呢？”
    “每日先驱报”说，“西方的建议十分勉强地把实际停止试验的日期推迟到建议开始谈判的日子，这使我们感到失望。”这显然是要让更多的英国炸弹来毒化空气。这家报纸又说：“这是多么不必要，多么愚蠢。”英国和平委员会在昨天深夜发表了一项声明，号召人民起来迫使政府立即停止试验核武器。声明中说：“日内瓦的科学家们已经提出报告说，一切试验都可以禁止，禁令都可以监督。因此，英国继续试验原子武器是完全违反世界人民的愿望。它将引起亚洲人民的极大憎恨，因为我们是用他们的土地来进行试验的。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”在评论日内瓦技术专家会议的结果时写道，现在西方国家没有任何理由来继续试验核武器了。报纸认为，“现在已经有良好的机会来同俄国一起在裁军方面采取第一步实际措施”。这家报纸的外交评论员认为，英国政府现在决定在圣诞岛地区进行一系列新的核武器试验，将使它自己处于“非常不愉快的境况中”。
