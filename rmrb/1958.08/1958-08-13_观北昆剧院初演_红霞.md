Watching the premiere of "Red Glow" by the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre
Mao Dun

1.  Of all the new voices, "Red Glow" is the most remarkable,
    The story of buried jade and resurrection is not worth boasting about;
    The trend of valuing the ancient and belittling the modern is finally reversed,
    Lord Guan, Tang, and Confucius are too extravagant and pretentious!

2.  Waving the wind and thunder, exposing the deceitful White bandits,
    Parting the clouds and mists, shining the red glow;
    With mournful silk and heroic bamboo, singing the praises of heroes,
    This is the leap forward flower of Northern Kunqu.

　　观北昆剧院初演“红霞”
　　茅盾一新声孰最数红霞，埋玉还魂未许夸；厚古薄今终扭转，关王汤孔太奢遮！二挥斥风雷诳白匪，喝开云雾耀红霞；哀丝豪竹颂英烈，此是北昆跃进花。
　　　　　　八月九日夜
