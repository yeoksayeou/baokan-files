Chairman Mao Proposed Establishing an Independent Local Industrial System During His Inspection in Tianjin
　　First, cooperation zones, then many provinces, should all establish relatively independent but different industrial systems, provided they have the conditions.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 15th: Chairman Mao Zedong conducted an inspection in Tianjin City from August 10th to 13th.
　　Chairman Mao inspected the rice paddies of the Xinli Village Agricultural Cooperative in Sihe Zhuang Township, East Suburb District, the factories run by teachers and students of Tianjin University and Nankai University, and visited the Tianjin Industrial Technology Revolution Exhibition and the Tianjin Import and Export Commodity Exhibition Hall. Wherever Chairman Mao went, he spoke cordially with workers, farmers, students, and cadres, and gave important instructions on various tasks. Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Hebei Province, and Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Tianjin, accompanied Chairman Mao on the inspection.
　　Chairman Mao inspected large rice paddies at the Xinli Village Agricultural Cooperative. At the edge of the rice paddies, Chairman Mao saw red flags with "Upstream" written on them planted on the ridges and asked Zhang Fu'an, head of the East Suburb District, what this meant. Zhang Fu'an said: "Every ten days, the production teams in the cooperative conduct an evaluation of rice paddy management. After the evaluation, first-class seedlings are marked with ‘Upstream’ flags, while second and third-class seedlings are marked with ‘Midstream’ and ‘Downstream’ flags to urge the second and third-class seedlings to quickly catch up with the first-class seedlings." Chairman Mao asked with concern, "Can they still catch up now?" Zhang Fu'an said, "Yes, they can. Weak seedlings can catch up if they are given more fertilizer and their later-stage management is strengthened." Pointing to the rice paddy with the "Upstream" flag, he said: "This rice paddy was originally 'Midstream.' The members put more effort into management, and in half a month, they achieved 'Upstream'." Chairman Mao nodded with a smile. While watching, Chairman Mao inquired about the close planting and deep plowing of rice. Chairman Mao walked to the reed field and pointed to the reed field, saying to everyone: "This is a good thing; it doesn't require weeding or fertilizing, and it's harvested once a year." Zhang Fu'an said: "We want to crossbreed rice and reeds so that they will grow into rice ears and reed stalks in the future." Chairman Mao was very pleased to hear this and said that this idea was very good and could be tried.
　　On the afternoons of the 11th and 12th, Chairman Mao visited the Tianjin Import and Export Commodity Exhibition Hall and the Tianjin Industrial Technology Revolution Exhibition, praising the achievements and creative spirit of the workers. During the visit, Chairman Mao was very concerned about every invention and technical improvement. At the Industrial Technology Revolution Exhibition, Chairman Mao met with Liang Shukai, Liu Zhenqi, Sun Shougang, and other famous technical innovation experts in Tianjin, shook hands and talked with them cordially, and encouraged them to continue their efforts.
　　During a break, Mayor Li Gengtao reported to the Chairman on the current main situation of Tianjin's industry. Chairman Mao instructed: "Local areas should find ways to establish independent industrial systems. First, cooperation zones, then many provinces, should all establish relatively independent but different industrial systems, provided they have the conditions. What about you?" Governor Liu Zihou replied at the time that they were now starting to move in the direction of independence and would be able to establish it in three to five years. Chairman Mao was very concerned about when the local industrial base in special zones and counties could be established. Zhao Ke, First Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee, who accompanied Chairman Mao on the inspection, reported on the situation of non-mountainous areas organizing the masses to go to mountainous areas to mine and develop iron and steel in a big way. The Chairman praised this very much, saying: "With grain and steel, everything will be easy to handle."
　　On the morning of the 13th, Chairman Mao visited Nankai University and Tianjin University. Thousands of students warmly welcomed Chairman Mao. Teachers and students of Tianjin University have built their own buildings and factories and have established more than 130 factories and workshops, producing many products such as silicon steel, lathes, and chemical drugs. Chairman Mao visited the machine factory, foundry, and sulfuric acid plant in succession. In these factories, some students were operating lathes, and some were making molds. Chairman Mao stopped in front of almost every machine tool to carefully observe the students' operations. The Chairman walked up to Zhang Meizhen, a second-year female student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering who was operating a shaper, and asked her: "Is it good to work while studying?" Zhang Meizhen replied excitedly: "It's great. We have theoretical knowledge and have learned practical operations." She said that they had only been working for a few months and had already made many products. Chairman Mao said to Principal Zhang Guofan very happily: "The school is a factory, the factory is also a school, and the agricultural cooperative is also a school; they should be run well." The Chairman added: "We must be practical. Science reflects reality and speaks of practical principles. How can it work to only talk about the principles in books without knowing reality?" Liu Zihou reported to Chairman Mao that some people had concerns that engaging in work-study programs would affect the quality of teaching, but in fact, learning was even better when work-study programs were implemented. The Chairman said with a smile that Changge County in Henan Province had already proven this. Some schools there had implemented work-study programs, and the students' academic performance was good, and many went on to higher education. Some had not implemented work-study programs, and the students did not learn well, and fewer went on to higher education. Chairman Mao also instructed that not only students should engage in work-study programs, but teachers should also. Government cadres should also run some affiliated factories; otherwise, they will only talk empty talk and be divorced from reality. Chairman Mao heard that the teachers and students were very enthusiastic about running factories and sometimes stayed up all night to make cars for National Day. The Chairman was very concerned about the health of the teachers and students, and he repeatedly urged the principal and the Party secretary to ensure that the teachers and students worked and rested rhythmically.
　　When Chairman Mao left Tianjin University and went to the Zhengyangchun Restaurant to rest, tens of thousands of citizens gathered on the street in front of the restaurant, chanting "Long live Chairman Mao" in unison. Chairman Mao went to the window several times and waved to the citizens.
　　Chairman Mao's inspection and concern for the masses gave the people of Tianjin great encouragement. They are determined to make even greater achievements to respond to Chairman Mao's concern. The members of the Xinli Village Agricultural Cooperative in Sihe Zhuang Township, East Suburb District, held a meeting on the evening of the day Chairman Mao inspected. Cadres and members expressed their determination to do a better job in this year's Great Leap Forward with greater enthusiasm and to ensure that the cooperative achieves a per-mu yield of 2,000 jin of rice. After the meeting, the cooperative cadres studied measures for high rice yields based on Chairman Mao's instructions and immediately prepared for the rice-reed hybridization experiment. Nankai University held a radio conference that evening with the participation of all teachers, students, and staff members, calling for better work and academic achievements to repay Chairman Mao's concern. Tianjin University also held a cadre meeting on the evening of the day Chairman Mao inspected, discussing measures to further implement the policy of combining labor and education and to strengthen scientific research.

    毛主席在天津视察的时候提出
　　建立地方独立工业体系
　　首先是协作区，然后是许多省，只要有条件，都应建立比较独立的但是情况不同的工业体系
    新华社天津15日电　毛泽东主席8月10日到13日在天津市进行了视察。
    毛主席在天津市视察了东郊区四合庄乡新立村农业社的稻田、天津大学和南开大学师生开办的工厂，参观了天津市工业技术革命展览会和天津出进口商品陈列馆。毛主席每到一处，都同工人、农民、学生、干部亲切地谈话，并且对各项工作作了重要指示。随同毛主席视察的有中共河北省委书记处书记、河北省省长刘子厚，中共天津市委书记处书记、天津市市长李耕涛等。
    毛主席在新立村农业社视察了大片稻田。在稻田边上，毛主席看到田埂上插着“上游”的红旗，就问东郊区区长张福安这是什么意思。张福安说：“社里各个生产队每隔十天就对稻田管理评比一次，评比后一类苗就插上‘上游’旗，二类、三类苗插上‘中游’‘下游’旗，督促二、三类苗很快赶上一类苗。”毛主席关切地问：“现在还能赶吗？”张福安说：“能赶。弱苗只要多施肥，加强后期管理，就能赶上。”他指着插着“上游”旗的稻田说：这块稻田原来是“中游”，社员们在管理上加了劲，半月功夫，就争到了“上游”。毛主席笑着点点头。毛主席一边看，一边询问水稻密植、深耕的情况。毛主席走到苇田边上，指着苇田对大家说：这是好东西，不锄草不施肥，一年一收。张福安说：我们想把稻子和苇子进行杂交，将来长成稻子穗、苇子秸。毛主席听了很高兴，他说这个想法很好，可以试一试。
    11日和12日下午，毛主席先后参观了天津出进口商品陈列馆和天津市工业技术革命展览会，对职工们的劳动成就和创造精神表示赞扬。毛主席在参观的时候，对于每一件创造发明、技术改进都很关心。在工业技术革命展览会上，毛主席会见了天津市著名的技术革新能手梁树楷、刘振起、孙守纲等人，和他们一一亲切地握手、谈话，鼓励他们继续努力。
    在休息的时候，李耕涛市长向主席汇报了天津工业当前的主要情况。毛主席指示：地方应该想办法建立独立的工业体系。首先是协作区，然后是许多省，只要有条件，都应建立比较独立的但是情况不同的工业体系。你们怎么样？刘子厚省长当时回答说，现在开始向独立方向搞，三、五年能够建立起来。毛主席很关心专区、县的地方工业基础什么时候能建立起来。随同毛主席视察的中共天津地委第一书记赵克汇报了非山区组织群众到山区去开矿、大搞钢铁的情况以后，主席很称赞，他说：一个粮食、一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了。
    13日上午，毛主席到南开大学和天津大学视察。几千名学生热烈欢迎毛主席。天津大学师生自己盖楼房、盖工厂，已经开办了一百三十多个工厂、车间，生产了矽钢、车床、化学药品等许多产品。毛主席先后参观了机工厂、铸工厂和硫酸厂。在这几个工厂里，学生们有的在开动车床，有的做坯型。毛主席几乎在每台机床前面都停下来，详细地观看学生们的操作。主席走到正在操纵牛头刨床的机械系二年级女生张美珍的跟前，问她：“勤工俭学好不好？”张美珍兴奋地回答：“太好了，有了理论知识，又学会了实际操作。”她说，她们开始劳动不到几个月，就已经做出了许多产品。毛主席十分高兴地对张国藩校长说：学校是工厂，工厂也是学校，农业合作社也是学校，要好好办。主席又说：要讲实际，科学是反映实际，是讲实际的道理。不知道实际，老讲书本上的道理怎么成？刘子厚向毛主席汇报说，有些人有顾虑，怕搞勤工俭学影响了教学质量，实际上搞了勤工俭学，学习才更好。主席笑着说，河南省的长葛县已经有了证明，那里的学校有的搞了勤工俭学，学生学习成绩好，升学的很多；有的没有搞勤工俭学，学生学的不好，升学的少。毛主席还指示，不仅学生要搞勤工俭学，教师也要搞。机关干部也要办点附属工厂，不然光讲空的，脱离实际。毛主席听说师生们办工厂的劲头很大，为了在国庆节作出汽车，有时一天一夜不睡觉。主席很关心师生的健康，他一再嘱咐校长和党委书记，要师生有节奏地劳动和休息。
    当毛主席离开天津大学，到正阳春饭店休息的时候，成千上万的市民聚在饭店门前的街道上，齐声欢呼“毛主席万岁”。毛主席几次走到窗前，向市民们招手致意。
    毛主席的视察和对群众的关怀，给天津市人民极大的鼓舞。他们决心作出更大的成就来回答毛主席的关怀。东郊区四合庄乡新立村农业社的社员，在毛主席视察的那天晚上，开了大会。干部和社员表示决心要以更大的干劲搞好今年的大跃进，保证实现全社亩产水稻两千斤。社干部们在会后，又根据毛主席的指示，研究了水稻丰产的措施，并立即准备稻苇杂交的试验工作。南开大学当晚召开了全校师生员工参加的广播大会，要以更好的工作、学习成绩报答毛主席的关怀。天津大学在毛主席视察的当天晚上，也召开了干部会议，讨论了进一步贯彻执行劳动与教育相结合的方针和加强科学研究工作的措施。
