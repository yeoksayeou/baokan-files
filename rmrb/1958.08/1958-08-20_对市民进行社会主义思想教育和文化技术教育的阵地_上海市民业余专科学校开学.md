Shanghai, August 19th (Reporter from this newspaper) - The Caoyang New Village Citizens' Spare-Time College, the first of its kind established in Shanghai after liberation, opened on August 18th. Also opening at the same time were five newly established Caoyang New Village Citizens' Spare-Time Middle Schools.

This is a new type of spare-time college, with three departments: politics, medical services, and teacher training. After one to two years of study, students will become theoretical workers skilled in following the mass line, nurses with intermediate medical skills, and teachers for community-run middle schools.

This college was established by the masses and office cadres of Caoyang New Village after breaking down superstitions and emancipating their minds. Initially, they believed that only people with a high school education could enter the college, and there were very few residents in the area with that level of education. Therefore, they worried that no one would enroll after the school was established. Through debate, the cadres realized that the purpose of running the school was to use it as a base for conducting socialist ideological education and cultural and technical education for citizens, to cultivate the broad masses of housewives into labor reserves for industrial and agricultural production with socialist consciousness and culture, and a large number of various types of staff who meet the needs of community-run welfare undertakings. With the direction of running the school clarified, the office cadres coordinated with the overall leap forward plan of Caoyang New Village, planning to popularize education to the middle school level within two years and to the university level within three to six years. Therefore, it was decided to first open a spare-time college and five spare-time middle schools, with each family committee establishing a middle school class. Anyone with a secondary education level can enroll. The political department of this school focuses on the study of philosophy and is led by the propaganda department of the district party committee, with cadres from the office and police station serving as teachers; the medical department studies five courses including maternal and child health and hygiene, with cadres from Putuo Hospital and Caoyang New Village Health Center serving as teachers; the teacher training department studies Chinese, mathematics, and physical chemistry, with students from East China Normal University serving as teachers.

The five spare-time middle schools also stipulate that anyone who has shed their illiteracy can enroll. In addition to learning cultural subjects such as politics, Chinese, and mathematics, students also learn technical subjects such as sewing, hairdressing, cooking, accounting statistics, and childcare. Cultural subjects are taught by the original teachers of the spare-time elementary school, and technical subjects are taught by cooks and hairdressers from the Caoyang New Village stores. The school buildings are all located in public schools, and the study time is set for three evenings a week.

When the office announced this decision to the masses, it was immediately warmly welcomed by the broad masses, especially housewives. So far, nearly two thousand people have registered for enrollment, of which more than two hundred are entering the college. Currently, a learning craze has been set off in Caoyang New Village. It is expected that in the near future, a new look of "everyone learning, everyone working" will appear in Caoyang New Village.

　　上海市民业余专科学校开学
    本报上海19日电  上海市解放后建立的第一个工人住宅区曹杨新村市民业余专科学校在8月18日开学。同时开学的还有新办的五所曹杨新村市民业余中学。
    这是一所新型的业余专科学校，设有政治、医务和师范三个系，学员学习一到二年以后，将成为善于走群众路线的理论工作者、具有中等医务水平的护士和民办中学的教师。
    这所专科学校，是在曹杨新村的群众和办事处干部破除迷信，解放思想后办起来的。开始，他们认为必须具有高中毕业文化水平的人才能进专科学校，而地区里具有这样文化水平的居民是很少的，因此他们担心办起学校以后没有人入学。通过辩论，干部们认识到他们办学的目的是要以学校作为对市民进行社会主义思想教育和文化技术教育的阵地，培养广大家庭妇女成为具有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的工农业生产的劳动后备军，和大批适应地区民办福利事业需要的各种工作人员。办学的方向明确了，办事处干部即配合曹杨新村整个事业跃进规划，计划在两年内普及到中学水平，三年到六年内普及到大学水平，因此决定先开办一所业余专科学校和五所业余中学，各家属委员会设一个中学班。具有中等文化程度就可以入学。这所学校的政治系以学习哲学为主，在区委宣传部领导下，由办事处和派出所干部担任教师；医务系学习妇幼卫生、卫生学等五门课，由普陀医院和曹杨新村卫生所干部担任教师；师范系学习语文、数学和物理化学，由华东师范大学的学生担任教师。
    五所业余中学也规定只要摘掉文盲帽子的人都可以入学，除了一所是四年制外，其余四所都是三年制。学生除了学习政治、语文、数学等文化课外，还学习缝纫、理发、烹饪、会计统计、保育等技术课。文化课由原来的业余小学的教师担任，技术课由曹杨新村商店里的炊事员、理发师等担任教员。这些学校的校舍都设在公立学校里，学习时间规定每周三个晚上。
    当办事处把这个办学决定向群众宣布后，立即得到广大群众、特别是家庭妇女的热烈欢迎。到目前为止，报名入学的已近两千人，其中有二百多名是进专科学校的。现在，曹杨新村已掀起了一个学习热潮，预料在不久以后，曹杨新村将出现一个“人人学习、人人劳动”的新面貌。
