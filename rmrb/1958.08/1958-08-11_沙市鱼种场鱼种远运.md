Shashi Fish Farm's Long-Distance Transportation of Fish Fry

    (Our Newspaper) Buoyed by the Party's General Line, the employees of the Shashi Fish Farm in Hubei Province have achieved remarkable results in tripling fish fry production.

    Thanks to the liberation of their thinking and the breaking down of old conventions to establish new practices, the farm's employees have created many advanced techniques in feeding, weed removal, transportation, and baiting, and have raised a large number of high-quality fish fry. As of the end of July, they had sold 38.6 million fish fry, exceeding the annual production of 1957 by 55%. There are still 35 million fish fry in the farm. These fish fry have been sold to Sichuan, Guangdong, Hunan, Henan and other four provinces, and Jian Shi, Yicheng, Gong An, Nan Zhang, Jing Shan, Zhong Xiang and other counties in the province, strongly supporting the overall leap forward in agricultural production.

    This year, these fish fry are strong and healthy, and of excellent quality, mostly grass carp, silver carp, common carp, and bighead carp, which are favored by the masses of farmers.

　　沙市鱼种场鱼种远运
    本报讯　湖北省沙市鱼种场职工在党的总路线的鼓舞下，已经取得了鱼种翻三番的优异成绩。
    该场职工由于解放了思想，破陈立新，在饲养、除野、运输、施饵各方面创造了许多先进的技术，养殖了大批的优良鱼种。截至7月底止，已销售三千八百六十万尾鱼种，超过1957年年产量55％，现在场内还存三千五百万尾。这些鱼种远销四川、广东、湖南、河南等四省，和本省的建始、宜城、公安、南漳、京山、锺祥等县，大力地支援了农业生产全面大跃进。
    今年这些鱼种膘壮体健，品种优良，大部都是农民群众所喜悦的草鱼、连鱼、里鱼和鳙鱼。
