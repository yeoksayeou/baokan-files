The new look of Saishang Mountain Town

　　Shizuishan Town, a newly emerging industrial town on the northern edge of the Ningxia region, had only one nearly bankrupt porcelain factory at the time of liberation. Now, at the foot of the Helan Mountains, the sound of blasting from the coal mine construction team opening up the mountains and caves can be heard from time to time; the tall chimneys of the power plant and the porcelain factory emit thick smoke; a blast furnace for iron smelting has just been born, and another mechanized cement factory and a coal-to-oil plant are about to start construction; trucks loaded with various building materials shuttle back and forth, and the bus station is busy receiving builders from all over the country. It is truly a vibrant new city!

　　塞上山镇的新貌
    宁夏地区北部边缘上的新兴工业城镇——石咀山镇，解放时镇里只有一个快要倒闭的瓷器厂，现在，贺兰山脚下不时发出煤矿建井队开山辟洞的炮声；发电厂和瓷器厂高大的烟筒冒着浓烟；一座炼铁土高炉刚刚诞生，另一座机械化的水泥厂和一座煤炼油厂又要动工了；满载各种建筑材料的汽车往来奔驰，汽车站忙于接待来自全国各地的建设者们，真是一座生气蓬勃的新城！
