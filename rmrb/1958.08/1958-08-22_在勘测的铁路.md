    Railroad Under Survey
    The survey for the Jinhua to Wenzhou railway has begun. This railway traverses the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang, and most of the line must pass through the mountainside and mountaintops, posing many difficulties for the survey work. However, the survey team members are determined to complete the task two months ahead of schedule.

    在勘测的铁路
    金华至温州的铁路已开始勘测。这条铁路穿行浙南山区，大部分线路要通过山腰和山顶，勘测工作困难很多。但勘测队员们决心提前在两个月内完成任务。
