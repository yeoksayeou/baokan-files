    Undeniable Truth
    Wu Qingfu
    Many times, with excitement, I have read the increasingly high harvest records in the newspapers, and each time, I think of the "wait and see faction" [秋后算账派, literally "autumn harvest reckoning faction," referring to those who are skeptical and want to wait for the final results]. Weren't they going to wait for the reckoning after the autumn harvest? I think, why wait? Aren't the current facts already drawing a clear conclusion?

    Faced with the facts, those "wait and see faction" have already diverged, showing two different attitudes. One attitude is to admit "we are bound to lose"; but they feel fantastical, dazed, and mysteriously puzzled by our world-shocking high-yield records: "How can there be such miracles?"

    In fact, there is nothing strange about this. New records of high yields are by no means a matter of luck, but have roots and sources. This is first, the leadership of the Party; second, the six hundred million people who are organized. The Party has pointed out to us: "It may not take as long as previously thought for our country to catch up with the major capitalist countries in industrial and agricultural production." The reason for this, in the final analysis, is that "in addition to the leadership of the Party, the 600 million population is a decisive factor." Regarding this point, Comrade Liu Shaoqi also said in the report he made on behalf of the Party Central Committee at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "We have a population of more than 600 million, and our Party has formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with this population. Relying on this great strength, we can do whatever human beings can do, or we can do it quickly. There is nothing we cannot do."

    For the "wait and see faction" who admit defeat, as long as they understand this true principle from life and practice, and see the earth-shattering power generated by this true principle, it will be easy to liberate themselves from the mental state of being still trapped in fantasy and mystery! Thus, they can quickly catch up and join the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, moving forward with the times.

    Another attitude is not to admit defeat. Faced with the facts of high yields, these "wait and see faction" are stunned on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are still looking for a "way out" for their inevitable failure. They search for all sorts of reasons in their ideological garbage heaps.

    "Shh! High yields, only on those two or three mu of land, a small matter. From the whole, it may not be like that." This is one of the so-called reasons. It is true that in terms of the total cultivated area, high-yield fields of 10,000 jin or even more than 30,000 jin per mu are indeed still in the minority. However, since the minority has already appeared, it will inevitably develop into the majority. The national summer grain production increased by 41.3 billion jin, and the total wheat output surpassed the United States, ranking second in the world. Could this be achieved by just a few mu of high-yield fields? All these facts, for those "wait and see faction," for those "who once quoted classics to prove that agricultural development can only be slow and cannot be guaranteed," can they add any capital? They cannot. Since they are unwilling to face reality, they have no choice but to turn their backs and sigh!

    "This is nothing, this is the year of good harvest." This seems to be another reason. However, according to the People's Daily: "A bumper harvest in the event of a major disaster. Jiangsu's summer wheat caught up with rice, with 610,000 mu yielding more than 500 jin, and more than 4.7 million mu yielding 300 to 500 jin," which is much higher than the national average yield of winter wheat last year, which was 112.8 jin per mu. This great achievement was achieved by the heroic people of Jiangsu, using their wisdom and tenacious hard work, after overcoming the most serious diseases in 22 years. This is just one example of the ambition of "not being discouraged by disasters, and still striving for 800 jin," but it also destroyed the "year of good harvest" theory of the "wait and see faction."

    Of course, some "wait and see faction" will continue to look for other so-called "reasons" for their destined failure, but no matter how self-righteous they are, our increasingly high-yield records will continue to emerge like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and will not take care of the "wait and see faction"'s disappointment at all.

    What to do? The only way is to surrender to this undeniable truth, admit defeat in the face of the facts, run up, keep up with the times, and strive for the top together with the masses. If you still stand by with your hands behind your back, pacing in circles, then you will be washed aside by the giant waves of continuous revolution and become the dregs of the times.

    无可怀疑的真理
    吴庆福
    我许多次怀着激昂的心情，读着报纸上一个比一个更高的丰产纪录，而且，每一次都想起“秋后算账派”来。他们不是要等待秋后算账的吗？我想，何须等待，现在的事实不是早就已经作出一清二楚的结论来了吗？
    在事实面前，那些“秋后算账派”已经有了分化，表现出两种不同的态度。一种态度是，承认
  “输定了”；但对我们取得这样震惊世界的高额丰产纪录，却又感到奇幻恍惚，神秘莫解：“怎么能有这样的奇迹呢？”
    其实，这并没有什么奇怪，高额丰产新纪录，决不是碰运气，而是有本有源的。这就是第一，有党的领导；第二，有组织起来了的六亿人民。党已向我们指明：“我国在工农业生产方面赶上资本主义大国，可能不需要从前所想的那样长的时间了。”这原因，归根到底还是“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”对于这一点，刘少奇同志代表党中央在“八大”二次会议上所作的报告中也说：“我们有六亿多人口，我们党同这六亿多人口结成了血肉的联系，依靠这个伟大的力量，凡是人类能够做的事，我们都能够做，或者很快就能够做，没有什么事我们不能够做的。”
    对于服输的“秋后算账派”，只要从生活中、从实践中懂得了这个真道理，看清这个真道理所产生的移山倒海的巨大力量，就容易从至今还陷于奇幻恍惚、神秘莫解的精神状态中解放出来！从而急起猛追，赶上大跃进的行列，跟着时代前进。
    另一种态度，是并不服输。在高额丰产的事实面前，这些“秋后算账派”一面目瞪口呆，一面却仍然为他们难逃的失败寻找“出路”。在他们的思想垃圾堆中搜索各种各样的理由。
      “嘘！高额丰产，才那末两三亩田，小意思。从整个来看未必就能这样。”这是所谓理由之一。不错，就耕地总面积来说，万斤以至三万斤以上的高产田，目前果然还是极少数。但是，既然少数已经出现，也就必然能发展成多数。全国的夏粮增产四百一十三亿斤，小麦总产量超过美国跃居世界第二，难道只是几亩丰产田就能达到这样的地步吗？所有这些事实，对于那些“秋后算账派”对于那些“曾经引经据典，证明农业的发展只能是慢慢的，并且是不能保证的人，难道能给增加什么资本么？不能够。他们既然不愿正视现实，只好背转身去长叹息！
    “这不算什么，这是天年。”这似乎又是一种理由。然而，据人民日报载：“重灾情况下的大丰收。江苏三麦赶上了水稻，五百斤以上的六十一万亩，三百到五百斤的四百七十多万亩，”比去年全国冬小麦的每亩平均产量一百一十二斤八两来说，高的多了。这个巨大的成绩，是英雄的江苏人民，用智慧和顽强的干劲，战胜了二十二年来所未有过的严重病害后取得的。这仅仅是“受灾不灰心，照干八百斤”的雄心大志的一个例子，但也使得“秋后算账派”的“天年”论毁灭了。
    自然，有些“秋后算账派”还会为他们注定的失败寻找另外的所谓“理由”的，但是，不管他们怎样的自以为是，我们一个比一个高的丰产纪录照样像雨后春笋般的出现，一点也不会照顾“秋后算账派”的失望情绪。
    怎么办呢？唯一的办法，只有向这无可怀疑的真理投降，在事实面前认输，跑上去，跟着时代前进，和群众一道力争上游。如果还背着手，绕着圈子踱方步，那末，就要被不断革命的巨浪冲击到一旁，成为时代的渣滓。
