    Factory History
    Editor's Note: Recently, some factories in Tianjin have launched activities to compile "Factory History." We have selected some fragments of "Factory History" to introduce to readers. "Factory History" is the history of the working class's labor, life, and struggle. "Factory History" is also mainly written and drawn by the workers themselves, creating their own history. The compilation of "Factory History" will inevitably become a vivid teaching material for the working class to educate themselves and others.

    工厂史
    编者按　最近天津市的部分工厂，开展了编写“工厂史”的活动，我们特选择了一些“工厂史”的片段介绍给读者。“工厂史”是工人阶级劳动、生活、斗争的历史。“工厂史”也是主要由工人自己来动手写出、画出自己的历史。“工厂史”的编写必然成为工人阶级自己教育自己和教育别人的生动教材。
