Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 1st. Workers in Surabaya, Semarang, and Yogyakarta recently held mass rallies in their respective cities, expressing their support for the struggle of the Arab people against US-British aggression.

Leaders of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions spoke at the workers' mass rallies in these three cities.

Djono, General Secretary of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, said at a mass rally in Semarang that the Arab people have gained the support of people all over the world, including the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, in their struggle against imperialism. He said that the world's forces opposing colonialism and war are now strong enough to crush the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. Djono said that now is the time to see whether the United States and Britain intend to continue stubbornly refusing to hold a summit conference and continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan and plot to invade Iraq.

    声援阿拉伯人民　反对美英侵略
    爪哇工人举行示威大会
    新华社雅加达1日电　泗水、三宝垄和日惹的工人最近分别在他们所在的城市举行了群众大会，表示支持阿拉伯各国人民反抗美英侵略的斗争。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会的领袖们分别在这三个城市的工人群众大会上讲了话。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会总书记约诺在三宝垄举行的群众大会上说，阿拉伯各国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中，已经获得了包括苏联和其他社会主义国家在内的全世界人民的支持。他说，目前整个世界的反对殖民主义和战争的力量足够粉碎美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略。约诺说，现在是要看看美国和英国是不是打算继续顽固地拒绝举行政府首脑会议以及继续占领黎巴嫩与约旦和策划侵入伊拉克的时候了。
