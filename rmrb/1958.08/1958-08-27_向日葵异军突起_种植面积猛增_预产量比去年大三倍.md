　　Sunflowers Emerge as a New Force
    Planting Area Increases Sharply; Expected Yield Triples Last Year's
    According to Xinhua News Agency, a new piece of good news has recently arrived from the oil crop production front: a nationwide bumper harvest of sunflowers is a certainty.

    Currently, the flower heads of sunflowers in most areas have drooped, and harvesting will begin in another month. In Heilongjiang Province, early-maturing oilseed sunflower varieties will soon be harvested. According to representatives from various regions attending the National Sunflower On-site Conference in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, sunflowers in various regions this year are generally characterized by thick stalks, large flower heads, and full seeds, with growth exceeding any previous year. In provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi, the diameter of sunflower heads is generally around 20 centimeters, 4 to 5 centimeters larger than last year. In Shanxi Province, the diameter is generally 23 to 24 centimeters, with a considerable number of flower heads reaching 30 centimeters. Dingxiang County recently discovered a batch of extra-large sunflowers in the Heping Agricultural Cooperative, with flower heads reaching 36 centimeters in diameter. Each of these large flower heads can produce about one jin of seeds, equivalent to about twice the yield of ordinary flower heads. According to statistics from the National Sunflower On-site Conference, the total national sunflower production this year is estimated to increase by more than three times compared to last year, and the average yield per unit area is estimated to reach 150 jin, more than double that of last year. Last year, Liaoning Province had an average yield of 103 jin per mu, which was the highest record in the country. This year, all provinces growing sunflowers will exceed this target.

    In the past, sunflowers have not been given much attention. Large-scale development of sunflower production in contiguous areas began this year. In order to ensure simultaneous progress in grain, cotton, and oil, many regions have expanded sunflower cultivation as an important measure. In addition to using saline-alkali land to expand the sunflower area, northern regions have also launched a mass movement to grow sunflowers sporadically. As a result, the national sunflower planting area has developed rapidly this year, with contiguous planting reaching three million mu. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 5 billion sunflower plants have been planted in vacant areas such as in front of and behind houses, in courtyards, along roadsides, and field edges.

    The sunflowers planted in various regions this year were generally characterized by early planning, rapid preparation, early sowing, increased density, artificial assisted pollination, and strengthened field management, thus ensuring vigorous growth.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, more than 80 representatives from all over the country recently held a National Sunflower On-site Conference in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, to summarize the experience of high sunflower yields and comprehensive utilization.

    The conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Light Industry.

    In the past, China's sunflower planting area was very small. This year, inspired by the general leap forward in agriculture, various regions have made great progress in sunflower production under the principle of simultaneous progress in grain, cotton, and oil. In order to promote the strengthening of late-stage field management of sunflowers in various regions to achieve a bumper harvest, and to prepare for expanding the planting area and increasing the yield per unit area next year, the conference first visited the site, discussed and summarized the experience of the great leap forward in sunflower production in Dingxiang County (Dingxiang County has attached great importance to oil crop production in recent years. In 1953, it used severely alkaline land to try planting 300 mu of sunflowers, which has now developed to 50,000 mu). The conference also invited Professor Du Zhuming of Shanxi Agricultural College to give a report on sunflower cultivation from the perspective of biological characteristics, combining with the problems of waterlogging-induced seedling death and diseases found during the visit during the sunflower flowering period.

    The conference pointed out that with the great leap forward in food crops, solving the problem of edible oil for the broad masses of people is becoming increasingly urgent. Sunflowers are resistant to salinity, alkalinity, drought, and waterlogging, have a wide range of adaptability, and have great development prospects. This year's practice in various regions has proved that sunflowers are a high-yield oil crop, and can continue to improve. Therefore, the conference required all regions to further implement the principle of simultaneous leap forward in grain, cotton, and oil, vigorously publicize the benefits of planting sunflowers, enhance the value of sunflowers, and prepare from now on to expand the area and increase production next year.

### 向日葵异军突起  种植面积猛增　预产量比去年大三倍

　　向日葵异军突起
    种植面积猛增　预产量比去年大三倍
    据新华社讯　油料生产战线上最近传来了一个新的喜讯，全国向日葵大丰收已成定局。
    目前，各地向日葵的花盘大部已经垂了头，再有一个月就将收获。黑龙江省早熟油用品种向日葵最近即将开镰收割。据各地到山西省定襄县参加全国向日葵现场会议的代表反映，今年各地向日葵普遍是杆粗盘大籽满，生长情况超过了以往任何一年。山东、河南、吉林、黑龙江、陕西等省的向日葵花盘直径一般在二十公分左右，比去年大四、五公分。山西省一般都有二十三、二十四公分，有相当数量的花盘达到了三十公分。定襄县最近在和平农业社发现了一部分特大葵花，花盘直径达到了三十六公分，这些大花盘每个可以产籽一斤左右，相当于一般花盘产量两倍左右。根据全国向日葵现场会议统计，今年全国向日葵总产量估计可比去年增加三倍多，平均单位面积产量估计可达一百五十斤，比去年翻了一番多。去年辽宁省平均亩产一百零三斤，是全国最高的纪录，今年全国所有种植向日葵的省都将超过这个指标。
    向日葵过去一向没有受到重视，成片地大量发展向日葵生产是从今年开始的。不少地区为了使粮、棉、油齐头并进，把扩大种植向日葵作为一项重要措施。各地除了利用盐碱地扩大向日葵面积外，北方地区并开展了群众性的零星种向日葵运动。因此，今年全国向日葵种植面积有了突飞猛进的发展，成片种植达到了三百万亩；据不完全统计，各地利用房前宅后院内路旁地边等空地总共种了五十亿株向日葵。
    今年各地种的向日葵普遍是布置早、准备快，同时实行早播，增加密度，开展人工辅助授粉，加强田间管理等工作，因而保证了生长旺盛。
    据新华社讯　来自全国的八十多个代表最近在山西省定襄县举行了全国向日葵现场会议，总结向日葵丰产和综合利用的经验。
    这次会议是农业部、轻工业部联合召开的。
    过去我国向日葵种植面积很小。今年农业大跃进，各地在粮、棉、油齐头并进的方针鼓舞下，向日葵生产有了很大发展。会议为了促进各地加强向日葵田间后期管理实现大丰收，并为明年扩大种植面积、提高单位面积产量作准备工作，首先通过现场参观，讨论并总结了定襄县向日葵生产大跃进的经验（定襄县几年来很重视油料生产，1953年利用重碱地试种向日葵三百亩，今年已发展到五万亩）。会议并邀请山西农学院杜竹铭教授结合参观中发现的向日葵花期受涝死苗以及病害等问题，从生物学特性作了向日葵栽培报告。
    会议提出，随着粮食作物大跃进，解决广大人民群众食油问题就愈来愈显得迫切。向日葵耐盐、耐碱、耐旱、耐涝，适应范围较广，发展前途很大，今年各地的实践证明向日葵是高产油料作物，而且还能继续提高。因此，会议要求各地进一步贯彻粮、棉、油齐跃进的方针，大力宣传种植向日葵的好处，提高向日葵的身价，从现在作准备，明年扩大面积、提高产量双管齐下。
