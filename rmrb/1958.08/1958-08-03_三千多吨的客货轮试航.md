Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 2nd. China's largest domestically designed and manufactured coastal passenger-cargo ship, the "Democracy No. 14," underwent a successful sea trial at the Wusongkou port on the morning of August 1st.

	"Democracy No. 14" has a displacement of over 3,300 tons, can load over 500 tons of cargo, and can carry over 400 passengers. It is equipped with bathrooms, restaurants, entertainment rooms, radiators, air conditioning, and other facilities to ensure passenger comfort. It can navigate both southern and northern routes.

	According to the original plan, this passenger-cargo ship was scheduled to be delivered by the end of this year. However, the workers of the Hudong Shipyard, who manufactured this ship, worked day and night, and on July 15th, they launched this passenger-cargo ship ahead of schedule. Then, in just fifteen days, they completed all the work of installing electrical and sanitary equipment, and some auxiliary machines, painting, decoration, and boiler testing, successfully completing this sea trial.

	The icebreaking tugboat "Hangong No. 3" with 960 horsepower also underwent sea trials with the "Democracy No. 14" on the 1st. These two ships will represent the Hudong Shipyard in participating in the shipbuilding Great Leap Forward meeting between Shanghai and Dalian to be held in Shanghai in a few days.

    三千多吨的客货轮试航
    新华社上海2日电　我国自己设计制造的最大的一艘沿海客货轮——“民主十四号”，1日上午在吴淞口试航，十分顺利。
    “民主十四号”排水量为三千三百多吨，能够装货五百多吨，同时载客四百多人，备有保证旅客生活舒适的浴室、餐厅、娱乐室以及水汀、冷气等设备。南方北方航线都可航行。
    按原定计划，这艘客货轮要今年年底才交货。但是制造这艘轮船的沪东造船厂职工，日夜赶工，在7月15日就使这艘客货轮提前下水，接着只用十五天时间，又把电气、卫生设备和部分辅机的安装、油漆、装饰以及锅炉试火等工作全部做好，顺利地完成了这一次试航。
    1日和“民主十四号”一同试航的，还有一艘具有九百六十马力的破冰拖轮——“航工三号”轮。这两艘船将代表沪东造船厂，参加几天后在上海举行的上海和大连两地的造船跃进大会师。
