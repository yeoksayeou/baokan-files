    Flowers Bloom on a Desert Island
    Fang Shi

    This is a real desert island! When Corporal Chen Feilong and his production team came to Central Island in May of last year, the mountains and plains were covered with weeds and wild trees more than one person tall, and the ground was covered with rocks and gravel. Large snakes crawled by their sides, and even birds would not fly away when they saw people. There were no roads to walk on, and not even potable water. There was only a ditch with red water and many small green frogs crawling in it. Their mission was to live here, cultivate wasteland, raise pigs and grow vegetables to supply the comrades guarding the island.

    At night, around a roaring bonfire, the Communist Youth League group held an expanded meeting. They talked freely about the difficulties they faced, and everyone's determination and plans. The more they talked, the more confident they became, and the greater their enthusiasm. They unanimously stated that they would use their labor to turn this desert island into a prosperous paradise, without the need for the country to spend a single penny.

    The next day, they cut down wood, harvested weeds, and chose a sheltered place to build a thatched shed. After their "home" was settled, they set a fire to burn away the weeds and wild trees. "Construction" began like this.

    Reclaiming even a fraction of wasteland was extremely difficult. Standing in the thickets, they couldn't move or bend down. When they tried to cut it down, their hands were pricked and bled profusely. Their clothes were torn, their faces were covered with bloody scratches, and their hands were full of blisters before they could clear a small piece of land. This small piece of land was still covered with large and small stones. So, several people pushed together, pushing the large stones into the sea.

    The soil was very hard, and the two shovels they brought were worn out in a few days. Chen Enzai held the bald shovel handle and said fiercely to the land: "You can wear out the shovel, but you can't wear out the soldier's determination."

    In less than a month, they had reclaimed five acres of vegetable fields and planted Chinese cabbage, bok choy, radishes, lettuce, tomatoes...

    The vegetable seeds sprouted tender green shoots, bringing a touch of spring to this desert island. Suddenly, a typhoon swept away the thatched shed and uprooted the seedlings. Because the wind was too strong, ships could not come, and they ran out of food and went without a meal for two days.

    "If it's blown away, we'll plant it again!" As soon as the wind stopped, the Communist Youth League group leader Quan Guangming led several comrades to replant all the vegetable fields. Soon, it was swept away again, and they replanted again. Finally, the seedlings slowly grew.

    At the end of the year, they transported vegetables to the troops for the first time. When more than 14,000 catties of fresh green vegetables were shipped from the island, the soldiers were naturally happy. However, they were excited about new and greater tasks. In the new year, they will cultivate more land, breed more cattle, pigs, and chickens...

    荒岛鲜花开
    方石
    这是真正的荒岛！陈飞龙下士去年5月，带着他的生产组来到中心洲的时候，满山遍野都长着一人多深的杂树野草，地上堆着石块砂砾，一条一条的大蛇从身边爬过，甚至，鸟见了人都不飞跑。没有人走的路，甚至没有能喝的水，这里只有一个水沟，水是红的，里面爬着很多小青蛙。而他们八个人的任务，就是要在这里住下来，开出荒地，喂猪种菜，供给在岛上守卫的战友们。
    夜晚，围着熊熊的篝火，共青团小组召开了一个扩大会议。他们畅谈着面前的困难，各人的决心、计划。越谈信心越高，劲头越大。他们一致表示，要用自己的劳动，使这个荒岛变成富足的乐园，并且，不要国家拿出一个钱。
    第二天，他们砍伐木材，割野草，选择一块避风的地方，搭起一间草棚。“家”安下来以后，放一把野火，烧掉那些杂树野草。“建设”就这样开始了。
    开出一分荒地都是十分困难的。站在荆棘丛里，迈不开步，弯不下腰，要砍掉它，手一抓，刺得满手流血。衣服挂破了，脸上是横一道竖一道的血痕，手上打满了血泡，才开出一小片地。就在这一小片地上，还堆着大大小小的石块。于是，几个人一齐推，把一个个的大石块，推到大海里。
    土质硬的很，带来的两个洋锹，没几天就磨秃了。陈奀仔握着秃秃的锹把，对着土地狠狠地说：“你能磨秃铁锹，但磨不秃战士的决心。”
    不到一个月，他们已经开出五亩菜地，种上了大白菜、小白菜、萝卜、生菜、西红柿……。
    菜子发出嫩绿的幼芽，给这荒岛上带来了一片春色。忽然一阵台风，把草棚卷走了，把菜苗连根拔掉了。由于风大不能来船，粮食没有了，两天没吃上饭。
    “刮跑了，咱们再种！”风一停，团小组长全广明就带着几个同志，把菜田全部又种上。不久，又被卷走，再种。终于，菜苗慢慢长起来了。
    年底，他们第一次把蔬菜运到部队，当一万四千多斤鲜嫩的青菜，从岛上一船一船运走时，战士们的心情自然是愉快的。不过，他们正为新的、更大的任务而激动着。新的一年里，他们将开出更多的地，繁殖更多的牛、猪、鸡……。
