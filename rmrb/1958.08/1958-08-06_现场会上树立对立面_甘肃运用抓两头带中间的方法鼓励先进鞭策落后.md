Gansu Uses the Method of Grasping Both Ends to Bring Along the Middle to Encourage the Advanced and Spur on the Backward

(Our report) The Industry Inspection Team of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the CPC Lanzhou Municipal Committee fully utilized the method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, convened on-site meetings, set up opposing examples, encouraged the advanced, spurred on the backward, and promoted a high tide of capital construction and production throughout the city.

Recently, the inspection team led the heads of various factories, mines, and capital construction units, as well as some workers, to inspect the Lanzhou Daily Hardware Factory, the Lanzhou Printing and Box-Making Factory, and the Lanzhou Quartz Powder Factory, and conducted on-site evaluations. They found that these three factories adopted two methods and obtained two results, which is a clear contrast in implementing the general line of socialist construction.

The Lanzhou Daily Hardware Factory is merely a small hardware factory producing zippers, thumbtacks, and other small items. It started preparations on April 23rd and, after three months, has already used 15,000 yuan of state investment for construction. However, the factory building has not yet been completed, and the machinery and equipment cannot be put into production. When the inspection team arrived at the factory, the construction workers were heavily engaged in repairing welfare facilities such as workers' dormitories, replacing old-style doors and windows, and replacing earth walls with brick walls. The repair of the main gate alone used 20,000 blue bricks. While the production workshop has not been repaired and four machines have not been unpacked and installed, they have already established a club. The reason for this phenomenon is that politics has not taken command. The hardware factory did not accept the leadership of the local Party committee, and the Anning District Committee did not break the mysterious view of running industry. The Lanzhou Hardware Factory, which was responsible for supporting the new factory, only "plucked feathers" instead of "laying eggs," only transferred three people and then stopped paying attention. The Construction Bank also abandoned its supervision of the use of state investment and allowed it to be squandered. After discovering these problems, the inspection team decided on the spot to transfer the original investment of 250,000 yuan to the district committee for management, immediately stop repairing the dormitories, and switch to building factory buildings and installing equipment, with a deadline to change the backward situation.

At the Lanzhou Printing and Box-Making Factory and the Lanzhou Quartz Powder Factory, the inspection team saw a completely different picture. The Lanzhou Box-Making Factory started preparations on April 26th, later than the hardware factory, and had less investment (100,000 yuan). However, it was put into production on July 1st and has already produced more than 20 kinds of products. Because the factory was active and proactive, it received support from the Luoyang Box-Making Factory and old factories near Lanzhou. Only more than 50,000 yuan of state investment was used, and the investment can be fully returned no later than the second quarter of next year. Workers continued production by hand-cranking during the repair of the paper cutter, and prepared to move production at any time according to production needs in the event of insufficient motors. The inspection team believed that this method of making do with whatever is available and producing while building is very good, and decided to increase some investment and build another paper mill to solve the raw materials for box making. The Lanzhou Quartz Powder Factory started preparations even later. After the establishment of the preparatory office on May 10th, the eight cadres, without waiting for the allocation of state investment, raised more than 1,000 yuan of savings and adopted the method of starting with indigenous methods first. They used the masses' stone mills and started producing quartz powder on July 1st. At the same time, they designed a pneumatic mill to replace manpower. All production activities were carried out under mat sheds. So far, no state funds have been spent, and seven tons of quartz powder have already been produced. It is planned to use only 500,000 yuan of investment, saving 700,000 yuan of state investment, and the factory with a planned annual output of 100,000 tons can be completed within the year. The inspection team believes that this is a manifestation of the communist style and an example of the correct implementation of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Many factories, mines, and capital construction units, inspired by the on-site evaluations, conveyed the spirit of the on-site meeting overnight and examined their own work.

    现场会上树立对立面
    甘肃运用抓两头带中间的方法鼓励先进鞭策落后
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委、中共兰州市委工业检查团充分运用抓两头带中间的方法，召开现场会，树立对立面，鼓励先进，鞭策落后，促进全市范围内基建和生产高潮。
    最近这个检查团带领各厂矿、基本建设单位的负责人和部分工人检查了兰州日用五金厂、兰州印刷制盒厂和兰州石粉厂，进行了现场评比。他们发现这三个工厂采取了两种方法，获得了两种结果。恰是贯彻社会主义建设总路线的一个鲜明的对照。
    兰州日用五金厂只不过是一个生产拉锁、大头针等小五金工厂，从4月23日开始筹建，历时3月，已经动用国家投资一万五千元进行建设，但是，至今厂房修缮尚未完工，机器设备还不能投入生产。当检查团来到厂内的时候，基建工人正在大事修缮职工宿舍等福利设施，把原来旧式门窗，铺上砖的，拆土围墙换砖围墙，仅修理大门，就使用两万青砖；生产车间尚未修好，有四部机器全部未开箱安装，他们却已经建立起俱乐部。造成这种现象的原因是政治没有挂帅，五金厂没有接受当地党委的领导，安宁区委又未打破办工业的神秘观点。负责支援新厂的兰州五金厂不是“下蛋”，只是“拔毛”，只抽调三个人就不再过问了；建设银行也放弃了对于使用国家投资的监督，任其挥霍。检查团发现上述这些问题，当场决定把原定二十五万元的投资交由区委负责，立即停止修缮宿舍，转入建厂房，安设备，限期改变落后面貌。
    检查团在兰州印刷制盒厂和兰州石英粉厂时，看到的完全是另一种面貌。兰州制盒厂在4月26日开始筹建，动手比五金厂迟，投资比五金厂少（十万元），反而在7月1日已经投入生产，制成二十多种产品。由于该厂积极主动，得到了洛阳制盒厂和兰州市附近老厂的支援，国家投资只使用了五万多元，至迟在明年二季度前即可将投资全部交还。工人们在裁纸机修理期间，采用手摇继续生产，在电动机不够的情况下准备按生产需要随时移动生产。检查团认为这种因陋就简、边建边生产的方法很好，决定增加一部分投资，再建一座造纸厂，解决制盒原料。兰州石英粉厂筹建开始更迟，在5月10日成立筹建处后，八个干部不等国家投资下拨，筹集积蓄一千多元，采取土法先上马的方针，利用群众石碾，从7月1日开始生产石英粉，同时设计风动磨，准备代替人力，全部生产活动在席棚下进行，至今未花国家分文，已经生产七吨石英粉，计划只使用五十万元投资，节约七十万元国家投资，即可在年内建成原计划年产量十万吨的工厂。检查团认为这是共产主义风格的表现，是正确执行“多快好省”的范例。许多厂矿和基建单位在现场评比的启示教育下，连夜传达现场会议精神，检查自己的工作。
