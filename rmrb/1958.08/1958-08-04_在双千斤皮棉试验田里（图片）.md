    In the Double-1000-Jin Ginned Cotton Experimental Field
    Henan Province, one of China's major cotton-producing areas, has seen particularly good cotton growth this year, with most plants currently flowering and bearing bolls. In Weixian Township, Fanrong No. 1 Cooperative, Junxian County, last year had two mu of high-yield fields producing 825 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This year, there is a 100-mu experimental field for high-yield ginned cotton yielding 2,000 jin per mu. Currently, the cotton plants have grown to three chi (approximately one meter) tall, with each plant bearing 20 to 30 cotton bolls. The photo shows cooperative members weeding in the 100-mu double-1000-jin ginned cotton experimental field.　Xinhua News Agency reporter Tang Maolin.

    在双千斤皮棉试验田里
    我国主要产棉区之一的河南省，今年棉花生长得特别好，大部分正在开花、结桃。浚县卫贤乡繁荣一社去年有二亩丰产田亩产皮棉八百二十五斤。今年有一百亩丰产皮棉两千斤的试验田，现在棉株已长到三尺高，每株结了棉桃二十到三十个。这是社员们正在百亩双千斤皮棉试验田里锄草。　新华社记者　唐茂林摄
