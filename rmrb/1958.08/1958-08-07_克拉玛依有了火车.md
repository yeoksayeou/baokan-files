Everywhere

    More than two hundred young shock workers in the Karamay mining area, after twelve days and nights of hard work, built a railway line 2,310 meters long on July 25. On the 26th, more than one hundred representatives attending the first Party Congress of the Karamay Mining Area boarded the first Hongqi No. 1 train and admired the railway. This railway is the first railway in the Karamay mining area and also the first railway in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
    This railway runs from the pipe station in the mining area to the equipment depot and can haul hundreds of tons of equipment at a time, saving an estimated more than twenty trucks on this section. At the same time, it speeds up the supply of equipment from the mining area to the various drilling rigs.

    克拉玛依有了火车
    克拉玛依矿区的二百多名青年突击队员们，经过十二个昼夜的苦战，在7月25日建成了一条长达二千三百一十公尺的铁路。26日，参加克拉玛依矿区首届党代会的一百多位代表，坐上了第一趟红旗一号列车，观赏了这条铁路。这条铁路是克拉玛依矿区的第一条铁路，也是新疆维吾尔自治区的第一条铁路。
    这条铁路从矿区的管子站起到器材库，一次能拖运上百吨的器材，估计在这段路上可节约二十多辆汽车。同时，还加快了矿区到各钻井上的器材供应。
