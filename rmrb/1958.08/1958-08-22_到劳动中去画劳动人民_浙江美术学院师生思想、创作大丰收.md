Xinhua News Agency Report: After rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the "double opposition" movement, Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts has reversed its long-standing closed-door approach to education. It has criticized aestheticism and revisionist bourgeois ideas in art teaching, and resolutely implemented the policy of combining literary and artistic education with labor and production, bringing about a completely new look to the school.

Based on confessing their thoughts to the Party and red-expert debates, all teachers and students of the four departments of Chinese Painting, Oil Painting, Printmaking, and Sculpture at Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts actively responded to the call of the Academy's Party Committee to go to the countryside to participate in labor training, combining propaganda and creation during labor. Since mid-April, nearly four hundred teachers and students have gone to the countryside in batches. During their two months in the countryside, in addition to labor, they also painted more than 92,000 single paintings, propaganda posters, murals, life sketches, and picture-story books, averaging 237.7 paintings per person, truly reflecting the new people and new events in the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.

In the countryside, teachers and students ate, lived, worked, and shared weal and woe with the peasants. Regardless of wind or rain, they went to work and labored together with the peasants. They quickly integrated with the masses in ideology and emotion, and established a deep friendship with the peasants. The peasants' enthusiasm for labor and revolutionary drive moved and educated the teachers and students who went to the countryside. They used breaks from field labor and various spare moments to paint portraits of model figures. They depicted the labor enthusiasm and heroic revolutionary spirit shown by the masses in accumulating fertilizer, transplanting rice seedlings, building water conservancy projects, and establishing factories into large-scale murals, propaganda posters, picture-story books, life sketches and other art works. These works, closely integrated with production and the lives of the masses, were deeply loved by the masses. Many peasants looked at the murals and propaganda posters on the walls every time they went in and out.

The teachers and students who went to the countryside this time said that in the past, when they went to the countryside to paint, they neither participated in labor nor engaged in propaganda and guidance. The things they painted back were not only small in quantity but also of very low quality. Some works were just a few landscape paintings, and the composition themes were mostly trivial matters of life such as "superfluous third parties" and "girls by the bridge." Moreover, it often took a year and a half to complete a creative draft. This time, among the more than 92,000 paintings painted by teachers and students in less than two months, there were more than 9,400 single creative paintings and propaganda posters alone. The forty-two graduating students in the fifth grade created more than 2,700 various forms of art works in two months, a number equal to thirty-five times the total number of paintings they had made in the past four years. And each creative sketch has a sense of the times. Many students felt after returning that the creative compositions they had conceived in the past were too incompatible with the new look of the countryside today, and they voluntarily abandoned or modified their original creative themes.

Teachers and students in the sculpture department have always believed that sculpture work cannot be good if it is done quickly, and quality cannot be guaranteed if there is too much. This time, the teachers and students of the fourth team of the sculpture department, who went to the countryside, overcame the difficulties in equipment and technology at the Gugguang Township Hydropower Station in Dongyang County, and made the first double worker-peasant alliance monument, as high as four meters, in the countryside in ten days. Teachers of the Chinese Painting Department, such as Zhu Lesan, Wu Fuzhi, and Huang Xi, also began to break with convention and used traditional Chinese painting techniques to express crops and modern figures.

### 到劳动中去画劳动人民  浙江美术学院师生思想、创作大丰收

　　到劳动中去画劳动人民
    浙江美术学院师生思想、创作大丰收
    据新华社讯  浙江美术学院经过整风、反右派斗争和双反运动后，扭转了长期以来关门提高的办学路线，批判了艺术教学上的唯美主义和修正主义的资产阶级思想，坚决贯彻文艺教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，使学校面貌焕然一新。
    浙江美术学院国画、油画、版画、雕塑等四个系的全体师生，在向党交心、红专辩论的基础上，积极响应学院党委下乡参加劳动锻炼，在劳动中边宣传、边创作的号召。从4月中旬起，近四百个教师和学生分批下乡。他们在下乡的二个月时间内，除了劳动以外，还画了九万二千多幅单幅画、宣传画、壁画、生活速写、连环画等美术作品，平均每人画了二百三十七点七张，真实地反映了工农业生产大跃进中的新人新事。
    师生们在农村中和农民同吃同住同劳动同甘苦，不论刮风或下雨，都和农民一起出工，一起劳动。他们很快就在思想上感情上和群众打成一片，同农民建立了深厚的友谊。群众的劳动热情和革命干劲，感动和教育了下乡的教师和学生，他们利用田间劳动休息和各种空隙时间为模范人物画像。他们把群众积肥、插秧、兴修水利、创办工厂中所表现出来的劳动积极性和豪迈的革命英雄主义气概，绘制成大幅壁画、宣传画、连环画、生活速写等美术作品。这种密切结合生产结合群众生活的作品，深受群众的喜爱。很多农民每天进出都要看一看墙上的壁画和宣传画。
    这次下乡的师生们说，过去下乡作画，一不参加劳动，二不搞宣传辅导，画回来的东西不仅数量少，而且质量也很低，有的作品只不过是几笔风景画，构图题材也大都是“多余的第三者”、“桥边的少女”等生活琐事，而且往往要一年半载才能完成一张创作稿。这次师生们在不到二个月的时间内所画的九万二千多幅画中，单是创作的单幅画和宣传画就有九千四百多幅。五年级应届毕业生四十二人在二个月内创作了二千七百多幅多种形式的美术作品，这个数字等于他们过去四年作画总数的三十五倍。而且每幅创作草图都具有时代气息。很多学生回来后感到自己过去所构思出来的创作构图和今天的农村新面貌太不调和，纷纷自动放弃或修改了原来的创作题材。
    雕塑系师生们一直认为雕塑工作快了就不能好，多了就不能保证质量。这次雕塑系组成的下乡第四小队的师生们，在东阳县古光乡水电站，克服了设备和技术上的困难，在十天内制出农村中第一个高达四公尺的双人工农联盟纪念碑。国画系教师诸乐三、吴茀之、黄羲等也开始打破常规，用国画传统技法来表现农作物和现代人物。（附图片）
