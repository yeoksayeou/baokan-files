　　Build Furnaces Quickly, Produce Iron Quickly
　　——Henan Daily Editorial, August 19th

　　Since the Provincial Party Committee's conference on the iron and steel industry, the people of the entire province have immediately launched a campaign to make great strides in the iron and steel industry. This movement has developed rapidly, with tremendous momentum and on a grand scale. All seven special districts and nine cities in the province are involved; in counties with resource conditions, almost every commune and production brigade has built iron smelting furnaces. As of August 15th, statistics show that more than 14,300 iron smelting furnaces and more than 1,200 steel converters and native furnaces have been built, producing more than 10,700 tons of iron and 1,011 tons of steel. The industrial production and construction of machinery, coal, geology, and coking have all achieved unprecedented results. A new upsurge in industrial construction, with steel as the key link, driving comprehensive industrial development, has truly formed throughout the province.

　　The brilliant achievements in trial smelting and furnace construction made by the whole Party and all the people in the great march towards the iron and steel industry prove that the Provincial Party Committee's policy of developing the iron and steel industry based on the General Line is correct. Once this policy is grasped by the masses, it immediately generates enormous and infinite power. First of all, due to the correct policy guidance, the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in running iron and steel were mobilized, creating unprecedented miracles, thereby breaking down the ideological obstacles such as skepticism, conditionalism, and mysticism held by some people in iron and steel production. Secondly, because the Party committees at all levels resolutely implemented this correct policy, breaking down departmentalism, they organized large-scale cooperation throughout the province, supporting and promoting each other in terms of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and technology, forming a new situation of large-scale iron and steel production. In addition, under the guidance of this correct policy, iron and steel production has made great achievements, further enhancing people's confidence in running iron and steel on a large scale and boosting their morale.

　　These achievements were made under the glorious illumination of the General Line and under the condition of further deepening the rectification movement centered on eliminating the influence of right-leaning opportunist ideas such as those of Pan Fusheng. This has laid the ideological, political, and material foundation for us to push iron and steel production to a new stage and fight a second battle well. In particular, the establishment of people's communes in rural and urban areas throughout the province will inevitably promote the development of the iron and steel industry.

　　At present, the iron and steel production in our province has entered a new stage, which is a new stage of building furnaces while organizing iron and steel production. This new situation presents us with many new tasks and many new problems and difficulties, both expected and unexpected, waiting for us to solve. The more prominent problem at present is that the speed of furnace construction is fast, but production cannot keep up. Of the more than 14,300 iron smelting furnaces that have been built, only more than 4,800 have been put into production. The speed of furnace construction in late July increased by 774.36% compared to mid-July, while the speed of production increased by only 221.51%. Therefore, the smelting equipment capacity has not been fully utilized, and the average daily output of each furnace in July was only 13 to 52 kilograms, which is only one-tenth of the normal output of ordinary native furnaces. The reasons for the above phenomenon are objectively many difficulties, such as insufficient raw materials and fuel in cities, and the supply of ore and coke has not been completely resolved; in rural areas, the main reason is that equipment and technology cannot keep up. However, the fact that many places pay attention to building furnaces (which is correct) but neglect to vigorously train smelting workers and improve smelting technology is also an important reason. They do not fully understand that the purpose of building furnaces is to produce more iron and steel, and that timely organization of production is the key to completing this year's iron and steel production task. At the same time, only by quickly producing iron and steel can we produce more smelting equipment and accelerate the speed of furnace construction. Conversely, if this problem is not resolved in time, it will not only affect the completion of the iron and steel production task, but also frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses for running iron and steel.

　　Of course, on the road of developing the iron and steel industry, we will encounter some new problems and difficulties. These specific problems are that the training of technical personnel, the allocation of labor, smelting equipment, mining of ore, fuel supply, and transportation have not been well resolved. Faced with these difficulties, we should not retreat in the face of difficulties and passively wait for help from the higher authorities. Instead, we should rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, and overcome all difficulties with an indomitable heroic spirit. However, at present, there are still some people who have incorrect ideas in the face of specific difficulties. They lack confidence in overcoming difficulties and are daunted by some technical problems and raw material problems, at a loss and hesitant. Often in such cases, erroneous ideas such as skepticism, conditionalism, and the tendency to reach out for help re-emerge and hinder the development of production. This situation must not be allowed to continue to develop. We must resolutely implement the Provincial Party Committee's correct policy of running iron and steel on a large scale, carry out debates, and continue to criticize and overcome the right-leaning conservative ideas that arise at any time.

　　The development of the situation requires us to build more furnaces and smelt more steel and iron at the highest speed and in the shortest time. Then, we must conduct further research on the progress and problems of the current iron and steel production and construction through specific accounting and problem ranking, so as to clarify the leading ideology, grasp the most important and prominent problems, and take active measures to solve them. In leading the iron and steel production movement, the Xinyang County Party Committee, in addition to putting politics in command and strengthening political and ideological work, their main characteristic is to analyze the situation in a timely manner, grasp the key to the current iron and steel production and construction, and study whether the thousands of iron smelting furnaces can be put into production in a timely manner after they are built, and whether the molten iron can flow out smoothly, and whether the production progress can be the same as the furnace construction speed. They believe that in order to put the already built native blast furnaces into production smoothly, we must rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, solve the problems of air blowing equipment, ore, fuel, and training a large number of technical personnel. In this way, they relied on and mobilized the people of the whole county to fight to solve these problems. When advanced experience and new inventions and creations were discovered, they immediately convened on-site meetings to learn and promote them. In less than a month, they convened seven on-site meetings to solve a series of difficulties and problems. Therefore, their iron and steel production progress has advanced by leaps and bounds. The iron and steel production movement in Kaifeng City has also actively taken measures from the trial smelting stage, relying on self-reliance, solved the problems of technology, equipment, and raw materials, and entered a new stage of mass production.

　　In order to push the upsurge of iron and steel production and construction to a new stage, we must continue to focus on furnace construction in the future, and complete the furnace construction task at a higher speed than in the past. At present, there are still many areas where more furnaces should be built, but not many have actually been built, and there is an imbalance. According to the production capacity of the already built native blast furnaces and simple small blast furnaces, as well as small blast furnaces of more than eight cubic meters, it is far from meeting the needs of the iron and steel production task. Therefore, tens of thousands more native blast furnaces must continue to be built in the shortest possible time and put into production quickly. While grasping the furnace construction work, Party committees at all levels should grasp the smelting work, rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, actively take effective measures to solve the technical problems of furnace construction and smelting, as well as a series of problems such as raw materials, refractory materials, ore, fuel, and various equipment required for furnace construction and smelting, and try every means to do a good job in production preparation.

　　Building furnaces and production are carried out simultaneously, which requires leaders to personally participate, go deep into key points, summarize the advanced experience of smelting and furnace construction, as well as the experience of prospecting, mining, manufacturing equipment, fuel, transportation, etc., and convene on-site meetings and symposiums in a timely manner to organize promotion, so that one family creates and hundreds of families develop, and the key problems of furnace construction and smelting are quickly resolved. At the same time, it is also necessary to continue to train a large number of technical personnel, hold various types of professional training classes, and adopt various forms to carry out crash training in a rapid way, so as to complete the iron and steel production and construction tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

　　In order to conscientiously implement the Party's General Line for building socialism, we must resolutely implement our province's correct policy of developing the iron and steel industry. Party committees at all levels must summarize the experience of the previous stage of iron and steel industry development in the spirit of the General Line, and further promote the upsurge of iron and steel production and construction.

　　Striving to complete the task at a high speed is an important sign of measuring the quality of all production and construction work, especially the large-scale iron and steel production cannot be an exception. Let us strive for building furnaces quickly and producing iron and steel quickly!

　　快建炉  快产铁
　　——河南日报八月十九日社论
    自省委钢铁工业会议以后，全省人民立即展开了向钢铁工业大进军的运动。这个运动发展神速，声势浩大，规模壮阔。全省七个专区、九个市无空白，有资源条件的县，乡乡社社几乎都建立起炼铁炉。截至8月15日统计，已建成炼铁炉一万四千三百多座，炼钢转炉和土炉一千二百多座，产铁一万零七百多吨，炼钢一千零一十一吨。机械、煤炭、地质、炼焦等工业生产建设，都取得了空前未有的成绩。真正是在全省范围内形成了一个以钢为纲，带动工业全面发展的工业建设的新高潮。
    全党全民向钢铁工业大进军，在试炼和建炉上取得的辉煌成就，证明了省委根据总路线提出的发展钢铁工业的方针是正确的。这个方针一经为群众所掌握，就立即产生了巨大无穷的力量。首先，由于在正确的方针指导下调动了人民群众大办钢铁的积极性和创造性，作出了空前未有的奇迹，从而打破了某些人在钢铁生产中所持的怀疑论、条件论、神秘论等思想障碍。其次，由于各级党委坚决贯彻执行了这一正确方针，打破了本位主义思想，在全省范围内，分区组织了大协作，在人力物力财力技术方面，互相支援，互相促进，形成大办钢铁的新局面。另外，在这一正确方针指导下，钢铁生产作出了很大成绩，进一步增强了人们大办钢铁的信心，鼓舞了人们的干劲。
    这些成绩，是在总路线的光辉照耀下取得的，是在以肃清潘复生等右倾机会主义思想影响为中心的整风运动进一步深入开展的情况下取得的。这就为我们把钢铁生产推向新的阶段，打好第二个战役奠定了思想政治基础与物质基础。特别是全省农村、城市人民公社的建立，必然会促进钢铁工业的发展。
    目前，我省钢铁生产已进入一个新的阶段，这就是一边继续建炉，一边又要组织钢铁生产的新阶段。这种新的形势，给我们提出了许多新的任务，出现许多过去曾预料或者没有预料到的新的问题和困难，等待我们解决。目前比较突出的问题，就是建炉进度快，生产跟不上，建成的一万四千多座炼铁炉，投入生产的只有四千八百多座。7月下旬较中旬建炉速度增长774.36％，而生产速度仅增长221.51％，因而冶炼设备能力没有充分利用，每个炉子7月份平均日产十三到五十二公斤，仅及一般土炉正常产量的十分之一。造成上述现象的原因，在客观上是有许多困难的，如在城市主要是原料、燃料不足，矿石与焦炭供应没有完全解决；在农村主要是设备与技术跟不上。但是，不少地方注意建炉（这是对的），忽视大力培养冶炼工人，提高冶炼技术，也是重要原因之一。他们不完全了解，建炉的目的是为了生产更多的钢铁，及时组织生产，则是完成今年钢铁生产任务的关键。同时，只有很快生产出钢铁，才能更多的生产冶炼设备，加速建炉速度。反之，这一问题如不及时解决，不仅影响钢铁生产任务的完成，而且会使群众办钢铁的热情受到挫折。
    当然，在发展钢铁工业的前进道路上，是会遇到一些新的问题和困难的，这些具体问题，主要是技术力量的培训、劳动力的调配、冶炼设备、开采矿石、燃料供应、交通运输等问题还未能很好的解决。对待这些困难，我们不应当知难而退，消极等待上级帮助解决。而应当依靠群众，自力更生，以坚韧不拔的英雄气概，战胜一切困难。但是，目前仍然有一部分人在具体困难面前有不正确的想法，他们对于克服困难信心不足，被一些技术上的问题，原料问题所吓倒，束手无策，犹豫不决。往往就在这样的情况下，怀疑论、唯条件论，以及伸手派等阻碍发展生产的错误思想重新滋长起来。这种情况决不能让其继续发展下去。要坚决贯彻省委大办钢铁的正确方针，开展辩论，继续批判和克服随时所产生的右倾保守思想。
    形势的发展要求我们，以最高的速度、在最短的时间，建更多的炉，炼更多的钢和铁。那末，我们就要通过具体算帐和问题站队，对当前钢铁生产建设的进度和问题，作进一步的研究，使领导思想清醒，抓住最主要最突出的问题，采取积极措施予以解决。信阳县委在对钢铁生产运动的领导上，除了政治挂帅，加强政治思想工作之外，他们最主要的特点就是及时的分析情况，抓住了当前钢铁生产建设中的关键，研究了成千的炼铁炉建成后能否及时投入生产，并顺利的流出铁水，生产进度能不能和建炉速度一样的问题。他们认为要使已经建成的土高炉顺利的投入生产，必须依靠群众，自力更生，解决鼓风设备、矿石、燃料及培训大批的技术力量。就这样依靠和发动全县人民为解决这些问题而进行斗争。发现了先进经验与新的发明创造，立即召开现场会议学习推广，不到一个月，他们先后召开了七次现场会议，解决了一系列的困难和问题。因而他们钢铁生产进度突飞猛进。开封市的钢铁生产运动，也由试炼阶段，积极采取措施，依靠自力更生，解决了技术、设备和原料问题，转入大量生产的新阶段。
    为了把钢铁生产建设高潮推向新的阶段，今后必须继续抓好建炉工作，用比过去更高的速度完成建炉任务。目前还有不少地区应该多建炉，而实际建成的却不多，存在不平衡的现象。根据已经建成的土高炉和简易小高炉，以及八立方公尺以上的小高炉，其生产能力，还远不能满足钢铁生产任务的需要，因此，必须在最短时间内，继续建成几万座以上的土高炉，并迅速投入生产。各级党委在抓好建炉工作的同时，抓好冶炼工作，依靠群众，自力更生，积极采取有效措施，解决好建炉、冶炼的技术问题，以及建炉与冶炼所需原料、耐火材料、矿石、燃料及各种设备等一系列的问题，并想尽一切办法作好生产准备工作。
    建炉与生产同时并举，需要领导亲自动手，深入重点，总结冶炼、建炉的先进经验，以及探矿、采矿、制造设备、燃料、运输等各方面的经验，及时召开现场会、座谈会组织推广，要作到一家创造百家发展，使建炉与冶炼等生产关键问题迅速解决。与此同时，还需要继续大量的培养技术力量，举办各种类型专业性的训练班，采取多种形式，以速成的办法突击训练，多快好省地完成钢铁生产建设任务。
    为了认真贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，必须坚决执行我省发展钢铁工业的正确方针，各级党委要以总路线的精神，总结前一段钢铁工业发展的经验，进一步推动钢铁生产建设高潮。
    力争高速度地完成任务，是衡量一切生产建设工作好坏的重要标志，特别是大办钢铁更不能例外。让我们为快建炉、快生产钢铁而奋斗！
