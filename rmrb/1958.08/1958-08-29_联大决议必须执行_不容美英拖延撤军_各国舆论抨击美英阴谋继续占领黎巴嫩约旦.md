Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 27th. Cairo Radio today attacked the United States and Britain for "plotting systematically" to continue the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan.

The commentator cited many facts to prove that the United States and Britain do not intend to withdraw their aggressive troops from these two Middle Eastern countries. The commentator said that just as Lebanese opposition leaders were holding meetings demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of American troops, American troops were carrying out new deployments in Beirut. As for Britain's intentions, its official spokesman has stated that it is too early to predict the date of the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

The commentator pointed out that the fact that the United States is keeping Chamoun in office also reveals the true purpose of the United States is to continue occupying Lebanon. People are asking, is imperialism keeping Chamoun around to play a new role in preventing American troops from withdrawing from Lebanon, just as he did when he "requested" American troops to occupy Lebanon?

The commentator warned the aggressor countries that they should understand that any attempt to obstruct the immediate withdrawal of troops from the Middle East will only facilitate the outbreak of the situation in the entire region.

The radio station pointed out that the task of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the responsibility of the United Nations should not be to serve the aggressors and reward them, should not be to attach conditions to their withdrawal, should not be to force the so-called "mandatory neutrality" of the West, and should not be to preserve corrupt regimes against the will of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th. TASS, Moscow, August 27th: The Soviet "Red Star" published a commentary criticizing the U.S.-British aggressive bloc's attempt to delay the implementation of the UN General Assembly's emergency special session resolution on the early withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The newspaper wrote that U.S. and British imperialists are using various excuses to try to extend their occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. This intensifies the situation in the Near and Middle East and threatens to ease the situation in the Near and Middle East again. The newspaper pointed out that as long as U.S. and British troops are stationed in Lebanon and Jordan, the danger of the intensification and expansion of military conflicts in the Near and Middle East cannot be considered to have been eliminated.

"Red Star" concluded by saying that the people of all countries are vigilantly watching the actions of the U.S.-British aggressive bloc. They demand the immediate implementation of the UN resolution and demand that the intervention troops get out of Lebanon and Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, London, August 28th. The British youth magazine "Challenge" demands that British troops withdraw from the Middle East.

The September issue of "Challenge" magazine said in an editorial written by Tony Winslow, secretary of the London Communist Youth League: "For more than forty years, Conservative governments have carried out various conspiracies in the Middle East, dividing the Middle East, selling out some parts of the Middle East, occupying the Middle East, creating - and dividing - some kingdoms, all to achieve their goals and increase their profits.

"To cover up their true interests and activities, they talk glibly about 'protecting', 'helping' and saving the Arabs.

"In fact, the Conservatives have done nothing to help the Arabs, but they have done many things to help themselves and their class. For example, in Iraq, shareholders of the (British) Iraq Petroleum Company have earned a profit of 108 million pounds in just two years.

"The Conservatives continue to occupy Cyprus and incite armed conflict between Greeks and Turks in order to divide and rule. They do this in the hope of maintaining the island as a British base for attacking the Arabs.

"Every action they take deepens the Arabs' hatred of Britain and harms the true interests of the British people for the sake of oil profits."

The editorial said: "The Conservatives must be stopped" and "our troops must be withdrawn from Jordan," and "the Arab people's right to self-determination" must be recognized.

This week's "World News" argued in an editorial for more pressure on the U.S. and Britain to force them to withdraw their troops from the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. New York News: A "Wall Street Journal" article published on the 25th argued that it would be difficult to explain to world public opinion if the United States troops did not withdraw from Lebanon soon.

The article pointed out that since the United States also voted in the United Nations in favor of the Arab countries' proposal, "it seems that it has no other choice but to begin withdrawing its troops."

The article wrote: "If we don't do this, then our situation will indeed be very bad. Because we will actually be saying that our original explanation for intervening was not our real reason." "If the recognition of the Iraqi government, the completion of the (new president's) election in Lebanon, and the UN decision are not enough for us to withdraw, then what kind of conditions should we propose for withdrawal?"

### 联大决议必须执行　不容美英拖延撤军  各国舆论抨击美英阴谋继续占领黎巴嫩约旦

　　联大决议必须执行　不容美英拖延撤军
    各国舆论抨击美英阴谋继续占领黎巴嫩约旦
    新华社开罗27日电　开罗电台今天抨击美国和英国“有计划地阴谋”继续占领黎巴嫩和约旦。
    这位评论员引述许多事实，证明美国和英国不打算从这两个中东国家撤出它们的侵略军队。评论员说，正当黎巴嫩反对派领袖举行会议要求美国军队立即无条件撤退的时候，美国军队却在贝鲁特进行了新的调动。至于英国的意图，它的官方发言人已经说明，现在要预言英国军队撤出约旦的日期是为时过早的。
    评论员指出，美国使夏蒙继续留任这一事实也揭露出美国的真正目的是继续占领黎巴嫩。人们在问，帝国主义把夏蒙保留下来，是不是要他扮演新的角色来使美国侵略军不撤出黎巴嫩，正如他在“请求”美国军队占领黎巴嫩时所干的那样呢？
    评论员警告各侵略国家说，它们应该明白，阻挠从中东立即撤军的任何尝试，只会促成整个地区局势的爆发。
    这家电台指出，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的任务和联合国的责任不应该是为侵略者效劳和给他们以报偿，不应该是为他们撤军加上条件，不应该是强迫实行西方所谓的“强制性中立”，也不应该是违背人民的意志来保存腐败的政权。
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联“红星报”发表评论，评美英侵略集团企图拖延执行联大紧急特别会议关于美英军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议。
    报纸写道，美英帝国主义者正在利用各种借口企图延长对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵占。这使中近东局势尖锐化，使中近东地区缓和下来的局势又受到威胁。报纸指出，只要美英军队驻在黎巴嫩和约旦，中近东地区军事冲突的加剧和扩大的危险性就不能够认为已经消除。
    “红星报”最后说，各国人民警惕地注视着美英侵略集团的行动。他们要求立即实现联大决议，并要求干涉军滚出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    新华社伦敦28日电　英国的青年杂志“挑战”要求英国军队撤出中东。
    9月号的“挑战”杂志在伦敦共产主义青年团书记托尼·温斯娄所写的社论中说：“四十多年来，保守党政府在中东进行了种种阴谋活动，分裂中东，出卖中东一些地方，占领中东，制造——并且分裂——一些王国，所有这一切都是为了达到他们的目的和增加他们的利润。
    “为了掩盖他们的真正利益和活动，他们就侈谈‘保护’、‘帮助’和拯救阿拉伯人。
    “事实上，保守党人没有做什么事情来帮助阿拉伯人，但是他们却做许多事情来帮助自己和他们的阶级。例如在伊拉克，在仅仅两年内就为（英国的）伊拉克石油公司的股东赚到了一亿零八百万英镑的利润。
    “保守党人继续占领塞浦路斯、并且煽动希腊人和土耳其人之间的武力冲突，以便分而治之。他们这样做是希望保持这个岛屿作为英国进攻阿拉伯人的基地。
    “他们所采取的每一个行动，都在加深阿拉伯人对英国的仇恨，都在为了石油利润的缘故而损害英国人民的真正利益。”
    这篇社论说：“必须制止保守党人”，并且“把我们的军队从约旦调回国”，必须“承认阿拉伯人民的自决权。”
    本周的“世界新闻”在社论中主张对美英施加更多的压力以迫使它们把军队撤出中东。
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：“华尔街日报”25日发表的一篇文章，认为美国军队如不早日撤出黎巴嫩，将难以向全世界舆论交代。
    文章指出，美国既然也在联合国中投票赞成阿拉伯国家提案，“那么它除了开始撤退它的军队之外似乎没有任何别的选择了。”
    文章写道：“如果我们不这样作的话，那么我们的处境的确会很糟糕。因为我们实际上将是等于说，我们原来对进行干涉所作的解释并不是我们真正的理由。”“如果承认了伊拉克政府、完成了黎巴嫩（新总统的）选举，再加上联合国的决定还不足以使我们撤离的话，那么我们应该提出怎么样撤退的条件呢？”
