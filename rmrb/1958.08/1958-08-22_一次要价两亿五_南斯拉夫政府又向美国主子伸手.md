Xinhua News Agency, August 21st dispatch from Washington: The Yugoslav ruling clique has recently reached out to the United States again, begging for $250 million in "aid."

According to State Department Press Officer Joseph Reap's announcement on the 19th, three weeks ago, Yugoslavia submitted a "detailed list" requesting "aid" to the United States. He said that some of the items on the list "have been previously submitted to the United States, and some are new." According to the U.S. News Service quoting a State Department spokesperson, the total amount of "aid" requested by Yugoslavia is approximately $250 million.

According to the Associated Press, "The U.S. State Department is giving sympathetic consideration to Yugoslavia's request, and there are indications that some loans will be provided soon." The report revealed that senior U.S. officials "are estimating the necessity of supporting Yugoslavia's independence" in order to continue its confrontation with the international communist movement. The news also quoted Washington officials as saying that the State Department has "quietly permitted Yugoslavia to purchase parts and replacement equipment for American weapons."

It is reported that in the last fiscal year ending June 30 of this year, the United States provided another $103 million in economic "aid" to the Tito group, including "surplus" wheat worth approximately $73 million.

According to a report in the London "Daily Telegraph" on the 19th, while begging the United States for "aid," the Yugoslav ruling clique made similar requests to countries such as Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany without going through diplomatic channels. A dispatch from London by Agence France-Presse on the same day indicated that the British Foreign Office is studying Yugoslavia's request for long-term loans.

　　一次要价两亿五
    南斯拉夫政府又向美国主子伸手
    新华社21日讯  华盛顿消息：南斯拉夫统治集团最近又伸手向美国乞讨二亿五千万美元的“援助”。
    据国务院新闻发布官约瑟夫·里普19日宣布，三个星期以前，南斯拉夫向美国提出了一项要求“援助”的“详细清单”。他说，清单中的项目“有些过去已经向美国提出过，有些是新的”。据美国新闻处引国务院发言人的估计，南斯拉夫要求“援助”的总数为二亿五千万美元左右。
    据美联社的消息说，“美国国务院对南斯拉夫的要求正在给予同情的考虑，并且有迹象表明，不久就会提供一些贷款”。消息透露，美国的高级官员“正在估计支持南斯拉夫独立的必要性”，以便使它同国际共产主义运动继续对抗。这条消息还引华盛顿官员们的话说，国务院已经“悄悄地准许南斯拉夫购买美国武器的零件和替换装备”。
    据报道，在截至今年6月30日为止的上一财政年度中，美国向铁托集团提供了又一笔一亿零三百万美元的经济“援助”，其中“剩余”小麦大约值七千三百万美元。
    据伦敦“每日电讯报”19日报道，在向美国乞讨“援助”的同时，南斯拉夫统治集团不通过外交途径向英、法、意、西德等国提出了类似的请求。同一天法新社从伦敦发出的消息表明，英国外交部正在研究南斯拉夫乞讨长期贷款的请求。
