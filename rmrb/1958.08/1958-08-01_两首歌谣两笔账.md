Two Ballads, Two Accounts
Su Wei

"The wind blows to the old countryside, sand and stones fly like waves, the surrounding sand and soil are like hills, it's heartbreaking to pass through here, cars are unwilling to come, horse carts are unwilling to go, we worry terribly during the fertilizer transport season." This is a ballad that has been circulating among the farmers in the old countryside area of Gaotang County, Shandong Province, for many years. This township is located in a sandy area, making movement very inconvenient. Coupled with backward transportation tools, traffic is particularly difficult. Whenever it's time to transport fertilizer to the fields, the farmers start to worry. Therefore, either the manure cannot be delivered to the fields, or they simply accumulate less fertilizer, so the crops never grow well. After the Great Leap Forward, this township changed its habit of not accumulating or accumulating little fertilizer, and accumulated eight billion catties of fertilizer. But how to transport such a large amount of fertilizer to the fields? Relying on the backward four-wheeled carts that have been passed down for thousands of years? The township Party committee calculated an account: it would take 5,580 laborers 215 days to complete. How could this work! Laborers can't all go to transport fertilizer; many other farm works also require a large amount of labor. Even if they all went to transport fertilizer, it could not guarantee timely fertilization and not delaying the farming season!

This was the situation before July 15th. Only ten and a half days have passed, and the situation has fundamentally changed. The farmers in the old countryside are singing new ballads. Listen, how joyful the singing is!

"The millennium iron tree has blossomed, the old town folks are laughing, tools must also undergo a great change, the entire township has realized bearingization, liberating thousands upon thousands of laborers, production plans can be well realized." In the past, the fertilizer transport plan in the old countryside had never been completed. From July 24th to 28th, this township launched a 50,000-catty supplementary fertilization campaign. Although the plan was much larger than in the past, it was completed as scheduled. At this time, the township Party committee calculated another account: for the task of transporting eight billion catties of fertilizer alone, it saved 960,000 labor days.

Isn't the matter already very clear? Promoting improved tools and bearingizing all rotating tools can not only solve the problem of labor shortage, but also liberate people from heavy physical labor, turning "worrying terribly" into "laughing happily." Such a great thing that is beneficial to production and beneficial to the masses has attracted the attention and importance of many places. A movement to reform agricultural tools centered on the bearingization of rotating tools has been vigorously launched. However, there are still some places where there is no movement or it is lukewarm. The leading comrades in these places have not yet put their main strength on reforming agricultural tools. Their reason is: at present, it is a critical moment to strive for a great harvest for the whole year, early rice needs to be harvested, autumn crops need to be weeded, topdressing is needed, and drought and flood prevention are needed, and... In short, they are very busy, "How can there be time to engage in agricultural tool reform?" This view is wrong; they only see the phenomenon of things, but not the essence of things.

Why are they too busy? The increase in work after the Great Leap Forward is a reason, but it is not the main reason, let alone the fundamental reason. The fundamental reason is still low labor efficiency. A person who can do ten things a day does not feel that it is too much or too busy when encountering ten things; a person who can only do one thing a day feels that it is too much and too busy when encountering two things to do. Isn't this principle very simple? And what does it take to improve labor efficiency? It depends on reforming tools and developing productivity. Because rotating tools account for a large proportion of all agricultural production tools, improving rotating tools and improving the efficiency of rotating tools, and adding ball bearings to all rotating tools, has become the central link in the reform of tools. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us: the purpose of revolution is to thoroughly liberate and greatly develop social productive forces. Applying this fundamental principle specifically to today means promoting improved agricultural tools and realizing the bearingization of rotating tools. Failing to grasp this central link will not only fail to handle the matter of striving for a great harvest for the whole year well, but it can be asserted that the more "busy" they are, the worse they will handle it. It is precisely in order to strive for a great harvest for the whole year that we must vigorously engage in improving agricultural tools and vigorously engage in the bearingization of rotating tools.

    两首歌谣两笔账
    苏蔚
    “大风吹到旧城乡，飞沙走石像波浪，周围沙土像丘岭，路过此地伤心肠，汽车不愿来，马车不愿往，运肥季节愁的慌。”这是山东省高唐县旧城乡地方的农民中流传了多少年的一首歌谣。这个乡处在沙窝地带，行动已是十分不便，再加上运输工具落后，交通就显得分外艰难了。每逢向田里运送肥料时，农民就发起愁来。因此，不是有粪送不到地里，就是干脆少积肥，所以庄稼总是长不好。大跃进后，这个乡改变了不积肥少积肥的习惯，积肥八十亿斤。但怎么把这样大量的肥料运到田里去呢？依靠几千年流传下来的落后的四轮车吗？乡党委算了一笔账：五千五百八十个劳动力，二百一十五天才能完成。这怎么能行！劳动力不能全去运送肥料，许多别的农活也还需要大量的劳力。就算都去运肥，也不能保证及时施肥和不误农时呀！
    这是7月15日以前的情形。时间只过了十天半月，情况就根本改变了。旧城乡的农民唱起了新歌谣，你听，这歌声多么欢乐！
    “千年铁树开了花，旧城群众笑哈哈，工具也要大翻身，全乡实现轴承化，解放劳力千千万，生产计划好实现。”过去，旧城乡的运肥计划从来没有完成过，7月24日到28日这个乡开展了个补施追肥五万斤运动，计划虽然比过去大了许多，然而却如期完成了。这时乡党委又算了一笔账：只运肥八十亿斤这一项工作，就节省了九十六万个劳动日。
    事情不是已经十分清楚了吗？推广改良工具，把一切运转的工具滚珠轴承化，不仅可以解决劳动力不足的问题，还能够把人从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，使“愁的慌”变成“笑哈哈”。这样一件对生产有利，对群众有利的大好事，引起了很多地方的注意和重视，一个以实现运转工具滚珠轴承化为中心的改革农具运动已经猛烈地开展起来。但仍然有一些地方没有动静或冷冷落落，这些地方的领导同志直到今天还没有把自己的主要力量放在改革农具方面来。他们的理由是：目前正是争取全年大丰收的关键时刻，早稻要收割，大秋作物要锄草，要追肥，要防旱抗涝，要……总之是忙得很，“哪有工夫搞农具改革？”这种观点是错误的，只看见了事物的现象，没有看到事物的本质。
    为什么忙不过来？大跃进以后事情多了，是个原因，但不是主要原因，更不是根本原因。根本原因还是劳动效率低。一天能作十件事的人，碰见十件事并不觉其多，也不显其忙；一个一天只能作一件事的人，碰见两件事要办，就觉得既多也忙了。这道理不是十分简单吗？而提高劳动效率靠什么呢？靠改革工具，发展生产力。因为运转工具在全部的农业生产工具中占着很大的比重，改良运转工具，提高运转工具的效能，把一切运转工具都加上滚珠轴承，就又成了改革工具中的中心环节了。党中央和毛主席一再教导我们：革命的目的就是为了彻底解放和极大发展社会生产力。这个根本的道理具体运用到今天，就是推广改良农具，实现运转工具滚珠轴承化。抓不住这个中心环节，不仅不会把争取全年大丰收的事情忙好，可以肯定会越“忙”越忙不好。正是为了争取全年大丰收，才更要大搞改良农具，大搞运转工具滚珠轴承化。
