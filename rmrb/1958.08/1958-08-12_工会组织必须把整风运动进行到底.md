The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its Second Meeting of the Eighth Executive Committee on August 6th. The meeting determined the current tasks of trade union work, re-elected the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, added Vice-Chairmen, re-elected members of the Presidium, and adjusted the composition of the Secretariat. This was a meeting of great significance for trade union work.

This meeting was convened on the basis of major victories in the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and amidst the high tide of the nationwide surge of communist spirit, as the people of the whole country were exerting great effort to implement the Party's general line for building socialism. The purpose of this meeting was to determine how to continue deepening the rectification movement in trade union organizations and to carry the rectification through to the end, so that through rectification, the trade union cadres' ideological and work-related errors of trade unionism and economism could be thoroughly overcome. This would ensure that trade union organizations at all levels, politically, organizationally, and in their work, were completely under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, further mobilizing, educating, and organizing the broad masses of workers to implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; and better exert the active role of trade union organizations in the all-people ideological and production leap forward. Therefore, the various issues addressed at this meeting were resolved relatively smoothly and practically. The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle are socialist revolutions on the ideological and political fronts in our country, and they are struggles of decisive significance concerning the socialist and capitalist roads. At the same time, they are also the key to driving all work, bringing about a great liberation of communist thought, promoting a nationwide upsurge in production and construction, and bringing a new atmosphere to trade union work.

Since the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, a number of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist rightist elements have been purged from trade union organizations. Although the number of these reactionary elements is not large, their harm is great. They are not reconciled to the victory of the socialist revolution led by the Party and are doing everything possible to undermine the socialist revolution and socialist construction led by the Party. However, given the current situation of the rapid development of socialist cause in our country, the general trend, and the will of the people, they do not dare to directly oppose the Party and socialism. They pretend to be revolutionaries, but in reality, they are engaging in shameful counter-revolutionary activities. Rightist elements in trade union organizations often masquerade as "concerned about the interests of workers," exaggerating themselves as "experts" in trade union work, slandering the Party for not caring about the interests of workers, not understanding trade union work, and undermining the Party's prestige and the relationship between the Party and the masses of workers. And some of our trade union cadres, due to guild concepts and trade unionist and economistic ideological sentiments, are unable to see through the true face of the rightist elements, unable to wage a resolute struggle against them, and are even utilized by them. Therefore, striving to improve the level of class consciousness, improving the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, overcoming various erroneous ideas, and holding high the red flag of the proletariat are important conditions for severely combating the reactionary words and deeds of rightist elements and expelling them from trade union organizations. And expelling rightist elements from trade union organizations is a victory for the cause of the Party, a victory for socialism, a victory for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and a victory for clearing away dangerous enemies hindering the progress of trade union work.

During the rectification movement, through the adoption of methods of extensive airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, and the unreserved launch of criticism and self-criticism of errors and shortcomings in our work, trade union cadres' trade unionism deviating from the leadership of the Party, economism deviating from politics, and varying degrees of individualism and liberalism not being of one heart with the Party have been greatly corrected. The relationship between the trade union and the masses of workers under the leadership of the Party has become closer, and many trade union cadres do indeed have a new attitude, working with a cheerful mood and great effort. This is a gratifying new atmosphere.

However, can it be said that all trade union organizations and every trade union cadre has achieved this? This cannot be said. Taking the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as an example, during the vigorous rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle last year, Chen Yongwen, the former president of the Workers' Daily and an anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist rightist element, was safe and sound. Only after the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, after studying the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and Chairman Mao's speech at this session, liberating thought, raising the red flag, polishing the eyes, and improving understanding, and when the rectification movement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was further deepened, was the true face of Chen Yongwen, this rightist element, fully exposed. This is just as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, "The rectification movement that began in May of last year has now achieved great success. But if we are complacent about the achievements we have already made and think that everything is fine, that would be completely wrong. We must see that the development of the movement is uneven. In some units, some places, and among some people, the rectification movement has not been carried out deeply or thoroughly. In individual units, bureaucratism, commandism, sectarianism, and subjectivism have not been shaken, and even occupied by rightist elements or bad elements, and the enthusiasm of the masses is still suppressed." The recent further deepening of rectification by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions proves the correctness of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's assessment. Does this situation revealed in the in-depth rectification of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions only exist in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, while the rectification of trade union organizations in all parts of the country has been carried out deeply and thoroughly? Is it only that the rectification of the Workers' Daily in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is not deep or thorough, while other units have all been carried out deeply and thoroughly? This cannot be seen in this way. It would be wrong to think so.

The further deepening of the rectification movement in trade unions has exposed the fact that some cadres' thinking still contains trade unionism that deviates from the leadership of the Party and economism that deviates from politics; some have even developed to the point of trying to be different, setting up their own mountain strongholds, doing their own thing, and confronting the Party in an intolerable manner. They have already walked to the edge of rightist elements opposing the Party and socialism. And this serious situation was not given due criticism in the early stages of the rectification, but was only exposed and thoroughly liquidated when the rectification movement was further deepened.

Many trade union cadres also still have guild concepts that reflect the thinking of backward workers, not proceeding from the overall situation, only caring about immediate interests and not long-term interests, only caring about work and not asking about politics, and narrow economistic thinking. And these are precisely the reflections of the erroneous ideological thoughts of individualism and liberalism that exist to varying degrees in some trade union cadres. People with this kind of thinking and style are precisely the targets of rightist elements; this kind of thinking and style is also the soil for bourgeois individualistic careerists. Individualism is the enemy of communism. Tolerance of individualism cannot raise the red flag of communism. Peaceful coexistence with individualism is to condone the capitalist attack on communism. We must thoroughly overcome individualistic thinking in order to thoroughly improve the style of trade union cadres, be completely of one heart with the Party, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, integrate with the masses, and effectively complete the Party's political tasks and central work. And in order to overcome the various errors in the thinking of trade union cadres, we must deepen the rectification movement and carry it through to the end.

At present, our country is in an era of great liberation of communist thought, a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and one day equaling twenty years. If trade union work is not to fall behind the masses or the movement, it must thoroughly overcome the erroneous thoughts and words of some trade union cadres, so that in such a great era, trade union work can promote the advancement of the movement with the spirit of continuous revolution. The key here is to deepen the rectification movement and carry it through to the end. At present, continuing to deepen the rectification in trade union organizations is an extremely important political task for the trade union.

The task of rectification of trade union organizations is to make the trade union completely under the leadership of the Party and overcome all tendencies to deviate from the leadership of the Party; it is to establish an overall viewpoint, a viewpoint of proceeding from 600 million people, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance; overcome the phenomenon of splitting the unity of the working class and splitting the unity of the people of the whole country; it is to put politics in command, strengthen political and ideological work, overcome guild thinking and narrow economistic thinking, and make trade union organizations truly become mass organizations of the working class with a distinct Party character, so that trade union work can truly play an active role in socialist construction.

In the rectification, rightist elements must be resolutely expelled from trade union organizations; those who have made mistakes and have ideological problems should be seriously criticized, treated differently, and the principle of "strict in ideological criticism, lenient in handling" should be implemented, so as to achieve the purpose of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the illness to save the patient" and "clarifying thinking and uniting comrades."

At present, all aspects of the socialist construction cause are in a great leap forward. This is the result of the victorious development of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and it is also the result of implementing the Party's general line. Trade union organizations must deepen rectification, and never stop until complete victory is achieved. Only in this way can we accurately implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and can trade union organizations play their due role in the cause of socialist construction.

### 工会组织必须把整风运动进行到底

　　工会组织必须把整风运动进行到底
    中华全国总工会于8月6日召开了第八届执行委员会第二次会议，确定了当前工会工作的任务，补选了全国总工会主席和增选了副主席，补选了主席团委员，调整了书记处的人选，这是对工会工作具有重要意义的一次会议。
    这次会议是在整风运动和反右派斗争获得重大胜利的基础上，是在全国人民共产主义精神大高涨，鼓足干劲为实现党的建设社会主义总路线的高潮下召开的。这次会议的目的，就是确定在工会组织中继续深入整风运动，把整风进行到底，以便通过整风彻底克服工会干部思想上、工作上的工团主义、经济主义错误，使各级工会组织，在政治上、组织上和业务工作上完全在各级党委领导下，进一步发动、教育和组织广大职工群众贯彻党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线；更好地发挥工会组织在全民思想、生产大跃进中的积极作用。所以这次会议，解决的各项问题比较顺利，也比较切合实际。整风运动和反右派斗争，是我国在思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命，这是关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的带有决定意义的斗争；同时它也是带动一切工作的纲，它带来了共产主义思想大解放，推动了全民的生产和建设的高潮，也给工会工作带来了新的气象。
    自从整风和反右派斗争以来，在工会组织中已经清除了一批反党、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子。这些反动分子为数虽然不多，可是，他们的危害是很大的。他们不甘心党领导的社会主义革命的胜利，千方百计地破坏党领导的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。可是，在今天我国社会主义事业一日千里的发展，大势所趋，人心所向的形势下，他又不敢直接地反对党、反对社会主义，他们装成革命的样子，实际干着见不得人的反革命勾当。在工会组织中的右派分子，常常是把自己装扮成为一个“工人利益的关心者”，渲染成为一个工会工作者的“内行”，污蔑党不关心工人利益，不懂工会工作，破坏党的威信，破坏党和工人群众的关系。而我们某些工会干部由于思想上有行会观念，工团主义、经济主义思想情绪，有的就不能识破右派分子的真正面目，不能和他们进行坚决的斗争，甚至被他们所利用。因此，努力提高阶级觉悟水平，提高辨别是非的能力，克服各种错误思想，高高举起无产阶级的红旗，是狠狠地打击右派分子的反动言行，把右派分子从工会组织中清除出去的重要条件。而把右派分子从工会组织中清除出去，是党的事业的胜利，是社会主义的胜利，是兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想的胜利，是扫清阻碍工会工作前进的危险敌人的胜利。
    在整风运动中，由于采取了大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，放手地开展了对我们工作中的错误缺点的批评和自我批评，工会干部中的脱离党的领导的工团主义和脱离政治的经济主义思想、不能和党一条心的不同程度的个人主义、自由主义错误等，得到了很大程度的纠正。工会在党的领导下和职工群众的关系密切了，许多工会干部确实有新的姿态，心情舒畅，鼓足干劲地工作。这是可喜的新的气象。
    可是，是不是所有工会组织，每一个工会干部都作到了这样呢？还不能这样说。就以全国总工会为例，在去年轰轰烈烈的整风运动和反右派斗争中，前工人日报社社长、反党反人民反社会主义右派分子陈用文竟安然无事。只是在党的八大二次会议以后，学习了党的八大二次会议的文件和毛主席在这次会议上的讲话，解放了思想，树起了红旗，擦亮了眼睛，提高了认识，全国总工会的整风运动进一步深入了的时候，才把陈用文这个右派分子的真实面目完全暴露出来。这正像刘少奇同志在党的八大二次会议上说的，“从去年5月开始的整风运动，现在已经取得了巨大的成就。但是我们如果陶醉于已有的成就，以为已经万事大吉，那就是完全错误的了。必须看到，运动的发展是不平衡的。在有一些单位、有一些地方、有一些人们中间，整风运动进行得还不深不透。个别的单位，官僚主义、命令主义、宗派主义、主观主义的作风还没有动，甚至还由右派分子或坏分子占领，群众的积极性还受到压制。”全国总工会最近的进一步深入地进行整风，证明了刘少奇同志这个估计的正确性。全国总工会深入整风中揭发出来的这一情况，是不是只是全国总工会才有，而全国各地工会组织的整风都搞深搞透了呢？就在全国总工会机关中，是不是就只是工人日报的整风不深不透，其他单位都搞深搞透了呢？不能这样看。如果这样看，也会是错误的。
    工会的整风运动进一步深入，暴露了某些干部的思想上，还存在着脱离党的领导的工团主义、脱离政治的经济主义倾向；有的已经发展到标新立异，自立山头，自搞一套，和党对抗的不可容忍的地步。他们已经走到右派分子反党、反社会主义的边缘。而这种严重情况，在整风初期并没有给予应有批判，只是在整风运动进一步深入时才被揭露出来，受到彻底清算。
    不少工会干部中也还存在着反映落后工人思想、不从全局出发的行会观念，只顾眼前利益，不顾长远利益，只顾业务，不问政治的狭隘经济主义思想。而这些正是某些工会干部存在着不同程度的个人主义、自由主义的错误思想的反映。有这种思想作风的人，正是右派分子利用的对象；这种思想作风，也是资产阶级个人主义野心家的土壤。个人主义是共产主义的敌人。对个人主义容忍，就不能树起共产主义红旗。对个人主义和平共居，就是纵容资本主义向共产主义进攻。必须彻底克服个人主义思想，才能彻底改进工会干部的作风，完全和党一条心，深入群众，深入实际，和群众打成一片，有效地完成党的政治任务和中心工作。而要克服工会干部思想上的各种错误，就必须把整风运动深入下去，进行到底。
    目前我国正处于共产主义思想大解放，工农业生产大跃进，一天等于二十年的时代。工会工作要不落在群众后面，不落在运动后面，就必须彻底克服某些工会干部中的错误思想和言行，使工会工作在这样一个伟大时代中，以不断革命的精神，推动运动前进。这里的关键是把整风运动深入下去，进行到底。目前，在工会组织中继续深入地进行整风，是工会的一项极其重要的政治任务。
    工会组织整风的任务，就是使工会完全在党的领导下，克服一切脱离党的领导的倾向；就是要树立全局观点，从六亿人口出发的观点，加强工农联盟；克服分裂工人阶级团结，分裂全国人民团结的现象；就是要政治挂帅，加强政治思想工作，克服行会思想、狭隘的经济主义思想，使工会组织真正成为具有鲜明党性的工人阶级群众组织，使工会工作真正在社会主义建设中发挥积极的作用。
    在整风中，对右派分子要坚决地把他们清出工会组织；对待犯错误和思想上有毛病的人，应该是严肃批判，分别对待，贯彻“思想批判从严，处理从宽”的原则，达到“惩前毖后，治病救人”、“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”的目的。
    目前社会主义建设事业的各个方面都在大跃进，这是整风运动和反右派斗争胜利发展的结果，也是贯彻执行党的总路线的结果。工会组织要深入整风，不获全胜，决不收兵。只有这样，我们才能正确地执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，也才能使工会组织在社会主义建设事业中发挥它应有的作用。
