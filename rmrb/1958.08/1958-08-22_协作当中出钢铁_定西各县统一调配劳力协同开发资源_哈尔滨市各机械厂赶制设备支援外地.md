Steel is Produced Through Collaboration
    Dingxi Counties Coordinate Labor Allocation to Jointly Develop Resources
    Harbin Machinery Factories Rush to Manufacture Equipment to Support Other Regions

According to the Gansu Daily, the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Gansu Province convened a steel production collaboration conference in Gaolan in early August, studying the unified allocation of labor and the collaborative development of resources.

The conference determined to carry out comprehensive collaboration throughout the entire region. Collaboration will take two forms: The first form is comprehensive collaboration. Medium-sized iron mines will be established in Gaolan's Gada Well, Xiangshui, and Xiangxian, with Gaolan providing mineral deposits and Tongwei, Huining, Weiyuan, Dingxi, and Lintao dispatching labor to mine and smelt; coking plants will be established in Gaolan's Changwan and Hongshui, with Gaolan providing raw materials and Tongwei, Huining, and Lintao dispatching 3,000 laborers to coke; refractory material factories will be established in Gaolan and Xiangshui, with Gaolan providing raw materials and Dingxi, Tongwei, Weiyuan, and Lintao dispatching labor for production. In addition, Jingyuan will provide coke and refractory materials. Regarding cadres, funds, transportation tools, etc., it was decided to plan uniformly and allocate them for use.

The second form of collaboration is direct linkage, single-item collaboration. For example, Lintao will dispatch labor to Yongdeng's Pingchengbao to smelt iron; Huining, Lintao, Tongwei, and other counties will dispatch labor to Jingyuan to coke.

The conference proposed promoting collectivism and opposing decentralism; promoting the overall concept and opposing departmentalism; promoting close collaboration and opposing each doing their own thing; promoting objectivity and comprehensiveness and opposing subjectivity and one-sidedness; promoting mutual support and learning from each other's strengths to overcome weaknesses, and opposing non-communication, arrogance, and complacency; promoting organization and discipline and opposing disorganized and undisciplined behavior.

The conference discussed issues related to power equipment, technology, funds, transportation tools, and commodity supply for steel production and proposed solutions.

According to the Heilongjiang Daily, to ensure the "ascension to the throne" of the steel marshal, the local state-owned machinery factories in Harbin are speeding up the manufacture of various large, medium, and small-sized steel smelting equipment. Among them, the large equipment with complex technical conditions includes: a 255 cubic meter blast furnace with an annual output of 120,000 tons of pig iron, a 6-ton converter with an annual output of 60,000 tons of steel, and a 950 steel plate rolling mill with an annual output of 25,000 tons of steel plate. In addition, there are mining machinery and equipment such as blowers, electric motors, and water pumps. All these equipments must be successfully trial-produced and put into mass production before the end of this year.

The machinery factories undertaking the manufacture of these steel rolling and smelting equipment have adopted the measure of "stopping production to give way" for daily products that are less urgently needed, giving priority to the manufacture of steel smelting equipment. For example, Songjiang Electric Furnace Factory has shifted from manufacturing general resistance furnaces to manufacturing steelmaking electric arc furnaces; Songha Machinery Factory and Jilian Machinery Factory have shifted from producing general-purpose machinery to mass-producing various blowers needed by the smelting industry.

To accelerate the manufacture of steel rolling and smelting equipment, these poorly equipped machinery factories, in addition to strengthening production cooperation with large state-owned factories to manufacture some extra-large parts, are mainly relying on their own efforts, using the "ants gnawing at bones" method, and using small machine tools to produce large equipment. When Harbin Heavy Machinery Factory manufactured large blast furnaces, without a large roller bed, the workers came up with a way to suspend the rolling with pulleys, breaking through the key to production. Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory, in the absence of a large plate bending machine, the workers have used indigenous methods to produce 22 steelmaking converters.

The steel smelting equipment manufactured in Harbin, in addition to a small part being used to equip the city's steel industry, most of it is used to support the development of the steel industry in various parts of the country and fraternal regions within the province. The 255 cubic meter blast furnace produced by Harbin Heavy Machinery Factory will support Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xinjiang and other provinces and regions; the electric furnaces produced by Songjiang Electric Furnace Factory and the converters produced by Forestry Machinery Factory will support various parts of the country; even the small output of rolling mills will support the development of the steel industry in the Northwest and other regions.

　　协作当中出钢铁
    定西各县统一调配劳力协同开发资源
    哈尔滨市各机械厂赶制设备支援外地
    据甘肃日报报道  中共甘肃省定西地委8月上旬在皋兰召开了钢铁生产协作会议，研究了统一调配劳动力和协作开发资源的问题。
    会议确定在全区范围内开展全面大协作。协作采取两种形式：第一种形式是综合全面协作。在皋兰尕达井、响水、乡岘建立中型铁矿，由皋兰提供矿藏，通渭、会宁、渭源、定西、临洮抽调劳动力采矿冶炼；在皋兰长湾、红水建立炼焦厂，皋兰提供原料，通渭、会宁、临洮抽调劳动力三千人炼焦；在皋兰、响水建立耐火材料厂，皋兰提供原料，定西、通渭、渭源、临洮抽调劳动力进行生产。此外，由靖远提供焦炭和耐火材料。对干部、资金、运输工具等问题，决定统一计划，分配使用。
    第二种协作形式是直接挂钩，单项协作。例如，由临洮抽调劳动力去永登平成堡炼铁；由会宁、临洮、通渭等县抽调劳动力去靖远炼焦。
    会议提出提倡集体主义、反对分散主义；提倡整体观念，反对本位主义；提倡通力协作，反对各搞一套；提倡客观全面，反对主观片面；提倡互相支援、取长补短，反对互不联系，骄傲自满；提倡组织性、纪律性，反对无组织、无纪律的行为。
    会议对有关钢铁生产的动力设备、技术、资金、运输工具和商品供应等问题都进行了讨论，并提出了解决办法。
    据黑龙江日报报道  为保证钢铁元帅升帐，哈尔滨市地方国营各机械厂，正快马加鞭地制造各种大中小型的钢铁冶炼设备。其中技术条件复杂的大型设备有：年产十二万吨生铁的二百五十五立方公尺的高炉，年产六万吨钢的六吨转炉，年产二万五千吨钢板的九五○钢板轧机。此外，还有矿山机械和鼓风机、电动机、水泵等设备。这些设备都要在今年年底以前试制成功，并大批投入生产。
    承制这些轧钢冶炼设备的各机械厂，对需要较缓的日常产品都采取了“停车让路”的措施，优先制造钢铁冶炼设备。例如，松江电炉厂由制造一般电阻炉，转为制造炼钢电弧炉；松哈机械厂和机联机械厂从生产通用机械，转向大量生产冶炼工业所需要的各种鼓风机。
    这些设备简陋的机械厂，为了加速制造轧钢冶炼设备，除了与国营大厂加强生产协作制造一些特大部件外，更主要的是自力更生，用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，用小机床生产大设备。哈尔滨重型机器厂制造大型高炉时，没有大的滚床，工人想出了用滑车吊着滚圆的办法，突破了生产关键，哈尔滨森工机械厂在没有大型滚板机的情况下，工人们用土办法已制出二十二台炼钢转炉。
    哈尔滨市制造的这些钢铁冶炼设备，除了少部分用来武装本市的钢铁工业以外，绝大部分都用来支援全国各地和省内兄弟地区发展钢铁工业。哈尔滨重型机器厂生产的二百五十五立方公尺的高炉，将支援广西、贵州、四川和新疆等省区；松江电炉厂生产的电炉，森工机械厂生产的转炉将支援全国各地；就是产量不多的轧钢机，也将支援西北等地发展钢铁工业。
