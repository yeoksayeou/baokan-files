　　A Great Revolution in Plowing Reform
　　Electric Rope-Drawn Plow Outperforms Tractor
　　This paper reports that the electric rope-drawn plowing experiments conducted by the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences have recently achieved initial success. On the morning of the 12th, a field operation demonstration was held in the suburbs of Beijing; on the 2nd, in the paddy fields near the Bakongzha Hydropower Station in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, personnel from the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute gave a demonstration of electric rope-drawn agricultural tool cultivation to representatives attending the National Rural Hydropower Conference, with good results. The creation of this new tool has opened up a new direction for the electrification of field operations in our country.
　　During the demonstration, people were very interested to see that they simply pressed a button on the automatic controller, and the motor drove the rollers to turn, the winch winched the steel cable, and the steel cable dragged the bidirectional plow back and forth through the pulleys on the automatic shifting rods placed at both ends of the field. When the plowing reached the end, the bidirectional plow automatically skipped the row and turned around. All that was needed was one person on the bank to control the button.
　　Currently, electricity in some rural areas is only used for irrigation, agricultural and sideline product processing, and lighting. Achieving electrification of agricultural cultivation has always been viewed with a sense of mystery. However, field operations consume the most human and animal power and have a direct impact on increasing production and income. The successful experiment of using electric power to drive ropes to pull this agricultural tool for field cultivation has shattered the sense of mystery and also shattered the past view that tractors have the highest plowing efficiency. This is because the electric rope-drawn plow has stronger adaptability than tractors and can cultivate in small plots of land such as paddy fields, swamps, rice paddies, and mountainous areas. If deep plowing is carried out, it can plow 1.5 mu of land per hour, with a plowing depth of 15 to 25 centimeters and a plowing width of 18 centimeters. If only a deep plowing level of around 16 to 18 centimeters is needed, the plowing speed of this plow can reach two mu of land per hour. It is more economical than tractors in terms of power consumption, fuel consumption, and cost, consuming only 1.5 kWh of electricity per mu, equivalent to 8.5 fen in RMB. It can save a lot of fuel and steel. The structure of this plow is also relatively simple, and the machinery factories of general agricultural cooperatives can assemble it. The operation technology is simple, and the masses can master it more easily. Therefore, this agricultural tool has broad development prospects. (Attached picture)

### 耕犁改革的大革命　电力绳索牵引犁胜过拖拉机

　　耕犁改革的大革命
　　电力绳索牵引犁胜过拖拉机
    本报讯　中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所进行的电力绳索牵引犁耕作的试验，最近已获得了初步成功。12日上午，在北京郊区进行了实地操作表演；2日，在河北省武清县八孔闸水电站附近的水田里，由农业机械化研究所人员向参加全国农村水电会议的代表进行了电力绳索牵引农具耕作的表演，效果良好。这种新工具的创造，为我国田间作业的电气化开辟了新方向。
    表演时，人们极有兴趣的看到，他们在自动控制器上按了一下电钮，电动机便带动滚轮转起来，绞盘绞动钢索，钢索经过田边两头安置的自动移行杆上的滑轮拖动双向犁来回耕地，耕地到头时双向犁便自动的跳行转向，只要一个人在岸上控制电钮就行了。
    目前我国部分农村用电只在排灌、农副业加工、照明上，对农业耕作实现电气化，一向存在着神秘观点，而田间作业消耗人畜力最多，对增产增收有着直接影响。采用电力拖动绳索的方法，牵引这种农具，进行田间耕作试验的成功，打破了神秘观点，也打破了过去一向认为拖拉机耕作效率最大的观点。因为，电力绳索牵引犁比拖拉机适应性强，在沤田、沼泽地、水稻田、山区等小块地内均能耕作。如果进行深耕，它每小时可耕地一点五亩，耕深十五到二十五公分，耕宽十八公分。如果进行深耕程度只需十六到十八公分左右，这种犁耕作的速度可以达到一小时二亩地。它比拖拉机在动力消耗、燃料消耗、成本费用上都要经济，每耕一亩地只消耗一点五度电，合人民币八分五厘。可节省大量燃料和钢材。这种犁构造也比较简单，一般农业社的机械厂都可以装配。操作技术简单，群众掌握也比较容易。所以，这种农具有着广阔的发展前途。（附图片）
