Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Taipei: It has been reported that recently, U.S. military personnel in the Taiwan area have been actively plotting military provocations.

U.S. "Taiwan Defense Command" Commander Smoot and Deputy Commander H. Bassett held a secret meeting with Chiang gang "Chief of the General Staff" Wang Shu-ming and Air Force "Commander-in-Chief" Chen Chia-shang on the 8th regarding the "situation in the Taiwan Strait area." On the same day, Paul T. Bollinger, commander of the 315th Air Transport Division of the U.S. Air Force in Japan, and several of his staff members also arrived in Taipei from Japan. They held discussions with Chiang gang "Chief of the General Staff" Wang Shu-ming on the morning of the 9th, and then went to the Tainan Air Force Base for "inspection." According to reports from the Chiang gang's Central News Agency and foreign news agencies, the main purpose of these U.S. military generals' large-scale activities in Taiwan is to strengthen the U.S. Navy's and Air Force's aggressive deployment in the Taiwan area.

Paul K. Baake, the Army Group leader of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, and Chiang gang "Minister of National Defense" Yu Ta-wei went to Kinmen on the 7th to boost the morale of Chiang's military officers and soldiers. Under their supervision, the Chiang army on Kinmen Island also held a joint land and naval combat exercise. Recently, U.S. Deputy Commander in Taiwan Doan visited the Chiang army's reserve training base in Taichung.

In recent days, some American imperialist elements have repeatedly clamored that the United States will accelerate the enhancement of the "defensive strength" of the Taiwan area. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Burke openly threatened the Chinese people at a press conference held in San Francisco on the 8th, saying, "The U.S. Navy is watching the situation in Taiwan very closely" and is prepared to send additional troops to Taiwan at any time. Former U.S. Commander in Taiwan Doyle more blatantly said recently that "Taiwan is the outpost of the free world," and therefore, the United States will accelerate the "modernization of equipment" of the Chiang army.

　　值得警惕的美蒋阴谋
　　美军事人员在台湾大肆活动
    新华社11日讯　台北消息：最近以来，美国军事人员在台湾地区，积极策划军事挑衅阴谋。
    美国“台湾防御司令部”司令斯摩特、副司令赫·巴塞特同蒋帮“参谋总长”王叔铭、空军“总司令”陈嘉尚在8日就“台湾海峡地区的局势”举行了秘密会议。同一天，美国驻日本空军三一五空运师师长包登格和他的参谋人员多人也由日本到台北，在9日上午和蒋帮“参谋总长”王叔铭作了商谈，然后前往台南空军基地“视察”。据蒋帮中央社和外电透露，这些美军将领在台湾大肆活动的主要目的，是要加强美国海军和空军在台湾地区的侵略部署。
    美国军事援助顾问团陆军组长包凯和蒋帮“国防部长”俞大维在7日曾到金门，为蒋军官兵打气。在他们的监督下，金门岛上的蒋军又举行了陆、海军联合作战演习。最近，侵台美军副司令多安曾到台中蒋军后备军训练基地视察。
    最近几天来，美国的一些帝国主义分子一再叫嚷美国将加速增强台湾地区的“防御力量”。美国海军作战参谋长伯克8日在旧金山举行的记者招待会上，公然恫吓中国人民说：“美国海军正非常密切地注视着台湾局势”，并且准备随时向台湾增派兵力。前任侵台美军司令道伊尔在最近更露骨地说什么“台湾是自由世界的前哨堡垒”，为此，美国将加速把蒋军“装备成现代化”。
