Xinhua News Agency, Nanning Telegram Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, while establishing a large number of small-scale ironmaking and steelmaking furnaces, pays close attention to the development of coking production, so as to "move the troops only after food and fodder are ready."

At present, factories, handicraft cooperatives, and shops in Bobai, Pingle, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou have successively succeeded in coking bituminous coal and are actively building factories to prepare for mass production. A factory in Liuzhou did not have a cooling device, but the workers used teacups and bamboo tubes instead, and in mid-July, they used raw coal to produce qualified coke.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram Jiangsu Province, Changzhou City, broke the single-minded thinking of "only managing ironmaking and not managing coking" to ensure that coking and ironmaking advance side by side.

The Changzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that the Standing Committee Member and Mayor of the Municipal Party Committee should take the lead, and the leaders of various departments and units should personally take the lead to lead the masses in the spirit of engaging in indigenous methods, small scale, quantity, and speed, and adopt the method of building kilns, loading kilns, and lighting fires at the same time to accelerate the construction of coking kilns. As of July 26, the city had built more than 1,500 kilns.

This newspaper reports that the indigenous blast furnace of the Mayu Ironworks in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, successfully used anthracite coal instead of wood and coke to make iron.

When this ironworks was put into production in early May, it used wood to make iron, which was both labor-intensive and material-intensive. The successful use of anthracite coal to make iron greatly reduced the cost of pig iron.

At present, many areas in Henan are promoting this experience. (Bai Zhongjie)

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is making every effort to produce fire bricks for the steel industry.

Inner Mongolia originally had only one local state-owned Baotou Refractory Material Factory, and the output of fire bricks was small, far from meeting the needs of the rapid development of the steel industry in Inner Mongolia. For this reason, handicraft production cooperatives and some power plants in Yikezhao League, Ulanqab League, Zhaowuda League, Hulunbuir League and other places have successfully fired fire bricks using indigenous methods. The quality of the first kiln of fire bricks recently fired in Dongsheng, Dalate Banner, and Chifeng is also very good. Now the handicraft departments of various places have decided to produce 50,000 tons of fire bricks using indigenous methods this year.

In addition, Baotou City has also begun to step up the construction of a number of large and small fire brick kilns, and is preparing to build a refractory material factory with an annual output of 70,000 tons, which can also produce more than 30,000 tons of fire bricks before the end of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is establishing indigenous coking plants to produce a large amount of coke.

Workers and farmers of all ethnic groups in the Shiguai Ditch Mining Area of Baotou City decided to build a total of eleven new coking plants, which can produce more than 60,000 tons of coke before the end of the year. The Yonglian Agricultural Cooperative in this mining area recently established a small-scale indigenous coking plant, and has shipped out the first batch of more than 20 tons of coke to meet local needs. Coal mines such as Yanggeleng and Zhuozishan are also beginning to produce coke in large quantities.

    为钢铁工业储“粮”备“草”
    广西等地大力发展炼焦生产
　　内蒙古土洋并举生产耐火砖
    据新华社南宁电　广西僮族自治区在建立大批小型炼铁、炼钢炉子的同时，十分注意发展炼焦生产，做到“兵马未动，粮草先行”。
    目前，博白、平乐、柳州及梧州等地的一些工厂、手工业社和商店，都先后用烟煤炼焦成功，并且在积极建厂，准备大批生产。柳州一个工厂没有冷却装置，但是职工们采用茶缸、竹筒代替，在7月中旬就用原煤炼出了质量合格的焦炭。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省常州市打破“只管炼铁不管炼焦”的单一思想，保证炼焦、炼铁齐头并进。
    中共常州市委决定由市委常委、市长挂帅，各部门、各单位领导亲自出马，带领群众本着搞土、搞小、搞多、搞快的精神，采取边建窑、边装窑、边点火的办法，加速建设炼焦窑。到7月26日止，全市共建窑一千五百多座。
    本报讯　河南省登封县马峪炼铁厂的土高炉，使用无烟煤代替木材和焦炭炼铁成功。
    这座炼铁厂5月初投入生产时，用木材炼铁，既费工又费料。用无烟煤炼铁成功，使生铁成本大大降低。
    目前，河南有许多地区已在推广这一经验。　（白中杰）
    新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区正在千方百计地为钢铁工业生产耐火砖。
    内蒙古原来只有一座地方国营包头耐火器材厂，耐火砖产量不大，远远不能满足内蒙古地区钢铁工业迅速发展的需要。为此，伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟、昭乌达盟、呼伦贝尔盟等地手工业生产合作社和部分发电厂，纷纷采用土办法烧制耐火砖成功。东胜、达拉特旗、赤峰等地，最近烧成的第一窑耐火砖质量也很好。现在各地手工业部门决定，在今年内用土办法生产耐火砖五万吨。
    此外，包头市也已开始加紧兴建一批耐火砖大窑、小窑，并且筹建一座年产七万吨的耐火材料厂，年底以前也能生产出三万多吨耐火砖。
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区正在创办土法炼焦场，大量生产焦炭。
    包头市石拐沟矿区各民族职工、农民决定新建的炼焦场共达十一座，年底前就能生产出六万多吨焦炭。这个矿区的永联农业社最近建立的小型土法炼焦场，已经运出第一批焦炭二十多吨供应当地需要。杨圪楞、桌子山等煤矿，也在开始大量生产焦炭。
