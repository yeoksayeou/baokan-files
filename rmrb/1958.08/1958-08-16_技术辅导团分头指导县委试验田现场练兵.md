　　Technical Guidance Teams Provide On-site Coaching at County Party Committee Experimental Farms

(Our Wuhan dispatch, August 15th) (Reporter Feng Jian) In Hubei Province, along the Yangtze and Han Rivers, over the past month, more than 2,400 indigenous and modern small blast furnaces have been erected, along with nineteen small converters. Additionally, more than 2,300 small blast furnaces and twenty-seven small converters are under construction. With the establishment of these numerous small blast furnaces, Hubei faces a pressing new problem: how to ensure these newly built furnaces produce iron smoothly and rapidly normalize production? The Hubei Provincial Party Committee and local leading departments have promptly taken strong measures to address this issue.

First, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee organized a robust steel industry technical guidance team. In late July, they dispatched six groups to various special districts and counties to assist in resolving all technical issues related to steel production. This guidance team, comprising over three hundred members, was drawn from twenty-two factories, mines, and schools, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Daye Steel Plant, and the Central China Institute of Technology, covering technical expertise in smelting, testing, and equipment manufacturing. The guidance team has already helped many localities overcome difficulties such as separating slag, extracting molten iron, and clarifying ore composition. A technical guidance group led by Zhou Bangjie, a steelmaking foreman from Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, visited the Xiaozidian Iron Smelting Plant in Dawu County. After systematically studying furnace construction, baking, and smelting operations, they not only ensured the normal production of this indigenous blast furnace but also comprehensively summarized five thousand characters of technical operational experience.

Second, widespread on-site training was conducted to cultivate technical skills self-reliantly at the fastest possible speed. The base for this training was the "steel experimental farms" of local and county Party committee leading cadres; the training method involved on-site meetings with simultaneous observation, learning, and doing, followed by widespread application. The deputy county head of Yidu County, the deputy director of the County Party Committee's Industrial and Transportation Department, and the deputy director of the Industry Bureau established two experimental furnaces in Xiannyudong and Gulaobei Township. The County Party Committee promptly organized three levels of cadres from across the county to concentrate at the experimental furnace site, watching and learning simultaneously. Within twenty days after the meeting, forty-four indigenous blast furnaces were built throughout the county, fourteen of which were able to operate normally, making it one of the province's advanced counties in developing the steel industry.

Third, typical experiences were summarized and promoted throughout the province, and red flags were planted. Currently, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee is summarizing several typical experiences, including how the county mobilized the entire population to vigorously develop the steel industry, smelting techniques, indigenous coking methods, and the rapid cultivation of technical skills. The Provincial Party Committee has also instructed local and county Party committees to focus on model cases, exchange experiences through on-site meetings, and consolidate and improve the production of already established steel plants.

　　技术辅导团分头指导县委试验田现场练兵
    本报武汉15日电　记者冯健报道：湖北省长江、汉水两岸，最近一个多月来，已经竖立起二千四百多座土洋小高炉，十九座小转炉，还有二千三百多座小高炉和二十七座小转炉正在加紧建设。千百座小高炉建起以后，湖北各地面临着一个十分急迫的新问题：怎样使这些新建高炉顺利出铁，生产迅速正常化？湖北省委和各地领导部门及时采取了有力的措施来解决这一问题。
    第一，湖北省委组织了一个实力雄厚的钢铁工业技术辅导团，在7月下旬分六路出发到各专区、县，帮助解决钢铁生产中的一切技术问题。这个辅导团有三百多人，是由武钢、大冶钢厂、华中工学院等二十二个厂矿、学校，抽调冶炼、化验和设备制造三个方面的技术力量组成的。辅导团已经帮助许多地方解决了铁渣分不开、铁水流不出、矿石成分不清等困难。由武钢炼铁工长周邦杰带领的一个技术辅导组，到大悟县孝子店炼铁厂以后，对建炉、烘炉和冶炼操作进行了系统的研究，不但保证了这座土高炉的正常生产，还完整地总结了五千字的技术操作经验。
    第二，各地普遍举行了现场练兵，用最快的速度自力更生地培训技术力量。练兵的基地是各地委、县委领导干部的“钢铁试验田”；练兵的方法是通过现场会，边看、边学、边做，会后四面开花。宜都县的副县长、县委工业交通部副部长和工业局副局长等，在仙女洞和古老背镇建立了两座试验炉。县委及时组织全县三级干部集中在试验炉现场，一边看一边学。会后二十天内，全县建起了四十四座土高炉，其中有十四座能正常生产，成为全省兴办钢铁工业的先进县之一。
    第三，总结和推广典型经验，在全省插红旗。目前，湖北省委正在总结几项典型经验，包括县如何发动全民大办钢铁工业、冶炼技术、土法炼焦、快速培养技术力量等方面。省委还指示各地委、县委抓典型，通过现场会议交流经验，把已经办起的钢铁厂从生产上加以巩固、提高。
