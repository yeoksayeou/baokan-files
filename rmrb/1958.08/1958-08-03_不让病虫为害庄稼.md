Current Agricultural Production Should Pay Attention To:

    Don't Let Pests and Diseases Harm Crops
    The next month or two is the peak breeding and most harmful period for rice stem borers, corn borers, locusts, cotton bollworm, rice blast, potato late blight and other various diseases and insect pests. Resolutely eliminating these diseases and insect pests and not allowing them to ruin autumn crops is an important task in current agricultural production work.
    In the first half of this year, various localities have already achieved considerable results in the surging mass prevention and control campaign. In recent days, good news has been frequently reported. According to reports from Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Anhui, Jiangxi and other five provinces alone, twenty-eight counties have eliminated cotton aphids, locusts, wheat bugs, pea weevils, rice bacterial leaf blight and other diseases and insect pests, achieving the requirements of the National Programme for Agricultural Development ten years ahead of schedule.
    The prevention and control work in the first half of this year has also brought us a lot of experience. Seriously summarizing and promoting these experiences can win greater victories in the prevention and control of autumn crop diseases and insect pests. Leaders taking command, establishing a pest control command organization that goes all the way to the bottom, achieving a combination of leadership, the masses, and technology; formulating plans for eliminating diseases and insect pests at each level, holding on-site promotion meetings at each level, training technical backbones at each level, establishing pest situation organizations at each level; vigorously developing indigenous pesticides and methods, actively modifying and promoting improved machinery, etc., are the main parts of these experiences.
    There are many types of autumn crops, diseases and insect pests occur widely, and the area requiring prevention and control is large. Although the supply of pesticides this year has increased several times compared with last year, the required quantity is growing even faster. Therefore, to eliminate autumn crop diseases and insect pests, it is necessary to further criticize the "theory of relying solely on foreign medicines" and widely adopt various prevention and control methods from the masses. Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province did not relax prevention and control work due to the lack of "666" and "DDT," but according to the phototactic habits of rice planthoppers and rice thrips, comprehensively carried out the method of burning fire to attract insects in late June, which achieved very good results. The Taizhou Prefectural Agricultural Bureau also experimented with methods of using sapium sebiferum leaves, leeks, and garlic to control rice blast. In order to solve the shortage of pesticides, Hunan Province established more than 10,000 indigenous pesticide processing plants in Chen County alone. These situations show that there are indigenous pesticides and methods for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests everywhere; the problem is that we must be good at discovering and promoting them.
    The next month or two is a busy season for various agricultural tasks such as flood prevention, drought resistance, mid-season cultivation, weeding, rushing to harvest, and rushing to plant. To solve the contradiction between the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests and other agricultural tasks, on the one hand, it is necessary to tap labor potential and mobilize women to participate in prevention and control work; on the other hand, it is necessary to establish specialized disease and insect pest prevention and control teams in production teams to ensure prevention and control quality and improve prevention and control efficiency.

### 不让病虫为害庄稼

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

    不让病虫为害庄稼
    今后一两个月正是水稻螟虫、玉米螟虫、蝗虫、棉花蕾铃期害虫以及稻瘟病、马铃薯晚疫病等多种多样病虫害繁殖最盛、为害最烈的时期。坚决消灭这些病虫害，不使它们糟践秋田作物，是当前农业生产工作中的一项重要任务。
    今年上半年各地在风起云涌的群众性防治运动中，已经获得不少的成绩。连日来，更是喜报频传，仅据山西、河南、甘肃、安徽、江西等五省报告，就有二十八个县分别消灭了棉蚜、蝗虫、麦椿象、豌豆象、水稻白叶枯病等病虫害，提前十年实现了农业发展纲要的要求。
    今年上半年的防治工作还给我们带来了不少经验，认真总结和推广这些经验，就能在防治秋田作物病虫害工作中赢得更大的胜利。领导挂帅，建立一竿子到底的灭虫指挥机构，做到领导、群众、技术三结合；层层制订消灭病虫害的规划，层层召开现场促进会，层层培训技术骨干，层层建立虫情组织；大搞土药土方，积极改装和推广改良器械等，是这些经验中的主要部分。
    秋田作物种类多，病虫害发生普遍，需要防治的面积大。今年农药的供应数量虽比去年增长几倍，但需要的数量增长更快。因此，要消灭秋田作物病虫害必须进一步批判“唯洋药论”，广泛采用各种来自群众的防治方法。浙江省金华专区并没因为缺乏“六六六”、“滴滴涕”放松了防治工作，而是根据稻浮尘子、稻虱虫的趋光习性，在6月下旬全面开展了烧火诱虫的办法，收到很好效果。台州专区农业局还试验出用乌桕叶、韭菜、大蒜头防治稻瘟病的方法。湖南省为解决农药不足，仅郴县一个专区就办起一万多个土药加工厂。这些情况说明，各地都有防治病虫的土药、土法，问题在于我们要善于发掘推广。
    今后一两个月是防汛、抗旱、中耕、除草、抢收、抢种等各种农活大忙的季节。解决防治病虫害与其他农活的矛盾，一方面要挖掘劳动潜力，发动妇女参加防治工作；另一方面要在生产队中成立专业防治病虫组，保证防治质量，提高防治效率。
