Editor's Note

　　The Great Leap Forward Needs Role Models
　　Currently, the three words "Great Leap Forward" have almost become a common saying. However, the language of a common saying does not mean that everyone has already entered the realm of the Great Leap Forward. Here, there is a Great Leap Forward, a Medium Leap Forward, and also a Small Leap Forward.
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed this unbalanced state and selected eight factories from the more advanced units, summarized their experiences, and called on all units in the city to: compete in ideology, promote the communist spirit; compete in work style, integrate with workers and peasants; compete in wisdom, vigorously engage in the technological revolution and the cultural revolution; compete in drive, leap forward again and again.
    Selecting role models, proposing slogans, and launching competitions are good methods to promote the leap forward again and again in various tasks. Correctly applying this method will cause a vigorous and thriving Great Leap Forward competition movement to develop.

　　大跃进要有榜样
　　目前，大跃进三个字几乎成了人们的口头禅。但是，口头禅的语言并不等于每个人都已经进入大跃进的境地。这里，有大跃进，中跃进，还有小跃进。
    中共上海市委分析了这种不平衡状态，从现在比较先进的单位中挑选了八个工厂，总结经验，号召全市各个单位：比思想，发扬共产主义精神，比作风，同工农群众打成一片，比智慧，大闹技术革命和文化革命；比干劲，跃进再跃进。
    选出榜样，提出口号，开展竞赛，这是促进各项工作跃进再跃进的好方法。正确地运用这个方法，一个轰轰烈烈的大跃进的竞赛运动就会蓬蓬勃勃开展起来。
