Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd - The Nongchong Cooperative in Che'ao Township, Zhangpu County, which has been recognized as a model advanced unit for peanut high yield in Fujian Province for three consecutive years, recently harvested 33,524 jin of peanuts from a 1.04 mu peanut experimental plot. After drying, this amounted to 25,143 jin, averaging 24,176 jin per mu. This is the highest peanut yield per mu record in the country to date.

　　On the morning of August 17, more than sixty members of the Seventh Production Team of Nongchong Cooperative, led by Cooperative Director Lin Shuili, carried hoes and large baskets to harvest this peanut field. The initial plan was to complete the harvest in two days, but the more they dug, the more they found, with peanuts still present at the seventh layer. The nearly one hundred baskets brought by the team were already full. They had to borrow more than one hundred baskets from other production teams, but even then, they couldn't hold all the peanuts, so they had to pile them on the ground in stacks. Female member Lin Shiliu became more and more energetic as she dug, even forgetting to go back and cook. Young people curiously picked up a few peanut clusters to calculate, generally finding more than ninety grains per cluster, with the most having one hundred and twenty-eight grains, and each grain was full, with a thin shell and large kernel. This experimental plot was planted with more than 120,000 clusters. When everyone did the math, their hearts leaped: some said there were 10,000 jin, some said 20,000 jin, and there was much discussion. By evening that day, the members were exhausted, and the road was blocked with heavily stacked baskets, but only a portion of the peanuts in the field had been harvested. After repeated digging and cleaning for the second and third days, all the peanuts were finally collected.

　　When this high-yield peanut field was harvested, Lin Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, Yang Yangkun, a technical cadre from the Agricultural Bureau of the County People's Committee, and Wang Quansheng, a reporter from the Zhangpu County Newspaper, participated throughout the process. Ma Xingyuan, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, Hong Yezi, First Secretary of the Longxi Prefectural Party Committee, Zhang Quanjin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Prefectural Party Committee, Li Zhenjing, First Secretary of the Zhangpu County Party Committee, Chen Mingxiang, Director of the Organization Department, and others, rushed to the site to inspect and measure the land after hearing the news. After the inspection, Hong Yezi, Li Zhenjing and others, on behalf of the Prefectural and County Party Committees, congratulated the cadres and members of the Nongchong Cooperative and encouraged them to continue their efforts and maintain their honor.

　　The main experiences in planting this peanut high-yield field are: first, selecting a local high-quality variety with a large butt for highly dense planting. The row and plant spacing was 1.5 inches by 2.5 inches, with 420 jin of seeds sown per mu. The second is early plowing and multiple plowing. This field has sandy soil and was planted with garlic last year. After the garlic harvest before the winter solstice, it was plowed, and then four plowing and five harrowing operations were carried out. The third is applying a lot of base fertilizer and reasonable top dressing. The base fertilizer consisted of 1,000 dan of garbage soil mixed fertilizer, 200 dan of duck manure, 300 dan of cattle manure, and 500 dan of human manure. Top dressing was applied three times, the first time with 50 jin of Tianfen fertilizer and 500 dan of water fertilizer, the second time with 30 jin of superphosphate using the method of foliar fertilization, and the third time with 300 jin of grass ash. The fourth is timely earthing up and vine pressing. The fifth is strengthening field management and establishing a dedicated person responsibility system.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd - The Qingfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shilong Township, Luxian County, Sichuan Province, has launched a high-yield sorghum "satellite." This cooperative's one mu of sorghum land yielded a net harvest of 5,333 jin, an increase of eight and a half times compared to last year's yield of 550 jin per mu.

　　The average yield of the cooperative's total of 42 mu of sorghum this year reached 3,809 jin per mu, an increase of nearly six times compared to last year.

　　The main reasons for achieving high yields are: during spring plowing and production, through debate, the erroneous thinking of cooperative members who valued paddy fields over dry land was criticized, and the planting technology of the dry land crop sorghum was boldly reformed. In the past, the row and plant spacing of sorghum was very sparse, with only more than 2,000 ears per mu; this year, it was densely planted to 14,000 ears, and the one mu that achieved high yield even had as many as 30,000 ears. Four to six granular fertilizer particles were applied to each nest as base fertilizer, and more than 25,000 jin of human and animal manure were applied as top dressing.

　　花生“卫星”一颗赛过一颗
    福建高产纪录两万四千斤
    四川庆丰社一亩高粱5333斤
    新华社福州23日电　连续三年荣获福建省花生丰产模范先进单位的漳浦县车鳌乡农冲社，最近在一亩零四厘的花生试验地里，共收摘花生三万三千五百二十四斤，晒干后是二万五千一百四十三斤，平均亩产二万四千一百七十六斤。这是截至目前为止的全国花生亩产最高纪录。
    8月17日清早，农冲社第七生产队的六十多个社员，在社主任林水利带领下，扛着锄头和大箩筐去收获这丘花生。当时，准备在两天内收完，可是越挖越多，挖到七层还有花生。队里拿来的近百个箩筐已装得满满的，后来又去别个生产队借了一百多个箩筐，还是装不完，只好把花生倒在地上一堆堆地排列起来。女社员林石榴越挖越有劲，连饭都忘记回去烧。青年人好奇地抱起几穴花生来盘算，一般每穴都有九十多粒，最多的一穴有一百二十八粒，而且粒粒饱满，壳薄粒大。这一丘试验田共种了十二万多穴，这样一推算，大家的心都跳起来：有的说有一万斤，有的说有两万斤，议论纷纷。到当天傍晚，社员们已经累得精疲力尽，路上箩筐重重叠叠地堆得道路不通，但是地里的花生还只收获了一部分。经过第二天第三天反复刨挖清扫，才把花生全部收完。
    这一丘花生丰产地在收获时，乡党委副书记林国瑞、县人民委员会农业局技术干部杨养坤、漳浦县报记者王全盛等自始至终参加。中共福建省委农村工作部副部长马兴元、中共龙溪地委第一书记洪椰子、地委副秘书长张全金、中共漳浦县委第一书记李振经、组织部长陈铭祥等，闻讯都赶到现场验收，并丈量了土地。验收后，洪椰子、李振经等代表地委、县委向农冲社干部和社员祝贺，并勉励他们继续努力，保持荣誉。
    种植这一丘花生的主要经验是：第一，选用大屁股本地良种进行高度密植。株行距是一点五寸乘二点五寸，每亩播种子四百二十斤。第二是早翻，多翻。这丘地是砂质土壤，去年种了大蒜，冬至前大蒜收获后翻犁，以后又进行了四犁五耙。第三是多施基肥，合理追肥。基肥共下垃圾土杂肥一千担，鸭肥二百担，牛粪三百担，人粪尿五百担；先后追肥三次，第一次施肥田粉五十斤、水肥五百担，第二次采用根外追肥的办法施了过磷酸钙三十斤，第三次施了草木灰三百斤。第四是适时培土和压藤。第五是加强田间管理，建立专人负责制。
    新华社成都23日电　四川省泸县石龙乡庆丰农业社放出了一颗高粱高产“卫星”。这个社的一亩高粱地，净收五千三百三十三斤，比去年亩产五百五十斤增加八倍半。
    这个社全社今年种植的四十二亩高粱，平均每亩产量达三千八百零九斤，比去年增产近六倍。
    获得高产的主要原因是：春耕生产中通过辩论，批判了社员中重水田轻旱地的错误思想，大胆改革了旱地作物高粱的种植技术。过去种高粱行株距很稀，每亩只有两千多穗；今年密植到一万四千穗，其中获得高产的一亩甚至多达三万穗。每窝底肥施颗粒肥料四到六颗，追施人畜粪二万五千多斤。
