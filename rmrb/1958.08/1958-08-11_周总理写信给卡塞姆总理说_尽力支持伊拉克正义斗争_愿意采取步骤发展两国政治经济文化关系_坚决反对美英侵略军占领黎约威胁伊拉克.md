To His Excellency General Abd al-Karim Qasim, Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq:

　　I have the honor to receive Your Excellency's telegram of July 18th. I am very pleased that our two countries have now mutually recognized each other, and I fully agree with Your Excellency's wish expressed in the telegram, that this mutual recognition will lead to friendly cooperation between the two countries and promote world peace. My government is willing to take steps to develop political, economic, and cultural relations between our two countries at a time deemed appropriate by Your Excellency and your government.

　　We greatly admire Your Excellency and the Iraqi people under Your Excellency's leadership for your heroic national revolutionary struggle, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty, the running dogs of US and British imperialism, establishing an anti-imperialist republic, and achieving a great victory. I would like to express to Your Excellency that the Chinese government and the Chinese people will do their best to support the struggle of your government and people to safeguard national independence and oppose imperialist aggression.

　　The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the aggressive acts of US and British imperialism in armed occupation of Lebanon and Jordan, armed threats to the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries, and undermining peace in the Middle East and the world. The Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly maintain that the US and British imperialists must immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan respectively, and immediately cease their threats and provocations against other Arab countries.

　　We are deeply convinced that the people of the Republic of Iraq and the people of all Arab countries, who have awakened and are constantly strengthening their unity, will surely achieve greater and more brilliant victories in the just struggle against colonialist aggression.

　　Please accept, Your Excellency, the highest respect.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai
