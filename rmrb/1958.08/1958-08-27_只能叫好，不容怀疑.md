Only Praise Allowed, No Doubt Permitted
　　Fú Niú

　　Recently, the broad masses of workers and peasants in various regions have been studying philosophy extensively and applying philosophy greatly. This is something that deserves enthusiastic applause.

　　Judging from the facts of workers and peasants studying theory in various places and the current Great Leap Forward in production, it fully demonstrates that Marxism-Leninism philosophy has the deepest foundation among the people. The practice of the people is the soil in which philosophy takes root, sprouts, and blossoms; and only when the people master the weapon of philosophy can they thoroughly liberate their minds and promote social development. Therefore, all true Marxist-Leninists must warmly welcome and value the study of Marxist-Leninist theory by workers and peasants.

　　However, strangely enough, in the face of any new thing, there always appear some "onlookers," frowning and hesitant, observing and doubting. When workers and peasants want to study theory, some people initially think that they lack culture, how can they understand "profound" theories? After tens of thousands of people boldly studied and various newspapers and periodicals introduced a large number of facts showing that workers can not only learn philosophy but also apply it after learning, this doubt was dispelled. Afterward, some people vaguely saw "flaws" and even said that the reality that workers and peasants connected with was "vulgarizing" Marxism-Leninism theory, and lamented that "this is destroying the scientific and systematic nature of Marxism-Leninism."

　　This is mostly the hissing of dogmatists or those with dogmatic thinking.

　　Dogmatists are accustomed to walking on one leg, from books to books, and finally still books. They learn theory for the sake of learning theory, ignoring reality and the creativity of the people. Or, like the human bodies painted by futurist painters, their bodies "become an unsightly bag placed on a pair of stilts with two five-toothed rakes attached." The bag is full of knowledge from books, top-heavy, and unsteady when walking, staggering. The "five-toothed rake" is just for show, to scare away sparrows, but cannot cultivate. Naturally, they cannot stand the posture of laborers who work with their hands and feet on the ground, nor can they stand the learning method of workers and peasants from practice to theory and then from theory to practice. It is not difficult to see that the so-called destruction of scientific and systematic nature is nothing more than to exclude dissidents and deliberately create difficulties.

　　Marxism-Leninism theory has a high degree of scientific and systematic nature. However, what dogmatists approve of is only that kind of scientific and systematic nature that is divorced from practice, isolated and static, metaphysical, and hypocritical, which is vastly different from the true scientific and systematic nature. Engels said: "In Marx's view, science is a historically dynamic force, a revolutionary force." When Lenin pointed out that Marx's theory combined the highest degree of strict scientific nature and revolutionary nature, he emphasized that Marx believed that the value of his theory lay entirely in that it was "fundamentally a critical and revolutionary theory." It can be seen that scientific Marxism, that is, the theory that unifies theory and practice, is used to conduct revolutionary criticism of practice, guide practice, and serve practice. And the so-called systematic nature is nothing more than that the theory should develop with the development of practice. Dogmatists do not like practice, keep the theory in books and dare not develop it, so what qualifications do they have to criticize others?

　　The facts that workers in Shanghai and Tianjin, farmers in Dengfeng, Henan, and workers and peasants in Heilongjiang have improved their way of thinking and working methods after learning philosophy, greatly promoting production, all illustrate that they have learned well, used it skillfully, and truly achieved the unity of learning and application, the close combination of theory and practice, and have already turned theory into a material force. They have moved from objective necessity to the conscious "kingdom of freedom." Even the women in Nankai District, Tianjin, who learned philosophy, have achieved significant results in eliminating superstitious ideas, enhancing unity, and improving street work. Perhaps what annoys dogmatists the most is that women use dialectics to solve those so-called trivial matters. But life is full of contradictions, including these "trivial" contradictions, and materialist dialectics is generalized from the natural world and social life, and it should completely "condescend" to solve such contradictions. Lenin once taught us not to turn science into fashionable empty talk, but to make it "completely and truly a component of life." This is exactly what the workers and peasants have done. They simply ignore the dogmatists' tricks of playing with concepts and turn theory into a "component of life." How can there be any talk of destroying the scientific and systematic nature of Marxism?

　　Now is the era of the great popularization and great development of Marxism-Leninism theory, and also the era of burying human prehistory. For the movement of workers and peasants learning theory, only praise is allowed, no doubt and opposition are permitted. It is the glorious and unshirkable task of every Marxist-Leninist to help workers and peasants learn theory well with increasing enthusiasm.

　　只能叫好，不容怀疑
　　伏牛
    最近各地广大工农群众，大学哲学，大用哲学。这是一件应当举起双手来叫好的事情。
    从各地工农学习理论的事实和当前的生产大跃进来看，完全说明了马克思主义哲学在人民群众中有最深厚的基础。人民群众的实践是哲学生根发芽开花的土壤；而人民群众只有掌握了哲学这个武器，才能使自己的思想彻底地解放，并推动社会的发展。因此，一切真正的马克思列宁主义者，就不能不热烈欢迎和重视工农学习马克思主义理论这件事。
    但是，说也奇怪，在任何一件新事物面前，总要出现一些“观潮派”，疾首蹙额，观望怀疑，工农要学理论了，在先有人以为他们缺乏文化，怎能学懂“高深的”理论呢？成千上万的人斗胆学了，各报刊介绍了大量的事实说明工人不但能学哲学，而且学了还会运用。这一怀疑不攻自破了。之后，又有人有影无踪地看出了“破绽”，竟然说工农所联系的实际是把马克思列宁主义理论“庸俗化”了，并慨叹地说“这是破坏了马克思列宁主义的科学性和系统性”。
    这多半是教条主义者，或具有教条主义思想的人发出来的嘘声。
    教条主义者，习惯于用一条腿走路，从书本，到书本，最后还是书本。他们为学习理论而学习理论，无视实际，无视人民群众的创造性。或者像未来派画家所画的人体一样，他们的身体“变成放在一副高跷上的装有两柄五齿耙的一个不像样儿的袋子”。袋子里装满了书本上的知识，头重脚轻，走起路来脚不沾地，一摇三晃。“五齿耙”只是摆摆样儿，吓唬一下麻雀，而不能耕刈。自然，他们就看不惯用双手劳动、两脚踏实的劳动者那种走路的架势，看不惯工农群众从实践到理论，又从理论到实践的学习方法。这就不难看出，所谓破坏科学性和系统性，无非是为了排除异己，故作刁难。
    马克思列宁主义理论是有着高度的科学性和系统性的。但教条主义者所赞成的，不过是那种脱离实践的、孤立静止的、形而上学的、虚伪的科学性和系统性，与真正的科学性和系统性大相径庭。恩格斯说：“在马克思看来，科学是一种历史地运动的力量，一种革命的力量”。列宁在指出马克思的理论是把最高限度的严格的科学性和革命性结合起来时，强调指出马克思认为他的理论的价值全在于它“根本上就是批判的和革命的理论”。可见，科学的马克思主义，也就是理论和实践相统一的理论，它是用来对实践进行革命的批判，指导实践并服务于实践的。而所谓系统性，无非是指理论要随着实践的发展而发展。教条主义者不喜欢实践，把理论停留在书本上而不敢加以发展，又有什么资格来指摘别人呢？
    上海和天津的工人，河南登封的农民和黑龙江的工农群众，在学了哲学之后，改进了思想方法和工作方法，大大推进了生产的事实，在在说明，他们学得好，用得妙，真正做到了学用一致，理论同实践密切结合，已经使理论变成了物质力量。从客观的必然走向了自觉的“自由王国”。就是天津南开区学了哲学的妇女，也收到了破除迷信思想，增强团结，改进街道工作的显著效果。大概最使教条主义者感到恼火的，要算是妇女们用辩证法来解决那些所谓婆婆妈妈的问题了。但生活中充满着矛盾，其中包括这些“婆婆妈妈”的矛盾，而唯物辩证法又是从自然界和社会生活中概括出来的，它完全应该“屈尊”来解决这样的矛盾。列宁就曾教导过我们，不要使科学变成时髦的空谈，而要使它“完全并真正变为生活底组成部分”。工农群众正是这样做了的。他们根本不理睬教条主义者那种玩弄概念的把戏，而使理论变成“生活底组成部分”。何来破坏马克思主义的科学性和系统性之说呢？
    现在是马克思列宁主义理论大普及也是大发展的时代，也是埋葬人类先史时代的时代了。对于工农学习理论的运动，只能叫好，不容怀疑和反对。用有加无已的热忱来帮助工农学好理论，是每个马克思列宁主义者义不容辞的光荣任务。
