　　No Longer Just Working for Myself
　　Li Lizhu
　　On August 1st, we established the "August 1st" production team to fold pages for the Red Flag Binding Factory. In the past, I also folded pages, but because of the burden of housework, I had to work until midnight to fold about a thousand pages a day. Seeing everyone else making a great leap forward, I was also anxious, but I couldn't muster the strength. After the street set up a canteen and a childcare group, these problems were solved. In addition, because we are in collective production, everyone helps each other at work, and my skills have also improved rapidly. Now I can fold six or seven thousand pages a day, which is two or three times more than before.
　　Now, I have become a skilled page-folding worker, and everyone has also elected me as the production team leader. Every day, I am no longer just working for myself or my family, but I am working for the entire country.

　　再不是光为个人劳动了
　　李丽珠
    8月1日，我们成立了“八一”生产组，给红旗装订厂折书页。以前，我也折书页，但因为家务的连累，一天折一千来张，就要忙到深夜十二点。看到人家大跃进，心里也着急，可就是使不上劲。街道办起了食堂、托儿组以后，这些问题都解决了。再加上大家是集体生产，工作时大家互相帮助，我的技术也很快得到提高，现在一天已能折六、七千张，比过去提高两三倍。
    现在，我已成为一个熟练的折页工人，大家还选我当生产组长。每天，我再也不是光为个人，或为我一家人劳累，而是在为整个国家而劳动着。
