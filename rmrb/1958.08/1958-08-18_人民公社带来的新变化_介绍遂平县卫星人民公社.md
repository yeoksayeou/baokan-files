　　New Changes Brought About by the People's Commune
　　——Introducing the Weixing (Satellite) People's Commune in Suiping County
　　Zhao Guang, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Suiping County Committee

　　The Weixing People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan, was formed on April 20th through the merger of twenty-seven agricultural production cooperatives. The entire commune comprises nine thousand three hundred and sixty-nine households, totaling forty-three thousand two hundred and sixty-three people. Since realizing cooperativization, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of commune members have fully utilized the advantages of cooperativization and waged a tenacious struggle against nature, thereby achieving significant growth in agricultural production. The average wheat yield per mu increased from 127 jin last year to 653.3 jin this year. All twenty-seven production brigades in the commune have surpassed the original production and living standards of local well-to-do middle peasants. However, this development of production and increase in output are far from meeting the needs of national industrial construction and the growing demands of the people's livelihood. Based on the victories of continued leaps forward in production, the broad masses of cadres and people have further recognized the infinite potential for increasing production and have put forward the requirement for developing production at an even faster pace. However, due to the small scale of the former agricultural cooperatives, the shortage of labor, and the lack of material resources, contradictions emerged in many aspects that could not adapt to the need to develop production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, the broad masses of cadres and people urgently demanded the merger of the original small cooperatives into larger ones. The county Party committee and the township Party committee promptly grasped this fundamental demand of the broad masses and actively led the masses to quickly carry out the merger of cooperatives. In the short span of over three months since the merger, tremendous achievements have been made in agriculture, industry, water conservancy construction, forestry, animal husbandry, culture, and education.

　　In agricultural production, due to the concentration of efforts on processing and applying fertilizer and eliminating the third-class wheat seedlings after the merger, the astonishing miracle of a more than fourfold increase in wheat production compared to last year emerged, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people. Since most of the autumn crops were uniformly adjusted after the merger based on terrain, soil, water sources, and other conditions, making it possible to fully exploit potential, the autumn seedlings are currently growing well. According to estimates based on the current growth of various crops, the entire commune will achieve a per-mu yield of two thousand jin in the autumn.

　　In industrial production, the plan after the merger was to establish 360 various small factories during the period of the country's second five-year plan. However, because the establishment of the commune fully demonstrated its superiority, it further promoted the ideological liberation of the broad masses and established the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to act. Therefore, in the short span of over three months, the original five-year industrial construction targets were greatly exceeded. According to statistics up to July, the entire commune already had 1,138 factories of various types put into production in twenty-two categories. Iron smelting and the manufacture of ball bearings, which no one dared to imagine in the past, have now begun to be put into production in the Weixing Commune.

　　In water conservancy construction, before the establishment of the commune, only two production brigades could irrigate by gravity flow; now, fifteen production brigades can irrigate by gravity flow.

　　In terms of animal husbandry, grazing was scattered in the past, and there were no centralized grazing pastures at all. After the establishment of the commune, a total of eleven cattle farms, eight sheep farms, fifty-seven pig farms, ten chicken farms, and eight bee farms were established.

　　In commercial work, the entire commune has established twenty supply and marketing outlets with the combination of three cooperatives, and seven agency stores, which greatly facilitates the purchase of production and living materials for the broad masses of commune members.

　　In cultural and educational work, in addition to the nineteen existing public primary schools in the entire commune, with 115 classes and 5,593 students, there is now one commune-run worker-peasant university with ten classes, eight departments, and a total of 7,700 students; one technical secondary school with six classes and 264 students; and thirty-three primary schools with thirty-four classes and 1,680 students. The number of children entering primary school alone reached 93.9% of the total number of school-age children in the entire commune. 96.7% of the illiterates and semi-illiterates in the entire commune have removed the label of illiteracy, and 5,260 people have now transferred to higher primary school classes. In addition, twenty-one libraries, twenty-one clubs, four basketball courts, eighteen singing teams with 540 people, and eight amateur theatrical troupes have been established.

　　In order to protect the safe production of industry and agriculture, the entire commune has also organized a militia force of 2,484 people and established five rocket companies and twenty rocket platoons with 800 people participating as the backbone armed forces of the militia.

　　After the establishment of the commune, production and construction undertakings have developed from basically single agricultural production to a basic unit that closely combines industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs to carry out diverse production. Due to the development and changes in this situation, changes in production relations and changes in the thinking of the broad masses of commune members have also been caused. Therefore, this large commune formed by the merger of small cooperatives is not just an agricultural production cooperative in nature, but a basic social unit jointly composed of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. Therefore, corresponding changes and improvements must be made in the commune's operation and management, distribution system, and so on.

　　First of all, in terms of the commune's system, it is necessary to allocate and use all the means of production and labor within the commune in a unified manner according to the principle of "unified management and decentralized administration," and to place all production and construction matters such as industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and supply and marketing, credit, culture, health, and transportation under the unified management of the commune, and to formulate various production and construction plans and distribute income in a unified manner by the commune. At the same time, since the scale of the commune is very large, the matters managed are numerous, and the distribution is wide, it is necessary to appropriately merge and expand the original production brigades and production teams of the commune according to the needs of various production and construction projects on the basis of the unified management of the commune, and to fully exert the enthusiasm and initiative of organizations at all levels. In terms of management matters and scope, it is also necessary to appropriately divide them according to the principle of being conducive to centralized leadership, unified management, and decentralized administration. At the same time, appropriate adjustments must also be made in organizational structures such as finance, trade, and credit, that is, the commune establishes a supply and marketing department and a credit department. Under the business leadership of state-owned commerce, the supply and marketing department handles the sale of products and the supply of necessities for the entire commune. Under the business guidance of the National Bank, the credit department handles the deposit and loan of commune members and the allocation of funds for the entire commune.

　　Secondly, in terms of the commune's distribution system. In order to promote the great development of production, encourage the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, consolidate and improve the cooperative system, and appropriately improve the lives of commune members under the conditions of rapid production growth and a large increase in accumulation. Therefore, in the income distribution of the commune, according to the distribution system of "distribution according to work," the original distribution method of evaluating work points based on the amount of work done, with two pre-distributions and one final settlement per year, is changed to the implementation of a distribution method of basic wages plus bonuses. That is: Regarding the grain part, the commune unifies and controls it according to the grain ration standards stipulated by the state and the commune's grain production increase, calculates it according to the population, and distributes it to each production team. Each production team issues food ration cards to commune members according to the standard of fixed quantity per person. Commune members eat in the commune cafeteria, and the grain part is taken by the certificate, supplied without price, and the cost of vegetables (oil, salt, etc.) is borne by the commune members themselves. The wage part appropriately grades and determines the amount of fixed wages according to the strength of each commune member's labor, the level of production technology, and the quality of labor attitude. At the same time, the commune allocates a considerable portion of the bonus to conduct monthly and quarterly evaluations and rewards (generally, fixed wages account for 80%, and bonuses account for 20%).

　　Again, strengthen the leadership of the Party, establish and improve the Party organizations at all levels within the commune, and on the basis of the existing Party organizations, appropriately develop and strengthen the Party ranks, appropriately adjust and allocate the cadre forces of organizations at all levels, change leadership methods, and continue to implement the leadership principles of collective leadership of the Party committee and division of labor with individual responsibility. Strengthen the activities of the Party branch, and fully exert the role of all Party members, Communist Youth League members, women, and other organizations. Strengthen the Party's political and ideological work for the broad masses of commune members. Actively cultivate and strengthen the ranks of socialist construction activists who are both red and expert, and actively create conditions in all aspects to strive for accelerating socialist construction and gradually transitioning to the communist system.

　　人民公社带来的新变化
　　——介绍遂平县卫星人民公社
　　中共遂平县委副书记　赵光
    河南遂平县卫星人民公社是由二十七个农业生产合作社，于4月20日合并而成的。全社共有九千三百六十九户，四万三千二百六十三人。自从实现合作化以后，广大社员在党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，充分地发挥了合作化的优越性，向大自然开展了顽强斗争，因而使农业生产量获得很大增长，小麦平均单产由去年的一百二十七斤，今年提高到六百五十三点三斤，全公社二十七个生产大队均已超过当地原来富裕中农的生产和生活水平。但是这种生产的发展和产量的提高还远远不能满足国家工业建设需要和人民生活增长的要求，广大干部、群众在生产继续跃进的胜利基础上，又进一步认识了提高生产的无穷潜力，提出了更高速度发展生产的要求。可是由于过去农业社的规模小，劳力少，物质力量不足等，许多方面出现了不能适应更加多快好省地发展生产需要的矛盾。因此，广大干部和群众迫切要求将原有的小社合并成大社。县委和乡党委及时抓住了广大群众这一根本要求，积极领导群众迅速地进行了并社。并社后短短的三个多月中，在农业、工业、水利建设、林业、牧业、文化教育等方面均取得巨大的成绩。
    在农业生产上，由于并社后集中力量进行加工施肥，消灭小麦三类苗，因而出现今年小麦比去年增产四倍多的惊人奇迹，这就大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众的干劲。由于大部分秋作物是在并社后，根据地形、土壤、水源等条件进行了统一调整，使之更能充分的发挥潜在力，因而，目前秋苗生长良好，根据当前各种作物生长情况估产，全社秋季即可达到亩产双千斤的丰收。
    在工业生产上，并社后的规划，是要在国家第二个五年计划期间内建立各种小型工厂三百六十个。但由于公社建成后，充分显示了它的优越性，这就更加促进了广大群众的思想解放，树立了敢想、敢说、敢做、敢为的共产主义风格，因而，在短短的三个多月中就大大地突破了原订的五年工业建设指标。截至7月份的统计，全社已投入生产的各种厂子共有二十二类、一千一百三十八个。过去谁都不敢想的炼铁、制造滚珠轴承等，目前也在卫星公社开始投入生产。
    在水利建设上，公社未建成前，只有两个生产大队可以自流灌溉，现在已发展到十五个生产大队能够自流浇灌。
    在畜牧业方面，过去都是分散放牧，根本没集中放牧的牧场，公社建成后，共建立了放牧的牛场十一个，羊场八个，猪场五十七个，鸡场十个，蜂场八个。
    在商业工作上，全社共建立了三社合一的供销门市部二十个，代销店七个，大大便利了广大社员对于生产、生活资料的购买。
    在文化教育工作上，全公社除原有公立小学十九处，一百一十五班，学生五千五百九十三人外，现有社办的工农大学一处，分十个班，八个系，共有学生七千七百人；技术中学一处，六班，学生二百六十四人；小学三十三处，三十四班，学生一千六百八十人，仅小学入学的儿童即达到全公社适龄儿童总数的93.9％。全社的文盲和半文盲，已有96.7％摘掉了文盲的帽子，现已转入高小班的五千二百六十人。另外，还举办了图书室二十一处，俱乐部二十一处，篮球场四处，歌咏队十八个，五百四十人，业余剧团八个。
    为了保卫工农业的安全生产，全社又组织了二千四百八十四人的民兵队伍，并建立了有八百人参加的五个火箭连，二十个火箭排，作为民兵中的基干武装。
    公社建立后，在生产和建设事业上，就由原来基本上是单一的农业生产发展到工、农、商、学、兵密切结合的进行多种生产的一个基本单位。由于这种形势的发展变化，也就引起了生产关系上的变化和广大社员思想上的变化。因此，这种由小社合并成的大公社，就不只是农业生产合作社的性质了，而是一个由工农商学兵联合组成的一个基本社会单位。因此，在公社的经营管理和分配制度等等方面，均必须进行相应的改变和提高。
    首先，在公社的体制方面，必须根据“统一经营、分级管理”的原则，将社内的一切生产资料和劳力归公社统一调配和使用，工、农、林、牧、副和供销、信用、文化、卫生、交通等一切生产建设事项归公社统一经营，由公社统一制定各项生产建设计划和进行收益分配。同时，由于公社的规模很大，经营的事项多，分布广，因此，必须在公社统一经营的基础上，根据各种生产建设的需要，将公社原有的生产大队和生产小队适当地合并扩大，并充分发挥各级组织的积极主动性。在管理事项和范围方面，也必须根据有利于集中领导、统一经营、分级管理的原则来适当地加以划分。同时，在财贸、信用等组织机构方面也必须进行适当的调整，即由公社建立供销部和信用部。供销部在国营商业的业务领导下，办理全社的产品销售与必需品的供应。信用部在国家银行的业务指导下，办理社员存款、贷款和全社资金的调剂等工作。
    其次，在公社的分配制度方面。为了促进生产的大发展，鼓舞广大社员的劳动积极性，巩固与提高合作化制度，并在生产迅速增长、积累大量增加的条件下，适当改善社员生活。因此，在公社的收益分配上，按照“按劳取酬”的分配制度，由原来按出工多少评工记分，一年二次预分、一次决算的分配办法，改为实行基本工资加奖励的分配办法。即：关于粮食部分，社内根据国家规定的口粮标准和社内粮食增产情况，按人口计算，由社统一掌握，分发各生产队，各生产队按以人定量标准发给社员食粮证，社员在公社食堂用饭，粮食部分凭证取饭，无价供应，菜金（油盐等）由社员自负。工资部分，根据每个社员的劳力强弱、生产技术高低、劳动态度好坏等条件，适当分级确定固定工资的数额。同时，公社再拿出相当部分的奖励费，按月按季进行评比奖励（一般是固定工资占80％，奖励费占20％）。
    再次，加强党的领导，建立和健全公社内各级党的组织，并在现有党的组织基础上，再适当地发展壮大党的队伍，适当地调整配备各级组织的干部力量，改变领导方法，继续贯彻党委集体领导和分工负责制的领导原则。加强党支部的活动，充分发挥全体党员和共青团员、妇女等各个组织的作用。加强党对广大社员的政治思想工作。积极培养壮大又红又专的社会主义建设积极分子队伍，从各方面积极创造条件，为加速社会主义建设和逐步向共产主义制度过渡而奋斗。
