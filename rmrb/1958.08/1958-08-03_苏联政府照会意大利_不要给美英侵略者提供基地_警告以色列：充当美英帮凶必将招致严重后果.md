Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, Moscow dispatch from TASS, August 2nd: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin handed Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stefano a note on August 1st, calling on the Italian government to take effective measures to prevent Italian territory from being used to aggress against Arab peoples who are fighting for their national independence and freedom.
    The note pointed out that since the United States and Britain's armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, Italian territory has become one of the strongholds for the American command to dispatch troops to these countries. Naples, Taranto, and Genoa have been used by the US Navy as bases for preparing and implementing the US military's landing in Lebanon. American planes have continuously transported American troops from West Germany to the Capodichino Airport near Naples, and immediately from there to the Middle East.
    The note said that based on these facts, it is entirely possible to judge that Italy, due to its participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, is linked with such North Atlantic Treaty participants who attempt to use force to impose on the Arab people a system they oppose. In this way, Italy has in fact embarked on the road of being an accomplice to military adventurers.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, Moscow dispatch from TASS: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin handed Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union Avida a note on August 1st, drawing the attention of the Israeli government to the fact that Israeli airspace is being widely used to transport British invading forces to Jordan and to conduct "shows of force."
    The Soviet note said that this attitude of the Israeli government makes Israel a direct accomplice to the US and British aggression against the people of Lebanon, Jordan, and other Arab countries.
    To this end, the Soviet government declares that the Israeli government must be held responsible for the aggravation of the tense situation in the Middle East, which may develop into a conflict that brings very dangerous consequences to Israel's own national interests.

    苏联政府照会意大利
    不要给美英侵略者提供基地
    警告以色列：充当美英帮凶必将招致严重后果
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：苏联外交部副部长佐林1日交给意大利驻苏联大使斯蒂芬诺一份照会，呼吁意大利政府采取有效措施，使意大利领土不致被利用来侵略为自己民族独立和自由而斗争的阿拉伯人民。
    照会中指出，自从美国和英国武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦以来，意大利领土成了美国指挥部调遣部队到这些国家去的据点之一。那不勒斯、大兰多、热那亚被美国海军作为准备和实现美军在黎巴嫩登陆的基地。美国飞机源源不断地把美国军队从西德运到那不勒斯附近的卡波迪基诺机场，并立即从那里开往中近东。
    照会说，根据这些事实完全可以判断，意大利由于参加了北大西洋公约，而和这样一些北大西洋公约参加国联结在一起，这些国家企图用武力强使阿拉伯人民接受他们所反对的制度。这样一来，意大利实际上就走上了做军事冒险家的帮凶的道路。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长佐林在1日把一份照会交给以色列驻苏联大使阿维达，提请以色列政府注意以色列的领空正在被广泛地用来运送英国侵略军到约旦和用来进行“武力示威”。
    苏联照会中说，以色列政府的这种态度使以色列成为美英对黎巴嫩、约旦和其他阿拉伯国家人民进行侵略活动的直接帮凶。
    为此，苏联政府声明，以色列政府要对中近东紧张局势的加剧负责，这种紧张局势可能发展成为给以色列本身的民族利益带来非常危险的后果的冲突。
