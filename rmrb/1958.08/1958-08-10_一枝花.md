    A Single Flower
    In the past twenty-odd days, more than 1,000 faculty and students from Beijing Normal University, with the assistance of factories and agricultural cooperatives, have established 141 schools. They have achieved a situation where every class runs a school and everyone acts as a teacher. This is a path to cultivate educational workers for the working class based on their own characteristics.
    There are various forms of teaching reform and integrating theory with practice. Some specialized and engineering schools have established many factories based on their own characteristics; agricultural colleges have established farms; commercial schools have partnered with department stores, and so on. The result is all for one purpose: to cultivate socialist construction talents who are both red and expert.
    In the garden of teaching reform and integrating theory with practice, Beijing Normal University, based on its own characteristics, took the mass line, adopted the "three-way combination" method, and blossomed a single flower by establishing schools in factories and agricultural cooperatives. In the process of running schools, they acted as both teachers and students, participated in productive labor, and transformed their thinking. In turn, this enabled teaching to be better integrated with production practice. In this way, teachers and students received practical training, and the broad masses of working people improved their cultural, scientific, and technological level.
    Let all kinds of flowers blooming in the teaching reforms of Beijing Normal University and other institutions of higher learning compete for beauty!

    一枝花
    北京师范大学一千多师生在最近二十多天里，在工厂、农业社的协助下，已经办起了一百四十一所学校。他们做到了班班办学校，人人当教师。这是根据自己特点培养工人阶级教育工作者的道路。
    教学改革、理论联系实际，有各种各样的形式，有些专科、工科学校根据自己特点办了许多工厂；农学院办了农场；商业学校同百货公司挂钩等等。其结果都是为了一个目的：培养又红又专的社会主义建设人材。
    北京师范大学在教学改革、理论联系实际的百花园地里，根据自己的特点走群众路线，采取“三结合”办法，又开出了在工厂、农业社办学校的鲜花。他们在办学过程中，一面当教员，一面当学生，参加生产劳动，改造思想。反过来又使教学更好地结合生产实际。这样，师生得到了实际锻炼，广大劳动人民提高了文化科学技术水平。
    让北京师范大学和其他高等院校在教学改革中开放的各种鲜花争艳吧！
