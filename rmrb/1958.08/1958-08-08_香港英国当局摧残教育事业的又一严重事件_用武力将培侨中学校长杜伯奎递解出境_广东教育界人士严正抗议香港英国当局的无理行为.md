Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th - Hong Kong British authorities deported Du Bo-Kui, the principal of Hong Kong's Peiqiao Middle School, early on the 6th. People believe this is a serious incident of the Hong Kong British authorities persecuting Hong Kong's education.

At 7:20 AM on the 6th, a large number of Hong Kong British police first deployed around Peiqiao Middle School. Then, officials from the Hong Kong British Education Department and plainclothes police intruded into Principal Du Bo-Kui's bedroom, read out the Hong Kong British authorities' so-called "deportation order" to Du Bo-Kui, and at 8:00 AM, more than twenty plainclothes police escorted Du Bo-Kui onto a police car and forced him to leave Hong Kong.

Prior to this, the Hong Kong British authorities had carried out many persecutions against this school, which has a twelve-year history, and Du Bo-Kui, who had served as principal for ten years. On April 18th of this year, the Hong Kong British Education Department's inspection unit sent personnel to search the school's library and remove some books. On May 13th and 14th, Mao Qin, the acting director of education in Hong Kong, sent two consecutive letters to the school board of Peiqiao Middle School. The letters used the school library's collection of so-called "political" books and the so-called entry of teachers and students from other schools into Peiqiao Middle School as excuses, insisting that Peiqiao Middle School's activities were of a "political nature" and "poorly managed." Therefore, the school was required to report the names and addresses of all teachers and students to the British Education Department within a week. Finally, it unreasonably set a deadline for the school's board members to sign a pre-determined guarantee at the Hong Kong British Education Department. The school authorities immediately rejected this unreasonable accusation and absurd demand from the Hong Kong British authorities. On July 24th, the Hong Kong British Executive Council wrote to the supervisor of Peiqiao Middle School, stating that it wanted to revoke Principal Du Bo-Kui's registration as school supervisor and teacher. On August 5th, the Hong Kong British Executive Council convened a meeting to hear the explanation of Principal Du Bo-Kui's representative lawyer. The meeting adjourned without making a decision on the spot. The next morning, the Hong Kong British authorities unreasonably deported Principal Du Bo-Kui.

The Hong Kong British authorities' measure taken on the morning of the 6th to persecute Hong Kong's education has aroused the anger of teachers, students, parents, and Hong Kong educators. Many people pointed out to reporters that the Hong Kong British authorities' deportation of Du Bo-Kui is a planned persecution of Hong Kong's education. The revised education ordinance passed by the Hong Kong British authorities at the beginning of this year, despite the solemn protests of the Hong Kong education community, was to prepare for undermining Hong Kong's education. After the passage of this ordinance, the Hong Kong British Education Department carried out many persecutions of Hong Kong's education. For example, persecuting several literacy classes and interfering with the raising of the national flag in Hong Kong schools. Today, they have forced Peiqiao Middle School Principal Du Bo-Kui to leave Hong Kong, which is an even more serious incident of the Hong Kong British authorities persecuting Hong Kong's education. Teachers, students, parents, and many educators at Peiqiao Middle School have expressed strong protests against this unreasonable action by the Hong Kong British authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th - More than two hundred educators in Guangdong Province gathered today to solemnly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable deportation of Du Bo-Kui, the principal of Hong Kong Peiqiao Middle School, and their deliberate action to undermine Hong Kong's Chinese education.

With his hair already gray, Du Bo-Kui, the principal of Hong Kong Peiqiao Middle School, indignantly denounced the persecution he had suffered at the hands of the Hong Kong British authorities at the meeting. He said: "Yesterday morning, when two British plainclothes police officers dragged me downstairs into a police car and forced me to leave the country, I questioned them: I have not committed any crime, why should I leave the country? The British official said that the reason was very simple, 'The Governor of Hong Kong does not like you.'" Du Bo-Kui then took out the "deportation ticket" from the Hong Kong British authorities from his pocket and said: "I have been engaged in education in Hong Kong for more than ten years. What crime is it to cultivate students! This 'deportation ticket' is proof of British imperialism undermining the education of our compatriots and persecuting me. This time, the British authorities' persecution is by no means against me personally, but a signal of an attack on progressive education in Hong Kong."

Xu Chongqing, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Education Trade Union, president of Zhongshan University, and a famous veteran educator in our country, attended the protest meeting despite his illness. He said that the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of the education of Hong Kong compatriots is planned. At the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong British authorities disregarded the solemn protests of the Hong Kong education community and created the so-called "revised education ordinance." Then, based on this reactionary ordinance, they further unreasonably interfered with schools raising our national flag, stipulating that schools are not allowed to use textbooks published in our country, but only reactionary textbooks from the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group. Under the pretext of so-called politics, they unreasonably interfered with schools conducting patriotic education and socialist education for students, but allowed the United States Information Service to send "telegrams" to schools for reactionary political propaganda. He said: We solemnly warn the British authorities: The Chinese people have every right to run schools in Hong Kong and have every right to conduct socialist and patriotic education for their children. The Hong Kong British authorities must respect this right.

The teachers who attended the protest meeting unanimously angrily denounced the Hong Kong British authorities' provocative behavior and demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately stop persecuting progressive education in Hong Kong.

    香港英国当局摧残教育事业的又一严重事件
    用武力将培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境
    广东教育界人士严正抗议香港英国当局的无理行为
    新华社香港7日电  香港英国当局6日早晨派出便衣警察，将香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境。人们认为，这是香港英国当局迫害香港教育事业的一个严重事件。
    6日早晨7时20分，大批香港英国警察先在培侨中学附近布防，接着，香港英国教育司的官员和便衣警察就侵入校长杜伯奎卧室，向杜伯奎宣读了香港英国当局的所谓“递解令”，八时，二十多个便衣警察就把杜伯奎押上警车，并且强迫他离开香港。
    在这以前，香港英国当局对这所有十二年历史的学校和担任了十年校长职务的杜伯奎进行了许多迫害。今年4月18日，香港英国教育司署视学处就派出人员到这所学校的图书馆进行搜查，并且取去一部分图书。5月13日和14日，香港代理教育司毛勤连续发了两封信给培侨中学的校董，信内以学校图书馆藏有所谓“政治性”书籍以及有所谓外校教师和学生进入培侨中学为借口，硬说培侨中学的活动有“政治性质”和“管理不完善”，因此要学校在一周内将所有教员和学生的名单和住址报告给英国教育司，最后更无理地限定时间要学校的各校董到香港英国教育司签署一项已经规定好的保证书。学校当局当即拒绝了香港英国当局这一无理的指责和荒谬的要求。7月24日，香港英国行政局写信给培侨中学的监督，表示要取消校长杜伯奎所担任的学校监督以及教师的注册。8月5日，香港英国行政局召开会议，听取培侨中学校长杜伯奎代表律师的解释，这个会议没有当场作出决定就宣布休会。次日早晨，香港英国当局就无理地将校长杜伯奎递解境出。
    香港英国当局6日早晨采取的这个迫害香港教育事业的措施，引起了培侨中学的教师、学生、家长和香港教育界人士的愤怒，许多人向记者指出，香港英国当局将杜伯奎递解出境是对香港教育事业进行有计划的迫害。今年初香港英国当局不顾香港教育界的严正抗议而通过的修正教育条例，就是为摧残香港教育事业作准备。这个条例通过后，香港英国教育司就对香港教育事业进行了许多迫害。例如迫害几个识字班以及干涉香港的学校悬挂国旗。今天又强迫培侨中学校长杜伯奎离开香港，更是香港英国当局迫害香港教育事业的一个严重事件。培侨中学的教师、学生、家长和许多教育界人士对香港英国当局的这一无理行动都表示严重抗议。
    新华社广州7日电  广东省的二百多名教育工作者今天集会严重抗议香港英国当局无理地将香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境、蓄意摧残香港中国教育事业的行动。
    头发已经花白的香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎激愤地在会上控诉了香港英国当局迫害他的经过。他说：“昨天早晨，两个英籍便衣警察抓我下楼到警车里迫我出境时，我曾质问他们：我没有犯罪，为什么要出境？英国官员说，理由很简单，‘港督不喜欢你’”，杜伯奎接着从衣袋里拿出香港英国当局的那张“解票”说：“我在香港办了十多年教育，培养学生有什么罪！这张‘解票’就是英帝国主义摧残我国同胞教育事业和迫害我的证据。这一次英国当局绝不是对我个人的迫害，而是向香港进步教育事业进攻的信号。”
    广东省教育工会主席、中山大学校长、我国著名的老教育家许崇清带病出席了抗议大会。他说，香港英国当局对香港同胞的教育事业的迫害是有计划的。今年初，香港英国当局不顾香港教育界的严正抗议，制造了所谓“修正教育条例”，接着并进一步根据这个反动条例无理地干涉学校悬挂我国国旗，规定学校不准使用我国出版的课本，只准使用台湾蒋介石集团的反动课本，借口所谓政治性，无理干涉学校对学生进行爱国主义教育和社会主义教育，但却允许美国新闻处向学校投寄“电讯稿”进行反动的政治宣传。他说：我们严正警告英国当局：中国人民完全有权利在香港开办学校，完全有权利向自己的子弟进行社会主义和爱国主义教育。香港英国当局必须尊重这种权利。
    出席抗议集会的教师们在发言中一致愤怒地斥责香港英国当局的挑衅行为，要求香港英国当局立即停止迫害香港的进步教育事业。
