    Sh棉 County's Asbestos is World-Class
    After more than a year of exploration by the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Geology, it has been proven that the asbestos mine in Sh棉 County, Sichuan Province, is the largest and best in China in terms of reserves and quality, and it is also a rare large asbestos deposit in the world.
    The large asbestos deposits in the Jianshibao, Zongjiaping, Daping, Haiziping, and Wujiaman mining areas within Sh棉 County have veins extending more than 6,300 meters, with a width of over 350 meters, and reserves of up to 28 million tons. The average grade of the ore is above 2%; the fiber length is also rare in the world, with most fibers reaching tens of centimeters in length, and recently, large asbestos fibers of 180 centimeters in length have also appeared.
    The asbestos in Sh棉 County not only has large reserves and long fibers, but also has special asbestos varieties. For example, the discovered blue asbestos and amphibole asbestos are not only heat-resistant, but also have high acid and alkali resistance. According to the test results of Chongqing Plastics Factory, the acid resistance of amphibole asbestos mined from the Xiyoufang mining area in Sh棉 County reaches over 90%. This kind of highly acid-resistant asbestos is also rare in the world.

　　石棉县的石绵世界少有
    经过四川省地质局一年多的勘探证明，四川省石棉县的石绵矿，在藏量和质量方面都是我国目前最大最好的一个，在世界上也是罕有的大石绵矿床。
    石棉县境内尖石包、宗家坪、大坪、孩子坪和吴家漫等矿区的大石绵矿床，矿脉延伸六千三百多公尺，宽达三百五十多公尺，藏量可达二千八百多万吨。矿的品位平均在2％以上；纤维长度也是世界少有的，大部分纤维长达几十公分，最近还出现了一百八十公分长的大石绵。
    石棉县的石绵不但藏量大，纤维长，还有特殊石绵品种。例如，已发现的蓝石绵和角闪石石绵，不仅耐温，而且还有高度的耐酸耐腐性能。据重庆市塑料厂使用化验结果证明，石棉县西油房矿区开采出的角闪石石绵耐酸度达到90％以上。这种高度耐酸的石绵世界上也是少有的。
