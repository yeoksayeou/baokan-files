    Not Allowing the Tragedy of Thirteen Years Ago to Repeat Itself
    400,000 People in Hiroshima Mourn Atomic Bomb Victims
    Nearly 400,000 citizens of Hiroshima held various activities from morning till night.
    At 8:15 AM—the moment when Hiroshima City was bombed by the American atomic bomb thirteen years ago—all the city's sirens and bells sounded in unison, and residents observed a minute of silence for those who died in the atomic bomb disaster.
    50,000 people held a memorial service in front of the Atomic Bomb Victims Memorial Tower in Nakajima Peace Memorial Park. The names of 173 people who died from the atomic bomb disaster in the year from August 6 last year to the present were added to the list on the memorial tower.
    Hiroshima Mayor Tadao Watanabe read a peace declaration at the memorial service. The declaration stated that the atomic bombing tragedy that occurred thirteen years ago was an unprecedented unfortunate event in human history, and the lives of Hiroshima citizens who suffered the bombing are still threatened. The declaration said, we must build Hiroshima into a city symbolizing humanity's lasting peace. Today, while mourning the victims resting in peace, we are even more determined to fight for peace.
    The declaration emphasized that currently, the public opinion demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs is rising higher and higher, making people feel that a bright future has appeared. We must further shout loudly and promote public opinion in order to achieve a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons, and save mankind from the crisis of extinction.
    The Hiroshima Conference of the Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament was also held this morning at the Hiroshima City Public Hall. Participating in the conference were twelve representatives from ten countries and about two thousand citizen representatives. The meeting discussed issues such as "prohibiting atomic and hydrogen bombs," "opposing arming Japan with nuclear weapons," and "changing the Atomic Bomb Victims Medical Treatment Law to the Atomic Bomb Victims Relief Law."
    Today, 1,500 elementary and middle school students in Hiroshima held a youth rally for peace in front of the Atomic Bomb Victims Children's Monument, mourning the Japanese children who died in the American atomic bomb disaster, and issued a strong call for the children's hope for world peace.
    In the evening, lanterns were released on the Hon-An and Hon-kawa rivers, which flow through the central area of the atomic bomb explosion, to mourn the people who died in the atomic bomb disaster.
    On August 5th, Hiroshima citizens also received a message of greeting from American peace activists, including Bigelow, who were arrested and imprisoned by the American reactionaries for sailing on the "Golden Rule" to Eniwetok Atoll to prevent the United States from testing nuclear weapons.

    不许十三年前的悲剧重现
    广岛四十万人悼念原子弹牺牲者
    广岛近四十万市民从早到晚举行各种活动。
    上午八点十五分——十三年前广岛市遭受美国原子弹轰炸的时刻，全市汽笛和钟声齐鸣，居民为死于原子弹灾害的人默哀一分钟。
    五万人在中岛和平纪念公园的原子弹牺牲者慰灵塔前举行了追悼会。从去年8月6日到现在为止一年中，由于受到原子弹灾害而死亡的一百七十三人的名单被添入慰灵塔上的名单中。
    广岛市长渡边忠雄在追悼会上宣读了和平宣言。宣言说，十三年前发生的原子弹轰炸悲剧是人类历史上空前不幸的事件，遭受过轰炸的广岛市民的生命现在仍然受到威胁。宣言说，我们要把广岛建设成为象征着人类永久和平的城市。今天，在吊念长眠地下的牺牲者的同时，更加坚定了争取和平的信念。
    宣言强调说，目前，要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的舆论越来越高涨，使人感到前途已经出现了光明。我们必须进一步大声疾呼，推动舆论，以便实现全面地禁止制造和使用核武器，把人类从灭亡的危机中拯救出来。
    第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会广岛大会也在今天上午在广岛市公会堂举行。参加大会的有十个国家的十二个代表和市民代表约二千人。会上讨论了“禁止原子弹和氢弹”、“反对用核武器武装日本”、“把原子受害者医疗法改为原子弹受害者救济法”等问题。
    广岛市的一千五百名小学生和中学生今天在原子弹受害儿童碑前面举行了祈求和平的青少年集会，悼念在美国原子弹灾难下牺牲的日本儿童，并且发出了孩子们希望世界和平的强烈呼声。
    晚上，在流过原子弹爆炸中心地区的本安和本川的河里放河灯，吊念死于原子弹灾难的人们。
    8月5日，广岛市民还接到了由于乘“金律号”船到恩纳威托克岛阻止美国试验核武器而遭受美国反动当局逮捕入狱的美国和平战士比格劳等人的问候电。
