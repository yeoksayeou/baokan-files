Raising Political Awareness, Doing a Good Job in Street Work
Tianjin Housewives Study Philosophy
    (Our report) Tianjin Municipality, Nankai District, Ximen South Street, San Daoqiao residential area's housewives have organized a philosophy study group and begun to study philosophy.
    This study group developed from a literacy group composed of ten housewives. After they learned cultural knowledge, they began to study general science knowledge in April of this year. In July, influenced by workers studying philosophy, they began to study philosophy. Now, they have had two lessons, learning the basic knowledge of philosophy, and have held more than ten discussions. Those participating in the study are very enthusiastic, and the number of people is constantly increasing, from the original ten to twenty-six.
    Through preliminary study, the housewives have initially understood the fundamental boundary between materialism and idealism. Yang Fenglan, a worker's family member, used to be superstitious and afraid to go out at night, and even asked a fortune teller to tell her fortune. After the fortune teller told her that her family was "犯苛" (incurring harshness), she was uneasy, pessimistic, and disappointed day and night, and did no needlework for a year. After studying philosophy, she suddenly realized and said to others: "Idealism has made me suffer a lot, and I will never be superstitious again."
    After studying philosophy, the housewives also initially understood the correct relationship between the objective and the subjective, which promoted the development of street work. In the past, there were many opinions from the masses when the street selected "Five-Good" activists. After studying philosophy, the housewives participating in street work realized that this was due to making subjectivist mistakes. Later, when evaluating "Five-Good" activists, they went deep into households to conduct investigations and research, and listened to the opinions of the masses, and as a result, the masses responded very well. In the past, when running street factories and other undertakings, some people always emphasized objective difficulties. Now, after learning the relationship between the objective and the subjective, they believe that they should give play to subjective initiative and transform objective conditions, criticized the idea of emphasizing objective difficulties, and in a short period of time, they established waste product processing, sewing cooperatives, primary schools, kindergartens, etc.

### 提高政治觉悟　做好街道工作　天津家庭妇女学哲学

　　提高政治觉悟　做好街道工作
　　天津家庭妇女学哲学
    本报讯　天津市南开区西门南街三道桥居民区的家庭妇女，组织了哲学学习小组，开始学习哲学。
    这个学习小组，是由十个家庭妇女组成的扫盲小组发展起来的。她们学习了文化知识以后，在今年4月开始学习一般科学知识。7月间，在工人学习哲学的影响下，开始学习哲学。现在，已经上了两次课，学习哲学的基本知识，并讨论了十几次。参加学习的人学习情绪很高，而且人数不断增加，已由原来的十人增加到二十六人。
    经过初步学习，家庭妇女们初步了解了唯物主义与唯心主义的根本界限。工人家属杨凤兰过去迷信鬼神，黑夜不敢出门，还叫算命的给她算卦。当算命的人告诉她一家人“犯苛”以后，她日夜情绪不安，悲观失望，一年没有做针线活。学哲学后，她恍然大悟地对别人说：
  “唯心主义可把我害苦了，以后决不再迷信。”
    家庭妇女学习哲学以后，还初步懂得了客观与主观的正确关系，推动了街道工作的开展。过去街道评选“五好”积极分子时，群众意见很大。参加街道工作的家庭妇女学习了哲学以后，认识到这是由于犯了主观主义的毛病。以后评“五好”积极分子时，她们就深入到户，进行调查研究，听取群众意见，结果群众反映很好。过去在街道办工厂和其他事业的时候，有些人总强调客观困难。现在学了客观和主观的关系以后，认为应当发挥主观能动性，改造客观条件，批判了强调客观困难的思想，短期内就办了废品加工、缝纫社及小学、幼儿园等。
