Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 17th: The Iraqi cabinet decided on the 16th to hand over half of the former royal property to the Ministry of Social Affairs to help the poor, and the other half will be used to complete social reform plans urgently needed by the government.

The cabinet also decided to dismiss twelve British experts employed by the Iraqi Railway Department.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 18th: Iraqi Minister of National Guidance, Shangshal, said on the 17th that the Iraqi government, together with the people and the army, is raising vigilance to guard against secret conspiracies.

In a radio address broadcast on Baghdad Radio, Shangshal said that Iraq has extended a friendly hand to the people of the world, because we believe that the people of the world want peace and hate war. We hope to have mutual understanding and establish friendly relations with our neighbors Iran and Turkey on the basis of non-aggression.

He said that the Iraqi government has invited the Soviet Union, China, Eastern European countries and Yugoslavia to hold negotiations in order to resume trade with them. We also hope to establish relations with other Eastern and Western countries on the basis of mutual benefit and in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

Shangshal said that we hope to realize the interests of our people, which are consistent with the interests of all Arab countries. He pointed out that Iraq used to be the center of conspiracies against peace. "Now we have eliminated the dangerous conspiracies of those agents. Those who corrupted the regime will be sanctioned by law."

In another speech delivered on the same evening, Shangshal said that Iraq had lost a large amount of national wealth in the past. We must now stop this loss and strive for prosperity, freedom and democracy. He said that our nation is part of the entire Arab nation, and we must unite to strive for the peace of the Arab world.
