Three Generations of Grandparents and Grandchildren Compete

　　Under the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, Liang Xunwen, deputy director of the Jianxin No. 1 Cooperative in Echeng County, Hubei, thought to himself: I am a Communist Party member and a model for high-yield rice production. This year, I must strive to go to the next level and create an outstanding high-yield experimental field.

　　His father, Liang Rubi, seeing that his son was taking the lead in setting up experimental fields, was unwilling to be outdone. First, he wanted to compete with everyone, and second, he wanted to bring glory to the whole family, so he also set up an eight-tenths-mu high-yield experimental field. Liang Xunwen's daughter, Liang Shaoying, saw that her grandfather and father were both setting up experimental fields, and wanted to compete with her grandfather and father. The three generations of grandparents and grandchildren all put up signs by their experimental fields, stating their targets and methods, and held a family meeting to propose competition with each other and strive for family glory.

　　They all carefully cultivated their own experimental fields. The old grandfather found a few seedlings missing in his field. Unable to find seedlings locally to fill the gaps, he ran several miles away to find a few seedlings to plant in his field. In order to ensure frequent irrigation and shallow irrigation to prevent rice lodging, Liang Xunwen guarded the field day and night from heading to maturity. Liang Shaoying also always stayed close to her experimental field after returning home from school every day. When applying fertilizer, others said that she had applied too much. She ran to her father's field to take a look and found that her father's field had even more fertilizer than her own, and the rice was growing particularly well, so she felt relieved.

　　One day, Liang Shaoying came home from school and saw that the rice in her field was growing worse than her grandfather's. Unable to find the reason, she came back and asked her father: "Why is the rice in my field growing worse than the rice in my grandfather's field? What should I do?" Her grandfather, who had returned from herding cattle, happened to overhear and chimed in, "Hey! Your rice is a little worse than mine, isn't it!" Liang Shaoying was so angry that she pouted and remained silent. Her father said with a smile on his face, "It's okay if it's a little worse, otherwise how can we show the three generations of grandparents and grandchildren!" Before he finished speaking, Liang Shaoying ran away in anger. She ran to the township general branch secretary and explained the reason. The general branch secretary, Chen Jinfu, told her: apply a few more pounds of chemical fertilizer and kill the insects once. Liang Shaoying did everything as instructed, and as a result, the grain quickly caught up with her grandfather's.

　　They competed with each other and also helped each other. Once, Liang Xunwen visited other people's grain and found that the three generations of grandparents and grandchildren had applied too much nitrogen fertilizer, and the seedlings were growing wildly, and there was a danger of lodging. So he held a family meeting in a timely manner, analyzed the reasons for the rampant growth, and decided to take measures to dig ditches and dry the fields to inhibit the rampant growth of the seedlings. In a few days, the seedlings indeed returned to normal.

　　During the harvest, these three experimental fields were harvested and threshed separately. The results of the acceptance test were: Liang Xunwen's experimental field yielded 2,522 jin per mu, winning first place; Liang Shaoying's yielded 2,064 jin per mu, winning second place; and grandfather came in third.

　　Now the competition among the three generations of grandparents and grandchildren is still continuing, and the grandfather is preparing to strive for first place in the late rice experimental field. 　　　　　　　Zhang Zemin

　　祖孙三代竞赛
    在农业生产大跃进的新形势下，湖北鄂城县建新一社副主任梁勋文心想：自己是共产党员，又是水稻丰产模范。今年一定要争取更上一层楼，搞一块出色的丰产试验田。
    他父亲梁如必见儿子带头搞试验田，也不甘示弱，一来要与大家比比看，二来也为全家争点光荣，也搞了八分地的高额丰产试验田。梁勋文的女儿梁少英看到爷爷、爸爸都在搞试验田，要与爷爷、爸爸比一比。祖孙三人都在自己的试验田边插上牌子，写明指标和办法，并且开了家庭会，相互提出竞赛，争取全家光荣。
    他们每人都细心地培育着自己的试验田。老爷爷田里缺了几棵秧，本地弄不到秧补，便跑到几里路外谋了几棵秧补在自己田里。梁勋文为了作到勤灌水，浅灌水，防止稻谷倒伏，从抽穗到黄熟，日日夜夜都在田边守护着。梁少英每天放学回家也总不离开她的试验田。追肥时，别人说她追多了，她就跑到她父亲田里去看，发现父亲田里比自己田里追的肥还多，稻子长得特别好，她这才放了心。
    有一天，梁少英放学回家，看到她田里稻子比爷爷的长得差，找不出原因，回来便问爸爸：“我田里稻子为什么比爷爷田里长得差？怎么办？”爷爷放牛回来正碰着了，便插嘴说：“嗨！你的稻子比我的差点吧！”一下把梁少英气的翘起嘴巴不吭声了。爸爸带着满面笑容说：“差点算了，不然怎能显出祖孙三代呢！”话音未落，梁少英却气跑了。她跑到乡总支书记那里去，说明原因，总支书记陈近发告诉她：再下几斤化肥吧，杀次虫。梁少英回来后都照办了，结果谷子很快就赶过她爷爷的。
    他们互相竞赛，也互相帮助。有一次，梁勋文参观别人谷子回来，发现祖孙三人的谷子氮肥追的过多，禾苗疯长，眼看有倒伏的危险。于是他及时召开家庭会，分析了疯长原因，决定采取挖沟晒田的措施，抑制禾苗疯长。不几天，秧苗果然转变正常了。
    收割时，这三块试验田分别进行单收、单打，验收结果是：梁勋文的试验田亩产二千五百二十二斤，得第一名；梁少英的亩产二千零六十四斤，得第二名；爷爷第三名。
    现在祖孙三代的竞赛还在继续，爷爷准备在晚稻试验田上力争第一。　　　　　　　张泽民
