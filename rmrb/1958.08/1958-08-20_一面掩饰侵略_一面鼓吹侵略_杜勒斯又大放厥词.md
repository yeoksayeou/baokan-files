Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on foreign policy on the 18th at the convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In this speech, he shamelessly defended America's global policy of aggression, particularly its armed aggression against the Middle East.

Dulles slanderously accused the Soviet Union, which has consistently striven to defend world peace, of "attempting to dominate the world" and engaging in "threats of force" for "political purposes," while the United States, with a series of shameful records of aggression, had "long abandoned the use of force or the threat of force to achieve expansionist goals." Proceeding from this logic that reverses black and white, Dulles emphasized that the United States must continue to stubbornly implement its fire-playing policy of preparing for nuclear war and must try to make all countries in the Western world allow the United States to lead them by the nose, "maintaining the strength and will to retaliate against the Soviet Union."

Dulles made it clear that while implementing this policy, the United States would interfere in the internal affairs of other countries at all costs, acting as a world policeman. He said, "I know that some people think it is reckless if the United States regards the peace and security of other countries as our own peace. History teaches us that it is reckless not to do so."

Dulles then went on at length to justify the U.S. armed aggression in the Middle East, insisting that the United States sent troops into Lebanon to prevent the threat of so-called "indirect aggression."

Dulles threatened the United Nations to "deal with" the problem of "indirect aggression," and demanded that the United Nations serve as a tool of U.S. policy in order to legitimize U.S. aggression. He demanded: First, mobilize public opinion to oppose what the United States calls "indirect aggression." Second, a "United Nations force" must be established to carry out the kind of tasks that the U.S. military is carrying out in Lebanon at any time. Third, the United Nations should monitor radio broadcasts "condemning propaganda inciting civil war." Dulles stated that the United States would withdraw its troops occupying Lebanon only after the "United Nations" took over and considered the U.S. troops no longer necessary. This shows that the U.S. military will continue to occupy Lebanon for a long time, rather than withdraw immediately.

### 一面掩饰侵略  一面鼓吹侵略　杜勒斯又大放厥词

　　一面掩饰侵略  一面鼓吹侵略
　　杜勒斯又大放厥词
    据新华社19日讯  纽约消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯18日在美国国外战争退伍军人协会大会上发表关于外交政策的演说。他在这篇演说中为美国的全球侵略政策，特别是对中东的武装侵略进行了无耻的狡辩。
    杜勒斯诬蔑一贯为保卫世界和平而奋斗的苏联“企图统治世界”，为了“政治目的”进行“武力威胁”，而有着一系列可耻的侵略纪录的美国倒是“早已经放弃使用武力或用武力威胁来达到扩张的目的”。从这个颠倒黑白的逻辑出发，杜勒斯强调美国必须继续顽固地执行准备核战争的玩火政策，并且要设法使西方世界各国听任美国牵着鼻子走，“保持对苏联进行报复的力量和意志”。
    杜勒斯表明，在执行这种政策的同时，美国将不顾一切地干涉别国的内政，充当世界宪兵的角色。他说，“我知道，某些人认为，如果美国把其他国家的和平和安全看作是我们自己的和平的话，这是轻率的。历史教导我们，不这样做是轻率的。”
    杜勒斯接着长篇大论地为美国在中东的武装侵略行动进行辩解，一口咬定美国派军队侵入黎巴嫩是为了防止所谓“间接侵略”的威胁。
    杜勒斯要挟联合国“必须处理”“间接侵略”的问题，要联合国充当美国政策的工具，以便使美国的侵略合法化。他要求：第一，动员舆论来反对美国所说的“间接侵略”。第二，必须建立一支“联合国部队”来随时执行美国军队在黎巴嫩所执行的那种任务。第三，由联合国来监听电台广播“谴责煽动内战的宣传”。杜勒斯表示，只有在“联合国”接手以后而认为美国军队不再必要时，美国才会撤退它侵占黎巴嫩的军队。这就表明，美国军队将继续长期占领黎巴嫩，而不是立即撤退。
