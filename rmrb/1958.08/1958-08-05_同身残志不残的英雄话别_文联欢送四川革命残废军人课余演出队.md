Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd. The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a tea party on the 2nd to bid farewell to the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Convalescent Home spare-time performance team, who are about to leave Beijing for a tour of various places. At the meeting, well-known figures from Beijing's literary and art circles joined these staunch comrades, whose willpower remains strong despite their disabilities, to celebrate and say goodbye, expressing their intention to humbly learn from their revolutionary optimism and lofty communist style.

Among those attending the tea party were Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, as well as renowned writers and artists Lao She, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Lü Ji, Bing Xin, Ma Sicong, Jiang Zhaohe, Shao Yu, and famous actors Du Jinfang and Li Shaochun, totaling more than 100 people.

Comrade Wu Yuzhang and Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were also invited to attend the tea party.

Yang Hansheng said in his speech at the beginning of the tea party that the comrades of the spare-time performance team are disabled but their hearts are not. You are good examples for the literary and art circles. He wished the performance team greater success in socialist literary and art propaganda activities.

Lao She, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, and many other artists also spoke. Lao She said that the spare-time performance team's visit to Beijing this time has given us an education on how to be communist writers and artists. He said to the comrades of the performance team, wherever you go, the red flag will be planted. We will definitely follow you. We must pull out the white flags and plant the red flags, so that wherever we go, the red flag will also be planted. Tian Han expressed that he must learn from the performance team's spirit of arduous and extraordinary revolutionary heroism and strive to complete his creative leap forward plan.

Subsequently, Xu Houxian delivered a speech on behalf of all the performers, expressing gratitude for the Party's kind care and the support of the literary and art circles and all other sectors. He said that the Party's care and encouragement are a spur to us. We deeply feel that we have done too little. In the future, we must continue to improve politically, ideologically, and artistically, and repay the Party and all sectors' encouragement and expectations with greater achievements.

Writers and artists had cordial conversations with the members of the performance team at the meeting. Famous actors Du Jinfang, Li Shaochun, Yuan Shihai, Ma Lianliang, Qiu Shengrong, and others sang excerpts from Peking opera.

They have also given reports to more than 70,000 people. The audience unanimously believes that the performances of these Chinese "Paul Korchagins" have given them an unforgettable communist education and gained great encouragement and strength.
