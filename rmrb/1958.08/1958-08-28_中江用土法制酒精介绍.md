　　Introduction to Homemade Alcohol Production in Zhongjiang

    Recently, employees of the Commercial Bureau of Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, have used local methods to replicate alcohol with a purity of 93 degrees from local wine of 50 to 62 degrees. Every hundred catties of local wine can produce twenty-six catties of alcohol, with a maximum yield of twenty-eight catties. The equipment (as shown in the figure) and operation of this local alcohol production method are relatively simple. The method is: (1) First pour the local wine into the steaming pot. Place the first layer of the steaming bottom eight inches away from the wine surface, and place the second layer of the steaming bottom about one foot away from the first layer. Place a layer of about three inches thick of clay tiles and rice husks on the steaming bottom, and then cover it with the camp. (2) At the opening in the center of the camp, install seven overlapping clay jars (the joints must be sealed tightly, and each clay jar has a hole with a diameter of three inches at the bottom). Fill the first, third, and fifth clay jars from the bottom up with small clay tiles, and the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh jars with one-inch-long wheat straw stalks. (3) Install the first wooden box condenser on top of the clay jars, connect it to the second and third condensers with a curved tin pipe, install a lime box under the third condenser to absorb the moisture in the alcohol, and attach a jar for alcohol under the box. (4) After all the installations are completed, start a fire to distill the wine, control the temperature within 80 to 85 degrees, and you can produce alcohol in about 40 minutes. During the operation, special attention should be paid to prevent air leakage at the joints of the clay jars, and the clean water in the condenser should be replaced at any time when it gets hot.

　　中江用土法制酒精介绍
    四川中江县商业局职工最近利用土法以50度—62度的土酒复制成净度达93度的酒精。每百斤土酒可生产二十六斤酒精，最高产二十八斤。这种土法制酒精的设备（如图）和操作都比较简单。方法是：（1）先将土酒倾入甑锅内，在离酒面八寸的地方放第一层甑底，距第一层甑底一尺左右的地方放第二层甑底，甑底上装一层约三市寸厚的瓦块和谷壳，然后盖上营盘。（2）在营盘中央开孔处，重叠安装七个瓦坛（衔接的地方要糊封严密，每个瓦坛底钻一个直径三寸的眼孔），从下往上第一、三、五瓦坛中装满小瓦块，二、四、六、七坛中装满一寸长的麦草秆。（3）在瓦坛顶上安装第一个木箱冷凝器，以弯形锡管与第二、第三冷凝器连接，第三冷凝器下安装石灰箱，以吸收酒精中的水份，箱下安接酒精的坛子。（4）全部安装完毕即生火炼酒，温度控制在80度—85度内，约烧四十分钟便可制出酒精。在操作过程中，要特别注意不使瓦坛衔接处漏气，冷凝器中的清水热了要随时更换。（附图片）
