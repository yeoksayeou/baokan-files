　　Learning from Zhang Qiuxiang
　　Zu Nian
    Where lies the dividing line between advanced and backward, great and insignificant? It lies in how one treats the public and the private. How many people in our society, among the working people, have forgotten themselves for the sake of the public? Zhang Qiuxiang, China's first female researcher, with her selfless spirit in achieving high-yield cotton production, taught the technology to others, allowing them to catch up with her and advance together. This is a typical communist quality, a distinct proletarian thought.
    Some people who hold bourgeois ideas of personal fame and profit become conceited when they become researchers or scientists, treating technology as private property, only to be passed down within the family and not to be shared with outsiders. During the "Double-Anti" movement, there was such a researcher who said: "The technology is in my hands, the knowledge and experience are in my brain, this is a noble property and cannot be 'encroached' upon like land reform and public-private partnerships." This kind of bourgeois thinking has shrunk its market after the nationwide rectification campaign, and people will turn away when they encounter such thinking. Comparing the thoughts and qualities of such people with those of Zhang Qiuxiang, how insignificant, ugly, and dirty they are!
    In production competitions, some people among the working people also have departmentalism. They only see the interests of their own unit and not the interests of the whole; they only care about themselves and not others, fearing that others will catch up with them. These people do not understand the purpose and significance of socialist competition. Socialist competition is not about one or two mu of land, or one or two cooperatives, but about promoting overall production increase for everyone. Zhang Qiuxiang pointed out sharply that those who expect to win by relying on the shortcomings of others are not worthy of participating in socialist competition.
    Another fear of not wanting to help others is the fear of falling behind and not catching up with others. Zhang Qiuxiang said: If you walk fast, I have to run! She also said that if others surpass her, it shows that her own efforts are not enough, and she must move forward faster. Zhang Qiuxiang always looks forward, seeing the favorable conditions; she believes in herself and in the masses: she helps others, and others help her, and everyone advances together. This is the great spirit of the working people, and it is also the purpose of socialist competition.
    Zhang Qiuxiang regards her own achievements and the achievements of others as part of the overall interest, as the result of the leadership of the Party and the help of the masses. Therefore, only for everyone, for the masses, can she make greater progress and make greater contributions to the country. This is where the value of Zhang Qiuxiang's ideology and character lies.
    Zhang Qiuxiang's vivid deeds of helping others catch up with her are worth reading carefully by everyone and used as a model for their own learning, to overcome conservative thinking and departmentalism, and to establish the idea of helping others to advance together. In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, if tens of thousands of people like Zhang Qiuxiang emerge, then our socialist construction will not only advance by leaps and bounds every day, but will leap forward completely by ten thousand miles every day.

　　学习张秋香
　　祖年
    先进与落后、伟大与渺小，分界线在什么地方呢？在于他是如何对待公与私。公而忘私的人，在我们社会里，在劳动人民中，又何止万千呢？我国第一个女研究员张秋香在棉花高额丰产中，以大公无私的精神，把技术教给别人，让别人赶上自己，共同前进。这是典型的共产主义品质、鲜明的无产阶级思想。
    有些抱有资产阶级个人名利思想的人，当他们成为研究员或者科学家的时候，就得意忘形，把技术作为私有财产，只能家传不能外传。在双反运动中，有这样一个研究员，他说：“技术在我手里，知识和经验在我脑子里，这是高尚的财产，不能像土改和公私合营一样受到‘侵犯’。”这种资产阶级思想，在全民整风以后，它的市场缩小了，遇到了这种思想，人们都会掩鼻而过。把这种人的思想、品质和张秋香比起来，那有多么渺小，多么丑恶，多么肮脏！
    在生产竞赛中，劳动人民中，也有一些具有本位主义思想的人，他们只看到本单位的利益，而看不到整体的利益；他们只顾自己、不顾别人，深怕别人赶上自己。这些人不了解社会主义竞赛的目的和意义。社会主义竞赛不是为了一亩两亩田，一个社两个社的问题，而是为了促进大家全面增产。张秋香一针见血地说，指望靠别人的缺点取得胜利的人，就不配参加社会主义竞赛。
    不愿帮助别人还有一怕，就是怕自己落后了，赶不上别人。张秋香却说：你快步走，我就得跑步哩！她又说，如果别人超过了，说明自己努力还不够，更要向前快走。张秋香总是向前看，看到有利的条件；她相信自己，也相信群众：她帮助了别人，别人也帮助她，大家共同前进。这就是劳动人民的伟大气魄，也是社会主义竞赛的目的。
    张秋香，她把自己的成就和别人的成就，都看作是整体利益的一部分，是党的领导和群众帮助的结果，因此只有为了大家，为了群众，才能使自己有更大的提高，才能对国家有更大的贡献。这就是张秋香思想品质可贵的地方。
    张秋香帮助别人赶上自己的生动事迹，值得每一个人认真地读一读，并作为自己学习的榜样，克服保守思想、本位主义思想，树立帮助别人共同前进的思想。在工农业生产大跃进中，如果涌现出成千上万像张秋香式的人物，那末，我们的社会主义建设事业，不是一日千里而将是一日万里地全面跃进。
