　　Britain's Desperate Struggle in Cyprus
　　Shi Lü
    On August 15th, the British government announced its decision to implement a slightly modified version of the "new plan" for resolving the Cyprus issue. As everyone knows, this "new plan," announced by British Prime Minister Macmillan on June 19th, is essentially the old trick of colonialist "divide and rule" that British imperialism is accustomed to playing. This "new plan" stipulates that the international status of the island of Cyprus will remain unchanged for seven years, meaning it will remain a British colony; the 400,000 residents of Greek descent and 100,000 residents of Turkish descent on the island can only be satisfied with establishing separate "Houses of Representatives," and each sending a few people—four Greeks and two Turks—to a committee dominated by the British Governor-General as nominal ministers; the two "Houses of Representatives" only have so-called final legislative power in ethnic affairs, while major powers such as foreign affairs, defense, and internal security remain in the hands of the British Governor-General. This "new plan" is fundamentally incompatible with the Cypriot people's desire for self-determination. Therefore, as soon as the plan was announced, it was met with fierce opposition from the Cypriot people; the governments of Greece and Turkey, which are related to the Cyprus issue, also opposed the plan for different reasons.
    Despite facing strong opposition from all sides, Britain refuses to abandon this plan. On the contrary, it attempts to force the Cypriot people to accept the "new plan." To achieve this goal, Britain encourages Turkish-blooded thugs on the island of Cyprus to attack Greek-blooded residents, causing bloodshed, and then, under the pretext of "maintaining order," massively increases its troops and brutally suppresses the patriotic residents of Cyprus. In the recent period alone, more than 1,700 Greek-blooded residents have been arrested by the British colonial authorities, the island's three concentration camps are already full, and a fourth concentration camp is now being built. At the same time, Britain is also attempting to persuade Greece and Turkey to cooperate with it. Macmillan personally visited Athens and Ankara from August 7th to 10th for this purpose, holding Anglo-Greek and Anglo-Turkish talks that were completely unsuccessful.
    Why is Britain clinging to the "new plan" and refusing to let go?
    Just open a map and look at the location of Cyprus, and then look around at the surging national independence movements in the Middle East, and Britain's eagerness to firmly grasp Cyprus in its hands through the implementation of the "new plan" becomes immediately clear. Since the signing of the agreement between Britain and Egypt in 1954 regarding the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone, Britain has gradually concentrated its troops in Cyprus. In December 1955, the British Middle East Command was moved to Cyprus, and since then, Cyprus has become the most important military base for British imperialism's aggression in the Middle East. The British troops that invaded Egypt in 1956 departed from Cyprus, and the British troops that invaded Jordan this year also departed from there. The victory of the Iraqi revolution has greatly shaken Britain's colonial rule over the oil-rich Persian Gulf sheikhdoms (such as Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Trucial Oman, Oman, etc.). In order to suppress the national liberation movements in the Persian Gulf countries, Britain needs to hold onto the military base of Cyprus even more firmly.
    The whole mystery of the "new plan" lies in stipulating a period of seven years—in Macmillan's own words—of "setting aside extreme solutions." In other words, it requires the Cypriot people not to carry out any movements for self-determination within seven years, not to carry out any resistance to British imperialist rule, and to allow the British colonialists to manipulate them, so that Britain can get the "seven years of rest" that Macmillan emphasizes. In this way, Britain can dispatch troops from Cyprus to invade Middle Eastern countries at any time without any worries, and it also makes it easier for Britain to sabotage and suppress the Cypriot people's national self-determination movement. This is the reason why Britain is eager to announce the implementation of the "new plan."
    However, British imperialism's wishful thinking of obtaining a seven-year respite through the "new plan" is bound to be shattered. Archbishop Makarios, the national leader of Cyprus, on behalf of the Cypriot people, declared on the second day after Britain announced the implementation of the "new plan" that they are "now more determined than ever to defend their right to self-determination and demand their freedom," and that they "will never accept a plan that disregards their basic democratic rights and does not grant them freedom and peace." It can be predicted that the Cypriot people will more extensively launch a resistance movement against British colonial rule in the future, so that Macmillan's longed-for "rest" will not be obtained for even a single day.
    Britain's hasty announcement of the implementation of the "new plan" also has other plans, namely, the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly is about to open, and Greece has proposed to include the Cyprus issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. Britain is attempting to use the excuse that it has already implemented the "new plan" to evade the discussion of the issue, so as to escape the embarrassing situation of being condemned at the United Nations General Assembly. However, Britain's "new plan" is so hypocritical, and Britain's conspiracy to retain Cyprus as a springboard for aggression in the Middle East is so obvious (who would doubt it after Britain's invasion of Jordan?), that it is no longer possible to escape condemnation.
    Although Macmillan has announced the implementation of the "new plan," this "new plan" cannot save British colonial rule. The bloody atrocities of the British army and the concentration camps of the British authorities cannot suppress the Cypriot people's desire for self-determination. In their struggle, the Cypriot people can expect to receive full support from all peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world. (Attached picture)

　　英国在塞浦路斯的绝望挣扎
　　施旅
    英国政府在8月15日宣布，决定把解决塞浦路斯问题的“新计划”略加修改付诸实行。大家知道，这一由英国首相麦克米伦在6月19日宣布的“新计划”，实质上是英帝国主义惯于玩弄的殖民主义
  “分而治之”的老花样。这个“新计划”规定塞浦路斯岛的国际地位在七年内保持不变，也就是说仍旧是英国的殖民地；岛上的四十万希腊血统居民和十万土耳其血统居民只能满足于分别成立单独的“代表院”，并各选派数人——希腊族四名、土耳其族两名——到一个由英国总督独揽大权的委员会去当挂名的部长；两个“代表院”仅仅在民族事务方面有所谓最后的立法权，而外交、防务和内部安全等大权则仍由英国总督掌握。这一“新计划”同塞浦路斯人民要求自决的愿望是根本不相容的。因此，计划一宣布，立即遭到塞浦路斯人民的激烈反对；同塞浦路斯问题有关的希腊和土耳其两国政府也各以不同的理由反对这项计划。
    尽管面临着各方面的强烈反对，英国仍然不肯放弃这一计划。相反的，它企图压服塞浦路斯人民接受“新计划”。为了达到这一目的，英国怂恿塞浦路斯岛上的土耳其血统的暴徒袭击希腊血统居民，造成流血事件，然后借口“维持秩序”，大量增兵，残暴地镇压塞浦路斯的爱国居民。仅仅最近一个时期，就有一千七百多名希腊血统居民被英国殖民当局逮捕，岛上的三个集中营已关满了人，现正在建立第四个集中营。同时，英国也企图说服希腊和土耳其同英国合作，麦克米伦专门为了这个目的而在8月7日到10日亲自访问雅典和安卡拉，进行了结果是完全失败的英希、英土会谈。
    英国为什么死抱住“新计划”不肯放呢？
    只要打开地图看看塞浦路斯所处的位置，再环顾一下中东地区岛风起云涌的民族独立运动，那末，对于英国的急于要通过“新计划”的执行而把塞浦路斯牢牢地掌握在手里的企图，就一目了然了。自从1954年英国和埃及关于苏伊士运河区撤退英军的协定签订后，英国就逐步把军队集中到塞浦路斯，1955年12月，英军中东司令部迁到塞浦路斯，从此塞浦路斯便成为英帝国主义侵略中东的最重要的军事基地。1956年侵略埃及的英国军队是从塞浦路斯出发，今年侵略约旦的英国军队也是从那里出发。伊拉克革命的胜利，使英国对丰产石油的波斯湾各酋长国家（如科威特、巴林、卡塔尔、特鲁西尔阿曼、阿曼等）的殖民统治受到很大震动。为了镇压波斯湾各国的民族解放运动，英国就更要抓牢塞浦路斯这个军事基地了。
    “新计划”的全部奥妙在于规定了一个为期七年的——用麦克米伦自己的话来说——“撇开极端的解决办法的时期”。换句话说，就是要塞浦路斯人民在七年之内不进行任何要求自决的运动，对英帝国主义的统治不进行任何反抗，听任英国殖民者的摆弄，让英国得到麦克米伦所强调的“七年的休息”。这样英国就可以无后顾之忧地随时从塞浦路斯出兵侵略中东各国，同时也便于英国破坏和镇压塞浦路斯人民的民族自决运动。英国急于宣布执行“新计划”，其原因正在此。
    然而，英帝国主义想通过“新计划”得到七年喘息时期的如意算盘，是肯定要被粉碎的。塞浦路斯的民族领袖马卡里奥斯大主教在英国宣布执行“新计划”的第二天，就代表塞浦路斯人民宣布他们“现在比以往任何时候都更加坚决地维护他们的自决权和要求获得他们的自由”，他们“决不会接受一个漠视他们的基本民主权利和不给予他们自由和和平的计划”。可以预料，塞浦路斯人民今后将更加广泛地展开对英国殖民统治的反抗运动，使麦克米伦所渴望的“休息”连一天也得不到。
    英国现在匆忙宣布执行“新计划”，也还有其他的打算，那就是联合国第十三届大会行将开幕，希腊已经提出把塞浦路斯问题列入大会议程，英国企图以已经实行“新计划”为借口来逃避问题的讨论，以解脱在联合国大会上受谴责的尴尬处境。然而，英国的“新计划”是如此的虚伪，英国要保留塞浦路斯作为侵略中东的跳板的阴谋是如此的明显（在英国侵略约旦之后，谁还会怀疑呢？），要想逃避谴责是再也办不到的了。
    尽管麦克米伦已宣布执行“新计划”，但是这个“新计划”挽救不了英国的殖民统治。英国军队的血腥暴行和英国当局的集中营，都压制不住塞浦路斯人民的要求自决权的愿望。塞浦路斯人民在他们的斗争中是可以指望得到全世界一切爱好和平和自由的人民的充分支持的。（附图片）
