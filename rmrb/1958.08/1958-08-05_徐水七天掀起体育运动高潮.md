    XuShui Sets Off a High Tide of Sports in Seven Days
    (Reported by our newspaper) XuShui County, Hebei Province is a national production model county. Due to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, the people of the county are urgently demanding to carry out sports activities. In order to meet the needs of the masses to exercise, the XuShui County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the county to set off a high tide of sports leap forward within seven days, and to universally organize sports teams at the grassroots level; to carry out calisthenics and various sports activities; in addition to middle and primary schools, to first promote the Labor and Defense System in six townships, summarize experiences and promote it throughout the county; and to establish a spare-time sports school for teenagers in each township.
    All townships immediately responded to the call of the county party committee. After seven days and nights of hard work, a high tide of sports activities appeared on the wave of busy production such as wheat harvesting, drought resistance, sowing, and reservoir construction. Sports associations were established in all twenty-four townships and most of the communes in the county, and sports association groups were established in production teams. Calisthenics were widely carried out before and after shifts and in the fields. In four townships, including DaWangDian, more than 460 calisthenics leaders were trained. Under the principle of not spending money or spending less money, the communes built and repaired 62 small sports fields and made many sports equipment themselves. Some young people played basketball in the moonlight, and women organized long-distance and short-distance running teams. Now the county has established three spare-time sports schools for teenagers with more than 120 students.

    徐水七天掀起体育运动高潮
    本报讯　河北省徐水县是全国生产模范县。由于生产大跃进的需要，全县人民迫切要求开展体育活动。中共徐水县委为了满足群众锻炼身体的要求，号召全县在七天之内掀起体育跃进的高潮，在基层中普遍组织运动队；开展广播操和各种体育活动；除中、小学外，在六个乡先推行劳卫制，总结经验在全县推广；每乡建立一所青少年业余体育学校。
    各乡立即响应县委的号召，经过七昼夜的苦战，在麦收、抗旱、播种、修水库等生产紧张的浪头上，出现了体育运动高潮。全县二十四个乡和大部分社建立了体育协会，生产队建立了体协小组。广播操在班前、班后、田间广泛地开展起来。大王店等四个乡，训练领操员四百六十多人。各社在不花钱，少花钱的原则下，新建和修复小型运动场六十二所，自做了许多体育器材。有些青年在月光下打篮球，妇女组织了长跑队、短跑队。现在全县已办青少年业余体育学校三所，学生一百二十多人。
