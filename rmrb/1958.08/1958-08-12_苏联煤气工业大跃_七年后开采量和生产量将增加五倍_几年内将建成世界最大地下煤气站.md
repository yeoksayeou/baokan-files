Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: The Soviet gas industry will develop into an important sector of the Soviet national economy in the shortest period. According to the Seven-Year (1959-1965) National Economic Development Plan currently being formulated, by 1965, the Soviet Union's gas extraction and production will increase almost fivefold to reach 150 billion cubic meters. The heat energy that this gas can generate will be roughly equal to the total heat energy currently produced by the coal produced in the Soviet Union's several major coal regions—Donbas, Pechora, and Moscow coal regions.

	This plan is the first step in realizing the grand production task set for the gas industry in the Soviet Union's long-term plan for national economic development over the next fifteen years, which is to produce 270 billion to 320 billion cubic meters of gas.

	With the rapid increase in gas production, the Soviet Union will build 26,000 kilometers of gas pipelines in the next seven years, which is equal to ten times the total length of gas pipelines built by the Soviet Union during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. A unified gas network will begin to be established in the particularly industrially developed European part of the Soviet Union and the Ural region. In addition, in order to improve the gas supply to cities, it is also planned to build three large-scale gas storage facilities.

	In a few years, tens of thousands of kilometers of newly built gas pipelines will connect more industrial centers, cities, and workers' residential areas in the Soviet Union with gas production areas, transporting gas to industrial enterprises and residents' homes. Gas will be used extensively in the production of industries such as the chemical industry, metallurgical industry, and metal processing industry. Approximately more than 500 cities and residential areas will be gasified in the next seven or eight years. This will greatly promote the rapid development of Soviet industry, especially the chemical industry, and bring many benefits to people's daily lives. For example, the use of gas in industrial production has already made it possible to save the labor of more than 296,000 workers this year; the use of gas in homes will free millions more from tedious housework in the future.
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: The Soviet Union will build the world's largest underground gas station near the city of Stalinsk in Kuzbass, Siberia, in the next few years. The heat energy that the gas it produces annually will be equivalent to the heat energy of one million tons of coal. All the staff at this underground gas station will work above ground, and it will require two-thirds to one-half fewer staff than it would take to mine one million tons of coal in Kuzbass.

	This unparalleled underground gas station will supply gas to the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Integrated Works, one of the Soviet Union's largest iron and steel industrial enterprises. Its unique gas generator will be placed about six meters thick in a coal seam at a depth of 300 meters underground. Vertical, inclined, and parallel channels for burning the coal seam are drilled from the surface of the formation using directional tunneling. In this way, miners do not have to go deep underground when igniting the coal body.

### 苏联煤气工业大跃　七年后开采量和生产量将增加五倍  几年内将建成世界最大地下煤气站

　　苏联煤气工业大跃
　　七年后开采量和生产量将增加五倍
　  几年内将建成世界最大地下煤气站
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联的煤气工业在最短期间将发展成为苏联国民经济中一个重要的工业部门。根据现在正在制订的七年
  （1959—1965年）国民经济发展计划，到1965年，苏联的煤气开采量和生产量将差不多增加为现在的五倍，达到一千五百亿立方公尺。这些煤气所能产生的热能将大约等于苏联几个重要煤区——顿巴斯、彼乔拉和莫斯科煤区目前出产的煤所能产生的全部热能。
    这个计划是实现苏联今后十五年国民经济发展远景计划为煤气工业提出的生产二千七百亿到三千二百亿立方公尺煤气这一宏伟的生产任务的第一步。
    随着煤气产量的迅速增加，最近七年间，苏联将建成两万六千公里长的煤气管，这等于第五个五年计划期间苏联建成的煤气管的总长度的十倍。在工业特别发达的苏联欧洲部分和乌拉尔地区，一个统一煤气网将开始建立起来。此外，为了改善对城市的煤气供应，还计划建设三个大规模的煤气储蓄库。
    几年后，几万公里长的新建煤气管将把苏联更多的工业中心、城市和工人住宅区同煤气产地联结起来，把煤气源源输送到工业企业和居民的住宅中。化学工业、冶金工业和金属加工等工业部门的生产中都将大量采用煤气。大约有五百多个城市和居民点将在最近七、八年煤气化。这将大大促进苏联工业特别是化学工业的迅速发展，并且给人民日常生活中带来许多好处。例如，由于在工业生产中使用煤气，还在今年就使得有可能节省二十九万六千多工人的劳动力；由于在家中使用煤气，今后又将有几百万人从烦琐的家务劳动中解放出来。
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联将在最近几年内在西伯利亚库兹巴斯的斯大林斯克城附近建成一个世界上最大的地下煤气站，它每年所生产的煤气所能产生的热能将相当于一百万吨煤的热能。这个地下煤气站的所有工作人员都将在地上工作，而且它需要的工作人员将比在库兹巴斯开采一百万吨煤所需要的工作人员少二分之一到三分之二。
    这个举世无双的地下煤气站将为苏联最大的钢铁工业企业之一的库兹?茨克钢铁联合工厂供应煤气。它的独特的煤气发生器将安置在三百公尺的地下深处约六公尺厚的煤层中。供燃烧煤层所用的竖的、斜的和平行的孔道是用定向掘进法从地层表面钻掘的。这样，矿工点燃煤体时就不用下到地底深处。
