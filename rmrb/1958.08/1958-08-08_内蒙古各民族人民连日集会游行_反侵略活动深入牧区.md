In the past week, in rural, pastoral, and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas in Zhaowuda League, Jerim League, Hulunbuir League, and Harqin Banner, more than 500,000 people of all nationalities have held rallies and demonstrations continuously. Farmers and herdsmen of all nationalities said at the rallies that we have suffered 14 years of cruel rule and oppression by Japanese imperialism, and the disasters suffered by all nationalities are unforgettable to everyone. Now we have embarked on the socialist road, and our lives are getting better day by day. We will never allow imperialism to come and destroy peace again. We are of one heart with the people of the Middle East and will do our best to support their just struggle. In various cities and towns of the Autonomous Region, propaganda teams of tens of thousands of people have also been formed to carry out anti-aggression propaganda activities.

    内蒙古各民族人民连日集会游行
    反侵略活动深入牧区
    新华社呼和浩特7日电  内蒙古自治区反对美英侵略中东、保卫世界和平的运动正在深入发展。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会呼和浩特市支会发起的保卫和平、反对美英侵略的签名运动，受到内蒙古各族人民的热烈欢迎。到4日为止的四天内，签名人数已达二十五万四千多人。呼和浩特市头道巷小学一位五十岁的老教师从傍晚到午夜，一面宣传，一面征集了一千七百六十人签名。
    自治区各地反对美英侵略中东的运动已逐步深入到乡、社。最近一个星期来，昭乌达盟、哲里木盟、呼伦贝尔盟、喀喇沁旗等地的农村、牧区和半农半牧区，已有五十多万人连续举行集会、示威游行。各族农牧民纷纷在集会上说，我们曾遭受日本帝国主义十四年的残酷统治压迫，各民族灾难深重，这是每个人忘不了的。现在我们走上了社会主义道路，生活一天比一天好，我们绝不允许帝国主义再来破坏和平。我们同中东人民是心连心，尽力支持他们的正义斗争。自治区各地城镇也组成上万人的宣传队伍，展开反侵略宣传活动。
