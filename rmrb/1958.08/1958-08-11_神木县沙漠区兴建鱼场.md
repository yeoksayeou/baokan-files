　　Shenmu County Builds Fish Farm in Desert Area

　　(Our dispatch) Shaanxi Province is building a fish farm in the Hongjian Nur (lake) in the desert area of Shenmu County. It is estimated that five years after the completion of this fish farm, the annual fish production will reach 660,000 to 880,000 jin.

　　After successive investigations by the Central Forestry Survey Team and the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Survey Team, it was believed that the economic value of Hongjian Hai Zi (lake) is very large. The area of the lake is more than 54,000 mu. Carp and crucian carp have been found in the water, and they are growing well. The fish reserves are about 110,000 to 160,000 jin.

　　In order to develop and utilize the lake as soon as possible and put it into production as soon as possible, the farm is currently being built by adopting the method of simultaneous production and construction. On the one hand, they organize small-scale fishing production, and on the other hand, they further understand the situation of the lake, build some necessary houses, fish ponds, and purchase a small amount of boat net tools and other equipment to create conditions for winter ice fishing.

　　神木县沙漠区兴建鱼场
    本报讯　陕西省正在神木县沙漠区的红碱淖兴建养鱼场。预计这个养鱼场建成后五年，每年的鱼产量可达六十六万到八十八万余斤。
    经中央营林调查队和陕西省农业勘察队先后调查后，认为红碱海子的经济价值很大，海的面积有五万四千多亩，水中已发现有鲤鱼和鲫鱼，生长情况很好，鱼的蕴藏量约有十一万到十六万市斤。
    为了尽快的把海子开发和利用起来，早日投入生产，目前该场采用边生产、边筹建的方法进行建场。他们一面组织小规模的捕鱼生产，一面进一步了解海子的情况，修建一些必要房屋、鱼池和购置少量船网工具等设备，给冬季冰下捕鱼创造条件。（附图片）
