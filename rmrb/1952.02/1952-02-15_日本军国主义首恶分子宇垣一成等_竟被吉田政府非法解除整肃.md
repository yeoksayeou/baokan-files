    Japanese militarist chief culprits Ugo Kazushige and others
    illegally released from purge by Yoshida government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Fourteenth] The Japanese reactionary government of Yoshida, in its intensifying rearmament efforts, blatantly issued an order on the 8th, illegally releasing a large number of Japanese militarist chief culprits, including the notoriously criminal Kazushige Ugo, from the purge. The Yoshida government announced the release of a total of one hundred and thirty-eight militarists. The vast majority of them are former Japanese military generals or senior commanders, including three generals: War criminal Kazushige Ugo, who had long served as Minister of the Army (i.e., Minister of War) and Governor-General of Korea; Ban Hasunuma, former Chief of Staff of the Emperor's Military Aides Office; and Shoichi Sugano. Also released from the purge was the war criminal who invaded China, Hachiro Arita. Arita had served as ambassador to China before the war and as "foreign policy advisor" to the Wang Jingwei puppet regime during the war, actively participating in the invasion of China. He served as Foreign Minister of the Hirota Cabinet in 1936, during which time he was involved in the conclusion of the infamous "Anti-Comintern Pact" between Japan and Germany and the "Japan-Italy Agreement".
