    Xinxiang Prefecture Leading Cadres Right-Leaning Paralysis
    Almost Allowed a Major Embezzler to Slip Away
    Editor: The leading comrades of the Xinxiang Prefecture Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company, as well as the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and other units in Pingyuan Province, have a right-leaning paralysis of thought in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, which has resulted in adverse effects. When the movement began, the leading comrades of the Xinxiang Prefecture Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company said to the employees: "Our company doesn't have much embezzlement, no more than 10 million yuan at most." This was exploited by Guan Huiwu, the company's accountant and embezzler. Guan Huiwu pretended to sincerely repent and confessed to embezzling 12.07 million yuan. After hearing Guan's confession, the company's inspection team felt that the amount was detailed, so they believed it without further investigation, and said, "The confession is very good." On February 1st, at the Xinxiang Prefecture conference to expose embezzlers, Guan Huiwu was even regarded as a typical example of an embezzler who confessed voluntarily. The commissioner of the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office announced on the spot that he would be "exempted from punishment" and greatly praised his "spirit of confession." After the meeting, Guan Huiwu secretly said to those who embezzled with him: "They (referring to the leaders of the prefectural committee and the commissioner's office) are still leading the rectification campaign? They can't even investigate such a large amount from me. I only told them a fraction, and they really thought I confessed clearly and thoroughly; and I was also praised. It's a joke!" It was not until recently that the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee received a report from someone else about Guan Huiwu that they realized that Guan Huiwu was a most cunning "big tiger" who had stolen more than 170 million yuan of state property.
    The above facts show that the right-leaning paralysis of thought of the leading comrades of the Xinxiang Prefecture Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company, the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and other units is extremely serious. This kind of right-leaning thought directly hindered the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in this area. I believe that in addition to giving Guan Huiwu, a major embezzler who deliberately deceived and did not confess thoroughly, severe legal sanctions, the responsible cadres of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and the Xinxiang Prefecture Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company should also be ordered to conduct a deep self-criticism of their right-leaning thinking.

    新乡专区领导干部右倾麻痹
    几乎让大贪污犯溜走了
    编辑同志：平原省新乡专区花纱布公司以至新乡专署、新乡地委等单位的领导同志，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，有右倾麻痹思想，结果造成不良影响。当运动开始时，新乡专区花纱布公司领导同志对在职人员说：“咱们公司没有多大贪污数字，最多也超不过一千万元。”他的话被这个公司的会计、贪污分子关惠五钻了空子。关惠五假装诚心悔过，坦白自己贪污一千二百万零七百元。公司的检查小组听了关的坦白后，觉得数目有整有零，于是就信以为真，不加追查，还说：“坦白的很好。”二月一日，新乡专区召开检举贪污分子大会上，关惠五竟被当作贪污分子中自动坦白的典型，由新乡专署的专员当场宣告“予以免罪”，并大大地表扬了他的“坦白精神”。会后，关惠五背地里向和他一起贪污的人说：“他们（指地委和专署领导人）还领导整风？我这么大的数字都整不出来，只向他们说了一个零儿，就真认为我交代的很清楚、很坦白；而且还受到了表扬，这真是笑话！”直到最近，新乡地委接到别人对关惠五的检举材料，才知道关惠五是个最狡猾的盗窃国家资财一亿七千多万元的“大老虎”。
    上面的事实，说明了新乡专区花纱布公司、新乡专署和新乡地委等单位领导同志的右倾麻痹思想是极严重的。这种右倾思想，直接阻碍了这个地区的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。我认为除应给予蓄意蒙骗、不彻底坦白的大贪污分子关惠五以严厉的法律制裁外，并应责成新乡地委和新乡专区花纱布公司的负责干部对自己的右倾思想进行深刻检讨。石玉屏
