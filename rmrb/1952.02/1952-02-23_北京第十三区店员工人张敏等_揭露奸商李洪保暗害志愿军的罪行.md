    Zhang Min and others, workers at a store in Beijing's 13th District, expose the crimes of the unscrupulous merchant Li Hongbao in harming the Volunteer Army
    Li Hongbao, an unscrupulous merchant from the "Juyuan Kui" store in Haidian Town, Beijing's 13th District, has consistently evaded taxes, oppressed workers, and obstructed the organization of trade unions. When making fermented soybeans for the Volunteer Army, he cut corners and harmed the Volunteer Army.
    In 1951, the Native Produce Company entrusted Li Hongbao to process fermented soybeans for the Volunteer Army. When cadres from the Native Produce Company came to inspect at the "Juyuan Kui" store, Li Hongbao invited the cadres to eat at the "Hai Shun Ju" restaurant in Haidian Town and gave the cadres "gifts" such as soy sauce and pickles. As a result, the cadres who inspected the goods were captured by Li Hongbao, and they even gave the inspection stamp to Li Hongbao to use at will. Since then, Li Hongbao has become even more unscrupulous. Fermented soybeans should have been processed with high-quality soy sauce and "August 1st flour," but Li Hongbao used water from soaked soybeans and the worst flour instead; in the summer, Li Hongbao even used flour that had already rotted or was maggot-infested; when the fermented soybeans dried out, Li Hongbao soaked them in water and even added fine salt to the fermented soybeans to increase their weight. It is very easy for Volunteer Army comrades to get sick from eating this kind of fermented soybeans.
    We believe that the unscrupulous merchant Li Hongbao intentionally harmed the Volunteer Army. In the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, Li Hongbao's attitude was very arrogant, resisting confession. We hope that the relevant departments will promptly investigate, and we request that the People's Government severely punish Li Hongbao.

    北京第十三区店员工人张敏等
    揭露奸商李洪保暗害志愿军的罪行
    北京市第十三区海甸镇“聚源魁”号奸商李洪保，一贯偷漏税款、欺压工人、阻扰组织工会。他在给志愿军作豆豉时，偷工减料，暗害志愿军。
    一九五一年，土产公司委托李洪保为志愿军加工豆豉。当土产公司干部到“聚源魁”号检查时，李洪保便请干部在海甸镇的“海顺居”饭店吃饭，并且送酱油、酱菜等“礼物”给干部。结果，验货的干部被李洪保俘掳了，他们甚至把验货的戳子交给李洪保随便使用。从此以后，李洪保更是肆无忌惮地为非作恶。豆豉本来应该用高酱油和“八一粉”加工，李洪保却用泡黄豆的水和最坏的面粉顶替；在夏天，李洪保甚至使用已经发臭的或者已经生蛆的面粉；豆豉干了，李洪保便用水泡，甚至加细盐在豆豉内，使豆豉涨分量。志愿军同志们吃了这种豆豉是很容易生病的。
    我们认为奸商李洪保是有意暗害志愿军。在反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中，李洪保的态度很蛮横，抗拒坦白。我们希望有关部门迅速检查，并请人民政府严办李洪保。
