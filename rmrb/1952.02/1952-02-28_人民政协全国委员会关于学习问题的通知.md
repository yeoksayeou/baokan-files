    (1) This committee issued a notice on January 5, calling on people from all walks of life across the country to take the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy as the current learning content, to cooperate with actual struggles, and stipulating that this learning be used as the rectification study for people from all walks of life participating in the study this year. The original duration of this study was set for two months, but if it is felt to be insufficient, local consultative bodies may extend it as appropriate. In addition to reading documents, organizing reports and discussions, this study should unfold self-criticism and mutual criticism, striving to deeply connect with reality in order to achieve the desired effect.

    (2) The movement of the industrial and commercial sectors, closely coordinated with the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, has been launched and is deepening in some areas. This is a resolute counterattack by the working class and the people's democratic united front against the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie over the past three years, and it is a social movement of extremely great significance. Local consultative bodies should consider the situation and mobilize a group of people participating in the study of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy to participate in the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence.

    (3) The Learning Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, established in accordance with this committee's January 5th "Decision on Launching the Ideological Remolding Learning Movement for People from All Walks of Life," was established on February 19th to lead the learning of people from all democratic parties, non-party individuals in governments and people's organizations at all levels and consultative bodies, experts in government and enterprise organs, people from the industrial and commercial sectors, and people from religious circles. It is now stipulated that if local consultation committees have not yet established learning committees, they must be formally established within one month of receiving this document, and a report on the situation must be submitted. Local learning committees (or the consultative bodies acting on their behalf before establishment) must submit a written summary of the past learning situation of people from all walks of life to this committee's learning committee before the end of March, in order to study and formulate future learning plans.
