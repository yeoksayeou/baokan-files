    The Allegation of "Gifts" to He Cheng in the Luo Huichun Embezzlement Case is Inconsistent with the Facts

    Editor: In the article "Northeast Pharmaceutical Company Manager Luo Huichun Falls into the Quagmire of the Bourgeoisie" by Comrade Tian Liu on page two of the People's Daily on January 25th, it was stated: "He even sent 'gifts' directly to He Cheng, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Health." Regarding this issue, after conducting investigations from various sources, I have clarified the truth of the matter as follows:

    Luo Huichun confessed to having sent a car to the Ministry of Health. However, in reality, this was merely a deception employed by Luo Huichun to steal state property. The facts are as follows:

    In the spring of 1950, the General Logistics Department's Health Bureau, through Liu Xihai (the driver), exchanged an old sleeper car (which was frequently out of service, causing delays) and a three-wheeled motorcycle with Luo Huichun in Tianjin for another old sleeper car. According to Liu Xihai's recent explanation: the exchanged old sleeper car was valued at 100 million yuan at the time, while Luo Huichun took away the two vehicles from the General Logistics Department's Health Bureau which were worth at least 60 million yuan at the time. Luo Huichun instructed Liu Xihai not to inform me of the car exchange, while on the other hand, he claimed to the Northeast Military Region's Health Department that he was "gifting" the car to me, and obtained 1 billion Northeast yuan (equivalent to 90 million RMB based on the exchange rate at the time) as "institutional household expenses." That is to say, a transaction that only required a supplement of 40 million yuan was exploited by Luo Huichun to embezzle 50 million yuan of public funds. If his confession implies he sent another car to the Ministry of Health, then he would have embezzled a total of 150 million RMB. One of these two scenarios must be true, and further investigation is required. I did not notice this at the time, and this is my responsibility for negligence in oversight.

    In addition to this, Luo Huichun also claimed to have sent another car to the General Logistics Department's Health Bureau. This refers to a small car sent by the Northeast People's Government's Health Department in September 1949 for use at the National Health Administration Conference. This car was later retained for public use by the General Logistics Department's Health Bureau, which did not comply with financial regulations, and it has now been decided to return it.

    As for Luo Huichun's claim that he sent me some clothing material, deer antler essence, and over 20 million Northeast yuan, with the exception that Luo Huichun did indeed send my wife, Comrade Zhou Yuehua, a few bottles of deer antler essence, the rest is completely untrue.

    Based on the above facts, the news in the People's Daily on January 25th stating that Luo Huichun sent gifts directly to He Cheng is inconsistent with the facts. I hope that my explanation will be published in the newspaper.

### 罗惠春贪污案中所谓给贺诚“送礼”一节与事实不符

    罗惠春贪污案中所谓给贺诚“送礼”一节与事实不符
    编辑同志：一月二十五日人民日报第二版田流同志作“东北医药公司经理罗惠春堕入资产阶级泥坑”一文内说：“他还把‘礼物’一直送到中央卫生部副部长贺诚处。”对于这个问题经我向各方面作了调查，查明这事的真相如下：
    罗惠春供称曾送汽车给卫生部。但事实上这只是罗惠春盗窃国家财产的一个骗局。事实是这样的：
    一九五○年春军委卫生部曾由刘喜海（司机）向罗惠春以旧卧车一部（这部卧车常停驶，以致误事）和三轮摩托车一部，由天津换到另一部旧卧车。据刘喜海最近说明：换到的那部旧卧车当时曾作价一亿元，而罗惠春当时由军委卫生部拿走那两部汽车当时至少价值六千万元。罗惠春当时叫刘喜海不要把换车的经过告诉我，另一方面他却向东北军区卫生部以给我“送”汽车为名领了“机关家务”东北币十亿元（按当时币值折合为人民币九千万元）。这就是说，本来只须补足四千万元的交易，却被罗惠春利用来盗骗了公家资财五千万元。如果他的供词为另送卫生部一辆汽车，他就总共贪污了人民币一亿五千万元。两者必居其一，尚待查清。我当时没有发觉，这是我疏于检查的责任。
    除此以外，罗惠春还说送过又一辆汽车给军委卫生部。这是指一九四九年九月由东北人民政府卫生部送给全国卫生行政会议用的一辆小车。这辆小车后留军委卫生部公用，不合财政制度，现在决定退回。
    至于罗惠春所说曾送给我一些衣料、鹿茸精和两千多万东北币一节，除罗惠春确曾送给我的妻子周越华同志几瓶鹿茸精外，完全不是事实。
    根据上述事实，一月二十五日人民日报的新闻所说罗惠春把礼物一直送到贺诚处，是与事实不符的。希望把我的这个说明在报上公布。
