Exploiting Authority, Accepting Bribes, Betraying the Interests of the Working Class
Tianjin Labor Bureau’s Corrupt Element Zhao Qingyun Arrested

Zhao Qingyun, Deputy Section Chief of the Mediation Section of the Tianjin Labor Bureau, exploited his authority, accepted bribes from capitalists, betrayed the interests of the working class, colluded with private merchants using his embezzled gains, invested in shares, and engaged in illegal trading; he even shielded counter-revolutionaries and undermined state power. Zhao Qingyun has become a spy of the bourgeoisie within state organs and a traitor to the working class. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he refused to confess and has been arrested and brought to justice.

In April 1950, the capitalist of Tianjin Yongkang Silk and Satin Shop, in order to conceal their crimes of illegal operation and tax evasion, distributed 24 taels of gold and 300 bolts of cloth to their employees. Later, the capitalist felt remorse and attempted to deny it. They went to the Mediation Section of the Labor Bureau to fabricate facts, falsely claiming that they were forced to distribute the funds under the threat of workers because they did not understand the policies. They asked Zhao Qingyun: Did the workers violate the policies? Zhao Qingyun immediately replied to the capitalist: It is certainly a violation of policy for workers to distribute the funds. With Zhao Qingyun's support, the capitalist returned to the shop and threatened the workers, saying, "Distributing the funds is a violation of policy." He demanded that the workers immediately return the cloth. When the workers disagreed, the capitalist requested mediation by the Labor Bureau. During the dispute mediation, Zhao Qingyun completely sided with the capitalist, emphasizing the workers' error in distributing the funds and forcing the workers to return the cloth to the capitalist; he did not pursue the capitalist's crimes. After the dispute ended, the capitalist was immensely grateful and bribed Zhao with 2 million RMB. In October of the same year, a labor-capital dispute occurred at the British-owned Heji Egg Factory. The Tianjin Labor Bureau sent Zhao Qingyun to mediate. In the process, Zhao Qingyun acted entirely according to the opinions of the British manager, saying:
	"The workers' demands are too high and do not conform to current policies." He also asked the Party members and Youth League members in the factory to persuade the workers to lower their demands. When convening a meeting of all factory workers, Zhao Qingyun emphasized the difficulties of the capitalist at the meeting and criticized the workers for making excessive demands. But because he was afraid, he feared that the workers would disagree with the capitalist's demands at the meeting. He accused the workers of having bad elements trying to sabotage and notified the Public Security Bureau to send armed personnel to monitor, scaring the workers into silence. Under Zhao Qingyun's threats, the workers gave up their reasonable demands. The British merchant's desires were fully satisfied. Afterwards, the British merchant Marshall said, "There is only one good person in China, and that is Mr. Zhao." He then sent Zhao blankets, sweaters, and other items as rewards.

The capitalist of Zhongyihou Merchant Shop in the Ninth District of Tianjin passively managed and privately dismissed all workers. However, because the closure had not been approved by the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the business license could not be cancelled, and taxes still had to be paid as usual. The manager of this shop, through Zhao Qingyun's mistress, asked Zhao to write a letter of certification, which allowed them to cancel the business license.

After Zhao Qingyun betrayed the interests of the working class and accepted bribes from capitalists, he used the embezzled money as capital, colluded with private merchants to engage in speculation, and used his authority to extort and plunder. In 1950, he privately sold silver dollars, disrupting the financial market; and relying on his identity as a government cadre, he ate "hero shares" (identity shares) in Fuxing Freight Yard, successively obtaining more than 59 million RMB in "dividends," and was eventually promoted to manager. In 1950, Zhao also privately set up a fish drying yard near the Jingang Bridge in Tianjin, making a huge profit of over 40 million RMB in a month. Feeling that the news was too loud and afraid of being discovered by the leadership, he invested the capital in Anxin Town's Liuhegong Fish Shop and Qingfeng Cotton Shop. Zhao has become an illegal merchant, wearing the cloak of a government worker, directly protecting the interests of the bourgeoisie.

Zhao Qingyun not only openly used his authority to protect the interests of the bourgeoisie, but also openly used his authority to shield and protect counter-revolutionaries. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, the government arrested a counter-revolutionary from the Jinjiayao Wax Shop. The family members of this counter-revolutionary, through the manager of Yucheng Barber Shop, bribed Zhao Qingyun with 200 silver dollars, 2 million RMB, sweaters, fur coats, and other items. Zhao used his authority to help the family members of the counter-revolutionary and the counter-revolutionary meet and secretly communicate information. When Tianjin vigorously suppressed the Yiguandao, Zhao accepted a bribe of 5 million RMB from the Yiguandao leader, the manager of the Tiantai Printing House, and used his authority to "prove" that this person "was not Yiguandao."

After Zhao betrayed the working class, he attempted to turn the Mediation Section of the Labor Bureau into his own tool. He shamelessly bribed the cadres of the Mediation Section, often giving them pens, watches, fish, shrimp, and other items, and inviting them to his home for dinner, to corrupt the cadres, attempting to completely transform the Mediation Section of the Labor Bureau into an organ protecting the interests of the bourgeoisie.

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Zhao Qingyun resisted in every way. At first, he falsely claimed to be in poor health, requesting a doctor to issue a "certificate" to take sick leave to avoid the brunt of the movement. Then, he spread smoke screens, saying: "There is no corruption in the Labor Bureau, only bureaucracy and waste are more serious." Attempting to shift the goal of the movement. After these attempts failed, he suppressed democracy and threatened the masses. He said: "Accusations must be based on solid evidence, and problems must be thoroughly understood before they are discussed, otherwise it will be unfavorable to whoever talks!" At the same time, he entered into a "defense alliance" with unscrupulous merchants. Despite repeated talks with him by leading comrades, he remained determined to betray the working class to the end and refused to confess. Therefore, at the request of all cadres of the Tianjin Labor Bureau and the working masses of Tianjin, he was handed over to the Tianjin People's Court for punishment.

    利用职权，接受贿赂，出卖工人阶级利益
    天津市劳动局贪污分子赵庆云被逮捕
    天津市劳动局调处科副科长赵庆云，利用职权，接受资本家贿赂，出卖工人阶级利益；并把贪污所得勾结私商、投资入股，进行非法买卖；更包庇反革命分子，破坏国家政权。赵庆云已经成为资产阶级在国家机关中的奸细和工人阶级的叛徒；在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他又拒不坦白，已被逮捕法办。
    一九五○年四月，天津永康绸缎庄资方为了掩饰其非法经营、偷税漏税的罪行，曾以二十四两黄金及三百匹布分给职工。后来，资方感到懊悔，企图抵赖，即到劳动局调处科捏造事实，诡称由于自己不了解政策，在工人威胁之下被迫分掉资金；并询问赵庆云：工人是否违反政策？赵庆云立即回答资方说：工人分掉资金，当然是违反政策的。资方得到赵庆云的支持，回到店中即威胁工人说：“分掉资金是违反政策的行为。”要工人立即把布匹退回。工人不同意，资方就请求劳动局调解。赵庆云在调解纠纷时，完全站在资方立场，强调工人分掉资金的错误，强迫工人把布匹退还资方；对于资方的罪行，则不加追究。纠纷结束后，资方感恩不尽，即贿赂赵犯人民币二百万元。同年十月，英商合记蛋厂发生劳资纠纷，天津市劳动局派赵庆云去调解。赵庆云在处理过程中，完全按照英商经理的意见办事，说：
    “工人要求太高，不合乎目前的政策。”他并要求厂里的党员、团员说服工人降低要求。在召集全厂工人开会时，赵庆云在大会上强调资方困难，批评工人要求过高。但他做贼胆虚，怕工人在大会上不同意资方要求，竟诬蔑工人中有坏分子企图捣乱，并通知公安局派出所派武装人员来监视，吓得工人面面相觑，不敢发言。工人就在赵庆云的威胁下，放弃了合理要求。英商的欲望得以完全满足。事后，英商马歇尔说：“中国只有一个好人，就是赵先生。”随即送给赵犯毯子、毛衣等物，作为报酬。
    天津市第九区忠义厚商号资方消极经营，私自解雇全部工人。但因未经工商局批准停业，无法注销营业证，仍须照常纳税。这个商号的经理就通过赵庆云的姘妇，让赵给写了证明信，而得注销了营业证。
    赵庆云出卖工人阶级利益，接受资本家贿赂以后，就把贪污赃款作为资金，勾结私商，进行投机买卖，并利用职权敲诈掠夺。一九五○年，他私自贩卖银元，扰乱金融市场；又仗恃政府干部身份，在复兴货栈吃“好汉股”（身份股），先后获得“红利”五千九百余万元，最后并被推为经理。一九五○年，赵犯又在天津金钢桥附近私设晒鱼场，一个月就获暴利四千余万元。他感到风声太大，怕被领导方面发觉，就把资本投入安新镇六合公鱼店和庆丰棉花店。赵犯已变成了一个不法商人，披着政府工作人员的外衣，直接保护资产阶级利益。
    赵庆云不仅公开地利用职权保护资产阶级利益，并且公开地利用职权包庇、袒护反革命分子。一九五一年镇压反革命时期，政府逮捕了金家窑腊店的
    一个反革命分子。这个反革命分子的家属就托裕成理发店的经理，以银元二百个、人民币二百万元及毛衣、皮袄等物贿赂赵庆云。赵犯就利用职权帮助反革命分子家属和反革命分子见面，私通消息。天津市大张旗鼓地镇压一贯道时，赵犯又接受一贯道坛主、天泰印字馆经理五百万元的贿赂，利用职权，“证明”这个人“不是一贯道”。
    赵犯叛变工人阶级以后，便企图把劳动局调处科变为自己的御用工具。他无耻地对调处科的干部进行贿赂收买，时常送给他们钢笔、手表、鱼虾及其他物品，并请他们到他家里吃饭，以腐蚀干部，企图把劳动局调处科彻底地变成保护资产阶级利益的机关。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，赵庆云百般抗拒。他起初诡称身体不好，要求医生开具“证明”，请假休养，以躲避运动的锋芒。接着，他又散布烟幕说：“劳动局没有什么贪污，只是官僚主义和浪费现象比较严重。”企图转移运动目标。这些企图都失败后，他就压制民主，威胁群众。他说：“检举必须证据确凿，对问题必须彻底了解以后再谈，否则谁谈了就对谁不利！”同时，他又和奸商订立“攻守同盟”。虽经领导同志多次找他谈话，但他仍决心背叛工人阶级到底，拒不坦白。因此，天津市劳动局在全体干部和天津市工人群众的要求下，把他送交天津市人民法院惩办。
