Cultural Briefs

    ▲ The Cultural Education Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government and the Yunnan Provincial Land Reform Work Committee decided to utilize the winter vacation to organize over 2,400 faculty and staff from universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Kunming, as well as students from Yunnan University and Kunming Normal College, to go to the countryside to participate in land reform work, laying the foundation for ideological reform in the cultural and educational circles in 1952. Teachers and students from various schools approved to participate in land reform have departed for eighteen counties since February 11th to participate in land reform.
    Furthermore, 1,276 teachers and students from the Science, Engineering, and Agriculture departments of Guangxi University have formed four large teams and departed successively to Lingui, Yongfu, Xing'an, and Lingchuan counties since February 1st to participate in land reform review work.
    ▲ In order to conduct in-depth propaganda for the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the "Serial Pictures News" No. 18, compiled by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, was published on February 16th as a special issue reflecting this movement. The main contents of this issue include serial pictures such as "Communist Party Member Zhang Ziliang Who Consistently Maintains a Hardworking and Simple Style," "Youth League Member Chen Tingsong Who Resolutely Fights Against Bureaucracy," "Putting Down the Burden and Starting Anew," and "Corrupt Elements Confess Immediately."
