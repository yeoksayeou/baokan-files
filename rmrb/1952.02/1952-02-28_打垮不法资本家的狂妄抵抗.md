Smash the Arrogant Resistance of Illegal Capitalists
    Jiang Heng
    In the massive movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence, some capitalists have already recognized and confessed their criminal acts, and some have begun to awaken and are willing to confess and repent. They expressed their willingness to honestly transform themselves under the leadership of the working class. This is good. However, there are still some capitalists who not only refuse to confess their crimes, but also resist this movement to this day. They openly defy the various orders issued by local governments in the movement, and use various despicable and shameless means to counterattack the people's government and workers and shop assistants.
    At the beginning of the movement, these illegal capitalists refused to admit that the corruption of staff members was mainly the result of the erosion of bourgeois ideology. But after everyone revealed the facts of their bribery and other means of corrupting cadres, they adopted an evasive or sophistical attitude. For example, among the six chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee (except for one representing public enterprises) and the twenty-nine standing committee members, only a few confessed well, and most of them avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial, vainly attempting to muddle through this "checkpoint." For example, Zi Yaohua, the general manager of Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank and a member of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, pretended to be active, shouting "support" and expressing "great excitement," but hurriedly burned the back accounts in the vault and warehouse to resist the movement. Zhang Shijun, director of the Peng County Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee in Western Sichuan, in order to cover up his crime of corrupting cadres and evading about 500 million yuan in business tax, illegally organized a "‘Five-Anti’ Study Guidance Committee," gathered more than 40 illegal capitalists, and launched a "struggle" against small industrial and commercial households in an attempt to shift the target of struggle. The capitalists of Shanghai Minfeng, Huafeng and other paper companies slandered the government's auditing as "finding fault" and openly resisted the government's inspection. Some members of the preparatory committees of industry associations in Chengdu openly refused government cadres to participate in their "confession and exposure" meetings under the pretext of "internal meetings." There are also many people who counterattack the people's government by spreading rumors, distorting policies, destroying evidence, suspending business, selling houses, absconding to "avoid the wind," acting crazy and foolish, or pretending to "commit suicide." Xu Wende, the person in charge of Tongfeng Mercerizing and Dyeing Factory in Changshu District, Shanghai, and deputy director of the yarn dyeing group of the Machine Dyeing Industry Association, feigned a suicide note, letting others spread rumors everywhere, saying that "the Tax Bureau forced Xu Wende to death." But before long, this Xu Wende, who had already declared "suicide," fell into the people's net again. Based on the above facts alone, it has already shown how rampant the illegal activities of illegal capitalists resisting the people's government are.
    In order to smash the conspiracies of illegal capitalists, the people's governments in various places have respectively promulgated decisions on punishing illegal capitalists for sabotaging and resisting the movement, and sent a large number of cadres deep into the masses to lead the masses to resolutely counterattack the counterattacks of illegal capitalists. For example, the Peng County People's Government in Western Sichuan, in response to the illegal activities of Zhang Shijun, director of the county's Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, who gathered crowds to "struggle" against small merchants and falsely accused district cadres of "sheltering" and "accepting bribes," sent cadres to widely publicize policies among the masses, expressing a firm attitude of supporting the masses, and then convened a people's representative meeting of all circles in Chengguan to launch a face-to-face struggle against Zhang Shijun and others, smashing his conspiracy and disbanding the illegal organization of the profiteers. Such victorious struggles like smashing Zhang Shijun are everywhere.
    While counterattacking the people's government, illegal capitalists also use various conspiracies and tricks to coerce bribed staff members into forming "alliances of offense and defense," preventing them from confessing, or only allowing them to confess small problems, but not allowing them to confess big problems, and even instigating them to abscond. If the bribed staff members refuse to form an "alliance of offense and defense," these illegal capitalists will threaten them with "jail" and "no way out for the whole family." But this so-called "alliance of offense and defense," as Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out, is the most stupid and reactionary "alliance of offense and defense." What they "defend" is personal illegal interests and acts of embezzlement and theft, and what they "attack" is our entire country and people. Therefore, it is not the general staff members who confess bribery and their families who have "no way out," but the big thieves and big embezzlers who do not confess themselves and prevent others from confessing. This so-called "alliance of offense and defense" is not only reactionary and illegal, but also not a "mysterious organization" that will never be broken. Now many "alliances of offense and defense" in various places have collapsed due to the confession of bribed staff members or the exposure of the masses. Liu Guifu, the director of Xinbeihua Iron Factory in Tianjin, once coerced bribed cadres not to speak even if "a knife is placed on their necks," but as a result, the bribed cadres still spoke. Obviously, the trick of illegal capitalists attempting to resist the confession and exposure movement with an "alliance of offense and defense" is also unworkable and leads to self-destruction. Therefore, all those who have formed an "alliance of offense and defense" must recognize the reactionary nature of the so-called "alliance of offense and defense" and consciously choose the path they should take.
    While illegal capitalists coerce bribed staff members into forming "alliances of offense and defense," they also use various despicable and barbaric means to counterattack shop assistants and workers. Workers and shop assistants are most aware of the capitalists' bribery and theft, so the counterattacks of illegal capitalists against workers and shop assistants are even more fierce and rampant. Their counterattack methods are generally to soften first and then threaten, and if the threat fails, they will dismiss, beat, and even kill them. These illegal capitalists' atrocities of persecuting workers and shop assistants are outrageous. In terms of softening, some use bribery, salary increases, bonuses, and invitations to become managers, while others sow discord, or forcibly pull on the relationship between villagers and friends, and even use beauty traps to lure workers and shop assistants to refuse to expose them. Liu Xiyou, the capitalist of Tianjin Tongsheng Hao Paint Shop, attempted to bribe the shop assistant Cheng Lianrong with 100 million yuan, and the manager of Beijing Jinlong Automobile Factory attempted to hire the trade union organizer Su Shaoqing as the factory director, and so on. In terms of threats, they used methods such as reducing meals, canceling welfare, stopping wages, dismissing, and closing down, and even threatened workers and shop assistants with words such as "I will make your family ruined." Once the temptation and threat failed, some capitalists with human faces and animal hearts became even more fierce, driving away the workers and shop assistants who exposed them, or even beating and killing them. Chen Yinshun, the capitalist of Fujian Xiefengde Aquatic Products Import and Export Firm, after failing to threaten worker activist Zheng Tianlai by means of dismissal, instead accused Zheng Tianlai of theft, and instigated shop assistants who were related to him to hold a meeting to "struggle" until Zheng Tianlai was forced to death. This atrocity of illegal capitalists persecuting shop assistants and workers has also occurred continuously in other regions. According to a very incomplete statistic in the past one month or so, more than 20 cases have occurred in Tianjin, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Wuxi, Nanjing, Jilin and other places. Among these workers and shop assistants (some of whom are workers' family members), some were forced to commit suicide, and some were beaten to death by capitalists with iron hammers, chopped to death with kitchen knives, or strangled to death with ropes. These shameless atrocities of illegal capitalists are enough to prove how frantic the bourgeoisie's attack has reached, and such frantic illegal capitalists must be severely punished.
    No matter how arrogant the illegal capitalists' sabotage and resistance to the confession and exposure movement is, it can be asserted that the many conspiracies and tricks they play will certainly and have already suffered a shameful defeat. The Hangzhou Fuhua No. 1 Silk Factory workers' united defeat of the capitalist's conspiracy to resist the movement by means of "stoppage of work," and the model action of the shop assistant Cheng Lianrong who refused to accept a bribe of 100 million yuan, are powerful counterattacks against the arrogant resistance of illegal capitalists. The experience of mobilizing workers and shop assistants in Tianjin proves that as long as workers and shop assistants are fully mobilized and organized, even the most cunning illegal capitalists will have to bow their heads and admit their guilt.
    In order to thoroughly defeat the arrogant resistance of illegal capitalists, first of all, in areas where the workers and shop assistants of private enterprises have not been universally mobilized, efforts should be made to mobilize workers and shop assistants immediately; in areas where workers and shop assistants have already been mobilized, the weakest links in the work of shop assistants should be seized immediately, such as those shop assistants, especially senior staff, who have relatives and friends with the capitalists, and all of them should be mobilized to join the battle. Since workers and shop assistants are the people who know the "bottom line" of the capitalists best, mobilizing them is an important link in continuing to consolidate and strengthen the fighting ranks, completely isolate and defeat the illegal capitalists. Secondly, all illegal capitalists who dare to sabotage and resist the confession and exposure movement must be required to be sanctioned by the people's government according to law and discipline; and if the trade associations affiliated to the Federation of Industry and Commerce dare to obstruct the development of the movement, they should be reorganized. At the same time, propaganda work should be continued to be strengthened among the people of all strata, exposing the crimes of the profiteers, so that the counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant attack can truly form a broad mass movement, so as to achieve a complete victory in the movement.

　　打垮不法资本家的狂妄抵抗
    江横
    在声势浩大的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报运动中，有一些资本家已经认识和坦白了自己的罪恶行为，有的则已开始觉悟，愿意坦白悔过。他们表示愿意老老实实地在工人阶级的领导下，进一步改造自己。这是好的。但还有一部分资本家，不仅不愿意坦白自己的犯罪行为，而且直到现在对这一运动还抱着抵抗的态度。他们公然违抗各地政府在运动中所颁布的各项命令，施用各种卑鄙无耻的手段，向人民政府和工人店员进行反扑。
    这些不法资本家在运动开始时，不肯承认工作人员的贪污腐化主要是资产阶级思想侵蚀的结果。但当大家揭发了他们用行贿以及其他手段腐蚀干部的事实后，他们又采取了躲躲闪闪或强词争辩的态度。例如武汉市工商业联合会筹委会六个正副主委（代表公营企业的一人除外）、二十九个常务委员中只有少数人坦白较好，大多数人是避重就轻，说小的不说大的，妄图混过这一“关”去。例如上海商业储蓄银行总经理、天津市人民政府委员资耀华，一面假装积极，高喊“拥护”，表示“很是兴奋”，一面却匆忙地把保险库和仓库的后账烧毁，抵抗运动。川西彭县工商联合会筹备委员会主任张仕俊，为掩饰自己腐蚀干部和偷漏营业税约五亿元的罪行，竟非法组织“‘五反’学习辅导委员会”，纠集不法资本家四十多人，向小的工商业户展开“斗争”，企图转移斗争目标。上海民丰、华丰等造纸公司资方，诬蔑政府查账为“找岔子”，公然对抗政府的检查。成都市部分行业公会筹备委员会委员，借口“内部会议”，公开拒绝政府干部参加他们的“坦白检举”大会。还有不少人则以散布谣言、曲解政策、消灭罪证、暂停营业、出卖房子、潜逃“避风”、装疯装傻或伪装“自杀”等卑劣手法，向人民政府反扑。上海市常熟区同丰丝光染厂负责人、机器染织业公会染纱组副主任委员徐文德，假意留书“自杀”，让别人四出散布谣言，说“税务局逼死徐文德”。但为时不久，这个已经宣称“自杀”的徐文德，又落入人民的法网。仅仅根据以上的事实，就已经说明不法资本家顽抗人民政府的非法活动是如何的猖狂了。
    为了粉碎不法资本家的阴谋活动，各地人民政府分别颁布了关于制裁不法资本家破坏和抵抗运动的决定，并派大批干部深入群众，领导群众给不法资本家的反扑以坚决回击。例如川西彭县人民政府，即针对该县工商业联合会筹备委员会主任张仕俊聚众“斗争”小商户和诬告区干部“包庇”、“受贿”的非法活动，派出干部，在群众中广泛地宣传了政策，表明了坚决给群众撑腰的态度，接着召开了城关各界人民代表会议，对张仕俊等展开面对面的斗争，粉碎了他的阴谋，解散了奸商的非法组织。象打垮张仕俊的这样的胜利斗争，到处都是有的。
    不法资本家在向人民政府反扑的同时，还施用各种阴谋诡计，胁迫受贿赂的工作人员订立“攻守同盟”，阻止他们坦白，或只许他们交代小问题，而不准他们交代大问题，甚至鼓动他们潜逃。如果受贿赂的工作人员拒绝订立“攻守同盟”，这些不法资本家就以“坐牢”“全家大小没有活路”来威吓他们。但是这种所谓“攻守同盟”，正如薄一波同志所指出的：是最愚蠢的最反动的“攻守同盟”。他们所“守”的是个人的不法利益和贪污盗窃行为，所“攻”的是我们整个国家和人民。因而没有“活路”的并不是一般坦白受贿行为的工作人员及其家人，而是自己不坦白并阻止别人坦白的大盗窃犯大贪污犯。这种所谓“攻守同盟”不仅是反动的，违法的，而且也不是永远不会被攻破的“神秘组织”。现在各地有不少“攻守同盟”，由于受贿赂的工作人员的坦白或群众的检举已纷纷瓦解了。天津市新北华铁工厂厂长刘桂馥，曾经胁迫受贿的干部即使“刀放在脖子上也不要说”，但结果受贿赂的干部还是说了。很显然的，不法资本家妄图以“攻守同盟”来抵抗坦白检举运动的诡计，同样是行不通的，而且是自寻绝路。因此，凡订有“攻守同盟”的人，必须认识所谓“攻守同盟”的反动性，清醒地选择自己所应该走的道路。
    不法资本家一面胁迫受贿赂的工作人员订立“攻守同盟”，一面则采用各种卑鄙的、野蛮的手段向店员工人进行反扑。资本家的行贿和盗窃行为，工人店员最为摸底，因而不法资本家对工人店员的反扑更为凶恶猖狂。他们反扑的方法，一般是先软化而后威胁，威胁不成即加以解雇、殴打，甚至加以杀害。这些不法资本家迫害工人店员的暴行，令人发指。在软化方面，他们有的是利用了贿赂、加薪加级、分红入股和聘请当经理等等的手段，有的是挑拨离间，或硬拉乡亲朋友关系，甚至施用美人计，引诱工人店员拒不检举。天津同胜号颜料庄资方刘锡祐企图拿一亿元来贿赂店员程连荣，北京市津隆汽车厂经理企图聘请工会组织员苏少清当厂长等等。在威胁方面，他们利用了降低伙食、取消福利、停发工资、解雇、关门歇业等等手段，甚至以“叫你家破人亡”的话来威胁工人店员。一旦利诱威胁失败，一部分人面兽心的资本家更凶相毕露，把检举他们的工人店员撵走，或竟加以殴打、杀害。福建协丰德水产进出口行资方陈荫荪，在利用解雇手段，威胁工人积极分子郑天来失败后，竟反噬郑天来有偷盗行为，即鼓动和他有亲戚关系的店员开会“斗争”直至逼死郑天来。不法资本家这种迫害店员工人的暴行，在其他地区也曾不断发生，仅据最近一个多月来极不完全的统计，在天津，沈阳、杭州、武汉、无锡、南京、吉林等地，即先后发生二十多起。在这些工人店员中（有个别工属），有的是被逼自杀的，有的是被资方用铁锤打死，厨刀砍死，或用绳勒死的。不法资本家的这种无耻暴行，已经足以证明资产阶级的进攻达到了怎样疯狂的程度，对于这样疯狂已极的不法资本家，是必须予以严惩的。
    不法资本家对于坦白检举运动的破坏抵抗，不管怎样狂妄，但他们所玩弄的这许多阴谋伎俩，可以断言，是必定而且很多已经遭到可耻的失败。杭州福华第一丝厂工人团结打败资方以“停工”手段抵抗运动的阴谋，以及拒绝受贿一亿元的店员程连荣的模范行动，都是对于不法资本家狂妄抵抗的有力反击。天津发动工人店员的经验证明，只要工人店员充分发动起来，组织起来，再狡猾的不法资本家也只好低头认罪。
    为了彻底打败不法资本家的狂妄抵抗，首先，在没有把私营企业工人店员普遍发动起来的地区应立即大力发动工人店员；在工人店员已经发动起来的地区，应即抓住店员工作最薄弱的环节，例如那些和资方有亲戚朋友关系的店员，特别是高级职员，把他们全部发动起来投入战斗。由于工人店员是最摸资本家“底”的人，因而，发动他们乃是继续巩固和壮大战斗队伍，完全孤立和打败不法资本家的一个重要环节。其次对于一切敢于破坏抵抗坦白检举运动的不法资本家，必须要求人民政府予以法纪制裁；而对于工商联所属的同业公会，如有胆敢阻碍运动开展的，则应加以改组。同时在各阶层人民群众中，还应该继续加强宣传工作，揭发奸商的罪行，使反击资产阶级的猖狂进攻真正形成广泛群众性的运动，以取得运动的彻底胜利。
