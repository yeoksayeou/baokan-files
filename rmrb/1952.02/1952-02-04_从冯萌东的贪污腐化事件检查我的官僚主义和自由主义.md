Examining My Bureaucracy and Liberalism Based on Feng Mengdong's Embezzlement and Corruption Incident
	Zhang Xingwen, Deputy Director of the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau

	Editor's Note: Feng Mengdong, the former Director of the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau and a Communist Party member, abused his power, concealed enemy property, embezzled public funds, and became corrupt. In the summer of 1949, Feng Mengdong, using his position as Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hangzhou Military Control Commission's Political Affairs Department, concealed a "Buick" car, enemy property that had been sealed by the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Public Security Department. He also stole and sold a car in Hangzhou. Feng Mengdong also raised over 96 million yuan through donations to establish the Folk Art Troupe and used other illegal means to raise funds for the Folk Art Troupe. After the local Party committee discovered these wrongdoings of Feng Mengdong, it immediately educated him. However, Feng Mengdong not only showed no sign of repentance but also attempted to alter accounts, destroy receipts, and "struggle against" those who reported him. To uphold Party discipline, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee decided to expel him from the Party. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government also submitted a request to the East China Military and Political Committee for approval to dismiss him from his post and bring him to justice. This is a self-criticism made by Zhang Xingwen, Deputy Director of the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau and a Communist Party member, based on the lessons learned from this incident.

	The mistakes committed by Feng Mengdong are extremely serious. In fact, Feng Mengdong's desire for personal enjoyment had existed for a long time. Before entering the city, Feng Mengdong paid attention to pursuing personal "status" and "treatment"; after entering the city, this thinking further developed. He became arrogant and complacent, regarded himself as a "meritorious official," did not participate in Party organizational life, did not listen to the opinions of the masses, indulged in the praise and applause of certain people, and became "bosom buddies" with those who flattered him. As a result, he became corrupt and turned into a criminal who stole state property.

	We should learn a lesson from this painful incident:

	Feng Mengdong's degeneration and corruption occurred very early, but I did not realize it until after June of last year. Although Feng Mengdong consistently adopted despicable means of deceiving superiors and concealing information to cover up his illegal activities, making it difficult for people to detect, my lack of political awareness and the existence of serious bureaucratic work style were also important reasons why Feng Mengdong was able to act willfully. When I was transferred to work at the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau in November 1949, the administrative leaders told me that Feng Mengdong's "meritorious official" mentality was very serious and that I should help him overcome this mentality in my work. This should have been enough to attract my attention and try to help Feng Mengdong improve; however, I did not do so for a long period. On the contrary, I ignored his mistakes and let him be. Feng Mengdong used "division of labor" as an excuse to ignore the work of the bureau and devoted himself to "benefit performances," "socializing," and speculation, etc., and I did not discover it in time. Feng Mengdong sometimes cursed his superiors and relevant departments because the budget (an extravagant budget) was not approved, and I did not make a serious criticism of him. Especially before May of last year, because I was responsible for land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the suburbs, Feng Mengdong thought that there was no restraint, so he spent all day in the Folk Art Troupe and did not care about the work in the bureau at all. At that time, many comrades in the bureau had opinions about this, but they did not dare to raise them. Some activists were attacked by Feng Mengdong because they dared to raise opinions. At this time, the morale of the cadres was very unstable. However, I was still busy working outside and did not understand these situations. Originally, these facts had already shown that Feng Mengdong was politically degenerating and deteriorating; however, I regarded Feng Mengdong's degenerate behavior as "small things." It can be seen that I did not have enough understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions at the Second Plenary Session: "Because of victory, pride, the idea of being a meritorious official, the idea of stagnation and not seeking progress, the idea of seeking pleasure and not being willing to live a hard life, may grow within the Party," and "There may be some Communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns, and they deserve the title of heroes in the face of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of bullets wrapped in sugar, and they will be defeated in the face of sugar-coated bullets. We must prevent this situation." Therefore, I did not actively and timely struggle against Feng Mengdong's wrong thoughts and actions and defend the interests of the Party and the people.

	After I returned to the Civil Affairs Bureau in June of last year and listened to the opinions of many cadres, I began to realize that Feng Mengdong's mistakes were very serious. In the report given to me by Yang Xueyan, the head of the Social Affairs Section, regarding Feng Mengdong's wrongdoings, there were many facts that I had once regarded as "small things." Now it seems that they were indeed acts of corruption, dereliction of duty, and violation of laws and regulations.

	From my one year of association with Feng Mengdong and my understanding of his wrongdoings, I deeply realized that in order to thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, Communist Party members, especially Communist Party members in leading positions, must actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, strictly draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, always vigilantly defend the interests of the Party, and resolutely overcome bureaucratic and liberal attitudes. All facts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy must be raised to a principled level for criticism. Only in this way can we further transform ourselves and do a good job in the Party's work in this movement.

### 从冯萌东的贪污腐化事件检查我的官僚主义和自由主义

    从冯萌东的贪污腐化事件检查我的官僚主义和自由主义
    杭州市人民政府民政局副局长  张星文
    编者按：原杭州市人民政府民政局局长、共产党员冯萌东，滥用职权，隐匿敌产，挪用公款，堕落腐化。一九四九年夏，冯萌东曾利用杭州市军管会政务部民政处处长的名义，隐匿已被上海市军管会公安部查封的敌产“别克”牌汽车一辆。又在杭州盗卖汽车一辆。冯萌东还向各方募捐九千六百多万元，创办民艺剧团；并用其他非法手段，为民艺剧团筹集资金。当地党委发现冯萌东这些错误行为后，立即予以教育。但冯萌东不仅没有悔改之意，还企图涂改账目，消灭单据，“斗争”检举他的人。为严肃党纪，中共浙江省委会决定开除其党籍。浙江省人民政府并呈请华东军政委员会批准，将他撤职法办。这是杭州市人民政府民政局副局长、共产党员张星文根据这一事件的教训，所作的自我检讨。
    冯萌东所犯的错误是极其严重的。实际上，冯萌东贪图个人享受的思想已存在很久。入城以前，冯萌东就注意追求个人的“地位”、“待遇”；入城以后，这种思想有了进一步的发展。他骄傲自满，以“功臣”自居，不参加党的组织生活，不倾听群众的意见，沉醉于某些人对他的捧场叫好声中，并和那些捧场者成为“莫逆之交”。以致贪污腐化，变成了盗窃国家财富的罪人。
    我们应该从这一沉痛的事件中，记取教训：
    冯萌东的堕落腐化行为发生得很早，我直到去年六月以后才发觉。虽然冯萌东一贯采取欺上瞒下的卑鄙手段，掩饰他的非法活动，使人不易发觉；但是，我的政治警觉性不高，存在着严重的官僚主义作风，也是使冯萌东得以为所欲为的重要原因。一九四九年十一月我调到杭州市人民政府民政局工作时，行政领导方面曾告诉我，冯萌东的“功臣”情绪很严重，应在工作中帮助他克服这种情绪。这照理已足够引起我的注意，从而设法帮助冯萌东进步；而我在较长的时期内，却没有这样去作。相反的，对他的错误不问不闻，听之任之。冯萌东以“分工”为名，不管局内工作，成天专心致力于“义演”“交际”以及买空卖空等等的勾当，而我没有及时发觉。冯萌东有时因预算（铺张浪费的预算）未被批准，便谩骂上级及有关部门，而我没有对他提出严正的批评。尤其在去年五月以前，因我在郊区负责土地改革和镇压反革命工作，冯萌东更以为没有了约束，成天钻在民艺剧团里，根本不管局内工作，对此，当时局内很多同志都有意见，但不敢提出来。有些积极分子因为敢于提意见，而受到了冯萌东的打击。这时，干部的情绪是很不安定的。但我仍在外面忙忙碌碌地工作，不了解这些情况。本来，这些事实，已经说明冯萌东在政治上堕落蜕化；但我却把冯萌东的堕落行为当作是些“小事情”，可见我对毛主席在二中全会上所指示的“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长”，“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况”，没有足够的认识。因而我没有积极地并及时地同冯萌东的错误思想行为进行斗争，保卫党和人民的利益。
    去年六月我回到民政局，听取了许多干部的意见后，才开始认识到冯萌东的错误非常严重。社会科科长杨雪岩给我的关于冯萌东错误行为的报告中，就有不少事实曾经被我看作“小事情”，现在看起来，那的确是贪污渎职、违法乱纪的行为。
    从我和冯萌东相处一年及对他的错误行为的认识过程中，使我深深地体会到：要彻底肃清资产阶级的思想影响，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，共产党员、特别是负责领导工作的共产党员，必须积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，严格划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，时时警惕地保卫党的利益，坚决克服官僚主义和自由主义态度，对于一切贪污、浪费、官僚主义的事实都提高到原则高度来加以批判。只有这样，才能在这一运动中进一步改造自己、作好党的工作。
