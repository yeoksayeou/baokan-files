    On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucratism
    Wuhan Worker Militia Strengthens Security Work
    Guaranteeing Surveillance of Corrupt Elements and Unscrupulous Merchants
    The Wuhan City Worker Militia General Headquarters convened a city-wide meeting of its members on the 10th, mobilizing militia members to actively participate in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism. Over five thousand worker militia members from various factories, enterprises, and government offices attended. Zhao Min, chairman of the Wuhan City Federation of Trade Unions and concurrently captain of the Worker Militia General Headquarters, called on the members to boldly expose illegal capitalists. All worker militia members passed a pledge to actively participate in the movement, guaranteeing that every worker militia member would become an active propagandist, mobilizing all workers to participate in the movement; guaranteeing active investigation of materials, boldly exposing corrupt elements, and revealing the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants; guaranteeing surveillance of corrupt elements to prevent sabotage, evasion, and resistance, and safeguarding the security of factories, enterprises, and government offices. After the meeting, all worker militia members held a parade.
    After the Seizure of Taiyuan Private Silian Construction Company
    All Workers Were Introduced to Work at the Steel Plant
    Su Xuemin, the manager of the Taiyuan private Silian Construction Company, frequently used despicable and base methods such as bribery, feasting, playing mahjong, and whoring to lure state personnel into stealing state property. According to preliminary materials, he corrupted twenty-three cadres from eight organizations, stealing state property worth over 1 billion yuan. Su Xuemin was laden with crimes, but during this movement, he refused to confess and instead formed "alliances of defense" everywhere, disrupting the movement. On January 26th, the People's Government arrested Su Xuemin according to the law and froze all assets of the Silian Construction Company.
    After the seizure of the Silian Construction Company, the trade union sent people to negotiate with the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant to ensure that the workers would not lose their jobs. As a result, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant agreed to introduce all workers of the Silian Construction Company to work at the Steel Plant after being reviewed by the labor introduction agency. The procedures for introduction are currently being processed, and they will be able to start work soon. All workers of the Silian Construction Company were very happy and moved after hearing this news. They further realized the concern of the People's Government for the workers. Worker Qu Chengyuan said: "With the government supporting us and making decisions for us, we have now become workers in a state-owned factory. We must guarantee that we actively help the government and expose all illegal acts of cutting corners in the projects undertaken by the Silian Construction Company." This living fact also educated the employees and shop assistants in private enterprises in Taiyuan City. Everyone eliminated their concerns about losing their jobs and bravely participated in the exposure movement.
    Nanjing Industrial and Commercial Circles Hold Mobilization Meeting
    People's Government Arrests Eight Unscrupulous Merchants on the Spot
    One hundred and forty-three industries in Nanjing held a mobilization meeting on the 6th. More than 500,000 people listened to the live broadcast of the meeting outside the venue. The meeting received more than 20,000 letters exposing and accusing the crimes of illegal merchants.
    In Nanjing City, over the past month, the masses have exposed and the industrial and commercial circles have initially confessed to nearly 40,000 cases of illegal merchants. Among them, the bribes paid by unscrupulous merchants in only eighteen industries, such as construction, hardware, water and electricity, and trees and bamboo, amounted to more than 3.39 billion yuan. The exorbitant profits gained by unscrupulous merchants and the losses suffered by state property cannot yet be statistically determined.
    At the meeting, the presidium accepted the demands of the masses and named twelve unscrupulous merchants with serious crimes, including Chen Wenhuan, manager of Xinzhong Construction Company, Zhang Zhiming, manager of Anping Water and Electricity Company, and Li Changfu, manager of Da Lai Wood Company, to come to the stage to confess in public. Among them, Chen Wenhuan and other eight unscrupulous merchants hesitated and refused to confess. At the unanimous request of the masses, the People's Government arrested them on the spot. Li Changfu and other four were willing to confess, and the People's Government gave them a deadline of two days to make a thorough confession. Ke Qingshi, on behalf of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government, announced: All illegal elements in the city's industrial and commercial circles are ordered to make a thorough confession within five days.
    Xi'an Democratic Parties Hold Mobilization Meeting
    The Shaanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Xi'an Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee jointly invited more than 500 members of the Xi'an local organizations of various democratic parties to hold a symposium on February 9 to discuss participation in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence. Wang Feng, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Zhang Jiafu, Minister of the Propaganda Department, were invited to participate. At the meeting, Li Xiangjiu, chairman of the Xi'an Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, announced the plan of the Xi'an Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association to participate in the movement. The plan stipulates that problematic industrial and commercial members, especially committee members, should be inspired to take the lead in confessing, each member group should make a covenant, and each member should make a personal plan to ensure that the problems are explained clearly within the time limit prescribed by the People's Government. The person in charge of the Xi'an branch of the China Democratic League and the person in charge of the preparatory committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang also stated in their speeches that they would mobilize all members to actively participate in this struggle.
