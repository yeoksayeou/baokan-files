Shanghai Private Qixin Yarn Factory Capitalists
Persistently Steal National Raw Cotton

    The Shanghai private Qixin Yarn Factory was entrusted by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, East China Branch, to process yarn on commission, in order to help it overcome difficulties. The amount of yarn processed on commission once reached three-quarters of the factory's actual operating spindles, thus gradually improving its business situation. However, the factory's acting manager, Zhu Lide, and factory director, Tang Mengxiong, had extremely poor management styles and consistently stole commissioned cotton. Starting in August 1950, they intensified their efforts, using purchased cotton waste to impersonate sub-grade Jingyang cotton and mixed it into the commissioned cotton, systematically stealing people's property. According to a tip-off, the East China Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation initially discovered that the factory had embezzled a total of 825 dan of commissioned raw cotton from October 1950 to October 1951. The theft of high-grade commissioned cotton averaged five to six dan per day, with a maximum of over 15 dan and a minimum of about two to three dan.
    The factory's embezzlement of commissioned cotton was as follows: In February 1951, the entire factory's self-spun and self-sold cotton yarn ("Bi" grade 20-count yarn 120 pieces, 20-count yarn 12 pieces, 32-count yarn 20 pieces) required a total of 626.24 dan of cotton. According to the daily warehouse report at the time, the total cotton in stock for the entire month (including the previous month's surplus and this month's purchases) was 451.78 dan. Among them, there were 213.37 dan of raw cotton for 32-count and 20-count yarn. After deducting 132.16 dan for 32 pieces of cotton yarn, there was a surplus of 81.21 dan. Adding the "Bi" grade 20-count yarn raw cotton, there was a total of 319.62 dan of "Bi" grade 20-count yarn raw cotton. However, the production of 120 pieces of "Bi" grade 20-count yarn required 495.60 dan of cotton, resulting in a shortage of 175.98 dan of raw cotton, of which 79.11 dan was embezzled from the commissioned cotton. The embezzlement situation in other months was largely the same.
    In terms of stealing and replacing commissioned raw cotton, cotton waste was used to impersonate sub-grade Jingyang cotton and mixed in. For example, on August 14, 1950, the cotton composition allocated by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation was 100% 7/8-inch American cotton; however, according to the factory's workshop diary, 7/8-inch American cotton accounted for only 25% of the blending composition, and the remaining 75% of American cotton was entirely stolen and replaced, with an additional 10% of bad cotton mixed in.
    Under the multiple support of state-owned trading companies in production, the private Qixin Yarn Factory deceived the government, violated contract regulations, and continuously stole the people's state property. This kind of despicable behavior of the bourgeoisie is absolutely intolerable. The case is now under trial by the Shanghai People's Court.

### 上海私营启新纱厂资本家  一贯偷盗国家原棉

    上海私营启新纱厂资本家
    一贯偷盗国家原棉
    上海市私营启新纱厂由中国花纱布公司华东区公司委托代纺，以扶植它度过困难。代纺量曾达这个厂实开纱锭的四分之三，从而业务情况渐趋好转。但这个厂的代经理朱立德、厂长唐孟雄，经营作风极为恶劣，一贯地盗窃代纺棉花。从一九五○年八月份起，更变本加厉，以收购下脚棉花冒充次泾阳棉，混入代纺棉中，有计划地盗窃人民财产。华东区花纱布公司根据密告，初步查获这个厂从一九五○年十月到一九五一年十月，盗用代纺原棉共计八百二十五担。偷换代纺优级棉，平均每天达五、六担之多，最高曾达十五担以上，最低也有二、三担左右。
    这个厂盗用代纺棉花的情况如下：一九五一年二月份，全厂自纺自售的棉纱（“比”级廿支纱一百二十件，廿支纱十二件，卅二支纱二十件），共需用棉六二六·二四担。据当时栈务日报表记载：全月共存棉（包括上月余存及本月购入）四五一·七八担。其中有卅二支及廿支纱原棉二一三·三七担，除去三十二件棉纱用棉一三二·一六担外，尚余八一·二一担；加上“比”级廿支纱原棉，共有“比”级廿支纱原棉三一九·六二担。但“比”级廿支纱纺制一二○件，需用棉四九五·六○担，计缺原棉一七五·九八担，其中盗用了代纺棉七九·一一担。其他月份的盗窃情况大都如此。
    在偷换代纺原棉方面，是用下脚花衣，冒称次泾阳棉混充。例如一九五○年八月十四日，花纱布公司配棉成份为八分之七吋美棉百分之一百；而该厂工务日记所载，和花成份八分之七吋美棉仅占百分之二十五，其余百分之七十五的美棉，竟被悉数抽盗调换，另外又掺入坏棉百分之十。
    私营启新纱厂在国营贸易公司多方扶助生产下，竟欺诈政府，违反合约规定，不断地盗窃人民国家财产，这种资产阶级的卑鄙行为，是决不能容忍的。现在这个案件已由上海市人民法院审理中。
