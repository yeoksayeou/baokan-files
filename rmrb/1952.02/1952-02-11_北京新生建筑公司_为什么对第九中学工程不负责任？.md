    Beijing XinSheng Construction Company
    Why is it Irresponsible for the No. 9 Middle School Project?
    Editor: Last May, the Beijing Public XinSheng Construction Company contracted to build thirty classrooms for Beijing No. 9 Middle School at a cost of 600 million yuan. However, XinSheng Company arbitrarily subcontracted the project to the foreman Tian Xiangnan. Tian Xiangnan cut corners and used substandard materials, resulting in very poor construction quality. Now, the foundation of the eastern classrooms has subsided, with brick seams as wide as five centimeters, and cracks have appeared in the walls. According to inspections by engineer Hu Qingchang and others from the XinSheng Company's design department, there are as many as eighteen similar problems. The person in charge of XinSheng Company does not pay any attention to this matter and even stated: XinSheng Company has undertaken many projects; your money is little and it is not a priority. Although the principal and director of studies of No. 9 Middle School have discussed it with them three times, they have repeatedly delayed and have not started to solve the problem. They have not investigated the foreman Tian Xiangnan either. We believe that XinSheng Company should quickly inspect this project and deal with the relevant derelict personnel.

### 北京新生建筑公司  为什么对第九中学工程不负责任？

    北京新生建筑公司
    为什么对第九中学工程不负责任？
    编辑同志：去年五月，北京公营新生建筑公司承造北京市第九中学三十间教室的工程，工价六亿元。但新生公司竟擅自把这项工程转包给把头田象南。田象南偷工减料，工程质量很坏。现在，东面教室的地基已下沉，砖缝最大的有五公分，墙壁发生裂痕。据新生公司设计部工程师胡庆昌等人检查，类似这种毛病有十八项之多。新生公司负责人对这件事毫不重视，居然表示：新生公司承修的工程很多，你们的钱少，不是重点。虽经第九中学校长、教导主任连去三次商量，但他们一再拖延，不着手解决这个问题。他们对把头田象南也没有追究。我们以为新生公司应迅速检查这个工程，处理有关的渎职人员。
