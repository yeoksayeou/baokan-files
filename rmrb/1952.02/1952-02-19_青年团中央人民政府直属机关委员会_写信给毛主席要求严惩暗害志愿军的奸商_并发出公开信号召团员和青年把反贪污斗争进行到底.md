[本报讯] The Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China's Central People's Government's Directly Subordinate Organs Committee wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on February 18th, requesting the People's Government to severely punish 奸商 who harmed the Volunteer Army. It also issued an open letter to all League members and youth of directly subordinate organs, calling on all League members and the broad masses of youth to thoroughly recognize the class essence of the bourgeoisie – harming others for self-interest and being solely driven by profit – from the exposed criminal facts of the 奸商, thereby drawing a clear line with the bourgeoisie and resolutely carrying the anti-corruption struggle through to the end.

The letter from the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China's Central People's Government's Directly Subordinate Organs Committee to Chairman Mao stated: "Under your wise leadership, the 11,000 League members and 15,000 youth of the Central People's Government's directly subordinate organs are fully engaged in encircling and annihilating major corrupt elements and major thieves. In this fierce struggle, each of us has received profound and vivid class education, further recognizing the essence of the bourgeoisie and their criminal acts of launching frenzied attacks against us over the past three years. We deeply hate those illegal capitalists and major corrupt elements, and we are determined to fight to the end and never withdraw until complete victory.

Not long ago, we visited the 'Korean Frontline Artifacts Exhibition,' and we personally saw how the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army cherished the property of the motherland: they were reluctant to discard broken carrying poles, and even used them to make tools for scrubbing pots; under extremely difficult conditions of medical equipment at the front, they tried every possible means to manufacture substitutes; the shovels they used were used until only the handle remained. This noble quality of the Volunteer Army has deeply educated every League member and youth. Therefore, we are constantly thinking: how can we transport more things to the front? How can we send the best things in the country to the Volunteer Army? How can we ensure that the Volunteer Army receives better food and sufficient medicine? Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and yourself, our ideas are being realized step by step in the national patriotic production increase and economization campaign.

However, after reading the recent reports in the People's Daily exposing the crimes of the 奸商 who harmed the Volunteer Army, we were filled with indescribable anger. Who would have thought that the blood and sweat money accumulated by the people of the whole country to support our most beloved Volunteer Army was stolen and swindled by 奸商 in Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenyang and other places. These 奸商 stole the people's consolation money by cutting corners, using inferior goods to impersonate good goods, and raising prices; they passed off fake medicines as genuine medicines, made 'first aid kits' with toxic cotton, passed off bad raincoats as good raincoats, and made canned food from rotten meat to poison our Volunteer Army – our 'most lovable people.' Such unscrupulous, inhuman behavior of the 奸商 directly helped American imperialism to harm our most beloved people, causing heroic Volunteer Army comrades to be disabled when they should not have been, and to sacrifice when they should not have. The 奸商 are simply man-eating beasts, traitors to the people of the motherland, accomplices of American imperialism, murderers who harmed the Volunteer Army, and enemies of the people of the whole country. Therefore, we cannot tolerate them running rampant on the soil of our beloved New China. We firmly support the accusations of the People's Volunteer Army and request the People's Government to severely punish these heartless and lungless 奸商 and recover the ill-gotten gains they illegally stole. This is the righteous sanction of the people of the whole country against them, and a necessary measure to guarantee the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

Respected Chairman Mao: We have organized all League members and youth of the Central People's Government's directly subordinate organs to seriously study the recent reports and editorials in the People's Daily on this matter, to educate ourselves through these specific facts, and to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda among the broad masses, mobilizing all the people to expose 奸商 who harmed the Volunteer Army, as well as the major corrupt elements who colluded directly with these 奸商.

We assure you that under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Central People's Government's Directly Subordinate Organs Committee, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the 'fortresses' that the bourgeoisie has placed inside our state organs, eliminate major thieves, and defend the construction of our New Democracy and the complete victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. We pay you our highest respects!"

    青年团中央人民政府直属机关委员会
    写信给毛主席要求严惩暗害志愿军的奸商
    并发出公开信号召团员和青年把反贪污斗争进行到底
    【本报讯】新民主主义青年团中央人民政府直属机关委员会，在二月十八日写信给毛主席，要求人民政府严厉惩办暗害志愿军的奸商；并发出给直属机关全体青年团员和青年的公开信，号召全体青年团员和广大青年，从已揭发出的奸商的罪恶事实中，彻底认清资产阶级损人利己、唯利是图的阶级本质，从而与资产阶级划清界限，坚决把反贪污斗争进行到底。
    青年团中央人民政府直属机关委员会写给毛主席的信说：“我们中央人民政府直属机关的一万一千个青年团员和一万五千个青年，在您的英明领导之下，正以全力围歼大贪污犯、大盗窃犯。在这次激烈的斗争中，我们每一个人都深刻而生动地受到了阶级教育，进一步认识资产阶级的本质，以及三年来向我们猖狂进攻的罪恶行为。我们对于那些不法的资本家和大贪污犯是深恶痛绝的，我们决心战斗到底，不获全胜，绝不收兵。
    不久以前，我们参观过‘朝鲜前线实物展览’，我们亲眼看到英雄的中国人民志愿军是怎样爱护着祖国的财物：扁担断了舍不得抛弃，还利用它来做刷锅的工具；在前线医药设备极度困难的条件下，他们想尽了办法制造了代用品；他们使用的铁锹，一直用到只剩下一个柄。志愿军这种高贵的品质，深深地教育了我们每一个团员和青年。因此我们时刻在想：怎样才能多运些东西到前线去呢？怎样才能把国内最好的东西送给志愿军呢？怎样才能使志愿军得到较好的食品和足够的药品呢？我们这些想法，在中国共产党和您的英明领导之下，在全国人民爱国增产节约的运动中，正一步一步地实现着。
    但是在我们读了人民日报近几天来所揭露的奸商暗害志愿军的罪行后，我们激起了难以形容的愤怒。谁想到全国人民一点一滴积累起来支援我们最可爱的志愿军的血汗钱，竟被武汉、上海、沈阳等地的奸商们窃取盗骗。这些奸商们竟以偷工减料、劣货冒充好货、抬高价格等办法窃取了人民慰劳的款项；他们把假药冒充真药，把有毒的棉花做成‘救急包’，把坏雨衣冒充好雨衣，把臭肉做成罐头，来毒害我们的志愿军——我们‘最可爱的人’。奸商们这种丧尽天良、毫无人性的行为，直接帮助美帝国主义暗害了我们最可爱的人们，使英勇的志愿军同志不该残废的残废了，不该牺牲的牺牲了。奸商们简直是吃人的野兽，是祖国人民的叛徒，是美帝国主义的帮凶，是暗害志愿军的凶手，是我们全国人民的敌人。因此，我们丝毫不能容忍他们在我们可爱的新中国的国土上横行。我们坚决支持人民志愿军的控诉，请求人民政府严厉惩办这些狼心狗肺的奸商，追回他们非法盗窃的暴利。这是全国人民对他们的正义制裁，是保证抗美援朝胜利的必要措施。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们已经组织中央人民政府直属机关的全体团员和青年，认真学习人民日报近几天来有关这一方面的报道和社论，通过这些具体事实教育我们自己，并向广大群众进行广泛而深入的宣传，动员全体人民检举暗害志愿军的奸商，以及和这些奸商直接勾结的大贪污犯。
    我们向您保证：我们一定要在中国共产党中央人民政府直属机关委员会和青年团中央的直接领导下，坚决、彻底、干净、全部清除资产阶级安置在我们国家机关内部的‘堡垒’，清除大盗窃犯，保卫我们新民主主义的建设和抗美援朝的彻底胜利。我们向您致崇高的敬礼！”
