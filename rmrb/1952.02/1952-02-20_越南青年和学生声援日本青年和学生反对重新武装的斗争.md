Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: A dispatch from North Vietnam: The Vietnam Youth League, the Vietnam University Students' Union, and the Vietnam Secondary School Students' Union, in order to commemorate "Anti-Colonialism Struggle Day," sent a letter to the youth and students of Japan, the full text of which is as follows:

    On the occasion of February 21st, we, on behalf of the Vietnamese youth, extend to you our greetings of solidarity and friendship.

    Although the reactionary policies of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the French and British imperialists, have failed everywhere in the world, they are still frantically preparing for a new world war and intensifying their aggressive activities in Asia. They shamelessly signed a separate peace treaty with the Yoshida puppet government in order to rearm Japan, push the Japanese people into the abyss of militarism, and turn Japan into a reserve source of manpower and material resources and an important arsenal for their aggressive wars in Asia. Due to the united solidarity of the people of Asian countries, the powerful resistance of the people of the world, and especially the heroic struggle of the Japanese youth and people, their conspiracy is doomed to failure. The Vietnamese youth and people fought for four years under the most difficult conditions to smash the cruel shackles of Japanese fascism, and they have now been fighting for six years against the aggression of the French and American imperialists. They wholeheartedly support the Japanese people's struggle against suffering, against the fascist policies of the Yoshida government, against the American-dictated peace treaty, and for an independent, peaceful, and democratic Japan.

    The Vietnamese youth pledge to intensify their struggle to eliminate the French aggressors and American interventionists, so as to join you in smashing the imperialists' aggressive and war-mongering plots in Asia, and to defend our national independence and peace in Asia and the world.

    越南青年和学生声援日本青年和学生反对重新武装的斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】北越消息：越南青年联盟、越南大学学生联合会、越南中学学生联合会三团体为了迎接“反对殖民制度斗争日”，特致书日本的青年和学生，全文如下：
    兹值二月二十一日，我们代表越南青年向你们致以声援和友谊的敬礼。
    尽管美帝国主义者和他们的仆从法英帝国主义者的反动政策在世界各地都失败了，但是他们仍然在疯狂地准备新的世界战争，并加紧进行他们在亚洲的侵略活动。他们无耻地与吉田傀儡政府签订了单独和约，以便重新武装日本，把日本人民推入军国主义的深渊中，把日本变为一个人力和物力的后备来源和重要兵工厂，以供他们在亚洲进行侵略战争。由于亚洲各国人民的团结一致，由于世界各国人民的有力反抗，特别是由于日本青年和人民的英雄的斗争，他们的阴谋是注定要失败的。越南青年和人民曾在最艰苦的条件下为粉碎日本法西斯主义的残酷束缚而斗争了四年，他们现在又进行了六年反对法美帝国主义者的侵略的斗争。他们衷心地支持日本人民反对痛苦、反对吉田政府的法西斯政策、反对美国包办的和约和争取独立、和平与民主的日本的斗争。
    越南青年保证要加紧进行斗争，以消灭法国侵略者和美国干涉者，以便和你们并肩粉碎帝国主义者在亚洲的侵略和战争阴谋，保卫我们的民族独立以及亚洲和世界的和平。
