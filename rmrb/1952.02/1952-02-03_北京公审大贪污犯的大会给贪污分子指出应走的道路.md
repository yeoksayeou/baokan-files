    The Beijing Public Trial of Major Embezzlers Points Out the Path for Embezzlers
    Editor: After listening to the live broadcast of the "Beijing Public Trial of Major Embezzlers Conference" on February 1, I received a very profound education.

    Through this conference, I further realized the government's wise policy towards embezzlers. Thieving villains like Song Degui, who harmed the interests of the motherland and the people and resisted confession, were punished by the people's law. Those embezzlers who thoroughly confessed their problems to the people were granted exemption or reduction of punishment. We can clearly see from this that there are only two paths before embezzlers: one is a path to life, which is thorough confession; the other is a path to death, which is the path of Song Degui.

    I am now a university student in New China, and in the future, I will be a working cadre of New China. Although I have not yet committed any acts of embezzlement, I have strong exploiting class thoughts, a desire for personal enjoyment, and the hope of gaining without labor. Therefore, I must take practical action and throw myself into this fiery struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology, mobilize and expose embezzlers among my relatives and friends, so that they will bow their heads and admit their guilt, and assist the government in carrying out this revolutionary movement.

### 北京公审大贪污犯的大会给贪污分子指出应走的道路

    北京公审大贪污犯的大会给贪污分子指出应走的道路
    编辑同志：收听了二月一日“北京公审大贪污犯大会”的实况广播以后，我受到了极深刻的教育。
    通过这次大会，我更进一步地体会了政府对贪污分子的英明政策。像宋德贵那样危害祖国人民利益、抗拒坦白的蟊贼，受到了人民法纪的制裁。那些彻底向人民交代自己的问题的贪污分子，就得到了免刑或减刑。我们从这里很明显地看出，摆在贪污分子面前的只有两条出路：一条是活路，那就是彻底坦白；另一条是死路，是宋德贵的道路。
    我现在是新中国的大学生，将来是一个新中国的工作干部。虽然现在我还没有贪污的事实和行为，但是我有浓厚的剥削阶级思想，有贪图个人享受，希望不劳而食的思想。因此，我要拿实际行动，投入这一火热的斗争中，清除资产阶级思想，动员、检举自己的亲友中的贪污分子，让他们低头认罪，协助政府搞好这一革命运动。  熊任飞
