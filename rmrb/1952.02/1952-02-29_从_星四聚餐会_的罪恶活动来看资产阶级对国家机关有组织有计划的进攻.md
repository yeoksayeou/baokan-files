From the Criminal Activities of the "Star Four Dinner Party": An Organized and Planned Attack by the Bourgeoisie on State Organs
By our reporter Lin Li

In Chongqing, I interviewed the responsible comrades handling the "Star Four Dinner Party" case, spoke with some lawless elements who had initially confessed to participating in the "Star Four Dinner Party," and reviewed documents related to the case, as well as letters of denunciation from the people, confessions from coerced participants, interrogation records of the ringleaders, and the four records of the "Star Four Dinner Party's" secret gatherings. All written and oral materials prove that the bourgeoisie's attack on the people's democratic regime and the working class was organized, planned, and led.

The private iron and machinery industry in Chongqing was entirely restored and developed with the support of the People's Government. Before liberation, Chongqing's private iron and machinery industry had declined to a dilapidated state, "barely surviving," under the joint strangulation of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. Like the bourgeoisie in other parts of the country, the Chongqing bourgeoisie had neither the strength nor the possibility of resisting the flood of American goods. Many factories relied on selling factory buildings, furniture, and even machine tools to survive. For example, the "Shanghai Machine Factory" had more than two hundred workers before the Japanese surrender, but by the time of liberation, only seven or eight workers remained to watch the factory. In the two years since liberation, the People's Government, in order to support national industry, has provided these factories with loans totaling more than 28.6 billion yuan, and processing orders worth nearly 300 billion yuan. The "Shanghai Machine Factory" alone received loans of more than 2 billion yuan. The bosses of these factories, seeing their "businesses" restored and developed, immediately revealed their sinister faces. They shouted "Long Live the People's Government" on one hand, while on the other, they tried every means to attack the People's Government. As Chen Youxin and Mao Yike, directors and managers of the Shanghai Machine Factory, said: "I can ask for whatever price I want, and you have to give it to me, otherwise, I won't do it." The exorbitant profits of this factory were more than 100% to 200% higher than the cost. In order to attack the people's democratic regime in a more planned way, these factory bosses organized the "Star Four Dinner Party."

The "Star Four Dinner Party" was initially initiated by the heads of six large factories in Chongqing's private iron and machinery industry, and later absorbed six medium-sized factories. At the beginning of its formation, only a state-owned factory and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway placed orders and commissioned processing in private factories. At that time, the "Star Four Dinner Party" targeted this state-owned factory, attempting to reap illegal profits by monopolizing processing orders. For this shameful purpose, it colluded with Zhou Shaowen, the production section chief of the basic construction office of this state-owned factory, and Chen Songbai, an outsourcing engineer, etc., and pulled Sun Jishi, deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, who was responsible for supervising and guiding processing order work, into the "Dinner Party." They also brought in Qian Shaowu, a section chief of a certain department of the Southwest Industrial Department's management office, as their inside source for obtaining and monopolizing industrial raw materials. With all these arrangements in place, the "Star Four Dinner Party" opened its bloody mouth and launched a large-scale attack on the people's democratic regime. Under Zhou Shaowen's manipulation, the outsourcing projects of this state-owned factory were never contracted through bidding, but were handed over to the "Star Four Dinner Party" for "unified distribution." Sun Jishi, deputy director of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, even guaranteed at the third meeting of the "Star Four Dinner Party" that bidding would not be adopted in the future, but the "unified distribution" method "created" by Zhou Shaowen would be used. The so-called "unified distribution" was essentially handing over the state's commissioned processing and orders to this group of lawless capitalists for distribution. After the robbers of the "Star Four Dinner Party" obtained the privilege of unified distribution of state processing orders, they uniformly raised wages, uniformly raised material consumption costs, uniformly cut corners, and uniformly delayed completion dates. Under this series of "unifications," state property suffered incalculable losses, seriously affecting the progress of economic construction. According to the confessed materials of some members of the "Star Four Dinner Party" alone, they embezzled more than 20 billion yuan of state assets from this one state-owned factory alone.

With the recovery and development of the national economy, the organization of the "Star Four Dinner Party" also expanded. Shortly after the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began, the "Star Four Dinner Party" appointed its "general" Wu Zongkai to organize the "Star Five Dinner Party." Wu Zongkai was the manager of Ronghua Machine Factory, known as the "Ironwork Big Boss." He gathered Hongfali, Chuanchang, Gongxin, Rongxin, Zhang Duansheng, Zhihua, Hengda, Xiecheng and other nine factories, and bribed the deputy director of the Southwest Railway Bureau's Locomotive Department, forming a monopoly organization to encircle the Railway Bureau and monopolize the processing orders for railway equipment. How much state property they have stolen through this organization in the past year or so is still unclear. It is only known that in the project of making thirty-one sets of turnouts, raising wages and overreporting materials alone caused the state a direct loss of more than 740 million yuan.

Ships are the main means of transportation in the Southwest region. The ship repair and shipbuilding projects are quite large. Under the instigation of Shi Shuliu, manager of Tianxing Machine Factory, the heads of fourteen factories formed the "Star Six Dinner Party" to undertake ship repair and shipbuilding projects (some of which do not specialize in ship repair and shipbuilding). In the winter of 1951, Gao Gongmao, the ringleader of the "Star Four Dinner Party," personally came forward again and combined Chuanchang, Tianxing, Xiexing, Hezong, Gongxin, Hongchang and other six companies of the "Star Six Dinner Party," plus Minsheng, Chuanjiang, Jianxin, Xintai, Yuanji, and Huixing, to form a "Shipbuilding Group" specializing in monopolizing the state's ship repair and shipbuilding projects. This "Shipbuilding Group" once fraudulently obtained the "approval" of the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau, and also absorbed the state-owned Chuanjiang Shipyard to participate, and bribed Sun Qi, the chief of the Inspection Section of the Navigation Bureau. Therefore, its activities became more blatant and unscrupulous. This "Shipbuilding Group" once submitted "Twelve Opinions" to the Navigation Bureau, requesting the Navigation Bureau to formulate "business licenses" and hand them over to the "Shipbuilding Group" to discuss and distribute the state's ship repair and shipbuilding projects. It required the Navigation Bureau to stipulate that when shipping companies and state-owned enterprises holding water transportation tools repaired and built ships, they should not disperse the work in more than one factory. It required shipping companies and state-owned enterprises holding water transportation tools to submit repair and construction projects on time so that they could "produce in a planned manner." It not only required state organs that currently hold water transportation tools to quickly list detailed ship repair lists, but also required the state to report the "planned shipbuilding plan" to them by filling out forms, "otherwise, all member factories will refuse to repair and build." How the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau handled these "opinions" is still unknown, but we can see from here how crazy the bourgeoisie's attack has become! They not only want to squeeze out small and medium-sized businesses all at once, but also want to turn the people's state organs into tools for them to seek monopoly profits!

In the winter of 1950, the news that the Central People's Government decided to manufacture textile machines in major cities across the country reached Chongqing. Yu Guiquan, the ringleader of the "Star Four Dinner Party," and Yin Renji, manager of Shunchang Factory and Xinmin Machine Factory, immediately convened an emergency meeting of the heads of Xiechang, Hezong, Huigong, Dalai, Dachuan, Shanghai, Cooperation, China and other eleven factories. The meeting was chaired by Yu Guiquan. He said that to win the government's textile machine project, it is necessary to first "consolidate the organization and strengthen unity." The heads of the factories attending the meeting unanimously expressed their "firm support for the organization and firm determination to strive for the manufacture of textile machines." They then established the "Eleven Factory Liaison Office," with Li Hanhu, manager of Cooperative Hardware Factory, as the general secretary to handle general liaison matters; Yin Renji and other five people presided over "internal affairs"; and Yu Guiquan, Shao Renli, and Mao Yike were "fully authorized representatives to Beijing to negotiate the contracting of textile machines." They also decided that after winning the textile machine project, they would ask the central government to "give special consideration" to the textile machine floor price formulated in East China. They decided that the specific amount of care should be: the material cost should be 30% higher than that in East China; the labor cost should be 20% higher than the floor price in East China; and the subsidy for sample and special tools should be increased by 10%. Their regular liaison location was 168 Minguo Road. From the establishment of the "Eleven Factory Liaison Office" to the project being in hand, they held thirty-six meetings. The various unit prices of machine parts discussed by people in Beijing must be brought here for research; various contracts must be approved here; project tasks are uniformly distributed by them; raw materials used are uniformly purchased by them, and even the specific figures for cutting corners are uniformly arranged by them. After Yu Guiquan and others returned to Chongqing from Beijing, they specially convened a meeting to "summarize experience and deploy tasks." At the meeting, Yu Guiquan proposed that a certain project "required 80,000 workers in Beijing, but we strive to deliver the goods with 60,000 or even 40,000 workers." At this meeting, Yu Guiquan also specifically reviewed the shortcomings in the negotiation work in Beijing, which was so-called "insufficient prior preparation" and "poor contact with the Ministry of Industry." The meeting therefore decided: "In the future, we must get closer to the Ministry of Industry" in order to "develop towards Beijing." Yin Renji also reminded everyone: "We must ensure the confidentiality of everything in the organization." Under the policy of "getting closer to the Ministry of Industry," they requested the Southwest Industrial Department to establish the "Southwest District Public-Private Machine Factory Textile Machine Manufacturing Technology Committee." They specially promoted a certain deputy minister of the Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee to be the chairman, and they themselves served as the vice chairmen. But the actual work was in their hands. This committee was just a public name change for the illegal "Eleven Factory Liaison Office."

The above four organizations were all formed in response to the industrial processing and industrial orders of the national economic construction departments. At the end of 1951, the "Star Four Dinner Party" also contacted the accountants of eight factories, including Zhendan, China, Xinmin, Dachuan, Dalai, Shunchang, Hengshun, and Dachang, to form an "Accountant Symposium." Under the cover of "unified accounting," this "symposium" specialized in experimenting with evading national taxes and attacking national tax personnel, preparing to implement it in the same way in all member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" in the future. Not long after this organization was established, the struggle of the people across the country against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence began.

The "Star Four Dinner Party" has become the core of the bourgeoisie's attack on the state, and has developed from the initial 12 factories to 40 to 50 factories (half of which are peripheral and half of which are core), from one organization to five organizations, and from a mixed organization to several professional organizations. The organization of the "Star Four Dinner Party" is extremely tight. People who join this organization must be individually introduced, passed by the general meeting, and then go through a certain period of "attendance" before they can become official "members." It organized various different peripheries, the purpose of which was to cultivate member factories and strive for legality when conditions were ripe.

Judging from the development process and current situation of the "Star Four Dinner Party," it is no longer a purely economic organization that steals state property, but an ambitious group with political conspiracies. It turned the iron and machinery industry association into its puppet, and it has the power to "designate" the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles in the Chongqing Municipal People's Congress. Coupled with the traitors it bought and the "sit-in spies" sent into state organs, several government departments have become tools for it to grab huge profits. If today there are still people who insist that the bourgeoisie has no attacking organization and cannot have any rampant attacks, then please take a look at the crimes of the "Star Four Dinner Party"!

    从“星四聚餐会”的罪恶活动来看资产阶级对国家机关有组织有计划的进攻
    本报记者  林里
    在重庆，我访问了处理“星四聚餐会”案件的负责同志，和一些初步坦白了的参加“星四聚餐会”的不法分子谈了话，查看了有关这一案件的文件和人民群众的检举信件、胁从分子的坦白书、审讯首脑分子的记录和“星四聚餐会”秘密集会的四本记录。所有书面材料和口头材料都证明：资产阶级向人民民主政权和工人阶级的进攻，是有组织、有计划、有领导地进行的。
    重庆的私营钢铁机器业，完全是靠着人民政府的扶助而恢复、发展起来的。解放以前，重庆私营钢铁机器业在蒋美联合绞杀之下，已经衰败到破破烂烂，“一息仅存”了。重庆的资产阶级和全国其他地区的资产阶级一样，没有力量也不可能抵御美货泛滥的洪流，许多工厂靠着卖厂房、卖家具，甚至卖工作母机过日子。如“上海机器厂”在日本投降前，有两百多个工人，但到解放以前，只剩了七、八个工人看厂子。解放两年多以来，人民政府为了扶助民族工业，给予这些工厂的贷款达二百八十六亿多元，给予他们的加工定货价值近三千亿元。仅
    “上海机器厂”得到的贷款就在二十亿元以上。这些工厂的老板看见自己的“事业”获得恢复并发展了，立刻露出了狰狞的面目。他们向人民政府一方面喊着“万岁”，另一方面却千方百计地向人民政府进攻。正像上海机器厂的董事、经理陈又新、毛毅可所说的：“我要多少价钱，你就得给我多少，否则，我就不作。”这个工厂的暴利，比成本高过百分之百到百分之二百还多。这些工厂的老板们，为了更有计划地向人民民主政权进攻，因而组织了“星四聚餐会”。
    “星四聚餐会”，最初是由重庆私营钢铁机器业中的六家大工厂的负责人发起，又吸收了六家中型工厂组成的。这个组织成立之初，只有国营某工厂和成渝铁路在私营工厂定货并委托加工。当时，“星四聚餐会”以这个国营工厂为进攻对象，企图从垄断加工定货中牟取非法暴利。为了这个可耻的目的，它和这个国营工厂基本建设处生产科长周绍文、外包工程师陈松柏等勾结在一起，把监督和指导加工定货工作的重庆市工商局副局长孙济世拉到“聚餐会”里，又把西南工业部经理处某科长钱绍武也拉过去，作为他们套取和垄断工业原料的内线。这一切布置就绪以后，“星四聚餐会”就张开血腥的嘴，向人民民主政权展开了大规模的进攻。这个国营工厂的外包工程，在周绍文操纵下，从来不用招标方式发包，而是交“星四聚餐会”去“统一分配”。工商局副局长孙济世还在“星四聚餐会”第三次会议上保证：今后不采取开标比价方式，而采用周绍文所“创造”的“统一分配”办法。所谓“统一分配”，实质上是把国家的委托加工和定货，交给这一伙不法资本家去分配。“星四聚餐会”的强盗们得到统一分配国家加工定货的特权以后，便统一抬高工价，统一抬高材料消耗费用，统一偷工减料，统一拖延完工日期。在这一连串的“统一”下，国家财产遭受了不可计算的损失，严重地影响了经济建设的进展。只就 “星四聚餐会”部分人员坦白的材料计算，他们单从这一个国营工厂就盗去国家资财二百亿元以上。
    随着国家经济的恢复和发展，“星四聚餐会”的组织也日益扩大。成渝铁路动工不久，“星四聚餐会”便指派它的“干将”吴宗楷组织“星五聚餐会”。吴宗楷是荣华机器厂经理，素以“铁作业大把头”著称。他笼络了洪发利、川昌、公鑫、荣新、张端生、志华、恒大、协成等九个工厂，收买了西南铁路局机务处副处长，组成了包围铁路局、垄断铁路器材加工定货的垄断组织。一年多来，他们通过这个组织所盗窃的国家财产究竟有多少，至今还计算不清。只知道在制做三十一付道岔的工程中，单以抬高工价、多报用料两项来说，就使国家直接损失七亿四千多万元。
    船舶是西南区的主要交通工具。修船造船的工程相当巨大。在天兴机器厂经理石漱流主谋下，曾有十四家工厂的负责人为承做修船造船工程，组成
    “星六聚餐会”（其中有些厂并不专门从事修船造船业务）。一九五一年冬，“星四聚餐会”的首脑分子高功懋又亲自出马，把“星六聚餐会”的川昌、天兴、协兴、合众、公鑫、鸿昌等六家，加上民生、川江、建新、新泰、源记、惠兴等六家，组成“造船小组”，专门垄断国家的修船造船工程。这个“造船小组”曾经骗得长江航务局重庆分局的“批准”，而且还吸收了国营川江船舶厂参加，并收买了航务局检查科长孙祺。因此它的活动更加明目张胆，肆无忌惮。这个“造船小组”曾以“十二条意见”上书航务局，要航务局制订“营业许可证”，交由“造船小组”来讨论和分配国家的修造船舶的工程。它要航务局规定：凡轮船公司和握有水上交通工具的国家企业机关，修造船时不得分散在一家以上的工厂施工。它要轮船公司和握有水上交通工具的国家企业机关，必须按时交来修造工程，以便他们“有计划地生产”。它不仅要现在握有水上交通工具的国家机关迅速开列详细修船表，而且要国家把“拟定中的造船计划”向他们填表报告，“否则各会员厂拒绝修造”。对于这个“意见”，长江航务局重庆分局如何处理还不得而知，但我们可以从这里看到资产阶级的进攻已经达到如何疯狂的地步！他们不光要把中小同业一下子挤垮，而且要把人民的国家机关变成他们牟取垄断暴利的工具！
    一九五零年冬，中央人民政府决定在全国各大城市制造纺织机的消息传到重庆。“星四聚餐会”的首脑分子余桂铨、顺昌厂经理和新民机器厂经理印仁基，立即召集协昌、合众、惠工、大来、大川、上海、合作、中国等十一家工厂的负责人开紧急会议。会议由余桂铨做主席。他说要揽到政府的纺织机工程，必先“巩固组织，加强团结”。到会各厂负责人一致表示“坚决拥护组织，坚决争取制造纺织机”。他们随即成立了“十一厂联络处”，由合作五金厂经理李汉湖任总干事，办理一般联络事宜；由印仁基等五人主持“对内”；由余桂铨、邵仁里和毛毅可为“飞京接洽承制纺织机的全权代表”。他们并决议在争取到纺织机工程以后，再在华东区所制订的纺织机底价上，要中央“特加照顾”。他们决定具体的照顾数目为：材料费比华东增加百分之三十；人工费在华东底价上加百分之二十；样板和特种工具津贴费加百分之十。他们经常的联络地点是民国路一六八号。从“十一厂联络处”成立到工程掌握在手，他们先后开过三十六次会议。他们派人在北京讨论的各种机件单价，要拿到这里研究；各种合同要经这里批准；工程任务由他们统一分配；所用原料由他们统一购买，甚至偷工减料的具体数字，也由他们统一安排。余桂铨等由北京返回重庆后，专门召开了“总结经验、布置任务”的会议。余桂铨在会上提出某种工程“在北京用工八万个，我们争取用六万个甚至四万个工交货”。在这个会议上，余桂铨还特别检讨了到北京谈判工作中的缺点是所谓“事前准备不够”，“和工业部联系差”。会议因此决定：“今后要靠拢工业部”，以便“向北京发展”。印仁基还提醒大家：“要做到组织上的一切保密”。在“向工业部靠拢”的方针下，他们要求西南工业部成立了“西南区公私营机器厂承造纺织机技术委员会”。他们特把西南军政委员会工业部某副部长抬出来做主任委员，他们自己担任副主任委员。但实际工作是掌握在他们手里。这个委员会只是把非法的“十一厂联络处”换了个公开名义罢了。
    以上四个组织，都是针对国家经济建设部门的工业加工和工业定货而组成的。一九五一年底，“星四聚餐会”又把震旦、中国、新民、大川、大来、顺昌、恒顺、大昌八家工厂的会计师联络起来，组成“会计师座谈会”。在“统一建账”的掩护下，这个“座谈会”专做偷漏国税和进攻国家税务人员的试验，准备以后在“星四聚餐会”的各会员厂都照样实行。这个组织成立不久，全国人民反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争就开始了。
    “星四聚餐会”已经成了资产阶级向国家进攻的核心，已经由最初时期的十二个厂发展到四五十个厂（其中一半是外围，一半是核心），由一个组织发展到五个组织，由混合组织逐渐发展为几个专业的组织。“星四聚餐会”的组织极其严密，参加这个组织的人要经过个别介绍，大会通过，再经过一定时期的“列席”，方能成为正式“会员”。它组织了各种不同的外围，目的是培养会员厂，在条件成熟时争取合法。
    从“星四聚餐会”的发展过程和现状来看，它已经不是单纯的盗窃国家资财的经济组织，而且是具有政治阴谋的野心集团了。它把钢铁机器业同业公会变成了它的傀儡，它有权“圈定”重庆市各界人民代表会议的工商业界代表。加上被它收买的内奸和派进国家机关的“坐探”，若干政府部门已经变成了它攫取暴利的工具。如果今天还有人硬说资产阶级没有进攻的组织，不可能有什么猖狂进攻，那就请他们看看“星四聚餐会”的罪行吧！
