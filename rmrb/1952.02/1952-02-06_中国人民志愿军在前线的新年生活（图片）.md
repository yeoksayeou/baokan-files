The Chinese People's Volunteers on the front lines are confidently welcoming the victorious year of 1952. To live up to the囑咐 (zhǔfù- exhortations) of the people of the motherland and the earnest expectations of peace-loving people all over the world, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers are intensifying their training in the New Year to prevent the American aggressors from continuing their conspiracies to delay, obstruct, and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations through planned threats and provocative actions.

    On the New Year's wall newspapers, the heroes of the Volunteers expressed their determination to kill the enemy and perform meritorious services.

    To express their gratitude and love for the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people prepared慰劳品 (wèiláo pǐn - comfort items) during the New Year and extended their regards to the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    To celebrate the great victory of 1951 and welcome the victorious New Year, the heroic Volunteers happily beat gongs and drums on the positions, performing various kinds of music.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers on the front lines received a large number of New Year慰劳品 (wèiláo pǐn - comfort items) such as chickens, ducks, and canned goods shipped from the motherland, and they deeply expressed their gratitude for the concern of the people of the motherland.

    During the New Year, the heroes of the Volunteers and the Korean People's Army held a get-together on the positions with Korean primary school students.

    In the New Year of last year, the heroic Volunteers lived a hard life of eating roasted flour and snow, but in this New Year, our heroes can eat dumplings and pork.
