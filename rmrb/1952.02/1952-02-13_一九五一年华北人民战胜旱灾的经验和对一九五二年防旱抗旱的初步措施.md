Report to Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government

Premier Zhou:

I hereby report the experience of the North China people in overcoming the drought in 1951 and preliminary measures for drought prevention and resistance in 1952 as follows:

There is very little water area in North China, accounting for only a little over 11% of the 260 million mu of cultivated land. In addition, rainfall is insufficient and mostly concentrated in July and August, resulting in "droughts nine years out of ten," with severe droughts when there is no rain and minor droughts when there is little rain. Even if rainfall is normal, most areas are prone to spring droughts. Over the years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of North China have carried out large-scale mass drought prevention and resistance struggles and have achieved great results. For example, last spring, the entire North China region suffered from severe drought, and 70% of the cotton fields were planted using drought-resistant methods such as carrying water for planting and seizing moisture for planting; a widespread movement to open canals and dig wells was also launched. Last year, a total of more than 52,000 brick wells were dug (there are currently more than 730,000 wells in the entire region), 67,000 waterwheels were promoted (there are currently about 350,000 waterwheels in the entire region), and more than 4,000 large and small canals were repaired, expanding the irrigated area by more than 5 million mu. Therefore, even though the spring drought was severe, it was still possible to largely overcome the drought and partially mitigate its effects. Last year, except for the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, which suffered significant crop reductions due to the severity of the disaster, the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan all achieved an average of 70% of a normal harvest.

The main experiences of North China's drought prevention and resistance struggles over the years are:

1.  It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, overcome the passive mentality of relying on heaven for rain, and promote the revolutionary spirit of man conquering nature. This requires constantly educating the masses, raising awareness of drought, preparing for drought prevention every year, conscientiously implementing production self-reliance, and incorporating drought prevention and resistance into patriotic production increase pacts. This is a crucial key to overcoming drought.

2.  It is necessary to plan and prepare for drought prevention and resistance work early. To this end, we convened a regional drought prevention conference at the end of last October to summarize the masses' drought prevention experience, study the drought prevention work for 1952, and carry out the following tasks:

    (1) It is necessary to plow once before the ground freezes, requiring that plowing does not stop while the ground is not frozen. According to recent reports from various provinces, autumn plowing has reached 80% to 95% of the land that should be plowed. This plays a significant role in weeding, pest control, snow accumulation, moisture retention, loosening the soil, and resting the land.

    (2) It is necessary to make full use of existing canals and wells and universally implement autumn storage and winter irrigation. This is of great significance for increasing wheat production this year, ensuring spring planting, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests; on the other hand, it can also take advantage of the larger water volume in autumn compared to spring to distribute water seasonally and expand the irrigated area.

    (3) Dry land should universally create wind-sheltered ridges to accumulate snow, and areas along rivers and lakes should store water and cultivate ice. That is, when the upper layer of river water freezes solid, holes are drilled in the ice, and the downward flow of water is blocked with firewood and grass, causing the water to rise onto the ice, gradually thickening the ice layer, which is then used for irrigation after thawing.

    (4) There are nearly 400,000 large and small reservoirs in North China, capable of storing more than 1 million cubic meters of water, which is of great benefit for drought prevention, flood control, sand interception, and silt fertilization. The masses should be mobilized to select suitable locations and systematically increase and expand reservoirs.

3.  Expand paddy fields, use water rationally, and fully utilize hydropower.

    (1) Strengthen the management of existing canals and wells, use water rationally, and expand the benefited area. Wells that are well managed through mutual aid and cooperation can irrigate 20 to 50 mu each, and some can even guarantee the spring planting of more than 100 mu of cultivated land; wells that are poorly managed individually can only irrigate more than 10 mu of land. This shows that managing existing canals and wells well can increase the irrigated area by a quarter to a third. To this end, it is necessary to seriously correct the one-sided thinking of emphasizing engineering and neglecting management, establish and improve water conservancy management agencies at all levels, strengthen political leadership and technical guidance, organize mutual aid and cooperation, implement democratic management, completely abolish feudal water regulations, and establish a rational water use system from top to bottom, from high to low, and sequential rotation irrigation, so as to give full play to the potential irrigation capacity of canals and wells.

    (2) Actively develop water sources: First, universally develop well irrigation, which is a feasible and effective drought resistance method in most areas. About 70% of the North China plains can be used for well digging, with the water level generally around 25 feet. The masses should be widely mobilized to help each other dig wells to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and capital and scattered land. Brick kilns should be developed to dig more brick wells. Stone, lime, and knotgrass can also be used to replace bricks for well construction, which is of great significance for drought prevention and production increase. While developing wells, it is necessary to solve the problem of water lifting tools, which can be solved from the following two aspects: First, local industries and handicrafts should be organized to produce waterwheels in a planned way, and the government should help solve the difficulties of raw materials (pig iron, lead plates, copper, etc.) and funds, and should actively organize the masses to borrow waterwheels in groups; second, improve and manufacture the original simple water lifting tools, such as windlasses, cranes, and water buckets, to supplement the lack of waterwheels. Second, use rivers to open canals to divert water. Major canals should not be built rashly; however, for small rivers, the masses should be mobilized to build small canals, and cooperatives should organize this matter; river wells should also be dug, small springs should be excavated, and machinery irrigation should be used with emphasis.

4.  Improve farming techniques. After autumn, universal plowing and deep plowing should be carried out, and before spring, more harrowing and fine harrowing should be carried out, and more hoeing should be carried out after emergence to maintain moisture. In areas that are too dry, drought-resistant crops with deep roots should be planted, such as wheat, sesame, millet, and potatoes. This requires preparing drought-resistant crop seeds early.

5.  It is necessary to seize the spring plowing season, start early, and check the soil moisture. If spring drought is found, a mass drought-resistant planting movement should be launched as early and quickly as possible, which is an effective way to strive to complete spring plowing and planting on time in the absence of rain or insufficient rain.

At present, the Beginning of Spring has passed, and spring plowing is about to begin, but there is still a severe lack of rain and snow. This drought situation will inevitably affect spring plowing and planting and may lead to a major drought. We have informed all localities that they must carry out key disaster relief, universal drought prevention, and immediately begin (such as in Pingyuan Province) and actively prepare for spring plowing. Anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy work at the district and village levels shall be carried out after spring plowing. People's governments at and above the county level should have leading comrades in charge of relevant departments to fully guide and inspect the above work, and must not be negligent in the slightest. If attention is not paid to the seasonality of agricultural production, the interests of the people will be seriously violated, which must be paid close attention to by all localities. The above report is for the Premier's reference and request for instructions.

    一九五一年华北人民战胜旱灾的经验和对一九五二年防旱抗旱的初步措施
    ——中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会主任  刘澜涛
    向政务院周恩来总理的报告
    周总理：
    兹将一九五一年华北人民战胜旱灾的经验和对一九五二年防旱抗旱的初步措施，报告如下：
    华北水地很少，仅占二亿六千余万亩耕地的百分之十一强。又加雨量不足，且多集中在七、八两月降落，因而“十年九旱”，无雨大旱，少雨小旱。即使雨量正常，大部地区亦易遭春旱。历年来，华北人民在党与人民政府领导下，开展了大规模的群众性的防旱、抗旱斗争，并取得了巨大成绩。如去年春天华北全区苦旱，百分之七十的棉田，是用担水点种和借墒抢种等抗旱办法种上的；并普遍开展了开渠、打井运动。去年一年共打砖井五万二千余眼（全区现有水井七十三万多眼），推广水车六万七千辆（全区现共有水车约三十五万辆），修整大小渠道四千余条，共扩大了水浇地五百余万亩，因而，即使春旱严重，仍能作到大部战胜旱灾，局部减轻旱灾。去年除察哈尔、绥远两省因灾情过于严重而收成大减外，河北、山西、平原三省均争取到平均七成年景。
    华北历年防旱抗旱斗争的主要经验是：
    一、必须充分发动群众，克服靠天等雨的消极思想，发扬人定胜天的革命精神。这就必须经常地教育群众，提高对旱灾的警惕性，年年准备防旱，认真贯彻生产自救，并把防旱、抗旱订入爱国丰产公约。这是战胜旱灾的重要关键。
    二、必须有计划地及早作好防旱、抗旱准备工作。为此，我们曾于去年十月末召开了一次全区性的防旱会议，总结了群众的防旱经验，研究了一九五二年的防旱工作，并进行了以下工作：
    （1）必须在地冻前普耕一遍，要求地不冻，犁不停。据最近各省报告，去年秋耕已达应耕地的百分之八十至百分之九十五。这对除草、杀虫、积雪、养墒、疏松土壤、休息地力均起很大作用。
    （2）要充分利用现有水渠水井，普遍实行秋汇冬浇。这对今年小麦增产、保证春耕播种和防除病虫害亦有很大作用；另一方面，还能趁秋季比春季水量大，分季使水，扩大浇地面积。
    （3）旱地要普遍背风起垅积雪，沿河沿湖地区要储水养冰。即在河水上层冻结坚固时，冰上打洞，用柴草堵塞下面水流去路，使水冒到冰上，冰层逐渐加厚，待解冻后用以浇地。
    （4）华北现有大小蓄水池近四十万个，能蓄水一百多万立方公尺，这对防旱、防洪、拦沙、淤肥均有极大好处。应发动群众，选择适宜地点，有计划地增加与扩大蓄水池。
    三、扩大水田，合理用水，充分发挥水力。
    （1）加强现有渠道水井管理，合理用水，扩大受益面积。互助合作管理好的水井，每眼能浇二十到五十亩，甚至有的能保证百余亩耕地的春耕播种；单干管理不好的，一眼井只能浇十余亩地。这说明把现有渠道水井管理好，即可增浇耕地四分之一到三分之一。为此，必须认真纠正重视工程、忽视管理的片面思想，必须建立与健全各级水利管理机构，加强政治领导与技术指导，并组织互助合作，实行民主管理，彻底废除封建水规，建立自上而下、由高而低、顺水轮浇的合理用水制度，发挥水渠水井灌溉的潜在能力。
    （2）积极开发水源：第一是普遍发展水井灌溉，这是大部地区可行的有效的抗旱办法。华北平川约有百分之七十地区可以打井，水位一般在二丈五尺左右，应广泛发动群众互助打井，以克服劳力资力不足和土地分散的困难。要发展砖窑业，多打砖井。还可用石头、石灰、知节草等代砖造井，对防旱增产有极大作用。与发展水井同时，必须解决汲水工具，可从下列两方面解决：一是组织地方工业和手工业有计划生产水车，政府应帮助解决原料（生铁、铅板、铜等）资金等困难，并应积极组织群众伙贷水车；二是改良和制造原有简单的汲水工具，如辘轳、吊杆、水斗等，以补水车之不足。第二是利用河流开渠引水。对较大渠道，不宜轻率兴修；但对小河流，则应发动群众兴办小型渠道，合作社应组织此事；并可多打通河井，开凿小泉，并有重点地使用机器灌溉。
    四、改进耕作技术。秋后要普耕深耕，春前要多耙细耙，出苗后要多锄，以保持水分。过于干旱的地方要多种深根耐旱的作物，如小麦、芝麻、谷子、马铃薯等。这就必须提早准备好富于抗旱性的作物种籽。
    五、要抓紧春耕季节，及早动手，查验墒土。如发现春旱，就要及早迅速地开展群众性的抗旱播种运动，这是无雨、缺雨情况下争取按时完成春耕播种的有效办法。
    目前立春已过，春耕即将开始，但至今雨雪极缺，这种干旱情况，势将影响春耕播种，并可能酿成大旱。我们已告各地必须进行重点救灾，普遍防旱，立即开始（如平原省）和积极准备春耕。区、村两级反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义工作一律在春耕后进行，县以上各级人民政府应有主要负责同志领导有关部门，全力指导和检查上述工作，不得稍有疏忽。如果不注意农业生产上的季节性，就一定要严重违反人民利益，这是必须引起各地严加注意的。以上报告，供总理参考，并请指示。
