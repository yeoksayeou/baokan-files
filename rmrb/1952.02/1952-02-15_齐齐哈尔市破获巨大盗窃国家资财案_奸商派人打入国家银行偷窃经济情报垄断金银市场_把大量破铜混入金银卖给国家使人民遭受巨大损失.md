    Qiqihar City Uncovers Huge Case of Stealing National Property
    Treacherous Merchants Send People into the State Bank to Steal Economic Intelligence and Monopolize the Gold and Silver Market
    Mix Large Amounts of Scrap Copper into Gold and Silver Sold to the State, Causing Huge Losses to the People
    The case of Wu Yizhi and others, gold and silver dealers in Qiqihar City, who conspired to send inside agents to the State Bank to systematically steal and defraud a large amount of state property, has been completely solved, and all the principal and accessory offenders have been arrested.
    In 1946, Wu Yizhi took advantage of the State Bank's recruitment of staff and sent his son, Wu Chengzhang, to work at the Nenjiang Provincial Branch of the Northeast Bank at that time. In 1947, after Wu Chengzhang was transferred to work in receiving and inspecting gold and silver, Wu Yizhi colluded with treacherous merchants Tian Zhisheng, Han Yunchen, and others in Qiqihar City, and worked with the inside agent Wu Chengzhang to start criminal activities of stealing and defrauding a large amount of state property. At that time, peasants in various counties were selling in large quantities the fruits of struggle from the land reform—gold and silver—and the State Bank was purchasing them in large quantities at posted prices. Wu Yizhi, Tian Zhisheng, Han Yunchen, and others then bought large amounts of gold and silver on the market, and then mixed one-third each of brass, red copper, and silver to make fake silver cakes and silver bars, pretending to be silver; they mixed silver or brass into gold to make inferior gold bars, washed them with potion, and pretended to be pure gold to sell to the state. Wu Chengzhang accepted the thousands of taels of fake silver and inferior gold sent by the offenders at the state-set price. Seeing that Wu and others were making huge profits, gold and silver merchants throughout Qiqihar rushed to participate in this fraudulent activity. Every family in the gold and silver industry rushed to buy scrap copper, and every household forged fake silver. The atmosphere of theft spread throughout the city and became an "open secret" in the business community. At that time, gold and silver dealers even used carts to haul scrap copper to their homes and sent bags of fake gold and silver to the Northeast Bank. Some treacherous merchants sold fake gold and silver to Wu and Han at low prices, and then sold them to the State Bank through them to share the profits. Some bolder treacherous merchants, such as Wu Qihua, even took fake silver and forced Wu Chengzhang to buy it. Wu Chengzhang believed that he would not profit from it and refused to buy it, citing poor quality. Wu Qihua shouted, "You accept what your father sells but not mine, I'm going to report you!" Wu Chengzhang was forced to accept it all. In this way, the offender Wu sold more than 2,000 taels of fake silver to the state in one transaction. Other colleagues also imitated this despicable method to sell fake silver. The treacherous merchants became even more rampant after not being discovered for the first few times they stole and defrauded gold and silver. Taking advantage of the bank's refusal to accept fragmented gold and silver, they ordered their inside agent, Wu Chengzhang, to deliberately refuse to accept gold and silver directly sold to the bank by peasants, forcing the peasants to sell good gold and silver to them at low prices. In addition, they further stole state economic intelligence through Wu Chengzhang, learned in advance about changes in the State Bank's prices, and then bought and sold gold and silver in large quantities throughout the city, monopolizing the gold and silver market in Qiqihar City. The city's gold and silver industry made ill-gotten gains through such criminal activities.
    After Qiqihar City vigorously launched the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, this collective case of stealing state property was solved at the end of January through mass reporting, inspection by the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, and investigation by public security personnel. All dozens of principal and accessory offenders have been arrested. After preliminary trial, the offenders have initially confessed that they sold more than 90,000 taels of silver and 50,000 wa of gold to the state from 1947 to 1950, including 40,000 taels of scrap copper sold as silver. At least 5% of the gold sold contained scrap copper or silver. In addition, tax evasion in transactions exceeded 100 million yuan (now under further investigation). The huge losses caused to the state and the people by the offenders' trafficking in gold and silver, disrupting finance, and driving up prices are still impossible to calculate.

    齐齐哈尔市破获巨大盗窃国家资财案
    奸商派人打入国家银行偷窃经济情报垄断金银市场
    把大量破铜混入金银卖给国家使人民遭受巨大损失
    齐齐哈尔市金银贩子武益芝等，合谋派遣内奸，打入国家银行，有计划地盗骗大量国家资财案，已被完全破获，主从各犯都已落网。
    一九四六年，武益芝借国家银行招考工作人员的机会，派遣他儿子武成章混入当时的东北银行嫩江省分行工作。一九四七年武成章调作收验金银工作后，武益芝就和齐齐哈尔市奸商田志升、韩云宸等相勾结，和内奸武成章里应外合，开始了大量盗骗国家财产的罪恶活动。当时，各县农民正大批出卖土地改革中的斗争果实——黄金、白银，国家银行挂牌大批收购。武益芝、田志升、韩云宸等就在市场上大量收买金银，然后把黄铜、红铜、白银各三分之一兑在一起，化成假银饼、银条，冒充白银；在黄金中掺入白银或黄铜，作成次等金条，用药水洗过，冒充足金，卖给国家。武成章把各犯送去的上千两假白银和次等黄金，都按国家牌价收下。齐齐哈尔全市金银商见武等获得暴利，闻风而至，共同参加这一盗骗活动。金银业家家抢购破铜，户户伪造假白银，盗窃之风传遍全市，在工商界中已成为“公开秘密”。当时金银贩子们甚至用车往家里拉破铜，整袋往东北银行送假金银。有一部分奸商就把假金银低价卖给武、韩各犯，然后通过他们卖给国家银行，共同分肥。更有一些胆大的奸商，如武起华，竟拿着假白银强令武成章收买。武犯成章认为自己无利可图，即以成色不好为理由拒绝收买。武起华竟大叫：“收你爸爸卖的不收我的，我去告你！”武成章被迫就全部收下。这样，武犯一次就卖给国家假白银二千多两。其他同业也仿效这一卑鄙办法出卖假白银。奸商们最初几次盗骗金银未被发觉，就更加猖狂起来。他们乘银行不收零碎金银的机会，命令他们的内奸武成章，故意不收农民直接卖往银行的金银，逼迫农民不得不把好金银低价卖给他们。此外，还进一步通过武成章偷盗国家经济情报，预先探知国家银行牌价变动情况，然后在全市大量吞吐金银，垄断了齐齐哈尔市的金银市场。全市的金银业用这样的罪恶活动，发了横财。
    齐齐哈尔市大张旗鼓地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，经群众检举、市节约检查委员会的检查和公安局人员的侦察，这一集体盗骗国家资财案已于一月底破获。所有主从各犯数十人全部落网。经过初审，各犯已初步供出自一九四七年至一九五○年间共卖给国家白银九万多两，黄金五万瓦，其中把破铜当做白银出卖的达四万两，以上所卖的黄金至少有百分之五掺有破铜或白银。此外，交易中偷漏国税也在一亿元以上（现在继续侦讯中）。由于各犯捣卖金银、扰乱金融，哄抬物价给国家及人民所造成的巨大损失尚无法计算。
