    Hengshui Transportation Company Joint Transport Division
    Should Swiftly Investigate and Rectify Bureaucratic Work Styles That Disregard Worker Safety
    Feng, the section chief, and Liu, the business clerk, of the Joint Transport Division of Hengshui Transportation Company in Hebei Province, do not care about the safety of workers. The Joint Transport Division has never been equipped with ramps and lights for loading and unloading trains. Union cadres and workers have repeatedly suggested this to the company, but to no avail. On one occasion, Liu, the business clerk, even said, "It doesn't matter if a few die from falling." As a result, a porter, Zhang Baolin, carrying a sack of more than 100 catties, lost his footing and fell from a seven-foot-high ramp because it was too dark to see the ramp clearly. The back of his head hit the ground, creating a large bloody hole, and he bled profusely and fainted. When the porters reported this situation to the Joint Transport Division, the Joint Transport Division not only didn't care but also said, "If they don't break their brains, they have to keep loading." I believe that the bureaucratic behavior of the Joint Transport Division in disregarding worker safety is intolerable, and the leading cadres of this unit should promptly investigate and deal with this matter.

    衡水运输公司联运股
    应迅速检查纠正漠视工人安全的官僚主义作风
    河北省衡水运输公司联运股冯股长、刘业务员不关心工人安全。联运股从来没有设备过装卸火车用的跳板和灯。工会干部和工人曾数次到公司去建议，也没有效果。有一次，刘业务员反而说：“摔死几个没有关系。”结果，搬运工人张保林因为天太黑，看不清跳板，扛着一百多斤重的麻袋，从七尺高的跳板上一脚蹬空摔下来，后脑摔了一个大血窟窿，流血不止，晕倒在地。搬运工人把这一情况向联运股报告时，联运股不但不管，还说“摔不出脑子来就得给装”。我认为联运股这种漠视工人安全的官僚主义行为是不能容忍的，这个单位的领导干部，应迅速检查处理这件事。  杨正秋
