    Profiteer Li Yinting Directly Harms the People

    Editor: Our dearest Volunteer Army comrades are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves heroically on the front lines. Some comrades have died, while others have become disabled. They do this for our happiness and safety, and for the beautiful future of our motherland. Every Chinese person is moved and encouraged by their great and sincere love for the motherland and the people.

    However, profiteers like Li Yinting, who have lost all conscience, are viciously attacking the Volunteer Army from the rear. Li Yinting is harming the Volunteer Army, undermining the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and directly helping the imperialists. We and these profiteers cannot coexist under the same sky. We cannot tolerate these traitors of the people and degenerates of the nation continuing to exist on our beautiful and pure land of the motherland. For the benefit of all the people, for the victory of Resist America, Aid Korea, and for world peace, we demand that the People's Government give Li Yinting the most severe punishment.

    奸商李寅廷直接危害人民
    编辑同志：我们最亲爱的志愿军同志们在前方流血牺牲，英勇作战，有些同志牺牲了，有些同志则变成了残废。他们这样做，都是为了我们的幸福和安全，为了祖国美满的将来。每个中国人民都被他们这种伟大真挚的对祖国、对人民的热爱感动着、鼓舞着。
    但是李寅廷这些丧尽天良的奸商，在后方却对志愿军下了凶狠的毒手。李寅廷陷害了志愿军，破坏着抗美援朝运动，直接帮助了帝国主义。我们和这些奸商不共戴天，我们不能容忍这些人民的叛徒、民族的败类再在我们美丽的、纯洁的祖国土地上继续存在。为了全体人民的利益，为了抗美援朝的胜利，为了世界和平，我们要求人民政府予李寅廷以最严厉的惩罚。
    中国兵工工会全国委员会全体工作人员
