    (Nineteen) Liu Zhengming had only walked a few steps when he ran into his younger sister carrying her schoolbag and a classmate. His sister said, "Mom is making dumplings on Saturday night, are you coming home?" Liu Zhengming absentmindedly grunted in response; but in his heart he thought: A few years ago, my sister was still a child picking up coal cinders, and today she can go to school. Isn't this all thanks to Chairman Mao?
    (Twenty) After walking a few more steps, Liu Zhengming looked up and saw a propaganda poster for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. He thought that the volunteers were fighting so hard on the front lines to protect our good life; but Xu Rende was evading taxes, bribing officials, and undermining our national construction.
    (Twenty-one) The more Liu Zhengming thought about it, the more he felt he should expose Xu Rende. He threw the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" he was holding forcefully on the ground, wishing he could immediately report it to the trade union – but then he thought that he needed to find Accountant Zhou to uncover all of Xu Rende's secrets.

    （十九）刘正明刚走几步，正碰见他妹妹提着书包和一个同学迎面走来。他妹妹说：“妈在星期六晚上包饺子吃，你回家呀？”刘正明心不在焉地唔了一声；心里却想：几年前妹妹还是一个拾煤核的孩子，今天能上学了，还不是毛主席带给我们的好处。
    （二十）走不几步，刘正明一抬头，看见抗美援朝的宣传画。他想志愿军在前方那样艰苦作战，为的是保卫我们的好日子；可是徐仁德却偷税、行贿，破坏我们的国家建设。
    （二十一）刘正明越想越该检举徐仁德。他把手里的三国演义使劲往地上一摔，恨不得立刻就去工会报告——但他想到要找会计周先生才能摸到徐仁德的全部老底。
