    We Must Demand Blood Debt Repayment from the American Robbers
    Liu Yingyuan, National Model Worker, Director of Shijingshan Power Plant
    The bloodthirsty American robbers have destroyed countless peaceful cities and villages in Korea with artillery shells and bombs, and killed countless women and children. Not satisfied, they have also collected a handful of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals from the graveyard of Japanese fascists and spread a large number of bacterial insects towards the peaceful and kind Korean people and the Chinese and Korean forces fighting for justice. We firmly protest against this inhuman and beastly behavior, and we must demand blood debt repayment from the American robbers.
    The Chinese people have long recognized that American imperialism is a vicious jackal. This inhuman crime of the American robbers has further enabled the people of the world to recognize the hideous faces of the American robbers, and to further recognize: who is seeking peace and defending peace; who is against the vast majority of mankind, delaying the Korean negotiations, and plotting to expand the war of aggression. This crime of spreading bacteria by the American robbers is bound to arouse strong anger and opposition from all kind people in the world, and make the people of the world more clearly recognize that the American robbers are the common enemy of all mankind.
    This evil act of the American robbers does not show their strength, but rather shows their dead end and desperate struggle. The American robbers are panicked in the face of the increasingly powerful Chinese and Korean People's Forces, and panicked in the face of the vigorously developing world peace movement. Their invading troops in Korea have been defeated by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, and their aggressive activities in Western European countries have also been frustrated everywhere. The American robbers are determined not to turn back, so they have come up with even more vicious tricks.
    In the minds of the American warmongers, they are either planning to use "bacterial warfare" to frighten the Chinese and Korean people, in order to obtain what they cannot obtain on the Korean battlefield. We want to seriously warn the American warmongers: do not mistakenly think that the sincerity of the Chinese and Korean people in seeking peace is a sign of weakness and vulnerability. The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. Our Chinese people have been tempered and strengthened in the flames of war. We have defeated the heinous and rampant Japanese imperialism; we have eliminated the eight million troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was actively supported by American imperialism; when the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people - the Chinese People's Volunteers - appeared on the Korean battlefield, they quickly reversed the Korean war situation together with the Korean People's Army. At that time, we used rifles and hand grenades to defeat the mechanized troops of the United States and its accomplice countries. Now that we have powerful artillery and an increasingly powerful air force, can't we inflict even more severe blows on the American invaders? Japanese imperialism once temporarily occupied many provinces of our country, and once used the "three alls" policy of kill all, burn all, and loot all, in an attempt to strangle the Chinese people's anti-Japanese armed forces. They inhumanely spread plague-infected fleas and other infectious bacteria in many areas of China. But all this did not save Japanese imperialism from its fate of death. If the American invaders are obsessed with their mistakes, they will only accelerate their own path to the dead end that Japanese imperialism once took.
    Dear Volunteer Comrades, I believe that you will turn anger into strength and continue to give the American robbers even heavier blows. The people of the motherland will more actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and will more actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy to fully support you. We must demand blood debt repayment from the American robbers who collude with Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals!

    我们一定要向美国强盗索回血债
    全国劳动模范  石景山发电厂厂长  刘英源
    嗜杀成性的美国强盗用炮弹和炸弹毁灭了朝鲜的无数和平城市和乡村，炸死无数的妇女和儿童，还不满足，他们又从日本法西斯坟墓里收拣起一小撮日本细菌战犯，向着和平善良的朝鲜人民和为正义而战的中朝部队撒下大批细菌毒虫。我们坚决抗议这种灭绝人性的野兽行为，我们一定要向美国强盗讨还血债。
    中国人民早已认清美帝国主义是一只凶残的豺狼。美国强盗的这一灭绝人性的罪恶行动，更使全世界人民进一步认清美国强盗的狰狞面目，进一步认清：是谁在谋取和平，捍卫和平；谁在与广大人类为敌，拖延朝鲜谈判、阴谋扩大侵略战争。美国强盗这种撒放细菌的罪行，势必引起世界上一切善良的人们的强烈愤怒和反对，使全世界人民更加认清美国强盗是全人类的公敌。
    美国强盗的这一罪恶行动不是表现了它的力量强大，这正表现了它的穷途末路，垂死挣扎。美国强盗在日益强大的中朝人民部队面前恐慌了，在蓬蓬勃勃日益壮大的世界和平运动面前恐慌了，它们在朝鲜的侵略军队被中朝人民部队打败了，在西欧各国的侵略活动又是到处碰壁。美国强盗是死不回头的，于是，它便拿出更狠毒的花招来。
    在美国战争贩子的脑壳里，或者是打算用“细菌战争”来吓倒中朝人民，以取得他们在朝鲜战场上所不能取得的东西。我们要严重警告美国的战争贩子们：不要把中朝人民谋取和平的诚意，错误地认为是软弱可欺。中国人民热爱和平，但毫不惧怕战争。我们中国人民是在战争的火焰里锻炼壮大起来的。我们曾打败了穷凶极恶、横行一时的日本帝国主义；我们曾消灭掉美帝国主义积极扶植的蒋介石匪帮的八百万军队；当中国人民的优秀子弟——中国人民志愿军出现在朝鲜战场的时候，和朝鲜人民军一道很快地扭转了朝鲜战局。那时我们用的还是步枪、手榴弹，就打败了美国及其帮凶国家的机械化部队。当我们已拥有强大的炮兵和日益强大的空军的时候，难道我们不能给美国侵略者以更严重的打击吗？日本帝国主义曾暂时侵占过我国的许多省份，曾经用杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光”政策，企图扼杀中国人民抗日武装，他们曾灭绝人性地在中国许多地区散播过染有鼠疫的跳蚤和其他传染病菌。但这一切并未能挽救日本帝国主义的死亡命运。如果美国侵略者执迷不悟，就只有加速他们自己走上日本帝国主义曾经走过的死路。
    亲爱的志愿军同志们，我相信你们会把愤怒变为力量，不断地给美国强盗以更加沉重的打击。祖国人民会更加积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，会更加积极地搞好增产节约运动，以全力支援你们。我们一定要向勾结日本细菌战犯的美国强盗索回血债！
