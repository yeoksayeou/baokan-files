    Pyongyang Celebrates the Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
    Message of Greetings to Chairman Mao Zedong

    To Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, who sincerely aids the Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War:

    Today, as the Korean people celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of their armed forces – the Korean People's Army – we extend the highest honor and gratitude to you, the great leader of the Chinese people, the entire Chinese people under your leadership, and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting heroically on our soil.

    The Korean People's Army, which is celebrating its fourth anniversary today, although a young army with a short history, has grown into a powerful armed force of the Korean people together with the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers sent by the great Chinese people under your leadership, in the just Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of the American and British aggressors and their lackeys. It is gloriously defending the independence and freedom of its fatherland by displaying a high degree of patriotic devotion and heroic spirit.

    The warm, fraternal assistance that you and the Chinese people under your leadership have given to the Korean people's just war, especially the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and their heroic struggle during our most difficult period, has become a huge and decisive force in defeating the armed aggressors of American imperialism, the common enemy of the people of Korea and China, greatly strengthening the Korean people's confidence in victory.

    The commanders and fighters of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, together with our People's Army, encountered many difficulties and hardships in the fierce battlefields during the war, but they established countless brilliant achievements in the battle against the enemy with their unparalleled heroism, perseverance, and high degree of internationalism.

    The historical friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, forged with precious blood through a long revolutionary struggle, has been further consolidated in the just liberation war against the armed aggressors of American imperialism, the common enemy of the peoples of Korea and China, becoming an invincible force.

    The Korean people will never forget the great support given to us by the great Chinese people under your leadership and the contributions made by the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on our soil. We firmly believe that our common struggle, which is receiving the warm support and solidarity of the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the great Soviet people, will end in final, glorious victory.

    For the further consolidation of the friendship between the people of Korea and China, and for the greater and more brilliant achievements of the great Chinese people in the future, and for the peace and security of the Far East, we wish you longevity without limit.

    光荣的中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员在战争过程中和我们人民军一起，在激烈的战场上虽然遭到了许多难关和困苦，但是以自己无比的英雄主义坚忍精神和高度的国际主义精神，在和敌人的战斗中建立了无数的辉煌功绩。
    通过长期的革命斗争以宝贵的鲜血结成的朝中两国人民的历史的友谊团结，在反对朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者的正义解放战争中更加巩固起来，成为不可战胜的力量了。
    朝鲜人民永远不会忘记您所领导的伟大的中国人民所给予我们的巨大的支援和中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员在我们的疆土上所建立的功勋。我们坚信，受着以伟大的苏联人民为首的全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持和声援的我们的共同斗争，一定会以最后的光辉胜利来结束。
