Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government
Instructions on the Spring Afforestation Work in 1952

I.

Afforestation is one of the fundamental ways to prevent drought and flood. All regions should vigorously carry out afforestation work in conjunction with the spirit of the State Council's decision on the anti-drought movement. Now that spring afforestation is about to begin, based on past experience, the most important goal for this spring's afforestation work, in addition to actively mobilizing the masses to complete the plan, should be to improve the survival rate of afforestation. To this end, the following items must be carried out in various regions:

(1) Conduct in-depth patriotic education on increasing production for the masses, clarify the policy of "whoever plants it owns it," and explain the benefits of "afforestation for ten years, no worries about food and clothing," so that the masses are "happy to plant" and "manage to plant and keep alive." Therefore, before afforestation, each county, district, and village, especially districts and villages, should strive to hold a mobilization meeting or work conference as universally as possible to exchange experiences and make specific arrangements.

(2) According to the principle of "people's planting with public assistance," actively promote cooperative afforestation. The internal interest relationship of cooperative organizations must be clearly and reasonably stipulated, and procedures such as signing contracts and issuing shares must be handled carefully to eliminate public concerns. As for whether to promote public-private cooperation or mass cooperation, it should be entirely based on the wishes of the masses in various places; public-private cooperation is not for profit-sharing, but to help the masses solve difficulties and increase confidence in cooperation.

(3) Start action quickly, cooperate with the central work, organize forces, clarify the division of labor, and do a good job in reviewing afforestation land and formulating implementation plans. Sufficient arrangements must be made for the organization of mass forces and the preparation of seeds and tools to ensure that various work links are connected to each other, so as to achieve "people not delaying seedlings" and "seedlings not delaying people." In terms of time, afforestation work should generally be completed before spring plowing.

(4) Strictly select seeds or seedlings used for afforestation. Tree seeds that are not suitable for direct seeding or have lost their germination power, as well as seedlings that have been seriously damaged by diseases or are dry, should be strictly prohibited from being used to avoid wasting manpower and materials.

(5) After the afforestation movement begins, conduct specific and in-depth technical guidance, while absorbing mass experience and using various methods to disseminate information in a timely manner. After afforestation, conduct inspections and organize the masses to conduct mutual inspections and evaluations, with rewards and criticisms. Afforestation achievements and experiences (especially new experiences) should be summarized and reported in a timely manner.

II.

In 1951, a total of 6.8 million mu of afforestation was completed nationwide, but the general survival rate was very low. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, the national average afforestation survival rate was only 65%, which means that at least 35% of the afforestation has been lost; to make up for this deficiency, the following two tasks must be carried out in various regions this spring:

(1) Conduct universal inspection and replanting to ensure that all planted young forests can become forests.

(2) Mobilize the masses, especially women, children, or students, to carry out one or two universal weeding and loosening of the soil for the planted forests to nurture the young forests and make them grow rapidly.

III.

The lack of seeds and seedlings has become the main reason why afforestation work cannot move forward rapidly. We should pay special attention to this work. Spring is the main season for completing the annual seedling cultivation task, so we must seize the opportunity and lay the foundation:

(1) Immediately conduct a universal inspection of existing nurseries. Any tree species selection, nursery settings, and management methods that do not meet the needs of afforestation or the requirements of the masses must be improved.

(2) Nurseries in various regions must ensure that technical errors are eliminated (such as covering the soil too thickly or too shallowly when sowing, or reluctantly carrying out seedling cultivation after the season has passed, or affecting seedling growth due to failure to arrange drought and flood prevention), rationally and economically use nursery land, and carry out timely fertilization, cultivation, weeding, and irrigation to increase seedling production. In addition, to supply high-quality cuttings needed for afforestation, a large number of mother tree forests should be built specifically for collecting cuttings, so that the practice of collecting branches from general old trees can be gradually stopped in the future.

(3) In addition to direct seeding afforestation this spring, all seeds collected last autumn should be used for seedling cultivation this spring. Various regions must immediately prepare nursery land and not miss the opportunity.

(4) Regions where seeds can be collected in spring and summer should make advance arrangements. For tree species with short germination power storage periods, the seeds should be sown as soon as they are collected.

(5) Solving the problem of seed and seedling shortage mainly relies on the masses, mobilizing the masses to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings themselves; more simple temporary nurseries should be set up and large-field management should be carried out; technical training must be given to the masses in seed collection and seedling cultivation, and they must be helped to solve difficulties.

IV.

Closing hillsides for afforestation is the best way to green vast barren mountains. In 1951, it was launched nationwide, completing 12.5 million mu, and many regions, such as Shandong and Hebei provinces, have gained a lot of experience. However, in some regions, the closing of hillsides for afforestation is "officially closed, but the people do not close," "closed in name but not in reality," and "hills are closed but not protected, hills are closed but not afforested," resulting in the closing of hillsides for afforestation becoming a formality without achieving results. To consolidate achievements and vigorously promote this work, various regions should take the following measures starting this spring:

(1) After the spring afforestation is completed, immediately organize forces to inspect the past work of closing hillsides for afforestation, focusing on understanding: Are the division of hillside areas, closed areas, pastoral areas, and logging areas, the period of closure and opening, and various systems and methods supported and implemented by the masses? What is the effect? And in response to its existing problems, deal with them in a timely manner, summarize experience, and further carry out future work of closing hillsides for afforestation.

(2) Barren mountains with no mother trees and no way to cultivate forests should be afforested after closure; residual forests should be strengthened for nurturing after closure to promote natural seeding; young forests cultivated by closing hillsides should be sorted out to retain high-quality tree species in order to grow into good forests.

(3) To encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for closing hillsides for afforestation and avoid disputes, various regions can refer to Shandong's experience and divide hills and delineate boundaries.

    中央人民政府林业部
    关于一九五二年春季造林工作的指示
    一
    造林是防旱防涝治本办法之一，各地应结合政务院关于防旱抗旱运动的决定的精神，大力开展造林工作。现在春季造林即将开始，根据以往经验，今春造林工作除应积极发动群众完成计划外，最重要的应把提高造林成活率作为主要奋斗目标，为此，各地对下列各项必须予以进行。
    （一）应向群众作深入的增产爱国教育，交清“谁种归谁”的政策，说明“造林十年，不愁吃穿”的好处，使群众“人人乐为”“管栽管活”。因此，造林前各县、区、村特别是区村应争取最大可能，普遍召开一次造林动员会议或工作会议，以便交流经验和进行具体布置。
    （二）根据“民造公助”的方针，积极推动合作造林。合作组织内部的利益关系，必须作明确合理的规定，并认真办理订合同、发股票等手续，以解除群众顾虑。至于究应推行公私合作或群众合作，应完全根据各地群众愿望来决定；公私合作不是为了分利，而是为了帮助群众解决困难，提高合作的信心。
    （三）迅速开始行动，配合中心工作，组织力量，明确分工，作好造林地覆查，制定实施计划。对群众力量的组织，种苗和工具的准备，均须有充分布置，务使各种工作环节互相衔接，作到“人不误苗”“苗不误人”。在时间上，一般应在春耕前把造林工作结束。
    （四）对造林所用种子或苗木进行严格选择。不宜直播的、或已失去发芽力的树木种子及受严重病害损伤、或已干燥的苗木，应一律禁止采用，以免浪费人力和物力。
    （五）造林运动开始后，要具体深入地进行技术指导，同时吸收群众经验，采用各种方式，作及时的传播。造林后要进行检查，并组织群众进行相互检查和评比，作到有奖励、有批评。造林成绩和经验（特别是新的经验）要及时总结上报。
    二
    一九五一年全国造林共为六百八十万亩，但一般成活率都很低，根据各地不完整的材料来统计，全国平均造林成活率仅为百分之六十五，也就是说已造的林至少已损失百分之三十五；为弥补这一缺陷，今春各地对以下两项工作必须进行：
    （一）普遍进行检查和补植，保证已造的幼林能够全部成林。
    （二）动员群众特别是妇女、儿童或学生对已造的林进行一次或两次普遍的锄草和松土工作，以抚育幼林，使其迅速成长。
    三
    种苗缺乏已成为目前造林工作不能迅速前进的主要原因，我们应特别重视这一工作。春季是完成全年育苗任务的主要季节，必须抓紧时机，打下基础：
    （一）立即普遍检查现有苗圃，凡树种的选择、苗圃的设置、经营的方式，不合造林需要、不合群众要求的，必须一律加以改进。
    （二）各地苗圃必须保证在技术上消除不应有的错误（如播种时覆土过厚或过浅，或季节已过才勉强进行育苗，或未布置防旱防涝而影响苗木生长等），合理地、经济地利用圃地及时进行施肥、中耕、除草、灌溉等工作，以提高苗木产量。此外，为供应造林所需的优良插穗，应大量营造专为采取插穗的母树林，俾今后逐步停止在一般老树上采取枝条。
    （三）去秋所采种子除今春直播造林外，应争取全部用于今春育苗，各地必须立即准备圃地，莫误时机。
    （四）春夏两季可以采到种子的地区，应预作布置，对发芽力保存期短的树种，其种子要随采随播。
    （五）解决种苗困难，主要依靠群众，发动群众自己采种，自己育苗；要多设简便的临时苗圃，进行大田式的经营；对群众采种育苗必须给以技术训练，并帮助他们解决困难。
    四
    封山育林是绿化广大荒山的最好办法，一九五一年已在全国范围内开展起来，完成一千二百五十万亩，许多地区如山东、河北等省获得不少经验。但也有若干地区的封山育林是“官封民不封”“明封暗不封”“封山未护山，封山未育林”，致使封山育林流于形式而未收到效果。为巩固成绩并大力推进这一工作，各地应从今春起采取如下措施：
    （一）春季造林结束后，立即组织力量检查过去的封山育林工作，注重了解：封山范围、封禁区、畜牧区、樵采区的划分，封禁与开放时期以及各种制度办法等是否为群众所拥护和执行？效果如何？并针对其存在问题，及时处理，总结经验，进一步开展今后的封山育林工作。
    （二）原无母树，无法育林的秃山，封禁后要进行造林；残存林封禁后要加强抚育，促进天然下种；经封山育成的幼林，应进行整理，保留优良树种，以期长成良好的森林。
    （三）为鼓励群众的封山育林情绪，避免纠纷，各地可参考山东经验，进行分山划界。
