    Beijing Tiancheng Grain Store Manager Zhang Fenglin
    Suppresses Workers, Evades National Taxes, Should Be Sanctioned
    Editor: We three workers (Wang Hengxuan, Jia Herui, Wang Zongyi) are constantly oppressed by manager Zhang Fenglin and others while working at the Tiancheng Grain Store opened by Zhang Fenglin and others. Among us three, one works at the counter, one delivers goods, and one watches the mill. We are busy all day long, getting a maximum of six hours of sleep each day. In June and July 1951, Wang Zongyi wanted to join the trade union, but Zhang Fenglin said, "It's not time for you to join the trade union yet!" The next day, Zhang Fenglin even went to Wang Zongyi's elder brother to ask him to stop Wang Zongyi from joining the trade union. After the movement against bribery, tax evasion, and tax avoidance began, Zhang Fenglin not only failed to confess voluntarily but intensified his suppression of workers, reducing their food rations (from one meal of coarse grains and one meal of fine grains per day to two meals of coarse grains). Zhang Fenglin even said, "It is what it is, eat it or don't, it's up to you!" He also used deceptive means to stop paying wages, saying, "Capital turnover is not working well. January wages will be paid as usual, February will be reported as business closure and wages will be stopped." In fact, his grain store's capital turnover is not bad at all. In the past year, he has evaded more than 88 million yuan in taxes. He is afraid of government investigation and wants to resist the government by closing down the business. When workers went to attend the meetings against bribery, tax evasion, and tax avoidance, Zhang Fenglin even beat Wang Zongyi for no reason. We firmly oppose Zhang Fenglin's behavior of oppressing workers and resisting the movement against bribery, tax evasion, and tax avoidance. We hope the government will impose legal sanctions on him.

### 北京天成粮食店经理张凤林  压制工人偷漏国税应受制裁

    北京天成粮食店经理张凤林
    压制工人偷漏国税应受制裁
    编辑同志：我们三个工人（王恒宣、贾贺瑞、王宗义），在张凤林等开设的天成粮食店工作，常受经理张凤林等压迫。我们三个人中，一个站柜，一个送货，一个看磨。我们整日忙得不可开交，每天最多睡六小时。一九五一年六、七月间，王宗义要参加工会，张凤林说：“你入工会还没到时候！”第二天张凤林还去找王宗义的哥哥，要他阻拦王宗义入工会。反行贿、反偷漏税运动开始后，张凤林不但没有自动坦白，反而变本加厉地压制工人，降低工人伙食（由每天一顿粗粮一顿细粮变为两顿都是粗粮）。张凤林还说：“就是这样，爱吃不吃，由你去！”他还用欺骗手段，停发工资，并说：“资金周转不灵，一月份工资照发，二月份报歇业停发。”其实，他的粮食店并不是资金周转不灵，一年来，他偷漏税就有八千八百多万元，他怕政府追查，想以歇业来对抗政府。当工人去参加反行贿、反偷漏税的会议时，张凤林还无故殴打王宗义。我们坚决反对张凤林压迫工人，抗拒反行贿、反偷漏税运动的行为，我们希望政府给他以法律制裁。
