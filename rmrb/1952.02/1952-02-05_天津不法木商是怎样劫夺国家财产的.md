How Unlawful Timber Merchants in Tianjin Looted State Property
    Han Youqin, Lin Mo

From the actions of some unlawful timber merchants in Tianjin who defrauded and robbed state property, we can see how rampant the bourgeoisie is in attacking the state and the people. Tianjin is the center for the sale of timber from the Northeast to the interior. A portion of the timber from North China, Central South China, Southwest China and other regions is also transported to Tianjin for sale. A large amount of timber needed for basic construction and national defense construction in many parts of the interior is purchased from Tianjin. Some unlawful timber merchants in Tianjin have seized upon this point and are nefariously manipulating the market, undermining national construction, and frantically using various fraudulent means to extract exorbitant profits. Towards the state, they are not just deceiving and stealing, but are openly robbing like bandits.

There are currently over 300 large and small timber merchants in Tianjin. Among them, 35 are large timber merchants, 78 are medium-sized timber merchants, and 222 are small timber merchants. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, most of these timber merchants suffered heavy losses. Some of the timber they had in stock was seized by the Kuomintang bandit troops to build bunkers and trenches before the liberation of Tianjin. When Tianjin was first liberated, many timber merchants had neither stock nor capital. For example, the Xinhua Timber Firm was unable to pay its employees' salaries for three months after liberation. With the government's loan assistance, their business has developed considerably with the progress of national construction. Even in the case of legitimate business, there are substantial profits to be made. However, many timber merchants are ungrateful and viciously and greedily use various methods to steal large amounts of state property.

How do some unlawful timber merchants steal and rob state property? In summary, there are the following methods:

    Sending spies, colluding with cadres, stealing economic intelligence, and monopolizing the timber market

The main timber merchants who control timber transactions in Tianjin are the nine major timber merchants, including Da Lai, Xinhua, Tong Qing, Heng Yu, and Xiang Sen. They are known as the "Nine Great Families" in the timber business. In 1950, they sent Li Fengyan (formerly an employee of Da Lai Timber Firm) into the Tianjin Trust Company through examination, where he took charge of the timber trading business, becoming their powerful spy. Whenever the trust company needed timber, and at what price, Li Fengyan would report it to the timber merchants in advance. Upon learning this, these profiteers would search and purchase all the timber in the market that the trust company urgently needed and hoard it, forcing the state to buy it at high prices. For example, in 1950, the Tianjin Trust Company purchased 8,000 ordinary timbers, originally priced at 40,000 yuan per tree, but the price was increased by one and a half times by the profiteers, who reaped nearly 500 million yuan in exorbitant profits. After Li Fengyan was investigated and arrested by the government, the profiteers changed their methods and directly surrounded the purchasing units of the central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Railways, and the military in Tianjin, and wooed and corrupted the purchasing personnel of these units to probe for inside information. The manager of Heng Yu Timber Firm said that they were: "Business goes where bribery goes." Their method of attacking cadres was to frantically surround them, invite them to eat and drink, invite them to watch operas, give them money, seduce cadres to prostitute, and consume drugs, until the cadres were completely degenerated and corrupted and fell into their bewitching trap. The Xinhua Timber Firm alone bribed 104 cadres from 63 organizations. Wang Zengshou, a purchasing agent of the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, was once surrounded by a group of timber merchants. Wang Zengshou was initially afraid to accept bribes, but the profiteers dragged him to a restaurant, got him drunk, and then stuffed money into his pockets. When the profiteers learned that he was not married, they first took him to play with "hostesses," and further, the manager of Linji Timber Firm took him to openly prostitute. Huang Ziming, the manager of Da Lai Timber Firm, said: "We are good friends, I will introduce my niece to you." Wang Changlu, the manager of Tongxing Timber Firm, said: "I have two wives, come to my house to play!" As a result, the profiteers delivered bad timber, and Wang Zengshou persuaded his superiors to accept it; Wang Zengshou revealed the bid floor to the profiteers. Wang Zengshou was dizzy all day long, and the profiteers could say whatever they wanted.

These unlawful timber merchants captured many staff members like Wang Zengshou. The profiteers then used these degenerated staff members they had captured to carry out various illegal activities. For example, in 1950, when the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry purchased fir, Xiang Sen and other eight timber firms learned the "bid floor" from "inside sources" before bidding and secretly agreed that only Linji Timber Firm would bid slightly lower. After Linji Timber Firm concluded the transaction with the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, the business would be divided into four parts and the profits would be divided into eight parts. Four of them did not spend a penny, and each shared a profit of more than 25 million yuan. The magnitude of the profiteering can be imagined.

    Signing contracts and delaying delivery, defrauding the state of large amounts of funds, and engaging in various speculative activities

In the years since liberation, unlawful timber merchants in Tianjin have signed hundreds of contracts with certain economic and military departments of the state. After signing the contracts, these departments would pay the profiteers 60%, 70% or even 100% of the deposit in advance. After signing the contracts, many profiteers often delayed delivery for half a year or a year under the pretext of not being able to get railway cars, and evaded the punishment they deserved through bribed cadres. In fact, they were using large deposits to do speculative business. Some unlawful timber merchants believed that signing contracts and taking deposits was equivalent to using state money for their own business for nothing. Sometimes shop assistants reminded the capitalists that the contract was about to expire. The manager would say, "What contract? What do they (referring to government officials) know!"

According to the investigation, the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry alone purchased 40 batches of timber from March to December 1950, worth nearly 12 billion yuan. They signed 50 contracts with 21 timber firms, with a total advance payment of more than 7.16 billion yuan. Among these 50 contracts, only 10 had fewer problems in the process of performance. The remaining 40 were not fulfilled on time. Some even dragged on for 14 months.

Many profiteers intended to deceive the state when signing contracts. For example, Lihua Trading Company said that it had a large amount of stock when signing the contract, but in fact it did not have a single timber. They led the purchasing personnel to see other people's timber, and thus defrauded the state of more than 500 million yuan in deposits by the method of "pointing at the mountain and selling mills." The contract stipulated that Lihua should deliver the goods in two batches in June and July 1950, but only half of them were delivered by the end of September. During the performance of the contract, Lihua tried every means to deny it and took advantage of loopholes everywhere, using bad goods to top up good goods, filling hollow rotten wood with wooden sticks, and covering cracked and pitted wood with sawdust and dirt, and entangled with the inspectors in every possible way. In the most serious period, four or five inspectors could only inspect a few to twenty or thirty timbers a day. What is even more heinous is that: the Lihua capitalists not only cheated the state in this way, but also filed a complaint with the court against the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau in August 1950, accusing it of delaying the inspection and making them unable to deliver the goods on time! The capitalists have become rampant to this point, but the leading cadres of the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau are still timidly making concessions and bowing their heads to the capitalists, begging them to settle the case. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court also had such confused judges who "reconciled" the big fraud case of capitalists harming the state.

    Defrauding the state of certificates, falsely requisitioning railway cars, buying low-priced rationed goods and selling them at high prices

The Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau had already been beaten and suffered losses, and saw clearly the vicious and rogue face of Lihua capitalists. Half a month before the case was concluded, it issued certificates for them to transport timber back from the Northeast at the request of Lihua capitalists. It also failed to recover the certificates after the case was concluded, allowing them to continue using them for eight months, defrauding more than 20 railway cars in the name of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, transporting timber back, and obtaining huge profits. Many unlawful timber merchants in Tianjin have defrauded the state of funds in this way, and then falsely requisitioned railway cars, bought timber back from the Northeast at low prices, and then made waves in Tianjin, engaging in speculation and profiteering, and selling them privately. Da Lai, Xiang Sen and other timber firms signed a contract with the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau and obtained more than 580 million yuan in deposits, and then settled a batch of timber from the Northeast Forestry Bureau. Then they cheated on both sides. On the one hand, they told the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau that the Northeast was short of railway cars and the timber could not be transported. On the other hand, they told the Northeast Forestry Bureau that the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau did not want the timber and wanted to return the money. The Northeast Forestry Bureau had no way to return the money, so it was forced to allocate timber to Da Lai and Xiang Sen from Tianjin. After the profiteers got the timber, they did not hand it over to the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, but sold it privately on the market at high prices.

If timber merchants get certificates from state organs to buy rationed goods in the Northeast and transport them to Tianjin for sale, they can often get 60% to 70% to 100% profit.

    "Eating dimensions," using bad goods to top up good goods, evading taxes, and seizing multiple layers of exorbitant profits

When timber merchants buy timber in the Northeast, the dimensions are generally one-tenth larger. They secretly ate this part of the excess when reselling it. When selling a large batch of timber, timber merchants often replaced good timber with rotten or inferior timber. Because timber is not as easy to calculate accurately as other goods, some unlawful timber merchants often deceive and woo purchasing and inspection personnel, and are sloppy on the straightness, thickness, thinness, and quality of the timber, causing buyers to suffer losses. Because there are these malpractices in the transaction, timber merchants can obtain multiple layers of exorbitant profits. According to some unlawful timber merchants' confessions, a batch of goods can often get 30% to 70% profit from buying to selling.

As for tax evasion, none of the unlawful timber merchants who have been reported did not evade taxes. Generally, private merchants who evade taxes have a false account book, but these upstart unlawful timber merchants have three or five: one is for selling timber, one is for selling gold, one is for lending money at high interest rates, and some even have one for hiding enemy property. Because there are too many ways for them to rob state property, they cannot remember them if there are too few account books.

    Crush their frantic attacks

The frantic economic and political attacks of unlawful timber merchants in Tianjin on the state and the people in the past three years have caused incalculable losses to the state's construction work. When the Central People's Government promulgated the decree on unified management of timber in August 1951, they still resisted in every possible way and did not implement it conscientiously. For a period of time, they even united to manipulate the Tianjin timber market, threatening not to sell timber to the state. They treated the People's Government with a completely hostile attitude. After the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud of state property campaign was launched in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles, despite repeated persuasion and education from the government and the people, they had no remorse. Unlawful timber merchants led by Wang Weisheng, the manager of Da Lai Timber Firm, held the trade association, united the industry to refuse to confess, and undermined the employees' reporting. The vast number of employees, citizens, and government cadres in Tianjin are extremely indignant at their illegal acts and demand that the government give them severe sanctions. On January 22, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court arrested and brought to justice 15 unlawful timber merchants including Wang Weisheng. In response, some bourgeois gentlemen in Tianjin shouted loudly about "not fighting too excessively." May I ask, can the people coexist peacefully with such ferocious, greedy, and shameless profiteers?

    天津不法木商是怎样劫夺国家财产的
    韩友勤  林沫
    从天津某些不法木商诈骗、抢劫国家财产的行为中，我们可以看到资产阶级是怎样猖狂地向国家和人民进攻的。天津是东北的木材向关内进销的集中地。华北、中南、西南等地区的一部分木材，也运到天津来销售。关内很多地方在基本建设和国防建设中所需要的大批木材，有很多是购自天津。天津一些不法木商看准了这一点，就可恶地操纵市场，破坏国家建设，疯狂地以种种欺诈手段套取暴利。对国家，他们已经不只是欺骗和盗窃，简直是像强盗一样地公开进行劫夺了。
    天津市现有大、小木商三百多家。其中大木商有三十五家，中等木商七十八家，小木商二百二十二家。这些木商在国民党反动统治时期，大部分赔累不堪。所存的一些木料，在天津解放前被国民党匪军抢去修筑了碉堡和战壕。天津刚解放时，很多木商既没有存货，又没有资金。如新华木行在解放三个月后还没钱给职工发薪金。经人民政府贷款扶助，随着国家建设的进展，他们的营业有了相当的发展。就是在正当经营情况下，也都有厚利可图。但很多木商却忘恩负义，凶恶地、贪婪地用种种办法大量盗窃国家财产。
    一些不法木商是怎样盗窃和抢劫国家财产的呢？总括起来，有以下几种办法：
    派遣坐探，勾结干部，盗窃经济情报，垄断木材市场
    操纵天津木材交易的主要有大来、新华、同庆、恒裕、祥森等九家大木商。在木商业中被称为“九大家”。一九五○年，他们曾派李峰砚（原为大来木行职员）以投考方式钻入天津市信托公司，掌管了木材交易业务，成了他们得力的坐探。信托公司什么时候需要什么木材，价格如何，都由李峰砚事先报告给木商。这些奸商得知后，就把市场上为信托公司所急需的木材搜购一空，囤积起来，迫使国家出高价收买。如一九五○年天津市信托公司购买了八千棵通材，原来市价每棵四万元，经奸商操纵，提高价格一倍半，奸商获暴利近五亿元。李峰砚被政府查知逮捕后，奸商们就改变了办法，分别直接包围中央重工业部、轻工业部、铁路、军事等部门在天津的采购单位，拉拢和腐化这些单位的采购人员，探听内情。恒裕木行的经理说他们是：“生意做到那里，行贿走到那里。”他们进攻干部的办法，是疯狂地包围上去，请吃喝、请看戏、送钱、勾引干部嫖妓女、吸食毒品，直到使干部完全堕落腐化，陷入他们的迷魂阵。仅新华木行，就贿赂了六十三个机关的一百零四个干部。中央重工业部钢铁工业局天津事务所的采购人员王增寿，曾被一群木商包围起来。王增寿最初不敢接受贿赂，奸商们就把他拉到饭馆里，把他灌醉，然后把钱塞在他的口袋里。当奸商们知道他还没有结婚，就先拉他去玩“女招待”，进一步，林记木行的经理就拉他公开嫖妓女。大来木行的经理黄子明说：“咱们是好朋友，我把我的侄女儿介绍给你。”同兴木行的经理王长禄说：“我有两个太太，到我家来玩吧！”于是，奸商们交了不好的木材，王增寿说通上级收下了；投标的底价，王增寿泄露给奸商了。王增寿一天昏昏沉沉，奸商们说什么是什么。
    这些不法木商俘掳了不少像王增寿这样的工作人员。奸商们就利用他们俘掳的这些蜕化了的工作人员，进行种种非法活动。如一九五○年重工业部钢铁工业局天津事务所购买杉木时，祥森等八家木行在投标前从“内线”知道了“标底”，暗中议定：只让林记木行一家标价稍低，林记木行和钢铁工业局天津事务所成交后，生意由四家分作，利润由八家分吞。其中四家一钱未出，每家也分利二千五百多万元。暴利之大，可想而知。
    订了合同拖延交货，骗取国家大量资金，进行种种投机活动
    天津市的不法木商在解放后数年来，曾和国家某些经济、军事部门订过数百份合同。这些部门在订立合同后，就预付给奸商百分之六十、七十甚至百分之百的定金。很多奸商在订立合同后，往往藉口要不到车皮，拖延半年、一年不交货，并且通过受贿的干部逃避应受的处罚，实际上他们是拿着大量定金做投机生意。一些不法木商认为订合同、拿定金，等于白使国家钱来做自己的生意。有时店员提醒资方说，合同快到期了。经理则说：“什么合同不合同？他们（指政府工作人员）懂得什么！”
    据调查，仅中央重工业部钢铁工业局天津事务所
    一个单位，自一九五○年三月到十二月，即采购木材四十批，总值近一百二十亿元。他们和二十一家木商订立了五十份合同，共预付定金七十一亿六千多万元。在这五十份合同中，只有十份在履行中发生问题较少。其余四十份，都没有按期实现。有的甚至拖延十四个月之久。
    有很多奸商，订合同的时候就存心欺骗国家。如利华贸易公司在订合同时说自己有大批存货，实际上一根木材也没有，他们带领采购人员去看的是别家的木材，就这样以“指山卖磨”的办法骗取了国家五亿元以上的定金。合同规定利华应在一九五○年六月、七月份两批把货交完，而到九月底才交了一半。在履行合同期间，利华曾百般抵赖，处处钻空子，用坏货顶好货，把空心朽木塞上木棍，把有裂缝和凹坑的木材，用锯末、泥土糊上，和验收人员百般纠缠。最严重的时期，四、五个验收人员每天只能验收几根到二、三十根木材。更可恶的是：利华资方不但这样来坑骗国家，在一九五○年八月反向法院控告钢铁工业局天津事务所拖延验收，使他们不能如期交货！资本家已经猖狂到了这种地步，而钢铁工业局天津事务所的领导干部却还在怯懦地向资本家让步、低头，向他们哀求和解了案。天津市人民法院也就有那样糊涂的裁判人员，把资本家坑害国家的大骗案“和解”处理了。
    骗取国家证明文件，冒名要车皮，买低价配售货高价出卖
    钢铁工业局天津事务所已经挨了打，吃了亏，看清了利华资方凶恶、无赖的面目，而在案件了结前半个月，却又应利华资方的要求，给他们开了从东北运回木材的证明文件；在案件了结后也不把证明文件收回，使他们继续使用了八个月之久，以钢铁工业局的名义骗到了二十来个车皮，运回木材，获取暴利。天津的很多不法木商，大多是这样骗到了国家资金，然后又冒名要到车皮，低价从东北买回木材，然后在天津兴风作浪，投机倒把，私自出售。大来、祥森等木行和钢铁工业局天津事务所签订合同并获得五亿八千多万元的定金后，定妥东北林务总局一批木材。然后他们两头进行欺骗。一面向钢铁工业局天津事务所说：东北缺乏车皮，木材运不来。一面向东北林务总局说：钢铁工业局不要木材了，要退回现款。东北林务总局没有办法退回现款，就被迫从天津拨付给大来、祥森以木材。奸商拿到木材后，不交钢铁工业局天津事务所，却私自在市场高利出售。
    木商如果拿到国家机关的证明文件，到东北买到配售货，运到天津出卖，往往可以得到百分之六、七十到百分之百的利润。
    “吃尺寸”，以坏充好，偷税漏税，攫取重重暴利
    木商们在东北购买木材时，尺寸一般大出十分之一。这一部分长余，他们在转卖时就私吃了。木商在出卖大批木料时，又往往以腐朽的或较次的木料顶替好木料。因木料不像其他货物那样易于精确计算，所以一些不法木商们往往欺骗和拉拢采购、验收人员，在木材的曲直、粗细、厚薄及质量的好坏上打马虎，使买主吃亏。因为在交易中有这些弊端，木商们就可以获得重重暴利。据一些不法木商自供，一批货从买到卖，往往可以得到百分之三十到百分之七十的暴利。
    至于偷税，被检举的不法木商没有一个不偷的。一般偷税的私商有一本假账，而这些暴发起来的不法木商们，有的却有三本、五本：一本是捣卖木材的，一本是捣卖黄金的，一本是放高利贷的，有人还有一本隐藏敌产的。因为他们抢劫国家财产的方法太多了，账本少了记不清。
    粉碎他们的疯狂进攻
    天津的不法木商们三年来在经济上和政治上向国家和人民猖狂进攻，使国家建设工作遭受了难以计算的损失。当一九五一年八月中央人民政府公布统一管理木材的法令后，他们还曾百般抵抗，不认真执行。有一个时期，他们甚至联合起来操纵天津木材市场，以不卖给国家木材来进行威胁。他们完全以敌对的态度对待人民政府。当这次天津市工商界反行贿、反偷税、反对诈骗国家财产的运动开展以后，虽经政府和人民多次向他们说服教育，他们却毫无悔过之心。以大来木行经理王伟生为首的不法木商们，更把持着同业公会，联合同业拒不坦白，破坏职工的检举。天津市广大职工、市民及机关干部对他们的这些不法行为极为愤慨，要求政府给他们以严厉制裁。一月二十二日，天津市人民法院把王伟生等十五个不法木商逮捕法办。对此，天津市某些资产阶级的大人先生们还大叫所谓“不要斗争得太过火”。试问，对于这样一些穷凶极恶、贪婪无耻的奸商，人民能和他们和平共居么？
