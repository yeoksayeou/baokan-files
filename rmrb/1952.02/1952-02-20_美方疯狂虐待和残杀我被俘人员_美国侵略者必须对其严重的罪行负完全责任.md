Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: While the U.S. side representatives at the Korean armistice talks continue to insist on their absurd demand for so-called "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war, the American aggressors are employing extremely shameless means to subject our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps to all kinds of abuse, insult, and arbitrary killing. They are also forcibly conducting fascist education, attempting to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs.

U.S. news agencies and newspapers, in recent news reports, have revealed the appalling and serious crimes of the American aggressors in abusing and insulting our captured personnel. According to a United Press dispatch from Geoje Island on January 20th, "Among the approximately 17,000 Chinese prisoners detained in the Allied Forces' No. 1 Prisoner-of-War Camp, ... at least 3,000 have had anti-communist slogans tattooed on their bodies." "Prisoners with tattoos can be seen everywhere in the prisoner-of-war camp, and most of the tattoos are anti-communist slogans." "The most common are the Chinese characters 'Oppose Communism Resist Russia', and sometimes there are also English versions of 'Oppose Communism Resist Russia'."

The American aggressors also brutally tortured and killed our captured personnel in the prisoner-of-war camps. The same news acknowledged that "In the officers' detention camp, a straightforward communist was hung up and beaten unconscious." The next day, "he and fifteen other companions" were transferred to another location, which, according to United Press, "was specially prepared for some stubborn communists." United Press admitted that "the center of the concentration camp has become an island of terror," "torture and assassination are intertwined into a terrifying picture in the daily life of prisoners."

According to foreign newspapers, the American aggressors also transferred a large number of "instructors" from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan to forcibly conduct fascist education on our captured personnel, and forced them to join the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps." United Press admitted that prisoners were often forced "to listen to 'propaganda and education' reports by American officers or Chinese Kuomintang instructors." Despite the fact that the American aggressors have adopted such barbaric and shameless means, they are still unable to subdue our captured personnel. Even the American aggressors themselves have no confidence in the effectiveness of their forced training. Morane, the person in charge of prisoner-of-war camp management, said in distress, "You can't see through their hearts. You have to split their heads open to know what they are thinking. How can you tell what they really want?" A reporter for "The Christian Science Monitor" also admitted in a commentary on this forced education program on December 1st last year: "It seems that most people have not been moved."

In order to achieve their goal of detaining our captured personnel, the U.S. side also shamelessly fabricated various myths about our captured personnel "swearing oaths" and "writing blood letters" to express their unwillingness to be repatriated, attempting to deceive the people of the world.

The people of the world must see through the sinister conspiracy of the American aggressors from these facts of the American aggressors killing, abusing, and insulting our captured personnel. Originally, the issue of the arrangement of prisoners of war in the fourth item of the armistice negotiations had been cleared of all obstacles due to the repeated efforts of our representatives. However, in order to conspire to detain a large number of our captured personnel, the U.S. side stubbornly insisted on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" plan, which had long been refuted by our side, in the meeting, and carried out crazy abuse and insults against our captured personnel, resulting in the fourth item of the agenda having been discussed for more than two months since it began on December 11th last year, and still has not reached an agreement. Therefore, the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for delaying the negotiations, and must bear full responsibility for the crimes of killing, abusing, and insulting our captured personnel.

### 美方疯狂虐待和残杀我被俘人员  美国侵略者必须对其严重的罪行负完全责任

    美方疯狂虐待和残杀我被俘人员
    美国侵略者必须对其严重的罪行负完全责任
    【新华社十八日讯】和美方代表在朝鲜停战谈判会议中继续坚持其所谓战俘“自愿遣返”的荒谬要求同时，美国侵略者正施用极端无耻的手段，在俘虏营中对我方被俘人员百般虐待、侮辱与任意残杀，并强迫进行法西斯教育，企图扣留我方被俘人员送交蒋介石与李承晚匪帮。
    美方通讯社、报纸在最近的新闻报道中，曾透露了美国侵略者虐待和侮辱我方被俘人员的令人发指的严重罪行。据合众社巨济岛一月二十日电透露：“被拘留在联军第一俘虏营的差不多一万七千名中国俘虏中，……至少有三千人身上已刺了反共标语。”“俘虏营内到处可以看见身上刺字的俘虏，大多数的刺字都是反共的口号。”“最常见的是中文的‘反共抗俄’的字句，有时也有英文的‘反共抗俄’的字句。”
    美国侵略者并在俘虏营残暴地拷打和残杀我被俘人员。该消息承认：“在军官的拘留营内，一个说话直率的共产党人，被吊起来打得人事不知。”第二天，“他和另外十五名同伴”就被调到另一个处所，据合众社说：“那是专为一些顽固不化的共产党人预备的。”合众社承认：“集中营中心变成了一个恐怖之岛”，“酷刑、暗杀在俘虏日常生活中交织成一幅恐怖的图画。”
    据外国报纸透露：美国侵略者又从台湾蒋匪帮那里调去大批“教官”，对我方被俘人员强迫进行法西斯教育，并逼迫他们参加所谓“反共救国团”。合众社承认：俘虏们常被强迫“去听美国军官或中国国民党教官的‘宣传和教育’的报告”。尽管美国侵略者采取了如此野蛮和卑鄙无耻的手段，但是仍无法使我方被俘人员屈服。甚至连美国侵略者自己对于他们这种强迫训练的效果，也毫无信心。俘虏营管理方面的负责人摩兰苦恼地说：“你没法看透他们的心。你只有把他们的头劈开，才能知道他们是怎样想的。你怎能说出他们真正希望什么呢？”“基督教科学箴言报”记者在去年十二月一日评论这种强迫教育计划时也承认：“看来，大多数人都没有受到感动。”
    美方为了达到其扣留我方被俘人员的目的，还无耻地捏造了我被俘人员“宣誓”、“写血书”表示不愿遣返的种种神话，妄图欺骗世界人民。
    全世界人民必须从美国侵略者残杀、虐待和侮辱我方被俘人员的这些事实中，看清美国侵略者的罪恶阴谋。本来，停战谈判第四项议程关于俘虏的安排问题，由于我方代表的一再努力，各种障碍均已扫除。但是，美方为了阴谋扣留我方大批被俘人员的罪恶目的，在会议中顽固地坚持早已被我方驳得体无完肤的所谓“自愿遣返”方案，并对我被俘人员进行了疯狂的虐待和侮辱，致使第四项议程自去年十二月十一日开始讨论以来，经过了二个多月，迄今仍未能取得协议。因此，美方必须对拖延谈判负完全责任，并必须对残杀、虐待和侮辱我方被俘人员的罪行负完全责任。
