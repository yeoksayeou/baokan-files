Leading Cadres of the Biological Products Laboratory of the Central South Ministry of Health Are Invaded by Bourgeois Ideology; Great Waste in Construction and Equipment of New Building

The newly built building of the Biological Products Laboratory of the Central South Military and Political Committee's Ministry of Health has caused great waste in construction and equipment due to the "love of ostentation" by leading cadres.

The building, recently completed, used building materials such as white cement made in Britain and America, steel windows made in Belgium, automatic curtains made in Japan, flooring and office desks made of American yellow pine, doors and cabinets made of Malaysian urea-formaldehyde panels, and the kitchen stove tops and toilet walls were covered with British tiles, and the toilet sinks also came from London. People in the institute said: "Apart from the land and the people, most of the things came from capitalist countries."

Although the building materials and interior equipment had arrived in China before liberation, and although people in the institute plausibly argued that the market price of foreign goods was cheaper than domestic goods at the time of purchase, the fact that a four-story building's majority of construction materials and equipment were a collection of products from capitalist countries fully exposed the worship of capitalist countries by the institute's leadership.

The director, Yang Yongnian, is a typical figure who "loves ostentation." Under his leadership, the waste in equipment at the institute is shocking. Taking the toilets as an example: each toilet is equipped with an automatic urinal. After 6:00 p.m., all the staff leave the building and do not return to work until the next day, during which time the building is empty for fifteen hours. The automatic urinal flushes every half hour, which is thirty times in fifteen hours; each flush uses four gallons of water. With seven toilets, 840 gallons of water are wasted every night, totaling 25,200 gallons of water wasted each month. The installation of electric lights is also extremely extravagant. A short indoor corridor has seven large chandeliers and seven fluorescent lights. The packaging room was bright enough with eight lights, but instead it was equipped with seven large chandeliers and eighteen fluorescent lights. A very small library was equipped with six fluorescent lights and two large chandeliers. The small kitchen was entirely tiled and equipped with four large chandeliers. In order to clean two carpets that were three feet wide and three zhang long, an electric vacuum cleaner was specially purchased from Shanghai. The floor of the auditorium is waxed at least once a month, costing more than 600,000 yuan each time. For wiping the glass, towels were initially used, but later changed to dragon head fine cloth, which was discarded after each use.

Due to poor engineering design, there was also a lot of waste during the construction process. According to preliminary statistics, the additional labor and material costs for only six projects—earthwork, electrical, refrigeration, plumbing, steel windows, and terrazzo—amounted to more than 1.892 billion yuan. The labor and materials wasted due to changes in the project, for only four projects including earthwork, electrical, refrigeration, and steel windows, amounted to more than 93 million yuan. Due to the lack of careful calculation in the purchase of materials, excessive inventory was purchased, resulting in a large amount of capital tied up.

The director of this laboratory, Yang Yongnian, is a technical worker who has lived abroad for a long time and received bourgeois education. After liberation, he served the people's cause and indeed put in a lot of effort in building this building. However, the influence of bourgeois ideology he received in the past has not been overcome. The deputy director of the laboratory, Liu Chongzeng, and the Minister of Health, Qi Zhonghuan, and Deputy Minister, Lin Zhihan, and others, rarely helped Yang Yongnian overcome his old ideological consciousness. Liu Chongzeng's private life was indecent and seriously divorced from the masses. Qi Zhonghuan and Lin Zhihan had a high-ranking bureaucratic style. During the construction of this building, they rarely conducted in-depth inspections. Liu Chongzeng, Qi Zhonghuan and others were not completely unaware of some of the extravagance and waste in the Biological Products Laboratory beforehand, but they were too accommodating to the technical personnel and did not patiently conduct persuasion and education, so some of the extravagance and waste could not be corrected in time.

Qi Zhonghuan and Lin Zhihan themselves have hedonistic behaviors. In August of last year, Qi Zhonghuan and Lin Zhihan misappropriated more than 40,000 Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to more than 300 million yuan in RMB) of foreign exchange from the China Pharmaceutical Company's Central South Branch for purchasing medicines and bought two American-made Chevrolet cars from Hong Kong. Qi and Lin also concurrently held positions in the Fourth Field Army's Health Department. They often accepted gifts from Zhu Guang, the person in charge of the Fourth Field Army's Health Department and the Central South Health Department's office in Shanghai. Qi Zhonghuan's wife, Song Wenjing, and Lin Zhihan's wife, Zhang Yingqing (both of whom work in the Central South Health Department), lead very extravagant lives, which Qi Zhonghuan and Lin Zhihan turn a blind eye to. Because Qi Zhonghuan and Lin Zhihan themselves have been invaded by bourgeois ideology, they lost the vigilance they should have when this poisonous bacteria launched a massive attack on the Biological Products Laboratory.

The relevant leading organs should continue to conduct in-depth inspections of the extravagance and waste in the Biological Products Laboratory and the Ministry of Health of Central South in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and thoroughly correct them.

### 中南卫生部生物制品实验所领导干部受资产阶级思想侵袭  新建大楼在建筑和设备上都有很大浪费

    中南卫生部生物制品实验所领导干部受资产阶级思想侵袭  
    新建大楼在建筑和设备上都有很大浪费
    中南军政委员会卫生部生物制品实验所新建大楼，由于领导干部“爱好排场”，在建筑和设备方面造成很大的浪费。
    这一实验所新落成的大楼，建筑用的材料，白水泥是英美出品，钢窗是比利时出品，自动窗帘是日本货，地板和办公用的桌子是用美国的洋松做的，门和橱柜是马来亚的柳胺板做的，厨房的灶面和厕所的墙壁，铺着英国的瓷砖，厕所的洗手盆也来自伦敦。所里的人说：“除了土地和人以外，大部分东西都是从资本主义国家来的。”
    尽管建筑材料和室内设备，在解放前就运到了中国，尽管所里的人振振有辞地说：当时采购的市价，外国货较本国货还便宜。但是，一座四层大楼，大部分建筑材料和设备，集资本主义国家产品的大成，这就充分暴露了所内领导同志有崇拜资本主义国家的思想。
    所长杨永年就是一个“爱好排场”的典型人物，在他领导下，该所设备方面的浪费是惊人的。单以厕所来说：每个厕所，都装置了自动小便箱。下午六点钟以后，工作人员都离开了大楼，一直到第二天才上班，这中间就有十五个钟头大楼是空着无人的。自动小便箱每隔半小时放水一次，十五个钟头就是三十次；每次放水四加仑，七个厕所，每晚放水八百四十加仑，一个月浪费水二万五千二百加仑。从安装电灯来说，也是极其铺张的，短短的室内走廊，安装了七盏大吊灯，七支日光灯。包装室本来八盏灯就够亮了，却装上了七盏大吊灯，十八支日光灯。一间很小的书库，装上了六支日光灯，二盏大吊灯。小厨房全部铺着瓷砖，装了四盏大吊灯。为了打扫两块三尺宽、三丈长的地毯，特从上海买回电力吸尘机。礼堂的地板，每月至少涂蜡一次，每次就得花六十多万元。抹玻璃，起先用毛巾，以后改用龙头细布，抹一次就不再用了。
    由于工程设计不周密，在建设过程中也有许多浪费，仅土木、电气、冷气、水管、钢窗和磨石子六项工程中途增加的工料费，据初步统计，就有十八亿九千二百多万元。因更改工程所浪费的工料，仅土木、电气、冷气、钢窗四项工程就有九千三百多万元。由于采购材料没有精打细算，购置过多的存料，还积压了大量资金。
    这个实验所的所长杨永年，是一位久居国外长期受着资产阶级教育的技术工作者。解放后，他服务于人民的事业，建筑这座大楼时，的确出过不少力。但是，他过去所受资产阶级思想的影响，一直没有克服。实验所副所长刘崇曾和卫生部部长齐仲桓、副部长林之翰等，也很少帮助杨永年克服旧的思想意识。刘崇曾私生活不检点，严重地脱离群众，齐仲桓、林之翰有高高在上的官僚主义作风，在这所大楼施工期间，他们极少深入检查。刘崇曾、齐仲桓等并不是事先一点也不知道生物制品实验所的某些铺张浪费现象，但他们对技术人员过分迁就，没有耐心地进行说服教育，某些铺张浪费便得不到及时的纠正。
    齐仲桓、林之翰本身有着享乐行为，去年八月，齐仲桓、林之翰挪用中国医药公司中南区公司购买药品的外汇四万余元港币（合人民币三亿余元），从香港买回美造雪佛兰汽车二辆。齐、林均兼职第四野战军卫生部，他们经常接受四野卫生部和中南卫生部驻上海办事处负责人朱光所送的礼物。齐仲桓的妻子宋文静和林之翰的妻子张映清（都在中南卫生部工作），生活非常奢靡，齐仲桓、林之翰却熟视无睹。由于齐仲桓、林之翰本身受到资产阶级思想的侵袭，当这一有毒的细菌向生物制品实验所大量进攻的时候，他们就失却了应有的警惕。
    有关的领导机关对于中南卫生部生物制品实验所和卫生部的铺张浪费等现象，应当在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中继续深入地进行检查，彻底地纠正。  （本报记者沈石）
