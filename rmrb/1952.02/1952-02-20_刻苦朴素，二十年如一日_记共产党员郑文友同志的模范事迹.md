    Hardworking and Simple, Consistent for Twenty Years
    ——An Account of the Model Deeds of Communist Party Member Comrade Zheng Wenyou
    Sun Jinmin
    Communist Party member Zheng Wenyou is fifty-five years old this year. Since he joined the revolution, for twenty years, whether in the countryside or in the city, he has always maintained a hardworking and simple style, diligently working.
    In his twenty years of struggle, because he wholeheartedly fought for the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people, he was assessed as a work model and labor model four times before going south, and also won the glorious title of Second-Class People's Hero. In 1949, at the Hero Meeting of the × Corps of the ×× Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he was gloriously elected as a First-Class People's Hero, and at the same time won the glorious title of Model Communist Party Member. Now, he is the Traffic Detachment Leader of the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, and has been awarded a first-class merit twice.
    Since Zheng Wenyou joined the Red Fourth Army in 1933, he has experienced countless battles and was wounded five times. In 1936, in the battle to capture Gulang City in Gansu, he fought the enemy while wounded, and remained on the front line. Due to the fierce battle, he fainted. When he woke up, the troops had already withdrawn. He endured the pain of his arm and leg injuries, climbed out of Gulang City, and climbed over a frozen river. It took him two full days and nights to find someone. Several months later, he finally found his troops.
    Zheng Wenyou behaved bravely and tenaciously in battle, and in his usual lifestyle and work style, he was consistently honest and selfless, hardworking and simple. In 1937, he was transferred to the post of Master Sergeant Quartermaster. In order to save manpower, he always carried the burden himself to buy vegetables. Once, he went to the Luzhong Industry and Commerce Bureau to buy pens and toothbrushes. When he calculated the bill after returning, he found that the comrades in the Industry and Commerce Bureau had made a mistake and undercharged him by two thousand yuan. He immediately sent the money back. He said, "If I covet small gains, I would be letting down the Party and the people's training, and I would lose the excellent qualities of a revolutionary worker." When he was the administrator of the Third Hospital of the Luzhong Military Region Health Department, he not only often traveled long distances, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to buy cheaper vegetables, but also actively organized production, saving more than six million yuan (Beihai currency) for the public in one year. Everyone said, "Zheng Wenyou was promoted from Master Sergeant Quartermaster to administrator. For seven years, millions upon millions of banknotes passed through his hands, but he never got greedy, his heart never wavered, and he never embezzled or wasted a penny of public money!" Once, the director of the Third Hospital of the Health Department wanted to improve the food and said to him, "Go ahead and improve the food, I'll be responsible if there's a problem!" The implication was to use the production funds to improve living conditions. But Zheng Wenyou refused, saying, "Using public funds to improve our own lives is stealing public wealth. The country's economic situation is still very difficult, and the people's lives are also very difficult. We only need to maintain a certain standard of living!" During the increasingly difficult war years, the public's economic situation once faced difficulties. After obtaining the consent of the leadership and comrades, Zheng Wenyou turned over the more than six million yuan (Beihai currency) of production funds to the public. Afterwards, the director said with shame, "Comrade Zheng Wenyou educated me, made me draw a clear line between public and private, and realized the meaning and role of frugality. I want to learn his noble Communist Party member qualities!" On the one hand, Zheng Wenyou always paid attention to saving public financial and material resources. On the other hand, he carefully planned and tried to improve the lives of his comrades as much as possible, providing nutritious food to the wounded and sick soldiers, so that they could recover their health as soon as possible. At that time, the "Pioneer News" of the Luzhong Military Region often praised him, and he was recognized by everyone as a labor model.
    In the long-term arduous battles and work, he bled and fell ill, affecting his health. The superiors took care of him due to his old age and weak health, and issued him old-age pension and allowances; but he believed that his body could still support his work, so he often used this money to buy food for the wounded and sick soldiers. He also often gave his new clothes to the wounded and sick soldiers to wear, while he himself wore old ones. The shoes he wore were patched and re-patched.
    In 1947, the troops conducted a "democratic general inspection." After the comrades conducted a detailed inspection of him, they only provided one suggestion for improvement in work, asking him to better improve his work ability. But they put forward a long list of his advantages: consistently serious, hardworking, thorough in work, upright in ideological style, hardworking in life, loving soldiers and the people... Therefore, he was immediately assessed as deserving a second-class merit and became a learning banner for the entire military region's logistics department. In order to take care of his health, the Party had intended to transfer him to work in rear agencies several times; but the comrades were reluctant to let him leave.
    Since Zheng Wenyou was transferred to the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau as the Traffic Detachment Leader in January 1950, he has consistently maintained a hardworking and simple style, wholeheartedly treating his work, and never considering personal treatment or enjoyment. Some comrades once asked him, "Now that the conditions are better, why do you still live as hard as you did in the past?" He replied, "We Communists should always maintain a hardworking and simple style. If we forget the past after entering the city and our thinking changes, and we covet enjoyment, this is the most dangerous thing!"
    Zheng Wenyou is also very active in learning. Whenever he has free time, he always tirelessly reads books and newspapers. The comrades said, "Detachment Leader Zheng is a model in work, and also a role model for us in learning."
    Zheng Wenyou is from Changtai County, Fujian Province. He joined the army in 1933 and joined the Communist Party of China in 1937. Now he still clearly remembers: when he was a child, his father did odd jobs for the landlord's family, and his mother picked firewood all day and did some needlework for others, earning a few coins to buy some rice to cook thin porridge. When he was twelve years old, he was still scantily clad. In order to have clothes to wear and food to eat, for the next twenty years, he lived an inhuman life under the landlord's whip. In the autumn of 1933, Zheng Wenyou finally saw the sun—the Red Army came to his hometown, bringing hope to the people and pointing out a bright future. Zheng Wenyou joined this people's army at that time.
    Although Zheng Wenyou has won the titles of work model, labor model, people's hero, etc. several times, he is not complacent at all. He often says to people, "The Party has cultivated and educated me for a full twenty years, and my contribution to the Party is still too small. I must study hard, train myself, and work better for the Party and serve the broad masses of the people!"

    刻苦朴素，二十年如一日
    ——记共产党员郑文友同志的模范事迹
    孙荩民
    共产党员郑文友，今年五十五岁了。从他参加革命到现在，二十年来，不论在农村，在城市，始终保持着刻苦朴素的作风，勤奋地工作着。
    二十年的斗争生活中，由于他全心全意地为党、为人民的革命事业而奋斗，因而在南下前，曾四次被评为工作模范、劳动模范，又荣膺了二级人民英雄的光荣称号。一九四九年，在中国人民解放军×兵团××军的群英会上，他光荣地被评选为一级人民英雄，同时荣膺了模范共产党员的光荣称号。现在，他担任杭州市人民政府公安局交通大队长，又两次立了一等功。
    郑文友从一九三三年参加红四军以来，经历了无数次的战斗，先后负伤五次。一九三六年在甘肃攻取古浪城的战役中，他带伤和敌人作战，不下火线，由于战斗激烈，他昏了过去。等他醒来的时候，队伍已经撤走了，他忍着臂和腿的伤痛，爬出古浪城，爬过一条结冰的大河，整整爬了两天一夜，才找到人家。几个月之后，他终于追寻到自己的队伍。
    郑文友在战斗中表现得英勇顽强，在平常的生活作风和工作作风上，则是一贯廉洁奉公、刻苦朴素的。一九三七年他调任上士司务长，为了节省人力，他总是自己挑着担子去买菜。有一次，他到鲁中工商局去买钢笔、牙刷，回来一算，发现工商局的同志打错了算盘，少收了二千元，他就马上把钱送去。他说：“我如果贪小便宜，就对不起党和人民的培养，就会丧失一个革命工作者的优良品质。”他在鲁中军区卫生部三所任管理员时，不但经常不避艰苦地长途跋涉，翻山越岭去买价格较低的菜蔬，并且积极地组织生产，一年当中就为公家节约了六百多万元（北海币）。大家都说：“郑文友从上士司务长升到管理员，七年来钞票千千万万从他手里经过，他从来眼不花，心不动，没有贪污、浪费过公家一分钱！”有一次，卫生部三所所长想把伙食搞得更好些，向他说：“你放手把伙食好好搞一下吧，出了问题我负责！”意思是叫他把生产资金拿来改善生活。但郑文友拒绝了，他说：“拿公家的资金来改善自己的生活，是盗窃公家财富的行为。现在国家经济情况还很困难，人民的生活也很困苦，我们只要能保持一定的生活水平就行了！”在越来越艰苦的战争岁月里，公家的经济情况曾经一度发生困难，郑文友在征得领导方面和同志们的同意之后，把六百多万元（北海币）的生产资金缴公。事后，那位所长惭愧地说：“郑文友同志教育了我，使我划清了公私界限，认识了节俭的意义和作用。我要学习他的高贵的共产党员的品质！”郑文友一方面时时注意为公家节约财力、物力，一方面精打细算，尽量设法改善同志们的生活，供给伤病员有营养的食物，尽快地使他们早日恢复健康。当时，鲁中军区“前卫报”经常表扬他，他被大家公认为劳动模范。
    在长期艰苦的战斗和工作中，他流血、生病，影响了身体的健康。上级照顾他年老体弱，发给他老年金、津贴费；但他认为自己的身体还能支持工作，因此常用这些钱给伤病员买吃的东西。他领到的新衣服也经常送给伤病员穿，而自己则穿旧的。他穿的鞋，都是破了又补，补钉加补钉。
    一九四七年部队进行“民主大检查”，同志们对他进行了详细的检查之后，只在改进工作方面提供了一条意见，要他更好地提高工作能力。而对他的优点则提出了一大串：工作一贯认真、刻苦、深入、思想作风正派、生活刻苦、爱兵爱民……。因此，他当场被评为应立二等功，成为整个军区后勤部门的学习旗帜。党为了照顾他的身体，曾几次打算把他调到后方机关工作；但同志们都舍不得让他调走。
    郑文友从一九五○年一月，调任杭州市公安局交通大队长，仍然一贯保持着刻苦朴素的作风，全心全意地对待工作，从不考虑个人的待遇、享受等问题。曾经有同志问他：“现在条件比较好了，你的生活为什么还要像过去那样艰苦？”他回答说：“我们共产党人应该永远保持刻苦朴素的作风。假如进入城市以后就忘记了过去，思想上发生了变化，贪图享受，这是最危险的事！”
    郑文友在学习上也是十分积极的，只要有闲暇的时候，他总是孜孜不倦地看书、看报。同志们说：“郑大队长在工作上是模范，在学习上也是我们的表率。”
    郑文友是福建长泰县人，一九三三年入伍，一九三七年参加中国共产党。现在他还清楚地记得：小时候，父亲给地主家做零活，母亲成天拾柴、替人作些针线活，赚几个钱来买点米熬稀粥喝。他在十二岁那年，还是衣不蔽体。为了穿衣吃饭，以后整整的二十年，他都是在地主的鞭子下过着非人的生活。一九三三年的秋天，郑文友才看到了太阳——红军到了他的家乡，给人们带来了希望，指出了光明的远景。郑文友就在当时参加了这支人民的队伍。
    郑文友虽然几次荣获工作模范、劳动模范、人民英雄……的称号，但他一点不自满，他常对人说：“党培养教育我整整二十年了，我对党的贡献还太小，我一定要努力学习，锻炼自己，更好地为党工作，为广大人民服务！”
