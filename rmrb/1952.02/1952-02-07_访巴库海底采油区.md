    Visiting the Baku Offshore Oilfield
    Cao Jinghua

    At noon on November 25th, we boarded a special plane and left the heroic city of Stalingrad, named after the respected standard-bearer of world peace, Stalin, in dense fog, heading straight for Baku. After the plane took off, the pointer of the altimeter embedded above the cockpit door stubbornly and unhesitatingly climbed upward, stopping at 3,600 meters. At this time, I gazed out of the window, above was the azure sky and dazzling sunlight, below was an infinitely thick, cotton-like, snow-white, and soft layer of clouds. When approaching Astrakhan, the cloud layer below disappeared. But because the plane was still flying at an altitude of 3,500 to 3,600 meters, the ground below appeared as a vast expanse of blue. However, upon closer inspection, the forests and rivers on the ground could be faintly distinguished. After passing Astrakhan, we gradually flew lower along the west coast of the Caspian Sea. Before reaching Baku, from the plane, we could see from afar, at the end of the horizon, the black, towering oil derricks, resembling the great Siberian forests. The plane slowed down, skimmed over the forest-like oil derricks, and landed at Baku Airport.

    Baku is the capital of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the Soviet Union's important industrial and cultural centers with a population of one million, located on the west coast of the Caspian Sea, at the southern end of the Absheron Peninsula, and is a world-famous oil depot.

    After disembarking, we were greeted by Azerbaijani Stalin Prize-winning writers Lagmu, Rustamu, and other writers and artists into the city. Along the way were oil derricks, oil depots, oil refineries, and newly built tall and spacious residences for oil workers. The weather here is as warm as spring, chrysanthemums are in full bloom, and oleanders are everywhere. The diet and all aspects of life have a strong oriental flavor.

    On the 26th, after visiting the Stalin Museum and the Oil Industry Cultural Palace, on the 27th, we went to see the main object we wanted to see—the Baku oil field. The host first selected the representative Artem Island offshore oil extraction for us.

    Artem Island is a district of Baku, located northeast of Baku, about fifty kilometers from the city. It was originally separated from the mainland, but later a section of shallow sea close to the mainland was filled in artificially, forming a highway, and cars can reach it directly. In reality, it is now a peninsula. The entire island is an oil field, and the residents are all oil workers. On the island are rows of neat oil worker residences. New trees are planted everywhere.

    We took a car first to the district committee and were received by Comrade Pannakhov, the secretary of the district committee. He was originally a petroleum engineer and is now doing Party work. He accompanied us to visit the offshore oil extraction project. From the district committee to the offshore well is another eighteen kilometers. A wide bridge is erected from the island, directly to the location of the offshore well. We arrived there by car. Along the way, we did not feel like we were driving on a bridge at all; it was more like a solid and wide offshore highway. On both sides were rows of steel-framed offshore oil derricks. On both sides of this main road, there were also many offshore branch roads connecting the derrick groups.

    After we arrived, as soon as we got out of the car, it felt like we were standing in a square; in reality, we were standing on the vast sea. This is the area with the largest scale, the newest equipment, and the most concentrated offshore oil extraction. There are countless new wells being drilled here. The Soviet Union is now not only drilling straight wells, but also curved wells. That is to say, if drilling down and the oil spring is located beside the drilling well, either to the left or right, or front or back, curved wells can be drilled in the center of the earth to reach the oil spring, without abandoning previous efforts and drilling a new well. This is an astonishing achievement in drilling technology.

    After Comrade Pannakhov carefully explained the drill bit and drilling machine to me according to the actual objects, he started the drilling machine. With a loud roar, a large stream of mud gushed out from the center of the earth and flowed away along the water channel. The drill bit is a rotating hook-shaped steel tooth, and any hard stratum will be gnawed away by this steel tooth.

    The sea surface is filled with oil derricks like a forest, stretching as far as the eye can see. Generally, oil derricks stand in the sea, with no bridge to pass through. Drilling, oil extraction, etc., are completely mechanized and electrified. Even exploring oil springs is done with electrical equipment.

    Except for the new well drilling project, there are almost no workers on the oil field. Only the pumping units of each oil derrick, like nodding beetles, are rhythmically nodding day and night. The steel head of the pumping unit moves bit by bit, and the pump extracts oil from the center of the earth, sending it through oil pipelines to oil depots, and then from oil depots to oil refineries, where it is refined and distributed to various places.

    No one is seen near the oil derrick, and no management is required. Everywhere, the steel nodding beetles are honestly and tirelessly nodding rhythmically day and night. The person managing the oil derrick is safely located in the distant workshop, watching the buttons and various meters. If the oil derrick encounters a malfunction, it can be detected by the testing equipment, and a motorboat is sent to repair it. Each person can manage ten oil derricks. The oil pipelines and other equipment are carefully arranged, and not a drop of the extracted oil is allowed to be lost along the way.

    After the visit, we returned to the island and took a boat tour of the sea. The steamboat shuttled back and forth between the offshore oil derricks. In the densest area of oil derricks, several derricks are connected, and convenient bridges are built for passage.

    The transportation of Baku oil mainly follows two routes: northward, it is transported through the Caspian Sea via Astrakhan, along the Volga River to various parts of the Soviet Union; westward, it is transported through a pipeline or railway of more than 500 kilometers to Batumi, an important town on the east coast of the Black Sea, and then from Batumi to Ukraine or abroad. The airplanes in the sky, the iron horses (tractors) in the farmland, the great communist construction projects being carried out tensely throughout the country, and the operation of countless machines cannot do without the nourishment of oil from here. If Moscow is the heart of communist construction, then Baku's oil is the blood of this heart. This is also the reason why Lenin and Stalin have always attached importance to Baku, considering it one of the centers of socialist heavy industry and one of the socialist industrial bases. In the era of the Patriotic War, it nourished the front and rear, and Stalin called it one of the powerful arsenals of the Soviet armed forces. After the war, in Stalin's new five-year plan, it bears even more important tasks in communist construction.

    In the vast twilight, we left Artem Island and returned to our residence. Comrade Zhafa'er, a critic from Azerbaijan who was responsible for receiving us, at the dinner, with the Azerbaijani nation's enthusiastic and hospitable tradition, constantly raised his glass and toasted to Stalin, Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, Sino-Soviet friendship, the connection between Sino-Soviet literature and art, etc., and was still continuing to find reasons to toast the guests. Furthermore, he had learned the word "Cheers!" on the first day. His heart, full of the joy of life, found another reason to toast. He said, there is such a story: someone went to a city and passed a cemetery outside the city. He walked around there and was surprised to see the years engraved on the tombstones were so short. After entering the city, he asked his friend, do you have a special children's cemetery here? Otherwise, how could the years on the tombstones be so short? His friend said, that is not a children's cemetery. We have a tradition of engraving tombstones here: no matter how old someone lives, if he has nothing to commemorate in his life, then not even a day is engraved. What is engraved on those tombstones is not the year of birth and death, but the most happy, most joyful, most meaningful, and most memorable period of his life. Usually people write such a period in their diary, and we here solemnly engrave it on the tombstone... Dear comrades, Chinese comrades who are geographically far from us, but spiritually and emotionally close to us, your visit to Baku is the happiest, most pleasant, and most memorable moment of our lives. Let's drink to this most memorable moment!

    After the toast, Comrade Zhafa'er, with a kind smile, looked at me with his sharp black eyes and said: Comrade Cao, what is your impression of the Baku offshore oil extraction you saw today?

    I replied:

    "...Baku's offshore oil extraction, this is one of the astonishing achievements of Soviet peaceful construction, a blood bank that tirelessly transfuses blood to defend world peace and communist construction, a magnificent poem created by the Baku working class under the leadership of Stalin that overwhelms all masterpieces in the history of world literature, it is full of the richest content to defend world peace and the victory of communism, I raise my glass and drink to this magnificent poem created by the Baku working class!"

    访巴库海底采油区
    曹靖华
    十一月二十五日的正午，我们乘了一架专机，在浓雾中离开了我们所景仰的以捍卫世界和平的旗手斯大林的英名所命名的英雄城市——斯大林格勒，直向巴库飞去。飞机凌空后，驾驶室门额上所嵌的高度表的指针，倔强的，毫不踌躇的向上爬着，一直爬到三千六百公尺的时候就停住了。这时我凭窗远眺，上边是蔚蓝的天空，眩目的阳光，下边是无限厚的，一团团的棉絮似的，雪白而柔和的云层。快到阿斯特拉罕的时候，下边的云层没有了。但因还在三千五六百公尺的高空飞行，所以下边成了一片苍茫的青空，但定睛细看时，隐约的可以辨出地面上的森林，河流。过了阿斯特拉罕以后，就沿着里海西岸逐渐低飞。还没到巴库的时候，从飞机上就远远的望见地平线尽处好像西伯利亚大密林似的黑压压的高耸的油塔。飞机减低了速度，掠过了密林似的油塔，在巴库机场降落了。
    巴库是阿塞拜疆社会主义共和国的首都，是拥有百万人口的苏联重要工业和文化中心之一，在里海西岸，在亚普舍伦半岛的南端，是名闻世界的油库。
    下机后，由阿塞拜疆的得斯大林奖金的作家拉格牟，鲁斯达牟及其他作家和艺术家迎入城内。沿途都是油塔，油库，油厂以及新建成的高大宽敞的石油工人住宅。此地温暖如春，菊花盛开，到处都有夹竹桃。饮食等一切生活，都带着浓厚的东方风味。
    二十六日我们参观了斯大林博物馆，石油工业文化宫之后，二十七日就去看我们所要看的主要对象——巴库油田。主人先替我们选定了有代表性的阿尔蕉牟岛的海底采油。
    阿尔蕉牟岛是巴库一个区，在巴库东北，距城约五十公里。原与陆地隔离，后用人工将与陆地接近之一段浅海填平，成一公路，汽车直达，实际现在成了半岛。岛上全为油田，居民也全是石油工人。岛上是一排排的整洁的油工住宅。到处都有新栽的小树。
    我们乘汽车先到区委会，由区委书记潘纳霍夫同志招待。他原是一位石油工程师，现做党的工作。他陪着我们去参观海底采油工程。由区委到海井还有十八公里。由岛上架一道宽大的长桥，一直通到海井的地方。我们乘汽车到了那儿，沿途毫不觉得是在桥上行驶，这俨然是一条坚固宽阔的海上公路。两旁林立着钢架的海上油塔。这干路两侧，尚有不少海上支路，联系塔群。
    我们到后，一下车，就像置身在广场上似的，实际上，脚下却是波涛壮阔的大海。这是海底采油规模最大，设备最新，而且是最集中的地方。这儿有无数新井，正在钻探。苏联现在不但钻探直井，而且可以钻探曲井，也就是说，如果钻探下去，而油泉偏处在钻井之旁，或左或右，或前或后，都可以在地心钻曲井以通油泉，不必前功尽弃，另钻新井。这是钻井技术上一个惊人成就。
    潘纳霍夫同志将钻头，钻机等按照实物给我仔细讲了之后，就开动钻机，哗啦啦的一阵响声，很大一股泥水，呼呼的从地心涌出来，顺着水槽流去了。钻头是转动的钩形的钢齿，任何坚硬的地层，都会被这钢齿啃去。
    海面油塔如林，一望无际。一般油塔，耸立海中，无桥可通。钻井，采油等，完全机械化，电气化。甚至测探油泉，也用电气设备。
    油田上除钻新井工程外，几乎不见工人。只见每座油塔的抽油机，好像磕头虫似的，有节奏的日夜不息的磕着头。抽油机的钢头一点一点的动作，就用唧筒把石油从地心里抽出来，由输油管送到油库，再由油库送至炼油厂，提炼后，分送各地。
    油塔跟前不见一人，也不用管理。遍地钢的磕头虫，老老实实的，日夜不倦的有节奏的磕着头。管理油塔的人，安然处在老远的工务室内，看管电钮及各种表。油塔如遇故障，即可由测验设备看出来，乘汽艇前往修整。每人可管理十座油塔。油管等设备周密，抽出之油，一滴也不让中途遗漏。
    参观后，回到岛上，乘轮游海，汽轮在海上油塔间往来如穿梭。油塔最密处，数塔联系，架便桥通行。
    巴库石油的输送，主要者有两条路线：向北由里海经阿斯特拉罕，沿沃瓦河转送苏联各地，向西用长达五百余公里之油管或铁路，输送至黑海东岸重镇——巴统，再由巴统输送至乌克兰或国外。天空的飞机，农田的铁马（拖拉机），全国各地所紧张进行的伟大共产主义建设的工程以及无数机器的开动，都离不了这儿的石油的滋养。如果说莫斯科是共产主义建设的心脏，那么，巴库的石油就是这心脏的血液。这也就是列宁斯大林历来重视巴库，认为它是社会主义重工业的中心之一，是社会主义工业基地之一的原因。它在卫国战争时代，滋养了前后方，斯大林称它是苏联武装力量的强大兵工厂之一。战后在斯大林新五年计划中，在共产主义建设中，它负着更重要的任务。
    苍茫的暮色中，离开了阿尔蕉牟岛，回到寓所。阿塞拜疆的批评家，负责招待我们的查法尔同志，在晚宴上，以阿塞拜疆民族所具有的热情而爱客的传统，不断的举起杯来，为斯大林，毛泽东，中国共产党，中国人民解放军，中国人民志愿军，中苏友谊，中苏文艺的联系等等干杯之后，还在继续找理由向客人敬酒，干杯。并且他头一天就学到“干杯”这个字。他充满着生之欢乐的心情，又找到干杯的理由了。他说，有这么一个故事：某人到一个城里去，在城外经过一个坟院。他到那儿走了一遍，看见那些墓碑就奇怪起来：为什么这儿所刻的岁月都这样短？进城之后，就问他的朋友说，你们这儿还有专设的儿童公墓？否则，那碑上的岁月都怎么那样短？他朋友说，那不是儿童公墓。我们这儿刻墓碑都有一个惯例：就是无论谁活得多么大，假如他一生没有一点可纪念的，那就连一天也不刻。那些墓碑上所刻的并不是那人生卒的年月，而是他生平最幸福，最快乐，最有意义，最值得纪念的那一段。通常人们都把这样的一段写到自己的日记上，我们这里而且郑重的刻到墓碑上……亲爱的同志们，在地理上距我们很远，而在精神上和情感上距我们很近的中国的同志们，你们来到巴库的期间是我们生平最幸福，最愉快，最值得纪念的时刻。为这最值得纪念的时刻而干杯吧！
    干杯之后，查法尔同志含着亲切的微笑，用那明锐的黑眼睛望着我说：曹同志，今天看的巴库海底采油对你的印象如何？
    我回答道：
    “……巴库的海底采油，这是苏联和平建设的惊人成就之一，是保卫世界和平与共产主义建设的用之不竭的输血的血库，是巴库工人阶级在斯大林领导下所创造的压倒世界文学史上一切杰作的雄伟无比的诗篇，它充满着保卫世界和平与共产主义胜利的最丰富的内容，我举杯为巴库工人阶级所创造的这一雄伟无比的诗篇而干杯！”
