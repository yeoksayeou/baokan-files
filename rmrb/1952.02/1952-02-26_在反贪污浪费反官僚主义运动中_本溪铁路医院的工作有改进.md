    Improvements in the Work of Benxi Railway Hospital During the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign

    To the Editor: Before the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, many staff members of Benxi Railway Hospital were irresponsible towards patients, and patients were very dissatisfied with this situation. Since the launch of this campaign, the staff of Benxi Railway Hospital have made great improvements in their work style. Patient Zhang Zhongzheng's urinary catheter was blocked, and he was unable to urinate for three days, causing him extreme pain. All the people he came into contact with were female nurses, and he was afraid to reveal his condition. Nurse Director Qiu Zhongling noticed that Zhang Zhongzheng looked unusual and immediately personally examined his condition, determining that there was accumulated urine in his abdomen; however, Zhang Zhongzheng still did not admit it. Comrade Qiu Zhongling displayed the "healing the wounded and rescuing the dying" spirit that medical workers should have, and painstakingly persuaded him. Finally, Zhang Zhongzheng revealed his true condition. Comrade Qiu Zhongling immediately performed surgery, using a urinary catheter to drain 180 cc of urine, immediately reducing the patient's suffering. In addition, there was an elderly injured and sick patient who was seventy years old, unconscious, unable to move, and involuntarily urinating and defecating in bed. A young female orderly patiently wiped away his urine and feces every day. The injured and sick patients were deeply moved by her responsible spirit. Everyone said, "Benxi Railway Hospital has changed."

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中
    本溪铁路医院的工作有改进
    编辑同志：在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以前，本溪铁路医院许多工作人员对病人不负责任，病员对这种情况非常不满。自从这个运动展开以来，本溪铁路医院的工作人员，在工作作风上都有了很大的改进。病员张中正同志尿管闭塞，三天拉不出小便，苦痛异常。他所接触的都是一些女护士，他不敢把病情说出来。护士主任邱忠灵同志觉察张中正神色异样，立刻亲自检查他的病况，断定了他的腹中积尿；但是张中正仍不承认。邱忠灵同志发挥了医务工作者应有的“救死扶生”的精神，苦口婆心地说服他。最后张中正终于说出了自己的真实病况。邱忠灵同志立即施行手术，用导尿管输出了一百八十西西的尿水，使患者立刻减少痛苦。另外有一个年达七十岁的老伤病员，不省人事，身体不能动弹，尿屎都拉在床上，一位青年女卫生员便天天耐心地替他擦尿擦屎。伤病员们都深深地为她这种负责精神所感动。大家都说：“本溪铁路医院转变了。”    疗养员  刘凤纲
