On the morning of January 11th, a little girl in a student uniform and wearing a red scarf came to the Mongol Road Public Security Police Station in the First District of Tianjin. She came in and asked for the station chief, saying very seriously, "I want to report an embezzler. He stole important state equipment!" "You're here to report someone, that's great!" Comrade Zhang, the clerk at the police station, asked her to sit down, encouraging her excitedly and kindly. She calmed herself down and then said, "The embezzler is named Yang Kun, an employee of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory. He stole a box of radio vacuum tubes and two meters from military telegraph machines from the factory. These things were sold through Wu Yuzhang, an employee of the Tianjin branch of the Central Electric Company." Comrade Zhang asked her, "How did you know about this?" She replied readily, "Because they are both good friends of my father."

This little girl is named Jiang Zongxiu, only fourteen years old. She is a student at the Fourth Staff and Workers' Children's Primary School of the Tianjin Railway Administration and a member of the Chinese Young Pioneers. She is the vice chairman of the school's student union and the chairman of the sixth grade class. At the end of last semester, she ranked fourth in her class. Her teacher often praises her as a good student with excellent grades who is enthusiastic about serving everyone. Yang Kun, the embezzler reported by Jiang Zongxiu, is a good friend of her father, Jiang Gongda. Yang Kun and Jiang Gongda used to work together before liberation. Jiang Gongda changed jobs after liberation, but they still saw each other frequently.

One night in the autumn of 1950, Jiang Zongxiu overheard her father saying to her mother, "That Yang Kun is really daring! He still dares to steal two electric meters from the warehouse after liberation. These meters are from military radio transceivers." After hearing this, Jiang Zongxiu thought to herself, "How did Uncle Yang become a thief!"

Not long after, Jiang Zongxiu was helping her mother wash the dishes when Auntie Lu, a former neighbor, came to chat with her mother. Auntie Lu's husband, Lu Yinhai, works with Yang Kun. When they met, they started talking about Yang Kun. Auntie Lu said, "Haven't you seen how smug Yang Kun's wife has been lately!" The mother asked, "Has Yang Kun been promoted?" Auntie Lu said, "He's done a meritorious deed! A few days ago, the court arrested a worker from the factory who stole a box of vacuum tubes. I heard that Yang Kun discovered it, so his wife brags to everyone she meets. But can Yang Kun's past be hidden from us? In my opinion, the theft of the vacuum tubes must be related to him because he's in charge of the warehouse keys!" The mother continued, "A few days ago, Wu Yuzhang brought some vacuum tubes and secretly asked Zongxiu's father to look at them, saying that Yang Kun asked him to sell them. Maybe they are from this box!" This conversation left a deep impression in Jiang Zongxiu's mind.

On another occasion, Jiang Zongxiu went to Yang Kun's house to play with his eldest son, Yang Boyin. The Yang family was about to eat, and they repeatedly asked Jiang Zongxiu to eat with them. The food was very good, including a sugar-vinegared fish, which Jiang Zongxiu rarely ate. After the meal, she also saw a large basket of eggs and many fruits under the Yang family's bed. When Jiang Zongxiu returned home, she asked her mother, "How much money can Uncle Yang earn?" Her mother told her that Yang Kun earned more than 500 catties of millet a month, which was 200 catties less than her father. She thought, "We have two fewer people eating than their family, how come we are not richer than them?" She concluded that Yang Kun must be using money obtained by stealing things to live a comfortable life. From then on, every time she thought of "Protecting Public Property," one of the "Five Loves" taught by Chairman Mao, she thought of "Uncle Yang," who stole public property.

At the beginning of January this year, Jiang Zongxiu became a propagandist for the Henan Road neighborhood in the First District of Tianjin, and often did some activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers, as well as other propaganda activities. On January 10th, she listened to a report by the person in charge of the Tianjin First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The report mentioned that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are all our enemies. If we do not thoroughly eliminate them, it will be difficult for our country to enter a socialist society. This aroused Jiang Zongxiu's great attention. She thought of the Soviet children she had seen in picture books and movies, whose lives were so happy. She hoped that her country would be built as well as the Soviet Union as soon as possible.

That night, Jiang Zongxiu could not fall asleep. She thought of Yang Kun stealing electric meters and vacuum tubes from the factory, and felt that she should report him. She sat up excitedly. But at the same time, she also thought that her father and Yang Kun were good friends. Would her father agree to her reporting him? If Yang Kun went to court, wouldn't his family suffer? That Auntie Yang is quite fierce, what if she comes to our house and cries and makes a fuss? But she thought that she was a member of the Young Pioneers: "If I don't report him, can I live up to my red scarf? Since I want to be a good student of Chairman Mao, I must be brave and firm, and I must report him!" She finally made up her mind.

Early the next morning, she discussed this matter with her father. Her father initially stopped her, saying, "Has your Uncle Yang done anything to wrong you?" He also said, "Yang Kun is my old friend of more than ten years. He introduced me to the railway bureau. Although I have left the railway bureau now, we can't report him!" Jiang Zongxiu argued with her father. Finally, her father relented and said, "What you said is right, but you are just being 'impatient.' If he doesn't confess in two months, it won't be too late for us to report him." Seeing that her father did not agree, Jiang Zongxiu resolutely went to the police station herself to report Yang Kun's crime of theft.

Jiang Zongxiu's report was quickly forwarded to the Central Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory. The factory leadership patiently educated and mobilized Yang Kun. Yang Kun finally confessed his embezzlement and returned the two unsold electric meters to the factory.

    少年儿童队员蒋宗秀检举了贪污分子杨坤
    新华社记者  赵玉昕
    一月十一日的上午，天津市第一区蒙古路公安派出所里来了一个身穿学生服、结着红领巾的小姑娘。她进门来就找所长，态度非常严肃地说：“我要检举一个贪污犯，他偷盗了国家的重要器材！”“你是来检举的，太好啦。”派出所的文书张同志让她坐下，兴奋而亲切地鼓励着她。她定了定神，接着说：“这个贪污分子叫杨坤，是中央电工器材厂的职员，他在工厂里偷盗过一箱子收音机上的真空管和两个军用电报机上的电表。这些东西，都是托中央电器公司天津分公司的职员吴毓璋偷卖的。”张同志问她：“你怎样会知道的呢？”她爽朗地回答说：“因为他两人都是我爸爸的好朋友。”
    这位小姑娘叫蒋宗秀，今年才十四岁，是天津铁路管理局第四职工子弟小学校的学生、中国少年儿童队队员。她是该校学生会的副主席，六年级的班主席。上学期期终考试的时候，她名列全班的第四名。老师常夸奖她是一个成绩优良和热心为大家服务的好学生。蒋宗秀所检举的贪污分子杨坤，是她父亲蒋公达的好朋友。解放前杨坤和蒋公达原在一起工作。解放后蒋公达调换了工作。可是他们还经常来往。
    一九五○年秋天的一个夜里，蒋宗秀听见她爸爸对她妈妈说：“杨坤这家伙的胆子真大啊！解放以后还敢从仓库里偷两只电表出来。这种电表是军用无线电收发报机上的。”蒋宗秀听了，暗想：“怎么杨伯伯也做起贼来啦！”
    隔了不久，蒋宗秀正帮着妈妈洗碗，和她家以前做过邻居的陆大婶来找她妈妈聊天。陆大婶的丈夫陆银海和杨坤在一起工作。她们见了面便谈起杨坤来。陆大婶说：“你没见近来杨坤的老婆多么神气呀！”妈妈问：“杨坤升级了吗？”陆大婶说：“他立了功啦！前些日子法院从工厂里逮走了一个偷了一箱子真空管的工人，听说这件事是杨坤发现的，所以他老婆见了人就卖功。可是杨坤的根底还能瞒下咱们吗？依我看偷真空管的事一定和他有关系，因为他掌管着仓库的钥匙呀！”妈妈接着说：“前几天吴毓璋拿来几个真空管，偷偷摸摸地叫宗秀的爸爸看，说是杨坤托他卖的，别就是这一箱子里头的吧！”这次谈话在蒋宗秀的脑子里留下了很深的印象。
    又有一次，蒋宗秀到杨坤家里去找他的大儿子杨伯寅玩。杨家正要吃饭，再三让蒋宗秀一起吃。饭菜很好，其中有一样是蒋宗秀很少吃过的糖酥鱼。饭后，她又看到杨家的床下放着一大筐鸡蛋、许多水果。蒋宗秀回家后就问妈妈：“杨伯伯能挣多少钱啊？”她妈妈告诉她，杨坤一个月挣五百多斤小米，比她的爸爸还少二百多斤。她想：“咱们比他家少两口人吃饭，怎么还不比他家富裕呢？”她就肯定杨坤一定是拿偷盗东西得来的钱过自己的舒服日子的。从此，当她每次想到毛主席教导她们的“五爱”道德中“爱护公共财物”这一项时，她就想起偷盗公共财物的“杨伯伯”来。
    今年一月初，蒋宗秀当了天津市第一区河南路街道居民的宣传员，经常做些拥军优属和其他的宣传活动。一月十日，她听了中共天津市第一区委员会负责人关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的报告。报告中提到：贪污、浪费、官僚主义都是我们的敌人，要不彻底铲除它们，我们的国家就很难进入到社会主义社会。这一点引起了蒋宗秀很大的注意。她想到在画报上和电影里所看到的苏联的儿童，生活是那样的美满。她希望自己的国家早些建设得和苏联一样。
    这天晚上，蒋宗秀没有睡着觉，她想起杨坤偷盗工厂里的电表和真空管的事情来，觉得应该去检举他，她兴奋地坐了起来。但她同时又想到爸爸和杨坤是好朋友，爸爸会同意她检举吗？杨坤如果进了法院，他一家人不就苦了吗？那个杨伯母挺厉害，到家里来大哭大闹怎么办呢？但是，她想到她是少年儿童队员：“我不检举他能对起红领巾吗？我既然要做毛主席的好学生，就要勇敢，要坚定，一定要去检举他！”她终于下定了决心。
    第二天清早，她就和爸爸商量这件事。她爸爸起初阻拦她说：“你杨伯伯有什么对不起你的地方？”又说：“杨坤是我十几年的老朋友，你老子进铁路局就是他介绍的，现在我虽然离开了铁路局，可是咱也不能检举他呀！”蒋宗秀就和她爸爸争辩，最后，她爸爸表示让步地说：“你的话也对，可是就犯了‘急性病’，过两个月他不坦白，咱们再检举也不算晚啊。”蒋宗秀见她爸爸不同意，就坚决地自己去派出所检举了杨坤的偷盗罪行。
    蒋宗秀的检举材料很快转到了中央电工器材制造厂。该厂领导方面对杨坤进行了耐心的教育和动员，杨坤终于坦白了他的贪污事实，并且把尚未卖出的两只电表缴回了工厂。
