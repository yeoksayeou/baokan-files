Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 23rd: This reporter reports: It has been almost three months since the Korean armistice negotiations reached an agreement on the second agenda item on November 27th of last year and successively entered into discussions on the third, fourth, and fifth agenda items. During this period, thanks to our persistent efforts, all kinds of excuses used by the US side to delay and obstruct the negotiations have been eliminated one by one, and a complete agreement was within reach. However, apart from reaching a principled resolution on the fifth agenda item, the discussions on the third and fourth agenda items have been delayed due to the US side's stubborn insistence on its absurd and unreasonable demands, creating complications and obstructing the process. Therefore, the US side must bear full responsibility for the fact that the negotiations, which started in July of last year, have not yet been successfully concluded after more than seven months, and that the Korean armistice, which is eagerly awaited by peace-loving people around the world, has not yet been achieved.

As everyone knows, in line with our consistent position of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, we put forward five fair and reasonable principles when the third agenda item began to be discussed on November 27th of last year, and then put forward two supplementary suggestions on December 3rd. In order to break the deadlock created by the US side, we re-submitted a revised set of six principles on December 14th based on the above seven suggestions. These suggestions are completely fair, reasonable, and in accordance with the requirements of a true armistice agreement. However, the US side stubbornly rejected our reasonable suggestions. On the one hand, the US side stubbornly insisted on its unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and restrict our construction of airports in North Korea. On the other hand, it attempted to use the armistice under the guise of rotation and replenishment to unlimitedly strengthen the strength of its invading forces. On December 24th, in order to remove the other side's excuse and once again fully express our sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, we put forward amendments to the fourth, fifth, and sixth articles of our six-principle proposal of the 14th, which had not yet been agreed upon, and then on January 9th, we proposed an amended plan for the above three articles, agreeing within a reasonable scope to the other party's request for the necessary replacement of war equipment during the armistice. With this fair suggestion from our side, as long as the other side has the same sincerity as us, the differences between the two sides could have been completely and reasonably resolved, but the other side still insisted on its unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and restrict our construction of airports, resulting in the third agenda item still failing to reach a principled agreement. Under our solemn refutation, the US side was at a loss for words and proposed on January 25th to hold a meeting of the two sides' staff officers to discuss specific details, while leaving the so-called airport issue for later discussion.

Since the staff officers' meeting between the two sides began on January 27th, the two sides have reached a consensus on the preamble to the armistice agreement and the clauses related to the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, except that the specific locations of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone are still to be finally determined when the agreement is about to be signed. However, when entering into the detailed discussion of the specific arrangements for the ceasefire and armistice, the US side once again proposed a huge rotation limit of 75,000 people, and then made unreasonable demands on the composition, powers, and functions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, requesting our side to designate 15 locations and the other side to designate 12 locations as specific rear ports for the import of military personnel and weapons and ammunition during the armistice. In fact, after the cessation of hostilities, the entry of military personnel and weapons and ammunition into Korea should be greatly reduced, and there is absolutely no reason or need to request too many specific rear ports and import so many military personnel. Under our justified criticism, the US side was forced to make slight modifications to its absurd demands, but still stubbornly insisted on the unreasonable demands of a rotation limit of 35,000 people and six specific rear ports for each side. In order to reach an agreement quickly and remove all kinds of excuses for the US side to continue delaying and obstructing the negotiations, we have made many efforts, and finally proposed to increase the rotation limit of 5,000 people to 35,000 people, and each side should designate five rear ports. Now the US side should no longer have any excuses to delay and obstruct the agreement on the third agenda item.

However, the unreasonableness of the demands put forward by the US side in the above-mentioned discussions is very obvious. The purposes revealed by these demands are very suspicious and deserve close vigilance. On the one hand, the US side has arrogantly insisted on interfering in North Korea's internal affairs and unreasonably demanding restrictions on our construction of airports; on the other hand, it wants to import such a large number of military personnel under the guise of rotation in order to increase its aggressive military force. This approach by the US side is clearly attempting to achieve goals in the negotiations that they could not achieve in the war, restricting our construction of airports, which the US side is very afraid of, so that their air force, which is already unable to flex its muscles, can continue to do whatever it wants; it is clearly attempting to use the armistice to redeploy its military forces in order to carry out aggression again.

At the same time, on the issue of the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the US side has set up new obstacles to delay and obstruct the negotiations. We have proposed the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia as the three neutral countries that our side has invited to form the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the US side has unreasonably opposed our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral country. The US side initially could not provide any reasons for its opposition, simply saying that nominating the Soviet Union as a neutral country was "unacceptable" and that "the reasons were obvious." Under our questioning, the US side ridiculously claimed that "the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should come from countries that are not adjacent to Korea and do not have a history of involvement in the Korean issue." After our stern rebuttal, the US side resorted to rogue tactics, saying, "This is our side's unilateral reason and cannot be discussed." What other explanation can there be for the US side's unreasonable opposition, other than to show that they are deliberately delaying and obstructing the negotiations?

In the discussion of the fourth agenda item, the US side also adopted extremely shameless delaying tactics. When the Fourth Agenda Item Subcommittee began discussions on December 11th of last year, our representative put forward the fair and reasonable principle that both sides should quickly repatriate all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. Later, at the meeting on the 12th, based on the above principle, we put forward a five-point principle proposal to quickly resolve the fourth agenda item. However, from the very beginning, the US side has been playing tricks on the issue of prisoners of war, plotting to detain our captured personnel. The US side has spared no effort to create obstacles, first using the excuse that the release of prisoners should not increase the military strength of one side, and then using the excuse that it must first exchange prisoner of war materials and invite the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the prisoner of war camps as prerequisites, while refusing to discuss our reasonable suggestions. In order to eliminate all obstacles from the other side, at the meeting on December 18th, we agreed to exchange prisoner of war information and submitted complete and sufficient prisoner of war information to the other side. However, the prisoner of war information submitted by the US side was a pile of waste paper. What is especially important is that the list submitted by the US side was more than 44,000 people shorter than the list submitted by the US side through the International Committee of the Red Cross. In order to achieve its vicious purpose of detaining our captured personnel, the US side then put forward a series of absurd demands, insisting on the so-called "voluntary repatriation," "equal number exchange," civilians replacing prisoners of war, illegally classifying prisoners of war as civilians, and unilateral oaths. On February 3rd, in order to satisfy the world's people's desire for peace and remove all excuses for the other side to delay, we once again put forward a new proposal on resolving the prisoner of war issue. From February 7th, the fourth agenda item began to be discussed by the staff officers of both sides. Up to this point, thanks to our proposal on February 3rd, most of the differences between the two sides on the prisoner of war issue have been resolved, but because the US side still insists on the absurd claims of conditional release and so-called "voluntary repatriation," the fourth agenda item has still not been fully agreed upon.

From the above negotiation process, people can clearly see who is delaying and obstructing the negotiation agreement, who is sincerely seeking a true armistice in Korea; who is trying to violate the prisoners of war's desire to return home as soon as possible, and who is working hard to achieve the early return of all prisoners of war. In fact, in order to prevent our prisoners of war from returning home, the US side is massacring our prisoners of war in large numbers in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp. What is especially noteworthy is that, while deliberately delaying and obstructing the negotiations, the US side is taking the opportunity to massively increase its troops in Korea. During this period, the US side has transferred the 40th and 45th Infantry Divisions, which were originally stationed in Japan, to Korea to fight. At the same time, the US side is sending planes to increasingly frantically violate our country's northeastern airspace, carrying out various provocative activities. Not only that, but the American aggressors, in violation of human justice and international law, have continuously dispatched aircraft to drop various bacterial vermin in large quantities in the front and rear of Korea from January 28th to February 17th, frantically conducting a bacterial warfare aimed at large-scale massacre of peaceful residents of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's Army. These facts give the people of the world ample reason to raise serious questions to the US side: What ulterior motives are you constantly delaying and obstructing the negotiations for? Are you coming to negotiate a Korean armistice in order to truly achieve a Korean armistice? Or are you using the breathing space of the negotiations to prepare for a more brutal war of aggression? Now the American aggressors must answer this serious question of the people of the world with practical actions.

    新华社记者评述朝鲜停战谈判
    美方坚持荒谬无理要求应对拖延阻挠谈判负完全责任
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社记者报道：朝鲜停战谈判自从去年十一月二十七日就第二项议程达成协议并相继进入第三、第四和第五项议程的讨论以来，到现在快三个月了。在此期间，由于我方坚持不渝的努力，美方拖延阻挠谈判的各种藉口都已一个接一个地被解除，全部达成协议本已伸手可及。但双方现在除就第五项议程获致原则解决外，在第三、第四项议程的讨论中，由于美方顽固坚持其荒谬的无理要求，横生枝节，百般拖延阻挠，以致仍迟迟未能取得全部协议。因此，美方对从去年七月开始的已超过七个月的谈判至今仍未能顺利结束，以及全世界爱好和平的人们所热望着的朝鲜停战至今仍不能实现的事实，必须担负完全的责任。
    大家知道，我方本着和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张，在第三项议程于去年十一月二十七日开始讨论时，就提出了五项公平合理的原则，十二月三日又提出了两项补充建议。为了打开美方造成的僵局，我方在十二月十四日又根据上述七项建议而重新提出了修正后的六项原则。这些建议完全是公平合理和符合于一个真正停战协定的要求的。但是美方却蛮横地拒绝了我方的合理建议。美方一方面蛮横地坚持其干涉我方内政、限制我方在朝鲜境内修建机场的无理要求，另一方面又企图在轮换和补充的藉口下，利用停战来无限制地增强他们的侵略军队的实力。十二月二十四日，我方为了解除对方藉口和再次充分表示和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，又提出了我方十四日六项原则建议中尚未达成协议的第四、第五、第六条的修正案，接着又在一月九日提出上述三条的修正方案，在合理范围内同意了对方在停战期间进行必要的战争装备的替换的要求。我方这一公正的建议，只要对方具有和我方同样的诚意，双方之间的分歧本已可取得完全合理的解决，但对方却仍然坚持其干涉我方内政、限制我方修建机场的无理要求，致使第三项议程仍不能达到原则协议。在我方严正驳斥下，美方理屈词穷，便于一月二十五日提议召开双方参谋会议讨论具体细节，而将所谓机场问题留待以后讨论。
    自从双方参谋会议在一月二十七日开始讨论以来，对停战协定的序言及有关军事分界线与非军事区的条款除军事分界线及非军事区的具体位置仍有待协议即将签字时作最后确定之外，双方意见已臻一致，但美方在进入停火与休战的具体安排的细节讨论中，又提出了七万五千人的庞大的轮换限额，接着又在讨论中立国监察委员会的组成、权力和职司的问题上提出无理主张，要求我方指定十五个地点，对方指定十二个地点为特定后方口岸，作为在停战期间输入军事人员与武器弹药之用。实际上，在敌对行为终止之后，军事人员与武器弹药进入朝鲜，应该有大量的削减，决没有任何理由和必要，要求过多的后方特定口岸和输入如此众多的军事人员。在我方的据理批驳下，美方被迫虽不得不对它的荒谬要求略作修改，但仍顽固地坚持三万五千人的轮换限额和双方各六个后方特定口岸的无理主张。为了迅速达成协议，并解除美方继续拖延阻挠谈判的各种藉口，我方曾作了多次努力，最后提议把五千人的轮换限额提高为三万五千人，后方口岸双方各指定五个。现在美方应该再不能有任何拖延和阻挠第三项议程取得协议的藉口了。
    但是，在上述问题讨论中，美方所提出的要求的毫无道理是十分显然的。这些要求所暴露出来的目的是十分可疑并值得人们严加警惕的。美方一方面曾狂妄地坚持干涉朝鲜内政，无理要求限制我方修筑机场；一方面却又要在轮换的藉口下输入数目如此庞大的军事人员，以增加它们的侵略武力。美方这种做法，显然企图在谈判中获得它们在战争中所不能达到的目标，限制我方修建为美方所十分恐惧的飞机场，以便使它们已经不能逞能的空军能继续为所欲为；显然企图利用停战来重新部署军力，以便再行进行侵略。
    同时，在关于中立国监察委员会的组成问题上，美方又设置了拖延和阻挠谈判的新障碍。我方提出了苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克为我方所邀请的组成中立国监察委员会的三个中立国家。但美方竟毫无理由地反对我方提名苏联为中立国。美方开始提不出任何反对理由，只是说提名苏联为中立国是“不能接受的”，“理由是很显然的”。在我方质问下，美方即荒唐地诡称“中立国监察委员会应出自不与朝鲜邻近而且没有过去参与朝鲜问题的记录的国家”。经我方的严词驳斥，美方又耍无赖地说“这是我方单方面的理由，不能加以讨论”。美方这种毫无理由的反对，除了说明它们故意拖延和阻挠谈判以外，还能有别的解释吗？
    在讨论第四项议程中，美方也同样采取了极端无耻的拖延手段。我方代表在去年十二月十一日第四项议程小组委员会开始讨论的时候，即提出双方在停战协议签字后迅速遣送全体战俘的公平合理的原则。以后，又在十二日的会议上根据上述原则，提出了迅速解决第四项议程的五点原则建议。但是，美方从一开始就在战俘问题上玩弄诡计，阴谋扣留我方被俘人员。美方不惜千方百计地制造障碍，始则藉口释放俘虏不得增加一方的军事力量，继则藉口必须首先交换战俘的材料并邀请红十字国际委员会访问俘虏营以作为先决条件，而拒绝讨论我方的合理建议。我方为了排除对方的一切阻挠，在十二月十八日的会议上同意交换俘虏资料，并向对方提出了完整而充分的俘虏资料。而美方所提出的俘虏资料却是一堆废纸。尤其重要的是美方交来的名单中，较美方经由红十字国际委员会交来的名单竟短少了四万四千多人。美方为了达到其扣留我方被俘人员的凶恶目的，接着就提出了一系列荒谬的要求，坚持所谓“自愿遣返”、“同等数目交换”、平民顶战俘、非法地将战俘分类为平民以及片面的宣誓等主张。二月三日，我方为了满足全世界人民渴望和平的愿望和解除对方一切拖延的藉口，再次提出关于解决俘虏问题的新方案。从二月七日起，第四项议程即开始由双方参谋会议讨论。至此，由于我方二月三日的提案，双方关于俘虏问题的分歧已大部分获得解决，但由于美方仍坚持有条件的释放和所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，以致第四项议程至今仍未能全部取得协议。
    人们从以上谈判的过程中，可以清楚地看出是谁在拖延、阻挠谈判的协议，是谁在诚心诚意地谋求朝鲜的真正停战；是谁在力图违反战俘早日回家的愿望，是谁在努力求取全部战俘早日回家。事实上，美方为了阻止我方战俘回家，正在巨济岛战俘营中大量屠杀我方战俘。尤其值得注意的是，与故意拖延和阻挠谈判同时，美方却乘机大量增兵朝鲜。在这一时期，美方已把原驻日本的第四十、四十五步兵师调到朝鲜作战。同时，美方又派飞机日益疯狂地侵犯我国东北领空，进行种种挑衅活动。不仅如此，美国侵略者竟违反人类正义和国际公法，于一月二十八日到二月十七日这一期间，连续派遣飞机在朝鲜前后方大量撒放各种细菌毒虫，疯狂地进行以大规模虐杀朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民军队为目的的细菌战争。这些事实使全世界人民有充分的理由向美方提出严重的质问：你们不断拖延和阻挠谈判究竟为了什么不可告人的目的？你们来谈判朝鲜停战，是为了真正要达成朝鲜停战呢？还是利用谈判的喘息时间来准备更残酷的侵略战争呢？现在必须由美国侵略者用实际行动来回答全世界人民这个严重的问题。
