Mass Farmland Water Conservancy Work in Yuncheng Special District, Shanxi
    Liu Zongyao, Fan Jianmin

    The Yuncheng Special District is located in the southern part of Shanxi Province, with approximately 600,000 mu of paddy fields, accounting for 6.5% of the total cultivated area. Irrigation from wells and canals each accounts for half of this area. The canals are mostly small-scale, primarily utilizing mountain floods, with only 35% of the area irrigated by clear water. There are currently no large-scale canals, and future water conservancy projects on the Fen River and Hui River will only irrigate about 300,000 to 400,000 mu. Because of insufficient water sources in southern Shanxi, the prospects for canal irrigation are not very promising. However, most areas of Yuncheng Special District can utilize well irrigation. Therefore, digging wells and promoting waterwheels are the main tasks for developing farmland water conservancy in Yuncheng Special District.

    Farmers in the Yuncheng Special District have a tradition of irrigation. However, under long-term reactionary rule, farmland water conservancy has not been developed. After liberation, farmers' enthusiasm for production increased greatly, and the demand for turning dry land into paddy fields became urgent. For example, the new-style waterwheel was only introduced last year. Initially, some farmers refused to use it, and some cadres also thought it had no future. However, after a focused trial use, it immediately gained traction. Many farmers stopped the carts transporting the waterwheels, vying to borrow them, and waterwheels immediately became in short supply. In Xiwang Village, Jie County, within less than two years, 47 new-style waterwheels were added.

    Developing farmland water conservancy is a major factor in achieving agricultural abundance. Some county and district leaders pay close attention to general agricultural production work, but do not give enough importance to farmland water conservancy work. Some counties completely place farmland water conservancy work on one or two water conservancy cadres. These few water conservancy cadres then concentrate their efforts on relatively larger canal projects and resolving water disputes, and are sometimes transferred to "cooperate" with central work, so naturally there is no discussion of carrying out mass-based small-scale water conservancy work. To universally carry out mass-based small-scale farmland water conservancy, it is not enough to rely on one or two professional cadres from the county people's government to promote it. It is necessary for cadres at all levels of the county, district, and village to take on the specific organization and mobilization work in order to do this work well.

    Relying solely on the spontaneity of farmers is not enough for the development of well irrigation. In the future, agricultural leading organs in various counties must, on the one hand, mobilize farmers to dig new wells and install waterwheels, and on the other hand, find ways to expand the irrigated area of each well. Organizing collective well digging, collective borrowing of waterwheels, and collective irrigation is the correct direction for developing current well water irrigation. Otherwise, not only will the effectiveness of each well not be realized, but new wells cannot be dug in large numbers (because the cost of wells and waterwheels is relatively high, and farmers' land is dispersed). Farmers in Jie County have many good experiences in organizing joint-stock well digging. For example, Xiwang Village in the Third District is an area where artesian wells and brick wells are used in combination for irrigation. Each artesian well is divided into four to ten shares for use, and each household subscribes according to the area they plan to irrigate. The costs of artesian wells, brick wells, waterwheels, etc., are shared equally according to the number of shares. If the whole group has ten shares, then it rotates once every ten days, and those who subscribe to several shares can irrigate for several consecutive days. Of the 50 artesian wells in the whole village, only one is owned by a individual farmer; of the 59 waterwheels, only three are owned by individual farmers. Many villages that use shallow wells for irrigation also use this joint-stock method. This method is both reasonable and simple, and is well worth promoting. Some farmers are eager to dig wells, but because the neighboring households are not wealthy enough or do not get along well, they cannot organize. Therefore, it is necessary to lead farmers in the village to organize a core water conservancy institution, responsible for organizing and mobilizing well-digging households, and solving financial difficulties or land exchange problems for well-digging households.

    Reasonable irrigation methods can expand the irrigated area of each well. Farmers in Xiwang Village, because they rotate according to shares and have limited time for water use, have developed a habit of rational water use during the cotton irrigation season, and universally adopt furrow irrigation (that is, irrigating every other row according to the rows and plants of cotton). According to the experience of farmers in this village, furrow irrigation can expand the irrigation area by more than one-half, and at the same time, it has no impact on yield at all, which is a very good irrigation method for rational water use. Many farmers in cotton-growing areas who use well water for irrigation only irrigate cotton fields and not other crops. Therefore, except for the cotton irrigation season of more than one month in a year, the wells and waterwheels are left unused in the fields during the rest of the time. In villages in Jie County where joint digging and joint irrigation are relatively well-established, each well can irrigate more than 20 mu of cotton fields; if farmers can be mobilized to irrigate wheat fields and autumn crops, it is not a problem to add another 20 mu.

    The amount of land irrigated by each waterwheel is also greatly affected by animal power. Facts have proven that a waterwheel pulled by cattle can only irrigate 2.5 mu of land per day and night, while a waterwheel pulled by mules, horses, or donkeys can irrigate 3.5 to 4 mu. During the irrigation season, farmers often cannot fully utilize the wells and waterwheels because they cannot find a partner to share livestock with, so they cannot rotate livestock day and night to draw water. It can be seen that the development of well irrigation is inseparable from the development of livestock. At present, the livestock feed in Yuncheng Special District is gradually becoming insufficient. Mobilizing farmers to grow more alfalfa can not only solve the feed problem locally, but also improve the soil in cotton fields. Organizing farmers to share livestock and purchase new livestock is also very important work in developing well water irrigation.

    The combination of artesian wells and shallow wells for irrigation is the best method created by farmers in Yuncheng Special District from years of experience to solve the problem of saline water irrigation. However, because there are few technicians with low skill in digging artesian wells, failures often occur, which has hindered the development of artesian wells. Although the prospects for the development of native well-digging methods are not great, in areas where shallow wells contain heavy salt or insufficient water, using native methods to dig artesian wells or deep wells for irrigation is still the only way out for developing paddy fields at present. Now, a group of technicians who know native well-digging methods can be trained to dig wells on the existing foundation. When conditions permit, this group of technicians can switch to machine well-digging. The method of digging artesian wells in Yuncheng Special District is the same as the method of drilling wells to find springs in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces. Relevant leading organs should allocate some effort to collect, study, and improve the experience of technicians in these areas. For example, the situation of the cone wings being stuck and the cone falling off occurs most often when digging artesian wells. If a device can be designed to release the cone wings inside the cone tube, the number of well-digging failures can be greatly reduced.

    In terms of canal irrigation, the old feudal water regulations have gradually been destroyed. Wenxi County has piloted the distribution of water according to the water demand season of various crops, and Jiang County has piloted the method of rotating irrigation from beginning to end, which has made certain achievements. However, most cadres and farmers are very enthusiastic about building new small-scale canals, and have achieved greater results, but they do not pay enough attention to improving existing canals and strengthening management. Some farmers still have a strong sense of exclusive water rights. For example, Honghuayu Village in Jishan County still has an unreasonable method of graded water rotation. Democratic management institutions have not been universally established, the system of collecting water fees has not been implemented, there are few water control structures such as sluice gates, and the phenomenon of wasting water is still very serious in some places. The Yuncheng Special District Water Conservancy Conference held on November 1 last year decided that Wenxi, Anyi, Yishi, and Xiaxian would jointly establish a "Sushui River Water Conservancy Committee" to be responsible for solving the problem of water use between upstream and downstream areas, collecting water fees, improving management methods and engineering facilities, in order to expand the irrigated area. Other small-scale canals can also be gradually improved along this direction.

    Northern China is threatened by drought every year. In order to achieve agricultural abundance, in Yuncheng Special District, as in other areas of North China, it is necessary to attach importance to the development of mass farmland water conservancy, and strive to prevent drought and increase the yield per unit area.

    山西运城专区的群众性农田水利工作
    刘宗耀　范健民
    运城专区在山西省的南部，现有水田约六十万亩，占全部耕地面积百分之六点五。其中水井和河渠的灌溉面积各占一半。河渠多属小型渠道，大部分是利用山洪的，利用清水灌溉的面积仅占百分之三十五。现在还没有较大型的渠道，将来可在汾河和浍河修建水利工程，但灌溉面积也只有三四十万亩。因为晋南水源不足，河渠灌溉的前途并不太大。但是运城专区的大部地区，都可以利用水井灌溉。所以打水井和推广水车是发展运城专区农田水利的主要工作。
    运城专区一带农民是有灌溉习惯的。但是，在长期的反动统治下，农田水利一直没有发展起来。解放以后，农民的生产热情高涨，对旱田变水田的要求很迫切。如新式水车从去年才开始推广，最初有些农民拒绝使用，有些干部也认为没有发展前途；但经过重点试用后，立刻就打开了局面，很多农民拦着装运水车的大车争相贷用，水车立即供不应求。解县西王村一个村子，不到两年时间，便添置了新式水车四十七辆。
    发展农田水利是农业丰产的一个主要因素。有些县、区领导干部，很注意一般农业生产工作，但对农田水利工作却不够重视。有些县把农田水利工作完全放在一两个水利干部身上。这少数的水利干部又把力量集中在比较大些的渠道工程和解决水利纠纷方面，有时还被调去“配合”中心工作，这样当然就谈不到开展群众性的小型水利工作了。要普遍开展群众性的小型农田水利，只靠县人民政府的一两个专业干部去推动是不行的，一定要靠县、区、村各级干部把具体的组织动员工作担负起来，才能把这个工作做好。
    水井灌溉的发展，只靠农民的自发性是不够的。今后各县农业领导机关，一方面要发动农民打新井和安装水车，一方面还要设法扩大每眼水井的浇地面积。组织起来伙打井、伙贷水车、伙浇地，是发展当前井水灌溉的正确方向。否则，不但不能发挥每眼水井的效能，而且不能多打新井（因为水井水车的成本较高，农民的土地分散）。解县农民在组织起来合股打井方面有很多好的经验。如三区西王村是自流井和砖井配合灌溉的地区，每眼自流井分四股至十股使用，各户按自己准备浇地的面积入股，自流井、砖井、水车等费用都按股数均摊。如全组共有十股，则每十天轮浇一次，入几股可连浇几天。全村五十眼自流井中，只一眼是单干农民所有的；五十九辆水车中，只三辆是单干农民所有的。利用浅井灌溉的村庄，有很多村也采用这种合股的办法。这种办法既合理又简单，很值得推广。有些农民迫切要求打井，但因地邻的富力不够或性情不合，组织不起来。因此，领导农民在村里组织一个核心的水利机构，负责组织和动员打井户，替打井户解决资金困难或互换土地等问题，是很必要的。
    合理的灌溉方法，可以扩大每眼水井的浇地面积。西王村的农民，因为按股轮浇，用水的时间有限制，在浇棉季节，养成了合理用水的习惯，普遍采用隔沟浇水（就是按棉花的行株，隔一行浇一行）。根据这村农民的经验，隔沟浇水可以把灌溉面积扩大二分之一以上，同时对产量没有一点影响，是一个很好的合理用水的灌溉方法。植棉区中很多利用井水灌溉的农民，只浇棉田不浇其他作物。因此，一年之中，除了一个多月的浇棉季节外，其余时间，水井水车便搁置在田里不用。在解县伙打伙浇比较有基础的村庄，每眼水井可浇棉田二十多亩；如能动员农民灌溉麦地和秋季作物，再增浇二十亩是不成问题的。
    每辆水车浇地多少，受畜力的影响也很大。事实证明，用牛牵引的水车一昼夜只能浇二亩半地，用骡、马或驴牵引的水车可浇到三亩半到四亩。在灌溉季节，农民往往因为找不到伙用牲口的对象，不能换着牲口日夜汲水，便不能把水井水车充分利用起来。可见发展水井灌溉和发展牲畜是分不开的。目前运城专区的牲畜饲料已渐感不足，动员农民多种苜蓿，不但可就地解决饲料问题，还可以改良棉田的土壤。组织农民伙用牲口和购买新牲口，在发展井水灌溉中也是很重要的工作。
    自流井和浅水井配合灌溉，是运城专区农民从多年经验中创造出来的解决盐水灌溉问题的最好方法。但因打自流井的技工少，技术低，失败的事件常常发生，使自流井的发展遭到了阻碍。虽然土法打井的发展前途不大，但在浅水井含盐较重或水量不足的地区，利用土法打自流井或深井灌溉，在目前仍是发展水田的唯一出路。现在可以训练一批土法打井的技工，在已有的基础上进行打井；等到条件允许的时候，这批技工便可转业到机器凿井方面去。运城专区打自流井的方法，和河北、平原两省凿井下泉的方法相同，有关领导机关应该分配一部分力量，把这些地区技术工人的经验集中起来加以研究改进。例如打自流井时因锥翅被卡而落锥的情形发生最多，如果设计一种在锥管内部能使锥翅脱落的装置，打井失败的事件便可以减少很多。
    在河渠灌溉方面，旧的封建水规已渐被摧毁，闻喜县试行按照各种农作物的需水季节分配用水，绛县试行挨次轮浇一轮到底的方法，曾做出一定的成绩。但一般干部和农民，对兴修新的小型渠道热情很高，成绩也较大，对改善旧有渠道和加强管理则注意不够。在一部分农民中还有浓厚的水权特有思想，如稷山县红化峪村仍有不合理的分等轮水办法。民主管理机构还没有普遍成立，征收水费制度也没有实行，控制水量的水闸等建筑物很少，浪费用水的现象有些地方仍很严重。去年十一月一日召开的运城专区水利会议曾决定由闻喜、安邑、猗氏、夏县联合成立“涑水河水利委员会”，负责解决上下游用水问题，征收水费，改进管理方法及工程设施，以扩大浇地面积。其他小型渠道，也可以沿着这个方向逐渐改进。
    华北区每年受着旱灾的威胁，为了达到农业丰产的目的，在运城专区，和在华北其他地区一样，一定要重视发展群众性的农田水利，为防止旱灾提高单位面积产量而奋斗。
