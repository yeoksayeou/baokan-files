    West German and French Reactionary Ruling Groups
    Quarrel Fiercely Over the Saar
    US "European Army" Plan Encounters New Difficulties
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 14] As the "European Army" plan has stalled due to serious contradictions between Western European countries, and the United States is attempting to directly revive West German militarism, fierce quarrels have recently broken out between France and West Germany, the two main aggressors on the European continent, creating new difficulties for the US war preparations plan in Europe.
    The spark that ignited the quarrel between the West German and French ruling groups was: France recently took further measures to occupy the Saar, promoting its High Commissioner in the Saar region to "Ambassador" to the local government. After France did this, West German puppet Chancellor Adenauer, with US support, immediately declared on January 27 that West Germany refused to sign an agreement to provide troops for the European Army until the Saar issue was resolved. He also ordered the West German representatives attending the Paris European Army Conference on the same day to demand immediate permission for West Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On February 4, Adenauer reiterated that West Germany would not sign the European Army agreement unless these two demands were met. Adenauer openly accused French politicians of undermining so-called "European unity." The West German bourgeois newspaper "German Daily and Economic Report" even suggested that French Foreign Minister Schuman resign. This arrogant attitude of West German militarists immediately aroused strong reactions from French political figures. Schuman wrote directly to US Secretary of State Acheson, expressing France's "opposition" to West Germany joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. French bourgeois newspapers angrily denounced Adenauer. The United Press believes that such a fierce quarrel between West Germany and France will "develop into a major diplomatic crisis between Bonn and Paris."
    The quarrel that erupted between West Germany and France over the Saar issue proves that the powerful movement of the Western European people against the remilitarization of Germany has strongly hit the US plan to arm West Germany. On the West German side, the Adenauer government is currently forcing the West German parliament to pass a series of decisions to enable West Germany to participate in the North Atlantic war preparations and to implement a compulsory military service system domestically. This action by the Adenauer government to sell out the West German people to the United States as cannon fodder has aroused strong opposition from the West German people, and has also caused confusion and division within the West German ruling group. As the International News Service revealed, Adenauer "is facing the crisis of losing the support of the majority in parliament." In this situation, Adenauer took advantage of France's actions in the Saar to raise the above-mentioned demands, and wanted to use the demand for immediate permission for West Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to disguise West Germany, which has been reduced to a US colony, as an "equal" ally of the United States in the North Atlantic Group, in order to incite revanchism in West Germany to win the support of the masses. On the French side, the French reactionaries did not originally oppose West Germany joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but they were very afraid of the powerful force of the French people who opposed the arming of West Germany. The French ruling group, which has been changing cabinets every few months, cannot but consider that allowing West Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at this time would cause their political crisis to develop to an unmanageable point.
    At the same time, the quarrel between West Germany and France over the Saar also reflects that the economic contradictions between the West German and French bourgeoisie have deepened due to the US policy of arming West Germany. Currently, the Schuman Plan is completing the approval procedures in the parliaments of Western European countries. The US aims to fully control the economies of Western European countries through the Western European Coal and Steel Super Cartel established by this plan, and to use West German monopoly capitalists as its main agents. At this time, France's measures to further occupy the Saar obviously aimed to maintain a more favorable position in the upcoming Western European Coal and Steel Super Cartel. The US and West German monopoly capitalists want to seize control of the Saar in order to ensure an absolute dominant position in the Western European Coal and Steel Super Cartel.
    The fierce quarrel between West Germany and France, reflecting these multiple contradictions, has directly hit the US plan to establish a European Army to accelerate the arming of West Germany, adding another difficulty to the already half-dead European Army negotiations. United Press Bonn, January 28, revealed that a senior Western diplomat worriedly said: The dispute between West Germany and France
    "May seriously delay the entire European Army plan and the rearmament of West Germany." International News Service Paris, February 5, also revealed:
    "Diplomats in Paris fear a serious Franco-German crisis, which could delay the conclusion of the European Army agreement and delay General Eisenhower's Atlantic Treaty defense plan." US officials are even more afraid that this "delay" will have very serious consequences. United Press Washington, February 5, said that US officials "fear that prolonged delays will endanger the entire plan (of the US to expand its military in Western Europe) and will seriously frustrate the European defense plan."

### 西德和法国反动统治集团  为争夺萨尔大吵大闹  美国“欧洲军”计划遭遇新的困难

    西德和法国反动统治集团
    为争夺萨尔大吵大闹
    美国“欧洲军”计划遭遇新的困难
    【新华社十四日讯】在“欧洲军”计划已因西欧各国间的严重矛盾而陷于停顿，美国正在企图直接复活西德军国主义的情形下，作为西欧大陆上的两大侵略主力的法国与西德之间，最近发生了激烈的争吵，给美国在欧洲的备战计划造成了新的困难。
    西德与法国统治集团间发生争吵的导火线是：法国在最近采取了进一步霸占萨尔的措施，把它驻萨尔地区的高级专员提升为驻当地政府的“大使”。在法国这样做了以后，西德傀儡总理阿登纳马上就在美国支持下于一月二十七日宣称：在萨尔问题未解决以前，西德拒绝签订对欧洲军提供军队的协定。他还命令西德出席巴黎欧洲军会议的代表在同一天提出立即准许西德参加北大西洋公约的要求。二月四日，阿登纳又再度声称：除非西德这两项要求得到满足，西德就不签订欧洲军协定。阿登纳公开斥责法国政客们破坏所谓“欧洲的统一”。西德资产阶级报纸“德意志日报与经济报”甚至建议法国外交部长舒曼辞职。西德军国主义分子这种蛮横的态度立刻引起了法国政界人士激动的反应。舒曼直接写信给美国国务卿艾奇逊，表示法国“反对”西德加入北大西洋公约。法国资产阶级报纸纷纷怒骂阿登纳。合众社认为：西德与法国之间这样激烈的争吵，将“发展为波恩和巴黎间重大的外交危机”。
    西德和法国之间在萨尔问题上爆发出来的这次争吵证明：西欧人民声势浩大的反对德国重新军国主义化运动，已有力地打击了美国武装西德的计划。在西德方面，阿登纳政府目前正在逼迫西德议会通过使西德参加北大西洋备战工作，以及在国内实施强迫兵役制等一连串的决定。阿登纳政府这种把西德人民出卖给美国充当炮灰的行动，已激起了西德人民强烈的反对，也引起了西德统治集团内部的混乱与分歧。如国际新闻社所透露：阿登纳“已面临着丧失议会多数支持的危机”。在这种情况下，阿登纳才乘法国对萨尔采取行动的时机提出上述要求，并想用立即准许西德加入北大西洋公约的要求，来把已沦为美国殖民地的西德伪装成北大西洋集团中美国的“平等”盟国，以此在西德煽动复仇主义来骗取群众的支持。而在法国方面，法国反动派本来也并不反对西德加入北大西洋公约，但是他们却十分害怕反对武装西德的法国人民的强大力量。已经是每隔几个月就要换一次内阁的法国统治集团不能不考虑到目前让西德加入北大西洋公约，会使他们的政治危机发展至不可收拾的地步。
    同时，西德与法国间对于萨尔的争吵，也反映出西德与法国资产阶级之间的经济矛盾已因美国武装西德的政策而加深。目前，舒曼计划正在西欧各国议会完成批准手续，美国的目的是要通过这个计划所成立的西欧煤钢超级卡特尔来完全控制西欧各国的经济，并把西德垄断资本家作为它的主要代理人。正在这个时候，法国采取进一步霸占萨尔的措施，显然想在行将成立的西欧煤钢超级卡特尔中，多少维持一个比较有利的地位。而美国和西德的垄断资本家则要夺取对萨尔的控制权，以便在西欧煤钢超级卡特尔中确保绝对统治的地位。
    反映出这重重矛盾的西德与法国之间的激烈争吵，已经直接打击了美国成立欧洲军以加速武装西德的计划，使已经半死不活的欧洲军谈判又增加了一个难题。合众社波恩一月二十八日电透露，一个西方高级外交人员忧虑地说：西德与法国的争执
    “可能严重地拖延整个欧洲军计划与西德重整军备的进行”。国际新闻社巴黎二月五日电也透露：
    “在巴黎的外交人员害怕发生严重的法德危机，这种严重的危机，可能延误欧洲军协定的缔结，延缓艾森豪威尔将军的大西洋公约防务计划的进行。”美国官员更害怕这种“拖延”会产生十分严重的后果。合众社华盛顿五日电说，美国官员“深恐长期拖延会使（美国在西欧扩军的）全部计划受到危险，并且会使欧洲防务计划受到严重挫折。”
