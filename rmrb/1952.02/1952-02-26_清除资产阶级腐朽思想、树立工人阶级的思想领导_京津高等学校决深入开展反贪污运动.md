Eliminate the Decadent Ideologies of the Bourgeoisie and Establish the Ideological Leadership of the Working Class
Universities and Colleges in Beijing and Tianjin Determined to Deepen the Anti-Corruption Movement

The Beijing Higher Education Institutions Thrift Inspection Committee and the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Institutions Teachers' Study Committee convened an enlarged joint meeting of the heads of the subordinate sixteen higher education institutions on the 15th, to discuss and decide on the issue of deepening the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing-Tianjin higher education institutions.

Vice Minister Qian Junrui spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the main task of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in higher education institutions is to resolutely oppose bourgeois ideology and establish the ideological leadership of the working class within the schools. Although the administrative and teaching work of higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin has been continuously reformed under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the bourgeois ideology still occupies a leading position in many school departments and faculties based on the specific situation. The various resistances encountered in the work of departmental and faculty adjustments, curriculum reforms, etc., powerfully illustrate this point. In this movement, higher education institutions must not only thoroughly eradicate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but more importantly, they must boldly mobilize the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism among teachers to achieve ideological transformation and educational reform. On behalf of the Ministry of Education, Vice Minister Qian Junrui announced that, based on the opinions of various schools and approved by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, the start date for the new semester in higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin would be postponed to March 1st. Students who have already returned to school should be organized to participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to receive ideological education. After the start of the semester, each school can continue to thoroughly implement the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in different ways, depending on the specific circumstances.

The meeting listened to reports from the heads of the thrift inspection committees of sixteen higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin regarding the progress of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in their respective schools and held discussions.

Finally, Li Leguang, Deputy Director of the Beijing Higher Education Institutions Thrift Inspection Committee, made specific arrangements for the further development of the movement. He said: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in higher education institutions must revolve around exposing and criticizing bourgeois ideology. In terms of anti-corruption: we must organize a capable "tiger-fighting team," learn from experience, abide by discipline, and besiege major corrupt elements based on policies and specific circumstances. In terms of anti-waste: an anti-waste exhibition for all higher education institutions in Beijing is currently being prepared, and visits and discussions will be organized to further strengthen the ideological education of teachers, students, and staff on cherishing national property. In terms of anti-bureaucracy and criticizing bourgeois ideology, everyone is called upon to "take a bath," but different methods should be adopted based on different ideologies and work styles (such as holding department student-teacher meetings, medium-sized meetings, college meetings, or school-wide meetings, etc.) to seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism, and eliminate the corrupt bourgeois ideology existing in higher education institutions. In terms of organizational leadership, each school must rely on the masses, concentrate its forces, focus on key links, and thoroughly implement the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    清除资产阶级腐朽思想、树立工人阶级的思想领导
    京津高等学校决深入开展反贪污运动
    北京高等学校节约检查委员会和京津高等学校教师学习委员会，于十五日召集所属十六个高等学校的分会负责人，举行扩大联席会议，讨论并决定京津高等学校深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动问题。
    钱俊瑞副部长在会上讲话，他指出：高等学校的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，主要任务是在学校中坚决反对资产阶级思想，树立工人阶级的思想领导。京津两市高等学校的行政和教学工作，虽然在中央人民政府的领导下不断加以改造，但是从具体情况来看，在不少学校的院、系中资产阶级思想还是居于领导地位。院系调整、课程改革等工作中遇到了种种的抵抗，都有力地说明了这一点。在这次运动中，高等学校不但要彻底铲除贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，而更重要的，必须放手发动群众，在教师中开展批评和自我批评，以达到思想改造，改革教育的目的。钱俊瑞副部长代表教育部宣布：根据各校的意见，并经政务院周恩来总理批准，京津两市高等学校开学日期，决定推延到三月一日。已归校的同学，应组织其参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以使受到思想教育。开学以后，各校可根据具体情况，采取不同方式，继续把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动贯彻进行到底。
    会议听取了京津十六个高等学校节约检查委员会负责人关于各校进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的汇报，并做了讨论。
    最后，由北京高等学校节约检查委员会副主任委员李乐光对今后运动的深入开展，作了具体布置。他说：高等学校的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，必须围绕揭露和批判资产阶级思想来进行。在反贪污方面：要组织精悍的“打虎队”，学习经验，遵守纪律，根据政策和具体情况，围攻大贪污分子。反浪费方面：现正筹备举行全北京市高等学校反浪费展览会，组织参观和讨论，对师生员工进一步加强爱护国家资财的思想教育。在反官僚主义和批判资产阶级思想方面，号召大家来“洗澡”，但要根据不同的思想和作风，采取不同方式（如召开系师生会、中型会、院会或全校大会等），严肃地展开批评和自我批评，把高等学校中存在着的资产阶级腐化思想加以清除。在组织领导方面，各校要依靠群众，要集中力量，抓紧主要环节，要有计划地有步骤地把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动贯彻到底。
