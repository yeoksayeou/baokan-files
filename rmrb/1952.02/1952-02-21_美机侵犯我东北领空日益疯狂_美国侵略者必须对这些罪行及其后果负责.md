Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: While American imperialism unreasonably delays negotiations at Panmunjom, it is sending planes to increasingly frantically violate our northeast airspace and carry out all kinds of provocative activities. According to incomplete statistics, from January to February 9th of this year, enemy planes have intruded into the airspace of Qingduizi, Dagushan, Dadonggou, Andong, Tangshancheng, Fengcheng, Lianshanguan, Benxi, Shenyang, Fushun, Kuandian, Huanren, Jiuliancheng, Gulouzi, Changdianhekou, Yongdianhekou, Anpinghe, Fuyoujie, Jian, Tonghua, Xinbin, Liuhe, Linjiang, Changbai, and other places in our northeast a total of fifty-one batches and two hundred and forty-eight sorties. This is an increase of fifteen batches and one hundred and seventy-five sorties compared to the thirty-six batches and seventy-three sorties in December of last year. Among these, there were four batches of thirty-eight enemy planes on January 7th, five batches of sixty-eight on January 13th, four batches of thirty-five on January 16th, and nine batches of fifty-seven on February 6th, conducting large-scale intrusions into our airspace and barbarically bombing and strafing our peaceful residents. For example, on January 6th, eight enemy planes bombed the Jian railway station, dropping fourteen bombs and wounding three of our railway workers; on January 19th, one enemy plane intruded into Maxian Gou, southwest of Jian, dropping seven bombs, destroying three of our houses, and wounding three cows and one horse; on January 29th and February 1st, four enemy planes twice intruded into the airspace above Gulouzi, northeast of Andong, and conducted strafing. The increasingly frenzied provocative actions of American imperialism fully demonstrate why American imperialism is repeatedly and unreasonably delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, and also fully demonstrate that American imperialism is actively carrying out a conspiracy to expand its war of aggression. The Chinese people will never tolerate this situation. American imperialism must be held responsible for these crimes and their consequences.

    美机侵犯我东北领空日益疯狂
    美国侵略者必须对这些罪行及其后果负责
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义一面在板门店无理地拖延谈判，一面则派飞机日益疯狂地侵犯我东北领空，进行种种挑衅活动。据不完全统计，自今年一月到本月九日止，四十日中敌机即先后侵入我东北青堆子、大孤山、大东沟、安东、汤山城、凤城、连山关、本溪、沈阳、抚顺、宽甸、桓仁、九连城、鼓楼子、长甸河口、永甸河口、安平河、富有街、辑安、通化、新宾、柳河、临江、长白等地上空，竟达五十一批二百四十八架次，较去年十二月份敌机侵犯我东北领空三十六批七十三架次，增加了十五批一百七十五架次。其中一月七日一天中就有敌机四批三十八架次，一月十三日有五批六十八架次，一月十六日有四批三十五架次，二月六日有九批五十七架次，向我领空进行大规模的侵扰，并向我和平居民进行野蛮的轰炸和扫射。如一月六日敌机八架轰炸我辑安车站投弹十四枚，炸伤我铁路员工三人；一月十九日敌机一架侵入我辑安西南之麻线沟投弹七枚，炸坏我房子三间，炸伤牛三头，马一匹；一月二十九日、二月一日敌机四架两次侵入我安东东北之鼓楼子上空进行扫射。美帝国主义这种日益疯狂的挑衅行动，充分说明了美帝国主义为什么对朝鲜停战谈判一再进行无理的拖延，也充分说明了美帝国主义正在积极地进行着扩大侵略战争的阴谋。中国人民决不能容忍这种情况，美帝国主义必须对这些罪行及其后果负责。
