    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 26th—An Ham-kwang, Secretary-General of the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace, issued a statement on the 25th, sternly protesting the heinous crime of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare.
    An Ham-kwang pointed out: Among the various crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea in trampling on international law, the most serious in terms of scale, planning, and insidiousness is the recent atrocity of massively spreading bacterial insects in the front and rear areas of Korea. However, this ferocious crime of the aggressors cannot intimidate the Korean people, nor can it save their shameful defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, but can only arouse the strong indignation of all the Korean people. We, together with the 475 million Chinese people and all peace fighters in the world, will never allow American imperialism to continue to perpetrate such atrocities.
    An Ham-kwang emphatically pointed out: The Korean peace fighters who are fighting for the independence and freedom of the motherland and the lasting peace of mankind, and all peace-loving people in the world, unanimously demand that the heinous crimes of the American aggressors be stopped, and are determined to fight to the end to investigate the serious international responsibility of the users and organizers of bacteriological weapons.

    安含光抗议美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪行
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会书记长安含光二十五日发表谈话，严正抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战争的滔天罪行。
    安含光指出：美国侵略者在朝鲜所制造的种种蹂躏国际公法的罪行，就其规模、计划及险恶性来说，以最近一次在朝鲜前后方大量撒布细菌毒虫的暴行为最严重。但是，侵略者这种凶恶的罪行吓不倒朝鲜人民，绝不能挽救其侵朝战争的可耻失败，而只能激起全朝鲜人民的强烈愤怒。我们和四亿七千五百万中国人民及全世界所有和平斗士，绝不能容许美帝国主义继续制造这种暴行。
    安含光强调指出：为祖国的独立自由与人类的持久和平而斗争的朝鲜和平斗士和全世界爱好和平的人民，一致要求制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行，坚决要为追究细菌武器的使用者与组织者的严重国际责任而奋斗到底。
