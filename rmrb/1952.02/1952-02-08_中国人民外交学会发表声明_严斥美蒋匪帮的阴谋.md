China People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement
    Sternly Condemning the Conspiracy of the US-Chiang Bandit Gang

    [This newspaper's dispatch] The China People's Institute of Foreign Affairs issued a statement sternly condemning the "Accusation Against the Soviet Union Case" of the United States and the Kuomintang remnant bandits, saying: "The Kuomintang reactionary remnant group is a small handful of remnant bandits who have long been abandoned by the Chinese people and driven out of mainland China. This small handful of remnant bandits are the public enemy of the Chinese people and the most vile and shameless dregs of humanity raised by the United States. This Kuomintang remnant bandit group has long had no reason to forcibly occupy a seat in the United Nations, let alone the right to speak on behalf of anyone. Only because of the obstruction of the United States has the Kuomintang remnant bandit group representative not been expelled from the United Nations to this day.

    This kind of slanderous rumor against China and the Soviet Union has been brought to the United Nations twice by the United States directing the Kuomintang remnant bandit group and suffered miserable defeat both times. Now, these rumors are being put forward again and the United Nations General Assembly is being forced to pass them, which is closely related to the recent military plans and activities of the United States in Southeast Asia against China and the Asian people. There is no doubt that the United States wants to take this opportunity to divert the attention of the people of the world, and vainly attempt to cover up the United States' intention to instigate the Kuomintang remnant bandits and rearm Japan to carry out a new war of aggression against China. The recent active funding and direction by the United States of the Kuomintang remnant bandits on the Burmese border to engage in various activities fully exposes this sinister conspiracy. We must point out that if the American aggressors cannot accept the painful lessons of repeated failures on the Korean battlefield and dare to launch a new military adventure against China, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous failures. We believe that this aggressive plan and activity of the American aggressors, which is hostile to the people of Asia, will inevitably prompt the people of Asian countries to unite further and fight together to prevent new military adventures by the United States in Asia."

    中国人民外交学会发表声明
    严斥美蒋匪帮的阴谋
    【本报讯】中国人民外交学会发表关于严斥美国和国民党残匪的“控苏案”的声明说：“国民党反动残余集团是一小撮早已被中国人民所共弃并被中国人民驱逐出了中国大陆的残匪，这一小撮残匪是中国人民的公敌，是美国所豢养的最下流无耻的人类中的渣滓。这个国民党残匪集团早已没有在联合国中强占席位的任何理由，更没有代表任何人发言的权利，只由于美国的阻挠，才使国民党残匪集团代表到今天还未被驱逐出联合国。
    这种诽谤中苏的谰言，过去已经由美国指使国民党残匪集团两度向联合国提出而两度遭受惨败。现在竟又提出这些谰言并强使联合国大会加以通过，这与美国最近在东南亚对付中国和亚洲人民的军事计划和活动有着密切的关系。毫无疑问，美国是想借此来转移世界人民的注意，妄想借此掩饰住美国指使国民党残匪和重新武装日本来进行对中国新的侵略战争的意图。最近美国积极资助与指挥缅甸边境的国民党残匪从事各种活动，就完全暴露了这种罪恶的阴谋。我们必须指出，如果美国侵略者不能接受在朝鲜战场一再失败的惨重教训，敢于向中国发动新的军事冒险，它就必然会遭受到更惨重的失败。我们相信美国侵略者这种与亚洲人民为敌的侵略计划和活动，也必然会促使亚洲各国人民更进一步的团结起来，为共同制止美国在亚洲的新的军事冒险而斗争。”
