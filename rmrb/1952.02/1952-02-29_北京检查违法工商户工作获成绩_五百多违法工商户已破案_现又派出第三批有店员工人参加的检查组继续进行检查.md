Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: The Beijing Municipal Committee for Practicing Economy and Conducting Inspections has achieved significant success in investigating illegal industrial and commercial businesses. As of February 25th, the investigation of over 500 industrial and commercial businesses has basically been completed, revealing that they stole nearly 400 billion yuan of state property through various illegal means. The second batch of 325 inspection teams dispatched after the Spring Festival has successfully concluded their work, and a third batch of over 300 teams has now been dispatched. In addition to the original staff, this batch of inspection teams is also equipped with a large number of shop employees and workers, making the inspection even more formidable.

Since its commencement last December, the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence in Beijing has rapidly unfolded on two fronts. One front involves the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions mobilizing shop employees and workers to expose and struggle against illegal capitalists. The other front involves the Committee for Practicing Economy and Conducting Inspections dispatching a large number of inspection teams to investigate illegal industrial and commercial businesses.

After the Spring Festival, the scale of these two fronts has further expanded, and the movement has become more in-depth. In terms of inspections, although capitalists had taken advantage of the Spring Festival break to make many preparations to try to muddle through, the inspection team staff closely relied on workers and shop employees, won over and united senior staff, completely shattered the illegal capitalists' conspiracy, and many major problems were uncovered. For example, Wu Guozhen, a treacherous merchant from Qihua Construction Company, only confessed to stealing over 600 million yuan of state assets through shoddy workmanship during the first inspection because there was insufficient mobilization of employees. Based on mass reports, the inspection team conducted a second inspection after the Spring Festival. In this inspection, due to the full mobilization of the masses of employees, Wu Guozhen's "offensive and defensive alliance" was shattered, and the fact that he had stolen more than 1.3 billion yuan of state assets was uncovered.

Among the second batch of illegal industrial and commercial businesses investigated, some, although guilty of serious crimes, confessed relatively thoroughly under the pressure of the masses and were given lenient treatment by the people's government. For example, Huang Zhonglin, manager of Kangning Construction Company, had bribed more than 100 million yuan and stolen more than 8.8 billion yuan of state assets, but he confessed relatively well in this inspection. Another example is Zhou Jichang, manager of Xieshun Construction Company, who had stolen more than 3.4 billion yuan of state property through shoddy workmanship and other methods. He not only confessed more thoroughly but also took the staff to the construction site to inspect the situation of his shoddy workmanship. He also reported others. Therefore, the government gave them the opportunity to atone for their crimes through meritorious service. Eighty percent of the illegal industrial and commercial businesses investigated for the second time have now been released on bail pending further investigation.

However, some treacherous merchants have committed serious violations and refused to confess. Although the inspection team staff and shop employees repeatedly advised and exposed them during the inspection process, they still refused to confess and were determined to resist to the end. The people's government has arrested and dealt with these treacherous merchants according to the law. In order to completely defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Practicing Economy and Conducting Inspections has dispatched a third batch of inspection teams to carry out inspection work. The inspection team staff has gained rich experience in the past two inspection campaigns, and this time a large number of shop employees and workers are participating in the inspection. Therefore, this batch of inspection teams will undoubtedly achieve greater victories.

    北京检查违法工商户工作获成绩
    五百多违法工商户已破案
    现又派出第三批有店员工人参加的检查组继续进行检查
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京市节约检查委员会检查不法工商户的工作获得显著成绩，到本月二十五日止，被检查的五百多家工商户，基本上都已破案，他们以各种违法手段盗窃国家财产近四千亿元。现春节后第二批派出的三百二十五个检查小组的工作已胜利结束，第三批三百多组又已出动。这一批检查组，除了原有的工作人员外，还配备了大批店员工人参加，检查的声势更为浩大。
    北京市的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家财产、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动，自去年十二月开始以来，即在两条战线上迅速开展。一条战线是由市总工会发动店员工人对不法资本家进行检举、斗争，另外一条战线就是由节约检查委员会派遣大批的检查小组对不法工商户进行检查。
    在春节以后，这两条战线的规模更加扩大，运动也更加深入。在检查方面，虽然资本家曾利用春节空隙，作了许多企图蒙混过关的准备，但检查组的工作人员紧密地依靠了工人、店员，争取和团结了高级职员，完全粉碎了不法资本家的阴谋，许多大问题都被检查出来。如启华营造厂奸商吴国桢，在第一次检查时，因发动职工不够，吴国桢伪装坦白，只谈出偷工减料盗窃国家资财六亿多元。检查组根据群众的检举，在春节后作了第二次检查。在这次检查中，因充分发动了职工群众，粉碎了吴国桢的“攻守同盟”，就又检查出他盗窃国家资财十三亿多元的事实。
    在第二批被检查的违法工商户中，有一部分虽然罪恶很大，但他们迫于群众的压力，坦白得比较彻底，人民政府就予以从宽处理。如康宁营造厂经理黄钟琳曾以一亿多元行贿，盗窃国家资财八十八亿多元，但在这次检查中，他坦白得比较好；又如协顺营造厂经理周继昌曾以偷工减料等办法，盗窃国家财产三十四亿余元，他不仅坦白较彻底，而且带着工作人员到工程地点去检视他偷工减料的情形。他并检举了别人。因此，政府都给予了他们立功赎罪的机会。第二次被检查的违法工商户中，现已有百分之八十取保听候处理。
    但有一部分奸商却违法严重而又拒不坦白。检查组工作人员和店员工人在检查过程中虽曾再三劝告、揭发，但他们仍然拒不坦白，决心顽抗到底。对于这批奸商，人民政府已予逮捕法办。为了彻底打垮资产阶级的猖狂进攻，北京市节约检查委员会又派出了第三批检查组进行检查工作。检查组的工作人员已在过去的两次检查工作中获得了丰富的经验，这次又有大批的店员工人参加检查。所以，这一批检查组，无疑将要获得更大的胜利。
