    A Peking University Teacher
    Should Not Introduce Poisonous Books to Beginners
    Recently, a political economics teacher at Peking University introduced Karl Kautsky's "Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx" to students for reference. I think this is very inappropriate. This teacher thought that the book could be referenced because it was written before Kautsky's open betrayal. However, we know that Kautsky's erroneous views had already taken root. The teacher also used the fact that the book had been read by Engels as proof of its correctness; however, we know that in an 1884 letter to Kautsky, Engels had already pointed out the errors in the book, pointing out that Kautsky had not grasped Marx's theory of value.
    Kautsky's becoming a traitor to Marxism and the so-called "theoretician" of the Second International was by no means accidental. His "Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx" is a book that theoretically distorts Marx's economic doctrines with poisonous elements, written before his open betrayal.
    The translated version of this book was widely circulated and very influential in our country. As early as 1920, it was re-translated into Chinese from Japanese by Chen Puxian of the Communist Study Society. Soon after, the war criminal Dai Chuanxian also translated this book, and later Wang Fuquan re-translated it from Japanese and published it by Shenzhou Guoguang Society. After liberation, Shenzhou Guoguang Society reprinted it in large quantities in Shanghai under the name of Duo Mei.
    This book has been deeply criticized by Soviet economic scholars and has long disappeared from the market. For more than a decade, China's advanced economists have also made strong criticisms of Kautsky's book.
    In summary, the main errors of the book are: First, comrades who study political economy all know that the object of political economy is not the goods themselves, but the relations of production between people hidden behind the goods, that is, the relations between classes. However, when Kautsky introduced Marx's formula for commodity circulation, he only explained the form of commodity-money-commodity transformation, without analyzing the essence of commodity relations through this manifestation, thus falling into the error of vulgar school economists.
    Second, in terms of theoretical system, Kautsky did not understand Das Kapital at all. He not only abandoned almost all of the content of the second and third volumes of Das Kapital, but also severed the theoretical system of the first volume of Das Kapital. He mechanically combined economic categories of different natures, such as commodities, money, and capital, and mechanically separated the organically linked categories of capital and surplus value. He did not know that the chapter on "the capitalization of money" is the core of the first volume of Das Kapital, so he vulgarized Marx's economic doctrines.
    Third, in terms of methodology, Kautsky was completely ignorant of dialectics, so he could not point out the inherent contradictions that serve as the basic driving force for the emergence, development, and eventual demise of capitalism and its various economic categories. This error is closely related to the serious errors committed by Kautsky in his theory of imperialism—the "ultra-imperialism theory" (which Lenin subjected to devastating criticism)—and his shameful behavior in practice of finally degenerating into an open traitor to Marxism.
    Therefore, I hope that Shenzhou Guoguang Society and other private publishers will no longer print books with serious theoretical and political errors like Kautsky's "Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx." I also hope that teachers who introduce this type of book to students will humbly examine their own erroneous thoughts, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and strive to be a true people's teacher in this vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and in the ideological remolding study for teachers.

### 北京大学某教师  不该给初学者介绍有毒的书籍

    北京大学某教师
    不该给初学者介绍有毒的书籍
    最近北京大学的一位政治经济学教师介绍了考茨基所著的“马克思底经济学说”一书给初学的同学参考，我认为这是很不妥当的。这位教师以为该书既是考茨基公开叛变以前写的，所以就可以参考；可是我们知道，考茨基的错误见解是早已种下根基了的。这位教师又以该书曾经过恩格斯阅读为理由而证明其正确；可是我们知道，在一八八四年恩格斯给考茨基的信中，早已指出该书的错误，指出考茨基并没有掌握住马克思的价值学说。
    考茨基成为马克思主义的叛徒和第二国际的所谓“理论家”，决不是偶然的。他的“马克思底经济学说”一书就是他在公开叛变以前的一本在理论上曲解马克思经济学说的有毒素的书籍。
    该书的译本在我国流行较广，很有影响。早在一九二○年就经共学社陈溥贤从日文重译成中文出版，不久，战犯戴传贤也翻译过此书，后来汪馥泉又从日文重译由神州国光社出版。解放以后，神州国光社又以铎梅译的名义在上海大量再版。
    这本书在苏联经济经过学者的深刻批判，现在市场上早已绝迹。十几年以来，我国先进的经济学者对考茨基这本书也作过有力的批判。
    归纳起来，该书的主要错误是：一、研究政治经济学的同志都知道政治经济学的研究对象不是物品本身，而是隐藏在物的背后的人与人之间的生产关系，也就是阶级与阶级之间的关系。可是考茨基在介绍马克思的商品流通的公式时，只说明了商品——货币——商品变换的形式，而没有通过这一表现形式去分析商品关系的本质，因此陷入庸俗学派经济学者的错误里面去了。
    二、在理论体系上，考茨基更是不懂得资本论的。他不但把资本论第二卷和第三卷的内容几乎全部抛弃了，而且也割裂了资本论第一卷的理论体系。他把不同性质的经济范畴，如商品、货币与资本加以机械的结合，又把资本与剩余价值这两个有机连系的范畴机械地分割了。他不知道“货币的资本化”一篇是资本论第一卷的核心，所以把马克思的经济学说加以庸俗化了。
    三、在方法论上，考茨基对于辩证法是完全愚昧无知的，因此他不能指出作为资本主义及其各种经济范畴的发生、发展而最后促其灭亡的基本动力的内在的矛盾。这一错误是与考茨基在其帝国主义论——“超帝国主义论”中所犯的严重错误（列宁曾对之加以毁灭性的批判），及其在实践上终于沦为马克思主义公开的叛徒的可耻行为密切相关的。
    因此，我希望神州国光社和其他私人出版商不要再印像考茨基的“马克思底经济学说”这一类理论上、政治上有严重错误的书籍。我还希望介绍这一类书给同学阅读的教师们在此次轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中及在教师改造思想的学习中，虚心地检查一下自己的错误思想，分清敌我界限，争取做一个名符其实的人民教师。  张友仁
