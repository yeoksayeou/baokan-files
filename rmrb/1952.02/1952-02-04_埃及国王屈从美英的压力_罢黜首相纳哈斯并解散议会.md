    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, Cairo dispatch: On January 27th, Egyptian King Farouk, after consulting with the US Ambassador to Egypt, Caffery, dismissed Nahas from his post as Egyptian Prime Minister and dissolved Parliament, just hours before Nahas was about to announce the severance of diplomatic relations with Britain. He then ordered Maher to form a new government.
    American newspapers openly admitted that this was the result of American intervention.
    Nahas, under the unanimous demands of the Egyptian people, had adopted an uncompromising attitude toward Britain. This clearly made the United States, which had common interests with Britain in this strategic region, very uneasy. United Press reporter Gonzals in Washington, speaking of information obtained from a US State Department spokesman, said: US Ambassador to Egypt Caffery had frequent consultations with Egyptian representatives in the past few days. American newspapers revealed that the purpose of the consultations was to force Egypt to replace Nahas. According to American newspaper reports, Caffery visited Egyptian King Farouk the day before Nahas was dismissed—January 26—and presented a memorandum on ending the Egyptian "riots." According to the "Wall Street Journal," the US ambassador reportedly indicated that the United States did not consider this a joke. The newspaper also said that US State Department officials actually suggested candidates to succeed Nahas. According to International News Service Cairo, Maher had served as Egyptian Prime Minister twice and had been imprisoned for pro-Nazi sympathies.
    British newspapers generally expressed satisfaction with Maher's rise to power, believing that this gave new hope for the restoration of Anglo-Egyptian relations. The Conservative "Daily Mail" said: "New Prime Minister Maher is an old friend of Britain, and King Farouk made a smart choice." In a commentary on the Egyptian events on January 28, the American "New York Times" openly declared that the Egyptian events were an American affair, and that the United States must assume the responsibilities placed upon it by its power.

    埃及国王屈从美英的压力  
    罢黜首相纳哈斯并解散议会
    【新华社二日讯】开罗消息：一月二十七日，埃及国王法鲁克在与美国驻埃及大使加佛利会商之后，在埃及首相纳哈斯将要宣布与英国断绝外交关系之前数小时将纳哈斯撤职，解散了议会，并命马赫尔筹组新政府。
    美国的报纸毫不讳言这是美国进行干涉的结果。
    纳哈斯在埃及人民的一致要求下，对英国采取了不妥协的态度。这显然使和英国在这一战略地区有着共同利益的美国大为不安。合众社驻华盛顿记者贡札尔斯谈到从美国国务院发言人得来的消息说：美国驻埃及大使加佛利过去几天内曾与埃及代表频繁磋商。美国报纸透露，磋商的目的就是迫使埃及撤换纳哈斯。据美国报纸消息，加佛利在纳哈斯撤职前一天——一月二十六日——曾拜访埃及国王法鲁克，并呈递关于结束埃及“骚乱”的备忘录。据“华尔街日报”称：据说美国大使曾表示美国认为这不是开玩笑的事情。报纸还说，美国国务院的官员实际上提出了纳哈斯的继任人选。据国际新闻社开罗消息，马赫尔曾两度出任埃及首相，并曾因亲纳粹而坐过监牢。
    英国报纸对于马赫尔的上台普遍表示满意，认为这使恢复英埃关系有了新的希望。保守党的“每日邮报”说：“新首相马赫尔是英国的一位老朋友，国王法鲁克选择得很聪明。”一月二十八日美国的“纽约时报”在评论埃及事件时，公然宣称埃及事件是美国的事情，并且说美国必须担负起它的力量所加于它的责任。
