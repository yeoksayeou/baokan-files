    A Review of the Blind Promotion of Sparse Planting of Cotton
    Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry
    The People's Daily criticized on February 11th that Hebei Province's blind promotion of sparse planting methods for cotton resulted in reduced cotton production; we believe this criticism is entirely correct. Our blind promotion of sparse planting of cotton, causing undue losses to the country's accumulation of wealth and increased income for cotton farmers, is a serious error. Agricultural leaders at all levels and agricultural technicians should conduct a deep self-examination to clarify the root causes of the error ideologically, so that future technical guidance work can be theoretically improved. We now conduct the following self-examination and will implement corrections in future work.

    How did the guiding ideology of sparse planting of cotton originate?

    1.  Lack of theoretical analysis of the masses' experience in high yields, being misled by the phenomenon of high yields with sparse planting. In 1949, our province lacked a clear understanding of which was better, sparse or dense planting, in terms of technical guidance for high cotton yields, so no opinions were offered on the issue of row and plant spacing. In 1950, during our investigation of typical examples of high cotton yields, we found that Liang Jiarui's cotton in Shijiazhuang produced 480 jin of seed cotton per mu, with 95 percent of the flowers blooming before the frost, row spacing of 1.9 chi, plant spacing of 2 chi, and 1,500 plants per mu. Zhou Shun's cotton in Linqing County produced 450 jin of seed cotton per mu, with 92.5 percent of the flowers blooming before the frost, row spacing of 1.8 chi, plant spacing of 1.6 chi, totaling about 2,000 plants per mu. Zhao Chenglu's cotton on large ridges after wheat harvest in Weijiazhuang, Fengnan County, had a row spacing of 3 chi, plant spacing of 1.5 chi, totaling 1,500 plants per mu, produced 480 jin of seed cotton per mu, with half of the flowers blooming after the frost. Thus, based on the experience of these cotton-growing models in our province, we made the erroneous conclusion that sparse planting was the only way to achieve high cotton yields. We mistakenly believed that all the experiences of the masses were good, but we were limited to the experiences of a few and lacked investigation and research among the broad masses. This failure to seriously summarize the masses' experiences and rashly promote them proves that there was serious carelessness and bureaucratism in our work, and also shows that we lacked theoretical knowledge and mechanically understood the issue.

    2.  Lack of understanding of the interconnectedness and complementarity of comprehensive yield-increasing factors. The idea of "sparse planting on fertile land, dense planting on barren land" was fixed in our minds. We believed that our province was an old liberated area, and after the land reform, the masses' enthusiasm for production had increased, and they had the ability to expand reproduction. Cotton required a lot of manure and water, so it needed to be sparsely planted, otherwise it would grow "crazy." We failed to recognize that sufficient nutrients and water could supply more cotton plants. The small size of sparsely planted cotton plants was precisely due to insufficient nutrients; as for the "crazy growth" problem, it could be solved by strengthening and improving pruning techniques. When we considered reducing flower and boll drop to increase yields, we always circled around the idea that wide rows and sparse planting could improve ventilation and lighting, making it easier to prevent and control diseases and pests, without considering the appropriate combination of fertilizers, the appropriate supply of water, and strengthening cultivation management. In addition, in order to facilitate field management, improve ventilation and lighting, and change farmers' habit of planting narrow rows, we mistakenly proposed widening plant spacing and row spacing, and believed that the distance between rows and plants should be such that branches and leaves do not overlap, without considering the relationship between nutrient supply and demand and artificial control. This shows that there was extreme one-sidedness in our way of thinking, and a lack of overall research and analysis.

    3.  Under the domination of empiricism, we ignored the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, arbitrarily believing that the Soviet Union had different soil, climate, cultivation methods, and varieties than China, saying that "dense planting is right in the Soviet Union, sparse planting is right in China." As a result, we made mistakes. The work of technical cadres was not thorough, detached from reality, lacking investigation and research, and they simply echoed what others said. No technical cadre raised any questions during our promotion of sparse planting. As for the basis for the idea that sparse planting could increase yields, we did not think about it carefully; we sold it as we learned it, committing serious liberalism of irresponsibility in technical guidance work.

    Under the guidance of the erroneous sparse planting ideology, the result of the promotion by agricultural departments at all levels in Hebei Province was that although sparse planting of cotton has not been universally accepted by the broad masses, it has been accepted by active elements in the countryside. In general, active elements plant about 1,500 cotton plants per mu; in individual cases, such as Chen Luofen in Huaidi Village, Shijiazhuang City, only 900 cotton plants were planted per mu, resulting in a negative impact on unit area yield. In Boyan Village, Wu'an County, Li Yubao planted 1,700 cotton plants per mu, while Jia Yuyun planted 2,260 cotton plants per mu. Jia applied less fertilizer, resulting in equal yields for both households. Similarly, in the same village, Wen Deshi had three mu of cotton, half of which had 2,300 plants per mu, and the other half had 1,400 plants per mu, resulting in a yield reduction of 40 jin of seed cotton per mu for the sparse planting. If calculated based on these materials, the losses from sparse planting of cotton are alarming. Due to the government's call and the leading role of active elements in sparse planting, many farmers have adopted the idea that sparse planting is better. For example, in 26 villages, including Tiantaishan in Feixiang County, dryland cotton averaged 3,480 plants per mu, but during the investigation, farmers only reported about 2,000 plants, in order to conceal the fact of dense planting. In Tiantaishan and other villages, due to the dense planting of cotton, the high yield achievement of an average of 184 jin of seed cotton per mu on more than 60,000 mu of cotton fields has become a prick that pains our sparse planting ideology.

    Our mistake in guiding sparse planting of cotton was pointed out by Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, when he came to our province to inspect work in October 1951, which sounded the alarm for us and has been initially corrected.

    In order to reverse the cotton production cadres' guiding ideology of sparse planting of cotton, we convened directors of various cotton production guidance zones to practice at the Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming School in Beijing, and also visited farms and the Central Agricultural Science Research Institute to see the facts of high cotton yields through dense planting, clarifying that dense planting is the future direction of high yields, and put forward opinions on leading dense planting. At the same time, we also organized agricultural technical cadre visiting groups to visit Shanxi, Pingyuan, Shaanxi and other places to learn from their experiences. In particular, after visiting the high-yielding cotton fields of Qu Yaoli, a labor model in Shanxi Province, we deeply recognized the benefits of dense planting. In addition, when summarizing the high-yield experiences of labor models in various places in 1951, we also corrected the past practice of neglecting criticism.

    We have clearly recognized that dense planting is the direction of high yields, and are determined to implement appropriate dense planting based on the existing foundation, according to the climate, soil quality, and cultivation technology level of different regions. We have included the leadership of dense planting as one of the contents of cultivating labor models to drive the masses to high yields, and vigorously promote the reversal of mass thinking; we are conducting dense planting cultivation experiments on various farms, accumulating cultivation experience from the aspects of pruning and water and fertilizer supply.

    对盲目推广棉花稀植法的检讨
    河北省人民政府农林厅
    二月十一日人民日报批评河北省盲目推广棉花稀植办法，使棉花减产；我们认为这个批评是十分正确的。我们盲目推广棉花稀植，使国家在积累财富、增加棉农收益上受到不应有的损失，错误是严重的。各级农业领导部门和农业技术干部应作深刻检查，从思想上明确认识错误的根源，使今后技术指导工作从理论上提高一步。现在我们作如下检查，并在今后工作中贯彻纠正。
    棉花稀植的指导思想是怎样产生的呢？
    一、对群众丰产经验，缺乏理论分析，被稀植丰产现象所迷惑。一九四九年我省在棉花丰产技术指导上，对稀植、密植那个好的问题没有明确的认识，因此对行株距离问题没有提出意见。一九五零年我们在棉花丰产典型调查中，发现石家庄梁家瑞的棉花，每亩产四百八十斤籽棉，霜前花占百分之九十五，行距一尺九寸，株距二尺，每亩一千五百株。临清县周顺的棉花，每亩产四百五十斤籽棉，霜前花占百分之九十二点五，行距一尺八寸，株距一尺六寸，每亩约合二千棵。丰南县魏家庄赵成禄的大垄麦茬棉，行距三尺，株距一尺五寸，每亩合一千五百棵，每亩产四百八十斤籽棉，霜后花占一半。于是就根据本省这些种棉模范的丰产经验，作出了棉花稀植才能达到丰产的错误结论。我们错误地认为凡是群众的经验都是好的，但是局限于少数群众的经验，缺乏在广大群众中进行调查研究。这样不认真总结群众经验，草率地进行推广，证明我们工作上，存在着严重的粗枝大叶和官僚主义作风，也说明了我们缺乏理论知识，而是机械地认识问题。
    二、缺乏对综合丰产因子联因互补的认识。“肥地应稀、瘦地应密”，在我们思想中是定型的。我们认为我省是老区，土地改革以后群众生产情绪提高，有扩大再生产的能力，棉花粪大水勤就需要稀植，否则会长“疯”的。没有认识到养分水分充足了，能供应更多的棉棵。棉棵种的少，长的小，正是因为养分不足造成的；至于“疯秧”问题，可以从加强与提高整枝技术上解决。我们考虑减少落花落铃以达到提高产量的问题时，也总是在宽垄稀植可以通风透光，便于防除病虫上打圈子，没有从肥料的适量配合、水分的适量供应、加强中耕管理等方面去考虑问题。另外，为了便于田间管理，通风透光，扭转农民种窄垄的习惯，我们错误地提出加宽株距放宽行距，并认为行株距离的远近，以枝不搭枝、叶不搭叶为适宜，没有从养分的供求关系上和人工控制上去考虑问题。这说明我们在思想方法上有极端的片面性，缺乏整体的研究分析。
    三、在经验主义的支配下，忽视了苏联的先进经验，武断地认为苏联与我国的风土气候、栽培方法、品种等条件不同，说什么“苏联密植是对的，在中国稀植是对的”。结果我们犯了错误。技术干部的工作不深入，脱离实际，不调查研究，人云亦云。我们推广稀植的过程中，没有一位技术干部提出疑问。至于稀植可以丰产又有什么根据呢，脑子里却没有细想；怎样学来的就怎样卖，犯了严重的对技术指导工作不负责任的自由主义。
    在错误的稀植思想指导下，河北省各级农业部门推广的结果，棉花稀植虽尚未为广大群众所普遍接受，但已为农村中积极分子所接受。一般的积极分子，每亩棉株在一千五百棵左右；个别的如石家庄市槐底村陈洛芬每亩只种九百棵棉花，致使单位面积产量受到影响。武安县伯延村李玉保的棉花每亩一千七百棵，贾玉云每亩二千二百六十棵，贾施肥少，结果两户产量相等。又如同村温得时，三亩棉花当中，有一半合每亩二千三百棵，另一半每亩一千四百棵，结果稀植产量每亩少收四十斤籽棉。如以这些材料为根据计算，棉花稀植的损失是惊人的。由于政府的号召及积极分子的带头稀植，不少农民有了以稀植为好的思想。如肥乡县天台山等二十六村，旱地棉花平均每亩三千四百八十棵，在调查时，农民却只说二千棵左右，用以掩盖密植的事实。天台山等村，由于棉花密植，六万多亩棉田每亩平均产一百八十四斤籽棉的丰产成绩，已成为刺痛我们稀植指导思想的针砭。
    我们指导棉花稀植的错误，在一九五一年十月，中央人民政府农业部杨显东副部长来我省检查工作时，指出了这一缺点，已经给我们敲了警钟，并已作了初步纠正。
    为了扭转棉产干部对棉花稀植的指导思想，我们曾召集各棉产指导区主任，到北京双桥机耕学校实习，又到农场及中央农业科学研究所参观棉花密植丰产的事实，明确了密植是今后的丰产方向，并提出领导密植的意见。同时，也组织了农业技术干部参观团，到山西、平原、陕西等地进行参观，吸取经验。特别是参观山西省劳动模范曲耀离的丰产棉田后，深刻认识到密植的好处。另外，在一九五一年总结各地劳动模范丰产经验时，也纠正了过去忽视批判的作法。
    我们明确认识了密植是丰产的方向，决在现有基础上，按不同地区的气候、土质、栽培技术水平，适当密植。我们已把密植的领导列为培养劳动模范带动群众丰产的内容之一，并大力宣传扭转群众思想；在各农场进行密植栽培试验，从整枝及水分肥料供给方面积累栽培经验。
