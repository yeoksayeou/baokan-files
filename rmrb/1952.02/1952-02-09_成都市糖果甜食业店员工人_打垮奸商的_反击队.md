    Chengdu Candy and Confectionery Shop Employees
    The "Counter-Attack Team" That Defeated the Unscrupulous Merchants

    In the movement against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property, the employees of the Chengdu Candy and Confectionery Shop defeated the "Counter-Attack Team" organized by unscrupulous merchants in the industry. The unscrupulous merchants who spearheaded the organization of the "Counter-Attack Team" have been arrested and dealt with according to the law by the People's Government.

    The Chengdu Candy and Confectionery Trade Association has long been controlled by illegal merchants. Zheng Daguang, the chairman of the association, and Liang Yuanzhong, the vice-chairman, are both veterans of bribery and tax evasion. Zheng Daguang, in collusion with the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Zhicheng, once defrauded the state of over 140 million yuan in assets. When the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property was fiercely launched, Zheng Daguang, fearing exposure by the shop employees, colluded with more than 20 unscrupulous merchants in the industry to drink alcohol and take oaths, organizing the so-called "Counter-Attack Team." This developed from individual resistance to organized and planned sabotage. At the instigation of Zheng and others, more than ten unscrupulous merchants, including "Counter-Attack Team" members Dou Wenjun and Yan Decheng, fabricated facts in the form of false "confessions" at the industry's self-criticism meetings, falsely accusing Peng Min, the trade union leader who actively led the shop employees in the struggle against Zheng Daguang and others, of accepting bribes and protecting their tax evasion, in an attempt to disintegrate the trade union leadership and evade exposure. "Counter-Attack Team" members also used despicable methods such as "honey traps" and banquets to win over shop employees and trade union cadres, attempting to soften the workers' fighting spirit and steal intelligence about trade union activities. Unscrupulous merchants Chen Yurun and Zhou Qinting even resorted to using their daughters and wives to seduce trade union cadres. Against shop employees who could not be bought over, "Counter-Attack Team" members took despicable measures such as closing down shops, suspending wages, and withholding food to threaten them. The unscrupulous merchant Chen Zezhong threatened shop employees, saying, "If you bring me down, I can still sell my furniture and eat for several years, but you will only starve!" Under the unified deployment of the "Counter-Attack Team," seven "Counter-Attack Team" members who were preparing to close down their businesses to evade the struggle were unafraid, and some even had positions arranged for them by Zheng Daguang in the trade association. As a result, the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property movement in the industry made no progress in the half-month from January 12th to 26th. Among the more than 1,000 members, fewer than ten confessed to bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property. At the so-called "self-criticism meeting" on January 25th, manipulated by "Counter-Attack Team" members, the unscrupulous merchants even turned the target of struggle towards the shop employees. "Counter-Attack Team" member Liu Maolun and others even took the lead in shouting reactionary slogans such as "Brothers, unite and open fire on the shop employees!" and made reactionary "resolutions" such as "encircling and suppressing the 'illegal' behavior of shop employees," bringing their arrogance to a climax.

    The Candy and Confectionery Shop Employees' Trade Union was determined to counter the "Counter-Attackers." They fully mobilized the masses, receiving more than 130 pieces of material from shop employees in various streets reporting Zheng Daguang and others for secretly organizing the "Counter-Attack Team." At the city-wide shop employees' representative meeting on January 31st, representatives of the Candy and Confectionery Shop Employees' Trade Union accused Zheng Daguang and other unscrupulous merchants of their crimes. Based on the above facts, the Municipal People's Government immediately arrested and dealt with according to the law the unscrupulous merchants Zheng Daguang and Liang Yuanzhong, who spearheaded the organization of the "Counter-Attack Team" to sabotage the movement. Most of the unscrupulous merchants who had participated in the "Counter-Attack Team" surrendered and confessed their crimes. More than ten unscrupulous merchants, including Chen Yurun and Dou Wenjun, have confessed to bribery, tax evasion, and sabotage of the movement. The fighting spirit of the shop employees in the industry is even higher, and more than 140 pieces of material have been reported exposing illegal activities by unscrupulous merchants. The anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property movement in the industry is flourishing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    成都市糖果甜食业店员工人
    打垮奸商的“反击队”
    成都市糖果甜食业店员工人在反行贿、反偷税、反盗窃国家资财运动中，击垮了该业奸商组织的“反击队”。为首组织“反击队”的奸商已被人民政府逮捕法办。
    成都市糖果甜食业同业公会一向为不法商人所把持。公会主任委员郑大光、副主任委员梁援中等都是行贿、漏税的老手。郑大光伙同奸商赵志成一次即骗取了国家资财一亿四千多万元。当反行贿、反偷税、反盗窃国家资财斗争猛烈展开时，郑大光害怕店员检举，勾结同业奸商二十多人饮酒宣誓，组织所谓“反击队”，由个别的抗拒发展到有组织有计划地进行破坏活动。在郑等唆使下，“反击队”分子窦文俊、鄢德成等十多个奸商，在该业坦白检举大会上以假“坦白”方式捏造事实，诬告积极领导该业店员向郑大光等进行斗争的工会负责人彭敏，说彭敏曾接受贿赂，包庇他们漏税，妄图瓦解工会领导，逃避检举。“反击队”分子又用“美人计”、请客等卑鄙手段拉拢店员工人和工会干部，企图软化工人斗争情绪，窃取工会活动情报。“反击队”分子陈雨润、周钦庭等奸商竟不惜以女儿、妻子勾引工会干部。对无法收买拉拢的店员工人，“反击队”分子便采取关门停业、不发薪资、不给饭吃等卑鄙手段进行威胁。奸商陈泽中威胁店员说：“把我闹垮了，卖家具都要吃几年，你们却只有饿饭！”在“反击队”的统一部署下，七家准备停业逃避斗争的“反击队”分子有恃无恐，有的并由郑大光在同业公会安插好了位置。因此，该业反行贿、反偷税、反盗窃国家资财运动自一月十二日至二十六日的半个月中毫无进展，一千多会员中坦白行贿、漏税、盗窃国家资财者尚不足十人。在一月二十五日由“反击队”分子操纵的所谓“坦白检举大会”上，奸商们甚至将斗争目标转向店员工人。“反击队”分子刘茂伦等竟带头高呼反动口号“同业们团结起来向店员工人开火！”并作出“对店员工人‘不法’行为进行围剿”等反动“决议”，嚣张气焰达于顶点。
    糖果甜食业店员工会决心予“反击者”以反击。他们充分发动群众，接到各街店员检举郑大光等秘密组织“反击队”的材料达一百三十多件。在一月三十一日全市店员工人代表会上，糖果甜食业店员工会代表控诉了郑大光等奸商的罪行。市人民政府根据上述事实，当场将为首组织“反击队”破坏运动的奸商郑大光、梁援中逮捕法办。过去参加“反击队”的大部分奸商纷纷自首、低头认罪。奸商陈雨润、窦文俊等十多人已分别坦白了行贿、漏税和破坏运动的罪行。该业店员工人斗争情绪更为高昂，先后检举出奸商违法材料一百四十多件。该业反行贿、反漏税、反盗窃国家资财运动蓬勃开展起来。  （新华社）
