    Parisian People Hold Mass Meeting
    Against Rearmament of West Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 20th dispatch from Paris] According to a TASS report from Paris: Recently, French working people held a mass meeting at the Palais de la Mutualité in Paris against the armament of West Germany. The meeting was convened by the Seine Provincial Peace Council. Speakers at the meeting included the renowned public figure General Petit, and the Chairman of the French National Peace Council, Fajon, among others. The meeting also decided to send a delegation to visit members of the French National Assembly in order to protest against West German remilitarization.
    Speaking at the meeting, Petit emphasized that the move to arm West Germany, which violates French interests, is being carried out under pressure from the American ruling clique and with the consent of the French government. In his speech, Fajon exposed the purpose of establishing the "European Army." He pointed out that in the so-called "European Army," former Hitler party members will play a major role. Therefore, this army can precisely enable German revanchists to achieve their goals. All speakers at the meeting called on the French people to intensify their struggle against the rearmament of West Germany.

    巴黎人民举行大会
    反对重新武装西德
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：最近，法国劳动人民曾在巴黎团结宫举行了反对武装西德的群众大会，会议是由塞纳省和平理事会召集的，在会上讲话的有著名的公众领袖柏蒂将军，法国全国和平理事会主席法奇等。会议并决定派遣代表团访问法国国民议会议员，以便对西德重新军国主义化提出抗议。
    柏蒂在会上发言时强调指出，违背法国利益的武装西德的举动，是在美国统治集团的压力和法国政府的同意下进行的。法奇在发言中揭露了建立“欧洲军”的目的。他指出，在所谓“欧洲军”里，前希特勒党徒将起着主要的作用，因此这个军队恰恰可以使德国的复仇主义分子达到他们的目的。会上所有的发言者都号召法国人民加紧进行反对武装西德的斗争。
