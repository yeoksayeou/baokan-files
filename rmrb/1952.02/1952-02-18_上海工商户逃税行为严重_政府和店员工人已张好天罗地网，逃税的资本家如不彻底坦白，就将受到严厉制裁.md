Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 17th: Since liberation, tax evasion and avoidance by Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors has been extremely serious. From May 1949 to the end of 1951, the Shanghai Tax Bureau investigated and dealt with as many as 155,856 cases according to law. The total amount of evaded taxes was over 260 billion yuan, not including the materials recently reported or confessed (the number of uninvestigated cases should be several times higher than this). If this 260 billion yuan were used to develop industry, it could establish nearly three complete yarn factories with 30,000 spindles each; if used to purchase weapons, it could buy more than 170 fighter planes; if used to build worker housing, it could accommodate 10,000 worker families of five.

Tax evasion is extremely common among industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai. After the first term business tax was paid in 1950, the Municipal Tax Bureau sampled 351 taxpayers and found that tax evaders accounted for about 99%. In the spring of the same year, the Municipal Tax Bureau conducted another city-wide audit. During the sampling process, it was found that within the city's more than 270 industries, all taxpayers in more than 50 industries, such as bicycles, steel refining, and paint manufacturing, committed varying degrees of tax evasion.

Creating false accounts is a common tax evasion method used by Shanghai industrial and commercial businesses. After the evaluation of industrial and commercial taxes in June, July, and August 1950, the Municipal Tax Bureau conducted an audit of the rice business. The results of investigating 77 companies revealed that 67 of them had evaded taxes by creating false accounts, accounting for about 88% of the audited households. The methods used by illegal capitalists to create false accounts are very cunning. The owner of Sun Qingji firewood shop on Rihui East Road shouted and made a scene at the tax officials, saying: "My accounts are guaranteed to be without problems. If you check like this, every shop on Rihui East Road will have to close down." Later, the Tax Bureau staff made a surprise inspection of the shop and found a strange study manual, which contained words such as "Dragon," "Phoenix," "Tiger," and "Peng," as well as some numbers. When questioned, the奸商 (treacherous merchant) cunningly claimed it was a study manual. Only after stern questioning did he admit that it was a record of secret accounts. Some奸商 also exposed their extremely reactionary thinking when creating false accounts. When the owner of Lao Hexing Huayang Grocery Store in Huangpu District created secret accounts to evade more than 290 million yuan in taxes, he falsely opened the names of two customers: one was "Tao Guangrong," meaning "tax evasion is glorious"; the other was "Jiang Guomin," meaning "the國民 (citizen) of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits."

Another method of tax evasion used by Shanghai industrial and commercial businesses is to exploit loopholes. During the inventory tax supplement organized by the Tax Bureau in the summer of 1950, some merchants registered various raw materials. However, after the Tax Bureau announced that self-used raw materials were exempt from supplementary commodity tax, some奸商 took advantage of the loophole and claimed that many non-self-used raw materials were self-used, and even requested tax refunds for those that had already been supplemented with tax, falsely claiming they were self-used raw materials. Xie Xing Foundry refunded taxes on the grounds of self-used raw materials one day, but sold two tons of pig iron on the market the next day. Not only that, but many capitalists systematically and organizationally engaged in collective tax evasion. For example, Weng Minru, the chairman of the Hardware Business Association and the owner of Litai Xiang Hardware Store, engaged in the crime of collective tax evasion under the guise of "progress." In August 1950, he colluded with two hardware stores in the same industry, Shunchang Tai and Ruichang, to import goods from Hong Kong. Under the pretext of having their own foreign exchange, they remitted funds from Shanghai to Guangzhou and sent people to Guangzhou and Hong Kong to negotiate the purchase of goods. After the goods arrived in Shanghai, he used the name of a trading company to issue white invoices, falsely raising the cost of imported goods, concealing the original vouchers, and covering up the facts of his import transactions, thereby evading huge amounts of income tax. From 1949 to 1950, he also colluded with several companies in the same industry, colluding with Tianjin Huamao Import and Export Company, using the names of three trading companies, using the same method to cover up the true situation of his business, and transferring profits to bad debts, not only evading a large amount of funds, but also causing huge losses to national tax revenue. Some奸商 not only evaded and avoided the taxes they should have paid, but also swallowed up the trading taxes they withheld and paid on behalf of others. Among the 120 brokers in the Shanghai Fish Market, 31 embezzled the trading tax, with a total embezzlement of more than 5 billion yuan.

The amount of national tax evaded by illegal industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai is not only staggering, but they also stubbornly resist the inspection of the People's Government and obstruct shop employees and workers from assisting the government in collecting taxes. For example, Minfeng and Fenghua paper mills evaded a staggering 11.8222 million yuan in taxes in 1950 alone. When the Tax Bureau discovered that the accounts of the two paper mills were chaotic and sent personnel to inspect them last year, the capitalists of the two paper mills obstructed them in various ways, making the audit process last for four months. After the investigation, they clamored to the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Consultative Committee, "applying for reconsideration." After the anti-奸商 struggle began, they still did not confess their crimes properly. The facts prove that Shanghai's industrial and commercial businesses are extremely rampant in their attacks on the national tax authorities. Many of them are unwilling to obey the laws of the People's Government, do not recognize the leadership of the working class, and violate the Common Program. Their serious acts of evading national taxes have weakened the strength to support the front lines, damaged the country's economic construction, and seriously harmed the interests of the people. For more than two years, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, with the assistance of the working class and the broad masses of the people, has resolutely struggled against illegal capitalists and severely punished those who are particularly刁顽 (obstinate) and shameless according to law. Some奸商 with heinous crimes, such as Gu Peisheng, the owner of Yao Jixing, have been sentenced to death. Now the struggle against 奸商 in Shanghai has been fully launched. The People's Government and shop employees and workers have set up an airtight dragnet in all directions. Capitalists who have evaded taxes in the past must quickly and thoroughly confess, otherwise they will be severely sanctioned by the people's law.

    上海工商户逃税行为严重
    政府和店员工人已张好天罗地网，逃税的资本家如不彻底坦白，就将受到严厉制裁
    【新华社上海十七日电】解放以来，上海市工商界逃税偷税的行为极为严重。从一九四九年五月到一九五一年年底，上海市税务局已查出依法处理的案件有十五万五千八百五十六件之多，逃漏税款总数在二千六百亿元以上，最近检举或坦白出来的材料还不包括在内（未查出的应当比这个数目多好几倍）。如果拿这二千六百多亿元来发展工业，可以开办近三个拥有三万纱锭设备齐全的纱厂；如果购买武器，可以买到战斗机一百七十多架；如果建造工人住宅，可以安顿五口之家的工人家庭一万户。
    上海市逃税的工商业户极为普遍。一九五零年缴过第一期营业税后，市税务局曾抽查了三百五十一家纳税户，发现其中逃税户竟占百分之九十九左右。同年春季，市税务局又举行了一次全市性的大查账，在抽查过程中，发现全市二百七十多个行业内，脚踏车、钢铁炼制及造漆等五十多个行业的纳税户全体都犯不同程度的逃税行为。
    造假账是上海工商业户普遍采用的逃税手法。一九五零年六、七、八月工商业税评议后，市税务局对米商业进行了一次查账，调查七十七家的结果，发现其中造假账逃税的有六十七家，逃税户数几占被查户数的百分之八十八。不法资本家造假账的手法是十分狡猾的。日晖东路有一家孙庆记柴行的老板对着税务干部大跳大闹说：“我的账保险无问题，像你们这样查来查去，日晖东路家家都要关门。”后来税务局人员到该行突击检查，发现一本奇怪的学习手册，里面所写的是一些“龙”“凤”“虎”“蓬”等字样和一些数字。追问时奸商还狡赖说是学习手册，后来严词质询，他才承认记的就是暗账。有些奸商在造假账时还暴露了他们极端反动的思想。黄浦区老合兴华洋杂货号的老板在造暗账逃漏税款二亿九千多万元时，假开两个客户的姓名：一个是“陶光荣”，意即“逃税光荣”；另一个是“蒋国民”，意即“蒋匪的国民”。
    上海工商业户逃税的另一种方法是钻空子。一九五零年夏季税务局举办存货补税时，有些商人把各种原料都进行了登记。但自税务局公告自用原料免补货物税后，有些奸商就大钻空子，把许多非自用原料都说成是自用原料，已经补了税的也假说是自用原料而要求退税。协兴翻砂厂前一天以自用原料为由退了税，第二天却在市场上出卖生铁二吨。不仅如此，许多资本家有计划有组织地进行集体逃税。如五金商业同业公会主任委员、利泰祥五金号老板翁敏如就曾打着“进步”幌子，干了集体逃税的罪恶勾当。一九五零年八月间，他曾勾结同业顺昌泰、瑞昌两五金号从香港进货，假借自备外汇为名，由上海汇款到广州并派人往广州、香港洽购货物。在货物运抵上海后，他便假借行商名义，开立白发票入账，虚抬进货成本，隐匿原始凭证，掩饰其进口交易事实，因而偷漏了巨额所得税。一九四九年至一九五零年间，他又勾结几家同业，串同天津华贸进出口行，利用三个行商名义，用同样手段掩饰其营业真情，并将利润转入呆账，不仅逃避了大量资金，而且使国家税收遭受了巨大损失。有些奸商不仅大肆逃漏自己应缴的税款，并且把代扣代缴的行商税也吞没了。上海鱼市场一百二十个经纪人中即有三十一人侵吞了行商税，侵吞总数共达五十多亿元之巨。
    上海市不法工商业户不但偷漏国税的数字惊人，而且顽强地抗拒人民政府的检查，阻挠店员职工协助政府收税。如民丰、丰华两造纸厂在一九五零年一年中即逃漏了应纳税款达一百一十八亿二千二百多万元，这个逃漏数目是骇人听闻的。去年税务局发现该两造纸厂账册混乱派员前往检查时，该两造纸厂资方多方进行阻挠，使查账过程历时四月之久，查出后又向市人民政府及市协商委员会叫嚣，“申请复议”。反奸商斗争开始后，他们仍不好好坦白认罪。事实证明：上海市工商业户对国家税务机关的进攻极为猖狂，他们中有许多人不愿服从人民政府的法令，不承认工人阶级的领导地位，违背了共同纲领。他们的严重的偷漏国税行为削弱了支援前线的力量，损害了国家的经济建设，严重损害了人民利益。两年多来，上海市人民政府依靠工人阶级和广大人民群众的协助，坚决和不法资本家斗争，对特别刁顽无耻的便依法严办，有些罪大恶极的奸商如尧记兴老板顾培生等且被判处死刑。现在上海市反对奸商的斗争已全面开展，人民政府和店员工人已经四面八方布置好了天罗地网，过去逃税的资本家必须赶快彻底坦白，否则就将受到人民法律的严厉制裁。
