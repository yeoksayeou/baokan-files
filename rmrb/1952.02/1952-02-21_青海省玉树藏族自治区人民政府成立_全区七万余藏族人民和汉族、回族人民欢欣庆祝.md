Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 20th: Xining Dispatch: The People's Government of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province was officially established on February 12th. Over 70,000 Tibetan people and the few Han and Hui people residing in the area are all elated. On the morning of the 12th, Jiegu City, where the autonomous region's People's Government is located, was adorned with national flags and colorful lanterns, creating a festive atmosphere. Herdsmen from distant places also crossed snow-covered mountains and grasslands, joyfully rushing to attend the founding assembly of the regional autonomous government. At the meeting, the Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Zhaxi Caiwang Duojie (Tibetan), Vice Chairmen Ji Chunguang (Secretary of the Yushu Local Committee of the Communist Party of China), Jiumei (Tibetan), and Angwang (Tibetan) solemnly swore to Chairman Mao and the people of the entire region: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we, the Tibetan people of Yushu, have obtained a happy life. From now on, we will resolutely serve the people of Yushu wholeheartedly and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Yushu under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the higher-level People's Government!"

Vice Chairman Jiumei, on behalf of the Autonomous Region People's Government, reported to the assembly on future work tasks. Jiumei pointed out: The central task of the Autonomous Region People's Government in the future is to respond to Chairman Mao's call, practice thrift and increase production, and develop the political, economic, and cultural construction of the Tibetan people. Jiumei called on all herdsmen in the region to launch a large-scale patriotic movement to protect and increase livestock, vigorously organize sideline production such as hunting and medicinal herb gathering, and resolutely complete the task of increasing grain production by one million catties.

Xing Min, Minister of the Organization Department of the Yushu District Committee of the Communist Party of China, also spoke at the meeting. He called on all Communist Party members and Tibetan people in the region to unite closely and cooperate wholeheartedly to strive to build a new Yushu for the people.

At the meeting, Zhaxi Caiwang Duojie, Ji Chunguang, Jiumei, and Angwang, Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Autonomous Region People's Government, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on behalf of all Tibetan people in the region to express their respect. The assembly also sent telegrams to the Dalai Lama, Bainqen Erdini, and all Tibetan people in Tibet to express congratulations.

Note: The Yushu area is located in the southern part of Qinghai Province and governs the three counties of Yushu, Chengduo, and Nangqian, which are entirely nomadic areas. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Tibetan people in the area have gradually eliminated the disunity formed among various tribes during the era of national oppression, and have become increasingly friendly and cooperative. Mobile trade teams of state-owned trading organizations and medical teams of the People's Government frequently go deep into tents to purchase local products and supply necessities to herdsmen, and provide free medical treatment to herdsmen. The people of the entire region are beginning to move towards a happy life of "prosperity for both people and livestock." After the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for Tibetan Regional Autonomy in the Yushu area in July of last year, the preparatory committee's propaganda team promoted the national policy of implementing national regional autonomy to the Tibetan people of 24 tribes, further enhancing the Tibetan people's understanding of the Communist Party and the People's Government. All Tibetan people in the region unanimously support the government's policy of national regional autonomy and actively assist the People's Government in completing various preparatory work.

    青海省玉树藏族自治区人民政府成立
    全区七万余藏族人民和汉族、回族人民欢欣庆祝
    【新华社西安二十日电】西宁讯：青海省玉树藏族自治区人民政府已在二月十二日正式成立。全区七万余藏族人民和少数居住在该区的汉族、回族人民莫不欢欣鼓舞。十二日早晨，自治区人民政府所在地结古市，到处高悬国旗，张灯结彩，一片节日气象。远地的牧民也跨过雪山草原，兴高采烈地赶来参加区域自治政府的成立大会。会上，自治区人民政府主席扎喜才旺多杰（藏族）、副主席冀春光
    （中国共产党玉树地方委员会书记）、久美（藏族）、昂旺（藏族）向毛主席和全区人民庄严宣誓：“我们玉树藏族人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，已获得幸福的生活。今后，我们坚决在毛主席、共产党和上级人民政府领导下，全心全意为玉树人民服务，为建设繁荣幸福的新玉树而奋斗！”
    副主席久美代表自治区人民政府向大会报告今后工作任务。久美指出：自治区人民政府今后的中心任务，是响应毛主席的号召，厉行增产节约，发展藏族人民的政治经济文化等各项建设事业。久美号召全区牧民大规模地开展保护牲畜和增殖牲畜的爱国增产运动，并大力组织狩猎和挖药材等副业生产，坚决完成增产粮食一百万斤的任务。
    中国共产党玉树地委会组织部部长邢敏也在会上讲话。他号召全区共产党员和藏族人民亲密地团结合作，全心全意为建设人民的新玉树而奋斗。
    会上，自治区人民政府主席扎喜才旺多杰、副主席冀春光、久美、昂旺代表全区藏民电毛主席致敬。大会同时致电达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼及西藏全体藏民表示庆贺。
    按：玉树区在青海省南部，辖玉树、称多、囊谦三县，完全是游牧地区。两年来，该区藏族人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，逐渐消除了各部落在民族压迫时代形成的不团结现象，日渐友好互助。国营贸易机关的流动贸易组和人民政府的医疗队，经常深入帐篷，向牧民收购土产和供应必需品，并免费替牧民治病。全区人民开始走向“人畜两旺”的幸福生活。去年七月玉树区藏族区域自治筹备委员会成立以后，筹委会的宣传队向二十四个部落的藏民宣传了推行民族区域自治的民族政策，进一步提高了藏族人民对共产党和人民政府的认识。全区藏民一致拥护政府的民族区域自治政策并积极协助人民政府完成了各项筹备工作。
