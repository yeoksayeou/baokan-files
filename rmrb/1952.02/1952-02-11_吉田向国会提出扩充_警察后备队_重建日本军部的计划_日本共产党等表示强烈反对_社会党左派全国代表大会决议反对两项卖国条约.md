Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Yoshida publicly declared on January 31st in the House of Representatives Budget Committee that the Japanese government has decided to follow the United States' plan to rearm Japan, and is prepared to further expand and reorganize the "Police Reserve Force" to rebuild the Japanese military. Yoshida's statement caused a shock in the Diet and was opposed by opposition parties.

As revealed by Yoshida in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the Japanese government plans to submit "necessary bills" to the current Diet, and under the pretext of "reforming administrative institutions," will establish a "Security Agency" or "Defense Agency" in October of this year. At the same time, the "Police Reserve Force" will be reorganized into a "purely military-style" so-called "Defense Force." In other words, it will revive the Japanese military and regular army. According to the Yoshida government's plan, the "Police Reserve Force" will first be increased from 75,000 to 110,000 in September of this year. On this basis, the "Police Reserve Force" will be reorganized into the "Defense Force," and the heavy weapons supplied by the United States will be increased. Not only that, according to Kyodo News, the "future goal" of the Yoshida government is to establish an army of 250,000 (15 divisions), a navy of 50,000, and warships of 300,000 tons.

The expenses of the "Security Agency" or "Defense Agency" will be paid from the "various security expenses" in the 1952 budget, amounting to 56 billion yen. This newly established "agency" will be headed by a dedicated minister directly under the command of the Prime Minister. As everyone knows, incumbent State Minister Takeo Ohashi has already begun to assume this position. The new "agency" will govern the "Naval and Land Defense Forces," and will establish districts according to the former Japanese military administration divisions, and assign "Defense Forces" to be stationed. The organization of the "Defense Force" will also restore the organizational structure of the former Japanese army, such as divisions and regiments. The actual command of the "Defense Force" will be in the hands of the U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan. According to Kyodo News, regarding the so-called "defense of the homeland," the Japanese Prime Minister will maintain "close contact" with the "U.S.-Japan Joint Committee" and be "responsible for managing and commanding the Defense Force."

The Yoshida government's rearmament plan immediately aroused opposition and dissatisfaction in the Japanese Diet. According to Kyodo News, the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the left wing of the Socialist Party, and most of the members of the First Club, "strongly opposed the establishment of the Defense Force from the front." Even within the conservative Ryokufukai, some people opposed this plan. Many members of the Diet are prepared to question Yoshida in the Diet.

Several opposition parties have issued statements denouncing Yoshida's plan. The left wing of the Socialist Party issued a statement saying that the Yoshida government is "violating the peaceful constitution, deceiving peace-loving people," and "advancing on the road to war." The statement advocates "investigating the responsibility of the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet and demanding its resignation." The right wing of the Socialist Party also issued a statement saying that Yoshida's statement "exposed the conspiracy to make the reserve force a seedbed for rearmament." The statement claimed that the party "will wage a resolute struggle against this blind and dictatorial plan of the Yoshida government." Kawasaki, chairman of the National Democratic Party's Diet Policy Committee, pointed out in a speech that Yoshida's statement "ultimately exposed the government's consistent claim that it would not rearm. This evasive tactic can no longer deceive the people."

This situation shows that the Yoshida government's request for the Diet to approve its rearmament plan will encounter serious difficulties, especially in the House of Councillors, where the Liberal Party has failed to secure a majority of seats. Kyodo News acknowledged that, based on "the current situation," "it would be dangerous to assume that the absolute majority of Councilors unconditionally agree to the establishment of a self-defense force. The situation does not seem optimistic for the government."

Tass News Agency, 7th. Dispatch: The Japanese people are increasingly resolutely protesting against the Yoshida reactionary government's policy of violating national interests, which will cause Japan to lose its independence and wants to turn Japan into a military base for U.S. imperialism. This protest is particularly manifested in many resolutions of the National Congress of the Left Wing of the Japanese Socialist Party, held in Tokyo from January 28th to January 30th. Although the upper-level leaders of the Socialist Party's left wing tried to defend the separate peace treaty signed in San Francisco, the majority of representatives attending the meeting, reflecting the sentiments of the party members, advocated fighting for the complete abolition of the San Francisco Treaty.

Radio Tokyo pointed out: The atmosphere in favor of abolishing the treaty clearly prevailed in the venue.

A resolution was passed at the meeting, advocating intensifying the struggle to uphold peace and national independence and oppose the rearmament of Japan. The conference also decided to launch a mass movement to oppose the San Francisco Treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to demand the conclusion of an all-round peace treaty.

In a special declaration, the conference condemned the Yoshida government's rearmament of Japan and its intention to recognize the Kuomintang reactionary remnants.

    吉田向国会提出扩充“警察后备队”重建日本军部的计划
    日本共产党等表示强烈反对
    社会党左派全国代表大会决议反对两项卖国条约
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：日本反动政府首相吉田于一月三十一日在众院预算委员会公开声明：日本政府决定遵照美国重新武装日本的计划，准备进一步扩充并改编“警察后备队”，重建日本军部。吉田的声明在国会中引起了震动，并遭到在野党派的反对。
    据吉田在众院预算委员会透露，日本政府预定向本届国会提出“必要的法案”，在“改革行政机构”的藉口下，在今年十月间设立“保安省”或“国防省”，同时将“警察后备队”改编为“纯军队式”的所谓“防卫队”。换言之，也就是复活日本的军部和正规陆军。根据吉田政府的计划，首先在今年九月间将“警察后备队”从七万五千名增加到十一万名，在这个基础上，将“警察后备队”改编为“防卫队”，并增加由美国供给的重武器装备。不仅如此，据共同社透露，吉田政府“将来的目标”是建立陆军二十五万人（十五个师），海军五万人，军舰三十万吨。
    “保安省”或“国防省”的经费将从一九五二年度预算中数达五百六十亿日元的“各项安全保障费”支付。这个新设“省”将由为首相所直接指挥的专任大臣负责。大家知道，现任国务相大桥武夫实际上已在开始担任这一职务。新设“省”将统辖
    “海、陆防卫队”，并将根据以前的日本军管区分设管区，分派“防卫队”驻扎。“防卫队”的编制也恢复前日军的师团、联队之类的编制。“防卫队”的实际指挥权将操在驻日美军当局的手中。据共同社透露，关于所谓“防卫国土”的事宜，日本首相将与“美日联合委员会”取得“密切的联系”，“负责管理和指挥防卫队”。
    吉田政府这一重新武装计划透露后，立即在日本国会中引起了反对和不满的情绪。据共同社讯，共产党、劳农党、社会党左派，以及第一俱乐部的大部分议员，都“从正面强烈地反对成立防卫队”。甚至保守的绿风会的内部也有一部分人反对这一计划。许多议员已准备在国会中向吉田提出质询。
    若干在野党派已发表声明，斥责吉田的计划。社会党左派发表声明说：吉田政府“违反和平宪法，欺骗爱好和平的人”，“向战争的道路前进”。声明主张“追究反动吉田内阁的责任，要求它下台。”社会党右派也发表声明说：吉田的声明“暴露了要使后备队成为重整军备的苗床的阴谋”。声明声称该党“对吉田政府的这种盲目而且独裁的计划要作坚决的斗争”。国民民主党国会对策委员会主席川崎发表谈话指出：吉田的声明“终究暴露了政府一向声称不重整军备的马脚。这种逃遁的策略，已经不能够欺瞒国民了。”
    这种情况说明：吉田政府要求国会批准它的重新武装计划，将遭到严重的困难，特别是在自由党未能掌握多数议席的参院。共同社承认：根据“目前的情况”，“如果认为绝对多数的参议员无条件地赞成建立自卫队，那是很危险的。对政府来说，形势似乎并不允许乐观。”
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社讯：日本人民越来越坚决地抗议吉田反动政府违反民族利益的政策，这种政策将使日本失去独立，并且想把日本变为美帝国主义的军事基地。这种抗议特别表现在从一月二十八日到一月三十日在东京举行的日本社会党左派全国代表大会的许多决议里。虽然社会党左派的上层领袖们努力辩护在旧金山签字的单独和约，但是反映该党党员群众情绪的到会的大多数代表，都主张要为完全废除旧金山和约而斗争。
    东京电台指出：赞成废约的空气在会场上显然占着上风。
    会上通过决议，主张加紧进行拥护和平与民族独立以及反对日本重新武装的斗争。大会并决定发动群众运动，反对旧金山和约和美日“安全条约”，要求订立全面和约。
    大会在一项特别宣言中谴责吉田政府重新武装日本以及想要承认国民党反动残余集团的打算。
