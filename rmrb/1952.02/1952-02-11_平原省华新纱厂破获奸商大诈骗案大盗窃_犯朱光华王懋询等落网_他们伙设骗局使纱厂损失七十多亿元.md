The privately and publicly owned Jixian Huaxin Textile Co., Ltd. (hereafter referred to as Huaxin Yarn Factory) in Pingyuan Province has uncovered a huge fraud case. Wang Maoxun, a private shareholder and director of the factory, Wang Xinpu, the managing director and acting manager, Chen Yunong, the vice chairman of the board, and other accomplices colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Zhu Guanghua to conspire and defraud the factory of funds allocated for placing orders, causing the factory to suffer a loss of 7,268,000,000 yuan. These thieves have been arrested by the People's Government in Shanghai, Xinxiang, Kaifeng, and other locations.

At the second meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of Huaxin Yarn Factory in November 1950, it was decided through consultation between the public and private sectors to expand production and purchase an additional 10,000 spindles. After the meeting, Wang Maoxun and Wang Xinpu went to Shanghai on business. On their way through Kaifeng, they contacted the unscrupulous merchant Zhu Guanghua, informing him that the factory intended to add 10,000 spindles. Zhu Guanghua, burdened by foreign debt, was searching everywhere for speculative ventures. Thus, Zhu Guanghua and Wang Maoxun jointly devised a scheme. They decided to use the name "Dayi Machine Manufacturing Factory" to solicit the order. This "Dayi Machine Manufacturing Factory" was, in reality, an empty shell without registration with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and without a factory address, machinery, capital, or workers. They intended to defraud Huaxin Yarn Factory of a huge sum of money for orders before even setting up the factory. Their agreement stipulated that if the scheme succeeded, Zhu Guanghua would give Wang Maoxun and others 114 bales of cotton yarn, and would also allow Wang Maoxun to recommend three key personnel, such as accountants, once his "factory" started operations. Later, they brought in Chen Yunong, agreeing that the benefits would be shared equally if the scheme succeeded.

After the scheme was arranged, this group of thieves began their activities. First, Wang Maoxun, in his capacity as a private shareholder and director, wrote from Shanghai recommending the "Dayi Machine Manufacturing Factory," claiming that "Dayi machines are of excellent quality, quoted at lower prices, and delivered earlier." He also sent more expensive quotation sheets from several Shanghai manufacturers and introduced Qin Jiyuan, the "manager" of "Dayi," to the factory for negotiations. The leading cadres of Huaxin Yarn Factory, plagued by severe bureaucratic tendencies, did not conduct any investigations with relevant authorities in Shanghai. Based solely on Wang Maoxun's introduction, they first signed a contract with "Dayi" for 14 carding machines. Of course, the so-called "Dayi Machine Manufacturing Factory" did not possess any carding machines. To gain the trust of Huaxin Yarn Factory, Zhu Guanghua delivered 14 carding machines that a certain yarn factory was about to sell. Subsequently, Zhu Guanghua, through Chen Yunong's introduction, negotiated with the yarn factory to undertake the project of 10,000 spindles. Chen Yunong praised Zhu Guanghua, saying, "Mr. Zhu is an experienced and reputable figure in the Shanghai textile industry."

The bureaucratic tendencies of the leading cadres of Huaxin Yarn Factory were extremely serious. During the signing of contracts with these unscrupulous merchants Zhu Guanghua and Qin Jiyuan, when their true colors were already revealed, they did not investigate. When signing the contract, they did not investigate machine prices. After the contract was signed, they paid huge deposits without checking the guarantor. In the draft contract, the person in charge of "Dayi" was Qin Jiyuan, while Zhu Guanghua became the so-called "guarantor." When the factory leaders raised questions, Wang Xinpu vehemently defended Zhu Guanghua, saying that "Zhu cannot come forward due to excessive foreign debts." Huaxin Yarn Factory believed this without further investigation. When the draft contract was submitted to the relevant departments of the Industry Department of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government for review, the reviewing unit suggested that the payment amount specified in the contract was too high, the delivery time was too long, and should be modified, while strictly specifying the quality, and proposing a definite guarantee. At that time, Wang Xinpu expressed dissatisfaction and complained, while secretly plotting with Zhu Guanghua to slightly modify the contract, making necessary concessions in form to facilitate the scheme. The factory did not carefully investigate the machine prices and was greatly deceived by Zhu Guanghua. At that time, the East China Industry Department ordered carding machines from Shanghai Taili Machine Manufacturing Factory at 75.3 million yuan per unit, while Huaxin Yarn Factory ordered them at 100.24 million yuan per unit. The price differences for other spinning machines and cone winding machines were also significant. The formal contract was signed on March 19th of last year. The contract included 25 spinning machines, 30 carding machines (later an additional 6 were ordered), and 20 cone winding machines, totaling 9,056,000,000 yuan, to be fully delivered by the end of September 1951. After the contract was signed, Zhu Guanghua, citing "securing steel materials to avoid the impact of material price fluctuations on contract execution" as the reason, requested an advance payment of 60%. At this time, Zhu Guanghua had not yet found a guarantor or a supervisor; however, due to Wang Xinpu's strong support, Huaxin Yarn Factory agreed to his unreasonable request and paid Zhu Guanghua a deposit of 5,433,600,000 yuan. Afterwards, Zhu Guanghua sent the guarantee letter from Shanghai, and Huaxin Yarn Factory did not contact the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, nor did they send anyone to verify the guarantee and understand the guarantor's situation. After receiving the deposit, Zhu Guanghua withdrew 100 million yuan as capital, preparing to deceive the government and apply for the registration of "Dayi Factory," but he was unsuccessful.

In June of last year, the private shareholders, directors, and supervisors of Huaxin Yarn Factory entrusted Chen Yunong and Wang Xinpu to go to Shanghai to understand the manufacturing situation of "Dayi" orders, and again ordered six carding machines from "Dayi," paying a deposit of 84%, totaling over 490 million yuan. After this contract was signed, Chen, Wang, and others demanded "benefits" of 120 million yuan from Zhu Guanghua (including expenses and gifts given by Chen and Wang in Shanghai). At this time, Chen Yunong and Wang Xinpu brought their wives to Shanghai, staying at the International Hotel and spending lavishly. However, when Wang Xinpu reported to the factory, he said: "The material procurement, work situation, and factory condition of Dayi are all good, with no concerns," and "Delivery will not be delayed."

On July 3rd of last year, the Shanghai industrial and commercial community discovered that "Dayi" had not completed the formal business procedures and ordered it to cease operations. On July 4th, Zhu Guanghua hurriedly ran to Huaxin Yarn Factory, using the pretext of modifying some parts to a larger size, demanding to advance the payment of another 15% of the goods. Although Wang Xinpu already knew that "Dayi" had been shut down, he still strongly supported Zhu's unreasonable request, causing the factory to pay another 1,280,000,000 yuan. By this time, Zhu Guanghua had received 7,205,120,000 yuan in payments from Huaxin Yarn Factory, and Huaxin Yarn Factory still had no idea about this scheme. In early August of last year, after the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce revealed the scheme, Huaxin Yarn Factory realized they had been deceived. After a detailed investigation, thieves Wang Maoxun, Wang Xinpu, Chen Yunong, Zhu Guanghua, Qin Jiyuan, and others were arrested.

The losses suffered by Huaxin Yarn Factory due to this scheme are severe. To this day, six of the ordered carding machines have not been delivered, and parts for the spinning machines have not been delivered in full. The average delivery delay is more than 162 days. The original contract stipulated that "all deliveries will be completed within seven months from the date of order" and "formal delivery will be considered after the installation and test run are deemed qualified." That is to say, all test runs should have been completed and spinning started by October 19th of last year. However, in reality, the first spinning machine only started spinning on January 4th of this year, and all 25 spinning machines will only start spinning on May 7th of this year. Due to the delayed delivery, Huaxin Yarn Factory suffered serious losses. First, the factory could not complete the production tasks assigned by the state on time, resulting in a shortfall of 4,610 bales of 20-count cotton yarn. Second, the loss of funds and labor due to the delayed delivery of the yarn machines amounted to 7,268,000,000 yuan. The losses caused by inconsistent machine specifications, which made installation difficult and wasted manpower, have not yet been calculated. When this scheme was revealed, the employees of Huaxin Yarn Factory were extremely angry. They said that the workers, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, treated the factory as a battlefield, working hard in production, and not allowing any waste. They were reluctant to throw away even a bit of fly waste or a scrap of yarn. Last year, in the fourth quarter, they worked hard for three months and managed to increase production and save 900,000 jin of grain. However, these capitalists, as shareholders of the factory, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, causing the factory to lose more than 7 billion yuan in one fell swoop. Everyone demanded that the government severely punish them according to the law and recover the losses from them.

    平原省华新纱厂破获奸商大诈骗案大盗窃
    犯朱光华王懋询等落网
    他们伙设骗局使纱厂损失七十多亿元
    平原省公私合营的汲县华新纺织股份有限公司（下简称华新纱厂）破获了巨大的诈骗案。这个厂的私股董事王懋询、常务董事兼代经理王欣甫、副董事长陈韵浓等结伙勾结奸商朱光华，伙设骗局，诳骗这个厂的定货资金，使这个厂遭受损失七十二亿六千八百多万元。这一伙盗窃犯已分别在上海、新乡、开封等地被人民政府逮捕。
    华新纱厂在一九五○年十一月的第二次董、监事会议上，经公私双方协商，决定扩大生产，增购纱锭一万锭。会后王懋询、王欣甫因事去上海。路经开封时，他们就找到奸商朱光华，告诉他厂里要增加一万纱锭。朱光华正因外债压头，到处找投机买卖。于是由朱光华和王懋询共同商定骗局。他们商定，以所谓“大毅机器制造厂”为名，兜揽这批定货。这个“大毅机器制造厂”实际上是一个既没有向上海市工商局登记，又没有厂址、机器、资金和工人的空架子。他们妄图骗得华新纱厂的定货巨款以后再办工厂。他们之间的条件是，骗局成功后，朱光华给王懋询等棉纱一百一十四件，同时允许等到他的“工厂”开工后，由王懋询推荐会计等重要职员三人。以后，他们又拉进了陈韵浓，谈妥骗局成功后，好处大家均分。
    骗局布置好后，这一伙盗窃分子就开始进行活动。首先，王懋询以私股董事的资格由上海来信，推荐“大毅机器制造厂”，说什么“大毅机器品质优良，报价较廉，交货日期较早”。同时寄来上海几家厂商的较贵的纱机报单，并介绍“大毅”的“经理”秦济元到厂接洽。华新纱厂的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，他们没向上海有关方面进行调查，仅凭王懋询的介绍，就先和“大毅”订了十四台梳棉机的合同。当然，所谓“大毅机器制造厂”是并没有梳棉机的。朱光华为了骗取华新纱厂的信任，便拿某纱厂正要出卖的十四台梳棉机如期交给了华新纱厂。接着，朱光华经陈韵浓介绍到纱厂商谈承做一万锭子的问题。陈韵浓为朱光华吹擂，说“朱先生是上海纺织界有经验有声望的人物”。
    华新纱厂的领导干部的官僚主义作风十分严重。在和朱光华、秦济元这些奸商签定合同中，这些人的狐狸尾巴已经露了出来，他们也不追查。签订合同时，不调查机器价格，合同订好后，不查对铺保就付出巨额定款。在合同草约上，“大毅”的负责人是秦济元，朱光华则成了所谓“保人”。厂方负责人提出疑问后，王欣甫便极力替朱光华诡辩，说“朱因欠外债过多，不便出名”。华新纱厂对这竟深信不疑，不再追究。当合同草约交平原省人民政府工业厅有关部门审查时，审查单位提出合同中规定的付款额较高，交货时间太长，应加修改，同时应严格注明质量，并提出确实保证。当时，王欣甫一面表示不满，大发牢骚；一面又同朱光华密谋把合同略加修改，在形式上作必要的让步，以便促成骗局。对于机器价格，厂方没有作仔细调查，也受了朱光华很大的骗。当时华东工业部定购上海泰利机器制造厂的梳棉机每台七千五百三十万元；华新纱厂所定的则是每台一亿零二百四十万元。其他细纱机筒子机的差价也都很大。正式的合同在去年三月十九日签订。合同包括：细纱机二十五台，梳棉机三十台（后又续定六台），筒子机二十台，共计价九十亿五千六百万元，定一九五一年九月底全部缴齐。合同订好后，朱光华以“掌握钢料免受物料价格涨落影响合同执行”为理由，要求先付定款百分之六十。这时朱光华还没找好铺保和监证；可是由于王欣甫的极力支持，华新纱厂竟答应了他的无理要求，付给朱光华定款五十四亿三千三百六十万元。事后朱光华把保证书由上海寄来，华新纱厂也没有和上海市人民政府取得联系，并派人去对保和了解保人的情况。朱光华拿到定款后，从中抽出一亿元作为资金，准备欺骗政府，办理“大毅厂”的登记手续，但没有成功。
    去年六月间，华新纱厂私股董、监事又委托陈韵浓、王欣甫到上海了解“大毅”定货制造情况，并再次向“大毅”定制了六台梳棉机，付定款百分之八十四，计四亿九千多万元。这次合同签订后，陈、王等就向朱光华索要“好处”一亿二千万元（陈、王等在上海花费及送礼在外）。这时陈韵浓、王欣甫便把老婆接到上海，住在国际饭店，大肆挥霍。而王欣甫向厂里做报告时，却说：“大毅购料问题、工作情形、工厂情况都尚好，无什么顾虑”，“交货也不至延期”。
    去年七月三日，上海市工商界查明“大毅”没有办理正式营业手续，令它停业。七月四日，朱光华仓皇跑到华新纱厂，以某些机件改大为藉口，要求再提前交付百分之十五的货款。王欣甫虽已知道“大毅”被停业，但仍然极力支持朱的无理要求，使厂方又付给货款十二亿八千万元。到这时候，朱光华已从华新纱厂领得七十二亿零五百十二万元货款，华新纱厂对于这个骗局仍然根本没有察觉。去年八月初，上海市工商局向他们揭发了骗局情况后，华新纱厂才知道上了当，经过详细调查，把王懋询、王欣甫、陈韵浓、朱光华、秦济元等盗窃犯分别逮捕。
    这次骗局，华新纱厂受到的损失是严重的。直到现在为止，所订梳棉机还有六台没有交货，细纱机上的零件也没有交全。交货延期平均一百六十二天多。原合同规定“定货之日起七个月全部交清”，
    “安装试车认为合格后为正式交货”，这就是说，应该在去年十月十九日全部试车合格开纺。但实际上，第一部细纱机开纺时间就到了今年一月四日，二十五台细纱机全部开纺要到今年五月七日。由于交货延期，使华新纱厂遭受了严重损失。首先，使这个厂不能按时完成国家所给予的生产任务，少产二十支棉纱四千六百一十件。其次，因纱机延交，而积压资金和劳动力的损失，共七十二亿六千八百多万元。机器规格不一致，使安装困难浪费人工所招致的损失，还没有计算出来。当这个骗局被揭露后，华新纱厂的职工们愤怒万分。他们说，工人们响应毛主席增产节约的号召，把工厂当做战场，紧张生产，一点浪费都不许有，一点飞花一点纱头都舍不得扔掉，去年第四季辛辛苦苦干了三个月，好容易增产节约了九十万斤粮食。而这些资本家身为本厂股东，竟然勾结奸商，一下就使厂里损失了七十多亿元。大家要求政府对他们依法严惩，并向他们追回损失。
