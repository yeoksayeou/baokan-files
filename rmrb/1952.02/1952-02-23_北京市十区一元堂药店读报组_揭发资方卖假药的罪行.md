    Beijing Tenth District Yiyuantang Pharmacy Reading Group
    Exposes the Crime of Capitalists Selling Fake Medicine
    To the Editor: After reading the news in the "Reading Group Activities" column of the People's Daily about the Beijing Sixth District pharmacy employees exposing the crime of capitalists selling fake medicine, we were extremely indignant. We knew about the illegal behavior of capitalists selling fake medicine. However, in the past, we always had some concerns, fearing that if we exposed this matter, the capitalists might retaliate, and we might lose our jobs. After a period of reading and learning, especially after seeing the news reports in the newspapers about shop employees in various places actively participating in the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, and the concrete facts that the People's Government supported and stood up for the employees, we began to change our mistaken ideas. We are no longer willing to see those who work hard every day and get sick, using their long-term savings to buy some fake medicine that is worthless!
    We want to expose to you the criminal activities of our store (Yiyuantang) and certain pharmacies in the Tenth District in selling fake medicine. When Yiyuantang prepares pills, they always use rhinoceros horn to replace antelope horn. Antelope horn costs 600,000 yuan per tael, while rhinoceros horn is only worth 200,000 yuan per tael. By substituting like this, the unscrupulous merchants make a profit of 200 percent. When preparing medicine, the unscrupulous merchants reduce the amount of fine medicinal materials such as bezoar, musk, antelope horn, and rhinoceros horn by two-thirds of the prescribed amount. The unscrupulous merchants also use safflower to replace safflower from southern China. Qing'antang sells nineteen kinds of medicinal pills, powders, and plasters, but labels them as thirty-four kinds, and writes "extra ingredients" on them. In reality, all medicines are made with shoddy materials and reduced quantities. The pills from Darentang do not contain any fine materials such as antelope horn, rhinoceros horn, pearl, or deer antler; most valuable pills are replaced with inferior goods, such as replacing Amber Baolong Pills with Bezoar Baolong Pills. Helingtang only has two kinds of water pills, but uses them to replace all kinds of pills, which is the height of deception and fraud.
    The above are just some examples that we are familiar with. There must be many more dark and serious things in the pharmaceutical industry. Editor, medicine is used to treat diseases, but these unscrupulous merchants, in order to seek exorbitant profits, have lost all conscience and use it to deceive patients and damage their health. How hateful this is! We ask the People's Government to thoroughly investigate and resolutely deal with the fraudulent behavior in the pharmaceutical industry in this anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement. We hope that all pharmacy employees across the country will take active action and boldly report the crimes of the capitalists.
    In addition, Liu Shoulun, the director of the Tenth District Chinese Medicine Industry Trade Union, accepted a bribe of 600,000 yuan from the capitalists before the New Year to obstruct our movement. We advised him to confess his mistakes frankly and return to the ranks of the working class, but he refused to confess and obstructed our reading and learning. We have already petitioned the Tenth District Shop Employees' Trade Union to remove him from his post.

### 北京市十区一元堂药店读报组  揭发资方卖假药的罪行

    北京市十区一元堂药店读报组
    揭发资方卖假药的罪行
    编辑同志：我们读了人民日报“读报组活动”栏刊出的北京六区药业店员揭发资方卖假药的罪行的消息，十分愤慨。资方卖假药的非法行为，我们是知道的。但过去总有一些顾虑，害怕揭穿了这件事，资本家可能报复，我们可能失业。经过一段时间的读报学习，尤其是看到报纸上报道的各地店员积极参加反行贿、反偷税漏税运动的消息，和人民政府给店员撑腰作主的具体事实，我们就开始改变了自己的错误想法。我们再也不愿意看见那些成天劳苦因而生病的人，拿着自己长期积蓄的钱去买一些分文不值的假药了！
    我们要向你们揭发本店（一元堂）及十区某些药店卖假药的罪恶勾当。一元堂配制丸药时，从来就是用西角顶替羚羊角。羚羊角每两六十万元，西角每两只值二十万元，这样偷梁换柱后，奸商获利达百分之二百；奸商配药时，凡牛黄、麝香、羚羊、西角等细料药，都按应配量减少三分之二；奸商还用草红花顶替南红花。庆安堂出售十九种药丸、药散、药膏，但却标成三十四种药名，并且写上加料货等字样，实际上全部药品都是偷工减料的。大仁堂的丸药，凡是应加细料如羚羊、西角、珍珠、鹿茸的，都一律不加；大部贵重丸药都以次货顶替，如以牛黄抱龙丸顶替琥珀抱龙丸等。鹤龄堂只有两种水丸，却用它顶替一切丸药，真是欺骗讹诈到了顶点。
    以上只是我们所熟知的一些例子。药业界比这更为黑暗更为严重的事情，一定还有很多。编辑同志，药是治病用的，但这些奸商为了贪图暴利，却丧尽天良，用它来欺骗病人，损害病人的健康。这多么可恨！我们要求人民政府在这次反行贿，反偷税漏税运动里，彻底检查和坚决处理药业界的欺诈行为。希望全国药业店员同志们积极行动起来，大胆地检举资方的罪恶。
    此外，我们第十区国药业店员工会的主任刘守伦，在年前受资方贿赂六十万元，阻碍我们的运动。我们劝他坦白认错，回到工人阶级的队伍中来，但他拒不坦白，并且阻挠我们读报学习，我们已经呈请第十区店员工会，把他撤职了。
