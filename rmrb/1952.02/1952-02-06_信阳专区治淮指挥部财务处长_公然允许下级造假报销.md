    Head of Finance Department of Xinyang Special District Flood Control Headquarters
    Openly Permits Subordinates to Falsify Reimbursements
    Editor: After the winter flood control project concluded, the Zhengyang County Flood Control Headquarters of Xinyang Special District had a surplus of flood prevention funds when settling accounts. Director Zhou of the Finance Department of the Xinyang Special District Flood Control Headquarters said to the Zhengyang County Flood Control Headquarters: "Whatever flood prevention funds you have left over, try to spend and get reimbursed; what's the point of just leaving them there?" So, Yuan Qingxiu, the head of the Finance Section of the County Flood Control Headquarters, and Wang Liqing, the head of the Secretarial Section, drew up a fake contract with Zhang Mingdao, the head of the Education Section of the County Public Security Bureau (the labor reform team led by the Education Section was operating a brick kiln). They also wrote a fake note stating the purchase of 1,800 pieces of flood prevention timber at 9,000 yuan each, and 1,500 bricks at 290 yuan each, totaling 20.055 million yuan. The Zhengyang County Flood Control Headquarters used this fake note for reimbursement. Subsequently, they used the money to build twelve new rooms, made forty-five new beds, and bought bicycles, enamel basins, tables, stools and other furniture, completely wasting all the remaining flood prevention funds.

    We believe that forging receipts to defraud the state's flood prevention funds for extravagant waste is a serious mistake and an illegal act. Currently, the leaders of the Zhengyang County People's Government and the County Public Security Bureau are conducting self-criticisms and requesting severe punishment from higher authorities. However, we believe that Director Zhou of the Finance Department of the Xinyang Special District Flood Control Headquarters, as a leading cadre responsible for managing state finances, not only failed to uphold the state's financial system but openly allowed the Zhengyang County Flood Control Headquarters to write fake receipts and falsify reimbursements. This is an extremely serious illegal act. We suggest that the relevant leading authorities immediately order Director Zhou of the Finance Department of the Xinyang Special District Flood Control Headquarters to thoroughly review this incident and give him the punishment he deserves.

    信阳专区治淮指挥部财务处长
    公然允许下级造假报销
    编辑同志：冬季治淮工程结束后，信阳专区正阳县治淮总队部结账时，剩余下一批防汛费。信阳专区治淮指挥部财务处周处长，对正阳县治淮总队部说：“你们的防汛费节余多少，尽量开支报销了算了，还放着它干什么？”于是，县治淮总队部财务科科长袁庆修、秘书科长王立青，就和县公安局管教股股长张明道订了一张假合同（管教股领导的劳动改造队开着烧砖窑），并写了一张假条子，写明代买防汛木材一千八百根，每根九千元；代买砖头一千五百块，每块二百九十元；合计二千零五十五万元。正阳县治淮总队部拿这张假条子报销。随后，就拿这笔款盖了十二间新房，做了四十五张新床，还买了自行车以及磁盆、桌、凳等家具，把剩余防汛费全部浪费光。
    我们认为造假条子骗取国家防汛费来铺张浪费，是严重的错误和犯法的行为。现在正阳县人民政府和县公安局领导方面正在作检讨，并请求上级给以严厉处分。但是我们认为信阳专区治淮指挥部财务处周处长，身为领导干部，又担负着掌握国家财政的重任，不但不坚持国家财政制度，反而公开让正阳县治淮总队部写假条子造假报销，这是极其严重的犯法行为。我们建议有关领导机关应立即责令信阳专区治淮指挥部财务处周处长彻底检讨这一事件，并应给他应得的处分。
