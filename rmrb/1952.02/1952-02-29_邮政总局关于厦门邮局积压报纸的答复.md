    Postal Administration's Reply Regarding the Accumulation of Newspapers at the Xiamen Post Office

    Comrade Editor: On December 4, 1951, the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily published Comrade Lu Xianhe's letter criticizing the Xiamen Post Office for its accumulation of People's Daily newspapers. The facts stated in the letter are completely correct.

    According to our investigation, the reason for the accumulation of newspapers at the Xiamen Post Office is the failure to properly manage transportation. Because mail and newspapers sent from Beijing to Xiamen have to go through transportation routes such as trains, automobiles, and ships, sometimes the timing is not coordinated; sometimes the automobile capacity is small, resulting in accumulation. Now, the postal offices along the way have initially improved this situation, and the situation where newspapers from three or four days or five or six days are delivered at once no longer exists, but there are still instances where newspapers from two or three days are delivered at the same time. We are further studying improvements.

### 邮政总局关于厦门邮局积压报纸的答复

    邮政总局关于厦门邮局积压报纸的答复
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月四日，人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了卢先和同志批评厦门邮局不应积压人民日报的来信，信中所说的事实是完全正确的。
    据我们调查，厦门邮局积压报纸的原因，是交通运输没有搞好。因为自北京寄厦门的邮件和报纸，中间要经过火车、汽车、轮船等运输路线，有时因为时间衔接不上；有时因为汽车运量小，结果就积压下来了。现在沿途邮局已经初步改善了这种情况，三、四天或五、六天的报纸一次送到的情形已经没有了，但有时仍有两三天的报纸同时送到的情形，我们正在进一步地研究改善。
