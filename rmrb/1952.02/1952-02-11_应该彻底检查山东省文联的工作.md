Reader's Letter

    To the Editor: When Comrade Yu Jiyu was in a leadership position at the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he displayed serious bureaucratic tendencies. Within the organization, there were serious phenomena of extravagance and waste, and a lack of distinction between public and private interests, causing great losses to the state. In 1950 alone, they held over three hundred banquets and feasts among themselves. In the spring of the same year, due to the profits earned from staging "Yu Tang Chun" (a Peking Opera), amounting to over 100 million yuan, the leadership actually allowed a person named Deng to do business in the Northeast. Later, they rented films in Shanghai at high prices, resulting in repeated losses and significant deficits. The situation in the Federation's warehouse was even more serious. Curtains, whole bolts of colored silk, and entire boxes of red cloth in the warehouse were damaged by mold and rats, resulting in incalculable losses. Many sweaters, overcoats, suits, rubber tires, etc., were stolen by the managers. Due to the lack of an inspection system, even entire boxes of red cloth disappeared after changing hands several times.

    The year before last, someone in the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles wrote a letter to the Government Administration Council, secretly reporting the embezzlement of Zhou Zhongyu, the Federation's secretary. The leadership of the Federation, upon learning of this matter, did not pursue the embezzlement crimes of the embezzler Zhou Zhongyu. Instead, they protected Zhou Zhongyu and investigated the motives and background of the letter writer. After Liu Zhixia became the Secretary-General of the Federation, he displayed cliquishness in the use of cadres. His ideological style has caused much dissatisfaction. The work of the Secretariat often depends on who is involved. In 1950, Liu Zhixia alone took nearly one-third of the relief grain for cadres' families. Liu Zhixia's relationship with private merchants was very unclean. He was very close to the "Imperial Palace" photo studio in Jinan, and he helped the "Imperial Palace" set up electric light advertisements on the Taiping Gate of the Da Guan Cinema, promoting it extensively and helping the "Imperial Palace" attract business. In this way, he could get some benefits when he took photos and developed pictures at the "Imperial Palace". He brought his brother, who was under supervision, from home and introduced him to work in the provincial government. This incident caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. When his wife gave birth and was hospitalized, three civil servants and a young girl took turns buying and delivering things; at home, there was also a mother-in-law and an administrator to assist. After his wife was discharged from the hospital, a nanny was added to serve her. His wife took leave for five months while pregnant, and after starting work after giving birth, her average working time did not exceed two hours per day.

    The leadership of the Federation does not pay attention to the use of literary and art cadres and the organization of creative activities of literary and art workers. Some literary and art workers here request to go to the countryside and to Korea to participate in mass struggles and get close to the life of the masses, but it is difficult to realize these requests, and even if someone can go out, it is considered a "special favor." On the other hand, the leading cadres, proceeding from their personal interests, let the main force of the Federation engage in Peking Opera and sent a special person to Suzhou to buy costumes.

    Comrade Feng Yizhi, the head of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department's Literary and Art Section, who directly leads the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has never seriously inspected the work of the Federation. His relationship with Liu Zhixia is abnormal. The two often eat and drink together, and he has also accepted gifts from Liu Zhixia. It is hoped that relevant parties will investigate this situation.

### 应该彻底检查山东省文联的工作

    应该彻底检查山东省文联的工作
    编辑同志：于寄愚同志在山东省文学艺术界联合会作领导工作时，有严重的官僚主义作风；机关内部有严重的铺张浪费、公私不分的现象，给国家造成很大损失。一九五零年，他们互相请客、吃喝，就有三百多次。同年春，由于上演“玉堂春”盈利
    一亿多元，领导方面竟让一个姓邓的人去东北作生意，后又用高价去上海租影片，一赔再赔，亏损很大。文联仓库的情况更严重。仓库里的幕布、整匹的彩绸、整箱的红布，被霉烂鼠咬，损失难以统计。许多毛衣、大衣、西装、胶带轮胎等，都被管理者盗窃了。因无检查制度，经过数次转手后，整箱红布也无下落。
    前年，山东文联机关中有人给政务院写信，密告文联秘书周中瑜贪污。文联领导方面知道了这件事情，不是追究贪污分子周中瑜的贪污罪行，反而庇护周中瑜，追查写信人的动机和成份。刘知侠任文联秘书长后，在使用干部上，有搞小集团的现象。他的思想作风，有许多地方令人非常不满。秘书处的工作，常常看人行事。一九五○年的干部家属救济粮，刘知侠一人就占了将近三分之一。刘知侠和私商的关系很不干净。他和济南的“皇宫”照相馆来往很密切，替“皇宫”照相馆在大观电影院的太平门上，设置电灯广告，为之大肆宣传，并帮“皇宫”拉生意。这样一来，他到“皇宫”照相，洗相片，就可以占些便宜。他把他的被管制的哥哥从家里带出来，介绍到省政府去工作。这件事引起群众很大不满。他的爱人生小孩住医院时，有三个公务员，一个小姑娘，轮流买送东西；家里还有一位岳母，一位事务长作后应。他的爱人出院后，再加上
    一个保姆伺候。他爱人怀孕五个月就休养，生产后开始工作，每天工作时间平均不超过两小时。
    文联领导方面不注意文艺干部的使用和组织文艺工作者的创作活动。这里有一些文艺工作者要求到农村，到朝鲜，参加群众斗争，接近群众生活，但实现这些要求是很困难的，即使有人能出去，也认为这是“特殊照顾”。另一方面，领导干部却从个人兴趣出发，让文联的主要力量去搞京戏，还派了专人到苏州去买行头。
    直接领导山东省文联的山东省委宣传部文艺处长冯毅之同志从来没有认真地对文联的工作作过检查。他和刘知侠的关系是不正常的，两人常在一起吃喝，他也接受过刘知侠的礼物，希望有关方面对这种情况进行检查。    一读者
