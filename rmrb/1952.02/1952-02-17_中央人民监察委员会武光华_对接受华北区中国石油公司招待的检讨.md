Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

To the Editor:

On December 25th of last year, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Zhang Zhenfang, pointing out the mistakes we made in investigating the explosion at the oil depot of the North China Company of the China Petroleum Company. I sincerely accept this criticism.

Chairman Mao has long called on us to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. However, we did not deeply recognize the importance of this instruction, and still held bourgeois concepts of "human sentiment" in our thinking. I thought that since the Petroleum Company was so attentive with their hospitality, it would seem inappropriate to refuse out of "human sentiment;" and I heard that this meal was prepared by the company's reception department itself, and would not cost much. Therefore, when comrades from the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate suggested that everyone not attend the banquet, I did not pay attention to it. After attending the banquet, we learned that the meal was not prepared by the reception department. The waste this time was even worse than what Zhang Zhenfang described.

Our behavior of accepting hospitality from the investigated party was a loss of the supervisory personnel's stance, which had a negative impact on the people's supervisory work among the masses. As the leader of the inspection team, I should bear the main responsibility for this mistake. It was also very wrong of me not to listen to the suggestions of the comrades from the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate. In addition to making a self-criticism, I am willing to work hard to correct my mistakes with everyone's help and supervision.

Wu Guanghua, Central People's Government Administrative Council, People's Supervisory Committee

Editor's Note: After this newspaper published reader Zhang Zhenfang's criticism of the North China Company of the China Petroleum Company, we have not yet received a self-criticism from the responsible cadres of the company. This attitude of ignoring criticism is wrong and should be quickly corrected and replied to immediately.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央人民监察委员会武光华
    对接受华北区中国石油公司招待的检讨
    编辑同志：去年十二月二十五日，人民日报刊载了读者张振芳的来信，指出我们在检查中国石油公司华北区公司油库爆炸案中所犯的错误，我诚恳地接受这个批评。
    毛主席早已号召我们要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。但是我们没有深刻地认识这一指示的重要性，在思想上还有资产阶级的“人情”观念。我认为石油公司既然殷勤招待，拒绝似乎不合“人情”；而且听说这次菜饭由公司招待处自办，花钱也不多，因此，当天津市人民检察署同志提议大家不要去参加宴席时，我就没有加以重视。赴宴后，我们才知道菜饭不是招待处办的。这次浪费的情况比张振芳所说的，有过之而无不及。
    我们接受被检查者的招待的行为，是有失监察人员的立场的，使人民监察工作在群众中遭受了不良影响。我是检查组的组长，应负这次错误的主要责任。我没有听天津市人民检察署同志的提议，也是十分错误的。我除了作检讨外，愿在大家的帮助和监督下，努力改正错误。
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会　武光华
    编者按：本报发表了读者张振芳对中国石油公司华北区公司的批评后，还没有收到该公司负责干部的检讨。这种忽视批评的态度是错误的，应迅速纠正并立即答复。
