    Learning from the Glorious Example of Martyr Luo Shengjiao

    Editor: The article "Immortal Internationalist Fighter" published in the People's Daily, describes the glorious deeds and noble qualities of the Volunteer Army's Martyr Luo Shengjiao. He is worthy of emulation by each and every one of us.

    In my work, I often start from personal interests, always thinking the grass is greener on the other side, and asking the leadership to transfer my job. After reading about the deeds of Martyr Luo Shengjiao, I feel ashamed. From now on, I must learn from Comrade Luo Shengjiao's spirit, overcome the erroneous idea of not being settled in my work, and serve the people wholeheartedly.
    Zhao Zhengyi, Staff Member of the General Affairs Department, North China People's Revolutionary University

    Editor: I read the newsletter recording Comrade Luo Shengjiao's glorious deeds in one breath. I couldn't help but stand up from my chair and remain silent for three minutes, expressing my deep condolences and respect to this immortal internationalist fighter. Like Comrade Luo Shengjiao, I am also a young man of twenty-one. However, there is still a lot of dross of individualism in me. I often worry about my own gains and losses. Now, I feel that this kind of individualism is extremely shameful and despicable. I am determined to learn from Comrade Luo Shengjiao's heroic example!

    Editor: On the morning of February 5th, our classmates listened to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station's broadcast of Martyr Luo Shengjiao's deeds in the classroom. Everyone silently lowered their heads, deeply moved by Martyr Luo's spirit of internationalism, and many students even shed tears.

    Martyr Luo's deeds reminded us of the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea. American planes recently cruelly slaughtered Korean children with toy bombs. From this comparison, we hate the American imperialist aggressors even more, and we love the Volunteer Army soldiers even more, and we must learn from their heroic example.

    学习罗盛教烈士的光辉榜样
    编辑同志：人民日报所载“不朽的国际主义战士”一文，记述了志愿军罗盛教烈士的光辉事迹和崇高的品质，他是值得我们每一个人学习的。
    我自己在工作中常常从个人兴趣出发，这山望见那山高，要求领导上调动我的工作。现在看了罗盛教烈士的事迹以后，使我感到惭愧。今后我一定要学习罗盛教同志的精神，克服不安心工作的错误思想，全心全意地为人民服务。
    华北人民革命大学总务科职员    赵正谊
    编辑同志：我一口气读完了记载罗盛教同志光辉事迹的通讯，我不禁感动的从椅子上站了起来静默了三分钟，对这位不朽的国际主义战士表示深深的哀悼和崇敬。和罗盛教同志一样，我也是一个二十一岁的青年了。但是，在我的身上还有不少个人主义思想的渣滓。我常常患得患失地考虑着自己。现在，我感到这种个人主义是万分可耻与卑鄙的。我决心要学习罗盛教同志的英雄榜样！
    河北高中学生    孟    拉
    编辑同志：二月五日早晨，我们同学在课室内收听北京人民广播电台播讲的罗盛教烈士的事迹。大家默不作声地低下了头，都深深地为罗烈士的国际主义精神所感动，许多同学还流下了眼泪。
    罗烈士的事迹使我们想起了美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行，美国飞机不久前曾经用玩具炸弹残忍地屠杀朝鲜的儿童。从这一对比中，使我们更加仇恨美帝国主义侵略者，而更加热爱志愿军战士，并要学习他们的英雄榜样。
    北京市第二中学学生  刘锡臣
