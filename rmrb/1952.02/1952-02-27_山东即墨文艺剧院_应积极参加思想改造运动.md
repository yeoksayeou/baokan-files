Shandong Jimo Literary and Art Troupe
Should Actively Participate in the Ideological Remolding Movement

To the Editor: On January 31st, we watched the "Tears of a Reforming Poor Woman" performed by Liu Kuitong's traveling troupe of the Jimo Literary and Art Troupe of Shandong Province and were very dissatisfied. This play portrays Zhao Yuniang, a smart and lively fisherman's daughter, as a silly and foolish daughter-in-law, Zhao Yuniang's mother as an old woman with all kinds of strange accents, and the simple and honest Zhao Ma as an ugly old woman who is both dull and foolish. At the time, we heard some audience members say, "It's really ruining the poor. Just because people are poor, does that mean they don't understand anything!" Afterward, we talked to Comrade Lin Tao, the person in charge of the literary and art troupe, about this opinion. We heard that some actors, instead of humbly examining themselves after hearing this opinion, actually said, "If I don't act like that, I won't be able to act at all!" "If Zhao Yuniang isn't so silly, how can it be like a play?" Such erroneous understanding is not isolated among the actors of the literary and art troupe. In the programs performed by the literary and art troupe, there often appear unreasonable, extremely low-level, and vulgar actions and words, sometimes making it impossible for the audience to watch. We hope that this phenomenon will attract the attention of the responsible comrades of the literary and art troupe, and that the drama workers of the literary and art troupe will actively participate in the ideological remolding movement, correct various incorrect understandings, and enable the performed programs to serve the people.

    山东即墨文艺剧院
    应积极参加思想改造运动
    编辑同志：一月三十一日，我们看了山东即墨文艺剧院刘奎童旅行剧团演出的“革新贫女泪”后，觉得很不满意。这个剧把聪明活泼的渔家女儿赵玉娘描写成为傻头傻脑的媳妇，把赵玉娘的母亲描写成为满嘴怪腔怪调的老太婆，还把淳朴老实的赵妈描写成为又呆又傻的丑婆子。当时我们听见有些观众说：“真糟蹋穷人，人家穷吧，就能穷得连什么都不懂！”以后，我们把这意见向文艺剧院负责人林涛同志谈了。听说有些演员听了这个意见，毫不虚心检讨，竟说：“要不那样演的话，我就不会演了！”“赵玉娘要不那样傻里傻气，怎么还像戏呢？”像这种错误认识在文艺剧院演员当中并不是个别的。文艺剧院演出的节目中，常常出现无理取闹、极端低级下流的动作和词句，有时竟使得观众看不下去了。我们希望这种现象能引起文艺剧院负责同志的注意，希望文艺剧院戏剧工作者积极参加思想改造运动，纠正各种不正确的认识，使演出的节目能够为人民服务。
