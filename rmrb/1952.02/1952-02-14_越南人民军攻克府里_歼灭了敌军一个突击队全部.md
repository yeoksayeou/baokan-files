    Xinhua News Agency, February 13th, North Vietnam dispatch from Vietnam News Agency on February 11th: On the evening of February 7th, the Vietnamese People's Army launched a fierce attack on the enemy forces entrenched in Phu Ly, the provincial capital of Ha Nam province, 50 kilometers south of Hanoi. The People's Army stormed into the city, completely annihilating the ruthless Luc-Kni commando team, which the people of Ha Nam province deeply hated, and occupied the puppet police outposts, capturing many heinous traitors. The People's Army raised the national flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam here, posted slogans in the enemy's intelligence office, and gave speeches to the large crowds who came to welcome the People's Army.

    In this attack, the People's Army annihilated the entire Luc-Kni commando team, killing the team's captain, Lieutenant Luc-Kni, and capturing 155 people. The People's Army seized eight light machine guns, seventy-two submachine guns, three mortars, forty rifles, ten pistols, nine radio transmitters, and a large quantity of ammunition.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, TASS, New York, February 8th: The United States, shocked by the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army, is stepping up military aid to French colonialists. Reports from "New York Post" reporter Alan confirm that weapons shipped to the French colonial army in Indochina are the highest priority in the current U.S. so-called "military aid" program. More U.S. weapons were shipped to Indochina in January than at any previous time. Alan wrote: Even more weapons will be shipped in February and March.
