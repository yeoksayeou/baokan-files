On Rainfall and Drought and Flood Problems in North China

Rainfall in North China from June to August 1951

Before June 1951, North China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the northern part of Shaanxi and southeastern part of Ningxia in the Northwest, which are connected to these areas, experienced severe drought due to being frequently controlled by dry continental air masses. There was a general lack of rain in this area in June, with monthly rainfall generally below 50 mm (1 mm equals 0.033 inches) except for northern Hebei and Pingyuan Province. Most areas of central Hebei, northern Shanxi, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, and northern Shaanxi and southeastern Ningxia received less than 10 mm. Compared with the average of previous years, it was 50 to 60 mm less. In June, not only was the total rainfall less than the average of previous years, but it was also concentrated at the beginning or end of the month, resulting in uneven distribution and more severe drought. Only Pingyuan Province had rain at the beginning of the month and two rains in the last ten days of the month, with a more even distribution.

In July last year, in the southern part of North China, rainfall greatly increased due to the northward advance of maritime air currents and frequent conflicts with continental air currents. The monthly rainfall in Pingyuan Province and the adjacent Shandong Province in East China averaged around 200 mm, with some areas exceeding 200 mm. This was 25 to 50 mm more than the average of previous years, and even 150 to 200 mm more in central Shandong, which was the main reason for the serious flooding. Pingyuan Province experienced two heavy rains from the 2nd to the 5th and from the 24th to the 25th. The rainfall in Anyang from the 2nd to the 5th totaled 134 mm, accounting for 60% of the total monthly rainfall; the rainfall in Xinxiang from the 24th to the 25th totaled 113 mm, accounting for 70% of the total monthly rainfall. In the northern part of North China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the eastern part of the Northwest connected to it, the rainfall in July was still not high, generally between 50 and 100 mm, except for some areas. The triangular area between Hebei, Shanxi, and Chahar, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, received less than 50 mm. The rainfall in northern Hebei Province and southeastern Chahar in July was more than 100 mm less than the average of previous years.

In August, the monthly rainfall in Pingyuan Province and the northern part of Shandong Province, which is connected to it, was between 150 and 200 mm, not far from the average of previous years. However, the distribution was very poor due to the concentration of time. Xinxiang received 132 mm in one day on the 27th, which was almost 75% of the total monthly rainfall. Due to the typhoon in the last ten days of the month, the monthly rainfall in eastern Shandong Province exceeded 350 mm, more than twice the average of previous years, but the scope was small and the impact was not significant. The monthly rainfall in northern Hebei and Shanxi was generally between 100 and 150 mm, slightly higher than the average of previous years. Most of this rainfall was concentrated in the days from the 11th to the 16th. In southern Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, northern Shaanxi, and eastern Ningxia, the monthly rainfall was about 40 to 60 mm. Except for Chahar, which was half less than the average of previous years, the others were close to the average of previous years. But in general, it still cannot meet the needs of crops.

Characteristics of Rainfall in North China

What are the natural causes of the frequent floods and droughts in North China? There are mainly two aspects: climate and terrain. In terms of climate, the main issue is rainfall. According to long-term meteorological records in Beijing and Tianjin, rainfall in North China has the following five characteristics:

1. Low total rainfall. North China is located in a semi-arid climate zone, and most areas have an average annual rainfall of about 400 to 500 mm. This is only about one-half of the Yangtze River basin and one-third of South China. Although the southern slope of the Yanshan Mountains, the southeastern slope of the Taihang Mountains, and the Taishan hilly area have relatively high rainfall, it is still only between 600 and 900 mm. The areas with the lowest rainfall, such as central Hebei, the Fen River basin in Shanxi, and the area in the north near the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have less than 400 mm.

2. Concentrated in summer. In North China, almost three-quarters or more of the annual rainfall is concentrated in the three summer months (June to August), and there is little rain or snow at other times. The rainfall in North China in summer is not less than the rainfall in East China and South Central China in the same season, but because it is particularly low in spring, autumn, and winter, the annual total is far less than the above two regions. Taking Tianjin as an example, the average annual rainfall in this area for the past 50 years is 538 mm, and the seasonal distribution is as follows:

		December-February	March-May	June-August	September-November
		2%		10%		75%		12%

The summer rainfall in Tianjin accounts for 75% of the annual rainfall. July has the most rainfall, accounting for 35% of the annual rainfall (191 mm); August is second, accounting for 28% of the annual rainfall (150 mm); while the total for the three winter months accounts for only 2% of the annual rainfall. This situation is extremely common in North China. Most of the annual rainfall is concentrated in the hot season, which is generally beneficial to agriculture. However, because it is concentrated in summer, it produces the following three shortcomings, all of which have a negative impact on agricultural production.

3. Frequent heavy rain. The annual rainfall in North China is not high, and most of it is concentrated in the summer. However, the summer rainfall is concentrated in a small number of days. The total monthly rainfall in July or August is often the result of only two or three heavy rains. Because this kind of heavy rain falls too fiercely and rapidly, not only is it difficult for the soil to absorb, and it provides little benefit to crops, but it often gathers in rivers, causing floods in the lower reaches and resulting in water disasters. In addition, it has a great impact on soil erosion, increasing the sand content of rivers and raising the river bed, which is also an indirect cause of river flooding. In Tianjin, the heavy rain with more than 50 mm in one day in July and August in the past eight years accounts for about one-half of the total, and the heavy rain with 100 mm in one day accounts for one-fifth to two-fifths.

4. Excessive variability. The large variation in rainfall from year to year in North China is also one of the main climate shortcomings. The average annual rainfall variability in most areas is more than 30%, and the average monthly variability in summer generally exceeds 60%, especially the rainfall at the turn of spring and summer is unreliable. The average variability in Tianjin in June reaches 90%. In the past 50 years in Tianjin, the minimum rainfall in each month of summer can be only a few millimeters to tens of millimeters, and the maximum can be three to four times the average rainfall.

				Annual		June		July		August
		Average		538		65		191		150
		Maximum		1222		219		861		433
		Minimum		254		4		35		18

5. Spring drought. Temperatures in North China are relatively high in spring and summer, so evaporation is very high. According to calculations, compared with rainfall (including snowfall) in Beijing, only from November to March does rainfall exceed evaporation, but because the amount of rain and snow in these months is not much, the water content in the soil is limited. After April, the temperature rises rapidly, and evaporation is far greater than rainfall. The soil moisture is greatly consumed. Even in normal years, the soil water deficit is at least 13 mm in April, at least 75 mm in May, and 73 mm in June. That is to say, more water must be irrigated to keep the soil from drying out completely. In July and August, rainfall is relatively abundant, and soil moisture is stored; although evaporation exceeds rainfall again in the autumn months, the soil has stored water, and the consumption is not large, so it is not completely arid. From the above, we can affirm two points: A. Spring drought in North China (April to June) is a frequent phenomenon. B. The cause of spring drought is due to the too little rain and snow in winter and spring, and the rapid rise in temperature and excessive evaporation consuming soil moisture in spring.

Assuming that the temperature (evaporation) and rainfall in Beijing over the past 71 years are used as a basis, and assuming that the maximum soil moisture content does not exceed 100 mm, it can be statistically shown that the probability of "drought" in North China is 94% in June, 36% in July, and 26% in August; the probability of "flood" is 6% in June and 36% in July and August. Although this is only a rough estimate, it can also be seen that the natural conditions in North China cause serious flooding and drought. This must be overcome vigorously by artificially developing water conservancy irrigation and afforestation.

How to Prevent Drought and Flood

From the analysis of the climate records of Beijing and Tianjin over the years, we know that spring drought and summer flood are not accidental but frequent phenomena in North China, and not local but quite widespread phenomena. Therefore, drought resistance and flood prevention work must be planned comprehensively and carried out on a large scale as early as possible. We suggest:

1. Construct large-scale water conservancy projects. Opening up water sources, reducing waste, and combining storage and discharge are the most basic ways to solve the problem of water and drought in North China. In this regard, the current People's Government has already started to act; however, it will be difficult to see results in the short term.

2. Plant forests extensively. Planting windbreaks in a planned way in the plains can not only prevent the destructive effects of wind (such as blowing away fine soil and seeds in the fields, and damaging crop seedlings, etc.) but also reduce the evaporation of ground moisture and the volatilization of crop moisture, which can play a considerable role in drought prevention. In addition, planting forests extensively in the upper reaches of rivers and mountainous areas to maintain moisture in the soil and prevent erosion of ground soil has good effects on flood prevention and irrigation.

3. Widely mobilize the masses to carry out small-scale farmland water conservancy construction. According to the specific conditions of various places, carry out various small-scale farmland water conservancy construction, such as digging canals and wells, promoting waterwheels, storing water and ice, improving the management of water conservancy institutions, and using water rationally. This is the most effective way to prevent and fight drought at present, and it is also a major event that can and should be done at present.

4. Select drought-resistant crops. High lands are not easy to irrigate. Selecting drought-resistant crops is the best way to overcome drought and wasteland in mountainous areas.

5. Establish meteorological stations extensively and strengthen forecasting work. The service of agricultural meteorology in the Soviet Union focuses on long-term climate forecasting. The level of temperature and the amount of rainfall can generally be predicted one or two months in advance. This kind of forecast can of course play a considerable coordinating role in preventing drought and flood. In addition, if the meteorological stations are set up appropriately and the communication is rapid, it is possible to have considerable certainty in general flood forecasts and warnings of strong winds, heavy rains, hail, and frost.

    关于华北的雨量和华北的旱涝问题
    卢鋈
    一九五一年六月至八月华北各地的雨量
    一九五一年六月以前，华北地区、内蒙自治区，以及和这些地区相连的西北区的陕西北部和宁夏东南部，因为经常在干燥的大陆气团的控制下，旱情相当严重。这一地区六月份普遍缺雨，全月雨量除河北北部和平原省外，一般都在五十公厘以下（一公厘合零点零三三寸），而且河北中部、山西北部、察哈尔和绥远二省以及陕西北部和宁夏东南部大部分都在十公厘以下。和历年平均数比较，少了五十到六十公厘不等。六月份不仅总雨量比历年平均数要少，同时还集中在月初或月终，分配不匀，以致旱灾更为严重。只有平原省在月初下了一场雨，下旬下了两场雨，分配得比较均匀一些。
    去年七月份华北地区南部，由于海洋气流向北推进，和大陆气流经常发生冲突，雨量大为增加。平原省和相连的华东区山东省全月雨量平均都在二百公厘左右，部分地区还超过了二百公厘。比历年平均多了二十五到五十公厘，山东中部甚至多了一百五十到二百公厘，这是酿成严重水灾的主要原因。平原省二日到五日和二十四日到二十五日下了两场大雨；安阳二日到五日的雨量共计一百三十四公厘，占全月总量百分之六十；新乡二十四日到二十五日的雨量共计一百一十三公厘，占全月总量百分之七十。华北地区北部、内蒙自治区以及和它相连的西北地区的东部，除部分地区而外，七月雨量依然不多，大致在五十到一百公厘之间。河北、山西和察哈尔之间的三角地带以及内蒙自治区，而且还在五十公厘以下。河北省北部和察哈尔东南部七月份的雨量比历年平均少了一百公厘以上。
    八月份平原省以及和它相连的山东省的北部，全月雨量都在一百五十到二百公厘之间，和历年平均相差不远。不过由于时间太集中，分配情形很不好。新乡二十七日一天里就下了一百三十二公厘，差不多等于全月雨量的百分之七十五。山东东部由于下旬受了台风的影响，全月雨量超过了三百五十公厘，比历年平均多了两倍，但是范围很小，影响不大。河北和山西北部全月雨量大致在一百到一百五十公厘之间，比历年平均稍多。这些雨量大部分都集中在十一日到十六日这几天里。山西南部、察哈尔、绥远以及陕西北部和宁夏东部一带，全月雨量约四十到六十公厘，除察哈尔比历年平均少了一半外，其他都和历年平均数接近。但是总的说来，还是不能满足农作物的需要。
    　华北雨量的特点
    华北经常发生水灾旱灾的天然原因是什么呢？主要有气候和地形两方面。气候方面，主要的就是雨量问题。根据北京和天津长期的气象纪录看来，华北雨量有以下五个特点：
    1、总雨量少。华北气候带半干燥性，大部分地区全年雨量平均都在四百到五百公厘左右。大约只有长江流域的二分之一，华南的三分之一。燕山南坡、太行山东南坡和泰山邱陵地雨量虽比较多，但是也不过在六百到九百公厘之间，雨量最少的地区像河北中部、山西汾河流域以及北部靠近内蒙自治区一带，都还不到四百公厘。
    2、集中于夏季。华北各地全年雨量，差不多有四分之三以上都集中在夏季三个月（六月到八月），其他时间雨雪稀少。华北夏季的雨量并不比同季华东和中南区的雨量少，只是由于春、秋、冬三季特别少，全年总量也就远比不上以上两个区域了。以天津为例，这个地区五十年来全年雨量平均为五百三十八公厘，四季分配情形如左：十二月—二月
　三月—五月　六月—八月　九月—十一月百分之二　百分之十一百分之七十五　百分之十二
    天津夏季雨量占全年百分之七十五。七月雨量最多，占全年百分之三十五（一百九十一公厘）；八月次之，占全年百分之二十八（一百五十公厘）；而冬季三个月总共才占全年的百分之二。这种情形，在华北各地极其普遍。全年雨量绝大部分集中在热的季节，对农业来说，一般地是有利的。不过因为夏季集中，却产生以下的三个缺点，都对农业生产有不好的影响。
    3、暴雨多。华北全年雨量不多，大部分集中在夏季，而夏季的雨量，却又是集中在很少数的日子里。七月或八月的全月雨量，往往只是两三次暴雨的结果。这种暴雨，因为下降得太猛太急，不但土壤不容易吸收，对农作物很少利益，而且常常汇集到河流里，引起下流的洪水泛滥而造成水灾。此外，对土壤的冲刷作用大，使河流含沙量增加，垫高河床，也是间接造成河流泛滥的一个原因。天津近八年来七、八两月的雨量，一日间下降五十公厘以上的暴雨大约占二分之一，一日间下降一百公厘的暴雨也要占五分之一到五分之二。
    4、变动过大。华北历年雨量变动大，也是气候上的主要缺点之一。各地历年雨量平均变动率多在百分之三十以上，而且夏季各月平均变动率一般地都超过百分之六十，春夏之交的雨量尤其不可靠。天津六月份的平均变动率达百分之九十。天津五十年来夏季各月份的雨量最少可以只有几公厘到几十公厘，最多可以多到平均雨量的三倍到四倍。
    　　　　　全年　　　六月　　七月　　八月
    　平均　　五三八　　六五　一九一　　一五○
    　最大　一二二二　二一九　八六一　　四三三
    　最小　　二五四　　　四　　三五　　　一八
    5、春旱。华北春夏的温度相当高，因此蒸发很盛。根据计算的结果，北京的平均蒸发量和雨量（包括雪量）比较起来，只有十一月到三月是雨量超过蒸发量，但是因为这几个月的雨雪量并不多，土壤里含水有限。到了四月以后，温度上升很快，蒸发量远大于雨量，土壤水分大量消耗，就是在正常年份，土壤缺水量四月至少为十三公厘，五月至少为七十五公厘，六月为七十三公厘。也就是说，必须灌溉更多的水，才能保持土壤不至于完全干燥。七、八两月份，雨量比较丰富，土壤水分有存储；秋季的几个月虽然蒸发量又超过了雨量，不过土壤里有存储的水分，而且消耗量不大，还不至于完全旱化。从以上所说，我们可以肯定两点：甲、华北的春旱（四月到六月）是个经常的现象。乙、春旱的原因是由于冬季和春季的雨雪量太少，而且春季温度上升太快、蒸发消耗土壤水分过多所致。
    假定以北京七十一年来的温度（蒸发量）和雨量做根据，并且假定土壤含水量最大不超过一百公厘，可以统计出华北地区“旱”的可能性六月为百分之九十四，七月为百分之三十六，八月为百分之二十六；“涝”的可能性六月为百分之六，七、八月都为百分之三十六。这虽然只是一种大致的估计，但是也可以看出在华北地区天然条件造成的涝旱现象的严重性。这必须用人工发展水利灌溉和造林等办法来大力予以克服。
    　　怎样预防旱涝
    从北京和天津历年来气候纪录分析的结果，我们知道春旱夏涝，在华北并不是偶然的而是经常的现象，不是局部的而是相当普遍的现象。因此抗旱和防涝的工作必须有全面的计划，大规模地及早进行。我们建议：
    一、建设大规模的水利工程。开源节流、蓄泄兼施是解决华北水旱问题的最基本的办法。在这一方面，目前人民政府已经在动手作；不过短期内还难以见效。
    二、广植森林。在平原地带有计划地种植防风林，既可以防止风的破坏作用（如吹走田地上的细土和种子，吹坏作物幼苗等）又可以减少地面水分的蒸发和作物水分的挥发，对于防旱是能起相当大的作用的。此外，在河流的上游及山地普遍植林，以保持土壤中的水分，防止冲刷地面土壤，对防洪和灌溉都有良好的作用。
    三、广泛发动群众进行小型农田水利建设。根据各地具体情况，进行各种小型农田水利建设，如开渠凿井、推广水车、储水养冰、改善对水利机构的管理、合理用水等，这是目前防旱抗旱的最有效的办法，也是目前可能作而且应该作的一件大事。
    四、选种抗旱作物。高地不易灌溉，选种抗旱作物是克服山地旱荒的最好办法。
    五、广设气象台站，加强预告工作。苏联农业气象的服务方面多着重气候的长期预告。温度的高低和雨量的多寡，一般的都能在一、两个月以前预测。这种预告对于防旱防涝当然可以起相当的配合作用。此外，气象台站如果设置得合适，通讯联络迅速，对于一般的洪水预告和大风、大雨、降雹、霜冻等警告是可以有相当把握的。
