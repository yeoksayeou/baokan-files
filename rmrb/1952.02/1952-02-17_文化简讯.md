Cultural Briefs

    ▲ In order to create conditions for the comprehensive development of the ideological remolding movement in Northern Jiangsu, the Department of Culture and Education of the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office took advantage of the winter vacation to transfer 140 principals, teaching directors, and teachers from fifty middle schools to form the Northern Jiangsu Middle School Teachers Political Research Association. They studied Mao Zedong Thought and, in coordination with the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, studied Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's report at the 34th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director Bo Yibo's report "Striving for a Deep and Universal Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement." The main requirements of this study were to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, to distinguish between the ideological boundaries of the proletariat and the non-proletariat, to establish a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people, and to learn Chairman Mao's style of linking theory with practice, connecting with the masses, and criticism and self-criticism, so as to enhance understanding, transform thinking, and lay the foundation for the widespread development of the ideological remolding movement in various middle schools in Northern Jiangsu in the future.
    ▲ The third issue of "Current Affairs Handbook" has been published. This issue contains a propaganda outline entitled "Opposing the Frenzied Attack of the Bourgeoisie," which explains from several aspects that the essence of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy is to oppose the bourgeoisie's attack. There is a piece of information called "Shameless Tricks of Unscrupulous Merchants to Sabotage the Confession and Exposure Movement," accompanied by illustrations. This issue's "Current Affairs Commentary on Propaganda Work" contains two articles: (1) Reporters and propagandists should actively carry out propaganda activities against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; (2) Wage a struggle against the illegal activities of the industrial and commercial circles. In addition, this issue contains nine propaganda posters and comic strips.
    This issue contains two "Current Affairs Q&As," which are: (1) American Imperialism is Meeting Resistance Everywhere; (2) Talking about the Price Issue.
