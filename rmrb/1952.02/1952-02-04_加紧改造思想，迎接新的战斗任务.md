Intensify Ideological Remolding to Meet New Combat Missions
Lu Kanru, Vice President of Shandong University

On New Year's Day this year, Chairman Mao congratulated us on "the victory on the ideological remolding front." The Beijing People's Daily editorial also pointed out that we should complete "the main preparations for large-scale economic construction" in 1952, one of which is "preparing cadres," so "an ideological remolding movement should be launched among intellectuals so that existing and future intellectuals can loyally serve the people's cause." As we recall the great achievements in all aspects over the past two years since the founding of the country and look forward to the bright future, we cannot help but deeply feel the urgent need for ideological remolding of old intellectuals. Otherwise, we will not only let down Chairman Mao, the motherland, and the people, but also ourselves.

Since liberation, although I have often verbally said that I need to learn, in fact, I have not paid enough attention to learning, one of the main reasons being the "burden of progress." I often think: I read Marxist-Leninist books twenty years ago, and I was repeatedly included in the "blacklist" before liberation. After liberation, I became a representative here and a member there, so I am probably "almost" there ideologically; others need to be reformed, but I can relax a little and at most improve a little bit more slowly.

Here, the examples of two friends gave me a mirror. One friend participated in the revolution twenty years ago. Although he lost contact later, he has been working hard for the democratic movement. Before liberation, he suffered a lot of persecution from secret agents, so he has always been someone I admired. However, after liberation, he participated in more important work and became "arrogant" and stopped making progress, creating a very bad impression among the masses. Another friend read a lot of theoretical books and wrote many good articles before liberation. After liberation, due to the same "complacency," his teaching remained at the original level, and he refused to accept students' opinions, even scolding students for being low-level. Perhaps the way others helped him was a bit blunt, but if he sincerely sought progress, he would not mind the bluntness of the method, but realize his shortcomings, and thus be able to improve a step further. These two examples aroused my vigilance and made me realize that I also have the same burden. Sometimes I overcorrected and confused "humility" with "worldliness" in the old society, and I was unwilling to express my opinions on everything, especially when the opinions of the two old cadres and old party members were inconsistent. This is obviously because I have not yet established the attitude of being the master, and I value personal gains and losses more than collective interests.

In recent studies, I specifically examined my position. The most common problem of old intellectuals is an unstable position, a failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and everything starts from personal interests. I thought I had already understood it, but it could not stand the test. For example, last year a fellow villager wrote to me saying that my cousin, who was an engineer in a yarn factory, was suppressed as a counter-revolutionary and was "wronged." On the one hand, I wrote back to tell him: According to several cases I have witnessed, if it is indeed a wrongful arrest, it will eventually be released; if he is sentenced, there will be evidence. But on the one hand, I couldn't help but care about my cousin's whereabouts, and I kept an eye on the list of counter-revolutionary criminals announced in the newspaper there every day. Recently, I heard that he was sentenced to seven years and sent to the Huai River area for labor reform, and I felt a little sad. Therefore, I think that if someone in my family or relatives has anti-people crimes and hides in my residence, it is quite doubtful whether I can resolutely report it. This is about after liberation. As for before liberation, there were countless speeches and actions that lost their position (such as sitting idly by while the reactionary authorities at Northeastern University expelled progressive students without the courage to object). How can I claim to be "advanced"?

Due to the lack of serious study, old and new ideas still coexist peacefully in my mind. I found that the influence of Hu Shi still exists in my thinking, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have only become superficial decorations. More than thirty years ago, when I was studying at Peking University, I joined the New Culture Movement launched by the May Fourth Movement, but mistakenly believed that Hu Shi was the leader of this movement and worshiped him wholeheartedly. He gave me the deepest influence in two points: the first is to deny the existence of classes, deny the necessity of revolution, and advocate a little bit of reform; the second is to emphasize academics for academics, encourage the separation of theory from practice, and believe that the contribution of discovering the ancient meaning of a word is equal to the contribution of discovering a star. Therefore, I felt that his "historical habit" and "textual research habit" suited my appetite, and I put all my energy into "sorting out the national heritage." Later, when I went to Shanghai to teach, under the influence of the "Proletarian Literature" movement, especially under the influence of the "Left League," I read Lu Xun's and others' translations of scientific art theory. The idol of Hu Shi in my mind began to shake; at the same time, his ugly behavior of colluding with reactionary warlords also aroused my disgust, making me gradually alienate him. However, alienating this person did not criticize his thoughts; on the contrary, Marxist-Leninist literary theory and reactionary reformist thoughts were mixed up and entangled in my mind, making me write some nondescript books such as "A History of Chinese Poetry," which deceived some readers in the publishing industry and some students in the university. Looking back, how can I not regret it!

Last month, I read Comrade Li Jie's "On the Cultural Study Front - I Have a Passionate Heart" (see the "Guangming Daily" on December 12, 1951), which aroused my great excitement. She came from a poor peasant family and is now a student at the Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Fast-Track Middle School. She couldn't write an essay a year ago, but now she has extraordinary achievements. This is not surprising, but what surprised me was the heroic spirit expressed in her article. She said: "I not only saw the past, saw today, but also saw my future. My future is so bright and splendid, so happy and beautiful. However, I also thought about the obstacles and difficulties in the process of advancement. But I am not afraid of it, because I have a resolute heart, and even more because I am a communist party member, I grew up in the era of Mao Zedong. Today I can enjoy enough sunshine and food - Mao Zedong Thought, Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, all difficulties can disappear in front of me." She also said: "But I clearly know what Gorky said: what is placed in front of writers is not roses, but big iron nails, and we must walk over them barefoot, passing is victory, is light. I will walk over it, I have the confidence to complete my great ideal. Because I also have a passionate heart, a determination to complete the glorious study task, it gives me unlimited courage, infinite power..." Reading it really made me feel ashamed. Why can't I have the same strong self-confidence? Why don't I dare to say "I am sure I can run the school well"? Why don't I dare to say "I am sure I can teach the course well"? Why?

The reason is very simple: I was born in a feudal landlord family, received feudalist and capitalist reactionary education, and have never been tempered by revolutionary practice, nor have I studied well, nor have I received "enough sunshine and food - Mao Zedong Thought, Marxism-Leninism," so my mind is still full of non-proletarian corrupt ideas, so I cannot have her "resolute heart," "passionate heart," and I don't have her "unlimited courage, infinite power" to overcome all selfish and self-interested thoughts to better serve the people's education cause.

People whose old ideas have not been moved will never stand up and wholeheartedly bear all the responsibilities of the people's teacher. They are afraid of trouble, afraid of offending people, unwilling to spend more effort, and use their brains to discover problems and solve problems. That's me. Since liberation, I have participated in the leadership work of Shandong University for more than two years, but not to mention that most of the faculty, staff, students, and workers do not know me, there are even heads of departments and sections who have not said a word to me until now. Every day, I only read official documents in the office building, and never went deep into the masses to understand the situation. How can we promote work by using this bureaucratic "leadership" method left over from the old society to lead a new democratic university?

Now we must strengthen the resistance against the US and aid Korea, and we must also carry out various constructions. There is a great need for colleges and universities to train talents in the next five or six years. If it is still the original set, it will definitely not meet the needs of the country. To meet new tasks, we must vigorously improve teaching work; and to improve work, we must first thoroughly transform the thinking of teachers. Those of us who have worked in old universities for a long time have a mind full of reformist educational ideas, especially old-fashioned formal ideas that are divorced from reality, which is the biggest obstacle in the process of transforming old universities into new universities. Due to the widespread development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the poison of old educational ideas has been more clearly exposed.

It is entirely necessary to vigorously carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in schools. Because the movement itself is also a ideological remolding movement, and it is the most practical and effective ideological remolding movement. Therefore, we say that this movement is inseparable from ideological remolding and the implementation of the new school system; it is not an interlude added out of thin air halfway, but one of the main links in reforming higher education. At first, I thought that schools were a frugal place, so what "officials" could be "bureaucratic," what "corruption" could be "greedy," and what "waste" could be "prodigal"? The facts have proved that the old university does not start from the needs of national construction at all, and it itself is a specimen of extravagance, waste, and bureaucracy that is divorced from reality. In our school, according to the spirit of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, several responsible persons took the lead in self-criticism, followed by a democratic inspection meeting, and all employees of the school enthusiastically spoke, from 8:00 am to 11:00 pm, the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. We old intellectuals have never participated in the fiery movement of the masses, and we have received an unprecedented and extremely profound education at this combat-rich conference.

According to the preliminary estimates of colleagues, the first gain of this conference was to criticize the old educational ideas: such as only seeking qualifications when hiring people, overemphasizing returned students, and ignoring moral and talent conditions; another example is that the direction and tasks of various departments and departments are not clear, causing confusion in the thinking of teachers and students; another example is that they do not pay attention to specialized courses, and the establishment of departments does not meet the actual needs, and the affiliated internship units still have a profit-seeking perspective, and even a profiteering thought, and so on. The second is to expose shocking waste phenomena: such as professors' travel expenses exceeded more than 40 million yuan, and painting the house cost 120 million yuan, some of which were unnecessary; another example is that the organization is huge, with more people than necessary, more than 2,000 students but more than 1,000 employees, some teachers only teach one course, some staff and workers only work for two or three hours a day, and so on. As for corruption incidents, there are not too few either. All units in the school have them. As far as the affiliated hospital is concerned, there are also huge cases of tens of millions of yuan. These phenomena of corruption and waste are based on the bureaucratic nature of several of our responsible persons—especially me—as a hotbed. The most serious manifestation of our bureaucracy is that we do not go deep into understanding the situation and cannot grasp the policies, so that the work plan remains on paper, and we rarely go to earnestly implement it. Doing things follows the bad habits of "pushing" and "dragging" in the old society, and this bad habit has its roots in old ideas.

This conference enriched the content of our ideological remolding movement and promoted our work of improving teaching. We have more clearly drawn a line between new and old ideas, and more firmly established the idea of ​​serving the people and serving the motherland, paving the way for the implementation of the new school system and the preparation of training construction cadres. In this movement, I deeply realized that it is extremely dangerous for us old intellectuals to often "step on two boats" ideologically. One foot is on the boat of the exploiting class, and the other foot is on the boat of the working class, and these two boats will sail in opposite directions. At that time, we will inevitably fall into the bottom of the water with a plop. If our butts are sitting on the boat of the exploiting class and only put our feet on the boat of the working class, it is even more dangerous. Because when the two boats diverge, we will inevitably follow the exploiting class to destruction and move away from the working class. Therefore, we must resolutely sever the thousands of ties with the old society in thought, and resolutely "lean to one side," leaning towards the working class with a long future. Because only this road is the only way out for us intellectuals. Of course, ideological remolding is painful; but after a period of pain, if we can transform ourselves and become a new person, it is truly supreme happiness. Some people say that transformation is a long-term process and there is no need to be impatient; but we cannot use the excuse of being long-term to slack off or intend to rest for a while. Just like eating, eating is also a long-term process, but we cannot say that we will take a day off today and not eat. If we take learning lighter than eating, we will never learn well in our lives. I would like to make up my mind with my friends, and vow to transform myself well in this study, to bravely meet new combat missions.

    加紧改造思想，迎接新的战斗任务  
    山东大学副校长  陆侃如
    今年元旦，毛主席祝贺我们在“思想改造战线上的胜利”。北京人民日报社论也指出要在一九五二年完成“大规模经济建设的主要准备工作”，其中工作之一便是“准备干部”，所以“应当在知识分子中间展开思想改造运动，以便使现有的和将来的知识分子能够忠诚地服务于人民事业”。我们回想建国两年来各方面的伟大成就，展望未来辉煌的远景，不能不深深地感觉到旧知识分子思想改造工作的迫切需要，否则我们不但对不起毛主席，对不起祖国，对不起人民，也对不起自己了。
    解放后，我虽然口头上也常说需要学习，但事实上对于学习的重视是非常不够的，其中主要的原因之一便是“进步的包袱”。我常常想：我在二十年前就读过马克思列宁主义的书籍，解放前曾一再被列入“黑名单”内，解放后又在这里当代表，那里当委员，在思想上大概已经“差不多”了；别人需要改造，我可以放松一些，至多再慢慢地提高一点就是了。
    在这里，两位朋友的榜样给了我一面镜子。一位朋友在二十年前曾参加革命，后虽断了联系，但一直为民主运动努力，解放前备受特务的迫害，所以他一向是我所钦佩的人。但解放后他参加了比较重要的工作，就“自高自大”起来，不再继续进步，在群众中造成极坏的印象。还有一位朋友在解放前读过不少理论书籍，也写过不少的好文章。在解放后由于同样“自满”的情绪，教书停留在原有的水平上，学生提意见也不肯接受，反骂学生程度低。也许别人帮助他的方式稍嫌生硬一点，但他如果真心求进步的话，一定会不介意方式的生硬，而认识到自己的缺点，因而便能提高一步。这两个例子引起我的警惕，使我意识到自己也有同样的包袱。有时我又矫枉过正，把“虚心”和旧社会里的“世故”混同起来，遇事都不肯发表自己的主张，特别是在两个老干部、老党员意见不一致的时候。这显然是由于我还没有确立主人翁的态度，把个人的得失看得比集体的利害更重要。
    在最近的学习中，我特别检查了一下我的立场。旧知识分子最普遍的毛病是立场不稳，敌我不分，一切只从个人利益出发。我自己认为早已搞明白了，其实是经不起考验的。例如去年有位同乡写信来，说我的一位在纱厂里当工程师的堂兄以反革命被镇压的“冤枉”。我一面回信告诉他：根据我所目睹的几个案件来看，如确系误捕，终必被释放；如判了罪，那不会没有证据的。可是我一面也忍不住关心堂兄的下落，天天留心那边报纸上公布反革命罪犯的名单。最近听说他判罪七年，送淮河地区劳动改造，又有点恻然。因此，我想，如果我本家或亲戚中有人有反人民的罪行而躲到我寓内的话，我是否能决心毅然检举是颇成疑问的。——这是就解放以后说，至于解放以前，则丧失立场的言论和行动（如在东北大学时坐视反动当局开除进步学生而没有勇气去反对）更多得不胜枚举了。怎能自命“前进”呢？
    由于学习的不认真，在我脑子里至今还是新旧思想和平共居。我发现我的思想中仍存在着浓厚的胡适的影响，而马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想只成了外表的点缀。三十几年前，我在北京大学读书时，投入了五四运动所掀起的新文化运动，却误认为胡适是这运动的领导人，五体投地地崇拜他。他给我影响最深的有两点：第一是否认阶级的存在，否认革命的必要，而主张一点一滴的改良；第二是强调为学术而学术，鼓励理论与实际脱节，认为发现一个字的古义与发现一颗恒星的贡献是相等的。因此，我觉得他的“历史癖”与“考据癖”很合我的脾胃，而把全部精力化在“整理国故”上。后来到上海教书，在“普罗文学”运动的影响下，特别在“左联”的影响下，读到了鲁迅先生的和别人的关于科学的艺术论的几部译著，我心目中的胡适的偶像开始动摇；同时他和反动军阀勾结的丑态也引起我的厌恶，使我逐渐地和他疏远。可是疏远了这个人，却并没有批判了他的思想；而且相反地，马克思列宁主义的文艺理论和反动的改良主义思想在我脑子中混淆起来，纠缠起来，使我写了些四不像的书如“中国诗史”等，在出版界欺骗了一些读者，在大学里又欺骗了一些学生。回想起来，惭悔何及！
    上月我读到李捷同志的“在文化学习战线上——我有着一颗火热的心”（见一九五一年十二月十二日“光明日报”），引起我极大的兴奋。她出身贫农，现在是北京实验工农速成中学学生，一年前还不会作文，现在却已有过人的成就。这还不足奇，使我惊讶的是她文章中所表现的英雄气概。她说：“我不仅看见了过去，看见了今天，而且我也看见了我的未来。我的未来是那样光明灿烂，是那样幸福与美满。可是，我也想到了前进中的障碍和困难。然而我不怕它，因为我有刚毅的心，更因为我是一个共产党员，我是生长在毛泽东时代。今天我能享受足够的阳光和食粮——毛泽东思想、马克思列宁主义。所以，一切困难都能在我面前消失。”又说：“但我清楚的知道高尔基所说的：摆在作家面前的不是玫瑰，而是大铁钉子，而我们必须赤着脚从上面走过去，过去就是胜利，就是光明。我就要从上面走过去，我有信心完成我伟大的理想。因为我还有着一颗火热的心，一颗完成光荣学习任务的决心，它给我无限量的勇气，无穷的力量……”我读了真使我自惭形秽。为什么我不能有同样坚强的自信心？为什么我不敢说“我有把握把学校办好”？为什么我不敢说“我有把握把功课教好”？为什么？
    理由很简单：我出身于封建地主家庭，受着封建主义的和资本主义的反动教育，始终没有经过革命实践的锻炼，也没有好好学习，没有接受到“足够的阳光和食粮——毛泽东思想、马克思列宁主义”，至今满脑子还装着非无产阶级的腐旧思想，因此我便不能有她那颗“刚毅的心”，“火热的心”，也就没有她那种“无限的勇气，无穷的力量”，去克服一切自私自利的念头，来更好地为人民教育事业服务。
    旧思想原封没动的人决不会挺起胸膛，全心全意负担起人民教师的一切责任。遇事怕麻烦，又怕得罪人，不肯多费心力，开动脑筋，去发现问题，解决问题。我就是这样。解放后，我参加山东大学的领导工作，已两年多了，可是不要说教职员学生工友大都不认识，连系科主任还有至今没谈过一句话的。每天只在办公楼上批阅公文，从没有深入群众，了解情况。用这种旧社会遗留下来的官僚主义的“领导”方式去领导一个新民主主义的大学，怎么能推进工作呢？
    现在我们一面要加强抗美援朝，一面又要进行各项建设，五六年内需要高等学校培养的人才是很多很多的。如果还是原来的一套，决不能适应国家的需要。要迎接新的任务，必须大力改进教学工作；而要改进工作，首先必须彻底改造教师的思想。我们曾经长期在旧大学里工作过的人，一脑子改良主义派的教育思想，特别是脱离实际的旧型正规的思想，这是在旧大学转变为新大学的过程中最大的阻力。由于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的普遍开展，旧教育思想的毒害更鲜明地暴露出来了。
    在学校里大力进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，是完全必要的。因为这个运动的本身也是一个思想改造运动，而且是最实际最有效的思想改造运动。所以我们说，这个运动是和改造思想，实行新学制分不开的；它不是半路上凭空加入的插曲，而是改革高等教育的主要环节之一。起初我还以为学校是清苦的地方，还有何“官”可“僚”，何“污”可“贪”，何“费”可“浪”呢？事实却证明：旧大学根本不从国家建设需要出发，它本身就是脱离实际的铺张浪费和官僚主义的标本。我们学校里根据反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的精神，几位负责人带头检讨，接着就召开了民主检查大会，全校员工踊跃发言，自上午八时直至夜十一时，空气至为热烈。我们旧知识分子从未参加过群众的火热的运动，在这个富有战斗性的大会上受到了空前的极深刻的教育。
    这个大会的收获，根据同人们的初步估计，首先是批判了旧教育思想：如聘用人员只讲求资历，过分重视留学生，而忽略了德才条件；又如各院系方针任务不明确，在师生思想上造成了混乱；又如不重视专修科，设系也不按实际需要，而附设实习单位还存在着营利观点，甚至暴利思想，等等。其次是揭发了惊人的浪费现象：如教授旅费超支了四千多万元，粉刷房子一亿二千多万元，其中一部分开支是不必要的；又如机构庞大，人浮于事，两千多学生却有一千多员工，有些教员只开一门课，有些职员工友一天只工作二三小时，等等。至于贪污的事件，也并不太少，全校一般单位都有，就附设医院而言，还有几千万元的巨案。这些贪污浪费的现象是靠了我们几个负责人的——特别是我的——官僚主义作温床的。我们官僚主义表现最严重的是不深入了解情况，不能掌握政策，使工作计划停留在字面上，很少去认真贯彻。办事沿袭了旧社会“推”和“拖”的坏作风，而这种坏作风是有其旧思想的根源的。
    这个大会丰富了我们思想改造运动的内容，推动了我们改进教学的工作。我们更明确地划清了新旧思想的界线，更坚定了为人民服务、为祖国服务的思想，替新学制的实行和培养建设干部的准备工作铺平了道路。在这运动里，我深深体会到：我们旧知识分子在思想上常常“脚蹬两只船”，那是极危险的。一只脚在剥削阶级的船上，一只脚在工人阶级的船上，而这两只船将向相反的方向开行，到那时我们免不了扑通一声掉下水底。如果我们屁股坐在剥削阶级的船上，只把两只脚搁在工人阶级的船上，那更危险。因为当两只船分途时，我们必然的跟着剥削阶级走向灭亡，而远离了工人阶级了。所以，我们必须坚决地割断和旧社会在思想上千丝万缕的联系，坚决地“一边倒”，倒向前程远大的工人阶级。因为只有这样的一条道路，才是我们知识分子唯一的出路。当然，思想改造是痛苦的；但在一阵痛苦之后，如能脱胎换骨，做个新人，那真是无上的幸福。有人说，改造是长期的，不必急躁；但我们不能藉口长期而懈怠下来，或存心憩一憩。正如吃饭一样，吃饭也是长期的，但我们不能说今天休息一天不吃饭。我们若把学习看得比吃饭还轻，那是一辈子也学不好的。愿与朋友们同下决心，立誓在这次学习中把自己改造好，来勇敢地迎接新的战斗任务。
