    Some Units in Northern Jiangsu Should Inspect the Wasteful Phenomenon of Overstaffing
    To the Editor: Half a year ago, I noticed the wasteful phenomenon of overstaffing in many units in northern Jiangsu.
    According to the central government's regulations on the establishment of organizations at all levels, the number of personnel in district offices should not exceed 26. However, since the end of last year, each district office in Suqian County has increased to more than 40 people. The phenomenon of adding personnel indiscriminately in various departments of the county people's government is even more serious. The Civil Affairs Section has a staffing level of only six people, but half a year ago it had already increased to more than a dozen. The Agricultural Tax Section and the Agriculture and Forestry Section have also exceeded their staffing levels, with more than 20 people in each section. The same is true for the enterprise departments in the Northern Jiangsu District. One Native Produce Office has more than 100 people working there, and the staff of one Grain Company is also over 100, both two or three times more than the original staffing level. The most typical case is the Huaiyin City Fur Company, which has more than 50 people working, but only receives seven or eight cowhides per day. Adding one person is no small matter; each "supply system" cadre requires an annual expenditure of more than 2,000 jin of public grain. And more than 2,000 jin of public grain must be supplied by at least ten peasant households.
    I believe that it is wrong for some units in northern Jiangsu to fail to comply with the central government's regulations on the establishment of organizations in this way. I hope that the relevant leaders will inspect and deal with this, and I also hope that the institutions at all levels in other regions will pay attention to this issue.

    苏北某些单位应检查人浮于事的浪费现象
    编辑同志：半年以前，我看到苏北不少单位有人浮于事的浪费现象。
    依照中央对各级机构编制的规定，区公所人员不得超过二十六人。但宿迁县各区公所从去年年底起都增加到四十多人。县人民政府各部门乱添人的现象更严重。民政科按编制只有六个人，半年以前却已经增加到十几个人。农税科、农林科也都超过编制，每科为二十多人。苏北区的企业部门，也是这样的。一土产办事处有一百多人工作，一粮食公司的工作人员也在一百人以上，都比原编制增加两三倍之多。最典型的是淮阴市皮毛公司，这个公司有五十多人工作，而每日只收进七、八张牛皮。添一个人不是小事，每一个“供给制”干部每年要开支公粮二千多斤。而二千多斤公粮，至少要由十家农民供给。
    我认为，苏北某些单位这样不遵守中央关于机构编制的规定，是不对的，希望有关领导方面检查处理，并希望其他各地各级机构也能引起注意。
