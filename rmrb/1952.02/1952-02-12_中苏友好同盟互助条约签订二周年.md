    Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Zhang Lan
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been signed for two years. This treaty is a concrete manifestation of Chairman Mao's "leaning to one side" policy. This treaty is very unfavorable to imperialism, but extremely beneficial to the Chinese people. Without it, the US imperialism and its partners would have invaded us long ago. With this treaty, US imperialism must have reservations about invading us. Therefore, this treaty is a major blow to US imperialism. It is a bulwark of peace in the East.
    In the past, our China signed many treaties with European and American capitalist countries. Because capitalist countries have strong aggression, and our China's past governments were reactionary governments that oppressed the people, every time a treaty was signed, our China would inevitably lose some territory, some sovereignty, or some interests. But the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is not like that. Our counterpart is the socialist Soviet Union, and our government is the people's government under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, this treaty is truly signed on the basis of national equality. It is entirely suitable for the needs of the Chinese people today and fully in line with the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people. This treaty, which is in line with the patriotism of the Chinese and Soviet people and at the same time in line with the spirit of internationalism, can indeed open the eyes of all the people of the East. It points out a path for all the people of the East who are suffering from imperialist oppression and exploitation, that is, if they want to obtain true freedom and independence, they have no choice but to liberate themselves with their own hands, just like the Chinese people, and stand closely with the Soviet Union. The people of China and the Soviet Union have always had a deep friendship, although the reactionary Kuomintang government hated this friendship in the past and often wanted to destroy it. After the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary government, Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin immediately signed this treaty to further consolidate the traditional friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union in the form of a national treaty, which is of great significance to the whole world. From the time the treaty was signed, the East and the West were linked together, Europe and Asia were linked together, and the people of China and the Soviet Union had 700 million people, plus 100 million people from other people's democratic countries, we have 800 million people on the mainland. With such a large population, coupled with unlimited resources and advanced industry, and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the forces of peace have become an invincible force. We want peace and strive for peace, but if war-mongers want to take the risk of war, then they are doomed to fail.
    Recently, US imperialism has again instigated its vassal states to pass the so-called "accusation against the Soviet Union case" by the remnant bandits in Taiwan at the United Nations General Assembly, which is completely a slander! This is an insult to the people of China and the Soviet Union. The unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union cannot be destroyed by any alienation or provocation. We deeply know that in order to achieve peace, in order to ensure the freedom that our Chinese people have already obtained, we must follow Chairman Mao's "leaning to one side" policy and unite more closely with the Soviet Union. There is no "third road" or "middle road" internationally.
    Now the people of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, are striving to build a communist society, while the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are striving to build a new democratic society with the help of the allied Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. In the past two years, the strength of our two countries has been greatly enhanced. The people of China and the Soviet Union have the same goals and the same direction in construction, so the unity and cooperation between us has a solid foundation. On this second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, I call on the people of the whole country to thoroughly smash the US imperialist conspiracy to expand the war, and to further strengthen the unity and friendship between our two peoples.

    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订二周年
    张澜
    中苏友好同盟互助条约已经签订了两个周年了。这个条约是毛主席的“一边倒”的政策的具体表现。这个条约对帝国主义是很不利的，但对于中国人民却极为有利。如果没有它，美帝国主义及其伙伴一定早就来侵略我们了。有了这个条约，美帝国主义要来侵略我们就要有所顾忌。所以这个条约对美帝国主义是一个极大的打击。它是东方和平的堡垒。
    我们中国过去和欧美资本主义国家订了不少的条约。由于资本主义国家有强烈的侵略性，而我们中国过去的政府又是压迫人民的反动政府，因此每签订一次条约，我们中国就必然损失若干的国土、若干的主权或若干的利益。但是中苏友好同盟互助条约并不是如此。我们的对方是社会主义国家的苏联，而我们的政府则是共产党领导下的人民政府，因此这个条约乃是真正站在民族平等基础上签订的。它是完全适合今天我们中国人民的需要的、完全符合中国人民的爱国主义的精神的。这一个合乎中苏两国人民的爱国主义而同时又合乎国际主义精神的条约，的确可以为全东方人民打开眼界。替全东方苦于帝国主义压迫和剥削的人民指出了一条道路，那就是他们如果想获得真正的自由和独立，那他们就惟有像中国人民一样，用自己的手来解放自己，并紧密的和苏联站在一起。中苏两国人民一向都有很深厚的友谊，尽管过去反动的国民党政府曾痛恨这种友谊，常常想破坏这种友谊。国民党反动政府垮台以后，毛主席和斯大林大元帅立即签订了这个条约，以国家条约的形式，把中苏两国人民的传统的友谊更加巩固起来，这对于全世界说来都具有伟大的意义。从签订条约的时候起，东方和西方是联结起来了，欧洲和亚洲是联结起来了，中苏两国的人民就有七亿人口，再加上其他人民民主国家的一亿人口，我们在大陆上有八亿人口。以这样众多的人口，加上无限的资源和高度的工业以及全世界爱好和平人民的拥护，和平的力量就变成不可战胜的力量。我们要和平而且要极力争取和平，但如果战争贩子妄想作战争的冒险，那么他们就注定要失败。
    最近美帝国主义又指使仆从国家在联合国大会通过了台湾残匪的所谓“控苏案”，这完全是一种诽谤！这对中苏两国人民都是一种侮辱。中苏两国人民的团结和友谊是非任何离间和挑拨所能破坏的。我们深知，为了要获得和平，为了使我们中国人民所已获得的自由能得到保证，我们必须遵循毛主席的“一边倒”的政策，和苏联更加团结。国际上的“第三条路线”、“中间路线”是没有的。
    现在苏联的人民正在苏联共产党的领导下努力为建设共产主义的社会而奋斗，而我们中国人民则正在中国共产党领导下，在盟邦苏联以及其他人民民主主义国家的帮助之下为建设新民主主义的社会而努力。两年来我们两国的力量是大大增强了。中苏两国人民建设的目标相同，方向相同，因此我们间的团结和合作是有着坚实的基础的。在这中苏友好同盟互助条约签订二周年的时候，我号召全国人民为彻底粉碎美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋，并为进一步加强我们两国人民的团结和友谊而努力。
