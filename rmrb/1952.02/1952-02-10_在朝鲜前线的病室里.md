In a Hospital Room on the Korean Front
By Wu Shurong, Nursing Staff of a Lightly Wounded Soldiers Collection Team of a Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

Perhaps the people of our motherland find it difficult to imagine what a war-zone hospital on the Korean front is really like. That's what I want to tell you about. I am a nursing staff member of a lightly wounded soldiers collection team of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. I'd like to share some of my personal experiences.

We have twenty-one nurses here, all propaganda workers transferred from various units as required by the war. After a short period of study, we quickly became proficient in some nursing techniques. Air-raid shelters are the wards for the wounded and sick, scattered across a mountain gully that stretches for over half a mile. Medical equipment is lacking, so we have to find ways to make do. For example, tin cans can be turned into several things – enema bags, rice bowls, bedpans, and containers for dressings. For sterilization, we boil the instruments in the tin cans. The firewood we burn is also chopped from the mountains by us.

We are responsible for the treatment and care of sixty to seventy wounded soldiers. When the rainy season in Korea arrives, the muddy water underground is more than a foot deep. Walking back and forth between the wards, which are over half a mile apart, our shoes fill with mud, and our feet get damaged, so we go barefoot. We wring out our wet clothes and put them back on. Once, I was washing clothes for the wounded when the rain started, hitting me so hard that I couldn't open my eyes. The wind blew through my wet clothes, making me cold, and the waves surged over my feet. I squatted down tightly and scrubbed hard, trying not to let the storm stop my work. Minute by minute, I watched the dirty clothes become bright white, and I felt extremely happy. The sun came out and dried the wet clothes on my body, and then another rain soaked them again. So it went, drying and wetting, wetting and drying. Finally, my hands were chapped, and I collapsed weakly on a stone, but I knew clearly in my heart: "I am a Volunteer Army nurse; I cannot be overwhelmed by difficulties." Suddenly, I felt full of energy and finished washing the last few pieces. Counting them, there were twenty-eight pieces in total.

To prevent air raids, we not only dig our own air-raid shelters but also dig them for the wounded soldiers. Once, six of us female comrades dug an air-raid shelter more than ten feet long and four feet deep from 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM. We dug with picks and shoveled with shovels, our hands blistered, and sweat and mud turned everyone into mud figures, but no one wanted to put down their tools. When the moon shone down, Little Sun suggested, "What do you think the people of the motherland are doing right now?" This aroused everyone's interest. Some said:

"Watching a movie." Some said: "Holding peasant meetings and women's meetings, maybe planning how much to donate for airplanes and cannons." Everyone laughed. When we thought that the people of the motherland were all thinking of us Volunteers on the Korean front, we felt even more energetic. On another occasion, in four hours, we dismantled the wood from three abandoned air-raid shelters and carried these thousands of pounds of wood to another location.

These are some of the ordinary and trivial tasks we do every day. Whenever we do these things, we always remember how to actively complete the task of resisting America and aiding Korea assigned to us by the people of the motherland, so we don't feel tired or annoyed. Our work and life are full of songs. Carrying meals, carrying water buckets, walking through the mountain gullies, we sing. Squatting on the riverbank washing clothes, we also sing. Cutting vegetables and boiling water in the kitchen, we still sing. In the evening, after returning from the wards, after singing and laughing, we bring out the Yangko plays performed by the propaganda team and put on a show. Borrowing a few waist drums, we start drumming "Peng pa, peng pa," and start dancing. Every day, it's like this – working hard and living happily.

During the two months of nursing work, I got close to many heroic soldiers, and we established deep revolutionary feelings. To show their care for us, the wounded soldiers wouldn't let us wash their dirty clothes; sometimes they would even hide them. Every day, we would check them one by one, forcing them to take off their clothes and searching for the hidden dirty clothes. On rainy days, Comrade Ren Wushan would ask three people to share a basin of water to wash their faces so that we would get less rain. A young soldier nicknamed "Maozi" was naughty and playful and wouldn't let us wash his feet. Every time we washed his feet, we had to persuade him properly. When on night duty, we had to squat far away and secretly peek through the cracks in the doors and windows to see if their blankets were tucked in properly. If they found out, they would tell you to go back to sleep.

Once, Jiang Youcai called me over and asked, "Why do you always say that I am glorious and have made contributions, but you have no merit? Let's all evaluate it today." He started counting our merits one by one: "Working from dawn to dusk, either taking care of us or digging air-raid shelters, carrying wood, isn't that merit? And..."

"There's more," Platoon Leader Jiang Xiyou interrupted, "You usually work so hard, performing plays and drumming for us, and when the battle starts, you become nurses..."

"You were still bouncing little girls in the propaganda team, but when you became nurses, you could do any kind of hardship." Another said.

"If it weren't for resisting America and aiding Korea, we wouldn't be together with you. You are so good to us. When we return to the company, we will definitely tell our comrades to fight well... After we win and return to our country, I will get the comrades in our platoon to carry your backpacks..."

That's how it was. We treated them like our own brothers. They treated us like their own sisters.

In our work, we have a deeper understanding of the greatness of our soldiers. In the hospital, the wounded soldiers hope to return to the front lines. A young soldier named Huang Daohai told me almost every morning how he enjoyed beating the "Yanks" in his dreams last night. The blood vessels in his left hand were broken, and we comforted him, saying, "It's okay, you'll have surgery when you return to our motherland." He said anxiously, "How long will that take! I'm worried that I won't be able to participate in the next battle." Another nineteen-year-old soldier, Tong Zhanyun, had a very serious back injury, but he was always smiling. If it weren't for the bloodstains through his wound, no one would be able to tell that he was injured. I asked him, "Does your wound hurt?" He smiled and said, "How can it not hurt? When it hurts, you have to persevere. If you whine and groan all day, how can you be a Volunteer?" Usually, he likes to stretch his arms up and down and say, "My hand can move now; there's no problem with charging." Sitting in the ward, all we hear is talk about how that battle was fought, or how someone made contributions in that campaign. Sometimes, they use chess pieces to set up positions for us, telling us how they held the hill in that battle, how one person repelled the enemy's attacks several times. Listening to what they say, thinking of their kind and simple nature, it's hard for me to imagine. These humble, amiable, and caring soldiers, in the face of the enemy, become so full of hatred, anger, and tenacity. I clearly remember them saying to us, "Don't think we're always smiling and giving way. When the battle starts, our eyes are as big as walnuts, and we set our faces and don't say a word. You'll be scared when you see it." This is the heroic nature of our soldiers. They are the people in the world who love life and humanity the most, therefore they are also the people who can hate the enemy the most.

    在朝鲜前线的病室里
    中国人民志愿军某部轻伤收容队护理员  邬淑荣
    也许祖国人民很难想像到朝鲜前线的战地医院究竟是怎样一种情况，这就是我所想告诉你们的。我是志愿军某部轻伤收容队的一个护理员，我来谈一些我的亲身经历。
    我们这里有二十一位护理员，都是因战争的需要从各单位调来的宣传员。我们经过一个短期的学习后，很快就熟练了一些护理技术。防空洞是伤病员的病室，它分散在一里多路的山沟里。病室的用具缺乏，我们就自己想办法。比如，罐头筒子，就可以做好几种东西——做灌肠器、做饭碗、做大小便器、盛敷料。消毒时，就把器械放在罐头筒里煮。烧的木柴，也是我们从山上砍来的。
    我们担任六七十个伤员的治疗和护理工作。赶上朝鲜的雨季，地下泥水有尺多深。来回在两里路的病室转，鞋灌进了泥，脚坏了，就光着脚干。衣服淋湿拧干又穿上。有一次，我在给伤员洗衣服，雨来了，打的我睁不开眼睛，风吹透湿衣服使我发冷，波浪从脚下涌过。我紧紧地蹲着，使劲地搓，尽力不让暴风雨阻碍我的工作。时间一分一秒地过去，眼看一件件黑脏的衣服，拧出来白亮亮的，我愉快极了。太阳出来晒干了身上的湿衣，一阵雨又淋湿了。就让它这样干了又湿，湿了又干。最后，手搓破了，我无力地倒在石头上，可是心里很清楚地想到：“我是志愿军护理员，不能被困难压倒。”突然，我浑身有了劲，洗完了最后的几件。数一数，共二十八件。
    为了防空，我们不但挖自己的防空洞，也要给伤员挖。有次我们六个女同志从下午两点钟到八点钟，挖了一个一丈多长、四尺深的防空洞。一镐镐地刨，一锹锹地铲，手磨了泡，汗和泥把每个人弄成了泥人，可是谁也不愿意放下手里的工具。当月亮照上来的时候，小孙提出：“你们想祖国人民这会儿在干什么？”这下可引起了大伙的兴趣。有的说：
    “在看电影。”有的说：“在开农民会、妇女会，说不定正在计划捐献多少飞机大炮哩。”大家都笑了。我们一想到祖国人民都在怀念着我们在朝鲜前线的志愿军时，我们的劲更足了。另一次，我们在四个钟头内，拆出了三个废防空洞的木料，又把这几千斤木料搬运到了另一个地方。
    这就是我们每天所做的一些平凡琐碎的工作。每当做这些的时候，我们总记着应该如何积极完成祖国人民所交给我们的抗美援朝的任务，所以我们不知道累，不觉得烦恼。在我们的工作和生活里，充满了歌声。端着饭菜，挑着水桶，走过山沟的时候，嘴在唱。蹲在河岸洗衣服的时候，也在唱。在伙房切菜烧水的时候，还是唱。晚上从病室回来唱完笑完之后，又把宣传队演过的秧歌剧搬出来演。借几个腰鼓，就“嘭啪、嘭啪”地打起点，跳起来了。每天每天，都是这样紧张地工作，愉快地生活。
    两个月护理工作中，接近了不少英雄战士，我们之间建立了深厚的革命感情。伤病员为了体惜我们，衣服穿脏了不让洗，有时还把脏衣服藏起来。每天都是我们挨次检查，硬逼着从他们身上脱下来，把藏起的脏衣服搜出来。在下雨天，伤员任五山同志就要求三个人共使一盆洗脸水，好让我们少淋一点雨。一个外号叫“毛子”的小战士，淘气好玩，不让我们给他洗脚，每次给他洗脚总要好好地说服一番。值夜班的时候，得远远地蹲在一边，悄悄地从门窗缝里去瞧瞧他们的被子盖好没有。如果被他们发觉，他们就会叫你回去睡。
    有次，姜有才把我喊到跟前问：“你们为什么成天说我光荣有功劳，你们没功，今天大伙评评。”他就一五一十地给我们数起功劳来了：“起早摸黑，不是照顾我们，就是挖防空洞，扛木头，这不是功？再说……”
    “还多呢，”姜希有排长抢上了说，“你们往常辛辛苦苦，演剧、打腰鼓给我们看，作起战来，又做了护理员……”
    “你们在宣传队还是蹦蹦跳跳的小丫头，当了护理员，可什么吃苦的事都能干了。”又一个说。
    “不是抗美援朝，那能同你们在一块，你们对我们这样好，回到连队，一定告诉同志们好好打仗。……赶胜利后回国，我发动咱们班的同志给你们背背包……”
    就是这样，我们把他们当做亲哥哥。他们把我们当做亲妹妹。
    在我们的工作中，我们更深刻地认识到我们战士的伟大。在医院里，伤员们希望的，就是重返前线。一个青年战士叫黄道海，差不多每天早上都要告诉我，他昨晚梦里如何打“老美”打得过瘾。他的左手血管破了，我们安慰他说：“没关系，将来回祖国，动手术就会好的。”他着急地说：“那还得等多久！我着急怕下次战役我参加不了。”另一个十九岁的战士佟占云，背部伤很重，可是他整天笑呵呵的，如果不是透过伤口的血痕，谁都看不出他是一个受伤的人。我问他：“你的伤口疼不疼？”他笑笑地说：“怎么不疼？疼就要坚持。整天哼哼唧唧，那还像个志愿军？”平日他总是喜欢把胳膊伸上伸下说：“我的手能动弹了，冲锋没问题。”坐在病室听到的，不是说那次那个仗怎么打的，就是讲在那次战役中怎样立了功。有时候，他们用棋子摆起阵地给我们看，说自己在那次战斗中怎样守住山头，一个人如何打退敌人数次冲锋。听他们所说的，想平日他们那种良善、淳朴的样子，这是我以前不容易想像到的。这些谦虚、和蔼和关心体贴我们的战士，在敌人面前，又会变得那样仇恨、愤怒和顽强。我清楚地记得他们曾对我们说：“别看我们成天笑呵呵的，推三让四的。打起仗来，眼珠子瞪得核桃大，板起脸来一声不啃，你们看见才会害怕呢？”这就是我们战士的英雄本色。他们是世界上最爱生活、爱人类的人，因此他们也是最能仇恨敌人的人。
