Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 12th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the famous Soviet director Gerasimov, who is directing the Chinese famous drama "The White Haired Girl," enthusiastically discussed his views on Chinese films, dramas, and general directing art with a reporter from this agency. The contents of the conversation are as follows:

Q: Please talk about the preparation for your direction of "The White Haired Girl."

A: The rehearsal of "The White Haired Girl" is coming to an end. We have now finished rehearsing three acts, and are rehearsing the fourth act (the fourth and fifth acts have been merged). We have put in a lot of effort to translate the script into Russian so that it is suitable for the Soviet stage and for rehearsal. We learned about the life of the Chinese people from Chinese films, pictures, drawings, and other arts, especially from films such as "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," and "Daughters of China." We are also preparing to perform for the Chinese "White Haired Girl" actors and actresses, and ask them for their opinions. We are now preparing the sets, costumes, etc., and the first performance will be around mid-April.

Q: In your opinion, how should Chinese films improve in terms of ideological content and techniques?

A: The future development of Chinese films is infinitely broad. Chinese films put the interests of the people first and serve the people highly, which is their ideological content. The clarity of form and the urgency of the theme are basically present in Chinese films. Especially "Steel Warrior," the actor Zhang Ping has very high acting skills, and the director, photography, and music are all very good. This film is complete. The development of New China's films has made great achievements, and I hope to continue to move forward along this path.

Chinese drama, especially old opera, has many symbolic movements, but it is also moving on the road of realism. The images of the characters are expressed very delicately and realistically.

Ideological content and technique are inseparable. Technique without ideological content is dead. Excellent works have perfect form and content. To improve ideological content and technique, we must explore and carefully observe life. Chinese filmmakers come from the masses and should be very familiar with the material, which is a guarantee for the development of film art. We need a living, natural form that embodies life. Do not be artificial, pursue superficial effects, but be reasonable and true. Only in this way can it penetrate people's hearts and last forever.

It is important to produce biographical films of revolutionary figures, such as films about Comrade Mao Zedong and the leading figures of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. At the same time as making films on current themes, the Chinese film industry can also produce some films about the Chinese people's revolutionary struggles since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, such as films about the Long March, Yan'an, etc. This is the opinion of me and all our comrades. Because not only the Chinese people themselves, but the entire world progressive camp is very interested in the Chinese revolution.

We are also very interested in documentaries. The more frequently, more detailed, and more systematically the achievements of the Chinese people and major national events, such as land reform, resisting America and aiding Korea, etc., are reflected, the better. Films about the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea are very valuable.

In the production of feature films, it is important to deepen the thinking and express the psychological changes of people. We should deeply explore how ideological transformation is carried out. The class struggle in China is very sharp now, and it is necessary to correctly and deeply reflect this struggle, reflect the overcoming of old ideas, the establishment of new ideas, the strength and victory of new things, and so on.

It is necessary to comprehensively perform new, young characters, such as combat heroes, labor heroes, etc., and show their deeds of sacrificing personal interests for the collective and for the motherland. It is necessary to perform the new character and strong will of young people, and show that they can lead the masses, like our Chapayev.

Q: How do you achieve the simple and realistic style in the films you direct?

A: Film art is first and foremost a collective art. The achievement of a film is the achievement of all the staff. Everyone must participate and contribute. Everyone is the creator of their own career. We oppose directorial autocracy and support collective creation. Extensive educational work must be carried out among all staff, especially the director's education of the actors. The director's intonation and movements must not be forced on the actors. The political and ideological education of all staff and actors is of great significance. Only in this way can touching and realistic films be produced.

    苏联名导演格拉西莫夫
    谈我国电影、戏剧的思想性和技巧
    【新华社莫斯科十二日电】在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订二周年纪念日前夕，正在排演中国名剧“白毛女”的苏联名导演格拉西莫夫，向本社记者热情地谈述了他对中国电影、戏剧和一般导演艺术的意见。谈话的内容如下：
    问：请谈谈你导演的“白毛女”的准备情形。
    答：“白毛女”的排演快要结束了。现在我们已排完三幕，正在排第四幕（四、五两幕已经合并）。为了把剧本译成俄文，使它适合苏联舞台和进行排演，我们下了很大的功夫。我们从中国影片、图片、图画及其他艺术中，特别是从“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“中华女儿”等影片中，认识了中国人民的生活。我们还准备排演给中国的“白毛女”演员们看，请他们提意见。现在我们正在预备布景、服装等，大约在四月中就可作初次演出。
    问：你觉得中国电影在思想性和技巧上还应当怎样改进？
    答：中国电影发展的前途无限广大。中国电影把人民利益放在第一位，高度地为人民服务，这就是它的思想性。形式的明确，主题的迫切，这些因素基本上都存在于中国影片中。特别是“钢铁战士”，演员张平有很高的演技，导演、摄影和配乐都很好。这个片子是完整的。新中国电影的发展有很大的成绩，希望循着这条道路向前走去。
    中国戏剧，特别是旧剧有不少象征动作，但是它也走在现实主义的道路上。人物的形象表现得非常细腻和真实。
    思想性和技巧是不可分离的东西。没有思想性的技巧是死的。优秀的作品都有完美的形式和内容。要提高思想性和技巧，就要探究地、注意地观察生活。中国电影工作者是从群众中来的，当会很熟悉材料，这就是发展电影艺术的保证。要活的、自然的、体现生活的形式。不要做作、追逐外表效果，要合理和真实。这样才能深入人心，历久不泯。
    制作革命人物传记的影片，像关于毛泽东同志以及中国共产党和中国人民领导人物的影片，是重要的。和制作当前主题的影片同时，中国电影界也可以制作一些关于太平天国以来中国人民革命斗争的影片，如关于长征、延安的影片等等，这是我和我们全体同志的意见。因为不但中国人民自己，而且整个世界进步阵营都对中国革命有很大的兴趣。
    我们对纪录片也有很大兴趣。愈经常、愈详细、愈有系统地反映中国人民的业迹和国家大事，例如土地改革、抗美援朝等，就愈好。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜英勇斗争的影片，是非常宝贵的。
    在制作故事片中，重要的是向深处加深思想，表达人的心理变化。应当深刻地探究思想改造是怎样进行的。现在中国的阶级斗争很尖锐，必须正确地、深入地反映这个斗争，反映旧思想的克服、新思想的确立、新事物的力量和胜利等等。
    需要全面演出新的、年青的人物，像战斗英雄、劳动英雄等，表现他们为集体、为祖国而牺牲个人利益的事迹。要演出青年人的新性格、坚强意志，演出他能够领导群众，像我们的夏伯阳那样。
    问：你所导演的片子中那种朴素真实的风格是怎样做到的？
    答：电影艺术首先是集体的艺术。片子的成就是全体人员的成就。必须人人都参加而且有所贡献。每个人是自己事业的创造者。我们反对导演专制，而拥护集体创作。必须在全体人员中进行巨大的教育工作，特别是导演对演员的教育。不能把导演的腔调动作强加在演员的身上。全体人员和演员的政治和思想教育，有着重大的意义。只有这样才能产生感人的、真实的影片。
