    Modify Cotton Gin to Improve Ginning Efficiency
    Comrade Editor: Last summer, the employees of the Shijiazhuang Liangmian Cotton Ginning Factory modified all the 32-inch roller cotton gins into 36-inch roller cotton gins. This type of cotton gin has very high efficiency. In addition, the employees adopted the method of "feeding less, feeding evenly, and feeding fully" in the cotton feeding work, which increased the ginning volume of each cotton gin to 168 jin per hour. According to the investigation, such ginning efficiency is quite high in the country. The employees installed a seed-pulling channel on the ginning machine, which allows the cotton seeds to automatically rise into the seed-screening machine. The employees raised the seed-screening machine, so that the screened cotton seeds are automatically loaded into different baskets. In this way, a lot of manual labor for shoveling and loading seeds is saved. Last year, this factory cleaned more than 45,000 jin of cotton seeds every day, using seven male workers. This year, it cleans more than 62,000 jin of cotton seeds every day, using only five male workers. I think this method of modifying the cotton gin is worth popularizing. Shang Wen

    石家庄良棉轧花厂职工
    改装轧花车提高轧花效率
    编辑同志：去年夏季，石家庄良棉轧花厂职工，把所有的三十二吋辊轴轧花车改装成三十六吋辊轴轧花车。这种轧花车的效率很高，再加上职工们在喂花工作上采取了“喂少、喂匀、喂满”的方法，使每辆轧花车每小时的轧花量提高到一百六十八斤。据调查，这样的轧花效率在全国来说是相当高的。职工们在轧花机上，安装了拉籽道，可使棉籽自动上升入筛籽机；职工们把筛籽机架高了，使筛出的棉籽自动分别装筐。这样，就节省了很多铲籽装籽的人工。去年，这个厂每日清理棉籽四万五千多斤，用七个男工；今年每日清理棉籽六万二千多斤，只用五个男工。我认为这个改装轧花车的办法，是值得推广的。  尚文
