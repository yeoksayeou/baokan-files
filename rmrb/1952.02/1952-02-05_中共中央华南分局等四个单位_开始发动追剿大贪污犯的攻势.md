Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 4th: The CCP Central Committee South China Bureau, the South China Branch of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Administrative Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government have begun to launch an offensive to hunt down major embezzlers.

Over the past month, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in the four major units has achieved significant results. During the democratic inspection leadership phase from early January to January 20th, three main achievements were made: First, the smuggling and tax evasion of some personnel in the agencies, which seriously violated national laws and regulations, were exposed and corrected. Second, extravagance and waste, the enemy of national industrialization, was attacked. For example, the extravagant and wasteful behavior of the General Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government was opposed by everyone. The office had less than two hundred staff members, but it spent more than 10 billion yuan on constructing buildings. Some of the buildings were torn down and rebuilt because the "appearance" was not "grand" enough. A large number of furniture was bought from Hong Kong instead of using the existing furniture, and a large number of unnecessary items such as pianos, film projectors, billiard tables, swimming suits, and even cosmetics were purchased. The total cost of purchasing furniture reached 3.5 billion yuan, which is equivalent to the annual harvest of 10,000 farmers in Guangdong; this amount could equip 1,000 spindles if invested in industrial construction. In each agency, extravagant waste and the squandering of funds by leading cadres beyond the system were sharply criticized. Third, the bureaucratic style of being detached from the masses and suppressing democracy suffered a heavy blow. After the masses rose up and launched fierce criticism, the suffocating phenomenon in the agencies where the voices of the masses could not reach the top was eliminated, and it was replaced by a vibrant democratic atmosphere. Leading cadres who suppressed democracy in the movement were criticized or even dismissed by higher leading organs. For example, Zou Ping, Director of the Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture and Education, and Liu Nan, Director of the Office of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Transportation, were punished for this reason. In addition, individual leading cadres with major embezzlement behaviors also received the punishment they deserved.

From January 20th to the end of January, the movement entered the stage of mass-based confession and denunciation against corruption. During this period, many agencies held one or two mass meetings to call for denunciation, set a deadline for confession, and combined group reflection, key investigation, and individual interviews to help embezzlers confess. Some agencies also held family forums, staff representative meetings, female worker forums, invited capitalists from relevant factories and shops to meetings, and held joint struggle rallies with agencies of similar nature to mobilize the masses and organize struggle teams to fight against embezzlers. These mass meetings, large and small, had good results. For example, the Provincial Department of Commerce and its nine professional companies held a joint struggle rally, and the masses denounced 156 embezzlers on the spot.

However, at present, very few major embezzlers have been captured, and the imbalance of the movement still exists seriously. The main reason is that the leading cadres of some agencies either have unclean hands and have not made a confession that satisfies the masses, or have not led the masses to continue to move forward after the confession, and have unilaterally understood the meaning of "leaders taking the lead" as passively "getting through."

In order to implement the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, under the leadership of the CCP Central Committee South China Bureau, the four major units have recently taken the following emergency measures to launch a powerful offensive to continue to eliminate all embezzlers, with the main focus on hunting down major embezzlers: (1) Ye Jianying, Fang Fang, and Tao Zhu, leaders of the CCP Central Committee South China Bureau, have gone to the Party committee agencies of the province, city, and South China Branch of the Central and Southern Financial and Economic Committee to directly command operations. (2) The leading organs of the four major units have formed eleven strong inspection teams to go to key agencies to help mobilize the masses and organize struggle teams, and to conduct special investigations into major embezzlement cases where clues have been discovered. (3) The heads of all agencies are instructed to take serious responsibility, personally take action, and be sure to catch the "big tigers." Leading cadres who are still unwilling to confess clearly when problems arise, causing the movement to fail to move forward, or who are passively derelict in their anti-corruption struggle, will be dismissed and investigated. Leading cadres who adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards the movement, whitewashing the situation, will be punished for dereliction of duty or shielding criminals if major embezzlers are found in the future. (4) Each agency stipulates a deadline for confession. Those who do not confess before the deadline and are denounced will be severely punished. Embezzlers who confess thoroughly are welcome to participate in the struggle and atone for their crimes with merit.

At the same time, a front against bribery, tax evasion, fraud, and theft has been opened in the business community. Before the Spring Festival, mobilization rallies for workers, shop assistants, youth, women, and students were held, and the business community also held a representative meeting. The struggle team of patriotic people in the city, including legitimate and law-abiding industrialists and businessmen, has begun to take shape. The Municipal People's Representative Conference held on January 31st was an action signal to launch a struggle against illegal industrialists and businessmen after extensive mobilization. At present, the confession movement in the business community and the denunciation movement of people from all walks of life have begun. The opening of this new front will greatly benefit the current large-scale campaign by various agencies to hunt down major embezzlers.

    中共中央华南分局等四个单位  
    开始发动追剿大贪污犯的攻势
    【新华社广州四日电】中共中央华南分局、中南军政委员会财政经济委员会华南分会、广东省人民政府和广州市人民政府所属各机关已开始发动追剿大贪污分子的攻势。
    一个多月来，四大单位的反贪污、反浪费和反官僚主义运动的成绩是显著的。在一月初到一月二十日的民主检查领导阶段中，获得了三项主要成绩：首先揭发并纠正了一些机关人员的走私漏税，严重违反国家法纪的行为。其次，打击了铺张浪费这个国家工业化的敌人。如广东省人民政府办公厅的铺张浪费行为受到了大家的反对。该厅工作人员不到两百人，可是用了一百多亿元大事修建房屋，其中有几幢房子因为“观瞻”不够“堂皇”，修了又拆，拆了再修。许多现成家具不用，从香港买回来大批家具，还买了许多像钢琴、电影机、桌球、游泳衣以至化妆品等完全不需要的东西。总计购置家具费用达三十五亿元，等于广东一万农民全年的收获；拿来建设工业可装备一千个纱锭。在每个机关里，铺张浪费现象和领导干部挥霍性的超制度开支，都受到尖锐的批评。第三，脱离群众、压抑民主的官僚主义作风受到沉重的打击。群众起来猛烈展开批评之后，机关内已消除了群众呼声不能上达的窒息现象，代之以朝气蓬勃的民主气氛。凡在运动中压制民主的领导干部都受到上级领导机关的批评以至撤职的处分。例如市人民政府文教局局长邹屏、省人民政府交通厅办公室主任柳南等都因此受到处分。此外，有重大贪污行为的个别领导干部，也受到应得的处分。
    由一月二十日到一月底，运动进入群众性反贪污的坦白、检举阶段。在这期间，许多机关开过一次或两次群众大会，号召检举，限期坦白，并结合小组反省、重点追查、个别谈话等办法，帮助贪污分子进行坦白。有些机关还举行家属座谈会、工作人员代表会、女职工座谈会，邀集有关工厂、商店的资本家开会以及同性质的机关开联合斗争大会等，发动群众，组织斗争队伍，来和贪污分子作斗争。这些群众性的大会小会有很好效果，如省商业厅和所属九个专业公司举行联合斗争大会，群众当场检举了一百五十六个贪污分子。
    但是目前大贪污分子被搜捕出来的还很少，运动的不平衡状态还严重存在，主要原因是有些机关的领导干部或因手头不干净而又没有作出使群众满意的检讨，或在检讨后没有带领群众继续前进，把“首长亲自动手”的意义片面了解为消极“过关”。
    为贯彻反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，在中共中央华南分局领导下，四大单位已在最近采取了下列紧急措施，开展以追剿大贪污分子为主继续肃清一切贪污分子的强大攻势。（一）中共中央华南分局的领导人叶剑英、方方、陶铸已分别到省、市和中南财经委员会华南分会的党委机关，直接指挥作战。（二）四大单位的领导机关已组成十一个强有力的检查小组，到达各重点机关，帮助发动群众和组织斗争队伍，并对已发现线索的重大贪污案件进行专案检查。（三）责成各机关首长认真负责，亲自动手，务要抓住“大老虎”。遇有问题仍然不愿交代清楚致使运动不能前进或对反贪污斗争消极失职的领导干部，一律撤职查办。遇有对运动采取官僚主义态度，粉饰无事的领导干部，在以后查出大贪污犯时，一律以失职或包庇论罪。（四）各机关规定坦白期限，过期不坦白被检举出来的，加重处罚。欢迎彻底坦白的贪污分子参加斗争，戴罪立功。
    与此同时，在工商界开辟了反行贿、反偷漏、反欺诈、反盗窃的战线。春节前已举行了工人、店员、青年、妇女、学生的动员大会，工商界也举行了代表大会，包括正当守法的工商业者在内的全市爱国人民的斗争队伍已开始形成。一月三十一日举行的市各界人民代表会议就是在广泛动员之后，向不法的工商业者展开斗争的行动信号。目前工商界的坦白运动和各阶层人民的检举运动已经开始，这一条新的战线的开辟，将大大有利于目前各机关追剿大贪污分子的大进军。
