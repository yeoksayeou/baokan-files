Dear fellow compatriots of the capital, respected leaders, and comrades:

    Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation is about to leave the great capital of our motherland and travel to various parts of the country to thank the people of the motherland for their support and to report on the situation at the front. Here, I would like to bid a fond farewell to the comrades of the various organs and troops in the capital, to the leaders, and to the fellow compatriots, and to thank you all for your warm welcome and love!

    During our thirteen days in the capital, every returning representative of the Volunteer Army has felt boundless warmth and happiness. In the midst of the intense movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, over 122,000 people in the capital met with us. We reported to you on the struggle in Korea and visited the wounded and sick Volunteer Army soldiers in the capital. Whether workers, farmers, soldiers, students, or people from other walks of life, all came to shake our hands, warmly surrounded us, even lifted us up, asked after our well-being, and showed us utmost concern. You praised us, the entire commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the most beloved people, which made us deeply feel how glorious it is to be a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! How warm and lovable are the people of our great motherland!

    Dear fellow compatriots of the capital! We are truly grateful to you. We have personally seen that under the direct guidance of Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the people of the capital, in the movement of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country," are truly united as one, working tirelessly day and night in various posts. Whether in patriotic donations, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, especially in the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, you have made brilliant achievements, powerfully supporting the front lines. This has deeply moved every one of us who has returned from the Korean front, and our confidence in victory has been further enhanced.

    It should also be mentioned that on the afternoon of January 23, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai, along with other central leaders, received our delegation. Vice Chairman Zhu and Premier Zhou gave us much encouragement and valuable instructions. We believe that all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army will respond to the expectations of the leaders with practical actions.

    During the thirteen days in the capital, we were with our compatriots and comrades, and everywhere we were filled with boundless love and encouragement. We will certainly carry this boundless love and encouragement into our work, and bring the situation and spirit of the vigorous movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy of the people of the capital to all parts of the country and report it to the comrades on the front lines! We believe that this will greatly strengthen the power to strike against the American aggressors.

    Goodbye! Dear fellow compatriots of the capital, respected leaders, and comrades!

    Let us wish Chairman Mao good health!

    Wish the people of the capital, the leaders, and the comrades a happy new year! Wish you greater achievements in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy!

    我们中国人民志愿军归国代表团，就要离开伟大的祖国首都，分途到全国各地，答谢祖国人民对我们的支援和报告前线情况了。在这里，谨向首都各机关、部队同志、各首长和各界同胞，作一次亲切的告别，感谢大家对我们的热诚欢迎和爱戴！
    在首都十三天当中，我们每一个志愿军归国代表，都感到了无限的温暖和幸福。在紧张的增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中，首都十二万二千多人和我们见了面。我们向大家报告了朝鲜的斗争情况，慰问了在首都的志愿军伤病员。不管是工人、农民、战士、学生和其他各界人士，都来握我们的手，热情地把我们围起来，甚至把我们抬起来，问寒问暖，关怀备至。你们称赞我们中国人民志愿军全体指战员是中国人民的优秀儿女，是最可爱的人，使我们深深地感觉到作为一个中国人民志愿军的战士是多么光荣！我们伟大祖国的人民是多么热情可爱！
    亲爱的首都各界同胞们！我们实在感谢你们，我们亲自看到，首都人民在毛主席的直接指导之下，在北京市人民政府领导之下，在“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的运动中，真正万众一心，日夜不懈地在各种岗位上，紧张地工作着。不管是爱国捐献、镇压反革命、特别是在增产节约反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中，都有了光辉的成就，有力地支援了前线。这使我们每一个从朝鲜前线归来的人，深受感动，而我们的胜利信心，也因此更加提高。
    还应当提到的是：一月二十三日下午，朱德副主席和周恩来总理及中央其他的首长，接见了我们代表团。朱副主席和周总理给了我们许多的勉励和宝贵的指示。我们相信志愿军全体指战员都会以实际行动，来回答首长们的期望。
    在首都的十三天，我们和同胞们、同志们在一起，到处对我们都充满了无限的热爱和勉励。我们一定把这无限的热爱和勉励，贯彻到工作中去，把首都人民轰轰烈烈抗美援朝、增产节约和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的情况和精神带到全国各地，报告给前线的同志们！我们相信这一定会大大地加强对美国侵略者打击的力量。
    再见！亲爱的首都各界同胞、各位首长、各位同志！
    让我们祝福毛主席的健康！
    祝福首都各界人民、各位首长、各位同志新春愉快！祝你们在增产节约和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中获得更大的成就！
