Experiences in Tuberculosis Recovery
傅连暲

Thirty years ago, I was a severe tuberculosis patient, bedridden for two years due to tuberculosis, suffering from fever, hemoptysis, emaciation, and weakness. Many people thought I wouldn't live long, and I thought so myself. At that time, I had not yet joined the revolution, and like countless young people wandering in the old society, I was suffering from mental and physical torment.

I was born into a poor working-class family in the old society, and life was very difficult. The room I lived in did not get sunlight and fresh air, let alone cleanliness and nutrition. Although my parents were strong laborers, they could not take care of my health. In addition, when I was in school, I worked and studied part-time, and life was very hard. After graduating from medical school, the work was heavy, which further weakened my resistance. I have witnessed many promising young people who, due to the social environment at the time, could not get medical treatment when they were sick and were mentally depressed, leading to the loss of their future and their lives. I, however, was rescued by the revolution on the verge of death and gained a new life.

The history of my struggle with disease is inseparable from the history of my struggle for the revolution. I am now willing to tell everyone about my experiences in fighting tuberculosis.

In the past, I was an individualistic freelancer. I was busy all day long, ostensibly for the sake of health and serving society, but basically out of narrow personal views and local concepts. In the course of my work, I was often worried about gains and losses and often troubled myself with trivial matters, carrying a lot of ideological baggage. In 1925, the "May 30th" patriotic movement broke out, and I first came into contact with communism and gained new inspiration. After the Nanchang Uprising in 1927, I personally treated the revolutionary wounded and directly participated in the Red Army's medical work. I began to have close contact with revolutionary comrades. Influenced by them, I recognized the essence of national oppression and class exploitation, criticized my petty-bourgeois old views, and saw the great future of communism. My vision broadened, my thinking developed, I abandoned all material and ideological baggage, and joined the revolution. I completely dedicated myself to the revolution and put life and death out of my mind. As a result, my body was saved.

After joining the revolution, I entered a war environment, went through the 25,000-li Long March, and crossed the snowy mountains and grasslands. Not only did I not die, but I became healthier day by day. What is the reason for this? The reason is that I gained a revolutionary outlook on life. I entrusted myself to the people, and I integrated my future with the future of the revolution. I discarded concerns based on personal interests, and I no longer had any worries about gains and losses, hesitation, or distress. Since I was no longer stuck in a narrow personal circle, I was naturally very happy.

Of course, I am not saying that my recovery was entirely due to ideological liberation and mental therapy, without relying on medical assistance and attention to diet and daily life; I am saying that ideological liberation was a starting point and an important key to my physical improvement. I am a doctor myself, and I deeply realize that I overcame tuberculosis, on the one hand, because of effective medical treatment, and on the other hand, because my thinking was on the right track.

Over the past thirty years, I have had the following experiences with drug treatment and rest methods for tuberculosis:

First, I have tried tuberculin injections for a long time, gradually increasing from one in 100,000 to nine-tenths. Under careful attention, no serious side effects occurred. I believe that tuberculin is effective for early tuberculosis, especially in the absence of fever. However, today, drugs like streptomycin PAS are indeed much more effective than tuberculin for certain tuberculosis cases, and with less risk. Therefore, I do not advocate tuberculin now. In addition, I believe that artificial pneumothorax and artificial pneumoperitoneum, if applied well, have an auxiliary therapeutic effect. I have not undergone these surgical treatments myself; this is just my experience from others. I believe that in the future, "anti-tuberculosis drugs" with better efficacy than streptomycin will inevitably be invented, and due to early diagnosis and early treatment, surgical treatment may not be necessary in the future.

Second, many symptomatic treatments can relieve pain and increase resistance, so they are also effective. The specific methods and what medicines to use should be determined by an experienced doctor based on the patient's current symptoms, and cannot be generalized. Do not easily believe the drugs advertised in advertisements.

Third, finding ways to ensure sufficient sleep and peace of mind is of great help in the treatment of tuberculosis. Many people ask me about the advantages and disadvantages of using sleeping pills. My answer is: appropriate use is very beneficial. Although I do not casually recommend sleeping pills to others or advocate sleeping pills, based on my own experience, sleeping pills have indeed played a significant role in protecting my health. Due to busy work, I often suffer from insomnia, and for thirty years, I have often needed to resort to sleeping pills. Many diseases are effective with sleep therapy, which has been proven in Soviet medicine, and I deeply believe in this.

Fourth, no disease can completely rely on drug treatment, especially for tuberculosis. Before many drugs and surgical treatments were invented, the general treatment for tuberculosis advocated rest, nutrition, sunlight, and fresh air. Today, although there are many special therapies, these four precautions are still very important. My experience is: 1. When there are symptoms such as fever, hemoptysis, severe cough, and night sweats, be sure to rest quietly in bed. After the symptoms disappear (such as good appetite, normal body temperature, weight gain, erythrocyte sedimentation rate trending towards normal, no tuberculosis bacteria in sputum, and X-ray examination showing the lesions have stopped being active), you can slowly get up and move around. But activity should be moderate, gradually increasing with the improvement of physical condition. 2. Strengthen nutrition when it does not hinder gastrointestinal digestion and conditions permit. 3. The room should have plenty of sunlight, but do not directly bask in the sun. 4. Fresh air is absolutely necessary.

Fifth, pay attention to preventing other diseases. Even a cold or a general gastrointestinal disease should be carefully prevented, because even a minor illness is enough to weaken physical strength and create opportunities for the activity of tuberculosis. Over the years, I have paid great attention to cold and heat and diet.

Sixth, recuperation is like any other discipline, it requires cultivation. I am a patient, and I know very well that recuperation should not be rushed. Do not be discouraged and disappointed because the condition has slightly reversed or the treatment is not very effective. You must understand, explore, and find the rules. Only by turning the doctor's scientific guidance into your own common sense of recuperation and living habits can you say that you have found the secret. I am also a doctor, and I know very well that when treating patients, you must be patient and never act hastily or make conclusions easily. You must carefully investigate and study; moreover, you must not be impatient and express dissatisfaction when the patient slightly resists, but must patiently guide and show meticulous care. The doctor must be the patient's teacher, student, and friend. The patient must have confidence and patience, and the doctor must have confidence and patience. The combination of the two can overcome the disease. In other words, the patient must have a revolutionary optimistic attitude, and the doctor must have a revolutionary humanitarian spirit. The combination of the two can overcome the disease.

The above is my experience. To make it clearer, I may as well repeat two of the most important issues:

The first issue is the issue of ideology. You have to think it through and be open-minded. How can you think it through and be open-minded? Focusing on personal problems and not looking far ahead will inevitably lead to getting stuck in a dead end, not being able to think it through, and thus causing yourself distress, which affects your health. If you truly establish a revolutionary outlook on life and proceed from serving the people in everything, you will not have distress, only happiness.

The second issue is the issue of rest and work. Rest is very important, but after the disease has stopped, there should be appropriate labor. This appropriate labor is not only harmless to the body but also beneficial. On the other hand, you must also strive for rest at any time during work. I believe that it is very important for a person with a weak body or a person who works a lot to take a nap every day. Even if you can't fall asleep, closing your eyes and lying quietly for half an hour to an hour will always be beneficial. This is my experience over the years.

People with tuberculosis must believe that tuberculosis is not terrible and can be cured. I am an example myself. But the harm of tuberculosis to people should not be ignored. To eliminate tuberculosis, we must start with prevention. In addition to the national tuberculosis prevention measures, personal hygiene is very important. If everyone understands the principles of tuberculosis transmission and everyone knows how to prevent tuberculosis, then tuberculosis will naturally be difficult to wreak havoc. It is the doctor's responsibility to conduct widespread publicity to prevent tuberculosis. I myself do not give up any opportunity to do this kind of publicity.

With the development of the new society and with the increase in people's knowledge of disease prevention, I believe that tuberculosis will gradually decrease in China. Moreover, from the perspective of all mankind, with the demise of imperialism in the world and with the unlimited development of human culture, science, and happy life, I believe that tuberculosis will be completely eliminated by mankind. At that time, the words "tuberculosis" will become a historical term.

    肺结核疗养的经验
    傅连暲
    三十年前，我曾经是一个严重的肺结核患者，曾经因肺结核病卧床两年，发热咯血，消瘦无力。许多人都认为我活不久了，我自己也是这样想。那时候我还没有参加革命，和无数彷徨在旧社会的青年们一样，我在受着精神和身体的折磨。
    我出身于旧社会贫困劳动人民之家，生活非常困苦，住室得不到阳光和新鲜空气，更谈不到什么清洁营养。尽管父母是健壮的劳动者，但对我的健康却无法顾及。加之，我在学校的时候，半工半读，生活非常艰苦。医校毕业后，工作繁重，更削弱了我的抵抗力。我曾经目睹许多有为的青年，都是由于当时的社会环境，有病无法就医，精神郁闷，以至丧失了前途、丧失了生命。我却在濒死的路途中，由于革命对我的解救，获得了新生。
    我和疾病斗争的历史，是和我为革命奋斗的历史分不开的。我现在愿意把我和肺结核病斗争的经验告诉大家。
    过去，我是一个个人主义的自由职业者。我整天奔波劳碌，虽然说是为了卫生事业，为了服务社会，但基本上还是出于狭隘的个人观点和地方观念。工作中间，患得患失，经常为琐碎事情而自寻烦恼，思想包袱很多。一九二五年“五卅”爱国运动爆发，我初次接触到了共产主义，获得了新的启发。一九二七年南昌起义后，我亲自医治了革命的伤病员，直接参加了红军医疗工作，我和革命同志开始发生了密切的联系。我受了他们的影响，认识了民族压迫阶级剥削的本质，批判了自己的小资产阶级的旧观点，看出了共产主义的伟大前途。我的眼光扩大了，思想开展了，我抛弃了一切物质上和思想上的包袱，参加了革命，我把自己完全贡献给了革命，我把生死置之度外。然而也即因此，我的身体从此得救。
    参加革命之后，我走入了战争环境，经过了两万五千里长征，踏过了雪山草地，不仅没有死，反而一天天地健康起来。这是什么原因呢？原因就在于我获得了革命的人生观，我把我自己交给了人民，我把自己的前途和革命的前途融成了一片，我丢弃了从个人利益出发的顾虑，我并没有什么患得患失彷徨苦闷的心情了。我既然不在狭窄的个人小圈子里打转，自然就很愉快。
    当然我并不是说，我恢复健康完全没有依靠医药的帮助和饮食起居的注意，而仅仅由于思想的解放和精神的治疗；我是说，思想的解放是我的身体转好的一个起点，一个重要的关键。我自己是一个医生，我深深体会到：我战胜了肺结核，一方面固然由于医疗得法，另一方面则由于思想走入了正轨。
    三十年来，对于肺结核的药物治疗和休息方法，我有如下的经验：
    第一、我曾长期试用过结核菌素注射，由十万分之一逐渐增加到十分之九，在小心注意之下，没有发生什么严重的副作用。我认为结核菌素对于初期的肺结核，特别是在无热的情况下，是有效的。不过在今天来说，像链霉素PAS药对某些结核病，确比结核菌素的效力要好得多，而且很少危险。因此，现在我并不提倡结核菌素。此外如人工气胸术、人工气腹术，我认为如应用得好，有辅助治疗作用，我自己没有经过这些手术治疗，这只是我从别人获得的经验。我相信，将来必然会发明比链霉素功效更好的“灭痨素”，而且由于早期诊断，早期治疗，手术疗法将来可能没有必要。
    第二、很多对症疗法，可以减轻痛苦，增加抵抗力，所以也很有效。具体办法和用什么药剂应由有经验的医生根据病人当时的症状来决定，不可一概而论。广告上所宣传的那些药品，切不可轻信。
    第三、设法使睡眠充足和心神安定，对肺结核治疗帮助极大。有很多人问我，用安眠药的利弊到底如何，我的回答是：适当使用，非常有益。我虽不随便向人介绍安眠药，提倡安眠药，但以我自身体会，安眠药确实在保护我的健康上起了不小的作用。由于工作繁忙，我常患失眠，三十年来，我常常需要求助于安眠药。许多病因用睡眠疗法而生效，在苏联医学上已得到证明，我对此尤为深信。
    第四、任何病都不能完全依赖药物治疗，对于肺结核，尤其如此。在许多药物和手术疗法发明之前，一般对结核的治疗是提倡休息、营养、阳光和新鲜空气，今天虽然已经有了不少的特殊疗法，这四项注意仍非常重要。我的经验是：一、有发热、咯血、剧烈咳嗽、出盗汗等症状时，一定要安静卧床休息，病状消失之后（如食欲良好，体温正常，体重增加，血沉趋于正常，痰中结核菌绝迹，X光检查病变已停止活动者），可以慢慢起来活动。但活动要适可而止，随身体情况之进步，渐渐增加。二、在不妨碍胃肠消化及条件许可时要加强营养。三、室内要有充足阳光，但不可直接晒太阳。四、新鲜空气，绝对必要。
    第五、要注意防止其他疾病，那怕是感冒或者一般的胃肠病也要加意预防，因为那怕是小病也足以使体力减弱，给结核病的活动造成机会。多年来我对于冷热和饮食都非常注意。
    第六、养病就如任何一门学问，要有修养。我是病人，我深知养病不可急躁。不要因病状稍有逆转或治疗见效不大而即灰心失望，必须体会摸索，寻找规律。只有把医生的科学指导，变成自己的养病常识和生活习惯，才可以说是得到了秘诀。我又是医生，我深知对待病人，切要耐心，切不可草率从事，轻易定案，而必须仔细调查研究；更不可暴躁从事，病人稍有违抗，即表示不满，而必须循循善诱，体贴至微。医生必须是病人的先生，又是病人的学生，又是病人的朋友。病人要有信心有耐心，医生更要有信心有耐心，两者结合起来，就能战胜疾病。换句话说，病人要抱着革命的乐观主义态度，医生要抱着革命的人道主义精神，两者结合起来，才能战胜疾病。
    以上，是我的经验。为了说得更明白，我不妨把其中两个最重要的问题再重复说几句：
    第一个问题是思想问题。要想得通，想得开。怎样才能想得通，想得开呢？专在个人问题上转小圈子，不把眼光放远，其结果一定是钻牛角，想不通，因而自寻苦恼，影响身体。如果真正建立了革命人生观，事事从为人民服务出发，就不会有苦恼，只会有愉快。
    第二个问题是休息和工作的问题。休息很重要，但疾病停止之后，就应有适当的劳动，这种适当的劳动对身体不仅无害，反而有益。另一方面在工作中也必须随时争取休息。我认为，一个身体弱的人或工作多的人，每天睡午觉是很重要的，睡不着也不要紧，闭上眼睛，静卧半小时到一小时，总会有益处，这是我多年的体验。
    有结核病的人一定要相信结核并不可怕，可以治好，我自己就是一个例子。但结核病对人的危害，切不可漠视。要消灭结核病，一定要从预防着手。除去国家的防痨措施之外，个人卫生非常重要。如果每个人都懂得结核传染的道理，每个人都懂得怎样预防结核，结核就自然难以逞其猖狂。做防止结核病的广泛宣传，是医生的应有责任。我自己是不放弃任何机会做这种宣传的。
    随着新社会的发展，随着人们预防疾病知识的增加，我相信，结核病在中国一定会逐渐减少。而且，从全人类来看，随着帝国主义在世界上的灭亡，随着人类文化科学和幸福生活的无限发展，我相信，结核病一定会被人类彻底消灭。那时候结核病三字将成为历史上的名词。
