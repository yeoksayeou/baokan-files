Many economic agencies and enterprise departments in the Southwest Region, during the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, discovered a group of "moles" sent by unscrupulous merchants. They stole economic intelligence, spied on state secrets, undermined and seduced our personnel from within, and used despicable inside-outside collusion to achieve the shameless goal of stealing state assets. They turned our economic agencies into nests of corruption and tools for exploiting the people. The Native Produce Company, Department Store Company, and Basic Construction Office under the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee discovered a series of such facts.

Last August, the price of gallnuts (a type of medicinal material) rose in the Chongqing market. State trading agencies decided to sell a large quantity through the Native Produce Company to stabilize or lower the price of gallnuts. Zhang Zhixiang, the staff member responsible for this work, reported the news to Lida Mountain Goods Store and helped Lida Mountain Goods Store buy all the gallnuts sold by the Native Produce Company. At that time, the market price had already risen to 275,000 yuan per dan, but Zhang Zhixiang sold them at 263,000 yuan per dan. At the same time, knowing that the state no longer had the power to lower the price of this commodity, they desperately rushed to the market to buy it up. After a large number of goods were in hand, they raised the already high price to 320,000 yuan per dan. Zhang Zhixiang and Lida Mountain Goods Store thus used the state's price-reducing policy to make prices soar. The people suffered immeasurable losses, while they gained a staggering profit of over 100 million yuan. Another case is: When the price of peach kernels at the place of origin was too low and the price at the sales destination was too high, the state trading agency decided to purchase directly from the place of origin to raise the price of peach kernels and protect the interests of producers. However, Qiu Yaoting, an employee of the Native Produce Company, reported this economic intelligence to Yuchang Dried Vegetable Store, enabling them to arrive at the place of origin one step ahead and purchase a large quantity before the arrival of the state purchasing personnel, thereby seizing the initiative in the peach kernel market. When the peach kernels were recovered, the state-owned company decided to sell them, but Yuchang Dried Vegetable Store, under the guidance of Qiu Yaoting, dumped their stock one step ahead, preventing the state-owned company from selling a large number of peach kernels. This batch of peach kernels caused the Native Produce Company to lose 95.6 million yuan in profits and interest. In August of the same year, when the Native Produce Company purchased daylilies, the market price was 340,000 yuan per dan. However, Qiu Yaoting purchased a large quantity from private merchants such as Yuchang at a price of 400,000 yuan per dan, which was equivalent to openly giving over 13 million yuan of public funds from the Native Produce Company to private merchants. It turned out that Zhang Zhixiang and Qiu Yaoting were both specially sent by unscrupulous merchants. Qiu Yaoting was originally a reliable "apprentice" of the privately-owned Yuchang Dried Vegetable Store. He was sent by Yuchang Dried Vegetable Store to infiltrate the Native Produce Company last March when the company was recruiting staff. According to Qiu Yaoting, he had disclosed the secrets of eight kinds of commodities, all of which seriously damaged the interests of the people and the state. In the Native Produce Company, several employees were also found to have been sent by unscrupulous merchants, some of whom were nephews, younger brothers, or relatives of private merchants. For example, Xiong Guangshi of the Mountain Goods Section of the Native Produce Company's retail department was admitted to the company through collusion between his father (a mountain goods merchant) and Luo Guozhen, a shareholder of the privately-owned Heji Cigarette Shop in Wanxian, with Luo acting as his guarantor. In mid-April of last year, a few days before the Native Produce Company was about to increase the selling price of local tobacco, Xiong Guangshi quickly sold 100 cases of local tobacco to Heji Cigarette Shop at the original price, causing the company to lose more than 8 million yuan. In August of the same year, the market price of shredded tobacco raw materials was 720,000 yuan per dan, but Xiong Guangshi sold 305 dan to the unscrupulous merchant Gou Deming at a price of 710,000 yuan per dan, causing the company to lose 3.05 million yuan. Last year, the Native Produce Company had a large stock of willow tobacco that was difficult to sell; however, when the state-owned Hubei Sha Daoguan Department Store came to buy goods, Xiong Guangshi instead introduced the purchasing personnel to Fuqun Tobacco Shop, where his father worked, to purchase 180 dan, resulting in the long-term backlog of the company's willow tobacco, and the loss was incalculable. Chen Xiyao, a salesman at the Native Produce Company's retail department, was the younger brother of the owner of the privately-owned Xingxiang Paper Shop, and was introduced to the company by Xiang Taichang Paper Shop as his guarantor. Chen Xiyao was responsible for managing local paper in the Native Produce Company. When subordinate companies sent local paper, he would suppress Grade A goods and accept them as Grade B, but on the other hand, he would sell these good goods to his elder brother and guarantor. These unscrupulous merchants often stole state wealth by buying good goods at low prices.

More seriously, the Basic Construction Office of the Trade Department was filled with the eyes and ears of unscrupulous merchants. Some project leaders were themselves construction contractors. Like Han Peisen, captain of the Ninth Engineering Team, and Xu Qinshan, head of the Beibei Work Zone, were "experts" in the Chongqing construction industry. In the work zone they were responsible for, more than 80% of the "cadres" were "introduced" by contractors or were old acquaintances of theirs. Han Peisen not only openly represented contractors in seducing the staff of the Basic Construction Office, but even stole state secrets such as project plans, budgets, and blueprints and gave them to contractors. According to the materials that have now been investigated clearly, the contractors who were intertwined with Han Peisen or colluded with each other in Chongqing included three construction companies, "Huafeng," "Ni Yuji," and "Hexingcheng," and "Shuguang" Construction Company in Chengdu. Li Jiewen, the manager of Huafeng Construction Company, contracted projects with Han Peisen before liberation. The manager of Shuguang Construction Company was Han Peisen's superior when he worked in the Kuomintang government. Between them, it has always been "no distinction between you and me." Under Han Peisen's conspiracy, Chongqing contractors formed a contractor group led by Li Jiewen, making it impossible for the engineering construction of the Southwest Trade Department to jump out of the circle set by Han Peisen and others. At the same time, they also formed a corruption group within the Basic Construction Office, led by Xiang Junzhi, the head of the design section. The two groups echoed each other internally and colluded with each other, engaging in planned and organized theft activities. Under their despicable and shameless conspiracies, on the one hand, they made the Basic Construction Office smoky and devoid of any revolutionary atmosphere; on the other hand, they caused incalculable losses to state property. They not only recruited fleeing landlords, feudal bullies, and hooligan soldiers as "cadres," but also put the seven or eight professional dancers used by the unscrupulous merchant Li Jiewen to seduce cadres into the engineering team, euphemistically called them "counselors" to "do workers' work." In particular, in the Ninth Engineering Team directly controlled by Han Peisen, it was almost impossible to find a person with clean hands. Han Peisen and others used this group of shameless people to control and dominate most of the trade department's engineering construction distributed in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guizhou, and other regions. The state property they encroached upon was astounding. According to a rough estimate by the director of the Basic Construction Office: last year, the capital invested in basic construction was more than 60 billion yuan, but the actual projects recovered were not worth 40 billion yuan; the total loss was no less than 20 billion yuan. The Basic Construction Office conducted a preliminary inspection of the Beibei project and found that 24 of the 25 large beams purchased by Xu Qinshan and others were unusable. Floor slabs worth 20,000 to 30,000 yuan were reported as 300,000 yuan; earthwork and stonework projects that would normally and reasonably cost just over 14 million yuan were reported as 136.5 million yuan. There were also many instances of labor and material costs that differed from market prices by a factor of ten. The same type of warehouse was sometimes reported as 500 million yuan, and sometimes as 1.6 billion yuan. However, they were not satisfied with this, and even developed into open plunder and rogue behavior. The four projects in the Chongqing area contracted by the Li Jiewen group were left unfinished and unattended, and they said arrogantly, "I have taken the money, and the project will not be done. You can deduct or fine me as you wish!" The Li Jiewen group used this rogue method to default on more than 1.5 billion yuan of state funds. In this way, they colluded from the inside out, and attacked from within and without, turning our economic construction agencies into nests of corruption and tools for exploiting the blood and sweat of the people.

In the Department Store Company, it was also discovered that Tao Mingyou, a clerk in the Transportation Section, was sent by Tao Boxuan, the business manager of Chongqing Hezhong Shipping Company. Wu Ren, a dispatcher in the Southwest Region Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company, was appointed by Wu Shandeh, the manager of Longchang Automobile Materials Shop. In both cases, the father acted as an external contact, and the son acted as an internal accomplice, engaging in shameless activities that caused huge losses to state property.

The leading organs of the Southwest Region have paid close attention to these eyes and ears and representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated state economic agencies, and have successively arrested the infiltrated "moles" Han Peisen, Xu Qinshan, Wu Ren, as well as Li Jiewen, the manager of Huafeng Construction Company, Zhuang Maobin, the deputy manager of Ni Yuji, Zhao Shuda, the manager of Hexingcheng, and Wu Shandeh, the manager of Longchang Automobile Materials Shop, who instructed them to infiltrate state-owned economic agencies.

    西南区许多经济机关和企业部门  
    发现一批奸商派进来的“坐探” 
    打入分子和指派者多人已被逮捕
    西南区各经济机关和企业部门在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，发现一批奸商派进来的“坐探”。他们窃取经济情报、侦探国家机密，从内部瓦解和勾引我们的工作人员，用里应外合的卑鄙手段，达到盗窃国家资财的无耻目的。他们把我们的经济机关变成他们贪污腐化的巢穴和剥削人民的工具。西南军政委员会贸易部所属土产公司、百货公司和基本建设处，就发现了这样一连串的事实。
    去年八月，重庆市场上的棓子（一种药材）涨价。国家贸易机关决定由土产公司大量抛售，以促使棓材价格稳定或回跌。负责这个工作的职员张治湘，把消息报告给立达山货行，并帮助立达山货行把土产公司所抛售的棓子全部买去。当时市价已经涨到每担二十七万五千元，张治湘是按每担二十六万三千元出售的。同时，他们知道国家再没有力量压低这一商品的价格时，便拚命去市场收购。及至大批商品掌握到手，便把已经高涨了的价格再提高到每担三十二万元。张治湘和立达山货行就这样利用国家压价的政策，使物价猛涨起来。人民遭受了不可计量的损失；他们获得一亿数千万元的暴利。另一件事是：当桃仁产地价格过低、销地价格太高的时候，国家贸易机关决定直接到产地收购，以提高产地桃仁价格，维护生产者的利益。但土产公司的职员邱耀庭，把这个经济情报报告了裕昌干菜行，使他们先一步到达了产地，乘国家收购人员到达以前大量收购，从而掌握了桃仁市场的主动权。及至桃仁收回，国营公司决定出售时，裕昌干菜行又在邱耀庭的指引下先一步抛出，使国营公司大批桃仁不得出手。这批桃仁使土产公司在利润和利息上损失九千五百六十万元。同年八月，土产公司收购黄花，当时市价每担三十四万元。邱耀庭却以每担四十万元的价格向裕昌等私商大量收购，等于公开地把土产公司的公款一千三百多万元送给了私商。原来张治湘和邱耀庭，都是奸商特地派来的。邱耀庭本是私营裕昌干菜行的可靠的“学徒”，是在去年三月乘土产公司招考工作人员时，由裕昌干菜行派来混进土产公司的。据邱耀庭说，他先后泄露过八种商品的机密，都严重地损害了人民和国家的利益。在土产公司，同时发现几个职员都是奸商派来的，其中有的是私商的侄子、弟弟或亲戚。如：土产公司门市部山货组熊光世，是由他的父亲（山货商）和万县私营合记烟行股东罗国祯勾结，由罗出面作保考进公司的。去年四月中旬，当土产公司快要提高土烟售价的前几天，熊光世连忙以原价卖给合记烟行土烟一百件，使公司损失八百多万元。同年八月间，刨丝烟原料市价每担七十二万元，熊光世却以每担七十一万元的价格卖三百零五担给奸商苟德明，使公司损失三百零五万元。去年土产公司存有大批柳烟不易出售；但是当国营湖北沙道观百货公司来买货时，熊光世反将采购人员介绍到他父亲所在的福群烟栈，购买了一百八十担，以致公司的柳烟长期积压不能出售，损失难以计算。土产公司门市部业务员陈希尧，是私营兴祥纸号老板的弟弟，由祥太昌纸号出面作保介绍到公司来的。陈希尧在土产公司负责经营土纸。当下级公司送来土纸时，他把甲等货压到乙等收下，但另一面却把这些好货卖给他的哥哥和保人。这些奸商就以低价买好货的办法，经常盗窃国家的财富。
    更严重的是贸易部的基本建设处，那里住满了奸商的耳目。某些工程负责人，本身就是营造商。像第九工队长韩培森、北碚工区负责人许钦山，就是重庆营造商界的“能手”。在他们负责的工区，百分之八十以上的“干部”是由包商“介绍”的，或者是他们自己的旧相识。韩培森不但公开代表包商勾引基本建设处的工作人员，而且竟把有关国家机密的工程计划、预算和蓝图偷给包商。据现在已调查清楚的材料，和韩培森扭成一气或互相勾结包商，在重庆有“华丰”“倪玉记”“合兴成”等三家营造厂，在成都有“蜀光”营造厂。华丰营造厂的经理李介文，解放前同韩培森一起承包工程。蜀光营造厂经理是韩培森在国民党政府做事时的上司。他们之间，向来是“不分你我”的。在韩培森的密谋下，重庆包商组成了以李介文为首的包商集团，使西南贸易部的工程建设无论如何跳不出韩培森等所摆好的圈子。同时，他们又在基本建设处内部，组成了以设计科长相均之为首的贪污腐化集团。两个集团内外呼应、狼狈为奸，进行有计划有组织的偷盗活动。在他们卑鄙无耻的阴谋下，一方面把基本建设处搞得乌烟瘴气、毫无革命气息；一方面使国家财产遭受了不可计量的损失。他们不仅把逃亡地主、封建把头、流氓兵痞收做“干部”，而且把奸商李介文用来勾引干部的七、八个职业舞女，也编制在工程队里，美其名曰“辅导员”，“做工人工作”。特别是韩培森直接掌握的第九工队，几乎找不到一个手上干净的人。韩培森等就利用这伙无耻之徒，掌握并统治了贸易部分布在重庆、成都、昆明、贵州等地区的工程建设的大部分。他们侵夺的国家财产十分惊人。据基本建设处处长的粗略的估计：去年投资于基本建设的资本是六百多亿元，实际收回的工程不值四百亿元；损失总数不下二百亿元。基本建设处曾把北碚工程做了初步检查，发现由许钦山等人负责收买的二十五根大梁，便有二十四根不能用。价值两三万元的楼板，他们报账三十万元；土石方工程按正常合理的价格不过一千四百多万元，他们报了一亿三千六百五十万元。报价和市价相差十倍的工料费用还有许多。一幢同样的仓房，有的报账五亿元，有的报账十六亿元。然而他们并不以这为满足，而且发展到公开的掠夺和耍无赖。由李介文集团承包的重庆地区的四处工程，没有做完就放下不管了，并且狂妄地说：“钱是我拿了，工程不做了，要扣要罚由你们吧！”李介文集团就用这种流氓手段，赖去国家现款十五亿多元。他们就这样里应外合，内外夹击地把我们的经济建设机关变成了他们贪污腐化的巢穴和剥削人民血汗的工具。
    在百货公司，还发现运输科员陶铭右，是重庆合众轮船公司业务经理陶伯宣派来的。中国工业器材公司西南区公司调拨科员吴仁，是隆昌汽车材料行经理吴善德所指派。这两案都是父亲做外线，儿子做内应进行无耻勾当，使国家财产遭受到巨大损失。
    对于这些资产阶级打入国家经济机关的耳目和代表，西南区领导机关已经予以高度注意，并先后逮捕了打入的“坐探”韩培森、许钦山、吴仁以及指示他们打入国营经济机关的华丰营造厂经理李介文、倪玉记副经理庄茂彬、合兴成经理赵叔达和隆昌汽车材料行经理吴善德等。　（本报记者林里）
