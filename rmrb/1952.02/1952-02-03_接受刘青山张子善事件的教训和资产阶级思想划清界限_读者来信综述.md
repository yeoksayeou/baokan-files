    Accepting the Lessons of the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan Incident and Drawing a Line Between Ourselves and Bourgeois Ideology – A Summary of Readers' Letters
    Since this newspaper published "The Decision of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Expelling Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party" and "The Crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in Stealing State Property" on December 30th of last year, we have received 219 letters from Party organizations at all levels, People's Governments, PLA units, committees of the New Democratic Youth League at all levels, factories, enterprises, schools, and rural and street communities. These letters unanimously support the decision of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party and to hand them over to the People's Government for punishment according to the law. These readers unanimously criticized the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP for failing to discover Liu and Zhang's mistakes for a long time, and for the failure of some members of the Tianjin District Committee of the CCP to wage an irreconcilable struggle against Liu and Zhang. They demanded that the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Tianjin District Committee accept this painful lesson and resolutely overcome their bureaucratic and liberalistic work styles.
    Many readers have further recognized the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Communist Party from the Party's handling of the Liu and Zhang incident. One hundred and one students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Henan University, Tongxian Middle School, and Xuancheng Youzhagou Central Primary School wrote: Through the handling of the huge embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, they have more deeply realized the greatness, glory, and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party. The infinite loyalty of the Chinese Communist Party to the cause of the people has made them believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the evil habits and practices such as corruption, degeneration, deception, theft, and bribery left over from the ruling class of old China can certainly be eradicated. The huge embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan has also made them realize the harm of bourgeois ideology to the revolution. The ideological influence of bourgeois corruption within the revolutionary ranks must be thoroughly eliminated; otherwise, it will hinder the construction of the new China.
    The vast majority of readers, especially Communist Party members, have examined the influence of bourgeois ideology on themselves in connection with this incident. Zhang Kun, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Ba County Committee of the CCP in Hebei Province, said: "In the past, I thought that I had a long revolutionary history and had done hard work if not merit, and that I should now enjoy a little. So I also envied the corrupt and decadent life of the bourgeoisie and gradually became 'particular' about clothing and food. The Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident sobered me up and made me realize that I was also moving towards the path of corruption." Zhang Quanyi, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Xie Baozhi, Secretary of the United Front Work Department, also examined the corrupt and pleasure-seeking ideas that had grown since entering the city. Chen Maogong of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives Cadre School, Zhong Qiu of the Personnel Department of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and others wrote that when the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, they thought they were innocent and had nothing to oppose. Only after discussing the Liu and Zhang incident did they realize that this idea was wrong and that they should quickly draw a line between themselves and bourgeois ideology.

    接受刘青山张子善事件的教训和资产阶级思想划清界限  
    ——读者来信综述
    本报去年十二月三十日发表了“中共河北省委关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议”和“刘青山、张子善盗窃国家资财的罪行”后，先后接到来自各级党组织、人民政府、解放军部队、新民主主义青年团各级委员会、工厂、企业部门、学校及农村、街道的二百一十九个读者的来信。这些来信，一致拥护中共河北省委开除刘青山、张子善的党籍和送交人民政府依法惩办的措施。这些读者一致对中共河北省委长期不能发现刘、张的错误，中共天津地委部分党员不能和刘、张作不调和的斗争，提出了严厉的批评，要求河北省委和天津地委接受这一沉痛的教训，坚决克服自己的官僚主义和自由主义作风。
    许多读者从党对刘、张事件的处理中，进一步认识了共产党的光荣、伟大、正确。北京大学、清华大学、河南大学、通县中学、宣城油榨沟中心小学的一百零一个学生来信说：通过中共河北省委对刘青山、张子善巨大贪污案的处理，他们更深刻地认识了中国共产党的伟大、光荣、正确。中国共产党对人民事业的无限忠诚，使他们相信在中国共产党领导下，一定能够根绝旧中国统治阶级所遗留的贪污、腐化、欺骗、盗窃、行贿等恶风劣习。刘青山、张子善巨大贪污案，也使他们认识了资产阶级思想对革命的危害。在革命阵营内必须彻底肃清资产阶级贪污、腐化的思想影响，否则，就会妨碍新中国的建设。
    绝大部分读者，特别是共产党员，都联系这一事件，检查了自己所受的资产阶级思想的影响。中共河北省霸县县委组织部副部长张崑说：“过去我认为自己革命历史长，没有功劳也有苦劳，现在应该享受一点。于是我也羡慕资产阶级的腐化堕落的生活，逐渐在穿、吃上‘讲究’起来。刘青山、张子善事件使我清醒起来，使我意识到自己也正向着腐化的道路上走去。”县委副书记张全义、统战部秘书谢宝智等也都检查了进城后滋长了的腐化享乐思想。中华全国合作社干部学校陈懋功、山东省人民政府人事厅仲秋等来信说：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，他们还认为自己很清白、没有什么可反的。经过对刘、张事件的讨论，才发现这种思想是错误的，应该迅速地跟资产阶级思想划清界限。
