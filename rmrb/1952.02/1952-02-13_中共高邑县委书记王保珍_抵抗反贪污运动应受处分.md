    CCP Gaoyi County Party Secretary Wang Baozhen
    Should be Punished for Resisting the Anti-Corruption Campaign

    Wang Baozhen, Secretary of the CCP Hebei Province Gaoyi County Committee and Deputy Director of the County Thrift Inspection Committee, not only failed to actively lead the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, but secretly organized a defense line to resist the movement.

    At the beginning of the campaign, Wang Baozhen consciously pulled a group of corrupt elements to work in the Thrift Inspection Committee and the Thrift Inspection Committee Office. He decided that major embezzler Zhao Shengshi (manager of the county government organ's production) and Zhao Chuan, the head of the county government's personnel section who had corruption problems, would serve as members of the Thrift Inspection Committee and directors of the office. Those who were active in the movement, such as the head of the county party committee's propaganda department, the president of the People's Court, and the head of the Public Security Bureau, were not absorbed into the committee.

    After the spirit of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign was implemented, someone reported that the county party committee was illegally running the organ's production. Upon hearing this, Wang Baozhen said to Niu Lanqin, who had consistently accepted bribes: "Who is stirring up trouble? We must find out!" He, along with An Lirong (former head of the county party committee's organization department), Niu Lanqin (secretary of the organ's branch), Gu Xiang'e (chairman of the county women's federation), Yue Binzhi (organ's accountant), and Han Si (administrator), formed a "defense line" group and often met at An Lirong's home to discuss countermeasures. When activist Zhang Zeng ate an egg at someone's house while checking the accounts of the secretariat, Wang Baozhen and others launched a massive attack on Zhang Zeng at the next day's criticism meeting.

    Why did Wang Baozhen try so hard to obstruct this movement? Because Wang Baozhen himself had many faults: Wang Baozhen once borrowed 1.98 million yuan from the organ and failed to repay it for more than a year, only repaying 1.5 million yuan after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign was launched. He invested in public-private production units such as the Commerce and Industry Association, Xinyi, Huaxin, and Jianhua, and speculated in grain when prices fluctuated, seeking exorbitant profits. According to the accusations, he took 5 million yuan from the Huaxin production unit of the county government organ alone. In addition, he embezzled public funds whenever he had the opportunity, such as falsely claiming 2.15 million yuan for burying his father and overspending travel expenses by 150,000 yuan when going out to meetings.

    We believe that such a corrupt element as Wang Baozhen is not qualified to be the commander of the "tiger hunt." We suggest that the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Party Committee immediately investigate this matter, resolve it quickly, and ensure that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in Gaoyi County is truly launched in depth.

    Editor's Note: The CCP Hebei Provincial Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee announced on February 6th that Wang Baozhen's position would be suspended, and he would remain in the Prefectural Committee organ for a period of introspection. We believe that Wang Baozhen's errors are serious, and the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee should seriously deal with them immediately.

### 中共高邑县委书记王保珍  抵抗反贪污运动应受处分

    中共高邑县委书记王保珍
    抵抗反贪污运动应受处分
    中共河北省高邑县委书记、县节约检查委员会副主任王保珍，在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，不但不积极领导运动，反而暗地组织防线，抵抗运动。
    王保珍在运动开始时，就有意识地拉了一批贪污分子，到节约检查委员会与节约检查委员会办公室工作。他决定大贪污分子赵盛世（县政府机关生产的经理），和有贪污问题的县政府人事科长赵川，担任节约检查委员会委员兼办公室主任，而在运动中表现积极的县委宣传部长、人民法院院长、公安局长等人，都没有被吸收到委员会来。
    当反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的精神贯彻下来后，有人反映县委非法经营机关生产，王保珍听了，就和一贯接受贿赂的牛兰琴说：“这是谁给咱胡吹风，一定得追追风！”他和安立荣（前任县委组织部长）、牛兰琴（机关支部书记）、谷香娥
    （县妇女联合会主席）、岳斌治（机关会计）、韩四（管理员）等组织“防线”集团，常在安立荣家里开会，研究对策。积极分子张增在查秘书处账目时，吃了人家一个鸡蛋，王保珍等就在第二天的检举会上向张增大肆进攻。
    为什么王保珍要百般地阻碍这个运动呢？因为王保珍自己的错误很多：王保珍曾经向机关借了一百九十八万元，一年多未还，直到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，才还了一百五十万元；他在商联会、信义、华新、建华等公私营生产机关都入了股，乘粮价波动时，大肆贩卖粮食，从中谋取暴利。根据检举材料，他只在县政府生产机关华新就前后取款五百万元。此外，他一有机会就贪污公款，如藉口回家埋葬父亲，骗取二百一十五万元；出外开会超支路费十五万元等。
    我们认为像王保珍这样的贪污分子，是不配当打
    “打虎”的指挥官的。我们建议河北省委、石家庄地委立即调查这件事，迅速解决，使高邑县的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，真正深入开展起来。

    编者按：中共河北省石家庄地委已于二月六日宣布停止王保珍的职务，留在地委机关限期反省。我们认为王保珍的错误是严重的，河北省委和石家庄地委应即认真加以处理。
