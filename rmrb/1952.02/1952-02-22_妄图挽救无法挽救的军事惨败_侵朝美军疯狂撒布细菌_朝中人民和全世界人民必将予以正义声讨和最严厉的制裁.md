    Attempting to Salvage an Irretrievable Military Defeat
    American Aggressors in Korea Frenziedly Spread Bacteria
    The Korean and Chinese People and the People of the World Will Surely Impose Righteous Condemnation and the Most Severe Sanctions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 21st] Our frontline reporter reports: The inhuman American aggressor troops are violating human justice and international law on the Korean front and in the rear, carrying out a bacteriological war aimed at the large-scale slaughter of peaceful Korean residents and the Korean and Chinese People's troops. From January 28th to February 17th of this year, American aggressor military aircraft continuously released various germ-spreading insects in large quantities over the front-line positions of our army and in the rear in Korea. As follows:
    On January 28th, enemy aircraft released three types of small insects never seen before by Korean residents over the areas of Jinguli, Waiyuandi, Longzhudong, and Longshuidong, southeast of Yichuan: the first type resembled black flies; the second type resembled fleas; and the third type resembled ticks (also like small spiders).
    On January 29th, enemy aircraft released a batch of flies and fleas over Yichuan.
    On February 11th, enemy aircraft dropped large quantities of paper packages and paper tubes containing small insects such as fleas, spiders, whiteflies, ants, and flies over our army positions in the Tieyuan area.
    On February 11th, enemy aircraft released a large number of flies over the area near Shibianli; at the same time, a large number of fleas were released over the area near Shuoning; fleas, flies, mosquitoes, crickets and other small insects were released over the area near Pingkang.
    On February 13th, enemy aircraft released small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and fleas over our army positions in the Jinhua area.
    On February 15th, enemy aircraft released small insects such as flies, spiders, and fleas over the area near Pingkang.
    On February 16th, enemy aircraft released spiders and lice over the Hongshu and Wuchuanli areas east of the North Han River.
    On February 17th, four enemy aircraft released large numbers of small insects such as fleas and flies over the areas of Shangjiali and Xiajiali north of Pingkang.
    According to preliminary tests by our military medical department, these small insects released by enemy aircraft contain plague, cholera and other germs.
    From reports in the enemy's own publications, we can see that the American military has long been preparing and manufacturing bacteriological weapons. According to a report in the American magazine "Life" (October 8, 1951), the bacteriological warfare department of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps stationed at Fort Detrick, Maryland, has already begun to study bacteriological weapons. "Life" magazine also shamelessly boasted that this bacteriological warfare department has invented sixteen kinds of bacteriological weapons that can be spread through air and water to kill large numbers of people. American aggressors are also carrying out the same sinister preparations in Korea. As early as March 1951, Brigadier General Simes, director of the Health and Welfare Department of the headquarters of General Ridgway, commander-in-chief of the American aggressor forces in Korea, led the American aggressor army's No. 1091 bacteriological landing craft to Wonsan Port to test bacteriological weapons on captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. According to a report by an Associated Press reporter from Geoje Island, Korea, on May 18, 1951, this landing craft quickly sailed from Wonsan Port to Geoje Island to conduct bacteriological experiments on captured personnel of the Korean People's Army. The reporter said: "The ship's laboratory obtains cultures of oral and gastrointestinal germs from prisoner-of-war camps stretched out on Geoje Island and conducts three thousand tests every day." As a result of these experiments, "of the 125,000 North Korean prisoners confined in half a dozen corrals on the island, 1,400 are very ill, and about 80 percent of the rest are infected with some kind of disease." Other American publications have also reported on the situation of this landing craft, which is engaged in inhuman activities.
    The enemy's inhuman, bloodthirsty atrocities were not only prepared over a long period of time, but were also carried out in collusion with Ishii Shiro, former lieutenant general of the Japanese Army Medical Corps, veterinary major general Wakamatsu Jiro, and Kitano Masazo, the major war criminals who carried out bacteriological warfare during the period when Japanese imperialism occupied China and were deadly enemies of the Korean and Chinese peoples. According to a December 5, 1951, Rangoon dispatch from the Dentsu news agency, citing two unnamed American officials, these three Japanese "bacteriological experts," under the orders of Ridgway's headquarters, left Tokyo for Korea with all the necessary equipment for bacteriological warfare to use captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese People's forces as subjects for bacteriological experiments, and will submit a report on plans for conducting bacteriological warfare in winter. And these three "bacteriological experts" are precisely the three major war criminals among the five major bacteriological war criminals whom the Soviet government proposed to establish an international special military tribunal to try in its note of February 1, 1950.
    The above heinous and monstrous crimes prove that the enemy is attempting to use acts that violate human justice and international law to salvage its already unsalvageable military defeat on the Korean battlefield, and proves that the enemy's purpose in delaying the Korean armistice talks is to prepare for a more cruel war. An enemy that is so crazy and brutal will surely be subjected to the righteous condemnation and most severe sanctions of the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world.

    妄图挽救无法挽救的军事惨败
    侵朝美军疯狂撒布细菌
    朝中人民和全世界人民必将予以正义声讨和最严厉的制裁
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社前线记者报道：灭绝人性的美国侵略军正在朝鲜前线和后方违反人类正义和国际公法，进行以大规模屠杀朝鲜和平居民和朝中人民部队为目的的细菌战争。自本年一月二十八日至二月十七日为止，美国侵略军的军用飞机连续在朝鲜我军前线阵地和后方的上空，大量撒放传布细菌的各种毒虫。计：
    一月二十八日，敌机在伊川东南之金谷里、外远地、龙沼洞、龙水洞一带上空撒放为朝鲜居民所从未见过的三类小虫：第一类状如黑蝇；第二类状如跳蚤；第三类状如壁虱（又像小蜘蛛）。
    一月二十九日，敌机在伊川上空撒下一批苍蝇及跳蚤。
    二月十一日，敌机又在铁原一带的我军阵地上空投下大批纸包、纸筒，内装跳蚤、蜘蛛、白蛉子、蚂蚁、蝇子等类小虫。
    二月十一日，敌机在市边里附近地区上空撒下大批苍蝇；同时又在朔宁一带地区上空撒下大批跳蚤；在平康一带地区上空撒下跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊虫、蟋蟀等类小虫。
    二月十三日，敌机又在金化地区我军阵地上空撒下苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛、跳蚤等类小虫。
    二月十五日，敌机在平康一带地区撒下苍蝇、蜘蛛、跳蚤等类小虫。
    二月十六日，敌机在北汉江以东红树及乌川里地区上空撒下蜘蛛、虱子等。
    二月十七日，敌机四架在平康以北之上甲里、下甲里地区上空，撒下大批跳蚤、苍蝇等类小虫。
    根据我方军医部门初步化验结果，敌机撒下的这些小虫含有鼠疫、霍乱及其他病菌。
    从敌人自己的报刊的报道里，我们看到美国军方早已在准备和制造细菌武器。据美国“生活”杂志（一九五一年十月八日）报道，美国陆军化学兵团驻在马利兰州德第里克兵营的细菌作战部早已开始研究细菌武器。“生活”杂志并且无耻地夸耀说，这个细菌作战部已经发明了利用空气和水来散播的足以大批杀害人命的十六种细菌武器。美国侵略者在朝鲜也进行同样的罪恶的准备活动。早在一九五一年三月，美国侵略军总司令李奇微将军总部的卫生福利处处长赛姆斯准将曾率领侵朝美军第一○九一号细菌登陆艇到元山港，以中国人民志愿军被俘人员来试验细菌武器。据美联社记者一九五一年五月十八日从朝鲜巨济岛的报道，这只登陆艇很快即自元山港开到巨济岛，以朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行细菌试验。这个记者说：“船上的实验室从伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营取得口与肠胃的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验。”这样试验的结果，就使“岛上半打圈栏里面关着的十二万五千多北朝鲜俘虏中，有一千四百人病得很厉害，其余的人约有百分之八十染有某种疾病。”美国其他的报刊亦曾报道有关这只干着惨无人道的勾当的登陆艇的情形。
    敌人的灭绝人性的嗜血者的暴行，不但是经过长期准备，而且是在与朝中人民的死敌日本帝国主义占领中国时期进行细菌战的大战犯、前日本陆军军医中将石井四郎、兽医少将若松次郎和北野政藏等人的勾结下进行的。据电通社一九五一年十二月五日仰光电引述拒绝透露姓名的两名美国官员所透露的消息称，这三个日本“细菌专家”，奉李奇微总部之命，携带了进行细菌战的一切必要装备，离开东京到达了朝鲜，准备以朝中人民部队的被俘人员作为细菌实验的对象，并且将提出关于在冬天进行细菌战的计划的报告。而这三个“细菌专家”就正是一九五○年二月一日苏联政府的照会中提议设立国际特别军事法庭加以审判的五个大细菌战犯中间的三个大战犯。
    以上这些令人发指的滔天罪行，证明敌人企图以违反人类正义和国际公法的行为来挽救它在朝鲜战场上的已经无法挽救的军事惨败，证明敌人拖延朝鲜停战谈判的目的就是为了准备进行更残酷的战争。疯狂、残暴到如此程度的敌人，必将受到朝中人民和全世界人民的正义的声讨和最严厉的制裁。
