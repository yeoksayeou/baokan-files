    At Tianshui Station on the Northwest Railway
    Liang Xing

    The 1,200-kilometer-long Longhai Railway, starting from Lianyungang on the coast of the East China Sea, stretches across the waist of our motherland like a beautiful belt, all the way to Tianshui in Gansu Province.

    Tianshui is an important connecting point on the Northwest Railway. The future Tiancheng Railway will extend from here to Chengdu in Sichuan Province, meeting the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway there. The Tianlan Railway also starts from Tianshui, and Northwest Railway employees are striving to open it to traffic to Lanzhou by the end of 1952.

    I stood at the Beidaobu Station in Tianshui, gazing in all directions.

    "When we were first liberated in 1949, this was just a wilderness," a comrade at the station told me. But now I saw rows of new buildings, warehouses, and railway factories. A new street has formed south of the station, and many hotels and inns have opened. Three traffic sentry posts have been set up on the Wei River Bridge, directing countless trucks and rubber-wheeled carts coming and going.

    This is the growing Tianshui Beidaobu Station.

    Rows of freight cars were parked in the station, with people busily going up and down. The day's mixed passenger-freight train was about to depart eastward. Several dozen livestock were being transported eastward in four train cars; the horses were neighing in the cars. A railway policeman was standing under the cars, looking up and loudly telling the owners to take good care of the animals and not to let them get frightened when the train whistled. He also told them that there would be time to "water" the animals at the next station. The owners nodded gratefully, listening to his instructions. Many of these owners were farmers from Henan and Shaanxi provinces. I met one of them, a liberated farmer from Lingbao County, Henan Province, named Xu Suizhong. He told me that sixteen of them had borrowed money from the government to come to Gansu to buy mules, horses, and donkeys. When asked about their past, he said, "We have completed land reform over there. In the past? I was a poor peasant with only two mu of land. Now my family has been allocated fourteen mu!"

    The station was piled high with goods to be transported eastward. Walking past those packages was like walking into a Chinese medicine shop, with a strong smell of medicine. These were local medicinal materials from the Northwest, including rhubarb, angelica, licorice, and so on. Looking at the labels on the packages, their destinations were: Xi'an, Hankou, and Shanghai.

    The most striking thing at the station was the workers rolling barrels of oil forward with a rumbling sound. They were loading rows of oil barrels onto the train for transport eastward. Petroleum, this kind of motive fuel, is so precious to us that people compare it to blood in the body. With petroleum, our cars and tractors can run; with petroleum, our tanks and armored vehicles can move; with petroleum, our planes can soar into the sky. Geologists, after diagnosing the ground and underground in the Northwest oil region, exclaimed in amazement: the word "oil field" is not enough; it is simply an oil sea - an ocean of oil. But in the past, due to the inconvenience of transportation in the Northwest, it was not possible to extract the underground oil on a large scale from dozens or hundreds of wells. Even the oil that had been extracted could not be easily transported to all directions due to transportation difficulties. Now, although the eastern section of the Northwest Railway, the Baotian Railway, has just been opened to traffic, some petroleum products have begun to flow through this railway artery to the heart of the motherland. Although Tianshui is not very close to the oil-producing area, it is indeed a new chapter in the history of oil transportation in the Northwest that some petroleum can be loaded onto trains in Gansu Province for transport eastward.

    The Northwest Railway is being built intensively towards the northwest, so the transportation task of the Baotian Railway is mainly to transport railway construction materials to the northwest, and to use the empty cars on the return trip to bring out local products from the northwest. Train after train of materials arrived, steel rails from all over were arriving! Cement from North China was arriving! Timber from the Xing'an Mountains in the Northeast was also flowing into Gansu Province like a yellow river; they will be laid on the Northwest Plateau, allowing trains to travel further.

    The stations here do not yet have electric lights. When night falls, kerosene lamps are lit in the railway telecommunications office. It is under this dim lamplight that they are holding modern telephone conferences with comrades hundreds of miles away on the Tianlan Railway construction line. This incongruous scene perfectly illustrates the beginning of the vigorous development of construction. We happened to see here an oil painting by the Soviet artist Nalbandyan, depicting Lenin and Stalin discussing the electrification of Russia in 1920. At that time, there were no electric lights on the streets of Moscow, and we could clearly see that there was a tallow candle on Lenin's desk. But from the beginning of Soviet electrification construction at that time, today every Soviet citizen has 500 horsepower of electricity. This oil painting shines under the lamplight of this station in Gansu Province.

    A worker told me at this time: "The railway line from Tianshui to Chengdu has been surveyed and the line has been determined. We may soon start erecting power lines from here to there."

    These short words touched my heart. I heard the cheerful roar of the train outside the window, and I felt that our motherland was advancing bravely like a train.

### 在西北铁路天水车站上

    在西北铁路天水车站上
    梁星
    一千二百多公里长的陇海铁路，从东海边的连云港起，像条美丽的带子一样横过我们祖国的腰部，直到甘肃省的天水。
    天水是西北铁路的重要联结点。未来的天成铁路就要从这里通到四川省的成都，和那边的成渝铁路碰头。而天兰铁路又是从天水作起点，西北铁路员工正在争取要在一九五二年底通车到兰州。
    我站在天水北道埠车站向四面遥望。
    “在一九四九年刚解放的时候，这里还是一片荒草。”车站上的一位同志这样告诉我。但是现在我看到了一排一排的新建筑物，看到了仓库和铁路工厂。车站南边新的街道已经形成了，许多旅馆和客栈开张了。渭河桥上安排了三个交通岗哨，指挥着无数南来北往的载重汽车和胶皮轮大车。
    这就是正在成长着的天水北道埠车站。
    车站里一列列的货车排在那里，人们紧张地上上下下。当天的一次客货混合列车马上就要往东边开行了。有四个车皮上装着几十头牲口也正要往东边运，马在车上咴咴的叫着。一个铁路警察正站在车下仰着脸大声地对这些牲口的主人讲话，告诉他们小心照料这些牲口，火车一叫不要让牲口惊了。他还告诉他们到前边那一个站上可以有时间“饮”牲口。牲口的主人感激地点着头，听着他的指点。这些主人有很多都是从河南、陕西省来的农民。我认识了当中的一个，他是河南省灵宝县翻身的农民，叫许随众。他告诉我：他们十六个人从政府贷到了款，跑到甘肃来买骡子、马和毛驴。问起他们过去的光景，他说：“我们那边完成了土地改革。过去吗？过去我是个贫农，才二亩地。现在我家分到十四亩地啦！”
    在车站上堆满了准备要往东边运的货物。从那些货包旁边走过，像走进了中国药铺一样，可以闻到浓烈的药味。这是西北的土产药材，有大黄、当归、甘草等等。看那货包上标出的它们要去的地方，是：西安、汉口，还有上海。
    在车站上最引人注意的是工友们正在滚动石油桶隆隆前进。他们正在把那排列成行的石油桶装车往东运。石油，这种动力燃料，对我们说来太宝贵了，人们把它比做身体里的血。有了石油，我们的汽车和拖拉机可以转动；有了石油，我们的坦克车和装甲车可以开行；有了石油，我们的飞机可以冲上天空。地质学家在西北石油区的地上地下诊断了以后，惊叹地说：油田这个字眼儿都不够用了，这简直可以说是油海——石油的海洋。但是过去由于西北交通的不便利，还不能够使地下的石油大规模地从几十个几百个井口冒出来。已经冒出来的石油，也因为交通困难，不容易运到四面八方去。现在，西北的大动脉——西北铁路的东段宝天路虽然刚刚通车，一部分石油产品就开始通过铁路这条脉管流向祖国的心脏了。虽然天水距离石油的产区还不算近，但是一部分石油在甘肃省就可以上火车往东运，这确是西北石油运输史上的新的一页。
    西北铁路正在紧张地向西北铺修，因此宝天铁路的运输任务主要地还是运送铁路修建材料到西北来，利用回去的空车才把西北的土特产带出去。运料的车一列跟着一列开来了，从各路运来的钢轨到了！华北的洋灰到了！东北兴安岭上的木料也像黄色的河流一样流进甘肃省了，它们就要铺在西北的高原上，让火车向更远的地方开过去。
    这里的车站都还没有电灯。当夜晚到来的时候，在铁路电务段办公室里点着煤油灯。就在这样微弱的油灯光下面，他们正在和天兰铁路工程线上几百里以外的同志们举行着近代化的电话会议。这个不调和的场面，正好说明了建设事业的蓬勃发展的开端。我们恰好在这里看到了苏联画家纳尔班甸画的一幅油画，画的是列宁和斯大林在一九二零年讨论俄国电气化的场面。当时莫斯科街上没有电灯光，在列宁的办公桌上我们也看得清清楚楚地那里摆着的是洋腊。但是从这时候开始的苏联电气化建设，到今天给了每个苏联公民五百匹马力的电力。这幅油画在甘肃省的这个车站的油灯光下，闪着光辉。
    一位工友这时候告诉我：“从天水到成都的铁路线已经测量定线了。我们不久就很可能从这里开始往那边架电线啦。”
    这短短的几句话打动了我的心。我听到窗外火车的愉快的吼叫，感到我们的祖国正像火车一样在勇猛前进。
