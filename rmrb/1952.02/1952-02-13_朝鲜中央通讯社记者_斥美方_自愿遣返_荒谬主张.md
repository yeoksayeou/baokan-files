Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 11th: A special correspondent from the Korean Central News Agency reports from Kaesong: The obstacle to reaching an agreement on the fourth item on the Korean armistice negotiation agenda is the US's absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation." In order to detain our captured personnel, the US has insisted on not allowing representatives from the Red Cross societies of North Korea and China to participate in visits to prisoner-of-war camps. The US says that only representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross can visit prisoner-of-war camps on both sides.

The reporter pointed out: The US insists on this opinion because it fears that representatives from the Red Cross societies of North Korea and China will expose and shatter their sinister schemes. This scheme is an attempt to detain our captured personnel under the guise of the so-called "neutral organization," the International Committee of the Red Cross. Our proposal for a joint inspection team composed of representatives from the Red Cross societies of North Korea and China and representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross to inspect prisoner-of-war camps on both sides is the only proposal that would help the repatriation work.

The reporter continued: The US's conspiracy to detain our captured personnel is also manifested in the discussion of the issue of the repatriation deadline. We proposed that the repatriation work be completed in two months, but the US wants ninety days. Have the US representatives forgotten what they themselves said recently? At the meetings on January 15th and January 31st, the US successively stated that it could complete the repatriation of the prisoners of war it held within two months. But today, the US says it will take ninety days to return the prisoners. Our proposal that both sides repatriate all prisoners of war within two months after the armistice agreement takes effect is based on specific conditions such as transportation conditions and the number of prisoners of war, and is completely feasible. Therefore, the US's claim of ninety days can only be interpreted as being for the purpose of detaining our captured personnel.

The reporter also stated: The US has tattooed "anti-communist" slogans on the hands of our captured personnel, which also exposes the essence of the US's so-called "voluntary repatriation." All kind people in the world know that the US's "voluntary repatriation" is a synonym for the unprecedented and shameless act of detaining our captured personnel.

The reporter emphasized: If the US still does not abandon this shameless claim, then the fourth item on the agenda cannot be agreed upon.

### 朝鲜中央通讯社记者  斥美方“自愿遣返”荒谬主张

    斥美方“自愿遣返”荒谬主张
    【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜中央通讯社特派记者自开城报道称：阻碍朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程达成协议的，就是美方的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。美方为了扣留我方被俘人员，曾坚持不让朝中两国的红十字会代表参加访问战俘营。美方说只有红十字国际委员会的代表才能访问双方的战俘营。
    记者指出：美方坚持这样的意见，是因为怕朝中两国的红十字会代表暴露和粉碎了它们的凶恶诡计。这个诡计就是企图借所谓“中立机构”红十字国际委员会的招牌，来扣留我方被俘人员。我方建议由朝中两国的红十字会代表和红十字国际委员会代表组成联合访问团视察双方战俘营的提案，才是唯一有助于遣俘工作的提案。
    该记者继称：美方扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，也表现在有关遣俘期限问题的讨论中。我方建议两个月结束遣俘工作，美方却要九十天。美方代表难道竟忘记了他们自己最近所说的话吗？美方在一月十五日和一月三十一日的会议上，曾先后表示可以在两个月内将其所收容的战俘遣送完毕。但今天美方却说要九十天时间才能送回俘虏。主张双方在停战协定生效后两个月内遣返全体战俘的我方提案，是按运输条件、战俘数字等具体情况提出的，是完全可能实行的。因而美方九十天的说法只能解释它是为了扣留我方被俘人员。
    该记者又称：美方曾在我方被俘人员的手上刺了“反共”口号，这同样也暴露了美方所谓“自愿遣返”的本质。全世界善良人民都知道美方的“自愿遣返”就是史无前例地扣留我方被俘人员的无耻行为的代名词。
    该记者强调指出：美方如果仍不放弃这种无耻主张，那么第四项议程是无法达成协议的。
