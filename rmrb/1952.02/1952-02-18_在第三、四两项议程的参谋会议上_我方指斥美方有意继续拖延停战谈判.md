Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 17th: At the plenary meeting of the delegations from both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 17th, the other side presented its opinions on our side's revised draft principles regarding the fifth agenda item. In order to carefully study the other side's opinions, our side suggested adjourning the meeting until 10:00 AM on the 18th.

    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, our side sternly pointed out that according to the other side's own definition of neutral nations, neutral nations are those that have not had combat troops participate in hostile actions in Korea, and the neutral nations proposed by our side all truly meet this definition. The other side cannot provide any reason, nor is there any reason, to oppose any of the three neutral nations proposed by our side. The other side's unreasonable opposition can only be interpreted as intentionally delaying the reaching of an armistice negotiation agreement. Our side has already proposed a completely reasonable solution on the third agenda item. Whether an agreement on the third agenda item can be reached quickly depends entirely on the other side.

    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, both sides continued to exchange opinions on our side's revised draft of February 14th. Our staff pointed out that our side's revised draft of February 14th is a completely reasonable and sufficient plan in which our side has made every effort to resolve the fourth agenda item. After this draft is put forward, there should no longer be any divergent opinions between the two sides. If resolving the fourth agenda item still requires more time, resulting in a delay in reaching an armistice agreement, this will be entirely the responsibility of the other side. Our staff also sincerely expressed the hope that the other side would reconsider and abandon its persistent claims, so that an armistice agreement could be reached at an early date.

    在第三、四两项议程的参谋会议上
    我方指斥美方有意继续拖延停战谈判
    【新华社开城十七日电】十七日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，对方提出了对于我方关于第五项议程的修正原则草案的意见。我方为仔细研究对方的意见，建议休会到十八日上午十时。
    第三项议程的参谋会议上，我方严词指出：根据对方自己所提出的中立国的定义，中立国是未曾有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家，我方所提出的中立国家，全部是真正地符合这一定义的。对方提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由，反对我方所提出的三个中立国家中的任何一个国家。对方的无理反对，只能被解释为有意拖延停战谈判协议的达成。我方在第三项议程上已经提出了完全合理的解决方案，第三项议程是否能够迅速达成协议，完全在于对方。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方继续就我方二月十四日的修正草案交换意见。我方参谋人员指出：我方二月十四日的修正草案，是我方尽了一切最大的努力，以解决第四项议程的完全合理而充分的方案。这一草案提出后，双方不应该还有任何分歧的意见。如果第四项议程的解决还需要更多的时间，以致停战协议的达成为之延迟，这将完全是对方的责任。我方参谋人员并诚恳地表示希望对方重新考虑并放弃其所坚持的主张，使停战协议得以早日达成。
