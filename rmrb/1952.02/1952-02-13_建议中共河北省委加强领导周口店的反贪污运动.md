    Suggest the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Strengthen Leadership of the Anti-Corruption Campaign in Zhoukoudian
    To the Editor: In Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, there are 18 state-owned lime kilns and more than 30 privately owned ones. Crooked merchants Zhang Mingyuan, Li Huanzhou, and others colluded with 23 private merchants to form a production joint venture. At least half of the white lime sold to the state by the joint venture was adulterated. For example, the white lime they sold to one unit was mixed with waste ash from thirty years ago, and they deliberately burned the lime half-baked to increase its weight. These crooked merchants' tax evasion is very serious; Hongshun alone has confessed to evading more than 200 million yuan in taxes. The crooked merchants also tried to obtain state-owned lime kiln railcars and military railcars through illicit means, with more than 100 cars already verified. Furthermore, the crooked merchants brazenly bribed cadres. Huang Zuocai, the director of the local tax office, accepted over 10 million yuan in bribes; some railway employees accepted over 20 million yuan in bribes; after accepting bribes, Police Chief Ma of the local police station impersonated the state-owned lime kiln to request railcars, which he then transferred to the crooked merchants to load lime. The crooked merchants of the production joint venture even used free hospitality to win over the cadres from various units who came to Zhoukoudian to buy lime.
    Based on the above situation, we requested the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tong County Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to send more cadres to Zhoukoudian to lead the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. However, the Hebei Provincial Committee only sent a reporter to gather information, and the Tong County Local Committee only sent one organization department director and one secretary to understand the situation. After two crooked merchants were arrested, the organization department director returned. Currently, only the county propaganda department director and the Tong County tax bureau director are leading this work. Although they are working hard, the campaign cannot be carried out vigorously due to the prevalence of evil influences. For example, the major corruption criminal Zhang Zhiming escaped when he heard that he was going to be arrested; the issue of dealing with the bribed cadres has also not been resolved. We hope that the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tong County Local Committee will quickly organize a leadership core, boldly mobilize the masses, and thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous elements in Zhoukoudian.

### 建议中共河北省委加强领导周口店的反贪污运动

    建议中共河北省委加强领导周口店的反贪污运动
    编辑同志：北京附近周口店有公营灰窑十八家，私营灰窑三十多家。奸商张明远、李环洲等连络二十三家私商，组成生产联营社。联营社卖给国家的白灰，至少有一半掺假。比如他们卖给某单位的白灰，掺了前三十多年的废灰，并故意把灰烧成半生半熟，以增加重量。这些奸商们偷税、漏税的情况很严重，只鸿顺一家已坦白出漏税二亿多元。奸商还设法套购公营灰窑的车皮及军用的车皮，已调查属实的达一百多辆。奸商更肆无忌惮地贿赂干部。当地税务所所长黄佐才受贿一千多万元；铁路方面有些职工受贿二千多万元；派出所马所长受贿后，曾假冒公营灰窑名义要车皮，转给奸商装灰。生产联营社的奸商更用免费招待的手段，拉拢到周口店买灰的机关干部。
    根据上述情况，我们曾要求中共河北省委员会、中共通县地方委员会加派干部到周口店，领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。但河北省委只派过一个记者去采访消息，通县地委只派组织部长一人、秘书一人去了解情况。等到逮捕了两名奸商后，组织部长就回去了。目前，当地只有县委宣传部长、通县税务局长两人领导这一工作，虽很努力，终因邪气太盛，运动不能雷厉风行地展开。如大贪污犯张志明听到要逮捕他，就逃跑了；受贿干部的处理问题也未解决。我们希望中共河北省委，中共通县地委迅速组织领导核心，放手发动群众，把周口店一切污毒彻底肃清。
