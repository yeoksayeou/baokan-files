    Seriously Examine the Erroneous Idea of Blindly Promoting Sparse Planting of Cotton

    The examples of cotton yield reduction in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province due to the blind promotion of sparse planting should attract the attention of leading organs in other cotton-planting areas.

    Why has the erroneous idea of blindly promoting sparse planting of cotton arisen? There are roughly the following reasons: First, when some areas originally planting Chinese cotton switched to planting foreign cotton, the planting technical guidance personnel at that time, in order to reverse the farmers' habit of planting Chinese cotton with narrow ridges and dense planting, emphasized sparse planting. Later, some farmers and technicians, when planting foreign cotton, only saw the benefits of sparse planting with larger plants, and did not realize that in order to increase the yield of cotton per mu, in addition to requiring each plant to produce more cotton bolls, the number of plants per mu should also be increased in order to increase the total yield per mu. Second, in some new cotton-planting areas, because the land was fertile and the foreign cotton grew vigorously, and the local farmers had no habit or experience of pruning, they naturally accepted the method of sparse planting. Third, some people seized on the concept of "sparse planting for fertile land, dense planting for lean land," and thought that dense planting in fertile land would cause the cotton seedlings to grow "wild" and not produce bolls. They did not realize that fertile land has sufficient nutrients to supply the nutritional needs of more cotton plants; if densely planted, coupled with appropriate pruning, careful cultivation and other cotton planting techniques, it can avoid growing "wild" and strive for a bumper harvest.

    The idea of sparse planting is not only held by cadres and farmers in individual places at present, but also exists to varying degrees in a large part of agricultural leading organs and experimental research organs. Now, in order to completely solve the different technical ideas about sparse and dense planting of cotton, the agricultural leading organs in each cotton-planting area should conduct a serious inspection and comparison of the local cotton planting density, and conscientiously study the dense planting and high-yield experience of Qu Yaoli and others, and launch a discussion on this issue to completely achieve unity in thinking.

    认真检查盲目地推广棉花稀植的错误思想
    河北省产棉区因为盲目地推广稀植而使棉花减产的事例，应引起其他各地植棉区领导机关的注意。
    为什么会产生盲目地推广棉花稀植的错误思想呢？大致有下列几个原因：一是原来部分种中国棉的地区在改种外国棉时，当时的植棉技术指导人员为扭转农民种中国棉的窄垅密植的习惯，曾经强调过稀植。后来某些农民和技术人员在种外国棉时，只看到稀植株大的好处，没有认识到要提高每亩棉花的产量，除要求每株多结几个棉铃外，还应增加每亩的株数以求增多每亩的总产量。二是部分新植棉地区因为地肥，外国棉发棵壮大，当地农民又没有整枝习惯和经验，他们就很自然地接受了稀植的办法。三是有些人抓住“肥地应稀、瘦地应密”的概念，以为肥地密植会使棉苗长“疯”不结桃。他们没有认识到肥地养分充足，可以供应较多棉株的营养需要；如果密植，再配合适当整枝，精耕细作等植棉技术，就可以避免长“疯”，争取丰产。
    稀植的思想，在目前来说，并不只是个别地方的干部和农民有，而且在很大一部分农业领导机关中和试验研究机关中都或多或少地存在着。现在为彻底解决关于棉花稀植密植的不同技术思想问题，各植棉地区的农业领导机关，应对当地植棉的密度进行一次认真检查比较，并认真学习曲耀离等人的密植丰产经验，对这一问题展开讨论，在思想上完全求得统一。
