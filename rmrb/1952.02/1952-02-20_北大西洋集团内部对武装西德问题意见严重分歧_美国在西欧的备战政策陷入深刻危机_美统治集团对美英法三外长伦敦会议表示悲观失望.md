Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: As the North Atlantic aggressive group's council is about to convene in Lisbon on the 20th, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France are scheduled to meet in London from the 17th to the 19th. The United States is making every effort to resolve the serious contradictions between the United States and Western European countries on the issue of arming West Germany at this foreign ministers' meeting, in order to prevent its Western European preparedness plan centered on the rearmament of West Germany from suffering another setback at the Lisbon meeting. However, even the United States itself has no confidence in whether this foreign ministers' meeting can produce results.

The fact facing the foreign ministers' meeting is that the United States' preparedness policy in Western Europe has fallen into an increasingly deep crisis. The United States' attempt to force Western European countries to accept its Western European preparedness plan centered on the rearmament of West Germany has successively failed at the Ottawa and Rome meetings of the North Atlantic Group Council. Afterwards, although the United States repeatedly anxiously ordered Western European countries to reach an agreement on the European Army plan to cover the reconstruction of the West German army before the Lisbon meeting, and the United States, Britain, and France had to complete negotiations with the West German puppet government on the conclusion of the so-called "peace agreement" (i.e., the so-called US, British, French, and German "common treaty"), so that the Lisbon meeting could reach an agreement on the entire US plan. However, more than two months after the end of the Rome meeting, the United States still failed to complete these steps. As the economic and political crises in Western European countries continue to develop, the contradictions within the North Atlantic Group on the issue of arming West Germany and expanding armaments and preparing for war have become more acute. Western European countries have been arguing endlessly about the European Army plan and have failed to reach an agreement on any key issues. The European Army negotiations are currently in a state of suspended animation. At the same time, the so-called "peace agreement" negotiations held by the United States, Britain, and France with the West German puppet government have also encountered great difficulties. Associated Press, Bonn, February 11th: "Since the negotiations began last September, little progress has been made." "Senior officials of the three Western countries drafted a 'bleak and full of disappointment' report on the 11th, saying that none of their negotiations with the West German side on the 'peace agreement' were progressing smoothly."

Now, on the eve of the Lisbon meeting, not only have the original disputes between the North Atlantic Group on these two issues not been resolved, but also new difficulties continue to arise. At the end of January, fierce disputes erupted between the West German and French ruling groups over the Saar issue; on February 8th, the West German reactionaries manipulated the Bonn parliament to put forward arrogant "conditions" for joining the European Army; on February 11th, great divisions occurred within the French reactionaries during the French National Assembly's debate on the European Army issue—all of these series of events have added one thorny problem after another to the United States' European Army and "peace agreement" plans. In this situation, the United States is extremely anxious and uneasy seeing that the Lisbon meeting will inevitably fail to pass its plan. What makes the US ruling group even more afraid is that such repeated setbacks to the US plan will have very serious consequences. Agence France-Presse revealed Washington's estimate that "if the Lisbon meeting cannot produce concrete results on the European Army issue, and if no solutions or suggestions for solutions can be obtained for the most thorny issues at hand (the Saar issue and the issue of Bonn's relationship with the Atlantic Pact), then the entire US foreign policy will encounter serious dangers."

In this deeply fearful mood, the United States is making every effort to eliminate the numerous difficulties encountered on the issue of arming West Germany at the London Foreign Ministers' Meeting, in order to somewhat change this coming doom. However, even US Secretary of State Acheson himself lacks confidence in whether the Foreign Ministers' Meeting can achieve results. He said at a press conference in Washington on the 6th that the three foreign ministers have not yet been able to decide whether their talks can reach the stage of a certain agreement. And the views of the West German occupation authorities are even more pessimistic. According to United Press, Bonn, February 12th: "Allied officials said that a final decision on the rearmament of Germany is unlikely to be reached before midsummer this year. Senior British figures pointed out that the upcoming NATO meeting in Lisbon will not be able to make any progress in this regard."

    北大西洋集团内部对武装西德问题意见严重分歧
    美国在西欧的备战政策陷入深刻危机
    美统治集团对美英法三外长伦敦会议表示悲观失望
    【新华社十六日讯】在北大西洋侵略集团理事会行将于二十日在里斯本开会以前，美、英、法三国外长已定于十七日至十九日在伦敦举行会议。美国正竭力企图在这次外长会议上解决美国与西欧国家间在武装西德问题上的严重矛盾，以防止它以西德重新武装为中心的西欧备战计划在里斯本会议上再遭挫折。但是，连美国自己对于这次外长会议能否有结果，也毫无把握。
    摆在外长会议面前的事实是：美国在西欧的备战政策已陷入越来越深的危机。美国强使西欧各国接受它以西德重新武装为中心的西欧备战计划的企图，已相继在北大西洋集团理事会渥太华会议及罗马会议上遭到失败。以后，美国虽然曾一再焦急地命令西欧各国，要它们必须在里斯本会议以前对掩护西德军队重建的欧洲军计划取得协议，美、英、法三国必须与西德傀儡政府完成缔结所谓“和平协定”（即所谓美、英、法、德“共同条约”）的谈判，以便里斯本会议能就整个美国计划取得协议。但是，罗马会议结束以后两个多月来，美国仍然无法完成这些步骤。由于西欧各国经济及政治危机继续发展，北大西洋集团内部在武装西德问题和扩军备战问题上的矛盾已更加尖锐。西欧各国对于欧洲军计划一直争吵不休，未能在任何关键问题上取得协议。欧洲军谈判目前已陷入半死不活的状态。同时，美、英、法三国与西德傀儡政府所举行的所谓“和平协定”谈判，也遭到极大困难。美联社波恩十一日电：“谈判自去年九月开始以来，迄无多大进展。”“三个西方国家高级专员十一日起草了一项‘黯淡的、充满着失望的’报告，说在他们与西德方面关于‘和平协定’的谈判中没有一项是进行得顺利的。”
    现在，在里斯本会议行将召开的前夕，北大西洋集团间不仅在这两个问题上原有的纠纷不能解决，而且还不断有新的困难纷至沓来。一月底西德与法国统治集团间从萨尔问题上爆发了激烈的争吵，二月八日西德反动派操纵波恩议会提出了参加欧洲军的狂妄“条件”，二月十一日起法国国民议会辩论欧洲军问题中法国反动派内部发生极大分歧——所有这一连串的事件，都给美国的欧洲军及“和平协定”计划增添了一个又一个棘手的难题。在这种形势下，美国眼看着里斯本会议势将无法通过它的计划，而极度焦虑不安。使美国统治集团更加害怕的是，美国计划这样连遭挫折，将会产生十分严重的后果。法新社透露华盛顿的估计说：“如果里斯本会议不能对欧洲军问题得出具体结果，如果对眼前最棘手的问题（萨尔问题和波恩与大西洋公约的关系问题）不能获得解决办法或解决办法的建议，那末整个美国外交政策就要遭遇严重的危险。”
    在这种深怀恐惧的心情下，美国正竭力企图在伦敦三国外长会议上排除武装西德问题上所遭到的重重困难，以多少改变势将来临的这种厄运。但是，外长会议能否得到结果，却连美国国务卿艾奇逊自己都缺乏信心。他六日在华盛顿记者招待会上说：三国外长还不能决定他们的会谈是否能达到一定协议的阶段。而西德占领当局方面的看法，还要更加悲观。据合众社波恩十二日电：“盟国官员说，关于德国重新武装问题，在今年仲夏以前还不可能得出最后决定。英国高级人士指出：即将在里斯本举行的北大西洋公约组织会议在这方面亦无法获得任何进展。”
