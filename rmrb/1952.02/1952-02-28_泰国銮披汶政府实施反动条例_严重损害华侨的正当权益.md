　　Thailand's Phibun Government Implements Reactionary Regulations
    Seriously Damaging the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The reactionary Phibun government of Thailand recently issued a nationwide order to implement a regulation that severely damages the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese. It stipulates that foreign nationals are prohibited from leasing land and buildings near sluice gates, railway stations, bridges, and road dividers on all lines. Foreign nationals who have already leased land or buildings in the above-mentioned areas will have their lease contracts canceled, or their right to continue leasing will be canceled when the lease contract expires.
    This reactionary regulation of the Thai government is a disguised version of the "restricted area" regulation, which it dared not implement due to the strong opposition of the Overseas Chinese. The implementation of this regulation will subject the vast number of Overseas Chinese residing in Thailand to more severe persecution, because a large number of Overseas Chinese make a living in the above-mentioned areas, and the term of their lease contracts is short, ranging from one or two years to, at most, three or five years. If their contracts are now canceled or they cannot renew after the lease expires, their lives will inevitably become more difficult. Overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life in Beijing who are concerned about the situation of Thai compatriots are extremely angry at the Thai government's implementation of this regulation, which intensifies the persecution of Overseas Chinese. They believe that this reactionary measure by the Thai government is one of a series of military preparations steps in its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants to conspire to harm our country, and they are paying serious attention to it.

　　泰国銮披汶政府实施反动条例
    严重损害华侨的正当权益
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：泰国銮披汶反动政府最近通令全国实施一个严重损害华侨正当权益的条例，规定：禁止外侨租赁水闸、火车站、桥梁和各线马路分路等地区附近的土地及建筑物，而已经租有上述地区的土地或建筑物的外侨，也将被取消租赁合同，或在租赁合同期满时，取消继续租赁的权利。
    泰国政府的这一反动条例是在华侨的坚决反对下不敢实行的“禁区”条例的变相。这一条例的实施，将使居留泰国的广大华侨受到更严重的迫害，因为在上述地区谋生的华侨为数甚多，而他们租赁的合同期限，短的是一年二年，长的也不过三年五载，如果现在被取消合同或在租赁期满后不能续租，那么他们的生活必将更加困难。关心泰国侨胞处境的在京归侨及各界人士对于泰国政府实施这个加紧迫害华侨的条例极表愤怒，认为泰国政府这一反动措施乃系其勾结蒋匪残余阴谋为祸我国的一连串军事准备步骤之一，正予以严重注意中。
