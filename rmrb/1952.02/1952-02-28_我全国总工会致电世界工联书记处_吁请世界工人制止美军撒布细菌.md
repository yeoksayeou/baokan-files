To Comrade Saillant, Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions:

In order to salvage its fate of defeat on the Korean battlefield, American imperialism has not hesitated to violate international law and conventions. From January 28th to February 17th, it has continuously spread a large number of plague, cholera, and other bacteria in the front and rear of Korea, attempting to poison the Korean people with barbarous bacteriological warfare. In addition to lodging a serious protest with the US government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereby requests the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to call on the working class and working people of the world to take effective action to resolutely condemn and stop this inhuman crime of American imperialism!

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The Preparatory Committee of the China Chemical Industry Union and the Preparatory Committee of the China Medical and Health Workers' Union jointly sent a telegram to J. Gattegno, Chairman of the International Federation of Chemical Workers' Unions, and Pozoki, General Secretary, hoping that they would call on chemical workers, engineers, and all medical workers around the world to stop the heinous crime of American imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. The text of the telegram is as follows:

Dear Comrades:

According to the Xinhua News Agency report of February 21st, the American aggressor bandits recently, from January 28th to February 17th, again continuously spread a large number of poisonous insects carrying plague and cholera bacteria in the front and rear of Korea to carry out bacteriological warfare. Prior to this, they had used captured Chinese and Korean prisoners of war for bacteriological experiments on Koje Island and Wonsan, and in December 1950, they spread smallpox bacteria in Pyongyang, Kangwon Province, South Pyongan Province, North Pyongan Province, and other places, and released poison gas at the front line countless times. We hope that the International Federation of Chemical Workers' Unions will call on chemical workers, engineers, and all medical workers, both men and women, around the world to take active action to stop this crime!
