Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: Former U.S. President Hoover's radio address on January 27th, advocating for an immediate change in the Truman administration's current aggression policy, which has met with complete failure, has sparked widespread response within the U.S. ruling circles. According to a United Press report, on February 7th, Hoover issued another statement, reiterating his proposal to "withdraw all U.S. troops stationed abroad and re-examine U.S. foreign policy." This statement was endorsed by sixteen prominent figures in the U.S. military and political circles, including Lieutenant General Wedemeyer and Groves, Admirals Bratt and Yarnell, as well as Admiral Standley, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, former Ambassador to England Kennedy, former Ambassador to Poland Lane, former Ambassador to Cuba Braden, and former Secretary of Commerce Jones, among others.

Many U.S. bourgeois newspapers have expressed support for Hoover's arguments, acknowledging the severe failure of the current U.S. aggression policy. The notoriously reactionary Hearst newspapers believe that Hoover's assessment of the U.S. policy crisis "is realistic and based on historical facts." The "Houston Chronicle" of Texas, referring to Hoover's speech in late 1950 attacking Truman's policy, admitted that "nothing that has happened in the year between Hoover's two warnings has been able to prove anything wrong with the theories invoked by the former president." The "Richmond Times-Dispatch" of Virginia said: "Hoover advocates scaling down our defense (should read as aggression) plans to within the limits allowed by our financial, industrial, and military potential, and his proposal is correct." The "Monthly Bank Letter" of the "City Bank," one of the largest banks in the United States, expressed full agreement with Hoover's views, believing that the United States' massive expansion of armaments has "created a dangerous situation of excessive economic strain." The "Monthly Bank Letter" also acknowledged that the people of Western Europe and the United States have sharply differing opinions and do not need to prepare for war.

The San Francisco progressive newspaper "People's World" pointed out in an editorial commenting on Hoover's speech: "Hoover's recent speech and the discussion about it have once again exposed that certain reactionary big business figures have growing doubts about our country's ongoing war plans. They fear that the large amounts of military spending currently being consumed will not only fail to bring prosperity and stability to the American economy, but will instead cause economic collapse and the bankruptcy of the capitalist system. It is due to this panic and fear that Hoover made an important and startling confession."

    胡佛和魏德迈等联名声明
    承认美现行侵略政策惨败
    【新华社十八日讯】美国前总统胡佛在一月二十七日发表的、主张立即改变已遭到全面失败的杜鲁门政府现行侵略政策的广播演说，已经在美国统治集团内部引起了广泛的响应。据合众社消息，二月七日，胡佛又发表声明，重申他所提出的主张，“建议撤退所有驻在外国的美国军队，并重新检查美国的外交政策”。这个声明获得十六名美国军界与政界著名人物的签名赞成，其中包括陆军中将魏德迈和格鲁夫斯，海军上将布拉特和颜露尔、以及曾任美国驻苏大使的海军上将史坦德雷，前驻英大使肯尼第，前驻波兰大使莱恩，前驻古巴大使布莱登，前商务部长琼斯等人。
    许多美国资产阶级的报刊表示支持胡佛的论点，承认美国现行侵略政策已遭到严重的失败。著名反动的赫斯特系报纸认为胡佛对于美国政策危机的估计“是现实的，是研究过历史事实的”。得克萨斯州的“豪士敦纪事报”提到胡佛在一九五○年年底攻击杜鲁门政策的演说，承认“在胡佛的两次警告之间的一年内所发生的事情，没有一件能够证明这位前任总统所援用的理论有什么错误”。弗吉尼亚州的“里区蒙时代快报”说：“胡佛主张把我国的防务（应读作侵略）计划缩小到我们的财政、工业和军事潜能所允许的限度之内，他的建议是正确的。”美国最大的银行之一“花旗银行”所出版的“银行月报”二月号，表示完全赞同胡佛的意见，认为美国庞大的扩张军备计划在经济上“造成危险的过分紧张的情势”。“银行月报”并且承认：西欧人民和美国的意见截然不同，他们并不需要进行战争准备。
    旧金山的进步报纸“人民世界报”在评论胡佛演说的社论中指出：“最近胡佛的演说以及关于这篇演说的讨论，再度暴露了：某些反动的大企业人士方面，对于我国正在进行的战争计划所怀的疑虑已越来越大了。他们害怕目前正在消耗的大量军费，不但不能给美国经济带来繁荣和稳定，反而会造成经济崩溃和资本主义制度的破产。由于这种恐慌和疑惧，胡佛才发表了重要的而且惊人的招供。”
