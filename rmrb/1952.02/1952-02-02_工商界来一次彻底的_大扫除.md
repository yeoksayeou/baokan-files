The Chinese People's Volunteers are on the snowy and icy Korean front, selflessly and courageously displaying a great spirit of patriotism and internationalism, resisting the frantic aggression of American imperialism and its accomplices, and achieving continuous and glorious victories. The Chinese People's Liberation Army and other People's Armed Forces, after completing the unprecedented historical task of liberating the entire Chinese mainland and Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Islands, are on one hand, fighting with unparalleled bravery to eliminate bandits and special agents, defending national defense, and improving their skills in combat, in preparation for the recovery of Taiwan; on the other hand, they are enthusiastically participating in production to enhance the country's economic strength. Chinese workers and farmers, on one hand, have led the movement to resist America and aid Korea; on the other hand, they have launched a widespread patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy and a patriotic campaign for increased harvests, strongly supporting the front lines, while laying a solid foundation for national construction. The vast numbers of young people, women, and cultural and educational workers have made great progress and contributed greatly to the cause of national construction. The vast majority of state organ personnel, under arduous living conditions, faithfully implement state policies, laws, and plans, demonstrating a high spirit of serving the people. All of this is the mainstream of the new China marching towards the bright path under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Historically, any bright and great mainstream inevitably carries with it an undercurrent. Today, this undercurrent is the erosion of bourgeois ideology—the source of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. These are the poisons left over from the old society, and it is mainly our industrial and commercial sectors that bring these poisons into the new society. At a time when the people of the whole world are cheering for the victory of the new China, and the vast majority of the Chinese people are dedicating themselves to the country with great excitement, a large number of unscrupulous merchants who damage the interests of the state and corrupt state cadres have emerged in the industrial and commercial sectors, which is a disgrace to the industrial and commercial sectors.

The main crimes of the unscrupulous merchants are bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. The most heinous of these is the use of despicable means such as temptation, enticement, and coercion to carry out bribery in order to corrupt national revolutionary cadres; damaging national interests, and even undermining national defense construction and economic construction, is the general inevitable result. Objectively, such people are equivalent to colluding with the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to attack the Chinese people. They naturally become enemies of the people. With this group of unscrupulous merchants in society, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy inevitably develop in government organs.

The ugly behavior of the unscrupulous merchants is not a castle in the air, but has its far-reaching social foundation. "Dark cities" and "turbid business circles" were well-known catchphrases in old China. The city was dark because it was the base camp for the ruling exploiting classes to rule the people in the past; and the business circle was turbid because it was caused by the essence of the bourgeoisie seeking only profit, harming others for their own benefit, and engaging in speculation. From the old customs, stores had to paste red paper strips with "Huge Profits" and "Daily Income of Gold" on the door during the Lunar New Year, worship the God of Wealth, say "Congratulations on getting rich" when meeting during the New Year, and offer "Yuanbao Tea" to guests. These prove that seeking only profit is the "natural law" of the industrial and commercial sectors, and they are not ashamed of it at all. From the things imported from abroad, the commercial law of the reactionary era clearly stipulated: "The purpose of a businessman is to make profit." This further legalized the pursuit of profit. Who can say that seeking only profit is not the essence of the bourgeoisie?

Starting from seeking only profit, one will naturally resort to any means; harming others for one's own benefit and engaging in speculation are all appropriate measures. The more cruelly workers are exploited, the better, because harming others can benefit oneself. "Competitors are enemies," because benefiting oneself cannot but harm others. "Business experience" teaches speculation, which is universally and dispersedly present. Concentrated speculation takes place in the market or exchange. In there, the old way is to feel sleeves to open the market and whisper in the ear to determine the transaction; the foreign way is to frantically grab in front and secretly calculate and manipulate in the back. That is an extremely insidious, despicable, and ugly world of ghosts! When a few people make a "windfall," most people will be ruined! Under this economic system, social life is of course the luxury and extravagance of a few and the hunger and poverty of the majority. The politics built on this foundation are of course corruption, degeneration, and even outright plundering of the people. "People have conscience, dogs don't eat shit," "Heaven punishes those who don't work for themselves"; this is very appropriate for the ruling class at the time. These are the inevitable results of the free development of the bourgeois essence. Chinese history proves this point, and the history of capitalist countries proves this point even more fully.

Although the reactionary and dark rule has been overthrown by the people, and the turbidity in the business circle has also been washed away, the remnants of the old system cannot be eradicated in a short period of time. The national bourgeoisie is still a component of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, which further increases the seriousness of this problem. Naturally, the national bourgeoisie has made progress since liberation; there are also many upright and striving figures among them: but this cannot change its class essence. This dangerous class essence uses every opportunity to strive for free development, which becomes an attack on the people's regime in various forms. This attack does not have a unified organization, but there is a front controlled by price; many people who participate in the attack may be unconscious, but they have a common consciousness of seeking only profit. For example, in the early days of liberation, there were attacks of reselling gold and silver and raising prices. At that time, those speculators with larger capital consciously launched the attack, but the general people who had greedy buying and reluctant selling thoughts only unconsciously participated in this attack. For example, bribery is an extremely serious attack on the people's regime. But in that, those unscrupulous merchants who bribed in order to carry out tax evasion, shoddy work and materials, defrauding state property, and buying information were conscious; general merchants followed past bad habits, did not raise prices, and gave small rebates to the purchasing personnel of the agencies, which was unconscious. This fact shows on the one hand the seriousness of the crimes of those speculators and unscrupulous merchants, and on the other hand the evil and terrible nature of the bourgeois essence—starting from seeking only profit, and finally committing the crime of endangering the country. Of course, the law distinguishes between the punishment of various criminal acts, but the elimination of this bad bourgeois essence must be without exception.

In this way, the erosive nature of bourgeois ideology has become sugar-coated bullets for the revolutionary ranks! In this way, the revolutionary ranks, which basically had no corruption or degeneration in the liberated areas before the victory of the revolution, developed corruption, waste, and bureaucracy after the victory of the revolution and the transition to the cities! This explains what is meant by "the rampant attack launched by the bourgeoisie on the working class and the Chinese Communist Party in the past three years," and also explains why "the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a struggle against the corrupt and decadent thinking of the bourgeoisie." (Bo Yibo: Struggle for a deep and widespread anti-corruption, anti-waste, anti-bureaucracy movement)

Yes, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has its active and progressive side. That is: in order to seek profits, they must carry out the work of developing production and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad, which will be of some help to the people's economy. However, to ensure that the pursuit of profit can achieve mutual benefit between labor and capital, and that the development of production and the promotion of material exchanges can achieve consideration for both public and private interests, in short, all activities can truly help the people's economy, it is necessary to strictly accept the ideological and political leadership of the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, strictly accept the business leadership of the state-owned economy, and strictly obey the state's plans. Otherwise, if it is allowed to develop freely, it must be the brutal profit-seekingism of cruelly exploiting the people, the blind development of both public and private losses, and the ugly crimes of eroding the people's regime.

Facts have proved that the serious crimes of unscrupulous merchants corrupting state cadres have mostly developed after the economic situation improved in the past year or so, and have developed particularly severely in some industries with particularly prosperous business, such as construction, timber, hardware, paper, and western medicine. Why is this so? Because they are thinking: "The country needs me, I have a position"; "Business is easier to do, no need for the leadership of the state-owned economy"; "I have money and status, why rely on workers, let alone the leadership of the working class." It is these arrogant and complacent emotions that have made them deviate from leadership and develop the idea of ​​profiteering and blind development; and in order to obtain huge profits and achieve the goal of blind development, they unscrupulously committed the heinous crimes of corrupting state cadres and harming national interests. This is the inevitable result of free development.

Therefore, there are two paths facing the industrial and commercial sectors:

One is: under the ideological and political leadership of the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, under the business leadership of the state-owned economy, in accordance with the state plan, following the principles of considering both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, actively mobilizing their financial and human resources to serve the people and obtain reasonable profits—this is the bright road.

The other is: despise leadership, despise labor, adhere to the omnipotence of capital, demand free development, and move in the direction of seeking only profit, harming others for one's own benefit, and engaging in speculation—this is a dead end.

I think the industrial and commercial sectors are willing to take the bright road, and no one will be willing to take the dead end. To take the bright road, we must thoroughly transform our thinking and thoroughly rectify the ranks of the industrial and commercial sectors. To achieve these two points, we must actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and launch a struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence within our own ranks.

Those who violate the law must honestly confess their crimes, and those who make mistakes must honestly confess their mistakes; this is the starting point for transforming their thinking and starting anew. Everyone must bravely expose those bad elements who refuse to confess, which is a necessary means to rectify the ranks of the industrial and commercial sectors. When the workers and shop assistants unite, and the women also unite, the eyes of the people cannot be escaped, and those who do not confess will eventually be exposed. Once exposed, the opportunity to reduce or exempt punishment will be missed; correcting mistakes will also be passive. At this critical moment, the industrial and commercial sectors must show great determination and courage to show their firm stand on the side of the people and strive for the revolutionary cause to the end!

The end of the lunar year is the day for "spring cleaning". On this day of "spring cleaning", the industrial and commercial sectors thoroughly clean up the turbidity in their minds and thoroughly clean up the turbidity in the entire industrial and commercial sectors, which is indeed of historical significance. Since these turbidities have been accumulated for thousands of years, it is impossible to clean them all up in one day of "spring cleaning". Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors must continue to work hard, make persistent efforts, and carry out a thorough clean-up!

Finally, I would like to send the industrial and commercial sectors two commonplace words: "Honestly transform your thinking; operate your business properly." I think doing so is beneficial to the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, and it is also beneficial to the unity within the united front. The future of the new China is limitless, and it is glorious and happy to be a people of the new China. I wish the industrial and commercial sectors a successful clean-up, and everyone will work together to be good people of the new China!

    工商界来一次彻底的“大扫除”
    章乃器
    中国人民志愿军正在冰天雪地的朝鲜前线，奋不顾身地，发挥高度爱国主义和国际主义的伟大精神，抗击美帝国主义及其帮凶们的疯狂侵略，取得了不断的光荣胜利。中国人民解放军和其他人民武装部队，在完成了历史上前所未有的解放全中国大陆和海南岛、舟山群岛的光辉任务之后，一面正在以无比英勇的战斗，消灭土匪、特务，拱卫国防，并在战斗中提高技术，以为收复台湾的准备；另一面踊跃参加生产，以增强国家的经济力量。中国的工人和农民，一面有领导地参加了抗美援朝运动；另一面发起广泛的爱国增产节约运动和爱国丰产运动，有力地支援前线，同时为国家建设打好基础。广大的青年、妇女和文教工作者，都有了很大的进步，同时为国家建设事业贡献了很大的力量。全体国家机关工作人员，绝大多数在艰苦的生活条件下，忠实地执行国家政策、法令、计划，发挥了高度的为人民服务的精神。这一切，就是新中国在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下向着光明的大道迈进的主流。
    历史上，任何光明伟大的主流，都不可避免地要随带着一道暗流。在今天，这一道暗流就是资产阶级思想的侵蚀性——贪污、浪费和官僚主义的根源。这些是旧社会遗留下来的污毒，而携带这些污毒到新社会来的，主要的正是我们工商界。当此全世界人民都为新中国的胜利而欢呼，绝大多数中国人民都在万分感奋中献身为国的时候，工商界却出现了大批损害国家利益、腐蚀国家干部的奸商，这是工商界的耻辱。
    奸商们的罪行，主要的是行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报。其中最恶劣的是用诱惑、勾引、胁迫等卑鄙手段实施行贿，以腐蚀国家革命干部；损害国家利益，甚至破坏国防建设和经济建设，则为一般的必然结果。这种人在客观上等于和美蒋匪帮里应外合，袭击中国人民。他们很自然地成为人民的公敌。社会上有这一批奸商，政府机关里就不可避免地发展了贪污、浪费和官僚主义。
    奸商们的丑恶行为并不是空中楼阁，而是有其深远的社会基础的。“都市黑暗”，“商场污浊”：是旧中国为众周知的口头语。都市之所以黑暗，因为它是过去剥削阶级统治人民的大本营；而商场之所以污浊，则是资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质所造成的。从旧的习惯来说，店家旧历新年要在门上贴“一本万利”、“日进斗金”的红纸条，要拜财神菩萨，新年见面要说一声“恭喜发财”，敬客要进“元宝茶”。这些证明了，唯利是图是工商界的“天经地义”，是丝毫不以为耻的。从由外洋进来的东西来说，反动时代的商法就明白规定：“商人以营利为目的。”这是进一步把唯利是图合法化了。谁还能说唯利是图不是资产阶级的本质呢？
    从唯利是图出发，自然就要不择手段；损人利己，投机取巧都是应有文章。剥削工人是愈残酷愈好，因为损人才能利己。“同行是冤家”，因为利己就不能不损人。“生意经”教的就是投机取巧，这是普遍而分散地存在着的。集中的投机取巧的场合，叫做市场或交易所。在那里面，旧的一套是摸袖子开行情，咬耳朵定交易；外洋来的一套是前台疯狂抢夺，后台暗算操纵。那是一个极端阴险、卑鄙、丑恶的鬼世界！当少数人发了“横财”的时候，多数人便要家破人亡！在这种经济制度之下，社会生活当然是少数人的奢侈荒淫和多数人的饥寒交迫。建筑在这一种基础之上的政治，当然是贪污、腐化以至公然掠夺人民。“人有良心，狗不吃屎”，“人不为己，天诛地灭”；这对于当时的统治阶级来说，是十分恰当的。这些就是资产阶级本质自由发展的必然结果。中国历史证明了这一点，资本主义国家的历史更充分地证明了这一点。
    反动黑暗的统治虽然被人民推翻了，商场上的污浊虽然也经过了洗濯，然而，旧制度的残余，却决非短时期所能肃清。民族资产阶级仍然是中国人民民主统一战线的组成部分，更增加了这一问题的严重性。自然，民族资产阶级在解放以后是有进步的；那中间也还有不少正派的和力求进步的人物：但这并不能改变其阶级本质。这一危险的阶级本质利用一切的机会争取自由发展，这就成为种种不同方式的对人民政权的进攻。这种进攻并没有统一的组织，但是有一条由价格所支配的阵线；许多参加进攻的人也许是无意识的，但有其共同的唯利是图的意识。比如，在解放初期，便有倒买金银、高抬物价的进攻。在当时，那些有较大资本的投机家是有意识地发动进攻的，但是一般抱有贪购、惜售思想的人，却只是无意识地参加了这一进攻。又比如，行贿是对人民政权极端严重的进攻。但在那当中，那些为着遂行逃税、偷工减料、诈取国家财物、和收买情报而行贿的奸商是有意识的；一般商家因袭过去恶习，并不抬高货价，而送给机关采购人员以小额回扣的，则是无意识的。这种事实一面说明了那些投机家和奸商的罪恶的深重，一面也说明了资产阶级本质的恶劣和可怕——从唯利是图出发，终至犯了危害国家的罪行。当然，法律对于各种不同情况的犯罪行为的处分是有区别的，但是，这种资产阶级恶劣本质的消除，却必须是毫无例外的。
    就是这样，资产阶级思想的侵蚀性变成了对于革命队伍的糖衣炮弹！就是这样，在革命胜利以前的解放区时代基本上没有贪污、腐化的革命队伍，等到革命胜利转入城市以后，却发展了贪污、浪费和官僚主义！这说明了什么叫做“资产阶级在三年以来向着工人阶级和中国共产党所举行的猖狂进攻”，也说明了何以“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，本质上就是反对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的斗争”。（薄一波：为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争）
    是的，中国民族资产阶级有其积极进步的一面。那就是：为着谋取利润，他们必须进行发展生产和促进城乡、内外物资交流的工作，这对人民经济会有一定的帮助。然而谋取利润要能达到劳资两利，发展生产和促进物资交流要能达到公私兼顾，总之，一切活动要能真正对人民经济有帮助，那就必须严格接受工人阶级和中国共产党的思想领导和政治领导，严格接受国营经济的业务领导，严格服从国家的计划。如其不然，而任其自由发展，那就一定是残酷剥削人民的暴利主义，一定是公私两损的盲目发展，一定是侵蚀人民政权的丑恶罪行。
    事实已经证明了，奸商们严重的腐蚀国家干部的罪行，多数就是在一年多来经济情况好转以后发展起来的，而且是在业务特别繁荣的一些行业，如建筑、木材、五金、纸张、西药等，发展得格外厉害。何以会如此？就因为他们在想：“国家有求于我了，有地位了”；“生意好做了，用不着国营经济的领导了”；“有钱又有地位，何必依靠工人，更说得到什么工人阶级的领导”。正是这些骄傲自满的情绪，使得他们脱离了领导，发展了暴利思想和盲目发展思想；再为着取得暴利，达到盲目发展的目的，就不择手段地做出了伤天害理的腐蚀国家干部、损害国家利益的罪恶勾当。这是自由发展的必然结果。
    因此，摆在工商界的面前有两条路：
    一条是：在工人阶级和中国共产党的思想领导和政治领导之下，在国营经济的业务领导之下，依照国家计划，遵照公私兼顾、劳资两利的方针，积极动员自己的财力和人力，为人民服务，并取得合理的利润——这是光明的大路。
    一条是：藐视领导，轻视劳动，坚持资本万能，要求自由发展，向着唯利是图，损人利己、投机取巧的方向前进——这是死路。
    我想，工商界是愿意走光明的大路的，没有人会愿意走死路的。要走光明的大路，就必须彻底改造自己的思想，彻底整饬工商界的阵容。要做到这两点，就必须积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，并在自己的队伍里面，开展一个反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。
    犯法者必须老老实实地坦白自己的罪行，犯错误者必须老老实实地坦白自己的错误；这是改造思想、从新做人的起点。大家都要勇敢检举那些不肯坦白的坏分子，这是整饬工商界阵容的必要手段。工人、店员群众一致起来了，妇女们也一致起来了，人民的眼睛是逃不过的，不坦白的终久要被检举。等到被检举，减罪、免罪的机会就错过了；改正错误也陷于被动了。工商界在这一个紧要关头，必须拿出重大的决心和勇气，以表示其坚决站在人民的一面，为革命事业奋斗到底！
    旧历年终是“大扫除”的日子。工商界在这一“大扫除”的日子，把自己头脑里的污浊大扫除一下，把整个工商界里的污浊大扫除一下，的确是具有历史意义的。由于这些污浊是千百年来积累下来的，决不可能在“大扫除”的一天就打扫干净。所以，工商界必须继续努力，再接再厉，来一次彻底的大扫除！
    最后，我愿意送给工商界两句老生常谈的话：“老老实实改造思想；规规矩矩经营业务。”我认为这样做，对于工商界自己是有利的，对于统一战线内部的团结也是有利的。新中国的前途是无可限量的，好好地做一个新中国的人民，是光荣、幸福的。预祝工商界大扫除的成功，大家共同做新中国的好人民！
