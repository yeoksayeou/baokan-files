    Chinese Scientists are Willing to Forever Stand with the Soviet People and Strive to Defend World Peace
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed two years ago has strengthened the infinite confidence of peace-loving people all over the world, and at the same time given a fatal blow to the imperialists who妄想to破坏和平. It has brought new joy and hope to the Chinese people, who had just won a comprehensive victory in the domestic revolutionary war, and it has made us realize that the Soviet Union is China's most faithful and greatest friend. Therefore, today, every Chinese person commemorates this great day with extreme excitement and gratification.
    We sincerely thank the Soviet people for their various assistance to our new China. In the past two years, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet allies, various economic and cultural construction undertakings in our country have advanced rapidly. We have restored and newly built many factories and mines; carried out the construction of the Huai River and other water conservancy projects; restored and newly built many railways, and improved their operating rates; prevented the spread of insect pests, and increased agricultural production; and eradicated the prevalence of many regional epidemics. In these aspects, the assistance given to us by the advanced Soviet experience is extraordinarily great. This assistance is one of the main factors that enable our country to rapidly move towards prosperity and strength.
    Chinese scientists are increasingly aware of the progressive role of Soviet science. While those war-mongers are using science to create tools for destroying peace and destroying humanity, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the world's progressive people's teacher and the greatest scientist, Marshal Stalin, are using all the latest achievements in science to carry out the world's unprecedented large-scale great communist construction. This proves that only in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union can science be truly mastered by the people, and therefore can it serve the people according to the will of the people, so as to promote social progress.
    Therefore, in the past two years, Chinese scientific and technical personnel have worked hard to study the most advanced Soviet science and technology and have achieved achievements, so they have played an increasingly important role in various construction undertakings in New China.
    Recently, Chinese scientists are carrying out a great ideological remolding movement. This movement, as Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform and gradually implement industrialization in all aspects. This movement has gained richer content due to the active participation of scientists in various practical struggles in New China. In the past few months, many scientists have conducted preliminary self-criticism and reviewed their past mistakes. It can be seen from the articles they published that Marshal Stalin's writings on linguistics and his talks with the British writer Wells have played a significant enlightening and guiding role in this ideological remolding movement of Chinese scientists.
    I believe that after this ideological remolding movement, Chinese scientists will be more consistent with Soviet scientists on the basis of Marxism-Leninism theory, and thus will be more closely united, and will always strive for the great cause of defending world peace and building a happy society for mankind.

    中国的科学工作者愿永远和苏联人民在一起，为保卫世界和平而奋斗
    中国科学院副院长  李四光
    两年前签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，增强了全世界爱好和平人民的无限信心，同时给与妄想破坏和平的帝国主义者一个致命的打击，它给在国内革命战争中刚取得全面胜利的中国人民带来了新的愉快和希望，它使我们认识了苏联是中国最忠实和最伟大的友人。因此，今天每一个中国人民，都以极端兴奋而快慰的心情来纪念这个伟大的日子。
    我们衷心地感谢苏联人民对我们新中国的各种帮助。两年来，在苏联友邦的热情协助之下，我国各种经济和文化建设事业，以飞快的速度向前突进。我们恢复和新建了许多工厂矿山；进行了淮河以及其他的水利工程建设；恢复和新修了许多铁道，并提高了它们的运转率；防止了虫害的蔓延，提高了农业上的生产量；根绝了许多区域瘟疫的流行。在这些方面，苏联先进经验给与我们的协助是异常巨大的。这些协助，是使得我国能迅速地走向繁荣富强的主要因素之一。
    中国科学工作者日益认清了苏联科学的进步作用。当那些战争贩子正在利用科学来制造破坏和平毁灭人类工具的时候，苏联人民在全世界进步人类的导师和最伟大的科学家斯大林大元帅的领导之下，使用着科学上一切最新成就，来进行世界上空前规模的伟大的共产主义建设。这就证明了，只有在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营里，科学才真正为人民所掌握，因而也才能根据人民的意志去服务于人民，以推动社会前进。
    因此，两年来中国的科学技术人员，努力地研究苏联最先进的科学技术，并获得了成就，因而他们在新中国的各种建设事业上发挥了越来越大的力量。
    最近中国的科学工作者正在进行着伟大的思想改造运动。这个运动，正如毛泽东主席所指出的，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革与逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。这个运动因科学工作者积极参加新中国的各种实际斗争而取得了更丰富的内容。近几个月来，有不少的科学工作者都进行了初步的自我批评，检讨了自己的过去的错误。从他们所发表的文章中可以看出，斯大林大元帅关于语言学的著作以及和英国作家威尔斯的谈话，在我国科学工作者的这种思想改造运动中起了重大的启发和指导的作用。
    我相信，我国科学工作者经过这种思想改造运动，将和苏联的科学工作者在马列主义理论的基础上更加一致，因而将更加亲密地团结在一起，永远为保卫世界和平、建设人类的美满社会的伟大的事业而奋斗。
