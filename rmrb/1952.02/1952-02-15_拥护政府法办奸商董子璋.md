    Supporting the Government's Legal Action Against the Unscrupulous Merchant Dong Zizhang
    Editor: Dong Zizhang, the manager of Beijing Private Qixin Rubber Factory, has consistently evaded taxes, used substandard materials, and bribed cadres since liberation. This factory once accepted an order for raincoats for the Volunteer Army, and Dong Zizhang actually stretched the fabric to steal materials. When cadres inspected the raincoats, Dong would invite them to the theater and take the opportunity to have workers patch up the pinholes in the raincoats. Dong Zizhang undertook the task of making tires for the Volunteer Army, and when some were defective, he would order workers to cut off the defective parts and then attach a new section. Many of the tires he made were short, and he feared that the clients would reject them, so he bribed the receiving clerk. The factory made a batch of artificial legs for disabled veterans, and he, without any conscience, shamelessly mixed reclaimed rubber into the raw materials. From all these instances, the unscrupulous merchant Dong Zizhang is truly a man-eating tiger. The People's Government is entirely correct in arresting him.

    拥护政府法办奸商董子璋
    编辑同志：北京私营企新橡胶厂经理——奸商董子璋，解放后一贯偷税、漏税，偷工减料，贿赂干部。这个厂曾接受过志愿军的雨衣定货，董子璋竟把布碾长，偷取布料。当干部检查雨衣时，董就请干部看戏，并趁机叫工人把雨衣上的砂眼补上。董子璋承做志愿军用的车胎，其中有坏的，就叫工人把坏的部分剪掉，再接上一截。他作的许多车胎，都是短的，他怕委托人不要，就贿赂收货员。该厂给荣誉军人做了一批假腿，他毫无良心，竟卑鄙无耻地在原料里掺入再生胶。从这些地方看来，奸商董子璋实足是一只吃人的老虎。人民政府把他逮捕起来，是完全正确的。
