    (4) They rescued people for two or three hours, and they had rescued forty-two people from the water, including twenty-eight children. These children had been battered by the flood for a long time and were shivering. Durasov touched the children's bodies and said to the light rail driver, "The children are the most promising, send them away first, and then come back to pick us up."
    (5) Soon, a bridge on the road to Kaiyuan was also washed away by the flood, and the light rail car could no longer come back. The Qinghe bridgehead had become an isolated island in the vast ocean, and most of the food stored by the bridge-guarding troops had also been washed away by the flood. At this time, the sky was gradually darkening, but the soldiers were moved by Durasov's great internationalist spirit, and they bravely rescued the victims in the icy and turbulent flood. As a result, more than 150 victims were rescued.
    (6) There was a thirteen-year-old boy named Yuan Yongchang. He was washed to the bottom of the Qinghe Bridge by the flood on the evening of the 14th. He tried hard to climb the inclined beam under the steel beam, but he couldn't climb up. He froze on the inclined beam for a long time.

    （四）就这样抢救了两三个钟头，他们已经从水中救出四十二个人来，其中二十八个是小孩子。这些小孩子被洪水冲激多时，都在打寒颤，杜拉索夫摸摸孩子们的身体对轻油车司机说：“孩子们是最有希望的，先把他们送走，然后再来接我们。”
    （五）不久，往开原路上的一处桥梁也被洪水冲断，轻油车不可能再开回来了；清河桥头已成为汪洋中的孤岛，守桥部队的大部分存粮也被洪水冲走。这时，天色已逐渐黑暗，但是战士们被杜拉索夫的伟大的国际主义精神所感动，都更加勇敢地在冰凉而湍急的洪水中抢救灾民，结果抢救出一百五十多个灾民。
    （六）有一个十三岁的男小孩袁永昌。他被洪水冲到清河桥下时已经是十四日的傍晚，他努力爬上了钢梁下部的斜梁，但是没法子爬上来。在斜梁上冻了很久。
