    Xinhua News Agency, 12th—Following the vigorous strengthening of internationalist propaganda and education work on Sino-Soviet friendship across the country, the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has developed rapidly. The total number of members nationwide has increased from 3.04 million in October 1950 to more than 23.11 million. The Northeast, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest Administrative Regions have all established general branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The general branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the North China Region is currently under preparation. According to incomplete statistics, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has established more than 1,340 branches and more than 62,880 sub-branches nationwide.

    The organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has expanded from cities to vast rural areas. For example, in ten counties of the Tangshan area of Hebei Province, more than 2,370 villages have established Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations, with 2,680 full-time cadres. In southern Sichuan, Hubei and other places, farmer members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association account for more than 70 percent of the total number of members in these regions.

    While developing organizations, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions have cultivated a large number of activists. Last year, Beijing, Lushun-Dalian, Shanxi and other places trained more than 5,000 activists through training courses. Most of these activists are enthusiastic and have become the backbone of Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda work. The Southwest General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has also begun to set up correspondents in various grassroots organizations to regularly reflect the demands and work situations of the majority of members.

    全国已成立分会一千三百多个、支会六万二千多个
    【新华社十二日讯】全国各地大力加强中苏友好的国际主义宣传教育工作后，中苏友好协会的组织迅速发展，全国会员总数已由一九五○年十月的三百零四万人增加到二千三百一十一万多人。东北、华东、中南、西南、西北五大行政区都已成立了中苏友好协会总分会，华北区中苏友好协会总分会正筹备组织中。据不完全统计，中苏友好协会在全国已成立分会一千三百四十多个，支会六万二千八百八十多个。
    中苏友好协会的组织已由城市扩展到广大农村。如河北省唐山专区的十个县，便有二千三百七十多村庄建立了中苏友好协会组织，并有专职干部二千六百八十人。在川南、湖北等地，中苏友好协会的农民会员已占该地区会员总数百分之七十以上。
    各地中苏友好协会在发展组织同时，大量培养积极分子。北京、旅大及山西等地去年通过训练班共培养了五千多名积极分子。这些积极分子大都热心服务，成为中苏友好宣传工作中的骨干。中苏友好协会西南总分会并着手在各基层组织设立通讯员，以定期反映广大会员的要求和工作情况。
