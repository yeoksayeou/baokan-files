　　Do Not Let Illegal Contractors Escape Justice
　　Editor: In July 1951, the Beijing private Yihégōng Construction Company contracted to build part of the factory buildings for the People's Revolutionary Military Commission's China Medical Printing Factory. During the construction period, the manager of the construction company stole a large batch of old wood and old bricks that had been dismantled; upon completion, he even blatantly hauled away a portion of the wood. When workers at the printing factory questioned the unscrupulous merchant, he falsely claimed that he had purchased them at a discount. According to preliminary inspection, he skimped on materials and labor, causing a loss of more than 40 million yuan in state property. Now, the roof of the factory building they constructed is leaking, and large cracks have appeared in the gable walls and gray roof, which may collapse when the rainy season arrives.
　　This unscrupulous merchant used bribery to get cadres to approve the substandard project. In this anti-corruption movement, the unscrupulous merchant refused to confess and even formed a "united front" with a certain cadre from the printing factory. Although a certain cadre from the printing factory has been dealt with by the leadership, the unscrupulous merchant is still at large. I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee conduct a prompt investigation and not allow this illegal contractor to escape justice.

    不要让不法营造商漏网
    编辑同志：一九五一年七月，北京私营义合公营造厂承建人民革命军事委员会所属中华医学印刷厂的一部分厂房。在修建期间，营造厂经理偷了拆下来的大批旧木料和旧砖；完工时，他更明目张胆地拉走了一部分木料。印刷厂工人向奸商责问，奸商谎称是折价买得的。据初步检查，他偷工减料，使国家财产损失了四千多万元。现在，他们所修建的厂房屋顶已漏水，山墙和灰顶都裂了大缝，很可能在雨季到来时要倒坍。
    这个奸商利用向干部行贿的办法，把质量很坏的工程交上了。在这次反贪污运动中，奸商拒不坦白，还和印刷厂某干部订了“攻守同盟”。印刷厂某干部虽已由领导部门处理，而奸商仍逍遥法外，我建议北京市节约检查委员会迅速检查，不要让这种不法营造商漏网。
