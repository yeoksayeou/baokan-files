    The Foundation of the New Program of the Japanese Communist Party
    ——Originally Published in "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" on February 15th
    By Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party

    (I) The Communist Party's New Program Represents the Interests of All the People

    It has been almost four months since the Japanese Communist Party announced its new program.

    The vast majority of workers and peasants unanimously support our new program. They say, "Now, for the first time, we have a clear goal that we can wholeheartedly strive for."

    Among intellectuals, except for a small number influenced by right-wing Socialists and Trotskyists, most warmly support this program.

    Therefore, with the prolongation of the Korean War, not only workers and peasants but also intellectuals are increasingly exploited like slaves. Strikes and peasant struggles are violently suppressed. Since the San Francisco Conference, the suppression has intensified. Recently, workers and employees in the coal mining and electrical industries, private and state-owned railways, postal and telegraph workers, and civil servants in national and municipal agencies have held large-scale strikes. The characteristics of these strikes are: they are carried out under the brutal suppression of the occupation forces and the Yoshida government, and yet, in most cases, the strikers have achieved victory.

    Even textile workers, mostly women, and department store and hotel employees, who were previously manipulated by capitalists, are waging tenacious struggles. Intellectuals are joining the struggle alongside industrial workers, and this struggle is closely linked with the struggle against the separate "peace" treaty at all times.

    Therefore, the strike movement is not only growing in scale but also becoming increasingly politically significant.

    Farmers do not believe the Liberal Party's false rumors about abolishing controls on rice production and consumption, and they are waging a strong struggle to demand the abolition of measures for the compulsory requisition of agricultural products. At the same time, the sentiment for implementing revolutionary land reform is also rising.

    Since mid-1950, the struggle for peace, against the separate "peace" treaty, against the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and re-militarization, carried out under the slogan "Hands off Korea!", has become an important issue in the lives of people throughout the country.

    Despite suppression, women, youth, intellectuals, and religious figures have actively participated in this struggle. As a result, to date, six million people have signed petitions demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

    The vast majority of intellectuals have participated in the movement for peace, resolutely opposing the two treaties brokered by the United States. They support the struggles of workers and peasants, thereby playing an extremely important role. For example, as the International Conference of Physicians and Health Experts is scheduled to be held in Rome, experts and prominent figures in the Japanese medical and public health fields have decided to participate in the work of the conference's preparatory committee.

    Among small and medium-sized manufacturers and national capitalists, there are also many who have expressed their willingness to support our Party's program. The majority of capitalists in Japan, the small and medium-sized manufacturers, oppose the policy of destroying civilian industries and expanding war industries. They resolutely oppose US interference under the guise of so-called defending the free world, and are beginning to advocate more and more resolutely the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, New China, and all the countries of Asia.

    These sentiments have even influenced some large capitalists, because, for them, trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is currently an extremely important issue. Therefore, representatives of these individuals have also expressed their willingness to participate in the international economic conference to be held in Moscow.

    These circumstances have helped to expand the national liberation democratic united front, and naturally have also had a great influence on all political parties. The split in the Socialist Party is the best illustration of this.

    Various factors contributed to the inevitable split in the Socialist Party. But the main reason is that after the separate "peace" treaty and "Security Treaty" imposed on Japan by the United States were ratified, ordinary members of the Socialist Party, as well as workers and peasants under the influence of the Socialist Party, had begun to express greater dissatisfaction with the party's actions. Our program has deepened this dissatisfaction.

    The left wing of the General Council of Trade Unions – Japan's largest trade union federation – attacked the Socialist Party, wanting to prevent it from becoming an anti-labor party. Despite the constant attempts by Suzuki, the Socialist Party chairman who leads the so-called "left wing" of the Socialist Party, to compromise with the right-wing leadership, the Socialist Party still split. The workers resolutely demanded that the Socialists not support the separate "peace" treaty and "Security Treaty," and decided that if the Socialists could not agree to this demand, they would no longer trust them.

    The right wing of the Socialist Party is a corrupt group of politicians who previously prevailed in the Socialist Party Executive Committee. But because they actually supported the separate "peace" treaty and "Security Treaty," and adopted a blatant pro-American stance, they have almost completely lost the support of the masses in trade unions and agricultural associations. Currently, they only receive support from a small number of right-wing elements in the leadership of these groups. Therefore, the right wing of the Socialist Party, whose leadership is controlled by illegally released war criminals, has become a thorough running dog of the anti-national capitalists.

    Therefore, disagreeing with the ratification of the separate "peace" treaty and "Security Treaty" orchestrated by the United States, a progressive opposition group, led by representatives of national capitalists, has also emerged within the Democratic Party. Several Democratic Party members of parliament voted against the ratification of this "treaty" and "Security Treaty" and were therefore forced to leave the party. The internal turmoil within the Democratic Party has thus become more serious.

    Even within the reactionary "Liberal" Party, the influence of those who have anti-American and anti-Yoshida sentiments has gradually manifested itself. These sentiments became more apparent after the local government elections in the spring of 1951. Many people have decided to leave the Liberal Party. Prominent figures who are now openly expressing dissatisfaction with Yoshida's policies include the Minister of Communications in the Tanaka Cabinet, the large monopoly capitalist Fusanosuke Kuhara, and Shigesaburo Oishi, the former Minister of Finance in the Yoshida Cabinet.

    Recently, in Kochi Prefecture – Yoshida's birthplace and a stronghold of the Liberal Party – the candidate nominated by the anti-American and anti-Yoshida group was elected as governor of the prefecture. This shows that since the "peace" treaty and "Security Treaty" were ratified, anti-American and anti-Yoshida sentiments have continued to grow among the people.

    As the anti-national pro-American elements led by Yoshida are rapidly becoming increasingly isolated, US Vice President Barkley, Secretary of State Advisor Dulles, Assistant Secretary of State Rusk, and Economic Advisor Dodge, who came to Japan to accelerate the conclusion of the so-called Administrative Agreement on the stationing of US troops in Japan and the rearmament of Japan, had to return to the United States empty-handed. The people's protests have made it impossible for the Yoshida group to openly carry out rearmament activities and have forced it to resort to deceptive means, using the guise of strengthening police forces to carry out rearmament activities.

    Our new program has in fact increasingly become the program of all the people.

    Right-wing Social Democrats are fiercely attacking our program, attempting to slander it and weaken its influence on the masses. The cunning of right-wing Social Democrats and other groups hostile to the working class lies in the fact that they are secretly active, helping the US occupation forces and the Yoshida government to carry out brutal suppression of our Party. Simply put, they slander our Party in an attempt to cover up their anti-national, counter-revolutionary actions and deceive the masses. We must expose their slanders, and do our utmost to raise the class and political consciousness of the people throughout the country, further strengthen the revolutionary forces, and consolidate the national liberation democratic united front.

    (II) Why We Stipulate That the Revolution Is a National Liberation Democratic Revolution

    The new program has pointed out that the most serious problem currently facing the Japanese nation is that the US occupation brings suffering to the Japanese people, and the Yoshida government has become the spiritual and political pillar of the occupation system.

    The new program explains these problems very clearly. It is precisely for this reason that the new program has been supported by the majority of the people, led by workers and peasants. Because of the signing of the separate "peace" treaty and "Security Treaty" in San Francisco, and because Japan has openly transformed into a US military base preparing to invade the Soviet Union, New China, and the countries of Asia, the already difficult situation of our nation has become even more serious. The US imperialists have repeatedly said that their actions are taken in the spirit of "equality" and "respect for sovereignty," and for the "benefit of peace." It is obvious that their actions are not like this.

    As mentioned above, the so-called administrative agreement regarding the conditions for the implementation of the "Security Treaty" has not yet been published, but has already been implemented. The following facts clearly illustrate this point:

    US Air Force bases are being built in thirty-two locations across the country, the largest of which is the Tachikawa base on the outskirts of Tokyo. These bases occupy large tracts of land – one area has three to six major facilities, and the surrounding areas are completely utilized for military bases. For example, the area of the base centered on Tachikawa extends southwest to Yokohama and Yokosuka, southeast to Kisarazu, and northwest to Yokota. Almost the entire area of Tokyo Prefecture, except for old Tokyo, is used for this base. A pipeline is being laid from Yokohama through Tachikawa to Yokota. Between Yokosuka and Yokota, facilities such as warehouses, ports, houses, and military repair and assembly plants are being built. To transport equipment to all these facilities, a wide highway is being constructed. A large area of our country is thus being utilized for this military base.

    In addition, in fourteen locations across the country, former naval bases – primarily Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo, as well as important ports such as Kobe and Yokohama, and convenient seaports – have been used as naval bases. These bases combined are three times more numerous than Japan's previous naval bases. As for ground troop bases, the Americans are arbitrarily building such bases throughout our country. The Americans conduct military exercises wherever they please. Because of the US military conducting these exercises, and because of the Korean War, the people are suffering serious losses and receiving no compensation.

    70 to 80 percent of state-owned railways, state-owned post offices, telegraph and telephone systems, and important industrial sectors such as electricity, steel, petroleum, coal, and chemicals are practically exclusively used by the US occupation forces. The occupation forces can freely utilize major highways, hotels, and other facilities.

    To maintain and utilize these huge military bases, the US military's control over the Japanese economy is being strengthened. Recently, this control has expanded to monopolistic enterprises and the financial industry – these monopolistic enterprises and the financial industry are now completely subordinate to the United States.

    Even the large capitalists who manufacture orders for the US occupation forces are suffering losses because the prices of the goods they supply are being suppressed. Only a small number of capitalists who violate national interests receive huge profits from fulfilling the occupation forces' order contracts. But in this case, the main burden falls first on the working class. The number of accidents in industry has increased dramatically; workers' health is being harmed. The number of people suffering from lung diseases has recently increased sharply; nearly 30 percent of all workers now suffer from lung diseases.

    At the same time, the poverty of farmers is also becoming more and more severe, because on the large areas of land used as military bases, farmers' fields are being confiscated and cultivation is being reduced.

    It can be seen that the entire nation is suffering destruction on a large scale.

    To achieve their military objectives, the US occupation forces not only rigidly formulate specific economic policies for Japan, but also adopt outright fascist methods to suppress the people's resistance, restrict freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and establish control over education.

    Despite the signing of the "peace" treaty, the US occupation system has not become milder, but has become more brutal. For example, the fact that Dodge's single order completely changed next year's budget clearly illustrates this point. The Yoshida government has almost completely released war criminals. It intends to propose the Group Regulation Law and the Anti-Strike Law. The system of revering the Emperor as a god is being restored. The United States is supplying the Police Reserve Force and the Maritime Safety Agency with complete equipment, spending huge sums of money to transform them into a massive army. They are commanded and trained by US officers. Therefore, the Yoshida government has increasingly openly revealed its fascist face, wholeheartedly serving the United States of America. Japan's anti-national reactionary forces are in power with the assistance of the United States, and they are following an extreme anti-national policy aimed at ensuring their own interests. These anti-national actions will inevitably lead Japan to a state of slavery, as can be clearly seen from the examples of Greece, West Germany, Latin American countries, and even Britain, France, and other Western European countries.

    The US-Japan "Security Treaty" vividly demonstrates this point. The first article of this "Security Treaty" mentions "aid to suppress large-scale riots and disturbances in Japan caused by incitement or interference from one or more foreign countries at the explicit request of the Japanese government."

    This "aid" will become an excuse for the US military to continue to directly interfere in Japan's internal affairs. These facts very clearly show what the "free world" touted by the United States actually is, and what the nature of the "peace treaty" it has created is. In fact, this will inevitably lead to the most serious and destructive war. This is the essence of the US monopoly capital that is willing to sacrifice the entire world to obtain profits.

    There is no doubt that Japan has become a country completely subordinate to the United States.

    From what basic viewpoint does the Communist Party handle the problem of revolutionary movements in colonies and dependent countries? Comrade Stalin answered this question in his speech at the joint plenary session of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolshevik) on August 1, 1927:

    "It consists in strictly distinguishing the revolution in imperialist countries, i.e., countries that oppress other peoples, from the revolution in colonies and dependent countries, i.e., countries oppressed by imperialism of other countries. Revolution in an imperialist country is one thing, where the bourgeoisie is the oppressor of other peoples, where the bourgeoisie is counter-revolutionary at all stages of the revolution, and where there is no national factor as an element of the liberation struggle. Revolution in colonies and dependent countries, however, is another thing, where the oppression of imperialism of other countries is one of the revolutionary factors; where this oppression cannot but also harm the national bourgeoisie; where the national bourgeoisie can support the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement in their country at a certain stage and for a certain period; and where the national factor as an element of the liberation struggle, is a revolutionary factor.

    Failure to make this distinction, failure to understand this difference, equating the revolution in imperialist countries with the revolution in colonial countries—this is deviating from the path of Marxism, deviating from the path of Leninism, and taking the path of the supporters of the Second International."

    This is the theoretical basis of our Party's new program.

    Our Party has determined that Japan's future revolution is a national liberation democratic revolution. In response to the nature of this revolution, our Party has put forward the goal of overthrowing the reactionary Yoshida "Liberal Party" government and establishing a united government representing the interests of all progressive and liberation forces in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary and possible to expand the revolutionary forces as much as possible and organize a broad national liberation democratic united front.

    In the domestic and international political situation created by the US occupation in Japan, we believe that it is not without such a possibility, that is, many capitalists will support the struggle to establish a free and independent Japan and obtain independent economic, political, and cultural life, while other capitalists will maintain friendly neutrality in this struggle.

    Now, for the first time, we have clarified this fundamental issue that we have not been able to properly understand. This enables us to publish our new program with great confidence.

    (III) Why We Believe That the Land Question and the Abolition of Feudal Relations in Rural Areas Are of Great Significance

    The new program has determined such a goal: national liberation democratic revolution.

    The purpose of this revolution is to eliminate feudal remnants in Japanese society. Since in today's Japan, the democratic revolution will be closely linked to national liberation, undoubtedly this revolution will develop on a large scale.

    The new program says: "We say that the Yoshida government refers to the anti-national reactionary forces in Japan who support the reactionary 'Liberal' Party and the Yoshida government. These forces are the Japanese Emperor, the old reactionary military cliques, privileged bureaucrats, landlords, and monopoly capitalists, who exploit and encourage the exploitation of the Japanese people." These reactionary forces are either landlords whose land is to be confiscated, or those whose interests are linked to the landlords. The program emphasizes that "the first decisive step on the road to liberating Japan from the occupation system" is to overthrow these reactionary forces and eliminate the pillars of the US occupation system.

    Right-wing Social Democrats and "left"-leaning adventurers attack our Party's policy on peasants, insisting that we do not understand the situation of peasants at all. They insist that as a result of the "land reform" implemented under the rule of the US occupation forces after the war, land has already been distributed among the peasants; the problem now is that, under the current circumstances, agriculture is unprofitable and investment in agriculture is extremely insufficient. They believe that it is right for forests to remain in the hands of the government. Therefore, their argument is that there is no longer any need for land reform. In fact, the unbearable financial burden borne by poor and middle peasants is precisely the result of this false "land reform." The peasants have fallen into a situation where they are bound to lose their land. Now, the landlords are in fact restoring semi-feudal land ownership. The US imperialists and anti-national reactionary forces, utilizing feudal remnants, are trying to turn the peasants into their slaves and turn the countryside into the main source of cannon fodder.

    Therefore, the views of the right-wing Social Democrats represent the interests of the landlords and are essentially no different from the views of the current government.

    The purpose we want to achieve through land reform is to abolish feudal remnants in all aspects of the lives of the Japanese people, and on this basis, develop agriculture and improve the living standards of peasants. Therefore, this is not just a matter of distributing arable land, but also includes issues such as mountain forests, barren land, irrigation and other farmland projects, as well as compulsory payment of agricultural products and taxes. The Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, and New China are vivid examples of how, after the abolition of feudal remnants, peasants in the new countryside have shown amazing creativity in all aspects and greatly developed agricultural production. Only by carrying out revolutionary land reform to give all the land of the landlords to the peasants without compensation can this step be achieved.

    Mountain forest areas are of great importance to agriculture and must be distributed to the peasants. Cultivable areas must be reclaimed into arable land. In areas that can be converted into grasslands and pastures, improvement work should be carried out. The work of planting trees and afforestation should be carried out by the peasants themselves, and reform and irrigation work should be done jointly by peasant organizations.

    Large-scale agricultural production can only be carried out, and the living standards of peasants can only be improved on this basis, when the government supports the efforts of peasants and gives them all possible assistance.

    It is impossible to fundamentally improve the situation of peasants without implementing this revolutionary land reform. Without implementing this reform, it is impossible to gradually develop agriculture, and therefore, it is impossible to improve the lives of the working class and fundamentally change the lives of all the people. However, this cannot be achieved without overthrowing the reactionary forces in Japan and changing the national system, that is, without abolishing the Emperor system and establishing a democratic republic.

    Our program also clearly defines the demands regarding the question of the working class. This program demands the abolition of semi-feudal exploitation of labor, the freedom to organize trade unions for the working class, and the serious improvement of the material conditions of workers.

    The new program believes that the land question and the abolition of feudal relations in rural areas are of great significance. Therefore, we must correctly determine the actual demands of the peasants and ensure that these demands are realized.

    Based on this, our Party's program clearly points out that only by relying on the strength of a broad national liberation democratic united front can these tasks be accomplished, can revolutionary democratic reforms be realized in Japan, and can the national liberation democratic revolution be realized. The basis of this front is the worker-peasant alliance – the main force of the Japanese people's liberation struggle. Participating in this alliance will also be handicraftsmen and small merchants, small and medium-sized factory owners, as well as a considerable number of industrialists and merchants who have suffered from the occupation system and the reactionary laws of the Yoshida government. Opportunists like Yamakawa advocate carrying out the revolution only with the strength of the working class, treating the interests of peasants the same as the interests of landlords and rich peasants, and ignoring national capitalists. It is clear that such a policy is to split the people, isolate the working class; this policy serves the interests of the imperialists and anti-national reactionary forces, and its purpose is to strangle the revolution.

    (IV) Under the Banner of Peace and Democracy

    Not long ago, our country's struggle for independence, freedom, and peace had not yet fully developed. In some sections of our people, there were still some people who, in one way or another, served as servants of the Americans. They believed that the US imperialist ambition to dominate the world was so powerful that it could not be resisted. However, facts have proven that US imperialism is a paper tiger. In October 1950, when the Chinese People's Volunteers went abroad to aid Korea, and the Chinese democratic parties, led by the Communist Party, declared that US imperialism was a paper tiger and bravely stood up to fight it, many people did not believe that this struggle would be victorious. However, the subsequent course of the Korean War clearly demonstrated the weakness of US imperialism.

    The people of Southeast Asian countries and the Vietnamese people, emulating the example of the great October Socialist Revolution in Russia and the People's Revolution in China, were the first to rise up to fight against imperialist interference and for independence. This national liberation movement has achieved victories that no imperialist can erase. Its influence has spread to the Near East and the Middle East, and also to the people of North Africa. In these countries, the momentum of the liberation struggle has reached an unprecedented level. It is clear that the US imperialist policy of attempting to invade the peace camp led by the Soviet Union has also failed even in capitalist Europe. The meaning of the US imperialists' so-called "aid" is to manipulate the economies of the countries receiving aid, interfere in their internal affairs, turn them into dependent countries, and establish a "European army" to invade the peace camp. Currently, in all these countries, financial systems and economies are increasingly bankrupt, and people are increasingly impoverished. As a result, a tendency to refuse to participate in the US imperialists' mercenary armies has emerged. Therefore, their plans to build huge war bases are also clearly doomed to failure.

    The entire historical process since the success of the great October Socialist Revolution and the birth of the Soviet Union has proven that the Soviet Union, the standard-bearer of peace, the leader and mentor of the working people – led by Comrade J.V. Stalin – has consistently adopted a policy of peace. It is this policy that has become the foundation for the establishment of the current worldwide peace camp. On the other hand, we have all seen with our own eyes that the US imperialists are pursuing war at all times. Even in the United States, ordinary people know that the monopoly capitalists who advocate world hegemony and their political running dogs are nothing more than a gang of bandits. As a result, a situation has been created where anyone who does not belong to this group of bandits cannot expect to find a position in a state agency if they do not express "loyalty" to fascism under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Now, US workers, disregarding the orders of capitalists and the laws prohibiting strikes, are increasingly frequently taking strike action, soldiers are increasingly losing their combat capabilities, and ordinary citizens are increasingly openly expressing dissatisfaction with the government's policies.

    The international situation very clearly shows that the international peace camp is a powerful ally of our country's national liberation democratic front. Fearing the intimidation of the occupation forces, harboring illusions about the so-called "free world," and attempting to maintain a neutral position – this is currently the most harmful thing for our country.

    Any attempt to rely on US imperialism will bring fatal disasters to Japan. The past experiences of Hitler, Tojo, and Mussolini have demonstrated this point.

    The situation in People's China shows that, under new conditions, even capitalists can participate in the national liberation movement. Therefore, our country's capitalists must also change their thinking.

    If we relax our fighting spirit against the US occupation forces and the Yoshida traitorous government, the suppression will undoubtedly become more brutal. They have trampled the Potsdam Proclamation, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, which determined the occupation policy, under their feet. They have carried out various activities to use the Japanese armed forces that are now being re-established to participate in the Korean United Nations forces, regardless of the loss of life and property caused by these activities. They refuse to compensate for the losses caused by aircraft crashes and accidental bomb explosions, not to mention daily losses. We must resolutely organize the people to carry out a revolutionary struggle against the reactionary forces in Japan to overthrow the reactionary Yoshida government that has become the spiritual and political pillar of the occupation system; we must fight against all the illegal actions of the US imperialists. If we carry out this resolute struggle, the US imperialists will be forced to retreat, and we will achieve victory.

    Our program clearly shows that its foundation is the struggle to establish an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan. This struggle will not be victorious if it is not combined with the struggle to achieve the daily political and economic demands of the working class, peasants, and all the people. Only when this struggle is developed on the basis of the close alliance of workers and peasants (who constitute the vast majority of the Japanese people) will this struggle be victorious.

    The victorious struggle of the people of all strata in Japan must be carried out on the basis of this alliance. This is also proven by the call issued by intellectuals to struggle against the separate "peace" treaty and the so-called "Security Treaty" unilaterally arranged by the United States.

    We resolutely reject the deceptive policies of adventurers who disregard the interests of workers and peasants. Only by following the path prescribed in the program can we complete our national liberation democratic revolution.

    The Japanese Communist Party calls on: first, workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and second, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and other capitalists, should actively participate in the national liberation democratic united front and carry out a resolute struggle under the banner of peace and democracy.

    日本共产党新纲领的基础
    ——原载二月十五日“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    日本共产党总书记  德田球一
    （一）共产党的新纲领代表全体人民的利益
    自从日本共产党公布新纲领以来，已经将近四个月了。
    绝大多数的工人和农民都一致拥护我们的新纲领。他们说：“现在，我们第一次有了一个可以全心全意地为之奋斗的清楚的目标。”
    在脑力劳动者中，除了在右翼社会党人和托洛茨基分子影响下的少数人以外，大多数人也热烈拥护这个纲领。
    因此，随着朝鲜战争的延长，不仅工人和农民，就是脑力劳动者也像奴隶一样地日益受到剥削。罢工和农民斗争受到暴力的镇压。在旧金山会议以后，镇压更变本加厉。最近，煤矿业和电气工业、私营铁道和国营铁道的工人和职员，邮政和电报工人，国家机关和市政机关的公务员，都举行了大罢工。这些罢工的特点是：它们是在占领军和吉田政府的残酷镇压的条件下进行的，尽管如此，在大多数情况下，罢工者仍然取得了胜利。
    甚至妇女占多数的纺织工人和不久以前一直受资本家操纵的百货公司和旅馆的职员，也在进行顽强的斗争。脑力劳动者和知识分子正与产业工人一起参加斗争，这个斗争时时刻刻都是与反对单独“和”约的斗争密切联系着的。
    所以，罢工运动不仅规模越来越大，而且越来越富有政治意义了。
    农民不相信自由党关于取消对稻米的生产和消费的管制的虚假谣言，他们正在进行强有力的斗争要求废除强迫征收农产品的措施。同时，要求实行革命的土地改革的情绪也越来越高涨。
    自从一九五○年年中以来，在“不许干涉朝鲜！”的口号下进行的争取和平、反对单独“和”约、反对日美“安全条约”和重新军国主义化的斗争，已经成为全国人民生活中的一个重要问题。
    尽管受到镇压，妇女、青年、知识分子和宗教界人士都积极地参加了这个斗争。结果，到今天，已有六百万人签名要求缔结五大国和平公约。
    绝大多数的知识分子参加了争取和平的运动，坚决反对美国包办的两个条约。他们支持工人和农民的斗争，从而起了极其重要的作用。例如，由于国际医师和卫生专家会议预定在罗马举行，日本医药界和公共卫生界的专家和著名人物都已经决定参加会议筹备委员会的工作。
    在中小制造商和民族资本家中，也有许多人表示愿意支持我党的纲领。构成日本资本家的多数的中小制造商，反对摧毁民用工业、扩大战争工业的政策。他们断然反对美国在所谓保卫自由世界的掩饰下进行干涉，并开始越来越坚决地主张与苏联、新中国以及亚洲的一切国家建立友好关系。
    这些情绪甚至影响了某些大资本家，因为，对他们说来，与苏联和中华人民共和国的贸易在目前是一个极其重要的问题。所以，这些人士的代表也表示愿意参加将在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议。
    这些情况帮助扩大了民族解放民主统一战线，自然也对所有的政治党派产生了很大的影响。社会党的分裂就是一个最好的说明。
    各种不同的因素促成了社会党的不可避免的分裂。但主要的原因是：在美国强迫日本签订的单独
    “和”约和“安全条约”批准之后，社会党的普通党员以及在社会党影响之下的工人和农民都已开始对社会党的行动表示更大的不满。我们的纲领加深了这种不满的情绪。
    工会总评议会——日本最大的工会联合会——领导机构中的左翼抨击社会党，要阻止它变成反劳工的党。尽管领导社会党的所谓“左派”的社会党主席铃木不断想和右翼领导方面妥协，但是社会党还是分裂了。工人坚决要求社会党人不要支持单独“和”约和“安全条约”，并且决定：如果社会党人不能答应这个要求，就不再信任他们。
    社会党右翼是一个贪污腐化的政客集团，他们以前在社会党执行委员会占得上风。但是由于他们实际支持单独“和”约和“安全条约”，并且采取明目张胆的亲美态度，他们在工会和农会里差不多已完全丧失了群众的支持。目前，他们只得到这些团体的领导方面少数右翼分子的支持。因此，领导权为非法开释的战犯所掌握的社会党右翼，已经彻头彻尾变成反民族的资本家的走狗了。
    因此不同意批准在美国策划的单独“和”约和“安全条约”，国民民主党内也出现了一个以民族资本家代表为首的进步的反对集团。国会中有几个国民民主党议员投票反对批准这个“和”约和“安全条约”并且因此被迫脱离该党。国民民主党内部的动摇因此就更形严重。
    即使在反动的“自由”党里面，那些有反美和反吉田的情绪的人们的影响也逐渐表现出来了。在一九五一年春季地方政府选举之后，这些情绪更明显。许多人都已决定脱离自由党。现在公然对吉田政策表示不满的著名人物中有田中内阁的递信相、大垄断资本家久原房之助和吉田内阁前藏相石桥?山。
    最近在高知县——吉田的诞生地、自由党的堡垒——由反美和反吉田集团所提名的候选人当选为县知事。由此可见，自从“和”约和“安全条约”得到批准以来，反美和反吉田的情绪已在人民中不断增涨了。
    由于以吉田为首的反民族的亲美分子迅速地日益陷于孤立，为了加速缔结关于美军驻日和重新武装日本的所谓行政协定而到日本来的美国副总统巴克莱、国务卿顾问杜勒斯、助理国务卿鲁斯克和经济顾问道奇，都不得不毫无所获地返回美国。人民的抗议使得吉田集团无法公然进行重新武装的活动，并迫使它不得不采取欺骗手段，用加强警察力量的幌子来进行重新武装的活动。
    我们的新纲领实际上已日益成为全体人民的纲领。
    右翼社会民主党人猛烈抨击我们的纲领，企图诽谤它并削弱它对群众的影响。右翼社会民主党人和敌视工人阶级的其他集团的奸猾就在于他们是暗中活动、帮助美国占领军和吉田政府来对我党进行残酷的镇压的。简单地说来，他们诽谤我们的党，是企图掩盖他们的反民族的、反革命的行动并欺骗群众。我们必须揭露他们的诽谤，并尽我们的全部力量来提高全国人民的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，进一步加强革命力量并巩固民族解放民主统一战线。
    （二）为什么我们规定革命是民族解放民主革命
    新纲领已经指出，目前日本民族面临的最严重的问题是：美国的占领为日本人民带来痛苦，吉田政府成为占领制度的精神上和政治上的支柱。
    新纲领极清楚地解释了这些问题。正由于这种原因，新纲领得到以工人和农民为首的大多数人民的拥护。由于在旧金山签订单独“和”约和“安全条约”，同时由于日本已公开转变为正在准备侵略苏联、新中国和亚洲国家的美国的军事基地，我们民族的已很困难的处境就变得更加严重。美帝国主义者一再说，他们的行动都是根据“平等”和“尊重主权”的精神，为了“和平的利益”而采取的。显而易见，他们的行动并不是如此。
    上面已经说过，关于执行“安全条约”的条件的所谓行政协定，内容还没有公布，却已付诸实施。以下的事实清楚地说明这一点：
    全国三十二个地方正在建筑美国空军基地，最大的一个空军基地是东京郊外的立川基地。这些基地占据大片土地——一个地区有三个至六个主要设备，周围的地带完全供军事基地利用。例如以立川为中心的基地的地区向西南延伸到横滨和横须贺，向东南延伸到木更津，向西北延伸到横田。除了旧东京以外，东京都几乎全部地区都供这个基地利用。从横滨经过立川通往横田的油管正在敷设中。在横须贺与横田之间，仓库、港口、房屋、军事修理装配厂等设备正在建筑中，为了把装备运往这一切设备，一条宽阔的公路正在修筑中。我国的一大片地区就这样供这个军事基地利用。
    此外，在我国十四个地方，旧海军基地——首先是横须贺、吴港和佐世保，以及神户和横滨等重要港口和便利的海港，已被用作海军基地。这些基地总加起来比日本以前的海军基地数目多三倍。至于地面部队基地，美国人正在我国各地任意建筑这种基地。美国人高兴在哪里进行军事演习就在哪里进行军事演习。由于美国军队进行这种演习，由于朝鲜战争，人民正在受着严重损失，而得不到任何赔偿。
    国营铁路、国营邮局、电报和电话系统以及电气、钢铁、石油、煤、化学等重要工业部门，有百分之七十至八十实际上专供美国占领军使用。占领军可以随意利用主要公路、旅馆等设备。
    为了维持和利用这些巨大的军事基地，美国军队对日本经济的控制正在加强着。最近这种控制已经扩展到独占企业和金融业中——这些独占企业和金融业现在完全附属于美国。
    甚至连替美国占领军制造订货的大资本家，也因为他们所供应的货物的价格被压低而遭受损失。只有少数违反民族利益的资本家才因履行占领军的订货合同而得到巨额利润。但是在这种情况下，主要负担首先落在工人阶级肩上。工业中事故的次数剧增；工人的健康正在遭受损害。最近患肺病的人数骤增；现在全体工人当中有将近百分之三十患肺病。
    同时，农民的贫困也愈来愈厉害，因为在用作军事基地的大片地域上，农民的田地正在被没收着，耕作正在缩减着。
    由此可见，整个民族正在大规模地遭受毁灭。
    美国占领军为了达到他们的军事目的，不但硬给日本制订具体的经济政策，而且还采取道地的法西斯办法来镇压人民的抵抗，限制言论、集会和结社的自由，建立对教育的控制。
    尽管签订了“和”约，美国占领制度不是变得温和些，反而变得更残暴了。例如，道奇一道命令就完全改变了明年度的预算的事实，就明白地说明这一点。吉田政府差不多把战争罪犯全部释放了。它打算提出团体等规正法和禁止罢工法。把天皇尊之为神的制度正在恢复中。美国正在供给警察后备队和海上保安队以齐全的装备，要花费巨额款项，把它们变为一支庞大的军队。它们由美国军官统率和训练。因此，吉田政府已日益露骨地表现出它的法西斯面貌，一心一意地为美利坚合众国服务。日本的反民族的反动势力是在美国协助下当权的，他们正在遵循一个旨在确保他们自己利益的极端反民族的政策。这些反民族的行动不可避免地要使日本陷于奴隶状态，这可以从希腊、西德、拉丁美洲各国，甚至从英国、法国及其他西欧国家的例子中清楚地看到。
    日美“安全条约”生动地证明了这一点，这个“安全条约”的第一条就提到“为了镇压日本国内因受一个外国或一个以上的外国煽动或干涉而引起的大规模暴动和骚乱，得在日本政府的明白请求下给予援助”。
    这种“援助”将成为美国军队继续直接干涉日本内政的一个藉口。这些事实非常清楚地表明了美国所侈谈的“自由世界”实际上是什么东西，也表明了它所制造的“和约”具有怎样的性质，实际上，这势将造成最严重的和破坏性最大的战争。这就是为了获得利润愿意牺牲整个世界的美国垄断资本的本质。
    日本已经沦为一个完全附属于美国的国家，这已是毫无疑问的了。
    共产党是从什么基本观点出发来处理殖民地和附属国的革命运动问题的呢？斯大林同志一九二七年八月一日在联共（布）中央委员会和中央监察委员会联合全会上的演说中答复这个问题说：
    “它是在于把帝国主义国家、即压迫别国人民的国家里的革命，同殖民地和附属国、即受别国帝国主义压迫的国家里的革命，加以严格的区别。帝国主义国家里的革命是一回事情，在那里资产阶级是别国人民底压迫者，在那里资产阶级在革命底一切阶段上都是反革命的，在那里没有作为解放斗争因素的民族因素。殖民地和附属国里的革命，则是另一回事情，在那里别国帝国主义底压迫是革命因素之一；在那里这种压迫不能不也损害民族资产阶级，在那里民族资产阶级在某一阶段上和某一时期内可以支持本国反帝国主义的革命运动，在那里作为解放斗争因素的民族因素，是革命因素。
    不作这个区别，不了解这个差别，把帝国主义国家里的革命和殖民地国家里的革命等同起来，——这就是离开马克思主义底道路，离开列宁主义底道路，而走上第二国际拥护者底道路了。”
    这就是我党新纲领的理论基础。
    我党确定日本将来的革命是民族解放民主革命。针对这个革命的性质，我党提出了推翻吉田“自由党”反动政府和建立代表日本一切进步和解放力量利益的联合政府的目标。因此，就有必要而且有可能尽量扩大革命力量，组织一个广泛的民族解放民主统一战线。
    在美帝国主义者的占领在日本造成的国内外政治形势下，我们认为不是没有这样的可能性，就是说，许多资本家会支持为了争取建立自由独立的日本和获得独立的经济、政治和文化生活而进行的斗争，其他的资本家则会在这个斗争中保持友好的中立。
    现在，我们第一次明确了我们一向未能适当了解的这个基本问题。这使我们能够抱着极大的信心发表我们的新纲领。
    （三）为什么我们认为土地问题与废除农村封建关系有着重大的意义
    新纲领确定了这样的目标：民族解放民主革命。
    这个革命的目的在于扫除日本社会中的封建残余。由于在今天的日本，民主革命将与民族解放密切联系在一起，无疑的，这个革命会大规模地发展起来。
    新纲领说：“我们说吉田政府是指拥护反动的
    ‘自由’党和吉田政府的日本反民族的反动势力。这些势力是日本天皇、旧的反动军阀、特权官僚、地主和垄断资本家，是那些剥削和鼓励剥削日本国民的人”。这些反动势力不是土地要遭到没收的地主，就是那些与地主利益相连的人。这个纲领强调指出：“使日本从占领制度下解放出来的道路上的第一个决定性的步骤”就是推翻这些反动势力，取消美国占领制度的支柱。
    右翼社会民主党人与“左”倾冒险家攻击我党关于农民的政策，硬说我们一点不了解农民的情况。他们硬说：由于战后在美国占领军统治下实行的
    “土地改革”的结果，土地已经在农民中间分配了；现在的问题是，在目前的情况下，农业无利可图，农业方面的投资极端不够。他们认为让森林继续留在政府手中是正确的。因此，他们的论点是：已经不再需要进行土地改革了。事实上，贫农与中农身上承担的不堪忍受的财政负担，正是这个假的“土地改革”的结果。农民已陷于必然要丧失土地的境地。现在，地主事实上正在恢复半封建的土地所有制。美帝国主义者与反民族的反动势力，利用封建残余，力图把农民变成他们的奴隶，把乡村变为主要的炮灰来源地。
    因此，右翼社会民主党人的观点是代表地主的利益的，在本质上与现政府的观点毫无分别。
    我们想要通过土地改革达到的目的是废除日本人民生活中各方面的封建残余，并在这个基础上发展农业，提高农民的生活水平。因此，这不单单是分配可耕地的问题，而且还包括山林、荒地、灌溉和其他农田事业以及义务缴纳农产品、赋税等问题。苏联、东欧国家和新中国都是生动的例子，说明在废除封建残余后，新的农村中的农民怎样在各方面表现出惊人的创造力，怎样大大地发展了农业生产。只有进行革命性的土地改革把地主的一切土地无代价地交给农民，才能达到这一步。
    山林地区对农业有着重大的关系，必须分配给农民。可耕种的地区必须开垦成为耕地。在那些可以改变成为草地与牧场的地区，应当进行改良工作。植树造林的工作应当由农民自己来进行，改革与灌溉工作应当由农民团体共同来做。
    只有当政府支持农民的努力，并给他们一切可能的援助的时候，才能够进行大规模的农业生产，并在这个基础上提高农民的生活水平。
    不实行这种革命性的土地改革，就不可能根本改善农民的境况。不实行这种改革，就不可能逐步地发展农业，因此，也就不可能改善工人阶级的生活和根本改变全体人民的生活。但是，不推翻日本的反动势力并改变国家制度，也就是说，不废除天皇制度并建立民主共和国，是不能达到这一步的。
    我们的纲领也明确地确定了关于工人阶级的问题的要求。这个纲领要求废除对劳工的半封建的剥削，给工人阶级的工会组织以自由，并认真地改善工人的物质条件。
    新纲领认为土地问题及废除农村中的封建关系有着重大的意义。因此，我们必须正确地确定农民的实际要求，并使这些要求得到实现。
    根据这一点，我党的纲领明确指出，只有依靠一个广泛的民族解放民主统一战线的力量，才能够实现这些任务，才能够在日本实现革命的民主改革，才能够实现民族解放民主革命。这个战线的基础就是工农联盟——日本人民解放斗争的主力。参加这个联盟的，还将有手工业者及小商人、中小工厂主，以及相当大一部分遭受占领制度与吉田政府的反动法律之害的工业家与商人。像山川之流的机会主义者主张只用工人阶级的力量进行革命，把农民的利益与地主和富农的利益同样看待，并撇开民族资本家不管。很明显，这样一种政策就是分裂人民，孤立工人阶级；这种政策是为帝国主义者与反民族的反动势力的利益服务的，其目的在绞杀革命。
    （四）在和平与民主的旗帜下
    在不久以前，我国争取独立、自由与和平的斗争还没有充分蓬勃地开展起来。在我国人民的某些阶层中，还有一些人这样地或那样地充当美国人的仆役。他们认为美帝国主义妄想称霸世界的政策非常强大，无法加以抵抗。但是，事实证明，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。在一九五○年十月中国人民志愿军出国援助朝鲜、以共产党为首的中国各民主党派宣布美帝国主义是一个纸老虎并且勇敢地起来与它进行斗争的时候，有许多人还不相信这一斗争会取得胜利。但是，朝鲜战争后来的发展过程清楚地说明了美帝国主义的孱弱性。
    东南亚各国人民与越南人民，仿效俄国的伟大十月社会主义革命和中国的人民革命的榜样，首先起来为反对帝国主义的干涉与争取独立而斗争。这一民族解放运动已经取得了任何帝国主义者都无法抹煞的胜利。它的影响已经扩大到近东和中东，也扩大到北非人民当中。在这些国家，解放斗争的声势之大，已达到空前未有的程度。很明显，美帝国主义妄图侵略以苏联为首的和平阵营的政策，甚至在资本主义的欧洲也遭到失败。美帝国主义者的所谓
    “援助”，其含义就是操纵接受援助的各国的经济，干涉它们的内政，把它们变为附属国，并且建立侵略和平阵营的“欧洲军”。目前，在一切这些国家中，财政体系和经济日趋破产，人民日趋贫困。结果，拒绝参加美帝国主义者的雇佣军队的倾向就表现出来了。因此，他们要建立巨大战争基地的计划显然也注定要遭受失败。
    自从伟大的十月社会主义革命成功、苏联诞生以来的整个历史过程都证明，和平的旗手、劳动人民的领袖与导师——约·维·斯大林所领导的苏联是一贯采取和平政策的。正是这一政策成为建立目前的世界范围和平阵营的基础。另一方面，我们都亲眼看到，美帝国主义者时时刻刻都在追求战争。就是在美国，老百姓也都知道，鼓吹世界霸权的垄断资本家及其政治走狗，只不过是一帮匪徒。结果，就造成这样的情况：不属于这一匪徒集团的人，如果不在联邦调查局的监督下向法西斯主义表示“忠诚”，就不能指望在国家机关中找到一个位置。现在，美国工人不顾资本家的命令和禁止罢工的法令，正在日益频繁地采取罢工行动，士兵日益丧失他们的战斗能力，普通公民也日益公开地对政府的政策表示不满。
    国际形势极清楚地说明了，国际和平阵营是我国民族解放民主战线的强大的同盟军。害怕占领军的恫吓，对所谓“自由世界”怀抱幻想，企图保持中立的地位——这在目前对我国是最有害不过的了。
    任何妄想依靠美帝国主义的企图都会为日本带来致命的灾难。希特勒、东条和墨索里尼过去的经验说明了这一点。
    人民中国的情况说明：在新的条件下，甚至资本家也能参加民族解放运动。因此，我国的资本家也必须改变他们的想法。
    如果我们松懈反抗美国占领军和吉田卖国政府的战斗精神，那么，镇压无疑会更加残酷。他们已经把确定了占领政策的波茨坦公告、开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定和远东委员会的决定都践踏在脚下了。他们进行了各种各样的活动，要想利用现在正在重新建立的日本武装部队参加朝鲜联合国军作战，而毫不顾及这些活动造成了生命财产的损失。他们拒绝赔偿飞机失事事件和不测的炸弹爆炸事故所造成的损失，更不要说日常的损失了。我们必须坚决地组织人民对日本的反动势力进行革命斗争，以推翻已经成为占领制度的精神上、政治上的支柱的吉田反动政府；我们必须对美帝国主义者的一切非法行动进行斗争。如果我们进行这种坚决的斗争，美帝国主义者就会被迫退却，而我们就会取得胜利。
    我们的纲领清楚地表明，它的基础就是为建立独立、民主与爱好和平的日本而斗争。这一斗争如果不与争取工人阶级、农民与全体人民的日常政治与经济要求之实现的斗争结合起来，就不会取得胜利。只有当这一斗争在工人与农民（他们构成日本人民的绝大多数）亲密联盟的基础上发展起来的时候，这个斗争才会取得胜利。
    日本各阶层人民的胜利斗争必须在这一联盟的基础上开展起来。这一点在知识分子所发出的要求为反对美国一手包办的单独“和”约和所谓“安全条约”而斗争的呼吁中，也获得了证明。
    我们坚决地拒绝毫不顾及工农利益的冒险家的欺骗政策。只有遵循纲领中规定的道路，我们才能完成我们的民族解放民主革命。
    日本共产党号召：首先是工人、农民与知识分子，其次是中小企业家和其他资本家都应该非常积极地参加民族解放民主统一战线，在和平与民主的旗帜下进行坚决的斗争。
