    Profiteers are the Enemy of the Entire Nation
    Zhu Xiying, Student of Peking University Medical College

    Our school is currently engaged in an intense anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. After returning from a rally, someone told me angrily: Li Yinting, a profiteer in Wuhan, used unsterilized, dirty cotton to make first-aid kits, poisoning our most beloved Volunteers. After finding the newspaper and reading this news, I was trembling with rage. We are medical students, and we know that in treating external wounds, the worst thing is to contaminate the wound. Because this not only causes the wound to fester and become inflamed, taking a long time to heal, increasing the suffering of the wounded and the rate of disability, but also risks the injured contracting tetanus or other malignant diseases, even sacrificing their lives. The profiteer Li Yinting using dirty cotton to make first-aid kits for the Volunteers to bandage wounds is like helping the American devils put poison on the bullets they use, and like helping the American devils add another shot to the wounds of our beloved Volunteers. Only a traitor who has completely lost his humanity could do such a thing!

    Our Volunteers are fighting in Korea. Even when they are wounded, they insist on killing more enemies; some wounded soldiers faint, and when they wake up, they shout: "Charge! Charge! Avenge the Korean people! Defend the people of the motherland!" The profiteers should also think: Who is protecting your mothers, wives, children, and property? Who is giving you a peaceful life?

    To support the Volunteers, people across the country, young and old, men and women, are doing their best. Take the treatment of wounded Volunteers, for example. Thousands of medical workers have gone to the front lines in Korea; nurses are rescuing the wounded under heavy fire; thousands upon thousands of people are donating their own blood to the wounded Volunteers; and some are even crying and wanting to cut off their own flesh to patch the wounds of their comrades. Millions of people take the pain of the wounded Volunteers as their own, eagerly hoping for their early recovery. But the profiteer Li Yinting and his ilk are secretly taking away the health of our most beloved people, taking away the lives of our most beloved people! This kind of profiteer is the most hateful person! They are the enemy of our entire nation!

    An atmosphere of anger enveloped everyone in our school. Students, teachers, doctors, and workers are all talking about this matter with hatred. The thrift inspection committee of our school received seventeen letters in one day. In these letters, all the students of three classes who remained at school and fifty-three other faculty and staff members angrily requested that the government be informed: severely punish the profiteers who secretly harm our most beloved people; request that the people of the whole country be informed: intensify the struggle against bribery and cutting corners a hundredfold, and fire together at "our most hateful people", thoroughly smashing the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks!

    奸商是全国人民的仇敌
    北京大学医学院学生　朱锡莹
    我们学校里正在紧张地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。开完大会回来，有人气愤地告诉我：武汉市奸商李寅廷，用没有消毒的脏棉花做成救急包，毒害我们最可爱的志愿军。找到报纸读完了这条消息，我气得浑身发抖。我们是学医的，我们知道，在处理外伤的时候，最怕的是把伤口弄脏。因为这样不但会使伤口化脓发炎，久不愈合，增加伤员的痛苦，增加残废率，还有使受伤者染上破伤风或其他恶性疾病，甚至牺牲性命的危险。奸商李寅廷用脏棉花来做志愿军用的救急包去包扎伤口，这等于帮美国鬼子在他们所使用的子弹上涂上一层毒药，也等于帮美国鬼子在我们亲爱的志愿军的伤口上再加上一枪。这种事只有完全失掉了人性的卖国贼才干得出来！
    我们的志愿军在朝鲜打仗，他们受了伤还坚持要多杀几个敌人；有的伤员昏过去了，醒过来就在高喊着：“冲啊！冲啊！为朝鲜人民报仇！保卫祖国人民！”奸商们也该想想：是谁在保卫着你们的母亲、妻子、儿女和财产？是谁给你们和平的生活？
    全国人民为了支援志愿军，老老少少、男男女女，都在尽自己的心，尽自己的力。就拿治疗志愿军伤员来说吧。成千的医务工作者走上了朝鲜前线；护理员们在炮火底下抢救伤员；成千成万的人抽出自己的鲜血献给志愿军伤员；还有人哭着要割下自己的皮肉给伤员同志补创口。千万人把志愿军伤员的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，眼巴巴地盼着他们早日恢复健康。可是奸商李寅廷之流却在暗地里夺去我们最可爱的人的健康，夺去我们最可爱的人的生命！这种奸商，是最可恨的人！是我们全国人民的仇敌！
    愤怒的心情笼罩了我们学校的每一个人。同学们、教师们、大夫们、工友们，都在恨恨地谈论着这件事。我们学校的节约检查委员会，一天之内收到了十七封信。在这些信里，有三个班的全体留校同学和其他五十三位师生员工，都愤愤地要求转告政府：加倍地严惩暗害我们最可爱的人的奸商；要求转告全国人民：百倍地加紧反行贿、反偷工减料的斗争，一齐向“我们最可恨的人”开火，彻底粉碎资产阶级的猖狂进攻！
