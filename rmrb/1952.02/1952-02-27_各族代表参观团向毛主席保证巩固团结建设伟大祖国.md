Respected Chairman Mao:

After the closing of the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Central Government organized a visiting group of representatives from thirty-one ethnic groups. From January 12th to 28th, we visited Tianjin, a light industrial city; Nanjing, famous for its historical sites; Hangzhou, with its beautiful scenery; and finally, Shanghai, the largest commercial port in our country. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed and received by the local people as if we were at home. In particular, leading officials personally received us and gave us valuable instructions. We felt as warm as orphans who had suffered for many years returning to the arms of their mother. This is because your wise leadership and great ethnic policies have made the people of all ethnic minorities in the country masters of the country, just like the Han people. We sincerely thank you and are determined to always unite closely under your banner, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and strive to build a great motherland of our own for all ethnic groups.

Through this visit, we deeply realized the greatness of the working class and the progress of the Han people. Workers use their wisdom to create inventions, improve technology, and increase production, not only completing production tasks but also exceeding them. They are creating amazing miracles everywhere. For example, workers in rubber factories created self-made car tires, and workers and engineers in chemical plants cooperated to create Chinese-made ammonium chloride. We can now make sulfuric acid ourselves. Their serious and tense work spirit and high degree of collectivity and discipline made us deeply realize that the working class is an advanced class. Secondly, in terms of politics, economy, culture, and military affairs, the facts we have seen are that the Han people are much more advanced than other ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, we have recognized a truth: as long as we unite with the Han elder brother and continue to move forward under the leadership of the working class, the beautiful and happy future of our ethnic groups is fully guaranteed.

After we return, in addition to earnestly implementing the spirit of the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, we will also bring the things we saw during the visit and the warmth of the great motherland—a big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups—to various ethnic minority areas for widespread publicity. In particular, we must resolutely implement your instruction to "increase production and practice strict economy," contribute all our strength to consolidate national defense and build the motherland, and repay you and the Central People's Government under your leadership for your concern for us.

With the most sublime revolutionary salute,
The Visiting Group of Ethnic Representatives of the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government

### 各族代表参观团向毛主席保证巩固团结建设伟大祖国

    各族代表参观团向毛主席保证巩固团结建设伟大祖国敬爱的毛主席：
    中央民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议闭幕后，中央又组织了有三十一个民族参加的各族代表参观团。我们从一月十二日至二十八日曾到轻工业都市——天津，富于名胜古迹的南京，风景美丽的杭州参观，最后参观了我国最大的商埠——上海。我们不论在那里，都像在家里一样，受到当地人民热烈地接待迎送；特别是每到一处，都有负责首长亲自接见我们，并给我们宝贵的指示。我们感觉恰如受好多年痛苦的孤儿，今天回到自己母亲的怀抱一样的温暖。这是因为您的英明领导和伟大的民族政策，使国内各少数民族人民和汉族人民同样都当了国家的主人。我们衷心地感激您，决心永远在您的旗帜下，在中央人民政府领导下，紧密地团结起来，为建设我们各族人民自己的伟大的祖国而奋斗。
    从这次参观当中，我们深刻地体会到工人阶级的伟大和汉族的进步。工人运用自己的智慧创造发明，改进了技术，提高了生产，不但完成了生产任务，而且超过了生产任务。他们到处创造着惊人的奇迹。例如橡胶厂工人创造了自造汽车轮胎，化学錏厂工人和工程师合作创造了中国制?臭镁，我们可以自造硫酸了。他们严肃紧张的工作精神和高度的集体性、纪律性，使我们深刻地认识了工人阶级是先进的阶级。其次，在政治、经济、文化、军事各方面，我们所看到的事实是汉族人民比国内其他民族进步的多。因此，我们认识了一个真理，只要和汉族大哥团结起来，在工人阶级的领导下，继续前进，我们各族人民美丽幸福的将来，是完全有保障的。
    我们回去后，除把中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议的精神认真贯彻以外，还要把参观的一些事物及伟大祖国——各民族友爱合作的大家庭的温暖，带到各个少数民族地区，广泛作宣传。特别要坚决执行您的指示“增加生产，厉行节约”，为巩固国防和建设祖国贡献一切力量，来报答您和您领导的中央人民政府对我们的关怀。致以最崇高的革命敬礼中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议各族代表参观团
