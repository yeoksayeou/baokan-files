    Denounce the Traitors of the Motherland - Unscrupulous Merchants Who Harmed the Volunteer Army
    The people of the whole country have expressed extreme indignation at the fact that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at the front in Korea has been harmed by illegal capitalists. People deeply know that their peaceful life is inseparable from the bloodshed and sacrifice of the Volunteer Army at the front in Korea. Everyone calls the Volunteer Army "the most beloved people" and feels honored to be able to serve the Volunteer Army; however, illegal capitalists do not hesitate to sacrifice the blood and lives of the Volunteer Army to achieve their despicable purpose of pursuing exorbitant profits. This shows the serious extent to which the illegal capitalists' attack on the motherland and the people has become rampant.
    If anyone wants to defend the crimes of these illegal capitalists, if anyone wants to put makeup on their ugly faces, then please open their eyes and look at these heartbreaking facts. The unscrupulous and insane illegal capitalists, as long as they can earn more money, they can do anything that hurts heaven and reason. They sell stinky beef and stinky eggs to the Volunteer Army as military rations, and even use dirty cotton picked from garbage to make first-aid kits to sell to the Volunteer Army. They disregard the health of the Volunteer Army and do things that make the enemy very happy. They have become traitors to the people of the motherland.
    The current facts prove that the bourgeoisie's rampant attack has reached the heads of the Volunteer Army. Do people still have any doubts about the corrupt nature of the bourgeoisie? Can we remain silent about the sinful behavior of illegal capitalists? Isn't it extremely necessary to give a resolute counterattack to the bourgeoisie's attack? If anyone has even a little bit of patriotism, then the demand to severely punish these conscienceless illegal capitalists is entirely justified.
    The current facts educate the people of the whole country to maintain a higher degree of vigilance against the bourgeoisie. Don't just see that capitalists have donated money when donating airplanes and cannons, but also know that some of them have stolen the wealth of the country and the people several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times more. Don't think that everyone loves the Volunteer Army, so there will be no problems in doing things for the Volunteer Army. No, in terms of the nature of the bourgeoisie, as long as there is a profit to be made, their rampant attacks will be all-pervasive. We suggest that all places across the country that have economic dealings with the Volunteer Army should conduct a thorough inspection in this movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. Thoroughly eliminate the moths who steal the property of the motherland and people to support the Volunteer Army and harm the Volunteer Army, so that every item of support from the people of the whole country to the Volunteer Army can fully exert its power. Resolutely break the poisonous cold arrows of unscrupulous capitalists who harm the Volunteer Army! Resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the motherland and the people!

    声讨祖国的叛徒——暗害志愿军的奸商
    全国人民对于在朝鲜前线的人民志愿军受到不法资本家暗害的事实表示了极度的愤慨。人们都深切地知道，自己的和平生活是和志愿军在朝鲜前线的流血牺牲分不开的，大家称呼志愿军是“我们最可爱的人”，并以能为志愿军服务而感到光荣；而不法资本家却不惜牺牲志愿军的鲜血和生命，来达到他们追求暴利的卑鄙目的。这说明不法资本家向祖国、向人民的进攻已经猖狂到怎样严重的程度。
    如果有人还要为这些不法资本家的罪行辩护，如果有人还要在他们丑恶的嘴脸上涂脂抹粉，那么，请他们睁开眼睛看一看这些令人痛心的事实吧。唯利是图、丧心病狂的不法资本家，他们只要能赚取更多的金钱，什么伤天害理的勾当也干得出来。他们把臭牛肉、臭蛋卖给志愿军当军粮，甚至把拾破烂来的脏棉花也拿来做救急包卖给志愿军，他们就是这样不管志愿军的健康，做着使敌人十分高兴的事情，他们已经变成了祖国人民的叛徒。
    当前的事实证明资产阶级的猖狂进攻已经打到志愿军的头上了，人们对于资产阶级腐朽的本质难道还有什么怀疑吗？对于不法资本家的这种罪恶行为难道还能够缄默吗？对于资产阶级的进攻给以坚决的反击难道还不是极端必要的吗？如果稍为有一点点爱国心的人，那么，要求重重地惩办这些丧尽天良的不法资本家无论如何是完全应该的了。
    当前的事实教育了全国人民，对于资产阶级要更高度地保持自己的警惕。不要只看到资本家在捐献飞机大炮的时候曾经出过钱，也应该知道在他们中间有的却几倍地、几十倍地、甚至几百倍地盗窃了国家和人民的财富。不要以为人人爱志愿军，就以为替志愿军办事情什么问题也不会发生。不是的，就资产阶级的本质说来，他们只要有利可图，他们的猖狂进攻就无孔不入。我们建议全国各地凡是和志愿军有经济往来的地方，在这次反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动中，都来作一次彻底的检查，彻底肃清盗窃祖国人民支援志愿军的财物、暗害志愿军的蟊贼，让全国人民支援志愿军的每一件东西都充分发挥它的力量。坚决折断不法资本家暗害志愿军的恶毒的冷箭！坚决打退资产阶级向祖国、向人民的猖狂进攻！
