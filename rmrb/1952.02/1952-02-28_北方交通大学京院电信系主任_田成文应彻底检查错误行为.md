To the Editor:

Tian Chengwen, the director of the Telecommunications Department of the Beijing Institute of Northern Jiaotong University, is both a professor and a businessman. He himself said, "I spend 30% of my time teaching and 70% doing business." Last year, the Ministry of Railways allocated public funds to our school to purchase new equipment. Director Tian Chengwen thought to himself, "The time to do business has come!" As soon as the funds arrived, he immediately took the money to Hong Kong to purchase equipment. Today, we understand that his wholehearted desire to go to Hong Kong was not to purchase equipment, but to contact his suspicious friends and classmates who remained there. While in Hong Kong, he stayed in a businessman's house, spending his days watching plays, playing cards, and sightseeing. Before returning, he shipped a batch of so-called "cheap goods" back from that businessman's store. In reality, these "cheap goods" were completely unusable. After returning, he put a batch of his own old and worn-out telecommunications equipment in a businessman's place, and then asked the school to purchase it from him at a high price. Tian's mistake is this serious, but in his self-criticism meeting, he lightly stated: "My thinking is 'water over soil moist,'" meaning that corruption is a matter of course and unavoidable.

Tian Chengwen's profit-seeking mentality is very strong. He would tell wealthy professors, "You have capital, and I have the means, let's go into business together." He also told the students, "We study engineering to make money." He told an assistant teacher, "If you help me, I will open a company in the future, and I will give you 1,000 catties of millet a month." This is how he spread the decadent ideology of the bourgeoisie to us. When he was in Hong Kong, he obsequiously asked a British capitalist to come to Beijing to open an electrical company, and let him be the manager of the company. These facts were exposed by everyone in the anti-corruption struggle. Tian Chengwen must deeply reflect, examine his thoughts, and correct his mistakes.

### 北方交通大学京院电信系主任  田成文应彻底检查错误行为

    北方交通大学京院电信系主任
    田成文应彻底检查错误行为
    编辑同志：北方交通大学京院电信系系主任田成文，又作教授，又作商人。他自己也说：“我是三分教书，七分做买卖。”去年中央铁道部拨了一笔公费给我校添置仪器，田成文主任心里就盘算着：“做买卖的时候到了！”经费一到手，他就立刻携款往香港购买仪器。今天我们才明白他一心一意要去香港，并不是为了购买仪器，而是为了去联系他那些留在香港的可疑的朋友和同学。在香港的时候，他住在一个商人家里，天天看戏打牌，游山玩水。临回来时，他从那个商人的店里运了一批所谓“便宜货”回来。事实上这批“便宜货”，根本是不能用的。回来后，他又把自己的一批破旧的电讯器材放到一个商人那里，然后叫学校以高价向他购买。田的错误是这样的严重，但是他在检讨会上，却轻描淡写地说：“我的思想是‘水过土湿’”，这句话的意思是：贪污是理所当然的，不可避免的。
    田成文的牟利思想是十分浓厚的。他遇到有钱的教授就说：“你有资本，我有办法，咱们一起做买卖去。”对同学们也说：“我们学工程就是为了赚钱。”他对助教说：“你帮我忙，将来我开一个公司，一个月我给你一千斤小米。”他就是这样向我们散播资产阶级的腐朽思想。他在香港的时候，曾经摇尾乞怜地要求一个英国资本家来北京开电气公司，让他担任公司的经理。这些事实在反贪污斗争中都被大家揭发出来了，田成文必须进行深刻反省，检讨自己的思想，改正错误。    森隽
