    (Thirteen) Liu Zhengming felt somewhat discouraged after being attacked with both hard and soft tactics by the manager and his uncle. He thought it was better to avoid trouble, and besides, there wasn't enough concrete evidence. All the way, he kept thinking about "unemployment" and "the family's reputation." Back at the counter, he saw Romance of the Three Kingdoms and thought of Guan Yu releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Pass. He planned to let Xu Rende off the hook this time, considering it a matter of loyalty.
    (Fourteen) Xu Rende breathed a sigh of relief when he saw his bad trick working, thinking that everything was completely arranged and secretly rejoicing in his heart.
    (Fifteen) That day, the shop's trade union held a shop employee representative meeting, and Liu Zhengming went too. He brought Romance of the Three Kingdoms, planning to read it during the meeting. At the entrance of the venue, he ran into a fellow shop employee, Xiao Ma, who was a member of the Communist Youth League and also a trade union cadre.

    （十三）刘正明受了经理和姑父的软硬夹攻，有些泄气。心想多一事不如少一事，再说真凭实据也不够。一路上尽想着“失业”，“亲戚面子”的问题。回到柜上看见三国演义，又想起华容道关公放曹操的事来了。他打算放徐仁德过这一关，也算是讲个义气吧。
    （十四）徐仁德一看他的坏招儿起了作用，也就松了一口气，以为这样就完全安排停当了，心里暗暗高兴。
    （十五）这一天店员工会召开店员代表大会，刘正明也去了。他拿着三国演义，准备开会的时候看。在会场门口，碰到了同行店员小马，小马是青年团员，也是工会干部。
