The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the direct command of Commander Chen Yi and the East China Military Region Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and since the leading launch from the East China Military Region level organs and troops stationed in Nanjing, the military regions and field armies of various provinces have responded one after another. Responsible leaders of various departments have mostly made self-criticism reports at mass meetings such as party representative conferences and soldiers' congresses, mobilizing and organizing the masses to join the struggle. Under the lead of the leaders, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers broke down their concerns, rose up to inspect the leadership, and exposed various phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

The East China Military Region Logistics and Health Department had more than 10 billion yuan worth of medicines and equipment in stock, which became ineffective due to long-term neglect and improper storage, while the vast number of soldiers lacked medicines. The Culture Department of the Political Department of the East China Military Region spent over 150 million yuan to purchase five pinball machines, and over 30 million yuan to buy several carpets, placing them in the "Culture Center" for the entertainment of a small number of people. In the past year, the department wasted 1.27 billion yuan in cultural expenses. Some senior cadres were also extravagant and wasteful in their daily lives. This adverse phenomenon, caused by the erosion of bourgeois ideology and work style, has been severely criticized by the masses. During the movement, all units confessed to their arbitrary use of "small public assets" and froze all assets pending instructions from higher authorities.

The masses have exposed a large number of corrupt elements dragged into the mud by the bourgeoisie, and many corrupt elements have also voluntarily confessed under the education of the Party and the masses. The materials already revealed prove that the bourgeoisie's offensive has caused serious losses to state property. In the East China Military Region Logistics and Supply Department alone, the losses suffered due to shoddy work and materials by unscrupulous merchants amounted to more than 30 billion yuan.

Currently, the East China Military Region level organs and troops stationed in Nanjing are about to concentrate their firepower to launch a fierce attack on major corrupt elements.

    华东军区和第三野战军普遍开展反贪污斗争
    军区一级机关和驻南京部队进入群众性坦白检举阶段
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，在陈毅司令员和中共华东军区党委的直接指挥下，并从华东军区一级机关和驻南京部队的带头发动以来，各省军区和野战军纷起响应。各部的负责首长大都已在党代表会议、军人大会等群众性的大会上作了检讨报告，动员和组织群众投入斗争。广大干部战士在首长的带头下，打破顾虑，奋起检查领导，揭发各种贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象。
    华东军区后勤卫生部库存价值一百亿元以上的药品器材，因长期无人过问，保管失当而失效，而广大战士却缺少医药。华东军区政治部文化部以一亿五千余万元的巨大代价购买弹子器具五台，以三千余万元买地毯数条，放在“文化馆”里供少数人娱乐。一年来，该部浪费的文化费即达十二亿七千余万元。若干高级干部在日常生活上也很铺张浪费。这种由于资产阶级思想作风的侵蚀而造成的恶劣现象，已受到群众的严厉批评。运动中各个单位都坦白了自己随意动用的“小公家”，并将资财全部冻结听候上级处理。
    群众检举了大批被资产阶级拖入泥坑的贪污分子，许多贪污分子也在党和群众的教育下自动坦白。已经揭发的材料证明，资产阶级的进攻已使国家财产遭到了严重的损失。仅华东军区后勤军需部一个单位，因被奸商偷工减料而蒙受的损失即达三百亿元以上。
    现在，华东军区一级机关和驻南京的部队即将集中火力向大贪污分子展开猛烈进攻。
