    The Criminal Activities of Deji Trading Company, Which Started by Stealing and Swindling National Assets
    Lin Hong

    In the Beijing private Deji Trading Company's office, there was a red piece of paper with the words "Patriotic Pact" written in black, one of which stated: "Study tax laws and tax payment procedures, so as to not evade taxes, not owe taxes, and pay taxes in advance." For Deji Trading Company, this was a false front and an irony. In fact, since the liberation of Beijing, this company has not only evaded huge amounts of taxes, but also used all kinds of despicable means to seduce, win over, and corrupt state workers, and colluded with unscrupulous merchants who infiltrated state-owned enterprises to embezzle and steal large amounts of state assets.

    Deji Trading Company opened in 1947. According to the company's general manager, the unscrupulous merchant Qiao Kejun, he admitted that in the early days of the liberation of Beijing, he had little capital and only some scattered materials; in reality, "Deji Trading Company" had become an empty signboard. The unscrupulous merchant Qiao Kejun had worked as a clerk during the Japanese puppet regime in Northeast China and had dealings with some private merchants; some of these private merchants had infiltrated state-owned enterprises after the liberation of Northeast China. Qiao Kejun believed that he had an opportunity to make a fortune. In April 1949, he impersonated a merchant and, through his improper relationship with certain cadres of the Northeast State-owned Lumber Mill, transported two truckloads of timber from Shenyang. Later, he bribed and won over cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the state-owned North China Construction Company, selling this batch of timber at high prices and obtaining a large amount of illegal profits. Thus, at the end of 1949, Deji Trading Company reopened, specializing in the timber business. By the beginning of 1950, the total capital had increased to 500 million yuan. Qiao Kejun owned 60 percent of the capital and served as the general manager; in order to jointly engage in malfeasance and corruption, he promoted Zhang Zhiwen (who had been a secretary to Wang Qiaomin, a major special agent in Northeast China) to manager, and Zhang Yunfeng (Qiao Kejun's brother-in-law, who had long served as a plainclothes agent in the Tianjin puppet police station before liberation) as deputy manager. These few unscrupulous merchants went to Northeast China many times, using some degenerates or "moles" who had infiltrated state-owned enterprises to steal state railway cars to transport timber for them. According to what the Beijing Municipal Economy and Thrift Inspection Committee inspection team has already verified and what these unscrupulous merchants have admitted, in the past three years, they illegally used 143 railway cars, transporting a large amount of timber and obtaining illegal profits of more than 2.9 billion yuan.

    As early as November and December 1949, private merchants from Beijing Beihua Enterprise Company went to Northeast China to purchase and transport timber for the warehouse of a state-owned clothing factory in the suburbs of Beijing. Deji Trading Company colluded with Yuan Shiwei of this private company and used extremely vile fraudulent means to add a "0" after the number of board feet of timber written in the introduction letter of this warehouse, thus requesting more railway cars to transport their own timber. Zhang Yunfeng, the deputy manager of Deji Trading Company, even impersonated an employee of Beihua Enterprise Company to negotiate for railway cars with the Northeast Railway Bureau. In reality, the warehouse of a certain state-owned clothing factory only used three railway cars, while Beihua Enterprise Company stole seven or eight railway cars, and Deji Trading Company stole 18 railway cars. Both of these unscrupulous merchants obtained a large amount of illegal profits as a result.

    In addition to using this fraudulent means, these unscrupulous merchants of Deji Trading Company also tried every means to buy off and corrupt state workers. Thirty-seven managers, factory directors, and cadres of several state-owned lumber mills and enterprise units in Northeast China were dragged into the water under their enticement and corruption; some of these people were "moles" sent in by the bourgeoisie. The amount of money they directly or indirectly accepted in bribes totaled more than 600 million yuan.

    The methods used by the unscrupulous merchants Qiao Kejun, Zhang Yunfeng, and Zhang Zhiwen to seduce, buy off, and corrupt state workers were varied. In order to obtain advance payment for speculative activities while delaying delivery, they colluded with Shi Donglu, an employee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. When the manager of Deji Trading Company learned that Shi Donglu's mother had died, he immediately sent him 500,000 yuan. The most vicious thing was that these unscrupulous merchants often looked for the weaknesses of certain state workers and launched fierce attacks on them. For example, Xu Zhenqi, an employee of the North China Construction Company, liked to drink, so the unscrupulous merchants of Deji Trading Company specially invited him to drink, getting him drunk twice and going to prostitutes together. In the face of the sugar-coated bullets of the unscrupulous merchants, these weak-willed state workers fell into the mire. Qiao Kejun once invited Song Degui and Xiao Shunhe, major embezzlers of the Central Public Security Department, to eat at "Yuhuatai," stroll in the park, take photos together, and even watch a play together in the evening. After these unscrupulous merchants dragged the cadres into the water, they boldly used various "relationships" to carry out the criminal activities of stealing state assets. The time they illegally stole the most state railway cars was when they colluded with these embezzlers to do it together.

    This incident of stealing a large number of state railway cars occurred at the beginning of 1951. At that time, Deji Trading Company purchased a batch of timber in Northeast China, which could not be transported into the customs as a private merchant. Therefore, the unscrupulous merchants of Deji colluded with Yu Xihe, the manager of the state-owned Northeast May 1st Lumber Mill, asking him to find a way to find railway cars on their behalf. Yu Xihe was an embezzler who had long colluded with Zhang Yunfeng of Deji and others, accepted bribes, and even went to brothels together. Therefore, he accepted this request. The method was that Deji sold the 800 cubic meters of timber he had purchased in Northeast China to the May 1st Lumber Mill at the original price of 600,000 yuan per cubic meter. At that time, if sold at the market price of timber in Shenyang, Yu Xihe could obtain illegal profits of more than 480 million yuan from these 800 cubic meters of timber. This act of Deji was actually a disguised form of bribery to Yu Xihe. Therefore, Yu Xihe, in the name of the May 1st Lumber Mill, called Beijing and colluded with the embezzlers of the Central Public Security Department, and illegally stole 60 railway cars from units such as the Central Public Security Cadre School and the Hengyang Railway Administration for the unscrupulous merchants of Deji and other companies to transport timber into the customs. Among them, 48 railway cars were loaded with timber from Deji, enabling this company to obtain illegal profits of more than 970 million yuan. These unscrupulous merchants colluded with embezzlers in this way to carry out the criminal act of stealing state assets.

    The unscrupulous merchants of Deji Trading Company also colluded with Li Deqing, an unscrupulous merchant who infiltrated the state-owned Donggong Lumber Mill as manager, by means of bribery, asking for 19 railway cars in the name of a certain engineering school for Deji, and at the same time asking for 17 railway cars for Li Deqing's brother to transport their timber.

    In the past three years, Deji Trading Company has also repeatedly engaged in illegal merchant activities, falsely reporting expenses, forging documents, and evading a large amount of state taxes; and privately trafficking in gold. According to what has now been verified, this company has underreported its income and turnover by more than 2.1 billion yuan in total, and privately purchased more than 300 taels of gold from Northeast China and other places. In order to win over and buy off employees, the unscrupulous merchants Qiao Kejun and others also absorbed some people who were closer to them to participate in these illegal activities, and after making money, they distributed some "hush money" to each employee.

    After the Beijing Municipal organs and people from all walks of life launched a vigorous campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the unscrupulous merchants Qiao Kejun, Zhang Yunfeng, and others were guilty and afraid, actively making arrangements among the employees on the one hand, and destroying evidence on the other hand, and concluding an "offensive and defensive alliance" with the cadres who accepted bribes, attempting to sabotage the frank confession movement. They actively suppressed the clerks from reporting, and convened four meetings of all employees within ten days to feel out the "bottom line" of the employees. They also sent people to follow and monitor some employees when they went to the trade union to attend meetings. In addition to the above methods, they also took the method of dispersing property, depositing more than 90 taels of gold in the homes of several shareholders and merchants. When the inspection team went to inspect, these unscrupulous merchants refused to confess, and the employees also claimed that they did not know. These unscrupulous merchants thought that their illegal activities would not be discovered, and at first, they did not care at all. In particular, Zhang Yunfeng, the deputy manager who presided over the illegal activities such as stealing railway cars, pretended to be serious. However, because the inspection team had already grasped the materials and patiently explained the policies to the employees of this company, raising their class consciousness, some employees exposed their crimes. In the face of ironclad facts, these unscrupulous merchants had to bow their heads and confess, admitting some of their illegal facts. The Beijing Municipal Economy and Thrift Inspection Committee has decided, based on the criminal facts of these unscrupulous merchants and the extent of their confession, to recommend to the Municipal People's Government that they be given due punishment.

    靠盗骗国家资财起家的德记贸易行的罪恶活动  
    林洪
    在北京私营德记贸易行的办事室里，贴着一张红纸上写着黑字的“爱国公约”，上面有一条写的是：“学习税法及纳税手续，做到不漏税，不欠税，并提前纳税。”对于德记贸易行来说，这是一个虚假的幌子，也是一个讽刺。事实上，这个商行自北京解放以来不但偷漏了巨额的税款，而且用尽各种卑鄙无耻的手段，来引诱、拉拢和腐蚀国家工作人员，并和钻进公营企业的奸商共同舞弊，盗骗了大量的国家资财。
    德记贸易行是在一九四七年开业的，据这个商行的总经理奸商乔可均自己供认，他在北京解放的初期已经没有什么资金，只有一些零星的物资；实际上“德记贸易行”已经成为一块空招牌了。奸商乔可均在东北日伪统治时期作过职员，和一些私商有过往来；这些私商有的在东北解放后混进了公营企业。乔可均就认为有了发财的机会。一九四九年四月，他就假冒行商名义，通过他和东北公营制材厂某些干部的不正当关系，从沈阳运来两车木材。后又以行贿的方式收买拉拢石景山钢铁厂和公营华北建筑公司的干部，用高价把这批木材出售，获得大量非法利润。于是，在一九四九年底，德记贸易行便重新开张，专门经营木材生意。到一九五○年初，资本总额便增加到五亿元。乔可均占有资本的百分之六十，由他担任总经理；他为了共同营私舞弊，并把张之闻（当过东北大特务头子王洽民的秘书）提升为经理，用张云峰（乔可均的妹夫，解放前曾长期在天津伪警察局充任便衣特务）为副经理。这几个奸商，多次到东北，利用一些蜕化分子或混进国营企业的“坐探”，盗用国家车皮，替他们运输木材。根据北京市节约检查委员会检查组已查明的和这些奸商所承认的，三年来他们非法盗用了一百四十三个车皮，运输了大批木材，获得非法利润二十九亿元以上。
    早在一九四九年十一、二月，北京北华企业公司的私商，到东北替京郊某国营被服厂仓库购运木材。德记贸易行便和这个私营公司的袁世伟共同作弊，用极其恶劣的欺诈手段，在这个仓库的介绍信中所写的木材板尺数字的后面加上了一个“O”，这样就多要了车皮来运输他们自己的木材。德记贸易行的副经理张云峰，还冒充北华企业公司职员的名义，到东北铁路总局交涉车皮。实际上国营某被服厂仓库仅用了三个车皮，而北华企业公司就盗用了七、八个车皮，德记贸易行盗用了十八个车皮。这两家奸商都因此得到大量非法利润。
    德记贸易行的这些奸商，除了利用这种欺诈的手段以外，还想尽各种办法来收买和腐蚀国家工作人员。东北有好几家公营制材厂的经理、厂长和几个企业单位的干部三十七人，在他们的利诱腐蚀下，被拖下了水；其中有些人就是资产阶级派进来的“坐探”。这些人直接间接受贿的款项计达六亿多元。
    奸商乔可均、张云峰和张之闻等人，引诱、收买和腐蚀国家工作人员的办法是多种多样的。他为了能够先期取得货款作投机活动，而延期不交货，便勾引了石景山钢铁厂的职员史东鲁。德记贸易行的经理探知史东鲁的母亲病死，便马上送给他五十万元。最毒辣的是，这些奸商们常常寻找某些国家工作人员的弱点，向他们展开猛烈的进攻。例如华北建筑公司的职员徐振启喜好喝酒，德记贸易行的奸商便特别请他喝酒，两次把他灌醉了，共同去嫖妓女。在奸商们的糖衣炮弹之前，这些意志薄弱的国家工作人员便陷入了泥坑。乔可均曾请中央公安部的大贪污犯宋德贵和萧顺和等人，到“雨花台”吃饭，一起逛公园、照相，晚上还一起看戏。这些奸商把干部拉下水以后，便大胆地利用各种“关系”干着盗骗国家资财的罪恶活动。他们非法盗用国家车皮最多的一次，就是勾结这些贪污分子一起干出来的。
    这件大量盗用国家车皮的事件发生在一九五一年初。当时德记贸易行在东北购买了一批木材，用私商名义无法运进关内。于是德记的奸商便和公营东北五一制材厂的经理于锡河互相串通，请他设法代找车皮。于锡河是一个贪污分子，早已和德记的张云峰等有勾结，接受过贿赂，并且还一起去逛过妓院。因此他便接受了这个请求。办法是德记将他在东北所购得的八百立方公尺木材，按原价每立方公尺六十万元卖给五一制材厂。当时按沈阳市木材市价出售，于锡河便可以从这八百立方公尺木材中取得非法利润四亿八千多万元。德记的这一行为实际上是对于锡河的一种变相行贿。因此，于锡河以五一制材厂的名义，打电话到北京，和中央公安部的贪污分子勾结，并替德记等商行的奸商非法盗用了中央公安干部学校和衡阳铁路管理局等单位的车皮六十个，替他们运木材进关。其中有四十八个车皮都是装的德记的木材，使这个商行获得非法利润九亿七千多万元。这些奸商就是这样和贪污分子串通进行着盗窃国家资财的罪恶勾当。
    德记贸易行这些奸商，还以行贿的方法，勾结了混进公营东工制材厂作经理的奸商李德庆，以某工兵学校的名义替德记要车皮十九个，同时给李德庆的弟弟要了十七个，来运输他们的木材。
    德记贸易行三年来，还屡次非法进行行商活动，虚报开支，伪造单据，偷漏了大量国家税款；并私自贩运黄金。据现已查明的，这个商行共漏报所得额和营业额二十一亿多元，私自从东北等地购得黄金三百多两。奸商乔可均等为了拉拢和收买职工，还吸收某些和他们较接近的人参加了这些违法活动，而且赚了钱以后，给每一个职工也多少分一些“堵嘴钱”。
    北京市各机关和各界人民大张旗鼓地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，奸商乔可均、张云峰等做贼心虚，一面在职工中积极布置，一面毁灭证据，和受贿干部订立“攻守同盟”，妄图破坏坦白检举运动。他们积极压制店员检举，十天之内召开了四次全体职工会议，来摸职工的“底”。有的职工到工会开会时，他们也派人跟上监视。他们除上述办法外，还采取了分散财产的办法，把黄金九十多两存在几个股东和行商的家中。当检查组去检查时，这几个奸商都拒不坦白，职工们也推说不知道。这些奸商以为自己的违法行为不会被检查出来，起初都满不在乎。特别是主持盗用车皮等违法活动最多的副经理张云峰，更是假装正经。但是由于检查组早已掌握了材料，而且耐心地向这个商行的职工讲明了政策，提高了他们的阶级觉悟，因而有些职工便揭发了他们的罪行。在铁一般的事实面前，这几个奸商才不得不低头认罪，承认了自己的一些犯法事实。北京市节约检查委员会，已决定根据这几个奸商的犯罪事实和他们坦白的程度，建议市人民政府给予他们以应得的处分。
