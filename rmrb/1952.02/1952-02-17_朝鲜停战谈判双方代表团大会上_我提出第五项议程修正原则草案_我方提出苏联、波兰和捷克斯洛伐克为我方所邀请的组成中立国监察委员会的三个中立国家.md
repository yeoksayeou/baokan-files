Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th - To swiftly reach a reasonable resolution to the fifth agenda item in the Korean armistice negotiations, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation proposed the following revised draft principles at the plenary session of both delegations on the 16th: "To ensure a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the military commanders of both sides hereby suggest to the relevant governments of both sides that, within three months after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, representatives be dispatched to convene a higher-level political conference of both sides to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question."

At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, our side proposed the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia as the three neutral nations invited by our side to form the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The neutral countries proposed by the other side were Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway. Our side formally suggested that both sides simultaneously express agreement to the neutral countries proposed by the other side, but the other side unreasonably opposed inviting the Soviet Union to send representatives as neutral supervisory commissioners. Our side pointed out that the other side had no reason to oppose any of the neutral countries proposed by our side and demanded that the other side provide a response after careful consideration. Our staff also solemnly pointed out at the meeting on the 16th that our side had already proposed a completely sufficient and reasonable plan for resolving the third agenda item. Whether the third agenda item can be quickly agreed upon will depend entirely on the attitude of the other side.

At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, when discussing our side's draft of February 14th, the other side insisted on using ambiguous and vague wording, unwilling to adopt a reasonable attitude to resolve the issue, and used various methods to maintain and adhere to its untenable so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle. Our staff pointed out that the other side must make efforts to address all the issues in the fourth agenda item that need to be resolved currently, otherwise the meeting will fall into a lengthy debate without any results.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我提出第五项议程修正原则草案
    我方提出苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克为我方所邀请的组成中立国监察委员会的三个中立国家
    【新华社开城十六日电】为了迅速达成朝鲜停战谈判中第五项议程的合理解决，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团在十六日的双方代表团大会上，提出以下修正原则草案：“为保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，双方军事司令官兹向双方有关各国政府建议在停战协定签字并生效后三个月内，分派代表召开双方高一级的政治会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题”。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，我方提出了苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克为我方所邀请的组成中立国监察委员会的三个中立国家。对方提出的中立国家为瑞士、瑞典、挪威。我方正式建议双方同时对于另一方所提出的中立国家表示同意，但对方毫无理由地反对邀请苏联派遣代表作为中立国监察委员。我方指出对方没有任何理由反对我方所提出的中立国中任何一国，要求对方在慎重考虑后再作答复。我方参谋人员在十六日的会上并郑重指出我方已经提出了解决第三项议程的完全充分而合理的方案。第三项议程是否能够迅速达成协议，将完全有视于对方的态度。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，对方在讨论我方二月十四日的草案时，主张要用模棱两可的含糊措词，而不愿采取合理的态度解决问题，并且用种种方法来维护并坚持其早已站不住的所谓“自愿遣送”的原则。我方参谋人员指出对方必须面对当前应当解决的第四项议程中所有的问题来作努力，否则会议将陷入长期的争论，而得不到任何结果。
