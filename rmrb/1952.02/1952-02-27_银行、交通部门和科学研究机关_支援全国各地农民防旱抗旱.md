    Banks, Transportation Departments, and Scientific Research Institutions
    Support Farmers Nationwide in Drought Prevention and Resistance

    Following the call by the Central People's Government to launch a drought prevention and resistance campaign, the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have taken measures to support farmers nationwide in drought prevention and resistance. The Head Office of the People's Bank of China has instructed its branches throughout the country to closely coordinate with local drought prevention and resistance efforts, to promptly issue loans related to drought prevention and resistance, and to strengthen the business of issuing short-term drought prevention loans. The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government has instructed transportation departments throughout the country to vigorously support drought prevention and resistance work in highway and inland river transportation. All transportation enterprises and units must proactively establish close contact with local or nearby drought prevention and resistance leadership organizations, assist them in solving transportation difficulties, prioritize the transportation of drought prevention and resistance personnel and supplies, ensure the completion of tasks within the prescribed time limit, and avoid delaying agricultural work. Local transportation departments and transportation enterprises and units must also make all preparations for organizing mass transportation, so as not to be caught unprepared when urgent tasks arrive. The Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a symposium on drought prevention and resistance on the 23rd of this month. At the meeting, Vice President Li Siguang proposed the idea of developing well irrigation on the North China Plain. Staff members from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Geological Work Steering Committee of the Central Government also attended the meeting. Everyone agreed that shallow well irrigation is simple and easy to implement and has a significant role in drought prevention and resistance, and it should be vigorously promoted. However, farmers should also be organized to dig deep-water wells. This work can first select drilling locations, make typical demonstrations to gain experience, and then promote it, in order to lay the foundation for fundamentally solving the drought problem in areas outside the scope of river and canal irrigation in the future.

    银行、交通部门和科学研究机关
    支援全国各地农民防旱抗旱
    中央人民政府号召开展防旱、抗旱运动后，中国人民银行、中央人民政府交通部和中国科学院已采取了一些措施，来支持全国农民的防旱和抗旱。中国人民银行总行已指示全国各区分行，密切配合当地的防旱、抗旱工作，及时发放和防旱、抗旱有关的贷款，加强发放短期防旱贷款的业务。中央人民政府交通部已指示全国各地交通部门，应在公路和内河运输上，大力支持防旱、抗旱工作。各运输企业单位必须主动地和当地或附近地区的防旱、抗旱领导机构取得密切联系，协助其解决运输上的困难问题，优先地运送防旱、抗旱工作人员和供应品，保证限期完成任务，不误农时。各地交通部门和运输企业单位并须做好组织群众运输的一切准备工作，以免紧张任务到来时措手不及。中国科学院在本月二十三日召开了一次防旱、抗旱座谈会。会上，李四光副院长提出了发展华北大平原水井灌溉的意见。参加这个会的还有中央农业部和地质工作指导委员会等机关的工作人员，大家都认为浅井灌溉简便易行，在防旱、抗旱上的作用大，可大力推行，但也应该组织农民打深层水井。这个工作可先选定开凿地点，作典型示范取得经验后再推广，以为将来根本解决河渠灌溉范围以外地区的干旱问题打下基础。    （新华社）
