    The Soviet Union is Our Most Sincere Friend
    Zhang Ming, Head of the Mechanized Farming Team, Yongnian State Farm

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, allow me to extend warm congratulations to the Soviet people.

    The Soviet people are the most sincere friends of the Chinese people. Over the past two years, the Soviet Union has given us tremendous assistance in our construction endeavors. This has greatly promoted the rapid development of our country's construction work.

    I am the head of the mechanized farming team of the Yongnian State Farm. Every time I use various new-style tractors and new farm implements from the Soviet Union and see the achievements of our farm, I think of our most sincere Soviet friends, because the achievements we have obtained are inseparable from the help of our Soviet allies. I remember that when this farm was established in 1949, we only had a few small American tractors. The machine power was too small, only pulling two ploughshares, and could not plough deeper than four inches in the wasteland, and could not even remove the weeds, so the crops did not grow well. At that time, I had a wrong doubt about mechanical farming: I felt that it could not solve big problems.

    After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we shipped a large number of tractors from the Soviet Union. These machines are all tracked and have more than 50 horsepower; in addition, a large number of new machines, such as seeders and harvesters, also arrived. After our farm used these Soviet machines, production efficiency was greatly improved and costs were reduced. Soviet machines have opened up a broad road for the development of our farm. We have established confidence: to learn the advanced agricultural science and technology of the Soviet Union well, so that our country's agriculture will gradually move towards collectivization.

    Over the past two years, our farm has learned from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union, and has thus achieved great results. In terms of working methods, we have changed the previous single-implement operation (a large machine only towed one harrow, resulting in low work efficiency and high cost), and adopted the advanced Soviet combined operation, with each Natzi tractor towing three round harrows, or three seeders, giving full play to the effectiveness of the machines, so the work results have been significantly improved. For example, harrowing has increased from 20 mu per hour to 45 mu, and ploughing has increased from 6 mu per hour to 12 mu. Costs have also been reduced, with harrowing reduced from 0.6 kg per mu to 0.3 kg, and ploughing reduced from 2.1 kg per mu to 1.2 kg; the quality has also met the standards. In 1950, ploughing was not done with small ploughs, and the work of turning the soil was not done well, and the grass could not be covered; in 1951, all were equipped with small ploughs, and as a result, the soil was turned very finely, increasing the weeding and agricultural effect of the cultivated land. At the same time, because the system of maintenance and inspection of machines was well implemented in 1951, the machines rarely broke down during the year, ensuring the promotion of regular work. Therefore, the harvest of our farm in 1951 increased compared with the previous year.

    But we are not satisfied with the achievements we have achieved. Now, for the complete victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and for the new victory of the country's large-scale economic construction, we are working hard to study the advanced experience of Soviet state farms, to produce more grain and save more capital for our motherland.

    We sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its internationalist assistance to us. For the bright future of all mankind, let the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union unite more closely and move forward!

### 苏联是我们最真诚的朋友

    苏联是我们最真诚的朋友
    国营永年农场机耕队长  张铭
    值兹中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年纪念日，让我向苏联人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    苏联人民是中国人民的最真诚的朋友。两年来，在我国建设事业上，苏联给予了我们以极大的帮助。这大大地促进了我国建设工作的飞跃发展。
    我是中国国营永年农场机耕队的队长。每当我使用各种来自苏联的新式拖拉机、新农具和看到我们农场的工作成绩时，我便会想起我们最真诚的苏联朋友，因为我们所获得的成绩是和苏联盟友的帮助分不开的。我记得，当一九四九年间建立这个农场的时候，我们只有几部美国的小拖拉机，机器力量太小，只拉两个铧，在荒地里耕不到四寸深，连草也除不了，因此庄稼长得不好。当时我对机械耕种发生了一种错误的疑虑：觉得它不能解决大问题。
    在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以后，我们从苏联运来了大批的拖拉机，这些机器都是炼轨式的，有五十多匹马力；此外，还来了大批的新机器，如播种机和收割机等等。我们农场使用了这些苏联的机器以后，生产效率大大提高，成本减低。苏联机器为我们农场的发展开辟了广阔的道路。我们树立了信心：要好好地学习苏联的先进农业科学和技术，使我国农业逐步走向集体化。
    两年来，我们的农场学习了苏联的先进生产经验，从而得到了很大的成绩。在工作方法上，我们改变了以前的单农具作业（一部大机器只拖一个耙，结果工作效率低而成本高），采用了苏联先进的联结作业，每部纳齐拖拉机拖三台圆式耙，或三台播种机，充分发挥了机器的效能，因而工作成绩有显著的提高。例如：耙地由每小时二十亩提高到四十五亩，耕地由每小时六亩提高到十二亩。成本也降低了，耙地每亩由○·六公斤降到○·三公斤，耕地每亩由二·一公斤降到一·二公斤；在质量上也达到了标准。一九五○年耕地没有用小犁，翻土的工作做得不好，草掩覆不住；一九五一年则全部装了小犁，结果土翻得很碎，增加了耕地的灭草和农业作用。同时，因为一九五一年很好地执行了对于机器的保养和检查制度，一年中机器很少出故障，保证了经常工作的推进。因此，一九五一年我们农场的收成比上年增加了。
    但是我们还不满足于我们所达到的成绩。现在为了抗美援朝的彻底胜利，为了国家大规模经济建设的新的胜利，我们正在努力研究苏联国营农场的先进经验，为我们的祖国增产更多的粮食和节约更多的资财。
    我们衷心地感谢苏联对我们的国际主义的帮助。为着全人类的美好的将来，让中苏两大民族更紧密地团结起来向前迈进！
