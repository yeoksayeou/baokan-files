    The Leadership of Siping City Cotton Company Should Immediately Correct Serious Right-Leaning Ideology

    The serious right-leaning ideology demonstrated by the leadership of the Siping City Cotton Company in Liaoxi Province during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement must be immediately corrected.

    Since Comrade Zhou Jian, Secretary of the Siping City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report on "Tiger Hunting" on February 4th, the leadership of the Siping City Cotton Company has taken no action for more than twenty days. On February 14th, Manager Zhai Ze said: "If I were to sign and stamp, I can guarantee that there are no major corrupt elements!" This shows how serious the right-leaning ideology of the leadership is. Hao Yanrong, the factory director of a factory affiliated with the company, had some clues of corruption during his tenure as the manager of the Yixian Department Store. When the masses raised this at the meeting, the leadership actually obstructed it, saying: "It cannot be mentioned at the meeting. If it is mentioned, wouldn't it lose the prestige of the leadership?..." When Comrade Shi Xianzhang requested the approval of the Thrift Examination Committee to investigate the materials regarding Yu Fengtong, Hao Yanrong refused to allow the investigation. The masses, fearing "wearing small shoes," directly reported their opinions to the Municipal Party Committee. Li Yanrong, the head of the personnel section, threatened Comrade Zhao Shiqian after learning about it, saying: "You are actually putting labels on the leadership, you will be responsible for all the consequences." He also said: "If you keep rectifying like this, you can lead the movement!" Hao Yanrong also approached Zhao Shiqian and said:

    "Who is your mastermind!..." Due to the leadership's ideological paralysis and weakness, corrupt elements deliberately played tricks, and the struggle yielded no results. There were also problems with the composition of the Thrift Examination Committee, even Yu Fengtong, who had unclean hands, participated in the committee. Although the leadership felt "surprised" when the masses revealed Yu Fengtong's problems one by one, they still allowed Yu Fengtong to go to Shenyang for "investigation work" because Yu Fengtong was "active in his work." This also shows the seriousness of the leadership's right-leaning ideology.

    I hope the relevant leadership will inspect the movement of the Siping City Cotton Company.

### 四平市棉花公司领导方面  应立即纠正严重的右倾思想

    四平市棉花公司领导方面
    应立即纠正严重的右倾思想
    辽西四平市棉花公司领导方面，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中表现的严重的右倾思想，须立即纠正。
    自二月四日中共四平市委员会书记周健同志作了关于“打虎”的报告后，二十多天以来，四平市棉花公司领导方面一直都没有行动起来。二月十四日翟泽经理曾说：“如果让签字盖章，我就敢保证没有大贪污分子！”这可以说明领导方面的右倾思想是多么严重。该公司所属某工厂厂长郝彦荣，在义县百货公司经理任内有一些贪污线索，当群众在会上提出时，领导方面竟阻挠说：“不能在会上提。如果提了，不是丧失了领导上的威信吗？……”当石显章同志请求节约检查委员会批准他去调查关于于风桐的材料时，郝彦荣竟不让去调查。群众怕“穿小鞋”，把意见直接反映给市委。人事股股长李彦荣知道后，便威胁赵世钱同志说：“你们竟给领导上扣帽子，一切后果由你们负责。”又说：“你们这样整，运动就由你们领导吧！”郝彦荣也找赵世钱说：
    “你们的主谋是谁呀！……”由于领导思想的麻痹、软弱，贪污分子故意耍花招，斗争没有什么结果。节约检查委员会的成份也有问题，连手脚不干净的于风桐也参加了委员会。当群众把于风桐的问题一一揭发后，领导方面虽然感到了“惊讶”，但因为于风桐“工作积极”，仍然让于风桐去沈阳作
    “调查工作”。这也可以说明领导思想右倾的严重。
    我希望有关领导方面，来检查一次四平市棉花公司的运动情况。
