During the Fourth Campaign, I led a platoon to defend Height 559. Height 559 and Height 579.2 were like a pair of iron fists, tightly gripping the throat of the highway from Hengcheng directly to Hongchuan. Our platoon defended for seventeen days and nights, finally completing the task of blocking the enemy, killing and wounding more than two hundred of them.

On March 6, 1951, just as dawn broke, enemy planes and artillery shells fiercely bombarded our hilltop. I estimated that the enemy would launch a major offensive today. Sure enough, in a short while, two squads of enemies climbed up the hillside. I told the soldiers to remain calm. When the enemy got close, our grenades and heavy machine guns launched a dense attack, leaving few enemies able to escape back. Then, we repelled three more enemy assaults in a row.

After repelling the enemy's fourth assault, we didn't have much ammunition left. At this time, enemy activity was discovered on the back mountain. I immediately told everyone:

"Treat a stone as a grenade." I also sent a communication soldier to inspect the back mountain and sent two soldiers to monitor the left and right hilltops. Just as the arrangements were completed, "Boom!" A shell landed next to me, and I immediately fainted. At this time, the enemy launched a fifth assault. Just when things were critical, cook Lao Yu came up carrying a box of grenades, and I also regained some consciousness. I touched my head and it was sticky with blood, but I didn't forget our blocking mission. I quickly picked up a few grenades and fought the enemy. At this time, it looked like the enemy was about to rush up. Four comrades with minor injuries also jumped up to join the battle. One soldier, with a wounded right arm, used his left arm to throw grenades. I shouted as I fought: "Comrades, fight resolutely! Avenge the wounded and sacrificed brothers!" The soldiers' gun barrels turned red, and their arms swelled from throwing, but no one relaxed. The enemy's fiercest assault was finally beaten back by us. (Attached picture)

    孙荣昌谈光荣完成阻击任务
    第四次战役时，我带了一个排坚守在五五九高地上。五五九高地和五七九·二高地好像一对铁拳，紧紧地扼住了从横城直通洪川公路的咽喉。我们一个排坚守了十七个昼夜，终于完成了阻击敌人的任务，一共杀伤敌人二百多。
    一九五一年三月六日，天刚亮，敌人的飞机、炮弹就向我们的山头猛轰。我估计今天敌人一定有大进攻。果然，一会儿，山腰里有两班敌人爬上来了。我让战士们沉住气。等到敌人爬近时，我们的手榴弹和重机枪就密集的向敌人一阵猛击，没剩下几个敌人能逃回去。接着，我们又一连打退了敌人的三次冲锋。
    打退了敌人第四次冲锋后，我们的弹药剩得不多了。这时后山又发现了敌情。我就马上告诉大家：
    “一块石头要当一颗手榴弹使。”我又派一个通讯员到后山去视察，并派二个战士监视左右山岗。刚刚布置好，“轰”的一声，一颗炮弹落在我的身旁，我立刻昏过去了。这时敌人又发起了第五次冲锋。正在紧急的时候，炊事员老于扛着一箱手榴弹上来了，我也有些清醒了，用手一摸，脑袋黏糊糊的满是血，但是我没有忘记我们的阻击任务。我就迅速拿起几颗手榴弹和敌人拚开了。这时，眼看着敌人就要冲上来了。四个负轻伤的同志也都跳起来参加了战斗。有一个战士右臂负了伤，就用左臂扔手榴弹。我边打边喊：“同志们坚决打呵！给负伤牺牲的兄弟们报仇呵！”战士们的枪筒打红了，胳臂扔肿了，但没有一个人放松。敌人的最凶一次冲锋终于又被我们打下去了。（附图片）
