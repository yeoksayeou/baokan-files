    Hoover has long been known as one of the most violent agitators for American aggressive policy. With close ties to the largest financial monopolies, Hoover is an ambitious figure representing the most reactionary and aggressive elements of the American ruling class.
    From this speech, it can be seen that Hoover criticized Truman's foreign policy. This is not accidental. It is well known that due to the crisis in American aggressive policy and the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people with this policy, the struggle within the American ruling class is intensifying. The presidential election to be held at the end of 1952 has sparked campaign disputes, making the spokesmen of various opposing groups more candid.
    Hoover's speech includes two parts.
    In the first part, he criticized the Truman government's foreign policy, attempting to prove that this policy is unrealistic and thus leads to failure. In the second part, Hoover explained his own program, attempting to prove that his program is realistic and is the way for America to be saved.
    The part of Hoover's speech that criticizes the current American government's policy is not without credibility, because Hoover relies on facts here.
    What are those facts?
    Hoover mentioned the promises loudly proclaimed by the agitators of the aggressive plan to establish a "European Army" and their calculations for France, Britain, Germany, and other countries to establish divisions. But in Hoover's words, "Apart from the American and British divisions, it is difficult to find ten combat-ready divisions in the Western European armies today." How is this obvious disparity explained? Hoover asked, "What exactly happened?" In answering, Hoover mentioned certain facts and figures. These facts and figures show that many wishful calculations have shamefully gone bankrupt. Whether in quantity or quality, the plan has not been completed. America's European allies are unable to complete these plans, and they are encountering increasing new difficulties.
    Hoover also said, "Today, there is not the same kind of social panic in Europe as has been stirred up in America. None of these countries have declared a state of emergency or taken measures comparable to ours. They do not promote the war panic or stir up war psychology that we see in Washington. No European country is conducting bomb drills like the ones we are conducting in New York."
    Hoover thus had to admit an undeniable fact: American politicians attempted to stir up the atmosphere of war hysteria and atomic mania in Western Europe that they had already stirred up in America, but this attempt was destined to fail. Why did this fail in Western Europe? Why did the billions of dollars spent on war propaganda, spent on buying off Western European governments, reactionary political parties, newspapers, and radio stations, disappear without a trace as if swallowed by a bottomless pit?
    In Hoover's words, the reason is: the people of Western European countries do not believe that the Soviet Union has aggressive intentions. But here, Hoover mentioned what "Europeans" said: "In the past five years, the Russian army has been able to sweep across Europe in two months of war at any time, and will undoubtedly be able to do so in the coming years." But, as everyone knows, they have not done so, and the people of Western European countries are not worried that the "Russian army" will do so. Experience has shown that the people of Western European countries judge the Soviet Union and its policies not based on the slander of the war-mongering camp, but based on facts and the Soviet Union's actions. The Soviet Union has no aggressive ambitions and is waging an unwavering struggle to maintain and strengthen peace.
    Hoover not only talked about the situation in Europe, but also repeatedly talked about Asia and the Middle East. He said, "In South Asia and the Middle East, we see great changes in political power," and that the nationalist forces in Asia have "ignited a prairie fire of revolution against the West," and by "the West" he means the colonial countries. Naturally, Hoover is after all Hoover—he attempts to attribute this situation to the conspiracy of the "Kremlin with its eyes turned to the East," but he himself does not believe his own words and has to admit that America's policy calculations in Asia have also seriously gone bankrupt.
    Hoover criticized the American government on the Korean issue. He acted as a spokesman for General MacArthur, who suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea, and as a spokesman for this person who advocated launching a war against the Korean people and the Chinese people. According to Hoover, because MacArthur's bandit-like plan to attack China was not accepted, "we (referring to the United States) ourselves gave up the opportunity for victory," although it is clear from Hoover's speech that he actually never had a plan to achieve victory in Korea, and he does not have such a plan now. The fact remains that the United States has suffered defeat both militarily and diplomatically in the war imposed on the Korean people, and the responsibility for the war lies with the American government and MacArthur's spokesmen.
    Finally, Hoover also acknowledged the undeniable fact that America's current aggressive policy has caused "seriously damaging inflation" domestically, threatening the domestic economy, bringing a heavy tax burden to the people, and contributing to rising prices and a decline in the living standards of the working people. He said: "The prominent phenomenon in the United States now is that our massive spending is dangerously oppressing our economy... The American people have not yet felt the full consequences of the government's staggering increase in spending and taxation. However, we have already felt the pain of seriously damaging inflation and heavy taxes. We are in effect in a wartime economy, only without a worldwide war breaking out. We are increasingly shifting civilian production to the production of war materials. We are gradually putting more manpower into the military."
    Hoover went on to talk about the situation that the United States might encounter in the future. He said: "The living standards of millions of our families will decline. Another millions of families will have to spend their historical savings. Rising prices will first affect the kitchen, and taxes will strike our families from the door. These huge taxes will also exhaust our economy."
    It would be naive to expect Hoover to describe in detail the suffering that the American people have suffered from the arms expansion movement. However, if even people like Hoover start talking about the crisis of American policy, then it is obvious how alarmed the broad masses of the American people are.
    What Hoover is talking about now, such as saying that America's current policy is unrealistic, that this policy is constantly encountering new failures, and that it is likely to encounter more failures, are not new discoveries. Many American problem observers have long talked about the crisis of American policy, and he is just repeating what they have said.
    Hoover is not only limited to criticism. He also said that he has his own plan.
    No matter how great Hoover's aggressive ambitions are, no matter how hard he tries to support the most aggressive pro-MacArthur military group in the United States, he has to issue warnings, pointing out the dangers of America's current policy, and has to think of other ways to accomplish the aggressive plans of American imperialism.
    Hoover can give beautiful speeches, saying that the current Western Hemisphere (the United States) is the "last Gibraltar for maintaining freedom." But he immediately explained how he understood the task of this "last Gibraltar for maintaining freedom," saying: "Ground forces are the sole problem of Europe itself," and that Western European countries should be responsible for organizing ground forces, and the United States should be responsible for building air and naval forces. Since this is the case, according to Hoover's plan, in the future world war, Western European countries should provide what is usually called "cannon fodder," while the American government, in order to reduce its own expenditure, will only provide air and naval forces and will not send ground forces to Europe.
    People have heard of such military plans before, and have heard of the same method of allocating military tasks. However, everyone knows that such plans and interrelationships are unique plans and relationships of colonial countries for their dependent colonies. Now, the American ruling class is shamelessly talking about such plans, the targets of which are those European countries that have degenerated to the point of being dependent on American imperialism. We do not need to speculate on what lessons Western European countries will draw from this situation.
    At the same time, in the passage where Hoover presented his own plan, there were also expressions of unease. He was forced to say: "The only way to save Europe from destruction is to avoid a third world war." He also said: "Our relationship with the United Nations Charter must be corrected." What he meant by this was to warn the American ruling class not to be enthusiastic about war adventures—carrying out such war adventures under the banner of the United Nations has recently become a habit.
    This warning is not accidental. Hoover and those who are currently manipulating the American government are equally imperialists. He continues to openly express support for the American militarist group with the greatest aggressive ambitions. In his speech, Hoover also put forward a plan, which, although not in the same form as the familiar military plans of the American government, is still a plan to launch another world war.
    Nevertheless, Hoover was forced to issue warnings, saying that preparations for a third world war should not be stepped up, and pointed out to the American people the dangerous consequences of the policies currently being implemented by the United States.
    If even a political leader like Hoover is forced to issue such warnings repeatedly, then this shows that the American people are increasingly deeply disgusted with the American aggressive policy that demonstrates the mad ambition of imperialist hegemony in the world.

    胡佛和美国政府的如意算盘的破产
    ——苏联真理报二月二日社论
    胡佛很久以来就以美国侵略政策最狂暴的鼓动者之一闻名。胡佛与最大的金融垄断企业有密切关系，他是代表美国统治集团的最反动、最富侵略性的野心勃勃的人物。
    从这篇演说中可以看到，胡佛批评了杜鲁门的外交政策。这不是偶然的。大家知道，由于美国侵略政策遇到危机，由于广大人民群众对这一政策日益不满，美国统治集团内部的斗争正在日益尖锐化。即将在一九五二年年底举行的总统选举，引起了竞选斗争的争吵，使各敌对集团的代言人都变得坦率起来。
    胡佛的演说包括两部分。
    在第一部分中，他批评了杜鲁门政府的外交政策，企图证明这一政策不合乎现实，因而招致失败。在第二部分中，胡佛说明了他自己的纲领，企图证明他的纲领是合乎现实的，是美国得救之道。
    胡佛的演说中批评美国现政府的政策的那一部分不无可信之处，因为胡佛在这里根据的是事实。
    那些事实呢？
    胡佛提到建立“欧洲军”的侵略计划的鼓动者大肆宣传的诺言与他们要法国、英国、德国及其他国家建立师团的算盘。但是用这位胡佛的话来说，“除了美国和英国的师团外，今天在西欧军队中很难找到十个能打仗的师团”。这种显明的悬殊怎样解释呢？胡佛问道：“究竟发生了什么事情呢？”胡佛在回答时提到某些事实和数字。这些事实与数字说明，许多如意算盘都可耻地破产了。不论在数量上或质量上，计划都没有完成。美国的欧洲盟国都无力完成这些计划，它们遭到与日俱增的新的困难。
    胡佛又说：“今天在欧洲没有像在美国所煽起的那种社会恐慌。这些国家没有一个宣布紧急状态，或采取可与我们相比的措施。他们不宣传我们在华盛顿所看到的战争恐慌或煽起战争心理。没有一个欧洲国家进行我们在纽约所进行的防备炸弹的演习。”
    胡佛就这样不得不承认一个无法驳倒的事实：美国政客企图在西欧煽起他们在美国已经煽起的战争歇斯底里和原子狂的气氛，但是这一企图的命运却归于失败。为什么这在西欧失败了呢？为什么花在战争宣传上面，花在收买西欧政府、反动政党、报刊和电台上面的几百亿美元，都无影无踪像被无底洞吞没了一样呢？
    用胡佛的话说，原因是：西欧各国人民不相信苏联有侵略意图。但是，在这里，胡佛提到“欧洲人士”所说的话：“在过去五年中，俄国陆军随时都能在两个月的战争中席卷欧洲，而且在今后几年中，无疑也能做到这一步。”但是，大家知道，它们并没有这样做，西欧各国人民也并不担心“俄国陆军”会这样做。经验证明，西欧各国人民不是根据战争贩子阵营的诽谤之言，而是根据事实和苏联的行动，来判断苏联和它的政策的。苏联是毫无侵略野心的，它正在进行坚持不渝的斗争来保持与加强和平。
    胡佛不仅仅谈到欧洲的局势，他还一再谈到亚洲与中东。他说，“在南亚与中东，我们看到政治力量的大变动”，亚洲的民族主义力量已经“燃起了反对西方的革命的燎原之火”，而他所谓的“西方”是指殖民国家。自然，胡佛毕竟是胡佛——他企图把这种局势归咎于“眼睛转向东方的克里姆林”的阴谋，但是，他自己也不相信自己的话，而且不得不承认美国在亚洲的政策的盘算也严重地破产了。
    胡佛在朝鲜问题上批评美国政府。他替在朝鲜遭到惨败的麦克阿瑟将军充当代言人，替这个主张对朝鲜人民和中国人民发动战争的人充当代言人。据胡佛说，由于麦克阿瑟主张攻击中国的强盗式计划没有被接受，“我们（指美国）便自己放弃了胜利的机会”，虽然从胡佛的谈话中可以清楚地看到，他实际上并不曾有过在朝鲜取得胜利的计划，而且现在也没有这样的计划。事实仍然是：美国在强加于朝鲜人民的战争中，无论在军事方面和外交方面都遭到了失败，战争责任在于美国政府和麦克阿瑟的代言人。
    最后，胡佛也承认了这样一个无可否认的事实，就是美国目前的侵略政策已在国内造成了“为害严重的通货膨胀”，威胁了国内的经济，给人民带来了沉重的赋税负担，促成了物价上涨和劳动人民生活水准的下降。他说：“美国现在突出的现象就是，我们庞大的开支危险地压迫着我们的经济……美国人民至今还没有感受到政府开支和税收惊人增加的全部后果。然而，我们已经感受到为害严重的通货膨胀和苛捐杂税的痛苦。我们实际上已处于战时经济之中，只不过还没有爆发全世界的战争罢了。我们愈来愈是把民用生产转移到战争物资的生产上去。我们渐渐把更大量的人力投到军队里去。”
    胡佛接着谈到美国将来可能遇到的境况。他说：“我们成百万个家庭的生活水准将要下降。另外成百万个家庭将不得不花掉历来的积蓄。物价上涨首先要影响厨房，赋税将从大门袭入我们的家庭。这些巨额的税收还将要使我们的经济陷于枯竭。”
    要希望胡佛能够详尽地描写扩张军备运动使美国人民遭受到的痛苦的情况，那是幼稚的幻想。然而，假如像胡佛这样的人也开始谈论美国政策的危机，那么美国广大人民是怎样惊恐，就是显而易见的了。
    胡佛现在所谈的，诸如说美国目前的政策不现实啦，这个政策不断地遭到新的失败啦，很可能还会遭到更多失败啦，这些都不是什么新发现。许多美国问题观察家老早就谈到了美国政策的危机，他不过是重述一遍他们说过的话而已。
    胡佛还不单止于批评。他还说，他自己有一套计划。
    不管胡佛有多大的侵略野心，不管他怎样竭力希望支持美国最富侵略性的拥护麦克阿瑟的军事集团，他不得不发出警告，指出美国目前政策的危险，不得不想其他的办法来完成美帝国主义的侵略计划。
    胡佛是会讲漂亮话的，他说，现在的西半球（美国）是“维护自由的最后的直布罗陀”。可是他立刻就解释了他是怎样理解这个“维护自由的最后的直布罗陀”的任务的，他说：“地面部队是欧洲本身的唯一问题”，又说，西欧国家应该负责组织地面部队，美国应该负责建设空军和海军。既然如此，照胡佛的计划说来，在将来的世界大战中，西欧国家就应该出通常叫作“炮灰”的那种东西，而美国政府为了减少自己的支出，就要只出空军和海军，不派地面部队到欧洲去了。
    人们从前也听到过这样的军事计划，也听到过同样的分配军事任务的方法，可是，大家知道，这样的计划和相互关系，正是殖民主义国家对于附属于它们的殖民地的特有的计划和关系。现在，美国统治集团已经在恬不知耻地谈论这样的打算了，这种打算的对象，是那些堕落到依附美国帝国主义的地步的欧洲国家。对于西欧国家会从这种情况中得出什么教训，我们是不必加以揣测的。
    同时，在胡佛发表他自己的计划的那段话里，还有着不安的表示。他迫不得已地说：“挽救欧洲脱离毁灭的唯一办法，就是避免第三次世界大战。”他又说：“我们与联合国宪章之间的关系，必须加以改正。”他这话就是在警告美国统治集团，告诉他们不要热中于战争冒险——在联合国的旗帜下进行这种战争冒险，近来已经成为惯例了。
    这种警告并不是偶然的。胡佛和现在操纵美国政府的那些人，同样是帝国主义者。他继续公开表示支持侵略野心最大的美国军国主义集团。胡佛在演说中，也提出了一个计划，这种计划固然在形式上不和人们所熟悉的美国政府的军事计划相同，但仍然是发动另一次世界大战的计划。
    虽然如此，胡佛仍然迫不得已地提出了警告，说不可加紧准备第三次世界大战，并向美国人民指出了美国现在所执行的政策的危险后果。
    如果连胡佛这样的政治领袖也迫不得已地屡次发出这样的警告，那么，这就表明：美国人民对于表现了帝国主义称霸世界的疯狂野心的美国侵略政策，已经是越来越深恶痛绝了。
