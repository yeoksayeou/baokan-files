The cases of seven major embezzlers, including Xue Kunshan, have been concluded after trial by this Court. The main text of the judgments against each of these major embezzlers is now announced as follows:

Xue Kunshan

The major embezzler Xue Kunshan, a member of the bourgeoisie, seized the opportunity to infiltrate our state-owned trading agencies and served as Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Animal Products Company. The defendant Xue used his position to steal national economic intelligence, serving his privately run fur store, seriously disrupting the state-owned trade acquisition work, extracting large amounts of state assets, and embezzling and encroaching upon public funds when jointly operating the Fuyihe Fur Shop with the public, engaging in speculation and profiteering for personal gain. The defendant's crimes, committed before and after, caused enormous losses to the state. It has now been ascertained that his existing illegal gains amount to more than 2.3 billion yuan, and his crimes are extremely serious. He is sentenced to death and all his property is confiscated. Other defendants in the same case will be tried separately.

Song Degui

The major embezzler Song Degui, formerly the Director of the Administrative Department of the Ministry of Public Security, abused his authority, violated laws and regulations, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, embezzled a large amount of state assets amounting to more than 900 million yuan, and embezzled 640 million yuan for personal gain, and refused to confess. His crimes are extremely serious. He is sentenced to death and all his property is confiscated. Other defendants in the same case will be tried separately.

Lei Yaqing

The major embezzler Lei Yaqing, formerly the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Supply Station of the State-owned Farms of the Ministry of Agriculture, abused his authority, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, and embezzled and accepted bribes amounting to 147 million yuan, causing losses to state property of more than 400 million yuan. After being discovered, he still refused to make a thorough confession. He is sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, and all赃款 (spoils) are to be recovered. Other defendants in the same case will be tried separately.

Sun Jianguo

The major embezzler Sun Jianguo, formerly the Deputy Director of the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, was lured by unscrupulous merchants, colluded in smuggling, embezzled and accepted bribes amounting to 127 million yuan, and introduced unscrupulous merchants into the national production institutions, causing significant losses to state property. He should have been severely punished, but considering that the defendant Sun fully, automatically, and thoroughly confessed during this struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and helped the People's Government expose unscrupulous merchants, he is given a lenient sentence of ten years of imprisonment, with a suspended sentence to observe future behavior; and all his spoils are to be recovered. Other defendants in the same case will be tried separately.

Wang Piye

The major embezzler Wang Piye, formerly an engineer in the Barracks Management Department of the Air Force Logistics Department, abused his authority and embezzled and accepted bribes amounting to 252.75 million yuan, causing significant losses to state property. The defendant Wang was forced to confess only after his crimes were discovered. Considering that his confession was relatively thorough and that he was able to atone for his crimes by reporting that unscrupulous merchants stole state assets by skimping on materials in contracted projects amounting to more than 8 billion yuan, he is sentenced to five years of imprisonment, with a suspended sentence to observe future behavior, and all his spoils are to be recovered. Other defendants in the same case will be tried separately.

Xia Maoru

The major embezzler Xia Maoru, an engineer and head of the engineering section of the Central South Region Grain Administration, abused his authority, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, and embezzled and accepted bribes amounting to more than 120 million yuan, causing significant losses to state property. However, after the start of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, he voluntarily confessed and repented, and actively reported other corrupt criminals in many cases, rendering meritorious service in the movement. He is exempted from criminal punishment. The embezzled and accepted bribes, excluding those that have been returned, should be recovered. The relevant authorities should give him administrative punishment. Other defendants in the same case will be tried separately.

Hang Xiaozu

The major embezzler Hang Xiaozu, the chief engineer and director of the Telecommunications Factory of the Civil Aviation Administration, embezzled 17,500 Hong Kong dollars in salaries for employees when he defected, and also embezzled a steel wire recorder. He made a preliminary confession during the rectification movement in 1951, and sincerely repented during this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and guaranteed to return all the spoils to the state. Over the past year, Hang Xiaozu has made some technical creations and inventions with the intention of atoning for his crimes. Therefore, Hang Xiaozu is exempted from criminal punishment, and the relevant authorities will give him administrative punishment.
