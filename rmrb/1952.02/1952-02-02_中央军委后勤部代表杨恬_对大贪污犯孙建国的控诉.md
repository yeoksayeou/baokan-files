Central Military Commission Logistics Department Representative Yang Tian's
Accusation Against the Major Embezzler Sun Jianguo

I accuse the embezzler and bribe taker Sun Jianguo.

Sun Jianguo is from Hebei, of peasant origin, joined the army in 1938, and joined the Party in 1942. He served in the People's Liberation Army as deputy propaganda team leader, cultural instructor, acting instructor, reconnaissance and communications staff officer, battalion commander, and regimental chief of staff.

During the Liaoyang Campaign in Northeast China in 1948, he was shot in the intestines by the Kuomintang bandit army and severely wounded. After rescue and treatment, he became disabled and could no longer serve in the army. The superiors decided that Sun Jianguo should go to the local area for long-term recuperation.

In January 1949, Sun Jianguo met businessman Wang Ling while recuperating and jointly opened Dazhong Oil Workshop. From then on, Sun Jianguo was surrounded by businessmen who used methods such as inviting him to the theater and patronizing prostitutes to drag him into the water. Initially, Sun Jianguo firmly refused. However, the businessmen's methods were malicious and despicable. They studied Sun Jianguo's thoughts and formulated countermeasures, flattering Sun Jianguo on the one hand, and eroding Sun Jianguo ideologically on the other, saying, "Revolutionary soldiers, especially veteran cadres like you, should live a hard life in order to be models for the masses. But your health is so bad, how can you go on like this? Your intestines have been grafted with dog intestines, and who knows when they will break and take your life. Now that the revolution has been won, wouldn't it be a waste to die without enjoying some blessings!" This poisonous arrow struck Sun Jianguo, captured him ideologically, and further captured Sun Jianguo in terms of life enjoyment by inviting him to dinner, baths, movies, female waitresses, dance halls, and prostitutes. After Sun Jianguo was completely captured by the businessmen, they proposed that Sun Jianguo come forward to engage in smuggling, trafficking iron from Anshan to Tianjin. From then on, Sun Jianguo completely became a businessman, betrayed the Communist Party, betrayed the proletariat, betrayed the People's Army, betrayed the people, and became a criminal who stole state property.

From May 1949 to 1950, Sun Jianguo stole 900 tons of pig iron, earning more than 5.2 billion Northeast currency. Later, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau discovered and arrested him, confiscated his 5 billion yuan, and advised him to be law-abiding. After this failure, Sun Jianguo arrived in Tianjin in October 1950. However, after arriving in Tianjin, he was immediately surrounded by the奸商(cunning merchant) Li Xiaozhi. Li Xiaozhi sacrificed his position as the business director of the Wujin Native Products Trading Company in order to use Sun Jianguo, following Sun Jianguo every day, and introduced Sun Jianguo to the Tianjin Linji Foreign Firm as an associate, signing a one-year contract, stating that Sun Jianguo could use the name of Linji Foreign Firm externally, use the telephone, and work in the Linji Foreign Firm, and stipulating that the proceeds of the transaction would be divided according to a 40/60 split, with Sun Jianguo getting 40% and Linji Foreign Firm getting 60%. The奸商(cunning merchant) Li Xiaozhi received a 10% commission from both Linji and Sun Jianguo. From then on, Sun Jianguo completely became a heinous and powerful henchman of the Linji Foreign Firm.

At the end of 1950, the General Logistics Camp Management Department needed asphalt oil. Sun Jianguo and Li Xiaozhi and two others jointly decided to sell 1,000 tons of asphalt oil to the Camp Management Department, but in reality, they only delivered less than 700 tons. Sun Jianguo received a commission of 25 million yuan from this. In 1951, Sun Jianguo was introduced to work in the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department as deputy director, but Sun Jianguo concealed his secret relationship with the Linji Foreign Firm. Surrounded by many奸商(cunning merchant), Sun Jianguo took advantage of the situation where the front needed cars at that time and introduced the sale of 100 trucks to the Supply Department, stipulating that the goods would be delivered in two months, but the goods were still not delivered after two months, causing a loss of 2.3 billion yuan to the public (insurance, interest, fines, etc.), while Sun Jianguo received a commission of 150 million yuan for introducing this batch of cars. Later, because the cars did not arrive, the money was returned, but he earned 2 million yuan in interest. In another purchase of 400,000 sacks, Sun Jianguo received a commission of 60 million yuan. In the transaction of 200 tons of rubber, Sun Ji received 20 million in the name of borrowing 20 million from co-businessman Liu Guosheng.

Summarizing the above-mentioned crimes, Sun Jianguo voluntarily separated from the Party and organization in January 1949. In the two years and four months before arriving at the Supply Department in April 1951, in addition to the 5 billion Northeast currency that had been confiscated by the Shenyang Public Security Bureau, he stole state property worth 45 million yuan in RMB; in the eight months at the Supply Department, he embezzled and took bribes of 82 million yuan, totaling 127 million yuan. Of this money, more than 20 million yuan was spent, and 99.5 million yuan was invested in stores in Tianjin and Beijing.

Sun Jianguo is such a big embezzler. He caused serious losses to the country and should be severely punished, but considering that at the beginning of the movement, he confessed his crimes relatively sincerely and reported the奸商(cunning merchant) and other embezzlers he knew, and expressed his willingness to sincerely repent and make amends, I request the Supreme People's Court to impose a lighter sentence to clarify the law and discipline, and to give him a chance to atone for his crimes. At the same time, it also points out to those big embezzlers that only by thoroughly confessing can they find a way out and receive the government's leniency.

    中央军委后勤部代表杨恬  
    对大贪污犯孙建国的控诉
    我控告贪污受贿分子孙建国。
    孙建国河北人，贫农成份，一九三八年入伍，一九四二年入党，在人民解放军中历任团宣传副队长，文化教员，代理指导员，侦察通讯参谋、营长、团参谋长等职。
    在一九四八年东北辽阳战役时，他被国民党匪军打断了肠子，负了重伤，经营救治疗成为残废，不能继续在部队服务，上级决定孙建国到地方上长期休养。
    一九四九年一月，孙建国在休养时结识了商人王龄，合开了大众油房。从此孙建国即为商人包围，以请看戏、嫖妓女等方法拖他下水，开始孙建国坚予拒绝。但商人的办法是恶毒的，卑鄙的，他们研究孙建国的思想定出对策，一面极力奉承孙建国，
    一面从思想上腐蚀孙建国，说“革命军人，特别像你这样的老干部，生活上应该很艰苦，这样才能成为群众的模范。但是你的身体这样坏，这样下去怎能行呢？你的肠子接了狗肠子，说不定什么时候断了，就要你的命，现在革命胜利了，再不享点福，死了才冤枉呢！”这一支毒箭射中了孙建国，从思想上俘掳了孙建国，再进一步以请吃饭、洗澡、看戏、吃女招待、进跳舞厅、嫖妓女，在生活享受上俘掳了孙建国。当孙建国完全被商人俘掳之后，商人便提出了要孙建国出面走私，从鞍山贩铁到天津，从此孙建国完全变成了商人，背叛了共产党，背叛了无产阶级，背叛了人民军队，背叛了人民，而成为窃取国家资财的罪犯。
    从一九四九年五月以后到一九五○年，孙建国盗买生铁九百吨，共得五十二亿余元东北币，后为沈阳市人民政府公安局发觉逮捕，没收了他的五十亿元，劝他安分守己。孙建国在这次失败之后，于一九五○年十月到了天津。但到天津后又立即为奸商李孝直所包围。李孝直为利用孙建国而牺牲了他所担任的武进土产贸易行业务主任的职务，每天追随孙建国左右，寸步不离，并将孙建国介绍给天津临记洋行担任了协理，订了一年的合同，说明孙建国可以对外用临记洋行的名义，可以使用电话，可以在临记洋行办公，并规定成交所得照四六分红，孙建国得四成，临记洋行得六成。奸商李孝直则从临记与孙建国处各得一成佣金，孙建国从此就完全变成了罪大恶极的临记洋行的得力狗腿子了。
    一九五○年底，总后勤营管部需要沥青油，孙建国即与李孝直等三人合伙商定卖给营管部一千吨沥青油，但实际只交了不足七百吨，孙建国从中分得了佣金二千五百万元。一九五一年，孙建国经介绍到总后勤部供应处工作，任副主任，但孙建国隐瞒了与临记洋行的秘密关系。在许多奸商包围下，孙建国利用了当时前方需汽车的情况介绍卖给供应处一百部卡车，规定两月交货，但过期两月货仍未到，使公家遭受了二十三亿元的损失（兵险费、利息、罚金等），而孙建国在介绍这批车时分得了一亿五千万元佣金，后因车没到将钱退了，但得了二百万元的利息。在另一次购买四十万条麻袋中，孙建国又分得了佣金六千万元。在成交二百吨橡胶中，孙以借跑合商人刘国胜二千万元名义得了二千万元。
    总括以上所举罪行，孙建国在一九四九年一月自动脱离党、脱离组织，到一九五一年四月到供应处前的两年四个月中，除已为沈阳公安局没收五十亿元东北币外，窃取国家资财合人民币四千五百万元；到供应处的八个月中又贪污受贿八千二百万元，总计一亿二千七百万元。这些钱除用掉了二千余万元外，还有九千九百五十万，分别投资在天津、北京商店。
    孙建国就是这样的一个大贪污分子。他给了国家以严重损失，应该受到严厉惩处，但念其在运动开始时，即比较诚恳坦白地交待了自己一切罪恶行为，检举了他所知道的奸商和其它贪污分子，并且表示愿意真诚地悔过，戴罪立功。因此，我请求最高人民法院从轻处刑，以明法纪，并给以立功赎罪的机会。同时，也向那些大贪污分子指出，只有彻底坦白，才能找到生路，才能得到政府的宽大。
