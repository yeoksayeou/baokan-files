    At the People's Liberation Army Lhasa Clinic
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Shenying
    In Lhasa, where there are no hospitals or modern medical equipment, the People's Liberation Army in Tibet has established a relatively complete clinic for the Tibetan people.
    For the past month, the Tibetan people of Lhasa have been spreading the good news: "Go to the People's Liberation Army clinic to see a doctor, it doesn't cost a penny, and it's very effective. The diseases that we have not been able to cure for many years can now be cured." There are often many people on the streets watching the vaccination advertisement posted by the clinic. As they watch, they give a thumbs up and praise: "The People's Liberation Army is thinking of us in every way."
    The spacious courtyard of the clinic is crowded with Tibetan people seeking medical treatment every day. There are women wearing red and green clothing, and lamas draped in dark red robes. They all wait patiently in order to register, go to the vaccination room for vaccination, or go to the dermatology and venereal disease department, internal medicine department, surgery department, obstetrics and gynecology department, pediatrics department, or ENT department for treatment. The number of patients registered in the clinic's registration book has increased from dozens to hundreds. In the first fourteen days alone, the clinic has provided initial consultations for 1,365 people.
    The doctors work hard every day. Even when they encounter language difficulties, they patiently repeat their questions and examinations. After giving each person a vaccination, the doctor in the vaccination room always says kindly in Tibetan: "Nijie Maka" (Don't let the sun shine on it). After completing the diagnosis and treatment of a patient, the doctors in each department always say kindly in Tibetan: "Sangning Datong Rongge Yin" (Come again tomorrow or the day after tomorrow).
    Long queues line up outside the vaccination room every day. Tibetan people holding or carrying their children are waiting for vaccination. Ten herdsmen from a remote area in northern Tibet traveled to Lhasa to worship Buddha after two months of trekking. After hearing the news that the People's Liberation Army was providing medical care to the Tibetan people, they rushed to the clinic for treatment.
    A woman named Zhuma Zhaxi carried her one-year-old child, Silang Zuowa, who was ill, from Mozhugongka, 150 miles away, and traveled for four days to Lhasa. After several injections by the doctor, the child's illness has been cured. She said gratefully to the reporter: "The villagers said that the People's Liberation Army treats the common people, so I carried my child and brought zanba."
    Many Tibetan people, after being cured at the People's Liberation Army clinic, have offered candy, eggs, cigarettes, and other gifts to the doctors, and some have even presented hadas to the doctors. The doctors explained to them: "The staff led by Chairman Mao are wholeheartedly serving the people and do not accept any remuneration." They declined these gifts. This working spirit of the People's Liberation Army medical personnel has deeply moved every Tibetan. Many people pray every day: "Bless the People's Liberation Army! Bless Chairman Mao!"

### 在人民解放军拉萨门诊所里

    在人民解放军拉萨门诊所里
    新华社记者  赵慎应
    人民解放军进藏部队在没有医院和近代医疗设备的拉萨，为藏族人民设立了一个比较完备的门诊所。
    一个月来，拉萨的藏胞们都在互相传告着这个喜讯：“快到解放军的门诊所去看病吧，一个钱也不要，治的又灵验。我们多年没有治好的病现在都能治好了。”街上时常有许多人围着观看门诊所张贴的种痘广告，他们一面看一面伸出大拇指连声称赞：“解放军处处为我们打算。”
    在门诊所宽大的院子里整天挤满了看病的藏民，有穿着红绿色服装的妇女，也有披着深红袈裟的喇嘛，他们都有秩序地静候着挂号或到种痘室种痘，或去皮肤花柳科、内科、外科、妇产科、小儿科、五官科等诊治。门诊所挂号簿上登记的病人由几十个增加到几百个。仅在最初的十四天中，门诊所已初诊了一千三百六十五个人。
    医生们每天都紧张地工作着，即使有时遇到言语上的困难，他们仍耐心地反复问诊和检查。种痘室的医生在给每个人种好痘后总是亲切地用藏语向对方说：“尼界玛卡”（别叫太阳晒）。各科的医生们在诊疗完一个病人后，也总是用藏语亲切地说：“桑宁达东融给银”（明天再来或后天再来）。
    种痘室外每天都排着长长的两排行列。藏民们抱着孩子或背着孩子在等待种痘。有十个来自遥远的西藏北部某地的牧民，他们是经过两个月的跋涉到拉萨来朝佛的。他们听到解放军给藏民看病的消息后，就匆忙来到门诊所治病。
    一个名叫竹玛札喜的妇女抱着患病的一岁的孩子思郎作娃，从一百五十里外的墨竹工卡，走了四天赶来拉萨。经过医生的几次注射，孩子的病已痊愈了。她感激地对记者说：“乡里人说解放军给老百姓看病，我就背着孩子带着糌粑来了。”
    许多藏民在解放军的门诊所里治好病后，纷纷拿着糖果、鸡蛋、纸烟等礼物来送给医生，有的还向医生敬献哈达。医生们便向他们解释说：“毛主席领导的工作人员，都是全心全意为人民服务，不受任何报酬。”他们谢绝了这些礼物。解放军医务人员的这种工作精神，使每一个藏民深受感动。有许多人每天祈祷着：“祝福解放军！祝福毛主席！”
