    One of the Major Huai River Harnessing Projects - Foziling Reservoir Begins Construction
    Construction of the Foziling Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Pi River began in early February. Five thousand laborers and many water conservancy experts, engineering technicians, and workers have arrived at the construction site and have begun cleaning the dam foundation. The Pi River originates in Huoshan, western Anhui, flows through Lu'an County, and joins the Huai River at Zhengyangguan, and is an important tributary of the Huai River. The Foziling Reservoir is one of the larger reservoirs planned to be built in the Huai River system. Before the start of construction, preparatory work related to the construction of the reservoir, such as surveying, exploration, and design, took nearly a year. It is expected that the entire project can be completed before the arrival of the flood season in 1953.
    The Foziling Reservoir site is located south of Huoshan County. The main project of the Foziling Reservoir is a reinforced concrete hollow dam, 530 meters long and 70 meters high, connecting two mountains. After a year of research by numerous experts, engineers, and technicians, this most modern hollow dam was chosen from five types of dams. The Huoshan area is a seismic zone, and this hollow dam has sufficient resistance to earthquake shocks from above, below, and the sides. After the completion of the Foziling Reservoir, it can store 470 million cubic meters of floodwater, which can not only relieve the downstream flooding of the Pi River and reduce the flood flow of the Huai River mainstream, but also irrigate 500,000 mu of farmland. The 90-kilometer waterway in the middle and lower reaches of the Pi River from Hengpaitou to Yingheji can also allow the passage of wooden boats with a load of 50 tons. In addition, it can generate 1,300 kW to 3,000 kW of electricity.
    Currently, experts, engineers, and technicians from all over the country are further studying and guiding the construction on the construction site; thousands of skilled workers are opening mountains and building roads, erecting sheds, laying power lines, and installing electric lights. Workers responsible for tying steel bars and pouring concrete have been concentrated in Bengbu. Materials such as steel bars, cement, pine wood, and oil needed for the project are being continuously transported to the Foziling Reservoir construction site from Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places.

    治淮大工程之一—佛子岭水库动工
    修建淠河上游佛子岭水库的工程已经在二月上旬开工了。五千民工和许多水利专家、工程技术人员、工人已到达工地，开始作清理水坝基础的工作。淠河发源在皖西霍山，流过六安县到正阳关汇入淮河，是淮河的一条重要的支流。佛子岭水库是淮河水系中计划修建的许多水库中的比较大的一个。开工以前，测量、勘察、设计等等有关修库的准备工作差不多作了一年，预计全部工程在一九五三年汛期到来以前可以完成。
    佛子岭水库库址在霍山县南。佛子岭水库的主要工程是一条连接两山的长达五百三十公尺、高七十公尺的钢筋混凝土的空心拦河坝。无数专家、工程师和技术干部经过一年之久的研究，才从五种坝式中决定采用这种最近代化的空心坝。霍山一带是地震区，这种空心坝对于上下、两旁的地震震荡力具有足够的抵抗力。佛子岭水库修成后可蓄洪四亿七千万立方公尺，这不但能够解除淠河中下游的水灾，减少淮河干流的洪水流量，还可灌溉五十万亩农田；淠河中、下游从横排头到迎河集九十公里长的航路，并可通行载重五十吨的木船。此外，可发电一千三百瓩到三千瓩。
    现在，来自各地的专家、工程师和技术干部们正在工地上进一步地研究工作和指导施工；上千的技术工人在开山辟路，搭设工棚，架设电线和安装电灯。担任扎钢筋和浇灌混凝土工程的工人已集中到蚌埠。工程上所需用的钢筋、水泥、松木、油料等器材，正从东北、内蒙、上海、南京、济南、青岛等地向佛子岭水库工地源源运来。（新华社）
