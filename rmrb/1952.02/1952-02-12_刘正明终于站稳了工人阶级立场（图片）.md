    (Twenty-five) After Liu Zhengming's mobilization, Mr. Zhou dispelled his concerns and became happy. He resolved to expose Xu Rende and also confessed about Xu Rende's bribery. This made him feel like he had taken good medicine, and his spirits improved greatly. Liu Zhengming further encouraged him.
    (Twenty-six) Mr. Zhou had long forgotten his illness upon hearing this, and he quickly got up to find the fake accounts and old ledgers he had created. At this moment, Xiao Ma also arrived.
    (Twenty-seven) When the three of them came out, they saw the cadres of the Federation of Industry and Commerce talking to Xu Rende, who was still insisting that he had not evaded taxes.

    （二十六）周先生听到这里早就忘了病了，赶紧起床去找他造的假账和老账本。正在这时候小马也来了。
    （二十七）他们三个人出来的时候，看见工商联合会的干部正在和徐仁德说话，徐仁德还是一口咬定没有漏税。
