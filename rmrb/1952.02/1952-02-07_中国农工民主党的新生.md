The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has a history of over twenty years, but due to unclear political and organizational lines, it gives people the feeling of being somewhat aged, and it seems not easy to revitalize it. However, at the recently convened Sixth National Cadre Conference, we saw the power of rebirth, saw a new atmosphere, which strengthened our confidence in the future of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and doubled our courage.

The Sixth National Cadre Conference is of epoch-making significance for the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. The conference determined the general direction of current work, determined the organizational line, clarified the chaotic ideological situation within the Party since the Fifth National Cadre Conference, and liquidated the middle-of-the-road ideology in the history of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. What is particularly worth mentioning and emphasizing here is that this conference adhered to political principles and ideologically distinguished between the enemy and ourselves. The conference was fruitful, marking the progress of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and demonstrating that the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has been and is undergoing changes ideologically, politically, and organizationally.

Naturally, this progress and change will not come about by chance. What is this based on?

First, this meeting was convened after the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This determined the general direction of current work. Especially important for the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is the ideological remolding movement. Only through this movement, and by doing a good job in this movement, can the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party be sound and have the possibility of completing its historical mission.

Second, it is the progress of the entire party. This was achieved on the basis of the progress of the people across the country over the past two years. The vigorous Three Great Movements educated the whole party, enabled many comrades to receive good training in practical work, initially consolidated and comparatively purified the party organization, and gave the party a new look.

In the past, the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party had very little contact with the masses. Little contact with the masses naturally reflected a lack of mass perspective and insufficient adherence to the mass line, which inevitably led to detachment from reality and, therefore, made it difficult to progress. In the past year, hundreds of comrades have participated in study, land reform, and other practical work, tempering themselves in the revolutionary crucible, in the fierce people's struggle, and among the broad masses. They have already taken the people's stand, began to connect with the masses, and developed feelings for the masses. They have become the new blood driving the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party forward.

Since our comrades have improved their awareness in practical work and have a mass perspective and mass feelings, they will naturally adhere to principles. To adhere to principles, ideological struggle is necessary. Only in the face of serious political principles and in the continuous conduct of ideological struggle can unnecessary disputes be avoided and all problems be readily solved.

The most effective way to adhere to principles and conduct ideological struggle is through criticism and self-criticism. Public criticism conducted at the conference was a first in the history of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Such criticism was unimaginable in the past. If it had been in the past, it would certainly have fallen into a whirlpool of unprincipled, emotional, and personal disputes. However, today, the whole party has progressed, everyone's political level has improved, and everyone has adhered to principles, so the criticism has been carried out very well.

In this conference, the first thing to be criticized was the traditional thinking in the history of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party—the middle-of-the-road line. Mr. Deng Yanda, the founder of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, opposed imperialism and feudalism on the one hand, but also opposed the Communist International and the Chinese Communist Party. He believed that the Kuomintang headed by Chiang Kai-shek had indeed betrayed the revolution and was the enemy of the revolution; however, the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Communist International and the Chinese Communist Party would not be victorious and would lead to failure. Therefore, only under the leadership of another force, only by taking another path, could the task of the Chinese revolution be completed. This can be said to be a clear middle-of-the-road line. This middle-of-the-road thinking was once the traditional thinking in the history of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. "There is no third road." This conference has resolutely criticized and negated the "third road."

Due to its opposition to imperialism and feudalism, the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party had its revolutionary and progressive side; due to its distrust of the Soviet Union and opposition to the Communist Party, it also had its reactionary side. The revolutionary and progressive aspects have, of course, been developed, but because there was a reactionary side, it gave reactionaries the possibility of hiding and infiltrating. Through party rectification, study, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the party organization has become relatively pure, but there are still problems that need to be carefully cleared up. The self-criticisms of the three central committee members at this conference illustrate this point. Although all three of them have had a period of revolutionary history and have long party seniority, their strong desire for personal gain and lack of a people's stand led them to commit political errors, either minor or serious, due to ideological errors, causing serious damage to the party's prestige and the interests of the people. Their self-criticisms were not deep enough, and they all tried to reduce their responsibility with terms such as "motives," "subjective," "muddled thinking," and "petty-bourgeois thinking," which is unacceptable to the people.

At this conference, we saw the rise of righteousness and the decline of evil.

This conference was a success. The secret to success was nothing more than adhering to principles and conducting criticism in conjunction with typical examples. Adhering to principles and conducting criticism gave this conference vitality and courage, enabling the party to criticize the past middle-of-the-road line and ideologically distinguish between the enemy and ourselves.

Chairman Mao said: "Ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform and gradually implement industrialization in all aspects." The Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is a political party mainly composed of the urban petty bourgeoisie and is responsible for uniting and educating the urban petty bourgeoisie to advance together under the leadership of the working class. If the ideology of the party members is not remolded first, it will be impossible to shoulder this glorious task.

We must criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and especially eliminate the reactionary, anti-people, and enemy-friend indistinguishable thinking that exists within the party. If reactionary, anti-people, and enemy-friend indistinguishable thinking is not eliminated from the party for a single day, the party will be in danger of being used by counter-revolutionary forces, and the party organization will never be consolidated. The ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie has its reactionary and conservative side. Reactionary and conservative thinking violates the laws of historical development, violates the revolution, and violates the interests of the broad masses of the people. It cannot be reconciled with the working class's selfless ideology. We must criticize and struggle against it. If we do not abandon the position of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, it will be impossible to accept Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. If negative thinking develops to the extreme, there is even a danger of not being able to become a member of the people's democratic united front. This is an extremely important issue that cannot be ignored in the slightest.

This conference has made a good start for the ideological remolding of all our party comrades. It proves that the ideological remolding of our party comrades is not only necessary but also entirely possible. However, what is important is that we must adhere to political principles, conduct ideological struggle, connect with the masses, and especially conduct criticism and self-criticism.

Stalin said: "Without self-criticism... we cannot expose our sores, we cannot eliminate our shortcomings." Let us bravely expose the sores on our bodies and eliminate our shortcomings!

Adhering to principles and conducting criticism and self-criticism is the guiding spirit of this conference of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and is the experience of successful experimentation. We are willing to introduce this experience for everyone's reference. The Sixth National Cadre Conference is the most memorable page in the history of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and it has given the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party a new life.

    中国农工民主党的新生
    中国农工民主党  中央工作委员会宣传部长  严信民
    中国农工民主党已经有二十多年的历史，但因政治路线和组织路线不明确，所以使人感觉得有些衰老，要振作起来，似乎不是一件容易的事情。但是，在新近召开的第六次全国干部会议上，我们看出了新生的力量，看出了新气象，这就坚定了我们对农工民主党的前途的信心，倍增了我们的勇气。
    第六次全国干部会议，对于农工民主党说，是有划时代的意义的。会议决定了目前工作的总方向，决定了组织路线，澄清了第五次全国干部会议以来党内混乱的思想情况，并清算了农工民主党历史上的中间路线思想。在这里值得特别提出、特别强调的，是这次会议坚持了政治原则，从思想上划清了敌我界限。会议是有收获的，它标志了农工民主党的进步，说明农工民主党在思想上、政治上和组织上，都已经和正在发生变化。
    自然，这种进步和变化是不会偶然降临的。这是根据什么来说呢？
    首先，这次会是在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议之后召开的。这就决定了目前工作的总方向。对于农工民主党尤其重要的，是思想改造运动的一部分。只有通过这一运动，搞好这一运动，农工民主党才能健全起来，才有可能完成自己历史的任务。
    其次，是全党的进步。这是在两年来全国人民进步的基础之上获得的。轰轰烈烈的三大运动教育了全党，使许多同志在实际工作当中得到了很好的锻炼，使党的组织初步巩固和比较的纯洁起来，使党的面貌为之一新。
    农工民主党过去是和群众很少联系的。和群众少联系，自然就反映了缺乏群众观点，反映了走群众路线不够，这就一定要脱离实际，因之也就不容易进步。一年来，数以百计的同志参加了学习，参加了土地改革和其他的实际工作，在革命洪炉中，在剧烈的人民斗争中，在广大群众当中锻炼了自己。他们已经有了人民的立场，开始和群众联系，并对群众发生感情。他们成了推动农工民主党前进的新血液。
    我们同志既然在实际工作中提高了自己的觉悟，有了群众观点，群众感情，自然要坚持原则。要坚持原则，就不能不进行思想斗争。只有在严肃的政治原则面前，在不断进行思想斗争中，才不致引起无谓的纠纷，才能使一切问题迎刃而解。
    坚持原则，进行思想斗争最有效的方式，就是批评和自我批评。公开的、在大会上进行的批评，在农工民主党历史上还是第一次。这样的批评，在过去是不能想像的。如果是在过去，就定会堕入无原则的、闹感情、闹人事纠纷的漩涡中。但是，在今天，全党进步了，大家的政治水平提高了，大家坚持了原则，所以批评进行得很好。
    在这次大会中首先进行批判的，是农工民主党历史上的传统思想——中间路线。农工民主党的创党人邓演达先生是一面反对帝国主义和封建主义，但同时又反对共产国际和中国共产党。他认为以蒋介石为首的国民党固然背叛了革命，是革命的敌人；可是，中国革命在共产国际和中国共产党的领导下，是不会胜利，是要走向失败的，因此，只有由另一种势力来领导，只有走另一种道路，才能完成中国革命的任务。这可说是鲜明的中间路线。这种中间路线思想，曾经是农工民主党历史上的传统思想。“第三条道路是没有的。”这次会议上已经对“第三条道路”坚决地加以批判，加以否定了。
    由于反对帝国主义、反对封建主义，农工民主党曾有其革命的、进步的一面；由于不信任苏联、反对共产党，也曾有其反动的一面。革命的、进步的方面，当然是发展了，可是由于有过反动的一面，就给反动分子以潜藏混入之可能。通过整党、学习、镇压反革命，党的组织比较纯洁了，但问题还是有的，还待继续细心地去清理。这次会议上对三位中央委员的检讨，就说明了这一点。他们三位固然都有过一段革命的历史，都有久长的党龄，但由于有浓厚的个人利益的打算，缺少人民的立场，使他们由思想上的错误，而犯了或轻或重的政治上的错误，以致使党的威信和人民利益遭受严重的损失。他们的自我批评都不够深刻，都想以“动机”、“主观”、“糊涂思想”、“小资产阶级思想”等说法，减轻自己的责任，这是向人民交代不下去的。
    我们在这次会议上看到了正气上升，邪气下降。
    这次会议是成功的。获致成功的诀窍，不是别的，就是坚持原则，结合典型的例子进行了批评。坚持原则，进行批评，给这次会议以活力，以勇气，使党批判了过去的中间路线，并从思想上分清了敌我界限。
    毛主席说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”农工民主党是以城市小资产阶级为主要组成部分的政党，负有团结、教育城市小资产阶级在工人阶级领导下共同前进的任务，如果党员的思想不先改造过来，是不可能肩负起这一光荣任务的。
    我们要批评资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，尤其要首先肃清存在于党内的反动、反人民的和敌我不分的思想。反动、反人民的和敌我不分的思想，在党内一天不肃清，党便有被反革命势力利用的危险，党的组织就永不会巩固起来。资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，有其反动的、保守的一面，反动的、保守的思想，是违反历史发展规律，违反革命，违反人民大众的利益的，是和工人阶级大公无私的思想不能符合的。我们一定要批评，要斗争。不放弃资产阶级、小资产阶级的立场，就不可能接受马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，如果消极思想发展到极点，甚至有不能成为人民民主统一战线之一员的危险。这是一个极关重要的问题，不容丝毫忽视。
    这次会议，给我们全党同志的思想改造，已经作了一个良好的开端。证明了我党同志的思想改造，不但必要，而且是完全可能的。不过重要的是：一定要坚持政治原则，进行思想斗争；一定要联系群众；尤其是要进行批评和自我批评。
    斯大林说：“没有自我批评……就不能揭露我们的脓疮，就不能消灭我们的缺点。”让我们勇敢地揭露自己身上的脓疮，消灭自己的缺点吧！
    坚持原则，进行批评和自我批评，是农工民主党这次会议的主导精神，是尝试成功的经验。我们愿意将这经验介绍出来供大家参考。第六次全国干部会议，是农工民主党历史上最值得纪念的一页，它使中国农工民主党获得新生。
