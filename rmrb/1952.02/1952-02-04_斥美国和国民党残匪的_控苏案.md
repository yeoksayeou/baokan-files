　　This month’s first day, disregarding the Soviet Union and the people’s democratic countries’ representatives’ stern condemnation and many other countries’ representatives’ dissatisfaction and disgust, the United States continued to manipulate its increasingly failing voting machine, barely forcing the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass, by a special situation of twenty-six votes to nine votes, with twenty-four abstentions, the Kuomintang remnant bandit group’s proposed shameless slander against the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, the so-called “Accusation Against the Soviets.” This kind of absurd and shameless slander is originally not worth refuting at all, but in this vile slander, the United States' new aggressive conspiracy against China is extremely obvious, so people cannot but be fully vigilant and pay attention to it.
　　The United States and its Kuomintang remnant bandit agents' shameless slander of our great ally—the Soviet Union—and our people is an extremely vile and extremely vulgar act. Everyone knows that the Kuomintang remnant bandit group is a political zombie that has long been unanimously abandoned by the Chinese people and expelled from the Chinese mainland. It cannot represent anyone. It is only an agent of the United States' aggressive interests in China that no longer exists. Only because of the United States' "favor" has it been forcibly kept in the United Nations, becoming a shameful symbol of the United Nations. All the Kuomintang remnant bandit group's shameless actions in the international arena cannot produce the slightest practical significance and value, but can only increase people's disgust for it. When the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee and the General Assembly discussed the Kuomintang remnant bandit representative's proposed "Accusation Against the Soviets" slander case, many Asian countries, such as Burma, India, and Syria, unanimously expressed their indignation and ridicule of the Kuomintang remnant bandit representative and his American master; even the representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, who have always obeyed the orders of the United States, mostly adopted a refusal to support or a passive attitude towards it. This shows how tragic the results the United States and its Kuomintang remnant bandit agents have obtained from this farce.
　　Soviet representative Malik's speech in the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee has thoroughly exposed that this slander by the United States and its Kuomintang remnant bandit agents is a complete fabrication and deception. It is nothing more than a bankrupt slander that any rational and sober person absolutely disdains. Their slander stubbornly insists that the Soviet Union "violated" the 1945 "Sino-Soviet Treaty," but the iron facts prove that the Soviet Union has always earnestly abided by the aforementioned treaty, until after the Chinese people overthrew the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, when the People's Republic of China and the Soviet government jointly announced that the treaty had become invalid. However, during its reactionary rule, during the period when that treaty was in effect, the Kuomintang bandit gang consistently violated the provisions stipulated in the treaty at that time, and constantly carried out anti-Soviet activities, attempting to sell China's Northeast to the United States as a base for attacking the Soviet Union and provoking an anti-Soviet war. Is this fact not enough to illustrate that the Kuomintang bandit gang, which at that time took advantage of the Soviet Union's great friendship with the Chinese people, consistently undermined and violated the spirit of the 1945 "Sino-Soviet Treaty"? Their slander also attempts to portray the overthrow of the Kuomintang bandit gang regime as not a result of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, but as a result of the Soviet Union's "intervention" that they fabricated. However, the well-known facts have completely shattered their nonsense. Even the American master of the Kuomintang remnant bandit group, Acheson, in his published "White Paper," had to admit that the victory of the Chinese revolution "was the product of internal forces in China." As for foreign interference in the Chinese revolution, it did indeed exist, but that interferer was none other than the American aggressor himself, who cried "stop thief!" while stealing. According to various materials statistics, the United States supplied the Kuomintang bandit gang regime with more than 4.3 billion US dollars in military supplies, materials, and loans to help the Kuomintang bandit gang wage an anti-people civil war in China. Only the United States is the robber who interfered in China and invaded China, isn't it obvious? They even more shamelessly and without reason blamed the Soviet Union for not fulfilling Articles 5 and 6 of the 1945 "Sino-Soviet Treaty" and not giving the Kuomintang bandit gang assistance in the Chinese people's liberation war. How absurd and rogue is this! Does it mean that the Soviet Union would allow the unjust act of interfering in other countries' people's revolutionary movements? This absurd slander fully exposes the Kuomintang remnants and their American masters' extremely rogue mentality. Besides expressing their hatred for the increasingly close and consolidated unity and friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, it has no other meaning.
　　The United States and its Kuomintang remnant bandit agents have wasted their efforts in spreading this slanderous anti-Soviet rumor in the United Nations for the third time, but after suffering tragic failures time and time again, they did not hesitate to bring it out again and again, and the United States forced the United Nations General Assembly to pass it. What is their purpose? Their only purpose, undoubtedly, is to divert the attention of the people of the world in order to cover up the United States' intention to use the territory of Burma and other Asian countries to direct the Kuomintang remnant bandits and rearm Japan to launch a new war of aggression against China. This sinister intention of the United States has become clear due to its active funding and direction of Li Mi's troops of the Kuomintang remnant bandits on the Burmese border. This situation has aroused the common anger and condemnation of peace-loving people in Asian countries. This aggressive arrangement and activity of the American aggressors cannot but prompt the people of Asian countries to further unite and strive to jointly prevent new US military adventures in Asia. The Chinese people are seriously watching the development of this situation. If the American aggressors, who have been battered and bruised on the Korean battlefield, do not know how to restrain themselves and want to launch a new military offensive against China, they will inevitably suffer even more惨重的failures.
　　The passage of the "Accusation Against the Soviets" slander case fabricated by the United States and its Kuomintang remnant bandit agents in the United Nations once again proves that the United Nations under the control of the United States has become utterly degenerate. The loss of the United Nations' political and moral authority will thus be even more extreme. The people of the world will laugh with great contempt at the United States' zombie farce and the shameful face of the United Nations!

### 斥美国和国民党残匪的“控苏案”

    斥美国和国民党残匪的“控苏案”
    本月一日，美国不顾苏联和各人民民主国家代表的严厉斥责和其他许多国家代表的不满和憎恶，继续操纵其日渐失灵的表决机器，勉强迫使联合国大会以二十六票对九票、二十四票弃权的特殊情况非法通过了国民党残匪集团所提出的无耻地诽谤苏联和中华人民共和国的所谓“控苏案”。这种荒诞无耻的诽谤本来是完全不值一驳的，但是在这个卑劣的诽谤中极其明显地暴露了美国对中国的新的侵略阴谋，因而人们对它不能不有充分的警惕和注意。
    美国及其国民党残匪代理人对我国伟大的盟邦——苏联和我国人民的无耻诽谤是绝顶卑劣，绝顶下流的行动。谁都知道国民党残匪集团是早已为中国人民所一致弃绝并被驱逐出了中国大陆的一具政治僵尸，它不能代表任何人，它只是早已不复存在的美国在中国侵略利益的代理人。只是由于美国对它的“宠爱”，它才被强留在联合国中，成为联合国的一个可耻的标志。国民党残匪集团在国际上的一切无耻举动，不但不可能产生丝毫的实际意义和价值，而且只能增加人们对它的憎恶。在这次联合国大会政治委员会和大会中讨论国民党残匪代表所提出的“控苏”诽谤案的时候，许多亚洲国家如缅甸、印度、叙利亚的代表一致表示了愤慨，表示了对国民党残匪代表及其美国主子的嘲笑；就连一向服从美国命令的北大西洋集团国家的代表，大部分也对它采取了拒绝支持或消极的态度。这可以看出美国及其国民党残匪代理人从这幕丑剧中所得到的是如何可悲的结果。
    苏联代表马立克在联合国大会政治委员会中的发言，已经彻底揭穿了这种美国及其国民党残匪代理人的诽谤是彻头彻尾的捏造和欺骗，它不过是早已破了产的、任何理智清醒的人所绝对不齿的谰言。它们的诽谤硬说苏联“违反”了一九四五年的“中苏条约”，然而铁的事实证明着苏联始终是认真地遵守着上述的那个条约，一直到中国人民推翻了国民党的反动统治之后，由中华人民共和国和苏联政府共同宣布了那个条约失效为止。而国民党匪帮在其反动统治的期间，在那个条约生效的期间，却一贯违背当时的条约所规定的条款，并不断地进行反苏活动，企图把中国的东北出卖给美国作为进攻苏联的基地，挑拨反苏的战争。这种事实难道不足以说明在那时利用了苏联对中国人民伟大友谊的国民党匪帮是一贯地破坏并违反了一九四五年“中苏条约”的精神吗？它们的诽谤也企图把国民党匪帮政权的被推翻说成不是由于中国人民革命斗争的结果，而是由于它们所捏造的苏联的“干涉”，然而人所共知的事实又彻底粉碎了它们的这种胡说。甚至国民党残匪集团的美国主子的发言人艾奇逊，在他所发表的“白皮书”中，也曾不得不承认中国革命的胜利“是中国内部势力的产物”。至于对中国革命的外国干涉的确也是曾经有过的，但是那个干涉者不是别人，正是作贼喊贼的美国侵略者自己。根据各种材料统计，美国为帮助国民党匪帮在中国进行反人民的内战，曾供给国民党匪帮政权的军火、物资和贷款共达四十三亿美元以上。只有美国才是干涉中国、侵略中国的强盗，不是很明显的吗？它们更无耻地毫无理由地怪罪苏联没有履行一九四五年“中苏条约”的第五条与第六条，没有在中国人民的解放战争中给国民党匪帮以帮助。这够多么荒唐无赖呀！难道说苏联还会允许干涉他国人民革命运动的不义行为吗？这种荒唐的诽谤，充分暴露了国民党残匪及其美国主子的极端无赖心情。这除了表现出它们对中苏两国人民日益亲密和巩固的团结友谊的仇恨之外，是没有任何其他的意义的。
    美国及其国民党残匪代理人在联合国中枉费心机地散布这种诽谤中苏的谰言已经是第三次了，然而它们在一再遭受到悲惨的失败之后，竟不惜再三把它搬出来，并由美国强使联合国大会加以通过，它们的目的究竟何在呢？其唯一的目的，无疑地是为了转移世界人民的注意力，以掩饰美国打算利用缅甸和其他亚洲国家的领土，指使国民党残匪和重新武装日本来进行对中国新的侵略战争的意图。美国这种罪恶用心，已由于它积极资助与指挥缅甸边境的国民党残匪的李弥部队的活动而昭然若揭了。这种情形，已经引起了亚洲各国爱好和平人民的共同愤怒和斥责。美国侵略者的这种侵略布置和活动，不能不促使亚洲各国人民更进一步团结起来，为共同制止美国在亚洲的新的军事冒险而努力。中国人民正在严重地注视着这个局势的发展。如果在朝鲜战场上已被打得头破血流的美国侵略者还不自知检点，而要向中国发动新的军事进攻，它就必然会遭受到更为惨重的失败。
    美国及其国民党残匪代理人所捏造的“控苏”诽谤案在联合国的通过，再次证明了在美国控制下的联合国已经沦落不堪了。联合国政治和道义的权威的丧失将因此而更加达于极点。世界人民将会以极大的轻蔑来嘲笑美国的僵尸丑剧和联合国的可耻面目！
