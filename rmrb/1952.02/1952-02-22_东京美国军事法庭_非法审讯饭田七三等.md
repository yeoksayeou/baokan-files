　　Tokyo American Military Tribunal
　　Illegally Tries Iida Shichizo and Others
　　[This newspaper's report] According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Tokyo: On the 18th, the Tokyo American Military Tribunal began trying the case of seven Japanese Communist Party members, headed by Iida Shichizo, who were falsely accused of engaging in espionage activities against the U.S. military. Democrats pointed out that this case was fabricated by the American "counter-espionage" team, in close collaboration with the Japanese police, in order to create a pretext for intensifying the suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and Japanese patriots, because the Japanese Communist Party and Japanese patriots are conducting a struggle against the rearmament of Japan and against turning Japan into a springboard for American aggression in Asia.
　　The defense lawyers demanded that the case be dismissed.

    东京美国军事法庭
    非法审讯饭田七三等
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：据塔斯社东京讯：十八日，东京美国军事法庭开始审讯以饭田七三为首的七名日本共产党党员的案件，他们被诬告为从事反对美军的间谍活动。民主人士指出：这个案件是美国的“反间谍”队为了制造口实、加紧镇压日本共产党和日本爱国人士，在日本警察密切配合之下捏造出来的。因为日共和日本的爱国人士正在进行反对重新武装日本、反对把日本变成美国侵略亚洲的跳板的斗争。
    辩护律师要求撤销这个案件。
