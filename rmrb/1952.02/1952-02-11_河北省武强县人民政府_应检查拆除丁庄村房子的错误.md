    To the Editors: I want to tell you about something. During the land reform, there was a landlord's house in Dingzhuang Village, Wuqiang County, Hebei Province, consisting of twenty-one rooms, which was not distributed to the peasants because the district office wanted to "borrow" it. At that time, the comrades from the district office told the peasants that when the district office moved out, the house would be distributed by the villagers. The district office was only temporarily borrowing these houses, and the ownership of the houses still belonged to the village. In 1949, the district office moved out, but these houses were not distributed to the peasants; instead, a school was established. In the summer of 1951, the county people's government ordered our village to demolish these houses and send the bricks, tiles, and wood to the county people's government for building new houses. After several discussions between the village cadres and the county people's government, the decision remained to demolish the houses. After repeated requests from the village, three classrooms were left, and the remaining eighteen new brick rooms were all demolished into a complete mess. The bricks, tiles, wood, doors, and windows, etc., that were dismantled were transported to the county people's government by our village, which provided manpower and animal power. At that time, it was the spring plowing and sowing season, which greatly hindered production. The county people's government has a certain amount of construction funds, and I don't know why they adopted this method.

    I think what they did was inappropriate. During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, I hope that the relevant leaders will investigate and handle this matter.

    河北省武强县人民政府
    应检查拆除丁庄村房子的错误
    编辑同志：我要告诉你一件事情。在土地改革时，河北省武强县丁庄村有地主的一套房子计二十一间，没有分给农民。因为区公所要“借住”。当时，区公所的同志对农民说，区公所何时搬走，何时由村中农民分配。区公所是暂时借住这些房子，房子的所有权仍然属于村里。一九四九年，区公所搬走了，但是这些房子没有分配给农民，而是建立了学校。一九五一年夏天，县人民政府命令我村把这些房子拆除，把砖瓦、木料送给县人民政府盖新房子用。经过村干部和县人民政府数次商议，结果仍然要拆。又经村里再三要求，留下了三间教室，其余十八间新砖房一概拆得破七乱八的。拆下来的砖瓦、木料、门窗等等，由我村负担人力、畜力，送往县人民政府。那时候，正是春耕播种时期，对生产的妨碍很大。县人民政府有一定的建设费，不知为何采取这种办法？
    我认为，他们这样做是不恰当的。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，希望有关领导方面对这件事情检查处理。    新生
