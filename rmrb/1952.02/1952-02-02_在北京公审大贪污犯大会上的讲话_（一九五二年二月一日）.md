Comrades!

Today’s meeting profoundly illustrates three issues: First, the harm that major embezzlers inflict upon our national and people’s cause, especially the economic cause, is very serious. We must have sufficient awareness of this situation. Second, the fact that the bourgeoisie is attacking us is very clear, and we cannot be complacent in any way. Third, the fate of major embezzlers is very clear, and there can be no further hesitation. I will now address these three issues separately.

(I) The Serious Harm of Major Embezzlers to the National Economic Cause

After listening to the accusations and verdicts reported at today's meeting, the first strong impression is naturally: the state funds embezzled by these embezzlers represent a serious loss to us. The amount directly embezzled by these embezzlers is over 100 million yuan each; Xue Kunshan embezzled 2.3 billion yuan. If we add up all the embezzled money, the central government organs alone may have lost at least 100 billion yuan. As of January 29th, the central government organs had uncovered 161 major embezzlers, with another 202 individuals as clear targets. Adding in some potential leads, the total is at least 400 to 450 people. The total amount embezzled by these individuals is at least around 100 billion yuan. The amount of small and medium-sized embezzlement has not yet been calculated. How valuable is 100 billion yuan? It can buy 100 million catties of grain, 8 million silver dollars, 100,000 taels of gold, provide food for 280,000 people for a year, buy the complete equipment for 30,000 spindles, buy 66 fighter planes, buy 100,000 dan of cotton, or buy 345,000 bolts of fine cloth. This is by no means a small number. If we add up the total amount embezzled by embezzlers nationwide, it should not be several hundred billion yuan, but several trillion yuan. This money could build about ten of the most modern factories, each accommodating two to three thousand people. However, the main loss caused to the country by major embezzlers is not the absolute amount embezzled, but the other economic losses caused by this criminal embezzlement. This type of loss is often difficult to calculate, but without a doubt, this loss is several times to dozens of times greater than the amount embezzled. For example, Xue Kunshan controlled the state organ’s position in purchasing animal hides, while also opening 19 fur shops in major northern cities. He transferred all the benefits of the fur trade to his own shops and all the losses to the state. This loss is not a matter of several hundred million yuan, but several billion to tens of billions of yuan. Another example is Song Degui, who colluded with profiteers for embezzlement, giving economic intelligence and transportation conveniences that the director of the Central Public Security Department's Administrative Office could obtain, to private merchants. They even colluded with each other to forge various receipts. How much damage did this cause? Without a doubt, it was far more than the amount Song Degui embezzled. If we add up all the direct embezzled funds and the losses caused by embezzlement by embezzlers across the country over the past three years, it should be an alarming figure.

The most destructive of the embezzlers are the economic spies hidden within us. Under the direction of unlawful capitalists, these people use their authority as state personnel to systematically steal state assets, steal state economic intelligence, embezzle state funds, illegally obtain transportation conveniences, and engage in smuggling and tax evasion. These people often do not appear to have any embezzlement on the surface, but in reality, they embezzle the most and cause us the greatest losses. They are the most dangerous enemies of our country and people on the economic front. We must maintain the highest degree of vigilance against these people.

Some people feel that our attack on embezzlers is too public and too intense. They feel that this type of work can be carried out more gently. This is a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the harm of embezzlement and a right-leaning sentiment, which should be opposed.

(II) Facts Prove that the Bourgeoisie Has Been and Is Launching a Frenzied Attack on Us

The facts presented at today's meeting fully prove that the bourgeoisie has been and is launching a frenzied attack on us. To this day, there are still many unlawful capitalists who have not shown any signs of repentance, which means they have not given up their attack. This is a phenomenon that the people of the whole country must pay serious attention to.

Some people say: "In people's democratic China, the Communist Party and the working class are already in a leading position. Although the bourgeoisie is one of the four friends, it is not in a decisive position politically or economically, and there is no way to talk about launching an attack on the working class and the Communist Party. The Communist Party and the People's Government are now shouting about the bourgeois attack, which is clearly a false accusation, or they have ulterior motives."

This kind of argument is, at the very least, a very naive statement, and in fact, it is defending the bourgeois attack. Without a doubt, under the people's democratic system, the Chinese national bourgeoisie is in a position of being led, and their due political and economic status has been stipulated by the Common Program. In the past three years, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has gained unprecedented benefits compared to the more than twenty years of Kuomintang reactionary rule. On the one hand, this is in line with the recovery and development of our entire national economy, and this is as it should be. However, on the other hand, many people in the bourgeoisie do not operate their businesses in accordance with the track stipulated by the Common Program, under the general principle of benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood. After their economic power has become relatively strong and they have gained a certain political position, they are unwilling to act规蹈矩 within the scope of the New Democratic economy. They attempt to develop their economy unlimitedly along the capitalist path. They try every means to weaken the power of the state-owned economy. That is to say, they do not attempt to develop their economy under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class, but to compete with the state-owned economy and the working class for leadership. Of course, now that the people's democratic revolution has been victorious and the leadership of the working class has been established nationwide, it is impossible for the Chinese national bourgeoisie to openly, in an organized and led manner, and on a nationwide scale, compete with the working class for leadership. Many unlawful capitalists attempt to compete with us for this leadership in many departments, many enterprises, and many regions. Because the Chinese bourgeoisie does not have the conditions to lead the Chinese revolution and national construction, and does not have much prestige among the people, they generally do not use open competition, but hidden and despicable methods of struggle, that is, methods of weakening and controlling the state-owned economy from within the state-owned economy. For this shameful purpose, they often send some people into our midst, or pull some people from our midst to be their lackeys. Xue Kunshan, who was sentenced to death today, is one of the typical examples of those sent in by the bourgeoisie, and Song Degui is one of the typical examples of those who were pulled over. But whether it is Xue Kunshan or Song Degui, when they accept the tasks of the bourgeoisie and carry out their work, they are no longer the deputy director of the Business Section of the China Livestock Products Company of the Central Trade Department and the director of the Administrative Office of the Central Public Security Department, but agents of unlawful capitalists wearing the guise of state personnel. In their work posts, they do not wholeheartedly serve the people and our great motherland, but serve the despicable and filthy unlawful capitalists. Communists like Song Degui have long shamefully betrayed their great working class and become lackeys of the bourgeoisie. The people they trust the most are not the Communist Party, not the People's Government, not the People's Liberation Army, not the working class, and not Chairman Mao, but those profit-seeking, self-serving, corrupt, and degenerate capitalists. The state organs they dominate are essentially no longer led by the Communist Party and the working class, but this leadership has been usurped by unlawful capitalists. Can this still not be said to be an attack by the bourgeoisie on us?

Moreover, the methods by which the bourgeoisie attacks us are very frenzied and despicable. You will understand this once you see the methods they use to attack us. As mentioned earlier, one way they attack us is by sending people into our midst. How do they send them? From many situations, it seems they often use some base methods. Some bourgeois representatives originally had quite high positions within the bourgeoisie, such as manager, deputy manager, etc. In order to infiltrate state organs, they can act as car drivers, small clerks, and then gradually develop towards the key departments in charge of funds, materials, and the economy. As long as they can become a purchasing agent, or a warehouse manager, or a section member or clerk in the planning department, or a supervisor in the construction department, they will carry out corrupt activities in these places. They seem to be like blood-sucking vessels inserted into our state organs and economic departments by the bourgeoisie, infinitely harming our country's economic cause. After their position is gradually improved, such as Xue Kunshan, they launch a wanton attack on the state-owned economy on a larger scale. Many organs have now discovered the incalculable damage caused by these representatives of the bourgeoisie within our state organs. This is a painful and unforgettable lesson.

In many cases, the damage caused by people sent in by the bourgeoisie is not as great as the damage caused by people who are pulled over. This is because those who are pulled over are often so-called "old cadres." They have higher positions, greater power, and greater courage to embezzle. The methods by which the bourgeoisie drags them down generally begin with temptation and end with threats. The process of temptation is roughly as follows: First, spread the influence of bourgeois ideology, promote the corrupt and degenerate lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, and stimulate the material desires of our cadres. Then, let them learn to treat guests, give gifts, take kickbacks, and collect commissions. Further, let them engage in individual and relatively large embezzlement activities. Finally, they use methods such as buying shares, dividing profits, opening factories, setting up shops, taking dry salaries, and arranging marriages, plus some threats, to secretly drag some of our cadres with wavering positions into profiteer groups, turning these people into economic spies hidden within us who listen to the bourgeoisie's commands. Song Degui is one such type.

In the face of these vivid and painful facts, can it still be said that the bourgeoisie has not attacked us? Can it still be said that the anti-corruption movement, with its main focus on opposing the bourgeois attack, is a superfluous thing? Comrades, this is not only not a superfluous thing, but a very important and very urgent political task. We must carry the struggle against the bourgeois attack through to the end.

(III) The Fate of Major Embezzlers

I will now talk about the fate of major embezzlers. As mentioned earlier, major embezzlers, whether they are sent in or pulled out, are lackeys of the capitalists, they have committed serious crimes against the country and the people, and they are enemies of the country and the people. Major embezzlers who are economic spies are our most vicious enemies. So, are all major embezzlers without a way out? No, the People's Government reserves a path of repentance and self-renewal for those who have committed major embezzlement crimes. The announcement by Supreme People's Court President Shen Junru at today's meeting that major embezzlers Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu were exempted from criminal punishment is a very good illustration. Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu are both technicians. The reason why they were exempted from criminal punishment is that they responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, completely and voluntarily confessed their embezzlement crimes, and took active actions to report the embezzlement activities of others they knew. Xia Maoru reported seven embezzlers and more than a dozen unlawful merchants. Hang Xiaozu engaged in embezzlement during the uprising in Hong Kong. He had already voluntarily confessed during the rectification study last year, but the leading organs did not deal with it in time. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he voluntarily confessed again, and he usually worked relatively hard and had some inventions. Therefore, as long as they can voluntarily and thoroughly confess and resolutely stand on the side of the people again to fight back against the bourgeois attack, even if they have committed the serious crime of major embezzlement, they still have a future. If they do not voluntarily confess, or if their confession is not thorough, and they cannot perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes in the anti-corruption struggle, they will not receive the same treatment as Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu, but should receive the criminal punishment they deserve. Lei Yaqing was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, which is such an example. Wang Piye, like Xia Maoru, is a construction engineer. In this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, he helped the People's Government uncover many instances of shoddy work and the use of inferior materials by profiteering construction merchants, recovering a total of more than 8 billion yuan. This is considered work done to atone for his crimes, but because his embezzlement crime was not voluntarily confessed, but was forced out, he should be sentenced to five years in prison. Also, because his confession is not yet thorough, and he has performed meritorious service to atone for his crimes, he is given a suspended sentence to observe his future behavior; in addition, he is given an administrative punishment of dismissal from his position. Sun Jianguo was originally a Communist Party member (who had already been expelled from the party) and a revolutionary soldier, but he dared to collude with private merchants to embezzle and take bribes, and he should be severely punished. However, considering that he completely and voluntarily confessed his crimes in this anti-corruption struggle and helped the People's Government report profiteers, he is sentenced to ten years in prison, suspended for probation to observe his future behavior; in addition, he is given an administrative punishment of dismissal from his position. Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu should both be given an administrative punishment of demotion by one grade and a major demerit to show punishment. As for major embezzlers like Xue Kunshan and Song Degui, their crimes are extremely heinous and are different from the situations of the above five people, so they must be sentenced to death. All major embezzlers must understand: when you have committed major embezzlement, you have committed a serious crime and should be punished by national law. However, if you voluntarily and thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, return the embezzled goods, and can perform meritorious service to atone for your crimes in the anti-corruption struggle, you can reduce or even be exempt from your criminal punishment. Therefore, before the government pronounces a verdict on you, the severity of the criminal punishment and whether or not you are exempted from criminal punishment depends on your own attitude. On this point, you have complete initiative, and you should clearly distinguish the path you should take.

Those major embezzlers who refuse to confess should wake up from now on. Do not believe in the so-called "alliance of offense and defense." Do not think that after signing a so-called "alliance of offense and defense," you can forever keep your embezzlement secrets. This is first of all not right, and at the same time, it is impossible. The reason why it is "not right" is very obvious. At this time, why are you still signing an "alliance of offense and defense"? The so-called "alliance of offense and defense" must have "offense" and "defense." What are you "attacking"? You are attacking the great motherland, the hardworking and brave people, the working class that leads the Chinese revolution to victory, the great peasant class, the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government that has high prestige, the most beloved People's Liberation Army, the state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature, and Chairman Mao is the general representative of all this. What are you "attacking"? This kind of attack is the most reactionary, backward, and despicable. I advise you to stop this kind of attack quickly.

There is also the so-called "defense." What are you "defending"? And why are you "defending" it? On the surface, you are "defending" this embezzlement secret or that embezzlement secret, "defending" this stolen money or that stolen money, "defending" this false account or that false account, but in reality, you are "defending" the interests of a few unlawful capitalists. You maintain your loyalty to a few unlawful capitalists in the position of slaves. What is the value of this? Especially in China where the revolution has been victorious, China where large-scale economic construction is about to begin, and China where the future of socialism and communism is already in sight, what is the way out for defending the interests of a few unlawful capitalists and defending embezzlement? This so-called "alliance of offense and defense" is the most foolish and most reactionary "alliance of offense and defense." Maintaining the so-called "alliance of offense and defense" is not only not right, but also impossible. The purpose of embezzlement is nothing more than "money." Can people who "only seek profit" talk about "trustworthiness"? What way do you have to guarantee that no one will voluntarily confess or be broken through?

In the past, some major embezzlers were unwilling to confess, mostly because they were afraid of death. Now that there is a path that can avoid death, I believe many major embezzlers will be willing to confess thoroughly. In the past, some major embezzlers were unwilling to confess, especially some major embezzlers of an economic espionage nature were unwilling to confess, for another reason, because they thought the government would not easily find their materials, especially not easily reach the amount of 100 million yuan, and they tried to escape the punishment for major embezzlers in this way. In order to break this kind of person's fantasy, the government now stipulates that as long as the embezzlement is serious and there is solid evidence, no matter how the person refuses to admit it, whether it reaches 100 million yuan or not, he can be determined to be a major embezzler and sentenced to death.

All major embezzlers should choose their own path between the death penalty, imprisonment, and exemption from punishment. The deadline for voluntary confession at the central level has been postponed to February 15th at the request of some units. This is the last chance. I hope all major embezzlers do not miss this last opportunity. (Attached images)

    在北京公审大贪污犯大会上的讲话
    （一九五二年二月一日）
    中央节约检查委员会主任  薄一波同志们：
    今天这个大会很深刻地说明了三个问题：第一，大贪污犯对于我们国家和人民的事业，首先是经济事业的危害是很严重的，我们对于这种情况，不能没有足够的估计。第二，资产阶级向我们进攻的事实，已十分明显，不能有任何麻痹。第三，大贪污犯的出路，已经十分明白，不能再行犹豫。我现在就分别来讲这三个问题。
    （一）大贪污犯对于国家经济事业的严重危害性
    同志们听了今天大会上的检举和判决报告之后，首先一个强烈的印象，自然是：被这些贪污分子所贪污掉的国家资金，对于我们是一个严重的损失。这些贪污分子直接贪污的数目，都在一亿元以上，薛崑山则贪污了二十三亿。如果把被贪污的钱加起来，单单中央各机关，至少可能有一千亿元左右。到一月二十九日为止，中央各机关已经破获大贪污犯一百六十一人，有了明确对象的还有二百零二人，再加上一些可能的线索，总计至少有四百到四百五十人。这些人贪污的总数，至少要达到一千亿元左右。至于中、小贪污的数目，还没有计算在内。一千亿元有多大的价值呢？可以买一亿斤粮食，可以买八百万元白洋，可以买十万两黄金，可以供给二十八万人吃一年，可以买三万纱锭的全部设备，可以买六十六架战斗机，可以买十万担棉花，可以买三十四万五千匹细布。这绝不是一个小的数字。如果把全国贪污分子所贪污的数字，都加起来，应当不是几千亿元，而是几万亿元。这些钱可以办十个左右的最新型的容纳两三千人的大工厂。但是，大贪污分子对国家所造成的损失，主要的还不在于所贪污的绝对数字，而在于因为这种罪恶的贪污行为所造成的其他方面的经济上的损失，这种损失，往往很不容易计算，但是毫无疑问，这种损失要比被贪污掉的数目大几倍到几十倍。比方薛崑山，控制了国家机关内皮毛收购的地位，同时又在北方各大城市开设了十九家皮毛店，他把皮毛贸易上的一切好处，都归给他自己的商店，一切的损失，都转嫁给国家。这种损失就不是几亿元的问题，而是几十亿上百亿元的问题。又比方宋德贵，为了贪污和奸商勾结，把中央公安部行政处长可能得到的经济情报和交通运输上的各种便利，都给了私商，甚至彼此沟通，假造各种单据。这种损失究竟有多大呢？毫无疑问，要比宋德贵贪污的数目大得多。如果把三年来全国各地贪污分子直接贪污的款项和贪污所造成的损失统统加起来，应当是一笔惊人的数字。
    贪污分子中破坏性最大的，是隐藏在我们内部的经济上的奸细。这种人在不法的资本家指使之下，利用国家工作人员的职权，有计划地盗窃国家资财，盗窃国家经济情报，盗用国家资金，非法取得交通运输上的便利，实行走私漏税，这种人往往在表面上看不出有什么贪污行为，实际上贪污最多，给我们的损失最大，是我们国家和人民在经济战线上最危险的敌人，我们对于这种人，应保持最高度的警惕。
    有些人觉得，我们对贪污犯的进攻太张扬，太激烈。他们觉得可以比较温和地进行这一类工作。这是对贪污的危害性认识不足的表现，是一种右倾的情绪，这种情绪，应该加以反对。
    （二）事实证明，资产阶级曾经而且正在向我们进行猖狂的进攻
    今天大会的事实，充分证明资产阶级曾经而且正在向我们进行猖狂的进攻。到今天，还有许多不法的资本家没有悔过自新的表示，也就是还没有放弃进攻的表示，这是全国人民必须严重注意的现象。
    有人说：“在人民民主的中国，共产党和工人阶级已经处于领导地位，资产阶级虽然是四个朋友之一，但是，在政治上和经济上都不处于决定性的地位，根本谈不到对工人阶级和共产党发动什么进攻。共产党和人民政府现在大叫资产阶级进攻，显然是无的放矢，或者别有用心。”
    这种论调，最低限度是一种十分幼稚的说法，事实上是为资产阶级的进攻作辩护的。毫无疑问，中国民族资产阶级在人民民主制度下，是居于被领导的地位，他们应有的政治上和经济上的地位，已经有共同纲领加以规定。三年来，中国民族资产阶级比国民党反动统治的二十几年中，得到了空前的利益。这种情况，一方面说来是和我们整个国家经济的恢复和发展的状况相适应的，这也是应当的。但是，另外一个方面，资产阶级中有许多人并不按照共同纲领所规定的轨道，在有利于国计民生的总原则下，经营自己的业务。他们在自己的经济力量比较壮大、政治上有了一定地位之后，就不愿意在新民主主义经济范围内循规蹈矩的活动，他们企图在经济上按照资本主义的道路无限制的发展，他们想尽一切方法来削弱国营经济的力量，这就是说，他们不是企图在国营经济和工人阶级的领导下面发展自己的经济，而是要和国营经济和工人阶级争夺领导权。当然，在人民民主革命已经胜利、工人阶级在全国范围内的领导权已经确立的今天，中国民族资产阶级不可能明目张胆地、有组织有领导地、在全国范围内，和全体规模上和工人阶级争夺领导权。许多不法的资本家却企图在许多部门、许多企业、许多地区中，和我们争夺这种领导权。由于中国的资产阶级没有领导中国革命和国家建设的条件，在人民中也没有多大的威信，所以这种关于领导权的斗争，他们一般的不是用公开争夺的方法，而是用暗藏的同时也是卑劣的斗争方法，也就是从国营经济内部来削弱来控制国营经济的方法。为了这个可耻的目的，他们往往派一些人到我们内部来，或者从我们内部拉一些人过去作他们的走狗。今天被判处死刑的薛崑山就是资产阶级派进来的典型之一，宋德贵则是被拉过去的典型之一。但是不论薛崑山也好，宋德贵也好，当他们接受资产阶级的任务进行工作时，他们已经不是中央贸易部中国畜产公司业务处的副处长和中央公安部行政处的处长，而是穿着国家工作人员的外衣的不法资本家的代理人，他们在工作岗位上，不是忠心耿耿地为人民服务，为我们伟大的祖国服务，而是为卑鄙龌龊的不法的资本家服务。像宋德贵那样的共产党员，早已可耻地叛变了自己的伟大的工人阶级，成为资产阶级的奴才。他们最信服的人，不是共产党，不是人民政府，不是人民解放军，不是工人阶级，也不是毛主席，而是那些唯利是图、损人利己、假公济私、腐化堕落的资本家。他们所霸占的国家机关，实质上已经不是由共产党、工人阶级来实行领导，而是被不法的资本家篡夺了这种领导权。这还能说不是资产阶级向我们进攻吗？
    不仅如此，资产阶级对我们进攻的方法，还是十分猖狂和卑鄙的。只要看一看他们向我们进攻的方法，大家就会明白。前面说过，他们向我们进攻的方法，一种是派人到我们里面来。他们是怎样派法呢？从许多情况看来，他们往往采取一些下流的方法。有些资产阶级代表，在资产阶级内部本来有相当高的地位，如经理、副经理等，为了钻到国家机关内部来，他们可以充当汽车司机、小办事员，然后逐渐向掌管经费、物资以及经济的要害部门发展，只要能当上一个采购员，或者仓库管理员，或者计划部门的科员、办事员，或者修建部门的监工员，他们就在这些地方进行贪污腐化的活动。他们好像是资产阶级插到我们国家机关和经济部门的吸血管一样，无限制地损害着我们国家的经济事业。等他们的地位逐步提高以后，例如薛崑山这样，他们就在更大的规模上放肆地向国营经济进攻。现在许多机关都发现了这种资产阶级的代表在我们国家机关内部所造成的难以估计的损害。这是一个沉痛的、永远不应该忘记的大教训。
    资产阶级派进来的人所造成的损害，在许多情形下，还没有拉过去的人所造成的损害大。因为被拉过去的往往是所谓“老干部”，他们地位较高，权力较大，贪污的胆量也大。资产阶级拖他们下水的方法，一般首先是利诱，最后加以威胁。利诱的过程大体是这样，首先是散布资产阶级思想影响，宣传资产阶级腐化堕落的生活方式，刺激我们干部的物质生活欲望，然后让他们学习请客，送礼，吃回扣，拿佣金，再进一步就让他们作个别的比较大的贪污活动，最后，则是用入股、分红、开厂、设店、拿干薪、招亲等方法，另加若干威胁，把我们一些立场不坚定的干部在秘密状态下拖入了奸商集团，使这些人蜕化成为隐藏在我们内部的、听资产阶级指挥的经济奸细。宋德贵就是这种类型里的一个。
    在这些活生生的惨痛的事实面前，还能说资产阶级没有对我们作过什么进攻吗？还能说以反贪污作为主要内容的反对资产阶级进攻的运动是多余的事情吗？同志们，这不但不是多余的事情，而是十分重要十分紧迫的政治任务，我们必须把反对资产阶级进攻的斗争进行到底。
    （三）大贪污犯的出路
    我现在来谈一谈大贪污犯的出路问题。前面说过，大贪污犯不管是派进来的或者拉出去的，都是资本家的走狗，都给国家和人民造下了严重的罪恶，都是国家和人民的敌人。属于经济内奸性质的大贪污犯，则是我们最凶恶的敌人。那末，大贪污犯是不是统统没有出路了呢？不是的，人民政府对于犯了大贪污罪的人，是为他们保留着悔过自新的道路的。今天大会上最高人民法院沈钧儒院长已宣布免除大贪污犯夏茂如、杭效祖两人的刑事处分，就是一个很好的说明。夏茂如、杭效祖两人都是技术人员，他们之所以免予刑事处分，是因为他们在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中响应了中国共产党和中央人民政府的号召，完全自动地并且彻底地坦白了自己的贪污罪过，而且采取了积极的行动，检举他们所知道的其他人的贪污行为。夏茂如检举了七个贪污分子和十几家不法商人。杭效祖在香港起义时发生了贪污行为，在去年整风学习时他即已自动坦白，但领导机关未及时处理，此次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动他又自动坦白，而且平时工作比较努力，有若干创造发明。所以只要能够自动彻底坦白，并且坚决地重新站在人民方面来向资产阶级的进攻进行反击，虽然是犯了大贪污的重罪，仍然是有前途的。如果不自动坦白，或坦白不彻底，又不能在反贪污的斗争中立功赎罪，则不能受到夏茂如、杭效祖那样的待遇，而应当受到应得的刑事处分。雷亚卿判处十五年徒刑，就是这种例证。王丕业和夏茂如一样，是个建筑工程师。他在此次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中帮助人民政府检查出许多营造业奸商的偷工减料行为，追回金额共达八十余亿，算是做了赎罪的工作，但因他的贪污罪不是自动坦白的，而是被迫说出的，故应处以五年徒刑。又因其坦白尚彻底，并已立功赎罪，故予缓期执行，以观后效；另在行政上予以撤职处分。孙建国原是共产党员（早已开除党籍），又是革命军人，竟敢勾结私商，贪污受贿，本应严办，姑念他在此次反贪污斗争中完全自动坦白其罪行，并帮助人民政府检举奸商，故处以十年徒刑，缓期执行，以观后效；另在行政上予以撤职处分。夏茂如、杭效祖，则均应给以降一级使用和记大过一次的行政处分，以示惩戒。至于像薛崑山、宋德贵那样罪大恶极的大贪污犯，和上述五人的情况均不相同，故必须处以死刑。一切大贪污犯都必须明白：你们有了大贪污行为时，即已犯了严重的罪过，就应当受到国法的制裁，但是，如果你们自动彻底坦白，真诚悔过，退出赃物，并能在反贪污斗争中立功赎罪，就能减轻甚至于免除你们的刑事处分。所以，在政府对你们宣判以前，刑事处分的轻重以及免除刑事处分与否，决定于你们自己的态度，在这一点上，你们有完全的主动权，你们应当清醒地辨别你们自己应该走的道路。
    那些拒不坦白的大贪污犯，应当从此以后清醒过来，你们不要再迷信什么“攻守同盟”，不要以为订了所谓“攻守同盟”之后，就可以永远保持你们贪污的秘密。这首先是不应该的，同时也是不可能的。“不应该”的道理是很显然的，到现在这种时候，还订什么“攻守同盟”呢？所谓“攻守同盟”必然有“攻”有“守”，你们“攻”的是什么呢？是伟大的祖国，是勤劳勇敢的人民，是领导中国革命走向胜利的工人阶级，是伟大的农民阶级，是伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，是有崇高威信的中央人民政府，是最可爱的人民解放军，是社会主义性质的国营企业，而毛主席就是这一切的总代表，你们“攻”什么呢？这种进攻是最反动的、落后的、卑鄙的，我劝你们赶快停止你们这种进攻。
    还有所谓“守”，你们“守”什么呢？为什么而“守”呢？表面上看来，你们“守”了这种贪污秘密或者那种贪污秘密，“守”了这种赃款或者那种赃款，“守”着这本假账或者那本假账，实际上“守”着少数不法资本家的利益，你们以奴才的地位保持着对少数不法资本家的忠诚，这有什么价值呢？特别是在革命已经胜利的中国，大规模的经济建设即将开始的中国，社会主义共产主义的前途已经在望的中国，为少数不法资本家的利益而守，为贪污而守，有什么出路呢？这种所谓“攻守同盟”，是最愚蠢的最反动的“攻守同盟”。保持所谓“攻守同盟”，不仅是不应该的，而且是不可能的。贪污的目的不过是为了“钱”，“唯利是图”的人能够谈得上“信义”吗？你们有什么法子保证不会有人自动坦白或者被人攻破呢？
    过去有些大贪污犯之所以不肯坦白，多数是因为怕死，现在有了可以不死的道路，我相信许多大贪污犯是会愿意彻底坦白的。过去有些大贪污犯之所以不肯坦白，特别是一些经济内奸性的大贪污犯之所以不肯坦白，另外一个原因，是因为他们以为政府不容易找出他们的材料，特别不容易凑满一亿元，他们就企图这样来逃脱大贪污犯的处分。为了打破这种人的幻想，政府现在规定：只要贪污的情节严重，并有了确实的证据，不管他本人怎样拒不承认，满一亿元或者不满一亿元，都可以定其为大贪污犯，判处死刑。
    一切大贪污犯，都应当在死刑、徒刑、免刑之间，选择自己的道路。中央一级坦白截止期，根据有些单位的要求，推迟至二月十五日为止。这是最后的机会，希望一切大贪污犯不要失去这一个最后的时机。（附图片）
