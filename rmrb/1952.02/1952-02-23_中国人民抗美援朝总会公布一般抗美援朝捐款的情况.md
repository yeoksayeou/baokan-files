(Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd) The China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association has received 182,857,724,130 yuan (including book and newspaper payments, etc.) in comfort money from people across the country to慰问 the front lines, from November 20, 1950, to January 21, 1952. Of the aforementioned comfort money: 149,173,827,914 yuan was entrusted by the original donors to the local People's Bank of China for collection and remittance to the General Association, with receipts issued by the local collecting bank; another 33,683,413,116 yuan was directly remitted to the General Association by the original donors through local People's Banks or post offices, with receipts issued by the General Association. The General Association specifically publishes a statistical breakdown of the comfort money directly remitted to the General Association by donors from various regions, categorized by region, government departments, names, etc. (the statistical table can be found in the February 23rd People's Daily). If original donors in various regions discover any omissions in the announced amount of comfort money or discrepancies with the receipt of the original donation amount, they can immediately notify the General Association for thorough investigation. As for the comfort donations entrusted by donors to the local People's Banks for collection, since the local People's Banks only report the total amount of comfort money in each region to the General Association and do not report the units and names of the donors, the General Association is unable to specifically announce the units and names of this portion of donors. The General Association has specifically instructed the local general branches and branches to work with the local People's Banks to publish detailed information in local newspapers or other ways, based on the General Association's method of publicizing this donation. If original donors discover any discrepancies or omissions in the comfort money collected by local People's Banks, they should directly check with the local Resist America, Aid Korea branch and the People's Bank that originally collected the money.
    Comfort money received after January 21, 1952, will be announced separately.

    中国人民抗美援朝总会公布一般抗美援朝捐款的情况
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会自一九五○年十一月二十日起至一九五二年一月二十一日止，收到全国人民慰问前方的慰劳金已达一千八百二十八亿五千七百二十四万一千零三十元（包括书报代金等）。上述慰劳款中有：一千四百九十一亿七千三百八十二万七千九百十四元，是由原捐款人请各该地中国人民银行代收后转汇解总会收的，收据由当地代收银行出；其中另有三百三十六亿八千三百四十一万三千一百一十六元，是由各原捐款人经各地人民银行或邮局直接汇寄总会的，由总会开出收据。总会特将各地捐款者直接寄汇总会的慰劳款，按地区、机关单位、姓名等分别统计公布（统计表见二十三日人民日报）。各地原捐款人若发现所公布之慰劳款数目有遗漏或与原捐款数目的收据有不符合之处，可即通知总会，以便彻查。至于捐款人请各地人民银行代收之慰劳捐款，因各地人民银行对代收捐款，仅向总会报告各该地区之慰劳款总数目，而未报告捐款者的单位和姓名，因此总会无法具体公布这一部分捐款人的单位和姓名，此点总会已特别责成当地的各总分会、分会会同当地人民银行，依据总会公布此项捐款的办法，也在当地的报纸上或用其他办法详细公布。原捐款人若发现对各地人民银行代收的慰劳款有不符合或遗漏情况时，直接向原收款之当地抗美援朝分会和人民银行查对。
    一九五二年一月二十一日以后收到的慰劳金将另行公布。
