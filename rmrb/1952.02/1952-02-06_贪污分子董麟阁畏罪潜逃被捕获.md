    Embezzler Dong Linge Flees in Fear of Punishment and is Apprehended
    Editor: Dong Linge, a clerk at the Marketing Department of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, fled in fear of punishment on the evening of January 8th after being exposed for embezzling 5.2 million yuan. The cooperative, in conjunction with the public security organs, dispatched personnel in three directions to pursue and apprehend him, and on the 16th, Dong was captured in the Northeast and brought back to justice. During interrogation, Dong remained cunning and refused to confess the truth. According to materials in the hands of the leadership, he embezzled at least 48 million yuan in handling fees and colluded with private merchants to steal and sell twenty taels of gold. Dong's case is serious and involves many people.
    The North China Cooperative held a meeting on January 20th to denounce Dong Linge. The masses were extremely resentful of Dong's consistent theft of state assets and his persistent recalcitrant attitude, and they demanded that he be immediately handed over to the government for legal action. Finally, Guo Xianrui, Deputy Director of the cooperative, announced that Dong would be dismissed from his position and handed over to the court for processing. Dong was arrested on the spot. At the same meeting, it was also announced that lenient treatment would be given to Qin Zhongkang (who embezzled more than 6 million yuan), who had confessed relatively well: only the return of the embezzled funds (3 million yuan has already been returned), a demotion (from deputy section chief to clerk), and exemption from legal punishment. This clear contrast shows that it is impossible for embezzlers to escape the net of justice, and only confession can reduce or eliminate punishment.

    贪污分子董麟阁畏罪潜逃被捕获
    编辑同志：华北供销合作总社推销处科员董麟阁，在一月八日晚暴露曾贪污五百二十万元后，畏罪潜逃。经合作总社和公安机关联系，派员分三路追缉，已在十六日把董犯从东北捕获归案。在审讯中，董犯仍然狡赖，坚不吐实。据领导方面掌握的材料，他贪污的手续费至少有四千八百万元，并曾勾结私商盗卖黄金二十两。董犯案情严重，牵连很广。
    华北合作总社在一月二十日召开了斗争董麟阁的大会。群众对董犯一贯盗窃国家资财和始终采取顽抗的态度，极端愤恨，纷纷要求立即交政府法办。最后合作总社副主任郭献瑞宣布把董犯撤职，送交法院处理。董犯当场被捕。在这个会上，同时宣布了给坦白较好的贪污分子秦仲康（贪污六百多万元）以宽大处理：只退赃（现已退三百万元）、降职（由副科长降为科员），免予法律处罚。这一鲜明的对照，说明了贪污犯要逃出法网是不可能的，只有坦白才可减罪、免罪。
