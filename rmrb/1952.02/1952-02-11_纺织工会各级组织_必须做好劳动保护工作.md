    Trade Union Organizations at All Levels
    Must Do a Good Job in Labor Protection

    Editor: According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, from January to October, a total of 484 work-related injuries occurred in Tianjin factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau. Administrative expenditures on medical expenses and wages during the medical period alone amounted to more than 260 million yuan. In the eight state-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao, a total of 3,566 workdays were lost due to work-related injuries in the ten months from January to October, also incurring considerable medical expenses and wages during the medical period. These figures only represent the losses in state-owned textile factories in Tianjin and Qingdao. If we calculate the losses for textile factories nationwide, adding the physical suffering of workers and the losses in production efficiency, the numbers would be even more staggering. Therefore, strengthening labor protection and reducing work-related accidents are of great significance to the increase production and practice economy movement and are also a trick to increase production and practice economy. To this end, we suggest: (1) Trade union organizations at all levels must regard doing a good job in labor protection as one of the important tasks in carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement; (2) Establish and improve labor protection committees at the grassroots level; (3) Adopt various methods to conduct safety education for workers; (4) Establish a strict labor protection inspection system and mobilize the masses to supervise it. The trade union should promptly commend enterprises and model workers who have made remarkable achievements in improving labor protection work and request the government to reward them. The trade union should seriously investigate the responsibility of enterprises or individuals who neglect worker safety, promptly offer criticism, and, when necessary, even file lawsuits according to law to achieve the goal of safe production.

### 纺织工会各级组织  必须做好劳动保护工作

    纺织工会各级组织
    必须做好劳动保护工作
    编辑同志：根据中国纺织工会天津市委员会的统计，华北纺织管理局所属天津各厂一月到十月共发生工伤事故四百八十四件，只医疗费和医疗期间的工资，行政方面就耗费了两亿六千多万元。青岛国棉八个纺织厂，一月到十月的十个月中，因工伤缺勤的计有三千五百六十六个工作日，也耗费了不少的医药费和医疗期间的工资。这还只是天津、青岛两地国营纺织厂的损失，如按全国纺织厂的损失来计算，再加上工人身体上所遭到的损失和在生产效率减低方面的损失，那就一定更惊人了。所以，加强劳动保护工作，减少工伤事故，对增产节约运动有很重大的意义，也是增产节约的一个窍门。为此，我们建议：（一）纺织工会各级组织必须把做好劳动保护工作，看成是开展增产节约运动中的重要工作之一；（二）建立、健全基层组织劳动保护委员会；（三）采取各种方法，对工人进行安全教育；（四）建立严格的劳动保护检查制度，并发动群众予以监督。对改善劳动保护工作有显著成绩的企业和模范职工，工会应及时表扬，并提请政府给以奖励；对忽视工人安全的企业或个人，工会应认真追究其责任，及时提出批评，在必要时还可以依法起诉，以达到安全生产的目的。
