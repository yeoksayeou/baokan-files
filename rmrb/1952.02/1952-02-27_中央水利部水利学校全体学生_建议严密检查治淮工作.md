    Central Water Conservancy Department Water Conservancy School All Students
    Suggest Strictly Inspecting the Huai River Project

    Editor: After reading the short commentary "Must Punish奸商Who Sabotage the Huai River Project" published in the People's Daily on February 19th, we were all very angry. Chairman Mao called on us to "be sure to fix the Huai River well." Soviet experts, working cadres, and millions of laborers worked day and night selflessly to eliminate historical water disasters. However, there are竟奸商who have lost all humanity and only seek profit, disregarding the life and death of the people on both sides of the Huai River, using inferior goods to充好货and reaping exorbitant profits. The selfish behavior of these奸商has reached an intolerable point.

    All the students in our school resolutely demand that the government severely punish these illegal奸商and suggest that the leading authorities of the Huai River project vigorously carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign and conduct strict inspections to ensure the successful completion of the Huai River project.

    All students of the Water Conservancy School, Central People's Government Ministry of Water Conservancy

    中央水利部水利学校全体学生
    建议严密检查治淮工作
    编辑同志：我们读了人民日报二月十九日刊载的“必须惩罚破坏治淮工程的奸商”的简评后，都非常愤怒。毛主席号召我们“一定要把淮河修好”，苏联专家、工作干部以及数百万民工日夜不息地忘我地工作，以消灭历史性的水害。但竟有丧尽人性、唯利是图的奸商，不顾淮河两岸人民的死活，以坏货充好货，获取暴利，这些奸商的自私自利行为已达到不可容忍的地步。
    我们全校同学坚决要求政府严惩这些不法奸商，并建议治淮工程的领导机关大力开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，进行严密检查，使治淮工程胜利完成。
    中央人民政府水利部水利学校全体同学
