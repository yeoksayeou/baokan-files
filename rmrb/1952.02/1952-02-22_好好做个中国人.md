A good horse is run out, good steel is smelted, and a car driver who travels a thousand miles at night fights with enemy planes.

From preparing the car at three or four in the afternoon until seven or eight in the morning the next day, the Fifth Transportation Company is busy all night. Only the sleeping time during the day is relatively quiet. I was taking time in the company headquarters to sort out my notes when a young man in a sheepskin coat came to the door.

"Why aren't you sleeping?" the company commander said. "What's the matter?"

"Nothing. Just here to exchange a detonator."

"Can't this little thing wait until after dinner? You'll be getting up again before it's even time. You never sleep properly."

"I slept enough already. A full four hours."

"Then sit down and talk," the company commander said. Probably, like the volunteer army drivers I have met in the past year, he is completely satisfied with sleeping four or five hours a day. The company commander introduced me:

"This is Zhao Liangxuan, the one who clears the wind-thunder bombs."

A feeling of reverence suddenly surged in my heart: It's him! A twenty-one-year-old youth, slender and of medium height, with slightly red eye sockets, sticky eyelashes drooping, and sharp light shining from his eyes from time to time. - When he talked about this matter, the overly tired face also lit up:

"If the enemy planes weren't forcing me, I wouldn't have done it," Zhao Liangxuan said. That was on June 29th last year, at a little after four in the afternoon. At that time, the enemy planes' policy of indiscriminate bombing was in full swing. He was fully loaded with a large truck of detonators, heading to the front, originally wanting to rush across the intersection before dark and slip through the blockade line. But the intersection was jammed with cars from all directions.

Three wind-thunder bombs lay in the middle, with their wings spread, arranged in a row right on the road. Cars would set one off if they passed over them. More than a dozen similar ones were scattered near the highway, impossible to bypass.

This was a highway intersection that enemy planes would inevitably bomb and strafe every night. Chief of Staff Zhang of the traffic command post was so anxious that he personally came to try to eliminate the threat. Everyone used guns to shoot, but they didn't explode; they used fire to burn, but they didn't explode; they pulled a long grass rope at both ends, trying to push it to the side of the road, but the rope broke before the bombs moved. Thirty-odd people couldn't handle it, and the engineering corps couldn't arrive for a while, but the surrounding cars were getting more and more numerous.

Zhao Liangxuan's car was fully loaded with detonators. He was afraid of bumps and collisions while driving on the road, let alone being stuck in the middle of a group of cars, waiting to be hit. The ammunition and supplies in dozens of cars at the intersection would be enough for the enemy to feast on if they were delivered to the front. If they were destroyed here, it would be a waste of lives and cars would block traffic, and the front wouldn't get any use out of them. Just three small bombs the size of teacups could block cars coming from all directions; how bullying! Zhao Liangxuan was anxious and angry. The more angry he got, the more anxious he became, and the night bombers were buzzing in the distance again.

"Can they be thrown by hand?" He ran to Chief of Staff Zhang and said.

"Be careful, don't touch the spring!"

The voice was so concerned and anxious. He didn't even think about what would happen in a moment, only remembering that he squatted down as soon as he ran to the bomb, grabbed one and ran towards the ditch edge, and threw it with a swing after only a few steps - until the wind-thunder bomb exploded in the ditch, he realized that he had even forgotten to lie down. Everyone was anxiously shouting from afar: "Lie down! Lie down!"

Feeling a burst of tension in his heart, he ran to the second one. The bomb was half buried in the soil, with four wind vanes stretched outwards on top, and a slender firing pin standing upright in the middle. These things would explode with the slightest touch, and he had to use his fingers to dig away the soil around the bomb. He crawled on the ground and gently dug, knelt up, grabbed it and ran out again. There was no echo when the bomb was thrown into the ditch. By this time, his clothes were already soaked. The third one was mostly buried in the soil. He crawled to it and started digging again. Half of the wind vanes had already fallen off, making it even more impossible to shake, but just as he was digging, a Korean People's Army soldier suddenly came and grabbed the bomb in a few strokes. The surrounding people and the sound of the explosion in the ditch burst into cheers. They threw Zhao Liangxuan into the air.

"Looking back now," Zhao Liangxuan said, "I was anxious at the time, but I was always calculating in my mind. I threw the middle one first, probably because it was the most obstructive. Even if it went off on the spot, the cars could still drive past the other two. It wouldn't have been a wasted death. Also, the firing pin won't go off unless it's pushed in. I grabbed it and clenched my fist tightly, just to grab the firing pin tightly at the root, and restrain the wind vanes, so that the spring wouldn't shrink back."

Strong people are always like this: they are not only courageous enough to sacrifice themselves, but also good at seizing every possibility of defeating the enemy in danger. Although, in retrospect, they often don't even understand why they were able to think of so much in that moment. When he drove the car to the front, unloaded the ammunition, and then returned empty along the original road, the intersection was already blazing with fire. It was the nearby houses that were burning. Chief of Staff Zhang told him: the blocked cars had just left not long ago, and the enemy planes came to bomb.

"Be a good Chinese," this is a painful sentence that his eldest brother often said. Zhao Liangxuan is from Shenyang, a truck driver for a local product company. His eldest brother had been captured by the Japanese invaders to be a forced laborer and went down to the coal mine. He was buried alive in the coal mine with more than a hundred people. "If it hadn't been for the desperate rescue of the Communist Party's underground workers, my life would have been over long ago." Whenever he thought of being a slave without a country, he thought of the living hell in the coal mine, and whenever he thought of the Chinese people, he thought of the Communist Party, who risked their lives to save people. Recently, he also wrote in a letter: "When you return victoriously in the future, you will not only have saved the Koreans, but also the Chinese, and me." He regarded the Communist Party as a good example of the Chinese people. Zhao Liangxuan said:

"Before I went abroad, my second brother, third brother, and sister had all joined the revolution a long time ago. My eldest brother is a small businessman who is getting older, and he also wants to work in the cooperative. I had typhoid fever and lay in bed for two years, and everything had changed from the country to my home. I was the first in the company to sign up to join the volunteer motorcade, but my eldest brother still couldn't let go of his worries. Once, when I returned home to perform a mission, he rushed to Andong overnight to see me, and the first thing he said was:

"'How's it going? Have you joined?'"

"I said, 'I haven't disgraced the motherland,' and he was so happy that tears welled up in his eyes and said: 'Do a good job in Korea, strive to join the party, and be a good Chinese!' Hearing this sentence in the motherland doesn't feel like much, but it's different when you go abroad: Using rifles and grenades to defeat American planes, artillery, and automatic guns - this is what the Chinese people have done; foot soldiers with two legs have caught up with mechanized cars, tanks, and armored vehicles - this is what the Chinese people have done; one call to resist America and aid Korea, and cars, carts, and handcarts filled to the brim have been pouring across the river day and night. The things we eat come from the fields, from the trees, from the sky, from the land, from the sea… China's peaceful construction has only been going on for a year, and even the Hami melons from Xinjiang are resisting America and aiding Korea - isn't this also what the Chinese people are doing! We are all people of the great motherland, so why can't our cars fight against American planes?"

He then talked about the following experience.

Night. Flares were shining in the sky not far away: more than twenty were thrown in a long row at once, and they hung in the low sky for three or four minutes, arranged in circles, cross flowers, and long strings. At a glance, there were seventy or eighty of them, lighting up the open fields for dozens of miles as if it were daytime. When they were about to go out, new ones were added.

This was the climax of the enemy planes' "hanging lights" to block the road. The planes' red and green marker lights circled and moved back and forth overhead, as many as fourteen of them. Four cars were burning in front, stopped on the other side of a dark bridge.

The temporarily repaired Jiang Bridge was narrow and crooked, still in the shadows. The assistant stopped the car. The bridge was difficult to cross, and the other side was the center of the enemy plane's blockade zone, with explosions and red bullets flashing there.

But new flares were being thrown this way, and the enemy planes would not let this bridge go. If they didn't cross it early, they wouldn't be able to cross it tonight. "I'll drive!" Zhao Liangxuan took the steering wheel and drove towards the Jiang Bridge.

The burning cars were in front of him, the flames dazzling, and he couldn't see the bridge. Enemy planes dived towards the flames again.

The flares were shining diagonally. The plane skimmed overhead. After a burst of whistling, Zhao Liangxuan simply turned on the headlights and drove onto the bridge.

The lights illuminated the Jiang Bridge brightly, and the bridge planks roared and bounced under his feet - in a thrilling moment, the car rushed across the bridge, and the whistling sound of the enemy plane's dive also rushed into his head.

The burning cars had already flashed to the side. The assistant pushed open the car door and jumped out, but Zhao Liangxuan grabbed his belt.

He held the belt in one hand and the steering wheel in the other, slammed the lights off, and opened the throttle, driving forward.

In the center of the flare area, there were unmanned cars on the road. The surrounding area was a vast open plain. He suddenly thought of the cars that had been sitting there taking hits during the day, and the speed increased even more: he sped along the illuminated road, bypassing the cars parked on the road, zigzagging and running through the gaps, and in one breath, he drove more than a hundred miles, bringing over a full truckload of shells. Several cars followed and rushed out.

"Shells are closer than my dad!" Zhao Liangxuan said, "At that time, could I just leave them on the road and let the enemy planes line up and aim? The first time I encountered flares, I just felt that everything was brightly lit, and I couldn't even find a place to hide. But, gritting my teeth and running, I also saw through the enemy's tricks! The enemy planes are above the light, and we are below the light. It's like looking at people through a light bulb, how can they see clearly? If a car in front is hit, the flames will make it impossible to see the bridge. Can they aim at us accurately through dozens of bright flares! No matter how many tricks the enemy has, they can't beat our tenacity; grit your teeth in the face of difficulties and you'll have a solution."

After a year of tenacious struggle, a doggerel appeared on the Korean battlefield: "Truman, what a bear; hanging lanterns on his head, four-legged nails all over the ground, and timed bombs too, blasting big holes in the road. There are new tricks every day, but it's all in vain. The volunteer motorcade still moves forward." After the enemy's tricks were all bankrupted one by one, the volunteer army drivers, who were originally ordinary workers, also became strong internationalist fighters. Zhao Liangxuan said: "When I first went abroad, I would drive for nights on end, and I always felt like I didn't get enough sleep. I could even fall asleep with my eyes open." In order to cheer up, the drivers used to wipe their faces with snow, use ice to cushion their heads, or stop the car and run around the car a few times, shouting a few times, to wake up before driving forward. But they would still often drive into the ditch with their eyes open. At that time, they often thought, when will I be able to sleep for three days and three nights, and not wake up even if a bomb falls. "But now that the cars have a home, I can't sleep anymore: four or five hours of sleep a day is enough. If the United States continues to act recklessly, I will accompany it to the end. Being able to be a decent Chinese person, this life won't be in vain!"

    好好做个中国人
    新华社记者  华山
    好马是跑出来的，好钢是炼出来的，夜行千里的汽车司机是和敌机搏斗出来的。
    从下午三四点准备出车到第二天早上七八点收车进洞，汽车第五连整宿都在忙着。只有白天的睡觉时间比较安静。我正在连部抽空整理笔记，门口来了个披着羊皮大衣的青年。
    “怎么不睡啦？”连长说，“什么事情？”
    “没啥。来换个电嘴。”
    “这点子事情，吃过晚饭再换不行？不到下一点又爬起来了。老不好好睡觉。”
    “早睡够了。足足睡了四个钟头。”
    “那就坐下谈谈吧。”连长说。大概，他们也和我一年来所碰到过的志愿军司机那样，每天睡上四五个钟头就完全满足了。连长给我介绍：
    “这就是赵亮宣，扫除风雷弹的。”
    崇敬的心情陡然涌上心头：就是他啊！二十一岁的青年，清瘦的中等个子，眼坑微红，发粘的睫毛半垂着，眼睛里不时射出锋利的光芒。——当他谈到这件事情的时候，过度疲劳的脸上也光亮起来了：
    “要不是敌机在头上逼着，我也不会动手干的。”赵亮宣说。那是去年六月二十九日下午四点多钟的事情。那时候敌机的滥炸政策正在劲头上。他满载着一大卡车的雷管，开上前方，本来是想在天黑以前抢过十字路口，钻空子横过封锁线的。路口却塞满了四路汽车。
    三颗风雷弹躺在当中，张着翅膀，正好在路上排成一排，汽车从那里过都得碰响一颗。同样的十几颗也在公路附近散乱着，绕不过去。
    这是敌机每晚必然轰炸扫射的公路交叉点。交通指挥所的张参谋长急的亲到跟前想法排除。大伙用枪打，没打炸；用火烧，没烧炸；在两头拉起一根长长的草绳，想把它拨到路边，炸弹没动草绳先断了。三十几个人没法对付，工兵一时又赶不来，周围的汽车却越来越多了。
    赵亮宣的汽车满载雷管，自己在路上跑着还是怕颠怕碰的，何况堵在车群中间，等着挨打呢？路口几十台汽车的弹药物资，送到了前方就够敌人饱吃一顿的，如果毁在这里，白搭上人命汽车还要堵塞交通，前方也捞不着用了。只是茶碗大的三颗小炸弹，就能把四路汽车堵死，多欺负人！赵亮宣又急又气，越气越急，夜间轰炸机又在远处嗡嗡响了。
    “能不能用手扔？”他跑到张参谋长跟前说。
    “要小心，别碰弹簧！”
    声音是这样地关切而焦急，他连想也没想到顷刻之后会发生什么事情，只记得自己一跑到炸弹跟前就蹲了下去，抓起一颗就向沟沿跑，没跑几步就抡手一扔——直到风雷弹在沟里爆炸以后，他才发觉自己连卧倒也忘记了。大伙只急的远远嚷着：“爬下！爬下！”
    心里一阵紧张，他又跑到第二颗跟前。炸弹半埋在土里，四叶风翅在上头挺挺地朝外伸张着，细长的撞针在中间朝天竖着。这些玩意，一碰就响，还得用手指把炸弹周围的土掏开。他爬在地上轻轻掏着，跪起身来，一把抓住又往外跑。炸弹扔到沟里没有回声。这时，他浑身的衣服却早已湿透了。第三颗在土里埋着大半，他爬到跟前又动手掏。风翅已经碰掉一半，更加震荡不得，可是正在掏着的时候，跟前突然来了个朝鲜人民军战士，几下子就把炸弹抓走了。周围的人和沟里的爆炸声一起欢腾起来，他们把赵亮宣抛到天空。
    “现在回想起来，”赵亮宣说，“当时急是急，心里总是一直在盘算着的。我先扔中间那颗，准是看它最碍事，那怕当场把它碰响，汽车也能从其余两颗中间开过去，没算白死了。还有那撞针，不往里戳总响不了，我一把抓住就捏紧拳头，就是为的把撞针齐根抓紧，蹩住风翅，不让弹簧往回缩。”
    坚强的人总是这样的：他不仅勇于牺牲，而且善于在危险中抓住每一个战胜敌人的可能。虽然事后回想起来，常常连自己也不了解：为什么那一瞬间能够想到这许多。当他把汽车开到前方，卸下弹药，又顺着原路放空回来，这时，路口已经呼呼地冒着大火。那是附近的房子在燃烧着。张参谋长告诉他：堵塞的汽车刚刚开走不久，敌机就来轰炸了。
    “好好做个中国人，”这是他的大哥经常说起的一句沉痛的话。赵亮宣是沈阳人，一个土产公司的汽车司机。大哥曾经被日寇抓过劳工，下过煤窑，和一百多人一起被活活地砸在煤洞里。“要不是共产党的地下工作人员拚命抢救，我这一辈子早完了。”一想起亡国奴他就想到煤洞子里的活地狱，想起中国人就想到舍命救人的共产党。最近他来信还说：“将来你胜利归来，不仅救了朝鲜人，也救了中国人，救了我。”他是把共产党看做中国人的好榜样的。赵亮宣说：
    “出国以前，我二哥，三哥，妹妹都老早参加革命了，大哥是个上了年纪的小商人，也要到合作社去工作。我害伤寒病在床上躺了两年，从国到家都变了样了。我在公司第一个报名参加志愿汽车队，大哥还是放不下心。有一次我回国执行任务，他就连夜赶到安东看我，头一句就说：
    “‘干的怎么样？参加了没有？’”
    “我说了声‘没给祖国丢脸’，他只乐得冒出眼泪来说：‘在朝鲜好好干，争取入党，好好做个中国人！’这句话，在祖国听着还不怎的，一出国就不同了：拿步枪、手榴弹打败了美国飞机、大炮、自动枪，——这是中国人干出来的；两条腿的步兵追上了机械化的汽车、战车、装甲车，——这是中国人干出来的；一声抗美援朝，满登登的汽车、大车、手车就日夜不停地涌过江来，光是吃的就有地里种的，树上长的，天上飞的，地上爬的，海里游的，……祖国和平建设刚刚一年，连新疆的哈密瓜也抗美援朝了，——这不也是中国人干出来的！一样是伟大祖国的人民，为啥我们的汽车就斗不过美国飞机？”
    他于是谈起下面的一段经历。
    晚上。照明弹正在不远的天空闪耀着：一扔就是二十几颗一长排，一亮就在低空挂着三几分钟，排成圆形的，十字花的，一长串的，一眼看去就有七八十颗，只照得几十里的开阔原野如同白天那样。将要熄灭，新的又补上了。
    这是敌机“挂灯”封锁道路的高潮。飞机的红绿标灯在头顶来回盘旋游动，竟然有十四架那样多。四台汽车正在前面燃烧着，停在一道黑桥那边。
    临时修复的江桥，又窄又歪，还在黑影下。助手把车停下来了。桥不好过，那边又是敌机封锁区的中心，爆炸的火光和喷射的红色弹光就在那里闪着。
    可是新的照明弹正在往这边扔，敌机是不会放过这条桥的。不趁早过去，这一宿就别想过了。“我开！”赵亮宣接过舵轮，就向江桥驰去。
    燃烧的汽车迎面摆着，火光耀眼，看不见桥。敌机又向火光俯冲了。
    照明弹斜照着。飞机掠过头顶。一阵啸声过去，赵亮宣干脆打起大灯，开上桥去。
    灯光把江桥照的通明，桥板在脚下轰响蹦跳，——惊心动魄的一刹那，汽车一下子冲过桥去，敌机俯冲的啸声也冲向脑门。
    燃烧的汽车已经闪到旁边。助手推开车门，踪身就跳，叫赵亮宣一把纠住皮带了。
    他一手纠住皮带，一手把住舵轮，猛一闭灯就扳开快闸，向前猛开。
    照明弹的中心区，公路上扔着没人的车子。周围是一片开阔的大平原。他忽然想起白天停着挨打的汽车，速度也更加放快了：他在通明的公路上疾驰着，绕过停在路上的汽车，来回拐着钻空跑，一口气跑了一百多里，把满满的一大卡车的炮弹开了过来。好几台汽车也跟着冲出来了。
    “炮弹比我爹还亲啊！”赵亮宣说，“那时能扔在道上，让敌机摆好架势瞄准打吗？第一次碰到照明弹的时候，只觉得到处明晃晃的，简直连藏个身子的地方也找不到了。可是，硬着头皮一跑，也看透敌人的花样啦！敌机在亮光上面，我们在亮光下面，它看汽车就像隔着电灯看人那样，那能看得清楚呢？前面打着了台汽车，火光就能晃的眼睛看不见桥，它隔着几十颗明晃晃的照明弹就能看准咱啦！敌人的花样再多，也斗不过我们一个顽强；在困难面前一咬牙又有了办法了。”
    经过了一年的顽强斗争以后，朝鲜战场出现了一首打油诗：“杜鲁门，真是熊；头上挂灯笼，满地四脚钉，还有定时弹，公路炸大坑。花样天天有，就是白操心，志愿汽车团，照样向前进。”等到敌人的花样一个个的全都破产以后，普通工人出身的志愿军司机们也锻炼成坚强的国际主义战士了。赵亮宣说：“刚出国的时候，一宿宿的开着汽车，总觉得觉不够睡，瞪着眼也能睡着了。”为了振奋精神，那时司机们曾经用雪擦脸，用冰垫头，或者停下车来，围着汽车猛跑几圈，猛喊几声，清醒过来再开车前进。可是还常常瞪着眼睛开到沟里。那时常常想，什么时候能睡他三天三宿，炸弹落下来也不起床啦。“可是现在汽车有了家，反而睡不着了：一天睡四五个钟头就够用的。美国有种蛮干下去，我就陪它打到底。能够做个像样的中国人，这辈子也不算白活啦！”
