Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 15th: At the Korean armistice negotiations' third agenda item staff meeting on the 15th, the other side continued to unreasonably insist on a huge number of military personnel rotations and the number of specific rear ports. Our staff personnel pointed out: The rotation limit of 30,000 people per month proposed by our side has in fact exceeded actual needs, and it is absolutely not allowed to stipulate an excessively high rotation limit, which would fundamentally eliminate the practical significance of this limit. The number of military personnel, weapons, and ammunition entering Korea after the cessation of hostilities should be greatly reduced, and the four specific rear ports proposed by our side also fully meet any legitimate needs. Our side once again suggested that the other side seriously consider and accept our side's reasonable solutions to the main differences between the two sides.

At the fourth agenda item staff meeting, the two sides continued to exchange opinions based on the revised draft proposed by our side on February 14th. Our staff personnel reviewed the successive proposals of the two sides, explaining that when drafting any clause, our side did its best to adopt the other side's opinions and seek provisions and wording that would satisfy both sides, in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible. The revised draft of our side on February 14th has in fact adopted many of the other side's opinions and wording. Our side has made great efforts, but the other side only creates excuses and obstacles first, and then removes the excuses and obstacles they created themselves, and then claim that it is their effort and concession. Our staff personnel further pointed out: To promote the progress of the meeting, the other side must seriously consider our side's reasonable plan and abandon its absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation."

    朝鲜谈判第三、第四项议程参谋会议上
    我方再次要美方郑重考虑我方合理方案
    【新华社开城十五日电】十五日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，对方仍然无理地坚持庞大的军事人员轮换数字和特定后方口岸的数目。我方参谋人员指出：我方所提出的每月三万人的轮换限额，事实上已超过了实际需要，决不容许规定过高的轮换限额，而根本取消了这一限额的实际意义。敌对行为终止以后进入朝鲜的军事人员和武器弹药的数量，应有大量的削减，我方所提出的每方四个特定后方口岸也充分地满足了任何正当的需要。我方再次建议对方郑重考虑，并接受我方对于双方主要分歧的合理解决方案。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方根据我方二月十四日所提修正草案继续交换意见。我方参谋人员回溯了双方迭次的提案，说明我方起草任何条款时，都尽最大可能采纳对方意见，寻取可以使双方都满意的规定和措辞，以期尽早达成协议。我方二月十四日的修正草案，事实上已采纳了对方的许多意见和措辞。我方已作了很大的努力，但对方只是先制造藉口，制造障碍，然后撤除其自己制造的藉口和障碍，便自称是他们的努力和让步。我方参谋人员进一步指出：要推动会议的进展，对方必须郑重考虑我方合理方案，放弃其“自愿遣送”的荒谬主张。
