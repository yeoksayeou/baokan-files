Is it "Behind Closed Doors" and "Wall Gazing" or Facing the Masses?
		Ji Chuyang

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, some university teachers felt very upset because they were criticized by students and colleagues. Some said, "There are many ways to correct mistakes. 'Thinking behind closed doors' is also an option. Why must we be criticized or make public self-criticisms in front of the masses?" Others didn't say it, but they thought so in their hearts.

This is a question of understanding criticism and self-criticism. It reminds me of a story: Once upon a time, there was a Bodhidharma "patriarch" who "attained enlightenment and became a Buddha" after "gazing at a wall for nine years" in the Shaolin Temple on Mount Song. We are not monks and have never put in the effort to cultivate and meditate in this way, so we don't know if "gazing at a wall for nine years" can really lead to "enlightenment and Buddhahood." But I am also reminded of an old saying: "Close the door and block the holes." According to the explanation, a hole is a small opening. So, in today's language, it could also be said that "closing the door to block the gaps and plug the loopholes" won't work.

But should we "reflect behind closed doors" and wait for "sudden enlightenment," or should we face the masses, listen to opinions, accept criticism, or make public self-criticisms?

A certain department in a certain university has an experience to share. It is said that this department used to be a case of "one teacher, one mountain stronghold," where meetings were filled with "you saying your thing, and I saying my thing," engaging in infighting and mutual attacks, causing disunity and seriously affecting teaching work. However, because they held a department-wide meeting of teachers and students, publicly exposed these mistakes in front of the masses, and correctly carried out criticism and self-criticism, the result was greatly increased unity within the department, laying a good foundation for its development. The reason is simple: they used the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to open everyone's "door," tear down everyone's "wall," and bring the problems out into the open. Instead of idealistically "reflecting behind closed doors," "gazing at a wall for nine years," or self-deceptively "closing the door to block the holes."

Some teachers say, "My heart jumps when I hear others being criticized." Others say, "If I have to make a self-criticism at 2:00 PM, I'll start shivering at 10:00 AM!" This seems like a physiological or psychological problem. In reality, these people lack the courage to face the masses and confront their shortcomings. They have not fully realized that: Without conducting principled criticism and self-criticism in front of the masses, it is impossible to overcome our mistakes and shortcomings in our work; Without waging a correct struggle on the ideological front, it is impossible to eliminate the corrupt bourgeois ideology that remains in or has infected us; Without cultivating ourselves in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, we cannot talk about ideological transformation and truly growing and moving forward!

    是“闭门”“面壁”呢？还是面向群众？
    纪初阳
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动里，有些高等学校教师因为受到了同学和同事的批评，心里很难过，于是有的便说：“改正错误的方法很多，‘闭门思过’也可以，为什么一定要在群众面前来批评或作公开检讨？”还有的是嘴里不这样说，但心里是这样想。
    这是对待批评和自我批评的认识问题。想起一个故事来：从前有一个达摩“祖师”，因为在嵩山少林寺“面壁九年”，终于“悟道成佛”。我们不是和尚，也没有下过这种修道、参禅的工夫，所以是不是“面壁九年”就能够“悟道成佛”呢？不了解。但又想起一句古话来：是“闭门塞窦”。照解释，窦是孔穴，所以如用今天的话来讲，那意思也可以说就是“关着门来堵空子和塞漏洞”那是塞不住的。
    但到底是应该“闭门思过”，等待“一旦觉悟”呢？还是应该面向群众、听取意见、接受批评或作公开检讨呢？
    某高等学校某系有一个经验。据说，这个系过去是“一个教师，一座山头”，开会时“你说你的一套，我说我的一套”，勾心斗角，互相打击，闹得四分五裂，严重地影响了教学工作。但由于他们开了一次全系师生大会，在群众面前公开地揭露了这些错误，正确地展开了批评和自我批评，结果是大大地增进了系里的团结，并且给系的发展打下一个很好的基础。原因也很简单，是因为他们用批评和自我批评的武器，打开了每个人的“门”，拆掉了每个人的“墙”，把问题摆到了桌面上来。而不是唯心地“闭门思过”“面壁九年”，和自欺欺人地“闭门塞窦”。
    有的教师说：“我一听到别人受批评心就跳。”还有的教师说：“如果让我下午两点钟检讨，我上午十点便要打哆嗦了！”这又仿佛是一个生理问题或心理问题了。其实是这些人还没有面向群众和正视缺点的勇气。他们仍没有充分地认识到：不在群众面前展开原则性的批评和自我批评，就不可能克服我们在工作上的错误和缺点；不在思想战线上展开正确的斗争，那遗留在或传染到我们身上的资产阶级的腐朽思想就不可能除掉；不在批评和自我批评的精神下来培养自己，那我们就谈不到思想改造和真正地生长和前进！
