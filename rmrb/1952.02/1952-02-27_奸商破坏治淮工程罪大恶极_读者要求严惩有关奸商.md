    Profiteers Sabotage Huai River Project, Heinous Crime
    Readers Demand Severe Punishment for Relevant Profiteers
    To the Editor: The nine timber firms in Nanjing, Yida, Jingcheng, Taicheng, Tailai, Xiangji, Yongcheng, Juyuan, Huachang, and Yufeng, colluded with cadres of the Huai River Project Bureau to sabotage the Huai River Project. This behavior is, in essence, the same as the crime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in 1938 when they breached the Yellow River into the Huai River, causing years of disaster for the people on both banks of the Huai River. Although we have driven the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang out of our mainland, we still have vivid memories of their crimes. In order to realize Chairman Mao's great call to "definitely harness the Huai River well," we must not tolerate these profiteers—who can be said to be agents of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—attacking us in secret again and destroying our peaceful and happy life. We hope that the Nanjing Municipal People's Court will give the most severe punishment to Dai Yunxiao, the person in charge of the extremely sinful Yida Timber Firm, Zhao Songtao, the manager of Jingcheng Timber Firm, and the broker Song Shikang, who have already been arrested, and also punish other profiteers involved in this case according to the law.

    奸商破坏治淮工程罪大恶极
    读者要求严惩有关奸商
    编辑同志：南京市益大、竞成、泰成、泰来、祥记、永成、钜源、华昌、裕丰等九家木行奸商，勾结治淮工程局干部，破坏治淮工程。这种行为，和蒋匪帮一九三八年掘黄入淮，造成淮河两岸人民连年灾难的罪行，实质上是一样的。我们虽然已经把蒋匪帮赶出我国的大陆，但我们对于它的罪行，仍然是记忆犹新的。我们为了实现毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召，决不能容忍这些奸商——可以说是蒋匪帮的代理人——再来暗中向我们进攻，破坏我们和平幸福的生活。我们希望南京市人民法院给已经逮捕的罪大恶极的益大木行负责人戴云啸、竞成木行经理赵松涛及掮客宋世康三犯以最严厉的惩罚，对于和这一案有关的其他奸商，也要依法惩办。
