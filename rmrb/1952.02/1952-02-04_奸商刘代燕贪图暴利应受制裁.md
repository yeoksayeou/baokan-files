    Profiteer Liu Daiyan Deserves Sanctions for Seeking Excessive Profits

    To the Editor: The unscrupulous merchant Liu Daiyan is the manager of Yansheng Printing Factory. Over the past year, he has engaged in various forms of deception during transactions with a certain department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, obtaining many illegal profits. Last February, the department entrusted him with printing various forms and asked him to purchase 100 reams of 60-pound Grade B book paper, paying over 80 million yuan for printing and paper costs. Liu bought 81 reams of book paper at 410,000 yuan per ream, but he sold it to the department at 480,000 yuan per ream, profiting millions of yuan with a simple gesture. On one occasion, the department asked him to buy 6 reams of 80-pound security paper, and he replaced more than 1,800 sheets of it with 80-pound Taiyuan Daolin paper. In this way, he obtained another illegal profit of more than 800,000 yuan. There are many other examples of overreporting labor costs and overestimating costs. In short, he is an unscrupulous merchant who seeks excessive profits by any means. When the department sent people to check the accounts, he even claimed that the reason for the unclear accounts was a confused mind, attempting to muddle through. This behavior should be sanctioned.

    奸商刘代燕贪图暴利应受制裁
    编辑同志：奸商刘代燕是燕生印刷厂的经理。一年来，他和人民革命军事委员会某部进行交易时，多方进行欺骗，取得很多非法利润。去年二月，某部委托他印各种表册，并要他代买六十磅乙种书籍纸一百令，共付印费和纸费八千多万元。刘买进书籍纸八十一令，每令价四十一万，而他卖给某部，却每令作价四十八万元，举手之间，就获利数百万元。有一次，某部托他买八十磅证券纸六令，他把其中一千八百多张换了八十磅的太原道林纸。这样，他又取得非法利润八十多万元。其他在多报人工、估高成本方面的例子很多。总之，他是一个不择手段贪图暴利的奸商。当某部派人去查对时，他还说账目不清的原因是头脑糊涂，妄想混蒙过去。这种行为应受到制裁。    黄俭
