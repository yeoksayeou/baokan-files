    Tianjin Brick and Tile Kiln Industry Profiteering Merchants Organized Monopoly Group
    Manipulating Brick and Tile Production and Squeezing out Publicly Operated Kilns
    Lead Profiteering Merchant Wang Wenke and Others Have Been Arrested and Brought to Justice
    In Tianjin, the brick and tile kiln industry, led by major profiteering merchants such as Wang Wenke, Jin Wenhuan, and Li Fenglai, used joint operations as a cover to organize a monopoly group, control and manipulate the brick and tile market, openly undermine the Common Program, resist the leadership of the state-owned economy, and launch a frenzied attack on the state and the people in an organized and planned manner. The serious illegal acts of these profiteers have been exposed in the anti-bribery struggle, and the leading profiteer Wang Wenke and others have been arrested and brought to justice.
    Before liberation, the Tianjin brick and tile kiln industry was on its last breath due to the devastation caused by the Kuomintang bandit gang. After liberation, the People's Government used great effort to support the opening of production in various kilns. The cooperative department of the People's Bank issued four loans in 1949 alone, saving the dying brick and tile kiln industry and restoring it. Just as the production of the brick and tile industry was beginning to improve and its feathers were gradually becoming full, the major profiteer Wang Wenke used his position as chairman of the trade association to organize a monopoly group. He used the opportunity of issuing government support loans to win over the kilns in the entire industry to his side, so that they would obey his commands. The production and sale of bricks from each factory had to go through him. Then, Wang Wenke colluded with profiteering merchants Jin Wenhuan, Li Fenglai, and others, and under the guise of organizing joint operations, formed a monopoly group—the Brick and Tile Joint Operations Cooperative—and began to attack the state and the people with ingratitude.
    They first used methods such as treating to meals and bribery to "pull over" Feng Huamin, the business director of the cooperative department of the Tianjin branch of the People's Bank, and a deputy manager surnamed Gu, in order to facilitate their fraudulent acquisition of loans. In a fixed-order loan at the end of 1949, the profiteers used the method of falsely reporting costs to steal 2.6 billion yuan in one instance. Subsequently, using the same method, they stole another 2.4 billion yuan in the sale of 15 million bricks to the North China Textile Administration Bureau. Wang Wenke, Jin Wenhuan, and other profiteering merchants used the name of industry joint operations to take these two huge sums of money they had stolen to buy grain in the Northeast, coal in Datong, and flour in Wuxi, engaging in illegal operations and evading a large amount of national taxes. At that time, there was a large price difference between grain inside and outside the customs, and the Northeast prohibited private merchants from transporting grain into the customs. Wang Wenke and others colluded with Shen Shiying, a cadre of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and introduced Shen's brother to the Brick and Tile Kiln Industry Trade Association as a clerk, giving Shen a house in exchange. As a result, Shen Shiying found a way to obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Trade using an official letter from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, so that the profiteers could transport 1.7 million catties of corn from the Northeast, buying it for more than 300 yuan per catty and selling it for more than 700 yuan per catty, making a lot of money.
    After the strength of this monopoly group grew, it even more frantically attacked state-owned economic departments, attempting to break away from the track of the New Democratic economy and develop a capitalist economic system. For example, in the spring of 1951, as there were more and more construction projects in various places, the Tianjin branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company hoped to sign a sales contract with the brick and tile kilns in order to coordinate the supply and sales of bricks and tiles. They contacted them several times, but were rejected by Wang Wenke and others. These profiteers reached out to the Tianjin branch of the People’s Bank for loans, while also connecting with private banks and firms, depositing funds into private banks and firms for interest, especially each time they sold goods, they would ask private banks and firms to set up temporary offices in the Brick and Tile Kiln Industry Trade Association to accept deposits from various kilns.
    The monopoly group of profiteers Wang Wenke, Jin Wenhuan, Zhou Zhenhua, and others—the Brick and Tile Joint Operations Cooperative—repeatedly used monopolistic methods to manipulate brick and tile market prices. As early as 1949, Wang Wenke, Jin Wenhuan, and others used loans from the People's Bank to win over the industry; at the same time, they instructed some Philistines in the brick and tile kiln industry who did not have kilns to rent six or seven kilns from the Public Enemy Property Management Bureau. In this way, they controlled the entire brick and tile kiln industry in Tianjin, monopolizing the city's brick production and prices. All construction projects had to ask them to purchase goods. They could ask for as much money as they wanted, and they would get it. In 1949, they seized illegal profits that were nearly twice as high as production costs. In May 1950, these profiteers repeatedly "suggested" to the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce: "The production and sales of bricks and tiles in Tianjin have reached a balance, do not approve new businesses to open." That spring, a few newly built public kilns (which had not joined the trade association and had not participated in joint operations) sold some bricks on the market at low prices. After Wang, Jin, and other profiteers discovered this, they used the name of the trade association to publish large advertisements in newspapers, publicizing that the trade association was selling 20 million red bricks at low prices, squeezing the bricks and tiles of public kilns out of the market. Afterwards, the major profiteer Wang Wenke even boasted: "The annual brick production of several public kilns does not exceed 15 million bricks. We threw out 20 million bricks, and we can beat them back all at once."
    In name, the Brick and Tile Joint Operations Cooperative was composed of 88 kilns in the entire brick and tile kiln industry, but in reality, all the power was completely controlled by a few major profiteers such as Wang Wenke, Jin Wenhuan, and Li Fenglai. This group of profiteers stole state assets on the one hand and oppressed small kiln factories on the other. Whether it was loans or selling goods, they monopolized the profits. In 1950, when a certain military project was being built, the quantity of bricks needed was very large. Li Fenglai, the manager of the Joint Operations Cooperative, claimed: "The needs of military projects should be supplied first, and no one is allowed to sell bricks privately." However, soon after, the price of bricks rose, and he himself was the first to sell bricks privately in large quantities. Later, he was seen by small brick and tile kiln owners, who filed a complaint with the government. He then tried to win over the small owners, on the condition that all the broken and old bricks that the small owners had left over for many years would be sold to the construction site, thus shutting the mouths of the small owners. This caused great losses to the military project. In addition, from 1949 to the first half of 1951, they controlled the transportation of bricks and tiles, deducting a total of 1.8 billion yuan in freight.
    In the movement against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets, the head of this monopoly group, the major profiteer Wang Wenke and others, still refused to confess and have been arrested and brought to justice by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government.

    天津砖瓦窑业奸商组织垄断集团
    操纵砖瓦生产排挤公营窑厂
    为首的大奸商王文科等已被逮捕法办
    天津市砖瓦窑业以王文科、金文焕、李凤来等为首的大奸商拿联营作掩护，组织垄断集团，把持、操纵砖瓦市场，公然破坏共同纲领，抗拒国营经济的领导，有组织、有计划地向国家和人民猖狂进攻。这批奸商们严重的犯法行为，在反行贿斗争中已被揭露，为首的大奸商王文科等已被逮捕法办。
    解放前的天津砖瓦窑业，在国民党匪帮的摧残下，早已奄奄一息了。解放以后，人民政府曾用很大力量，扶植各窑厂开工生产。人民银行合作部仅在一九四九年就先后发放了四次贷款，把奄奄一息的砖瓦窑业挽救复苏。就在砖瓦业生产刚刚好转、羽毛渐渐丰满的时候，大奸商王文科就利用同业公会主任委员的职位，组织垄断集团。他利用发放政府的扶助贷款的机会，把全行业各窑厂都拉拢在他的周围，听从他的指挥。各厂户生产和向外卖砖都得通过他的手。接着，王文科就勾结了奸商金文焕、李凤来等，以组织联营为名，组成了垄断集团——砖瓦联营社，开始忘恩负义地向国家和人民进攻。
    他们首先用请吃饭、行贿等方法，把人民银行天津分行合作部营业主任冯化民和一个姓谷的副经理“拉过去”，以便利他们骗取贷款。在一九四九年末一笔定货贷款中，奸商运用虚报成本的办法，一次就盗窃了二十六亿元。随后又运用同样方式，在卖给华北纺织管理局的一千五百万块砖中，又盗窃了二十四亿元。王文科、金文焕等奸商就用同业联营的名义，拿盗窃的这两笔巨款分头到东北买粮食，到大同买煤，到无锡买面粉，从事非法经营，大量偷漏国税。当时，关内外粮价悬殊，东北禁止私商运粮进关。王文科等就拉拢天津市工商局的干部沈士英，把沈的哥哥介绍到砖瓦窑业同业公会作庶务，给沈顶兑房子住。结果，由沈士英想办法用工商局公函向贸易部要到证明，奸商得以把一百七十万斤玉米从东北运了回来，三百多元一斤买来的，七百多元一斤卖了出去，捞了一大笔钱。
    这个垄断集团的势力壮大起来以后，就更加猖狂地向国营经济部门进攻，妄图脱出新民主主义经济的轨道，发展资本主义的经济制度。如一九五一年春，各地修建工程日多，中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司为了统筹调配砖瓦的供销，希望和砖瓦窑业订立包销合同，接洽过好几次，都被王文科等拒绝了。这些奸商一面伸手向人民银行天津分行合作部贷款；一面却和私营行庄拉上关系，把款存入私营行庄生息，特别是每次卖了货时，就叫私营行庄在砖瓦窑业同业公会设立临时办事处，接受各窑厂的存款。
    王文科、金文焕、周镇华等奸商的垄断集团——砖瓦联营社，曾一再利用垄断的方式，操纵砖瓦市场价格。早在一九四九年，王文科、金文焕等就利用人民银行的贷款笼络同业；同时指使砖瓦窑业中某些没有窑厂的市侩，租了公逆产清管局的六七家窑厂。这样，他们就把持了整个天津市的砖瓦窑业，垄断了全市砖的生产和价格。凡修建工程，都得求他们购货。他们要多少钱，就得给多少钱。一九四九年他们攫取了高出生产成本将近两倍的非法利润。一九五零年五月，这些奸商曾数度向市工商局“建议”：“现在天津市砖瓦业产销已达平衡，不要批准新户开业。”当年春天，有少数新建的公营窑厂（没有加入同业公会，也没有参加联营）在市场低价出售一部分砖。王、金等奸商发觉后，便用同业公会名义在报纸上大登广告，宣传同业公会廉价抛售红砖两千万块，把公营窑厂的砖瓦排挤出市场。事后，大奸商王文科还吹嘘说：“公营几家窑厂全年产砖超不过一千五百万块，咱们抛出去两千万块，一下子就能把他们给打回去。”
    在名义上，砖瓦联营社是整个砖瓦窑业八十八个窑厂所组成的，而实际上一切大权完全操在王文科、金文焕、李凤来等少数大奸商手中。这群奸商一方面盗窃国家资财，一方面欺压小户窑厂，不论是贷款或是卖货，都由他们垄断牟利。一九五零年修建某项军事工程，需砖数量很大，联营社经理李凤来声称：“应首先供应军事工程需要，谁也不许私卖砖。”但是不久砖价上涨，他自己首先大量私卖砖，后被砖瓦窑业小户看见，向政府提出控告。他又设法拉拢小户，以把小户多年来残存的破砖旧砖全部卖给工地为条件，堵住了小户的嘴。这样，给军事工程造成很大损失。另外，他们自一九四九年到一九五一年前半年，把持砖瓦的运输，共克扣运费十八亿元。
    在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财运动中，这一垄断集团首脑大奸商王文科等仍拒不坦白，已被天津市人民政府捕获法办。
