    [Report from this newspaper] Following the issuance of the State Council of the Central People's Government's decision on vigorously launching a mass campaign for drought prevention and resistance, North China provinces have taken various emergency measures and are actively taking action. Production and drought prevention offices at the provincial level have been established in Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Chahar provinces. In Hebei Province, Li Ziguang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Fan Ruoyi, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, serve as the director and deputy director respectively, with secretarial, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, production and disaster relief, cooperative trade, and financial groups set up under the office. In Pingyuan Province, Sun Zhaohuan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, serves as the director of the office; Chahar Province maintains its existing disaster relief office while adding drought prevention content. Suiyuan Province is also in the process of establishing a production and drought prevention agency. Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces also issued instructions on the 15th and 16th of this month, requiring all special districts and counties to follow the central instructions, organize forces, and immediately begin work. On the 19th, Hebei Province convened a meeting of commissioners from ten special districts, where Ma Guorui, Acting Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, personally conveyed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of the Central People's Government on drought prevention, resistance, and spring plowing, and made specific arrangements. At the same time, Hebei Province has selected 150 cadres to form inspection teams, which will soon depart for various places to conduct in-depth inspections of drought prevention and spring plowing work. In order to further mobilize forces, Pingyuan Province convened a commissioner meeting on the 16th. Chahar and Suiyuan provinces are also preparing to convene province-wide drought prevention, disaster relief, and spring plowing conferences in the near future. Because the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is not currently being carried out at the district and village levels, district-level cadres in Shanxi Province who are concentrated in the county for study, except for those with major corruption offenses who will be dealt with in the county, will all end their studies before February 20 and return to the countryside. These cadres are being instructed by responsible comrades from the county on drought prevention and spring plowing, and will return to their posts within days to mobilize the masses and strive to do a good job in drought prevention and spring plowing, laying a solid foundation for a bumper harvest.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 19th. The production and disaster relief work in North China has achieved great success. Last year, North China suffered severe drought, and Pingyuan Province experienced floods. Some areas also experienced pests, frost, and freezing damage. In total, the affected farmland in North China last year was approximately 140 million mu, and the number of affected farmers exceeded 10 million. However, last winter, North China achieved great success in production and disaster relief work. Under the deep concern and correct instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, all localities were determined, started early, grasped the work tightly, concentrated great efforts on production and disaster relief work, and came up with many production methods. Therefore, all localities reversed the serious situation caused by the disaster in a short period of time and prevented the development of the disaster.
    Last winter, the central government and the people's governments of North China provinces allocated large quantities of grain and loans to launch water conservancy, transportation, afforestation, and other construction projects, using work-for-relief methods to provide disaster relief. Chahar has dug 12,000 wells, repaired more than 400 canals, and built more than 3,700 li of roads. Suiyuan has completed 41 canal construction projects. Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and other provinces have also mobilized more than 160,000 disaster victims to work in towns, cities, industrial and mining areas, combining disaster relief work with long-term construction. Sideline production and handicraft production in the disaster areas are more diverse and have better sales than in previous years. Hundreds of thousands of women in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces participated in textile production, earning an average of two to three jin of rice per person per day. Farmers in Chahar, Suiyuan, and other provinces, who had no work to do in previous winters, proposed the slogan "Do whatever you can, accumulate little by little" last winter, and winter production quickly developed. The income from sideline production in Chahar Province last winter was equivalent to 92 million jin of rice. Areas with good production not only solved the farmers' food shortage but also bought back large numbers of livestock and farm tools. In addition, all localities also carried out credit, free lending, and seed storage. However, there are still many shortcomings in the production and disaster relief work in various localities. First of all, the development of production and disaster relief work is uneven. Some areas paid attention to severely affected areas and relaxed their efforts in lightly affected areas; areas with superior production conditions did better, while areas with poor production conditions did worse; some areas focused on agricultural areas and relaxed their efforts in pastoral areas. In the leadership of disaster relief work, many areas have bureaucratic work styles, and the understanding of the disaster situation is very inaccurate, exaggerating or underestimating the disaster situation; when mobilizing disaster victims to engage in sideline production, there were only calls to action without specific leadership; there were delays, abuses, misappropriations, and even corruption and waste in the distribution of winter clothes, disaster relief grain, and loans. Based on the above situation, the party and government leading organs in North China have decided to strengthen leadership, conduct in-depth inspections, and resolutely correct existing problems to ensure the completion of drought prevention and disaster relief and spring plowing preparation work in the shortest possible time.

    对防旱抗旱春耕工作采取紧急措施
    华北各省成立生产防旱办公室
    去冬华北各地生产救灾工作有很大成绩
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱决定发布后，华北各省对防旱、抗旱已采取各种紧急措施，积极行动。河北、山西、平原、察哈尔四省省一级生产防旱办公室均已成立。河北省由中共河北省委秘书长李子光、河北省人民政府财政经济委员会副主任范若一分任正副主任，下设秘书、农林水利、生产救灾、合作贸易、财政金融等组。平原省由民政厅长孙照寰任办公室主任；察哈尔省仍维持已有的救灾办公室，增加防旱内容。绥远省也正在建立生产防旱机构。河北、平原、山西三省并在本月十五、十六两日先后发出指示，要求各专区和县，遵照中央指示，组织力量，即日开展工作。河北省在十九日召开了十个专区的专员会议，由中共河北省委代理书记马国瑞和省人民政府主席杨秀峰亲自传达了中共中央和中央人民政府政务院有关防旱抗旱和春耕的指示，并作具体布置。同时河北省已抽调干部一百五十人组成检查大队，即将出发赴各地深入检查防旱和春耕工作。平原省为了进一步动员力量，于十六日召开了一次专员会议。察哈尔、绥远也准备在最近召开全省规模的防旱、救灾、春耕会议。因为目前区、村级暂不开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，山西集中到县进行学习的区级干部，除有重大贪污行为者留县处理外，一律于二月二十日以前结束学习，回到农村。这些干部正由县的负责同志，传达有关防旱和春耕的指示，日内即将回到工作岗位，发动群众，为做好防旱、春耕，打好丰收基础而努力。

    【新华社十九日讯】华北区的生产救灾工作已有很大的成绩。去年，华北区的旱灾很重，平原省曾发生过水灾，好些地区并发生过虫、霜、冻等灾害。总计去年华北农田受灾面积约一亿四千万亩，受灾农民一千多万。但是，去年冬天，华北的生产救灾工作很有成绩。在毛主席和中央人民政府的深切关怀和正确指示之下，各地决心大，动手早，抓的紧，集中了很大的力量作生产救灾工作，而且想了很多生产办法，因此，各地在短时期就扭转了灾害所造成的严重局面，阻止了灾情的发展。
    中央和华北各省人民政府去冬曾投放了大批粮食和贷款举办水利、交通、造林等建设事业，用以工代赈的办法救灾。察哈尔已打井一万二千眼，修渠道四百多条，修路三千七百多里。绥远已完成了四十一处开渠工程。河北、山西、察哈尔等省又动员了十六万多灾民到城镇和工矿作工，使救灾工作和长期建设结合起来。各灾区的副业生产和手工业生产都比往年门路宽，销路畅。河北、平原数十万妇女参加了纺织生产，每人每日平均可赚二三斤米。往年冬季无活作的察哈尔、绥远等省农民，去冬提出“有啥作啥，积少成多”的口号，冬季生产就迅速开展起来。察哈尔省去冬副业生产收入合米九千二百万斤，生产好的地区不但解决了农民的口粮困难，还买回了大批牲畜、农具。此外，各地还开展了信贷、自由借贷和储备种籽等工作。但各地在生产救灾工作中仍存在着很多缺点。首先是生产救灾工作发展的不平衡，有些地区注意了重灾区，放松了轻灾区；生产条件优越的地区作的较好，生产条件不好的地区就做得差些；有些地区抓紧了农业区，放松了牧畜区。不少地区在救灾工作的领导上，存在着官僚主义作风，对灾情掌握很不准确，夸大或过低估计灾情；发动灾民进行副业生产时，只有号召，没有具体领导；在发放寒衣、赈粮和贷款中，有拖延、滥用、挪用甚至贪污、浪费的现象。基于以上情况，华北区党政领导机关决定了加强领导，深入检查，坚决纠正已存问题等，以保证在最短期间完成防旱救灾和春耕准备工作。
