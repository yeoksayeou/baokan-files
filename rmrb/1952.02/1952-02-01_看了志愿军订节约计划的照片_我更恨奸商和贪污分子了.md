    After Seeing the Photo of the Volunteer Army Setting Up a Thrift Plan, I Hate Profiteers and Grafters Even More
    To the Editor: I saw the photo "Our Great Motherland" published in the People's Daily on January 24th. This photo told us that soldiers of a certain unit of the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army are formulating a thrift plan on the front line. After seeing the photo, I was so moved that I almost shed tears. This further strengthened my hatred for profiteers and strengthened my courage to struggle.
    The great Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting the enemy in the forefront of defending the motherland and Asian peace, in the midst of gunfire, their lips and hands chapped by the cold wind, but they are still fighting tenaciously to protect the security and wealth of the motherland, and constantly winning victories. In contrast, those shameless profiteers are stealing the wealth of the country, cutting corners, altering documents, falsifying accounts, smuggling and evading taxes, and pursuing exorbitant profits. What a stark contrast!
    After seeing this photo, my love and hate became even more distinct: I admire the "most beloved people" who defend the motherland; I hate those profiteers who steal the wealth of the motherland, those greedy, degenerate, and selfish grafters. I feel that this photo is of great educational significance to me. After seeing it, I am prepared to examine my own work and that of my department more deeply and comprehensively.

    看了志愿军订节约计划的照片  
    我更恨奸商和贪污分子了
    编辑同志：我看到了一月二十四日人民日报上所刊登的“我们伟大的祖国”的照片，这张照片告诉了我们，伟大的中国人民志愿军某部战士正在前线订立节约计划。我看了照片以后，激动得几乎流下泪来。这更使我加强了对奸商的仇恨，加强了我的斗争勇气。
    伟大的中国人民志愿军在保卫祖国和亚洲和平的最前线，在枪林弹雨中对敌人作战，嘴唇和手被冷风吹得破裂，但是他们仍然坚强地为保卫祖国的安全和财富而战斗，而且不断地赢得胜利。相反地，那些无耻的奸商却在偷盗国家的财富、偷工减料、涂改单据、假造账目、走私漏税、追逐暴利，这是多么鲜明的对照啊！
    看了这幅照片以后，使我的爱和憎格外分明：我敬爱的是保卫祖国的“最可爱的人”；我恨的是那些偷盗祖国财富的奸商，那些贪婪、堕落、自私的贪污分子。我觉得这幅照片对我的教育意义是很大的。看了以后，我准备更深刻地和全面地检查自己和本部门的工作。
