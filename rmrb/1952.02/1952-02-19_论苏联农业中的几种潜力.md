    On Several Potentials in Soviet Agriculture

    The Soviet "Izvestia" published an article on January 17 by Lobanov, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union, entitled "On How to Unleash the Potentials Existing in Soviet Agricultural Production." The abstract is as follows:

    Agricultural technology in the Soviet Union is progressing rapidly. Collective farms and Soviet farms are using more than 150 types of the latest and most productive machines in production. Comprehensively improving the productivity of machine tractor stations has become the main potential for further increasing agricultural production. At the same time, the best use of technology will greatly shorten working hours and improve the quality of field work.

    Each machine tractor station in our country has great production potential. If all tractor drivers had completed their work quotas and implemented two-shift operations in 1951, the main field work time for collective farms could have been almost halved. Therefore, in the 1952 production increase plan, the task of enabling each tractor driver to complete new work quotas every day is entirely possible. The experience of some advanced tractor teams in our country has fully demonstrated this point.

    In terms of technology utilization in 1952, the most important task is to strengthen the mechanization of agricultural work, while also mechanizing work departments that are mainly based on manual labor.

    Our scientific and experimental institutions have systematically cultivated some new and best varieties of agricultural crops. According to experts, if these excellent varieties were planted on all cultivated land in the country, our country would receive hundreds of millions more poods of grain and millions of poods of vegetable oil.

    Our chemical industry is expanding the production of mineral fertilizers year by year. As early as 1950, the amount of phosphate, potash, and nitrogen fertilizers obtained by agriculture was almost double that of 1940. However, the needs of agriculture are increasing without limit. Therefore, a fuller and more correct use of various local fertilizers is of particular importance. However, the work of various collective farms in utilizing local fertilizers is unsatisfactory.

    Soviet scientific research and experimental institutions have studied the rational use of fertilizers in detail, and introduced excellent fertilization methods for making fertilizers granular and using mixed fertilizers. Changing to the new granular superphosphate can increase the effectiveness of each unit of phosphorus by four to five times compared to using ordinary powdered superphosphate.

    In recent years, under the production conditions of millions of hectares of land in collective farms, it has been proven that deep plowing on black soil and deepening tillage on other types of soil (alkali land, etc.) are of great benefit. Implementing deep plowing can increase the yield of grain crops by three to five centners per hectare, and the yield of sugar beets by thirty to fifty centners per hectare. This cultivation method will also be a way to increase the yield of agricultural crops in the coming years.

    In 1952, it is planned to implement deep plowing on 18 million hectares of land. Given the current level of electrical equipment in agriculture, this plan is entirely feasible.

### 论苏联农业中的几种潜力

    论苏联农业中的几种潜力
    苏联“消息报”一月十七日发表了苏联农业部副部长劳巴诺夫“论如何发挥存在于苏联农业生产中的潜力”一文，摘要如下：
    苏联的农业技术正在日新月异地进步着。各集体农场和苏维埃农场在生产方面所使用的最新式的具有高度生产率的机器，已达一百五十种以上。全面地提高机器拖拉机的生产率，已成为使农业生产获得进一步提高的主要潜力。同时，最好的利用技术也将大大地缩短工作时间，并提高田地工作的质量。
    在我国的每个机器拖拉机站都具有很大的生产潜力。一九五一年如果全体拖拉机手都完成了工作定额并实行两班制，那么，集体农场的主要田地工作时间，差不多可以缩短到一半。因此，一九五二年的增产计划中，使每个拖拉机手每天完成新的工作定额的任务是完全可能的。我国的一些先进拖拉机工作队的经验已充分说明了这一点。
    一九五二年在利用技术方面，最重要的任务是加强农业工作的机械化，同时使以手的劳动为主的工作部门机械化。
    我们的科学和实验机关，有计划地培育出了一些新的和最好的农业作物的品种。据专家们估计，如果全国的耕地都种植这些优良品种，那么我国就会多收到数亿普特的谷物和数百万普特的植物油。
    我们的化学工业在逐年扩大着矿物肥料的生产。早在一九五○年，农业所得到的磷酸盐、钾素和氮素肥料便几乎超过了一九四○年的一倍。但农业的需要却在无限制地增加着。因此，更充分和更正确地使用当地各种肥料，具有特别重要的意义。但是，各个集体农场利用当地肥料的工作，却是不能令人满意的。
    苏联科学研究和实验机关详细地研究了合理使用肥料的问题，介绍了使肥料成为颗粒状和使用混合肥料的优良施肥方法。改用新的颗粒状的过磷酸盐，比起使用普通的粉状过磷酸盐来，每一单位的磷酸效用可提高达四倍到五倍之多。
    近几年来，在各集体农场的数百万公顷土地的生产条件下，曾证明在黑色土壤上实行深耕和在他种土壤（碱地等）上加深耕作，都有很大的好处。实行深耕可以使种植谷类农作物的土地每公顷多收三到五公担，种植甜菜的土地，每公顷多收三十到五十公担。这种耕种方法，在今后的若干年中也是提高农业作物收获量的方法。
    一九五二年，拟在一千八百万公顷的土地上实行深耕。就目前农业中已有的电力设备的水平而论，这一计划是完全可能实现的。
