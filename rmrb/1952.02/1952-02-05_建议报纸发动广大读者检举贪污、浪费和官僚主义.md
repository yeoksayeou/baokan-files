    Reader's Letter:

    Suggest Newspapers Mobilize Readers to Report Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    Comrade Editor: I suggest that newspapers mobilize the broad masses of readers to bravely report all acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. I believe that newspapers should specifically request readers to actively write to the newspaper office to report all acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, reflect the opinions and feelings of the surrounding masses on increasing production and practicing economy and the anti-corruption movement, and introduce the cases exposed by institutions and organizations and the roots of such phenomena. And I hope that the newspaper office will be responsible for handling this type of material, explain it clearly, and resolutely support the informers. Tang Xingkui

    Editor's Note: Comrade Tang Xingkui's suggestion is very good. This newspaper welcomes the broad masses of readers to enthusiastically write letters to report all phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and will be responsible for publishing them in the newspaper or transferring them to relevant agencies for handling. We have done this in the past and are continuing to strengthen this work. This newspaper has responsibly handled all such letters received in the past.

    建议报纸发动广大读者检举贪污、浪费和官僚主义
    编辑同志：我建议报纸发动广大读者，对一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义行为勇敢地进行检举。我认为报纸应具体地要求读者积极地写信给报社，检举一切贪污浪费和官僚主义的行为，反映周围群众对增产节约及反贪污运动的意见和感想，介绍机关团体所揭发出来的事例及发生此类现象的根源等。并希报社对这一类的材料负责处理，交代清楚，坚决地支持检举者。　唐星魁
    编者按：唐星魁同志的意见很好。本报欢迎广大读者踊跃地写信检举一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，并负责在报上发表或转有关机关处理。过去我们已经这样做了，并正继续加强这个工作。本报过去收到的此种来信，都已负责地予以处理。
