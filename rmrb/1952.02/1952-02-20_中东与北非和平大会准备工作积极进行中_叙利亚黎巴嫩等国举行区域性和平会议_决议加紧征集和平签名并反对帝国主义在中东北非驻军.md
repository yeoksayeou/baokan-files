Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 15th: From Pakistan to Morocco, the broad masses of people are preparing for the Middle East and North Africa Peace Conference. These preparations are supported by broad mass organizations, especially democratic trade unions and democratic women's and youth organizations. In Iran, a preparatory committee of seventeen people, representing all strata of the people, has been organized. Those participating in the Peace Conference were approved at the tens of thousands of people's peace conference held in Tehran on November 23 and the Tehran mass rally on February 8. After Syria and Lebanon elected representatives to attend the Middle East and North Africa Peace Conference, they held regional peace conferences. Such conferences have been held in Damascus, Tripoli, Beirut, and other places. In these countries, the preparations for the Peace Conference are linked to strengthening local peace activities, such as organizing new local peace committees, intensifying the signature campaign to demand the signing of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and passing resolutions opposing the stationing of imperialist troops in the Middle East and North Africa, and opposing these countries joining the planned "Middle East Command." The preparatory committees for the Peace Conference in various countries include political figures, lawyers, workers, artists, Christian pastors, Muslim leaders, industrialists and businessmen, and party leaders. It is reported that the Damascus Declaration, advocating the convening of the Middle East Peace Conference, has also received the support of representatives from all walks of life, Jews and Arabs, in Israel.
