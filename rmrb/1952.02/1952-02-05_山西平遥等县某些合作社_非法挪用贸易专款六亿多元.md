    Certain Cooperatives in Pingyao and Other Counties in Shanxi Province 
    Illegally Misappropriate Over 600 Million Yuan of Trade Funds
    The working group organized by the Finance and Economics Committee of the Yuci Prefecture Administrative Office in Shanxi Province conducted nearly half a month of work in Pingyao, Fenyang, Wenshui, and Taigu counties last December to clear up cotton property and other matters. During the work, they discovered that certain cooperatives in these counties had committed illegal acts of misappropriating trade funds amounting to over 650 million yuan. They misappropriated state funds to pay fertilizer loans to county cooperatives, repay bank loans, deposit funds in banks to earn interest, pay cotton ginning wages, and purchase grain, general merchandise, and set up oil workshops. Some funds were used for meal allowances and borrowed by cadres, etc. In particular, the Dujiazhuang Village Cooperative in Pingyao County misappropriated a portion of the grain paid in advance for cotton (equivalent to 22.2 million yuan) as internal business expenses for as long as five months. Cooperatives are an important part of the people's economy, and they should become powerful assistants to the state-owned economy, actively helping state trade complete purchasing and sales tasks and meet the needs of the state and the people. However, the responsible cadres of cooperatives in these counties with the above-mentioned phenomena only see the immediate interests of their departments and a few individuals, and arbitrarily misappropriate state special funds, causing the accumulation and waste of state funds. At the same time, the state-owned trade departments that control the funds are also negligent in inspection, and this bureaucratic work style is the main cause of the misappropriation of special funds and waste. The relevant cooperative and state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company leaders should conduct a deep self-criticism.

    山西平遥等县某些合作社  
    非法挪用贸易专款六亿多元
    山西榆次专署财政经济委员会组织的工作组，去年十二月在平遥、汾阳、文水、太谷等县进行了近半个月的清理棉花财产等工作。工作中，发现这几个县的某些合作社挪用贸易专款达六亿五千多万元的犯法行为。他们挪用国家资金，有的缴县社肥料贷款，有的还银行贷款，有的存入银行生息，有的支付轧花工资，还有的用来购买粮食、百货、开办油房，有的是伙食借用、干部借用等等。特别是平遥县杜家庄村社把预购棉付实粮挪用了一部（折款二千二百多万元），作为社内业务费用达五个月之久。合作社是人民经济的重要组成部分，它应成为国营经济的有力助手，积极地帮助国家贸易完成购销任务，满足国家和人民的要求。但这些县有上述现象的合作社的负责干部，光看见本部门和少数人的眼前利益，随便挪用国家专款，造成国家资金的积压和浪费。同时，掌握资金的国营贸易部门，也疏于检查，这种官僚主义作风是造成挪用专款和浪费现象的主要原因。有关合作社和有关国营花纱布公司领导方面应作深刻检讨。
