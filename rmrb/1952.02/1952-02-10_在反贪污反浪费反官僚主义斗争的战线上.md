On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy

    Shanghai Industrial Workers Participate in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    Over 100,000 industrial workers from more than 140 state-owned and public factories in Shanghai have joined the anti-corruption struggle.

    Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, convened a symposium of senior technical personnel from various enterprises, calling on all technical personnel and workers to bravely expose the serious wrongdoings of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and criticizing the old bourgeois technical viewpoints. Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Enterprise Management Committee of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, also made a mobilization report at a meeting of responsible cadres from state-owned and public factories. He pointed out: This is an extremely important link in transforming old industrial and mining enterprises. Everyone should thoroughly expose the phenomena and behaviors of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and establish various new management systems in enterprises.

    Subsequently, this movement was launched in factories such as the State-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Mill. Before the movement began, factories prepared materials, and the responsible cadres of the factory's Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League took the lead in self-criticism. Then, a conference of employee representatives was convened to conduct demonstration self-criticisms and deliver mobilization reports, and each factory established a production increase and economy committee and inspection teams. Through the reports delivered at the employee representative meetings, extensive and enthusiastic discussions were launched among all workers. At the same time, various units continuously invited relevant shop assistants, merchants, and family members of staff to hold seminars, mobilizing them to report corrupt elements.

    Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Organizes Special Institutions to Lead the Anti-Corruption Struggle in Factories and Enterprises

    Since the democratic reform movement was launched in factories and enterprises in Wuhan in May of last year, 103 units with more than 53,300 employees have participated in the movement. However, according to the facts revealed after the initial launch of the anti-corruption struggle in some units, the problems of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy were not thoroughly exposed and resolved in the past democratic reform movement, which mainly focused on combating feudal remnants and eliminating their influence. Particularly in the departments of factories that manage finances, material storage and procurement, and finished product sales, which control massive amounts of property and are in frequent contact with the outside world, corruption and waste are very serious. As for the phenomenon of cadres and workers in various factories wasting state property due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology, it is even more widespread. Based on the above situation, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened two factory and enterprise meetings to conduct in-depth research on the relationship between the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and the democratic reform, and organized special institutions to lead the movement in factories and enterprises.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    上海产业工人参加反贪污斗争
    上海市一百四十多个国营、公营工厂的十多万产业工人投入反贪污斗争。
    华东军政委员会主席饶漱石曾召集各企业的高级技术人员举行座谈会，号召所有技术人员和工人勇敢揭发贪污、浪费和官僚主义的严重错误行为，并批评了旧的资产阶级的技术观点。中共中央华东局企业管理委员会书记谭震林也在国营、公营工厂负责干部会议上作了动员报告。他指出：这是改造旧工矿企业的一个极重要的环节，大家应该彻底揭发贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象和行为，并在企业中建立各种新的管理制度。
    接着，这一运动就在国营上海第九棉纺织厂等工厂中展开。各工厂在运动开展前，一方面准备好材料，另一方面由各厂党组织、行政、工会和青年团的负责干部带头检查；随着就召开职工代表会议，进行示范检讨和作启发动员报告，并组成了各厂的增产节约委员会和检查小组。通过职工代表会议的传达报告，在全体工人中展开了广泛热烈的讨论。与此同时，各单位又连续邀请有关店员、商人和工作人员家属举行座谈会，动员他们检举贪污分子。
    中共武汉市委组织专门机构领导工厂企业的反贪污斗争
    武汉市各工厂企业自去年五月开展民主改革运动以来，截至目前为止，已有一百零三个单位、五万三千三百多职工参加了这一运动。但据某些单位初步开展反贪污斗争后的事实证明，过去在以打击封建残余势力并清除其影响为主的民主改革运动中，贪污、浪费和官僚主义问题并没有得到彻底的暴露和解决。特别是在工厂中的财务管理、材料保管采购、成品推销等掌握巨量财物而又和外界经常接触的部门，贪污、浪费更是十分严重。至于各工厂干部和工人群众因受资产阶级思想的侵蚀而浪费国家财产的现象更为普遍。中共武汉市委员会根据上述情况，曾召开了两次工厂企业会议，对于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和民主改革的关系作了深入的研究，并组织了专门机构领导工厂企业的运动。
