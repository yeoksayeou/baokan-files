Xinhua News Agency, 24th: While the US side's representatives at the Korean armistice talks continue to insist on their absurd demand for so-called "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war, American aggressors are constantly subjecting our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps to various forms of abuse and arbitrary killings, attempting to achieve their despicable goal of detaining a large number of our captured personnel. On the 18th, the American aggressors once again created a heinous and bloody incident of large-scale slaughter of our captured personnel.

According to the Associated Press, at 6:00 AM on the 18th, a large number of American aggressor troops surrounded the 62nd prisoner-of-war camp they had set up on Geoje Island and launched a frenzied massacre against our unarmed captured personnel. The Associated Press said that 75 of our captured personnel were killed and 139 were wounded.

This bloody massacre by the American aggressors was a barbaric measure taken after their attempt to force our captured personnel to accept their "voluntary repatriation" principle failed. As everyone knows, the American aggressors have adopted all kinds of extremely shameless and barbaric means in an attempt to coerce our captured personnel to accept their absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation." The American aggressors have subjected our captured personnel to all kinds of abuse, torture, and arbitrary killings in prisoner-of-war camps, forced them to tattoo reactionary slogans on their bodies, and forced them to undergo fascist education, etc. But despite this, they still failed to achieve their goal. Anxious to force our captured personnel to accept their unreasonable principle of "voluntary repatriation," the American aggressors, on the 18th of this month, dispatched troops to surround the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island and conducted individual "interrogations" of our captured personnel in the prisoner-of-war camp, forcing them to "express their opinions in secret rooms" (Associated Press). Despite the vicious and intimidating tactics used by the American aggressors, they were still unable to subdue our captured personnel. As a result, the American aggressors carried out this inhuman massacre of our captured personnel.

This bloody incident created by the American aggressors fully exposes the inhuman and beastly face of the United States and also proves what a shameless and cruel deception the US's so-called "voluntary repatriation" is.

    美国侵略者疯狂屠杀我被俘人员
    充分暴露美方所谓“自愿遣返”是无耻和残忍的骗局
    【新华社二十四日讯】和美方代表在朝鲜停战谈判会议上继续坚持其战俘所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬要求同时，美国侵略者在俘虏营中对我方被俘人员不断施行各种虐待和任意残杀，妄图达到其扣留我方大批被俘人员的卑鄙目的。美国侵略者在十八日竟又一次地制造了大规模屠杀我方被俘人员的令人发指的血腥事件。
    据美联社透露：在十八日早晨六时，大批美国侵略军包围了它们设在巨济岛上的第六十二号俘虏营，向我方赤手空拳的被俘人员进行疯狂的屠杀。据美联社说，我方被俘人员被打死七十五人，打伤一百三十九人。
    美国侵略者这次血腥大屠杀，是在它们妄图强迫我方被俘人员接受其“自愿遣返”原则遭受失败后所采取的野蛮手段。大家知道，美国侵略者曾采取了各种极端无耻和野蛮的手段，妄图胁迫我方被俘人员接受其“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则。美国侵略者在俘虏营中百般虐待、拷打和任意残害我方被俘人员，强迫在我方被俘人员身上刺反动口号，强迫对我方被俘人员进行法西斯教育等等。但是尽管如此，仍未能达到目的。美国侵略者急于迫使我方被俘人员接受其“自愿遣返”的无理原则，便于本月十八日一面派遣军队将巨济岛上的俘虏营团团包围，一面即在俘虏营中对我方被俘人员进行了个别“讯问”，强迫他们“在密室中表示自己的意见”（美联社）。尽管美国侵略者施用了如此凶恶和威吓的手段，但是仍无法使我方被俘人员屈服。于是美国侵略者竟向我被俘人员实行了这次灭绝人性的大屠杀。
    美国侵略者制造的这次血腥事件，充分暴露了美国惨无人道的野兽面目，同时也证明了美方所谓“自愿遣返”是一个多么无耻和残忍的骗局。
