    Serious Tax Evasion and Illegal Business Practices in Shijiazhuang's Private Automobile Transportation Industry

    To the Editor: There are serious tax evasion and illegal business practices in Shijiazhuang's private automobile transportation industry. Under the protection of private firms, private automobiles engaged in transportation business in Shijiazhuang have not paid taxes since liberation, resulting in significant losses to national tax revenue. Automobile transportation businesses should be taxed. According to my understanding, the average monthly business revenue of each vehicle is 10 million yuan. If taxed at 5% for commercial tax, each vehicle should pay 6 million yuan in taxes annually. Shijiazhuang's private automobile transportation industry currently has cars which, if calculated at ten vehicles, should pay the state 60 to 70 million yuan annually. In fact, before 1951, the number of private automobiles in Shijiazhuang was even greater than it is now.

    Because these private automobile transportation businesses do not pay national taxes, their operating costs are relatively lower. Therefore, they use various means to compete with state-owned automobile companies. For example, each time transport prices are adjusted, they do not adhere to the agreed-upon unified prices, but arbitrarily raise or lower them. To control passengers and goods, they also organize "grabbing" (lōu bāo), randomly pulling and dragging on street corners and main roads, even defrauding passengers, causing chaos in the city and in automobile transportation order, arousing extreme dissatisfaction among passengers. To organize a stronger force to confront state-owned automobile companies, they even use despicable means such as enticement and bribery to pull in many vehicles involved in production within government organizations (such as state-owned farms and military district headquarters). As a result, many cadres and workers have been dragged into this. To control passengers and goods and seek exorbitant profits, private firms in the city have even established ticket offices in bicycle shops, barbershops, grocery stores, etc., greatly expanding the "grabbing" organization.

    I believe that this situation cannot be allowed to continue. I suggest that the Shijiazhuang City Thrift and Inspection Committee conduct a thorough inspection of the private automobile transportation industry during the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, ban the illegal "grabbing" organizations, and have them pay back the national taxes they have evaded.

### 石家庄市私营汽车运输业  有严重漏税和非法经营行为

    石家庄市私营汽车运输业
    有严重漏税和非法经营行为
    编辑同志：石家庄市私营汽车运输业中，有严重的漏税和非法经营的行为。石家庄市经营运输业务的私营汽车，在私营行栈的包庇下，从解放以来就没有纳过税，国家税收受到很大的损失。汽车经营运输是应该纳税的。据我所知，他们的业务情况，每部车每月的平均营业收入有一千万元，如按行商税百分之五计征，每部车每年就应纳税六百万元。石家庄市私营汽车运输业现有汽车，如按十部计算，一年就应当向国家纳税六、七千万元。事实上，在一九五一年以前，石家庄市私营汽车的数目比现在还多。
    这些私营汽车运输业不纳国税，经营成本相对减低，于是他们就施用各种手段和国营汽车公司竞争。例如，每次调整运价时，他们都不照协议的统一运价执行，而是任意抬高或降低。为了把持客货，他们还组织了“搂包”，在街口要道乱拉乱扯，甚至欺诈旅客，造成市容和汽车运输秩序的混乱，引起旅客的极端不满。他们为了组织更多的力量和国营汽车公司对抗，更用拉拢、行贿等卑鄙手段，拉上了很多搞机关生产的汽车（如国营农场、分区司令部等单位的汽车）。因此，不少干部和工人被拖下水。该市的私营行栈为了把持客货，牟取暴利，竟在市内自行车行、理发店、杂货铺等处设立售票处，大大发展了“搂包”组织。
    我认为这种情况是不容许继续存在的。我建议石家庄市节约检查委员会在反行贿、反偷漏税运动中，对私营汽车运输业做一次彻底检查，取缔非法的“搂包”组织，并让他们补缴偷漏的国税。
