    The People's Government of Nangong County, Hebei Province
    Should Examine the "Habit" of Forced Treating
    To the Editor: The People's Government of Nangong County, Hebei Province, has a bad practice of forcing people to "treat." This practice hinders work and wastes state property.
    In October 1951, Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce, following instructions from higher authorities, held a "General Merchandise Exhibition Conference" in the Jinnan District. This exhibition was first held in Xinji Town, and in November it was planned to be moved to Nangong County to continue the exhibition. Before the transfer, the Exhibition Conference Committee sent people to contact the People's Government of Nangong County, but to no avail. The second time they sent people, explaining that this exhibition was to promote mutual assistance and material exchange between urban and rural areas. The comrade in charge of reception at the People's Government of Nangong County said, "We have a 'habit' here; you have to treat us before we can do anything." For the sake of work, the Exhibition Conference Committee had no choice but to accept the "suggestion" of treating. As a result, they spent more than one million yuan to treat 29 people, including County Chief Liu of Nangong County, Director Zhang of the County Finance and Economic Committee, the Secretary of the Nangong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Director Zhang of the County Public Security Bureau, Minister Wang of the County Armed Forces Department, Director Gao of the County Tax Bureau, the Director of the County Grain Depot, Director Zhang of the County Cultural Center, Principal Wang of Nangong Middle School, and Principal Liu of Nangong Normal School, to a meal before the exhibition could be held.
    I believe that this "habit" of forced treating in Nangong County is very bad. I suggest that the relevant leaders of Nangong County examine this matter in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and correct this bad "habit." At the same time, I think that the responsible comrades of the Hebei Provincial Urban and Rural Material Exchange General Merchandise Exhibition Conference did not adhere to principles in this treating incident, thus causing a waste of state property, and they should also conduct a self-criticism.

### 河北省南宫县人民政府  应检查强迫请客的“习惯”

    河北省南宫县人民政府  
    应检查强迫请客的“习惯”
    编辑同志：河北省南宫县人民政府有一种强迫“请客”的坏作风。这种作风，妨碍了工作，浪费了国家财产。
    一九五一年十月，河北省百货公司接受上级指示，在冀南区举办“百货展览大会”。这个展览会先在辛集镇举行，十一月间准备转移到南宫县继续展出。转移前，展览大会委员会派人到南宫县人民政府联系，没有结果。第二次又派人去，说明这个展览会是为了促进城乡互助和物资交流。南宫县人民政府负责接待的同志说：“我们当地有一个‘习惯’，办事先请客。”为了工作，展览大会委员会只好接受了请客的“建议”。结果，化了一百多万元，请南宫县刘县长、县财政经济委员会张主任、中共南宫县委书记、县公安局张局长、县武装部王部长、县税局高主任、县粮库主任、县文化馆张馆长、南宫中学王校长、南宫师范学校刘校长等二十九人吃了一顿，才把展览会办起来。
    我认为南宫县这种强迫请客的“习惯”是很坏的，我建议南宫县有关领导方面，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，对这件事加以检查，并纠正这种不良“习惯”。同时，我觉得河北省城乡物资交流百货展览大会的负责同志，在这一请客事件中不坚持原则，因而造成国家财产的浪费，也应该检讨。    刘泽庭
