    The Northwest Production and Drought Prevention Committee Issues Emergency Notice
    Calling for Immediate Mobilization of Peasants to Sweep and Store Snow to Prevent Drought
    All Areas Must Prevent Complacency Among Peasants After Snowfall
    On February 23rd, snowfall occurred throughout the Northwest region, and by noon on the 24th, heavy snow was still falling. The snowfall near Xi'an reached 10 millimeters. The Northwest Production and Drought Prevention Committee has issued an emergency notice to the People's Governments, Production and Drought Prevention Offices, and agricultural and forestry agencies of all provinces, urging them to immediately mobilize the peasant masses to sweep and store snow to prevent drought. The Northwest Production and Drought Prevention Committee emphasized in the notice: All areas must pay attention to correcting the complacency of peasants after snowfall and earnestly carry out the following tasks:
    1. This heavy snowfall is extremely beneficial to spring sowing and winter wheat growth. All areas should immediately seize the opportunity to universally launch a snow sweeping and snow storage campaign to achieve the purpose of water storage, moisture retention, and drought prevention. County, district, and township cadres should brave the snow to go to the countryside to mobilize peasants, and while the accumulated snow has not melted, collect as much accumulated snow and ice as possible from field edges, roads, ditches, streets, threshing grounds, and courtyards and transport it to the fields or store it in waterlogged ponds and cellars.
    2. District and township cadres, Communist Party members, Youth League members, and model laborers should take the lead actively, with the village as the unit and the mutual aid team as the core, to motivate all male and female peasants to work together, challenge each other in competitions, and launch snow sweeping and snow storage competitions between villages, teams, and households. After the snowfall, each township can compare snow piles, select models, and give rewards.
    3. In order to harvest grain early and harvest more grain, dry land and wheat fields that are prepared to plant early-maturing crops should store a large amount of snow. The more snow stored in wheat fields, the more it can prevent wheat seedlings from growing too vigorously too early, avoid frost damage, and kill underground pests. Orchards should also pay attention to stacking snow to prevent drought and protect production.
    4. During this snow sweeping and snow storage campaign, all areas should conduct in-depth ideological education for peasants on "Man can conquer nature," and correct the complacent and lax thinking of peasants after snowfall.
    The notice also pointed out that the snow sweeping and snow storage campaign is the first battle in the Northwest region's drought prevention and resistance campaign this year, and this battle must be fought well and won!

    西北生产防旱委员会发出紧急通知
    号召立即发动农民群众扫雪积雪防旱
    各地必须防止下雪后农民产生的麻痹思想
    二月二十三日西北各地落雪，到二十四日中午大雪仍在纷飞，西安附近降雪量已达十公厘。西北区生产防旱委员会为此特紧急通知各省人民政府、生产防旱办公室和农林机关，立即发动农民群众扫雪、积雪防旱。西北区生产防旱委员会在通知中强调指出：各地必须注意纠正雪后农民所产生的麻痹思想，切实做好以下几项工作：
    一、这次大雪，对于春季播种和冬麦生长极为有利，各地应立即抓紧时机，普遍开展扫雪、积雪运动，达到蓄水、保墒、防旱的目的。县、区、乡干部应冒雪到农村中去发动农民，趁积雪未消以前，把地畔、路上、沟里、街道、场上及院中的积雪、存冰，尽量收集起来，运到田里或积入涝池和水窖。二、区乡干部、共产党员、青年团员和劳动模范，都应积极带头，以村为单位，以互助组为核心，带动全体男女农民一起动手，互相挑战竞赛，展开村与村、组与组、家家户户的扫雪、积雪竞赛。雪后各乡可比雪堆，评选模范，给予奖励。三、为了早打粮和多打粮，准备种早熟庄稼的旱田和麦田都应该大量积雪。麦田积雪愈多，愈能防止麦苗过早发旺，免受冻害，并可杀死地下害虫。其余像果园，亦应注意垒雪防旱保产。四、在这次扫雪、积雪运动中，各地应对农民深入地进行“人定胜天”的思想教育，纠正雪后农民所产生的麻痹松懈的思想。
    通知上还指出扫雪、积雪运动是西北区今年防旱、抗旱运动的第一仗，这一仗必须打好，打胜！
