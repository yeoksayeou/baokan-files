Comrades from all walks of life in Beijing:

    First of all, I thank you for your enthusiastic help and support for the government's work!

    On January 19th, we dispatched 253 representative groups to various streets, alleys, and villages to listen to your opinions and accept your reports on all instances of government workers engaging in corruption, bribery, extortion, and other illegal and undisciplined behaviors, as well as bad work styles. In just four days, we received 10,986 pieces of reports and opinions from you. This fully demonstrates your help to us, your love for the country, and your sense of responsibility.

    Among the reports and opinions submitted, 1,190 were related to the Beijing Public Security Bureau, 534 to other bureaus of the Municipal Government, 632 to district people's governments, 4,147 to village cadres, 690 to cooperatives, 42 to state-owned enterprises, 308 to mass organizations, 1,208 to industrial and commercial households, 1,625 to residents, 312 to central government agencies, 73 to other locations, and 225 others. The content of the reports and opinions included 9,813 cases related to anti-corruption, anti-waste, anti-bureaucracy, and other work style issues, and 1,173 other cases related to criminal matters, mass disputes, and individual problems.

    In order to handle these matters in a unified way and ensure that every case is accounted for and resolved, we have established a special handling committee at the municipal level, led by Deputy Mayor Wu Han and Deputy Director Feng Jiping, and handling groups at the district level, to conduct investigations and research. They will be handled according to the following principles: materials reporting illegal industrial and commercial households engaging in bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property will all be transferred to the Municipal Savings Inspection Committee for unified handling. Materials reporting government workers' corruption, bribery, extortion, etc., will be verified, and if true, will be seriously dealt with according to the severity of the circumstances. Those who should be detained and prosecuted will be strictly prosecuted. The property obtained and debts owed will be returned or compensated as appropriate. Regarding problems related to work style, such as the old police style of police officers in police stations, they will be ordered to resolutely correct themselves, admit their mistakes, and make public or face-to-face apologies. If some staff members of cooperatives and retail stores are harming others for their own benefit, have chaotic accounts, or have improper work styles, the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters will be responsible for relying on the supervision of members to immediately establish systems, correct their work styles, and have the offending staff members make public self-criticisms at mass meetings. Regarding issues related to the welfare of the masses, such as some organizations not cleaning the streets and having the masses clean for them, or some residents piling up filth outside the walls, harming public health, they will be ordered to immediately correct their mistakes. Regarding disputes among residents, the handling group and the police station will jointly help negotiate a solution and establish a covenant to be jointly observed. In addition, special meetings will be convened to study and resolve problems such as preferential treatment and relief, problems existing in the land reform in suburban areas, and certain problems of street activists. As for some personal difficulties raised by some citizens, the district governments and relevant departments have been instructed to help resolve them properly.

    Now, most of these materials have been sorted out. The handling group is responding to the issues raised by individual informants. Regarding issues related to the lives of the broad masses, the handling group is gradually convening mass meetings in the police station districts to give comprehensive answers. Within days, after the handling groups have completed the handover of the handling situation, the districts will convene mass meetings, and responsible comrades from the Municipal Government and various parties will go to each district to give a comprehensive account and solicit your opinions. Finally, the handling committee will inspect the handling situation.

    This visit, with your enthusiastic help and support, has yielded great results. As a result of doing so, your supervision of government workers has been strengthened, the connection between the government and you has been closer, and the people's democratic rights have been further promoted. Under your supervision and support, not only have errors and shortcomings in our work been corrected and our work improved, but the strength of the government has also been greatly strengthened. Many citizens have suggested that representative groups should be dispatched regularly in the future to directly visit and listen to everyone's opinions. This suggestion is very good, and we fully agree. We will do this in the future.

    In addition, if you have any opinions, whether it is a report against government workers or a criticism of government work, you can write to us directly or send it to P.O. Box 100 at any time and in any place.

    Comrades from all walks of life! Let us all unite as one, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to eliminate all the filth and poison left over from the old society, eliminate all obstacles, and develop the various construction undertakings of the capital and build our capital!

    I would like to thank you and pay my respects to you here!

                                                Peng Zhen, February 17, 1952

    北京市彭真市长致函各界人民
    感谢市民检举政府工作人员中的非法行为所有问题将统一进行处理作到件件有交代各界市民同志们：
    首先我感谢你们对于政府工作的热烈帮助和支持！
    一月十九日，我们曾派遣了二百五十三个代表组，到各街巷，各村庄，倾听你们的意见，接受你们对政府工作人员中所有的贪污受贿、敲诈勒索和其他违法乱纪行为及坏作风的检举。在短短四天中，就收到你们的检举材料和意见一万零九百八十六件，这充分表明了你们对于我们的帮助，对于国家的爱护和负责。
    在检举和所提的意见中，有关市公安局的一千一百九十件，市府其他各局的五百三十四件，区人民政府的六百三十二件，村干部的四千一百四十七件，合作社的六百九十件，国营企业的四十二件，群众团体的三百零八件，工商业户的一千二百零八件，居民的一千六百二十五件，中央机关的三百一十二件，外地的七十三件，其他二百二十五件。检举和所提问题的内容，属于反贪污反浪费反官僚主义和其他作风问题的九千八百十三件，其他属于刑事案件、群众纠纷和个别问题的共一千一百七十三件。
    为了统一处理，做到件件有交代，有结果，我们在市一级以吴晗副市长、冯基平副局长为骨干成立了专门的处理委员会、在区成立了处理组，进行调查研究，并按照下面原则进行处理：属于检举不法工商业户行贿、漏税、盗窃国家财富等材料，全部移送市节约检查委员会，统一并案处理。检举机关工作人员的贪污、受贿、敲诈、勒索等材料，核对属实，即时按其情节轻重严肃处理，应扣押法办者即严加法办；其所得财物和所欠账目，当归还者归还，当赔偿者赔偿。属于工作作风方面的问题，如派出所民警的旧警察作风，除责令他们坚决改正，低头认错以外，并令其当众或当面道歉；如合作社、零售店有些工作人员，损人利己、账目混乱，作风不正派等，即由市合作总社负责，依靠社员监督，立即建立制度，改正作风，并使犯错误的工作人员在群众大会上作公开检讨承认错误。属于群众生活福利方面的问题如有些机关团体，不出来扫街，让群众替他们扫，或有些住户在墙外堆积秽土，妨害公共卫生等，即令其立即改正错误。属于居民间的纠纷的，由处理组和派出所共同帮助协商解决，并订立公约，共同遵守。此外如优抚救济问题、郊区土地改革中存在的问题和街道积极分子的若干问题等。则召集专门会议，研究解决。至于有些市民所要求解决的个人困难问题，已令区政府和主管部门帮助妥善解决。
    现在，这些材料已经大部清理完毕，个别检举人所提出的问题，处理组正在向检举人作答复；和广大群众生活有关的问题，处理组正陆续在派出所管区召集群众会作综合答复；日内各处理组将处理情况交代完毕以后，各区将召集群众大会，由市府、各方面负责同志分别到各区作全面交代，并征求你们的意见；最后并将由处理委员会对处理情况进行检查。
    这一次的访问，在你们热烈帮助和支持下，取得了很大收获。因为这样做的结果，已把你们对政府工作人员的监督加强了，把政府和你们之间的联系，更加密切了，人民的民主权利更进一步发扬了。在你们监督与支持之下，不但纠正了工作中的错误和缺点，改进了工作，而且也大大加强了政府的力量。有许多市民同志提出意见，要求今后定期派遣代表组直接访问，听取大家的意见。这个意见很好，我们完全同意，今后就这样做。
    此外，你们有意见时，不管是对政府工作人员的检举，或是对政府工作的批评，无论在什么时候，什么地方，都可以直接写信给我们或寄一百号邮政信箱。
    各界市民同志们！让我们大家万众一心，在毛主席的领导下，扫除旧社会遗留下来的一切污毒，扫除一切障碍，来发展首都的各项建设事业，建设我们的首都吧！
    我在此谨向你们致谢并致敬！
                        彭真  一九五二年二月十七日
