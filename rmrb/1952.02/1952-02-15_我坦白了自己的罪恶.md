    I Confessed My Crimes
    Comrade Editor: I am a staff member of the Catering and Accommodation Management Section of Beijing Normal University. In 1951, I embezzled more than 3.48 million yuan of the people's student aid funds. The first time I heard Mayor Peng Zhen's report on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, I felt my burden was very heavy. Although I appeared calm on the outside, I was terrified inside. I dared not meet the eyes of the group leader and always avoided getting close to him. The second time Mayor Peng Zhen's recorded report was broadcast, I heard him say that there were also cases of fraudulently claiming people's student aid funds in schools. This sentence pierced my heart, making me restless; when I got off work and went home, I could hardly lift my legs.
    My wife is an activist in the neighborhood, and my child is a member of the Communist Youth League. When I returned home, the two of them were energetically discussing the issues of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, but I dared not say a word. At night, I couldn't sleep well, I couldn't eat, and I felt a knife-like pain in my heart all day long. One day, a colleague asked me to write slogans against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Every word I wrote felt like a needle pricking my heart. My wrist became weaker and weaker, and after I finished writing, I left without daring to post them. That noon, everyone else had left work, and I sat alone in the office, pondering. I thought, the people's student aid funds are saved drop by drop with the people's blood and sweat to help students study in peace and serve the motherland in the future. How could I embezzle them? The more I thought about it, the more I felt my sins were great, and the more I hated myself. I also thought that in this movement, the entire nation has been mobilized, and no corrupt element can escape this "inescapable net." My only way out is to confess. When I returned home, my wife and son encouraged me to confess and helped me dispel all kinds of concerns. Finally, I boldly confessed to the organization. After confessing, I felt the burden was gone, and my body and mind were relaxed. The school administration treated me leniently, and I was moved to tears. Chairman Mao saved me from the deep pit. I must continue to deeply examine my thoughts in the future, be a new person, and redeem myself through meritorious service!

### 我坦白了自己的罪恶

    我坦白了自己的罪恶
    编辑同志：我是北京师范大学膳宿管理科的一个工作人员。一九五一年，我贪污了人民助学金三百四十八万多元。我第一次听了彭真市长关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的报告后，觉得自己的包袱非常沉重，虽然外表上装得很安静，内心里却是惶恐不安。我不敢和小组长的眼光接触，总是避免和他接近。第二次播送彭真市长报告的录音的时候，我听到他说学校里也有冒领人民助学金的现象。这句话直刺着我的心，使我坐卧不安；下班回家时，我的两条腿几乎抬不动了。
    我的妻子是街道的积极分子，我的孩子是个青年团员。我回到家里的时候，她母子俩非常有劲地谈着关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的问题，但是我完全不敢搭嘴。晚上，我睡觉也睡不好，饭也吃不下，终日都感到像刀子剜心一样的痛苦。有一天，一位工作同志叫我写反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的标语，我写一个字，就像我的心被扎了一针。手腕越写越瘫软，写完了我就走，不敢拿去张贴。当天中午别人都下班走了，我独自一个人坐在办公室里沉思。我想着，人民助学金是人民一滴血一滴汗地节省下来，帮助同学们安心求学，将来为祖国服务的，我怎能把它贪污了呢？越想越觉得自己的罪恶重大，也就越痛恨自己。我又想，在这次运动中，全国人民都动员起来了，任何贪污分子都逃不出这个“天罗地网”，自己的出路只有一条，就是坦白。我回到家里的时候，妻子和儿子都鼓励我坦白，并且帮助我打消种种顾虑。最后我就大胆向组织坦白了。坦白以后，觉得包袱丢了，身心都轻松了，学校行政方面对我从宽处理，我感激得流出热泪。毛主席把我从深坑里拯救了出来，我以后一定要继续深入检查自己的思想，做一个新人，戴罪立功！
