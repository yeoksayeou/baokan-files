    Thoroughly Eradicate the Old Police Work Style
    The police organs of the old society were a den of sin for safeguarding the interests of the reactionary ruling class, and the old police personnel developed the bad habits of extorting, blackmailing, and bullying the people at will. However, in the new society, in the era of the people, the bad habits of the old police are absolutely intolerable. Even the remnants of the old style must be eliminated by vigorously mobilizing the masses, so that the police organs can truly become people's police organs worthy of the name, guaranteeing the people's lives and property and social order. The mass struggle against the old police work style launched in Beijing is for this purpose. Therefore, the significance of this struggle is very significant.
    How can this struggle be brought to a complete victory? According to Beijing's experience, the most important thing is to fully promote democracy, let the broad masses rise up, and criticize the police with old work styles without any scruples or reservations. Not only criticize them for what bad things they have done, but also criticize their attitude towards mass criticism today. Use the pressure of the masses to force those personnel with dishonest attitudes to implement a thorough transformation. In addition to fully allowing the masses to criticize police personnel with old work styles, the masses should also be allowed to offer their opinions on how to handle them. The organs leading this movement should seriously consider accepting the opinions of the masses and resolutely handle them according to principles. Without doing so, it will not be possible to effectively improve the masses' sense of ownership and the courage to continue to report, expose, and criticize, nor will it be possible to truly eliminate the bad work styles of the police personnel.
    All police personnel should be given in-depth education so that everyone understands that to be a people's police, they must serve the people wholeheartedly; the bad work styles of the old police must be thoroughly eliminated, and not even a trace can be retained. It is completely wrong to be satisfied with some changes that have already been made. Because the people are not satisfied with the police personnel being "better than the police personnel in the Kuomintang era," but demand that they truly become the people's guards. This is also the glorious goal of the people's police. Every police officer should work hard towards this goal.

    彻底肃清旧警察作风
    旧社会的警察机关是保卫反动统治阶级利益的罪恶的渊薮，旧的警察人员也就养成了随意敲诈勒索、欺侮人民的恶劣作风。但是，在新社会里，在人民的时代，旧警察的恶劣作风是绝对不能容许其存在的。即使是旧作风的残余，也必须大张旗鼓地发动群众来肃清它，使警察机关真正成为保障人民生命财产和社会秩序的名符其实的人民警察机关。北京市开展的反对旧警察作风的群众斗争，就是为了这样的目的。所以这一斗争的意义是很重大的。
    怎样才能使这一斗争取得彻底的胜利呢？根据北京市的经验，最主要的是充分发扬民主，让广大群众起来，毫无顾虑、毫无保留地批评具有旧作风的警察。不仅批评他们做过什么坏事，而且批评他们今天对待群众批评的态度。用群众的压力迫使那些态度不老实的人员实行彻底的转变。除了充分地允许群众批评具有旧作风的警察人员之外，还应该允许群众提出对他们处理的意见。领导这一运动的机关则应该认真地考虑接受群众的意见，坚决地根据原则进行处理。不这样，就不能有效地提高群众的主人翁感觉和继续检举、揭发、批评的勇气，也就不能真正肃清警察人员中的恶劣作风。
    对于所有的警察人员，应该进行深入的教育，使每一个人都明白：做人民的警察，必须全心全意为人民服务；旧警察的恶劣作风，必须彻底肃清，一丝一毫也不能保留。满足于已有的一些转变，是完全错误的。因为人民不满足于警察人员“比国民党时代的警察人员为好”，而是要求他们真正成为人民的警卫员。这也就是人民警察光荣的奋斗目标。每一个警察人员都应该为这一目标而努力。
