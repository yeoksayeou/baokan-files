The national bourgeoisie is one of the four classes that make up the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. In the past, some progressive national capitalists participated in the revolution; since liberation, in terms of developing production, prospering the economy, donating to resist America and aid Korea, and participating in tax-paying competitions, many industrialists and businessmen have also shown a certain degree of positive action. Chairman Mao said in "The Current Situation and Our Tasks": "Due to the backwardness of the Chinese economy, the capitalist economy represented by the broad petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie must be allowed to exist for a long period even after the victory of the revolution throughout the country; and according to the division of labor in the national economy, all parts of them that are beneficial to the national economy also need to have a development." After the establishment of the Central People's Government, many national capitalists also participated in governments at all levels and in local consultation committees and people's representative conferences. Even after the unification of financial revenues and expenditures and the stabilization of prices in March 1950, industries and businesses that had relied on inflation and abnormal prosperity in the past collapsed one after another, and the government vigorously supported them with loans, processing, ordering, and purchasing finished products to help them overcome their difficulties. The preferential treatment enjoyed by national capitalists in politics and economics like this was something they could never have dreamed of in the reactionary government era.

However, the bourgeoisie inherently possesses the nature of harming others to benefit oneself, using public office for private gain, resorting to any means, seeking only profit, and becoming corrupt and degenerate. For example, when the government adjusts industry and commerce, they often do not use government loans or orders for legitimate business operations, but instead use them for speculation and profiteering; and for raw materials processed by the government, they underreport the quantity and use inferior materials to replace good ones. The major drug trafficker Ma Hongzao and others even took advantage of the convenience of railway transportation to smuggle and traffic more than 5,450 taels of opium and 1,120 taels of raw opium materials. They also tried to adulterate the medicine, rubber legs, vegetables, and cotton clothing supplied to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and even stole strategic materials to aid the enemy. For example, in the autumn of 1950, the traitorous merchant Zeng Qitao shipped more than 270,000 kilograms of tin for export (see Ye Jianying's report at the third session of the Fourth Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress on January 31). They used the method of "pulling the old ones in" and "sending new ones in" to corrode various state organs and state-owned enterprises. According to statistical materials from the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-shoddy work and cutting corners, and anti-stealing state economic intelligence campaigns launched throughout the country against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the state and the people, in Beijing, 150,000 cases of confession and denunciation were reported, involving more than 30,000 industrial and commercial households, and 80% to 90% of the cadres of state organs and state-owned enterprises who committed corruption crimes were related to the industrial and commercial circles. In Peng Zhen's report at the 122nd Political Affairs Conference of the State Council on February 3, it has been found that 989 industrial and commercial firms in Beijing have stolen more than 10 million yuan in state property through illegal means such as bribery, shoddy work and cutting corners, and theft of economic intelligence. Among them, 192 firms that stole more than 100 million yuan have stolen more than 200 billion yuan in state property. In Liu Lantao's report at the North China Region Thrift Examination Committee on February 7, 160,000 cases of confession and denunciation were reported in Tianjin. According to the Tianjin Tax Bureau's preliminary and extremely incomplete settlement, illegal industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin have evaded more than 800 billion yuan in state taxes alone since liberation. According to the bureau's survey of private industrial and commercial tax sources in the second half of 1951, 82% of the 1,807 households surveyed, a total of 1,490 households, evaded taxes. In Rao Shushi's mobilization report at the cadre meeting of the East China first-level organs on December 17 last year, according to the statistics of the East China People's Supervisory Committee on handling corruption cases from June 1950 to November 1951, the loss of state property caused by personal corruption amounted to 124.2 billion yuan. In mid-January, at the enlarged representative conference of Shanghai industrial and commercial circles, the traitorous merchant Zhu Peinong alone confessed that he had evaded more than 11.82 billion yuan in tax when reporting his income tax in 1950. In Xi Zhongxun's report at the cadre meeting above the division chief level of the Northwest Administrative Region on January 20, industrial and commercial people in Xi'an alone had confessed and reported bribes to cadres totaling 5.4 billion yuan, and the amount of tax evasion and theft of state property was much greater than this. As of early February, nearly 6,000 cases of illegal acts by illegal industrialists and businessmen have been reported in Xi'an. In Wuhan, as of February 1, more than 9,300 cases of reporting illegal merchants have been reported. In Chongqing, in addition to the previous 7,000 cases, 1,482 cases were reported at the city's shop assistants' representative conference on February 1 alone. A serious case of private iron and steel machinery industry merchants secretly organizing the "Star Four Dinner Party" to buy off state-owned enterprise personnel, monopolize government processing orders, and steal more than 12 billion yuan of state property in an organized and planned manner was also uncovered. In Guangzhou, the tax evaded by the brewing industry alone, in terms of commodity tax alone, was more than 11 billion yuan. According to Shenyang Mayor Zhu Qiwen's report at the Shenyang industrial and commercial circles representative conference on January 26, based solely on the self-confessions in the anti-tax evasion campaign in the industrial and commercial circles from January to April 1951, there were more than 14,000 households, plus the 21,000 households found by the government, accounting for more than two-thirds of the industrial and commercial households in Shenyang. All the above materials prove that the bourgeoisie is using various despicable and vicious means to corrupt the revolutionary regime and sabotage economic construction. It is not only attacking, but also very rampant.

Some people say that the bourgeoisie has no military force and no organization, so it is a bit excessive and too stimulating to say that they are launching rampant attacks. But they do not know that the means they use to "pull the old ones in" and "send new ones in" are corroding some cadres in the revolutionary camp, making them corrupt and degenerate, and even separating them from the revolution. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Attacking the mind is the best strategy, attacking the city is the second best." This kind of attack is actually more vicious than military attack. The reason why the Tito clique in Yugoslavia betrayed the revolution is precisely the result of the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. To vigorously counter this rampant attack by the bourgeoisie is precisely to make them quickly wake up and abide by the common program under the leadership of the Chinese working class and the state-owned economy, and jointly engage in the construction of a new democratic economy. Doing so is actually saving some illegal industrialists and businessmen, and it is not stimulating at all.

Some people say that such attacks on the bourgeoisie may damage the dignity of the bourgeoisie and affect unity. They do not know that in the current situation of stable prices and deposit interest rates of only about one percent and loan interest rates of only about two or three percent, the average profit of Chinese industry and commerce is between 15% and 30%. Illegal capitalists are still not satisfied, and they use various illegal means to obtain exorbitant profits of 100% or even more. This part of the people is no longer friends but enemies. We can only display class hatred and severely punish them in accordance with national laws. How can we still care about dignity! Chairman Mao once told us based on practice: "Seek unity through struggle, and unity will survive; seek unity through concession, and unity will perish." Doing so is precisely to consolidate and strengthen unity.

Some people say, "Worms only breed in things that are already rotten." If the cadres of state organs and state-owned enterprises had no bureaucratic work style and no corruption and waste, how could the bourgeoisie take advantage of the situation? This is also a statement to cover up the crimes of the bourgeoisie and paralyze the vigilance of the general public. The People's Government is the most honest and efficient government in Chinese history. However, our new regime is built on the ruins of thousands of years of old society. Especially in the era of the puppet government, bureaucratic capital cruelly exploited the people, making corruption a nationwide habit. This bad habit cannot be eradicated in two or three years. A part of the cadres of state organs and state-owned enterprises do have weaknesses, but if it were not for the bourgeoisie using sugar-coated bullets such as sensual pleasures and material gains to attack, they might not have become so corrupt and degenerate. According to science, bacteria invade first, and then things rot. It is not that things rot first and then bacteria invade. The Soviet Union is about to enter communism, and it still emphasizes the elimination of the remnants of bourgeois ideology. China's private capitalist economy still accounts for a certain proportion of the entire national economy, so we must thoroughly eliminate the corrupt and degenerate ideas of the bourgeoisie in a swift and decisive manner, so as to change customs and habits politically and accumulate funds economically, shortening the process of our country moving from new democracy to socialism. We must not use various distorted statements to blur the central goal of this great movement.

Smashing the various illegal activities of the bourgeoisie cannot be done by one person alone. Due to the Chinese Communist Party's mass line style of work, the masses have truly been mobilized in this movement. Not only can employees report on shop owners, but also children can report on their fathers, truly forming a situation of encirclement and suppression from all sides. This is the greatest guarantee that we have absolute confidence in repelling the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie.

    用统计数字驳宽恕资产阶级猖狂进攻的种种说法
    九三学社中央常务理事北京师范大学、辅仁大学教授  孟宪章
    民族资产阶级是组成中国人民民主统一战线的四个阶级之一。过去曾有若干进步的民族资本家参加革命；自解放以后，在发展生产，繁荣经济，抗美援朝捐献，纳税竞赛方面，也有不少工商业者表现了一定的积极作用。毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中说：“由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级与中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利以后，在一个长时期内，还是必须允许他们存在；并且按照国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济的部分有一个发展。”中央人民政府成立后，在各级人民政府中，在各地协商委员会和人民代表会议中，也都有很多的民族资本家参加。甚至在一九五○年三月财政收支统一、物价稳定后，过去倚靠通货膨胀，畸形繁荣的工商业，纷纷倒闭，政府并用贷款、加工、定货、收购成品等办法，大力予以扶植，使得度过难关。民族资本家像这样在政治上经济上所享受的优遇，是在反动政府时代所绝对梦想不到的。
    但是，资产阶级本身具有损人利己、假公济私、不择手段、惟利是图、腐化堕落的本质。如当政府调整工商业时，他们多不把政府贷借或定货之款作正当经营，而竟用于投机倒把，贪图暴利；而对政府加工原料，则以少报多，用坏顶好。大运毒犯马鸿藻等并利用铁路行车便利、走私贩运大烟土五千四百五十多两，料面一千一百二十两。而对于供应中国人民志愿军的医药、橡胶腿、菜类、棉服，亦设法掺假，甚至竟盗运战略物资资敌。如一九五○年秋奸商曾其滔曾运锡出口达二十七万公斤以上（见叶剑英一月三十一日在广州市第四届第三次各界人民代表会议上的报告）。他们利用拉过去、派进来的手段侵蚀各个国家机关、国营企业。根据全国各地针对资产阶级对国家和人民的猖狂进攻所展开的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动中的统计材料，在北京，坦白和检举者达十五万件，牵涉三万余工商业户，国家机关国营企业干部之犯贪污罪者百分之八、九十和工商界有关。二月三日彭真同志在政务院第一百二十二次政务会议上的报告，迄今为止，在北京工商界中已经查出以行贿、偷工减料和盗窃经济情报等不法手段，盗窃国家财产在一千万元以上者有九百八十九家，其中盗窃一亿元以上的一百九十二家，就盗窃了国家资财二千亿元以上。二月七日刘澜涛同志在华北区节约检查委员会上的报告，天津市坦白检举材料达十六万余件，根据天津税务局初步的极不完全的结算，解放以来天津不法工商业者仅偷漏国税一项即达八千亿元以上。又据该局一九五一年下半年私营工商业税源调查，在被调查的一千八百零七户中，偷税的达百分之八十二，共一千四百九十户。去年十二月十七日饶漱石同志在华东一级机关干部大会上的动员报告，据华东人民监察委员会自一九五○年六月到一九五一年十一月处理贪污案件的统计，因个人贪污而造成国家财产的损失数达人民币一千二百四十二亿元。在一月中旬，上海工商界扩大代表会议中，仅奸商竺培农一人即坦白在报缴一九五○年所得税时曾偷漏税款一百十八亿二千多万元。一月二十日习仲勋同志在西北大行政区一级机关处长以上干部大会上的报告，西北仅西安市工商业者已坦白和检举出向干部行贿达人民币五十四亿，由此达到偷漏税款和盗窃国家财产大于此数很多倍。截至二月初，西安检举不法工商业者的非法事实已近六千件。在武汉，截至二月一日止，检举不法商人的案件已有九千三百多件。在重庆，除以前曾检举七千多件外，仅二月一日全市店员代表大会上，即检举一千四百八十二件，且曾破获私营钢铁机器业奸商秘密组织“星四聚餐会”，收买国营企业人员，垄断政府加工定货，有组织有计划地盗窃国家财产一百二十多亿元以上的严重案件。在广州，仅酿酒业偷漏的税款，只货物税一项即在一百一十亿元以上。据沈阳朱其文市长在一月二十六日沈阳市工商界代表会上的报告，仅根据一九五一年一至四月工商界反偷漏税运动中自己坦白的，就有一万四千余户，加上政府检查出来的共有二万一千余户，几占沈阳市工商业户的三分之二以上。以上种种材料，都证明资产阶级正用种种卑鄙恶毒手段，腐蚀革命政权，破坏经济建设，它不仅在进攻，而且是非常猖狂的了。
    有人说，资产阶级既无武力，也无组织，说猖狂进攻，未免有点过火，太刺激了。而不知他们所用的拉过去，派进来的手段，正在腐蚀革命阵营中一部分干部，使腐化堕落，甚至脱离革命。中国有句古话：“攻心为上，攻城次之”，它这种进攻，实在比军事进攻更恶毒。南斯拉夫铁托集团之所以叛变革命，正是资产阶级猖狂进攻的结果。对于资产阶级这一猖狂进攻，大张旗鼓地予以反击，正是为了使他们在霹雳一声雷之下，赶快猛省，安分守己地在中国工人阶级和国营经济领导之下，遵守共同纲领，共同从事新民主主义经济建设，这样做，实挽救了一部分不法工商业者，一点并不刺激。
    有人说，对于资产阶级如此攻击，未免有损资产阶级尊严，影响团结。不知中国工商业，在目前物价稳定，行庄存款利率不过一分左右，放款利率也不过二三分的情形之下，一般利润平均在十五分到三十分，不法资本家竟还不知满足，而用种种非法手段，获取百分之百甚至更多的暴利，这一部分人，已经不是朋友而是敌人，对敌人只有发挥阶级仇恨，依照国家法律，严厉惩罚，还能顾及什么尊严！毛主席曾根据实践告诉我们：“用斗争求团结，则团结存；用退让求团结，则团结亡”。我们这样做，正是巩固团结，加强团结。
    有人说，“物必先腐也而后虫生之”，假使国家机关、国营企业干部，无官僚主义作风，无贪污浪费现象，资产阶级如何能乘虚而入？这也是一种掩饰资产阶级罪恶、麻痹一般人警惕性的说法。人民政府是中国历史上空前廉洁而有效率的政府。不过我们新政权是建立在几千年旧社会废墟上，特别是在伪政府时代，因官僚资本残酷剥削人民，使贪污恶习侵蚀全国，这种恶习当然不是在两三年内可以肃清的。国家机关、国营企业的一部分干部固然有弱点，但若不是资产阶级用声色货利等糖衣炮弹，加以进攻，也许不至如此腐化堕落。且根据科学，是细菌先侵入而后物腐朽，并不是物先腐朽而后细菌侵入。苏联快进入共产主义，最近仍强调肃清资产阶级思想残余。我国私人资本主义经济，仍在全部国民经济中占有一定的比重，更要雷厉风行地对资产阶级腐化堕落思想加以彻底肃清，才能在政治上移风易俗，在经济上积累资金，缩短我国由新民主主义进到社会主义的过程，决不可用种种歪曲说法，模糊了这一伟大运动的中心目标。
    粉碎资产阶级的种种不法活动，决不是一个人所能干的。由于中国共产党依靠群众的作风，在这次运动中，群众真正是发动起来了，不惟职工可以检举店主，而且子女可以检举父亲，真正形成了一个四面八方围剿的形势，这是我们有绝对把握击退资产阶级猖狂进攻的最大保证。
