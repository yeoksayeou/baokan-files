    The struggle on the Korean railway front is a major component of the struggle on the Korean transportation front. The vast majority of supplies provided by the people of the motherland to support the front are transported by railway.

    Our victory on this front is great. After the summer of 1951, the U.S. air bandits, facing increasingly strong anti-aircraft fire and attacks from our People's Air Force, significantly weakened their air raid capabilities in Korea. However, the U.S. air bandits' bombing of the railway lines became even more frequent than before. They adopted a "focused bombing" tactic, attempting to cut off our transportation lines at certain key sections. The U.S. bandits paid an even heavier price for this "focused bombing." For example, in one area less than ten kilometers long, over four thousand bombs were dropped in the three months after August, with the ground on both sides of the railway line covered with layers of large and small bomb craters. But what was the result? Our steel rails and sleepers were still laid neatly, and our transportation capacity grew stronger and stronger. We not only defeated the U.S. air bandits, but also overcame natural disasters. Last autumn, Korea experienced its largest flood in forty years. In the month and a half from late July to the end of August, floods washed away dozens of railway bridges. This was even more serious than the damage caused by U.S. air raids. One of our companies rebuilt a pontoon bridge eleven times, but each time it was washed away by the flood. However, this company did not lose heart and finally rebuilt the pontoon bridge on the twelfth attempt. In the raging torrents, our commanders and fighters used sleepers and timbers as "lifebuoys," jumping into the water to salvage the washed-away materials. Five soldiers from one company were swept more than twenty miles away by the flood while trying to salvage materials. Commanders and fighters from another company salvaged six hundred sleepers, square timbers, and round logs in three hours. After overcoming the flood, the soldiers proudly said, "We can defeat such a big flood, what are we afraid of the U.S. air bandits bragging about!"

    The great victory on the transportation front was achieved first and foremost because the Chinese and Korean People's Railway troops, the Chinese railway volunteer aid-Korea workers, and the Korean railway workers possessed a spirit of heroic struggle and boundless creativity. The heroes not only selflessly rushed to repair and transport, but also accumulated rich experience in combat, greatly improving their technical skills.

    The heroic deeds on the transportation line are endless. I will only tell two short stories here. At 2:00 PM on February 19, 1951, enemy aircraft dropped more than eighty bombs on a certain station, damaging all five tracks and leaving behind more than twenty time bombs. The railway bureau initially proposed that repairs be carried out after the time bombs were defused. However, the comrades of the First Company of a certain unit, who took the initiative to request to carry out the repairs, said, "If we wait until the time bombs are defused before repairing, it will delay the resumption of traffic for a considerable amount of time. Let's repair first, getting the traffic running is the most important thing." So they immediately started repairing the lines. During the repair, two time bombs exploded, with bomb fragments landing near them and earth clods falling on them. The old foreman, Shao Yunwen, was injured in the arm by the explosion, but he still insisted on working. All the comrades in the company put forward the slogan, "We must repair one track by tonight so that the supplies donated by the people of the motherland can be quickly transported to the front." In just one and a half hours, they completed eighty cubic meters of earthwork and repaired more than one hundred meters of track. That night, all the commanders and fighters in the company were so happy that they couldn't sleep, only wanting to hear the sound of trains passing by and calculating how many trains were going to the front.

    One night, driver Liu Dun'gao was driving a train carrying ammunition to the front when enemy aircraft dropped flares over the train. He opened the throttle wide and rushed out of the flare circle at the fastest speed. The enemy aircraft strafed several times, setting the last car on fire. He quickly stopped the train and, together with the stoker, braved the threat of enemy aircraft circling and strafing to unhook the last car and quickly drove the train into a cave, avoiding the loss of all the supplies on the train.

    The creativity of the railway troops' commanders and fighters and the railway workers is even more astonishing. For example, they prepared all parts of the bridges in advance during peacetime, which could reduce the repair time by half. In preventing bridge damage and reducing losses, they also came up with many specific measures. Due to the continuous study of technology by the commanders and fighters and the railway workers, the speed of erecting trestles, installing steel beams, and digging frozen soil and filling bomb craters has been greatly improved. Many innovations and inventions have emerged in various tasks. For example, Zhang Lixing, a Communist Party member and platoon leader of the Ninth Company of a certain unit, and Peng Naijiu, Yuan Shimin, the squad leaders, and Qi Yuanxin, the ironworker, invented an adjustable wrench, which increased the efficiency of tightening screws by three to four times. An Guodong, a fifty-year-old foreman and Communist Party member of a certain unit, created a lightweight combination square, which could be used to measure level, height, and track gauge. Liu Min, a Communist Party member and company commander of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, invented a "detection shovel," which could detect cracks in steel rails at night. Qi Tonghan, a platoon leader of the First Platoon of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, created a trestle model board, which could be used to make trestles and drill screw holes even without lighting at night. In the absence of tools, the blacksmith squads of our various companies started from scratch on the Korean battlefield, using broken U.S. gasoline barrels to make blacksmith furnaces, using broken U.S. car axles to make crowbars and axes, and using U.S. shell casings to make planing blades and steel files, and also forged many kitchen knives for the Korean villagers. The soldiers composed a quick-rhythm rhyme saying: "Good, good, good, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, the U.S. sends good materials. Shell casings are good steel, can be used to make planing blades and kitchen knives, make good planing blades for carpenters, make good kitchen knives for the villagers." The soldiers were proactively collecting materials and thinking about saving time at all times. For example, the comrades of a certain regiment of the Korean Railway Repair Command used explosives from U.S. time bombs to blast rocks. Chen Xiwu, a soldier of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps, initiated the collection of stones during air raid defense time. It was this high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and creativity that enabled our troops to overcome all difficulties.

    Second, I want to talk about the role played by our People's Anti-Aircraft Artillery troops and the People's Air Force in protecting the railway transportation line, although these roles are only a part of the roles played by our anti-aircraft artillery troops and the People's Air Force. The strengthening of anti-aircraft fire and the dispatch of the People's Air Force have already inflicted serious losses on the U.S. air bandits, and have made them tremble with fear when bombing the railway lines. The following are the facts I witnessed in a certain place. After our anti-aircraft artillery troops arrived in the construction area on December 15, they shot down four enemy aircraft and damaged three enemy aircraft the next day; the third day they shot down three enemy aircraft and damaged five enemy aircraft. I personally saw that when our People's Air Force appeared, the U.S. bombers fled south in panic, like mice seeing a cat. In the sky above the location of our troops, we often saw enemy aircraft shot down by our heroic Air Force. With the protection of the anti-aircraft artillery troops and the People's Air Force, our troops not only accelerated the repair time, but also improved the quality of the lines.

    Third, the reason why we were able to defeat the enemy is also because the various repair units on the railway front, the employees of various stations, and between the repair units and the railway bureau, are filled with a spirit of patriotism, internationalism, unity and friendship. When the area under the jurisdiction of our troops was severely bombed, the Korean railway troops and the volunteer aid-Korea railway workers rushed to help. When the area under the jurisdiction of the Korean railway troops was severely bombed, we also took the initiative to go to reinforce. This is also the case between the various companies of our troops. Our unity is not only manifested in mutual assistance, but also in mutual learning. If this part has new repair experiences and methods, it will immediately notify other parts, and other parts will send people to learn. Precisely because we can learn from each other and help each other, although the enemy is very cunning, we can quickly concentrate our strength, so that the damaged lines, stations, and bridges can be quickly repaired. In addition to the above three points, the encouragement given to us by the victories of the front-line troops and the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland and the Korean people are even more important factors for our victory. The people along the Korean railway line were busy with the autumn harvest during the day last year, and they also helped us pick up stones and fill bomb craters at night. In winter, Korean old women in their sixties and seventies braved wind and snow to send us straw bags, wine, and eggs from dozens of miles away, which gave us great help and encouragement. All the comrades of the Volunteer Army Railway Technical Corps and the volunteer aid-Korea railway workers must continue to work hard, continue to improve our repair speed and transportation speed on the Korean railway front, vigorously increase production and practice economy, in response to the call of Chairman Mao and Commander Peng Dehuai, and answer the love and care of the people of the motherland for us.

    朝鲜铁道运输线上的伟大胜利是怎样取得的
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　简群
    朝鲜铁道战线斗争是朝鲜运输战线斗争的一个主要组成部分，祖国人民支援给前线的物资，极大部分是靠铁道运到前方的。
    在这条战线上，我们的胜利是伟大的。一九五一年夏季以后，美国空中强盗受到我方愈来愈强的对空射击和人民空军的打击，对朝鲜的空袭力量大大减弱了。可是美国空中强盗对铁路线的轰炸则比以前更加频繁，他们采取了什么“重点轰炸”战术，妄想在某些重要地段上截断我们的运输线。美国强盗为这个“重点轰炸”付出了更惨重的代价。例如在某地一个不到十公里的地段上，在八月以后的三个月中，就投下了四千多个炸弹，线路两旁堆满重重叠叠大大小小的弹坑。可是结果怎样呢？我们的钢轨枕木还铺得齐齐整整，我们的运输力却愈来愈强。我们不独战胜了美国的空中强盗，还战胜了自然灾害。去年秋季，朝鲜曾发生四十年来最大的一次洪水，在七月下旬到八月末的一个多月中，洪水冲坏了铁路桥梁几十座。这比美国飞机轰炸的破坏还严重得多。我们有一个连队修了十一次浮桥，都被洪水冲坏，可是这个连队毫不灰心，终于在第十二次把浮桥修起。在滚滚的洪涛中，我们的指战员们用枕木、方木作“救生圈”，跳下水去抢救被冲走的材料。某连有五个战士为了抢救材料，曾被洪水冲到二十几里以外。某连指战员在三小时内抢捞出枕木、方木、圆木六百根。战士们在战胜洪水之后，自豪地说：“这样大的洪水，我们能把它战胜，还怕美国空中强盗吹什么牛皮！”
    运输战线上伟大胜利的取得，首先是由于中朝人民铁道部队、中国铁路志愿援朝员工和朝鲜铁路员工具有英勇斗争的精神和无穷的创造力。英雄们不独忘我地去抢修、抢运，而且在战斗中积累了丰富的经验，大大提高了自己的技术水平。
    运输线上的英勇事迹是说不完的。我在这里只讲两个小故事。一九五一年二月十九日下午两点，敌机在某地车站投弹八十多枚，把五股线路都炸坏了，还留下了二十几枚定时炸弹。路局当时提出，排除定时炸弹以后再抢修。可是主动要求去抢修的某部
    一连同志们说：“如果排除定时炸弹以后再修，得耽误不少通车时间，先抢修吧，通车要紧。”于是他们立刻动手修线路。抢修时有两枚定时炸弹爆炸，弹皮落在他们身边，炸起的土块落在他们身上，老监工员邵运文臂部炸伤了，仍旧坚持工作。全连同志提出口号：“要在当夜修通一股线路，让祖国人民捐献的物资赶快运到前方。”就这样，只有一点半钟，他们就完成土方八十方，修复一百多公尺长的线路。当天晚上，全连指战员们高兴得觉都睡不着，光想听一听火车通过的声音，计算着有多少列车开到前线去。
    有一天晚上司机刘敦高，开着输送弹药的列车去前线，敌机在列车上空投照明弹。他把汽门大开，用最快的速度冲出照明弹圈。敌机扫射几次，把最后一辆车皮打着了火。他迅速地停住了车，带着司炉冒着敌机盘旋扫射的威胁，把最后一辆车皮挂钩摘开，把列车飞快地开到山洞里。全车物资得以避免损失。
    铁道部队指战员和铁路员工的创造力更是惊人的。譬如他们把桥梁各部分在平时做好备用，可以减少一半抢修的时间。在防止桥梁炸坏减少损失方面；他们也想出了许多具体办法。由于指战员、铁路员工不断地钻研技术，立排架的速度，架钢梁的速度和挖冻土、平复弹坑的速度都大大的提高了。各种工作中都出现了许多创造发明。例如，某部九连共产党员排长张立兴、班长彭耐久、袁世民和铁工戚元新等发明了活动螺丝搬，使上螺丝的工作效率提高三倍到四倍。某部五十岁的监工员、共产党员安国栋创造出一种轻便的三合尺，用这种三合尺可以测量水平、高度和轨距。某部五连连长共产党员刘敏发明了“探险铲”，可在夜间探出钢轨的裂纹。某部四连一排长齐通汉创造了排架模型板，黑夜没有照明一样可以做排架、钻螺丝眼。在缺乏工具的情况下，我们各连的铁匠班在朝鲜战场上白手起家，用美国破汽油桶做铁匠炉，用美国的破汽车轮轴做撬棍、斧子等等，用美国的炮弹皮做刨刃钢锉，还打了不少菜刀送给朝鲜老乡。战士们编了一个快板说：“好好好，妙妙妙，美国送来好材料。炮弹皮，是好钢，能做刨刃和菜刀，打好刨刃给木匠，打好菜刀送老乡。”战士们每时每刻主动地在搜集材料和想法节省时间。例如朝鲜铁路抢修指挥局某联队的同志，利用美国定时炸弹里的炸药炸石头。志愿军铁道兵团某部五连战士陈希武发起在防空时间拣石头。就是这样高度的爱国主义国际主义精神和创造力，使我们的部队战胜了一切困难。
    第二，我要说一说我们人民高射炮部队和人民空军在保护铁道运输线中所起的作用，虽则这些作用仅仅是我们高射炮部队和人民空军所起的作用的一部分。对空射击的加强和人民空军的出动，已经使美国空中强盗遭受了严重的损失，而且使他们在轰炸铁道线时胆战心惊。下面是我在某地亲眼看见的事实。十二月十五日我们的高射炮部队来到施工地区以后，第二天就打下了四架敌机，打伤了三架敌机；第三天又打下了三架敌机，打伤了五架敌机。我曾亲眼看见，当我们人民空军出现的时候，美国的轰炸机好像老鼠见了猫似的，仓惶向南逃窜。在我们部队驻地的上空，经常看见被我们英勇的空军所击落的敌机。我们部队有了高射炮部队和人民空军的保护，不独使抢修时间加快，而且能够改进线路的质量。
    第三，我们所以能够战胜敌人，还由于我们在铁道战线上的各个抢修部队、各个车站的员工以及在抢修部队和路局之间，充满着爱国主义国际主义团结友爱的精神。当我们部队管内地区被炸严重时，朝鲜铁道部队和志愿援朝铁路员工就赶来援助，当朝鲜铁道部队管内地区被炸严重时，我们也主动前去增援。在我们部队各连队之间，也是如此。我们的团结还不仅表现在互相增援上，而且也表现在互相学习上。这个部分有新的抢修经验和办法，马上通知别的部分，别的部分就派人前去学习。正因为我们能互相学习，互相增援，敌人虽然非常狡猾，但我们能很快地集中力量，使被破坏的线路、车站、桥梁，能很快修复。除了上述三点以外，前方部队打胜仗给我们的鼓舞和祖国人民、朝鲜人民的热烈支援，则是使我们取得胜利的更重要的因素。朝鲜铁路沿线的人民群众，他们去年白天忙着秋收，晚上还帮我们拣石头和填弹坑。在冬天，六七十岁的朝鲜老大娘还冒着风雪从几十里外给我们送草袋、送酒、送鸡蛋，这给我们莫大的帮助和鼓励。我们志愿军铁道技术部队、志愿援朝铁路员工全体同志一定要继续努力，在朝鲜铁道战线上，继续提高我们的抢修速度和运输速度，厉行增产节约，以响应毛主席和彭德怀司令员的号召，回答祖国人民对我们的热爱和关怀。
