Xu Zuliang, the head of the Foreign Exchange Business Section, concurrently head of the Foreign Exchange Management Section, and Deputy Director of the Barter Exchange of the Bank of China Qingdao Branch, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to steal national economic intelligence and illegally engaged in import and export trade, causing tangible losses of more than 700 million yuan to the country.

Xu was a businessman by background, graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai, and studied in the United States. Before liberation, he served as Assistant Manager and Foreign Exchange Director of the bureaucratic capital Bank of China Qingdao Branch. After liberation, he was retained by the People's Government to serve as the head of the Foreign Exchange Business Section, concurrently head of the Foreign Exchange Management Section, and Deputy Director of the Barter Exchange of the Bank of China Qingdao Branch.

In order to use his position to steal a large amount of national assets, Xu Zuliang colluded with unscrupulous merchants such as Feng Zhensheng, Shi Boxuan, and Teng Mingke to establish "Huasheng Trading Company." The unscrupulous merchant Feng Zhensheng fled to Shanghai on the eve of Qingdao's liberation. After Qingdao's liberation, in December 1949, Xu wrote a letter to summon Feng back to Qingdao to resume business (Huasheng Trading Company was established before liberation). According to the materials Xu has already admitted, his investment in Huasheng Trading Company accounted for 40%. Since liberation, he has told Huasheng Trading Company almost every piece of economic intelligence and planned the business of Huasheng Trading Company. Feng Zhensheng often went to Xu Zuliang's office, and the two secretly talked. Outsiders said that Huasheng Trading Company had ways, with little capital but well-informed, and was well-connected at the Bank of China.

In December 1950, the US dollar was frozen, and the superior decided to do its best to collect foreign exchange loans. However, Xu told Huasheng Trading Company about this news. At this time, all import and export merchants' foreign exchange loans were gradually recovered, but Xu did not recover Huasheng Trading Company's 330 million yuan foreign exchange loan; this loan has not been repaid until now. The Business Section of the Bank of China Qingdao Branch wanted Xu to urge Huasheng Trading Company to repay the loan, but Xu not only did not urge the repayment, but also advocated that no interest be charged on this loan. This loan has been overdue for thirteen months, and this item alone has caused a loss of 34.34 million yuan to the country. In April 1950, Qingdao foreign merchant Jia Lai Foreign Company and other merchants competed to sell peanuts abroad. Because the foreign prices dropped, the deals were not concluded. Later, the Qingdao Foreign Trade Bureau decided to lower the floor price of peanuts so that they could be sold abroad. Before this decision was announced, Xu told Huasheng Trading Company this economic secret, and Huasheng Trading Company concluded the business first, immediately exporting 285 tons of peanuts, making a net profit of 830 million yuan.

Around October 1950, the General Office of the Bank of China instructed to vigorously support exports. Xu also suggested to the Business Section that loans should be shifted to exports in the future. Soon, Huasheng Trading Company imported carbolic acid. However, Xu indirectly asked the loan staff of the Business Section, "Can import loans be supported?" The answer was, "No." After Huasheng Trading Company's loan application was rejected, Xu used his position to introduce Feng Zhensheng to apply for a loan from other designated banks.

In October 1951, Huasheng Trading Company bought a batch of goods abroad. At that time, it entrusted the Bank of China Qingdao Branch to issue a letter of guarantee to Hong Kong for HK$72,732, stipulating payment upon arrival of the goods. According to regulations, when issuing a letter of guarantee, a deposit of 50% to 80% should be required from private merchants. However, Xu only charged Huasheng Trading Company a 10% deposit for the letter of guarantee. This item alone caused a loss of 10.09 million yuan to the country.

Xu Zuliang's crimes of illegally colluding with domestic and foreign unscrupulous merchants and designated banks, illegally facilitating transactions, and leaking secrets to merchants, resulting in losses to national assets, are numerous. Only a few examples are cited here. Qingdao foreign merchant Jia Lai Foreign Company mainly engaged in the export of peanuts and peanut oil. Xu sold national economic intelligence to Jia Lai Foreign Company and accepted bribes. In the autumn of 1950, according to the instructions of the superior, the Bank of China Qingdao Branch did not handle US dollar packing loans. However, at this time, Jia Lai Foreign Company exported a large amount of peanuts and peanut oil, with extremely high profits, and requested packing loans for support. Xu used his position to introduce Jia Lai Foreign Company to the foreign exchange bank designated by the Bank of China for packing loans. It happened that the designated bank lacked US dollars, and Xu used his position to agree that the designated bank could deposit the loan to Jia Lai Foreign Company in the account of the Bank of China Qingdao Branch; and it was agreed in advance that the transferred funds would not be transferred and would still be deposited in the designated bank; and secretly told the designated bank to withhold the foreign exchange collected on behalf of the Bank of China Qingdao Branch as compensation. This was equivalent to the Bank of China Qingdao Branch granting a loan to Jia Lai Foreign Company, making the Bank of China Qingdao Branch bear the risk of freezing foreign exchange, and at the same time enabling the designated bank to use state funds to do loan business. Because Jia Lai Foreign Company had this foreign exchange, it made two peanut oil export deals. The issuance of this foreign exchange caused a loss of more than 600 million yuan to the country. Xu also admitted that he had leaked the foreign exchange position information of import companies to private merchants. In addition, several foreign trade messages from the documents of the private merchant Rongcheng Trading Company were also found to have come from Xu.

The following are the facts of Xu's collusion with the private merchant Silian Company. It was common for Xu to accept gifts from Silian Company. Silian Company once imported goods for import and export companies. In principle, it should be on the condition of telegraphic transfer upon arrival of the goods. However, because Silian Company's foreign funds were not abundant, Xu used the method of introduction without issuing purchase certificates or letters of guarantee, and even noted in the telegram that the goods were guaranteed to be telegraphed upon arrival, thus using the credit of the national bank and making the national bank bear the risk. No collateral was collected, no certificate opening fee or deposit was collected, and no loan account was used, and no interest was charged. This was blatant illegal collusion with Silian Company. From July to September 1951, Silian Company made a total of five transactions, using HK$988,588.40. In terms of interest and handling fees that should have been received from the country alone, a total of RMB 65.8 million was lost.

In addition, Xu also colluded with Qingdao private merchant Rongcheng Trading Company, Hong Kong Huafeng Company, and others.

The above facts are only a part of the materials initially discovered. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Xu stubbornly adopted an extremely wrong attitude of refusing to confess, refusing to reform, undermining the movement, and minimizing his guilt. At the beginning of the democratic review, he used all means to win people over. For example, he used his hometown relationship to win over Hu Zhongying and others from the Foreign Exchange Business Section; he also used rhetoric to win over Qiu Chaoguang and others from the Foreign Exchange Management Section; and he invited some people to dinner on December 31. He attacked activists and increased their workload, leaving activists with no time to participate in political activities. In addition, he also went to relevant businesses to arrange and establish an "offensive and defensive alliance."

Although Xu was so despicable and shameless, the leading cadres and comrades still painstakingly educated him and tried to save him. Manager Xing Gangming alone had individual talks with him seven or eight times, trying to inspire him to confess his crimes. However, he refused them all.

On January 19, the staff of the Bank of China Qingdao Branch held an anti-corruption meeting. Xu Zuliang was arrested on the spot. (Qu Minsheng)

    中国银行青岛分行外汇业务科科长
    大贪污犯徐祖廉拒不坦白已被逮捕
    徐犯勾结奸商盗窃国家经济情报使国家损失七亿多元
    中国银行青岛分行外汇业务科科长兼外汇管理科科长及易货交易所副主任徐祖廉，勾结奸商，利用职权盗窃国家经济情报、非法经营进出口贸易，给国家造成有形损失达七亿多元。
    徐犯是商人出身，上海圣约翰大学毕业，曾留学美国。解放前曾担任官僚资本中国银行青岛分行的襄理兼外汇主任；解放后被人民政府留用，担任中国银行青岛分行外汇业务科科长兼外汇管理科科长及易货交易所副主任。
    徐祖廉为了利用职权大量盗窃国家资财，和奸商冯真胜、石伯宣、滕名可等相勾结，办“华盛商行”。奸商冯真胜在青岛解放前夕，逃往上海。青岛解放后，一九四九年十二月，徐犯写信召冯回青岛复业（解放前就开设了华盛商行）。根据徐犯已经承认的材料，他在华盛商行的投资占百分之四十。解放以来，他几乎把每个时期的经济情报都告诉了华盛商行，并且谋划华盛商行的业务。冯真胜经常到徐祖廉的办公室里，两人鬼鬼祟祟地密谈。外界都说华盛商行有办法，本钱虽少，但消息灵通，在中国银行吃得开。
    一九五○年十二月，美金冻结，上级决定尽力催收外汇放款，徐犯却将这个消息告诉了华盛商行。这时所有进出口商的外汇借款都陆续收回，徐犯却不收回华盛商行的三亿三千万元的外汇借款；到现在这笔借款也没有还清。中国银行青岛分行业务科曾要徐向华盛商行催收，徐不但不催收，反主张这笔款不收利息。这笔借款已过期十三个月，只这一项，便给国家造成三千四百三十四万元的损失。一九五○年四月，青岛市外商嘉赉洋行及其他商号争向国外出售花生米，因国外价格下跌，没有成交。后来青岛市外贸局决定调低花生米的底价，使到国外能够销售。这项决定还没有公布，徐却把这项经济秘密告诉华盛商行，华盛商行就先成交了生意，立即出口花生米二百八十五吨，净赚八亿三千万元。
    一九五○年十月间，中国银行总处指示大力扶持出口，徐犯也向业务科建议今后贷款转向出口。不久，华盛商行有石碳酸进口了，徐犯却又向业务科贷款股人员转弯抹角地问：“进口贷款是否可以扶持？”回答说：“不可以。”华盛商行要贷款的事被拒绝后，徐犯却利用职权介绍冯真胜到其他指定的银行申请贷款。
    一九五一年十月，华盛商行在国外买进一批商品，当时委托中国银行青岛分行向香港开出担保书计港币七万二千七百三十二元，规定货到付款。根据规定开担保书时，要向私商要五成至八成的保证金。但徐对华盛商行开的担保书只收一成保证金。这一项就给国家造成一千零九万元的损失。
    徐祖廉非法勾结国内外奸商及指定银行，非法通融，向商人泄露机密，致使国家资财遭受损失的罪行很多，这里只举几个例子。青岛市外商嘉赉洋行，主要业务是经营出口花生米和花生油等。徐犯向嘉赉洋行出卖国家经济情报，从中受贿。一九五○年秋天，中国银行青岛分行根据上级指示，不办理美金打包放款。但这时嘉赉洋行大量出口花生米和花生油，利润极厚，要求打包放款扶持。徐犯利用职权，介绍嘉赉洋行到中国银行指定的外汇银行去做打包借款。恰好指定银行缺少美金，徐又利用职权答应那个指定银行把给嘉赉洋行的放款移存在中国银行青岛分行的账上；并且事先串通好了，移存的头寸不调拨，仍旧存放在指定银行；并密告指定银行扣押代中国银行青岛分行收妥的外汇抵补。这样就等于中国银行青岛分行放款给嘉赉洋行一样，使中国银行青岛分行担负冻结外汇的风险，同时又使那个指定银行利用国家资金做了放款生意。由于嘉赉洋行有了这笔外汇，便做了两笔花生油出口的生意。这笔外汇的发出，使国家遭受六亿多元的损失。徐犯也承认曾泄露进口公司外汇头寸消息给私商。此外，从私商荣成行的文电中查出有若干对外贸易消息也是来自徐处。
    下面是徐犯和私商四联公司勾结的事实。徐犯接受四联公司馈赠是常事。四联公司曾替进出口公司进货，原则上应该是以货到电汇为条件，但因四联公司国外头寸不丰，徐就用介绍的办法不开购买证及保证信，竟在电报中注明保证货到电汇，这样就利用了国家银行的信用，使国家银行担负风险。既不收押品，也不收开证费及押金，更不走放款账，不收利息，这是明目张胆的和四联公司的非法勾通。查自一九五一年七月到九月，四联公司先后共做五笔生意，用港币九十八万八千五百八十八元四分，仅从国家应收的利息及手续费来说，就共损失人民币六千五百八十万元。
    此外，徐犯还和青岛市私商荣成行、香港华丰公司等都有勾搭。
    上述事实，还只是初步发现的材料中的一部分。在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的运动开展之后，徐犯顽固地采取拒不坦白、拒绝改造、破坏运动、避重就轻的极端错误态度。在民主检查开始时，他用尽了各种手段进行拉拢。例如曾利用同乡关系拉拢外汇业务科胡钟英等；又花言巧语拉拢外汇管理科邱朝光等；并且在十二月三十一日请一些人吃饭。他对积极分子加以打击，并加重他的业务工作，使积极分子没有参加政治活动的余暇。此外他还到有关商号布置，订立“攻守同盟”。
    虽然徐犯这样卑鄙无耻，然而领导干部和同志们还曾苦口婆心地教育他、挽救他，只经理邢刚明就和他进行个别谈话七、八次之多，想启发他坦白自己的罪行。然而他全都拒绝了。
    一月十九日，中国银行青岛分行职工举行反贪污大会。徐犯祖廉已被当场逮捕。  （曲民生）
