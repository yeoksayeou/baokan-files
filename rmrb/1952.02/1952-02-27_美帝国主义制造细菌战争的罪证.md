Evidence of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare Crimes

    The American aggressors' monstrous crime of using bacteriological weapons on a large scale on the Korean battlefield has enraged all righteous people in the world. All reliable materials prove that the American aggressors' manufacture and use of bacteriological weapons has been premeditated for a long time.

    After World War II, the scale of the United States' work in manufacturing bacteriological weapons expanded daily. At the end of 1946, the "New York Times" military observer Baldwin revealed: "Under the overall leadership of the Army Military Chemical Corps, experiments are continuing to manufacture several deadly poisons." The former US Army Military Chemical Corps Minister and the head of the US's germ warfare, White, boasted in early 1949 that the United States had made other countries "lag behind" in studying the issue of germ warfare weapons. By March 1951, Dr. Hyss, Director of the US National Institutes of Health, openly declared that "microbial shells and microbial bombs" had become weapons that could be realized immediately.

    The US government allocates huge amounts of money every year to invest in the evil cause of preparing for germ warfare. Camp Detrick, near Washington, DC, is the base for the US to prepare for germ warfare. There is a large-scale bacteriological laboratory there, led by the US Army Military Chemical Corps. According to former US Secretary of Defense Johnson, the United States spends more than 12 million US dollars a year on this evil work. This laboratory was established as early as 1943, and has been continuously expanded since then. By June 1944, the number of researchers in the laboratory had reached 3,900. In this laboratory, murderers are studying how to cultivate and spread bacteria such as plague, cholera, and typhoid fever. Other laboratories for testing bacteriological weapons are located in Mississippi, Utah, and Indiana.

    In the large-scale preparation for germ warfare, the American aggressors have made full use of the Japanese germ warfare criminals and their evil experience. The notorious MacArthur established a germ warfare research institute in the mountainous area near Tokyo, Japan, as the "central headquarters" of Japanese germ warfare research. This institute was composed of all former Japanese germ warfare experts, headed by the major germ warfare criminal Shiro Ishii. In March 1951, in order to engage in the large-scale manufacture of bacteriological weapons, the Ishii Bacteriological Research Institute, through the Special Procurement Bureau of the Prime Minister's Office of the Yoshida government, purchased 1.5 million yen worth of liquid fat for cultivating bacteria from Nishibetsuin Village and Higashibetsuin Village, Minamikuwada County, Kyoto Prefecture. All materials such as the research methods and results of the Ishii Institute, as well as work plans and timetables, were handed over to the American Detrick Camp through the Japanese US military staff headquarters. In addition, some Japanese germ warfare experts are engaged in research on the manufacture of bacteriological weapons in the United States.

    The US government has also made full use of Hitler's germ warfare experts and their experience. On February 10, 1950, a US State Department representative announced that 600 German scientists were working in laboratories and research institutes led by the US Army Department. The Antara factory laboratory in Bielefeld, West Germany, the "Koch Institute", Professor Flexner's Research Office, the Tubingen Biochemical Research Institute, and the Farben Industry Research Institute in Wuppertal have all received large subsidies from the American military authorities. In the Tubingen Biochemical Research Institute, germ warfare experts have studied the fastest-growing bacteria and the medium to promote bacterial growth.

    After the outbreak of the American aggression against Korea, the US military deliberately carried out germ warfare. When the American invading army retreated from northern Korea in 1950, this group of beasts spread smallpox bacteria in the northern Korean areas they had temporarily occupied, plotting to massacre a large number of Korean people and the Korean and Chinese People's armies. From mid-December 1950 to January 1951, several areas that were regained simultaneously discovered smallpox in the seven or eight days after liberation, while in recent years, smallpox had never been found in northern Korea. At that time, people with smallpox were suddenly found in Pyongyang, South Pyongan Province, North Pyongan Province, Gangwon Province, South Hamgyong Province, and Hwanghae Province, and the number of patients increased sharply. By April, more than 3,500 cases had been discovered, and 10% of the patients died. Smallpox was particularly prevalent in areas that were liberated later. 1,126 cases were found in Gangwon Province, 817 cases were found in South Hamgyong Province, and 602 cases were found in Hwanghae Province. However, no cases of smallpox were found in areas that were not occupied by the American aggressors. This heinous act of the American aggressors aroused the anger of righteous people all over the world.

    In addition to the above-mentioned crimes of using bacteriological weapons, the American aggressors have also systematically and barbarously used captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese People's armies for various bacteriological weapons experiments. In March 1951, the US military's No. 1091 bacterial landing craft secretly sailed to Wonsan Port on the east coast of Korea to conduct experiments on bacteriological weapons using captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. On April 9, the American "Newsweek" published news revealing this bloody incident. The news said: "Note the secret mission of a Navy experimental epidemic prevention ship. The ship has been sent to Wonsan Port on the east coast of North Korea." "This ship is an infantry landing craft with a laboratory, complete with mice and rabbits." The news also said: "The Marines grabbed some Chinese Communists from the small islands of the port and took them to the ship to test whether they already have symptoms of the terrible bubonic plague." Soon, the bacterial landing craft sailed to Geoje Island southwest of Busan. This island held prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army. At that time, the Associated Press reported that the ship's "laboratory obtained oral and intestinal bacterial cultures from patients in the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, conducting 3,000 tests every day." The ship's "20-foot square laboratory was crowded, and all 38 people were working hard." The results of the experiment were that "among the more than 125,000 North Korean prisoners," "1,400 people were very ill, and about 80 percent of the rest were infected with some kind of disease."

    The above facts fully illustrate that the recent large-scale use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea has been prepared for a long time; it also fully illustrates that American imperialism is the most cruel and dehumanizing murderous demon, and the deadly enemy of people all over the world. Therefore, as Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government pointed out in his statement on February 24: "Now American imperialism is using these tested bacteriological weapons to brutally kill the peaceful people of Korea. If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has fallen on the heads of the peaceful people of Korea today will fall on the heads of the peaceful people of the world tomorrow." For this reason, we must call on the peace-loving people of the world to immediately and urgently mobilize and resolutely stop this heinous crime of American imperialism; the people of the whole country must more actively support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and resolutely smash all the evil plans of the American aggressors.

### 美帝国主义制造细菌战争的罪证

    美帝国主义制造细菌战争的罪证
    美国侵略者最近在朝鲜战场上大规模地使用细菌武器的滔天罪行，震怒了全世界正义的人类。一切可靠的材料证明，美国侵略者制造和使用细菌武器是蓄谋已久的事。
    在第二次世界大战结束后，美国制造细菌武器的工作规模就日益扩展。一九四六年年底，“纽约时报”军事观察家包尔杜英曾透露：“在陆军军事化学部的总领导之下，正继续着制造若干致命毒物的试验。”前美国陆军军事化学部部长、美国进行细菌战的首脑人物怀特在一九四九年初曾吹嘘说：美国在研究细菌战争武器问题的这一方面，已使其他国家“望尘莫及”。到一九五一年三月，美国卫生研究院院长海斯就公然宣称：“微生物的炮弹和微生物的炸弹”已成为立即可能实现的武器。
    美国政府每年拨出巨额款项投入准备细菌战争的罪恶事业。在美国华盛顿附近的狄特里克营是美国准备细菌战的基地。那里设有一座规模巨大的细菌试验室，它由美国陆军军事化学部领导。据前美国国防部长詹森透露，美国每年在这个罪恶的工作上化费达一千二百万美元以上。这座试验室早在一九四三年建立，从那时起就不断地扩充，到一九四四年六月，该室研究人员已达三千九百人之多。在这座试验室中，杀人凶犯们研究着如何培植和传播鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒等细菌。另外一些试验细菌武器的试验室设立在密士失必州、犹他州和印第安纳州。
    美国侵略者在进行细菌战的大规模准备工作中，充分利用了日本细菌战犯和他们的罪恶经验。臭名昭彰的麦克阿瑟曾在日本东京附近山区里成立了细菌战研究所，作为日本细菌战研究的“中央总部”。这个研究所由所有以前的日本细菌战专家组成，并以大细菌战犯石井四郎为首脑。一九五一年三月，石井细菌研究所为了大规模地从事细菌武器的制造，曾由麦克阿瑟总部通过吉田政府总理府特别调达厅，向日本京都府南桑田郡西别院村、东别院村定购了一百五十万日圆的培制细菌用的液脂。石井研究所的研究方法和结果，以及工作计划和时期表等一切材料，都通过日本美军参谋部交给美国狄特里克营魔窟。此外，也有一些日本的细菌战专家在美国从事制造细菌武器的研究工作。
    美国政府同时也充分利用了希特勒的细菌战专家和他们的经验。一九五○年二月十日，美国国务院代表曾宣布，有六百名德国科学家在美国陆军部领导的实验室与研究所里工作。在西德俾雷腓尔德的安塔拉工厂试验室、“科赫研究所”、佛列克斯教授研究室、杜平根的生物化学研究所与窝伯特尔的法本工业研究所，都领到了美国军事当局的大量津贴。在杜平根生物化学研究所里，细菌战专家们曾研究繁殖最速的细菌，和研究促进细菌生长的媒介等。
    美国侵朝战争爆发后，美军就蓄意进行细菌战。当美国侵略军在一九五○年从朝鲜北部败退时，这群野兽就将天花细菌散布在他们暂时侵占过的北朝鲜地区，阴谋大批屠杀朝鲜人民和朝中人民军队。从一九五○年十二月中旬到一九五一年一月，重获解放的几个地区在解放后的七、八天中，同时发现了天花，而在最近几年中，北朝鲜地区是从未发现过天花的。当时，平壤市、平安南道、平安北道、江原道、咸镜南道、黄海道等地都突然发现患天花的人，患者人数并急遽地增加，到了四月间，就发现了三千五百件以上，患者百分之十死亡。在解放较晚的地区，天花的传染尤为流行。江原道发现了一千一百二十六件，咸镜南道发现了八百一十七件，黄海道发现了六百零二件。而在未被美国侵略者侵占过的地区，却都未发现患天花的人。美国侵略者这一万恶暴行曾激起了全世界正义人民的愤怒。
    除了上述使用细菌武器的罪行外，美国侵略者并有计划地、野蛮透顶地拿朝中人民军队被俘人员作各种细菌武器的实验。一九五一年三月间，美军的一艘第一○九一号细菌登陆艇，曾秘密开到朝鲜东海岸元山港，用中国人民志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验。四月九日，美国“新闻周刊”发表消息透露了这个血腥事件。该消息说：“请注意海军的一艘实验防疫的船只的秘密使命。这船已派至北朝鲜东海岸的元山港。”“这船是一艘步兵登陆艇，上设实验室，老鼠兔子俱全”。该消息还说：“海军陆战队从该港的小岛上抓了一些中国共产党，带到船上，试验他们是否已有可怖的黑死病的症候。”不久，该细菌登陆艇又开往釜山西南的巨济岛。这个岛上囚禁着朝鲜人民军的被俘人员。当时美联社的消息说：船上的“实验室自伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营的病人那里取得口与肠的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验”。该船“二十英尺见方的实验室挤得满满的，全体三十八个人都在全力地工作着”。而试验的结果，“关着十二万五千多北朝鲜俘虏”中，“有一千四百人病得很厉害，其余的人约有百分之八十染有某种疾病”。
    上述事实完全说明了美国侵略者最近在朝鲜大规模地使用细菌武器是经过有计划的长期准备的；也完全说明了美帝国主义是最残忍的、灭绝人性的杀人恶魔，是全世界人民的死敌。因此正如中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长二月二十四日声明中指出的：“现在美帝国主义就使用这些试验过的细菌武器，来虐杀朝鲜的和平人民。如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上。”为此，我们要号召全世界爱好和平的人民，立即紧张地动员起来，坚决制止美帝国主义的这一滔天罪行；全国人民要更加积极地支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，坚决粉碎美国侵略者的一切罪恶计划。（新华社）
