Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: The All-China Women's Federation issued a statement protesting the towering crimes of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria in Korea. The statement said:

The All-China Women's Federation, representing all Chinese women, lodges a serious protest against this inhuman act of American imperialism. We Chinese women, in order to defend peace and defend our motherland, have sent our dearest children and husbands to the front lines. We will never tolerate such brutal and inhumane acts of American imperialism. We will concentrate our efforts on increasing production and practicing economy, and continue to strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea, in order to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. At the same time, we hope that women around the world and all peace-loving people will unite to stop the atrocities of American imperialism.

This newspaper reports that the National Committee of the China Educational Workers' Union and the Beijing Committee have lodged serious protests against the towering crime of the US military's madly spreading bacteria in Korea. The National Committee of the China Educational Workers' Union, representing 1.3 million educators nationwide, issued a statement lodging a solemn warning to the American aggressors: "This vile behavior of the American aggressors is the most serious destruction and threat to human civilization and justice. The American aggressors must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by this inhumane atrocity. Such extremely brutal means will not only fail to intimidate the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the Korean people, but will only arouse greater hatred among the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, the Chinese and Korean people, and the righteous people of the world." The statement also stated: We, the educators of the whole country, vow to do our utmost to support our powerful Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and give these man-eating beasts – the American aggressor troops – a devastating blow.

The Beijing Committee of the China Educational Workers' Union, representing more than 25,000 educators in universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout the city, severely accuses the American aggressors of violating human justice and international law, and committing inhumane crimes, and calls on educators in Beijing to work together with the people of the whole country to further improve the work of resisting America and aiding Korea and building the motherland, and to strike the enemy more forcefully.
