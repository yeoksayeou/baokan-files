The Guangdong Provincial People's Government dismissed Zuo Hongtao from his position as Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the General Office on February 2nd. Zuo Hongtao is a Communist Party member who has participated in revolutionary struggles for over twenty years. He grew up in a family of industrialists and landlords and worked in Kuomintang areas for a long time. In the revolutionary struggle, he not only failed to resolutely eliminate the ideological consciousness of the bourgeoisie and landlord class, but stubbornly retained and allowed it to develop. Therefore, when he worked in the People's Government, he acted entirely according to bourgeois ideas and styles, resulting in the following serious errors:

	I. Blurred class stand, failure to distinguish between friend and foe, and complete loss of class stand in handling some issues. Li Leting, driver of bandit Zhang Fakui, opened a transportation company in Guangzhou after liberation. In 1950, a car of this company overturned in Conghua County, killing and injuring seven passengers, and the Conghua County People's Government impounded the car. Zuo Hongtao, because of his friendship with Li Leting, wrote a letter to the Conghua County Magistrate asking for lenient treatment. Afterwards, Li Leting gave Zuo Hongtao a large number of gifts. In the summer of 1951, a special agent fled to escape punishment. Zuo Hongtao knew about it beforehand, but because he had a period of "private friendship" with this special agent, he did not report it to his superiors and let him run away. Zuo Hongtao also introduced some people with unclear political backgrounds to work in administrative organs.

	II. Extremely serious extravagance and waste. Zuo Hongtao spent a lot of money to build dance halls and swimming pools. The construction of the General Office of the Provincial People's Government was unplanned, resulting in rework waste of up to 50 million yuan. Zuo Hongtao especially worshipped foreign goods, purchasing a large number of iron tables and chairs, electric fans, movie projectors, swimsuits, billiard balls and other supplies from Hong Kong, costing more than 1.2 billion yuan. When some cadres suggested that he save money, he said: "We are already in power now, what's the big deal with the provincial government spending a few more dollars?" He also scolded people, saying: "You still have a rural point of view." He was fond of dancing and often held dances, and the amount of waste in this area was also staggering. Each time, no matter the size of the dance party, it was very elaborate, and uneaten things were thrown around everywhere. Zuo Hongtao's personal life was also extravagant, with his expenditures exceeding the system by nearly 10 million yuan.

	III. Conniving at subordinates' violations of laws and discipline, smuggling and tax evasion. Zuo Hongtao, under the pretext of improving the lives of the organs, took 10 billion yuan from public funds and gave it to Liao Wei, the former deputy director of the Administrative Office of the General Office, to engage in "organ production." Liao evaded taxes under his instructions, causing the state to suffer a loss of more than 1.1 billion yuan. Zuo Hongtao unconditionally trusted Liao Wei's work, so that Liao Wei dared to embezzle 3.8 billion yuan of public funds and embezzle more than 100 million yuan.

	IV. Extremely shameful behavior of insulting women. He molested and insulted women more than once, fully exposing the bourgeois decadent and depraved bad style. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省人民政府副秘书长兼办公厅主任
    左洪涛敌我不分违法乱纪已被撤职
    广东省人民政府在二月二日撤销了副秘书长兼办公厅主任左洪涛的职务。左洪涛是参加革命斗争已经二十多年的共产党员。他生长在工商业者兼地主的家庭，长期在国民党地区里工作。他在革命斗争中不但没有坚决地肃清资产阶级和地主阶级的思想意识，相反地把它顽固地保留下来并让其发展。因此他在人民政府里担任工作时，完全按照资产阶级的思想和作风办事，产生了如下的严重错误：
    一、阶级立场模糊，敌我不分，对有些问题的处理完全丧失阶级立场。张匪发奎的司机李乐庭解放后在广州开设运输公司。一九五零年这个公司的汽车在从化县翻车失事，死伤搭客七人，从化县人民政府将汽车扣押。左洪涛因为和李乐庭有交情，便写信给从化县长请从宽处理。事后，李乐庭给左洪涛送了大批礼物。一九五一年夏天有一个特务分子畏罪潜逃。左洪涛事前知道，竟因和这个特务分子有过一段“私谊”，便不报告上级，让他跑了。左洪涛并曾介绍一些政治面目不清的人到行政机关工作。
    二、极其严重的铺张浪费行为。左洪涛耗费很多钱去修建舞厅、游泳池。省人民政府办公厅的修建毫无计划，以致返工浪费达五千万元。左洪涛特别崇拜外国货，从香港购入大批铁枱椅、电风扇、电影机、游泳衣、弹子球等用品，耗费了十二亿元以上。当有些干部建议他节约的时候，他竟说：“我们现在已经当权，这样大的省府多用几个钱怕什么？”又骂人说：“你们还是农村观点。”他嗜好跳舞，经常开跳舞会，在这方面的浪费数目也很惊人。每次不论开大小舞会，都很讲究，吃不完的东西随处乱丢。左洪涛个人生活也很铺张，他超过制度的支出将近一千万元。
    三、纵容下级违法乱纪、走私漏税。左洪涛藉口改善机关生活，从公款中拿出一百亿元交给前办公厅行政处副处长廖威去搞“机关生产”。廖在他的指示下进行漏税，使国家蒙受十一亿多元的损失。左洪涛对廖威的工作无条件地信任，以致廖威竟敢挪用公款三十八亿元，贪污了一亿元以上。
    四、极其可耻的污辱妇女行为。他不止一次地调戏和污辱妇女，充分暴露出资产阶级的荒淫堕落的恶劣作风。（新华社）
