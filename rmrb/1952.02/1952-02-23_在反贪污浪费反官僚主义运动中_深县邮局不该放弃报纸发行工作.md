    In the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign,
    Shen County Post Office Should Not Abandon Newspaper Distribution Work
    Editor: A certain unit subscribed to five copies of the People's Daily at the Wangjiajing Post Office in Shen County, Hebei Province, on January 14th, with an order specifying that the newspaper should be delivered starting from January 21st. However, the newspaper had not been seen by January 31st. After investigation, the Wangjiajing Post Office replied: "We have submitted the newspaper subscription notice to the Shen County Post Office, but they did not report it upwards because they were engaged in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. It has now been decided to notify them to send someone to retrieve the payment." I believe that it is wrong for the Shen County Post Office to disregard newspaper distribution work because of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, people in various regions urgently need the People's Daily to guide and promote the movement. Therefore, in addition to doing a good job in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle within their own units, post offices in various regions should work harder to promote the distribution of the People's Daily. The practice of the Shen County Post Office is completely wrong. I hope the postal bureau leadership will quickly inspect and correct this. Jin Ni

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中
    深县邮局不该放弃报纸发行工作
    编辑同志：某部于一月十四日在河北省深县王家井邮局订了五份人民日报，订单上写明自一月二十一日开始发报。可是到了一月三十一日还没有见到报纸。经过追查，据王家井邮局答覆：“我们已把订报通知单交到深县邮局，他们因为搞反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，没有向上报。现在已决定通知他们派人将款取回。”我认为深县邮局因为进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，就不顾报纸发行工作，是不对的。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，各地人民都迫切要求人民日报来指导与推动运动，因此，各地邮局除了应做好本单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争之外，应该更努力地开展人民日报的发行工作。像深县邮局这种作法，是完全错误的。希望邮局领导机关迅速检查纠正。  金尼
