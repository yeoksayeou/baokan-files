    Bravely and Resolutely Fight Against Illegal Businessmen
    Liu Ningyi
    In the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, shop employees in various regions have demonstrated great enthusiasm, courage, resourcefulness, and determination. This fully demonstrates the enhanced political awareness, sense of responsibility as masters of the country, and revolutionary fighting spirit of shop employees since liberation.
    The movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft and embezzlement of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence in private shops is a face-to-face class struggle between shop employees and illegal businessmen. The most important content of this class struggle is:
    First, to oppose the particularly strong bourgeois ideas among illegal businessmen, such as exploiting the masses, living without labor, harming others for personal gain, being driven solely by profit, engaging in favoritism, speculation, extravagance, and pursuing hedonistic lifestyles;
    Second, to oppose the various illegal activities of businessmen, which are currently mainly manifested in the following three aspects:
    A. Using bribery of state functionaries as a means to achieve tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence;
    B. Using threats (shop dismissals, etc.) and inducements (invitations, gifts, "wage increases," etc.) to suppress and obstruct shop employees from reporting and exposing their illegal activities;
    C. Using methods such as dispatching or buying off trade union cadres, organizing fake trade unions, prohibiting shop employees from joining trade unions, restricting the activities of trade union members, refusing to pay trade union dues, and undermining the unity of shop employees to achieve their goals of controlling, oppressing, and exploiting shop employees.
    Why do we regard the corrupt and degenerate ideas and various illegal activities of illegal businessmen as so serious that we must wage a resolute struggle against them? Because if these corrupt and degenerate ideas and various illegal activities are not resolutely opposed and allowed to continue to spread and develop, a large number of functionaries and cadres will inevitably be defeated and destroyed by their "sugar-coated bullets"; a larger amount of state property will inevitably be stolen and embezzled by them, causing incalculable losses to our national construction endeavors; and more institutions and organizations will inevitably be infiltrated and undermined by them. As a result, the leadership of our working class in state power will be usurped by them, and the new democratic people's democratic dictatorship cannot be consolidated and developed.
    Our purpose in resolutely fighting against illegal businessmen is to ensure that in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we will give them the necessary punishments according to the seriousness of the crimes committed by those illegal businessmen and the thoroughness of their own confessions and repentance, so that they know that the policies and laws of the People's Government will never allow them to despise and violate them, and that they will receive due and beneficial lessons from this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and in the future they will honestly and obediently conduct legal business and obtain legal profits within the scope prescribed and the path indicated by the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government. This is beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood, and also beneficial to the businessmen themselves, truly achieving "both public and private interests."
    What policies and methods should we adopt when fighting against those illegal businessmen?
    First, strengthen education. For the shop employees themselves, we must strengthen class education, so that they can distinguish class boundaries in thought and action, so that they know what are the permanent and overall interests of the working class, and what are the temporary and partial interests of the working class, so that they know that temporary and partial interests should be subordinate to permanent and overall interests. Only on the basis of such class consciousness can they withstand the threats and inducements of illegal businessmen and stand firm on the position of the working class and resolutely fight against those illegal businessmen. At the same time, we must stand in the position of the state's leading class and educate the businessmen in policies and laws, so that they know what they should do and what they should not do. For example, in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, those businessmen who have committed corruption crimes should be educated to quickly, automatically, and thoroughly confess their problems to the government, which is their only way out; if they refuse to confess and attempt to escape, then they are cutting themselves off from the people!
    Second, we must be vigilant and strictly guard against all the actions of illegal businessmen. In order to achieve their goals of making exorbitant profits, those illegal businessmen can come up with and use any despicable, shameless, and conspiratorial methods. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, in order to hide and evade their illegal crimes, they form so-called "alliances of offense and defense" and falsify or destroy accounts and receipts. However, as long as our shop employees can stand firm on the position of the working class and constantly enhance their class vigilance, pay attention to checking and supervising the words and actions of illegal businessmen, no matter how cunning and sinister the illegal businessmen are, their crimes of corruption and profiteering cannot escape the ears and eyes of our shop employees.
    Third, we must boldly report and expose the corruption crimes of illegal businessmen to the relevant organs and organizations, so that those big profiteers who refuse to confess cannot but raise their hands and surrender in the face of ironclad evidence, and we also demand that the People's Government severely punish such big corrupt businessmen who refuse to confess, in order to warn others against following their example.
    In order to enable our shop employees to quickly achieve a complete victory in the struggle against those illegal businessmen, we must pay special attention to uniting, winning over, and educating those who work in accounting, purchasing, sales, and other positions. Because these people know the most about the materials and methods of illegal businessmen's corruption, and can best grasp their "bottom line," only they can strike at the key points of illegal businessmen's corruption. Therefore, we must be able to awaken these employees and consciously stand on the side of the shop employees. After we have grasped the illegal businessmen's weaknesses, presented the solid materials, and have both human and material evidence, they will have no choice but to confess and admit it. Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai have a lot of good experience in this regard.
    Under the new democratic regime, shop employees in private shops have a dual identity. In the matter of implementing national policies and laws, we stand in the position of the state's leading class and masters of the country, and have the right and responsibility to educate, supervise, inspect, and report on private merchants; at the same time, in private shops, if their operations are completely legal, in business matters, our shop employees should still obey reasonable transfers and commands in business.
    Comrades shop employees across the country! Rise up resolutely and bravely and fight against those illegal businessmen who harm the country and the people to defend the interests of our Party, the interests of the country, and the interests of the working class. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, this struggle will surely achieve complete victory, and must achieve complete victory. At the same time, in this struggle, we must strengthen our shop employees' organization! We must consolidate the leadership of our shop employees over businessmen!

    勇敢地、坚决地和不法商人作斗争
    刘宁一
    在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的伟大斗争中，各地店员工人都表现得很积极、很勇敢、很机智、很坚定，这充分表现了在解放之后，店员工人的政治觉悟的提高，国家主人翁的责任感与工人阶级的革命斗争精神。
    私人商店中反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动，是店员工人与不法商人的面对面的阶级斗争，这种阶级斗争的内容最重要的是：
    第一就是反对在不法商人中特别浓厚的那种资产阶级的剥削群众、不劳而食、损人利己、唯利是图、假公济私、投机取巧、铺张浪费、享乐至上的腐化堕落思想；
    第二就是要反对商人的各种不法行为，他们的这些不法行为在目前主要表现在下列三个方面：
    甲、是以向国家的工作人员行贿的手段，达到他们偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报；
    乙、用威胁（商店解雇等）利诱（请客、送礼、“增加工资”等）的手段，压制阻挠店员工人对于他们那些不法行为的检举和告发；
    丙、用派遣或收买工会干部，组织假工会，禁止店员加入工会，限制工会会员的活动，拒交工会经费，破坏店员工人的团结等办法，达到他们控制、压迫、剥削店员工人的目的。
    我们为什么把不法商人的这种腐化堕落的思想与种种不法行为看得如此严重，必须与他们进行坚决的斗争呢？因为他们这种腐化、堕落思想与种种的不法行为，如果不坚决地把它反对掉而任其继续传播与发展下去，必将不断地有大批的工作人员与干部被他们那种“糖衣炮弹”所打倒、所毁灭；必将有更大量的国家资财被他们所盗窃、侵吞，使我们的国家建设事业遭受不可计算的损失；必将有更多的机关和团体被他们所渗透与破坏。因而我们工人阶级在国家政权中的领导就会被他们所篡夺，人民民主专政的新民主主义就不能巩固与发展。
    我们与不法商人坚决地进行斗争的目的，就是使我们要在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，按照那些不法商人所犯罪行的大小与他们自己坦白、悔改的彻底程度分别予以必要的惩处，使他们晓得人民政府的政策、法令，是决不允许他们轻视与违犯的，使他们从这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中得到应有的有益的教训，今后好老老实实地、规规矩矩地按照共同纲领和人民政府的政策、法令中所规定的范围与所指示的道路去进行合法的营业，获取合法的利润。这样既有益于国计民生，又利于商人自己，真正作到“公私兼顾”。
    在与那些不法商人作斗争时，我们应当采用什么样的政策与办法呢？
    一、加强教育。对于店员工人群众本身，我们要加强阶级教育，使他们在思想与行动方面，分清阶级界限，使他们知道什么是工人阶级的永久利益与整体利益，什么是工人阶级的暂时利益与局部利益，使他们晓得暂时的、局部的利益应当服从永久的和整体的利益，在这样阶级觉悟的基础上，才能经得起不法商人的威胁和利诱而站稳工人阶级的立场，坚决地和那些不法商人作斗争。同时我们还要站在国家领导阶级的地位，对于商人进行政策、法令的教育，使他们知道什么是他们应该做的，什么是他们不应该做的，譬如在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，对于那些犯了贪污罪的商人就要教育他们，迅速地、自动地、彻底地向政府坦白交代问题，这是他们的唯一出路；如果拒不坦白，企图幸免，那他们就是自绝于人民！
    二、要提高警惕，对于不法商人的一切行为，都要严加警惕。那些不法商人为了达到他们牟取暴利的目的，什么卑鄙无耻、阴谋诡计办法都可以想出，都可以使用。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他们为了隐藏、逃避他们的非法罪行，就订立什么“攻守同盟”，假造或销毁账目和单据，但是只要我们店员工人能够站稳工人阶级的立场，时时刻刻地提高自己的阶级警惕，注意检查和督促不法商人的言语与行动，无论不法商人怎样狡猾阴险，他们的贪污暴利的罪行也逃不出我们店员工人的耳目的。
    三、对于不法商人的贪污罪行，要大胆的向有关机关团体进行检举和告发，使那些拒不坦白的大奸商在铁一般的证据材料面前不能不举起手来缴械就擒，而且对于这种拒不坦白的大贪污商人，我们还要求人民政府严加惩办，以儆效尤。
    为了使我们店员工人对于那些不法商人的斗争能够迅速地取得彻底的胜利，我们要特别注意团结、争取和教育那些会计、采买、营业等人员。因为这些人对于不法商人的贪污的材料与方法知道得最多，最能摸到他们的“底细”，只有他们才能打中不法商人进行贪污的要害。因此我们要能够使这些职员觉悟起来，自觉地站到店员这一方面来。在我们抓住不法商人的小辫子，把确实的材料摆出来，有了人证物证之后，他们就非坦白承认不可。天津、北京、上海在这方面已有很多很好的经验。
    在新民主主义政权之下，私营商店中的店员是有二重身份，在执行国家政策法令等问题上，我们是站在国家领导阶级与主人翁的地位，对于私商是负有教育、督促、检查、检举之权利与责任的；同时在私营商店中如果他们的经营是完全合法的话，在业务问题上，我们店员工人还是应当服从业务上的合理的调动与指挥的。
    全国店员工人同志们！要坚决地、勇敢地起来，和那些祸国殃民的不法商人作斗争，来保卫我们党的利益、国家的利益、工人阶级的利益。这一斗争在共产党与毛主席的领导之下，一定能够获得全胜，而且必须获得全胜。同时在这一斗争中，要把我们店员工人的组织更坚强起来！把我们店员工人对于商人的领导权要巩固起来！
