    All Localities Should Emphasize Forest Protection and Fire Prevention
    Reader Letters Overview
    Recently, many readers have written to this newspaper, pointing out that many places do not pay enough attention to forest protection and fire prevention work, causing serious losses to the country's forestry undertakings.
    Reader Li Xinggu wrote that Liu Yegui, a farmer from Dongyuan Village, Xinjian Township, Wuwei County, northern Anhui, set fire to the mountain in the Houlishan area on the afternoon of October 12th last year. The burning area reached 95 mu, destroying more than 16,000 saplings in the afforestation area of ​​the Qingshan Branch of the Puji Weaving State-owned Farm, and more than 28,000 jin of mountain grass belonging to the masses in Maozhuyuan Village and other villages. The Qingshan Branch has sent Liu Yegui to Xinjian Township to be handled by the court. When Liu Yegui set fire to the mountain, some people in Dongyuan Village stood by and watched without rescuing. When Wang Xiannan, the affairs officer of the Qingshan Branch, discovered the fire, he rushed to call for help, but the people of Dongyuan Village still ignored him. Fortunately, Shi Yunxia, ​​a female representative of Maozhuyuan Village, led the masses to the rescue, and the fire did not spread further. This fact fully proves that the Dongyuan Village People's Government did not conduct forest protection and fire prevention education among the masses on weekdays.
    Reader Zhao Kerang wrote that Qiaogou Township in Song County, Henan Province, is a mountainous area. On the 13th of last month, some people went up the mountain to collect firewood and set fire to the mountain forest while burning firewood on the mountain. A militiaman from Taishanmiao Township immediately went up the mountain to catch the perpetrator and sent him to the district government for handling. However, the cadres of the Qiaogou Township government did not mobilize the masses to put out the mountain fire, causing the fire to spread for three li, burning more than 400 mu, destroying more than 20,000 oak trees, more than 5,000 small trees, and two bamboo gardens. If the masses in Qiaogou Township had rescued in time, this major loss could have been avoided. This fully shows that the cadres of this township government do not pay enough attention to forest protection and fire prevention.
    Readers Huang Maolin and Zhang Huichuan wrote that there are many pine forests in the Dasuo Gezhuang area of ​​District 1, Funing County, Hebei Province. At four o'clock in the morning on the 12th of last month, a mountain fire suddenly broke out. A farmer saw the mountain fire when he was picking up manure in the morning, and immediately ran back to the village to call for help. Wang Shengyun, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in this village, immediately organized manpower to go to the rescue. Everyone bravely extinguished the fire, which saved the pine forest. The firemen caught an arsonist on the way. According to his confession, there were five accomplices, but they all ran away. The Funing County government, upon hearing the news, has sent someone to investigate and pursue the matter. Readers unanimously request that all localities attach importance to forest protection and fire prevention work, strengthen forest protection and fire prevention education among the masses, and severely punish arsonists who destroy state forests.

    各地应重视护林防火工作
    读者来信综述
    最近有许多读者给本报写信，指出不少地方因为不重视护林防火工作，给国家的林木事业造成严重损失。
    读者李星谷来信说：皖北无为县新建乡东园村农民刘业贵，去年十月十二日下午在当地后里山一带放火烧山，燃烧面积达九十五亩，烧毁普济圩国营农场青山分场造林区的树苗一万六千多棵，和毛竹园等村群众的山草二万八千多斤。青山分场已把刘业贵送到新建乡转法院处理。在刘业贵烧山时，东园村某些群众竟坐视不救。青山分场事务长王先南发现烧山，赶去呼救，东园村群众仍置之不理。幸而毛竹园村妇女代表施云霞率领群众前去急救，火灾才不再蔓延。这一事实，充分证明了东园村人民政府平日对群众没有进行护林防火的教育。
    读者赵克让来信说：河南嵩县乔沟乡是山林地区，上月十三日有群众上山打柴，因在山上烧柴，而把山林燃着。太山庙乡一个民兵立即上山捉住肇事人，并把他送到区政府处理。但乔沟乡政府的干部没有动员群众扑救山火，致山火蔓延达三里，燃烧四百多亩，把二万多株橡子、五千多枝小树、两个竹园都烧毁了。如果乔沟乡群众及时抢救，是可以避免这个重大损失的。这充分说明这个乡政府的干部十分不注意护林防火工作。
    读者黄茂林、张汇川来信说：河北抚宁县一区大所各庄一带，松林很多。上月十二日早晨四点多钟，忽然发生山火。有一农民在早晨拾粪时，看见起了山火，马上跑回村中呼救。这村中共支部书记王胜云立即组织人力，前往抢救。大家奋不顾身地把火扑灭，才保住了松林。救火人当时在半道上捉住放火犯一名。据供，同谋者有五人，但都跑了。抚宁县政府闻讯，已派专人去调查追究。读者一致要求各地重视护林防火工作，并加强对群众的护林防火教育，严办破坏国家林木的放火犯。
