    Jinan profiteers Liu Yunsheng, An Jingyuan, etc.
    Incorporated large quantities of rotten eggs into food produced for the Volunteer Army
    Engaging in outrageous acts to harm the health of Volunteer Army comrades and reaping exorbitant profits of more than 2 billion yuan
    Liu Yunsheng, manager of the private Shengchang Egg Factory in Jinan, and An Jingyuan, the factory director, etc., in producing military food for the Volunteer Army, were utterly conscienceless, disregarding the health of the Volunteer Army comrades, and drastically cutting corners. Adding tax evasion, they stole more than 2 billion yuan from the funds of the people who supported the Volunteer Army and state taxes.
    Criminal Liu Yunsheng founded the Shengchang Egg Factory in the spring of 1950. Since its establishment, this egg factory has produced military food in large quantities. When producing egg powder, liver powder, and carrot powder, they cut corners on every item and reaped exorbitant profits. In 1950, they illegally obtained more than 540 million yuan in illicit profits. From January to July 1951, this egg factory produced 251,581.5 pounds of egg powder for the Volunteer Army. Before production, Criminal Liu purchased a large batch of eggs. Because the time was too long, some of them went bad. Criminal Liu forced the workers to mix the bad eggs into the egg products made for the Volunteer Army. According to extremely incomplete statistics, about 7,600 catties of stinky water (bad eggs) were mixed in, increasing the acidity of the egg products beyond the contract stipulations. Not satisfied with this, Criminal Liu shamelessly ordered the workers to grind carrot powder into egg yolk powder at night and mix it into the egg products. This crime was opposed by the workers at the time. The workers said, "This is egg products for resisting America and aiding Korea, we must not do this!" Criminal Liu said, "Don't worry about it, I'll take responsibility!" With this batch of egg products alone, Criminal Liu obtained more than 354 million yuan in illicit profits. In November 1951, this egg factory produced a batch of liver powder, bean powder, and carrot powder for the Volunteer Army. When producing these foods, Criminal Liu, etc., increased the moisture content. The moisture content of the liver powder was increased from 1.5% as stipulated in the contract to 2%. The moisture content of the bean powder was also increased from 4% to 9.36%. Because the moisture content of the liver powder and bean powder was increased, the acidity increased, and there were more impurities, toxins would develop after a short time, which would inevitably harm the health of the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters. Criminal Liu; gained more than 210 million yuan in illicit profits from this batch of finished products. At the same time, this egg factory also contracted with a vegetable oil factory to produce 200,830 pounds of cooked egg yolk powder for the Volunteer Army. After producing this batch of food, Criminal Liu went to their factory's Tianjin office and colluded with another profiteer to buy more than 200,000 pounds of raw yellow egg powder that could not be exported (mainly substandard) at a low price from Tianjin. After processing it into cooked egg yolk powder, they sold it to the vegetable oil factory at a high price, and gained an additional profit of more than 561 million yuan. Because the acidity of this batch of egg powder was too high, it was not suitable for consumption, and most of it was damaged.
    Criminal Liu, etc., have also consistently deceived the government, created false accounts, and underreported business income, thereby evading state taxes. It has now been found that he evaded more than 240 million yuan in income tax in 1950. In 1950 and 1951, they evaded a total of more than 480 million yuan in state taxes. In addition, Criminal Liu also trafficked in gold, illegally profiting approximately 200 million yuan.

    济南奸商刘云生、安景远等
    承制志愿军食品掺入大量臭蛋
    丧尽天良损害志愿军同志健康，从中获暴利二十多亿元
    济南私营盛昌蛋厂经理刘云生、厂长安景远等在承制志愿军军用食品中，竟丧尽天良，毫不顾及志愿军同志的身体健康，大肆偷工减料。加上偷税漏税，共盗窃祖国人民支援志愿军的款项和国家税款二十多亿元。
    刘犯云生，一九五○年春创办了盛昌蛋厂。这个蛋厂自成立时起，就大批地承制军用食品。在承制蛋粉、肝粉、胡萝?粉时，没一种不偷工减料，骗取暴利。一九五○年曾非法牟取暴利五亿四千多万元。一九五一年一月至七月，这个蛋厂承制志愿军用的二十五万一千五百八十一磅半蛋粉。承制之前，刘犯收购了大批鸡蛋。由于时间过长，有一部变坏。刘犯就强逼工人把坏蛋掺在给志愿军承制的蛋品中。据极不完整的统计，约掺进臭水（坏蛋）七千六百多斤，使蛋品中酸度增高，超过合同规定。刘犯并没有以此为满足，更无耻地命令工人在夜间碾压胡萝?粉顶蛋黄粉，掺进蛋品中去。这种罪行，当时曾遭到工人的反对。工人说：“这是抗美援朝的蛋品，决不能这样做！”刘犯却说：“你们不要管，由我负责！”只这一批蛋品，刘犯就获得暴利三亿五千四百多万元。一九五一年十一月，这个蛋厂给志愿军承制一批肝粉、豆粉、胡萝?粉等。刘犯等在承制这些食品时增加水分，肝粉的水分由合同规定的百分之一·五，增至百分之二。豆粉的水分亦由百分之四，增加至百分之九·三六。由于肝粉、豆粉中的水分加多，酸度增高，杂质又多，时间稍长，就会发生毒素，势必损害志愿军指战员的健康。刘犯在这批成品中；又获暴利二亿一千多万元。与此同时，这个蛋厂又通过植物油厂给志愿军承制熟蛋黄粉二十万零八千三百多磅。刘犯在承制这批食品后，就去他们厂的天津办事处与另一奸商勾结，从天津低价买了二十多万磅不能出口的生黄蛋粉（主要是不合标准），经加工变成熟蛋黄粉后，再高价卖给植物油厂，又从中获得暴利五亿六千一百多万元。这批蛋粉中因酸度过高，不宜食用，大部分损坏。
    刘犯等还一贯欺骗政府，造假账，少报营业额，从中偷漏国税。现已查获他在一九五○年中偷漏所得税二亿四千多万元。一九五○年、一九五一年两年中共偷漏国税四亿八千多万元。此外，刘犯又贩卖黄金，非法牟利约值二亿元。
