Good Examples of Cherishing the Motherland's Resources
Chinese People's Volunteer Army: Ma Hongji, Sheng Shusheng, Wang Tian

Not Allowing a Single Bag of Rice to be Lost

"The things I guard are all obtained through the frugal living and diligent labor of the people of the motherland, day and night. If we lose a bag of rice, it is equivalent to increasing the burden on the people of the motherland, and it means that the comrades at the front lines will have to fight the enemy on an empty stomach. How can that be allowed? Even if I die, I must protect these supplies." This is what Gao Qizhen, a Volunteer Army soldier and Communist Party member guarding a warehouse in Korea, said. He proved his promise with his heroic actions.

On June 10, 1951, enemy aircraft bombed the warehouse guarded by Gao Qizhen. A camouflaged cannon nearby was set on fire by an incendiary bomb. After Gao Qizhen discovered this, he immediately jumped out of the air-raid shelter and, regardless of the enemy's strafing, ran towards the fire. There was no water there, so Gao Qizhen took off his clothes and used them to beat out the fire on the cannon. Finally, he put out the fire with sand. However, the warehouse caught fire again. He rushed back to the warehouse to rescue the supplies. He carried out more than twenty bags of rice, each weighing over two hundred pounds, in one breath. Overwhelmed by fatigue and the heat and smoke of the fire, Gao Qizhen fainted. Later, when other comrades came to rescue the supplies, Gao Qizhen woke up. Seeing that the supplies in the warehouse had not been completely rescued, he endured the excruciating pain of burns all over his body, gritted his teeth, and continued to rescue them. He didn't collapse again until more than ten thousand pounds of rice had been rescued.

Rescuing the Truck from the Fire

On the night of April 12, 1951, Zhang Tingqiu was driving a truck loaded with anti-tank grenades forward. As he was driving, five flares suddenly lit up overhead. Several trucks traveling with him wanted to rush forward, but the road ahead was too narrow to pass, blocking the way. At this moment, enemy aircraft began a frantic strafing run. Some drivers ran to take cover, but Zhang Tingqiu lay in a small ditch by the side of the road, monitoring the enemy aircraft. Suddenly, three trucks on the road were hit, and the fuel tank of the truck driven by Zhang Tingqiu exploded. Looking at these ammunition boxes about to explode, he was extremely anxious. He made up his mind and said, "I would rather sacrifice myself than stand idly by and watch the trucks burn!" He took off his coat and quickly put out the fire on the truck, and then used dirt to extinguish the fire on the dashboard. Then, he quickly jumped into the driver's seat, turned on the ignition, and with a "whoosh," drove the truck out of the fire. Afterwards, he came back to try to drive out the burning large "Dodge" truck, but he didn't have the ignition key, and the truck wouldn't start. In an emergency, he went back and backed up the truck he had already driven out, and towed the large "Dodge" truck out. Several other comrades also came to help rescue at this time. Zhang Tingqiu led them, braving the enemy's strafing, and rescued all the unburned vehicles from the flames and rain of bullets.

"Platoon Leader, Let Me Carry the Time Bomb Away!"

Enemy aircraft dropped two time bombs at the intersection of a railway and a highway in Korea, on the afternoon of May 16, 1951. The time bombs were only four or five meters away from a train. If they exploded, all the supplies in the fourteen cars would be destroyed. When Comrade Wu Baoyu learned of this, he volunteered to request the platoon leader:

"Platoon Leader, let me carry the time bombs away!" The platoon leader agreed and told him to be very careful. Wu Baoyu went excitedly, and carried the two time bombs to a place two hundred meters away. In less than an hour, both bombs exploded. However, the railway, highway, vehicles, and supplies did not suffer any damage.

    爱护祖国物资的好榜样
    中国人民志愿军  马鸿基、盛潄生、王田
    不让一包米受损失
    “我所看守的这些东西，都是祖国人民节衣缩食，日夜勤劳所换来的。我们要是损失一包米，就等于给祖国人民增加许多劳累，就是要让前方的同志们饿着肚子去杀敌人。那怎么能行呢？我就是死了，也得保住这些物资的。”这是警戒朝鲜某地仓库的志愿军战士、共产党员高启振说的话。他用英勇的行为，证实了自己的诺言。
    一九五一年六月十日，敌人的飞机轰炸高启振所警戒的仓库。附近一门覆有伪装的大炮被汽油弹烧着了。高启振发现以后，马上跳出防空洞，不管敌机的扫射，向着着火的地方奔去。那里没有水，高启振就把衣服脱下来扑打炮身上的火。最后用沙土把火扑灭了。可是，仓库又着火了。他又急忙跑回仓库去抢救东西。二百多斤重一袋的大米，他一口气背出了二十多袋。过度的疲劳和火烤烟熏，高启振昏倒了。后来等其他同志赶来抢救物资时，高启振苏醒过来了。他看到仓库里的物资还没有抢救完，就熬着全身火伤的剧痛，咬着牙又去抢救。直到把一万多斤大米都抢救出来以后，他又累倒了。
    从火堆里把车子抢救出来
    一九五一年四月十二日夜，张廷球驾着一台装满了反坦克手雷的汽车向前行驶。正行间，头顶上突然亮着五颗照明弹。和他同行的几台车子本想冲过去，可是前面因为路窄错不过车，堵住了去路。就在这时候，敌机开始了疯狂的扫射，有的驾驶员跑去躲避了，张廷球就伏在公路边的小沟里监视着敌机。忽然路上的三辆车子被打着了，张廷球所驾的那台车的油桶爆炸。他看着这些将要爆炸的弹药箱，心里焦急万分，他下定决心说：“宁愿牺牲自己，也决不能白瞪着眼看着车子被烧毁！”他脱下大衣，迅速扑灭了车上的火，又用泥土把驾驶台上的火盖熄，然后急速地跳上驾驶台，拉开电门，“呼”一声，把车子开出火堆。随后他又回来想把那辆将要燃烧的大“道奇”车开出来，可是没有开电门的钥匙，车子不能发动。在紧急的情况下，他又回去把已经开出去的车子倒回来，把大“道奇”车拖了出去。另外几个同志这时也来抢救了，张廷球带领着他们，冒着敌机的扫射，从烈火和弹雨里把没有烧着的汽车全部救出来了。
    “连长，让我把定时炸弹扛开去！”
    敌机在朝鲜某地铁路和公路的交叉点上，投下了两枚定时炸弹，那是一九五一年五月十六日下午。定时炸弹距离一列火车只有四、五米远，如果爆炸了，这十四个车厢里的物资就要全部完了。这事让吴宝馀同志知道了，他就自动地向连长请求说：
    “连长，让我把定时炸弹扛开去！”连长答应了，并且嘱咐他千万要小心。吴宝余兴奋地去了，他把两枚定时炸弹扛到二百米以外的地方。没过一个钟头，两枚炸弹都爆炸了。可是铁路、公路、车辆、物资都没有遭受丝毫损失。
