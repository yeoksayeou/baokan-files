The treacherous merchant Wang Zhanheng Frantically Attacks State Organs, Colluding with Corrupt Elements to Steal State Assets Worth 3.45 Billion Yuan from the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Bureau Warehouse

Wang Zhanheng is the Standing Supervisor of the "Living Metal Manufacturing Industry Association" in Shenyang. His Hongda Nail Factory has more than ten machines, and at its peak, it had fifty to sixty workers. Before the liberation of Shenyang, he was just a vagrant with nothing, relying solely on the remnants of the enemy and puppet regime to survive. When the sound of artillery liberating Shenyang rang out, his masters and sworn brothers fled or hid, but he stirred up muddy waters, stealing some of the enemy and puppet materials that should have been taken over by the state. He wanted to open a factory but lacked cash. In the winter of 1948, he fraudulently purchased sixty jars of hydrochloric acid from the Tiexi District State-owned Chemical Factory at a low price of 600,000 Northeast Yuan per jar. He then resold it to the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, another state-owned enterprise, at a high price (1 million Northeast Yuan), making a huge profit of 24 million Northeast Yuan. Thus, the Hongda Nail Factory started operations.

Without problems, he would not have a single trace of national concept in his mind, nor the slightest intention of serving the national economy and the people's livelihood. He was busy all day long between the relevant state-owned enterprises and state organs. He never stopped planning to steal the assets of the state and the people. He evaded taxes as much as possible. Of course, these things were not allowed by state organs. In the autumn of 1949, the tax authorities sent people to check his accounts. He even lied to the staff of the tax authorities: "I am an old cadre, I am a member of the Eighth Route Army, look at my 'Veteran's Badge'!"

By 1950, Wang Zhanheng launched a frantic attack on state organs.

The first time he went to the Post and Telecommunications Bureau warehouse to pick up materials, he used the excuse of "borrowing fire" to distribute high-quality cigarettes to the warehouse staff and got acquainted with the warehouse director. The second time, he invited the warehouse director to a restaurant, patted him on the shoulder and asked "intimately": "Old brother, are you married? Do you want women?" Then, twill uniforms and woolen uniforms were also made for the warehouse director and sent to him. Hundreds of thousands of Northeast Yuan, "Whenever you need to spend, brother will send it." When the sister of a warehouse clerk got married, Wang Zhanheng took care of all the banquets. In August 1950, he gave the weigher Sun Yongfu 30 million Northeast Yuan at once. Later, everyone became more and more "friendly." The father of purchasing agent An Shiying lived in the Hongda Nail Factory; the son of warehouse clerk Yang and the relatives of warehouse clerk Ma were apprentices in this nail factory. All the warehouse staff became Wang Zhanheng's "good friends." This huge state warehouse became Wang Zhanheng's "home." He could drive ten or twenty rubber-wheeled carts into the warehouse yard at will to haul things; he himself could take six or seven workers deep into the warehouse to select the materials he needed; the weigher did not need to weigh the materials he took, and even when weighing, it was very casual. Moreover, according to Wang Zhanheng's own confession, the weigher always gave him an extra ton and a half of iron wire each time. After the in-depth anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau found out that once Wang Zhanheng pulled away eighteen carts of materials, neither knowing what materials they were nor what they were used for. No wonder the workers of the Hongda Nail Factory said: "Manager Wang (referring to Wang Zhanheng) really has a way, things that others can't buy, he pulls home cart after cart!"

Now, according to Wang Zhanheng's confession and the materials already discovered within the agency, a preliminary, conservative calculation shows that in the process of processing and ordering goods for the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Wang Zhanheng used despicable methods such as theft, cutting corners, and exchanging old for new to defraud the state of a huge amount of 3,455,566,000 Yuan. Here we only give the following two examples.

In 1951, the Hongda Nail Factory processed and manufactured forty-two tons of nails for the Post and Telecommunications Bureau. The contract stipulated that fifty-one tons of old iron wire would offset the processing fee, and forty-two tons of old iron wire would be used as the material cost. That is to say, the state exchanged forty-two tons of nails for ninety-three tons of old iron wire. Because the Post and Telecommunications Bureau warehouse became Wang Zhanheng's "home," capitalists could arbitrarily choose when they went to pull materials. According to the materials reported by Li Yueru, the former chairman of the Hongda Nail Factory's trade union, at least one-third of the ninety-three tons of so-called "old iron wire" was copper wire (the price of which is about nine times higher than that of iron wire), as well as valuable motor rope, etc.; as for the iron wire used as a cover, most of it was also eighty percent new.

The second example also occurred in 1951. Wang Zhanheng received thirty tons of new iron wire from the Clothing Bureau for processing. He picked out twenty tons of it and exchanged it for thirty tons of so-called "old iron wire" from the Post and Telecommunications Bureau warehouse. Using state materials to exchange for state materials, he stole ten tons of new iron wire in one turn. As for the nails processed for the Clothing Bureau, according to the workers of the factory, most of the materials were the remnants of broken iron wire from the Hongda Nail Factory, and most of the new iron wire given to him by the state was stolen and sold to his colleagues. That is to say, those forty tons of iron wire were almost entirely "earned" by him. As for the losses caused by cutting corners and exchanging inferior goods for good ones, it is impossible to calculate.

In December 1950, Wang Zhanheng had canvassed an order for 60,000 catties of "running nails" from the Clothing Bureau, but his factory had no equipment for making "running nails" at all.

He defrauded the state of more than 30,000 catties of raw materials and 150 million Yuan in order fees. He stole and sold 10,000 catties of raw materials; and used 150 million Yuan of order fees for speculation. Half a year later, he said that he could not complete the task of "running nails," sent a small portion of finished products, and returned a small portion of raw materials and 150 million Yuan in order fees. The state suffered incalculable losses, but his capital became more and more abundant. Why could the Clothing Bureau tolerate his illegal behavior? Because he had bribed relevant personnel with ginseng, gold nuggets, money, etc., which became a stepping stone for him to get rich.

He also used a series of insidious and despicable methods to evade taxes, the most effective of which was still bribery. In 1950, he supplied the tax bureau's resident staff member Liang Yongqi with milk and fruit every day; one day, he and his wife got Liang Yongqi drunk with wine and stuffed five million Yuan into Liang's pocket. From then on, Liang Yongqi became his man. He used this despicable method to evade a large amount of state taxes; according to his own accounts, the income tax he stole was 441,160,000 Yuan.

His biggest customers are not only in Shenyang; he has also done business in Anshan, Benxi, Fushun and other places; the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau is also one of his old customers. The theft cases he committed in these places are not included in the materials collected in this article.

Calculated only on the basis of the 3,455,566,000 Yuan he stole through the Post and Telecommunications Bureau warehouse, it can purchase more than 5,000 tons of grain. The working class is working hard to increase production and save money on the production front, and the people of the whole country are wholeheartedly resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but he is stealing state property wantonly in the back; making a fortune from the blood and sweat of the people! This time the government called on capitalists with sins to confess their mistakes frankly. On the surface, he pretended to be active, but behind his back he threatened those who accepted bribes, "Even if the knife is pressed against your neck, you can't say it!" He also wants to continue to steal, and also wants to drag the New Democratic Society into a capitalist society. He is dreaming! The people will surely punish criminals like him! (Wang Ping)

    奸商王占恒向国家机关猖狂进攻  
    勾结贪污分子从东北邮电总局仓库  
    盗窃国家资财价值三十四亿五千多万元
    王占恒是沈阳市“生活用金属制造业同业公会”的常务监事。他所开的鸿大制钉厂有十多台机器，工人最多时到五六十人。在沈阳解放前，他只是一个一无所有、专靠敌伪残余势力过活的流氓。解放沈阳的炮声一响，他的师父、干哥……逃的逃、躲的躲；他却混水摸鱼，盗窃了一部分应归国家接收的敌伪物资。他想开工厂，但缺现金。他便在一九四八年冬，以六十万元东北币一坛的低价，向铁西区国营化工厂骗买了六十坛盐酸；转手就以高价（一百万元东北币）卖给另一国营企业的邮电局，获暴利二千四百万元（东北币）。这样，鸿大制钉厂便开工了。
    没有问题，他脑子里不会有一丝一毫的国家观念，也没有一点为国计民生服务的打算。他成天在有关的国营企业和国家机关之间奔忙。他一刻也不停止地打算盗窃国家人民的资财。他尽可能地偷税漏税。这些事情当然是为国家机关所不容许的。一九四九年秋，税务机关便派人去查他的账。他竟冲着税务机关的工作人员扯谎：“我是老干部，我是八路军，你看我的‘荣军牌’！”
    到了一九五○年，王占恒对国家机关展开了猖狂的进攻。
    他头一次去邮电总局仓库取料时，便用“借火”为名，向这个仓库的工作人员普遍地散发了一次上等香烟，并且结识了仓库主任。第二次便请仓库主任下馆子，拍着他的肩“亲切”地问：“老弟，结婚没有？想娘儿们吗？”接着，斜纹布制服、呢制服也给仓库主任做好了送去。上百万元的东北币，“要花时哥哥就送来”。有一个仓库库员的妹妹出嫁，全部酒席都是王占恒办理的。一九五○年八月，他一次就给过秤员孙永福三千万元的东北币。以后，大家越来越有“交情”了，采购员安世英的父亲住在鸿大制钉厂；杨库员的儿子和马库员的亲戚都在这个制钉厂当学徒。仓库的全体人员都成了王占恒的“好朋友”。这个巨大的国家仓库，也就成了王占恒的“家”。他可以套十辆或二十辆胶皮大车随便进入仓库的院内拉东西；他本人更可以带着六七个小工深入仓库内部去挑选他需要的材料；过秤员对他取的材料可以不必过秤，即使过秤时也是随随便便的。而且，据王占恒自己供称，过秤员每次总是额外送他一吨半的铁线。最近反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动深入后，邮电总局查出有一次王占恒拉走了十八大车材料，既不知是什么材料，也不知是干什么用的。无怪乎鸿大制钉厂的工人们说：“王经理（指王占恒）真有办法，别人买也买不着的东西，他一车一车往家里拉！”
    现在，根据王占恒的自供和机关内部所已发现的材料，作初步的、只低不高的计算，王占恒在邮电总局加工定货的过程中，就用盗窃和偷工减料、以旧换新等卑鄙无耻的办法，骗取了国家三十四亿五千五百六十六万元的巨额资财。在这里我们只举出下面两个例子。
    一九五一年，鸿大制钉厂为邮电总局加工制造钉子四十二吨，合同上订明以五十一吨旧铁丝顶加工费，四十二吨旧铁丝为材料费。就是说，国家以九十三吨旧铁丝换四十二吨钉子。由于邮电总局仓库成了王占恒的“家”，资本家去拉材料时便可任意挑选。根据鸿大制钉厂前任工会主席李月如检举的材料来看，在九十三吨所谓“旧铁丝”中，至少有三分之一的铜线（价格比铁丝约高九倍），还有贵重的马机绳等；至于作为掩护物之用的铁丝，也大多数是八成新的。
    第二个例子也是一九五一年发生的。王占恒为被服局加工，从被服局领得了新铁丝三十吨。他把其中的二十吨挑出来去向邮电总局仓库换了三十吨所谓“旧铁丝”。用国家的材料换国家的材料，一转手就盗窃了国家十吨新铁丝。而为被服局加工的钉子，据该厂工人反映，绝大部分的材料是鸿大制钉厂残存的破烂铁丝，国家给他的新铁丝大半被他盗卖给他的同业了。这就是说，那四十吨铁丝几乎全部被他“赚”去了。至于因偷工减料、以坏换好所造成的损失，那更是无法计算的。
    在一九五○年十二月，王占恒曾经兜揽了被服局的六万斤“跑钉”的定货，而他厂里根本没有制“跑钉”的设备。
    他骗取了国家三万多斤原料，骗取了一亿五千万元的定货费。他盗卖了一万斤原料；并把一亿五千万元的定货费大肆投机倒把。半年以后，他说他不能完成“跑钉”的任务，送上了一小部分成品，退还了一小部分原料和一亿五千万元的定货费。国家吃了无可计算的亏，他的资本却越来越雄厚。为甚么被服局能容忍他的这种非法行为？因为他曾用人参、金镏子、钱等等向有关人员大行其贿，成为他发财的垫脚石。
    他在偷税漏税方面，也用了一系列阴险卑鄙的方法，其中最有效的方法仍然是行贿。一九五○年，他天天用牛奶、水果供给税务局驻厂员梁永启；有一天他和他的老婆一同把梁永启用酒灌醉，往梁的衣袋里塞了五百万元，从此，梁永启便成了他的人了。他就用这种卑鄙手段，偷漏了大批国税；仅据他自己的账目所查出的，所偷所得税就有四亿四千一百一十六万元。
    他最大的主顾还不仅在沈阳；鞍山、本溪、抚顺等地他都去做过买卖；沈阳市的电工局，也是他的老主顾之一。他在这些地方所做的盗窃事件，根本没有包括在本文所搜集的材料中。
    仅据他通过邮电总局仓库所偷盗的三十四亿五千五百六十六万元来计算，就可以购买粮食五千吨以上。工人阶级在生产战线上努力增产节约，全国人民都在全心全意地抗美援朝，他却在背后大肆盗窃国家财产；大发人民的血汗财！这次政府号召有罪恶的资本家们坦白认错，他表面上假装积极，背地里威胁受贿的人，“刀按在脖子上也不能说！”他还想继续盗窃，还想把新民主主义社会拉到资本主义社会。他是在做梦！人民必定要惩罚像他这样的罪犯！  （王坪）
