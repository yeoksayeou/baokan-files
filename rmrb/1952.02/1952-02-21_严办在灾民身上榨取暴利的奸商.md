    Severely Punish 奸商 Profiteering from Disaster Victims

    According to the Henan Daily, the奸商 Chen Jie, who was engaged in gypsum business in Shan County, Henan, colluded with Di Junmin, a secretary of the Shan County People's Government and a corrupt element. Taking advantage of the disaster in Shan County, he suppressed prices and forced the purchase of gypsum produced by disaster victims. Chen's crimes are heinous and he has been arrested by the People's Government. In the winter of 1950, Chen Jie used the low price of 110 yuan to forcibly purchase 800,000 jin of gypsum produced by disaster victims. Di Junmin abused his power to prevent Beijing businessmen from purchasing gypsum at a price of 140 yuan per jin, and forced the disaster victims to sell the gypsum to Chen Jie. In the spring of 1951, Chen Jie again used the same despicable means to forcibly purchase 800,000 jin of gypsum from disaster victims at a price of 140 yuan per jin; while the price of gypsum purchased by the Shan County Cooperative at that time was 280 yuan per jin, which was twice as high as the price offered by Chen. In these two transactions alone, Chen Jie obtained a huge profit of 200 million yuan from the disaster victims, which could feed 5,000 disaster victims for a month.

    There is an old saying in our country, "Relief is like fighting a fire." The People's Government, in the face of considerable financial difficulties, allocated huge sums of money to help disaster victims and lead them in production to overcome the famine; the people of the whole country, with infinite sympathy and concern, supported their disaster-stricken brothers. However, the 奸商 who harm others to benefit themselves and are only interested in profit, regardless of the life and death of the disaster victims, forcibly seize the fruits of production on which the disaster victims depend for their survival. They are so cruelly and mercilessly squeezing the fat of the disaster victims to fatten themselves. Is this something that every Chinese with human sympathy can tolerate? The disaster victims who have been exploited by the 奸商 Chen Jie all have the right to recover this grievance; we accuse these conscienceless 奸商 and demand that the People's Government severely punish these 奸商.

    严办在灾民身上榨取暴利的奸商
    据河南日报载：河南陕县经营石膏生意的奸商陈杰，勾引陕县人民政府秘书、贪污分子狄俊民，乘陕县人民灾荒之危，压价强购灾民生产的石膏。陈犯罪大恶极，已被人民政府逮捕。一九五零年冬，陈杰用一百一十元的低价，强购灾民生产的石膏八十万斤。狄俊民滥用职权，阻止北京商人用一百四十元一斤的价格收购石膏，并强迫灾民把石膏卖给陈杰。一九五一年春，陈杰又用同样卑鄙的手段，以一百四十元一斤的价格，强购灾民的石膏八十万斤；而当时陕县合作社收购石膏的价格是每斤二百八十元，较陈犯所出价格高一倍。仅这两宗交易，陈杰就从灾民身上取得暴利两亿元，可供五千灾民吃一个月。
    我国有一句古话，叫作“救灾如救火”。人民政府在财政相当困难的情况下，拨出巨款，救济灾民，领导灾民生产度荒；全国人民以无限的同情和关怀，支援灾民弟兄。但是，损人利己、唯利是图的奸商，却不顾灾民死活，强夺灾民赖以活命的生产果实，他们竟是这样残酷地、忍心地榨取灾民的脂膏，喂肥了自己。这是每一个有人类同情心的中国人所能容忍的吗？曾受奸商陈杰压榨的灾民，谁都有权利讨还这笔冤债；我们控诉这些狼心狗肺的奸商，要求人民政府严办这些奸商。
