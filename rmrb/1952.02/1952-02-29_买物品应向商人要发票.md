    Should Ask Merchants for Invoices When Buying Goods

    Editor: Many students in our school have criticized and confessed their mistakes in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. However, everyone truly doesn't understand the role of asking shops for invoices when buying things. For example, Ma Xiuran from class 30 bought things several times in Tianjin and didn't get invoices. He said that asking for invoices was useless. The merchant told him, "Go ahead, we'll tear up the invoices after we issue them anyway." Because many people don't understand the significance of issuing invoices, they unknowingly encourage merchants to evade taxes, causing great losses to the people. I hope everyone will ask merchants for invoices when buying things, as this is an act of patriotism.

    买物品应向商人要发票
    编辑同志：我校许多同学在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，批判和坦白了自己的错误。但大家对买东西时要商店开发票的作用，确实不懂。如三十班同学马秀然，曾在天津买几次东西，都没开发票，他说，要发票没用处。商人对他说：“你走吧，我们开了发票撕了就是。”正因为许多人不了解开发票的意义，就无形中助长了商人偷税漏税的行为，使人民遭受了很大损失。希望大家买东西时，向商人要发票，这是爱国的行为。
