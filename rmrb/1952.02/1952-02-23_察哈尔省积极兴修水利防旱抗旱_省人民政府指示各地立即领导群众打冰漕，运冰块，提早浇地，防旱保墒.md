Chahar Province, after suffering from widespread and severe drought last year, deeply realized that developing farmland water conservancy is the primary condition for ensuring agricultural abundance. After last autumn, the Chahar Provincial People's Government determined that this year's water conservancy work policy is to develop mass-based water conservancy work, and put forward the slogan of requiring the entire province to increase half a mu of irrigated land per person on average. The Provincial People's Government, through joint meetings of commissioners and local party committees, labor model conferences, people's representative conferences, and water conservancy representative conferences, implemented this policy and formulated specific water conservancy work plans based on the actual conditions of various regions. This plan requires the province to utilize all water sources (surface water and groundwater) and adopt various methods to expand the irrigated area by 1.7 million mu, ensuring an increase in grain production of 100 million jin from the expansion of irrigated land. In addition, it was decided to build a large number of gully dams to strengthen soil and water conservation, and to pay attention to the construction of flood control projects in areas along rivers that are vulnerable to flooding, in order to prevent water damage.

From last autumn to January this year, all parts of the province actively led the masses in carrying out various water conservancy works. The province completed more than 600,000 mu of autumn and winter irrigation; and stored water and nurtured ice through various methods. The ice stored by farmers under the leadership of labor model Li Hewang in Yanghe River, Huai'an County, and the ice stored by farmers in the Sidaosha River, Wanquan County, can irrigate about 35,000 mu of land this spring. Farmers in some areas of northern Chahar have already begun to transport ice blocks to the fields to prepare for preserving soil moisture. Currently, many canals have begun to cut ice channels for irrigation. Well-digging work has not stopped from last autumn to now. At present, the three special districts of southern Chahar, northern Chahar, and northern Yan have completed digging more than 6,500 wells, and more than 6,600 are under construction. Waterwheel manufacturing is being vigorously carried out, and more than 2,450 waterwheels have been pre-loaned to various places. 114 canals have been repaired in various places, which can irrigate more than 52,000 mu of land.

At present, due to the scarcity of rain and snow last winter and this spring in Chahar Province, the Provincial People's Government has urgently instructed the commissioners and county heads of all special districts to strengthen drought prevention and drought resistance work, and to launch a mass-based drought prevention and drought resistance movement. It also instructed that the following two tasks be carried out immediately: First, it is necessary to quickly mobilize the masses to cut ice channels, build ice dams, draw water early, irrigate day and night, and pay attention to sending people to guard the canals, prevent ice blocks from blocking the canals, control the irrigation depth, save water, and expand the irrigation area. Second, in areas along rivers and other areas with water sources, it is necessary to vigorously organize people and animals to transport ice to the land, and pay attention to keeping the ice transportation distance short, and the area of ice-covered land concentrated; if it is not concentrated, it will lose its moisture-preserving effect.

    察哈尔省积极兴修水利防旱抗旱
    省人民政府指示各地立即领导群众打冰漕，运冰块，提早浇地，防旱保墒
    察哈尔省在去年遭受了普遍严重的旱灾以后，深刻地体会到发展农田水利是保证农业丰产的首要条件。去年秋后，察哈尔省人民政府就确定今年的水利工作方针是发展群众性的水利工作，提出了要求全省平均每人增加半亩水地的口号。省人民政府通过专员和中共地委的联席会议，劳动模范会议，人民代表会议，和水利代表会议，贯彻了这一方针，并根据各地区的实际情况作出了具体的水利工作计划。这个计划要求全省利用一切水源（地上水和地下水），采取各种方式扩大水地面积一百七十万亩，保证全省从扩大水地面积方面增产粮食一亿斤。此外并决定大量修建谷坊，加强水土保持工作，在沿河流容易受水灾威胁的地区注意修防洪工程，防止水害。
    从去年秋天开始，到今年一月止，全省各地就积极领导群众，进行了各项水利工作。全省秋冬浇地共达六十多万亩；并用各种办法蓄水养冰，只怀安县劳动模范李河旺领导农民在洋河蓄存的冰和万全县农民在四道沙河蓄存的冰，今春就可浇地三万五千亩左右。察北有的地区的农民已开始把冰块运到地里准备保墒。现在不少渠道已开始打冰漕浇地。打井工作从去年秋天到现在一直没有停顿。现在察南、察北、雁北三个专区已完成打井六千五百多眼，正在动工的有六千六百多眼。水车制造正在大力进行，各地预贷水车已有二千四百五十多部。各地已修好的渠道有一百一十四道，可浇地五万二千多亩。
    目前察哈尔省因为去冬今春雨雪稀少，省人民政府已紧急指示各专区专员、县长加强防旱抗旱工作，展开群众性的防旱抗旱运动。并指示要立即进行下面两件工作：第一、要迅速发动群众打冰漕、垒冰堰，提早引水，昼夜浇地，并要注意派人看管渠道，防止冰块堵塞渠道，掌握浇地深度，节省水量，扩大浇地面积。第二、沿河道等有水源地区，要大力组织人畜，运冰上地，并要注意运冰距离要近，上冰地的面积要集中；如果不集中就会失去保墒作用。（文彬）
