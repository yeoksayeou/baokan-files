Beijing Sixth District Pharmaceutical Store Employees' Reading Group
Exposes the Crime of Capitalists Selling Fake Medicines to Obtain Huge Profits

To the Editor: On February 4th, the Sixth District Pharmaceutical Workers' Union of Beijing held a joint meeting of reading group leaders from pharmaceutical stores to study the role of reading groups in the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion movement in the industrial and commercial sectors.

More than 30 group leaders attended (representing 500 reading group members in the district), and almost all of them spoke. They unanimously believed that the reading groups played a role in encouraging everyone to fight against the illegal activities of capitalists. Yao Disheng, a member of the reading group at Qu Chen Shi Pharmacy, was originally a relative of the pharmacy's manager, Ma Jiyong. Ma Jiyong often gave him small favors and secretly increased his salary without telling others, trying to induce him to engage in illegal activities such as giving kickbacks to buyers, evading taxes, and withdrawing capital. At the beginning of the movement, Yao Disheng's thinking was conflicted. However, after continuous reading and learning, and with the persuasion and education of union comrades, he finally exposed Ma Jiyong's illegal behavior.

At the meeting, the reading group leaders exposed the capitalists' criminal acts of selling fake medicines to obtain huge profits. For example, the "Pearl Babao Boyun Powder" sold by Liang Guangming Eye Medicine Store did not contain the necessary fine medicinal materials (such as bear bile) at all. Cow-bezoar should have been one of the main ingredients, but in the 14,000 bottles of eye medicine sold last year, less than one tael of cow-bezoar was added. The quality of the medicine was exactly the same, but it was sold at five prices: 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000. Although the workers repeatedly raised this issue, the capitalists shamelessly said: "If the price is low, the medicine will not have prestige." When the anti-fraud and anti-profiteering struggle began, the capitalists even threatened the workers, saying: "Whether we lose money in the future depends on you." In 1949, Tong De Tang bought dog kidneys for 500 yuan, but in 1950, they sold the dog kidneys as sea dog kidneys for 30,000 yuan each; the same Niuhuang Qingxin Pills were sold at three prices: 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 yuan, simply because the markings on the wax skins were different; the Niuhuang Shangqing Pills did not contain any cow-bezoar at all; and the Lingyang Jiedu Pills did not contain any antelope horn or rhinoceros horn at all. The eye medicine sold by Heng Ji Tang was claimed to contain Sichuan calamine, but in reality, it contained calamine powder, mung bean flour, and cooked gypsum (gypsum is heaty and will burn the eyes), while the cow-bezoar, pearl, and musk that should have been added were not added at all. The Sanshen Powder, deer kidneys, and sea dog kidneys sold by Tong Ji Tang were all fake; the cost of wild ginseng was 800,000 yuan per catty, but the selling price reached 4 million yuan, obtaining huge profits. De Shou Tang sold white ginseng as American ginseng, selling it for 1.6 million yuan per catty, while the cost was only 300,000 yuan per catty. In terms of Western medicine, some pharmacies sold ordinary cod liver oil as cod liver oil concentrate, making a profit of seven times; they bought empty penicillin bottles and filled them with fake penicillin; they used sugar syrup to replace glycerin; they used peanut oil to replace olive oil, and so on (The pharmaceutical workers' union should mobilize the vast number of pharmaceutical store employees to continue to expose the criminal behavior of pharmaceutical capitalists in seeking exorbitant profits and disregarding the lives and health of the people, and submit them to the government for legal action - Editor).

According to the reports from the reading group leaders, many pharmacies have problems. Da Ren Tang Pharmacy, which has branches all over the country and a history of hundreds of years, actually sold a kind of Gubengao, using eight different medicine names, and marked various selling prices to obtain huge profits. Xiang Gengting, the reading group leader of the store, said: "I have known about this unreasonable thing since I started working here as a child. This kind of fraud and profiteering must be thoroughly cleaned up in this movement." The meeting decided: (1) In the future, the reading groups should carry out better learning, and improve the political consciousness of the store employees through reading newspapers, and continue to mobilize everyone to expose the criminal behavior of the capitalists in this movement; (2) Universally promote the experience of the pharmaceutical knowledge learning group established by the employees of De Shou Tang, in order to supervise the illegal behavior of capitalists selling fake medicines. (3) The Second Cultural Center should hold more joint meetings of reading group leaders to arrange learning materials in a timely manner.

### 北京市六区药业店员读报组  揭发资方卖假药获取暴利的罪行

    北京市六区药业店员读报组
    揭发资方卖假药获取暴利的罪行
    编辑同志：二月四日，北京市六区药业工会召开了一个药业店员读报组长联席会议，研究读报组在工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中所起的作用。
    到会组长三十多人（代表全区药业读报组组员五百人），几乎都发了言。他们一致认为读报组在运动中，起了鼓舞大家向资本家的非法行为进行斗争的勇气。屈臣氏药房读报组员姚迪生，原是该药房经理马继庸的亲戚；马继庸经常给他一些小恩小惠，背着别人给他加工资，想引诱他做些向买主打回扣、逃税、抽资金等等违法行为。这个运动刚开始时，姚迪生的思想是矛盾的。但经过不断地读报学习，并得到工会同志的说服教育，他终于检举了马继庸的犯法行为。
    会上，各读报组长揭穿了资方卖假药获取暴利的罪恶行为。像梁光明眼药店出售的“珍珠八宝拨云散”，根本没有配入必需的细料药（如熊胆）。牛黄应该是主要配料之一，但在去年一年售出的一万四千瓶眼药中，放进的牛黄不足一两。该药质量完全相同，但却以三千、五千、一万、一万五千、两万等五种价格出售。这种情况，虽经工人屡次提出，但资方却无耻地说：“价钱低了，药就没有威信”。反欺诈、反暴利斗争展开了，资方还威胁工人说：“今后赔不赔钱就在你们”。同德堂在一九四九年以五百元买进狗肾，但在一九五○年，却把狗肾作海狗肾，作价三万元一个卖出去；同样的牛黄清心丸，只因腊皮上的印记不同，就分别售卖四千、六千、八千元等三种价钱；牛黄上清丸中根本没有牛黄；羚羊解毒丸中根本没有羚羊犀角。恒济堂所售眼药，号称含有四川炉甘石，但实际上放的是甘石粉、绿豆面和熟石膏（石膏是热性，会烧眼睛），而应配放的牛黄、珍珠、麝香却根本没有。同济堂所售的三肾粉、鹿肾、海狗肾都是假货；山参的成本每斤八十万元，售价竟达到四百万元，获取很大暴利。德寿堂用白杆参当西洋参卖，每斤卖一百六十万元，而成本每斤只值三十万元。西药方面，有些药房以普通鱼肝油当鱼肝油精卖，可获利七倍；收买盘尼西林空瓶，装上假盘尼西林；用糖浆充甘油；以花生油代橄榄油等等（药业工会应发动广大药业店员，继续揭发药业资本家的贪图暴利、不顾人民的生命健康的犯罪行为，提交给政府依法处理——编者）。
    根据各读报组长汇报的情况来看，很多药房是有问题的。遍设全国、有几百年历史的达仁堂药店，竟把一种固本膏，分用八种药名卖出，且分标各种售价，获取暴利。该店读报组长项根庭说：“这种不合理的事，我从小来这儿作工就摸底，这种欺诈、获取暴利的行为，在这个运动中一定要洗刷干净”。会议决定：（一）今后读报组要更好地进行学习，通过读报来提高店员的政治觉悟，继续在这个运动中发动大家检举资方的罪恶行为；（二）普遍推广德寿堂职工成立的医药常识学习小组的经验，以监督资方卖假药的非法行为。（三）第二文化馆应多召开读报组长联席会议，及时布置学习材料。
