    [This Newspaper's Report] The Central People's Government's Ministry of Labor held a general staff meeting on the 7th to struggle against Li Qianxing, a corrupt element in the Labor Dispute Resolution Department of the Ministry of Labor, who accepted bribes from capitalists, betrayed the interests of the working class, and refused to confess.

    The corrupt element, Li Qianxing, was an employee of the Labor Dispute Resolution Department of the Central Labor Department. In 1950, he was assigned to assist the Hongrentang Chinese Medicine Shops in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao in drafting collective labor contracts. Li Qianxing not only failed to do his best to protect the interests of the workers, but instead echoed the sentiments of the capitalists, criticizing the workers and saying that "the workers' demands were too high." Because Li Qianxing sided with the capitalists, the labor dispute dragged on for several months without a collective labor contract being signed. It was not until December of the same year, with the direct assistance of the National Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union, that the signing of the Hongrentang collective labor contract was completed. During the contract signing process, Li Qianxing frequently ate at Hongrentang and "borrowed money" from the manager, Yang Xiyuan, who "gave" him one million yuan. After the contract was signed, Yang visited Li Qianxing's home and gave him another 500,000 yuan, asking Li to "help out more" in the future. After committing the crime of accepting bribes from the bourgeoisie, Li became determined to serve the bourgeoisie. Whenever labor disputes occurred at Hongrentang, Yang Xiyuan would call Li, asking him to "mediate"; but this was firmly stopped by the Central Labor Department. In March 1951, Li's theft of a bicycle and sale of drugs were discovered, and he was sentenced to three years in prison by the court. However, Li's crime of betraying the interests of the working class was not exposed until after the launch of the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The Central Labor Department sent people to educate Li, urging him to thoroughly confess his crime of betraying the interests of the working class. However, in the face of conclusive evidence and witnesses, Li still refused to confess at the meeting, arousing the anger of all staff members, who unanimously demanded severe punishment. The Central Labor Department's Thrift and Inspection Committee accepted the demands of the masses and filed a complaint with the People's Court, requesting the court to severely punish Li.

    At the meeting, Minister Li Lisan pointed out in his speech that Li Qianxing's behavior of accepting bribes from capitalists and betraying the interests of the working class while handling labor disputes was a shameful crime of directly betraying the working class and should be punished more severely than ordinary corrupt elements. Minister Li Lisan said that labor administrative departments are organs of the People's Government that protect labor and the interests of the working class. The bourgeoisie always tries to use various despicable means to entice and buy off staff members of labor departments, or directly send people to infiltrate, attempting to gradually transform the organs that protect the interests of the working class into organs that protect the interests of the bourgeoisie through these agents. In the past, the Central Labor Department and labor administrative departments in various localities were not vigilant enough against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, labor bureaus in various localities have successively discovered some people who have been seduced and bought off by the bourgeoisie, sided with the capitalists in mediating disputes, and betrayed the interests of the workers. This shows how serious the bourgeoisie's erosion of labor administrative departments is. The workers in some places scold the labor bureau as the "capitalist labor bureau," which is not without basis. Therefore, labor administrative departments should pay special attention to this issue in the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, conduct a thorough investigation, and be sure to completely expose those running dogs who have been bought off by the bourgeoisie and sent in by the bourgeoisie, and give them the punishment they deserve, in order to eliminate the bourgeoisie's "strongholds" within the labor administrative departments. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct a practical review of past work, eliminate the erosion of bourgeois ideology in business policies and practices, and only in this way can labor administrative departments truly assume the responsibility of protecting labor and protecting the interests of the working class.

    Finally, Minister Li Lisan hoped that every staff member of the labor administrative departments should learn a lesson from Li Qianxing's case, thoroughly reflect on whether they have been eroded by bourgeois ideology, whether they have been seduced and bought off by the bourgeoisie, and whether they have engaged in collusive behavior with the bourgeoisie. If so, they should thoroughly confess in this movement, sever their ambiguous connections with the bourgeoisie in terms of thought and behavior, and only then can they be a loyal staff member of the labor administrative departments.

    中央劳动部举行全体工作人员大会
    斗争接受资方贿赂的贪污分子
    要求严惩出卖工人阶级利益的李乾兴
    【本报讯】中央人民政府劳动部在七日举行全体工作人员大会，斗争接受资本家贿赂出卖工人阶级利益而拒不坦白的贪污分子李乾兴。
    贪污分子李乾兴，是中央劳动部劳资争议处理司的职员。一九五○年，他被派协助北京、天津、青岛的宏仁堂国药店订立劳资集体合同。李乾兴不仅没有尽力维护工人的利益，反而跟着资方一鼻孔出气，批评工人，说“工人的要求过高”。由于李乾兴袒护资方，使劳资争议，拖延几个月之久，还没有把劳资集体合同订起来。直到同年十二月，在中国店员工会全国委员会直接帮助下，才完成了宏仁堂劳资集体合同的签订工作。在签订合同过程中，李乾兴便常在宏仁堂吃饭，并向该堂经理杨西园“借钱”，杨即“送给”他一百万元。在合同签订完毕后，杨又到李乾兴家里拜访，送给他五十万元，请李往后“多多帮忙”。李犯自接受资产阶级的贿赂后，便决心为资产阶级效劳。宏仁堂每发生劳资纠纷时，杨西园便打电话给李犯，请他去“调处”；但为中央劳动部所坚决制止。一九五一年三月，李犯盗窃自行车及贩卖毒品的行为被发觉后，被送往法院判处三年徒刑。但李犯出卖工人阶级利益的罪行，直到这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展以后才被检举出来。中央劳动部曾派人对李犯进行教育，要他彻底坦白其出卖工人阶级利益的罪行。但李犯在确凿的人证物证面前，在这次大会上仍拒不坦白，引起全体工作人员的愤怒，一致要求严惩。中央劳动部节约检查委员会接受群众要求，向人民法院控告，请求法院严厉惩办李犯。
    会上，李立三部长讲话时指出，李乾兴处理劳资争议时，接受资方贿赂，出卖工人阶级利益的行为是直接叛变工人阶级的可耻罪行，应比普通贪污分子加重处刑。李立三部长说，劳动行政部门是人民政府保护劳动、保护工人阶级利益的机关。资产阶级总想用各种卑鄙手腕来诱惑收买劳动部门的工作人员，或者直接派人混进来，企图通过这些代理人来把保护工人阶级利益的机关逐渐变为保护资产阶级利益的机关。在过去，中央劳动部以及各地劳动行政部门，对资产阶级的猖狂进攻是不够警惕的。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，各地劳动局都陆续发现有一些受资产阶级勾引收买，在调处争议时，袒护资方，出卖工人利益的分子，可见资产阶级对劳动行政部门的侵蚀是如何严重。有些地方的工人骂劳动局是“资动局”，不是毫无根据的。所以劳动行政部门在此次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，应当特别重视这个问题，进行一次彻底的清查，务必把那些被资产阶级收买和资产阶级派进来的走狗，完全检举出来，并给以应得的处分，以清除资产阶级在劳动行政部门内部的“据点”。同时要对过去的工作进行切实的检查，肃清在业务方针和作法方面的资产阶级思想的侵蚀，只有这样劳动行政部门才能真正负起保护劳动、保护工人阶级利益的责任。
    最后李立三部长希望每一个劳动行政部门的工作人员，应该从李乾兴的案件中取得教训，彻底地反省自己是否曾经被资产阶级思想所侵蚀，是否曾被资产阶级诱惑、收买，是否有与资产阶级勾勾搭搭的行为。如果有，应在这次运动中彻底坦白，从思想上、行为上斩断与资产阶级的暗昧联系，才能做一个劳动行政部门的忠实工作人员。
