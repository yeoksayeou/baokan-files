Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th dispatch: The British Conservative government announced a new "super austerity" plan in the House of Commons on January 29th, attempting to save the increasingly unmanageable war-preparedness economic crisis by drastically suppressing the living standards of the British people. This cruel measure of the Conservative government immediately met with resolute opposition from the British people and caused panic and unease within the British ruling group.

The decision announced by the Conservative government fully illustrates the critical state of the British war economy. According to a report by United Press, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler reported to the reconvened House of Commons on January 29th on the government's "series of shocking measures" drafted to "save Britain from bankruptcy." These emergency measures include a substantial reduction in the import of food and daily necessities, which the British people already find extremely lacking, a substantial reduction in funding for the national health service, the abolition of free medical care, a reduction in housing construction, a reduction in the supply of steel to civilian industries, and a reduction in education funding and other non-military expenditures. Butler stated that if these measures were not taken, "famine and unemployment would occur in the British Isles, and disaster would also occur in other countries of the Commonwealth." He said: "The people of the whole country should understand that the government is doing this because the situation is urgent." At the same time, Butler unreservedly admitted that the reason he was asking the British people to make further "sacrifices" was only so that "the government can implement the national defense plan as soon as possible," and that if this were not done, "this national defense plan cannot be realized."

This behavior of the Conservative government in openly exploiting and harming the people to carry out the U.S. war-preparation orders immediately aroused protests from the broad masses of the British people. The British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 30th, denouncing the Conservative government for "choosing the path of cutting the people's food to support the Conservative Party's wars in Korea, Malaya, and Egypt and the preparations for the anti-Soviet war." On the same day, the British Peace Committee also issued a statement calling on the British people to strengthen the peace movement and put Britain on the path of peace and understanding in order to relieve the heavy burden of armament expansion threatening the British people. On February 1st, the executive committee of the London Trades Council, representing 650,000 workers, announced that it would organize a grand demonstration to protest against the British government's new "austerity" plan, and would also hold protest demonstrations in various districts of London.

The Conservative government's so-called "austerity" plan has also caused turmoil within the British ruling group. United Press, in reporting the situation of Butler's announcement of this decision in the House of Commons, said: "This announcement greatly shocked the newly reconvened House of Commons." In view of the fact that this frantic attack on the living standards of the British people would inevitably cause fierce resistance from the broad masses, the opposition Labour Party, with the obvious intention of winning over the people, launched a massive attack on Butler's plan in Parliament. Labour MP Bevan revealed the worries of the upper echelons of the Labour Party in his speech, accusing "the government of stirring up a huge wave of opposition at home," thereby fueling the influence of the British Communist Party. In this situation, the Labour opposition moved in the House of Commons on January 30th, demanding a vote of no confidence in the Conservative government, declaring that they had no confidence in "a government whose current policies are so different from the optimistic statements it made when it first came to power." In the course of two days of intense debate, many Labour MPs spoke out against the Conservative government. Former Labour government Chancellor of the Exchequer Gaitskell said that the plan announced by Butler proved the "extreme fraudulent nature" of the promises made by the Conservative Party to win the election. Labour opposition leader and former Prime Minister Attlee also hypocritically attacked these measures as an attempt to "sacrifice the poorer sections of society to balance the books," believing that these methods "cannot remedy the current situation." Labour MP Bevan angrily denounced Churchill as "incompetent" and "betraying the trust of the people." Finally, when the Parliament voted on the Labour Party's motion of confidence on January 31st, the Conservative government barely maintained its position with a slim majority. However, with the growth of the British people's resistance, the Conservative government's unpopular rule is clearly facing increasing difficulties.

    奉行美国备战政策经济危机愈来愈不可收拾
    邱吉尔政府疯狂压低英国人民生活水平
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：英国保守党政府一月二十九日在英国议会下院宣布了新的“超级节约”计划，企图以猛烈压低英国人民的生活水平来挽救愈来愈不可收拾的备战经济危机。保守党政府这种残民以逞的措施，立即遭到了英国人民的坚决反对，并在英国统治集团内部引起了惶恐和不安。
    保守党政府所宣布的这个决定，充分说明了英国备战经济的危急状况。据合众社消息，英国财政大臣巴特勒一月二十九日向复会的下院报告政府所拟订的“挽救英国免遭破产”的“一连串令人震惊的措施”。这些紧急措施包括大量削减英国人民已经极感缺少的食品和日用必需品的进口，大量削减国民保健事业经费、取消免费诊疗制度，减少房屋建筑，削减民用工业的钢铁供应，减少教育经费和其他非军用开支。巴特勒表示，如果不采取这些措施，“英伦三岛便将发生饥饿和失业，而联邦其他国家也将要发生灾难。”他说：“全国人民应当了解政府这样做是由于情况紧急。”同时，巴特勒毫不掩饰地承认，他之所以要求英国人民作进一步的“牺牲”，只是为了“政府要尽快实现国防计划”，而如果不这样做，“就无法实现这个国防计划”。
    保守党政府这种公开剥削和残害人民以执行美国备战命令的行为，立刻激起了英国广大群众的抗议。英国共产党的《工人日报》三十日发表社论，痛斥保守党政府“选择了削减人民食物的道路来支持保守党在朝鲜、马来亚、埃及的战争和反苏战争的准备工作”。同一天，英国和平委员会也发表声明，号召英国人民加强和平运动，使英国走上和平与谅解的道路，以解除威胁英国人民的扩军重担。二月一日，代表六十五万工人的伦敦工会理事会执行委员会宣布将组织盛大的示威游行，抗议英国政府的新“节约”计划，同时并将在伦敦各区分别举行抗议示威。
    保守党政府的所谓“节约”计划，也在英国统治集团内部引起了骚动。合众社在报道巴特勒在议会下院宣布这个决定的情况时说：“这项宣布使得刚复会的下院大为震惊。”鉴于这种对英国人民生活水平的疯狂进攻必将引起广大群众的猛烈反抗，现政府的反对党工党抱着明显的笼络人心的目的，在议会中对巴特勒的计划大肆攻击。工党议员比万在发言中透露了工党上层分子的忧虑，他斥责“政府在国内激起了反对的巨浪”，因而助长了英国共产党的影响。在这种情形下，工党反对派一月三十日在下院提出动议，要求对保守党政府举行不信任投票，他们声明对“一个目前政策与它当初上台时发表的乐观声明如此截然不同的政府没有信任”。在连续两天的激烈辩论中，许多工党议员都发言斥责保守党政府，前工党政府财政大臣贾兹克尔说，巴特勒宣布的计划证明了保守党为赢得选举胜利而提出的诺言的“极端欺诈的性质”。工党反对派领袖、前任首相艾德礼也假惺惺地攻击这些措施是企图“牺牲社会中的贫苦阶层来平衡收支”，他认为这些办法“并不能补救目前局势”。工党议员比万痛骂邱吉尔“不称职”，“背弃了人们的信托”。最后，当议会在一月三十一日对工党提出的信任案进行表决时，保守党政府只是靠了微弱的多数勉强保持住地位。但是随着英国人民反抗的增长，保守党政府失尽民心的统治显然要遭到愈来愈多的困难。
