    Introducing Amado and Guillén—Two Outstanding Cultural Warriors of Latin America
    Xiāo Sān

    (I)
    About forty kilometers from Prague, in the small town of Dobříš, stands a magnificent palace. Inside, many of the rooms and halls are high and large. Murals, oil paintings, and colored paintings of landscapes and figures, large and small mirror frames... adorn the rooms and corridors. The steps are covered with red velvet carpets. Large, coarse mats for wiping feet are woven with the initials of the former owner. But that was the past owner, a Czech nobleman. Now, the owner of this palace is the Czech Writers' Association.
    Czech writers and artists have the opportunity and the right to come to this quiet and comfortable place to engage in creation or recuperation. The president of Charles University, famous actors of the People's Theatre, outstanding political cartoonists, film directors... all come here for short or long stays. It can be called a creation home, or a palace of culture.
    Here, training classes for novice writers, training classes for newspaper and magazine editors, etc., are also held regularly.
    In the summer of last year, I also stayed here for a while.
    In the very spacious backyard, in front of meticulously cultivated flowerbeds and fountains, in the center of benches, recliners, and armchairs, an iron table had a wide strip of flowered cloth as a large umbrella. Several of us were sheltering under the umbrella. A four or five-year-old child came out of the large glass-framed iron gate and kept crawling under the table... After a while, a middle-aged man with a slightly dark complexion, black hair, and a black beard came out, constantly shouting, "João! João! Mom wants you to come back..." The child was naughty, crawled out from under the table and ran away again. The father with the thick black beard spread his hands and said "Damn." He caught sight of the new guests and warmly shook hands with us with a smile. This was Jorge Amado.
    One summer, we became very close friends with this outstanding Brazilian writer. He lived in this "writers' castle" for many years and wrote many works. He is a very enthusiastic person. He is enthusiastic about life, enthusiastic about the people, enthusiastic about the revolutionary cause. This enthusiasm is evident in his discussions, his creations, and his social activities. He is not only an outstanding writer, but also an active warrior. He has been forced to leave his homeland for several years, but he has not stopped working for his country for a single day. His working ability is amazing. He has written fifteen works in twenty years. On the day before leaving Prague, he still squeezed in time to finish the last chapter of his new novel "The Stony Land."
    Let's take a look at his resume. Amado, now under forty years old, was born in 1912 in the state of Bahia, Brazil, an area that mainly produces cocoa. He spent his childhood here. Later, he wrote three novels about the lives of these cocoa plantation workers. In his youth, he lived with some black workers and porters in the metropolis of this state. The atmosphere of life in Bahia is often depicted in his novels.
    In 1930, he went to Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil. In 1932, he came into contact with the Communist Youth League, and from then on, he became a writer participating in actual struggles.
    Amado published his first novel in 1931, at the age of nineteen. In 1933, he published "Cocoa." This novel shattered the past Brazilian novels depicting field life and the false tradition of singing praises to rural beauty, and honestly exposed the cruel suffering in the countryside. Because of participating in the "People's Liberation Alliance" movement, Amado was arrested for the first time in 1936.
    In 1937, he traveled to various countries in the Americas. When he returned to Brazil, he was arrested again in the Amazon Province. After the fascist coup in 1937, the government ordered the banning of Amado's works, which were collected and burned in the public square.
    From 1938 to 1940, he was arrested several times. In 1941, he escaped to Argentina. There he wrote "The Life of Luís Carlos Prestes." This book greatly helped the work of rescuing the great leader of the Brazilian people, who was sentenced to forty-eight years and eight months in prison. After returning to Brazil, Amado was arrested again in 1942. Thanks to the support of the masses and the solidarity of the cultural circles throughout the American continent, he was released. However, the police station designated the city of Bahia as Amado's forced residence from 1943 to 1944.
    In early 1945, he moved to São Paulo. At that time, the Communist Party had become a legal party. He became the editor-in-chief of the São Paulo newspaper (the Communist Party newspaper). In 1945, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly. In January 1948, he was expelled from the National Assembly.
    He traveled to Europe and participated in the Wroclaw World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace. The Brazilian government was unhappy with his speech at the conference and filed a lawsuit against him in court. He recently finished a book about the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, titled "The World of Peace." His literary works have been translated into twenty-two languages. His main works include: "Jubiabá," "Sea of Death," "Suhweat," "The Violent Land," "The Starved Roads," "Captains of the Sands," and "The Life of Prestes." His work "The Stony Land" is a novel depicting Brazilian political life.
    In December 1951, Amado was awarded the Stalin Prize for Strengthening International Peace. He himself is the responsible secretary of the International Peace Prize Judging Committee of the World Peace Council.
    This year, 1952, marks the 20th anniversary of Amado's creative work and the 20th anniversary of his joining the Brazilian Communist Party.

    Also in this Czech writers' palace in Dobříš, we met Guillén. His bronze-colored face, kind eyes, slightly gray hair, humble and elder demeanor, made us feel like old friends at first sight.
    He is a well-known people's poet and singer in Latin America. His poems are sung by millions of people. His "Sailor's Song," we always asked him to recite at every gathering, and we never tired of listening to it.
    Nicolás Guillén is currently fifty years old, born in 1902 in Camagüey, Cuba. His father was a member of the Senate and sacrificed in the revolutionary struggle against the Conservative Party in 1917. Guillén began his studies in his birthplace. In 1919, he obtained a diploma in secondary literature and science. He immediately enrolled in the University of Havana. It was there that he began to study law. But a year later, he switched to studying poetry and journalism.
    In 1930, he published his first collection of poems. This is poetry of the common people, containing the rhythms of the Spanish serenade tradition, and it is also a revolution in Cuban poetry. In 1931, "Sóngoro Cosongo" was published, also poetry of the common people, receiving the same welcome. In 1934, "West Indies Limited" published another collection of his poems. At this time, he was writing about social problems, poems of protest and struggle against imperialism. In 1937, "Song for Soldiers and Song for Travelers" was published. The first part of this collection calls on soldiers to fight side by side with the common people who share the same origin. The second part describes the typical figures of the common people of Guantánamo singing to American tourists in a bar in Havana. But it is not a song for their entertainment, but the cry of the Cuban people oppressed and exploited by imperialists for poverty and hunger. In the same year, Guillén went to Spain, which was at the most intense period of the anti-Franco war. He personally participated in the Spanish people's struggle for freedom. There he wrote "Spain: Four Anguishes and One Hope."
    In 1947, the Pleamar Bookstore in Buenos Aires published a selection of Guillén's poems, titled "Complete Poetry."
    Guillén traveled throughout North and South America from Canada to Chile. In Europe, he traveled to Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and the People's Democracies (except Albania). In 1949, he visited the Soviet Union. He participated in the Second Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Culture held in Spain in 1937. In 1949, he participated in the American Continental Congress for Peace in New York. In the same year, he participated in the First World Congress for Peace in Paris and the American Continental Congress for Peace held in Mexico. He is a member of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party). He represented the party at the Congress of the Czech Communist Party held in Prague in 1949.
    Guillén's works have been translated into English by the American black poet Hughes, into French by Aragon, into Russian by Ehrenburg, into German by Arendt, into Hungarian by Endre, into Polish by Śleń, into Italian by Socrates, into Portuguese by Amado...
    In terms of prose, he wrote "Faithful to the People of Spain," and he also collaborated with Marinello to write a biography of the black violinist Brindis de Salas.
    He is now the editor of "Hoy," the organ of the Cuban People's Socialist Party in Havana.
    Guillén and Amado are about to go to China. (Editor's note: Amado and Guillén arrived in Beijing on January 31st.) The day before his departure, Amado told me that Guillén had written a very beautiful "Song of China." I asked him for a copy, and he copied it for me in Spanish, writing "Dedicated to E.S." I don't understand Spanish, but after the translator translated it into French, I couldn't help but translate this song into Chinese and send it back to the country to share with readers.

    Song of China
    I want to go to China to see,
    And talk to the old dragon [note]...
    --Talk to the old dragon?
    You don't need to go:
    That dragon has already flown away.
    Smoking my pipe, I dream leisurely,
    Wanting to forget my pain in the smoke...
    --Forget your pain?
    You don't need to smoke:
    Wake up in life—it's even sweeter.
    Oh, will he come again, will he come back,
    That terrible master of my rice paddies!
    --That master of your rice paddies!
    He doesn't need to come back:
    The people are planting his ideas in the fields.
    I want to wander among the withered lotuses,
    And cherish their past glory...
    --Their past glory?
    You don't need to wander:
    Look at those lotuses: painted on tractors.

    (III)
    Amado, Guillén, and their wives boarded the plane with great joy, and my heart flew with them, all the way to Beijing, to Shanghai... May they have a safe journey, and I am glad that our people, after seeing another outstanding cultural warrior from South America, the famous Chilean poet Neruda, can also talk to these two sincere friends about everything. I am here sending them off with a hint of jealousy, believing that comrades will surely welcome them with unparalleled enthusiasm. I want to tell you that you will soon feel: they are really lovely!
    [Note] In Western countries, the dragon is often regarded as a symbol of ferocity, here it also refers to ancient China.

    介绍亚马多和吉里安——拉丁美洲的两位杰出的文化战士
    萧三
    （一）
    离布拉格四十多公里的多布日史小镇上有一所富丽堂皇的宫院。里面的许多房间、厅室又高又大。壁画啦，风景人物的油画彩色画啦，大大小小的镜框啦……挂满了房间和走廊。梯阶上铺的是红绒地毯。擦脚的大块粗毯上织的是主人名姓的简写。但那是过去的主人，捷克的一个贵族。现在呢，这宫院的主人是捷克作家协会。
    捷克的作家、艺术家有机会和权利到这清静安适的地方来从事创作，或者休养。卡尔大学的校长，人民戏院的名演员，杰出的政治漫画家，电影导演……都来这里小住或长住。说它是创作之家也可以，说它是文化之宫也行。
    在这里还定期开办初学作家训练班，报刊编辑训练班等等。
    在去年的夏季，笔者也到这里小住。
    在非常广阔的后院里，在花了匠心栽培的花丛和喷水池的前面，在长凳、躺椅、围椅的中心，一张铁桌的圆面当中插着一把宽条花布块作的大伞。我们几个人在伞下遮荫。一个四五岁的孩子从玻璃的铁框大门走出来，一直往桌子底下钻……一会，走出来一个面色有点黝黑，黑头发和黑胡子的中年人，嘴里不断喊：“若望！若望！妈妈叫你回去……”孩子顽皮，从桌子下钻出来又跑掉了。浓黑胡子的父亲两手一摊，说声晦气。一眼看见了新来的客人，他含笑地、热烈地跟我们握手。这就是若时·亚马多。
    一个夏天，我们和这位巴西卓越的作家成了莫逆之交。他在这“作家堡”住了不少年月，也写了不少作品。他是非常热诚的人。他对人生热诚，对人民热诚，对革命事业热诚。这热诚见之于他的谈论，见之于他的创作，见之于他的社会活动。他不只是一个杰出的作家，同时是一个活跃的战士。他被逼离开祖国几年了，但他没有一天不为他的祖国工作。他的工作能力是惊人的。二十年之内他写了十五部作品。临离开布拉格的先一天，还挤时间写完新著小说《石壁》的最后一章。
    让我们看看他的简历吧。现在不满四十岁的亚马多一九一二年生于巴西巴依亚州一个主要出产可可的地方。在这里度过他的童年。后来他写了三本关于这些可可农场工人的生活的小说。青年时期他和一些黑种工人及搬运工人住在这个州的都会里。巴伊亚州生活的气氛，后来时常被描写于他的几部小说里面。
    一九三○年他到了巴西都城里奥热内卢。在一九三二年他和共产主义青年团接触，从此他成为参加实际斗争的作家。
    亚马多在一九三一年，十九岁的时候便出版了他的第一部小说。一九三三年出版了《可可》。这本小说把过去巴西描写田野生活的小说及爱好歌咏农村美的假传统打碎，老老实实地把农村里残酷的痛苦暴露出来。因为参加“人民解放同盟”的运动，亚马多在一九三六年第一次被捕。
    一九三七年他曾到美洲各国游历。当回巴西的时候，他在阿马松尼省又被捕。一九三七年法西斯政变后，政府下令禁止亚马多的著作，并搜集起来在广场上焚毁。
    从一九三八年至一九四○年他被逮捕了好几次。于一九四一年逃至阿根廷。他在那里写作了《路易·加尔洛·普勒斯特的生平》。这部书大有助于营救被判决监禁四十八年又八个月的巴西人民伟大领袖的工作。从回到巴西本国后，亚马多又于一九四二年被捕。由于群众的声援和全美洲大陆文化界团结力量的营救，他被释放。但警察局指定巴依亚城为亚马多从一九四三年到一九四四年强迫居留地。
    一九四五年初，他到圣保罗居住。那时共产党已成为合法的政党。他便成为圣保罗报纸（共产党报）的主编。一九四五年被选为国会议员。一九四八年一月被国会开除。
    他到欧洲游历，并参加了弗洛茨拉夫世界知识界和平会议。巴西政府不高兴他在大会上的发言，便在法院向他起诉。他最近写完了一本关于苏联和新民主国家的书，名《和平的世界》。他所写作的文学作品译成过二十二国的文字。主要著作如下：《尤比亚巴》《死海》《凶地》《金果之地》《饥饿的路途》《沙滩顽童》及《普勒斯特的生平》，他所写作的《石壁》，是描写巴西政治生活的小说。
    一九五一年十二月亚马多荣获斯大林加强国际和平奖金。他自己是世界和平理事会国际和平奖评判委员会的负责书记。
    今年，一九五二年，是亚马多从事创作的二十周年，也是他加入巴西共产党的二十周年。
    （二）
    也是在多布日史这捷克作家之宫里，我们认识了吉里安。他紫铜色的面孔，和善的眼光，微微灰白的头发，谦虚长者的风度，使人一见如故。
    他是拉丁美洲享有盛名的民众的诗人，歌手。他的诗作被千百万人民歌唱着。他的《水手之歌》，每次集会时我们总要求他诵读，百听不厌。
    尼古拉·吉里安现年五十岁，一九○二年生于古巴加马垓邑。他的父亲是上议院的议员，在一九一七年反对保守党的革命斗争中牺牲了。吉里安在他的诞生地开始念书。一九一九年得获中学文学和科学文凭。他马上就考入拉·哈瓦那大学。是在那里他开始研究法学。但一年后，他改学诗歌和新闻学。
    一九三○年他发表第一本诗集。这是平民的诗歌，包含着西班牙相思曲传统的音节，也是古巴诗歌的一个革命。一九三一年出版《松哥罗·可松哥》，也是平民的诗歌，获得同样的欢迎。一九三四年“西印有限公司”又出版他的一本诗集子。这时他已针对着社会问题写作，这是向帝国主义抗议和斗争的诗歌。一九三七年《为兵士的歌和为旅行者的歌》出版。这本诗集的第一部分是号召兵士和他们同样出身的平民并肩作战。在第二部分里写的是冈大力斯哥平民的典型人物在拉·哈瓦那酒巴店里对着美国游客唱歌。但不是为他们娱乐的歌声，而是被帝国主义者压迫和剥削的古巴人民穷苦和饥饿的呼声。同年吉里安到西班牙去，那正是反佛朗哥战争最激烈的时候。他亲身参加了西班牙人民争取自由的斗争。在那里他写成《西班牙，四种忧虑和一种希望之诗》。
    一九四七年在伯诺塞地方普列阿马书店出版吉里安诗选，名为《诗歌大全》。
    吉里安周游了从加拿大到智利的南北美洲。在欧洲他游历了西班牙、法、比、德、奥及人民民主国家（除阿尔巴尼亚外）。一九四九年他观光苏联。他曾参加过在西班牙举行的一九三七年第二届保卫文化大会。一九四九年参加过纽约美洲大陆和平大会。同年参加过巴黎第一次世界和平大会和在墨西哥召开的美洲大陆和平大会。他是古巴人民社会党（共产党）全国委员会的委员。他曾代表党参加过一九四九年在布拉格召开的捷克共产党代表大会。
    吉里安的著作曾由美国黑人诗人休士译成英文，阿拉贡译成法文，爱伦堡译成俄文，阿伦特译成德文，恩德尔译成匈牙利文，斯勒延译成波兰文，苏格拉特译成意大利文，亚马多译成葡萄牙文……
    在散文方面他写了《忠实于西班牙的人们》，又和马利内罗合作写了黑人提琴家伯兰地斯·德·莎拉斯的传记。
    现在他是拉·哈哇纳古巴人民社会党机关报《今日》的编辑。
    吉里安和亚马多马上就要去中国。（编者按：亚马多和吉里安已于一月三十一日抵北京。）在动身的前一天，亚马多告诉我吉里安写了一首很美的《中国之歌》。我向他索读，他用西班牙文抄给我，并写着“献给Ｅ·Ｓ·”我不懂西班牙文，但经译者口译成法文后，我禁不住把这首歌转译成中文，现在寄回国去，以饷读者。    
    中国之歌
    我愿意到中国去看看，
    和那条老龙〔注〕去谈谈……
    ——和老龙去谈谈？
    你用不着去了：
    那条龙已经飞走了。
    抽着烟斗我悠然地作梦，
    想在烟雾里忘掉我的苦痛……
    ——忘掉你的苦痛？
    你用不着抽烟：
    在生活里醒过来——更甜。
    呵，会再来吧，会回来吧，
    我那稻田的可怕的主人！
    ——你那稻田的主人！
    他用不着回来了：
    人民在田里种上他的意见了。
    我想在枯萎的荷花中间游荡，
    和留恋它们过去的辉煌……
    ——它们过去的辉煌？
    你用不着游荡了：
    看那荷花：画在拖拉机上了。
    （三）
    亚马多、吉里安和他们的夫人们兴高采烈地登上了飞机，我的心也随着他们飞去，一直送他们到北京，到上海……愿他们一路平安，并欣幸我国人在见过了南美洲另一杰出的文化战士，智利的名诗人聂鲁达之后，又得以和这两位真诚的朋友倾谈一切。我在此含着妒意地欢送他们，相信同志们一定用无比的热情欢迎他们。我想告诉你们，你们也很快就会感觉到：他们实在可爱！
    〔注〕龙在西方各国常被当作凶恶的象征，这里又比古老的中国。
