I Thank My Wife for Helping Me Escape the Quagmire of Corruption
Xia Maoru, Speaking
Xiuzhen, Recording

I am a shameful, major corrupt element who stole over 120 million yuan of national assets. This anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement led by Chairman Mao rescued me from the path of destruction, allowing me to be reborn and become a people's construction engineer again. In addition to deeply thanking Chairman Mao and the People's Government for their education and leniency towards me, I also thank my wife, Comrade Zhu Yanmin, for her help and encouragement. It was due to her encouragement and urging that I gained the courage to confess and thoroughly reveal all my corrupt activities, thus avoiding criminal punishment.

When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the Beijing Municipal Grain Administration Bureau was vigorously launched, my heart was hanging in the air, and I was constantly uneasy. During the most intense ideological struggle, I considered three paths: changing my name and fleeing to Hong Kong; committing suicide; or voluntarily confessing. The first two were obviously dead ends and unviable; as for the last path, although I knew it was the only way out, I was still very hesitant. I didn't know to what extent "voluntary confession can be dealt with leniently" could alleviate my punishment. After thinking it over and over again, I was really scared, so I asked for leave to return to Shanghai to discuss with my family what to do and also wanted to see my two children. So, on the morning of December 30th, I met my wife with a heavy ideological burden, told her about my corrupt crimes and the three paths I had considered, and said to her: "I really want to take the path of confession, but I am afraid in my heart. A corrupt element as big as me would at least be sentenced to ten years in prison, even if it were handled leniently with voluntary confession, it would still be three or five years, and it would be very embarrassing and have a great impact on future work relations." At first, she was very surprised to hear me say this, and she was very panicked and didn't know what to say, and I became even more afraid. But soon she calmed down and said to me: "You must confess. As for whether the government reduces your crime or to what extent, that is another issue. The problem now is: you have already done something that you are sorry for the country and the people, and you must confess your guilt to the people and express sincere repentance. You have technical skills, and as long as you are willing to serve the people, your work will definitely be needed in the future." She immediately brought paper and pen and urged me to write down the facts of corruption immediately. Under her firm encouragement and urging, I felt a hundred times more courageous and immediately wrote a letter to the Wanbei Grain Bureau, admitting that I had corrupt behavior, and also returned the remaining 50 million yuan of赃款 at home (my wife did not know that this money came from corruption). At this time, my heart was a little lighter, and then we talked about the future family problems, my wife comforted me again: "I have the ability to work, and I can afford it according to the current salary, and I can do more work in the future." In this way, my mood became more stable, and my determination to confess was also firm. That night, I took the car back to Beijing. Before leaving, looking at the two children, I felt very sad, thinking that I would not be able to see them for several years. But my wife was very calm and did not shed tears, just repeatedly told me to confess well and thoroughly, not to put the matter of punishment in my mind, and not to send money home anymore. With her repeated and firm encouragement, my mood was very stable along the way. When I arrived in Beijing, as soon as I got off the train, I thoroughly confessed the facts and process of corruption to the leadership, and also reported four related engineers.

I am really grateful to my wife. If she had cried, made a fuss, or had any concerns when I discussed it with her that day, then I really don't know what kind of changes would have occurred. Maybe I would have embarked on the two dead ends I had considered: fleeing or committing suicide, and in the end, I would not have escaped the just sanctions of the country and the people... I really dare not imagine.

My wife is a graduate of the Education Department of Shanghai University. Since getting married and having children, she has not participated in work or study, until after liberation when she participated in a short period of neighborhood work in the Women's Federation, and recently went to the Shanghai Municipal People's Bank Staff Amateur School to teach, but she is progressing much faster than me. Recently, she said in her letter to me: I am grateful to Chairman Mao and the People's Government. This anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement saved my husband and also made me more clearly recognize and appreciate the greatness and wisdom of Chairman Mao. She also told me that she had retrieved the 30 million yuan of贓款 that I had given to my father-in-law to do business in the past and sent it to the Wanbei Grain Bureau. She wants me to gradually pay off all the money I embezzled. I am very moved and also very ashamed. Only by working and studying a hundred times harder in the future can I make up for my mistakes and be worthy of Chairman Mao.

### 我感谢妻子帮助我脱离了贪污的泥坑

    我感谢妻子帮助我脱离了贪污的泥坑

    秀珍  记
    我是一个盗窃国家资财一亿二千多万元的可耻的大贪污犯。这次毛主席领导的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，把我从死路上拯救出来，使我得到新生，重新做个人民的建筑工程师。我除了深深感谢毛主席和人民政府对我的教育和宽大外，我还感谢我的妻子——朱延民同志对我的帮助和鼓励，由于她的鼓励和督促，使我增强了坦白的勇气，把贪污事实全部彻底交代清楚，免除了刑事处分。
    当北京市粮食管理总局的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动猛烈开展以后，我的心像吊在半空，终日惶惶不安。思想斗争到最激烈的时候，我曾考虑了三条道路：改名换姓逃到香港去；自杀；自动坦白。前两条显然是死路，走不通；对于后面一条路，虽然知道是唯一生路，心里仍然很犹豫，不知道“自动坦白可以从轻处理”究竟能减轻到什么程度？想来想去实在害怕，就请了假回上海和家里商量商量该怎么办，同时也想回去看看两个孩子。于是在十二月三十号那天早上，我背着沉重的思想包袱见到了我的妻子，把我的贪污罪行和我考虑的三条路都告诉了她，并且对她说：“我很想走坦白的路，可是心里又害怕，像我这样大的贪污犯，至少得判十年徒刑，即使自动坦白从轻处理的话，也得三年五载，并且多难为情，对将来的工作关系也很大。”起初，她听我这么一说大吃一惊，情绪非常惊惶，不知说什么好，我也更加害怕起来。但是不久她就镇静下来，对我说：“一定去坦白。至于政府减不减你的罪，减轻到什么程度，那是另一个问题，现在的问题是：你已经做了对不起国家人民的事，你就要向人民坦白认罪，并表示真诚悔改。你是有技术的，只要你肯为人民服务，将来的工作一定会需要你。”她立刻拿来了纸和笔，督促我马上把贪污事实写出来。我在她这样坚定的鼓励和督促下，不觉勇气百倍，立刻写了一封信到皖北粮食局去，承认自己有贪污行为，并把家里剩下的赃款五千万元也退了回去（这笔款子我妻子不知道是贪污来的）。这时我的心比较轻松了一些，接着又谈起今后的家庭问题来，我的妻子又安慰我说：“我有工作能力，按照目前的薪金可以负担起来，并且以后还可以多做些工作。”这样我的情绪更安定了，坦白的决心也坚定了，当晚就趁车返北京。临走的时候，看看两个孩子，心里很难过，想到不知几年后才能看到他们。可是我的妻子却非常镇静，也没有流泪，只是再三嘱咐我要好好彻底坦白，不要把处分的事搁在心里，钱也不用再寄回家。经她这样再三而坚定的鼓励，一路上我的情绪非常安定。到了北京，一下火车我就把贪污的事实和经过情形向领导方面彻底地交代出来，还检举了四个有关的工程师。
    我真是感谢我的妻子，要是那天和她商量时，她哭哭啼啼吵吵闹闹，或者有顾虑的话，那么真不知道要发生什么样的变化，可能我就走上了我所考虑到的两条死路：逃跑或自杀，而最后终于逃不脱国家人民对我正义的制裁……我真不敢想像。
    我的妻子是沪江大学教育系的毕业生，自从结婚有了孩子以后就没有参加工作或学习，直到解放后才参加过一个短时期家庭妇联的里弄工作，最近才到上海市人民银行职工业余学校教书，可是她却比我进步快得多。最近她给我的信上说：我感激毛主席和人民政府，这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动救了我的丈夫，也使我更清楚地认识和体会到毛主席的伟大、英明。她还告诉我，她已将过去我交给岳父做生意的三千万元赃款取回，寄给皖北粮食局。她要我把所贪污的全部款子陆续还清。我很感动，也很惭愧，以后只有百倍的努力工作和学习，才能弥补我的错误，也才能对得起毛主席。
