Eliminate the奸商 Who Secretly Harmed the Volunteer Army

People's Artist Lao She

Look at what these people below have done:

    Wang Defu and others in Hangzhou, who were commissioned to make food for the Volunteer Army, cut corners and used stone alkali powder that made mouths dry instead of baking soda.

    Hu Hengqing in Shanghai, who contracted to produce military shoes for the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, cut corners and corrupted cadres.

    Li Yinting and others in Wuhan, who contracted to produce first-aid kits for the Volunteer Army, not only failed to sterilize the cotton but also mixed it with rotten cotton picked up from garbage dumps; when Volunteer Army wounded used it, their injuries worsened, and they even lost limbs or their lives.

    Wang Kangnian in Shanghai defrauded the Volunteer Army of huge sums of money for medicine purchases and engaged in speculative business; while the front lines urgently needed medicine, he delayed delivery, delaying the recovery of the sick and wounded.

    And more, and more… I can't write any more!

Which person in the whole country, regardless of gender or age, doesn’t love the "most beloved people"? Who wouldn’t want to put forth their greatest effort to support the "most beloved people"? But there are actually the above-mentioned 奸商, greedy for huge profits, who use vicious methods to secretly harm our Volunteer Army! The Volunteer Army faces brutal enemies, but there are people behind them secretly assassinating them! These 奸商 are also Chinese, and they have been able to live and work in peace because of the protection and love of the Volunteer Army, but they are willing to harm their benefactors! I cannot recognize them as Chinese because they are not human at all! Compatriots, are we willing to associate with jackals and poisonous snakes? If we are tolerant of them, how can we be worthy of the People's Volunteer Army? We demand that the government give these beasts in human form the most severe punishment!

At the same time, we must step up our encirclement and suppression of this kind of 奸商, and not let one escape the law! If anyone still doubts: Are the bourgeoisie frantically attacking us? Would the bourgeoisie be so lacking in morality? Now it can be fully understood. They are not only attacking us, but also colluding with the American imperialist aggressor troops to attack our Volunteer Army from within and without! They are not only lacking in morality, but also lacking in morality all the way to the Korean front! It is easy to dodge a bullet from the front, but the hardest to guard against are arrows shot in secret; the Volunteer Army heroes are not afraid of the American imperialist aggressors, but how can they defend against the bad biscuits and dirty cotton from the 奸商? The American aggressors should be eliminated, and this group of villains who shoot arrows in secret should also be eliminated! Do not let one go!

Perhaps some people say: Those who are harmed by secret arrows are not very many, right? This is a muddled idea! We must know that those who are harmed are not others, but the Volunteer Army who are defending the country and resisting America and aiding Korea; even one death is unacceptable! Even if one hero is given something bad to eat and gets a stomachache, it is unacceptable! Anyone who dares to deliberately make bad biscuits for the heroes is a traitor! Even if only one Volunteer Army comrade suffers pain or harm, we must settle accounts with the 奸商! If we hear someone insulting the Volunteer Army, can we agree to it? No! How much more so when it damages the health and safety of the Volunteer Army? Can we love our heroes on the one hand and condone the 奸商 who secretly harm the heroes on the other? If there really is such a person, he is almost the same as the 奸商. These 奸商 not only have no patriotism, but also have no national concept at all; we are irreconcilable with them! If we turn a blind eye, do not investigate, do not report, and do not relentlessly encircle and suppress these accomplices of American imperialism, where is our own patriotism?

Patriotic people, arise! The Volunteer Army is killing the enemy on the Korean front, and we must kill the enemy in the rear—aren't the 奸商 who are willing to be enemies with the Volunteer Army also our enemies?

### 扑灭暗害志愿军的奸商

    扑灭暗害志愿军的奸商
    人民艺术家　老舍
    看看下边这些人干的事吧：
    杭州汪德孚等，代制慰劳志愿军的食品，偷工减料，用吃了嘴就发干的石碱粉代替苏打。
    上海的胡恒庆，承办解放军与志愿军军鞋，偷工减料，腐蚀干部。
    武汉的李寅廷等，承制志愿军用的救急包，不但棉花没有消毒，而且搀上由垃圾堆拣来的烂棉花；志愿军伤员用了，伤势加重，甚至损失了手脚，或牺牲了性命。
    上海的王康年，骗取志愿军买药巨款，作投机生意；前线需要药品急如星火，他却迟不交货，耽误了伤病员恢复健康。
    还有，还有……我写不下去了！
    全国的人民，不分男女老幼，哪一个不热爱那“最可爱的人”？哪一个不愿出最大的力量，支援那“最可爱的人”？可是居然有上列的奸商，贪暴利，下毒手，暗害我们的志愿军！志愿军面对暴敌，背后却还有人暗中行刺！这些奸商也是中国人，也受了志愿军的保卫惠爱，才得以安居乐业，可是甘心陷害他们的恩人！我没法子承认他们是中国人，因为他们根本不是人！同胞们，我们难道甘心与豺狼毒蛇为伍么？我们若是宽容了他们，怎么对得起人民志愿军呢？我们要求政府给这些人面兽心的东西以最严厉的制裁！
    同时，我们要加紧包剿这类的奸商，不教一个逍遥法外！若还有人怀疑：资产阶级是否猖狂地向我们进攻？资产阶级是否会那么缺德？现在可以完全明白了。他们岂止进攻我们，而且与美帝国主义的侵略军里外夹攻我们的志愿军啊！他们岂止缺德，而且是缺德到了朝鲜前线啊！明枪容易躲，暗箭最难防；志愿军英雄们不怕美国侵略者的进犯，可是怎能防备奸商们的坏饼干与脏棉花呢？美国侵略者应当消灭，这群放暗箭的坏东西也应当消灭！不许放走一个！
    也许有人说：被暗箭伤害的或者并不很多吧？这是胡涂想法！要知道，受损害的不是别人，是保家卫国、抗美援朝的志愿军哪；死一个也不成！就是教一位英雄吃了坏东西，弄坏了肚子也不成！敢给英雄们故意制造坏饼干的就是卖国贼！尽管只有一位志愿军同志受了痛苦或损害，我们也得跟奸商算账！假若我们听见有人辱骂了志愿军一句，我们能答应他吗？不能！何况是损害了志愿军的健康与安全呢？难道我们能够一方面热爱我们的英雄，另一方面却姑息暗害英雄们的奸商吗？假若真有这样的人，他与奸商就差不多是一路货。这些奸商不但没有爱国心，也根本没有国家观念，我们跟他们势不两立！我们若是视而不见，不调查，不检举，不穷追包剿这些美帝国主义的帮凶，我们自己的爱国心又在哪儿呢？
    爱国的人民，起来！志愿军在朝鲜前线杀敌，我们得在后方杀敌——甘心与志愿军为仇作对的奸商难道还不是咱们的敌人么？
