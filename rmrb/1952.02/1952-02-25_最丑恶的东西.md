On the "tiger-fighting" front line, I deeply feel that: the unscrupulous merchant is one of the ugliest things in the world.

No matter when I think of it, it makes me sick and arouses a feeling of hatred towards it.

We—a "tiger-fighting" combat team, while fighting in a "tiger's den"—a fur and leather depot—we saw the ever-changing conspiracies and the bizarrely ugly faces of the unscrupulous merchants.

A manager, so fat he could hardly walk, when asked about his illegal activities, would put on a mournful face, wrinkle his nose, roll his eyes, scratch his ears, and rub his cheeks, feigning anxiety. He would mutter to himself, "Aha, I confess—no, what are you asking me to say? Aren't you making things difficult for me?" He would be so anxious that he seemed about to cry, as if he were suffering an "unjust grievance." Then, we would enlighten him with reason, asking if he still wanted to be a legitimate businessman and live in society; we would persuade him with his own interests in mind, hoping that for the sake of his wife and children, he would choose a path to survival. Thereupon, the manager would burst into tears, with snot and tears streaming down his face, saying that he still had a seventy-year-old mother paralyzed in bed… Sobbing and sniffling, his whole fat body would tremble, crying so sadly that he really looked like a "poor wretch." When we continued to question him, he would collapse like a pile of mud, kneeling in the dust, begging bitterly, saying that he really had no problems.

Some of our kind and naive young students were misled by him: "This time we've touched his heart, maybe there really are no problems?" However, when we received tip-offs from relevant authorities, and when, as a result of our unwavering pursuit, we discovered a large number of shocking and appalling criminal facts, even the young students, as pure as a blank sheet of paper, were aroused with the flames of hatred.

It was none other than this weeping and wailing manager who had corrupted eighteen of our cadres, and he had become the leader of the "tiger's den." He had a long line, a large net, reaching from Beijing and Tianjin, west to Taiyuan, and north to Heilongjiang, with people falling into his trap everywhere. He had a set of vicious "tactics": first, smoking, drinking tea, watching plays, and eating meals, until: "You supply-system cadres have a hard life, brothers lend you money to spend" – stuffing a wad of bills into their hands; then: "Comrade ××, I'll give you two hero shares, each share is ten million, and when we make money in the future, we'll all spend it together!" In this way, he pulled cadres into "hero shares." He knew that they wouldn't dare openly take the money out. As long as the unscrupulous merchant said this sentence, and the grafter nodded, he could seize the grafter's weakness without paying a cent. Then, the department head was like a department head under the manager, and the section chief was also like a section chief under the manager, holding their pigtails, pulling them wherever he wanted. They called this method "pigs not leaving the pen." From then on, they could steal large amounts of state funds and endlessly profiteer. They could "be well-informed" and decide to purchase 500,000 dog skins one day, and then raise the price the next day; they could substitute bad for good during inspection, selling those bad skins with no fur as good skins to the state… If the grafter whose weakness he had seized failed to "act according to regulations" for a time, the manager would give him a look and say in a drawn-out voice: "Comrade, we're family, take care of each other!" Then the grafter, with a guilty conscience, would break out in a cold sweat and immediately obey orders. The wealth created by the motherland and the people with blood and sweat was thus robbed by the tens of billions.

Did you think that after the anti-corruption campaign, this robber manager would lay down his butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot? Not only did he not, but he came up with even more sinister and insidious schemes. Not only did he run around everywhere to establish "alliances of mutual defense," but he also wanted to borrow a knife to kill someone. He wanted a grafter to push all the blame onto his wife, wanting to make the superiors believe that it was all because the grafter's wife loved to enjoy life and asked him, the manager, for money, that the matter occurred. In this way, he wanted to use a woman who came from the countryside and was not sufficiently awakened as their scapegoat, as the sacrifice for their crimes. What a vicious heart! If anyone had been moved, even for a moment, by his weeping and wailing and kneeling in supplication at the beginning, then they can now understand that his "crying" and "kneeling" were more developed conspiracies than before, a more malicious attack!

A skinny shareholder greeted us with a look of "wholehearted support and welcome." He would say, "You've come at the perfect time. You're here to educate us and cure our illnesses. I've been waiting for you for a long time, hee hee, cough cough!" Every sentence was followed by a few squeezed-out sly laughs. When we asked him questions, he would always say very skillfully, "We don't understand the government's policies yet. Confess and be lenient, the heavily guilty will be given lighter sentences, and the lightly guilty will be exempted from punishment…" If you didn't interrupt him, he could recite the policies for half a day in one breath, from resisting America and aiding Korea to the anti-corruption movement. But when asked about specific issues, he would "hee hee" laugh: "Look, if I had something, would I need you to mobilize me? Not only would I take the lead in confessing, but if I knew they had done something illegal, I would have taken the lead in reporting it, I guarantee there are no problems, hee hee!"

Some people had suspected: "Maybe there really is such a shareholder who is specifically in charge of legitimate business, otherwise, why could he be so confident?" But, it was precisely not someone else, it was this person who kept saying he guaranteed there were no problems, who had set up a "secret gambling den" and used embezzled state funds to engage in speculation and profiteering, tax evasion; it was not someone else, it was this person who kept saying he wanted to resist America and aid Korea, who added water and dirt when purchasing fur for the volunteers, so that "our most beloved people" could not wear the warmest leather shoes on the bitterly cold Korean battlefield; it was not someone else, it was this person who would open his mouth to say he wanted to report others, who firmly advocated at the meeting to establish an alliance of mutual defense: except for using some trivial matters to perfunctorily deal with it, resolutely do not utter a word, resist to the end.

When we examined and the evidence was conclusive and indisputable, he still said in a serious manner: "Oh dear, I don't even know a little bit about it, they sold me out…"

Another one was a shareholder who also managed the accounts. We clearly remembered that on the first day we arrived, we saw that he was a shrewd person, his eyeballs rolling around. But, from some time onwards, he became half-baked, his hat pressed tightly on his eyebrows, his sideburns unshaven for days, his bleary eyes, as if he hadn't woken up for days. When we spoke, he would shake his head and sway his body, striking the pose of an old-fashioned scholar reciting articles. When asked about the suspicious false accounts in his books, he would lean back and forth, saying: "I'm guilty, my guilt is that I have a bad memory, I can't say it in detail…" When asked further, he would say: "Think, let me think…"

The result of the investigation was that this "muddle-headed person" was actually a "specialist" in forging accounts. He could make a book of accounts that was true within the false, and false within the true; he could add many false accounts, report peddlers as merchants, evading taxes; he could make the bribery payments clever and secretive. This was a "talent" specially hired by the fat manager from afar. Would you say he had a bad memory, or a good memory?

There was also a shareholder—an expert in colluding with cadres. When asked questions, he would suddenly have a serious illness descend from the sky, moaning and groaning, saying: "I have no idea what's going on, I can't do it anymore…" Speaking, he really looked like he was on the verge of death; but this "patient," when our comrades were not paying attention for a moment, he broke a hole in the window, saw that there was no one in the courtyard, and sneaked out suspiciously. Our comrades asked him what he was doing, he couldn't explain, what kind of "illness" do you say this is?

This is just one of many "tiger's dens" that have harmed the country and the people, and it is just a few rough examples of the "performances" of several shareholders in one "tiger's den," but we can see from behind these bizarre and despicable tricks that they have a common goal, which is to continue to deny their crimes, continue to do evil, and harm the people.

The tricks of unscrupulous merchants are all carried out under the guise of a magnificent golden signboard. On their walls, there are patriotic conventions written in large regular script: "...Respond to the government's call, actively support the movement to resist America and aid Korea..." Under the glass panel, written in artistic lettering: "No bribery, no tax evasion, no stealing state property, no cutting corners, no stealing state economic intelligence" and other "five no's conventions." In fact, removing these five "no" characters—bribery, tax evasion, stealing state property, cutting corners, stealing state economic intelligence—is precisely the true face of the unscrupulous merchants; the slogans and slogans written in large regular script are just "hiding silver thirty taels here."

Unscrupulous merchants are robbers with human faces and animal hearts, with benevolence and morality on their lips, and male prostitutes and female thieves in their bellies. Don't look at them crying, there is poison in their tears; don't look at them smiling, there are knives hidden in their smiles. You thought they came to submit "confessions," but in fact they are taking the initiative to fight you. In the face of this group of ugly things, you can't look at them with the eyes of ordinary people, you must be vigilant, big and small things have conspiracies. For three years, they have launched a rampant attack on us, and today they have been beaten to pieces under our raging counterattack, but as long as there is a gap, dark guns, cold arrows, devils turned into beauties, the ghost tricks of tigers wearing human skins, they are still playing them all day long. "Sun Wukong has seventy-two transformations, but he can't escape the palm of the Buddha," the unscrupulous merchants are self-righteous, they don't know that no matter how many changes you make, you can't change out of the people's palm, if you are one foot tall as a devil, the people are ten feet tall as righteousness, in fact, the fat manager who cried so "pitifully" and the skinny shareholder who was full of policies have already fallen into the people's net. If there are still unscrupulous merchants who refuse to honestly confess their crimes to the people, then wait for the people to resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate this group of ugly things from our solemn and beautiful land!

    最丑恶的东西
    陈淼
    在“打虎”前线上，深深地感到：奸商，这是世界上一种最丑恶的东西。
    不管什么时候想起来，都会令人作呕，激起一种对它仇恨的感情。
    我们——一个“打虎”的战斗小组，在“虎窝”——一个皮毛货栈里作战的时候，我们看到了奸商们的花样翻新的阴谋伎俩，千奇百怪的丑恶嘴脸。
    一个胖得快要走不动的经理，一问到他违法的事实时，他便哭丧着脸，挤鼻弄眼，抓耳挠腮，故作焦急的样子。嘴里念念有词地说：“有了，我坦白——没有，您叫我说什么，这不是叫我为难吗？”急得要哭，好像他蒙了“不白之冤”。随后，我们用道理开导他，问他还想不想做一个正当的商人，在社会上活下去；用他的切身利益规劝他，希望他为了自己的妻子儿女，挑一条活路走。于是这个经理呜呜地哭起来了，鼻涕一把，泪一把，说他家里还有七十岁的老母瘫在炕上……抽噎唏嘘，混身的胖肉都打哆嗦了，哭得好不伤心啊，倒真像个“可怜虫”了。我们再继续问他的时候，他竟像一摊稀泥似的，跪在尘埃，苦苦哀求，说他真的没有问题了。
    我们真有个别的善良而天真的青年学生被他迷惑了：“这回打动了他的心，也许真的没有问题了吧？”但是，当我们接到有关机关的检举材料的时候，当我们坚定不移地穷追的结果，发现大批触目惊心的罪恶事实的时候，纯洁得像一张白纸似的青年学生，也激起了仇恨的怒火。
    不是别人，正是这个痛哭流涕的经理，一手腐蚀了我们十八个干部，他成了“虎窝”的首领。他有一条长线，一面大网，近自北京、天津，西到太原，北到黑龙江，都有坠入他的圈套的。他有一套狠毒的“战术”，始则吸烟，喝茶，看戏，吃饭，直到：“你们供给制干部，生活清苦，弟兄借你们钱花”塞上一把票子；再则：“××同志，我给你两个英雄股，一股一千万，以后赚了钱大伙花啊！”这样就拉干部入了“英雄股”。他明知道他们不敢显山露水地把钱领出去，这样，奸商只要说这么一句话，贪污分子只要一点头，他便可以不出分文，抓住贪污分子的小辫儿，于是处长就像经理属下的处长，科长也像经理手下的科长，纠着小辫儿，爱往那拽就往那拽，他们管这种方法叫作“猪儿不出圈”。从此，他们便可以大量地盗窃国家的资金，无休止地打滚；他们可以“消息灵通”地头一天决定收购五十万张狗皮，第二天便涨价；他们可以在验货的时候，以坏代好，把那些没毛没板的坏皮子当成好皮子卖给国家……如果那个被他抓住小辫儿的贪污分子，一时未能“照章”办事，经理给他个脸色看，念长声地说：“同志啊，自家人，关照着点儿啊！”于是贪污分子做贼心虚，一身冷汗，连忙唯命是从。祖国和人民用血和汗创造出来的财富，就这样十几个亿地被抢劫去了。
    你以为反贪污以后，这个强盗经理，会放下屠刀，立地成佛了吗？不但没有，而且他想出了更加毒辣、阴险的计策。他不仅到处奔走订立“攻守同盟”，而且他想借刀杀人。他要一个贪污分子将全部罪过都推到妻子身上，想让上级相信：都是因为贪污分子的老婆爱享受，向他这位经理要了钱，事情才发生的。就这样，他想拿一位从农村出来、觉悟不够高的妇女给他们垫背，做他们罪恶的牺牲品。多么恶狠的心哪！如果有人看到他开始时痛哭流涕，下跪哀求而产生过一分一毫的动摇的话，那么现在就可以明白，他的“哭”和“跪”是比以前更加发展了的阴谋诡计，是一种更恶毒的进攻！
    一个瘦骨嶙峋的股东，见面就向我们表示“竭诚拥护，无任欢迎”的样子。开口就说：“诸位来得太好了。诸位是来教育我们，给我们治病来的。我等了你们好久了，嘻嘻，咳咳！”每句话后头都带着几声挤出来的奸笑。当我们向他提出问题的时候，他总是非常熟练地说：“政府的政策咱还不了解，坦白了宽大，重者减轻，轻者免罪……”如果你不打断他的话，他可以一口气给你背诵半天政策，从抗美援朝讲到反贪污运动。但是，问到他具体问题时，他又“嘻嘻”一笑：“您看，我有了还用您动员，不但我要带头坦白啊，我要知道他们做了违法的事，我早带头检举了，保证没有问题，嘻嘻！”
    也曾有人怀疑过：“也许真有这么一个股东，是专门掌管正当营业部分的，不然，为什么他能这样理直气壮呢？”但是，恰恰不是别人，正是这个张口闭口说保证没有问题的人，开设了“暗庄”，把盗用来的国家资金，进行投机倒把，偷税、漏税；不是别人，就是这个口口声声说要抗美援朝的人，在为志愿军收购皮毛时，掺水掺土，使得“我们最可爱的人”在严寒刺骨的朝鲜战场上穿不到最暖的皮鞋；不是别人，就是这个动嘴就说要检举别人的人，在订立攻守同盟的会上，坚决主张：除了用些鸡毛蒜皮的小事来搪塞一下以外，坚决不吐一字，顽抗到底。
    当我们检查得证据确凿，无可争辩的时候，他还像煞有介事地说：“唉呀，我连一点影都不知道，这是他们把我卖了……”
    另一个是股东兼管账，我们明明记得，刚来那天，看见他是个精明的人，两个眼珠骨碌碌直打滚。可是，不知从什么时候起，他变成半吊子了，帽子紧紧地压在眉头上，连鬓胡子几天没有刮，迷登登的眼睛，好像几天没有睡醒，我们一讲话，他便摇头幌脑地做出老夫子念文章的姿态。一问到他账上可疑的假户头时，他便前仰后合地说：“我有罪，我的罪过就是忘性大，说不详细……”再一问便是：“想一想，让我想一想……”
    检查的结果，就是这个“糊涂人”却是造假账的“专家”。他能把一本账弄得真中有假，假中有真；他会按上很多假户头，把座商报成行商，偷漏税款；他可以把行贿的款项，出得巧妙而隐秘。这是那个胖经理从远方特聘来的“人材”，你说他是记性坏，还是记性好呢？
    还有一个股东——勾结干部的能手，问他话的时候，他突然大病从天而降，哼哼呀呀地说：“我心里没有一点底了，不行了……”说着真像命在旦夕的样子；可是这个“病人”，当我们同志一时不注意的时候，他把窗户扎破个窟窿，见院子没有人，鬼鬼祟祟地钻出来，我们的同志问他干什么，他讲不清楚，你说他这是什么“病”呢？
    这不过是多少个陷害国家和人民的“虎窝”中的
    一个，也不过是一个“虎窝”中，几个股东所“表演”的几个粗略的举例，但是我们可以从这些无奇不有的卑鄙的花招后面看出：他们有一个共同的目标，那就是要继续抵赖他们的罪行，继续为非做歹，陷害人民。
    奸商的鬼把戏没有一个不是在冠冕堂皇的金字招牌下进行的。在他们的墙上，有楷书大写的爱国公约：“……响应政府号召，积极支援抗美援朝运动……”玻璃板底下用美术字写着：“不行贿，不偷税，不盗取国家资财，不偷工减料，不盗窃国家经济情报”等“五不公约”。其实，把这五个“不”字去掉——行贿，偷税漏税，盗骗国家资财，偷工减料，盗窃国家经济情报，正是奸商真正的面目；楷书大写的标语口号只不过是“此地无银三十两”而已。
    奸商是人面兽心的强盗，嘴里仁义道德，肚里男盗女娼。不要看他们哭，泪里有毒；不要看他们笑，笑里藏刀。你以为进门来是递“坦白书”了，其实他是向你打主动仗。在这群丑恶的东西面前，不能以对待普通人的眼光来看他们，要警惕，大小事都有阴谋。三年来他们向我们举行了猖狂的进攻，今天在我们如火如荼的反击下被打得落花流水，但是，只要一有空隙，暗枪、冷箭、魔鬼变成了美女，老虎披上了人皮的鬼把戏，他们还是一天到晚在耍着。“孙猴子七十二变，逃不出如来佛的手掌心”，奸商们自作聪明，他不知道任你千变万变，变不出人民的手掌心，你魔高一尺，人民的道高一丈，事实上那个哭得怪“可怜”的胖经理，和那个满口政策的瘦股东已经落入人民的法网。如果还有不肯老老实实向人民认罪的奸商，那就等着人民把你们这群丑恶的东西，从我们庄严美丽的国土上坚决、彻底，全部、干净地肃清吧！
