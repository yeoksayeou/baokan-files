Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 31st. At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 31st, both sides temporarily set aside their differences on issues such as the quota for the rotation of military personnel and discussed the specific details regarding the composition, powers, and duties of the Military Armistice Commission.

    At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative pointed out that the other side's proposal to use the 38th parallel as a standard to distinguish between repatriated civilians was incorrect. For some civilians, this approach would not reunite them with their relatives in their hometowns but would instead force them to leave their homes. Regarding the repatriation of civilians, we have fully agreed to assist them in returning to their hometowns after the armistice and have agreed to include this principle in the terms of the armistice agreement. Therefore, as long as this principle is followed, there are no difficult problems to solve. The other side, however, wants to attach conditions to the repatriation of civilians, thus complicating the issue. The other side has claimed to be "concerned" about this. Our representative pointed out that once the principle is established, as long as the other side handles this issue as seriously as we do, they have no need to be "concerned" at all.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程  
    参谋会议继续举行
    【新华社开城三十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议三十一日的会上，双方暂时搁置了在军事人员轮换限额等问题上的分歧，讨论了有关军事停战委员会的组成、权力与职司的具体细节。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表指出对方提案中以三八线为准，来区分遣返平民的办法是不对的。这种提法对于某一部分平民而言，将不是使他们返乡与其亲友团聚，而是变成背井离乡。关于平民遣返问题，我方已完全同意在停战后协助他们还乡，并同意将这个原则列入停战协定条款之中。因此，只须依照这样的原则办理，并没有什么难于解决的问题。对方却要对平民的返乡附加条件，以致把问题复杂化了。对方曾自称对此表示“担忧”，我方代表指出，一俟原则确定以后，只要对方同我方一样的认真处理这个问题，他们是丝毫没有“担忧”的必要的。
