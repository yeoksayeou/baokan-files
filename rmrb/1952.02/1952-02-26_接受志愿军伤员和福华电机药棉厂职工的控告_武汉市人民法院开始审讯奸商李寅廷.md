Accepting Accusations from Volunteer Army Wounded and Employees of Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory
Wuhan People's Court Begins Trial of Profiteer Li Yinting

On February 20th, representatives of Volunteer Army wounded and families of Volunteer Army soldiers recuperating in Wuhan, as well as employees of the Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory, collectively accused Li Yinting, manager of the Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory, a profiteer who harmed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to the Wuhan People's Court. Zhang Xuetao, President of the Wuhan People's Court, accepted the representatives' accusations and personally interrogated this traitor of the motherland.

The Volunteer Army wounded representatives brought unused emergency kits and triangular bandages from the Korean front as evidence of their accusations. These "emergency kits" and "triangular bandages" were extremely dirty. Some were covered in black soil, some were mixed with hair, and some were even stained with feces. These dirty "emergency kits" and "triangular bandages" were confirmed by the employee representatives of the Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory as being manufactured by the profiteer Li Yinting. Liu Sanjiu, a worker at the Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory, testified that the cotton used by the profiteer Li Yinting to make emergency kits was all purchased used cotton. He said, "Once, when I was fluffing cotton, I even fluffed out human bones." Rao Kefa, a degreasing worker, and Jiang Yuebo, a technician in the disinfection room, also testified that in order to seize exorbitant profits, Li Yinting once made "emergency kits" from ten thousand catties of waste cotton and two hundred bolts of gauze without bleaching or degreasing them at all. Some batches of dirty cotton were merely soaked in salt and lime; and three thousand pounds of cotton were not disinfected at all. Jiang Yuebo said, "I asked to disinfect the cotton, but Li Yinting glared at me and said, 'It doesn't matter, I'll take responsibility if anyone dies!'" The representatives of the Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory also accused the profiteer Li Yinting of using the false name of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" to force workers to increase their daily work hours from eight to fifteen. Many workers became ill from exhaustion but were still forced to work. He also threatened the workers, saying, "If you don't work overtime, you are sabotaging Resisting America and Aiding Korea."

The Volunteer Army wounded furiously accused Li Yinting of his crimes. Wu Yunzhang, a representative of the Volunteer Army wounded, was originally a young and strong platoon leader. During the Fifth Campaign, he was wounded near his left knee joint in the battle on the south bank of the Han River. After the doctor examined him, he told him that the bone was not injured and that he would recover in just half a month. However, after using the "emergency kit" made by the profiteer Li Yinting, he lost a leg. Wu Yunzhang, leaning on crutches, accused: At that time, I was very happy because I could return to the front line after only half a month of recuperation. Who knew that the next day, after being transferred to the division's recuperation center, the wound became infected. On the third day, it began to ooze pus, and on the fifth day, maggots appeared. After returning to the motherland, X-rays and surgery proved that the bone was not injured, but my leg was swollen thicker than a bucket. Finally, after the doctor extracted and tested the pus, it was proven to be caused by bacterial infection. From then on, my leg was amputated, and I became disabled. Wu Yunzhang angrily pointed at Li Yinting and said, "My leg was not broken by American imperialism, but was harmed by you, a profiteer!"

Nie Zhongyuan, a representative of the Volunteer Army wounded, accused: A comrade-in-arms named Zhang Qingshan, a soldier in the machine gun company, was wounded in his right leg, and the bone was also not injured. However, after applying the "emergency kit" made by the profiteer Li Yinting, his calf swelled up in just a short while, and by two or three o'clock the next morning, it had swollen to his lower abdomen. Afterwards, his whole body became red and swollen, and he died the next day. Another deputy platoon leader named Liang Liuhe was wounded in his left leg while scouting the enemy. The bullet only grazed his skin. However, after applying the "emergency kit" made by the profiteer Li Yinting, the wound festered and maggots appeared before he even reached the hospital, and the bone and flesh separated. After the doctor examined him, he said that bacteria had invaded the bone and he had to have his leg amputated. Liang Liuhe is still recuperating somewhere in Hunan. Zhou Jingui, a representative of the Volunteer Army wounded, accused: A comrade-in-arms named Yang Fengshan only suffered a minor injury to his lower jaw, but due to the application of the profiteer Li Yinting's "emergency kit," bacteria invaded his lungs, and in a few days, his lungs rotted away and he died. Zhou Jingui said, "Many revolutionary heroes and revolutionary martyrs have died like this. The profiteer Li Yinting is our irreconcilable enemy! We demand that the government severely punish this unconscionable profiteer!" Tong Linsheng, a family member of a Volunteer Army soldier, said: I am sixty-one years old this year, and I have two sons fighting against the American aggressors on the Korean front. I often encourage them to work hard to kill the enemy and defend the motherland. They also often write letters thanking the people of the motherland for their concern for them. But the insane profiteer Li Yinting has resorted to such vicious means! He pointed at Li Yinting and said, "Li Yinting, are you even Chinese? You are truly a wolf in sheep's clothing!"

The representatives of the Volunteer Army wounded, the representatives of the families of the Volunteer Army soldiers, and the representatives of the employees of the Fuhua Electric Motor Medicinal Cotton Factory unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish this traitor of the motherland, accomplice of American imperialism, and profiteer Li Yinting, to avenge the Volunteer Army comrades who were maimed or sacrificed by his treachery. Finally, President Zhang Xuetao, on behalf of the People's Government, stated: The People's Government will definitely accept the representatives' opinions and severely punish the illegal profiteer Li Yinting according to the law.

    接受志愿军伤员和福华电机药棉厂职工的控告
    武汉市人民法院开始审讯奸商李寅廷
    在武汉市休养的志愿军伤员和志愿军家属，以及福华电机药棉厂的职工，二月二十日派代表集体向武汉市人民法院控告暗害中国人民志愿军的奸商福华电机药棉厂经理李寅廷。武汉市人民法院张雪涛院长接受代表们的控告，亲自审讯这个祖国的叛徒。
    志愿军伤员代表们把从朝鲜前线带回的未用过的救急包和三角巾作为控告的证据。这些“救急包”和“三角巾”非常肮脏。有的满染黑土，有的加杂发丝，有的甚至沾着粪便。这些肮脏的“救急包”和“三角巾”经福华电机药棉厂的职工代表们对证，确实是奸商李寅廷制造的。福华电机药棉厂工人刘三九证明，奸商李寅廷做救急包的棉花都是收买的旧棉花。他说：“有一次我弹花时就弹出了死人的骨头。”脱脂工人饶可发和消毒室技师江月波也证明，李寅廷为了攫取暴利，曾经把一万斤废棉和二百匹纱布根本没有漂白脱脂就制成了“救急包”。有一批脏棉花仅仅放在咸和石灰里泡一泡；还有三千磅棉花根本没有消毒。江月波说：“我要求把棉花消毒，李寅廷竟瞪着眼睛说：‘没有关系，杀脑壳有我！’”福华电机药棉厂的代表们并控诉奸商李寅廷假“抗美援朝”之名，强迫工人由每日工作八小时增加到十五小时。许多工人累病了还被强迫起来工作。他并威胁工人说：“不加班加点，就是破坏抗美援朝。”
    志愿军伤员无限愤怒地控诉李寅廷的罪行。志愿军伤员代表吴云章，原是一个年青力壮的排长；第五次战役时在汉江南岸的战斗中，左膝关节附近负伤。医生检查后对他说：骨头未伤，只要半个月就可以痊愈。但是，用了奸商李寅廷制的“救急包”，结果却丧失了一条腿。吴云章扶着拐杖控诉说：当时我心里非常高兴，因为只要休养半个月就可以重上前线。谁知第二天转到师部休养所，伤口就化脓。第三天开始淌脓水，第五天就生了蛆。回到祖国后，经过透视和开刀都证明骨头没有伤，但我的腿却肿得比斗还粗，最后经医生抽出脓水化验，证明是由于细菌的传染，从此我的一条腿便被锯断，我就成为残废。吴云章愤怒地指着李寅廷说：“我的腿不是美帝国主义打断的，是被你这个奸商暗害的！”
    志愿军伤员代表聂忠元控诉说：一个叫张青山的战友，是机枪连的战士，右腿负伤，也未伤骨。但敷上奸商李寅廷所做的那号“救急包”后，只一会儿，小腿就发肿，到第二天早晨二、三点钟就肿到小腹，以后便全身红肿，第二天就牺牲了。另一个叫梁六合的副排长，在侦察敌人时，左腿负伤，子弹只擦过一点皮。但敷上奸商李寅廷做的“救急包”后，还没到医院伤口就化脓，生了蛆，骨头和皮肉分离开来。经医生检查说是细菌侵入骨头，只好锯掉腿。直到现在梁六合还在湖南某地休养。志愿军伤员代表周金贵控诉说：一个战友叫杨凤山，只是下腮负了一点轻伤，由于敷了奸商李寅廷的“救急包”，被细菌侵入肺内，不几天就把肺烂掉而牺牲了。周金贵说：“我们有许多革命英雄和革命功臣就这样牺牲了。奸商李寅廷是我们不共戴天的敌人！我们要求政府严惩这个伤天害理的奸商！”志愿军家属僮麟生说：我今年六十一岁了，有两个儿子正在朝鲜前线抗击美国侵略军。我常常鼓励他们要努力杀敌保卫祖国。他们也常常来信感谢祖国人民对他们的关怀。但丧心病狂的奸商李寅廷竟下此毒手！他指着李寅廷说：“李寅廷你是不是个中国人？你真是狼心狗肺的东西！”
    志愿军伤员代表、志愿军家属代表、福华电机药棉厂职工代表一致要求人民政府严厉惩办这个祖国的叛徒、美帝国主义的帮凶、奸商李寅廷，为被暗害而成残废或牺牲的志愿军同志报仇。最后，张雪涛院长代表人民政府表示：人民政府一定接受代表们的意见，依法严厉惩办不法奸商李寅廷。
