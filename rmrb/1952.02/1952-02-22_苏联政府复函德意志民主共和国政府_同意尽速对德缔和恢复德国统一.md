    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 21st: TASS, Moscow, February 21st: Soviet Envoy to Berlin, Mr. Pushkin, on behalf of the Soviet government, delivered a letter from the Soviet government to the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Grotewohl, on February 20th, responding to the German Democratic Republic government's letter of February 13th, requesting the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. The Soviet government's reply is as follows:
    "The Soviet government has received the letter from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France regarding the prompt conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.
    "The Soviet government agrees with the proposition put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic and believes that the situation in which nearly seven years have passed since the end of the war against Germany without a peace treaty being concluded and Germany remains in a state of division is completely abnormal.
    "The Soviet government believes that a peace treaty must be concluded with Germany immediately, with the participation of Germany, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement; the Soviet government is deeply convinced that this is in the interests of all peace-loving people in Europe.
    "In view of the great significance of concluding a peace treaty with Germany for strengthening peace in Europe, the Soviet government is willing to do its utmost to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and restore the unification of Germany.
    "The Soviet government hopes that other countries participating in the implementation of control over Germany will also take the same steps."

    苏联政府复函德意志民主共和国政府
    同意尽速对德缔和恢复德国统一
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联驻柏林外交使团团长普式金奉苏联政府之命于二月二十日将苏联政府的公函一件递交德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥，答复德意志民主共和国政府在二月十三日要求苏、美、英、法四国政府尽速缔结对德和约的公函。苏联政府的复函如下：
    “苏联政府已收到德意志民主共和国政府为迅速缔结对德和约事给苏、美、英、法四国政府的来函。
    “苏联政府同意德意志民主共和国政府所提出的主张，并认为对德战争结束已将近七年而仍然没有与德国缔结和约、德国仍然处于分裂状态的这种情况，完全是不正常的。
    “苏联政府认为：必须按照波茨坦协定，在德国的参加之下，立即与德国缔结和约；苏联政府深信这是符合欧洲所有爱好和平的人民的利益的。
    “鉴于缔结对德和约对于加强欧洲和平有着最伟大的意义，苏联政府愿尽其所能加速缔结对德和约，并恢复德国的统一。
    “苏联政府希望其他参加实行对德管制的国家，也采取相同的步骤。”
