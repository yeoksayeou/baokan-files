Xinhua News Agency, 19th: To promote drought prevention and disaster relief work and to ensure the spring sowing in the North China region this year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a production and disaster relief conference in Beijing from February 4th to 7th. The main purpose of this conference was to solve the specific problems and difficulties encountered in the current production and disaster relief work in North China and to determine the principles, tasks, and specific steps for spring disaster relief work. The responsible cadres of the production and disaster relief committees of the five provinces in North China and many responsible cadres of the North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Zhang Su, Deputy Director of the North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government, specifically analyzed the situation where spring production is becoming increasingly busy, non-agricultural income is bound to decrease, and the disaster situation will worsen. He pointed out: Currently, it is the most difficult period for production and disaster relief work in the North China region. All regions should not be complacent or slack in the slightest, and must immediately organize forces, strengthen leadership, and do a good job in production and disaster relief, drought prevention and resistance, and spring farming preparation. He said: According to the decision of the Central People's Government's State Council on vigorously launching a mass drought prevention and resistance campaign, each province should be headed by a vice-chairman or deputy director of the Finance Committee, and 30 to 40 strong cadres should be transferred to form a disaster relief office; the special districts should be led by a deputy commissioner with 20 to 30 people, and the county level should be headed by a deputy county magistrate, with half of the cadres transferred, to specifically carry out disaster relief, drought prevention, and spring farming work. All regions must, according to the earliness or lateness of seasonal changes, select a month between the second half of February and the end of April to conduct a surprise inspection of production and disaster relief work. District and village cadres should use all their strength to lead production and disaster relief, drought prevention, and spring farming work, and the work of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement should be carried out after the spring sowing. However, in production and disaster relief, cadres who embezzle disaster relief grain and funds should be severely punished according to law; cadres who treat disaster relief work with bureaucracy must also be severely dealt with.

Zhang Su particularly pointed out: As spring farming is approaching, all regions should seize the time, continue to use the method of providing work as a form of relief, vigorously develop water conservancy projects, and universally carry out mass small-scale water conservancy work such as well digging and spring excavation. All regions should conscientiously promote the experience of drought resistance over the years, quickly prepare all tools for drought resistance and sowing, and ensure that sowing is done on time when it rains, taking advantage of soil moisture when there is light rain, and drought-resistant sowing when there is no rain, and even cultivating seedlings and transplanting them, striving not to miss the farming season. Zhang Su also said: According to the instructions of the Central Government, old revolutionary base areas, regardless of the severity of the disaster, must ensure that agricultural production maintains the local normal production level. Where possible, efforts should also be made to improve it. All levels of people's governments should use disaster relief grain and funds to effectively help farmers in old areas and disaster areas solve the difficulties of insufficient draught animals, farm tools, fertilizers, and seeds. Local economic departments must guarantee the supply and marketing needs of the old areas and disaster victims, and special attention should be paid to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.

In order to ensure the realization of this arduous task, Zhang Su required all regions to overcome conservative ideas. After disaster relief grain and funds are promptly distributed to the disaster victims, they should focus on spring farming and vigorously organize the masses in the disaster areas to continue to develop diversified sideline production and change the content of production in a timely manner according to seasonal changes to increase income. Disaster relief grain must be quickly transported to various mobile locations to ensure timely relief to the disaster victims.

At the meeting, Li Zheren, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, also gave important instructions. He pointed out that doing a good job in production and disaster relief has a decisive significance for this year's agricultural bumper harvest. All regions should start early and use the grain and loans to be distributed for spring farming, spring sowing, drought prevention, and drought resistance work, so as to fully exert the material strength. He demanded that all regions resolutely eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in production and disaster relief work. All regions should promptly check the distribution, use, and warehouse storage of disaster relief grain and funds; and promptly deal with theft and loss incidents. Finally, he hoped that all regions would concentrate their firepower, overcome all difficulties on the spot, and do their best to do a good job in production and disaster relief in the North China region.

    中共中央华北局财委召开生产救灾会议
    推进华北区防旱救灾和春耕工作
    【新华社十九日讯】为推进防旱工作和救灾工作，保证华北全区今年的春耕播种，中共中央华北局财政经济工作委员会曾在二月四日到七日在北京召开生产救灾会议。这次会议的主要目的在于解决华北当前生产救灾工作中发生的具体问题和困难，决定春季救灾工作的方针、任务和具体步骤。出席会议的有华北五省生产救灾委员会的负责干部，和中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会的负责干部多人。
    会上，中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会副主任张苏具体分析了春季生产日渐繁忙，副业收入势将减少，灾情将会加重的情况后，指出：目前是华北地区生产救灾工作最困难的时期，各地不应丝毫自满和松劲，必须立即组织力量、加强领导，作好生产救灾、防旱抗旱和春耕准备工作。他说：根据中央人民政府政务院关于大力开展群众性防旱、抗旱运动的决定，各省应由省副主席或财委副主任负责，抽调三、四十个较强干部组成救灾办公室；专区应以副专员为首组织二、三十人，县级由副县长负责，抽调一半干部，专门进行救灾防旱和春耕工作。各地均须根据季节变化的早晚，在二月半到四月底，选择一个月时间，对生产救灾工作进行一次突击检查。区、村干部要以全部力量领导生产救灾、防旱和春耕工作，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的工作放在春耕播种以后进行。但在生产救灾中，对于贪污救灾粮款的干部应依法严办；对于用官僚主义对待救灾工作的干部，也必须从严处理。
    张苏特别指出：春耕即到，各地应抓紧时间，继续用以工代赈的办法，大力兴办水利事业，并普遍开展群众性的打井、挖泉等小型水利工作，各地应认真推广历年抗旱的经验，迅速准备好一切抗旱下种的工具，保证作到有雨按时下种，小雨趁墒、借墒抢种，没雨抗旱播种，以至培秧移种，力争不误农时。张苏又说：根据中央的指示，老根据地不分轻重灾区，必须在农业生产上保证作到保持当地常年生产水平。在可能条件下，还要争取提高。各地人民政府应用救灾粮款切实地帮助老区和灾区的农民解决耕畜、农具、肥料、种籽不足的困难。各地经济部门要保证满足老区灾民的供销要求，对革命烈士家属和革命军人家属更要注意适当照顾。
    为保证实现这一艰巨任务，张苏要求各地克服保守思想，在赈粮赈款及时发到灾民手里后，应以春耕为中心，大力组织灾区群众继续从多方面发展副业生产，并根据季节变化，及时改变生产内容，以增加收入。救灾粮食必须迅速运到各机动位置上，保证随时接济灾民。
    会上，中共中央华北局财政经济工作委员会副主任李哲人也作了重要指示。他指出搞好生产救灾工作对今年的农业丰产有决定的意义，各地应该及早动手，把准备发放的贷粮、贷款用在春耕春播、防旱、抗旱工作上，以充分发挥物质力量。他要求各地坚决消灭生产救灾工作中的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象。各地要及时检查救灾粮款的发放、使用和仓库保管情形；及时处理偷盗、损耗事件。最后，他希望各地集中火力，就地克服一切困难，以全力作好华北地区的生产救灾工作。
