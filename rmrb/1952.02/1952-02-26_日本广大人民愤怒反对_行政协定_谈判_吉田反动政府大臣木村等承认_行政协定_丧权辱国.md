Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 25th: Ministers of the reactionary Yoshida government admit that the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" currently being negotiated in Tokyo is a traitorous treaty that humiliates and harms Japan.

Kimura Tokutaro, Director of the Legal Affairs Agency, revealed in response to a question in the Upper House on the 20th that the Japanese government has agreed to grant extraterritoriality to the US military stationed in Japan. In his response, Kimura stated that the "principles" agreed to by the Japanese government regarding the judicial power issue in the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" are: (1) "The US military will have the right to investigate and try criminal cases involving US military or civilian personnel within US military zones"; (2) Even if the crime occurs outside the US military zone, "the Americans involved" will still "be tried by the US military"; (3) Even in "Japanese criminal cases," as long as they occur within the US military zone, "the US military can conduct investigations and arrests." These "principles" are the specific content of the extraterritorial rights that the United States will continue to enjoy in Japan. Okazaki Katsuo, the State Minister representing the Japanese side in the "Administrative Agreement" negotiations, revealed in his speech in the Diet that the "Administrative Agreement" also undermines Japan's tax sovereignty, in addition to admitting the fact that the United States will continue to enjoy extraterritorial rights in Japan. He told the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 22nd that goods purchased with funds from the US budget are not taxed in Japan; goods purchased or prepaid by the United States using Japan's de facto occupation fee—"defense burden sharing"—are also not taxed.

The "Administrative Agreement" negotiations have aroused increasingly angry opposition from the Japanese people. A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 21st admitted: "Here in Japan, complaints have risen against the plan for US troops to be stationed in Japan after the conclusion of the peace treaty" because the US military stationed in Japan will enjoy "certain extraterritorial rights." The widely circulated bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" has even "warned the Yoshida government not to give up extraterritorial rights." Some bourgeois elements are already worried that the secret "Administrative Agreement" negotiations will lead Japan down the path of enslavement and destruction. This anxiety is reflected in: "Most newspaper commentaries express concern that conducting negotiations in secret without making the issue public will affect Japan's future status."

    日本广大人民愤怒反对“行政协定”谈判
    吉田反动政府大臣木村等承认“行政协定”丧权辱国
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：吉田反动政府的大臣们承认正在东京谈判的美日“行政协定”对日本说来是一个丧权辱国的卖国条约。
    法务府总裁木村笃太郎二十日在参院答复质询时透露，日本政府已经同意给予驻日美军以治外法权。木村在答辩时称，对于美日“行政协定”中的司法权问题，日本政府所同意的“原则”是：（一）“美军将有权调查及审判美军驻区以内涉及美军军职或文职人员的犯罪案件”；（二）即使罪案发生在美军驻区以外，“涉及的美国人”仍然“须交由美军审判”；（三）甚至“日本刑事案件”，只要是发生在美军驻区以内，“美军可从事调查及拘捕”。这些“原则”正是美国将在日本继续享有的治外法权的具体内容。 “行政协定”谈判的日方代表国务相冈崎胜男在国会中的谈话，除了承认美国将在日本继续享有治外法权的事实外，并透露了“行政协定”也破坏了日本的税收主权。他在二十二日对众院预算委员会说：以美国预算中的经费购买物品，在日本不课税；美国利用日本供给的变相占领费——“分担防卫费”——购买或垫付的物品，也不课税。
    “行政协定”的谈判已激起日本人民愈来愈愤怒的反对。路透社东京二十一日电承认：由于驻日美军将享有“某些治外法权”，“此间日本人抱怨美国在和约缔结之后驻兵日本计划的情绪已高涨”。销路很广的资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”都已在“警告吉田首相政府不得让出治外法权”。一部分资产阶级已在担忧正在秘密进行的“行政协定”谈判将使日本走上被奴役和毁灭的道路。这种焦虑的情绪反映在：“大多数报纸评论都表示忧虑，认为不把问题公诸舆论而秘密地进行谈判，会影响日本未来的地位。”
