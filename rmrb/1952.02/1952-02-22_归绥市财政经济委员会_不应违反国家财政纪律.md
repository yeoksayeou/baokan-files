    The GuiSui City Finance and Economics Committee
    Should Not Violate National Financial Discipline

    To the Editor: The GuiSui City Finance and Economics Committee in Suiyuan Province is violating national financial discipline by withholding funds that should be turned over to the treasury and engaging in large-scale production, causing significant losses to the people's property.

    In 1951, GuiSui City confiscated over 1 billion yuan in assets from the leaders of the Yiguandao [a banned religious sect]. These funds should have been entirely handed over to the treasury, but the City Finance and Economics Committee used all of it for local production and allocated some for use by the public security and judicial departments. Furthermore, the publicly owned XinSui Flour Mill's profit income last year was approximately 100 million yuan, but the City Finance and Economics Committee actually spent it under the pretext of "solving practical problems." At the beginning of last year, the City Finance and Economics Committee used 200 million yuan in production funds allocated to GuiSui City by Suiyuan Province and 150 million yuan extracted from the Finance Bureau to establish a Heping (Peace) Gunny Sack Factory, directly managed by the City Finance and Economics Committee. However, due to their serious bureaucratic style, the factory went bankrupt in November. The government suffered significant political and economic losses.

    Because the City Finance and Economics Committee directly manages finances, various city-level units often directly approach the City Finance and Economics Committee to resolve issues related to financial expenditures. The responsible comrades of the City Finance and Economics Committee do not carefully review matters according to regulations and approve them arbitrarily. The City Finance and Economics Committee itself spends several million yuan each month on "entertainment expenses."

    The GuiSui City Finance and Economics Committee's serious violations of financial discipline cannot be tolerated. It is hoped that the committee will immediately conduct a self-examination and correct these errors.

### 归绥市财政经济委员会  不应违反国家财政纪律

    归绥市财政经济委员会
    不应违反国家财政纪律
    编辑同志：绥远省归绥市财政经济委员会违反国家财政纪律，扣留解库款项，大搞生产，使人民财产遭受到很大损失。
    一九五一年，归绥市没收一贯道首的财产，共达十亿多元。这些款本来应该完全上解入库，但市财政经济委员会却全部用来搞地方生产，和留给公安、司法部门支用。又公营新绥面粉厂去年的利润收入约一亿元，市财政经济委员会竟藉口“解决实际问题”开支了。去年年初，市财政经济委员会用绥远省拨给归绥市的生产基金两亿元和向财政局提取的一亿五千万元，开办了一个和平麻袋厂，由市财政经济委员会直接管理，但由于他们有严重的官僚主义作风，结果这个厂在十一月间就倒闭了。政府在政治上、经济上遭受到很大损失。
    由于市财政经济委员会直接管理财务，市属各单位遇到有关财政开支的问题，往往直接找市财政经济委员会去解决；而市财政经济委员会的负责同志也不按制度详细审核，就胡乱批准。市财政经济委员会本身，每月要花销“招待费”几百万元。
    归绥市财政经济委员会这种严重违反财政纪律的错误，是不能容许的，希望该会立即检查纠正。
