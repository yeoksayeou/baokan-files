How We Carried Out Agricultural Technology Promotion Work
　　Shandong Province Wendeng County Farm
　　Our farm was established in 1945 and has been in existence for seven years. It has a director, two administrative cadres, three technical promotion cadres, and five workers. It cultivates 100 mu of land, using horse-drawn plows and ordinary farm tools. From the perspective of manpower and material resources, this farm is very small. However, because it has received correct leadership from the county people's government over the years and has paid attention to leveraging the role of labor models as a bridge, it has established a complete agricultural technology promotion network in the county, which has played a significant role in increasing agricultural production throughout the county. In 1950, this farm was recognized as a model farm by the East China Agricultural Department.

　　Establishing and Developing a Promotion Network
　　In 1946, the Wendeng County Farm's agricultural guidance center began to promote agricultural technology through labor models. It regularly sent people to contact labor models with prestige in the nearby Gao Village, Tianfu Mountain, and Zou Mountain areas, and absorbed them as demonstration households to disseminate agricultural technology and learn from their experiences.

　　In 1947, the agricultural guidance center was closed, and the county farm's organization was reduced in size, making it impossible to conduct on-site guidance. Therefore, the approach was changed, inviting labor models from nearby Fugui Village, Sunjiabu, and other six villages to form an agricultural technology research association (hereinafter referred to as the "research association") in Gao Village (where the farm is located). Labor model Zhang Fugui and the farm director served as chairman and vice chairman, respectively, and other labor models served as members. They met at the farm every half month to exchange experiences and study production methods (each time focusing on one or two issues, keeping the meetings short to avoid delaying production). They also invited labor models to the farm to visit according to the seasons to promote scientific knowledge with examples and absorb the practical experience of labor models to improve and enrich the farm's various tasks. Because the research association solved many production problems, it gained the support of labor models; labor models from other districts also requested to participate. By 1948, four research associations had been established successively, centered around market towns, absorbing 23 labor models to participate. The farm regularly sent people to participate in the research association meetings to provide guidance and disseminate the experiences of each research association. However, due to insufficient integration with the county and district governments, only individual guidance could be provided, lacking overall planning and promotion.

　　At this time, the county people's government saw the significant role played by the research association and began to pay attention to the farm's technology promotion work. In the winter of 1949, the original research associations were renamed promotion stations, each station responsible for technical guidance in two to four districts. District research associations were generally established in each district, composed of seven to nine labor models and activists, selecting a labor model with prestige as the director and the district head as the deputy director. The director of the research association and the district production assistant attended meetings at the promotion station on a regular basis. Farm cadres often focused on several research associations in the district where the farm was located and nearby districts as a base to provide specific guidance and create experiences; they also participated in meetings at each promotion station with the construction department cadres according to the seasons to convey the government's intentions and absorb the experience of labor models. By 1950, five promotion stations had been established in the county (the farm controlled three, and the construction department controlled two); research associations had been established in all fifteen districts (the farm controlled eight, and the construction department controlled seven), with a total of 121 labor models participating in the research associations.

　　In 1951, the county's agricultural and forestry technology promotion committee was established, with the county head serving as the chairman, and representatives from the CCP Wendeng County Committee's peasant committee, youth committee, women's committee, agricultural and forestry farms, special district farms, the CCP Wendeng County Committee's propaganda department, and the county people's government's construction department participating. Regular meetings were held quarterly, and temporary meetings were held in special circumstances. Under this committee, an experimental area (Gao Village District) was established, with the farm assigning a dedicated person to provide technical guidance, focusing on the technical improvement work of the research association, technical teams, and demonstration households in the experimental area to gain experience to promote throughout the county. At the same time, the promotion stations and district research associations were expanded, and agricultural technology research groups were established in each township, led by the township government, with the district responsible for key management. Technical promotion teams were also established in the villages where the district research association members lived, with five to seven members, with the research association member serving as the team leader, responsible for demonstration promotion, introduction of experience and technology, etc. As of November 7, 1951, all fifteen districts and 155 townships in the county had established 15 district research associations and 146 township research groups, with a total of 174 district research association members and 928 township research group members. Of the 739 villages in the county, village technology promotion teams had been established in 590 villages, with a total of 2,809 team members. Because the farm's promotion personnel were too few, and the demonstration work was only carried out on the farm and in a few demonstration households, it was not easy to achieve greater results. Therefore, in the autumn of 1951, the farm also agreed with the labor models of various districts and townships in the county to establish demonstration farmland separately, cooperating with the farm to carry out key demonstration work.

　　The Role of the Promotion Network in Agricultural Production
　　Based on the specific conditions of local agricultural production and the urgent needs of the masses, the farm first carried out demonstration work in the nursery, and then promoted it to the masses through the promotion network. For example, deep plowing, sand pressing, increased fertilization, planting of superior varieties, winter plowing, weeding, etc., were all first demonstrated by the farm, and then accepted by promotion organizations at all levels before being promoted to the vast number of farmers. The achievements of the past few years are as follows:

　　(1) Promoting Superior Varieties. The farm's trial planting of Flattop wheat yielded an average of 351 jin per mu in the summer of 1946, which was 108 jin more per mu than the most widely planted Red Bald wheat in the local area. In the same year, this superior variety was promoted to labor models, and then successively promoted to the masses; by the autumn of 1951, the planting area of Flattop wheat had expanded to 60% of the county's wheat planting area, with 90% of households planting it. In 1951, White Molar Corn, Victory No. 100 Sweet Potato, Spreading Green Soybean, Kenaf, and Si Zi Wu Ai Cotton were also promoted.

　　(2) Leading the Masses to Accumulate Fertilizer. The farm proposed the "three diligences" slogan of "diligently sweeping the courtyard, diligently padding the pen, and diligently turning the pen" through the research association, and developed a method of making artificial urine fertilizer (fermented urine), which was promoted throughout the county, solving the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer and increasing yields. In addition, the farm's methods of burning mud, accumulating dry ash, fermenting green manure, and accumulating urine have been popularized in every household in the county. Due to the application of urine fertilizer, grain production has increased. For example, labor model Yu Changsong's wheat that was fertilized with urine yielded 56 jin more per mu than wheat that was not; Zhou Zhongfu's Flattop wheat yielded 729 jin per mu due to the application of urine.

　　(3) Promoting Wheat Seed Selection and Disease Prevention Technology. In the wheat seed selection and disease prevention campaign in 1951, the farm cooperated with the construction department to convene an enlarged cadre meeting of township heads and district production assistants in the county to convey the work tasks and explain the seed selection and disease prevention technology. Later, the farm cooperated with Gao Village District and several nearby districts to hold wheat seed selection and disease prevention observation meetings. At these observation meetings, the farm explained the demonstration work of the year. For example, in the demonstration of the prevention and control of wheat bunt, different methods such as "clean seed disease manure" and "disease seed clean manure" were used for regional comparison to explain to the masses that bunt is transmitted due to bacterial spores attached to the manure, or because the seed itself has bacteria attached to it. After this, most of the masses paid attention to and achieved the selection of clean seeds, or hot water soaking, cold water washing, and accumulation of clean manure, using the manure spreading method for planting wheat; many wheat fields that had suffered serious wheat diseases in the past were thus eliminated or reduced. Due to the organization of wheat variety observation and the teaching of seed selection technology to the masses through the promotion network, 31,197 households in the county carried out ear selection in 1951, plus the number of households participating in plot selection and field selection, reaching 76.9% of the county's 87,663 households, selecting a total of 1,171,631 jin of wheat seeds.

　　(4) Promoting Well Drilling. Local farmers generally do not have the habit of drilling wells. The farm used the comparative demonstration of watering and not watering wheat fields and corn fields to make the masses aware of the benefits of well drilling and irrigation, promoting well drilling work in 1950; Gao Village District alone exceeded the original plan by drilling 36 more wells, and a watering campaign was launched during the drought, avoiding drought disasters.

　　(5) Promoting Improved Cultivation Methods. Wheat strip planting, winter sand pressing of wheat seedlings, weeding wheat, planting peanuts with flat ridges and then raising high ridges, sweet potato outdoor warm bed seedling raising, Victory No. 100 sweet potato dense planting without turning vines, soybean and corn intercropping, corn detasseling and hybridization, key use of peanut rhizobium, winter plowing, and soil improvement technologies were promoted.

　　In addition, during the autumn harvest and autumn planting in 1951, the farm, in conjunction with the county construction department, the special district farm, the seed station, and the pest and disease station, held short-term agricultural technology training classes in the fifteen districts of the county, training a total of 5,922 district and township cadres, research association members, youth representatives, women representatives, labor models, activists, mutual aid team leaders, etc., solving urgent problems such as autumn seed selection, prevention and control of wheat diseases, and management of economic crops.

　　Main Reasons for Making Achievements
　　(1) The close combination of the county people's government's construction department and the farm, with the county head and district heads serving as the main leaders of the agricultural technology promotion organization, and the party organization also paying close attention to leading this work, is the main reason why the promotion work can be carried out smoothly. At the same time, all technical improvement work has been assisted and guided by the special district farm; the special district farm has trained a large number of county and district-level cadres to lead production, solving the difficulties of manpower, material resources, and technology in the promotion work.

　　(2) Leveraging the Leading Role of Labor Models and Activists. Technical promotion work is popularized to the general public through the leading and bridging role of labor models and activists. If there is no leading role of labor models, simply establishing a promotion network with administrative power will become formalism and will not be easy to sustain.

　　(3) District research association members, village research group leaders, and farm demonstration households are mostly mutual aid team leaders, and technical promotion work has a broad and organized mass base. Farm staff can also face the masses, educate the masses, and start from the actual needs of the masses, so they can focus on solving the main problems of each period.

　　(4) The special district construction department holds various agricultural technology training classes every production season to train district production assistants. The county people's government also convenes district and township head meetings every season to convey tasks and learn technology, so that the role of the grassroots promotion network is gradually strengthened.

　　(5) Mastering the principle of steady development from small to large and from point to surface, consolidating and developing the organization of the promotion network.

    我们怎样开展了农业技术推广工作
    山东省文登县农场
    我们这个农场是一九四五年建立的，到现在已有七年的历史。现有场长一名，行政干部二名，技术推广干部三名，工人五名。共经营土地一百亩，用马拉犁和普通农具耕种。从人力物力上看，这个农场是很小的。但因为历年来得到县人民政府的正确领导，和注意发挥劳动模范的桥梁作用，已在全县建立了一个完整的农业技术推广网，对全县的农业增产，起了很大作用。一九五○年，这个农场被华东农业部评为农场模范。
    建立和发展推广网
    一九四六年文登县农场的农业指导所开始通过劳动模范推广农业技术，经常派人到附近的高村、天福山、邹山等五个区和有威信的劳动模范联系，吸收他们作为示范户，传播农业技术，并吸取他们的经验。
    一九四七年农业指导所结束，县农场机构缩小，不能再巡回指导，便改变方式，邀集附近的富贵村、孙家埠等六个村的劳动模范，在高村（农场所在地）组成了农业技术研究会（以下简称农研会）以劳动模范张富贵和农场场长为正副主任，其他劳动模范为委员，每半月到农场开会一次，交流经验，研究生产办法（每次研究一两个问题，时间很短，不使耽误生产）；并按季节邀请劳动模范到农场来参观，以实例向劳动模范宣传科学知识，同时吸取劳动模范的实际经验，来改进和充实农场的各项工作。因为农研会解决了许多生产上的问题，获得了劳动模范的拥护；其他区的劳动模范也都要求参加。到一九四八年，以市集为中心，陆续成立了四个农研会，吸收了劳动模范二十三人参加。农场按期派人参加农研会的会议，进行指导，并借此传播各农研会的经验。不过，因为和县区政府结合得不够密切，只能作到个别指导，缺乏全面的布置和推动。
    这时，县人民政府见到农研会所起的作用很大，开始注意农场的技术推广工作。一九四九年冬季，原有的农研会改名推广站，每站负责两个到四个区的技术指导工作。各区普遍成立区农研会，由七个到九个劳动模范和积极分子组成，选一个有威信的劳动模范做主任，区长做副主任。农研会主任、区生产助理员按期到推广站开会。农场干部经常在农场所在区及其附近区掌握几个农研会做基点，进行具体指导，创造经验；并按季节和建设科干部分别到各推广站参加会议，传达政府意图，吸取劳动模范经验。到一九五○年，全县设立推广站五处（农场掌握三个，建设科掌握两个）；十五个区都成立了农研会（农场掌握八个，建设科掌握七个），参加农研会的劳动模范共一百二十一人。
    一九五一年，又成立了全县的农林技术推广委员会，由县长兼主任委员，吸收中共文登县委的农民委员、青年委员、妇女委员和农林场、专区农场、中共文登县委宣传部、县人民政府建设科等部门参加，每季召开例会一次，有特殊情况时临时召开。在这个委员会下设一个实验区（高村区），由农场派专人负责进行技术指导，并重点掌握实验区内的农研会、技术小组和示范户的技术改进工作，以吸取经验推动全县。同时，扩大了各推广站和区农研会，又在各乡成立农业技术研究小组，由乡政府领导，区负责重点掌握。区农研会委员所住村也成立了技术推广小组，组员五到七人，农研会委员为当然组长，负责示范推广、介绍经验和技术等工作。到一九五一年十一月七日为止，全县十五个区一百五十五个乡，已建立区农研会十五处、乡农研组一百四十六处，共有区农研会委员一百七十四人，乡农研组组员九百二十八人。全县七百三十九个村，已建立村技术推广小组的有五百九十村，组员人数已有二千八百零九人。因为农场推广人员过少，而示范工作又只在农场和少数示范户进行，不易收到更大的效果，所以，一九五一年秋，农场又和全县各区、乡的劳动模范们约定，分别建立示范农田，配合农场作重点的示范工作。
    推广网在农业生产上所起的作用
    农场根据当地农业生产的具体情况和群众的迫切需要，先作好圃场示范工作，再经过推广网向群众推广。如深耕、压沙、增施肥料、种植优良品种及冬耕、锄草等，都是农场先作好示范，由各级推广机构接受后，再向广大农民推广的。几年来的成绩有以下几项：
    （一）推广优良品种。农场试种的扁穗小麦，一九四六年夏每亩平均产三百五十一斤，比当地栽植最广的红秃头小麦，每亩多产一百零八斤。当年就把这个良种推广到劳动模范手里，以后又陆续向群众推广；到一九五一年秋季，扁穗小麦的种植面积就扩大到全县种麦面积的百分之六十，种植户数达百分之九十。一九五一年又推广了白马牙玉米、胜利百号甘薯、爬蔓青大豆、洋麻及斯字五爱棉等。
    （二）领导群众积肥。农场通过农研会提出“勤扫院子、勤垫栏、勤翻圈”的三勤口号，并研究出人造尿肥（沤尿）的办法，向全县推广，解决了肥料不足的困难，提高了产量。此外，农场的烧泥、积干灰、沤绿肥、积尿等积肥方法，已普及全县每一农户。由于浇尿肥，粮食产量提高了。如劳动模范于长松浇尿的小麦比不浇的每亩多产五十六斤；周中富因用尿浇麦，每亩扁穗小麦产七百二十九斤。
    （三）推广小麦选种防病技术。在一九五一年开展小麦选种防病运动中，农场配合建设科召开了全县的乡长、区生产助理员扩大干部会议，传达了工作任务，讲解了选种防病技术。以后农场又分别配合高村区和附近几个区举行了选种防病参观会。在这些参观会上，农场把本年的示范工作作了说明。如对小麦腥乌麦的防治示范，就用“净种病粪”、“病种净粪”等不同办法分区对比，向群众说明了腥乌麦是由于病菌胞子附在粪上，或因种子本身附有病菌而传染的。这以后，大部群众都注意了并且作到了选用净种，或温汤浸种、冷水洗种和积净粪，用铺粪办法种麦；许多过去小麦病害严重的麦田因而都消灭或减轻了病害。由于组织小麦品种参观和通过推广网教给群众选种技术，一九五一年全县进行穗选的有三万一千一百九十七户，加上片选和场选的户数，参加了选种工作的达全县八万七千六百六十三户的百分之七十六点九，共选出麦种一百一十七万一千六百三十一斤。
    （四）推动打井工作。当地一般农民没有打井习惯，农场用小麦地、玉茭地浇水和不浇水的对比示范，使群众认识打井浇地的好处，推动了一九五零年的打井工作；只高村区就超过原计划多打了三十六眼，在抗旱时掀起了浇地运动，免除了旱灾。
    （五）推动改进耕作方法。推广了小麦条播，麦苗冬季压沙，锄麦，种花生用平垅再培高垅，甘薯室外温床育苗，胜利百号甘薯密栽不翻蔓，大豆玉茭间作，玉茭去雄杂交，重点使用花生根瘤菌及冬耕、改良土壤等技术。
    此外，在一九五一年秋收、秋种时，农场又结合县建设科、专区农场、种子站、病虫站等，在全县十五个区分别召开了短期农业技术训练班，共训练区乡干部、农研会会员、青年代表、妇女代表、劳动模范、积极分子、互助组长等共五千九百二十二人，解决了大秋选种、防治小麦病害和管理经济作物等迫切问题。
    做出成绩的主要原因
    （一）县人民政府建设科和农场密切结合，县长和区长都做农业技术推广组织的主要负责人，党的组织也密切注意领导这一工作，这是推广工作能顺利开展的主要原因。同时，各项技术改进工作都得到了专区农场的协助和指导；专区农场曾训练了大批县、区级领导生产的干部，解决了推广工作中人力物力和技术的困难。
    （二）发挥了劳动模范和积极分子的带头作用。技术推广工作都是通过劳动模范、积极分子的带头和桥梁作用，普及到一般群众的。假如没有劳动模范的带头作用，单纯地用行政力量建立推广网，就会流于形式主义，不易坚持。
    （三）区农研会委员、村农研组组长、农场示范户，大都是互助组长，技术推广工作有广泛的有组织的群众基础。农场工作人员也都能面向群众，教育群众，从群众的实际需要出发，所以能够集中解决每一个时期的主要问题。
    （四）专署建设科在每一生产季节都举办各种农业技术训练班，训练区生产助理员。县人民政府也在每一个季节，召开区、乡长会议，传达任务，学习技术，使基层推广网的作用逐步加强。
    （五）掌握了由小到大、由点到面稳步发展的原则，巩固和发展了推广网的组织。
