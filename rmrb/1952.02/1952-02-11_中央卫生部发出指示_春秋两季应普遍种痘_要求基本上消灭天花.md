    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Health issued the 1952 Vaccination Instructions. The instructions stated: 1952 is the second year of implementing vaccination. This year, it is planned to vaccinate 260 million people nationwide to ensure that the vast majority of people have immunity to smallpox, in order to basically eliminate smallpox.

    The instructions pointed out: The vaccination work in 1952 will still be carried out in spring and autumn. Each city and county should systematically organize manpower, educate the people being vaccinated on vaccination matters, unify vaccination techniques and working methods, and then allocate work areas to ensure that each area is responsible. If epidemic prevention teams at all levels assist in vaccination in health service blank areas, they must be under the leadership of the administrative authorities in the work area and establish contact with local health organizations or health workers associations (including all health groups, medical workers' joint associations, and Chinese and Western medicine joint associations) to cooperate in their work and avoid wasting manpower.

    The instructions also pointed out: In areas where widespread vaccination has been basically completed, newborns and those who were previously missed should be the vaccination targets. In areas where vaccination has not been widespread in the past, vaccination work should be vigorously promoted, especially attention should be paid to residents in remote areas. Vaccination should be registered to avoid repeated vaccinations and to avoid simply pursuing numbers.

    中央卫生部发出指示
    春秋两季应普遍种痘
    要求基本上消灭天花
    【新华社八日讯】中央人民政府卫生部发出一九五二年种痘指示。指示称：一九五二年是推行种痘的第二个年度，本年预定全国种痘二亿六千万人，以使绝大多数的人民对天花都具有免疫力，以达到基本上消灭天花的目的。
    指示指出：一九五二年种痘工作，仍分春秋两季举行。各市、县要有计划地组织力量，对施种的人要分别给以种痘事项的教育，统一种痘技术与工作方法，然后分配工作地区，作到分区负责。如各级防疫队协助卫生空白地区种痘时，必须受工作地区行政方面的领导，并与当地卫生组织或卫生工作者协会（包括一切卫生团体、医务工作者联合会和中西医联合会等）取得联系，配合工作，避免浪费人力。
    指示并指出：凡是基本上已经完成普遍种痘的地区，应以新生儿和以前漏种的人为种痘对象。以往种痘不普遍的地区就应当大力推行种痘工作，尤其应当注意偏僻地区的居民。种痘要登记，以免重复种痘，并要避免单纯追求数字。
