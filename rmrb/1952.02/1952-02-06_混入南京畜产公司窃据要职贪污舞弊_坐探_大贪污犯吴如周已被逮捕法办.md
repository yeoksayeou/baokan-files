    Wu Ruzhou, the Deputy Manager of the Nanjing Branch of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation and a major embezzler, was an agent of the bourgeoisie planted in the state economic organs. For more than two years, Wu colluded with unscrupulous merchants, stole state economic intelligence, engaged in embezzlement and malpractice, causing serious political and economic losses to the state economic organs.

    Wu Ruzhou was originally a private merchant engaged in the feather export business for thirty years. After liberation, he infiltrated the state enterprise organs, successively serving as the Director of the Nanjing Branch of the public-private joint venture Hezhong Feather Company, the Deputy Director of the Nanjing Office of the state-owned China Feather Company, and the Deputy Manager of the Nanjing Branch of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation. During his tenure, Wu consistently colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Li Chuntian (owner of Nanjing Li Chunji Feather Shop), leaking the state economic intelligence he possessed to Li Chuntian, enabling Li Chuntian to engage in speculative activities. When purchasing feathers from Li Chunji Feather Shop, Wu frequently overestimated the quality and increased the price by about 10%. According to preliminary statistics, the losses to state property caused by the above two acts of embezzlement and malpractice alone exceeded 100 million yuan. During his time at the public-private joint venture Hezhong Feather Company, Wu Ruzhou repeatedly placed orders with Li Chuntian, paid particularly favorable payments, and then stopped purchasing. He then waited for the feather price to fall, allowing Li Chuntian to take the opportunity to purchase and mix in fakes, which were then delivered to the company (Wu Ruzhou's younger brother, Wu Ruding, personally inspected and accepted the goods, facilitating everything). As a result, Li made exorbitant profits of over 100% each time. In just over two years, the unscrupulous merchant Li Chuntian transformed from an ordinary feather vendor into a big merchant. The unscrupulous merchant Li Chuntian frequently entered and exited Wu's office. Wu even had Li Chuntian answer confidential phone calls regarding the Shanghai District Company of the Feather Company's adjustment of purchase prices. Li Chuntian spent 70 million yuan to purchase a house, but did not live in it himself, giving it to Wu Ruzhou to live in. The extent of the collusion between the two can be seen from this.

    In addition, Wu also colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Futang (once a receiving clerk for Hezhong Company), taking out capital and entrusting him to purchase yellow weasel skins, which were then resold to the company, from which Wu secretly extracted exorbitant profits. Wu also masterminded collective embezzlement with Zhang Futang, Wu Ruding, and Geng Guilin (company accountant). The amount currently found is close to 20 million yuan.

    Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Wu Ruzhou initially avoided making self-criticisms, and then, under mass pressure, only talked about some "trivial matters." He refused to make a thorough confession. On January 26th, responsible comrades from the Industry and Commerce Bureau personally "went up the mountain to fight the tiger," leading the company's employees to search the tiger's den. The Industry and Commerce Bureau also convened a forum of merchants in the feather industry, calling on everyone to expose the acts of collusion, embezzlement, and malpractice between the unscrupulous merchant Li Chuntian and Wu Ruzhou. At the same time, 31 company employees were organized into 11 groups to conduct separate interviews with 36 private merchants in the feather industry. After such a close arrangement, internal and external attack, and layer-by-layer encirclement, the final general offensive broke through this fortress. The Nanjing Municipal People's Procuratorate has arrested and brought to justice the major embezzler Wu Ruzhou, who refused to confess, along with his accomplice Wu Ruding, and the unscrupulous merchants Li Chuntian and Zhang Futang.

    混入南京畜产公司窃据要职贪污舞弊
    “坐探”大贪污犯吴如周已被逮捕法办
    中国畜产公司南京支公司副经理、大贪污犯吴如周，是资产阶级派入国家经济机关的一个代理人。两年多来，吴犯和奸商相勾结，盗窃国家经济情报，营私舞弊，使国家经济机关在政治上和经济上都遭受了严重的损失。
    吴如周原是从事羽毛出口业达三十年之久的私商，解放后混入国家企业机关，连续担任公营合众皮毛公司南京分庄主任、国营中国皮毛公司南京办事处副主任、中国畜产公司南京支公司副经理等职。吴犯在任职期间，一贯和奸商李春田（南京李春记皮毛号老板）相勾结，把他所掌握的国家经济情报，都泄漏给李春田，使李春田得以进行投机活动。在收购李春记皮毛号的羽毛时，吴犯经常高估成色，提价在一成左右。仅以上两项贪污舞弊所造成的国家财产的损失，据初步统计已在一亿元以上。吴如周在公营合众皮毛公司时期，曾数次向李春田订货，付给特别优厚的货款，然后停止收购，等羽毛跌价，再让李春田趁机收购，并掺杂做假，交给公司（吴如周的弟弟吴如鼎亲自看货验收，处处予以方便），结果李犯所获暴利每次均在百分之百以上。仅两年多时间，奸商李春田就由一个普通羽毛贩子，变成了大商人。奸商李春田经常出入吴犯办公室，甚至皮毛公司上海区公司调整收购牌价的机密电话，吴犯都可叫李春田代接。李春田花七千万元购买房屋一座，自己不住，给吴如周居住。二人沆瀣一气，狼狈为奸的程度，于此可见。
    此外，吴犯并勾结奸商张福堂（一度为合众公司收货员），拿出资本，托他收购黄狼皮，转卖给公司，从中窃取暴利。吴犯并主谋和张福堂、吴如鼎、耿桂林（公司会计员）集体贪污，现查出的数字已近两千万元。
    自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展以来，吴如周初则避不检讨，继而在群众压力下只谈一些“鸡毛蒜皮”的事情。拒不彻底坦白。一月二十六日，工商局负责同志亲自“上山打虎”，领导该公司职工搜查虎穴。工商局又召集皮毛业商人举行了一次座谈会，号召大家检举奸商李春田和吴如周勾结贪污舞弊的行为。同时，组织公司职工三十一人，分为十一个小组，向皮毛业私商三十六家分头进行访问。经过这样严密布置、内外夹击、层层包围，实行总攻的结果，终将这一堡垒突破。南京市人民检察署，已将拒不坦白的大贪污犯吴如周，同犯吴如鼎，奸商李春田、张福堂逮捕法办。
