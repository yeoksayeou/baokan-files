    American Aggressors Will Surely Eat Their Own Bitter Fruit
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    The American imperialist aggressor troops have actually committed insane and inhumane atrocities in Korea. A dispatch from the New China News Agency's Korean front on the 21st has provided conclusive reports on this. American beast soldiers scattered a large number of small insects from airplanes, containing plague, cholera, and other germs. Preliminary tests have confirmed this.
    From January 28th to February 17th, American aggressors continuously dropped various insects containing various bacteria in vast areas of North Korea, using different methods. This fact proves that these vicious acts of American imperialism are not minor, isolated, or tentative atrocities, but a manifestation of a planned, long-prepared, and large-scale launch of bacteriological warfare.
    The fact that the American invading army is launching this kind of germ warfare today deserves our deep attention.
    The "mobile warfare," "positional warfare," "attrition warfare," and "air strangulation warfare" waged by American imperialism in Korea have completely failed after suffering devastating blows from the Chinese and Korean People's forces. It is now attempting a desperate struggle by poisoning the innocent people of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's forces with this inhumane method.
    The crimes of the American aggressors in massacring peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean People's forces clearly can only further arouse the anger of the Chinese and Korean people, and cannot remedy its disastrous military situation in Korea.
    Regardless of the motives of American imperialism, we must now expose this inhumane atrocity and its conspiracy to threaten the good people of the world as much as possible. The preparation of bacteriological weapons by American imperialism has long been an open secret. For example, about two years ago, the New Era magazine reported that in Camp Detrick in the United States, under the guise of the "Special Projects Department," it specialized in the research of various cruel bacterial weapons. At the same time, it engaged in various similar arrangements in several places in West Germany, such as the Biochemical Institute in Tubingen, which specialized in finding bacteria that are extremely easy to reproduce; and the Biochemical Institute in Hamburg, which specialized in finding nerve agents. Undoubtedly, these types of organizations and the seven bacteriological weapons laboratories presided over by the then Canadian Minister of National Defence, Solandt, had some secret connections. These are just facts related to the experimental stage. By 1951, the New China News Agency's Korean front dispatch had briefly reported how it applied this type of experimental result to more than 125,000 North Korean prisoners of war on Geoje Island in Korea, and how it used Japanese bacterial war criminals to deploy bacterial warfare plans in Korea. These facts cannot but convince us that this atrocity of American imperialism is planned and has been prepared for a long time. This atrocity is also clearly a preparation for it to attempt to launch another world war.
    We warn the American aggressors: The Chinese people, tempered in a long revolutionary war, will resolutely fight to the end against the brutal aggressors for the sake of the safety of our motherland, for world peace, and for human justice, and are confident of achieving complete victory. No tricks of ghosts or monsters can in any way hinder our great historical mission. Perpetrators and accomplices must remember: one day in the future, they will inevitably eat the bitter fruit of their own actions.

### 美国侵略者必将自食恶果

    美国侵略者必将自食恶果
    中国科学院副院长  李四光
    美帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜居然疯狂地干出灭绝人性的暴行。新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电，已对此作了确凿的报道。美国兽军们从飞机上散布大批的小虫中，含有鼠疫、霍乱等等病菌，初步检验的结果已证实了这一点。
    从一月二十八日到二月十七日的期间，美国侵略者连续在北朝鲜广大地区，用不同的方式，投下含着各种细菌的各种虫类。这一事实已经可以证明美帝国主义这些凶恶举动，并不是一些零细的、个别的、尝试性的暴行，而是有计划、有长期准备、大规模地来发动细菌战争的一种表现。
    美国侵略军在今天发动这种细菌战争，是值得我们深切注意的。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜所进行的什么“运动战”、“阵地战”、“杀伤战”、“飞机绞杀战”，在遭到中朝人民部队毁灭性的打击后，已完全失败。它竟然用这种灭绝人性的方法毒害朝鲜无辜的人民和中朝人民部队，妄图作垂死挣扎。
    美国侵略者这种残杀朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民部队的罪行，很清楚，只能更加激起中朝人民的愤怒，而对它在朝鲜军事惨败的局面是无法补救的。
    无论美帝国主义的动机怎样，我们现在必须把它这种灭绝人性的暴行，和它威胁世界善良人民的阴谋，尽量揭发出来。美帝国主义对制造细菌武器的准备，早已是公开的秘密，例如大约在两年以前，新时代杂志曾经报道过在美国康普、狄特里克地方，在“特别计划部”的伪装名义下，专门研究各种惨毒的细菌武器；同时它在西德若干地方从事种种类似的布置，例如在土秉根的生物化学馆专找极容易繁殖的细菌；在汉堡生物化学馆专找毒心剂。无疑的，这一类的组织和当时加拿大国防部主席索兰德所主持的七个细菌武器实验室多少暗中是有联系的。这些只是有关试验阶段的事实。到了一九五一年，它如何把这一类实验结果，应用在朝鲜巨济岛北朝鲜十二万五千多战俘身上，又如何使用日本细菌战犯，在朝鲜布置细菌作战计划，新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电已经扼要地报道了。这些事实不能不让我们相信美帝国主义这一次的暴行是有计划的，也是有长期准备的。这种暴行，也显然是它企图发动再一次世界大战的一种准备。
    警告美国侵略者：在长期革命战争中锻炼出来的中国人民，为了我们祖国的安全，为了世界和平，为了人类正义，对残暴的侵略者将坚决斗争到底，而且有信心能够得到完全的胜利。任何鬼蜮的伎俩，决不能丝毫阻挠我们伟大的历史使命。作恶者和帮凶者必须记着：将来有一天，他们必然要自食后果的。
