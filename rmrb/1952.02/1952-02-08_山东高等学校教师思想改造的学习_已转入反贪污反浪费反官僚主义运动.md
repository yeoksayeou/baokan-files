    Shandong Higher Education Teachers' Thought Reform Study Movement, since its commencement in late November of last year, has completed the first stage of learning after seven weeks, ending in mid-January of this year.  A total of 1,023 people have participated in the study, including almost all teachers and some staff members.  According to the plan of the Shandong Provincial Higher Education Teachers' Study Committee, the thought reform study is divided into three stages—the first stage, thought mobilization; the second stage, resolving ideological issues; the third stage, studying national construction and educational reform issues.  The specific requirement of the first stage of study was to correct the study attitude, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and initially and comprehensively expose various ideological problems.  After seven weeks of study, this goal has basically been achieved.  It is currently estimated that about three-quarters of the people have a positive and conscious attitude towards ideological reform, and some professors and doctors who have never been interested in politics have also actively participated in this study. In the past, Qilu University had never systematically led teachers' study, but this thought reform study movement has been carried out quite well.  Each college and school has made it the responsibility of the leading cadres to take charge and personally lead, regarding the teachers' thought reform study as one of the central tasks of the school.  Most teachers have begun to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, and have also begun to dare to criticize leading comrades.  Along with carrying out criticism and self-criticism, many problems in work and personal thought have been exposed and revealed.  For example, the problems of disunity that existed historically within some colleges and departments, or between departments, have also begun to be exposed and gradually resolved.

    The first stage of study was generally carried out in two steps.  The first step focused on solving the problems of study attitude and study methods (while exposing some ideological problems); the second step focused on comprehensively exposing various ideological problems (while further improving the enthusiasm and consciousness of study, and further carrying out criticism and self-criticism).  The Shandong Provincial Higher Education Teachers' Study Committee also invited Xia Zhengnong, Deputy Director of the Provincial Government's Culture and Education Committee, to give two mobilization reports.

    Currently, on the basis of the first stage of study, the schools have moved into the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.  It is estimated that through this movement, a more favorable foundation will be laid for the teachers' thought reform study. (Zhang Dagan)

    山东高等学校教师思想改造的学习
    已转入反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    山东高等学校教师思想改造学习运动，自去年十一月下旬开始以来，到今年一月中旬，共进行七周，业已结束第一阶段的学习。参加学习的已有一千零二十三人，包括几乎全部教师和一部分职员。按照山东省高等学校教师学习委员会的计划，思想改造学习共分为三个阶段——第一阶段，思想动员；第二阶段，解决思想问题；第三阶段，学习国家建设和教育改革问题。第一阶段学习的具体要求是端正学习态度，开展批评和自我批评，初步地全面地暴露各种思想问题。经过七周学习，基本上已达到了这个目的。目前估计，约有四分之三的人数，对于思想改造抱有积极的、自觉的态度，有些向来不问政治的教授、医生也积极参加了这次学习。过去齐鲁大学从没有有计划地领导过教师学习，这次思想改造学习运动却开展得相当好。各院、校都作到了首长负责、亲自领导，以教师思想改造学习为学校当前的中心工作之一。大部分教师开始运用批评和自我批评的武器，也开始敢于向领导同志开展批评了。和开展批评与自我批评的同时，暴露并揭发了工作上及个人思想上的不少问题。如有些院、校系科内部或系科之间在历史上存在的不团结问题，也开始暴露出来并逐渐获得解决。
    第一阶段学习大体是分作两个步骤进行的。第一步，着重解决学习态度、学习方法问题（同时暴露一部分思想问题）；第二步，着重全面地暴露各种思想问题（同时进一步提高学习的积极性、自觉性，进一步开展批评和自我批评）。山东省高等学校教师学习委员会并曾经邀请省府文化教育委员会夏征农副主任作过两次启发动员报告。
    目前，各校已在第一阶段学习的基础上，转入反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动。估计经过这一运动，将为教师思想改造学习打下更有利的基础。  （张达干）
