To the Editor: After reading in the newspaper about the unscrupulous merchants Zhang Xingen, Liu Yunsheng, and others who harmed the Volunteer Army, we felt extremely indignant. We remember that in the winter before last year and the spring of last year, we ate rotten eggs and rotten meat more than once on the front lines in Korea. Some comrades became ill after eating these things, which affected marching and combat. We discovered that the "Pork Leg Canned Goods" produced by the Yimin Company of the East China Industrial Department and the Kailin Company of Shanghai had very nice packaging, but the cans were full of water and the quality was extremely poor. Several times, the preserved eggs, cured meat, and fish, etc., that were shipped arrived in entire boxes that were inedible. At the time, we thought that this was because the transportation was inconvenient and they had spoiled on the way. But then we thought, how could fish and meat spoil in the cold weather of December and January? Only now do we know that this was a trick played by the unscrupulous merchants. From these facts, we can fully see the reactionary nature of the unscrupulous merchants. How vicious and insidious they are! The people of the motherland support us wholeheartedly, but these illegal merchants take the opportunity to harm us. In addition to joining the people of the motherland in demanding severe punishment for these illegal merchants, we hope that the people of the whole country will further recognize the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on us from these ironclad facts, and more firmly resolve to defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. Launch the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in depth, and do not withdraw until the unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements are eliminated! We are on the front lines in Korea, guaranteeing to cherish national property, severely strike at American imperialism, and answer the motherland's love for us with victories in battle.

    志愿军某部程刚等同志
    控诉奸商暗害志愿军的罪行
    编辑同志：我们从报纸上看到奸商张新根，刘云生等，暗害志愿军的消息以后，心中非常气愤。记得前年冬天和去年春天，我们在朝鲜前线不止一次地吃到臭蛋、臭肉。有些同志吃了这种东西，就病倒了，使行军、作战受到影响。我们发现过华东工业部益民公司的出品，和上海开林公司出的“猪腿罐头”，装璜很好，但筒里都是汤水，质量极其低劣。有几次运来的松花蛋、腊肉、鱼肉等，整箱整箱地不能吃。当时我们还认为这是运输不便在道上搁坏了。但一想十冬腊月天气，鱼、肉怎么能变坏呢？今天才知道这是奸商们玩的鬼把戏。从这些事实中，我们可以充分地看出奸商们的反动本质。他们是多么的恶毒、阴险呵！祖国人民全心全意地支援我们，但这些不法奸商却乘机暗害我们。我们除了和祖国人民一样地要求严惩这些不法奸商外，并希望全国人民从铁的事实中，进一步地认识资产阶级向我们猖狂进攻的阴谋诡计，更加坚定我们打退资产阶级猖狂进攻的斗志。深入展开反贪污、反行贿运动，不肃清奸商和贪污分子，不要收兵！我们在朝鲜前线，保证爱护国家资财，狠狠打击美帝国主义，用战斗的胜利来回答祖国人民对我们的热爱。
