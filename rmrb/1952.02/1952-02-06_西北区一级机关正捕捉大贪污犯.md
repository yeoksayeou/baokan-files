Northwest Region Level One Organs are Capturing Major Embezzlers
[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Northwest Region Level One Organs has entered a new high tide of fiercely besieging major embezzlers, beginning on February 1st. In order to further concentrate all forces to besiege major embezzlers, the Northwest Region Level One Organs Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee convened its fourth committee meeting on February 2nd. The meeting discussed and approved the work report of the committee's Secretary-General, Tan Shengbin. Ma Wenrui, Director of the Northwest Region Level One Organs Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, gave a concluding speech at the meeting.

In his speech, Ma Wenrui pointed out that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Northwest Region Level One Organs has achieved great success. General minor corruption problems have been largely exposed, a portion of medium-level corruption has been exposed, and major embezzlers have been isolated. In the struggle, the masses have developed a high degree of hatred for corrupt behavior, which has dealt a head-on blow to the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the revolutionary ranks. However, major embezzlers are only beginning to be exposed. According to the materials already grasped, there are still a large number of major embezzlers who have not bowed their heads to the people, vainly attempting to quibble and resist stubbornly. He emphasized that these major embezzlers are agents of the bourgeoisie carrying out sabotage in the revolutionary ranks. If this group of "big tigers" who devour state property are not thoroughly eliminated by mobilizing the broad masses, they will continue to harm the country and the people, and the country's various constructions will not be able to proceed smoothly. He said that the previous stage of the struggle has created favorable conditions for the current siege of major embezzlers. Under the watchful eyes of the public, these "tigers," both large and small, who harm the people, have fallen into complete isolation. Therefore, we must continue to pursue them relentlessly, making sure to track them all down and not let one escape, and not stop until the goal is achieved. Ma Wenrui pointed out that the attack on major embezzlers is a crucial battle in the anti-corruption struggle, a battle of decisive significance. Only by completely breaking through these bunkers can the anti-corruption struggle be considered finally victorious. Therefore, this battle must be fought well, must be won, and the forces must be reorganized and re-equipped, investigation and research must be strengthened, clues must be searched for, tracking and pursuit must be intensified, firepower must be concentrated, and a fierce attack must be launched until they are captured. At the same time, close contact should be made with the industrial and commercial sectors' anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-fraud, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of national economic intelligence movement to encircle them from both inside and outside, layer by layer. In carrying out this battle, leadership must be strengthened, and commanders must personally go to the front line to direct operations. He said that besieging and capturing major embezzlers from all sides is a serious political task at present, and it must be carried out vigorously and resolutely to the end. Finally, he solemnly announced that all embezzlers who voluntarily confess and thoroughly repent before February 10 will still be treated leniently as voluntary confessions; otherwise, those who exceed the deadline will be treated as stubbornly resisting and will be punished more severely.

    西北区一级机关正捕捉大贪污犯
    【本报讯】西北区一级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已在二月一日开始进入向大贪污犯猛烈围攻的新高潮。为了进一步集中一切力量围攻大贪污犯，西北区一级机关增产节约委员会在二月二日召开了第四次委员会议。会议讨论并通过了该会秘书长谭生彬的工作报告。西北区一级机关增产节约委员会主任马文瑞在会上作了总结性的讲话。
    马文瑞在讲话中指出：西北区一级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已获得很大成绩。一般小的贪污问题已大部暴露，中等贪污暴露了一部分，孤立了大贪污犯。群众在斗争中增长了对贪污腐化行为高度的憎恨情绪，这就迎头痛击了资产阶级对革命队伍的猖狂进攻。但是，大贪污犯才开始暴露，据已掌握的材料来看，还有一大批大贪污犯没向人民低头，妄想狡赖顽抗。他着重指出：这些大贪污犯是资产阶级在革命队伍里进行破坏勾当的代理人，如果不发动广大群众彻底打尽这一批吞噬国家财产的“大老虎”，以后，仍会继续危害国家人民，国家的各种建设也就不可能顺利进行。他说：前一阶段的斗争已给目前进行围攻大贪污犯造成了有利条件，在众目睽睽之下，这些危害人民的大小“老虎”已陷于完全孤立。所以，今后必须乘胜穷追，一定要把他们全部追查出来，不让一个漏网，不达目的决不停止。马文瑞指出：向大贪污分子的进攻，是反贪污斗争中的一个攻坚战，是具有决定意义的战斗，只有完全攻破这些碉堡，反贪污斗争才算最后取得胜利。所以，这一仗必须打好，必须胜利，而且必须重新组织与配备力量，加强调查研究，搜寻线索，跟踪追击，集中火力，猛烈进攻，直至捕获而后止。同时要与工商界的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反欺骗、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动取得密切联系，以内外夹攻，层层包围。在进行这一战斗时，更须加强领导，指挥官必须亲上前线指挥作战。他说：从四面八方围困与捕捉大贪污分子，是目前严重的政治任务，必须大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地进行到底。最后，他郑重宣布：凡贪污分子在二月十日以前，自动坦白并确实彻底者，仍以自动坦白，从宽论处；否则，超过限期，即以顽抗论处，加重处分。
