    Wasteful Phenomena in the People's Daily's Building Construction Project
    Comrade Editor: The serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Jinan People's Daily has caused significant waste. The People's Daily began constructing a large building in June of last year. Before construction began, the leading cadres did not consult with the newspaper's staff and workers, but acted solely on their own opinions. After work began, merely reducing the size of the building's foundation resulted in a massive waste of labor. Other projects, such as the construction of the club and kitchen, also involved rework and waste. This project is not yet complete, and it has already cost 2.7 billion yuan. Zhou Tiemin, the director of the administrative department, has consistently disregarded public property. Last year, he arbitrarily lent over 5.2 million yuan of public funds to a private merchant (his friend), calculated as 800 "discount units." When the private merchant repaid the loan, due to the decline in the price of these units, there was a loss of over 800,000 yuan.

    大众日报修盖楼房工程有浪费现象
    编辑同志：济南市大众日报领导干部严重的官僚主义作风，造成了很大浪费。大众日报在去年六月开始修建大楼一座，在修建以前，领导干部也不和报社职工商量，只凭自己的意见办事。开工后，只大楼基础打小了一点，就浪费了大量人工；其他如修盖俱乐部、伙房等都有返工浪费情形。这个工程还没有完成，已经花了二十七亿元。行政部主任周铁民一贯不重视公家财产，去年他擅自把公款五百二十多万元借给私商（他的朋友），算作八百个折实单位。当私商还款时，因折实单位牌价下跌，凭空损失了八十多万元。  霍成维
