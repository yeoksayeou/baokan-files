    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 21st. At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 21st, our side continued to denounce the other side's unreasonable attitude in opposing the neutral countries proposed by our side without any reason. The other side absurdly claimed: "The United Nations Command believes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be composed of countries that are not adjacent to Korea and have no past records of involvement in the Korean issue." Our side strongly criticized this absurd argument, sternly questioning the other side's logic in excluding countries adjacent to Korea as neutral countries. Our side pointed out: "If the neutral countries proposed by our side have any record on the Korean issue, it is that they firmly oppose interference in the Korean War and firmly advocate a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Your side cannot deny that every neutral country proposed by our side meets the definition of a neutral country agreed upon by both sides; your side cannot deny that the Soviet Union is the strongest country in opposing interference in the Korean War and advocating a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Your side cannot offer any reason, nor is there any reason, to oppose any of the neutral countries proposed by our side." The other side had no response and even claimed that "this is our side's unilateral reason and cannot be discussed." Our side once again suggested that the other side seriously consider the reasonable solution proposed by our side: both sides simultaneously and once express agreement to the neutral countries nominated by the other side, and withdraw the other side's unreasonable opposition to the neutral countries proposed by our side.
    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, the two sides exchanged views on the wording of the amendments to the draft proposed by our side on February 20.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我方痛斥美方关于中立国的荒谬论点
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方继续指责对方毫无理由地反对我方所提出的中立国家的蛮不讲理的态度。对方荒谬地声称：“联合国军认为中立国监察委员会应出自那些不与朝鲜邻近而且没有过去参预朝鲜问题的记录的国家。”我方痛斥对方的这种荒谬论点，严词质问对方根据什么逻辑排除邻近朝鲜的国家作为中立国。我方指出：“如果我方提出的中立国家在朝鲜问题上有任何记录的话，那就是它们坚决反对干涉朝鲜战争，它们坚决主张和平解决朝鲜问题。你方不能否认我方所提出的每一个中立国都是符合于双方协议的中立国的定义的；你方不能否认苏联是反对干涉朝鲜战争与主张和平解决朝鲜问题最力的国家。你方提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由反对我方所提出的任何一个中立国家。”对方无词以对，竟称“这是我方单方面的理由，不能加以讨论”。我方再次建议对方郑重考虑我方所提出的合理解决方案：双方同时并一次对另一方所提名的中立国家表示同意，并撤消对方对于我方所提中立国家的毫无理由的反对。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方就我方二月二十日所提草案各款修正稿措辞交换意见。
