Hebei Provincial People's Court Temporary Tribunal
Verdict on the Major Corruption Criminals Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan

The major corruption criminal Liu Qingshan was the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Tianjin Local Committee, and before his arrest, he was the Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee. The major corruption criminal Zhang Zishan was the Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Tianjin Local Committee and Commissioner of the Tianjin Special District, and before his arrest, he was the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Tianjin Local Committee.

Based on the investigation results of the Case Investigation and Handling Committee, the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Hebei Provincial People's Government Supervision Committee, and the joint investigation and interrogation by the Hebei Provincial People's Government Public Security Department, the following crimes of the two criminals are confirmed:

Under the severe erosion of bourgeois decadent ideology, the two criminals took advantage of their positions to embezzle airport construction funds, shipbuilding loans for flood-stricken areas, river works funds, relief grain for cadres' families, local grain, deducted grain for migrant workers, and fraudulently obtained bank loans, totaling 17.16272 billion yuan, which was used to operate the "agency production" secretly controlled by the two criminals.

The two criminals even more unscrupulously engaged in illegal business activities with the stolen, deducted, and fraudulently obtained funds. In April 1951, they colluded with the profiteer Zhang Wenyi (female) and others, paying 4.9 billion yuan to speculate in steel; the profiteers used this fund for speculation and profiteering, causing the loss of 2.1 billion yuan of state funds. In May of the same year, in order to steal timber from the Northeast, the two criminals sent people to impersonate military officers, and disregarding the suffering of the disaster victims, heartlessly occupied the aforementioned 400 million yuan of shipbuilding loans for flood-stricken areas.

In March 1951, in order to expand "agency production" and engage in construction speculation, the two criminals bought private timber yards in Tianjin to establish a construction company, and dared to lure 31 engineering technicians from state-owned and public-owned enterprises and institutions in Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and other places with high salaries, seriously undermining national policies.

In 1950 and the spring of 1951, when repairing the Chaobai, Yongding, Daqing, Longfeng, Haihe, and other river projects, the two criminals organized river works supply stations to profit from them. They sold the good grain issued by the state to migrant workers and replaced it with bad grain, and raised the prices of migrant workers' food (grain, oil, and vegetables), successively exploiting migrant workers and stealing depreciation fees totaling 2.2 billion yuan.

According to the investigation and interrogation results, it is proved that the two criminals colluded with each other, and should bear the responsibility of conspiracy and joint crime for the above-mentioned serious crimes.

From the state property stolen by Liu and Zhang, the two criminals embezzled and squandered a huge sum of more than 378.25 million yuan; including more than 183.99 million yuan by Liu and more than 194.26 million yuan by Zhang. They squandered money, enjoyed themselves, openly bribed, and became extremely corrupt and degenerate. Liu even became addicted to drug use.

Liu and Zhang attempted to evade responsibility for their crimes and tried in various ways to cover up their tracks. Zhang once burned 378 receipts in one instance.

In summary, the major corruption criminals Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's serious crimes of stealing state property, exploiting migrant workers and disaster victims, colluding with profiteers to engage in illegal business for profit, disintegrating state-owned enterprises and institutions, and embezzling and bribing are supported by conclusive evidence, and the two criminals have also confessed to them. Such betrayal of the country and the people is extremely heinous and cannot be tolerated by national law. With the approval of the order of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, the major corruption criminals Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan are sentenced to death and executed immediately, and all their personal property is confiscated. Other accomplices in the case will be tried separately.

    河北省人民法院临时法庭
    判处大贪污犯刘青山张子善的判决书
    大贪污犯刘青山曾任中国共产党天津地方委员会书记，就捕前任中国共产党石家庄市委员会副书记。大贪污犯张子善曾任中国共产党天津地方委员会副书记、天津专区专员，就捕前任中国共产党天津地方委员会书记。
    根据本案调查处理委员会、河北省人民检察署、河北省人民政府人民监察委员会及河北省人民政府公安厅会同调查侦讯结果，证实该二犯如下罪行：
    该二犯在资产阶级腐朽思想的严重侵蚀下，利用职权，盗用飞机场建筑款、救济水灾区造船贷款、河工款、干部家属救济粮、地方粮，克剥民工供应粮及骗取银行贷款等总计达一百七十一亿六千二百七十二万元，用于经营该二犯所秘密掌握的“机关生产”。
    该二犯更以盗窃克扣及骗取之资财，肆无忌惮地从事非法经营活动。一九五一年四月勾结奸商张文义（女）等付以四十九亿元巨款，倒买钢铁；该奸商等并曾利用此款投机倒把，使国家资财损失达二十一亿元。同年五月该二犯为从东北盗买木料，派人冒充军官，并不顾灾民疾苦，忍心占用前述之救济水灾区造船贷款四亿元。
    一九五一年三月，该二犯为扩大“机关生产”，从事建筑投机，在天津收买私商木厂成立建筑公司，竟敢高薪利诱天津、沈阳、鞍山等地国营、公营企业机关的工程技术人员三十一名，严重地破坏了国家政策。
    一九五○年暨一九五一年春，兴修潮白、永定、大清、龙凤、海河等各河工程时，该二犯组织河工供应站，从中渔利，曾将国家发给民工之好粮出卖，换成坏粮，并抬高民工食品（粮、油、菜）价格，先后剥削民工及窃取折旧费共二十二亿元。
    根据调查侦讯结果，证明该二犯狼狈为奸，对以上严重罪行应负合谋共犯的责任。
    刘、张二犯从盗窃之国家资财中，贪污挥霍达三亿七千八百二十五万余元之巨；内计刘犯一亿八千三百九十九万余元，张犯一亿九千四百二十六万余元。挥霍享受，公行贿赂，腐化堕落，达于极点。刘犯且吸食毒品成瘾。
    刘、张二犯企图逃避罪责，曾多方设法掩盖罪迹。张犯一次即曾焚毁单据三百七十八张。
    总上所举大贪污犯刘青山、张子善盗窃国家资财，剥削民工灾民，勾结奸商非法经营谋利，瓦解国家企业机关及贪污行贿等严重罪行，证据确凿，该二犯亦已供认不讳。如此背叛国家背叛人民，实属罪大恶极，国法难容。奉中央人民政府最高人民法院令准，判处大贪污犯刘青山、张子善死刑，立即执行，并没收其本人全部财产。同案其他各犯另行审判。
