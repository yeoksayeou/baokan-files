    A Factory Specializing in Manufacturing "Sugar-Coated Bullets"
    ——A Record of Crimes of Corrupting Cadres, Evading Taxes, and Engaging in Tax Evasion by奸商 of the Chongqing Dahan Tobacco Factory
    Li Siheng

    The Dahan Tobacco Factory in Chongqing can be described as a factory specializing in manufacturing "sugar-coated bullets." As soon as government and state-owned enterprise personnel came into contact with it, the factory's manager,奸商 Liu Wuqing (an anti-revolutionary element, already arrested) and Wang Zushou, would do everything possible to corrupt them until those with weak wills became their prisoners and assistants in stealing state property.

    In order to evade national taxes and steal state assets, Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou first chose Yang Jie, the secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Taxation Bureau, as their target. Yang Jie was a retained employee who had been dishonest before liberation. When Liu Wuqing learned that a friend's fiancée of Yang Jie was looking for a job, he immediately promised: "No problem, she can work at my factory." This is how they got in touch. After that, they invited Yang Jie to dinner, played mahjong, and talked secretly, gradually ensnaring him. When Yang Jie's wife was coming to Chongqing from Chengdu, Liu Wuqing immediately made a long-distance call to the Chengdu office of the Dahan Tobacco Factory to deliver "travel expenses." When Yang Jie's wife was robbed on the way to Chongqing and lost her clothes, Liu Wuqing immediately sent a sum of "clothing expenses." As the old year approached, Liu Wuqing prepared "New Year's expenses" for Yang Jie. Liu Wuqing knew that Yang Jie's mother liked to smoke, so he sent her canned foreign cigarettes. Later, Liu Wuqing understood Yang Jie's intentions, knowing that Yang Jie wanted to build an "economic foundation" and start a business, he immediately sent three boxes of cigarettes and opened a "Rongyi Tobacco Shop." Later, when the "Rongyi Tobacco Shop" collapsed, Liu Wuqing still "lent" Yang Jie money without limit. Because of this, whenever the government wanted to adjust the assessed price of the cigarette commodity tax, Yang Jie would always "inform" the Dahan Tobacco Factory in advance to make "preparations"; and he taught Liu Wuqing to exploit loopholes in the tax law, even declaring the tax on loose cigarettes in the tray that were not yet packaged, and massively evading taxes. Yang Jie personally handled cases related to tax evasion by the Dahan Tobacco Factory, and no matter whether the fine should be millions or tens of millions, he routinely wrote "exempt from fine" or "light fine."

    Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou were also on very close terms with Lin Xuexi, the chief of the commodity tax section, and Meng Jiwen, the chief of the cigarette tax section of the Chongqing Municipal Taxation Bureau. What were they up to? Nothing more than colluding to manipulate things. So no matter how Yang Jie handled the Dahan Tobacco Factory's case, Lin and Meng pretended to be deaf and dumb.

    Having gotten away with exploiting loopholes in commodity tax, Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou turned their attention to industrial and commercial tax. They used "sugar-coated bullets" to hit Wang Hongzhen, the chief of the direct tax section of the Chongqing Municipal Taxation Bureau. As usual, money could blind any corrupt element. Wang Hongzhen was also dragged into the water. In the summer of 1950, a large batch of tobacco leaves purchased by the Dahan Tobacco Factory from Xuchang was found by the Chongqing Municipal Taxation Bureau to have not been taxed. According to regulations, taxes and fines of 450 million yuan should be paid. As a result of Wang Zushou's bribery, it was "exempted from punishment."

    Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou did not relax their efforts towards the factory-stationed staff sent by the Taxation Bureau. They first attacked Pei Kangnian, a young cadre from the Southwest Service Corps. Pei Kangnian quickly became a protector of illegal capitalists. Every time he returned to the Taxation Bureau to report, he praised the Dahan Tobacco Factory, saying how "law-abiding" the Dahan Tobacco Factory was, and how Liu Wuqing "supported the tax policy," etc. He also helped Liu Wuqing "persuade" the workers, asking them to extend working hours and work overtime, creating excess profits for Liu Wuqing. After Pei Kangnian was transferred, another young cadre, Zhang Zongxiang, came. Liu Wuqing invited him to play cards, but Zhang dared not. Liu Wuqing deliberately lost, asking Zhang Zongxiang to "shovel soil" for him (meaning to win back the principal), and if he won, it would be Zhang Zongxiang's, and if he lost, Liu Wuqing would acknowledge it. Zhang Zongxiang fell into his trap. Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou also often held banquets, inviting the factory-stationed staff to eat and drink. The factory-stationed staff did not pay for meals at the Dahan Tobacco Factory, and they were also given notes to allow them to return to the Taxation Bureau to reimburse their meal expenses. During the New Year and old year, they routinely sent cigarettes with "Congratulations on the New Year." Zhang Zongxiang alone received ten cartons. The Dahan Tobacco Factory also repeatedly sent silver dollars to another factory-stationed staff member, Dong Runsheng, and assistant Liu Chi, under the pretext of "taking care of the difficulties in the lives of the factory-stationed staff." Liu Wuqing fully supplied the factory-stationed staff with cigarettes; if they couldn't finish smoking them, the factory-stationed staff could also take them out to sell. Liu Wuqing knew that Liu Chi liked to drink, so he prepared Luzhou aged Daqu liquor, allowing him to get drunk at work. In this way, Dong Runsheng issued tax invoices randomly, and Liu Chi also pretended to be deaf and dumb, following suit. Under the continuous attack of奸商's "sugar-coated bullets," the factory-stationed staff were completely disarmed. The responsibility of checking the number of boxes of cigarettes leaving the factory and affixing the seal of approval was entirely "contracted" by奸商, and even the stamps for stamping cigarette boxes, sealing the joint between the approval document and tax ticket and checking tax tickets were handed over to the factory for "safekeeping." The factory-stationed staff only took care of eating, taking money, smoking, playing mahjong, finding women, and reporting false accounts to the Taxation Bureau. And Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou took this opportunity to blatantly evade a large amount of taxes. In this way, the Dahan Tobacco Factory evaded as much as 1.2 billion yuan in taxes in 1950 alone. In addition, Liu Wuqing also instructed people to smear soap on the tax tickets, and after the cigarettes left the factory, they would peel them off and reuse them for the second and third time... According to conservative estimates, the Dahan Tobacco Factory produced 330 boxes of cigarettes per month, and calculating tax evasion at a minimum of one-third, it evaded more than 500 million yuan in taxes in half a year. Adding up the previous cases, the state's tax revenue suffered a huge loss of 2.4 billion yuan.

    The Dahan Tobacco Factory's ambition to steal state property was endless. Seeing that several "sugar-coated bullets" had "bloomed" and "hit the target," they turned their guns and fired "sugar-coated bullets" at the commodity tax section of the Southwest District Taxation Administration. Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou were very close to Yan Zijing, the chief of the commodity tax section, Wang Fen, a staff member, and Wang Rulin, who handled the cigarette tax. The Dahan Tobacco Factory had bribed Wang Fen with 2.1 million yuan in the name of a "loan." In May 1950, Chongqing cigarette manufacturers clamored about "heavy taxes," and the Southwest District Taxation Administration sent Wang Fen to investigate. Wang Fen "ate the food of others and spoke softly," acting as an echo of奸商, and wrote in his report that "the factories are heavily indebted, some are short of funds, unable to purchase raw materials, and are in a state of stagnation." The signing and submission from Yan Zijing, the chief of the commodity tax section, also wrote: "Cigarettes are currently in the peak season, production is visibly shrinking, and the phenomenon is abnormal, and it is determined that the main reason is the lack of capital turnover." Therefore, led by Yan Zijing, they insisted on implementing the "cigarette commodity tax accounting-for-factory-release method": large cigarette factories with a monthly output of more than 50 boxes could pay taxes half a month to a month after the cigarettes were released from the factory. This method was said to "accelerate capital turnover" and "cultivate tax sources," but in reality, it allowed奸商 to make large-scale use of overdue tax payments for speculation and profiteering. Later, the central government believed that this method did not comply with regulations and telegraphed all regions to stop it uniformly on July 15 of that year. However, Yan Zijing, Wang Fen, Wang Rulin, and other thieves emphasized "merchant difficulties," "consideration for both public and private," and "the central government does not understand the situation," dragging it on until the end of October before abolishing this method. After this method was abolished,奸商 were very unwilling and repeatedly "petitioned," asking the corrupt elements within the Southwest District Taxation Administration to insist on continuing it, and finally, in December of the same year, they implemented the "installment payment" method in a disguised form. In July 1951, the central government telegraphed again to stop this method. Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou colluded again with Lin Xuexi, Meng Jiwen, etc. of the Chongqing Municipal Taxation Bureau to notify the tax sub-bureaus in September: the cigarette tax of Dahan and other six cigarette factories would be paid uniformly three or four days after the enterprise company sold the cigarettes. For the third time, the central government did not approve this method, which contradicted the tax law and facilitated奸商's tricks. From "accounting for factory release" to "installment payment" to "factory release before tax payment," the tricks changed three times, but the essence was the same: the Southwest Taxation Administration, the Chongqing Municipal Taxation Bureau, and the corrupt elements of the Chongqing Municipal Enterprise Company all colluded to serve illegal capitalists, so that奸商 such as Liu Wuqing and Wang Zushou could calmly and unhurriedly "legally" play tricks and make a fortune.

    一座专门制造“糖衣炮弹”的工厂
    ——重庆大汉烟厂奸商腐蚀干部偷税漏税罪行录
    李思恒
    重庆市大汉烟厂可以说是一座专门制造“糖衣炮弹”的工厂。只要政府和国营企业的工作人员一和它接触，这个厂的经理、奸商刘武清（反革命分子，已被逮捕）和王祖寿就千方百计地进行腐蚀，直到那些意志薄弱的工作人员都成了他们的俘虏，成了他们盗骗国家财产的助手。
    刘武清、王祖寿为了偷漏国税，盗骗国家资财，首先选择了重庆市税务局的秘书杨洁为进攻对象。杨洁是留用人员，在解放前手脚不干净。刘武清当知道杨洁的朋友的未婚妻要找工作时，就一口承允：“没问题，到兄弟的厂里去工作。”这样拉上了线。以后就请杨洁吃饭、打麻将、密谈，渐渐上套了。杨洁的老婆要由成都来重庆，刘武清马上挂长途电话叫大汉烟厂成都营业处把“旅费”送上门去。杨洁的老婆来重庆的路上遭到匪劫，失去衣物，刘武清立刻送上一笔“制装费”。要过旧年了，刘武清给杨洁准备了“过年费”。刘武清晓得杨洁的母亲爱抽烟，就送来筒装的外国烟。后来刘武清摸透了杨洁的心，知道杨洁要打点“经济基础”，想做生意，马上送来三箱纸烟，开了个“蓉谊烟店”。以后“蓉谊烟店”垮台了，刘武清仍然无限地“借”给杨洁钱。就因为这样，凡是政府要调整卷烟货物税的核价的时候，杨洁总事先“关照”大汉烟厂早作“准备”；并且教刘武清钻税法的空子，连没有成包的盘子里的散烟，也一齐报了税，大肆偷漏。有关大汉烟厂偷漏税款的案子，杨洁便亲自动手办，不管应罚几百万、几千万，照例批上“免罚”、“轻罚”字样。
    刘武清、王祖寿和重庆市税务局货物税科长蔺学熙、卷烟税股股长孟继文也是称兄道弟，关系暧昧。葫芦里卖的什么药呢？无非为了上下其手。所以杨洁不管如何处理大汉烟厂的案子，蔺、孟也装聋卖傻。
    货物税方面的空子钻通了，刘武清、王祖寿又打工商税的主意。他们用“糖衣炮弹”射中了重庆市税务局直接税科科长王鸿桢。照例，钱可以蒙住任何贪污分子的眼睛。王鸿桢也被拖下水了。一九五零年夏天，大汉烟厂由许昌买来的大批菸叶没有纳税，被重庆市税务局查出来了。按照规定应当补税和罚款四亿五千万元。王祖寿行贿的结果，竟被“免予处罚”。
    刘武清、王祖寿对税务局派来的驻厂员也没有放松。他们首先向由西南服务团来的青年干部裴康年进攻。裴康年很快地就成了不法资本家的保护人。他每次回税务局汇报时都为大汉烟厂吹捧，说大汉烟厂如何“奉公守法”，刘武清如何“拥护税收政策”等。他并帮着刘武清“说服”工人，叫工人延长工时，加夜班，给刘武清创造超额利润。裴康年被调走了，又来了一个青年干部张宗祥。刘武清邀他打牌，张不敢打。刘武清便故意打输，让张宗祥替他“铲土”（捞回本钱的意思），赌赢了算张宗祥的，赌输了刘武清认账。张宗祥就掉进他的陷井里去了。刘武清、王祖寿还经常大摆筵席，请驻厂员大吃大喝。驻厂员在大汉烟厂搭伙食不要钱，还给打条子让驻厂员回税务局报销饭钱。过新年、旧年照例大送“恭贺年禧”的纸烟。光张宗祥一人就是十条。大汉烟厂又藉口“照顾驻厂员生活困难”，几次送银洋给另一个驻厂员董润生和助理员刘箎。刘武清充分供应驻厂员吸烟；吸不完的，驻厂员还可以拿出去卖。刘武清知道刘箎喜欢喝酒，就备好泸州陈年大曲酒，让他上班也喝得醉薰薰的。这样，董润生就乱开税票，刘箎也装聋卖傻，依样画葫芦。驻厂员在奸商“糖衣炮弹”的连续攻击下，完全解除了武装。查点出厂烟箱数目和贴印照证的责任，一概由奸商“包办”了，甚至连盖烟箱、印照骑缝和税票查验的戳记，就交给厂中“代为保管”了。驻厂员只管吃饭，拿钱，抽烟，打麻将，搞女人，向税务局报假账。而刘武清、王祖寿正好趁这机会明目张胆地大量漏税。这样，大汉烟厂在一九五零年一年就漏税十二亿元之多。另外，刘武清又指使人在税票上涂上肥皂，等烟出厂后就揭下来再用第二次，第三次……。据保守的统计，大汉烟厂每月出三百三十箱烟，按最低漏税三分之一计算，半年就漏税五亿多元。连前面几宗加起来，国家税收遭受了二十四亿元的巨大损失。
    大汉烟厂盗窃国家财产的野心是没有止境的。他看到几颗“糖衣炮弹”都“开花”了，“打中要害”了，就掉转炮口，把“糖衣炮弹”向西南区税务管理局的货物税科发射。刘武清、王祖寿和货物税科科长严子静、科员王汾、及经办卷菸税的王汝琳关系非常亲切。大汉烟厂就曾用“借款”名义向王汾行贿二百一十万元。一九五○年五月，重庆卷菸厂商叫嚣“税重”，西南区税务管理局派王汾去调查。王汾是“吃人的嘴软”，当了奸商的应声虫，回来写报告说：“各厂负债甚多，有的资金缺少，无法购买原料，陷于停顿状态。”货物税科科长严子静的签呈上也写着：“卷菸现为旺季，生产日见萎缩，现象反常，断定资金周转不灵是主要原因。”于是以严子静为首，坚持要实行“卷烟货物税记账出厂办法”：月产五十箱以上的大烟厂，可以在烟出厂后半月到一月再缴税。这种办法美其名曰“加速资金周转”、“培养税源”，实际上是使奸商大量利用滞纳税款投机倒把，夺取暴利。后来中央认为这个办法不合规定，电令各地在当年七月十五日一律停止。然而严子静、王汾、王汝琳这伙蟊贼，却强调“商人困难”、“公私兼顾”、“中央不了解情况”，一拖拖到十月底才废止这个办法。这个办法废止后，奸商很不甘心，一再“请愿”，要求西南区税务管理局内部的贪污分子再度坚持延续，终在同年十二月改头换面地实行了“分期纳税”的办法。一九五一年七月，中央又电令停止这个办法。刘武清、王祖寿又串通重庆市税务局的蔺学熙、孟继文等在九月通知各税务分局：大汉等六个烟厂的卷烟税，在企业公司出售纸烟后三、四日再统一缴纳。中央第三度没有批准这种和税法抵触、便于奸商捣鬼的办法。前后由“记账出厂”而“分期纳税”而“先出厂后纳税”，花样变了三次，本质却是一个，就是：西南税务管理局、重庆市税务局、重庆市企业公司的贪污分子一齐串通，替不法资本家服务，使刘武清、王祖寿等奸商可以从容不迫地“依法”捣鬼，大发横财。
