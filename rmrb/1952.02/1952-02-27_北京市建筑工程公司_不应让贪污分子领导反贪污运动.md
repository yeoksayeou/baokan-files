    Beijing Construction Engineering Company
    Should Not Allow Corrupt Elements to Lead the Anti-Corruption Movement
    To the Editor:
    The leadership of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company has allowed a corrupt element, Deputy Manager Cui Yancai, to lead the anti-corruption movement. Some corrupt elements say, "Cui Yancai himself is dirtier than I am, what qualifications does he have to lead the movement?" "We are just being told to confess, why doesn't Cui confess his problems in front of the masses?" In this way, the movement of course cannot be carried out.

    Cui Yancai constantly accepts bribes from the company's purchasing personnel. The major corrupt official Yang Jinshan (already sent to court) illegally purchased and transported a large quantity of timber in the Northeast, embezzling from it. Once, Yang Jinshan gave Cui Yancai seven felt blankets, and Cui praised him, saying, "You're really capable, we're all relying on you!" Last year, the Central Financial and Economic Commission sent an inspection team to investigate the company's illegal timber business. Cui secretly held a meeting to arrange that everyone was not allowed to approach the inspection team casually, nor were they allowed to talk about numbers. He also announced, "Whoever speaks will be responsible." The major corrupt official Zhou Ruichang (already sent to court) often brought back automatic swimming watches, hams, etc. from Shanghai and Guangzhou to give to him. In this anti-corruption movement, someone wrote a manuscript to the People's Daily, criticizing the leadership. Cui not only did not examine his own shortcomings, but spent a lot of time searching for the person who wrote the manuscript. He was afraid of being reported, and once bribed the nanny in his home, and instructed her, "Don't say anything no matter who asks!" Up to now, he has not made a single self-criticism in front of the masses. In order to thoroughly carry out the movement, I believe the leadership of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company should examine and deal with this issue. Cheng Xu

    Editor's Note: Cui Yancai's errors are serious. The Beijing Savings Inspection Committee should thoroughly investigate. Cui's erroneous behavior of suppressing criticism should also be investigated and announced.

### 北京市建筑工程公司  不应让贪污分子领导反贪污运动

    北京市建筑工程公司
    不应让贪污分子领导反贪污运动
    编辑同志：北京市建筑工程公司领导方面让贪污分子、副经理崔彦彩领导反贪污运动，有些贪污分子说：“崔彦彩本身比我还脏，有什么资格领导运动？”“光叫我们坦白，崔为什么不在群众面前交代问题？”这样，运动当然就不能开展了。
    崔彦彩不断接受公司采购人员的贿赂。大贪污犯杨金三（已送法院）在东北违法大量购运木材，从中贪污。有一次，杨金三送给崔彦彩七条毡子，崔夸奖他说：“你真能，我们全仗着你啦！”去年，中央财政经济委员会派检查组调查该公司违法经营木材的事，崔秘密开会布置，不准大家随便和检查组接近，也不准谈数字。他还宣布：“谁说了，谁负责。”大贪污犯周瑞昌（已送法院）经常从上海、广州带回自动游泳手表、火腿等送给他。在这次反贪污运动中，有人给人民日报写稿，对领导提出批评，崔不但不检查自己的缺点，却用很多时间搜查写稿的人。他害怕被检举，曾贿赂家中的保姆，并嘱咐：“谁问也不要说！”到现在为止，他没有在群众面前作过一次检讨。为了彻底搞好运动，我认为北京市建筑工程公司领导方面应检查处理这个问题。    程序
    编者按：崔彦彩的错误是严重的。北京市节约检查委员会应彻底究查。崔某压制批评的错误行为也应查明一并公布。
