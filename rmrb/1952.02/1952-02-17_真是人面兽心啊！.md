    Truly Beasts in Human Form!
    Tian Dama, No. 20 Heng Street, Fifth District, Beijing

    After reading the newspaper reports about the treacherous acts of merchants Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, Zhang Xingen, and others who harmed the Volunteer Army, I truly hate these conscienceless profiteers. Which Chinese person with a conscience does not love and respect our Volunteer Army? On our street, most people are rickshaw pullers, odd-job workers, and poor people running small businesses. However, when we heard the news about donating weapons to support the Volunteer Army, everyone competed to donate more money. Zhong Wenxi, a rickshaw puller, supports a family of four, yet he still donates 5,000 yuan every month. I had a pair of silver bracelets that I wore for my wedding, which I've kept for over thirty years and usually couldn't bear to wear. I donated them to the Volunteer Army to buy planes and cannons. Hearing that the Volunteer Army comrades like to read comic books, we sent them comic books. Hearing that the Volunteer Army lacked needles and thread, we packed needles, thread, and scraps of cloth for mending socks into comfort bags. The money we working people saved bit by bit to support the Volunteer Army was illegally stolen by Li Yinting in one fell swoop – 1.8 billion yuan! He had the heart to steal and replace good cotton, using rotten cotton to make emergency bandages for the Volunteer Army. Wang Kangnian embezzled the Volunteer Army's money for buying medicine for speculation and profiteering, and Zhang Xingen sold rotten beef as good meat to the Volunteer Army. Where did these merchants' consciences go? Truly beasts in human form!

    As I was thinking about this, I suddenly looked up and saw my neighbors Diao Rentai and Yu Luping coming in. I told them about the news in the newspaper, and they both gnashed their teeth in hatred. Diao Rentai said, "These merchants are dirtier than green bottle flies and more poisonous than poison. They are greedy for their own enjoyment and actually planned to scheme against the Volunteer Army." Yu Luping said, "Allowing these bad eggs to continue to exist will affect our motherland's rapid development!" We demand that the People's Government severely punish these merchants. We must actively help the government expose the crimes of illegal capitalists and tear off their smooth outer skin. We will not rest until we have caught all the "big tiger" merchants.

    真是人面兽心啊！
    北京市五区横街二十号　田大妈
    看到报上登载的奸商李寅廷、王康年、张新根等暗害志愿军的罪恶行为，我真恨死这些狼心狗肺的奸商。凡是一个有良心的中国人，那个人不爱护和尊敬我们的志愿军呢？我们这条街多是蹬三轮的、做零工的、做小买卖的贫苦人家，可是，当听到捐献武器支援志愿军的消息，大家都争着要多捐献一些钱。蹬三轮车的钟文喜，一家四口人靠着他吃饭，他每月还捐献五千元。我结婚时用的一付银镯，保存三十多年了，平素都舍不得带，我把它献给志愿军买飞机大炮。听说志愿军同志爱看连环画，我们送画给他们，听说志愿军缺少针线，我们把针线和缝补袜子的布头装在慰问袋里。我们劳动人民一点一滴节省下来支援志愿军的钱，李寅廷一次就非法盗窃十八亿元，他忍心盗换好棉花，用烂污棉花给志愿军制造救急包。王康年盗骗志愿军的买药钱投机倒把，张新根用臭牛肉充当好肉卖给志愿军。这些奸商的良心那里去了，真是人面兽心啊！
    我正在想着，猛抬头，看见街坊刁人泰、于绿萍走进来了，我把报上的消息告诉她俩，她俩个也都恨得咬牙。刁人泰说：“这些奸商比绿头蝇还脏，比毒药还毒，他们贪图自己享乐，居然把鬼算盘打到志愿军身上了。”于绿萍说：“允许这些坏蛋继续存在，便影响咱们祖国建设很快地向前发展！”我们要求人民政府严办这些奸商。我们要积极帮助政府检举不法资本家的罪行，把他们的光滑的外皮撕下来。不捉尽奸商“大老虎”，决不罢休。
