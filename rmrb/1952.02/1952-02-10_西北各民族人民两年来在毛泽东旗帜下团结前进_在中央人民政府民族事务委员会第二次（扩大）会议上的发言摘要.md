    Wang Feng, Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee
    In addition to the Han nationality, there are sixteen ethnic groups in the five provinces and one municipality of the Northwest region: Uyghur, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Dongxiang, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, Tu, Salar, Russian, Uzbek, Xibe, Tatar, Tajik, Manchu, and Solon. They have a total population of over 6.3 million, accounting for about one-fifth of the total population of the Northwest.
    Before liberation, these ethnic groups had long been in a tragic situation of oppression and discrimination. Due to the oppression and exploitation by successive reactionary ruling classes, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries – Great Han chauvinists – in recent decades, serious disunity had long existed among the ethnic groups, with deep-seated feelings of mutual suspicion, vigilance, and hostility. There were also many contradictions and disputes within each ethnic group. This seriously affected the unity and development of the people of all ethnic groups, forcing the political, economic, and cultural lives of more than six million minority people to be in a state more backward than that of the Han people. Many people lived in deep mountains and wilderness all year round, without adequate clothing or food, living in extreme poverty.
    After liberation, the people's governments and the People's Liberation Army at all levels in the Northwest region, in accordance with the ethnic policies of the Common Program, and following the principle of "prudence and steady progress," under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, united patriotic and democratic people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, forming an extremely broad national democratic united front. They have done a lot of work in minority areas. Over the past two years, after a series of practical works such as suppressing bandits, eliminating special agents, establishing ethnic democratic political power, training cadres, carrying out medical and trade work, restoring and developing production, especially after the Resist America, Aid Korea and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, not only has an unprecedented great unity been achieved among the ethnic groups and within the ethnic groups, but this unity has been further strengthened. The economic and cultural lives have also been initially improved, and the political consciousness of the broad masses of people has been rapidly raised. Loving the motherland and loving Chairman Mao have become the firm beliefs of the people of all ethnic groups. Here is a brief report on several major tasks.
    (1) Widely and deeply publicize ethnic policies; actively mobilize people of all ethnic groups to assist in suppressing bandits, eliminating special agents, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries; proactively mediate disputes, eliminate estrangement, strengthen ethnic unity, and stabilize social order. At the beginning of liberation, although the Kuomintang reactionary regime had been overthrown, the ethnic estrangement left over from history still existed. Remnant bandits and special agents were still taking the opportunity to instigate and sabotage. Therefore, at that time, all localities universally explained the policies of ethnic equality, unity, and freedom of religious belief to people of all strata through various forms such as forums, friendship meetings, unity meetings, and representative meetings, exposing the rumors and deceptions of bandits and special agents. Concrete facts were used to illustrate that unity was the greatest current interest of the people of all ethnic groups, calling on the people of all ethnic groups to rise up and actively assist the People's Liberation Army and local public security forces in suppressing bandits, eliminating special agents, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, proactively mediate the various existing disputes between and within ethnic groups. Coordinate with the central government's visiting delegation to visit various ethnic groups in the Northwest, and systematically organize representatives of various ethnic groups to participate in the National Day celebrations and other related meetings in Beijing, and visit major cities. The Han cadres and all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who entered the minority areas strictly observed discipline, respected the customs and habits of the people of all ethnic groups, constantly prevented and overcame the remnants of Great Han chauvinism, promoted a spirit of hard work, and served the people of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly. After two years of efforts, the bandits in the northwest border area have been basically eliminated, and great achievements have been made in the bandit suppression work. In Xinjiang alone, more than 45,000 bandits have been eliminated and more than 7,900 guns have been seized in the past two years. Bandit leaders Usman and Janim Khan have been brought to justice. As for various disputes that seriously affected ethnic unity, they have also been greatly reduced through the proactive mediation of governments at all levels. In the past two years, in accordance with the principles of ethnic equality and unity, more than 3,000 various disputes over grassland, water conservancy, agriculture and animal husbandry, land boundaries, and marriages have been mediated in the entire Northwest region through democratic consultations. This year alone, 320 cases have been mediated in Linxia sub-district of Gansu, more than 300 cases have been mediated in Tongde County of Qinghai in one year, and 260 cases have been mediated in Xiahe County of Gansu in half a year. Among them, large disputes such as the grassland dispute between the Tibetan Ganja and Jiawu tribes on the border of Qinghai and Gansu, the water conservancy dispute between Shache and Zepu, Maigaiti and Yecheng in Xinjiang, the pasture dispute between the Han and Kazakh nationalities in Changji, and the pasture land dispute between the Tibetan people in Shagou Temple in Yongchang County, Gansu and the Hui people in Huangchengtan in Weiyuan County, Qinghai. Some of these disputes have existed for 20 or 30 years, some for 40 or 50 years, and even more than 100 years. Once resolved, not only will the estrangement be eliminated and the unity enhanced, but also the masses will be educated and the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government will be greatly enhanced.
    However, we must not be arrogant and complacent because of the achievements we have already made. We must clearly recognize that although the social order in minority areas has been basically stabilized, there are still a few remaining scattered bandits continuing to rob and sabotage, and in some pastoral areas, the policies and decrees of the People's Government have not yet reached, and the work has not yet been carried out. Some historical disputes have not been completely resolved, and new disputes still occur. Some reactionary elements such as bandits, special agents, landlords, and bullies near the pastoral areas are attempting to sneak into the pastoral areas to carry out sabotage activities when the rent reduction, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements in agricultural areas deepen. Therefore, in places where there are bandit troubles and social order has not been completely stabilized, we must first concentrate our efforts to eliminate bandits and special agents, deeply carry out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and continue to vigorously mediate disputes in order to completely stabilize social order and remove obstacles to ethnic unity.
    (2) Actively and conscientiously promote regional autonomy and establish joint political power. To promote regional autonomy in ethnic minority areas and establish joint governments in areas where ethnic groups live together, based on the basic principles of democratic centralism and the people's representative conference system, is the long-cherished wish of the people of ethnic minorities and a fundamental policy for realizing ethnic equality and unity. The Communist Party organizations and people's governments at all levels in the Northwest region attach great importance to this.
    In ethnic minority areas, regional autonomy has been promoted and autonomous organs above the district level have been established in Dongxiang, where the Dongxiang ethnic group lives, Alxa Banner, Ejin Banner and Subei area, where the Mongolian ethnic group lives, and Zhuoni, Xiahe, Tongde, Tianzhu, Wuping and other areas, where the Tibetan ethnic group lives. The rest, such as Yushu Prefecture and pastoral counties in Qinghai, are actively preparing and are expected to be largely completed in February 1952. Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia provinces are also seriously and gradually promoting it based on the ethnic minority settlement situation and combining with various practical works. It should be noted that many ethnic minority settlements, districts, townships, and even counties, although not declared the establishment of autonomous organs, are actually led mainly by local ethnic cadres, and many staff members are also ethnic cadres. For example, in Tongxin County, Ningxia Province, the Hui population accounts for 77%, not only is the county head a Hui, but half of the general cadres are also Hui.
    In Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Shaanxi provinces, joint ethnic democratic governments have been universally established in all ethnic minority mixed-residence areas. All ethnic groups have roughly the corresponding representatives to their population in the government and bear the main responsibilities or participate in the leading work, and special care is given to ethnic groups with particularly small populations. Among the sixteen presidents and vice-presidents and one hundred and seventeen members of the people's governments of the four provinces of Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia, there are fifty-five minority members, of which six are presidents and vice-presidents. Eighty percent of the cadres above the district level of the government organs of the Xinjiang Province, including the ten prefectures (including eighty counties and cities) under the jurisdiction of the various bureaus and offices are local ethnic cadres. According to statistics in May 1951, twenty-two of the thirty-five counties and cities in Qinghai and Ningxia provinces have Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups as county heads and deputy county heads. Among the six counties and one city under the jurisdiction of Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, three county heads, two deputy county heads and one mayor of the city are all Hui cadres. There is a Kazakh autonomous township in Gonghe County, Qinghai Province, although there are only more than 130 people in the population, there is also a Kazakh member in the county people's government committee. In this way, the people of all ethnic groups truly enjoy equal rights in the organs of state power.
    The people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society, whether in mixed or concentrated areas, have been convened once to five times, and some areas have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress. The generation of representatives of all ethnic groups has also been roughly in accordance with the proportion of the population of each ethnic group, and the number of representatives has been reasonably allocated. For example, in Linxia County, the Han nationality accounts for 52% of the population, and the Hui nationality accounts for 48% of the population. The proportion of representative seats is also roughly in line with this (Han representatives account for 56%, and Hui representatives account for 44%). The total number of representatives to the first session of the third People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles in Yinchuan City, Ningxia was 211, and Hui representatives accounted for 43, slightly higher than the proportion of the total population of the Hui population in Yinchuan City.
    All regional autonomous organs or joint governments established in accordance with the basic principles of democratic centralism and the people's representative conference system are universally welcomed by the people of ethnic minorities. Whether in contacting the masses, implementing government decrees, training cadres, restoring and developing the political, economic and cultural activities of the people of all ethnic groups, it has played a great role in promoting. The people of ethnic minorities are indescribably excited to see their ethnic cadres take on the responsible leadership of governments at all levels and manage the affairs of their own ethnic groups in the form they like. After the establishment of the Dongxiang Autonomous Region, mass representative Ma Jiucheng happily said: "The Communist Party smashed the stone on our heads and we raised our heads. The Dongxiang people who have suffered for many years and cannot live, only saw the sun today, all because of the good leadership of Chairman Mao." In the three counties of Yushu Prefecture, everyone who heard about the propaganda of promoting ethnic regional autonomy, men, women, and children, clapped their hands and praised. Many people said: "In the past, under the rule of the reactionary government, our Tibetan people did not even have anyone as a section chief, today we elect people of our own ethnic group to be chairmen and manage our own affairs. Our wish for many years has come true today. This is the benefit of Chairman Mao's leadership."
    In the future, it is necessary to universally and conscientiously promote regional autonomy in ethnic minority settlements. This is the center of future political construction in ethnic minority settlements and must be greatly devoted to strive to universally establish all autonomous organs that should be established in 1952 and 1953. In places where joint governments have been established and regional autonomy has been promoted, the system of people's representative conferences should be implemented to further enrich and improve this system. The joint governments in mixed-residence areas must be appropriately equipped with cadres of all ethnic groups according to the proportion of the population, and attention should be paid to ensure that people from all walks of life have their own appropriate number of representatives in the organs of state power. The people's representative meetings of all ethnic groups at all levels must be held regularly, extensively absorbing representatives from all walks of life to participate, discussing and deciding on the current major issues, and when conditions are ripe, they should exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress, electing responsible personnel of the people's governments at all levels. Make the People's Representative Conference truly become the organ of power for the people's governments at all levels to contact the masses, implement government decrees, and for the people of all ethnic groups to realize the management of their own affairs.
    Secondly, based on the specific situation and existing experience in the Northwest region, ethnic regional autonomy must be promoted step by step. When promoting ethnic regional autonomy, agricultural areas must be combined with rent reduction and land reform, and pastoral areas must be combined with medical care, trade, and other practical work. Whether in agricultural or pastoral areas, we must combine the patriotic and internationalist education movement of Resist America, Aid Korea. At the same time, before the establishment of autonomous organs, preparatory institutions of different scales should be established based on the size of the settlement area, and people with representativeness from all walks of life should be widely absorbed through the methods of recommendation, election, and appointment to actively promote various matters related to the establishment of autonomous political power, especially to launch a propaganda and education movement for promoting regional autonomy among people from all walks of life to deliberate and consult on candidates for the people's government of the autonomous region. Because
    Generally, at the beginning, the minority masses lack a correct understanding of the promotion of regional autonomy, and many people mistakenly believe that the Communist Party will leave after the implementation of regional autonomy, fearing "what to do if the Communist Party cadres leave and there is no policy"; and some people with narrow nationalist sentiments believe that after the establishment of the autonomous region, they can leave the leadership of the Communist Party and the superior people's government and go to work "independently". Therefore, it is necessary to conduct systematic propaganda and education to the masses in conjunction with the promotion of regional autonomy. The process of promoting regional autonomy is the process of educating and improving the political awareness of the masses. In order to smoothly promote regional autonomy, it is necessary to continue to prevent and overcome the remnants of Great Han chauvinism in Han cadres (such as the erroneous view that "minority cadres are backward and cannot do things well, and if political power is handed over to them, it will be messed up"), and the remnants of narrow nationalist tendencies in minority cadres should also be appropriately prevented and overcome. Experience has proved that a passive, delayed or constrained attitude is wrong on the issue of promoting regional autonomy, and an unprepared, unstepwise, or laissez-faire attitude is also wrong.
    The organizational form of political power in ethnic areas must be suitable for the current stage of political and economic development of all ethnic groups, and through consultation and deliberation, take the form that most people of local ethnic groups are familiar with and willing to take. The set of district, township, and village political power in the Han or agricultural areas cannot be mechanically moved to ethnic minority areas or pastoral areas. The organizational forms of tribes, thousands, hundreds, and leagues and banners in pastoral areas can be preserved under the condition that the people of the ethnic group agree, and gradually enriched with new democratic content. Only when the ethnic democratic economy, politics, and culture have a new further development, and new organizational forms are needed to replace the current organizational forms that are no longer suitable, and are voluntarily changed by the broad masses of people and leaders in contact with the masses, should they naturally be changed. New democratic content must be realized completely and smoothly through ethnic forms.
    (3) Carry out trade and medical work to restore and develop the economy of farmers and herdsmen. After liberation, we resolutely implemented a fair and reasonable free trade policy in ethnic minority areas, consciously increasing the prices of local products and reducing the scissors gap between industrial products and local products, purchasing a large number of local products such as furs and medicinal materials, and transporting daily necessities such as tea and cloth. According to statistics, compared with the prices of industrial products, the prices of local products such as fur have generally increased relatively by one time, ten times, or even dozens of times in the past two years. For example, the ratio of Xinjiang wheat to khaki cloth increased to 400% in 1951 compared with 1949. The ratio of wool to khaki cloth increased to 180% in 1951 compared with 1949. Qinghai herdsmen can exchange fourteen and a half times more cloth with the same amount of wool today than before liberation. In May 1951, the ratio of camel hair to wheat in Ningxia Mengqi was 38 times higher than before liberation; only the state-owned trading company in Qinghai purchased 8.24 million jin of wool, 73,000 intestines, and 160,000 jin of medicinal materials before October 1950, plus the wool purchased by private merchants (about 10 million jin), which can be converted into 500,000 bolts of wide cloth. From October 1950 to July 1951, it purchased wool, medicinal materials, and other local products worth 55.662 million yuan in RMB. This greatly increased the income of herdsmen and improved their purchasing power. As a result, many pastoral areas felt that the supply of grain was in short supply, and the sales volume of top hats in Xining was more than ten times higher in 1950 than in previous years.
    Because the trading company adhered to the policy of uniting private merchants and supporting legitimate industry and commerce, industry and commerce in ethnic minority areas are also developing day by day. For example, in Dingyuanying, Ningxia, the number of households has increased from 49 before liberation to 299 now.
    Medical and health work has also achieved great success due to the importance attached to it by the central government and people's governments at all levels. In total, the central government and the northwest region allocated a special health fund of 18.142165 million jin of millet to ethnic minorities after liberation, and a large number of medicines were issued free of charge, equivalent to more than 4 million jin of wheat.
    In order to carry out trade and medical care in ethnic minority areas, in addition to setting up trade outposts and specialized institutions (286 in Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai) and health centers and hospitals in various places, we have also specially and selectively organized mobile trade groups and dispatched mobile medical teams to go deep into agricultural and pastoral areas to carry out work. According to incomplete statistics, the seventh central epidemic prevention team and the health institutions and epidemic prevention teams at all levels in the northwest region treated more than 450,000 people, vaccinated 200,000 people, and performed 108,000 epidemic prevention injections in ethnic minority areas from October 1950 to June 1951.
    These trade groups or medical teams in ethnic minority areas are not only a trade or medical institution, but also a political propagandist and organizer of the Communist Party and the People's Government, a political work team. For example, the mobile group organized by the Dulan Trading Branch Company in Qinghai went to Qumalai and Wangshidaishai to trade, not only completed the trade task, but also publicized the ethnic policy, tax policy, and patriotic ideology of Resist America, Aid Korea, which greatly improved the political understanding of the masses. For example, due to Ma Bufang's policy of ethnic instigation in the past, the upper and lower Guolu ethnic groups were not united. After the propaganda of the trade group, and in coordination with the mediation of party and government cadres, the two ethnic groups were united and friendly. Sometimes, for the needs of the work, the two can be organized in a mixed way, unified leadership, unified action, selling goods, treating diseases, propagating, and organizing at the same time. This is a good way to carry out mass work in pastoral areas. Therefore, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of ethnic minorities. However, these successful experiences have not been universally valued by party and government cadres in all regions, so they have not done everything possible to organize forces to carry out this work. In the future, under the unified leadership of the people's governments at all levels, all relevant departments must closely cooperate and organize all possible public and private forces to further develop on the existing basis. More mobile trade groups and mobile medical teams should be organized, and mixed work teams should be organized when necessary, in coordination with fixed trade and medical outposts, to go deep into remote agricultural and pastoral areas and send various policies of the People's Government to the houses and tents, and combine with vigorously organizing transportation and focusing on establishing markets to strengthen trade and medical work and give full play to its due role in the economy and politics.
    At the same time, we also firmly implemented the policy of protecting and supporting the development of animal husbandry in pastoral areas. In addition to preventing and controlling animal diseases, we also protected grasslands, improved water and grass, promoted the storage of winter grass, focused on issuing animal husbandry loans, and organized all possible (such as transportation, hunting, digging medicinal materials, etc.) sideline production. In agricultural areas, we built water conservancy projects, expanded the planting area, issued agricultural loans, provided disaster relief, organized labor mutual assistance, and increased food production. According to incomplete statistics, the Northwest region has injected and treated 2.4 million livestock in the past two years. In Xinjiang alone, 1.32 million livestock were treated in the past two years, exceeding the total number of treatments in the ten years of the Kuomintang period. In the movement to prevent and control diseases and insect pests in Qinghai Province in 1951, 250,000 blind rats were killed in Huangyuan and other four counties alone, according to existing statistics. According to incomplete statistics, the income from sideline production such as transportation and digging of medicinal materials in seven pastoral counties in the province reached 13.62 billion yuan. After two years of efforts, agriculture and animal husbandry in many areas of ethnic minorities have reached the pre-war level, and some areas have exceeded the pre-war production level. In addition, significant achievements have been made in water conservancy, epidemic prevention, and pest control in the agricultural areas of various ethnic groups. But for our long-term goals, this is just a great start. In the future, we must combine the actual situation of agricultural and pastoral areas to launch a large-scale patriotic production increase movement in order to gradually and fundamentally change the economic lives of the people of ethnic minorities.
    (4) Restore and develop cultural and educational undertakings in a planned and step-by-step manner. Over the past two years, culture and education in ethnic minority areas have been initially restored, and some areas have developed more than before liberation. There are currently 27 ethnic minority middle schools with 4,951 students and 2,214 primary schools with more than 300,000 students in the entire Northwest region. The number of middle and primary school students has increased by about one-third compared with before liberation. In Xinjiang alone, there are 1,877 universities, middle schools, and primary schools, an increase of 32% compared with before liberation; more than 298,500 students, an increase of 50% compared with before liberation. The number of Hui primary school students in Ningxia increased from 8,913 in 1950 to 10,246, an increase of 15% compared with last year. The number of Mongolian primary schools in Dingyuanying increased from 50 in 1950 to 200. There were only 17 Hui college students in Xi'an in 1949, and there were 34 in the first half of 1951; there were only more than 70 middle school students in 1949, and there were more than 110 in the first half of 1951; the increase in primary school students was even greater, with only 601 in the first half of 1949, and 1,437 in the first half of 1951, an increase of more than 139%.
    Newspapers and books published in ethnic minority languages ​​are warmly welcomed by the broad masses of ethnic minorities. There are already 17 newspapers published in ethnic minority languages ​​in the entire Northwest region, with a total circulation of more than 100,000 copies per issue. In Xinjiang alone, there are 14 newspapers published in Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Russian, and Xibe languages. Qinghai has a Tibetan newspaper. The Northwest Ethnic Affairs Committee has a Tibetan newspaper and a Mongolian newspaper. Many places have established newspaper reading groups. Tongren County, Qinghai (Tibetan settlement), has organized 113 Tibetan newspaper reading groups, and Guide County has also organized 58 Tibetan newspaper reading groups. The broadcasting industry has begun to be valued by various places. Xinjiang has established seven Uyghur, Kazakh, and Russian relay stations. In terms of the translation and publication of books, as of March 1951, Xinjiang had translated 83 Uyghur books and 38 Kazakh books. A total of 25 Uyghur and Kazakh books were published, with 158,000 copies. As of October 1951, 58 kinds of Chairman Mao's works had been translated into Uyghur (10 kinds published), 9 kinds into Kazakh (4 kinds published), and 1 kind into Mongolian. After the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", Xinjiang also specially organized the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Translation and Publication Committee to lead the publication of Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian "Selected Works of Mao Zedong".
    On the basis of preliminary improvement in economic life, people from all walks of life are very enthusiastic about learning culture. In the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951, 328,800 people from ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces participated in winter schools. In Xinjiang alone, 6,679 winter schools were established in the winter of 1950, with more than 256,000 students enrolled. After the winter school ended, more than 2,700 people in Dihua alone transferred to regular civil schools to study. More than 600 unemployed Hui youths and adults in Xi'an entered amateur schools to study, and more than 2,000 people participated in newspaper reading groups. The amateur art troupe of the Hui Cultural Center often has dozens of Hui youths studying. Even the mullas of the city's eleven mosques are organized to study culture and politics.
    In coordination with the development of medical and trade work and the performances of art troupes, films are shown to ethnic minorities (only selectively started). This "vivid, colorful, and visible" modern art is universally welcomed by ethnic minority audiences, expanding their new horizons and improving their new cultural life.
    The excellent cultural and artistic traditions of ethnic minorities, such as the dances and songs of the Uyghur and Kazakh nationalities in Xinjiang, are not only universally welcomed and loved by their own ethnic people, but also by other ethnic groups.
    However, it should be pointed out that our efforts are far from meeting the needs of ethnic minority people, especially in terms of newspapers and books published in ethnic minority languages, there is a greater lack; the research on the history, culture, and artistic traditions of ethnic minorities has not yet been seriously and systematically started; teachers in middle and primary schools are also in short supply. In this regard, we must pay due attention to it in the future. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of existing ethnic minority language newspapers and book publications, and allocate and train the necessary personnel to strengthen this work. A popular mass publication is urgently needed. Newspaper reading groups should continue to be universally organized. The research on the history, culture, and art of ethnic minorities should also be carried out in a planned way and with concentrated talent. More teachers must be trained for middle and primary schools.
    (5) Train cadres. This is the key to doing all work well in ethnic minority areas. Over the past two years, a large number of local ethnic minority cadres have been trained in the Northwest under the general principle of large-scale training and bold promotion and use. Not only is attention paid to the training of general cadres, but also attention has begun to be paid to the training of senior ethnic minority cadres and professionals (such as health, industry, trade, public security, art, language, etc.). According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 27,000 ethnic minority cadres who have left production in the entire Northwest region. If we add the cadres who have been trained in the current rent reduction and land reform and other work, there are about 30,000.
    Among the existing 27,000 ethnic minority cadres, except for a small number of old or older cadres who were trained and tempered in the revolution in the interior or the revolution in the three districts of Xinjiang, the vast majority were newly trained and promoted after liberation. Their main sources are three:
    (1) The majority are active elements who have been promoted and trained from the suppression of bandits, elimination of special agents, democratic political construction, Resist America, Aid Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and rent reduction, anti-bullies in agricultural areas, and various mass movements in pastoral areas. For example, in the transformation of rural political power in Aksu district, Xinjiang, 3,350 local ethnic cadres were trained and promoted.
    (2) Students trained from short-term training classes and cadre schools. For example, from March 1950 to August 1951, the Xinjiang Local Cadre School graduated 1,382 students from thirteen ethnic groups in two terms; there are still 1,450 students studying at the school. The Linxia Cadre Training Class in Gansu trained 748 cadres in 14 sessions. At present, the cadre schools for training ethnic minority cadres include the two ethnic institutes in Xinjiang and the Northwest, the ethnic public school in Qinghai, the two cadre schools in Ningxia and Xinjiang, as well as the ethnic department of Northwest University, the ethnic minority language department of Lanzhou University, and the ethnic minority art department of the Northwest Art Institute, with a total of more than 3,500 students in school. As for short-term training classes, they are opened at any time in various places according to work needs.
    (3) Unite, educate, and transform retained personnel and old intellectuals. For example, among the 1,701 ethnic minority cadres in Ningxia, 404 are retained personnel and old intellectuals who have been educated and transformed.
    Over the past two years, these cadres have played an extremely important role in publicizing and implementing policies, strengthening the connection between the party and the people's government and the masses, eliminating estrangement, strengthening ethnic unity, and mobilizing the masses to complete various tasks. Their general advantages are: active, enthusiastic, hard-working, sincere, and simple, especially familiar with the local situation, and have relatively close ties with the local masses. It is undeniable that many of them have a low level of education, especially some people who still have varying degrees of conservative and narrow views at the beginning, as well as the over-"left" and impetuous emotions shown by individual comrades after awakening. This is a product of history and can be overcome with education. Experience has proved that their progress in this area is very fast. All views that new ethnic minority cadres are "backward", "incapable", or take a contemptuous or attacking attitude on the grounds that they have "low cultural level" or "have not undergone work tests" are wrong.
    Over the past two years, the Communist Party organizations and people's governments at all levels have boldly and freely allowed ethnic minority cadres to carry out their work, and have relied on them everywhere. Starting from the point of view of cherishing them, they are not required too much at the beginning, or assigned tasks that cannot be completed; at the same time, they are patiently helped in their work, their specific guidance is strengthened, their difficulties are understood at all times, their emotions are carefully observed, their customs and habits are fully respected, and their difficulties in life and work are appropriately resolved to gradually increase their work confidence and work ability. Many areas have implemented the method of "apprenticeship". In the work, they are integrated with their lives and emotions, and they are consulted first, the policies are explained, the methods are explained, and they are asked to come forward (speeches, reports, etc.) to solve the problems. Work is seriously assigned to them, and their work is checked, and the policies and strategies are explained to them based on the specific problems they encounter, so as to continuously improve their policy level and work ability. Every small progress they make is welcomed and encouraged; their shortcomings should also be given sincere criticism in a timely manner, and they should be inspired to conduct self-criticism. All Han cadres must pay attention to actively uniting and helping ethnic minority cadres. If disunity occurs, Han cadres are generally primarily responsible. If there are errors in the work, Han cadres must first review themselves. In addition to completing the assigned work tasks (such as rent reduction, land reform), whether ethnic minority cadres have been trained in the work is also one of the main criteria for evaluating the merits of Han cadres.
    For the tendencies of Great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism remaining in Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres, a division of labor and cooperation method is implemented, with each focusing on reviewing themselves and appropriately helping others. The leadership first pays attention to overcoming the ideological tendencies of Great Han chauvinism, and the ideological tendencies of narrow nationalism that have already emerged should also be gradually overcome.
    Facts have proved that after doing so, not only has the unity between Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres become increasingly close, but also, through them, ethnic unity has been powerfully promoted. Not only can ethnic minority cadres complete their work tasks well and make rapid progress, but also Han cadres have been tempered and improved. Over the past two years, the large number of Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas have greatly improved in terms of understanding the feelings of ethnic minority people, understanding the ethnic situation, accumulating work experience, and mastering policies.
    In the future, in addition to paying attention to continuing to train and promote a large number of cadres in land reform and rent reduction in agricultural areas and various mass movements in pastoral areas, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership, overcome the tendency of dogmatism divorced from reality remaining in individual cadre schools, and vigorously run the existing schools for training ethnic minority cadres well; at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the education of existing cadres at all levels. This is the central link in training ethnic minority cadres in the Northwest region in the future, and we must strive to rotate and train existing cadres once within two years.
    (6) Finally, and most importantly, carry out the patriotic education movement of Resist America, Aid Korea. This is the driving force for strengthening ethnic unity and promoting the development of all work in ethnic minority areas. Since the launch of this movement in November 1950, after signing in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty, voting against the United States arming Japan, and the "May 1st" parade and demonstration, especially after the conclusion of patriotic covenants, increasing production and donating, and the reports of the delegation to North Korea and the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army, the large-scale patriotic movement of Resist America, Aid Korea has gradually spread and deepened from cities to rural areas, from agricultural areas to nomadic areas, and from traffic arteries to remote areas. Most of the ethnic minority people have been educated. For example, 80% of the total population of Xinjiang has been educated, and the patriotic education of the Tibetan Tianzhu Autonomous Region has been popularized throughout the region. As of now, most of the counties, cities, and banners with mixed ethnic groups and ethnic minority settlements have established branches of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, and have held one to several symposiums and representative meetings of Resist America, Aid Korea. In addition to the organization of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, Tianzhu Autonomous Region has also established a donation committee for the entire region and Resist America, Aid Korea groups in various townships, widely absorbing progressive people and activists to participate. On average, 1% of the people are working for Resist America, Aid Korea. Many people who are usually indifferent to politics have participated in patriotic activities.

    西北各民族人民两年来在毛泽东旗帜下团结前进
    ——在中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议上的发言摘要
    西北军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员  汪锋
    西北区五省一市除了汉族之外，还有维吾尔、回、藏、哈萨克、东乡、蒙古、柯尔克兹、土、撒拉、俄罗斯、乌孜别克、锡伯、塔塔尔、塔吉克、满、索伦十六个民族。共有人口六百三十余万，约占全西北人口的五分之一。
    这些民族，解放前都长期处于被压迫、被歧视的悲惨境地。由于历代反动统治阶级，特别是近数十年来国民党反动派——大汉族主义者的压迫剥削和挑拨离间，使民族之间，长期存在着严重的不团结状态，互相戒备，互相猜疑和仇视的心理很深。而各族内部也互有矛盾，纠纷很多。严重地影响着各族人民的团结和发展。迫使六百余万少数民族人民的政治、经济和文化生活，处于比汉族更加落后的状态。许多人经年流落在深山荒野之中，衣不蔽体，食不果腹，过着极为贫困的生活。
    解放以后，西北区的各级人民政府和人民解放军，根据共同纲领的民族政策，依照“慎重稳进”的方针，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导之下，团结了各民族各阶层的爱国民主人士，结成了一条极为广泛的民族民主统一战线，在少数民族地区，做了很多工作。两年来，经过清剿土匪，肃清特务，民族民主建政，培养干部，开展医疗、贸易工作，恢复和发展生产等一系列的实际工作，特别是经过抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动以后，民族之间和民族内部不仅实现了历史上空前的大团结，而且这种团结已获得进一步的加强，经济和文化生活也获得了初步改善，广大人民群众的政治觉悟已迅速提高，热爱祖国、热爱毛主席，已成为各族人民的坚定信念。现就几项主要工作，简报如下。
    （一）广泛深入地宣传民族政策；积极动员各族人民协助剿灭土匪，肃清特务，镇压反革命；主动地调解纠纷，消除隔阂，加强民族团结，安定社会秩序。在解放之初，虽然国民党反动政权已被推翻，但历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂，依然存在。残余的土匪特务，还在乘机煽惑，进行破坏。因此，当时各地都普遍地通过座谈会、联谊会、团结会、代表会等各种形式，向各阶层人民反复说明民族平等团结和宗教信仰自由的政策，揭破土匪特务的造谣欺骗。用具体事实说明团结是各族人民当前最大利益，号召各族人民起来积极协助人民解放军和地方公安部队剿灭土匪，肃清特务，镇压反革命分子。同时，主动地调解民族之间和民族内部的现存的各种纠纷。又配合中央访问团到西北各民族中访问，有计划地组织各民族代表人士到北京参加国庆大典和其他一些有关的会议，并到各大城市参观。而进入少数民族地区的汉族干部和人民解放军全体指战员，则严守纪律，尊重各民族人民的风俗习惯，时刻防止和克服大民族主义的思想残余，发扬艰苦奋斗作风，全心全意为各族人民服务。经过两年来的努力，西北边疆的股匪，已经基本消灭，剿匪工作取得了很大成绩，仅新疆一地两年来即消灭土匪四万五千余名，缴枪七千九百余支。匪首乌斯满、贾尼木汉等均已伏法。至于严重影响民族团结的各种纠纷，经过各级人民政府的主动调解，也已大大减少。两年来，全西北区根据民族平等团结的原则，经过民主协商方式，调解了的草山、水利、农牧、地界、婚姻等各种纠纷三千余件，仅甘肃临夏分区一地今年即调解了三百二十余件，青海同德县一年中即调解了三百余件，甘肃夏河县半年中即调解了二百六十余件。其中大者如青、甘交界的藏族甘甲和加吾部落的草山纠纷，新疆莎车和泽普、麦盖提和叶城的水利纠纷，昌吉汉族和哈萨克族的牧场纠纷，甘肃永昌县莎沟寺藏民和青海亹源县黄城滩回民间的牧户土地纠纷。这些纠纷有的存在了二、三十年，有的存在了四、五十年，甚至有百余年的。一旦解决，不仅消除了隔阂，增进了团结，而且教育了群众，大大提高了共产党和人民政府的威信。
    但我们绝不能因已有的成绩而骄傲自满。我们必须清楚地认识，少数民族地区的社会秩序虽然已经基本安定，但仍有少数残余散匪在继续抢劫破坏，个别牧区，人民政府的政策法令还未到达，工作还未展开；个别历史纠纷还未完全解决，新的纠纷，仍有发生；而靠近牧区的一些土匪特务，地主恶霸等反动分子，当农业地区减租、土地改革和镇压反革命运动深入之后，又企图乘隙潜入牧区，进行破坏活动。所以，在有匪患和社会秩序尚未完全安定的地方，仍要首先集中力量，肃清土匪特务，深入开展镇压反革命运动，继续大力调解纠纷，以求社会秩序完全安定，为民族团结扫除障碍。
    （二）积极认真推行区域自治和建立联合政权。依据民主集中制和人民代表会议制的基本原则，分别在民族聚居区推行区域自治，在民族杂居区建立联合政府，是少数民族人民多年来的愿望，也是实现民族平等团结的基本政策。西北区各级共产党的组织和人民政府，对此极为重视。
    在少数民族聚居区，已经推行了区域自治和建立了区以上自治机关的，计有东乡族聚居的东乡，蒙族聚居的阿拉善旗、额济纳旗和肃北地区，藏族聚居的卓尼、夏河、同德、天祝、武坪等地区。其余如青海的玉树专区和牧区各县，均正积极筹备，可望于一九五二年二月大体完成。新疆、甘肃、宁夏诸省，也正在依据本省少数民族聚居情况，结合各项实际工作，认真逐步地加以推行。应该说明，有许多少数民族聚居的区乡以至于县，虽然尚未宣布成立自治机关，但实际上都已由当地本民族干部负主要领导责任，许多工作人员也是本民族干部。如宁夏省的同心县，回民人口占百分之七十七，不但县长是回民，而一般干部也有一半是回民。
    新疆、甘肃、宁夏、青海、陕西五省，凡是民族杂居区，都普遍地建立了民族民主联合政府。各民族在政府中都大体有与其人口相适应的代表，并担负着主要责任或参加领导工作，而对人口特别少的民族则加以特别照顾。新疆、甘肃、青海、宁夏四省人民政府十六名正副主席和一百一十七名委员中，少数民族委员五十五名，其中任正副主席者六名，新疆省人民政府各厅、处及所辖十个专区（包括八十个县市）的区以上政权干部，百分之八十是当地民族干部。据一九五一年五月统计：青海、宁夏两省三十五个县市，回、藏、蒙等民族人士任正副县长的二十二人，甘肃临夏专区所辖六县一市中，有三个县的县长、两个县的副县长和一个市的市长，都是回民干部。青海共和县有一个哈萨克自治乡，人口虽然只有一百三十余人，但县人民政府委员名额中也有哈萨克族委员一名。这样就使各族人民在政权机关中，真正享受到平等的权利。
    各族各界的人民代表会议，无论杂居区或聚居区，都普遍地召开了一次至五次，部分地区并代行了人民代表大会职权。各族代表的产生，也都大体按照各族人口的比例，合理地分配了代表名额。如临夏县，汉族占人口的百分之五十二，回族占人口的百分之四十八，代表席位的比例，也大体与此相适应（汉族代表占百分之五十六，回族代表占百分之四十四）。而宁夏银川市第三届第一次各族各界人民代表会议的代表总数为二百一十一名，回民代表占四十三名，略高于回民所占银川市总人口的比例数。
    凡是根据民主集中制和人民代表会议制基本原则建立起来的区域自治机关或联合政府，都受到少数民族人民的普遍欢迎。无论在联系群众、推行政令以及培养干部、恢复和发展各族人民的政治经济文化上，都起了极大的推动作用。少数民族人民看见自己民族干部担任各级政权的负责领导工作，并用自己所喜好的形式，来管理本民族的事务，其兴奋程度是难以形容的。东乡建立自治区后，群众代表马九成高兴地说：“共产党把我们头上的石头砸碎了，我们抬起了头。多年受难无法生活的东乡人民，今天才见了太阳，这都是因为毛主席领导得好。”玉树分区三县，凡是听到关于推行民族区域自治宣传的人，无论男女老少都拍手称赞，很多人说：“我们藏民过去在反动政府的统治下，连个当卡长、科长的人都没有，今天我们选本民族的人当主席，自己管理自己的事，多少年来的愿望，今天实现了，这是毛主席领导的好处。”
    今后必须在少数民族聚居地区，普遍认真地推行区域自治，这是少数民族聚居区今后建政的中心，必须大力以赴，争取在一九五二、一九五三年内，将所有应该建立的自治机关都普遍建立起来。在已经建立了联合政府和推行了区域自治的地方，则应贯彻执行人民代表会议制度，使这一制度求得进一步的充实和健全。杂居区的联合政府，必须按照人口比例，适当配备各族干部，并应注意使各阶层人民在政权机关中，都有自己适当名额的代表参加。各级各族人民代表会必须定期召开，广泛吸收各阶层代表人物参加，讨论和决定当前各项重大问题，条件成熟时，即应代行人民代表大会职权，选举各级人民政府负责人员。务使人民代表会议，真正成为各级人民政府联系群众、推行政令以及各族人民实现自己管理自己事务的权力机关。
    其次，依据西北地区的具体情况和已有经验，必须有步骤地推行民族区域自治。在推行民族区域自治时，农业区必须结合减租、土地改革，牧区必须结合医疗、贸易以及其他实际工作。无论农牧区均须结合抗美援朝的爱国主义和国际主义教育运动。同时，应在自治机关建立之前，依据聚居的区域大小，成立不同规模的筹备机构，分别用推选、选举和聘请办法，广泛吸收各阶层有代表性的人士参加，积极推动有关建立自治政权的各项事宜，特别要在各阶层人民中，展开一个推行区域自治的宣传教育运动，酝酿协商自治区人民政府的人选。因为
    一般少数民族群众在开始时，对于推行区域自治，多缺乏正确认识，很多人误以为实行区域自治后共产党就要离开，怕“共产党的干部走了，没有政策怎么办”；而个别怀有狭隘民族主义思想情绪的人，则认为建立自治区后，就可以离开共产党和上级人民政府的领导，“独立”去干。所以，结合推行区域自治，对群众展开系统的宣传教育是十分必要的。推行区域自治的过程，就是教育和提高群众政治觉悟的过程。为了顺利推行区域自治，必须继续在汉族干部中防止和克服大民族主义思想残余（如认为“少数民族干部落后，不会办事，政权交给他们就会搞糟”等错误看法），对于少数民族干部中残存的狭隘民族主义思想倾向，也须适当防止和克服。经验证明：在推行区域自治问题上，消极拖延或束手束脚的态度是不对的，毫无准备毫无步骤或自流放任的态度，也是不对的。
    民族地区的政权组织形式，必须适合于各族当前政治经济发展阶段的情况，通过协商、酝酿，采取当地民族绝大多数人所熟习和乐意采取的形式，不能把汉族或农业区的一套区、乡、村制政权，机械地搬到少数民族地区或牧区去。牧区部落、千、百户和盟旗的组织形式，可在本民族人民同意的条件下，予以保存，逐渐充实以新民主主义内容。只有在民族民主的经济、政治和文化有了新的进一步的发展，需要用新的组织形式来代替现在已不适用的组织形式，并为广大人民及与群众有联系的领袖所自愿改变时，自然应当加以改变。新民主主义内容，必须通过民族形式，才能完满地顺利地实现。
    （三）开展贸易、医疗工作，恢复和发展农、牧民经济。解放以后，我们在少数民族地区坚决执行了公平合理的自由贸易政策，有意识地提高土产品的价格，减低工业品和土产品之间的剪刀差价，大批收购皮毛、药材等土产品，输送茶、布等日用必需品。据统计，皮毛等土产品价格和工业品价格比较，两年来一般相对地提高了一倍、十倍以至数十倍。如新疆小麦换卡叽布的比价，一九五一年比一九四九年提高到百分之四百。羊毛换卡叽布的比价，一九五一年比一九四九年提高到百分之一百八十。青海牧民用同样多的羊毛，今天所换得的布匹，要比解放前多十四倍半。宁夏蒙旗一九五一年五月驼毛换小麦的比率较解放前提高了三十八倍；仅青海一地国营贸易公司在一九五○年十月以前即收购羊毛八百二十四万斤，肠衣七万三千根及药材十六万斤，加上私商收购的羊毛（约一千万斤）共可折宽布五十万匹，而一九五○年十月至一九五一年七月即收购了价值五百五十六亿六千二百六十余万人民币的羊毛、药材和其他土产。这就大大增加了牧民的收入，提高了牧民的购买力。因而有许多牧区感觉到粮食供不应求，西宁礼帽销售量，一九五○年要比往年多出十倍以上。
    由于贸易公司坚持了团结私商和扶助正当工商业发展的政策，所以少数民族地区的工商业也在日益发展中。举如宁夏定远营由解放前的四十九户，发展到现在的二百九十九户。
    医疗卫生工作则由于从中央一直到各级人民政府的重视，亦获得巨大的成绩。总计解放后中央和西北区拨给少数民族的卫生专款合小米一千八百一十四万二千一百六十五斤，无代价发给的大批药品，约合小麦四百余万斤。
    为了开展少数民族地区的贸易医疗，除在各地广设贸易据点和专业机构（新疆、甘肃、宁夏、青海共有二百八十六个）以及卫生所、院之外，并特别有重点地组织贸易流动小组和派遣巡回医疗队深入农、牧区进行工作。根据不完全的统计，中央防疫第七大队和西北各级卫生机构及防疫队，从一九五○年十月到一九五一年六月，在少数民族地区共约诊病四十五万余人，种牛痘二十万人，防疫注射十万八千余人。
    这些贸易组或医疗队，在少数民族地区，不仅是一个贸易或医疗的机构，而且是共产党和人民政府在政治上的宣传者、组织者，是一个政治工作队。举如青海都兰贸易支公司组织的流动小组，到曲马莱、汪什代海贸易，不但完成了贸易任务，而且宣传了民族政策、税收政策和抗美援朝爱国主义思想，使群众的政治认识大大提高。又如，由于过去马步芳的民族挑拨政策，上下果落族闹不团结，经过贸易组的宣传，并配合党政干部的调解，两族团结了、友爱了。有时为了工作需要，两者又可混合组织，统一领导，统一行动，一面卖货，一面治病，一面宣传，一面组织，这是在牧区开展群众工作的一个很好的方式。因此，受到广大少数民族人民的热烈欢迎。但这些成功的经验，尚未为所有地区的党政干部所普遍重视，因而没有尽一切可能组织力量，去开展这一工作。今后必须在各级人民政府统一领导之下，各有关部门密切配合，组织一切可能组织的公私力量，在现有的基础上，进一步地向前发展。要组织更多的流动贸易小组和巡回医疗队，必要时则组织混合工作队，配合固定的贸易和医疗据点，深入农牧边远地区，将人民政府的各项政策，送到土房和帐房里去，并结合大力组织运输，重点建立集市，以加强贸易、医疗工作，发挥其在经济和政治上的应有作用。
    与此同时，我们又在牧区坚决执行了保护和扶助牧畜业发展的政策，除了防治兽疫外，并保护草原，改良水草，提倡储藏冬草，重点发放畜牧贷款，组织一切可能组织的（如运输、打猎、挖药材等）副业生产。在农业区则兴修水利，扩大种地面积，发放农贷，救济灾荒，组织劳动互助，增加粮食产量。根据不完全的统计，西北两年来共防疫注射和治疗了牲畜二百四十万头。仅新疆一地，两年来即治疗牲畜一百三十二万头，超过国民党时期十年治疗的总和。青海省在一九五一年防治病害虫运动中，仅湟源等四县据现有的统计，即打死瞎老鼠二十五万余只。该省牧区七个县的运输，挖药材等副业生产收入，据不完全统计，即获利达十三亿六千余万元。经过两年的努力，少数民族许多地区的农牧业，已经达到战前水平，部分地区并已超过了战前的生产水平。此外在各族农业区兴修水利、防疫、防虫都有显著成绩。但对我们的远大目标来说，这还不过是一个伟大的开始，今后还必须结合农牧区的实际情况，展开一个规模宏大的爱国增产运动，才能逐步根本改变少数民族人民经济生活的面貌。
    （四）有计划有步骤地恢复和发展文化教育事业。两年来，少数民族地区的文化教育已经初步恢复，部分地区较解放前并已有了较大发展。全西北区现共有少数民族中学二十七所，学生四千九百五十一人，小学二千二百一十四所，学生三十余万人。中小学学生较解放前增加了三分之一左右。仅新疆一地即有大、中、小学一千八百七十七所，较解放前增加了百分之三十二；学生二十九万八千五百余名，较解放前增加了百分之五十。宁夏回民小学生由一九五○年的八千九百一十三人，增加到一万零二百四十六人，较去年增加了百分之十五。定远营蒙文小学，由一九五○年的五十人增加至二百人。西安回民的大学生一九四九年只有十七人，一九五一年上半年即有三十四人；中学生一九四九年只有七十多人，一九五一年上半年即有一百一十余人；小学生增加的更多，一九四九年上半年只有六百零一人，一九五一年上半年就有一千四百三十七人，增加了百分之一百三十九以上。
    用少数民族文字出版的报纸、书籍，受到广大少数民族人民的热烈欢迎。全西北区已经有十七种用少数民族文字出版的报纸，每期发行总数在十万份以上。仅新疆一地即有用维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、俄罗斯、锡伯文字出版的十四种报纸。青海有一个藏文报。西北民族事务委员会有一个藏文报和蒙文报。不少地方已经建立了读报组，仅青海同仁县（藏族聚居区）即组织了一百一十三个藏文读报组，贵德县也组织了五十八个藏民读报组。广播事业已开始为各地所重视，新疆已建立了七个维吾尔、哈萨克、俄语的转播站。书籍的翻译和出版方面，截至一九五一年三月份止，新疆已译出八十三种维吾尔文书籍，三十八种哈萨克文书籍。共出版维吾尔哈萨克文书籍二十五种，十五万八千册。截至一九五一年十月份，毛主席的著作已译成维吾尔文的有五十八种（出版十种），哈萨克文的九种（出版四种），蒙文的一种。“毛泽东选集”出版后，新疆又专门组织了“毛泽东选集”翻译出版委员会，负责领导维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古文“毛泽东选集”的出版工作。
    在经济生活初步改善的基础上，各阶层人民学习文化的热情是很高的。一九五○年冬天、一九五一年春天，新疆、青海、宁夏三省的少数民族人民参加冬学的有三十二万八千八百人，仅新疆一地，一九五○年冬即成立冬学六千六百七十九所，入学的有二十五万六千余人。冬学结束后，转入常年民校学习的仅迪化一地即达两千七百余人。西安有六百以上的回民失学青年和成年，分别进入业余学校学习，两千多人参加了读报组。回民文化馆的业余文工团，经常有几十位回民青年在学习。连全市十一个清真寺的满拉们，也都组织起来学习文化和政治。
    配合医疗、贸易工作的开展和文工队的出演，为少数民族放映电影（还只是有重点地开始），这种“有声有色有形”的近代化艺术，受到少数民族观众的普遍欢迎，给他们扩大了新的眼界，提高了新的文化生活。
    少数民族的优良文化艺术传统，如新疆维吾尔、哈萨克族的舞蹈和歌唱，不仅受到他们本族人民的普遍欢迎和热爱，而且也受到了其他民族的欢迎。
    但应指出：我们这种努力，还远远赶不上少数民族人民的需要，特别是用少数民族文字出版的报纸书刊方面，更感缺乏；对少数民族的历史、文化和艺术传统的研究，还没有认真地、有计划地开始；中、小学的师资也是供不应求。对此，今后必须予以应有的重视。首先需要加强对现有少数民族文字报纸、书刊出版的领导，并调配和培养必要的人员，来加强这一方面的工作。急需一个通俗性的群众刊物。读报组应继续普遍组织。对少数民族历史文化和艺术的研究，也应有计划地集中人材，切实进行。对中、小学教师更须大量培养。
    （五）培养干部。这是做好少数民族地区一切工作的关键。两年来，西北在普遍大量培养和放手提拔使用的方针下，已经培养出一大批当地少数民族干部。不仅重视了一般干部的培养，而且也开始注意了少数民族高级干部和专业（如卫生、工业、贸易、公安、艺术、语文等）干部的培养。根据不完全的统计，全西北区现已有脱离生产的少数民族干部二万七千余名，如果再加上现在减租和土地改革以及其他工作中培养起来的干部，约有三万名左右。
    现有的两万七千名少数民族干部中，除了少部分是在内地革命或新疆三区革命中培养和锻炼起来的老干部或较老干部外，绝大多数都是解放以后新培养和提拔起来的。其主要来源有三：
    （1）从剿灭土匪、肃清特务、民主建政、抗美援朝、镇压反革命以及农业区的减租、反恶霸和牧区的各种群众运动中，提拔和培养起来的积极分子，占大多数。如新疆阿克苏区在改造乡村政权中，即培养和提拔了三千三百五十名当地民族干部。
    （2）从短期训练班和干部学校培养出来的学生。如新疆地方干部学校，从一九五○年三月到一九五
    一年八月，两期即毕业十三个民族的学生一千三百八十二人；现在在学校学习的，还有一千四百五十人。甘肃临夏干训班，十四次即训练了七百四十八名干部。目前培养少数民族干部的干部学校，计有新疆和西北的两个民族学院，青海的民族公学，宁夏和新疆的两个干部学校，以及西北大学的民族系，兰州大学的少数民族语文系，西北艺术学院的少数民族文艺系等，共计在校学生三千五百余人。至于短期训练班，各地则视工作需要，随时开办。
    （3）团结、教育、改造留职人员和旧知识分子。如宁夏一千七百零一名少数民族干部中，就有四百零四名是经过教育、改造的留职人员和旧知识分子。
    两年来，这些干部无论在宣传和执行政策方面，在加强党和人民政府和群众的联系方面，在消除隔阂加强民族团结方面，在发动群众完成各项任务方面，都起了极其重大的作用。他们的一般优点是：积极热情、吃苦耐劳、诚恳朴实，特别是熟悉当地情况，和当地群众有着比较密切的联系。不可否认，他们中间有许多人，文化程度低，特别是部分人在开始时还残留有程度不同的保守和狭隘观点，以及个别同志在觉悟后所表现的过“左”和急躁情绪。这是历史的产物，只要加强教育，就可以克服。经验证明，在这一方面，他们的进步是很快的。一切认为少数民族的新干部“落后”、“无能力”或藉口他们“文化低”、“没经过工作考验”而采取轻视或打击的态度都是不对的。
    两年来各级共产党组织和人民政府，大胆放手地让少数民族干部进行工作，处处通过并依靠他们。从爱护的观点出发，开始时对他们并不要求过高，或分配不能完成的任务；同时，在工作中耐心地帮助他们，加强对他们的具体指导，时时了解他们的困难，细心体察他们的情感，充分尊重他们的风俗习惯，适当解决他们生活和工作中的困难，逐渐提高其工作信心和工作能力。许多地区都实行了“带徒弟”的办法。在工作中，和他们的生活情感打成一片，遇事先和他们商量，讲明政策，说清办法，由他们出头露面（演讲、报告等），解决问题。认真向他们布置工作，并加强对他们的工作检查，根据他们所遇到的具体问题，给他们讲解政策、策略，不断提高他们的政策水平和办事能力。对他们每一个微小的进步，都表示欢迎，都给以鼓励；对他们的缺点，亦应适时地予以诚恳批评，并启发他们自己进行批评和自我批评。一切汉族干部，均须注意主动地团结和帮助少数民族干部，如果发生不团结现象，汉族干部一般须负主要责任。工作有了错误，汉族干部更须首先检讨自己。除完成指定的工作任务（如减租、土地改革）之外，是否在工作中培养了少数民族干部，也是考察汉族干部成绩好坏的主要标准之一。
    对于在汉族干部和少数民族干部中残留的大民族主义和狭隘民族主义思想倾向，则实行分工合作办法，各自着重检讨自己，并适当地帮助别人。领导方面首先注意克服大民族主义的思想倾向，对于已经露头的狭隘民族主义思想倾向，也应逐步地予以克服。
    事实证明，这样做了之后，不仅汉族干部和少数民族干部之间的团结日益亲密，而且经过他们，也有力地推动了各族人民之间的团结。不但少数民族干部可以很好地完成工作任务并进步很快，而且汉族干部也得到了锻炼和提高。两年来，在少数民族地区工作的大批汉族干部，无论在对少数民族人民情感的体会上，对民族情况的了解上，工作经验的积累上，以及政策的掌握上，都大大地提高了一步。
    今后，除了注意在农业区土地改革、减租以及牧区各项群众运动中，继续大量培养和提拔一批干部以外，还必须加强领导，克服残留在个别干部学校中脱离实际的教条主义倾向，大力办好现有的几个培养少数民族干部的学校；同时，须加强现有各级在职干部的教育。这是西北区今后培养少数民族干部的中心环节，必须争取在两年之内，将现有在职干部轮训一次。
    （六）最后而且最重要的，就是开展抗美援朝的爱国主义教育运动。这是加强民族团结推动少数民族地区一切工作向前发展的动力。从一九五零年十一月开始开展这一运动以来，经过拥护缔结和平公约签名，投票反对美国武装日本，“五一”游行示威，特别是经过订立爱国公约，增产捐献及赴朝慰问团和志愿军归国代表的报告，规模宏大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动，即逐步由城市向农村，由农业区向游牧区，由交通要道向偏僻区域普及和深入，大部分少数民族人民都已经受到了教育。如新疆受到教育的人占全省总人口的百分之八十，藏族天祝自治区的爱国主义教育则普及全区。截至目前为止，民族杂居和少数民族聚居的县、市、旗绝大部分都成立了抗美援朝分会，并召开了一至数次的抗美援朝座谈会、代表会。天祝自治区除了抗美援朝分会的组织以外，并成立了全区的捐献委员会、各乡的抗美援朝小组，广泛吸收进步人士和积极分子参加。平均有百分之一的人，为抗美援朝进行工作。许多平日对政治冷淡的人们，都参加了爱国主义的活动。有些宗教界的知名人士如班禅额尔德尼先生、青海喜饶嘉错副主席、塔尔寺夏茸尕布法台、甘肃拉卜楞寺贡唐仓嘉白样、青海西宁清真大寺教长买成章等，都曾为抗美援朝的爱国主义教育运动积极工作，不仅自己带头捐献，而且深入农牧区努力宣传，号召教民热爱祖国。青海宗教界组织宣传队赴各县清真寺、喇嘛寺和游牧区，进行抗美援朝宣传，对提高各族人民的爱国主义思想，起了很大作用。部分寺院（如塔尔寺）并成立了抗美援朝分会，积极推动这一工作。甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆四省成千成百的读报组，都以抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义和国际主义教育为中心内容进行活动。游牧区的医疗、贸易，农业区的土地改革、减租，以及农牧区的民族民主建政和发展生产、镇压反革命等各项实际工作，无不贯穿爱国主义的内容，而且通过医疗、贸易等各种工作内容和组织形式，使爱国主义运动逐渐向牧区和偏僻地区发展。同时，在爱国主义教育中，都普遍地联系了解放前后美帝国主义、国民党反动派——蒋介石马步芳匪帮及其残余势力土匪特务以及其他反革命分子的破坏民族团结，破坏宗教信仰自由，压迫剥削少数民族的罪恶，激起大家对美帝国主义及其走狗的憎恨和控诉。并以解放后民族平等团结、宗教信仰自由、经济、文化生活改善等活生生的事例，进行教育，以加强各族人民对祖国的热爱。
    因此，就使各族人民逐渐认识了美帝国主义是我们最凶恶的敌人，以苏联为首的各人民民主国家和全世界一切爱好和平的人民是我们最好的朋友，从而也就提高了各民族人民的政治觉悟，加强了民族团结，推动了各方面的工作。
    举如：新疆青河县八家户村蒙古、哈萨克族农民在公粮数字宣布后，一次就把公粮全部缴入仓库。南疆泽普县一区二乡三个村的农民争缴爱国公粮，并在粮仓前举行了一个一万余人的跳舞大会，有些老头子和老太婆也参加，尽情歌舞。青海化隆县四合村撒族农民，在抗美援朝运动中，订立了爱国公约，新开了一条二里长的水渠。工商界则踊跃交纳税款。如青海化隆县第三季度营业税仅一小时即超额缴纳完毕。都兰县在爱国主义的推动下，一九五
    一年的牧税，不仅提前完成了任务，而且超过了原布置的百分之九十二点九三。像新疆伊犁、塔城、阿山等三区，不到七十万人口，在捐献武器运动中，就认捐了八十亿人民币，五万只羊，两千匹马，两千条牛，八十头骆驼，四十万斤粗细粮。五万四千余人的甘肃天祝自治区，提前四十天完成了原订五个月捐献战斗机一架的计划。
    所有这些，就充分说明了广大少数民族人民，已把他们自己的命运和祖国的命运密切联系起来。他们认识了只有在毛主席、共产党领导的中华人民共和国里，各族人民才能有光明和幸福的前途。青海都兰县蒙民阿盖说得好：“不抗那美国杂种，如果让它占了朝鲜，把中国灭亡了，我们喝一包茶，又得三百斤羊毛。”
    但少数民族地区的抗美援朝运动的发展是不平衡的。一般的情况是：农村比城市差，游牧区比农业区差，偏僻区域比交通要道差。同时，在制订爱国公约以及捐献运动中，个别地区还存在着命令主义和形式主义。而有些地方的爱国主义的教育运动，还没有很好和当地的民族特点及实际情况结合起来，或者把它当成“突击任务”，不能很好地坚持和巩固下去。
    因此，西北区民族工作的任务，就在于以继续普及和深入抗美援朝的爱国主义教育为中心，普遍认真地积极推行区域自治，充实联合政府，更好地结合当地民族特点和清剿土匪，肃清特务，镇压反革命，调解纠纷，开展医疗、贸易，恢复和发展经济、文化以及农业区的减租、土地改革等各项实际工作，普遍推行爱国公约，克服各种不正确思想和工作中的形式主义、命令主义。特别注意游牧区和边远地区爱国主义运动的开展，以便改变目前爱国主义运动的不平衡状态，并从而把农牧区的各项工作推向前进，更进一步巩固和加强民族团结。为此，就必须百倍地加强少数民族地区的群众工作。各级党政领导机关，都须把十分之九的力量，用在群众工作上面，不但在土地改革、减租工作上要依靠和发动本民族群众，就是在推行区域自治和其他一切工作上，也必须依靠和发动本民族群众。只有本民族群众政治觉悟的不断提高，只有本民族干部的大量涌现并在政治上达于成熟，各族人民的团结和发展事业，才能获得更加巩固的基础。
    让我们在毛泽东的旗帜下继续奋勇前进吧！
    毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    全国各族人民牢不可破的大团结万岁！
