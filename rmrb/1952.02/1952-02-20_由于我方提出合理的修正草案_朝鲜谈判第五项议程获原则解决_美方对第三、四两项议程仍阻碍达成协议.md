Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th - At the plenary session of the Korean armistice talks delegations on the 19th, our representative pointed out: "We have carefully studied your side's statement on our amended draft on the 17th. I must point out that the stumbling block hindering the complete agreement on the third and fourth agenda items is created by your side. Now that the fifth agenda item has been resolved in principle due to the reasonable amended draft proposed by our side, your side should not persist in your unreasonable claims and demands on the third and fourth agenda items, delaying the arrival of the Korean armistice. Our side's draft in principle for the fifth agenda item is very clear and allows for no misunderstanding. The 'relevant governments on both sides' used in our draft in principle naturally refers to the relevant governments on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army side, and the relevant governments on the United Nations Command side. The 'foreign troops' used in our draft in principle naturally refers to 'non-Korean troops'. The meaning of 'and other issues' used in our draft in principle is also very clear; it neither restricts the future political conference from discussing certain specific issues, nor does it exclude the possibility of this political conference discussing other issues. I propose that the work of drafting the details of the fifth agenda item be handed over to the staff officers. The time for the staff meeting will be determined by the liaison officers of both sides."

    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, our side once again pointed out that the other side themselves know that they cannot provide any reason, nor is there any reason to oppose any of the neutral countries proposed by our side. The other side's unreasonably opposing our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral country can only be interpreted as deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations. Our side once again requested the other side to seriously reconsider our proposal, withdraw its unreasonable opposition, and accept our completely reasonable solutions on the rotation quota and specific rear port issues.

    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, both sides continued to exchange views on our amended draft of February 14 and the amended wording proposed by our side on February 16 and 18.

    由于我方提出合理的修正草案
    朝鲜谈判第五项议程获原则解决
    美方对第三、四两项议程仍阻碍达成协议
    【新华社开城十九日电】十九日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方代表指出：“我们仔细研究了十七日你方对于我方修正草案的发言，我必须指出阻碍三、四两项议程达成全部协议的绊脚石是你方制造的。第五项议程既已因我方提出的合理的修正草案而获得原则解决，你方就更不应该再坚持你方在三、四两项议程上的无理主张与要求，迟延朝鲜停战的到来。我方对于第五项议程的原则草案，本身是非常清楚的，不容任何误解。我方原则草案中所用的‘双方有关各国政府’，自然就是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面的有关各国政府，和联合国军方面的有关各国政府。我方原则草案中所用的‘外国军队’自然就是‘非朝鲜军队’。我方原则草案中所用的‘等问题’的意义，也是很清楚的，它既不约束将来的政治会议讨论某些特定问题，也不排除这一政治会议讨论其他问题的可能。我提议将草拟第五项议程条文细节的工作交由参谋人员进行。参谋会议何时举行，由双方联络官商定。”
    第三项议程参谋会议上，我方再次指出对方自己也知道提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由反对我方所提出的中立国家中任何一个国家。对方避不讲理地反对我方提名苏联为中立国只能被解释为有意拖延停战谈判。我方再次要求对方重新严重考虑我方的建议，撤回其无理的反对，并接受我方对于轮换限额和特定后方口岸问题上的完全合理的解决方案。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方就我方二月十四日修正草案及我方在二月十六日及十八日先后提出的修正措辞继续交换意见。
