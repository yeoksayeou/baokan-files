Unscrupulous Capitalists Try Every Possible Means to Sabotage the National Customs
Customs Staff Actively Participate in the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Theft Struggle and Resolutely Fight Back

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in customs offices across the country has been widely launched, and a firm counterattack has been launched against the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive.

The customs is the gateway to the country and plays an extremely important role in safeguarding national economic sovereignty.

However, for the past three years, the bourgeoisie has used various methods to sabotage our customs. They have adopted despicable and shameless means such as treating to meals, giving gifts, lending money, offering bribes, buying shares, sharing profits, pulling old connections, sending "spies," and even inducing drug addiction to entice customs personnel to achieve their sinister goal of stealing national wealth and obtaining illegal profits. Under the rampant offensive of the bourgeoisie, corruption in various customs offices is very serious. The customs in South China, near Hong Kong and Macau, and the South China Customs Office are particularly serious. It has also been discovered that many customs personnel in various customs offices are direct shareholders or behind-the-scenes figures in import and export trading companies, and some often do business together.

The bourgeoisie's offensive against the customs is mainly carried out in the following three aspects, in addition to generally stealing national property in construction, procurement, and material storage:

First, smuggling. From January 1950 to November 1951, customs offices across the country investigated more than 60,000 smuggling cases, and the smuggled goods found alone were worth several hundred billion yuan. It is estimated that those not found were worth tens of thousands of billions of yuan. Smuggled imports are all luxury goods that we are not allowed to import or things that are already produced domestically; smuggled exports are all strategic materials or important necessities that we are not allowed to export. Except for some sporadic smuggling, all major cases are planned crimes by the bourgeoisie. For example, Zeng Qitao, a treacherous merchant from the Dechang Customs Brokerage in Guangzhou, bribed Liang Dehui, the director of the Huangsha Railway Station Office of the Guangzhou Customs, and others to smuggle tin (one of the materials prohibited from export). A total of 270,000 kilograms were smuggled. Pan Hui, a private inspector of the Wenzhou branch customs, was bought by a merchant, embezzled more than 7 million yuan, and let go of smuggled goods worth more than 136 million yuan. Pan Yupu, a customs inspector at Guangzhou Customs, accepted bribes of 80 million yuan from smugglers, and the value of the smuggled goods he let go of is incalculable. More seriously, this kind of smuggling not only steals a large amount of national property, but also directly helps the Kuomintang remnant bandits and imperialism.

Second, tax evasion. Many cases of collusion between treacherous merchants and some customs personnel to evade taxes by underestimating the value of goods, deliberately misclassifying tariff categories, or forging documents have been discovered in various places. For example, Lian Huisheng, a staff member of the Tianjin Customs, often underestimated the prices of imported goods to evade taxes, accepting bribes of more than 76 million yuan, causing the state to lose more than 1.2 billion yuan in tax revenue. Shen Zenglong, a supervisor at Qingdao Customs, has consistently engaged in corruption and bribery, leaking secrets and providing information, and assisting private merchants, embezzling 17 million yuan. Therefore, the losses suffered by the state are even more impossible to calculate. Wang Dajun, a chemist at Tianjin Customs, falsely certified substandard diesel as qualified, accepting a bribe of 10 million yuan, causing a tax loss of 230 million yuan. On the other hand, unscrupulous capitalists have violated customs regulations and sabotaged foreign trade control laws in many ways.

Third, stealing secrets. There are also many cases in this area. For example, Bian Dingsun, the former chief secretary of the Tariff Commission of the General Administration of Customs, used his position to steal new tariff secrets and told merchants in Hong Kong in code. Cao Guibo, a clerk at Tianjin Customs, was bought by a treacherous merchant and privately made an extra copy of the "Provisional Measures and Detailed Rules for Barter Trade Management Appendix Draft," which had not yet been announced, and gave it to the treacherous merchant, causing incalculable losses to the state.

These serious facts cannot but arouse our high vigilance. Some customs cadres in certain areas still have right-leaning paralysis in underestimating the extent of corruption and should be corrected quickly in order to further deepen the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and thoroughly investigate all corrupt elements; in particular, large corrupt elements should be immediately surrounded and suppressed. It is necessary to liquidate bourgeois ideology, thoroughly eliminate the illegal acts of the bourgeoisie colluding with customs personnel, engaging in smuggling, tax evasion, exchange evasion, exchange speculation, and fraud, and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive against the new China's customs!

    不法资本家千方百计破坏国家的海关
    海关工作人员积极参加反贪污反盗窃斗争予以坚决反击
    全国海关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已普遍发动起来，对资产阶级的猖狂进攻进行了坚决的回击。
    海关是国家的门户，在保卫国家经济主权上有极为重要的作用。
    可是，三年来，资产阶级却用了种种办法破坏我们的海关。他们采取请客、送礼、借钱、行贿、入股、分红、拉旧关系、派“坐探”以至诱吸毒品等卑鄙无耻的手段，勾引海关人员，以达到他们偷盗国家资财获取非法暴利的罪恶目的。在资产阶级的猖狂进攻下，各海关贪污现象十分严重。邻近港澳的华南各关及华南海关处，贪污现象特别严重。各海关并发现不少海关人员直接是进出口贸易行的股东或幕后人物，有些经常搭配做生意。
    资产阶级向海关的进攻，除一般地在修建、采购、保管物资等方面偷盗国家资财外，主要是从以下三方面进行：
    一、进行走私。自一九五○年一月至一九五一年十一月，全国海关查获的走私案件共有六万多起，仅仅查到的私货就值几千亿元，没有查到的估计在几万亿元以上。走私进口的都是些我们不准进口的奢侈品或国内已有出产的东西；走私出口的则都是些我们不准出口的战略物资或重要必需品。除一些零星走私外，所有重大案件都是资产阶级有计划的犯罪行为。如广州市德昌报关行奸商曾其滔，贿赂广州海关黄沙车站办事处主任梁德辉等数人，偷运锡（禁止出口的物资之一）出口，前后共有二十七万公斤。温州支关查私员潘辉，为商人收买，贪污七百多万元，放走的私货值一亿三千六百多万元。广州海关验货员潘雨浦受走私商人的贿赂八千万元，放走的私货价值无法估计。更严重的是，这种走私不仅偷盗国家大量财产，而且是直接帮助了国民党残余匪帮和帝国主义。
    二、偷漏关税。奸商串通一些海关工作人员，以低估货价或故意把税则分类列错，或伪造单证以偷漏关税的案件，各地发现了很多。如天津海关工作人员廉惠生对进口货经常低估价格偷税，先后受贿七千六百多万元，使国家损失税款十二亿多元。青岛海关监管员沈增龙，一贯贪污受贿，泄密报信，协助私商，贪污一千七百万元。因此国家所遭受的损失，更无法统计。天津海关化验员王大均，以不及格柴油为及格，受贿一千万元，使税款损失二亿三千万元。另一方面，不法资本家更多方违犯海关章则和破坏对外贸易管制法令。
    三、窃取机密。这方面的案件也很多。如海关总署前税则委员会主任秘书卞鼎孙，利用职权，窃取新税则机密，用暗语告诉香港商人。天津海关有一个办事员曹贵波，被奸商收买，把还没公布的“易货贸易管理暂行办法及细则附表草案”私自多打一份送给奸商，使国家遭受无可计量的损失。
    这些严重的事实，不能不引起我们高度的警惕。某些地区的海关干部，还有对贪污情况估计不足的右倾麻痹思想，应迅速纠正，以便更进一步地深入展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，彻底追查一切贪污分子；特别是应对大贪污分子应即展开围剿。要清算资产阶级思想，彻底肃清资产阶级勾引串通海关工作人员，实行走私、漏税、逃汇、套汇、诈欺等不法行为，坚决打退资产阶级向新中国海关的猖狂进攻！    （蔡渭洲）
