Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the direct organs of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, units under the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, and various organs in Wuhan City has shifted to the stage of besieging major embezzlers. From mid-January to now, over twenty days, almost all staff in organs in the Central-South District and Wuhan City have been swept up in the anti-corruption struggle. From the start of the anti-corruption struggle, each organ, based on changes in the thinking of the masses, repeatedly explained the policies, enabling the masses to dare to confess and report. This allowed all materials related to embezzlement or similar activities to be fully exposed. Then, the masses were guided to analyze the materials, distinguishing between major and minor embezzlement, as well as the boundary between embezzlement and waste. At the same time, a group of minor embezzlers who voluntarily confessed were dealt with promptly. This relieved those who mixed public and private affairs and minor embezzlers of their burdens, allowing them to advance to the front lines with light packs, strengthening the fighting ranks and concentrating firepower to attack major embezzlers. The General Office of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central-South District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation achieved results by doing this. In order to correct the paralysis among some cadres in the trade, finance, and economic systems who were satisfied with existing achievements, the units held continuous meetings of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the masses from January 28th to 31st, severely criticizing the idea that the movement was "almost over."

The larger the embezzlement case, the more concealed it is, and the more difficult it is for embezzlers to confess. In response to this situation, each organ universally organized inspection teams to clear accounts, check materials, and conduct extensive investigations with relevant parties, leaving "tigers" with nowhere to hide. The Trade Department of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central-South District Branch of the People's Bank of China have both transferred a large number of cadres with clean hands to participate in the inspection work of the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan City. The Central-South District Branch has also organized three inspection teams to respectively inspect the accounts of the bank's general affairs operations, as well as the accounts of the Wuhan Branch of the Bank of China and the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China, which have more contact with the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan City. More than 20 cadres from the agricultural tax section of the Central-South Finance Department, where the anti-corruption struggle ended earlier, have formed an inspection team to assist the grain administration, a key unit of the department, in carrying out the anti-corruption movement. The Central-South District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation dispatched four inspection teams to focus on inspecting the accounts of the company's first and second warehouses and private cotton firms that had frequent dealings with them. The Central-South District Companies of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the Animal Products Corporation also paid attention to educating the families of major embezzlers who had been discovered, and have achieved results. Due to intensified encirclement and suppression, in the past week, several large "tigers" who embezzled around 100 million yuan have been captured. Units severely punished those who had solid evidence but refused to confess. At a confession and reporting meeting, the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China announced the dismissal of two embezzlers who were reported but refused to thoroughly confess and repent, and sent a major embezzler named Zhang Xingfang to the court, which prompted many embezzlers to confess on the spot, creating a climax in the bank's anti-corruption movement.

Because the vast majority of major embezzlers have direct contact with industrialists and merchants, and some have formed "alliances of offense and defense" with illegal merchants, each organ has also transferred a large number of cadres to assist the industrial and commercial circles in carrying out the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-theft, and anti-tax evasion movement, analyzing and handling the reported materials at any time, and besieging and suppressing major embezzlement and illegal activities of the bourgeoisie.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 4th: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the first-level organs of the Southwest District and Chongqing City has entered the stage of concentrating firepower on major embezzlers and launching a general offensive. According to estimates by the Economy and Thrift Inspection Committee of the first-level organs of the Southwest District and the Economy and Thrift Inspection Committee of Chongqing City, most of the general medium and small embezzlers in various organs have been reported or voluntarily confessed, and the focus of the mass struggle has shifted to major embezzlement cases. According to incomplete statistics from municipal-level organs, as of the end of January, a total of about 30 major embezzlement cases involving more than 50 million yuan have been exposed. Because major embezzlement cases are being cracked one after another, the enthusiasm of the masses is leading to a new climax. In order to thoroughly eliminate the hidden major embezzlers in various organs, the first-level organs of the Southwest District and Chongqing City plan to take the following measures: (1) Each organ shall be responsible by its leaders to set a deadline, quickly organize forces, and adopt the method of special personnel in charge and special case handling to launch a fierce offensive against major embezzlers; (2) Quickly handle the medium and small embezzlers who have confessed within a short period of time, and organize these people into the movement to attack major embezzlers; (3) A few organs that have not fully mobilized the masses or are still stagnant in inspecting leadership should quickly complete the task of inspecting leadership and general confession and reporting, and not delay the time to attack major embezzlers; (4) If clues to major embezzlement are found, they must be tracked down and surrounded from the inside and outside, layer by layer. In order to implement attacks from the inside and outside, Chongqing City has organized more than 3,000 students and cadres, divided into ten inspection brigades, to simultaneously conduct inspections of illegal merchants.

Before the start of the battle to besiege the "big tigers," leading cadres of various organs made in-depth self-criticisms to the masses. As the movement deepened and the awareness of the masses increased, everyone provided a lot of materials about the serious bureaucratic phenomena existing in the organs. This timely self-criticism further solved the problems existing in the leadership, so that the leadership and the masses could concentrate their efforts to attack major embezzlers. The Municipal People's Government Education Bureau originally believed that there could not be major embezzlement cases in educational institutions, but after the bureau's leadership repeatedly organized forces, it finally discovered embezzlement cases involving more than 100 million yuan. Recently, embezzlement cases involving more than 50 million yuan have also been cracked in various middle schools.

    中南区和武汉市、西南区和重庆市  
    围攻大贪污犯的战斗猛烈展开  
    同时组织力量对不法商人进行检查
    【新华社汉口三日电】中共中央中南局直属机关、中南军政委员会所属单位、武汉市各机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已转向大贪污犯围剿的阶段。从一月中旬到现在二十多天，中南区和武汉市所有机关的工作人员几全部卷入反贪污斗争浪潮。反贪污斗争一开始，各机关即根据群众的思想变化，反复交代政策，使群众敢于坦白和检举，让所有贪污或类似贪污的材料都充分暴露，然后引导群众分析材料划清大小贪污，以及贪污和浪费的界线，同时及时处理一批自动坦白的小贪污分子，这样公私不分者和小贪污分子都解除包袱，轻装上前线，壮大了战斗队伍，集中火力向大贪污分子进攻。中南军政委员会办公厅、中国花纱布公司中南区公司等单位这样做都获得了战果。贸易、财政、经济等系统的各单位，为了纠正有些干部满足于既有成绩的麻痹思想，从一月二十八日到三十一日，连续召开了共产党员、青年团员和群众大会，严厉地批判了认为运动“差不多了”的思想。
    贪污案件越大，就越隐蔽，贪污分子越不容易坦白。针对这种情况，各机关普遍组织了检查组，清理账目，查点物资，向有关方面广泛进行调查，使“老虎”无处藏身。中南军政委员会贸易部和中国人民银行中南区行都已调集了大批手脚干净的干部参加对武汉市工商界的检查工作，中南区行并组织了三个检查组分别检查该行经营总务方面的账目，以及和武汉市工商界联系较多的中国银行武汉分行、人民银行武汉分行的账目。中南财政部反贪污斗争结束较早的农业税处干部二十多人，已组成检查组前往该部的重点单位粮食管理局协助开展反贪污运动。中国花纱布公司中南区公司派出了四个检查组，重点检查该公司所属第一、第二仓库和与之往来较多的私营棉花商号的账目。中国花纱布、畜产两公司的中南区公司对已发现的大贪污犯的家属，也注意进行教育工作，并已收到成效。由于加紧围剿，最近一周内已有贪污一亿元左右的大“老虎”多只落网。各单位对证据确凿而拒不坦白者便严惩。人民银行武汉分行在一次坦白检举大会上将两个被检举又不肯彻底坦白反省的贪污分子宣布撤职，将一个大贪污犯张行方送交法院后，促使许多贪污分子当场坦白，造成了该行反贪污运动的高潮。
    由于绝大部分大贪污犯和工商业者有直接联系，有的和不法商人订立了“攻守同盟”，因此各机关又抽调了大批干部协助工商界开展反行贿、反欺诈、反盗窃、反偷漏运动，随时分析处理已经检举出来的材料，向大贪污以及资产阶级的不法行为进行围剿。
    【新华社重庆四日电】西南区一级机关和重庆市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已进入向大贪污犯集中火力，发起总攻击的阶段。据西南区一级机关节约检查委员会和重庆市节约检查委员会的估计，各机关的一般中、小贪污分子大多数已被检举或自动坦白，群众斗争锋芒已转向大贪污案件。据市级机关不完全的统计，截至一月底止，已揭发的五千万元以上的大贪污案件共达三十件左右。因为大贪污案件的陆续破获，群众的热情正引向新的高潮。为彻底肃清各机关隐藏的大贪污分子，西南区一级和重庆市级各机关拟采取下列办法：（一）各机关由首长负责，限定期限，迅速组织力量，采取专人负责，专案办理的办法，向大贪污犯展开猛烈的进攻；（二）在短期内迅速处理已坦白的中、小贪污分子，把这些人组织到运动中来向大贪污犯进攻；（三）少数尚未充分发动群众或仍停滞在检查领导的机关，应迅速完成检查领导和一般坦白、检举的任务，不许拖延向大贪污犯进攻的时间；（四）发现大贪污的线索，就要跟踪追击，内外夹攻，层层包围。为实行内外夹击，重庆市已组织三千多学生和干部，分成十个检查大队，同时向不法商人进行检查。
    在围攻“大老虎”的攻坚战开始之前，各机关的领导干部都又向群众作了深入的检讨。由于运动深入，群众觉悟提高，大家对机关中所存在的严重官僚主义现象又提供了许多材料。这种适时的检讨进一步解决了领导方面存在的问题，使领导和群众都能集中力量向大贪污犯进攻。市人民政府教育局原先认为教育机关不可能有大贪污案件，但经该局领导方面反复组织力量，终于发现亿元以上贪污案件。最近各中等学校中也破获了上五千万元的贪污案件。
