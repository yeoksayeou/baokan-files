    Tibetan Girl - Haha
    Haha is a fifteen-year-old Tibetan girl. Her family has a total of three people, without any land, making a living by selling water. Before liberation, they didn't have enough to eat for eight out of ten days. After liberation, she carried water for the county people's government and could earn ten silver dollars a month, and the whole family lived well.
    When the People's Liberation Army's troops stationed in her hometown, Haha quickly became acquainted with the comrades. When she had time, she would find the female comrades in the team headquarters to learn to sing, recognize characters, and learn Chinese. Haha has already joined the Women's Federation. She studies very actively. The walls, beds, stoves, and wooden boxes for holding tsampa in her home have all become Haha's study notebooks. She writes the words "Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army are saviors" particularly neatly. Haha often participates in entertainment evenings with the female comrades of the troops and has learned a lot of revolutionary knowledge. Among the women, she has become an active propagandist. Sometimes, while carrying water, she would pantingly explain the principle that "Chairman Mao is the savior and the People's Liberation Army is the benefactor" to other Tibetan compatriots.
    In June of last year, she voluntarily brought a month's worth of tsampa and ghee and, along with other Tibetans, cooperated with the troops to carry out construction tasks in a certain area of the Kangzang Plateau. Although she was still young, she was a good worker. She insisted on working eight hours a day with everyone. Once, she accidentally stumbled over a stone while transporting soil, and her thigh and arm were injured. She said, "In order to complete the construction task and build and consolidate the border, it doesn't matter if I shed a little blood!"
    The busy farming season arrived, and the golden highland barley was everywhere. The superiors mobilized the Tibetan compatriots who participated in the construction task to return home to produce and gave each person twenty silver dollars. Haha cried when she heard the news. She said, "The construction task has not been completed yet, asking me to go home is looking down on me." After the comrades explained, she understood. But she resolutely refused to accept the twenty silver dollars. She said that her family was living well and that she wanted to donate the money to the country to buy airplanes and cannons to fight the American devils. In the end, the comrades had to buy gifts with the money and send them to Haha's home.
    Young Haha loves the motherland and loves the great people's leader Chairman Mao. She patted her chest and said to people, "In another two years, when I grow taller, I will join the People's Liberation Army and strive to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao."

    藏族少女——哈哈
    哈哈，是一个十五岁的藏族小姑娘。她家共有三口人，没有一点地，靠卖水为生。解放前，他们十天有八天不够吃。解放以后，她给县人民政府背水，每月可以收入十块银元，全家生活得满好。
    人民解放军进藏部队在她家乡住扎，哈哈很快地就和同志们熟识了。她有空就找队部的女同志学唱歌、认字、学汉话。哈哈已经参加了妇女会。她学习非常积极。家里的墙壁、床铺、锅台、盛?粑的木箱，都变成了哈哈的学习本。“毛主席、解放军是救星”这几个字，她写得特别端正，哈哈经常和部队女同志一起参加娱乐晚会，学会了很多革命的知识。在妇女中间，她成了一个积极的宣传员。有时她背着水，还气吁吁地给别的藏族同胞讲“毛主席是救星，解放军是恩人”的道理。
    去年六月间，她自愿带着一个月的?粑和酥油，和其他藏民，配合部队，进行康藏高原某地的修建任务。虽然她年纪还小，但做起工来可是好样的。她天天和大家一起坚持八个钟头的工作。有一次，她运土时不小心，被石头绊倒了，她的大腿和胳膊负了伤。她说：“为了完成修建任务，建设和巩固边疆，我流点血算不了什么！”
    农忙季节到来了，遍地是金黄色的青稞麦，上级动员参加修建任务的藏族同胞回家生产，并每人发给二十块银元。哈哈听说这个消息，哭起来了。她说：“修建任务还没完成，叫我回家是看不起我。”经过同志们解释后，她才想通了。但是她坚决不收那二十块银元。她说，家里生活很好，她要把这些钱捐给国家，买飞机大炮，打美国鬼子。最后，同志们只好把这些钱买成礼物，送到哈哈家里。
    年青的哈哈热爱着祖国，热爱着伟大的人民领袖毛主席，她拍着胸脯对人说：“再过两年，个子长高了，参加人民解放军，争取上北京去看毛主席。”
