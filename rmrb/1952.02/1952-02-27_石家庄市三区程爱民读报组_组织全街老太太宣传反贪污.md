    Shijiazhuang City Third District Cheng Aimin Reading Group
    Organizes Elderly Women in the Neighborhood to Publicize the Anti-Corruption Campaign
    Editor: The members of the Cheng Aimin Reading Group in the Third Street of the Third District of Shijiazhuang City are mostly elderly women. They are very enthusiastic about reading the newspaper. After the anti-corruption movement started, Cheng Aimin led everyone to read the newspaper at night, and during the day, she organized more than fifty elderly women in the neighborhood into a propaganda team to carry out publicity. They also composed many quick rhythmic verses (Kuaiban), one of which goes like this: "We old ladies are old, we cannot carry stretchers for the wounded of the Volunteer Army; we engage in the 'Three-Anti' campaign in the rear, determined to eliminate big bad capitalist merchants." Another example: "The hearts of capitalist merchants are vicious, accurately targeting bad cadres, bribery, harboring sinister motives, making the cadres obedient and subservient to them, and thus they make a fortune! Hey capitalist merchant, listen up: if you don't confess, I'll report you, there's plenty of material from all directions." Their quick rhythmic verse plays are vivid and moving, greatly touching the masses. Many old ladies automatically requested to join the ranks of propaganda. In front of private factories and shops, they focused on explaining the policies; among the citizens, they publicized the principles of anti-corruption. In the evening, everyone returned to the reading group to report on the situations and materials they learned during the day's publicity, and provide them as reference for the district's savings inspection team.

    石家庄市三区程爱民读报组
    组织全街老太太宣传反贪污
    编辑同志：石家庄市三区三街程爱民读报组的组员，大多数是老太太。她们读报的热情很高。反贪污运动开始后，程爱民在晚上领导大家读报，白天又把全街五十多位老太太，组成一个宣传大队，进行宣传。她们还编了许多快板，有一个快板是这样说的：“老太太年纪大，不能给志愿军伤员抬担架；咱在后方搞‘三反’，决心肃清奸商大坏蛋。”又如：“奸商心眼狠，把坏干部打个准，行贿赂，怀鬼胎，干部给他搞得乖又乖，他们因此发横财！叫奸商，你听着：你不坦白我要告，四面八方有的是材料。”她们演的快板剧，有声有色，群众大为感动。许多老太太自动要求参加宣传的行列。在私营工厂和商店门前，她们着重说明政策；在市民中则宣传反贪污的道理。晚上，大家回到读报组里汇报一天宣传中所了解的情况和材料，并供给本区的节约检查组参考。  石家庄日报  柳木风
