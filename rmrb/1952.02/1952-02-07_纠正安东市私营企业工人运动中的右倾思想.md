    Correcting Right-Leaning Thought in the Workers' Movement of Private Enterprises in Andong City
    Zhang Lie, Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    (I) There are Serious Problems in Labor-Capital Relations in Private Enterprises in Andong City

    Currently, there are quite serious problems in labor-capital relations in private enterprises in Andong City. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, the bourgeoisie are seriously violating government laws and decrees and attacking workers; on the other hand, the leadership of the workers' movement has been ineffective, failing to fully mobilize and lead the worker masses to carry out resolute struggles, resulting in ideological confusion and organizational disarray among some workers.

    Some capitalists, taking advantage of the difficult living conditions of employees and their eagerness to return to work, refuse to rehire Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, trade union cadres, and activists on the pretext that their business situation is not good. To achieve this goal, capitalists have adopted many despicable means: some buy off a few backward workers to refuse the rehiring of trade union cadres; some specifically look for minor shortcomings of Party members, League members, and trade union cadres as excuses to refuse rehiring; and for those Party members, League members, and trade union activists who are eager to return to work, they first use threats before allowing them to return to work.

    Some capitalists use methods like sharing dividends through stock ownership to paralyze the class consciousness of workers and restrict their political activities in order to evade the constraints of government laws and decrees. Some capitalists, after deceiving workers into buying shares, say to the workers: "We are not in a labor-capital relationship. Everyone opens a factory, and I am an employee. In order to get more money, we cannot have public holidays in the future, no overtime pay, and no improvement in living conditions." When trade union cadres go to organize workers to join the trade union, he says: "We are all owners." When the Labor Bureau orders him to implement the system of public holidays, he says: "Everyone doesn't want public holidays."

    Some, in order to pursue excessive profits, disregard the health of workers, excessively extend working hours, and work overtime; fail to improve safety and health equipment; value machines more than people, resulting in serious casualties, overwork, and chronic illnesses. For example: Taifeng Paper Mill used a bone-steaming pot instead of a material-steaming pot, resulting in the explosion of the steaming pot and the scalding death of two workers; a worker at Xiemao Paper Mill died from overwork and illness. During his rest period, the capitalist stopped paying his salary. This worker went to work while ill, and died from overwork; Tianxiangyi Pharmacy's manager forced worker Liu Jialin to his death; at Hechang Paper Mill, due to failure to improve safety and health equipment and labor conditions, three workers vomited blood; workers at Yongji Glass Factory worked 17 or 18 hours a day, and many workers became pale and thin from fatigue, and the capitalist did not provide treatment when they fell ill; Yishun Furnace started work before dawn and stopped work after dark for three or four consecutive months, seriously damaging the health of workers.

    Some capitalists violate the Trade Union Law, prevent workers from joining trade unions, and verbally abuse and beat trade union cadres. For example, Tianxiangyi's manager forced worker Liu Jialin, who had joined the trade union, to his death; the manager of Chengshun Furnace illegally dismissed workers who had joined the trade union; some capitalists even proposed "no joining the trade union" as a condition for hiring workers.

    Some capitalists arbitrarily dismiss workers without reporting to the trade union or obtaining approval from the Labor Bureau. The capitalist of Yongji Glass Factory illegally dismissed seven female workers, all of whom were Communist Youth League members and trade union members, under the pretext that "it's not convenient when it's hot." Some capitalists recruit more temporary workers to facilitate dismissal. Others use the means of falsely reporting closure or changing the company name to achieve the purpose of "legal" dismissal.

    Some capitalists, in the name of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea" and "Increasing Production and Making Donations," intensify the exploitation of workers. For example, the workers of Dongya Rubber Factory decided to donate one day's work each month, donating all the proceeds to airplanes and artillery, but the capitalist only donated the actual wages of the workers, seizing the more than 3 million yuan of profit created by the workers for himself. This despicable act of embezzling donations is not an isolated phenomenon.

    What's more, some capitalists adopt feudal rule methods to oppress workers, violate human rights, and abuse and beat apprentices. For example, at Yongji Glass Factory, all eleven apprentices had almost all been beaten, one of them as many as twelve times. This barbaric capitalist even created many ways to beat workers, calling hitting the worker's head "cracking walnuts"; pulling hair "plucking feathers"; pulling ears "pulling chicken testicles"; pulling ears and digging the ear canal with fingers "tiger picking teeth"; hitting the tip of the nose "probing the nose"; chopping the wrist with the hand "chopping mice"; kicking the root of the thigh "beating cripples," etc.

    The illegal behavior of capitalists is not only reflected in labor-capital relations but also in failing to obey the state's economic leadership. Some capitalists have serious illegal behaviors such as tax evasion, bribery of bad cadres, theft of state materials, raising prices, and disrupting finance.

    It is very inappropriate for such serious problems to occur in a new democratic country led by the working class. On the one hand, this is an exposure of the bourgeoisie's profit-only, opportunistic, and self-serving class nature under the current circumstances (private capitalist economy in Andong City has undergone some development); on the other hand, there have long been more serious problems in the leadership of the workers' movement in private enterprises in Andong City. The leadership has not fully mobilized and led the worker masses to conduct vigorous struggles against the illegal behavior of capitalists. At the same time, some cadres in government departments have also made serious mistakes in implementing labor protection and industrial and commercial management policies.

    As such, it not only fuels the illegal behavior of some capitalists but also causes the disintegration of the working class ranks and ideological confusion among some workers.

    Some workers have low class consciousness. Some are deceived by capitalists and become "shareholders," thus blurring their class consciousness; a few workers have an unclear understanding of the essence of the bourgeoisie, and are temporarily blinded by the petty favors of capitalists, so they adopt a bystander's passive attitude towards the illegal behavior of some capitalists.

    Although some workers are very angry about the illegal behavior of capitalists, they do not know how to use organizational power to carry out reasonable and legal political struggles because they have not received enough education, and they are accustomed to using simple economic struggle methods.

    There are also a few workers who have been temporarily tricked by the capitalists' divisive tactics, showing insufficient unity.

    As mentioned above, the main problem of the workers' movement in private enterprises in Andong City is currently the problem of right-leaning. This right-leaning deviation is by no means accidental and has ideological roots. At present, deeply digging into the roots of right-leaning thought has special and important significance for correcting the workers' movement in private enterprises in Andong City, for truly implementing the policy of "both labor and capital benefit, develop production," and for strengthening the strength of Resisting America, Aiding Korea.

    (II) Criticism of Several Erroneous Thoughts

    Regarding the issues of "the People's Government represents the interests of the four major classes" and "the Labor Bureau should stand on both labor and capital sides, holding both hands"

    "The People's Government represents the interests of the four major classes, and the Labor Bureau should stand on both labor and capital sides, holding both hands to be fair and reasonable." Some comrades raise these questions in order to explain the nature of the people's democratic government and the position of the personnel of the people's democratic government.

    The so-called "four major classes" in "the People's Democratic Government represents the interests of the four major classes" refers to the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. This formulation cannot explain the nature of the new democratic regime. It is already inappropriate to put the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie on an equal footing; it is even more inappropriate to call them the "four major classes." This is a distortion of the nature of the people's democratic regime. What is the nature of the people's democratic regime? Chairman Mao told us in his article On the People's Democratic Dictatorship: "The basis of the people's democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and mainly the alliance of workers and peasants, because these two classes account for 80 to 90 percent of the Chinese population." He also pointed out: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class is the most far-sighted, selfless, and has the most thorough revolution." "With the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." What kind of class is the national bourgeoisie? Chairman Mao said: "The national bourgeoisie cannot serve as the leader of the revolution, nor should they occupy a major position in the state power. The reason the national bourgeoisie cannot serve the leader of the revolution and should not occupy a major position in the state power is that their social and economic position stipulates their weakness. They lack foresight, lack sufficient courage, and many are afraid of the masses." Therefore, the nature of the people's democratic regime: "It is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party), based on the worker-peasant alliance." The Common Program also clearly stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a new democratic, that is, a people's democratic country, implementing the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all democratic classes and the people of all nationalities in the country."

    The problem is very clear. This so-called "four major classes" view is wrong and is a very cleverly concealed bourgeois view. Because it denies the leadership of the working class; it conceals the important significance of the theory that the people's democratic dictatorship is based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance; it lightly covers up the weaknesses and fear of the masses of the national bourgeoisie due to their social and economic position.

    What is the problem with the view that "the Labor Bureau should stand on both labor and capital sides, holding both hands"? What these comrades mean is that the Labor Bureau should stand on the position of both labor and capital, neither biased towards the labor side nor the capital side, but "fairly and justly" "holding both hands," which is called "fair and reasonable." The bourgeois position reflected in this erroneous view is exposed from the following erroneous view. Some people say: "The Federation of Industry and Commerce represents the interests of the bourgeoisie, but it has no power (referring to the role of the regime), so the Labor Bureau should speak for the capitalists." The workers raised a solemn criticism: "The Labor Bureau is two-faced." A responsible comrade of the Labor Bureau said: "There would be a problem if the Labor Bureau was not two-faced!" In essence, this "two-faced" is truly a problem. The workers said: "You are the capitalists' correspondents." This criticism has a certain basis.

    Then what position should the cadres of government departments stand on? Communist Party members should stand on the firm and unwavering position of the Communist Party, the position of the Party's policies, and the position of the consistent interests of the working class, both present and long-term. All non-Party cadres should clearly stand on the position of the people' democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the worker-peasant alliance. It is wrong to deviate from this position.

    Regarding the Question of "Relying on Whom"

    Judging from the current problems existing in the workers' movement in private enterprises in Andong City, the question of who to rely on in the city to implement the Party's various policies has not been completely resolved here. Some cadres of the Labor Bureau rarely or never meet directly with workers when issuing government orders. They do not first let the worker masses grasp the spirit of the policies and laws in order to give play to the leading role of the working class and implement the policies and laws among all the masses, but as usual, they convene capitalists by industry to hold meetings, only explaining policies to the capitalists and relying on the capitalists to ensure the implementation of government orders. The reason is: "The work of the workers is done by the trade union, and the Labor Bureau can do more work for the capitalists." However, the comrades of the trade union have not actively mobilized the workers to supervise the capitalists and ensure the implementation of government orders. In this way, some capitalists who do not understand the big picture have an opportunity to take advantage of. They can arbitrarily distort the spirit of policies and laws, damage the interests of the working class, and violate government laws in order to achieve the purpose of stealing state property and seizing illegal profits.

    The evil consequences caused by this erroneous thinking have not aroused enough vigilance among some of our comrades. Some people still think: "There is nothing wrong with doing more work for the capitalists, it depends on how it is done." In fact, it is wrong to rely on capitalists to implement government orders instead of relying on the working class. This is precisely handing over the leadership to the capitalists. We are not saying that capitalists should not be educated. Chairman Mao said in his article On the People's Democratic Dictatorship: "At the present stage, we can carry out many appropriate educational works for many people among them." There is a principled distinction between carrying out appropriate education work for capitalists and relying on capitalists to implement government orders, which cannot be confused. We must and should rely on the working class to implement government orders; only by mobilizing the worker masses can government orders be truly implemented among the masses.

    The reason for this error is mainly that some cadres lack a correct understanding of the essence of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao pointed out so clearly in his 1926 article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society": "That wavering middle class, its right wing may be our enemy, its left wing may be our friend - but we must always be wary of them and not let them disrupt our ranks." Because "this class represents the capitalist relations of production in China. They have a contradictory attitude towards the Chinese revolution: when they feel pain from foreign capital strikes and warlord oppression, they need revolution and support the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord revolutionary movement; but when the revolution has the brave participation of the domestic proletariat and the active assistance of the international proletariat, and they feel threatened by the development of their class to achieve the status of the big bourgeoisie, they doubt the revolution."

    Chairman Mao's brilliant analysis of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is not only a theoretical guide for formulating policies towards the bourgeoisie at that time but also a very profound portrayal of the essence of the national bourgeoisie; it is not only applicable at that time but also completely applicable now. Isn't the class nature exposed by some capitalists in Andong City today exactly the same as Chairman Mao's analysis more than twenty-six years ago? Although the political and economic situation in China today has undergone fundamental changes compared to the political and economic situation in China at that time, the essence of the national bourgeoisie has not changed.

    It is precisely because some of our comrades lack a comprehensive understanding of the essence of the national bourgeoisie that they have adopted a policy of appeasement or even protection towards the serious illegal behavior of capitalists and the serious behavior of damaging the interests of the working class, overemphasizing the role of persuasion and education, believing that simple persuasion and education can make those capitalists who do not understand the big picture turn from evil to good, and fantasizing about using simple persuasion and education to correct the reactionary thoughts and behaviors of some capitalists. The handling of labor-capital dispute cases in Andong City in the past year can fully illustrate this problem. From January to September 1951, the 104 labor-capital dispute cases mediated by the Labor Bureau were all cases of capitalists violating government laws and harming the interests of the working class. Many of these cases have gone beyond the scope of mediation and should be dealt with according to law, and the worker masses should be actively mobilized to carry out legal struggles. Because we have not given the illegal capitalists the legal sanctions they deserve, especially because we have not fully mobilized the worker masses to carry out vigorous legal struggles, some capitalists have become bolder in violating government laws and damaging the interests of the working class; the number of labor-capital dispute cases has gradually increased. What a profound lesson this should be for us!

    Regarding the Question of "Worker Backwardness"

    "Workers are too backward, not as enlightened as capitalists," "Workers are selfish," "Worker economism is very serious," "Workers are passive and lazy." Some comrades have these erroneous views because they do not understand the essence of the working class. Chairman Mao taught us in his article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society": "Although the industrial proletariat is small in number, it is the representative of China's new productive forces and the most progressive class in modern China, and it has become the leading force in the revolutionary movement." The workers of private enterprises in Andong City are a part of the Chinese working class and possess the same noble qualities. They have overcome and are overcoming various difficulties in production, bravely and resolutely completing and exceeding production tasks, and shouldering the huge responsibility in the country's construction work. They have played the role that the leading class should play in various works of Resisting America, Aiding Korea. With the continuous improvement of class consciousness, they will give play to greater enthusiasm and make greater contributions to the country and the people.

    Some comrades have put forward the following phenomena as "proof" of "worker backwardness": Is it not a manifestation of backwardness that some workers are bought off and roped in by capitalists? Is it not a manifestation of backwardness that some workers dare not rise up to fight against the behavior of capitalists that seriously damages the interests of the working class? Is it not a manifestation of backwardness that some workers do not actively participate in cultural learning and political learning? Is it not a manifestation of economism that some workers simply demand wage increases? Are there not some phenomena of disunity among some workers, is this not a manifestation of guildism? We must admit that there are some backward phenomena in our working class ranks. However, these backward phenomena are not a manifestation of the essence of the working class, but the result of long-term exploitation and oppression and the result of the long-term influence of bourgeois ideology. It is extremely wrong for some comrades to consider some backward phenomena of the working class as the essence of the working class without analysis. Affirming that these backward phenomena will inevitably be gradually overcome with the continuous improvement of the working class's consciousness. It is very wrong to stand outside the working class ranks and irresponsibly simply complain, or follow behind the bourgeoisie and make irresponsible remarks.

    It should be known that the spontaneous movement of workers will not produce socialist and communist ideas. As pointed out in Chapter Two of the Brief History of the CPSU (B.): "The socialist ideological system does not arise from the spontaneous movement, but from science." If the Party neglects the education of the working class, neglects the role of improving the class consciousness of the worker masses, it weakens the Party's leadership over the workers' movement; if the Party does not conduct socialist and communist ideological education for the working class, it will strengthen the influence of the bourgeois ideological system on the workers. As Lenin said: "The question can only be like this: is it the bourgeois ideological system or the socialist ideological system? There is no middle way here... Therefore, any contempt for and any abandonment of the socialist ideological system is to strengthen the bourgeois ideological system." The existence of some backward phenomena in the current private enterprise worker ranks precisely shows that we have not fulfilled the responsibilities we should bear for the working class and have not fulfilled the responsibilities of organizing and educating them. It is precisely because of this that when we see some backward phenomena in the working class ranks, we should not adopt an attitude of ridicule and contempt, but should reflect on ourselves.

    We should bravely examine ourselves. In the past, we basically let the workers' movement in private enterprises go its own way. The crux of the problem lies here. Our basic lesson is: we must strengthen the Party's leadership over the workers' movement in private enterprises, resolutely rely on the working class to implement the Party's various policies, and strengthen the education of the working class to improve the consciousness of the working class and improve the leading role of the working class in the people's democratic regime. Because only the working class armed with revolutionary theory is the most reliable class.

    Regarding the Question of Struggle and Unity

    The behavior of some capitalists who do not understand the big picture and violate government laws and damage the interests of the working class has aroused the indignation of all workers. Under the direct leadership of the Party and the trade union, the workers of private enterprises have begun to take action to fight against illegal capitalists. This struggle is completely necessary.

    Some people doubt whether doing so will affect our unity with the capitalists. We say: No. Because this necessary struggle is not for anything else, but precisely to implement the basic policy of "both labor and capital benefit, develop production." The key to labor-capital unity lies in the benefit of both labor and capital, and the premise of the benefit of both labor and capital is the leadership of the working class. Our unity with capitalists is a unity with a clear stance. We must firmly stand on the position of the working class. Our unity with capitalists is not a unity that cancels out struggle. Only by mobilizing the broad masses of workers to carry out necessary struggles and implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production can we achieve true unity. It is hypocritical unity to talk about unity with capitalists by leaving the ranks of the working class. One of our basic lessons in the past lies here. For example, the manager of Zhonghechi dismissed workers without authorization, citing the shortcomings of the trade union grassroots cadres, without consulting with the trade union or obtaining approval from the Labor Bureau. We should adopt a serious struggle method to protect the legitimate interests of workers against this behavior that openly violates the Trade Union Law. This is the correct attitude. However, the responsible cadres of our private enterprise trade unions and the Labor Bureau, fearing that it would affect the unity with the capitalists, actually accepted the capitalists' unreasonable demands (workers wrote letters of repentance to the capitalists), and then the capitalists reluctantly allowed the resumption of work. After such treatment, the managers of other bathhouses also used the same excuse to dismiss workers unreasonably. What kind of "unity" is this? Things like this have happened more than once.

    The problem is very clear. This suspicion that it will affect unity with capitalists is unfounded.

    纠正安东市私营企业工人运动中的右倾思想
    中国共产党安东市委员会书记  张烈
    （一）目前安东市私营企业劳资关系上有严重的问题
    安东市私营企业的劳资关系，目前存在着相当严重的问题。其原因，一方面是资产阶级严重地破坏政府法令，向工人进攻；一方面是工人运动的领导表现无力，没有充分发动和领导工人群众进行坚决的斗争，结果造成部分工人思想混乱、组织涣散的情况。
    有些资本家趁职工生活困难、急求复工的机会，藉口营业情况不好，拒绝共产党员、青年团员、工会干部以及积极分子复工。为达到这个目的，资本家曾采取许多卑鄙的手段：有的收买少数落后工人来拒绝工会干部复工；有的专找党员、团员、工会干部的小缺点，作为拒绝复工的藉口；对那些急待复工的党员、团员及工会积极分子，先施以威胁手段，然后才允许复工。
    有些资本家则以插股分红的办法，麻痹工人的阶级意识，限制工人的政治活动，以逃避政府法令的约束。有的资本家骗工人入股后，向工人说：“咱们不是劳资关系。大家开工厂，我当职员。我们为了多分钱，今后不能公休，不能给加班加点费，不能改善生活。”当工会干部去组织工人参加工会时，他说：“我们都是东家。”劳动局命令他执行公休假日的制度时，他又说：“大家不愿意公休。”
    有的为了追逐超额利润，不顾工人身体健康，过分延长工作时间，加班加点；不改善安全卫生设备；重机器不重人，造成了严重的伤亡事故，造成过劳致死、积劳成病的严重现象。如：泰丰造纸厂以蒸骨锅代替蒸料锅，结果蒸锅爆破，烫死工人两名；协茂造纸厂某工人因过劳积病，休息期间，资方停发工资，这个工友带病上班，因而过劳致死；天祥益药房经理逼死工人刘家林；和昌造纸厂，不改善安全卫生设备和劳动条件，有三名工友吐血；永记玻璃厂工人每天工作十七、八小时，很多工人累得面黄肌瘦，累病了资本家不给医治；义顺炉曾连续三、四个月天不亮就开工，天黑才停工，严重损害工人身体健康。
    有的资本家违反工会法，阻止工人参加工会，并谩骂和殴打工会干部。如天祥益经理逼死参加了工会的工人刘家林；成顺炉经理非法解雇参加工会的工人；有的资本家竟提出“不准参加工会”为招收工人的条件。
    有的资本家不报告工会和不经劳动局批准，任意解雇工人。永记玻璃厂资本家以“天热不方便”为名，非法解雇七名女工，这些工人都是青年团员和工会会员；有的资本家为了便于解雇，多招收临时工；也有的用伪报歇业、更换字号的手段，达到“合法”解雇的目的。
    有些资本家借“抗美援朝”“增产捐献”的美名，加重对工人的剥削。如东亚橡胶厂的工人决定每月献工一天，将全部所得捐献飞机大炮，而资本家只把工人的实际工资拿出捐献，把工人创造的三百多万元的利润，攫为己有。这种可卑的贪污捐献款的行为，并非个别现象。
    更有些资本家采取封建统治的办法，压迫工人，侵犯人权，虐待和打骂徒工。如永记玻璃厂，共有十一个徒工，几乎全部被打过，其中一个徒工竟被打十二次。这个野蛮的资本家竟创造了许多打工人的花样，打工人的脑袋称为“砸核桃”；扯头发称为“拔毛”；扯耳朵叫“扯鸡巴蛋”；扯耳朵再用手指头挖耳根叫“老虎剔牙”；打鼻子尖叫“探鼻子”；用手砍胳膊腕叫“砍耗子”；踢大腿根叫“打瘸子”等。
    资本家的违法行为不仅表现在劳资关系上，也表现在不服从国家经济的领导上。有些资本家有偷漏国税、收买坏干部、盗取国家物资、高抬物价、扰乱金融等严重的违法行为。
    在以工人阶级为领导的新民主主义国家里，竟发生如此严重的问题，是非常不应该的。这一方面是资产阶级的唯利是图、投机取巧、损人利己的阶级本质在目前情况（安东市私人资本主义经济有了某些发展）下的暴露；另一方面则是安东市私营企业工人运动的领导上长期存在着较严重的问题。领导方面没有充分发动与领导工人群众，向资本家违法行为进行有力的斗争。同时，政府部门的某些干部在执行劳动保护和工商管理政策上，也犯了严重的错误。
    如此，不仅助长了某些资本家的违法行为，也造成工人阶级队伍的涣散，和部分工人思想上的混乱。
    部分工人的阶级觉悟不高，有的被资本家欺骗，成为“股东”，因而更模糊了自己的阶级意识；有少数工人对资产阶级的本质认识不清，再加上一时被资本家的小恩小惠所蒙蔽，因而对某些资本家的不法行为，抱着旁观的消极态度。
    有一部分工人，对资本家的违法行为，虽然非常气忿，但是由于平时受教育不够，不会运用组织力量进行合理合法的政治斗争，而习惯于进行单纯经济斗争的方法。
    也还有少数工人一时中了资本家的挑拨离间之计，表现了不够团结的现象。
    如上所述，安东市私营企业工人运动目前主要的问题是右倾的问题。这种右的偏向绝非偶然，是有思想根源的。在目前深挖一挖右倾思想的根子，对端正安东市私营企业工人运动，对真正地贯彻“劳资两利，发展生产”的政策，对增强抗美援朝的力量，有特殊重要的意义。
    （二）对几种错误思想的批判
    关于“人民政府是代表四大阶级利益”和“劳动局应站在劳资双方，一手托两家”的问题
    “人民政府代表四大阶级的利益，劳动局应站在劳资双方，一手托两家，才算公平合理”。有些同志这样提出问题的目的，是想说明人民民主政府的性质，以及人民民主政府工作人员的立场。
    所谓“人民民主政府是代表四大阶级的利益”的“四大阶级”，是指的工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。这样的提法不能够说明新民主主义政权的性质。把工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级平列起来，已经不妥；再名之曰“四大阶级”则更为不当。这是对人民民主政权性质的曲解。人民民主政权的性质是什么呢？毛主席在论人民民主专政一文中告诉我们说：“人民民主专政的基础是工人阶级、农民阶级和城市小资产阶级的联盟，而主要是工人和农民的联盟，因为这两个阶级占了中国人口的百分之八十到九十”。又指出：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见、大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”“有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”民族资产阶级是怎样一个阶级呢？毛主席说：“民族资产阶级不能充当革命的领导者，也不应当在国家政权中占主要的地位。民族资产阶级之所以不能充当革命的领导者和所以不应当在国家政权中占主要地位，是因为民族资产阶级的社会经济地位规定了他们的软弱性，他们缺乏远见，缺乏足够的勇气，并且有不少人害怕民众。”因之，人民民主政权的性质：“就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。”共同纲领中也明确地规定着：“中华人民共和国为新民主主义即人民民主主义的国家，实行工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政。”
    问题很清楚了，这种所谓“四大阶级”的观点是错误的，是隐蔽得很巧妙的资产阶级的观点。因为它否认了工人阶级的领导权；它隐蔽了人民民主专政是以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的这个理论的重要意义；它把民族资产阶级由于社会经济地位规定了的软弱性及害怕民众的特点轻轻地掩盖过去。
    “劳动局应站在劳资双方，一手托两家”的观点，又是一个什么问题呢？这些同志的意思是说：劳动局应该站在劳资双方的立场上，既不偏劳方，也不偏资方，而是“公公正正”地“一手托两家”，这才叫做“公平合理”。这种错误观点所反映出的资产阶级的立场，又从下面的错误观点暴露出来。有人讲：“工商业联合会是代表资产阶级的利益，但它没有权力（指政权的作用），所以，劳动局应该代表资本家说话。”工人们提出了严正的批评说：“劳动局是两面光。”劳动局的一位负责同志说：“劳动局如果不两面光才有问题呢！”实质上，这个“两面光”才真正地有问题。工人们说：“你们是资本家的通讯员。”这个批评是有一定的根据的。
    那么政府部门的干部应该站在什么立场呢？共产党员应该站在坚定不移的共产党的立场，党的政策的立场，工人阶级目前利益和长远利益一致的立场。一切非党干部应该明确地站在以工人阶级（经过共产党）为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的立场上，离开了这个立场就是错误。
    关于“依靠谁”的问题
    从目前安东市私营企业工人运动中所存在的问题来看，在城市中依靠什么人贯彻党的各种政策的问题，在我们这里仍未完全解决。劳动局的某些干部在下达政令时，很少甚至没有直接和工人见面。他们不是首先让工人群众掌握政策法令的精神，以便发挥工人阶级的领导作用，把政策法令贯彻到全体群众中去，而是照例地按行业召集资本家开会，只是向资本家交代政策，依靠资本家保证政令的执行。理由是：“工人工作由工会去做，劳动局可多做些资本家的工作。”而工会工作同志也没积极发动工人监督资本家，保证政令的贯彻执行。这样，某些不明大义的资本家就有了可乘之机。他们可以任意曲解政策法令的精神，损害工人阶级的利益，破坏政府法令，以达到盗窃国家资财、攫取非法利润的目的。
    这种错误思想所造成的恶果，还没有引起我们某些同志足够的警惕。有人还认为：“多做些资本家的工作没有错误，只看怎样做法。”实际上，不依靠工人阶级贯彻政令，而依靠资本家贯彻政令的“做法”就是错误的。这正是把领导权交给了资本家。我们并不是说不应该对资本家进行教育。毛主席在论人民民主专政一文中说：“在现阶段就可以向他们中间的许多人们进行许多适当的教育工作。”对资本家进行适当的教育工作和依靠资本家去贯彻政令，有原则的区别，不能混为一谈。我们必须而且应该依靠工人阶级去贯彻政令；也只有把工人群众发动起来，政令才能真正地贯彻到群众中去。
    这个错误产生的原因，主要是某些干部对资产阶级的本质缺乏正确的认识。毛主席一九二六年在
    “中国社会各阶级的分析”一文中就曾如此明确地指出：“那动摇不定的中产阶级，其右翼可能是我们的敌人，其左翼可能是我们的朋友——但我们要时常提防他们，不要让他们扰乱了我们的阵线。”因为“这个阶级代表中国资本主义的生产关系。他们对于中国革命具有矛盾的态度：他们在受外资打击、军阀压迫感觉痛苦时，需要革命，赞成反帝国主义反军阀的革命运动；但是当着革命在国内有本国无产阶级的勇猛参加，在国外有国际无产阶级的积极援助，对其欲达到大资产阶级地位的阶级的发展感觉到威胁时，他们又怀疑革命”。
    毛主席对中国民族资产阶级这个卓越的分析，不仅是当时制定对资产阶级政策的理论指南，而且是对于民族资产阶级的本质的很深刻的刻画；不仅当时适用，现在也完全适用。目前安东市某些资本家所暴露出的阶级本质，不正和毛主席远在二十六年以前的分析一模一样吗？虽然今天中国的政治经济情况和当时中国的政治经济情况有了根本的变化，但民族资产阶级的本质并无变化。
    正因为我们某些同志对民族资产阶级的本质缺乏全面的认识，所以对资本家的严重的违法行为和严重的损害工人阶级利益的行为，采取了姑息甚至包庇的态度，过分强调说服教育的作用，认为单纯的说服教育就可以使那些不明大义的资本家去恶向善，幻想用单纯说服教育的办法来纠正某些资本家的反动思想行为。一年来安东市有关方面对所发生的劳资纠纷案件的处理情况，可以充分说明这个问题。从一九五一年一月到九月份劳动局所调解的一百零四件劳资纠纷的案件，都是资本家破坏政府法令、危害工人阶级利益的案件。其中有许多案件已超出了调解的范围，应该依法处理，更应该积极地发动工人群众进行合法的斗争。由于我们没有给违法的资本家以应得的法律制裁，特别是由于我们没有充分发动工人群众进行有力的合法斗争，某些资本家就更大胆地破坏政府法令，损害工人阶级利益；劳资纠纷案件反而逐渐增加。这对我们该是何等深刻的教训！
    关于“工人落后”的问题
    “工人太落后啦，不如资本家开明”，“工人自私自利”，“工人经济主义很严重”，“工人消极怠工”。某些同志有这些错误观点，是由于不了解工人阶级的本质。毛主席在“中国社会各阶级的分析”一文中教导我们说：“工业无产阶级人数虽不多，却是中国新的生产力的代表者，是近代中国最进步的阶级，做了革命运动的领导力量。”安东市私营企业的工人，是中国工人阶级的一部分，具备着同样高贵的品质。他们已经克服了和正在克服着生产中的各种困难，勇敢而坚决地完成并超过了生产任务，肩负了国家建设工作中的巨大责任。他们在抗美援朝的各项工作中，起了领导阶级应起的作用。随着阶级觉悟的不断提高，他们将发挥更大的积极性，对国家对人民将有更大的贡献。
    有的同志曾提出下列的现象来做为“工人落后”的“论证”：部分工人被资本家收买、拉拢，不是落后的表现吗？部分工人对资本家严重损害工人阶级利益的行为，不敢起来斗争，不是落后的表现吗？部分工人不积极地参加文化学习和政治学习，不是落后的表现吗？部分工人单纯要求增加工资，不是经济主义的表现吗？部分工人之间还有些不团结的现象，这不是行会主义思想的表现吗？我们必须承认：我们工人阶级队伍里是存在着某些落后现象的。但这些落后现象并不是工人阶级本质的表现，而是长期受剥削受压迫的结果，是长期受资产阶级思想影响的结果。某些同志把工人阶级的某些落后现象，不加分析地就认为是工人阶级的本质，这是极端错误的。肯定地说，这些落后现象随着工人阶级觉悟的不断提高，必然会逐渐地克服。站在工人阶级队伍之外，不负责任地单纯埋怨，或跟在资产阶级屁股后面，信口雌黄，都是非常错误的。
    应该知道，工人自发的运动，不会产生社会主义和共产主义思想。正如联共党史简要读本第二章所指出的：“社会主义思想体系不是从自发运动中，而是从科学中产生出来的。”党如果忽视了对工人阶级的教育，忽视了提高工人群众的阶级觉悟的作用，就是削弱了党对工人运动的领导；如果党不对工人阶级进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，就会加强资产阶级思想体系对工人的影响。正如列宁所说：“问题就只能是这样：是资产阶级的思想体系呢，还是社会主义的思想体系呢。这里没有什么中间的道路……因此，对于社会主义思想体系的任何轻视与任何离弃，都是加强资产阶级思想体系的。”目前私营企业工人队伍中的某些落后现象的存在，正是说明我们没有尽到对工人阶级应负的责任，没有尽到组织他们教育他们的责任。也正因为如此，当我们看到工人阶级队伍里某些落后现象的时候，不应该采取讥讽与轻侮的态度，而应该反躬自问。
    我们应该勇敢地检讨。过去，我们对私营企业工人运动，基本上是放任自流的。问题的症结就在这里。我们的基本教训是：必须加强党对私营企业工人运动的领导，坚决依靠工人阶级来贯彻党的各种政策，加强对工人阶级的教育，以提高工人阶级的觉悟，提高工人阶级在人民民主政权中的领导作用。因为，只有用革命理论武装起来的工人阶级，才是最可靠的阶级。
    关于斗争与团结的问题
    不明大义的部分资本家破坏政府法令，损害工人阶级利益的行为，已引起全体工人们的激愤。私营企业的工人们，在党和工会的直接领导下已开始行动起来向不法的资本家进行斗争了，这个斗争是完全必要的。
    有人怀疑到这样做会不会影响我们和资本家的团结。我们说：不会的。因为这种必要的斗争，不是为了别的，而正是为了贯彻“劳资两利，发展生产”的基本方针。劳资团结的关键在于劳资两利，劳资两利的前提是工人阶级的领导。我们和资本家的团结是有立场的团结。我们必须站稳工人阶级的立场。我们和资本家之间的团结，不是取消了斗争的团结。只有把广大工人发动起来，进行必要的斗争，贯彻劳资两利、发展生产的政策，才能达到真正的团结。离开了工人阶级的队伍去和资本家讲团结，是虚伪的团结。过去我们的基本教训之一，就在这里。例如：中和池的经理，藉口工会基层干部有缺点，不和工会协商，也不经劳动局批准，擅自解雇工人。对这种公然破坏工会法的行为，我们应该采取严肃斗争的方法，保护工人的合法利益。这才是正确的态度。但是，我们私营企业工会和劳动局的负责干部，怕影响了和资本家的团结，竟接受了资本家的无理要求（工人向资本家写悔过书），然后，资本家才勉强地允许复工。这样处理之后，其他浴池的经理，也就以同样的藉口，把工人无理解雇。这是什么“团结”呢？像这样的事情，不止一次地发生过。
    问题很清楚了，这种怕影响了与资本家团结的怀疑是没有根据的。
