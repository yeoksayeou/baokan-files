The movement to encircle and suppress corrupt elements in Beijing's literary and art organizations has been launched fiercely. Facts already revealed prove that some cadres in literary and art circles have been severely eroded by bourgeois ideology, not only manifested in erroneous literary and artistic thinking and serious extravagance and waste, but also in base and shameless acts of corruption.

Yang Pei, associate of the orchestra of the Opera and Dance Drama Theater affiliated with the Central Academy of Drama, and Liu Xian, director of the People's Art Factory affiliated with the Beijing People's Art Theater, are prominent examples. Yang Pei, from a landlord family, infiltrated the Party in 1937 (now expelled from the Party). He had been disciplined by the Party for corruption in the past, but he did not repent. After entering the city, under the erosion of bourgeois ideology, he intensified his corrupt acts. He used the opportunity of purchasing musical instruments to commit corruption by fabricating false receipts and embezzling goods, with some instruments being reimbursed multiple times. When local cultural troupes asked him to purchase instruments on their behalf, he invariably embezzled from the transactions. Many public instruments were embezzled and sold by him. During the anti-corruption movement, Yang Pei not only refused to confess, but also abused his power, suppressed democracy, sabotaged the movement, and formed a "defense alliance" with merchants. Even after mass exposure and accusations, he only admitted to a portion of the corrupt facts, adopting an extremely cunning attitude and refusing to make a thorough confession. On January 24, at an anti-corruption struggle meeting of more than 2,000 people convened by the Ministry of Culture, the masses unanimously demanded that Yang Pei be sent to the court for punishment. Representatives of the Beijing People's Court accepted the demands of the masses and arrested him to be dealt with according to the law.

Liu Xian, a woodcut artist who had been an art teacher at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Yan'an, has degenerated into an illegal capitalist since becoming the director of the People's Art Factory affiliated with the Beijing People's Art Theater in March 1950. He suppressed democracy and verbally abused workers; he arbitrarily reduced the 56-day maternity leave stipulated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for female workers to 40 days; and he did everything possible to obstruct the establishment of trade unions and the Communist Youth League in the factory. Like an illegal capitalist, he colluded with Wang Zhuojun (Liu's wife), the head of the factory's administrative section, to evade taxes, deceive customers, seek exorbitant profits, and engage in corruption. They adopted methods such as not entering items into the books to evade a large amount of income tax and business tax; they falsely engraved the seal of the "Zhangji Repair Shop" and falsely printed the shop's receipts to pay less in handling fees. In one year and three months, the factory evaded taxes of more than 89 million yuan. They sold low-quality goods at high prices to deceive customers and fabricated repair invoices to deceive consigners. At the request of all employees of the factory, Liu Xian and Wang Zhuojun have been suspended from their duties.

The Fine Arts Supply Cooperative of the Central Academy of Fine Arts undertook the task of making commemorative medals for the liberation of Northwest and North China in 1950. It was agreed with the relevant authorities that each tael of gold could plate approximately 4,000 commemorative medals, but in reality, each tael could plate about 6,000 medals. The person in charge of the cooperative instructed several people to steal more than 20 taels of gold. It is intolerable that the cooperative adopted base and illegal means to seek exorbitant profits from such historically significant commemorative items. In 1951, when celebrating National Day, the cooperative participated in the work of decorating Tiananmen Square, and also falsely reported labor and materials to seek exorbitant profits amounting to more than 30 million yuan. In 1950, they undertook the production and decoration of exhibits for China's participation in international exhibitions in Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Due to the short timeframe and urgent tasks, they pre-paid 400 million yuan from the exhibition preparation committee, stipulating that actual expenses would be reported and settled after the work was completed. As a result, the actual cost of the work was 173.5 million yuan, but they falsely reported expenses by more than 150 million yuan, attempting to have all 400 million yuan reimbursed. When the Ministry of Trade refused to approve it, the Fine Arts Supply Cooperative sent cadres to quibble in every possible way, and only returned 43 million yuan. In 1950, the cooperative bought a batch of copper and evaded taxes amounting to 60 million yuan by altering receipts and fabricating false accounts. Most of these illegal acts of corruption should be the responsibility of Wu Lao, the director of the Fine Arts Supply Cooperative.

The phenomena of corruption and waste in the Beijing Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau are also very serious. Wang Quanguo, a clerk in the general affairs section of the administrative office, embezzled a total of more than 180 million yuan in construction projects and has been arrested and dealt with according to the law. Lei Zhenbang, a composer in the music section, had a father who was a traitor. He concealed enemy and puppet property and stole state assets amounting to more than 100 million yuan. Jin Chi, a trainee photographer in the news photography team, was a Communist Party member who, while serving as the team leader in the Northwest photography team, stole and embezzled 5 million yuan of Party propaganda funds. In the production department, the phenomenon of stealing state film equipment, such as film stock, chemicals, and vacuum tubes, is also very serious. For example, Li Jinchen stole hundreds of pieces of large and small projection equipment and radio equipment, worth more than 96 million yuan.

In the news photography team of the studio, it was quite common to use public funds, take advantage of public resources, falsely report travel expenses, falsely report subsidies, and enjoy double supplies. In the past, it was considered a "legitimate" behavior for photographers to use public film for private use or to give it away as favors.

The studio's documentary filming resulted in rework and waste due to a lack of planning in advance, or insufficient planning, or a lack of seriousness on the part of the staff. According to preliminary estimates, the loss of film stock is worth nearly 300 million yuan. Last July, when filming the documentary "Rich Salt Production" in the Changlu Salt District, it was during the salt farm's rest period. However, in order to shoot a large scene of a bumper harvest, more than 200 workers and a cultural troupe were mobilized to set up a large scene. In order to film the shot of the salt, 100 tons of finished salt were poured back into the salt ponds. The workers advocated pouring less, but the filming staff insisted on pouring it all. After all 100 tons of salt were poured into the water, the workers rescued half of it. Not only was more than 50 tons of salt lost, but also more than 600 man-days were wasted. If the water in the salt ponds was used to make salt again, the taste would be bitter and the color would turn black, making it inedible. Therefore, the original water in the salt ponds needed to be returned to the sea, and new seawater had to be introduced, which would waste another 600 man-days, making the number of losses difficult to estimate. In the same film, in order to shoot a scene of a cultural troupe performing to celebrate the bumper harvest of salt, the stage was re-arranged, using seven bolts of cloth, not counting labor costs. Four shots were taken, but they were all ruined. In order to film a scene of presenting flowers, a bouquet of flowers was specially purchased by train from Lutai to Tianjin.

Among film directors, there is a widespread lack of awareness of cherishing state assets, and they completely separate artistic work from economic work. Some directors even believe that doing artistic work is noble, and it is best to manage less money or not manage money at all. They do not review or check the actual budget, expenditure, and final accounts of a film, completely pushing all economic responsibilities to the production manager or assistant director, and even handing over their stamps to the production manager or accountant, considering it too much trouble to even stamp invoices. Some directors like to use large sets, large scenes, and pursue luxurious costumes and props; some, with personal goals, want to become famous in one fell swoop, and forcibly turn an educational short film or a story short film into a feature film; some produce crude and shoddy work, filming hastily; some plan poorly, resulting in rework and waste. According to the key inspection of the waste of "Towards New China" by the studio's director's office, cash alone accounted for more than one-third of the film's total expenditure, amounting to more than 90 million yuan, not including the waste of other equipment and materials.

The China Youth Art Theater has, for the past two years, incurred significant waste in scenery, costumes, and props due to a lack of thorough consideration in performances. Sometimes they dismantle well-made scenery and redo it; some costumes are made and found to be unsuitable, so they are remade, wasting more than 48 million yuan. Socializing, entertaining, and dining have become the norm. Even cadres of the theater going to the countryside to participate in land reform are treated with farewell banquets, and welcome banquets are held upon their return from work outside. In 1951 alone, more than 11 million yuan was wasted. Associated with this is the neglect of ideological leadership, especially the lack of the ideological leadership of the working class. The stillbirths of the plays "Heroic Mother" and "Sunday in the Sunshine" are obvious examples. When reviewing the script, the reviewers adopted a conciliatory and compromising attitude towards the petty-bourgeois ideology contained in the play "Heroic Mother," and passed it. In order to rehearse this play, the playwrights, directors, and actors went to factories in Shanghai and Tianjin to experience life for nearly two months. When the workers raised sharp principled criticisms of this play, which distorted the image of workers, they had no choice but to stop rehearsals, wasting more than 80 million yuan for this reason. According to preliminary statistics, more than 232 million yuan has been wasted in performances, entertaining, construction, and other aspects in the past two years.

The Youth Art Theater feasts extravagantly, enriches its own small collective, and accumulates a large amount of materials and equipment. The losses incurred in the accumulation of funds are impossible to calculate. In order to enrich its own small collective, they tried their best to get money from higher-level organs. When the theater was first established, it received funds for a total of 330 phantom personnel over the course of three months. Money that was not used in the budget was not turned over, but was used to purchase cloth and store it. There are currently 25,612 feet of accumulated printed cloth, white cloth, silk, etc., worth more than 126 million yuan. The accumulation of musical instruments is also appalling. In addition to each member of the orchestra being able to have three instruments, there are still 247 instruments left, worth more than 118 million yuan. There is also a large accumulation of light bulbs, lighting paper, etc. used in plays. The value of the existing items is more than 37 million yuan, which is estimated to be enough to use for three or four years even if there are performances every day. The most serious thing is that last year, an electrical switchboard was ordered from a private merchant, Pang Yinhuan. At that time, a cash deposit of 10 million yuan was paid, and it has not been delivered for nineteen months. However, in order to receive this funding from higher-level organs, the receipts submitted by the Youth Art Theater to higher levels contained forged receipts showing that the goods had been delivered. This is a fraudulent act, using state funds to provide working capital for the private merchant Pang Yinhuan. According to statistics, the total value of various materials accumulated by the theater in the past two years is more than 337 million yuan.

In addition to this, when the "Cultural Train" belonging to the theater returned to Beijing from the Northeast and the South, it privately transported more than 20,700 jin of rice, 264 bottles of wine, and 720 bottles of beer, violating railway regulations and evading transportation fees. Most of these wines were drunk during banquets. The rural service team belonging to the theater smuggled gasoline, a prohibited item, in violation of railway regulations when it screened movies in Yan'an.

The phenomena of theft and embezzlement in the theater's administrative office, business storage room, musical instruments, and lighting departments are also very serious.

In terms of construction projects, illegal private merchants colluded with Feng Shixiang, the deputy section chief of the general affairs section of the theater's administrative office, to use day laborers for skilled labor, cut corners, and use inferior materials. The houses leaked rain as soon as they were built, the floor slabs cracked, and the roof beams were bent. Rework and repairs were frequent. Feng Shixiang, Liu Junmin, and others engaged in corruption and bribery, causing huge losses to state assets.

Some ticket sellers and ticket takers at the Youth Palace belonging to the theater used various methods to embezzle ticket revenue, such as reselling returned tickets, embezzling proceeds from box office tickets, and selling duplicate tickets. There was also the practice of selling individual tickets, but putting them together and calling them group tickets, embezzling the discounted portion. This kind of ticket embezzlement was not an isolated phenomenon. Many cinemas and theaters, such as the Capital and Victory cinemas, have similar situations.

The above facts prove that the phenomena of corruption and waste in Beijing's literary and art organizations and their affiliated cultural enterprises are very serious. Some cadres have degenerated into indistinguishable from奸商who steal and deceive state assets. Beijing's literary and art organizations are launching a deeper and more vigorous struggle to encircle and attack corrupt elements and repel the frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie.

    北京文艺界展开对贪污浪费分子的斗争
    北京文艺机关团体中的围剿贪污分子的运动已猛烈展开。从已经揭露的事实证明：文艺界某些干部严重地受到了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，不仅表现在错误的文艺思想上，表现在严重的铺张浪费现象上，而且还表现在卑劣无耻的贪污行为上。
    中央戏剧学院所属歌舞剧院管弦乐团协理员杨培、北京人民艺术剧院所属人民艺术工厂厂长刘岘等是其中明显的例子。杨培出身于地主家庭，一九三七年混入党内（现已被开除党籍），过去曾因贪污受过党的处分，但他并不悔改。入城后，在资产阶级思想侵蚀下，他更变本加厉地继续他的贪污罪行。他利用经手购买乐器的机会，用造假单据、盗卖等种种办法进行贪污，有些乐器竟重复报账数次。各地文工团托他代买乐器，他没有一次不从中贪污。公家的许多乐器被他盗卖。在反贪污运动中，杨培不但拒不坦白，而且滥用职权，压制民主，破坏运动，并和商人订立“攻守同盟”。经群众揭发、检举，他也只是承认了一部分贪污事实，态度极其狡猾，拒绝彻底交代。一月二十四日，在中央文化部召开的两千多人的反贪污斗争大会上，群众一致要求将杨培送法院制裁，北京人民法院的代表接受了群众要求，已将他逮捕法办。
    曾任延安鲁迅艺术学院美术教员的木刻家刘岘自
    一九五○年三月担任北京人民艺术剧院所属人民艺术工厂厂长以来，已堕落成像一个不法的资本家。他压制民主，辱骂工人；将全国总工会规定的女工产假五十六天擅自缩减为四十天；并百般阻挠该厂工人建立工会和青年团。他更像不法资本家一样伙同该厂行政科长王卓君（刘的妻子）偷漏税款，欺骗顾客，牟取暴利，从中贪污。他们曾采取不入账的办法，偷漏了大批所得税和营业税；曾假刻“章记修理所”图章，假印该所单据，少缴了大批手续费。在一年零三个月中，该厂漏税就在八千九百万元以上。他们曾将低货高价出售，欺骗顾客；曾假造修理费单据，欺骗寄售者。在该厂全体职工的要求下，刘岘和王卓君已被停职。
    中央美术学院美术供应社在一九五○年曾承做西北、华北解放纪念章，和有关机关议定每一两黄金镀纪念章四千枚，但实际每两可镀六千枚左右。该社负责人竟布置数人偷窃黄金达二十余两。对于这样有历史意义的纪念品，该社竟采取了卑鄙不法手段牟取暴利，这是令人不能容忍的。一九五一年庆祝国庆节，该社参加了布置天安门会场的工作，也虚报工料，牟取暴利计三千余万元。一九五○年他们承做中国参加德、波、捷国际展览会的展览品及布置工作，因日期短促，任务急迫，向展览会筹备会预支四亿元，订明工作结束后实报实销。结果，工作的实际成本计一亿七千三百五十多万元，却以报假账方式多报了一亿五千多万元，图将四亿元全部报销。中央贸易部不认可，美术供应社派干部百般狡辩后，只退回了四千三百万元。一九五○年该社买铜一批，以涂改单据、造假账的方法，偷漏税款达六千万元。这些违法贪污事件绝大部分都应由美术供应社社长吴劳负责。
    中央电影局北京电影制片厂的贪污、浪费现象也是很严重的。行政处总务科员王权国，在修建工程中贪污共一亿八千多万元，现已逮捕法办。音乐科的作曲者雷振邦，他父亲是个汉奸，他隐匿敌伪财产，盗窃国家资财达一亿元之多。新闻摄影队见习摄影师金鵄，是个共产党员，在西北摄影区队任区队长期间，竟盗骗党的宣传费用五百万元。制片部门，偷盗国家电影器材，如偷胶片，偷药料，偷真空管等现象也很严重。如李进臣盗窃大小放映器材和无线电器材数百件，价值九千六百多万元。
    该厂所属新闻摄影队，动用公款，沾公家便宜，虚报车费，虚报补助费，享受双重供给的现象是相当普遍的。过去摄影师拿公家的胶片私用或送人情，被视为“合法”行为。
    该厂拍摄纪录片，因事先无计划，或事先计划不周密，或工作人员的劳动态度不够认真等原因，以致造成返工浪费，据初步估计损失胶片价值将近三亿元。去年七月，在长芦盐区拍“富饶的盐产”纪录片时，正值盐场休息，但为了要拍一个丰收的大场面，便动员了二百多工人，还有一个文工团，布置了一个大场面。为了拍摄出盐的镜头，把一百吨制好的盐，重新倒到盐池里去。当时工人主张少倒，但拍摄人员坚持全倒，百吨盐全倒入水里后，被工人们抢救出一半，不但损失五十多吨盐，也耗费了六百多个人工。制好的盐倒回盐池后，盐池里的水如再制成盐，味会发苦，色会变黑，不能食用。故原来盐池里的水需要放回海里去，再放新的海水进来，这样又要浪费人工六百个，这次损失的数字是难以估计的。在同部片子里，为拍一个文工团演戏，表示庆祝盐的丰产的镜头，重新布置舞台，人工不算，用布七匹，拍了四个镜头，最后还是拍坏了。为了拍一个献花的镜头，特别从芦台坐火车到天津去买一束花。
    在电影导演人员中，普遍存在着缺乏珍惜国家资财的观念，把艺术工作和经济工作截然分开。有的导演甚至认为作艺术工作是清高的，最好少管钱财或不管钱财。对于摄制一部影片的实际预算、支出和决算，概不审核和检查，把一切应负的经济责任完全推给剧务主任或副导演，甚至把自己的图章也交给剧务或会计，即使在发票上盖个图章也认为是麻烦事。有的导演喜欢用大布景、大场面、以及追求服装、道具的豪华；有的怀着个人目的，想一举成名，把一部教育短片或故事短片硬拉成为长片；有的粗制滥造，摄制草率；有的计划不周，返工浪费。据该厂导演室重点检查“走向新中国”一个影片的浪费，仅现金一项即达该影片全部支出的三分之一以上，计九千多万元，其他器材、物资的浪费尚不在内。
    中国青年艺术剧院，两年以来，演出方面因事先缺乏周密考虑，在布景、服装、道具上有很大浪费，有时把弄好的布景拆掉重搞；有的服装做好不合适，重新再做，浪费达四千八百多万元。交际应酬、请客吃饭，成为风气。连本机关的干部下乡参加土地改革也要请客欢送，从外面工作回来，又要请客欢迎。仅一九五一年就浪费了一千一百多万元。与此相联系的现象，是对于思想领导的忽视，尤其缺乏工人阶级的思想领导。“英雄的母亲”和“太阳光下的星期天”两剧的流产，就是明显的例证。在审查剧本时，审查者对“英雄的母亲”一剧所包含的小资产阶级的思想，采取迁就、妥协的态度，予以通过。为了排演此剧，编导、演员曾到上海、天津工厂去体验生活近两个月。当工人对这个歪曲工人形象的剧本提出尖锐的原则性的批评后，才只好停止排演，为此浪费了八千多万元。据初步统计，两年以来在演出、请客、修建等方面共浪费了二亿三千二百多万元。
    青年艺术剧院吃大公，肥小公，积压了大量物资、器材，在资金积压上所受的损失是无法统计的。为了肥小公，他们拚命往上级机关要钱，在剧院刚一成立时，在三个月中共吃了三百三十个人的空名额。预算用不完的钱，也不上交，而购买布匹存起来，现在积压的花布、白布、绸子等有二万五千六百一十二尺，价值一亿二千六百多万元。乐器的积压也是惊人的，除乐队里的每个人能分三件乐器以外，还剩二百四十七件，价值一亿一千八百多万元。演戏用的灯泡、灯光纸等积存的也很多，现存的东西价值三千七百多万元，即使每天演戏，估计也可用三、四年之久。最严重的是去年向私商庞荫环订制一个电闸板，当时交了订货现金一千万元，至今已十九个月尚未交货。但为了向上级机关领取此项经费，在青年艺术剧院向上级报销的单据里，却有伪造的已交货的单据。这是一种欺骗行为，是把国家的资金，交给私商庞荫环作流动资金使用。据统计，该院两年来共积压各项物资总值三亿三千七百多万元。
    除此之外，该院所属的“文化列车”从东北和南方开回北京时，竟私运大米二万零七百多斤，葡萄酒二百六十四瓶，啤酒七百二十瓶，违反铁路规章，偷漏运费。这些葡萄酒大部分是请客喝掉了。该院所属的农村服务团，到延安放映电影时，违反铁路规章偷运了禁运品汽油。
    该院行政处，业务保管室，乐器、灯光方面的偷窃、盗卖的贪污现象也是很严重的。
    在修建工程方面，不法私商与该院行政处总务科副科长冯世祥等人勾结，以小工充大工，偷工减料，房子刚盖起来就漏雨，楼板裂缝，屋梁弯曲。返工重修是经常有的现象。冯世祥、刘俊民等贪污、受贿，使国家资财遭受巨大损失。
    该院所属青年宫的某些卖票、验票工作人员，用种种办法在戏票上贪污。如吃回笼票、吃包场票，卖重票等。还有本来是卖的个人票，但把个人票放在一起说是团体票，从中贪污折扣部分。这种吃票的贪污现象不是个别的。许多电影院、戏院如首都、胜利等电影院都有类似情形。
    以上种种事实，证明北京文艺机关团体及其所附属的文化企业中，贪污浪费的现象是十分严重的。有些干部已经堕落成和盗骗国家资财的奸商毫无区别。北京文艺机关团体正在更深入、更猛烈地展开斗争，围攻贪污分子，击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
