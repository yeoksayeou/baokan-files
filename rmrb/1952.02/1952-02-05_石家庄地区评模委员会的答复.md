To the Editor: The Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company made errors in determining the yarn supply for the processing of "Planet" cloth by public and private factories. We formed a special inspection team, and after careful and in-depth inspection and calculation, we found that the company had oversupplied 517 bundles of yarn. Due to the factories' cutting corners and using inferior materials, 415 bundles of yarn were lost, causing significant damage to state assets. The main reason for these errors is that the company's leading cadres neglected processing operations in their thinking and lacked political leadership of their subordinates. As a result, lower-level cadres became ideologically numb, their work style was careless, their calculations were inaccurate, and their inspection of finished products was not strict, leading to the overpayment of yarn. We have instructed the responsible comrades of the company to conduct a profound self-criticism and actively seek ways to improve their work.

This time, the evaluation of model workers for managerial-level cadres was mainly based on their grasp of policies, development of business, and completion of tasks. In the specific process, the Model Worker Evaluation Committee hastily approved based only on written materials, without detailed and in-depth understanding and careful evaluation, demonstrating serious bureaucracy. This should be deeply criticized. Since the problem occurred, we have conducted a careful re-examination of the company. We believe that the company has achieved some success in implementing policies and developing business. For example, the company was able to complete its cotton procurement tasks on time, meet the needs of farmers for yarn and cloth, and maintain a relatively stable grasp of policies (such as price policy).

However, regarding the specific issue of miscalculating the yarn supply in processing, the company's leading cadres are indeed guilty of unacceptable bureaucracy. This should serve as a lesson to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.

### 石家庄地区评模委员会的答复

    石家庄地区评模委员会的答复
    编辑同志：石家庄花纱布分公司委托公、私厂商加工星球布，确定的供纱量是有错误的。我们组成专门检查小组，经过细密深入地检查和计算，知道公司在加工当中，多供纱五百一十七捆，因厂商偷工减料损失纱四百一十五捆，给国家资财造成了很大损失。造成以上错误的主要原因，是这个公司的领导干部在思想上忽视加工业务，平时对干部疏于政治领导，因而下级干部思想麻痹，作风粗枝大叶、计算不精、检验成品不严，以致多付了纱。我们已指定公司负责同志进行深刻检讨，并积极设法改进工作。
    这次评选模范工作，经理级的干部主要是以掌握政策、开展业务和完成任务的程度为根据。在具体进行中，评模委员会只根据书面材料，草率地通过，没有详细深入地了解和认真地评选，表现了严重的官僚主义，这是应当深刻检讨的。自问题发生后，我们对这个公司又作了慎重的检查，我们认为这个公司在执行政策、开展业务方面还是有一定成绩的。如公司在收棉工作上能够按期完成任务；在纱布供应上满足了农民的要求；掌握政策（如价格政策）也较稳。
    但就加工中算错供纱量这一具体问题来看，公司的领导干部确实有不可容忍的官僚主义。应该引为教训，以免今后重蹈复辙。
