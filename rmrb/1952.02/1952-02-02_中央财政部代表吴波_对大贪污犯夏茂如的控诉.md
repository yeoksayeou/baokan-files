Central Finance Ministry Representative Wu Bo's Accusation Against Major Embezzler Xia Maoru

Xia Maoru was the engineer and head of the engineering section of the Central-South Grain Administration. He came to the General Grain Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in early December 1951 for a meeting. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he confessed to his embezzlement crimes committed in northern Anhui in 1950, and also reported four engineers and eight construction companies involved in the same case. The situation is as follows:

Embezzlement Facts: He joined the work force in East China in February 1950. Before joining the workforce, he co-founded an architectural firm in Shanghai, serving as an architect himself. Therefore, he had intricate connections with construction companies in Shanghai. After joining the workforce, he was sent to northern Anhui as the director of the engineering office. Four other engineering personnel went with him: Jin Shanshi, Zheng Huafu, Lin Baoquan, and Jin Zhen. The warehouse projects in northern Anhui were contracted through bidding. For the first batch of projects, Xia Maoru introduced Qian Baozhang, the deputy manager of Shanghai Dachina and manager of Niu Yongji, whom he had a relationship with, to take on the contract. After the contract was signed, Xia accepted a bribe of 20 million yuan. However, he pretended to be upright, and Qian Baozhang secretly sent the bribe back to his home. This was the first instance of embezzlement. Second: Because Xia Maoru accepted Qian Baozhang's bribe, he approved more than 20% of the profits for him when reviewing the next project. At the same time, Jin Shanshi approached Qian Baozhang to negotiate rebate conditions, ostensibly agreeing to 30 million yuan, to be divided equally among Xia Maoru, Jin Shanshi, Lin Baoquan, and Zheng Huafu, each receiving 7.5 million yuan. But Qian Baozhang also gave Xia Maoru an additional 10 million yuan. In reality, Xia Maoru embezzled a total of 17.5 million yuan this time. The third instance involved the warehouse construction project in Binghui County, Chuzhou Special District. The contract had already been signed, but the construction site was unsuitable, requiring a change of plan. Xia Maoru seized this opportunity to demand a bribe of 12 million yuan from another contractor, Jichang Construction Company. Once the bribe was received, he helped the contractor proceed with the project by moving the address and signing a supplementary contract. Fourth, after the widespread deployment of warehouse construction in northern Anhui, due to the large tasks and urgent deadlines, engineers led by Xia Maoru took the opportunity to embezzle on a large scale. They introduced seven or eight construction companies to contract the warehouse construction projects in five special districts and the temporary warehouse construction projects of the Huai River Harnessing Committee. Initially, Jin Shanshi suggested taking a 10% rebate from the contractors' contracts. Xia Maoru felt the amount was too large and feared it would be difficult to account for in the engineering work. He dared not take 10%, so Jin Shanshi internally and Qian Baozhang externally negotiated with various contractors, obtaining bribes totaling over 300 million yuan. The five engineers divided this in Bengbu: Jin Shanshi, Zheng Huafu, and Xia Maoru each received 80 million yuan (Xia actually received over 70 million yuan), Jin Zhen received 30 million yuan, and Lin Baoquan received 40 million yuan. However, Lin Baoquan also separately embezzled another 40 million yuan, which was not included. Other engineers, according to Xia's report, also had separate embezzlements, but the amounts are still unclear.

Thus, Xia Maoru embezzled a total of over 120 million yuan. Adding the other four engineers, the total amount of embezzlement is estimated to be over 400 million yuan. The total cost of the warehouse construction projects in northern Anhui, including the temporary warehouses of the Huai River Harnessing Committee, was approximately 10 billion yuan. In addition to the embezzlement by engineers in the form of rebates, there was also the contractors' cutting corners and using inferior materials, estimated to result in losses of over 1 billion yuan. That is to say, of the 10 billion yuan warehouse construction project in northern Anhui, over 1.4 billion yuan was stolen by the collusion of engineers and construction companies, ending up in their pockets.

The most typical example of the criminal behavior of construction companies colluding with engineers to steal state assets is Qian Baozhang. Before contracting the northern Anhui projects, Qian was a bankrupt contractor. Due to the large profits made in the northern Anhui projects, he gained capital and further contracted a batch of cement and galvanized iron from the Huai River Harnessing Committee. After contracting, he made another fortune by illegally reselling materials. As a result, Qian Baozhang established branches and offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Hankou, Changsha, and Hangzhou, becoming a wealthy man. Now Qian Baozhang has been arrested, and the amount of state assets he stole is still under investigation.

Confession Process: After Xia Maoru started working, because he had not yet established a worldview of serving the people, in his mind, engineers embezzling state assets in the form of rebates was considered commonplace. So after he went to northern Anhui, he acted this way in both thought and practice. However, he initially wanted to do it on a small scale and individually. Later, he became bolder and developed into collective large-scale embezzlement. Once it became too big, he was afraid of being exposed and became somewhat frightened. Therefore, he requested to be transferred to work in Central-South, attempting to use the method of transferring regions to conceal this huge embezzlement case for a long time, so that it would not be exposed. But his idea was wrong. Because the project itself would speak, the project of cutting corners and using inferior materials will inevitably have problems. Sure enough, in 1951, many warehouse projects in northern Anhui went wrong, which increased Xia Maoru's panic. He once took 10 million yuan and asked Qian Baozhang to repair the warehouse in order to cover up the matter. But his mental illness did not go away, fearing that he would be exposed sooner or later. Therefore, he thought of changing his name and escaping to Hong Kong, also thought of suicide, also thought of donating the embezzled funds to resist US aggression and aid Korea, but these methods could not let him put down that heavy stinking baggage. When he was at the end of the road, he thought of burying himself in work, thinking of using reading to pass the time. But the shadow of a big embezzler and the thought of the inescapable net of justice still weighed on him, making him unable to settle down. Before coming to Beijing for a meeting, he also heard that someone in the Shanghai Liberation Daily reported that the warehouse construction project in northern Anhui had cut corners and used inferior materials. Although this matter was temporarily covered up, the mental pressure increased. He came to Beijing for a meeting with such a guilty burden. The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement saved him. He saw the call, heard the report, and knew that confession could be reduced. After a fierce ideological struggle, he asked for leave and returned to his home in Shanghai to discuss with his family, and with the encouragement of his family, he decided to return to Beijing to confess. At the same time, he wrote a letter from Shanghai to the Northern Anhui Grain Bureau, admitting that he had embezzled and returning 50 million yuan of stolen money. Before he confessed, he heard the sound of a car when he was sleeping and thought the case was exposed and the government was coming to arrest him; when he saw public security personnel walking in the carriage on the train, he thought they were coming to arrest him. He was uneasy and restless. After confessing, he still had two major concerns: one was that he did not dare to say too bad about himself, and wanted to say more about his achievements, his benefits, and more about objective reasons; this was that although the facts of the embezzlement had been told, he did not dare to face his own sins; second, he knew that confessing could reduce the crime, but he was still very worried about the extent of the reduction. After more than 20 days of ideological struggle and everyone's help, these ideological concerns were lifted, and he thoroughly confessed his sins. He has signed to us that if there is anything inconsistent with the facts in the future, he is willing to be punished more severely.

We believe that Xia Maoru's problem, although he did not have enough understanding of his sins when he began to confess, from the entire confession process, he confessed automatically and reported four engineers and eight construction companies, so the entire case was quickly solved. When he returned to Beijing from Shanghai to confess, he also automatically returned 50 million yuan of stolen money from northern Anhui, and is willing to gradually pay off the remaining stolen money in the future. Therefore, we recommend that the Supreme People's Court Temporary Tribunal, for Xia Maoru's problem, can be leniently handled in accordance with the circumstances of automatic thorough confession, sincere repentance, and reporting other criminals for meritorious self-redemption, so that he can still have the opportunity to be a new person in the future.

    中央财政部代表吴波  
    对大贪污犯夏茂如的控诉
    夏茂如是中南粮食管理局的工程师兼工程科长，在一九五一年十二月初来财政部粮食总局开会。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，坦白了他在一九五○年在皖北所干的贪污罪行，同时检举了和他同案的四个工程师、八家营造厂商。情况如下：
    贪污事实：他是一九五○年二月在华东参加工作的。参加工作前，他在上海和别人合伙开设建筑师事务所，自任建筑师，因此，他和上海的营造厂商有千丝万缕的关系。他参加工作之后，就被派到皖北，担任工程室主任。和他同去的还有金山石、郑华甫、林宝全、金镇等四人，都是工程人员。皖北的仓库工程是招商承包的。第一批工程夏茂如就介绍和他有关系的营造商——上海大中华副经理兼钮永记经理的钱宝章承包，合同订好之后，夏即接受了两千万元的贿赂。但他表面上还伪装清高，而由钱宝章暗地将贿赂送回他家，这是贪污的第一次。第二次：由于夏茂如受了钱宝章的贿赂，所以在审核下一个工程时，就多核给他二成多的利润，同时又借着这个题目，由金山石出面约同钱宝章谈判拿回扣的条件，表面上说好是三千万元，由夏茂如、金山石、林宝全、郑华甫等四人均分，各得七百五十万元，但是钱宝章另外又送给了夏茂如一千万元，实际上这次夏茂如共贪污了一千七百五十万元。第三次是滁县专署炳辉县建仓的工程，合同已经订好，由于建仓地点不合适，需要改变计划，夏茂如就利用这个机会，向另一承包商基昌营造厂索取贿赂一千二百万元，贿赂到手，他就帮助包商用移动地址和订立补充合同的办法，把工程进行下去了。第四次，是在皖北普遍布置建仓之后，由于任务大，时间急，以夏为首的这些工程师就趁机大肆贪污。他们介绍了七、八家营造商来分别承包了五个专区的建仓工程和治淮委员会的临时建仓工程。最初曾由金山石出主意，要在包商合同中拿一成回扣，夏茂如感到数目太大，怕工程上无法交代，还不敢拿一成，结果内面由金山石外面由钱宝章分别向各包商谈判，得了共约三亿元以上的贿赂，由五个工程师在蚌埠瓜分了，金山石、郑华甫、夏茂如各八千万元（夏实得七千余万元），金镇得三千万元，林宝全得四千万元；但林宝全另外还单独贪污了四千万元未算在内。其他工程师，据夏检举亦有单独贪污，数目还搞不清楚。
    这样，夏茂如前后共贪污了一亿二千多万元；再加上其他四个工程师，贪污总数约在四亿元以上。皖北建仓工程连治淮委员会的临时仓库在内总造价约一百亿元，除了工程师们用回扣形式贪污的以外，还有包商的偷工减料，估计损失约在十亿元以上。这就是说，皖北一百亿元的建仓工程，其中有十四亿元以上的款子被工程师、营造商勾结起来进行盗窃，装在他们口袋里去了。
    营造商勾结工程师专门盗窃国家资财的罪恶行为，其中最典型的一个就是钱宝章。钱在承包皖北工程以前，是一个垮了台的穷光蛋承包商，由于在皖北工程中发了大财，有了资本，他又进一步承包了治淮委员会的一批洋灰和白铁皮；承包后，又用套购的办法发了一批财，因此，钱宝章就在南京、上海、北京、汉口、长沙、杭州都设了分号和事务所，变成大富翁了。现在钱宝章已被逮捕，究竟盗窃了多少国家资财，还在继续审讯。
    坦白经过：夏茂如参加工作后，由于他还没有建立起一个为人民服务的人生观，在他的思想里，对于工程师以回扣形式盗窃国家资财，原认为是家常便饭。所以他到皖北之后，从思想到实际都是这样做的，但他最初还是想小干，单独干，后来愈干愈胆大，发展到集体搞大贪污，及至干大了之后，他怕露了马脚，又有些害怕了，于是他要求调到中南去工作，企图用转移地区的办法，使这个贪污巨案长期隐蔽下去，不至于暴露。但是他的想法错了。因为工程本身就会说话的，偷了工减了料的工程必然要发生问题。果然，到了一九五一年，皖北好些仓库工程出了毛病，这就增加了夏茂如的恐慌。他曾拿了一千万元叫钱宝章去补修仓库，以求弥缝了事。但他的心病并没有去掉，怕迟早有一天总要暴露，因而他曾想改变姓名逃到香港去，也想到了自杀，也想到了把贪污款项捐了抗美援朝，但这些办法都不能使他放下那个沉重的臭包袱。在走头无路的时候，他又想着埋头工作，想着拿看书来消磨时间。但一个大贪污犯的影子和法网难逃的恐惧思想仍然压着他，使他安不下心去。在来北京开会之前，他又听说有人在上海解放日报检举皖北建仓工程有偷工减料的行为，虽然这件事暂时弥缝过去了，但精神上的压力是加重了，他是背着这样的亏心包袱来北京开会的。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动把他挽救了，他看到了号召，听到了报告，知道坦白可以减轻，经过思想上的激烈斗争，这才请假回到上海的家里，和家属商量，又得到了家属的鼓励，他才下定决心回到北京来坦白，同时一面从上海写信给皖北粮食局，承认自己有贪污行为，并退回赃款五千万元。他在未坦白之前，睡觉听到汽车响就以为是案情暴露，政府来逮捕他；坐火车看见公安人员走到车厢里也以为是来逮捕他的。他惶惶不安，如坐针毡。坦白之后，他还有两大顾虑：一个是还不敢把自己说的太坏，还想多说一点自己的成绩，自己的好处，多说一点客观的原因；这是贪污事实虽已讲出，但还不敢正视自己的罪恶；第二，坦白可以减罪，他是知道了，但究竟减轻到什么程度，还是很耽心的。经过了二十多天的思想斗争和大家的帮助，这才解除了思想顾虑，把自己的罪恶彻底坦白出来了。他已向我们签了字，如果将来还有与事实不符之处，他甘愿加重治罪。
    我们认为夏茂如的问题，开始坦白时，虽然对自己的罪恶认识不够，但从整个坦白过程来看，他是自动坦白的，并检举了四个工程师，八家营造厂，因而全案得以很迅速的破获。他由上海回北京坦白时，又自动退还皖北赃款五千万元，下余的赃款，亦愿以后陆续还清。因此，我们建议最高人民法院临时法庭，对于夏茂如的问题，可以按自动彻底坦白、真诚悔过并检举其他犯罪分子立功自赎的情节，准予从轻处理，使他今后仍能有重新做人的机会。
