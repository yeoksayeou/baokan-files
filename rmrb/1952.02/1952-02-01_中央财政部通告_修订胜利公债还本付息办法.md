The redemption and interest payment method for the first issue of the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds was announced and implemented by this Ministry on January 29, 1951. Now, due to the unification of currency systems in the Northeast and Xinjiang, Articles 8 and 9 of the original redemption and interest payment method, which concern the issuance of bonds in Xinjiang and the redemption of these bonds in various regions, are revised and announced as follows:

    8.  For bonds issued and redeemed with principal and interest in Xinjiang Province, the local People's Banks in Xinjiang Province will convert and pay in Renminbi according to the exchange rate announced by the People's Bank of Xinjiang Province.

    9.  For the convenience of holders who bring bonds issued in Xinjiang Province to the interior and the Northeast provinces, the local People's Banks in the interior and the Northeast provinces are designated as transfer banks, and the Lanzhou, Xi'an, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai branches of the People's Bank and the Northeast Regional Branch of the Shenyang People's Bank are designated as paying banks. The redemption method is to pay according to the Xinjiang Province exchange rate. The paying banks may pay immediately upon presentation of the bonds. The transfer banks shall issue receipts upon receiving the bonds, and promptly send them to the paying banks by letter. After the paying banks verify that there are no errors, they shall remit the principal and interest due to the transfer banks, who shall then transfer the funds to the bondholders upon presentation of the receipts. For bonds issued in the interior and brought to Xinjiang and the Northeast provinces, the Urumqi People's Bank and the Northeast Regional Branch of the Shenyang People's Bank are designated as paying banks, and will pay according to the exchange rate of the People's Bank of China. The local People's Banks in Xinjiang Province and the local People's Banks in the Northeast provinces are designated as transfer banks, and their transfer methods are the same as above.
