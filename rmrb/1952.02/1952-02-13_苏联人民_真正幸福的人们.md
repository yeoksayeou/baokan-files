    Soviet People—Truly Happy People
    Liu Qing
    Ever since I began to seriously consider the problems of life, I have pondered a question whenever I encounter something that touches my mind in life and in work: how much should a person ask of the world (or collective) and how much should they contribute to the world (or collective) in a lifetime? I pondered this question when I saw the evil landlords and hardworking peasants in the land reform and production movement in the countryside; I pondered this question when I saw the soldiers' arduous lives and heroic battles during marches and battles in the revolutionary war; and I even pondered this question when I encountered material temptations and work difficulties in my daily life. During my two months of travel and visits to the Soviet Union last winter, I was almost constantly moved by the work ethic and attitude to life of the people living in the most advanced social system.

    I have praised the magnificence of Moscow's new buildings, the richness of the Hermitage Museum's collections in Leningrad, the reconstruction of Stalingrad, the Baku oil fields, and the Samgori Irrigation Canal. I thought at the time: if I had visited the paradise built by the Soviet people for themselves several years ago, how much more intense my admiration would have been! But now, after we have overthrown the heinous rule of the imperialist lackeys on the Chinese mainland, my visit is not only filled with excitement but also with exhilaration, because a diligent, brave, and intelligent people of nearly 500 million, with such a wise leader as Chairman Mao, situated on a fertile land in a temperate latitude, and with such good neighbors as the Soviet Union as friends and comrades, what can we not create? People should not only admire the achievements of others but, more importantly, learn the spirit with which they created these achievements. During the two months, I paid constant attention to the actions of the Soviet people I met, and they gave me an unforgettable impression: that is, the active work ethic and simple attitude to life are no longer possessed by a few advanced elements but have become the general level of social morality.

    Everyone knows that the Soviet people's lives are affluent, and food stores and department stores are crowded with people sweating; but you cannot find a person capable of working who is sitting back and enjoying themselves. When I lived in the "Moscow Hotel," the person who came to clean the room every day was a 66-year-old woman, wearing a spotless white apron and headscarf, smiling as she mopped the floor and cleaned the bathroom. After I asked her age, I couldn't help but pay attention to her, thinking that she must be a helpless old woman. Even so, after I thought about the pension system, I still couldn't let go of this question. After a few days, we became familiar, and curiosity prompted me to talk to her about her experiences, to understand why she was still doing this work at such an old age, carrying the tea tray back and forth in the hallway so many times a day. I tried my best to watch her expression, and if she showed any pain, I would not ask further. But my estimate was completely wrong. Using pencils, gestures, and a few Russian words I understood, we clarified the situation: it turned out that she was the elder of a happy family. She had two sons: one sacrificed in the last war; the other, with his wife and children, was working as an engineer in Siberia. Because she didn't like the climate there, she stayed in Moscow. She was not lonely in Moscow either: her eldest daughter worked in a clothing factory, her son-in-law was a teacher in a ten-year school; her second daughter was a university student and didn't need any money from home. She herself had a pension of 150 rubles a month...

    "Then why are you still working?" I thought she probably thought her income was too low.

    But she said, "Because I can work. I have been working here for fifteen years." As she spoke, she seemed so satisfied with her work, giggling.

    As soon as I went out in the Soviet Union, I saw many, many such old women. They were sweeping snow on the sidewalks of the streets, managing the checkroom at the entrances of buildings, taking care of children in nurseries, and selling things in various stores... Their expressions were as cheerful as the old woman in the "Moscow Hotel," and they regarded work and labor as a kind of enjoyment. I once considered the social significance of so many elderly people insisting on working, and the phenomenon I saw elsewhere immediately explained it: that is, the contributions made now and in the future by the countless adults and young people working and studying in factories, institutions, and schools on the economic and cultural fronts for the Soviet state and the Soviet people, also include the merits of those elderly people who participate in minor labor.

    Anyone who has seen the movie "The Village Teacher" knows the spirit of unwavering dedication to one's career. According to the impression I got, that spirit represents the general Soviet attitude towards their careers. The principal of Moscow's Timiryazev District No. 201 School is already in his sixties. He lost an eye in World War I, and was transferred to work at this school a few years after the end of the Civil War, and has been there for more than twenty years. Among his tens of thousands of students, how many valuable people have emerged for the country and the people, even to the point of being Supreme Soviet representatives and Soviet heroes, and the old principal himself is still working tirelessly in this school. He led us to visit every part of the school, explaining the process of expansion of the school, and pointing out to us the orchard he led the students to create through labor. A ten-year school with twenty-four classes, accommodating one thousand two hundred and sixty-four students, running its own vegetable garden and orchard, the old principal is still full of aspirations and explaining the school's expansion plan to us. Seeing the photo of him and his student Zoya (Kosmodemyanskaya) - the great daughter of the Soviet people - watering the orchard together in the hallway, I thought to myself: Zoya and her companions' glorious lives are permeated with the spirit of this old principal.

    I have watched ballet several times at the "Bolshoi Theatre" and have been moved by the gray-haired old musicians. His songs resound everywhere in people's mouths and on records, the description in front of his name prints the glorious title of "People's Artist," and when he appears, the audience in the stalls and the seven or eight layers of boxes applaud thunderously, but he modestly bows to everyone, and then tirelessly waves his arms, conducting four or five hours of music for the ballet. Due to the similarity of professions, I simply forgot to watch the stage, and stared at the music conductor. From his actions, I saw such a momentum: he has already made great contributions to the people, but he does not feel that he has contributed, and still loves this long physical labor.

    When we visited the lock on the Iori River on the Samgori Irrigation Canal in the Republic of Georgia, we were brought to a person whose clothes were as dirty as all the workers on site, who hadn't shaved for a long time, with stubble covering his cheeks, and hands so black that he couldn't shake hands with the visitors. It was introduced that this was the chief engineer of the lock construction. When we visited the underwater oil extraction project in Baku, we met the Deputy Minister of the Petroleum Industry and the Chief Engineer of the oil field on the bridge over the sea. They shook hands with us when they met and said goodbye, apologizing that they came to the sea to deal with a matter and hadn't slept for a day and a night, so they couldn't accompany us to visit. These senior political and technical leaders really get their hands dirty when necessary!

    Work—no matter what position they are in, people are not satisfied with their own achievements and the achievements of the people, and happily and diligently work.

    I used to often hear that Soviet people's work rewards are very high, and the impression I got after going to the Soviet Union is indeed high, because this signifies the wealth of this socialist country. But my complete impression is that the rewards of work are not only calculated in rubles, but more importantly, in honor. This is difficult to imagine for those who ask how much a pound of honor is worth. Honor - talking about honor everywhere, and not much about rubles. At every station along the Siberian Railway, every street I went to, and every workshop in every factory, photos of model figures who exceeded production plans the most are hung everywhere; the best workers have medal after medal pinned to their chests. When visiting the Lenin Collective Farm in Okumi Village, Kaliszki District, near Sukhumi City, Republic of Georgia, we met a family of farmers named Bliskiria. His family has three Socialist Labor Heroes: husband, wife, and their daughter. The annual income is 90,520 rubles, not counting the grain they received. A person only needs 600 rubles a month to live very well. We studied how they could spend their income? They dress the same as everyone else, and there is no special need to expand their houses. They buy national bonds with the remaining money, donate them to orphanages for children whose parents sacrificed in the Patriotic War, help with the construction of public utilities, and entertain visiting journalists and people who come to exchange experiences with them... Someone asked an ordinary farmer with an annual income of 23,000 rubles: "Can you buy a car?" He replied: "If I want to, I can buy it at any time; but I don't want to, because having a car will inevitably hinder work." This is the idea of an ordinary farmer, let alone a Labor Hero.

    I have more deeply realized the following truth in the Soviet Union: if a person works only for money and material things, he cannot do much, just as if a person writes an article calculating the royalties, the article is not worth reading. But if a person does not care about material rewards, and faithfully makes the greatest efforts for the country, the people, and his own honor, he can even create miracles. The same very simple truth: people are not loved just because they are fat and dressed beautifully; but people are respected everywhere for their contributions to the country and the people, and they are even more respected if they are simpler than ordinary people.

    Luxury and work are incompatible. The demand for luxury squeezes out the demand for work in people's minds. Greed for material enjoyment separates people from work and from the collective. If people don't work and don't get close to the masses, what good ideas can they produce in their minds? Leo Tolstoy wrote in his diary on March 18, 1855: "To be a person who always moves towards spiritual goals, consider all his actions according to the principle that 'all behavior that pursues spiritual goals is good behavior.'" Visiting Tolstoy's former residence in Yasnaya Polyana, I was deeply moved by the old man's consistent attitude to life. His wife lived an aristocratic life upstairs, and he wrote "War and Peace" in his father's warehouse downstairs. He changed the iron windows of the warehouse to wooden windows and the damp stone floor to a wooden floor. The four iron rings for hanging things on the south side could not be removed, so he tied ropes to them to exercise his body. It is clear that such a masterpiece as "War and Peace" could not be completed without genius and the spirit of "engaging in intense and extraordinary labor." I visited Tolstoy's former residence in Moscow in winter, and in the main room upstairs, his wife received her aristocratic visitors. Next to this main room was a narrow corridor leading to a small corner room, where Tolstoy received visiting workers, peasants, and intellectuals, just like two families living in the same house. This corridor was opened by Tolstoy because his guests found it inconvenient to pass through his wife's room. The great Russian writer repeated his thoughts in a letter to a friend on October 18, 1905, saying: "Everything that increases or may increase the welfare of the people makes me happy; I cannot sympathize with all those who lack this main goal and make others forget this main goal." The old man, unable to bear the "toxic" life of Yasnaya Polyana, abandoned "irrational luxury" and left, and died in a small station just seven years before the October Revolution broke out. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Bolshevik Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people completely changed the face of the entire country and the consciousness of all the people. I want to use Tolstoy's words to illustrate the spiritual state of the Soviet people I have seen: they are "people who always move towards spiritual goals," and this spiritual goal is communism! They live according to the principle that "all behavior that pursues spiritual goals is good behavior"!

    I want to cite a few huge numbers here: the Moscow Lenin Library alone has a collection of 14.5 million books, with 5,000 readers every day and 8 million books borrowed throughout the year. There are 1,500 staff members working there to serve readers, and it has become one of the important centers of Moscow life. I have been attracted by the Soviet people's love of reading many times: the person in charge of the keys in the hotel sits there reading all day long; the person selling things in the store reads when there are no customers; here and there at the subway station, people sitting on benches or standing waiting for trains are reading; standing on the automatic escalator at the entrance and exit of the subway and looking down, how many men and women are reading. Their time seems to be calculated in seconds. Anyone can talk to you about writers from Pushkin to the most recent winner of the Stalin Prize. I saw novels and poetry collections displayed on bookshelves alongside agricultural technology books in a farmer's home; in the workers' dormitory of the Moscow "Automobile Factory," an ordinary worker unhesitatingly named several modern Chinese writers and their works. One fact is that they are not idle people, but they are greedily pursuing spiritual nourishment. I have asked many people if they have read a certain masterpiece, and the answer is always: "Of course I have read it," and no one shrugs and says: "I am too busy, I haven't read it yet." I remember: five years ago, a Soviet major in Dalian told me that his fourteen-year-old daughter talked to him about "The Young Guard," he was at a loss to cope, and his daughter saw that he hadn't read it, and he blushed; so he squeezed in time to read it in a week, and then turned around and talked to his daughter about the advantages and disadvantages of this book.

    Tickets for an evening of poetry recitation can be sold out in an instant, and those poems cannot make people laugh, but can only make people think deeply; because those poems praise people's heroes, express noble ideals, and call for positive action. People often say that writing poetry requires poetic emotion, so if you go to listen to poetry recitation without poetic emotion, who would spend money to spend several hours in a crowded place? Several times I have watched closely, but I have not found any phenomena of people sitting unsteadily or leaving early. People in military uniforms and people in casual clothes, old and young, men and women, all listened attentively, and then applauded contentedly. Simonov's program was not scheduled for the evening of November 9th, and notes were repeatedly passed up from the audience, forcing him to recite his own works at the end. I clearly felt one thing in the Soviet Union: if there were only bread, butter, beer, and buildings... and no good novels, poems, dramas, movies, and music... how poor people's lives would be!

    This is real—the impression given to me by the small house where Mayakovsky lived during his lifetime is not much different from the impressions given to me by the huge buildings of Moscow University and the Smolny Institute. When the newly born Soviet state was economically difficult after the October Revolution, the government gave this great poet a small house, and he had to prepare the furniture himself. The house was so small that ordinary furniture was not suitable and had to be custom-made. There were two sofas in the outer room. On closer inspection, they were not sofas, but two wider soft benches. Two pieces of striped cloth were nailed to the wall and hung down to cover the benches, looking like backrests. There was a real big sofa in the inner room, but it turned into a bed at night. A small square opening was opened on the door of the wardrobe, and it could be removed to put his shaving utensils. He made a very small desk with a glass top, which could be lifted to take what he needed. All this was because the house was too small; but in this small house, Mayakovsky wrote many immortal poems for the world. He often recited in the masses, and when he was needed, he even acted, regardless of what role he played. We saw a still of him playing a conspirator in his former residence. When I visited, I was completely enveloped in a noble atmosphere of life, as if the poet had not died!

    As a person engaged in literary activities, I regard my two months of travel in the Soviet Union as one of the most meaningful times in my life. There I saw everywhere that people demanded less from the world (or the collective) and tried their best to contribute more to the world (or the collective). These are truly happy people.

    苏联人民—真正幸福的人们
    柳青
    自我开始严肃地考虑起人生问题以来，在生活中和在工作中一遇到触动人思想的事物，我就盘算起一个问题：一个人活一辈子究竟向世界（或集体）要求多少和对世界（或集体）贡献多少才好呢？在农村的土地改革和生产运动中看见罪恶的地主和勤劳的农民，我盘算起这个问题；在革命战争中行军和作战的时候看见战士们艰苦的生活和英勇的战斗，我盘算起这个问题；就是在平常自己遇到物质的诱惑和工作的困难时，我也盘算起这个问题。去年冬天在苏联旅行和参观的两个月，我几乎随时随地被生活在最先进的社会制度里的人们的工作精神和生活态度所感动。
    我赞美过莫斯科新建筑的雄伟，赞美过列宁格勒冬宫陈列的丰富，赞美过斯大林格勒的重建，赞美过巴库油田和萨姆哥尔斯基水渠。我当时想：如果在若干年前我参观苏联人民为自己建设的乐园，我的羡慕之情该是多么激动！但是现在，在我们已经推翻了帝国主义走狗们在中国大陆的罪恶统治以后，我参观的时候内心就不仅是激动而且还满怀着兴奋，因为一个为数近五亿的勤劳、勇敢、智慧的人民，有着毛主席这样英明的领袖，处在纬度适中的丰饶的国土上，又和苏联这样的好邻居是朋友和同志，什么我们不能创造呢？人们不应该光羡慕人家的成就，而更重要的是学习人家创造这些成就的精神。两个月里，我时时注意着我所遇到的苏联人的行动，他们给我造成了这样一种永忘不了的印象：那就是积极的工作精神和朴素的生活态度已经不止为少数先进分子所具有，而是变成社会道德的一般水平了。
    大家知道苏联人民的生活是富足的，到处是食品店，百货店挤得人浑身冒汗；但是你却找不到一个能劳动的人是坐着享受的。我在“莫斯科饭店”住的时候，每天来收拾房间的是一个六十六岁的老太太，她穿戴着洁白的围裙和头巾，笑眯眯地抹地板和打扫浴室。我问过她的年岁以后，不由地注意着她，心里想她一定是一个无依无靠的老人。虽然如此，过后我想起关于养老金的制度，还是放不下这个问题。过了几天，我们熟了，好奇心促使我要和她谈谈她的遭遇，了解她为什么这样大年纪还做这个工作，每天端着茶盘在走廊里过来过去多少次啊。我竭力注意她的表情，只要她一显露痛苦，我就不再往下问了。可是我的估计完全错了。我们借着铅笔、手势加上我懂得的一点俄文单字，谈清了来由：原来她是一个幸福家庭的长者。她有两个儿子：一个在上次大战中牺牲了；另一个带着媳妇和孩子们在西伯利亚做工程师。她因为不喜欢那里的气候，留在莫斯科。在莫斯科她也不孤独：大女儿在被服厂做工，女婿在十年制学校当教员；二女儿是大学生，连一个卢布也不需要家里给。她本人每月有一百五十卢布的养老金。……
    “那么你为什么还做工呢？”我想她大约嫌收入少。
    她却说：“因为我能做工。我在这里做工已经十五年了。”她说着，显得那么满意她的工作，咯咯地笑着。
    我在苏联一出门，就看见许多许多这样的老太太。她们在大街的人行道上扫雪，在建筑物的入口处管理寄存的大衣，在托儿所里看孩子，在各种商店里卖东西……她们的神情和“莫斯科饭店”的那个老太太一样愉快，她们是把工作和劳动当作一种享受。我曾经考虑过这许多老年人坚持工作的社会意义，在另外的地方看见的现象立刻说明了：那就是在工厂里、机关里和学校里工作和学习的无数成年人和青年人，现在和将来在经济战线上和文化战线上为苏联国家和苏联人民所做的贡献，其中也有那些参加轻微劳动的老年人的功绩。
    凡是看过“乡村女教师”电影的人，都知道那种对自己所从事的事业始终不渝的精神。根据我所得到的印象，那种精神代表着一般苏联人对待事业的态度。莫斯科吉姆亮捷夫区第二百零一学校的校长已经六十来岁了，在第一次世界大战中失掉一只眼睛，在国内战争结束几年以后被调到这个学校工作，到现在已经二十几年了。他的成千成万的学生中出现了多少为国家和人民所珍贵的人物，直到最高苏维埃代表和苏联英雄，而老校长自己依然在这个学校里毫不厌倦地工作着。他领着我们参观学校的每一部分，讲解着这个学校扩充的过程，指给我们看他领导学生劳动创造的果园。一个十年制学校，设二十四班，容一千二百六十四个学生，经营着自己的菜园和果园，老校长还毫不满足地充满着憧憬，对我们讲解学校的扩充计划。在走廊里看见他和他的学生卓娅（丹娘）——苏联人民伟大的女儿一块浇果园的照片，我心里想：卓娅和她的同伴们的光辉的生命里渗透着这个老校长的精神。
    我好几次在“大剧院”里看舞剧，都被头发苍白的老音乐家所感动。在人们的嘴里和在留声机片上到处响彻了他所作的歌曲，说明书在他的名字前面印着“人民艺术家”的光荣头衔，他一出现，池座里和七八层包厢的观众掌声如雷，但是他谦逊地向大家一鞠躬，然后毫不疲倦地挥动自己的手臂，为巴蕾舞指挥四五点钟的音乐。由于职业的近似，我简直忘了看舞台，而一眼盯着音乐指挥。我从他的动作中看到这样一种劲头：他对人民已经有了很大贡献，但他并感觉不到他有贡献，而依然热爱着这种长时间的肉体劳动。
    我们参观乔治亚共和国萨姆哥尔斯基水渠在约拉河上的水闸时，被带到这样一个人的面前：他的衣服和所有现场的工人一样脏，好久没刮脸，胡槎爬了两腮巴，手黑得不能和来宾握手，一介绍说这是水闸建筑的总工程师。我们参观巴库海底采油的工程，在海面的桥上遇见了石油工业部的副部长和油田总工程师，他们和我们见面握着手就告别，很抱歉地说明他们到海上来处理一件事务，已经一昼夜没睡觉了，所以不能陪我们参观。这些高级的政治和技术的领导者，在必要的时候，他们真下手干！
    干——无论在什么岗位上的人都是毫不满足自己和人民已得到的成就，愉快地努力地干。
    我过去时常听说苏联人工作的报酬很高，我去过苏联以后得到的印象也的确是高，因为这标志着这个社会主义国家的富。但是我的完全的印象却是：工作的报酬不仅仅拿卢布来计算，而更重要的是拿荣誉来计算。这对于那些问荣誉一斤多少钱的人，是难以想像的。荣誉——到处讲荣誉，而不大讲卢布。西伯利亚铁路沿线的每一个车站，我所到的每一条街和每一个工厂的每一个车间，到处挂着超过生产计划最多的模范人物的照片；最好的工作者胸前挂了一个又一个的勋章和奖章。在访问格鲁吉亚共和国苏呼密市附近卡里斯基区奥库米村的列宁集体农庄时，我们和姓布利斯基里亚的一家农民见了面。他家有三个社会主义劳动英雄：丈夫、妻子和他们的女儿。一年收入九万零五百二十卢布，领到的谷物还不算。一个人生活过得很好每月也只需要六百卢布。我们研究过他们怎样才能把他们的收入花掉呢？他们穿得和大家一样，房舍没有特别扩充的必要。他们把剩余的钱买国家的公债，捐献给为卫国战争中牺牲了父母的孩子们所办的孤儿院，帮助公共事业的建设，招待来访的记者和找他们交流经验的人……我们有人问过一个每年收入二万三千卢布的普通农民：“你可以买一部小汽车啦？”他回答说：“如果我愿意，随时可以买；但是我不愿意，因为有了汽车，难免要妨碍工作。”这是一个普通农民的想法，劳动英雄就更不必说了。
    我在苏联更深刻地体会到这样一个道理：一个人如果仅仅是为了金钱和物质而工作，他是做不出甚么事来的，正如一个人计算着稿费写文章，这文章就没什么读头是一样的。但是一个人如果不计较物质报酬，忠心耿耿为国家、为人民和为自己的荣誉而尽最大的努力，他甚至可以创造奇迹。同样的一条很浅显的道理：人仅仅吃得肥胖穿得漂亮是不能惹人爱的；而人对国家和人民有贡献，他会到处受尊敬，如果他比一般人还简朴，那就更受尊敬。
    奢侈和工作是水火不相容的。奢侈的要求在人的脑子里挤掉工作的要求。贪图物质享受使人脱离工作、脱离集体。人不做工作不接近群众，脑子里能产生什么好的思想呢？列甫·托尔斯泰在他一八五五年三月十八日的日记中写道：“要做一个随时向精神目标前进的人，根据‘凡追求精神目标的行为都是良好行为’这个原则来考虑自己的一切行为。”我参观雅斯亚那·波利亚那的托尔斯泰故居，深深地被这个老人的言行一致的生活态度所感动。他的太太在楼上过贵族生活，他在楼下他父亲的仓房里写“战争与和平”。他把仓房的铁窗子改为木窗子，把潮湿的石地板改为木地板。南半面的四个挂东西的铁环取不下来，他就拴上绳索锻炼身体。很显然，像“战争与和平”这样的巨著，光有天才而无“从事紧张的、非常的劳动”的精神，是不可能完成的。我参观过托翁冬天在莫斯科的故居，在楼上的正房里他的太太接待她的贵族访客。这正房旁边有一条狭窄的走廊通到一个拐角的小房间，在这里托翁接待来访的工人、农民和知识分子，正好像一幢房里住的两家人家。这走廊是托翁开辟的，因为他的客人嫌经过太太的房间不方便。这个俄罗斯的伟大作家在一九○五年十月十八日写给朋友的信里重复他的思想说：“凡增进或可能增进人民福利的一切，都让我感到快乐；凡一切缺乏这个主要目标和使别人忘记这个主要目标的人们，我都不能同情他们。”老人因为不堪雅斯那亚·波里亚那“有毒的”生活，厌弃“无理性的奢侈”而出走，死在一个小车站上刚刚七年以后，爆发了十月革命。苏联人民在列宁斯大林的布尔什维克党领导和鼓舞之下，完全改变了整个国家的面貌和全体人民的意识。我想拿托尔斯泰的这些话来说明我所见的苏联人的精神状态：他们是“随时向精神目标前进的人”，这个精神目标就是共产主义！他们是根据“凡追求精神目标的行为都是良好行为”这个原则过生活的！
    我要在这里举出几个庞大的数字：仅仅莫斯科列宁图书馆就藏书一百四十五万册，每天有五千个读者，全年借出书八百万册。有一千五百个工作人员在那里为读者服务，那里形成了莫斯科生活的重要中心之一。我多少次为苏联人读书的嗜好所吸引：饭店里管钥匙的人成天坐在那里读书；商店里卖东西的在没顾客的时候读书；地下铁道车站的这里那里坐在长椅上或伫立候车的人在读书；站在地下铁    道出入口的自动升降梯上往下看吧，多少男女在读书。他们的时间好像经常是拿秒来做单位计算的。随便一个什么人，可以和你谈论从普希金到最近获得斯大林奖金的作家。我在一个农民家里看见小说和诗集与农业技术书籍一同摆在书架上；在莫斯科“小汽车工厂”工人宿舍里，一个普通工人不假思索地举出几个现代中国作家的名字和作品。一个事实是：他们都不是有闲的人，而是他们在贪婪地追求着精神滋养。我问过很多人看过某一本名著没有，得到的回答总是：“当然看过啦，”而没有人耸耸肩说：“我太忙，还没有看。”我想起：五年以前在大连有一个苏军少校对我说，他的十四岁的女儿和他谈“青年近卫军”，他穷于应付，女儿看出他没有读过，他脸红了；于是他就在一星期中挤时间读了，然后转来和女儿谈这本书的优缺点。
    一个诗的朗诵晚会的票子可以在霎时间一售而光，那些诗不能逗人大笑，只能发人深思；因为那些诗歌颂人民英雄，发抒高尚理想，号召积极行动。人常说写诗要有诗的感情，那末去听诗的朗诵而没有诗的感情，谁花钱在稠人广众中别几个钟头呢？好几次我都密切地注视，但是我没有发现坐不稳的和早退的现象。穿军衣的和穿便衣的，年老的和年轻的，男的和女的，一个个都聚精会神地听着，然后满足地鼓着掌。十一月九日的晚会没有排上西蒙诺夫的节目，台下几次三番递条子，使他不得不在最后朗诵自己的作品。我在苏联清楚地感到一点：假如只有面包、奶油、啤酒和大楼……而没有好的小说、诗、戏剧、电影和音乐……人民的生活该是多么贫穷！
    这是实在的——马雅可夫斯基生前住的小屋所给我的印象不比莫斯科大学和斯摩林斯克大厦的巨大建筑所给我的印象差多少。当十月革命以后新生的苏维埃国家经济困难的时候，政府给了这位大诗人一个小房，家具还要他自己置备。房子是这样的小，以至于普通的家具不适用，必需定做。外屋有两个沙发，仔细一看不是沙发，而是两个较宽的软凳，两块条纹布钉在墙上垂下来盖着凳子，看起来好象是靠背。里屋有一个真的大沙发，但是到夜里就变成了床。衣橱的门扇上开一个小方口，拿开来就可以放他刮胡子的用具。他做了一个玻璃桌面的很小的写字台，揭起来可以取他需要的东西。所有这一切都是因为房子太小；但是就在这小房子里，马雅可夫斯基给世界写下了许多不朽的诗篇。他经常在群众中朗诵，当需要他的时候，他甚至演戏，而不计较是什么角色，我们在他的故居看见他扮演一个阴谋分子的剧照。我参观的时候完全被一种高贵的生活气息所笼罩，好象诗人并没有死！
    作为一个从事文学活动的人，我把我在苏联旅行的两个月当做我生活里最有意义的时间中的一段。在那里我处处看到人们向世界（或集体）要求得少而尽力对世界（或集体）贡献得多。这是真正幸福的人们。
