    National Democratic Parties
    Protest U.S. Military's Germ Warfare in Korea
    [Report from this newspaper] All national democratic parties have unanimously condemned the heinous crime of the U.S. military frantically spreading bacteria in the Korean front and rear.
    The person in charge of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a statement saying: U.S. imperialism attempts to salvage its inevitable military defeat by frantically spreading toxic bacteria in the Korean front and rear. This heinous and bloody crime once again proves that the U.S. invading army is a beast in human skin, and their record of crimes in Korea has added a new chapter. The statement pointed out: An enemy so cruel as to be devoid of humanity is both dragging out the truce talks and preparing for a more brutal war. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of Korea and China, nor is it tolerated by the people of the world. We will certainly inflict the most severe sanctions on the enemy. The statement seriously warned the U.S. aggressors, saying: In violation of human justice and international law, the use of bacteriological weapons to slaughter peaceful residents was what the German and Japanese fascists did in World War II; as a result, the German and Japanese fascists fell, and the peace-loving people of the world stood up. No matter how perverse U.S. imperialism acts, it cannot escape defeat.
    A spokesman for the China Democratic League issued a statement pointing out that the U.S. military's brutal act, which violates human justice and international law, once again proves to the people of the world that U.S. imperialists are cannibals of the twentieth century. However, the U.S. imperialists' attempt to intimidate the people and soldiers of Korea and China with this inhumane act is futile. It will only arouse greater hatred and stronger resistance from the people of Korea and China. The statement called on all peace-loving people around the world to unite and condemn U.S. imperialism and strengthen their efforts to fight for world and Far Eastern peace.
    In his speech, the person in charge of the China National Democratic Construction Association condemned the U.S. military's inhumane crime of waging germ warfare in the Korean front and rear, saying: This conspiracy once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people of China and Korea and all peace-loving people in the world. The U.S. military's heinous crime of conducting germ warfare is truly insane and brutal to the extreme, and can be said to be a rare crime in human history. However, this conspiracy and trick will be futile. Our people of China and Korea, as well as the people of the world, will certainly be able to unite further and repel this brutal and shameless attack. This conspiracy of the U.S. military will only further arouse the unparalleled anger of our 475 million people. The U.S. imperialists' trick is bound to be a shameful failure.
    A spokesman for the China Association for Promoting Democracy pointed out that the U.S. robbers' inhuman and international law-violating crimes will inevitably be subject to the most severe sanctions by the people of China and Korea and the people of the world. It is impossible for it to save its defeat by this. All the aggressive conspiracies of the U.S. robbers, no matter how rampant they are, can only lead to one result, and that is to accelerate its demise.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a statement pointing out that the U.S. aggressors' despicable, brutal, mad, and shameless actions precisely expose their weakness, expose their insufficient military strength, and expose their unwillingness to accept defeat after suffering serious blows. Today, the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union is already incomparably powerful. However, the aggressive camp headed by U.S. imperialism is weakening day by day due to internal contradictions and its increasing isolation in the world. The statement finally solemnly warned the U.S. aggressors: No brutal and shameless act will scare the people of China and Korea and the peace-loving people of the world who have already defeated the U.S. aggressors and are becoming stronger and stronger. On the contrary, the people of China and Korea and the people of the world will surely give the aggressors a more severe blow.
    The person in charge of the China Zhi Gong Party's Beijing office issued a statement pointing out that the U.S. military's inhuman and insane atrocities had been deliberately prepared as early as March 1951, and were jointly planned in collusion with Ishii Shiro, Wakamatsu Jiro, Kitano Masazo and other Japanese imperialist germ warfare criminals who were the mortal enemies of the people of China and Korea. In order to attempt to salvage their irreparable military setbacks on the Korean battlefield, the U.S. invading army dared to carry out this cruel germ warfare regardless of everything. This crime, which completely violates human justice and international law, is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    A spokesman for the Jiusan Society issued a written statement saying that U.S. imperialism, in order to prepare for this inhuman and heinous crime, had long colluded with Ishii Shiro, Wakamatsu Jiro, and Kitano Masazo, major war criminals who had engaged in germ warfare during the Japanese imperialist occupation of China, who were the mortal enemies of the people of China and Korea. These three major war criminals recently arrived in Korea from Tokyo under the orders of the headquarters of General Ridgway, commander of the U.S. invading army, to prepare to use captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's forces as subjects for bacterial experiments. Prior to this, U.S. imperialism had conducted bacterial experiments on captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers more than once. The statement pointed out that this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism is a more blatant manifestation of its aggressive war policy. Since the end of World War II, the criminal activities of U.S. imperialism in the Far East and other parts of the world have been nothing more than a vain attempt to launch a new war of aggression and seize more profits for a few monopoly capitalists. But history proves that all these conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to enslave the world are absolutely impossible to achieve.
    A spokesman for the Beijing office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League pointed out that U.S. imperialism inherited the mantle of the Japanese, German, and Italian fascists, and inhumanely and openly violated human justice and international law, in addition to large-scale insults and abuses of our captured personnel, and also released and spread germ-carrying insects in the front and rear of the Korean battlefield, slaughtering the troops of the Chinese and Korean people and peaceful residents of Korea. This time, the U.S. imperialists released and spread germ-carrying insects in collusion with Ishii Shiro, Wakamatsu Jiro, and Kitano Masazo, Japanese war criminals who were the mortal enemies of the people of China and Korea. When the Gaoshan ethnic group in Taiwan launched the Wushe Uprising in 1930, the Japanese imperialists used a large number of military police to "suppress" it for a month without results, and then used poison gas to exterminate the people of Wushe. New and old hatreds are outrageous! This perverse act of U.S. imperialism will never scare us, nor will it save its military defeat. This insane and barbarous crime of the utmost severity must be severely punished! It must be given a more painful blow.

    全国各民主党派
    抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌
    【本报讯】全国各民主党派一致声讨侵朝美军在朝鲜前线和后方疯狂撒布细菌的滔天罪行。
    中国国民党革命委员会负责人发表谈话称：美帝国主义妄图挽救无法挽救的军事惨败，在朝鲜前线和后方疯狂撒布毒菌。这一万恶滔天的血腥罪行，再次证明了美国侵略军是披着人皮的畜牲，它们在朝鲜的罪恶纪录，从此又添上了新的一笔。谈话指出：残暴到灭绝了人性的敌人，一面拖延停战谈判，一面准备进行更残酷的战争。这是朝中人民所绝对不能允许的，也是全世界人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们必将予敌人以最严厉的制裁。谈话严重警告美国侵略者称：违反人类正义和国际公法，施用屠杀和平居民的细菌武器，在第二次世界大战中，德日法西斯就曾这样作过了；结果倒下去的是德日法西斯，站起来的是全世界爱好和平的人民。美帝国主义者无论怎样倒行逆施，也无法摆脱败局。
    中国民主同盟发言人发表声明指出：美国侵略军这种违反人类正义和国际公法的残暴行为，再次向全世界人民证明美帝国主义者是二十世纪的食人生番。但是美帝国主义者企图用这种灭绝人性的行为来威吓朝中两国的人民和战士是徒劳的。它只有引起朝中两国人民的更大的仇恨和更坚强的抵抗。声明号召全世界爱好和平的人民一致起来声讨美帝国主义，并为争取世界与远东和平而加强努力。
    民主建国会负责人在发言中，痛斥美国侵略军灭绝人性地在朝鲜前线和后方进行细菌战争的罪行称：这种阴谋诡计，又一次证明美帝国主义是中朝人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。美国侵略军进行细菌战争的令人发指的滔天罪行，真是疯狂、残暴到极点，可以说是人类有史以来罕见的罪行。然而这种阴谋、诡计是徒劳无功的。我们中朝人民以及全世界人民一定能够更进一步团结起来，打退这种残暴无耻的进攻。美国侵略军这种阴谋诡计，只有更激动我四亿七千五百万人民的无比愤怒。美帝国主义的诡计是一定会遭到可耻的失败的。
    中国民主促进会发言人指出：美国强盗绝灭人性、违反国际公法的罪行，必将受到中朝人民和全世界人民最严厉的制裁。它要想以此来挽救它的失败是不可能的。美国强盗的一切侵略阴谋，不管它有多么猖狂，只能得到一个结果，那就是使它加速走向死亡。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会为此发表声明指出：美国侵略者的这种卑鄙、残暴、疯狂、无耻的行径，正是暴露了它的脆弱，暴露了它的兵力不足，暴露了它在遭受严重打击之后死不甘心，无可奈何。今天以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，已经是无比的强大。而以美帝为首的侵略阵营，却由于内部的矛盾以及在世界上的日益孤立，一天天地衰弱下去。声明最后郑重警告美国侵略者：任何残暴无耻的行为，是不会吓倒已经击败美国侵略并在日益强大的中朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的。相反地，中朝人民和全世界人民必将给予侵略者以更严厉的打击。
    中国致公党驻京办事处负责人发表谈话指出：美国侵略军这种灭绝人性的疯狂暴行，早在一九五一年三月起就在蓄意准备，而且是勾结了朝中人民的死敌日本帝国主义细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等共同策划的。美国侵略军为了企图挽救他们在朝鲜战场上无法挽救的军事挫败，胆敢不顾一切地进行此种残酷细菌战争。这种完全违反了人类正义与国际公法的罪行，是中国人民和全世界人民绝不能容忍的。
    九三学社发言人发表书面谈话称：美帝国主义为了准备这种绝灭人性的滔天罪行，早就与朝中人民的死敌日本帝国主义占领中国时期进行细菌战的大战犯石井四郎、若松次郎和北野政藏等勾结。这三个大战犯，最近奉美国侵略军总司令李奇微总部之命，从东京到达了朝鲜，准备以朝中人民部队的被俘人员作为细菌实验的对象。在这以前，美帝国主义不止一次地以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行细菌试验。谈话指出：美帝国主义这种滔天罪行，是它的侵略战争政策的更露骨的表现。第二次世界大战结束以后，美帝国主义在远东和世界其他各地所进行的罪恶活动，无非是妄想发动新的侵略战争，为少数独占资本家攫取更多的利润。但历史证明：美帝国主义这一切奴役世界的阴谋，是绝对不能实现的。
    台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处发言人指出：美帝国主义继承日、德、意法西斯的衣钵，灭绝人性地公然违反人类的正义和国际公法，大规模侮辱与虐杀我方被俘人员外，又在朝鲜战场前线和后方，撒放传布细菌的毒虫，屠杀中朝人民部队和朝鲜和平居民。美帝国主义这次撒放传布细菌的毒虫，是勾结中朝人民的死敌、日本战犯石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏进行的。日本帝国主义在一九三○年当台湾高山族雾社起义时，用大量军警进行“镇压”一个月无结果，竟用毒瓦斯消灭雾社的人民。新仇旧恨，令人发指！美帝国主义这种倒行逆施的行为，绝不能吓倒我们，也挽回不了其军事的惨败。这种疯狂野蛮绝顶的滔天罪行，必须受到严惩！必须给以更沉痛的打击。
