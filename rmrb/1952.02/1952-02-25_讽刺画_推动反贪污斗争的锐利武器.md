Caricatures are a powerful propaganda tool in the anti-corruption struggle. In this struggle, propagandists and mass activists in Beijing have created many caricatures. The four districts of the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau alone drew 1,181 pictures before January 31, many of which had clear ideological content and strong combat effectiveness.

Here are a few successful caricatures that expose corrupt elements:

1.  Exposing the Cunning Faces of Corrupt Elements: When the post office corrupt element Bao Shixian confessed to his problems, he hesitated and only talked about the small things while avoiding the big ones. In response to this situation, everyone drew two cartoons for him: one called "Winding Neck," depicting a person with a very long neck, winding several times but still able to look at people head-on; the other called "Talking Small, Not Big," depicting a person carrying a large money cabinet on his back, but only holding a chicken feather in his hand to show everyone. The day these pictures were posted, Bao Shixian confessed to embezzling 30 million yuan.

After confessing to previous corruption problems, Wu Xiqun of Beijing Railway Station stole another 27,000 yuan in passenger ticket money. After the propagandists discovered that the money was missing, they drew a picture: a person throwing down an old baggage and picking up a new one. When Wu Xiqun saw it, he said, "Aren't you pointing at me?" Then he admitted that he was the one who stole the money.

2.  Exposing the Corrupt Elements' Embezzlement Facts: The Only Flour Mill had lost many sacks and flour bags. After the start of the anti-corruption struggle, the propagandists drew a cartoon: a corrupt element secretly throwing many of the public's sacks over the factory wall to the outside. This picture forced Xu Yubin to confess to stealing 55 sacks, more than 70 flour bags, and two balls of thread (worth a total of 2.3005 million yuan).

Before a meeting of the post office trade union group, they first drew a picture for Gao Xizhen, a corrupt element in the general affairs section: a person carrying a large package on his back, containing stolen goods such as housing intermediary fees, chimneys, and kickbacks. Later, Gao Xizhen confessed to the problems one by one, as indicated in the picture. He admitted to embezzling 12.8 million yuan.

3.  Grasping the Ideological Contradictions of Corrupt Elements and Promoting Their Ideological Struggle: Li Ruimin, a corrupt element of the electric power bureau, said to people while eating: "Alas! I don't even enjoy eating stewed meat now." The next day, a cartoon appeared on the blackboard newspaper: a corrupt element wearing a Japanese military coat (Li wore a Japanese military coat) said to people: "Since the anti-corruption movement, I can't eat, I can't drink water, and I don't even enjoy eating stewed meat." The picture prominently wrote: "Think about it: Why don't you even enjoy eating stewed meat?"

When Li Ruimin saw this picture, he said, "Even when I say a word, people know, what's the point of hiding it?" That night he confessed to embezzling 20 million yuan.

4.  Investigating the Activities of Corrupt Elements at Any Time, Following Up and Pursuing. In 1951, a valuable fox fur was lost at Beijing Railway Station. At the beginning of "Tiger Hunting," the leadership proposed that the thief must be tracked down. At that time, the propagandists and Party and Youth League members analyzed the situation together, and believed that Peng Shouhuan, Mu Zhizhong, and Zheng Guanyun from the luggage room and loading and unloading team were the most suspicious. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate the propaganda firepower on these people. The slogan put forward by the propagandists was: "Track and trace, observe facial expressions, and encircle the fox fur step by step."

The "encirclement" began, and the propagandists posted propaganda posters everywhere: a picture of a person being suffocated by a fox, with many hands angrily pointing at him. The picture read "Resolutely Encircle the Fox Fur." After this picture came out, Peng Shouhuan and the other two panicked and held a "grandson meeting" in the luggage room security room when no one was around, but they did not expect to be seen by the propagandists. The next day, cartoons were posted everywhere, with the words: "Holding a grandson meeting, making a grandson contract," and the original words they said were also written on it. At this time, the thieves were even more panicked. Peng Shouhuan and Mu Zhizhong made another "conscience contract," vowing not to confess, but they were accidentally seen by the masses again, and a cartoon followed: two thieves leaning against a large package of fox fur, swearing, and the words "A Conscience Contract Can't Cover Up the Eyes of the Masses" were written in large characters on the picture. At this time, the thieves changed their "tactics," pretending to be "okay," and deliberately cursed in public: "Which grandson took the fox fur, why don't you confess quickly!" Grasping this point, the propagandists drew another picture: a person carrying a large package of fox fur on his back, but hypocritically cursing: "Which grandson stole the fox fur?" The picture also wrote: "Expose his smokescreen!" However, the extremely stubborn thieves were still not aware of their wrongdoing, and they continued to "mobilize" others to "confess" at the group meeting. This time, the propagandists specifically drew a cartoon that was twice as large as before: a person performing magic in front of a large mirror called "Mass Reporting." Although the red cloth used for the magic trick was written with "Clean and Neat, Absolutely No Hidden Goods," the mirror had already reflected the fox fur he was carrying on his back. The picture read: "Stop Pretending, the Problem is All in the Mirror!" Since all the tricks could not be played out, the thieves took out their last "capital" - playing rogue. Zheng Guanyun openly said: "Anyway, I won't reveal the black pot, you can't see the fox fur." At this time, the propagandists immediately "returned" him a cartoon: a person carrying a black pot on his back, with the fox's tail showing from under the pot. The picture read: "Even if the black pot is not revealed, the fox fur is also seen!" In this way, the thieves were completely isolated and had no other options. Under this situation, the propagandists drew another cartoon: two roads unfolded in front of the thieves, one was a bright avenue, and the other was a dark dead end, the name of the picture was: "Don't Get Lost!" This was a great inspiration to the thieves. After the exposure of the cartoon propaganda work and the pressure from the masses, they finally bowed their heads to the masses and admitted that they were the ones who stole the fox fur. When confessing the problem, they said: "Originally, we thought that no one knew about this, but we didn't expect that every move was known to others, especially the cartoons were staring so hard, now we have to confess!"

The more successful caricatures have two characteristics: (1) being targeted; (2) strong firepower. These pictures were all drawn collectively by everyone. For example, the caricature group of Mentougou Coal Mine was composed of two parts. One part of the people is specializing in brainstorming ideas. After grasping the materials, they first study how to draw, and then ask another part of people who specialize in drawing to draft.

However, due to insufficient review, there also appeared a small number of caricatures with ambiguous meaning or no positive significance. For example: China Construction Company Iron Factory portrayed corrupt elements as mice and bureaucrats as cats; the Second District Bank Office drew a tiger with tears in its eyes at the beginning of "Tiger Hunting," said to be because the "tiger" was afraid.

    讽刺画——推动反贪污斗争的锐利武器
    彭静、宝伦
    讽刺画是反贪污斗争中有力的宣传工具之一。在这个斗争中，北京的宣传员和群众积极分子创作了很多的讽刺画。仅北京铁路分局四个地区在一月三十一日前就画了一千一百八十一幅，其中有许多幅具有明确的思想性和很强的战斗性。
    这里，介绍几幅揭露贪污分子比较成功的讽刺画：
    一、揭露贪污分子的狡猾面目：邮局贪污分子鲍世贤交代问题时吞吞吐吐，谈小不谈大。针对这个情况，大家给他画了两张漫画：一张叫“绕脖子”，画着：一个人脖子很长，绕了好几个弯还可以正面看人；另一张叫“谈小不谈大”，画着：一个人背着大钱柜，手上却只拿一根鸡毛给大家看。这画贴出来的当天，鲍世贤就坦白了贪污三千万元。
    北京车站吴锡群在坦白了以前的贪污问题后，又偷了两万七千元的客票钱。宣传员发现丢了钱以后，就画了一张画：一个人扔下旧包袱，又拾起了新包袱。吴锡群一看，说：“你们这不是点我吗？”接着承认了偷钱的就是他。
    二、揭露贪污分子的贪污事实：唯一面粉厂曾丢失了许多麻袋、面袋。反贪污斗争开始后，宣传员就画了一张漫画：一个贪污分子偷偷地把公家的许多麻袋，越过厂子的围墙，扔到外面。这张画迫使徐於斌坦白了偷窃五十五条麻袋、七十多个面袋、两个线团（共值二百三十万零五千元）的事实。
    邮局工会小组在开会前，先给总务股贪污分子高锡珍画了一张画：一个人背着一个大包袱，里面装着房子中费、烟筒、回扣等赃物。后来，高锡珍就按画上指出的，把问题一一交代了。他承认贪污了一千二百八十万元。
    三、抓住贪污分子的思想矛盾，促使贪污分子加强思想斗争：电业局贪污分子李瑞民在吃饭时对人说：“唉！我现在吃炖肉都不香。”第二天，黑板报上画出了一张讽刺画：一个穿着日本军大衣的贪污分子（李穿日本军大衣）对人说：“自从反贪污运动以来，我饭也吃不下，水也喝不下，连吃炖肉都不香。”画上醒目地写着：“你想想：你为什么连吃炖肉都不香呢？”
    李瑞民看到这张画，说：“连我说一句话，人家都知道，我还瞒个什么劲儿呢？”当晚他坦白了曾贪污两千万元。
    四、随时调查贪污分子的活动情况，跟踪追击。一九五一年北京车站丢了一件贵重的狐狸皮。“打虎”开始时，领导上提出一定要追查偷盗分子。当时，宣传员和党、团员们在一起分析了情况，认为行李房和装卸班的彭寿轩、穆智忠、郑观澐嫌疑最大。因此决定把宣传火力集中到这几个人身上。宣传员们提出的口号是：“跟踪追迹，查颜观色，步步逼紧围剿狐狸皮。”
    “围剿”开始了，宣传员在各处张贴了宣传画：画了一个人被狐狸压得透不过气来，旁边有很多只手怒指着他。画上写着“坚决围剿狐狸皮。”这幅画出来以后，彭寿轩等三人很慌张，乘人不在，在行李房门纪室开了“孙子会”，但是没想到被宣传员看见了。第二天到处又贴满了漫画，画上写着：“开孙子会，订了孙子合同”，把他们说的原话也写上了。这时，盗窃分子更着慌了。彭寿轩和穆智忠又订了“良心合同”，死不坦白，但是不留神又叫群众看见了，紧跟着漫画出来了：画了两个盗窃分子靠着狐狸皮的大包袱发誓，画上用大字写着“良心合同也遮不住群众的眼睛。”这时，盗窃分子转变了“战术”，装作“没事”，在群众场合故意咒骂：“哪个孙子把狐狸皮拿走了，还不赶快承认！”抓住这一点，宣传员又画了一张画：上面画的是一个人背后扛着狐狸皮大包袱，嘴里却假惺惺地咒骂着：“哪孙子把狐狸皮偷去了？”画上并写着：“揭穿他的烟幕弹！”但是，十分顽固的盗窃分子还不觉悟，他们在开小组会时仍喋喋不休地“动员”别人“坦白”。这次宣传员特地画了一张比以前篇幅大一倍的漫画：一个人在名为“群众检举”的大镜子前变戏法，变戏法用的红布上虽然写着“干净利落、绝没夹带”，但是镜子里已经反射出了他背后背着的狐狸皮，画上写着：“别装蒜了，毛病全在镜子里呢！”一切花招既都耍不开；盗窃分子就拿出了最后的“老本钱”——耍赖皮。郑观澐公开说：“反正不揭黑锅，你们看不见狐狸皮。”这时宣传员马上就“回敬”给他一幅漫画：一个人背着黑锅，锅的下面露出了狐狸尾巴。画上写着：“黑锅不揭，也看见了狐狸皮！”这样，盗窃分子就完全孤立，再也无计可施了。在这种情况下，宣传员又画出一幅漫画：两条路在盗窃分子的面前展开，一条是光明的大道，一条是黑暗的绝路，画的名字叫做：“不要迷了路！”这对盗窃分子是很大的启发，经过漫画宣传工作的揭露和群众的压力，他们终于向群众低了头，承认狐狸皮就是他们偷的。交代问题时，他们说：“原先我们以为谁也不知道这回事，可是没想到一举一动，人家都知道了，尤其是漫画盯的实在厉害，现在我们是不得不坦白了！”
    比较成功的讽刺画有两个特点：（一）有的放矢；（二）火力强。这些画都是由大家集体画出来的，如门头沟煤矿的讽刺画组是由两部分人组成的。一部分人是专门出主意的，他们在掌握材料以后，先研究一下怎样画，然后就请另一部分专门画的人起草。
    但由于审查不够，也出现了少数意义模糊或没有积极意义的讽刺画。如：中国建筑公司铁工厂把贪污分子画成老鼠，官僚主义者画成猫；二区银行办事处在“打虎”开始时画了一只老虎，眼里含着泪，据说是“老虎”害怕了。
