Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 16th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session and issued an open letter to the people, pointing out that the strength of the French people has become greater, and calling on the people of the whole country to unite and act in unison to step up the struggle for the realization of a policy of peace and national independence.
    In its open letter to the people, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party first pointed out that a massive mass movement against American aggression has already unfolded in France. The French government is encountering increasing difficulties in implementing a war policy that is fatal to France. Even the Americans have begun to doubt whether they can force the French people to agree to the American occupation of France and the implementation of a policy of aggression and war preparations. America's policy of aggression is making the French people increasingly impoverished. The French working class hates the rise in prices and the continuous decline in purchasing power, hates the shameful increase in capitalists' profits and military spending; they demand the establishment of a system of wage adjustment based on prices. French farmers oppose the widening scissors differential between agricultural and industrial products. Artisans and merchants are also deeply disturbed by sluggish sales and the threat of monetary crisis. Everyone opposes the ever-increasing tax burden and the American obstruction of French trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The colonial people, regardless of the barbaric repression such as that taking place in Tunisia, are fighting for independence, making it increasingly difficult for the imperialists to maintain their rule.
    The French proletariat is proud of the anti-fascist political general strike of February 12th. They are the defenders of life, they are stronger than those who incite massacre. All French men and women already have a new basis for uniting and acting in unison.
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party then put forward the battle slogans: All good French men and women, regardless of political and religious beliefs, regardless of social status, unite and act in unison to fight for the expansion and strengthening of the peace movement! Fight against the arming of West Germany and against the restoration of the Hitler war machine! Do not let the United States take away the nationality of the French army, do not allow the United States to use French troops for aggression! Stop the American occupation of France and restore France's independence! Stop the war in Indochina! Stop the massacres and repression in Tunisia, withdraw all troops and expeditionary forces! Strive for disarmament and the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact! Strive to restore France's economic relations with other countries on the basis of equality! Defend the bread of the working people and abolish the war economy!
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party finally emphasized: Doing everything possible to expand the unity of action of the working class is the condition for victory and the guarantee that all peace forces and national forces can unite broadly. This unity will certainly crush all American aggression plans.

    法共号召法国人民争取和平与民族独立
    反对重新武装西德，不准美国利用法国军队进行侵略
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议发表告人民书，指出法国人民的力量已更加强大，并号召全国人民联合起来一致行动，为实现和平与民族独立的政策而加紧斗争。
    法国共产党中央委员会在告人民书里首先指出：目前在法国已经展开了反对美国侵略的声势浩大的群众运动。法国政府在执行致法国死命的战争政策时，已遇到越来越大的困难。甚至美国人也已经开始怀疑是否能够强迫法国人民同意美国占领法国、实行侵略和备战的政策。美国的侵略政策使法国人民日益贫穷。法国工人阶级痛恨物价的上涨和购买力的不断降低，痛恨资本家的利润和军事支出的可耻增加；他们要求建立按物价调整工资的制度。法国农民反对让农产品和工业品的剪刀差越来越大。手工业者和商人也因货物滞销和货币危机的威胁而深感不安。一切人都反对不断增加的赋税负担，反对美国阻挠法国和苏联及人民民主国家的贸易。殖民地人民不顾像在突尼斯进行的那种野蛮镇压，正在为独立而斗争，使帝国主义者越来越难以维持他们的统治。
    法国无产者以二月十二日的反法西斯政治性大罢工自豪。他们是生命的保卫者，他们比煽动屠杀的人们更强有力。法国全体男女已经有着联合起来、一致行动的新基础。
    法国共产党中央委员会接着提出战斗口号：一切善良的法国男女，不分政治和宗教信仰，不分社会地位，联合起来，一致行动，为扩大和加强和平运动而斗争！为反对武装西德、反对恢复希特勒战争机构而斗争！不让美国夺去法国军队的民族性，不许美国利用法国军队进行侵略！制止美国对法国的占领，恢复法国的独立！制止印度支那的战争！制止在突尼斯的屠杀和镇压，撤回一切军队和远征军！争取裁减军备、缔结五大国和平公约！争取在平等的原则上恢复法国和其他国家的经济关系！保卫劳动人民的面包，废除战争经济！
    法国共产党中央委员会最后着重指出：尽一切可能扩大工人阶级的行动统一，是胜利的条件，是一切和平力量和民族力量能够广泛联合的保证。这种联合，一定能粉碎美国的一切侵略计划。
