    Ningxia Province Overcomes Right-Leaning Thought in Anti-Corruption Movement; Commerce Department Head Hao Huairen Removed from Post for Resisting Movement; Now Reorganizing and Concentrating Efforts to Pursue Major Corrupt Officials

    After overcoming right-leaning thought in the anti-corruption movement, Ningxia Province's provincial-level organs have begun to concentrate all efforts on attacking major corrupt officials. Li Jinglin, Acting Secretary of the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, deeply reviewed the provincial committee's past errors of not seriously leading this movement, began to personally lead the movement forward, and resolutely removed certain leading cadres who suppressed democracy and resisted the anti-corruption movement.

    The right-leaning thought in the Ningxia Province anti-corruption movement was reversed at the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee held by the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on February 7th and 8th. This meeting was very successful, as Comrade Li Jinglin said at the meeting: "This is the first time since the liberation of Ningxia that senior cadres have launched a fierce ideological struggle with each other and examined the errors in leadership thought and work style." The meeting focused on reviewing and examining the reasons why the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in various organs had not yet formed a vigorous mass movement, correcting the right-leaning thought that "Ningxia is poor, there are no major problems"; and fiercely struggled against erroneous behaviors such as the lack of importance attached to the anti-corruption movement by Lei Enjun, Director of the Provincial Industry Department, and the suppression of democracy and resistance to the anti-corruption movement by Hao Huairen, Director of the Provincial Commerce Department.

    Lei Enjun spent three days mediating private disputes between two cadres, but ignored such a major political task as the anti-corruption movement. Regarding this serious situation, Xing Zhaotang, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, criticized him at a certain meeting and ordered Lei Enjun to effectively lead the anti-corruption movement. However, Lei Enjun did not specifically organize the masses to carry out a resolute struggle against corrupt elements, and continued to get bogged down in some "trivial" issues. He also did not organize forces to deeply pursue the clues of corrupt behavior of certain responsible cadres raised by the masses, but subjectively believed: "Old comrades, probably no problem." When the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting determined the plan for the provincial organs to besiege major corrupt officials, Lei Enjun did not dare to boldly propose a plan for the Industry Department to fight "tigers," fully exposing the right-leaning thought of not being determined to implement the anti-corruption movement. At the meeting, comrades openly exposed Lei Enjun's errors and conducted sharp criticism and analysis. Lei Enjun made a public self-criticism at the meeting, recognizing that not attaching importance to the anti-corruption movement was a concrete manifestation of his weak Party spirit, and was also caused by his personal lack of attention to learning and carrying the burden of being an "old timer." Lei Enjun said: "I am determined to correct my mistakes and guarantee to the Party: to complete the task within the time limit, so that the anti-corruption movement in the Industry Department can catch up, and if I fail to complete the task assigned by the Party, I am willing to be subject to Party disciplinary action."

    Hao Huairen, Director of the Provincial Commerce Department, was arrogant and complacent, carrying the burden of having joined the Communist Party in the era of the Great Revolution, unwilling to accept criticism from subordinates, engaged in private collusion, formed small cliques, and attacked and excluded cadres who adhered to the truth and dared to criticize him, making it impossible for the Commerce Department to promote democracy and carry out criticism, and allowing unhealthy tendencies to overwhelm righteousness. Regarding this series of errors, the masses had previously filed complaints in anonymous letters last year. At that time, the Party branch of the Commerce Department held a sixty-hour meeting to discuss the matter, criticize Hao Huairen's errors, and patiently persuade and educate him. Hao Huairen verbally expressed "agreement" with the organization's criticism, but actively worked behind the scenes to resist the organization's criticism, saying that the Ningxia Provincial Party Committee's criticism of him was "falling for the tricks of special agents," and groundlessly demanded that the organization "admit its mistakes" to him. After the anti-corruption movement began, he not only did not boldly mobilize the masses and deeply review his own mistakes, but instead obstructed subordinates from making suggestions to leaders. When the Provincial Party Committee decided to have Su Xiaomeng, Director of the Personnel Department, help the Commerce Department carry out the anti-corruption movement, Hao Huairen also expressed dissatisfaction, and called the mobilization by leading comrades to implement the anti-corruption movement "crazy" and "wanting to harm cadres." More seriously, after the masses used anonymous letters to accuse Wang Hongjun, manager of the Provincial Southern Branch of the Ningxia Provincial Trading Company, of corruption and waste, Hao Huairen did not conduct an in-depth investigation, but told the leadership: "This is another trick by special agents to frame our cadres!" At the same time, he transferred Wang Hongjun to Yinchuan and, together with He Zhizhong, secretary of the Commerce Department (secretary of the Party branch of the Commerce Department), etc., wrote a letter to the Ningxia Provincial Party Committee, openly resisting the organization. The Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting severely criticized this series of serious errors of Hao Huairen. However, Hao Huairen not only did not deeply examine his mistakes, but also deceived the organization and shielded his own errors. In order to remove the stumbling block hindering the movement and fully mobilize the masses, the Ningxia Provincial Party Committee decided to immediately reorganize the Party Branch Committee of the Commerce Department in order to thoroughly correct the errors of the leading cadres of the Commerce Department in suppressing democracy and resisting the anti-corruption movement. On February 9, the joint meeting of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government Administrative Meeting and the Provincial Consultative Committee passed a resolution to remove Hao Huairen from the posts of member of the Provincial People's Government and Director of the Commerce Department, to be reported to the Northwest Military and Political Committee and then to the Central People's Government Political Affairs Council for approval, and immediately transferred Hao Huairen away from the Commerce Department for investigation, with Shi Zizhen, Deputy Director of the Provincial Finance and Economic Committee, temporarily acting as Director of the Commerce Department; At the same time, it was decided that He Zhizhong, secretary of the Commerce Department, should be suspended from his duties to conduct introspection; Wang Hongjun, manager of the Provincial Southern Branch of the Provincial Trading Company, refused to confess, suppressed democracy, resisted the organization, and resisted the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and was immediately dismissed and investigated.

    In order to earnestly implement the instructions of the higher authorities, the meeting decided to reorganize the ranks in the organs, launch a struggle to catch major corrupt officials, and launch a struggle against bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of national economic intelligence in the industrial and commercial circles.

    Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, Comrade Li Jinglin served as the general commander of the provincial organs' siege of major corrupt officials, specifically directing and organizing the team, and personally going to the organs with the most problems to conduct inspections. Under the leadership of Comrade Li Jinglin, various provincial-level organs in Ningxia have organized "tiger hunting teams" to launch fierce attacks on major corrupt officials.

    宁夏省克服反贪污运动中的右倾思想
    商业厅长郝怀仁抗拒运动被撤职
    现正重整旗鼓集中力量追捕大贪污犯
    宁夏省省级机关在克服反贪污运动中的右倾思想以后，已开始集中全力向大贪污犯攻击。中共宁夏省委代书记李景林深刻检讨了省委过去没有认真领导这一运动的错误，开始亲自领导运动前进，并坚决撤销了压制民主和抗拒反贪污运动的某些领导干部的职务。
    宁夏省反贪污运动中的右倾思想是在中共宁夏省委在二月七、八两日召开的省委扩大会议上扭转的。这次会议开得很成功，正如李景林同志在会上所说：“这是宁夏解放以来，高级干部之间，第一次相互展开了激烈的思想斗争，检查了领导思想上和作风上的错误。”会议着重检讨和检查了各机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还没有形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动的原因，纠正了认为“宁夏穷，没有大的问题”的右倾思想；对省工业厅厅长雷恩钧不重视反贪污运动和商业厅厅长郝怀仁压制民主和抗拒反贪污运动等错误行为，进行了激烈的斗争。
    雷恩钧为了调解两个干部的私人纠纷，费了三天时间，而对反贪污运动这样重大的政治任务却不去理睬。对这种严重情况，省人民政府邢肇棠主席曾在某次会议上进行过批评，并责成雷恩钧切实领导反贪污运动。但雷恩钧没有具体地组织群众向贪污分子进行坚决的斗争，仍纠缠在一些“鸡毛蒜皮”的问题上，对群众提出的某些负责干部有贪污行为的线索也没有组织力量深追，反而主观地认为：“老同志，大概没问题。”在省委扩大会议确定省级机关围攻大贪污犯计划时，雷恩钧也不敢大胆提出工业厅打“老虎”的计划，充分暴露了没有决心贯彻反贪污运动的右倾思想。会上，同志们公开揭发了雷恩钧的错误，进行了尖锐的批评和分析。雷恩钧在会上进行了公开检讨，认识到不重视反贪污运动是自己党性不强的具体表现，也是个人平时不重视学习，又背着“老资格”的包袱所造成的。雷恩钧表示：“决心改正错误，并向党保证：限期完成任务，使工业厅反贪污运动迎头赶上，如果完不成党所分配的任务，愿受党的纪律处分。”
    省商业厅厅长郝怀仁骄傲自满，背着自己是大革命时代加入共产党的包袱，不愿接受下面干部的批评，并进行私人拉拢，结成小宗派，打击和排斥坚持真理敢于批评他的干部，使商业厅不能发扬民主，不能开展批评，歪风压倒了正气。对这一系列的错误，去年群众曾用匿名信件提出控告，当时商业厅党支部曾召开过六十小时的会议进行了讨论，批评了郝翽怀仁的错误，进行了耐心的说服教育。郝怀仁口头上表示“同意”组织的批评，但在背后却积极活动，反抗组织对他的批评，说宁夏省委批评他是“上了特务分子的当”，并毫无理由地要求组织向他“承认错误”。在反贪污运动开始后，他不仅没有大胆放手发动群众和深刻检讨自己的错误，反而阻碍下面干部向领导人提意见，省委决定由人事厅厅长苏晓蒙帮助商业厅进行反贪污运动，郝怀仁也表示不满，并把领导同志动员贯彻反贪污运动叫做“疯狂”，“想害干部”。更严重的是，群众用匿名信件控告宁夏省贸易公司省南分公司经理王鸿翽贪污、浪费行为后，郝怀仁没有深入调查，就向领导方面说：“这又是特务在搞我们干部的鬼哩！”同时把王鸿翽调到银川，会同商业厅秘书主任何治中（商业厅党支部书记）等，向宁夏省委写了一封信，公开反抗组织。对郝怀仁这一系列的严重错误，省委扩大会议上提出严厉批评。但郝怀仁不仅不深刻检讨错误，反而欺骗组织，包庇自己的错误。为了搬掉阻挠运动的绊脚石，充分发动群众，宁夏省委决定立即改组商业厅党支部委员会，以彻底纠正商业厅领导干部压制民主、抗拒反贪污运动的错误。二月九日，宁夏省人民政府行政会议和省协商委员会联席会议通过撤销郝怀仁省人民政府委员、商业厅厅长的职务，呈报西北军政委员会转报中央人民政府政务院批准，并立即把郝怀仁调离商业厅进行审查，由省财政经济委员会副主任石子珍暂时代理商业厅长；同时决定商业厅秘书主任何治中停职反省；省贸易公司省南分公司经理王鸿翽拒不坦白，又压制民主，反抗组织，抵制反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，即撤职查办。
    为切实贯彻上级的指示，会议决定在机关中重整旗鼓，展开捉大贪污犯的斗争，并在工商界展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财，反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。
    在党委统一领导下，李景林同志担任省级机关围攻大贪污犯的总指挥，具体指导和组织队伍，并亲自到问题最多的机关进行检查。宁夏省级各机关，已在李景林同志率领下，组织“打虎队”，向大贪污犯进行猛烈的攻击。    （崔岭）
