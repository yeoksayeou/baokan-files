The Sino-Soviet Alliance is a Powerful Force for Defending Peace
P. Marinina
Chairman of the "October 12th" Collective Farm, Soviet Union
Hero of Socialist Labor, Stalin Prize Laureate

Last October, as a member of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee delegation, I participated in the celebrations of the Second National Day of the People's Republic of China. My trip to the People's Republic of China left me with a very deep impression. The populous Chinese people are building a happy new life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Mao Zedong. The trip to China filled me with pride for their achievements.

After returning to my motherland, I reported to the collective farm members about my impressions of my trip to China. I told them about the large-scale construction work of the peace-loving Chinese people, their amazing achievements, and the advanced individuals who had achieved amazing indicators in their work and were loved and respected by the people of the whole country for their exemplary work. I told the comrades in our collective farm how warmly our Chinese friends received us—the envoys of the Soviet Union, and how enthusiastically they advocated strengthening the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

After listening to my speech, the collective farm members expressed their sympathy for the great Chinese people and wished them further achievements in building a truly democratic country and in the struggle against the aggression of American and British imperialism and for peace and friendship among all nations.

The members of the "October 12th" Collective Farm, like all the people of the Soviet Union, are paying attention to the events taking place in China, the development of China's economy and culture, and the struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army side by side against the American bandits. We not only read books about China written by Soviet people, but also carefully pay attention to every new book by Chinese writers published in Russian. We also learn about the lives of our Chinese friends from Chinese films. Not long ago, we watched the Chinese film "The White-Haired Girl."

One cannot help but be sincerely moved after watching this film, because it truthfully and seriously narrates the fate of Chinese peasants in the past. The glorious images of Xi'er, Dachun, and other Chinese patriots evoke a feeling of pride in the freedom-loving Chinese people and the achievements of the People's Republic of China.

We Soviet people unanimously and enthusiastically support our government's policy of providing fraternal assistance to our great neighbor in developing and restoring its economy. We welcome our government's policy, which is vividly embodied in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. We are pleased to commemorate the second anniversary of this treaty, which in fact demonstrates that it has transformed Sino-Soviet friendship into a great force in strengthening the cause of world peace, a force that no force can compare with, either now or in human history. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is in the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union. This treaty is also in the interests of all peace-loving people, because it strengthens the democratic and progressive camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Every member of our "October 12th" Collective Farm participates in the permanent work shifts in the struggle for peace, against imperialist national oppression, and for friendship among all nations. We work tenaciously and smoothly, developing our public economy with all our strength, increasing the wealth of the collective farm, and striving to obtain a bumper harvest. The Soviet people live in the great Stalin era—an era of completing the construction of a socialist society and gradually transitioning to communism. We are active participants in this great construction. The Soviet government highly appreciates the slight contribution we make to the cause of all the people. Twelve members of the "October 12th" Collective Farm have been awarded one of the most glorious titles of the Soviet Union—Hero of Socialist Labor, and 180 others have received medals and awards. We engage in labor with joy to consolidate the power of our socialist motherland. We regard the power of the great socialist power as a guarantee of security, freedom, and happiness not only for us Soviet people, but also for all freedom-loving nations.

The alliance between the Soviet people and the Chinese people raises the noble struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, for freedom and independence, and for the happiness of the people of all countries to a new and higher stage. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a powerful force for defending the cause of peace!

    中苏同盟是保卫和平的强大力量
    苏联“十月十二日”集体农庄主席
    社会主义劳动英雄、斯大林奖金获得者
    普·马里宁娜
    去年十月，我作为苏联保卫和平委员会代表团的一员，参加了中华人民共和国第二届国庆节庆祝典礼。到人民中国去过一趟，给我留下了极为深刻的印象。人口众多的中国人民正在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导之下，建设着幸福的新生活。中国之行引起了我为他们的成就而骄傲的感情。
    回到祖国以后，我向集体农庄庄员们报告了自己到中国一趟所得的印象。我把爱好和平的中国人民的规模宏大的建设工作，把他们的惊人的成就，把那些在工作中达到惊人的指标并因自己的模范工作而获得全国人民爱戴与尊敬的先进人物告诉了他们。我讲给我们集体农庄内的同志们听：中国朋友们怎样热烈地接待我们——苏联的使者们，他们怎样热烈地主张加强苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民的友谊。
    听了我的讲话以后，集体农庄庄员们都表示了自己对于伟大的中国人民的同情，并祝望中国人民在建设真正的民主的国家中，在反对美英帝国主义侵略、争取各民族间的和平与友好的斗争中获得更进一步的成就。
    “十月十二日”集体农庄的庄员们，和全苏联的人民一样，关注着中国所发生的事件，关注着中国的经济和文化的发展，关注着中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军队并肩反抗美国强盗的斗争。我们不仅读着苏联人所写的关于中国的书，并且也细心地注意着译成俄文出版的中国作家们底每一本新书。我们也从中国影片中来熟识中国朋友的生活。不久以前我们看了中国影片“白毛女”。
    看了这部影片不能不有真挚的情绪激动，因为它真实而严肃地叙述了中国农民昨天的命运。喜儿、大春以及其他中国爱国者的光荣的形象，使我们对于爱好自由的中国人民，对于中华人民共和国的成就发生了骄傲的感觉。
    我们苏联人一致热烈支持我们政府的政策，即给予我们伟大的邻邦在发展和恢复它的经济上以兄弟般的帮助的政策。我们欢迎我国政府的政策，这个政策鲜明地表现在中苏友好同盟互助条约里。我们高兴地纪念这个条约的二周年，它在事实上说明，它把中苏友谊变成为在加强全世界和平的事业中的伟大的力量，这种力量，不论是现在或是在人类历史中都没有一种力量可以与之相比。中苏友好条约是符合中苏两国人民的根本的利益的。这一条约也符合所有的爱好和平的人民的利益，因为它加强了以苏联为首的民主和进步的阵营。
    我们“十月十二日”集体农庄的每一个庄员，都参加了争取和平、反对帝国主义的民族压迫、争取各民族友好的斗争的永久工作班。我们顽强地、顺利地劳动着，以全力发展我们的公有经济，增加集体农庄的财富和争取获得丰收。苏联人民生活在伟大的斯大林时代——完成社会主义社会的建设并逐步过渡到共产主义的时代。我们是这一伟大建设的积极参加者。苏维埃政府对于我们给全体人民事业的些微贡献予以高度的评价。“十月十二日”集体农庄有十二个庄员获得了苏联的最光荣的称号之一——社会主义劳动英雄，还有一百八十人获得勋章和奖章。我们欢欣鼓舞地从事劳动，来巩固我们社会主义祖国的威力。我们把伟大的社会主义强国的威力看作不仅是我们苏联人的，并且也是所有的爱好自由的民族的安全、自由和幸福的保障。
    苏联人民和中国人民的同盟，将各国人民争取全世界和平、争取自由和独立、争取各国人民幸福的高贵的斗争提高到新的更高的阶段。中苏友好同盟互助条约是保卫和平事业的强大力量！
