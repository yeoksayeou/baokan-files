According to incomplete statistics, Shandong Province added more than 110,000 water wells last year, and loaned more than 25,000 waterwheels. In many areas, with well irrigation, the unit area yield of crops increased by about 100% compared with previous years.

In the past year, governments at all levels in Shandong vigorously promoted well-digging and waterwheel loans. Various places used practical examples to widely publicize the benefits of well-digging to farmers. Feicheng County held meetings of people's representatives from all walks of life and farmer representatives for this purpose. The fact that farmer Yu Guizhou in Laiyang County achieved bumper harvests by digging wells was widely spread in the Laiyang area last year, resulting in an increase of more than 20,000 water wells in the entire area last year. Last year, the Shandong Branch of the People's Bank of China loaned a total of 19.75 billion yuan for well-digging and waterwheels. Cooperatives in various places supplied a large amount of well-digging equipment. Governments at all levels also sent some technicians for well-digging and waterwheel installation to the countryside to help farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东去年打井十一万多眼
    旱地变水田产量提高一倍
    据不完全的统计，山东全省在过去一年中增加了十一万多眼水井，贷出了二万五千多部水车，很多地区有了水井灌溉，农作物的单位面积产量比往年提高了约一倍。
    去年一年，山东各级人民政府曾大力推广打井和贷放水车。各地都曾用实际事例向农民广泛宣传打井的好处，肥城县为此曾开过各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议。莱阳县农民于桂舟打井丰产的事实去年在莱阳专区普遍传播的结果，全专区去年就增加了两万多眼水井。去年，中国人民银行山东省分行共贷放了一百九十七亿五千万元的打井、水车贷款；各地合作社供应了大量的打井器材；各级人民政府还派了一些打井和安装水车的技术人员下乡帮助农民。（新华社）
