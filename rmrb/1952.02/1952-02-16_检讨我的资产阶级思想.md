　　Self-Criticism of My Bourgeois Ideology
    Ma Dayou, President of the Engineering College of Peking University

　　At the beginning of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, my understanding was insufficient. I thought that corruption and waste had nothing to do with me, and although bureaucracy was unavoidable, it didn't seem serious. I fundamentally didn't recognize my own mistakes, nor did I appreciate the gravity of my responsibilities; especially, I didn't realize how much damage my bureaucracy had caused the people. Therefore, when the initial investigation of the Engineering College revealed these cases of corruption and waste, I made a self-"criticism" to the faculty, staff, and workers of the Engineering College and the entire school with a light tone and a bystander's attitude, blaming and ridiculing many people, finding many excuses, and only superficially putting a few hats on myself. This proves how little I cared about the people's property! The working people cherish the fruits of their labor created through hard work. If they heard about such serious corruption and waste, they would be extremely resentful, but I treated it with an extremely unserious and insincere attitude. This proves how distant my position is from the working people! My position prevented me from recognizing the importance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and also prevented me from appreciating the meaning of "leaders taking the lead and personally getting involved." I even had plans to temporarily leave the school when the movement started. Fortunately, President Ma Yinchu corrected my mistakes. This attitude of mine was bound to cause extreme dissatisfaction among the masses.

　　Previously, I had very incorrect views on criticism and self-criticism. I often used self-criticism as a weapon to resist others' criticism. For example, when two professors in the Department of Chemical Engineering had a dispute, I not only did not help them see the problem from a principled perspective and resolve their dispute to strengthen unity, but instead added my own emotions and prejudices, fueling the dispute and escalating it to the point where it almost became irreconcilable. Then, I, in the guise of a "peacemaker," invited all the teachers in the department together, taking all the blame on myself, but without any real intention of self-criticism, and therefore without fundamentally solving anything. My previous "self-criticisms" did not start from specific issues, but simply picked a few hats, compared them, and put them on. It was different when I criticized others. I often exaggerated facts to sensationalize them, without any intention of helping comrades or curing diseases to save people. So, I would usually not mention opinions, but give a big criticism at the general assembly, even using sarcastic tones to make the criticized person feel ashamed, in order to achieve self-expression. The effect was not considered. This kind of "glib, sarcastic" attitude of criticism is entirely the method of mutual attack in capitalist countries. Bringing it to the people's motherland is really an insult to the word "criticism." I actually treated my comrades with such an attitude, ridiculing and mocking them like enemies. This once again proves how lacking I am in the people's position and how strong my bourgeois consciousness is.

　　It has been three years since Liberation, so why do I still have this kind of performance and cannot progress faster? On the one hand, it is because I have individualistic heroism, only seeing the shortcomings of others and not seeing my own problems. I have no understanding of myself at all, so of course I cannot make self-criticism. On the other hand, and more importantly, I have not been studying seriously for the past three years. After Liberation, my study of policies, documents, current events, etc., seemed to be diligent, and therefore I seemed to be making progress. But in reality, I only treated Marxism-Leninism as dogma, without truly understanding its essence. I have never seriously examined my own thoughts with the theories I have learned, and made a thorough critique of my old thoughts and old ways of working. Therefore, for the past three years, my way of thinking has remained the same old way, only with a gorgeous coat on the outside, while the dirt and filth inside remain unchanged.

　　The situation in which I handled the Department of Architecture problem shows that my thinking has basically not changed in the past three years. Mr. Zhu Zhaoxue came to Peking University as the Director of the Department of Architecture in 1947, and I had opinions about him from the beginning. First of all, Mr. Zhu graduated from the Sino-French University and studied in Belgium. Neither of these qualifications impressed me. In my eyes, at least a PhD from the United States or Germany could be considered an expert. What does studying in Belgium count for? Therefore, I did not trust Mr. Zhu's academic level. What I could not tolerate was that Mr. Zhu had a very strong personality. He had his own methods and did not listen, which was directly opposed to my sense of arrogance. Because of factionalism and individual heroism, I could not reconcile with Mr. Zhu Zhaoxue. Therefore, I also had prejudices against the Department of Architecture. I could not see many of its advantages, but I tried to magnify some of its shortcomings. Because I had disagreements with Mr. Zhu, and even saw the Department of Architecture as a thorn in my side, before Liberation, I often said that the Department of Architecture did not need to belong to the Engineering College, because it had very little in common with the other departments of the Engineering College. After Liberation, I secretly reported to the higher authorities that the Department of Architecture was unsound. Therefore, before the summer vacation of 1949, the North China Higher Education Commission ordered it to stop enrollment. After the order arrived at the school, it was suppressed for several weeks and only announced after the senior students left the school and the junior students had also left for their internships, in order to reduce resistance to the implementation. When the teachers and students in the department heard the news of the suspension of enrollment, they immediately rioted, and the junior students also rushed back to the school from the internship site, demanding reconsideration. I did not care about this at all. I only relied on personal grudges and absolutely did not think about the issue of cultivating talents for national construction, and used "I can only execute the instructions of the higher authorities" as an excuse, without considering everyone's opinions. After the students spent a whole summer running around, the North China Higher Education Commission finally decided to invite Mr. Zhu back to the school to continue to be in charge. But at this time, several teachers had left the school and could not come back at all, and the vitality of the Department of Architecture has not been restored to this day. At that time, because it was past the enrollment period, when Mr. Zhu raised the issue of enrollment, I refused him on the grounds that Peking University never enrolls students for the second time. Now there are only three students in the third grade of the Department of Architecture (who were transferred from other departments). When the country needs a large number of civil engineering and construction talents, we use great efforts to train only three students a year, which is really letting down the country and the people. This is how I, relying on personal prejudices, stand high above, not considering the opinions of the masses, ignoring the interests of the people, and playing tricks, have caused irreparable losses to the country. But I did not learn a lesson from this incident and improve my understanding. Last summer, Mr. Zhu Zhaoxue stayed in Shanghai for a long time for personal matters. When he came back, I relapsed again. On the surface, I hoped that he would resign from his concurrent positions and return to the school to lead the department, or only take on courses, but subjectively, I still hoped that he would not come. When he really wanted to resign, I wrote a perfunctory letter, and when he continued to want to resign, I no longer tried to persuade him. Mr. Li Youshan (Professor and Director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering) suggested that he should and could be persuaded to stay at the school, but I did not pay attention to it, and told Vice President Tang Yongtong that it would be good to allow him to resign, so as not to hinder the work of adjusting the departments and faculties; I told the teachers and students in the department that the school was prepared to accept Mr. Zhu's resignation. This is how I used this despicable two-faced approach to achieve the purpose of expelling Mr. Zhu. Of course, even if I didn't do this, Mr. Zhu might still leave, but I shouldn't have used such vile means to squeeze him out. As the president of the college, even if he had made mistakes, I should have used criticism to educate him, but I adopted a non-comradely attitude towards him. This also shows that my thinking and style have basically not changed in the past three years.

　　When I consider problems, I lack the people's standpoint. In my work, I have a serious bureaucratic style. The main reason is that I have long been seriously eroded by the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie. I have always thought that I am a petty-bourgeois intellectual, but in fact, since the age of twenty-five, I have been mixing in the so-called "upper class" society, often in contact with the bourgeoisie. Since becoming the President of the Engineering College of Peking University in 1947, because the school lacked equipment, I used various improper methods to collect materials. For example, I bought machines and electrical materials from the puppet relief administration by delaying payments, and used the rapid devaluation of the puppet currency to buy a large amount of materials with a small amount of money. I borrowed a material testing machine from the puppet highway administration and later refused to return it under the pretext of it being in use; I took out motors, water pumps, diesel engines, etc., from the materials stored in the Engineering College at the Guanting Reservoir. Many of the equipment in the Engineering College was collected in this way through deception, reliance, and theft. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it was, of course, irrelevant whether it was right or wrong to collect experimental equipment for the school using these improper methods, but this practice of openly robbing and secretly seizing, speculating and taking advantage, is obviously a despicable means of accumulating funds by the bourgeoisie or even the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and a path guided by the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie. It is impossible not to leave a deep mark on one's own thinking after being accustomed to doing this. First of all, it increased my sense of arrogance, making me feel that my ability was higher than anyone else's, and therefore I looked down on everyone, standing high above and being detached from the masses. Secondly, it made me like to show off my cleverness and play tricks. Promoting work is often not about raising it to the level of principle to solve the ideological problems of comrades (I myself do not look at problems from the perspective of principle), but only treating it as a task to persuade them from the perspective of personal gain. This further strengthens the individualism and departmentalism of the comrades in the Engineering College. And sometimes it is impossible not to give comrades the impression of insincerity, making comrades suspect that I have ulterior motives. Because I lost vigilance against the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie, not only did I not feel pain and shame because I had adopted many despicable means in the past, but I was complacent about my great神通 (magical powers), isn't this a full expression of the toxins existing in my thinking? After Liberation, those open acts of theft were, of course, illegal, but for the materials that had already been obtained, although many of them could not be fully utilized in the school, I clung to them tightly with the selfish attitude of the bourgeoisie, using the excuse that they were not easy to obtain and would always be useful in the future, and refused to let other units use them. If this batch of backlog equipment were organized or used in appropriate places, it could create a large amount of wealth for the people, and it would also play a certain role in the country's industrialization. But I let these valuable assets lie idle, rusting and breaking down, causing serious losses. This attitude of not knowing how to cherish the people's property is simply an intolerable crime. The people entrusted me with such a major task as the Engineering College, but I have always allowed the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie to dominate me, wasting a large amount of the people's wealth, and still thought that there was no problem. This is an unforgivable mistake.

　　The toxins of the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie in my thinking are serious. Because I have been unwilling to seriously study in connection with my own thinking, I have never recognized my own dirty and filthy thoughts and actions. On the contrary, I arrogantly thought that I was a self-respecting petty-bourgeois intellectual, and under this mask, I did many shameful things. After Liberation, I have been using the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie to lead the work of the Engineering College of Peking University, occupying important positions and harming the people. In terms of talent cultivation and material utilization, I have caused a large amount of waste to the country and caused irreparable losses to the people. In the future, I can only work harder and serve the people wholeheartedly to atone for my sins. I deeply thank Chairman Mao's wise and correct leadership, which timely proposed the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, giving me the opportunity to conduct a deep introspection and liquidate my bourgeois ideology, so as not to bring greater disasters to the people. I also want to thank my comrades for their sincere and patient help, which made me realize my own mistakes. I have full courage and confidence to intensify my study and transform my thinking, so that I can become a people's teacher urgently needed for national construction, and strive to cultivate a large number of people's cadres with both virtue and talent, sound physique, and a high level of communist consciousness.

### 检讨我的资产阶级思想

　　检讨我的资产阶级思想
    北京大学工学院院长  马大猷
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始的时候，我的认识是不够的。以为贪污和浪费和自己没有关系，官僚主义虽然难免，但也似乎并不严重。我根本没有认识到自己的错误，也没有体会到自己所负的责任的重大；尤其是没有认识到由于自己的官僚主义，曾给人民招致了多大的损害。因此，当工学院的初步检查发现这些贪污浪费情况时，我还以轻松的口气和旁观者的态度向工学院和全校的教、职、员、工同志们作自我“检讨”，并责备嘲笑了很多人，找到不少借口，只给自己戴上几顶帽子，敷衍了事。这可证明我对人民财产是如何的不关心！劳动人民对于自己辛辛苦苦创造出来的劳动果实是非常爱惜的，如果听到了这种严重的贪污浪费行为一定要愤恨万分，而我却用极不严肃、极不诚恳的态度来对待，这可证明我的立场和劳动人民有多大距离！我的立场使我不能认识反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重要性，也使我不能体会到“首长带头，亲自动手”的意义，甚至在运动开始时，我还有暂时离校的计划。幸亏马寅初校长纠正了我的错误。我这种态度当然要引起群众的极端不满。
    以前我对于批评和自我批评有很不正确的看法。我常把自我批评当做抵制别人批评的武器。例如当化学工程系两位教授发生争执的时候，我不但没有帮助他们从原则上去看问题，解决他们的争端，以加强彼此间的团结，反而把自己的感情和成见加入，推波助澜地把争执更扩大了，到后来闹得几乎不可开交，我这才以“和事佬”的姿态，约请系中全体教师到一起，把一切错误都揽在自己身上，但并没有真正检讨的意思，因此也没有从根本上解决什么问题。我以前做的“自我批评”都不是从具体问题出发的，只是拣几顶帽子，比比差不多就戴上了事。我批评别人时就不同了，常常是夸大事实以耸人听闻，丝毫没有帮助同志，治病救人的意思。所以有意见是平常不提，在大会上大批评一番，甚至于用尖酸刻薄的口气使受批评者无地自容，以达到自我表现的目的，效果是在所不计的。这种“油腔滑调，尖酸刻薄”的批评态度，完全是资本主义国家中互相攻讦的办法，把它带到人民祖国来，实在是污辱了“批评”这两个字。我竟用这样的态度对待自己的同志，把他们象敌人一般来嘲笑奚落，这再度证明我是如何缺乏人民立场，资产阶级的意识是如何的浓厚。
    解放已三年，我为什么还有这种表现，而不能更快的进步呢？一方面是因为我有个人英雄主义思想，只看见别人的缺点，看不见自己的毛病，自己对自己根本不认识，当然无法检讨了。另一方面，也是更重要的是三年来一直没有认真学习。解放后，我对于政策、文件、时事等的学习好像是努力的，因而表现得也还进步。但实际上我只是把马克思列宁主义当做教条，没有真正体会它的实质，从来也没有用学得的理论，认真地检查自己的思想，把旧思想、旧作风作一彻底批判。所以三年来，我的思想方法仍是老一套，只是在外面披上了华丽的外套，里面的肮脏污浊却是原封不动。
    从我处理建筑系问题的情况，就可以看出我的思想三年来是基本上没有改变的。朱兆雪先生于一九四七年到北京大学作建筑系主任，我从开始时就对他有意见。首先，朱先生是中法大学毕业，比利时留学，这两重资格都不能引起我的重视。在我的眼光中，至少是美国或者是德国的博士才能算是专家，比利时留学的算什么呢？因此对于朱先生的学术水平是不信任的。尤其使我不能容忍的是朱先生个性非常强，他有他的办法，不听话，这和我的自高自大意识正好针锋相对。因为宗派主义和个人英雄主义的关系，就使我和朱兆雪先生无法调和了。因而我也对建筑系有了成见。建筑系有很多优点，我都看不见，而它的某些缺点我却尽量加以扩大。因为和朱先生闹意见，并进而把建筑系看成眼中钉，在解放前，我就经常说建筑系没有必要属于工学院，因为它和工学院其他各系共同的地方很少。解放后，我还暗中向上级反映，说建筑系如何不健全，因此在一九四九年暑假前，当时华北高等教育委员会就令其停止招生。当命令到达学校以后，又压置了几个星期，等四年级同学离校，三年级同学也出发实习后才发表，以减少执行的阻力。系中师生听到停止招生消息后，立刻大哗，三年级同学也从实习工地赶回学校，要求重新考虑，我对此一点也没有管，我只凭个人恩怨，绝对没有想到国家建设人才的培养问题，并用“我只能执行上级指示”为辞，毫不考虑大家的意见。经同学多方奔走，费了一个暑假的时间，最后才由华北高等教育委员会决定，请朱先生回校继续负责。但这时已经有几位先生离校，根本不能回来了，建筑系的元气至今还没有恢复。那时因已过了招生时期，朱先生提出招生问题时，我以北京大学向来不招第二次生为辞又拒绝了他。现在建筑系三年级只有三个同学（还是由他系转来的）。在国家建设中需要大批土木建筑人材时，我们用很大力量一年只培养三个同学，真是对不起国家，对不起人民。我就是这样，凭个人成见，高高在上，不考虑群众意见，不顾人民的利益，玩弄手段，使国家受到了不可补偿的损失的。但是我并没有从这次事件取得教训，提高自己的认识。去年暑假朱兆雪先生为私事逗留上海多时，在他回来时，我又故态复萌，表面是希望他辞去兼差回校领导系务，或是只担任课程，但主观上却还是希望他不来。他果然要辞职，我就写信敷衍了一下，他仍继续要辞职时，我就不再劝了。李酉山先生（机械工程学系教授兼系主任）提出应该并且也可能争取他留校，但我不加重视，并且向汤用彤副校长讲，允许他辞职也好，以免他妨碍院系调整工作；对系中先生和同学则说学校已准备接受朱先生的辞职。我就是用这种可耻的两面派的办法来达到驱逐朱先生的目的的。当然，我不这样做，朱先生也许还是要走，但是我不应当用这种恶劣手段来排挤他，我身为院长，就是他有错误，也应该用批评的方法对他进行教育，但我对他所采取的是非同志的态度。这也可以看出，在三年中我的思想和作风是基本没有改变的。
    我在考虑问题时，缺乏人民立场，在工作中，有严重的官僚主义作风。主要的原因是我早已受了资产阶级腐朽思想的严重侵蚀。我一直以为自己是小资产阶级知识分子，事实上自二十五岁起我就是在所谓“上层”社会中混，经常接触资产阶级。自一九四七年做北京大学工学院院长后，因为学校缺少设备，就用种种不正当的方法搜集物资。比如用拖账方式向伪救济总署购买机器和电料，利用伪法币的迅速贬值，用少数钱购得大批物资。向伪公路总局借来材料试验机，后来借口不还；自官厅水库在工学院存贮物资内取出电动机、水泵、柴油机等。工学院的设备很多就是这样用骗、赖、偷的方法搜集来的。在国民党反动统治下，用这些不正当的方法为学校搜集实验设备，当然无所谓对不对，可是这种明抢暗夺、投机取巧的作法，显然的是资产阶级甚至是官僚资产阶级积累资金的卑鄙手段，是资产阶级腐朽思想所指导的道路。这样做得惯了而不在自己的思想上留下深刻的烙印是不可能的。首先，它增加了我的自高自大感，觉得自己的能力比任何人都高，因而看不起任何人，高高在上，脱离群众。其次，它使我喜欢卖弄聪明，耍手腕。推动工作常常不是提高到原则上来解决同志们的思想问题（我自己也不从原则上看问题），只是当作一件任务从个人的利害出发加以说服。这样更加强了工学院中同志们的个人主义和本位主义思想。并且有时就不能不给同志们以不诚恳的印象，使同志们怀疑我别有用心。我因为对资产阶级腐朽思想失去警惕，不仅不因为过去采取了很多的卑鄙手段，觉得痛心，觉得羞耻；反而自觉神通广大而沾沾自喜，这不是充分表现了我思想中所存在的毒素么？在解放后，那些公开的盗窃行为当然是非法的了，但是对于已到手的物资虽然不少是学校中无法充分利用的，可是我却以得来不易，将来总会有用为借口，用资产阶级自私自利的态度紧紧的守着，不肯让给其他单位使用。这批积压的设备如果组织起来或者使用在适当的地方，是可以为人民创造大量财富的，并且也要在国家工业化中起一定的作用。但我却让这些宝贵的财富白白地闲置着，生锈、坏毁，造成严重的损失。这所表现的对人民财产不知爱惜的态度简直是不能令人容忍的罪过。人民把工学院这样一个重大的任务交给我，我却一直让资产阶级腐朽思想支配着我，把大批人民财富浪费着，自己还以为没有什么问题，这是不可饶恕的错误。
    我思想中所存在的资产阶级腐朽思想的毒素是严重的。由于不肯认真联系自己思想进行学习，对于自己的污浊肮脏思想行为一直没有认识。并且相反地，我还自高自大地认为自己是洁身自好的小资产阶级知识分子，并且在这假面具下做了不少可耻的事。解放后，我还是一直用资产阶级的腐朽思想领导着北京大学工学院的工作，窃据要津，贻害人民，在人材培养上，在物资利用上都给国家造成了大量的浪费，使人民蒙受不可补偿的损失。以后只有倍加努力，全心全意地为人民服务，才能稍赎我的罪过。我深深地感谢毛主席英明正确的领导，及时地提出反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，使我有机会进行深刻的反省，清算自己的资产阶级思想，以免带给人民更大的灾害。我也要感谢同志们对我的诚挚和耐心的帮助，使我认清了自己的错误。我有充分的勇气和信心，加紧学习，改造自己的思想，使自己成为祖国建设所迫切需要的人民教师，为培养大批德才兼备，体魄健全、具有高度共产主义觉悟水平的人民干部而奋斗。
