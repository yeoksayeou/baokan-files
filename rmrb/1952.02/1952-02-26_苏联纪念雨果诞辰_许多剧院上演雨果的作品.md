Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd: The Soviet people are universally commemorating the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great French writer Victor Hugo. Many cities and villages are holding commemorative literary evenings, scientific conferences, and lectures. In Moscow, Dr. Ivashchenko of Soviet Linguistics, gave a public lecture on the 22nd entitled "Hugo's Life and Works."

    He said: The Soviet people, together with progressive humanity around the world, remember the passionate humanist Hugo. The name of this great son of the French people, a friend of all the oppressed and injured, is closely related to the strongest and most universal movement of our time - the movement to defend peace. Hugo's works occupy a prominent place in the history of French social thought and culture. After the lecture, a literary program was performed, with actors from Moscow theaters performing Hugo's works. The Moscow Central Journalists Club also held a literary evening on the same day.

    In Leningrad, Ms. Khatisova, Master of Soviet Linguistics, delivered a speech at the Scientists' Club, discussing Hugo's position in 19th-century progressive literature. She said: When the World Peace Council called on people around the world to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Hugo's birth, it emphasized the significance of this great French writer's works in today's struggle for peace and democracy by all progressive humanity. Hugo's entire creative path is the path of a great warrior; in his dramas, poems, novels, essays, and speeches, he tirelessly advocated for the liberation of the oppressed and injured. It is precisely for this reason that progressive humanity around the world especially cherishes Hugo's works.
