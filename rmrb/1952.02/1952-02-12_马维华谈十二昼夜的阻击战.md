    Ma Weihua Talks About the Twelve Days and Nights of Blocking War

    I am a political instructor of a certain battalion of the Volunteer Army. During the enemy's so-called "Autumn Offensive" last year, I was the political instructor of the Eighth Company. Our company once defended a certain high ground in Korea. After twelve days and nights, we repelled more than thirty consecutive enemy attacks, killed and wounded more than 650 enemies. The entire company received a first-class merit, and I also gloriously received a first-class merit for the second time.

    On September 20th, we saw the enemy move a company behind our position, and at the same time moved their automatic weapons from the front left to the rear right, forming a semi-circle, aimed at our position. We estimated that the enemy would launch a major attack tomorrow. The company commander and I immediately divided the work. The company commander personally observed the terrain in detail, studied the enemy's strength and possible directions and roads of attack, and deployed our own troops and firepower. I was responsible for organizing the second squad to dig fortifications overnight to deal with the enemy on the front right.

    At dawn on the 21st, the enemy's six chemical mortar groups began to bombard our position continuously. Then, eight enemy planes frantically strafed, bombed, and dropped gasoline canisters over our heads in turn. At this time, the enemy, with a battalion of troops, launched an attack on us from the front in three routes. The enemy occupied our forward position at the cost of more than a hundred people, directly threatening our company command post. At the same time, more than sixty enemy tanks, eighteen of which had penetrated behind our position, cut off our rear's reinforcement of troops and ammunition. The enemy's recoilless guns, set up on the top of the high mountain, bombarded our position, while the tank artillery fiercely bombarded the rear of our position. Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy infantry attacked us from six routes. The situation was very critical. I called on everyone: "We must resolutely defend the position and wipe out the enemy on the front line of the position. The heroes of the Chinese nation must not lose face for Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland." I then organized eighteen people in the company, including the bugler and barber, to stop the enemy's charge. Accompanied by the sound of gongs and drums, the enemy climbed up like a flock of sheep. When they climbed to twenty meters away from our position, squad leader Tao Tongshan shouted: "The time for revenge has come!" A string of grenades bloomed like hailstones in the enemy. The cowardly enemy rolled and crawled down. Comrade Tao Tongshan then jumped out of the fortifications, and Wang Jinshui also jumped out, and gave the enemy several grenades in a row. The enemy dared not charge any more. At this time, we saw an enemy commander waving a red flag to order his soldiers to continue the attack. Meng Jinshuan, who had already killed more than a dozen enemies, was furious. He raised his submachine gun and shot through the guy's arm with one bullet, throwing the little red flag far away, and then rolled down. On this day, we fought fiercely for thirteen consecutive hours, defeated the enemy's fourteen charges, and finally repelled the enemy. (Picture attached)

    马维华谈十二昼夜的阻击战
    我是志愿军某营的教导员。在去年敌军发动所谓“秋季攻势”时，我是第八连的政治指导员，我们连曾据守在朝鲜某高地，经过十二昼夜，击退了敌人三十余次连续进攻，毙伤敌人六百五十余名，全连立了一等功，我也第二次光荣地立了一级功。
    九月二十日，我们看到敌人在我阵地的后面调来了一个连，同时把他们的自动火器也从左前方移到右后方，摆了个半圆形，对准了我们的阵地。我们估计敌人明天一定会来一次大的攻击。我和连长马上分了工。连长亲自详细地观察了地形，研究了敌人的兵力和可能来的方向和道路，又配置好了我们自己的兵力和火力。我则负责组织二班连夜挖起了对付右前方敌人的工事。
    二十一日拂晓，敌人的六个化学迫击炮群开始连续向我阵地猛击，接着八架敌机又在我们的上空疯狂地轮番扫射、轰炸和扔汽油筒。这时敌人以一个营的兵力分三路从正面向我们冲锋，敌人以一百多人的代价占领了我前沿阵地，直接威胁我连指挥所。同时敌人的六十多辆坦克，已有十八辆插到我方阵地的后面，切断了我们后方的兵力和弹药的支援。前边敌人的无座力炮，架在高山顶上向我阵地轰击，坦克上的炮火则猛轰我阵地的后面。在炮火的掩护下，敌人步兵分六路向我夹击。这时的情势已很危急，我便向大家号召：“要坚决守住阵地，把敌人消灭在阵地前沿，中华民族的英雄们决不能给毛主席和祖国人民丢脸。”我又随即组织了连里的司号员、理发员等十八个人，阻住敌人的冲锋。敌人在铜鼓洋号的助威下，像羊群似的爬上来了。在爬到离我们阵地二十米时，班长陶同山即高喊：“报仇的时候到了！”一串手榴弹就像冰雹似的在敌人中间开了花，怕死的敌人连滚带爬的下去了。陶同山同志接着跳出了工事，王金水也跟着跳出来，又一连给敌人吃了几个手榴弹。敌人再也不敢冲了。这时我们看到敌人的一个指挥官摇着红旗要它的士兵们继续冲锋。已经打死了十几个敌人的孟金拴气坏了，他端起冲锋枪一发子弹就打穿了那个家伙的胳膊，把小红旗扔了好远，接着就滚了下去。这一天我们连续进行了十三个小时的激烈战斗，打败了敌人的十四次冲锋，最后终于击退了敌人。（附图片）
