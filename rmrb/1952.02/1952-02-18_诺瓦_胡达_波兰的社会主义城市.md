    Nowa Huta - Poland's Socialist City
    In Poland, a completely new city will soon appear. This city is Nowa Huta, which in Polish means: new steel mill.
    In the spring of 1950, the Polish people heard an inspiring message: in order to complete the Six-Year National Economic Plan, to rapidly put the country on the road to industrialization, and to rapidly increase steel production, the Polish government decided to build a large-scale steel mill in the fields near Krakow. Its steel production will be equal to the total output of the twenty steel mills in Poland before the Second World War. For the needs of steelworkers and their families, the government also decided to build a new type of city that can accommodate 100,000 people at the same time.
    Two years ago, this was still a field of crops, and now, the prototype of a city has emerged here. Hundreds of houses and many workers' residences have been built, replacing the sparse farmhouses of the past. Apart from Warsaw, this is already the largest construction site in Poland.
    In order to build Nowa Huta, the transportation lines near Krakow are undergoing thorough renovation in order to transport raw materials and finished products to and from Nowa Huta. The course of the Vistula River will be changed, and a new transportation network of modern docks, railways, and motor roads will be established in this industrial center. Now, people can already see that thousands upon thousands of cars, dredgers, and various construction machines are working on this huge construction site.
    In the future, there will not only be well-equipped workers' residences here, but also various facilities that can fully meet the needs of workers and residents in terms of material, cultural, and social welfare. There will be a commercial network here that serves workers and their families entirely, including small shops, large-scale department stores, shoe stores, clothing stores, and barbershops, as well as a shopping mall. This shopping mall supplies machine-made bread and has machine laundry facilities.
    There will be forty nurseries, forty kindergartens, twenty primary schools, seven middle schools, and eight specialized schools. In terms of cultural entertainment, there will be forty reading rooms, nine social rooms, cultural centers, youth centers, and four cinemas distributed in various residential areas. The entire residential area also has health center stations, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care facilities.
    Five years later, the countless huge chimneys of Nowa Huta's large steel mill will emit thick smoke for the first time, and boiling steel will be poured out of the steelmaking furnaces in large quantities, turning into machines, steel rails, tools, sent to factories, and transported to the countryside...

    诺瓦·胡达——波兰的社会主义城市
    在波兰，不久将要出现一个完全新的城市。这个城市就是诺瓦·胡达，它的波兰文的意思是：新的冶炼厂。
    一九五○年的春天，波兰人民听到一个振奋人心的消息：为了完成六年国民经济计划，使国家迅速走上工业化的道路，为了迅速地增加钢铁的产量，波兰政府决定在克拉科附近的田野上，建筑一个规模巨大的冶炼厂，它的钢产量，将等于第二次世界大战以前波兰全国二十个炼钢厂的总产量。为了炼钢工人和他们的家属的需要，政府并决定同时在那里建设一个可以容纳十万人口的新型城市。
    两年以前，这里还是一片庄稼地，现在，这里已经出现了一个城市的雏型。好几百幢房屋和许多工人住宅已经建立起来，代替了以前的疏疏落落的农舍。除了华沙以外，这里已是波兰最大的建筑现场了。
    为了建设诺瓦·胡达，克拉科附近的交通线正在进行彻底改造，以便给诺瓦·胡达运入原料和运出成品。维斯杜拉河的河水将要改道，新的具有现代化设备的码头、铁路和汽车路的运输网，将要在这一工业中心地区建立起来。现在，人们已经可以看到：成千成万的汽车、掘泥机和各种建筑机器，正在这个巨大的工程现场上工作着。
    将来，这里不但有设备完善的工人住宅，并且还有能够充分满足工人和居民在物质、文化和社会福利方面需要的各种设施。这里将要有一个完全为工人及其家属服务的商业网，其中有小型的商店，有规模宏大的百货公司，有鞋店、成衣铺和理发店，还有一个商场。这个商场供应机制面包，并且有机器洗衣的设备。
    这里将有四十个托儿所，四十个幼稚园，二十个小学，七个中学和八个专科学校。在文化娱乐方面，这里将有分布在各住宅区内的四十个阅览室，九个交谊室、文化馆、青年馆与四个电影院。整个住宅区并有健康中心站、医院、药房等卫生保健设施。
    五年以后，诺瓦·胡达的大冶炼厂的无数巨大的烟囱将要第一次吐出浓烟，沸腾的钢水将要从炼钢炉里大量倾泻出来，变成机器、钢轨、工具，送进工厂，运往农村……。（附图片）
