    Suggest the People's Government convene a mass rally to publicly try major profiteers

    Comrade Editor: On February 1st, I listened to the live broadcast recording of the public trial of major embezzlers in Beijing. During the less than three hours of the meeting, I deeply realized that the policy of combining leniency with punishment in the People's Government's anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is so correct and great. The purpose of this movement is to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on us over the past three years. The People's Government has made great efforts to save those who have fallen or been dragged into the water, and to educate and reform all those who can be educated and reformed. This is evidenced by the government's repeated extension of the confession deadline. Even for major embezzlers like Xia Maoru, because he sincerely repented, thoroughly confessed himself, and exposed other lawbreakers, the People's Government released him. This made us feel that the government is truly extremely lenient.

    The People's Government later gave all those who had not confessed another fifteen days to confess. It can be said that the People's Government has done everything humanly possible. Now that the fifteen-day deadline is approaching, the fate of the corrupt elements and major profiteers depends on their own performance. Those who do not confess will be severely punished.

    I suggest that the People's Government promptly convene another mass rally to publicly try major profiteers, to appease public anger. At the same time, educate those profiteers who are still stubbornly clinging to their mistakes, so that they can quickly embark on the path of confession and self-renewal.

    建议人民政府召开群众大会公审大奸商
    编辑同志：二月一日我听到了北京市公审大贪污犯的实况广播录音。在为时不到三个小时的大会中，我深深体会到人民政府在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中的宽大和惩办相结合的政策，是这样的正确和伟大。这一运动的目的是打退资产阶级三年来向我们的猖狂进攻。人民政府为挽救那些堕落失足或被拉下水的人们，教育、改造一切可能教育改造的人们，作了很大的努力。这一点从政府一再地延展坦白截止日期来看，就是明证。对夏茂如那样大的贪污犯，由于他真诚悔改，自己彻底坦白，并且检举了别的违法分子，人民政府都把他释放了。这使我们感觉到政府真是再宽大不过了。
    人民政府以后又给了一切没有坦白的人以十五天的坦白机会。人民政府可说已作到了仁至义尽。现在十五天期限又快到了，贪污分子、大奸商们的命运，就看他们自己的表现了。不坦白的将会受到严厉惩办。
    我建议人民政府迅速再开一次公审大奸商的群众大会，以平民愤。同时教育那些至今还执迷不悟的奸商们，使他们赶快走向坦白自新的道路。
