    An Initiative to Tap New Potential for 1952 Production
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent Li He
    Numerous Soviet laborers completed their production plans ahead of schedule in the socialist competition and bid farewell to 1951. Thanks to the improvement of production equipment, the increase in the political and technical level of those using this equipment, and the improvement of leadership in production competitions, the Soviet Union's "current competition has been raised to a new and higher level" (Pravda). Now, participants in the socialist competition in the Soviet Union are no longer satisfied with merely overfulfilling production tasks; they are striving for greater achievements in all aspects of production indicators. Therefore, movements such as reducing product costs in every operation, completing every production operation excellently, and comprehensively summarizing and promoting Stakhanovite experience have recently emerged. A comprehensive competition to increase labor productivity, better use technical equipment, improve quality and reduce costs, and save more raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity has been particularly widely carried out. Under various socialist competition movements, the laborers of Moscow City and Moscow Oblast completed their annual production plan on December 14, 1951, and forty-four factories became collective Stakhanovite enterprises and enterprises producing high-quality products.

    However, for the Soviet people, there is no unsurpassable highest level, no limit that hinders progress. Soviet laborers are marching towards 1952 with a new spirit of enterprise. This has led to the moving new movement of "tapping new potential to victoriously complete the 1952 plan."

    The initiators of the new movement are the famous initiators of the raw material saving movement, Stalin Prize winners Rozhneva (who visited China with the Soviet youth delegation in 1950) and Kononenko. They are both young female workers at the Kubavino Factory in Moscow Oblast. The Kubavino Factory is an excellent fine woolen textile factory: in 1951, its first-class products accounted for 99.28 percent of all products, and it saved 6 million rubles in eleven months by reducing product costs. At the general meeting of the factory on December 18, 1951, to discuss the 1952 production plan, Rozhneva spoke. She pointed out that the factory had done a lot in using equipment well, saving raw materials, improving quality, and reducing costs, but not all potential had been exhausted. She used convincing experience to illustrate: when the saving movement was initiated in 1949, some people worried that it could not be done; but in two and a half years, an extra 290,000 meters of cloth were produced solely through savings. When the movement to produce only high-quality products began, some people also doubted it; but now there are hundreds of high-quality groups in the factory, and the factory maintains the honor of "an enterprise with high quality and high productivity." In the past, first-class products were only 70 to 80 percent, but now they have reached 99.28 percent. She said that the 1952 production plan is tight, and we should rely on the experience of advanced workers and tap new potential to ensure the overfulfillment of the state-stipulated plan for 1952. Where is the potential? She said: "The main potential lies in raising the laggards to the level of the advanced more quickly." She gave some examples: the average amount of waste wool in the workshop is 1.45 percent, and the average spinning rate is 375.8 kilograms per 1,000 spindles per hour (Note: This is calculated according to the metric system). The percentage of waste wool in many production groups is lower, saving a lot of raw materials, and they only produce first-class products; but the waste wool in some production groups reaches 2.08 percent or 1.96 percent, and the spinning rate is only 356.9 kilograms per 1,000 spindles per hour or 349.5 kilograms per 1,000 spindles per hour. She encouraged everyone at the meeting: "If these production groups all reach the workshop's average standard, what will be the result! As for reaching the advanced standards, it goes without saying."

    Rozhneva proposed the following tasks at the meeting that her production group guaranteed to complete in 1952: (1) Increase the productivity of the machines to 400 kilograms of yarn per 1,000 spindles per hour (the plan stipulates 377 kilograms); (2) Reduce waste wool to 1 percent (the plan stipulates 3 percent); (3) Only spin first-class yarn; (4) Reduce costs by more than 800 rubles per month; (5) Help two spinning groups achieve the same achievements in 1952. Kononenko's group made similar guarantees and will help three weavers achieve the same achievements. They called on all workers to explore and use new potential to "complete the 1952 plan ahead of schedule and create new production achievements for the motherland."

    The entire production meeting of the Kubavino Factory unanimously supported the proposals of Rozhneva and Kononenko. According to the decision of this meeting, economic statisticians and trade union staff explained the main content of the 1952 production plan to each worker. Dozens of production meetings were held in various workshops, production groups, and production sections to tap production potential. Advanced workers and technicians put forward 461 suggestions in eight days, including increasing machine speed, improving technical processes, reducing material consumption, and increasing first-class products.

    For example, female workers Kidyushina and two others looked after 800 spindles, doing the work of four people, and overproducing high-quality products. It seemed that they had done their best. But in response to Rozhneva's call, they continued to explore potential. Finally, they found that when changing spools without stopping the machine, there was always a little bit of roving (roving before spinning into yarn) left on the spool, amounting to several kilograms per day. If these were saved, the waste wool could be reduced by three-fifths compared to the plan. In addition, they decided to increase the productivity of the machines to 400 kilograms of yarn per 1,000 spindles per hour, and only produce first-class cloth.

    The factory trade union committee collected all the suggestions and the conditions guaranteed by each participant in the competition and turned them into a plan. This plan was discussed and approved by the general meeting of the factory on December 28, 1951, and became the covenant of the factory's socialist competition in 1952. Its content is: (1) To produce an extra 6 tons of yarn, 12,000 meters of unprocessed fabric, and 20,000 meters of cloth in 1952 by saving raw materials and semi-finished products; (2) To produce 95 percent first-class yarn according to various categories (the state-stipulated plan is 92.8 percent), 99 percent first-class fabrics (the plan is 93.7 percent), and 99.5 percent first-class cloth (the plan is 99.3 percent); (3) To reduce product costs by 800,000 rubles beyond the plan; (4) To increase machine productivity: spinning machines by 1 percent beyond the plan, and weaving machines by 2.3 percent beyond the plan; (5) To increase labor productivity: spinning by 2 percent beyond the plan, weaving by 3 percent beyond the plan, and cleaning by 5 percent beyond the plan; (6) To reduce equipment downtime by better using and better repairing the equipment: instruments by 0.5 percent beyond the plan, spinning machines by 0.5 percent beyond the plan, and weaving machines by 0.6 percent beyond the plan; (7) In terms of technical equipment repair: the number of machines and lathes repaired excellently will reach 75 percent, and the cost of repair work and construction work will be reduced by 5 percent beyond the plan; (8) To save 75,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 2 percent of fuel beyond the plan; (9) To implement a situation registration system in spinning and weaving production; (10) To increase the day and night mileage of factory vehicles by reducing downtime, and to improve the quality of vehicle repair and supply by 10 percent; (11) To recruit 150 people to study in production technology training classes, 200 people to study in Stakhanovite worker schools, and 200 people to study in designated training classes; (12) To guarantee the completion of the three-year plan to train 1,100 employees; (13) To complete the residential building plan ahead of schedule; (14) To challenge all the staff of the Moscow Telman Factory to a socialist competition.

    This competition covenant concentrates on the advanced experience, wisdom, and determination of all the staff of the Kubavino Factory. The example of the Kubavino Factory shows how the workers' initiatives are being rapidly realized in an organized way in Soviet factories.

    After the proposals of Rozhneva and Kononenko were put forward, the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry and the Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Union immediately approved them and recommended them to all textile factories and light industrial factories. Soviet Deputy Minister of Light Industry Sporyshev said in a speech: "The initiative of the textile workers of the Kubavino Factory has great national economic significance. Its value lies in attracting all the staff to explore production potential." "The work should be organized in such a way that every worker knows what tasks are in front of him and what indicators he should reach. This will allow workers to fully exert their creativity and encourage more workers to put forward suggestions, improving everyone's sense of responsibility for the collective's achievements. When organizing this work, economic leaders should pay close attention to the opinions and suggestions put forward by the workers at the production meetings discussing the 1952 plan. Every valuable suggestion should be implemented quickly and without obstruction. Tapping new potential is a major and meticulous task. It should be carried out in an organized way with the active participation of all the staff." The initiative of "tapping new potential to victoriously complete the 1952 plan" has been responded to by the Moscow textile enterprises, light industrial enterprises, and the Rostov "Red Aksai" machine manufacturing plant. Labor Daily published two editorials on this issue in ten days, pointing out that this initiative can also be applied to all enterprises in heavy industry and transportation.

    为一九五二年生产发掘新潜在力量的创举
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    苏联众多劳动者在社会主义竞赛中提前完成了生产计划，送走了一九五一年。由于生产装备的完善、使用这些装备的人们的政治和技术水平的提高、生产竞赛领导的改进，苏联“现在的竞赛已经提到新的更高的水平”（真理报）。现在苏联参加社会主义竞赛者已经不以超额完成生产任务为满足，他们都努力在生产标志的各方面争取更大的成就，所以最近产生了在每一个操作上减低产品成本、优等地完成每一个生产操作、全面总结和推广斯塔哈诺夫经验等等运动；关于提高劳动生产率，更好使用技术装备，提高质量和减低成本，更多节约原料、材料、燃料、电力的全面竞赛都特别广泛地开展着。在各种社会主义竞赛运动下，莫斯科市和莫斯科州的劳动者们在一九五一年十二月十四日就完成了全年生产计划，四十四个工厂成了集体斯塔哈诺夫式的企业和生产优等质量产品的企业。
    然而对于苏联人说来，没有什么不可超越的最高水平，没有什么阻碍前进的界限。苏联劳动者以新的进取精神走向一九五二年。这样就产生了“为胜利完成一九五二年计划发掘新潜在力量”的动人的新运动。
    新运动的发起人就是著名的节约原料运动发起人、斯大林奖金获得者罗日聂娃（一九五○年曾参加苏联青年代表团访问过我国）和柯诺年科。她们都是莫斯科州库巴维因工厂的年青女工。库巴维因厂是一个出色的细呢纺织厂：它一九五一年出产的头等产品占全部产品百分之九九点二八，十一个月中由于减低产品成本节约了六百万卢布。在一九五一年十二月十八日工厂全体人员讨论一九五二年生产计划的大会上，罗日聂娃说话了。她指出工厂在很好地使用装备、节约原料、提高质量和减低成本上做了很多事情，但并不是一切潜在力量都用尽了。她以令人信服的经验说明：当一九四九年才发起节约运动时，有人顾虑做不到；可是两年半中，仅仅由于节约就额外多生产了二十九万公尺布。当开始推行只出产优等质量产品运动时，也有人怀疑；但是现在全厂有几百个优等质量组，全厂保持着“优等质量和高度生产率的企业”的荣誉，以前头等产品不过百分之七八十，而现在达到百分之九九点二八。她说，一九五二年生产计划是紧张的，应当依靠先进工人的经验，发掘新的潜在力来保证超计划地完成一九五二年国家规定的计划。潜在力量在那里呢？她说：“主要的潜在力量在于要更迅速地提高落后者到先进者的水平。”她举出一些例子：车间的屑毛平均为百分之一点四五，一千纱锭一小时平均纺纱三百七十五点八千克支（按：这是按万国公制计算的）。许多生产组的屑毛百分数要小，节约很多原料，并且只出头等产品；但是有的生产组屑毛达百分之二点○八或一点九六，一千纱锭一小时不过纺纱三百五十六点九千克支或三百四十九点五千克支。她鼓励大会全体人员说：“如果这些生产组都达到车间的平均标准，那将会得到什么样的结果呵！至于达到先进者标准，那更不用说了。”
    罗日聂娃在大会提出自己那一生产组保证在一九五二年完成的任务如下：（一）提高机器的生产率到一千纱锭一小时纺纱四百千克支（计划规定三七七千克支）；（二）使屑毛减低到百分之一（计划规定百分之三）；（三）只纺头等纱；（四）一个月减低成本八百卢布以上；（五）帮助两个纺工组在一九五二年取得同样的成就。柯诺年科那一组提出类似的保证，将帮助三个织工取得同样的成就。她们号召全体工人发掘和使用新的潜在力量，来“提前完成一九五二年计划，给祖国创造新的生产成绩”。
    库巴维因工厂全体生产会议一致支持罗日聂娃和柯诺年科的建议。根据这次会议的决定，经济统计人员和工会工作人员向每个工人解释了一九五二年生产计划的主要内容。在各车间、生产组、生产段举行了几十个生产会议，来发掘生产潜在力量。先进的工人和技术人员在八天中就提出了四百六十一个建议，包括提高机器速度、改进技术过程、缩减材料消耗、增加头等产品等等。
    例如：女工基杜希娜等三人看管八百个纱锭，做着四个人的工作，并超额出产优等产品，似乎尽善尽美了。但她们响应罗日聂娃的号召，继续发掘潜在力量。终于她们发现在不断工的情况下换线轴时总有一点绒条（纺成纱前的绒条）留在线轴上，每天有几公斤之多。如把这些节约下来，屑毛就可能比计划减少五分之三。此外，她们决定提高机器的生产率到一小时一千纱锭纺纱四百千克支，并且只产头等布。
    工厂工会委员会收集了所有的建议和各个参加竞赛者保证的条件，订成方案。这个方案在一九五一年十二月二十八日，经工厂全体人员大会讨论和通过，成为一九五二年全厂社会主义竞赛的公约，其内容为：（一）用节约原料和半制品的方法在一九五二年额外生产六吨纱，一万二千公尺未加工的布料，二万公尺布匹；（二）按各种品类，出产百分之九十五头等纱（国家规定的计划为百分之九十二点八），出产百分之九十九头等布料（计划为百分之九十三点七），出产头等布匹百分之九十九点五
    （计划为百分之九十九点三）；（三）超计划减低产品成本八十万卢布；（四）提高机器生产率：纺纱机超计划百分之一，织布机超计划百分之二点三；（五）提高劳动生产率：纺纱超计划百分之二，织布超计划百分之三，清理超计划百分之五；
    （六）用更好使用和更好修理的办法减少设备的停顿：仪器超计划百分之零点五，纺纱机超计划百分之零点五，织布机超计划百分之零点六；（七）在技术设备的修理方面：优等地修理机器和车床的数量达百分之七十五，超计划减低修理工作和建筑工作的成本百分之五；（八）超计划节约七万五千瓩时电量和百分之二燃料；（九）在纺纱和织布生产上施行情况登记制度；（十）用减少停顿的办法增加工厂汽车的昼夜行驶，改善汽车修理和供应的质量百分之十；（十一）吸收一百五十人到生产技术训练班学习，二百人到斯塔哈诺夫式工作者学校学习，二百人到指定的训练班学习；（十二）保证完成训练职工一千一百人的三年计划；（十三）提前完成住宅建筑计划；（十四）向莫斯科台尔曼工厂全体人员作社会主义竞赛的挑战。
    这个竞赛公约集中表现了库巴维因工厂全体人员的先进经验、智慧和决心。库巴维因工厂的例子，说明了工人的倡议在苏联工厂是怎样有组织地迅速实现着。
    罗日聂娃和柯诺年科的倡议提出之后，苏联轻工业部和纺织工会中央委员会立刻批准它，推荐它给所有纺织工厂和轻工业工厂。苏联轻工业部副部长斯波雷雪维发表谈话说：“库巴维因工厂纺织工人的倡议具有巨大国民经济意义。其价值在于吸引全体人员都去发掘生产潜在力量。”“应当这样地组织工作，就是要使每个工人都知道，他面前摆着什么样的任务，他应当达到什么样的指标。这将使工人充分发挥创造性，使更多的工人提出建议，提高每一个人对集体成绩的责任心。在组织这个工作时，经济领导人员应当非常注意工人们在讨论一九五二年计划的生产会议上所提的意见和建议。应当迅速无阻地实现每个有价值的建议。发掘新的潜在力量，是重大而细致的工作。应当有组织地在全体人员积极参加下进行。”“为胜利完成一九五二年计划发掘新潜在力量”的倡议，已经得到莫斯科纺织企业、轻工业企业和罗斯多夫“红阿克塞”机器制造厂的响应。劳动报为此在十天中发表了两次社论，指出这一倡议也可以运用到重工业和运输业的一切企业中去。
