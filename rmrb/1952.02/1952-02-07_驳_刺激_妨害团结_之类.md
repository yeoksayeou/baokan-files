    Refuting Arguments Such as "Stimulating" and "Harming Unity"
    Wang Che
    Since the start of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign, there has been much discussion in the streets and alleys. The general public generally expresses warm support, but a small number of people still have the following arguments:
    "Saying that the bourgeoisie are launching a frenzied attack is too stimulating!"
    "Isn't today the united front of four friends? Such a large-scale campaign will harm unity, right!"
    Those who make such arguments are probably of two types: one is capitalists who attempt to resist the movement, their purpose in clamoring is to create ideological confusion and deflect the spearhead aimed at them; the other is people who have no malicious intent, but whose thinking has not been cleared up. The former should be refuted, and the latter should be explained to.
    Stimulating? Not at all. The bourgeoisie has been attacking us for three years, and the scale and harm are astonishing. Now the Party and the People's Government are sounding the alarm and calling on us to repel it, which is a good thing. As a result, many capitalists are shouting "stimulating," "stimulating." Indeed, they have received too little "stimulation" in the attacks they have launched over the past three years. If they are not stimulated again, they really don't know how rampant they will become.
    Are the national bourgeoisie still considered friends? Of course, they are friends. But we have a principle for making friends with the national bourgeoisie, which is the Common Program. It is very good if national capitalists abide by the Common Program. But it is not acceptable for national capitalists to bribe, evade taxes, and steal state property, violating the Common Program. Thus, there must be struggle.
    If the capitalists who have committed bribery can thoroughly confess and sincerely repent, the People's Government will give them lenient treatment. Die-hard big merchants who are unrepentant are no longer friends, but enemies who undermine the people's democratic cause. Will eliminating them harm the unity of the united front? Nonsense! Can the united front include "tigers"? How can you be friends with "tigers"! Raising a tiger is inviting disaster, harming yourself. The more thoroughly we eliminate the big merchants, the purer and more consolidated our ranks will be.
    Conclusion: The argument that the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign is "too stimulating" and "will harm unity" is completely unreasonable. Regardless of the subjective intentions of those who hold this view, objectively it requires us to adopt an attitude of concession and tolerance towards the bourgeoisie's attack. However, we cannot do this, because Chairman Mao told us long ago:
    "Unity through struggle survives, unity through concession perishes."

    驳“刺激”“妨害团结”之类
    王澈
    反贪污、反行贿运动开始以来，街头巷尾，议论纷纷，各阶层人民一般表示热烈拥护，可是一小部分人还有如下的论调：
    “说资产阶级猖狂进攻，太刺激了！”
    “今天不是四个朋友的统一战线么？这样大张旗鼓地反起来，会妨害团结吧！”
    发出这类议论的，大概有两种人：一种是企图对抗运动的资本家，他们叫嚷的目的是造成思想混乱，拨开刺向他们的矛头；另一种是并无恶意，只是思想没有搞通的人。对前一种人要驳斥，对后一种人要解释。
    刺激么？一点也不错。资产阶级向我们进攻了三年，规模之大，为害之烈，十分惊人。现在党和人民政府敲起警钟，号召我们打退它，这是件好事。于是许多资本家就“刺激”呀“刺激”呀地叫嚷起来了。的确，三年来他们在进攻中所受到的“刺激”太少了。再不刺激一下子，那真不知道会猖狂到什么田地。
    民族资产阶级还算不算朋友呢？当然算朋友。但我们跟民族资产阶级有个做朋友的原则基础，就是共同纲领。民族资本家遵守共同纲领，那很好。但民族资本家行贿、偷税、盗窃国家财产，违反共同纲领，那不行。这样就得有斗争。
    行贿的资本家如果能够彻底坦白，真心悔改，人民政府是会给以宽大处理的。顽硬到底的大奸商，则已经不是什么朋友，而是破坏人民民主事业的敌人了。把他们清除掉，会妨害统一战线的团结吗？笑话！统一战线内还能包括“老虎”？跟“老虎”，怎么能做朋友！养虎贻患，害的是自己。我们越是把大奸商清除得干净，我们的队伍越是纯洁，越是巩固。
    结论：认为反贪污、反行贿运动“太刺激”，“会妨害团结”的说法，根本没有道理。不论持这种论调的人主观意图如何，客观上都是要求我们对资产阶级的进攻采取退让容忍的态度。但是，我们不能够这样做，因为毛主席早就告诉我们：
    “以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡。”
