    【新华社十九日讯】为纪念二月二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志，在十八日代表全国青年写信给各殖民地、半殖民地和附属国家的青年，对他们的反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立的斗争，表示支援。该信全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    值此反对殖民制度斗争日，我谨代表中国青年，向殖民地、半殖民地与附属国家的青年朋友们致兄弟般的敬礼！一年来你们在反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立的英勇斗争中进一步壮大了自己，你们英勇的斗争已成为你们国家中争取人民民主、争取青年美好将来与保卫世界和平的一支重要力量。
    经过艰苦斗争战胜了帝国主义的新中国青年，时刻关怀着你们的生活，支持你们的正义斗争。为了保卫祖国、保卫东方与世界和平，中国青年积极参加抗美援朝，与朝鲜人民并肩作战，已经给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击。我们深信胜利必属于被压迫人民的解放事业，祝你们在摆脱野蛮的殖民制度的斗争中获得更大的成就。
