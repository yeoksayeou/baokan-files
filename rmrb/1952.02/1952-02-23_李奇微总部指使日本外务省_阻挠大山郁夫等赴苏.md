    李奇微总部指使日本外务省
    阻挠大山郁夫等赴苏
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社东京二十日讯：“朝日新闻”报道：日本外务省十九日决定拒绝把出国护照签发给那些要赴莫斯科出席国际经济会议的日本代表们。因此外务省就决定拒绝签发出国护照给日本代表帆足计和名和统一，本来预料他们两人在日内就要申请出国护照的。
    “朝日新闻”更进一步报道：“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人大山郁夫已申请准许出国赴苏，但是外务省也不会把出国护照发给他。
    一般人士已经获悉：吉田首相根据李奇微总部的要求，亲自下令禁止签发这类出国护照。在作这样的决定之前，日本外务省、法务府和特别审查局的代表们曾举行过几次会议。
