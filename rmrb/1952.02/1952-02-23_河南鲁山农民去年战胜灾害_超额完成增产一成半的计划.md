    Henan Lushan Farmers Overcame Disasters Last Year
    Exceeded the Plan to Increase Production by 15%
    To the Editor: In Lushan County, Henan Province, last year, rainfall was uneven, and some areas even suffered from insect pests. However, the average yield of fine grains per mu still increased by 27 jin compared to the previous year, exceeding the county's plan to increase production by 15%. More than 90% of the high-yield households per unit area appeared in mutual aid teams. For example, the Xin Zixiu mutual aid team of the special-class labor model produced an average of 310 jin of fine grains per mu, an increase of 110 jin compared to the previous year. He himself averaged 450 jin per mu on 17 mu of land. The women's Wen Xianglan mutual aid team harvested 9,500 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. Their experience in achieving high yields is: (1) Planting is done neatly. The entire team of 30 people worked together to complete planting at one time. (2) The pits are dug large. (3) A lot of fertilizer is applied, two large iron shovels of fertilizer are applied to each sweet potato, and the fertilizer is mixed with the soil so that the effect can be sustained. (4) Water frequently. Each pit is thoroughly watered to protect the seedlings and prevent drought. (5) Plant shallowly. Plant the sweet potato seedlings about two fingers deep and place the roots askew so that they can grow sweet potatoes as soon as they take root. (6) Turn the vines frequently, a total of twelve times. (7) Hoe frequently. The labor model Cheng Cunqing planted one and a half fen of taro and harvested 700 jin. Their mutual aid team planted three pumpkins and harvested 146, totaling more than 1,800 jin; they planted eight eggplants and harvested 196. There are many such deeds throughout the county, which will not be listed one by one. Organizing can increase the yield per unit area, and Lushan County's agricultural high-yield experience has confirmed this point.

    河南鲁山农民去年战胜灾害
    超额完成增产一成半的计划
    编辑同志：河南鲁山县去年雨水不均，部分地区并发生虫灾，但每亩地平均还比前年增产细粮二十七斤，超额完成了全县增产一成半的计划。单位面积高产户，百分之九十以上都出现在互助组里。如特等劳动模范辛自修互助组，每亩地平均产细粮三百一十斤，比前年增产一百一十斤。他自己十七亩地，平均每亩产四百五十斤。妇女文香兰互助组，一亩红薯收获九千五百斤。她们的丰产经验是：（一）种的齐。全组三十人一起动手，一次栽完。（二）挖坑大。（三）上粪多，一棵红薯上两大铁锨粪，并把粪和土拌匀，力量能持久。（四）浇水多，每坑都浇透，可以保苗防旱。（五）栽的浅。把红薯秧栽成二指深，把根放歪，一扎根就生红薯。（六）翻秧勤，共翻十二回。（七）锄的遍数多。劳动模范程村卿种了一分半芋头，收获七百斤。他们的互助组种了三棵南瓜，就结了一百四十六个，合一千八百余斤；种茄子八棵，摘了一百九十六个。像这样的事迹，全县很多，不一一列举了。组织起来能提高单位面积产量，鲁山县的农业丰产经验已证实了这点。    赵宗惠
