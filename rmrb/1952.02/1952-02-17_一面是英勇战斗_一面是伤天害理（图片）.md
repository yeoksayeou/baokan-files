    One Side is Heroic Battle
    One Side is Outrageous Crimes
    By Hua Junwu and Shao Yu
    I. The Volunteer Army climbs mountains and lies in snow to annihilate the enemy. Unscrupulous capitalists cut corners on military shoes.
    II. Volunteer Army drivers brave dangers to deliver ammunition to the front lines. Unscrupulous capitalists use old auto parts as new parts to sabotage military transport.
    III. The Volunteer Army struggles arduously, eating parched flour and snow. Unscrupulous capitalists, devoid of conscience, use rotten meat to make military canned goods.
    IV. Volunteer Army soldiers are wounded in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea but remain on the front lines. Unscrupulous capitalists outrageously use dirty cotton to make first-aid kits.
    V. The shameless crimes of奸商 [deceptive merchants] cannot escape the people's justice!
