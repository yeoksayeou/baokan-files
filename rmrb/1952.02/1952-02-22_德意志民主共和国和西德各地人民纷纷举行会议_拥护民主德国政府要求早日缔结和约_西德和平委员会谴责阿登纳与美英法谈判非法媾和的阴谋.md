Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th: According to TASS, the entire German people are enthusiastically supporting the GDR government's letter to the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, regarding the demand for an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

The GDR government receives a large number of letters and telegrams from all over the GDR every day, supporting its demands. The Standing Committee of the Saxony Metal Workers' Union, representing 300,000 workers, expressed its gratitude for the government's efforts in a telegram and promised to achieve new labor achievements in the implementation of this year's national economic plan, in order to support the government's unwavering peace policy. The Democratic Women's League of Saxony-Anhalt issued a statement saying that the Republic's government's move to demand an early peace treaty is an important effort to safeguard the peace and happiness of the German people. The Central Committee of the National Democratic Party of Mecklenburg said in a telegram to Premier Grotewohl that the GDR government is firmly defending the inviolable basic rights of the German people. The Berlin Peace Committee also issued a statement expressing its gratitude to the Republic's government for raising the demand for an early peace treaty to the four major powers, seven years after the surrender of Hitler's Germany.

In cities and enterprises throughout the GDR, working people held meetings one after another, expressing their support for the government's proposal. They also wrote letters to the people of West Germany, calling on them to support this proposal.

The people of West Germany and West Berlin also warmly support the GDR government's proposal. The Committee of German Workers Against Re-militarization issued a statement in Dusseldorf, the industrial center of the Ruhr area in West Germany, pointing out that the GDR government's proposition to the four major powers has won the support of the entire German people, especially the German working class. The statement said: "The entire working class in West Germany has begun to realize that they must play a decisive role in the struggle to win the unification of the motherland, to conclude a peace treaty, and to withdraw all occupying forces."

The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League of West Germany issued a circular to all young people in West Germany, calling on them to step up their opposition to the Bonn government's conscription law and the so-called "peace agreement," and to participate more broadly in the German people's struggle to conclude a peace treaty and restore German unity. The circular emphatically called on all young people in West Germany to demand that members of the Bonn parliament support the GDR's proposal. The circular also called on young people to take active actions to "explain to the people the important significance of this new proposal of the GDR government."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th: According to TASS, the West German Peace Committee, located in Dusseldorf, recently issued a statement warmly supporting the demand for an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, as put forward by the GDR government in its letter to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the 13th.

The statement of the West German Peace Committee first exposed the Adenauer government's conspiracy to negotiate an illegal "peace agreement" with the United States, Britain, and France, pointing out that this agreement attempts to prevent Germany from regaining independence and unity, and attempts to subject Germany to the scourge of war again. The statement then pointed out that the realization of the GDR government's demand for an early conclusion of a peace treaty is in the interests of the entire German people.

The statement said: All peace-loving men and women in Germany and Europe have been revitalized because Premier Grotewohl's letter pointed out the path that must be taken immediately, which is to avoid war and ensure peace by relying on mutual understanding between the German people and the governments of the four major powers. The people of West and East Germany are actively supporting the GDR government's proposal with all their hearts.

The West German Peace Committee finally told the West German people: The time has come, and all people, organizations, and groups that want to eliminate the dangerous situation and strive for peace must jointly demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, in order to force the federal government to support the GDR government's proposal.
