Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The 122nd expanded session of the Central People's Government Administration Council was held on the afternoon of the 1st. The meeting heard a report by Mayor Peng Zhen of Beijing on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing. Mayor Peng, while explaining in detail the basic situation of Beijing's resolute counterattack against the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks and the great achievements already made, said: Currently, in Beijing, whether in government agencies, organizations, enterprises, schools, or the business community, the entire movement has entered the stage of investigating major embezzlers and thieves. To date, 37 major embezzlers with more than 100 million yuan in embezzlement have been found within government agencies. In the business community, 989 industrial and commercial households have been found to have stolen state property worth more than 10 million yuan through illegal means such as bribery, using substandard materials, and stealing economic intelligence; among them, 192 households with more than 100 million yuan each have stolen more than 200 billion yuan of state assets. Based on the materials already gathered, the number of major embezzlers and thieves who have not confessed or have not thoroughly confessed far exceeds this number. To this end, Beijing is now concentrating its efforts to vigorously pursue major embezzlers and thieves while continuing to investigate small and medium-sized embezzlers.

Mayor Peng Zhen then, based on the materials already obtained in Beijing's investigation of embezzlement and the fight against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, use of substandard materials, and theft of economic intelligence, proved item by item the frenzy and viciousness of the bourgeoisie's attack on us. Mayor Peng Zhen said: More than 32,000 industrial and commercial households in Beijing have already confessed their problems, accounting for approximately 65 percent of the city's total. The materials prove that all industrial and commercial households that engaged in bribery, theft of state property, and theft of economic intelligence were almost all systematically attacking the state. They not only sought exorbitant profits but also undermined national defense construction and other national construction endeavors. In this struggle, Beijing discovered that law-breaking capitalists mixed a large amount of sand into the vegetables sold to comfort the volunteers and even used recycled rubber to make rubber legs for wounded volunteers. Among the embezzlers who have confessed and been reported in Beijing's government agencies, about 80 percent are related to the enticement and corruption of the business community, and many embezzlers themselves are bourgeois elements who have infiltrated or economic spies sent by the bourgeoisie to state organs. Today, the bourgeoisie is so widespread and severely violating laws and regulations, undermining the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and attacking the people's regime—with more than 3,000 industrial and commercial households in Beijing alone seriously violating the law. If we do not resolutely fight back and punish them according to law, and allow them to continue to develop, more state personnel will be corroded by the bourgeoisie's poison. Even within the business community itself, under this bad atmosphere, fewer and fewer will not break the law, and more and more law-breaking industrial and commercial households will have to be severely punished. Therefore, all sectors unanimously believe that the policies of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, and anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-use of substandard materials, and anti-theft of economic intelligence proposed by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government are very timely. This not only saves some state personnel with weak wills who may have gone astray but also saves the majority of industrialists and businessmen. In the struggle, there will indeed be a group of extremely evil lawless merchants and major embezzlers who will be executed, but this is precisely to punish the few and reform and educate the majority. Only through struggle can we achieve the goals of unity and transformation and fully conform to the interests of all the people (including the bourgeoisie). Only in this way can our people's democratic united front be further consolidated, and the bourgeoisie can also, through continuous transformation, move forward along the path of new democracy together with all the people. Otherwise, the state and the people will suffer losses, and the bourgeoisie will face the irreparable danger of sinking deeper and deeper into the mire and increasing their illegal crimes.

Finally, Mayor Peng Zhen reported that, in order to resolutely crack down on the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks, the Beijing Savings and Inspection Committee has organized forces and instructed the heads of each unit to take personal responsibility for tracking down the major embezzlers hiding within the government agencies. At the same time, in addition to continuing to call on industrial and commercial households to confess and report, 160 inspection teams have been formed to continue to conduct inspections of industrial and commercial households in a step-by-step manner. In short, we will not stop until the task is thoroughly completed!

    彭真市长在政务院会议上作报告  
    北京市正乘胜追击大贪污犯大盗窃犯  
    坚决打击资产阶级的猖狂进攻，不彻底完成任务，决不罢手
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府政务院第一百二十二次政务会议于一日下午扩大举行。会议听取了北京市彭真市长所作的关于北京市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动情况的报告。彭市长在详细说明北京市坚决回击资产阶级猖狂进攻的基本情况和已经获得的巨大成绩时说：目前，北京市无论是在机关、团体、企业、学校以及工商界中，整个运动都已进入清查大贪污犯、大盗窃犯的阶段。迄今为止，在机关内部已经查出贪污一亿元以上的大贪污犯三十七名；在工商界中，也已经查出以行贿、偷工减料和盗窃经济情报等不法手段，盗窃国家财产在一千万元以上的工商户九百八十九家；其中，一亿元以上的一百九十二家，就盗窃了国家资财二千亿元以上。而根据已经掌握的材料来看，没有坦白或没有彻底坦白的大贪污犯、大盗窃犯，还远超过此数。为此，北京市现正集中力量，乘胜追击大贪污犯、大盗窃犯；同时，继续清查中小贪污分子。
    彭真市长接着根据北京市在清查贪污和反对行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家财产、偷工减料、盗窃经济情报斗争中已得的材料，逐项证明资产阶级对我进攻的猖狂性和恶毒性。彭真市长说：北京市已经交代问题的工商户已达三万二千余户，约占全市工商户的百分之六十五。材料证明凡是行贿、盗骗国家财产、盗窃经济情报的工商户，几乎都是有计划地在向国家进攻。他们不仅牟取暴利，而且破坏国防建设和国家其他各种建设事业。北京市在这次斗争中就发现违法的资本家在卖给慰劳志愿军的菜里掺杂大量沙子，甚至为志愿军伤员制造的橡胶腿也用再生胶；而在北京市机关已经坦白和被检举的贪污分子中，约有百分之八十是与工商界的引诱、腐蚀有关的，其中且有不少贪污分子本身就是资产阶级分子混入，或是资产阶级派到国家机关的经济内奸。今天，资产阶级已经如此普遍地和严重地违法乱纪、破坏人民政协共同纲领，进攻人民政权——仅北京市严重违法的即有三千家以上工商户，那末，如果不予坚决回击和法律惩处，听任其继续发展下去，将会有更多的国家工作人员被资产阶级的毒害所腐蚀，即工商界本身，在此恶劣的风气下面，不犯法的势将愈来愈少，而必须严加惩处的违法工商户必将愈来愈多。因此，各界一致认为毛主席和中央人民政府提出的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家财产、反偷工减料、反盗窃经济情报的方针是十分适时的。这不仅挽救了一些意志薄弱、可能失足的国家工作人员，也同样地挽救了多数工商业者。在斗争中，的确有一批罪大恶极的不法奸商和大贪污犯要被处刑，但这正是惩治少数，改造和教育了多数。只有经过斗争，才能达到团结、改造的目的，才能完全符合全体人民（也包括资产阶级）的利益。也只有这样，我们的人民民主统一战线才能更加巩固，资产阶级也才能在不断改造中和全体人民一起，循着新民主主义的轨道向前发展。否则，国家、人民固然会蒙受不利，资产阶级更将因泥足愈陷愈深、违法罪行增多增大而遭致不可救药的危险。
    最后，彭真市长报告说，为了坚决打击资产阶级的猖狂进攻，北京市节约检查委员会已组织力量，并责成各单位首长亲自负责，追查潜藏在机关内部的大贪污犯；同时，除继续号召工商户坦白检举外，已组成一百六十个检查组，继续有步骤地对工商户进行检查。总之，不彻底完成任务，决不罢手！
