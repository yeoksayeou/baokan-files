    Wu Shimin, Clerk of China Industrial Equipment Company,
    Exposed the Unscrupulous Merchant Who Instructed Him to be a "Mole"
    Editor: Wu Shimin, a clerk in the Storage and Transportation Department of the China Industrial Equipment Company, was originally a shop assistant at the Shanghai Yonghua Industrial Raw Materials Firm. He had helped capitalists evade taxes and bribe cadres. Last May, when the China Industrial Equipment Company was recruiting employees in East China, he was instructed by the manager of Yonghua Firm to infiltrate the state-owned enterprise as a "mole." After arriving at the head office in Beijing, although he was assigned to work in the Storage and Transportation Department, making it difficult for him to understand the company's business and achieve the goal of stealing national economic intelligence, he still tried every means to find information. Last October, he went to Shanghai under the pretext of business and secretly copied the names, quantities, and specifications of chemical industrial products on the incoming invoices from the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries, giving a copy to Yonghua Industrial Raw Materials Firm. He also introduced the manager's nephew of Yonghua Firm to the Industrial Equipment Company of the Central and Southern District as an "inside agent" in the name of the head office.
    After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, he became uneasy and feared punishment, and he never dared to confess boldly. However, with the help of his comrades, especially after attending the public trial of corrupt officials in Beijing and hearing the report by Director Bo Yibo at the meeting, he eliminated his concerns and thoroughly confessed how he infiltrated the state-owned economic organs and supplied materials to unscrupulous merchants, and he also exposed the illegal activities of the manager of Yonghua Firm, such as tax evasion, selling fake goods, bribing cadres, engaging in black market transactions, and fraudulently obtaining import licenses. I believe that the local government should severely punish the illegal merchants Yu Shouchang, Yu Shouchi, etc., the managers of Yonghua Industrial Raw Materials Firm.

### 中国工业器材公司办事员吴石民  检举了指使他当“坐探”的奸商

    中国工业器材公司办事员吴石民
    检举了指使他当“坐探”的奸商
    编辑同志：中国工业器材公司储运处办事员吴石民，原是上海永华工业原料行的店员。他曾帮助资本家偷税、逃税和贿赂干部。去年五月，中国工业器材公司在华东招考职员时，他受永华行经理的指使，混入国营企业当“坐探”。他到北京总公司后，虽因分配在储运处工作，很难了解公司的业务情况，不能达到盗窃国家经济情报的目的，但他仍到处钻空子找材料。去年十月，他借故去上海，把苏联、新民主主义国家到货发票上的化学工业品品名、数量、规格等留底抄给永华工业原料行一份，并以总公司的名义，介绍永华行经理的外甥，打入中南区工业器材公司作“内奸”。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，他坐立不安、怕受处分，总是不敢大胆坦白。可是在同志们的帮助下，特别是在参加北京公审贪污犯大会和听到薄一波主任在大会上的报告后，他消除了顾虑，彻底交代了自己打入国营经济机关和供给奸商材料的经过，并检举了永华行经理的偷税逃税、卖假货行贿干部、做黑市买卖、骗取进口执照等非法行为。我认为当地政府应该严惩不法奸商永华工业原料行经理虞寿常、虞寿慈等。
