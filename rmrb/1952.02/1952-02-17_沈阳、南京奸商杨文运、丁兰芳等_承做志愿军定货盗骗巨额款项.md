Xinhua News Agency report: Recently, various localities have successively exposed unscrupulous industrialists and merchants for their crimes of stealing people's comfort funds by cutting corners, using inferior goods to impersonate good ones, and raising prices in the production of materials to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. These unscrupulous industrialists and merchants have adopted such outrageous behavior towards the great cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and towards the most beloved Volunteer Army soldiers of the people of the whole country, fully exposing the class nature of the bourgeoisie's self-interest and profit-seeking.

The big profiteer Yang Wenyun, arrested by the Shenyang Municipal People's Government not long ago, is a villain who sabotages the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. His iron factory's production shrank day by day during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and eventually came to a complete standstill, so that it was changed into a tofu workshop. After the liberation of Shenyang, this factory was restored with the help of the People's Government, and it has developed greatly. However, this profiteer "crossed the river and demolished the bridge," pursuing illegal profits by any means. Shortly after the start of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, he undertook to produce a batch of anti-skid chains for automobiles for the logistics department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He took advantage of the fact that the staff of the logistics department did not understand the market situation, raised the price during the price negotiation, exceeding the reasonable price by more than 400 million yuan; the agreed loss rate also exceeded the normal loss rate by 10%. At that time, the processing tasks undertaken by Yang Wenyun exceeded the capacity of his factory equipment by more than 60 times. Someone asked him, "Isn't it nonsense to take on such a big job?" He replied, "To hell with it, let's get tens of billions first." He subcontracted part of the project to dozens of small blacksmith households at a price of only 35% to 60% of the original price, and he also pulled together 400 temporary workers, most of whom were not skilled workers. He bought a large amount of scrap iron from the market, including reinforced iron bars from the Kuomintang bandit army's rotten bunkers and rusty iron sheets. He used these scraps to replace a part of the good raw materials handed over to him by the logistics department of the Volunteer Army. The chains made of this kind of waste material were naturally not up to standard, and some chain links even had a half-inch wide opening. Yang Wenyun instructed people to mix rice with furnace ash and iron powder to cover the opening, and mix this batch of bad chains into other chains to get away with it by delivering goods at night. The amount he stole by this method has been found to be 1 billion yuan, not including the large amount of stolen raw materials. As for the damage caused by this behavior to the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, it is impossible to calculate.

Gu Xielin, Gao Fushou and other 45 temporary workers of Xinchang and Xinling Leather Craft Cooperatives in Nanjing recently jointly reported Ding Lanfang and Tong Xuejin, the capitalists of these two craft cooperatives. In their letter of accusation, they pointed out that after the start of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Volunteer Army troops had successively ordered a batch of leather cases for telephones from Xinchang, with a price of over 1.16 billion yuan; and ordered a batch from Xinling, with a price of over 1.04 billion yuan. Both of them originally wanted to swallow this huge order alone and had competed with each other on the listed prices. Later, Gu Xiangshun, an unscrupulous merchant from Shanghai Xiangshun Leather Goods Store, mediated. Gu Xiangshun said: "Everyone is on the same side, don't be emotional. The result of secretly competing with each other is that no one will make money. We should 'unite' and not let the Volunteer Army take advantage of us!" After that, they colluded with each other and planned to steal a huge amount of money from the Volunteer Army. They cut corners drastically in the production and used inferior goods to impersonate good ones. For example, the quotation clearly stated that the leather cases should be made of yellow cattle hide, but the profiteer Ding Lanfang used horse and donkey hide instead of cattle hide. Each foot of yellow cattle hide costs 12,000 yuan, while each foot of horse and donkey hide is only worth 4,000 yuan, with a price difference of three times. Horse and donkey hides are of poor quality and will mildew, crack and break after being exposed to the sun and rain. For another batch of orders, the contract stipulated that all leather must be made of tanned leather, but the profiteer Ding Lanfang etc. used gallnut-made leather to impersonate it. Leather made of gallnut is easy to rot and break, and the service life is only six-tenths of that of tanned leather. In order to make a fortune, this group of profiteers completely disregarded the great harm that this batch of shoddy goods would cause after being transported to the front line. This group of profiteers also shamelessly used the name of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea" to deceive and exploit workers. They increased the workers' daily working hours to fourteen or five hours, and many workers' bodies were exhausted. When the workers sent representatives to request a reduction in working hours, the profiteer Ding Lanfang said: "This is the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The front line urgently needs this batch of goods. If we don't work overtime, we won't be able to catch up. Aren't you the working class the most patriotic and the most loving to the Volunteer Army? How can you shout after working a few more hours!" The "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea" they talked about turned out to be stealing state assets and squeezing the blood and sweat of workers.

    沈阳、南京奸商杨文运、丁兰芳等
    承做志愿军定货盗骗巨额款项
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：最近各地陆续揭发了不法工商业者在承制支援中国人民志愿军的物资中偷工减料、以劣货冒充好货、抬高价格等窃取人民慰劳款项的罪行。这些不法工商业者对伟大的抗美援朝事业，对全国人民最亲爱的志愿军战士采取了这种丧心病狂的行为，充分暴露了资产阶级损人利己、唯利是图的阶级本质。
    沈阳市人民政府不久前逮捕的大奸商杨文运，就是一个破坏抗美援朝事业的蟊贼。他所开设的铁工厂，在国民党反动统治时期生产日益萎缩，最后完全陷于停顿，以致改成了豆腐房。沈阳解放以后，这个厂依靠人民政府的扶助复业，并有了很大发展。可是这个奸商却“过河拆桥”，不择手段地追求非法利润。抗美援朝运动开始后不久，他承做中国人民志愿军后勤部一批汽车用的防滑链子。他以后勤部工作人员不了解市场情况为可欺，在议价时抬高价格，比合理价格超过四亿多元；议定的损耗率也超过正常损耗率百分之十。当时杨文运承揽的加工任务，超过他的工厂设备能力六十多倍，有人问他：“揽这么大的活不是胡闹吗？”他竟回答说：“管他娘的，先弄他几十个亿再说。”他把一部分工程以只合原价百分之三十五到百分之六十的价格，转包给几十家小铁匠户，自己又拉凑了四百个临时工，这些临时工大都不是技术工人。他从市场上收买了大批废铁料，这些废铁料中有过去从国民党匪军烂碉堡里扒出来的洋灰铁筋，有生了厚锈的铁片等等。他用这些废料偷换了志愿军后勤部交给他的一部分好原料。用这种废料打出来的链子自然不合规格，有的链环还张着半分宽的口子，杨文运就指使人用大米饭拌上炉灰、铁粉把缺口糊住，将这批坏链子混在其他链子内乘晚间送货蒙混过去。他用这种办法窃取的款项据已查出的就有十亿元，还不包括盗窃去的大量原料在内。至于这种行为对于抗美援朝事业所造成的损害就无法计算。
    南京市新昌、新陵两家皮革工艺社的临时工人顾燮林、高福寿等四十五人，最近联名检举了这两家工艺社的资方丁兰芳和童学金。他们在检举信中指出：抗美援朝运动开始以后，志愿军部队曾陆续向新昌订购电话机皮袋一批，货价为十一亿六千多万元；向新陵订购一批，货价为十亿四千多万元。他们两家原来都想独吞这一笔巨额定货，曾经在标价上相互竞争。后来上海祥顺皮件号奸商顾祥顺从中调解。顾祥顺说：“大家都是自己人，不要意气用事。暗争的结果彼此都赚不到钱，我们应该‘团结’起来，不要让志愿军把便宜占了去！”此后，他们便狼狈为奸，有计划地盗骗志愿军的巨额货款。他们在承制中大肆偷工减料，以坏充好。例如估价单上明明写着皮袋应用黄牛皮做，但奸商丁兰芳却用马皮、驴皮冒充牛皮。黄牛皮每尺要一万二千元，马皮、驴皮每尺只值四千元，价格相差三倍。马皮、驴皮质量差，经过日晒，雨淋，就会发霉、裂开、折断。又如另一批定货的合同上规定所有皮革都必须用烤胶皮，但奸商丁兰芳等用五倍子制皮冒充。五倍子制成的皮革容易腐烂、折断，使用年限不及烤胶皮十分之六。这批奸商为了发财，就根本不顾这一批偷工减料的东西运到前线后会造成多么大的危害。这批奸商还无耻地利用“抗美援朝”的名义欺骗、剥削工人。他们把工人每天的工时增加到十四五个小时，很多工人的身体都累坏了。当工人推派代表去要求减少工作时间时，奸商丁兰芳说：“这是抗美援朝的神圣任务，前线需要这批东西很急，不加钟点便赶不上。你们工人阶级不是最爱祖国、最爱志愿军吗？怎么多做了几点钟的工就叫喊起来了！”他们嘴里所说的“抗美援朝”，原来就是盗窃国家资财，榨取工人血汗。
