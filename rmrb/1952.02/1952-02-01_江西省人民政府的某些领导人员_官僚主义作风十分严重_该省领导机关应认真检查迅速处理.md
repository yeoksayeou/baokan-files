    [This Newspaper Dispatches] Certain leading personnel of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government have a serious bureaucratic work style, which has fostered corruption, waste, and violations of law and discipline among some cadres. Although this serious situation has been repeatedly exposed by lower-level cadres, and the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee have repeatedly offered opinions, the problem has not been thoroughly resolved. Here are two prominent examples.
    (1) In February 1951, someone wrote to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, exposing the actions of cadres in Jinxi County, Fuzhou Special District, Jiangxi Province, who violated policies, engaged in corruption and waste, and infringed upon human rights. On March 19, the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee ordered the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government to investigate and handle the matter and submit a report. Subsequently, the Fuzhou Special District Commissioner's Office sent a deputy commissioner to Jinxi County to conduct an investigation. On May 29, Zhang Liwen, commissioner of the Fuzhou Special District, and Nie Xianshu, deputy commissioner, jointly reported to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government and the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee, stating that certain cadres in Jinxi County did indeed have serious problems. These problems should be primarily attributed to County Chief Yang Jianzhong, and it was recommended that Yang Jianzhong be removed from his post. The report also pointed out that because "the Special District Commissioner's Office did not provide sufficient leadership to the county and failed to handle the matter effectively in a timely manner, it should also bear considerable responsibility, and a request is made to the higher authorities for punishment." After receiving this report, the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee sent a letter to the Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee, instructing it to work with the Provincial People's Government to promptly propose handling opinions and submit a report. In June, the Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee, in conjunction with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, sent personnel to Jinxi County for inspection and discovered a series of serious problems. However, the inspection work ended as early as June 25, but it was not until August 31 that the Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee reported to the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee, and no handling opinions were proposed. The Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee had no director or deputy director in office for a long time, and all documents were signed and issued by the chairman or vice-chairman of the Provincial People's Government. The Provincial Government was fully aware of these circumstances, but they did not deal with such a serious problem. Later, after repeated urging from the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, the problems in Jinxi County were finally resolved recently.
    (2) In March 1951, the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee learned that the situation of moldy public grain in Jiangxi Province was very serious, so it joined with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central-South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to send people to Jiangxi to inspect the financial and grain situation. The inspection revealed that many county organs used illegal methods (such as concealing over-collected public grain in 1950, embezzling public grain, concealing surplus grain, failing to deposit recovered agricultural loans into the treasury, failing to clear long-overdue borrowed grain, failing to hand over arrears of public grain taxes, using land tax funds, failing to report grain seized from enemies and puppets, failing to report public security and judicial fines, withholding donations for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, and illegally selling naval iron plates, etc.) to obtain state assets and establish so-called "small family treasuries." Moreover, many units, including the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, illegally engaged in commercial activities. At the district and township levels, there were behaviors that infringed upon the interests of the masses, such as arbitrary apportionment, conscription of laborers, and random issuance of grain coupons.
    This inspection work ended at the end of April. Fan Shiren, Vice Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, attended the report meeting of the inspection team and said, "I basically know these materials. There are many serious problems in Jiangxi." Later, after the relevant organs of the Central-South region studied the above problems, the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee put forward handling opinions in June and July: 1. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government should further conduct in-depth inspections of these serious chaotic phenomena, take effective measures, and quickly correct them. 2. Cadres who have generally violated discipline and systems may generally not be punished, but responsibility should be ascertained, and cadres should be educated. Those with serious circumstances must be given due punishment and, if necessary, sent to the People's Court for punishment. 3. "Small family treasuries" should be unified under leadership and managed centrally to develop local industry. (Editor's note: "Small family treasuries" should be resolutely abolished, not a matter of centralized leadership and unified management.) These opinions were approved by the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central People's Supervisory Committee, respectively. On July 25, the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee sent the report and handling opinions of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government and requested that the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government separately investigate and propose handling opinions on several existing serious problems and report them to the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee. A long time passed without a reply. On September 13, the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee telegraphed the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, ordering it to report by the 20th, but the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government still did not reply. In October, the General Office of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee made another long-distance phone call to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government. Fang Zhichun, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, answered the phone and promised to inquire about it, but there was still no follow-up. When the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee held its fourth meeting, the responsible comrades of Jiangxi Province stated that they would handle the matter quickly. A month passed without a report. It was not until November 3 that the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government issued Instruction No. 16 of the Provincial Supervision Secretarial Office, stating that it would deal with those problems. However, this was a typical bureaucratic document, and this document could not be regarded as a response to the order of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee. On the one hand, this document pointed out that the phenomena of corruption, degeneration, and bureaucratism "cannot be allowed to continue to exist," "must be resolutely opposed," and "must be quickly and thoroughly eliminated"; but on the other hand, it described the phenomena of bureaucratism, commandism, corruption, waste, and violations of law and discipline as merely problems of district and township cadres. Does the Provincial People's Government know nothing about the phenomena of bureaucratism, commandism, corruption, waste, and violations of law and discipline among cadres above the county level? The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government adopted an inappropriate attitude of resistance for roughly the following two reasons: First, as the Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee once pointed out, the Provincial People's Government had adopted a conciliatory and tolerant attitude towards cadres for a long time; second, because the leading organs were unwilling to engage in self-criticism and correct their own shortcomings, they did not dare to adopt a serious and earnest attitude to deal with the mistakes below. Regarding the latter point, several cadres of the Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee revealed in a report to the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee on September 23 that in 1950, 10 to 20 million catties of grain allocated for civil affairs in Jiangxi Province were not used. When the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee sent people to inspect in April 1951, the Department of Civil Affairs was in a flurry, rushing to create false accounts and instructing certain commissioners to create false accounts to conceal this batch of grain and no longer hand it over. Lower-level cadres were very dissatisfied with this measure. According to materials obtained by cadres of the Jiangxi People's Supervisory Committee from responsible cadres in the accounting department of the Department of Civil Affairs, this matter was "decided by the highest leader of the province." After this batch of grain was concealed, a large-scale mechanized brick and tile factory was to be built. This matter was thoroughly investigated by the Central-South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which proved that the above facts were completely true, but who the "highest leader of the province" was has not yet been found out.
    From the above materials, it can be seen that the bureaucratic work style and various violations of law and discipline of certain leading organs and certain leading personnel in Jiangxi Province are very serious and must be dealt with promptly.

    江西省人民政府的某些领导人员
    官僚主义作风十分严重  
    该省领导机关应认真检查迅速处理
    【本报讯】江西省人民政府的某些领导工作人员有着严重的官僚主义作风，助长了某些干部的贪污浪费、违法乱纪的行为。这种严重情况虽经下级干部屡次揭发，中南军政委员会和中南人民监察委员会一再提出意见，但问题一直没有得到彻底解决。下面是两个突出的例子。
    （一）一九五一年二月，有人写信给最高人民检察署，揭发江西省抚州专区金溪县的干部违犯政策、贪污浪费、侵犯人权等等行为。三月十九日，中南军政委员会命令江西省人民政府调查处理，并作报告。后经抚州专署派副专员到金溪县作了调查，并在五月二十九日，由抚州专署专员张立文、副专员聂显书联名报告江西省人民政府及中南人民监察委员会，说明金溪县的某些干部确实存在着严重问题。这些问题应该由县长杨建中负主要责任；并建议给杨建中以撤职处分。报告同时指出，因“专署对该县领导不够，未能及时予以有效处理，也应负相当责任，特请求上级处分”。中南人民监察委员会收到这个报告以后，乃致函江西人民监察委员会令其会同省人民政府迅速提出处理意见，并作报告。江西省人民监察委员会就在六月间联合中共江西省委纪律检查委员会派员到金溪县进行检查，发现了一系列的严重问题。但是检查工作早在六月二十五日结束，拖到八月三十一日才由江西省人民监察委员会报告中南人民监察委员会，而且没有提出处理意见。江西省人民监察委员会长期没有在职的主任和副主任，文件全由省人民政府主席或副主席签发，这些情况省府是完全了解的，但是他们对这样的严重问题没有处理。后来又经中南军政委员会再三督促，直到最近，金溪县的问题才得到解决。
    （二）一九五一年三月间，中南人民监察委员会闻悉江西省公粮霉烂的情况非常严重，乃联合中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会派人到江西检查财经粮食情况。检查结果，发现许多县机关用违法方法（如一九五○年超征公粮隐瞒不报，挪用公粮，隐瞒余粮，农贷收回不入库，挪用折征借粮久不清理，公粮田赋尾欠收回不上缴，动用田赋，缴获自敌伪的粮食不上报，公安司法罚款不上报，扣留抗美援朝捐款，盗卖海军铁板等等），套取国家资财，建立所谓“小家务”。而且许多单位违法经营商业，包括省文教厅在内。区乡级则发生摊派、征民工、乱发粮票等侵犯群众利益的行为。
    这次检查工作在四月底结束，江西省人民政府范式人副主席曾参加了检查组的汇报会，并说“这些材料大体都知道，江西的严重问题很多”。后来，上述问题经中南有关机关的研究，六、七月间，由中南人民监察委员会提出处理意见：一、江西省人民政府对这些严重的混乱现象应进一步深入检查，采取有效措施，迅予纠正。二、对普通违反纪律和制度的干部，一般可不处分，但应查明责任，教育干部。对情节重大的必须给以应得处分，必要时送人民法院惩办。三、“小家当”应统一领导，集中管理，以发展地方工业。（编者按：“小家当”应坚决取消，而不是集中领导和统一管理的问题。）这些意见，分别经中南军政委员会及中央人民监察委员会批准。七月二十五日中南军政委员会将中南人民监察委员会的报告和处理意见寄交江西省人民政府，并要求对江西现存若干严重问题分别查明提出处理意见报告中南军政委员会。历时甚久，未见答复。中南军政委员会又在九月十三日电江西省人民政府令其在二十日前具报，江西省人民政府仍无答复。十月，中南军政委员会办公厅又打了一次长途电话给江西省人民政府，接电话的是省人民政府方志纯副主席，答应去查问一下，但始终没有下文。中南军政委员会举行第四次会议时，江西省负责同志表示将迅速处理。过了一个月，还没见报告。直到十一月三日，江西省人民政府才发出府监秘字十六号指示，表示要处理那些问题。但这是一个典型的官僚主义的文件，这一文件决不能作为对中南军政委员会命令的答复。这一文件一面指出贪污腐化、官僚主义现象“不容继续存在下去”，“必须坚决反对”，“迅速彻底加以肃清”；但另一方面，又把官僚主义、命令主义、贪污浪费、违法乱纪的现象，说成只是区乡干部的问题。难道县以上的干部的官僚主义、命令主义、贪污浪费、违法乱纪的现象，省人民政府一概不知道吗？江西省人民政府之所以采取不应有的抗拒态度，其原因大体有以下两点：第一，正如江西省人民监察委员会曾指出的，省人民政府在很长的时间里，曾对干部采取了迁就姑息的态度；第二，就是因领导机关对本身的缺点，不肯作自我批评，改正错误，所以对下边的错误就不敢采取严肃认真的态度，加以处理。关于后一点，江西省人民监察委员会几个干部署名于九月二十三日给中南人民监察委员会的报告，曾有所揭发，即一九五○年江西省的民政事业费有一千至两千万斤粮食没有拨用，一九五一年四月中南军政委员会民政部派人前来检查时，民政厅手忙脚乱，赶造假账，并嘱某些专员造假账，想隐瞒这批粮食，不再上缴。下级干部对这种措施很为不满。根据江西人民监察委员会干部从民政厅会计部门负责干部所得到的材料，证明这一事情的“决策人为省的最高首长”。这批粮食隐瞒下来以后，要办一个规模巨大的机制砖瓦厂。这件事情经中共中央中南局电令江西彻查，证明上述事实完全是真实的，但所说的“省的最高首长”究竟是谁，还没有查出来。
    从以上材料看来，江西省的某些领导机关、某些领导人员的官僚主义作风、各种违法乱纪的行为是十分严重的，必须迅速加以处理。
