    To the Editor: The waste phenomenon at the Beijing Institute of Northern Jiaotong University is serious. According to preliminary statistics, the amount wasted reaches 1.6 billion yuan. The main reason for the waste is that the leadership's construction plans do not proceed from actual needs, but rather aim to "compete in ostentation" and "compete in extravagance"; some waste is caused by blind construction. For example, under the pretext of "regularization," the office building was designed to be magnificent, fully demonstrating extravagance and waste. Our school is an engineering school, but many intolerable errors have occurred in the construction. A car garage collapsed a few days after completion; after the boiler room was built, the tiles were removed to install the chimney; the newly built toilet was demolished and repaired, and repaired and demolished. A sports field built at a cost of 100 million yuan does not even have drainage equipment, and the field is flooded with water when it rains. In addition, there is also serious waste in the purchase of instruments by various departments. The Transportation Engineering Department spent 300 million yuan to buy a set of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) models (the level of railway sites in our country has not yet reached this level, and this instrument can be temporarily not purchased), and spent more than 140 million yuan to buy many surveying instruments, but later decided to stop offering surveying courses, and these instruments became a waste. In addition, there is also great waste in the purchase of objects. The waste phenomenon in our school is so serious that we hope that through this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, this error can be thoroughly corrected.

### 北方交通大学京院  应纠正铺张浪费现象

    应纠正铺张浪费现象
    编辑同志：北方交通大学京院的浪费现象是严重的，据初步统计，浪费的数目达十六亿元。造成浪费的主要原因是领导方面的建校计划不从实际需要出发，而是要“比排场”“比阔气”；有些浪费是由于盲目施工所造成的。譬如藉口“正规化”，把办公的大楼设计得富丽堂皇，十足表现了铺张浪费。我校是一个工程学校，但是在建筑施工上，发生了许多不可容忍的错误。一个汽车库房完工几天后，就被风刮倒；锅炉房盖好后，才揭开瓦来装烟囱；新建的厕所拆了又修，修了又拆。花了一亿元修筑的一个运动场，连排水设备也没有，一下雨，场地上就积满了水。又各系在购买仪器方面，也有严重的浪费现象。运输工程系花了三亿元买了一套中央控制行车制（C·T·C·）的模型（我国铁路现场尚未达到这个水准，这种仪器是可以暂时不买的），又花了一亿四千多万元买了许多测量仪器，后来决定停开测量课，这些仪器无异成为浪费。此外，在购买器物上也有很大浪费。我校的浪费现象是这样的严重，我们希望经过这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，能彻底纠正这种错误。
