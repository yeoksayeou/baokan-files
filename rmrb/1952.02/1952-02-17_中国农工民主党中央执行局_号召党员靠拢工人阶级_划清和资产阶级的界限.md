    [Report from this newspaper] The Central Executive Bureau of the China National Democratic Construction Association, on February 11th, issued instructions to all levels of organizations and all party members regarding promoting and deepening the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. It called on all party members to raise their vigilance in the struggle against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeoisie, and accelerate their alignment with the working class, learning the working class's ideology, work style, and way of life. The instructions specifically require every party member to honestly report their business activities and investment shares related to industry and commerce, and clearly stipulate that party members working in state organs are strictly prohibited from concurrently engaging in industry and commerce; those who are already concurrently engaged in industry and commerce should be ordered to make a clean breast of it within a limited time. Party members not working in state organs but engaged in industry and commerce must strictly abide by national economic laws and regulations and absolutely obey the leadership of the state-owned economy. The instructions call on all party members of the China National Democratic Construction Association, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to actively mobilize the masses, launch struggles, take the lead in self-criticism, break through personal connections, defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, and transform their own various non-working-class thoughts.
