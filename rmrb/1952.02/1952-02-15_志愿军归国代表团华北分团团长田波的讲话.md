Chairman, fellow representatives, comrades:

    Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The people of China and the Soviet Union, as well as all peace-loving people around the world, are today warmly celebrating this great festival of historical significance. We, the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the Korean front, share with you all the excitement and joy in warmly celebrating this festival.

    There is a long-standing and profound friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Since the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet government, based on the policies of Lenin and Stalin, was the first to abolish the unequal treaties imposed on China by the old Tsarist era. For the past thirty years, it has continuously helped the liberation cause of our people, until the establishment of the People's Republic of China. In particular, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has opened a new era of friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union. As Chairman Mao's wise assertion points out: "The unity of the people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, which has been solidified by the treaty, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world." Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is not only beneficial to the people of China and the Soviet Union but is also the hope of the people of the world, representing the interests of all mankind.

    We, the Chinese People's Volunteers, are active supporters and implementers of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. We are revolutionary soldiers educated by the great leader Chairman Mao, possessing patriotism and internationalism. We are not only the defenders of the people of our motherland but also the fighters for maintaining world peace and justice. When American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, occupied our country's Taiwan, and ignited the flames of war on our borders, we resolutely shouldered the glorious combat mission of opposing aggression and defending peace.

    In the more than fifteen months of the anti-aggression war, we have deeply realized that the ferocious and brutal American imperialists are the common enemy of the people of the world. When we set foot on the land of Korea, we could see everywhere the disasters created by the American aggressors on the Korean land; everywhere we could hear the Korean people's painful accusations. On the once free and happy Korean land, it is no longer possible to find a complete city or village. Millions of happy and free families have been destroyed. Countless innocent and lovely children have lost their mothers. Many shocking facts have educated us, increased our hatred for the enemy, and made us deeply realize that the war we are waging is just and necessary. Our struggle is not isolated. Not only are the Korean people fighting alongside us, but also the great Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all over the world are standing with us. This is an important force that inspires us to advance victoriously. Last year, on the anniversary of the October Revolution, our Volunteers collectively joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and were accepted as glorious group members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which further inspired our fighting spirit and increased our confidence. We firmly believe that "the unity and cooperation of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union are invincible."

    In more than fifteen months of combat, we have heavily struck the enemy and defeated the joint offensive of American imperialism and its accomplices from eighteen countries. From the beginning of our operations abroad until December 25th of last year, we eliminated more than 400,000 enemies, shot down or damaged more than 2,000 enemy aircraft, destroyed more than 3,000 enemy tanks, and captured more than 3,000 various types of artillery, causing significant losses to the enemy in manpower, equipment, and materials. And we ourselves have become stronger as we fought. We have continuously improved and enhanced our tactics and techniques through combat and learned the experience of modern warfare. We can not only defend but also attack. This is a favorable condition for defeating the enemy. With the full support of the people of the motherland, our equipment has gradually improved and strengthened. Now we are not only using infantry to strike the enemy but also have air force, artillery, and armored units cooperating in combat. Since our air force participated in the war, the enemy has become even more embarrassed and panicked. Our artillery and armored units have also gradually increased. In the fourth and fifth battles, the ammunition fired by our artillery units increased more than thirty times compared to the three battles before. In the summer and autumn campaigns, it increased more than one hundred and ten times. From the above facts, it can be seen that we are getting stronger as we fight, and the blows suffered by the enemy are becoming more and more severe. Before the five battles, more than 180,000 enemies were eliminated, averaging more than 900 enemies eliminated per day. After the five battles, about 300,000 enemies were eliminated, averaging more than 1,400 enemies eliminated per day. The development of the war situation is becoming more and more favorable to us day by day. We have laid a solid foundation for the final victory over the enemy. The "paper tiger" image of American imperialism, which appears strong on the outside but is weak on the inside, is becoming more and more exposed day by day. The facts of the past year have powerfully proven that "American imperialism can be defeated."

    At present, American imperialism is stepping up its war preparations and has adopted a shameful policy of delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations. It is making a separate peace treaty with Japan, stepping up the arming of Japan, and after signing the US-Japan bilateral agreement, it is also instigating the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan to sign a treaty with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who have long been spurned by the people of the world, in order to restore the forces of Japanese militarism and actively prepare to launch a new war of aggression, seriously threatening the peace of the Far East, Asia, and the people of the world.

    As we commemorate the second anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, we must further consolidate and develop the friendship and unity between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. If American imperialism continues to sabotage peace talks and adhere to its war policy, we once again swear to the people of the motherland and guarantee to the people of the world that we will carry the anti-aggression war through to the end until the US government is willing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    We firmly believe that with our great leader Chairman Mao, with the full support of the great people of our motherland, with the heroic Korean people and army fighting alongside us, and with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of the world led by the Soviet Union, the final victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea will surely be ours.

    Sino-Soviet friendship is invincible in the world!
    Long live the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!
    Long live the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Marshal Stalin!

### 志愿军归国代表团华北分团团长田波的讲话

    志愿军归国代表团华北分团团长田波的讲话主席，各位代表，各位同志：
    今天是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的两周年纪念日。中苏两大国的人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民，今天都在热烈地庆祝这一具有历史意义的伟大节日。我们战斗在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军，也和大家一样，以万分兴奋愉快的心情，热烈地庆祝这个节日。
    中苏两大民族之间，具有历史悠久的深厚友谊，自十月革命成功后，苏联政府就根据列宁和斯大林的政策，首先废除了旧俄时代对中国订立的不平等条约，三十年来，又不断地帮助了我国人民的解放事业，直到中华人民共和国的成立，特别是中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，更开辟了中苏两国人民友好合作新的时代，正如毛主席的英明论断所指出的：“业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”因此中苏条约的签订，不仅有利于中苏两国人民，也是全世界人民的希望，它代表着全人类的利益。
    我们中国人民志愿军，是中苏友好同盟互助条约的积极拥护者和执行者，我们是伟大领袖毛主席教养下的，具有爱国主义和国际主义精神的革命战士，我们不仅是祖国人民的保卫者，也是维护世界和平与正义的斗士。当美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，侵占我国的台湾，把战火燃烧到我国边境的时候，我们就毅然肩负起反对侵略，保卫和平的光荣战斗任务。
    在十五个多月的反侵略战争中，我们深刻的体会到，凶恶残暴的美帝国主义者，是全世界人民的公敌。当我们一踏上朝鲜的土地，到处都可以看到美国侵略者在朝鲜土地上所制造的灾难；到处都可以听到朝鲜人民沉痛的控诉。曾经是自由幸福的朝鲜国土上，再也找不到一个完整的城市和村庄。千万幸福自由的家庭被摧毁了。无数天真可爱的孩子失去了母亲。许多触目惊心的事实教育了我们，增加了我们对敌人的仇恨，使我们深刻认识到我们所进行的战争是正义的、必需的。我们的斗争不是孤立的，不仅有朝鲜人民和我们并肩作战，还有伟大的苏联、各人民民主国家和全世界爱好和平的人民与我们站在一起，这是鼓舞我们胜利前进的重要力量。去年十月革命节，我们志愿军集体加入中苏友好协会，被接受为光荣的中苏友好协会的团体会员，这就进一步鼓舞了我们的斗志，提高了我们的信心，我们坚信“中苏两大国家的团结合作是天下无敌的。”
    在十五个多月的战斗中，我们重重地打击了敌人，打败了美帝国主义及其帮凶十八个国家的联合进攻。从出国作战到去年十二月二十五日止，我们共消灭敌人四十多万，打落打伤敌机二千多架，击毁敌坦克三千多辆，缴获各种炮三千多门，使敌人在人力、装备、物资上都受到重大的损失。而我们自己则是愈战愈强了。我们从战斗中不断地改进和提高了战术技术，学会了现代化战争的经验，不仅能守，而且能攻，这是战胜敌人的有利条件，在祖国人民的全力支援下，我们的装备已逐渐改善与加强。现在我们已不仅是用步兵打击敌人，而且开始有空军炮兵和装甲部队配合作战了。自我们的空军参战以后，敌人更加狼狈恐慌起来。我们的炮兵和装甲部队也逐渐增强，在第四第五两次战役中，我们炮兵部队，所发射的弹药，比三次战役前增加了三十多倍，在夏秋两季作战中，更增加到一百一十多倍。从以上事实中可以看出，我们是愈战愈强，敌人所遭到的打击，是一次比一次严重。五次战役前共消灭敌人十八万多人，平均每天歼敌九百多人，五次战役后共歼敌约三十万人，平均每天歼敌一千四百多人。战局的发展一天比一天更加对我们有利。我们已奠定了最后战胜敌人的稳固基础。美帝国主义外强中干的“纸老虎”像，一天比一天暴露的更加明显了，一年来的事实，有力地证明：“美帝国主义是可以战胜的”。
    目前美帝国主义正在加紧战争准备，对朝鲜停战谈判，采取了可耻的拖延破坏政策，单独对日媾和，加紧武装日本，在订立美日双边协定后，又唆使日本吉田反动政府和早为世界人所唾弃的蒋匪残余订立和约，恢复日本军国主义势力，积极准备发动新的侵略战争，严重地威胁着远东、亚洲以及全世界人民的和平。
    当我们纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约两周年的时候，必须进一步巩固与发展中苏两大民族的友谊与团结，如果美帝国主义继续破坏和谈，坚持战争政策，我们再一次向祖国人民宣誓，向全世界人民保证，我们一定把反侵略战争进行到底，直到美国政府愿意和平解决朝鲜问题时为止。
    我们坚信，我们有伟大的领袖毛主席，有伟大的祖国人民的全力支援，有英雄的朝鲜军民和我们并肩作战，有以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平的人民的同情与支援，抗美援朝战争的最后胜利一定是我们的。
    中苏友好无敌于天下！
    中苏友好同盟互助条约万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
