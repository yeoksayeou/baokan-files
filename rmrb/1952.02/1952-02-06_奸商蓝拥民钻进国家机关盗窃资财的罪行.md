The poisonous methods by which unscrupulous merchants steal and sell state property are diverse. They feel that "pulling over" revolutionary cadres is not enough, so they simply infiltrate our national economic organs, steal and use public names, and steal state property to achieve their goals of making a fortune. The unscrupulous merchant Lan Yongmin is a typical example.

After the liberation of Shenyang, Lan Yongmin opened a civil engineering construction company in Tiexi District, gathering a group of unscrupulous merchants and foremen. With just a telephone and two sofas, he wanted to reap huge profits from our economic construction. However, this unscrupulous merchant felt that bribing cadres to steal state property was not as convenient as "getting inside," so he tried every means to "contact" state-owned construction agencies. Wearing a mask of "progress," he cheated everywhere. In March 1949, he got to know Wang Yaqing, the manager of the Northeast Veterans Engineering Company, through personal connections. Wang Yaqing did not guard against the conspiracy of the bourgeoisie to attack us, and mistakenly believed that Lan Yongmin, this businessman, was quite "progressive." Lan Yongmin initially invited Wang Yaqing to dinner, and later sent woolen overcoats and radios to Wang's home. Seeing that Wang Yaqing was hooked, he put on an even more "progressive" face, saying that he was unwilling to be a businessman and willing to "revolt," and said: "If there are really difficulties, just give me a title first." So Wang Yaqing fell into his trap. The unscrupulous merchant's civil engineering construction company hung up the sign of "Tiexi Branch of Northeast Veterans Engineering Company," and Lan Yongmin held two positions, contracting for any public construction projects and then making a fortune. This unscrupulous merchant, in the name of "public ownership" and "veterans," deceived many state-owned enterprises.

While stealing the public name, Lan Yongmin bribed Wang Yaqing with 45 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below), two gold lockets, and a camera. In order to consolidate his "public name," he bribed his "inside line," giving a total of 85 million yuan to Wang's cousin, mother-in-law, and wife. Feeling that it was not secure enough, he bribed Guan Jie, the chief of the engineering section, with 27.7 million yuan, and the engineer Liu Hengxiang with 20 million yuan. He used these despicable methods to "pull down" several cadres in the company, and then he began to steal state construction materials and cash.

On September 2, 1949, the unscrupulous merchant Lan Yongmin colluded with Guan Jie and Wang Yaqing to steal the company's seal and privately contracted a project. On December 25th of the same year, Lan Yongmin colluded with Guan Jie to steal two blank letters of introduction stamped with the company's seal, and privately transported eight trainloads of wood to Fengcheng in the name of the public, making a fortune. In the construction project, because he was flying the flag of public ownership, the construction department was negligent in inspection, and he used shoddy workmanship, underreporting and other bad means to embezzle more than 1.438 billion yuan in project funds.

In 1950, the higher authorities ordered the cancellation of the "branch company" name; but the unscrupulous merchant used methods of soft and hard blackmail to force Wang Yaqing to give him another name: "Engineering Team of Northeast Veterans Engineering Company," so Lan Yongmin became the captain of the engineering team again. At this time, seeing that a young manager, Gu Qinpu, had come to the company, he used women to drag Gu Qinpu into the water, until Gu Qinpu was dragged into "collusion" with him.

The unscrupulous merchant Lan Yongmin, under the guise of the public name, stole state assets in the project even more boldly. On April 28, 1950, he fraudulently claimed a trainload (27 tons) of white lime from the company, worth more than 40 million yuan; at the end of April, he stole 23.5 million yuan of project funds, bought two clay tile houses, and privately kept the property title deeds; in November, he stole and sold 721 scaffolding poles and 100 scaffolding boards, worth more than 40 million yuan, and stole and sold 74 cubic meters of logs from the metallurgical plant project, worth 374 million yuan, and stole and sold 24 tons of cement from the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department, worth 168 million yuan. None of the projects he contracted for were up to standard. In addition, in the two years, he used the public name to exploit and oppress workers, owing as much as 250 million yuan in wages alone.

The unscrupulous merchant Lan Yongmin bribed cadres with a total of more than 210 million yuan. He stole a large amount of state construction materials, causing the state to lose more than 2.3 billion yuan economically. Politically, he damaged the reputation and prestige of state-owned enterprises and corrupted five revolutionary cadres, a loss that is even greater.

This heinous unscrupulous merchant Lan Yongmin finally could not escape the eyes of the people and was punished by the people's government according to law. (Northeast Daily)

    奸商蓝拥民钻进国家机关盗窃资财的罪行
    奸商盗卖国家财产的毒辣方式是多种多样的。他们觉得把革命干部“拉过去”还不行，于是就干脆钻进我们国家的经济机关，偷用公家名义，盗窃国家财产，达到他们大发横财的目的。奸商蓝拥民就是一个典型的例子。
    沈阳解放后，蓝拥民在铁西区开设了一个土木建筑公司，纠合了一群奸商、把头，凭着一台电话，两张沙发，就想在我们的经济建设中获取暴利。可是，这个奸商还觉得拉拢干部盗窃国家财产不如“打进来”方便，于是他就千方百计“联系”国营修建机关。他戴着“进步”的假面具，到处欺诈。一九四九年三月间，他通过私人关系认识了东北荣军工程公司经理王雅庆。王雅庆没有警惕资产阶级向我们进攻的阴谋，错误地认为蓝拥民这个商人还挺“进步”。蓝拥民起初请王雅庆吃饭，后来就往王的家里送呢大衣，收音机。他看王雅庆上了套，就更装出“进步”的面孔，说他不愿意做商人，愿意“革命”，并说：“若实在有困难，先给我弄个名目也行。”于是王雅庆就上了他的圈套。奸商的土木建筑公司门前，挂上了“东北荣军工程公司铁西分公司”的牌子，蓝拥民一身二任，公家有什么修建工程，承包后即去发财。这个奸商以“公营”“荣军”的名义，欺骗了许多国营企业。
    盗取了公家名义的同时，蓝拥民向王雅庆行贿了四千五百万元（东北币，下同），金镏子两个、照像机一台。为了巩固他这个“公家名义”，他又向“内线”来行贿，给王的表弟、岳母和老婆共计八千五百万元。他还觉得不牢固，又向工务科长关捷行贿二千七百七十万元，向工程师刘恒祥行贿二千万元。他用这些卑鄙的手段把公司里的几个干部都“拉下水”了，于是他就开始了盗窃国家建设资财和现款。
    一九四九年九月二日，奸商蓝拥民勾结关捷和王雅庆偷用公司印章，私自承包了一项工程。同年十二月二十五日蓝拥民又勾结关捷偷出盖有公司印章的空白介绍信两封，到凤城假借公家名义私运八火车木材，发了一批横财。在修建工程中，因为他打着公营旗号，使修建部门疏于检查，他用偷工减料，以少报多等恶劣手段，贪污了工程费十四亿三千八百多万元。
    一九五○年，上级下令取消了“分公司”的名义；但是奸商用软敲硬诈的方法，逼迫王雅庆不得不再给他另一个名义：“东北荣军工程公司工程队”，于是蓝拥民又变成了工程队的队长。这时，他看公司里新来了一个年青的经理谷勤甫，就用女人来拉谷勤甫下水，直到把谷勤甫拖到和他“同流合污”为止。
    奸商蓝拥民打着公家名义，更加大胆地在工程中盗窃国家资财。一九五○年四月二十八日，从公司冒领了白块灰一火车（二十七吨），价值四千多万元；四月底，盗用工程费二千三百五十万元，买了土板房两座，私自留下了产权契约书；十一月间，盗卖了脚手杆七百二十一根，脚手板一百块，价值四千多万元，又盗卖了冶炼厂工程的原木七十四立方公尺，价值三亿七千四百万元，盗卖东北工业部化学工业局洋灰二十四吨，价值一亿六千八百万元。他所承包的工程质量没有一处合格的。另外，在两年中间，他利用公家名义剥削、压迫工人，光拖欠工资就有二亿五千多万元之多。
    奸商蓝拥民一共向干部行贿二亿一千多万元。他盗窃国家的大批建设资材，使国家在经济上损失了二十三亿多元。在政治上，破坏了公营企业的名誉和威信，腐蚀了五个革命干部，这一笔损失那就更大了。
    这个万恶的奸商蓝拥民，终于逃不出人民的眼睛，受到了人民政府的法律制裁。  （东北日报）
