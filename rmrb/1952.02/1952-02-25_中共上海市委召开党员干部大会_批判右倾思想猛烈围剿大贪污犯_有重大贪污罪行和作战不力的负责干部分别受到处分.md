Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 23rd:

    The first stage of the movement to suppress major grafters in Shanghai's first-level organizations has concluded. Generally speaking, although this campaign has achieved results, progress has been slow, and the gains have been small. The main reason is that some teams, especially the commanders, have serious right-leaning ideas. In order to reverse this slow and backward situation, the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee held a meeting of more than 2,000 party member cadres on the evening of the 20th. At the meeting, Chen Yi and Tan Zhenlin both gave important instructions. In his speech, Chen Yi first pointed out that although the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Shanghai has achieved preliminary results, it is far behind other parts of the country and significantly inadequate compared to the results it should have achieved. He urged all party member cadres to quickly take resolute and active actions to change the slow and backward state of the movement. He severely criticized the erroneous ideas existing among some party member cadres. These people lacked the necessary strong hatred for the crimes of grafters stealing state property. They were numb and lenient towards grafters, even believing that there were no problems in their units due to "favoritism" towards "old subordinates" and "old cadres." These many right-leaning erroneous ideas objectively shielded the "tigers," thus hindering the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, as well as against bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state assets, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. Other people, because they are "tigers" themselves, dream of muddling through. Chen Yi warned these people that they would not be able to get away with it, and the Party and the people would never allow them to. Chen Yi solemnly announced: "We will never withdraw our troops until the 'tigers' are completely eliminated." If any cadre hinders or obstructs the development of the movement, they must be removed from their existing positions to avoid being a hindrance to the progress of the broad masses. He emphasized that it is currently necessary to resolutely overthrow the "ideological tigers," be determined, study hard, and master the strategy and tactics of "tiger hunting" in order to quickly develop the movement. Finally, on behalf of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Chen Yi announced that fifteen responsible cadres who had committed major acts of corruption, had unclean hands, and were ineffective in fighting tigers would be punished with arrest for investigation, removal from office for investigation, removal from office, and suspension from duty for reflection.

    In his speech, Tan Zhenlin analyzed the importance of Shanghai's anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to the whole country, and made detailed explanations on the "three treasures" tactics of mastering materials, organizing firepower, and publicizing policies, and the significance and policies of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state assets, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence.

    After this meeting of party member cadres, the city's eleven "tiger hunting armies" immediately held emergency meetings, seriously criticized right-leaning ideas, formulated new battle plans, mobilized the masses, organized forces, and launched a campaign to encircle and suppress grafters. Since then, the battle situation has greatly changed. Victory reports have been pouring in from all armies. The Shanghai Retail Company Headquarters and the Shanghai Cooperatives Federation, both under the Financial and Economic Brigade, have achieved great victories.

    中共上海市委召开党员干部大会
    批判右倾思想猛烈围剿大贪污犯
    有重大贪污罪行和作战不力的负责干部分别受到处分
    【新华社上海二十三日电】上海市一级机关的围剿大贪污分子运动第一阶段已经结束。整个说来，这一战役虽已获得成绩，但进展迟缓，战果不大。主要原因是一部分队伍尤其是指挥人员，存在着严重的右倾思想。为了扭转这种迟缓落后的局面，中共上海市委员会在二十日晚召开了二千多人的党员干部大会。会上，陈毅和谭震林都作了重要指示。陈毅在讲话中首先指出：上海市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动虽已获得初步成绩，但是远远落后于全国各地，和应有的成绩比较起来显得大大地不够。他要求全体党员干部迅速以坚决的积极的行动，努力改变运动中的迟缓落后状态。他严正地批评在某些党员干部中所存在的错误思想。这些人对贪污分子盗窃国家财产的罪恶缺乏应有的强烈憎恨。他们居然麻木不仁地对贪污分子加以原谅宽恕，甚至因为对于“老部下”“老干部”的“偏爱”而认为自己单位中没有什么问题。这许多右倾错误思想在客观上就掩护了“老虎”，因此妨碍了伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。另外一些人因为本身就是“老虎”，他们梦想蒙混过关。陈毅警告这些人说：这些人是混不过关的，党和人民是决不允许他们混过去的。陈毅郑重地宣布：“老虎”不打干净，决不收兵。不论任何干部，如果妨碍或阻碍运动的开展，都一定要从现有的岗位上撤换下来，免得碍手碍脚，妨碍广大群众的前进。他强调指出：目前必须坚决打倒“思想老虎”，下定决心，好好学习并掌握住“打虎”的战略战术，才能使运动迅速开展起来。最后，陈毅代表中共上海市委员会和上海市人民政府，宣布对于犯有重大贪污罪行、自己手面不干净和打虎作战不力的十五个负责干部，分别给以拘捕查办、撤职查办、撤职、停职反省的处分。
    谭震林在讲话中分析了上海市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动对于全国的重要性，并对掌握材料、组织火力、宣传政策的“三宝齐放”战术，和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的意义和政策等问题，作了详尽的说明。
    这次党员干部大会开过后，全市十一路打虎大军立即召开紧急会议，严肃地批判了右倾思想，拟订新的作战计划，发动群众，组织力量，对贪污分子展开了围剿战。至此，战局大变。各路大军捷报频传。财经大队所属上海市零售公司指挥部、上海市合作社联合社都取得了很大胜利。
