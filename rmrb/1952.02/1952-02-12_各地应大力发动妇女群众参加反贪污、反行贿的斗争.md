    Beijing, Tianjin and other places have achieved remarkable results and good experience in mobilizing women to participate in the struggle against corruption and bribery. It is worth noting and imitating in various places, in order to vigorously mobilize women to participate in the struggle and help the struggle against corruption and bribery achieve a complete victory. The number of reports from women in Beijing on corruption, bribery, and tax evasion accounted for a quarter of all reports from citizens; in the 15th section of the Second District, women accounted for two-thirds of the 3,006 reports, and there were major cases of theft of state property worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In Tianjin's Fourth District, at one mass meeting, 24 women reported 96 facts of corruption, bribery, and tax evasion. Facts have proven that women are an important force in the fight against corruption and bribery. However, they had concerns at the beginning of participating in the movement, fearing "offending people" and suffering blows from corrupt and bribe-taking elements. However, as long as they are earnestly mobilized, the great significance of this struggle and the responsibilities of women are explained to them, they are supported, and activists are mobilized to take the lead, and model women against corruption and bribery are promptly commended in the movement, it is possible to mobilize the majority of women and achieve great results. For example, Wei, an old lady in the Third District of Beijing, discovered four or five problems a day by visiting from house to house; Shen Peirong, a woman in the Sixth District, learned that a meat shop had given two catties of meat to a policeman, and after persuasion and education, she mobilized the shop owner to confess to evading 3.5 million yuan in taxes at a symposium, which prompted twelve merchants to confess to bribery and tax evasion at the meeting (including Ruiji Paper Shop, which evaded 40 million yuan in taxes). In addition to mobilizing women to participate in mass meetings of people from all walks of life in the city and district, various places should, under the unified leadership of the Thrift and Inspection Committee, convene mobilization meetings and representative meetings of women from all walks of life by the Democratic Women's Federation, organize various forms of discussions and deliberations, conduct home visits and individual talks, and can also mobilize through women's study groups, spare-time schools, and newspaper reading groups participated in by women.

    Secondly, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing and other places have mobilized the family members of bribe-givers among industrial and commercial households, and individual units have mobilized the family members of corrupt elements, to mobilize their husbands and sons to confess, which has also received good results. For example, Zhang Yuran, a family member of a staff member of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, mobilized her husband to confess to accepting bribes of 9.3 million yuan from unscrupulous merchants three times; Chen Shuping, a housewife in the Fifth District of Tianjin, mobilized nine people to confess to bribery and tax evasion, the first of whom was her husband. The family members of corrupt and bribe-taking elements were initially worried that their husbands or sons would be imprisoned, confiscated of ill-gotten gains, and their future lives would be difficult after confessing. However, as long as they are earnestly explained the policies, and they are educated with typical examples of corrupt and bribe-taking elements who have confessed and who have not confessed, they will actively mobilize their husbands, sons, or fathers to confess in order to seek lenient treatment from the People's Government. If they are not persuaded and educated, some of them will hinder the confession of corrupt and bribe-taking elements. The method of mobilizing the family members of corrupt and bribe-taking elements can be to convene symposiums for family members of staff members of organs and enterprises and symposiums for women in industrial and commercial households, and can also organize forces to conduct in-depth mobilization by visiting from house to house. This experience should also be adopted in various places.

    各地应大力发动妇女群众参加反贪污、反行贿的斗争
    葛叔华
    北京、天津等地在发动妇女群众参加反贪污、反行贿斗争方面，已获得显著成绩和良好经验，值得各地注意仿行，以大力发动妇女群众参加斗争，帮助反贪污、反行贿斗争取得彻底胜利。北京市妇女群众检举贪污、行贿、偷税的件数，占全部市民群众检举件数的四分之一；第二区十五段群众检举的三千零六件内，妇女检举的就占三分之二，而且里面有盗窃国家财产数亿的大案件。天津市第四区在一次群众会上，就有二十四个妇女检举贪污、行贿、偷税事实九十六件。事实证明，妇女群众是反贪污、反行贿斗争的一支重要力量。但是，她们在参加运动之初是有顾虑的，怕“得罪人”，怕遭受贪污、行贿分子的打击。然而，只要认真地向她们动员，说明这个斗争的伟大意义和妇女的责任，给她们撑腰，并发动积极分子带头，并在运动中及时地表扬反贪污、反行贿的模范妇女，是能够把广大妇女发动起来，获得很大成果的。例如北京市第三区魏老太太用串门的方式，一天就发现了四、五个问题；第六区妇女沈佩荣，了解了一家肉铺曾送给警士二斤肉，经过说服教育，动员该铺掌柜在一个座谈会上坦白了漏税三百五十万元的事实，推动了十二户商人在会上坦白了行贿、漏税行为（其中瑞记纸行一户即漏税四千万元）。发动妇女群众的方法，除动员妇女群众参加市、区各界的群众大会外，各地应在节约检查委员会统一领导下，由民主妇女联合会召开各界妇女动员大会、妇女代表会议，组织各种形式的座谈、酝酿，进行家庭访问和个别谈话，并可通过妇女学习小组、业余学校和妇女参加的读报组等进行动员。
    其次，北京、天津、重庆等地曾在工商户中动员行贿分子的家属，个别单位动员贪污分子的家属，来动员她们的丈夫、儿子坦白，也收到很好的效果。如北京市石景山钢铁厂职员家属张玉然，动员丈夫坦白出三次接受奸商贿赂九百三十万元；天津市第五区家庭妇女陈淑萍，一个人动员了九个人坦白行贿、漏税行为，其中第一个就是她的丈夫。贪污、行贿分子的家属，开始是有顾虑的，她们怕丈夫或儿子坦白以后会坐监、倒赃和因此引起今后生活困难。然而只要认真向她们说明政策，并以已处理的坦白和不坦白的贪污、行贿分子的典型例子教育她们，她们就会积极地动员自己的丈夫、儿子或父亲坦白，以求人民政府的宽大处理。如果不向她们进行说服教育工作，她们有的还会阻碍贪污、行贿分子的坦白。动员贪污、行贿分子家属的方法，可以采取召开机关、企业工作人员家属座谈会和工商户妇女座谈会的办法，还可以组织力量，串门进行深入动员。这一经验，各地也应注意采用。
