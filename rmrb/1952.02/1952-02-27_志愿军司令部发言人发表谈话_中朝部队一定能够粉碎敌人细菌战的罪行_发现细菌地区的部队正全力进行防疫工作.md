Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th – Our reporter recently interviewed the spokesperson of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters regarding the large-scale use of bacteriological weapons by the American invading army in Korea and the inhumane conduct of bacteriological warfare. The spokesperson issued the following statement:

The people of the world already know that the American invading army has recently used bacteriological weapons on a large scale on the Korean battlefield. The American aggressors are attempting to use this inhumane and bloody method to achieve their aggressive goals, which they will never be able to achieve. This monstrous crime committed by the U.S. military invading Korea, which blatantly violates international law and human morality, has aroused the boundless anger of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and will surely arouse the resolute condemnation of all peace-loving people in the world.

In the past year or more of the Korean War, the American invading army has used various weapons of mass destruction to slaughter the Chinese and Korean People's armies and the Korean people. However, all these murderous weapons of the American invading army could not defeat the Chinese and Korean People's armies or conquer the Korean people, and they themselves suffered an irreparable defeat. Under these desperate circumstances, they have even more frantically launched a germ warfare.

Long before launching the war of aggression against Korea, the American warmongers secretly prepared for germ warfare in Japan and South Korea, and raised Japanese notorious germ warfare criminal Shiro Ishii and others to actively research and manufacture bacteriological weapons. After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, these germ warfare criminals used our captured personnel for experiments. In December 1950, when the American invading army was retreating south of the 38th parallel under the powerful counterattack of the Chinese and Korean People's armies, they scattered smallpox bacteria in areas such as Kangwon Province, Hwanghae Province, and North Pyongan Province in North Korea, causing many Korean people to suffer tragic poisoning. At present, precisely when the American invading army is continuing to suffer new setbacks on the Korean battlefield, and their negotiating representatives are adhering to absurd and unreasonable demands at the negotiation table, obstructing the rapid achievement of a ceasefire agreement, they are so mad that they disregard the peace aspirations of the people of the world, violate international law and human justice, and openly use bacteriological weapons, attempting to turn the entire Korea into a region rife with disease, and slaughter the heroic Chinese and Korean People's armies and the Korean people who are fighting for independence and freedom. This extremely brutal adventure by the American aggressors is futile and is bound to fail.

The American aggressors will never be able to obtain with extremely brutal germ warfare what they cannot obtain by other means. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, supported by the righteous people of the world, will never be intimidated by this vicious atrocity of the invaders. We have defeated countless conspiracies and tricks of the enemy together with the Korean people in the past, and we will continue to smash the shameful crimes of the enemy's germ warfare in the future. Now our material and technical conditions have been greatly improved, we have a large number of excellent medical personnel and sound medical institutions, and the troops in areas where bacterial insects have been discovered are carrying out large-scale epidemic prevention work, making every effort to eliminate these poisonous insects. We firmly believe that the Chinese and Korean people, who have defeated the Japanese fascist bandits who used bacteriological weapons, will surely defeat the American aggressors who use bacteriological weapons. All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will fight even more heroically and strive unremittingly to defend the security of the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

    志愿军司令部发言人发表谈话
    中朝部队一定能够粉碎敌人细菌战的罪行
    发现细菌地区的部队正全力进行防疫工作
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社记者顷就美国侵略军在朝鲜大规模地使用细菌武器，灭绝人性地进行细菌战争一事，访问中国人民志愿军司令部发言人，承其发表谈话如下：
    全世界人民已经知道最近美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上大规模使用细菌武器。美国侵略者企图用这种灭绝人性的血腥手段来达到他们永远不能达到的侵略目的。侵朝美军这种公然违反国际公法和人类道德的滔天罪行，已经激起中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员的无比愤怒，也必将激起全世界爱好和平人民的坚决声讨。
    在过去一年多的朝鲜战争中，美国侵略军曾使用了各种大规模杀人武器来虐杀朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民。但是美国侵略军的这一切杀人武器都不能战胜朝中人民军队，不能征服朝鲜人民，而他们自己却遭受了不可挽救的失败。在这种穷途末路的情况下，他们竟更疯狂地发动了细菌战争。
    美国战争贩子们远在发动侵朝战争之前，就在日本和南朝鲜秘密地进行了细菌战的准备工作，并豢养了日本著名细菌战犯石井四郎等人积极研究和制造细菌武器。侵朝战争发起后，这些细菌战犯就利用我军被俘人员进行试验。一九五零年十二月，美国侵略军在朝中人民军队强大反攻下向三八线以南溃逃时，他们曾在北朝鲜的江原道、黄海道、平安北道等地区撒布了天花细菌，致使许多朝鲜人民惨遭毒害。目前，正当美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上继续遭受新的挫败，他们的谈判代表在谈判会议桌上坚持荒谬无理的要求，阻挠停战谈判迅速达成协议的时候，他们竟丧心病狂到不顾世界人民的和平愿望、违反国际公法和人类正义，公然使用起细菌武器，企图把全朝鲜变成疠疫横行的地区，虐杀英勇的朝中人民军队和为独立和自由而战的朝鲜人民。美国侵略者的这种极端残暴的冒险是徒劳的，是一定要失败的。
    美国侵略者用其他方法所不能得到的东西，用极端残暴的细菌战也是绝不能得到的。有着全世界正义人民支援的中国人民志愿军是绝不会被侵略者的这种毒辣暴行所吓倒的。我们过去曾与朝鲜人民一道粉碎过敌人的无数阴谋诡计，今后仍将继续粉碎敌人细菌战的可耻罪行。现在我们的物质和技术条件都有了很大改善，我们有着大批优秀的医务人员和健全的医疗机构，目前发现细菌昆虫地区的部队正进行大规模的防疫工作，全力扑灭这些毒虫。我们坚信，曾经打败过使用细菌武器的日本法西斯匪徒的中朝人民，一定能够打败使用细菌武器的美国侵略者。中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员和战斗员们将更加英勇作战，为保卫祖国安全、保卫远东与世界和平而奋斗不懈！
