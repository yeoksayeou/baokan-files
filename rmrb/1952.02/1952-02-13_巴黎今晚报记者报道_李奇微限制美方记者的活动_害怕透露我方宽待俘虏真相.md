Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: Paris "Tonight" reporter, Béquet, reported from Panmunjom on the 10th: After suffering the biggest failure in a series of propaganda defeats, Ridgway had to carry out an even clumsier propaganda campaign, namely his recent order prohibiting UN reporters from "fraternizing" with "Communist reporters." After American newspapers and news agencies published photos last week proving that the prisoners in the POW camps in North Korea all looked healthy and happy, Ridgway's fabricated slanderous accusations of maltreatment of Allied POWs completely went bankrupt. Even the US military's "Stars and Stripes" published these pictures. In particular, these newspapers published a two-page spread of photos of General Dean's life. All these pictures completely exposed Ridgway's fabricated lies about abusing prisoners of war. Therefore, Ridgway's headquarters immediately became furious about "private contacts," citing the publications that published photos taken in prisoner-of-war camps as examples, and inexplicably linked this matter to endangering "military security" and "progress in negotiations." American reporters and news agencies do not understand why the families of prisoners of war would feel the human touch of seeing pictures of their fat, happy sons and husbands in the newspapers, which would endanger the above two things. These families or editors don't understand either. We can only see that this matter endangers Ridgway's propaganda and the propagandists who defend the mistakes they have made. The great human emotional appeal of these pictures and their impact on those families are unbearable for Ridgway. In any case, this is not the first time that UN reporters have asked the Korean-Chinese side reporters for the real facts. Nor is it the first time that Ridgway has tried every means to prevent them from doing so. And these two situations will not be the last. The reporters who accompany the interviews on negotiation news naturally prefer to obtain news from their own side, but from the first few days of the negotiations, the indecent reports made by the American press officer, Nacos, made it impossible for the reporters to do so. An American reporter satirized Nacos's recent ridiculous appearance, saying: "He might be a good publicist for a third-rate musical comedy troupe." In recent days, American reporters have almost without exception condemned the "high-pressure tactics" used by Ridgway to create his recent mistake. We only need to understand that he and the press officer have only been concerned with how to prevent people from knowing the truth since the beginning of the negotiations to understand the incredible mistakes he has made. Their job is to cover it up immediately before the truth begins to emerge.

    巴黎今晚报记者报道
    李奇微限制美方记者的活动
    害怕透露我方宽待俘虏真相
    【新华社十二日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌十日自板门店报道：李奇微遭受到一系列宣传败绩中的最大一次失败之后，不得不进行一个更加笨拙的宣传，那就是他最近禁止联合国记者“交结”“共产党记者”的命令。上周美国报纸和通讯社发布了证明在朝鲜北部俘虏营的俘虏个个都显得健康愉快的照片之后，李奇微所捏造的所谓对联军战俘施以暴行的诽谤指控便彻底破产了。甚至美军的“星条报”也登了这些图片。尤其是这些报纸曾以两页篇幅登出了迪安将军生活的照片。所有这些图片都彻底揭穿了李奇微捏造的所谓虐待战俘的谎话。因此，李奇微总部立即对于“私下交往”大发雷霆，并引刊载在战俘营拍摄的照片的刊物为例，而且还莫名其妙地把这事和危害“军事安全”与“谈判进展”联系在一起。美国记者和通讯社不知道为什么战俘的家庭在报上看到他们胖胖的、快乐的儿子和丈夫的照片因而感到的人情的慰藉会危害上述两件事情。这些家庭或编辑们也不明白。我们只能看出：这事危害了李奇微的宣传以及为他们所造成的大错而辩护的宣传家。这些图片所具有的巨大的人情感召力，以及它们对于那些家庭的影响，都不是李奇微所能忍受的。无论如何，联合国记者向朝中方面记者要求真正的事实这不是第一次。李奇微千方百计地阻止他们这样做也不是第一次。而且这两种情形也不会是最后的一次。采访谈判消息的随行记者自然宁愿从自己的一方取得消息，但从开头几天的谈判起，美方新闻发布官纳科斯所作的毫不像样的汇报，就使记者们做不到这一点。一位美国记者曾讽刺纳科斯最近的可笑的样子说：“他可能做一个第三流音乐喜剧班的好宣传员。”最近几天以来，美国记者差不多毫无例外地谴责李奇微造成他最近这次错误时所用的“高压手段”。我们只需了解他和新闻发布官自谈判开始以来就只关心如何不让人知道真相，就会懂得他所造成的令人难以相信的大错了。他们的工作就是在真相还没有开始显露之前，立即把它蒙住。
