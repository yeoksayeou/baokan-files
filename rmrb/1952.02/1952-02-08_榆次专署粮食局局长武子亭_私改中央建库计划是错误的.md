To the Editor:

Wu Ziting, Director of the Yuci Prefectural Grain Bureau in Shanxi Province, privately altered the central government's grain storage construction plan, causing serious damage to state property. The construction of the Shouyang Grain Depot was led by the Yuci Prefectural Grain Bureau. The central government originally allocated 410 million yuan to build a steel-reinforced concrete (brick foundation) warehouse capable of storing 3.5 million jin of grain. However, Wu Ziting did not follow the plan. Instead, he used the funds for one warehouse to build two. So far, 369 million yuan has been spent, and only one and a half warehouses have been built. The foundation walls were constructed using adobe in the middle, and adobe was also used on the roof. Because steel-reinforced concrete was not used for the roof, the surface has frozen and cracked, with two large gaps at the top, which may collapse within a few years. To rebuild the roof, it would cost at least 250 million yuan. In addition, the adobe used for the walls was not dry, causing the stored grain to generate heat. It is estimated that it will be difficult to dry thoroughly within a year. Therefore, I suggest that Wu Ziting, Director of the Yuci Prefectural Grain Bureau, should not only find a way to remedy this project quickly but also make a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

    榆次专署粮食局局长武子亭
    私改中央建库计划是错误的
    编辑同志：山西省榆次专署粮食局局长武子亭私改中央建库计划，使国家财产遭到严重的损失。寿阳分粮库的建库工程，是由榆次专署粮食局领导的。中央原计划拨款四亿一千万元，建筑一个钢骨水泥（墙基用砖）仓库，可容纳粮食三百五十万斤。但武子亭不按计划办事，竟把一个库的款子，建两个库，现在已花了三亿六千九百万元，只建了一个半库。墙基中间放土坯，在库顶上也用土坯。库顶因没有用钢骨水泥，浮面已冻裂，顶处豁开两条大缝，很可能在几年内倒塌。如果要再建一个库顶，至少需款两亿五千万元。另外，砌墙的土坯不干，致使存放的粮食发生了热气。据估计在一年内很难干透。因此，我建议：榆次专署粮食局局长武子亭除了对这一工程迅速想法补救外，并应在报上作公开检讨。  刘培健
