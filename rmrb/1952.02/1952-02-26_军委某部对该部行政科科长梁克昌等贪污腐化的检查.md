Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:
    Regarding the letter from Comrade Qie Baohua published in the People's Daily on January 9, 1952, exposing "Liang Kechang, head of the Administration Section of a certain department of the Military Commission, and his deputy, Zhong Yuntang, for corruption and decadence," we immediately conducted an inspection of this issue.

    We are still investigating the matter mentioned in the letter regarding Liang Kechang's arbitrary extravagance during a business trip to Shanghai. The errors concerning the creation of false receipts and the blind trust in Liu Dianjue (a Kuomintang member), a former soldier, which resulted in Liu's embezzlement and escape, occurred in the first half of 1950. Multiple meetings were held in July and August of 1950 to criticize and struggle against Liang. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, Liang was again severely criticized. However, Liang Kechang repeatedly refused to confess to his errors of corruption and bribery and has been removed from his position.

    The errors committed by Zhong Yuntang are also serious. He was able to thoroughly confess during the campaign and guaranteed that he would never repeat his mistakes. He has been given a reduced punishment and ordered to engage in deeper self-reflection.

    Comrade Qie's statement that "Liang Kechang, Zhong Yuntang, and others embezzled 1.5 billion yuan of public funds for personal gain" is slightly different from the facts. The funds were proposed to be diverted by Liang Kechang and approved by the director of the unit's office to be deposited in the Central Government Direct Affiliated Organs Construction Office to generate interest and attempt to use the interest to subsidize the organs' expenses. This is a violation of financial regulations. The director has made a self-criticism regarding this matter and has submitted all 1.5 billion yuan of public funds and 120 million yuan of interest to the higher authorities, and has requested punishment.

    Regarding Comrade Qie's statement that Liang and others re-claimed expenses for photographic equipment purchased from the Northeast, the investigation revealed that, in addition to submitting formal receipts for reimbursement, the notes written were for record-keeping purposes only and there was no double-claiming of expenses.

### 军委某部对该部行政科科长梁克昌等贪污腐化的检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    军委某部对该部行政科科长梁克昌等贪污腐化的检查
    编辑同志：一九五二年一月九日人民日报登载了郄宝华同志揭露“军委某部行政科正副科长梁克昌、钟运堂贪污腐化”的来信，我们马上对这一问题进行了检查。
    信中所说梁克昌出差到上海任意挥霍一节，我们还在调查。关于造假单据及盲目信任旧军人刘殿爵
    （国民党员）以致刘犯拐款潜逃等错误，是在一九五零年上半年发生的，在一九五零年七、八月，已开过多次会议，对梁进行过批评和斗争；在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动大会上，又对梁进行了严厉的批评。但梁克昌对贪污受贿等错误，一再拒不坦白，已予撤职处分。
    钟运堂所犯的错误也是严重的。他在运动中尚能彻底坦白，并保证以后决不重犯，已减轻处分，令其再作深入反省。
    郄同志所提“梁克昌、钟运堂挪用公款十五亿元营私谋利”一节，与事实稍有出入。该款系梁克昌提议挪用，经本单位办公室主任批准，存入中央直属机关修建处生息，并企图用息钱补助机关开支。这是违犯财政制度的。该主任对此事已作检讨，将公款十五亿元及利息一亿二千万元悉数缴送上级，并自请处分。
    郄同志所提，梁等从东北买来照相器材重领款项一事，经检查结果，证明梁等除将正式单据报销外，所写纸条，系作存底用的，并无向上重领款项情事。    军委某部节约检查委员会
