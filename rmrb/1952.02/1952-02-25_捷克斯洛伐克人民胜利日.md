    Czechoslovak People's Victory Day
    Today is the fourth anniversary of the Czechoslovak People's Victory Day. The Czechoslovak people are commemorating this important festival with the new achievements they have made in peaceful construction.
    On February 19, 1948, twelve ministers representing the reactionary parties of Czechoslovakia, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, simultaneously submitted their resignations to the then President of Czechoslovakia, Beneš. They vainly attempted to create a serious political crisis by this means in order to exclude the Czechoslovak Communist Party and form a purely reactionary government, and then unscrupulously sell Czechoslovakia to U.S. imperialism. However, the imperialists and their running dogs in Czechoslovakia—the reactionary elements of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie—completely underestimated the strength of the Czech Communist Party and the working people, and their despicable conspiracy to restore capitalism in Czechoslovakia immediately suffered a shameful defeat. Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, headed by Gottwald, the Czechoslovak people finally forced Beneš to accept the resignations of all the reactionary ministers, and on February 25, completely removed them from the government. In this fierce class struggle, the Czechoslovak people achieved a complete victory, so the Czechoslovak people designated this day as their Victory Day.
    After smashing the U.S. imperialist-instigated treasonous conspiracy of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, the Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, smoothly embarked on the road of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    After restoring the national economy destroyed by World War II, Czechoslovakia implemented its first five-year economic plan starting in 1949. After the completion of the first year of the five-year plan, Czechoslovakia's industrial production had increased by 27.9 percent compared to 1947, greatly exceeding the pre-war level. In 1950, heavy industrial production increased by another 15.4 percent compared to 1949.
    The results of the implementation of the economic plans in 1949 and 1950 showed that Czechoslovakia's industrial potential had much more to be tapped. Therefore, the Czechoslovak government revised and expanded the original five-year plan last year, adding production tasks for the three years from 1951 to 1953. The original target for industrial production to increase by 47 percent by 1953 compared to 1948 has now been raised to 100 percent.
    1951 was a year in which the Czechoslovak people continued to make significant achievements in building socialism. In this year, 99.7 percent of the expanded production plan was completed. Among them, the industries of brown coal, iron ore, steel, rayon, and truck manufacturing have reached or approached the level of 1953. Compared with 1950, industrial production increased by 14.9 percent, of which heavy industry output increased by an average of 22.9 percent, and light industry output increased by an average of 10.6 percent. One of the major events in industrial construction in 1951 was the establishment of a huge metallurgical plant named after Gottwald in the Končice area. Under the assault of the workers, this metallurgical plant was completed by the end of last year and started producing iron on January 1 this year. In order to complete the steel production tasks stipulated in the five-year plan, another huge joint metallurgical plant is also under active construction. Soon after, Czechoslovakia, with a population of only 12 million, will rank sixth in the world in steel production.
    Czechoslovakia is a country lacking food, so developing agriculture has become a very important task.
    Agricultural production in 1951 increased by 6 percent compared to 1950, and the cultivated area expanded by 5 percent. Now, Czechoslovak agriculture is gradually moving towards collectivization through the form of agricultural cooperatives. In 1951, more than 1,000 new unified agricultural cooperatives were established, bringing the number of agricultural cooperatives to 7,573. The cultivated land of state-owned farms accounts for more than a quarter of the country's cultivated land, and the number of tractors in state-owned machine tractor stations has increased by 23 percent compared to 1950.
    Due to the development of economic construction, the people's living standards are improving day by day. Workers' wages have increased by 80 percent compared to 1946, and the salaries of staff and employees have increased by nearly 50 percent. In 1951, meat consumption reached 39 kilograms per person per year, while in 1936 it was only a little more than 26 kilograms. Butter consumption increased by 23 percent, textiles increased by 16 percent, and shoe sales increased by 12 percent.
    The facts of the past four years have fully proved that only the road of peace, democracy, and socialism is the road to happiness and freedom for the Czechoslovak people. Now, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President Gottwald, and with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak people are building their beautiful lives with full confidence, and are using their new achievements in construction to strengthen the forces of the world peace and democracy camp.

    捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利日
    今天是捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利日的四周年。捷克斯洛伐克人民以他们在和平建设中所获得的新的成就，来纪念这一个重要的节日。
    一九四八年二月十九日，代表捷克斯洛伐克反动党派的十二个部长，在美帝国主义的指使之下，同时向当时的捷克总统贝奈斯提出辞职。他们妄图藉此造成严重的政治危机，以便排除捷克斯洛伐克共产党而组成清一色的反动政府，然后肆无忌惮地把捷克斯洛伐克出卖给美帝国主义。但是，帝国主义及其在捷克斯洛伐克的走狗——大地主、大资产阶级的反动分子，完全低估了捷克共产党及劳动人民的力量，他们企图使资本主义在捷克斯洛伐克复辟的卑劣阴谋，立刻遭受了可耻的失败。在以哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导之下，捷克斯洛伐克人民终于迫使贝奈斯接受了全体反动部长们的辞呈，而在二月二十五日，把他们从政府中完全清除出去。在这一场激烈的阶级斗争中，捷克斯洛伐克人民取得了完全的胜利，因此捷克斯洛伐克人民就把这一天定为自己的胜利日。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民粉碎了美帝国主义策动的大地主大资产阶级的叛国阴谋之后，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，顺利地走上了和平、民主与社会主义的道路。
    在恢复了被第二次世界大战所破坏的国民经济以后，捷克斯洛伐克从一九四九年起，实行了第一个五年经济计划。五年计划第一年的计划完成以后，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产量已较一九四七年增加了百分之二十七点九，大大地超出了战前的水平，一九五○年的重工业生产量与一九四九年相较，又增加了百分之十五点四。
    一九四九年与一九五○年经济计划执行的结果，显示了捷克斯洛伐克的工业潜力，还有许多可以发挥，因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府又在去年修改和扩大了原来的五年计划，增加了一九五一年至一九五三年的三年中的生产任务。原定工业生产量至一九五三年时较一九四八年增加百分之四十七，现已提高到百分之一百。
    一九五一年是捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设社会主义事业中继续获得重大成就的一年。在这一年中，完成了已经扩大了的生产计划的百分之九十九点七，其中褐煤、铁矿、钢、人造纤维、卡车制造等工业，已达到了或接近了一九五三年的水平，与一九五○年相比，工业生产量增加了百分之十四点九，其中重工业产量平均增加了百分之二十二点九，轻工业产量平均增加了百分之十点六。一九五一年工业建设中的重大事件之一，是在康其澈地方建立的以哥特瓦尔德为名的巨大冶炼厂。在工人的突击之下，这个冶炼厂已在去年年底全部完工，并自今年一月一日起开始产铁。为了完成五年计划所规定的钢产任务，另一座巨型的联合冶炼厂，也在积极建设中。不久以后，人口仅有一千二百万的捷克斯洛伐克的钢铁生产量就将占全世界第六位。
    捷克斯洛伐克是缺乏粮食的国家，因此，发展农业就成为很重要的任务。
    一九五一年的农业生产量较一九五○年增加了百分之六，耕地面积扩大了百分之五。现在，捷克斯洛伐克的农业正在通过农业合作社的形式，逐步地走向集体化。一九五一年内，共建立了一千多个新的统一农业合作社，因而使农业合作社的数目增加至七千五百七十三个。国营农场的耕地已占全国耕地的四分之一以上，国营机器拖拉机站的拖拉机数量较一九五○年增加了百分之二十三。
    由于经济建设的发展，人民的生活水平正在日益提高。工人的工资比一九四六年增加了百分之八十，职员与雇员的薪金增加了近百分之五十。在一九五一年肉类消费量每人每年已达三十九公斤，而在一九三六年则仅二十六公斤多一点。牛油的消费量增加了百分之二十三，纺织品增加了百分之十六，皮鞋的销售量增加了百分之十二。
    四年来的事实，完全证明了只有和平、民主与社会主义的道路，才是捷克斯洛伐克人民幸福与自由的道路。现在，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和哥特瓦尔德总统的领导之下，在苏联的友谊帮助之下，捷克斯洛伐克人民正在满怀信心地建设着他们美好的生活，并用自己在建设中获得的新成就，来加强世界和平民主阵营的力量。
