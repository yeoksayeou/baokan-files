Severely Punish Unscrupulous Merchants Who Murder Shop Employees
    Zhejiang Provincial Court Sentences Unscrupulous Merchant Zhang Changgen to Death
    Unscrupulous Merchant Min Shaoyun of Nanchang City Arrested for Driving Shop Employee to Death

On January 25, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Court held a mass sentencing rally and sentenced Zhang Changgen, an unscrupulous merchant from Hangzhou City who killed worker Chen Lianzhong, to death on the spot. Xu Zhengyou, an unscrupulous merchant who forced female employee Fang Wenbin to death, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.

Zhang Changgen was the owner of Zhang Changgen Scissors Workshop in Hangzhou City. He consistently used feudal methods to oppress workers, using illegal means such as prohibiting reading newspapers, increasing working hours (more than 16 hours a day), not issuing "monthly regulations," and forbidding going out to prevent workers from participating in political activities. Chen Lianzhong, a worker at Zhang Changgen Scissors Workshop, served as the organization committee member of the Shangcheng District Working Committee of the trade union. He was enthusiastic about trade union work, often led workers and apprentices in the workshop to participate in trade union activities, and actively opposed the illegal acts of the capitalists in mistreating workers. He also reported the crime of the capitalists harboring a suspicious person who had not registered their household for two years. Since the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Hangzhou City, Chen Lianzhong had become an activist in the movement. Zhang Changgen had long regarded Chen Lianzhong as a thorn in his side, constantly seeking opportunities for revenge. He had attempted to fire Chen Lianzhong but failed. At around 10:00 PM on January 10, after Chen Lianzhong returned from a mobilization meeting for the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle convened by the trade union, Zhang Changgen used a hammer to kill Chen Lianzhong while he was asleep, and then fled. He was eventually arrested and brought to justice.

Xu Zhengyou was the owner of the Hai Taixie Cloth Factory in Hangzhou City. Fang Wenbin, the female accountant of this factory, came from a poor family and had always been active in her work. During the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, Xu Zhengyou attempted to lure Fang Wenbin into helping him evade taxes. However, Fang Wenbin firmly stood her ground, not only sternly rejecting his enticements but also repeatedly reporting his illegal acts to the government. Xu Zhengyou harbored resentment for this and designed to persecute her by withholding her salary, causing her entire family to go hungry for three days. Suffering from this blow, Fang Wenbin was in great mental distress and was forced to hang herself on January 17.

The crimes of Zhang and Xu in persecuting employees and sabotaging the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence aroused public indignation in Hangzhou City. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Court severely punished the two criminals in accordance with the law.

Min Shaoyun, the manager of Yuan Dahe South Goods Store on Shengli Road in Nanchang City, is a vicious and cunning unscrupulous merchant. Since the liberation of Nanchang City in 1949, he has been engaged in illegal activities. He made false accounts, evaded national taxes, and even took money from the daily cash income of the store to buy gold and silver dollars. Chen Zhicheng, a shop employee, had raised objections to Min Shaoyun's illegal activities. Min Shaoyun used various shameless means to attack Chen Zhicheng, inviting Chen Zhicheng to see operas and eat in restaurants. Chen Zhicheng could not resist the "corruption" of the bourgeoisie and finally became his prisoner. From then on, Min Shaoyun frequently directed Chen Zhicheng to embezzle enterprise funds and evade national taxes for him. According to incomplete statistics, Min Shaoyun has evaded funds amounting to more than 5,300 silver dollars and more than ten taels of gold. The turnover of evaded taxes is more than 400 million yuan.

Last year, the tax bureau found false accounts in the store. Chen Zhicheng was therefore summoned to the warehouse by Min Shaoyun for severe reprimands. After that, Min Shaoyun secretly blackmailed and oppressed Chen Zhicheng. After this movement began, Yuan Dahe's problems were also exposed by the masses. Min Shaoyun did not confess his crimes but instead pushed all the responsibility onto Chen Zhicheng. Min Shaoyun returned to the store and suppressed Chen Zhicheng, not allowing him to admit it, and threatening him by saying, "If you admit it, you will be punished by the government." Chen Zhicheng could not bear Min Shaoyun's coercion and hanged himself at around 3:00 AM on January 24. The Nanchang City People's Court has arrested Min Shaoyun and will severely punish him according to law.

    严厉惩办杀害店员工人的不法商人
    浙江省法院判处奸商张长根死刑
    南昌市奸商闵少云逼死店员已被逮捕
    浙江省人民法院在一月二十五日召开群众性的宣判大会，当场判处杭州市杀死工人陈连仲的不法商人张长根以死刑，判处逼死女职员方文彬的不法商人徐正友以死刑，缓期两年执行。
    张长根是杭州市张长根剪刀作坊的店主，一贯用封建手段压迫工人，并用禁止阅读书报、增加工作时间（每日工作十六小时以上）、不发“月规”、不许外出等非法手段，阻止工人参加政治活动。张长根剪刀作坊工人陈连仲，担任工会上城区工作委员会组织委员，热心工会工作，经常带领作坊内工人、学徒参加工会活动，积极反对资方虐待工人的不法行为。他并曾检举资方窝藏二年不报户口的可疑分子的罪行。杭州市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以来，陈连仲成了运动中的活动分子。张长根老早就把陈连仲看作眼中钉，时时伺机图谋报复。他曾企图解雇陈连仲，因故未逞。一月十日晚十时左右，陈连仲参加工会召集的反贪污、反行贿斗争动员会回来，入睡以后，张长根竟用铁锤把陈连仲打死，然后潜逃。后终被拘捕归案。
    徐正友是杭州市海泰协布厂的老板。这个厂的女会计方文彬，家境贫苦，工作一贯积极。在反行贿、反偷税运动中，徐正友曾经企图诱惑方文彬，帮助他进行逃税活动。但方文彬坚守立场，不但严词拒绝他的引诱，并一再向政府检举他的不法行为。徐正友为此怀恨在心，竟设计迫害，扣发工资，致使方文彬全家挨饿三天。方文彬受到这种打击，精神十分痛苦，在一月十七日被迫自缢身死。
    张、徐两犯迫害职工，破坏反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，激起杭州市各界人民的公愤。浙江省人民法院依法给两犯以严厉制裁。
    南昌市胜利路元大和南货号经理闵少云，是一个狠毒狡猾的奸商。一九四九年南昌市解放后，他一直进行不法活动。他造假账，偷漏国税，还每日由门市收入的现钞内，抽出钱去买黄金、现洋。店员陈志成对闵少云的这些不法行为，曾提出意见。闵少云竟用各种无耻的手段，向陈志成进攻，请陈志成看戏、吃馆子。陈志成经不起资产阶级的“腐蚀”，终于做了他的俘虏。从此，闵少云经常指挥陈志成替他抽空企业资金，偷漏国税。据不完全统计，闵少云已逃避资金达现洋五千三百余元，黄金十余两。逃避税收的营业额有四亿元以上。
    去年该号曾被税务局查出假账。陈志成因此被闵少云喊到栈房里去严厉责难。此后，闵少云就暗地里对陈志成进行要挟、压迫。这次运动开始后，元大和的问题也被群众揭发了。闵少云不坦白自己的罪恶，反将一切责任都推在陈志成身上。闵少云回到店里又压制陈志成，不准承认，而且恐吓说：“你承认了，就该受政府的处分”。陈志成受不了闵少云的逼迫，在一月二十四日晨三时许自缢而死。现南昌市人民法院已将闵少云逮捕，将依法严惩。
