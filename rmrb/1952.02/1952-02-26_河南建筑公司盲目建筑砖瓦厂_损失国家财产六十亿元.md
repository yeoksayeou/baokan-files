    Henan Construction Company Blindly Builds Brick Factory
    Losses of National Property Amount to 6 Billion Yuan
    Editor: The Henan Construction Company built a brick factory in Xiaoyi County, Shanxi Province, spending 9.5 billion yuan. Of this huge amount spent by the company, only 140 million yuan was used for directly producing brick kilns. The rest was spent on six buildings. At least three of these six buildings are unnecessary. As far as I know, the reason the company did this was to spend all of the funds approved for the previous year, otherwise the money would have to be returned to the national treasury. Now, the brick kiln has added production tools such as tile supports and tile frames, but there are no funds left. The construction of this brick factory was also very wasteful: some floor slabs have cracks of one or two inches between each piece; the quality of the tiles is also poor. The company transported 9,000 extra pieces of wood from Zhengzhou, and now it has to transport them back to Zhengzhou. Because the company had no plan for this project, it is estimated that the loss to the people's property will be 6 billion yuan.

    河南建筑公司盲目建筑砖瓦厂
    损失国家财产六十亿元
    编辑同志：河南省建筑公司在山西省孝义县造了一座砖瓦厂，花了九十五亿元。该公司花费的如此巨大的款项中，只有一亿四千万元，用在直接生产的砖瓦窑上，其他款项，都用在六幢建筑物上。这六幢建筑物至少有三幢是不需要的。该公司所以这样作，据我所知，是为了把去年度所核准的款都要用去，否则这些钱要退还国库。现在，砖瓦窑添制生产工具瓦托瓦架等，但已无经费了。建筑这座砖瓦厂浪费也很大：有的楼板，每块间有一二吋的裂缝；瓦的质料也是低劣的。公司由郑州多运木料九千根，现在又要运回郑州。由于该公司对这次工程没有计划，估计要损失人民财产六十亿元。
