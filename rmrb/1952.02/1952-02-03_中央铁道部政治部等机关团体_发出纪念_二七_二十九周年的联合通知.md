The Political Department of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, and the National Railway Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly issued a notice on January 25 regarding the commemoration of the 29th anniversary of the "February 7th" Strike. The notice stated: This year's "February 7th" coincides with the nationwide, vigorous, and swift unfolding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. Therefore, commemorating the 29th anniversary of "February 7th" must educate all railway employees to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of "February 7th," enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call, and more broadly and deeply carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, so as to consolidate and purify the Party, the trade union, the Youth League organizations, and the ranks of the working class, continue to develop the railway transportation cause, and implement Chairman Mao's policy of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Increasing Production, Practicing Economy, and Preparing for Large-Scale Economic Construction." The notice pointed out: The commemoration of "February 7th" should focus on mobilizing a deep-going struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and strengthening the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. Combined with the work situation of the unit and the ideological situation of the employees, explain the great significance of this struggle for vigorously increasing production and practicing economy and striving for victory in resisting America and aiding Korea. Mobilize all railway employees to take active action, fully expose the serious corruption, waste, and bureaucracy existing in the railway system, fully expose the serious harm of the bourgeoisie's bad thoughts and behaviors to the Communist Party and the working class, eliminate all incorrigible corrupt elements, and enable every employee to ideologically draw a clear class line and resolutely defeat the bourgeoisie's reactionary thoughts and behaviors that have been rampant against us for the past two or three years, consolidate and strengthen the working class's leading position in the people's democratic dictatorship, and effectively implement the increase of production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.
