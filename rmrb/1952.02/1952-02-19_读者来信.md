Reader's Letters

    From the fact that the traitorous merchant Li Yinting harmed the Volunteer Army,
    We recognize the rampancy of the bourgeoisie's attack

    Editor: The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting bravely on the battlefield, risking their lives and fighting the enemy heroically to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. However, when they were wounded and receiving treatment, they encountered the sharp knife extended by the traitorous merchant Li Yinting on behalf of American imperialism—first-aid kits made of rotten cotton wadding containing festering bacteria. Such a crime by Li Yinting is intolerable to all patriotic people and peace-loving people. We demand that the government quickly give the traitorous merchant Li Yinting the most severe punishment to vent the hatred of the people of the whole country.

    From this incident, we have learned a painful lesson: unscrupulous capitalists are profit-seeking, and the losses they cause to the motherland, the people, and our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—are irreparable. They hate the people of the motherland and hate the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are fighting for the motherland and for human peace. We should more clearly recognize the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie on the proletariat and its serious harm from this fact; we should unite more closely to fully repel the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie, and never stop until we win complete victory.

    Wang Zhishan and others from a certain unit of the People's Air Force suggest
    Sentencing the big traitorous merchant Li Yinting for treason

    Editor: The heinous crime of the traitorous merchant Li Yinting harming the Volunteer Army has aroused our boundless anger and hatred. In order to support the Volunteer Army who are fighting heroically on the front lines in Korea, and to avenge the Volunteer Army comrades who "sacrificed when they shouldn't have," we resolutely demand that the Wuhan Municipal People's Government convict the big traitorous merchant Li Yinting of treason and give him the most severe punishment.

    Avenge the Volunteer Army wounded and sick who were harmed

    Editor: The evil behavior of the traitorous merchant Li Yinting harming the Volunteer Army, and the patriotic behavior of our people across the country saving every bit to support our Volunteer Army with hundreds or thousands of yuan, is such a clear contrast! The traitorous merchants are truly a group of inhuman traitors to the people of the motherland.

    This incident has made us more deeply and concretely understand the nature of the bourgeoisie's pursuit of profit, and also shows that these traitorous merchants are the deadly enemies of our people across the country. I am an ordinary soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and like the people across the country, I cannot tolerate these heinous traitorous merchants. I demand that the government severely punish Li Yinting and the traitorous merchants who have committed the same crimes, to avenge those Volunteer Army wounded and sick who were harmed, crippled, or sacrificed!

    Liu Guizhu, a worker at the Luoyang Packing Plant in Henan,
    Demands severe punishment for Li Yinting, a henchman of American imperialism

    Editor: After reading the news of the traitorous merchant Li Yinting harming the Volunteer Army, we felt 120,000 points of anger!

    The shameless traitorous merchant Li Yinting is only interested in profit, and disregards the safety of the people of the motherland and harms the lives of the Volunteer Army. What difference is there between this and American imperialism directly invading and killing us? Can we stand by and watch this rampant attack of the bourgeoisie? Let us issue the most resolute call: thoroughly destroy the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie and severely punish Li Yinting, an accomplice of American imperialism!

    All students of Peking University
    Resolutely support Regiment Commander Li Xuesan's accusation against the traitorous merchants on behalf of the Volunteer Army

    Editor: All the students of Peking University feel great hatred and anger when we see the heinous crimes of unscrupulous traitorous merchants harming the Volunteer Army revealed in various places. The ferocious faces of the traitorous merchants have been nakedly exposed in front of the people of the whole country. The most outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland—the heroic Volunteer Army troops—are protecting the peace and security of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world with their blood and heads, while these traitorous merchants are doing outrageous and beastly deeds behind their backs. This is absolutely intolerable to every patriotic Chinese person. All the students of Peking University resolutely support Regiment Commander Li Xuesan's accusation against the traitorous merchants on behalf of the Volunteer Army. We demand that the government publicly try these inhuman criminals and give them the most severe legal sanctions, and completely and thoroughly remove this group of bloodsuckers from the ranks of the Chinese people!

    Liu Di, Secretary of the Yangliuqing Town Committee of the CPC, should be punished for corruption and bribery
    Liu Di, Secretary of the Yangliuqing Town Committee and Mayor of the Town of the CPC in Hebei Province, violated national laws and Party discipline by encroaching on farmers' land, using a large amount of relief grain and local grain to invest in organ production, and blatantly evading national taxes, causing serious losses to state assets.

    In the spring of 1950, the disaster situation in the Tianjin Special Zone was very serious, but Liu Di used 26,500 catties of relief grain to invest in organ production. Liu Di also illegally used municipal construction fees, health service fees, etc., totaling 124,000 catties of grain, and used public funds (fines) of 100 million yuan to set up oil mills, flour mills, and clothing bureaus. He occupied more than 200 mu of farmers' land to open three brick factories, and threatened the farmers, saying, "Whoever does not hand over land is not resisting America and aiding Korea!"

    For personal enjoyment, Liu Di once supported Chang Jian, the director of the Taxation Bureau, in stealing 15 million yuan in national taxes. In 1951, five production units in Yangliuqing Town stole more than 96 million yuan in national taxes. Liu Di often ate and drank lavishly. According to preliminary figures, he personally embezzled 8 million yuan. Under the influence of his hedonistic ideas, the Yangliuqing Town Committee organs alone squandered more than 80 million yuan in 1951, and all the organs in the town squandered a total of more than 110 million yuan.

    In addition, Liu Di once accepted a bribe of 3.5 million yuan from Zhang Zishan. In order to conceal his crimes, he pretended to be active and opposed Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. He once bribed Dong Songzhi, the secretary of the Town Committee of the CPC, with 700,000 yuan, asking Dong to help him alter the accounts, but Dong refused. He stipulated that all departments were not allowed to make separate reports on anti-corruption work, but should be reported uniformly by the Town Committee. He has not confessed these behaviors in his self-criticism. Therefore, the Tianjin Prefectural Committee has been kept in the dark about Liu Di's crimes to this day.

    I believe that Liu Di's illegal and disciplined behavior of stealing state assets has caused incalculable losses to state property and seriously damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. I suggest that the Party and government leading organs give Liu Di the sanctions of Party discipline and national law.
    Zhang Zeng, Tianjin Special Branch of the People's Procuratorate of Hebei Province

    Editor's note: The errors of Liu Di, Secretary of the Yangliuqing Town Committee of the CPC, revealed in the letter from Zhang Zeng of the Tianjin Special Branch of the People's Procuratorate of Hebei Province are very serious. We believe that the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the CPC should send people to conduct a thorough investigation, handle this matter seriously in accordance with the principles of the Party, and publish the results in the newspaper.

    Serious corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the Suichuan County People's Bank of Jiangxi Province
    Relevant departments should thoroughly check the work of the bank

    Editor: The corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the Suichuan County People's Bank of Jiangxi Province are very serious. Several cadres of the bank also do business. For example, Zhou Jinsan sells wool; Secretary Zhou Zuoying sells cloth, and even sells silver dollars and lends money at usurious rates; Huang Chengqing, head of the business section, once bought 300 dan of grain to sell in Nanchang. Almost all cadres above the section chief of the bank have eaten in private shops. The president of the bank also has the behavior of borrowing money in his own name to do business. Last year, during the land reform, the local people took the fruits of the struggle they had obtained—gold and silver—to the bank to exchange for cash, and they took the opportunity to exploit them by reducing the weight of the scales. The peasants exchanged gold and silver worth 1.3 billion yuan, and they embezzled more than 120 million yuan as the "family property" of the bank. This incident aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

    The confusion of the bank's accounts is also rarely heard of. Their account books are loose-leaf, not numbered, and have no carry-over, which creates many loopholes for embezzlers. The bank lost 100 silver dollars, and it is still unknown where they are.

    The waste of the bank is also astonishing. The office expenses alone are more than 10 million yuan per month. They do not use receipts when they are reimbursed. The bank spent 5 million yuan to decorate the venue for a lottery savings prize drawing. Internal meetings also have banquets.

    The bureaucratic style of the cadres in the bank is also infuriating. The president of the bank does not come downstairs, but makes phone calls when there is something to do, and approves as soon as he sees a note, which leads to errors in the implementation of policies. For example, the timber loan in August and September 1951 should have been to support the transportation of timber and solve the difficulties of the masses. However, the bank lent it to speculators, allowing them to disrupt the market, take the opportunity to raise prices, and seek exorbitant profits. When carrying out livestock insurance business, the bank cadres went to the countryside without going through the district, insured cattle as soon as they saw them, and paid compensation as soon as they heard of deaths, without investigation or understanding, so that bad people could take advantage of them. Some people deliberately starved their cattle to death after insuring them, so that they could sell the hides for money and get compensation. Therefore, the bank lost a lot of money in livestock insurance, causing losses to state property. However, the responsible comrades of the bank knew nothing about the above problems in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    I believe that the leading cadres and all comrades of the Suichuan County People's Bank must seriously conduct a thorough check on the corruption, waste, and bureaucracy of the bank.

    从奸商李寅廷暗害志愿军事实中
    我们认识到资产阶级进攻的猖狂性
    编辑同志：英勇的中国人民志愿军为了抗美援朝、保家卫国，在战场上出生入死，奋勇杀敌。但在他们负伤治疗时，却碰到了奸商李寅廷替美帝国主义伸出来的尖刀——带有化脓菌的烂棉花絮成的救急包。李寅廷的这种罪行，是所有爱国人民，爱好和平的人民所万难容忍的，我们要求政府赶快给奸商李寅廷以最严厉的惩处，以泄全国人民之恨。
    从这个事件中，我们得到一个沉痛的教训：不法资本家唯利是图，对祖国、对人民、对我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军所造成的损失是无法补偿的。他们仇视祖国人民，仇视为祖国、为人类和平而战斗的中国人民志愿军。我们应当从这个事实中，更清晰地认识到资产阶级对无产阶级的猖狂进攻及其严重的危害性；我们应当团结得更紧，来全力打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，不获全胜决不收兵。

    为被暗害的志愿军伤病员报仇
    编辑同志：奸商李寅廷暗害志愿军的罪恶行为，和我们全国人民一点一滴地节省几百元、几千元用来支援我们志愿军的爱国行为，是多么显明的对比呀！奸商们真是一群毫无人性的祖国人民的叛徒。
    这一事件，使我们更深刻更具体地了解到资产阶级唯利是图的本质，也说明了这些奸商是我们全国人民的死敌。我是人民解放军一个普通的战士，我和全国人民一样，不能容忍这些罪大恶极的奸商。我要求政府严惩李寅廷和犯有同样罪行的奸商，为那些被他们暗害的残废或牺牲了的志愿军伤病员报仇！　　　　　　中国人民解放军某部

    无耻的奸商李寅廷，唯利是图，竟不顾祖国人民的安全，暗害志愿军的生命。这和美帝国主义直接侵略杀害我们有什么分别呢？我们能对资产阶级的这种猖狂进攻袖手旁观吗？让我们发出最坚决的呼声：彻底摧毁资产阶级的猖狂进攻，严惩美帝国主义帮凶分子李寅廷！

    中共杨柳青镇委书记刘蒂贪污受贿应受处分
    中共河北省杨柳青镇委书记兼镇长刘蒂，违犯国法党纪侵占农民土地，动用大批救济粮、地方粮，投入机关生产，并明目张胆地偷漏国税，造成国家资财的严重损失。
    一九五○年春，天津专区灾情很重，刘蒂却动用救济粮二万六千五百斤，投入机关生产。刘蒂又非法动用市政建设费、卫生事业费等，合粮食十二万四千斤，动用公款（罚款）一亿元，搞了油坊、磨坊、成衣局等。他霸占农民土地二百余亩，开办三个砖窑厂，并吓唬农民说：“谁不拿出土地，谁就是不抗美援朝！”
    刘蒂为了个人享乐，曾支持税务局局长常建偷盗国税一千五百万元。一九五一年，杨柳青镇五个生产单位偷盗国税九千六百多万元。刘蒂经常大吃大喝。据初步揭发的数字，他个人贪污八百万元。在他的享乐思想影响下，杨柳青镇委机关只一九五一年即挥霍了八千多万元，全镇各机关共挥霍一亿一千多万元。
    另外，刘蒂曾接受张子善三百五十万元的贿赂，为了隐蔽自己的罪行，他曾假装积极，反对刘青山、张子善。他曾贿赂中共镇委员会秘书董诵之七十万元，要董帮他改账，但被董拒绝。他规定各部门不许单独作反贪污工作的报告，由镇委统一报告。对于这些行为，他在检讨中一直没有交代。因此，至今天津地委对刘蒂的罪行还一直蒙在鼓里。
    我认为刘蒂这种盗窃国家资财的违法乱纪行为，已使国家财产受到无法估计的损失，并严重地损害了党和人民政府的威信。我建议党、政领导机关，应给予刘蒂以党纪国法的制裁。
    　　　河北省人民检察署天津专区分署　张　增
    　编者按：河北省人民检察署天津专区分署张增来信所揭发的中共杨柳青镇委员会书记刘蒂的错误是很严重的，我们认为中共河北省委和天津地委应派人切实调查，按照党的原则，严肃地处理这件事，并将结果在报上公布。
    江西省遂川县人民银行
    贪污浪费官僚主义现象严重
    有关部门应彻底检查该行工作
    编辑同志：江西省遂川县人民银行的贪污浪费和官僚主义现象，是十分严重的。该行好几个干部都兼做生意。如周晋三卖毛线；秘书周作楹卖布，甚至贩卖银元、私放高利贷；业务股长黄澄清曾买了三百担谷子到南昌去卖。该行股长以上的干部，差不多都到私商家吃过饭。行长也有以私人名义借款做生意的行为。去年土地改革时，当地群众拿分得的斗争果实——金银等到银行去兑换现款，他们乘机用克秤减色的办法进行剥削。农民兑换了合十三亿元的金银，他们从中贪污了一亿二千多万元作为本行的“家当”。这件事引起群众极大不满。
    银行账目的混乱也是很少听到的。他们的账本是活页的，也不编号码，更没有结转，给贪污分子造成了很多的空隙。该行丢了一百块银洋，直到现在也没有下落。
    该行的浪费现象也是惊人的。只办公费一项每月就是一千多万元。他们报销时都不用单据。该行举办一个有奖储蓄开奖大会，布置会场就用了五百万元。内部开会也会餐。
    行内干部的官僚主义作风也是令人愤慨的。行长不下楼，有事就打电话，见条子就批，以致造成执行政策上的错误。如一九五一年八、九月的木材贷款，应该是扶助木材外运，解决群众困难。而该行竟贷给投机倒把的商人，使他们扰乱市场，乘机抬价，牟取暴利。在开展牲畜保险业务时，银行干部下乡不通过区，见牛就保，听说死了就赔，也不调查了解，以致给坏人钻了空子。有的人在耕牛保险后，故意将牛饿死，既卖牛皮赚钱，又可得赔款。因此，该行在牲畜保险当中赔本不少，使国家财产受到损失。而该行负责同志，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中对上述问题，竟是一问三不知。
    我认为遂川县人民银行的领导干部和全体同志，必须认真地对本行的贪污浪费和官僚主义现象做一次彻底的检查。
