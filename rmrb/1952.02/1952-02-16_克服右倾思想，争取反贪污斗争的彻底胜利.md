    The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is intensifying across the country. The facts of the past two months have proven that large-scale embezzlers and thieves exist in large numbers.  Moreover, most acts of corruption and theft, especially large-scale ones, are carried out jointly by internal saboteurs sent in or pulled over by the bourgeoisie, colluding with illegal merchants and capitalists from the outside. This fact shows that the occurrence of a large number of corruption and theft phenomena is not merely a matter of the personal character of the corrupt and thieves, but mainly the result of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks and serious erosion of the revolutionary ranks. This attack and erosion has completely corrupted many revolutionary cadres, turning them into economic counter-revolutionaries; even some revolutionary organs have been partially or completely occupied by them, degenerating to the point where they are scarcely distinguishable from the Kuomintang bureaucratic organs. The Common Program is being undermined, the policies of the People's Government are being distorted, the leadership of the working class is being usurped, and the bourgeoisie is desperately stealing and attempting to usurp the fruits of the people's revolution. Therefore, the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and the theft of state economic intelligence, is, in essence, a struggle to maintain and consolidate the leadership of the working class. Like all great revolutionary struggles, this struggle only allows for victory, not defeat, only for thoroughness, not compromise. If we do not have the greatest courage and determination, and do not exert the greatest effort, we will certainly not be able to achieve a complete victory in the struggle.

    Educated by a large number of facts, the majority of cadres and masses in the revolutionary camp have realized the seriousness of the enemy situation and the great revolutionary significance of launching this struggle. Therefore, they have widely and actively taken action, formed strong command organs and combat teams, and launched a courageous internal and external pincer attack and tenacious encirclement and suppression struggle against the corrupt and thieves, determined to search out all corrupt and thieves, especially large-scale embezzlers and thieves. This firm determination and fighting will enable us to continuously achieve significant victories every day.

    However, up to now, a portion of the troops, especially a portion of the commanders, still have serious right-leaning thoughts. They have consistently underestimated the enemy situation and cannot see the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the revolutionary ranks, nor can they see the dangerous situation caused by this attack. Their attitude towards this revolutionary struggle is passive. Some of these commanders seem to acknowledge on the surface that the bourgeoisie is attacking and eroding the revolutionary ranks, and acknowledge the seriousness of the problem. But they lack the will to fight. They are hesitant, timid, and wavering, and have been unable to make a decision to fight. Just as the masses have begun to array themselves for battle against the criminals, before the first round is even finished, they are already shouting that things are "excessive," "too left," and "don't make a mess of things." When they see the criminals shedding tears and sighing, they are afraid that the criminals have been "wronged," and even secretly offer "comfort," turning major issues into minor ones, and heavy crimes into light ones. When they see the criminals beating their chests to pledge, swear, and curse, they easily believe them to be sincere, and call off the troops. They are afraid of even minor deviations occurring in the mass struggle, preferring to let the movement be half-dead or die prematurely, allowing the criminals to continue to harm the country and the people. They emphasize the past revolutionary history and merits of certain criminals without principle, believing that work cannot be carried out without these people, or fearing that no one will dare to do economic work in the future, and therefore adopt an indefinite and hopeless approach of "patiently persuading them to see the light." They still allow those who have been removed from their posts or are being investigated to enjoy their original living standards and attend important cadre meetings, spending their days idle and carefree. Certain "senior" personnel who have been arrested and brought to justice also receive special care, akin to convalescence. All of this shows that a portion of our commanders are suffering from severe spinelessness and cannot lead the mass struggle to the end.

    There are also some who hold a negative attitude towards carrying out the struggle in the industrial and commercial sectors. They fear that carrying out the struggle on a large scale will affect production, business, and the lives and jobs of workers and shop assistants, and do not actively study effective ways to guarantee the lives and jobs of workers and shop assistants. They express helplessness in the face of the unreasonable clamoring of illegal capitalists, do not offer forceful rebuttals, and let them be, even expressing sympathy, as if the mass struggle has really gone "too far." They blame the capitalists' illegal behavior on our correct policy of allowing the existence and development of the bourgeoisie, and therefore refuse to take political and legal measures to sanction illegal industrialists and businessmen. They hold an attitude of distrust towards launching large-scale worker and shop assistant denunciations, and do not actively organize forces to conduct in-depth inspections, contenting themselves with some small pieces of information confessed by the capitalists themselves, and refusing to press ahead and force the other side to make a thorough confession. They also fail to take decisive measures against illegal acts such as capitalists suppressing and undermining mass denunciation struggles, resisting government inspections, and even refusing government personnel to attend meetings of industrial and commercial federations and organizing "defensive alliances," but instead indulge and tolerate them.

    This part of the commanders is not qualified. In the areas and units under their command, there is no battle line, no fighting, and no revolutionary situation. The masses are lifeless or indignant, while the criminals are arrogant, free from punishment, and even continue to engage in criminal activities.

    The current moment is the most intense stage of the struggle. In order to carry out this great revolutionary struggle to the end and achieve a complete victory, we must first take all effective measures to eliminate this right-leaning thought and approach. This is an important prerequisite. To this end, it is necessary to immediately conduct a serious assessment of the personnel commanding the battle in various regions and units. Those who have right-leaning thoughts and emotions must be told to immediately conduct a profound self-criticism and thorough transformation, take up arms and go to the battlefield, go to the front line, and become commanders in name and in fact. Those who are unwilling to immediately implement the transformation, whether they have been ideologically captured by the bourgeoisie, or whether they themselves have unclean hands, should be resolutely removed from their command posts, and boldly appoint those who have shown high enthusiasm, initiative, and command ability in the battle to replace them. Concentrate such people and form a strong, pure, and fighting command.

    The fighting command should concentrate all its strength, unhesitatingly mobilize the broad masses, organize a strong team to encircle and suppress the corrupt and thieves, formulate a practical plan and steps for the encirclement and suppression, and launch an irreconcilable and tireless encirclement and suppression struggle. Do not limit the actions of the masses for fear of minor deviations, but constantly educate them to learn how to check the economy, check accounts, and learn how to analyze the essence of things from superficial phenomena, observe facts; learn the tactics of fighting against internal saboteurs and illegal capitalists; use vivid facts and new victories to educate and encourage the masses, and constantly improve their class consciousness, patriotic enthusiasm, and fighting initiative, and enrich their fighting experience and knowledge. It is necessary to refute various fallacies and clamoring to protect corrupt and thieves among the masses, educate the masses to recognize the various soft and hard struggle strategies of corrupt and thieves, not to be fooled, not to stop fighting, but to show redoubled tenacity, track and pursue, and never call off the troops until a complete victory is won.

    In order to strengthen the fighting force, those small and medium-sized corrupt and thieves who have sincerely confessed, are determined to reform, and are willing to atone for their crimes should be dealt with quickly so that they can join the fighting force, contribute all their knowledge and experience, and atone for their crimes; unite the more upright industrialists and businessmen in the industrial and commercial sectors and those who have faults but can resolutely confess and correct them, form a broad united front of combat, and jointly conduct this struggle.

    For those corrupt and thieves who have been proven by facts but refuse to confess and those illegal elements who suppress denunciation, suppress democracy and refuse to correct themselves, no matter whether they have had achievements in the past or how high their positions are, they must be dismissed or arrested and brought to justice without leniency, so as not to dampen the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle and hinder the progress of the movement. Indulging these illegal elements is a crime against the country and the people.

    For some temporary difficulties that may arise and will inevitably arise from sanctioning corrupt and thieves, we should solve them with active fighting methods, rather than abandoning the fight for fear of choking. Some capitalists attempt to suppress the mass denunciation struggle by closing shops, transferring funds, and dismissing workers and shop assistants, which should be resolutely stopped, and legal means should be taken to ban them when necessary. Factories and shops that go bankrupt or need to reduce staff due to the return of stolen goods or fines should use all means to guarantee the jobs of their workers and shop assistants. Those in the revolutionary ranks who have doubts about economic work should be patiently educated to reassure them to work. Those who ask to be transferred from incorrect motives and deliberately make things difficult should be given necessary criticism and struggle to correct their mistakes.

    The time is very pressing and the task is very arduous. All members of all fighting teams should fully recognize the great revolutionary significance of this fighting task, fully estimate the enemy situation, bravely and actively act and fight, and carry out this revolutionary struggle to the end with a firm will and determination to win a complete victory.

### 克服右倾思想，争取反贪污斗争的彻底胜利

    克服右倾思想，争取反贪污斗争的彻底胜利
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，正在全国范围内日益剧烈地开展着。两个多月来的事实证明大贪污犯和大盗窃犯是大量存在的。而贪污盗窃行为，尤其是大规模的贪污盗窃行为，大多数是由资产阶级派进来或拉过去的内奸分子和外界的不法商人、资本家勾结起来，共同进行的。这一事实说明：大量的贪污盗窃现象的发生，决不仅只是贪污盗窃者个人的品质问题，而主要地是资产阶级向革命阵营猖狂进攻和严重侵蚀的结果。这种进攻和侵蚀，已经使许多革命干部完全变质，蜕化成为经济反革命分子；甚至有若干革命机关被他们部分攻占或全部攻占，蜕化到与国民党官僚机关很少区别。共同纲领被破坏着，人民政府的各种政策被歪曲着，工人阶级的领导权被篡夺着，资产阶级拚命窃取并企图篡夺人民革命的胜利果实。因此，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义和反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，按其实质讲来，乃是保持和巩固工人阶级领导权的斗争。和历次伟大的革命斗争一样，这个斗争也是只许胜利，不许失败，只许进行到底，不许中途妥协的。如果我们没有最大的勇气与决心，不拿出最大的力量，就决然不能取得斗争的彻底胜利。
    经过大量的事实的教育，革命阵营中的多数干部和群众已经认识了敌情的严重和开展这个斗争的伟大的革命意义。因而广泛地积极行动起来，组成了坚强的指挥机关和战斗队伍，对贪污盗窃分子展开了勇猛的内外夹击和顽强的围剿斗争，决心把所有贪污盗窃分子尤其是大贪污犯、大盗窃犯搜捕净尽。这种坚强的决心和战斗意志，使我们不断地天天取得重大的胜利。
    但是，至今为止，一部分队伍尤其是一部分指挥人员，仍然有严重的右倾思想。他们对敌情始终估计不足，看不见资产阶级在向革命阵营猖狂进攻，看不见这种进攻所造成的危险形势。他们对待这个革命斗争的态度是消极的，被动的。这一部分指挥员中的某些人，表面上似乎也承认资产阶级是在进攻和侵蚀着革命阵营，承认问题的严重性。但他们十分缺乏战斗的意志。他们瞻前顾后，畏首畏尾，动摇犹豫，一直下不了战斗的决心。群众刚刚对罪犯们摆开战斗的阵势，还没有打完第一个回合，他们就嚷着“过火了”，“过左了”，“可不要闹出乱子来”。他们看见罪犯们流泪叹气，就害怕罪犯们受了“委曲”，甚至暗地去进行“安慰”，把大事化小，重罪化轻。看见罪犯们拍着胸脯具结、发誓、赌咒，就轻易地信以为真，收兵罢战。他们害怕群众斗争中发生微小的偏差，宁愿让运动不死不活或半途夭折，让罪犯们继续危害国家人民。他们无原则地强调某些罪犯过去的革命历史和功绩，认为离了这些人就无法进行工作，或者害怕以后没有人敢再做经济工作，因而对罪犯们采取的办法是无限期的无希望的“耐心说服，打通思想”。他们对已被撤职或撤职查办的人，仍然允许他们享受原来的各种生活待遇，参加重要的干部会议，终日无事，逍遥自在。某些已被逮捕法办的“高级”人员，也受到特殊的照顾，形同休养。这些都说明了我们的一部分指挥人员害着严重的软骨病，不能领导群众斗争到底。
    也有一些人对于在工商界中开展斗争抱着消极的态度。他们害怕大规模地开展斗争会影响生产，影响营业，影响工人店员的生活和职业，而不积极研究有效的办法来保证工人店员的生活和职业。他们在不法资本家的无理叫嚣面前表示束手无策，不进行有力的驳斥，听之任之，甚至表示同情，似乎群众斗争真的已经“过火”了。他们把资本家的不法行为归罪于我们容许资产阶级存在和发展的正确政策，因而不肯采取政治的法律的手段予不法的工商业者以制裁。他们对于大规模发动工人店员进行检举斗争抱着不信任的态度，也不积极组织力量进行深入的检查，满足于资本家自己坦白出来的一些小材料，不肯乘胜直追，迫使对方彻底坦白。对于资本家压制和破坏群众检举斗争、抗拒政府检查、甚至拒绝政府人员参加工商业联合会的会议以及组织“攻守同盟”等的不法行为，他们也不采取断然的措置，而一味迁就、容忍。
    这一部分指挥人员是不称职的。在他们指挥之下的地区和单位，没有战线，没有战斗，没有革命的形势。群众死气沉沉或愤愤不平，罪犯们则趾高气扬，逍遥法外，甚至在继续进行着犯罪的勾当。
    目前正是斗争的最紧张阶段。为了把这一伟大革命斗争进行到底，取得彻底的胜利，必须首先采取一切有效的办法，肃清这种右倾的思想和作法。这是一个重要的前提。为此，必须立即对各地区各单位指挥战斗的人员进行认真的考核。对其中有着右倾思想情绪的人员，必须叫他立即进行深刻的检讨和彻底的转变，拿起武器上战场，上前线，成为名符其实的指挥员。对不肯立即实行转变的人，不管他是在思想上做了资产阶级的俘虏，或者是自己手面不干净，都应该坚决地把他们从指挥岗位上撤下来，大胆地任命那些在战斗中表现了高度热情、积极性和具有指挥才能的人去代替他们。集中这样的人，组成强有力的纯洁的战斗指挥部。
    战斗的指挥部应该集中一切力量，丝毫不犹豫地发动广大群众，组织围剿贪污盗窃分子的坚强队伍，订出围剿的切实计划和步骤，展开不调和、不疲倦的围剿斗争。不要因为怕发生一点微小的偏差而限制群众的行动，而要不断地教育他们学会查经济、查账目，学会从表面现象分析事情的本质，观察事实；学会和内奸、不法资本家斗争的策略；用活的事实和新的战果去教育和鼓舞群众，不断地提高他们的阶级觉悟、爱国热情和战斗的积极性，丰富他们的斗争经验和知识。要在群众中驳斥各种袒护贪污盗窃分子的谬论和叫嚣，教育群众去认识贪污盗窃分子的各种软的硬的斗争策略，不要上当，不要中止战斗，而要拿出加倍顽强的精神，跟踪追击，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    为了壮大战斗的队伍，对于已经真诚坦白、决心改过自新、戴罪立功的中小贪污盗窃分子，应该迅速处理，使他们加入战斗的队伍，献出自己所有的知识和经验，立功赎罪；团结工商界中比较正派的工商业者和虽有毛病而能坚决坦白改正的分子，组成广泛的战斗的统一战线，共同进行这一斗争。
    对于那些已被事实证明而拒不坦白的贪污盗窃分子和压制检举、压制民主而不肯改正的不法分子，不管他们过去是否有过功绩，职位有多高，必须毫不姑息地实行撤职或逮捕法办，以免打击群众的斗争热情，阻碍运动的前进。姑息这些不法分子，是对国家和人民的犯罪行为。
    对于因制裁贪污盗窃分子而可能产生而且必然要产生的某些暂时的困难，应该用积极的战斗的办法去解决，而不应该因咽废食，放弃战斗。有的资本家企图用关店、转移资金、解雇工人店员等方法来压抑群众检举斗争的，应该坚决加以制止，必要时要采取法律手段予以取缔。因退赃、罚款而倒闭或需要缩减人员的工厂和商店，应该用一切办法保证其工人店员的职业。革命阵营中有人对经济工作发生疑惧的，应该进行耐心的教育，使他们安心工作。有从不正确的动机出发而要求调动工作，故意为难的，应该对他们进行必要的批评和斗争，使他们改正错误。
    时机十分紧迫，任务十分艰巨。所有战斗队伍中的一切成员，都应该充分地认识这一战斗任务的伟大革命意义，充分地估计敌情，勇敢地积极地行动起来，战斗起来，以必获全胜的坚定意志和决心，把这一革命斗争进行到底。
