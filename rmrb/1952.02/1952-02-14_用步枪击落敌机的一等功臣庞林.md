Pang Lin is a sentry of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the highway in the Donglinli area of North Hwanghae Province, Korea. Every day, he watches the enemy planes circling and scouting here with angry eyes.

On the night of November 12th last year, four trucks loaded with military supplies had just passed Pang Lin when enemy planes appeared in the sky, followed by gunfire and explosions. Pang Lin immediately went to check along the road and found that a truck driver had been seriously injured and was lying on the road. When Pang Lin carried him to a nearby air-raid shelter, he found that he was already unconscious. Pang Lin stared at the dead man, his eyes filled with grief and indignation, but he immediately wiped away his tears and walked out of the air-raid shelter. He silently made up his mind: "If you dare to come again, I will definitely shoot you down!" On the way, a bomber dived down, and at the same time, the silver beam of the searchlight was tightly pointing at the enemy plane. The altitude of the plane was no more than 700 meters. Pang Lin thought to himself, "The chance for revenge has come." He rolled over into the ditch next to the road, raised his Mosin-Nagant rifle, and aimed at the fuselage. "Bang! Bang!" He fired two shots, but missed. The enemy plane dived down a second time. This time, Pang Lin had experience. He moved the aiming point three meters in front of the fuselage. "Bang! Bang!" Two more shots. The plane immediately caught fire, somersaulted twice, and crashed to the ground.

The story of Pang Lin shooting down an airplane with rifle bullets immediately spread throughout the Donglinli area, enhancing the confidence of the Volunteer Army soldiers in anti-aircraft operations. Pang Lin was awarded the first-class merit for resisting America and aiding Korea. (Attached picture)

    用步枪击落敌机的一等功臣庞林
    庞林是人民志愿军某部在朝鲜黄海北道东林里一带公路上的哨兵，他每天都用愤怒的眼光注视着来这里盘旋侦察的敌机。
    去年十一月十二日的夜里，四辆满载军需物品的卡车，刚刚从庞林身边开过去，天空里出现了敌机，接着传来了一阵枪声和爆炸声。庞林立刻沿公路去检查，发现有一位汽车司机，已身负重伤，倒在公路上。当庞林把他背到附近防空洞里的时候，发现他已经昏迷不醒了。庞林凝视着死者，眼眶里充满了悲愤的泪水，但他立即擦干了眼泪，走出了防空洞。他默默地下了决心：“你敢再来，我非揍下你来不可！”庞林走到半路上，有一架轰炸机俯冲下来，也就在这个时候，探照灯的银色光柱已紧紧的指着敌机，看去，飞机的高度也不过七百公尺。庞林暗暗地想：“报仇的机会到了。”他一翻身滚到公路旁边的交通沟里，端起他的“水连珠”，对准机身，“砰！砰！”就是两枪，但是没有打中。敌机又二次俯冲下来，这次，庞林有了经验，他将瞄准点移到机身前面三公尺的地方，“砰！砰！”又是两枪。飞机立刻着了火，连翻了两个筋斗，一直栽下地来。
    庞林用步枪子弹击落飞机的故事，立刻传遍了东林里一带，增强了志愿军战士对空作战的信心。庞林立了抗美援朝的一等功。（附图片）
