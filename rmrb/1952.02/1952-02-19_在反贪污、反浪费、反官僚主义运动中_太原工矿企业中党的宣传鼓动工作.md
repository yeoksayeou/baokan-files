    In the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
    Party Propaganda Work in Taiyuan Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Li Xiaolin
    Party organizations in industrial, mining, and enterprise units in Taiyuan City have emphasized propaganda work related to the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, enabling this intense struggle to be vigorously launched in forty-six factories and mines.
    The most significant characteristic of this propaganda work is the concentrated use of propaganda resources to create an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy atmosphere within a limited timeframe, ensuring that everyone is subjected to this class education. For example, the general party branch of the Taiyuan Machine Factory concentrated fourteen key propaganda cadres and propagandists from the Party, government, labor union, Communist Youth League, and workshops to form an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy propaganda central group, with assigned responsibilities for interviewing, editing, and creating cartoons. They placed various propaganda posters and newspapers, such as "Big Character Posters," "Come See the Reports and Accusations," and "Everyone Look," in places where workers frequently passed. These posters and newspapers used large characters and short, vivid language, attracting much attention and producing good results. For example, after workers read the article about exemplary party member Cui Zhusan "who was not afraid of attacks and suppression, and kept reporting upwards," they said, "With Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government in charge, the anti-corruption campaign will definitely be thorough." A doctor in the medical room, seeing his name mentioned in the newspaper, immediately went to the general party branch to confess his acts of corruption and bribery. In addition, they opened a public square propaganda area, covering the surroundings with various propaganda posters and newspapers. Every day, workers gathered in this square after lunch to listen to the propagandists. Some propagandists exposed the bureaucratic work style of leaders, some pointed to cartoons to explain the corrupt practices of Li Shangming in the factory, and some used loudspeakers to encourage everyone to quickly stand at the forefront of the struggle and promptly report and expose corrupt elements. In this way, the public square propaganda area attracted all the staff and workers. The staff and workers received a very profound education in a short period.
    Organizing propaganda teams is also a good way to carry out propaganda on a large scale. Factory 743 formed a propaganda team of more than one hundred people, including a band, a choir, and propagandists, to carry out propaganda throughout the factory, making brief mobilizations at each location. For example, when they went to the factory headquarters, they mobilized the staff and workers, saying: "We have already taken action, why are you still silent? Hurry up and confess and expose!" The steel factory's propaganda team carried over one hundred cartoon signs, three blackboards, and prepared nineteen kuaiban (rhythmic talk), as well as "foreign films" (slideshows) and crosstalk, to conduct extensive propaganda in workshops, dormitories, and residential areas. Staff, workers, and family members, seeing the cartoons of corrupt merchants corrupting cadres, pointed and scolded: "This guy with a pointy head, defrauding state property, is really hateful!"
    Various factories and mines also adopted forms such as exhibitions, public square plays, and model propaganda to conduct extensive propaganda, which had a great impact. The power department of the steel factory displayed the flour and rice that corrupt elements had accepted as bribes in an exhibition for everyone to visit. It was very popular among the masses.
    In addition, fully utilizing forms such as confession meetings, "taking off your pants" meetings (thorough self-criticism), reporting meetings, and struggle sessions to publicize policies, educate, and organize the masses to wage a struggle against the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie is also essential.
    To enable these meetings to play a greater role in educating the masses, the meeting content must be imbued with clear policy thinking, and there must be thorough preparation. When conditions permit (large factories with many people, broadcasting equipment, etc.), it is necessary to organize people outside the meeting to listen to the live broadcast of the meeting, which will have a greater impact. The steel factory did this. Two days before convening the rally to struggle against the corrupt official Li Shuren, the Party Committee Propaganda Department convened a meeting of propaganda cadres, formed various groups for conference propaganda, listening inspection, news reporting, and literary propaganda. Leading comrades repeatedly explained that this was a serious battle to repel the bourgeoisie's attack on us, and demanded that all groups do their work well. At the struggle meeting, when the staff and workers heard about Li Shuren's crimes, they were all indignant. They said, "We worked hard to increase production and donate, and only donated an airplane in half a year, but he wasted ten of them." Everyone unanimously demanded that he be immediately sent to the government for legal action. At this time, the propagandists enthusiastically carried out propaganda activities during the meeting. They wrote on a small piece of paper: "Do you have corruption? Now is a good opportunity to confess!" "It's not too late for corrupt elements to turn back now!" This piece of paper spread throughout the venue like a bullet, hitting the hearts of everyone who had problems, pointing out the way for these people, and encouraging them to boldly confess, and encouraging others to report. As a result, more than thirty people requested to confess and report at the meeting. Wang Jingui, a corrupt element in the transportation department, after being educated at the meeting, immediately returned the train ticket he had already bought (preparing to escape) and automatically confessed his problems. This struggle meeting was truly well-prepared, well-brewed, and used real people and events for education, hitting accurately and achieving great results. On the contrary, when Factory 145 convened a struggle and confession meeting, it was not well-prepared in advance, which led to the leadership appearing at a loss at the meeting, which had a very bad effect. This lesson should be remembered.

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中
    太原工矿企业中党的宣传鼓动工作
    李晓林
    太原市工、矿、企业党组织重视了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的宣传鼓动工作，使这一紧张的斗争已在四十六个厂矿大张旗鼓地开展起来了。
    这次宣传工作的最大特点，是集中使用宣传力量，限期造成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的舆论，使每处每人都受到这种阶级教育。例如太原机器厂党总支就把党、政、工、团、车间的宣传干部和宣传员中的骨干共十四人，集中起来，组成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的宣传中心组，分工负责采访、编辑、漫画等工作。他们在工人来往必经之地，布置了各种宣传画、报，如“大字报”、“检举报都来看”、“大家瞧”等。这些报、画，字大话短，生动活泼，十分引人注目，效果很好。如工人们看了模范党员崔祝三“不怕打击与压制、一直往上告”的稿子，纷纷说：“有毛主席、中央人民政府作主，反贪污运动一定能搞彻底。”医疗室某医生看到报上点他的名字，立即跑到党总支去坦白了自己贪污受贿的事实。另外，他们开辟了广场宣传区，将广场四周布满各种宣传画和报纸。每天工人们吃了午饭，聚集在这个广场上，听宣传员讲解。宣传员有的向大家揭露领导方面的官僚主义作风，有的指着漫画向大家解释本厂李尚明的贪污花样，有的拿着喇叭筒鼓励大家迅速地站在斗争的最前面，赶快检举、揭发贪污分子。这样，这个广场宣传区就把全体职工都吸引在这里了。职工在很短的时间得到很深刻的教育。
    组织宣传鼓动队也是大张旗鼓地进行宣传的良好方式之一。七四三厂把乐队、歌咏队、宣传员一百多人组成一支宣传队伍，在全厂进行宣传，每到一处都进行简短鼓动。如到厂部就对职工鼓动说：“我们已经行动起来了，你们为什么还沉闷呢？赶快坦白揭发吧！”钢铁厂的宣传鼓动队举着一百多个漫画牌，三块黑板报，并准备了十九个快板，还有洋片、相声等，到车间、宿舍、家属住区广泛宣传。职工和家属看到奸商腐蚀干部的漫画，指着骂：“这家伙尖尖的脑袋，哄骗国家财产，真可恶！”
    各厂、矿还采用展览会、广场剧、模型宣传等形式，广泛进行宣传，作用很大。钢铁厂动力部的展览会，把贪污分子受贿的白面、大米陈列出来，让大家参观。很受群众欢迎。
    另外，充分地利用坦白会、“脱裤子”会、检举、斗争会等形式，宣传政策，教育和组织群众向资产阶级腐朽的思想展开斗争，也是十分必要的。
    要使这些会议发挥更大的教育群众的作用，会议内容必须贯穿着明确的政策思想，而且要有充分的准备。这样的会议在条件许可下（大工厂人多，有广播设备等），要组织会外群众收听会议实况广播，这会收到更大的效果。如钢铁厂就是这样作的。他们在召开斗争贪污犯李树人大会前的两天，党委宣传部就召集宣传干部开会，组成了大会宣传、收听检查、通讯报道、文艺宣传等各组，领导同志并反复地说明这是一场打退资产阶级向我们进攻的严重战斗，要求各组必须把工作作好。斗争大会上，当职工们听到李树人的罪状时，一个个都很激愤。他们说：“我们努力增产捐献，半年才捐了一架飞机，他却给浪费了十架。”大家一致要求立即送政府法办。这时宣传员在会议进行过程中，宣传活动热烈展开，他们在一块小纸片上写上“你有贪污吗？现在是坦白的好机会！”“贪污分子现在回头，一点不晚”等字，这个纸片传遍全场，像一颗子弹一样，射击着每一个有问题的人的心，给这些人指出了出路，鼓励他们大胆地进行了坦白，并鼓励另外一些人进行了检举。结果，在大会上要求坦白、检举的有三十多人。运输部贪污分子王金贵受到大会教育后，把已经买好的火车票（准备逃走）立即退了，自动坦白地把问题作了交代。这次斗争大会真正做到准备充分，酝酿成熟，以真人活事进行教育，打得准确，效果很大。相反的一四五厂召开斗争、坦白大会时，由于事前准备不足，以致在会上领导方面表现了手足无措，影响很不好。这种教训应该记取。
