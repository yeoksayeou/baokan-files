    To further mobilize people from all walks of life to suppress unscrupulous merchants and major grafters, the Tianjin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee held an "Exhibition on Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy." On the first day of the exhibition's opening (February 2nd), there were more than 6,000 visitors. The exhibition uses pictures, photographs, models, and exhibits of typical cases to vividly expose the crimes of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the working class over the past three years, illustrating the serious harm of the bourgeoisie's corrupt and decadent thinking to the country and the people.

    The exhibition content is divided into five parts: comprehensive, opposing illegal acts of illegal capitalists, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy. The comprehensive section uses photographs, cartoons, and models to illustrate the progress and initial achievements of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Tianjin, as well as the government's policies towards corrupt elements and illegal capitalists. The focus of the exhibition is on opposing the illegal acts of illegal capitalists. This section focuses on exposing the crimes of unscrupulous merchants such as bribery, tax evasion, using substandard materials, stealing state property, speculating in gold and silver, disrupting finance, concealing enemy assets, and stealing state economic intelligence. Charts indicate that unscrupulous merchants in Tianjin have evaded a total of 800 billion yuan in taxes since liberation. The exhibition collected nineteen methods used by unscrupulous merchants to corrupt state personnel. From flattery and ingratiation to luring people into drug addiction and prostitution, unscrupulous merchants used various vile and shameless methods to drag cadres down, and then steal large amounts of state property with "ten thousand percent profit." The anti-corruption section exposes the huge harm caused to the country by corrupt elements. Cartoon strips and exhibits illustrate that some retained personnel, due to the lack of ideological transformation, have become a weak link in the bourgeoisie's attack. They colluded with unscrupulous merchants to defraud state property. There are also a small number of old cadres who, after entering the city, could not withstand the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, became corrupted and decadent, and became criminals against the state. The losses caused to the country by waste even exceed those caused by corruption. The anti-waste section uses case models to point out this fact. The anti-bureaucracy section exhibits the situation where the China National Import and Export Corporation wasted 75 billion yuan due to the bureaucracy of its leading cadres. In addition, there are charts and exhibits illustrating the harm of red tape in government agencies. This section proves that bureaucracy is indeed a hotbed of corruption and waste, and also explains why the bureaucratic style is favored by unscrupulous merchants and illegal elements, and hated and opposed by the people.

    Staff from relevant units explained to the audience at the exhibition. Wang Shili, a tax bureau cadre corrupted by an unscrupulous merchant, and Zhang Jinzhou, an unscrupulous merchant who corrupted cadres, also appeared at the exhibition to explain the exhibits. Many viewers said that the exhibition provided them with a good education, allowing them to see from real examples the enormous harm caused to the country and the people by the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, and raised their vigilance against illegal capitalists.

    进一步动员人民围剿奸商和大贪污犯  
    天津举行反贪污反浪费反官僚主义展览会  
    用真凭实证揭发了资产阶级猖狂进攻的罪行
    为进一步动员各界人民围剿奸商和大贪污犯，天津市节约检查委员会举办“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义展览会”。展览会揭幕的第一天（二日），参观者就有六千多人。这个展览会把一些典型案件用图画、照片、模型和实物展览出来，生动地揭露了资产阶级三年来向工人阶级举行猖狂进攻的罪状，说明了资产阶级腐化堕落思想对国家人民的严重危害性。
    展览会内容分为综合、反对不法资本家的不法行为、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义五部分。综合部分是用照片、漫画和模型说明天津市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的进展情况和初步成绩，以及政府对待贪污分子和不法资本家的政策。展览会的重点是反对不法资本家的非法行为。这一部分着重揭发了奸商的行贿、偷税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、捣卖金银、扰乱金融、隐匿敌产、盗窃国家经济情报等罪行。图表指明，天津市不法商人在解放后共偷漏税款八千亿元。展览会搜集了奸商腐蚀国家工作人员所用的十九种方法。奸商们从谄媚逢迎，到引诱吸毒、嫖妓，用各种下流无耻的方法拖干部下水，然后“一本万利”地大量盗窃国家财产。反贪污部分中揭露了贪污分子给国家造成了巨大危害。连环画和实物说明，一部分留用人员，由于思想作风没有改造，成为资产阶级进攻的薄弱的一环。他们和奸商相互勾结，诈取国家资财。也有少数老干部，入城后经不起资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，腐化堕落，成为国家的罪人。浪费给国家造成的损失甚至超过贪污所造成的损失。反浪费部分用实例模型指明了这一事实。反官僚主义部分展出了中国进出口公司因为领导干部的官僚主义浪费七百五十亿元的情形。另外还有图表和实物说明政府机关中文牍主义的危害性。这一部分证明官僚主义确是贪污、浪费的温床，也说明了为什么官僚主义作风为奸商和不法分子所喜好，而为人民所痛恨，所反对。
    展览会中有有关单位的工作人员向观众讲解。被奸商腐蚀的税务局干部王世礼、腐蚀干部的奸商张锦洲并在展览会中现身说法，担任讲解工作。很多观众都表示这个展览会对自己进行了一次良好的教育，使自己从实物实例中看到了资产阶级猖狂进攻对国家和人民所造成的巨大危害，并提高了对不法资本家的警惕。
