    ▲ The Zhejiang Provincial Higher Education Department and Institute Adjustment Committee held its first meeting on January 2nd. In accordance with the spirit of the instructions on reforming and adjusting higher education made by the Central Government and the East China Ministry of Education, and the decisions of the National Normal Education Conference and the National Institute of Technology Presidents Conference, and combined with the specific circumstances of Zhejiang Province, the following adjustment plan was made: (1) The Engineering College of Zhejiang University and the Engineering College of Zhijiang University will be merged and adjusted. (2) The Medical College of Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Medical College will be merged to establish Zhejiang Medical College. (3) Zhejiang Normal College will be established on the basis of the School of Liberal Arts of Zhejiang University and the School of Arts and Sciences of Zhijiang University. The college address is currently located at Zhijiang University. The Normal School jointly run by the Provincial Department of Culture and Education and Zhejiang University will be incorporated into the Normal College as a specialized department. (4) The School of Economics and Finance of Zhijiang University will be changed to the independent Zhejiang College of Finance and Economics. The college address will temporarily remain at the original site and will be directly led and adjusted by the Provincial Department of Culture and Education.
    In order to effectively carry out the adjustment work, it was decided to establish three committees under the unified leadership of the Adjustment Committee: (1) Zhejiang University, Zhijiang University Engineering College Adjustment Committee, (2) Zhejiang Medical College Preparatory Committee, (3) Zhejiang Normal College Preparatory Committee. Efforts will be made to complete the adjustment plan during the winter vacation in order to lay a good foundation and further prepare for the expanded development in the autumn, so that higher education in Zhejiang can better serve the country's construction. The above three committees decided to start specific adjustment work in February.
    ▲ After the publication of the "Quick Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua, a cultural instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Xu Ke, the curator of the Gaobeidian Cultural Center in the suburbs of Beijing, understood the spirit of this new literacy method and believed that it was equally applicable to farmers with high political awareness. He organized twenty-six young male and female farmers with high learning needs in Gaobeidian, and started the experimental work of the "Quick Literacy Method" on January 10th. Now preliminary results have been achieved. They study for two hours every night, learned phonetic symbols for three days, pinyin for four days, reviewed for one day, and started to intensively recognize new characters from January 21st. In the twelve days until February 5th (four days of holiday for the Spring Festival), the students have recognized 618 new characters, and 23 students can read in order, backwards, or horizontally according to the character list. Now, it is estimated that 1,500 new characters can be intensively learned by mid-February. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has issued five sets of popular readings to help this experimental work. After the end of this experiment, the results will be summarized and methods for further promotion will be studied.

    ▲人民解放军某部文化教员祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”在报上公布后，北京市郊高碑店文化馆馆长许克，体会了这一新识字法的精神，认为在政治觉悟高的农民中是同样适用的。他就在高碑店组织了二十六个学习要求高的青年男女农民，自一月十日起，开始了“速成识字法”的实验工作，现在已获得初步成绩。他们每天晚上学习两小时，注音符号学了三天，拼音学了四天，复习一天，自一月二十一日开始突击认生字，到二月五日的十二天（春节放假四天）中，学员们已认识了六百一十八个生字，有二十三个学员能够按照字表的行列顺念，倒念或横念。现在，估计到二月中旬可以突击完一千五百个生字。北京市文教局为帮助这一实验工作已发给他们五套通俗读物。此次实验结束，将总结成绩，研究进一步推广的办法。
