Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd:

    The China National Resist America, Aid Korea Association announces the situation of national people's weapon donations as follows:

    In order to call on the people of the whole country to provide strong support to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting arduously in Korea, and to defeat the invading army of American imperialism as soon as possible, so as to protect the security of the motherland and the peace of the Far East, the Association issued an appeal to the people of the whole country on June 1st last year regarding the donation of weapons. Under the inspiration of high patriotism and internationalism, and under the inspiration of the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the people of the whole country enthusiastically responded to the Association's call, thus enabling this movement to successfully complete its task and be declared over by the end of December last year. In accordance with the provisions of the Association's notice of December 27th last year regarding the conclusion of the weapon donation movement, which stated that "the National Resist America, Aid Korea Association will announce the total amount of donations from major administrative regions, provinces, and major cities," the Association has, in conjunction with the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, accurately compiled statistics in accordance with the above provisions. The situation of the national people's weapon donations is now formally announced as follows:

    1. As of the end of December last year (i.e., up to December 31st), the total weapon donations remitted to the Association by the People's Banks of all provinces and cities across the country amounted to RMB 5024.687796521 billion yuan. Calculated at RMB 1.5 billion yuan per fighter plane, this is equivalent to 3349 planes plus a remainder.

    2. If the total amount of the above donations is divided by major administrative regions: East China ranks first, totaling RMB 1998.180045444 billion yuan, accounting for 39.76% of the total donations, equivalent to 1332.2 fighter planes. Central South ranks second, totaling RMB 1102.520146690 billion yuan, accounting for 21.94% of the total donations, equivalent to 735 fighter planes. North China ranks third, totaling RMB 683.364544091 billion yuan, accounting for 13.6% of the total donations, equivalent to 455.6 fighter planes. Northeast ranks fourth, totaling RMB 563.0018551622 billion yuan, accounting for 11.21% of the total donations, equivalent to 375.3 fighter planes. Southwest ranks fifth, totaling RMB 421.900601616 billion yuan, accounting for 8.4% of the total donations, equivalent to 281.2 fighter planes. Northwest ranks sixth, totaling RMB 212.873683883 billion yuan, accounting for 4.24% of the total donations, equivalent to 141.9 fighter planes. Inner Mongolia ranks seventh, totaling RMB 42.830223175 billion yuan, accounting for 0.85% of the total donations, equivalent to 28.5 fighter planes.

    3. The above donations have been fully delivered by the Association to the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and receipts have been received and are kept by the Association for future reference.

    4. The above donation figures are based solely on the amount of funds that the Head Office of the People's Bank of China had received and remitted to the Association by the end of December last year (i.e., up to December 31st), and do not include the amount of continued or supplementary donations from the people of the whole country after January 1st this year, as well as the amount of funds that the People's Bank of China has received and transferred to the Association. It is hoped that the major administrative regions will publish the amount of these continued or supplementary donations in the newspapers once more in accordance with past regulations after they have been completely stopped recently. The Association will also formally publish it again after collecting all these donations, for the reference of the people of the whole country.

    5. The donation figures published above should be carefully checked once by the People's Banks and the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branches and Branches in various places. If there are any errors, they should immediately telegraph the Head Office of the People's Bank of China or the Resist America, Aid Korea Association for inspection. In addition, if any organization, group, or individual in the country discovers or suspects that anyone in the Association and its branches at all levels, or in the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and its branches at all levels, has engaged in any fraud or embezzlement of weapon donations, they should boldly report it. If major cases are discovered as a result, the Association will give significant rewards to the informants.

    (The detailed list of weapon donations from major administrative regions and provinces and cities across the country is attached and can be found in the February 23rd Beijing People's Daily.)

    中国人民抗美援朝总会公布全国人民武器捐款的情况
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会公布全国人民武器捐献的情况如下：
    本会为了号召全国人民给正在朝鲜艰苦作战的中国人民志愿军以有力支援，早日打败美帝国主义者的侵略军，以保卫祖国的安全和远东和平，曾于去年六月一日向全国人民发出关于捐献武器的号召。全国人民在高度的爱国主义和国际主义的鼓舞下，在中国人民志愿军英勇战斗的鼓舞下，热烈响应本会号召，因而使此项运动于去年十二月底，即胜利完成任务和宣告结束。依据本会去年十二月二十七日关于结束武器捐献运动工作的通知“抗美援朝总会公布各大行政区，各省和各大城市的捐献总数”的规定，本会已会同中国人民银行总行按照上项规定分别统计清楚，兹特正式公布全国人民武器捐款的情况如下：
    一、截至去年十二月底（即十二月三十一日止）由全国各省市人民银行汇解总会的武器捐款，总计人民币五万零二百四十六亿八千七百七十九万六千五百二十一元，以每架战斗机值十五亿元计，可折合三千三百四十九架余。
    二、上项捐款总数若按大行政区分：华东地区为第一位，计人民币一万九千九百八十一亿八千零零四万五千四百四十四元，占总捐款数百分之三十九点七六，折合战斗机一千三百三十二点二架。中南地区为第二位，计合人民币一万一千零二十五亿二千零十四万六千六百九十元，占总捐款数百分之二十一点九四，折合战斗机七百三十五架。华北地区为第三位，计人民币六千八百三十三亿六千四百五十四万四千零九十一元，占总捐款数百分之十三点六，折合战斗机四百五十五点六架。东北地区为第四位，计人民币五千六百三十亿零一千八百五十五万一千六百二十二元，占总捐款数百分之十一点二一，折合战斗机三百七十五点三架。西南地区为第五位，计人民币四千二百一十九亿零零六十万一千六百一十六元，占总捐款数百分之八点四，折合战斗机二百八十一点二架。西北地区为第六位，计人民币二千一百二十八亿七千三百六十八万三千八百八十三元，占总捐款数百分之四点二四，折合战斗机一百四十一点九架。内蒙地区为第七位，计人民币四百二十八亿三千零二十二万三千一百七十五元，占总捐款数百分之零点八五，折合战斗机二十八点五架。
    三、上项捐款业经本会悉数解交中国人民志愿军领导机关收讫，购置飞机，并开有收据存于本会备查。
    四、上项捐款数目是仅按去年十二月底（即十二月三十一日止）中国人民银行总行业已收到并已解交本会的款项数目统计的，并不包括今年一月一日以后全国人民继续或补行捐献以及中国人民银行业已收到并已转本会的款项数目。此项继续或补行捐献的款项数目，希各大行政区于最近完全停止后在报上按照过去规定再公布一次，总会亦将于汇集此项捐款齐全后，再正式公布一次，以备全国人民查考。
    五、上项所公布的捐款数目，各地人民银行和各抗美援朝总分会、分会应详细核查一次，如有错误应立即分别电告中国人民银行总行或抗美援朝总会，以便检查。此外全国所有机关团体或任何一个人，如发现或怀疑本会及各级分会和中国人民银行总行及各级分行的任何人，有对武器捐款进行任何舞弊或贪污的情事，应即大胆告发。如因此而发现重大案情，本会将给检举人以重大奖励。
