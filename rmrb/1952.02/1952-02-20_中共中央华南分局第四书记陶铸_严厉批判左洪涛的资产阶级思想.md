Tao Zhu, Fourth Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's South China Sub-Bureau, delivered a speech at the Party Representative Conference of Organizations Directly Under the Guangdong Provincial People's Government on February 2nd, analyzing the severity of the errors of Zuo Hongtao, a Communist Party member and Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the General Office of the Provincial People's Government. He said: The nature of Zuo Hongtao's errors is extremely serious. This is not merely a matter of his ambiguous stance and failure to distinguish between friend and foe, nor is it simply a case of general extravagance, personal indulgence, and corruption, or so-called "bureaucratism" and "warlordism" as he himself claims. Rather, it is the very prominent manifestation of his own complete set of bourgeois ideas and style of work. During his tenure in the Provincial People's Government, Zuo Hongtao's actions were thoroughly bourgeois, stemming from his personal pursuit of enjoyment. In his work, he did not follow the Party's and the working class's line, but instead followed his own bourgeois ideological line of personal enjoyment. Take his extravagance and wastefulness, for example. His primary concern was to put on a "show." For instance, in constructing buildings, because the "appearance" was not "grand" enough, he built and demolished, and demolished and built again, wasting a great deal of manpower and materials. He also built very beautiful dance halls and swimming pools. He insisted on buying all-new furniture, discarding perfectly usable old furniture, including a batch of more than six hundred steel chairs, all of which were purchased from Hong Kong. In short, everything had to be "beautiful," "impressive," "the best," and even "foreign." Under this mindset, he spent money like water, sparing no expense. For example, he bought a batch of dining tables worth one million yuan each, spent 300 million yuan to buy a movie projector from Hong Kong, spent 5 million yuan to buy a piano, spent more than 20 million yuan to buy a billiards table, and also bought a batch of swimsuits and other items from Hong Kong. The total cost, including the unnecessary expenses incurred during construction, amounted to more than 3 billion yuan. In addition, he hired five "famous chefs" from Hong Kong at a monthly cost of several million yuan, solely to cater to the meals of a few people. Last year alone, he held more than fifty dances, with sugar alone costing more than 15 million yuan. Zuo Hongtao's personal overspending was also substantial. This huge amount of extravagance and waste is beyond ordinary comparison. "Grand" houses, swimming pools, dance halls, foreign furniture, foreign billiards tables, foreign pianos, foreign cosmetics – isn't this a complete set of comprador-bourgeois enjoyment? Isn't this a business undertaken to serve his personal enjoyment?

Tao Zhu said: Of course, we are not opposed to living in good, large houses, playing billiards, swimming, or playing the piano. Having these things does not necessarily make someone a bourgeois. But today, what Zuo Hongtao has done is excessive, exceeding the proper limits and striving to emulate the bourgeoisie. Of course, in the future, when our social production conditions are in place and our living standards have improved, we will do the same, and perhaps even better. But the problem is that today, we have just achieved victory. When the whole province and the whole country are facing a multitude of tasks to be undertaken, is it right that having a house to live in is not enough, and we must build beautiful, grand, and luxurious ones? That having furniture is not enough, and we must buy new, foreign ones? That urgent matters are not attended to, and all our energy is used to handle those things that should not be handled, those things that emphasize extravagance and enjoyment? Should we do this? Do we need to do this? Does the working class need to do this? Does the peasant class need to do this? Does the people's government under the leadership of the working class need to do this? No! Only the exploiting and selfish bourgeoisie needs to do this. In other words, only someone like Zuo Hongtao, with a complete set of bourgeois ideas, would be so willful as to do this in order to realize bourgeois-style enjoyment. Many upright people have offered him their opinions, but he has not accepted them.

Tao Zhu said: The approximately 3 billion yuan that Zuo Hongtao personally embezzled and wasted for his own enjoyment is roughly equivalent to the total annual income of ten thousand peasants in Guangdong. If used for industrial construction, it could buy the complete equipment for one thousand spindles. If used for water conservancy construction, it could build a fairly large-scale water gate. From this, it can be seen that this is simply an unforgivable crime against the people! It is said that during last year's People's Representative Conference, a peasant representative asked about the price of a foreign chair and was shocked to learn that it cost 300,000 yuan each! Because one chair was equivalent to the yield of one mu of land for a year. The total value of six hundred chairs could buy ten five-inch caliber water pumps to irrigate 3,900 mu of paddy fields, or buy 180 head of cattle to cultivate 14,000 mu of land. Zuo Hongtao would scold such voices from the peasants as "rural viewpoints" (he often scolded those who criticized his wastefulness as having "rural viewpoints"). What is wrong with such "rural viewpoints"? Compared with Zuo Hongtao's landlord, comprador, and feudal bureaucratic viewpoints, they are infinitely better!

Tao Zhu said: Zuo Hongtao's actions over the past two years have completely exposed that his entire way of thinking is that of the landlord and bourgeoisie. He spends his entire day busy with dancing, entertaining guests, and putting on a show. He adopts an extremely incorrect and insulting attitude towards female comrades, while being completely unplanned and uncaring about proper work, putting on an air of bureaucracy. He has an extreme admiration for foreign goods, and even the cigarettes he smokes and the candies he eats are foreign. What kind of thinking is this? It can only be called a foreign slave mentality. It is not to say that it is bad to use foreign goods in general, or that it is to be a foreign slave. But if you have your own things and do not use them, and instead buy from others, and not just one or two items, but a whole set of foreign goods, then that is a great mistake. The same goes for other issues. Is "beauty" good? Are "grandeur" and "the best" good? They are not bad. We are carrying out the revolution so that humanity can live "the best," live "grandly," and dress "beautifully." The question is when and how to achieve this goal. If we do not build the country well first, and improve the people's lives, and instead are obsessed with such ideas regardless of everything else, then not only will such a goal never be achieved, but the revolution will immediately head towards failure. And for someone like Zuo Hongtao to actually pursue his personal enjoyment under such a guise is truly abominable!

Tao Zhu said: Our struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a fierce class struggle. Why is it a class struggle? Because corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are dirty things that our pure working class would never have. They come from the exploiting and selfish bourgeoisie, who constantly use corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to lure us, infect us, and erode us. This kind of seduction, infection, and erosion is a special method of combat, which Chairman Mao calls "sugar-coated bullets." Some of us often do not take precautions and are knocked down. Therefore, we must recognize that this is a fierce class struggle to repel the bourgeoisie's attack on us. This struggle is related to the future of the country, that is, whether it can be built into an industrial country and move towards a socialist society. It is related to the question of who leads whom, that is, whether the leadership of the working class can be guaranteed, and therefore it is also a major issue that determines the victory of the entire revolution.

Tao Zhu said: Since entering the city, bourgeois ideology has been surging towards us like a tide. Many of our Communist Party members and responsible cadres have been contaminated to varying degrees, and some have even been swept away. This is something that deserves our vigilance. The bourgeoisie's methods of attacking us are very rampant and very vicious. One is to send them in, infiltrate our economic departments to seize economic leadership; the other is to pull them out, drag our cadres down. Without exception, all those who have been dragged down are those who first admire and pursue the bourgeois lifestyle in their thinking. However, Zuo Hongtao is a bit special; he was brought in. In the past, he contracted many bourgeois ideas and styles of work, and he brought these styles into the Party as a whole. After entering the city, his actions became fully apparent. However, what deserves our attention even more is that there are quite a few people who have learned from Zuo Hongtao. For example, in Jiangmen, a small city with a population of 60,000, there is a mayor named Luo Zhemin, who is a veteran cadre who has been tempered by a long revolutionary war. However, he has been severely eroded by bourgeois ideology. In managing and building the city, he has followed the bourgeois line and become a prisoner of the bourgeoisie. In Jiangmen, he is not enthusiastic about anything else. He does not manage land reform, nor is he enthusiastic about democratic reform. He is wholeheartedly engaged in his own set of bourgeois-style "grand construction" plans. There is also the former Mayor of Shantou, Xie Yucai, who, in order to welcome a certain bourgeois representative, did not hesitate to demolish more than 140 houses to build a road. This is also a concrete manifestation of a thorough bourgeois viewpoint. From this, it can be seen how deep and widespread the serious erosion of the bourgeoisie is! Every Communist Party member must be vigilant and actively participate in this struggle. Comrades Ye Jianying and Fang Fang often say that Guangdong is particularly severely affected by imperialism and the bourgeoisie, and that we must be particularly vigilant. This is by no means an empty phrase. From the serious problems exposed in our Party, organs, troops, and even mass organizations, and from the actions of Zuo Hongtao and Luo Zhemin, we can understand the serious significance of this statement.

    中共中央华南分局第四书记陶铸
    严厉批判左洪涛的资产阶级思想
    中共中央华南分局第四书记陶铸二月二日在中共广东省人民政府直属机关党代表会议上讲话，分析了共产党员、省人民政府副秘书长兼办公厅主任左洪涛的错误的严重性。他说：左洪涛的错误性质是非常严重的。这不仅仅是他的立场模糊、敌我不分，也不仅是一般的铺张浪费，个人享乐腐化或者像他自己所说的什么“官僚主义”、“军阀主义”等问题，而是他个人的一套完整的资产阶级思想作风表现得非常突出。左洪涛在省人民政府任职期内所做的事情，彻头彻尾都是资产阶级的一套，是从个人的生活享受出发的。在工作方面，他没有依据党的、工人阶级的路线进行，而是依据了他自己的一套资产阶级的个人享受的思想路线来进行的。拿他的铺张浪费这一点来说，他首先注意的是要讲“排场”。如修建房子，因为“观瞻”不够“堂皇”，竟修了又拆，拆了又修，浪费不少人力物力；又修建很漂亮的跳舞厅、游泳池。家具要买全新的，原来可用的都不要，其中一批六百多张钢椅子，全部都是从香港买回来的。总之，一切都要讲“美观”，讲“气派”，都要“顶好的”，甚至都要“外国货”。在这种想法之下，于是一掷千金，在所不惜。如买了一批每张价值一百万元的餐桌，花三亿元从香港买了架电影机，花五百万元买了架钢琴，花两千多万元买了副弹子球台，还从香港买了一批游泳衣以及其他东西，全部购置费连修建中所不应当花的共约三十多亿元。此外，每月用几百万元工资从香港请来了五个“名厨师”，只负责供应几个人的伙食。去年一年内举行了五十多次跳舞会，仅糖果一项，就支出了一千五百多万元。左洪涛个人的超支数目也很大。这一大堆的铺张浪费，不是一般情况可以比拟的。“堂皇”的房子、游泳池、跳舞厅、外国家具、外国弹子球台、外国钢琴、外国化妆品，这不是一整套的买办资产阶级式的享受吗？这不是为服从他个人的享受目的而兴办的事业吗？
    陶铸说：当然，我们并不反对住好的大房子，玩玩弹子球，游游水，或弹弹钢琴。有了这些东西也不能说就是资产阶级。但今天左洪涛所做的太过分了，超出了应有的范围，极力向资产阶级看齐。当然将来我们的社会生产条件具备了，生活水平提高了，我们还要这样做，甚至做得比这样还要好得多。但问题在今天，我们刚刚取得胜利。全省全国百事待举的时候，有了房子住还不够，要修建漂亮的、堂皇富丽的，有了家具不用，要买新的、外国的，急办的事情不办，而用全部精力去办那些不应办的，办那些讲排场讲享受的事。我们是否应该这样做呢？我们是否需要这样办呢？工人阶级需要这样办吗？农民阶级需要这样办吗？工人阶级领导下的人民政府需要这样办吗？不是的！只有剥削自私的资产阶级才需要这样办，也就是说，只有像左洪涛这样的带有一套完整的资产阶级思想的人，为实现资产阶级式的享受才一意孤行地这样办的。很多正派的人都向他提出了意见，他都没有接受。
    陶铸说：左洪涛个人假公济私，为了遂行他享受的目的而浪费了的约三十亿元，约等于广东一万个农民一年收入的总和；拿来建设工业，可以买一千个纱锭的全部设备；拿来建设水利，可以筑成一座相当规模的水闸。由此看来，这简直就是对人民的一种不能饶恕的犯罪行为了！据说去年开各界人民代表会议时，有位农民代表问一把外国椅子的价钱，听说是每把三十万块钱，把他吓坏了！因为一把椅子等于他一亩田一年的收获。六百张椅子的总值，就可以买到十部五寸口径的抽水机来灌溉三千九百亩稻田，或买到一百八十头耕牛，可耕作一万四千亩的田地。左洪涛对这样的农民的声音，会骂它是“农村观点”的（他常常骂批评他浪费的人是“农村观点”）。这样的“农村观点”有什么不好？比起左洪涛的地主的、买办的、封建官僚的观点来，真不知要好多少倍！
    陶铸说：左洪涛两年来的所作所为，完全暴露出他的一套思想方法是地主、资产阶级的思想方法。他整天所忙的是跳舞、请客、摆排场这一类事，他对女同志是采取极端不正确的侮辱态度，而对正当的工作就漫无计划，不管不理，拿出一套官僚主义的气派来。他对外国货极端崇拜，甚至他个人平时所抽的香烟、吃的糖果都喜欢外国货。这样的思想叫做什么思想？只能叫它是洋奴思想。并不是说大凡用外国货都是不好的，或者说就是洋奴，但自己有的不用，要向别人买，而且不止买一两件，全套都要外国货，这就是大大的过错了。其他的问题也是这样，“漂亮”好不好？“堂皇”、“顶好的”好不好？都不坏。我们进行革命就是为了人类能够生活得“顶好”，住得“堂皇”，穿得“漂亮”。问题是什么时候，和怎样才能达到这个目的。如果不把国家建设好，首先把人民生活提高，就不顾一切地醉心于这么一套想法，那么这样的目的不但永远不会达到，而且革命立刻就要走向失败，而像左洪涛那样，竟在这样的名义下去遂行他个人的生活享受，那真是太可恶了！
    陶铸说：我们的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，实质上是一场激烈的阶级斗争。为什么说是阶级斗争呢？因为贪污、浪费、官僚主义这些肮脏的东西，我们纯洁的工人阶级是不会有的。这是从剥削自私，损人利己的资产阶级那里来的，资产阶级经常拿贪污、浪费、官僚主义这些东西来诱惑我们，传染我们，侵蚀我们。这种诱惑、传染、侵蚀就是一种特殊的战斗方法，毛主席叫它做“糖衣炮弹”。我们有些人往往不知防备以致被打倒了。所以，我们必须认识，这是一场激烈的、打退资产阶级向我们进攻的阶级斗争。这个斗争关系到国家的前途的问题，即能否建设成为一个工业国，走向社会主义社会的问题，它关系到谁领导谁的问题，即是能否保证工人阶级的领导问题，因而也是决定整个革命胜利的大问题。
    陶铸说：入城以来，资产阶级的思想像狂潮似地向我们冲击过来。我们很多共产党员，负责干部都或多或少地沾染了一些，有的甚至被冲倒了，这是很值得我们警惕的。资产阶级向我们进攻的方法是很猖狂、很毒辣的。一种是派进来，打进我们的经济部门中来夺取经济上的领导权；一种是拉出去，把我们的干部拉下水。凡是被拉下水的，都没有例外地一定是首先在思想上崇拜和追求资产阶级生活方式的人，不过左洪涛有点特别，他是带进来的。他过去沾染了许多资产阶级的思想作风，又把这些作风一整套地带到党内来，入城以后做起事来，就表现得淋漓尽致。不过更要值得我们注意的是，跟左洪涛学的人并不少。如像江门这样一个六万人口的小城市，就有一个市长叫罗哲民的，他是一个经过长期革命战争锻炼的老干部，可是受到资产阶级思想的严重侵蚀，在管理城市建设城市上，都按资产阶级的路线进行，成了资产阶级的俘虏。他在江门别的事都不热心去办，土地改革他不去管，民主改革也不热心，他一心只去搞他的一套资产阶级式的“大建设”计划。还有前汕头市长谢育才，为着欢迎某资产阶级代表，竟不惜拆毁一百四十多间民房来修马路。这也是彻头彻尾的资产阶级观点的具体表现。由此可见，资产阶级的严重侵蚀，是多么深入，多么普遍！我们每个共产党员都要提高警惕，积极参加这个斗争。叶剑英同志、方方同志常常说，广东受帝国主义和资产阶级的影响特别严重，要我们特别提高警惕，这决不是一句空话。从我们党、机关、部队以至群众团体等所暴露出来的严重问题上看，从左洪涛、罗哲民这些人的行为上看，就可以知道这句话的严重意义了。（新华社）
