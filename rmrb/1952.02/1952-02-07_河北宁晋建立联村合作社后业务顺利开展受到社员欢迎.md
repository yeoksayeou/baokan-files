    Editor Comrade: After the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Ningjin County, Hebei Province, implemented the policy of merging and establishing joint village cooperatives centered on market towns, it concentrated and fully utilized human, material, and financial resources, and various businesses have been developing smoothly. The joint village cooperatives, according to the needs of members and under possible conditions, organize processing businesses, trying to achieve local purchase and sales, which not only reduces commodity prices but also guarantees the supply of materials. For example, in the Sixth District, the four village cooperatives of Xiaoliu Village were merged into one joint village cooperative, which opened a sesame oil mill. The quality of the finished product is good and the price is low, fully meeting the requirements of the members. After the merger of village cooperatives in various parts of this county, they have also added sales departments and distribution points according to needs, and members feel that the goods are complete and it is convenient to buy things. In order to further develop business and serve the members, the joint village cooperatives also implemented the method of delivering goods to the door. For example, the joint village cooperatives of Sujiazhuang and Dayangjiazhuang in the Fifth District, and Gaozhuangkou and Xiaoliu Village in the Sixth District, can deliver goods to the countryside on time. Most of the joint village cooperatives also use handcarts to deliver goods to the door, supplying the items needed by the members. Members who do not have cash can also exchange goods, which everyone finds very convenient.

    河北宁晋建立联村合作社后业务顺利开展受到社员欢迎
    编辑同志：河北省宁晋县供销合作社贯彻以集镇为中心合并建立联村合作社的方针以后，集中并充分地运用了人力、物力和财力，各种业务顺利地开展起来。联村合作社根据社员需要，并在可能条件下，举办加工业务，尽量做到原地购销，不但降低了商品价格，同时也保证了物资的供应。如六区小刘村四个村社合并成一个联村社，开办了香油磨房，成品的质量又好，价钱又低，充分满足了社员的要求。这个县的各地村社在合并以后，又根据需要增设了门市部和分销处，社员感到货全，买东西方便。为了更进一步开展业务，为社员服务，联村社还实行送货上门的办法。如五区苏家庄、大杨家庄，六区的高庄窠、小刘村等联村社，都能按期送货下乡。大部分联村社还用手推车送货上门，供给社员需要的物品。社员没有现款的，还可以拿物品来交换，大家感到很便利。  赵增霖
