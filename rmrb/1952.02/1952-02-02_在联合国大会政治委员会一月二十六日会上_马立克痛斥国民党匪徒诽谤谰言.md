Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 27th: At the morning session of the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee on January 26th, the agent of the Kuomintang clique made a shameless slanderous speech against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, acting on instructions from Washington for the committee's consideration.

With the help of its supporters, the American delegation forced this provocative slander onto the agenda of the General Assembly. Its sole purpose was to use the United Nations platform to slander the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and to divert the world's attention from the United States' aggression in the Far East and the threat of American imperialists to the People's Republic of China.

The agent of the Kuomintang clique, who illegally occupied the seat that should belong to the People's Republic of China, gave a disgustingly tedious speech, presenting all kinds of absurd lies and vile slanders. When he began to speak, at least thirty national delegations were absent. The public gallery and the press gallery were empty. Some of the representatives present were reading newspapers, some were talking to each other, and people were constantly leaving the half-empty meeting hall, because they had already heard this Kuomintang element's provocative lies at the previous two UN General Assembly sessions.

The Deputy Head of the Soviet Delegation, Malik, spoke last at the meeting, exposing the untenability of this vile slander, instigated by the American government and the Kuomintang clique it supports, and exposing the provocative nature of these slanders.

Malik said that this was the third time that the Kuomintang's slander had been forced upon the United Nations General Assembly for consideration. Discussions on this slander at the previous two sessions of the General Assembly had already shown that it was absolutely unfounded and provocative in nature. It had been fully proven at that time that the basis of this accusation was nothing but lies and slanders.

As early as the fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly, this slander was submitted to the so-called Interim Committee for consideration due to pressure from the American delegation. However, this so-called Interim Committee was unable to present a single word in support of this slander at the fifth General Assembly and this session. This once again shows that the Kuomintang's slander is untenable and its unreasonable nature.

However, this meaningless issue continues to be on the agenda of the General Assembly.

We may ask: Why is this? It is no accident that the Kuomintang slanderers and their American masters are so preoccupied with this slanderous lies. They want to mislead public opinion and make it seem as if the collapse of the Chinese Kuomintang regime was caused by foreign interference in China's internal affairs, rather than the bankruptcy of this thoroughly corrupt regime and its overthrow by the Chinese people.

At previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation and some other delegations have presented many irrefutable facts that have undoubtedly proven that the Kuomintang regime collapsed and was overthrown because it was met with angry opposition from the entire Chinese nation. The masters of the Kuomintang clique, the American political leaders, also admit this. This is proof.

For example, the United States Secretary of State Acheson described the Kuomintang clique as an unreliable group, a group that had lost all the trust of the Chinese people.

On March 15, 1950, Acheson gave a speech in San Francisco, in which he discussed the reasons for the Kuomintang clique's failure. At that time, he said that the Kuomintang government (Acheson used this name to call the Kuomintang clique) was not overthrown by force, but collapsed on its own because of its inherent weaknesses and loss of popular support.

Recently, former United States Secretary of Defense General Marshall also confirmed this. As everyone knows, he is a well-known expert on Chinese affairs. He once led a special American mission to China, whose task was to consolidate the Kuomintang clique and maintain Kuomintang rule.

Speaking to the Senate Committee on May 12, 1951, he pointed out that the main reason for the collapse of the Chinese Kuomintang army was that the army did not receive the support of the people, which meant that the soldiers in the army were also dissatisfied with the government's actions and had no confidence in the government. This greatly weakened their fighting will, and coupled with the corruption and incompetence of their leaders, their combat effectiveness became extremely limited.

These opinions of American political leaders once again confirm that the Kuomintang clique was overthrown by the Chinese people because of its complete political and moral bankruptcy and its complete loss of popular support.

In their slander, the Kuomintang elements insist that the Soviet Union violated the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed on August 14, 1945. The absurdity of this statement is obvious to everyone. Just as the name of the government used by the Kuomintang elements when they put forward this slander does not exist, the treaty they mentioned also does not exist. This treaty has been abolished by China itself, represented by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on February 14, 1950.

When this Sino-Soviet treaty was signed, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai exchanged notes, declaring the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945 and the attached agreements.

This is the actual situation of this dead treaty that the Kuomintang clique's representative is talking about here.

That is to say, a speaker of a non-existent government who is illegally occupying the seat that should belong to China is putting forward a slander, fabricating a story to say that the Soviet Union violated a treaty that no longer exists, but someone is trying to force the United Nations General Assembly to consider this slander.

When talking about the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japanese militarists, the Kuomintang clique spread despicable lies in an attempt to diminish the role played by the Soviet Union in this war.

We do not intend to discuss this issue with these slanderers; we only need to present one fact: United States Secretary of State Acheson recently, just last year, admitted when the Senate Military Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee heard the so-called MacArthur case that the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan on the one hand and the Soviet army's participation in the war against Japanese imperialism on the other hand enabled the United States to lose more than one million American soldiers and officers less.

Any serious person who thinks about this official statement by the United States Secretary of State will surely understand that the Kuomintang clique's representative is lying and slandering on this issue.

The Kuomintang elements spread lies that the Soviet Union has expansionist ambitions towards China. This absurd and ridiculous statement has been completely refuted by the facts. The Soviet government—whose foreign policy has always been based on respecting the independence and sovereignty of other countries—has established friendly relations with the People's Republic of China, and this relationship has been solidified by the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance of February 14, 1950.

At the signing ceremony of the Sino-Soviet treaty, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky pointed out in his speech that this treaty demonstrates the wish of the Chinese and Soviet peoples "for the permanent friendship and cooperation of our two countries, and for the peace and security of all peoples." He also pointed out that this treaty and the attached agreements "are a most important contribution to the cause of consolidating world peace and democracy."

At this signing ceremony, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in his speech that the close and sincere cooperation between China and the Soviet Union—a cooperation manifested in the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet treaty and the attached agreements—"is of extremely far-reaching historical significance, and will inevitably have a major impact and result on the cause of peace and justice for mankind in the East and the world." Since the signing of the above-mentioned treaty, the development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples has fully confirmed the evaluation of the role and significance of this treaty by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and China at the time of signing.

The increasingly consolidated friendship established between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China most clearly shows that the Kuomintang elements' ridiculous slander that the Soviet Union threatens China's political independence and its sacred and inviolable territory is completely absurd.

However, the threat to China's political independence and sacred and inviolable territory does exist, but this threat is not created by the Soviet Union, but by the United States. As everyone knows, the United States has been pursuing a policy of aggression and imperialist enslavement against China for more than a hundred years, and has consistently interfered in China's internal struggles.

After the end of World War II, in order to achieve the long-term goal of enslaving China and turning China into a colony and military bridgehead, the United States government provided a great deal of assistance to the Kuomintang elements to oppose China's national liberation movement.

The American army directly participated in this struggle in China. American officers sat in the headquarters of the Kuomintang and directed the formulation and execution of plans to fight against the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

After the Chinese people and their heroic People's Liberation Army defeated the combined forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialists, the American ruling group did not abandon their plans to enslave China.

Simultaneously with the invasion of Korea, the United States, under the personal order of Truman, also occupied China's Taiwan Island, turning it into an American military base.

The American Air Force is systematically attacking the territory of the People's Republic of China. Just recently, on January 25, newspapers published a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Andong saying:

"American planes continue to invade our northeastern airspace to bomb. At 7:00 PM on the 19th, an enemy plane invaded the territory of Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, and dropped seven bombs in Maxian Gou, destroying three civilian houses and injuring three oxen and one horse. At 2:00 PM on the 20th, an enemy plane invaded our territory 10 kilometers from the direction of Biktong, Korea. At 9:00 AM on the 21st, 19 enemy planes invaded Siping Street, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province for reconnaissance; on the same day, another batch of 8 enemy planes invaded the airspace of Andong City, Liaodong Province, and were repelled by our anti-aircraft artillery units."

This is the most convincing evidence of who is threatening China, who is violating China's airspace, and who is dropping murderous bombs on China's peaceful cities and villages.

The January 26th newspaper carried news about an agreement reached between Truman and Churchill on the possibility of American air force attacks on Chinese territory.

Gentlemen of the First Committee, this is the source of the threat to China's political independence and territorial integrity! The Kuomintang elements' slander is intended to smear the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in order to cover up this threat from the United States of America to China.

The American authorities systematically organize a wide range of espionage and sabotage networks in China. For example, the documentary materials and confessions obtained during the trial of the espionage case in Beijing in August 1951 confirmed this. These secret agents, under the instruction of American Colonel Bowrede, carried out espionage and terrorist activities in the People's Republic of China, conspiring to launch armed riots and assassinate the leaders of the Chinese People's Government. This hostile and aggressive policy of the American government towards the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people is clearly a threat to China's political independence and territorial integrity.

The ridiculous slander now proposed by the First Committee for discussion, instigated by the American government and its lackey Kuomintang bandits, is merely an attempt to divert attention from the continuing acts of American aggression in the Far East, from the policy pursued by the American government, and from the policy of hostility and animosity towards the Chinese people and the free and independent Chinese state.

However, this is not the only purpose of those who organize and direct the Kuomintang elements to carry out slander. They are also spreading this slanderous lies at this session of the United Nations General Assembly in order to divert attention from the issue of the United States legislature's passage of the universally despised "1951 Act," which allocated $100 million for subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

In the course of discussing this "law," the Soviet delegation and some other delegations have fully exposed and pointed out the true intentions of the American government towards the people's democratic countries. In American policy, subversive and destructive activities, the work of organizing and funding armed groups hostile to these countries, has replaced diplomacy. The discussion of this issue at the Sixth United Nations General Assembly also showed that the American government violated the Soviet-American agreement, which was still signed by President Roosevelt, which stipulated that they should not interfere in each other's internal affairs and should not organize armed groups with the intention of being hostile to the other party. This agreement has been violated by the American government. This act of sabotage has been condemned and considered an aggressive act to further complicate and worsen international relations. Now everyone has understood: By passing such laws, the American government has exposed itself as an enemy of peace and a betrayer of its obligations, because it has undermined the internationally recognized norms of international law in international relations. Diverting attention from the American government's violation of its international obligations, especially the international obligations directly and indisputably undertaken due to the aforementioned Soviet-American agreement, is the second task of the Kuomintang elements' slanderous lies. This is the situation regarding the Kuomintang elements' slanderous lies, and this is why they have put forward and spread this slanderous lies at this session of the General Assembly.

However, the Kuomintang elements cannot represent China, and therefore have no right to raise any questions in the United Nations organization. This slanderous lies and his slanderous words are not worthy of any serious attention. His extensive talk about this slanderous lies is clearly for provocative and aggressive purposes.

Gentlemen of the First Committee, now is the time to stop this political deception. The General Assembly and its First Committee, if they allow the Kuomintang elements to carry out slander, will make themselves tools in the hands of slanderers, adventurers, and aggressors, thereby losing their prestige.

Due to the above-mentioned circumstances, the Soviet delegation firmly requests that the discussion of this provocative slander by the Kuomintang elements be stopped.

The meeting adjourned after Malik finished speaking.

### 在联合国大会政治委员会一月二十六日会上  马立克痛斥国民党匪徒诽谤谰言

    在联合国大会政治委员会一月二十六日会上  
    马立克痛斥国民党匪徒诽谤谰言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎二十七日电：在联合国大会政治委员会一月二十六日的上午会议上，国民党集团的代理人就他奉华盛顿的指示而提交委员会考虑的对苏联和中华人民共和国的无耻诽谤发言。
    美国代表团在它的支持者的帮助之下，硬把这件挑衅性的诽谤在大会上提出，其唯一的目的便是要利用联合国讲坛来对苏联和中华人民共和国进行诽谤，并转移全世界的注意力，使全世界不注意美国在远东的侵略以及美帝国主义者对中华人民共和国的威胁。
    非法地盘据着本应属于中华人民共和国的席位的国民党集团代理人令人生厌地絮絮不休的发言，提出种种荒唐的谎言和卑劣的诽谤。当他开始发言时，至少有三十个国家的代表团没有出席。公众席和新闻记者席空无一人。在场的代表有些在看报，有些在彼此交谈，不时还有人离开已有半数席位空着的会议厅，因为他们早已在上两届联合国大会会议上听过这一位国民党分子的种种挑衅谰言了。
    苏联代表团副团长马立克在会上最后发言，揭露了这种由美国政府和它所豢养的国民党集团授意的劣卑的诽谤谰言是站不住脚的，并揭露了这些谰言的挑衅性质。
    马立克说，硬要提出国民党的诽谤来由联合国大会考虑，这已经是第三次了。大会上两届会议对这个诽谤的讨论，已经表明了它是绝对没有根据的，表明了它的挑衅性质。当时已经完全证明，这控告的根据只是一些谎话和诽谤。
    早在第四届联合国大会的时候，就由于美国代表团的压力，这个诽谤被提交所谓临时委员会考虑。可是，这所谓临时委员会在第五届大会和本届大会上都不能提出一个字来支持这种诽谤。这就再一次表明国民党的诽谤站不住脚，表明它的蛮不讲理的性质。
    然而，这个没有意义的问题仍然继续列在大会议程上面。
    我们可以问问：这是为了什么呢？国民党诽谤者和他们的美国主子因为他们这种诽谤谰言而忙得不可开交，那实在不是偶然的。他们要想迷惑舆论，想要把事情说成好像中国国民党政权的崩溃是由于外国干涉中国内政而造成的，而不是因为这个彻头彻尾腐败的政权的破产，不是因为这政权被中国人民所推翻。
    在以前几届联合国大会上，苏联代表团以及其他某些代表团已经提出许多无可争辩的事实，无可怀疑地证明了，国民党政权之所以垮台和被推翻，是因为它遭到整个中国民族的愤怒反对。国民党集团的主子们、美国政治领袖们也承认了这一点。这就是证明。
    例如，美国国务卿艾奇逊把国民党集团形容为不能相信的集团，形容为丧失了中国人民一切信任的集团。
    一九五○年三月十五日，艾奇逊在旧金山发表演说，曾谈到国民党集团失败的原因。当时他说，国民党政府（艾奇逊用这个名字来叫国民党集团）并不是被武力推翻的，它是因为它有内在的弱点和丧失了人民的支持而自己崩溃的。
    最近，前美国国防部长马歇尔将军也证实了这一点。大家知道，他是有名的中国问题专家，他从前率领过美国驻华特别使团，其任务是巩固国民党集团，维持国民党统治。
    他在一九五一年五月十二日在参院委员会发言中谈到中国国民党军队崩溃的原因时指出，主要的原因是军队没有获得人民的支持，这意思就是说军队里的士兵也不满政府的行动，对于政府没有信心，这样就大大的削弱了他们的战斗意志，再加上他们的领袖们的腐败无能，他们的战斗力就变得极端有限了。
    美国政治领袖这些意见再一次证实了，国民党集团是因为政治上和道义上的彻底破产以及完完全全丧失民心，而被中国人民推翻的。
    国民党分子在他们的诽谤中硬说苏联破坏了一九四五年八月十四日签订的中苏条约。这种说法的荒唐可笑是人人都可以明白看到的，正象国民党分子提出这个诽谤时所用的政府名义并不存在一样，他们提到的这个条约也已不存在了。这个条约已由中国自己废除，代表中国这样做的是中华人民共和国中央人民政府，它在一九五○年二月十四日与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府缔结了中苏友好同盟互助条约。
    在签订这项苏中条约时，苏联外交部长维辛斯基和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来互换照会，宣告废除一九四五年八月十四日的苏中条约以及附带的协定。
    国民党集团的代表在这里谈论的这个死条约的实际情形便是这样。
    这就是说，一个在这里非法地盘据着本应属于中国的席位的并不存在的政府的发言人提出一项诽谤，无中生有地说苏联破坏已经不存在的条约，而却有人企图迫使联合国大会考虑这个诽谤。
    国民党集团代理人谈到苏联参加对日本军国主义者的战争时，散布了卑鄙的谰言，企图缩小苏联在这个战争中所起的作用。
    我们不打算和这些诽谤者们讨论这个问题；我们只要提出一个事实就够了：美国国务卿艾奇逊最近，只不过是去年，在参院军事委员会和外交委员会听取所谓麦克阿瑟案时承认，苏联在联合国一面参加对日作战，苏联军队参加对日本帝国主义的战争，使美国得以少损失一百万多名美国士兵和军官的生命。
    任何严肃的人只要想一想美国国务卿这个官方的声明，就一定会明白国民党集团代理人在这问题上是说谎和诽谤了。
    国民党分子散布谰言说苏联对中国有扩张主义野心。这个荒谬可笑的说法已经完全被事实所驳倒。苏联政府——它的外交政策向来都是以尊重他国的独立和主权为基础的——已经和中华人民共和国建立了友好关系，这种关系已经以一九五○年二月十四日的友好同盟互助条约固定下来。
    在苏中条约的签字式上，苏联外交部长维辛斯基发言指出，这个条约表现了中苏两国人民“对于我们两个国家的永久的友好与合作，以及对于各国人民的和平与安全所抱的愿望”。他并且指出，这个条约和附带的各项协定“对于巩固全世界的和平与民主的事业，是一个最重大的贡献”。
    在这个签字式上，中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来在发言中说，中国和苏联间的亲密真诚合作——这种合作表现在苏中条约以及附带各项协定的缔订——“是具有极其深长的历史意义的，而对于东方与世界的人类和平与正义的事业，将不可免地形成重大的影响和结果”。自从上述条约签订以来，苏中两国人民友谊合作的发展已完全证实了苏中两国外交部长在签约时对这条约的作用和意义的估价。
    苏联与中华人民共和国之间建立的友谊日益巩固，这就最明白地表明了：国民党分子说什么苏联威胁中国的政治独立及其神圣不可侵犯的领土的可笑诽谤是完全荒谬的。
    但是，对中国政治独立和神圣不可侵犯的领土的威胁确实是存在的，不过这威胁不是苏联造成的，而是美国造成的。谁都知道，一百多年以来美国一直奉行着对中国进行侵略和实行帝国主义奴役的政策，一贯干涉中国的国内斗争。
    在第二次世界大战结束之后，为了达到奴役中国和把中国变成殖民地和军事桥头堡的长远目的，美国政府大量帮助国民党分子反对中国的民族解放运动。
    美国军队直接参加了中国国内的这种斗争。美国军官坐在国民党的总部里，指挥对中国人民解放军作战计划的制订和执行工作。
    在中国人民和他们的英雄的人民解放军击溃了国民党反动派和美帝国主义者的联合力量以后，美国统治集团并没有放弃他们奴役中国的计划。
    与侵略朝鲜的同时，美国还在杜鲁门亲自命令下，占领了中国的台湾岛，把它变成美国的军事基地。
    美国空军正在有计划地袭击中华人民共和国的领土。就在最近，一月二十五日，报纸还刊载了新华通讯社的安东消息说：
    “美国飞机继续侵入我东北领空轰炸。十九日下午七时，敌机一架侵入我辽东省辑安县境，在麻线沟投弹七枚，炸毁民房三间，炸伤耕牛三头及马一匹。二十日下午二时，敌机一架由朝鲜碧潼方向侵入我国境十公里。二十一日上午九时，敌机十九架，侵入我辽东省宽甸县四平街进行侦察；同日另批敌机八架侵入我辽东省安东市上空，被我高射炮部队击退。”
    这是最有说服力的证据，说明了谁威胁中国，谁侵犯中国领空，谁向中国的和平城市和村庄投下杀人的炸弹。
    一月二十六日的报纸刊载了关于杜鲁门和邱吉尔就美国空军袭击中国领土的可能性取得协议的消息。
    第一委员会的代表先生们，这就是威胁中国政治独立和领土完整的根源！国民党分子的诽谤是要中伤苏联和中华人民共和国，是为了掩饰美利坚合众国对中国的这种威胁。
    美国当局有计划地在中国组织广泛的间谍破坏网。譬如一九五一年八月在北京举行特务间谍案审判时所获得的文件性材料和口供，就证实了这件事。这些特务间谍在美国包瑞德上校的指使下，在中华人民共和国内进行间谍恐怖活动，阴谋武装暴动和谋杀中国人民政府的领袖们。美国政府这种敌视中华人民共和国和中国人民的侵略政策，分明是对中国的政治独立和领土完整的威胁。
    在美国政府及其仆从国民党匪帮指使下现在建议第一委员会讨论的可笑的诽谤谰言，只不过是企图转移视线，使舆论不注意美国在远东继续进行的侵略行为，不注意美国政府所奉行的政策、对中国人民和自由独立的中国国家采取敌对和仇视态度的政策。
    但是，这并不是组织和指使国民党分子进行诽谤的人的唯一目的。他们在这届联合国大会上散布这种诽谤谰言，还为了转移视线，使人不注意美国立法机关通过举世唾弃的“一九五一年法”、拨款一亿美元进行反对苏联和人民民主国家的颠覆破坏活动的问题。
    在讨论这个“法律”的过程中，苏联代表团和一些其他代表团已经完全揭露了、指出了美国政府对人民民主国家的真正图谋。在美国的政策中，颠覆破坏活动、组织和资助敌视这些国家的武装团体的工作，代替了外交。在第六届联合国大会上对这个问题进行的讨论，也表明美国政府破坏了还是由罗斯福总统签订的苏美协定，这个协定规定不得干涉彼此的内政，不得组织怀有敌视对方的目的的武装团体。这个协定已被美国政府破坏了。这种破坏行为已受到谴责，被人认为是为了使国际关系进一步复杂化和恶化的侵略行为。现在任何人都已经明白：由于通过这种法律，美国政府已暴露出自己是和平的敌人，也是它所承担的义务的背弃者，因为它破坏了在国际关系上举世公认的国际法准则。转移视线，使人不注意美国政府破坏它所承担的国际义务，特别是因上述苏美协定而直接地无可争辩地承担的国际义务的这种行为，是国民党分子散布诽谤谰言的第二个任务。这就是关于国民党分子诽谤谰言的情形，这就是他们为什么在这届大会上提出和散布这种诽谤谰言的原因。
    但是，国民党分子并不能代表中国，因此没有任何权利在联合国组织中提出任何问题，他提出的这种诽谤谰言和他的诬蔑之词，都不值得任何认真的注意。他把这种诽谤谰言大谈一通，显然是为了挑衅和侵略的目的。
    第一委员会的代表先生们，现在已是制止这种政治欺骗行为的时候了。大会和它的第一委员会，要是让国民党分子进行诽谤，就要使本身变成诽谤分子、冒险分子、侵略者手中的工具，从而丧失自己的威信。
    由于上面所说的这些情形，苏联代表团坚决要求停止讨论国民党分子的这种挑衅性的诽谤。
    马立克发言完毕后，即行休会。
