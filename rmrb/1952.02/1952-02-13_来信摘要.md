Ma, District Chief of the Fourth District of Yutai County, Pingyuan Province Should Not Make Disaster Victims Travel Back and Forth in Vain Twice

Ma Jichao, District Chief of the Fourth District of Yutai County, Pingyuan Province, is careless and irresponsible in his work planning. Last September, disaster victims in various villages of the Fourth District of Yutai County received a notice from the district government to collect relief grain, so they organized fifty carts to go. As a result, they waited for a long time and did not see the grain. Later, the district chief came out and announced that the grain had not yet arrived, and asked everyone to go back and come another day. This was simply a great waste. Last October, the Yutai County People's Government organized the masses to transport grain in order to support disaster victims in production. Later, due to rain and the rush to plant wheat, it was decided at a meeting of the district chiefs to temporarily stop the transportation. The district chiefs immediately returned to their districts to notify the masses of this matter, but District Chief Ma went home for the night after the meeting and did not notify the masses in time. Therefore, on October 23, 150 carts from the Fourth District made a wasted trip, affecting the masses' ability to rush to plant wheat in a timely manner. It is hoped that District Chief Ma will conduct a self-criticism.

Eliminate Pro-American Thought in Sports Books

Some sports books published by the Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore, mostly introduce sports from capitalist countries such as the United States, Germany, and Switzerland. The "Latest Basketball Basic Training Illustrated" (compiled by Wu Zhiren, professor of Dongya Sports College), which was revised and republished in April 1951, is a typical example of this type of book. When introducing various basketball training methods, this illustration almost always uses the "experience" of teams such as the "All-American Basketball Team," "New Yorkers," and "Sir Dukes" or their players to "prove" each action, which is actually spreading pro-American thought.

The people's sports cause in the Soviet Union is very developed, and there are many outstanding achievements. However, the sports books published by this bookstore that I have seen do not mention the Soviet Union's sports experience at all.

I believe that Qinfen Bookstore should check and deal with these books to avoid harming readers. Hu Shuangbao

Books Published in Installments Should Be Published in Order

I feel that there is a bad practice in the publishing industry, that is, when a set of books is published in installments, they are not published in sequential order. For example, a set of "Political Economy Tutorial" published by Sanlian Bookstore, a total of sixteen installments, is not in sequential order. So far, the fourth installment and the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth installments have not been published. Another example is a set of "Historical Materialism" published by the People's Publishing House, which first published the third chapter. This may be beneficial for publishers, that is, printing the installments that are first completed and translated can speed up capital turnover; but it is inconvenient for readers. How can we continue to read if we have Volumes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, but are missing Volume 4 in the middle? This is even more inconvenient for us who work in libraries.

I think this practice should be corrected. Ding Yun

Publishing Houses Should Establish and Strengthen Editorial Review Work

According to the report made by Zhang Chunqiao, Deputy Director of the East China News Publishing Bureau last November, only 9.2% of Shanghai's publishing houses have editorial departments (even including special editors). Although this is an incomplete statistic, I think it deserves serious attention. Because if publishing houses do not have editorial departments, that is, there are no dedicated editors and reviewers, and they still publish books, it would be purely accidental if the books did not contain errors.

In order to eliminate errors and improve the quality of publications, I suggest that all publishing houses quickly establish and strengthen the organization of editorial departments, and formulate a sound inspection system to conduct regular inspections of their publications. Huan Yun

Magazines Should Not Use Too Good Paper for Wrappers

We feel that the magazine publishers of "World Knowledge," "Study," "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," "China Youth," etc., use too good wrapping paper when sending magazines, which is a waste. For example, "China Youth" is sent wrapped in heavy-weight newsprint. Using poorer paper would save a lot. We suggest that they use waste newspaper as wrapping paper to implement the method of conservation.

Organizing Study Groups is a Good Method for Teaching

The experience of theoretical study for cadres on the job in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province in 1951 shows that study groups are a good organization for teaching when there are few teachers and low levels of students. There are two forms of study groups in Taiyuan City, one is organized jointly by study guides, and the other is organized jointly by teachers. Their main tasks are to lecture, select reference books, answer questions, and study and improve learning methods. The study groups of the Ordnance Bureau and the Chemical Plant also did work such as compiling lecture outlines, drawing maps, and preparing vocabulary lists, which played a great role in promoting learning. This organizational form can give play to the wisdom of the masses, collectively solve problems, and make the leadership of learning concrete and in-depth; closely connect teachers and study guides, cadres, and collect everyone's opinions at any time to improve learning methods; initially overcome the difficulties of teachers, and train teachers in practice.

Organizing Cattle Mutual Aid is a Good Way to Solve the Difficulties of Households Lacking Cattle

Organizing cattle mutual aid in the new district can make up for the lack of cattle. The successful experience of organizing cattle mutual aid in Gaoduqiao Village, Liufu Township, Xuancheng County, Southern Anhui Province proves this point. In previous years, households with cattle and households without cattle were not organized, and it was very difficult for households without cattle to rent cattle, which affected production. Last autumn, in order to achieve the goal of increasing production, the village farmers' association held a symposium to discuss the use of cattle, and everyone decided to organize cattle mutual aid groups. The method is to adopt the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. The mutual aid group assesses the number of cultivated land that each cattle should bear according to its physical strength, and then the cattle owner finds his own renters. The rent is 20 to 30 catties of rice per mu per year, which can also be repaid with labor. The mutual aid group elected an old farmer to be responsible for guiding cattle use technology and mediating possible disputes, and formulated cattle mutual aid measures. After this, the autumn plowing in the village proceeded smoothly, and there was no more shortage of cattle. Zhu Laizhi

    来信摘要
    平原鱼台县第四区马区长  不应两次使灾民徒劳往返
    平原省鱼台县第四区区长马继超对工作计划不周，不负责任。去年九月，鱼台县四区各村灾民接到区政府通知去领救济粮，就组织了五十辆车前往，结果等了半天没见粮食。后来区长才出来宣布说，粮食还没运到，叫大家回去改日再来。这简直是很大的浪费。去年十月，鱼台县人民政府为了扶助灾民生产，组织群众运粮。后来因下了雨抢种麦子，经各区区长开会决定暂时不运了。对这件事，各区长当即返区通知，只有马区长在开完会后，又回家住了一宿，没有及时通知群众。因此，十月二十三日那天，四区有一百五十辆车空跑了一趟，影响了群众及时抢种麦子。希望马区长检讨。

    清除体育书籍中的崇美思想
    上海勤奋书局出版的一些介绍外国体育的书籍，多是介绍美国、德国、瑞士等资本主义国家的体育。一九五一年四月修订后再版的“最新篮球基本训练图解”（东亚体育专科学校教授吴之仁编），是这一类书籍的典型。这一图解介绍各种篮球练习方法时，几乎每个动作都要用“全美篮球队”、“纽约客”、“西尔的克士”之类的球队或它们的队员的“经验”来“证明”，这实际上就是散布崇美思想。
    苏联的人民体育事业很发达，而且有许多卓越成绩。但我所看到的这个书店出版的体育书籍，对苏联的体育经验却只字未提。
    我认为勤奋书局应该对这些书籍进行检查和处理，以免贻害读者。胡双宝
    分册的成套书籍应按次序出版
    我感觉出版界有一个不好的作法，就是一套书分册出版的时候，不按先后次序出版。如：三联书店出版的一套“政治经济学教程”，共十六分册，不是按次序，至今第四分册及十一、十二、十三、十四、十五等分册都还没有出版。又如人民出版社出版的一套“历史唯物论”，也是首先把第三章出版了。这样作，对于出版者来说，可能有些好处，就是把首先作好、译好的分册印出来，可以加速资金周转；但是对于读者来说，是不方便的。请问：一、二、三、五、六册都有，中间缺少第四册，怎样读下去呢？对于我们作图书馆工作的，更加不便。
    我认为这种作法是应该纠正的。丁云
    出版社应建立和加强编审工作
    根据华东新闻出版局张春桥副局长去年十一月的报告，上海各出版社有编辑部的仅占百分之九·二
    （连特约编辑都已计算在内）。这虽是不完全的统计，但我认为已值得严重注意的了。因为各出版社如果没有编辑部，也就是说没有专门的编审人员，而还要出书，书籍如不发生错误，那真是太偶然了。
    为了消灭错误，提高出版物的质量，我建议各出版社迅速建立和加强编辑部的组织，并制定一种完善的检查制度，以对自己的出版物进行经常的检查。奂匀
    寄送杂志不应用太好的纸作包皮
    我们觉得“世界知识”、“学习”、“争取持久和平、争取人民民主”、“中国青年”等杂志社，寄送杂志时使用的包皮纸，都太好了，这是一种浪费。如“中国青年”是用重磅白报纸封寄的，用差一些的纸，就会节省许多。我们建议他们最好用废报纸作包皮，实行节约的办法。

    组织研究小组是进行教学的好方法
    山西省太原市一九五一年在职干部理论学习的经验说明，研究小组是在教员少、学员水平低的情况下进行教学的一种良好的组织。太原市的研究小组有两种组织形式，一种是由学习指导员联合组织的，一种是由教员联合组织的。其主要任务是讲课、选择参考书、解答问题和研究改进学习方法等。兵工局、化工厂的研究小组还做了编讲课提纲、绘地图、拟制生字表等工作，对于推动学习，起了很大的作用。这种组织形式，能发挥群众智慧，集体解决问题，使学习的领导得以具体深入；密切教员和学习指导员、干部间的联系，随时搜集大家意见，改进学习方法；初步克服了教员的困难，并在实践中培养了教员。向健
    组织耕牛互助是解决缺牛户困难的好办法
    在新区组织耕牛互助可以弥补耕牛的不足。皖南宣城县刘福乡高渡桥村组织耕牛互助的成功经验证明了这点。在往年，有牛户和无牛户没有组织起来，无牛户很不容易租到牛，这样，就使生产受到影响。去年秋耕时，这村农会为了达到增产目的，召开座谈会讨论耕牛使用办法，大家决定组织耕牛互助组。办法是采取自愿两利原则，由互助组按每头耕牛体力评定它应负担耕地数，然后由牛主自找对象出租，租金每年每亩二十斤到三十斤稻子，用人工抵还也可。互助组推选一个老农民负责指导用牛技术和调解可能发生的纠纷，并订出了耕牛互助办法。这以后，村中秋耕顺利进行，没有再闹牛荒。朱来志
