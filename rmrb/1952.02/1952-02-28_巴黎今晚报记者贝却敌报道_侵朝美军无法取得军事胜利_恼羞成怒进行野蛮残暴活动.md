Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: Paris Tonight reporter Pierre Béguin reported from Kaesong on the 25th: The hideous face of the American side in Korea is becoming more and more like that of the Nazis. The American military newspaper "Stars and Stripes" arrogantly announced with a headline that the "Wolfhound" regiment carried out the massacre on Geoje Island. On the same day, the newspaper published news that the U.S. side was buying German police dogs in Germany at a price of eighty-three U.S. dollars each for use in Korea. The Nazi stormtroopers used this kind of Alsatian wolfhound in the infamous murderous concentration camps. The activities carried out by the American side in Korea are becoming more and more barbaric, obviously because they are frustrated and enraged by their failure to achieve a military victory. The U.S. Navy arrogantly stated three days ago that their pilots had used napalm bombs to "completely destroy" a new building city west of Panmunjom. We can see this city burning in the conference area. This city is located quite far west of Panmunjom, where there has been almost no military activity for several months, and even the American representatives in the conference tent admitted several months ago that there was no military activity there. The U.S. side claimed on the 24th that the Australian Air Force had "completely destroyed" the village of Tandong-ri in northern Korea. The pilot is said to have said: "We have turned that place into rubble. They will have no bed to sleep on tonight." Although the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention prohibit such inhumane destruction, the U.S. side encourages such destruction here every day and treats it as a new type of terror tactic.

    侵朝美军无法取得军事胜利
    恼羞成怒进行野蛮残暴活动
    【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌二十五日自开城报道：美方在朝鲜表现的狰狞面目一天比一天更象纳粹了。美国军队办的《星条报》骄横地用头号大标题宣布“猎狼犬”团进行了这次巨济岛上的屠杀。同一天的该报刊登了美方在德国以每头八十三美元的价格购买德国警犬准备在朝鲜使用的消息。纳粹冲锋队员在臭名远扬的杀人的集中营里所使用的就是这种阿尔萨斯猎狼犬。美方在朝鲜进行的活动一天比一天野蛮，这显然是由于他们没有能够取得军事胜利而恼羞成怒的缘故。美国海军在三天以前傲慢地说，他们的飞行员已用凝固汽油弹把板门店以西的一座新建筑的城市“炸得精光”。我们在会场区可以看到这个城市在燃烧。这个城市位于板门店以西相当远的地方，那里若干月以来几乎没有军事活动，连在会议帐篷里的美方代表在若干月前也承认那里没有军事活动。美方在二十四日声称，澳大利亚空军已“完全摧毁”朝鲜北部的炭洞里那个村庄。据说驾驶员曾说：“我们已使那个地方成为一片瓦砾。他们今天晚上无床可睡了。”尽管海牙公约和日内瓦公约禁止进行这种惨无人道的破坏，美方却天天在这里鼓励这种破坏，把它当作新式恐怖战术。
