    Yuhua Cigarette Factory Manager Wei Jinchi
    Actually Treats the Anti-Corruption Struggle with a Perfunctory Attitude
    Comrade Editor: Wei Jinchi, manager of the state-owned Yuhua Cigarette Factory in Huangchuan County, Henan Province, adopts a passive and perfunctory attitude towards the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Wei Jinchi's daily life is undisciplined, and he likes to eat and drink extravagantly. He often gives away three or five cartons of the factory's cigarettes, and he also spent 280,000 yuan of public funds to buy mosquito nets. He also does not cherish public property. The factory's electric wires were black, and he thought they were unsightly, so he replaced them with red ones, spending two to three million yuan. He has serious bureaucratic work style, and the workers are all afraid of him. Last year, the factory lost some paper, and without investigation, he groundlessly fired two workers. In order to respond to the call for increased production and conservation, the workers volunteered to work on Sundays without rest and donate the money from the increased production, but he disagreed, saying: "It is okay not to take a holiday, but donation is not allowed." He takes a completely negative attitude towards this movement. He led a few people to casually and perfunctorily check each department, and talked about some trivial waste phenomena. He did not mention his own problems at all. After four days of perfunctory inspection, the movement was considered complete. He even said:
    "Our factory's democratic reform has not been long, and there is a democratic foundation." He used this to cover up his bureaucracy. Technician Wang Xianzhi made suggestions to him at the beginning of the movement, and he immediately fired him on a pretext. I request the department in charge of the factory to pay attention to this issue and send someone to the factory to mobilize the masses to do a good job in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    裕华烟厂经理韦金池
    竟以应付态度对待反贪污斗争
    编辑同志：河南潢川县公营裕华烟厂经理韦金池，以消极应付态度对待反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，韦金池平日生活不检点，喜欢大吃大喝。他经常拿公家烟三条五条的送人，还拿公款二十八万元买了帐子。他也不爱惜公家财产。该厂电灯线是黑皮线，他认为不好看，把它换上红皮线，花了二、三百万元。他有严重的官僚主义作风，工人们都怕他。去年，该厂丢了盘纸，他不经过检查，就无故开除了两个工人。工人们为了响应增产节约的号召，自愿在星期日不休息，把加工增产的钱捐献出来，但他不同意，说：“不休假可以，捐献却不能。”他对这次运动，完全抱着消极态度。他率领几个人到各部门草率随便地查了一下，说了些鸡毛蒜皮的浪费现象。他一点不提自己的问题。经过四天的敷衍检查，运动就算进行完了。他甚至说：
    “咱厂民主改革不久，有民主的基础。”以此来掩饰他的官僚主义。技师王先芝在运动开始时对他提了意见，他立即借故把他开除。我要求领导该厂的部门重视这一个问题，派人来厂发动群众搞好反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。吴志有
