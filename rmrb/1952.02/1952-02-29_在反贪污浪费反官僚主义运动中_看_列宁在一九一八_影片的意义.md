    Reader's Letter

    To the Editor: I watched the film "Lenin in 1918" during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. This film has been very enlightening to me. It specifically educated us to learn from the working methods and style of the great teacher of mankind, to stand firm, and to bravely and resolutely repel the frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie. The anti-corruption struggle is a serious and fierce revolutionary struggle. We cannot show any "mercy" to the enemy, and we should always be vigilant to prevent the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage. A kind of non-political, sympathetic heart lies hidden in some intellectuals, and this kind of thinking often endangers the interests of the revolution and the broad masses of people. After watching the film "Lenin in 1918," I realized that even Gorky once had this kind of erroneous thinking. How careful we should be! Lenin gave us a clear instruction: no matter how brutal and stubborn the enemy is, we must win! We should accept the instructions given to us by the great teacher. There is also a moving scene in the film, in which Vasily transported 80,000 poods of grain from Tsaritsyn to Moscow, but he himself went hungry until he fainted. This spirit of integrity and devotion to public service is worthy of our learning. Vasily set an example for us.

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中
    看“列宁在一九一八”影片的意义
    编辑同志：我在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，看了“列宁在一九一八”的影片。这部影片对我的启发作用很大。它具体地教育了我们学习人类伟大导师的工作方法和作风，站稳立场，勇敢地、坚决地打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。反贪污斗争是一场严重的剧烈的革命斗争，我们不能对敌人讲一点“仁慈”，应当时时刻刻提高警惕，防止敌人的阴谋和破坏。在个别知识分子中潜藏着一种没有政治立场的怜悯心，这种思想情绪往往危害了革命和广大人民的利益。我看了“列宁在一九一八”影片，才知道连高尔基也曾经有过这种错误思想。我们应该如何小心啊！列宁给我们一个明确的指示：不管敌人如何凶残和顽强，我们一定要胜利！应该接受伟大导师给我们的训示。影片中还有一个令人感动的镜头，是华西里从察里津运到莫斯科八万普特粮食，但他自己却饿着肚子，直到昏厥过去。这种廉洁奉公的精神是值得我们学习的。华西里给我们树立了一个榜样。  葛敏
