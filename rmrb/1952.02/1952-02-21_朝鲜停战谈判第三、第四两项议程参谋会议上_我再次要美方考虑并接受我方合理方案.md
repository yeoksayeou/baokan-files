Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th -- At the staff meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 20th, our side again requested the other side to consider and accept our completely reasonable solution of a monthly rotation limit of 30,000 people and four designated ports for each side, and to withdraw its unjustified opposition to the neutral nations proposed by our side.

Since the staff meeting on the fourth item began on February 7, our side has consistently tried its best to adopt all the opinions of the other side that could be adopted. On February 14, our side put forward an amendment to our proposal of February 3, and on February 18, we put forward wording amendments to some clauses of the February 14 amendment. At today's meeting, our side once again, based on recent discussions between the two sides, put forward amended wording of various clauses of our proposal. Our staff pointed out that our proposal is a sufficient and complete solution to the fourth item on the agenda; only if the other party removes the artificial obstacle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" created by its own hand and accepts our fair and reasonable proposal, can the meeting progress and the fourth item on the agenda be resolved.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三、第四两项议程参谋会议上
    我再次要美方考虑并接受我方合理方案
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方再次要求对方考虑并接受我方所提出的每月三万人的轮换限额和每方四个特定口岸的完全合理的解决方案，并撤回其对我方所提出的中立国的毫无理由的反对。
    第四项议程参谋会议自二月七日开始以来，我方一贯尽量采纳了对方的一切可予采纳的意见。在二月十四日，我方提出了对我方二月三日提案的修正案，在二月十八日，又对十四日的修正案中若干款提出了措辞方面的修正。今天会议上，我方又一次根据双方最近的讨论，提出我方提案各款的修正措辞。我方参谋人员指出：我方的提案，是解决第四项议程的充分的完整的方案；只有对方移去其一手所制造的所谓“自愿遣送”的人为障碍，接受我方公平合理的提案，会议方能进展，第四项议程方能获得解决。
