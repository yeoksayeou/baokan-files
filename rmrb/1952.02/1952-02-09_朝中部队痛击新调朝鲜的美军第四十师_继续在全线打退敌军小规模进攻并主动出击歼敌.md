Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 8th: Our frontline correspondent reports: The US invading army's 40th Infantry Division has, following the 45th Infantry Division, recently been transferred from Japan to fight in Korea. It is the second new infantry division that the US aggressors have added to their military strength in Korea during the period of delaying the armistice negotiations.

Like the US invading army's 45th Infantry Division, the 40th Infantry Division was immediately struck by our army upon entering battle and began to suffer casualties in large numbers. Late at night on January 31, a platoon of the 40th Division, entrenched on an unnamed highland southeast of Kimhwa, was suddenly attacked by a small unit of our army, and most of the enemy were annihilated. The next morning, a part of the division attempted to intrude upon a hilltop northeast of Kimhwa but was forced to flee after being hit by our artillery fire and suffering many casualties.

In recent days, the climate in Korea has been severely cold. While continuing to repel small-scale enemy attacks on all fronts, the Korean and Chinese People's Army has actively launched attacks with small units, annihilating the enemy. On the afternoon of the 4th, a unit of our army counterattacked the enemy forces on an unnamed highland northwest of Gaoyangdai, west of Lianchuan. In just eight minutes of battle, they completely annihilated an reinforced platoon of the 2nd Battalion, 15th Regiment, 3rd Division of the US invading army defending the position.

    朝中部队痛击新调朝鲜的美军第四十师
    继续在全线打退敌军小规模进攻并主动出击歼敌
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略军第四十步兵师已继第四十五步兵师之后，在最近自日本调到朝鲜作战。它是美国侵略者在拖延停战谈判期中增加在朝军事力量的第二个新的步兵师。
    美国侵略军第四十步兵师和第四十五步兵师一样，刚被投入战斗就遭到我军的打击，并开始成批成批地伤亡。一月三十一日深夜，盘据在金城东南一个无名高地上的四十师的一个排遭到我军一支人数很少的部队的突然袭击，敌人大部被歼。次日晨，该师一部向金城东北一个山头窜犯，被我炮火杀伤多人后逃去。
    近日朝鲜气候严寒，朝中人民军队一面继续在全线打退敌军小规模进攻，一面以小部队主动出击，歼灭敌人。四日下午，我军一部反击涟川以西高阳岱西北一个无名高地上的敌军，仅八分钟的战斗，即将守敌美国侵略军第三师第十五团二营的一个加强排全部歼灭。
