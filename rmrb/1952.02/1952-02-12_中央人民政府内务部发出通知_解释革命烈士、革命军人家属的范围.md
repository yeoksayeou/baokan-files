The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government Issues a Notice Explaining the Scope of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Military Personnel

Recently, there have been different interpretations of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary military personnel in various regions, causing dissatisfaction among some revolutionary martyrs' families and families of revolutionary military personnel. To this end, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a notice stating:

Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Military Personnel: "The term 'families of revolutionary military personnel' in these regulations refers to direct relatives, spouses, and siblings under the age of sixteen who live with the military personnel and are dependent on the military personnel for their livelihood, or other relatives who were raised by the military personnel since childhood and now must rely on the military personnel for their livelihood." In some places, the implementation has been limited to the provisions listed in the articles for revolutionary martyrs' families and families of revolutionary military personnel, and no others can be called family members. Some collateral or non-cohabiting relatives of revolutionary military personnel, especially revolutionary martyrs, are dissatisfied, some saying, "We were implicated during the White Terror, and now we can't even get a bit of the glory," etc. The following explanations are provided:

Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Military Personnel stipulates the scope of preferential treatment for families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary military personnel, not the "family law." The so-called direct relatives and spouses who live together, needless to say, rely on the livelihood of revolutionary military personnel, and the siblings under the age of sixteen and other relatives who have raised revolutionary military personnel have added the words "must rely on the livelihood of military personnel." It is clear that it is about the scope of preferential treatment, not the scope of family members. Does it mean that uncles and aunts who do not live together are not considered uncles and aunts, and siblings over the age of sixteen are not considered siblings? Of course not.

Regarding the issue of preferential treatment, material preferential treatment—such as cultivating land on behalf of the family and providing living subsidies—can only be limited to relatives who rely on the livelihood of revolutionary military personnel, as listed in the regulations. Regarding political preferential treatment, Article 6, Item 8 of the Preferential Treatment Regulations stipulates congratulatory celebrations, hanging honorary plaques, condolences on important festivals, and setting up seats for martyrs' and military families at meetings. There is no doubt that direct relatives should accept this honor. However, when one person performs meritorious service, the whole family is glorious, and the collateral relatives and other relatives of the revolutionary military personnel are also glorious. If there is no one left in the revolutionary martyr's family or the revolutionary military personnel has no direct relatives, it is also appropriate for their collateral relatives to accept the honorary plaque and condolences.

### 中央人民政府内务部发出通知  解释革命烈士、革命军人家属的范围

    中央人民政府内务部发出通知
    解释革命烈士、革命军人家属的范围
    近来各地对于革命烈士、革命军人家属说法各有不同，以致使某些革命烈士家属、革命军人家属不大满意。为此中央人民政府内务部特发出通知称：
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属优待暂行条例第三条：“本条例所称革命军人家属系与军人同居之直系血亲、配偶及依靠军人生活之十六岁以下的弟妹，或军人自幼曾依靠其抚养长大现在又必须依靠军人生活的其他亲属。”某些地方在执行中发生对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，只限于条文所列，此外不得称为家属；而有些革命军人的尤其是革命烈士的旁系或不同居的亲属不服，有的说：“我们在白色恐怖时受过株连，现在连光荣都沾不到一点”等。兹说明于下：
    革命烈士、革命军人家属优待暂行条例第三条，是规定对革命烈士、革命军人家属优待的范围，而不是规定“亲属法”。所谓同居的直系血亲、配偶，不待说是倚靠革命军人生活的，十六岁以下的弟妹及曾扶养革命军人的其他亲属，都加了“须倚靠军人生活”字样。很明显是说优待范围，而不是说家属范围。难道不同居的伯叔就不算伯叔，超过十六岁的弟妹就不算弟妹吗？当然不是。
    关于优待问题，物质优待——代耕土地和发给生活补助费等，只能限于依靠革命军人生活如条例上所列举的亲属。关于政治优待，优待条例第六条第八项规定的贺功贺喜，挂光荣匾，重要节日慰问，开会设烈、军属席等，也毫无疑问接受这种荣誉的应是直系亲属。但一人立功，全家光荣，革命军人的旁系亲属及其他亲属同样也是光荣的。假如革命烈士家已无人或革命军人本人没有直系亲属，由其旁系亲属接受光荣匾及慰问，也是适当的。
