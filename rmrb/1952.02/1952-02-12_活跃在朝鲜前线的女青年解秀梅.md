    The Young Woman Jie Xiumei, Active on the Korean Front
    After a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea, it marched continuously and arduously. When the soldiers were climbing mountains and at their most fatigued, they often saw a female comrade with two braids, limping to the front of the line, singing a clapper talk to the troops: "Today's journey is over seventy li, nothing for young men to be concerned about. Carrying fifty or sixty jin, walking like a flying leg. Tomorrow, we'll have an evaluation meeting, which comrade didn't fall behind, who helped others, we'll record it in the merit book." The soldiers, looking at her energetic movements and enthusiastic face, were unwilling to fall behind, and secretly quickened their pace. This female comrade is named Jie Xiumei, and she is a member of the cultural troupe of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. She is not only a propaganda and mobilization worker loved by the soldiers, but also a model of unity and fraternity. During marches, she always put the backpacks, rice bags, and other things of others on her shoulders. She signed "package and parts" contracts with comrades who were physically weak, ensuring that she would bring their things to the campsite. When she arrived at the campsite, she rarely rested, often mending socks and boiling water for the comrades to soak their feet, so that the comrades could walk comfortably and reduce fatigue. She helped the kitchen squad collect firewood and cook, which moved the cooks to say, "If a woman comrade can overcome difficulties, we cannot fall behind either."
    Later, the superiors assigned Jie Xiumei to work in the battlefield surgery clinic as a nurse for the wounded. On the afternoon of November 30th last year, Jie Xiumei was returning from collecting firewood in the mountains when four enemy planes were bombing at low altitude. The ward was hit. She remembered that there was still a wounded soldier who had not been transferred, so she jumped into the room regardless of everything, put out the fire on the wounded soldier's body, and carried the wounded soldier to the mountains. At this time, the enemy planes became even more frantic, and bombs exploded one after another beside her. When Jie Xiumei carried the wounded soldier fifty meters away, a bomb was dropped directly on their heads. She stopped alertly, put the wounded soldier down, and laid her whole body on the wounded soldier to prevent him from being injured. The bomb exploded nearby, and rubble and dirt buried them. Jie Xiumei's body was bruised and battered. She crawled out of the pile of dirt and comforted the wounded soldier, saying, "Comrade, don't worry, as long as I have a breath, I will never let you be injured a second time." She finally carried the wounded soldier safely to the air-raid shelter in the mountains.
    Jie Xiumei's selfless work spirit was praised by the wounded and encouraged the vast number of logistics staff. At the merit evaluation meeting, she was awarded the title of first-class hero and was admitted as a member of the Communist Party of China. (Attached picture)

    活跃在朝鲜前线的女青年解秀梅
    人民志愿军某部进入朝鲜后，连续艰苦行军。当战士们正在爬山和最疲劳的时候，往往看见一个扎着两只发辫的女同志，一拐一跛的跑到队伍的前面，迎着部队唱起快板：“今天路程七十多里地，年轻小伙算不了事。背的东西五六十斤，走起路来飞毛腿。明天开个评比会，那个同志没掉队，是谁互助帮别人，给他记在功劳本。”战士们看着她手舞足蹈充满活力，和那幅热情的面庞，谁也不肯落后，便暗中加紧了脚步。这个女同志名叫解秀梅，是志愿军某部的文工队员。她不仅是战士们喜爱的宣传鼓动员，还是团结友爱的模范。行军时，她总是把旁人的背包、米袋等东西放在自己的肩上。她和身体弱的同志订立“包里包件”合同，保证把她们的东西带到宿营地。每到宿营地她很少休息，经常给同志们补袜子、烧开水烫脚，让同志们走路方便，减少疲劳。她帮助伙房拣柴做饭，感动得炊事员同志说：“人家女同志都能克服困难，我们也不能落后。”
    后来，上级分配解秀梅到战地手术所做护理伤员的工作。去年十一月三十日下午，解秀梅从山上打柴回来，四架敌机正低空轰炸，病房被炸中了，她想起屋里还有一个未转走的伤员，便不顾一切地跳进屋里，扑灭了伤员身上的火，背起伤员就往山上跑。这时敌机更加疯狂，炸弹一个跟着一个地在她身旁爆炸。解秀梅背着伤员跑出五十米以外的时候，一颗炸弹直向他们的头上投下来，她机警地停住脚步，把伤员放下，全身伏在伤员的身上，免得伤员受伤。炸弹果然在近旁爆炸了，碎石碎土把他们埋起来，解秀梅的身上被砸的青一块紫一块。她从土堆里爬起来，安慰伤员说：“同志放心，只要我有一口气，决不让你负二次伤。”她终于把伤员安全地背到山上防空洞里。
    解秀梅忘我工作的精神，得到了伤员的称赞，鼓舞了广大后勤工作人员。在评功会议上，她被评为一等功臣，并被吸收为中国共产党党员。（附图片）
