    On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    East China First-Level Organs Hold Symposiums with Businessmen to Break Up the "Offensive-Defensive Alliance" of Corrupt Elements and Those Offering Bribes

    First-level organs in East China continuously held symposiums with businessmen. Internal and external cooperation, attacking corrupt elements and those offering bribes from both sides, played a significant role. After the various units held meetings with businessmen, many corrupt elements began to confess or continued to supplement their materials; the "offensive-defensive alliance" of many corrupt elements and businessmen was also broken. For example, after the Textile Administration held a meeting with businessmen, the number of those who confessed increased to 120, including those who had embezzled 150 million yuan. Wang Baoqi, a purchasing agent of the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, had confessed to some of the facts, but after the bureau held a meeting with businessmen, it caused a great shock, and he requested to supplement the materials. All the members of the repair team of the motorcade under the administrative office of the East China Bureau collectively embezzled and established an "offensive-defensive alliance" with the businessmen. After the office held a meeting with businessmen, compared the internal and external confessions and accusations, and finally broke the "offensive-defensive alliance" of the repair team.

    Experience from various units in holding symposiums with businessmen proves that preparing well before the meeting, fully mastering the information, having responsible comrades personally preside over the meeting, explaining the significance of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, clarifying policies, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, breaking the concerns of businessmen, and encouraging confession and reporting will achieve the desired results.
    Anti-Corruption Struggle Unfolds in Leagues of Inner Mongolia

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has unfolded in the leagues under its jurisdiction. On January 9, Ulanhot City held a mass meeting to struggle against major corrupt elements such as Zhang Zhonghua. On January 11, the Zhelimumeng Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the directly affiliated organs of the Meng People's Government held an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle meeting. At the meeting, everyone reported the crimes of Fei Wenhua (Communist Party member), the director of the Afforestation Bureau of the Meng People's Government, who embezzled 30 million yuan, wasted 200 million yuan, and resisted the movement. According to the demands of the masses, the Zhelimumeng Committee of the Chinese Communist Party announced on the spot the expulsion of corrupt element Fei Wenhua from the Party, and the Meng People's Government removed him from the post of Director of the Afforestation Bureau and arrested him for legal action.

    In order to promote the movement, the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first convened a meeting of party member representatives from directly affiliated organs at the beginning of this year, and invited representatives from non-party figures and mass organizations to participate. This meeting highly promoted democracy, conducted sharp criticism and exposure of the responsible persons of various organs, and reported corrupt elements.

    At present, the development of this movement in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is still uneven. In places such as Chahar League, Zhaowuda League, and Huna League, the leading cadres did not "go to the front line" to personally command, so although they initially took action, they were very weak. The Inner Mongolia Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government are vigorously correcting the above situation.
    Zhejiang Province Concentrates Efforts to Besiege Major Corrupt Elements

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Zhejiang Provincial organs has entered the stage of fiercely attacking major corrupt elements. Nine major corrupt elements have been discovered in the provincial organs. However, some major corrupt elements dare not show up. The Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Committee, and the Provincial Streamlining and Economy Committee successively convened meetings of cadres above the level of provincial department and bureau directors on January 24 and 26, deciding to adopt the method of fiercely attacking and relentlessly pursuing the lurking major corrupt elements who refuse to confess, so as to ensure that the case is solved. The meeting clearly stipulated that the work of each organ that is currently unrelated to the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be suspended. Some unfinished work in the movement, such as the criticism of bourgeois ideology, supplementary self-criticisms of certain leading cadres, and the handling of certain ideological and work style issues exposed in the movement, and those that do not become obstacles to "fighting tigers," should be postponed. Even if they are carried out, the principle is not to affect the urgent task of concentrating efforts to besiege major corrupt elements. The meeting also instructed leading cadres at all levels to reorganize the team, strengthen the weak units, and stipulated that the method of division of labor and responsibility should be adopted to direct their subordinate units within a time limit to complete the task, otherwise it would be considered dereliction of duty.
    Nanjing Uncovers 104 Corrupt Elements in Five Days

    Since January 25, various organs, enterprises, and groups in Nanjing City have concentrated their efforts to attack major corrupt elements. By January 29, in five days, 104 corrupt elements with embezzlement of more than 10 million yuan have been found, including eight major corrupt elements with embezzlement of more than 100 million yuan. In these five days, some major corrupt elements adopted various methods to resist and evade; some even pretended to be "active," refused to confess their own problems, and pretended to persuade others to confess at the struggle meeting. However, these tricks of theirs ultimately could not escape the eyes of the masses. Now the anti-corruption struggle in Nanjing has become a mass movement, and the encirclement of major corrupt elements has taken shape.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    华东一级机关召开商人座谈会打破贪污行贿分子“攻守同盟”
    华东一级机关各单位连续召开商人座谈会，对内外配合，两面夹击贪污行贿分子，起了很大作用。各单位召开商人会后，很多贪污分子纷纷开始坦白或继续补充材料；不少贪污分子和商人的“攻守同盟”也被攻破。例如纺织管理局举行商人会后，坦白人数增加到一百二十人，其中有贪污一亿五千万元的。邮电局采购员王宝祺曾坦白出一部分材料，在该局召开商人会后，震动很大，又要求补充材料。华东局行政处所属汽车队修理组全体人员集体贪污，并和商人订立了“攻守同盟”。该处在召开商人会后，根据内外坦白检举的材料加以对照，终于攻破了修理组的“攻守同盟”。
    由各单位召开商人座谈会的经验证明：会前做好准备工作，充分掌握资料，并由负责同志亲自主持会议，说明反贪污行贿运动的意义，讲明政策，晓以利害，打破商人顾虑，鼓励坦白、检举，就会收到预期的效果。
    内蒙古各盟反贪污斗争展开
    内蒙古自治区反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已在所属各盟展开。乌兰浩特市在一月九日召开了斗争大贪污犯张仲华等的群众大会。中共哲里木盟党委和盟人民政府直属机关在一月十一日召开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争大会。会上，大家检举了该盟人民政府造林局局长费文华（共产党员）贪污三千万元、浪费两亿元并抗拒运动的罪行。根据群众要求，中共哲里木盟党委当场宣布开除贪污犯费文华的党籍，盟人民政府撤销其造林局长职务，并加以逮捕法办。
    为了推动运动，中共中央内蒙古分局今年年初首先召开了直属机关党员代表会议，并邀请党外人士代表和群众团体的代表参加。这次会议高度发扬了民主，对各机关负责人进行了尖锐的批评和揭发，检举了贪污分子。
    目前内蒙古自治区这一运动的发展还是不平衡的。察哈尔盟、昭乌达盟、呼纳盟等地由于领导干部未“上前线”亲自指挥，虽然初步行动起来，但很没有力量。中共中央内蒙古分局和内蒙古自治区人民政府对上述情况正大力纠正中。
    浙江省集中力量围攻大贪污犯
    浙江省级机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已进入猛攻大贪污犯的阶段。省级机关已发现大贪污犯九名。但是还有一部分大贪污犯不敢露面。省府、省委及省精简节约委员会分别在一月二十四、二十六日连续召开省级处、局长以上的干部会议，决定对潜伏着的拒绝坦白的大贪污犯，采取猛打穷追办法，务使破案。会议明确规定：各机关目前与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义无关的工作，可以暂停。运动中有些未了的工作，如对于资产阶级思想的批判、某些领导干部的补充检讨，以及运动中所暴露出来的某些思想作风问题的处理等，及不成为“打老虎”的障碍者，均应暂缓进行。即使进行，也以不影响集中力量围攻大贪污犯的紧急任务为原则。会议并责成各级领导干部重新整编队伍，增强力量薄弱的单位，并规定采取分工负责的办法，限期指挥所属单位，完成任务，否则以失职论。
    南京五天查获贪污犯百零四名
    南京市各机关、企业、团体自一月二十五日开始集中力量向大贪污犯进攻。到一月二十九日止，五天中已查获贪污一千万元以上的贪污犯一百零四名，其中贪污一亿元以上的大贪污犯共八名。在这五天中，有些大贪污犯采取各种方法顽抗、逃避；甚至有的假装“积极”，拒不坦白自己的问题，在斗争会上却假意劝别人坦白。但是他们这些伎俩，终逃不过群众的眼睛。现在南京市的反贪污斗争，已经成为群众性的运动，对大贪污犯的包围形势已经形成。
