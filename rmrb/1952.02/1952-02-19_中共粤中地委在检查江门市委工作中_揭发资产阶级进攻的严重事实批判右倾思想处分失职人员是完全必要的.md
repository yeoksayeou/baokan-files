Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. The CCP Yuezhong (Central Guangdong) District Committee recently conducted an in-depth inspection of the work of the CCP Guangdong Jiangmen Municipal Committee, exposing the serious facts of how the bourgeoisie, over the past two years, had adopted various methods to compete for the leadership of the working class. These facts prove that the right-leaning thought within the Party is extremely damaging to the Party, the country, and the interests of the people.

Jiangmen City is a prosperous commercial city with a population of 60,000. After liberation, the city's bourgeoisie (who were closely linked to feudal forces) launched an offensive to seize leadership from the working class by "sending in" and "pulling over" tactics. Those they "sent in" to become cadres in the Municipal People's Government included: He Zhi, acting deputy section chief of the Industry and Commerce Section; Yu Tan'ying, deputy section chief of the Civil Affairs Section; and Shi Pengda, deputy section chief of the Health Section and instructor at Renji Hospital. In addition, seven cadres were placed in various sections and units of the Tax Bureau. After becoming cadres in the People's Government, this group of bourgeois agents did not work under the leadership of the Party and the working class to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and promote the overall interests of the country and the people. Instead, they worked entirely for the purpose of a few illegal capitalists stealing state wealth and weakening the people's democratic dictatorship. For example, He Zhi completely followed the instructions of industrialists and businessmen in implementing industrial and commercial policies, and incited merchants to raise prices, thereby increasing exploitation of the working people. When Yu Tan'ying joined the Municipal People's Government, a certain capitalist said to him: "We sent you to work. You represent us, don't think you're participating in work as an individual." Yu Tan'ying had to submit a "written report" to him once a week, reporting the work situation of the Municipal People's Government and the market conditions of the state trading organs.

On the other hand, this group of illegal industrialists and businessmen launched a frenzied attack on revolutionary cadres with sugar-coated bullets of pleasure and profit. The city's Federation of Industry and Commerce, completely under the control of the bourgeoisie, extracted 1.8 billion yuan from the people through illegal surcharges to build the "Industry and Commerce Cultural Palace," which became a place for them to drag cadres down. During "social dances," they had the city's dancers wear uniforms to seduce cadres. Feasting, gift-giving, and bribery were widespread. Jia Zhiyong, director of the Municipal Tax Bureau, was one who was captured by them. Jia Zhiyong turned a blind eye to the tax evasion of Wen Zhiyu and Xie Nan, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and absurdly gave Wen Zhiyu the title of "Tax Protection Model." After illegal merchants captured the director of the Tax Bureau and installed informers in the bureau, they evaded a large amount of taxes. According to preliminary statistics, in 1950 alone, they evaded 50 billion yuan in national taxes. Huang Zibin, director of the secretariat and concurrently section chief of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Municipal People's Government, was also captured. In addition to promoting He Zhi to acting deputy section chief of the Industry and Commerce Section without principle, he also sent official documents to Wen Zhiyu for approval.

After the bourgeoisie's attack to seize leadership succeeded in many departments, many policies of the People's Government were completely changed in their implementation, and the interests of the working people were seriously damaged. For example, at the beginning of the land reform, the Jiangmen City's Urban-Rural Liaison Office was not an organization to mobilize urban people to support the land reform movement of peasants, but an organization to protect bullies and disrupt the peasant movement. The office was nominally led by Mayor Luo Zhemin, but the real power was in the hands of figures from the Federation of Industry and Commerce. When the peasants of Dongling Township, Xinhui County, requested the arrest of the notorious bully Zhang Wenying, they immediately notified him and helped Zhang extract 500 million yuan from the bank and flee with his family. They shouted that the peasant movement was "excessive" and said: If we don't "correct deviations," "I don't know how many businesses will be implicated and closed down." The market "clearly marked prices" movement promoted last year was completely messed up by the Federation of Industry and Commerce. They generally raised prices and took the opportunity to make illegal profits, seriously affecting the lives of the working people. In the work of unifying weights and measures, illegal capitalists changed the Sima catty (about three taels greater than the market catty) to the market catty, but did not lower prices. According to statistics for December of last year alone, the item of rice alone exploited the people of the city by 543.8 million yuan; the item of salted fish exploited the people of the city by 180 million yuan. Around the Spring Festival, the city established a Price Stabilization Committee, with Wen Zhiyu and He Zhi as its chairman and vice-chairman. They used delaying tactics to facilitate merchants in raising prices, causing all festival goods to skyrocket, rising by one-third to one time more than usual. Under the direction of Shi Pengda, Renji Hospital arbitrarily increased consultation fees and medicine costs, barring sick laborers from entering. In addition, law-abiding merchants in the city were also harmed. For example, the Federation of Industry and Commerce illegally added a 3/1000 surcharge to build the "Industry and Commerce Cultural Palace," which law-abiding merchants were extremely dissatisfied with.

The Federation of Industry and Commerce, completely under the control of the bourgeoisie, actually controlled many departments of the Municipal People's Government, turning the policies implemented by the government into something completely beneficial to the bourgeoisie and detrimental to the working people. At the same time, in many aspects, they influenced the work of the Municipal People's Government with their ideology, causing it to be carried out in a bourgeois manner. For example, the Municipal People's Government spent more than 400 million yuan to build five "foreign toilets," while only allocating several million yuan to "expand" workers' children's schools. On the other hand, within this Federation of Industry and Commerce, there were 38 affiliated trade associations, with 104 full-time staff, and monthly expenses of 167 million yuan shared by various shops. The Federation of Industry and Commerce could issue orders, arrest people, and illegally collect taxes. The leaders of the Federation of Industry and Commerce even had "guards" following them when they went out. The people of the city were extremely resentful of this Federation of Industry and Commerce.

The above facts show that the right-leaning thought of the CCP's organization in Jiangmen City has developed to a very serious degree. Luo Zhemin, first deputy secretary of the CCP Municipal Committee and mayor of the Municipal People's Government, was completely insensitive to the bourgeoisie's attack after entering the city. When capitalists shouted "Long live Mayor Luo" and praised him at capitalists' banquets, he felt very "honored"; he was completely unvigilant and indifferent to the bourgeoisie's erosion of the Party and the wrongdoing of illegal merchants. His bureaucratic style was also very serious, and he delegated day-to-day affairs to Huang Zibin, director of the secretariat and concurrently section chief of the Industry and Commerce Section. In this way, the work of Jiangmen City completely deviated from the working class, deviated from the mass line of the people, and followed the bourgeois line.

In order to resolutely correct the serious mistakes in the work of Jiangmen City, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, after removing Luo Zhemin from all his posts, also dismissed Huang Zibin, He Zhi, and Shi Pengda from their posts, ordered Tax Bureau Director Jia Zhiyong to suspend his duties and reflect, and thoroughly rectified the work of the Municipal People's Government. Under the guidance and assistance of the CCP Central Committee South China Bureau, the CCP Yuezhong District Committee has launched a struggle to criticize right-leaning thought and eliminate bourgeois corruption within the Party organization of Jiangmen City.

    中共粤中地委在检查江门市委工作中
    揭发资产阶级进攻的严重事实
    批判右倾思想处分失职人员是完全必要的
    【新华社广州十八日电】中国共产党粤中地方工作委员会最近深入检查了中共广东省江门市委员会的工作，揭发了资产阶级两年来采取各种方法来争夺工人阶级的领导权的严重事实。这些事实证明，党内的右倾思想对党对国家和对人民利益的损害极为严重。
    江门市是个六万人口的繁盛的商业城市。解放后，该市资产阶级（他们和封建势力是密切联系着的）就用“派进来”和“拉过去”的方法展开了向工人阶级争夺领导权的攻势。他们“派进来”当了市人民政府干部的有：工商科代理副科长何直、民政科副股长余镡鍈、卫生科副科长兼仁济医院指导员史鹏达，另外在税务局各科、股里安置了七个干部。这批资产阶级的代理人当了人民政府的干部后，完全不是在党和工人阶级的领导下为巩固人民民主专政和增进国家与人民整体的利益而进行工作，而是完全为了少数不法资本家盗窃国家财富和削弱人民民主专政。例如，何直在执行工商政策上完全听从工商业家的指挥，并且唆使商人抬高物价，加重对劳动人民的剥削。余镡鍈进市人民政府工作时，某资本家对他这样说：“是我们派你参加工作。你是代表我们的，不要以为是你个人参加工作。”余镡鍈每周要向他作一次“书面报告”，将市人民政府的工作情况和国家贸易机关的商情报告他们。
    另一方面，这一批不法的工商业家又以声色货利的糖衣炮弹向革命干部猖狂进攻。完全在资产阶级控制下的该市工商业联合会采取违法附加税收的方法，榨取人民十八亿元建筑了“工商界文化宫”，这就是他们拉干部下水的场所，他们使干部在那里习染了资产阶级荒淫无耻的生活方式。在开“联欢舞会”时，他们使市内的舞女改穿制服伴舞来勾引干部。请客、送礼、行贿很普遍。市税务局局长贾志勇就是被他们俘掳过去的一个。贾志勇对工商联正、副主任委员文植虞、谢南的偷税漏税行为不闻不问，还荒唐地给文植虞以“护税模范”的称号。不法商人把税务局长俘掳了过去，又在局内安置了坐探，便大量偷漏税款，据初步统计仅一九五零年即偷漏国税五百亿元。市人民政府秘书主任兼工商科科长黄子彬也是被俘掳的一个。他除了无原则地提拔何直为工商科代理副科长外，还把公文送给文植虞去批拟。
    资产阶级争夺领导权的进攻在不少部门里得手之后，人民政府的许多政策就在执行中完全变了样，劳动人民的利益受到严重损害。例如在土地改革开始时，江门市的城乡联络处完全不是发动城市人民支援农民的土地改革运动的机构，而是包庇恶霸破坏农民运动的机构。该处由市长罗哲民挂名领导，实权却由工商联的人物掌握。当新会县东凌乡农民要求逮捕大恶霸张文英时，他们立即通知并帮助张犯提取银行存款五亿元举家逃亡。他们大叫农民运动“过火”，说：如不“纠偏”，“不知连累多少商号要倒闭”。去年推行的市场“明码实价”运动，完全是由工商联去胡搞的。他们普遍抬高物价，趁此牟取非法利润，严重影响了劳动人民的生活。在统一衡器工作中，不法资本家把司马斤（大于市斤约三两）改为市斤，但没有降低价格。仅去年十二月份的统计，食米一项就剥削了全市人民五亿四千三百多万元；咸鱼一项剥削了全市人民一亿八千多万元。春节前后，该市成立了稳定物价委员会，正、副主任正是文植虞和何直两人。他们用拖延的办法来便利商人抬高物价，致使过节物品样样飞涨，比平日上涨三分之一到一倍。仁济医院在史鹏达主持下擅自提高诊金和药费，把患病的劳动者拒诸大门之外。此外该市守法的商人也受到损害。例如工商联为了建筑“工商界文化宫”违法附加税收千分之三，守法的商人对此也极为不满。
    完全在资产阶级控制下的工商联在实际上掌握了市人民政府的许多部门，使政府实施的政策变成完全有利于资产阶级而不利于劳动人民的东西，同时他们还在许多方面使市人民政府的工作在他们的思想影响下，按照资产阶级的方式来进行。例如市人民政府花了四亿多元去建筑五座“洋厕所”，而只拨几百万元去“扩充”工人子弟学校。另方面，在这个工商联里有所属的同业公会三十八个，全部脱离生产的工作人员有一百零四人，每月由各商店分担的开支共一亿六千七百万元。工商联可以发号施令，可以逮捕人民，可以非法征税。工商联的负责人出门还有“警卫员”跟着。全市人民对这个工商联均极表憎恶。
    上述这些事实，说明江门市中共党的组织的右倾思想已发展到十分严重的程度。该市中共市委会第一副书记、市人民政府市长罗哲民入城后，对资产阶级的进攻完全麻木不仁。他在参加资本家的宴会时，资本家叫喊“罗市长万岁”，为他捧场，他认为非常“荣耀”；对资产阶级对党的侵蚀和不法商人的胡作非为，完全不加警惕和过问。他的官僚主义作风也非常严重，日常事务都交给秘书主任兼工商科长黄子彬处理。这样，江门市的工作就完全脱离了工人阶级，脱离了人民群众的路线，而走了资产阶级的路线。
    为坚决纠正江门市工作的严重错误，广东省人民政府在撤销罗哲民的一切职务后，又解除了黄子彬、何直、史鹏达的职务，命令税务局长贾志勇停职反省，对市人民政府的工作进行彻底整顿。在中共中央华南分局指示和帮助下，中共粤中地方工作委员会已在江门市的党组织内展开批判右倾思想和肃清资产阶级腐蚀的斗争。
