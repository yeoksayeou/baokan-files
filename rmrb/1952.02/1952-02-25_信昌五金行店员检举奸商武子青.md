    Shop Assistants of Xinchang Hardware Store Expose the Unscrupulous Merchant Wu Ziqing
    To the Editorial Board: Wu Ziqing, the manager of Xinchang Hardware Store, has consistently bribed cadres and embezzled national property. We have exposed dozens of his crimes.
    Through systematically reading the newspapers, we have gained a deeper understanding of how the bourgeoisie is shamelessly attacking us. Li Yinting, an unscrupulous merchant in Wuhan, has stooped so low as to cut corners and use inferior materials, harming our most beloved People's Volunteers. How is this different from the American imperialist bandits? We think: If Wu Ziqing had the opportunity, he would do the same. Wu Ziqing often says, "Selling inferior goods as good ones is the real skill!" Once, when the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant came to buy steel wire, he gave them bad ones. What great damage this will cause to production! If it were sold to a ordnance factory, wouldn't it also harm the People's Volunteers? This painful lesson has awakened us, and we deeply realize the importance of our work. We must resolutely draw a clear line with the capitalists and thoroughly expose their fraudulent behavior. We hope that all shop assistants in the city will take practical actions to consolidate the victorious achievements of this movement.
    All Shop Assistants of Xinchang Hardware Store

    信昌五金行店员检举奸商武子青
    编辑同志：信昌五金行经理武子青，一贯贿赂干部，盗骗国家财产。我们揭发了他的几十件罪行。
    经过有系统地读报，我们更认识了资产阶级是如何卑鄙无耻地向我们进攻。武汉市奸商李寅廷竟丧尽天良，偷工减料，陷害我们最可爱的人民志愿军。这和美帝国主义强盗有什么两样？我们想：如果武子青有机会，也会这样做的。武子青常说：“次货当好货卖，才叫本事！”有一次，石景山钢铁厂来买钢丝，他就给了坏的。这在生产上将起多大的破坏作用！要是卖给军械制造厂，不是也害了人民志愿军吗？这个沉痛的教训唤醒了我们，我们深深认识到自己工作的重要。我们要坚决地和资方划清界限，彻底检举资方欺骗行为。我们希望全市店员都以实际行动来巩固这次运动的胜利成果。
    信昌五金行全体店员
