Bourgeois Agent Zhou Yuru and Others Infiltrate Shijiazhuang Branch of Tianjin Railway Bureau
Colluding with Thugs and Profiteers to Steal and Swindle More Than 3 Billion Yuan in State Property
All Criminals Apprehended in Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Other Locations
The bourgeois "agent" Zhou Yuru and former director of the material room of the Engineering Section of the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, Liu Yingchun, colluded with major thugs, Kuomintang party members, Kuomintang officers, and major profiteers Li Julin, Hua Baoyi, Wang Zhida, Shi Zebo, and Li Tongxuan to steal more than 3 billion yuan in state property. This huge theft case has recently been solved. All the criminals involved, except for Liu Yingchun, who was arrested by the People's Court last year for corruption, have been apprehended in Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and other locations.
The bourgeois "agents" Zhou Yuru and Liu Yingchun, were both from backgrounds as rogue merchants. They infiltrated the Railway Bureau before the liberation of Shijiazhuang in 1947 and were retained by the People's Government after liberation. Since being retained, Zhou and Liu colluded with major thugs, former head of the local self-defense corps, former Bao chief Li Julin, Kuomintang Railway Division Secretary Hua Baoyi, Yan Xishan's bandit army 19th Army Commander Shi Zebo, Kuomintang Shijiazhuang City Party Department Secretary of Training Wang Zhida, and major profiteer Li Tongxuan to steal state property.
At the beginning of 1949, Zhou Yuru and Liu Yingchun stole economic intelligence regarding the large quantities of bricks and tiles needed for railway construction. They colluded with Li Julin and others to set up Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory in Shijiazhuang, with Li Julin as the manager, to monopolize the Railway Bureau's orders. However, they lacked funds, so Zhou and Liu adopted the method of signing false contracts and paying advance deposits to obtain large amounts of cash from the Railway Bureau. The methods they adopted were extremely despicable. First, Li Julin, in the name of the manager of "Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory," contracted to produce 900,000 cement tiles and 500,000 red bricks for the Materials Factory of the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration; the contract stipulated that 10 percent of the deposit would be paid first, but Zhou Yuru and Liu Yingchun secretly paid Li Julin 70 percent of the cash in advance. Li Julin used this cash to build twenty rooms, buy two tile-making machines, and buy a large amount of furniture, and then started production. Therefore, he could not deliver the goods on time. The losses caused to the state by advance payment of deposits and delayed delivery alone amounted to more than 200,000 jin of millet.
By the end of the same year, according to incomplete statistics, the total transaction amount between Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory and the Shijiazhuang Railway Branch was more than 320 million yuan. Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory stole (it can simply be said to be plundered) more than 200 million yuan of railway assets from it.
These "agents" sent by the bourgeoisie into the interior of people's enterprises are harming the country's construction undertakings at all times. Taking the corner-cutting in Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory's undertaking of railway orders as an example, from the establishment of Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory at the beginning of 1949 to the end of 1951, in the seven orders that have been investigated, state property suffered a serious loss of more than 990 million yuan. Among them, such as the two batches of cement tiles in April and September 1949, the state cement stolen by Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory and the defective goods delivered were equivalent to more than 130,000 jin of millet. More than 3,000 of these unusable defective goods are still thrown in the Materials Factory. The most serious was in April 1949, when the 500,000 red bricks delivered by Yisheng Brick and Tile Factory to the railway had a damage rate of 30 percent.
Zhou Yuru and Liu Yingchun also stole state economic intelligence and engaged in speculation and profiteering everywhere. For example, in the winter of 1949, the Central People's Government decided to issue People's Victory Index-Linked Bonds, and Zhou Yuru told Li Julin about this. In order to evade purchasing bonds, Li Julin diverted a large amount of funds to Taiyuan to open a branch factory. Li Julin colluded in Taiyuan with Li Dongcheng (Li Julin's nephew), who was transferred from the Shijiazhuang Branch to the Taiyuan Railway Branch as the head of the stone material section. The two criminals colluded with each other, stole state economic intelligence on a large scale, defrauded the railway of huge amounts of public funds, and engaged in speculative activities. In three years, the Taiyuan branch factory was gradually expanded into a large brick and tile factory with 80 tile-making machines and more than 500 million yuan in funds. In the spring of 1950, the construction of the South Tongpu Line and the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Line station buildings began, requiring a large number of bricks and tiles. Zhou Yuru again leaked the plan to purchase 4 million red bricks and 80,000 cement tiles to Li Julin. Li Julin purchased all the red bricks produced by various brick and tile factories in Shijiazhuang at a price of 150 yuan per brick and resold them to the Shijiazhuang Branch at a price of 200 yuan per brick. With just this one transaction, Zhou Yuru, Li Julin, and others obtained a huge profit of more than 200 million yuan.

    资产阶级坐探周裕如等混入天津铁路局石家庄分局
    勾结流氓奸商盗骗国家财产三十多亿元
    案犯已全数在石家庄、太原等地落网
    资产阶级派进天津铁路管理局石家庄分局材料厂的“坐探”周裕如、前工务段材料室主任刘迎春勾结大流氓、蒋匪党棍、蒋匪军官、大奸商李聚林、滑保义、王志达、史泽波、李同轩等盗窃国家财产三十多亿元。这个巨大盗窃案最近已被破获。有关案犯除刘迎春已因贪污在去年被人民法院逮捕外，全数在石家庄、太原等地落网。
    资产阶级的“坐探”周裕如、刘迎春，都是流氓商人出身，一九四七年石家庄解放前，就混进铁路局工作，解放后被人民政府留用。自被留用以后，周、刘两犯就和大流氓、伪自卫团长、伪保长李聚林、蒋匪国民党铁路分区书记滑保义、阎锡山匪军十九军军长史泽波、蒋匪国民党石家庄市党部书记组训科长王志达和大奸商李同轩等合谋盗窃国家财产。
    一九四九年初，周裕如、刘迎春盗取了铁路建设需用大批砖瓦的经济情报，和李聚林等勾结，在石家庄筹设义生砖瓦厂，由李聚林任经理，准备包揽铁路局的定货。但他们没有资金，周、刘两犯就采用订假合同、先支付定货款的办法，套取了铁路局的大量现款。他们采用的办法是非常卑鄙的。先是李聚林用“义生砖瓦厂”经理的名义，承做天津铁路管理局石家庄分局材料厂洋灰瓦九十万块、红砖五十万块；合同规定先交定款百分之十，但周裕如、刘迎春却暗中先支付给李聚林百分之七十的现款。李聚林就用这笔现款盖了二十间房，买了两部制瓦机，并买了大批家具，然后才开工生产。因此到期不能交货。仅预支定货款和延期交货这两项给国家造成的损失，就有二十多万斤小米。
    到同年年底，据不完全的统计，义生砖瓦厂和石家庄铁路分局的交易总额为三亿二千多万元。义生砖瓦厂从中盗窃（简直可以说是掠夺）的铁路资财就有两亿元以上。
    这些被资产阶级派进人民企业内部的“坐探”，每时每刻都在损害着国家建设事业。拿义生砖瓦厂承制铁路定货中的偷工减料来说，从一九四九年初义生砖瓦厂建厂起到一九五一年底止，在已查明的七次定货中，国家财产就蒙受九亿九千多万元的严重损失。其中如一九四九年四月和九月两批洋灰瓦，义生砖瓦厂盗窃国家洋灰和交纳的坏货，就折合小米十三万斤以上。这些不能使用的坏货，至今还有三千多块扔在材料厂。最严重的，是一九四九年四月，义生砖瓦厂向铁路交纳的五十万块红砖，破损率占了百分之三十。
    周裕如、刘迎春更窃取国家经济情报，到处进行投机倒把。如一九四九年冬，中央人民政府决定发行人民胜利折实公债，周裕如就把这一情报告诉了李聚林，为了逃避购买公债，李聚林就把大批资金疏散到太原开设了一座分厂。李犯在太原又勾结了由石家庄分局调到太原铁路分局任石料股股长的李东成（李聚林的侄子）。两犯互相串通，大肆盗窃国家经济情报，诈骗铁路巨额公款，进行投机活动。三年中，把太原分厂逐渐扩展成为拥有八十部制瓦机和五亿元以上资金的大砖瓦厂。一九五零年春，南同蒲线和石太线站房工程开始兴工，需用大批砖瓦。周裕如又把购置四百万块红砖和八万块洋灰瓦的计划泄漏给李聚林。李犯就把石家庄市内各砖瓦厂生产的红砖以每块一百五十元的价格全部收购，又以每块二百元的价格转卖给石家庄分局。只这一转手间，周裕如、李聚林等就获得暴利两亿多元。    （薛孔）
