The CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Military and Political Committee Make a Decision: Comprehensively Handle the Zhou Jifang and Song Ying Conspiracy and Frame-up Case; Wuhan Mayor Wu Defeng and Xie Bangzhi Removed from Party and Government Posts for Harboring Illegal Elements.

[This News report] The embezzlement case at the Wuhan Municipal Second Hospital and the ensuing conspiracy and frame-up case have been decided upon by the CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Military and Political Committee, based on thorough investigation and research. The truth of the entire case has been brought to light.

A staff member of the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau, using the pseudonym Chen Jie, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on September 1, 1950, reporting numerous wrongdoings of Song Ying, the former Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau. The CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission forwarded this letter to the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee for investigation and handling. The Wuhan Municipal Committee, based on this letter, instructed Song Ying to conduct a self-criticism. However, Song Ying not only failed to reflect on herself but instead harbored resentment. Under the protection and support of Zhou Jifang, the former Deputy Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, she manipulated the General Branch Committee of the CPC Health Bureau to make a decision that violated the Party Constitution and state law, pursuing the errors of the whistleblower. She summoned Ji Kaifu (a member of the Communist Youth League), Wang Shouzhen, Ma Jun, and other staff members of the Second Hospital, using threats and deception to conduct unreasonable investigations. Ji Kaifu and others, forced by circumstances, filed a complaint with the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, accusing Song Ying and others of violating human rights and violating laws and regulations. The details of this incident were reported in detail on page three of this newspaper on September 11 of last year.

Before the above incident concluded, on April 12, 1951, an embezzlement of public funds occurred at the Wuhan Municipal Second Hospital. The embezzler was Wang Qing, the hospital's supervisor. He had been in charge of the hospital's safe key after the hospital's cashier, Chu Zhizhong (a KMT secret agent), was arrested. During this time, he found a coppersmith and made a key identical to the safe key. After handing over the original key to the newly appointed accountant, he used the newly made key to steal over 12 million yuan from the Second Hospital. Because he was very flustered during the theft, he lost a lot of banknotes on the way back. These banknotes were discovered by several people, including Ji Kaifu. When Ji Kaifu and others followed the scattered banknotes to Wang Qing's house, Wang Qing appeared extremely embarrassed. Ji Kaifu suspected that Wang Qing was the thief and was very active in handling this theft case. Song Ying, harboring resentment towards Ji Kaifu for reporting her mistakes to Chairman Mao and the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, conspired to frame Ji Kaifu. She colluded with Wang Qing to falsely accuse Ji Kaifu of being the thief. On April 14, Song Ying notified the Fourth Branch of the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest Ji Kaifu. Later, after Sun Mailing, the director of the Second Hospital's medical affairs department and a Communist Party member, detailed the circumstances of the theft to the CPC Wuhan Municipal Fourth District Committee and the Fourth Public Security Branch, the Public Security Branch believed that Ji Kaifu had not committed the theft and released Ji Kaifu on the 15th. However, Song Ying's attempt to frame good people did not stop there. She immediately reported the release of Ji Kaifu to Zhou Jifang. Zhou Jifang then ordered the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau to re-arrest Ji Kaifu on the 17th. Since then, Ji Kaifu had been detained in the Public Security Bureau for more than eight months.

During this period, Song Ying systematically and deliberately fabricated facts to resist the organization. Because Communist Party member Sun Mailing insisted on revealing the truth to the higher-level Party organization, investigators, and this newspaper, Song Ying and others concentrated their fire on attacking Sun Mailing; and convened a meeting, instructing some people to defend Wang Qing, saying that Wang Qing was an "old cadre" who had undergone long-term revolutionary training and would never commit theft, and insisted that suspecting Wang Qing of embezzling funds was attacking transferred cadres (Wang Qing was a transferred cadre from the army). They repeatedly questioned Sun Mailing why he reported the situation to the higher-level organization? They insisted that "Ji Kaifu is Sun Mailing's confidant" and used various excuses to give Sun Mailing a major demerit. Afterwards, Wang Qing also warned Sun Mailing: "You can't rely solely on Party spirit to make a living." Song Ying also helped Wang Qing write letters of complaint to various places, falsely accusing Sun Mailing of being a "political conspirator." They slandered Li Zhilian, the Secretary-General of the CPC Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission, and Wang Shixun, the Director of the Investigation Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, of "harboring secret agents"; slandered Fan Dezhi, the Director of the Investigation Department of the Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission, of "accepting private commissions." Under the direction of Zhou Jifang and Song Ying, Peng Qiguang, the Chief of the Detective Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, used all means to force the coppersmith to falsely accuse Wang Shouzhen and others of being thieves who forged keys. Peng Qiguang first arrested a coppersmith surnamed Liu in Hanyang, and then detained the coppersmiths Li Deyu and Cheng Zhenyan, inducing them to say that Wang Shouzhen was the one who stole the money instead of Wang Qing. Even more seriously, they also used extremely despicable and vicious means to forge letters from secret agents in Hong Kong, slandering Ji Kaifu of having political problems. Zhou Jifang also believed that the Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission should not "interfere" in this matter. Song Ying refused to speak at the investigation meeting convened by the Fourth District Committee, but seized every opportunity to instruct others to create a bad atmosphere. For example, Miao Jiepei, the branch secretary of the Health Bureau, openly defended Song Ying at the Fourth Party Congress convened by the Wuhan Municipal Committee last December, brazenly attacking the Party.

In this way, Zhou Jifang and Song Ying and others insidiously and falsely turned an embezzlement case into an extremely complicated problem. Attempting to achieve their shameful goal of protecting themselves and framing good people.

The CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee was completely wrong from beginning to end in handling this case. First of all, the Municipal Committee failed to stop its own members and members of the Municipal Committee from illegally arresting people. At the beginning of the embezzlement case, Zhang Pinghua, the Secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Xie Bangzhi, the Deputy Secretary and Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, personally inspected the scene of the embezzlement, but their guiding ideology fell into the trap set by Song Ying and Wang Qing from the beginning, mistakenly believing that: this was someone framing Wang Qing, a "political conspiracy case." Therefore, starting from a subjective intention, they specialized in finding materials from a political perspective and advocated expanding the scope of arrests.

The Wuhan Municipal Committee's handling of this case seriously demonstrated a lack of organization and discipline, coupled with the domination of subjectivism and sectarian sentiments, which led to the expansion of the situation and the protracted nature of the problem. In the report given by the Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission to the Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission on May 1 last year, it still affirmed that "the possibility of Wang Qing stealing the money is very small." The Central-South Bureau immediately pointed out to the Municipal Committee on May 4: The possibility of Wang Qing stealing the money is not small but very large, pointing out that Wang Qing has lost the conditions to serve as a supervisor and must be dealt with appropriately. However, the Municipal Committee did not accept this instruction. Later, the Central-South Bureau instructed twice to suspend Wang Qing from his position, but the Municipal Committee still did not implement it. After Zhou Jifang ordered the arrest of Ji Kaifu, the Public Security Bureau detained Ji Kaifu together with counter-revolutionary criminals. Xie Bangzhi, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, personally arranged the investigation and interrogation of this case, setting a deadline to solve the case. He used great effort to find the coppersmith who made the key. However, he did not consider the fact that the time of forging the key was precisely when Wang Qing was in charge of the key. Xie Bangzhi explained Wang Qing's various suspicious points as accidental phenomena, in fact defending Wang Qing. Peng Qiguang, the Chief of the Detective Section of the Public Security Bureau, deliberately fabricated evidence, deceived the organization, harbored embezzlers, and framed good people, and violated interrogation policies, using disguised torture, fatigue interrogation, and tight cuffs, interrogating Ji Kaifu continuously for more than 60 hours at a time, and even when Ji Kaifu's legs were swollen and he fainted, he said that he was pretending to be crazy and sarcastically asked him "Do you want to appeal, where do you want to appeal to?" Regarding this incident, Wang Shixun, the Director of the Investigation Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, always insisted on the truth. In addition to actively expressing his opinions at the meeting, he also submitted correct opinions in writing to Xie Bangzhi, the Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee. Responsible comrades of the Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission have repeatedly pointed out to responsible comrades of the Wuhan Municipal Committee: Ji Kaifu should be released. The Wuhan Municipal Committee not only did not accept these opinions, but Xie Bangzhi, the Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, instead stated that he would rather be wrong to the end, and would eventually admit his mistake and apologize, but not release Ji Kaifu early. It was not until the truth of the case came to light and the Central-South Bureau instructed to release Ji Kaifu immediately that the Municipal Committee immediately complied. Peng Qiguang twice asked the embezzler Wang Qing to quickly find materials to defend himself, preparing to give up his Party membership and fight to the end! It was not until December 23 last year that the Central-South Bureau issued a strict written order that Ji Kaifu was released. In this order, the Central-South Bureau pointed out: When releasing him, the Public Security Bureau should first send someone to apologize to Ji Kaifu himself, and then the Municipal Government should send someone to the hospital to hold a mass meeting and make a self-criticism at the mass meeting to restore Ji Kaifu's reputation. However, when the Wuhan Municipal Committee released Ji Kaifu, they did not apologize to him. Peng Qiguang, the Chief of the Detective Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, instead asked Ji Kaifu to write a written self-criticism. Throughout the entire process after this case occurred, the Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission had given the Wuhan Municipal Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission five written instructions and multiple oral instructions, but the Wuhan Municipal Committee did not seriously implement them.

The Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government and the Party Group Secretary Wu Defeng also completely adopted the wrong attitude towards this case. The Party Group did not make any criticism of Zhou Jifang's unauthorized arrest of people and criminal acts of infringing on human rights. When the Municipal Government Party Group held a meeting the day after Ji Kaifu was arrested, Song Ying and others reported the case, and the Party Group immediately approved it. In the course of the development of the incident, the Party Group took the wrong attitude of supporting this illegal behavior. Wu Defeng publicly defended the embezzler Wang Qing at the meeting, saying that "The more evidence of Wang Qing's embezzlement, the more counter-evidence there is." Making the embezzler Wang Qing dare to boldly frame good people. As for the "forcing confessions and believing confessions" wrong methods and disguised tortures adopted by the responsible party members of the Public Security Bureau, the leaders of the Public Security Bureau did not prevent them in advance, and did not correct them afterwards, which was a serious dereliction of duty. This is related to the guiding ideology of the Municipal Committee.

In order to handle this case carefully and correctly, the CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau specially organized the Central-South Bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission, the Central-South Military and Political Committee's People's Supervision Committee, the Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, and 11 units including the Central-South District and Wuhan Municipal relevant agencies to repeatedly inspect and conduct on-site inspections of this case. The results prove that: The embezzler is indeed Wang Qing, the former supervisor of the Municipal Second Hospital, and Wang Qing himself has confessed to it, and has nothing to do with Ji Kaifu. The reason why Wang Qing falsely accused Ji Kaifu of being the thief in the past was to attempt to blame others for the crime of embezzling state property. The reason why Song Ying did this was mainly to deliberately create excuses to retaliate and frame Ji Kaifu. Wang Qing and Song Ying dared to be so bold and reckless because they had the strong support of senior cadres like Zhou Jifang, which is a hegemonic style and anti-Party and anti-people activity within the Party that developed from sectarianism. Zhou Jifang's style is usually very improper. He pulls the cadres he likes very close and takes care of them in every possible way; anyone who has opinions about him will be squeezed out and attacked by him. During his work in Wuhan, Zhou Jifang also arrested people who should not have been arrested many times, such as arresting three party members of the court without any basis, saying that they organized prisoners to riot; and helping Liu Jing, the former Dean of the Wuhan Municipal Production and Education Institute (who has been expelled from the party), arrest two workers from the Production and Education Institute, which left a very bad impression among the masses.

The CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau passed resolutions on January 28 and February 16: Wang Qing degenerated and embezzled state property, and instead blamed others, framing good people, and was expelled from the Party. Song Ying continued her erroneous actions of suppressing democracy and infringing on human rights, and then colluded with Wang Qing, taking the opportunity to retaliate and frame good people, and was expelled from the Party. Zhou Jifang continued his erroneous actions of supporting Song Ying's suppression of democracy, and then resisted the organization from a sectarian prejudice, resolutely supporting Song Ying's evil behavior of taking the opportunity to frame good people and the embezzler Wang Qing's blame on others, and was expelled from the Party. Peng Qiguang fabricated evidence, falsely accused good people, deceived the organization, harbored embezzlers, and violated policies in the process of interrogating Ji Kaifu, adopting the method of forcing confessions and believing confessions, implementing disguised torture, and was expelled from the Party.

The Central-South Bureau believes that the Wuhan Municipal Committee's serious lack of organization and discipline, behavior of resisting superiors, and other mistakes cannot be tolerated, and has decided to give a censure punishment and implement reorganization. Wu Defeng, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee and Mayor of Wuhan, and Xie Bangzhi, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, both agreed with and supported Zhou Jifang and Song Ying's opinions and their evil deeds, and were given a dismissal from Party posts punishment. Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, bears direct responsibility for this case, but has made a profound self-criticism, so he was given a public warning punishment and demoted to Deputy Secretary. In addition to ordering the arrest of criminals such as Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, and Wang Qing on January 29, the Central-South Military and Political Committee also decided on February 16 to remove Wu Defeng from his posts as Mayor of Wuhan, etc., and to remove Xie Bangzhi from his posts as a member of the Municipal People's Government, etc., and to give Zhu Dixing, the Deputy Mayor and Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, a major demerit. The Central-South Bureau also decided to commend Wang Shixun, the Director of the Investigation Department of the Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, Su Wei, the Secretary of the CPC Wuhan Municipal Fourth District Committee, and Sun Mailing, the Director of the Medical Affairs Department of the Second Hospital, who have always adhered to correct principles. Cancel the suspicion of Youth League member Ji Kaifu, restore his League membership, and encourage his consistent active work and insistence on struggle. Compensate Li Deyu, the coppersmith, for his losses and apologize. Comfort other comrades who have been wronged.

The Central-South Bureau believes that it has shortcomings in the process of handling this case: it failed to resolutely and severely correct the Wuhan Municipal Committee's lack of organization and discipline earlier. It failed to perceive the serious political nature of Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, and others' anti-Party and anti-people activities earlier, and failed to give timely and severe criticism, thereby prolonging the time for the correct resolution of this case.

    中共中央中南局和中南军政委员会作出决定
    全面处理周季方宋瑛等阴谋陷害案
    武汉市长吴德峰和谢邦治等庇护不法分子被撤除党内外职务
    【本报讯】武汉市立第二医院的盗款案件及由此而爆发的阴谋陷害案件，已经中共中央中南局和中南军政委员会，根据周密调查研究的结果，做出决定，全案真相业已大白。
    武汉市卫生局曾有化名陈颉的工作人员于一九五○年九月一日写信向毛主席检举原武汉市卫生局副局长宋瑛的许多错误行为。中共中央纪律检查委员会即将此检举信件转给中共武汉市委调查处理。武汉市委即根据此检举信指示宋瑛进行检讨，但宋瑛不仅不作自我反省，反而怀恨在心，在原武汉市人民政府副市长周季方庇护和支持下，操纵中共卫生局总支委员会，作出违反党章和国法的追查检举人的错误的决定，把第二医院工作人员纪凯夫（青年团员）、王守正、马骏等三人叫来，用威胁欺诈手段，进行无理追查。纪凯夫等迫不得已，乃向中共武汉市委纪律检查委员会控告宋瑛等侵犯人权的违法乱纪行为。这一事件的经过，去年九月十一日本报第三版已作详细报道。
    上述事件尚未结束，一九五一年四月十二日武汉市立第二医院发生了盗窃公款的事件。盗窃者是第二医院的监委王清。他曾在医院出纳褚致忠（是中统特务）被捕后，掌管着医院保险柜的钥匙。在这段时间内，他找铜匠又造了一把和保险柜钥匙相同的钥匙。当他把原来的钥匙交给新任的会计以后，就用另造的钥匙偷了第二医院的一千二百多万元。他因偷窃时十分慌张，在归来的路上丢了许多钞票。这些钞票为好几个人所发现，也为纪凯夫所发现。当纪凯夫等沿着散落的钞票追到王清的屋子时，王清表现极为狼狈。纪凯夫即怀疑王清是盗窃者，并在处理这一盗窃案的过程中表现得很积极。宋瑛因怀恨纪凯夫向毛主席和中共武汉市委纪律检查委员会检举自己的错误，就阴谋陷害纪凯夫。她和王清合谋，诬赖纪凯夫为偷盗者，于四月十四日由宋瑛通知武汉市公安局第四分局将纪凯夫逮捕。后经第二医院医务科长、共产党员孙麦龄将盗案发生时的情况，向中共武汉市第四区委员会和第四公安分局详述后，公安分局认为纪凯夫确无偷盗事实，乃于十五日将纪凯夫释放。但宋瑛陷害好人的企图并不就此罢手，当即将释放纪凯夫一事报告周季方。周季方乃于十七日命令武汉市公安总局将纪凯夫重新逮捕。此后，纪凯夫在公安局一直被扣押了八个多月。
    在此期间，宋瑛有组织有计划地捏造情况，对抗组织。由于共产党员孙麦龄坚持向上级党和调查人及本报揭露事实真相，宋瑛等乃集中火力攻击孙麦龄；并召开大会，指使一些人为王清辩护，说王清是经过长期革命锻炼的“老干部”，决不会有盗窃行为，并硬说怀疑王清盗款，就是打击转业干部
    （王清是部队转业干部）。他们反复质问孙麦龄为什么向上级组织反映情况？硬说“纪凯夫是孙麦龄的心腹”，并用各种藉口给孙麦龄记大过一次。事后，王清又警告孙麦龄：“不能光靠党性吃饭。”宋瑛并帮助王清向各处写控告信，诬蔑孙麦龄是“政治阴谋者”。诬蔑调查盗窃事件的中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会秘书长李之琏和武汉市委纪律检查委员会检查处处长王世勋“包庇特务”；污蔑中南局纪律检查委员会检查处处长樊德智“受了私人委托”。在周季方宋瑛的指使下，市公安局的侦察科长彭其光，用尽一切方法强迫铜匠诬称王守正等为伪造钥匙的盗贼。彭其光开始把汉阳一个姓刘的铜匠逮捕起来，接着又把铜匠李德玉、程贞雁拘押起来，诱逼他们将盗款人王清说成王守正。更严重的，他们还用极卑劣恶毒的手段，伪造香港的特务来信，污蔑纪凯夫有政治问题。周季方并认为中南局纪律检查委员会不应“干涉”此事。宋瑛则在四区区委所召集的调查会上拒不发言，但一有机会便指使别人制造恶劣空气。如卫生局的支部书记苗洁沛，在去年十二月武汉市委召开的第四次党的代表会上，就公然为宋瑛辩护，放肆地向党攻击。
    这样，周季方和宋瑛等人就把一个盗窃案件，阴险地违反真相地变成为极端复杂的问题。企图达到他们保护自己、陷害好人的可耻的目的。
    中共武汉市委在处理这一案件中从头至尾是完全错误的。首先市委未能制止自己的党员和市委的成员非法捕人。盗案发生之初，市委书记张平化和副书记兼纪律检查委员会书记谢邦治，虽亲自视察盗案现场，但他们的指导思想一开始就陷入了宋瑛和王清所布置的圈套内，错误地认为：这是有人陷害王清，是“政治阴谋案件”。于是从主观意图出发，专门从政治方面去找寻材料，主张扩大逮捕范围。
    武汉市委对这一案件的处理，严重地表现了无组织无纪律，又加上主观主义、宗派情绪的支配，遂使事态扩大，问题迟迟不能解决。在去年五月一日武汉市委纪律检查委员会给中南局纪律检查委员会的报告中，还肯定“王清偷款的可能性很小”。中南局当即于五月四日向市委指出：王清盗款的可能性不是很小而是很大，指出王清已丧失了担任监委的条件，须作适当处理。但市委没有接受这个指示。以后中南局又两次指示停止王清的职务，市委仍未执行。周季方下令逮捕纪凯夫后，公安局把纪凯夫和反革命案犯关在一起，武汉市委副书记谢邦治亲自布置这一案件的侦察工作和审讯工作，限期破案，他用很大的力量去找寻制造钥匙的铜匠。而对于伪造钥匙的时间正是王清掌握着钥匙的时间这一事实，则不去考虑，谢邦治把王清的各种可疑之处，都解释为偶然现象，事实上是替王清辩护。公安局侦察科长彭其光有意捏造证据，欺骗组织，包庇盗窃犯，陷害好人，并违反审讯政策，用变相肉刑、疲劳审讯和紧铐的办法，一次连续审讯纪凯夫六十多小时，直到纪凯夫两腿发肿昏倒的时候，还说他装疯，并讽刺他“要不要上告，告到那里”等等。对于这一事件，武汉市委纪律检查委员会检查处处长王世勋一直坚持真理，除在会议上积极提出意见外，并书面向市委副书记谢邦治提出正确意见。中南局纪律检查委员会负责同志，曾多次向武汉市委员会负责同志指出：应释放纪凯夫。武汉市委不仅没有接受这些意见，市委副书记谢邦治反表示宁错到底，最后总承认错误，一总道歉，也不早放纪凯夫。直到案情大白，中南局指示立即释放纪凯夫时，市委亦未立即照办。彭其光却两次找盗窃犯王清要他赶快找辩证材料，准备党籍不要，也要拚到底！直到去年十二月二十三日中南局发出严格的书面命令后，纪凯夫才被释放。在这一命令中，中南局曾指出：释放时要首先由公安局派人向纪本人道歉，接着由市政府派人到医院召开群众大会并在群众大会上作自我批评，为纪凯夫恢复名誉。但武汉市委在释放纪凯夫时，却没有向他道歉，市公安局侦察科长彭其光反而叫纪凯夫写书面检讨。在此案发生后的整个过程中，中南局和中南局纪律检查委员会前后曾给过武汉市委和武汉市委纪律检查委员会五次书面指示和多次口头指示，武汉市委均未认真执行。
    武汉市人民政府的党组及党组书记吴德峰，对这一案件也完全采取了错误的态度。党组对周季方的擅自捕人、侵犯人权的犯罪行为，没有提出任何批评。当纪凯夫被捕的第二天市府党组开会时，宋瑛等报告了这一案件，党组就立刻给予批准。在事件发展过程中，党组更采取了支持这种违法行为的错误态度。吴德峰在会议上公开地为盗窃犯王清辩护，说“王清盗窃的证据愈多，恰恰是反证愈多。”使盗窃犯王清敢于大胆陷害好人。至于公安局负责的党员所采取的“逼供信”的错误办法和变相的肉刑，公安局的领导人事先没有加以防止，事后又不予纠正，乃是严重的失职。这和市委的指导思想是有关系的。
    中共中央中南局为了慎重、正确地处理这一案件，特组织中南局纪律检查委员会、中南军政委员会人民监察委员会、武汉市委纪律检查委员会及中南区和武汉市各有关机关共十一个单位联合对此案件进行反复检查和现场视察。结果证明：盗款人确系前市立第二医院监委王清，王清本人也已供认不讳，和纪凯夫毫无关系。过去王清所以诬纪凯夫为偷盗者，乃是企图将偷窃国家财产的罪行嫁祸于人。宋瑛所以这样作，主要是蓄意制造藉口，报复陷害纪凯夫。王清和宋瑛敢于这样胆大妄为，又是由于有周季方这样的高级干部的有力支持，这是从宗派出发而发展起来的党内的一种恶霸式的作风和反党反人民的活动。周季方平素作风很不正派，凡是他喜爱的干部他就拉得很紧，照顾备至；凡是对他有意见的人，就遭到他的排挤打击。周季方在武汉工作期间，也曾多次逮捕过不应逮捕的人，如毫无根据地逮捕法院三个党员，说他们组织犯人暴动；又如帮助前武汉市生产教养院院长刘静（已开除党籍）逮捕生产教养院的两个工人，都在群众中留下了很坏的影响。
    中共中央中南局已于一月二十八日和二月十六日通过了决定：王清堕落蜕化，盗窃国家财产，反而嫁祸于人，陷害好人，开除其党籍。宋瑛继其压制民主，侵犯人权的错误行动之后，又和王清合谋，借端报复，陷害好人，开除其党籍。周季方继其支持宋瑛压制民主的错误行动之后，又从宗派成见出发，抵抗组织，坚决支持宋瑛借端陷害好人、盗窃犯王清嫁祸于人的罪恶行为，开除其党籍。彭其光捏造证据，诬陷好人，欺骗组织，包庇盗窃犯，并在审讯纪凯夫过程中，违背政策，采用逼供信的方法，实行变相的肉刑，开除其党籍。
    中南局认为武汉市委严重的无组织无纪律、抵抗上级的行为以及其他错误是不能容许的，决定给予指责处分，并实行改组。武汉市委副书记、武汉市市长吴德峰和武汉市委副书记谢邦治都同意并支持周季方、宋瑛的意见和他们的罪恶行为，给以党内撤职处分。市委书记张平化对此案负有直接责任，但已作了深刻的检讨，故从轻给予当众警告的处分并降为副书记。中南军政委员会除于一月二十九日下令逮捕周季方、宋瑛、王清等罪犯外，也已于二月十六日决定撤除吴德峰的武汉市长等本兼各职，撤除谢邦治市人民政府委员等本兼各职，给予副市长兼市公安局长朱涤新以记大过一次的处分。中南局并决定对始终坚持正确原则的市委纪律检查委员会检查处处长王世勋、中共武汉市第四区区委书记苏苇、第二医院医务科长孙麦龄给予表扬。对青年团员纪凯夫取消其嫌疑，恢复其团籍，对其一贯积极工作和坚持斗争予以鼓励。对铜匠李德玉等赔偿损失并道歉。对其他受冤屈的同志予以安慰。
    中南局认为自己在处理这一案件的过程中，是有缺点的：对武汉市委这种无组织无纪律的行为未能更早地坚决严厉加以纠正。对周季方、宋瑛等的反党、反人民的活动未能更早地洞察其严重的政治性质，及时予以严厉的批判，因而拖长了这一案件正确解决的时间。
