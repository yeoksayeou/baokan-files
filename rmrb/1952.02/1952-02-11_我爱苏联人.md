    I Love the Soviet People
    Wei Wei
    In this world, only sincerity is the hardest thing to forget.

    Thinking back to those days in the Soviet Union, those short days, how many Soviet people I embraced and kissed! Old poets, their beards touching my neck as they kissed me, children climbing onto my lap and gazing at me. When we shook hands, embraced, and kissed, I, I saw their eyes, the sincerity dripping from the eyes of the Soviet people.

    On the day of leaving Leningrad, the poet Li Ji received a letter. What kind of letter was it? It was a poem, somewhat disorganized due to emotional excitement! It was written by a young man named Surkov. Among them were these few lines:

    I don’t think about how I don’t understand your language,
    Nor do I think about how you don’t understand our Russian,
    In short, I—a Stalingrad man,
    And you—from the shores of the Yangtze River, ……………………
    We stand, loath to let go of each other's hands,
    Our gazes meet and linger,
    But in this silence,
    We hear a beautiful word—"friend."

    Yes, just as this Soviet youth described, we and our friends were so "attuned to each other"! We used our eyes to convey emotions that language could hardly express!

    In a hotel in Leningrad, once while eating, to be honest, I wasn't very hungry, so I couldn't complete my dear friends' "task." What do you think, the two female comrades serving the food, they cleared away the plates of others who had finished, with a clatter, but they wouldn't clear mine. And they looked at me with such a look, as if to say, "Look, we won't clear it unless you finish it!" Their sincere enthusiasm made them forget that they were serving guests, revealing the feelings of older sisters towards a younger brother. Oh, here I must mention Marozova, sent by the Soviet Writers' Association to welcome us. All the long way from Manchuria to Moscow, in order to observe who was eating less, her eyes were patrolling like vigilant sentries at every meal. What kind of feeling is this!

    On the day of the October Revolution, it wasn't just a pair but countless pairs of such enthusiastic, such sincere eyes watching us! That day, among the hundreds of thousands of parading people, apart from the most enthusiastic in front of the great Lenin Mausoleum—in front of the podium—it was the place where we few Chinese delegation members were watching the ceremony. When that happy flow of people surged over, as soon as they saw we were Chinese, they all turned towards us like smiling sunflowers. Waving to us, or waving bouquets held high, cheering. Especially those many children sitting on their fathers' shoulders also waved their little hands to us, and even smaller children, adults grabbed their little arms and waved them towards us. Some people even wanted to squeeze out of the crowd to get close to us. They shouted: "Great Chinese people—Hurrah!" "Mao Zedong—Hurrah!" shaking the paper flowers until they fell to the ground. Especially when the names of the two giants were linked together, shouting "Stalin—Mao Zedong," they passionately threw bouquets at us. Many, many people, especially those old women, they walked far away, still looking back at us, looking at us. I muttered in my heart: Old mothers, we didn't not see it, we all saw how you were looking at us!

    In the home of worker Trusson in Stalingrad, we spent an evening. Under the magnificent lamps, beside a pot of lemon's broad leaves, his little son constantly stroked the Mao Zedong badge we gave him, tilting his head and smiling, showing it to his father. The father and son sweetly kissed. Then Trusson raised his smiling eyes and looked at us: "We just like him!" He also said, "You might not know, when the news of the founding of New China reached us here, we were so excited that we talked about it for a whole month! Do you know what I like to read in the newspaper the most? … I really like the speeches of Zhou Enlai and Guo Moruo! Not to mention Chairman Mao's. Tell me, how does Zhou Enlai like to start his speeches, he likes to say, I represent 475 million… You listen, 475 million! I really love to hear these words!" Someone added that 475 million included Taiwan, Trusson said seriously: "Of course it's included! We don't want other people's land; but our own land, even this little bit," he compared it with his fingernail, "cannot be ceded!" He also said with a smile: "Hasn't Tibet been liberated?… How are the workers in China now, do you think I will have the opportunity to go to China to see our counterparts?"

    …Also in Stalingrad, at a dinner party, everyone drank so much wine that they really couldn't drink anymore. Someone went to toast with the chairman of the state writers' association. This chairman, this sincere poet, he picked up a full glass of vodka that was about to overflow, as if picking up a burden that was difficult to bear, and then put it down again, looking down at the wine glass, he pondered for a moment, and finally raised the glass high again, saying: "Comrades! I am still not drunk. …I want to say something from my heart. Speaking honestly, we Russians don't know why we like Chinese people so much..."

    Saying this, he drank it all in one gulp, and embraced our old delegation leader, Comrade Feng Xuefeng. Everyone watched their kiss for several minutes. …

    In the blizzard, we visited Tolstoy's former residence in Yasnaya Polyana. The person in charge of this former residence, Comrade Popov, had gray hair and seemed to be a solemn, taciturn old man. We sat together and talked about the feelings between Russians and Chinese people. When we talked about the great assistance of the Soviet Red Army to us, I recited a poem I wrote when I passed through Manchuria: On the white snow, stands a new building, there are several Red Army soldiers, also buried in this place. How resolutely they fought here, their blood flowed on this building! Although this place once became a ruin, this new building stands again on the white snow. Although this place is not like the green grass and blooming flowers of southern China, this building, it looks as beautiful as a flower. Mongolians ride horses and roam freely here, children play and sing here,
    Red Army soldiers, I don't know if you can still hear their
    singing,
    But whoever passes by here must take a closer look at this building.
    The old man stood up, he looked at each comrade one by one, and then said solemnly and slowly: "I want to talk about myself, why I love you so much. - You probably don't know," he said, "In the most difficult period of our Soviet motherland, that is, the period of the civil war, I was a general in the Red Army." Everyone watched him more quietly and respectfully. He touched his white hair: "At that time, there were 120 Chinese people in our division. Not others, but Chinese people. Who in the whole division did not praise their bravery, their excellent hard work? I know how they shared a piece of black bread with the Russians, and I also know on which Russian land they shed blood. …" He was silent for a moment, and then continued: "Maybe there are many Chinese people with the surname Wang, at that time everyone affectionately called them all 'Comrade Wang'," he said, "Today I see you, it's like seeing my 'Comrade Wang' comrades again..."

    The old man spoke, sat down, and looked at us again.

    The comrades also looked at him, as if his emotionally deep, old man's voice was still ringing in our ears.

    I thought, I thought: What power brings these two great nations so closely together, is it the noble and magnificent ideals, the common struggle, the common path, the noble blood. It is these that make us twisted together like iron ropes, and even more like iron in a steelmaking furnace, purely and brilliantly melted together. So that without having to go through language, or having to ask names, simply by each other's eyes, simply because you are "Chinese" and he is "Soviet," you can understand each other and trust each other. Therefore, it can be understood: why in Beihai Park,
    a Chinese person would cast such a touching smile at a stranger from the Soviet Union? Why in Moscow, would a group of Soviet people surround a Chinese person so enthusiastically wanting a Mao Zedong badge? Especially those children, when they won the badge, gave such sincere joy. … This kind of smile, this kind of gaze, is truly worthy of being called friendship. This is something that people in the same trench have! This is something that can repel any evil forces!

    This makes me think again: on the Korean battlefield, isn't the touching friendship between the Chinese and Korean people also like this?…

    Once, in front of the writers in Tbilisi, Georgia, I talked about the Korean battlefield, about the news of the sacrifice of several of my old comrades there, and the table was immediately silent, and then, a deep elegy rose up. Russians, Georgians, Armenians, sometimes high-pitched and sometimes low-pitched dirges. The singing was interspersed with exclamations, the elderly nodded, and the corners of the women's eyes dripped with heavy tears.

    When we took off from Moscow and returned home, I was reciting in my heart: Sincere friends, goodbye! I am grateful that you love our motherland so much, and love our Chinese people!… I also love you. I savored the sentence we often said to each other in the Soviet Union: "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is the guarantee of world peace." I repeatedly savored it, carefully savored it, and I asked myself if I understood the deep meaning of this sentence.

    我爱苏联人
    魏巍
    世上，只有真诚的东西，是最难叫人忘记的。
    回想起在苏联的那些日子，那些短短的日子，我跟多少苏联人拥抱过、亲吻过呵！年老的诗人，胡须垂上我的脖子亲着我，孩子们爬上我的膝头瞅着我。当我们握手时、拥抱时、亲吻时，我，我看见了他们的眼睛，苏联人眼睛里滴露的真诚。
    临离开列宁格勒那天，诗人李季接到一封信。是一封什么信呢，是一篇被感情激动得有些杂乱的诗！这是一个叫苏尔珂夫的青年写的。其中有这么几句：
    我不去想，我怎么不懂你的言语，
    也不去想，你怎么不懂我们的俄文，
    总之，我——斯大林格勒人，
    而你——来自长江之滨，……………………
    我们站着，两不释手，
    目光久久地相亲相投，
    可是在这沉默里，
    却听出一个美丽的字眼——“朋友”。
    是的，正像这位苏联青年所描写的，我们跟我们的朋友们，就是这样地“相亲相投”！就是这样地用眼睛传递着语言也难传达的感情！
    在列宁格勒的旅馆里，有一次吃饭，老实讲我不太饿，也就没有能完成我的亲爱的朋友们的“任务”。你说呢，那两个端饭的女同志，把别人吃光的盘子哗哗地撤走了，就不给我撤。而且用那样的一种眼光看我，好像说：“你看，你不吃光就不给你撤！”她俩的真挚的热情，使她们忘记了是在招待宾客，流露了年长的姐姐对待弟弟的感情。哦，在这里我不能不提苏联作家协会派来迎接我们的玛罗左娃。她自满洲里到莫斯科的长途中，为了察看那个人吃得少，每吃饭，她的眼睛就像机警的哨兵一样在巡逻着。你说这是怎样的一种感情！
    十月革命节那天，那就不是一双而是多少双这样热情、这样真诚的眼睛望着我们！那天，几十万的游行队伍，除了在伟大的列宁墓前——在主席台前最热烈，就数我们几个中国代表团观礼的地方。当那幸福的人流涌过来的时候，一瞅见我们是中国人，就像嘻嘻笑着的向日葵一样，全朝向我们。向我们招着手，或者摇着高举着的花束，欢呼起来。特别是那些许许多多坐在父亲肩头上的孩子们，也向我们招着小手，更小一点儿的孩子，大人捉住他们的小胳膊向我们摇着。有的人甚至想从人丛里挤过来，跟我们亲近。他们高喊着：“伟大的中国人民——乌拉！”“毛泽东——乌拉！”把纸花摇得落了一地。特别是把两个巨人的名字连在一起，喊着“斯大林——毛泽东”的时节，就激情地把花束投向我们。许许多多的人，特别是那些老婆婆们，她们走过去了老远，还回头望我们，望我们。我心里叨念着：老妈妈呵，我们不是没有看见，我们都看见了您是怎样地在望着我们！
    在斯大林格勒工人特鲁森的家里，我们曾度过一个晚上。在华美的灯盏下，在一盆柠檬的阔叶旁边，他的小儿子不断地抚摸着我们送他的毛泽东纪念章，歪着头笑着，给他的父亲看。父亲跟儿子甜蜜地亲着。而后特鲁森抬起笑的眼睛望着我们：“我们就是喜欢他哟！”又说：“你们怕不知道吧，当新中国成立的消息传到我们这儿，把我们兴奋得直谈了一个月！你知道我看报最喜欢看什么？……我真喜欢周恩来、郭沫若的讲话！毛主席的更不用说。你说周恩来讲话爱怎么开头，他爱说，我代表四万万七千五百万……你听，四万万七千五百万！我真爱听这几句！”有人为了说得更清楚，补充说四万万七千五百万是包括台湾在内的，特鲁森严肃地说：“当然在内！别人的土地我们不要；可是我们自己的土地，就是这么这一点点，”他用手指甲比了那么一点儿，“也不能出让！”他又笑着说：“西藏不是已经解放了么？……现在中国的工人怎么样呵，你们看，我还有机会去中国看看我们的同行吗？”
    ……也是在斯大林格勒，在一次晚宴席上，酒，大家都喝得实在实在不能再喝了。有谁又去跟州作家协会主席碰杯了。这位主席，这位真挚的诗人，他端起了满满一大杯快要漫出来的沃特卡，像挑起一付难以胜任的重担一样，又放了下去，低头望着酒杯，沉吟了片刻，终于又把杯子高高地擎了起来，说：“同志们！我还，还没有喝醉。……我要说一句心里的话。说良心话，我们俄罗斯人不知道怎么那样地喜欢中国人……”
    说着，他一气喝了下去，抱住了我们的老团长冯雪峰同志。大家都望着他俩好几分钟的亲吻。……
    在漫天风雪中，我们访问了托尔斯泰在雅斯亚那巴利亚那的故居。这个故居的负责人波波夫同志，头发斑白，看来是一个庄严的，很不爱讲话的老头子。我们坐在一块儿，谈起俄罗斯人跟中国人的感情。当我们谈到苏联红军对于我们的重大援助的时候，我朗读了我过满洲里时写下的一篇诗：白艳艳的雪地上，立着一座新的楼房，有几个红军战士呵，也埋葬在这个地方。他们是怎样地在这儿坚决的战斗，他们的血流在了这座楼上！这儿虽曾变成了一座废墟，但白艳艳的雪地上又立起这座新的楼房。这儿虽不像祖国的江南草绿花放，可这楼房呵，好看得像花朵一样。蒙古人骑着马在这儿自由的游逛，小孩子在这儿嬉戏歌唱，
    红军战士呵，我不知道你能不能还听见他的
    歌唱，
    但无论谁在这儿经过，也要细看看这座楼房。
    老头子站了起来，他把每个同志都看了一眼，然后庄严地、慢慢地说：“我要谈一谈我自己，我，为什么怎样地爱你们。——你们恐怕不知道，”他说：“在我们苏维埃的祖国最困苦的时期，就是内战时期，我是红军里的一个将军。”大家更沉静，更尊敬地注视着他。他摸了一下自己的白发：“那时，在我们师里有一百二十个中国人。不是其他人，而是中国人。全师里谁不称赞他们的英勇，出色的勤苦？我知道，他们怎么样跟俄罗斯人共同分一块黑面包，我也知道，他们在哪块俄罗斯土地上流过血。……”他沉默了一下，又接着说：“也许中国人姓王的多吧，当时大家就亲热地，统统管他们叫‘姓王的’，同志们，今天我看到了你们，就像又看到我那些‘姓王的’战友一样……”
    老头子说过，坐下，又望着我们。
    同志们也望着他，好像他那感情深沉的、老年人的声音，还在我们的耳边响着。
    我想着，我想着：是什么力量，把这两个伟大的民族这样亲密地连在一起呵，是高尚壮丽的理想，共同的斗争，共同的道路，高贵的血。就是这些，才使得我们像铁绳一样地拧在一起，更像炼钢炉里的铁，纯净地灿烂地溶在一起。以至无须通过语言，也勿须询问名字，单凭彼此的眼睛，单凭你是
    “中国人”他是“苏联人”，就可以相互了解，相互信赖。因此，可以明白：为什么在北海公园里，
    一个中国人会向一个陌生的苏联人投过那样动人的笑容？为什么在莫斯科，一群苏联人会围着一个中国人那么热烈地要一个毛泽东纪念章？特别是那些孩子们，在夺得纪念章的时候，投过来那样诚挚的喜悦。……这种笑容，这种眼光，就是真正可以称得起友谊的友谊。这是蹲一条战壕的人们之间才有的东西！这是可以击退任何恶势力的东西！
    这使我又想起：在朝鲜战场上，中朝人民的感人肺腑的友谊，不也是这样的么？……
    一次，在乔治亚比利斯作家们的面前，我谈到朝鲜战场，谈到我的几个老战友在那儿牺牲的消息，席上，马上寂然无声，接着，就升起了一片深沉的悲歌。俄罗斯人，乔治亚人，阿尔美尼亚人时而高昂时而低沉的悼歌。歌声里夹着赞叹声，老年人点着头，女人的眼角垂着重泪。
    当我们从莫斯科起飞归来的时候，我心里在低念着：真诚的朋友们，再见吧！我感激你们是那样爱我们的祖国，爱我们中国的人民！……我也爱你们。我吟味着我们在苏联彼此常说的一句话：“中苏人民的友谊，是世界和平的保证”。我反复地吟味着，仔细地吟味着，我问我自己懂得了这句话的深意没有。
