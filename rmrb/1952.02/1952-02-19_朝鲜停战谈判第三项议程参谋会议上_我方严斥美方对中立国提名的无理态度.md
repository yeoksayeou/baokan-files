    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th. At the staff meeting of the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 18th, our side sternly condemned the other side's groundless opposition to the neutral countries nominated by our side. Our side pointed out: "In order to quickly reach a complete agreement on the third agenda item, our side has put forward our nominations for neutral countries and formally suggested that both sides simultaneously and at once agree to all of the other side's nominations for neutral countries. According to the provisions of Article 38 of your own draft agreement, the definition of a neutral country is a country whose combat troops have not participated in hostilities in Korea. All the neutral countries put forward by our side truly meet this definition. You cannot provide any reason, nor is there any reason, to oppose any of the neutral countries nominated by our side. You cannot provide any reason, nor is there any reason, to oppose our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral country. The Soviet Union is a country in the United Nations that has not only consistently opposed intervention in the Korean War, but also advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. If the Soviet Union cannot be nominated as a neutral country, then there is simply no neutral country in the world. What is especially strange is that you have agreed to Poland and Czechoslovakia, but you disagree with the Soviet Union, which is simply an intolerable and unreasonable attitude. Our side firmly opposes your unreasonable attitude. For the sake of the Korean armistice, we request that you seriously reconsider your position and withdraw your unreasonable opposition. We believe that if it is necessary to carry out the consent procedure, both sides should simultaneously and at once agree to all the other side's nominations for neutral countries. Otherwise, according to the provisions of Article 38 of the draft armistice agreement, both sides will each nominate three neutral countries, without any consent procedure."
    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, our side today put forward revised wording for some clauses of our draft, based on the exchange of views between the two sides on our draft of the 14th over the past few days. The plenary meeting of the delegations of both sides, originally scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on the 18th, has been postponed to 10:00 a.m. on the 19th.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我方严斥美方对中立国提名的无理态度
    【新华社开城十八日电】十八日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方严词痛斥对方毫无理由地反对我方所提出的中立国家。我方指出：“为了迅速达成第三项议程的全部协议，我方提出了我方对于中立国家的提名，并正式建议双方同时并一次同意对方对于中立国家的全部提名。根据你方自己所提出的协定草案第三十八款的规定，中立国家的定义是其战斗部队未曾参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家。我方所提出的所有的中立国家都是真正地符合于这一定义的。你方提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由反对我方所提出的中立国家中的任何一个国家。你方更提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由反对我方提名苏联为中立国。苏联是联合国中不仅一向反对干涉朝鲜战争，而且主张和平解决朝鲜问题最力的国家。如果苏联都不能作为中立国提名，世界上就根本没有任何中立国的存在。尤其奇怪的是，你方既同意了波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国，却又不同意苏联，这简直是不能容忍的无理态度。我方坚决反对你方的这种无理态度，为了朝鲜停战的利益，我们要求你方重新严重地考虑你方立场，撤回你方的无理反对。我们认为如果需要实行同意的手续，双方应同时并一次同意对方对于中立国家的全部提名。否则即按照停战协定草案第三十八款的规定，双方各自提名三个中立国家，不必进行任何同意手续。”
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方今天根据双方数日来就我方十四日草案所交换的意见，提出了对我方草案若干款的修正措词。原定于十八日上午十时举行的双方代表团大会延期至十九日上午十时举行。
