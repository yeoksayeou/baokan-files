Yangqu County Farm - A Banner of High Yields in the Eyes of Farmers
　　Liu Jie
　　The Farm’s Bumper Harvest Arouses Farmers' Envy
　　In 1951, Yangqu County Farm in Shanxi Province cultivated 264 mu of improved seed breeding land, with an average yield equivalent to 307 jin of millet per mu, exceeding the 229 jin per mu in 1950 by 34%, and exceeding the average of 175 jin per mu in the county's typical high-yield villages by 75.4%. The farm planted 14 mu of "Golden Queen" corn, of which 3 mu were particularly high-yielding, averaging 1,230 jin per mu, more than twice the highest yield of 400 jin among local people; the remaining 11 mu averaged 762 jin; the 14 mu produced a total of 12,074 jin, averaging 862 jin per mu, exceeding the 560 jin per mu in 1950 by 53.9%, and more than twice the local people's yield of 400 jin. Eight mu were planted with No. 4-198 sorghum, of which one mu of high-yield land produced 825 jin, exceeding the average yield of 480 jin per mu in 1950 by 71.8%, and more than 2.4 times the highest yield of 240 jin among local people; the remaining mu averaged 684 jin per mu. Seven mu were planted with No. 811 millet, of which one mu of high-yield land produced 765 jin, exceeding the 420 jin per mu in 1950 by 82%, and more than twice the average yield of 250 jin per mu in the typical village; the remaining mu averaged 479 jin per mu. The yields of jute, wheat, and other crops also greatly exceeded the production levels of the local people.
　　The farm's high-yield achievements greatly encouraged the masses' confidence in this year's high yields and improved techniques. The farm's prestige among the masses has increased, and everyone is willing to accept the farm's technical guidance. More than 20 villages near the farm, such as Shangzhuang, Beitadi, and Qinglong Town, have more than a dozen farmers coming to the farm every day to purchase new-style farm tools, order "Golden Queen" corn, No. 811 millet, "Yata Che" millet, and other improved varieties, and carefully inquire about cultivation methods and the reasons for high yields. They unanimously reflected: "It's not that the land doesn't produce grain, but that we haven't cultivated it properly." Labor model Zhu Wenhua proposed to all farmers in the county to "learn from the farm." Yangqu County Farm has become a banner of high yields in the minds of the masses.
　　Close Integration of Experimental Research and Mass Experience
　　Yangqu County Farm in Shanxi Province was established in the autumn of 1949. It currently has 344 mu of land, 6 draft animals (3 horses, 2 oxen, and 1 donkey), 49 sheep, 44 pigs, one rubber-wheeled cart and one old-style cart, and more than 40 pieces of farm equipment of various sizes. The farm has a total of 3 administrative cadres, 5 technical extension cadres, 2 trainees, and 23 workers.
　　Due to the limitations of equipment and cadre conditions, the farm only conducted simple variety comparisons and cultivation experiments. However, because it was able to integrate with the masses, it made a lot of achievements. In the selection of improved millet varieties, the farm tested 12 varieties. After the millet headed, it organized more than 300 people, including veteran farmers and cadres, to visit the farm for evaluation and comparison, combined with field records and actual yield comparisons, and selected the "Yata Che" millet variety, which has high yield and resistance to diseases (white hair, black smut), insects (stem borers, white-burnt insects), and is particularly drought-resistant and cold-resistant. Farmers in Guankou Village in the Second District followed the farm to test planting, proving that this millet variety produced 60 jin more per mu than the "Bailiusha" improved variety; the test planting results in the mountainous area of the Fifth District also exceeded the general varieties by 20%. Eight sorghum varieties were tested, with "Tiegen Tiao" and "Dahuangke" being the best. Zhu Wenhua of Shangzhuang Village used a small farm to experiment, and "Dahuangke" produced 60 jin per fen of land, exceeding other varieties by two to three times. The masses asked to exchange for this kind of seed. The farm also conducted corn hybridization experiments, using "Golden Queen" as the paternal line and Xiaohuang corn as the maternal line. The first-generation variety after hybridization was much higher in yield than Xiaohuang corn. The average weight of each ear of Xiaohuang corn was 5 liang, while the new variety was 7 liang and 3 qian. In terms of eliminating pests, the farm conducted soil pesticide efficacy identification experiments, and tested that one jin of wolfsbane seedlings or Veratrum root plus 30 jin of water, boiled for one hour, is very effective in controlling chewing pests; one jin of wolfsbane seedlings, mixed with 5 jin of water, soaked for one day and one night can prevent twenty-eight-spotted ladybugs; adding 25 jin of water, boiling for one hour, and adding one liang of alkali, is very effective in treating aphids. In terms of cultivation methods, the farm's experimental results proved that a row spacing of 1.5 chi (shortening the plant spacing) for millet results in a higher yield than 8 cun, and can also use a three-pronged hoe for weeding; it also proved that hoeing six times can increase production by 19% compared to hoeing three times. Farmer Zhang Zuanzhen experimented on a small farm and found a drought-resistant sowing method of using a small plow to string the land in the spring and then harrowing it several times, and pressing it twice after sowing, which solved the problem of sowing and preserving seedlings in the spring for the whole village. The above experimental results have been gradually promoted to the masses of farmers.
　　The demonstration and promotion work of Yangqu County Farm has the following characteristics: First, the determination of experimental projects is determined after the agricultural technology training class, labor model meeting, farm tool training class, veteran farmers, technical experts, etc. conduct joint research, so the experiments and promotions are all issues that the masses urgently demand to be resolved; Second, the experiments are closely combined with the on-farm breeding, the farmers' small farms, and the experience of labor models, so that correct conclusions can be drawn quickly and quickly promoted to the masses; Third, it closely combines the masses' native methods and native pesticides, which enhances the confidence and basis for promoting native methods and native pesticides; Fourth, each experimental project regularly organizes the masses to visit and discuss, exchange production experience, and the results of the experiment are immediately accepted by the masses.
　　Due to the farm's high-yield demonstration and promotion of scientific and technological knowledge, Yangqu County has now established 70 technical committees, focusing on the establishment of five small farms, 943 mu of seed retention land, and the improved seed breeding area has exceeded the farm's land area by 1.744 times. With the development of mutual aid groups, a technical promotion network with the farm as the core and the technical committee as the bridge has initially formed throughout the county. In the past year, the farm has promoted improved varieties of millet, sorghum, corn, wheat, jute, and black wheat on 5,100 mu of land through the promotion network, selected 23,500 jin of improved varieties of various crops, promoted 250 new-style farm tools, guided the county to sow 239,800 mu of land using seed soaking and mixing methods, and treated 33,900 mu of land for diseases and insect pests. In the spring of 1951, the farm also trained 117 labor models, village cadres, etc.; in the first half of the year, 3,380 people in the county received various small-scale specialized technology transfer through the promotion network. These people have become the backbone of improving agricultural technology.
　　How Achievements Are Made
　　Yangqu Farm has achieved remarkable results in both increasing production and demonstration promotion because it has implemented economic accounting, democratic management, and patriotic ideological education, so that all farm workers can work under certain plans and goals, and their production enthusiasm is very high.
　　(1) In terms of cost accounting: In the past two years, in addition to land and houses, the government has invested a total of 38,000 jin of millet in the farm. Now the farm has food, draft animals, livestock, farm tools, etc., worth 97,310 jin of millet (excluding land and houses), for a total profit of 59,310 jin. The unit area yield per mu has increased by 34.6% compared to 1950, the investment has increased by 67.7% compared to 1950, the land has increased by 46%, and the workers have increased by 64%. Therefore, the farm not only solved the supply problem for six cadres, but also built a new branch farm, and was able to invest heavily in land, laying the foundation for high yields.
　　(2) In terms of democratic management: The farm adopted the policy of relying on workers for steady development. Relying on the workers and masses and carrying out labor competitions is the key to high yields and doing a good job in promotion. In the spring of 1950, the farm planned to repair a canal, but the repair cost required 60,000 jin of millet, while the farm's total start-up cost was only 23,000 jin of millet. After discussion by all the workers, the workers decided not to spend a penny of the government's money and repair the canal themselves. Through the concerted efforts of all the workers, in the summer and autumn of that year, 240 mu of land were irrigated, ensuring the successful completion of the high-yield plan. On the basis of democratic management, scientific division of labor is implemented according to the technical expertise of the workers. For example, ploughing, rocking the seed drill, making fertilizer, and raising trees (nursery) are all assigned to specific people. During the busy farming season, workers are temporarily transferred to form shock teams, which are led by technicians to carry out competitions in teaching technology, comparing technology, comparing labor, and comparing efficiency, and the work efficiency is quickly improved. The farm is also experimenting with the "quota over-quota reward system," which has already achieved initial results. For example, peeling jute initially averaged only 5 jin per person per day; after implementing the "over-quota" reward, it increased to 25 jin, and Kuai Shou Qin Tonghe created a new record of 30 jin, and the general efficiency increased by four to five times.
　　(3) Through patriotic ideological education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the political consciousness of the workers has been further enhanced, and everyone has signed a patriotic pledge. This is the main driving force for creating large-scale high-yield records for various crops. In order to ensure the completion and strive to exceed the competition plan, the workers sometimes work all day during the day and also brave the rain to irrigate the land with floods at night. (The flood contains fertile topsoil, and irrigating the land with floods can cause this topsoil to accumulate on the ground, making the land more fertile.) Some workers also insist on not changing shifts. During the rush to weed and fight drought to protect seedlings, all the workers automatically requested to extend their work by two hours, and completed the high-yield plan of weeding four times and irrigating with floods twice on time.
　　In the future high-yield movement, Yangqu County Farm still needs to solve the following problems: According to the local conditions of the farm, the groundwater level is very low. If it can dig canals and wells to turn dry land into paddy fields, the output will be even higher; therefore, we should also pay attention to the problem of water conservancy irrigation. In addition, the supply of six cadres in this farm is solved by the farm's own production, and only a few people are supplied by the government, which makes the farm bear an excessive burden and affects the construction of the farm (at present, the farm does not even have some scientific equipment and office supplies); at the same time, the workers only have a monthly salary of 160 to 180 jin of rice, and their lives are quite difficult, which must be reasonably resolved.

    阳曲县农场——农民心目中的一面丰产旗帜
    刘杰
    农场的丰收引起了农民的羡慕
    山西省阳曲县农场一九五一年共种良种繁殖地二百六十四亩，每亩平均产量折合小米三百零七斤，超过一九五零年每亩二百二十九斤的百分之三十四，超过本县典型丰产村每亩平均一百七十五斤的百分之七十五点四。农场种植“金皇后”玉米十四亩，其中有三亩特别丰产，每亩平均收获一千二百三十斤，超过当地群众最高产量四百斤的两倍多；其余十一亩平均产七百六十二斤；十四亩共产一万二千零七十四斤，每亩平均产八百六十二斤，超过一九五零年每亩五百六十斤的百分之五十三点九，超过当地群众产量四百斤的一倍多。种植四—一九八号高粱八亩，其中一亩丰产地产八百二十五斤，超过一九五零年每亩平均产量四百八十斤的百分之七十一点八，超过当地群众最高产量二百四十斤的二点四倍多；其余每亩平均产量为六百八十四斤。种植八一一谷子七亩，其中一亩丰产地产七百六十五斤，超过一九五零年每亩四百二十斤的百分之八十二，超过当地典型村每亩平均产量二百五十斤的两倍多；其余每亩平均产量为四百七十九斤。洋麻、小麦等作物的产量，也都大大超过了当地群众的生产水平。
    农场丰产的成绩大大鼓舞了群众对今年丰产和改良技术的信心。农场在群众中的威信提高了，大家都愿意接受农场的技术指导。农场附近的上庄、北塔地、青龙镇等二十多村的农民，每天都有十多人到农场购领新式农具、订购“金皇后”玉米、八一一谷、“压塌车”谷等优良品种，并且仔细地询问耕作栽培方法和丰产原因。他们一致反映：“不是地不打粮，而是没作务到。”劳动模范朱文华向全县农民提出要“向农场学习”。阳曲县农场已成为群众心目中的丰产旗帜。
    试验研究和群众经验密切结合
    山西省阳曲县农场是一九四九年秋季开始建立的。现有土地三百四十四亩，耕畜六头（马三、牛二、驴一），羊四十九只，猪四十四口，胶皮轮大车和旧式大车各一辆，大小农具四十多件。全场共有行政干部三人，技术推广干部五人，练习生二人，工人二十三人。
    农场因为设备和干部条件的限制，仅作了简单的品种比较及耕作试验。但因为能和群众相结合，所以做出了不少成绩。在谷子的选用优良品种方面，农场试种了十二个品种，在谷子抽穗后，组织老农、干部等三百多人到农场来参观评比，结合田间记载和实际产量的比较，选出了产量大并能抗病（白发、黑穗）、抗虫（钻心虫、白焦虫）、特别耐旱耐冻的“压塌车”谷种。二区关口村农民跟着农场试种，证明这个谷种比“白柳沙”优种每亩多产六十斤；五区山地农民试种结果，收获量也超过一般品种百分之二十。高粱试验了八个品种，以“铁杆跳”、“大黄壳”为最好。上庄村朱文华用小农场试验，“大黄壳”一分地产了六十斤，超过其他品种二倍到三倍，群众纷纷要求调换这种种籽。农场又进行玉米杂交试验，用“金皇后”作父本，小黄玉米作母本，杂交后第一代的品种，远比小黄玉米产量为高。小黄玉米每穗平均重五两，新品种为七两三钱。在消灭虫害方面，农场作了土药剂药效鉴定试验，试验出狼毒苗或芦藜根一斤加水三十斤，熬一点钟，对除治咀嚼口类害虫效力很大；狼毒苗一斤，配水五斤，浸一昼夜能防治二十八星瓢虫；加水二十五斤，熬一点钟，加碱一两，治蚜效力很大。在耕作方法上，农场试验结果证明：谷子行距一尺五寸（缩短株距）比八寸产量大，并且还能使用三齿耘锄；又证明锄六次比锄三次可增产百分之十九。农民张钻珍在小农场上试验出春季先用小犁串地再多耙几次、播种后镇压两次的抗旱播种办法，解决了全村春季下种保苗的问题。以上各种试验成果都已逐步向农民群众推广。
    阳曲县农场的示范推广工作有以下几个特点：第一、试验项目的订定是经过农业技术训练班、劳动模范会议、农具训练班的老农、技术能手等共同研究之后确定的，所以试验推广的都是群众迫切要求解决的问题；第二、试验和场内繁殖、农民的小农场以及劳动模范的经验密切结合，因而能很快得出正确结论，很快推广给群众；第三、密切结合了群众的土办法、土药剂，增强了推广土办法土药剂的信心和依据；第四、每个试验项目都定期组织群众参观座谈，交流生产经验，试验的结果马上为群众所接受。
    由于农场的丰产示范和推广科学技术，目前阳曲县全县已建立了七十个技术委员会，有重点地建立了五个小农场，九百四十三亩留种地，良种繁殖区已超过农场土地面积一点七四四倍。随着互助组的发展，全县初步形成了一个以农场为核心、以技术委员会为桥梁的技术推广网。一年来农场经过推广网共推广谷子、高粱、玉米、小麦、洋麻、黑麦等优良品种在五千一百亩土地上种植，评选出各种作物优种二万三千五百斤，推广新式农具二百五十件，指导全县用浸拌种的办法播种二十三万九千八百多亩，治除了三万三千九百多亩地的病虫害。农场并在一九五一年春季训练了劳动模范、村干部等一百一十七名；全县在前半年经过推广网受到各种小型专题传授技术的有三千三百八十人。这些人都成了改良农业技术的骨干。
    成绩是怎样做出来的
    阳曲农场因为实行了经济核算、民主管理，进行了爱国主义思想教育，全场职工都能在一定的计划和目标下进行工作，生产情绪很高，所以使增产和示范推广工作都得到了显著成绩。
    （一）在成本核算方面：二年来除土地房屋外，政府共向农场投资三万八千斤小米。现在农场实有粮食、耕畜、牲畜、农具等折合小米九万七千三百一十斤（土地房屋不计在内），共得利润五万九千三百一十斤。每亩单位面积产量比一九五零年提高了百分之三十四点六，投资比一九五零年扩大百分之六十七点七，土地增加了百分之四十六，工人增加百分之六十四。因此，农场不仅自己解决了六个干部的供给问题，还新建了一个分场，并且能对土地大量投资，奠定了丰产的基础。
    （二）在管理民主化方面：农场采取了依靠工人稳步发展的方针。依靠工人群众、开展劳动竞赛是丰产和做好推广工作的关键。一九五○年春季农场计划修渠一道，但修渠费需要六万斤小米，而农场全部开办费才二万三千斤小米。经全厂职工讨论，工人们决定不花政府一文钱，自己动手修渠。经过全场工人的一致努力，当年夏秋季，二百四十亩地都浇上了水，保证了丰产计划的胜利完成。在民主管理的基础上，根据工人的技术特长，实行科学分工。如耕地、摇耧、制肥料、养树（苗圃）等，确定专人负责。农忙时临时抽调工人，组成突击小组，在技术工人领导之下，在教技术、比技术、比劳动、比效率等方面开展竞赛，工作效率很快提高。农场并试行“定额超额奖励制”，已经有了初步成绩。如剥洋麻最初每人每天平均只剥五斤；实行“超额”奖励后，增加到二十五斤，快手秦同和并创造三十斤的新纪录，一般的效率都提高了四倍到五倍。
    （三）经过抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育，职工政治觉悟更加提高，每个人都订立了爱国公约。这是创造各种作物大面积丰产纪录的主要动力。工人们为保证完成和争取超过竞赛计划，有时白日劳动一天，夜里还冒雨用洪水浇地。（洪水中夹有肥沃的表土，用洪水浇地可使这种表土淤积在地面，使土地更加肥沃。）有的工人并坚持不换班。在突击锄草和抗旱保苗时，全体工人自动要求延长工作两小时，按时完成锄草四次、浇洪水两次的丰产计划。
    在今后的丰产运动中，阳曲县农场还需要解决以下问题：按农场当地条件，地下水位很低，如果能再开渠打井，把旱田变为水田，产量就更能增加；所以，还应该注意水利灌溉问题。另外，这个农场有六个干部的供给是由场内生产来解决，只有少数人是由政府供给，这样使农场负担过重，影响了场内建设（目前农场连一些科学设备和办公用具都没有）；同时工人每月仅有一百六十到一百八十斤米的工资，生活相当艰苦，这是必须合理解决的。
