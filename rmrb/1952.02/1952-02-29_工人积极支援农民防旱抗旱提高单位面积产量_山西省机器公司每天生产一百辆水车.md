Workers Actively Support Farmers in Drought Resistance and Increase Yield per Unit Area
    Shanxi Machine Company Produces One Hundred Waterwheels Daily

    Li Wenbin, a worker from the Shanxi Machine Company, broadcasted to all farmers in the province four months ago, representing the company's employees. He said: We are rushing to produce waterwheels to support you in overcoming the drought and striving to increase yield per unit area. We believe that as long as workers and farmers unite, we are confident in overcoming any disaster.

    For four months, Shanxi has only had a little snow. Farmers are very worried, but they are not discouraged and have actively carried out winter irrigation and well-digging preparations to fight the drought. They believe in their experience of struggle: as long as they use every drop of water above and below ground, they will see a good harvest. Xu Genyou of Nanxindian, Xiangling County, dug a well and installed a waterwheel when the drought loomed last year. He turned eight mu of dry land into paddy fields, and the grain harvested was equivalent to twenty-five dan of wheat. He not only conquered the "drought" but also increased production by more than two times. Four months ago, when they heard the voices of their worker brothers, their confidence in fighting natural disasters was even stronger. Therefore, they have been actively ordering waterwheels. Farmers in the arid Jinbei area—Xinzhou Prefecture—originally ordered five hundred waterwheels and have now increased their order by three hundred. Farmers throughout the province have pre-ordered as many as 20,000 waterwheels from cooperatives this winter. Now, farmers in Yuncheng, Yuci, and Xinzhou prefectures want to increase the number of pre-ordered waterwheels.

    Every waterwheel order figure from the countryside has inspired the production enthusiasm of all employees of the Shanxi Machine Company. Red banner competitions are in full swing in the factory, as they want to meet the needs of farmers as quickly, as well, and in as great quantity as possible. The casting department is the key department for producing waterwheels. If this department can fully supply blanks, the production of other departments can be accelerated. The Eight-Character Wheel Casting Group used iron molds for casting in January because their tools and equipment were simple and the operation was difficult. However, due to lack of experience, production temporarily declined. In order to solve this problem, forger Zhang Zhengqi and others volunteered to form an Eight-Character Wheel Casting Group and launched a red banner competition with other groups, which quickly reduced the scrap rate. This not only finished the work left over from January but also completed the February production plan for blanks ahead of schedule. When making waterwheel pipes, the Fan De group of the machining department organized mutual aid groups according to the work procedures and actively improved tools, which doubled the edging efficiency, tripled the shearing efficiency, and increased the pipe rolling efficiency sixfold. The entire group can produce pipes for sixty waterwheels every day. The lathe group generally increased the production efficiency of machine frames by two times, and Communist Party member Hao Weihu can turn twenty machine frames every day, increasing the speed by three times. Due to the shortening of the production time of each process, the overall waterwheel production efficiency has increased by 1.2 times. Now the entire company can produce one hundred waterwheels per day. Currently, they are also studying the manufacture of bending machines to reduce manual processing procedures, striving to produce 150 waterwheels every day in late February.

    In order to assist farmers' drought resistance and production increase movement, workers not only try to speed up the production of waterwheels but also attach great importance to product quality. Zhang Zhengqi said: “In the old society, a half-inch difference in iron casting was not considered a mistake, but now even a half-point difference is unacceptable. Our red banner competition is to ensure that the farmer brothers are satisfied with the waterwheels they use.” The Shanxi Machine Company was originally a military factory of the warlord Yan Xishan, and it was only converted to agricultural machinery after liberation, so it does not have much experience. In the spring of 1950, the company manufactured 1,450 gear waterwheels and loaned them to farmers, but 700 of them developed faults as soon as they were used. Workers deeply realized the importance of product quality when they went to the countryside to repair waterwheels for farmers. Mechanic Fan De and others went to more than 30 villages in Xinzhou. He said: "It is dry and barren there. If the waterwheel is on the well but cannot be started, how can the worker-peasant alliance be consolidated?" Therefore, they sincerely solicited farmers' opinions as a reference for improving technology and improving quality. They found that shaking of the axle was the most troublesome thing for farmers and there was no solution. The reason was that a retaining rod was missing, so the waterwheels now made have been added with retaining rods. They also found that the wear rate of the eight-character wheel was very high, so the waterwheels now made are cast using iron molds. This hardens the surface of the wheel, making it strong and durable.

    For the sake of farmer brothers being able to buy high-quality and inexpensive waterwheels, workers are very economical with raw materials. The casting department collected the iron filings turned off by the lathes and melted them into 6,000 kilograms of pig iron. The casting department saved 14,150 kilograms of coke in one month. Now the iron material used for each waterwheel has been reduced from 130 kilograms to 114 kilograms. The materials they saved during this period can produce 600 more waterwheels.

    Now, they have completed the first batch of 7,000 Liberation-style waterwheel orders, of which 3,000 have been installed on farmers' wellheads for spring irrigation and drought resistance, ensuring that these farmers can sow seeds without rain. From mid-February, they have begun making new orders for 20,000 waterwheels.

    工人积极支援农民防旱抗旱提高单位面积产量
    山西省机器公司每天生产一百辆水车
    山西省机器公司工人李文彬，四个月前曾代表公司职工向全省农民广播。他说：我们正在突击生产水车，支援你们克服旱灾，争取提高单位面积产量。我们相信，只要工人和农民团结起来，战胜任何灾害都是有把握的。
    四个月了，山西只落了很少一点雪。农民们十分忧虑，但他们并没有灰心，都积极地进行了冬浇和打井准备，和旱灾作斗争。他们相信自己斗争的经验：只要利用地上地下一点一滴的水，就会看到很好的收成。襄陵县南辛店徐根有，当去年万里无云、旱象将成的时候，打了一眼井安上水车，把八亩旱地变成水田，收获的粮食折小麦二十五石；他不仅征服了“旱灾”，还使产量提高了两倍以上。四个月前，他们在听到工人老大哥的声音时，跟自然灾害作斗争的信心就更增强了。所以他们纷纷定购水车。枯旱的晋北地区——忻县专区农民原定购五百部水车，现在又增购了三百部。全省农民在冬季向合作社预购的水车已达两万部。现在运城、榆次、忻县专区的农民又要增加预购水车的数字。
    从农村里来的每一个水车定货数字，都鼓舞了山西省机器公司全体职工的生产情绪。红旗竞赛在工厂里热火朝天地开展着，他们要尽快、尽好、尽多地满足农民的需要。铸工部是生产水车的关键部门，这一部门能充分供应毛坯，其他各部生产就能加快速度。铸八字轮小组因为工具设备简单操作困难，在一月份改用铁模铸造；但由于缺乏经验，产量一时下降。为了解决这个问题，锻工张正祺等自报奋勇组成了一个八字轮铸造小组，和别的组开展红旗竞赛，使报废率很快降低。这样不仅把一月份所留下的活赶完，并且还提前完成了二月份生产毛坯的计划。机工部樊德小组，做水车管子时，按工序组织了互助组，又积极改进工具，使压边效率提高一倍，剪料效率提高两倍，卷管效率提高六倍。全组每天可生产六十部水车用的管子。镟工小组的机架生产效率普遍提高两倍，共产党员郝维湖每天可镟成二十个机架，速度提高了三倍。由于每一工序制品时间的缩短，整个水车生产效率就提高了一点二倍，现在全公司每天可以生产水车一百部。目前他们又在研究制造弯练机，以减少手工加工程序，争取二月下旬每天能生产水车一百五十部。
    工人们为了协助农民的抗旱增产运动，不仅想办法加快水车的生产速度，而且很重视产品的质量。张正祺说：“在旧社会时，铸铁活差半寸不算错，现在差半分连自己也交代不了。我们的红旗竞赛，就是要保证农民兄弟使用满意的水车。”山西机器公司原是阎锡山匪徒的兵工厂，解放以后才改做农业机械，所以经验不多。一九五○年春季，公司曾制造一千四百五十部牙轮式水车贷给农民，但其中有七百部开始使用就发生了故障。工人下乡为农民修理水车时都深刻地体会到产品质量的重要。机工樊德等到过忻县的三十多个村庄。他说：“那里天旱地干，水车架在井上却不能开动，工农联盟怎么能巩固呢？”所以他们曾诚恳地征求农民意见，作为改进技术提高质量的参考。他们发现车轴摇动是农民最头痛又没办法的事。原因是缺少一条档棍，所以现在作的水车都加了档棍。他们也发现八字轮磨损率很大，所以现在作的水车改用铁模铸造。这样使轮子表面硬化，就坚固耐用。
    工人们为着农民兄弟能买到物美价廉的水车，都非常节约原材料。铸工部把镟下的铁末子收集起来熔成了六千公斤生铁，铸工部一个月就节约了焦炭一万四千一百五十公斤。现在每部水车所用的铁料，已由一百三十公斤降至一百一十四公斤。在这个期间他们节约下来的材料，可以多生产六百部水车。
    现在，他们已完成第一批七千部解放式水车的定货，其中三千部已安装在农民的井口上春浇抗旱，保证这些农民能够无雨下种。从二月中旬起，他们已开始作二万部水车的新定货。
