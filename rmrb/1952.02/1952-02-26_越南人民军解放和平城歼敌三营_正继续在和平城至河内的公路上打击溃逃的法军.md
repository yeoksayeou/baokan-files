Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency: The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army announced on the evening of the 23rd that Hoa Binh City, the capital of Hoa Binh Province, which had been tightly surrounded by the People's Army since January 8th, was liberated by the Vietnamese People's Army at 12:30 PM on the 23rd. Enemy troops attempting to sneak out of Hoa Binh City on the night of the 22nd were intercepted by the People's Army, and two enemy battalions were annihilated in Ben Oa. One enemy battalion within Hoa Binh City was also completely wiped out by the People's Army. Fighting is still ongoing on Highway 6 between Hanoi and Hoa Binh City.

The communique described the detailed process of liberating Hoa Binh City: After the Vietnamese People's Army achieved victory in the Ba Vi Mountain and Black River areas on January 7th, they attacked and surrounded Hoa Binh City, the capital of Hoa Binh Province, which was occupied by the French army, and cut off Highway 6. The area surrounded by the People's Army included: Phuong Lam on the right bank of the Black River, the Tuong Son stronghold on the left bank of the Black River, the French strongholds of Ba Man and Song Cong in the south, the French strongholds of Dong Dinh and Thinh Lang in the north, and Hoa Binh City, the capital of Hoa Binh Province, in the center. The enemy gathered more than ten battalions of troops, attempting to break through Highway 6 within five days, but it took them twenty-five days to establish contact with the besieged French troops in Hoa Binh City. From then on, the enemy began to withdraw the wounded and heavy equipment from Hoa Binh City to Xuan Mai and Hanoi. At midnight on the 22nd, the enemy attempted to use the darkness to evacuate Hoa Binh City. A convoy of enemy vehicles, with headlights turned off and maintaining a distance of 300 meters between each pair of vehicles, traveled from Hoa Binh City through Ben Oa towards Phao Thon. The People's Army allowed some enemy troops to pass, and only launched an attack when there was only one enemy battalion left in Hoa Binh City and only two enemy battalions left in Ben Oa. The People's Army's artillery bombarded the enemy stronghold of Phao Thon, setting it on fire, destroying two enemy barracks and one bunker, and killing many enemy troops. An enemy steamship was also sunk in Ben Oa.

The People's Army also attacked an enemy transport convoy between Ben Oa and Phao Thon, destroying one tank, one 105mm howitzer, and fifteen vehicles carrying enemy troops and weapons. Because the damaged enemy vehicles and enemy corpses blocked this section of the highway, the remaining enemy troops in Ben Oa had to disperse into small groups and try to pass through the forest to Phao Thon. At the same time, other units of the People's Army attacked an enemy transport convoy between Phao Thon, Ao Trai, and Xuan Mai. Because the enemy vehicles had all been destroyed and were blocking the highway, the enemy was forced to continue their retreat on foot under the heavy fire of the People's Army.

In the Hoa Binh City area, the People's Army successively recovered the strongholds of Tuong Son, Phuong Lam, Song Cong, Ba Man, and Dong Dinh, and drove the enemy to the Thinh Lang stronghold, where they attacked and annihilated them. Many places in Hoa Binh City caught fire, scattered with vehicles and supplies left behind by the enemy in their hasty retreat. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the People's Army completely liberated Hoa Binh City.

Since the French invading forces invaded Hoa Binh City three months ago, the enemy has lost approximately 20,500 officers and soldiers in the North Vietnam region alone. The liberation of Hoa Binh City completely shattered the plan of former French invading forces leader de Tassigny to expand the war to Hoa Binh City.

    越南人民军解放和平城歼敌三营
    正继续在和平城至河内的公路上打击溃逃的法军
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社消息：越南人民军总部在二十三日晚发表公报说，从一月八日起就被人民军紧紧包围着的和平省省会和平城，已在二十三日下午十二时三十分被越南人民军解放。企图在二十二日晚偷偷地撤出和平城的敌军，遭到人民军的截击，敌军两个营在奔娥被歼灭。在和平城内的敌军一个营也被人民军完全歼灭。战斗仍在河内与和平城之间的第六号公路上进行中。
    公报叙述解放和平城的详细经过说：越南人民军一月七日在巴为山和黑水江地区获得胜利以后，就进攻并包围法军占领下的和平省省会和平城，并切断第六号公路。被人民军包围的地区计有：黑水江右岸的芳林、黑水江左岸的墙山据点、南部的法军据点巴曼和松岗、北部的法军据点东丁和听廊以及中部的和平省省会和平城。敌人集结了十个营以上的兵力，想在五天以内打通第六号公路，但是他们却费了二十五天的时间才与和平城内被包围的法军建立了联系。从那时以后，敌人就开始把伤兵和重型装备从和平城撤往春梅和河内。二十二日午夜，敌人企图利用黑夜撤出和平城。载运敌军的一队车辆把车灯关闭，每两辆汽车之间保持三百公尺的距离，从和平城经过奔娥前往漂村。人民军先让一些敌军过去，等到和平城内只剩下敌军一营，奔娥境内只剩下敌军两营的时候，才发动攻击。人民军的大炮轰击漂村的敌军据点，使该据点起火，击毁了敌军营房两处、掩体一处，并击毙了许多敌军。敌军汽船一艘也在奔娥被击沉。
    人民军又攻击奔娥和漂村之间的一支敌军运输队，击毁了坦克一辆、一○五公厘口径大炮一门和载运敌军与武器的汽车十五辆。由于被破坏的敌军车辆和敌军尸体阻塞着这一段公路，奔娥的残余敌军就不得不分散为小股，设法经过森林前往漂村。同时，人民军其他的部队又攻击漂村、奥泽和春梅之间的一支敌军运输队。由于敌军车辆都已被破坏而且阻塞着公路，敌军就被迫在人民军的猛烈炮火下继续步行撤退。
    在和平城地区，人民军相继收复了墙山、芳林、松岗、巴曼和东丁等据点，并把敌人赶到听廊据点，在那里攻击并且歼灭了他们。和平城内许多地方都起了火，散布着敌军在匆忙撤退时所留下来的一些车辆和物资。二十三日下午，人民军完全解放了和平城。
    自从三个月以前法国侵略军侵犯和平城以后，仅在北越地区，敌人就损失了官兵约二万零五百人。和平城的解放，使前法国侵略军头子塔西尼想把战争扩大到和平城的计划完全破产。
