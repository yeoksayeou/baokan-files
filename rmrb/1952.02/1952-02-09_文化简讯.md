    To further strengthen ties with the Tibetan people and facilitate their work, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have established Tibetan language training classes in Lhasa. The classes have a total of over 800 students. In addition to cadres from the troops stationed in Tibet who specialize in Tibetan language, the instructors also include Awa Chazhu and Jiangluojiang, 19 figures from Tibetan cultural and educational circles, as well as some progressive figures from the Hui and Mongolian communities in Lhasa.
    The classes officially started on January 12th. At the opening ceremony, General Tan Guansan, Political Commissar of the troops stationed in Tibet, pointed out that learning Tibetan is to further unite the Tibetan people, more widely and deeply publicize the central government's ethnic policies, and thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Awa Chazhu, a 73-year-old Tibetan instructor, said at the meeting: "Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, we have the opportunity today for Han and Tibetan compatriots to teach and learn together." The instructors all expressed their determination to teach conscientiously, unite with each other, and learn from each other. The students all expressed their determination to study Tibetan diligently, serve the Tibetan people wholeheartedly, and build Tibet for a long time.
    In order to closely cooperate with the publicity of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, "Serial Pictorial" published a special issue on February 1st focusing on the anti-corruption struggle. The content includes serial pictures: "Everyone Exposes and Reports," "Refusal to Confess Does Not Escape the Net of Justice," "A Good Example in the Anti-Corruption Movement - Yu Chunyin," "Rats Running Across the Street, Everyone Shouts to Beat Them," and single pictures "Expose the Rumors of Unscrupulous Merchants," "On the Verge of Collapse," "Where to Escape," etc. In addition, five kinds of propaganda posters were published.
