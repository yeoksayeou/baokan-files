The victory of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation over the past two years has further deepened and consolidated the great and profound friendship between the Soviet people and the people of our country.

In order to exchange experiences in economic and cultural construction, the people of China and the Soviet Union have had many exchanges of cultural groups and individuals. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, from the Soviet cultural, scientific, and artistic workers delegation headed by Fadeyev and Simonov coming to China to congratulate, to the National Day celebration in 1951 when Solovyov, Ehrenburg, and other representatives came to China to observe the ceremony, there have been 23 visits to China by Soviet delegations or individuals in these two years. Our country, with Guo Moruo as the head of the delegation to the World Peace Congress, Ding Ling as the head of the Chinese people's delegation to celebrate the October Revolution, Lin Boqu and Shen Junru as the heads of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, and other people's organizations and various study groups, have visited the Soviet Union a total of 14 times. These visits have promoted mutual understanding between the people of China and the Soviet Union and enhanced brotherly friendship. After the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation returned to China after participating in the "May Day" celebrations in the Soviet Union, they reported to more than 4 million people in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and provinces under the jurisdiction of North China and Central South Administrative Regions, conveying the achievements of Soviet national construction and the friendship of the Soviet people.

Our vast number of people love Soviet works. In the past two years, a large number of Marxist-Leninist works and books introducing the Soviet Union have been translated and published nationwide, including 727 kinds of literary works alone. Almost all Soviet literary works that have won the Stalin Prize have been translated into Chinese. Works such as Serafimovich's "The Iron Flood" and Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" have various popular simplified editions adapted for readers with different levels of education. Simonov's "Days and Nights," Furmanov's "Chapayev," and Wasilewska's "The Rainbow" have all been made into comic strips and are warmly welcomed by workers, peasants, and children. Lecture notes by famous Soviet scholars such as Yudin, Giselev, Makarova, and Bodrev who came to China to lecture have been printed into special collections and sold well throughout the country. Our famous works are also welcomed in the Soviet Union. For example, Chairman Mao's "On Practice," Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism," as well as the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, A Brief History of Modern China, Modern History, etc., have been translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union. More of our famous literary works have been translated into Russian. Soviet bookstores display "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," "Changes in Li Village," "The Hurricane," "New Children's Heroes," as well as Lu Xun's short stories, essays, and so on. The Russian versions of "People's China," "China Pictorial," and "China Workers' Pictorial" are also loved by the vast number of Soviet people.

Soviet films and pictures have become the best teaching materials for the vast number of our people to learn from the Soviet Union. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the past two years, Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country have screened Soviet films more than 7,400 times, with more than 16.9 million viewers; held more than 14,000 Soviet picture exhibitions, with more than 3 million viewers; and holding small-scale Soviet picture exhibitions or mobile Soviet picture exhibitions in factories, schools, and streets has become a common and regular occurrence. The headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has organized and compiled more than 50,000 sets of various pictures introducing the Soviet Union for local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations. More than 90 Soviet feature films and more than 50 educational short films have been translated into Chinese and released or are preparing for release. Soviet film experts have also assisted Chinese filmmakers in producing three color documentary films: "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Liberated China," and "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains." Chinese films that have been translated into Russian and widely shown in the Soviet Union include "Daughters of China," "Invisible Front," "Boundless Radiance," "Steel Warriors," "The White-Haired Girl," and "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities." The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe stayed in the Soviet Union from November 1950 for a total of 120 days, performing 106 shows, with more than 270,000 viewers. The troupe's performance in the Soviet Union was filmed as a color art documentary.

Soviet music and drama are also increasingly loved by the vast number of our people. The headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Central People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a national "Soviet Music Radio Appreciation Concert," regularly and systematically introducing exemplary works from the Old Russia period to modern writers. Up to now, 28 sessions have been held. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the All-China Federation of Music Workers have jointly held 69 "Soviet Music Appreciation Evenings" in Beijing. In the past two years, theaters in major cities have staged Soviet dramas translated into Chinese, among which "The Russian Question," "The Voice of the American People," and "Cold War" powerfully exposed the brutality and insidiousness of American imperialism and played a role in propaganda and education during the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

    两年来中苏文化交流的成绩
    两年来中苏两国文化合作的胜利，已进一步加深和巩固了苏联人民与我国人民之间的伟大深厚的友谊。
    为了交流经济、文化建设的经验，中苏两国人民曾有多次的文化团体和个人往来。自中华人民共和国开国之日，以法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫为首的苏联文化科学艺术工作者代表团来华祝贺，到一九五一年国庆节索洛维耶夫、爱伦堡和其他代表来华观礼，在这两年内，苏联代表团或个人来华访问的共有二十三次。我国以郭沫若为首的出席世界保卫和平大会的代表团，以丁玲为首的中国人民庆祝十月革命代表团，以林伯渠、沈钧儒为首的中苏友好协会赴苏参加“五一”节观礼代表团，以及其他人民团体和各种学习团体，先后访问苏联共十四次。这些访问都促进了中苏两国人民彼此间的了解，增进了兄弟般的情谊。中苏友好协会赴苏参加“五一”节观礼代表团归国后，仅在北京、天津、上海、南京、广州各大城市及华北、中南两大行政区所辖各省，就向四百多万人作过报告，传达了苏联国家建设的成就和苏联人民的友谊。
    我国广大人民热爱着苏联著作。两年来全国大量翻译出版了马克思列宁主义著作和介绍苏联的书籍，其中仅文艺作品即达七百二十七种。所有获得斯大林奖金的苏联文学作品几乎全已译成了中文。绥拉菲莫维奇的“铁流”、奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等作品并已有适应不同文化程度读者的各种通俗节印本。西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”、富曼诺夫的“夏伯阳”和华西列夫斯卡的“虹”都被绘成了连环画，受到工农大众和儿童们的热烈欢迎。苏联著名学者尤金、吉谢列夫、马卡洛娃、包德列夫等来华讲学的讲义都已印成专集，畅销全国各地。我国著名著作在苏联也同样受到欢迎，如毛主席的“实践论”、刘少奇的“论国际主义与民族主义”以及中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领、中国近代史、现代史等都已在苏联被译成俄文出版。我国著名文艺作品被译成俄文的更多。苏联的书店里陈列着“太阳照在桑乾河上”、“李家庄的变迁”、“暴风骤雨”、“新儿女英雄传”以及鲁迅的短篇小说、杂文等等。俄文版“人民中国”、“人民画报”以及“中国工人画刊”，也受到苏联广大人民的喜爱。
    苏联电影和图片已成为我国广大人民学习苏联的最好的教材。据极不完全的统计，两年间全国各地中苏友好协会放映苏联电影共七千四百余场，观众一千六百九十多万人；举办苏联图片展览一万四千多次，观众三百万人以上；在工厂、学校及街头举办小型苏联图片展览或流动苏联图片展览已成为普遍、经常的事情。中苏友好协会总会为各地中苏友好协会组织编制的介绍苏联的各种图片已超过五万套。苏联影片译成华语上映或准备放映的有故事片九十多部，教育短片五十多部。苏联电影专家更协助我国电影工作者摄制了“中国人民的胜利”、
    “解放了的中国”、“锦绣河山”三部五彩文献纪录片。我国电影译成俄语在苏联广泛放映的有“中华女儿”、“无形的战线”、“光芒万丈”、“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“中国民族大团结”等片。中华杂技团在一九五○年十一月到苏联，共逗留一百二十天，表演一百零六场，观众达二十七万多人。该团在苏联的表演被拍摄为五彩艺术纪录片。
    苏联音乐、戏剧也日益受到我国广大人民的爱好。中苏友好协会总会和中央人民广播电台联合举办全国性的“苏联音乐广播欣赏会”，定期系统地介绍自旧俄时期到现代作家的典范作品，截止目前已举办二十八次。中苏友好协会、苏联对外文化协会和中华全国音乐工作者协会在京联合举办的“苏联音乐欣赏晚会”已有六十九次。两年来，各大城市剧院都上演了译成中文的苏联戏剧，其中尤以“俄罗斯问题”、“美国人民的呼声”、“冷战”等剧有力地揭穿了美帝国主义的残暴阴险，在抗美援朝运动中曾起了宣传教育作用。    （新华社）
