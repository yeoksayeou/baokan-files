The big capitalist Ni Xie Kui, manager of the private Yong'an Soap Factory in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, has been arrested by the government.

After the liberation of Nanchang, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance established the Gongnong Soap Factory in October 1949 to meet market needs. At that time, the capitalist Ni Xie Kui plotted to squeeze out the Gongnong Soap Factory. First, he stole the position of Chairman of the Nanchang Chemical Industry Association, and then used his power to threaten and entice small and medium-sized soap manufacturers, instructing them to use the method of "uniting and reducing prices" to attack the Gongnong Soap Factory. At the same time, he coerced small and medium-sized soap factories to jointly falsely accuse the Gongnong Soap Factory to the Central South Inspection Team. Even more, he spread rumors among the masses, saying: "The scale of the Gongnong Soap Factory is large, the scale of the Yong'an Soap Factory is small. If you have oil (the main raw material for making soap), please do not sell it to the Gongnong Soap Factory."

These methods did not succeed, so the capitalist Ni Xie Kui shamelessly used the methods of "sending in" and "pulling over" to continue his frantic attack on the Gongnong Soap Factory. First, Ni Xie Kui personally befriended Fu Junwu, the deputy director of the Gongnong Soap Factory. Ni Xie Kui was extremely attentive to Fu, constantly asking Fu if he needed this or that, pressing forward step by step. Fu Junwu was finally hit by the "sugar-coated bullets" of the illegal capitalist Ni Xie Kui. He was dizzy all day long, completely disarmed, and became a prisoner of the capitalist Ni Xie Kui. Fu Junwu privately lent public materials such as twenty bags of soda ash, more than a thousand kilograms of oil, and more than 12 million yuan of public funds to Ni for his use, causing serious losses to state property.

After the illegal capitalist Ni Xie Kui "pulled over" Fu Junwu, he then proceeded step by step to carry out a more malicious move. In March 1950, Ni Xie Kui sent his confidant technician Chu Wenji into the Gongnong Soap Factory through Fu Junwu. Before Chu went, Ni Xie Kui and several of his cronies held a small meeting for more than a week. Ni Xie Kui said to Chu Wenji: "Go boldly, find out their news, reduce the amount of alkali, make the soap bad, if there is cheap oil on the street, don't tell the factory, bring down the Gongnong Soap Factory! When that time comes, I will send you to Shanghai to study advanced technology. If you have no food to eat, I have some; if you have no money to use, I have some. Go!" After Chu Wenji arrived at the Gongnong Soap Factory, he initially made one or two pots of good soap, but after that, one pot was good and two pots were bad. From March to October 1950, he made more than ninety pots of bad soap, totaling more than 4,800 boxes, accumulating 900 million yuan in capital. Chu Wenji almost daily secretly reported the situation in the factory to Ni. Ni immediately broadcast widely outside: "Gongnong soap is bad!" As a result, the reputation of Gongnong soap was ruined, and no one bought it.

When the workers of the Gongnong Soap Factory saw that Chu Wenji had made the soap bad, and also discovered that Ni had invited Chu to dinner, they reported these situations to Fu Junwu. But Fu said: "Strive to educate him!" Fu Junwu never asked about the soap being made badly. After Fu Junwu was captured by the illegal capitalist, he completely lost the position of the working class, betrayed the interests of the state and the people, and became a traitor to the revolution.

The capitalist Ni Xie Kui used such shameless means to cause the Gongnong Soap Factory to lose more than 1.8 billion yuan, and finally brought the factory down.

After the Gongnong Soap Factory was brought down, the illegal capitalist Ni Xie Kui further arranged for the "Gongnong" and "Yong'an" soap factories to implement joint public-private ownership, stealing the assets of the public enterprise. After the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement was launched in a vigorous manner, the capitalist Ni Xie Kui could not escape the dragnet cast by the people and was captured by the heroic and skilled "tiger-beating team" composed of the working class.

    南昌市永安肥皂厂大奸商倪爕揆被逮捕
    倪犯用卑鄙恶毒的手段搞垮了公营工农肥皂厂，并窃夺了国家企业的资财
    江西省南昌市私营永安肥皂厂经理、大奸商倪爕揆已被政府逮捕。
    南昌解放后，江西省财政厅为了供应市场需要，在一九四九年十月开办了工农肥皂厂。那时，奸商倪爕揆便布置挤垮工农肥皂厂的阴谋。他先窃夺了南昌市化学业同业公会主任委员的职位，接着就利用职权，威胁利诱中小肥皂厂商，指使中小肥皂厂商用“联合起来，减低售价”的办法向工农肥皂厂进攻；同时，胁迫使中小肥皂厂联名向中南视察团诬告工农肥皂厂；更在群众中间大肆造谣说：“工农肥皂厂的秤大，永安肥皂厂的秤小，你们有油
    （制肥皂的主要原料）请不要到工农肥皂厂去卖。”
    这些办法都没有成功，奸商倪爕揆就卑鄙无耻地使用“派进来”和“拉过去”的办法，向工农肥皂厂继续疯狂地进攻。首先倪爕揆亲去结交工农肥皂厂副厂长傅君武。倪爕揆对傅殷勤备至，经常问傅要不要这，要不要那，步步进逼。傅君武终于被不法奸商倪爕揆的“糖衣炮弹”打中了，一天到晚昏头昏脑，完完全全被解除了武装，变成了奸商倪爕揆的俘虏。傅君武曾数次私自将公家的物资纯碱二十袋，油一千余斤及公款一千二百余万元凭白地借给倪使用，使国家财产遭受到严重的损失。
    不法奸商倪爕揆把傅君武“拉过去”以后，接着就有步骤地进行更恶毒的一着。在一九五○年三月，倪爕揆通过傅君武把他的亲信技师褚文集派进了工农肥皂厂。去前，倪爕揆和他的几个喽啰开了一个礼拜多的小会。倪爕揆向褚文集说：“大胆去吧，打听他们的消息，少放碱，把肥皂做坏，街上有便宜油不要给厂方讲，把工农肥皂厂搞垮！到那时我送你去上海学习高等技术。你没有饭吃，我有；没有钱用，我有。去吧！”褚文集到工农肥皂厂后，最初做了一二锅好肥皂，以后就是一锅好两锅坏，从一九五○年三月到十月，前后做坏肥皂九十锅以上，计四千八百多箱，积压资金九亿。褚文集差不多天天向倪密报厂中情况。倪即在外大肆广播：“工农肥皂是坏的！”结果使工农肥皂名声扫地，没人购买。
    工农肥皂厂工人看见褚文集把肥皂做坏了，又发现倪请褚吃饭，就把这些情况反映给傅君武。但傅却说：“争取教育吧！”肥皂作坏了，傅君武从未过问过。傅君武被不法奸商俘掳后，完全丧失了工人阶级的立场，出卖了国家人民利益，成了革命的叛徒。
    奸商倪爕揆采用了这样无耻的手段，使工农肥皂厂损失十八亿元以上，终于把这个厂搞垮了。
    工农肥皂厂被搞垮了后，不法奸商倪爕揆就进一步地布置使“工农”与“永安”两肥皂厂实行公私合营，窃夺了公营企业的资财。反贪污反盗窃运动轰轰烈烈地展开后，奸商倪爕揆终难逃脱人民撒下的天罗地网，被工人阶级所组成的英勇善战的“打虎队”擒获了。    （江西日报）
