After the People's Daily criticized the serious bureaucratic work style of certain leaders of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government on February 1st, Shao Shiping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and Vice-Chairmen Fan Shiren and Fang Zichun have made self-criticisms. Their self-criticisms are now published below:

After reading the article "The Bureaucratic Work Style of Certain Leaders of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government is Extremely Serious" published in the People's Daily on February 1st, we immediately convened responsible personnel from the Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Provincial People's Supervision Committee, the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, and the Provincial Civil Affairs Department and Personnel Department to conduct several serious studies under the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Everyone conducted a self-examination with a serious and heavy heart and attitude. We unanimously agreed that the People's Daily's criticism of our past serious mistakes and shortcomings was correct, and we sincerely accept it. Since the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, we have further recognized the serious bureaucratic, certain localist tendencies in financial matters, and illegal and undisciplined errors that existed in the past. This criticism by the People's Daily plays a significant role in helping us deeply recognize our mistakes and accelerate the correction of our leadership style. We and the Provincial People's Government are determined to make a further comprehensive review in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign.

Several Major Errors

(1) Regarding the Jinxi Error Incident. The main leading cadres of Jinxi County, under the situation of the national revolution's victory, were influenced by bourgeois ideology and gradually developed thoughts of paralysis, complacency, corruption, and pleasure-seeking, as well as a serious bureaucratic work style. As a result, a series of serious facts occurred, such as many cadres violating laws and regulations (individual cadres even developing to the point of betraying the revolution), corruption and degeneration, and even nearly half of the old cadres successively fleeing. Although some of the problems mentioned above were discovered in June 1950, and we also sent a telegram ordering investigation, we did not pursue it deeply at that time. It was not until mid-March 1951, when a complaint letter was forwarded by the Central-South Military and Political Committee, ordering us to investigate and deal with it, that it still did not arouse the attention it deserved. It was delayed until April 16th before the Fuzhou Special District was ordered to investigate and deal with it. On June 2nd, we received a "Report on Corruption and Waste by Cadres in Jinxi County" from the Special District, and we began to realize the seriousness of the Jinxi problem. On June 9th, the Provincial People's Supervision Committee, together with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, sent personnel to the county for inspection, discovering a series of serious problems (but some complex problems were not clarified. At that time, some leading cadres in the special district also did not have a consistent understanding of the seriousness of the Jinxi problem). In early July, the Provincial People's Supervision Committee and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party submitted a preliminary report on the joint inspection in June (this report proposed that some problems in Jinxi still needed to be thoroughly investigated by the Special District, and suggested that the Special District put forward opinions on how to handle them). We still failed to seize the issue in a timely manner. It was not until early August when we went to Lushan to attend the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province that the Jinxi error problem attracted our high attention. In the report and summary of the congress, the Suichuan error problem was used as a typical example (the Suichuan problem had been dealt with at the congress, and those who should be prosecuted had been arrested). At the same time, the seriousness of the Jinxi problem was also pointed out implicitly to warn and educate all comrades at the congress. The Fuzhou delegation also focused on using the Jinxi problem as an example to organize discussions and examine the ideological style of the party and government organization workers in the Fuzhou area. However, because some important details of the case had not been clarified, no opinions on how to handle it were put forward. After the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province ended in late August, we again ordered the Provincial People's Supervision Committee to continue the inspection in the county in early September together with personnel from the Central-South leading organs. It took more than 20 days before the problem was basically clarified. At that time, the leading organs of the Fuzhou Special District were instructed to put forward opinions on how to handle it first. The opinions of the leading organs of the Special District were sent to us on October 24th. At that time, the Provincial People's Procuratorate, under the order of the Central-South Procuratorial Branch, had to thoroughly investigate the case, and on November 17th, personnel were sent to continue the investigation before the entire case of collective corruption by Zhao Jianye, the secretary of the Jinxi County People's Government, and others was fully investigated. We delayed until December 29th before issuing a formal decision on how to handle it. Judging from the above factual process, our handling of this problem was delayed for a long time, and at the same time, the reasons for the delay in handling the case were not reported in a timely manner. The reasons, in addition to the fact that the case gradually developed and was gradually exposed, and we were always waiting for the materials to be complete, and failed to make timely conclusions on how to handle them according to the principle of deciding on each matter as it arose, the most important reason was the serious bureaucratic work style of our leadership.

(2) Regarding the chaotic phenomena of Jiangxi Province in grain and financial management, such as some violations of laws and regulations and destruction of the system. Before the Central-South Military and Political Committee's Finance and Economics Committee sent a clearing team to Jiangxi in January and February 1951, we had preliminary discovered and begun to pay attention to the erroneous behaviors of some regions in our province regarding financial and grain issues, such as spending recklessly and hiding funds, especially the confusion in the amount of public grain. When the Central-South Finance Committee clearing team came to the province, we simultaneously transferred more than 200 cadres to join the 50-plus members of the Central-South Finance Committee clearing team to conduct inspections in various regions in two phases. The first phase of the inspection came to an end at the end of April. After listening to the report from the inspection team, we further understood the seriousness of the problems existing in the financial and grain system in various regions of our province. Not only was there a large amount of insect damage, grain mold, and losses during transportation and processing in terms of grain, but there were also illegal and undisciplined phenomena in terms of finance, such as hiding funds, misappropriating public grain, falsely reporting accounts, withholding funds for business to make money, and corruption and waste. We also discovered chaotic phenomena such as self-printing meal tickets, issuing informal notes, and arbitrarily apportioning funds. At that time, based on the materials obtained, we separately notified the relevant special districts to re-inspect the discovered problems, seize the opportunity to handle them, and report to higher levels. We also thoroughly investigated the situation of insect damage and moldy public grain in various regions several times. In March and April, the Provincial Finance Committee issued several documents to strictly prohibit hiding funds. On April 12th, the Provincial People's Government issued a proclamation prohibiting apportionment of funds, and prosecuted and dealt with illegal problems such as the Gaoan Grain Bureau director's misappropriation of public grain, the Nanchang Hengyuan Rice Mill's theft and sale of public grain, and the corruption of the grain bureau directors of the two counties of Qianshan and Chongren. Our mistake lies in the fact that although we took the above-mentioned measures, some of these measures were not fully implemented due to bureaucracy, and at that time, we only focused on tracking down the hidden public grain (the quantity of hidden public grain that had been discovered in large quantities had been recovered, but there must still be some that had not been discovered), and rescuing insect-damaged and moldy public grain (the final loss of insect-damaged and moldy grain was actually more than 2 million catties). We did not emphasize the firm implementation of the overall financial and grain system and the serious implementation of financial discipline. Ideological and political leadership in financial and economic work was also extremely weak, especially the fact that cadres who generally violated financial and economic systems were rarely punished in a timely manner (for example, the county magistrate of Ganxian concealed public grain for use as office expenses without being punished. The county magistrate of Hukou used more than 300,000 catties of public grain for construction without being dealt with for a long time), so that many serious problems in financial and grain matters could not be overcome in a timely manner. For example, many people used funds for production speculation and trading. Peng Jialun, director of the Provincial Culture and Education Committee, successively used a total of 1.6 billion yuan of funds for production, used some people with political problems, and also ruined some cadres as a result. This is a prominent example. Many agencies at the provincial and local levels also have serious phenomena of embezzling state property to establish small family businesses, turning large public into small public. Many judicial and public security departments do not hand over fines and confiscated property to the state treasury, and use them on their own. For example, the Provincial Court used judicial fines to do rice business in Yuanzhou, and Hu Ziqing, director of the Water Public Security Bureau, arbitrarily sold two abandoned landing craft. In the management of timber, serious phenomena of indiscriminate felling also occurred in some places (such as the Ningdu Lianhua Mountain area, where military and political agencies and troops carried out shaved-head style felling on the mountains), destroying forest protection policies and infringing on the interests of the masses. In the exchange of native products, some erroneous behaviors of mutual blockade and violation of policies occurred. There were also serious wasteful phenomena of large-scale construction in Ji'an and other places. All of the above-mentioned serious problems have caused significant losses to our financial and economic work and have had some very bad political impacts. At the end of July, we received the "Inspection Report on Several Problems in Jiangxi's Financial and Grain Work" from the Central-South Military and Political Committee's Central-South People's Supervision Committee. At that time, we were attending the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province. The document was printed and distributed to various delegations during the congress, and it also pointed out that many of the shortcomings and errors raised in this document truly reflected the serious problems existing in the ideological style and leadership thinking of our cadres, which deserved our vigilance, and it was proposed that they must be thoroughly corrected. However, after the Party Congress ended, we only felt that most of the above-mentioned problems had been separately notified to the special districts for handling, and we wanted to thoroughly solve these problems in the ideological examination movement (the resolution of the Third Party Congress of Jiangxi Province was to launch a movement throughout the province with the main focus on anti-arrogance, slackness, detachment from class struggle, and anti-corruption and degeneration). Therefore, the province did not conduct further specific inspections, delaying for more than three months, and did not report to the Central-South Military and Political Committee and the Central-South Supervision Committee. Although the Central-South Military and Political Committee urged us to handle and report the situation three times in September and October, we always adopted a bureaucratic attitude, failed to personally supervise and inspect, and only circulated documents to relevant departments for processing. It was not until December 20th that the Provincial Finance Department drafted a processing report, but it was only reported to the Central-South Finance Department, and not to the Central-South Military and Political Committee in a timely manner, and even more so, it did not thoroughly investigate and further process each of the serious problems that had been discovered in financial and grain matters in order to strictly enforce financial discipline. As a result, it objectively formed an attitude of disregard and rejection of instructions and orders from higher levels, which fully demonstrated our extremely serious bureaucratic work style and the extreme error of being unorganized and undisciplined.

(3) Regarding the concealment and false reporting of the 1950 surplus civil affairs funds. We did indeed falsely report the entire surplus of 10.4 million catties of grain from the 1950 civil affairs funds (excluding subsidies for cadres' families and unemployment relief for workers, including the 6 million catties of grain later approved by the Central-South Military and Political Committee as funds for the Martyrs' Children's School in our province) as the 1950 final accounts to the Central-South leading organs in March 1951. The motivation at the time was: because we unilaterally considered that the entire country would tighten expenditures in 1951 and that funds might be reduced; at the same time, we considered that the province's finances were difficult, but the necessary expenditures for various undertakings were indispensable. Therefore, this kind of localist behavior that disregarded the overall interests and violated financial discipline occurred. In April, when the Central-South Military and Political Committee's Civil Affairs Department sent personnel to check the accounts, the Provincial Finance Department and the Civil Affairs Department believed that the above-mentioned falsely reported figures had no receipts or accounts and did not match the actual figures issued to various special districts. Therefore, they attempted to falsify the falsely reported figures. Later, because fake accounts could not be made in fact, they felt that the responsibility was serious and were afraid of being punished, so they used the falsely reported distribution list to perfunctorily deal with the personnel from the Central-South Civil Affairs Department on the pretext that the accounts from below had not yet been reported. When the personnel from the Central-South Civil Affairs Department were going to inspect the special districts, the Civil Affairs Department first sent cadres to the three special districts of Nanchang, Fuzhou, and Yuanzhou to notify them to acknowledge the accounts according to the falsely reported distribution figures of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department in order to cover up the loopholes. Although this matter was opposed by the above-mentioned three special districts at the time, we did not make a deep self-criticism of this extremely hateful illegal and undisciplined behavior in a timely manner. In November last year, when Comrade Shao Shiping went to Hankou to attend a meeting, Deputy Chairman Deng of the Central-South Military and Political Committee seriously raised the issue that our Provincial Civil Affairs Department had engaged in making false accounts. At that time, Comrade Shao Shiping only stated: "Although this is a serious error, it is only an attempt and has not become a reality." Later, he made a self-criticism at a certain meeting in the province, but it was not until after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign began that we further recognized the seriousness of this error, and initially made a self-criticism in the report to the Central-South leading organs and Chairman Mao of the Central Committee on January 15th regarding the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. Regarding the handling of the concealed surplus of civil affairs funds, because the Provincial Government successively lent out more than 40 million catties of grain during the spring famine last year, especially because the Central and Central-South leading organs cared for the people of our province and allocated some social welfare funds to our province, which solved the difficulties of the spring and summer famine and other relief efforts last year, this surplus grain was not used in the first half of last year. In June, we invested this batch of falsely reported and concealed surplus grain to set up a mechanized brick and tile factory. The purpose was of course for long-term social welfare production plans (not for organizational production). However, because we started from serious localism, we caused an unacceptable serious error of deceiving higher levels and violating financial discipline, which had a very bad impact on lower-level governments and staff, and also fueled the illegal and undisciplined behavior of many cadres. The responsibility for this matter should be entirely borne by us. As the People's Daily pointed out: "Who is the highest leader of the province?" That is us. In addition to sincerely requesting severe punishment from higher levels, we are conducting a thorough review of the detailed process of the incident with relevant personnel separately, and have decided to submit the reviews of each person to the Central-South leading organs and the Central Committee for review within a limited time.

Ideological Roots of Mistakes

Judging from the above error examples and the typical events of the degeneration of the party and government organizations of Suichuan County and the majority of responsible cadres of Jinxi County in our province, as well as the many serious facts of corruption and waste discovered since the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, we did indeed have very serious bureaucracy and localist tendencies in the past, as well as unorganized and undisciplined ideological styles, which caused considerable losses to the political prestige of the People's Government among the people and to the work of our province. Our bureaucratic error, as pointed out by the Changjiang Daily, is not only that many erroneous phenomena in our province were not discovered in a timely manner, but the serious thing is that many problems that have been discovered were not seriously and timely dealt with, which shows that we lack a responsible attitude towards the people's cause. For example, the financial inspection team organized by the Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Military and Political Committee reported to us on some serious problems in our province's financial work in April and May 1951, and we also issued several orders, instructions, and proclamations to correct and handle them. But why have the problems not been completely resolved? This is mainly because our work style is not in-depth, especially lacking inspection, and we know little about the situation below. We often stay on top of issuing announcements, orders, instructions, approving documents, and writing resolutions. This is the specific manifestation of serious bureaucracy. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "The correct organization of the work of reviewing the implementation situation is of decisive significance in the struggle against bureaucracy and formalism. ... It can be said with certainty that nine out of ten of our shortcomings and defects are due to the lack of properly organized work of reviewing the implementation situation." However, this is exactly what we did. We issued orders, gave instructions, and made decisions, but rarely actually organized to check the implementation situation. In fact, many of our instructions and orders have long become documents or routine matters, forming an indefinite document journey. We will cite such an example, which will be amazing. For example, on September 13 last year, the Central-South Military and Political Committee sent a telegram urging the investigation and handling results of our province's financial and grain inspection, limiting us to report by the 20th of the same month, with a time limit of only seven days; but we only forwarded it to the Provincial Finance Committee, and the Finance Committee forwarded it to the Finance Department; the Finance Department actually shelved this telegram (it was not until this inspection of this telegram that it was found out), and we have not urged and checked it. Just imagine: is there any more shocking bureaucracy than this? In particular, we have taken such a disregard attitude towards matters that higher levels have urged us to handle within a limited time. Can this still be tolerated? At the same time, in our work, we also lack a vigorous and resolute spirit. Many things are dragged on and on. For example, the Jinxi problem, from the entire process, we have been continuing to inspect and handle it, but it has been delayed for as long as eight months before finally being handled. In our provincial People's Government, there is also a lack of due cooperation between upper and lower levels and between departments. Many things are waiting for each other, wasting time and wasting days. The above-mentioned very serious bureaucratic ideological style is the first reason for our mistakes.

Secondly, due to the localist tendencies in our thinking, we have an insufficient understanding of the new situation of unprecedented unity and concentration after the establishment of the national people's regime, and our thinking still retains some outdated concepts of decentralized management from the past divided rural base areas. Therefore, we sometimes unilaterally emphasized the local and partial difficulties, and did not understand that under the new situation and conditions of the unified national regime, the local difficulties of any place can only be resolved on the premise of resolutely implementing the unified decisions of the Central Committee; if we emphasize local interests and violate and harm centralized unity, not only will the local difficulties not be truly resolved, but more importantly, the overall interests will inevitably be harmed. Facts have proved that this kind of localist ideological tendency has produced serious adverse consequences of varying degrees in many places in the province. Not only has the financial system and economic policies not been well implemented, but some bad political influences have been produced, many cadres have been ruined, and the revolutionary organization and discipline have been relaxed. If this continues to develop, it will inevitably disperse and destroy the strength and plans for national unified construction, which is very dangerous. This localist ideological tendency is the second reason for our mistakes.

Finally, the most basic ideological root of our mistakes is that we failed to timely understand and grasp Chairman Mao's profound instructions at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. On the one hand, we underestimated and failed to prevent the various erroneous tendencies that may arise within our revolutionary ranks during the great historical transition period from war to peace and from rural to urban areas after the national revolution's victory; at the same time, we lacked sufficient understanding and vigilance about the danger of the bourgeoisie invading the revolutionary ranks; on the other hand, we lacked sufficient understanding of the need to more closely contact and rely on the people and to more vigorously promote criticism and self-criticism after seizing national power. Therefore, our ideological and political leadership in our work is weak, and we do not pay enough attention to the ideological and political education and ideological transformation of cadres. At the same time, because we failed to fully promote a democratic work style and did not pay enough attention to the work of people's supervision, the people's supervision institutions have long been in an unsound state, so that we cannot fully mobilize the broad masses of people to supervise the work of government staff, so many of our shortcomings and errors in our work are not easy to discover and correct in a timely manner.

The above are the main ideological roots of our errors and shortcomings, and they are also the major lessons we must firmly remember. We believe that as long as we resolutely take the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee, and the Central-South leading organs, can earnestly remember these major lessons, and take effective measures to thoroughly work hard, our errors will surely be quickly corrected and new progress will be made, and our future work will surely have new developments.

Measures to Correct Errors

In addition to thanking the Central Committee and the Central-South leading organs for their continuous help and education and the criticism given to us by the People's Daily this time, we believe that resolutely implementing the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy called for by Chairman Mao plays a decisive role in correcting our past serious erroneous thoughts and behaviors. If this is not the case, not only will we continue to make more serious errors, but also our future work will suffer more significant losses. Therefore, we very sincerely accept the painful lessons of this mistake and are determined to take the following measures to correct the errors in our leadership and work.

1. Resolutely carry through the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign to the end, and are determined to make a systematic, comprehensive, and thorough examination of our leadership thinking style in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. We plan to convene meetings of the government committee, special commissioner, city, and county heads, the provincial consultative committee, and office cadres after the "tiger beating" campaign in provincial-level organs is over. We will make deep self-criticisms, highly promote democracy, launch criticism and self-criticism, and make written self-criticisms to be distributed to various special, city, and county levels. We will also instruct various special, city, and county levels to conduct similar self-criticisms based on the spirit of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. In the step-by-step inspection from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the chiefs must take the lead and conduct self-criticisms at each level. The purpose is not only to completely eradicate corruption and waste, but also to focus on exposing and overcoming the bureaucratic, localist, unorganized, and undisciplined errors of the leadership that are divorced from reality and the masses, to achieve the establishment of a democratic style, a self-criticism style, and an honest and public-serving style that is closely linked with the people and closely linked with reality.

2. Strengthen ideological and political leadership and conduct regular study and education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Among the leading personnel of government departments at all levels, in all work, we must emphasize that ideological leadership is the top priority. We must regularly and periodically understand the ideological situation of cadres and the masses of people in various periods, and we must timely discover and correct ideological deviations, and constantly improve the ideological level of the people and cadres. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, special attention should be paid to educating and alerting all cadres with the ugly crimes of the bourgeoisie attacking all aspects of the people's cause and the harm of the bourgeoisie's corrupt and degenerate thoughts to the revolution, in order to draw a clear line between the ideological boundaries of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and to achieve the purification and consolidation of the revolutionary ranks from the ideological level.

3. Resolutely launch and implement a serious struggle against violations of laws and discipline, strengthen legal and disciplinary education, and all personnel who violate laws and discipline must be thoroughly investigated and resolutely and promptly dealt with according to different circumstances in order to rectify the law and discipline. Any accommodation and indulgence must be resolutely opposed.

4. Establish and improve people's supervision and inspection institutions at all levels as soon as possible within a limited time and quickly equip them with capable cadres to strengthen their organization and work in order to give play to the important role of the people's supervision system.

Finally, in order to strictly enforce discipline and educate us and the cadres of the entire province, we sincerely request the Central Committee and the Central-South leading organs to give us severe punishment.

    江西省人民政府主席邵式平，副主席范式人、方志纯
    关于官僚主义作风的检讨
    本报二月一日对江西省人民政府某些领导人员的官僚主义作风提出批评后，江西省人民政府主席邵式平，副主席范式人、方志纯已作出检讨，现在将他们的检讨发表于下：
    我们看了人民日报二月一日所载“江西省人民政府某些领导人员官僚主义作风十分严重”一文后，立即召集了省人民检察署、省人民监察委员会、省财政经济委员会和省府民政厅、人事厅等有关单位的负责人员，在中共江西省委领导下，几次认真地研究了人民日报这一批评。大家以严肃沉重的心情和态度进行了自我检讨。一致认为人民日报对我们过去所犯的重大错误和缺点的批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以来，我们对过去所存在的严重的官僚主义、财政问题上的某些本位主义偏向和违法乱纪等错误，已有了进一步的认识。人民日报这一次批评，对帮助我们深刻认识自己的错误和加速改正我们的领导作风有重大的作用。我们和省人民政府决心在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中作进一步的全盘检讨。
    几个重大的错误事件
    （一）关于金溪错误事件问题。金溪县主要领导干部，在全国革命胜利的形势下，受了资产阶级思想的侵袭，逐渐滋长了麻痹轻敌、腐化享乐的思想和严重的官僚主义作风，因而发生了许多干部违法乱纪（有个别干部发展到背叛革命）、贪污蜕化，甚至近半数老干部相继逃跑等一系列的严重事实。上述错误中的某些问题，虽在一九五零年六月即有所发现，我们也曾电令查究，但当时并未深追。直到一九五一年三月中旬，由中南军政委员会转来控告信一封，并令我们查处，仍未引起我们应有的重视，延至四月十六日才令抚州专署查处。六月二日收到专署“关于金溪县干部贪污浪费的报告”，我们开始认识到金溪问题的严重。六月九日，省人民监察委员会会同中共江西省委纪律检查委员会派员前往该县检查，发现了一系列的严重问题（但有些复杂问题未搞清楚。当时该专区部分领导干部对金溪问题的严重性也还认识不一致）。七月初省人民监察委员会、中共江西省委纪律检查委员会已将六月间联合检查的初步报告（此一报告提出金溪有些问题尚须由专署继续彻查，并提议由专署提出处理意见）交给我们，而我们对此问题仍未及时抓紧处理。直到八月初我们去庐山参加中共江西省第三次党代表会议时，才对金溪错误问题引起了高度重视。在该会议的报告和总结中，曾以遂川错误问题为典型（遂川问题在该会议中已作处理，应法办的人员已经逮捕），同时也曾不指明地指出了金溪问题的严重性，以警惕和教育大会全体同志。抚州代表团也曾着重以金溪问题为例组织了讨论，检查了抚州地区党和政府的组织的工作人员的思想作风，但因对该案一些重要情节尚未查明，故未提出处理意见。中共江西省第三次党代表会议在八月底结束后，我们在九月初又令省人民监察委员会再度协同中南领导机关来员赴该县继续检查，历时二十余天，问题才基本查清。当时曾指令抚州专区领导机关先行提出处理意见。专区领导机关的处理意见在十月二十四日送给我们，是时省人民检察署又奉中南检察分署之命须彻查该案，乃于十一月十七日又派人继续调查，才将该县人民政府秘书赵建业等集体贪污案件全部查清。我们拖延到十二月二十九日才发出正式处理决定。从上述事实经过看来，我们对此问题处理迟迟拖延不决，同时又未将该案处理迟缓原因及时上报，其原因除由于案情逐渐发展逐渐暴露，老是等待材料齐全，未按一事一决的原则及时作出处理结论外，最主要的是由于我们领导上严重的官僚主义作风所造成。
    （二）关于江西省在粮食和财政管理方面若干违法乱纪破坏制度的混乱现象问题。我们于一九五一年一、二月间中南军政委员会财政经济委员会派清查组来江西以前，对我省各地在财粮问题上某些乱支乱用打埋伏等错误行为，特别是公粮数目上的混乱，已有初步发现，并开始予以注意。中南财委清查组来省时，我们即同时抽调了干部二百余人会同中南财委清查组五十余人分两期到各地进行检查。第一期检查四月底告一段落。我们听了检查组的汇报，进一步了解到我省各地财粮制度上所存在的问题的严重。不但在粮食方面有大量虫害、粮食霉烂、调运和加工中的损失；财政上存在着打埋伏、挪用公粮、虚报账目、扣押事业费作生意、贪污浪费等违法乱纪现象，而且也发现了自印饭票、乱开条子、乱摊派等混乱现象。当时我们曾就所得材料，分别通知有关专署对所发现的问题再行检查，抓紧处理并报上级，又曾先后数次彻查各地虫害、霉烂公粮的情形。三、四月间由省财委发出了几次文电严禁打埋伏。四月十二日由省人民政府发布了禁止摊派的布告，并对高安粮食局长挪用公粮，南昌恒元米厂盗卖公粮，与铅山、崇仁两县粮食局长贪污等违法问题加以法办。我们的错误在于虽然采取了上述措施，但由于官僚主义作怪，这些措施有些并未完全贯彻，而且在当时只偏重于追查打埋伏的公粮（已发现的打埋伏公粮数量较大者均已追回，但一定还有未发现的），抢救虫害、霉烂公粮（虫害、烂霉粮最后查出实损失二百余万斤）等方面，对于全盘财粮制度的坚决贯彻，财政纪律的认真执行，并未予以强调，财经工作上的思想政治领导也极为薄弱，特别是对一般违反财经制度的干部很少及时处分（如赣县县长隐瞒公粮用作机关开支，没有处理。湖口县长私用公粮三十余万斤作修建，也拖延很久未处理），以致财粮问题上的许多严重问题未能及时克服。如用事业费做生产投机买卖的很多，省文化教育委员会主任彭加伦先后动用合计十六亿元事业费作生产，引用了一些有政治问题的人，并也因此断送了某些干部，这就是一个显著的例证。省级和各地不少机关，也有套取国家财物建立小家务，化大公为小公的严重现象。司法、公安部门对罚款和没收的财物不交国库，自行动用者甚多。如省法院以司法罚款到袁州做大米生意，水上公安局长胡子清擅卖废登陆艇两只。在木材经营管理上，部分地方也发生了乱砍乱伐的严重现象（如宁都莲花山地区，军政机关部队在山上进行了剃头式的砍伐），破坏了护林政策，侵犯了群众利益。在土产交流上，曾发生了一些互相封锁违反政策的错误行为。还有吉安等地大肆修建的严重浪费现象。所有上述严重问题，都给了我们财经工作上以重大损失，并在政治上造成了一些很恶劣的影响。七月底接到中南军政委员会发来中南人民监察委员会“关于江西财粮工作中几个问题的检查报告”，当时我们正出席中共江西省第三次党代表会议，会议中曾将此文件印发各代表团，也指出了这一文件中所提出的许多缺点错误，确实反映了我们干部思想作风上与领导思想上存在的严重问题，值得我们引起警惕，并提出必须彻底纠正。但是在党代表会结束后，我们只是感到上述问题多数已曾分别通知各专署处理，并想在思想检查运动中再彻底解决这些问题（江西省三届党代表会决议以反骄傲松劲脱离阶级斗争与反贪污腐化倾向为主在全省展开一个运动）。因此，省里没有再作进一步的具体检查，一直拖延了三个多月之久，也未向中南军政委员会和中南监察委员会作过报告。虽经中南军政委员会于九、十月间先后三次催促我们办理具报，我们始终采取官僚主义的态度，未能亲自负责督促检查，只在公文上兜圈子，批转给有关部门处理。直到十二月二十日才由省财政厅拟了一个处理报告，但只报到中南财政部，未及时呈报中南军政委员会，更没有针对财粮问题上已发现的各项尚未解决的严重问题逐一清查，进一步进行处理，以严格执行财政纪律，以致客观上形成对上级指示和命令的漠视和拒绝的态度，这充分表现了我们十分严重的官僚主义作风和无组织无纪律的极端错误。
    （三）关于隐瞒假报一九五零年节余民政事业费问题。我们确曾于一九五一年三月将一九五零年度节余的民政事业费粮一千零四十余万斤（除干部家属补助粮和工人失业救济粮外，包括后来经中南军政委员会批准，拨给我省烈士子弟学校经费六百万斤粮食在内），全部当作一九五零年的决算浮报中南领导机关。当时的动机是：因为片面地顾虑到一九五一年整个国家要紧缩开支，事业费可能减少；同时又顾虑到本省财政困难，而各种事业的必要开支不可缺少。因此，就发生了这种从局部利益出发，不顾整体利益的本位主义和违反财经纪律的恶劣行为。至四月间中南军政委员会民政部派员前来检查账目，当时省财政厅和民政厅认为上述浮报数字既无单据账目又和实发各专署数字不符，因此，曾企图将浮报数字造假账。后因事实上假账不能造，感到责任严重，怕受处分，乃藉口下面账目尚未报来，竟以浮报之分配表向中南民政部来员敷衍应付。当中南民政部来员要去专署检查时，民政厅即先派干部去南昌、抚州、袁州三专署通知他们按省民政厅浮报分配数字认账，以掩饰漏洞。当时此事虽曾遭到上述三专署之反对，但我们未及时对此极端可憎的违法乱纪的行为作深刻的自我检讨。去年十一月间，邵式平同志到汉口开会时，中南军政委员会邓副主席曾严肃提出我省民政厅有造假账行为，当时邵式平同志仅声明：“这虽是严重错误，但只是有此企图，未成事实”，后又在省里某次会议上作过检讨，但直至反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，我们才进一步认识这一错误的严重性，并于一月十五日给中南领导机关和中央毛主席的关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的报告中，初步进行了检讨。关于隐瞒的民政事业费节余之处理，由于去年春荒时，省府先后贷出四千余万斤粮食，特别是由于中央及中南领导机关对我省人民关怀，又拨给了我省一部社会事业费，解决了我省去年春夏荒及其他救济事业的困难，故这笔节余粮，去年上半年未曾动用，我们在六月间才将这批浮报隐瞒的节余粮，投资办一机制砖瓦厂，其目的固然是为了社会事业生产作长期打算（并非为了机关生产），然而由于我们从严重的本位主义出发，以致造成瞒骗上级，违反财政纪律的不可容许的严重错误，给了下级政府及工作人员极坏的影响，并且助长了许多干部违法乱纪的行为。追究此事责任，应完全由我们负责。人民日报所指出：“省的最高首长究竟是谁”这就是我们。我们除竭诚请求上级严重处分外，关于该事件详细经过，我们正在和有关人员分别作彻底检讨，并决定限期将各人检讨分呈中南领导机关和中央审查。
    犯错误的思想根源
    从上述错误事例和我省遂川县党政组织，金溪县多数负责干部堕落蜕化的典型事件，以及自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以来所发现的许多严重的贪污浪费事实看来，我们过去确实存在着十分严重的官僚主义和本位主义偏向，以及无组织无纪律的思想作风，使人民政府在人民群众中的政治威信和我省工作受到不少损失。我们的官僚主义错误正如长江日报所指出的不仅是在于我省的许多错误现象未能及时发现，而严重的还在于已发现了的许多问题，未认真及时处理，这说明我们对人民事业，缺乏认真负责的态度。如中南局和中南军政委员会组织的财政检查组已将我省财政工作的若干严重问题于一九五一年四、五月时向我们汇报过，我们也曾因此发过数次命令、指示、布告进行纠正和处理，但是为什么问题还没有彻底解决呢？这主要是因为我们的工作作风不深入，尤其缺乏检查，了解下情少，常常停留在发布告、命令、指示和批公文、写决议上面，这正是严重的官僚主义的具体表现。斯大林同志曾指出过：“正确组织审查执行情形的工作，这在反对官僚主义和反对形式主义的斗争中是有决定意义的。……可以肯定说，我们的缺点与缺陷，十分之九都是由于缺乏组织得正确的审查执行情形的工作。”然而我们正是这样，发了命令，下了指示，作了决定，却很少切实组织检查执行的情形。事实上我们不少的指示和命令早已变成公文或例行公事，形成无限期地公文旅行，我们举这样一个例子，就会令人惊异。如去年九月十三日，中南军政委员会发来的关于催查我省财粮检查处理结果的电报，限我们于同月二十日前具报，限期只有七天；而我们只是照转省财委，财委又照转财政厅；财政厅竟将这一电示束之高阁（一直到这次检查此电示时才查明），我们也一直没有督促检查。试想：还有比这样更骇人听闻的官僚主义吗？特别是对上级限期催办的事，我们竟然采取了这样的漠视态度，这还能容忍吗？同时在我们的工作上，也缺乏雷厉风行的精神，许多事情拖拖拉拉，例如金溪问题，从整个过程看，我们一直在继续检查处理，但却一直拖延八个月之久，才最后处理。在我们省人民政府内部上下级之间、各部门之间的关系上，也缺乏应有的配合，许多事情互相等待、旷时废日。上述这种十分严重的官僚主义的思想作风，是造成我们犯错误的第一个原因。
    其次，由于我们思想上存在着本位主义偏向，对于全国人民政权建立以后，空前统一集中的新形势认识不足，我们的思想还残留着过去那种分割的农村根据地时期分散经营的一些陈旧观念。因此有时就片面地强调了地方的局部困难，不了解在全国政权统一的新形势和条件下，任何地方的局部困难，只有在坚决贯彻中央统一的决定的前提下，才能得到解决；如果强调了局部利益，违背和妨害了集中统一，不仅局部的困难得不到真正的解决，更重要的是全局利益也必然受到损害。事实证明，这种本位主义的思想偏向，已在本省许多地方产生了程度不同的严重恶果。不仅使财政制度经济政策不能很好贯彻，政治上产生了一些坏影响，断送了不少干部，松懈了革命的组织和纪律，如果发展下去，则必然会分散和破坏国家统一建设的力量和计划，这是十分危险的。这种本位主义的思想偏向，是造成我们犯错误的第二个原因。
    最后，我们之所以犯错误，思想上的最基本的根源是由于我们对于毛主席在二中全会上的深刻指示，未能及时领会和掌握。一方面，对于全国革命胜利后由战争到和平，由农村到城市这一伟大的历史转变时期中，我们的革命队伍内部可能产生的各种错误偏向估计和预防不足；同时，对于资产阶级向革命队伍侵袭的危险也缺少足够的认识和警惕；另一方面对于在夺取了全国政权以后，需要更加密切联系和依靠人民群众，需要更加发扬批评和自我批评认识不够。因此我们在工作中的思想政治领导薄弱，对干部的思想政治教育思想改造重视不够。同时由于我们未能充分发扬民主作风，对人民监察工作重视不够，人民监察机构长期处于不健全的状态，以致不能充分发动广大人民群众监督政府的工作人员，因而我们工作上的许多缺点和错误，也就不易及时发现和纠正。
    上述各项就是我们产生错误和缺点的主要思想根源，也是我们必须牢牢记取的重大教训。我们相信：只要我们坚决在毛主席、中央、中南领导机关的正确领导下，能切实记取这些重大教训，并采取有效措施加以彻底努力，我们的错误一定能够迅速改正并取得新的进步，今后的工作也一定会有新的发展。
    纠正错误的措施
    我们除了感谢中央、中南领导方面不断给我们的帮助教育及这次人民日报给我们的批评外，我们认为坚决贯彻毛主席号召的增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，对纠正我们过去的严重错误思想和行为，有决定作用。如果不是这样的话，不仅我们将会继续犯更严重的错误，而且将会使我们今后的工作遭受更重大的损失。因此，我们十分诚恳接受这次犯错误的沉痛教训并决心采取下列措施，以纠正我们领导方面和工作方面的错误。
    1、坚决将反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动贯彻到底，决心在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中对自己的领导思想作风作一系统的、全面的、彻底的检查。我们拟在省一级机关“打虎”运动结束后，即召开政府委员会，专员、市、县长联席会，省协商委员会，机关干部等会议，由我们作深刻的检讨，高度发扬民主，展开批评和自我批评，并作出书面检讨发至各专、市、县，并责成各专、市、县根据反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义精神作同样检讨，在由上而下、由下而上的逐级检查中，必须首长带头，层层检讨。其目的除要彻底根绝贪污浪费现象外，还要着重揭露和克服领导方面脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义以及本位主义和无组织无纪律的错误，达到确立和人民群众密切联系，和实际密切联系的民主作风，自我批评的作风，廉洁奉公的作风。
    2、加强思想、政治领导和进行经常的马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习和教育。在各级政府部门领导人员中，在一切工作中，必须强调把思想领导当作头等任务。要经常地定期地了解各个时期中干部及人民群众的思想情况，要及时发现和纠正思想偏差，不断提高人民和干部思想水平。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，应特别注意以资产阶级向人民事业各方面进攻的丑恶罪行和资产阶级腐化堕落思想对于革命的危害性，教育和警惕所有干部，以划清资产阶级和无产阶级的思想界限，达到从思想上来纯洁和巩固革命队伍。
    3、要坚决展开和贯彻反对违法乱纪的严肃斗争，加强法纪教育，对一切违法乱纪的人员，必须彻查到底，并根据不同情节坚决迅速处理，以整饬法纪。任何迁就姑息，必须坚决反对。
    4、尽速限期建立和健全各级人民监察机构和检查机构并迅速配备得力干部，加强其组织和工作以便发挥人民监察制度的重大作用。
    最后，为了严申纪律，教育我们以及全省干部，我们竭诚请求中央和中南领导机关给我们以严重的处分。
