Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 25th: Our front-line reporter reports: All commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with unparalleled anger, resolutely protest the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare in Korea. The soldiers guarding the blocking front closely monitor the enemy in front of them, preparing to strike invading troops at any time. Simultaneously, they hold meetings in the trenches to denounce the crimes of the American aggressors. They unanimously believe that the American imperialists not only use aircraft and artillery for indiscriminate bombing and shelling in Korea, and continuously release poison gas, but now even use bacteriological weapons. This fully proves that American imperialism is the most ferocious and cruel enemy of the people.

The Volunteer Army soldiers guarding the perimeter of the Panmunjom armistice negotiation venue are even more resentful. They vehemently condemn the American aggressors for delaying the armistice negotiations while simultaneously dealing such a cruel blow to the Korean-Chinese People's Army and the Korean people. This proves that the American aggressors are extremely hostile to the world's people's desire for peace.

Soldiers from Rehe Province who had personally suffered from the Japanese fascists spreading bacteria are even more outraged by the American aggressors' large-scale use of bacteriological weapons. They all realize that American imperialism is even more vicious than Japanese fascism. Soldier Deng Anxin said: "When the Japanese fascists spread bacteria in my hometown, they almost killed my mother; today, American imperialism wants to use bacteria to kill the Chinese and Korean People's Army and the Korean people. Old hatreds are compounded by new ones. I must avenge this!"

The commanders and combatants of the Volunteer Army are all confident that, although the American aggressors want to use bacteriological warfare to salvage their failure in Korea, all their adventures are in vain. The gunners of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, who have shot down or damaged 173 enemy planes, said: "The enemy's boasted air and sea superiority did not save them from failure. Today, they are using such a poisonous scheme, which will definitely not save them from their final crushing defeat." The political instructor of the "38th Parallel Sharp Knife Hero Company" of a certain Volunteer Army unit said: "The Chinese people once defeated the Japanese imperialists who used bacteriological weapons. Today, we will certainly be able to crush the new conspiracy of the American aggressors. We have the support of the people of the world, and our strength is infinite!"

The front-line officers and soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to fight more bravely and demanded that the American war criminals who used bacteriological weapons be severely punished.

    我志愿军全体指战员无比愤怒
    决心严惩使用细菌武器的敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】本社前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员以无比的愤怒，坚决抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战争的滔天罪行。守卫在阻击战线上的战士们严密地监视着当面的敌人，准备随时打击进犯军，同时他们在战壕中纷纷集会声讨美国侵略者的罪行。他们一致认为：美帝国主义在朝鲜不但使用飞机大炮滥施轰炸射击，并不断施放毒气，而现在竟使用起细菌武器来，这充分证明美帝国主义是最凶恶最残暴的人民的死敌。
    守卫在板门店停战谈判会场区外围前线的志愿军战士们更是愤恨万分。他们痛斥美国侵略者一面在拖延停战谈判，同时却对朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民下这样凶狠的毒手，这证明了美国侵略者对世界人民的和平愿望是非常仇视的。
    来自热河省的战士们曾亲身遭受过日本法西斯散布细菌的毒害，他们对于美国侵略者大规模地使用细菌武器的血腥罪行更是怒不可遏，他们都认识到美帝国主义比日本法西斯还要毒辣。战士邓安新说：“日本法西斯在我们家乡撒布细菌时差一点把我母亲害死；今天美帝国主义想用细菌来杀害中朝人民军队和朝鲜人民，旧恨添新仇，我一定要报仇雪恨！”
    志愿军的指挥员和战斗员都信心百倍地提出：尽管美国侵略者想用细菌战争来挽救它在朝鲜的失败，但他们的一切冒险都是徒然的。曾经击落击伤敌机一百七十三架的某高射炮部队的炮手们说：“敌人吹嘘的海空优势没有挽救他们的失败，今天他们又使用出这种毒计，这也决不能挽救他们的最后惨败。”志愿军某部“三八线尖刀英雄连”政治指导员说：“中国人民曾经打败了使用细菌武器的日本帝国主义，今天我们也一定能够粉碎美国侵略者的新阴谋，我们有全世界人民的支持，我们的力量是无穷的！”
    前线将士们一致表示要更英勇地作战，并且要求严办使用细菌武器的美国战争罪犯。
