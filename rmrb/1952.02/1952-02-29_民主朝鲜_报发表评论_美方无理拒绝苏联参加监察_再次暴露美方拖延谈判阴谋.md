    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 28th: "Democratic Korea" newspaper published a commentary on the 24th, condemning the US side's unreasonable opposition to the Soviet Union's participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The commentary said: The Soviet Union is adjacent to the Korean territory and has consistently advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Soviet Union is fully qualified as a neutral nation. If the US side is willing to make the armistice negotiations a success instead of continuing to delay and undermine them, there is no reason whatsoever to oppose our proposal to invite the Soviet Union as a neutral nation.

    The commentary emphasized that the US side is afraid of the Soviet Union's participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission because the Soviet Union has consistently upheld truth and justice, relentlessly exposed the various conspiracies of the aggressors, and faithfully defended world peace and the interests of the Korean people. The commentary said: The fact that the United States is alarmed by our invitation to the Soviet Union to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission once again exposes the US side's consistent conspiracy to delay the armistice negotiations before the people of the world. The commentary concluded: The aggressors must know that rejecting the Soviet Union's participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a manifestation of opposition to peace-loving people all over the world who yearn for peace and security. The peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is the common aspiration of the people of the world and is closely related to the vital interests of the people of the world. Can one refuse the Soviet Union, which represents the common interests of peace-loving people all over the world, to participate in the supervision when implementing the Korean armistice agreement? The US side must quickly accept our legitimate proposal. This clumsy trick of the US side is absolutely doomed to fail.

    “民主朝鲜”报发表评论
    美方无理拒绝苏联参加监察
    再次暴露美方拖延谈判阴谋
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】“民主朝鲜”报于二十四日发表评论，斥责美方无理反对苏联参加中立国监察委员会。评论说：苏联与朝鲜国土毗连，而且一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题。苏联完全符合中立国的资格。如果美方愿意使停战谈判成功而不继续加以拖延和破坏，那就没有任何理由反对我方邀请苏联为中立国的提案。
    评论强调指出：美方之所以害怕苏联参加中立国监察委员会，是因为苏联一贯地拥护真理和正义，并无情地揭露侵略者的各种各样的阴谋，忠实地保卫世界和平与朝鲜人民的利益。评论说：美国因我方邀请苏联参加中立国监察委员会而惊慌的事实，又一次在全世界人民面前暴露了美方拖延停战谈判的一贯阴谋。评论最后说：侵略者必须知道：拒绝苏联参加中立国监察委员会，就是反对渴望和平与安全的全世界爱好和平人民的表现。朝鲜问题的和平解决是全世界人民的共同愿望，是和全世界人民的切身利益有着密切关连的。在履行朝鲜停战协定时能够拒绝代表着全世界爱好和平人民共同利益的苏联参加监察吗？美方必须迅速接受我方的正当提议。美方这种拙劣伎俩是绝对不能得逞的。
