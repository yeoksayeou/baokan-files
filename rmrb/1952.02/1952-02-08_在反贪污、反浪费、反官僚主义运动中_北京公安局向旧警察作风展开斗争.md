In consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, safeguarding the security of the capital and the people's lives and property, and maintaining the order of social revolution, the public security personnel in Beijing have done a lot of work and achieved great results. The vast majority of personnel have demonstrated firm stances, resourcefulness, courage, and the fine qualities of hard work and plain living in their work, thus winning the praise and rewards of the people in the capital. However, on the other hand, there are still many people among the public security personnel in Beijing who have bad old police work styles. Some police officers often run up debts and borrow money from the masses, eat and drink for free everywhere, and even live in housing for free, borrowing a full set of furniture; some police officers extort, blackmail, and seek petty advantages from vendors when on patrol; some police officers, because they like to take petty advantages, even have improper relations with counter-revolutionaries, failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and harboring counter-revolutionaries. These bad behaviors have created a very bad influence among the masses.

These bad old police work styles were brought from the old society by the retained police. After the liberation of Beijing, although the leaders of the Public Security Bureau conducted long-term education and transformation of the retained police and strictly dealt with some problems discovered from time to time, they did not launch a mass struggle against the old police work styles on a large scale and in a vigorous manner. Therefore, the old police work styles were not completely eliminated, and even many new police officers were eroded by this bad work style. For example, Zhou Derun, a new police officer from the Fifth Branch Bureau, was very honest in his work attitude when he first arrived at the police station, but some retained police officers scolded him as a "cart" and "greenhorn" (meaning he didn't know the ropes); when Zhou Derun became infected with the old police work style, some retained police officers said that he had "graduated." Qiu Zongnai, a retained police officer, taught the new police officer Tian Peilin how to be "cunning, lazy, slick, and bad." Some leading cadres of police stations not only turned a blind eye to these phenomena, but even themselves were eroded by the old police ideology and work style. For example, Pi Yingjie, the director of the Twelfth Police Station of the Fourth Branch Bureau, even took the lead in stealing things. A cement company put cement in front of the police station to prevent theft, and Pi Yingjie kept stealing cement in the middle of the night for a whole month.

In order to purify the ranks of the people's police, the Beijing Public Security Bureau is mobilizing the police and the broad masses to launch a fierce struggle against the old police work styles. Since the launch of the campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the public security branch bureaus have held meetings of cadres and police officers respectively, selecting two types of typical figures: those with bad work styles who refuse to confess and those who confess well. According to the policy of combining punishment and education, they announced on the spot that they would be given different treatment. All police stations also held mass meetings, at which the directors of the police stations and the police officers with bad work styles made self-criticisms in public. From January 14th, the branch bureaus further held meetings of cadres and police officers or mass meetings with the participation of mass activists to struggle against those police officers with bad qualities, serious crimes, and refusal to confess. Under the supervision and exposure of the masses and internal and external attacks, many police officers with bad work styles confessed their problems one after another, expressing their determination to correct their mistakes and start anew. Many new police officers have also raised their vigilance. Everyone is determined to eradicate the old work style and become a people's police worthy of the name. Many police officers have also incorporated methods of correcting their work styles into patriotic pacts.

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中
    北京公安局向旧警察作风展开斗争
    北京市的公安工作人员在巩固人民民主专政、保卫首都及人民生命财产的安全、维护社会革命秩序等各方面，作了很多工作，并获得了很大成绩；绝大多数人员在工作中表现了立场坚定，机智勇敢，艰苦朴素的优良品质，因而博得了首都人民的称赞和奖励。但是，另一方面，在北京市公安工作人员中间，也还有不少的人存在着恶劣的旧警察作风。有些民警常向群众赊账、借钱，到处白吃、白喝，有的甚至白住房，借用全套家具；有一些民警在出巡时，向摊贩敲诈、勒索、讨小便宜；有些民警因为爱占小便宜，甚至和反革命分子拉拉扯扯，敌我不分，包庇反革命分子。这些恶劣行为在群众中造成了极坏的影响。
    这种恶劣的旧警察作风，是留用的警察从旧社会带来的。北京解放后，公安局领导方面虽然对留用警察进行过长期的教育改造，并对随时发现的一些问题进行了严格处理，但因没有大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地展开反对旧警察作风的群众斗争，所以旧警察作风并没有彻底消灭，甚至使许多新警察也受到这种恶劣作风的侵蚀。如内五分局新警察周德润刚到派出所时，工作态度很老实，但是有些留用警察却骂他是“车子”、“雏儿”（意思是不懂事）；当周德润染上旧警察作风后，有些留用警察就说他
    “毕业了”。留用警察秋宗乃教新警察田佩林怎样要“奸、懒、油、滑、坏”的花样。有些派出所的领导干部不但对这些现象熟视无睹，甚至自己也受到了旧警察思想作风的侵蚀。如内四分局第十二派出所的所长皮英杰，竟带头偷东西。某洋灰公司为防止窃盗，把洋灰放在派出所门口，皮英杰就不断在半夜里偷洋灰，连续偷了一个月之久。
    为了纯洁人民警察的队伍，北京市公安局正发动民警和广大群众向旧警察作风展开猛烈的斗争。从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开以来，各公安分局都分别召开了干部和民警大会，选择作风恶劣而拒不坦白和坦白较好的两种典型人物，按照惩办和教育相结合的方针，当场宣布分别予以不同处理。各派出所还普遍召开过群众会，在群众会上，由派出所所长和作风恶劣的民警当众进行检讨。从一月十四日起，各分局并进一步分别召开了有群众积极分子参加的干部、民警大会或群众大会，对那些品质恶劣、罪行严重、拒不坦白的民警，展开斗争。在群众的监督、检举和内外夹攻下，很多有恶劣作风的民警，纷纷交代问题，表示要痛改前非，从新作人，许多新警察也都提高了警惕。大家纷纷下定决心，一定要根除旧作风，作一个名符其实的人民警察。还有很多民警把改正作风的办法订进了爱国公约。
