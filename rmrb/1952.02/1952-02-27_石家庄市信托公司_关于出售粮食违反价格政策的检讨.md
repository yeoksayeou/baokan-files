    Shijiazhuang Trust Company
    Self-Criticism Regarding Violation of Price Policy in Grain Sales

    To the Editor: The letter "Hengshui and Shijiazhuang Trust Companies Should Conduct Self-Criticism for Violating Price Policy," published in the "Reader's Letters" column on January 3rd, pointed out that the Shijiazhuang Trust Company also sold wheat on December 4th at a price 7.4 percent higher than the listed price, affecting the local grain company's control over grain prices. After investigation, the course of events is as follows: The Shijiazhuang City entrusted us with managing a batch of wheat collected during the summer grain collection of 1951. Later, the Municipal Finance Bureau planned to convert it into funds for use and entrusted our company to sell it on their behalf, stating that it must be sold for 1,160 yuan per jin, otherwise it would not be sold. According to their request, we explained the situation to Zhang Fengming and Zhang Jincai of the First Office of the Municipal Grain Exchange and asked the exchange to consult with the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Grain Company. Later, the Industry and Commerce Bureau told Zhang Jincai that "The Industry and Commerce Bureau has no objections and can talk with the Grain Company." However, Zhang Jincai did not contact the Grain Company and proceeded with the transaction without authorization, resulting in this error.

    The main reason for this error is that our company has a simple profit-seeking viewpoint and failed to strictly implement policies. Therefore, when the Municipal Finance Bureau proposed to sell it for more money, we did not grasp the policy principles and explain it to them, but instead pushed the transaction to the Grain Exchange. This also shows that we have an irresponsible attitude in our work. This is very wrong.

    Editor's Note: Hengshui Trust Company has not yet conducted a self-criticism, which is wrong. Please Hebei Provincial Trust Company be responsible for inspection and handling.

### 石家庄市信托公司  关于出售粮食违反价格政策的检讨

    石家庄市信托公司
    关于出售粮食违反价格政策的检讨
    编辑同志：一月三日“读者来信”栏所载“衡水、石家庄两地信托公司违犯价格政策应作检讨”一信，指出石家庄信托公司十二月四日也发生了高出牌价百分之七点四出售小麦的事情，影响了当地粮食公司对粮价的掌握。经过调查，事情的经过是这样的：石家庄市曾托我们代管一批一九五一年夏征的小麦，后来市财政局拟变款使用，又委托我公司代为出售，并声明每斤要卖一千一百六十元，否则不卖。我们根据他们的要求，就把这情况向市粮食交易所第一所张凤鸣、张进才两同志说明，并请交易所向工商局、粮食公司请示。后来工商局告诉张进才说：“工商局没甚意见，可和粮食公司谈”。但张进才并没有和粮食公司取得联系，就擅自成交，以致造成这一错误。
    造成这一错误的原因，主要是我公司存在着单纯的盈利观点，没有严格地执行政策，因此当市财政局提出要多卖钱的时候，我们没有掌握政策原则，去向他们解释，反而把成交的事推到粮食交易所去，这也表明我们在工作中有不负责任的态度。这是很不对的。

    编者按：衡水信托公司至今尚未检讨，这是错误的。请河北省信托公司负责检查处理。
