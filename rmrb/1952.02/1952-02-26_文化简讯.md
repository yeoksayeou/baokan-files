Cultural Briefs

    ▲Since the anti-corruption movement, the Tianjin People's Art Theatre has successively written and performed one-act plays such as "I Confess," "This Road is Impassable," "Turning Over a New Leaf," and "Go Report Immediately," as well as clapper talks, single-stringed instruments, cross-talk, drum storytelling, and songs. Since January 13th, the People's Art Theatre has been divided into four propaganda teams, which have performed publicly in factories, schools, government offices, streets, and at the anti-corruption movement exhibition venues. As of February 20th, preliminary statistics show that they have performed 194 shows, with a total audience of over 113,250 people.
    ▲The fourth issue of "Current Affairs Handbook" has been published. This issue contains two sets of propaganda worker speech materials, one calling on women throughout the country to participate in the anti-corruption movement and the anti-bribery movement, and the other calling on shop assistants to fire more fiercely at unscrupulous merchants. There are two sets of materials, one exposing the facts of illegal capitalists harming the Volunteers, and the other exposing the crimes of bourgeois economic spies, both with illustrations. In addition, there are eight comic strips and a song about the anti-corruption movement.
    This issue also has two "Current Affairs Q&A" sections: (1) on the current Korean armistice negotiations; (2) on the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
