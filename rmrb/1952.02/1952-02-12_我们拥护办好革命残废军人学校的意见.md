    We Support the Idea of Running Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Schools Well

    To the Editor: After reading Minister Xie Juezai's article "Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Schools Must Be Run Well" in the 51st issue of the People's Daily "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue," we felt extremely excited.

    The vast majority of the students in our school are young adults under the age of thirty who have been cultivated by the Party for a long time and tempered by the fires of war. A considerable number of the students have rendered meritorious service to the motherland and won the glorious title of "Combat Hero," the most outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland. These comrades are now showing amazing results on the learning front as well. Generally speaking, the students' scores in all subjects are mostly above 75 points in the year-end tests.

    At a time when cadres are greatly needed for national defense, economic construction, and political power construction, Minister Xie Juezai put forward the idea that "Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Schools Must Be Run Well." This idea immediately aroused the gratitude and attention of the students in our school. Everyone is eagerly hoping for a regular educational system for revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools and courses suitable for the study of revolutionary disabled soldiers to emerge in the shortest possible time, so that these revolutionary disabled soldiers with a high degree of patriotism can quickly become a group of more useful talents for national construction under the cultivation of the People's Government.

    我们拥护办好革命残废军人学校的意见
    编辑同志：当我们读了人民日报第五十一期“抗美援朝专刊”上所载的谢觉哉部长所写的“要办好革命残废军人学校”一文后，感到无限兴奋。
    我们学校的学员，绝大多数是在党的长期培养下经过炮火锻炼的三十岁以下的青壮年，其中相当多的学员，是为祖国立过功，荣获“战斗英雄”光荣称号的祖国最优秀的儿女。这些同志现在在学习战线上同样表现了惊人的成绩。一般的同志，在年终测验时，各科成绩大都在七十五分以上。
    在国防建设、经济建设和政权建设上十分需要干部的时候，谢觉哉部长提出了“要办好革命残废军人学校”的意见。这个意见，立即引起了我校学员们的感激和重视。大家都十分关怀地盼望着，在最短时期内，出现一套正规的革命残废军人学校的教育制度，和适合于革命残废军人学习的课程，使这些具有高度爱国主义精神的革命残废军人，在人民政府的培养下，迅速成为一批对国家建设更有用的人才。
