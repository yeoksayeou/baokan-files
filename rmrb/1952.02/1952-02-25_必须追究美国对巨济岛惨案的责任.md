The American aggressors' crimes of germ warfare on the Korean front and behind the lines are not yet over; the massacre of our captured personnel by American aggressors on Koje Island has occurred again. This is another serious provocation and destruction by the bloodthirsty American aggressors against the civilization, justice, and security of all mankind. It proves that the mad bestiality of the American murderers has reached an extreme level of cruelty. The prisoner-of-war camps set up by American aggressors on Koje Island in southern Korea, like the prisoner-of-war camps they set up in Suwon and other places, are more dark and terrifying hells on earth than the Buchenwald and Auschwitz concentration camps of the German fascists in World War II, as is already well known to the people of the world. There, the atrocities committed by American murderers in slaughtering and abusing captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are too numerous to record. Burning with gasoline, shooting eyes with electricity, branding with fire, shooting to death, beating to death, steaming to death, and even conducting experiments with bacteriological weapons, causing epidemics and mass deaths, the ghastly scene of that bloody slaughterhouse cannot be concealed even in the reports of the most reactionary American newspapers, magazines, and their reporters. But the American murderers are not satisfied with all these brutal atrocities; they have now created a bloody major case of murdering our captured personnel on a large scale, using collective slaughter to prove that they are the deadly enemies of the civilization, peace, and justice of all mankind.

At six o'clock at dawn on February 18, an American army accustomed to murder surrounded more than 5,000 of our captured personnel in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 62 on Koje Island, and American personnel conducted so-called "individual interrogations" of our captured personnel, forcibly implementing "screening." Our captured personnel refused this illegal "interrogation" and "screening," and the American army carried out a collective slaughter of them. According to the Associated Press, 75 of our captured personnel died tragically, and 139 were injured. In the desperate hand-to-hand resistance of our captured personnel, one American soldier died and more than 20 were injured. The American side hesitated to publish this news, but they could not conceal their own crimes. When they had to publish the news on the 22nd, they shamelessly slandered our captured personnel for "riots" and falsely claimed that the prisoners of war detained in the camp were all "North Korean civilians." However, the American murderers cannot obliterate the truth. An Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd revealed: "U.S. troops surrounded the detention camp before dawn on Monday," and then "United Nations personnel conducted individual interrogations," but "at this time, a conflict occurred in the prisoner-of-war camp," and "censorship does not allow writing the serial numbers of the American soldiers involved in the incident. It is said that about a battalion was involved. The army said that they were all from units with outstanding achievements in the Korean War." This report can only further reveal the crime of the American murderers in planning to murder our captured personnel. All the lies of the American aggressors at the Korean negotiations table about "preferential treatment" of our captured personnel have now been thoroughly exposed. Their inhuman collective slaughter of our unarmed captured personnel, groaning in a ghastly hell, cannot be concealed by any amount of lies.

This large-scale murder case again proves that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposal put forward by the U.S. side on the fourth item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda is an extremely absurd and vicious conspiracy. The American aggressors have consistently adopted vicious means that violate international law, such as abuse, killing, forced fascist education, forced imprinting of reactionary slogans on the body, and forced participation in the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," in an attempt to achieve the despicable goal of detaining a large number of our captured personnel and transferring them to the remnant Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee bandits in South Korea. All these vicious means have been constantly exposed, so the American aggressors have now adopted large-scale slaughter to continue to attempt to achieve their despicable goals. A Reuters dispatch on the 22nd revealed: "The riot occurred during the second screening to determine which prisoners had 'pro-democratic' views," and "the 200 judges, lawyers, and police of the screening committee are still continuing their work in other prisoner-of-war camps," because "the South Korean government wants the United Nations Command to release 'pro-democratic' civilians to supplement South Korea's manpower." This thoroughly exposes the U.S. side's "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy. The U.S. side once falsely claimed that the principle of "voluntary repatriation" for captured personnel was to "respect individual will," but in fact, under the bloody hands of the American aggressors, our captured personnel not only cannot express any "individual will" at all, but now the American aggressors are using large-scale slaughter to eliminate the "individual will" of the captured personnel.

At the staff meeting on the fourth item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda on the 23rd, it was entirely correct for our staff personnel to lodge a serious protest against the Koje Island massacre created by the U.S. side. We firmly support our side's just demands. Our side has never recognized the U.S. side's reclassification of our captured military personnel as "civilians"; moreover, the responsibility that the American aggressors should bear for all the crimes in the Koje Island massacre cannot be reduced in the slightest by falsely claiming that the victims were "civilians." Our side has all the legitimate rights to hold the American aggressors accountable for all their inhuman crimes; and to demand that the U.S. side hand over, without reservation, all the detailed materials of our captured personnel who were massacred this time in Koje Island and in previous instances; and to hand over, without reservation, all the detailed materials of all our captured personnel.

We, the Chinese people and the people of the world, must launch a just condemnation against the escalating and ever-increasing monstrous crimes of the American aggressors who threaten and destroy all mankind. We can never coexist with the American murderers who conduct germ warfare and large-scale slaughter of prisoners. The Geneva Conventions of 1929 and 1949 concerning prisoners of war, which the U.S. government participated in signing, clearly stipulate that all prisoners of war should be released unconditionally, that prisoners should be treated humanely, that prisoners should be protected from abuse and insult, and that all means of retaliation should be prohibited for prisoners. However, the American aggressors not only insisted on absurd demands on the prisoner issue in the Korean armistice negotiations, completely violating international law and international agreements based on the principles of international law; but their current monstrous crimes of completely undermining international law and international agreements are increasing, which cannot but fill all conscientious people in the world with righteous indignation. The U.S. government also participated in the Nuremberg International Tribunal's trial of German fascist war criminals after World War II. Then, they should remember how deeply the anti-fascist people of the world hated and vowed not to coexist with the masterminds who committed war crimes, crimes against peace, conspiracy crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, today's American aggressors, regardless of everything, have adopted the bloody means that fascist war criminals once adopted, and have created many brutal crimes one after another. If we do not resolutely stop them and resolutely hold them accountable, then the civilization, justice, and security of all mankind will be completely destroyed. Therefore, we want to once again call on the people of the world to rise up, resolutely hold the U.S. accountable for the Koje Island massacre, resolutely oppose all the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors, resolutely fight against the American aggressors, and never stop until the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world is achieved.

### 必须追究美国对巨济岛惨案的责任

    必须追究美国对巨济岛惨案的责任
    在朝鲜前线和后方，美国侵略者进行细菌战争的罪行未已；在巨济岛上美国侵略者对我方被俘人员的屠杀惨案又起。这是嗜血成性的美国侵略者，向全人类的文明、正义和安全，又一个严重的挑衅和破坏。这证明美国杀人犯们的疯狂兽性已经达到极端残酷的程度了。美国侵略者在朝鲜南方的巨济岛上所设的俘虏营，和他们在水原等地所设的俘虏营一样，是比第二次世界大战中德国法西斯的布痕瓦尔德、奥斯威辛等集中营更为黑暗、更为恐怖的人间地狱，这早已为世界人民所共知的了。在那里，美国杀人犯们残杀和虐待朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的暴行是罄竹难书的。汽油烧身，电光射眼，火烙，枪杀，打死，蒸死，以至作细菌武器的试验，造成疾疫蔓延、大批死亡，那一片血淋淋的屠场的阴森惨象，就连美国最反动的报纸、杂志和它们的记者在报道中也都无法掩饰。但是美国杀人犯们还不满足于这一切残暴的兽行，他们现在更制造了一个大规模谋杀我方被俘人员的血腥巨案，他们用集体的屠杀来证明他们是全人类的文明与和平、正义的死敌。
    二月十八日拂晓六时，一支惯于谋杀的美国军队，在巨济岛上美国第六十二号俘虏营中，把我方被俘人员五千余人包围起来，由美方人员对我方被俘人员进行所谓“个别讯问”，强迫实行“甄别”。我方被俘人员拒绝这种非法的“讯问”和“甄别”，美军就对他们实行了集体的屠杀。据美联社透露，我方被俘人员惨死者七十五人，受伤者一百三十九人。在我方被俘人员拚命肉搏反抗中，美军死一名，伤二十余名。美方迟迟不敢发表这个消息，但又无法掩盖他们自己的罪行，直到二十二日他们不能不发表这个消息的时候，却无耻地诬赖我方被俘人员“暴动”，并诡称该俘虏营所拘留的都是“北朝鲜平民”。然而，美国杀人犯们是不能抹杀事实真相的。美联社二十二日的电讯中已经透露：“美军部队在星期一拂晓前包围了这个拘留营”，然后“联合国人员进行了个别讯问”，但“这时俘虏营就发生了冲突”，而“新闻检查不许写出牵涉在这事件内的美国兵的番号，据说牵涉在内的大约有一营。陆军方面说，他们都是在朝鲜战争中有显著战绩的部队中的人。”这个报道，只能使美国杀人犯有计划地谋杀我方被俘人员的罪行欲盖弥彰。美国侵略者在朝鲜谈判的会议桌上所说的“优待”我方被俘人员的一切谎言，现在更彻底地被揭穿了。他们惨无人道地集体屠杀手无寸铁的、在阴惨的地狱中呻吟的我方被俘人员的罪行，决不是撒下漫天大谎的鬼话所能够遮掩得了的。
    这个大规模的谋杀案，又证明了美方在朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程上的所谓“自愿遣返”的提案，是极端荒谬的和毒辣的阴谋。美国侵略者一贯采用了虐待、残杀、强迫进行法西斯教育、强迫在身上刺反动口号、强迫参加所谓“反共救国团”等违犯国际公法的恶毒手段，企图达到大批扣留我方被俘人员，转送台湾国民党残余匪帮和南朝鲜李承晚匪帮的卑鄙目的。这一切恶毒的手段已经不断地被揭穿了，于是美国侵略者现在就采用了大规模的屠杀，来继续企图达到他们的卑鄙目的。路透社二十二日电讯透露：“暴动发生时正进行第二次甄别以决定那些俘虏有‘倾向民主’的见解”，“甄别委员会的两百个法官、律师与警察仍在其他俘虏营中继续工作”，因为“南朝鲜政府要联合国军司令部释放‘倾向民主’的平民以补充南朝鲜的人力”。这就彻底地揭穿了美方“自愿遣返”的阴谋。美方曾诡称对于被俘人员实行“自愿遣返”的原则是为了“尊重个人的意志”，然而，事实上在美国侵略者的血手之下，我方被俘人员不但根本不能表达任何“个人的意志”，而且现在美国侵略者更以大规模的屠杀来消灭被俘人员的“个人意志”了。
    在朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程二十三日的参谋会议上，我们参谋人员就美方所制造的巨济岛惨案，提出严重抗议是完全正确的。我们坚决支持我方的正义主张。我方从不承认美方将我方被俘的军事人员重新分类为“平民”；而且美国侵略者对于巨济岛惨案中全部罪行所应负的责任，也决不能因诡称被害者为“平民”而有丝毫减轻。我方有一切合法的权利，对于美国侵略者的一切灭绝人性的罪行，追究责任；并且要美方把这一次在巨济岛被屠杀的及历次被杀害的我方被俘人员的充分材料，毫无保留地交出来；把我方全部被俘人员的充分材料，毫无保留地交出来。
    我们中国人民和全世界人民，对于美国侵略者威胁和毁灭全人类的、变本加厉的、日甚一日的滔天罪行，一定要展开正义的声讨。我们对于进行细菌战和大规模屠杀俘虏的美国杀人犯是决不能两立的。美国政府参加签字的一九二九年和一九四九年关于战俘的日内瓦公约，早已明白规定战俘应一律被释放、应以人道待遇俘虏、保护俘虏不受虐待和侮辱、一切报复手段禁用于俘虏。但是，美国侵略者却不仅在朝鲜停战谈判中对俘虏问题坚持荒谬主张，完全违犯了国际法及以国际法的原则为基础的国际协定；而且他们目前彻底破坏国际法和国际协定的滔天罪行正有加无已，这是使全世界一切有良心的人民不能不义愤填膺的。美国政府也曾参加过第二次世界大战后纽伦堡国际法庭对德国法西斯战犯的审判，那末，他们就应该记得，反法西斯的世界人民对于犯了战争罪、反对和平罪、阴谋罪和反对人道罪的罪魁祸首，是怎样深恶痛绝，誓不与共戴天的了。然而，今天的美国侵略者却不顾一切地采用了法西斯战犯们所曾经采用的血腥手段，接二连三地制造了许多残暴的罪行，我们如果不坚决加以制止，不坚决追究他们的责任，那末，全人类的文明、正义和安全就将完全被破坏了。因此，我们要再一次地号召全世界人民起来，坚决追究美国对巨济岛惨案的责任，坚决反对美国侵略者的一切滔天罪行，坚决和美国侵略者作斗争，不达到和平解决朝鲜问题、保卫远东与世界和平的目的，决不休止。
