    Fengfeng Mining Bureau Deputy Director Lu Zezhong and Others
    Fail to Implement Wage Reform According to National Regulations

    To the Editor: Lu Zezhong, Deputy Director of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, and Yang Pei, Deputy Section Chief of the Wage Section, are not acting according to national regulations in carrying out wage reform. Last September, Fengfeng Coal Mine began calculating wages. According to national regulations, the current wage should include "disguised wages" such as entry-pit fees and other wage-related expenses. Lu Zezhong and Yang Pei actually submitted the average wage score without calculating "disguised wages" to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council for approval, in violation of the regulations. Li Jinbang, the Wage Minister of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Labor Bureau of the Fengfeng Mining District People's Government, after learning of this situation, suggested to them: "Disguised wages" should be included in the current wage. However, they used the fact that this was a wage score approved by the central government, and requested further instructions from the Hebei Provincial Financial and Economic Committee as shields. After the Hebei Provincial Financial and Economic Committee approved that it should be implemented in accordance with the regulations, they neither submitted a supplementary budget to the Central Financial and Economic Committee, nor implemented it in accordance with the regulations, but used conversion methods to deduct wages from workers. For example, the state stipulates that "the average score for July, August, and September should be used as the basic score, and should be calculated uniformly according to the Hebei provincial score." But they did not do so. Later, although the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and others raised opinions again, they remained passive and deliberately delayed. The workers are all dissatisfied with this matter. I suggest that the higher authorities immediately inspect the wage reform work of this mine and deal with the relevant lawbreakers. Hong Guanglie

### 峰峰矿务局副局长陆泽中等  不按国家规定进行工资改革

    峰峰矿务局副局长陆泽中等
    不按国家规定进行工资改革
    编辑同志：峰峰矿务局副局长陆泽中、工薪科副科长杨培五在进行工资改革时不按照国家规定办事。去年九月，峰峰煤矿开始测算工资工作。按国家规定，现行工资应把入坑费及其他工资性质开支的“变相工资”加入在内。陆泽中和杨培五竟不按规定，把没有计算“变相工资”的平均工资分数呈报中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准。河北省总工会工资部长李金榜和峰峰矿区人民政府劳动局知道这个情况后，向他们建议：“变相工资”应计算在现行工资里。他们却用这是中央批准的工资分数，以及向河北省财政经济委员会另行请示来做挡箭牌。等到河北省财政经济委员会批示应按规定执行后，他们既不向中央财政经济委员会补交预算，也不按规定执行，而用换算方法来克扣工人。如国家规定“七、八、九三个月的平均分值作为基本分值，并一律按河北省地分值计算。”但他们不这样做。以后虽经省总工会等再提意见，他们仍消极抵抗，故意拖拉。对这件事，工人们都感到不满意。我建议上级立刻检查这个矿的工资改革工作，并处理有关的违法人员。  洪光烈
