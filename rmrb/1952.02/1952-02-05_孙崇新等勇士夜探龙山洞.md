    Deputy Battalion Commander Sun Chongxin of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, leading twenty-six warriors, climbed over a dozen high mountains, slipping and sliding every step, and broke through several enemy blockades to reach the road intersection one li away from Dragon Mountain Cave. It was already one o'clock in the morning. Sun Chongxin ordered the team to lie in ambush on both sides of the road, waiting for the enemy. After waiting for more than an hour, the enemy still did not appear. Sun Chongxin thought, "This reconnaissance mission is very important to the war, no matter how difficult it is, it must be completed." So, he resolutely decided to go deep into the enemy's heartland.

    When they arrived at Dragon Mountain Cave, dawn was breaking. They learned from a Korean old man that they were surrounded by enemies, and there were four enemy sentries on a hill about 100 meters away from them. Sun Chongxin quickly ordered the team to be divided into two squads and sent platoon leader Zhao Fuqian and eight others to "take out the sentries" on the hill. Each of the eight warriors was full of energy, crawling forward gently. As they approached the hilltop, soldier Li Yuting saw an enemy sentry in front of him fiddling with a gun under a tree. He nimbly and lightly went around behind the tree and struck the enemy sentry hard on the head with the butt of his submachine gun. Squad leader Ju Dianqing followed closely and pounced on him, hugging the enemy around the waist, quickly seized his carbine, and gagged his mouth. At the same time, soldier Zheng Renchuan and others also climbed near the enemy's tent. At this moment, a fat American devil carrying a carbine was walking towards them head-on. Zheng Renchuan, taking him by surprise, jumped up and grabbed the devil's neck, and the two rolled into a ball on the ground. When platoon leader Zhao Fuqian saw this, he pounced on him like an arrow and rode on the devil's neck to capture him. After soldier Yu Deshui and the others climbed to the top of the hill, he vigilantly searched every room. He suddenly saw a pair of American leather boots sticking out from outside a straw shed. He grabbed the leather boots and dragged them out, dragging them for more than ten meters. Soldier Yang Shaokuan pounced on him, and the two of them pressed the sleeping devil tightly to the ground. They victoriously captured two American devils and one Syngman Rhee bandit soldier, and they completed the reconnaissance mission assigned by their superiors.

    孙崇新等勇士夜探龙山洞
    志愿军某部副营长孙崇新，带领二十六个勇士一步一滑地爬过十几座高山，冲过好几道敌人的封锁线，到达了距龙山洞一里地的公路交叉点。这时，已是深夜一点钟了。孙崇新命令队伍伏在公路两旁，等候敌人。直等了一个多钟头，还不见敌人过来。孙崇新想：“这个侦察任务对战争的关系很大，不管怎样艰难，一定要完成。”于是，他毅然决定深入到敌人的心脏地区去。
    到达龙山洞，天将发亮。他们从一个朝鲜老百姓的口里知道，他们的周围都是敌人，离他们约百公尺的一个山头上有四个敌哨兵。孙崇新迅速地命令队伍分成两个班，并派排长赵福钱等八人去山头“摸哨”。八个勇士个个精神饱满，轻轻向前爬行。将到山头时，战士李玉庭看到前面有一个敌哨兵正在树下摆弄着枪。他敏捷而轻巧地绕到树后，用冲锋枪柄，对中敌哨兵的头部猛的一击，班长居殿卿紧跟着就猛扑上去，拦腰抱住敌人，迅速地夺下卡宾枪，又堵住了他的嘴。在同一时间，战士郑仁川等也爬到了敌人帐篷附近。这时，正有一个挟着卡宾枪的肥大的美国鬼子向他们迎头走来，郑仁川乘其不备，跳上去一把捏住了鬼子的脖子，两人就地扭成了一团。排长赵福钱看见后，就像箭一般地猛扑上去，顺势骑在鬼子的脖子上把他捉住了。战士于德水和大伙一起爬上山头后，他就机警地搜索着每个房间。他忽然看到一双美国大皮靴露在草棚子外面，他挟起大皮靴就往外拖，一拖就拖出了十多公尺。战士杨少宽一个猛扑，两个人把这个睡觉的鬼子紧紧地按倒在地。他们胜利地抓到两个美国鬼子和一个李承晚匪军，他们完成了上级交给的侦察任务。
