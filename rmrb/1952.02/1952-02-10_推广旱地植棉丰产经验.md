    Promoting High-Yield Experience in Dryland Cotton Planting
    At present, only about ten percent of the cotton fields in China can be irrigated. The main cotton-producing area in the country—the Yellow River Basin cotton area—is plagued by drought nine years out of ten. Therefore, how to increase the yield of dryland cotton is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. In Tiantaishan and twenty-six other villages in Feixiang County, Hebei Province, six hundred thousand mu of dryland cotton produced an average of 180 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than double the average yield of general dryland cotton. Their experience is worth promoting.
    The primary condition for high-yield dryland cotton is timely sowing. The experience of Tiantaishan and twenty-six other villages proves that this can be done. There is a significant difference in yield depending on whether cotton is sown in time. Cotton sown around the time of Lesser Fullness [around May 21st] yields one-third to one-half less than cotton sown around Grain Rain [around April 20th]. In 1951, when cotton was sown, there was a drought, and many areas delayed the sowing period because they were waiting for rain or simply emphasized carrying water for spot planting (because carrying water for spot planting is labor-intensive and slow), which had a great impact on cotton production. The experience of Tiantaishan and twenty-six other villages proves that as long as autumn plowing and deep plowing, as well as early spring fine harrowing, are done well to maintain soil moisture, cotton can be sown on time by adopting methods of seizing moisture and borrowing moisture even in the absence of rain. This refutes the notion held by many that dryland cotton cannot be sown on time if it does not rain.
    To achieve high yields of dryland cotton, it is also necessary to promote close planting and increase fertilizer application. Tiantaishan and twenty-six other villages maintained the habit of close planting of cotton, which is one of the main reasons for obtaining high yields. This is entirely consistent with Qu Yaoli's experience in high-yield cotton planting in irrigated land. As for increasing fertilizer application, the experience of Tiantaishan and twenty-six other villages proves that dryland cotton can not only be applied with base fertilizer but also with top dressing. This is because drought is generally the main problem in arid areas in the spring, and after July and August, there is generally no shortage of rain, with sufficient moisture to decompose the fertilizer and supply it for cotton plants to absorb. This refutes the notion held by some that arid land lacks water and cannot be fertilized heavily. These experiences are all worthy of study and learning by various localities.

    推广旱地植棉丰产经验
    我国目前能够灌溉的棉田仅占全部棉田面积的百分之十左右。全国的主要棉区——黄河流域棉区，更是十年九旱。因此，如何提高旱地棉花产量，是一个急待解决的问题。河北省肥乡县天台山等二十六村，六万亩旱地棉花，每亩平均产籽棉一百八十斤，超过一般旱地棉花平均产量的一倍。他们的经验是值得推广的。
    旱地棉花丰产的首要条件就是及时播种。天台山等二十六村的经验证明，这是能够作得到的。棉花播种是否及时，产量相差很多。小满前后播种的棉花比谷雨前后播种的棉花产量要低三分之一到二分之一。一九五一年棉花播种时，天旱不雨，许多地区因为等雨或单纯强调担水点种（因担水点种费劳力多，种得慢），因而延迟了播种期，对棉花的产量影响很大。天台山等二十六村的经验证明，只要作好秋耕深耕及早春细耙，把墒土保持好，在不下雨的情况下，采用抢墒、借墒的办法，也能按时播种。这就打破了许多人认为天不下雨，旱地棉花就不能按时播种的说法。
    要使旱地棉花获得高额产量，还必须推行棉花密植和增施肥料。天台山等二十六村保持了棉花密植的习惯，是获得丰产的主要原因之一，这是和曲耀离的水浇地棉花丰产经验完全一致的。至于增施肥料，天台山等二十六村的经验证明，旱地棉花不仅能施基肥，而且也能施追肥，这是因为一般干旱地区主要都是春旱，到七、八月后，一般都不缺雨，有足够的水分分解肥料，供给棉株吸收。这就打破了某些人认为旱地缺水不能多施肥的说法。这些经验都值得各地研究学习。
