Telephone operator Ding Shufen is a female telephone operator on the railway front of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Under the frequent bombing and strafing by enemy planes, she always stuck to her post and ensured the smooth flow of telephone communications. Once, one of the entrances to her telephone station (located in an air-raid shelter near a train station) was collapsed by a bomb from an enemy plane. Dense smoke filled the entire shelter, and the lights were also extinguished by the shock. At that time, she felt dizzy, and her ears were buzzing; however, she immediately cheered up and quickly connected the wires in the dark, reporting the damage to the station to her superiors, thereby ensuring the timely repair of the railway and the passage of trains. Under the frenzied bombing of enemy planes, it was often not easy to repair the broken wires immediately. She knew that the more rampant the enemy's bombing, the more important the telephone communication became. Relying on her own intelligence, she came up with a method to ensure telephone communication—the "message relay" method, which meant completely recording what one party wanted to say and transmitting it to the other party segment by segment. Once, a train loaded with military supplies was about to depart when the telephone line was suddenly blown up by enemy planes. Without telephone communication, the train could not depart on time. She thought: "I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I must not let the loss of telephone contact affect the combat missions at the front." At this time, she came up with a way to relay the telephone message station by station. In less than three minutes, the train successfully departed.

Ding Shufen not only resolutely completed her tasks, but also loved the country's materials. Once, a train loaded with clothing from the motherland was hit by enemy planes, and she rushed onto the train cars to rescue the goods without hesitation. At this time, the train cars were already very hot from the fire, and the rubber soles of her shoes were crackling from the heat. Her face was scorched by the fire, and she felt a lot of pain; her hands were also blistered, but she still took the water brought by her comrades and poured it bucket by bucket at the flames until they were extinguished.

Comrade Ding Shufen often said: "The telephone is my weapon in combat, and I must never bow to danger and difficulty and lay down my weapon." Because she overcame layers of difficulties and stubbornly completed the tasks assigned to her by the people of the motherland, her superiors awarded her a major merit. She also won the glorious title of "Model Communist Youth League Member." (Attached picture)

    艰苦坚持工作的电话员丁淑芬
    丁淑芬是人民志愿军铁道战线上的女电话员。在敌机频繁的轰炸和扫射下，她始终坚持着自己的工作岗位，保证了电话的畅通。有一次，她的电话所（在靠近某火车站的一个防空洞里）的一个洞口被敌机的炸弹震塌了，浓烟弥漫了整个洞内，灯也被震灭了。当时她感觉到头晕，耳朵里也直嗡嗡发响；但是她马上又振作起来，在黑暗中很快地接好电线，向上级汇报了车站被敌机毁坏的情况，因而保障了铁路及时抢修和列车通行。在敌机的疯狂轰炸下，电线被炸断后，往往不易立即修好。她知道：敌机的轰炸愈猖狂，电话的联络就愈重要。她凭着自己的智慧，想出了保证电话联络的办法——“传达电话”法，就是把一方要说的话完全记下来，一句一句地按段传到对方。有一次，满载着军需物品的一列火车就要出发，电话线突然被敌机炸断了。电话联络不上，火车也不能按时驶行。她想：“我是个青年团员，决不能因为电话失掉联系而影响前线的战斗任务。”这时，她想出了一个办法，将电话一站一站地向前传达，不到三分钟，这列火车便胜利地开走了。
    丁淑芬不但坚决完成了自己的任务，同时也热爱着祖国的物资。一次，一列满载着祖国衣物的火车被敌机打着了，她毫不犹豫地扑上车皮去抢救。这时车皮已经被火烤得很热，胶鞋底子烧得吱吱直叫；她的脸被火薰着，她感到很疼，手上也烙成了泡，但她仍然接着同志们提来的水，一桶桶地对准火焰泼去，直到熄灭。
    丁淑芬同志常说：“电话机就是我作战的武器，我决不能向危险和困难低头而放下自己的武器。”由于她战胜了层层的困难，顽强地完成了祖国人民所交给她的任务，上级给她立了一大功。她并且获得了“模范青年团员”的光荣称号。（附图片）
