    The Profiteers Who Sabotaged the Huai River Project Must Be Punished
    In the anti-corruption, anti-theft struggle in Nanjing, some shocking events have been exposed. Nine timber merchants in Nanjing, namely Yida, Jingcheng, Taicheng, Tailai, Xiangji, Yongcheng, Ju?, Huachang, and Yufeng, colluded with cadres of the Huai River Project Bureau to seek exorbitant profits. In two transactions involving the sale of six thousand pilings and ten thousand feet of foreign pine to the Huai River Project Bureau, they doubled the prices. Furthermore, they mixed old, rotten planks that were already blackened, cracked, and collapsing with good planks for delivery. They used the worst "Wuning West wood" from Jiangxi to impersonate high-quality "Guang wood." Dozens of the six thousand pilings were already broken when they were transported from Nanjing to Bengbu for unloading. Preliminary estimates indicate that the profiteers embezzled more than 300 million yuan of state assets in this transaction alone. The Nanjing Municipal People's Government has now arrested and brought to justice Dai Yunxiao, the head of Yida Timber Company, Zhao Songtao, the manager of Jingcheng Timber Company, and broker Song Shikang, all of whom are extremely guilty.
    Harnessing the Huai River is a great project for the working people of New China to fight against nature. In 1951, the first year of harnessing the Huai River, New China was only a little over a year old, and national defense and economic construction were in urgent need of attention. However, the Central People's Government still invested 500,000 tons of rice as funds for harnessing the Huai River. Millions of laborers along the Huai River enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well," working selflessly and fighting against the floods. They knew that the completion of the Huai River harnessing project would eliminate the historical disasters of the Huai River and turn the thousand-year flood into permanent water conservancy. The people on both sides of the Huai River would never again have to endure the tragic days of "major disasters in heavy rain, minor disasters in light rain, and drought in the absence of rain." The people of the whole country supported the people along the Huai River with boundless enthusiasm and manpower and material resources, demonstrating the high spirit of friendship among the people of New China. However, the profiteers, who were selfish and profit-seeking, disregarded the lives of the 70 million people on both sides of the Huai River in order to obtain shameful profits, and sold bad wood to the Huai River Project Bureau as materials for repairing the Huai River. Every conscientious Chinese person should stand up and denounce these abominable villains and wage a relentless struggle against them. The people's judicial organs should severely punish these inhuman profiteers.

    必须惩罚破坏治淮工程的奸商
    南京市在反贪污、反盗窃斗争中，揭发了一些令人切齿痛恨的事件。南京市益大、竞成、泰成、泰来、祥记、永成、钜?、华昌、裕丰等九家木行奸商，为了图谋暴利，竟勾引治淮工程局干部，在卖六千根桩木和一万呎洋松给治淮工程局的两笔生意中，把价格抬高一倍；并且把已经发黑、开裂、坍边的旧的腐烂的木板，混在好木板中交货；用江西最坏的“武宁西木”冒充质量好的“广木”。这六千根桩木由南京运到蚌埠卸货时，就已折断了几十根。据初步估计，奸商在这一笔买卖中，就盗窃了国家资财三亿元以上。现在南京市人民政府已把罪大恶极的奸商益大木行负责人戴云啸、竞成木行经理赵松涛及掮客宋世康三犯逮捕法办。
    根治淮河是新中国劳动人民对自然作斗争的一件伟大工程。在一九五一年，即根治淮河的第一年，新中国诞生还只一年多，国防建设、经济建设百端待举，但中央人民政府仍投资五十万吨大米，作为治淮经费。沿淮数百万民工热烈响应毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召，忘我地劳动，和洪水搏斗。他们知道，根治淮河工程的完成，将消灭淮河历史性的灾害，把淮河千年的水患变成永远的水利。淮河两岸人民将永不会再过“大雨大灾、小雨小灾、不雨旱灾”的悲惨日子。全国人民，则以无限热情和人力物力来支援沿淮人民，表现了新中国人民的高度友爱精神。但是，损人利己、唯利是图的奸商，为了牟取可耻的暴利，竟不顾淮河两岸七千万人民的死活，把坏木料卖给治淮工程局作为修治淮河的材料。每一个有良心的中国人，都应该起来声讨这些可恶的奸徒，对他们进行无情的斗争。人民的司法机关，应该使这些丧失了人性的奸商受到严厉的惩处。
