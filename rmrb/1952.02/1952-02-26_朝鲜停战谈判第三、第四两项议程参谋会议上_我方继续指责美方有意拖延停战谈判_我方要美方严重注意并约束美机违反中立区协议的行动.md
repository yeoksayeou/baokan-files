Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 25th: At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 25th, our side solemnly pointed out that the other side's continued insistence on opposing the reasonable solutions proposed by our side on various issues of the third agenda item can only be interpreted as intentionally delaying the armistice negotiations. On the issues of rotation and ports of entry, our side has already proposed a completely reasonable compromise plan of a rotation limit of 35,000 people per month and five specific rear ports of entry for each side. On the issue of neutral nation nominations, our side has suggested that both sides simultaneously and at once agree to all neutral nation nominations proposed by the other side, or that both sides each nominate countries that meet the definition of neutral nations to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, without any consent procedures. Our side once again requests the other side to seriously consider and accept our suggestions.

At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, our side once again pointed out that the absurd "voluntary repatriation" claim insisted upon by the other side is a stumbling block hindering the progress of the meeting. The problem can only be resolved if the other side accepts our principle of unconditionally releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war held by both sides. After the staff meeting adjourned, the translation staff of both sides conducted textual proofreading of the Korean, Chinese, and English clauses of the articles that had been agreed upon by both sides.

At 13:05 on the 24th, four US military aircraft violated the agreement by intruding into the airspace over the conference area. The other side's security officer stationed in the conference area, although witnessing this violation of the agreement, refused the request of our side's security officer to conduct a joint investigation of the incident. Our side's liaison officer pointed out to the other side's liaison officer today that the other side's military aircraft have continuously violated the agreement by intruding into the neutral zone. Although our side has repeatedly protested, the other side has consistently failed to take measures to stop it, and the fact that its security officer refused to conduct a joint investigation of this violation of the agreement proves that these incidents are by no means accidental. Our side demands that the other side pay serious attention to this, provide a clear account of the incident on the 24th, and restrain its military aircraft from repeating this blatant violation of the agreement. The other side replied that the incident is currently under investigation.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三、第四两项议程参谋会议上
    我方继续指责美方有意拖延停战谈判
    我方要美方严重注意并约束美机违反中立区协议的行动
    【新华社开城二十五日电】二十五日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方严正指出：对方在第三项议程各项问题上继续坚持反对我方所提出的合理解决方案，只能被解释为有意拖延停战谈判。在轮换和口岸的问题上，我方已经提出了每月三万五千人的轮换限额，和每方五个特定后方口岸的完全合理的折衷方案。在中立国提名问题上，我方已建议双方同时并一次同意另一方所提出的全部中立国提名，或者双方各自提名合乎中立国定义的国家，组成中立国监察委员会，而不进行任何同意手续。我方再次要求对方郑重考虑，并接受我方的建议。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方再一次指出对方所坚持的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，是阻碍会议进展的绊脚石。对方只有接受我方无条件释放并遣返双方所收容的全部战俘的原则，才能解决问题。参谋会议休会后，双方翻译人员就双方已经达成协议的各款的朝中英文条款，进行了文字校对工作。
    二十四日十三时零五分，美方军用飞机四架违反协议，侵入会场区上空。对方驻在会场区的安全军官，虽目睹这一违反协议的事件，竟拒绝我方安全军官的要求，拒绝就该事件进行共同调查。我方联络官今日向对方联络官指出：对方军用飞机不断违反协议侵入中立区，虽经我方屡次抗议，始终未见对方采取措施加以制止，而此次其安全军官竟拒绝对这种违反协议事件进行共同调查，足以证明这种事件绝非偶然性质。我方要求对方对此予以严重的注意，对二十四日事件，作一清楚的交代，并约束其军用飞机不再重复这种彰明昭著的违反协议的行动。对方答称，对此事件正在进行调查中。
