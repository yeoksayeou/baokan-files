　　In the half-year process of ideological remolding studies for teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities, we have initially recognized the widespread existence of the bourgeois ideological system. But we never expected that its infiltration, pervasiveness, and destructive nature within the entire education system would be so serious! From the incomplete figures that have been exposed so far, the phenomenon of corruption is quite serious, and the manifestations of waste and bureaucracy, especially among teachers, are astonishing, with figures far exceeding corruption! Of course, most universities are also a part of what was left over from the old society. The entire old society was rotten to the core, and universities could not be clean. In addition, the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie over the past two years, vying with the working class for leadership, made universities, as places where intellectuals are concentrated, inevitably one of the main battlefields. Therefore, we have found that some educators themselves are capitalists or merchants, lurking in schools as teachers or staff, consistently using their power and position to engage in embezzlement and self-enrichment at the expense of others. Some people have been hit by sugar-coated bullets, pulled by businessmen to be directors, consultants, or partners and spies, selling themselves and colluding to steal the property of the people or the country. In private schools, there are even more speculators, wearing the cloak of education to engage in "cost-free and highly profitable" operations. Within such an organization, a corruption group is inevitably formed, sucking the marrow of the people to fatten themselves, from top to bottom, making corruption a common practice. Various tangible and direct harms have reached a very alarming level in national higher education. As for the intangible and indirect ones, it is really difficult to estimate!

　　These various extremely ugly facts have been thoroughly exposed by the masses in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The stinky mud in the gutter has seen the sun. The corrupt elements certainly need to turn over a new leaf and start anew, and other educators also need to severely criticize the reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie, eliminate the bad habits of the past, take a good bath, and better engage in the sacred task of cultivating people's cadres! Let me here wish the new birth of Chinese education!

    我看到了学校中的丑恶的一面
    天津南开大学校务委员会主任委员  杨石先
    在京津高等学校教师思想改造学习的半年过程中，我们已初步认识到资产阶级思想体系的广泛存在。但绝未意料到，在整个教育机构内，它的渗入普遍性及侵蚀破坏性达到如此之严重！从目前已被揭发的不完全的数字来看，贪污现象相当严重，而浪费和官僚主义的表现，特别在教师中，是非常惊人的，数字远比贪污要大！当然，大多数高等学校也是旧社会遗留下来的一部分，整个旧社会腐朽业已透顶，高等学校自不能清白。再加上资产阶级两年来的猖狂进攻，要和工人阶级争取领导权，高等学校是大知识分子集中的处所，必然是主要阵地之一。所以我们发现有的教育工作者自身就是资本家，就是商人，而潜伏在学校内作教师作职员，一贯利用职权和地位，来进行假公济私和损人利己的勾当。有的人是被糖衣炮弹所击中，为商人拉过去作董事、顾问，或者当伙友和坐探，卖身投靠，共同来窃盗人民或国家的财产。在私立学校内更有大批投机分子，披着教育的外衣来作“无本万利”的经营。在那样一个组织之内，必然造成一个贪污集团，吸取人民的膏血来肥壮自己，从上到下，使贪污蔚为风气。各种有形的直接的危害在全国高等教育上已达到非常惊人的程度，至于无形的、间接的，那实在难于估计的！
    这种形形色色极端丑恶的事实，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中都被群众彻底地揭露了。阴沟里面的臭泥见到了太阳。贪污分子此后固然需要洗心革面重新为人，其他教育工作者也要严厉批判资产阶级的反动思想，肃清过去的不良作风，洗一个大澡，来更好地从事于培养人民干部的神圣任务！让我在这里预祝中国教育的新生！
