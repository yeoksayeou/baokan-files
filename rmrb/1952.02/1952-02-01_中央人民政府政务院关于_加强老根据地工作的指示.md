    (1) The Central People's Government's dispatch of visiting delegations to various old revolutionary base areas and the invitation of representatives from these areas to Beijing to participate in National Day celebrations has strengthened the ties between the Central People's Government and all levels of government with the people of the old base areas. It has commended the great revolutionary achievements of the people in these areas and heightened their enthusiasm for loving and building the motherland. This has been a great gain.

    The people of the old revolutionary base areas have waged long and arduous struggles against imperialism, the Kuomintang bandit gangs, and feudal landlords, making the greatest contributions, sacrifices, and suffering the most devastation. After liberation, through active production, some areas have recovered, with some even exceeding pre-war levels. However, most old base areas have experienced slow recovery due to severe war damage and being located in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. Some areas have also been affected by floods and droughts. Particularly in the southern old base areas, which were liberated later, vast areas remain uncultivated, and the people's lives are extremely difficult. Therefore, it is essential, both politically and economically, to attach great importance to strengthening work in the old revolutionary base areas, vigorously leading and supporting the people in restoring and developing economic and cultural construction.

    (2) Strengthening economic construction in the old revolutionary base areas is the central link in strengthening work in these areas. As these areas are mostly mountainous with difficult production conditions, we should adhere to the principle of combining addressing the people's immediate needs with long-term construction. Adapt to local conditions, plan carefully, and focus on gradually restoring and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. In general, agriculture should be the focus, while mountainous areas unsuitable for cultivation should prioritize forestry and animal husbandry. However, all areas must simultaneously pay close attention to utilizing local conditions to develop local handicrafts and sideline industries to increase the people's income.

    1. Restoring and Developing Agricultural Production: First, supplement farm tools, increase draft animals, and raise pigs and sheep to overcome the current difficulties of lacking farm tools, draft animals, and fertilizer. From a long-term and overall perspective, no more wasteland should be reclaimed in mountainous areas. However, slopes that can be terraced should be terraced as quickly as possible, and efforts should be concentrated on increasing the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land. In areas with suitable conditions, construct ponds, dams, and canals, dig wells, and expand irrigation areas. Manage rivers, prevent floods, control mountain gullies, build reservoirs, and implement soil and water conservation measures. In areas lacking grain, promote the cultivation of high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, and pumpkins. In areas where grain is sufficient, promote the planned cultivation of cash crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco to increase the people's income.

    2. Developing Forestry: Promote closing hillsides for afforestation, prohibit burning mountains for land reclamation, indiscriminate logging, and digging up tree roots. However, it is necessary to take into account the current production and livelihood needs of the people, oppose mechanical closures, and carry out rational logging. In areas with suitable conditions, actively develop economic forests such as tea, mulberry, tung, rubber, tea oil, lacquer, fruit trees, as well as timber and fuelwood forests. Also, develop sideline industries such as collecting medicinal herbs and bamboo and wood weaving according to local conditions.

    3. Developing Animal Husbandry: To increase the income of the people in old revolutionary areas, increase livestock, fertilizer, and supply raw materials for wool spinning and leather making, vigorously increase cattle, sheep, horses, donkeys, camels, pigs, chickens, etc. Improve breeding techniques and reward reproduction. Strengthen livestock disease prevention and control and breed improvement. To this end, planned establishment of epidemic prevention organizations and breeding farms and insemination stations is required.

    4. Developing Handicrafts and Sideline Industries: In many old revolutionary base areas, sideline income accounts for 30 to 40 percent of total income, and sometimes even exceeds agricultural production income. Rural sideline industries and handicrafts are diverse and must be restored and developed according to local conditions and in a planned manner. Cooperatives and state-owned trade organizations should do their best to help them open up sales channels to increase the income of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. Some areas should especially promote the processing of local specialties and agricultural products, such as papermaking, silk reeling, liquor making, and egg beating. In areas with severe animal pests, organize the masses to hunt.

    5. Mining: Old revolutionary base areas are mostly mountainous with rich mineral resources such as coal, iron, lime, tungsten, and tin. Without damaging mineral deposits or affecting large-scale mining, local people can be supported in small-scale mining according to mining regulations.

    (3) Precisely because the old revolutionary base areas are mostly remote and impoverished mountainous areas, to achieve rapid recovery and development of economic construction and improvement of people's lives, the following issues must be resolved first:

    1. Restore and open up transportation, which is the key to improving the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. It is necessary to assign responsibilities at different levels and adopt the method of mobilizing the masses for voluntary labor supplemented by state funding. Plan to repair major transportation arteries in the old areas such as highways, cart roads, mule tracks, pedestrian roads, and rivers. Utilize all possible means of transportation such as carts, wheelbarrows, boats, and rafts. Also, help the masses to add these means of transportation and develop the transportation industry. Establish transshipment stations to organize transportation to facilitate the sale of local products and supply the mountainous people with the means of production and means of livelihood they need.

    2. Increase the number of state trade organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives, organize private merchants to go to the mountains, establish a commercial network in mountainous areas, and promote material exchanges. Cooperatives should focus on developing mountainous areas, guide the masses to improve product quality, conduct specification education, so that local specialties can be sold well. Trading companies and cooperatives should purchase mountain goods and local products in the spirit of not making money from the people in the old revolutionary base areas, and even adopting some subsidy methods, and solve the daily necessities such as oil and salt.

    3. Vigorously organize cooperation and mutual assistance. Under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, adopt various forms such as mutual aid teams and cooperatives for animal husbandry, afforestation, and beach improvement to gradually organize the masses. In areas with suitable conditions, agricultural production cooperatives can be appropriately promoted.

    4. In the future, general loans should prioritize old revolutionary areas. Special loans for raising livestock, repairing water conservancy, repairing terraces, and purchasing agricultural tools should be provided according to local conditions. When providing loans, attention should be paid to appropriately extending the term, simplifying procedures, and promptly disbursing them. The special relief funds allocated to the old revolutionary base areas this time should be issued in conjunction with production, or a portion should be allocated as a construction fund.

    5. The old revolutionary base areas have suffered severe war damage, the production level is low, and the people's lives are very difficult. To help the people in the old areas quickly recover, the burden should be appropriately adjusted at the provincial level. For particularly difficult old areas, a certain period of exemption from public grain can be announced.

    (4) Strengthen cultural education, medical and health care, and preferential treatment work in the old revolutionary base areas:

    1. The people in the old revolutionary base areas generally have a high political level, and their demand for cultural life is particularly urgent. It is necessary to promote culture to the countryside, movies to the mountains, popularize social education, and increase the number of primary schools, middle schools, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and various technical schools in these areas to cultivate intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds and various specialized talents. To this end, education funds and teachers should be appropriately adjusted at the provincial level.

    2. The people in the old revolutionary base areas also have very urgent needs for medical and health care. Health authorities should work with relevant departments to vigorously carry out health and epidemic prevention campaigns in the old revolutionary base areas, publicize health and childcare knowledge, establish health stations and hospitals, dispatch medical teams to provide mobile treatment, run health care personnel training courses, new midwifery training courses, help traditional Chinese medicine practitioners learn, and establish traditional Chinese medicine shops. Also, pay attention to supplying sea salt and kelp to avoid diseases such as goiter and cretinism, and protect the health of the masses.

    3. In terms of preferential treatment, the first priority is to collect and bury the remains of martyrs and collect the deeds of martyrs. There are many families of revolutionary martyrs in the old revolutionary base areas, and they lack labor and have the most difficulties in production and life. In the past, some places did not implement the preferential treatment regulations well. In the future, the preferential treatment regulations must be effectively implemented, and the work of cultivating land on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs who lack labor must be strengthened to ensure that their lives are no lower than those of ordinary farmers. Counties and districts should regularly hold representative meetings of families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and models of preferential treatment in order to review preferential treatment work, exchange experiences in cultivating land on behalf of others, and conduct political education. Representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary disabled soldiers should also participate in people's representative meetings at all levels.

    (5) The work in the old revolutionary base areas is a glorious task and should be included as an item in the performance evaluation of relevant provinces and special districts. People's governments at all levels in jurisdictions with old revolutionary base areas should make the restoration and construction of these areas one of the key tasks in 1952 and organize special committees to designate capable cadres to regularly pay attention to the work in the old revolutionary base areas and promptly inspect and supervise. Hold good representative meetings of the old revolutionary base areas, and make strengthening economic construction the main content of the meetings. Except for those who were liberated later and whose land reform has not been completed or has just been completed, the people's representative meetings of counties, districts, and townships in general old revolutionary base areas should exercise the functions and powers of people's congresses. Those who have not established people's representative meetings in districts and townships should quickly establish them so that the people of the old revolutionary base areas, who are rich in fighting experience and political awareness, can discuss and carry out their own affairs, elect their own administrative personnel, and promote the enthusiasm of the people to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory."

    It must be recognized that the restoration work in the old revolutionary base areas is a long-term task. Provinces with old revolutionary base areas in their jurisdictions should formulate practical and feasible work plans for the old revolutionary base areas based on local conditions, lead the masses to gradually realize them, and provide necessary and possible economic support to strive to change the economic outlook of the old revolutionary base areas in three to five years, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people in the old revolutionary base areas on the basis of economic development.

    中央人民政府政务院关于
    加强老根据地工作的指示
    （一）中央人民政府派遣访问团访问各老根据地并邀请各老根据地人民代表来京参加国庆节观礼，加强了中央人民政府及各级人民政府与老根据地人民的联系，表扬了老根据地人民伟大的革命功绩，提高了老根据地人民热爱祖国和建设祖国的积极性。这一收获是很大的。
    老根据地人民长期对帝国主义、国民党匪帮、封建地主进行残酷的斗争，贡献最大，牺牲和受到的摧残也最大。解放后经过积极生产，部分地区已经恢复，有的地区甚至超过战前水平，但大部分老根据地因遭受战争创伤太重，且地处山区，交通不便，生产恢复很慢；其中若干地区又遭到水旱灾害的侵袭，特别是南方老根据地因重获解放为时较晚，荒芜现象仍多数存在，人民生活极为困难。因此，无论从政治上或经济上都必须十分重视加强老根据地的工作，大力领导与扶植老根据地人民恢复与发展经济建设与文化建设。
    （二）加强老根据地的经济建设，是加强老根据地工作的中心环节。老根据地多系山地，生产条件比较困难，应该本解决群众当前生活困难与长期建设相结合的方针，因地制宜，有计划地有重点地逐步恢复与发展农林畜牧与副业生产。一般地区应以农业为主，不宜耕耘的山岳地带应以林业与畜牧业为主，但均须同时极力注意利用当地一切条件发展当地有可能发展的手工业和副业，以增加群众收入。
    1、恢复与发展农业生产：首先要补充农具，增加耕畜，养猪养羊，以克服当前缺乏农具、耕畜和肥料的困难。从长期与全局打算，山地应不再开荒，但凡能修成梯田的坡地，要尽快地逐步修成梯田，并集中力量提高现有耕地的单位面积产量。在有条件的地区，修塘，筑坝，开渠，打井，扩大灌溉面积；治河，防洪，闸山沟，修水库，做好水土保持。在粮食缺乏的地区，应提倡增种多产作物如红薯、马铃薯、南瓜等；在不缺粮食的地区应有计划地提倡栽种经济作物如棉、麻、烟等，以增加群众收入。
    2、发展林业：提倡封山育林，禁止烧山燎荒，滥伐林木，挖掘树根，但必须照顾群众当前生产与生活的需要，反对机械的封死，进行合理的砍伐。在有条件地区应积极发展茶、桑、桐、橡、茶油、漆、果树等经济林木及其他用材林、薪炭林，并根据当地条件发展采集药材及竹木编制等副业。
    3、发展畜牧：为增加老区人民收入，增加畜力、肥料，并供应毛纺制革原料，应大力增殖牛、羊、马、驴、骆驼、猪、鸡等。提高饲养技术，奖励繁殖。加强畜疫防治，畜种改良。为此，应有计划地建立防疫组织与繁殖场，配种站。
    4、发展手工业与副业：许多老根据地农村副业收入占全部收入的百分之三、四十以上，有的甚至超过农业生产的收入。农村副业和手工业是多种多样的，必须因地制宜有计划地加以恢复与发展，合作社和国营贸易机关应尽力帮助他们打开销路，以增加老根据地人民的收入。有些地区应特别提倡土特产与农产品的加工，如造纸浆、缫丝、烧酒、打蛋等。在兽害严重地区应组织群众打猎。
    5、开采矿产：老根据地多系山地，各种矿产如煤、铁、石灰、钨、锡等蕴藏丰富，在不破坏矿藏、不影响大规模开采的原则下，可以有计划地扶助当地群众按照开矿的规定作小型开采。
    （三）正因为老根据地多系偏僻穷困的山区，要求得老根据地经济建设的迅速恢复与发展和人民生活的改善，就必须首先解决以下几个问题：
    1、恢复与开辟交通，这是改善老根据地人民生活的主要关键。必须分级负责，采取发动群众义务劳动为主、国家出资为辅的办法，有计划地修好老区主要的交通干线如公路、大车路、驮骡路、人行路以及河道等，利用当地一切可能利用的交通工具如大车、手推车、船筏等，并扶助群众添置这些交通工具，发展运输业。建立转运货站，把运输工作加以组织，以利推销土产和供应山区人民所需要的生产资料与生活资料。
    2、增设国家贸易机构与供销合作社，组织私商上山，建立山区商业网，促进物资交流。合作社应以山区为发展重点之一，指导群众提高产品质量，进行规格教育，使当地土特产得到畅销。贸易公司、合作社应在对老根据地人民不挣钱甚至采取若干贴补办法的精神下，收购山货、土产，并解决油盐等日用必需品。
    3、大力组织合作互助。在自愿互利的原则下，采取多种多样的形式，如互助组及养畜、造林、修滩等合作社，逐步把群众组织起来，有条件的地区可适当提倡农业生产合作社。
    4、今后一般贷款应将老区列为重点之一。并应依据当地条件举办养牲畜、修水利、修梯田、购买农具等特殊贷款。举办贷款时应注意适当延长期限，简化手续，及时放发。这次拨给老根据地的特别救济费，应结合生产发出，或提出一部作为建设基金。
    5、老根据地遭受的战争创伤深重，生产水平较低，人民生活很苦，为帮助老区人民迅速恢复元气，在负担上应以省为单位，适当加以调整。特别困难的老区，可宣布免纳一定时间的公粮。
    （四）加强老根据地的文化教育、医疗卫生与优抚工作：
    1、老根据地人民的政治水平一般较高，对文化生活的要求尤为迫切，必须提倡文化下乡，电影上山，普及社会教育，并在这些地区增办小学、中学、工农速成中学和各种技术学校，以培养工农出身的知识分子及各种专门人才。为此，应以省为单位适当调剂教育经费与教员。
    2、老根据地人民的医药卫生要求也十分迫切。卫生机关应协同有关部门在老根据地以大力开展卫生防疫运动，宣传卫生保育知识，设立卫生站与医院，派遣医疗队巡回治疗，开办卫生医疗人员训练班，新法接生训练班，帮助中医学习，设立中药铺。并注意供应海盐、海带等以避免粗脖子、柳拐子等病症，保护群众健康。
    3、在优抚工作上，首先是收葬烈士遗骸，收集烈士事迹。老根据地烈军属多，他们缺乏劳动力，生产与生活困难最多，过去有些地方对优抚条例的贯彻施行较差，今后必须切实执行优抚条例，加强对缺乏劳力的烈军属的代耕工作，保证他们的生活不低于一般农民。县、区应定期召开烈军属、革命残废军人和优抚模范的代表会议，以便检查优抚工作，交流代耕经验，进行政治教育。各级人民代表会议也应有烈军属及革命残废军人的代表参加。
    （五）老根据地的工作是一件光荣的任务，应作为有关省、专署考绩中的一项。凡辖区内有老根据地的各级人民政府要把老根据地的恢复与建设工作作为一九五二年的工作重点之一，并组织专门委员会，指定得力干部经常注意老根据地的工作，及时检查、督促。开好老根据地的代表会，并将加强经济建设作为会议的主要内容。除重获解放的时间较晚、土地改革尚未完成或刚刚完成不久者外，一般老根据地的县、区、乡人民代表会议均应代行人民代表大会的职权，未建立区、乡人民代表会议者，应迅速建立区、乡人民代表会议，使富有斗争经验与政治认识的老根据地人民自己起来讨论与执行自己的事，选举自己的行政人员，发扬人民的积极性，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。
    必须认识老根据地的恢复工作是长期性的工作。凡辖区内有老根据地的省份，应根据当地具体情况，拟订切实可行的老根据地工作计划，领导群众逐步实现。并予以必要而又可能的经济扶植，争取在三、五年内改变老根据地的经济面貌，在经济发展的基础之上提高老根据地人民的物质生活与文化生活的水平。
    总理周恩来
    一九五二年一月二十八日
