    胜利公债第二次还本抽签大会昨在京举行
    一九五零年第一期人民胜利折实公债第二次还本抽签大会，一日下午在北京长安大戏院举行。中央人民政府财政部副部长王绍鏊、中国人民银行总行行长南汉宸亲自主持抽签仪式；中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会筹备处筹备委员巩天民和中华全国总工会办公厅秘书主任秦达远两人执行抽签。监督抽签的有中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会副主任潘震亚、中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会财政金融贸易处副处长尹伯兮、上海市工商界代表项叔翔、天津市工商界代表李钟楚、重庆市工商界代表温少鹤、北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会代表孙孚凌。此外，出席监督抽签的，还有中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国农工民主党、九三学社等团体的代表。
    王绍鏊在抽签以前致词说：在目前国家财政还不很宽裕的情况下，人民政府按期归还公债本息，这说明人民政府是极端重视债信的；希望中签的债券所有人，把兑取的公债本息，运用到正当的事业上去。接着，监督抽签的各地代表项叔翔、李钟楚、温少鹤、孙孚凌等也都讲了话，他们都表示响应政府增产节约的号召，并建议各地工商界把中签公债本息投资到生产事业上去，或把它储蓄起来。  （新华社）
