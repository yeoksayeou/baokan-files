　　On the Kashmir Issue
    ——Malik's Speech at the United Nations Security Council Meeting on January 17, 1952
    More than four years have passed since the Security Council began reviewing the Kashmir issue. Throughout this period, and now, the United States and Britain have actively participated in discussions of this issue in the Security Council, participating in the preparation and implementation of so-called plans to resolve it. Throughout this period, the representatives of the United States and Britain have put forward many proposals and drafts on this issue in the Security Council, and have, as they wished, had them passed in the Security Council. A committee for resolving the Kashmir issue has been established and mediators and United Nations representatives have been dispatched to resolve this issue. However, no progress has been made on resolving the Kashmir issue to this day. The representatives of the United States and Britain have played a leading role in these committees and in formulating plans to resolve the issue through mediation and through representatives. In 1950, the Australian Dixon served as the United Nations Representative to Kashmir. After his mission failed, at the insistence of the United States, he was replaced by the American Graham, who has now submitted a report to the Security Council. However, Graham has also met the same fate as his predecessor. The Kashmir issue remains unresolved. The dispute between India and Pakistan continues. As before, the United States and Britain continue to interfere in the resolution of the Kashmir issue, putting forward one plan after another, but all these plans have failed.

    What is the reason why the Kashmir issue remains unresolved, and the plans of the United States and Britain regarding Kashmir have proven ineffective from the point of view of resolving the Kashmir issue? It is not difficult to see that this can be explained first and foremost by one fact: that these plans regarding Kashmir have an aggressive, imperialist nature, because they are not based on a desire to genuinely resolve the Kashmir issue. They pursue other, directly opposite goals. These plans represent interference by the United States and Britain in the internal affairs of Kashmir, prolonging the dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue, and turning Kashmir into a trusteeship of the United States and Britain under the pretext of providing assistance to Kashmir through the United Nations. Finally, these plans regarding Kashmir aim to send the troops of the United States and Britain into Kashmir, turning Kashmir into a colony of the United States and Britain, and into a military strategic stronghold.

    In an attempt to realize these plans regarding Kashmir, the United States and Britain simultaneously take all measures to deny the people of Kashmir the opportunity to determine their fate free from any external oppression and free from Anglo-American interference. Using the guise of democratic slogans, the United States and Britain have from the outset intended to force the people of Kashmir to accept their orders, forcing them to decide on the question of their destiny not through the free expression of their will, but under the orders of American representatives who are covering themselves with the name of the United Nations.

    The United States and Britain are taking all measures to obstruct the resolution of the question of Kashmir's status through the free and unimpeded expression of the will of the people of Kashmir. Everyone knows that in October 1950, when the Standing Committee of the "Jammu and Kashmir National Conference" passed a resolution recommending the convening of a constituent assembly in Kashmir to determine the future structure and status of Kashmir, the United States and Britain immediately interfered in this matter, attempting to obstruct the people of Kashmir from independently determining their destiny and determining the status of their country. They hastily forced the Security Council to accept a resolution stating that the convening of a constituent assembly in Kashmir and all measures that the constituent assembly might attempt to take to determine the future structure and status of Kashmir or any part of it would not be considered a decision on the future destiny of Kashmir.

    This is nothing but reckless interference by the United States and Britain in the internal affairs of the people of Kashmir and a blatant violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter. It is well known that the United Nations Charter stipulates the equality of rights of large and small nations. One of the most important principles included in Article 1 of the Charter stipulates the development of friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.

    Under the guise of so-called resolution of the Kashmir issue, the plans of the United States and Britain greatly violate this important principle of the United Nations Charter. These plans deprive the people of Kashmir of their right to self-determination, attempting to replace self-determination with Anglo-American orders. The people of Kashmir have been deprived of the possibility of independently and freely determining their destiny and determining the future structure and status of Kashmir by means of the free expression of their will. The aforementioned proposals of the United States and Britain force the people of Kashmir to accept a "plebiscite under United Nations supervision." In other words, a plebiscite under the supervision of Anglo-American representatives, not only under the supervision of these representatives, but also under the supervision of Anglo-American armed forces. The joint proposal submitted by the representatives of the United States and Britain to the Security Council on February 21, 1951 (Document S-2017), under the pretext of sending the reinforcements of the member states of the United Nations to Kashmir, directly requested the entry of foreign troops into Kashmir. As an excuse for sending troops to Kashmir, they insisted that these troops were needed to promote demilitarization and implement the plebiscite. Under the aforementioned pretext, the proposal blatantly requested authorization for the so-called United Nations Representative to Kashmir to handle the issue of leading the "troops of the member states of the United Nations" into Kashmir. If we think about the fact that since then, an American has been appointed as the United Nations Representative to Kashmir at the request of the United States, then the proposal to send the armed forces of the member states of the United Nations into Kashmir becomes very clear. Everyone knows that this American "United Nations Representative" went to Kashmir accompanied by a large number of American experts and advisors, and among these people, military experts and advisors accounted for the majority. An American general served as the chief military advisor.

    Later, due to the opposition of the Indian representative, the suggestion put forward by the United States and Britain regarding the deployment of troops from the member states of the United Nations to Kashmir was deleted from the resolution, but only in form. In fact, the plan to deploy US and British troops under the guise of "United Nations forces" was not only retained, but measures were also taken to implement these plans. It was this so-called United Nations Representative to Kashmir, Mr. Graham, who revived this plan in his actual activities in Kashmir, India, and Pakistan.

    This can be seen from Graham's report submitted to the Security Council on December 18, 1951. The annex to this report contains a question asked to India and a question asked to Pakistan. These questions were raised by Mr. Graham to the governments of these two countries. Both questions contained the following question: Is the Government of India (Government of Pakistan) prepared to agree that within a period deemed necessary by the United Nations organization after consulting with the governments of India and Pakistan, troops will be deployed throughout Jammu and Kashmir to ensure security and maintain law and order?

    Naturally, the question arises: On what basis did Mr. Graham raise this question to the governments of India and Pakistan? Who gave him this power?

    Everyone knows that due to the opposition of one of the parties concerned, the Security Council's resolution did not include the suggestion put forward by the representatives of the United States and Britain in February 1951, which was that the Security Council's resolution should authorize the United Nations Representative to Kashmir to consider the issue of deploying troops from the member states of the United Nations to Kashmir. Therefore, the resolution determining the scope of authority of the United Nations Representative to Kashmir does not include any authority to deal with the issue of deploying foreign troops to Kashmir.

    Mr. Graham had no authority to raise this question to the governments of India and Pakistan without notifying the Security Council and without authorization from the Security Council. However, he actually raised this question to the aforementioned two governments.

    Naturally, the question arises: Who authorized him to do so? The Security Council did not authorize it. Then who authorized it? There is only one answer: Mr. Graham obviously obtained this power directly from Washington, from the Pentagon.

    Based on all this, it appears that Mr. Graham, as a representative of the United Nations, has exceeded his authority, and he is also pursuing the general line of the Anglo-American bloc, trying to use his power to create reasons for deploying US and British troops to Kashmir under the guise of "United Nations forces."

    All this fully exposes the true nature of the plans and intentions of the United States and Britain towards Kashmir. The four years of Security Council discussions on the Kashmir issue fully demonstrate the aggressive, imperialist nature of these plans. From the very beginning, the United States and Britain have embarked on the path of interfering in the internal affairs of the people of Kashmir. For example, we all remember the fact that the United States and Britain directly interfered in the Kashmir issue, that is, US President Truman and British Prime Minister Attlee put forward a proposal in August 1949, advocating that the Kashmir issue be submitted to a third party for mediation. Countries related to this issue were subjected to pressure. This pressure was so effective that, for example, the Indian Prime Minister had to say in a speech: Some people are trying to exert pressure on the Indian government, especially on the Kashmir issue. The Indian Prime Minister said: He had never seen such a thing, this pressure proved that these issues were not being considered because of their content, but entirely for other reasons.

    This proves that from the very beginning, the United States and Britain have been working to force the people of Kashmir to accept their "mediation," and to deceive the people of Kashmir and the governments of India and Pakistan with their suggestions. It is this policy of the United States and Britain that hinders the resolution of the Kashmir issue and makes it impossible for the people of Kashmir to independently determine their own destiny in accordance with the principle of self-determination stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

    The United States and Britain attempt to force the people of Kashmir to accept their mediation or a mandatory plebiscite "under United Nations supervision," and try their best to make the people of Kashmir subject to their control, forcing the people of Kashmir to accept their will. The actual goals and intentions of the United States towards Kashmir have long been no secret. Newspapers around the world have repeatedly pointed out that the United States does not want the Kashmir issue to be resolved, but strives to control Kashmir. For example, even the Pakistani newspaper "Today" believes that the purpose pursued by the US plan is to place Kashmir under the direct control of the United States, and the purpose of these plans is to ensure that the United States obtains military bases in Kashmir, because Kashmir's border is close to the Soviet border.

    Newspapers in November of last year also published a conversation with a Pakistani reporter who had officially gone to the UK for interviews. It was generally pointed out that members of the British Parliament, in conversations with this reporter, openly said that Kashmir should play a certain role in the US anti-communist plan, and the issue of allowing the United States to establish military bases in Kashmir has already been predetermined.

    These news reports have clarified the true intentions of the United States and Britain towards Kashmir, and have revealed the essence of those conspiracy plans that the United States and Britain are so stubbornly and annoyingly forcing the people of Kashmir to accept. American newspapers have also repeatedly pointed out that the United States is determined to make Kashmir and its people subject to American rule and turn the territory of Kashmir into an American military base. For example, "The Christian Science Monitor" reported: In any future conflict with Soviet Russia, the United States hopes to have Pakistan and Kashmir as its allies, an ally that is extremely important in a strategic sense and should be well prepared.

    The plans of the United States and Britain towards Kashmir have the nature of annexation, and this is clearly understood in Kashmir as well. Sadiq, Chairman of the Kashmir Constituent Assembly, said in a recent speech: The sole purpose of the United States and Britain is to turn Kashmir into a military base for attacking Russia and New China, and it is precisely for this reason that they are so urgently busy dealing with this issue.

    All these facts prove that the interference of the United States and Britain in Kashmir affairs is the main obstacle to the resolution of the Kashmir issue. In the concrete example of the so-called resolution of the Kashmir issue, people around the world have once again realized that if the Anglo-American ruling bloc uses their annexationist, imperialist plans that pursue aggressive goals to interfere in the resolution of issues related to the fate of this or that nation, then the smooth resolution of this type of issue is impossible. It is precisely because the Anglo-American plans for Kashmir have an annexationist, imperialist nature, from the point of view of resolving the Kashmir issue, that the obstinacy of the Anglo-American plans forces the Security Council and the United Nations to deal with an issue, that is, to seek the correct way to resolve the Kashmir issue. When resolving this issue, people should be guided by the principles of equality of all nations and national self-determination stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and under these conditions, the correct path can be found. In accordance with this principle, the people of Kashmir, like other nations, have the right to hold their own destiny in their own hands. The people of Kashmir enjoy the full right to express their views on the future institutions and status of their country in a democratic and peaceful manner, without external interference, and must not be forced to accept the will of foreigners. The United States and the Anglo-American bloc must stop interfering in Kashmir affairs. This will be the only correct way to resolve the Kashmir issue.

    The Soviet government believes that the Kashmir issue can only be resolved smoothly if the people of Kashmir are given the opportunity to decide on the political status of Kashmir themselves without external interference. The Constituent Assembly that determines the status of Kashmir, an assembly democratically elected by the people of Kashmir, can achieve this goal. Such a resolution of the Kashmir issue also conforms to the basic aims and principles of the United Nations Charter, especially Article 1 of the Charter, which stipulates that one of the purposes of the United Nations organization is to "develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples," that is, to respect the right of all nations to determine their own destiny.

　　关于克什米尔问题
    ——马立克一九五二年一月十七日在联合国安全理事会会议上的演说
    自从安全理事会开始审查克什米尔问题以来，四年多的时间已经过去了。美国和英国在这整个时期和在现在一直都在安全理事会中积极参加讨论这一个问题，参加准备和实行所谓解决这一个问题的计划。在这整个时期，美国和英国的代表们在安全理事会中提出了很多关于这个问题的提案和草案，并且如愿以偿地使它们在安全理事会通过了。解决克什米尔问题的委员会已经成立，并已派遣调解人和联合国代表去解决这一个问题。然而关于解决克什米尔问题一事至今并未前进一步。在这些委员会中，以及在拟订经由调解和经由代表以解决这个问题的计划方面，美国和英国的代表一直起着主导的作用。在一九五○年，澳大利亚人迪逊担任联合国驻克什米尔的代表。在他的使命失败以后，由于美国的强求，他的位置由美国人葛拉罕所代替，目前葛拉罕已向安全理事会提出了一份报告。然而葛拉罕也遭遇到和他的前任同样的命运。克什米尔问题依旧没有得到解决。印度和巴基斯坦的争执还在继续下去。和先前一样，美国和英国继续干涉着克什米尔问题的解决，提出了一个接着一个的计划，然而所有这一切的计划都失败了。
    克什米尔问题至今未能解决，美国和英国关于克什米尔的计划从解决克什米尔问题的观点上说已证明无效，到底是什么缘故呢？不难看到：这可以首先和主要地用一件事实来说明它，即：关于克什米尔的这些计划具有一种侵略的帝国主义的性质，因为它们不是依照着真正解决克什米尔问题的愿望的。它们追求其他的直接相反的目的。这些计划代表美英两国干涉克什米尔的内政，延长印度和巴基斯坦关于克什米尔问题的争执，借口经由联合国给予克什米尔以援助而把克什米尔变成美英两国的托管区。最后，关于克什米尔的这些计划旨在把美英两国的军队开到克什米尔境内，把克什米尔变成美英两国的殖民地，变成军事战略据点。
    为了企图实现关于克什米尔的这些计划，美国和英国同时采取一切措施，不给克什米尔人民以不受任何外来的压迫和不受英美的干涉去决定他们的命运的机会。美国和英国借着民主的辞句作为幌子，一开始就打算强制克什米尔人民接受他们的命令，强迫他们不通过自由表现的意志而在用联合国名义掩饰自己的美国代表们的命令之下去决定关于他们的命运的问题。
    美国和英国正在采取一切措施，去阻挠经由克什米尔人民自由而无阻碍地表示意志，以解决关于克什米尔的地位的问题。大家都知道，在一九五○年十月，当“查谟和克什米尔国民会议”常务理事会通过议案，建议在克什米尔召集制宪议会以确定克什米尔未来的构成及地位时，美国和英国立刻干涉这一件事情，企图阻挠克什米尔人民独立决定他们的命运和决定他们国家的地位。它们赶忙强制安全理事会接受一个议案，这个议案称：在克什米尔召集制宪议会和制宪议会为确定克什米尔或它的任何一部分的未来的构成和地位可能企图采取的一切措施，将不被认为是关于克什米尔将来命运的一个决定。
    这除了美英两国卤莽地干涉克什米尔人民的内政和公然违反联合国宪章的原则以外是没有别的。人所共知，联合国宪章是规定大小国家的权利的平等的。宪章第一条所包括的最重要的原则之一，规定在尊重各国人民平等权利和自决原则的基础上发展国际间的友好关系。
    在所谓解决克什米尔的问题的幌子下面，美国和英国的计划大大地违反了联合国宪章的这一个重要的原则。这些计划剥夺了克什米尔人民的自决权，企图用英美的命令代替自决权。克什米尔人民被剥夺了用自由表示意志的方法独立而自由地决定他们的命运和决定克什米尔的未来的构成与地位的可能性。上述英美两国的提案强制克什米尔人民接受“在联合国监督下的公民投票”。换句话说，就是在美英两国代表监督下的公民投票，不但是在这些代表的监督之下，而且是在英美武装部队的监督之下。美国和英国的代表们在一九五一年二月二十一日向安全理事会提出的联合提案（文件——二○一七），借口要把联合国会员国的增援部队开到克什米尔去，直接要求把外国军队开入克什米尔境内。作为派遣军队到克什米尔去的一个借口，它们硬说需要这些军队去促成非军事化和贯彻公民投票。提案在上述的借口之下明目张胆地要求授权所谓联合国驻克什米尔代表，处理率领“联合国会员国的军队”进入克什米尔的问题。倘若我们想一下从那时起已经依照美国的要求任命一个美国人作为联合国驻克什米尔代表的话，那么关于将联合国会员国的武装部队开入克什米尔的提案就会变得非常明显了。大家都知道：这个美国的“联合国代表”是由一大批美国专家与顾问伴随着到克什米尔去的，而在这帮人们之中，军事的专家和顾问占多数。美国的一位将军担任军事总顾问的职务。
    后来，由于印度代表的反对，决议中删除了美英提出的关于把联合国会员国的军队调到克什米尔境内的建议，但是只在形式上删除。而事实上，关于假借“联合国军”名义把美英军队调去的计划不但被保留了，而且还采取了实行这些计划的措施。正是这个所谓联合国驻克什米尔代表葛拉罕先生使这个计划在他在克什米尔、印度和巴基斯坦的实际活动中复活起来的。
    这可以从葛拉罕在一九五一年十二月十八日提交安全理事会的报告中看得出来。这个报告的附件中含有向印度征询的一个问题以及向巴基斯坦征询的一个问题。这些问题都是由葛拉罕先生向这两国政府提出的。这两个问题都包含着下面的问题：印度政府（巴基斯坦政府）准备同意联合国组织在它与印度和巴基斯坦两国政府协商之后认为必要的期限之内，调派军队到查谟和克什米尔全境，去保障安全并维持法律和秩序吗？
    自然就发生了这样的问题：葛拉罕先生是根据什么向印度和巴基斯坦两国政府提出这个问题的？谁给了他这样的权力？
    大家都知道，由于有关双方之中一方的反对，安全理事会的决议并没有列入美国和英国代表在一九五一年二月间提出的建议，这个建议是：安全理事会的决议应授权联合国驻克什米尔代表，考虑关于把联合国会员国的军队调到克什米尔的问题。因此，安全理事会确定联合国驻克什米尔代表权力范围的决议中，并不包含处理调派外国军队到克什米尔这一问题的任何权力。
    葛拉罕先生在不通知安全理事会并且没有经过安全理事会授权的情形之下，是没有权力向印度和巴基斯坦两国政府提出这个问题的。然而，他竟然向上述两国政府提出这个问题了。
    自然就发生了这样的问题：谁授权叫他这样做的？安全理事会没有授权。那末是谁授权的？答案只有一个，葛拉罕先生显然是直接从华盛顿、从五角大楼得到这种权力的。
    根据这一切看起来，葛拉罕先生作为一个联合国的代表是越出他的权限了，他并且奉行美英集团总的路线，尽量利用他的权力，为假借“联合国军”的名义而把美、英军队调入克什米尔一事制造理由。
    这一切完全暴露了美国和英国对克什米尔的计划与意图的真正性质。安全理事会讨论克什米尔问题的这四年的经过，完全证明了这些计划的侵略性的帝国主义性质。美国和英国从一开始起就走上了干涉克什米尔人民内政的道路。譬如，我们大家都记得美英直接干涉克什米尔问题的一个事实，就是：美国的杜鲁门总统和英国的艾德礼首相曾于一九四九年八月间提出一项建议，主张将克什米尔问题提交第三方面去调解。与这问题有关的国家都受到了压力。这种压力是这样的有效，以致印度总理，譬如说，不得不在一次演说中说：有人企图对印度政府施用压力，尤其是在克什米尔问题上面。印度总理说：他从来没有见过这样的事情，这种压力证明了对这些问题之所以不加审议，并不是因为它们的内容，而是完全因为别的理由。
    这就证明了：美国和英国从一开头的时候起，就已经着手迫使克什米尔人民接受他们的“调解”，着手拿他们的建议来蒙混克什米尔人民并且蒙混印度政府和巴基斯坦政府。正是美国和英国的这一种政策阻碍克什米尔问题的解决，使克什米尔人民不可能根据联合国宪章所规定的自决原则来自行决定自己的命运。
    美国和英国企图迫使克什米尔人民接受他们的调解或“在联合国监督下”举行强制性的公民投票，竭力要使克什米尔人民受他们支配，迫使克什米尔人民接受他们的意旨。美国对克什米尔的实际目的和意图早已不是什么秘密了。世界各国报纸已一再指出：美国并不希望克什米尔问题解决，而力图控制克什米尔。例如：甚至巴基斯坦的《今天报》也认为：美国的计划所追求的目的是在于把克什米尔置于美国的直接控制之下，这些计划的目的是要确保美国在克什米尔获得军事基地，因为克什米尔的边境靠近苏联的边境。
    去年十一月的报纸也登载了曾正式赴英采访的一个巴基斯坦记者的谈话。一般指出：英国议会的议员们，在和这个记者谈话时公开说：克什米尔应该在美国的反共计划中起一定的作用，关于让美国在克什米尔境内建立军事基地的问题已经预先决定好了。
    这些报纸上的消息已阐明了美英两国对克什米尔的真正意图，并且揭露了英美这么顽固而令人讨厌地迫使克什米尔人民接受的那些阴谋计划的实质。美国报纸也已一再指出美国一心想要使克什米尔及其人民受美国统治，而把克什米尔的领土变成美国的军事基地。例如：《基督教科学箴言报》报道：在将来与苏俄发生任何冲突中，美国都希望有巴基斯坦和克什米尔做它的盟邦，在战略意义上那是异常重要的而且应该是准备有素的一个盟邦。
    美国和英国对克什米尔的计划具有并吞的性质，这一点在克什米尔也是了解得很清楚的。克什米尔制宪议会主席萨迪克，在最近发表的一次演说中说过：英美的唯一目的在于把克什米尔变成向俄国和新中国进攻的一个军事基地，正因为这个缘故，他们才这么迫切地忙着处理这个问题。
    这一切事实证明了：美国和英国干涉克什米尔事务，乃是使克什米尔问题无法解决的主要障碍。在关于所谓解决克什米尔问题这一个具体的实例上，全世界人士又一次觉悟到：如果英美统治集团用他们那种追求侵略目的的并吞性的帝国主义计划来干涉这一个或那一个民族命运所系的问题的解决，那么，这一类问题的顺利解决便是不可能的了。正是由于英美对克什米尔的计划具有并吞性的帝国主义性质，从解决克什米尔问题的观点看来，英美计划的顽固性，使安全理事会和联合国不得不处理一项问题，就是：寻求解决克什米尔问题的正确途径。在解决这个问题的时候，人们应该以联合国宪章中所规定的各族人民平等与民族自决的原则为指导方针，在这样的条件下，就可以找到正确途径了。依照这个原则，克什米尔人民和其他各族人民一样，有权利把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里。克什米尔人民享有充分的权利按照民主与和平的方针表示他们对于自己的国家的未来机构和地位的意见，而不受外来的干涉，不得强迫他们接受外国人的意旨。美国和英美集团必须停止干涉克什米尔事务。这将是解决克什米尔问题的唯一正确途径。
    苏联政府认为，唯有让克什米尔人民不受外来的干涉而有机会自行决定克什米尔政治地位的问题，克什米尔问题才能顺利解决。确定克什米尔地位的制宪议会，由克什米尔人民用民主方式选举产生的议会，可以达到这个目的。克什米尔问题的这样的解决，也符合联合国宪章的基本宗旨与原则，特别符合宪章的第一条，其中规定联合国组织的宗旨之一是在于“发展国际间以尊重人民平等权利及自决原则为根据之友好关系”，就是说应尊重各族人民决定自己命运的权利。
