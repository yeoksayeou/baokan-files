Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 27th: According to TASS, the German people universally demand a peace treaty with Germany and a unified Germany, opposing the rearmament of West Germany.

The entire German people warmly welcome the East German government's letter to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France requesting a peace treaty, as well as the Soviet government's reply supporting the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The East German government and the Soviet diplomatic mission in Berlin are constantly receiving numerous telegrams and letters from people all over East and West Germany welcoming the proposal for a peace treaty.

The Democratic Women's League of Germany issued a declaration calling on women and mothers throughout Germany to launch a broad movement to support the East German government's demand for a peace treaty, pointing out that this demand is "aimed at guaranteeing peace and a happy future for our children." The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League issued a statement warmly supporting the Soviet government's reply. The statement said: "German youth want peace, not any 'general agreement' concluded in pursuit of war aims. We must strive forward, safeguard the cause of peace, and restore German unity!"

The Central Bureau of the Federation of Farmers' Mutual Aid Committees of East Germany issued a statement expressing gratitude for the Soviet government's reply, and pointed out that the current division of Germany is completely unjustified.

Throughout East Germany, people have held mass rallies and demonstrations to express their support for a peace treaty and welcome the Soviet reply. Eight hundred Leipzig city citizens, representing all residents of the city, wrote to the heads of the three Western occupying powers, demanding the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

In West Germany, the movement demanding a peace treaty with Germany and opposing rearmament has been combined with the movement against conscription and against the right-wing leaders in West German trade unions who support the rearmament policy. The Bavarian Trade Union, which has 900,000 union members (accounting for 20% of the total number of trade union members in West Germany), held a special representative meeting in Munich on the 14th, where a resolution was passed opposing the implementation of conscription law and West German rearmament, and protesting the policy of the right-wing leadership of the trade union organization in favor of remilitarization. This resolution was unanimously supported by the metalworkers' representative meeting held in Nuremberg on the 16th, representing 55,000 metalworkers. The metalworkers of Frankfurt am Main, the construction and metalworkers of Duisburg, the dockworkers of Bremen and Hamburg, and the representatives of more than 100,000 coal and steel workers in various industrial centers of West Germany also expressed the same view.

Bavarian youth groups belonging to many different political tendencies have organized a state-wide youth committee to oppose the conscription of young people into the army. Employees of the Bavarian Engine Factory and the Krauss-Maffei Locomotive Factory recently held a mass rally. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution firmly opposing the conscription law, pointing out that the way out for the people of West Germany is to seek mutual understanding with the people of all countries, especially the people of East Germany, rather than concluding military treaties. The resolution said: "Only the unity of Germany can maintain peace and guarantee the conclusion of a just peace treaty."

Under the powerful movement of the entire German people opposing rearmament and demanding a peace treaty, some upper-level political leaders in West Germany have also expressed their support for a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of all of Germany. Former German Imperial Chancellor Wirth, who recently visited East Germany, recently issued a statement in Freiburg after returning to West Germany, expressing his support for a unified Germany and the speedy conclusion of a final peace treaty. Dr. Teuchert, a Bavarian Party member of the Bonn Parliament, said at a rally that he opposed the rearmament of West Germany under any circumstances.

    全德人民要求缔和反对重新武装西德
    苏联政府给民主德国政府的复函受到德国人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国人民普遍要求缔结对德和约和统一的德国，反对重新武装西德。
    全德人民都热烈地欢迎德意志民主共和国政府致苏、美、英、法四国政府要求缔和的公函以及苏联政府赞成按照波茨坦协定尽速缔结对德和约的复函。德意志民主共和国政府和苏联驻柏林外交使团不断地收到来自东西德各地人民的许多欢迎缔结和约建议的电报与信件。
    德国民主妇女联合会发表了宣言，号召全德的妇女和母亲们，展开广泛的运动，支持德意志民主共和国政府所提出的缔结对德和约的要求，宣言指出，这个要求是“以保障和平和我们的孩子们的幸福的未来为目的的要求”。自由德国青年联盟中央委员会发表声明，热烈拥护苏联政府的复函。声明说：“德国青年要和约，不要为追求战争目标而缔结什么‘一般性协定’。我们要努力前进，维护和平事业，恢复德国的统一！”
    德意志民主共和国农民互助委员会联合会中央局发表声明，对苏联政府的复函表示感激，并指出德国目前存在的分裂状态是完全不正当的。
    在德意志民主共和国各地，人民纷纷举行群众大会和示威，表示拥护缔和与欢迎苏联的复函。八百个来比锡市的公民代表全市居民写信给三个西方占领国家的首脑，要求迅速缔结对德和约。
    在西德，要求缔结对德和约、反对重新武装的运动，已和反对征兵、反对西德工会中支持重新武装政策的右翼领导的运动相结合。拥有九十万工会会员（占西德工会会员总数百分之二十）的巴伐利亚工会，十四日在慕尼黑召开特别代表会议，会上通过决议，反对实施征兵法和西德重新武装，并抗议工会右翼领导机构赞成重新军国主义化的政策。这个决议受到十六日在纽伦堡举行的、代表五万五千五金工人的五金工人代表会议的一致支持。美因河畔法兰克福的五金工人，杜伊斯堡的建筑和五金工人，不来梅和汉堡的码头工人以及西德各工业中心十万以上煤、钢工人的代表也表示了同样的意见。
    属于许多不同政治倾向的巴伐利亚青年团体，组织了全州青年委员会，反对征召青年入军队。巴伐利亚发动机工厂和克劳斯玛菲机车工厂的职工新近举行了一个群众大会。大会一致通过决议，坚决反对征兵法，决议指出：西德人民的出路是和各国人民、特别是东德的人民求得互相谅解，而不是缔结军事条约，决议说：“只有德国的统一才能保持和平并保证公正的和约的缔结。”
    在全德人民强大的反对重新武装、要求缔结和约的运动下，西德的一些上层政治领袖也表示拥护缔结对德和约和统一全德。不久以前曾访问过德意志民主共和国的前德意志帝国总理维尔特回到西德后，最近曾在佛莱堡发表声明，表示赞成统一德国和迅速缔结最后和约。波恩议会巴伐利亚党议员台克尔博士在一个集会上演说说，他在任何情况下都反对重新武装西德。
