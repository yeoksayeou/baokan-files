(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st) At the February 1st meeting of the staff meeting for the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, the two sides discussed the specific details of the composition, powers, and duties of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and preliminarily reviewed all the clauses of the armistice agreement related to the second and third agenda items. At the meeting on the 1st, our side proposed that six locations, namely Sinuiju, Hamhung, and Chongjin on our side, and Busan, Incheon, and Suwon in the area under the military control of the other side, be designated as specific rear ports for the permanent stationing of Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to supervise both sides from introducing any reinforcements of military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea during the armistice. The opposing side's draft proposed that each side designate twelve locations, totaling twenty-four, as specific rear ports. Our staff pointed out that the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition within the agreed limits of both sides entering from outside Korea during the armistice would obviously be greatly reduced, and the ports of entry for military personnel and weapons and ammunition must be limited. In order to ensure that both sides effectively abide by the provisions of the agreement, both sides have already agreed that when either side of the Military Armistice Commission requests the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate violations of the agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should conduct inspections, so there is no need to designate too many permanent specific ports.
	At the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, our side's representatives continued to refute the opposing side's unreasonable proposal regarding the repatriation of civilians, and pointed out that since both sides have agreed in principle to assist displaced civilians in returning to their hometowns after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, this issue has been basically resolved. The kind of guarantee requested by the other side is unnecessary, and the other side believes that only by having its so-called neutral organizations conduct visits and talks in the vast rear areas where displaced civilians are scattered can it be considered a guarantee, which will inevitably constitute interference in our internal affairs and is therefore absolutely impermissible.

    停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议  
    讨论中立国监察问题  
    我方继续驳斥对方关于遣返平民的提案
    【新华社开城一日电】朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议二月一日的会议中，双方讨论了中立国监察委员会的组成、权力和职司的具体细节，初步地检阅了停战协定有关第二项议程和第三项议程的全部条款。我方在一日的会议中，建议以我方新义州、咸兴、清津，及对方军事控制下的地区中的釜山、仁川、水原等六个地点为中立国视察小组常驻实地视察的特定后方口岸，监督双方在停战期间不自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。对方草案建议双方各指定十二个共二十四个地点为特定后方口岸。我方参谋人员指出，停战期间自朝鲜境外进入的双方协议限度内军事人员的轮换与武器弹药的替换，显然将有大量的削减，军事人员与武器弹药的进口口岸，必须有所限制。为了保证双方切实遵守协议的规定，双方已经同意军事停战委员会中双方或任何一方向中立国监察委员会提出调查违反协议事件的请求时，中立国监察委员会即应进行视察，因此也无需指定过多的常驻特定口岸。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上我方代表继续驳斥对方关于遣返平民的不合理提案，并指出既然双方原则上同意在停战协定签字并生效后，双方协助流离失所的平民返乡，此一问题即已在基本上获得解决。对方所要求的那种保证是不必要的，而且对方以为只有由其所谓中立的机构在各失所平民所散居的后方广大地区进行访问谈话才算是保证，这不可避免地将构成对我方内政的干涉，因此是绝对不能允许的。
