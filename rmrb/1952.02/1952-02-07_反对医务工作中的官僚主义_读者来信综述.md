    Opposing Bureaucracy in Medical Work
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, this newspaper has continued to receive many letters from readers criticizing the serious bureaucratic work style of some medical workers in various places. They suggest that health leading organs pay attention to this serious phenomenon and thoroughly correct it in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.
    On November 30th last year, Zhao Wenzhang, the director of the Zhangjiakou Infectious Disease Hospital, ordered doctors Ma Zhengde and others to cooperate with Zhang Wanchang from the medical clinic of the Provincial Industrial Department to inject diphtheria toxoid into workers at the cigarette factory. After the injections, many workers' injection sites became red and swollen, and they could not work. As of December 20th, 120 people had surgery, 113 penicillin injections, 1,198 oral medications, and 785 external medications. This incident affected the production increase plan, damaged the workers' health, affected the future development of epidemic prevention work, and caused great losses to state property.
    The daughter of comrades Li Jianfei and Zhang Ming of the Political and Legal Committee suffered from pneumonia last year and was treated at the Fourth United Clinic of the Ministry of Health. However, the hospital ordered the child to be discharged before she had fully recovered. On the afternoon of January 22nd, the child's illness relapsed. Comrade Li Jianfei telegraphed Dr. Tian Jindang of the Fourth United Clinic to come to the house for treatment. Tian did not conduct a detailed examination, prescribed a prescription for treating coughs and preventing pneumonia, and left. At 5:30 p.m. that day, the child took the medicine and immediately showed symptoms of vomiting and difficulty breathing. Comrade Li Jianfei urgently telegraphed the clinic to send a doctor for further treatment. However, the registration office of the clinic adopted a method of deceiving the patient's family. The first time, the comrades at the registration office said, "The doctor is out." The second time they said, "He will be there in a while." The third time they said, "He has already gone." But at 7 o'clock, the doctor had not yet arrived. By 8 o'clock, the child's condition was critical and she was sent to the Children's Hospital, where she died despite rescue efforts.
    Reader Yuan Zhisan took his child to the emergency room of the Beijing Children's Hospital at 7 p.m. on December 7th last year. After diagnosis by Dr. Zhang Wenduan of the hospital, he instructed the nurse to get medicine. The nurse took 40 cc of glucose calcium injection, and without identifying it, injected it. Because of unskilled technique, she stabbed the child's back of the hand, arm, and foot for an hour without injecting it. By this time the child was hoarse and exhausted, and another doctor changed the injection. After the injection, the child had already stopped breathing. At this time, the doctors did not notice anything unusual and laughed at each other and left. It was not until the child's family discovered it and cried for help that the doctor turned back and gave the child artificial respiration, but it was too late to save her. Afterwards, Yuan Zhisan reported the matter to the Beijing People's Court, but the People's Court has not yet dealt with it.
    Editor's Note: Please have the relevant departments investigate the above three letters from readers and provide a public response.

### 反对医务工作中的官僚主义——读者来信综述

    反对医务工作中的官僚主义
    ——读者来信综述
    最近本报继续收到不少读者来信，批评各地若干医务工作者在工作中存在着的严重的官僚主义作风，并建议卫生领导机关，重视这一严重现象，在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，彻底地加以纠正。
    去年十一月三十日，张家口市传染病院院长赵文章令医生马正德等协同省工业厅医务所张万昌等到纸烟厂给职工注射白喉沉淀类毒素。注射后，许多工人的注射部位呈红肿状，都不能上工。截至十二月二十日止，计开刀者一百二十人，注射盘尼西林等药一百十三次，内服药一千一百九十八次，外敷药七百八十五次。这一事件，影响了增产计划，损害了工人健康，也影响了今后防疫工作的开展，对国家财产造成很大损失。
    政治法律委员会李剑飞、张明同志的女孩去年患肺炎，在中央卫生部第四联合门诊部就诊。但院方不等小孩完全痊愈，即令出院。一月二十二日下午，小孩病又复发。李剑飞同志电请第四联合门诊部田金党大夫去家诊治，田不作详细检查，开了治咳嗽防肺炎的药方就走了。当日下午五时半，孩子吃了药，即呈现呕吐并呼吸困难的症状。李剑飞同志急电门诊部请派医生再往诊治。但门诊部的挂号处却采取了欺骗病人家属的办法。第一次，挂号处的同志说“医生出去了”，第二次说“一会就去”，第三次说“已经去了”。但到七点钟，医生还没去。延至八时孩子病情危急，送儿童医院，因抢救无效死去。
    读者袁芝三在去年十二月七日晚七时抱孩子到北京市儿童医院急诊。该院张文端医生诊断后，嘱护士取药，护士取来四十西西葡萄糖钙针剂，不加识别，即行注射。因技术不熟练，在孩子手背上、胳膊上、脚上乱扎了一小时还没有注入。这时孩子已声嘶力竭，才改由另一医生注射。注射毕孩子已经断气。这时医生们竟没有发觉异状，还相顾欢笑而去。直到小孩家属发觉，大声呼救，医生才转回来，给孩子进行人工呼吸，但已无法挽救。事后，袁芝三曾把这事告到北京市人民法院，但人民法院直到现在还没有处理。
    编者按：请有关部门就以上三封读者来信进行检查并公开答复。
