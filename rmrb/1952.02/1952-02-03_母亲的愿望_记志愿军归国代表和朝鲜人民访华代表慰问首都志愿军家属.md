Mother's Wish
    ——A Record of the Visit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to Console Families of the Volunteer Army in the Capital

    In Zheng Huangqi Natural Village, Xiangshan, about forty miles west of Beijing, Pang Dianchen, a special-class meritorious person of the Volunteer Army returning delegation, and Li Jiyin, a combat hero of the Korean People's Army who won the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," visited the parents and younger sister of Zhao Guangbin, a meritorious person who rendered special-class service on the Korean front.

    It was the morning of January 25th, and a poor peasant family on the hillside of Xiangshan suddenly became so lively. An old lady of sixty-five years old – Zhao Guangbin's mother – excitedly walked out of the house to greet the distinguished guests. When she learned that they had come to see her from the distant Korean front, she was extremely happy and moved to tears. She said kindly to the two heroes, "Seeing you is like seeing my son." As the old mother spoke, she suddenly seemed to remember something and immediately turned back into the house. After a while, she came out holding a framed certificate with several large red flowers on it, containing the good news of her son's meritorious service. It was last summer when the village government and many villagers enthusiastically beat gongs and drums to deliver the good news that Zhao Guangbin had rendered special-class service on the Korean front. The two heroes looked at the good news and said happily, "Old mother, Comrade Guangbin has rendered great service on the front lines, this is your glory!" The combat hero Zhao Guangbin is an only child. His glorious old mother and 75-year-old father sent him to the Volunteer Army to fight the American devils on the Korean front. Today, his old father had already run to the welcoming rally because he heard that the Volunteer Army returning delegation and the Korean People's delegation were coming to the village, so he was unable to see his son's heroic comrades. Zhao Guangbin's family was originally very poor. Only after the land reform did they receive a few acres of land. Now his family's land is cultivated by the village on their behalf, and with the care of the People's Government, the family's life is no longer difficult. When our Volunteer Army special-class meritorious person Pang Dianchen told the old mother that he had been to Zhao Guangbin's unit, the old mother said excitedly, "When you go back, tell him that I am happy as long as he fights the American devils well at the front." The two heroes talked cordially with the old mother for a long time. When they said goodbye, the old mother repeatedly urged them to tell her son that the People's Government was taking good care of them and that her son should fight the enemy well and perform meritorious service for the people. In the end, she kindly saw them off, sending them a long way until she could no longer see them before returning. The old mother's heart deeply moved these two outstanding combat heroes. Pang Dianchen, the political instructor of the heroic company who had defended the Yanxian Mountain stronghold east of the Imjin River in Korea for three days and four nights and annihilated more than 1,200 men of the 7th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the "ace" of American imperialism, said: I haven't seen my mother for a long time. When I saw her, I felt like I was seeing my own mother. The old mother is so concerned about the revolution, and her words to her son are just like the words to our thousands of Volunteer Army comrades fighting on the Korean front. Our heroic friend, Li Jiyin, a combat hero who attacked a large number of enemy tanks with grenades, said: This old mother is like many Korean mothers; she sent her only son to the Korean front to defend the happiness of the Chinese and Korean people. The old mother's words encouraging her son to fight American imperialism further encouraged my confidence in the victory over the enemy. I am deeply grateful for the warm care of the Chinese people for the Korean people! (Attached picture)

    母亲的愿望  
    ——记志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民访华代表慰问首都志愿军家属
    柏生
    在离北京城西约四十余里的香山正黄旗自然村，我们的志愿军归国代表特等功臣庞殿臣和荣获“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”的朝鲜人民军战斗英雄李基殷，慰问了在朝鲜前线立了特等功的功臣赵广斌的父母和妹妹。
    这是一月二十五日的上午，在香山的山坡上，一个贫农家庭里，忽然显得那么热闹起来。一位六十五岁的老大娘——赵广斌的母亲从屋里兴奋地走出来迎接高贵的客人。当她知道他们是从遥远的朝鲜前线来看望她以后，她高兴极了，兴奋得落了泪。她亲切地对两位英雄说：“我看到了你们，就像看到了我的儿子。”老母亲一面说着话，忽然像想起了什么，便立即往屋里转去。不一会，她抱着一个镜框，框上还有好几朵大红花，框里装着她儿子立功的喜报。那是在去年夏天，村政府和许多村民们热烈地敲打着锣鼓送来的赵广斌在朝鲜前线立了特等功的喜报。两位英雄看了喜报，高兴地说：“老妈妈，广斌同志在前线立了大功，这是您的光荣哩！”战斗英雄赵广斌，是一个独生子，他的光荣的老母亲和七十五岁的老父亲，把他送给了志愿军，让他上朝鲜前线打美国鬼子。今天他的老父亲因为听说志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民代表要到村里来，他老早就跑去开欢迎大会去了，因此他没有能看到他儿子的这些英雄伙伴。赵广斌的家原来是很贫苦的。土地改革后才分了几亩地。现在他家的地，由村里代耕，另外加上人民政府的照顾，全家的生活已不大困难了。当我们的志愿军特等功臣庞殿臣告诉老母亲，他曾去过赵广斌的部队的时候，老母亲兴奋地说：“你回去时告诉他，只要他好好在前方打美国鬼子，我就高兴。”两位英雄和老母亲亲切地谈了许久，直到告别时，老母亲还再三地叮嘱，要他们告诉她的儿子，人民政府对她们照顾很好，要他儿子好好在前线打敌人，给人民立功。她最后亲切地送着他们，送了很远，直到再也看不见他们的时候才回去。老母亲的心，深深地感动了这两位出色的战斗英雄。曾经在朝鲜临津江以东坚守岩岘山高地三昼四夜的战斗中，和他的战友们歼灭了美帝国主义的“王牌”军美骑一师第七团一千二百余名的英雄连政治指导员庞殿臣说：我好久没有看见我的母亲了，我看见她老人家时，我像看到我自己的母亲一样。老母亲对革命这样关心，她叮嘱她儿子的话，也正像对我们千千万万战斗在朝鲜前线的志愿军同志说的话一样。我们的英雄友人，这位以手榴弹袭击敌人大量坦克的战斗英雄李基殷说：这位老母亲和多少朝鲜母亲一样，她把她的独生子送到了朝鲜前线，保卫中朝两国人民的幸福。老母亲鼓舞儿子打美帝国主义的话，更加鼓舞了我对敌人战斗胜利的信心。我深深地感激着每一个中国人民对朝鲜人民热情的关怀！（附图片）
