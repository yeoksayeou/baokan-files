    Everyone Should Learn the Spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army of Cherishing National Property

    On December 14, 1951, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued an instruction to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy throughout the army. For more than a month, all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, with their high spirit of patriotism, have enthusiastically responded to and begun to earnestly implement this instruction. This is of great significance for inspiring the people of the whole country to consciously participate in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. People know that the Volunteer Army is in a fierce war environment; while our country is in a peaceful environment. The Volunteer Army eats and sleeps in the wind and snow, while we all have a more comfortable life. The Volunteer Army in such a difficult environment has to cherish the people's property everywhere, save a lot of materials for the motherland, and carry out a resolute struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Every one of us in the country should cherish and protect the property of the country even more, resolutely rise up to thoroughly eliminate all large, medium and small corrupt elements, pursue big corrupt officials, and fight to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks.

    For corrupt elements, the patriotic actions of the Volunteer Army should make them more deeply aware of the despicable nature of their behavior and the seriousness of their crimes. Our Volunteer Army does not hesitate to sacrifice blood to protect the motherland's materials; but corrupt elements are so selfish and self-interested, trying every means to steal the motherland's wealth. They have clearly been hit by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets long ago, but some are still racking their brains to plug the sores everywhere, establish "offensive and defensive alliances," and resist the anti-corruption movement. We should seriously warn these corrupt elements: if you do not honestly confess and start anew, the people cannot tolerate you; only by thoroughly confessing and making amends for your crimes can you find the only way out.

    Those who use the wealth of the state to show their "generosity" should be told: our Volunteer Army relies on its own labor to save its own heating costs, save its own clothing, reduce the burden on the people, and use its own food to help Korean refugees. What a noble quality this is! However, those who waste damage the property of the state, often hundreds of millions, tens of billions, or even hundreds of billions of yuan at a time. The people want you to seriously protect the property of the state, but you squander the property of the state casually. Compared with the hard work of the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters on the front line, can the wasters not feel heartbroken? Can you not feel extremely ashamed?

    The Volunteer Army's spirit of cherishing national property has educated more people, making them more aware of the importance of cherishing their motherland's property in the future. Those who take a liberal attitude towards the phenomenon of destroying and stealing state wealth should learn from the Volunteer Army's spirit of thrift, clearly recognize that the property of the state is so sacred that it should not be infringed upon in the slightest, and further understand the important responsibility of cherishing state property. In order to protect the property of the country, the people of the whole country must more bravely and strongly devote themselves to the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

### 人人应该学习志愿军爱护祖国财产的精神

    人人应该学习志愿军爱护祖国财产的精神
    一九五一年十二月十四日中国共产党中国人民志愿军党委发出了在全军开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的指示，一个多月以来，志愿军的全体指战员以自己高度的爱国主义的精神，热烈地响应并已开始认真执行这个指示。这对于启发全国人民自觉地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争是有重要意义的。人们知道，志愿军所处的是激烈的战争环境；而我们国内则是和平的环境。志愿军在风雪下餐宿，而我们都有较为安适的生活。志愿军在那样艰苦的环境中还要处处爱惜人民财产，为祖国节省大量物资，还要同贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象进行坚决的斗争。我们在国内的每一个人，就更应该爱惜和保护国家的财产，坚决地起来彻底肃清一切大中小的贪污分子，穷追大贪污犯，为击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻而斗争。
    对于贪污分子来说，志愿军的爱国行动应该使自己更深刻地认识自己的行为的卑鄙和罪恶重大。我们的志愿军为了保护祖国的物资，不惜牺牲流血；而贪污分子却是那样的自私自利，千方百计地盗窃祖国的财富。他们明明早已被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹所击中，但有的现在仍在挖空心思地到处堵塞疮口，建立“攻守同盟”，抗拒反贪污运动。我们应该严重地警告这些贪污分子：你们如果不老老实实坦白自新，人民是不能宽容你们的；你们只有彻底坦白，戴罪立功，才是唯一的出路。
    应当告诉那些用国家的财富以表示自己“慷慨”的人们：我们的志愿军靠自己的劳动节省自己的烤火费，节约自己的服装，减轻人民的负担，并以自己的粮食救济朝鲜难民，这是何等高贵的品质！但是，浪费分子们损害国家的财产，动辄就是几亿、几十亿、甚至几百亿元。人民要你们认真保护国家的财产，但你们却把国家的财产随便挥霍。和志愿军指战员们在前线艰苦奋斗的情形相比，浪费者们难道能不感到痛心吗？能不感到万分羞惭吗？
    志愿军爱护祖国财产的精神教育了更多的人，使他们今后更加懂得爱护自己祖国的财产。对于破坏和盗窃国家财富的现象采取自由主义态度的人，应该学习志愿军节约的精神，明确地认识到国家的财产是如此神圣地丝毫不应受到侵犯，进一步知道爱护国家财产的重要责任。我们全国人民为了保护国家的财产，必须更加勇敢地坚强地投入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争。
