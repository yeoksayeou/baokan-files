    Workers Smash the Treachery of the Unscrupulous Merchant Hu Liangtu

    To the Editor: After the start of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion movement, Hu Liangtu, the manager of Yongxin Iron Factory, colluded with his first wife, using money to buy off the accountant, Liu Changyun (Hu's nephew). The unscrupulous merchant knew that Liu Changyun's family was having financial difficulties, so he asked someone to send two and a half million yuan to Liu's father. They instructed Liu Changyun to burn the problematic account books. Liu Changyun, having accepted the bribe, burned all the tax evasion account books from 1949 to 1950.

    The unscrupulous merchant Hu Liangtu wanted to buy off all the workers in the factory, making a set of cotton uniforms for each of them and improving the meals. He also threatened the workers, saying, "What good will you get from fighting each other!" "If the factory is brought down, you will all suffer!" He told the workers to go home for the New Year in order to disperse the workers' strength. However, no matter what methods he used or what tricks he played, he could not stop the workers from reporting him. After an intense ideological struggle, the accountant Liu Changyun recognized the unscrupulous merchant's treachery and finally exposed the crimes of the unscrupulous merchant Hu Liangtu.

    工人们粉碎了奸商呼良图的诡计
    编辑同志：永信铁工厂经理呼良图在反行贿、反偷税漏税运动开始后，就和他的大老婆狼狈为奸，用金钱收买司账员刘长运（呼的外甥）。奸商知道刘长运家庭生活比较困难，就托人给刘的父亲捎去二百五十万元。他们指使刘长运烧掉有问题的账目。刘长运受了贿赂，就把一九四九年到一九五零年的偷漏税的账目全烧毁了。
    奸商呼良图想收买全厂职工，给每人做了一套棉制服，还改善了伙食。他还威胁职工说：“你们斗来斗去，能得到什么好处！”“工厂斗倒了，你们也得受罪！”他叫工人们回家过新年，以分散工人的力量。但是，任他用尽方法，使尽花招，还是没有阻止了工人们对他的检举。司账员刘长运经过激烈的思想斗争，认识了奸商的诡计，终于揭发了奸商呼良图的罪行。    邱祖华
