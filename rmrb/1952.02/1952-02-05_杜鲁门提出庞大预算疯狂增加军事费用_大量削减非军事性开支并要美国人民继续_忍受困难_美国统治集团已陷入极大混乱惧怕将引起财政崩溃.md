Xinhua News Agency, January 31st dispatch: Washington news: U.S. President Truman presented economic and budget messages to the U.S. Congress on January 16th and 21st, respectively. These two messages show that the U.S. government is determined to further militarize the U.S. economy, thereby driving the national economy into an abyss of disaster.

In his message, Truman proposed that the total expenditure of the U.S. government from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year would be 85.4 billion U.S. dollars. This is nearly one-fifth more than the record-breaking budget for peacetime proposed by Truman at the beginning of last year. Of this total, the expenditure directly used to prepare for a new world war and the war of aggression against Korea (including the so-called "common security" funds used to arm the vassal states) is 65.1 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of about one-third from a year ago. This expenditure accounts for 73 percent of the total budget. If other expenditures related to military purposes are added, the total amounts to 85 percent of the entire budget.

While frantically increasing military spending, Truman further "greatly reduced" various non-military expenditures, a total reduction of 9 percent compared to two years ago. Among them, the expenditures directly related to the people's welfare have been reduced particularly sharply. For example, public health expenditures will be reduced by 10 percent, and agricultural relief funds will be reduced by 72 percent. Although the United States suffered the largest flood in nearly a century last year due to poor water conservancy, Truman continued to cut flood control project expenditures to only half of what they were in 1950. Although everyone remembers the recent major coal mine explosion in the United States, Truman only plans to allocate a meager 4 million U.S. dollars to improve mine safety equipment.

Truman's message illustrates the rapid militarization of the U.S. economy. The current rate of major military expenditure in the United States has reached an annual rate of 45 billion U.S. dollars, which is 2.6 times the military expenditure in the year before the outbreak of the Korean War. According to Truman's calculation, the proportion of war preparation expenditure in the national gross product has increased to two and one-third times that of that time, and it is planned to expand to three times by the end of this year. In major industrial sectors such as the metal and construction industries, military production currently accounts for a quarter of total production and will continue to increase to more than a third.

Truman's message also shows that the production of U.S. civilian industries will be further reduced. Although U.S. military production increased about three times last year, the huge reduction in the production of civilian goods has kept the total amount of U.S. industrial production at the same level as a year ago. Truman announced that in 1952, "the use of urgently needed materials in the manufacture of many peacetime goods will be reduced," therefore, "some smaller production enterprises will encounter serious problems." This situation has led to an increase in unemployment in the United States. Truman revealed in his message that although the number of employees in the so-called "defense or defense-supporting industries" in the United States increased by one and three-quarters times compared to before the Korean War, an increase of 3.5 million people by the end of 1951, the total number of employees in the same period not only did not increase, but decreased by hundreds of thousands. Among them, the number of agricultural employees decreased by 450,000 compared to a year ago.

Truman admitted that due to the government's militarization plan, the national finances have generated a "large deficit," "the production volume of consumer goods has decreased," and a large part of the national financial resources "cannot be used to improve living standards." But Truman still asks the American people to continue to "sacrifice." He demands an additional 5 billion U.S. dollars in taxes, an extension of the militarist "Defense Production Act" for another two years, and the implementation of strict wage controls. He openly told the American people that they must "endure some inconveniences and hardships" and that American taxpayers must bear a "heavy burden."

Like in his State of the Union address, Truman in his economic message once again called for not "losing confidence in our own abilities or embracing defeatism." But he cannot but admit that his militarization plan will bring greater disaster to the U.S. economy. He admitted that the U.S. economy will encounter "difficulties." He said: "Even if taxes are increased according to my proposal, it is estimated that there will still be a huge deficit this year, and the deficit next year will be even greater. This deficit, coupled with the pressure on the economy in other aspects, will increase the danger of inflation." For Truman, the biggest danger is that this policy of economic militarization will inevitably lead to a serious economic and political crisis in the United States. This point, Truman himself cannot conceal his inner unease. He even had to admit that the frenzied arms expansion movement would "exhaust our economy and weaken public support for a plan that must be carried out for a long period of time."

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st dispatch: Washington news: U.S. President Truman's huge budget of 85.4 billion U.S. dollars has caused great confusion within the U.S. ruling group. Although the U.S. bourgeois congressmen and newspapers all support Truman's government's national policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war without exception, a large part of them are afraid that if they recklessly continue like Truman, it will rapidly cause a financial collapse crisis in the United States, thereby arousing the uncontrollable resistance of the American people.

On January 21st, the day Truman presented his budget message, the United Press International specifically issued a message to make a "note" to Truman's budget, explaining that the United States is actually unable to pay for the expenditures Truman requested. The United Press International's message began by saying: "There is not that much money." Because, "the average amount of banknotes issued in the United States is about 180 yuan per person, while according to the budget, each person needs 547 yuan and 72 cents. The total amount of cash issued in the United States is about 28 billion yuan. Even if all the funds and gold used by the Ministry of Finance to support the currency are counted, there are only about 50 billion yuan in total."

Although the total amount of national expenditure cannot be completely measured by the total amount of national currency, the statistics of the United Press International clearly illustrate how absurd the budget proposed by Truman has become. In this case, according to the United Press International, "Republican leaders in Congress accused Truman's budget of being simply 'crazy,' and some influential Democrats echoed the demand to cut the budget." "They even raised this demand in Congress before the President formally announced his budget figures."

Republican congressmen have been trying their best to attack Truman's Democratic government for being extravagant and squandering the national financial resources. They issued a statement saying: "Truman's only answer to any problem is to spend money, spend more money." Democratic congressmen are even more afraid that the huge tax increases demanded by Truman will arouse the resentment of voters. Even Senator Connally, who has always defended government policies, said: "Our people can no longer bear more taxes, and I will vote against general tax increases." The "New York Times" commented on Truman's argument that a large increase in taxes can avoid inflation, saying: "The people of the whole country bear an excessive burden of taxes, but it is doubtful whether the essence of taxation has value as a weapon against inflation. On the one hand, continuing to increase taxes brings inflationary factors in itself, on the other hand, the increase in the federal deficit should be carefully considered." The San Francisco "Chronicle" also believes that government spending should be cut under conditions that do not hinder the implementation of government policies. The newspaper said: "We have no objection to Mr. Truman's statement. ... But we have never believed that this budget cannot be reduced."

Despite these various calls for budget cuts, the U.S. ruling group, while adhering to the current policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, is actually hard to escape the financial collapse they fear. A United Press International Washington dispatch on the 22nd said: "Members of both parties in Congress have vowed to cut 5 billion yuan from the highest peacetime budget of 85.4 billion proposed by President Truman, but some congressmen privately admitted that it is easy to verbally promise to cut the budget, but it is more troublesome to do it." This contradiction prominently demonstrates the fundamental contradiction of U.S. imperialism, that is, the aggressive goals are very large, but its own aggressive power is very small. This contradiction will obviously be further exposed when the U.S. Congress discusses the budget issue in the future. The San Francisco "Chronicle" has already predicted: "The budget issue will cause a lot of disputes."

    杜鲁门提出庞大预算疯狂增加军事费用  
    大量削减非军事性开支并要美国人民继续“忍受困难”  
    美国统治集团已陷入极大混乱惧怕将引起财政崩溃
    【新华社三十一日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统杜鲁门在一月十六日和二十一日先后向美国国会提出经济咨文和预算咨文。这两个咨文表明，美国政府决心使美国经济更进一步军事化，从而把国家经济驱入灾难的深渊。
    杜鲁门在咨文中提出：美国政府从今年七月一日到明年六月三十日为止的会计年度内，全部支出为八百五十四亿美元。这比杜鲁门去年初提出的美国历史上和平时期创纪录的预算又多了将近五分之一。在这个总数中，规定直接用于准备新的世界大战和侵朝战争的费用（包括用来武装各仆从国家的所谓“共同安全”经费在内）是六百五十一亿美元，比一年前增加了约三分之一。这笔费用占总预算的百分之七十三，如果再加上其他与军事目的有关的开支，总数共占全部预算的百分之八十五。
    杜鲁门在如此疯狂增加军费同时，进一步“大大地削减”各项非军事性的支出，比两年前共计减少了百分之九。其中削减得特别多的是直接关系人民福利的费用，例如：公共卫生事业费用将减少百分之十，农事救济费将减少百分之七十二。虽然美国去年曾因水利失修而发生了近百年来最大的水灾，杜鲁门却把防洪工程费用继续削减到只有一九五○年的一半。虽然大家还记得不久以前美国发生了煤矿爆炸的大惨案，杜鲁门却只准备拨出微不足道的四百万美元用于改善矿坑安全设备。
    杜鲁门的咨文说明美国经济的迅速军事化。美国目前主要的军事费用的开支速度已达年率四百五十亿美元，为朝鲜战争爆发前一年度军费开支的二点六倍。按照杜鲁门的算法，备战费用在国家总生产中所占的比重，已增加为那时的二又三分之一倍，计划到今年年底要扩增到三倍。在主要的工业部门如金属和建筑工业中，军事生产目前已占总生产量的四分之一，并将继续增大到三分之一以上。
    杜鲁门的咨文也说明美国民用工业的生产还要进一步削减。虽然去年一年中，美国军事生产约提高了三倍，但民用品生产的巨大缩减使美国工业生产的总量仍然停留在一年前的水平上。杜鲁门宣布，一九五二年内还要“减少急需物资在制造许多和平时期物品方面之使用”，因此，“某些规模较小的生产企业将遇到严重的问题”。这种形势已造成美国失业的增加。杜鲁门在咨文中透露，虽然美国所谓“国防或支援国防的工业”的雇工人数，在一九五一年底时比朝鲜战争以前增加了一又四分之三倍，计增加三百五十万人。但是同时期的就业总人数不仅未有增加，反而减少了好几十万。其中特别是农业就业人数，竟比一年前减少了四十五万。
    杜鲁门承认，由于政府的军事化计划，国家财政上已产生了“大量赤字”，“消费品的生产量降低了”，国家财力的很大部分“不能用于提高生活水准”。但是杜鲁门却仍然要求美国人民继续“牺牲”。他要求再增加赋税五十亿美元，把军国主义的“国防生产法”再延长两年，实施严格的工资管制。他公然告诉美国人民必须“忍受一些不便与困难”，要美国纳税人担起“沉重的担子”。
    像在他的国情咨文中所作的一样，杜鲁门在他的经济咨文中又呼吁不要“对我们自己的能力丧失信心或抱失败主义”。但他不能不承认他的这种军事化计划将给美国经济带来更大的灾难。他承认美国经济将遇到“难关”。他说：“纵使照我的建议增加税收，估计今年仍将有巨大的赤字，明年的赤字将会更大。这个赤字，加上经济在其他方面受到的压力，将会增加通货膨胀的危险。”对于杜鲁门说来，最大的危险是这种经济军事化的政策必将引起美国经济和政治的严重危机。这一点，杜鲁门自己都无法掩饰其内心的不安。他甚至不得不承认，疯狂的扩张军备运动会“耗竭我们的经济，减弱公众对一个必须长时期进行的计划的支持”。
    【新华社三十一日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统杜鲁门向国会提出的八百五十四亿美元的巨额预算，在美国统治集团内部引起了极大的混乱。尽管美国资产阶级的议员与报纸都毫无例外地支持杜鲁门政府扩军备战的国策，但是他们中间却有很大一部分害怕像杜鲁门这样毫无节制地蛮干下去，会在美国迅速引起财政崩溃的危机，从而引起美国人民不可遏制的反抗。
    在一月二十一日杜鲁门提出预算咨文的当天，合众社特地发出了一条消息为杜鲁门的预算做了一番“注解”，说明美国实际上无力支付杜鲁门所要求的开支。合众社的这条消息劈头就说：“这样多的钱是没有的”。因为，“美国所发行的钞票每人平均为一百八十元左右，而按照预算每人要有五百四十七元七角二分。美国所发行的现钞总额约为二百八十亿元，即使把财政部用来支持通货的款项和黄金通通算进去，一共也只有五百亿元左右。”
    虽然国家支出总额并不能完全以国家通货总额来计量，但是合众社的统计却清楚地说明了杜鲁门所提出的预算已大到如何荒谬的地步。在这种情况下，据合众社透露：“国会的共和党领袖指责杜鲁门提出的预算简直是‘在发疯’，某些有势力的民主党人也随声要求削减预算。”“他们甚至在总统还没有正式宣布其预算数字以前，就在国会中纷纷提出了这项要求。”
    共和党议员竭力攻击杜鲁门的民主党政府挥霍无度，耗损了国家财力。他们发表声明说：“杜鲁门对任何问题的唯一答复就是花钱，花更多的钱。”民主党的议员则更害怕杜鲁门要求的巨额增税会引起选民的反感。甚至一贯为政府政策辩护的参议员康纳利也说：“我国人民再也不能担负更多的赋税了，我对于赋税一般的增加将投反对票。”“纽约时报”在评论杜鲁门主张以大量增税来避免通货膨胀的论据时说：“全国人民负担了过度的重税，但税收本质上是否有作为抵制通货膨胀的武器的价值却值得怀疑。一方面继续增税本身就带来通货膨胀的因素，另一方面联邦赤字增加，这是应该慎重加以考虑的。”旧金山“纪事报”也认为政府开支应当在不妨碍实行政府政策的条件下予以削减。该报说：“我们对杜鲁门先生的声明没有意见。……但是我们从来没有认为这个预算是不能降低的。”
    尽管有这样各种要求削减预算的呼声，美国统治集团在坚持现行扩军备战政策的情况下，实际上却很难逃得开他们所害怕的财政崩溃。合众社华盛顿二十二日电就说：“国会两党议员都立誓要从杜鲁门总统所提出的八百五十四亿和平时期最高预算中削减五十亿元，然而一些议员私下承认：口头上答应要削减预算是容易的，做起来就比较麻烦了。”这种矛盾突出地表现了美帝国主义的根本矛盾，即侵略目标很大而本身的侵略力量却很小。这种矛盾显然将在美国国会将来讨论预算问题时进一步地暴露出来。旧金山“纪事报”就已经预言：“预算问题将引起很多争执。”
