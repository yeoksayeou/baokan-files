Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th. After the crimes of Li Yinting, the manager of the Hankou Fuhua Electric Motor and Absorbent Cotton Factory, a criminal who harmed the Chinese People's Volunteers, were exposed, soldiers, workers, government employees, students, and citizens in Wuhan have written letters to the Hankou Changjiang Daily and New Wuhan Daily for days, expressing their boundless anger.

The Changjiang Daily received 117 letters of accusation from readers in the three days from the 12th to the 14th.

Luo Yulin, a wounded veteran of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning home for recuperation, wrote in his letter: "Last February, I was wounded and bandaged with several emergency kits that were small and dirty. After two days, the wound became infected and festered particularly badly. My upper body became disabled unnecessarily. From this incident, we can see how mad the reactionary nature of unscrupulous merchants, who seek only profit, harm others, and engage in speculation, has developed!" The entire workforce of the Eighth Squad of the Fourteenth Brigade of the Third Transportation Station in Hanyang wrote in their letter: "Our workers rack their brains day and night to find ways to increase production and practice thrift to support the most beloved people. But the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting uses such despicable and shameless means, he is simply a wolf in human skin." People from all walks of life pointed out in their letters that the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting's planned sabotage against the Chinese People's Volunteers has made him a traitor to the people of the motherland and a public enemy endangering the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and they demanded that the People's Government severely punish him according to the law.

From Li Yinting's crimes, people from all walks of life have further recognized the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the country and the people and its despicable and malicious schemes, and they have become more determined to repel the bourgeoisie's attack. Old worker He Qingming said: "In the past, I did not have enough understanding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, thinking it was not my business. Now I must actively participate in the movement and will not give up until these unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements are completely cleaned up!"

    武汉市各界人民
    要求严惩奸商李寅廷
    【新华社汉口十六日电】暗害中国人民志愿军的罪犯、汉口福华电机药棉厂经理李寅廷的罪行被揭发后，连日来，武汉市的战士、工人、机关工作者、学生、市民纷纷写信给汉口长江日报、新武汉报，表示无比的愤怒。
    长江日报在十二日到十四日三天中，就接到读者的控诉信件一百一十七件。
    中国人民志愿军归国休养的伤员罗玉林在信中写道：“去年二月，我负了伤，扎上了几个又小又脏的救急包，过了两天，伤口便化了脓，而且化得特别厉害，我的上半身就这样不该残废而残废了。从这件事件中，可以看出奸商们唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的反动本质，已发展到多么丧心病狂的程度！”汉阳第三搬运站十四大队八小队全体工人的信中说：“我们工人日日夜夜动脑筋，找窍门，增产节约，支持最可爱的人。而奸商李寅廷却使用这样卑劣无耻的手段，简直是披着人皮的豺狼。”各界人民在信中都指出：奸商李寅廷有计划地暗害中国人民志愿军，已成为祖国人民的叛徒，危害抗美援朝事业的公敌，要求人民政府依法严办。
    各界人民从李寅廷的罪行中，进一步认识了资产阶级向国家人民的猖狂进攻和卑鄙恶毒的诡计，更加坚定了他们打退资产阶级进攻的斗志。老工人贺清明说：“以前，我对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动认识不够，以为事不关己。现在要积极参加运动，不把这些奸商、贪污分子搞干净誓不罢休！”
