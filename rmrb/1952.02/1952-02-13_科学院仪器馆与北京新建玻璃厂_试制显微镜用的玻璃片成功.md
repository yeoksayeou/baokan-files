    Chinese Academy of Sciences Instrument Hall and Beijing New Glass Factory
    Successfully Trial-Produce Microscope Slides
    Editor: In the past, our country could not produce microscope slides ourselves, and we purchased them from abroad every year, consuming a large quantity. It is estimated that due to the increasing development of medical and health work, this year's demand will exceed one million pieces. The Ministry of Health believes that this kind of bulk consumable should be manufactured domestically, so it asked the Chinese Academy of Sciences to solve this problem. After accepting this task, the Preparatory Office of the Instrument Hall of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing New Glass Factory jointly carried out this work. Sun Ruqiang, a worker at the factory, used his brains and worked actively. Under the technical guidance of the comrades from the Preparatory Office of the Instrument Hall, he successfully experimented in less than a month. The products have been tried out by various parties and are very satisfactory. The factory is now renovating its kilns in preparation for mass production.

    科学院仪器馆与北京新建玻璃厂
    试制显微镜用的玻璃片成功
    编辑同志：过去我国不能自制显微镜上用的玻璃片，每年从国外购买，消耗的数量很大。据估计，由于医药卫生工作的日益开展，今年的需要量将超过百万片。中央卫生部认为这种大宗消耗品，应在国内自行制造，因此提请中国科学院解决这个问题。中国科学院仪器馆筹备处接受这个任务后，便和北京新建玻璃厂共同进行这项工作。该厂工人孙汝强开动脑筋，积极努力，在仪器馆筹备处同志们的技术指导下，不到一月便试验成功了。出品经各方试用，都很满意，现该厂正改建窑炉，准备大量生产。中国科学院办公厅调查研究室劳动模范邵炳南
