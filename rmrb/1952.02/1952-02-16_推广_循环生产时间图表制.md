    Promote the "Cyclical Production Time Chart System"
    Vigorously promoting Ma Liu-hai's multi-drift cyclic tunneling method to improve tunneling efficiency is crucial for all coal mines across the country to complete this year's production tasks. While promoting Ma Liu-hai's multi-drift cyclic tunneling method, implementing the cyclical production time chart system is of even greater significance for improving labor productivity and comprehensively reforming the coal mine production enterprise. The cyclical production time chart system is a scientific system that must be adopted when implementing mechanized new coal mining methods. It can ensure the normal progress of cyclical operations.
    The experience of Datong Coal Mine's No. 6 well shows that to promote the cyclical production time chart system, we must first overcome the conservative thinking of leading cadres.
    One form of conservative thinking is being satisfied with the production achievements after adopting mechanized new coal mining methods, and being satisfied with the workers' existing production enthusiasm. Cadres with this kind of complacent thinking believe that the coal mines they manage are already "complete and flawless," and therefore, implementing the cyclical production time chart system is no longer necessary. These cadres should recognize that implementing mechanized new coal mining methods is only the beginning of a comprehensive reform of coal mine production. It is necessary to do a good job in roof management on the basis of adopting new coal mining methods, ensure the safe operation of machinery, constantly educate miners, organize them to study, and use the cyclical production time chart system to manage and guide production, in order to continuously exert the potential capabilities of labor and machinery, and continuously improve production efficiency.
    Another form of conservative thinking is emphasizing difficult objective conditions and not implementing the advanced chart system. When they hear about the successful implementation of the cyclical production time chart system in Datong Coal Mine, they say: "Datong has good coal seams, good equipment, and many technicians." This idea that advanced experience is only applicable to coal mines with better objective conditions, and not applicable to coal mines with poor objective conditions, essentially denies the role of advanced production experience. People with this kind of thinking should recognize that the cyclical production time chart is determined based on specific technical specifications and the production experience of miners. Although the specific conditions of each mine are different, as long as the leading cadres have a full understanding of advanced production experience and mobilize the workers to come up with ideas, advanced experience can definitely be promoted. Moreover, only by implementing advanced production methods can relatively backward coal mines be transformed into advanced coal mines.

### 推广“循环生产时间图表制”

    推广“循环生产时间图表制”
    大力推广马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法，以提高掘进效率，是全国各煤矿完成今年生产任务的关键。在推广马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法的同时，实行循环生产时间表工作制，对于提高劳动生产率、全面改革煤矿生产事业，有着更重大的意义。循环生产时间图表制，是实行机械化新采煤法时必须采用的一种科学的制度。它可以保证循环作业的正常进行。
    大同煤矿六号井的经验说明了，要推广循环生产时间图表制，首先必须克服领导干部的保守思想。
    一种保守思想是满足于采用机械化新采煤法以后的生产成绩，满足于工人现有的生产热情。有这种自满思想的干部，认为自己管理的煤矿已“完整无缺”了，因此，实行循环生产时间图表制已没有什么必要了。这些干部应该认识，实行机械化新采煤法，只是全面改革煤矿生产的开端。必须在采用新采煤法的基础上，做好顶板管理工作，保证机械安全运转，经常地教育矿工，组织他们学习，用循环生产时间图表制管理和指导生产，才能够不断地发挥劳动的和机械的潜在能力，才能够不断地提高生产效率。
    还有一种保守思想，就是强调客观条件困难而不实行先进的图表制。当他们听到大同煤矿实行循环生产图表制成功以后，说：“大同的煤层好，设备好，技术人员多。”这种认为先进经验只适用于客观条件较好的煤矿，而不适用于客观条件较差的煤矿的思想，实质上就是否认先进生产经验的作用。有这种思想的人应该认识：循环生产时间图表是根据具体的技术标定和矿工的生产经验来确定的，各矿具体情况虽不一样，但只要领导干部对先进生产经验有充分的认识，发动职工来想办法，先进经验一定可以推广。而且也只有实行先进的生产方法，才可以把比较落后的煤矿变为先进的煤矿。
