Xinhua News Agency: Railway workers in various places warmly commemorated the 29th anniversary of the "February 7th" Struggle. On the 7th, representatives from all walks of life in Zhengzhou City and railway workers and citizens, about 30,000 people, held a meeting at Erqi Square, where the Northern Warlords killed Si Wende, the leader of the Zhengzhou railway workers after the failure of the "February 7th" strike, to publicly try Zhang Shirong, the murderer who killed martyr Si Wende and sabotaged the "February 7th" General Strike, and to offer public sacrifices to Si Wende and another martyred strike leader, Wang Shengyou. Liang Yongfu, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China, Li Zhengang, vice chairman of the Tianjin District Committee, and Li Bin, vice chairman of the Beijing Branch Committee (all veteran workers of the February 7th strike), also participated in the public trial and public sacrifice. At the meeting, Liang Yongfu, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China, filed a public prosecution. Si Li Shi, the wife of martyr Si Wende, and Zheng Guojun, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike, took the stage one after another to accuse Zhang of his crimes, demanding that the People's Government severely punish Zhang according to law and avenge the martyrs of the "February 7th" strike. The Zhengzhou Municipal People's Court accepted their request and submitted it to the Henan Provincial People's Government for approval, sentencing Zhang to death and executing him on the spot. A public sacrifice was then held, presided over by Song Zhihe, the mayor of Zhengzhou.
    The "February 7th" veterans, family members of the "February 7th" martyrs and worker representatives of Jiang'an area, the source of the "February 7th" General Strike of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, held a commemorative meeting on the morning of the 7th. At the meeting, Liu Yi, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Hankou Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Hankou Branch, made a report. He called on all railway employees to show the heroic spirit of the "February 7th" struggle, break through their personal feelings and boldly report corrupt elements, smash the bourgeoisie's attack, and the veteran workers of the "February 7th" General Strike should become the main force in the anti-corruption struggle. Lin Maoxiang, a representative of the veteran workers of the "February 7th" strike, said at the meeting: He guaranteed to take the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement as the overriding task, mobilize everyone to actively report corrupt elements, and never stop until the erosion of the bourgeoisie is eradicated.
