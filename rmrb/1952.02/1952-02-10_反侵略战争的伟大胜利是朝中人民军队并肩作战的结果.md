The Korean people, filled with victorious confidence as they welcome the fourth anniversary of the founding of their armed forces – the Korean People's Army – while warmly congratulating the Korean People's Army's combat strength and its victorious organizers and leaders, the Korean Workers' Party and our leader General Kim Il-sung, extend heartfelt thanks and congratulations to the great Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and all the Chinese people.

The Korean people know that the great victory they have achieved in the just war against American imperialist aggression is the result of the close, shoulder-to-shoulder combat of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The Korean people, together with their true sons and daughters – the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army – highly praise the special contributions and achievements made by the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people – the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army – on the Korean battlefield.

The arch-criminal of world imperialism, the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people – the American imperialists – instigated their lackey, the Li Seung-man bandit gang, to launch a war of aggression on June 25, 1950. The Korean People's Army, in order to defend its beloved motherland, had no choice but to take up righteous arms and launch a counter-attack. In the first stage of the war, the Korean People's Army not only quickly repelled the enemy's offensive, but also, within a month of starting the counter-offensive, advanced to the distant southern coast and the Nakdong River area, crushing at one stroke the so-called "Northern Expedition Plan" painstakingly planned by the American imperialists for their lackey, the Li Seung-man bandit gang.

When the American aggressors saw the failure of their lackey's offensive, they drove several divisions of American troops stationed in Japan to Korea, attempting to stop the People's Army's counter-offensive. When this attempt also failed, they mobilized all their forces in the Pacific region and forcibly landed at Incheon.

At that time, the Korean People's Army, facing an enemy land, sea, and air force that was numerically superior, had to make a temporary retreat. During the extremely difficult and serious period of retreat, the Korean People's Army broke through the enemy's encirclement, preserved its main force, reorganized and strengthened its ranks, cultivated reserves, and prepared for a counter-offensive. Just when the Korean people were in this critical situation, the fraternal Chinese people organized volunteer troops to come to the Korean battlefield. The powerful armed assistance of the Chinese people not only infinitely encouraged the Korean people's confidence in victory, but also became a huge force to annihilate and expel the American armed interventionists who had invaded our country.

Shortly after the start of the counter-offensive, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting closely side by side, encircled and annihilated the enemy forces that had invaded the Cheongcheon River and attempted to swallow up Korea in one fell swoop, recovered the area north of the 38th parallel, and drove the enemy south of the 38th parallel.

The Korean and Chinese People's Armies, fighting closely side by side, through five battles, severely struck the enemy, shattered the armed interventionists' vain attempt to occupy northern Korea, and effectively carried out blocking and counter-attack battles under the correct strategic policy of "annihilating the enemy's effective strength".

The major losses and defeats suffered by the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield were unprecedented in American history. The American aggressor troops, who claimed to be the most "powerful" and "unbeatable," were completely exposed as outwardly strong but inwardly weak under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. The Korean People's Army has been forged into a powerful force in the course of fierce battles, and in actual combat, it has learned the tactics of assessing the enemy and then defeating them according to modern military science, learned offensive warfare, defensive warfare, and mountain warfare, and can effectively organize the coordinated operations of various arms in various battles. Our army is already good at using various weapons, and our commanders are also familiar with the art of command. In the course of combat, our People's Army has not only improved its military skills and combat effectiveness, but also accumulated a great deal of valuable combat experience.

Thanks to the vigorous political work carried out by the Korean Workers' Party in the People's Army units, the political quality of our officers and soldiers has been greatly improved, and their discipline and organization have also been greatly strengthened.

The high degree of heroism and patriotism displayed by our People's Army in the battles to defend the independence and freedom of the motherland and resist American imperialist aggression has been respected and loved by the Korean people and praised by the people of the world. Today, the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, together with their close comrades-in-arms – the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army – are continuing to inflict heavy blows on the American aggressors and expanding the fruits of victory.

The combat strength of our People's Army has been further strengthened thanks to the strong support of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet people.

The great Soviet people, the liberators, helpers, and close friends of the Korean people, have given us tremendous help and support for our victory, exposed and denounced the American imperialists' crimes of aggression against our country, and are fighting for a peaceful solution to the Korean problem.

The anti-American and aid-Korea movement launched by the 475 million Chinese brothers and sisters led by the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong has further strengthened our strength. The fraternal unity of the Chinese and Korean people, who have forged a deep friendship in the long revolutionary struggle, is even closer, and no sinister schemes of the aggressors can destroy this great united force.

The support and assistance given to the Korean people by the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all fraternal countries such as Hungary, Romania, Poland, Mongolia, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and all peace-loving people of the world is a powerful guarantee for our final victory.

The fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army has made special contributions in the struggle against the American aggressors. They helped us in the most difficult times for our people, using their own blood to resist the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people – the American aggressors – enabling us to achieve even more brilliant victories.

The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army regard the struggle to aid the Korean people as the same struggle as defending the freedom and happiness of their own compatriots, and they share weal and woe and fight shoulder to shoulder with the officers and soldiers of our Korean People's Army. Their armed assistance to us is the invincible force that we must have to resist the armed aggression of the American imperialists, and it is a reliable guarantee for our victory.

The Korean people will never forget the outstanding heroism and internationalism displayed by the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield, and their glorious achievements will be forever recorded in the history of our country. Under the strong blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, the combat strength of the American armed aggressors has been greatly weakened, and the so-called "technical superiority" that the aggressors have trumpeted has gone bankrupt. Contrary to the enemy's estimates, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are increasingly armed with excellent modern technology and equipment.

Today, Ridgway, the successor of the defeated MacArthur, in order to realize the delusions that his predecessors did not realize, continues to drive his mercenaries to constantly attack our army despite heavy losses. However, the American imperialists' mercenaries are unwilling to sell their lives for this meaningless war for them.

Although the American armed aggressors have been severely hit by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, they have not learned the lessons they should have learned from here, and continue to delay the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to seize the opportunity to launch new adventurous offensives. But this will not work. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies are fully prepared to smash any conspiracy of the aggressors. If the American aggressors dare to undermine the armistice negotiations and even expand their war of aggression, then the Korean and Chinese People's Armies will strike the enemy with redoubled force and wipe them out on the Korean territory.

    反侵略战争的伟大胜利是朝中人民军队并肩作战的结果
    朝鲜人民军总政治局局长  金载郁
    满怀胜利信心迎接自己的武装力量——朝鲜人民军——建军四周年的朝鲜人民，在向朝鲜人民军的战斗力量和胜利的组织者和领导者朝鲜劳动党和我们的领袖金日成将军热烈祝贺的同时，要向伟大的中国共产党和中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东主席、英雄的中国人民志愿军和全中国人民表示由衷的感谢与祝贺。
    朝鲜人民知道，他们在反抗美帝国主义侵略的正义战争中所取得的伟大胜利，是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军紧密地并肩作战的结果。朝鲜人民和自己的真正儿女——朝鲜人民军官兵一起，高度地赞扬着中国人民的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员在朝鲜战场上所建立的特殊功勋和业绩。
    世界帝国主义的元凶、朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义者，在一九五○年六月二十五日，唆使其走狗李承晚匪帮发动了侵略战争。朝鲜人民军为了保卫可爱的祖国，不得已而手执正义武器举行了反攻。在战争的第一个阶段，朝鲜人民军不但迅速地击退了敌人的进攻，而且在开始反攻后仅一个月的时间内，就挺进到遥远的南海岸和洛东江地区，一举粉碎了美帝国主义者费尽心机为其走狗李承晚匪帮所策划的所谓“北伐计划”。
    当美国侵略者看到它的走狗的进攻失败以后，就把美国驻扎在日本的数师兵力驱使到朝鲜，企图阻止人民军的反攻。而当它这一企图又遭破产后，它就动员了它在太平洋地区的全部兵力在仁川强行登陆了。
    那时，朝鲜人民军面对着数量上占优势的敌陆、海、空军，不得不作暂时的退却。在极端艰苦而严重的退却时期，朝鲜人民军突破敌人的包围，保存了自己的主力，整编和加强了队伍，培养了后备军，进行了反攻的准备。正当朝鲜人民处于这种严重局势的时候，兄弟般的中国人民组织了志愿部队来到朝鲜战场了。中国人民的强大的武装援助，不仅无限地鼓舞了朝鲜人民的胜利信心，而且成了歼灭和驱逐侵入我国的美国武装干涉者的巨大力量。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在开始反攻后不久，就围歼了曾侵犯到清川江企图一举吞并朝鲜的敌军，收复了三八线以北地区，把敌人赶到三八线以南去了。
    朝中人民军队紧密地并肩作战，经过五次战役，沉重地打击了敌人，粉碎了武装干涉者侵占朝鲜北部的狂妄企图，并在“歼灭敌人有生力量”的正确战略方针下，有效地进行了阻击战和反击战。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭到的重大损失和惨败，是美国历史上未曾有过的事。自称最“强大”而“不败”的美国侵略军，在朝中人民军队的沉重打击下，完全暴露了它的外强中干。朝鲜人民军在激烈的战斗过程中锻炼成了强大的部队，在实际的战斗中学会了按照现代的军事科学来估计敌人进而战胜敌人的战术，学会了进攻战、防御战和山岳战，并能在各种战斗中有效地组织各兵种的协同作战。我们的军队已经善于使用各种武器了，我们的指挥官也熟悉了指挥艺术。我们人民军在战斗过程中不但提高了自己的军事技术和战斗力，而且积累了许多宝贵的战斗经验。
    由于朝鲜劳动党在人民军部队内大力进行了政治工作，我们官兵的政治素质有了很大的提高，纪律性和组织性也大大地加强了。
    我们人民军在保卫祖国独立和自由、反抗美帝国主义侵略的战斗中所发挥的高度的英雄主义和爱国主义精神，受到了朝鲜人民的尊敬与爱护和全世界人民的赞扬。今天，朝鲜人民军官兵正和自己的亲密战友——中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员一起，继续予美国侵略者以沉重的打击而扩大着胜利的战果。
    我们人民军的战斗力量由于以伟大的苏联人民为首的世界和平民主阵营强有力的支援而进一步加强了。
    朝鲜人民的解放者、援助者和亲密的朋友——伟大的苏联人民，为了我们的胜利给了我们莫大的帮助和声援，并揭露和痛斥了美帝国主义侵略我国的罪行，为争取和平解决朝鲜问题进行着斗争。
    伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席所领导的四万万七千五百万中国兄弟们所展开的抗美援朝运动，更加壮大了我们的力量。在长期的革命斗争中结成深厚友谊的朝中两国人民兄弟般的团结更加紧密了，侵略者的任何穷凶极恶的阴谋诡计也摧毁不了这一伟大的团结力量。
    伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国及匈牙利、罗马尼亚、波兰、蒙古、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国等所有兄弟国家人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民所给予朝鲜人民的支持和援助，是我们争取最后胜利的有力保障。
    兄弟般的中国人民志愿军在反抗美国侵略者的斗争中建立了特殊的功勋。他们在我国人民最困难的时期帮助了我们，用他们自己的鲜血抗击着朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美国侵略者，使我们取得了更加光辉的胜利。
    中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员把援助朝鲜人民的斗争看成和保卫自己同胞兄弟的自由幸福的斗争一样，和我们朝鲜人民军官兵同甘共苦并肩战斗。他们给予我们的武装援助是我们反抗美帝国主义武装侵略者的必胜不败的力量，是我们取得胜利的可靠保障。
    朝鲜人民永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员在朝鲜战场上所发挥的卓越的英雄主义和国际主义精神，他们的辉煌功绩将永垂于我国的史册。在朝中人民军队的坚强打击下，美国武装侵略者的战斗力已被大大削弱，侵略者大肆吹嘘的所谓“技术优势”已经破产了。和敌人的估计恰恰相反，朝中人民军队日益以优良的现代化技术和装备武装起来了。
    今天，败将麦克阿瑟的后继者——李奇微，为实现其前辈所没有实现的妄想，仍不顾惨重损失，驱使其雇佣兵向我军不断进犯。但是，美帝国主义的雇佣兵已不愿意为这种对他们毫无意义的战争而卖命了。
    美国武装侵略者虽然遭到了朝中人民军队的沉重打击，但它还没有从这里取得应有的教训，继续拖延着朝鲜停战谈判，企图伺机发动新的冒险进攻。但这是行不通的，朝中人民军队已经有了粉碎侵略者的任何阴谋的充分准备。如果美国侵略者胆敢破坏停战谈判，竟然扩大其侵略战争的话，那么，朝中人民军队将以加倍的力量打击敌人，在朝鲜疆土上把敌人消灭干净。
