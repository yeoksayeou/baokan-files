Comrades!

    I now announce the opening of our rally celebrating the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Over the past two years, everyone has seen the significant role that this Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, with its great historical significance, has played in promoting the construction of new China and in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. It can be asserted that in the future, it will have an even more profound and beneficial impact on the people of China and the Soviet Union, and on the people of the world. The unity and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, as solidified by this treaty, has become even more developed and consolidated. The prestige of the peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, has been further enhanced among the working people and oppressed and enslaved nations around the world. Conversely, the contradictions and disputes within the imperialist bloc of aggression have become even more serious.

    However, the dying imperialists will never learn any lessons from failure. Recently, in addition to intensifying the rearmament of Japan, continuing the war of aggression against Korea, and occupying Taiwan, U.S. imperialism has also forced the reactionary Japanese government to conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang it protects and who fled to Taiwan. It has also instructed the Chiang gang's representative in the United Nations to propose a so-called "accusation against the Soviet Union" case, and has even directed and transported remnant troops of the Chiang gang to assemble in the area bordering China and Burma, plotting to invade our border. Comrades! We can see that U.S. imperialism never forgets to invade our People's Republic of China. However, in the face of the Chinese people who have already stood up, coupled with the consolidation and development of the great Sino-Soviet alliance, any aggressive schemes of the enemy will be completely crushed.

    Here, together with all the Chinese people, I respectfully wish Marshal Stalin good health, and wish the Soviet people greater victories in the construction of a communist society and in the struggle for lasting world peace.

    I respectfully wish Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, good health, and wish our people great victories in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and in various domestic reforms and construction work!

    Long live the great, unbreakable friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!

### 中苏友协总会刘少奇会长的讲话

    中苏友协总会刘少奇会长的讲话同志们！
    现在我宣布，我们庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年的大会开始了。两年来，人们都会看到这个具有伟大历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约对于促进新中国的建设，对于保卫远东与世界的和平已经发生了何等重大的作用。可以断言，在今后，它对中苏两国人民和全世界人民将要发生更加深远和有利的影响。为这个条约所固定下来的中苏两国人民的团结与合作是更加发展和巩固了。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营在全世界劳动人民和被压迫被奴役的民族中间的威信是更加提高了。相反，帝国主义的侵略阵营内部的矛盾和争吵则更加严重了。
    但是，垂死的帝国主义者是永远不会从失败中领取任何教训的。最近美帝国主义除了加紧重新武装日本、继续侵朝战争和侵占台湾之外，又迫使日本的反动政府向它所保护和逃亡在台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮缔结所谓“双边条约”，又指使蒋匪在联合国中的代表提出所谓“控苏案”，更指挥和运送蒋匪残余军队在我国和缅甸接界的地方集结，图谋向我国边境进犯。同志们！我们可以看见美帝国主义是念念不忘侵略我们中华人民共和国的。但是，在已经站起来了的中国人民前面，加上伟大的中苏友好同盟的巩固与发展，敌人的任何侵略阴谋一定会彻底地被粉碎的。
    我在此和全中国人民一起敬祝斯大林大元帅健康，敬祝苏联人民在建设共产主义社会的工程中，在争取世界持久和平的斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    敬祝中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席健康，敬祝我国人民在抗美援朝和国内各种改革和建设工作中的伟大胜利！
    中苏两国伟大的牢不可破的友好合作万岁！
