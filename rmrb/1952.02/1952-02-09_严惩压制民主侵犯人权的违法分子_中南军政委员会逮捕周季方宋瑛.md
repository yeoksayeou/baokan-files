Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Central-South Military and Political Committee has ordered the arrest of Zhou Jifang, Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs of the Central-South Military and Political Committee and former Deputy Mayor of Wuhan Municipality, and Song Ying, former Deputy Director of the Health Bureau of Wuhan Municipality, for abusing their power to suppress democracy and violate human rights, and will punish them according to law.

During Zhou Jifang's tenure as Deputy Mayor of Wuhan Municipality, a health worker in the city, using the pseudonym "Chen Jie," complained to Chairman Mao about many errors in Song Ying's work as Deputy Director of the Municipal Health Bureau at the time. For example, when Song Ying concurrently served as the Director of the Municipal Hospital, she refused to admit emergency patients from the southward-marching army, resulting in the death of individual patients due to lack of treatment. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party forwarded this complaint letter to the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, instructing the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to be responsible for investigation and handling. When the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed Song Ying to conduct a self-criticism, Zhou Jifang, as a leader, agreed with Song Ying's investigation of the complainant and subsequently protected her. Under this support, Song Ying did not earnestly reflect on her mistakes, but instead summoned Ji Kaifu (member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League), Wang Shouzheng, and Ma Jun, three staff members of the Wuhan Municipal Second Hospital, to the Municipal Health Bureau, and unreasonably coerced them through threats and deception. Afterwards, Ji Kaifu and the other two complained to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party about Song Ying's "violation of human rights and law," which made Song Ying even more resentful. Before this matter was resolved, on April 12th last year, a theft case occurred at the Wuhan Municipal Second Hospital. Because Ji Kaifu took an active attitude in handling the case and suspected Wang Qing, the hospital's supervisor, Song Ying and others falsely accused Ji Kaifu of being a conspirator in the theft. On April 14th, she, in her capacity as "administrative head," forcibly ordered the Fourth Branch of the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest Ji Kaifu. However, after investigation, the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau released Ji Kaifu on the 15th because there was no factual basis. Song Ying was very dissatisfied because she did not achieve her goal of revenge, so she sought help from Zhou Jifang. Zhou Jifang listened to Song Ying's one-sided story, and without investigating or first requesting instructions from the mayor, he arbitrarily ordered the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest Ji Kaifu for the second time. Ji Kaifu was unjustly detained for more than eight months. Later, after a joint investigation of the theft case by more than a dozen agencies, including the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central-South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Supervision Committee of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, it was proven that the case had nothing to do with him, and he was released on December 23rd last year. As for the thief, it was later found to be Wang Qing, the supervisor of the hospital.

Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, and others dared to abuse their power to suppress democracy and violate human rights, which is intolerable by national law. Therefore, the Central-South Military and Political Committee ordered their arrest and prosecution on January 29th, and instructed that other relevant personnel involved in this illegal incident should also be investigated.

After Ji Kaifu was released, he was immediately hospitalized for high blood pressure. Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, made a special trip to the Second Hospital to express his sympathy and encouragement to Ji Kaifu for his consistently active work in the past, hoping that he would continue to work hard in the future. Ji Kaifu expressed his deep gratitude for Vice Chairman Deng's sympathy and said that he was determined to work hard under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government.

    严惩压制民主侵犯人权的违法分子
    中南军政委员会逮捕周季方宋瑛
    【新华社七日讯】中南军政委员会下令逮捕利用职权压制民主侵犯人权的违法分子中南军政委员会民政部副部长、前任武汉市人民政府副市长周季方和前任武汉市人民政府卫生局副局长宋瑛，并将依法惩办。
    周季方任武汉市人民政府副市长期间，曾有该市卫生工作人员化名“陈颉”向毛主席控告当时市卫生局副局长宋瑛在工作上的许多错误。如宋瑛兼任市立医院院长时，曾拒收南下大军急症病员，以致个别病员不及医治而死。中国共产党中央便将这封控告信转给中共武汉市委员会，指示中共武汉市委员会负责检查和处理。当中共武汉市委员会指令宋瑛进行检讨时，身为领导人的周季方竟同意宋瑛追查控告人，事后并予以庇护。宋瑛在这种支持下，不切实反省错误，反而将武汉市立第二医院工作人员纪凯夫（中国新民主主义青年团团员）、王守正、马骏三人叫到市卫生局，用威胁欺诈的手段进行无理追逼。事后纪凯夫等三人曾向中共武汉市委员会纪律检查委员会控告宋瑛等“违犯人权和法纪”，宋瑛因此更怀恨在心。当这件事还没有结束，在去年四月十二日，武汉市立第二医院发生了盗款案，由于纪凯夫对此案的处理态度积极并对该院监委王清有所怀疑，宋瑛等即据此诬纪凯夫为盗款的阴谋者。四月十四日，她就以“行政负责人”的身份强令武汉市人民政府公安局第四分局将纪凯夫逮捕。但公安局第四分局经调查后因无事实根据，十五日即将纪凯夫释放。宋瑛因没有达到报复的目的，非常不满，便求助于周季方。周季方偏听宋瑛一面之词，既不调查又不先行请示市长，竟擅自下令给武汉市公安总局将纪凯夫第二次逮捕。纪凯夫一直被无辜扣押了八个多月，后经中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会、中南军政委员会人民监察委员会等十几个机关联合对盗款案进行调查，证明案件与他确实无关后才在去年十二月二十三日被释放。至于盗款者，后查明即为该院监委王清。
    周季方、宋瑛等胆敢利用职权压制民主侵犯人权的横暴行为，已为国法所不容。因此，中南军政委员会就在一月二十九日下令予以逮捕法办，并指令对于这一违法事件的其他有关人员亦予以查究。
    纪凯夫被释放后，因血压过高，旋即住院治疗。中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢特去第二医院慰问，并对纪凯夫过去一贯的积极工作加以鼓励，希望他今后仍应努力工作。纪凯夫对邓副主席的慰问深表感谢，并表示决心在党和人民政府的领导下努力工作。
