The Shangqiu Prefecture Cotton Planting Guidance Area in Henan Province convened a symposium of forty-four cotton farmer representatives from five counties, including Minquan, Zhecheng, and Suixian, in Shangqiu Prefecture to discuss Qu Yaoli's high-yield cotton planting techniques and experience. Li Lianxue, a special-class cotton planting model of the prefecture who had personally visited Qu Yaoli in Jie County, Shanxi, gave a report, followed by a discussion. The discussion concluded that, except for the pruning method of leaving a few woody branches on each cotton plant to release nutrients, the other experiences could be adopted in Shangqiu Prefecture. They particularly proposed to learn from Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience in the following aspects: (1) Learn Qu Yaoli's "moisture preservation and drought prevention" methods. Everyone believes that Shangqiu is prone to drought in spring, and only by learning "moisture preservation and drought prevention" methods can timely sowing be ensured.

    (2) Learn Qu Yaoli's method of applying more fertilizer. The representatives realized that their low cotton yields were due to insufficient manure application. In 1952, they will ensure that at least one more cart of base fertilizer (approximately 1,000 jin) is applied per mu. (3) Learn Qu Yaoli's dense planting method. The representatives first examined why their cotton yields were low. Everyone believed that their cotton plants averaged more than thirty bolls each, but the highest yield per mu did not exceed three hundred jin. Looking at Qu Yaoli's cotton, each plant averaged only about twenty bolls, but he was able to harvest 912 jin of seed cotton per mu. Everyone realized that this was mainly due to sparse planting, so they were determined to learn Qu Yaoli's dense planting method. Zhao Qingyan, a representative from Minquan County, will go back to promote Qu Yaoli's dense planting method and ensure that at least 1,400 cotton plants are planted per mu in the county in 1952. (Editor's note: Planting 1,400 plants per mu is still sparse; it should be denser.) He himself will experiment with planting 2,600 plants per mu. Wang Gongshi, a representative from Guanyintang District, wants to plant 3,000 plants per mu. (4) Learn Qu Yaoli's rational irrigation methods. Many representatives expressed their intention to dig wells for irrigation when they return. (Huang Dian)

    商邱专区棉农代表座谈
    结合当地各种具体情况
    学习曲耀离的先进经验
    河南省商邱专区植棉指导区，曾召集商邱专区民权、柘城、睢县等五个县四十四个棉农代表举行座谈会，讨论曲耀离的植棉丰产技术经验。亲自到山西解县访问过曲耀离的专区特等植棉模范李连学作了报告，接着大家就进行讨论。讨论结果，大家认为除每棵棉株留少数木枝发泄养分的整枝法，还需要继续研究外，其他经验在商邱专区都可以采用。他们并特别提出要从下面几点来学习曲耀离的植棉经验：（一）要学习曲耀离的“保墒防旱”办法。大家认为商邱一带春季多旱，只有学习了“保墒防旱”的办法，才能保证作到及时播种。
    （二）要学习曲耀离的多施肥办法。代表们认识到自己棉花收的少是因为上粪太少。一九五二年要保证每亩最少多施一车底粪（约一千斤）。（三）要学习曲耀离的密植办法。代表们首先检查自己种的棉花为什么产量低？大家认为自己种的棉花，每株平均结三十个桃以上的很多，但每亩最高产量没有超过三百斤；再看曲耀离的棉花每株平均不过二十个桃，结果一亩就能收籽棉九百一十二斤。大家认识到这主要是吃了稀植的亏，这样大家就下决心要学习曲耀离的密植办法。民权县代表赵清彦要回去宣传曲耀离的密植办法，保证一九五二年全县棉田每亩至少要植棉一千四百棵。（编者按：每亩种一千四百棵仍然是稀植，还应更密一些。）他自己要试验每亩植二千六百棵。观音堂区代表王公诗要每亩种到三千棵。（四）要学习曲耀离的合理灌溉办法。许多代表都表示回去要打井浇地。（黄电）
