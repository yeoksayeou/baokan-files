Severe epidemics have occurred in the Ding County area of Hebei Province, Chahar, and Hua County, Ye County, and Xinxiang area of Pingyuan Province.

Parts of villages in eight counties of the Ding County area of Hebei Province have experienced an outbreak of influenza, and many patients have died from pneumonia complications. According to statistics from the 16th of this month, in the third district of Qu County alone, the disease had broken out in forty-six villages, affecting two thousand people, of whom one hundred and eighty had died. On the 17th, Ding County discovered 1,625 patients, with 303 deaths. In Wu County, 150 people died in the fifth district alone. In addition, in the fourth district of Xingtang, 1,475 influenza patients were discovered in mid-February, with 110 deaths. After learning about the above situation, the Health Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Ding County Prefectural Commissioner's Office immediately sent special personnel to the affected areas to conduct a comprehensive investigation and understanding of the epidemic's development. By the 20th, it was discovered that influenza outbreaks had occurred in eight counties in the region: Xinle, Qu, Xingtang, Boye, Anping, Ding, Li, and Wuji, affecting 45,266 patients, of whom 1,717 had died from pneumonia complications. In Wuji County alone, there were 13,652 patients, with 486 deaths from pneumonia complications.

Patients' symptoms often start as general cold symptoms: headache, fever, nasal congestion, body aches, and even vomiting. It then develops into severe pneumonia, with symptoms of coughing, bloody sputum, and rapid breathing, leading to death in about two or three days.

The reasons for the outbreak and widespread prevalence of the epidemic, in addition to the lack of rain and snow last winter and this spring, dry weather, and erratic climate changes, include inadequate work by some health administrative departments and local health and medical organizations, underestimation of the severity of the epidemic, or a lack of awareness, which also contributed to the epidemic's development. In light of the above severe situation, the leading organs of Ding County have quickly organized 79 cadres and medical personnel into medical teams, rushing to the affected areas to conduct emergency rescue and prevention.

Currently, influenza has also occurred in other areas of Hebei Province. In Xiaoguanting Village, Julu County, Xingtai area, many farmers contracted influenza around the Spring Festival. From the beginning of January to mid-February of this year, 36 patients have died from pneumonia complications. In the three villages of Beiling, Xizhangfutuo, and Daodi in Fengnan County, Tangshan area, there are also many patients, and seven children have died in the eight days from the 7th to the 14th of this month. This disease has also occurred in six counties in the Shijiazhuang area: Huolu, Jingxing, Zanhuang, Lingshou, Shulu, and Jin. Among them, in Huolu, Jingxing, Zanhuang, and Lingshou counties alone, there are 2,562 patients.

In Chahar Province, measles, plague, smallpox, and other seasonal epidemics are also spreading this spring. According to statistics from fourteen counties, more than 120 people have died. In Guyuan County alone, there are more than 1,000 children with measles. Various livestock epidemics are also occurring in Chahar Province and have begun to spread. In the Chabei area, as many as 2,500 head of livestock have contracted foot-and-mouth disease.

According to an investigation in Hua County, Pingyuan Province, from January 1st to February 12th of this year, infectious diseases such as scarlet fever, measles, tonsillitis, and influenza have occurred in ten districts and 399 villages of the county, affecting 4,306 patients, with 284 deaths. The epidemic has the potential to spread throughout the county, seriously affecting the masses' production enthusiasm and disaster relief efforts. In addition, a large number of infectious diseases are prevalent in the second and fourth districts of Fan County, the fourth and sixth districts of Neihuang, the second and tenth districts of Changyuan, the sixth district of Qingfeng, parts of villages in Puyang, as well as Yancheng, Liaocheng, Heze, and Liangshan counties. More infectious diseases have occurred in Dongming and Chengwu, and sporadic epidemics have occurred in other counties. Many people in Wangning Village, the second district of Ye County, have contracted influenza, and four have died. Infectious diseases have also occurred in the fifth, third, and seventh districts. Epidemics have been found to be prevalent in more than fifty villages in four districts of the county. In the Xinxiang area, due to the warmer climate last winter, epidemics have continued to occur in various places before and after the Spring Festival, and most of them have occurred in disaster areas. Before the Spring Festival, more than 120 people in Datan Village, the first district of Yanjin, contracted measles. After the county organized hospitals and medical unions to treat them, most of them have recovered, but nine people have also died. More than 100 people in the salt factory have contracted influenza, and most of them have been cured. Influenza continues to occur after the Spring Festival. In Yanglin and Shiqiu villages in the third district, the situation is serious because the county and district leading organs discovered it late, and four people have died. Before the Spring Festival, in Shawo, the seventh district of Huixian, more than 20 people were sick. Although they were treated, two children still died. Recently, more than 100 people (mostly children) in Geng Village and other five villages have contracted diphtheria, which is now spreading to Liangmatun, Chuqiao, and other villages in the third district. In addition, meningitis has also occurred in Nanyunmen, the first district. Most of the patients are elderly, and more than a dozen of them are seriously ill, and two have died.

The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and the leading organs at all levels in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, are taking effective measures for emergency prevention and treatment. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has decided to send a team of epidemic prevention personnel with a batch of medicines to the Ding County area of Hebei Province for prevention and treatment. On the 19th, an epidemic prevention team was dispatched to Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government has sent personnel to Chahar Province to assist in the treatment of livestock epidemics. The Hebei Provincial Government has decided to send three epidemic prevention brigades. The first brigade, consisting of 45 people, rushed to the areas with the most severe epidemics, Quyang and Wuji, on the 20th of this month to conduct emergency rescue. The second epidemic prevention brigade, consisting of 120 people, including professors, doctors, students, and nurses from Hebei Medical College and its affiliated hospitals, doctors and nurses from the Provincial People's Hospital, and doctors and nurses from the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital, and the third epidemic prevention brigade, consisting of more than 40 people, including doctors and nurses from the Health Department of the Logistics Department of the Military Region and the Peace Hospital, led by Liu Heyi, Director of the Health Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and Lin Jinliang, Minister of the Health Department of the Logistics Department of the Hebei Military Region, respectively, went to various places in Ding County area on the 22nd to conduct rescue work. In addition, in order to effectively promote, inspect, and cooperate with the prevention and medical work, the Provincial Government has sent an inspection team led by Li Ziguang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, to Ding County area on the 22nd to carry out the work. After receiving the news of the epidemic, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government immediately sent a Kala-azar prevention and treatment team and a squadron of the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Team directly from Yancheng to Hua County. The Provincial Health Department has sent two doctors with a batch of medicines to Hua County to carry out prevention and treatment work. The Puyang and Xinxiang prefectural commissioners' offices have also urgently instructed all counties to organize doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine to quickly carry out rescue work.

After emergency treatment in the epidemic areas, the spread has stopped in some areas, but the epidemic is still continuing to develop in most areas. The local production and drought prevention organs and health departments must pay close attention to and grasp the epidemic, concentrate their efforts on prevention and treatment work, and not allow spring plowing to be affected.

    河北定县专区、察哈尔、平原滑县等地
    发生严重流行性传染病
    必须认真做好防治和抢救工作，不要使春耕受到影响
    河北省定县专区，察哈尔，平原省滑县、邺县和新乡专区等地，发生严重疫情。
    河北省定县专区八个县的部分村庄发生流行性感冒传染病，不少患者已因并发肺炎而死亡。据本月十六日统计，只曲阳县三区即有四十六个村发生此病，患者达两千人，其中有一百八十人死亡。十七日，定县发现患者一千六百二十五人，死亡三百零三人。无极县仅五区一个区即死亡一百五十人。此外，行唐四区也于二月中旬发现流行性感冒患者一千四百七十五人，死亡一百一十人。了解以上情况后，河北省人民政府卫生厅和定县专署马上派出专人到发病地区对疫情的发展情况作了全面调查和了解。到二十日，发现该专区的新乐、曲阳、行唐、博野、安平、定县、蠡县和无极等八个县都有流行性感冒传染病的发生，患者达四万五千二百六十六人，已有一千七百一十七人因并发肺炎死亡。其中仅无极一个县，就有患者一万三千六百五十二人，因并发肺炎死亡的有四百八十六人。
    患者症状，开始多是一般的感冒症状：头部疼痛发热，呼吸滞塞，四肢疼痛，甚至呕吐。合并而成重笃的肺炎，症状是咳嗽、喀血、呼吸促迫，约二三日即死亡。
    发病和造成疫病普遍流行的原因，除因为去冬今春雨雪很少，天气干燥和气候变化无常外，有的卫生行政领导部门和当地的卫生医疗组织，工作不深入，对疫情的严重程度估计不足，或不知道，也是使疫病发展的一个原因。根据以上严重情况，定县专区领导机关已迅速组织了七十九个干部和医务人员的医疗队，赶到各发病地区进行紧急抢救和预防。
    目前，流行性感冒在河北省其他地区也已经发生。邢台专区巨鹿县小官亭村，春节前后不少农民得了流行性感冒，从今年一月初到二月中旬，已有患者三十六人因并发肺炎死亡。唐山专区丰南县北岭、西丈夫坨和稻地三个村，患者也很多，从本月七日到十四日八天中，就有七个儿童死亡。石家庄专区获鹿、井陉、赞皇、灵寿、束鹿和晋县等六个县，也有此病发生。其中仅获鹿、井陉、赞皇和灵寿四个县，就有患者二千五百六十二人。
    察哈尔省今春麻疹、瘟病、天花等时疫也在蔓延，据十四个县的统计，已死亡一百二十余人，沽源一县，就有患麻疹的小孩一千余人。各种畜疫在察哈尔省也在发生，并已开始蔓延。察北专区患牛口蹄疫牲畜已达二千五百头。
    平原省滑县据自今年一月一日至二月十二日的调查，该县在十个区、三百九十九个村中，发生了腥红热、麻疹、扁桃腺炎、流行性感冒等传染病，患者已达四千三百零六人，死亡二百八十四人。疫病有蔓延全县的可能，严重地影响了群众的生产情绪和生产救灾工作的进行。另外，在范县二、四区，内黄四、六区，长垣二、十区，清丰六区，濮阳部分村庄以及郓城、聊城、菏泽、梁山等县也有大量传染病在流行。东明、城武也有较多传染病发生，其他各县也有散在性的疫情。邺县二区王寗村已有许多人患流行性感冒，死亡四人。其他五区、三区、七区也有传染病发生。全县有四个区，五十多村发现瘟疫流行。新乡专区由于去冬气候较暖，春节前后各地瘟疫不断发生，而且大部发生在灾区。春节前延津一区大潭村有一百二十多人得麻疹，经该县组织卫生院、医联会进行治疗后，大部已痊愈，但亦有九人死亡。盐厂患流行性感冒者百余人，大部均已治好。春节后感冒还不断发生，三区杨林、石邱等村由于县区领导机关发现较迟，情势严重，已病死四人。在春节前，辉县七区沙窝，患病者二十多人，虽经治疗，仍死了两个小孩。最近耿村等五个村得白喉者百余人（大部是小孩），现蔓延至三区梁马屯、楚桥等村。此外，一区南云门也发生脑膜炎，发病者大多是年老人，其中有十几个人病势较重，已死二人。
    中央人民政府卫生部、农业部、河北省和平原省各级领导机关，正采取有效措施紧急防治。中央人民政府卫生部已决定派出防疫人员一队，携带药品一部前往河北省定县专区进行防治。并于十九日派出防疫队，开往察哈尔、绥远二省。中央农业部则派人到察省协助救治畜疫。河北省省级机关已决定派出三个防疫大队。第一大队四十五人，已于本月二十日赶到疫病流行最严重的地区曲阳、无极一带进行紧急抢救。由河北医学院及其附属医院的教授、大夫、学员、护士和省第一人民医院的大夫、护士及省妇幼保健院医生、护士等共一百二十人组成的第二防疫大队和军区后勤部卫生部及和平医院医生、护士等四十余人组成的第三防疫大队，由河北省人民政府卫生厅刘和一厅长、河北省军区后勤部卫生部林金亮部长分别率领，于二十二日前往定县专区各地进行抢救。此外，为了有力地推动、检查和配合防治医疗工作，省级机关已派出一个检查小组，由中共河北省委秘书长李子光率领，二十二日赴定县专区进行工作。平原省人民政府在得到疫情消息后，立即派黑热病防治队和省防疫队一个中队，由郓城直赴滑县；省卫生厅已派医生两人，携带药品一部赴滑县进行防治工作。濮阳、新乡等专署，也都已紧急指示各县组织中西医生，迅速进行抢救工作。
    各疫区经紧急救治以后，虽有部分地区已停止蔓延，但大多数地区的疫情仍在继续发展中。各地生产防旱机关和卫生部门必须密切注意、掌握疫情，集中力量做好防治和抢救工作，不要使春耕受到影响。
