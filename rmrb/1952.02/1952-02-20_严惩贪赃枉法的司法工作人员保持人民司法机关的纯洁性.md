    Severely Punish Corrupt and Law-Bending Judicial Workers to Maintain the Purity of the People's Judicial Organs
    The vast majority of our country's judicial workers are serious about upholding the law. However, some judicial workers have surrendered to the bourgeoisie's attacks and betrayed the people, degenerating into corrupt, law-bending scoundrels who serve unscrupulous merchants. Ding Ru琛, the presiding judge of the Criminal Tribunal of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court, and others are such examples. Due to the surrender of Ding Ru琛 and others, the Nanjing Municipal People's Court lost its nature as a people's judicial organ in handling several cases. Many intolerable things happened. Cheng Jialun, a profiteer who illegally purchased large quantities of railway tracks and sabotaged railways, was given a light sentence; Li Renshan, a profiteer who concealed enemy and puppet materials, was paroled; Tang Wenhua, a criminal who counterfeited currency and disrupted national finance, became the "talent" needed by the Nanjing Xinhua Daily; important archives were destroyed; even counter-revolutionaries were released! The dignity of the people's law and the credibility of the people's court have been seriously damaged, and the property of the state and the people has lost legal protection! If this situation is not changed, the victories already won in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle will be buried by them!
    In order to safeguard the victories already won in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle, and to make the people's court a powerful protector of the lives and property of the state and the people, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the judicial departments must be carried out thoroughly. The relationship between judicial workers and the bourgeoisie must be thoroughly clarified. It must be checked whether judicial workers have been bought by the bourgeoisie to serve the bourgeoisie, whether they have abused their powers for extortion, and whether they have been corrupted by bourgeois ideology. Those with ideological problems should be educated to correct them. If there are any acts of violating the law while enforcing the law, legal sanctions should be implemented without hesitation, so that our judicial organs can be purified through this great anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle, become a powerful tool of the people's democratic dictatorship, and exert the great power of the people's judicial organs in the battle to counterattack the bourgeoisie's offensive.

    严惩贪赃枉法的司法工作人员保持人民司法机关的纯洁性
    我们国家的司法工作人员，绝大多数是严肃维护法纪的。但是，也有一部分司法工作人员，经不起资产阶级的进攻而缴械投降，背叛了人民，堕落成为贪赃枉法、为奸商服务的蟊贼。南京市人民法院刑事审判庭庭长丁汝琛等，就是这样的。由于丁汝琛等的缴械投降，南京市人民法院在处理若干案件中，失掉了它作为人民司法机关的性质。许多不能容忍的事情发生了。大量套购铁轨、破坏铁路的奸商程家伦竟被轻判；隐匿敌伪物资的奸商李仁山被假释；伪造货币、扰乱国家金融的罪犯唐文华成了南京新华日报所必需的“人材”；重要的档案被销毁；甚至反革命分子也被放跑了！人民法律的尊严和人民法院的信誉遭到了严重损害，国家和人民的财产失掉了法律的保障！这种情况如不改变，反贪污、反行贿斗争中已经得到的胜利会被他们葬送的！
    为了保障反贪污、反行贿斗争中已经得到的胜利，为了使人民法院真正成为国家和人民生命财产的有力保护者，司法部门的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，必须进行彻底，把司法工作人员和资产阶级的关系彻底弄清楚，检查司法工作人员是否有被资产阶级收买而为资产阶级服务的情形，是否有滥用职权进行敲诈勒索的不法行为，是否接受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀。思想上有问题的，应该对他们进行教育，促其改正。如有执法犯法行为，应当毫不姑息地实行法律制裁，使我们的司法机关经过这次伟大的反贪污、反行贿斗争而纯洁起来，成为人民民主专政的有力工具，在向资产阶级的进攻进行反击的战斗中，发挥人民司法机关的巨大威力。
