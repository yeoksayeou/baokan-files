    Celebrating the Great Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Alliance
    Li Jishen
    February 14, 1950, was the day the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed. This year, on this day, is the second anniversary of the signing of this great alliance treaty. We celebrate this great anniversary in the history of Chinese revolutionary diplomacy with extremely excited and joyful feelings. When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was first signed, Chairman Mao solemnly and clearly stated: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. This unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice throughout the world." The performance of all facts in the past two years has proved that the great role and influence of this great and sacred alliance treaty is completely in line with Chairman Mao's scientific prediction, completely in line with the revolutionary interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and completely in line with the just demands of peace-loving people all over the world. Marshal Stalin said in his congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao on the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: "I am convinced that our treaty will always be conducive to the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the consolidation of the cause of world peace." This makes the spirit and essence of the treaty and its significant political significance even more clear and thorough. Therefore, as we celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of this great alliance treaty today, we quote the correct arguments of the great leaders of China and the Soviet Union, and cite the changes in the major situations in the Far East and the world in the past two years, which makes us more aware of the importance of this great alliance treaty, and further strengthens our firm will to support this great alliance treaty and our firm confidence in its invincibility in the world.

    The preamble of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance clearly declares that its purpose is "to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the resumption of aggression by Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggressive acts," and Article 1 of the treaty further clearly stipulates that: "The two contracting parties jointly guarantee to make every necessary effort to take all necessary measures to prevent the resurgence of Japan or any country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in aggressive acts and undermines peace. Once either of the contracting parties is attacked by Japan or a country allied with Japan and is thus in a state of war, the other contracting party shall immediately give its full military and other assistance." This shows that the two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, are going to jointly make every effort to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and prevent all imperialists from using Japan as a tool to invade China, invade the Soviet Union, and further undermine world peace; but on the other hand, it also shows that the people of China and the Soviet Union need peace and oppose war. If the imperialists recklessly launch a war to undermine peace, the people of China and the Soviet Union are not afraid of war, and will certainly rise up to resist aggression and maintain peace, and believe that peace can certainly overcome war, and the imperialist aggressors will inevitably suffer the final defeat.

    Ignoring China and the Soviet Union's repeated warnings and firm opposition, the US imperialists and their accomplices brazenly convened the so-called San Francisco Conference on September 4, 1951, and signed the so-called "Japanese Peace Treaty" and the "US-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty." These US-made treaties, whether viewed from their words or spirit, are obviously treaties that revive Japanese militarism, are hostile to China and the Soviet Union, threaten Asia, and prepare for a new war of aggression. Not only the people of China and the Soviet Union resolutely oppose this, but the people of the entire Asia and the people of the world also express their utmost indignation and firm opposition to the US imperialists' war preparations that create a tense situation in Asia and the world. The US imperialists are still frantically arming Japan today, using the Japanese traitorous clique, attempting to use Japan as a base and the Japanese people as cannon fodder, to continue and expand the war of aggression, and to plunge the Japanese nation into a situation of destruction; at the same time, they are instructing the remnant bandits in Taiwan to recklessly attempt to launch an adventurous probe on the mainland, and using various excuses to hinder and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, as well as engaging in slander and provocation against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China at the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. All of these are intolerable to the people of China and the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people all over the world. We dare to say that the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and war policies, no matter how adventurous they are in front of the solid fortress of the Sino-Soviet alliance, will not have any effect, but will be completely crushed and destroyed.

    The first four articles of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance are all about preventing aggression, and Article 5 clearly stipulates that "The two contracting parties guarantee to develop and consolidate the economic and cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union in the spirit of friendly cooperation and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and to provide each other with all possible economic assistance and carry out necessary economic cooperation." Since the founding of the People's Republic of China two years ago, due to the loyal implementation of this sacred alliance treaty by the great ally, the Soviet Union, the brilliant and remarkable achievements in all aspects, especially in economic construction and cultural construction, are inseparable from the brotherly and enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Under the circumstances that the United States is invading Korea and Taiwan and imposing an economic blockade on China, the Soviet Union's trade with China has prevented major difficulties in China's necessary imports and exports, and has instead caused serious losses to US and British imperialism. The role of this great friendship is even more worthy of cherishing and gratitude in our days of arduous struggle against US aggression and aiding Korea.

    The brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is increasingly envied and hated by a very small number of imperialist plunderers, and is increasingly supported by the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving and just people all over the world, and thus is increasingly consolidated. We firmly believe that the consolidation and development of this great alliance will greatly strengthen the strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will seriously strike at the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States. In order to build a prosperous and great motherland, in order to eliminate the influence and forces of the imperialists' centuries of aggression against our country, in order to prevent all imperialists from making a comeback and engaging in aggression again, and in order to maintain the lasting peace and long-term happiness of all mankind in the world, we must make the people of the whole country more universally and deeply aware of the great significance of this great friendly alliance treaty, and support this great brotherly friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union with greater strength. On this day of celebrating this unprecedented victory in diplomacy with great historical significance, I sincerely hope that the people of the whole country will uniformly follow Chairman Mao's correct foreign policy of "leaning to one side", and work together to strive to the end for the consolidation and development of the unbreakable friendship between the two great allied nations, China and the Soviet Union.

    庆祝中苏友好同盟的伟大纪念日
    李济深
    一九五○年二月十四日，是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的日子。今年此日，正是这个伟大同盟条约签订的两周年，我们以极兴奋愉快的心情，来庆祝这中国革命外交史上的伟大纪念日。当中苏友好同盟互助条约刚签订的时候，毛主席曾郑重而明确的说：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的、不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”两年来一切事实的表现，在在证明了这一伟大神圣同盟条约所发生的巨大作用和影响，是完全符合毛主席这一科学的预见，是完全符合中苏两大国人民革命的利益，是完全符合全世界爱好和平人民的正义要求。斯大林大元帅在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年之际，致毛主席的贺电中曾这样地说：“我深信我们的条约将始终有利于中苏两国间的友谊和全世界和平事业的巩固。”这更把条约的精神和实质及其签订的重大政治意义，说得愈加显明透彻。因此，我们在庆祝这一伟大同盟条约签订两周年的今日，申引中苏两国伟大领袖的正确论断，并引证两年来远东和全世界一切重大情势的变化，使我们更认识到这一伟大同盟条约的重要性，并更增加了我们拥护这一伟大同盟条约的坚强意志和它无敌于天下的坚强信心。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的序文，明确地宣布了它的目的是“防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”，而条约第一条更明确地规定了：“缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭，因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。”这说明了中苏两大国是要共同尽力防止日本帝国主义之再起，防止一切帝国主义者利用日本为侵略中国、侵略苏联，并进而破坏世界和平之工具；但另一方也说明了，中苏两国人民需要和平，反对战争，如帝国主义者甘冒不韪发动战争破坏和平，中苏两国人民是不怕战争的，必然要起而反抗侵略维护和平，并且相信和平一定是可以战胜战争的，帝国主义侵略者必然要遭到最后的惨败。
    美帝国主义者及其帮凶们不顾中国和苏联的屡次警告和坚决的反对，竟于一九五一年九月四日蛮横地召集所谓旧金山会议，签订了所谓“对日和约”及“日美双边安全条约”，这些美制条约无论从其文字和精神上看，很显然的是复活日本军国主义，敌视中苏，威胁亚洲，准备新的侵略战争的条约。不仅中苏两国人民对此坚决表示反对，即全亚洲的人民和全世界人民，对美帝国主义者这一造成亚洲和世界紧张局势的备战行动，也表示万分的愤慨和坚决的反对。美帝国主义者直到今日仍不顾一切正在疯狂地进行武装日本，利用日本卖国集团，企图以日本为基地，以日本人民为炮灰，继续与扩大侵略战争，陷日本民族于毁灭的境地；同时指使台湾残匪妄图向大陆上作冒险试探的蠢动，并用种种借口阻碍和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的进行，以及在联合国第六届大会上对于苏联和中华人民共和国的诽谤和挑衅行为，这都是中苏两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民所不能容忍的。我们敢断定地说，帝国主义者的侵略阴谋和战争政策，在中苏友好同盟的坚固堡垒前，无论如何进行冒险，是不会发生任何效用，而且是要被彻底粉碎和毁灭的。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的前四条都是防止侵略的，第五条则明确规定了“缔约国双方保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展和巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作。”由于伟大盟邦——苏联忠实地执行这一神圣盟约，中华人民共和国成立两年以来，在各方面辉煌显著的成就，特别是在经济建设和文化建设方面的成就，是与苏联政府和苏联人民兄弟般热情的帮助是分不开的。在美国侵略朝鲜、台湾并对中国实行经济封锁的情形下，苏联对中国的贸易，使中国必要的进出口没有发生大的困难，反而使美英帝国主义遭受了严重的损失，这一伟大友情的作用，在我们抗美援朝艰苦奋斗的日子，更是值得珍重和感谢的。
    中苏两国兄弟般的同盟愈加为极少数的帝国主义掠夺者们所嫉视与痛恨，就愈加为中苏两国人民和全世界一切爱好和平与正义的人民所拥护，因而就愈加巩固起来了。我们深信这一伟大同盟的巩固和发展是要大大加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营力量，是要严重地打击以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团。我们为了建设一个繁荣伟大的祖国，为了肃清帝国主义者百年来侵略我国的影响和势力，为了防止一切帝国主义的卷土重来再从事侵略，为了维护全世界人类的持久和平和长远幸福，我们必须使全国人民更普遍而深入地认识这一伟大友好同盟条约的重大意义，并以更大的力量来拥护中苏两国这一伟大兄弟般的友好同盟。我在庆祝这一具有伟大历史意义的外交上空前胜利的日子，诚恳地希望全国人民一致遵行毛主席“一边倒”的正确外交政策，大家齐心努力为巩固和发展中苏两大盟国牢不可破的友谊而奋斗到底。
