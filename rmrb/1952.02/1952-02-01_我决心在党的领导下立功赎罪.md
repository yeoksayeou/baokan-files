I Resolve to Expiate My Crimes Through Meritorious Service Under the Leadership of the Party
Cui Yun
In this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, I have thoroughly examined the erosion of my thinking by bourgeois ideology; investigated illegal activities in leading the production of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China; and also examined my bureaucratic work style.

Since entering the city, influenced by bourgeois corrupting ideas, I mistakenly believed that life should be "urbanized" and "ostentatious," and thus fell into the mire of waste and corruption. When repairing the greenhouse, some comrades suggested that such extravagance was inappropriate, but I mistakenly thought that these comrades were still too "rustic" and did not consider their opinions at all. Seeing that the office production was making money, I pursued enjoyment, eating and drinking carelessly, and even arbitrarily used public property for gifts and entertainment. This behavior of not distinguishing between public and private and arbitrarily squandering state wealth is actually an act of "happily" stealing state assets. This clearly shows that I have not inherited the Party's glorious tradition of hard work, simplicity, honesty, and public service, but have been seriously infected by the exploitative class's ideas of luxury and enjoyment. Now I realize that the past idea that I was a "leader" and spending a little more money was not a big deal is actually a reflection of bourgeois privilege thinking; it is also a "shield" for the corrupt act of stealing and wasting state assets.

The corruption of my bourgeois ideology is more prominently manifested in my leadership of office production.

In order to seek exorbitant profits, I disregarded national laws and regulations, privately misappropriated huge amounts of public funds, and engaged in office production, completely falling into the mire of bourgeois profiteering and speculation. In addition, I harbored personal heroism, always wanting the office production I led to be praised by everyone, so I invested in a private trading firm in Tianjin for illegal business. Moreover, I thought that doing so would make money without anyone knowing, and I was very proud of it. In fact, it was not that I did not know the system of special funds for special purposes, but because I only thought about the interests of my own unit, I mistakenly believed that public funds were useless when left in the bank, and it didn't seem to matter if I borrowed them with interest. So I used my power to achieve this goal. This shows that I myself severely lack a sense of the state and a sense of the overall situation, and that there is a serious existence of departmentalism and privilege thinking, which is not allowed by Party discipline and national law.

My bureaucratic work style is also very serious. This is manifested in the fact that I spend all day going around in circles in administrative affairs, instead of concentrating on major issues. I have never inspected the leadership of office production, but only asked "loss or profit?" after a certain period of time. If there was a loss, I would quickly try to find a way to make up for it, and if there was a profit, I would be complacent. Although there are reports on office production, I don't read them much; even if I do, I just take a cursory look at the profits and losses. On the other hand, I rarely understand the actual difficulties in the lives of cadres. For example, at the recent Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Congress, someone reported that the comrades below had many difficulties in their lives that could not be resolved. But before that, I didn't know at all. This shows that I lack a mass perspective and that my bureaucracy is very serious. During my tenure as Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee, I was derelict in my duties.

The root cause of the above serious errors is mainly the serious "meritorious", "complacent", and "enjoyment" thinking that exists in my mind. I neither study hard nor actively participate in strict organizational life. I do not listen to or accept the criticism of comrades, and I act arbitrarily. Therefore, I have been separated from the supervision of the Party and the masses, my ideological awareness cannot be improved, and under the fierce invasion of bourgeois corrupting ideas, I cannot maintain the glorious tradition of hard work, simplicity, and selflessness that a Communist Party member should have, and even develop to the point of violating laws and disciplines, arbitrarily squandering and wasting state assets, causing serious damage to the Party's work and the property of the state and the people, and damaging the Party's prestige among the masses. As for the political losses caused to the Party, they are incalculable. Now, I have realized that my crimes are serious. I have failed the Party and the people. I request the Party to give me strict disciplinary action in order to enforce Party discipline, save and educate myself. At the same time, I ask the Party to give me a chance to repent, and I guarantee that I will make contributions to atone for my sins in future work.

    我决心在党的领导下立功赎罪
    崔运
    在这次反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动中，我清算了资产阶级思想对自己的侵蚀；检查了在领导中共石家庄市委机关生产中的违法行为；同时检查了自己的官僚主义作风。
    自入城以后，我受了资产阶级腐化思想的影响，错误地认为生活上要“城市化”，要“排场”，于是就陷入浪费腐化的泥坑里。修花房时，有的同志曾提出不该这样铺张，我却错误地认为这些同志的“土气”还没有去掉，根本不去考虑这些意见。我见机关生产赚了钱，就追求享受，吃点喝点，满不在乎，还任意用公家财物送礼请客。这种公私不分、任意挥霍国家财富的行为，实际上就是“快乐的”盗窃国家资财的行为。这就明显地看出了我没有继承党的艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公的光荣传统，而是严重地沾染了剥削阶级奢侈享乐的思想。现在我认识到，过去的那种以为自己是“首长”，多花点钱不算什么的思想，实际上是资产阶级特权思想的反映；也是盗窃浪费国家资财的贪污行为的“挡箭牌”。
    资产阶级思想对我的腐蚀，更突出地表现在我对机关生产的领导上。
    为了谋取暴利，我不顾国家法纪，私自挪用巨额公款，搞机关生产，完全陷入资产阶级唯利是图、投机取巧的泥坑里。加上我存在着个人英雄主义，总想使自己领导的机关生产，人人说好，于是在天津市私营贸易行投资，作非法生意。而且我还认为这样作真是神不知鬼不觉就把钱赚到手里了，很是得意。事实上，我不是不知道专款专用的制度，但因为只为本单位的利益着想，就错误地认为公款在银行白放着也没用，付上利息，借用一下似乎也不算什么。于是利用职权，达到了这个目的。这说明我自己十分缺乏国家观念、整体观念，严重存在着本位主义及特权思想，这是党纪和国法所不容的。
    我的官僚主义作风也是很严重的。这表现在我整天在行政事务里打圈子，而不是集中精力注意大的问题。对机关生产的领导，也从来没有进行过检查，只是到一定时间问一问“赔了还是赚了？”赔了就赶紧想办法补窟窿，赚了就自鸣得意。机关生产虽有表报，但我不大看；就是看也只是草草地看看赔赚而已。另一方面，对干部生活上的实际困难自己很少了解，如这次石家庄市党的代表会议上，有人反映下边同志们生活上有很多困难，无法解决。但在这以前我是根本不知道的。这说明了我缺乏群众观点，官僚主义是十分严重的。在担任市委秘书长职务期间，我是失职的。
    造成以上严重错误的根源，主要是自己存在着严重的“功臣”、“自满”、“享乐”思想，既不好好学习，又不积极参加严格的组织生活，不听取、不接受同志们的批评，独断专行。因此，脱离了党和群众的监督，思想觉悟不能提高，在资产阶级腐化思想的猛烈侵袭下，不能保持共产党员应有的艰苦朴素、克己奉公的光荣传统，以致发展到违法犯纪，任意挥霍和浪费国家资财，给党的工作和国家人民的财产造成严重的损失，损害了党在群众中的威信，至于给党所造成的政治上的损失更是无法计算的。现在，我已认识到我的罪恶是严重的，我对不起党，对不起人民群众。我请求党给我以严格的纪律处分，以严肃党纪，挽救和教育我自己。同时，我请求党给我以悔改的机会，我保证今后在实际工作中立功赎罪。
