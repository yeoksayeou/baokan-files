    Lu Shoufan, a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, is an accountant at the Grain Bureau of the People's Government of Qianshan County, Jiangxi Province. She bravely reported the collective corruption case involving the director and deputy director of the Grain Bureau, among others.

    Lu Shoufan was introduced to the Grain Bureau of the People's Government of Qianshan County by the Jiangxi Provincial Finance and Economics School in January 1950 to serve as an accountant. In June 1950, Liu Demin, the director of the Grain Bureau, began his criminal behavior under the erosion of bourgeois ideology. Liu Demin told Lu Shoufan not to report 22,200 jin of public grain and 15,000 jin of surplus inventory grain. Liu also deceived her, saying, "The bureau has large expenses and insufficient funds. These grains will be kept for the bureau to purchase equipment. This is allowed by the higher authorities. If there is a problem, I will be responsible." Because Lu Shoufan had only been working for a short time, she did not doubt his words and did not report these two amounts of grain. Later, she saw the director Liu Demin, deputy director Liu Xiaoguo, warehouse director Lu Shiyi, and the main accountant Zou Yangsheng (retained personnel) often eating and drinking extravagantly, and buying radios, watches, and bicycles, spending money lavishly. At this time, Lu Shoufan began to suspect the source of their spending. In March 1951, when Lu Shoufan attended the provincial grain administration accounting conference in Jiangxi Province, she realized that Liu Demin's failure to report public grain and surplus inventory grain was an irregular "ambush" behavior. She reported these situations to the higher authorities. Soon after Lu Shoufan returned to Qianshan County, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau sent people to cooperate with the Finance and Economics Discipline Inspection Team of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee to conduct an investigation. Liu Demin immediately colluded with Liu Xiaoguo, Zou Yangsheng, and other corrupt elements to secretly hold meetings and forge false accounts. At that time, Lu Shoufan only knew that they were "laying an ambush" but did not know how they were embezzling from it. Therefore, this inspection was muddled through by Liu Demin and others using despicable means of deceiving superiors and suppressing subordinates.

    After this inspection, Liu Demin and others suspected that Lu Shoufan had reported them in Nanchang. Liu Demin called Lu to question her. Lu Shoufan admitted that she had reflected this situation at the last grain administration accounting conference. As soon as Liu heard this, he shamelessly threatened her, saying, "But you must know that this is not good for you. Your approach has affected the relationship between superiors and subordinates." Liu also used his position as the secretary of the Youth League branch to force Lu Shoufan to admit that reporting the situation was a wrong behavior and asked her to "reexamine herself." Because Lu Shoufan reported the facts, she bravely insisted on her own opinion and refused to reexamine herself. This group of corrupt elements then adopted the means of winning over and suppressing people in the bureau, saying things like, "Lu Shoufan's reflection of the situation this time has ruined the entire Grain Bureau's 'good reputation'," "Reflecting the situation is 'small broadcast', 'liberalism'," and so on. They attempted to create dissatisfaction with Lu among the masses in the bureau. They also threatened other personnel not to learn from Lu and report to higher levels. For backward masses, they used some petty favors to win them over, attempting to isolate Lu Shoufan. Although Lu Shoufan was attacked by corrupt elements, she did not compromise with them. She believed that the failure of the last inspection was mainly because she did not have enough materials and did not unite other accountants to collect evidence of their corruption together. After that, she paid attention to uniting the accountants and cashiers in the bureau, asking them to pay attention to the criminal evidence of Liu Demin and other corrupt elements at any time. She secretly recorded the corruption accounts of Liu Demin and others' false reports of grain storage and misappropriation of public funds each time. At the same time, she planned how to report these situations. At this time, the corrupt elements' attacks on her became more and more vicious, and even secretly monitored her actions. When Lu Shoufan went to mail three letters of accusation to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, the Shangrao Commissioner's Office, and the Qianshan County People's Government, she was discovered by the corrupt element Zou Yangsheng. Zou Yangsheng reported to Liu Demin. Liu even abused his authority to organize a "struggle meeting," threatening Lu Shoufan to reveal who she wrote to and the content of the letters, and falsely accusing her of having "political problems," threatening her that if she did not "confess and reexamine herself," she would be sent to the Public Security Bureau. But this did not scare Lu Shoufan. Liu Demin and other corrupt elements became even more panicked and openly went to the Public Security Bureau to falsely accuse Lu Shoufan, requesting the Public Security Bureau to arrest Lu. Because the Public Security Bureau did not have concrete evidence, they rejected Liu's request.

    At this time, although Lu Shoufan felt very painful in her mind, her struggle was not isolated. Several accountants in the bureau closely united around her and actively collected evidence of the corrupt elements' crimes, which gave her great encouragement and thus increased her courage and confidence in the struggle. Lu Shoufan's accusation aroused the attention of the higher-level leading organs, and first received the support of Wang Xiuzhang, the county magistrate of the People's Government of Qianshan County. County Magistrate Wang personally talked to her, comforted her, and asked her to continue to collect evidence of the corrupt elements' crimes. The county People's Government informed the Qianshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China of these situations and reported to the higher-level leading organs. After the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, the Shangrao Commissioner's Office Finance and Economics Committee, and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shangrao Local Committee of the Communist Party of China learned of this incident, they immediately sent people to investigate. The investigation results were completely consistent with the facts reported by Lu Shoufan. A total of five people were involved in this case. They embezzled more than 130 million yuan by stealing and selling warehouse grain, colluding with private merchants to underreport processed rice, and falsely reporting expenses. Now these shameless and insidious corrupt elements have been punished accordingly. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shangrao Local Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to expel Liu Demin, Liu Xiaoguo, Lu Shiyi, and others from the Party. The People's Court has arrested the corrupt elements involved in this case and will be punished according to law. Lu Shoufan, who resolutely fought against corrupt elements to the end, was praised by the higher authorities and warmly loved by the masses. Now, she has been selected as a model member of the Youth League Qianshan County People's Government branch.

    坚决与贪污分子作斗争的女青年团员卢守凡
    新华社记者  岳革新
    中国新民主主义青年团团员卢守凡，是江西省铅山县人民政府粮食局的会计，她勇敢地检举了粮食局局长、副局长等集体贪污案。
    卢守凡在一九五零年一月由江西省立财政经济学校介绍到铅山县人民政府粮食局担任会计。一九五零年六月，粮食局局长刘德敏在资产阶级思想的侵蚀下开始他的犯罪行为。刘德敏告诉卢守凡不要把二万二千二百斤公产粮和一万五千斤库存余粮上报。刘并欺骗她说：“局里面开支大，经费不够用，这些粮食留下来作为局里添置设备的费用，这是上级允许的，如果出了问题，由我负责。”卢守凡因为参加工作不久，对他的话并不怀疑，就没有将这两笔粮食报上去。以后，她看见局长刘德敏、副局长刘孝国、仓库主任鹿士义和主办会计邹扬生（留用人员）经常在一起大吃大喝，并且买了收音机、手表、自行车，用钱挥霍无度。这时卢守凡开始怀疑他们这些花费的来源，一九五一年三月，卢守凡到江西省人民政府粮食局参加全省粮政会计会议时，她认识到刘德敏不将公产粮和库存余粮上报是一种不合制度的“打埋伏”行为。她就把这些情形报告给上级。卢守凡回到铅山县不久，江西省人民政府粮食局就派人协同中南军政委员会财经纪律检查组来进行调查。刘德敏马上纠合刘孝国、邹扬生等贪污分子秘密开会，伪造假帐。当时卢守凡只知道他们“打埋伏”，不知道他们是怎样从中贪污的。因此，这次检查就被刘德敏等使用欺上压下的卑污手段矇混过去了。
    经过这次检查，刘德敏等猜疑是卢守凡在南昌检举他们的，刘德敏就找卢去问话。卢守凡承认她在上次粮政会计会议时曾反映过这一情况，刘一听说，马上就无耻地威胁她说：“可是你要知道这是对你自己不利的，你这样做法，影响了上下级的关系。”刘并利用青年团支部书记的职权，强迫卢守凡承认反映情况是错误行为，叫她“反省”。卢守凡因检举的是事实，勇敢地坚持自己的意见，拒绝反省。这一批贪污分子于是在局里采取拉拢压制的手段，说什么“卢守凡这一次反映情况，把整个粮食局的‘好评’都搞垮了。”，“反映情况是‘小广播’、‘自由主义’”等等。他们企图在局里造成群众对卢的不满。他们又恐吓其他人员不要学卢那样越级汇报。对落后的群众，就用一些小恩小惠来笼络他们，企图把卢守凡孤立起来。卢守凡虽然受到贪污分子的打击，但是她并没有向贪污分子妥协。她认为上次检查的失败，主要是因为自己掌握材料不够，同时没有团结其他会计人员来共同收集他们的贪污证据。以后，她就注意团结局里的会计和出纳人员，请他们随时注意刘德敏等贪污分子的犯罪证据。她把刘德敏等每次虚报存粮和挪用公款的贪污帐目都在暗地里记下来。同时，她就计划着如何把这些情况反映上去。这时贪污分子对她的攻击也愈来愈恶毒了，甚至暗中监视她的行动。卢守凡去寄发写给江西省人民政府、上饶专员公署和铅山县人民政府的三份控告书的时候，被贪污分子邹扬生发现了，邹扬生就报告刘德敏，刘竟假借职权，组织“斗争会”，威胁卢守凡说出写信给谁和信的内容，并且诬蔑她有“政治问题”，威胁她如不“坦白反省”就送到公安局去。但是这样并没有把卢守凡吓倒。刘德敏等贪污分子更加恐慌起来，竟公然到公安局诬告卢守凡，要求公安局把卢逮捕。公安局因为没有确实证据，拒绝了刘的要求。
    这时，卢守凡的思想上虽然感到很痛苦，但是她的斗争并不是孤立的，局里几个会计人员紧紧团结在她的周围，积极地收集贪污分子的罪证，这使她得到很大的鼓舞，因此更增加了斗争的勇气和信心。卢守凡的控告，引起了上级领导机关的重视，首先得到铅山县人民政府县长王修章的支持。王县长亲自找她去谈话，安慰她，叫她继续收集贪污分子的犯罪证据。县人民政府一面把这些情况告知中共铅山县委员会，一面报告上级领导机关。江西省人民政府、上饶专员公署财政经济委员会、中共上饶地方委员会纪律检查委员会知道这一事件后，立即派人前来调查。调查结果和卢守凡检举事实完全符合。这个案件有关人员共计五人，他们盗卖仓库存粮、勾结私商少报加工米以及虚报开支，共贪污人民币一亿三千多万元。现在这些无耻、阴险的贪污分子已分别受到了制裁。中共上饶地方委员会纪律检查委员会决定开除刘德敏、刘孝国、鹿士义等三人党籍。人民法院已将此案有关的贪污分子逮捕，将依法惩办。坚决和贪污分子斗争到底的卢守凡得到上级的表扬，并受到群众的热烈爱戴。现在，她已被青年团铅山县人民政府支部评选为模范团员。
