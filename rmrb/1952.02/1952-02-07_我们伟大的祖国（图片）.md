    Our Great Motherland
    Today is the 29th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike. Railway workers across the country are inheriting and promoting the glorious tradition of "February 7th," extensively and deeply engaging in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and resolutely repelling the bourgeoisie's attack. Tang Zhongsan, a propagandist from the Fengtai Materials Factory of the Tianjin Railway Administration, is an old worker from the "February 7th" strike. He and his fellow workers exposed and captured five major embezzlers. This picture shows him using a clapper talk to conduct propaganda among the porters.
