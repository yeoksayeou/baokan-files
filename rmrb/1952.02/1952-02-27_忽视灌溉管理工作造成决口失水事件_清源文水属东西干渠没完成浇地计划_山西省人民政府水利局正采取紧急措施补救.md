　　Due to substandard construction of canal projects and neglect of irrigation management, the east and west main canals under the jurisdiction of the Fen River Water Conservancy Committee in Qingyuan and Wenshui counties, Shanxi Province, suffered more than thirty breaches and water losses. This not only seriously wasted water and the labor of the people, but also delayed drought prevention and spring irrigation work.

　　The east and west main canals in Qingyuan and Wenshui counties, part of the Fen River system, are relatively large canals in Shanxi Province. Last year, in order to expand the irrigated area, the canals were redesigned according to the principle of scientific water use, with a wide upper reach and a narrow lower reach. However, because the branch canals, capillary canals, ditch canals, and water control gates were not all completed, all canal water was discharged through the main canals. In addition, the construction did not involve tamping the canal banks firmly, resulting in loose banks. The canal banks that had been soaked with water last year became harder after drying, while the banks that had not been wetted by water remained very loose. In this way, many gaps naturally formed between the wetted and unwetted parts of the canal banks. When the water level was higher than the area wetted last year, water leaked from these gaps. The Fen River Water Conservancy Committee did not adequately anticipate this situation, neglected irrigation management, and failed to conduct inspections. Therefore, when water was introduced for irrigation in early February, the canal water froze, and the canals were blocked by ice, preventing the water from flowing smoothly. This caused the water level to rise above the gaps in the canal banks, resulting in breaches in the new canal banks from Gao Che to Xiaonanshe. Secondly, in some areas, the masses of farmers built many wooden floating bridges near the water surface along the canals, blocking the ice from flowing downstream. Some areas did not carry out the work of leveling the land and reducing the gate openings. Some, after watering in winter, did not remove the frozen surface layer when sealing the openings, resulting in insecure seals. Some even forced high water levels for irrigation, which slowed down the flow of water in the main canals and made the canal water easier to freeze. This was also a cause of the breaches and water losses.

　　After the breaches and water losses in the main canals, the Fen River Water Conservancy Committee dispatched cadres to lead the masses in actively repairing the breaches. However, because the new canals were shallower and the old canals were deeper, the water loss upstream prevented irrigation downstream. Therefore, from the Spring Festival until now, only more than 60,000 mu of land along the main canals have been irrigated. Even with the 40,000 mu already irrigated in Fenyang, only a total of more than 100,000 mu have been irrigated. Including the acreage irrigated last winter, the total is only over 400,000 mu, which is 200,000 mu less than at this time last year, and far short of the planned 1 million mu for last winter and this spring. This seriously hinders drought prevention and drought resistance work.

　　After this incident occurred, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau immediately sent many engineers to the areas with breaches and water losses to conduct surveys. It has decided to take the following emergency measures for remediation: (1) The bottom and banks downstream of the spillway gate have been scoured. If water cannot be discharged smoothly, it will greatly hinder irrigation. In addition to deciding to disperse the water flow in management to reduce scouring, the leadership has also sent engineering personnel to direct repairs, with the plan to complete them within half a month to ensure irrigation. (2) The Fen River Water Conservancy Committee has been urgently ordered to send capable cadres to dismantle the wooden floating bridges erected in various places to ensure unimpeded water flow. It is also mobilizing district and village water conservancy cadres and the masses along the canals to carefully inspect the canal banks for cracks and holes, and educating farmers to remove the frozen surface layer when sealing the openings after irrigation. (3) Relevant counties are notified to dispatch cadres to cooperate with the Fen River Water Conservancy Committee to follow the water flow for irrigation and strengthen irrigation management to prevent any further breaches and water losses. (4) All special districts and counties, and all river systems, especially the newly constructed canals in the Xiao River and Hutuo River, are notified to carefully inspect the canals and dams, and strengthen irrigation management. During the period when the ice melts and spring warms up, it is crucial to quickly organize farmers to seize the opportunity to ensure the completion of the spring irrigation task in order to make up for the losses caused by the breaches and water losses.

    忽视灌溉管理工作造成决口失水事件
    清源文水属东西干渠没完成浇地计划
    山西省人民政府水利局正采取紧急措施补救
    山西省汾河水利委员会所辖清源、文水两县属的东、西干渠，因渠道工程施工不合标准和忽视灌溉管理，三十多处决口失水；不仅严重地浪费了水量和民工的劳动力，还延迟了防旱和春浇工作。
    汾河水系清源、文水属的东、西干渠，是山西省较大的渠道。去年为了扩大灌溉面积，根据科学施水的原则设计，重新修成上游宽下游窄的渠道，但由于支渠、毛渠、斗渠和控制水的闸口没有全部修好，因此所有渠水都由干渠吞吐；加上施工中没有行硪打实，渠堤松软。去年灌水时浸湿的渠堤干后便较前硬实，而没有被水渗湿的渠堤却非常松软，这样，渠堤湿过的和没湿过的中间就自然形成许多隙缝，如遇水位高出去年渗湿的范围时，中间隙缝就漏水。汾河水利委员会对这种情况事前估计不够，又忽视灌溉管理，更没有进行检查，因而在二月初灌水浇地时，由于渠水结冰，渠道被冰块拥塞，渠水不能顺流下去，使水位增高超过了渠堤隙缝，所以从高车到小南社一段新渠渠堤就决口了。其次，有些地区农民群众沿渠搭架了许多靠近水面的草木浮桥，挡住冰块流不下去；有些地区没有进行平整地段和缩小闸口的工作；有的在去冬浇地后，封口时没有把底层冻皮揭去，封口不牢；甚至有的还逼高水位浇地，结果使干渠流水迟慢，使渠水容易结冰，这也是决口失水的原因。
    干渠决口失水后，汾河水利委员会虽抽派干部领导群众积极抢堵，但因新渠较浅旧渠较深，上游失水，下游便不能浇地。因此，春节以后到现在为止，干渠两岸的地只浇了六万多亩，连上汾阳已浇的四万亩，也不过只浇了十万多亩；再加上去冬浇地的数字总共才浇到四十多万亩，比去年这时少浇二十万亩，和去冬今春计划浇一百万亩的计划相差更远，严重地妨害了防旱抗旱工作。
    这一事件发生后，山西省人民政府水利局即派工程师多人急赴决口失水地区勘查，并已决定采取以下几项紧急措施进行补救：（一）泄水闸下游的护底、护岸已被冲刷，如不能顺水泄水，对灌溉的妨碍很大。领导方面除决定在管理上分散水势减少冲刷外，并已派工程人员前往指挥整修，计划半月内修好，保证灌溉。（二）已急令汾河水利委员会增派得力干部拆除各地所架设的草木浮桥，使不妨碍水流。并发动区、村水利干部和沿渠群众，详细检查各地的渠岸裂缝、洞穴，并教育农民灌地后封口时必须揭去冻皮。（三）通知有关各县抽派干部协同汾河水利委员会跟水行浇，加强灌溉管理工作，防止再有任何决口失水现象发生。（四）通报各专区和县、各河系，特别是潇河、滹沱河等新修渠道，认真检查渠道、坝埝，加强灌溉管理工作；并在春暖冰融正好春浇的期间，迅速组织农民抓紧时机保证完成春浇任务，以弥补决口失水造成的损失。
