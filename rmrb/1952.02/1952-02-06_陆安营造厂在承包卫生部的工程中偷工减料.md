    Lu'an Construction Factory
    Skimps on Materials in Contracting Ministry of Health Project
    To the Editor: Last October, the Lu'an Construction Factory contracted to build a boiler room for the Central Ministry of Health's Drug and Food Inspection Institute. When the project progressed to the construction of the chimney flue, we told the Lu'an Construction Factory's supervisor that the lower part of the chimney needed to be made of firebricks. However, the supervisor ignored our words, and the construction factory's manager, Liu Yuping, even puffed out his chest and said, "There won't be any problems for ten years." But after the project was completed, the chimney developed a crack more than a Zhang long from the base upwards after only three days of use. On both sides of the chimney are the laboratory and library. The Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau sent people to make an assessment. They also believed that this project was too careless and decided that the Lu'an Construction Factory should be responsible for the repairs. However, more than a month has passed, and there are still no results. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, we conducted a detailed inspection of this project and found that there were acts of cutting corners and that many places were not constructed according to the engineering drawings. The Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau also does not pay enough attention to the people's property. Until now, they have not sent anyone to our institute to deal with this problem.

### 陆安营造厂在承包卫生部的工程中偷工减料

    陆安营造厂
    在承包卫生部的工程中偷工减料
    编辑同志：去年十月间，陆安营造厂承造中央卫生部药物食品检验所的锅炉房一大间。工程进行到修建烟囱火口的时候，我们曾经向陆安营造厂的监工说过：烟囱的下部，需要加用耐火砖。但是这位监工却把我们的话当作耳边风，营造厂经理刘玉璞也挺了挺胸说：“十年内不会发生问题。”但是工程落成后，只使用了三天，烟囱就从根处向上裂了一丈多长的大缝。烟囱两旁是化验室和图书馆。北京市建设局曾派人来作鉴定。他们也认为这项工程实在太马虎，决定要陆安营造厂负责修整。但是时间已经过了一个多月，还是毫无结果。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展后，我们对这一工程进行了详细检查，发现有偷工减料的行为，而且有很多地方没有按照工程的图样施工。北京市建设局方面，对人民财产也不够重视，直到现在，他们还没有派人来我所处理这个问题。
