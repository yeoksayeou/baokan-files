Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: Our front-line reporter reports: Full of victorious confidence as they entered 1952, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers achieved new victories in their defensive battles in the first month of this year, annihilating more than 11,000 enemy troops and destroying and damaging 330 enemy aircraft. During this coldest month, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies crushed the enemy's provocative attacks near the Panmunjom armistice negotiation meeting area, repelled numerous incursions by small groups of enemy troops along the 200-kilometer-long front across the Korean Peninsula, and killed and wounded many enemy troops.

Around the New Year, the enemy delayed the armistice negotiations at the Panmunjom conference table. At the same time, they created a series of provocative incidents outside the conference, such as bombing the neutral zone and strafing our delegation's vehicles. On the one hand, they drove more than two regiments of the Syngman Rhee puppet army to launch a risky offensive against our army's positions in the Jiryeongdong area, nine kilometers northeast of Panmunjom, starting on December 28 of last year, in an attempt to threaten the safety of the meeting area and the neutral zone. These adventurous activities of the enemy met with a shameful defeat. Our soldiers, who were faithfully defending the safety of the meeting area, once warned the enemy: "If you dare to use force here, you have no right to speak here!" They ruthlessly attacked the invading enemy troops and annihilated groups of enemy soldiers in front of the forward positions. The enemy troops, under the cover of aircraft, artillery, and tanks, launched a frenzied attack for twelve days, and the offensive ended in a miserable failure on January 8. In this "debate battle" clamored by the American generals, more than 2,700 Syngman Rhee puppet soldiers were sacrificed in vain, and the 12th and 15th Regiments of the 1st Division of the Rhee puppet army, which were thrown into this risky offensive, suffered heavy casualties, while our army's positions still stood firm.

On the more than 200-kilometer-long blocking front covered with snow, our army continued to defeat more enemies with fewer troops, constantly annihilating the enemy's living forces. In addition to repelling frequent attacks by small groups of enemy troops every day, our army also often took the initiative to attack with a small number of troops, stepping on thick white snow, and actively annihilated the enemy. Often in the howling wind and snow of the night, a surprise force suddenly rushed to the top of the mountain occupied by the enemy troops and annihilated the panicked enemy troops in one fell swoop. Our brave and resourceful warriors also often ambushed the invading enemy troops, killing and wounding many enemy troops on the roadside or mountain path.

Due to the strengthening of our army's anti-aircraft artillery fire and the improvement of the shooting skills of the anti-aircraft gunners, the American air force, which frantically slaughtered the peaceful people of Korea and destroyed the peaceful cities and towns of Korea, suffered even heavier blows. Even at night, American aircraft were often shot down by our army's anti-aircraft artillery fire. A spokesman for the Fifth Air Force of the American invading army had to admit that "the days when American aircraft could 'pass unhindered' in the skies of Korea are over."

During this month, the American invading army imported new military forces from outside Korea. Following the deployment of the 45th Infantry Division of the US Army to the Korean battlefield, the 40th Infantry Division of the US Army, originally stationed in Japan, was also transferred to Korea for combat this month. This is the second infantry division that the American invaders have imported into the Korean battlefield during the delay of the Korean armistice negotiations. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies, who are determined to defend peace in the East, are closely watching all the conspiratorial activities of the invaders.

The comprehensive battle results of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in January are as follows:

1.  11,155 enemy troops were killed or wounded, including 5,145 American invading troops, 247 British and Canadian accomplice troops, and 5,763 Syngman Rhee puppet troops.

2.  Captured six anti-aircraft guns, four recoilless guns, one light mortar, one 60mm mortar, five rocket launchers, four flamethrowers, one anti-aircraft machine gun, nine heavy machine guns, fifty-four light machine guns, two hundred and seventy-four automatic rifles, seventy-five carbines, twenty-three rifles, seventeen submachine guns, twenty-one pistols, three signal guns, eight rifle grenade launchers, one grenade launcher, two hundred and seventy-eight shells, one hundred and ten thousand three hundred and forty-seven bullets, one hundred and eighteen landmines, nine hundred and seventy-two hand grenades, two radios, twenty-one walkie-talkies, and six telephones.

3.  Shot down and damaged 330 enemy aircraft, including 152 enemy aircraft shot down and 178 enemy aircraft damaged; destroyed and damaged 57 enemy tanks and 35 vehicles; destroyed 12 enemy artillery pieces; and sunk 19 enemy wooden boats.

    朝中部队一月歼敌万余名
    击落击伤美国飞机三百三十架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】本社前线记者报道：满怀胜利信心迈进一九五二年的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在今年第一个月的防御战中，取得了歼灭敌军一万一千多人、毁伤敌机三百三十架的新胜利。在这个最寒冷的月份里，朝中人民军队粉碎了敌军在板门店停战谈判会场区附近的挑衅进攻，并在横亘朝鲜半岛二百多公里长的战线上，打退了小股敌军的多次进犯和杀伤了很多敌军。
    新年前后，敌人在板门店会议桌上拖延停战谈判；同时，在会外制造了一连串轰炸中立区、扫射我方代表团车辆的挑衅事件；一面又驱使李承晚伪军两个多团兵力在去年十二月二十八日开始向板门店东北九公里的智陵洞地区我军阵地冒险进攻，企图威胁会场区和中立区的安全，敌人的这些冒险活动遭到了可耻的失败。忠诚地保卫着会场区安全的我军战士们曾经警告敌人说：“你们要是敢在这里动武，这里没有你们的发言权！”他们无情地打击着进犯的敌军，把成群的敌兵歼灭在阵地前沿。敌军在飞机、大炮、战车掩护下，疯狂进攻了十二天，到一月八日进攻以悲惨的失败告终。在这次美国将军叫嚣的“争辩战”中，李承晚伪军二千七百多人白白作了牺牲品，被投入这次冒险进攻的李伪军第一师第十二、第十五两个联队遭到惨重伤亡，而我军阵地仍屹立不动。
    在大雪覆盖着的二百多公里长的阻击战线上，我军继续以少胜多，不断歼灭敌军有生力量。除每天打退小股敌军的频繁进攻外，我军并经常以人数很少的部队踏着厚厚的白雪主动出击，积极歼灭敌人。时常在风雪怒号的深夜里，一支奇兵突然冲上敌军盘据着的山头，将惊慌失措的敌军一举歼灭。英勇机智的我军勇士们也常常伏击进犯的敌军，把许多敌军打死打伤在公路旁或山道上。
    由于我军高射炮火的加强，高射炮手们射击技术的提高，使疯狂屠杀朝鲜和平人民和破坏朝鲜和平城乡的美国空军遭到了更加沉重的打击。即使在夜间，美国飞机也常被我军高射炮火所击落。美国侵略军第五航空队的发言人不得不承认：美国飞机在朝鲜天空“通行无阻的日子已经过去。”
    在这个月中，美国侵略军又从朝鲜境外输入了新的军事力量。继美军第四十五步兵师投入朝鲜战场之后，原驻日本的美军第四十步兵师也在本月被调到朝鲜作战。这是美国侵略者在拖延朝鲜停战谈判期间输入朝鲜战场的第二个步兵师。坚决保卫东方和平的朝中人民军队正密切注视着侵略者的一切阴谋活动。
    朝中人民军队在一月份作战的综合战果如下：
    一、毙伤敌军一万一千一百五十五名，其中包括美国侵略军五千一百四十五名、英国和加拿大等帮凶军二百四十七名、李伪军五千七百六十三名。
    二、缴获机关炮六门、无座力炮四门、轻迫击炮、六○炮各一门、火箭筒五个、火焰喷射器四具、高射机关枪一挺、重机枪九挺、轻机枪五十四挺、自动步枪二百七十四枝、卡宾枪七十五枝、步枪二十三枝、冲锋枪十七枝、短枪二十一枝、讯号枪三枝、枪榴筒八个、掷弹筒一个、炮弹二百七十八发、子弹一十万零三百四十七发、地雷一百一十八个、手榴弹九百七十二个、电台两部、步行机二十一部、电话机六部。
    三、击落击伤敌军飞机三百三十架，其中击落敌机一百五十二架、击伤敌机一百七十八架；击毁击伤敌军战车五十七辆、汽车三十五辆；击毁敌炮十二门；击沉敌木船十九艘。
