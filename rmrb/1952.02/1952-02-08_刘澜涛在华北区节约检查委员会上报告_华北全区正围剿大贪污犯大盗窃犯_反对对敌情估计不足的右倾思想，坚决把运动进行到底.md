Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Liu Lantao, Director of the North China Regional Thrift and Inspection Committee, delivered an important report at a recent meeting of the committee on the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in party, government, military, civilian, and academic institutions in the North China region, as well as the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence in the industrial and commercial sectors.

Liu Lantao pointed out that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the unified plan of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, the first battle (February 1st to 10th) of the general offensive against major embezzlers in the entire North China region is unfolding on an unprecedented scale, fiercely and rapidly. Many major embezzlers have been captured above the county level in the entire region. The arguments of "only waste, no corruption" and "no major corruption at the lower levels" have completely gone bankrupt. As of the 5th, Chanan Prefecture in Chahar Province had uncovered 70 major embezzlers at the prefectural level, Yangyuan County alone had uncovered 28 (including 6 who embezzled over 100 million), and Wuwei County in Pingyuan Province had uncovered 27. Good news is pouring in from all over, which is encouraging. While the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in party, government, military, civilian, and academic institutions is developing intensely, the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence in the private industrial and commercial sectors, based on the greatly increased patriotic awareness of the broad masses of people who have recognized the criminal facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the state and the people over the past three years, has also been popularized to small and medium-sized towns in the interior, led by Beijing and Tianjin. All unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists who refuse to confess have begun to receive the just judgment of the people. At this point, a favorable situation has been completely formed in the entire North China region for encircling all kinds of major embezzlers and thieves layer by layer, both internally and externally, and the high tide of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence has arrived.

After explaining the profound nature of this movement to counterattack the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie based on the large number of vivid facts that have been revealed, Liu Lantao pointed out that this great struggle must be carried through to the end, and all embezzlers, especially major embezzlers and thieves, must be thoroughly, completely, and entirely searched and captured. To this end, it is necessary to: (1) Resolutely fight against the right-leaning ideology that underestimates the enemy situation. This ideology turns a blind eye to the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie and the serious harm caused by the existence of embezzlers, especially major embezzlers – the "fortresses" set up by the bourgeoisie inside us – and is numb to it. It is necessary to seriously criticize this erroneous ideology, fully raise vigilance, and continuously exhibit the specific facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks and the serious harm of embezzlers to the country, explaining the principle of "many tigers in deep mountains and forests"; constantly introduce methods and experiences of capturing major embezzlers and thieves to strengthen fighting spirit, enhance confidence, and completely overcome the dangerous right-leaning erroneous ideology. Those cadres who have made serious mistakes and are unwilling to correct them should be decisively removed from obstacles by the leadership, or their leading organs should be partially reorganized without hesitation. (2) Make concrete plans, which is the key to capturing major embezzlers. We must stop talking empty words and see whether we are making plans based on facts and whether we have achieved results according to the plans. Even if the initial planned numbers are slightly lower, they will have a great effect, and the tasks should be added at any time according to the development of the situation. (3) There must be a strong and pure headquarters, and there must be a "tiger-catching" backbone team that has been tempered. No one should be left in the headquarters with unclean hands or who intentionally or unintentionally shelters embezzlers. Organize mass teams in a timely manner, and promptly handle the small and medium-sized embezzlers who have sincerely confessed and repented, so that they can return to the people's position and have the opportunity to atone for their crimes. (4) Pay attention to tactics, be brave and resourceful, and give full play to the initiative and creativity of the masses. (5) The end of the movement in each level and department must be approved by the higher-level leading organs. Get rid of evil completely, do not allow a major embezzler to be missed, and do not "withdraw troops" without a complete victory. Any unit that rashly "withdraws troops" and is found to have escaped major embezzlers after re-examination shall be criticized and censured by both the presenting unit and the approving unit. (6) In order to thoroughly capture all major embezzlers, we must pay attention to the diversity of the harm to the country caused by major embezzlers with more than 100 million yuan in embezzled funds. In addition to those who embezzled more than 100 million yuan personally (which is a "big tiger" that harms the country and the people), some situations are very serious, such as selling state economic intelligence; even if the personal embezzlement is less than 100 million yuan but causes state losses of more than 100 million yuan; the organizers and masterminds of collective embezzlement cases exceeding 100 million yuan; serious embezzlement (such as embezzling donations for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, deducting disaster relief grain, etc.) exceeding 50 million yuan; colluding with private merchants to steal state assets, regardless of how much money the individual obtains but the state losses are more than 100 million yuan, should all be punished as "big tigers." Among the embezzlers who have been captured, it is also necessary to thoroughly investigate and strictly prevent turning big things into small things. This situation has occurred everywhere and must be strictly reviewed. (7) In order to healthily promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, the leadership must master the steps well and make it develop in depth in a guided and planned manner. At present, it must be controlled at the county level and above, and the district and village levels should not be carried out for the time being. It should be carried out after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle at the county level and above is basically completed and there is time to spare, otherwise, a rash implementation will definitely lead to errors, and this point must be paid attention to.

Liu Lantao then pointed out that in order to finally eradicate this serious phenomenon of corruption, it is necessary to launch a resolute counterattack movement on the basis of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the state and the people (the source of corruption). That is, the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. This movement is currently breaking through all obstacles (including all the ugly, despicable, and shameless clamoring of the bourgeoisie) in the entire North China region and is resolutely and healthily developing forward. More and more bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence confession and reporting conferences or broadcast conferences are being held in Beijing, Tianjin, and small and medium-sized towns in the interior, and the reporting movement of the broad masses of workers, shop assistants, staff, and citizens is being widely carried out. Complaint letters are pouring in like snowflakes. For example, Tianjin City has received more than 160,000 pieces of confession and reporting materials, Beijing City has received 150,000 pieces, and shop assistants in Xinxiang City, Pingyuan Province, have reported 2,000 cases in eight days. All localities have formed inspection groups or combat teams with cadres and activists who have been trained in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, who are familiar with the various methods of unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists, and who have mastered a large amount of material (and many small and medium-sized embezzlers who have already confessed and repented and are determined to counterattack unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists) and sworn an oath to launch inspections. A few unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists who refuse to confess have fallen into the hands of the people's courts. The materials from the initial launch of the battle have fully exposed the criminal facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the state and the people over the past three years, brightening the eyes of the people. According to the preliminary and extremely incomplete settlement in Tianjin, unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen have evaded and evaded more than 800 billion yuan in state taxes alone since liberation, which is equivalent to the total amount of public grain paid to the state by farmers in the entire Pingyuan province in one year. Other towns and cities have similar situations. The embezzlement of cadres in the local work cadres, whose embezzlement behaviors are caused by the bourgeoisie's corruption and seduction, that is, those who are injured by the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets," accounts for more than 80% to 90%, and there are no exceptions for major embezzlers. According to preliminary materials from the Taiyuan City Tax Bureau, the total amount of embezzlement and bribery by cadres is 200 million yuan, while the unscrupulous merchants have evaded and evaded taxes by 10 billion yuan. Many unscrupulous merchants use despicable and lowly methods such as treating guests, giving gifts (even sending baby diapers), watching operas, gambling, drug addiction, and female color (even sending their own wives) to drag people into the water. For example, Du Xingcan, manager of the Huimin Hardware Store, a large unscrupulous merchant in Taiyuan City, corrupted more than 70 of our cadres, involving 36 enterprises, institutions, and units; among the 15 cadres in the Xinxiang Purchasing Station of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in Pingyuan Province, 13 were corrupted by unscrupulous merchants Zhang Zhuchuan, etc., and unscrupulous merchants Zhang Zhuchuan, etc. defrauded the state of more than 400 million yuan. Xu Qiucheng, an unscrupulous merchant in Changzhi Town, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province
    (born to a landlord), has admitted to bribing cadres to steal state assets to the tune of 1.1 billion yuan. The unscrupulous merchant used a small amount of the stolen "relief" to "disaster victims" in his native village, and in turn asked the masses: "In the past, you struggled against me and said that the Communist Party was good. Why don't they give you millet now?" In various places, many spies and informants who were sent by the bourgeoisie into our state enterprises and institutions to engage in theft and sabotage activities have been reported, and those with serious crimes have been arrested. For example, Zhang Yue, who infiltrated our Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau Construction Section to serve as a technician, also served as the chairman of the Taiyuan Private Xiangji (founded by war criminal Kong Xiangxi, hence the name Xiangji) Construction Factory. He used his authority to steal economic intelligence, contract projects with shoddy workmanship and materials, steal more than 500 million yuan in state assets, and corrupt 23 of our cadres. This kind of spy and informant sent by the bourgeoisie into our state organs and economic departments, like a blood vessel, is unlimitedly harming our country's construction cause. It should be especially pointed out that some capitalists, under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, have made money and gained political status, but they do not use this to engage in legitimate economic activities in a disciplined manner, but instead use these to frantically attack the state and the people with ingratitude. For example, Wang Maoxun (former member of the Henan Provincial People's Government), chairman of the private shares of the Huaxin Textile Factory in Pingyuan Province, Wang Xinpu, executive director and acting manager, and Chen Yunong, vice chairman, colluded with unscrupulous capitalists such as Zhu Guanghua in Shanghai to buy and sell short and set up a fraudulent scheme, causing the state to lose tens of billions of yuan in funds. Unscrupulous capitalists hide their shady criminal behavior under the guise of "legality." This fact has been discovered in many places. This is the struggle of the Chinese bourgeoisie to compete with the working class for leadership in many departments, many enterprises, and many regions. The Chinese bourgeoisie cannot use the method of open competition to fight against the working class. They adopt a hidden method, which is to weaken and control the state-owned economy from within the state-owned economy. In order to achieve this shameful goal, they can use any means, attack from the inside, pull over to their side, and use all means.

Liu Lantao finally emphasized that the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence must be carried through to the end, to a thorough and complete victory. We must oppose right-leaning emotions and never allow wavering. Those places that have not yet entered the battle should enter the battle within February. We must achieve significant results in the second half of February and greater results in March to cooperate with and consolidate the great victory on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy front. Because the ugly face of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks has been fully and extensively exposed in the movement, and the patriotic awareness of the broad masses of people and their vigilance against unscrupulous merchants have been greatly improved, recognizing that launching the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence is a very important and urgent political task at present, therefore, the development of the movement will be very rapid. The leadership must pay close attention to fully mobilizing the broad masses of workers, shop assistants, staff, and people from all walks of life; pay attention to strengthening the class education of cadres and the training of combat teams; pay attention to awakening those who have been injured by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets and have now sincerely repented and are willing to stand on the side of the people again, so that they can join this battle and have the opportunity to atone for their crimes; pay attention to uniting the more upright industrialists and businessmen in the industrial and commercial circles and those who, even if they have problems, can quickly and sincerely confess and repent to the government, stand on the side of the people's government and the Common Program, and draw a clear line with the few illegal or unrepentant elements, so as to form a powerful and effective united front against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, and immediately launch a counterattack against a few unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists. Resolutely implement the policy of "those who violate the law must be dealt with, those who resist will be severely punished, those who confess voluntarily will be treated leniently, and those who report meritorious service will be rewarded." Clearly draw the line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, resolutely refute all the ugly, despicable, and shameless clamoring of the bourgeoisie, and continuously and repeatedly explain the justice of this battle to cadres and the masses of the people. All legitimate patriotic industrialists and businessmen and their legitimate profits should be protected; all illegal acts of unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists must be eradicated. Those who do not confess their crimes to the people, repent, and start anew, the people must immediately rise up and severely punish them politically and economically, forcing them to submit, and they must not be allowed to escape by chance.

    刘澜涛在华北区节约检查委员会上报告
    华北全区正围剿大贪污犯大盗窃犯
    反对对敌情估计不足的右倾思想，坚决把运动进行到底
    【新华社七日讯】华北区节约检查委员会在最近召开会议，在这个会议上，华北区节约检查委员会主任刘澜涛就目前华北区党政军民学各单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，和工商界的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争进行情况，作了重要的报告。
    刘澜涛指出：华北全区在毛主席的英明领导和中共中央华北局的统一计划下，向大贪污犯发起总进攻的第一个战役（二月一日至十日以前），正以空前巨大的规模，猛烈、迅速地展开中。全区县以上已捕获大贪污犯多名。“只有浪费没有贪污”，“下边无大贪污”的论调完全破产了。截至五日止，察哈尔省察南专区一级已查获大贪污犯七十个，阳原一县即查获二十八个（内贪污一亿以上的六个），平原省武陟县查获二十七个。各地捷报纷至沓来，令人振奋。和党政军民学各单位反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争激剧深入开展的同时，在广大人民认清了资产阶级三年来向国家和人民猖狂进攻的罪恶事实，因而爱国觉悟大大提高的基础上，在私人工商界中的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动亦已由北京、天津两市带头，先后普及到内地各中小市镇。一切拒不坦白的奸商和不法资本家，都开始受到人民的正义的裁判。至此，华北全区对于各种大贪污犯和大盗窃犯实行层层包围、内外夹攻的有利形势已经完全形成，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的高潮已经到来。
    刘澜涛在根据已被揭发的大量生动的事实，说明这一运动的深刻的反击资产阶级猖狂进攻的性质以后，指出：必须将这一伟大的斗争进行到底，务将所有贪污分子特别是大贪污犯和大盗窃犯干脆、彻底、全部搜捕净尽，为此必须：（一）坚决向对敌情估计不足的右倾思想作斗争，这种思想就是对资产阶级向我猖狂进攻和贪污分子特别是大贪污犯——资产阶级安设在我们内部的“堡垒”——存在的严重危害性熟视无睹，麻木不仁。要严肃批判这种错误思想，充分提起警惕；不断展览资产阶级猖狂进攻与贪污分子严重危害国家的罪恶具体事实，说明“山大林深虎多”的道理；不断介绍捕捉大贪污犯和大盗窃犯的方法和经验，以加强斗志，提高信心，彻底克服那种危险的右倾错误思想。干部中犯错误严重而又不愿改正者，应由领导方面迅速做出决定，坚决撤掉障碍，或局部改组其领导机关，不可迟疑不决。（二）做出具体计划，这是捕捉大贪污犯的要诀。必须停止讲空话，看是否实事求是地做计划和是否按计划取得了成绩。初期计划数字即使稍低，作用也大，应视情况发展，随时追加任务。（三）要有坚强而纯洁的指挥部，要有经过锻炼的“捉虎”基干队。指挥部中不许留有手面不净或有意无意包庇贪污犯的分子。及时组织群众队伍，及时处理已经真诚坦白改悔的中小贪污分子，使其回到人民立场，有立功赎罪的机会。（四）注意战术，有勇有谋，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性。（五）各级各部门结束运动必须经过上级领导机关批准。除恶务尽，不准漏掉一个大贪污犯，不全胜不准“收兵”。凡草率“收兵”经复查有漏网的大贪污犯者，呈请的单位和批准的单位均应受到批评和指责。（六）为彻底捉尽大贪污犯，必须注意贪污一亿元以上的大贪污犯危害国家的多样性。除了个人贪污一亿元以上者（这是危害国家及人民的“大老虎”）外，有些情节十分严重，如出卖国家经济情报、个人贪污虽不满一亿元但造成国家损失超过一亿元以上者；超过一亿元的集体贪污案的组织者、主谋者；性质严重的贪污（如侵吞抗美援朝捐款、克扣救灾粮等）超过五千万元以上者；勾结私商共同盗窃国家资财、不管本人得钱多少但国家损失在一亿元以上者，均应以“大老虎”惩处。目前已捕获的贪污犯中，亦必须追查彻底，严防以大化小，这种情形已到处发生，必须严格审查。（七）为了健康地推进反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，领导上必须掌握好步骤，使之有领导、有计划地深入发展。目前必须控制在县一级以上，区村两级一律暂不进行。待县以上各级反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争基本结束腾出手来后再搞，否则，草率进行一定发生错误，此点必须加以注意。
    刘澜涛接着指出要最后铲除这种严重贪污的罪恶现象，必须在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的基础上正面地向资产阶级对国家和人民的猖狂进攻
    （贪污腐化现象的渊薮），展开一个坚决的反击运动，即反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动。这个运动目前在华北全区正突破一切障碍（包括资产阶级一切丑恶的卑鄙无耻的叫嚣），坚决地健康地向前发展中。北京、天津和内地各中小城镇召开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报坦白检举大会或广播大会者越来越多，广大工人、店员、职员和市民群众的检举运动正广泛开展，检举信件如雪片飞来。如天津市坦白检举材料达十六万余件，北京市达十五万件，平原省新乡市店员八天中即检举了二千件。各地都以反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中受过训练的、熟知奸商和不法资本家各种手段并掌握大量材料的干部和积极分子（尚有不少业已坦白改悔、决心向奸商和不法资本家反击的中小贪污分子）组成检查组或战斗队，宣誓出动，展开检查。少数拒不坦白的奸商和不法资本家已落入人民法庭之手。仅初步发动战斗的材料，已充分暴露了资产阶级三年来向国家和人民猖狂进攻的罪恶事实，擦亮了人民的眼睛。天津市初步极不完全的结算，解放以来不法工商业家仅偷漏国税一项，即达八千亿元以上，等于平原全省农民一年中向国家所缴的公粮总数，其他各市镇均有类此情况。各地工作干部中的贪污分子其贪污行为出于资产阶级腐蚀勾引即被资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”击伤者，均在百分之八十至九十以上，大贪污犯更无一例外。太原市税局初步材料，干部贪污受贿总数为二亿元，而奸商由此偷漏税款则达百亿元以上。许多奸商用请客、送礼（直至送小孩尿布）、看戏、赌博、吸毒、女色（直至送上自己的老婆）等卑劣下贱办法拉人下水。如太原市大奸商惠民五金行经理杜星灿，腐蚀我干部七十余人，涉及企业、机关单位三十六个；平原省焦作矿务局新乡采购站十五个干部中，即有十三个为奸商张珠川等所腐蚀，奸商张珠川等从中诈骗国家资财达四亿余元。山西长治专区所属长治镇奸商徐秋成
    （地主出身），行贿干部盗窃国家资财已承认者达十一亿元之巨，该奸商以所盗窃的一小点“救济”原籍村“灾民”，即反过来问群众：“过去你们斗争我，说共产党好，为什么现在不给你们小米？”资产阶级派进我国家企业、机关内从事盗窃破坏活动的奸细、坐探，各地已检举出不少，罪恶重大者已经落网。如打入我太原铁路分局建筑段充任技术员的张悦，兼任太原私营祥记（战犯孔祥熙所办，故名祥记）营造厂董事长，利用职权盗窃经济情报，承包工程偷工减料，盗窃国家资财达五亿元以上，并腐蚀我干部二十三人。此种被资产阶级派入我国家机关和经济部门的奸细、坐探，如同吸血管一样，无限制地损害着我们国家的建设事业。特别要指出的是，有些资本家在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，赚了钱，有了政治地位，他们不因此循规蹈矩从事正当经济事业，反利用这些忘恩负义地向国家和人民猖狂进攻。如平原省华新纱厂私股董事长王懋询（曾任河南省人民政府委员）、常务董事兼代经理王欣甫、副董事长陈韵浓等，勾结上海不法资本家朱光华等，买空卖空，伙设骗局，使国家损失资金达数十亿元之巨。不法资本家在“合法”的帽子下，掩藏其见不得人的犯罪行为，这种事实各地已经发现不少了。这就是中国资产阶级在许多部门、许多企业、许多地区中企图和工人阶级争夺领导权的斗争。中国资产阶级不可能用公开争夺的办法来和工人阶级作斗争，他们采用的是暗藏的办法，就是从国营经济内部来削弱和控制国营经济。为了达到这个可耻的目的，他们可以不择手段，打进来，拉过去，无所不用其极。
    刘澜涛最后着重指出：必须把反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争进行到底，进行到彻底的全部的胜利。必须反对右倾情绪，决不允许动摇。有的地方还没有进入战斗的，应在二月份内进入战斗。必须在二月份下半月取得显著成绩，三月份取得更大成绩，以配合和巩固反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义战线上的伟大胜利。由于资产阶级猖狂进攻的丑恶面目已在运动中充分大量地暴露出来，广大人民群众的爱国觉悟和对奸商的警惕性已大大提高，认识到展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争是当前十分重要和十分紧迫的政治任务，因此，运动的开展会是很迅速的。领导上必须严密注意充分发动广大工人、店员、职员和各界人民群众；注意加强干部的阶级教育和战斗队伍的训练；注意唤醒那些被资产阶级糖衣炮弹击伤而今天已经真诚改悔愿意重新站到人民方面来的分子，使他们投入这场战斗，有立功赎罪的机会；注意团结工商界中比较正派的工商业者和即使有毛病但能很快向政府真诚坦白改悔的分子，站到人民政府和共同纲领方面，和少数违法或拒不改悔的分子划清界限，以组成一支强大有力的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报统一战线，立即向少数奸商和不法资本家展开反击。坚定地执行违法者必办、抗拒者重办、自动坦白者从宽、检举有功者受奖的政策。明确划清工人阶级与资产阶级之间的界限，坚决驳掉资产阶级一切丑恶的卑鄙无耻的叫嚣，不断地反复地向干部和人民群众讲清这场战斗的正义性。一切正当的爱国的工商业者及其所获的正当利润应当保护；一切奸商和不法资本家的不法行为必须铲除。其有不向人民坦白认罪、改悔自新者，人民群众就必须立即起来从政治上经济上予以严厉惩办，迫其就范，决不可让他们侥幸地溜过去。
