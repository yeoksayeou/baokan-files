In the anti-corruption, anti-bribery movement, currently underway in various state-owned and private enterprises, is an intense struggle of the working class against the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. The victory or defeat of this struggle depends on whether the leadership resolutely relies on the working masses, and whether the working masses are fully mobilized. Facts have proven that the full mobilization of the working masses requires arduous work, especially for those workers who are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, the propaganda departments of the Party must, in this movement, attach great importance to the class education of the working masses, clear away the influence of bourgeois ideology on them, and strive to raise their class consciousness. Only in this way can the working masses be truly and fully mobilized, and can the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement achieve a complete victory.

According to recent information, since the beginning of the movement, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the trade unions, both in state-owned and private enterprises, workers have received varying degrees of education through various mobilization meetings, representative conferences, grievance sessions, forums, and training classes. Workers in state-owned enterprises have organized "tiger-hunting teams" and uncovered many corrupt elements and bourgeois spies sent into state-owned enterprises. Clerks and staff in private enterprises have bravely reported a large number of lawless capitalists. In Beijing alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 21,000 cases have been reported by shop assistants in just over a month. Active workers are joining their own organizations in large numbers. Traitors inside the trade union, planted by capitalists, are beginning to be purged. The trade union grassroots organizations are showing a vigorous atmosphere.

However, it must also be admitted that, during this period, our propaganda and education work for workers, in many enterprises and departments, still only remained at the level of explaining policies and simple agitation and propaganda. It has not been able to adapt to the needs of the movement to thoroughly solve some of the fundamental problems existing in the minds of workers, and to achieve the purpose of deeply mobilizing the working masses ideologically. For example, in state-owned enterprises, although workers have already recognized the odiousness of corrupt elements in their factories from the struggle of "hunting tigers," they do not yet understand why this is the bourgeoisie's attack on the working class. In state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature, workers often do not feel the struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie very directly; they do not easily connect the anti-corruption struggle in a factory with the nationwide class struggle. Solving these ideological problems cannot be accomplished by simple agitation and propaganda, but must seize the opportunity in the movement to conduct a more in-depth class education for them. In conducting this education, workers should be told that in the new China led by the working class, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class has not been eliminated or eased, but has intensified. The purpose of the bourgeoisie's attack on state-owned enterprises is to try to undermine state-owned enterprises and drag the people's China onto the capitalist road. Workers today do a good job in state-owned enterprises, preventing capitalists from destroying state-owned enterprises, which is to lay the material foundation for China's path to socialism. After such class education, every worker in a state-owned enterprise will consciously feel a responsibility: the Chinese working class is the class that determines China's destiny, and every worker should actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and should greet the large-scale increase production and thrift movement with a high spirit of work and creativity. In private enterprises, the vast number of workers, shop assistants, and staff, because they have long been politically and economically oppressed and exploited by capitalists in the past, and many shop assistants are relatives and friends of capitalists, coupled with the fact that some staff members (accountants, outside runners) still dream of becoming bosses and taking the capitalist road. Therefore, their ideological problems in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence are more complicated than those of workers in state-owned enterprises. They cannot tear themselves away from the capitalists because they are afraid of retaliation, dismissal, and unemployment. These ideological concerns are obstacles to their active struggle against lawless capitalists. Therefore, their class education must be strengthened to remove these concerns. In conducting this education, workers should be made to understand that workers, shop assistants, and capitalists are two classes with completely different interests, and should clearly draw a line between them, and should never blur the class line because of personal relationships; at the same time, the working class and the bourgeoisie are classes with two different futures, only the working class is a class with a great future, and the bourgeoisie is a class that is about to enter the museum, and those who are still dreaming of becoming bosses and taking the capitalist road now have no future. Only on the basis of this class education can workers, shop assistants, and staff stand firm on the position of the working class, actively engage in face-to-face struggles with lawless capitalists, and in the future, as state leaders, supervise capitalists and continue to struggle against lawless bourgeois elements. In short, regardless of workers in state-owned enterprises or shop assistants and staff in private enterprises, only after a more in-depth class education is conducted for them can their class consciousness be fundamentally raised, so that they can consciously carry out the struggle against bourgeois attacks.

In more than a month of the movement, due to the shortcomings that still exist in our propaganda and education work, and some departments have also relaxed propaganda and education work, lawless bourgeois elements still have the opportunity to continue to paralyze workers, divide workers, and buy off workers in the movement, and continue to spread bad influences on the working class ideologically. The reasons for these shortcomings, in addition to the fact that the movement is proceeding too quickly and propaganda and education work cannot keep up for a while, are also due to the fact that the propaganda and education departments of our Party and trade unions have only paid attention to "tiger hunting" in this movement, and have neglected the importance of conducting in-depth class education for the working class. In the current movement, it is completely correct to concentrate the main force on "tiger hunting"; however, after the "tiger hunting" has progressed to a certain stage, giving appropriate attention to the political education of workers is not only completely correct, but also possible. If we do not seize the opportunity to carry out this education during the movement or after the climax of the movement, we will inevitably lose a very favorable opportunity to improve the consciousness of the working class, which is completely undesirable. Therefore, relevant departments should immediately attach importance to this work and begin to deploy it. Naturally, on the other hand, it is also wrong to attempt to conduct purely systematic education away from the current actual movement, and not to closely integrate ideological education with actual work.

In order to meet the needs of conducting this education, the propaganda and education departments of local Party committees and trade unions, in addition to paying attention to promoting the progress of this work, should also pay attention to combining with the local workers' thinking and compiling some easy-to-understand propaganda and education materials for workers to read or use as teaching materials, which is also completely necessary.

### 在反贪污反行贿斗争中必须加强工人的阶级教育

    在反贪污反行贿斗争中必须加强工人的阶级教育
    泽然
    反贪污、反行贿的运动，目前正在各国营企业、各私营企业中紧张进行。这是工人阶级反对资产阶级猖狂进攻的一场剧烈的斗争。这一斗争的胜负，取决于领导方面是否坚决依靠工人群众，是否充分发动工人群众。事实证明：工人群众的充分发动是需要经过艰苦的工作的，而那些受资产阶级思想影响较深的工人，则更是如此。因此，党的宣传部门，在这次运动中，必须十分重视工人群众的阶级教育，扫清资产阶级思想对他们的影响，努力提高他们的阶级觉悟。只有这样，工人群众才能真正充分发动起来，才能使反贪污、反行贿运动取得彻底胜利。
    根据最近了解的情况，自运动开始以来，无论国营企业或私营企业中的工人，在共产党和工会的领导下，在实际斗争中，通过各种动员大会、代表会议、诉苦会、座谈会以及训练班等方式，已受到了程度不同的教育，国营企业的工人，组织了“打虎队”，查出了许多贪污分子和资产阶级派进国营企业的坐探；私营企业中的店员和职员，勇敢地检举了大批不法资本家。仅北京一地的不完全统计，一个多月来，店员检举案件即达二万一千余件。运动中的工人积极分子，大量涌进工人自己的组织，资本家打进工会内部的工贼，开始被清洗出去，工会基层组织呈现一片蓬勃气象。
    但是，也应当承认，在这一时期中，我们对工人的宣传教育工作，在许多地区的企业和部门中，还只停留在讲解政策和简单的鼓动宣传上，还不能适应运动的需要做到比较彻底的去解决工人思想中存在着的一些根本性质的问题，达到从思想上深入发动工人群众的目的。比如在国营企业里，工人们虽然从“打虎”的斗争中已经认识了本厂贪污分子的可恶，但他们却还不了解为什么这就是资产阶级向工人阶级的进攻；在社会主义性质的国营企业里，工人们对于工人阶级和资产阶级的斗争，感觉常常不是很直接的；他们不容易把一个工厂中的反贪污斗争和全国规模的阶级斗争联系起来。解决这些思想问题，决不是简单的鼓动宣传所能完成的，而必须在运动中，抓紧时机，对他们进行比较深入的阶级教育。在进行这种教育时，应该告诉工人：在工人阶级领导的新中国，资产阶级和工人阶级的斗争并不是消灭了、缓和了，而是加剧了。资产阶级向国营企业进攻的目的，就是企图搞垮国营企业，把人民中国拖向资本主义的道路上去。工人们今天搞好国营企业，不让资本家来破坏国营企业，就是打下中国走向社会主义的物质基础。每个国营企业的工人，经过这样的阶级教育以后，就会自觉地感到一种责任：中国工人阶级是决定中国命运的阶级，每个工人都应积极起来参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，并应以高度的工作精神和创造性，来迎接大规模的增产节约运动。在私营企业中，广大的工人、店员和职员，由于过去在政治上、经济上长期受着资本家的压迫和剥削，许多店员又是资本家的亲戚和朋友，加之一部分职员（会计、跑外）还梦想着当老板、走资本主义的道路。因此，他们在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争中，思想问题比起国营企业的工人来，就更加复杂。他们和资本家撕不破脸，因为怕报复、解雇和失业。这些思想顾虑是他们积极起来和不法资本家斗争的障碍。因此，必须加强他们的阶级教育，以解除这些顾虑。在进行这种教育时，应该使工人懂得：工人、店员和资本家是利害关系完全不同的两个阶级，应当清楚地划清界限，绝不能因为个人亲友关系而模糊了阶级界限；同时，工人阶级和资产阶级又是具有两种不同前途的阶级，只有工人阶级才是具有远大前途的阶级，而资产阶级则是快进博物馆的阶级了，那些现在还在梦想当老板、走资本主义道路的人，是没有前途的。只有在这种阶级教育的基础上，才能使工人、店员和职员站稳工人阶级的立场，积极地去和不法资本家展开面对面的斗争，在今后又以国家领导者的资格去监督资本家，继续和不法资产阶级分子斗争。总之，不管国营企业的工人和私营企业的店员和职员，只有向他们进行了比较深入的阶级教育之后，才能从根本上提高他们的阶级觉悟，使他们自觉地去进行反对资产阶级进攻的斗争。
    在一个多月的运动中，由于我们宣传教育工作还存在着缺点，而且有些部门对宣传教育工作也有些放松，这就使得不法资产阶级分子在运动中仍有可能继续麻痹工人，分化工人和收买工人，继续从思想上对工人阶级散布恶劣的影响。这些缺点产生的原因，除了由于运动进行得太快，宣传教育工作有一时赶不上去的情形以外；还由于我们党和工会的宣教部门在这一运动中，只注意了“打虎”工作，而忽略了对工人阶级进行深入的阶级教育的重要性。在目前运动中，集中主要力量“打虎”是完全正确的；但是，在“打虎”进行到一定阶段之后，对工人的政治教育给予适当的注意，不仅完全是应该的而且也是可能的。如果我们在运动中或运动高潮之后，也不抓紧时机进行这种教育，必然使工人阶级觉悟的提高失去一个极有利的机会，这是完全不应该的。因此，有关部门应该立即重视这一工作，并着手布置进行。自然，另一方面，如果企图离开当前实际运动去单纯地搞系统教育、不把思想教育和实际工作密切结合起来的作法也是不对的。
    为了适应进行这种教育的需要，各地党委、工会的宣教部门，除了注意推动这一工作的进行外，还应该注意结合当地工人思想，编写一些通俗易懂的宣传教育材料，供给工人阅读或作为讲授教材，也是完全必要的。
