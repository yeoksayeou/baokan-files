Comrades must remember the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance by the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union on February 14, 1950. That world-shaking event is now two years old.

The spirit of friendship between China and the Soviet Union is growing day by day, and the friendly relations between the two great nations are increasing day by day.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is simple and clear, with only six articles. The first article clearly states the goal, the object, and the method. It states: "The two contracting parties undertake jointly to endeavor to take all necessary measures to prevent the resumption of aggression and disruption of peace on the part of Japan or any other state that may collaborate with Japan directly or indirectly in acts of aggression." The preamble of the treaty also states the fundamental goal of this treaty, which is "to consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and throughout the world."

I would first like to draw your attention to one point: the article mentions "Japan" and "any state that may collaborate with Japan." The first to be alarmed after the treaty was announced was American imperialism. A great commotion immediately arose in Washington. A Washington telegram on February 15, 1950, the day after the treaty was announced, stated: "American officials believe that the 'state related to Japan' mentioned in the article clearly refers to the United States." This is called "a guilty conscience," or "an admission without being pressed."

Comrades! The guilty are always afraid. The reason for the American imperialists' fear is very clear. American imperialism had long ago set its invasion plans. Less than five months after the treaty was signed, American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea and occupied our territory of Taiwan. The target of this war of aggression was clearly our People's Republic of China. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance shows that our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, foresaw the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism long ago.

The vicious anti-China policy of American imperialism had already been clearly confessed by American imperialism itself in the White Paper on Sino-American Relations published in Washington on August 5, 1949, and in Acheson's letter to Truman. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been driven out of the mainland by the People's Liberation Army. This treaty between China and the Soviet Union straightforwardly exposed the conspiracy of American imperialism to rearm Japan. This is the reason for the American imperialists' panic.

Aggression against Korea and occupation of Taiwan are predetermined conspiracies of American imperialism. Rearming Japan is also a predetermined conspiracy of American imperialism. However, we foresaw these conspiracies long ago, and we firmly believe that imperialism can be defeated and that the power of the people is invincible. The Korean War will certainly be resolved peacefully according to the will of the people. Our territory of Taiwan will certainly be recovered.

The powerful Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in the war to resist America and aid Korea, have achieved great victories. The American imperialists' attempt to rearm Japan to invade our country and disrupt peace in the Far East and the world will inevitably end in a tragic failure from the perspective of American imperialism. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has already laid the foundation. This treaty has clearly played a great role in our victory and in safeguarding world peace.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and the military victories of the Chinese and Korean people, naturally encouraged the vast majority of progressive and patriotic people in Japan, and also naturally encouraged the people of Southeast Asia who love independence, democracy, and peace. In the face of the great power of the people, all imperialist aggressors, whether American, British, or French, have appeared utterly defeated.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty also states: "The two contracting parties further declare that they are ready to participate, in a spirit of sincere cooperation, in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security and will make their full contribution to the speedy realization of these aims." These words have given spiritual encouragement to all peace-loving people around the world and to those nations that have suffered from imperialist threats or even open aggression. Now, the people of Iran, Tunisia, and Egypt have risen up to fight against imperialism and their traitors. I believe that all oppressed nations in the world will, in the future, under the encouragement of this treaty, rely on their own efforts to seek a new and bright road and no longer endure imperialist aggression.

Since the signing of the treaty between China and the Soviet Union, peace in the Far East has been guaranteed, and New China has been able to properly rectify its internal affairs. Finance and economy have been unified. Prices have been stabilized. Land reform is about to be completed. Counter-revolutionaries have been largely eliminated. Now, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been launched. Everything is proceeding steadily and in an orderly manner. It can be seen that the signing of the treaty between China and the Soviet Union has also clearly played a significant role in the rapid progress of New China's construction.

Comrades! We must know that socialism and communism are the most ideal paradise for the whole world and all mankind. The great Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union is wisely leading the Soviet people and the people of the world. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward the New Democracy, creating a broad road for China to move towards socialism and communism. These are not only deeply accepted by the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union, but will also win the sincere welcome of the whole world and all mankind. The unity of the 700 million people of the two great nations has been fixed in the form of a national treaty in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Its influence will not be limited to China and the Soviet Union, nor to the Far East, but will surely become the cornerstone of peace for the whole world and all mankind. Its influence, on this second anniversary, has already been seen to have developed to such a great extent, and its contribution to the whole world and all mankind will surely become greater year by year.

### 中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结二周年

    中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结二周年
    黄炎培
    同志们一定记得一九五○年二月十四日中苏两大国订立友好同盟互助条约。那一件震动全球的大事，到现在已经两周年了。
    中苏两大国的友爱精神在一天一天发挥着，中苏两大国的友好关系在一天一天增进着。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约简单明了只有六大条，劈头第一条就把目标、对象和方法交代得明明白白。它说：“双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平”；在条约的前言里还说明了这个条约的基本目标，就是“巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全”。
    我首先请同志们注意一点：条文里说到“日本”和“与日本相勾结的任何国家”。条约公布之后，首先感到惊慌的，就是美国帝国主义。华盛顿方面立刻起了很大的骚动。条约公布的第二天，一九五○年二月十五日，华盛顿电报上说：美国官员认为条文所说“与日本有关的国家，显然是指美国。”这叫做“做贼心虚”，也可以叫做“不打自招”。
    同志们！做贼的总是心虚的。美帝国主义心虚的原因，是很明白的。美国帝国主义老早就定下了侵略计划。在条约签订不满五个月，美国帝国主义就发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争，和侵占了我国的领土台湾，这个侵略战争的目标，显然是指向我们中华人民共和国的。中苏友好同盟互助条约的订立，表示我们中苏两国老早预见到美国帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    美国帝国主义的毒辣的对华政策，早已在一九四九年八月五日华盛顿发表的中美关系白皮书和艾奇逊给杜鲁门信中，由美帝国主义自己供认得明明白白了。蒋介石匪帮已经被人民解放军赶出大陆了。中苏这个条约很干脆地把美国帝国主义重新武装日本这一种阴谋诡计又揭穿了。这就是美国帝国主义惊慌的原因。
    侵略朝鲜和侵占台湾，是美国帝国主义预定的阴谋。重新武装日本也是美国帝国主义预定的阴谋。但是，对于这些阴谋，我们是老早有了预见的，我们坚决相信，帝国主义是一定可以战胜的，人民的力量是无敌的。朝鲜战争一定会依照人民的志愿，得到和平解决。我们的领土台湾，一定会收复回来。
    强大的中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝中间，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，取得了伟大的胜利。美国帝国主义者妄想重新武装日本来侵略我国，破坏远东和世界的和平，结果从美帝国主义说来，也一定是悲惨的失败。中苏友好同盟互助条约，已经打下基础了。对于我们的胜利，对于保障世界和平，这个条约显然都起了伟大的作用。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约，和中朝人民的军事胜利，很自然地鼓舞了日本绝大多数前进的爱国的人民，同时又很自然地鼓舞了东南亚各民族爱好独立、爱好民主、爱好和平的人民。在伟大的人民的力量面前，一切帝国主义侵略者，不论是美国、英国、法国，都已显得狼狈不堪了。
    中苏条约还载明：“双方并宣布，愿以忠诚的合作精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之迅速实现充分贡献其力量”。这几句话，对全世界爱好和平的人民和遭受到帝国主义威胁甚至公然侵略的这些民族，都给予以精神上的鼓励。现在呢，伊朗人民，突尼斯人民，埃及人民，都起来与帝国主义和它们的卖国贼进行斗争了。我相信世界上所有被压迫民族，今后都将在这个条约精神鼓励之下，靠它们自己的努力，去寻求新的光明大道，不再忍受帝国主义的侵略。
    自从中苏订约，远东的和平有了保证，新中国才得好好地修明内政。财经统一了。物价稳定了。土地改革快要完成了。反革命分子大体肃清了。到现在，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开了。从从容容地一件一件稳步进行。可以看出中苏的订约，还对于新中国建设事业的飞速进步，显然起了很大的作用。
    同志们！咱们必须知道社会主义共产主义，是全世界全人类最理想的乐园，有伟大的苏联斯大林大元帅，英明地领导着苏联人民和全世界人民，有中国共产党毛泽东主席提出新民主主义，为中国造成了走向社会主义、共产主义的康庄大道。这些不但为中苏两大国七万万人民所深深地接受，同时也将获致全世界全人类的竭诚欢迎。两大国七万万人民的团结，在中苏友好同盟互助条约里，以国家条约的形式固定下来了。它的影响，将不限于中苏两国，也不限于远东，定将成为全世界全人类的和平础石；它的影响，在今天第二周年，已看出它发展到这般远大，今后它对全世界全人类的贡献，定将一年比一年更加远大。（二月十一日在中央人民广播电台广播）
