    Shanghai Shop Assistants Welcome the Volunteer Army and Korean People's Representatives
    Guarantee to Implement the Anti-Theft Struggle to Support the Front Lines
    Shop Assistants in Shanghai, Chongqing, Jinan and Other Cities Accept Challenge from Tianjin Shop Assistants
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: On the fifteenth, Shanghai shop assistants held a grand meeting to welcome the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Visiting Delegation to China, East China Branch. Four thousand shop assistant representatives unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the high patriotism and indomitable fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, to completely crush the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. The meeting passed a resolution to accept the "Tiger Hunting" challenge from Tianjin shop assistants and issued a challenge to shop assistants nationwide.

    At the meeting, Han Xiya, vice chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees Union, said in his speech: Just as the people of the whole country are enthusiastically launching the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, those greedy merchants are using rotten beef and rotten fish to fill cans meant for the Volunteer Army, skimping on materials in many aid-Korea material processing orders, and even shamelessly embezzling huge sums of money intended for the Volunteer Army to purchase medicine. Regarding these conscienceless capitalists, Shanghai shop assistants are learning the fighting spirit of the Chinese and Korean heroic soldiers to launch an increasingly fierce struggle against them. On behalf of all shop assistants in the city, Han Xiya guaranteed to the delegation: We are determined to support the front lines with the complete victory of the struggle against bribery, against tax evasion, against theft and embezzlement of state property, against shoddy workmanship and reduced materials, and against theft of state economic intelligence.

    Li Xuesan, head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, revealed the unscrupulous crimes of the merchants who harmed the Volunteer Army in his speech. He said that the merchants sold rubber shoes made with shoddy workmanship to the Volunteer Army, and the soldiers could not walk ten miles in them before they broke. Many soldiers suffered from diarrhea after eating bad canned food. Because of the fake and bad medicine from the merchants, many wounded and sick soldiers who should not have sacrificed died, and those who should not have been disabled were crippled. He hoped that all Shanghai shop assistants would bravely wage struggle and use the victory of the struggle to coordinate with the military victory on the front lines.

    After Li Ronggen, a representative of the Korean People's Visiting Delegation to China, and Huang Xianming, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, reported on the heroic battles of the Chinese and Korean soldiers, amidst thunderous applause and cheers, representatives from various districts presented 132,374 letters of denunciation from shop assistants collected from February 8th to 15th to the presidium of the conference, together with those received previously and those received on the spot, a total of 204,344, as a gift to the conference.

    The conference unanimously adopted a resolution to accept the challenge from Tianjin shop assistants and issue a challenge to shop assistants nationwide. The challenge conditions are as follows: First, guarantee that every shop assistant in Shanghai will resolutely and consciously devote themselves to the great struggle against bribery, against tax evasion, against theft and embezzlement of state property, against shoddy workmanship and reduced materials, and against theft of state economic intelligence with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm; second, give full play to the strength of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft and embezzlement of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship and reduced materials, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement branches and inspection groups, use our brains, create methods, and guarantee to expose every illegal act of every shop; third, further organize tiger-hunting forces according to industry and trade, encircle and suppress big tigers at every level, and never let go of a single tiger; fourth, strengthen learning, improve class consciousness, further expose the ugly nature of the bourgeoisie, draw a clear line of demarcation between classes, do not be arrogant, do not be complacent, and completely smash the bourgeoisie's attack.

    [This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Shop assistants in Chongqing and Jinan are determined to accept the challenge from Tianjin shop assistants and launch a competition to capture big profiteers. Nearly 10,000 shop assistants in private shops in Chongqing held a mobilization meeting on the fifteenth to capture big profiteers. Chongqing shop assistants have already exposed more than 16,000 pieces of evidence of illegal activities by profiteers. According to preliminary calculations, the total value of state losses caused by these cases amounts to more than 100 billion yuan. Forty-eight big profiteers who stole and embezzled state property worth more than 100 million yuan to less than 4 billion yuan have been arrested. At the meeting, Shi Jisheng and 25 other shop assistants who were not threatened or lured, were not afraid of hardship, carefully studied, actively worked, and strived to fight against big profiteers and made contributions to the people of the motherland were publicly commended; Xu Dumin and eight other senior staff members who had changed their thinking, put down their burdens, boldly reported, and bravely captured big profiteers were publicly encouraged; Zhang Xinxian and Long Yuanxiong, who willingly acted as running dogs of profiteers, lost the standpoint of the working class, and failed to change after repeated education, were expelled from the trade union membership.

    The conference finally adopted a letter of challenge to Tianjin shop assistants: Guarantee to eliminate all thieves; strengthen class education, eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie, eliminate concerns, tear down face-saving pretenses, and boldly expose the crimes of illegal merchants; raise vigilance and strictly prevent various conspiracies and sabotage activities by profiteers. A demonstration parade was held after the meeting.

    The 121 "Tiger Hunting Combat Assault Groups" formed by Jinan shop assistants immediately held discussions and resolved to accept the challenge after seeing the letter of challenge written by Tianjin shop assistants to shop assistants nationwide. In their letter of challenge to Tianjin shop assistants, they guaranteed to launch a comprehensive encirclement and suppression campaign against profiteers, not to let a single "tiger" slip through the net, and to guarantee that each group would catch at least one "tiger"; break down concerns, bravely and boldly wage a face-to-face ruthless struggle against big profiteers, and expose all the evil deeds of profiteers; trade union cadres at all levels take the lead, lead the masses, concentrate their firepower, and launch a fierce attack on big profiteers; raise vigilance and be ready to smash the conspiracies and sabotage of profiteers at any time.

    会上，中国店员工会上海市委员会副主席韩西雅致词说：正当全国人民热烈展开抗美援朝运动的时候，那些利欲薰心的奸商们却以臭牛肉、臭鱼肉来装供给志愿军的罐头，在许多援朝物资的加工定货中偷工减料，甚至无耻地吞没志愿军的购药巨款。对于这些丧心病狂的资本家，上海店员正在学习中朝英雄战士的战斗精神，向他们展开愈来愈猛烈的斗争。韩西雅代表全市店员向代表团保证：决以反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争的彻底胜利来支援前线。

    朝鲜人民访华代表团代表李荣根、中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表黄先明先后报告了朝、中战士英勇作战的事迹后，在雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声中，各区代表将自二月八日至十五日所收到的店员检举信十三万二千三百七十四件送上大会主席台，连以前收到的和会上当场收到的共二十万零四千三百四十四件，作为对大会的献礼。
    大会最后一致通过向天津店员应战并向全国店员挑战。挑战条件如下：一、保证上海每一个店员都以高度的爱国热情，坚决地、自觉地投入伟大的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争；二、发挥反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动支会和检查组的力量，开动脑筋，创造办法，保证检举出每一爿商店的每一件不法行为；三、进一步根据一行一业，组织捉虎力量，对大老虎进行层层围剿，决不放过一只老虎；四、加强学习，提高阶级觉悟，进一步揭露资产阶级的丑恶本质，划清阶级界限，不骄傲，不自满，彻底粉碎资产阶级的进攻。
