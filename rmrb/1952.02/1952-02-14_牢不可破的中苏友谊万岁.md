    Long Live the Unbreakable Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Cai Chang
    On the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, I extend warm congratulations to the sisters of the Soviet Union!
    The facts of the past two years have proven that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a powerful guarantee for defending peace in the East and the world, and also a powerful guarantee for the smooth construction of our new China. In the past two years, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, our national economy has rapidly recovered and developed.
    We Chinese women, together with the entire Chinese people, sincerely thank Marshal Stalin and the entire Soviet people for this great friendship.
    The broad masses of women in our country increasingly recognize that the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is in the greatest interest of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and thus strive for the development of this friendly cooperation. Among female workers, peasant women, and even ordinary housewives, one can see members wearing badges of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association everywhere. A worker's mother, when asked why she joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, replied: "For world peace, for the construction of the motherland, and for the children to have a future like the Soviet Union today." Chinese women, especially the broad masses of working women, regard the creative labor of Soviet women as a shining example, and see our own bright future in the happy life of the Soviet people today. Therefore, we are filled with enthusiasm and confidence to participate in the construction of the motherland and, following the Soviet women, strive to defend world peace. We firmly believe that the friendly unity between the Chinese and Soviet people will develop more extensively and deeply. This friendly unity is indestructible! No one can separate it! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live Marshal Stalin! Long live the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship!

    牢不可破的中苏友谊万岁
    蔡畅
    在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的两周年纪念日，我向苏联的姊妹们致热烈的祝贺！
    两年来的事实证明，中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订是保卫东方和世界和平的有力保证，也是我们新中国顺利进行建设的有力保证。两年中间，在苏联的援助之下，我们的国民经济迅速地恢复和发展了。
    我们中国妇女，与全中国人民一起，衷心地感谢斯大林大元帅和全苏联人民的这种伟大友谊。
    我国广大的妇女群众日益认识了中苏两国人民的友好合作是中国人民和世界人民的最大利益，从而为这一友好合作关系的发展而努力。在女工、农妇、乃至普通的家庭妇女中，都随处可以看见挂着中苏友好协会证章的会员，有一个工人的母亲，当别人问她为什么加入中苏友好协会时，她回答说：“为了世界和平，为了建设祖国，为了孩子们有像苏联今天一样的将来。”中国妇女，特别是广大的劳动妇女，把苏联妇女的创造性劳动当作光辉的榜样，并且，从苏联人民今天幸福的生活中看到了我们自己灿烂的明天。因此，我们充满着热情和信心，参加祖国的建设，并紧随着苏联妇女，为保卫世界和平而努力。我们坚信，中苏两国人民的友好团结还要更广泛地更深入地发展起来。这种友好团结是不可破坏的！是没有人能够分离的！毛泽东主席万岁！斯大林大元帅万岁！牢不可破的中苏友谊万岁！
