Refuting the Bourgeoisie's Fallacies
	Has the Bourgeoisie Not Frenziedly Attacked the Working Class?
	Yang Er
    The bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks have met with strong counterattacks, and many of them are unwilling to accept defeat and repent sincerely, still wanting to continue their attacks. Therefore, the capitalists themselves, as well as their spokespersons or apologists, have issued fallacies as shields to deal with the working class's counterattacks and as smokescreens for continued attacks. These people want to use this to trick many honest people who know nothing or very little about class struggle, to sympathize with the bourgeoisie, and to remain neutral in the struggle.
    There are various kinds of "theoretical" shields or "theoretical" smokescreens, which can be roughly divided into three categories, but they all focus on one point: resolutely opposing the so-called "bourgeoisie's frenzied attack."
    Is it the bourgeoisie attacking, or are it "individual unscrupulous merchants" attacking?
    The first category says, "There are indeed a few unprincipled and illegal capitalists, but we cannot say that the entire bourgeoisie is attacking; we cannot say that the entire group is bad just because there are black sheep." "If it is said to be an attack, where is the organized army? Where is the commander? Where are the guns and weapons?" In short, it is said that the so-called "bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the working class" is nothing but a lie, and there is no such thing at all.
    The nature of the bourgeoisie is to get rich by exploiting workers, and to get rich endlessly, which requires the unlimited development of private capitalism. Historical facts have proven that the Chinese national bourgeoisie cannot lead the Chinese revolution to victory; the Chinese revolution was successful under the leadership of the working class, and the leadership of the working class has been undoubtedly and completely established. Although many capitalists have expressed their acceptance of the leadership of the working class, they still want to lead themselves in reality; although they have also expressed that private capital should accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, they still want private capitalism to lead in reality. For the past three years, China has had an unprecedentedly broad road that allows private capital to develop legally and properly under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy. In this way, the bourgeoisie should seem to "obtain legitimate profits" and "give full play to their initiative under the leadership of the state-owned economy," as many honest people think and as the capitalists themselves express verbally. But no, they insist on pursuing illegal and shocking exorbitant profits, secretly undermining the state-owned economy, and giving full play to the backward and reactionary side of their class's "two-sidedness," that is, the "initiative" to destroy the Common Program and the state's policies and laws. They have adopted various illegal, criminal, and insane methods to massively seize and steal the state's wealth; they have also adopted various vile and shameless methods to implement "pulling over and sending in," installing their own spies in state organs, especially state-owned economic organs, and turning wavering elements in the revolutionary ranks into their own lackeys, vainly attempting to secretly transform the leadership of the working class into the leadership of the bourgeoisie in many departments, enterprises, and regions. "Stealing the sky and changing the sun" is a play that the bourgeoisie dreams of realizing and strives to direct. We say that this is called the bourgeoisie's "attack" on the Chinese working class and its political party—the Communist Party of China—and its "attack" on our revolutionary ranks.
    It is not only an "attack," but also a "frenzied attack." This means that this attack is not sporadic, accidental, or insignificant, but systematic, large-scale, and high-spirited, and therefore truly frenzied. From an economic point of view, the unscrupulous capitalists' unbridled plunder of the wealth of the state and the people is the "battle result" they have gained in the frenzied attack on the economy. Based on preliminary revelations alone, it is already shocking enough. More than 190 unscrupulous industrial and commercial households in Beijing illegally embezzled 200 billion yuan of the people's wealth. Tax evasion in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles reached 800 billion yuan. Shanghai, the national industrial and commercial center, has the most common tax evasion in industrial and commercial circles. In the case of the unscrupulous merchant Zhu Peinong alone, more than 11.8 billion yuan was evaded. From this local perspective, to imagine the entire country, how much wealth has the bourgeoisie illegally sucked up? The illegal bourgeoisie has become an extremely vicious and greedy tapeworm drilling into the stomach of the state and the people. It not only wants to make us weak and exhausted, but simply vainly attempts to kill us. Secondly, from a political point of view, many capitalists' opposition to the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy is no longer limited to "secret criticism," "whispering," or "private discussions," and is no longer limited to absurdly distorting the policy of "both public and private interests and labor-capital mutual benefit," and is no longer limited to attacking the state's restrictive policies as "short-sighted." They have openly demanded that the government accept their absurd proposal to revise and destroy the Common Program as a legitimate proposal. Last autumn, Xu Dixing, director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, criticized the idea of ​​profiteering to representatives of the industrial and commercial circles, emphasizing the leadership of the working class. Representatives of the industrial and commercial circles murmured, openly expressing dissatisfaction. When Chen Yi, the mayor of Shanghai, said in his opening speech at the third session of the second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress that the leadership of the proletariat should be established and the erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie should be criticized, representatives of the industrial and commercial circles openly proposed to revise it, and even presumptuously drafted the revised text. In the early days of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, representatives of industrial and commercial circles in some places agreed to collectively arrive late at the People's Congresses, and did not clap for the leadership's reports to show "protest." In some places, capitalists quarreled and clamored in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, or even refused to allow leading organs to send people to attend. As for many manufacturers who were rescued from danger by government processing orders, they ungratefully openly refused to continue processing orders or openly refused government cadres to go to the factory to understand the processing situation. This kind of thing has happened more than three or five times. In short, some bourgeoisie have openly expressed that they want to become wild horses out of rein, and their arrogance is very high. Third, in terms of labor-capital relations, many capitalists' hostility towards the working class is very significant. They constantly make trouble, distort policies, and inch forward; they use all kinds of illegal actions against the working class and trade union organizations, such as dispatching controls, luring and threatening, anesthetizing and dividing, and attacking and framing. As for the conscious ideological erosion of the bourgeoisie, it is even more pervasive. The Xinhua News Agency forwarded a large amount of data published by the Worker's Daily on February 7, which is only a small part of various frenzied actions. The data on the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack revealed in the newspaper recently is still just a drop in the bucket compared to the facts that exist in reality. The number of attacking facts is so large that it is truly "difficult to count even with more servants, and difficult to write even with all the bamboo." Although unscrupulous capitalists are good at making false accounts, sometimes from two sets to four sets, in the face of these attacking facts, it is impossible to compile false accounts or simply deny them.
    In addition, what is especially intolerable to anyone with a patriotic heart is that unscrupulous capitalists not only dig out life-saving rations from the mouths of fellow countrymen who are on the verge of death, and not only illegally steal huge sums of money from national defense projects and Huai River control projects, but they also dare to launch a dehumanizing underground attack on the Chinese People's Volunteers. It is not enough to say that they are "blinded by profit." Gold has corrupted them to be more poisonous than snakes and scorpions and more ruthless than tigers and wolves. They used rotten wires to impersonate good wires, used inferior rubber shoes to impersonate good rubber shoes, used soft iron shovels to impersonate good iron shovels, used liquids that would rust after wiping to impersonate gun cleaning oil, used broken car parts to impersonate good car parts... secretly sabotage the combat operations of the volunteers; they used fake medicines, first aid kits with unsterilized rotten cotton, moldy rice flour and stinky egg flour, canned stinky meat, soda biscuits, and pickles mixed with horse manure and sand to mutilate and murder the volunteers. They colluded with American imperialism from within and without, and completed the tasks that the American bandits could not complete. Is there any room for not giving the most severe sanctions to this kind of crime of betraying the motherland and committing unforgivable sins?
    Can all this not be called an "attack" or a "frenzied attack"?
    Indeed, not every member of the bourgeoisie participated in the attacking action without exception. Unfortunately, the number of bourgeois elements who clearly understood this goal and who did not clearly or not very clearly understand this goal, but who actually participated in or partially participated in these attacking actions, is not a "small number"; on the contrary, it is precisely the majority of capitalists who participated in this "flood of private capitalism." If the number of industrial and commercial households with illegal activities in Beijing and Shenyang is used as a "reference number," then the number in Beijing is more than 40,000, accounting for 80% of the total number of households, and in Shenyang it is more than 21,000 households, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total number of households. These numbers silenced the spokespersons or apologists of the bourgeoisie. It is really unfortunate that the "unprincipled" and "illegal" capitalists and the so-called "black sheep" are not only individual and few, but so many that they are "in groups" and reached the "majority" of the whole. Then what can be done?
    The bourgeoisie did not form an army-like team. Unfortunately, no one can find a precedent in the history of class struggle for organizing every member of the entire class into a team like an army and then conducting the struggle, not to mention today when the leadership of the working class has been completely established, and not to mention in China, where capitalism was originally underdeveloped.
    There is indeed no commander or commander-in-chief to give orders, but unfortunately, many leading figures in the industrial and commercial circles, some of whom are still leading figures in the vast majority of industrial and commercial circles in a region, and most or all of the leading figures in certain industries, have done bad things to varying degrees that harm the country's economic interests, some evading taxes, some using their powers to steal state economic intelligence, creating price increases, making huge profits, and some privately establishing foreign accounts to obtain foreign exchange. In short, among them, there are quite a few who have committed serious illegal acts, and there are very few who have no illegal acts at all. The trend of any class must be reflected in its certain representatives to a greater or lesser extent. Although the above-mentioned many leading figures or representatives of industrial and commercial circles are not necessarily commanders or commanders-in-chief, how can people believe that they must be separated from and opposed to the class they represent, saying that "the pure are pure and the muddy are muddy," and that they have no representativeness at all? Moreover, why is the number of illegal industrial and commercial households in various regions so large? Not only that, but illegal capitalists secretly set up a spy network in state economic organs, sometimes reaching as many as one or two hundred people. Twelve large industrial and commercial households in Chongqing also privately organized "Star Four Dinner Parties," and the bourgeoisie in Anshan secretly colluded to form the so-called "Eight Great Families." This is already in essence setting up small staff departments or command posts. There are no guns and weapons, but how can it be said that only military attacks can be considered class attacks?
    From a large number of phenomena, it is indeed the "class" that is attacking, not "individual elements" that are attacking; it is indeed the "group" that is attacking, not the "black sheep" of the "horse" that is attacking. This is the conclusion made by the objective facts themselves.
    "Things must rot before worms grow," who should be responsible?
    The second category says: "Even if it is an attack, things must rot before worms grow, and the responsibility lies with the thing that rots first." "Your bureaucracy is too serious, your education of cadres is too poor, your systems are too incomplete, your experience is too lacking, your vigilance is not enough... Why don't you reflect on yourselves when you are corrupted, and only blame the bourgeoisie?" "The bourgeoisie should be responsible for unscrupulous merchants, and the Communist Party should be responsible for cadres." In short, the working class and the revolutionary ranks should be responsible for being corrupted and eroded. Some seem to admit that there is such a thing as an "attack," but in essence or at least objectively, they still say that the so-called "bourgeoisie's frenzied attack" is nothing more than an excuse for "transferring anger to others" and "shifting blame to others."
    This kind of argument also has another form of expression, that is, "Corruption is not exclusive to the bourgeoisie, and workers and farmers also have corruption. Human desires are insatiable, and greed is the nature of human beings. As long as human beings need consumer goods such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, there will be corrupt ideas. Everyone has corrupt ideas, but it is only a matter of degree." Such an argument is more "thorough" than the "things must rot" theory. The world is full of large and small corrupt animals, or at least "ideological corrupt elements" with corrupt ideas in their heads, who have simply not had the opportunity to carry out corruption. Then, the so-called "bourgeoisie's frenzied attack" is not only for "transferring anger" and "shifting blame," but is simply a "trumped-up" ghost story.
    This kind of argument starts from exploring the root of corruption, and finally proves that corruption is a universal human nature, thereby overturning the argument of "attack." It is naturally necessary to explore the roots, but Marxism-Leninism has irrefutably proved that it is the existence of society and the conditions of society's material life that determine the appearance of social thought, theory, political views, and political systems; it is people's social existence that determines people's consciousness, that is, what class has what class's views and consciousness. This is a truth, and anyone who does not believe in this truth will be bruised and battered in the face of reality.
    Can corruption, harming others to benefit oneself, harming the public to benefit oneself, and stealing state wealth—in short, the objects that the anti-corruption campaign or the anti-bribery campaign wants to oppose—be produced from the proletariat? The proletariat does not occupy the means of production, engages in collective labor, enjoys the fruits of its labor, and fundamentally does not exploit others. The class ideology, or the foundation of the outlook on life, of the proletariat is absolutely incompatible with harming others to benefit oneself. On the contrary, the bourgeoisie occupies the means of production, does not work but eats, enjoys the fruits of the labor of the masses, and lives by exploiting others. The class ideology, or the foundation of the outlook on life, of the bourgeoisie is to harm others to benefit oneself. The feudal landlord class is the same in this respect. The old world ruled by the exploiting classes is like a big dye vat, and this dye vat is full of the poison of selfishness, and the exploiting classes are the total source of all poisons in this dye vat and the darkest core in this dye vat. People born in the old society ruled by the exploiting classes fall into the dye vat as soon as they leave the womb. Although the working people are exploited, they have a certain degree of immunity and a certain amount of antidote to the contamination of poison, but they inevitably get dirty to a greater or lesser extent. However, the exploiting classes grow in this most poisonous and darkest core, and not only do they not dislike dirt, but they are also using this dirty thing as an indispensable nutrient and a very beneficial tonic for their development, growth, and strengthening. Their consciousness is exploitation and annexation, eating, drinking, and having fun, and "Heaven and earth will punish those who are not for themselves."
    Corruption, harming others to benefit oneself, and harming the public to benefit oneself all stem from the ideological source of exploiting others and not working but gaining, and are completely opposed to and incompatible with the ideology of the working class. There are indeed people in the working class who commit corruption crimes, and there are also people in the peasantry who commit corruption crimes, but that is not spontaneously growing out of the essence of the working people, and even more completely not growing out of the essence of the working class. That is because they also fell into the dye vat of the society ruled by the exploiting classes as soon as they were born, that is, the dye vat full of the poison of selfishness, and they got dirty, and then they did not do the work of cleaning and washing, and when they encountered an opportunity, they broke out. Some people, after being infected with this poison of the exploiting classes, and after the education of the revolutionary organization and self-examination and self-cultivation, washed away the poison and strengthened their ideological stand, are able to resist the erosion of the exploiting classes; some people have not completely washed away the poison, or even completely cleaned it, although they are members of the revolutionary ranks, their bodies have weaknesses, or serious weaknesses, and therefore, they have the possibility of being used and attacked by the exploiting classes and enemies; some people are fundamentally landlords and bourgeois elements, with a head full of exploitation ideas, they have sneaked into the revolutionary ranks, and not only do they want to be corrupt themselves, but they also want to spread the influence of the exploiting classes within the revolutionary ranks, corrupting the surrounding cadres and organizations. The revolutionary ranks cannot only absorb people who have not been contaminated with the poison of the old society, but for those who have been contaminated with some poison of the old society but are willing to make progress, they must still be allowed to make revolution and given the opportunity to work and exercise. Under the constant education and help of these people in the revolutionary organization, through their own constant efforts, they can slowly progress until they completely get rid of the poison imposed on them by the old society. But since they have weaknesses in their bodies, and flies are sensitive to the smell of decay, the bourgeoisie are drilling into the cracks of the weaknesses of the attacking object and never letting go. The bourgeoisie use all kinds of shameless methods, giving gifts and bribes, complimenting and flattering, building relationships, using the honey trap... with traps everywhere and a net spread over the sky, surrounding them, expanding the defects in their bodies, and even causing them to burst into incurable rotten sores, making them disgraced and falling into becoming enemies of the people. Of course, the attack of the bourgeoisie is ineffective in front of revolutionaries with strong will. These corrupted and corrupt elements themselves had loopholes to exploit, but can the bourgeoisie who launched sugar-coated bullets not be held responsible for this frenzied attack? Can they instead push this responsibility onto the Communist Party's bureaucracy, insufficient education, imperfect systems, and insufficient vigilance? Saying that "things must rot before worms grow," not to mention its reversal of facts in natural science and the ridiculous ignorance of those who hold this argument, even if it can explain that the object being corrupted has its own subjective weaknesses, without the frenzied attack of the bourgeoisie, weaknesses can be overcome. It is precisely because of this frenzied attack that many cadres who have weaknesses but may be able to train and make progress, and therefore are also useful, have fallen in large numbers in the face of the bourgeoisie's vicious attack. In this case, instead of being indignant at and hating the bourgeoisie, they coldly ridicule the revolutionary ranks and point fingers at them, and accuse them of being responsible for "the things have already rotted." This fully proves that those who hold this fallacy have no revolutionary enthusiasm at all, and perhaps even have other suspicious purposes. If he is not an unscrupulous merchant himself, he is at least a prisoner of bourgeois ideology, or a spokesperson or apologist raised by unscrupulous merchants and illegal bourgeoisie.
    The bourgeoisie even dares to teach people with a straight face, "Your bureaucracy is too serious, your education of cadres is too poor, your systems are too incomplete, your experience is too lacking, your vigilance is not enough..." If these words are all said correctly, we will strengthen our defense against your attacks entirely according to your words. However, these criticisms and self-criticisms should still be carried out within our revolutionary ranks. We are opposing and will continue to oppose bureaucracy in our own ranks, and we are educating and will continue to educate cadres, strengthen systems, and oppose and will continue to oppose right-leaning ideas and strengthen vigilance against the attacks of the bourgeoisie. We will do all these things, and we also welcome the people's supervision and suggestions. If the above criticisms come from the mouth of a kind-hearted gentleman, we are sincerely grateful and hope that they will continue to criticize us. However, if the people who say these words are the illegal bourgeoisie themselves or their spokespersons and apologists, then please put them away quickly. If you had said those words earlier, and we had really guarded against them in time, how could you have gained such great "battle results"? Wouldn't that be too disadvantageous to the gentlemen? Now, we are indeed following your "advice" and have indeed raised our vigilance, and we want to seriously and solemnly suppress your frenzied attack. You are anxious, so you shout and scream. These fallacies that seem to criticize us but are actually attacking us have been launched. But we want to point out bluntly: You use the method of pointing out the non-essential shortcomings on our bodies, attempting to prove to the people that you have not attacked, or attempting to prove that we have been eroded, corrupted, and attacked by you, and that it is all "our own fault." Then, we must ask you in return: Do robbers and thieves have the right to criticize your insecure doors and prove that their robbery and theft are "reasonable"?
    This is the essence of the so-called "things must rot before worms grow" or the so-called "both sides are responsible" theory. Although we also agree with "not discarding words because of the person," we must expose the ulterior motives of the "words" of illegal capitalists and their spokespersons or apologists.
    In addition, it should be pointed out here that the fallacy of "everyone has the idea of ​​corruption" proves that the person who says such things has a mind permeated with the poison of the exploiting classes. He is used to "deceiving each other." He believes that if he does not harm others, he will be harmed by others. He has been "living in a shop selling dried fish" for a long time and even believes that this stench is inherent in the air itself. He fundamentally does not understand or believe that there are people in the world who can treat others equally, be selfless and impartial, and forget themselves for the public. He fundamentally does not understand or believe that all human beings in the future communist society will be human beings who treat others equally, be selfless and impartial, and forget themselves for the public. This decadent thought is not worth paying attention to, but it insists on emitting a foul smell and deduces a more absurd "theory" saying: "Everyone has the heart of corruption, and corrupt elements are unlucky because they unfortunately encountered the opportunity for corruption; therefore, corrupt elements are pitiful but not hateful." This kind of argument is to speak up for the corrupt elements who are the moths of the country, and to relax and disintegrate our front against the anti-corruption struggle and against the attack of the bourgeoisie. It is completely necessary for all loyal and active patriots to rise up and refute it resolutely.
    In addition, there are things like "the national bourgeoisie is not the bourgeoisie," "the bourgeoisie's hedonistic ideology can stimulate the enthusiasm for production" (actually, it stimulates the "madness of exploitation"), and "opposing waste will make life lose its fun"... All of these are various manifestations of bourgeois ideology, and there is no need to refute them in detail. A discerning person can easily understand them.
    Who is self-contradictory? Who hinders unity?
    The third and final category is different from the previous two categories. It does not start from the issue of whether there is a "bourgeoisie frenzied attack" itself, but launches a counterattack from the side. This argument says: "Putting forward the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack will hinder the united front and is not conducive to the unity of the four friends." "Saying that the bourgeoisie is attacking is disrespecting the bourgeoisie and violates the spirit of the Common Program." "You say they are friends, and you say they are attacking, which is self-contradictory." In short, whoever says to oppose the bourgeoisie's attack must bear the responsibility for undermining unity and destroying the united front.
    Although this kind of argument raises serious issues such as the Common Program, the united front, the unity of the four friends, and mutual respect, those who hold this ostensibly compassionate but essentially threatening and provocative argument, except for some who are indeed naive gentlemen, if they are not pretending to be stupid and deliberately slandering, are at least extremely lacking in the spirit of "self-reflection." Because it is precisely many illegal bourgeoisie themselves who have adopted extremely bad and harmful attitudes towards these many serious issues and have played extremely bad and harmful roles. Does bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence comply with the Common Program and benefit the united front? Would it be more conducive to unity if only the bourgeoisie is allowed to attack and the state is not allowed to carry out political transformation and legal sanctions on them? In fact, not only the working class, the peasant class, and the petty bourgeoisie cannot tolerate the bourgeoisie's attack, but even a large number of legitimate industrialists and businessmen, especially small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, have also stood on the front of supporting the anti-corruption campaign and the anti-bribery campaign. They have recognized or are beginning to recognize that the transformation and sanctions against those illegal merchants are not only beneficial to the entire country and the people, but also beneficial to their own legitimate operations. It is easier to do business, and there is no need to fear the monopoly and manipulation of illegal merchants. There is no longer any need to use despicable means such as rebates and gifts to compete with illegal merchants for business opportunities. The people who support the working class to suppress the bourgeoisie's attack are the vast majority and are increasing. The united front has become more developed and consolidated because it has squeezed out, transformed, and sanctioned the harmful elements mixed in it. It is also necessary to talk about morality when making friends. If only attacks are allowed but unreasonable attacks are not allowed to be suppressed, friends cannot be made well. Mutual respect is indeed very important, but unfortunately, many illegal bourgeoisie are completely unworthy of the people's respect for them. A number of illegal bourgeoisie hold important and responsible positions in the People's Government or the People's Democratic United Front working bodies, and many unscrupulous merchants serve as representatives of the People's Congress or hold the main responsible positions in people's organizations, especially the Federation of Industry and Commerce or various industry associations. It cannot be said that the people's respect and trust in them is not deep and thick. However, it is a pity that this respect and trust has become a weapon to facilitate their illegal activities and to carry out various despicable and dirty activities of attacking the state-owned economy and attacking the working class. Those who have insulted and failed the people's trust and respect, shamelessly want people to maintain "respect" for them, which is really chilling.
    Beside this kind of argument issued in the posture of a "political commentator" and defending the bourgeoisie, there is another trick of slandering and beating someone with his own stick. This time, he appears in the posture of a rumor-monger. They said: "Land reform was implemented last year, and commercial reform will be implemented this year." "Socialism is to be implemented and capitalists will be abolished." "Public and private are not allowed to have close relations (that is, the state-owned economy and the private economy are cut off from contact)." "The next step is to deal with the petty bourgeoisie." There are even more rogue ones who say, "It is not allowed to eat well, and it is not allowed to spend money if you have money." However, since it is a rumor, the market and life are limited. If people degenerate to the point of relying on rumors to eat, it proves that they have declined to a pitiful degree.
    Various defenses are invalid, and the final line of defense is prepared. This is to transform into a "victim" who is wrongly accused and has nowhere to appeal; they say, "The bourgeoisie must have the mind to be slandered by others today, and we can always use facts to prove our innocence tomorrow." Here, tears seem to be "filling the eyes," but even honest people can see that they are squeezed out. It is naturally very good to change tomorrow; the deeds of the frenzied attack in the past are ironclad evidence and can be examined in detail, and they cannot be washed away by squeezing out a little tear.
    Putting away all fallacies, sincerely repenting and admitting guilt is one way; spreading various slanders and resolutely attacking to the end is another way. The former is the broad road for the bourgeoisie, and the latter has already "this road is blocked." The bourgeoisie and its spokespersons or apologists should be aware that it is better to put down these weapons of continued attack.

　　驳斥资产阶级的谬论
    资产阶级没有向工人阶级猖狂进攻吗？
    杨耳
    资产阶级的猖狂进攻遇到了坚强的反攻，他们当中的许多人很不甘心，不肯老老实实地悔过认罪，还想继续进攻下去。于是，资本家自己，还有他们的代言人或辩护士，就大发谬论，当做对付工人阶级反攻的挡箭牌，继续进攻的烟幕弹。这些人想借此使得许多对阶级斗争完全不懂、或懂得甚少的老实人上当，对资产阶级表同情，对斗争守中立。
    有各种各样挡箭牌的“理论”或烟幕弹的“理论”，大致可以分为三类，但又都集中在一点上，就是坚决反对有所谓“资产阶级的猖狂进攻”。
    是资产阶级进攻呢，还是“个别奸商”进攻呢？
    第一类说，“少数不肖不法的资本家是有的，但不能说整个资产阶级在进攻；不能因为有了害群之马，就说整个群也不好。”“说是进攻，有组织的队伍在那里？司令员在那里？枪炮武器在那里？”总之是说，所谓“资产阶级向工人阶级的猖狂进攻”，不过是一句谎话，根本没有这样一回事。
    资产阶级的本性就是靠剥削工人发财，而且要无止境地发财，这就要求无限制地发展私人资本主义。历史事实证明，中国民族资产阶级不能领导中国的革命走向胜利；中国的革命是在工人阶级领导之下获得成功的，工人阶级的领导权已经无疑地完全确立了。有许多资本家虽然表示接受工人阶级的领导，其实还是想让自己来领导；虽也表示私人资本要接受国营经济的领导，其实还是想让私人资本主义来领导。三年来，中国有着空前宽广的大路，可以让私人资本在工人阶级和国营经济领导之下，合法地正当地来发展。这样说来，资产阶级似乎应该依照许多老实人所想的和资本家自己口头上所表示的那样，“取得合法的利润”，“在国营经济领导下发挥自己的积极性”了。可是不，偏要追求非法的惊人的暴利，偏要暗中挖国营经济的墙脚，偏要发挥自己阶级的“两面性”里落后的和反动的一面，也就是破坏共同纲领、破坏国家政策法令的“积极性”。他们采用了各种各样违法犯罪、丧心病狂的方法，大量侵吞盗窃国家的财富；他们还采用了各种各样卑鄙无耻的方法，实行“拉过来，派进去”，在国家机关里特别是国营经济机关里按上自己的侦探，变革命队伍里意志不坚定的分子成为自己的走狗，妄想在许多部门、企业、地区里，暗暗地就把工人阶级的领导权变成资产阶级的领导权。实行“偷天换日”，就是资产阶级所梦想实现的、所竭力导演的一出戏。我们说，这就叫做资产阶级向中国工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党的“进攻”，向我们革命队伍的“进攻”。
    不仅是“进攻”，而且还是“猖狂的进攻”。这就是说，这个进攻不是零星的、偶然的、微不足道的，而是有系统的、大规模的、气焰高涨的，因而实实在在是猖狂的。从经济方面看，不法资本家肆无忌惮地掠夺国家和人民的财富，也就是他们猖狂进攻在经济上获得的“战果”，仅根据初步的揭发，就已经是足够使人惊心动魄了。北京不法工商界一百九十多家就非法侵吞人民财富二千亿元，天津工商界漏税达到人民币八千亿，全国工商中心的上海，工商界漏税最普遍，单是奸商竺培农一案就偷漏税款一百十八亿以上。由此局部以推想全国，资产阶级非法吮吸的财富又该有多少？不法资产阶级已经成为钻在国家和人民肚里极恶毒贪狠的绦虫，它不仅要使我们衰颓疲敝，简直妄想致我们于死命了。其次，从政治上看，许多资本家反对工人阶级和国营经济的领导，已经不只限于“腹诽”“耳语”或“窃窃私议”了，已经不只限于妄发谬论曲解“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的政策了，已经不只限于攻击国家对他们的限制政策为“眼光短小”了，他们已经公开要政府接受他们修改与破坏共同纲领的荒谬主张作为合法的主张了，去年秋季上海市工商局局长许涤新向工商界代表批评暴利思想，强调工人阶级的领导，工商界代表嘁嘁喳喳，公开表示不满；上海市市长陈毅在上海市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议的开幕词中，说到要确立无产阶级的领导，批判资产阶级的错误思想，工商界代表公然提出要修改，甚至狂妄到代为拟好了修改的文字。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动发动的初期，有的地方工商界代表在各界人民代表会议中相约集体迟到，并对领导上的报告不鼓掌，以示“抗议”，有的地方，资本家在工商联合会中吵嚷叫嚣，或竟拒绝领导机关派人出席。至于许多靠了政府加工定货才转危为安的厂商，忘恩负义地公然拒绝继续加工定货或公然拒绝政府干部到厂了解加工情况，这种事实已经不止发生了三五起。总之，有些资产阶级已经公开表示要变成脱缰野马，气焰十分嚣张。第三，在劳资关系方面，许多资本家对工人阶级的仇视情绪十分显著，他们不断地借端寻事，曲解政策，得寸进尺；他们对工人阶级及工会组织的派遣控制、利诱威胁、麻醉分化、打击陷害……种种不法举动，无所不用其极。至于资产阶级有意识的思想侵蚀，更是无孔不入。二月七日新华社转发了工人日报刊载的大量资料，不过是各种猖狂行动的一小部分，近来每天报纸揭露的资产阶级猖狂进攻的资料，比起现实存在着的事实，也还是沧海一粟。进攻的事实之多，名符其实的是多到“更仆难数，罄竹难书”的程度。不法资产阶级虽然善造假账，有时从两套多到四套，但在这些进攻事实的面前，要想另编假账或干脆翻脸不认账，那是办不到的。
    除此之外，尤其使任何一个稍具爱国心肠的人所绝对不能容忍的，就是不法资本家不仅要在垂危待毙的难民同胞的口中挖出续命的口粮，不仅要在国防工程和治淮工程上非法偷窃巨款，而且胆大妄为，竟然敢于对中国人民志愿军发动灭绝人性的地下的进攻。说他们“利令智昏”是不够了，黄金已经使他们堕落得比蛇蝎更毒、比虎狼更狠了。他们用烂电线冒充好电线、用劣等胶鞋冒充好胶鞋、用软铁铲冒充好铁铲、用擦了便要生锈的液体冒充擦枪油、用坏的汽车零件冒充好的汽车零件……暗中破坏志愿军的作战行动；他们用假药、用不消毒的烂棉花的急救包、用霉米粉和臭蛋粉、用臭肉罐头、用石碱做的饼干、用掺了马粪和砂子的腌菜，残害和谋杀志愿军的勇士。他们和美帝国主义“里应外合”，并完成了美国强盗所不能完成的任务。这种出卖祖国、万恶不赦的罪行，难道还有可以不予以最严厉制裁的余地么？
    所有这些，难道不可以叫做“进攻”或“猖狂的进攻”么？
    确实不是资产阶级每个人都毫无遗漏地参加了进攻的行动，可惜明确这个目的、和不明确或不很明确这个目的、但在实际上参加或部分参加这些进攻行动的资产阶级分子，数目并不是什么“少数”；相反，正是大多数资本家都参加了这一私人资本主义的“洪水泛滥”。如用北京和沈阳有不法行为的工商户的数目当做一个“参考数字”，那么，这个数字在北京是四万多家，即占全体户数的百分之八十，沈阳是二万一千余户，即占全体户数的三分之二以上。这些数目字，把那些资产阶级的代言人或辩护士驳得哑口无言。真不幸，“不肖”“不法”的资本家和所谓“害群之马”，不仅不是个别的，少数的，而是那样多，多到“成群结队”，多到了全体的“大多数”，那还有什么办法呢？
    资产阶级也确实没有组成象军队那样的队伍，可惜谁也不能从阶级斗争的历史上找出把全阶级每个人都象军队一样编成队伍再进行斗争的先例，更不必说是工人阶级领导权已经完全确立的今天，更不必说是在资本主义原来很不发达的中国了。
    确实没有发号施令的司令员或总司令，但可惜许许多多工商界的领导人物，有的还是一个地区绝大多数工商界领导人物，某些行业的大多数甚至全体领导人物，都在不同程度上作了危害国家经济利益的坏事，有的偷税漏税，有的利用职权偷取国家经济情报，制造物价涨风，牟取暴利，有的私立外账，套取外汇，……总之，在他们当中，有着重大违法行为的颇不乏人，完全没有违法行为的，倒是寥寥无几。任何一个阶级的趋向，不能不或多或少在它一定的代表人物身上反映出来。如上的许多工商界的领导人物或代表人物虽不一定是什么司令官或总司令，可是，一定要把他们和他们所代表的阶级分割开来，对立起来，说什么“清者自清，浊者自浊”，说他们丝毫没有代表性，怎能叫人置信呢？而且，为什么各个地区不法工商户的数目又是如此众多呢？不单这样，不法资本家在国家经济机关中暗设坐探网，规模有的竟达一二百人之多，重庆十二个大工商户还私组“星四聚餐会”，鞍山资产阶级暗中勾结成所谓“八大家”，这已经是在实质上设立小参谋部或司令台了。枪炮武器是没有的，但怎能说只有军事进攻才能算做阶级的进攻呢？
    从大量现象看来，确实是“阶级”在进攻，不是什么“个别分子”在进攻；确实是“群”在进攻，不是什么“害群”的“马”在进攻。这就是客观事实本身所做的结论。
    “物必自腐而后虫生”，究竟应该由谁负责呢？
    第二类说：“就算是进攻吧，可是物必自腐而后虫生，责任是物的先腐。”“你们的官僚主义太严重，你们对干部的教育太差，你们的制度太不完备，经验太欠缺，你们的警惕性太不够……你们被腐蚀了为什么不反躬自问，单单责备资产阶级？”“资产阶级应该对奸商负责任，共产党应该对干部负责任。”总之是说，工人阶级和革命队伍要负被腐化侵蚀之责。有的口里虽说“双方负责”，实质上或至少在客观上还是说工人阶级和革命队伍要负责。这类论调有的好象也承认有“进攻”这回事，骨子里是说：所谓“资产阶级的猖狂进攻”不过是“迁怒于人”“诿过于人”的口实。
    这一类论调还有另外一种表现形式，就是说：“贪污并不是资产阶级所专有，工人农民也有贪污的。人欲是无餍的，贪多务得是人类的本性，只要人类需要衣食住行的消费资料，就一定有贪污的思想。贪污思想人皆有之，不过是多寡之分。”这样的论调实在比“物必自腐”论更要“彻底”，天下滔滔，都是些大大小小的贪污动物，或至少也是满脑袋贪污思想、仅仅因为缺少机会而未能实行贪污的“思想贪污分子”，那么，所谓“资产阶级的猖狂进攻”不仅是为了“迁怒”和“诿过”，而且根本是“莫须有”的鬼话。
    这一类论调从探究贪污腐化的根源入手，最后证明了贪污腐化是普遍的人性，从而推倒了“进攻”的论据。寻根究源自然是必要的，但是，马克思列宁主义已经无可辩驳地证明：是社会的存在、社会物质生活的条件，决定社会思想、理论、政治观点和政治制度的面貌，是人们的社会存在决定人们的意识，也就是说：什么阶级就有什么阶级的观点和意识。这是一条真理，不相信这条真理，任何人都要在现实面前碰得头破血流的。
    贪污腐化，损人利己，损公肥私，盗窃国家财富……总之，不论反贪污运动或反行贿运动所要反对的对象，能够从无产阶级里产生出来吗？无产阶级，不占有生产资料，集体劳动，自己享受劳动的成果，根本不剥削别人。无产阶级的阶级思想，或人生观的基础，就和损人利己绝对不相容。相反，资产阶级，占有生产资料，不劳而食，坐享群众劳动的成果，靠剥削别人过活。资产阶级的阶级思想，或人生观的基础，就是要损人利已。在这一点上，封建地主阶级也是一样。剥削阶级统治的旧世界，就象一个大染缸，这个染缸里充满了自私自利的污毒，而剥削阶级正是这个染缸里一切污毒的总根源，也是这个染缸里最黑暗的核心。生在剥削阶级所统治的旧社会里的人，脱离了娘胎，就掉进了染缸。劳动人民虽然被人剥削，对沾染污毒虽有一定程度的免疫性和一定数量的抗毒素，可是也不可避免地要多多少少沾上些肮脏东西。而剥削阶级，却生长在这个最污毒最黑暗的核心里面，不但不嫌脏，而且正把这种肮脏的东西当作自己发育、生长、壮大的必不可少的营养料和十分有益的滋补剂。他们的意识就是剥削和兼并，就是吃喝玩乐，就是“人不为己，天诛地灭”。
    贪污腐化、损人利己、损公肥私，都是从剥削别人，不劳而获的思想根源上出发的，和工人阶级思想是完全对立的，互不相容的。工人阶级里确实也有犯贪污罪的，农民里也有犯贪污罪的，但那并不是从劳动人民本质上自发生长出来的，更完全不是工人阶级本质上自发生长出来的。那是因为他们也是生下地就掉在剥削阶级统治的社会，也即充满自私自利的污毒的染缸里，沾上了污秽，后来又未做清除洗涤的功夫，遇到机会就发作起来了。有的人，沾了这种剥削阶级的污毒，经过革命组织的教育和自我检讨、自我修养，把污毒洗净了，思想立场锻炼得坚定了，就能够抵抗剥削阶级的侵蚀了；有的人污毒没有完全洗净，甚至完全没有清洗，他们虽然是革命队伍中的一员，然而他们的身上有弱点，或有严重的弱点，因而也就有被剥削阶级、敌人利用与进攻的可能性；有的人根本就是地主资产阶级分子，一脑袋剥削思想，他们钻进了革命队伍，不仅自己要贪污腐化，还要在革命队伍的内部散布剥削阶级的影响，腐蚀周围的干部和组织。革命的队伍不能只吸收丝毫没有沾染旧社会污毒的人加入自己的行列，对于那些虽然沾染了若干旧社会污毒但愿意进步的人，还是要让他们来革命，并给以工作和锻炼的机会，而这些人在革命组织的不断的教育帮助之下，经过自己不断的努力，是能够慢慢进步，直到完全摆脱旧社会加在身上的毒害的。可是他们既然身上有弱点，而苍蝇对臭味是敏感的，资产阶级对于进攻对象的弱点是钻头觅缝、毫不放松的，资产阶级就针对着这些身上有着缺点而且意志不坚定的分子，施展出一切无耻手法，送礼行贿，恭维拍马，拉感情，美人计，……陷阱重重，天罗地网，把他们包围起来，使他们身上的破绽扩大起来，甚至溃决为无可救药的烂疮，使他们身败名裂，堕落为人民的敌人。固然，资产阶级的进攻在意志坚强的革命者面前是无效的，这些堕落了的贪污腐化分子自己身上原有可乘之隙，可是放射糖衣炮弹的资产阶级，难道可以对这种猖狂的进攻不负丝毫责任吗？难道他们反而可以把这种责任推到共产党的官僚主义、教育不够、制度不严、警惕太差上面去吗？说什么“物必自腐而后虫生”，且不说它在自然科学上的颠倒事实和持这种论调者可笑的无知，就算是它可以解释被腐蚀的对象有其主观上的弱点吧，可是没有资产阶级的猖狂进攻，弱点是可以克服的。正是因为有了这种猖狂进攻，才使得许多虽有弱点但可能锻炼进步的、因而也是有用的干部，大批地在资产阶级恶毒的进攻面前倒了下去，在这种情况下，对资产阶级不愤慨，不仇恨，反而冷言冷语，指手划脚，奚落革命队伍应负“物已先腐”之责，这就充分证明持这种谬论的人，没有丝毫革命热情，也许甚至还带有其他可怀疑的目的。如果他本身不就是奸商，至少也是资产阶级思想上的俘虏，或者是奸商和不法资产阶级所豢养的代言人或辩护士。
    资产阶级竟然还要板着面孔教训人哩，“你们的官僚主义太严重，你们对干部教育太差，你们的制度太不完备，经验太欠缺，你们的警惕性太不够，……”这些话全都算说对了，我们正要全部按照你们的话来加强防备你们的进攻。可是，这些批评与自我批评，还是让我们革命队伍的内部来进行吧。我们正在反对并将继续反对自己队伍中的官僚主义，正在并将继续教育干部、加强制度，正在并将继续反对右倾思想，加强对资产阶级进攻的警惕性。这些事我们都要做，我们也欢迎人民的督促和提意见。前面那些批评的话，如果出之于好心肠的先生之口，我们是衷心感谢，并希望他们继续对我们提出批评。可是，如果说这些话的人，就是不法的资产阶级自己或其代言人辩护士，那么，还是快些收起吧。如果你们早些说出那些话，而且我们真的及早提防起来，你们又怎样能获得这么大的“战果”呢？那不是对先生们太不利了吗？我们现在，确实按照你们的“忠告”，确实提高了警惕性，而且我们要认真严肃地压服你们的猖狂进攻了。你们着急了，于是大叫大嚷了。这些对我们貌似批评实为攻击的谬论也就被发射出来了。可是我们要不客气地指出：你们用指出我们身上非本质的缺点的办法，企图在人民面前证明你们没有进攻，或企图证明我们被你们侵蚀、腐化、进攻，都是我们“咎由自取”，那么，我们一定要反问你们一句：难道强盗和小偷有资格批评你们的门户不严，证明他们的抢劫和偷窃是“合理”的吗？
    这就是所谓“物必自腐而后虫生”或所谓“双方负责”论的实质。我们虽也赞成“不以人废言”，但对于不法资本家及其代言人或辩护士的“言”，我们是一定要揭发其不可告人的动机的。
    附在这里还要指出，所谓“贪污思想人皆有之”的谬论，正证明了讲这样话的人，头脑浸透了剥削阶级的污毒，他自己是“尔虞我诈”惯了，他相信他如果不损人就一定会被人损，他对剥削阶级思想已经是“久入鲍鱼之肆”而且甚至相信这种臭气就是空气本身所具有的了。他根本不懂得、也不相信天地间还有能以平等待人、大公无私、公尔忘私的人。他根本不懂得、也不相信将来共产主义社会里的全体人类，都是这种平等待人、大公无私、公尔忘私的人类。这种腐朽思想本来不值得理睬，但是它偏要发散恶臭，并推论出更荒谬的“理论”说：“贪污之心人皆有之，贪污分子是运气不好，因为他不幸遇到了贪污的机会；所以贪污分子可怜不可恨。”这样论调，就是要为国家蛀虫的贪污分子张目，就是要松弛并瓦解我们反对贪污斗争、反对资产阶级进攻的阵线。一切忠诚积极的爱国者起来予以坚决驳斥，是完全必要的。
    此外，还有什么“民族资产阶级不是资产阶级”呀，“资产阶级享乐思想可以刺激生产的积极性”（实际是刺激“剥削的疯狂性”）呀，“反对浪费会使得人生失去了乐趣”呀，……都是资产阶级思想的各种表现形式，不必细驳，明眼人不难一看就明白的。
    谁自相矛盾？谁妨害团结？
    第三类，也即最后一类，和前面两类不同，它不从究竟有无“资产阶级猖狂进攻”问题的本身着手，而是从侧面反戈一击。这种论调说：“提出资产阶级猖狂进攻，要妨害统一战线，对四个朋友的团结不利。”“说资产阶级进攻，是对资产阶级不尊重，违背共同纲领精神。”“又说是朋友，又说是进攻，自相矛盾。”总之是说，谁要说反对资产阶级进攻，谁就要负破坏团结，破坏统一战线的责任。
    这一种论调虽然抬出了共同纲领、统一战线、四个朋友的团结、互相尊重等等严肃的问题，但是，持着这种表面上悲天悯人实质上意含威胁和挑拨论调的人，除了有些确实是幼稚的先生们以外，如果并非装呆卖傻、故意反诬，至少也是极端缺少“反躬自省”的精神。因为正是许多不法的资产阶级自己，对这许多严肃的问题采了极恶劣极有害的态度，并起了极恶劣极有害的作用。难道行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报，会合乎共同纲领，有利于统一战线？难道只许资产阶级进攻、不许国家对它加以政治上的改造和法律上的制裁，会更有利于团结？事实上，不但工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级，对资产阶级的进攻不能容忍，甚至大量的正当工商业者、特别是中小工商业者，也站到拥护反贪污运动、反行贿运动的战线上来了，他们已经认识或开始认识到对那些不法奸商的改造和制裁，不但对整个国家人民有利，对他们自己的正当经营也是有利的。生意好做了，不用怕不法奸商的垄断操纵了，再不必用回扣、送礼等卑鄙手段，去和不法奸商争夺做生意的机会了。拥护工人阶级压服资产阶级进攻的人是绝大多数而且越来越多了。统一战线因为排挤了、改造与制裁了夹杂在其中的有害因素而更发展更巩固了。交朋友也是要讲道义的，只许进攻却不许压服无理的进攻，朋友也是交不好的。互相尊重确实是十分重要的，可惜许多不法资产阶级完全对不起人民对他们的尊重。有着若干不法资产阶级在人民政府或人民民主统一战线工作机构中担任重要负责职务，还有不少奸商充任人民代表会议的代表，或担任人民团体、特别是工商业联合会或各行业公会的主要负责职务。人民对他们的尊重和信任，不可谓为不深不厚，然而，很可惜，这种尊重和信任，反而变成便于他们违法营私、干出各种进攻国营经济、进攻工人阶级的卑鄙龌龊勾当的武器。那些侮辱了和辜负了人民的信任和尊重的人，大言不惭，还要人家保持对他们“尊重”，实在叫人齿冷。
    这种以“政论家”姿态发出来的、为资产阶级辩护的论调之旁，还有着另一种倒打一耙的伎俩。这一回是以谣言家的姿态出现了。他们说：“去年实行土改，今年实行商改了。”“要实行社会主义取消资本家了。”“公私授受不亲（即国营经济和私人经济断绝联系）了。”“下一步要搞小资产阶级了。”还有更无赖的，说是“不许吃好的了，有钱不许花了”。然而，既然是谣言，市场、寿命俱都有限。人如堕落到靠谣言吃饭，也就证明他们已经没落到可悲的程度了。
    各种辩护都无效，还准备下了最后一道防线，这就是摇身一变，变成一个衔冤莫白，委曲难伸的“受难者”了；他们说：“资产阶级要有气量，今天听凭人家去诬蔑，明天总可以拿事实来证明我们的清白的。”这里眼泪似乎“满眶”，可惜连老实人也看出那是挤出来的。明天改过，自然很好；过去猖狂进攻的事迹，铁案如山，班班可考，单靠挤出点眼泪，那是冲洗不掉的。
    收起一切谬论，老实悔过认罪，这是一条路；散布各种谰言，坚决进攻到底，这是另一条路。前一条路是资产阶级的康庄大道，后一条路已经“此路不通”。资产阶级及其代言人或辩护士应该猛省，这些继续进攻的武器还是放下为妙。（转载《学习》杂志一九五二年第二期，个别字句曾经作者稍作修改）
