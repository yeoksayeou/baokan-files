Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace Against American Aggression:

The second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty has sparked infinite hope in the hearts of the Vietnamese people. The Sino-Soviet Treaty has further strengthened the friendship between the two great nations of the Soviet Union and China, consolidated peace in Asia and the world, and boosted the confidence of all nations struggling for their liberation. The Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, pledge to unite with all the nations of the world, especially with the Khmer and Lao nations; and are determined to continue their protracted struggle to defend national independence and world peace. The Vietnamese people have confidence in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Marshal Stalin and China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong for the only glorious path that has been pointed out for mankind.

Down with aggressive war! Down with the American, British, and French imperialists who provoke war!

Long live world peace and democracy!

Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

Long live Vietnam-China-Soviet friendship!

    【新华社二十日讯】越中友好协会，越苏友好协会和越南保卫世界和平委员会联名致电中苏友好协会和中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，祝贺中苏友好条约签订二周年。电文如下：中苏友好协会中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会：
    中苏条约签订的第二周年在越南人民心中激发了无限的希望。中苏条约已使苏联与中国两大民族间的友谊更加紧密，巩固了亚洲和世界的和平，并且使奋起为自己的解放而斗争的各民族提高了信心。在胡志明主席领导之下的越南人民保证自己要与世界各民族团结，特别是要与高棉和寮国两民族团结起来；并决心要继续进行自己保卫国家独立与世界和平的持久斗争。越南人民对斯大林大元帅领导的苏联和毛泽东主席领导的中国为目前人类所已指出的唯一的光荣道路是具有信心的。
    打倒侵略战争！打倒战争挑拨者美、英、法帝国主义！
    世界和平与民主万岁！
    中苏友好万岁！
    越、中、苏友好万岁！
