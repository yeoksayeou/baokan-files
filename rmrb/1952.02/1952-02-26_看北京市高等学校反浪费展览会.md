Viewing the Anti-Waste Exhibition of Beijing Higher Education Institutions
Shi Yue

Some people say: "There is no major corruption or major waste in schools." "Waste is unintentional, so it is innocent." Others say: "Although waste causes losses, it cannot be compared with corruption." But the Anti-Waste Exhibition of Beijing Higher Education Institutions tells us: According to preliminary statistics, the total value of materials stockpiled, lost, and wasted by just ten universities in Beijing is an alarming amount - 50.8 billion yuan. This proves that not only is there waste in schools, but the amount wasted is not a small number; it proves that the losses caused to the country and the people by waste are extremely serious. Standing in front of piles of damaged valuable instruments and medicines, standing in front of huge amounts of stockpiled materials covered in dust, every conscientious person feels angry and heartbroken.

The exhibits point out that bureaucracy is not only a hotbed of corruption but also a direct cause of waste. Beijing Agricultural University has a forest farm with 290,000 seedlings. When the Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau was carrying out a project there, it was originally only necessary to remove a portion of the seedlings; however, due to the unforgivable bureaucracy on both sides, all 290,000 seedlings were cut down, resulting in a loss of 1 billion yuan and delaying the construction of windbreak forest belts to combat disasters and protect farmland for the motherland. In the construction of the Yan'an Building at the Beijing Institute of Technology, bureaucrats signed, stamped, and approved with their eyes closed, resulting in unscrupulous merchants defrauding 2.3 billion yuan from the 17 billion yuan construction budget by falsely reporting costs. In the actual project, the unscrupulous merchants stole another 2.5 billion yuan. The remaining money built "reinforced concrete" buildings like this: in the brick seams where the brick ash peels off, you can see the open fields outside; when the weather is bad, it rains heavily outside, and it drizzles inside; when the wind blows hard outside, a light breeze blows inside.

Through objects and pictures, we can see the unique "nation's first" instruments and machines of various schools. One is a complete radio station equipment in the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Engineering College of Peking University. It does not help the teaching work of the Department of Electrical Engineering in any way but has become a tool for the bourgeoisie to attack us, making it convenient for the major corrupt element Chen Yuede to embezzle. The Department of Electrical Engineering of the Engineering College of Tsinghua University has a high-voltage laboratory. This set of equipment is extremely valuable, but its role in Tsinghua University was only to be taken out for everyone to "appreciate" once during the National Day. Because of this, when the North China State-Owned Ceramics Company requested to cooperate with the laboratory, they demanded a cooperation fee of 150,000 jin of millet. Some responsible persons of emerging universities have also long been intoxicated with the illusion of being "the nation's first." The Department of Aviation of the Beijing Institute of Technology made a huge budget of 15 billion yuan and requested the Air Force Headquarters to allocate 80 aircraft, while there were only more than 40 students at that time; the physics department laboratory only needed to purchase one set of instruments, but when they learned that the physics department of the Peking University College of Science had six sets, they quickly bought six sets. Later, when they heard that the Shenyang Institute of Technology had fifteen sets, these professors who were riding on the clouds were planning to buy fifteen sets in their minds. Competing for funding was once a major event among the colleges and departments of Beijing's universities. The more funding one won, the more it showed the special status of one's college, department, and individual. The school leaders falsely reported and exaggerated to the Ministry of Education. After receiving the funds, the colleges competed with each other, and the departments competed with each other. Whenever funds were allocated, each college and department planned carefully and dispatched "eloquent" "generals" to defeat their opponents with "glib tongues." On the spot, they argued fiercely, refusing to give in, resulting in "getting emotional," "throwing hats," "walking away with a flick of the sleeve," everything happened. How was the funding that was received and fought for used? The exhibition has a good answer. Beijing Normal University spent 370 million yuan to buy machines to run an educational equipment manufacturing factory, but the machines have been shelved ever since they were bought. The Department of Agricultural Chemistry of Beijing Agricultural University has 10,000 test tubes in stock, but they still go out to buy them when they need them. When the Beijing College of Northern Jiaotong University reimbursed expenses, they bought three megaphones and eight loudspeakers with the extra money. The Department of Electrical Engineering of the Peking University College of Engineering stockpiled a large number of electrical instruments because "there are few foreign goods, and I am afraid I won't be able to buy them in the future." This method is no different from merchants hoarding goods for speculation.

The photos of the "warehouses" of various schools in the exhibition show: uniform chaos, uniform lack of management. The purpose of the "warehouse" is to put things in under such a principle: things that you don't need (including decorating the facade) and are unwilling to give to others; things that you need but can fight for funding to buy separately. Therefore, three large water meters worth 120 million yuan were found in the "scrap iron" pile in the "warehouse" of the Beijing Institute of Technology; 80,000 glass slides for experiments were found in the "garbage" pile in the "warehouse" of the Peking University Medical College. In the "warehouse" of the China Union Medical College, half a warehouse of drugs was destroyed. From the exhibits, you can see that these are red, white, brown, and black powders of various colors, and even the most skilled doctor cannot tell what they originally were. These things are not the gifts of the executioner Rockefeller; they are the blood and sweat of the working people of the motherland! Even more absurd is that a "warehouse" of the Peking University College of Engineering was not discovered for five years. Now, after opening it, nine unused machines have rusted beyond recognition.

Another way of wasting is to pursue "American standards" and "international standards." Under the erosion of bourgeois decadent ideas, the Department of Sanitary Engineering of the Peking University College of Engineering built a laboratory according to "American standards." Among the 220 million yuan of funding, the amount of waste reached 63 million yuan. The first thing they considered was not to train more talents for the country with the least amount of funding, but to pursue "beauty" and "generosity" everywhere. They were unwilling to buy an ordinary refrigerator for 3 million yuan and would rather spend 18 million yuan to buy an old electric refrigerator. Wooden benches and faucets must meet "American standards," but each experimental table costing 10 million yuan had already cracked a big seam in the middle before it was even used once.

Part of the exhibits was shattered in the infighting of "sects." The Peking University Institute of Arts had so-called three major "mountain strongholds." Since liberation, these "mountain strongholds" have been pressing down on the antiques in the Institute of Arts, and they are insurmountable to each other. No one can manage anyone. Under such circumstances, under the guise of "research," the crystallization of the wisdom of the ancient Chinese working people - the cultural treasure that we are proud of as a nation - the Yuan Dynasty murals were damaged by water in the basement; the Tang Dynasty ancient steles were weathered; the Qing Dynasty historical materials became "fossils"; and dog kennels were made on ancient Wei steles. Because of the division between the "Peking University" and "Tsinghua" factions, Beijing Agricultural University watched as the flood submerged the underground warehouse, and watched as the wealth accumulated by the working people's early rising and late sleeping was destroyed in the water. This is a brutal act that no one can tolerate!

The most heartbreaking thing is the serious phenomenon of stockpiling, which can really make people cry. In the Yellow River control project, which concerns the lives and property of millions of people, we lack high-horsepower diesel engines. But here - in the corner of the machine factory of the Peking University College of Engineering, there is a 120-horsepower diesel engine discarded. The sacred requirement of the motherland for young people - to be both moral and talented, physically sound, and have a high degree of communist consciousness. However, some brain-resting gentlemen in the Tsinghua University Library have stockpiled 1,000 copies of political books for three years, while letting those yellow and reactionary books be placed on the shelves, spreading the toxins of bourgeois decadent and corrupt ideas. Everything is for production. When the worker comrades brave the high heat to climb into the steelmaking furnace to repair it; when the worker comrades use their high wisdom to turn waste materials into machines, the professors of the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Peking University College of Engineering are "skillfully" disassembling the parts of complete paper-making machines, leather-making machines, soap-making machines, and paint-making machines, and "proudly" installing them on other machines. Everyone who has seen the exhibits and pictures of the anti-US and aid Korea front is moved by the great and noble spirit of the volunteer comrades in cherishing the property of the motherland. They used the iron shovels until almost only a wooden handle remained; they used the foot-long pickaxes until only three or four inches remained; they wrote quick-clapper poems on leaves. But our universities are stockpiling many items that the volunteers need: Peking University, stockpiling 296 oxygen cylinders necessary for high-altitude flight, 19 precise sights, 6 megaphones, 5 military radio receivers; China Union Medical College, stockpiling 300 kilograms of Vitamin B worth 3 billion yuan, 13,200 boxes of anti-inflammatory tablets; Tsinghua University, stockpiling more than 100 magneto telephones; Fu Jen Catholic University, stockpiling 510 reams of newsprint!

The exhibition tells us: we must hate waste and bureaucratic phenomena with the same feelings as we hate corrupt elements.

The exhibition tells us: we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois ideology entrenched in schools.

    看北京市高等学校反浪费展览会
    石越
    有人说：“在学校中没有大贪污，也没有大浪费。”“浪费是无意的，所以是无罪的。”或者又说：“浪费虽然造成损失，到底和贪污不能相比。”但是北京市高等学校反浪费展览告诉我们：据初步统计，仅仅北京的十所高等学校积压、损失、浪费物资总值是一个惊人的数目——五百零八亿元。这证明在学校中不但有浪费，而且所浪费的并不是一个微小的数目；证明浪费给国家、人民所带来的损失是极其严重的。站在一堆堆损毁了的贵重的仪器和药品面前，站在布满灰尘的巨量积压物资面前，每个有良心的人，都感到愤怒和痛心。
    展览物指出：官僚主义不但是贪污的温床，也是浪费的直接造成者。北京农业大学的一片林场，培养有树苗二十九万株。当北京市人民政府卫生工程局在该处进行一项工程时，本来只需移去一部分树苗就够了；但由于双方不可饶恕的官僚主义，这二十九万株树苗被全部砍掉了，损失了十亿元，并推迟了祖国战胜灾荒的护田林带的建设。北京工业学院在建造延安大楼的工程中，官僚主义者闭着眼睛签名、盖章、批准，结果一百七十亿元的建筑费中被奸商虚报成本骗去了二十三亿元。在实际工程中奸商又盗窃了二十五亿元。剩下的钱盖成的“钢筋水泥”建筑是这样的：在砖灰剥落的砖缝中，可以看到外边的旷野；天气不好时，外边下大雨，里边下小雨；外边刮大风，里边刮小风。
    借着实物、图片，我们可以看到各学校所特有的“全国第一”的仪器和机器。一件是北京大学工学院电机系一个完整的无线电台装备。它对电机系的教学工作并无任何帮助，反而成为资产阶级思想向我们进攻的工具，使该系大贪污犯陈阅德得到了贪污的方便。清华大学工学院电机系有一个高压实验室，这套装备是极其珍贵的，但它在清华大学所起的作用，只在国庆时曾拿出来给大家“观赏”了一次。正因为如此，所以当华北国营窑业公司要求和该实验室合作时，他们竟要索取十五万斤小米的合作费。一些新兴的大学的某些负责者也早已把自己陶醉在“全国第一”的幻想中了。北京工业学院航空系作下了一百五十亿的庞大预算，并要求空军司令部拨交飞机八十架，而当时同学才共四十余人；物理系实验室仪器只需要添购一套就够了，但当一知道北京大学理学院物理系有六套时，就赶紧买足六套，后来一听沈阳工学院有十五套，这些腾云驾雾的教授们的肚中又盘算着买十五套的计划了。争经费这曾是北京各学校院、系间的一件大事。争得经费愈多，就愈显示出自己院、系和个人的特殊地位。学校领导方面向教育部虚报、浮领，领来之后，院和院争，系和系争。每当分配经费的时候，各院各系都计划周密，派遣“能言善辩”的“大将”出马，用“如簧之舌”来击败对手。当场争得面红耳赤相持不下，结果“闹意气”、“掼纱帽”、“拂袖而去”，什么都有。这样领来、争来的经费是怎样用去的呢？展览会有很好的答复。北京师范大学用三亿七千万元买了机器，办一个教育用具制造厂，可是机器买来后就一直被搁置着。北京农业大学农业化学系存有试管一万个，但需要的时候仍旧到外面去买。北方交通大学京院在报销经费时，把多余的钱买了三个扩音器、八个喇叭。北京大学工学院电机系因为“外国货少，恐怕以后买不到”，囤积了大量电用仪器。这种手段已和囤积居奇的商人相差无几了。
    展览的各学校“仓库”的照片，它说明：一律的杂乱，一律的无人管理。“仓库”的用途就是在这样的一个原则下把东西放进去：自己不需要（包括装璜门面）又不肯给别人的东西；自己虽需要而可以争到经费去另买的东西。所以在北京工业学院
    “仓库”的“废铁”堆里清理出了价值一亿二千万元的大水表三只；在北京大学医学院“仓库”的“垃圾”堆里发现了八万张做实验用的玻璃片。中国协和医学院的“仓库”中，有半仓库药品毁坏了，从陈列品中可以看见这是一些红、白、棕、黑各色的粉末，再高明的医生也分辨不出这原来是什么了。这些东西并不是刽子手洛克菲勒的恩赐，是祖国劳动人民的血汗啊！更荒谬的是北京大学工学院有一个“仓库”五年来居然未被发现，现在打开之后，九台没有用过的机器已经锈得面目全非。
    浪费的另一条路就是追求“美国标准”、“国际水准”。北京大学工学院卫生工程系在资产阶级腐朽思想的侵蚀下，按“美国标准”建造了一个实验室。在二亿二千万元经费中，浪费数字达六千三百万元。他们首先考虑到的不是用最少的经费为国家培养更多的人材，而是处处追求“漂亮”，“大方”，不愿用三百万元买一只普通冰箱，宁愿化一千八百万元买一只旧的电器冰箱。木凳、水龙头都要合乎“美国标准”，但是每台一千万元的实验台，还没有用过一次中间就已经裂开一条大缝。
    陈列品的一部分是在“宗派”的倾轧中被粉碎了的。北京大学文科研究所，有所谓三大“山头”。这些“山头”解放以来一直压在文科研究所的古物上，彼此不可逾越，谁也不能管谁。在这种情况下，在“研究”的美名下，中国古代劳动人民智慧的结晶——我们引为民族骄傲的文化宝藏——元代的壁画在地下室被水浸坏了；唐代的古碑被风化了；清代的史料变成了“化石”；古代的魏碑上做着狗窝。北京农业大学由于有“北大”、“清华”派的分裂，他们眼看着大水淹没地下仓库，眼看着劳动人民起早睡晚积累点滴劳动创造的财富毁坏在水中。这是谁也不能容忍的粗暴行为！
    最可痛心的，是严重的积压现象，看了真能使人流泪。在关系千百万人民性命、财产的治黄工程中，我们缺少马力巨大的柴油机。但在这里——北京大学工学院机工厂的角落里却弃置着一台一百二十匹马力的柴油机。祖国对青年神圣的要求——德才兼备，体魄健全，具有高度共产主义觉悟。可是清华大学图书馆某些脑筋休息着的先生们把一千册政治书籍积压了三年，而让那些黄色、反动的书籍放在书架上，散布着资产阶级堕落、腐化思想的毒素。一切为生产，当工人同志冒着高热爬进炼钢炉去修理的时候；当工人同志用高度的智慧把废料变成机器的时候，北京大学工学院化工系的教授们却正在“巧妙”地把完整的造纸机、制革机、肥皂机、油漆机上的零件拆下来，“骄傲”地把它安到别的机器上去。每个看过抗美援朝前线实物、图片展览的人，都为志愿军同志伟大、崇高的爱护祖国财产的精神所感动。他们把铁铲用得几乎只剩一把木柄；他们把一尺长的镐头用到只剩三、四寸；他们把快板诗写在树叶上。但我们的高等学校里却积压着许多志愿军所必需的物品：北京大学，积压着二百九十六个高空飞行所必须的氧气筒、十九件精确的瞄准器、六个喊话筒、五部军用收报机；中国协和医学院，积压着价值三十亿元的维他命B三百公斤、消炎片一万三千二百盒；清华大学，积压着磁石电话机一百多台；辅仁大学，积压着白报纸五百十令！
    展览会告诉我们：必须用憎恶贪污分子的心情去憎恶浪费和官僚主义现象。
    展览会告诉我们：必须坚决、彻底地清除盘踞在学校里的资产阶级思想。
