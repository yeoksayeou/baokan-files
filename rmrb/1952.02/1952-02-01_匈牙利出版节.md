Hungarian Publishing Festival

The Hungarian people will warmly celebrate the first Hungarian Publishing Festival today.

February 1st is the anniversary of the founding of "Free People" (Szabad Nép) in 1942, the central organ of the Hungarian Communist Party (which merged with the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in June 1948 to form the Hungarian Working People's Party). "Free People" will also celebrate its tenth anniversary on this day.

Hungarian newspapers and periodicals have made significant contributions to the great achievements of the Hungarian people. Since liberation, Hungarian newspapers, learning from the example of Soviet newspapers, and with the constant care and assistance of Comrade Rákosi and the Party, have exerted a widespread influence among the working masses.

Hungarian newspapers are a collective propagandist and agitator, mobilizing the Hungarian people in every way to fight for world peace, to complete the Five-Year Plan, and to expose and combat the conspiracies of the enemy. Hungarian newspapers maintain close ties with their readers. They use all means to disseminate and promote rationalization proposals and the Stakhanovite movement.

"Free People," the central organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party, is an unyielding fighter for proletarian internationalism and loyalty to the Soviet Union, and a powerful weapon for safeguarding Hungarian freedom and independence and building socialism. Other publications, such as the trade union organ "People's Voice," the Budapest Municipal Committee organ "Light," the military organ "People's Army," and the youth education paper "Free Youth," also have the same clear purpose. In addition, there are various mass periodicals, 72 factory Party newspapers, 18 trade union newspapers, 121 science and technology magazines, and newspapers published in minority languages.

The most significant indication of the Hungarian press's connection with the masses is the increase in the number of correspondents. Many workers send their criticisms and suggestions to the press. Last year, Hungarian Party newspapers and mass organization newspapers received more than 200,000 letters from worker and peasant correspondents. After celebrating the first Publishing Festival, Hungary will hold its first national conference of newspaper correspondents on February 2nd and 3rd to strengthen the connection between the press and the workers and to open up new sources of contributions for newspapers and periodicals.

### 匈牙利出版节

    匈牙利出版节
    匈牙利人民将在今天热烈地庆祝匈牙利第一届出版节。
    二月一日是匈牙利共产党（一九四八年六月与匈牙利社会民主党合并为劳动人民党）的中央机关报“自由人民”报在一九四二年创刊的日期。“自由人民”报也将在这一天庆祝它的创刊十周年。
    在匈牙利人民所获得的巨大成就中，匈牙利的报刊有着重大的贡献。由于在匈牙利解放以后学习苏联报刊的榜样，由于得到拉科西同志与党的经常关怀和帮助，匈牙利的报刊在工人群众中产生了普遍的影响。
    匈牙利报刊是一个集体的宣传者和鼓动者，它用一切方式来动员匈牙利人民为争取世界和平、为完成五年计划、为揭露和打击敌人的阴谋而斗争。匈牙利报刊和读者群众有着密切的联系。它用一切方式来传播和推广合理化建议、斯塔哈诺夫运动。
    匈牙利劳动人民党的中央机关报——“自由人民”报，是无产阶级国际主义的和忠诚于苏联的不屈不挠的战士，它是维护匈牙利自由与独立和建设社会主义的有力武器。其他如工会的机关报“人民语言”，布达佩斯市委机关报“光明”报，军队机关报“人民军”，教育青年的“自由青年”报等也都具有同样鲜明的目的。另外，尚有群众性的各种期刊，工厂的党报七十二种，工会报纸十八种，科学技术杂志一百二十一种，还有以少数民族文字出版的报纸。
    最足以表明匈牙利报刊联系群众的特征的，就是通讯员人数的增加。许多工人都把他们的批评与建议寄给报刊。去年匈牙利的党报与群众组织的报纸收到了由工人、农民通讯员寄来的二十万封以上的信件。在庆祝第一届出版节以后，匈牙利将在二月二日和三日召开全国报刊的第一次通讯员会议，以加强报刊与工人的连系，并为报纸、刊物增辟新的稿源。
