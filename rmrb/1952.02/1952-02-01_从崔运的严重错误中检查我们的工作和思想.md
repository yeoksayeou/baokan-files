    Examining Our Work and Thinking from Cui Yun's Serious Mistakes
    Wei Shizhen, Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Editor's Note: Cui Yun, Secretary-General of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, without authorization, misappropriated (borrowed) 2.25 billion yuan of national construction funds and 1 billion yuan of residents' relocation deposit to engage in production by government organs. He also displayed serious extravagance and waste in handling the internal life of the organs, such as spending 40 million yuan to build two greenhouses and 130 million yuan to build elaborate cowsheds. These were all erroneous acts that seriously harmed the interests of the state and the people. In response, Cui Yun voluntarily confessed his mistakes and made a preliminary self-criticism at the Third Representative Conference of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in November 1951 and at the Third Representative Conference of the Shijiazhuang Party in December of the same year. He also wrote two letters requesting the Hebei Provincial Committee to impose disciplinary action. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided, with the approval of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to remove Cui Yun from the position of Secretary-General of the Municipal Committee. This article is a review by the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of this incident.

    At the Third Representative Conference of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and all the delegates seriously exposed and criticized Comrade Cui Yun, Secretary-General of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee, for his serious errors in leading organ production, violating financial regulations, illegally misappropriating public funds, and benefiting the small collective at the expense of the larger collective, as well as the extravagance and waste within the organs. This made me deeply aware of the seriousness of the erosion of our Party by bourgeois ideology. At the same time, it made our Municipal Committee realize that we had serious bureaucracy, which led to our failure to discover and correct Comrade Cui Yun's mistakes in a timely manner, and this should be reviewed.

    Comrade Cui Yun is a Party member with a relatively long history in the Party, and in the past, he fought against the enemy under the White Terror and spent a long time in prison, making certain contributions to the revolution. However, due to Comrade Cui Yun's long-standing individualism and his desire for comfort, coupled with his own lack of attention to study and irregular participation in Party organizational life, and our lack of regular inspection and specific assistance to his work, Comrade Cui Yun became infected with bourgeois ideology after entering the city. He repeatedly violated laws and regulations in managing organ production, seriously harming the interests of the state and the people. In addition, his extravagance and waste in handling organ life encouraged some comrades to compare enjoyment, compare treatment, and make ostentatious displays.

    Comrade Cui Yun is the Secretary-General of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee. We not only failed to detect and correct his mistakes early on, but sometimes, because our thinking was unhealthy, we even fostered the development of his mistakes. Therefore, we bear great responsibility for Comrade Cui Yun's mistakes and should admit our mistakes to the Party and the people, and we are willing to accept the criticism and punishment of the higher-level Party organization. Our biggest mistake was treating organ production with a non-political perspective, failing to oversee or inspect the organ production of our own organs, thus depriving organ production of political leadership and political supervision, giving Comrade Cui Yun the opportunity to act arbitrarily and violate laws and regulations. This is a concrete manifestation of our lack of a sense of responsibility for state property. Secondly, in terms of organ life, expenditures exceeded the budget by more than three times in the past year, a large part of which was waste. Major extravagance and waste facilities were mostly presided over and initiated by Comrade Cui Yun himself; although we knew about some things, we did not resolutely stop them; and we turned a blind eye to some things, even expressing our approval. Some comrades in the organ repeatedly raised objections to Comrade Cui Yun's extravagance and waste, but we did not pay attention to these opinions. This shows that the influence of bourgeois ideology on ourselves is also serious. In addition, the relationship between us and Comrade Cui Yun was also abnormal, lacking principled struggle. In the past, we also knew that Comrade Cui Yun had many shortcomings, such as being lax in his life, loving comfort, disliking studying, and often dwelling on trivial matters and extravagant displays, but we did not raise these phenomena to the level of political principles. We often attributed them to personal lifestyle and work ability, and often accommodated and excused him because he had spent many years in the enemy's prison, damaging his health and mental capacity. This vulgar liberal attitude condoned Comrade Cui Yun's erroneous thinking, causing him to sink deeper and deeper into the mire. We failed to fulfill the duties of the Party committee and did not sincerely help Comrade Cui Yun to progress from the standpoint of comrades. This is a political error.

    Why did we make the above mistakes? The main reason is that our class stance was unstable. As early as the beginning of 1949, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee instructed the entire Party to be vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois ideology and style. We lacked a true understanding of this point, so we numbly watched as the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie hit us one by one, allowing it to erode our Party organization. It was clear that in the past two years, the ideas of learning to be "generous," emphasizing form, and pursuing enjoyment have been growing in the minds of some of our comrades, and have developed to a considerable extent in the case of Comrade Cui Yun and some others, but we have turned a blind eye to this and lacked vigilance, causing irreparable losses to our Party.

    In short, from the mistakes made by Comrade Cui Yun, we have discovered serious shortcomings and errors in our ideological work, which has given us an extremely painful lesson. If we do not thoroughly examine and correct the shortcomings and errors in our ideological work, it will be difficult for us to shoulder the glorious and arduous political tasks assigned to us by the Party in the future. We resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and under the leadership of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we actively participate in and lead the city's movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In this movement, on the one hand, with the help of all Party members, cadres, and the people of the city, we will thoroughly examine and correct the shortcomings and errors in our ideological work and other work; on the other hand, we will actively lead all cadres and all Party members, under the supervision and help of the masses, to thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, thoroughly eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucratic style, and resolutely smash the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on us. We will promote a style of honesty, public service, hard work, and simplicity, so that any sugar-coated bullets will have no chance to hit us.

### 从崔运的严重错误中检查我们的工作和思想

    从崔运的严重错误中检查我们的工作和思想
    中共石家庄市委书记　魏士珍
    编者按：中国共产党石家庄市委秘书长崔运擅自挪用（息借）国家修建费二十二亿五千万元，居民迁移费存款十亿元，搞机关生产；在处理机关内部生活上则有严重的铺张浪费现象，如用四千万元修筑了两个花房，用一亿三千万元，修建讲究的奶牛棚，这都是严重损害国家人民利益的错误行为。对此，崔运已经在一九五一年十一月间召开的中共河北省的第三次代表会议上，和同年十二月间召开的石家庄党的第三次代表会议上，自动进行了坦白，作了初步反省，并两次写信请求河北省委给以处分。中共河北省委已决定并经中共中央华北局批准，撤销崔运的市委秘书长职务。这篇文章，就是中共石家庄市委对这一事件的检讨。
    在中共石家庄市第三次代表会议上，中共石家庄市委和全体代表同志，严肃地揭发和批判了石家庄市委秘书长崔运同志在领导机关生产中所犯的违反财政制度，非法挪用公款，损大公肥小公的严重错误行为和机关内部的铺张浪费现象。这使我深刻地认识了资产阶级思想对我们党的侵蚀的严重性。同时使我们市委认识到自己存在着严重的官僚主义，以致未能及时发觉和纠正崔运同志的错误，这都是应作检讨的。
    崔运同志是一个党龄较长的党员，过去曾在白色恐怖下和敌人作过斗争，并坐过很长时间的牢狱，对革命有过一定的贡献。但由于崔运同志长期存在着个人英雄主义及贪图享受的思想，加上他自己不注意学习和不经常过党的组织生活；同时我们对他的工作缺乏经常的检查和具体的帮助，致使崔运同志进城后，沾染了资产阶级思想。在经营机关生产中一再违法乱纪，严重地损害了国家人民的利益。另外，他在处理机关生活上铺张浪费，助长了某些同志的比享受、比待遇、闹排场的思想。
    崔运同志是石家庄市委秘书长。对于他的错误，我们不但未能及早觉察予以纠正，甚至有时因为我们的思想不健康，而助长了他的错误的发展。因此，我们对崔运同志的错误是负有很大责任的，应当向党向人民承认自己的错误，并愿接受上级党的组织的批评和处分。我们最大的错误就是以非政治观点对待机关生产，对本机关的机关生产不加过问，不加检查，因而使机关生产失掉了政治领导和政治监督，给崔运同志以独断专行、违法乱纪的机会。这是我们对国家财产缺乏责任感的具体表现。其次，在机关生活上，一年来经费超支三倍多，其中有很大一部分是浪费。重大的铺张浪费设施多由崔运同志自己主持、倡办；有些事我们虽然知道，但没有坚决制止；有些事我们则熟视无睹，甚至表示赞同。机关内有些同志对崔运同志的铺张浪费行为一再提出意见，但我们并没有重视这些意见。这说明我们自己所受的资产阶级思想影响也是严重的。此外，我们和崔运同志之间的关系也不正常，缺乏原则性的斗争。过去我们也知道崔运同志有不少缺点，例如生活散漫，爱享受，不好学习，常在琐屑事务及铺张陈设上打圈子等等，但是没有把这些现象提到政治原则上来看，往往笼统地归之于个人生活作风及工作能力问题，并常因他坐了多年的敌人的监牢，损坏了身体和脑力，而多方迁就和原谅。这种庸俗的自由主义态度，纵容了崔运同志的错误思想，使他在泥坑中愈陷愈深。我们没有尽到党委的职责，没有站在同志的立场上热诚地帮助崔运同志进步，这是政治上的错误。
    我们为什么会犯以上的错误呢？主要是由于阶级立场不稳，本来，毛主席和党中央早在一九四九年初就指示全党警惕资产阶级思想作风的腐蚀，对于这一点，我们缺乏真正的了解，因此，麻木不仁地看着资产阶级的糖衣炮弹一颗一颗地打来，而让它侵蚀我们党的组织。明明近两年来在我们一些同志的思想中日益滋长着学“大方”、讲形式和追求享受的思想，而且像崔运同志和另外一些人还发展得相当严重，但我们对此熟视无睹，缺乏警觉，这给我们党造成了不可弥补的损失。
    总之，从崔运同志所犯的错误中，我们发现了我们思想工作中存在着严重的缺点和错误，这给了我们一个极其沉痛的教训。如果我们还不彻底检查和纠正我们思想工作中的缺点和错误，今后就很难负担起党所给予的光荣艰巨的政治任务。我们坚决响应毛主席和党中央的号召，在中共中央华北局和中共河北省委的领导下，积极参加和领导全市的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动。在这一运动中，一方面在全体党员、干部及全市人民的帮助下彻底检查和纠正我们的思想工作及其他工作中的缺点和错误；另一方面积极带领全体干部、全体党员，在群众的监督和帮助下，彻底肃清资产阶级思想的影响，彻底肃清贪污浪费及官僚主义作风，坚决粉碎资产阶级对我们的猖狂进攻。发扬廉洁奉公、艰苦朴素的作风，使任何糖衣炮弹无隙可击。
