    Beijing Municipal People's Government Arrests Major Embezzler Zheng Zipan
    Zheng Used His Position as People's Representative and CPPCC Member to Extort Huge Sums of Money
    On the 4th of this month, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, according to law, arrested Zheng Zipan, a major embezzler who used his position as a district people's representative and CPPCC member to extort huge sums of money from the people and refused to confess.

    Zheng Zipan is a major rogue who has consistently extorted and oppressed the people. After the liberation of Beijing, he feigned progress in the work of promoting People's Victory Indexed Bonds, etc., and became a representative of the people from all walks of life in the First District of Beijing and a member of the CPPCC. From then on, he used his powers to intimidate and oppress the people, swindling everywhere, seriously damaging the prestige of the People's Government and the People's Representative Conference among the masses. In early 1950, when the Central People's Government issued People's Victory Indexed Bonds, Zheng Zipan took the opportunity to seize the position of deputy director of the bond promotion committee in the First District of Beijing. He once forced Zhou Xingkun, the agent of Hengdeli Watch Company, to subscribe to 30,000 shares of bonds under false pretenses. Then, he secretly told Zhou Xingkun: As long as you take out 3,000 US dollars, I can lobby the cadres to reduce the bond score. He also deliberately frightened Zhou Xingkun, saying, "You don't understand the Communist Party and the People's Government. If you directly ask the government to reduce the bond score, not only will it not be reduced, but it will also increase." At that time, Zhou Xingkun did not understand the policies of the People's Government and was frightened by this rogue. As a result, he gave Zheng Zipan 29 taels of gold and 2,000 US dollars. In this way, Zheng reduced Hengdeli Watch Company's bond score to 8,000 shares. At that time, in order to raise funds, Zhou Xingkun, through Zheng's introduction, sold a house to the Zhongnan Bank, and the payment for the house was 3,400 bolts of cloth. After the house was sold, Zheng was still not satisfied and extorted 1,000 bolts of Five Blessings cloth from Zhou Xingkun, worth about 240 million yuan, as "remuneration" for him. Zheng used the same deceptive method to extort 43 million yuan from the Gao Yisheng and Gao Bohai brothers, and then privately reduced their bond subscriptions. In addition, Zheng openly gambled, lent money at usurious rates, and maliciously incited and undermined the relationship between the government and the people.

    After Beijing launched the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in a big way, the First District's Thrift Inspection Committee had already grasped Zheng's criminal materials, but still repeatedly persuaded and educated him, and mobilized him to confess and repent. However, Zheng refused to confess and actively sabotaged the movement. He once found Zhou Xingkun of Hengdeli Watch Company, attempting to form a "defense alliance" with Zhou. He also went to Tianjin to find Gao Bohai, expressing his willingness to return 30 million yuan to him. However, Zheng's conspiracies failed, and his criminal facts were finally exposed by the people. The First District Thrift Inspection Committee convened a meeting to struggle against corrupt elements on the 4th, attended by representatives of the District People's Congress, CPPCC members, and representatives and activists from various streets and units. The masses present were extremely indignant and unanimously demanded that the People's Government arrest and punish this major embezzler according to law. The First District Thrift Inspection Committee accepted everyone's request and immediately reported to the Municipal People's Government to arrest Zheng on the spot. With the approval of all the people's representatives attending the meeting, he was removed from his position as a CPPCC member, and the First District People's Government also terminated his qualification as a specially invited representative.

    北京市人民政府逮捕大贪污犯郑子磐
    郑犯曾利用人民代表和协商委员职权勒索巨款
    北京市人民政府本月四日依法逮捕了利用区人民代表和协商委员的职权，向人民敲诈勒索巨款，而又拒不坦白的大贪污分子郑子磐。
    郑子磐是一个大流氓，一贯敲诈和欺压人民。北京解放后，他在推销人民胜利折实公债等工作中，伪装进步，当了北京市第一区各界人民代表会议的代表和协商委员会的委员。从此他就利用自己的职权，吓唬、欺压人民，到处招摇撞骗，严重地损害了人民政府和人民代表会议在群众中的威信。一九五○年初中央人民政府发行人民胜利折实公债时，郑子磐乘机窃据了北京市第一区公债推销委员会副主任的职位。他曾假借名义，向亨得利钟表行代理人周兴坤强迫摊派了三万分公债。然后又暗地里向周兴坤说：只要你拿出美金三千元，我可以代你向干部活动，设法减少公债的分数。他还故意吓唬周兴坤说：“你不了解共产党和人民政府，如果你直接向政府请求减少公债分数，不但不会减，而且还会增加。”当时周兴坤还不了解人民政府的政策，便被这个流氓吓住了。结果，他给了郑子磐二十九两黄金和两千元美金。这样，郑犯便把亨得利钟表行的公债分数减为八千分。当时周兴坤为了筹集款项，又由郑犯介绍，将一所房子卖给中南银行，房款是三千四百匹布。在房子出卖后，郑犯还不知足，又向周兴坤强索五福布一千匹，约合两亿四千万元，作为对他的“报酬”。郑犯用同样的欺骗办法，向高怡生和高渤海兄弟敲诈勒索了四千三百万元，然后私自减低他们认购公债的分数。此外郑犯还公开聚赌，放高利贷，恶意地挑拨破坏政府和人民的关系。
    北京市大张旗鼓地展开反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动以后，第一区节约检查委员会虽早已掌握了郑犯的犯罪材料，但仍一再对他进行说服教育，动员他坦白悔过。但是郑犯拒不坦白，并积极破坏运动。他曾经找到亨得利钟表行的周兴坤，企图和周订立“攻守同盟”。他还跑到天津去找高渤海，表示愿意退给他三千万元。但是郑犯的这些阴谋鬼计都失败了，他的犯罪事实终于被人民揭发出来。第一区节约检查委员会在四日召开了斗争贪污分子大会，出席会议的有区人民代表会议的代表、协商委员和各街道各单位的代表和积极分子。到会群众异常愤慨，一致要求人民政府将这个大贪污犯逮捕法办。第一区节约检查委员会接受大家的请求，当即报请市人民政府将郑犯当场逮捕，并经出席会议的全体人民代表通过，罢免了他的协商委员的职务，一区人民政府也解除了他的特邀代表的资格。
