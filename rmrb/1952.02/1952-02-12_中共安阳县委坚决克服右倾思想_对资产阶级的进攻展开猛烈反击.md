    Editor's Note: Some leading cadres in medium and small cities believe that "big tigers" are likely to be found in large cities, and that "big tigers" cannot be hidden in medium and small cities, or that there are few "big tigers." The material from Anyang County refutes this rightist thinking with irrefutable facts. The CPC Anyang County Committee initially planned to catch only five major embezzlers; after catching six, they once thought it was "almost enough." After criticism from higher authorities, they reversed this rightist sentiment, caught twenty-five major embezzlers, and also caught a group of major thieves in the industrial and commercial sectors. They are still carefully studying the enemy's situation and continuing to fight. However, in other regions, some medium and small cities, and even some units in certain large cities, still have this rightist sentiment. This rightist sentiment is manifested in: insufficient assessment of the enemy's situation, mere empty talk without entering the battle, or reluctantly fighting without the determination, confidence, and resolve, or wanting to withdraw after a small victory. All cadres with this rightist sentiment should immediately correct themselves in the manner of Anyang.

    Anyang County Town (Shuiye) has more than 300 industrial and commercial households and is a relatively prosperous small town. In the past two or three years, many illegal capitalists have launched a rampant attack on the Communist Party organization and the People's Government of Anyang County.

    The main targets of the bourgeoisie's offensive are
    State economic departments
    Their main targets of attack are economic departments such as the Tax Bureau, banks, and supply and marketing cooperatives. In order to evade taxes and steal state assets, they did not hesitate to adopt all kinds of most vile and shameless means. For example, the unscrupulous merchant Li Jianguo often brought sugar and peanuts when he went to government offices, giving them to anyone he saw; sometimes when cadres went to restaurants to eat, someone would suddenly send a bowl of meat, saying it was "compliments" from a certain manager or boss. Some unscrupulous merchants would grab cadres from banks and tax bureaus as they passed by the door and drag them into the counter to offer tea and meals. When the bank built an office building, more than 20 private merchants hurriedly set off firecrackers and sent plaques to "congratulate" them. This is the first step in their seduction of cadres. The next step is further courting and bribery. In order to bribe cadres, the unscrupulous merchant Li Jianguo went to Shanghai specifically to buy a box of things, including as many as fifty-four raincoats, as well as various daily necessities such as pens and watches, and even soap and combs, as well as small drums and trumpets for family members and children. These "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie were launched at us so pervasively and hit many people with weak wills in the revolutionary ranks. For example, Wang Xun, the director of the Tax Bureau, was hooked by Li Jianguo. Li Jianguo then further courted him, allowing one of Wang Xun's younger sisters and a child to live in his house and take care of their meals. Li also taught his children to call Wang Xun "Uncle Wang." After the unscrupulous merchant Li Jianguo captured Wang Xun with these shameful and vile methods, he evaded taxes in large quantities. In 1951 alone, he owed more than 70 million yuan in taxes, which has not been repaid to this day. Wang Xun knew about it clearly, but he did not demand it. Another way for the bourgeoisie to win over cadres is to absorb them as "shareholders," and then "pull them over," turning these people into economic spies hidden within us who listen to their commands. Wang Jiazhi of the Tax Bureau was destroyed by this vicious method of the bourgeoisie and became a despicable traitor. It has now been found that six unscrupulous merchants have made him a shareholder, and then the merchants used threats to make Wang frequently leak economic intelligence to them. Just once leaking the economic secret that tax stamps were about to increase in price caused the state to lose tens of millions of yuan. Wang Jiazhi embezzled and accepted bribes totaling 12 million yuan, and the merchants evaded taxes amounting to 1 billion yuan. In 1951 alone, illegal capitalists in the entire Shuiye Town evaded taxes worth 9 billion yuan. This money could buy six fighter planes, equivalent to one-third of Anyang County's annual agricultural tax. What a huge loss this is! Wang Wanhe, deputy manager of the supply and marketing cooperative's promotion department, was lured into becoming a "shareholder" by three unscrupulous merchants using "beauty traps." They also stole public funds and economic intelligence through Wang Wanhe. When salt was about to rise in price, Wang Wanhe would notify the unscrupulous merchants to buy salt, and when cloth was about to rise in price, he would notify the unscrupulous merchants to buy cloth. Wang Youzhi, the manager of the supply department, was defeated by the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets," and privately gave 30 million yuan of public funds and 13,200 jin of millet to private merchants to sell drugs. The merchants also often let him smoke "laohai" (opium). Wang Youzhi thus slipped into the bourgeoisie's mire of corruption and depravity.

    The most serious unit for embezzlement in the supply and marketing cooperative is the cotton purchasing station. Among them, most of the embezzlers were originally local private merchants and brokers who "drilled in" or were "sent in" when we purchased cotton last year, using people without asking about political conditions and with a purely technical point of view. They were incorrigible embezzlers. During the anti-corruption struggle, when everyone was holding meetings and fighting "big tigers" outside, there were still two embezzlers taking advantage of the chaos, hiding at home to steal cotton. These private merchants who "drilled in" had extensive connections with local private merchants. When purchasing cotton, many "cotton peddlers" were their "own people," colluding to make trouble together. Wang Chengshu, the cotton station's accountant, was an economic spy sent by his father (the unscrupulous merchant) Wang Cunren. After arriving at the cotton station, he stole economic intelligence, embezzled public funds, and sold cotton, speculating and monopolizing the market. As a result, in less than two years, he became a "tycoon."

    The merchants also did not relax their attacks on government departments

    The bourgeoisie's focus on corrupting government departments was on units in charge of the economy and some leading figures with weak wills. For example, Huang Yaoming, secretary of the county people's government, was corrupted by the unscrupulous merchant Li Jianguo, causing great losses to state assets. Li Jianguo began by sending gifts to Huang Yaoming to lure him, and under the guise of doing business with the public sector, he defrauded him of 8 million yuan in RMB twice. Later, Li Jianguo said that production was losing money, and not only did he not give dividends, but he also delayed paying back the principal. Later, he bribed Huang Yaoming's mother, gave Huang Yaoming watches and bought pens, bought things for Huang's children, became sworn relatives, and let Huang's wife and mother live in his house, attacking Huang Yaoming step by step. When Li Jianguo believed that Huang Yaoming had already fallen into the trap, he further asked Huang Yaoming to "invest" in his business, and let Huang protect his illegal smuggling of cigarettes and tax evasion. When Comrade Xu Jinzhong of the Industrial and Commercial Section noticed this, Li said to Huang, "What should I do? Should I roll them at night?" Huang said, "Roll them! It doesn't matter! If I don't say anything, who will know? Even if they know, it doesn't matter. The county magistrate is not at home, I can be in charge!" Huang returned to the government and criticized Xu Jinzhong, saying, "You can't be too mechanical. What do you know? Bring me your official documents and let me see." The unscrupulous merchant Li Jianguo, like a starved bedbug, often complained to Huang about financial difficulties, and Huang borrowed 2 million yuan of social relief grain funds from the Civil Affairs Section for him. Li Jianguo owed the Financial Grain Section 4,000 jin of millet, and when the Financial Grain Section asked him for it, he went to Huang. Huang supported him, saying, "It doesn't matter if you don't have it." This "secretary" had become a loyal pawn of the unscrupulous merchant. Liu Zengrong, the head of the Industrial and Commercial Section, was also corrupted by the unscrupulous merchant Li Jianguo. Li Jianguo first sent him gifts, and then gave him things like combs, teacups, and small wallets. Then he boasted, "If you let me run the power plant, Shuiye will be electrified soon, I guarantee it." Our "honest" "section chief" believed in this despicable lie that the bourgeoisie habitually uses to defraud state property, and praised Li Jianguo for being active and capable. So he gave Li more than 200 million yuan to buy electric rollers in Shanghai. After Li got the money, he happily said to another unscrupulous merchant, "No matter what, as long as the electric rollers I buy can light up for three days, my account will be reimbursed!" This time, Li defrauded him of 20 million yuan, and the lights still haven't come on after more than a year. But even so, Liu Zengrong praised Li as truly "capable and resourceful," and established him as the "flag" of the industrial and commercial circles in Shuiye Town (at that time, the CPC Anyang County Committee's views were not clear, and it was also responsible for this matter). Later, Li was also elected as the deputy director of the Shuiye Town Federation of Industry and Commerce and a member of the Standing Committee of the Anyang County People's Representative Conference. Soon after, because Li Jianguo cruelly exploited the workers and the workers' lives were really difficult to maintain, they demanded a wage increase. Li simply did not accept this reasonable demand of the workers, but instead beat the workers. The workers complained to the Industrial and Commercial Section, but Liu Zengrong did not support the workers, but unreasonably blamed the workers for "disrupting production." It is clear that he betrayed the working class. The Financial Grain Section and the Grain Bureau used to have two very famous "assistants" when receiving, issuing, and milling grain. One was Xie Yongchun and the other was Yang Shuang, who were two unscrupulous merchants who left no stone unturned. Since they obtained the position of "assistant," they boldly stole grain. In just over a year, these two blood-sucking parasites became fat. Xie Yongchun has become a "nouveau riche" with two rubber-wheeled carts and four or five mules and horses. Sang Wanheng, a doctor in the Western medicine pharmacy of the County People's Government Health Section, was also "sent in." He was ostensibly a doctor in the public Western medicine pharmacy, but in reality, he stole the public medicines back to his own pharmacy.

    The bourgeoisie's encroachment on public security, judicial organs, and party affairs departments was also serious. A private merchant surnamed Bo (who was a counter-revolutionary) won over four cadres from the Public Security Bureau to "become sworn brothers." Among the thirty-odd cadres in the CPC Anyang County Committee, fifteen had been "shareholders" of private merchants. Ma Changtai, a member of the County Committee, also lent money at usurious rates. The Youth League Committee also took the League dues and invested them in private merchants' shares.

    The above facts fully prove that the bourgeoisie has been and is launching a rampant attack on us. They are doing their best to spread decadent ideological influences in all aspects, and are adopting various new methods and forms to compete with the working class for leadership in politics and economics in order to steal state assets. However, it is worth noting that even today, some unscrupulous merchants insist that "the bourgeoisie has not launched an attack on the working class and the Communist Party! There is even less talk of competing with the working class for leadership!" We would like to ask, who are Wang Jiazhi of the Tax Bureau and Wang Wanhe and Wang Youzhi of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, who originally belonged to the working class and served the people, serving now? Who used despicable and shameful methods such as inviting guests, giving gifts, sharing dividends, and "beauties" to lure them? The facts eloquently tell us that it was the illegal merchants who were giving the bribes, and Wang Jiazhi and others, who were originally revolutionary fighters, have been captured by the bourgeoisie and turned into "bunkers" and "informers" placed in state organs. When Wang Jiazhi and others accepted the tasks of the bourgeoisie, they were no longer staff and managers of state organs, but agents of illegal capitalists in the guise of state staff. In their jobs, they were not wholeheartedly serving the people and our great motherland, but serving the despicable and dirty illegal capitalists. The state organs or units they occupied were no longer led by the Communist Party and the working class in essence, but the leadership was usurped by the illegal capitalists. Can this still be said that the bourgeoisie is not attacking us?

    The vast number of revolutionary cadres are rising up to fight back with confidence
    Suppress the offensive of the bourgeoisie
    This rampant and despicable attack by the bourgeoisie can only corrupt the small number of cadres with weak wills mentioned above. The vast number of upright Communist Party members, the vast number of excellent Communist Youth League members, and the vast number of loyal revolutionary workers in Anyang County expressed extraordinary anger at the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants. For example, last summer, under everyone's exposure and firm demands, the government sentenced a staff member of the business section of the Anyang County Branch of the People's Bank, who colluded with illegal capitalists, to imprisonment. Especially after launching this great battle to counterattack the bourgeoisie, everyone quickly and closely united around the Communist Party and the People's Government, with infinite anger, and launched a fierce counterattack against the bourgeoisie in a high-profile and vigorous manner, resolutely suppressing the offensive of the bourgeoisie and giving the bourgeoisie's reactionary and ugly thoughts and behaviors political transformation and legal sanctions. Our proletarian and Communist Party ranks are a hundred times more united and rich in combat experience. When the County Committee overcomes rightist thinking and once it wakes up and fights, the self-serving, opportunistic, and despicable illegal capitalists will have to retreat step by step. In just seven or eight days, Anyang County has arrested twenty-five major embezzlers, removed dozens of "bunkers" and some traitors and economic spies placed by illegal capitalists inside the revolutionary camp. Under the exposure and struggle of the masses, those who have serious circumstances and refuse to confess were arrested and punished according to law. At the same time, the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence in the industrial and commercial sectors has also achieved considerable success. On February 1 alone, six illegal capitalists were exposed and revealed to have evaded taxes of more than 100 million each, and Li Jianguo and other three criminals who had been particularly rampant in attacking the People's Government in the past and refused to confess and cunningly denied their crimes have been arrested and punished according to law.

    With the development of the movement, the leading cadres of Anyang County have gradually overcome rightist thinking and effectively promoted the development of the movement. When the movement first started in December last year, everyone had serious rightist thinking and held a perfunctory attitude of "do it if you are told to do it." Therefore, they could not see "tigers" and believed that "there is only waste and no embezzlement." After some materials on embezzlement and bribery were gradually exposed, the leadership's thinking changed slightly, and they initially understood the significance of Comrade Bo Yibo's statement that the bourgeoisie had launched a rampant attack on us in the past three years. However, when the People's Daily editorial proposed that there must be a large number of major embezzlers in places that manage a lot of money, they still felt, "Maybe this is the case in Beijing!" This shows that they were still sleeping in front of "big tigers," and still had no idea what was going on. After catching six "big tigers," a blind sense of complacency arose, and they always felt that there would not be many more "big tigers" even if there were any. When they made a plan to fight and catch "big tigers," they only planned to catch five. The prefectural committee criticized them for insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the embezzlement problem. Later, after analyzing Anyang County's political foundation and economic situation, everyone woke up and realized that some merchants had drilled into Anyang County, and some had been pulled out. In addition, the leadership had provided very poor class education for cadres in the past few years, and many cadres had been corrupted. The main characteristics of the economy were: the purchase and lending of large amounts of cotton and grain funds; water conservancy and coal mines also handled large amounts of money. After this analysis, it was finally clearly proposed that there are four kinds of "tigers" in Anyang County, one is the "white tiger" (purchasing cotton), one is the "black tiger" (coal mine), one is the "water tiger" (water conservancy), and one is the "money tiger" (financial aspects). After this analysis, the eyes of the county committee leadership group lit up, they had a clear idea, controlled the overall situation, and gained the strategic initiative. Their determination and confidence increased greatly. They unanimously believed that it was not a matter of whether there were "big tigers," but a matter of how to thoroughly eliminate "big tigers," and the rightist sentiment of fearing that "cadres will be ruined" was also eliminated. Now they are engaged in a courageous battle, and have the confidence to suppress the offensive of the bourgeoisie. The County Committee is directing the entire army to fight against "big tigers" and all the rampant offensives of the bourgeoisie with a fighting posture and clear mind. The tense battle and the victory's encouragement make them feel happy. They said: We guarantee to Chairman Mao, to the Party, and to the working people of the whole country that in this battle, we will not stop until we have won a complete victory!

    中共安阳县委坚决克服右倾思想
    对资产阶级的进攻展开猛烈反击
    编者按：有些中、小城市的领导干部认为，“大老虎”可能都出在大城市，中、小城市里藏不住“大老虎”，或者很少“大老虎”。安阳县这个材料用无可置疑的事实驳斥了这种右倾思想。中共安阳县委最初只计划捉到五个大贪污分子；捉到六个以后，一度认为“差不多了”。经上级批评后，他们扭转了这种右倾情绪，捉住了二十五个大贪污分子，并且在工商界中捉到一批大盗窃犯。他们还在认真地研究敌情，继续战斗。但在其他地区，有些中小城市，甚至某些大城市的某些单位，也还有这种右倾情绪存在。这种右倾情绪表现在：对敌情估计不足，只是空谈，而没有进入战斗，或勉强作战而没有狠心、信心和决心，或者得到小胜就想收兵。凡是有这种右倾情绪的干部，都应该照着安阳的样子，立即纠正。
    安阳县城（水冶）有三百多户工商业，是一个比较繁荣的小市镇。二、三年来，许多不法资本家对安阳县共产党的组织和人民政府进行了猖狂的进攻。
    资产阶级主要进攻目标是
    国家经济部门
    他们进攻的主要目标，是税务局、银行、供销合作社等经济部门。他们为了偷税、窃取国家资财，不惜采取了各种最下流的卑劣无耻的手段。如奸商李建国，到机关里去时，常装着糖和花生，见人就送；有时干部到饭馆吃饭，便时常会忽然有人送来一碗肉，说是某某经理或某某老板“敬”的。有些奸商见到银行、税务局的干部从门口过，抓住就往柜台里边拉，请喝茶，请吃饭。银行盖起一座办公室，便有二十多家私商慌忙放炮送匾“祝贺”。这就是他们勾引干部的第一步。接着便是进一步的拉拢和行贿。奸商李建国为了向干部行贿，专门去上海买了一箱子东西，仅雨衣就有五十四件，其他如钢笔手表及其他各种日用品很多，还有香皂和梳子，以及准备给家属小孩用的小鼓、小喇叭等。资产阶级的这些“糖衣炮弹”就是这样无孔不入地向我们发射，并且打中了不少革命队伍中的意志薄弱者。如税务局长王迅，便上了李建国的钩。李建国接着便进一步的拉拢他。让王迅的一个妹妹和一个小孩子到他家里住，并管他们饭吃。李又教自己的孩子喊王迅为“王大爷”。奸商李建国以这些可耻下流的办法俘掳了王迅以后，便大量逃税，仅一九五一年他就拖欠税款七千多万元，至今未还。王迅明知道，也不去催讨了。资产阶级拉拢干部的再一种办法是吸收为“股东”，进而“拉过去”，使这些人变成为隐藏在我们内部的听他指挥的经济奸细。税务局王家智便是被资产阶级这种毒辣手段所毁灭而变成可耻的叛徒。现在查出的，已有六家奸商拉他做了股东，而后奸商们又以威胁的办法，使王时常向他们泄露经济情报，仅一次泄露税花要提价的经济秘密，便使国家损失数千万元。王家智总共贪污受贿一千二百万元，奸商们漏税即达十亿元。整个水冶镇不法资本家仅一九五一年便漏税九十亿元。用这些钱，可买六架战斗机，相当于安阳县全年农业税的三分之一。这是何等巨大的损失啊！供销社推销经理部副经理王万和，被三家奸商以“美人计”拉为“股东”。并通过王万和盗窃公款盗窃经济情报。盐要涨价，王万和便通知奸商买盐，布要涨价便通知奸商买布。供应经理部经理王友智被资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”打垮后，私自将公款三千万元、小米一万三千二百斤给私商贩卖毒品，商人并时常让他吸“老海”（毒品）。王友智就这样滑进了资产阶级腐化堕落的泥坑。
    供销社贪污最严重的单位是花行。其中，贪污者绝大部分是原来本地的私商和经纪人，是在我们去年收购棉花时，用人不问政治条件，单纯技术观点的情况下“钻进来”或“派进来”的。他们贪污成性。反贪污斗争中，大家都在外边开会斗争“大老虎”时，还有两个贪污分子趁火打劫，躲在家里偷棉花。这些“钻进来”的私商和本地私商有广泛的联系。在收购棉花时，很多“花贩子”就是他们的“自己一伙”，勾结起来共同捣鬼。花行会计王成书是被他父亲（奸商）王存仁派来的经济奸细，到花行后就盗取经济情报，盗骗公款，来贩卖棉花，投机取巧，垄断市场。结果，不到二年他就成了“大富翁”。
    奸商们对政府部门的进攻
    也没有放松
    资产阶级对政府部门腐蚀的重点，是掌管经济的单位和部分意志薄弱的领导人。如县人民政府秘书黄耀明，为奸商李建国所腐蚀，使国家资财受到很大损失。李建国开始给黄耀明送礼，进行诱惑，以和公家搞生意的名义，两次骗取人民币八百万元。以后李建国说生产赔钱，不但没给红利，而且连本也拖延不给。以后又收买黄耀明的母亲，给黄耀明送表、买钢笔，给黄的小孩子买东西，又认了干亲，又让黄的老婆、母亲到他家里去住，一步一步地向黄耀明进攻。当李建国认为黄耀明已经上了圈套之后，就进一步叫黄耀明在他的生意中“入股”。并让黄庇护他非法偷卷烟，走私漏税。当被工商科科员许金钟同志察觉后，李对黄说：“怎样办？我黑夜卷吧？”黄说：“卷吧！没关系！我不说谁知道，知道了也不要紧。县长不在家，我就能当家！”黄回到政府竟批评许金钟说：“你不能太机械，你知道啥？把你那公文搬来我看看。”奸商李建国像一只饿瘪的大臭虫，时常向黄诉说资金困难，黄便到民政科给他借社会救济粮款二百万元。李建国欠财粮科四千斤小米，财粮科问他要时，他便找黄。黄给他撑腰说：“没有也不要紧。”这位“秘书”已成了奸商忠实的走卒了。工商科长刘增荣也受到奸商李建国的腐蚀。李建国先给他送礼，又送了梳子、茶杯和小皮夹等东西。接着便吹嘘说：“要让我搞电厂，保险很快水冶就电气化。”资产阶级为了坑骗国家财产所惯用的这种卑劣的谎话，我们的这位“诚实”的“科长”就信以为真了，夸李建国积极能干。于是便给李二亿多元去上海买电磙子。李拿到钱后高兴地对另一个奸商说：“管他三七二十一，只要买的电磙子能亮三天，我的账就报了！”这一次就被李骗了二千万元，而电灯一年多了仍没有亮。可是就这样，刘增荣还称赞李真是“有能力，有办法”，把他树立为水冶镇工商界的“旗帜”
    （当时中共安阳县委观点也不明确，对这件事也有责任）。后来李又被选为水冶镇工商业联合会的副主任、县各界人民代表会议常务委员会的委员。不久，因为李建国对工人残酷剥削，工人的生活实在难以维持，要求增资。李根本不接受工人的这种合理要求，反而把工人打了一顿，工人告到工商科，刘增荣也不给工人撑腰作主，反而无理地责备工人“破坏生产”。很明显地他出卖了工人阶级。财粮科、粮食局，过去在收发粮食碾米时有两个很出名的“助手”。一为谢永春，一为杨双，是两个无孔不钻的奸商。自他俩取得了“助手”的位置后，便大胆地偷粮食。才一年多的时间，这两个喝血的毒虫就吃肥了。谢永春已成了两辆胶轮马车、四五匹骡马的“暴发户”。县人民政府卫生科西药房医生桑万恒，也是“派进来”的，他表面是公家西药房的医生，实际上把公家的药品盗回自己的药房里去了。
    资产阶级对公安、司法机关和党务部门的侵蚀也是严重的。一个姓薄的私商（是反革命分子）即拉拢公安局四个干部“拜仁兄弟”。中共安阳县委机关三十多个干部中，就有十五人曾做私商的“股东”。县委委员马常太还放高利贷。青委把团费也拿去入了私商的股。
    以上的事实，充分证明资产阶级曾经而且正在向我们进行猖狂的进攻。他们在各方面尽量散布腐朽的思想影响，并采取各种新的方法和形式，在政治上和经济上和工人阶级争夺领导权，以便盗窃国家资财。但是，值得注意的，到今天，还有些奸商们硬说：“资产阶级并没有向工人阶级和共产党发动进攻呀！更谈不到和工人阶级争夺领导权！”我们要请问一句，原来属于工人阶级队伍中为人民服务的税务局的王家智，供销社的王万和、王友智等人，他们现在变成为谁服务了呢？是谁用请客、送礼、入股分红、“美人”等卑鄙可耻的方法勾引了他们呢？事实雄辩地告诉我们，行贿的正是那些不法的奸商，原属革命战士的王家智等已被资产阶级俘获，变成安置在国家机关的“暗堡”和“坐探”。当王家智等接受资产阶级的任务时，他们已不是国家机关的工作人员和经理，而是穿着国家工作人员的外衣的不法资本家的代理人。他们在工作岗位上，不是忠心耿耿为人民服务，为我们伟大的祖国服务，而是为卑鄙龌龊的不法的资本家服务。他们所霸占的国家机关或单位，实质上已经不是由共产党、工人阶级来实行领导，而是被不法的资本家篡夺了领导。这还能说不是资产阶级向我们进攻吗？
    广大革命干部奋起反击有信心
    把资产阶级的进攻压下去
    资产阶级这种猖狂和卑鄙的进攻，只能腐蚀了上边所说那些少数意志薄弱的干部。安阳县广大正直的共产党员、广大优秀的青年团员和广大忠诚的革命工作者，对奸商这种罪行，却表示异常愤怒的。如去年夏季在大家的检举和坚决要求下，政府即把与不法的资本家勾结的人民银行安阳县支行业务股一个股员判处徒刑。尤其这次发起了向资产阶级反攻的伟大战斗之后，大家便迅速地紧紧团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，怀着无限的愤怒，大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地向资产阶级展开了猛烈的反攻，坚决把资产阶级的进攻压下去，并把资产阶级的这种反动的丑恶的思想和行为给以政治上的改造和法律上的制裁。我们无产阶级和共产党的队伍，是百倍团结而又富有战斗经验的。当县委克服了右倾思想，一旦清醒起来，战斗起来的时候，唯利是图、投机取巧的卑污的不法资本家就只好节节退败了。在短短的七、八天时间里，安阳县已捉住了二十五个大贪污分子，拔掉了数十个不法资本家在革命阵营内部安置的“堡垒”和一部分叛徒和经济奸细。在群众的检举和斗争之下，并把其中情节严重而又拒不坦白的分子逮捕法办。和这同时，在工商界开展的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，也已获得了相当的胜利。仅二月一日一天，便检举和揭发出六家不法的资本家漏税均在一亿以上，并已把过去向人民政府进攻特别猖狂而又拒不坦白狡猾抵赖的李建国等三名罪犯逮捕法办。
    安阳县的领导干部随着运动的发展，逐步克服着右倾思想，有力地推动了运动开展。去年十二月运动刚开始时，大家都有严重的右倾思想，抱着“叫搞就搞?”的应付态度。因此看不见“老虎”，认为“只有浪费没有贪污”。逐渐暴露了一些贪污受贿的材料之后，领导思想转了一下，初步体会到薄一波同志所说的三年以来资产阶级向我们猖狂进攻的意义。但当人民日报社论中提出凡是经管大量钱财的地方必定有大批大贪污分子时，仍感觉
    “大概在北京是这样吧！”这说明这时他们还在
    “大老虎”面前睡大觉，仍然心中没数。在捉到了六个“大老虎”后，又产生了盲目自满情绪，总感觉“大老虎”即使再有也不会有几个了。他们订战斗的捉“大老虎”的计划时，只打算捉五个。地委批评他们对贪污问题的严重性认识不足。后来经过分析安阳县政治基础和经济情况，大家清醒过来了，认识到安阳县商人钻进来了一些，也拉出去了一些，再加上领导方面几年来对干部进行阶级教育很差，不少干部被腐蚀了。在经济上的主要特点是：收购和贷放大量的棉花和粮款；水利和煤矿也都经手大量的钱财。经这样一分析，最后明确提出安阳县有四种“虎”，一种是“白虎”（收购棉花），一种“黑虎”（煤矿），一种“水虎”（水利），一种“钱虎”（财经方面），经这样一分析，县委领导集团的眼睛亮了，心里有数了，控制了全局，争取了战略上的主动，决心和信心倍增。一致认为决不是没有“大老虎”的问题，而是如何彻底肃清“大老虎”的问题，怕“整垮了干部”的右倾情绪也随之消除。现在他们正在进行勇敢的战斗，有信心把资产阶级的进攻压下去。县委正以战斗的姿态，清醒地指挥着全军向“大老虎”、向资产阶级一切猖狂的进攻搏斗。紧张的战斗，胜利的鼓舞，使他们感到愉快。他们表示：我们向毛主席、向党、向全国的劳动人民保证，在这场战斗中，不彻底获得全胜誓不休止！
