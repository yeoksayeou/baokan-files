　　(I) The U.S. Opposition to the Soviet Union as a Neutral Nation is Completely Unjustified

　　During the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks, our side proposed the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia as the three neutral nations invited by our side to form the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the U.S. side, without any reason, opposed our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation. This unreasonable attitude of the U.S. side is completely intolerable.

　　According to the definition of a neutral nation in Article 38 of the draft agreement proposed by the U.S. side itself, a neutral nation is defined as "a country whose combat troops have not participated in hostile acts in Korea." There is absolutely no doubt that the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, nominated by our side, fully meet the qualifications of a neutral nation as stipulated by this definition. Not only did these three countries not have a single soldier in Korea, but they also did not send medical units and ships or other assistance for the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, like Norway and Sweden, the neutral nations nominated by the U.S. side. But the U.S. side only accepted Poland and Czechoslovakia, nominated by our side, and opposed our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation. What reason is there for this? Is it possible that Norway, which unconditionally supported the illegal U.S. resolution to invade Korea in the United Nations Security Council, and Sweden, which was praised by U.S. President Truman for sending medical units to assist the U.S. in its war of aggression against Korea, can be nominated as neutral nations by the U.S. side, while the Soviet Union, which has consistently made unremitting efforts to oppose interference in the Korean War and advocate the restoration of peace in Korea, cannot be nominated as a neutral nation by our side? What kind of logic is this? Obviously, the U.S. opposition is completely unreasonable and cannot offer any justification.

　　Everyone knows that the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, especially the Soviet Union, have consistently worked for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward fair proposals in the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, advocating a ceasefire between the warring parties in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea in order to resolve the Korean issue by peaceful means. Moreover, people also know that the Korean armistice talks were initiated due to the proposal of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, on June 23, 1951. At the Sixth United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union also made sincere efforts to break the U.S. side's delaying tactics and assist in the smooth progress of the Korean armistice talks. All these efforts made by the Soviet Union to smoothly complete the Korean negotiations, achieve a ceasefire in Korea, and restore peace in Korea at an early date have been unanimously supported and endorsed by peace-loving people around the world, including the people of the United States and Britain. These ironclad facts irrefutably prove that the Soviet Union is genuinely concerned about peace in Korea and is best able to make the most impartial efforts to achieve peace in Korea. As our representative to the staff meeting on the third agenda item pointed out at the meeting on the 18th, "If the Soviet Union cannot be nominated as a neutral nation, then there is simply no neutral nation in the world."

　　The U.S. side's unreasonable opposition to our nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation is clearly for ulterior motives. Dairou, the U.S. representative to the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks, openly admitted in an interview with the Associated Press on the 16th of this month that he "had been ordered to oppose the Soviet Union's participation in the neutral nations' inspection group before (referring to before our side submitted the list of neutral nations)." It can be seen from this that the U.S. side had already intended to use this issue to once again employ the tactic of delaying negotiations before this issue was even discussed. However, since the U.S. side's unreasonable attitude in opposing the nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation is completely unjustified, their tactic of delaying negotiations appears extremely vile and clumsy, so much so that anyone with a little understanding can see through the U.S. side's purpose at a glance.

　　Our representative to the staff meeting on the third agenda item has severely condemned this shameless means of the U.S. side to continue delaying the armistice talks at the meetings held in recent days, and demanded that the other side immediately withdraw their unreasonable opposition. Moreover, in order to quickly reach a full agreement on the third agenda item, our representative put forward the following fair and reasonable proposal on the issue of nominating neutral nations at the meeting on the 18th: "If it is necessary to implement the procedure of consent, both sides should simultaneously and once agree to the other side's entire nomination of neutral countries. Otherwise, in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of the draft armistice agreement, both sides shall each nominate three neutral countries, without any consent procedures." The facts are very clear that since the neutral nations nominated by our side so irrefutably meet the definition of neutral nations, and the U.S. side is so obviously unreasonably delaying the negotiations, our proposal has become the only reasonable way to resolve the issue of nominating neutral nations. If the U.S. side continues to adhere to its unreasonable attitude and refuses to agree to our proposal, then the U.S. side will absolutely not be able to escape its responsibility for continuing to delay the Korean armistice talks in front of peace-loving people all over the world.

### （一）美方反对苏联为中立国是毫无理由的

    （一）美方反对苏联为中立国是毫无理由的
    在朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方提出了苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克为我方所邀请的组成中立国监察委员会的三个中立国家。但是美方竟毫无理由地反对我方所提名的苏联为中立国。美方的这种无理态度，是完全令人不能容忍的。
    就照美方自己所提出的协定草案第三十八款的规定，所谓中立国家的定义是“其战斗部队未曾参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”。我方所提名的苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克，完全符合于这个定义所规定的中立国的资格是决无疑义的。这三个国家在朝鲜不但没有一兵一卒，而且也没有像美方所提名的中立国家挪威和瑞典那样，为美国的侵朝战争派遣了医疗单位和船只之类的援助。但是美方却只接受了我方所提名的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，而反对我方所提名的苏联为中立国，这有什么理由可说呢？难道说，在联合国安全理事会中曾经无条件支持美国侵略朝鲜的非法决议的挪威，和由于派遣了医疗单位协助美国进行侵朝战争而受到美国总统杜鲁门的赞扬的瑞典，可以由美方提名为中立国，而一贯为反对干涉朝鲜战争、主张恢复朝鲜和平进行了不懈的努力的苏联，反不能由我方提名为中立国，这是什么逻辑呢？显然的，美方的反对是完全没有理由，而且也提不出任何理由的。
    谁都知道，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克，这三个国家，尤其是苏联，曾一贯地为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力。苏联在朝鲜战争爆发以来，在联合国安全理事会和联合国大会中，屡次提出公正建议，主张朝鲜交战双方停火，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，以便以和平方法解决朝鲜问题。而且，人们也都知道，朝鲜停战谈判的举行也是由于苏联驻联合国代表马立克一九五一年六月二十三日的提议而促成的。在第六届联合国大会中，苏联又曾为打破美方的拖延战术，协助朝鲜停战谈判的顺利进行，作了真诚的努力。苏联为顺利完成朝鲜谈判、实现朝鲜停火、早日恢复朝鲜和平所作的这一切努力，曾受到世界爱好和平人民包括美英人民的一致支持和拥护。这些铁的事实，无可辩驳地证明了，苏联是真正关心朝鲜的和平，并且也最能为实现朝鲜的和平而作最公正的努力的。正如我方出席第三项议程参谋会议的代表在十八日的会议上所指出的：“如果苏联都不能作为中立国提名，世界上就根本没有任何中立国的存在”了。
    美方所以无理反对我方提名苏联为中立国，显然是别有用心的。美方出席朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议的代表戴罗，在本月十六日对美联社记者发表的谈话中即曾公开供认：他“前（指我方提出中立国名单以前）曾奉令反对苏联参加中立国的视察小组”。由此可见，美方在没有讨论到这个问题以前，就已蓄意要在这个问题上再一次施展拖延谈判的手法。但是美方反对提名苏联为中立国的无理态度既然是毫无理由的，因而他们的这种拖延谈判的手法就显得极端恶劣和笨拙，以致使任何稍明事理的人，都可以一眼看出美方的目的何在。
    对于美方继续拖延停战谈判的这种无耻手段，我方出席第三项议程参谋会议的代表在连日举行的会议上已严词加以斥责，并要求对方立即撤回它们的无理反对。并且为了迅速达成第三项议程的全部协议，我方代表在十八日的会议上对中立国提名问题提出了如下的公正合理的建议，这就是：“如果需要实行同意的手续，双方应同时并一次同意对方对于中立国家的全部提名。否则即按照停战协议草案第三十八款的规定，双方各自提名三个中立国，不必进行任何同意手续。”事实很明白，既然我方提名的中立国家是如此无可辩驳地符合于中立国家的定义，而美方又是如此明显无理地拖延谈判，因而我方的这一建议就成为解决中立国提名问题的唯一合理办法了。如果美方继续坚持其无理态度，不肯同意我方的建议，那末，美方在全世界爱好和平人民的面前就绝对无法逃脱其继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判的责任。
