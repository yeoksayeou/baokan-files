Because capitalists such as Zhang Xinwu of the Liuhegou Coal Mine were sabotaging production, stealing assets, and defaulting on wages, production at the Liuhegou Coal Mine was in a state of stagnation. In order to protect the mine and continue to maintain production, the employees of the Liuhegou Coal Mine, under the leadership of the local government, the Party committee, and the trade union, established a temporary management and production committee on January 18, electing eighteen members, with Chang Jizhong as director, and Zhang Juxing and Yang Ruiguo as deputy directors, to lead the employees in production.

In order to solve the current living problems of the workers of the Liuhegou Coal Mine, the Pingyuan Province Unemployed Workers Relief Committee allocated 150 million yuan on January 14, temporarily lending it to the workers to tide them over the Spring Festival. Qiao Han, head of the Labor Protection Section of the Provincial Labor Bureau, and Wang Hong, head of the Labor Insurance Section, went to the Liuhegou Coal Mine to express their condolences to the employees and help them overcome their difficulties.

The Preparatory Committee of the Pingyuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wrote a letter to the workers of the Liuhegou Coal Mine and called on all workers in the province to unite and support their just struggle.

The Pingyuan Provincial Shop Employees' Union, representing all shop employee workers in the province, firmly supports the workers of the Liuhegou Coal Mine and supports the government in arresting and bringing to justice unscrupulous capitalists such as Zhang Xinwu.

Employees of the privately-owned Chengxing Yarn Factory in Xinxiang City enthusiastically launched discussions, expressing their heartfelt sympathy for the suffering of the worker brothers at the Liuhegou Coal Mine. Many workers donated money and wrote letters of condolence to help the workers of the Liuhegou Coal Mine. Many workers said: "Workers all over the world are one family. The suffering of the worker brothers at the Liuhegou Coal Mine is our suffering. We must help them." Through this discussion, they further recognized the nature of the bourgeoisie.
