Luo Kexian, an eighteen-year-old young nursing worker, has been fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers on the front lines in Korea. The wounded and sick comrades all warmly call her "our own sister."

Luo Kexian clearly remembers the scene when she first accepted the task: One night, eighty wounded soldiers were transported from the front and lay in a mountain cave, many of them urgently needing to relieve themselves, but there wasn't even an oil lamp in the cave. At this time, Luo Kexian took advantage of the moonlight to find a steel helmet discarded by an American devil on the hillside. She lit wild grass to provide light and used the steel helmet as a chamber pot for the wounded soldiers, carrying and delivering it back and forth, taking care of the wounded until dawn. Early the next morning, without resting, she ran out again and collected many tin cans from the field, making large ones into basins and small ones into bowls, some with a wooden handle attached to make a spoon, and also made spittoons and washbasins for the sick and wounded, so that everything was available.

Winter came, and the earthen beds in the cave were icy cold. In order to reduce the suffering of the wounded soldiers, during the day, Luo Kexian often braved the danger of enemy planes bombing and strafing to go to the mountains to collect firewood. At night, enduring fatigue and cold, she burned the beds for the wounded and washed their feet with warm water. Sometimes she had to cross mountains and ridges to carry the wounded dozens of miles away. When the sick and wounded had lice on their bodies, Luo Kexian personally took off their shirts for them and scalded them one by one with hot water. After scalding, she went to the small river to wash them. The river water was icy cold, but when she thought of the soldiers charging into battle, she endured all the pain. Often, when she finished washing the clothes one by one, the east was already red, and a thin layer of white frost hung on her hair.

Luo Kexian never fears any danger for the safety of the wounded and sick. One day, a ward caught fire after being bombed, and smoke and fire blocked the door, while enemy planes circled and strafed at low altitude. At this time, Luo Kexian rushed forward, rolling and crawling, immediately took off her cotton coat, covered her head, and rushed into the ward, rescuing eleven wounded soldiers from the thick smoke and fire; then she carried them one by one to a safe place, changed their dressings, and bandaged their wounds. The wounded soldiers held Comrade Luo Kexian's hand and said with tears, "When our injuries are healed, we will definitely return to the front line and kill more enemies to repay you and the people of the motherland for your care."

### 热爱伤员的罗克贤

    热爱伤员的罗克贤
    十八岁的青年护理工作者罗克贤，随同人民志愿军一直转战在朝鲜的前线，伤病员同志们都热情地称呼她是“我们的亲生姊妹”。
    罗克贤清楚地记得她第一次接受任务时的情景：一天夜里，从前方运送下来八十名伤员，躺满了一个山洞，许多人急着要大小便，但是这个山洞里却连只油灯也没有。罗克贤这时便趁着月光，跑到山坡上找来了一个美国鬼子丢下的钢盔。她点燃起野草来取亮，用钢盔给伤员们做便盆，一趟一趟的端送，一直招扶伤员们到天亮。第二天一早，她没有休息，便又跑出去从野外拾来了许多罐头盒子，把大的做盆，小的做碗，有的钉上一个木把做成勺子，还给伤病员做了痰盂和脸盆，使一切器具都有了。
    冬天到了，窑洞里的土炕冷冰冰的。罗克贤为了减少伤员们的痛苦，在白天，她经常冒着敌机轰炸扫射的危险，到山上去打柴。夜里忍受着疲劳和寒冷，为伤员们烧炕、温水洗脚。有时候还要翻山越岭，到几十里地以外去背伤员。伤病员身上生了虱子，罗克贤亲自替他们把衬衣换下来，一件一件地用热水去烫。烫过之后，再到小河里去洗。河水冰凉刺骨，但她一想起战士们冲锋陷阵的情景，她就忍着一切痛苦。经常当她把衣裳一件一件洗完后，东方已经发红，她的头发上挂了一层薄薄的白霜。
    罗克贤为了伤病员的安全，从不恐惧任何危险。有一天，一座病房被炸起火了，烟和火已封住了门口，敌机在低空盘旋扫射。这时，罗克贤连滚带爬地赶上前去，立即脱下棉袄，把头一蒙冲进病房里，从浓烟烈火中抢救出十一个伤员；然后又把他们一个一个地背到安全的地方，替他们换药和包扎伤口。伤员们握着罗克贤同志的手流着泪说：“我们的伤好了，一定重返前线，杀伤更多的敌人，来回答你和祖国人民对我们的关怀。”（附图片）
