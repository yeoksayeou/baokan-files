The "Burmese People's Daily" reported that there were 1,300 well-equipped Kuomintang bandit troops near Dakou, north of Mong Pan in the Burmese Shan State. The Kuomintang bandit troops attacked villages, carried out acts of terror against residents, and seized farmers' grain and livestock. In some areas, the Kuomintang bandit troops even forced farmers to pay "head taxes," bankrupting many farm households.

The newspaper also reported that the Kuomintang bandit troops were wearing American khaki uniforms and old American steel helmets.

The "Federal Gazette" published a telegram from its reporter in the border city of Tachileik, stating that the Kuomintang bandit troops had an airport in the border area, and planes were landing at the airport. In Kengtung, 1,500 Kuomintang bandit troops were building roads.

Recently, in addition to constantly robbing farmers of pigs and cattle, they demanded that the authorities in the Mong Ping area pay 6,000 tons of rice. They forced farmers to perform heavy construction labor.

The newspaper concluded that residents were constantly resisting the Kuomintang bandit troops.
