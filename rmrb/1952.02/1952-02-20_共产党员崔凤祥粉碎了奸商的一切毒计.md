Communist Party member Cui Fengxiang smashed the insidious schemes of the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying, who attempted to bribe and frame him, demonstrating the qualities that a Communist Party member should possess.

Cui Fengxiang was born into a middle-peasant family. He had worked as a long-term laborer for landlords and as a shop assistant, so he had a strong class hatred for landlords and unscrupulous merchants. He joined the revolutionary work in 1938 and gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1945. After that, he tempered himself in the struggle against local bullies and the like. In 1948, he was transferred to the North China Party School to study. During his studies, he often listened to reports from responsible comrades, which gave him a certain understanding of the selfish, speculative, opportunistic, and profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie. From then on, Cui Fengxiang's vigilance against the bourgeoisie greatly increased.

After Tianjin was liberated in 1949, Cui Fengxiang accepted the Party's task of going to the private Zhenzhong Rubber Factory to help workers organize a trade union. Soon after arriving at the factory, Cui Fengxiang saw through the ugly face of Zhou Weiying, the manager of Zhenzhong Rubber Factory. Zhou Weiying and others usually treated the workers very badly and were arrogant. They sowed discord, creating contradictions between staff and workers, as well as between long-term and short-term workers, and used two foremen to rule the workers. Cui Fengxiang, of course, could not tolerate these unreasonable phenomena. Therefore, he actively conducted class education for the workers, organized a staff preparatory committee, mobilized the workers to abolish the illegal exploitation of the contractors, and strove for relatively reasonable wages and benefits. Because Cui Fengxiang was able to serve the people loyally and diligently, he established the prestige of the Party and the trade union among the staff and workers, and the entire factory staff and workers were closely united around him.

This situation was, of course, unfavorable to the unscrupulous merchant. The unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying was worried that his illegal activities would be seen through and exposed by the staff and workers, so he attempted to buy off Cui Fengxiang with bribery and other vile means.

One day, the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying took a Parker 51 fountain pen and said to Cui Fengxiang with a treacherous smile, "This fountain pen is the best American product, let's trade them." As he spoke, he snatched Cui Fengxiang's fountain pen and shamelessly refused to return it. Cui Fengxiang said to him very seriously, "This pen was given to me by an old comrade-in-arms and cannot be given to you casually." When the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying saw that the situation was not right, he pretended to be about to smash the pen on the ground and said, "What a good pen, I'll kick it to pieces for you!" Cui Fengxiang ignored him, took back his pen, and walked away.

After this, Cui Fengxiang's vigilance against the unscrupulous merchant increased even more. He remembered that when he was studying at the Party School before entering the city, Comrade Dong Biwu and Comrade Bo Yibo both said in their reports: We must be vigilant at all times against the attacks of bourgeois ideology. Communist Party members should transform the colorful old cities, but they cannot be conquered by the colorful old cities themselves. Thinking of this, he immediately reported the capitalist's despicable act of bribery to the director of the First District Office of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions.

Once, Cui Fengxiang went upstairs, and just as he reached the corner of the stairs, factory director Chen Fengming (the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying's cousin) suddenly stuffed a pen into his pocket and whispered, "Take it quickly, no one will know." Cui Fengxiang took out the pen and sternly rebuked him, saying, "This style of yours is very bad, don't do this again!"

Although the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying ran into snags several times, he did not give up his evil intentions. He thought, "You will always like something." Seeing that Cui Fengxiang's shirt was torn, he took many new shirts and said to Cui Fengxiang, "These are my old clothes, take a few to wear." Later, he took several pairs of socks and said, "It's okay if you wear two pairs of socks, right?" In addition, he often invited Cui Fengxiang to take a bath, watch a play, and eat at a restaurant, all of which were rejected by Cui Fengxiang.

The unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying already understood that it was impossible to drag Cui Fengxiang down with material inducements, so he wanted to change his attack method—to lure Cui Fengxiang by "praising" him. Once, the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying stole the name of all the factory's staff and workers and made a beautiful brocade banner embroidered with the words "Comrade Cui Fengxiang Commemorative" in an attempt to paralyze Cui Fengxiang with this banner. However, this banner hung in Zhou Weiying's own room for more than three months, and he never dared to use it to tempt Cui Fengxiang. Later, the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying felt bored and quietly put it away again.

The unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying's bribery and "praise" tricks went bankrupt, and he wanted to undermine Cui Fengxiang's prestige among the staff and workers. He often deliberately showed great affection for Cui Fengxiang in front of the staff and workers, attempting to blur the workers' understanding, and said to Cui Fengxiang, "I'll give you money, you can do some agency (First District Trade Union Office) production." He felt that this would create the illusion among the staff and workers that Cui Fengxiang was cozying up to the unscrupulous merchant and greedy for the small benefits of the unscrupulous merchant; however, the workers' eyes were sharp, and despite the unscrupulous merchant's tricks, the entire factory's staff and workers were still closely united around Cui Fengxiang.

Seeing that material inducements and sowing discord were unsuccessful, the unscrupulous merchant turned his face and quarreled with Cui Fengxiang, saying that Lao Cui "can't manage 'Zhenzhong's' affairs" and wanted to squeeze him out of the factory. This trick also failed, so he became so vicious that he wanted to harm Cui Fengxiang. He fabricated rumors that Cui Fengxiang had an improper relationship with a female worker in the factory, attempting to frame Cui Fengxiang. But this conspiracy also failed shamefully.

The unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying used all kinds of insidious and vicious means and had corrupted some cadres, allowing him to steal a large amount of state property; however, these means were completely ineffective against Communist Party member Cui Fengxiang. Cui Fengxiang stood unswervingly on the position of the working class and shattered all the conspiracies of the unscrupulous merchant.

On the eve of the Spring Festival, the unscrupulous merchant Zhou Weiying was arrested by the People's Court, and the honest and selfless Communist Party member Cui Fengxiang accused Zhou Weiying of the crime of corrupting cadres. He said, "The People's Government should severely punish these unscrupulous merchants who harm people."

    共产党员崔凤祥粉碎了奸商的一切毒计
    宝瑞  萧扬
    共产党员崔凤祥粉碎了奸商周维英利诱、陷害的阴谋毒计，表现了共产党员应有的品质。
    崔凤祥出身于中农家庭，过去曾经给地主当过长工，也当过店员，因此，他对地主和奸商有着强烈的阶级仇恨。他在一九三八年参加革命工作，一九四五年光荣地参加了中国共产党。此后，他在反恶霸等等的斗争中锻炼了自己。一九四八年，他被调到华北党校学习。学习期间，常听负责同志的报告，对资产阶级损人利己、投机取巧、唯利是图的本性有了一定认识。从此崔凤祥对资产阶级的警惕性大大提高了。
    一九四九年天津解放后，崔凤祥接受党的任务，到私营震中橡胶厂去帮助工人组织工会。崔凤祥到厂不久，就看穿了震中橡胶厂经理周维英的鬼脸。周维英等平常对工人的态度很坏，气焰嚣张；挑拨离间，制造职员工人之间及长工、短工之间的矛盾，又利用了两个工头统治工人。崔凤祥对这些不合理的现象，当然不能容忍。于是他积极对工人进行阶级教育，并组织了职工筹委会，发动工人取消了包工头的非法剥削，争取了比较合理的工资待遇。因为崔凤祥能够忠诚刻苦地为人民服务，在职工间树立了党和工会的威信，全厂职工遂紧密地团结在他的周围。
    这样的情况当然对奸商不利。奸商周维英担心自己的不法行为会被职工识破、揭露，便妄图用行贿等等的恶劣手段收买崔凤祥。
    有一天，奸商周维英拿了一支派克五十一型水笔，满脸奸笑地对崔凤祥说：“这支钢笔是最好的美国货，咱俩换着使吧。”说着，就把崔凤祥的钢笔抢去，撒赖不还。崔凤祥很严肃地对他说：“我这支笔是个老战友送给的，不能随便给你。”奸商周维英一看风头不对，又装着要把钢笔摔在地上的样子说：“什么好钢笔，我给你踹碎喽！”崔凤祥没理他，追回自己的钢笔，就走开了。
    此后，崔凤祥对奸商的警惕性更加提高了。他想起入城以前在党校学习时，董必武同志和薄一波同志的报告中都说：要时时刻刻警惕资产阶级思想的袭击。共产党员要改造花花绿绿的旧城市，却不能被花花绿绿的旧城市把自己征服。他想到这里，马上向天津市总工会一区办事处主任报告了资本家卑鄙的行贿行为。
    有一次，崔凤祥到楼上去，刚走到楼梯拐角的地方，忽然厂长陈凤鸣（奸商周维英的表哥）拿一支钢笔塞进他的口袋，低声说：“赶快收下吧，谁都不会知道的。”崔凤祥把钢笔掏出来，很严厉地斥责他说：“你这种作风很恶劣，以后不许这样！”
    奸商周维英虽然连碰了几次钉子，但是贼心不死，他想：“反正你总会喜欢一样东西。”他看见崔凤祥的衬衣破了，就拿了许多新衬衣对崔凤祥说：“这是我的旧衣裳，你拿几件穿穿吧。”后来又拿了几双袜子来，说：“你穿两双袜子，总不要紧吧？”此外，还经常邀崔凤祥去洗澡、看戏、吃馆子，所有这些，都被崔凤祥拒绝了。
    奸商周维英已经懂得，用物质引诱的方法来拖崔凤祥下水是不可能的了，于是他想换一套进攻的方法——用“捧场”的方法来勾引崔凤祥。有一次奸商周维英盗用全厂职工的名义，做了一面漂亮的锦旗，绣上“崔凤祥同志留念”的字样，打算用这面锦旗来麻痹崔凤祥。但是，这面锦旗在周维英自己的屋子里挂了三个多月，始终不敢拿来诱惑崔凤祥。后来，奸商周维英自觉无趣，又不声不响地把它收起来了。
    奸商周维英贿赂、“捧场”的诡计破产了，又想破坏崔凤祥在职工群众中的威信。他经常当着职工们的面，故意对崔凤祥表示很亲热，企图模糊职工们的认识，并对崔凤祥说：“我给你们钱，你们搞点机关（一区工会办事处）生产吧。”他觉得这样就会在职工群众中造成错觉，以为崔凤祥是靠拢奸商，并贪图奸商的小利的；但是工人的眼睛是雪亮的，尽管奸商使尽花招，全厂职工仍旧紧密地团结在崔凤祥的周围。
    奸商见利诱、离间不成，就翻脸和崔凤祥吵架，说老崔“管不着‘震中’的事”，想把他排挤出厂。这一计也没有成功，就狠毒到想暗害崔凤祥。他造谣崔凤祥和厂子里某女工有不正当的男女关系，企图陷害崔凤祥。但这一阴谋也可耻地失败了。
    奸商周维英用了种种阴险毒辣的手段，曾经腐蚀了一些干部，使他得以大量盗窃国家财产；但是这些手段对于共产党员崔凤祥却完全不灵。崔凤祥毫不动摇地站在工人阶级的立场上，粉碎了奸商的一切阴谋。
    春节前夕，奸商周维英被人民法院逮捕，廉洁奉公的共产党员崔凤祥控诉了周维英腐蚀干部的罪行。他说：“人民政府应当严厉地惩办这些坑害人的奸商。”
