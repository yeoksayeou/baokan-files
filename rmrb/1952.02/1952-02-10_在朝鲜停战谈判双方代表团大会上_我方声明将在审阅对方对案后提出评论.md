    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th. At the Korean armistice talks delegates conference on the 9th, the other side claimed to have carefully studied our proposal for the fifth agenda item and presented a counterproposal. Our representative stated that after reviewing and studying the other party's counterproposal, our side will offer comments at the delegates conference at 10:00 am on the 10th.
    The staff meeting on the third agenda item made no progress because the other side overturned previous agreements, insisting on large numbers for military personnel rotation and the number of specific rear ports.
    In the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, the two sides exchanged views on issues such as the location for the handover of prisoners of war, repatriation agencies, and joint Red Cross groups from both sides to assist in repatriation.

    在朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我方声明将在审阅对方对案后提出评论
    【新华社开城九日电】九日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，对方声称仔细地研究了我方对于第五项议程的提案，并提出了对案。我方代表声明将在审阅与研究对方对案后，在十日上午十时的双方代表团大会上提出我方的评论。
    第三项议程的参谋会议由于对方推翻前议，坚持庞大的军事人员的轮换数字和后方特定口岸的数目，未获任何进展。
    第四项议程的参谋会议中，双方就战俘交接地点、遣俘机构及协助遣俘的双方红十字会联合小组等问题交换了意见。
