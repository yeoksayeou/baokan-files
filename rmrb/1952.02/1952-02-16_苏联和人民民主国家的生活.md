            Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
            Seven Years Since the Liberation of Budapest
    Seven years ago, on February 13th, the glorious Soviet army crushed the stubborn resistance of the Hitlerite army and the Hungarian accomplice army, liberating the Hungarian capital from the fascist reign of terror and bringing freedom and peace to the people of Budapest.
    After seven years of recovery and construction, the face of Budapest has now changed. The bridges connecting Buda and Pest (Budapest is composed of Buda and Pest, with the beautiful Danube River flowing in between) have been repaired, and the city's transportation lines have been greatly improved and modernized. In the first year of the Five-Year Plan, the number of passengers carried by trams and buses will double compared to the pre-war year of 1937. During the Five-Year Plan period, the eight-kilometer-long line of Budapest's new subway will be completed. The express trains running on this line will connect the eastern and western parts of the capital, saving the people of Budapest six million hours of time each year due to this comfortable and rapid means of transportation.
    The people of Budapest, seven years after liberation, are living their free, happy, and joyful lives. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Rakosi, they are implementing the Five-Year Plan with increased production, building their country, and defending peace.
            Centenary of the Birth of Romanian Great Writer Caragiale
    February 10th marked the centenary of the birth of the great Romanian writer Ion Luca Caragiale. The people of the Romanian capital held a commemorative meeting on the afternoon of the 10th in the hall of the Romanian Literary Association. Those present included the Romanian party and government leaders, as well as representatives from the Soviet Union, China, various people's democratic countries, and free Greece.
    The meeting began with an opening speech by Sadoveanu, Chairman of the Romanian Committee for the Defense of Peace, followed by an introduction to Caragiale's life and works by Academician Calinescu. Representatives from the Soviet Union and China also spoke at the meeting, and the conference received congratulatory telegrams from literary and artistic groups in Korea and Albania.
    Note: Ion Luca Caragiale was a famous Romanian writer and playwright, author of famous plays such as "A Lost Letter," "Stormy Night," and "Carnival Events," as well as many novels. His works fiercely criticized and opposed the corruption, hypocrisy, and moral depravity of the Romanian landlord-bourgeois ruling group, and opposed the Romanian feudal dynasty, and were therefore widely welcomed and loved by the Romanian people.
