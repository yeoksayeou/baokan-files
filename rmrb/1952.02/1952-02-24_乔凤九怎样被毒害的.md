    At No. 211, Beida Street, Dongsi Arch, Beijing, there is a storefront facing west. The door is painted with the eye-catching red characters "Injection of Blood-Cleansing Medicine." Inside, there are plaques hanging with phrases like "Remarkable Medical Skills." This is the "Guangming Clinic." The doctor, Zou Ruitian, is 41 years old and from Changchun, Jilin Province. He also serves as the school doctor for seven schools, seemingly a good doctor. But in reality, he is engaged in the criminal activity of manufacturing and selling drugs, and is also a large real estate broker.

    Before and after the liberation of Beijing, Zou Ruitian made and sold more than 3,000 wa of morphine. In order to defraud and steal state property in housing transactions, he not only used various despicable means to drag revolutionary cadres into the water, like other illegal capitalists, but also constantly poisoned revolutionary cadres with morphine. The conspicuous example is using more than 700 cc of morphine solution to poison Qiao Fengjiu, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Machinery Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry.

    Zou Ruitian and Qiao Fengjiu met in April 1950 when Qiao Fengjiu asked him to buy a house for the Machinery Bureau. After Zou Ruitian took Qiao Fengjiu to see a house for sale in Jinyu Hutong, Qiao Fengjiu's stomach hurt. Seeing the business card of "Guangming Clinic" that Zou Ruitian gave him, he asked, "Is there a way to treat it?" Zou Ruitian replied, "Yes, I have pain-relieving medicine." The pain-relieving medicine Zou Ruitian was talking about was morphine.

    After six injections of morphine, Qiao Fengjiu finally became addicted to morphine. He couldn't get through the day without an injection, and even needed two injections a day. This continued for three months, and Qiao Fengjiu was completely drawn to Zou Ruitian's side.

    In order to get morphine injections, Qiao Fengjiu had to allow Zou Ruitian to arbitrarily raise prices in real estate transactions with the public, and steal large amounts of commissions. Zou Ruitian introduced Qiao Fengjiu to more than 80 houses, and six of them were sold. According to Zou Ruitian's confession, he obtained nearly 30 million yuan in illegal commissions. He and Qiao Fengjiu agreed that a quarter of the commission would go to Qiao Fengjiu. But all the money was kept by Zou Ruitian for Qiao Fengjiu to use for morphine. Whenever a house was bought, Zou Ruitian would say to Qiao Fengjiu, "Get an injection, it doesn't matter, you still have money saved." When a deal could not be made for a long time, Zou Ruitian would tell Qiao Fengjiu, "You don't have much money left!" Thus, under the pressure of morphine addiction, Qiao Fengjiu had to buy the bad houses introduced by Zou Ruitian at high prices. For example, the new Kailu dormitory of the Machinery Bureau, the courtyard was small and the house was in bad condition, and the purchase price was 105 pi of fine cloth. According to the market price at the time, it was at least 20 pi higher.

    After injecting more than 700 cc of morphine, Qiao Fengjiu himself has now become pale, thin, and unrecognizable. He has become a victim of morphine.

    乔凤九怎样被毒害的
    李翼
    北京市东四牌楼北大街二百十一号，有一间坐东朝西的门面。门上涂着醒目的“注射清血药针”六个红字。里面挂着“医术精奇”之类的匾额。这是“光明诊疗所”。大夫邹瑞田，现年四十一岁，吉林省长春人。他兼任着七个学校的校医，好像是一个不坏的大夫。但在实际上，他却干着制造和贩卖毒品的罪恶勾当，并且是一个大房纤。
    在北京解放前后，邹瑞田自制并出售吗啡共达三千多瓦。为了在房屋交易中诈骗和盗窃国家财产，他不仅像其他不法资本家一样用各种卑劣手段拖革命干部下水，并且不断地用吗啡毒害革命干部。用七百多西西吗啡液毒害中央重工业部机器局总务科长乔凤九，即是显明的一例。
    邹瑞田和乔凤九相识，是在一九五○年四月乔凤九托他给机器局买房子的时候。邹瑞田领着乔凤九看完了金鱼胡同一所要出售的房子以后，乔凤九的胃有些痛。他看到邹瑞田给他的印有“光明诊疗所”的名片，就问：“有办法医治吗？”邹瑞田回答：“有，我有止痛的药。”邹瑞田所说的止痛药，就是吗啡。
    乔凤九在打过六针吗啡之后，终于上了吗啡瘾。每天不打针就过不去，甚至一天要打两针。这样一直继续了三个月之久，乔凤九就完全被吸引在邹瑞田的身边了。
    为了注射吗啡针，乔凤九就不得不让邹瑞田在和公家进行房产交易中任意提高价格，窃取大量佣金。邹瑞田共向乔凤九介绍过房屋八十余所，成交者六所。据邹瑞田自供，他共获非法佣金近三千万元。他和乔凤九约定：佣金的四分之一归乔凤九。但都存在邹瑞田处，供乔凤九打吗啡用。每当一所房屋买成之后，邹瑞田就向乔凤九说：“打针吧，没关系，你还有存钱。”在较长时间不能成交时，邹瑞田就向乔凤九表示：“你的存钱没有多少啦！”这样，乔凤九在吗啡瘾的逼迫下，就不得不用大价钱收买邹瑞田介绍的坏房。如机器局新开路宿舍，院小房坏，买价一百零五疋细布。按当时市价，至少高出二十疋。
    乔凤九本人在注射了七百多西西吗啡以后，现在变得面色灰暗、体格消瘦，不成人样子了。他作了吗啡的牺牲品。
