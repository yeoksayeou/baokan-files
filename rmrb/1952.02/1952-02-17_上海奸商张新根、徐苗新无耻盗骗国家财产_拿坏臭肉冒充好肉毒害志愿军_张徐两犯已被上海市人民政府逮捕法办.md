Shanghai profiteers Zhang Xingen and Xu Miaoxin unscrupulously stole and swindled state property
Poisoning the Volunteer Army with rotten meat disguised as good meat
Criminals Zhang and Xu have been arrested and brought to justice by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government

The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has ordered the arrest of two unscrupulous profiteers who, with utter disregard for conscience, sold large quantities of bad, rotten, and horse meat as good beef to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. These two profiteers are Zhang Xingen of the United Beef Shop and Xu Miaoxin of the Xu Fuji Beef Shop. During last year's nationwide movement to enthusiastically support and慰劳 the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they acted with utter inhumanity, disregarding the safety and health of the Volunteer Army soldiers, mixing large quantities of bad, rotten, and horse meat with good beef and selling it to the Yimin Industrial Company of the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department for the production of canned beef for the Volunteer Army. They also used despicable methods to collude with cadres, dispatching henchmen to infiltrate state-owned enterprises, establishing strongholds, and wantonly stealing state wealth. Their crimes fully demonstrate the extent to which the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks over the past three years have become malicious and shameless.

In February 1951, the Yimin Industrial Company of the East China Industry Department needed to purchase a large amount of fresh beef to produce canned beef in support of the Volunteer Army. Profiteers Zhang Xingen, Xu Miaoxin, and others, through the introduction of Yang Boqing (a corrupt element) of the Logistics Command of the Shanghai Air Defense Command, undertook the task of purchasing beef on their behalf. Because this was an urgent military supply task and the quantity needed at the time was large while the supply on the market was limited, the two profiteers, Zhang and Xu, seized this opportunity to blackmail the Yimin Industrial Company, saying, "You must buy from us in the future. If you buy from other companies, it will lead to panic buying, and we will not be able to supply you." They attempted to monopolize the business through this means. At the same time, they colluded with the Yimin Industrial Company's personnel in charge to take the opportunity to demand high prices, selling beef purchased at an average price of 3,200 to 4,100 yuan per jin to the Yimin Company at an average price of more than 6,600 yuan per jin. From February to July of last year, the two profiteers, Zhang and Xu, purchased more than 893,000 jin of beef on behalf of the company, stealing as much as 2 to 3 billion yuan from the funds of the people of the motherland who supported the Volunteer Army.

The two profiteers, Zhang and Xu, not only exploited loopholes in the price of beef, but even more maliciously played tricks on the quality of the beef. During June and July of last year, in the more than 300,000 jin of beef that Xu and Zhang sold to the Yimin Company, at least 60 jin of water buffalo meat were mixed in every 100 jin of beef. With a price difference of 500 yuan per jin between water buffalo meat and yellow beef, they made a huge profit of more than 260 million yuan. They also used horse meat to impersonate beef (the price of horse meat is only one-third of that of beef). According to the estimates of the delivery worker Zhu Amao and the moving team leader Shao Jingen, who saw it with their own eyes, there were more than 60,000 jin. The crimes of Zhang Xingen and Xu Miaoxin did not stop there. They even acted with extreme inhumanity, using rotten beef that had turned green to impersonate good meat. Every day, they purchased 1,000 jin of leftover sub-quality and bad meat from small vegetable markets, together with bad beef and dead beef purchased that evaded taxes and evaded inspection by the Health Bureau, and sold it to the Yimin Company as good beef. According to the preliminary confession of the accountant of the profiteer Xu Miaoxin, two-thirds of the 300,000 jin of meat sold in June and July of last year were sub-quality and bad meat. They first scraped off the outer layer of green from the rotten beef that had turned green with a knife, soaked it in sulfuric acid water, and after freezing it in a cold storage, they mixed it with good meat and sent it to the first and second factories of the Yimin Industrial Company. Sometimes, when the company discovered that they had mixed in bad meat and returned the goods, they would apply a layer of cow blood to the returned meat, store it in the cold storage for a while, and then send it back as before.

The reason why the two profiteers, Zhang and Xu, were able to steal state property and suck the blood and sweat of the people so unscrupulously was because they had bought off the personnel in charge of the Yimin Industrial Company of the East China Industry Department. Among these personnel in charge, from the business section chief to the weighers, most of them had been bribed by them and became their agents. The profiteer Zhang Xingen also introduced twelve trusted followers to work in the Yimin Company's factory as meat cutters, helping them to mix rotten meat with good meat and steal state property.

The profiteers Zhang Xingen and Xu Miaoxin were originally beef vendors with only a few million yuan in capital. Since undertaking the beef purchasing business, they have been transformed into big bosses. They also used the money stolen from the funds of the people of the motherland supporting the Volunteer Army to partner with other businessmen to take over the Huafu Hotel as a "base camp" for enticing and corrupting cadres and carrying out illegal activities. After the Shanghai Municipal People's Government grasped the criminal materials of the two profiteers Xu and Zhang, it gave them opportunities to encourage them to confess voluntarily. However, the profiteer Zhang Xingen and others remained unrepentant and attempted to form an "alliance of defense" with relevant personnel, refusing to confess. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government then arrested the two criminals Zhang and Xu and brought them to justice. Li Zonglian, the chief person in charge of purchasing beef and the supply section chief of the Yimin Industrial Company of the East China Industry Department, has also been dismissed from his post by the East China Industry Department for investigation.

    上海奸商张新根、徐苗新无耻盗骗国家财产
    拿坏臭肉冒充好肉毒害志愿军
    张徐两犯已被上海市人民政府逮捕法办
    上海市人民政府下令逮捕了两名丧心病狂以大批坏肉、臭肉和马肉混充好牛肉卖给人民志愿军的恶毒奸商。这两个奸商是联合牛肉庄张新根和徐福记牛肉庄徐苗新。他们在去年全国人民热烈支援中国人民志愿军的慰劳运动中，竟丧尽天良地不顾志愿军战士的安全和健康，把大批坏肉、臭肉和马肉混充好牛肉卖给华东军政委员会工业部益民工业公司，为志愿军制造罐头牛肉。并用卑劣手段勾引干部，派遣爪牙混入国营企业，设立据点，恣意盗骗国家财富。他们的罪行，充分证明了三年来资产阶级的猖狂进攻已到了多么恶毒与无耻的程度。
    一九五一年二月，华东工业部益民工业公司因承制支援志愿军的罐头牛肉，需要购买大量新鲜牛肉。奸商张新根、徐苗新等经上海市防空司令部后勤司令部杨伯卿（系一贪污分子）的介绍，承接了代购牛肉的任务。由于这是一个紧急军需任务，且当时需要的数量很大，市场上供应的数量不多，张、徐两奸商就抓住这一机会向益民工业公司要挟说：“以后必须向我们买，如向别家去买就形成抢购，我们就无法供应了。”他们企图借此进行独占。同时，他们就串通益民工业公司经办人员乘机索取高价，将平均每斤三千二百元到四千一百元买进的牛肉，以平均每斤六千六百多元的高价售与益民公司，从去年二月到七月，张、徐两奸商先后共代购牛肉八十九万三千多斤，共计盗窃祖国人民支援志愿军的款项达二三十亿元之巨。
    张、徐两奸商不仅在牛肉的价格上钻空子，更恶毒的是在牛肉的品质上玩花样。在去年六七月间，徐、张两奸商卖给益民公司的三十多万斤牛肉中，每一百斤牛肉中至少要混杂水牛肉六十斤。水牛肉和黄牛肉每斤差价以五百元计算，他们从中所获暴利就达二亿六千多万元。他们还用马肉冒充牛肉（马肉价仅及牛肉三分之一），仅根据提货工人朱阿毛和搬运组长邵金根亲眼看到的情形估计，就有六万多斤。张新根、徐苗新的罪行还不止此，他们竟丧尽天良，用发了绿的臭牛肉来冒充好肉。他们每天要在小菜场收购卖剩下来的次肉、坏肉一千斤，连同收购来的逃税和逃避卫生局检验的坏牛肉、死牛肉等一起当好牛肉卖给益民公司。据奸商徐苗新的会计初步坦白，在去年六七月间售出的三十万斤肉中，就有三分之二的次肉和坏肉。他们把发绿的臭牛肉，先用刀将外面一层绿色刮去，放在硫酸水里浸过，放到冷藏库冰过后，就夹到好肉中，向益民工业公司所属第一第二两个厂里送。有时，该公司发现他们混用了坏肉，将货退回，他们就又在退回的肉上涂一层牛血，放到冷藏库内去贮藏一些时候，然后依旧送去。
    张、徐两奸商所以能够这样肆无忌惮地盗骗国家财产，吮吸人民的血汗，是因为他们收买了华东工业部益民工业公司的经办人员。在这些经办人员中，从业务科长到过磅员，大部分都受过他们的贿赂，成为他们的代理人。奸商张新根并介绍了十二个亲信到益民公司的厂里去担任切肉工作，帮助他们将臭肉混充好肉，窃取国家资财。
    奸商张新根、徐苗新原来是只有几百万元资本的牛肉摊贩，自从承接了代购牛肉生意后，就一变而为大老板了。他们并用从祖国人民支援志愿军的款项中盗骗来的钱和其他商人合伙盘进了华府饭店，作为引诱腐蚀干部和进行不法勾当的“大本营”。上海市人民政府在掌握了徐、张两奸商的犯罪材料后，曾予以机会，促其自动坦白。但奸商张新根等仍然执迷不悟，并企图和有关人员订立“攻守同盟”，拒绝坦白。上海市人民政府当将张、徐两犯逮捕法办。购买牛肉的主要经办人、华东工业部益民工业公司供应科科长李宗莲也已由华东工业部撤职查办。    （新华社）
