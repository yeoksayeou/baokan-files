    Certain Unlawful Professional Accountants in Shanghai
    Accept Bribes to Help Capitalists Evade Taxes
    Shanghai Tax Bureau Should Also Be Thoroughly Inspected
    Comrade Editor: I am now exposing a fact about how professional accountants in Shanghai help the bourgeoisie attack the national tax authorities.

    In January 1950, when the Shanghai Tax Bureau was about to levy the second half of 1949's business income tax, it decided to entrust a group of accountants as special auditors. On one hand, they would help industrial and commercial households without professional accounting to prepare audit reports; on the other hand, they would assist the tax bureau in auditing. The Shanghai Tax Bureau published the "Provisional Measures for Hiring Special Auditors" in the "Liberation Daily" (see page 5 of the January 21, 1950, Liberation Daily), and later stipulated that industrial and commercial households audited by special auditors would no longer participate in the evaluation (this point was later changed due to problems). As far as I know, the first batch of special auditors included Xu Yongzuo, Chen Wenlin, Li Wenjie, Chao Jimei, Zhu Shangyi, Xie Chunpu, and 15 others.

    After these "auditors" accepted the government's entrustment and obtained legitimate status, many industrial and commercial households competed to hire them. Many of them took advantage of the legitimate status given by the Shanghai Tax Bureau, accepted bribes from capitalists, and secretly tried to help industrial and commercial households conceal, falsely report, and fabricate accounts, causing huge losses to national tax revenue. For example, Chen Wenlin accepted a lot of "audit fees" and "consulting fees" from Hongsheng Firm; Li Wenjie helped Dasheng Cotton Mill forge false accounts; Xie Chunpu helped Yuchang Electrical Material Store on Zhejiang Road conceal and falsely report, and so on. The "remuneration" given to them by merchants was as high as 4,000 discounted units. Among them, Chen Wenlin, Li Wenjie, and Zhu Shangyi had prepared accounts for hundreds of households. Because "Li Wenjie Accounting Firm" did not have enough staff, it also hired students who had not graduated from Soochow University to help with "auditing" affairs (Li was then a professor at Soochow University). In addition to accepting "employment" from general industrial and commercial households, Xu Yongzuo also reported accounts for JinCheng Bank and Shanghai Bank; Chao Jimei reported accounts for Shanghai Electric Power Company. Because they colluded with each other and acted in collusion, most of the industrial and commercial households that they audited and reported on reported losses, or reported less than they should have. In the name of "consultants" and "audits," the amount of income tax that they helped capitalists evade and fail to pay to the state is difficult to calculate.

    This group of professional accountants has always colluded with the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie in the past and became their pawns; after liberation, they are still greedy and collude with the bourgeoisie to attack the national tax authorities wildly; this kind of sinful and illegal behavior is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country. The Shanghai Tax Bureau gave these bad elements legitimate status, which allowed them to exploit loopholes and caused incalculable losses to national tax revenue. This rash measure was also completely wrong. I suggest that the relevant departments in East China and the Shanghai Savings Inspection Committee, in the current anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement in the industrial and commercial circles, in addition to mobilizing industrial and commercial households to confess thoroughly, also mobilize the masses to report these unlawful accountants who cover up for the bourgeoisie and wildly attack the national tax authorities, and at the same time organize a special inspection team to inspect and urge Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie and others to quickly and thoroughly confess their crimes to the people. The leading organs should also conduct a thorough inspection of the work of the Shanghai Tax Bureau.

### 上海市某些不法专业会计师  接受贿赂帮助资本家偷税  上海市税务局也应彻底检查

    上海市某些不法专业会计师
    接受贿赂帮助资本家偷税
    上海市税务局也应彻底检查
    编辑同志：我现在揭发一件上海市的专业会计师帮助资产阶级向国家税收机关进攻的事实。
    上海市税务局在一九五○年一月间将要开征一九四九年下半年营利事业所得税时，曾决定委托一批会计师为特约查账员，一面帮助没有专业会计的工商户作查账报告书，一面协助税局查账。上海市税务局在“解放日报”上公布了“聘请特约查账员暂行办法”（见一九五○年一月二十一日解放日报第五版），后又规定经特约查账员查过账的工商户，即可不再参加评议（此点因以后发现有问题，又加以改变）。据我所知，第一期被特约的查账员有徐永祚、陈文麟、李文杰、巢纪梅、朱尚一、谢春溥等十五人。
    这些“查账员”在接受政府委托、取得合法地位以后，就被很多工商户竞相登聘。他们之中的许多人，竟利用上海市税务局给予的合法地位，接受资本家贿赂，暗中设法帮助工商户隐瞒、伪报、造假账，给国家税收造成了巨大的损失。例如：陈文麟接受宏牲商行很多“查账费”、“顾问费”；李文杰帮助大生纱厂伪造假账；谢春溥帮助浙江路裕昌电料行隐瞒、伪报，等等。商人给他们的“酬劳”，有高达四千折实单位者。其中陈文麟、李文杰、朱尚一都曾替几百户作账。“李文杰事务所”因为人不够用，还找了东吴大学未毕业的学生，帮忙代办
    “查账”事务（李当时曾任东吴大学教授）。徐永祚除接受一般工商户的“聘请”外，并代金城银行、上海银行报账；巢纪梅代上海电力公司报账，由于他们互相勾结，狼狈为奸，因此，凡是经过他们代为查账报账的工商户，大部都是报亏本，或以多报少的。他们借“顾问”和“查账”的名义，帮助资本家逃漏了的应向国家交纳的所得税款，是难以统计的。
    这一批专业会计师在过去一贯和官僚买办资产阶级勾结，成为他们的爪牙；解放后仍然利欲薰心，和资产阶级一道向国家税收机关猖狂进攻；这种罪恶的犯法行为，是全国人民所绝对不能容许的。上海市税务局给这些坏分子以合法的身份，因而使他们钻了空子，给国家税收造成难以计算的损失，这种轻率的措施，也是完全错误的。我建议华东有关部门和上海市节约检查委员会，在目前工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中，除发动工商户彻底坦白外，还要动员群众检举这些给资产阶级打掩护，向国家税收机关猖狂进攻的不法会计师，同时组织专门检查小组，检查并督促徐永祚、李文杰等人迅速彻底向人民坦白认罪。领导机关对上海市税务局的工作，也应当进行彻底的检查。
