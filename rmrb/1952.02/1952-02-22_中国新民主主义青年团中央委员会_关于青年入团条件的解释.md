What qualifications must a young person possess to join the Communist Youth League? Article 3 of the League Constitution stipulates: "Any young man or woman aged 14 to 25 (calculated according to actual age), who supports the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, is willing to actively strive for the cause of the New Democratic revolution, is willing to loyally serve the working people, acknowledges the League Constitution, obeys resolutions, and participates in the work of the League, may apply to join the League."

From this, it can be seen that a young person applying to join the League must first meet the age requirements mentioned above; second, their history must be thoroughly investigated (to prevent counter-revolutionaries from pretending to be revolutionary and infiltrating the League to carry out sabotage). Apart from these, as long as the following three conditions are met, they can be admitted to the League according to the procedures for joining the League. These three conditions are: (1) ideological progress; (2) active work; (3) acknowledgment of the League Constitution and program, and obedience to the League's resolutions.

It is necessary to understand the content and interrelationship of these three conditions.

I. Ideological Progress. This means that admitting a new League member requires them to have a certain degree of political awareness, to be willing to loyally serve the working people, and to be willing to strive for the construction of China's New Democracy and the future of socialism; that is to say, it requires them to understand that the Chinese Communist Party is the sole leader of the Chinese people's revolutionary victory and the thorough realization of China's New Democracy, to understand that the Chinese Communist Party is the organizer and leader of the Communist Youth League of China, that the Youth League is the Party's loyal and close assistant, and that every League member should support the Party's propositions, study the Party's theories and policies, and under the leadership of the Party, consciously strive to defend and build the new China, and strive for the complete liberation of all mankind.

II. Active Work. A young person applying to join the League should not only understand the above revolutionary principles and express a willingness to do so, but must also have actual revolutionary actions. They should actively participate in the patriotic movements called upon by the Party and the People's Government, such as resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the current movements against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, and in order to defend and build the motherland, consciously at their own work posts (for example, worker and peasant youth on production posts, military youth on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea and national defense posts, students on the posts of ideological transformation, strengthening proletarian ideological arming, and mastering scientific and cultural knowledge, and youth workers in all aspects of agencies and schools on various business posts), give play to their initiative and creativity.

III. Acknowledgment of the League Constitution and Program, and Obedience to the League's Resolutions. Every young person applying to join the League should understand that the Youth League is an organized revolutionary group organized and working according to the League Constitution and Program. Therefore, if they want to apply to join the League, they must acknowledge the League Constitution and Program, and be determined to obey the League's resolutions and actively complete the various tasks assigned by the League.

The above three conditions are completely unified and should not be neglected in any way. If the condition of "ideological progress" is ignored, it will lead to admitting a young person to the League based on temporary active performance; without a certain degree of political awareness, they may be hot and cold after joining the League and unable to continue to work actively, or they may join the League not to better defend and build the motherland, but for selfish personal purposes. If the condition of "active work" is ignored, some empty talkers who only talk and do not act, and whose words and deeds are inconsistent, will be admitted. If only the two conditions of "ideological progress" and "active work" are emphasized, while the condition of "acknowledgment of the League Constitution and program, and obedience to the League's resolutions" is ignored, the conditions for joining the League will obviously be lowered, and the League's organization and combat effectiveness will be weakened. These incorrect practices have occurred in the past in the development of League members, have been corrected, and must continue to be prevented. However, on the other hand, if the requirements for "ideological progress" are too high, stipulating that a "communist worldview" must be established, requiring reaching the level of a "probationary Communist Party member," or if the requirements for "active work" are too high, believing that it is necessary to pass the test of several major movements, and consistently perform actively to be qualified, if not, even if a young person fully meets the regulations, has a clear history, has improved their ideological awareness in the current major movement, works very actively, acknowledges the League Constitution and Program, and is willing to obey the League's resolutions, it is still considered not enough to meet the conditions for joining the League, or the work of consolidating the League's organization is understood one-sidedly and passively, and the work of development is rejected; this will keep the young people who already meet the conditions for joining the League outside the League's door for a long time. This kind of understanding and practice is also incorrect. This has become a serious obstacle to the development of League members at present and should be thoroughly corrected.

It should also be understood that in order to correctly grasp the conditions for joining the League and timely accept advanced young people into the League, it is also necessary to conduct regular and planned observation and education of activists among young people in actual work. Whether each new League member admitted to the League meets the conditions stipulated in the League Constitution is inseparable from the League organization's cultivation and education of them; therefore, in addition to educating the general youth masses in various actual struggles and work, and constantly improving their awareness, each League branch should also plan to assign League members to use various forms to conduct in-depth understanding and education of the youth activists who are constantly emerging in the movement, and conduct a comprehensive observation in the work according to the conditions stipulated in the League Constitution. This should become the regular work of the branch and the obligation of every League member. In this way, the conditions stipulated in the League Constitution can be correctly grasped and the League's organization can be soundly consolidated and strengthened.

### 中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会  关于青年入团条件的解释

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于青年入团条件的解释
    具备什么条件的青年，才能加入青年团呢？团章第三条是这样规定的：“凡年在十四岁以上、二十五岁以下（均按实足年龄计算）的男女青年，拥护中国共产党的主张，愿为新民主主义的革命事业积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务；承认团章，服从决议，参加本团工作者，皆可申请入团。”
    由此可见，要求入团的青年，第一、年龄必须符合上述规定；第二、他的历史必须审查清楚（不能让反革命分子假装革命混入团内，进行破坏）。除此以外，只要具备以下三个条件即可按入团手续吸收入团。这三个条件就是：（一）思想进步；（二）工作积极；（三）承认团章团纲，服从团的决议。
    应当了解这三个条件的内容与相互的关系。
    一、思想进步。这就是说吸收一个新团员要求他具有一定的政治觉悟，自愿为劳动人民忠诚服务，自愿为中国的新民主主义的建设和社会主义前途而奋斗；也就是说，要求他懂得中国共产党是中国人民革命胜利和中国新民主主义彻底实现的唯一领导者，懂得中国共产党是中国新民主主义青年团的组织者和领导者，青年团是共产党的忠实的亲密的助手，每个团员应拥护党的主张，学习党的理论和政策，在党的领导下，自觉地为保卫和建设新中国而奋斗，为全人类的彻底解放而奋斗。
    二、工作积极。一个要求入团的青年，不应只是懂得以上的革命道理、表示愿意照着这样做，而且必须有实际的革命行动。他应该积极参加党和人民政府所号召的爱国主义运动，如抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命和当前的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动等，并为了保卫和建设祖国，自觉地在自己的工作岗位上（例如工农青年在生产岗位上，部队青年在抗美援朝前线和国防的岗位上，学生在思想改造、加强无产阶级思想武装和掌握科学文化知识的岗位上，机关学校各方面青年工作者在各个业务岗位上），发挥自己的积极性和创造性。
    三、承认团纲团章、服从团的决议。每个要求入团的青年，应该懂得青年团是根据团纲团章组织起来和进行工作的有组织的革命团体，因此，他要申请入团就必须承认团纲团章，并决心服从团的决议，积极地完成团所分配的各种任务。
    以上三个条件是完全统一的，不应有任何偏废。如果忽视了“思想进步”这一条件，就会发生根据一时的积极表现吸收一个青年入团；而没有一定的政治觉悟，他入团后可能时冷时热，不能继续积极工作，或者他入团不是为了更好地保卫和建设祖国，而是为了个人自私的目的。如果忽视了“工作积极”这一条件，就会吸收一些光讲不做，言行不一的空谈家。如果只强调“思想进步”“工作积极”两条，而忽视了“承认团纲团章、服从团的决议”这一条，显然也降低了入团条件，削弱了团的组织性和战斗性。这些不正确的作法，在过去发展团员中曾经发生过，已经纠正并须继续注意防止。但是另一方面，如果对“思想进步”要求过高，规定必须树立起“共产主义的人生观”，要求达到“候补共产党党员”的水平，或者对“工作积极”一条要求过高，认为必须经过几次大运动的考验，一贯地表现积极才够格，若不是这样，即使一个青年完全符合规定，历史清楚，在当前的一次大运动中思想觉悟提高了，工作很积极，承认团纲团章，愿意服从团的决议，还以为不够入团条件，或片面消极地了解巩固团的组织，而拒绝发展工作；这样就把已经具备入团条件的青年，长期关在团的门外。这种认识和作法也是不正确的。这在目前已成为发展团员的严重障碍，应该彻底纠正。
    还应当了解为了正确地掌握入团的条件，及时地接受先进青年入团，还必须在实际工作中对青年中的积极分子经常地有计划地进行考察和教育。每一个被吸收入团的新团员，是否符合团章所规定的条件，是与团组织对他的培养教育分不开的；为此，每一个团支部，除了在各种实际斗争和工作中对一般的青年群众进行教育，不断提高他们的觉悟以外，还应当有计划地对在运动中不断涌现出来的青年积极分子，分配团员采用各种形式对他们进行深入的了解和教育，并在工作中根据团章所规定的条件作全面的考察。这应成为支部经常的工作和每个团员的义务。这样，对团章所规定的条件才能正确地掌握和健全地巩固与壮大团的组织。
