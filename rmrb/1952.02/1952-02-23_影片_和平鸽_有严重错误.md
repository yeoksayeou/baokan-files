To the Editor: The film "Peace Dove" depicts Shanghai medical workers enthusiastically participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and going to the front lines to do medical work. The theme is very good. But I think the film has serious errors and shortcomings. It distorts the working class, portraying workers as undisciplined, crude, and foolish; it promotes petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideas, placing the key to ideological transformation in a love triangle story, neglecting the leadership of the Party and the government and the influence of the great victories of the people across the country on various fronts; it distorts the image of the Communist Youth League members; and promotes the individualistic idea of ​​the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie striving for personal fame and status. I believe that for films of this kind with errors and shortcomings, relevant departments and film critics should organize critical articles before the screening and publish them in newspapers during the screening to educate filmmakers and audiences.

    影片“和平鸽”有严重错误
    编辑同志：电影“和平鸽”描写的是上海医务工作者热烈参加抗美援朝运动，到前线去作医疗工作的情形，主题是很好的。但我认为影片具有严重的错误和缺点。它歪曲了工人阶级，把工人写得自由散漫，粗鲁愚笨；它宣扬了小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想，把思想转变的关键放在三角恋爱的故事上，忽略了党和政府的领导以及全国人民在各个战线上的伟大胜利的影响；它歪曲了青年团员的形象；宣传了资产阶级和小资产阶级的为个人名誉地位而奋斗的个人主义思想。我认为对于这一类具有错误和缺点的影片，有关部门和电影评论者应在放映前组织批评文字，在影片放映时，刊载在报纸上，以教育电影工作者和观众。    杨干友
