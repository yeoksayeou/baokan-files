    The Xingcheng Sanatorium of the Chinese Railway Workers
    Should Not Postpone the Launch of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
    To the Editor: I am a recuperating worker at the Xingcheng Sanatorium of the Chinese Railway Workers. The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign has not yet truly begun in the sanatorium. The leadership of the sanatorium only made a plan to launch the campaign on January 19th; then, they emphasized that the Spring Festival was approaching and postponed the campaign. The leading cadres of the sanatorium have serious bureaucratic work styles. For example, the sanatorium formulated a patriotic pact, but the leading cadres only inspected it once. Many recuperating workers have opinions but dare not raise them, fearing that the leadership will find fault and order them to leave the hospital. As far as I know, several workers have already been discharged. I think that the leadership of the sanatorium should quickly lead the masses to launch this campaign and correct this bureaucratic work style.

    中国铁路职工兴城疗养院  
    不应推迟开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    编辑同志：我是中国铁路职工兴城疗养院的疗养员。疗养院的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动到现在还没有真正展开。疗养院的领导方面只在一月十九日作了开展运动的计划；然后，竟强调春节快到，把运动推迟了。疗养院的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。比如疗养院订了一个爱国公约，领导干部一共只检查过一次。很多疗养员有意见不敢提，怕因此被领导方面找出岔子叫出院。据我知道，出院的工人就有几个。我想，疗养院的领导方面应迅速领导群众开展这次运动，纠正这种官僚主义的作风。　王希荣
