Anyone who sees the important national project contracted by Liu Yuanjing, Wan Xuanzhi, Bian Xianchen, and other big swindlers and big thieves in Beijing's private construction industry will be filled with righteous indignation. This project started in November 1950 and was completed at the end of December of the same year. The total contract price was 28.6322 billion yuan. The average unit price per square meter was as high as 1.21 million yuan (excluding sanitation, heating, and lighting equipment. Cement was supplied by the client). According to construction experts, houses built with so much money should have machine-made brick walls, reinforced concrete roofs, steel or good wood doors and windows, hardwood floors or terrazzo floors, heating, electrical, and all sanitary equipment, and a lifespan of at least 100 years. But what kind of houses did these swindlers Liu Yuanjing, Wan Xuanzhi, Bian Xianchen, and others build? Hand-made brick walls, earthenware tile roofs, inferior wood doors and windows, the worst hardware materials and oil finishes. These swindlers stole at least 12.2322 billion yuan from the state, accounting for more than 42.7 percent of the total contract price. What about the lifespan of the houses? Not to mention 100 years, rainwater leakage occurred in the sixth month after completion. And in the past year, problems have arisen one after another, constantly.

The glass on the doors and windows was blown off by the north wind. At first glance, people might think it's a joke, but it's the truth. The reason is simple: in order to steal state property, these thieves made extremely cunning plans for every inch of glass. In many inspected doors and windows, it was found that the glass did not fill the door and window frames, and some even had no nails at all. The connection between the glass and the wooden frame was made of second-rate putty made of white powder mixed with fish oil. After being blown by the wind, it fell off. In all the window putty we saw, there was no place that was not falling off or cracked. Since the putty had fallen off, there were few or no nails, and the glass itself was small, so it would naturally be blown off by the north wind. An entire window pane was blown off by the wind. The reason was that the wooden frame of the window was not nailed to the entire window frame at all. According to Comrade Li Weicao, who manages the houses, more than 2,080 pieces of glass have been replaced in the past year.

Generally, after the doors and windows of a house are closed, the wind should not be able to blow in. But here, the doors and windows are useless, and small and large winds enter as they please. Among more than 20 buildings, not a single door or window meets ordinary standards. Doors shrinking and door and window frames warping and deforming now account for more than 70 percent of all doors and windows. One door could not be closed at all because the door leaf was too thin and warped. One building has ten doors, and the frame of each door is separated from the wall. Among them, there are three door leaves and door frames with gaps of three or four centimeters. The largest separation between the door frame and the wall reaches two centimeters. There are three reasons for these phenomena: (1) the workmanship of the doors and windows is rough; (2) the quality of the wood is poor and too wet; (3) all door and window joints were not glued at all. According to the standard, all doors and windows and wood should use Korean pine and must be made flat and with tight joints. But these swindlers actually used mostly white pine or yellow flower pine. Although most of the knots and cracks in the wood have been whitewashed, they can still be clearly seen.

According to the inspection report, 70 percent of the wood used for purlins, tie rods, diagonal braces, and floors is not up to size, and the average reduction in materials is 17 percent. Among the eight construction factories, the one that used the most standard Korean pine did not exceed 20 percent. Taking the floor as an example, according to the standard, the thickness of the floor should be eight fen, but the actual thickness is only six fen or six fen and five li. Now when people walk on the floor, the floor trembles. We inspected a canteen. When we walked indoors, the plates and bowls on the table rattled because the boards were too thin. In terms of wood, the eight construction factories embezzled and defrauded a total of 4.095 billion yuan.

Heating with a fireplace is originally clean and economical. But the fireplace here has become a mental burden for residents. Every day everyone is worried about whether it will cause a fire. Because the fireplace is roughly built, there are cracks everywhere. According to a survey of two buildings, three of the eight chimneys do not emit smoke. One night last winter, a fireplace caused a fire because flames came out of the cracks in the furnace wall. Many shoes, bags, and supplies were burned, a piece of the ceiling was also burned, and the door of the adjacent room was almost burned. In another building, four people were poisoned because the flue was blocked, the fireplace was cracked, and gas leaked. The comrades living in these houses said to me: "If we were to build the fireplace, we guarantee it would be built better than this. We were almost burned to death. These profiteers deliberately wanted to burn us!"

The thickness of the wall was originally stipulated to be 38 centimeters, but it was actually only made 35 centimeters. The reason is that these swindlers used a large number of smaller Tianjin bricks instead of Beijing bricks. For every cubic meter of brick wall, no more than 500 Tianjin bricks are used at most, but when the final account was settled, the profiteers reported 540 bricks. They also had another way to overreport brick materials, which was to calculate the door and window openings that did not use bricks at all as walls. In the entire building, they overreported a total of 5,050 cubic meters of brick materials, embezzling and defrauding 1.125 billion yuan of state property. Doors, windows, and floors were originally stipulated to be painted. But taking the floor as an example, the profiteers only brushed it once with brown color and extremely light tung oil. In less than a year, all the floors became mottled. The door of one office has faded to white because the paint quality is too bad and there is too little oil.

Here is a house where the entire cement floor has sunk. What is the reason? According to the stipulated standard, the foundation of the house should be 45 centimeters deep, and the excavated original soil should be mixed evenly according to the ratio of "three parts lime and seven parts soil" before being filled in and compacted. But the foundation made by these swindlers was only 35 centimeters deep. The ratio of lime and soil was also changed to 25 to 75. The amount of lime was small, the mixing was not uniform, and it was not compacted. Houses built on such a foundation will naturally not be strong. To varying degrees, cracks have also occurred on many cement surfaces. According to the inspection, many floors not only did not use lime soil, but also did not have crushed brick and three-in-one soil as the base (generally, there should be 15 centimeters of lime soil and 10 centimeters of crushed brick and three-in-one soil). The cement applied to the floor should be at least two centimeters thick according to general standards, but here it is only two to three millimeters. How can such a floor not crack?

Why did the house leak rain after six months? According to the regulations, the asphalt should be 180 degrees, but what they actually used was 130 degrees to 150 degrees. The oil felt should be thick and good, but what they used was bad oil felt of extremely poor quality, almost like oil paper. When brushing the asphalt, it was not actually brushed twice, but once and then touched up. In addition, the quality of the sheathing board was poor and humid, and many oil felts soon cracked due to the wood warping. This has caused the house to leak rain continuously in the past year.

The supervisors of these houses said to me: "Either it has to be completely demolished and rebuilt; or a large repair team must be established immediately to do repair work every day. This raises an extremely difficult question: when will the repair be completed?"

Liu Yuanjing, Wan Xuanzhi, and other big thieves used such vicious methods to embezzle and defraud a large amount of state funds. How can anyone with a patriotic heart not resolutely support the people's government in giving them severe punishment! (Attached pictures)

The house contracted by the profiteers, because the ground is loose and not compacted, the entire ground has sunk, and the most severe sinking is more than two and a half inches.

The house contracted by the profiteers, because of shoddy workmanship and cutting corners, the foundation has sunk, and the wall cracks are almost an inch.

As a result of the profiteers' large-scale reduction of hemp fiber and lime, the gray skin of the eaves generally falls off and cracks.

    从奸商刘元敬等包建的一个工程中看奸商偷工减料破坏国家建设的滔天罪行
    李翼
    北京私营营造业中的大骗子手、大盗窃犯刘元敬、万选之、边宪臣等包建的属于国家的某重要工程，任何人看了都会义愤填膺。这个工程在一九五○年十一月间动工，同年十二月底完工。包建总价是二百八十六亿三千二百万元。每一平方公尺的平均单价，高至一百二十一万元（不包括卫生、暖气、电灯等设备。洋灰由委托者供给）。据建筑工程专家们说，用这样多的钱造成的房屋，应该是机制砖墙，钢筋混凝土房顶，钢或好木料的门窗，硬木地板或水磨石地，有暖气、电气及一切卫生设备，房子的寿命至少是一百年。可是刘元敬、万选之、边宪臣等骗子手所建造的房屋是怎样的呢？人工砖墙，陶瓦顶棚，劣等木料的门窗，最坏的五金材料和油饰。这批骗子手们最低限度盗窃了国家一百二十二亿三千二百万元，占全部包价的百分之四十二点七强。房子的寿命呢？不必说一百年了，在完工后的第六个月，就发生了漏雨现象。而在过去一年中，毛病是一个接着一个，不断地发生。
    门窗上的玻璃，被北风吹掉了。乍一听，人们会以为是说笑话，但这却是事实。原因很简单：这批盗贼为了窃取国家财产，在每一寸玻璃上都做了极诡诈的打算。在被检查过的许多门窗玻璃中，发现玻璃填不满门窗的框子，有的是根本没有钉钉子。在玻璃和木框连接的地方，用的是大白粉拌鱼油做成的次等油腻。经过风吹，就脱落了。在我们所看到的一切门窗玻璃的油腻子，没有一处不脱落或干裂的，油腻既已脱落，钉子钉得很少或根本没有，玻璃本身又小，北风一来，自然会被吹掉。有一叶亮窗，曾整个被风吹落。原因是那亮窗的木框子根本没有用钉子钉到整个窗框上。据管理房屋的李伟操同志说，一年以来，换过的玻璃已有二千零八百多块。
    一般的房子，门窗关闭后，大风应当是吹不进来的。可是在这里，门窗并不顶事，小风大风随便进。在二十多幢房屋中，找不到一个够得上普通标准的门窗。门板缩小、门窗框子翘裂变形的，现已占到全部门窗的百分之七十以上。有一个门因门扇太薄，发生翘闪，已根本无法关拢。有一幢房子有十个门，每个门的门框都和墙壁离开了。其中有三个门扇和门框裂开空隙有三、四公分。门框和墙壁脱裂最大的达到二公分。发生这些现象的原因有三：（一）门窗做工粗糙；（二）木料质量低劣，而且太湿；（三）所有的门窗接缝根本没用鳔胶。照标准，一切门窗和木料都应使用红松，并须做得平直，接缝严密。而这些骗子手们实际上用的绝大多数是白松或黄花松。木材中的节疤、裂缝虽已多数被粉饰，但仍能清楚地看得出来。
    根据检查报告，架檩、拉条、斜撑及地板等所用木料，有百分之七十不够尺寸，偷减材料平均为百分之十七。在八家营造厂中，使用标准红松最多的，也不超过百分之二十。以地板为例，照标准，地板厚度应为八分，实做仅够六分或六分五厘。现在人们走过地板时，地板已发生颤动。我们察看了一所食堂。当我们在室内走动时，由于板料太薄，连桌子上的盘、碗也被震动得叮噹乱响。在木材上，八家营造厂共盗骗四十亿九千五百多万元。
    壁炉取暖，本来是既清洁而又经济的。但壁炉在这里却成了居住者精神上的负担。每天大家都在耽心它是不是会引起火灾。因为壁炉砌修粗糙，到处都是裂缝。根据两幢房屋的调查，在八个烟囱中，有三个冒不出烟。去年冬天的一个夜晚，有一个壁炉因炉墙裂缝冒出了火焰，造成了一次火灾。有很多鞋子、挂包和用品被烧毁了，天花板也被烧坏了一块，旁边的屋门也几乎被烧着。在另外一幢房子里，因为烟道不通，壁炉裂缝，煤气四溢，也曾发生四人中毒的事故。居住在这些房子里的同志们对我说：“要是我们来砌壁炉，保证会比这砌得好。我们几乎被火烧死。这些奸商们是故意想烧我们！”
    屋墙的厚度，原来规定是三十八公分，实际上只做了三十五公分。原因是这些骗子手们用大量的尺寸较小的天津砖代替了北京砖。每一立方公尺的砖墙，用天津砖最多不过五百块，但在最后结账时，奸商们竟报成了五百四十块。他们另外还有一种多报砖料的办法，就是把根本不用砖的门窗口也照墙壁一样计算。在整个建筑中，他们总共多报了五千零五十立方公尺砖料，盗骗国家财产十一亿二千五百多万元。门窗、地板，原来规定是要油漆的。但以地板而论，奸商们只是刷了一次棕色和极淡微的桐油。不到一年，全部地板即成斑白。有一所办公室的大门，因为漆质太坏，油太少的缘故，现在已经褪成白色了。
    这里有一所房屋，洋灰地整块下沉了。什么原故呢？按照规定的标准，房屋的地基应该是深四十五公分，挖出的原土，应按“灰三土七”的比例拌搅均匀后再填下去，用夯打实。但这批骗子手们所做的地基却只有三十五公分深。灰和土的比例，也改成了二五与七五之比。灰量小，拌搅也不均匀，而且没有夯实。在这样的地基上建筑的房屋，自然是不会牢固的。在许多洋灰地面上，也发生了不同程度的裂纹现象。据检查，很多地面不仅没有使用灰土，而且没有碎砖、三合土做底子（一般的应有十五公分灰土，十公分碎砖、三合土）。地面上抹的洋灰，按一般标准至少应该厚二公分，但这里只有二至三公厘。这样的地面怎么会不裂缝呢？
    房屋为什么六个月就漏雨呢？照规定，油膏应该是一百八十度的，但他们实用的是一百三十度到一百五十度的。油毡应该用厚的，好的，但他们用的却是品质极端低劣、和油纸差不多的坏油毡。刷油膏时，也不是实刷两遍，而是实刷一遍，花刷一遍。加上望板品质低劣而且潮湿，不少油毡很快就因为木料走样而破裂。这就使房屋在过去一年中不断发生漏雨现象。
    这些房屋的主管人员对我说：“要不就得把它全部拆掉重建；要不就得马上成立一个人员众多的补修队，天天去做补修工作。这样做就有一个极难解答的问题：什么时候才算修补完毕呢？”
    以刘元敬、万选之为首的这批大盗窃犯，就是用这样恶毒的办法盗骗了国家的大量资财。一切有爱国心肠的人，怎能不坚决地拥护人民政府给予他们以严厉的惩处！（附图片）
    奸商包建的房屋，因地面松软，没有夯实，整个地面下沉，最厉害的下沉了两寸半还多。
    奸商包建的房屋，因偷工减料，地基下沉，墙壁裂缝有将到一寸的。
    奸商大量偷减麻刀、白灰的结果，房檐灰皮普遍脱落裂纹。
