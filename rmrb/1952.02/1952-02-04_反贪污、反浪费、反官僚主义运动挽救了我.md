    The Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement Saved Me
    Xia Maoru

    Editor's Note: Xia Maoru was one of the major corrupt officials tried at the public trial of corrupt officials in Beijing on February 1st. He was exempted from criminal punishment because he automatically and thoroughly confessed and performed meritorious service to atone for his crimes. The following are his thoughts after being released.

    I am a construction engineer. Before liberation, I worked in the construction business in the old society for sixteen years. After liberation, I joined the revolutionary work. Because I came from the old society with a body full of filth and entered the new society, I started engaging in illegal and undisciplined activities less than five months after starting work, and finally became a major corrupt official who stole over 120 million yuan of state assets. I am grateful to the People's Government and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement led by Chairman Mao, which pulled me back from the brink and allowed me to be reborn.

    In February 1950, I joined the East China Grain Administration. When I was sent to the Anhui North Grain Bureau to construct warehouse projects, I had the idea of ​​making a profit from the project. In fact, I did so later; and developed from individual corruption to collective corruption with the engineering personnel who went with me. When the construction contractors began to make various demands on me, asking me to give special preferential treatment in the project, I began to feel fear and unease. In order to avoid being exposed, I requested a transfer, hoping to cover up the crime of corruption and eliminate the inner fear and unease by transferring to another area. However, the reality was completely the opposite. After being transferred to the Central South Grain Administration, I heard successively that the Anhui North grain warehouses had sunk and cracked due to the contractors' cutting corners. This made my ideological burden heavier day by day. I was afraid that my crimes would be discovered, so I could not eat or sleep well. During the most intense ideological struggle, I thought about running away anonymously, committing suicide, and donating the embezzled funds to resist the US and aid Korea. However, none of these ideas relieved my heavy ideological burden in the slightest, and I was still suppressed by fearful thoughts.

    When the great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, I was sent to the Beijing Grain Management Bureau to participate in warehouse design work. At this time, I was even more uneasy. Should I confess? Or should I not confess? These two questions kept plaguing me. At first, I felt that both roads were dead ends, and that I had no way out. When I heard the leaders' earnest mobilization reports, and learned that those who confessed voluntarily could have their crimes reduced, my ideological struggle between confessing and not confessing became more intense. Finally, I decided to choose the path of confession and put down the heavy ideological burden. I confessed all the facts of corruption to the leadership. During the movement, after repeated encouragement, enlightenment, and education from the leadership, I realized the serious harm of my corrupt behavior, and felt that corrupt elements like me should be severely punished by law. At the same time, I also realized that I must respond to the leadership's call to expose all the major corrupt officials and several construction companies that stole state assets in order to atone for my crimes through meritorious service. However, regarding the issue of my punishment, I only knew that "those who confess voluntarily may be given lenient treatment," and "meritorious service can atone for crimes." As for how much the reduction would be, I always held a skeptical attitude and couldn't feel at ease. I once thought: my crimes are serious, and even if the sentence is reduced, I would still be sentenced to more than ten years in prison; but I am already forty-one years old, and if I am imprisoned for ten years, everything will be over. However, these concerns were finally swept away after the public trial of major corrupt officials in Beijing on February 1st.

    Now I have realized that the help given to me by the leadership and comrades in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was entirely to save me, proving that the People's Government will definitely fulfill its policy of giving lenient treatment to corrupt elements who voluntarily confess, repent, and can report and perform meritorious service. Now I have begun to be reborn, and I am deeply grateful that the People's Government has exempted me, a serious major corrupt official, from criminal punishment, giving me a path to self-renewal. I will never forget Chairman Mao and the People's Government's leniency towards me. Now I have realized that there are two completely different types of state workers: one is those who are loyal and wholeheartedly serve the people; the other is those who are selfish and enter government agencies to steal state assets. Yesterday's Xia Maoru belonged to the latter type of personnel—the most shameful corrupt element. I deeply feel that my past crimes were too great, and the losses caused to the country were too great. In the future, I am determined to completely correct my mistakes and start anew. I want to completely abandon the stinking airs of a technician, carry out ideological reform, strive to improve my political level, and work a hundred times harder to atone for my crimes through meritorious service. To repeat: I am grateful to Chairman Mao for giving me light, and I will definitely work hard to reform myself in the future and be determined to follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    Finally, I sincerely hope that the corrupt elements who have not yet confessed or have not thoroughly confessed in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, especially the corrupt elements among the engineering personnel, will be determined to unload their burdens and not continue to make mistakes. Facts have proven that only through thorough confession can one reduce one's guilt. The People's Government's lenient policy has pointed out a bright road for us. The government's leniency towards me is an ironclad fact. I hope you will quickly confess your crimes and strive to atone for your crimes through meritorious service. The confession period is only ten days away, you must not hesitate any longer, do not miss this last opportunity.

### 反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动挽救了我

    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动挽救了我
    夏茂如
    编者按：夏茂如是在二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会上被审判的大贪污犯之一。他因为自动彻底坦白并立功赎罪而被免予刑事处分。下面是他被释放后所写的感想。
    我是一个建筑工程师，解放以前，曾在旧社会干过十六年的建筑事务，解放后，我参加了革命工作。因为我是从旧社会里带着满身污垢走到新社会里来的，因而参加工作后不到五个月，就干起违法乱纪的勾当，最后成了盗窃国家资财一亿二千多万元的大贪污犯。感谢人民政府、感谢毛主席领导的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，把我从绝路上拉回来，使我得以重生。
    我在一九五○年二月参加华东区粮食管理局工作。当我被派到皖北粮食局进行仓库工程修建时，就有在工程中捞一把的思想，事实上后来也这样做了；并且由单独贪污发展到和同去的工程人员进行集体的大贪污。及至营造厂商向我进行种种要挟、要我在工程中给予特殊优待时，我才开始感到恐惧和不安。为了避免露出马脚来，于是要求调动工作，希望以转移地区的办法，来掩盖贪污的罪行，来消除内心的恐惧和不安，但是事实却完全与此相反，调到中南区粮食管理局工作后，接连地听到皖北粮食仓库因营造厂商的偷工减料而发生了下沉、裂缝等问题，这样我的思想负担便一天重似一天。我害怕我的罪行会被人发觉，因而吃不下饭，也睡不好觉，在思想斗争最激烈的时候，我曾想到匿名逃跑，也想到自杀，也想到把贪污的款项捐作抗美援朝。可是，这些想法都不曾使我思想上的沉重包袱有丝毫减轻，我依旧被恐惧的思想压制着。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大运动开始时，我奉派来北京粮食管理总局参加仓库设计工作。这时我更加惶惶不安，坦白呢？还是不坦白呢？这两个问题一直缠绕着我。起初我觉得这两条路都是死路，我觉得我是没有出路的了，及至听到了首长们的苦口婆心地动员报告，知道了自动坦白者可以减轻罪行时，我的坦白和不坦白的思想斗争更加激烈，最后我决心选择坦白的道路，放下沉重的思想包袱。我向领导方面坦白了全部贪污事实。在运动中，经过领导方面多次的鼓励多次的启发和教育，使我认识到我的贪污行为的严重危害性，觉得像我这样的贪污分子，是应该受到法律的严厉制裁的；同时我也认识到必须响应领导上的号召，把我所知道的大贪污犯和几家盗窃国家资财的营造厂一一检举，以求立功赎罪。但是关于我的处分问题，只知道“自动坦白者可从轻处理”，“立功可以赎罪”，至于究竟减轻到什么程度，我总是抱着怀疑的态度，放心不下。我曾经这样想：我的罪行是严重的，减轻罪行，也得判处十年以上的徒刑；但我已是四十一岁的年纪了，如果徒刑十年，一切都完了。但是这些顾虑终于在二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会以后一扫而空了。
    现在我已认识到领导方面和同志们在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中给我的帮助完全是为了拯救我，证明人民政府对于自动坦白悔过并能检举立功的贪污分子，采取从轻论处的政策是一定兑现的。现在我已开始脱胎换骨重新做人了，人民政府对我这样一个严重的大贪污犯还免予刑事处分，给予自新之路，使我感激零涕。毛主席和人民政府对于我的宽大，我永远也不会忘记。我现在才认识到两种截然不同的国家工作人员：一种是忠心耿耿，为人民服务的人员；另一种是自私自利钻进政府机关盗窃国家资财的人员。昨天的夏茂如就属于后一种人员——最可耻的贪污分子。我深感自己过去的罪恶太大了，给国家造成的损失也太大了，今后决心痛改前非，重新做人。我要彻底抛弃技术人员的臭架子，进行思想改造，努力提高自己的政治水平，加百倍地努力工作，以求戴罪立功。重复一句：我感谢毛主席给我的光明，今后一定努力改造自己，下决心跟着毛主席和共产党走。
    最后我诚恳地希望在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中尚未坦白或未彻底坦白的贪污分子，特别是工程人员中的贪污分子，下决心卸掉自己的包袱，不要继续错误下去。事实证明：只有彻底坦白，才能减轻自己的罪过，人民政府的宽大政策已给我们指出了一条光明大道，政府对我的宽大，就是铁的事实。希望你们迅速坦白自己的罪行，争取立功赎罪。坦白期限只有十几天了，你们不能再迟疑下去，不要错过这个最后的机会。
