    Saying it was to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Doing Treasonous Deeds to Help the Enemy
    — A Record of the Crimes of Beijing Clothing Industry Traitorous Merchant Shi Minwen
    Li Weiguang
    Traitorous merchant Shi Minwen is the manager of Beijing Dazhong Clothing and Leather Goods Factory. In the past year alone, he dragged thirty-one cadres of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army into the water, causing losses to the state amounting to 1.1 billion yuan in shoddy workmanship alone.
    All of Shi Minwen's transactions in 1951 were with the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army. In each processing order, he took advantage of the urgency of military supplies and lax inspection to steal large amounts of state assets. For example, in March of last year, when undertaking the production of camouflage nets for the Korean battlefield, the original plan was to use 70,000 jin of hemp, but he stole and reduced it by 12,000 jin; but he was still not satisfied, and used inferior hemp to replace good hemp, wet hemp to replace dry hemp, and inflated prices to carry out large-scale theft. The total amount of this order was 650 million yuan, and he stole and cut corners to the tune of 180 million yuan. According to the factory's deputy manager, Gao Zengjin, the hemp rope used for this batch of camouflage nets was uneven in thickness, and some of the originally planned three-strand rope became one-strand rope during production, making it neither strong nor durable, and reducing the camouflage effect. For another example, when rushing to produce artillery vehicle harnesses for the purpose of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea in April of last year, the leather materials used were mostly inferior leather, white leather, and oily leather, and these bad leathers were stretched, resulting in them becoming soft as cotton wool when exposed to rain, and being of different lengths; after being exposed to the sun, they would shrink greatly. Coupled with rough sewing, either seams would open or threads would break. The harnesses were originally supposed to last a year, but now they could only be used for a few months. What is even more intolerable is that in May of last year, when Shi committed the crime of making the first batch of gun covers for the Volunteer Army, the processing fee was only 8 million yuan, but he took advantage of the loopholes of military urgency and no inspection, stole nine pieces of tarpaulin, used bad thread and inferior leather, and at the same time reduced wages and worked overtime in the name of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea, so that the total value of the theft exceeded the processing fee, reaching 9 million yuan.
    In the processing of leather goods for the People's Liberation Army, Shi Minwen also stole and cut corners without any scruples. He used bad leather such as front-cut leather, edge leather, and cowhide to replace good leather. Workers angrily said: "This is not leather, it's simply meat!" He reduced the width of the grenade launcher belt by one-half of what was originally specified; the machine gun shoulder pads he made could not cover the shoulders and back at all, so that 70 percent of the orders were unqualified and could not be used, and were piled up in warehouses as waste products. In this way, he stole 320 million yuan out of 780 million yuan in transactions; the amount of theft accounted for 40 percent of the transaction amount, which is truly appalling. The other processing orders for the People's Liberation Army that Shi committed to also involved similar thefts. Due to the theft of large amounts of state and people's property, Shi Minwen has leapt from a small businessman with only 200,000 yuan in capital in 1949 to a nouveau riche with more than 1 billion yuan now.
    Shi Minwen's despicable and shameless criminal activities directly undermined the cause of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea and national defense construction. Although Shi Minwen donated 10.46 million yuan to Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea last year, the illegal profits he obtained from shoddy workmanship amounted to 1.1 billion yuan, plus tax evasion of 20 million yuan and tax arrears of more than 79 million yuan, Shi Minwen's illegal income reached 1.2 billion yuan.
    It can be seen from this that the traitorous merchant Shi Minwen not only did not participate in the ranks of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea, but seriously undermined the sacred cause of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea and consolidating national defense. The factory's deputy manager, Gao Zengjin, confessed to their crimes in this way: "After the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea began, our business gradually increased. We pretended to be active and signed patriotic pacts, saying that we would 'contribute all our strength to support the Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea,' but in our hearts we thought that the opportunity to make money had arrived. Therefore, in undertaking orders, we tried our best to steal and cut corners. We knew long ago that some of these things would not be durable after being shipped to Korea, and some would be completely unusable; but for the sake of money, we couldn't care about these things."
    Shi Minwen's shameless theft crimes did not stop there, but what is even more abhorrent is that while stealing a large amount of state property, he also used fraudulent methods to deceive the people's honor for a time. In March of last year, when Shi committed the crime of rushing to produce camouflage nets for the Volunteer Army, he blatantly bribed cadres and openly stole and cut corners, while at the same time spreading rumors that he was losing 80 million yuan, and said with sweet words: "It doesn't matter if we 'lose' a little for the sake of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea." After these shameless deceptions, Shi Minwen obtained a pennant and a letter of condolence from a certain department. From then on, he had "political capital" and boasted about this "glory" everywhere in order to swindle and deceive people and solicit business. When the inspection team of the Beijing Municipal Inspection of Illegal Industrial and Commercial Households arrived at his house, he pointed to the banner and said shamelessly: "We have also contributed to Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea." When the inspection team asked him to confess his crimes, he instead played tricks and resolutely resisted, until the evidence was conclusive and the "offensive and defensive alliance" was smashed, and he could not deny it, did he reluctantly admit the above facts.
    In order to severely punish this traitorous merchant who endangers the interests of the country and the nation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government arrested Shi Minwen on February 17. This traitorous merchant who aids the enemy must be punished justly.

    说的是抗美援朝，作的是叛国助敌
    ——记北京服装业奸商史敏问的罪行
    李维光
    奸商史敏问是北京大众被服皮件厂的经理。仅在去年一年中，就把中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的三十一个干部拖下水去，而给国家造成的损失，仅偷工减料一项即达十一亿元。
    史犯敏问在一九五一年的全部交易，都是和志愿军、解放军进行的。他在每一次加工定货中，都乘军需紧急、验收疏忽，大量偷窃国家资财。比如去年三月在承制朝鲜战地所用的伪装网时，原定用麻七万斤，他却偷减了一万二千斤；但他仍不满足，又用次麻顶好麻，溼麻顶干麻，高报货价，进行大量盗窃。这次定货总额六亿五千万元，他就偷工减料达一亿八千万元。据该厂副理高增缙供称：这批伪装网所用的麻绳，粗细不匀，而且原定的三股线，在制作中有的却变成了一股线，因而既不坚固耐用，更减少了伪装的作用。再如去年四月赶制抗美援朝所用的炮车輓具时，所用皮料，多是次皮、白皮和油皮，并把这些坏皮拉长，结果遇雨即松软如絮，七长八短，日晒后又大大紧缩。再加缝工粗糙，不是开缝就是断线。輓具本来该用一年，现在却只能使用几个月。更令人不能容忍的是去年五月史犯在给志愿军做第一批炮套时，加工费仅八百万元，而他却钻了军用紧急、没有查验的空子，偷窃了盖布九块，并使用了坏线、次皮，同时借抗美援朝之名，降低工资，加班加点，以致偷窃的总值竟超过加工费，而达到九百万元。
    史犯敏问在承制解放军的皮件中，同样肆无忌惮地偷工减料。他用前截皮、边皮、牛头皮等坏皮来顶替好皮，工人气愤地说：“这那里是皮，简直是肉！”他把原规定的掷弹筒带的宽度缩减了二分之
    一；他做的机枪垫肩根本遮不过膀背，以致现有百分之七十的定货，都因不合规格，不能使用，而堆在仓库成了废品。这样，他就在七亿八千万元的交易中，盗窃了三亿二千万元；偷盗数占交易额的百分之四十，这真是骇人听闻的事。史犯所包揽的解放军的另外一些加工定货，也无不照样盗窃。由于盗窃了国家和人民的大量资财，史犯已由一九四九年的仅有二十万元资金的小商人，一跃而为现在拥有十数亿元的暴发户了。
    史犯敏问这种卑鄙无耻的罪恶活动，直接破坏了抗美援朝和国防建设事业。虽然史犯在去年曾缴纳抗美援朝的捐献一千零四十六万元，但他偷工减料所得的非法暴利却达到十一亿元，再加偷漏税两千万元，拖欠税款七千九百多万元，史犯的非法收入便达到十二亿元。
    由此可见，奸商史敏问不但没有参加到抗美援朝的行列中来，反而严重地破坏了抗美援朝和巩固国防的神圣事业。该厂副理高增缙对于他们自己的罪行这样供认说：“抗美援朝运动开始后，我们的生意逐渐加多了。我们曾假装积极地订立了爱国公约，说什么‘贡献一切力量，支援抗美援朝的志愿军’，但心里却认为发财赚钱的机会到了。因而在承制定货中，尽量地偷工减料。我们早就知道，这些东西运到朝鲜后，有的不耐用，有的根本不能用；但我们为了钱，就不能管这些个了。”
    史犯敏问无耻的盗窃罪行还不仅于此，更可恶的是他在大量盗窃了国家财产的同时，还用欺诈的方法一度骗取了人民的荣誉。去年三月史犯在赶制志愿军伪装网时，一面大肆贿赂干部，明目张胆地偷工减料，一面又扬言赔钱八千万元，并花言巧语地说：“为了抗美援朝‘亏’一点也没有关系。”史犯经过这些无耻的吹骗之后，就骗得了某部的奖旗一面，慰问信一封。从此他就有了“政治资本”，到处夸耀这个“光荣”，借以招摇撞骗，兜揽生意。当北京市检查不法工商户的检查小组到达他的房子时，他还指着锦旗厚颜无耻地说：“抗美援朝我们也算出了力。”检查小组要他坦白他的罪行时，他反而玩弄阴谋，坚决对抗，直到证据确凿，“攻守同盟”也被粉碎，无法抵赖时，他才被迫地承认了以上的事实。
    为了严惩这个危害国家民族利益的奸商，北京市人民政府已于二月十七日把史犯敏问逮捕起来。这个叛国助敌的奸商，必须受到正义的惩罚。
