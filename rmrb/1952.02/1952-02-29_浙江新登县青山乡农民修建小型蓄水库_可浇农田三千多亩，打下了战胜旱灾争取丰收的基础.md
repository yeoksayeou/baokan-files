Farmers in Qingshan Township, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, under the leadership of the People's Government, took advantage of the slack farming season last winter to build a small reservoir. The reservoir covers an area of 27.7 mu and is estimated to have a water storage capacity sufficient to irrigate 3,062 mu of farmland (including 1,800 mu of farmland benefiting from outside the township). This solves the problem of drought that has never been solved in the history of this township, laying a favorable foundation for increasing the unit area yield and striving for a bumper harvest in the future.

This township has a total of four villages, with 3,806 mu of farmland, of which more than 1,200 mu are frequently affected by drought. Before liberation, most farmers rented land from landlords, and in years of severe drought, the rice they harvested was not enough to pay rent to the landlords. For example, Ying Chuan'gen from Qingquan Village used to rent 11.5 mu of land from a landlord. One year, due to drought, he only harvested 1,250 jin of rice, but he had to pay 1,500 jin in rent, leaving him 250 jin short. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the farmers carried out land reform and were allotted land, so they no longer had to pay rent to landlords. Last year, under the leadership of the People's Government, they achieved a bumper harvest through the drought resistance movement, but some fields still suffered reduced yields due to drought. Therefore, the farmers urgently demand to overcome drought.

After the autumn harvest last year, farmers in this township, under the leadership of the township government, increased their understanding of the importance of water conservancy through celebrating the bumper harvest and recalling the suffering from drought in previous years. Subsequently, the township held township cadre meetings, activist meetings, and old farmer symposiums to discuss and study the issue of water conservancy construction. As a result, it was decided to build a small reservoir in Guanshan Village, and the area of the reservoir and the required labor and tools were planned. After the plan for building the reservoir was determined, some people initially believed that the construction project was huge and the funding was difficult, and they were afraid that the project would be suspended halfway, wasting labor and leaving the land barren. After discovering this idea, the township cadres overcame it by carrying out patriotic education, leading the masses to recall the arduous situation of drought resistance work in the past, and pointing out the long-term benefits of building the reservoir. The masses of farmers incorporated the task of doing a good job in building the reservoir into the patriotic pact, ensuring that they would resolutely complete the reservoir construction project. At this time, the township government led the masses to discuss the organization of manpower and the solution of funding and tools. The township established a water conservancy committee, mobilized 450 people, and formed a labor team. At the same time, the farmers voluntarily took out 1,000 dan of lime, and borrowed 15 million yuan from the People's Government, solving the material and funding difficulties in building the reservoir.

After the construction of the reservoir officially started on November 20 last year, in addition to the labor team, all men, women, old and young who could work participated in the work, truly turning the winter slack into winter busy. For example, Lou Liangmu, a 52-year-old man, carried mud and stones when the weather was sunny, and wove soil baskets when it rained. Lou Aifeng, a 55-year-old woman from Qingquan Village, carried soil during the day and made straw sandals at night for those who carried stones to wear. The farmers participating in the labor team worked even harder. They put forward the slogan: "Making a reservoir is like building a granary, carrying soil is like carrying grain." They carried soil all day long, and lit gas lamps to work for three hours at night before resting. The township cadres were even busier. They moved to the edge of the reservoir to live after the construction started. Farmers from seven nearby townships also organized eight teams with a total of 2,850 people, bringing their own luggage, food, and tools to Qingshan Township to help. In this way, the reservoir project, which was originally planned to be completed in six months, was completed in 46 days. At the same time, because the work efficiency was improved, a lot of manpower and funding were saved. For example, the original plan required 50,000 workdays and 350 jin of gunpowder (for blasting stones), but more than 13,000 workdays and 260 jin of gunpowder were saved.

After the reservoir was built, it began to break the feudal superstitious idea of relying on heaven for food among the farmers in this township, and strengthened the farmers' confidence in overcoming drought and striving for a bumper harvest. For example, Lou Jinyuan, a 69-year-old farmer, initially had little confidence in building water conservancy to prevent drought. After the reservoir was built, he said happily: "I will never believe in heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods again. It is right to listen to the Communist Party." Lou Aifeng also said: "Building a reservoir is like building a granary, and we can have a bumper harvest every year in the future." Now, under the leadership of the township people's government, all the farmers in the township are actively preparing for spring plowing and large-scale production.

    浙江新登县青山乡农民修建小型蓄水库
    可浇农田三千多亩，打下了战胜旱灾争取丰收的基础
    浙江省新登县青山乡农民，去年冬季在人民政府领导下，趁农闲时间修建了一个小型蓄水库；水库面积共占地二十七亩七分，估计蓄水量可浇灌农田三千零六十二亩（内有外乡受益田一千八百亩），解决了这个乡历史上从来没有解决的旱灾问题，给今后提高单位面积产量和争取丰收打下了有利的基础。
    这个乡共有四个村，有田三千八百零六亩，其中有一千二百多亩经常受旱。解放前，大部农民租种地主土地，遇到旱灾严重的年成，所收稻谷还不够给地主交租子。如清泉村应传根过去租种了地主十一亩五分田，有一年遭旱灾只收了一千二百五十斤稻谷，但他要缴的租谷就有一千五百斤，还差二百五十斤。解放后，农民在共产党领导下实行了土地改革，分得了土地，已经再不要给地主交租子了。去年在人民政府领导下经过抗旱运动又获得了丰收，可是仍有一部分田受旱减产。因此，农民迫切要求战胜旱灾。
    去年秋收后，这个乡的农民在乡政府领导下，通过庆祝丰收和回忆往年受旱灾的痛苦，提高了对兴修水利的认识。接着全乡召开了乡干部会、积极分子会、老农座谈会等，讨论研究兴修水利的问题，结果决定在官山村修建一个小型蓄水库，并计划了水库的面积和需用的人工、工具等。修建水库的计划确定后，开始有一部分群众认为修建工程浩大，经费困难，害怕修到半路停工，既浪费人工，又荒芜田地。乡干部发现这种思想后，就通过进行爱国主义教育，领导群众回忆过去抗旱工作的艰苦情况，并指出修好水库后的长远利益，克服了这种思想。农民群众把做好修建水库工作订在爱国公约上，保证要坚决完成修建水库的工程。这时乡政府就领导群众讨论了组织人力和解决经费、工具等问题。全乡成立了水利委员会，动员了四百五十人，组成了一个民工大队；同时农民自动拿出了一千担石灰，又从人民政府贷款一千五百万元，解决了修建水库的材料和经费困难。
    去年十一月二十日修建水库的工程正式开始后，除民工大队外，全乡凡是能劳动的男女老幼都参加了工作，真正把冬闲变成了冬忙。如五十二岁的楼良木老汉，天晴时抬泥挑石头，下雨时编挑土筐子；清泉村五十五岁的楼阿凤老大娘，白天抬土，夜里还打草鞋送给抬石头的人穿。参加民工大队的农民工作劲头更大，他们提出：“做水库好比建仓，挑土就是挑谷”的口号，白天抬一天土，夜里还点着汽灯干三个钟头才休息。乡干部更是忙，他们从开工后就搬到水库边上住。附近七个乡的农民也组织了八个大队共二千八百五十多人，自带行李、伙食、工具到青山乡来帮忙。这样原计划六个月完成的水库工程，在四十六天内就完成了。同时因为工作效率提高，还节省了许多人工和经费。如原计划需要五万个工和三百五十斤火药（炸石头用），做下来就节省了一万三千多个工和二百六十斤火药。
    水库修成后，开始打破了这乡农民的封建迷信靠天吃饭的思想，坚定了农民战胜旱灾争取丰收的信心。如六十九岁的老农民楼金元，最初对兴修水利预防旱灾的信心不大；水库修成后，他高兴地说：“今后再也不迷信天地鬼神了，听共产党的话没错。”楼阿凤也说：“修成了水库，等于修了个谷仓，今后可以年年丰收了。”现在全乡农民正在乡人民政府的领导下积极准备春耕大生产。
