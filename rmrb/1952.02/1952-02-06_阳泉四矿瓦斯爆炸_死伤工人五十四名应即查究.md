    Yangquan Fourth Mine Gas Explosion
    Death and Injury of Fifty-Four Workers Should Be Investigated Immediately
    Editor: A serious gas explosion accident occurred in the state-owned Yangquan Fourth Mine in Shanxi Province on the evening of January 8th, killing and injuring 54 workers, including 13 deaths, 8 serious injuries, and 33 minor injuries. Afterwards, the relevant departments such as the Yangquan Mining Bureau and the Yangquan Mining Area Federation of Trade Unions jointly formed an inspection team to investigate the cause of the accident. The Party, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League cadres of this mine are also carrying out the work of comforting the injured workers and settling the deceased. We hope that the higher authorities will immediately send personnel to inspect and investigate responsibility in order to avoid similar accidents from happening again.

    Editor's note: This newspaper has been constantly receiving letters about mine accidents, which shows that this problem is still very serious. We hope that the relevant leading organs will pay great attention to this issue and assist various mines to thoroughly investigate and solve it as soon as possible.
