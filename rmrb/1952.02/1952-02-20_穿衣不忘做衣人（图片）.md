    Wearing Clothes, Don't Forget the Clothing Makers (Sketch from the Korean Battlefield, Part 5)
    Shao Yu
    In September of last year, when the weather in Korea was just starting to turn cool, the volunteer soldiers' cotton-padded clothing was transported to the front lines in Korea. In each set of cotton-padded clothing bags, there were sewing kits, first-aid kits, triangular bandages, insecticide, and comfort bags and letters from the people of the motherland, as well as various gifts that the clothing workers themselves had packed inside. When the soldiers read the letters of sympathy and put on the clothes, their feelings of love for the motherland and the people of the motherland were expressed in a quick-rhythm poem:
    New cotton-padded clothes, padded pants, three layers,
    Altogether weighing seven or eight *jin*;
    Made for us by the people of the motherland,
    Sent to the most beloved people.
    We put them on,
    Warm and comfortable, really great,
    Not afraid of climbing mountains or lying in the snow,
    Bravely and tenaciously kill the enemy!
    When drinking water, think of its source,
    Wearing clothes, don't forget the clothing makers.

    穿衣不忘做衣人（朝鲜战场素描之五）
    邵宇
    去年九月，朝鲜的天气刚刚有些凉意，志愿军的棉衣便运到了朝鲜前线。在每套棉衣的袋子里，有针线包、救急包、三角巾、杀虫药和祖国人民的慰问袋、慰问信，以及缝衣工人自己装进去的各种礼物。当战士们看慰问信和穿衣服的时候，他们那种热爱祖国和祖国人民的心情，洋溢在一首快板诗中：
    棉衣棉裤三层新，
    统共足有七、八斤；
    祖国人民把他做，
    送给最可爱的人。
    咱们把它穿起来，
    暖暖和和多得劲，
    爬山卧雪都不怕，
    英勇顽强杀敌人！
    饮水更要先思源，
    穿衣不忘做衣人。
