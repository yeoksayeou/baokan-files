Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 28th: Lee Kyung-hee, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, and Kim Ki-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, issued statements on February 27th, respectively, protesting the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in spreading massive amounts of bacteria and poisonous insects.

Lee Kyung-hee said: The enemy's inhuman atrocities have aroused the anger of all Korean women. We will never be intimidated by any of the enemy's atrocities, and we will launch an even more resolute struggle. Progressive people and kind women all over the world support our struggle. We believe that under the condemnation of the people of the world, the American armed interventionists will not be able to escape the judgment of justice. Its adventurous act of using bacteriological weapons will not save it from failure, but will only accelerate its demise.

In his statement, Kim Ki-soo sternly denounced the aggressors for using captured Korean youths as test subjects for bacteriological weapons and for colluding with Japanese bacterial warfare criminals to carry out the heinous crime of bacteriological warfare. Kim Ki-soo, on behalf of all Korean youths, resolutely demanded that the perpetrators of bacteriological warfare be held accountable, and vowed to respond to the American aggressors with even heavier blows.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 28th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article condemning the crimes of the U.S. military in Korea for using bacteriological weapons, saying: "The American aggressors in Korea, in addition to the many serious crimes they have already committed, have now added new barbaric and bestial acts, which expose the shameful and degenerate nature of the imperialists." The newspaper said: "This unprecedentedly barbaric act of attempting to slaughter the Korean people is more excessive than the most heinous crimes of the Hitler gang. This barbaric act is directed against all of humanity, and the imperialists are preparing the same fate for all of humanity." The newspaper concluded: "The imperialists want to intimidate the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers and weaken their will to fight to victory. But they have miscalculated. The use of bacteriological weapons, like the bestial massacre of prisoners of war on Koje Island, only arouses deeper hatred for the aggressors and indignation from world public opinion."

The Austrian "People's Voice" newspaper published a commentary on February 23rd, denouncing the bloody incident of the large-scale massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island by the United States. The newspaper also wrote: This incident shows what the true meaning of "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war—a major demand of the U.S. side in the Korean armistice negotiations—is.

    抗议美国侵略者撒布细菌的万恶罪行
    波兰奥地利报纸指出：美国暴行引起全世界舆论的愤慨
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会副委员长李敬姬、朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会副委员长金基洙，在二十七日分别发表谈话，抗议美国侵略者大量撒布细菌毒虫的万恶罪行。
    李敬姬说：敌人这种绝灭人性的暴行，激起了我们全朝鲜妇女的愤怒。我们绝不是敌人的任何暴行所能吓倒的，我们要展开更加坚决的斗争。全世界进步人民和善良的妇女们都支持我们的斗争。我们相信，在全世界人民的声讨下，美国武装干涉者决不能逃脱正义的裁判。它使用细菌武器的冒险行动绝不能挽救它的失败，而只能使它自己加速走向最后的灭亡。
    金基洙在谈话中严词斥责侵略者把被俘掳的朝鲜青年当做细菌武器的试验对象、并勾结日本细菌战犯进行细菌战争的滔天罪行，金基洙代表全朝鲜青年坚决主张追究细菌战争罪犯的责任，誓以更加沉重的打击来回答美国侵略者。
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章谴责侵朝美军使用细菌武器的罪行说：“在朝鲜的美国侵略者除了已犯的许多重大罪行外，现在又添上了新的野蛮和兽性的行为，这种行为暴露了帝国主义者的可耻和堕落。”该报说：“这种企图屠杀朝鲜人民的史无先例的野蛮行为，比希特勒匪帮的最凶恶的罪行有过之而无不及。这种野蛮行为是对付整个人类的，帝国主义者正在为整个人类准备同样的命运。”该报结语说：“帝国主义者是想要吓倒朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，削弱他们战斗到胜利的意志。但是他们的算盘打错了。使用细菌武器，正像兽性屠杀巨济岛上的战俘一样，只有引起人们对侵略者的更深的仇恨和全世界舆论的愤慨。”
    “奥地利人民之声”报于二月二十三日发表评论，痛斥美国大规模屠杀巨济岛上的朝中战俘的血腥事件。该报并写道：这一事件说明了“自愿遣返”战俘——美方在朝鲜停战谈判中的一项主要要求——的真正意义是什么。
