    Luo Huichun's Embezzlement Case Awakened Me

    Editor: The news published in the paper about Luo Huichun, the Deputy Manager of the State-Owned Pharmaceutical Company and Manager of the Northeast Pharmaceutical Company, who, due to his greed for personal enjoyment and inability to withstand the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, completely lost his revolutionary stance and became an embezzler stealing state property, has aroused my high vigilance.

    I met Luo Huichun as early as 1942, when we studied together at the Yan'an Border Region Pharmaceutical School. But we hadn't seen each other for seven or eight years after that. It wasn't until he came to Beijing for recuperation last July that I met him again. When I saw him, I felt that he was very lavish and generous. He treated me to dinner and said, "I don't care about money. I'm talking about hundreds of millions, billions at a time. The higher-ups trust me very much. They gave me several thousand billion (Northeast currency) to run the pharmaceutical company well, and the responsibility is great!" He also said that he would be going to Tianjin soon and had already asked his subordinates in Tianjin to find him the best house and buy some good furniture, etc. At the time, I didn't mind, I just asked, "Using public money to buy?" He said, "The higher-ups have given me such a big responsibility, what do these trivial matters of life count for!" Hearing this, I thought he was really capable and resourceful, and that "it's right to enjoy some things," and I didn't further investigate or expose his corrupt lifestyle and embezzlement. On the contrary, I was blinded by his words. Before he left, he asked me to work for him, saying that he wanted me to be the director (according to him, he was going to establish a sanatorium for pharmaceutical company employees); I replied, "As long as you can do it, I am definitely willing." He said, "As long as I mention it to the heads of the Ministry of Health, I can be transferred."

    I admire others who have economic power and enjoy a good life, which is enough to show that I have begun to be eroded by bourgeois ideology, and this is extremely dangerous. I don't have much power now, nor do I manage money, but if I don't ideologically draw a clear line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, I am very likely to follow Luo Huichun's path if I have the opportunity! Luo Huichun's case has given me a serious lesson. I must be more vigilant in the future and constantly examine and criticize my own bourgeois thoughts.

### 罗惠春的贪污事件警醒了我

    罗惠春的贪污事件警醒了我
    编辑同志：报上登载的国营医药公司副经理兼东北区医药公司经理罗惠春因贪图个人享受，经不起资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，完全丧失革命立场，变成了盗窃国家财产的贪污犯的事实，引起了我高度的警惕。
    早在一九四二年我便和罗惠春相识，那时我们一起在延安边区医药学校学习。但后来我们有七八年没见过面。直到去年七月间他来北京休养，我才和他见了面。当我见到他时，我感到他很阔绰大方。他招待我吃饭，并说：“钱我是不在乎的，一开口就是几亿、几十亿，上级很信任我；拿几千亿（东北币）叫我办好医药公司，责任很大！”他还说不久要到天津去，现在先叫下级到天津给他找顶好的房子，买些好家具等等。当时我并不介意，只是问：“用公家钱买？”他说：“上级这样大的责任让我担任，这点生活小事算什么！”我听了，就以为他真能干，有办法，“享受一些也是应当的”，没有进一步去追查、揭发他这种腐化生活和贪污行为。相反地，我却被他这种言词迷蒙住了。他临走时叫我到他那里工作，说是叫我当院长（据他说要成立医药公司职工疗养院）；我就回答：“只要你能办到，我一定愿意。”他说：“只要我给卫生部首长一提，就可调动。”
    我羡慕别人掌握经济大权，生活享受得好，这足以说明我已开始被资产阶级的思想所侵蚀，这是极端危险的。我现在职权不大，也没有管钱，但如果不从思想上划清无产阶级和资产阶级之间的界限，一有机会，我就很可能走罗惠春的路！罗惠春的事件给了我一个严重的教训，我今后必须提高警惕，随时检查和批判自己的资产阶级思想。
