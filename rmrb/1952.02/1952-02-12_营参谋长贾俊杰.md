    Battalion Chief of Staff Jia Junjie
    Comrade Jia Junjie is the Chief of Staff of a battalion in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. During the operation to smash the enemy's "Autumn Offensive," he coordinated with the First Company to defend the 938.2 Height on the east bank of the Han River, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy for five days and four nights, creating a glorious example of a blocking battle.
    At 3:00 PM on October 15th, the enemy began to attack the 938.2 Height, and fierce fighting broke out across the board. At this time, Comrade Jia Junjie proposed the slogan of the battalion creating a "Steel Battalion" and the First Company striving for "Hero Company." During the course of the battle, Comrade Jia Junjie personally observed the terrain and organized firepower with the company commander, and frequently went to various positions to listen to the opinions of the soldiers and study the battle situation. Whenever the situation was critical, Jia Junjie stepped forward and fought alongside the soldiers to counterattack the enemy. On one occasion, the left-wing position was occupied by the enemy, so he personally organized the bugler, telephone operator, and others to counterattack the enemy and regain the position. Jia Junjie's exemplary actions constantly boosted the morale of the soldiers, filled them with confidence in victory, and demonstrated unparalleled heroism and tenacity. When the fortifications were destroyed by enemy fire, new fortifications were built in the shell craters; when some soldiers' right hands were injured, they used their left hands to throw grenades and shoot; when the bullets ran out, they used iron shovels, picks, and finally stones to fight, not allowing the enemy to occupy an inch of land.
    On the last day of the battle, Jia Junjie's left hand was wounded twice, and his middle finger was broken, but he still held the position with all the soldiers of the company. In this blocking battle, the First Company repelled more than a hundred enemy assaults and annihilated more than 1,800 enemies. Jia Junjie and the First Company were both awarded the first-class merit in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. (Attached image)

    营参谋长贾俊杰
    贾俊杰同志是志愿军某部一营参谋长，在粉碎敌人“秋季攻势”作战中，他协同第一连坚守在汉江东岸的九三八·二高地上，和敌人激战五天四夜，创造了阻击战的光辉战例。
    十月十五日下午三时，敌人开始向九三八·二高地进攻了，激烈的战斗全面展开。这时贾俊杰同志提出一营创造“钢铁营”，一连争取“英雄连”的口号。在战斗的进行中，贾俊杰同志亲自和连长观察地形，组织火力，并经常到各个阵地上去听取战士的意见，研究战斗情况。每当情势危急时，贾俊杰便挺身而出，和战士们一起去反击敌人。有一次，左翼阵地被敌人占领了，他便亲自将司号员、电话员等组织起来，去反击敌人，夺回了阵地。贾俊杰的模范行动，经常鼓舞着战士们的战斗情绪，使他们充满着胜利的信心，表现了无比的英勇和顽强。工事被敌人的炮火摧毁了，就借着弹坑又修起了新的工事；有的战士的右手负伤了，便用左手去投弹射击；子弹打光了，就用铁锨打，用洋镐打，最后用石头打，不让敌人占领一寸土地。
    战斗的最后一天，贾俊杰的左手两次负伤，中指被打断了，但是他仍然和全连的战士们坚守着阵地。在这次阻击战中，一连击退敌人百余次冲锋，歼灭敌人一千八百余名，贾俊杰和第一连都光荣地立了抗美援朝一级功。（附图片）
