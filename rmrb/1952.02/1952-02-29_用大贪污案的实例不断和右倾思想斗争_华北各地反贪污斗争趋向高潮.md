A fierce anti-corruption struggle is being widely carried out in the leading organs at the provincial, special district, and county levels in the North China region. The battles in various places generally began in early February, with the organs above the provincial and municipal levels starting in January. Most leading cadres first conducted self-examinations, cleansed themselves, and then entered the battle in a planned and step-by-step manner. Therefore, the struggle showed an orderly lineup and fierce combat from the beginning. So far, three different situations have basically emerged in various units throughout the region: The first is that the "tiger hunt" is nearing its end, and the main "tigers" have been captured. The main tasks of these units now are to clean up the battlefield, track down any escaped major corrupt elements, organize special institutions to investigate major corruption cases, and carry out screening, verification, and recovery of stolen goods. Secondly, they must mobilize the masses to summarize the achievements of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movements, further draw a clear line from the bourgeoisie ideologically, and specifically formulate various systems, including democratic life within the organs and all aspects of medical health and cultural entertainment. Most leading organs at the provincial level in Shanxi and Chahar, as well as some advanced special districts and individual counties, fall into this category. The second is that the "tiger hunt" battle has entered its climax, but the big "tigers" have not been completely captured, and the democratic movement within the organs was not thorough enough in its initial stage. The main task of these units now is to implement the policy of "thoroughly eliminating evil," capturing all large and small "tigers," and striving for leading cadres to conduct democratic make-up lessons at the end of the movement. A few provincial-level organs and most special district-level organs in the region fall into this category. The third is that leading cadres hurriedly entered the "tiger hunt" battle without properly cleansing themselves, so they encountered resistance, and right-leaning thought is still the main obstacle. The main task of these units now is to purify the battle headquarters, continuously strengthen the team, and carry out the battle. Some special district-level organs and most county-level organs fall into this category.

This "tiger hunt" battle, which is still fiercely underway, has brightened the eyes of all those who have participated. At first, some people did not believe that there were "tigers" in their own ranks. "Old colleagues" and "old subordinates" had become obstacles to their correct understanding of this issue. They were not able to recognize that the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets had changed the nature of these "colleagues" and "subordinates." Many people also lacked understanding of the organized offensives launched by agents sent by the bourgeoisie within the revolutionary ranks, thinking that there might be some corruption but it was a "small matter" and did not need to be "alarmed." These erroneous ideas have all been criticized and corrected in the deepening of the movement. The "tiger hunt" battle that is currently being carried out fiercely in various places has fully proven that the "small tigers" discovered at the beginning of the movement have, in many cases, been promoted to "big tigers" in the in-depth investigation and positive struggle. Recently, "tiger dens" have been universally discovered in various places. In Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province, twenty-one "tiger dens" have been dug out so far. Most of these "tiger dens" are hidden in supply and marketing cooperatives, warehouses, grain companies, banks, taxation and other units. Many of the masterminds of the "tiger dens" are agents sent by the bourgeoisie, who have entered the economic departments at all levels in an organized and planned manner to steal state property. All the "tiger dens" that have been discovered have adopted a stubborn attitude towards the movement. But all these stubborn resistances are useless, and in the end, all of them are caught without exception. At present, in the month-long tiger hunt battle, various places have fully realized that: timely attention to new things in the movement, using examples of various major corrupt elements that have been discovered, and continuously launching struggles against right-leaning thought are the decisive key to the victory of the battle. As long as right-leaning thought is overcome, relying on the masses, fully investigating and researching, clarifying the "enemy's situation," and fighting firmly, all the methods of "deception," "fraud," and "resistance" of the major corrupt elements can be smashed.

The common experiences gained in various places are as follows:

1.  There must be a strong and pure "tiger hunt" headquarters. The headquarters must not have members who are not clean or who intentionally or unintentionally harbor corruption and do not completely change their attitude. The headquarters should have an effective office, and the commanders should rely on the office to study and sort out materials at any time, discover advanced experiences at any time, and promote advanced experiences. Pay attention to breaking through backward units and catching up with advanced units at any time.

2.  It is necessary to organize a brave and resourceful "tiger hunt" fighting team. The team must be led by the chief, and the team should generally include backbone members with clear minds, firm positions, and mastery of policies, insiders with a lot of business knowledge and good at investigation, experts with accounting knowledge who can calculate accounts, and corrupt elements who are familiar with corruption techniques and have sincerely confessed and are willing to actively perform meritorious service.

3.  It is necessary to rely on the masses to conduct meticulous investigation and research, which is an important foundation for the victory of the battle. The investigation methods that have been gathered in various places include "twelve investigations" and "ten comparisons." The twelve investigations are: investigate business, investigate relationships (such as transactions with those manufacturers, illegal loans, etc.), investigate goods (knowing that shoddy workmanship is not investigated, purchasing inferior goods from afar, etc.), investigate prices, investigate contracts, investigate accounts, investigate confidentiality, investigate background, history, investigate life, investigate mass reactions, investigate the attitude towards the movement, and investigate investment in private businesses. The ten comparisons are: compare the valuation list with the commercial list, compare the commercial list with the account, compare the contract with the specifications, quantity, and quality of the materials, compare the valuation with the market price at that time, compare the withdrawal and payment time, compare the number and time of grain receipts, compare the expenditure and balance, compare the balance and inventory, compare the time of grain receipt (purchase) and exchange (sale), and compare the grain purchase and sale price with the market price at that time.

4.  "Big tigers" are generally more stubborn, especially "tiger dens," which have an "alliance of life and death" within them, so the battle must be both offensive and strategic. It is necessary to use various opportunities to implement the spirit of the policy. For "tiger dens," most places have adopted the method of "luring the tiger away from the mountain and defeating them one by one."

The more the "tiger hunt" battle tends to climax, the more calm the leader's mind must be. Satisfying with superficial achievements and slackening from the leadership is the most dangerous situation. Anyang in Pingyuan Province proposed that the more victorious the "tiger hunt" is, the more the leadership should go to the front line, start well, and must end well. This spirit has proven to be correct in various places. When the battle reaches a climax, the leadership must remain calm: first, prevent "leftist" deviations in the movement, and correct them immediately if they occur; second, carefully screen the confessed materials, clarify the origins and destinations of various corruption situations, and prevent "tigers" from mixing falsehood with truth and taking the opportunity to counterattack.

    用大贪污案的实例不断和右倾思想斗争
    华北各地反贪污斗争趋向高潮
    猛烈的反贪污斗争正在华北区省、专区、县各级领导机关普遍开展中。各地的战斗一般开始在二月初，省、市以上机关在一月间就已开始。大部分领导干部都首先进行了检查，洗干净自己的手脚才进入战斗，而且都是有计划有步骤地进入战斗的，因此斗争一开始就表现阵容整齐，战斗猛烈。到目前为止，全区各单位基本上出现了三种不同情况：第一种是“打虎”战已近结束，主要“老虎”已就擒。这些单位目前的主要任务首先是打扫战场，追查漏网的大贪污分子，组织专门清理大贪污案件的机构，进行甄别、对证、清赃等工作。其次是发动群众总结反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的成果，进一步从思想上和资产阶级划清界限，具体订立各种制度，包括机关内部的民主生活到医药卫生、文化娱乐等各方面。山西、察哈尔等省级的大部领导机关及部分先进专区、个别县属于这种情况。第二种是“打虎”战斗已进入高潮，但大“老虎”未捉净，机关内部的民主运动在开始阶段也做得不彻底。这些单位目前的主要任务是贯彻“除恶务净”的方针，捉净一切大、小“老虎”，并争取在运动结束时领导干部进行民主补课工作。少数省级机关和全区多数专署级机关属于这种情况。第三种是领导干部没有好好洗澡就匆忙地进入“打虎”战斗，因此遇到了阻力，右倾思想仍是主要障碍。这些单位目前的主要任务是纯洁战斗指挥部，不断加强队伍，进行战斗。部分专署级机关及大部县级机关属于这种情况。
    这一场至今仍在激烈进行着的“打虎”战斗，使所有参加战斗的人眼睛都明亮起来了。起初，有些人不大相信自己的队伍中有“虎”。“老同事”“老部下”曾经成为他们正确认识这个问题的障碍。他们不大能认识资产阶级的糖衣炮弹已使这些“同事”“部下”变了质。不少人对于资产阶级派进来的代理人在革命队伍内部所进行的有组织的进攻也认识不足，以为可能有些贪污但也是“小事”，不用“大惊小怪”。这些错误思想，在运动深入中统统被批判和纠正了。目前各地正在激烈进行着的“打虎”战斗已经完全证明：运动开始时发现的“小虎”，以后在深入调查和正面进行斗争中有不少升为“大虎”，近来各地普遍发现到的是“虎窝”。平原省新乡专区目前掏出的“虎窝”就有二十一个。这些“虎窝”大多隐蔽在供销合作社、仓库、粮食公司、银行、税务等单位。“虎窝”的主谋者有不少是资产阶级派进来的代理人，他们完全是有组织有计划地打入各级的经济部门中盗窃国家财产的。所有已被发现的“虎窝”对于运动都采取了顽抗态度。但这种种顽抗都是没有用的，最后还是一个不剩地全部落网。目前各地已在一个月来的打虎战斗中充分认识到：及时注意运动中的新事物，用已发现的各种大贪污分子的实例，不断和右倾思想展开斗争，是战斗取得胜利的决定关键。只要克服了右倾思想，依靠群众，充分调查研究，查明“敌情”，坚强战斗，大贪污分子的一切“蒙”、“骗”、“抗”的办法，都是可以粉碎的。
    各地已取得的共同经验有以下几点：
    一、要有坚强而纯洁的“打虎”指挥部。指挥部中不能有手面不净或有意无意包庇贪污而又不彻底改变态度的分子。指挥部要有得力的办公室，指挥员要依靠办公室随时研究整理材料，随时发现先进经验，推广先进经验。随时注意突破落后单位，赶上先进单位。
    二、要组织有勇有谋的“打虎”战斗队。这个队伍必须是首长挂帅，队伍中一般应包括头脑清醒、立场稳、掌握政策的骨干分子，业务知识多、善于调查的内行，有会计知识会算账的专家，再配以熟悉贪污法术而已真诚坦白并愿积极立功的贪污分子。
    三、要依靠群众进行精密的调查研究，这是战斗取得胜利的重要基础。调查的方法，各地已集中起来的有“十二查”和“十对”。十二查为：查业务、查关系（如与那些厂商交易、非法借款等）、查货色（偷工减料明知不究、远地购劣货等）、查价格、查合同、查账目、查保密、查出身、历史、查生活、查群众反映、查对运动的态度、查在私商入股。十对为：估价单和商单对，商单和账目对，合同和物资的规格、数量、质量对，估价和当时市价对，取款和付款时间对，领取粮食数目和时间对，支出和结存对，结存和库存对，粮食领（买）和换（卖）的时间对，粮食买卖价格和当时的市价对。
    四、“大虎”一般较顽强，特别是“虎窝”，内部有“生死同盟”，因此战斗时必须是有攻有谋。要运用各种机会，贯彻政策精神。对于“虎窝”，多数地方都采取了“调虎离群，各个击破的方法”。
    “打虎”战斗越是趋向高潮，领导者的头脑就越要冷静。满足于表面成绩，便从领导方面松懈下来的情况是最危险的。平原省安阳提出“打虎”越胜利，领导方面更要亲上前线，开始得好，一定也要结束得好，这种精神在各地都证明是正确的。到战斗高潮中，领导方面的头脑必须冷静：一是防止运动中的“左”倾偏向，发生一件，就要立即纠正一件；一是要认真甄别已坦白的材料，对于各种贪污情况要弄清来路去向，防止“老虎”以假混真，藉口反攻。（据新华社消息）
