    The Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement in the Hengyang Special District Organs Has Not Yet Been Launched

    Editor: Currently, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Hengyang Special District of Hunan Province has not yet been effectively launched. This is mainly because the leaders at the special district level have not achieved "chief officer responsibility, personally taking action." Learning has become a formality, and cadres' thinking is confused. However, according to the materials exposed at the enlarged meeting of the CCP Hengyang Local Committee on January 7, the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the CCP Hengyang Local Committee, the Hengyang Special Commissioner's Office, and its directly affiliated organs are serious.

    First is the forgery of receipts and theft of state property. The Hengyang Special Commissioner's Office Land Reform Committee once forged receipts for construction costs of 31.5 million yuan and printing costs of 5.4 million yuan. The CCP Hengyang Local Committee once forged receipts for vehicle expenses of 20 million yuan, repair costs of 5 million yuan, gasoline expenses of 13 million yuan, and another 20 million yuan for repair costs. Some cadres who were good at forging receipts were actually considered "good cadres." Second is engaging in speculative business, violating national laws. The CCP Hengyang Local Committee organs once withdrew 50 million yuan from the special commissioner's office's local finances and sent Liu Dezhi, the secretary-general of the local committee, to do business. Whether it made or lost money, the government didn't know. The local committee secretary once "borrowed" 420 million yuan from the special commissioner's office's local finances to the sub-district command to run businesses, which has not yet been returned. The special commissioner's office organs once withdrew 200 million yuan from the special district local enterprise company to engage in cotton business, attempting to seize exorbitant profits; and specially sent cadres to Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shenyang and other places to do this. Cui Linbin, a cadre of the special commissioner's office specializing in "production", was once arrested by the Public Security Bureau from another location and sent back for violating the law, but now he is still selling cotton in Shenyang. In addition, arbitrary squandering and extravagant waste are also very serious. When Commissioner Liu Junshi was transferred, he hosted banquets ten times, and the cost of eating and drinking alone amounted to more than 20 million yuan, not including other gifts and movie tickets. The annual expenditure of the local committee organs, in addition to the funds issued by higher authorities, also needs to draw 250 million yuan from "organ production" and local finances to fill the gaps. The extent of waste is astounding!

    From the above situation, the problem in Hengyang Special District is serious, and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement must be launched on a large scale quickly. We suggest that relevant leaders conduct a prompt investigation.
              Han Yusheng Liu Liu Tian Ping

    Editor's Note: Judging from the materials revealed by the readers, the reason why the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Hengyang Special District-level organs has not been launched is mainly because some leading cadres are not clean themselves. Relevant authorities should immediately investigate and deal with this.

    Leading Cadres in Qi County, Shanxi Province, Are Not Clean, Obstructing the Development of the Movement

    Editor: Leading cadres in the county-level organs of Qi County, Shanxi Province, are hindering the development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    At the beginning of the movement, Comrade Li Guicheng, Secretary of the CCP Qi County Committee (formerly the county head, appointed as the county committee secretary in September 1951), confessed his problems a little, but his confession was not thorough, and the masses expressed dissatisfaction. Liu Jitang, the deputy county head (director of the Qi County Thrift Inspection Committee), did not confess his problems at all. On January 21, when a large-scale encirclement and suppression of corrupt elements was launched, all units of the government organs unanimously believed that Xu Chucheng, the director of the Qi County Hospital and concurrently the chief of the Health Section of the County People's Government, and Liu Zhaomin, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the County People's Government, were the main targets of the struggle, but Li Guicheng and Liu Jitang adopted a passive attitude and ignored the opinions of the masses. This is because the corruption of Xu Chucheng and Liu Zhaomin was related to Liu Jitang. Based on the opinions of the masses and the opinions of Comrade Wu Ren and others from the Special Commissioner's Office Thrift Inspection Committee, the County Thrift Inspection Committee decided that Li Guicheng and Liu Jitang should conduct another review. However, Li Guicheng's statement was still not thorough, while Liu Jitang dealt with it perfunctorily, attempting to shift the focus of the struggle. Li Guicheng and Liu Jitang both adopted the approach of suppressing democracy, rectifying subordinates but not superiors. As a result, the masses' reports on corruption were suppressed. For example, Xue Guifen, the deputy director of the County Cultural Center, requested to speak at the conference to report corrupt elements, but they did not allow him to speak. Some comrades lost confidence in the movement, while others were concerned about retaliation. Thus, the movement came to a standstill. Originally, at a group meeting on January 27, the corrupt element Liu Zhaomin had confessed to more than 2 million yuan, but because Liu Jitang and Liu Zhaomin had formed an "offensive and defensive alliance," Liu Zhaomin then overturned the already confessed materials. In fact, judging from the existing evidence, Liu Zhaomin's corruption amount is also more than 10 million yuan. Another corrupt element, Xu Chucheng, is also a criminal who smokes opium and has consistently refused to confess. Based on the opinions of the masses, the County Thrift Inspection Committee limited Xu Chucheng to completely explain the problem before the afternoon of January 29, otherwise, it would suggest to the leaders to remove him from his post and handle him according to the law. However, Xu Chucheng still did not confess until February 2, and the leaders did not deal with Xu Chucheng either. The above can already illustrate Li Guicheng and Liu Jitang's situation of protecting corruption and obstructing the movement.

    Now, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the county-level government organs of Qi County has turned to the "assessment stage." It seems that the big corrupt elements of Qi County are about to get away with it. We ask relevant leaders to immediately check and correct this.
    The CCP Qi County Committee Office, Shanxi Province Yuan Bin
    The CCP Qi County Discipline Inspection Committee, Shanxi Province Wu Jingxin

    Editor's Note: We completely agree with the opinions of Comrades Yuan Bin and Wu Jingxin. The mistakes of the leading cadres of the Qi County Government organs are not allowed. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government should immediately investigate and deal with this.

    Support the Death Sentence for Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan

    Editor: On February 10, the Hebei Provincial People's Government sentenced Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, the great corrupt elements who harmed the country and the people and committed heinous crimes, to death and executed them immediately. This fact fully demonstrates that the Communist Party and the People's Government have the determination and strength to repel the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks, remove any fortresses placed by capitalists in the revolutionary camp, and clear the way for the country's construction and the future of socialism. This wise and correct measure is fully in line with the revolutionary interests of the Party, the country, and the people. I express my firm support. Currently, the nationwide battle to relentlessly pursue and eliminate large corrupt elements has been fiercely launched. Due to the timely execution of Liu and Zhang, the fighting courage of the broad masses has been further enhanced. I hope that corrupt elements, especially large corrupt elements, will make a decisive decision, thoroughly confess, and take the broad path of the people's leniency, and not take the dead-end road of Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, Xue Kunshan, and Song Degui. Zhang Bingqian

    The news that the great corrupt elements Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were sentenced to death made me further realize the greatness and justice of the Chinese Communist Party. The Communist Party is selfless and puts the interests of the country and the people first in everything. Whoever endangers the interests of the country and the people will receive the punishment they deserve. No criminal will be forgiven because of his high position or long qualifications. Through this matter, we have more courage and confidence to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks and strive to build a new China. Chen Buxiang

    Editor: After reading the judgment of the great corrupt elements Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, the students of Peking University unanimously expressed their support. They believe that this sentence is correct, and it fully demonstrates the selflessness of the People's Government and the Communist Party. The students deeply realized that no matter what revolutionary cadre, if he degenerates and betrays the people, he will not be forgiven by the people. Corrupt elements and illegal merchants should quickly confess and bow their heads to the people to admit their guilt, otherwise, they will be severely punished. Peking University Communications Group

    Jian Merchants Wang Zhenghua, Etc. in the Slaughtering Industry in Nanzheng, Shaanxi

    Collective Bribery, Illegal Tax Evasion Should Be Punished

    Editor: Wang Zhenghua, Wang Bingchen, Liu Zhenghan and other Jian merchants in the slaughtering industry in Nanzheng City, Shaanxi Province, collectively bribed and seduced cadres, illegally evaded taxes, causing significant losses to state property.

    Wang Zhenghua is the chairman of the Nanzheng City Slaughtering Industry Association. When the city tax bureau sent Comrade Li Xirong to the industry to check the slaughtering tax, Wang Zhenghua, Wang Bingchen, and Liu Zhenghan treated him warmly with cigarettes, tea, wine, and meals, and said to Li Xirong, "You are from another village, and life is very hard now. I will introduce you to a lover, and it will be good to start a family." Li Xirong was a retained personnel and his thinking had not been well transformed. He was quickly dragged into the water by Wang and others. Seeing that the bribery to Li was successful, Wang and others tried every means to bribe other cadres of the city tax bureau. This bribery behavior expanded to the entire city's slaughtering industry. Not only that, Wang Zhenghua and others also organized a tax evasion joint organization, and divided the spoils with Li Xirong. At the beginning of the anti-bribery movement, this group of Jian merchants not only did not honestly confess their crimes, but also asked people to call corrupt elements to Liu Zhenghan's house to discuss countermeasures and sabotage the movement; they also made an "offensive and defensive alliance" with the corrupt elements and refused to confess. I suggest that the government should severely punish these big Jian merchants who collectively bribe, seduce cadres, and violate laws and disciplines. Xie Yuqing

    Worker Zhang Yuhe and Wang Yuezeng Stood Firm and Made Jian Merchant Ma Xiang's Tricks Fail

    Editor: Ma Xiang, a Jian merchant from Ma Ji Grain Store in the 10th District of Beijing, repeatedly played tricks in an attempt to resist the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-cutting corners, anti-theft of state property, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement. At the beginning of the movement, Ma Xiang knew that he had many crimes, so he tried to dismiss the workers. He said to the workers Zhang Yuhe and Wang Yuezeng, "Our shop is not doing well, and we have no working capital. You guys go home!" Seeing that Zhang and Wang were not fooled, he then wanted to introduce them to work in other stores. Zhang and Wang firmly refused. Ma Xiang's several conspiracies failed, so he adopted the method of slandering Zhang and Wang. He said to Zhang, "You want to report me, I'm not afraid. My son also knows that you took one million yuan and two belts on the counter." But this method was still ineffective. Finally, he threatened the workers by restricting their activities and refusing to pay the trade union cultural and educational funds. Zhang Yuhe and Wang Yuezeng stood firm on the working class's position and finally reported the Jian merchant Ma Xiang's tax evasion, cutting corners. Lei Peiran

    Leading Cadres of the Publicly-Run Xinsheng Oil Factory Protected Jian Merchants Who Cut Corners

    Editor: More than a year ago, I was a worker in the publicly-run Xinsheng Oil Factory in Nanyuan, Beijing. At that time, the factory was building a machine room. This project was contracted by the private Yihegong Construction Factory in Beijing. At the beginning of the project, the Jian merchants of the construction factory established a relationship with the factory director and others, inviting them to eat, drink, and watch operas. The factory director sent his confidant Li to supervise the work, while he himself rarely went to the site. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Jian merchants often stole the factory's wood, bricks, and cement. After being discovered by the workers, the Jian merchants said that they were "using the wrong materials." The workers reported the situation to the administration, but the administration said, "They didn't mean that." A part of the wall that the Jian merchants had just built collapsed after a heavy rain. The Jian merchants often did not follow the contract in terms of materials, but the administration turned a blind eye. The machine room project could not be completed on time, causing the factory to delay opening for a month. After completion, the machine room showed the following phenomenon: when it rained heavily outside, it rained lightly inside; when the rain stopped outside, it was still raining inside. Every time it rained, water containers were placed in the machine room, and it could not be started in the most serious cases. The workers were so angry that they said, "Simply, let Yihegong compensate for all the losses." But the factory director "sympathized" and said, "Yihegong did not 'make money', and several repairs have been enough to bear." The administration did not accept this lesson, and then entrusted the Jian merchants to build the factory director's office, office, etc. As a result, these projects were still cut corners. I suggest that relevant departments conduct an in-depth investigation of the egregious behavior of the leading cadres of the Xinsheng Oil Factory in protecting Jian merchants. Chen Zhigang

    衡阳专区机关反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动还没有展开
    编辑同志：目前湖南衡阳专区的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还是没有搞起来。这主要由于专区一级领导方面没有做到“首长负责，亲自动手”。学习形成自流，干部思想混乱。但是，根据一月七日中共湖南衡阳地方委员会扩大会议上所暴露出的材料看，中共衡阳地委、衡阳专员公署及其直属机关的贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象是严重的。
    首先是伪造单据、盗窃国家财富。衡阳专署土地改革委员会曾经伪造过三千一百五十万元建筑费和五百四十万元印刷费的单据。中共衡阳地方委员会曾经伪造过二千万元的汽车费、五百万元的修建费、一千三百万元汽油费、又二千万元修建费的单据。某些会伪造单据的干部，竟被认为是“好干部”。其次是搞投机生意，违反国家法令。中共衡阳地委机关曾经从专署地方财政内抽出五千万元，派地委秘书长刘德志做生意，赚钱或赔钱，公家都不知道。地委书记曾经从专署地方财政内“借”四亿二千万元给分区司令部经营商业，到现在还没有归还。专署机关曾经从专区地方企业公司抽出二亿元，经营棉花生意，企图攫取暴利；并且专派干部到上海、汉口、广州、沈阳等地去搞。专署专搞“生产”的干部崔林斌，曾经因犯法被公安局由外地拘捕送回来，但是现在他还在沈阳卖棉花。专署财政经济委员会和酃县人民政府勾通，从一九五零年十月到现在为止，曾经盗窃国家木材非法出售，从中攫取暴利十多亿元。另外，任意挥霍，铺张浪费也很严重。专员刘君实被调走时，先后请客十次，单吃喝的费用就花了二千多万元，其它送礼、看戏等还没有计算在内。地委机关每年的开支，除上级发给的经费外，还要从“机关生产”、地方财政中抽二亿五千万元补空。可见挥霍之惊人！
    从上述情况看，衡阳专区的问题是严重的，必须迅速地大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。我们建议有关领导方面迅速检查。
              韩玉生　刘流　田萍
    编者按：从读者揭发的材料来看，衡阳专区一级机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动所以没有搞起来，主要原因是某些领导干部的手面不干净。有关机关应该立即检查处理。
    山西省祁县领导干部手上不干净阻碍运动开展
    编辑同志：山西省祁县县级机关的领导干部阻挠着反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的开展。
    运动开始时，中共祁县县委书记李贵成同志（原是县长，一九五一年九月改任县委书记）对自己的问题交代了一下，但是坦白得不彻底，群众表示不满意。副县长柳洎塘（祁县节约检查委员会主任），根本没有交代自己的问题。一月二十一日，大举围剿贪污分子的时候，政府机关各单位都一致认为祁县医院院长兼县人民政府卫生科科长许初成、县人民政府总务股股长柳肇敏等都是主要的斗争对象，但李贵成、柳洎塘却采取了消极态度，不管群众意见。因为，许初成、柳肇敏的贪污和柳洎塘有关。县节约检查委员会根据群众意见和专署节约检查委员会吴仁等同志的意见，决定李贵成、柳洎塘再次检讨。但是，李贵成谈的还是不彻底，而柳洎塘则应付了事，企图转移斗争目标。李贵成、柳洎塘都采取了压制民主、整下不整上的做法。因而，群众对有关贪污的检举被压下去了。如县文化馆副馆长薛贵棻在大会上要求发言检举贪污分子，他们竟不让他说话。有的同志对运动失去了信心，有的同志则产生了怕报复的顾虑。于是，运动陷于停止状态。本来在一月二十七日的一个小组会上，贪污分子柳肇敏已经坦白出二百多万元来，但是由于柳洎塘和柳肇敏订立了“攻守同盟”，柳肇敏接着就推翻了已经坦白的材料。其实，就已经有的证据看来，柳肇敏的贪污数也在一千万元以上。另一个贪污分子许初成，同时也是抽大烟的罪犯，一直拒不坦白。县节约检查委员会根据群众意见，限许初成在一月二十九日下午以前彻底交代问题，否则建议领导方面对他撤职法办。但是，直到二月二日许初成还是没有交代，领导方面对许初成也不作处理。以上已经可以说明李贵成、柳洎塘包庇贪污、阻碍运动的情况了。
    现在，祁县县级政府机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，已经转到“鉴定阶段”了。眼看祁县的大贪污分子就要混过去。我们要求有关领导方面立即检查纠正。
    中共山西祁县县委办公室  原斌
    中共山西祁县县委纪律检查委员会　武景信
    编者按：我们完全同意原斌、武景信同志的意见。祁县县政府机关领导干部的错误是不能容许的。山西省人民政府应立即检查处理。

    拥护判处刘青山张子善死刑
    编辑同志：二月十日，河北省人民政府宣判祸国殃民、罪大恶极的大贪污犯刘青山、张子善二人死刑，并立即执行。这一事实，充分说明了共产党、人民政府有决心、有力量打退资产阶级的疯狂进攻，拔除资本家安置在革命阵营中的任何堡垒，为国家的建设及社会主义的前途廓清道路。这一英明正确的措施，完全符合于党和国家及人民的革命利益。我表示坚决拥护。目前，全国各地穷追大贪污分子的歼灭战已经猛烈展开。由于对刘、张二犯的及时处决，更增强了广大群众的斗争勇气。我希望贪污分子特别是大贪污分子，当机立断，彻底坦白，走人民的宽宏大道，不要走刘青山、张子善、薛崑山、宋德贵的死路。　张秉谦
    大贪污犯刘青山、张子善被判处死刑的消息，使我更进一步认识到中国共产党的伟大和公正。共产党大公无私，处处以国家人民利益为重，谁要是危害国家人民的利益，谁就要受到应得的处分。任何罪犯都不会因地位高、资格老而被宽恕。通过这件事情，我们更有勇气，有信心，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，为建设新中国而奋斗。　陈步湘
    编辑同志：北京大学的同学们读了大贪污犯刘青山、张子善的判决书后，一致表示拥护。他们认为这个判处是正确的，它充分表现了人民政府和共产党的大公无私。同学们深切地体会到，不论任何革命干部，要是他堕落蜕化，背叛人民，都是得不到人民的宽恕的。贪污分子和不法商人应该赶快坦白，向人民低头认罪，否则，将会受到严惩。

    陕西南郑屠宰业奸商王正华等
    集体行贿违法漏税应予惩办
    编辑同志：陕西省南郑市屠宰业奸商王正华、王秉臣、刘正汉等，集体行贿，勾引干部，违法漏税，使国家财富遭受到重大损失。
    王正华是南郑市屠宰业公会的理事长，当市税局派李希荣同志到该行业查屠宰税时，王正华就和王秉臣、刘正汉两人用烟茶酒饭来殷勤招待，并对李希荣说：“你是外乡人，现在生活很苦，我给你介绍个爱人，成个家就好了。”李希荣是个留用人员，思想还没有得到很好的改造，很快就被王等拖下水了。王等见向李行贿得逞，更千方百计向市税局的其他干部行贿。这种行贿行为扩大到全市屠宰业。不只如此，王正华等还组织了一个偷税联合组织，和李希荣一起坐地分赃。在反行贿运动开始时，这批奸商不但不老老实实地坦白自己的罪恶，还托人叫贪污分子到刘正汉家商量对策，破坏运动；又和贪污分子订立“攻守同盟”，拒绝交代。我建议政府应严加法办这种集体行贿，勾引干部，违反法纪的大奸商。　谢宇清
    工人张玉和王月增站稳立场使奸商马祥的花招都失败了
    编辑同志：北京第十区马记粮店奸商马祥一再耍花样，企图对抗反行贿、反偷税漏税、反偷工减料、反盗骗国家财产、反盗窃国家经济情报运动。运动一开始，马祥知道自己有很多罪行，就想法解雇工人。他对工人张玉和、王月增说：“咱们铺子营业不好，流动资金已没有了，你们回家去吧！”他看见张、王两人不上当，接着，又要介绍他们到别家商店去工作。张、王坚决拒绝了。马祥几次阴谋失败，就采取了对张、王进行诬蔑的手段。他对张说：“你们想检举我，我不怕。我的儿子也知道你在柜台上曾拿过一百万元和两根皮带。”但是这个方法依然毫无效验。最后，他用限制工人活动，拒交工会文教经费来威胁工人。张玉和、王月增站稳工人阶级立场，终于检举了奸商马祥偷税、漏税、偷工减料的行为。　雷沛然
    公营新生油厂领导干部包庇奸商偷工减料
    编辑同志：一年多以前，我是北京南苑公营新生油厂的工人。那时，该厂正在盖机器房。这个工程由北京私营义和公营造厂承包。工程一开始，营造厂的奸商就和该厂厂长等拉交情，请他们吃酒看戏。厂长派了亲信李某监工，自己则很少深入现场。奸商利用这个机会，时常偷窃厂里的木材、砖和洋灰。被工人发现后，奸商就说是“用错了”。工人把情况反映给行政方面，行政方面竟说：“他们不是这个意思。”奸商刚修建好的一道围墙，经过一阵大雨，就冲塌了一部分。奸商在用材料方面，常常不按合同办事，行政方面却不闻不问。机器房工程不能如期完工，使工厂延迟一个月开工。完工后，机器房出现了这样的现象：外面下大雨，里面下小雨；外面雨停了，里面还下雨。每逢下雨，机器房里都摆上盛水器，最严重时不能开工。气得工人们说：“干脆，由义和公包赔一切损失。”而厂长却“同情”地说：“义和公没有‘赚钱’，修补几次已够受了。”行政方面不接受这次教训，紧接着还委托奸商盖厂长室、办公室等。结果，这些工程依然被偷工减料。我建议有关部门深入检查新生油厂领导干部这种包庇奸商的恶劣行为。
