Hatred! Unsurpassed hatred! The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is dearer to us than our own flesh and blood, yet there are those who are harming them in secret! Deceiving them! And those who are doing these outrageous things are not our familiar enemies, but people who, in form, are still within our camp, of the same race, language, and script, growing up together on the same land. It is a gang of奸商’s vicious schemes that are secretly harming the Volunteer Army.

Throughout China, throughout the world, regardless of men, women, old or young, all peace-loving people ardently love and sincerely respect our heroic Volunteer Army. The whole world is inspired by their just and heroic deeds. All of China, regardless of men, women, old or young, are grateful for their meritorious service in defending the motherland. Therefore, countless workers and peasants in factories and farms are working selflessly to increase production to support them; grandmothers are putting on their reading glasses to meticulously sew comfort bags for the Volunteer Army; and even in the innocent hearts of children, there is fervent longing for the Volunteer Army uncles, saving their candy money to support them. But amidst the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on us, a vanguard has emerged—a vanguard that has lost all conscience and humanity. They are actually harming our most beloved people—the People's Volunteer Army—from behind, in all aspects of medicine, food, and equipment. This can be tolerated, but what cannot be tolerated!

The bourgeoisie's attack on us has become so rampant: Li Yinting, a奸商 from Hankou, stole good cotton entrusted to him by the people of the motherland and used old, rotten cotton picked from garbage bins to make first-aid kits, which were then shipped to the Korean front; Wang Kangnian, a奸商 from Shanghai, defrauded the Volunteer Army of huge sums of money for purchasing medicine, engaged in speculation and profiteering in the market, deliberately delaying delivery, delivering less than agreed, or substituting inferior goods for good ones; there were also some奸商 who harmed our Volunteer Army through food. In Hangzhou, some奸商 used stone alkali instead of baking soda and second-grade flour instead of first-grade flour in the custom-made military biscuits, causing our Volunteer Army to suffer from parched lips and throats. In Beijing, a奸商 mixed fine white sand into pickled radish, causing the Volunteer Army to suffer from stomach and intestinal damage, while they lined their own pockets and reaped exorbitant profits. Do this series of facts not sufficiently illustrate how ruthless, vicious, shameless, and inhuman the lawless capitalists are?

The bourgeoisie's attack on us is diverse and national. Learning from the lessons, we must carry the battle—the counter-attack against the bourgeoisie—through to the end. We will not withdraw our troops until complete victory is won. In the logic of the bourgeoisie, selfish self-interest, harming others to benefit oneself, using public office for private gain, and seeking exorbitant profits are commonplace and shameless. Therefore, we must also wage a relentless struggle against the bourgeoisie's decadent ideology! We must, in this movement, make the people of the whole country recognize the various ugly faces and insidious methods of the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly eradicate the scum like Wang Kangnian and Li Yinting, to ensure the consolidation of our people's democratic revolution and further progress towards a happier and more beautiful socialist society.

Although the奸商 Wang Kangnian and Li Yinting and their ilk still reside on the land of our motherland, and still eat the food produced by our working people, their actions have turned them into accomplices of the American war-mongers. We will never coexist with them. May our People's Government promptly eliminate them, just as one eliminates weeds from a rice paddy!

    我们和暗害志愿军的奸商不共戴天
    清华大学教授　华罗庚
    恨！无比的忿恨！中国人民志愿军比我们的亲骨肉还要亲，但竟有人在暗害他们！欺骗他们！而做这些伤天害理的事情的人，并不是我们所熟知的仇敌，而是形式上依然在我们阵营之内，和我们同种同族同语言同文字在同一块土地上同生共长的人。是一批奸商们的毒计诡谋在暗害着志愿军。
    在全中国，在全世界，无论男女老幼，一切爱好和平的人们，谁都热烈地爱戴，由衷地尊敬我们英雄的志愿军。全世界都为他们的正义的英雄事迹所鼓舞。全中国无论男女老幼都感谢他们捍卫祖国的功勋。因此，工厂农场中无数的工人农民忘我劳动地增加生产来支援他们；老祖母们戴上了老花眼镜为志愿军密密地缝制慰劳袋；在小孩们的天真心灵里也热烈地怀念着志愿军叔叔，而节省糖果费去支援他们。但在资产阶级对我们猖狂进攻之中，竟出现了一支尖兵——丧尽天良毫无人性的一支尖兵。他们竟在背后，从医药食品装备各方面来暗伤我们的最可爱的人——人民志愿军。此可忍，孰不可忍！
    资产阶级对我们的进攻竟猖狂到如此程度：汉口的奸商李寅廷盗窃祖国人民交给他的好棉花，而用垃圾箱里拣来的旧烂棉花制成救急包，运往朝鲜前线；上海的奸商王康年骗取志愿军购药的巨款，在市场上投机倒把，故意迟交、少交，或以劣货代好货；还有些奸商们从食品上暗伤我们的志愿军，杭州有的奸商在定制军用饼干中用石碱充苏打，用二号面换头号面，使我们志愿军吃了唇焦口渴。北京有一奸商在腌疙瘩萝卜中掺入细白砂，使志愿军吃了损胃坏肠，而他们则大饱私囊从中攫取暴利。这一连串的事实还不足够说明不法资本家是多么心狠，多么恶毒，多么无耻和无人性吗？
    资产阶级对我们的进攻是多样性的，全国性的。吸取教训，我们必须把战斗——对资产阶级反攻的战斗进行到底。不获全胜，誓不收兵。在资产阶级的逻辑里，自私自利，损人利己，假公济私，贪图暴利等腐朽思想，是习以为常恬不知耻的。所以我们还必须和资产阶级的腐朽思想，做无情的斗争！我们必须在这次运动中，让全国人民认清资产阶级的各种丑恶面貌和阴险手法，彻底铲除像王康年、李寅廷之流的败类，来保证我们人民民主革命胜利的巩固和进一步走向更幸福更美好的社会主义社会。
    奸商王康年、李寅廷之流虽然还寄居在我们祖国的土地上，虽然还吃着我们劳动人民所生产的食粮，但他们的所作所为，已经变成美国战争贩子的帮凶了。我们和他们不共戴天，愿我人民政府及时地剪除他们，如同剪除秧田中的莠草一样！
