    Xinhua News Agency, February 16th, New Delhi Dispatch: The elections for the Indian Parliament and the legislative assemblies of various states (provinces), which began last October, are nearing completion. The Indian National Congress has won a majority of seats in the People's House (i.e., the Lower House), but has not obtained a decisive majority in the legislative assemblies of Travancore-Cochin, Madras, Orissa, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, and Rajasthan.
    The People's Democratic United Front, led by the Communist Party of India, is demonstrating its growing influence in the elections.
    In Madras Province, the election results for the Legislative Assembly have been fully revealed: the Congress Party won 152 seats, the Communist Party 62 seats, the Peasants and Workers Party 35 seats, the Socialist Party 13 seats, the Scheduled Castes Federation 2 seats, other parties 49 seats, and independent candidates 62 seats. According to a TASS dispatch from Madras: the Madras Provincial Government resigned on February 8.
    The People's Democratic United Front has also achieved great victories in other places. According to "Pravda" reporter Bo Chengke: as of February 4, in Hyderabad State, 92 candidates from the Indian National Congress were elected as members of the Legislative Assembly, and more than 50 candidates from the People's Democratic United Front were elected as members of the Legislative Assembly. In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections, 26 communists were elected (note: two more were elected after February 4, making a total of 28). In Calcutta, Communist leader Naskol was elected. Gopalan, one of the Communist leaders in southern India, has been elected as a member of Parliament. According to the "Hindustan Times": in the Tirukoilur constituency, Communist Ashutha Menon has won the election for the Legislative Assembly of Travancore-Cochin State. Travancore Communist leader Ruanus has been elected as a member of Parliament. In North Mathura District, Communist leader Ramamurti, who has been imprisoned for four years, was successfully elected.
    Indian newspapers confirm that the leaders of the Indian Socialist Party have been defeated in the elections. Even the British "Manchester Guardian" admits that "the Indian Socialist Party has almost completely failed nationwide."

    印度共产党领导的人民民主统一阵线
    在印度大选中获得重要胜利
    【新华社十六日讯】新德里消息：去年十月开始的印度国会和各邦（省）立法会议的选举即将结束。印度国大党获得了人民院（即下院）的多数席次，但在特拉凡哥尔—柯钦、马德拉斯、奥里萨、巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟、剌查斯坦等邦（省）立法会议中则没有得到决定性的多数。
    以印度共产党为首的人民民主统一阵线在选举中显示着它的日益扩大的影响。
    在马德拉斯省，立法会议的选举结果已全部揭晓：国大党获得一百五十二席，共产党六十二席，农工人民党三十五席，社会党十三席，表列种姓联盟二席，其他党派四十九席，无党派人士六十二席。据塔斯社马德拉斯讯：马德拉斯省政府已在二月八日辞职。
    人民民主统一阵线并在其他地方获得巨大胜利。据“真理报”记者波诚科报道：到二月四日为止，在海得拉巴邦，印度国大党有九十二个候选人当选为立法会议议员，人民民主统一阵线有五十多个候选人当选为立法会议议员。在西孟加拉省立法会议的选举中共产党有二十六人当选（按：二月四日后又有二人当选，共为二十八人）。在加尔各答，共产党领袖纳斯科尔当选。印度南部的共产党领袖之一高普兰已当选为国会议员。据“印度斯坦时报”消息：在特里古尔选区，共产党员阿舒塔·梅农已在特拉凡哥尔—柯钦邦立法会议选举中获胜。特拉凡哥尔共产党领袖鲁安努斯已当选为国会议员。在北马都拉区，已被监禁达四年之久的共产党领袖拉马穆蒂胜利获选。
    印度报纸证实：印度社会党领袖们已在选举中遭到失败。甚至英国“曼彻斯特卫报”也承认“印度社会党在全国差不多完全失败”。
