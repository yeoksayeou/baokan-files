    Gong Tongxuan Should Make a New Self-Criticism
    The CCP Baoding Municipal Committee Office, Li Chun, Gu Yu
    Editor's Note: Judging from the facts revealed by Li Chun and Gu Yu, Gong Tongxuan not only received bribes from the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, but also shielded Liu and Zhang. This proves that Gong Tongxuan's past self-criticism (see page 3 of this newspaper on January 15) was dishonest. Gong Tongxuan should quickly and unreservedly confess and criticize all her wrongdoings of accepting bribes and shielding embezzlers.
    After reading the article "My Self-Criticism for Accepting Gifts from Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan" written by Gong Tongxuan in the People's Daily, we found that this self-criticism is inconsistent with her true thoughts and actions.
    Gong Tongxuan is a member of the CCP Baoding Municipal Committee and the Minister of Propaganda. She is the wife of Comrade Lin Tie, the Secretary of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee. The major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan lavishly bribed her. Gong Tongxuan not only repeatedly accepted bribes, but also openly shielded Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. Last year, when Gong Tongxuan learned that the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau had discovered Liu and Zhang's embezzlement, she wrote a letter to Kang Guangyu, who was in charge of production at the Tianjin Prefectural Committee, attempting to discuss ways to shield and cover up Liu and Zhang's mistakes with him. This did not succeed because Kang was arrested. After this, Gong Tongxuan said: "The criticism of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan should not be too harsh." Even after the Hebei Provincial Third Party Congress exposed the embezzlement crimes of Liu and Zhang and arrested Zhang Zishan, Gong Tongxuan still spread the word in the Baoding delegation's group meeting, saying: "The work in Hebei Province is best in the Tianjin Special District. The embezzlement of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan is only an accidental mistake." At the Third Party Congress held in Baoding City, Gong Tongxuan still did not examine her own mistakes. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched in Baoding City, Gong Tongxuan only made a superficial self-criticism, reluctantly admitting that she had accepted bribes. But the next day, she changed "accepting bribes" to "accepting gifts." She went everywhere to "listen to the wind" and studied how to "get off the stage" and "pass the test." In short, what Gong Tongxuan said in her self-criticism, such as "The Liu and Zhang incident has sounded the alarm for me," "I have initially realized that I have made serious mistakes," etc., is completely untrue. Gong Tongxuan not only did not honestly confess and criticize her mistakes to the Party and the people, but instead used these high-sounding words to cover up her erroneous behavior of resisting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. This is not allowed by the Party and the People's Government. Gong Tongxuan should immediately wake up and thoroughly admit her mistakes to the Party and the people.

    弓彤轩应重新作检讨
    中共保定市委办公室  李春  谷雨
    编者按：从李春、谷雨所揭发的事实来看，弓彤轩不只受过大贪污犯刘青山、张子善的贿赂，而且有包庇刘、张的行为。这证明了弓彤轩过去的检讨（见一月十五日本报三版）是不诚实的。弓彤轩应该迅速地毫无保留地坦白和批判自己受贿和包庇贪污分子的一切错误行为。
    我们在人民日报上读了弓彤轩写的《检讨我接受刘青山、张子善礼物的错误》一文后，发现这一检讨和她的真实思想、行动是不符合的。
    弓彤轩是中共保定市委会委员、宣传部长，是中共河北省委书记林铁同志的爱人，大贪污犯刘青山、张子善曾对她大行贿赂。弓彤轩不只一而再，再而三地收受贿赂。而且公然包庇刘青山、张子善。去年弓彤轩得悉中共中央华北局发觉刘、张有贪污行为时，便写信给负责天津地委机关生产的康光宇，企图和他商量包庇和掩护刘、张错误的办法。后因康被逮捕未逞。此后，弓彤轩曾说：“对刘青山、张子善的批评，不必过于严厉。”直到河北省第三次党的代表会议上揭露了刘、张的贪污罪行，并逮捕了张子善后，弓彤轩还在保定代表团小组会上散布空气说：“河北省的工作，数天津专区好，刘青山、张子善的贪污，只不过是偶然的错误。”在保定市召开的第三次党的代表会议上，弓彤轩依然不检讨自己的错误。保定市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，弓彤轩只作了一个肤浅的检讨，勉强承认自己有受贿的行为。但到第二天却又把受贿说成“受礼”。她到处“听风声”，研究如何“下台”“过关”。总之，弓彤轩在检讨中所说的“刘、张事件给我敲响了警钟”，“我已初步认识到自己是犯了严重的错误，”等等，完全是不真实的。弓彤轩不只没有老老实实地向党向人民坦白、批判自己的错误，反而拿这些冠冕堂皇的字句，掩盖其抵抗反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的错误行为。这是党和人民政府所不能容许的。弓彤轩应立即醒悟，彻底向党和人民承认错误。
