    Tongxian No. 1 Girls' Middle School, Wang Shulan
    Reports Her Father and Brother for Tax Evasion

    Editor: Wang Shulan, a student at Tongxian No. 1 Girls' Middle School in Hebei Province, is a member of the Communist Youth League. Her father, Wang Ruan, and her brother, Wang Qifeng, run a hemp knife shop in Tongzhen. When Wang Shulan returned home for the Spring Festival, she saw that her father and brother were restless. She thought they must have done something wrong, something that cheated the country and the people. She advised them, "If there is a problem, you should quickly confess to the People's Government." But the response she received was: "Our family is honest and law-abiding, what problem could there be? Little children should mind their own business!" Seeing that they were unwilling to confess, Wang Shulan thought to herself, "If you don't confess, I will report you." Therefore, she began to collect evidence of their illegal activities. Initially, her father and her brother were very afraid of her. Whenever they were whispering together, they would quickly stop when they saw her coming. Wang Shulan learned from their conversations that they had evaded taxes and illegally traded gold and silver. After grasping this evidence, she repeatedly urged them to confess, but they remained unrepentant and refused to confess. Her father, with a mournful face, said to her, "Child, my old life is in your hands! If you expose us, how will the whole family live?" At this time, Wang Shulan's thoughts were in a fierce struggle. But when she remembered the slogan she had shouted at school, "Resolutely fight the illegal merchants to the end," and the oath she had taken when joining the League, "Willing to fight for the New Democratic cause to the end," she gained courage and strength. She made up her mind to report her father and her brother's illegal activities. At the citizens' meeting, she boldly exposed her father and her brother's crimes of stealing national property. She said indignantly, "The unscrupulous merchants are stumbling blocks on the road of progress of our new society, they are enemies of our people, I cannot but report you."

    通县第一女中王淑兰
    检举了他父亲和哥哥的偷税行为
    编辑同志：河北省通县第一女子中学学生王淑兰是一个青年团员。她的父亲王如安和哥哥王起凤，在通镇开了一个麻刀铺。王淑兰在春节回家的时候，看见她的父亲和哥哥坐卧不安。她想他们一定做了欺骗国家欺骗人民的亏心事。她劝告他俩说：“有问题就应该赶快去向人民政府交代。”但是她得到的答复却是：“咱家老老实实，有啥问题。小孩子，少管闲事！”王淑兰见他俩不肯坦白，心里想：“你们再不坦白，我就检举。”因此她开始收集他俩的犯法材料。最初她的父亲和她的哥哥很怕她，他俩在一起咕噜咕噜讲话的时候，一见她来，就赶快停住嘴了。王淑兰从谈话中知道他俩曾经偷税和盗卖黄金、白银。她掌握这些材料以后，就再三动员他俩坦白，但是他俩依然执迷不悟，拒不坦白。他的父亲哭丧着脸对她说：“孩子，我这老命在你手里呀！你揭露了，全家还要生活吗？”这时，王淑兰的思想剧烈地斗争起来了。但是当她想起她在学校曾经喊过“坚决与不法商人斗争到底”的口号，在入团的时候曾经宣誓“愿为新民主主义事业奋斗到底”的时候，她就有了勇气，有了力量。她下定决心检举她的父亲和她的哥哥的不法行为。在开市民大会的时候，她大胆地揭发了她的父亲和她的哥哥的盗窃国家资财的罪行。她激愤地说：“奸商是我们新社会前进途中的绊脚石，是我们人民的敌人，我不能不检举你们。”
