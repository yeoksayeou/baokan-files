    Central Ministry of Light Industry Holds Mass Meeting
    to Struggle Against Left Zhenhai, a Spy Who Infiltrated State-Owned Enterprises
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Central Ministry of Light Industry held a struggle meeting on January 26th, to struggle against the criminal Left Zhenhai, a奸商 [jian shang: treacherous merchant] spy who had infiltrated the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill.
    The criminal Left Zhenhai was originally a small businessman from Xingtai County, Hebei Province. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he infiltrated the supply organs of the Taihang Military Region, working under He Guanghua (who was the section chief in that organ, and after the establishment of the Beijing Paper Industry Management Office, served as the director of its business department, and is now working in the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission). He was later purged due to suspicion of being a special agent. In 1948, when Yang Jieren (currently the acting director of the Beijing Paper Industry Management Office) passed through Shijiazhuang, he met Left Zhenhai through He's introduction. After the liberation of Tianjin, when Yang Jieren and He Guanghua served as military representatives of the Tianjin Huidui Paper Mill, Left Zhenhai immediately followed them to Tianjin with his shop assistants Xing Baomin, Chen Shenglin, and others, and jointly opened Xinfeng Freight, specializing in paper mill transactions, purchasing waste cotton, rags, alum, and other raw materials on commission. When Left Zhenhai first arrived in Tianjin, he only had 50,000 yuan in capital. In three years, he used various methods such as entertaining, giving gifts, and bribery to corrupt and seduce cadres of the paper mill, especially leading cadres such as Yang Jieren, He Guanghua, Jin Yinong (deputy director of Tianjin Paper Mill), Cao Chunming (director of Tianjin Paper Mill's sales office), and Li Zhonghe (deputy director of Tianjin Paper Mill's sales office). As a result, he obtained many special privileges and conveniences for theft. The ill-gotten gains he obtained through various illegal means are estimated to be over 700 million yuan. In September 1951, Left Zhenhai, through the introduction of Yang Jieren and Jin Yinong, infiltrated the Tianjin Paper Mill's sales office as the deputy head of the purchasing section. He then monopolized the power of procurement and embezzled state property on a large scale from within. Therefore, Left Zhenhai has now become a large奸商 [jian shang: treacherous merchant] with four commercial firms and hundreds of millions of yuan in liquid assets.
    The methods by which the criminal Left Zhenhai unscrupulously stole state property in transactions with the state-owned paper mill for three years were: (1) Buying and selling short, defrauding the paper mill's funds in the name of "prepayment of deposits" for business and interest gains. For example, in March 1949, the paper mill prepaid Left Zhenhai a deposit of 2 million yuan to buy 100,000 catties of flax, stipulating that it should be delivered within one month at a price limit of 100 yuan per catty. However, Left Zhenhai only delivered 15,000 catties one and a half months overdue, and the price exceeded the limit by 30 yuan per catty. In April of the same year, the paper mill ordered 50,000 catties of alum from Left, and the full amount of 2.2 million yuan was prepaid. It was stipulated that the goods should be delivered in five days, with a penalty of 100% for each day overdue. However, because the price of alum rose, Left Zhenhai owed 10,000 catties and refused to deliver it, instead using waste cotton and lead wire as substitutes, and the leaders of the paper mill did not punish him. On the other hand, Left Zhenhai did not pay cash for the paper he bought from the paper mill. In 1950, Left Zhenhai bought four batches of web paper from Taiyuan Paper Mill, worth hundreds of millions, without paying in advance. He only paid after he sold the goods and made money.
    (2) Adulterating and using inferior materials. Left Zhenhai sold a large number of raw materials to the Tianjin Paper Mill, such as waste cotton, rags, sulfur, and alum, accounting for more than 50% of the mill's total purchases. Left Zhenhai often used inferior goods to mix with good ones, adding water and rubber to waste cotton and rags, and adding stones to sulfur and alum. In 1949, Left Zhenhai sold a batch of waste cotton to the paper mill. Because there were too many cotton seeds and it had been rained on, 14 tons of it were completely unusable and could only be used as fertilizer.
    (3) Monopolizing trade and extracting commissions. Most of the raw materials for the Tianjin Paper Mill were purchased through Left Zhenhai, and paper mills under the Beijing Paper Industry Management Office also had to go through Left's hands when purchasing from the Tianjin Paper Mill. The paper mill had to pay him a commission of 1% to 2% for buying his goods; Left Zhenhai earned commissions from both the buyer and seller when he purchased goods on behalf of the paper mill. He could deliver goods that others could not, so rag and waste cotton merchants in Tianjin entrusted him to deliver goods to the paper mill in a unified manner, and Left Zhenhai took a profit of 100 yuan per catty. Left Zhenhai also secretly colluded with Yulicheng Commercial Firm, attempting to completely monopolize the rag and waste cotton market. Most seriously, even transactions between the paper mill and state-owned enterprises had to go through Left's hands. For example, in January 1951, the state-owned Limin Company directly sold 30 tons of sulfur to the Tianjin Paper Mill. Negotiations failed twice due to poor quality, but after Left Zhenhai introduced it, the mill immediately purchased it. On another occasion, Left Zhenhai bought sulfur for 3 million yuan per ton and resold it to the paper mill for 8.5 million yuan per ton, making a huge profit of 55 million yuan.
    (4) Stealing economic intelligence. When Left Zhenhai discovered that the inventory of a certain raw material was low, he immediately raised the price. For example, on one occasion, the Tianjin Paper Mill had only four tons of sulfur left, which was urgently needed, and entrusted Left Zhenhai to purchase it. He raised the price by 570,000 yuan per ton and sold 20 tons. In this transaction alone, the state lost 11.4 million yuan.
    (5) Dispatching spies to infiltrate the enterprise. In order to deploy internal lines and act as informants, Left Zhenhai introduced his shop assistants Xing Baomin and Chen Shenglin to work in the business department of the Beijing Paper Industry Management Office in the spring of 1950. Subsequently, he himself infiltrated the sales office of the Tianjin Paper Mill. After Left Zhenhai infiltrated the state-owned enterprise, he continued to do business and took commissions when purchasing raw materials. Most seriously, he used his authority to raise the price of rags, making huge profits for himself. For example, in November of last year, after Left Zhenhai raised the price of rags from 1,400 yuan to 2,400 yuan per kilogram, the more than 80,000 kilograms of rags and waste cotton stored in his Zhenxing Firm were immediately sold to the paper mill, making a huge profit of more than 80 million yuan. Other private merchants also successively sold a large amount of rags to the paper mill, causing great losses to the state.
    The reason why the奸商 [jian shang: treacherous merchant] spy Left Zhenhai was able to so brazenly attack state-owned enterprises and steal state property on a large scale is inseparable from the corrupt behavior of leading cadres such as Yang Jieren and He Guanghua of the Beijing Paper Industry Management Office in embezzling and accepting bribes. Yang Jieren and He Guanghua were both Communist Party members with more than ten years of revolutionary struggle history; but after entering the city, their desire for material enjoyment increased, and they were not vigilant against the bourgeoisie's attack, so they were hit by Left Zhenhai's sugar-coated bullets. They not only could not see or deliberately condoned Left Zhenhai's large-scale theft of state property, but also often boasted in front of the paper mill staff: "Old Left is a revolutionary businessman." When Left Zhenhai infiltrated the Tianjin Paper Mill, many cadres expressed dissatisfaction, and Yang Jieren, Jin Yinong, and others even felt that his position was too low and that he should be the deputy director of the sales office. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, these leading cadres still harbored extremely 麻痹 [mabi: apathetic] thoughts about Left Zhenhai, this bourgeois spy. When the Ministry of Light Industry decided to remove Left Zhenhai from his post, the leading cadres of the Tianjin Paper Mill were slow to implement it.
    At the struggle meeting held by the Central Ministry of Light Industry, the masses angrily accused the奸商 [jian shang: treacherous merchant] spy Left Zhenhai of colluding with and corrupting cadres, stealing state property, and severely struggled against the corrupt and bribery behavior of Yang Jieren, He Guanghua, and others. At the meeting, the chairman announced that Yang Jieren, the acting director of the Paper Industry Management Office, would be suspended from his duties for reflection; the奸商 [jian shang: treacherous merchant] Left Zhenhai was arrested on the spot and sent to the court for punishment; other related cadres with corrupt and bribery behavior will also be given due punishment depending on the severity of their crimes and the extent of their confession and repentance.

    中央轻工业部全体工作人员举行大会
    斗争打入国营企业的坐探左振海
    【本报讯】中央轻工业部全体工作人员在一月二十六日举行斗争大会，斗争打进国营天津纸厂的奸商坐探左犯振海。
    左犯振海原是河北邢台县的一个小商人，抗日战争时期曾混入太行军区供给机关，在贺光华（原在该机关担任科长，北京造纸工业管理处成立后，曾任该处营业部主任，现在军委后勤部工作）下面工作过，后因有特务嫌疑被清洗。一九四八年，杨介人（现任北京造纸工业管理处代处长）路过石家庄时，经贺介绍与左犯相识。天津解放后，当杨介人、贺光华分任天津灰堆纸厂正、副军代表职务时，左犯振海即率同店伙邢保民、陈盛林等跟到天津，和其他商人合股开设新丰货栈，专做纸厂买卖，代购废棉、破布、明矾等原料。左犯初到天津时，只有五万元人民币的资本，三年来，他用请客、送礼、行贿等各种方法腐蚀勾引纸厂的干部，特别是勾引杨介人、贺光华、靳一农（天津纸厂副厂长）、曹春明（天津纸厂营业所主任）、李中和（天津纸厂营业所副主任）等领导干部，因此取得不少行窃的特权和便利。他利用各种不法手段获取的暴利，据初步计算约达七亿余元。一九五一年九月，左犯经过杨介人、靳一农介绍，钻进了天津纸厂营业所任采购股副股长。于是他独揽采购大权，从内部来大量盗窃国家资财。因此，左振海现已成为拥有四家商号和数亿元流动资产的大奸商。
    左犯振海三年来在与国营纸厂交易中肆无忌惮地盗窃国家资财的方法是：（一）买空卖空，以“预付定金”的名义骗取纸厂资金做买卖、吃利息。如一九四九年三月，纸厂预付定金二百万元给左犯买线麻十万市斤，规定一个月交清，每斤限价一百元，但左振海过期一个半月才交一万五千市斤，且每斤逾价三十元。同年四月纸厂又向左订购白矾五万斤，全部价款二百二十万元预先付清，规定五天交货，过期一天罚百分之百，但因白矾涨了价，左振海还欠一万斤就不交了，改用废棉、铅丝代替，纸厂领导人也没罚他。但另一方面，左犯向纸厂买纸却不给现钱，一九五零年左犯先后向太原纸厂买盘纸四批，价值数亿，事先都未付款，等他把货卖掉赚了钱后才还。
    （二）掺水掺杂，偷工减料。左犯卖给天津纸厂大批原物料，如废棉、破布、硫磺、白矾等，占该厂收购总量的百分之五十以上。左犯经常以次货、劣货充混，在废棉、破布中掺水掺胶皮，在硫磺、白矾中掺石头。一九四九年左犯卖给纸厂一批废棉，因棉籽太多，淋过雨水，其中有十四吨根本不能使用了，只能做肥料。
    （三）垄断买卖，抽取佣金。天津纸厂大部原料都通过左犯购买，北京造纸工业管理处所属纸厂到天津纸厂采购时，也要经过左手。纸厂买他的货要给百分之一到百分之二的佣金；左犯替纸厂代买货，买卖双方都给左犯佣钱。别人交不上的货，他能交上，因此天津的破布废棉商都托他向纸厂统一交货，左犯则从中每斤取利一百元。左犯还暗中拉拢玉立成商号入伙，企图完全垄断破布废棉市场。最严重的是纸厂与公营企业交易也要经过左犯的手。例如一九五一年一月，公营利民公司直接售给天津纸厂硫磺三十吨，交涉两次都因质量不好未成交，但经左振海介绍，厂方便立即收购了。另一次左振海买进硫磺每吨三百万元，反手卖给纸厂每吨价款八百五十万元，得暴利五千五百万元。
    （四）盗窃经济情报。当左犯发现某种原物料库存不多时，就立刻抬高价格。例如有一次，天津纸厂内仅存硫磺四吨，需要很急，托左犯购买。他把每吨价格抬高五十七万元售出二十吨。仅这一次交易，国家就损失一千一百四十万元。
    （五）派遣坐探，混入企业内部。左犯为了布置内线，充当耳目，在一九五零年春先后介绍他的店伙邢保民、陈盛林到北京造纸工业管理处业务部工作，接着，他自己也打进天津纸厂营业所。左犯打入国营企业内部后，自己仍继续经商，并在采购原料时拿取佣金。特别严重的是利用职权，提高破布价格，使自己大获暴利。例如去年十一月左振海把破布由每公斤一千四百元提升到二千四百元后，他所经营的振兴行所存八万多公斤破布废棉立即全部售给纸厂，获暴利八千多万元。其他私商也相继向纸厂大量销售破布，造成国家极大的损失。
    奸商坐探左犯振海之所以能如此猖狂地向国营企业进攻，大量盗窃国家资财，是与北京造纸工业管理处领导干部杨介人、贺光华等贪污受贿的腐化行为分不开的。杨介人、贺光华两人都是共产党员，有十余年革命斗争历史；但在进城之后，物质享受的欲望日高，对资产阶级的进攻丝毫没有警惕，因此便被左犯振海的糖衣炮弹打中了。他们不但看不见或故意纵容左犯大量盗窃国家财产，反而常在纸厂工作人员面前夸说：“老左是个革命商人”。当左犯打入天津纸厂时，许多干部曾表示不满，杨介人、靳一农等还觉得他职位太低，应该做营业所副主任。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，这些领导干部对左振海这个资产阶级的坐探仍然抱有极端麻痹的思想。当轻工业部决定把左振海撤职时，天津纸厂领导干部还迟迟未执行。
    在中央轻工业部召开的斗争大会上，到会群众愤怒地控诉了奸商坐探左振海勾引腐蚀干部，盗窃国家财产的罪行，并严厉地向杨介人、贺光华等贪污受贿的行为进行了斗争。会上，主席宣布将造纸工业管理处代处长杨介人停职反省；奸商左振海当场逮捕送法院惩办；其他有关的有贪污受贿行为的干部也将视其罪行和坦白悔过程度，予以应有的处分。  （季崇威）
