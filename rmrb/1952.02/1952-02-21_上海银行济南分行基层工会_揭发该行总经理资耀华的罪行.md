    Shanghai Bank Jinan Branch Grassroots Union
    Exposes the Crimes of General Manager Zi Yaohua
    Editor: Our bank's General Manager and Tianjin Branch Manager Zi Yaohua's crimes exposed in the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence have already been widely reported in the newspapers. We believe that his hidden crimes must be even more numerous. According to news from Hong Kong: When our bank's Hong Kong branch closed its accounts in the first half of 1950, the actual profit was more than HK$800,000. At that time, the Hong Kong branch was preparing to telegraph the head office, but received a telegram from Zi Yaohua instructing them to report a profit of more than HK$360,000. This matter aroused suspicion and dissatisfaction among the employees of the Hong Kong branch. When we heard this report, we were extremely angry and felt that although Zi Yaohua had donned a progressive cloak after liberation, he was actually a treacherous merchant who violated government laws and regulations everywhere. We believe that having such a degenerate in the Shanghai Bank is a disgrace to all our employees, and we must purge him.

    上海银行济南分行基层工会
    揭发该行总经理资耀华的罪行
    编辑同志：我行总经理兼天津分行经理资耀华，在反行贿、反偷漏税，反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动中被揭发的罪行，报纸上已经记载很多了。我们觉得他的隐藏的罪行一定还很多。根据香港方面的消息：我行香港分行在一九五○年上期结账时，实际结盈港币八十余万元，当时香港分行正拟电告总处，却接到资耀华打去的电报，指定他们呈报结盈港币三十六万多元。这件事情，引起港行职工们的怀疑和不满，我们听到了这个报道，愤怒万分，觉得资耀华虽然在解放后披着进步的外衣，但是，实际上却是一个处处违反政府法令的奸商。我们认为上海银行有这样一个败类，是我们全体职工的耻辱，一定要把他清洗出去。
