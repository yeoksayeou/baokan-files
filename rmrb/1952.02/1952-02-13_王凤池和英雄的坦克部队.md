    Wang Fengchi and the Heroic Tank Unit
    In a certain battle last winter, Wang Fengchi and the heroes of a tank company of the Chinese People's Volunteers bravely drove their tanks into position. Although the enemy had built strong bunkers on every hill they occupied, surrounded by several layers of barbed wire and landmines, and with trenches and machine-gun nests along the mountains, the heroes of the tank company were all full of confidence and prepared to destroy the enemy's firepower and cover the infantry's assault on the hill positions.
    In the gun sights, the tank gunners saw the enemies on the mountain still dancing and wrestling gleefully. They said angrily, "You won't be dancing for long! Wait and see you dance with the shells!" The heroes aimed at the enemy's large bunkers and waited anxiously for the order. Suddenly, the signal went up, and hundreds of shells were fired at the enemy simultaneously. The tank where Wang Fengchi was located hit the enemy's company command post with the first shot, and all four shots hit the target. The enemy's position was seen to be filled with thick smoke, like a sea of fire. Our heroic infantry immediately launched a fierce attack on the hill.
    During the second firing, more than a dozen enemy planes appeared, bombing and strafing our tank positions in turn and throwing gasoline barrels. Some tanks caught fire. However, our heroic tank gunners and loaders did not relax their work for a moment and continued to calmly strike at the enemy. They continued in this manner until they suppressed the enemy's firepower and destroyed the enemy's 60mm mortar positions and more than fifty bunkers. The tank crew then immediately took off their cotton-padded coats, splashed them with water, and bravely put out the surrounding fires. At this time, the heroes only thought of one thing: "The tanks of the motherland's people must not be hit by the enemy's artillery fire." The fire was finally extinguished.
    Our heroic infantry and tank units occupied the hill position, which had cost the enemy three thousand men and six days and nights to seize, in just one hour, annihilating more than five hundred enemies. Wang Fengchi and his tank company were both awarded the Second Class Merit. (Attached picture)

    王凤池和英雄的坦克部队
    在去年冬天某次战斗中，王凤池和志愿军某坦克连的英雄们沉着地驾驶着坦克进入阵地。虽然敌人占领的每一个山头都筑有坚固的地堡，周围布有数道铁丝网和地雷，沿山又有交通沟和机枪巢，但是，坦克连的英雄们个个信心十足地准备着，一定要摧毁敌人的火力点，掩护步兵攻占山头阵地。
    在炮镜里，坦克手们看到山上的敌人还在得意地跳舞、摔角，他们气愤地说：“你们跳不多久了！等着看你们跟炮弹去跳舞吧！”英雄们瞄准了敌人的大地堡，紧张地等着命令。突然，信号升起了，数百发炮弹一齐投向了敌人。王凤池所在的坦克，头一炮就命中了敌人的连指挥所，连发四炮，都命中目标。只见敌人的阵地浓烟滚滚，像火海一样。我们英勇的步兵即向山头猛攻。
    在第二次射击时，十几架敌机出现了，敌机轮番向我们的坦克阵地轰炸、扫射并且扔汽油筒。有的坦克着火了。但是，我们英雄的坦克炮手和装弹手们，一刻也不放松他们的工作，继续沉着地痛击敌人。他们就是这样一直到压制住敌人的火力，摧毁了敌人的六○炮阵地和五十多个地堡。坦克手们又立即脱下自己的棉衣，泼上水，奋勇地扑灭周围的火堆。这时英雄们的脑子里只想到：“祖国人民的坦克，决不能让敌人的炮火打着。”火终于被扑灭了。
    我们英雄的步兵和坦克部队仅在一小时内，占领了敌人化费三千人的代价和六昼夜时间取得的山头阵地，歼灭敌人五百余名。王凤池和他的坦克连都立了二等功。（附图片）
