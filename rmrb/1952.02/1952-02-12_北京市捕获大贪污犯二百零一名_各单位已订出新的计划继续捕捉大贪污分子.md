    [This newspaper reports] The anti-corruption struggle in Beijing's various organs, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools has been deeply unfolded. As of February 10, various units have already captured 901 embezzlers who embezzled or accepted bribes of more than 10 million yuan, including 201 major embezzlers who embezzled or accepted bribes of more than 100 million yuan.

    In the early stages of the movement, leading cadres in various units did not sufficiently estimate the enemy's situation. Individual leading cadres even turned a blind eye to major embezzlers and were numb. In response to this situation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government issued instructions to the responsible cadres of key units, strictly criticizing this paralyzing thought; and instructed each unit to formulate plans based on various materials and conditions, stipulate tasks, and have the top leader personally organize the masses to capture "tigers" within a time limit. The battle to concentrate firepower on encircling and suppressing major embezzlers has become widespread.

    Experience has proved that any agency that uses and manages large amounts of money and goods, regardless of whether it is a Party, government, military, or civilian system, must have embezzlers, and there are also hidden major embezzlers. The Beijing financial and economic system captured 85 major embezzlers in the 20 days from January 19 to February 7, and found that approximately 17 billion yuan had been embezzled. Among the 85 major embezzlers captured, 25 belonged to the Industry and Commerce Bureau system (as of February 9, the Industry and Commerce Bureau system had captured 94 embezzlers who embezzled or accepted bribes of more than 10 million yuan, including 30 major embezzlers who embezzled or accepted bribes of more than 100 million yuan), 12 from the Municipal Construction Engineering Company, 14 from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank, 13 from the Municipal Taxation Bureau (including the Liquor Company), 7 from the Enterprise Company, 6 from the Public Utilities Bureau, 2 from the Yongmao Industrial Company, 4 from the Municipal Cooperative General Agency, and 2 from the Finance Bureau. In the past, some people thought that there were no big tigers in cultural and educational institutions; but in this stage, the various middle schools in Beijing alone have caught six "big tigers" who embezzled or accepted bribes of about 100 million yuan.

    Judging from the embezzlements that have been exposed, the bourgeoisie's attack on the country and the people in the past three years has been very rampant. The embezzlement cases of many state functionaries are inseparable from the enticement and corruption of private merchants. Most embezzlers collude with unscrupulous merchants by taking advantage of their positions, accepting bribes, and allowing unscrupulous merchants to evade taxes, cut corners, steal economic intelligence, and disrupt the market to seek exorbitant profits; some warehouse keepers collude with unscrupulous merchants collectively to steal or sell state property; and many embezzlers themselves are unscrupulous merchants who have infiltrated, or insiders sent by the bourgeoisie to state organs. For example, He Hongshan, a salesman at a department store, colluded with private merchants to increase purchase prices and embezzle from them. In seventeen transactions with Deji and Hongchang paper companies alone, he caused a loss of 850 million yuan to state property. Meng Xuezeng, the storage and transportation section chief of the Grain Company, was won over by Liu Changxin, a broker, through dinner invitations and other methods. In a transaction where the Grain Company bought sacks, the unscrupulous merchant Liu Changxin was allowed to make a fortune and open the Huaxin Wood Shop. Even the Grain Company's bidding for sleepers and high-stool springboards was manipulated by Liu Changxin. In 1950 alone, Liu Changxin illegally obtained 600 million yuan in illicit profits; the bribes accepted by Meng Xuezeng, as far as have been found, include nine taels of gold, one gold ring, one hundred silver dollars, three watches, one bicycle, and three yards of Western-style suit fabric. Ma Lianrui, deputy manager of the Third Grain Depot of the Grain Company, organized and planned the theft of large amounts of state property. In 1951, he and Li Keming (manager of the grain depot) jointly presided over a corruption meeting attended by seven cadres including Li Shikui and Lv Gui. It was decided that Li Keming would back him up, Ma Lianrui would sell to the city, Lv Gui would sell outside the city, Li Shikui would contact private merchants, and Bai Jinghe and others would weigh the goods. In this way, they stole more than 800,000 catties of state grain. Chang Weilian, a field worker at the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, is a major shareholder of Yichang, Tangshan Fuxing, and Kaiping Lifeng three fur and stationery shops in Beijing, and is also the manager of Yichang. After entering the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China at the end of March 1951, he used the name of a cadre of the People's Bank of China to fraudulently obtain confidential market information from the Beijing Branch of the China Animal Products Company, manipulate and monopolize the market, and confront state-owned trading companies. The criminal also used his position to lend 510 million yuan to Qingfenghou Fur Warehouse last year, enabling Qingfenghou to monopolize the wool market in Beijing. This company successively sold substandard goods to the Animal Products Company, totaling 9.8 billion yuan, causing the company to lose more than 500 million yuan.

    According to Beijing's experience in encircling and suppressing major embezzlers in January, to capture major embezzlers, it is first necessary to organize forces, collect and analyze materials, and determine the target of "tigers" based on evidence. At the same time, leading cadres must be determined to let go and mobilize the masses to carry out internal and external attacks.

    Now, various units in Beijing have formulated new plans to continue capturing major embezzlers.

### 北京市捕获大贪污犯二百零一名  各单位已订出新的计划继续捕捉大贪污分子

    北京市捕获大贪污犯二百零一名
    各单位已订出新的计划继续捕捉大贪污分子
    【本报讯】北京市各机关、团体、工矿、企业和学校等单位的反贪污斗争已深入开展。到二月十日止，各单位已经捕获贪污、受贿一千万元以上的贪污犯九百零一名，其中包括贪污、受贿一亿元以上的大贪污犯二百零一名。
    运动初期，各单位的领导干部对敌情估计十分不足，个别单位的领导干部甚至对大贪污犯熟视无睹，麻木不仁。针对这种情况，中共北京市委员会和市人民政府曾对各重点单位的负责干部发出指示，严格批评这种麻痹思想；并责成各单位根据各方的材料和条件，拟订计划，规定任务，由首长负责亲自动手组织群众捕捉“老虎”，限期具报。各单位集中火力围剿大贪污犯的战斗就普遍开展起来。
    经验证明，凡属大量地用钱、管物的机关，不论是党、政、军、民那一系统，必定有贪污犯，而且还隐藏有大贪污犯。北京市财经系统从一月十九日到二月七日为止的二十天中，就捕获大贪污犯八十五名，查出被贪污的金额约计一百七十亿元。在捕获的八十五名大贪污犯中，属于工商局系统的二十五名（到二月九日为止，工商局系统已捕获贪污、受贿一千万元以上的贪污犯九十四名，其中贪污、受贿一亿元以上的大贪污犯三十名），市建筑工程公司十二名，人民银行北京分行十四名，市税局
    （包括酒业公司）十三名，企业公司七名，公用局六名，永茂实业公司二名，市合作总社四名，财政局二名。过去，有人以为文化教育机关没有大老虎；但在这一阶段中，仅北京市各中等学校就已捉到贪污、受贿一亿元左右的“大老虎”六个。
    从已揭发的贪污案件来看，资产阶级三年来向国家向人民的进攻是十分猖狂的。许多国家工作人员的贪污案件，是和私商的勾引、腐蚀分不开的。多数贪污犯利用职务的方便和奸商相勾结，授受贿赂，纵使奸商偷漏税款、偷工减料、盗窃经济情报、扰乱市场，以牟取暴利；还有一些仓库保管人员集体和奸商相勾结，盗窃或盗卖国家资财；更有不少贪污分子本身就是混入的奸商或者是资产阶级派到国家机关的内奸。例如百货公司售货员何宏善，勾结私商提高收购价格，从中贪污。经他手和德记、鸿昌几家纸行的十七笔交易中，就使国家资财损失八亿五千万元。粮食公司储运股长孟学增被跑合商人刘常馨用请客吃饭种种办法所拉拢，竟在粮食公司买麻袋的一次交易中，让奸商刘常馨赚了一笔钱开设华馨木行，甚至粮食公司买枕木、订做高凳跳板等，招标比价，也让刘常馨把持。仅在一九五○年，刘常馨非法获取暴利六亿；孟学增接受的贿赂据已查明的有黄金九两、金戒子一个、银元百枚、手表三只、自行车一辆、西服料三码。粮食公司第三粮栈副经理马连瑞有组织有计划地盗窃了大量国家资财。如一九五一年，他和李克明
    （粮栈经理）共同主持召集李士奎、吕贵等干部七人开贪污会议，决议由李克明撑腰，马连瑞向城里倒卖，吕贵向城外盗卖，李士奎联络私商，白景和等三人过磅，就如此先后盗窃了国家粮食八十余万斤。中国人民银行北京分行外勤员常维廉是北京义昌、唐山复兴、开平立丰三家皮毛笔料庄的大股东，又是义昌的经理，一九五一年三月底混进人民银行北京分行后，假借人民银行干部名义，骗取中国畜产公司北京分公司的行情秘密，操纵垄断市场，和国营贸易公司对抗。该犯并利用职权在去年贷给庆丰厚皮毛货栈五亿一千万元，使庆丰厚垄断了北京市的羊毛市场。该号先后以次货倒卖给畜产公司羊毛总值九十八亿元，使公司损失五亿元以上。
    根据北京市一月来围攻大贪污犯的经验，要捕获大贪污分子首先必须组织力量，搜集和分析材料，有根据地确定“老虎”对象，同时领导干部必须有决心能放手发动群众，进行内外夹攻。
    现在北京市各单位已订出新的计划，继续捕捉大贪污分子。
