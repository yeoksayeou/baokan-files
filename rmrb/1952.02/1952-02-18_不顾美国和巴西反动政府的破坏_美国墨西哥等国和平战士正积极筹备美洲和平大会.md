Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: According to TASS, the American Preparatory Committee for the American Peace Congress recently issued a communique stating that, despite the Brazilian authorities prohibiting peace fighters from various American countries from convening the American Peace Congress in Rio de Janeiro, preparations for the congress are proceeding as usual.

The communique published a series of statements from various groups and progressive individuals in Latin American countries, reiterating their firm determination to convene the American Peace Congress. The First National Congress of the Mexican Confederation of Workers and Peasants, the Colombian Association of Democratic Legal Workers, the Colombian Workers' Confederation, the Catholic Workers' Confederation, the Panamanian Student Federation, and a group of prominent figures in Bolivia have all expressed their support for the Peace Congress and are preparing to send representatives to participate. The people of Peru have organized a preparatory committee to prepare for participation in the American Peace Congress. Various youth organizations in Brazil are scheduled to hold a National Youth Conference for the Defense of Peace on February 21st to elect representatives to participate in the American Peace Congress. To welcome this congress, peace fighters in Argentina have collected 3.9 million signatures for a declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

The American Preparatory Committee for the American Peace Congress believes that the Brazilian authorities' prohibition of the American Peace Congress was instigated by the United States government. It protested, saying: "We protest these actions of the United States government, which deliberately prevents the people of various American countries from freely exchanging views on how best to achieve peace." The American Preparatory Committee also urged various groups to continue to elect representatives to attend the American Peace Congress.

    不顾美国和巴西反动政府的破坏
    美国墨西哥等国和平战士正积极筹备美洲和平大会
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：美洲和平大会美国筹备委员会顷发表公报说：尽管巴西当局禁止美洲各国和平战士在里约热内卢召开美洲和平大会，但大会的筹备工作仍然照常进行。
    公报发表了来自拉丁美洲各国各团体和进步人士的一连串声明，这些声明再度表示坚决拥护召开美洲和平大会的决心。墨西哥工农总同盟第一次全国代表大会，哥伦比亚民主法律工作者协会、哥伦比亚工人联合会、天主教工人联合会，巴拿马学生联合会以及玻利维亚的一批著名人士都表示拥护和平大会并准备派遣代表参加。秘鲁人民已经组织了筹备委员会来筹备参加美洲和平大会事宜。巴西各青年组织定于二月二十一日举行全国青年保卫和平大会，以便选出参加美洲和平大会的代表。阿根廷的和平战士为了迎接这个大会，已经为要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言征集了三百九十万人的签名。
    美洲和平大会美国筹备委员会认为，巴西当局禁止召开美洲和平大会一事，是受美国政府指使的。它表示抗议说：“美国政府蓄意阻止美洲各国人民对于如何以最好的方法获得和平一事自由交换意见，我们抗议美国政府的这些行动。”美国筹备委员会并敦促各团体继续推选出席美洲和平大会的代表。
