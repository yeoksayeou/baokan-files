Reader's letter:

    The behavior of unscrupulous merchants exploiting the Volunteer Army
    is tantamount to helping the American aggressors
    
    Editor: In the past few days, I have discovered the following facts: Some illegal capitalists in Beijing are mixing a large amount of sand into the vegetables sold to comfort the Volunteer Army; even the rubber legs made for the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers are made of recycled rubber; when the Tianjin Lixing Egg Factory made egg powder for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they actually shorted each can by 1.5 to 3 taels of egg powder. These facts make me very angry! The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army is bravely and arduously fighting on the front lines of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in order to defend the happy lives of the people across the country; patriotic Chinese people are working hard in the rear, producing, working, and donating in order to support our dearest people. But profit-seeking illegal capitalists have lost the conscience that a Chinese person should have, and dare to steal from the materials that the motherland and the people are providing to support the Volunteer Army. Isn't this helping the American aggressors? The extremely ugly and reactionary behavior of illegal capitalists is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country, and to all patriotic workers and shop assistants. In order to actively support our dearest people, all patriotic people must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, resolutely struggle against illegal capitalists.

    奸商剥削志愿军的行为
    等于帮助了美国侵略者
    编辑同志：最近几天，我又发觉了以下几件事实：北京有违法的资本家，在卖给慰劳志愿军的菜里掺杂大量沙子；甚至为志愿军伤员制造的橡胶腿也用再生胶；天津利兴蛋厂为人民志愿军制蛋粉时，在每一桶罐头里竟少装蛋粉一两半至三两。这些事实使我十分愤怒！英勇的中国人民志愿军，为了保卫全国人民幸福的生活，在抗美援朝的最前线勇敢地、艰苦地作战；爱国的中国人民，为了支援我们最可爱的人，在后方努力地生产、工作和捐献。但唯利是图的不法资本家们竟丧尽一个中国人应有的天良，胆敢从祖国、从人民支援志愿军的物资里进行盗窃。这难道不是帮助了美国侵略者吗？不法资本家这种极端丑恶的、反动的行为是我们全国人民，全国爱国的工人、店员所绝对不能容忍的。为了积极支援我们最可爱的人，我们全体爱国的人民一定要在毛主席的领导下，坚决对不法资本家进行斗争。
