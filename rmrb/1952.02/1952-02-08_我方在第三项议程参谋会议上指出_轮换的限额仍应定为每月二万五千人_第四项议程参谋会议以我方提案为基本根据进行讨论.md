Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 7th: At the February 7th staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, our side, in an attempt to resolve the major differences of opinion between the two sides, pointed out that if the other side's suggestion limits the definition of military personnel rotation to military personnel who begin serving in Korea during the armistice period, excluding military personnel entering Korea for short-term leave and temporary assignments, then the rotation limit should still be set at 25,000 per month, which greatly increases the maximum limit on rotation in other respects. Our staff pointed out that since military personnel on short-term leave and temporary assignments are not included in the rotation limit, and their entry into Korea is not limited to specific ports agreed upon by both sides, the other side's objection to the number of three specific ports recommended by our side is even more untenable.

The staff meeting on the fourth agenda item held its first meeting today. The two sides exchanged views on the procedures for future work. The other side presented a partial working draft prepared mainly based on our proposal of February 3, and limited the discussion to the basic basis of our proposal of February 3.

After the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side's liaison officer requested a meeting with our liaison officer to admit that two aircraft from the other side violated the agreement by flying over the conference area at 11:20 am yesterday, and stated that they were investigating the incident. Our liaison officer stated that he had taken note of the other side's notification, and pointed out that it was very important to effectively prevent such incidents, and hoped that the other side would strictly restrain its actions.

    我方在第三项议程参谋会议上指出
    轮换的限额仍应定为每月二万五千人
    第四项议程参谋会议以我方提案为基本根据进行讨论
    【新华社开城七日电】二月七日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方为试图解决双方意见的主要分歧，指出如果对方的建议将军事人员轮换的定义限于停战期间开始进入朝鲜服役的军人，而不包括短期休假和担任临时任务的军事人员的进入朝鲜，则仍应将轮换的限额定为每月二万五千人，亦即在其他方面大大地增加了轮换的最高限额。我方参谋人员指出：既然短期休假和担任临时任务的军事人员不包括在轮换的限额内，其进入朝鲜亦不限于双方协议的特定口岸，则对方对于我方所建议的双方各设三个特定口岸的数目的反对意见，也就更加站不住脚。
    第四项议程参谋会议今天举行第一次会议。双方就今后进行工作的程序交换了意见。对方提出主要根据我方二月三日的提案而拟就的一部分工作草案，并限以我方二月三日的提案为基本的根据来进行讨论。
    第四项议程参谋会议后，对方联络官要求与我方联络官会晤，向我方承认昨日上午十一时二十分对方飞机两架违反协议飞越会场区上空，并谓正对该项事件进行调查。我方联络官表示对于对方的通知已予注意，并指出有效地制止此类事件十分重要，希望对方对其所为严加约束。
