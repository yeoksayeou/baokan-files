    American Military Families Don't Want Their Sons to Die for No Reason
    Demand Immediate Withdrawal of U.S. Troops Invading Korea
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The American people are protesting the U.S. government's use of their sons or relatives as cannon fodder in the war of aggression against Korea, demanding that American soldiers on the Korean battlefield be sent home as soon as possible.
    According to a report from the New York "Daily Worker" in Los Angeles on the 11th, the relatives of soldiers in the 40th Division of the U.S. National Guard, who were recently sent to the Korean battlefield, are very indignant. They wrote to Republican Senator Nixon of California, demanding that the soldiers in Korea be "sent home" "as soon as possible."
    The families of this division's soldiers also protested against "Congress passing any bill this year that would allow any National Guard unit to be sent abroad to perform so-called police duties." They accused the U.S. government of deception, because the soldiers who joined the National Guard had originally been told that they "would never be sent abroad to serve, not even to perform so-called police duties."

    美军家属不愿让儿子无缘无故死掉
    要求立即撤退侵朝美军
    【本报讯】新华社布拉格讯：美国人民抗议美国政府把他们的儿子或亲友充当侵朝战争的炮灰，要求把朝鲜战场的美国士兵尽早送回家来。
    据纽约“工人日报”洛杉矶十一日电称，最近被派到朝鲜战场去的美国国民警卫队第四十师的士兵的亲友们非常愤慨，他们写信给加利福尼亚州共和党参议员尼可逊，要求“尽早”把在朝鲜的士兵“送回家”。
    这一师军队的家属也提出抗议，反对“国会在今年通过允许派遣任何国民警卫队到外国去执行所谓警察职务的任何法案”。他们指责美国政府的骗人把戏，因为参加国民警卫队的士兵原来曾得到通知说，他们“决不会被派到外国去服役，甚至不去执行所谓警察职务”。
