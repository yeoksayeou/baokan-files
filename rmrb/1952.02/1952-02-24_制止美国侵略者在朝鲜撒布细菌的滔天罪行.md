    Stop the Heinous Crimes of the American Aggressors Spreading Bacteria in Korea

    I. The American Aggressor Forces Continuously Spread Bacteria in Korea

    Recently, the American aggressor forces have again continuously spread a large amount of bacteria in the Korean front and rear, attempting to slaughter the peaceful residents of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People’s forces on a large scale. From January 28th to February 17th, in the twenty days, American planes have dropped large quantities of small insects such as fleas, lice, and flies in Ichon, Cheorwon, Sibi-ri, Kimhwa, Pyonggang and other places in Korea eight times in a row. According to the preliminary laboratory results of our military medical department, these small insects contain plague bacilli, cholera bacteria, and other germs. The American aggressors, who have completely lost their humanity, want to use these small insects to spread various germs and slaughter the elderly, children, men, and women of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's armies on a large scale.

    The American aggressors have done this kind of large-scale slaughter of peaceful people more than once in order to save their military defeat on the battlefield, which they cannot save. The American aggressor forces' planes frantically bomb and strafe peaceful residents; repeatedly use poison gas bombs; and in December 1950, they spread a large amount of smallpox virus once. At that time, the American aggressor forces were being defeated and fleeing south from northern Korea by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. When the American aggressor forces fled Pyongyang, South Pyongan Province, North Pyongan Province, Gangwon Province, South Hamgyong Province, and Hwanghae Province, they spread a large amount of smallpox virus. Seven or eight days after the American army ran away from these places, a large number of smallpox patients were discovered. By April 1951, the number of patients had reached more than 3,500, and more than 300 people had died. To this day, the Korean people and the Korean-Chinese People's forces still hate the American aggressor forces for these heinous crimes.

    II. The American Aggressors Inhumanely Use Our Captured Personnel for Germ Experiments

    The American aggressors' bacteriological warfare to massacre peaceful people on a large scale has been prepared for a long time. According to the American "Life" magazine, the bacterial warfare department of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps stationed at Detrick Barracks in Maryland has long begun to study bacterial weapons. "Life" magazine shamelessly boasted that this bacterial warfare department has invented sixteen kinds of bacterial weapons that use air and water to spread and kill people in large numbers. The American aggressor bosses have also repeatedly stated that they will use bacterial weapons and atomic bombs.

    In Korea, the American aggressor forces inhumanely used captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean People's forces to conduct experiments on bacterial weapons. Last March, Brigadier General Sames, director of the "Health and Welfare Department" of the headquarters of the American aggressor forces commander Ridgway, led the No. 1091 bacterial landing craft to Wonsan Port and used captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers for bacterial weapons experiments. This executioner even received the "Cross Medal" for this. Soon, this evil ship sailed to Geoje Island near Busan and used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army for bacterial experiments. A telegram sent by an Associated Press reporter from Geoje Island on May 18 last year revealed some of the scenes of the American aggressor forces committing such heinous crimes. The reporter said: "The laboratory on the ship obtains cultures of mouth and stomach germs from the prisoner-of-war camps spread across Geoje Island and conducts 3,000 tests every day." As a result of these experiments, on the island "of the more than 125,000 North Korean prisoners held, 1,400 are seriously ill, and about 80 percent of the rest are infected with some kind of disease." After such "a series of laborious experiments, a disease has proven to be particularly toxic—often causing a large hole to 'open' in the patient's intestines."

    Such barbaric and brutal acts by the American aggressors in abusing captured personnel are intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world.

    III. Everyone Must Stop the Mad and Brutal Acts of the American Aggressors Who Collude with Japanese Bacterial War Criminals to Do Evil

    When preparing and manufacturing bacterial weapons, the American aggressors also employed Japanese bacterial war criminals who had massacred a large number of Chinese people. The Chinese people will never forget that when Japanese fascists occupied our territory, they established many bacterial killing factories in Harbin, Changchun, Anda in Heilongjiang, and other places, and spread plague bacteria in Ningbo and Jinhua in Zhejiang, Changde in Hunan, and Inner Mongolia, causing countless compatriots to suffer from disease and death. Some of these bacterial war criminals have been captured by the Soviet army. From December 25th to 30th, 1949, the Soviet Union interrogated twelve bacterial war criminals, including Yamada Otsuzo, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army and General of the Army, in the city of Khabarovsk, and sentenced them separately. This just measure by the Soviet Union was supported by peace-loving people all over the world and gave a powerful warning to other criminals preparing for bacterial warfare.

    When interrogating Yamada Otsuzo and others, the Soviet Union confirmed that Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Lieutenant General Medical Officer Shiro Ishii, Masazo Kitano, Veterinary Major General Jiro Wakamatsu, and Lieutenant General of the Army Yukio Kasahara were all heinous bacterial war criminals. Therefore, on February 1, 1950, the Soviet government sent a note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and our country, requesting the interrogation of these five bacterial war criminals. Our government and peace-loving people all over the world expressed warm support. However, the U.S. government has been protecting these Japanese bacterial war criminals and using them to prepare for bacterial warfare on a large scale. Three of these five major war criminals—Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano—are the accomplices sent to Korea by Ridgway's headquarters this time to engage in bacterial warfare.

    Everyone knows that prohibiting the use of bacterial weapons in combat is not only a just demand of mankind, but also stipulated in the Geneva Protocol "Concerning the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Toxic or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare," which was signed by the U.S. government itself on June 17, 1925. The fact that the American aggressors, disregarding the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, disregarding international law, and colluding with Japanese bacterial war criminals to openly commit such heinous crimes, proves that American imperialism has reached the end of its rope. The invading forces of the United States and its accomplices and puppets have lost more than 500,000 people in more than a year, lost more than 3,000 aircraft, and the army has been defeated by the Chinese and Korean People's forces. What "air superiority" has also gone bankrupt. After exhausting all kinds of crazy methods, the American aggressors used the most barbaric and shameless bacterial weapons. While they are delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, they are slaughtering peaceful people on a large scale with bacterial warfare, vainly attempting to save their failure that cannot be saved, but this despicable and inhuman act of madness can only further prove that the American aggressors are the deadly enemies of peaceful people all over the world, and can only further arouse the anger of the Chinese and Korean people, and further arouse the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world. No kind of combat method, including bacterial warfare, can save the failure of American imperialism, because the factors that determine the war are not weapons but the power of the people. Japanese imperialism also used bacterial weapons during the war of aggression against China, but it was still defeated by the powerful Chinese people. Our people throughout the country must continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, strengthen the struggle against corruption and theft, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in order to support our volunteers, strengthen national defense construction and economic construction, and more courageously strike at the American aggressors.

### 制止美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布细菌的滔天罪行

    制止美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布细菌的滔天罪行
    一、美国侵略军在朝鲜连续撒布细菌
    最近，美国侵略军又在朝鲜前线和后方连续撒布大量细菌，企图大规模地屠杀朝鲜的和平居民和中朝人民部队。从一月二十八日到二月十七日的二十天内，美国飞机在朝鲜的伊川、铁原、市边里、金化、平康等地一连八次撒下大批跳蚤、虱子、苍蝇等类小虫。根据我方军医部门的初步化验结果，这些小虫含有鼠疫菌、霍乱菌和其他病菌。完全失掉了人性的美国侵略者，想用这些小虫来传布各种病菌，大规模地杀害朝鲜的老人、小孩、男男女女和中朝人民军队。
    美国侵略者为了挽救它在战场上无法挽救的军事惨败，干这种大规模地屠杀和平人民的勾当已经不止一次了。美国侵略军的飞机疯狂地轰炸扫射和平居民；屡次使用毒气弹；一九五○年十二月，并曾大量地撒布过一次天花病毒。那时候，美国侵略军正从朝鲜北部被中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打得大败南逃。美国侵略军在逃离平壤市、平安南道、平安北道、江原道、咸镜南道、黄海道等地时，撒布下了大量天花病毒。这些地方在美国军跑了以后七、八天，就大量发现天花病患者，到一九五一年四月，患病的人曾达到三千五百多，并且死了三百多人。至今，朝鲜人民和朝中人民部队对美国侵略军这些滔天罪行，谈起来还切齿痛恨。
    二、美国侵略者惨无人道地用我方被俘人员来做细菌试验
    美国侵略者进行大规模地屠杀和平人民的细菌战争是作了长期准备的。据美国“生活”杂志透露，美国陆军化学兵团驻在马利兰州德第里克兵营的细菌作战部早已开始研究细菌武器。“生活”杂志无耻地夸耀说：这个细菌作战部已经发明了利用空气和水来散播大批杀害人民的十六种细菌武器。美国的侵略头子们也曾经屡次声言要使用细菌武器和原子弹。
    在朝鲜的美国侵略军，惨无人道地拿中朝人民部队被俘人员来做细菌武器的试验。去年三月，美国侵略军总司令李奇微总部的“卫生福利处”处长赛姆斯准将，曾经率领第一○九一号细菌登陆艇开到元山港，拿中国人民志愿军被俘人员来作细菌武器试验。这个刽子手竟因此而得到了“十字勋章”。不久，这艘万恶的船又开到了釜山附近的巨济岛，拿朝鲜人民军被俘人员来作细菌试验。美国通讯社美联社记者去年五月十八日从巨济岛发出的电报，曾经透露了美国侵略军干这种罪恶滔天的勾当时的一些情景。这个记者说：“船上的实验室从伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营取得口与肠胃的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验。”这样试验的结果，使岛上“关着的十二万五千多北朝鲜俘虏中，有一千四百人病得很厉害，其余的人约有百分之八十染有某种疾病。”经过这样“一连串的费力的试验，有一种病已经证明了毒性特别大——常常使病人的肠子‘打’开一个大洞。”
    美国侵略者这种虐杀被俘人员的野蛮残暴行为，是全世界爱好和平的人民所不能容许的。
    三、大家都来制止勾结日本细菌战犯作恶的美国侵略者的疯狂暴行
    美国侵略者在准备和制造细菌武器的时候，还起用了曾经大量屠杀中国人民的日本细菌战犯。中国人民永远不会忘记，日本法西斯在侵占我国领土时，曾在哈尔滨、长春、黑龙江的安达等地，成立许多细菌杀人工厂，并在浙江的宁波、金华，湖南的常德和内蒙古等地撒布鼠疫菌，使无数同胞遭受了疾病和死亡。这批细菌战犯中的一部分，已经被苏联军队擒获。苏联在一九四九年十二月二十五日到三十日，曾在伯力城审讯了前日本关东军总司令、陆军大将山田乙三等十二名细菌战犯，将他们分别判刑。苏联的这一正义措施，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的拥护，也给了其他准备作细菌战争的罪犯们一个有力的警告。
    苏联在审讯山田乙三等时，证实了日本天皇裕仁，中将医官石井四郎、北野政藏，少将兽医若松次郎和陆军中将笠原行雄等五人都是罪大恶极的细菌战犯，因此，苏联政府在一九五○年二月一日照会美国、英国和我国政府，要求审讯这五名细菌战犯。我国政府和全世界爱好和平的人民都表示热烈拥护。但美国政府一直庇护着这些日本细菌战犯，并且利用他们来大量准备细菌战争。这五名大战犯里面的三个人——石井四郎、若松次郎和北野政藏，就是被李奇微总部这次派到朝鲜去从事细菌战争的帮凶。
    大家知道，禁止使用细菌武器作战，不独是人类的正义要求，而且是一九二五年六月十七日美国政府自己签了字的“关于在战争中禁止使用窒息毒性及其他类似的毒瓦斯和细菌方法”的日内瓦协定所规定的。美国侵略者这样不顾全世界爱好和平人民的反对，不顾国际公法，而且和日本细菌战犯勾结起来公开做出这种滔天罪行，正说明了美帝国主义已经走上了穷途末路。美国及其帮凶和傀儡的侵略军一年多中损失了五十多万人，损失了三千多架飞机，陆军被中朝人民军队打败了，什么“空中优势”也破产了。在一切疯狂办法都想尽之后，美国侵略者就把最野蛮无耻的细菌武器使出来了。他们一面拖延朝鲜停战谈判、一面大规模地用细菌战屠杀和平人民，妄想以此来挽救他们无法挽救的失败，但是这种卑鄙的、惨无人道的疯狂行为，只能更加证明美国侵略者是全世界和平人民的死敌，只能更加激起中朝人民的愤怒，更加激起全世界爱好和平人民的反对。任何种类的作战方法，包括细菌作战在内，都不能挽救美帝国主义的失败，因为决定战争的因素不是武器而是人民的力量。日本帝国主义在侵华战争期间也曾使用过细菌武器，但它仍然被强大的中国人民打败了。我们全国人民一定要继续加强抗美援朝运动，加强反贪污，反盗窃的斗争，开展增产节约运动，以支援我们的志愿军，加强国防建设和经济建设工作，更加勇猛地打击美国侵略者。
