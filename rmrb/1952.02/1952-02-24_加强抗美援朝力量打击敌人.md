    Strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Force to Strike the Enemy

    To the Editor: The crimes of the invading American army in continuously airdropping bacteria and poisonous insects in Korea, in violation of humanitarianism and international law, arouse our boundless indignation. The American invading army's use of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals to conduct bacteriological warfare once again proves that the American imperialists are the most insidious and vicious deadly enemies of the Chinese people. This sinful conspiracy of American imperialism is bound to meet with utter failure and reap what it sows. We are determined to take practical actions to actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-bribery struggle, and strengthen the forces of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, to shatter all the arrogant and adventurous reckless actions of American imperialism.

    To the Editor: The heinous crimes of the American invading army in spreading bacteria have aroused the boundless anger of the railway workers in the Xizhimen area. The workers of the Xizhimen Engineering Equipment Maintenance and Repair Factory immediately organized discussions after seeing the newspaper. The flames of anger burned in everyone's heart. Everyone agreed: "It is impossible for American imperialism to use this inhuman and vicious means to save itself from its disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield. We are determined to crush this conspiracy of theirs." On the spot, thirty employees including Jin Yuanyuan and Wang Youtian, as well as Peng Xingde, a national railway model worker, all expressed their willingness to volunteer to go to Korea to strike at American imperialism. Many veteran workers also expressed their determination to do a good job in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, thoroughly eliminate corrupt elements, increase production, practice strict economy, and support our most beloved people.

    加强抗美援朝力量打击敌人
    编辑同志：侵朝美军违反人道和国际公法，在朝鲜接连地空投细菌毒虫的罪行，激起我们无比的愤恨。美国侵略军使用日本细菌战犯来进行细菌战争，再一次证明了美帝国主义者是中国人民最阴险最恶毒的死敌，美帝国主义这一罪恶阴谋是一定要遭到彻底失败并自食其果的。我们决心要以积极参加反贪污、反行贿斗争，加强抗美援朝力量的实际行动，来粉碎美帝国主义一切狂妄的冒险蠢动。

    编辑同志：美国侵略军撒布细菌的滔天罪行，激起了西直门地区铁路职工的无比愤怒。西直门工务机具保养修配厂的工人看到报纸后，马上便组织讨论，愤怒的火焰，燃烧着每个人的心。大家一致认为：“美帝国主义想用这种灭绝人性的恶毒手段，挽救在朝鲜战场上的惨败是不可能的，我们有决心粉碎他这种阴谋。”当场，金玉元、王有田等三十个职工和全国铁路劳动模范彭兴德，都表示愿意志愿赴朝，打击美帝国主义。许多老年工友也表示一定要把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动搞好，彻底肃清贪污分子，增加生产，厉行节约，支援我们最可爱的人。
