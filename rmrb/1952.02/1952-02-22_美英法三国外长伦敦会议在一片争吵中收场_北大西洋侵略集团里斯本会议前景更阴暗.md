Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The conference of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France was held in London from the 17th to the 19th. On the 18th and 19th, Adenauer, the premier of the West German puppet government, was also summoned to attend the meeting. The meeting failed to reach any important agreement on the issue of the fierce disputes surrounding the arming of West Germany, thus making the prospects for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Lisbon starting on the 20th even bleaker.

This foreign ministers' conference was held in a situation where the U.S.'s war preparation policy in Western Europe was in serious crisis. Since the West German reactionaries, with the support of the United States, launched a fierce dispute with France over the Saar issue and manipulated the Bonn parliament to put forward arrogant conditions for joining the European Army, the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries on the issue of arming West Germany have become apparent. This U.S. policy of supporting West German reactionaries in attacking Western European countries has been resisted by the ruling groups in France and Britain. On the eve of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, the issue of France's participation in the European Army caused a very fierce debate in the French National Assembly. The Faure government, which demanded that the parliament approve participation in the European Army, was in a precarious situation throughout the London conference. It was not until the closing day of the London conference that the parliament barely passed the motion of confidence in Faure and the Faure government's revised and conditionally attached plan to participate in the European Army.

Under the shadow of this serious political atmosphere in Western Europe, although the United States tried its best to eliminate the disputes between the United States, West Germany, and France and Britain on the issue of arming West Germany at the foreign ministers' conference in order to remove obstacles for the subsequent Lisbon conference, the foreign ministers' conference was still filled with quarrels. According to the Associated Press, fierce quarrels broke out between French Foreign Minister Schuman and Adenauer at the meetings on the mornings and afternoons of the 18th. The United States even threatened France that if it did not participate in the European Army, it would proceed to arm West Germany alone and reduce "aid" to France to coerce France into making concessions, but the Associated Press said that France's attitude in the meeting was still "quite tough". Apart from reaching an agreement on the issue of releasing Nazi war criminals, the meeting failed to reach a final agreement on any important issue. The vaguely worded communiqué issued at the end of the meeting tried to conceal the failure of the meeting, but even the Associated Press London dispatch on the 19th pointed out: "Such an empty communiqué does not explain how the demands of Germany and the determination of France are reconciled... The fact that both the West German Parliament and the French National Assembly have passed resolutions to participate in the European Army, but also attached opposing conditions, seems to contradict the optimism expressed in the communiqué."

Such an ending to the foreign ministers' conference has made the public opinion of the North Atlantic Group countries increasingly pessimistic about the Lisbon conference. According to a Dentsu News Agency London dispatch on the 18th, British newspapers have a dimmer view of the prospects for the Lisbon conference than before the opening of the foreign ministers' conference. The "Daily Telegraph" editorial said: "For the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Lisbon, it is difficult to imagine a more discouraging prelude than the debate on the European Army issue in Paris (French National Assembly), or the nerve-wracking discussions in London between Adenauer and the foreign ministers of the three major countries attending the Lisbon conference." Even the USIS Lisbon dispatch on the 18th said: "Officials involved in North Atlantic Treaty affairs do not expect the Lisbon conference to make any 'world-shaking' decisions."

### 美英法三国外长伦敦会议在一片争吵中收场  北大西洋侵略集团里斯本会议前景更阴暗

    美英法三国外长伦敦会议在一片争吵中收场
    北大西洋侵略集团里斯本会议前景更阴暗
    【新华社二十一日讯】美、英、法三国外长会议已于十七日至十九日在伦敦举行。在十八、十九两日，西德傀儡政府总理阿登纳也被召参加会议。会议结果未能在环绕着武装西德所发生的激烈争吵的问题上获得任何重要协议，因而已使二十日起在里斯本举行的北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议的前景更加阴暗。
    这次外长会议是在美国在西欧的备战政策陷于严重危机的形势下举行的。自西德反动派在美国支持下展开了与法国关于萨尔问题的激烈争吵，并操纵波恩议会提出参加欧洲军的狂妄条件以后，美国与西欧国家间在武装西德问题上的矛盾已趋表面化。美国这种扶植西德反动派向西欧各国进攻的政策，遭到法国和英国统治集团的反抗。在伦敦外长会议前夕，法国参加欧洲军问题就在法国国民议会中引起了十分激烈的辩论。要求议会批准参加欧洲军的富尔政府，在伦敦会议期间一直是处于风雨飘摇之中。直到伦敦会议闭幕的一天，议会才勉强通过了对富尔的信任案和富尔政府经过修改并附有条件的参加欧洲军计划。
    在西欧这种严重的政治气氛的笼罩下，美国虽然竭力要在外长会议中消除美国、西德以及法、英两国间在武装西德问题上的争吵，来为接着举行的里斯本会议排除障碍，但是在外长会议中依然是一片争吵声。据合众社透露，在十八日上午及下午会议上，法国外交部长舒曼和阿登纳之间都展开了激烈的争吵。美国甚至以法国如不参加欧洲军就将迳行单独武装西德并削减对法国的“援助”来胁迫法国，要法国让步，但是合众社说，法国在会议中态度仍“颇为强硬”。会议除对释放纳粹战犯问题获致协议外，在任何重要问题上都未能获得最后协议。会议结束时所发表的含糊其辞的公报力图掩饰这次会议的失败，然而连美联社伦敦十九日电也指出：“这样一个空洞的公报并没有说明德国的要求和法国的决心是怎样调解的……。西德议会和法国国民议会固然都通过参加欧洲军，可是也都附上了反面的条件，这样一个事实，就和公报中所表示的乐观情绪，似乎是互相抵触的。”
    外长会议这样的结局，使得北大西洋集团国家的舆论对里斯本会议的估计是越发悲观了。据电通社伦敦十八日电报道：英国报纸对于里斯本会议的前途的看法，已较外长会议开幕以前更为暗淡。“每日电讯报”的社论说：“对在里斯本举行的北大西洋公约组织会议说来，再难以想像有比巴黎（法国国民议会）的欧洲军问题的辩论，或者在伦敦举行的阿登纳与里斯本会议的三个主要国家的外长之间的伤脑筋的讨论，更为令人气馁的前奏曲了。”甚至美国新闻处里斯本十八日电也在说：“和北大西洋公约事务有关系的官员们，预料这次里斯本会议不会作出什么‘震撼世界’的决定。”
