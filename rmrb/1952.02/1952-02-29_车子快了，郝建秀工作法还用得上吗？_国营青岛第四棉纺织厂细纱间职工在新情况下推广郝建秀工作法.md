    With Faster Machines, Is the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Still Useful?
    ——Workers in the Fine Spinning Workshop of the State-Owned Qingdao No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory Promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Under New Circumstances
    Workers in the fine spinning workshop of the State-Owned Qingdao No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory recently overcame the erroneous idea that "with faster machines, the Hao Jianxiu work method is no longer useful," enabling the promotion of this work method under new circumstances.
    In January of this year, after the front roller speed of the factory's spinning machines increased to 250 revolutions, output increased, but roller lapping waste surged from 0.7 percent to over 1 percent. As a result, many administrative cadres and workers doubted: "With faster machines, is the Hao Jianxiu work method still useful?" "Does the Hao Jianxiu work method require certain conditions?" Some workers felt that although the Hao Jianxiu work method was good, it was unusable with the faster machines.
    In order to solve this problem, the factory administration organized an inspection team. This inspection revealed that although the machines were faster and the raw cotton was relatively poor (in January, lower-grade cotton accounted for 50 percent of the raw cotton used by the No. 4 Factory), the roller lapping waste of nearly 15 percent of the fine spinning workers had not increased significantly. The roller lapping waste rates of Shi Xiulan, Yuan Xiumei, Zhang Guilan, and others were all below 0.4 percent, and Zhang Guilan was once known for "releasing waste." Based on these findings, the No. 4 Factory conducted typical measurements and analyzed the operations of several outstanding workers. As a result, they discovered the following characteristics: (1) Mastering new situations and new rules. When the machines were slow, workers considered distance and priority when piecing broken ends, paying little attention to broken end fly waste. However, with faster machines, the wind force is greater, and broken end fly waste can break other yarns, causing more broken ends, so it is necessary to first piece such broken ends. This is what Shi Xiulan does. Also, when the machines are slow, one patrol allows the roving to spin more than one revolution, but when the machines are fast, it is necessary to spin two revolutions. When changing the roving, Shi Xiulan and others mastered this new rule, so they could avoid empty spindles. Those who apply the set of actions and habits from when the machines ran at 180 revolutions to when they run at 250 revolutions will naturally feel that the Hao Jianxiu work method is unusable. (2) Actively strive for time and do more cleaning work. When the machines are faster, the piecing work increases, which inevitably takes up time for cleaning work. Therefore, in order to ensure that cleaning work is done well, it is necessary to find ways to squeeze out more time in other work. In the past, when the machines were slow, Yuan Xiumei would change the roving tube when there were five or six rounds of yarn left. After the machines sped up, she would wait until there were only one or two rounds left before changing. This saves some time for cleaning work. Those who say that the Hao Jianxiu work method is unusable are busy piecing broken ends and no longer think of ways to do more cleaning work, so naturally there are more broken ends.
    The results of the inspection prove that many Hao Jianxiu workers in the No. 4 Factory, who were previously considered to have good results, have not been able to deeply and actively grasp the rules and basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method, so when they encounter changes in the situation, they feel unable to cope and instead say that the Hao Jianxiu work method is not good. Now, many Hao Jianxiu workers in the No. 4 Factory have realized this shortcoming. They said: "In the past, we used the Hao Jianxiu work method too rigidly, and we must change it in the future." They are all prepared to further implement the Hao Jianxiu work method in fine spinning work under the new circumstances.

    车子快了，郝建秀工作法还用得上吗？
    ——国营青岛第四棉纺织厂细纱间职工在新情况下推广郝建秀工作法
    国营青岛第四棉纺织厂细纱间职工最近克服了“车子快了，郝建秀工作法用不上了”的错误思想，使这一工作法在新情况下得以推广。
    今年一月份，这个厂的细纱机前罗拉速度增加到二五○转后，产量提高了，但皮辊花却从百分之零点七激增至百分之一以上。因此，不少行政干部和职工就怀疑：“车子快了，郝建秀工作法还用得上吗？”“郝建秀工作法是不是需要一定条件的呢？”有的工人感觉到郝建秀工作法虽好，但车子加快了想用也用不上了。
    为了解决这个问题，工厂行政方面就组织检查组进行检查。这次检查发现，虽然车子加快了，原棉也比较不好（四厂一月份和花成分下级棉占百分之五十），但仍有近百分之十五的细纱工人的皮辊花并未增加很多。石秀兰、袁秀美、章桂兰等人的皮辊花率都在百分之零点四以下，其中章桂兰过去还是以“放花”出名的。根据这些发现，四厂又进行了典型测定，对几个成绩优秀的工人的操作作了分析。结果，发现她们有如下的特点：（一）掌握新情况、新规律。车子慢时，工人接断头时考虑的是远近和先后，不大注意断头飞花。可是车子快了，风力大，断头飞花会打断其他线纱，造成更多的断头，所以就必须首先接这样的断头。石秀兰就是这样做的。又如车子慢时，巡回一次，粗纱纺一圈多，车子快了便要纺两圈。石秀兰等人在换粗纱时，掌握了这个新规律，所以能不出空锭子。那些把车子一百八十转时的一套动作习惯用在二百五十转上面的人，当然便要感到郝建秀工作法用不上了。（二）主动争取时间，多做清洁工作。在车子加快时，接头工作增多，多少要占用清洁工作的时间，因此，为了保证做好清洁工作，必须设法在其他工作中挤出更多的时间。袁秀美在过去车子慢时，是当粗纱管还剩五、六圈纱时就去换，车子增快以后，她便等到只剩一两圈再换。这样就省下些时间来做清洁工作。那些说郝建秀工作法用不上的人，都忙于接断头，再不去想办法多做清洁工作，自然断头就更多了。
    检查的结果证明，四厂许多被认为成绩很好的郝建秀工作者，过去一直没能深刻地和主动地掌握郝建秀工作法的规律和基本精神，所以遇见情况变化时便感到无法对付，反说郝建秀工作法不好用了。现在四厂的不少郝建秀工作者已经认识到这一缺点，他们说：“过去我们运用郝建秀工作法太死啦，今后一定改。”他们都准备在新情况下进一步把郝建秀工作法贯彻到细纱工作中去。
