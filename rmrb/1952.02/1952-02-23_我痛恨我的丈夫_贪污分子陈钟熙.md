    I Hate My Husband – Embezzler Chen Zhongxi
    I hate my husband – Chen Zhongxi, an embezzler from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.
    Chen Zhongxi joined the workforce after liberation. After more than two years of study and transformation, he still hasn't made any progress. Chen Zhongxi has consistently lived a corrupt life, deceiving the organization and deceiving me. After embezzling, he spent his days drinking and whoring, shamelessly degenerating. He has not realized that he is participating in the great revolutionary work and is a cadre of the People's Government. He still lives his life with the attitude of the old society. In the past, I always thought that if a man had improper behavior outside, it was just "playing the field," and it was enough if he took some care of the family. Now, thanks to Chairman Mao's education, my awareness has increased. The extent to which I hate him is the same as the extent to which the people who love the motherland hate him.
    Chen Zhongxi, he is a criminal of the people, and I hope the People's Government will give him a severe punishment. Xiao Dexi

    我痛恨我的丈夫——贪污分子陈钟熙
    我痛恨我的丈夫——中央人民政府农业部的贪污分子陈钟熙。
    陈钟熙是在解放后参加工作的，经过两年多的学习和改造，他仍然没有什么进步。陈钟熙一贯生活腐化，欺骗组织，也欺骗我。他贪污后，成天喝酒、嫖妓，无耻地堕落下去。他没有认识到自己是参加了伟大的革命工作，是人民政府的一个干部。他仍然用旧社会的态度过日子。过去，我总认为男人在外面有不轨的行动，只不过是“逢场作戏”，他有一部分心照顾家就算了。现在，由于毛主席对我的教育，我的觉悟提高了。我痛恨他的程度，就和热爱祖国的人民痛恨他的一样。
    陈钟熙，他是人民的罪犯，我希望人民政府给他以严厉的处分。萧德喜
