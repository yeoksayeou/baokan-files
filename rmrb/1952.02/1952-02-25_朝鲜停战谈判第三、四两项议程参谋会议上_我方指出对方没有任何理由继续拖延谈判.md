Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 24th. At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 24th, our side solemnly pointed out that our side had already proposed a completely reasonable compromise solution of a monthly rotation limit of 35,000 people and five specific ports on each side. The other side had no reason to continue delaying on these two issues. Since the other side also had to admit that the neutral nations proposed by our side fully conformed to the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both sides, there was even less reason to oppose our side's nomination of neutral nations. Our side once again demanded that the other side withdraw its unreasonable opposition to the neutral nations proposed by our side, and suggested that both sides simultaneously and at once agree to the other side's full nomination of neutral nations, or, according to Article 38 of the draft agreement proposed by the other side itself, each side nominate three neutral nations that meet the definition, without any agreement procedures at all.
    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, our staff members pointed out that at the current stage of the discussion on the fourth agenda item, the other side no longer had any reason to insist on rejecting our side's fair and reasonable principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war, and only by facing this issue and accepting our side's principle can the problem be solved. If one only attempts to circumvent the issue with ambiguous wording in other clauses, it is simply putting the cart before the horse and can absolutely not solve the problem.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三、四两项议程参谋会议上
    我方指出对方没有任何理由继续拖延谈判
    【新华社开城二十四日电】二十四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方严正指出，我方已经提出了每月三万五千人的轮换限额和每方五个特定口岸的完全合理的折衷方案，对方没有任何理由在这两个问题上继续拖延。既然对方也不得不承认我方所提出的中立国家都是完全符合于双方协议的中立国的定义的，就更没有任何理由反对我方对于中立国家的提名。我方再次要求对方撤消对于我方所提出的中立国家的无理反对，建议双方同时并一次同意对方对于中立国家的全部提名，或者根据对方自己提出的协定草案三十八款规定，双方各提三名符合定义的中立国，根本不进行同意手续。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋人员指出：第四项议程讨论到现阶段，对方已没有任何理由再坚持拒绝我方的无条件释放并遣返全部战俘的公平合理的原则，并且只有面对这一问题，接受我方原则，才能解决问题。如果只是企图在其他条款中用模棱两可的辞句来规避问题，便只是舍本逐末，绝对不能解决问题。
