    The Glorious Deeds of Model Telegraph Operator Comrade Chen Yan Educated Me

    Editor: The article "Wartime Model Telegraph Operator Chen Yan," a returning representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, published in the People's Daily on January 22nd, deeply educated and inspired me. I used her heroic deeds as a mirror to compare myself, and felt extremely ashamed. I am also a people's telegraph operator, but for the past three years, I have adopted a dismissive and irresponsible attitude towards the people's telegraph work, which has resulted in many mistakes in my work. Sometimes I don't get up on time, thus missing the liaison time for work and missing the shift; sometimes I copy and send the wrong telegrams, register the wrong work diaries, and work carelessly, and often lose my temper; when I do a little more work, I say the work is too heavy, and I feel dizzy and my legs hurt. I once thought: If this continues for a long time, it will affect my health, so I should ask the leadership to adjust my work. I only selfishly thought about myself, and never thought about how the volunteers were bravely and arduously defending peace on the front lines in Korea, and how the people of the whole country were working hard to build their own country. This is a serious manifestation of individualism. From now on, I will take Comrade Chen Yan's model deeds as a mirror for myself, constantly look for shortcomings in my work, and resolutely overcome them.

    模范报务员陈炎同志的光荣事迹教育了我
    编辑同志：一月二十二日人民日报登载的志愿军归国代表“战地模范报务工作者陈炎”一文，深深地教育了我，鼓舞了我。我把她的英勇事迹当作一面镜子和自己对照了一下，感到无限惭愧。我也是
    一个人民的报务工作者，但是三年来我对于人民的报务工作却采取了轻视和不负责任的态度，因此在工作上发生了不少的错误。有时我不按时间起床，因而错过了上班的联络时间而误了班；有时抄发错了电报，登记错了工作日记，工作不认真，还常大发脾气；多搞了一点工作，就说工作太重，感到头晕、腿疼。我曾想：这样长久下去，就会影响自己的健康，还是请求领导上调一下工作吧。我只这样自私地想着自己，而从来没有想到志愿军在朝鲜前线如何艰苦勇敢地保卫着和平，全国人民都在努力地建设着自己的国家。这是严重的个人主义表现。今后我要把陈炎同志的模范事迹当作自己的一面镜子，经常寻找自己工作上的缺点，并坚决克服它。
