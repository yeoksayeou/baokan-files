To the Editors:

    We are the employees of the Central Typewriter Company. We firmly support the People's Government's arrest of Wu Runmin, the manager of the Central Typewriter Company and a profiteering merchant, and we suggest that the government severely punish him.

    In the past, we lived in the shop of the profiteering merchant Wu Runmin, daring to be angry but not daring to speak. When the inspection team came, we finally broke through all concerns, provided clues, collected materials, and assisted the inspection team in its work. Now we have all joined the trade union. Under the class education of the trade union, we have united. Under the leadership of the trade union, we actively participated in the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement. In just a few days, we have investigated and forced the capitalist to report to the government more than two hundred million yuan of hidden property (the capitalist has not fully reported). On February 14th, we held a face-to-face reasoning session with the capitalist (the female shopkeeper) at the counter. We pointed out on the spot that an off-the-books electric computer belonging to Central Typewriter Company located somewhere in Shanghai had never been declared. On the afternoon of February 7th, when we investigated relevant materials between our company and the Nanjing Typewriter Company with the employees of the Nanjing Typewriter Company, the Nanjing Typewriter Company's capitalist (profiteering merchant) called us several times, threatening us, and also said that he was a "member of the inspection team," etc.

    We guarantee to our fellow shop assistants in the city that we will fight the illegal capitalists to the end. We demand that the government punish the capitalists who hide funds and the capitalists who threaten shop assistants.

    北京中央打字机行全体职工
    和资方开面对面的说理会
    揭发资方隐藏不报的资产
    编辑同志：我们是中央打字机行的职工。我们坚决拥护人民政府逮捕中央打字机行经理奸商吴润民，并建议政府严厉惩办他。
    过去我们在奸商吴润民的商店里，过着敢怒而不敢言的生活。当检查组来的时候，我们终于打破了一切顾虑，供给线索、搜集材料，协助检查组进行工作。现在我们都加入了工会，在工会的阶级教育下，我们团结起来了。在工会的领导下，我们积极地参加了反行贿、反偷税漏税运动。几天工夫，我们已查出并迫使资方向政府补报了隐藏的二亿多元财物（资方并未补报完全）。二月十四日，我们在柜上和资方（女掌柜）开了一个面对面的说理会，我们当场指出中央打字机行存在上海某处的一架账外电动计算机一直没有申报。二月七日下午，我们向南京打字机行职工调查本行和该行间的有关材料时，南京打字机行资方（奸商）数次给我们打电话，威胁我们，还说他是“检查组”等等。
    我们向全市店员同志们保证：我们一定向不法资本家斗争到底。我们要求政府惩处隐藏资金的资本家和威胁店员的资本家。
