    Statement by the Returning Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Angrily Protesting the American Bandits' Use of Bacteriological Warfare
    Expressing Determination and Strength to Crush All Enemy Conspiracies
    [Our Newspaper] The Returning Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a statement, strongly protesting the American aggressor troops' conduct of bacteriological warfare, and demanding that the people of the world impose sanctions. The statement reads in part:
    With boundless rage and indignation, we accuse the people of the whole nation and the people of the whole world, demanding that the people of the whole nation and the whole world jointly condemn and sanction the inhumane American aggressors. They have completely violated human justice and international law, and on the Korean front and in the rear, have openly and on a large scale used bacteriological weapons against the peaceful residents of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. This heinous crime of the American aggressor troops proves that the American aggressors are the most ferocious and ruthless public enemy of mankind in human history; the hideous features of the American aggressors are even more completely exposed before the people of the world. We must not tolerate an enemy that is so crazy, shameless, and brutal!
    We accuse with rage and indignation! The American aggressor troops' large-scale use of bacteriological weapons against our Chinese and Korean People's troops and the Korean people fully proves that the enemy is attempting to use this atrocity to salvage its military defeat on the Korean battlefield, which it can no longer salvage. The Korean armistice negotiations, which are evident to all, have not reached a proper agreement to this day because of the enemy's repeated delays and sabotage. While negotiating, the enemy has launched attacks against us, large and small, thousands of times. As early as last year, during the enemy's self-proclaimed "Autumn Offensive," they adopted all kinds of most shameless methods. For example, in the battle of Tiande Mountain, the enemy used heavy artillery fire to cover continuous fierce attacks on us for four days, and the enemy paid the price of nearly a thousand people but still failed to advance a single step; finally, they even released poison gas, but the result was still that they were repelled by our army. On the Korean battlefield, the crimes of the American aggressor troops that we have personally witnessed are too numerous to record. We have repeatedly exposed and warned the American aggressors: all the blood debts they have created must be repaid in blood. But the extremely arrogant enemy, recklessly defying the great disapproval of the world, not only sinfully used a large number of our captured personnel as victims of experimental bacteriological weapons, but now dares to use bacteriological weapons on a large scale. All this can more fully prove that the enemy's purpose in delaying and sabotaging the negotiations is to prepare for even more arrogant offensives.
    We accuse with rage and indignation! This sinful atrocity of the enemy has not only been prepared for a long time and has a huge manufacturing organization, but it is also being carried out in collusion with the Japanese bacteriological war criminals who are enemies of the Chinese and Korean people. Japanese imperialism once used bacteria to massacre the Chinese people on a large scale, attempting to destroy China; but it was Japanese imperialism itself that died. This atrocity of the American aggressor troops is bound to fail in the same way, and a fate of death awaits it.
    We accuse with rage and indignation! This inhumane and extremely vicious act of bacteriological warfare by the American aggressors proves that they are extremely hostile to the desire for peace of the people of the world and to the interests of all mankind. These merchants of death who slaughter vast numbers of human beings are the mortal enemies of all peace-loving people, and the mortal enemies of human justice, civilization, and security.
    This most barbarous means of the American aggressor troops will never frighten our People's Volunteer Army. On the contrary, it can only deepen our hatred for the enemy a hundredfold, infinitely strengthen our combat power, and make us more vigilant against all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks! In more than a year of combat in Korea, our People's Volunteer Army, in coordination with the Korean People's Army, has smashed all the enemy's offensive conspiracies and dealt them a severe blow. We have experienced all kinds of enemy weapons, including its so-called naval and air superiority and the repeatedly used poison gas that has failed, and we are determined and have the strength to crush this most vicious conspiracy of bacteriological warfare of the enemy. We must pay close attention to the expansion of this conspiracy of the enemy, act more resolutely, and fight to the end to safeguard human justice, fairness, security, and civilization. We will use the most severe punishment to sanction the American aggressors who manufacture and use bacteriological weapons! Victory will surely belong to us!

    中国人民志愿军归国代表团发表声明
    愤怒抗议美国强盗使用细菌作战
    并表示有决心有力量粉碎敌人的一切阴谋
    【本报讯】中国人民志愿军归国代表团发表声明，严重抗议美国侵略军进行细菌战争，要求全世界人民予以制裁。声明略称：
    我们以无比的震怒和愤恨的心情向全国人民和全世界人民控诉，要求全国和全世界人民共同声讨和制裁灭绝人性的美国侵略者。它们完全违反了人类的正义和国际公法，在朝鲜前线和后方，向着朝鲜和平居民与中朝人民军队，公然大规模地使用了细菌武器。美国侵略军这种令人发指的滔天罪行，证明了美国侵略者是人类历史上最凶恶最狠毒的人类公敌；美国侵略者的狰狞面目在世界人民面前更加暴露无遗。对疯狂、无耻、残暴到如此程度的敌人，我们绝不能容忍！
    我们震怒、愤恨地控诉！美国侵略军对我中朝人民部队和朝鲜人民大量施用细菌武器，完全证明了敌人妄图用这种暴行来挽救它在朝鲜战场上早已无法挽救的军事惨败。举世共睹的朝鲜停战谈判，因为敌人的一再拖延和破坏，至今未能达成应有的协议。敌人一面谈判，一面向我发动大小千百次的攻击。早在去年敌人所吹嘘的“秋季攻势”中，它们就采用了各种最无耻的办法，如在天德山战斗中，敌人以大量炮火掩护连续向我猛攻四天，敌人付出近千人的代价仍未能前进一步；最后竟施放毒瓦斯，但结果仍为我军击退。我们在朝鲜战场上，亲眼看见的美国侵略军的罪行，早已罄竹难书。我们曾一再地揭露和警告美国侵略者：它所造成的一切血债一定要拿血来偿还。但是狂妄已极的敌人，悍然甘冒天下之大不韪，不仅罪恶地大批以我方被俘人员做了试验细菌武器的牺牲品，现在，竟敢大规模地施用起细菌武器来，这一切更可完全证明敌人拖延和破坏谈判的目的就是为了准备更狂妄的进攻。
    我们震怒、愤恨地控诉！敌人这种罪恶的暴行，不但经过了长期准备、有着庞大的制造机构，而且是与中朝人民为敌的日本细菌战犯勾结进行的。日本帝国主义曾用细菌来大规模屠杀中国人民，企图灭亡中国；但死亡的是日本帝国主义本身；美国侵略军这种暴行，同样必然失败，死亡命运在等待着它。
    我们震怒、愤恨地控诉！美国侵略者这种灭绝人性、穷凶极恶进行细菌战的暴行，证明了它对于全世界人民要求和平的愿望，及全人类的利益是极端仇视的。这种屠杀广大人类的死亡贩子，是一切爱好和平人民的死敌，是人类正义、文明和安全的死敌。
    美国侵略军这种最野蛮的手段，绝吓不住我们人民志愿军，相反地只能使我们百倍加深了对敌人的愤恨，无限增强了我们战斗的力量，使我们更加警惕敌人的一切阴谋鬼计！我们人民志愿军，在朝鲜一年多的作战中，配合朝鲜人民军，已粉碎了敌人一切进攻阴谋，并给以严重的打击。我们经历了敌人的各种武器，包括它的所谓海空优势和一再使用均遭失败的毒瓦斯在内，我们也有决心有力量来粉碎敌人这一最毒辣的细菌战的阴谋。我们一定要严密地注意敌人这一阴谋的扩大，更坚决地行动起来，为维护人类的正义、公道、安全、文明而奋斗到底，我们要用最严厉的惩办来制裁制造和施用细菌武器的美国侵略者！胜利一定属于我们！
