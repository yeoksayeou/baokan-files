Capitalist of Daye Construction Factory Steals Materials
Once Stealing Up to 2 Billion Yuan

Editor: The Beijing Institute of Technology is building a school building in the western suburbs called the "Yan'an Building," with a construction cost of over 17 billion yuan. This project was contracted to the Daye Construction Factory. The manager of this factory is a treacherous merchant. He does not act according to the contract, uses inferior goods in place of good ones, substitutes fake for genuine, steals materials, and seeks exorbitant profits. For example, the roof sheathing should have been made of red pine, but he used box boards corroded by cement. The treacherous merchant calls this "saving." The treacherous merchant stole cement formwork worth 1.2 billion yuan, and most of the 800 million yuan in management fees. This "Yan'an Building" is not yet completed, but it is already riddled with holes and on the verge of collapse. For example, the foundation is not compacted according to specifications and has begun to sink. Some wall cracks are as long as one meter, and the brick seam width exceeds the contractual requirements by seven times. The beams have been propped up with pillars. Cement falls off at the slightest touch. More than ninety steel windows are broken. The roof leaks when it rains. According to preliminary inspections, more than 2 billion yuan has already been wasted. The completion date is still far away, and this loss is even more difficult to estimate. Now, the People's Government has arrested the manager of the Daye Construction Factory, and we demand that he be held accountable for all losses and severely punished.

Shop Assistant Xia Yongrui Overcomes Concerns and Exposes Treacherous Merchant

Editor: I am an apprentice at Beijing Zhongde Pharmacy. The manager of Zhongde Pharmacy is a treacherous merchant. He has consistently evaded taxes and sold drugs. He treats the shop assistants very harshly. He once fired Cao Shichang, a shop assistant with fourteen years of service, who was so angered that he went blind and died. He often gave me small favors, which turned me into his tail. He bought a batch of red wine and then evaded taxes to sell it. After being investigated, he was required to pay more than 6 million yuan in back taxes. Under his instructions, I told the person in charge of the wine monopoly company that the store had no money. Therefore, he has not paid this money to this day. I betrayed the working class in this way. When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement started, the store's trade union organized and mobilized me, but I had ideological concerns. I was afraid of being prosecuted for helping the treacherous merchant evade taxes, and I was also afraid of losing my job. I was restless every day and did not want to eat. After participating in the first shop assistant representative meeting, I understood the government's policy. My mind cleared, and I wanted to wash my hands and return to my own ranks. Therefore, I revealed all of my store manager's crimes—smuggling more than 500 million yuan in foreign exchange, evading 1.2 billion yuan in taxes, selling drugs, possessing large quantities of opium and heroin, bribing cadres, and making fake medicines—more than forty incidents, without reservation.

Treacherous Merchant Hao Jin Bribes Cadres and Steals State Property and Should be Severely Punished

Editor: Hao Jin, the deputy manager of Beijing Private Xin Dongbei Construction Factory, is a treacherous merchant who bribes cadres and steals state property. He has bribed cadres in various parts of the country, about fifty people or more. Wang Fulou, a staff member of a certain department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, was dragged into the water by him. In July of last year, he used deceptive and manipulative means to get Wang Fulou to steal the bid price for a construction project for him, and thus won the bid. He gave Wang Fulou 80 million yuan. In August, he sent 10 million yuan to Wang's home, wanting to buy over Wang's wife in order to take advantage of Wang Fulou to further steal materials and seek exorbitant profits. The wealth he stole on the construction project of a certain department is impossible to calculate. Hao Jin's illegal activities are very serious, and I demand that the government severely punish him.

The Salvage Project of the "Baoshen" Dredger Should Be Promptly Inspected

Editor: The salvage project of the "Baoshen" dredger of the Lianyungang Port Sub-bureau of Shandong Province was contracted to the salvage engineering team of the East China Maritime Affairs Administration. After the project started at the end of August last year, the cadres in charge of the salvage engineering team requested the dismantling of the "bucket frame" on the ship. The workers all said that it could not be dismantled. The cadres in charge of the engineering team did not listen, and brought tools from Shanghai, and used more than two hundred workdays to dismantle the "bucket frame." But the ship did not float as a result. This time, the cost of transportation and labor, etc., was wasted more than 200 million yuan. The cadres in charge of the salvage engineering team saw that the bow of the ship floated after pumping water, and wanted to tie steel cables and drag it hard with manpower. At that time, the rear of the ship was still submerged in the water. According to the contract, the ship could not be towed at all unless it was completely afloat. Ship crew member Tian Weiji and others all said that it could not be towed, but Engineer Yao of the salvage engineering team put on a "big hat" and said, "Can you take responsibility?" The workers also reported the reasons why it could not be towed to the port sub-bureau, but the leaders of the port sub-bureau believed that they did not understand salvage technology and ignored the opinions of the masses. The "Baoshen" was forcibly towed eight hundred feet. Because the machine at the rear of the ship weighed more than one hundred tons and was submerged in the mud, it sank deeper and deeper, causing the bow of the ship floating on the water to sink lower and lower as it was towed. As a result, the hull was hit by stones and other objects below, and the middle waist was broken. It is estimated that if the hull had not broken, it would have only cost 2 billion yuan and taken six months to repair; now it will cost 3 billion to 3.5 billion yuan and take eight months to repair. The accident has occurred for several months now, and the relevant departments have not yet dealt with this issue. I hope that the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government will immediately send personnel to investigate and thoroughly investigate responsibility.

Jiangxi Construction Company Refuses to Accept Mass Opinion
More Than 100 Million Yuan of State Property Was Lost

Editor: On December 16th last year, a tool-sharpening room collapsed at the Gaokeng Mine of the Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi. Due to actual needs, the Pingxiang Mining Bureau decided to level the soil hill behind the tool-sharpening room of the Gaokeng Mine. This project was contracted by the Jiangxi Construction Company. The soil quality of this soil hill is very loose in the upper layer and very solid in the lower layer. According to construction principles, the upper layer should be dug first, and then the lower layer. However, the Jiangxi Construction Company did the opposite, digging the solid soil in the lower layer first. The workers believed that this approach was very dangerous and repeatedly expressed their opinions to the construction personnel in charge of the company. But they ignored them. On December 7th last year, the workers found some cracks on the ground and the tool-sharpening room was in danger of being pushed down by the soil, so they raised their opinions to them again. They still did not listen. As a result, at noon on the 16th, the loose soil above the soil hill collapsed together, pushing down the tool-sharpening room, causing losses of more than 100 million yuan, and causing Gaokeng Mine to stop production for five shifts. The serious bureaucracy of the leading cadres of Jiangxi Construction Company is intolerable.

East China Textile Administration Qingdao Branch
There is Serious Waste in Expenditure

Editor: The Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration has serious waste in its expenditure. In the past, cadres at the level of division chief or above in this bureau were given a monthly entertainment allowance, and they did not turn in the unused portion to the public. The per diem for business trips stipulated by this bureau is also very high. Some staff members went to Beijing from Qingdao for meetings, and in two or three months, they "saved" more than 1 million yuan; the "saved" expenses were not returned to the public. Some cadres were even sent to study, and in addition to the travel expenses being reimbursed by the public, the cadres on the supply system were given more than 2 million yuan as travel expenses for their winter vacation back home. The above situation shows that there are extremely unreasonable phenomena in the financial system of the Qingdao Textile Administration Branch, which has resulted in serious waste. It is hoped that the relevant departments will promptly inspect it.

Suppress Democracy and Retaliate Against Critics
Relevant Authorities Should Promptly Investigate and Handle

Editor: Since we wrote on behalf of the masses to expose the corrupt behavior of Liao Yuanshi, the militia platoon leader of Shiqiao Township, Qingfeng District, Jianhu County, Suibei, Liao Yuanshi has colluded with the village chief Zhi Xuanxing to plot revenge. On the evening of November 14th last year, Zhi Xuanxing personally ran to our school office to question us "why we wrote for 'spies'," and said: "You are not allowed to write anymore, otherwise we will put you in boiling water!" Because they are afraid of criticism, they unscrupulously slander village cadres who submitted articles such as Han Dequan (director of the farmers' association, member of the Chinese Communist Party), Jiang Zhaoyou (family member of a martyr), Liao Dachuan (family member of a soldier), and Wang Shiyong (propagandist and reading group leader) as "spies." Recently, Liao Yuanshi forced us to rewrite the article, sign, and stamp it, and explain this issue to the newspaper, but we refused. We request that the relevant authorities promptly investigate and deal with this kind of bad behavior of suppressing democracy and suppressing mass criticism.

Yao Dingchang Jin Shi Chen Guang

Editor's note: Retaliating against critics is a serious illegal act. It is hoped that the leading authorities in Suibei will immediately instruct the party organization and the People's Government of Jianhu County to thoroughly investigate and deal with this matter and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

Oppose the Crude and Poorly Made Pictures on Postcards

Editor: We are constantly receiving a large number of慰问品 (comfort items) from all over the motherland. These 慰问品 inspire our fighting will and strengthen our unparalleled love for the motherland and the people of the motherland.

However, some 慰问品, such as the postcard pictures printed by Shanghai Sanmin Book Company, are very bad. These postcards are printed with the words "China People's Post Office Postcard" in large characters, and images of Chairman Mao, General Kim Il-sung, and Comrade Wu Xiuquan speaking at the United Nations General Assembly. These images are very poorly drawn. Many comrades believe that this is an insult to revolutionary leaders and national representatives, and this is intolerable. Therefore, we question the publishers and editors: Why did you produce such crude and poorly made pictures? A deep introspection should be made from the ideological perspective. The publishing agency should be responsible for seriously handling this matter.

    大业营造厂资本家偷工减料
    一次即盗窃达二十亿元
    编辑同志：北京工业学院在西郊修建一所校舍——“延安大楼”，它的建筑费是一百七十多亿元。这个工程是大业营造厂承包的。该厂经理是个奸商。他不按合同办事，以坏顶好，以假充真，偷工减料，获取暴利。比如屋顶望板原应用红松，他竟用了被洋灰侵蚀过的盒子板。奸商对此美其名曰“节约”。奸商盗走了价值十二亿元的洋灰模型板，把管理费八亿元大部盗窃了。这座“延安大楼”到现在还没有完工，但已经是百孔千疮，摇摇欲坠了。如地基夯不合规格，已开始下陷。有的墙壁裂缝长达一公尺，砖缝宽度超过合同规定七倍。大梁已撑上了支柱。洋灰一触即下落。钢窗坏了九十多个。一下雨，屋顶就漏水。据初步检查，已浪费二十亿元以上。完工期仍然遥遥无期，这个损失更属难以估计。现在，人民政府已逮捕了大业营造厂经理，我们要求向他追回全部损失，并予以严惩。

    店员夏永瑞打破顾虑检举奸商
    编辑同志：我是北京中德药房的学徒。中德药房的经理是一个奸商，他一贯偷税、漏税和贩卖毒品。他对待店员实在凶狠，曾解雇有十四年工龄的店员曹士昌，气得曹眼瞎病死。他经常给我小恩小惠，使我变成了他的尾巴。他买了一批赤酒，然后偷税卖出。被查出后，应补缴六百多万元。我受了他的指使，就向酒业专卖公司负责人诉说店里没有钱。因此，这笔钱他到现在还没有缴。我就这样地叛变了工人阶级。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动一开始，店里工会组织动员我，但我有思想顾虑。我怕自己因帮助奸商偷税而犯罪，又怕失业。我每天坐卧不安，饭也不想吃。自参加了第一次店员代表会议，我才了解了政府的政策。我心里亮了，我要洗净手，回到自己队伍中来。因此，我把我店经理的罪行——走私外汇五亿多元，偷漏税款十二亿元，贩卖毒品，存有大量的鸦片和白面，以及贿赂干部，造假药等四十多件，都毫无保留地检举出来了。

    奸商郝金贿赂干部偷盗国家财产应受严惩
    编辑同志：北京私营新东北营造厂副经理郝金是一个向干部行贿、盗窃国家财产的大奸商。全国各地受他贿赂的干部，约在五十人以上。人民革命军事委员会某部工作人员王福禄就是被他拖下水的。去年七月，他用欺骗收买的手段，要王福禄给他盗取建筑工程的标底，因而中标。他给了王福禄八千万元。八月，他送一千万元给王的家里，想收买王的妻子，以便利用王福禄，进一步偷工减料，获取暴利。他在某部的建筑工程上所盗取的财富，实在没法计算。郝金的不法行为是非常严重的，我要求政府对他严加惩处。　黄　俭

    应迅速检查“保深号”挖泥船的打捞工程
    编辑同志：山东连云港务分局的“保深号”挖泥船的打捞工程，是由华东海运管理局打捞工程队承包的。工程在去年八月底动工后，打捞工程队负责干部要求拆卸船上的“斗架”。工人们都说不能拆。工程队负责干部不听，从上海运来工具，用二百多个工把“斗架”拆下了。但船身并没有因此而浮起。这一次白白损失运费、工费等二亿多元。打捞工程队负责干部看见船头在抽水后浮起，就要拴钢丝绳用人工硬拖。当时船的后部还沉在水底，按照合同规定，船没有全部浮起，根本不能拖。船员田维己等都说不能拖，打捞工程队的姚工程师却把“大帽子”一扣，说：“你们能负责吗？”工人们还把不能拖的理由反映给港务分局，但港务分局领导方面认为自己不懂打捞技术，对群众意见置之不理。“保深号”硬被拖了八百英尺。由于船身后部的机器有一百多吨重，沉在泥中，越沉越深，使浮在水面的船头也越拖越往下沉。结果，船体给下面的石头等物碰住，中间腰部因而折断了。据估计，船身若不折断，只需二十亿元费用，用六个月时间，就能修好；现在需三十亿到三十五亿元的费用，要八个月才能修好。事故发生到现在已有数月，有关部门还没有处理这个问题。我希望中央人民政府交通部立即派员前往调查，彻底追究责任。

    江西建筑公司拒绝接受群众意见
    国家财产损失了一亿多元
    编辑同志：去年十二月十六日，江西萍乡煤矿高坑矿发生制钎房倒塌事件。由于实际需要，萍乡矿务局决定把高坑矿制钎房后面的土山挖平。这个工程由江西建筑公司承办。这座土山的土质是上层很松，下层很结实。按照施工原则，理应先挖上层，然后再挖下层。江西建筑公司却偏偏相反，先挖下层的结实土。工人们认为这样做法非常危险，再三向公司的负责施工人员提出意见。但他们却置之不理。去年十二月七日，工人们发现地面上有一些裂缝，制钎房有被土推倒的危险，就又向他们提意见。他们还是不听。结果，在十六日中午，土山上面的松土一起崩下来，把制钎房推倒了，损失达一亿多元，并使高坑矿停止了五班生产。江西建筑公司领导干部这种严重的官僚主义，是不能容忍的。

    华东纺织管理局青岛分局
    经费开支有严重浪费现象
    编辑同志：华东纺织管理局青岛分局，在经费开支上有严重的浪费现象。过去这个局的处长一级以上的干部，每月都发招待费，用不完也不交公。这个局规定的出差费也很高，有些工作人员由青岛到北京开会，三两个月时间，就“节余”了一百多万元；“节余”的费用也没有交还公家。甚至有些干部派去学习时，除去时路费由公家报销外，供给制的干部还特别多给二百多万元，作为他们寒假回去时的路费。以上情况，说明了青岛纺织管理分局在财政制度上有极不合理的现象，以致造成了严重的浪费，希有关部门迅速检查。

    苏北建湖县石桥乡干部廖远师等
    压制民主向批评者进行报复
    有关机关应该迅速调查处理
    编辑同志：自从我们代笔替群众在报上揭发了苏北建湖县庆丰区石桥乡民兵中队长廖远师贪污腐化的行为后，廖远师就勾结村长支选兴图谋报复。去年十一月十四日晚，支选兴亲自跑到我们学校办公室里来，责问我们“为什么替‘特务’写稿”，并说：“以后不许再写，否则就叫你们下烫锅！”因为他们害怕批评，就不择手段地诬蔑投稿的村干部韩德全（农会主任、中共党员）、蒋兆友（烈属）、廖大传（军属）、王士勇（宣传员兼读报组长）等人为“特务”。最近，廖远师又强迫我们重新写稿签字盖印，向报社解释这个问题，但被我们拒绝了。我们要求有关机关对这种压制民主，压制群众批评的恶劣作风，迅速调查处理。
                  姚定昌　金石　陈光
    编者按：向批评者进行报复，是一种严重的犯法行为。希望苏北的领导机关，立即指令建湖县的党组织和人民政府，彻底检查、处理这件事情，并在报上公布处理结果。
    反对粗制滥造明信片上的画片
    编辑同志：我们源源不断地接到来自祖国各地的大批慰问品，这些慰问品鼓舞了我们战斗的意志，更加强了我们对祖国和祖国人民无比的热爱。
    但是，有些慰问品，例如上海三民图书公司印制的明信画片，是很不好的。这些明信片上印着“中华人民邮政明信片”几个大字，和毛主席、金日成将军的像以及伍修权同志在联合国大会上发言时的形象。这些像画得十分不好。不少同志都认为这是一种侮辱革命领袖和国家代表的画片，这是不能容忍的。因此，我们向出版、编绘的人质问：你们为什么制出这样粗制滥造的画片呢？应从思想上来作深刻的检讨。出版机关应负责认真处理这件事。
