Yang Shoukun, director of the sand casting workshop of the Northeast Agricultural Implement Factory, created the "Double Weighing Molding Method," which greatly improved the efficiency and quality of sand casting. Previously, because 90 percent of the workers in this sand casting workshop were apprentices, production efficiency was extremely low and the scrap rate was very high, and the task had never been completed. However, after adopting this new molding method, although the production task in the fourth quarter of last year increased by one time compared to the previous year, it was still completed ten days ahead of schedule. According to statistics from eighteen types of casting work, after trialing the new molding method, the average scrap rate dropped from about 20 percent to 1.2 percent, and production efficiency increased three to seven times.

The "Double Weighing Molding Method" was created by Yang Shoukun after identifying the main causes of scrap products during inspections of finished products. Originally, in the past, when making sand molds, they would place the two half-sided wooden models made according to the product style separately in the upper and lower sand boxes, ram the sand, and after taking out the models, buckle the two sand boxes together and then pour the casting. However, the models inside were easily misaligned when buckling the sand boxes, so the cast products were often not up to specifications. The "Double Weighing Molding Method" developed by Yang Shoukun is: First, accurately and symmetrically align the two half-sided wooden models made according to the product style on both sides of a model board, glue them on with glue, and after the glue dries, nail them with nails. Then, buckle the sand boxes onto both sides of this model board, and insert the tenon of the upper sand box into the tenon hole of the model board and the lower sand box to fix its position and prevent deviation. Next, ram the sand separately in the lower sand box and the upper sand box. After ramming all the sand, take out the middle model board, and then buckle the two sand boxes together. At this time, the two half-sand molds are tightly joined into a complete sand mold, which can be cast. The result of doing this is that, on the one hand, the positions of the half-sided wooden molds on both sides of the model board are symmetrically fixed, and on the other hand, because there are fixed tenons and tenon holes, the position can be fixed when the upper and lower sand boxes are buckled together, so the sand mold produced is very accurate, and the cast products are also up to specifications. In addition to being made of wood, this model board can also be cast from aluminum or other metals with small shrinkage. This is more durable, and the tenon holes on the board are not easily worn out, making it more accurate.

Recently, the Shenyang Municipal Machinery Manufacturing Trade Union has organized casting workers from various factories to visit the Agricultural Implement Factory to see this molding method, preparing to promote it throughout the city. Zhao Haifeng, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Trade Union, and Yang Tihe, Chairman of the Shenyang Municipal Machinery Manufacturing Trade Union, both pointed out that the "Double Weighing Molding Method" provides new experience for the molding technology of sand casting workshops, and the sand casting departments of various factories should learn it well.

    东北农具一厂杨守训创造“双称造型法”
    翻砂效率提高三倍到七倍，废品率降到百分之一点二
    东北农具一厂翻砂车间主任杨守训创造“双称造型法”，大大提高了翻砂的效率和产品质量。过去这个翻砂车间因为百分之九十的工人都是徒工，生产效率特低，废品率很高，从来没有完成过任务。但在采用这个新造型法后，虽然去年第四季的生产任务较前增加一倍，还是提前十天完成了。根据十八种铸件活的统计，试用新造型法后，废品率平均由百分之二十左右降到百分之一点二，生产效率提高三倍到七倍。 “双称造型法”是杨守训在检查成品时找出了产生废品的主要原因以后创造出来的。原来过去他们在制造砂型时，都是把按照产品式样制成的两个半边木模型分别在上、下砂箱中摆好，撞上砂，等把模型取出后，再把两个砂箱扣到一起，然后浇铸的。但扣砂箱时里面模型很容易扣偏，因此浇铸出的产品往往不合规格。杨守训研究出的“双称造型法”是：先把按照产品式样制成的两个半边木模型准确地在一块模型板的两面对称合好，用胶水黏上，胶水干后再用钉子钉住，然后在这块模型板的两面扣上砂箱，并把上砂箱的插鞘穿进模型板与下砂箱的鞘孔，使其位置固定，不出偏差，接着分别在下砂箱和上砂箱内撞砂，都撞好砂以后，就把中间的模型板取出，再把两个砂箱扣到一起，这时两个半面砂型就密合为一个整砂型，就可以浇铸了。这样做的结果，一方面因为模型板两面半边木型的位置都是对称地被固定住，又因为有了固定的插鞘和鞘孔，使上、下砂箱相扣时位置能够固定，因此造出的砂型就很准确，浇铸出的产品也就合乎规格。这种模型板，除用木板制造外，还可以用铝或者其他收缩性小的金属浇铸。这样更耐久，并且板上的鞘孔不易磨大，也就更准确。
    最近，沈阳市机器制造业工会已组织各厂的铸造工人前往农具一厂参观这种造型法，准备在全市推广。东北机器制造业工会筹备委员会副主席赵海峰和沈阳市机器制造业工会主席杨体和都指出，“双称造型法”为翻砂车间的造型技术提供了新的经验，各厂翻砂部门都应当很好地学习。
