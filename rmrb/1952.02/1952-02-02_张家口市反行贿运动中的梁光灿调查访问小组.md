Liang Guangcan, a member of the Communist Youth League, is a clerk at the Hengyuan Yong Fur Shop in Zhangjiakou City. After the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he was very happy to hear the reports from his superiors and the instructions from the upper-level Youth League committee. He was determined to wage a resolute struggle against illegal acts that harmed state property. However, in his industry, many clerks and Youth League members had great concerns about launching a frank confession and accusation movement against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. The difficulties in front of him did not discourage Liang Guangcan, because he thought of Chairman Mao's call and the spirit of the volunteer soldiers fighting selflessly in Korea despite difficulties. Therefore, he decided to dispel the concerns of these Youth League members and clerks, and mobilize them to join the movement. Liang Guangcan took the initiative to assist the grassroots trade union in convening a meeting attended by more than fifty young workers and activists. He himself first reported the bribery of the store manager of his store and conveyed the report of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. However, only two Youth League members—Chu Mingliang and Wu Changzhen—reported the illegal act of the store manager bribing Liu Guangyu, a cadre of the Tax Bureau. Most of the clerks did not speak. The first accusation meeting failed.

This still did not discourage Liang Guangcan. He took the initiative to study with Chu Mingliang and Wu Changzhen, analyzing the reasons for the failure of this meeting, which made them clearly realize that to mobilize young clerks to participate in the struggle, it was not only necessary to dispel their concerns, but also to have a certain organizational form. Therefore, he first united four people, including Youth League member Chu Mingliang, to form an investigation and visitation group. At the same time, they analyzed the ideological situation of ordinary clerks: fearing "unemployment," fearing "managerial crackdown," and fearing that "the business would collapse and they would not be able to share dividends," and so on. In response to these concerns, they carried out publicity. For example, Youth League member Wu Changzhen initially did not dare to actively participate in the movement because he had engaged in bribery. After Liang Guangcan mobilized him to confess, he threw away his "burden," and his enthusiasm quickly increased. Most of the clerks realized that the despicable means of bribery used by unscrupulous merchants to steal state property were criminal acts that undermined the construction of the motherland.

With the development of the movement, the members of the Liang Guangcan Investigation and Visitation Group were active in the fur industry firms, conducting in-depth investigations. The Liang Guangcan Investigation and Visitation Group became an important force in reporting illegal cases such as bribery and tax evasion. In the process of separate investigations and visits, the members of the Liang Guangcan Group adopted a variety of methods according to the different specific circumstances of each firm. Generally, they mobilized the masses, visited the clerks, looked for clues, and directly inquired and investigated the merchants. In the visits and investigations, they adopted a method of uniting, befriending, and educating the labor side; and a method of combining explaining policies, mobilizing confessions, and resolutely reporting the capitalist side. They also educated through examples to break the capitalists’ concerns, such as fearing "losing face" and "going to jail." When encountering stubborn bribe-givers, they would conduct side-by-side inquiries with nearby clerks to find clues, gradually deepen the investigation, and encircle and suppress them. For example, Li Xi'an, the manager of Zhenfeng Fur Industry, confessed his bribery crimes under this kind of pressure. The vigorous development of the reporting movement against bribery and tax evasion in the fur industry is inseparable from the activities of the Liang Guangcan Group.

Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm and under the correct leadership and support of the Party, the League, and the trade union, the Liang Guangcan Group has become a shock force in the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement in the industrial and commercial circles of Zhangjiakou City. From January 12 to 15, this group visited and investigated 55 firms in three days, discovering 156 cases of bribery, tax evasion, and other illegal activities, totaling more than 53 million RMB.

    张家口市反行贿运动中的梁光灿调查访问小组
    管子明、杨锦庭
    青年团员梁光灿，是张家口市恒源永皮毛行的店员。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以后，他听了首长的报告和上级团委的指示，心里非常高兴。他下定决心要向损害国家财产的不法行为进行坚决的斗争。但是，他所在的这个行业里，许多店员和青年团员，对开展反行贿、反偷税漏税，反盗窃国家资财的坦白检举运动，有着很大的顾虑。摆在面前的这种困难，并没有使梁光灿灰心丧气，因为他想到了毛主席的号召，想到了志愿军在朝鲜克服困难、忘我战斗的精神。于是，他决心要解除这些青年团员和店员的顾虑，发动他们投入运动。梁光灿主动地协助基层工会召开了一个五十多名青工店员积极分子参加的会议。他自己首先检举了本店经理的行贿行为，并传达了青年团张家口市委的报告。但会上只有两个青年团员——褚明亮、武长祯检举了本店经理向税务局干部刘光裕行贿的非法行为。大多数店员没有说话。第一次检举大会失败了。
    这依然没有使梁光灿泄气。他主动地和褚明亮、武长祯共同研究，分析了这次大会失败的原因，这使他们明确地认识到：发动青年店员参加斗争，不但要解除他们的顾虑，而且还需要有一定的组织形式。因此，他首先团结了青年团员褚明亮等四人，组成了调查访问小组。同时分析了一般店员的思想情况：怕“失业”，怕“经理打击”，怕“买卖垮了分不上红利”等等。针对这些顾虑，他们进行了宣传。如青年团员武长祯最初因为自己有行贿行为，不敢积极参加运动。经梁光灿动员坦白后，丢掉了“包袱”，积极性很快提高了。大部分店员认识了奸商用行贿等卑鄙手段盗窃国家财产，是破坏祖国建设事业的犯罪行为。
    随着运动的发展，梁光灿调查访问小组的组员们，活跃在皮毛业商号里，进行深入的调查。梁光灿调查访问小组成了检举行贿、偷税等非法案件的一支重要力量。在分头调查访问的过程中，梁光灿小组的组员，根据每家商号不同的具体情况，采取了多种多样的方法。一般的是：发动群众，访问店员，寻找线索，直接向商户询问调查。在访问调查中，他们对劳方是采取团结、友爱、教育的方式；对资方是采取讲解政策、动员坦白和坚决检举相结合的方式。并通过实例进行教育，打破资方的顾虑，如怕“丢脸”、“坐监”等。遇到顽固不化的行贿分子，便向附近店员进行侧面了解，摸着线索，逐步深入，进行围剿。如振丰皮毛业经理李锡安就是在这种压力之下坦白了自己的行贿罪行的。皮毛业反行贿、反偷税漏税的检举运动所以轰轰烈烈地开展起来，是和梁光灿小组的活动分不开的。
    梁光灿小组在爱国主义热情的鼓舞下，在党、团、工会的正确领导和支持下，已成为张家口市工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中的一个突击力量。这个小组从一月十二日到十五日，三天时间就访问、调查了五十五家商号，发现行贿、偷税等案件一百五十六起，计人民币五千三百多万元。
