Protesting the Crime of American Aggressor Troops Spreading Bacteria
Korean People's Army Soldiers Vow to Strike the Enemy More Heavily

The brave warriors of the Korean People's Army, fighting valiantly on the front lines, are extremely indignant at the heinous crime of the American aggressors spreading bacteria on a large scale. They have gathered to vow to strike the mad, shameless, and inhumane American bandits with even more heroic combat.

Kim Kwang-san, a gunner of a certain unit of the People's Army defending an important high ground on the eastern front, said angrily: The enemy, having repeatedly suffered defeats, has increasingly exposed its vile and ferocious murderous demon face. As early as last year, the enemy used poison gas bombs several times on the Korean front and barbarously used captured personnel from our People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to experiment with bacteriological weapons. This time, the enemy has intensified its actions and used bacteriological weapons on a large scale. However, contrary to the enemy's insidious aims, none of its atrocities can weaken our determination to kill the enemy and our combat power. We must further enhance our vigilance and engage in a more heroic struggle with the enemy, who is committing heinous crimes to delay the armistice negotiations and prepare to expand the war, until a fair and reasonable peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is achieved.

Zhao Guoxi, a model combatant of a certain unit of the People's Army, said at a discussion meeting of the unit: The German and Japanese fascists who attempted to use bacteriological weapons on a large scale have met with a disgraceful demise in the face of the Soviet Union's just armed forces. Today, the inheritors of the Hitler fascists—the American imperialist bandits—will absolutely not be able to realize their same sinister schemes in the face of our Korean and Chinese People's armies. We vow to respond to the enemy's heinous crimes with even heavier blows.

Medical personnel of a certain rear hospital affiliated with the Medical Bureau of the Korean People's Army also held a symposium. At the meeting, everyone unanimously denounced the inhuman bestial atrocities committed by the American aggressor bandits in waging bacteriological warfare in Korea. Li Zhuxun, a junior anti-epidemic doctor, accused the American aggressors of spreading a large number of infectious disease germs in the northern region of Korea from December 1950 to early 1951. She said indignantly: This time, the American aggressor troops have intensified their actions and scattered a large number of bacteria in our front and rear. We must accuse the American beast troops of this inhumane and heinous crime to the whole world. Those who attended the symposium were filled with anger after listening to Li Zhuxun's accusations. Doctors and nurses spoke one after another, pointing out that the American bandits' creation of this new atrocity clearly showed the American government's lack of sincerity in the armistice negotiations; it once again proved that American imperialism is the most sinister enemy of the people of Korea and China, as well as the people of the world. Everyone unanimously decided to further strengthen anti-epidemic work and widely promote anti-epidemic propaganda.

Korean Farmers' Alliance Leaders and Others Protest American Military's Crime of Spreading Bacteria

Xuan Qizhong, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Farmers' Alliance, and Kang Liangyu, chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Christian League, issued statements on the 26th, respectively, actively supporting Foreign Minister Park Heon-young's protest against the American aggressors' large-scale spreading of bacteria. Xuan Qizhong said: The enemy's heinous crime can only further promote its own final defeat. This crime has aroused strong indignation among the people of Korea and China and the peace-loving people of the world. All Korean farmers, together with all the Korean people, warmly support Foreign Minister Park Heon-young's statement, denounce the criminal acts of the American aggressors and their lackeys, and will resolutely fight to ensure that these bacteriological war criminals are subjected to the just trial of the people of the world. Kang Liangyu, in his speech, on behalf of all patriotic Christians in North Korea, sternly condemned the heinous crimes committed by the aggressors in massacring the Korean people, and called on everyone to be vigilant and dedicate all their strength to the war of liberation of the motherland.

Hungarian Newspapers Condemn American Aggressors as Man-Eating Savages

Hungarian newspapers have widely published commentaries on the recent bacteriological warfare waged by the United States in Korea. *The Light Daily* said: Every upright person is deeply indignant when they learn that the American aggressors, whose hands are stained with blood, have begun to carry out bacteriological warfare. The American aggressors have admitted that their heavy artillery is useless, because this artillery has completely lost its effectiveness under the heroic resistance of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Therefore, they are now sending planes loaded with millions of insects carrying bacteria to harm the Korean people. The American aggressors seem to have spent a long time preparing this despicable weapon. They initially defended the Japanese war criminals who committed the crime of preparing bacteriological warfare, then released these war criminals and sent them to Korea to experiment with their bacteriological weapons on prisoners of war. Now the United States has used their bacteria to save their desperate fate. Their crimes provide new evidence that the imperialists are indeed man-eating savages. *Hungarian National Daily* published this news on the front page in four columns, and said: The crimes committed by the United States in Korea can only further increase the surging hatred of the Korean and Chinese soldiers. Other Hungarian newspapers also condemned the bacteriological warfare waged by the United States in Korea. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　抗议美国侵略军撒布细菌的罪行
    朝鲜人民军战士宣誓要更沉重地打击敌人
    在火线上奋勇抗战的朝鲜人民军勇士们，对于美国侵略者大量撒布细菌的滔天罪行极度愤慨。他们纷纷集会，誓以更加英勇的战斗来打击疯狂无耻丧尽人性的美国强盗。
    保卫着东线某重要高地的人民军某部的炮手金光山愤怒地说：屡遭失败的敌人已日益暴露了它卑鄙而凶恶的杀人魔鬼的面目。早在去年，敌人就曾在朝鲜前线几次使用了毒气弹，并野蛮地用我们人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员试验细菌武器。这次敌人竟又变本加厉地大量使用了细菌武器。但是，正和敌人的阴谋目的相反，它的任何暴行绝不能削弱我们的杀敌决心和战斗力量。我们一定要进一步提高警惕，与为拖延停战谈判、准备扩大战争而制造着滔天罪行的敌人展开更加英勇的斗争，直到朝鲜问题获得公平合理的和平解决为止。
    人民军某部模范战斗员赵国熙在该部的座谈会上说：过去企图大规模使用细菌武器的德、日法西斯，在苏联正义的武装力量面前已遭到了可耻的灭亡。今天，希特勒法西斯的继承者——美帝国主义强盗，在我们朝中人民军队面前，也是绝对实现不了其同样的阴谋诡计的。我们誓以更加沉重的打击来答复敌人的万恶罪行。
    朝鲜人民军军医局所属某后方医院的医护人员也举行了一个座谈会。会上大家一致痛斥美国侵略强盗在朝鲜进行细菌战争的种种绝灭人性的野兽暴行。防疫准医李竹洵在会上控诉了美国侵略者在一九五零年十二月到一九五一年初期间，在朝鲜北部地区大量撒布传染病菌的罪行。她激愤地说：这次美国侵略军更变本加厉地在我们前后方撒下大批细菌，我们必须向全世界控诉美国兽军的这种绝灭人性的滔天罪行。参加座谈会的人听了李竹洵的控诉，怒不可遏。医生和护士们纷纷发言，指出美国强盗制造这种新的暴行，明显地表现了美国政府对停战谈判缺乏诚意；又一次证明了美帝国主义是朝中两国人民以及全世界人民的最险恶的敌人。大家一致决定要进一步加强防疫工作，广泛展开防疫宣传。
    朝鲜农民同盟领袖等抗议美军撒布细菌的罪行
    朝鲜农民同盟中央委员会副委员长玄七钟和北朝鲜基督教徒联盟中央委员会委员长康良煜在二十六日分别发表谈话，积极支持朴宪永外务相抗议美国侵略者大量撒布细菌的声明。玄七钟说：敌人这种万恶的罪行只能进一步促使他自己走向最后失败。这种罪行激起了朝中两国人民与全世界爱好和平人民的强烈愤怒。全朝鲜农民和全朝鲜人民一起，热烈支持朴宪永外务相的声明，痛斥美国侵略者及其走狗的罪恶行为，并将坚决进行斗争，务必使这些细菌战犯们受到全世界人民的正义裁判。康良煜在谈话中代表北朝鲜全体爱国的基督教徒严词斥责侵略者为虐杀朝鲜人民而制造的凶恶罪行，并号召大家提高警惕，为祖国解放战争而献出一切力量。
    匈报斥美国侵略者为吃人生番
    匈牙利报纸对于最近美国在朝鲜进行的细菌战广泛地发表了评论。《光明报》说：每一个正直的人知道了双手染满鲜血的美国侵略者已经开始实行细菌战时，都深表愤慨。美国侵略者已承认他们的重炮是不中用了，因为这种炮在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇抵抗之下完全失去了效力。因此，他们现在派遣飞机装载着千百万带有细菌的昆虫来危害朝鲜人民。美国侵略者似乎曾花了长久的时间来准备这种可耻的武器。他们起初曾为那些犯了准备细菌战争的罪行的日本战犯辩护，然后把这些战犯释放并送他们到朝鲜，用他们的细菌武器在战俘身上试验。现在美国已利用他们的细菌来挽救自己绝望的命运。他们的罪行提供了新的证据，说明了帝国主义分子实在是吃人的生番。《匈牙利国家报》以首页四栏的地位刊登这个消息，并说：美国在朝鲜所犯的这些罪行，只能更增加朝鲜和中国战士们的高涨的敌忾。其他匈牙利报纸也同样谴责美国在朝鲜进行的细菌战争。  （据新华社消息）
