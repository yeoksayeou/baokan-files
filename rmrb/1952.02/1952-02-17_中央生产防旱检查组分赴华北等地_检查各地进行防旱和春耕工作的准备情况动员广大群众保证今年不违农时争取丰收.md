    [News from this newspaper] In order to promptly convey the Central Committee's decision on vigorously launching a mass drought prevention and resistance movement, and to inspect the preparations for drought prevention and spring plowing in various regions, the Central Production and Drought Prevention Office has organized Central Production and Drought Prevention Inspection Groups, which will depart immediately to work in the five provinces of North China, as well as Henan, Shandong, and the Northwest provinces and regions. The inspection groups are composed of cadres drawn from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, and the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative. At the inspection group meeting, Director Li Shucheng and Deputy Director Zhang Su of the Production and Drought Prevention Office gave important instructions. Deputy Director Zhang Su also gave a detailed explanation of the inspection group's work tasks. He said: In order to ensure timely farming and strive for a bumper harvest this year, various regions urgently need to mobilize immediately and carry out various preparations for drought prevention and spring plowing; and to overcome the paralyzing and wait-and-see mentality towards drought resistance that arises after snowfall. Production and drought prevention organizations at all levels in various regions should be established as early as possible; at the same time, it is necessary to dispatch cadres to go deep into the lower levels to understand the material preparations for water conservancy projects, waterwheels, farm tools, pesticides, fertilizers, seeds, etc., as well as the preparations for preventing and treating human and animal epidemics. Provinces, special districts, and counties can convene drought prevention meetings when necessary to implement the central government's policies and conduct widespread mobilization. In areas of North China that suffered disasters last year, the above work should be carried out in conjunction with disaster relief.
    Central departments concerned have taken the following emergency measures in preparation for drought prevention work. In February, a large amount of food will be transferred from the Northeast to areas that suffered drought last year and are experiencing severe drought this spring; in order to support the expansion of water conservancy projects in various regions, banks have also prepared a large amount of loans, which will be allocated to various provinces and regions on a priority basis; the health departments have formed two epidemic prevention detachments stationed in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces for mobile work; the cooperative is also preparing a large amount of fertilizer to supply the rural areas in a timely manner.

    中央生产防旱检查组分赴华北等地
    检查各地进行防旱和春耕工作的准备情况动员广大群众保证今年不违农时争取丰收
    【本报讯】中央生产防旱办公室为了及时传达中央关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定，并检查各地进行防旱和春耕工作的准备情况，特组织中央生产防旱检查组，即日分赴华北五省和河南、山东及西北等省区工作。检查组是由中央人民政府农业部、政务院华北行政委员会、中央人民政府内务部，和华北供销合作总社等单位抽调干部若干人组成的。在检查组会议上，生产防旱办公室李书城主任、张苏副主任作了重要指示。张苏副主任并对检查组的工作任务，作了详尽的说明。他说：为了做到不违农时，争取今年丰收，各地亟需即刻动员起来，进行防旱和春耕的各项准备；并克服在下雪后对抗旱所产生的麻痹观望思想。各地各级的生产防旱的组织应及早建立；同时需要抽调干部深入下层，实地了解有关水利工程物料、水车、农具、农药、肥料、种籽等物质准备情况，以及预防医治人疫、畜疫的准备情况。各省、专区和县，在必要时可召集防旱会议，以便贯彻中央政策和进行广泛动员。在华北去年发生灾情的地区，应该结合救灾进行以上工作。
    中央各有关部门在防旱工作的准备上，已进行了以下几项紧急措施。在二月份内，将有大批食粮从东北调配到去年遭受旱灾和今春干旱严重的地方；银行为了支援各地扩大水利兴修任务，也准备了大量贷款，重点地分配各省区使用；卫生部门组成了两个防疫中队分驻察哈尔、绥远二省流动工作；合作总社也正准备大批肥料，及时供应农村。
