    Leading Cadres of Hebei Provincial Grain Company
    Should Examine Their Mistakes in Shielding Major Embezzlers

    To the Editor: Leading cadres of the China Grain Company's Hebei Provincial Company have serious bureaucratic tendencies and right-leaning thought. They are actually shielding major embezzlers Yu Zhaonian and Lin Yihua, as well as accomplice Wang Xiaofeng. Yu Zhaonian is the manager of the Botouzhen branch of the Hebei Provincial Grain Company. He colluded with Lin Yihua, the accounting section chief of the branch company, warehouse accountant Wang Xiaofeng, and more than ten others to engage in collective embezzlement ten times. According to incomplete statistics, the amount embezzled reached 150,000 jin of grain. Furthermore, Yu colluded with private merchants, civilian grain stores, and grain exchanges, embezzling and accepting bribes totaling more than 1.5 million yuan. It was these unscrupulous merchants who lured Yu, resulting in large-scale theft of state assets, causing losses to the state amounting to 1.4 billion yuan.

    After the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Botouzhen Grain Branch Company provided the leading cadres of the Provincial Grain Company with clues about the embezzlement and bribery of Yu Zhaonian, Lin Yihua, and Wang Xiaofeng. However, instead of conducting in-depth investigations based on these materials, the Provincial Company actually sent Yu to Tongxian County and Lin to Huairou County to conduct investigation work. When the Botouzhen Grain Branch Company uncovered the collective embezzlement case led by Yu and Lin during the movement, they immediately sent Comrade Zhang Zengshan to the Provincial Company to request instructions and demand the return of the three criminals, Yu, Lin, and Wang, for legal action. However, the leading comrades of the Provincial Company actually said to Comrade Zhang Zengshan: "How should we talk to them? Otherwise, we can just say that your movement there cannot be carried out, and let them go back to lead the movement." Comrade Zhang Zengshan disagreed with this statement, saying that调greedy embezzlers back was to have them confess their problems. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Company finally accepted his opinion. This fact shows that the bureaucratic tendencies and right-leaning thought of the leading comrades of the Provincial Company are very serious. The leading cadres of the Provincial Grain Company should thoroughly examine why they shielded major embezzlers.

    河北省粮食公司领导干部
    应检查袒护大贪污犯的错误
    编辑同志：中国粮食公司河北省公司领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风和右倾思想，竟袒护大贪污犯于兆年、林浥华和胁从分子王晓峰。于兆年是河北省粮食公司泊头镇支公司经理，他曾勾结支公司会计股长林浥华、仓库会计王晓峰等十多人，进行集体贪污十次，据不完全的统计，贪污数目达十五万斤粮食。于犯并勾结私商同民粮店和粮食交易所，先后贪污受贿共一百五十多万元。是这些奸商拉拢于犯后，大量盗窃国家资财，使国家损失达十四亿元。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，泊头镇粮食支公司曾把于兆年、林浥华、王晓峰三人贪污受贿的线索，供给省粮食公司领导干部参考。但省公司不但不根据这些材料深入追究，反而派于犯去通县、林犯去怀柔县作调查工作。当泊头镇粮食支公司在运动中破获了以于、林为首的集体贪污案件后，马上派张增山同志到省公司请示，并要求追回于、林、王三犯，以便依法处理。但省公司领导同志竟对张增山同志说：“咱们怎样对他们说呢？要不然，咱就说是你们那里的运动搞不起来，让他们回去领导着闹去。”张增山同志不同意这种说法，他说调贪污犯回去，就是要他们交代问题。省公司的负责同志最后才接受了他的意见。这一事实说明了省公司领导同志的官僚主义和右倾思想是十分严重的，省粮食公司的领导干部应当彻底检查他们为什么袒护大贪污犯。
