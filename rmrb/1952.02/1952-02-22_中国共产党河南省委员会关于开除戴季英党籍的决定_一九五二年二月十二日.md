    Decision of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Dai Jiying from the Party
    February 12, 1952

    Dai Jiying, formerly a member of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee, was born in Huang'an County, Hubei Province, to a landlord family. He himself was a student. He is now 45 years old. He joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in 1926 and became a member of the Communist Party in 1927.

    In the more than 20 years that Dai Jiying participated in the revolutionary struggle, on the one hand, he did a lot of work and made considerable contributions to the Party and the people in several revolutionary periods. On the other hand, although he participated in the revolutionary struggle for a long time, his landlord class and petty-bourgeoisie selfish and individualistic essence remained and failed to be fundamentally transformed. Therefore, he has consistently and continuously engaged in improper activities, created disunity, highlighted himself, and opposed leadership throughout history, committing several serious errors of principle. In particular, after he took office as Secretary of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee, his errors developed to an extreme.

    First, it is manifested in serious political organizational indiscipline and anti-Party activities. At the first session of the Henan Provincial People's Congress, he arbitrarily expressed erroneous opinions that were in principle different from those of the Provincial Committee. At the joint meeting of the Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Consultative Conference, he again arbitrarily expressed erroneous opinions that were in principle different from those of the Provincial Committee, launching an attack against the Party. In order to forcibly put the label of "left" leaning on the Provincial Committee, he even distorted the phenomenon of corruption and waste, describing it as a manifestation of "left" leaning. In order to attack the Provincial Committee, he did not hesitate to resort to hooligan tactics, attributing the slogan of Kaifeng City's manure workers opposing the feudal boss "Oppose Ma Zhengzhi, the political 'horse' riding on the people's heads" (Ma Zhengzhi, a personal name, manure boss) to the Provincial Committee. In the implementation of the Central Committee and the Central South Bureau's resolution on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, on launching the masses to carry out democratic reforms, on the united front policy, and on the cadre policy, there were serious right-leaning ideas. He provoked relationships within the Party and the military, creating disunity. He openly exposed Party secrets at meetings outside the Party in order to boast about himself. He arbitrarily issued a letter of condolence to the old liberated areas in his own name. He often neither asked for leave nor attended the Provincial and Municipal Committee meetings. He did not write comprehensive reports on time. He refused the Provincial Committee's modification of the errors in his articles. The Provincial Committee formally decided to talk to him, but he refused three times in a row. Dai Jiying not only opposed and attacked the Provincial Committee, but also opposed the Central Committee. He disagreed with the Central Committee's conclusion on his historical mistakes. On the one hand, he wanted the Provincial Committee to resolve his historical problems and to re-evaluate the conclusions of his historical mistakes (that is, to overturn the Central Committee's conclusions), which was severely refuted by the Provincial Committee. On the other hand, he complained and made irresponsible remarks below, saying, "If he talks about Party history, others will fall." He said he did not agree with the Central Committee's conclusion on his mistakes. All of the above caused Dai Jiying to completely walk on a road of opposition to the Party in politics.

    Second, it is manifested in serious organizational factional activities and patriarchal rule, completely destroying the Party's principle of democratic centralism. In his work style, he was suspicious, fabricated things out of thin air, outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, lied everywhere, did not speak to people face-to-face, made irresponsible remarks behind their backs, and even impersonated others to sow discord. In the Municipal Committee meetings, he implemented patriarchal rule in the early stage, with no democratic style at all, and in the later stage, he passively ignored things, paralyzing the Municipal Committee. In cadre relations, he elevated himself and attacked others. Anyone who struggled against his mistakes was considered by him to be attacking him, excluding him, and sabotaging him. Therefore, he retaliated and attacked these people. Anyone who flattered and fawned on him was happily and unprincipledly accommodated, co-opted, promoted, and shielded, attempting to create a mountain stronghold and form a small factional group. All of the above caused Dai Jiying to completely walk on a road of opposition to the Party in organization.

    Third, it is manifested in the ideological consciousness of serious selfish and individualistic ideas and an egoistic idea of power and position. He thought of himself as a remarkable and great person. He touted himself as a "national hero," a "leader of the masses," and "almost a member of the Central Committee." He boasted that he "has talent" and "has foresight," and that he can do everything. All the great achievements that the people and the Party had painstakingly created in the areas where he had worked were written in his own account. If anyone did not praise him in this way, he would say that they were "disrespecting history" and were "forgetting their roots." He liked flattery, was prone to showmanship, promoted himself everywhere, and even resorted to hooligan and philistine tactics, writing articles in his own name under the guise of others to boast about himself, writing letters of thanks to himself in the name of the masses, and elevating himself by faking portraits of revolutionary martyrs and writing inscriptions on them. Dai Jiying's extremely serious landlord class and petty-bourgeois selfish and individualistic ideas and egoistic ideas of power and position are precisely the ideological source of his anti-Party activities in politics and his factional activities in organization, which made him degenerate into a politically incurable degenerate element.

    Finally, suppressing democracy and resisting the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, he not only did not take the lead in earnestly reflecting on himself, but also did not review many serious mistakes at all. Instead, he privately added a paragraph to the report to the Provincial Committee and the Central Committee on the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, stating that Dai Jiying had a "simple and frugal style." He even suppressed democracy and resisted the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, daring to openly intimidate people at the expanded meeting of the Municipal Committee, and then privately modified the records of criticisms made against him by cadres of the Municipal Committee organs. As a result, the normal progress of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in Kaifeng City was greatly affected.

    It is by no means accidental that Dai Jiying has consistently and continuously engaged in improper activities, created disunity, highlighted himself, and opposed leadership throughout history, and has developed to the point of carrying out anti-Party activities in politics and carrying out factional activities in organization to undermine the Party's principle of democratic centralism, degenerating into an incurable political degenerate element. The root cause lies in his unwillingness to truly transform himself with proletarian ideas, but stubbornly refusing to abandon his erroneous ideas. Although he also talked about Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, mass viewpoint, and mass line everywhere, he actually has no Marxism-Leninism, no Mao Zedong Thought, no mass viewpoint, and no mass line. In his mind, there are only selfish and individualistic ideas of the landlord class and petty-bourgeoisie and egoistic ideas of power and position. This is Dai Jiying's class ideological essence.

    Dai Jiying's mistakes have already had a serious negative impact on work, unity, cadres, and the masses. The Kaifeng Municipal Committee is nominally a Party committee, but it is actually in a paralyzed state with no core. Many resolutions of higher authorities have been shelved for a long time, not conveyed, and not discussed. Many tasks cannot be carried out normally, especially directly hindering the smooth progress of the current movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Because Dai Jiying carried out factional activities and accommodated and shielded cadres with problems, some cadres have been eroded by the bourgeoisie and have already rotted, and some are about to rot, causing cadres to feel depressed and distressed. Dai Jiying's anarchism, indiscipline, and anti-Party behavior, making irresponsible remarks, issuing proclamations indiscriminately, and creating new ideas have also had a negative impact on the masses. Kaifeng City is close to the Provincial Committee, but the Provincial Committee cannot promptly obtain work reports and material supplies from Kaifeng, affecting the Provincial Committee's normal leadership of the work of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee. In short, Dai Jiying's mistakes have caused serious and irreparable losses to the interests of the Party and the people.

    The Provincial Committee has carried out many struggles against Dai Jiying's mistakes. In the past three years, the Provincial Committee has convened five formal meetings of the Provincial Committee and the Municipal Committee to conduct education and struggle, and has conducted many talks. However, he has always consistently adhered to his mistakes, developed his mistakes, and has not shown the slightest intention of turning back and repenting. Recently, in order to save him for the last time, many responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee personally talked with him and educated him, and ordered the Municipal Committee to convene a meeting of Party member cadres to have him thoroughly review and reflect on himself. However, Dai Jiying still engaged in activities up and down, wooed people everywhere, and wrote and printed his past oral erroneous opinions that attacked the Provincial Committee into written form overnight, deleted the most absurd parts, and distributed them to the cadres at the meeting, attempting to confuse right and wrong. The Provincial Committee asked him to make a review at the meeting, but he still did not show any remorse, but instead resorted to various sophistries and resistance. From this, it can be seen that Dai Jiying is determined to adhere to his mistakes to the end. Based on the seriousness of Dai Jiying's mistakes and his attitude of adhering to his mistakes, he has lost the qualifications to be a Communist Party member. In order to strictly enforce the Party's iron discipline, purify the Party's organization, and enhance the Party's combat effectiveness, the Provincial Committee has decided, and has been approved by the Central Committee and the Central South Bureau, to expel Dai Jiying from the Party. The Provincial Committee also suggests that the Provincial and Kaifeng Municipal People's Governments and various revolutionary organizations remove him from all his posts. The Provincial Committee calls on Party committees at all levels in Kaifeng and Henan and all Party members to learn from Dai Jiying's mistakes and to fight for the complete eradication of erroneous ideas similar to those of Dai Jiying.

    中国共产党河南省委员会关于开除戴季英党籍的决定
    一九五二年二月十二日
    戴季英原任中共河南省委委员兼开封市委书记，湖北省黄安县人，地主家庭出身，本人学生成份，现年四十五岁，一九二六年加入中国共产主义青年团，一九二七年由团员转为党员。
    戴季英参加革命斗争二十多年来，一方面在几个革命时期，对党对人民曾经做了不少工作，有过相当贡献；另方面，他虽然参加革命斗争很久，但由于他的地主阶级和小资产阶级的自私自利思想与个人主义的本质仍然保留着而未能得到根本改造，所以在历史上一贯地不断地闹不正派活动，闹不团结，突出个人，反对领导，犯过几次严重的原则错误，特别是他到开封任市委书记后，其错误更发展到登峰造极的地步。
    首先，表现在政治上严重的无组织无纪律行为和反党的活动。他在省首届一次各界代表会议上擅自发表与省委有原则分歧的错误意见，他在省人民政府与省协商会联席会上再次擅自发表与省委有原则分歧的错误意见，向党进攻。他为了硬给省委加上“左”倾的帽子，竟把贪污浪费现象也歪曲地说成是“左”倾表现。他为了攻击省委，不惜玩弄流氓手段，把开封市粪业工会工人反对封建把头“反对骑在人民头上的马政治”（马正治，人名，粪业把头）的标语按在省委头上。他在执行中央与中南局的镇压反革命工作的决心上，发动群众进行民主改革上，统一战线政策上和干部政策上，均存在着严重的右倾思想。他在党内军内挑拨关系，制造不团结。他在党外会议上为了吹嘘自己，不惜公开暴露党的秘密。他擅自以个人名义发表老区慰问信。他对于省委与市委会议经常既不请假也不出席。他不按期按时写综合报告。他拒绝省委对他的文章错误地方的修改。省委正式决定找他谈话，他连续三次地拒绝。戴季英不仅反对与攻击省委，而且反对中央。他对中央对于他的历史上所犯错误的结论是不同意的。一方面他要省委解决他的历史问题，要省委对他历史上的错误结论重新估价（就是说推翻中央的结论），这曾遭到省委的严厉的驳斥。另方面他又不满地在下边乱说乱道，说什么“他一讲党史，别人就会垮台”，他说不同意中央对他所犯错误的结论。以上这些就使戴季英在政治上完全走到与党对立的道路。
    其次，表现在组织上严重的宗派活动与家长制统治，完全破坏了党的民主集中制原则。他在作风上疑神疑鬼，无中生有，阳奉阴违，处处撒谎，当面不说，背后乱说，甚至假冒别人名义挑拨离间。他在市委会上前一个时期实行家长制统治，毫无民主作风，后一个时期消极不管，陷市委于瘫痪状态。他在干部关系上抬高自己，打击别人，凡对他的错误进行斗争的人，他就认为是攻击他，排挤他，破坏他，因而他就实行报复，打击这些人；凡对他捧场奉承的人，他就很高兴地毫无原则地迁就、拉拢、提拔、包庇这些人，企图制造山头，形成小宗派集团。以上这些，就使戴季英在组织上完全走到与党对立的道路。
    再次，表现在思想意识上严重的自私自利的个人主义思想和唯我独尊的权位思想。他自以为自己是一个了不起的伟大人物，他自诩为“民族英雄”、“群众领袖”、“几乎是中央委员”，他自吹自擂地说自己“有才能”、“有远见”，样样工作都行。凡是他工作过的地区，把那里人民和党所艰苦创造的伟大功绩，都写在自己的账上，谁要是不这样来捧他，他就说谁是“不尊重历史”，是“忘本”。他喜人奉承，风头主义，处处宣扬自己，甚至不惜以流氓市侩手段，假借别人名义自己写文章来吹嘘自己，假借群众名义自己写信来感谢自己，假借画革命先烈遗像和在像上题词来抬高自己。戴季英这种极端严重的地主阶级与小资产阶级的自私自利的个人主义思想和唯我独尊的权位思想，正是他在政治上反党活动和组织上宗派活动的思想根源，这样就使他堕落成为一个政治上不可救药的蜕化分子。
    最后，压制民主，抵抗反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中他不仅没有带头认真反省，对许多严重错误根本不作检讨，反而私自在向省委和中央的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动报告上加添戴季英是“朴素节俭作风”的一段。他甚至压制民主，抵抗反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，竟敢公开在市委扩大会议上实行威吓，后又私自修改市委机关干部对他批评的记录。因而就大大影响了开封市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的正常进行。
    戴季英之所以在历史上一贯地不断地闹不正派活动，闹不团结，突出个人，反对领导，一直发展到今天在政治上进行反党活动，在组织上进行宗派活动破坏党的民主集中制原则，堕落成一个不可救药的政治蜕化分子决不是偶然的。其根源就在于他不肯真正地以无产阶级思想来改造自己，而是顽固地不肯放弃其错误思想。他虽然也到处口口声声讲马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、群众观念、群众路线，但实际上他没有一点马克思列宁主义思想，没有一点毛泽东思想，没有一点群众观念，没有一点群众路线，他脑子里只有一个地主阶级与小资产阶级的自私自利的个人主义思想和唯我独尊的权位思想。这一点就是戴季英的阶级思想本质。
    戴季英的错误，已经产生了对工作、对团结、对干部、对群众的严重恶劣影响。开封市委名为党委，实际处于无核心的瘫痪状态，许多上级决议停放很久，不传达不讨论，许多工作不能正常开展，尤其是直接障碍了目前反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的顺利进行。由于戴季英实行宗派活动，迁就包庇有毛病的干部，使有的干部被资产阶级侵蚀已经烂掉，有的快要烂掉，使干部情绪消沉苦闷。戴季英的无政府无纪律和反党行为，乱发议论，乱发文告，标新立异，也在群众中发生了恶劣的影响。开封市离省委近在咫尺，但省委从开封不能及时得到工作报告及材料的供应，影响了省委对开封市委工作的正常领导。总之，戴季英的错误给党和人民的利益造下严重的不可挽回的损失。
    省委对戴季英的错误是进行了不少斗争的，三年来省委曾召开省委、市委五次正式会议进行教育斗争，并进行多次谈话。而他始终一贯地坚持错误，发展错误，没有丝毫回头悔改之意。最近省委为了最后挽救他，省委不少负责同志亲与谈话教育，并责成市委召开党员干部会议要他彻底检讨反省，但戴季英仍然上下活动，到处拉拢，并把自己过去攻击省委的口头错误意见，又连夜赶写赶印成文字，删掉其中最荒谬部分，散发大会干部，企图混淆是非。省委要他在大会上进行检讨，但他同样毫无反省，而是多方狡辩抵抗。由此可见，戴季英决心坚持错误到底。根据戴季英错误的严重性及其坚持错误的态度，他已经丧失作为一个共产党员的条件。为严肃党的铁的纪律，纯洁党的组织，提高党的战斗力，省委决定并经中央和中南局批准开除戴季英的党籍。省委并建议省与开封市人民政府及各种革命组织撤消其一切职务。省委号召开封及河南各级党委和全体党员从戴季英的错误中受到教育，为彻底肃清类似戴季英的错误思想而斗争。
