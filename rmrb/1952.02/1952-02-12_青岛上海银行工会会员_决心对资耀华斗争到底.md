    Qingdao Shanghai Bank Union Members
    Determined to Fight Zhai Yaohua to the End
    To the Editor: After reading the facts published in your newspaper on February 3rd regarding Zhai Yaohua, the manager of Tianjin Shanghai Bank, engaging in illegal business dealings and refusing to thoroughly confess, all union members of our bank felt immense indignation. After liberation, Zhai Yaohua pretended to be progressive while engaging in illegal activities. Now, he is insincerely responding to the call for the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion movement, refusing to thoroughly confess. His vile behavior is truly a disgrace to our financial sector. All employees of the Qingdao branch of Shanghai Bank are determined to fight Zhai Yaohua to the end. In addition to having telegraphed our bank's board of directors in Beijing, suggesting that Zhai Yaohua be suspended from his duties and investigated, and having telegraphed the union's liaison organization of our entire bank in Shanghai, calling on all brothers to launch a struggle, we hereby express our attitude to the People's Daily and hope that the People's Daily will support our struggle.
    Qingdao Shanghai Bank Grassroots Union

    青岛上海银行工会会员
    决心对资耀华斗争到底
    编辑同志：二月三日你报刊载了天津上海银行经理资耀华经营非法买卖拒不彻底坦白的事实，我行全体工会会员读后都感到莫大愤慨。资耀华解放后伪装进步，干着非法勾当。现在，他又不真诚响应反行贿、反偷漏税运动的号召，拒绝彻底坦白。他这种恶劣的表现，真是我们金融界的耻辱。我们上海银行青岛分行全体职工决心对资耀华斗争到底。我们除已电告北京我行董事会建议对资耀华停职查办，并电促上海我行全行工会联系机构号召全行弟兄展开斗争外，特向人民日报表示态度，并盼人民日报支援我们的斗争。
