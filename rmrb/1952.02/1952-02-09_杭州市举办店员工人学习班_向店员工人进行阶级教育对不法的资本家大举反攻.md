    Hangzhou City Holds Shop Employee Workers' Study Class
    Conducts Class Education for Shop Employee Workers to Counterattack Unlawful Capitalists Vigorously
    The Hangzhou City Shop Employees' Union District Work Committees held shop employee workers' study classes during the Spring Festival, conducting class education for shop employee workers, and mobilizing shop employee workers to boldly expose the crimes of unlawful merchants. A total of two thousand two hundred and forty-seven people participated in the study, including grassroots trade union cadres, activists, accountants, and outside sales personnel from private shops in Hangzhou City. Through this study, all the students further clarified the ideological boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie. More than thirty people publicly exposed the criminal facts of unlawful merchants stealing state property and corrupting government staff over the past three years. All the students reported more than three thousand cases of unlawful acts by illegal merchants. Some of the accountants and outside sales personnel who participated in the study had been pulled by unlawful bosses to assist in certain illegal activities, so they had various concerns at the beginning of the movement. After this study, this group of people also expressed their unwavering commitment to stand firm on the working-class stance and counterattack unlawful capitalists. The director of a stationery store's business department was once coerced by the boss to help evade taxes, but in this study, he reported twenty-four illegal acts of the boss. In addition, through study and exposure struggles, the shop employee workers in each district increased the backbone of the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft and fraud of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence, which will be more conducive to counterattacking the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie.

    杭州市举办店员工人学习班
    向店员工人进行阶级教育对不法的资本家大举反攻
    杭州市店员工会各区工作委员会，在春节期间举办了店员工人学习班，向店员工人进行阶级教育，动员店员工人大胆检举不法商人的罪行。参加学习的有杭州市私营商店各基层工会干部、积极分子、会计、跑外人员共二千二百四十七人。经过这次学习，全体学员进一步划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限。有三十多人公开揭发了不法商人三年来窃盗国家财产、腐蚀政府工作人员的犯罪事实。全体学员共检举了不法商人的犯法行为三千多件。有一部分参加学习的会计、跑外人员等曾被不法老板拉去帮同进行过某些不法活动，因此在运动开展之初，还有多种顾虑。这一部分人经过这次学习，也纷纷表示毫不动摇地站稳工人阶级立场，向不法的资本家进行还击。某文具店营业部主任曾被老板胁迫帮同偷税漏税，但在这次学习中，检举了老板二十四件不法行为。另外，经过学习和检举斗争，各区店员工人中增加了反行贿，反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家财产、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争的骨干，将更利于向资产阶级的猖狂进攻进行反击。  （浙）
