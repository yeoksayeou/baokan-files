    Outstanding Sons and Daughters of the Motherland
    --Notes on Volunteer Army Recuperation in East China
    By Xia Guang, Representative of Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    We visited the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army recuperating in Nanjing and other places. These outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland created glorious achievements on the Korean battlefield. While recuperating in the motherland, they maintained the honor of the Volunteer Army, demonstrating noble revolutionary qualities and heroic spirit.
    I must first mention Comrade Sun Jinmin, whose feet and hands were disabled and eyes blinded. The artillery fire of the American bandits could cripple his body, but it could not damage the health of his mind. He often said to other wounded soldiers: "Although my body is disabled, my mind is not. I will never forget my hatred for American imperialism. My ears can hear, and my mouth can still speak. As long as my heart is beating, I can continue to fight the American aggressors." He held a strong love and hope for the rapidly progressing motherland and was full of joy in life. He listened attentively to hospital staff reading books and newspapers for study, and he vividly told them heroic stories from the battlefield. He sometimes enthusiastically participated in film and drama evenings, telling others: "Although I can't see, I can hear, understand the emotions in the play, and also receive education!" Many slightly wounded comrades were eagerly looking forward to returning to the Korean front as soon as possible. Comrade Zhao Dezhu still had a few small pieces of shrapnel in his body, but he could already move around. He made a wooden gun and often practiced bayonet drills in the courtyard. One wounded soldier carefully stored his blood-stained clothes. When others asked him, "Why keep these dirty clothes?" He always answered, "I want to always remember the crimes of the American bandits. I want to take it back to Korea and demand this blood debt from the American bandits!"
    When the Selected Works of Mao Zedong were published, the recuperating soldiers in Nanjing rushed to buy them. In various hospitals, they universally organized political and cultural studies. Their thirst for knowledge was more urgent than farmers' hopes for crop growth. Comrades Gu Rong and Zheng Ting's hands were disabled, so they tied pens to their arms to practice writing. Comrade Dai Youlin's feet were disabled, but he still actively led the work of the club, encouraging and helping wounded and sick comrades to write articles. The comrades who recuperated with him wrote many articles. One comrade who had been a cultural instructor in the company had both hands amputated. When he read, he held the book with his arms. Although it was inconvenient, he studied very hard. He often led everyone in singing, filling the ward with a cheerful atmosphere.
    As on the front lines, a high degree of class friendship was developed between Volunteer Army recuperation members and between recuperation members and hospital staff. In Ward 33 of a certain hospital, there were three seriously wounded soldiers and seven slightly wounded soldiers. The slightly wounded soldiers often pushed the seriously wounded soldiers in carts for walks. Comrade Wang Xinfu had three fingers amputated on his right hand. To reduce the fatigue of the nurses, he often brought back meals and served them in bowls to the seriously wounded comrades. Once, three seriously wounded soldiers arrived at a certain hospital. They were severely injured and groaning in pain. When the nurses heard that the surgery team had decided to give them blood transfusions, they rushed to sign up en masse. In a very short time, 1200 CC of fresh blood was transfused, saving the lives of these three wounded soldiers in time. The people of the motherland cherish our Volunteer Army wounded soldiers with such noble love! The recuperation members also cared for the nursing staff with the same sentiment. To reduce the fatigue of the nursing staff, the recuperation members often took the initiative to help them sweep the floor, get meals, and do minor labor such as washing spittoons. Once, doctor Yang Deren was busy all night without rest. Early the next morning, recuperation members Zhou Yushan and Wang Xinfa got up and brought washing water from the kitchen, quietly placing it in his room. The exemplary actions of the recuperation members also encouraged and promoted the work enthusiasm of the nursing staff. Nurse Xiang Zhihua said with emotion: "Whenever I am tired from work, I feel strong as soon as I think of you. You take care of us like this, how can we not take better care of you?"

    祖国的优秀儿女
    ——记在华东地区的志愿军休养员
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  夏光
    我们访问了在南京等地休养的志愿军伤病员。这些祖国的优秀儿女，他们在朝鲜战场上创造了光辉的战绩，回到祖国休养的时候，他们保持了志愿军的荣誉，表现出高尚的革命品质和英雄主义气概。
    我首先要提到休养员孙晋民同志，他的两足和双手残废了，双目失明了，美国强盗的炮火可以摧残他的身体，但不能够损伤他思想上的健康。他经常向别的伤员说：“我虽然身体残废了，但我的思想并没有残废。我永远不能忘记对美帝国主义的仇恨，我的耳朵可以听，嘴还能说话，只要我的心在跳动，我就能继续和美国侵略者进行斗争。”他对一日千里地飞速进步着的祖国怀着强烈的爱和希望，对生活充满乐趣。他用心地听医院工作人员读书、读报，进行学习，他也生动地向她们讲述战场上的英勇故事。他有时兴致勃勃地去参加电影、话剧晚会，他告诉别人：“虽然看不见，我听得到，能领会剧中的感情，也能接受教育啊！”许多轻伤员同志更是日夜盼望着早日返回朝鲜前线。赵德柱同志身上还有几小块弹片未取出，但已能活动了，便制了一支木枪，在庭院里经常练习刺杀动作。有个伤员仔细地存放着自己的血衣。别人问他：“留这脏衣干什么？”他总这样回答：“我要经常记着美国强盗的罪恶，我要把它带回朝鲜去，向美国强盗讨还这笔血债！”
    当毛泽东选集出版的时候，住在南京的休养员争先恐后地去购买。在各个医院里，他们普遍地组织了政治、文化的学习。他们求知的心情比农民盼望庄稼生长还迫切。顾荣和郑挺同志的手残废了，他们把笔绑在胳膊上练习写字。戴佑临同志双足残废了，他依然积极地领导俱乐部的工作，鼓励和帮助伤病员同志写稿，和他在一起休养的同志都写了很多稿子。有一个做过连队文化教员的同志，两只手都截去了，他读书的时候用两只胳膊捧着书看，虽然这样不方便，他读书却非常努力。他常领着大伙唱歌，使病房里充满着愉快的气氛。
    和火线上一样，志愿军休养员之间，休养员和医院工作人员之间，都发扬了高度的阶级友爱。某院三十三号病房里，住着三个重伤员和七个轻伤员，轻伤员经常用小车推着重伤员去散步。王新福同志的右手截去了三个手指，他为了减少护士们的疲劳，常把饭菜打来，一碗碗地盛好送到重伤同志面前。有次某院来了三个重伤员，伤势很重，在痛苦地呻吟着。护士们听说手术队长决定要输血，便一窝蜂地涌上去报名，很短时间内，就输了一千二百CC的鲜血，及时挽救了这三个伤员的生命。祖国人民是以这样崇高的爱来爱护我们的志愿军伤员！休养员们也以同样的心情关怀护理人员。为了减少护理人员的疲劳，休养员常主动地帮助他们扫地、打饭，和做些洗痰盂等轻微劳动。有一次，医生杨德仁忙了一夜没有休息，第二天一早，休养员周玉山、王新发爬起来，到伙房打来洗脸水，悄悄地放在他的住室里。休养员的模范行动又鼓励了和推动了护理人员的工作积极性。看护员项芝华曾感动地说：“我工作一累的时候，只要一想起你们就有了力量，你们这样照顾我们，我们怎能不更好的看护你们呢？”
    二月五日寄自南京
