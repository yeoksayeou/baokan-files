The American aggressors, devoid of humanity, are dragging out the negotiations while violating human justice and international law. They have continuously and extensively used aircraft to scatter various germ-carrying insects spreading bacteria over our front-line positions and rear areas in Korea, attempting to poison peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean People's forces on a large scale. Not only that, but they have also colluded with the major war criminals who should have been arrested and handed over to the International Tribunal for conducting bacteriological warfare during the Japanese imperialist invasion of China—former Japanese Army Medical Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, Veterinary Major General Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano—to carry out these inhumane acts. Furthermore, they even use captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army for bacteriological experiments. We express our grave protest against these heinous crimes that outrage both humans and gods.

We Chinese scientific workers have further realized from this how the American warmongers are using science as a tool for their aggressive wars. The heinous American warmongers once used atomic energy to slaughter humans on a massive scale and to blackmail and intimidate people who demand peace; they have thrown potato beetles to damage the crops of the German Democratic Republic and other people's democratic countries, and have long been researching and manufacturing bacterial weapons for the slaughter of humankind. The American aggressors, under the resolute attack of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, have shamefully released poison gas many times in violation of international law; and now they are attempting to use "bacteria" to salvage the disastrous situation on the Korean battlefield, which they can no longer salvage. These bloody facts of using science to carry out the massacre of humankind clearly prove that American imperialism is not only the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, but also the deadly enemy of humankind and scientific culture.

These crimes prove that the frantic enemy's delay in the Korean armistice negotiations is to prepare for a more cruel war. However, we must point out that the just war of opposing aggression and defending peace will surely be victorious. It is very clear that American imperialism is now following the old path of German and Japanese fascism and will surely be condemned and severely punished by the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.

    抗议侵朝美军的滔天罪行

    灭绝人性的美国侵略军，一面拖延谈判，一面违反人类正义和国际公法，在朝鲜我军前线阵地和后方，用飞机连续大量撒放传布细菌的各种毒虫，妄图大规模地毒害朝鲜和平居民和朝中人民部队，不仅如此，并且还勾结早应加以逮捕交国际法庭审判的日本帝国主义侵略中国时期进行细菌战的大战犯——前日本陆军军医中将石井四郎，兽医少将若松次郎和北野政藏等，来干这些惨无人道的勾当。不仅如此，竟以中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军被俘人员来进行细菌试验，我们对于这些令人发指的滔天罪行，提出严重抗议。
    我们中国科学工作者们，由此进一步认识到美国战争贩子们怎样地用科学作为他们进行侵略战争的工具，罪大恶极的美国战争贩子，曾经将原子能用来大规模屠杀人类和敲诈恫吓要求和平的人民；曾经投掷马铃薯甲虫来损害德意志民主共和国等人民民主国家的农作物，并且长期地研究和制造屠杀人类的细菌武器。美国侵略军在中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军的坚决打击下，曾经多次地违反国际公法可耻地施放毒气；而现在又妄图以“细菌”来挽救它在朝鲜战场上已经无法挽救的惨败局面。这些利用科学来进行惨杀人类的血腥事实，都明白地证明了美帝国主义不仅是中国人民的死敌，同时也是人类和科学文化的死敌。
    这些罪行证明疯狂的敌人拖延朝鲜停战谈判就是为了准备更残酷的战争。但是，我们必须指出：反对侵略保卫和平的正义战争是一定要胜利的。很显然地，美帝国主义现在正在走着德、日法西斯的老路，一定要受到中朝人民和全世界和平人民的声讨和严厉的制裁。
