    The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee's decision to expel Yi Jiguang, former member of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and Deputy Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, from the Party is completely correct and necessary. Although Yi Jiguang was a Party member with twenty years of service, had engaged in arduous struggles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, had been imprisoned, and had made certain contributions to the people, he had been corrupted by bourgeois ideology during his work in Wuhan and had become a criminal who indulged in pleasure, lived a decadent life, and abused public funds by using his power. This led to the loss of his political stance, treating enemies as friends, trusting, promoting, and protecting counter-revolutionaries, while hating, oppressing, and expelling class brothers. In his work, he violated the Party's policies and acted arbitrarily and autocratically. For his own despicable selfish desires, he adopted vicious means in his cadre policy, promoting, accommodating, and taking care of those who were obedient and flattering, while attacking, excluding, and suppressing those who were loyal to the Party's cause and adhered to the Party's principles, leaving an extremely bad influence among the broad masses and cadres. All of this shows that Yi Jiguang had lost the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member and must be expelled from the Party; otherwise, the purity and seriousness of the Party's organization would be undermined.

    However, some people still harbor certain inappropriate doubts about the Party's decision.

    Some say: "Although Yi Jiguang's mistakes are very serious, he can still be retained in the Party for continued education and transformation." This statement is clearly wrong. Judging from Yi Jiguang's degeneration and inability to distinguish between friend and foe, Yi Jiguang's outlook on life has completely deviated from the fighting communist principles. He believes that "life" is about enjoyment and corruption. If not, it seems that it is not worth living. Therefore, he is not satisfied with his extravagant life, and often says, "This life is too hard, you don't know how to take care of the chief." This means that he no longer has any trace of a Communist Party member. He has become a dangerous person who spreads bourgeois ideological influence within the Party and corrupts the Party. For a degenerate element like Yi Jiguang, if he is not given the punishment of expulsion from the Party, it is tantamount to abandoning the arms of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and the discipline of the Party, and it is tantamount to condoning the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie.

    The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee's expulsion of Yi Jiguang from the Party precisely shows that our Party is a Party with strict discipline. This concrete fact can educate all Party members, so that every Party member recognizes that they must constantly strive to maintain the ideological and organizational purity of the Party and must never tolerate the erosion of bourgeois ideology. Only in this way can the Party maintain its role as the vanguard of the working class. To be a glorious Communist Party member, one must wholeheartedly and devotedly strive for the cause of communism for the rest of one's life. Damaging the interests of the revolution to satisfy personal desires will inevitably lead to a shameful end like Yi Jiguang.

    Some say: "Yi Jiguang is an old Party member and has contributed to the revolution. Although he has done some bad things, he should be given a lighter punishment." This is not right. Precisely because Yi Jiguang is an old Party member who holds a responsible position, the Party and the people should have higher demands on him. He should not only possess the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member, but also have higher standards. Yi Jiguang did not treat himself with the Party's high principles; on the contrary, he turned his personal contributions to the revolution into a burden, became complacent, and this emotion inevitably became the object of bourgeois ideological corrosion. Therefore, for those who do bad things by relying on their merits, they must be dealt with in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions at the Seventeenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), that is, "to remove them from their leading positions without hesitation, no matter what merits they had in the past. ... This must be done in order to break the arrogant habits of these self-important dignitaries and bureaucrats, and to make them behave themselves. This must be done in order to consolidate Party discipline and Soviet discipline in our entire work." (Leninism Problems, page 637)

    Some say: "Yi Jiguang is a member of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the CCP. Why didn't the Municipal Committee carry out ideological struggle in the past, so that Yi Jiguang made mistake after mistake, and finally was expelled from the Party?" First of all, we need to affirm that Yi Jiguang's mistakes should be his own responsibility. Obviously, a Party member like Yi Jiguang certainly does not not know the Party's principles, and certainly cannot not know that Chairman Mao had already put forward the instruction at the Second Plenary Session that the whole Party should be vigilant against the bourgeoisie's attack. However, because Yi Jiguang was weak-willed and could not withstand the erosion of bourgeois ideology, he blindly pursued personal enjoyment and gradually became corrupt and degenerate, letting the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets" destroy himself. On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that within the Wuhan Party organization, in order to oppose Yi Jiguang's erroneous thoughts and behaviors, many Party members also launched fierce struggles with Yi Jiguang. Some Party members were therefore detained by Yi Jiguang, or transferred to work, or removed from their Party positions. Can this be said that the Party did not engage in struggle with Yi Jiguang? The problem is obviously that Yi Jiguang insisted on his mistakes, which led to his disgrace.

    Of course, this does not mean that the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee has no responsibility for this issue. On the issue of Yi Jiguang, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee should also seriously examine their bureaucratic errors and examine their decadent liberalism in condoning the existence and development of various errors.

### 武汉市委开除易吉光的党籍是完全正确的

    武汉市委开除易吉光的党籍是完全正确的
    沈馨
    中国共产党武汉市委员会开除原武汉市委委员、武汉市人民政府副市长易吉光党籍的决定是完全正确的、必要的。易吉光虽然是有着二十年党龄的党员，曾在国民党统治区进行过艰苦的斗争，坐过监狱，对人民有过一定的贡献，但在武汉市工作期间，已经被资产阶级的思想所腐蚀，成为贪图享受，生活腐化，利用职权滥用公款的罪人。并由此发展到丧失政治立场，以敌为友；对反革命分子信任，提拔，包庇；对阶级弟兄则仇视，欺压，驱逐。在工作中，则是违反党的政策，个人独断专行。为了个人的卑鄙私欲，在干部政策上，采用恶毒的手段，对顺从逢迎者则提拔，迁就，照顾；对于忠实于党的事业、坚持党的原则者，则打击，排挤，压制，在广大群众和干部中留下了极其恶劣的影响。这些都说明易吉光失掉了作为共产党员的起码条件，必须开除出党；否则就破坏了党的组织的纯洁性和严肃性。
    但是有些人对于党的这个决定仍然抱着某些不应有的怀疑。
    有人说：“易吉光的错误虽然十分严重，但尚可留在党内继续教育改造。”这种说法显然是错误的。从易吉光堕落蜕化，敌我不分等错误来看，易吉光的人生观已经完全离开了战斗的共产主义原则，他认为“人生”就是享乐腐化，不这样，似乎人活在世上是不值得的。因而他对他的奢侈生活还不满足，常说“这生活太苦了，你们不会照顾首长”。这就是说，他已经没有一点共产党员的气味，他已经变成在党内散播资产阶级思想影响，腐蚀党的危险人物。对于易吉光这样的蜕化分子，如不给以开除党籍的处分，就等于放弃了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的武装和党的纪律，就等于纵容资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
    武汉市委开除易吉光出党，正说明我们的党是有着严格纪律的党，这一具体事实可以教育全体党员，使每个党员认识必须时时刻刻为保持党的思想上组织上的纯洁性而奋斗，绝不能容忍资产阶级思想的侵蚀。只有这样，党才能保持工人阶级的先锋队的作用。作一个光荣的共产党员，必须是全心全意地终身为共产主义事业奋斗。损害革命利益以满足个人欲求，必然遭到像易吉光这样可耻的结局。
    有人说：“易吉光是一个老党员，对革命有过功绩，虽然作了些坏事，但应从轻处分。”这是不对的。正因为易吉光是一个担任负责工作的老党员，党和人民对他就应当有更高的要求。他不但应当具备一个共产党员的起码条件，而且要有更高的标准。易吉光没有用党的高度原则性对待自己；相反的，他把个人对革命的某些功绩变成包袱，骄傲自满，而这种情绪也就必然成为资产阶级思想腐蚀的对象。因此对于倚仗自己功绩作坏事的人，就必须按照斯大林同志在联共（布）第十七次代表会议上的指示来处理，即“毫无迟疑地撤销他们的领导职务，不管他们从前有过怎样的功劳。……其所以必须这样办，是因为必须打破这些妄自尊大的显贵官僚的傲慢习气，叫他们安分守己。其所以必须这样办，是因为要在我们整个工作中巩固党的纪律和苏维埃的纪律。”（列宁主义问题六三七页）
    有人说：“易吉光是中共武汉市委委员。市委会内部过去为什么不开展思想斗争，以致使易吉光一错再错，终至开除党籍？”我们首先需要肯定，易吉光的错误应当由他自己来负责。很显然，易吉光这样的党员决不是不知道党的原则的，也决不能不知道毛主席早在二中全会上即已提出全党应警惕资产阶级进攻的指示。但是因为易吉光意志薄弱，经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，一味追求个人享受，逐渐腐化堕落，让资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”毁灭了自己。另一方面也应当指出：在武汉市党的组织内，为了反对易吉光的这种错误思想和行为，也曾有不少党员和易吉光展开了激烈的斗争。有些党员因此被易吉光扣押起来，或被调动工作，或被撤销党内职务。这能说党没有和易吉光进行过斗争吗？问题显然是在于易吉光坚持自己的错误，以致发展到了身败名裂的地步。
    当然，这并不是说武汉市委对这一问题就没有责任了。在易吉光的问题上，武汉市委同样应当严肃地检讨他们所犯的官僚主义错误，检讨他们纵容各种错误存在和发展的腐朽的自由主义。
