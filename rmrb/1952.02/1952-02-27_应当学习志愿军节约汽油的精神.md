    Should Learn from the Spirit of the Volunteer Army in Conserving Gasoline
    Editor: On the third of this month, the "Our Great Motherland" section of the People's Daily published a photo of Volunteer Army soldiers saving gasoline in extremely difficult combat conditions. This photo powerfully educated me and encouraged my enthusiasm for the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy on the streets. Volunteer Army soldiers were unwilling to discard even a drop of oil from the bottom of a gasoline barrel. However, some cadres in the Civil Aviation Administration casually took airplanes, used airplanes to send sports teams and carry fruit; casually used cars to pick up and drop off guests, go to the theater, get haircuts, and stroll in the park. In nine months, the entire bureau used more than 59,000 gallons of gasoline. Comparing this wasteful situation with the Volunteer Army's frugality shows how much we are letting down the Volunteer Army.
    The Volunteer Army is a very good example for us. We must use this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to examine the heartbreaking waste events of the past. We must clarify our thinking and cherish gasoline properly, not allowing a single drop of the motherland's gasoline to be wasted!

    应当学习志愿军节约汽油的精神
    编辑同志：本月三日人民日报“我们伟大的祖国”栏内刊登了一张志愿军战士在极端艰苦的战斗环境中节省汽油的照片。这张照片有力地教育了我，鼓舞了我在街头宣传反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的热情。志愿军战士不肯丢弃汽油桶底的一滴油。但是民航局的某些干部，随便乘坐飞机，拿飞机送球队和带水果；随便乘汽车接送客人、看戏、理发、逛公园，在九个月中，全局用油达五万九千多加仑。把这种浪费的情形和志愿军节约的情形对比一下，就可以知道是如何地对不起志愿军。
    志愿军是我们很好的榜样，我们一定要通过这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，检查过去痛心的浪费事件，我们要在思想上明确起来，好好爱惜汽油，不让祖国的汽油有一滴浪费！  周潞
