Hebei Provincial People's Court Publicly Tries Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
Sentences Two Major Embezzlers Liu and Zhang to Death and Immediate Execution

The major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were sentenced to death and executed on February 10th after a public trial.

The Hebei Provincial People's Public Trial of major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan was held at 12:00 noon on the 10th. The Hebei Provincial People's Court, in accordance with the order of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, organized a temporary court for the public trial. The Hebei Provincial People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the proceedings live to the entire province. A total of 21,800 people attended the meeting, including staff members of government agencies, Party organs, and people's organizations in Hebei Province and Baoding City, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and people's representatives from all cities, special districts, and counties under the province's jurisdiction. Representatives of disaster victims from Tianjin Special District, who suffered direct exploitation by the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, were also invited by the People's Government to attend the meeting.

The major embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan was exposed at the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province last November. The Hebei Provincial People's Government then arrested the two criminals, and the Hebei Provincial People's Government's People's Supervision Committee, the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, and other relevant agencies formed an "Investigation and Handling Committee for the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan Case." After two months of investigation and interrogation, all the facts of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's embezzlement crimes have been thoroughly investigated and a great deal of conclusive evidence has been obtained.

The public trial was presided over by Zhang Qingchun, a member of the Hebei Provincial Thrift Inspection Committee. In his speech, Zhang Qingchun pointed out that the reason why Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan are being publicly tried by the people today is because they are not ordinary major embezzlers, but major criminals who have betrayed the Party, the country, and the people under the erosion of bourgeois corrupt and degenerate ideas. The people have long hoped that the government would give these two major criminals the punishment they deserve, and today's meeting will answer the people's just demands.

The meeting then proceeded with Song Zhiyi, President of the Hebei Provincial People's Court and Presiding Judge of the Temporary Court, announcing that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan would be tried. At this time, the two despicable traitors were escorted into the venue by the People's Police to await the people's accusations and the court's judgment. Under the gaze of thousands of angry eyes, these two thieves who stole state assets and betrayed the interests of the people stood insignificantly before the people. Xue Xun, Deputy Director of the "Investigation and Handling Committee for the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan Case," then presented the facts of the two criminals' crimes to the meeting. Xue Xun accused: Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan formerly served as the main responsible cadres of the Communist Party and the People's Government in the Tianjin area, but in order to greedily pursue despicable personal enjoyment, they dared to disregard national law, Party discipline, national defense construction, and the people's suffering. They reached out everywhere to steal disaster relief grain, river project grain, airport construction fees, local grain, relief grain for cadres' families, wages for river management laborers, bank loans, and other state assets and the people's blood and sweat, amounting to 17.16272 billion yuan (previous reports stated that their theft figure was 15.54954 billion yuan, this number is the final investigated statistic). They colluded lawlessly with unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculation and sabotage, causing the state to lose as much as 2.1 billion yuan in assets in a single transaction where they handed over 4.9 billion yuan to the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Wenyi for reselling steel. Due to their exploitation of the river management laborers' blood and sweat, no fewer than ten laborers are now known to have become sick, disabled, or even died due to poor food and excessive labor. Xue Xun continued to accuse: Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan squandered and wasted the proceeds of theft and illegal operations, leading a despicable and corrupt life, frequently entertaining guests and giving gifts, spending tens, hundreds, or even tens of millions of yuan at a time. Liu Qingshan even degenerated to the point of becoming addicted to drugs. In less than half a year, the two of them embezzled and squandered more than 370 million yuan. After exhaustively accusing Liu and Zhang of their serious crimes of violating laws and regulations, Xue Xun angrily pointed out that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, under the influence and enticement of the bourgeois ideology of harming others to benefit oneself, had completely transformed from revolutionary fighters into traitors of the Communist Party, the country, and the people. She, on behalf of the Investigation and Handling Committee, requested the temporary court to sentence Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan to death and execute them immediately. Sun Shulin, a representative of disaster victims from Huangzhuang Town, Baodi County, Tianjin Special District, who had been exploited by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, accused Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan of deducting disaster victims' boat-building fees, causing the disaster victims to become displaced and flee from famine. He said sadly: "In the river repair in 1950, the higher authorities called for work-for-relief, but the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan did not implement the instructions of the higher authorities. Our village alone had 4,430 jin of rice deducted. And that's not all, they replaced the good grain with bad corn flour and millet, causing many people to get sick. More than a dozen people in our village got sick." After accusing Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan of their criminal facts, Sun Shulin raised his fist and demanded that the temporary court shoot Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. At this time, applause thundered throughout the venue, and the entire audience shouted: "Demand the execution of the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan!" "Resolutely repulse the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive!"

After the accusation, Song Zhiyi, President of the Hebei Provincial People's Court and Presiding Judge of the Temporary Court, announced the verdict: Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan are sentenced to death and executed immediately, and all the property of the two criminals is confiscated; the other criminals in the same case will be tried separately. At this point, slogans of "Support the honest and upright People's Government," "Support the glorious and great Communist Party," and "Long live Chairman Mao" resounded throughout the venue.

Finally, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, spoke. He called on all cadres and the people of the province to learn the lessons they should from the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan case, and to recognize the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive over the past three years. Yang Xiufeng said: In order to welcome the country's economic construction, we must raise our vigilance, unite as one, and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive. In the resolute fight to encircle and suppress major embezzlers and major thieves, I hope everyone will continue to make persistent efforts and never stop until complete victory is achieved.

    河北省人民法院公审刘青山张子善
    对刘张两大贪污犯判处死刑并立即执行
    大贪污犯刘青山、张子善已在二月十日经公审后处以死刑。
    河北省人民公审大贪污犯刘青山、张子善大会在十日上午十二时举行。河北省人民法院遵照中央人民政府最高人民法院命令，组织了临时法庭进行公审。河北省人民广播电台向全省各地广播了大会实况。参加大会的共有二万一千八百多人，包括河北省、保定市的政府机关、党的机关和人民团体的工作人员，人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员，全省所属各市、各专区、各县的人民代表。遭受大贪污犯刘青山、张子善直接剥削的天津专区的灾民代表也由人民政府邀请参加了大会。
    刘青山、张子善二犯的大贪污案在去年十一月中共河北省党的第三次代表会议中被揭发后，河北省人民政府便将二犯逮捕，并由河北省人民政府人民监察委员会、河北省人民检察署等有关机关组成了“刘青山、张子善案件”调查处理委员会，经过两月来的调查、侦讯，刘青山、张子善的全部贪污犯罪事实都已彻底调查清楚，并获得了很多确凿证据。
    公审大会由河北省节约检查委员会委员张庆春任主席。张庆春在讲话中指出：刘青山、张子善今天所以被人民公审，是因为他们不是什么普通的大贪污犯，而是在资产阶级腐化堕落思想侵蚀之下，叛党、叛国、叛人民的大罪犯。人民久已盼望政府给予这两个大罪犯以应得的处分，今天的大会就要回答人民的正义要求。
    大会继由河北省人民法院院长、临时法庭审判长宋志毅宣布刘青山、张子善受审。这时，这两个可耻的叛徒即由人民警察押入会场，听候人民的控诉和法庭的审判。在全场千万双愤怒的眼睛注视下，这两个盗窃国家资财、叛变人民利益的蟊贼，渺小地站在人民的面前。“刘青山、张子善案件”调查处理委员会副主任薛迅当即将二犯的罪恶事实向大会进行了控诉。薛迅控诉说：刘青山、张子善二犯前在天津地区任共产党、人民政府的主要负责干部，但他们为了贪图可耻的个人享受，竟胆敢不顾国法、党纪，不顾国防建设、人民疾苦，对救灾粮、河工粮、飞机场建筑费、地方粮、干部家属救济粮、治河民工工资、银行贷款等国家资财、人民血汗，到处伸手盗窃，为数达一百七十一亿六千二百七十二万元（前报道其盗窃数字为一百五十五亿四千九百五十四万元，此数系最后调查的统计）。他们无法无天地勾结奸商，投机破坏，仅在一次交给奸商张文义四十九亿元使他倒卖钢铁中，即使国家资财损失二十一亿元之多。由于他们对治河民工的血汗剥削，使民工因食品恶劣、劳动过重而病残以至死亡的，据现在知道的不下十人。薛迅继续控诉说：刘青山、张子善以盗窃和非法经营所得，大肆挥霍浪费，过着可耻的腐化堕落生活，经常请客、送礼，动辄数十、百万以至千万元。刘青山竟至堕落到吸食毒品成瘾。不到半年，他们二人竟贪污、挥霍达三亿七千多万元。薛迅在详尽地控诉了刘、张二犯违法乱纪的严重罪行之后，愤怒地指出：刘青山、张子善在资产阶级的损人利己的思想侵袭引诱之下，由革命战士完全变成了共产党、国家和人民的叛徒。她代表调查处理委员会要求临时法庭判处刘青山、张子善以死刑，并立即执行。天津专区宝坻县黄庄镇被刘青山、张子善二犯所剥削的灾民代表孙树林，在会上控诉了刘青山、张子善克扣灾民造船费，致使灾民流离逃荒的罪行。他沉痛地说：“在一九五○年修河时，上级是叫以工代赈，可是刘青山、张子善大贪污犯不执行上级的指示，光俺村就克扣了四千四百三十斤米。这还不算，又把好粮食给俺们换成坏棒子面和小米，好多人都吃得生病了，俺一村就病了十多个。”孙树林在控诉了刘青山、张子善的罪恶事实后，高举拳头要求临时法庭枪毙刘青山、张子善。这时，会场掌声雷动，全场高呼：“要求处决大贪污犯刘青山、张子善！”“坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻！”
    控诉后，河北省人民法院院长、临时法庭审判长宋志毅宣判：刘青山、张子善判处死刑，立即执行，并没收该二犯全部财产；同案各犯另行审判。至此，“拥护廉洁奉公的人民政府”、“拥护光荣、伟大的共产党”和“毛主席万岁”的口号声响遍全场。
    最后，河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰讲话。他号召全省干部和全省人民要从刘青山、张子善案件中取得应有的教训，要认识到资产阶级三年来猖狂进攻的严重性。杨秀峰说：为了迎接国家的经济建设，我们必须提高警惕，团结一致，坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。在坚决围剿大贪污犯和大盗窃犯的斗争中，希望大家再接再厉，不获全胜，决不收兵。
