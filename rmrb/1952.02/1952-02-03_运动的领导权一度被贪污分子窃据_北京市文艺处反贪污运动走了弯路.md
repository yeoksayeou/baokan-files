    The Leadership of the Movement Once Usurped by Grafters
    The Anti-Corruption Movement in the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture Went Astray
    Leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture failed for a considerable period of time to recognize the serious political significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. They handed over the leadership of the movement to grafters, preventing the movement from progressing smoothly.
    Zhang Yishan (Communist Party member), since January of the year before last, served as the chief of the secretariat section in the Bureau of Culture. Under his vigorous advocacy and direction, the Bureau of Culture, starting from 1950, illegally engaged in transportation business with a truck. For two whole years, there were no receipts for income and expenditure. He colluded with the driver Liang Qiying and the driver's assistant Wang Zongwen in embezzlement. In July of last year alone, they embezzled over ten million yuan from the income of the automobile transportation business. Zhang Yishan also colluded with private merchants and evaded national taxes. According to the preliminary materials investigated from the Yanfeng Automobile Firm alone, over thirteen million yuan in taxes were evaded. All construction and other affairs managed by Zhang Yishan were contracted out to private merchants. These private merchants were all his relatives and fellow villagers. They colluded with each other, issued fake invoices, and sold public grain to private merchants at low prices, jointly stealing state property. Under Zhang Yishan's direct leadership, over 90% of the people in the secretariat section who managed money embezzled.
    When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement had just begun, some staff members of the Bureau of Culture raised questions about the unclear accounts of the automobile transportation business, the lack of receipts for expenditure, and the unsound financial system of the secretariat section. They demanded that the secretariat section and Zhang Yishan be the focus of the anti-corruption movement, and that the automobile transportation accounts and other issues of the secretariat section be thoroughly investigated. However, the leading cadres of the Bureau of Culture actually handed over the real power to control the movement to Zhang Yishan, allowing him to serve as the deputy director of the Bureau of Culture's Thrift Examination Committee Office. As a result, Zhang Yishan was able to deceive his superiors and mislead his subordinates, stirring up trouble and shifting the target of the struggle to a few not-so-serious extravagant and wasteful incidents involving individual personnel and other departments. Under these circumstances, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the Bureau of Culture, which began on December 22nd of last year, was declared "basically over" by January 4th of this year (actually it was basically aborted). During this period, only a few odd-job workers confessed to some problems. Starting from January 5th, all departments except the secretariat section and the opera reform section returned to their daily work. At this time, the leading cadres of the Bureau of Culture completely handed over the anti-corruption movement of the secretariat section and the opera reform section to Zhang Yishan to "take charge," making Zhang Yishan and other grafters in the secretariat section feel that they could get through the "checkpoint," and therefore they confessed to nothing.
    After January 9th, under the pressure of the masses inside and outside the Bureau of Culture, Wang Zhenqiu and Qian Daoliu, grafters of the secretariat section of the Bureau of Culture, were forced to confess their crimes of corruption, and Zhang Yishan's mask was further exposed. The masses resolutely demanded the removal of Zhang Yishan from his position as deputy director of the Bureau of Culture's Thrift Examination Committee Office, which he had usurped, and a thorough investigation of Zhang Yishan's crimes. On January 12th, the leading cadres of the Bureau of Culture removed Zhang Yishan's leadership over this movement and re-mobilized all staff members to return to the anti-corruption struggle. After removing this obstacle, the movement in the Bureau of Culture was "brought back to life," the enthusiasm of the masses was high, and they actively exposed Zhang Yishan's crimes. The leading cadres of the Bureau of Culture also personally took action, organizing forces to conduct investigations and research, and initially confirmed some of Zhang Yishan's crimes.
    On January 22nd, the Bureau of Culture convened a meeting of all staff members, where the leading cadres made a public self-criticism regarding this incident, and announced on the spot the removal of Zhang Yishan from his position as chief of the secretariat section, ordering him to await investigation and punishment. Currently, the movement is developing vigorously. (Zeng Pu)

    运动的领导权一度被贪污分子窃据  
    北京市文艺处反贪污运动走了弯路
    北京市人民政府文教局文艺处的领导干部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，在相当长期内没有认识这个运动的严重的政治意义，把运动的领导权交给贪污分子，使运动不能顺利前进。
    张一山（共产党员）从前年一月起，在文艺处任秘书科科长。在他的极力主张和主持下，文艺处从一九五○年起，用一辆卡车非法经营运输业务，整整两年中，收支都没有单据。他和司机梁启英、司机助手王宗文从中共同作弊。如仅在去年七月份一个月，他们就从汽车运输的收入中贪污了一千多万元。张一山还勾结私商、偷漏国税，仅从延丰汽车行查出的初步材料来看，就漏税一千三百多万元。张一山所经管的修建等事务，都找私商承办。这些私商都是他的亲戚、同乡等。他们狼狈为奸，开假发票，把公家食粮低价卖给私商，共同盗窃国家财物。在张一山的直接领导下，秘书科所属经管钱财的人，百分之九十以上都贪污。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动刚开始的时候，文艺处的一些工作人员就提出汽车运输业务的账目不清、经费收支没有单据、秘书科财务制度不健全等问题，要求以秘书科和张一山为反贪污运动的重点，彻底检查汽车运输账目及秘书科的其他问题。但是，文艺处的领导干部竟把掌握运动的实权交给了张一山，让他担任文艺处节约检查委员会办公室副主任的职务。于是，张一山得以欺上瞒下，兴风作浪，把斗争目标转移到个别人员和其他部门的几件并不很严重的铺张浪费事件上去。在这种情况下，文艺处的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，从去年十二月二十二日开始，到今年一月四日，便宣告“基本上结束”（实际是基本上夭折）。在这个期间，只有几个勤杂人员交代了一些问题。从一月五日开始，除了秘书科和戏曲改进科外，其他部门都转入了日常工作。这时，文艺处的领导干部又把秘书科和戏曲改进科的反贪污运动，完全交给张一山“负责”，使张一山和秘书科的其他贪污分子，觉得可以混过“关”去，因而什么也不交代。
    一月九日以后，文艺处秘书科的贪污分子王镇球和钱道骝在处内外群众的压力下，被迫交代了他们的贪污罪行，张一山的假面具才进一步被戳穿。群众坚决要求撤销张一山所窃据的文艺处节约检查委员会办公室副主任的职务，彻底检查张一山的罪行。文艺处的领导干部在一月十二日撤销了张一山对这个运动的领导权，重新动员全体工作人员回到反贪污的斗争中来。搬掉这块石头以后，文艺处的运动才“起死回生”，群众情绪高涨，纷纷揭发张一山的罪行。文艺处领导干部也亲自动手，组织力量进行调查研究，初步证实了张一山的一些罪行。
    一月二十二日，文艺处召开了全体工作人员大会，领导干部针对这一事件作了公开检讨，并当场宣布撤销张一山秘书科科长职务，让他听候清查处理。现在，运动正在猛烈开展。  （曾普）
