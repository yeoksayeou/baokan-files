    Basic Situation of Ethnic Work in the Central and Southern Region and Opinions on Future Work
    --Excerpts from a Speech at the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government
    Zhang Zhiyi, Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee

    I. Ethnic Situation

    The Central and Southern region is an area where the reactionary ruling class historically exerted strong control, and the policy of ethnic oppression was implemented more thoroughly and brutally than in other regions. Consequently, the various ethnic minorities in the Central and Southern region, accounting for about five percent of the total population, were forced to disperse into remote mountainous areas very early, and their settlements are very small. The fact that the minority peoples have been able to continue their struggle and survive to this day in the face of cruel oppression and harsh natural environments fully demonstrates that they are extremely excellent.

    One aspect of ethnic oppression was the seizure of land and economic plunder. The land of the various ethnic minorities in mixed-residence areas was mostly taken by Han landlords through trickery and coercion. In fact, the land and economy of the concentrated-residence areas were also directly or indirectly controlled by Han landlords. In addition, the minority areas in the Central and Southern region are small, located between large Han areas, and restricted by natural conditions, requiring them to export their local specialties in exchange for grain, salt, cloth, and other necessities. Therefore, the economy of the various minority areas in the Central and Southern region is closely linked to the economy of the Han areas.

    Historically, the reactionary ruling class implemented the policies of "using barbarians to control barbarians" and appeasement and assimilation, intentionally cultivating, buying off, and using a small number of scum among the various ethnic minorities as tools to oppress and exploit the people of these ethnicities. They also sowed discord among the people of the various ethnicities, created disputes, and carried out reactionary propaganda and education to achieve their aim of domination. As a result, the culture of the ethnic minorities could not develop normally, and even stagnated. However, due to the long-term contact and cultural exchange between the working people of the various ethnicities, this did not stop as the reactionary ruling class intended.

    The Kuomintang bandit gang even deliberately denied the existence of ethnic minorities. As a result of long-term oppression, discrimination, and forced assimilation, some minority peoples did not even dare to admit that they were ethnic minorities. In addition, the economic aggression of imperialism and the church aggression activities of the imperialists also poisoned the ethnic minorities politically, economically, and culturally.

    In order to resist the oppression of the reactionary rulers, the Han working people and the minority working people in the Central and Southern region have had many examples of common struggle in the revolution. From the First Domestic Revolutionary War until the national liberation, the Yao and Zhuang people of the Left and Right Rivers in Guangxi and the Li and Miao people of Hainan Island directly participated in the revolutionary war. They fought under the leadership of the Communist Party, and countless heroic deeds emerged.

    These facts powerfully illustrate that the reactionary ruling class, as well as imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang, etc., are the common enemies of all ethnic groups, and the interests of the working people of all ethnicities are consistent and indivisible.

    According to preliminary understanding, the ethnic minorities in the Central and Southern region include 16 ethnicities: Miao, Yao, Dong, Zhuang, Hui, Li, Mongolian, Manchu, Uyghur, Jewish, Lolo, She, Ling, Lai, Maonan, and Vietnamese. Among them, those belonging to the Zhuang language system include the Nong people, Pian people, Gao Gan people, Sha people, and Bo people. Those belonging to the Miao language system include the Gelao and Qiaojia people. Those belonging to the Yao language system include those who call themselves the Mountain people. If these are included, there are 24 ethnicities. Among these ethnicities, the Miao, Yao, Dong, Zhuang, Li, and Hui are relatively populous. The total number of Zhuang people is about 6 million; the total number of Miao people is about 480,000; the total number of Dong people is about 250,000; the total number of Yao people is about 460,000; the total number of Li people is about 300,000. The total number of Hui people is about 350,000. The total number of ethnic minorities in the region is about 8 to 9 million.

    Before liberation, the feudal exploitation relations in most areas of the ethnic minorities in the Central and Southern region appeared in the form of ethnic oppression: Han feudal landlords oppressed minority farmers, Han commercial usurers exploited minority specialty producers; in some areas, it was also manifested as a complex form of Zhuang and Dong landlord classes oppressing Miao and Yao farmers, and Li ruling classes oppressing Miao people. This has led to an imbalance in the political, economic, and cultural development of the various ethnicities. That is, the political, economic, and cultural situations of the same ethnicity are not the same in different regions.

    According to existing incomplete materials, the Zhuang and Dong societies have long remained on the basis of agricultural economy, and a large number of landlords have emerged. Class differentiation within the Yao and Li ethnicities is not very obvious, and most people are engaged in labor and production, and are mostly directly oppressed and exploited by the Han feudal landlord class. The Li people still use wooden plows in their production methods, and ironware is very rare. Production technology and production tools are quite backward. The social form of the Miao ethnicity is between the Zhuang and Dong and the Yao and Li ethnicities. In the past, the reactionary landlord class in western Hunan often colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang, and some were bandits for generations. For example, Long Yunfei, a giant bandit in western Hunan, etc., had the reputation of a "bandit family" and harmed the Miao people and other ethnic peoples very deeply. The Hui people mostly live in cities and near towns, and live with the Han people. They are generally engaged in small businesses or handicrafts, and a few are engaged in agriculture, and there are a few capitalists and landlords. The society of other ethnic minorities is basically the same as the Miao, Yao, or Li ethnicities if they live in concentrated communities, and the same as the Han people if they live scattered.

    Economically, the various ethnic minorities generally lack land and have small productivity. Production materials such as agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers, and living materials such as food, salt, and cloth are very scarce. Local specialties are subjected to unequal exchange and are not easy to sell, resulting in poverty, with an average shortage of food for three to five months each year. The sanitary conditions in the various ethnic minority areas are very poor, malaria is very harmful, there are many maternal and infant diseases, and the mortality rate is also very high.

    The people of the various ethnic minorities generally possess the excellent qualities of diligence, bravery, intelligence, and loyalty. They have overcome the natural environment of "sky-water fields" (small plots of wasteland opened on the mountains, cultivated by rainwater) and "hanging-card soil" (i.e., mountain slope fields with a steep slope of 75 to 80 degrees), resisted the reactionary rulers, and demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

    The above is an overview of the political, economic, cultural, and social conditions of the ethnic minorities in the Central and Southern region.

    II. Achievements and Shortcomings of Ethnic
      Work in the Central and Southern Region in the Past Two Years

    Based on the central government's ethnic policy and combined with the actual situation of the various ethnicities in the Central and Southern region, the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee has made strengthening the unity of the various ethnicities and stabilizing the lives of the people of the various ethnicities one of the central tasks. Over the past two years, through the propaganda and implementation of ethnic policies, as well as the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, equal, friendly, united, and mutually supportive relations have begun to be established among the various ethnicities. The people of the various ethnicities sincerely love Chairman Mao and have felt the warmth of the motherland family.

    The central government and the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee have successively sent visiting groups to the minority areas of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces, and with the assistance and participation of governments at all levels, have carried out propaganda, condolences, and other work, further strengthening ethnic unity.

    Secondly, they have suppressed the remnants of the Chiang bandit gang and historical banditry that plagued the minority areas the most: and timely measures have been taken to reduce or exempt public grain, and a large amount of grain, clothing, and loans have been allocated, combined with organizing production, to help the people of the various ethnicities overcome natural disasters; and they have obtained an unprecedented stable life. According to incomplete statistics, about 10 million jin of relief grain and loan grain have been distributed, amounting to hundreds of billions of yuan.

    Thirdly, people's representative conferences of all ethnicities and all circles have been held one to three times in the various ethnic areas, and representatives of the various ethnicities have been generally, and even disproportionately to the population, absorbed to participate in various representative conferences. Ethnic minority cadres participate in general district and township governments; some ethnic minority cadres have become district chiefs, township chiefs, county chiefs, or deputy county chiefs. Many ethnic minority cadres have also been absorbed into trade, cultural and educational, and other departments. The work of ethnic democratic construction has been completed in Longsheng County in Guangxi, Tongdao County in Hunan, and the Dayao Mountain area in Guangxi; and many counties, districts, and townships are preparing for the construction of ethnic democratic regimes. These have created favorable conditions for the construction and development of the various ethnicities.

    Fourthly, in the mixed-residence areas, ethnic minority farmers and Han farmers have carried out the movements of opposing local tyrants, reducing rent and returning deposits, and land reform together, fairly and reasonably distributing the fruits of struggle and land. It has solved the main difficulties in their production and life, and laid the foundation for the development and progress of the minority peoples.

    Fifthly, in agriculture, forestry, and trade, state-owned trading companies have strived to establish many trading organizations in the various ethnic areas, fairly and reasonably adjusted prices, and maintained the stability of prices. They have purchased a large amount of local specialties and supplied a large amount of necessities, such as salt, grain, and cloth.

    Sixthly, in terms of culture, education, and health, the cultural, educational, and health departments of governments at all levels have strived to restore old primary schools and establish new primary schools in the various ethnic areas, run night schools, literacy classes, and cadre training classes, and set up public-funded quotas for ethnic minority students in middle schools. The Central and Southern region has established an ethnic college, Guangdong has established an ethnic class in Southern University (and is preparing to establish an ethnic college), and Hunan Revolutionary University has ethnic cadre classes. In addition to being free of charge, ethnic minority students are given appropriate consideration in terms of admission standards, life, and study. In terms of health work, health organizations have been established, and medical teams and epidemic prevention teams have been sent to ethnic areas to carry out work. Some areas have carried out livestock epidemic prevention and treatment work. The Hunan visiting group of the Central Visiting Group conducted mobile medical treatment in various ethnic areas, held short-term health training classes, and gave some medicines to the ethnic minorities.

    The experiences and lessons of the past two years have proved that there are still many comrades working in the minority areas who are not good at grasping ethnic policies, and are not good at combining the characteristics of the current stage of development of the local ethnicities and the requirements of the majority of people to carry out work. In addition, most of the cadres above the county level in the ethnic areas come from outside, and they have rarely or never been in contact with ethnic minorities in the past, and most of the cadres below the township level are new cadres, so it is easy for errors of Han chauvinism or narrow nationalism to occur unconsciously among the cadres. For example, on the issue of ethnic democratic construction, some comrades believe that the request to implement regional autonomy is the minority peoples "making trouble for division" and "making trouble for sectarianism," "the People's Government is for the people, and it is for the people of all ethnicities, why bother with autonomy or not!" Others believe that "a large number of ethnic minority cadres have already been absorbed to participate in the government work, and in fact it has already been autonomous." Therefore, they take an unpractical and unserious attitude towards promoting the policy of regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united government.

    In carrying out land reform or social reform work, some places rigidly copied the experience of the Han areas, enforced orders, regardless of the degree of awareness of the minority peoples, and did not rely on ethnic minority cadres. For example, in individual places, in carrying out the work of going down the mountain to distribute fields, without full consultation between Han farmers and ethnic minority farmers living in the mountains, the fields were distributed impatiently. As a result, ethnic minority farmers lived at the foot of the mountain for a month or two and then moved back to the mountains. The publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law have also been forcibly implemented regardless of the objective situation, causing dissatisfaction among the ethnic minority masses. In terms of cultivating and using cadres, there has been an overemphasis on political and cultural level and background and composition, and some newly promoted ethnic cadres have been arranged in inappropriate work positions.

    Another manifestation of the remnants of Han chauvinism is the distrust of the ethnic minority peoples, and the failure to go deep into the ethnic minority masses, emphasizing difficulties, fearing to cause trouble, using the excuse of language barriers and unfamiliarity with the situation, not publicizing ethnic policies, putting ethnic work aside, passively waiting, and not asking questions.

    The above-mentioned shortcomings of neglecting ethnic characteristics, not paying attention to ethnic relations, and generalizing working methods, form fear of trouble but more trouble, fear of detours but detours, which are the results of neglecting ethnic policies and lacking a mass viewpoint.

    The narrow nationalist bias caused by long-term historical reasons should also be valued. For example, some people say: "If there is regional autonomy, our ethnicity will be劃one area, and we don't want Han people," "copper does not touch iron, Miao does not touch guests," blind conservatism, exclusive thinking, etc., also hinder ethnic unity and the progress and development of their own ethnicity.

    Judging from the current situation in the Central and Southern region, the most important and most common of the above two biases is the former, that is, the residual influence of Han chauvinism.

    Secondly, the ethnic work in the Central and Southern region still has a chaotic phenomenon of no planning and no steps in many specific tasks. For example, underpricing and rushing to buy timber in minority areas has caused a lot of losses to the ethnic minorities and left a bad impression.

    Although these shortcomings are difficult to avoid in the development process, we must face them squarely and correct them in time.

    III. Tasks of Ethnic Work in the Central and Southern Region in the Future

    According to the resolution of the Fourth Meeting of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee on carrying out minority work, combined with the spirit of the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, the main tasks of ethnic work in the Central and Southern region in the coming year are:

    Based on the concentrated areas of ethnic minorities, implement the policy of regional autonomy. The specific arrangement is based on several different situations. It is planned to establish ethnic regional autonomy as soon as possible in areas where class differentiation is not obvious, ethnic relations are significant, or land reform has been completed, and to strengthen patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to gradually improve agricultural production technology on the existing basis to actively prepare for carrying out the movement to increase production. Some of the ethnic minority peoples who live on rocky mountains and cannot engage in agricultural production are planned to be helped to migrate in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    In areas where the social and economic structure is not much different from the Han areas, where there is a considerable foundation for work, or where the vast majority of land and mountains belong to the Han landlord class, and where the local people and the leaders who have contact with the people are urgently demanding land reform, the land or mountain problems will be solved along with the land reform movement in the whole province. However, it is necessary to establish regional autonomy after land reform or going down the mountain to distribute fields according to the specific local conditions in order to implement the policy of ethnic equality.

    For the Hui, Mongolian, Manchu, and other ethnicities scattered in cities and rural areas, ensure their rights of ethnic equality, support their production, and help them find employment or change careers. If they live in concentrated communities, the focus will be on promoting regional autonomy.

    In all tasks, attention should be paid to uniting the leading figures who have contact with the people, and special attention should be paid to and help should be given to the leading figures who have made contributions to the cause of people's liberation and firmly rely on the people. This work has been done poorly in some areas in the past, and efforts should be made to improve it in the future. With the help of the central government's financial and human resources, vigorously develop trade work in ethnic minority areas, and support or develop the production of ethnic minorities. In terms of cultural, educational, and health work, it is planned to run schools and hospitals, health centers, and prevention and treatment centers in counties and key areas, and to organize mobile medical teams to go to the countryside for treatment. Prevent and treat various infectious diseases. To do the above-mentioned tasks well, it is necessary to expand the publicity and influence of ethnic policies, break through ideological barriers, establish and improve ethnic affairs agencies at all levels as soon as possible, and promote and train a large number of ethnic cadres; and educate and encourage Han cadres in ethnic minority areas to work with peace of mind and make it a lifelong career. In order to enable cadres to work with peace of mind, it is necessary to appropriately take care of the lives of cadres working in ethnic minority areas.

    中南区民族工作的基本情况和今后工作意见
    ——在中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议上的发言摘要
    中南军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员　张执一
    一、民族情况
    中南区是历史上反动统治阶级统治较强的地区，民族压迫政策较之其他地区实施得更为彻底和残暴。因而，中南区约占人口总数百分之五的各少数民族，很早就被迫分散到偏僻山区，聚居区都很小。少数民族人民在残酷的压迫和恶劣的自然环境中仍能继续斗争、生存直到今天，充分地说明了他们是极为优秀的。
    民族压迫的内容之一是土地侵占和经济掠夺。杂居区各少数民族人民的土地，绝大部分被汉族地主巧取豪夺去了。聚居区的土地和经济，事实上也直接或间接地多为汉族地主所控制。再加上少数民族地区狭小，处在大块汉族地区之间，又受自然条件的限制，需要输出自己的土特产，换进粮、盐、布及其他生活必需品。因之，中南区各少数民族地区的经济密切地和汉族地区的经济联系着。
    历史上反动统治阶级，实施了“以夷制夷”和怀柔同化政策，有意地培养收买利用各少数民族中的少数败类作为工具，用以压迫剥削各少数民族的人民。并在各少数民族人民中间挑拨离间，制造纠纷和进行反动的宣传教育，来达到它统治的目的。因之，少数民族在文化上也不能正常发展，甚至停滞。但由于各民族的劳动人民间的长期接触，各民族劳动人民间的文化交流，并没有照反动统治阶级的意图而中止。
    国民党匪帮更有意地否认少数民族的存在。长期压迫歧视和强迫同化的结果，甚至有一部分少数民族人民不敢承认自己是少数民族。此外帝国主义的经济侵略和帝国主义者的教会侵略活动，也曾给了少数民族以政治、经济和文化上的毒害。
    为了反抗反动统治者的压迫，中南区汉族劳动人民和少数民族劳动人民，在革命中曾有不少的共同斗争的范例。从第一次国内革命战争起直到全国解放，广西左、右江瑶族和僮族及海南岛黎族、苗族的劳动人民便直接参加了革命战争。他们在共产党领导下战斗，出现了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹。
    这些事实，有力地说明了历史上反动统治阶级以及帝国主义、国民党匪帮等等是各族人民的公敌，各民族劳动人民的利益是一致的，不可分割的。
    中南区的少数民族，据初步了解，有苗、瑶、侗、僮、回、黎、蒙古、满、维吾尔、犹太、倮儸、畬、伶、倈、毛难、越南等十六个民族。其中属于僮族语系统的又有自称侬人、偏人、高橄人、沙人及僰人的。属于苗族系统的又有被称为仡佬、锹家的。属于瑶族语系统的又有自称山族的。如果连这些算上则有二十四个民族。这些民族中以苗、瑶、侗、僮、黎、回六个民族人口比较众多。僮族总数约有六百万人；苗族总数约四十八万人；侗族总数约二十五万人；瑶族总数共约四十六万人；黎族总数约三十万人。回族总数约三十五万人。全区少数民族总计约有八百到九百万人。
    解放前中南区各少数民族大部地区的封建剥削关系，采取了民族压迫的形式出现：汉族封建地主压迫少数民族农民，汉族商业高利贷者剥削少数民族土特产生产者；在某些地区又表现为少数民族中的僮族和侗族的地主阶级压迫苗、瑶族农民，黎族统治阶级压迫苗族的复杂形式。这就造成了各民族间的政治、经济、文化发展的不平衡。即在不同地区的同一个民族的政治、经济、文化情况也不相同。
    根据现有不完全的材料来看，僮族、侗族社会长期停留在农业经济基础上，产生了较大较多的地主。瑶、黎民族内部阶级分化比较不甚明显，绝大多数人都从事劳动，参加生产，多为汉民族封建地主阶级所直接压迫和剥削。黎族生产方法，至今使用木犁的还很多，铁器甚为罕见。生产技术和生产工具是相当落后的。苗族社会形态介于僮、侗二族和瑶、黎二族之间。过去湖南西部苗族中的反动地主阶级多和国民党匪帮勾结，且有世代为匪的。如湖南西部巨匪龙云飞等有“匪世家”之称，祸害苗族以及其他各民族人民甚深。回族多在城市及城镇附近地区，和汉族杂居，一般多从事小商业或手工业，少数从事农业，间有少数资本家和地主。其他各少数民族的社会，聚居的基本上同于苗族、瑶族或黎族，散居的同于汉族。
    在经济上，各少数民族一般缺少土地，生产力小。生产资料如农具、种籽、肥料等，生活资料如食粮、盐、布等，都非常缺乏。土特产遭受不等价交换，且不易售出，以致生活贫困，每年平均缺三至五个月的食粮。各少数民族地区的卫生状况甚为恶劣，疟疾为害很大，妇婴疾病多，死亡率也很大。
    各少数民族人民一般都具备着勤劳、勇敢、聪慧和忠诚的优秀品质。他们克服了“天水田”（在山上开的小块荒地，靠雨水耕种）、“挂牌土”（即斜陡七十五至八十度的山坡田）的自然环境，反抗了反动统治者，在抗美援朝运动中，表现了高度的爱国主义精神。
    以上是中南区少数民族政治、经济、文化、社会的概况。
    二、中南区二年多来的民族
      工作的成就和缺点
    中南军政委员会根据中央人民政府的民族政策，结合中南区各民族的实际情况，把加强各民族的团结，和安定各民族人民的生活做为中心工作之一。二年多来经过民族政策的宣传和实施，以及抗美援朝爱国主义运动的开展，各民族间开始建立了平等、友爱、团结、互助的关系。各民族人民衷心热爱毛主席，体会了祖国大家庭的温暖。
    中央人民政府和中南军政委员会曾先后派遣访问团到湘、桂、粤三省的少数民族地区，在各级人民政府协助和参加下，进行了宣传慰问等工作，进一步加强了民族团结。
    其次，敉平了在少数民族地区为祸最烈的蒋匪帮残余和历史性的匪患：并及时采取了减征或免征公粮的措施，拨出了大批粮食、衣服和贷款，结合组织生产，帮助各民族人民度过了灾荒；并使他们获得了空前未有的安定生活。据不完全统计，已发放的救济粮和贷粮约有一千余万斤，款达数百亿元。
    第三、各民族地区先后开过一至三次的各族各界人民代表会议，普遍地、乃至超过人口比例地吸收了各民族代表参加各种代表会议。一般的区乡政权都有少数民族干部参加；有的少数民族干部已当了正副区长、乡长、县长或副县长。贸易、文教等部门也吸收了不少的各民族干部。民族民主建政工作，在广西龙胜县、湖南通道县及广西大瑶山区等地都已完成；另有不少县、区、乡都正在进行民族民主政权建设的筹备工作。这些都为各民族的建设和发展创造了有利的条件。
    第四、在民族杂居区，各民族农民和汉族农民一道进行了反恶霸、减租退押、土地改革等运动，公平合理地分配了斗争果实和土地。解决了他们生产和生活上的主要困难，奠定了少数民族人民发展进步的基础。
    第五、在农林和贸易上，国营贸易公司曾努力在各民族地区，建立了不少的贸易机构，公平合理地调整了物价，并保持了物价的稳定。收购了大批土特产，供给了大批生活必需品，如盐、粮食、布匹等。
    第六、在文教卫生方面，各级人民政府文教卫生部门，在各民族地区，努力恢复旧小学和建立新小学，开办夜校、识字班和干部训练班，并在中学里设置少数民族学生公费名额。中南成立了民族学院，广东在南方大学内成立了民族班（正在筹设民族学院），湖南革命大学开办有民族干部班。少数民族入学，除免费外，并在录取标准、生活和学习方面给予适当照顾。卫生工作方面建立了卫生机构，并派出医疗队、防疫队到民族地区进行工作。部分地区进行了牲畜防疫和治疗的工作。中央访问团湘西访问团在各民族地区巡回医疗，办短期卫生训练班，并赠送给少数民族一部分药品。
    二年多来的经验教训证明，在少数民族地区还有不少的工作同志，不善于掌握民族政策，不善于结合当地民族当前发展阶段的特点和大多数人的要求进行工作。再加上各民族地区县以上的干部多自外来，他们过去很少甚至从来没有接触过少数民族，乡以下干部又多是新干部，因此在干部间很容易不自觉地发生大民族主义或狭隘民族主义的错误思想。例如，在民族民主建政问题上，有的同志认为要求实行区域自治是少数民族人民在“闹分裂”，“闹宗派”，“人民政府就是为人民的，就是各民族人民的，何必又什么自治不自治”！还有的认为“已经吸收了大批少数民族干部参加了政府工作，事实上已经自治了”。因此他们对推行区域自治和民族民主联合政府的方针，就采取不切实不认真的态度。
    在进行土地改革或社会改革工作中，有些地方硬性地搬用汉族地区的经验，强迫命令，不顾少数民族人民的觉悟程度，不依靠少数民族干部。如个别地方在进行下山分田工作中，不经过汉族农民和住在山上的少数民族农民间的充分协商，性急地分了田，结果少数民族农民在山下住了个把月，又迁回山上去了。宣传执行婚姻法，也有不顾客观情况强制执行的，引起了少数民族群众的不满。在培养和使用干部方面，有过分强调政治、文化水平和出身、成份的现象，把一些新提拔的民族干部安排在不适当的工作岗位上。
    大民族主义思想残余的另一表现，就是不信任少数民族人民，也不深入到少数民族群众中去，强调困难，怕惹麻烦，藉口言语不通，情况不熟，不宣传民族政策，把民族工作放在一边，消极等待，不闻不问。
    上面所述这些忽视民族特点，不注意民族关系，工作方法一般化的缺点，形成怕麻烦反而更麻烦，怕走弯路反而走了弯路，这都是忽视民族政策，缺乏群众观点的结果。
    由于长期的历史原因所造成的狭隘民族主义的偏向也应重视。如有人说：“区域自治了，我们这一民族单划一区，不要汉人”，“铜不沾铁，苗不沾客”，盲目的保守、排外的思想等等，同样地也妨害民族团结和本民族的进步、发展。
    就目前中南区情况说，上面这两种偏向，最主要和最普遍的是前一种，即大民族主义的残余影响。
    其次，中南区的民族工作，在许多具体工作上，还有着无计划、无步骤的混乱现象。如在少数民族地区压价抢购木材，使少数民族遭受不少损失，留下了不好的影响。
    这些缺点虽然是发展过程中难于避免的，但是我们必须正视和及时纠正。
    三、中南区今后民族工作的
      任务
    根据中南军政委员会第四次会议关于开展少数民族工作的决议，结合这次中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议的精神，提出在明年一年内，中南区的民族工作，主要任务是：
    以少数民族聚居区为基础，贯彻推行区域自治的方针。其具体布署，根据几种不同情况，拟在阶级分化不明显，民族关系显著或已完成土地改革的地区，早日建立民族的区域自治，并加强抗美援朝爱国主义教育，在现有基础上逐步提高农业生产技术，为开展增加生产运动作积极准备。其中有一部分居住石山上，无法进行农业生产的少数民族人民，拟有计划有步骤地帮助他们迁移。
    在社会经济结构和汉人地区相差无几，工作有相当基础，或土地、山林绝大部分属于汉民族地主阶级，以及当地人民及和人民有联系的领袖人物都在迫切要求土地改革的地区，则随着全省的土地改革运动解决土地或山林问题。但必须根据当地具体情况在土地改革或下山分田以后建立区域自治，以贯彻民族平等的政策。
    对散居在城市和农村的回族、蒙族、满族等，保障其民族平等的权利，扶助其生产，帮助其就业或转业。凡聚居的，则重点推行区域自治。
    在各项工作中都应该注意团结和人民有联系的领袖人物，尤应照顾和帮助曾对人民解放事业有过功绩，坚决靠拢人民的领袖人物。这项工作过去有些地区做得较差，今后当力谋改善。在中央的财力和人力的帮助下，大力展开少数民族地区的贸易工作，扶助或发展少数民族的生产。文教、卫生工作方面，拟办好县及重点区的学校和医院、卫生所、防治所，并组织巡回医疗队下乡治疗。防治流行性的各种疾病。要做好上列几项工作，必须扩大民族政策的宣传和影响，打通思想，早日建立和健全各级民族事务的机构，提拔和训练大批民族干部；并教育和鼓励在少数民族地区的汉族干部安心工作，做为终身事业。为了使干部安心工作，必须适当照顾少数民族地区工作干部的生活。
