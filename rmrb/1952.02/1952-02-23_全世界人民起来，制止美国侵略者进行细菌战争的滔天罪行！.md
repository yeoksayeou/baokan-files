    People of the World, Arise and Stop the American Aggressors' Heinous Crime of Germ Warfare!
    The utterly ruthless, blood-soaked American aggressors have recently committed another inhumane and heinous crime on the Korean battlefield! They have disregarded everything, openly and on a large scale using bacteriological weapons, directing them at the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, at our most beloved people who are known throughout the world, at all the people of Korea, carrying out a barbaric war of germs designed for extermination. All righteous people throughout the world, upon hearing yesterday's news from the Korean front exposing the American aggressors' cruel and murderous acts, will be filled with rage and will not tolerate the American murderers' monstrous crimes!
    The people of the world know that for a long time, on the front lines in Korea defended by the heroic Chinese and Korean people's forces, the American aggressors have been unable to make progress despite using the most intense artillery fire. Exhausted and at their wits' end, the American aggressors have thus disregarded the world's condemnation and used military aircraft to drop various vermin carrying infectious bacteria on the positions and rear areas of the Chinese and Korean troops. They attempt to use plague, cholera, and other malignant infectious diseases to destroy the lives of the Chinese and Korean people's heroes, to destroy the Korean people. They are attempting to use such extremely brutal methods to win what they cannot win by other means. This is an utterly insane struggle of inhumanity; this is a bloody crime that openly violates international law, following in the footsteps of the fascist germ warfare criminals of World War II.
    The American aggressors' violations of international law and bloody crimes committed in the Korean War are already too numerous to count. They have not only used weapons of mass destruction but have also used poison gas more than once. They have destroyed and continue to destroy countless Korean villages and cities, massacre countless peaceful Korean residents, and slaughter and abuse large numbers of captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean forces. However, the American aggressors are not satisfied with all these illegal and brutal atrocities; they are now more thoroughly violating international law by employing bacteriological weapons. This fully proves that the American aggressors' crimes are escalating day by day; and the crimes they are now committing with bacteriological weapons are even greater than all the crimes they have committed in the past. Because bacteriological weapons target the vast majority of humanity for large-scale destruction, the American aggressors who use these weapons cannot but be the mortal enemies of all peace-loving people, the mortal enemies of the justice and security of all mankind.
    All reliable materials prove that the inhumane American aggressors, determined to be enemies of the vast majority of humanity and to use bacteriological weapons, have been plotting for a long time. Since the end of World War II, the American war-mongers have been doing their utmost to protect the heinous Japanese germ warfare criminals, keeping this group of man-eating devils, and systematically researching and manufacturing bacteriological weapons. When the American aggression against Korea began to suffer disastrous defeats, Japanese germ warfare criminals were dispatched by the American aggressors to Korea to carry out on-the-ground preparations for germ warfare, and they used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. That is to say, before they massively used bacteriological weapons on the Korean battlefield, a large number of captured Chinese and Korean personnel had already been sacrificed to bacteriological weapons. The criminal activities on the US military's No. 1091 bacteriological landing craft have long been an open secret, providing the world's people with powerful evidence of the American aggressors' planned long-term preparation for germ warfare and long-term collusion with Japanese germ warfare criminals.
    The American aggressors' military adventure in Korea is doomed to failure because of the resolute and heavy, fatal blows constantly dealt by the heroes of the Chinese and Korean people's forces. In this situation, although the American aggressors are forced to conduct armistice negotiations, they are still unwilling to accept the defeat that lies before them and are desperately struggling to take risks. They have shamelessly searched for excuses and repeatedly and unreasonably obstructed and delayed the negotiations, preventing them from reaching the appropriate agreement in a timely manner. Before today, if people did not fully understand the real reason why the American aggressors were doing their best to delay the negotiations, then the facts now fully demonstrate that their purpose in delaying the negotiations is to prepare to use the most cruel means, namely a barbaric war of germs designed for extermination, in an attempt to salvage their hopeless situation of failure. They not only want to continue taking risky struggles on the Korean front, but also want to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea, destroying the entire Korea, in order to finally occupy the whole Korea as a military base for further provoking new wars.
    We cannot but issue a serious warning to the American aggressors: your heinous crime of inhumanely waging a war of germs is the most serious destruction and threat to human civilization and justice; you must bear full and ultimate responsibility for the consequences caused by this inhumane atrocity. Your repeated obstruction and delay of the Korean armistice negotiations are unreasonable and intolerable. While the Korean negotiations are still ongoing, you have viciously attacked the Korean army and people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, attempting to destroy them; this proves that you are extremely hateful of the world's people's ardent desire for peace and the interests of world peace, and you are increasingly becoming the common enemy of all mankind, and will forever isolate yourselves from mankind.
    Among the American aggressor forces, all those who have been deceived and still have a shred of humanity, whether they are Americans, British, French, Turks, Australians, or of other nationalities, when you see the American aggressors committing such a monstrous crime, you should also realize that this crime of destroying the vast majority of mankind is unforgivable, then you should also wake up, refuse to participate in and oppose this crime, and should not continue to blindly work for the American aggressors' criminal plan.
    We dare to assert that the American aggressors' entire plan of aggression is bound to fail completely, and all their risky struggles are futile. Since America's so-called naval and air force "superiority" and all other weapons of war have not been able to save it from failure in Korea, then it is certain that bacteriological weapons will also not be able to save it from failure. The American aggressors' monstrous crimes will only further arouse the righteous anger of the people of the world and the more heroic combat of the Chinese and Korean people's forces, and will not have any other result. The heroic Chinese and Korean soldiers will continue to give the aggressors heavy blows until they are willing to accept a fair and reasonable Korean armistice agreement.
    We call on all peace-loving people of the world to immediately mobilize urgently, for the sake of human civilization and justice, to resolutely stop the monstrous crime of large-scale germ warfare being carried out by the American aggressors in Korea. The people of the world have the right to demand that the United States withdraw its bloody hands that violate international law and poison humanity. We unanimously support the demand made by the Second Congress of the World Peace Council in its letter to the United Nations, representing the demands of hundreds of millions of people around the world: unconditionally prohibit all kinds of atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons, and other tools for large-scale destruction of humanity; declare the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal. We must hold the American aggressors fully responsible for all the crimes they have committed in Korea. If the American aggressors do not immediately stop their mad and brutal crimes, they must bear the bitter consequences of their crimes. All the people of China and the world should also more actively support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and resolutely and effectively use actions to shatter all the criminal plans of the American aggressors.

### 全世界人民起来，制止美国侵略者进行细菌战争的滔天罪行！

    全世界人民起来，制止美国侵略者进行细菌战争的滔天罪行！
    穷凶极恶、血债累累的美国侵略者，最近又在朝鲜战场制造着惨无人道的滔天罪行！他们竟然不顾一切地、公开地、大规模地使用了细菌武器，向着英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，向着世界闻名的我们最可爱的人，向着全朝鲜的人民，进行了灭绝人性的细菌战争。全世界正义的人类，只要听到昨天从朝鲜前线发来的揭露美国侵略者的这样残暴杀人的消息，都一定要发指眦裂，对于美国杀人犯的滔天罪行决不能加以容忍的！
    全世界人民都知道，很长时间以来，在英勇的中朝人民部队所守卫着的朝鲜前线的阵地上，美国侵略者用尽了一切最猛烈的炮火都不能有所进展。计穷力拙的美国侵略者于是就甘冒天下的大不韪，以军用飞机对准中朝部队的阵地和后方，大量撒布了传染细菌的各种毒虫。他们企图用鼠疫、霍乱和其他恶性的传染病来毁灭中朝人民英雄的生命，毁灭朝鲜人民。他们企图用这样极端残暴的方法，来赢得他们用其他方法所不能赢得的东西。这是毫无人性的绝顶疯狂的挣扎举动；这是继第二次世界大战中法西斯细菌战犯之后，公然破坏国际公法的血腥罪恶。
    美国侵略者破坏国际公法，在朝鲜战争中所造下的血腥罪恶，早已屈指难数了。他们曾不仅使用过大规模毁灭性的武器，并且不止一次地使用过毒气。他们曾经并正继续毁灭朝鲜的无数村庄和城市，屠杀朝鲜无数和平的居民，大批屠杀和虐待中朝部队被俘的人员。但是，美国侵略者还不满足于这一切非法残暴的兽行，他们现在更彻底地破坏了国际公法而采用了细菌武器。这完全证明美国侵略者的罪恶是一天天变本加厉的；而他们现在使用细菌武器所造成的罪恶，则比他们过去所犯的一切罪恶更为重大。由于细菌武器是以广大人类作为它大规模毁灭的对象的，因此使用这种武器的美国侵略者就不能不是一切爱好和平人民的死敌，不能不是全人类正义和安全的死敌。
    一切可靠的材料证明，灭绝人性的美国侵略者，决心与广大人类为敌、使用细菌武器是蓄谋已久的。自第二次世界大战结束以来，美国的战争贩子们就曾极力庇护恶贯满盈的日本细菌战犯，豢养着这一批吃人的魔鬼，有计划地研究和制造细菌武器。在美国侵朝战争开始遭受惨败的时候，日本细菌战犯就被美国侵略者派遣到朝鲜，实地进行细菌战争的准备工作，并曾以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员作为细菌武器的实验品。这就是说，当他们在朝鲜战场上大量使用细菌武器以前，就已经有大批中朝被俘人员做了细菌武器的牺牲了。侵朝美军的第一○九一号细菌登陆艇上的罪恶勾当，早已成为公开的秘密，它向全世界人民提供了美国侵略者有计划地长期准备细菌战争并与日本细菌战犯长期合谋的有力罪证。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜的军事冒险，因遭遇中朝人民部队的英雄们所不断给予的坚决而沉重的致命打击，已注定了失败的命运。在这种情况下，美国侵略者虽然被迫进行着停战谈判，但他们对于摆在自己眼前的失败的战局，仍然不肯甘心，仍然极力作冒险的挣扎。他们曾百般无耻地寻找藉口，屡次蛮横无理地阻挠和拖延谈判，使谈判不能及时获得应有的协议。在今天以前，如果说人们还不完全明瞭美国侵略者为什么要极力拖延谈判的真正原因的话，那末，现在的事实就完全说明了他们拖延谈判的目的，就是为了准备采用最残酷的手段，即以灭绝人性的细菌战争，来企图挽救他们再也无法挽救了的失败局势。他们不但想在朝鲜前线上继续冒险挣扎，并且还想延长和扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，毁灭整个朝鲜，以便于最后占领全朝鲜作为进一步挑拨新战争的军事基地。
    我们不能不向美国侵略者提出严重的警告：你们灭绝人性地进行细菌战争的滔天罪行，是对于人类的文明和正义的最严重的破坏和威胁；你们必须对于这种惨无人道的暴行所引起的后果，担负全部的和最后的责任。你们对于朝鲜停战谈判，一再加以阻挠和拖延是毫无理由的，是不能容忍的。你们在朝鲜谈判还在继续举行的时候，竟对朝鲜的军队及人民和中国人民志愿军下了凶狠的毒手，企图毁灭他们；这证明你们对于世界人民热烈要求和平的愿望及世界和平的利益是极端仇恨的，你们正日益成为全人类的公敌，将永远自绝于人类。
    在美国侵略军中，所有被欺骗的还有一点人心的人们，无论是美国人、英国人、法国人、土耳其人、澳洲人，或是其他国籍的人，当你们看到美国侵略者犯了这样的弥天大罪之后，你们也应该认识到这种毁灭广大人类的罪恶是不可饶恕的吧，那末，你们也就应该觉悟起来，拒绝参加和反对这种罪行，而不应该继续盲目地为美国侵略者的罪恶计划卖命。
    我们敢于断定美国侵略者的全部侵略计划是一定要彻底失败的，他们的一切冒险挣扎都是徒劳的。美国的所谓海空军“优势”和其他一切战争武器，既然都没有能够挽救它在朝鲜的失败，那末，细菌武器同样也挽救不了它的失败，这也是可以确定的。美国侵略者的滔天罪行，只有更加激起全世界人民的正义的愤怒和中朝人民部队更英勇的作战，决不会有别的任何结果。英勇的中朝战士必将继续予侵略者以沉重的打击，直到他们愿意接受一个公平合理的朝鲜停战协定为止。
    我们号召全世界爱好和平的人民，立即紧张地动员起来，为了人类的文明和正义，坚决制止美国侵略者在朝鲜所进行的大规模细菌战争的滔天罪行。全世界人民都有权要求美国收回它破坏国际公法、毒杀人类的血腥魔手。我们一致拥护世界和平理事会第二届大会致联合国书中所提出的、代表全世界亿万人民的要求：无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。我们一定要美国侵略者对于他们在朝鲜所造下的一切罪恶负完全的责任。如果美国侵略者不立即停止疯狂残暴的罪行，他们就必须自食其罪行的恶果。我们全中国和全世界人民还应当更加积极地支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，坚决有效的用行动来粉碎美国侵略者的一切罪恶计划。
