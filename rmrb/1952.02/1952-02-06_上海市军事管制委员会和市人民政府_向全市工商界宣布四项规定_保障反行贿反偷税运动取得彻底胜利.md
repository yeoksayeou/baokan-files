Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 5th: The movements against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence, have been enthusiastically launched in Shanghai. The Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government recently announced four regulations to ensure the complete victory of this movement, requiring all industrial and commercial circles in the city to abide by them. The four regulations are:

    1.  During the movement, managers, deputy managers, and other responsible persons of all private shops and enterprises are not allowed to take leave from their enterprises (except those who have thoroughly confessed and guaranteed that there are no other illegal activities).

    2.  No industry is allowed to close down, dismiss employees, fail to pay or reduce wages and year-end bonuses, stop providing meals, threaten, beat, or bribe shop assistants, clerks, workers, or internal bribery personnel of state organs, or enter into any treaties or agreements such as "alliances of defense" with these personnel. Without the consent of the labor union, shop assistants, clerks, and workers shall not be transferred from the enterprise or to other places.

    3.  Any private announcement of closure or disguised closure, dismissal or disguised dismissal during the movement is illegal and invalid and must be immediately resumed. All expenses paid, such as travel expenses, wages, severance pay, and resettlement fees, shall not be recovered. Wages shall be paid as usual after shop assistants, clerks, and workers resume work, and shall not be deducted on any pretext or in any disguised form.

    4.  In order to guarantee the patriotic reporting movement of shop assistants, clerks, and workers and to give full play to their initiative, it is specifically stipulated that:

        A. During the movement, no one shall obstruct or threaten shop assistants, clerks, and workers from attending meetings convened by the labor union by means such as deducting wages.

        B. In view of the fact that some illegal capitalists in the past often used petty favors to shop assistants, clerks, and workers (such as "profit sharing," "equity participation," "extra allowances," "more dividends," etc.) in order to facilitate their bribery, profiteering, theft, and tax evasion, or used shop assistants, clerks, and workers to carry out illegal actions, therefore, as long as shop assistants, clerks, and workers actively report the illegal activities of illegal capitalists, the government guarantees that these benefits already belonging to the shop assistants, clerks, and workers will remain their own, and no investigation or punishment will be made.

    上海市军事管制委员会和市人民政府
    向全市工商界宣布四项规定
    保障反行贿反偷税运动取得彻底胜利
    【新华社上海五日电】反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动和反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的运动，已在上海市热烈展开。中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会和上海市人民政府为了保障这一运动取得彻底胜利，在最近宣布了四项规定，要求全市工商界一体遵行。四项规定是：一、在运动期内，各私营商店、企业的经理、副经理以及其他负主要责任者，一律不准请假离开本企业（但如已彻底坦白，并具结保证再无其他非法行为者例外）。二、任何行业，在运动期内不准歇业，不准解雇，不准不发或少发工资与年奖，不准不开伙食，不准威胁、打骂、利诱店员、职员、工人与国家机关内部的受贿人员，不准与这些人员订立什么如“攻守同盟”等等的条约或协议，非经工会同意不得将店员、职员、工人调离本企业或调到外埠。三、凡在运动期内已私自宣布歇业或变相歇业、解雇或变相解雇者，都是非法的，一律无效，必须立即复业与复工。凡已付出的路费、工资、解雇金、遣散费等，一律不得收回。店员、职员、工人复工后工资照给，不得借故或变相扣除。四、为保证店员、职员、工人们的爱国检举运动，并充分发挥他们的积极性，特规定：甲、在运动期内，任何人不得阻挠和用扣工资等办法来威胁店员、职员、工人参加工会所召开的会议；乙、鉴于过去某些不法资本家为了便于达到自己行贿、暴利、盗窃、偷漏等目的，常以小恩小惠施之于店员、职员、工人（如“分肥”、“入股份”、“额外津贴”、“多分红利”等），或曾利用店员、职员、工人之手去进行非法行动，因此只要店员、职员、工人们积极检举不法资本家的非法行为，政府保证这些已归店员、职员、工人的利益，一律仍归自己所有，也不作任何追究与处分。
