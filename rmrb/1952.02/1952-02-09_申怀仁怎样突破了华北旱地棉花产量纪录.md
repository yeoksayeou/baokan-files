    Shen Huairen of Houchun Village, Zhaocheng County, Shanxi Province, planted a total of 7.1 mu of cotton in 1951, and the yield was higher than in 1950; especially the 2.3 mu of high-yield land that had been sand-covered and cultivated, the yield was even more outstanding, with an average yield of more than 577 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than three times the average yield of cotton per mu in the whole village, breaking the highest record of 470 jin of seed cotton per mu in North China dryland cotton in 1950. The main reasons why his dryland cotton was able to harvest more than others are: First, he skillfully planted seeds after covering the land with sand and cultivating it, ensuring full emergence of seedlings and overcoming drought; Second, after eliminating insect pests, he carried out meticulous management of the cotton fields, promoting early maturity of the cotton and making up for the losses caused by insect pests.
    Shen Huairen's cotton fields are all terraced fields, which are often threatened by drought. In the autumn tillage of 1950, his 2.3 mu of high-yield land was plowed once and harrowed twice. In the spring of 1951, he first used a drill to sow 100 jin of dried bean cake per mu into the soil as base fertilizer, and then plowed twice and harrowed five times; local farmers have the habit of covering the land with sand to prevent drought, conserve moisture, and keep it warm, after plowing and harrowing, he spread a layer of three-finger-thick river sand on these 2.3 mu of land. Before sowing, his seeds were treated by methods such as seed selection, soaking, and mixing with grass and wood ash. At that time, because the weather was dry and the land was dry, he implemented water-carrying spot planting: he first used a shovel to dig a hole one finger deep in the dry sand to hold water, and then poured a bowl of water into each hole, after the water seeped down, he then opened the wet sand to expose the soil surface, and inserted the shovel obliquely into the soil to open an oblique ditch about two fingers deep, and scattered more than ten seeds into it. After sowing, he buried the soil, covered it with a layer of wet sand, and then covered the wet sand with a layer of dry sand, and then smoothed it with a shovel, and picked up the stones on the hole, so that it could not only maintain moisture, but also easily emerge seedlings. Six days after he sowed, all the cotton seedlings emerged. As the saying goes, "Seeing the seedlings is three points of harvest." Sand covering to conserve moisture and keep it warm, ensuring full emergence of seedlings, is one of the conditions for him to increase the yield of dryland cotton.
    In addition to implementing sand covering to conserve moisture and keep it warm, overcoming drought, and ensuring full emergence of seedlings, Shen Huairen also has many advantages in planting techniques. After the cotton seedlings had just emerged, he hoeed three times with a small hoe. When the cotton seedlings grew two to three true leaves, he removed the weak seedlings, leaving only two to three strong cotton seedlings per hole (not thinning seedlings all at once), which could not only prevent the cotton seedlings from being crowded, but also prevent accidental disasters and the risk of missing seedlings. In mid-June, aphids occurred in the cotton field, although he used cotton oil soap to control them twice, the fruit branches in the lower part of the cotton plants were still severely damaged. After pest control, in order to make the newly grown buds develop rapidly, he removed all the severely damaged fruit branches under the cotton plants. However, this caused the cotton plants to form a top-heavy phenomenon, and later suffered a wind disaster, causing many cotton plants to be blown down by the strong wind, he patiently helped the cotton plants up one by one, and did this continuously for three times, and finally ensured the normal development of the cotton seedlings. Later, when the cotton bolls formed, in order to promote the early maturity of the cotton bolls, he removed some fruit branches that could not mature according to the growth of the cotton branches, and picked off some cotton bolls that could not mature, so that the strong growing fruit branches and cotton bolls could get a full supply of nutrients and grow rapidly. Although his cotton plants grew very unevenly and the number of bolls was also very inconsistent, the cotton bolls grew neatly and evenly, and matured early. Local farmers generally only received 30% to 40% of white cotton before the frost period, while he received more than 60% before the frost period. He carried out meticulous management of the cotton fields, making up for the losses caused by insect pests, so his cotton finally achieved early maturity and high yield.

    申怀仁怎样突破了华北旱地棉花产量纪录
    山西省赵城县候村申怀仁一九五一年共种七亩一分棉花，产量都比一九五零年高；特别是经过铺砂整地的二亩三分丰产地，产量更突出，平均每亩产籽棉五百七十七斤多，超过全村棉花每亩平均产量三倍多，突破了一九五零年华北旱地棉花每亩产籽棉四百七十斤的最高纪录。他的旱地棉花所以能够比别人收的多，主要原因是：一、他铺砂整地巧下种，保证了全苗，战胜了干旱；二、他在消灭虫害后，对棉田实行精细管理，促成棉花早熟，弥补了因虫害所受的损失。
    申怀仁的棉地都是梯田，经常遭受干旱威胁。在一九五零年秋耕时，他的二亩三分丰产地犁过一遍，耙过两遍。一九五一年春天，他先在每亩地里用耧耩到土里一百斤干豆饼作基肥，又犁两遍耙五遍；当地农民有铺砂防旱保墒保温的习惯，犁耙以后，他就在这二亩地上铺盖了一层三指厚的河砂。播种前，他的种籽都经过粒选、浸泡和用草木灰搅拌等方法处理。当时因天旱地干，他就实行挑水点种：他先用铲把干砂拨开一指深为容水穴，然后在每一个穴里倒一碗水，水渗下后再拨开湿砂露出土面，把铲斜插到土中开成约二指深的一条斜沟，撒进十多粒种籽。撒种后就把土埋好，盖一层湿砂，在湿砂上又蒙上一层干砂，然后用铲抹平，并捡去穴上的石子，这样不但可以保持水分，而且容易出苗。他播种后六天，棉苗就全部出齐。俗话说：“见苗三分收”。铺砂保墒，保证全苗，是他提高旱地棉花产量的条件之一。
    申怀仁除了实行铺砂保墒保温，战胜干旱，保证全苗外，在植棉技术方面也有许多优点。棉苗刚出齐以后，他用小锄锄了三遍。到棉苗长出两个到三个真叶时，他就拔去弱苗，每穴只留粗壮棉苗两株到三株不等（不一次定苗），这样既可防止棉苗拥挤，又可防止意外灾害和缺苗的危险。六月中旬，棉田发生了蚜虫，他虽用棉油皂除治了两次，但棉株下部的果枝仍受到了严重的创伤。治虫后，为使新生的幼芽迅速发育，他把棉株下面受重伤的果枝全部除去。但这样棉株形成了上大下小的现象，后来又遭受风灾，使许多棉株被大风吹倒，他耐心地一一把棉株扶起，这样连续做了三遍，终于保证了棉苗的正常发育。后来棉花结桃时，为了促使棉桃早熟，他按照棉枝生长情形，除去一些不可能发育成熟的果枝，摘掉一些不可能成熟的棉桃，使生长强壮的果枝和棉桃，得到充分的养分供应，迅速成长。他的棉株虽然长得很不整齐，结桃的数量也很不一致，但是棉桃却长得整齐均匀，成熟期早。当地一般农民在霜期前只收到百分之三十到四十的白花，他在霜期以前却收到了百分之六十以上。他对棉田实行精细管理，弥补了因虫害所受的损失，因此，他的棉花终于得到早熟和丰产。
