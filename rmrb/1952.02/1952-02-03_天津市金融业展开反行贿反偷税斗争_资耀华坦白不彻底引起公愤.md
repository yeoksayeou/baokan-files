Tianjin Financial Industry Launches Anti-Bribery, Anti-Tax Evasion Struggle
Zi Yaohua's Incomplete Confession Arouses Public Indignation

[Report from this newspaper] In the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, Zi Yaohua, the manager of the Shanghai Bank in Tianjin, adopted an extremely dishonest attitude towards his various illegal activities, procrastinating and waiting for a long time, attempting to escape this great movement of political and ideological transformation. This aroused deep dissatisfaction among the employees of the Shanghai Bank in Tianjin and the financial community. Under repeated urging from the masses, Zi Yaohua finally made a preliminary confession at the general membership meeting of the financial industry on January 31, admitting to three illegal facts: not reporting off-the-books accounts, reselling gold, and privately destroying off-the-books accounts. However, his confession was very incomplete, limited only to the facts that had already been exposed and for which there was conclusive evidence. Therefore, the participants unanimously demanded that Zi Yaohua reflect further and thoroughly confess all illegal facts.

Not long before the liberation of Tianjin, the Shanghai Bank had off-the-books accounts. The materials in these accounts included 93 taels of gold, 1,083,000 shares of East Asia stock, 1,260,000 shares of Jiangnan stock, 50,000 shares of Zhongyuan Company stock, 200 pounds of East Asia yarn, 30 yards of East Asia wool, and 30 bolts of white cloth. After the liberation of Tianjin, under the instructions of Zi Yaohua, the Shanghai Bank never reported this to the Military Control Commission's Financial Department, in accordance with government financial regulations. Zi Yaohua also ordered Chen Jitang, the deputy manager of the Shanghai Bank, to peddle 18 taels of gold on the black market in mid-February 1949. In order to eliminate evidence of his illegal activities, Zi Yaohua divided the materials in the off-the-books accounts equally in May of the same year and then privately burned the off-the-books accounts (the person in charge of the accounts only burned part of them, fearing that the government would investigate). However, in January 1951, Zi Yaohua's illegal activities were reported, and the off-the-books accounts of the Shanghai Bank were discovered by the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Financial Department. At that time, Zi Yaohua was not in Tianjin, so the Financial Department summoned Deputy Manager Chen Jitang and Assistant Manager Qin Guansheng. After repeated enlightenment and education from the cadres of the Financial Department, Chen and Qin reported the concealment of off-the-books accounts and other situations. After Zi Yaohua returned to Tianjin, he not only did not repent to the government, but also coerced Chen and Qin into going to the Financial Department to retract their confessions, asking them to take the responsibility upon themselves and not to say that these illegal activities were instigated by Zi Yaohua. Zi Yaohua also told Chen and Qin: If the court detains you, I can bail you out.

On January 15 this year, various banks in Tianjin held a confession and accusation meeting. Chen Jitang tearfully exposed Zi Yaohua's illegal activities and his conspiracy to shift the blame to others, and demanded that Zi Yaohua confess on the spot. However, Zi Yaohua shirked responsibility, saying that he knew nothing about not reporting off-the-books accounts, reselling gold, or destroying off-the-books accounts, and even denied that these illegal activities were instigated by him. The participants were very dissatisfied and exposed many of Zi Yaohua's illegal facts verbally or in writing, and proposed that Zi Yaohua should reflect further. On January 17, the financial industry held its second confession and accusation meeting. Everyone originally hoped that Zi Yaohua could make a public self-criticism at this meeting, but before the meeting, Zi Yaohua arrogantly said to the person who invited him to the meeting: I don't have time today, the meeting of the Democratic National Construction Association must be presided over by me. In fact, the meeting held by the Tianjin branch of the Democratic National Construction Association that day was not presided over by him; he merely took a stroll to the Tianjin branch of the Democratic National Construction Association and then left. The masses were even more resentful of Zi Yaohua's refusal to confess and continued to expose his crimes, and demanded that Zi Yaohua confess within a time limit. Driven by the masses, coupled with repeated education from relevant parties, he finally made a preliminary confession at the financial industry conference held on January 31, admitting that he had instructed the non-reporting of off-the-books accounts, reselling of gold, and destruction of off-the-books accounts, and three other illegal facts.

After listening to Zi Yaohua's confession, the masses at the meeting believed that Zi Yaohua's "confession" was limited only to the facts that had been exposed and for which there was conclusive evidence, while he still did not confess to other illegal facts. Everyone expressed deep dissatisfaction with his dishonest attitude.

At the meeting, all the managers, deputy managers, and assistant managers of eight banks in Tianjin, including Xinhua, China Industrial, China General Commerce, Jianye, Zhejiang Xingye, Guohua, Hecheng, and Juxingcheng, presented their written opinions on the spot, pointing out that Zi Yaohua's explanation of the issues was extremely incomplete and his attitude was very dishonest. In order to do a good job in the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement in the financial industry, they believed that Zi Yaohua's "fortress" must be breached, and they exposed five illegal facts about Zi Yaohua on the spot, and at the same time raised the issue of Zi Yaohua's past collusion with Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits, demanding that Zi Yaohua confess thoroughly. Lu Dulun, chairman of the Shanghai Bank Trade Union, and Zeng Hengsan, manager of the Tianjin Taiping Insurance Company, also exposed Zi Yaohua's other crimes at the meeting, hoping that he would confess quickly and bow his head to the people.

At the same time, Sun Jimin, director of the Joint Management Committee of Public-Private Joint Venture Banks in Tianjin (the Shanghai Bank was reorganized into a public-private joint venture in November of last year), announced that Zi Yaohua's position as a member of the Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Bank Joint Management Committee was temporarily revoked. He also announced the establishment of a special team to investigate Zi Yaohua's illegal activities.

    天津市金融业展开反行贿反偷税斗争  
    资耀华坦白不彻底引起公愤
    【本报讯】天津市上海银行经理资耀华在反行贿、反偷税运动中，对自己的种种违法行为采取极不老实的态度，长期拖延观望，企图逃避这一政治改造与思想改造的伟大运动，因而引起天津市上海银行职工及金融界的深刻不满。在群众的再三督促下，资耀华才在一月三十一日金融业所召开的全体会员大会上，初步坦白了自己不报后帐、倒卖黄金和私自烧毁后帐等三项违法事实。但他的坦白很不彻底，所坦白的只限于已经被检举且证据确凿的事实。因此，与会人员一致要求资耀华再作反省，彻底坦白交代一切违法事实。
    在天津市解放前不久，上海银行设有后帐。后帐物资有黄金九十三两、东亚股票一百零八万三千股、江南股票一百二十六万股、中原公司股票五万股、东亚毛线二百磅、东亚呢三十码、白布三十匹等。天津市解放后，在资耀华的指使下，上海银行始终没有按照政府的金融法令，向军管会金融处呈报。资耀华并命令上海银行副理陈际唐在一九四九年二月中旬，在黑市兜售黄金十八两。资耀华为了消灭违法罪证，在同年五月把后帐物资平分后，竟私自烧毁后帐（后帐经管人怕政府查出，只把后帐烧了一部分）。可是在一九五一年一月，资耀华的违法行为被人告发，上海银行后帐便被天津市军管会金融处查觉。当时资耀华不在天津，金融处遂传讯了副理陈际唐、襄理秦冠生二人。经过金融处干部再三的启发、教育，陈、秦两人呈报了隐匿后帐等情况。资耀华回到天津后，不仅没有向政府悔过自新，反而胁迫陈、秦两人到金融处去推翻口供，要他们把责任拉到自己身上，不要说这些违法行为是资耀华所主使的。资耀华并告诉陈、秦两人说：如果法院把你们扣起来，我可以保你们出来。
    今年一月十五日，天津市各银行召开坦白检举大会。陈际唐当场痛哭流涕地揭发了资耀华的违法事实和企图诿罪于人的阴谋，并要求资耀华当场坦白。可是资耀华推卸责任，说自己对不报后帐、倒卖黄金、烧毁后帐等事全不知道，更不承认这些违法行为是他所指使的。参加会的人都十分不满，纷纷用口头或书面揭发了资耀华的许多违法事实，并提出资耀华应当再作反省。一月十七日金融业举行第二次坦白检举大会，大家原来希望资耀华能在这个会上作公开检讨，可是在开会前资耀华竟傲慢地对邀他参加会的人说：我今天没有功夫，民主建国会的会非我主持不可。事实上，民主建国会天津分会当天所举行的会议，并不是他主持的，他仅仅到民主建国会天津分会去蹓了一趟就走了。群众对资耀华这种拒不坦白的行动，更加愤恨，除继续检举他的罪行外，并要资耀华限期坦白。在群众推动下，加上有关方面对他的反复教育，他才在一月三十一日举行的金融业大会上作了初步坦白，承认了自己指使不报后帐、倒卖黄金、烧毁后帐等三项违法事实。
    到会群众听了资耀华的坦白以后，认为资耀华所“坦白”的只限于被检举出来的证据确凿的事实，而对于其他的违法事实，仍不交代。大家对他的不老实的态度深表不满。
    会上，天津市新华、中国实业、中国通商、建业、浙江兴业、国华、和成、聚兴诚等八个银行全体经理、副理、襄理，当场提出了他们的书面意见，指出资耀华交代问题极不彻底，态度很不老实。为了在金融业内搞好反行贿、反偷税运动，他们认为资耀华这个“堡垒”必须加以攻破，并当场检举了关于资耀华的五项违法事实，同时提出资耀华过去和日寇以及国民党匪帮相勾结的罪行，要资耀华彻底坦白。上海银行工会主席鹿笃伦和天津市太平保险公司经理曾衡三也在会上检举了资耀华的其他罪行，希望他迅速坦白，向人民低头。
    同时，天津市公私合营银行（上海银行在去年十一月改组为公私合营）联合管理委员会主任委员孙及民宣布：暂时撤销资耀华所任的天津市公私合营银行联合管理委员会委员的职务。并宣布成立专门小组，对资耀华的违法行为进行调查。
