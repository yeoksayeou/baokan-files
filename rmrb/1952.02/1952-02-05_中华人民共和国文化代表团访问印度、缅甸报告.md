    Report on the Visit of the Chinese People's Republic Cultural Delegation to India and Burma

    I

    The Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China was dispatched by the Central People's Government at the invitation of the governments of India and Burma. The delegation consisted of fifteen professors and experts from the fields of science, philosophy, economics, history, literature, linguistics, fine arts, film, and music. The mission of the cultural delegation was to enhance cultural relations and friendship between China and India and Burma. We left Beijing on September 20, 1951, and arrived in New Delhi, the capital of India, on October 29. The visit schedule began on that day. We were in India for a total of 41 days until we left Calcutta on December 8. During these 41 days, we traveled north to South Kanara, south to Cape Comorin, east to Calcutta, and west to Bombay, and visited Hyderabad in the Deccan Plateau. In terms of historical sites and scenic spots, we visited the Mughal dynasty's Red Fort and Taj Mahal, the stupa built by Emperor Ashoka in Sanchi in the 3rd century BC, the ancient sculptures of Elephanta Island, Ellora, and Mahabalipuram, the ancient murals of Ajanta, and the ancient Buddhist sites of Sarnath, Nalanda, and Rajgir. In terms of cultural and academic institutions, we visited Delhi University, the Malaria Institute, the Road Research Institute, the National Physical Laboratory, the National Museum, and the Central Agricultural Research Institute in Delhi; Aligarh University, Roorkee University, and the Building Research Institute; the irrigation project in South Kanara; the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the Haffkine Institute, and the Bombay Museum in Bombay; Osmania University in Hyderabad; the Mysore Government Silk Filature, the Shimoga Sugar Factory, the Raman Research Institute, and the Indian Institute of Science; Madras University and the Madras Museum in Madras; Patna University; the Calcutta Museum in Calcutta, as well as the nearby Tata Steel Plant and Santiniketan's Visva-Bharati University. We also had the opportunity to listen to Indian music, watch Indian dances, dramas, films, art exhibitions, and handicraft displays in various places. We also had the opportunity to talk or hold discussions with professors from various universities, experts from cultural and academic institutions, as well as musicians, writers, painters, dancers, and social workers to exchange ideas.

    After the visit to India, the delegation left Calcutta on December 9 and arrived in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, on the same day. The visit schedule to Burma began on the 10th and lasted for 18 days until December 27. In Burma, we visited the religious building of Shwedagon Pagoda and other pagodas, the scenic spot of Gokteik Viaduct, and the only remaining wooden building of the former palace. We visited Mandalay in Upper Burma, Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State, toured Inle Lake, visited the floating island villages, visited Myaungmya in the delta, and cruised the Irrawaddy River. In Rangoon, we visited Rangoon University and talked with professors; in Mandalay, we also visited Mandalay College and the Agricultural Science Department of Rangoon University, and visited experimental farms for improved rice varieties. In Burma, we repeatedly saw performances of films, dramas, music, dance, and puppet shows; these art programs also left us with a deep impression.

    Whether in India or Burma, wherever we went, the people of India and Burma expressed a warm welcome to us, and local authorities and people's organizations held grand mass welcome rallies. In addition, we also received many valuable gifts and enthusiastic letters and telegrams.

    II

    During the visit to India and Burma, the delegation held five Chinese cultural and art exhibitions in important cities of India and Burma. There were eight days of exhibition in New Delhi, India, six days in Bombay, five days in Calcutta, six days in Rangoon, Burma, and four days in Mandalay. The exhibition included more than 350 pictures about modern China, 435 replicas of Dunhuang murals, and more than 290 pieces of ancient and modern handicrafts. The total number of visitors in the five places was 215,000. In the opinion book, some viewers requested an extension of the exhibition, some said they had never seen such a great exhibition, and some said that seeing this exhibition was enough to increase the friendship between China and India and China and Burma. An Indian said: "In this exhibition, we saw the achievements of the Chinese people in the past three years. Their enthusiasm, perseverance and work should be emulated by oppressed people all over the world. All freedom-loving and peace-loving people in the world are happy from the bottom of their hearts to see China's strength and heroism. Long live the great leader Mao Zedong! Long live China!" A Burmese person said: "We, the sons and daughters of Burma, are willing to join hands with the sons and daughters of New China and embark on the road to happiness and light." Among the exhibits, the replicas of the Dunhuang murals, embroidery, brocade, porcelain, and ivory carvings were very popular. The exhibition was crowded with visitors every day; in Calcutta, nearly 40,000 people poured into the venue to visit on the closing day.

    The films brought by the delegation were screened 11 times in India and 13 times in Burma. The number of people who watched the films was approximately 38,000. The films shown were: "The White-Haired Girl," "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," "Steel Soldiers," "Singing Triumphant Advance," and "Female Tractor Driver." Among them, "The White-Haired Girl" was shown the most times and was the most popular. Many people were moved to tears on the spot. "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" also made the audience excited and envious. The seriousness of the production and artistic achievements of our films have been recognized by audiences in India and Burma. Through watching the films, the audience has a particularly deep understanding of how the Chinese people gained liberation, how they united as one, and how they are building a new China.

    III

    Wherever we visited in India, except for a few places without overseas Chinese, there were overseas Chinese in varying numbers; thousands in some places, dozens in others. In Burma, there were overseas Chinese in every city and town visited by the delegation. The overseas Chinese we came into contact with in India and Burma fully demonstrated their love for the motherland and their warm welcome to the delegation. In Bombay, Hyderabad, Calcutta, Rangoon, and Mandalay, overseas Chinese held welcome rallies. In some places, even if there were very few overseas Chinese, or even if the delegation was only passing through, these few overseas Chinese would travel far to welcome us. The strength of New China has given overseas Chinese a glory they have never had before. At the overseas Chinese welcome rallies, the delegation described the great progress made in the motherland in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the past two years, which made them very excited.

    IV

    We express our gratitude to the President of the Republic of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the President of the Union of Burma, Dr. Sao Shwe Thaik, Prime Minister U Nu, and the administrative heads, responsible experts of cultural and academic institutions, and many people's organizations in the various places we visited, for their solemn and friendly reception and the warm welcome from the people of India and Burma!

    During the visit to India and Burma, our impressions of the cultures of the two countries are unforgettable.

    We have seen the magnificent creations of the Indian nation in history, culture, and art, and we admire the wisdom and hard work of the Indian people, which have left many glorious monuments in human history. At the same time, we also see the new achievements of many progressive scientists and artists in India today.

    Chairman Mao once said: "The Indian nation is a great nation, and the Indian people are a very good people." Our visit fully proves this truth. The land of India is vast and fertile, the population is large, the history is long, and the people are wise and hardworking. During our six weeks of visit, we deeply realized the Indian people's demand for peace and their desire for friendship with China.

    In Burma, we also saw the excellent achievements of this nation in culture and art. But at the same time, we also saw the wounds left by World War II on Burma, which is very worthy of our sympathy. A long section of the Rangoon wharf was destroyed; the auditorium of Rangoon University only has a roof shell, and its teaching equipment such as books and instruments have been completely lost; the old palace of Mandalay is only a ruin of broken tiles and walls; the large iron bridge across the Irrawaddy River in Mandalay has not yet been restored to its original state, and the houses in Mandalay city have suffered very heavy damage. These all prompted the Burmese people to strive for peace in Asia and the world, and to pursue the development of friendly relations between China and Burma.

    Our visit is only a beginning to strengthen the cultural and friendly relations between China and India and China and Burma. In this regard, we should do a lot of work in the future. For example, mutual contact in scientific research, mutual contact in the study of literature, philosophy, history, archeology, and language, mutual contact between Indian and Burmese universities and Chinese universities, mutual observation in fine arts, music, and drama, the exchange of books and newspapers, and the exchange of professors and students are all major responsibilities of cultural and academic circles in China, India, and Burma. The India-China Friendship Association and the Burma-China Friendship Association have done a lot of valuable work in developing the friendly relations between India and China and between China and Burma, and we will also make the same efforts.

    中华人民共和国文化代表团访问印度、缅甸报告
    一
    中华人民共和国文化代表团是中央人民政府应印度、缅甸两国政府的邀请而派遣的。代表团由科学、哲学、经济学、历史学、文学、语言学、美术、电影、音乐各部门的教授和专家十五人组成。文化代表团的任务，是增进中国与印度、缅甸间的文化关系和友谊。我们在一九五一年九月二十日离开北京，于十月二十九日到达印度首都新德里。访问日程，即于这一天开始。到十二月八日我们离开加尔各答为止，在印度共四十一天。在这四十一天里，我们北面到了南加尔，南面到了哥摩林角，东面到了加尔各答，西面到了孟买，德干高原则到了海得拉巴等地。在古迹名胜方面，我们参观了蒙兀儿王朝的建筑红堡与泰姬陵，纪元前三世纪阿育王在桑琪建的佛塔，象岛、埃罗拉和马哈巴里甫兰的古代雕刻，阿旃陀的古代壁画以及佛教的古代遗址鹿野苑、那烂陀、王舍城等处。在文化学术机构方面，我们参观了德里的德里大学，疟疾研究所，道路研究所，国立物理研究所，国立博物院，中央农业研究所，阿里加大学，洛棋大学，建筑研究所，南加尔的水利工程，孟买的塔塔基本科学研究所，海夫金的药物研究所，孟买博物院；海得拉巴的奥斯马尼亚大学，买索尔公营缫丝厂，西摩格糖厂，拉曼研究所，印度科学研究所，马德拉斯的马德拉斯大学与马德拉斯博物院，巴特那大学，加尔各答的加尔各答博物院以及附近的塔塔钢铁厂和桑特尼克坦的国际大学。我们还在各地听到了印度的音乐，看到了印度的舞蹈、戏剧、电影、美术展览会和手工艺品陈列所等。我们也曾经有机会和各大学的教授们，各文化学术机构的专家们以及音乐家、文学家、画家、舞蹈家，社会工作者们分别谈话或举行座谈，交换意见。
    印度访问完毕后，代表团于十二月九日离加尔各答。同日到达缅甸首都仰光。十日起，开始访问缅甸的日程。到十二月二十七日止，共在缅甸十八天。在缅甸，我们参观了宗教的建筑大金塔与其他佛塔，名胜风景区高乐，故宫仅存的木建筑。我们到过上缅甸的曼德勒，掸邦的首府东枝，游过燕尔湖，参观过水上浮岛的村庄，到过三角洲的毛吁箆，游过伊洛瓦底江。我们在仰光参观过仰光大学，和教授们谈过话；在曼德勒还参观了仰光大学的曼德勒学院和农科，参观过改良稻种的实验农场。在缅甸，我们多次地看到电影、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈和木偶戏的表演；这些艺术节目同样给我们留下深刻的印象。
    无论在印度，在缅甸，凡我们所经过的地方，印、缅人民都对我们表示热烈的欢迎，地方当局和人民团体曾举行盛大的群众欢迎会。此外，我们还收到了许多宝贵的礼物和热情的函电。二
    在访问印缅两国的期间，代表团曾在印缅两国的重要城市举行了中国文化艺术展览会五次。计在印度新德里展览八天，孟买展览六天，加尔各答展览五天，在缅甸仰光展览六天，曼德勒展览四天。展览内容包括关于现代中国的图片三百五十余幅，敦煌壁画摹本四百三十五幅，古代和现代手工艺品二百九十余件。参观的人数五处总计二十一万五千人。在意见簿上，有的观众要求展期，有的人说他从来没有看过这么伟大的展览会，有的人说看了这个展览会足以增加中印、中缅的友谊。一位印度人说：“在这个展览会里，我们看见中国人在三年之间的成就。他们的热心、毅力与工作是全世界受压迫的人们所应效法的。全世界爱好自由与和平的人们，看见中国的力量与英勇都从心里感到快乐。伟大的领袖毛泽东万岁！中国万岁！”一位缅甸人说：“我们缅甸的儿女们愿意和新中国的儿女们拉着手共同走上幸福光明的大路。”展览品中敦煌壁画的摹本、刺绣、织锦、瓷器和牙雕都十分受到欢迎。展览会每天都拥挤着观众；在加尔各答，闭幕的一天有近四万人拥入会场参观。
    代表团所带去的影片，在印度放映十一场，在缅甸放映十三场。看过电影的人数，约计三万八千多人。映出的影片为：“白毛女”、“中国民族大团结”、“钢铁战士”、“高歌猛进”、“女拖拉机手”。其中以“白毛女”放映的次数为最多，也最受欢迎。当场受感动而流泪的人很多。“中国民族大团结”也使观众兴奋、羡慕。我国影片制作的严肃性和艺术成就，已为印、缅两国观众所公认。观众通过看电影，特别深刻的认识了中国人民怎样获得解放，怎样团结一致，建设新的中国。
    三
    我们在印度访问过的地方，除了少数地方没有华侨外，都有人数不等的华侨；多者数千，少者数十。在缅甸，则凡是代表团访问的城市和村镇，都有华侨。我们在印、缅两国内所接触到的华侨充分表现出对祖国的热爱和对代表团的热烈欢迎。在孟买，在海得拉巴，在加尔各答，在仰光，在曼德勒，华侨都举行了欢迎会。有些地方，即或华侨人数甚少，甚至代表团仅属过境，这少数的华侨亦很远地跑来欢迎。新中国的强盛给了华侨以过去所不曾有过的光荣。代表团曾在华侨欢迎会上，叙述了祖国两年来政治、经济、文化各方面的伟大进步，使他们大感兴奋。
    四
    为了我们所受到的印、缅政府隆重而友好的招待和印、缅人民的热烈欢迎，我们对印度共和国总统普拉沙德博士、总理尼赫鲁先生、缅甸联邦总统萧恢塔博士、总理德钦努先生以及我们所访问的各地方的行政首长、文化学术机构的负责专家们和许多人民团体表示感谢！
    在印、缅访问过程中，我们对于印、缅两国文化的印象是难于磨灭的。
    我们看到了印度民族在历史文化、艺术上的弘伟的创造，我们钦佩印度人民的智慧和勤劳，这些智慧与勤劳在人类历史上留下许多光荣的纪念碑。同时我们也看到今天印度许多进步的科学家和艺术家们的新成就。
    毛主席曾说过：“印度民族是伟大的民族，印度人民是很好的人民。”我们访问的过程充分证明了这个真理。印度土地是广大而丰饶的，人口是众多的，历史是长久的，人民是智慧、勤劳的。在我们的六个星期的访问中，深切地认识到印度人民对和平的要求与对中国友好的愿望。
    在缅甸，我们同样看到了这一个民族在文化艺术上的优良的成果。但同时我们也看到第二次世界大战留给缅甸的创伤，这是十分值得我们同情的。仰光码头一大长段炸毁了；仰光大学礼堂只存在一个屋壳，其图书仪器等教学设备都损失殆尽；曼德勒的旧王宫只存下废瓦颓垣；曼德勒的横跨伊洛瓦底江的大铁桥还未恢复原状，曼德勒城的民房遭受到很惨重的破坏。这些都促使缅甸人民努力追求亚洲和世界的和平，追求中缅两国间友好关系的发展。
    我们的访问对加强中印、中缅之间的文化关系和友好关系只是一个开端。在这方面，今后我们还应当做很多工作。譬如科学研究上的互相联系，文学、哲学、历史、考古、语言等研究上的互相联系，印、缅的大学与中国的大学间的互相联系，美术、音乐、戏剧上的互相观摩，书籍、报刊的交换，教授与学生的交换，都是中、印、缅三国文化学术界人士的重大的责任。印中友好协会和缅中友好协会，在发展中印、中缅的友好关系上都已作了不少可贵的工作，我们也将作同样的努力。
