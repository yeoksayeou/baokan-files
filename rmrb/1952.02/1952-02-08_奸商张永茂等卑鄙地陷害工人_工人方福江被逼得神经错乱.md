    Despicable Merchants Zhang Yongmao and others Despicably Frame Workers
    Worker Fang Fujiang is Driven to Mental Collapse
    Comrade Editor: The unscrupulous merchants Zhang Yongmao and others of the private Deyi Wood Factory in Beijing used various despicable means to drive worker Fang Fujiang to a state of mental collapse. Fang Fujiang knew that the capitalists were engaging in cutting corners and using substandard materials. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, he was determined to report the capitalists' criminal behavior. Seeing that the situation was not good for them, the capitalists immediately tried to win him over, asking him to only talk about the small things and not the big ones. Fang Fujiang firmly refused. The next day, the unscrupulous merchants pressed him to reveal what materials he knew about, and even said, "If you tell me, the trade union won't know. If you have any problems, I will be fully responsible for your salary." Then, the unscrupulous merchants threatened him by saying, "I often deal with the People's Liberation Army." After all these methods failed, the unscrupulous merchants begged him. But Fang Fujiang was determined not to be tricked into saying a single word. On the evening of January 12th, the unscrupulous merchants instigated a group of henchmen to hold a so-called "comrade criticism meeting" to find out what he knew. At the meeting, as soon as he mentioned cutting corners, everyone refuted him and used other methods to isolate him. This went on all night, until he could no longer bear it. When he saw that all the records written by the accountant were completely wrong, he became furious and started to leave. The unscrupulous merchant held him back and incited those henchmen to surround him. One person begged him, another attacked him, driving Fang Fujiang to a state of mental collapse. We demand that the government immediately punish the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Yongmao who adopted such despicable means to sabotage the movement.
                                                                                                            Liu Yuhua

    奸商张永茂等卑鄙地陷害工人
    工人方福江被逼得神经错乱
    编辑同志：北京私营德义木厂奸商张永茂等使用各种无耻手段，竟把工人方福江逼得神经错乱了。方福江知道资方有偷工减料的行为。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，他就打定主意，要检举资方的犯罪行为。资方看见形势不对，就连忙拉拢他，要他只说小的，不谈大的。方福江坚决拒绝了。第二天，奸商逼问他知道那些材料，还说：“你跟我说，工会知道不了，你如有问题，你的工资我全部负责。”接着，奸商又用“我常和解放军来往”来威吓他。这些办法都失败后，奸商又向他央求。但方福江抱定决心，一句话也不被他套去。一月十二日晚上，奸商策动一群爪牙，召开所谓“同人检讨会”，要摸他的底。在会上，他一谈偷工减料，大家就驳斥他，并用其他方法孤立他。这样闹了一个通宵，闹得他不能支持。当他看到管账先生所写的纪录全部不对头的时候，他气急了，往外就走。奸商拉住他不放，并嗾使那些爪牙包围他，你
    一句央求，我一句打击，把方福江逼得神经错乱了。我们要求政府立即制裁采取这种卑鄙手段、破坏运动的奸商张永茂。  刘玉华
