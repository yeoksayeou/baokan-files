    Fu Guangqing Colludes with a Gang of Unscrupulous Merchants
    Signs Fake Contracts to Defraud Large Amounts of Money
    Anci County People's Court Has Arrested Them
    Fu Guangqing, the director of the Langfang branch of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Coal Industry General Station, colluded with unscrupulous merchants such as Wang Guangchun to steal 2.6 billion yuan of state property. Fu and Wang refused to confess during the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement and have been arrested and brought to justice.
    Fu Guangqing joined the revolution in 1945 and took a position at the Langfang branch of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Coal Industry General Station in 1950. After Fu Guangqing took office, unscrupulous merchants such as Wang Guangchun, who were only interested in profit, swarmed to surround and corrupt him. The weak-willed Fu Guangqing, after being treated to several meals and accepting bribes, became close confidants with Wang Guangchun and others. He even abandoned revolutionary work, living in Beijing, indulging in pleasure. In March 1951, he devoted all his energy to helping the unscrupulous merchant Wang Guangchun monopolize the transportation of bricks and tiles in Langfang, engaging in contract transportation, which allowed Wang Guangchun to gain a huge profit of 140 million yuan in one go. Fu Guangqing received bribes totaling more than 10 million yuan. Later, Wang Guangchun and Fu Guangqing drafted a plan to jointly build kilns and burn bricks to steal state property, monopolizing more than a dozen local brick kilns. Wang Guangchun also used the huge profits obtained from contract transportation to buy 170 mu of kiln land, asking Fu Guangqing to invest one-sixth of the shares to build twelve kilns in order to steal more state coal and funds. The unscrupulous merchant Wang Guangchun also built a kiln for Fu Guangqing's elder brother and brother-in-law. Fu Guangqing shamelessly deceived his superiors and subordinates, falsely claiming to "support brick kilns in exchange for coal," and successively signed seven contracts with unscrupulous merchants to deceive the state, stealing 2.3 billion yuan of state wealth. Two contracts signed with Wang Guangchun stipulated that 4.4 million bricks were to be produced, for which 924 million yuan was paid. By the expiration date of January 1952, not a single brick had been seen; instead, he lent Wang Guangchun another 5 million yuan. The contract signed with the unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen stipulated that 1.71 million bricks were to be produced, for which 357 million yuan in coal funds was paid. By the expiration date of January 1952, not a single brick had been seen either. All seven contracts were like this. The unscrupulous merchants of the private Da Zhonghua Brick and Tile Kiln, who were unable to repay their debts due to speculation, were also introduced to the coal station by Wang Guangchun, and Fu Guangqing lent them 100 tons of coal, which has not been repaid to this day.
    Regarding the above crimes, Fu Guangqing, Wang Guangchun, and others have shown no remorse and refuse to confess. Therefore, the Anci County People's Court of Hebei Province has decided to arrest them and bring them to justice. (Zhang Jimin)

    傅广庆勾结一伙奸商
    订假合同大量骗款
    安次县人民法院已把他们逮捕
    河北省供销合作社煤业总栈廊坊分栈主任傅广庆和奸商王广春等相互勾结，盗窃国家财产二十六亿元。傅、王二犯在反贪污、反行贿运动中拒不坦白，已被逮捕法办。
    傅广庆在一九四五年参加革命，一九五零年到河北省供销合作社煤业总栈廊坊分栈任职。唯利是图的奸商王广春等在傅广庆到职后，就蜂拥前来，包围腐蚀。意志薄弱的傅广庆在几次被请吃饭、接受贿赂之后，就和王广春等结为心腹。他甚至脱离革命工作，住在北京，荒淫享乐。一九五一年三月，他更以全部精力帮助奸商王广春在廊坊垄断砖瓦的运输，进行包运，使王广春一次就取得暴利一亿四千万元。傅广庆从中受贿总值一千多万元。王广春以后又和傅广庆拟定合股建窑烧砖窃盗国家财产的计划，垄断了当地的十几个砖窑。王广春又把在包运中所得的暴利买了一百七十亩窑地，叫傅广庆投入六分之一的股份，建窑十二个，以便更大量地窃取国家煤栈的煤炭和款项。奸商王广春还给傅广庆的哥哥、内兄单打了一个窑。傅广庆无耻地欺上瞒下，假借“扶植砖窑，以煤换砖”为名，先后和奸商订立了七个欺骗国家的合同，盗走国家财富二十三亿元。有两张和王广春订的两个合同，写明定砖四百四十万块，付出九亿二千四百万元。到一九五二年一月满期，一砖未见；他反又借给王广春五百万元。和奸商王相臣订的合同是定砖一百七十一万块，付煤款三亿五千七百万元。到一九五二年一月期满，也是一砖未见。七个合同都是如此。私营大中华砖瓦窑的奸商因投机倒把欠下了别人的砖不能偿还，也被王广春介绍来煤栈，让傅广庆借给了一百吨煤，至今未还。
    对以上罪行，傅广庆、王广春等至今毫无悔过之心，拒不坦白。所以河北省安次县人民法院决定把他们逮捕法办。（张冀民）
