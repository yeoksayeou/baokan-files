    Guangzhou Customs Uncovers a Case of Treacherous Merchants Smuggling Tin Ingots to Aid the Enemy
    Key Criminal Zeng Qitao and Informants Liang Dehui, etc., Have Been Arrested and Brought to Justice
    Guangzhou Customs, during the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, uncovered a shocking case of planned, illegal smuggling of large quantities of strategic material – tin ingots – for export to supply the needs of American imperialism in its war of aggression against Korea. The key criminal in this case, the treacherous merchant Zeng Qitao, and his informants planted in the Customs, Liang Dehui, Zhong Lunsheng, and Du Yinfu, have been arrested by the Guangzhou People's Court.
    The treacherous merchant Zeng Qitao is the manager of Dechang Customs Brokerage. He colluded with Liang Dehui in smuggling activities during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, they continued their activities that harmed the people of the motherland. After June 1950, when American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea and seriously threatened the security of our country, it began to frantically purchase important military materials—tin (a raw material for manufacturing artillery shells and other war materials) in Hong Kong. Zeng Qitao and other treacherous merchants, disregarding the safety of the people of the motherland and the Korean people, planned to smuggle tin ingots for export to supply American imperialism. They purchased various tinware items in large quantities throughout the country, made them into tin ingots, transported them to Guangzhou, and then coated the outer skin of the tin ingots with acid to make them resemble lead blocks in color, falsely declaring them as "mixed lead" to the Customs for export to Hong Kong. Through Liang Dehui's connections, they bribed Customs appraisers such as Du Yinfu, agreed on code words for customs declaration, and had these disguised "mixed lead" items "appraised" and released solely by Du Yinfu. Statistics from late July to late August 1950 alone show that they smuggled tin ingots disguised as "mixed lead" nineteen times, totaling more than 530,000 catties. At that time, relevant authorities in Shanghai discovered this situation and immediately notified Guangzhou Customs. However, the Guangzhou Customs leadership turned around and ordered Liang Dehui and others to pay attention to the inspection. As a result, the merchants immediately learned of this secret report. The treacherous merchants then changed their method and disguised the tin as type-casting lead for export. But their trick could not escape the sharp eyes of the Customs workers. Customs workers wrote a secret letter to the Customs leadership, exposing this conspiracy. However, at this time, the Customs leadership had not yet noticed the actions of Liang Dehui and others, had not recognized the faces of these "informants," and forwarded the workers' secret report to them, so that Liang and others once again notified the treacherous merchants of this important news.
    After Guangzhou Customs launched a vigorous movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the heinous crimes of these profit-seeking, conscience-stricken treacherous merchants and long-term running dogs serving the interests of the bourgeoisie in smuggling strategic materials for export to supply the enemy, seriously endangering the security and interests of the country and the people, were finally exposed. The Guangzhou People's Court has arrested these criminals and decided to severely punish them according to law.

    广州海关破获奸商大量偷运锡锭资敌案
    要犯曾其滔和坐探梁德辉等已被逮捕法办
    广州海关在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，破获有计划地非法偷运大量战略物资——锡锭出口，供应美帝国主义进行侵略朝鲜战争需要的惊人案件。这一案件的要犯、奸商曾其滔和他安置在海关里的坐探梁德辉、锺伦生和杜荫菔已被广州市人民法院逮捕。
    奸商曾其滔是德昌报关行经理，他在国民党反动政府统治时期，就和梁德辉串同走私。解放后，他们继续进行危害祖国人民的勾当。一九五零年六月，美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜和严重威胁我国安全的战争以后，在香港抢购重要的军事物资——锡
    （制造炮弹和其他战争物资的原料）。曾其滔和其他奸商们竟不顾祖国人民和朝鲜人民的安全，有计划地偷运锡锭出口，供应美帝国主义。他们在国内各地大量收购各种锡器，制成锡锭运来广州，再用镪水淋涂锡锭的外皮，使它变成类似铅块的颜色，冒充“杂铅”，向海关申报出口运赴香港。他们通过梁德辉的关系贿买了海关验估员杜荫菔等，约定了报关时的暗号，把这些伪装的“杂铅”交由杜荫菔一手“验估”放行。只一九五零年七月下旬至八月下旬的统计，就偷运了冒充“杂铅”的锡锭十九次，计达五十三万市斤以上。当时上海有关机关发现了这种情况，当即转告广州海关。而广州海关领导方面竟又转令梁德辉等注意查验。这个密报因此马上就被奸商知道了。奸商们就又改变办法，把锡伪装成铸字粒用铅出口。但是他们的诡计逃不过海关工人的雪亮的眼睛，海关工人写了密告信寄给海关领导方面，揭发了这个阴谋。可是这时海关的领导方面还没有注意到梁德辉等的行动，没有认识到这些“坐探”的面目，将工人的密告又转告他们，以致梁等又再一次将这个重要消息通知奸商。
    广州海关大张旗鼓地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，这些唯利是图泯灭天良的奸商和长期为资产阶级利益服务的走狗们偷运战略物资出口供给敌人，严重危害国家人民的安全和利益的滔天罪行终于被揭发出来。广州市人民法院已将这批罪犯逮捕，决依法严办。
