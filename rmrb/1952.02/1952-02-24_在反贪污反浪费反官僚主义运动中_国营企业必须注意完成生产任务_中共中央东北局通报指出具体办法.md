In the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
State-Owned Enterprises Must Pay Attention to Completing Production Tasks
Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Issues Circular Outlining Specific Measures

After Comrade Gao Gang delivered a report on "Overcoming the Erosion of Bourgeois Ideology on the Party and Opposing Right-leaning Ideologies within the Party" at the meeting of senior cadres of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on January 10th, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in the Northeast has been further developed and has achieved significant results. Some factories and mining enterprises have created good experiences in combining the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign with production. However, many factories and mining enterprises have experienced phenomena such as reduced production, declining quality, and increased accidents during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. For example, in January, among the 49 products in the Ministry of Industry system, 29 did not meet their production targets. The quality of products at the Liaoxi Provincial Ceramic Factory declined by 50% in January. In the Benzene Workshop of the Jinxi Chemical Plant, production was suspended for three days in January due to insufficient supply of raw materials. In another workshop, a power outage occurred for one day due to lax maintenance procedures. In total, since the in-depth development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, this plant has experienced 20 incidents of varying degrees. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in order to draw close attention to this serious problem from leading organs at all levels and to quickly reverse this situation, issued a circular on February 20th. After pointing out the above situations, the circular indicated that the main reasons for these situations are: (1) Leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises have focused on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy while neglecting or relaxing their leadership over production. (2) The focus of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in factories and mining enterprises is on the materials supply and business departments, and many people in these departments are dishonest, some of whom are various types of "tigers." After the in-depth development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, leading cadres at all levels did not make detailed arrangements and provide assistance for the regular business work of these departments. Some enterprises did not promptly replace necessary staff members who were removed after the "tigers" were exposed, and no one was responsible for the work, resulting in untimely supply of raw materials, which affected production.
    (3) A small number of leading cadres in factories and mining enterprises, especially those in charge of materials supply departments, are themselves dishonest and resist the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign with a passive and怠工 attitude.

The circular stated: In order to reverse this situation, leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises, and their superior administrative, Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, should take the following measures: (1) The main administrative leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises and their superior administrative leading organs should implement a system of division of responsibilities. In leading the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the main leading cadres, such as the bureau chief (or deputy bureau chief) and the factory director (or deputy factory director), should designate one person to specifically lead production. Other administrative leading cadres (including those in various departments and sections) should also spend two-thirds of their daily eight-hour working time on leading production and quickly preparing for the production of new products (the leading organs at the enterprise level should provide specific assistance). The remaining one-third of the time and spare time should be used to lead or participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. (2) The leadership should immediately transfer and supplement personnel who are lacking in materials supply and marketing positions due to the exposure of "tigers." Other staff members, even if they are dishonest (but not "tigers"), should be allowed to continue working after receiving serious education if they have truly made a thorough confession and guaranteed that they will not repeat their mistakes in the future, and their work should be strengthened. (3) The administrative side of factories and mining enterprises, especially the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, should strengthen specific ideological education work in connection with the specific ideological situation of the workers in their respective factories and mining enterprises, and repeatedly explain the relationship between the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign and the campaign to increase production and practice economy to all workers. They should call on all workers in state-owned enterprises to actively participate in reporting and exposing various facts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and fight against them, and must complete and exceed the state's production plan, technical plan, and financial plan every hour, every day, and every month with practical actions, and launch a competition movement combining "tiger hunting" and production. (4) When leading cadres of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations at the upper level of factories and mining enterprises go deep into factories and mines to inspect and provide specific assistance to the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in factories and mining enterprises, they must also check the specific implementation of the national production plan of each factory and mine, and at any time summarize the specific experiences of factories and mines that have done a good job in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign and have exceeded production targets. They should disseminate good experiences to subordinate factories and mines through circulars, newspapers, and radio stations, thereby promoting the progress of work. Through the above measures, the Northeast Bureau requires all state-owned (including railways and enterprises under various ministries) and locally-run factories and mining enterprises to guarantee the completion of the production tasks for March and to make up for the unfulfilled figures for January and February within a certain period of time thereafter.

The circular concluded: Other departments, such as finance and taxation, railway transportation, trade, and cooperation, should also check the specific combination of regular business work and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in their respective departments in accordance with this spirit, and report specific experiences to the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at any time.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中
    国营企业必须注意完成生产任务
    中共中央东北局通报指出具体办法
    一月十日高岗同志在中共中央东北局高级干部会议上作了“克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想”报告后，东北国公营厂矿企业中的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，有了进一步的开展和重大的成绩，有些厂矿企业单位，并创造了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义与生产相结合的良好经验。但也有不少厂矿企业在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中发生了减产和质量下降以及事故增多的现象。例如工业部系统各厂矿一月份四十九种产品，有二十九种没有完成生产任务。辽西省营陶磁工厂一月份产品质量下降百分之五十。锦西化工厂力化苯车间一月份由于原材料供应不上，停工三天，另一车间，由于检修制度松懈，发生停电一天的事故，总计这个厂自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动深入开展后，发生大小事故二十次。中共中央东北局为引起各级领导机关密切注意这个严重的问题，迅速扭转这种情况，二月二十日发出了通报。通报指出了以上这些情况之后，指出发生这些情况的主要原因是：（一）厂矿企业的领导干部抓紧了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，而忽视或放松了对生产的领导。（二）厂矿企业反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的重点是材料供应和业务部门，而这些部门中许多人手脚不干净，其中有些是各种各样的“老虎”，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动深入开展后，各级领导干部对这些部门的经常业务工作，没有作细致的布置和帮助，有些企业单位打出“老虎”后所缺的必要工作人员，没有及时配备，工作没人负责，原材料供应不及时，影响了生产。
    （三）少数厂矿企业的领导干部，特别是负责材料供应部门的领导干部，本身手脚不干净，以消极怠工的态度，抗拒反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    通报中说：为了扭转这一情况，厂矿企业的领导干部，及其上级行政、党、工会、青年团的组织，应当采取以下的办法：（一）厂矿企业的主要行政领导干部及其上级行政领导机关，应实行分工负责制，在领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，主要领导干部如局长（或副局长）厂长（副厂长）确定一人专门领导生产，其他行政领导干部（包括各处室、各科室）在每天八小时工作时间以内，亦需以三分之二的时间放在领导生产上，并迅速作好生产新产品的各种准备工作（企业上级的领导机关要加以具体帮助），其余三分之一的时间和业余时间则用以领导或参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。（二）材料供销人员中，由于打出“老虎”所缺人员，领导方面应即速调补；其他工作人员即使手脚不干净（而不是“老虎”），只要他本人真正作了彻底坦白并保证今后不再重犯，在对他进行严肃的教育工作后，仍使他继续工作，并加强对他的工作的检查。（三）厂矿企业的行政方面，特别是党、工会、青年团的组织，应联系本厂矿企业职工的具体思想情况，加强具体的思想教育工作，向全体职工反覆说明反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和增产节约运动的关系，号召国营企业内全体职工除应积极参加检举、揭发各种贪污浪费和官僚主义的事实并与之作斗争外，必须以实际的行动，每时、每日、每月完成和超过国家的生产计划技术计划财务计划，并展开一个“打虎”和生产相结合的竞赛运动。（四）厂矿企业的上级，党、行政、工会和青年团的领导干部，在深入厂矿检查和具体帮助厂矿企业的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，必须同时检查各厂矿国家生产计划完成的具体情况，并随时总结反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动搞得好而又超过生产任务的厂矿的具体经验，通过通报、报纸、广播电台，把好的经验传播所属厂矿，从而推进工作前进。经过上述办法，东北局要求所有国营（包括铁路和各部所属企业）和地方经营的厂矿企业，保证完成三月份的生产任务，并在以后一定的时间内补足一、二两月份未完成任务的数字。
    通报最后说：其他如财政税收、铁路运输、贸易、合作等部门，也应根据这一精神，检查本部门经常业务工作和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动具体结合的情况，并随时把具体经验报告中共中央东北局。
