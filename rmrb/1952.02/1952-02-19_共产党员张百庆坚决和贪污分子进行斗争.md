    Communist Party Member Zhang Baiqing Resolutely Fights Against Grafters
    Xu Jie

    For the sake of the Party and the people's interests, Communist Party member Zhang Baiqing waged a long-term and resolute struggle against grafters, until final victory.

    In the spring of 1950, Zhang Baiqing was transferred from the Shandong Provincial Salt Bureau to the Jinan Salt Industry Branch Company as the head of the Storage and Transportation Section. He noticed that the deputy section chief, Liu Molin, was often sneaking around with the private merchant Li Jie San (who has been arrested), which aroused his attention. Once, the company needed to make a batch of tarpaulin salt covers, and Liu Molin contracted the work to Li Jie San. Someone in the Storage and Transportation Section commented, "We're going to suffer a loss again!" Zhang Baiqing, upon hearing this, inquired everywhere and learned that Liu Molin had exposed state economic secrets in 1949, allowing the profiteer Li Jie San to obtain exorbitant profits. To prevent losses to the branch company, Zhang Baiqing resolutely advocated against allowing Li Jie San to make the salt covers. Liu Molin, full of cunning schemes, flattered Li Jie San's high craftsmanship in front of Manager Dong Jinliang, who had just arrived. As a result, Dong Jinliang approved Li to make ten covers. After using them for less than two months, several had already broken. However, the price was 6.2 million yuan more expensive per piece than those made in Shanghai. Another time, Liu Molin bought two thousand reed mats for 7,900 yuan each; while others bought better quality ones for only 7,300 yuan each. Liu spent 1.2 million yuan more on the two thousand mats. Based on these facts, Zhang Baiqing was certain that Liu Molin was engaging in corruption, and he submitted written reports to the branch company's Party General Branch and administrative side, detailing the information he had gathered. Liu Molin felt that Zhang Baiqing was detrimental to him, so he slandered Zhang Baiqing in front of Manager Dong Jinliang, saying that Zhang was "constantly fighting for power and profit" and said, "If this continues, we won't be able to get any work done." Dong Jinliang listened to Liu Molin's lies and ignored Zhang Baiqing's report, saying that Zhang's "opinions are unreliable, and the Storage and Transportation Section is not united." Zhang Baiqing's correct opinions were thus suppressed by the bureaucrat.

    After this, Liu Molin became even more blatant in his corrupt activities, taking bribes, and stealing state property. In the winter of 1950, Liu Molin even directed the profiteer Li Anshan to bribe administrative leaders of the company to increase the price of washing hemp bags, adding half a liang of rice per bag, resulting in a loss of more than 7,000 jin of millet to the public; moreover, the hemp bags that were washed were often replaced with old ones by the profiteers, who took the opportunity to steal. When Zhang Baiqing discovered this, he advocated for an investigation. However, the grafter Liu Molin defended the profiteers, and Manager Dong Jinliang, because his own hands were not clean, not only did not conduct any investigation but also opposed Zhang Baiqing, saying: "The matter will be handled this way, and if anyone is not satisfied, please go to the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee to complain!" Seeing this situation in the leadership, Zhang Baiqing was determined to wage a resolute struggle against all actions that harmed the interests of the Party. He firmly believed that "as long as we have the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are not afraid that the truth will not prevail!"

    At the end of 1950, the rectification movement began, and Zhang Baiqing again raised the issue of Liu Molin's corruption, bribery, and exposure of economic secrets, demanding that these issues be resolved and dealt with through the rectification movement. However, the leading cadres refused to deal with it, citing the reason of "not disrupting the focus of the rectification movement."

    Zhang Baiqing repeatedly accused Liu Molin's corrupt behavior to the administrative leadership and the Party General Branch, arousing Liu Molin's hatred. Liu Molin then colluded with the counter-revolutionary element Xia Jiqi (who has been executed) to incite dismissed workers to attack Zhang Baiqing. He also wrote letters to the East China District Company and the China Salt Industry Company falsely accusing Zhang Baiqing. These despicable attempts were all shattered by Zhang Baiqing. Later, Liu Molin stirred up trouble in front of the leaders, transferring Zhang Baiqing out. Before leaving, Zhang Baiqing gave a complete oral report to Lu Tai Ting, the deputy secretary of the General Branch, of all the materials he had on Liu Molin. He said: "If we can't bring down the grafters today, I will continue to fight when I come back."

    Last August, Zhang Baiqing returned from the cadre training class of the China Salt Industry Company, and the leaders of the branch company wanted to assign him to the Dezhou Branch Company as manager. Zhang Baiqing had long seen through their intentions, so on the one hand, he raised objections, and on the other hand, he again requested the administrative side and the General Branch to deal with Liu Molin's corruption issue. At that time, the General Branch Secretary Dong Jinliang and General Branch Committee member Kong Zesheng were both closely related to Liu Molin and naturally disagreed with Zhang Baiqing's views. Therefore, until the anti-corruption movement, they did not assign Zhang Baiqing any work and deliberately let him live in the guesthouse. But Zhang Baiqing did not give up his struggle against the grafters because of this. As soon as the anti-corruption struggle began, Zhang Baiqing was the first to respond to the Party's call, actively collecting materials, and reporting Liu Molin's corrupt acts to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee, the Party Committee of the Department of Commerce, and the Party General Branch of the company. At the confession and exposure meeting, he again exposed Liu Molin's criminal acts of colluding with private merchants to steal state property in front of the masses, forcing the grafters to bow their heads and confess their crimes.

    For two years, although Zhang Baiqing suffered various blows and was wrongly suspended from work by bureaucratic leaders, he always persisted in the struggle against the grafters until the final victory. Now, the grafter Liu Molin has been sent to the People's Court for legal punishment. Kong Zesheng, the deputy manager who colluded with the grafter Liu Molin and shielded each other, has also been given the punishment of being removed from his post and investigated.

    Editor's Note: Dong Jinliang, the manager of the Jinan Salt Industry Branch Company mentioned in this article, has unclean hands, protects grafters, and repeatedly suppresses Communist Party member Zhang Baiqing, who actively protects state property. The relevant leading organs should thoroughly investigate this and deal with it seriously.

    共产党员张百庆坚决和贪污分子进行斗争
    徐杰
    为了党和人民的利益，共产党员张百庆和贪污分子进行了长期的坚决的斗争，直到最后胜利。
    一九五零年春，张百庆由山东省盐务局调到济南盐业分公司任储运科长。他发现副科长刘墨林常和私商李杰三（已逮捕）在一道鬼鬼祟祟，这就引起了他的注意。有一次，公司要做一批篷布的盐盖子，刘墨林就包给了李杰三。储运科有人议论说：“我们又要吃亏了！”张百庆听了，到处探询，知道刘墨林在一九四九年曾暴露了国家的经济机密，使奸商李杰三获得暴利。张百庆为了分公司不受损失，坚决主张不让李杰三做盐盖子。刘墨林奸计一生，就在刚来不久的董金梁经理面前，花言巧语地夸耀李杰三手艺高强，结果董金梁就批准让李做了十块。做成后，使了不到两个月，就破碎了好几块。但价格却比在上海做的每块贵六十二万元。又一次，刘墨林买了两千领席子，每领七千九百元；而别人买的比他买的质量好，每领才七千三百元。刘买了两千领席子，就多花一百二十万元。根据这些事实，张百庆肯定刘墨林有贪污行为，就把自己了解的情况分别向分公司的党总支和行政方面作了书面报告。刘墨林感到张百庆对自己不利，就在经理董金梁面前诬蔑张百庆“整天争权夺利”，并说：“这样下去，工作没法干。”董金梁听信了刘墨林的谎言，对张百庆的报告置之不理，说张的“意见不可靠，储运科闹不团结”。张百庆的正确意见，就这样被官僚主义者压下去了。
    这以后，刘墨林就更明目张胆地进行贪污、受贿、盗窃国家资财的勾当。一九五零年冬，刘墨林竟指使奸商李菴山贿赂公司行政领导干部，提高包洗麻袋的价格，每条增加半两米，结果公家损失七千多斤小米；而且所洗的麻袋，经常被奸商抽新换旧，乘机盗窃。事情被张百庆识破，主张追查。但贪污分子刘墨林却为奸商辩护，经理董金梁因为自己手脚不干净，不仅不作任何追查，反对张百庆说：“事情就这样处理，谁不服气，请到中共中央山东分局去告吧！”张百庆看到领导方面的这种情况，就下定决心和一切损害党的利益的行为作坚决斗争。他坚信“只要有毛主席的领导，不怕真理不胜利”！
    一九五零年底，整风运动开始，张百庆又把刘墨林贪污、受贿、暴露经济机密的问题提出来，要求通过整风解决和处理这些问题。但是领导干部却以“不要搞乱整风重点”为理由，拒绝处理。
    张百庆一次再一次地向行政领导方面、党总支控告刘墨林的贪污行为，引起了刘墨林的怀恨。刘墨林乃勾结反革命分子夏继起（已处死刑）煽动被解雇的工人攻击张百庆。并写信向华东区公司和中国盐业公司诬告张百庆。这些卑鄙企图都被张百庆一一粉碎。后来，刘墨林在领导者面前搬弄是非，把张百庆调出去。张百庆在临走前，把自己掌握的所有关于刘墨林的材料，全部向总支副书记吕泰亭作了口头报告。并说：“今天斗不倒贪污分子，回来后我还要斗争下去。”
    去年八月，张百庆由中国盐业公司干部训练班回来，分公司领导人就要分配他到德州支公司任经理。张百庆早识破了他们的意图，因此他一面提出不同意见，另一方面再次要求行政方面和总支处理刘墨林的贪污问题。当时总支书记董金梁、总支委员孔泽生都和刘墨林关系密切，自然不同意张百庆的意见。因此直到反贪污运动以前，他们不给张百庆分配工作，故意让他住在招待所里。但张百庆并未因此而放弃了和贪污分子的斗争。这次反贪污斗争一开始，张百庆首先响应了党的号召，积极地搜集材料，分别向中共中央山东分局纪律检查委员会、商业厅党委会及公司党总支报告了刘墨林的贪污事实。在坦白、检举大会上，他又在群众面前，揭发了刘墨林勾结私商盗窃国家资财的罪恶行为，迫使贪污分子低头认罪。
    两年来，张百庆虽然受到种种打击，且被官僚主义的领导者错误地停止过工作，但他始终坚持了和贪污分子的斗争到最后胜利。现在，贪污分子刘墨林已被送人民法院依法惩办。和贪污分子刘墨林勾结一起，互相包庇的副经理孔泽生也受到撤职查办的处分。
    　编者按：本文所提到的济南盐业分公司经理董金梁手面不干净，庇护贪污分子，一再打击积极保护国家财产的共产党员张百庆。对此，有关的领导机关应加以彻底检查，严肃处理。
