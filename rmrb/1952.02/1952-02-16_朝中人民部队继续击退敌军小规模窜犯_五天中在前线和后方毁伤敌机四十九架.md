Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 15th: Our frontline reporter reports: In the five days from February 6th to 10th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers repulsed more than twenty small-scale enemy incursions at the front. The fighting was relatively frequent on the Kimhwa front these days, and the U.S. invading army's 40th Infantry Division, which was transferred from Japan, continued to be resolutely attacked by our army during its continuous offensives. On the 6th, a company of the division advanced towards a certain height east of Kimhwa and was repelled by our dense firepower, with more than 60 enemy casualties. On the 7th, a squad of the division sneaked to a certain place southeast of Kimhwa and was ambushed by our army and completely wiped out.

	In other areas of the front, our army also defeated the enemy with flexible and ingenious tactics. On the 6th, an enemy company attacked a hilltop position of our army north of Cheorwon. After our brave fighters inflicted heavy casualties on the invading enemy with various automatic weapons and hand grenades, they temporarily evacuated the position. When the enemy, exhausted, climbed the mountain, our brave fighters launched a counterattack like tigers. After ten minutes of fighting, they inflicted casualties on part of the enemy and recovered the position. In this battle, our army inflicted casualties on more than 60 enemy soldiers with only a small force.

	On the periphery of the Panmunjom conference area, on the 7th, an enemy platoon, under the cover of twelve tanks, advanced towards Pyeongchang-dong area, only four kilometers south of Panmunjom, and was again repelled by our army.

	In the first five days of February, our air defense units shot down and damaged a total of forty-nine enemy aircraft in the skies above the front and the rear.

    朝中人民部队继续击退敌军小规模窜犯
    五天中在前线和后方毁伤敌机四十九架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】本社前线记者报道：在二月六日到十日的五天中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在前线击退了敌军二十多次小规模的窜犯。这几天金城前线的战斗较为频繁，从日本调来的美国侵略军第四十步兵师，在不断的进犯中继续遭到我军坚决的打击。六日，该师的一个连向金城以东某高地进犯，被我密集火力击退，敌伤亡六十多人。七日，该师一个班窜至金城东南某处，又遭到我军的伏击而全部被歼。
    在前线其它地方，我军也以灵活巧妙的战术战胜敌人。六日，敌军一个连向铁原以北我军一处山头阵地进攻。我军勇士们用各种自动火器和手榴弹大量杀伤进犯的敌人后，暂时撤离了阵地。等敌人力竭气衰地爬到山上时，我军勇士们猛虎般地发起反击，经十分钟的战斗，杀伤敌军一部后收复了阵地。这次战斗中，我军仅以小部队即杀伤敌军六十多人。
    在板门店会场区外围前线，七日敌军一个排在十二辆战车掩护下，向板门店以南仅四公里的平昌洞地区进犯，又被我军击退。
    在二月初的五天中，我防空部队在前线和后方的上空，共击落击伤敌军飞机四十九架。
