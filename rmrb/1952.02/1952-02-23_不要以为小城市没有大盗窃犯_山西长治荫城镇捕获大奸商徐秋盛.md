Don't Think Small Cities Don't Have Big Thieves
Big Profiteer Xu Qiusheng Captured in Yincheng Town, Changzhi, Shanxi

In remote small and medium-sized towns, profiteers are also launching rampant attacks on our state organs and state enterprises. Xu Qiusheng, of the Fuxing Ironware Store in Yincheng Town, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, is one such insidious and cunning big profiteer. Over the years, he has used despicable and shameless means to corrupt hundreds of our cadres and steal 1.1 billion yuan in state assets. After the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence was launched, and after exposure by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and cadres, the People's Government has arrested the criminal Xu.

Xu Qiusheng's means of attacking the state were extremely base and vicious. He first courted the relevant leading organs to gain so-called "political capital." At the beginning of establishing his private iron furnace, he defrauded the CPC Huguan County Committee and the Huguan County People's Government of 10 million yuan each in shares. From then on, every New Year and holiday, he used large carts to send meat, rice, moon cakes, white wine, etc., to the organs. He used shameless means such as inviting them to dinner, giving gifts, and lending money to the organs and groups stationed in Yincheng Town to deceive cadres into buying shares in his business. He also pretended to be active in order to deceive leading cadres into trusting him, using this as capital for speculation, smuggling, tax evasion, and theft of assets.

Xu Qiusheng extensively bribed and laid traps. Xiang Anxi, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Huguan County Committee, had led the masses in a resolute struggle against Xu Qiusheng during the land reform. But after he was bribed by Xu Qiusheng in 1950, he said that Xu Qiusheng was a "good person." In order to buy over the masses in his village, Xu Qiusheng pretended to lend grain to the masses, and then openly scolded the Party and the government, and sowed discord between the Party, the government, and the masses. But the cadres who had been bribed by him deliberately pretended not to hear.

The main target of criminal Xu's attack was a certain factory in the Changzhi Special District. In order to steal state assets in large quantities, criminal Xu painstakingly seduced some vacillating elements in this factory to join him. In addition to extensive bribery and gift-giving, in the spring of 1950, Xu Qiusheng also absorbed Ma Luqin, the head of the business section of this factory, into his business with shares worth 4.04 million yuan. In the first half of last year, when Ma Luqin asked him to settle accounts, Xu said to Ma: "What's there to calculate? The principal and interest have already reached 20 million yuan." This was clearly bribery. In order to steal state assets, criminal Xu also used the seduction scheme. He gave his own daughter to Niu Defu, the deputy director of a certain factory, as his wife. From then on, criminal Xu freely entered and exited the factory and carried out activities on a large scale. The construction of dormitories, the opening of flour mills, the purchase of raw materials, and the sale of waste products in these factories were all inseparable from Xu Qiusheng. As the workers reflected: "Our factory has fattened Xu Qiusheng. He enters the factory gate swaggering, and the factory director treats him as a distinguished guest." The workers were very dissatisfied with this and discussed: "They go to Xu Qiusheng's place and indulge in extravagant entertainment; Xu Qiusheng uses a bone to coax them (referring to the deputy factory director, etc.) into a daze, letting him lead the cow away. Our factory has produced spendthrifts. Our hard work and frugality is not enough for them to give gifts."

After criminal Xu set up the trap, he colluded with these corrupt and degenerate elements, working from both inside and outside, to steal state assets in large quantities. In the past two years, with the help of Ma Luqin, Feng Chunwang, Niu Defu, and others, criminal Xu successively purchased 2.6 million catties of pig iron from factories in Changzhi, Huguan, Lingchuan, and other places. This batch of pig iron was not only cheap, but according to existing materials and Xu's confession, it also included 230,000 catties of steel, 20,000 catties of gray pig iron, 300 catties of lead iron, as well as machine parts, spring steel, bamboo steel, tin tools, and other items. This item alone stole more than 542 million yuan in state assets. When a certain factory sold gasoline drums, the market price was 180,000 yuan each, but Xu could "buy" them for only 80,000 yuan.

Xu Qiusheng also used the method of contracting orders, receiving deposits, and delaying delivery to occupy huge amounts of public funds and engage in speculation. Criminal Xu also frequently evaded state taxes. More than 21 million yuan has been found to have been evaded. According to existing materials alone, in the past two years, criminal Xu has stolen a total of 1.1 billion yuan in state assets.

    不要以为小城市没有大盗窃犯
    山西长治荫城镇捕获大奸商徐秋盛
    在偏僻的中小城镇里，奸商们同样向我们的国家机关和国家企业进行猖狂的进攻。山西省长治县荫城镇的复兴铁货栈的徐秋盛，就是一个阴险狡猾的大奸商。几年来，他用卑鄙无耻的手段，腐蚀了我们成百个干部，盗窃了国家资财十一亿元。反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争展开后，经过广大职工、农民和干部的检举揭发，人民政府已把徐犯逮捕。
    徐秋盛向国家进攻的手段是非常卑鄙毒辣的。他首先拉拢有关领导机关，骗取所谓“政治资本”。他在搞私人铁炉之初，曾骗取了中共壶关县委员会、壶关县人民政府股金各一千万元。从此，每逢过年过节，就用大车给机关送肉、大米、月饼、白酒等。他对驻在荫城镇的机关团体，则以请吃饭、送礼、借款等无耻手段，骗取干部在他那里入股。他还假装积极，以骗取领导干部对他的信任，作为他投机倒把、走私漏税、盗窃资财的资本。
    徐秋盛广泛行贿，密布圈套。中共壶关县委宣传部副部长向安喜，在土地改革中，曾领导群众向徐秋盛作过坚决斗争。但当一九五零年他受了徐秋盛的贿赂后，竟说徐秋盛是个“好人”。徐秋盛为了收买他村群众，假意借给群众粮食，然后公开地谩骂党和政府，并挑拨离间党、政府和群众之间的关系。但受过他贿赂的干部却故意装着听不见。
    徐犯的主要进攻目标是长治专区某工厂。为了大批盗窃国家资财，徐犯曾费尽心机，勾引这个厂的一些意志不坚定的分子下水。除大批行贿送礼外，一九五零年春，徐秋盛还吸收这个厂的经营科长马履勤股金四百零四万元。去年前半年，马履勤请他给算账时，徐犯告马说：“那还算什么，本利已到两千万元了。”这显然是行贿。徐犯为了盗窃国家资财，还使用美人计。他把他的亲闺女送给某厂副厂长牛德夫为妻。从此，徐犯即自由进出工厂，大肆活动。这些工厂修宿舍、开粉坊、购原料、卖废品，大小事都离不了徐秋盛。正如工人反映：“我们工厂可把徐秋盛养肥了，进了厂门，大摇大摆，厂长把他供为上宾。”工人对此十分不满，纷纷议论：“他们到徐秋盛那里，花天酒地；人家徐秋盛拿根骨头就把他们（指副厂长等）哄得晕头转向，让人家把牛牵走了。我们厂出了败家子。我们辛勤俭省，还不够他们送礼的。”
    徐犯布置好圈套后，就勾结这些贪污蜕化分子，里应外合，大批盗窃国家资财。二年来徐犯在马履勤、冯春旺、牛德夫等人的帮助下，曾先后在长治、壶关、陵川等地，购买工厂生铁二百六十万斤。这批生铁不但价格低，并且据现有材料及徐犯自供，其中还拣出钢料二十三万斤、灰生铁两万斤、铅铁三百斤，还有机器零件、盘簧钢、竹节钢、锡工工具等物。单这一项，就盗窃国家资财五亿四千二百多万元。某工厂出售汽油桶，市价十八万元一个，徐犯只用八万元就可“买”去。
    徐秋盛还用承揽定货、领取定金、迟不交货的办法，占用巨额公款，投机倒把。徐犯还经常偷漏国家税收。已查明的有两千一百余万元。仅据现有材料统计，二年来，徐犯共盗窃国家资财十一亿元。
