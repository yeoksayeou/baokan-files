    How the Propagandists of the Beijing People's Printing Factory Operated in the Struggle to Besiege the Major Embezzler Song Enming
    Baolun, Peng Jing
    The major embezzler Song Enming was originally the head of the repair and manufacturing section in the machinery department of the Beijing People's Printing Factory. In the three years after liberation, he embezzled more than 160 million yuan by means of eating privately and using substandard materials in place of good materials.
    At the beginning of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Song Enming was very "steady." When the masses raised some questions of suspicion, he either pretended to be dismissive or used "I'm old, I can't remember things clearly" as an excuse to evade them. The propagandists analyzed the situation and knew that he wanted to slip through the group meeting, escape the net, and avoid scrutiny before the entire workshop's firepower was concentrated. Therefore, the propagandists quickly ended the general propaganda and completely turned the propaganda firepower towards him. First, the propagandists collected some facts that everyone did not remember very well and compiled a rhythmic talk: "Our department, just after liberation, was poorly managed and the system was chaotic. Stealing materials, giving favors, and unclear receipt and dispatch of materials. Section Chief Song, Liu Peiren, colluded to play tricks. Old materials were bought as new materials, and inferior goods were said to be 'no problem.' Now, we must recognize that the public's property is watched by everyone." At the same time, large slogans were posted on the wall of Song Enming's office: "If you don't want people to know, don't do it," "If you want to pass this test, confess thoroughly," "Don't rely on your age and pretend to be confused, only confession is the way out." In addition, the suspicious questions raised by everyone at the group meeting were published one by one through the blackboard newspaper, such as: "Why was the pipe bought by Song Enming in 1949 thick on one side and thin on the other?" "Why was the 'cutter head' he bought not strong enough?" and so on, calling on everyone to use their brains and think: "Besides these questions, what other questions have not been raised?" Some workers, especially those who had learned skills from Song Enming in the past, were still a little embarrassed and afraid to boldly express their opinions when they first saw this call. At this time, the propagandists organized activists to carry out in-depth ideological mobilization: repeatedly explaining the significance of anti-corruption and the principle that everyone is responsible for anti-corruption. As a result, the public's attention began to focus, and some said: "I had forgotten about him." Some people who thought Song Enming would not have big problems also began to consider carefully. As a result, more than 80% of the questions at the group meeting were directed at Song Enming. Some workers exposed Song Enming in public, saying: "The pipe he bought in 1949 was very bad. I asked him why it was so bad, and he said: 'Just use it for now, there will be benefits later.' Now I want to ask him, what does that mean?"
    Under the pressure of the masses, Song Enming began to panic a little. He began to admit some problems such as colluding with private merchants and eating and drinking; however, he "talked about the small but not the big" and "talked about the distant but not the near." In order not to give him a chance to catch his breath and to take advantage of the victory, the propagandists launched another propaganda offensive. First, they performed a quick-talking skit that exposed and mobilized him: first, a person dressed as Song Enming used quick-talking to sing out Song Enming's situation of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial: "Whatever happens, I will say, I can't 'carry that black pot anymore.' There were so many problems before, I shouldn't have 'drunk people's tea.' I have 'no' corruption now, someone sent money, but I didn't keep it. Comrades, please investigate, open a way, ah! I'll climb up the pole." Then, a person dressed as a worker from the workshop came on stage to denounce him severely and used quick-talking to reason with him and tell him the policy: "Please put aside the idea of passing the test and tell the truth. All kinds of problems are in front of you, please talk about them quickly. If you talk clearly, that's fine, but if you're unclear, it won't work." "Everyone means well, but you don't consider it. If you don't confess, we'll have to report you. By then, don't regret it. If you act like a ghost, you'll smash your own legs." While performing this skit, they also strengthened the exposure of him through cartoons. For example, they drew Song Enming's "stubborn fortress" being breached by artillery fire, and he ran out in a panic, wanting to escape, but still holding on to the "corruption" package tightly. A huge, strong worker pointed at him and said: "You must throw away the package!" For example, they drew Song Enming standing in the middle of the crowd, covered with plasters, some of which said "eating privately" and some said "taking bribes." The crowd pointed at him and said: "We know all about your illness." In addition, they also composed a short opera for him, which was sung every day at noon. In order to urge him to further develop his ideological struggle, they sent him "couplets," such as "Eliminate concerns, confess thoroughly" (right couplet), "The future is bleak, repentance is the shore" (left couplet), "Confess everything at once" (horizontal scroll), etc. These propagandas played a very important role in further exposing and isolating Song Enming. A worker who had learned skills from Song Enming wrote in the question and answer column: "Song Enming: I was taught by you, but I can't help you, because you are too dishonest. Now I warn you: confess quickly, or we will concentrate our strength and attack you."
    All the masses acted in unison to expose his embezzlement facts. In this situation, Song Enming was forced to confess some problems: he admitted some small embezzlement facts in 1949 and 1950. However, it was not thorough. In response to this situation, the propagandists immediately compiled the problems he confessed into quick-talking and turned the inconsistencies between his confession and Liu Peiren's into a short opera and sang it out, mobilizing everyone to continue to ask questions and find contradictions. This short opera was very successful. The first part of the short opera directly and implicitly pointed out that it is necessary to seize the contradictions of embezzlers and pursue them relentlessly: "Since the factory launched the 'Three-Anti' campaign, the group has been talking about corruption. Old Song said: 'I took a bribe of 10,000 yuan that time and gave 2,000 yuan to Old Liu.' What Old Liu said was quite different. He said: 'No, no, it was 5,000 yuan.' Consistency of contradictions is correct! Oh dear, you are so dishonest, what should we do?" At the same time, the propagandists systematically carried out various aspects of enlightenment and mobilization for him. At that time, an activist also compiled a story for Song Enming: "In ancient times, there was a monk who specialized in treating tigers. Once in the mountains, he met a tiger with a serious illness. He took a look and quickly found the source of the disease. He said to the tiger: 'You got this disease because you ate too many people. To cure it, you must pull out your teeth and scrape your flesh.' At first, the tiger was afraid of the pain and dared not be treated. At that time, the monk said to it: 'You did bad things, you should suffer the consequences. But today, since I met you, a person who specializes in treating tigers, I must treat you.' Later, the tiger endured the pain, pulled out its teeth, and scraped its flesh, and the disease was cured." He often told this story in a vivid way, linking it with reality, in public places where Song Enming was present. Some workers said after listening to this story: "The tiger's disease has been cured, I don't believe the embezzler's disease can't be cured."
    In a situation where the propaganda work made Song Enming unable to hold his head up and unable to stand firm, the factory held an anti-corruption struggle meeting on January 7, at which the major embezzler Wang Huatang was arrested. This was a great shock to Song Enming. Grasping his psychological changes, the relevant parties immediately conducted another individual conversation with him after the meeting: on the one hand, they once again pointed out to him that two roads were placed before him. If he continued to play tricks with the leaders and workers and refused to confess, he would only take Wang Huatang's road; on the other hand, they pointed out to him that he had fallen into a situation of being besieged on all sides, and if he did not confess thoroughly now, he would only have a dead end. At this point, Song Enming had no way to retreat completely, so in this conversation he confessed eight problems in a row and admitted that he had embezzled more than 160 million yuan in the past three years.
    The propagandists of the Machinery Department summarized three experiences in their propaganda work this time: (1) Expose without reservation. (2) Concentrate propaganda firepower. (3) Be fast and "keep up step by step." These experiences are completely applicable to the current propaganda work of besieging embezzlers.

    北京人民印刷厂的宣传员在围攻大贪污犯宋恩铭的斗争中是怎样活动的
    宝伦　彭静
    大贪污犯宋恩铭原在北京人民印刷厂机务科任修造股长。解放后三年来，他用吃私、坏料顶好料等方式贪污了一亿六千多万元。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动刚开始时，宋恩铭很“稳”。群众提出了一些怀疑问题，他不是装出一种不屑一答的神气，就是以“我老了，事情记不清了”为藉口来搪塞。宣传员分析了情况，知道他是想在全车间火力还没有集中的时候，轻轻滑过小组会这一关，漏网而逃。因此，宣传员很快地结束了一般性的宣传，把宣传火力完全转向他的身上。首先，宣传员们搜集了一些大家记不太清的事实，编出了快板：“我们科，刚解放，管理不周制度乱。偷材料，送人情，收发材料弄不清。宋股长、刘培仁，狼狈为奸耍花灯。旧料当作新料买，劣货硬说‘没问题’。到如今，要认清，公家财物大伙盯。”同时，在宋恩铭办公地点的墙上，贴上大标语：“要想人不知，除非己莫为”，“要想过这关，彻底来坦白”，“不要依老卖老装糊涂，只有坦白是出路”。另外，又把小组会上大家所提的怀疑问题。如：“一九四九年宋恩铭经手买的管子，为什么一边厚，一边薄？”“他买的‘刀头’为什么钢性不好？”等，通过黑板报一一公布出去，号召大家开动脑筋想：“除了这些问题以外，还有那些问题没有提出？”有些工友，特别是过去跟宋恩铭学过手艺的工友，刚一看到这个号召，还有些破不开情面，不敢大胆提意见。这时宣传员就组织积极分子进行深入的思想动员：反复地讲解反贪污的意义，讲解反贪污人人有责等道理。这样一来，群众的视线就开始集中了，有的说：“我倒把他给忘了。”有些认为宋恩铭不会有多大问题的人也开始仔细考虑。结果，小组会上有百分之八十以上的问题都是提给宋恩铭的。有的工友当众揭发宋恩铭说：“一九四九年他买的管子非常不好，我问他为什么这样糟糕，他说：‘凑合用吧，以后有好处。’我现在要问他，这话怎讲？”
    在群众压力下，宋恩铭开始有点慌张了，他开始承认了一些和私商拉拢，吃吃喝喝等问题；但是，“谈小不谈大”、“谈远不谈近”。为了不给他以喘息的机会，乘胜追击，宣传员就又发动了一次宣传攻势。首先，他们演了一个揭露、动员他的快板活报剧：先由扮做宋恩铭的人把宋恩铭避重就轻的情形，用快板唱出：“有什么事儿，我都说，不能‘再背那黑锅’。以前的问题特别多，不该把人家的‘茶来喝’。现在的贪污‘我没有’，有人送钞票，可是我不留。叫同志：请你们查，开条路来，嗳！我就顺杆儿爬。”然后，由扮本车间工人的上场把他加以痛斥，并用快板对他讲道理，讲政策：“过关思想请放下，还是说点老实话。各种问题在面前，还是请你快点谈。谈得清，那就行，不清不明可不成。”“大伙儿是好意，你却不考虑，你要不坦白，只好把你来检举。到那时，莫后悔，鬼来鬼去，你呀，砸了自己的腿。”和演这个活报剧的同时，又通过漫画加强了对他的揭露。如，画宋恩铭住着的“顽固堡垒”已被炮火攻破，他慌张地跑了出来想逃命，但仍死死地抓住“贪污”包袱不放，后面一个巨大的强壮的工人用手指着他说：“一定要扔下包袱！”又如，画宋恩铭站在众人中间，他的身上贴满了膏药，有的膏药上写着“吃私”，有的上写着“受贿”，众人用手指着他说：“你的病我们全知道。”此外，还给他编了洋片，每天中午演唱。为了督促他进一步展开思想斗争，给他送“对联”，如，“打消顾虑，彻底坦白”（右联）、“前途茫茫，回头是岸”（左联）、“一次谈清”（横联）等。这些宣传对进一步揭穿、孤立宋恩铭起了非常大的作用。一个跟宋恩铭学过手艺的工友在问答栏上写道：“宋恩铭：我是你教出来的，但是我没办法帮助你，因为你太不老实了。现在我警告你：赶快坦白，否则我们就要集中力量向你进攻。”
    所有的群众都一致行动起来揭发他的贪污事实，宋恩铭在这种情况下，被迫又交代了些问题：承认了一些一九四九年和一九五○年的小额贪污事实。但是，不彻底。针对着这个情况，宣传员立刻把他交代的问题编成快板，把他和刘培仁坦白不一致的地方编成洋片唱出去，发动大家继续提问题、找矛盾。这个洋片很成功，洋片的第一篇就直接而又含蓄地指出：必须抓住贪污分子的矛盾穷追猛打：“自从厂子里搞‘三反’，小组就把贪污谈，老宋说：‘那次受贿一万块，给了老刘两千元’，老刘说的可拧劲儿啊，他说：‘不对，不对，是五千元。’矛盾统一才算对呀！唉哟，这样不老实噢，大伙说该怎么办？”与此同时，宣传员又有计划地对他进行了各方面的启发、动员。当时，有一个积极分子还针对着宋恩铭编了一个故事：“古时候，有一个和尚，他专会给老虎治病。有一次在山里，遇见一只得了重病的老虎，他看了一下，很快地就找到了病源，他对老虎说：‘你得这病，是因为吃人太多了，要想治非拔牙剐肉不行。’最初，老虎怕疼不敢治，当时和尚就对它说：‘你做了坏事，本应自食其果。但是，今天既遇见了我这个专会给老虎治病的人，我就一定要给你治治。’后来，老虎忍疼拔了牙、剐了肉，病也好了。”他常在宋恩铭在场的群众场合下，联系实际、有声有色地讲。有的工友听完这个故事说：“老虎的病都治好了，我就不信贪污分子的病治不好。”
    在宣传工作使宋恩铭抬不起头、立不住脚的情况下，一月七日全厂开了反贪污斗争大会，会上逮捕了大贪污犯王画堂。这对宋恩铭是一个很大的震动。抓住了他的心理变化，会后有关方面马上又对他进行了一次个别谈话：一方面再一次对他指出：两条道路摆在他眼前，如果继续和领导方面和工友们耍鬼，拒不坦白，就只有走王画堂的道路；另一方面向他指出：他已陷入四面楚歌的境地，现在如果还不彻底坦白，只有死路一条。至此，宋恩铭完全无路可退了，因而在这次谈话中他一连交代了八个问题，并承认了三年来共贪污一亿六千多万元。
    机务科宣传员在总结他们这次宣传工作时，提出三点经验：（一）要毫无保留地进行揭露。（二）宣传火力要集中。（三）要快，要“步步紧”。这些经验，对目前围攻贪污分子的宣传工作是完全适用的。
