Hugo's great works reflected the demands of the broad masses of people at the time who were fighting for justice, freedom, and progressive ideas. The Chinese people love and cherish Hugo's works, considering them a common treasure of the world's people. In today's era when peace-loving people all over the world are waging a great struggle to defend world peace and strengthen cultural exchanges, our commemoration of Hugo is of even greater significance. The Chinese people are willing to join hands with the French people to work together to defend world peace and strengthen the exchange of people's cultures."
