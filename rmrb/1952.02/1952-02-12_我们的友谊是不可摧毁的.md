    Our Friendship is Indestructible
    Peter Chepurov, Engineer of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station Construction Bureau

    Two years ago, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed in Moscow. The Soviet people expressed great joy and support for the signing of this treaty. The tremendous changes that have taken place in the young People's Republic of China over the past two years have aroused the admiration of all the Soviet people.

    The workers and engineers of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory are very happy to know that China's industry is now capable of manufacturing tractors. The people of Stalingrad are always ready to use their rich experience to help China's young tractor manufacturers. The metallurgical workers of Stalingrad extend their heartfelt respect to the Chinese steel workers who are bravely learning high-speed steelmaking techniques. The construction workers of heroic Stalingrad greatly admire the achievements of the Chinese bricklayers, carpenters, and plasterers, who are building beautiful dormitories, schools, universities, and new theater buildings for the Chinese people. The people of Stalingrad, who are engaged in the great work of transforming nature, greatly admire the achievements of the builders of the Huai River water conservancy project, which is being carried out according to the initiative of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.

    The heroic labor of the Chinese people is an extremely important contribution to the struggle for peace and against the new war instigators of the United States and Britain.

    The Soviet people understand and sympathize with the anger and hatred of the Chinese and Korean people toward the unprecedented crimes committed by the American and British interventionists on Korean soil, their occupation of China's Taiwan, and their thieving and provocative attacks on Chinese cities and villages. We admire the heroes who fight for the freedom of Korea and the inviolability of the great Chinese border, and we admire their courage and strength.

    On the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, I would like to sincerely congratulate the Chinese comrades and wish them new victories in building a new life and in the struggle for peace.

    I am very happy to report to you about our peaceful labor. The revival of Stalingrad's industry has not only been achieved, but has also surpassed pre-war production levels. The workers of Stalingrad are producing tractors, metals, machines, clothing, shoes, etc. for the country with ever-increasing output. The workers of Stalingrad have also learned to produce suction dredgers, which are necessary for the construction of huge hydroelectric power stations and canals. Each such suction dredger can suck up one thousand cubic meters of soil in one hour. New, beautiful, and well-equipped residences, schools, and theaters continue to be built on a large scale in Stalingrad. Last year, the residential area of our city increased by more than 150,000 square meters. Now, hundreds of new houses are still under construction.

    The builders of the Volga-Don Navigation Canal, which is one hundred and one kilometers long, have achieved great success. The canal will begin to be navigable from this spring. Stalingrad will become a port of five seas.

    I am one of the builders of the world's greatest Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station. New production victories have been achieved in the construction of this hydroelectric power station. All of our staff completed twice the annual plan in 1951. At the same time, hundreds of outstanding Stakhanovite workers have emerged, and they have fully mastered the powerful machines that the state has supplied us in large quantities.

    The Volga-Don Canal and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, with its huge reservoir and huge irrigation system, will transform large areas of the semi-desert dry grasslands. Millions of hectares of land will be irrigated and supplied with water.

    These great projects are being carried out according to the plan of our great leader and teacher, Stalin. The Stalinist communist construction projects, with their magnificent scale, inspire us, consolidate the strength of our glorious Soviet motherland, and bring us closer to communism. These great projects are the best proof of the Soviet people's peaceful construction labor. We need peace because we want to build new houses, schools, hydroelectric power stations, and canals, we want to sow grain, we want to plant trees on the grasslands, and we want to cultivate and educate our young generation in the spirit of communism. Therefore, we spare no effort to safeguard the cause of peace. Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world, is the first fighter in safeguarding the cause of peace.

    I sincerely hope that the immortal friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet peoples will be strengthened and developed, for the peace of the world and for the prosperity of free China.

    我们的友谊是不可摧毁的
    斯大林格勒水电站工程处工程师  彼得·切蒲罗夫
    两年前，在莫斯科签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。苏联人民对于这个条约的签订表示非常的欢喜与拥护。两年来在年青的中华人民共和国国内所发生的巨大变革，更引起了全体苏联人民的赞叹。
    斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂的工人们和工程师们很高兴地知道，中国的工业已能制造拖拉机了。斯大林格勒人随时准备用自己丰富的经验来帮助中国的年青的拖拉机制造者。斯大林格勒的冶金工人对于正在勇敢地学习高速炼钢技术的中国炼钢工人，致以衷心的敬意。英雄的斯大林格勒的建筑工人非常赞仰中国砌砖工人、木工、泥工的成就，他们在为中国人民建造着美丽的宿舍，建造着学校、大学和剧院的新建筑。正在从事改造自然的巨大工作的斯大林格勒人，对于按照中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东的倡议而进行着淮河水利工程的建设者们的成就，非常钦佩。
    中国人民的英雄劳动，对于争取和平、反对美英新战争挑拨者这一斗争，是极有贡献的。
    美英干涉者在朝鲜土地上制造着前所未闻的罪行，侵占了中国的台湾，并对中国的城市和乡村施行着强盗般的挑拨性的袭击；中朝人民对于他们的愤怒与仇恨，苏联人是非常理解、非常亲切的。我们佩服为朝鲜自由和伟大中国边疆的不可侵犯而战斗的英雄们，佩服他们的勇敢和坚强。
    在中苏同盟条约签订两周年的日子，我愿衷心地祝贺中国同志们，希望他们在建设新生活中、在争取和平的斗争中获得新的胜利。
    我很高兴地向你们报告一下我们的和平劳动。斯大林格勒工业的复兴，不仅已经达到了，而且还超过了战前生产水平。斯大林格勒的工人以增进不已的产量，给国家生产拖拉机、金属、机器、衣服、鞋子等。斯大林格勒的工人也学会了生产吸土机，这种机器是建设巨大的水电站与运河所必需的。每一架这样的吸土机在一点钟里能吸土一千立方公尺。在斯大林格勒继续大规模地修建新的、美丽的、设备齐全的住宅、学校和剧院。去年，我们城市的居住面积增加了十五万平方公尺以上。现在，还在兴建着几百幢新房屋。
    全长一百零一公里的伏尔加河—顿河航行运河底建筑人员，已经获得了巨大的成就。从今年春天起，运河将开始通航。斯大林格勒将成为五海之港。
    我是世界上最伟大的斯大林格勒水电站的建设人员之一。在这个水电站的建造中，已经获得了新的生产的胜利。我们全体工作人员在一九五一年内完成了全年计划的两倍。同时，涌现了成百的出色的斯达哈诺夫工作者，他们已经充分地掌握了国家大量供给我们的强有力的机器。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河和具有巨大的水库与庞大的灌溉系统的斯大林格勒水电站，将改变半沙漠的干燥的草原的大片地区。将有数百万公顷的土地受到灌溉和供水。
    这些伟大的工程是根据我们伟大的领袖和导师斯大林的计划而进行的。斯大林共产主义建设工程，其规模之雄伟，使我们欢欣鼓舞，它巩固着光荣的苏维埃祖国的强大，并使我们更加接近共产主义。这些伟大的工程就是苏联人民从事和平建设劳动的最好证据。我们需要和平，因为我们要建筑新的房屋、学校、水电站和运河，我们要播种谷物，我们要在草原上造林，我们要以共产主义的精神来培养和教育我们的年青的一代。所以，我们毫不吝惜自己的力量来维护和平事业。全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志就是维护和平事业的第一名战士。
    我衷心地希望伟大的中苏两国人民的不朽友谊加强和发展起来，为了全世界的和平，也为了自由中国的繁荣。
