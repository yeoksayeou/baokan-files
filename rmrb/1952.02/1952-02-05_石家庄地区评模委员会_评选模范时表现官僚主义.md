    Shijiazhuang Region Model Worker Appraisal Committee
    Displays Bureaucracy in Selecting Model Workers
    Editor: On October 22, 1951, a reader of the People's Daily criticized the Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company for errors in the calculation standards for commissioned fabric weaving. I believe this criticism is very correct. This company had similar incidents before. Therefore, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce inspected the company's work, and the company's manager also made a review in the "Shijiazhuang Daily."
    However, what is strange is that in the selection of model workers last year, the Shijiazhuang Region Model Worker Appraisal Committee actually selected Zhao Qingchun, the manager of this company, as a "Third-Class Model Worker." What kind of "model" is this? What positive role can such a model play in the work? I think this kind of "reward" can only encourage the irresponsible work style of the company's leading cadres.

    Editor: The Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company made errors in the calculation standards for commissioned fabric weaving last year, causing losses to state property. However, the Shijiazhuang Region Model Worker Appraisal Committee rated the company's manager and the company as model workers and a model unit. I think this is very inappropriate.
    I don't know what conditions the Shijiazhuang Region Model Worker Appraisal Committee based on to select him as a model worker? What did they base the selection of this company as a model unit on? A Staff Member

### 石家庄地区评模委员会  评选模范时表现官僚主义

    石家庄地区评模委员会  
    评选模范时表现官僚主义
    编辑同志：一九五一年十月二十二日人民日报读者对石家庄花纱布分公司委托厂商织布计算标准发生错误一事提出批评，我认为这一批评是非常正确的。这个公司在以前发生过类似的事情，因此，石家庄市工商行政部门曾检查过这个公司的工作，公司的经理也曾在“石家庄日报”上作过检讨。
    但令人奇怪的是，在去年评选模范时，石家庄地区评模委员会竟把这个公司的经理赵庆春同志评选为“三等模范”。这种所谓“模范”从何说起？这种模范对工作能起什么积极作用？我认为这种“奖励”实际上只能助长这个公司领导干部的不负责任作风。　柳冈勃
    编辑同志：石家庄花纱布分公司在去年委托厂商织布时，计算标准发生错误，造成国家财产损失。但石家庄地区评模委员会却评这个公司的经理和公司为模范和模范单位，我认为这是很不应当的。
    我不知道石家庄地区评模委员会究竟根据什么条件评选他为模范？根据什么评选这个公司为模范单位？  一职工
