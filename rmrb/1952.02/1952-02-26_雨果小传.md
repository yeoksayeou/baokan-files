    A Short Biography of Victor Hugo
    Editor's Note: Today is the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great French writer Victor Hugo. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, issued a letter to the people of all countries on the 19th of this month, calling on the people of all nations to unite and commemorate the world cultural giants Victor Hugo, Gogol, da Vinci, and Avicenna. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Victor Hugo's birth, we have translated a short biography of Hugo from the Soviet Small Encyclopedia and published it here.
    Victor Hugo (1802-1885) was a famous French Romantic poet, the son of one of Napoleon's generals. He entered the literary world very early with poems and critical essays. He founded "La Muse Française," the first journal of French Romanticism. Hugo was initially a royalist, but gradually transformed. His changing political views reflected the ideological changes of a large part of the French petty bourgeoisie. These people formerly opposed the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty, accepted the constitutional monarchy of Philippe, but then abandoned it, subsequently sympathized with Napoleonism, and finally enthusiastically welcomed the Revolution of 1848. During the revolution, Hugo stood in a wavering position, but later firmly opposed the aggressive policies of the adventurer Napoleon III. When forced into exile, Hugo lived on the island of Jersey and later moved to Guernsey, returning to his homeland only after the overthrow of the Second Empire. Hugo witnessed the destruction of his country and the bloody suppression of the Paris Commune. He vehemently opposed the cession of Alsace and Lorraine, and defended those convicted for participating in the Paris Commune, thus incurring the hatred of the bourgeoisie. His funeral (1885) was a celebration of the poet and democratic social activist.
    Hugo's fame is associated not only with the rich poetic legacy he left behind but also with his liberal and humanitarian beliefs. Throughout his life, he engaged in the struggle against the death penalty and advocated for permanent peace and a European federation. Hugo was a versatile writer, whose works included lyric poetry, satire, epic poetry, drama, novels, and political essays. Hugo's lyric poetry ("Orientalia," "Autumn Leaves," "Songs of Twilight," etc.) not only intimately expresses poetic melodies but also vividly reflects social life issues (the struggle for political and national freedom, the striving for harmony among nations, etc.). Hugo's poetic creation reached its peak during his years of exile. "Les Châtiments" (1853) is a book of solemn satirical poems full of anger and sorrow; this book is against the despicable and hateful usurper (Napoleon III). The collection of lyric poems "Les Contemplations" (1856) is a work of philosophical reflection. The long lyric epic "La Légende des Siècles" is a symbolic picture of human development, "humanity rising from darkness to ideals." His last poem, "The Death of the Devil" (unfinished), is a summary of "La Légende des Siècles."
    Although drama occupies a large place in Hugo's literary creation, his achievements in this area only retain historical significance. The preface to "Cromwell" (1827) is a declaration of the Romantic struggle against pseudo-classicism; the first performance of "Hernani" (1830) was a struggle against convention-bound literati, followed by plays such as "Le Roi s'amuse," "Lucrèce Borgia," and "Ruy Blas."
    In Hugo's creations, the novel occupies a more important place. The historical novel "Notre-Dame de Paris" (1831) is a vivid picture of the late Middle Ages. The novel "Les Misérables" (1864) depicts the exciting life of Paris in the first decade of the 19th century. "Les Travailleurs de la Mer" describes the struggle against the forces of nature. "L'Homme qui rit" describes human cruelty and aristocratic arrogance. In his last novel, "Quatrevingt-treize" (1873), Hugo depicts the civil war during the French Revolution.
    Hugo made many contributions to liberating and enriching the French poetic language. His vocabulary is astonishingly rich. Hugo's favorite style is contrast, antithesis, and metaphor. This gives his language extraordinary relief and expressiveness. Although Hugo's language sometimes inevitably falls into exaggeration, his rich imagination and power still make him one of the greatest poets of the nineteenth century.

    雨果小传
    编者按：今天是法国伟大作家雨果的一百五十周年诞辰。世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在本月十九日发表了告世界各国人民书，要求全世界各民族人民联合起来，纪念世界文化巨匠雨果、果戈里、芬奇、阿维森纳。在纪念雨果一百五十周年诞辰的今天，我们特从苏联小百科全书中节译了雨果的小传，发表在这里。
    维克多·雨果（一八零二—一八八五年）是著名的法国浪漫派诗人，是拿破仑的一位将军的儿子。他很早就以诗和批评论文步入了文坛。他创立了法国浪漫主义第一个机关刊物 “法兰西诗神”。雨果最初是一个王政主义者，后来逐渐转变。他的政治观点的转变，反映出一大部分法国小资产阶级的思想变化。这些人过去反对布尔邦王朝的复辟，接受了腓力普的君主政体，但是又离弃了它，随后又对拿破仑主义表示同情，最后则热烈地迎接了一八四八年的革命。在革命时期，雨果站在动摇的地位，但是后来则坚决反对冒险家拿破仑第三的侵略政策。雨果在被迫逃亡时，住在翟尔赛岛，后来迁居盖纳赛，直到第二帝国颠覆后才回到祖国。雨果看到了祖国的破坏和对巴黎公社的血腥镇压，他激烈地反对割让亚尔萨斯和洛林两省，同时保卫为参加巴黎公社而被判罪的人，因而招致了资产阶级对他的憎恨。他的殡葬（一八八五年）是诗人兼民主主义的社会活动家的礼赞。
    雨果所享的盛名，不仅和他所遗留下的丰富的诗的遗产相联系，而且还与他的自由主义和博爱主义的信念相联系着。他一生从事反对死刑的斗争，拥护永久和平和欧洲联邦。雨果是多方面的作家，他的作品包括有抒情诗、讽刺诗、史诗、戏剧、小说和政论等。雨果的抒情诗（“东方集”，“秋叶集”，“心声集”等）不仅亲切地表达了诗的曲调，而且生动地反映出社会生活问题。（争取政治和民族自由的斗争，争取各民族的和睦等。）雨果的诗创作，在他被放逐的年代达到了高峰。“惩罚集”（一八五三年）是一本充满愤怒和悲痛的严正的讽刺诗歌；这本书是反对可鄙可恨的篡夺者（拿破仑第三）的。抒情诗集“静观集”（一八五六年）是一部哲学深思的作品。长篇抒情史诗“诸世纪传说”是人类发展、“人类由昏暗上升到理想”的一幅象征图画。他临终前所写的一首诗“魔鬼之死”（未完成），是“诸世纪传说”的一个总结。
    虽然雨果的文学创作中，戏剧占有大量地位，但是他在这方面的成就只保存着历史意义。“克伦威尔”（一八二七年）的序言，是浪漫派与伪古典主义斗争的宣言；“欧那尼”的初次上演（一八三○年），是与墨守成规的文人的斗争，随后则有“国王取乐”、“绿依·伯拉”和“中世纪武士”等剧作。
    在雨果的创作中，小说占着更重要的地位，历史小说“巴黎圣母院”（一八三一年）是中世纪后期的鲜明图画，长篇小说“悲惨世界”（一八六四年）描写了巴黎十九世纪前十年的激动的生活。在“海上劳工”中则描写了与自然力的斗争。在“笑着的人”中描写了人类的残酷和贵族的傲慢。在他最后的一部小说“九十三年”（一八七三年）中，雨果描绘出法国革命时代的内战情景。
    雨果对于解放和丰富法国的诗歌语言，有许多贡献。他的词汇以丰富惊人。雨果所喜爱的文体是对比、对照和隐喻。这赋予了他的语言非凡的浮雕性和表现性。雨果的语言虽然有时不免失于夸大，但是他的想像的丰富和力量仍使他成为十九世纪最伟大的诗人之一。（君强节译自苏联小百科全书）（附图片）
