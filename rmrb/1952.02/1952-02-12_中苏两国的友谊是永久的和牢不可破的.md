    The Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union is Permanent and Unbreakable
    Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    On this great day two years ago – the day the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed – the people of China and the Soviet Union solemnly announced to the world: our two great nations, with a combined population of 700 million, are united as one! We are marching forward in unison for the great cause of defending world peace and developing human civilization. This move aroused cheers from righteous people all over the world and sent shivers down the spines of the imperialist warmongers.
    At that time, I was coming out of the enemy's camp, on my way to embrace the motherland. Upon hearing this epoch-making news, I was overjoyed; the ideal I had dreamed of for years had finally come true! Facing the vast ocean, I recalled 1946, when the War of Resistance Against Japan had just ended, and the Kuomintang bandit gang was still ruling over large swathes of land, pursuing an anti-Soviet policy. Despite this, the Soviet Union spared no effort in assisting the Chinese people. During my visit to the Soviet Union at that time, I met many Soviet scientists, all of whom expressed their willingness to work for Sino-Soviet cultural exchange. However, this wish could not be realized under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. I witnessed the brilliant achievements of various Soviet constructions, which made me realize that the only path for China was to "learn from Russia." To express my wishes, I requested Academician Vinogradov to find a way to print the Chinese inscription on the book I sent to the Soviet Union in 1940, and he generously agreed. These were the words "Respectfully wishing eternal and firm Sino-Soviet relations." At that time, it was just a wish, but it came true in just four years! This made me deeply feel that the water of the vast Pacific Ocean cannot compare to the source of wisdom of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong; the clear and bright sky cannot compare to the brightness and greatness of their hearts.
    Through this treaty, the brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union is fixed! The people of the two countries have established a combat friendship as allies on the front line of preventing imperialist aggression and ensuring world peace and security. And jointly undertake the lofty and glorious task of "developing and consolidating economic and cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union" on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Soviet Union has always been a good friend of China. Since the success of the October Revolution, it has always extended friendly and kind hands to the Chinese people. But the hateful Chiang Kai-shek gang hindered us. Under their brutal rule, they not only blinded our eyes, forbidding us to see the Soviet Union, and blocked our ears, forbidding us to listen to the Soviet Union, but also labeled "pro-Soviet" as a crime to persecute those who upheld justice. Thanks to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the reactionaries were driven out of mainland China, and the remnant Chiang Kai-shek gang, like a flickering candle, is only huddled in Taiwan under the protection of US imperialism. Therefore, there is today – a new era in which the Chinese and Soviet people can embrace each other to their heart's content and unite freely.
    Looking at the other side, the US imperialists are still resolutely hostile to the Chinese people, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek gang abandoned by the Chinese people in Taiwan; militarily threatening our borders in Korea and repeatedly bombing our Northeast; directing the remnant army of the Chiang Kai-shek gang on the Sino-Myanmar border, attempting to disrupt our southwest border; and recently forced the reactionary Japanese Yoshida government to conclude a so-called "peace treaty" with the remnant Kuomintang reactionary group. These facts prove that the US imperialists are baring their fangs and claws to provoke us, and are deploying bridgeheads to attack our country in all directions. Of course, the Chinese people are not afraid of these. On the one hand, because of our experience, we have defeated the invading army of Japanese imperialism and the eight million Chiang Kai-shek troops; on the other hand, we are not isolated, we have a reliable friend – the Soviet Union; the people's democratic forces led by the Soviet Union are unprecedentedly vast and strong.
    Facts have proved that US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, the mortal enemy of the Asian people, and the mortal enemy of the people of the world. It is the creator of poverty and the instigator of war. It symbolizes death. At the same time, the Chinese people are more aware that the Soviet Union is our good friend, a good friend who helps us carry out the peaceful construction of our great motherland, and also a pioneer for us to enter socialist and communist society. It is also a true friend of the working people of the world and a bastion of world peace. She symbolizes new life.
    We Chinese people love our leader Chairman Mao, we compare him to the sun; at the same time, we also love Marshal Stalin from the bottom of our hearts, because he is the mentor of progressive people all over the world. Their light shines eternally and immortally, day and night, on the whole world. Stalin – Mao Zedong, Moscow – Beijing have become our common songs, and this song resounds throughout the world, symbolizing the permanent and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

### 中苏两国的友谊是永久的和牢不可破的

    中苏两国的友谊是永久的和牢不可破的
    中国科学院数学研究所所长  华罗庚
    在两年前的这一伟大的日子里——中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的日子里，中苏两国的人民庄严地昭告了全世界：我们七万万人口的两个大国已经牢不可破地团结在一起了！我们共同一致地为了保卫世界和平，为了发展人类文明的伟大工作而齐步前进。这一举措，引起了全世界正义的人们的欢呼，也引起了帝国主义战争贩子们的战栗。
    那时我正从敌人的阵营中出来，在投向祖国怀抱的路途上，一听到这个有时代意义的消息，不禁欣喜欲狂；若干年来梦寐求之的理想竟实现了！面对着浩瀚的洋水使我回忆到一九四六年，那时抗日战争胜利不久，国民党匪帮还统治着大片国土，正在推行着反苏政策。尽管如此，苏联对中国人民的援助，还是不遗余力的。在我那次的苏联访问中，见到了不少苏联科学工作者，他们无例外的都表示愿为中苏文化交流而努力，然而这愿望在国民党匪帮统治之下是无法做到的。我眼看到苏联各种建设的辉煌成就，使我意识到中国唯一的道路是“以俄为师”。为了表示我的心愿，我请求维诺格拉陀夫院士把我一九四○年寄到苏联的书上的中文题字设法印出，他慷慨地答应了。这就是“谨以此书祝中苏邦交永笃”几个字。那时仅是一种愿望，但短短的四年竟实现了！使我深深地感觉到，浩瀚的太平洋的水，怎比得上斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席的智慧源泉；明畅的万里晴空，怎比得他们胸怀的光明伟大。
    通过了这一条约，中苏两国兄弟般的友谊固定了！两国人民在防止帝国主义侵略的战线上，在确保世界和平与安全的战线上建立了同盟军的战斗友谊。并且共同地担负起在平等互利原则下“发展和巩固中苏两国间的经济与文化关系”的崇高而光荣的任务。苏联一向是中国的好朋友，十月革命成功以来，一直地向中国人民伸出友谊的亲善的双手。但可恶的蒋匪帮却阻挠我们。在它们的残暴统治下，不但蒙住了我们的眼睛，不许我们看苏联，堵上了我们的耳朵，不许我们听苏联，并且把“亲苏”定为是罪名，来迫害主持正义的人们。感谢中国人民革命的伟大胜利，反动派被赶出了中国大陆，残余的釜底游魂的蒋匪帮仅朝不保暮地局促于美帝国主义所庇护的台湾。因之才有了今日——中苏人民能够尽情地拥抱，自由自在地团结在一起的新时代。
    再看另一方面，美帝国主义者还在坚决地和中国人民为敌，在台湾支持中国人民所唾弃的蒋匪帮；在朝鲜军事上威胁我们的边疆，并且屡次地空袭我东北；在中缅边境指挥着蒋匪帮的残余军队，企图搅乱我们的西南边境；最近更迫使日本吉田反动政府和国民党反动残余集团缔结所谓“和约”。这种种的事实，证明了美帝国主义者正在张牙舞爪地向我们挑衅，在我们的四面八方布置进攻我国的桥头阵地。当然中国人民是不畏惧这些的，一方面由于我们的经验，我们曾打败过日本帝国主义的侵略军和八百万蒋匪军，另一方面我们并不孤立，我们有可靠的友人——苏联；以苏联为首的人民民主力量，正空前无比的广大而强壮。
    事实证明：美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，是亚洲人民的死敌，是全世界人民的死敌。它是贫困的制造者，战争的挑拨者。它象征着死亡。同时中国人民更认识到，苏联是我们的好朋友，帮助我们进行伟大祖国的和平建设的好朋友，同时也是我们进入社会主义和共产主义社会的先驱者。它还是全世界劳动人民的真正友人，世界和平的堡垒。她象征着新生。
    我们中国人民热爱我们的领袖毛主席，我们把他比做太阳；同时，我们也从心底里热爱着斯大林大元帅，因为他是全世界进步人民的导师。他们的光芒，永恒地，不朽地，无分昼夜地照耀着全世界。斯大林——毛泽东，莫斯科——北京成为我们普遍的歌声，这歌声响彻世界，象征着中苏间永久的和牢不可破的友谊。
