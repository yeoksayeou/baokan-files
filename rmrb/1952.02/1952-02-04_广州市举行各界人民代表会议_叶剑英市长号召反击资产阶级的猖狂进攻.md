    Guangzhou Holds People's Representatives Conference; Mayor Ye Jianying Calls for Repelling the Bourgeoisie's Frenzied Attacks
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Fourth Guangzhou Municipal People's Representatives Conference, Third Session, was held on January 31st. The conference adopted resolutions to continue deepening the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and to launch a movement in the industrial and commercial sectors against bribery, tax evasion, fraud, and theft. This is the signal for the city's people to fight back against the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks.
    Guangzhou Mayor Ye Jianying delivered a report at the meeting, in which he pointed out: The national bourgeoisie of Guangdong has a more pronounced semi-colonial and semi-feudal character than in other cities, maintaining myriad connections with imperialism and feudalism. Therefore, those illegal industrialists and businessmen are more cunning and rampant than in other places. Their bad ideas and bad habits, like a plague, are invading and corrupting revolutionary cadres. They use sugar-coated bullets of sensual pleasures and material benefits to lure and attack revolutionary cadres. As a result, weak-willed individuals like Ren Haishan and Lin Ke, managers of the Provincial Department Store, fell into their traps, unable to extricate themselves, becoming their prisoners. In the past two years, illegal industrialists and businessmen have used various ingenious methods to evade taxes, with over 35,800 cases uncovered. When accepting state-entrusted processing, orders, or construction projects, they cut corners and sought exorbitant profits. For example, in the auditorium built by the South China Military Region, 60 percent of the steel reinforcement did not meet specifications. Some illegal merchants even secretly transported strategic materials to aid the enemy. For example, in the autumn of 1950, the traitorous merchant Zeng Qitao shipped over 270,000 kilograms of tin for export. Since the bourgeoisie's attacks have developed to such a frenzied degree, the people's government and all patriotic people must resolutely rise up to give the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks a powerful counterattack, and gradually reduce and isolate the bourgeoisie's ugly thoughts and their influence, to ensure the leadership of the working class in politics and the leadership of the state economy in the economy. Only in this way can we sweep away the obstacles to the construction of New Democracy and create favorable conditions for entering socialism in the future.
    After explaining that the People's Government will adopt a policy of differentiated treatment, combining education and punishment for illegal industrialists and businessmen, Ye Jianying warned illegal industrialists and businessmen that they should be honest and sincere, confess their mistakes, and seek the forgiveness of the people. He also called on all workers, shop assistants, and all working people in the city to actively expose all bribery, tax evasion, fraud, and theft by illegal industrialists and businessmen, or to persuade them to voluntarily confess. At the same time, he called on patriotic industrialists and businessmen to actively expose the illegal acts of treacherous merchants.
    Finally, on behalf of the Municipal People's Government, Ye Jianying announced: (1) People of all strata have the right to report and expose all illegal activities of illegal industrialists and businessmen, and the People's Government fully guarantees the safety of the lives and property of those who report. Those who are reported, if they engage in retaliatory acts such as murder, threats, or coercion, will be severely suppressed. (2) Given that in the past, illegal merchants often used petty favors to buy off shop assistants, workers, and staff (such as "extra dividends," "red shares," "extra subsidies," etc.) to facilitate their illegal acts such as bribery, tax evasion, fraud, and theft, and used them to carry out the above-mentioned illegal activities, as long as shop assistants, workers, and staff actively report the illegal activities of illegal merchants and clearly explain their own problems, the government will not pursue or punish them in any way. (3) The government guarantees the right to work of shop assistants, workers, and staff who bravely participate in reporting. If an enterprise being reported is penalized and temporarily closes down, the government will introduce shop assistants, workers, and staff within the enterprise to work.
    (4) All those who privately announce the closure of business or disguised closure of business, lay off or disguised lay off, causing shop assistants, workers, and staff to lose their jobs, will be regarded as illegal acts, and all such acts will be invalid. After the shop assistants, workers, and staff resume work, wages will be paid as usual. All travel expenses, wages, severance pay, and resettlement fees that have already been paid shall not be recovered, nor shall they be deducted on any pretext or in a disguised manner.
    After listening to the report, all the representatives immediately conducted group discussions and plenary discussions. The representatives unanimously agreed with the report and expressed their firm support and participation in this struggle.

    广州市举行各界人民代表会议  
    叶剑英市长号召反击资产阶级的猖狂进攻
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：广州市第四届第三次各界人民代表会议在一月三十一日举行。会议通过了继续深入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和在工商界中开展反行贿、反偷漏、反欺诈、反盗窃运动的决议。这是全市人民反击资产阶级猖狂进攻的斗争信号。
    广州市市长叶剑英在会上作报告，他指出：广东的民族资产阶级的半殖民地半封建色彩比之其他城市的更为浓厚，和帝国主义、封建主义保持着千丝万缕的联系，因而那些不法的工商业者较之其他地方更加狡猾和猖獗，他们的坏思想、坏习气像瘟疫一样侵袭和腐蚀革命干部，他们用声色货利的糖衣裹着的炮弹，来勾引进攻革命干部。结果像省百货公司经理任海山、林克那样意志薄弱的人，就堕入圈套，不能自拔，成了他们的俘虏。两年多来，不法的工商业家用种种巧妙的方法，偷税漏税，经查出的案件达三万五千八百多宗。承受国家委托加工、定货或修建工程时，偷工减料，贪图暴利。如华南军区建筑的礼堂，有百分之六十的钢骨是不合规格的。甚至竟有不法商人盗运战略物资以资敌国，如一九五零年秋奸商曾其滔运锡出口，前后达二十七万公斤以上。资产阶级的进攻既已发展到这样猖狂的程度，人民政权和一切爱国人民就必须坚决起来，给资产阶级的猖狂进攻以强有力的反击，并使资产阶级这种丑恶思想及其影响逐渐缩小和被孤立起来，以保证政治上工人阶级的领导和经济上国家经济的领导。只有这样，才能扫掉新民主主义建设的障碍，为将来进入社会主义创造有利条件。
    叶剑英在说明人民政府对待不法的工商业者将采取有区别地对待、教育和惩办相结合的方针后，正告不法工商业者应该忠诚老实，坦白悔过，来取得人民的宽恕；并号召全市工人、店员和一切劳动人民积极检举不法工商业者一切行贿、偷漏、欺诈、盗窃行为，或规劝他们主动坦白。同时号召爱国的工商业家积极检举奸商不法行为。
    叶剑英最后代表市人民政府宣布：（一）各阶层人民有检举揭发不法工商业者一切非法行为的权利，人民政府完全保障检举人生命财产的安全。被检举人如有谋害、威胁、要挟等等报复行为，必将受到严厉镇压。（二）鉴于过去不法商人为了便于达到自己行贿、偷漏、欺诈、盗窃等非法行为的目的，常以小恩小惠收买店员、工人、职员（如“多分红利”、“入红股”、“额外津贴”等等），利用他们进行上述不法行为，因此，只要店员、工人、职员积极检举不法商人的非法行为，交代清楚自己的问题，政府不加以任何追究与处分。（三）勇敢参加检举的店员、工人、职员，政府保障他们的工作权，如被检举的企业因受处罚而有个别停业者，政府将介绍该企业内的店员、工人、职员以工作。
    （四）凡私自宣布歇业或变相歇业，解雇或变相解雇，致令店员、工人、职员失业者，视作非法行为，一律无效，店员、工人、职员复业后，工资照发，凡已付出之路费、工资、解雇金、遣散费等，一律不得收回，亦不得借故或变相扣除。
    全体代表在听取报告后，即进行分组讨论和大会讨论。代表们一致同意这个报告，并表示坚决拥护和参加这个斗争。
