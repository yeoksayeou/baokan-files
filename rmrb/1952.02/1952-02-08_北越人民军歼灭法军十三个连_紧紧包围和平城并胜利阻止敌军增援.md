Xinhua News Agency, 7th. According to Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese People's Army has annihilated another thirteen battalions of French invading forces on the thirty-kilometer-long front between Hoa Binh City, the capital of Hoa Binh Province southwest of Hanoi, and Xuan Mai.

At the beginning of January this year, after smashing the enemy's defense line in the Black River area, the People's Army liberated the entire Ba Vi mountain area west of Hanoi and then advanced south to surround Hoa Binh City, the capital of Hoa Binh Province, occupied by the French army, and cut off Highway 6 (Hanoi-Hoa Binh Highway). The French Command quickly ordered the remaining French troops to advance south from the Black River front and pieced together fourteen battalions, trying to use these forces to desperately break through Highway 6 and finally lift the siege of Hoa Binh City by the Vietnamese People's Army.

The enemy reinforcements cautiously advanced under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire from January 10th. The enemy used a paratrooper regiment as the vanguard, followed by the French 1st Mobile Group, which was considered the most elite unit of the French army in North Vietnam. But they were immediately intercepted by the Vietnamese People's Army. It was not until the 16th that the enemy reached Ao Trach. Then they continued to advance west along the five-kilometer section of highway between Ao Trach and Dong Ben, but continued to be attacked. On the 18th, two battalions and thirty-two trucks of enemy troops advancing towards Mi Bridge were attacked by the People's Army. One enemy company was annihilated, and the remaining enemies fled back to Ao Trach in panic. A few days later, after reorganization and after aircraft dropped napalm bombs and fired thousands of shells at Mi Bridge, the enemy reinforcements planned to advance again. But on the 23rd and 24th, they were ambushed twice at Mi Bridge, losing more than three companies, and had to retreat to Ao Trach again.

The enemy's paratrooper units were finally unable to continue advancing towards Hoa Binh City. On the 29th, the entire French 1st Mobile Group and other affiliated battalions tried to open a way to rescue the paratrooper units. But they were intercepted by the People's Army at Mi Bridge and lost four platoons. The next night, the People's Army attacked a height near the "Broman Bridge" held by the French army, annihilating one French company.

On Highway 6 alone, the People's Army has killed and captured about thirteen enemy companies, shot down nine enemy planes, and successfully prevented the enemy reinforcements from breaking through Highway 6. To date, Hoa Binh City is still under tight siege by the People's Army.

    北越人民军歼灭法军十三个连
    紧紧包围和平城并胜利阻止敌军增援
    【新华社七日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军在河内西南的和平省省会和平城与春梅之间的长达三十公里的战线上，又歼灭法国侵略军十三个连。
    今年一月初，人民军在粉碎了黑水江一带的敌军防线以后，又解放了河内以西的整个巴为山地区，随即南进包围了法军占领的和平省省会和平城，并切断了第六号公路（河内—和平公路）。法军司令部赶快命令法军残余部队从黑水江战线南进，并且拼凑了十四个营，想用这些兵力拼命打通第六号公路，最后解除越南人民军对和平城的包围。
    敌军援兵从一月十日起小心翼翼地在飞机大炮掩护下前进。敌军以伞兵一团作为前锋，被认为法军在北越的最精锐部队的法军第一机动团跟随前进。但他们立刻遭受到越南人民军的截击。直到十六日，敌军才到达奥泽。接着他们又顺着奥泽与同滨之间五公里的一段公路继续向西前进，但又继续挨打。十八日，向米桥前进的敌军两个营和三十二辆卡车遭人民军攻击，敌军一个连被歼灭，残敌惊慌地逃回奥泽。几天以后，敌军援兵经过重新整顿，并以飞机向米桥投下凝固汽油弹、发射数千发炮弹以后，又打算前进。但在二十三日和二十四日，他们在米桥受到两次伏击，损失了三个连以上的军队，又不得不退回奥泽。
    敌军的伞兵部队终于无法继续向和平城前进了。二十九日，法军第一机动团全部和其他附属的各营都想打开一条出路，来援救伞兵部队。但他们在米桥被人民军截击，损失了四个排。第二天夜里，人民军又攻击“布罗曼桥”附近法军据守的一处高地，歼灭法军一个连。
    仅在第六号公路上，人民军就已经击毙和俘掳了敌军约十三个连，击落敌机九架，并胜利地阻止了敌军援兵打通第六号公路的企图。迄今为止，和平城仍在人民军的紧紧包围中。
