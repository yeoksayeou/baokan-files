    Comrade Cheng Teqing of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army writes to report the situation of being harmed by unscrupulous merchants.
    Editor:
    In mid-May of last year, we were fighting on the front lines in Korea. At that time, we were constantly attacking the enemy, so the food supply was quite difficult, and we often went for ten to twenty days without oil, salt, or vegetables. Sometimes we dug up some wild vegetables to cook and eat. In order to annihilate the evil American and Li bandit troops, we put forward slogans such as "Everything is for victory, overcome difficulties, and we will win." At that time, we received a batch of canned fish and meat from the motherland. I put the cans in my food bag and carried them on my shoulder, walking nearly two hundred miles of mountain roads for three or four consecutive days, preferring to eat plain rice rather than eat them. At noon on May 26 last year, when the enemy's artillery fire was rumbling nearby and planes were constantly circling and strafing in the sky, and our troops were about to move, I thought, now is the time to open the cans and have a full meal so that we can complete our mission. However, when I opened the cans, I saw that they were full of small fish, the thickness of a finger, cooked only with boiled water and a few slices of ginger. When I ate them, they had a fishy, foul-smelling, and unpalatable taste. When I turned it over to the bottom, I found a few pieces of rotten leaves. I wanted to throw it away immediately, but then I thought that it had been sent to us from the motherland after a long journey, overcoming countless difficulties, so I carried it for several more days. Finally, after hesitating for a long time, I resolutely threw it away. I still ate my rice without vegetables. At that time, I thought: Why did the people of the motherland put small fish that were all bones in the cans? And why didn't they add some oil and salt? Finally, I thought that our motherland had just started construction, and the technology might not be good, and the cans had lost their seal and gone bad. At that time, in the tense war environment, and because of my infinite love for the people of the motherland, I thought: Let's just forget about it.
    Recently, after seeing the shocking news in the newspapers that unscrupulous merchants were using rotten meat, horse meat, and rotten egg water to make canned food, and using rotten cotton to make first-aid kits, I realized that these were the poisonous hands of unscrupulous merchants against us. Do they still have humanity? I resolutely demand that the government and the people thoroughly expose these unscrupulous merchants, who are frantic and even more poisonous than snakes and scorpions, and punish them most severely.

    志愿军某部程特青同志来信
    报告他们遭受奸商暗害的情形
    编辑同志：去年五月中旬，我们在朝鲜前线作战。当时我们辗转对敌进攻，所以饮食供应相当困难，经常一二十天吃不到油、盐、菜蔬。我们有时挖些野菜来煮着吃。为了歼灭万恶的美、李匪军，我们提出了“一切为着胜利、克服困难，我们就能获得胜利”等口号。当时，我们曾领到一批祖国的鱼、肉罐头。我把罐头装在干粮袋中，背在肩上，连续三、四日，走过近二百里的山路，宁吃白饭也舍不得把它吃掉。在去年五月二十六日中午，当敌人的炮火正在近处轰鸣，飞机不断地在天空盘旋扫射，我们部队正要行动时，我想，这时候应该打开罐头，饱餐一顿，好去完成任务。但是，打开罐头时，却见里面都是手指粗细，只用白水加几片姜煮的小鱼，一吃是一股腥臭难咽的恶味。再往底下一翻，翻出了几片腐朽的树叶。我想立刻把它抛掉，但又想，这是从祖国经过遥远的道路，克服无数的困难才送到我们手中的，于是我又把它背了好几天。最后，我犹疑了好久，才决然把它抛弃了。我仍然吃我那没有菜蔬的米饭。当时，我想：祖国人民为什么把全是骨头的小鱼装在罐头里？并且又不放些油、盐？最后我想，我们祖国刚开始建设不久，可能技术不好，罐头是走了气坏了的。当时在紧张的战争环境里，加以我对祖国人民无限敬爱，所以想：还是忘掉这回事吧。
    最近看到报上登载着奸商们用臭肉、马肉、臭蛋水等做罐头，用烂棉花做救急包的惊人消息，我才知道这是奸商对我们下的毒手。他们还有人性吗？我坚决要求政府和人民，把这些丧心病狂，简直比蛇蝎还毒的奸商彻底检举出来，最严厉地惩办他们。
