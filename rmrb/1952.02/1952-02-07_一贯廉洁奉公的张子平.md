Zhang Ziping, the county magistrate of Jingxian County, Hebei Province, joined the Communist Party of China in 1933. For nearly twenty years, he has maintained an excellent style of hard work, plain living, honesty, and dedication to public service. The masses say, "County Magistrate Zhang is a good county magistrate who loves the motherland and the people."

Zhang Ziping is infinitely loyal to the people's cause. During the flood season last year, Zhang Ziping worked with the river management laborers on the river embankment for more than two months, greatly encouraging their enthusiasm and completing the river management project ahead of schedule. One project on the Second Village Dike was originally planned to be completed by two hundred people in three days, but it was finished in less than a day. During the two months of flood prevention work, Zhang Ziping was so overworked that he fainted on the dike. Later, the rain caused his diseased leg to swell, but he never complained of fatigue and continued to insist on working. Zhang Zhixi, the secretary of the Jingxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, learned about this and tried to persuade him to return to the office for recuperation.

Zhang Ziping cherishes state property very much. He often educates others and encourages himself by saying, "Every grain of rice is exchanged for by the people's blood and sweat and should be cherished." In fact, Zhang Ziping acts accordingly: In the spring, he urges warehouse managers to inspect and repair warehouses. During the rainy season, he calls various warehouses to inform the personnel in charge of warehouses to carefully check the storage facilities to prevent rainwater from entering and rotting the grain. In addition, Zhang Ziping often takes the time to inspect the warehouses. Last year, he conducted a general inspection of all the warehouses in the county, with some warehouses being inspected three or four times. Therefore, grain spoilage has never occurred in Jingxian County warehouses. At the same time, Zhang Ziping also struggled against phenomena that did not cherish state property. Once, Zhang Ziping went to Longhua to inspect the work and saw cadres from the grain company spilling grain and not cleaning it up. Zhang Ziping suggested that they sweep it up. At that time, some cadres were unhappy and said, "You're really nosy (meaning that Zhang Ziping shouldn't be concerned, because the grain company is directly under the leadership of the higher-level grain company). With so much grain, can we not waste a little?" Zhang Ziping immediately criticized them, saying, "No matter how much grain there is, we can't waste a single grain. Don't think that wasting a little grain doesn't matter. Let's think about it, some of the people in the disaster areas of Jingxian County now have one meal but not the next!" These words made those cadres ashamed, and they picked up dustpans and brooms to sweep up the grain on the ground. Sun Ruiting, who worked in the logistics headquarters, once said, "I used to be quite lazy, but County Magistrate Zhang motivated me."

Many cadres in Jingxian County often say, "In County Magistrate Zhang's eyes, there is nothing that cannot be used." This statement is indeed true. For example, in the past, waste paper from the Jingxian County People's Government was thrown around everywhere. Last spring, Zhang Ziping called on all cadres to accumulate waste paper. In one year, more than two hundred catties were accumulated. At two thousand yuan per catty, this could increase income by more than four hundred thousand yuan. Now, the chair he sits on in the office was once discarded as waste. He picked it up, nailed it with nails, wrapped it with wire, and has used it for more than a year.

Zhang Ziping is very concerned about the lives of the masses and shares weal and woe with them. When Zhang Ziping goes to work in the villages, he eats what the farmers eat. He politely refuses when some farmers want to make something delicious for him. When he goes to work in disaster areas, he eats cornmeal cakes with wild vegetables with the disaster victims. Some disaster victims feel bad about this and want to cook for him separately, but he refuses. Because Zhang Ziping can live with the masses, when he goes to a village, the men, women, old, and young surround him, asking about everything. The masses always affectionately call him "our county magistrate."

In addition, Zhang Ziping always solicits the opinions of the masses and helps them solve various difficulties. Last spring, labor model Wang Litian wrote to him, requesting the government to allocate some superior cotton seeds, and also requested the government to allow them to send people to the county to learn production techniques. Zhang Ziping immediately replied and allocated him two hundred catties of superior cotton seeds. In April, when the county opened an agricultural technology training class, Zhang Ziping wrote a letter to notify Wang Litian to send people to participate in the training. Another labor model, Ma Shuying, said: "County Magistrate Zhang always thinks of the masses. Under the leadership of County Magistrate Zhang, we will definitely do a good job in production and increase wealth for the country. When electing the county magistrate again, I will still vote for him."

Zhang Ziping originally enjoyed the treatment of the middle kitchen, but when he thought of the hardship of the masses in the disaster area, he automatically lowered his living standards and donated the surplus grain to relieve the disaster victims. In 1950, he donated more than two hundred catties of millet at one time.

Zhang Ziping loves labor and grows his own vegetables every year. Last year, he harvested more than one hundred catties of radishes alone. His work and labor deeply moved the cadres and the masses.

    一贯廉洁奉公的张子平
    李树增
    河北省景县县长张子平，一九三三年加入中国共产党。近二十年来，一直保持着艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公的优良作风。群众说：“张县长是爱祖国爱人民的好县长。”
    张子平对人民事业是无限忠诚的。去年防汛的时候，张子平和治河民工一起在河堤上工作了两个多月，大大地鼓舞了治河民工的工作热情，提前完成了治河工程。第二村大堤的一项工程，原计划二百个人、三天完成，结果不到一天的时间就完成了。两个多月的防汛工作，张子平劳累过度，曾昏倒在堤上；以后，雨水又淋得他带病的腿浮肿起来，但他从来没有说过累，仍继续坚持工作。中共景县县委书记张?西知道后，才设法叫他回机关去休养。
    张子平十分爱护国家的财产。他经常这样教育别人和勉励自己：“每一粒米，都是老百姓用血汗换来的，应该爱护。”事实上，张子平也是这样作的：春天，他督促仓库管理人员检查、修理仓库。雨季，他给各仓库打电话，告诉管理仓库的人员，要切实检查库房，防止雨水浸入，霉烂粮食。此外，张子平还常常抽时间去检查仓库。去年，他对全县的仓库普遍检查了一次，有的仓库检查了三四次。因此景县仓库从来没有发生过霉烂粮食的事情。同时张子平和不爱护国家资财的现象进行了斗争。有一次，张子平到龙华去检查工作，看到粮食公司的干部撒了粮食不收拾，张子平就建议他们扫起来。当时有些干部不高兴地说：“你管得真宽（意思是说张子平不该管，因粮食公司直属上级粮食公司领导）。粮食多了，还能不蹧蹋一点吗？”张子平立刻向他们提出批评说：“不管多少粮食，也不能蹧蹋一粒。不要觉得蹧蹋一点粮食算不了什么，咱们想想，现在景县灾区的老百姓，有的吃了上顿就没有下顿呢！”这一番话，说得那些干部惭愧得拿起簸箕、扫帚，把地上的粮食扫了起来。在后勤指挥部工作的孙瑞亭曾这样说：“我过去挺懒，可是张县长把我带动起来了。”
    景县许多干部常说：“张县长的眼里没有不能用的东西。”这句话是确确实实的。比如过去景县人民政府的废纸到处乱扔。去年春天，张子平号召全体干部积存废纸。一年工夫，就积存了二百多斤。按二千元一斤计算，就可增加收入四十多万元。现在他办公坐着的一张椅子，是过去当作废物扔到一边的，他拣起来，用钉子钉了钉，用铁丝缠了缠，又用了一年多。
    张子平非常关心群众的生活，和群众同甘共苦。张子平下村工作时，农民吃什么，他就吃什么。有些农民要给他作点好吃的，他都是加以婉言谢绝。他到灾区工作，就和灾民一起吃糠菜团子。有的灾民过意不去，要给他另作饭，他都谢绝了。因为张子平能够和群众生活在一起，所以他走到那村，那村的男女老少就围着他，问长问短。群众总是用“咱们的县长”来亲切地称呼他。
    此外，张子平还时时刻刻征询群众意见，帮助群众解决各种困难。去年春天劳动模范王立田给他写信，要求政府拨给一些优良棉种，还要求政府允许他们派人到县里学习生产技术。张子平立即答复拨给他二百斤优良棉种。四月份县里开办农业技术训练班时，张子平又写信通知王立田派人来参加学习。另一个劳动模范马书英说：“张县长处处为群众着想，咱们在张县长的领导下，一定能搞好生产，为国家增加财富。再选举县长时，我还要投票选举他。”
    张子平本来是享受中灶待遇的，但当他想到灾区群众生活困苦，便自动降低了自己的生活水平，把节余下来的粮食，捐出来救济灾民。一九五○年，他一次就捐了二百多斤小米。
    张子平喜爱劳动，每年自己种菜，去年光萝卜就收了一百多斤。他的工作和劳动，深深感动了干部，感动了群众。
