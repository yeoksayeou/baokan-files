The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is the most systematic application of advanced Soviet experience in the construction of a railway in our country. It was built well, quickly, and economically.

Since the start of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, people often saw Soviet experts working diligently on the construction site. They often, immediately after getting off the plane or stepping out of the car or train, without rest, ran to the construction site. Among them were those who drilled into culverts to check for water accumulation, those who took small hammers and climbed onto bridges to inspect them, and those who stayed up late into the night studying blueprints with Chinese engineers... They always decided how to help everyone flexibly apply advanced Soviet experience to the site based on practical investigation and research.

Soviet experts have provided assistance to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in many ways. They used a series of advanced Soviet experiences to solve problems in projects ranging from the construction of roadbeds, bridges, tunnels, and track laying to post-opening road maintenance. Therefore, railway workers often say that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is one of the crystallizations of friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

The People's Government demanded that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway be built very solidly, and Soviet experts designed and constructed it according to this principle. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway line is mostly composed of weathered rock. It would not be very strong to build the roadbed using general filling methods, and at least a year would be needed to allow the roadbed to naturally sink during the rainy season before tracks could be laid and the railway opened. Soviet expert Zagangdayev suggested using the "layered filling and tamping method" (tamping every three centimeters of soil as a layer). Roadbeds constructed in this way are very stable and can be used for track laying and opening to traffic immediately. There is particularly heavy rainfall in the Sichuan Basin. Soviet expert Sirin proposed the warning that "water is the enemy of the railway" and tried to prevent water damage. Because of his suggestion, waterproof layers were added to tunnels and bridges (except iron bridges), the diameter of culverts was doubled compared to the old culvert standards, and the side ditches on both sides of the roadbed were also deepened.

Soviet experts paid special attention to economy based on the principles of Soviet economic construction. The Southwest lacks steel materials, and it would be very difficult to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway entirely with steel bridges. Soviet expert Sirin carefully studied the advantages of China's stone arch bridges, believing that they were both economical and relatively strong. He advocated promoting the strengths of our country's inherent architecture and making small bridges into stone arch bridges as much as possible. The facts after the opening of the railway prove that the stone arch bridges have not affected driving safety at all. The Soviet experts' concept of thrift can also be seen in the following incident: When erecting the largest Tuojiang iron bridge on the entire line, Soviet expert Tikhonov discovered that Chinese engineers were using I-beams to pad under the steel beams to drag the steel beams onto the bridge piers. He immediately stopped them, saying, "The I-beams will bend when pressed, and they have to be imported from abroad. Engineers should save money for the country everywhere." At first, the stubborn engineers did not accept his opinion. As a result, the I-beams were indeed bent and the steel beams still could not be dragged up. At this time, they finally accepted the Soviet experience wholeheartedly and changed to another method.

With the specific help of Soviet experts, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is the cheapest railway built in Chinese railway history. Engineers once compared it with the Beijing-Hankou Railway. The average total project number per kilometer of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is seven times greater than that of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, but the average construction cost per kilometer is only equal to five times that of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Engineer Zhang Dayong, who participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway before liberation, said: "The Kuomintang only completed 15 percent of the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, and we only need to use the same project cost as building this 15 percent to complete the entire line. This is the result achieved by using socialist construction experience. If we eradicate corruption and waste, we will save even more."

Because of the help of Soviet experts, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has also become one of the fastest-built railways in China. In just one and a half years from the start of construction to the present, the entire line's 30 million cubic meters of roadbed earth and stone work have been basically completed. More than 300 kilometers of tracks have been laid. The project is progressing at an average speed of 20 kilometers per month, which is twice as fast as the construction of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and up to 24 times faster than the Nanxun Railway.

    苏联专家和成渝铁路
    新华社记者  程在华  刘挥琛
    成渝铁路是我国最系统地运用苏联先进经验修筑的一条铁路，它修筑得又好又快又节约。
    自修筑成渝铁路开工以来，人们时常看见苏联专家在工地上辛勤工作。他们常常在刚下飞机或者是刚从汽车和火车上走下来，就毫不休息，立刻跑到工地上去。他们之中有钻到涵洞里去查看积水的，有拿了小鎯头爬到桥下去检验的，有熬更守夜和中国工程师研究图样的……他们总是从实际调查研究中来决定怎样帮助大家把苏联先进经验灵活地运用到现场去。
    苏联专家们对成渝铁路的帮助是多方面的。他们用一系列的苏联先进经验来解决从修筑路基、架桥、开隧道、铺轨一直到通车后的养路等工程中的问题。因此，铁路职工常说成渝铁路是中苏两国友谊的结晶品之一。
    人民政府要求把成渝铁路修筑得非常坚固，苏联专家们就根据这个原则，进行设计和施工。成渝铁路沿线多风化石，按一般填土方法来修筑路基是很不坚实的，并且至少要在一年后，让路基在雨季中自然下沉了才能铺轨通车。苏联专家扎刚达耶夫就建议采用“分层填土打夯法”（每填三公寸土就打夯一次作为一层），这样筑成的路基很稳固，又可以立刻铺轨通车。四川盆地雨水特别多，苏联专家西林就提出“水是铁路的敌人”的警语，设法防水。因为他的建议，隧道、桥梁（铁桥除外）都加铺了防水层，涵洞的口径比旧的涵洞标准放大了一倍，路基两旁的边沟也加深了。
    苏联专家根据苏联经济建设的原则，特别注意节约。西南缺乏钢料，如果成渝铁路完全架设钢桥是很困难的。苏联专家西林细心研究了中国石砌拱桥的优点，认为既节约又比较坚固，就主张发扬我国固有建筑的长处，把小桥尽量作成石拱桥。通车后的事实证明，石拱桥一点没有影响到行车安全。苏联专家的节约观念还可以从下面这件事情上面表现出来：在架设全线最大的沱江大铁桥时，苏联专家吉赫诺夫发现中国工程师用工字铁垫在钢梁下面拖拉钢梁上桥墩，他立刻制止说：“工字铁一压就会弯曲，而且要从外国进口，工程师应该处处为国家节约。”开始，固执的工程师不接受他的意见，结果工字铁真的被压弯了而钢梁仍旧拖不上去，这时他们终于心悦诚服地接受了苏联的经验，改用了别的办法。
    在苏联专家的具体帮助下，成渝铁路是中国铁路史上修筑得最便宜的一条铁路。工程师们曾把它和京汉铁路比较，成渝铁路每公里平均工程总数要比京汉铁路大七倍，但每公里平均修筑费用却只等于京汉铁路的五倍。解放前曾参加过修筑成渝铁路的工程师张大镛说：“国民党只做了成渝铁路全线工程的百分之十五，而我们只要用和修这百分之十五相等的工程费用就可以把全线修通，这是利用社会主义建设经验所达到的成果。假如我们根绝贪污浪费的话，还会节约得更多。”
    因为苏联专家的帮助，成渝铁路也成为中国铁路中修得最快的铁路之一。从开工到现在仅一年半的时间，全线三千万方路基土石方工程已基本完成。路轨已铺了三百余公里。工程进行速度平均每月二十公里，比沪宁路的修筑快两倍，比南浔路快到二十四倍。
