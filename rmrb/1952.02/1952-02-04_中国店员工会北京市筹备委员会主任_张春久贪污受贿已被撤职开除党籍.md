The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Store Employees Union in Beijing convened a meeting of member representatives on January 25th to discuss the embezzlement and bribery of Zhang Chunjiu, the director of the committee, and his actions in helping unscrupulous merchants steal state property for exorbitant profits. The meeting decided to give Zhang Chunjiu the punishment of dismissal and reflection. The National Committee of the Chinese Store Employees Union, with the consent of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, removed Zhang Chunjiu from his position as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Store Employees Union. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to expel him from the Party.

Zhang Chunjiu joined the revolutionary work in 1938 and joined the Party in the same year. He had certain achievements in rural work in the past. He entered Beijing in January 1949 and led the work of the store employees union under the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. After entering the big city, Zhang Chunjiu could not resist the temptation of illegal merchants and lost the stand of the working class. Zhang Chunjiu was won over by the unscrupulous merchant Yu Zihe through the relationship of hometown friendship, and he was close to Yu, without distinction between each other. In order to help Yu Zihe steal state assets, he wrote a deceptive letter of proof to the state-owned trust trading house in 1949, falsely claiming that the unscrupulous merchant Yu Zihe was the "person in charge of the village mass cooperative" and a "Communist Party member." Later, he also helped Yu Zihe raise more than 7 million yuan among his fellow villagers (capitalists); and called on store employees union cadres and workers to invest, saying that "investing can make a fortune." He also used his authority to introduce Yu Zihe to the bank through union cadres to obtain loans; and entrusted Ruifuxiang Silk Fabric Store to guarantee Yu, and to exchange 200 million yuan with the bank, so that Yu Zihe could steal state assets and seek exorbitant profits. Zhang Chunjiu once arbitrarily instructed Gao Fu, chairman of the Beijing Oil, Salt, Grain, and Workers Union, to lend 25 million yuan of union funds (including a portion of membership fees) to Yu Zihe for speculation and profiteering. Zhang Chunjiu himself accepted bribes amounting to bicycles, watches, pens, clothes, etc. In addition, he often accepted "treats" from merchants and borrowed pocket money from merchants. In this way, under Zhang Chunjiu's "help," Yu Zihe changed from a merchant with very little capital to a big merchant with 700 million yuan of capital.

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Zhang Chunjiu still tried to deceive the organization and refused to confess his problems; at the same time, he personally approached Yu Zihe and other cadres who had jointly embezzled to secretly make an "offensive and defensive alliance." Only after being reported by the masses did he reluctantly admit his embezzlement and bribery.

    张春久贪污受贿已被撤职开除党籍
    中国店员工会北京市筹备委员会一月二十五日召开会员代表大会，讨论委员会主任张春久贪污受贿、帮助奸商盗窃国家财产谋取暴利的行为。大会决定给张春久以撤职反省的处分。中国店员工会全国委员会并取得中华全国总工会的同意，撤销张春久中国店员工会全国委员会副主席的职务。中共北京市委员会已决定开除他的党籍。
    张春久一九三八年参加革命工作，同年入党，过去在农村工作中曾有一定的成绩。一九四九年一月进入北京，在市总工会领导店员工会工作。张春久进入大城市后，经不起不法商人的引诱，丧失了工人阶级的立场。张春久被奸商于子和用同乡友谊关系拉拢，和于往来密切，不分彼此。他为了帮助于子和盗窃国家资财，在一九四九年给国营信托商行写欺骗性的证明信，冒称奸商于子和为“村群众合作社负责人”、“共产党员”。以后，他又帮助于子和在同乡（资本家）中招股七百多万元；并号召店员工会干部和工人群众入股，说“入股可以发财”，他更利用职权，通过工会干部介绍于子和到银行取得贷款；又托瑞蚨祥绸布店给于作保，向银行押汇二亿元，使于子和得以盗骗国家资财，谋取暴利。张春久曾擅自主使北京油盐粮工会主席高福把二千五百万元工会经费（包括一部分会费），借给于子和投机倒把。张春久本人前后受贿计有自行车、手表、钢笔、衣服等。此外，他又经常接受商人“请客”，向商人借零用钱。于子和就这样在张春久“帮助”下，由一个资本很小的商人，变成拥有七亿元资本的大商人。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，张春久仍图蒙混组织，拒不交代自己的问题；同时又亲自找于子和及其他共同贪污过的干部，密订“攻守同盟”。后经群众检举，他才吞吞吐吐地承认自己的贪污受贿行为。
