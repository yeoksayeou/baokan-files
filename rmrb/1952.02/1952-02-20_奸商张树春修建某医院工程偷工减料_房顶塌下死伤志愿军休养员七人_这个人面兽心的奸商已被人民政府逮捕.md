    Profiteer Zhang Shuchun Skimps on Materials in Hospital Construction
    Roof Collapses, Killing and Injuring Seven Volunteer Army Veterans
    This Bestial Profiteer Has Been Arrested by the People's Government
    The profiteer Zhang Shuchun of Zhang Tongxing Construction Factory in a certain place in Jiangsu, corrupted cadres and skimped on materials when he contracted to repair a rear hospital in a certain place last year, stealing a large amount of state wealth. Less than two months after the houses were built, part of them collapsed, killing one Volunteer Army veteran recuperating there and injuring six others. This incident fully exposed the towering crimes of unscrupulous capitalists who harm others to benefit themselves and endanger the people.
    During the enemy and puppet period, the profiteer Zhang Shuchun relied on reactionary forces to engage in speculation and profiteering and made a fortune. Twenty years ago, he was a small businessman running a tile and carpentry workshop, but now he has become a large capitalist owning dozens of houses and running a construction factory, a woodworking shop, a sauce garden, a salt shop, and a hotel. After liberation, he pretended to be active and stole the positions of chairman of the local woodworking industry association and member of the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    In July 1951, when the local people welcomed the wounded and sick Volunteer soldiers to recuperate there with utmost gratitude, the profiteer Zhang Shuchun learned from Kong Mingsheng, the chief of the management section of a certain rear hospital and a corrupt element, that the hospital buildings were to be fully repaired. Zhang Shuchun believed that an opportunity to make a fortune had arrived. He put on a "patriotic" face and said: "The Volunteer Army is different from others. I will be responsible for repairing the house to their satisfaction." At the same time, he bribed Kong Mingsheng. As a result, the repair project of a certain rear hospital was contracted to Zhang Shuchun without any bidding at all. When signing the contract, he took advantage of the fact that the cadres were laymen. Originally, repairing a roof ridge only required a little labor, but he claimed fourteen times the labor; he overcharged by more than six hundred feet of glass. It was agreed that when repairing the houses, the roof tiles should be repaired row by row, missing tiles should be added, and broken rafters and battens should be replaced. The houses should be repaired to be airtight and waterproof, and the contract also stipulated "one year warranty against leaks." However, when repairing, the tiles were not repaired row by row, but only the visible leaks were patched up. Originally, repairing one roof required seven or eight workers, but he only used a few workers to patch up the leaks in dozens of houses. Where tiles were missing, he would take some from the roof ridge or other thicker roofs; if it was really not enough, he would bring some tiles himself to patch up. The surface tiles were patched up, but many of the rafters and battens underneath were broken and not replaced. The walls that should have been repaired were not repaired either, but the dust was wiped off and a layer of whitewash was applied. Kong Mingsheng saw that the whitewash had not dried yet, and some walls were already cracked, and some bricks were still exposed, so he asked Zhang Shuchun. Zhang Shuchun said: "You don't understand, it will be fine when it dries!" Kong Mingsheng took his money and let it go. The supervising administrator, Wang Jifu, was also bribed with three million yuan and bought over. Therefore, he became even more daring in stealing. In this project, he stole more than 20,000 tiles alone.
    Because this conscienceless profiteer skimped on materials in this way, after the completion of the project, when the Volunteer Army veterans moved in, the houses leaked everywhere when it rained; water also flowed out of the walls. The veterans moved around but couldn't find a dry place. The situation was very serious, and the hospital called him. At first, he would send a tile and carpenter to repair it a bit to perfunctorily deal with it; later, he simply refused to meet. At 3:00 a.m. on August 30th last year, just as the veterans were sound asleep, there was a "crash," and an entire room collapsed, and the beams and pillars pressed down. The seven Volunteer Army veterans sleeping inside were all crushed underneath. Li Rongkao was smashed to pieces and died on the spot. Zhang Fenglin, Zhang Chunqin, Tang Qiaowang, Zhao Xishan, Wang Zijing, and Wang Guotai were all injured. Two of them fainted on the spot. Look! Unscrupulous businessmen who harm others to benefit themselves and are driven by profit treat the Volunteer Army veterans - the most honorable people who are wounded in their days and nights protecting the interests of the people of the motherland and world peace - in this way!
    Comrade Li Rongkao was a glorious Communist Party member who joined the Party in 1948. He had rendered meritorious service to the people of the motherland and was wounded protecting the people of the motherland. He was not killed by American imperialism, but he was killed by the profiteer Zhang Shuchun! Several Volunteer Army soldiers, after being shot by American imperialists, were given even more serious injuries by the profiteer.
    After this incident, the leading cadres of this hospital, because of their bureaucratic work style, did not promptly investigate the responsibility, allowing the profiteer Zhang Shuchun to escape responsibility by chance. What's even more infuriating is that after the Volunteer Army veterans were crushed to death and injured, the profiteer Zhang Shuchun even took out another 3.5 million yuan to bribe Kong Mingsheng, asking him to rebuild the house in order to restore his "reputation." Our "most beloved people" were crushed to death and injured, but this profiteer didn't care about it at all. What he cared about was his "reputation" for defrauding money! In fact, he didn't want to restore any "reputation" at all, but just wanted to make another fortune in the reconstruction project. In the reconstruction project, in addition to trying every means to skimp on materials, the workers saw him steal three large fir timbers, more than 10,000 tiles, and more than 200 dan of lime. In total, in the project of repairing a certain rear hospital, according to preliminary statistics, he stole and defrauded state property of more than 30 million yuan. But this stubborn and dishonest cunning man still refuses to admit his guilt in the face of human and material evidence. This bestial profiteer has been arrested and brought to justice by the government.

    奸商张树春修建某医院工程偷工减料
    房顶塌下死伤志愿军休养员七人
    这个人面兽心的奸商已被人民政府逮捕
    江苏某地张同兴营造厂奸商张树春，在去年包修某地一座后方医院时，腐蚀干部，偷工减料，大量盗窃国家财富。房屋修建后不到两月，就有部分倒塌，砸死在这里休养的志愿军休养员一人，砸伤六人。这一事件，充分地暴露了不法资本家损人利己、为害人民的滔天罪行。
    奸商张树春，在敌伪时期，依靠反动势力，投机倒把，发了横财。二十年前他是个开瓦木作坊的小商人，现在却成了拥有房屋几十间、开设有营造厂、木器店、酱园、盐店、酒店的大资本家。解放后他伪装积极，窃取了当地木器业同业公会主任委员、工商业联合会筹备委员会委员的职务。
    一九五一年七月，当地人民抱着万分感激的心情，欢迎志愿军伤病员到那里休养时，奸商张树春从某后方医院管理股股长、贪污分子孔明生口中，得到要全面整修医院房屋的消息。张树春认为发财的机会到了。他摆出一副“爱国”面孔说：“志愿军不比旁人，我负责把房修得满意。”同时，他便向孔明生行贿。这样，某后方医院的整修工程根本没有开标，就被张树春包去了。在订合同时，他欺负干部是外行。本来修一个屋脊只要一个多工，他开了十四个工；他把玻璃多开了六百多尺。讲好修理房屋时，房面的瓦要逐行修理，瓦少了要添，椽子、行条坏的要换，房子要修得不透风、不漏雨，合同上也明文规定“包一年不漏”。可是修的时候，瓦没按行整修，只是拣着看得见的漏洞修补一下。本来整修一间屋面就需要七、八个工，而他只用几个工就补了几十间屋的漏洞。瓦少的地方，就到屋脊或别的瓦厚的屋上去抽些来；实在不够，自己才带些瓦去补。表面上的瓦是补起来了，可是瓦下面的椽子、行条有很多坏的、断的，都没给换。墙上应补的也不补，把灰掸一掸，刷上一层石灰水就算了。孔明生看到石灰水还没干，有的墙已经裂缝，有的砖还露在外面，就去问张树春。张树春说：“你不懂，干了自然就行了！”孔明生因为拿了他的钱，也就马虎过去了。监工的管理员王吉富，也被他送了三百万元，收买过去了。因此，他就更胆大妄为地进行偷盗。在这个工程中，只是瓦就被他偷走两万多块。
    由于这个丧尽天良的奸商这样偷工减料，完工后，志愿军休养员住进去，一下雨，房子就到处漏雨；墙里也往外流水。休养员搬来搬去也找不到干燥地方。情况非常严重，院方打电话找他。最初他还派个瓦木工去修补一下，敷衍敷衍；后来就干脆不见面了。在去年八月三十日早三时，正当休养员熟睡的时候，“哗啦”一声，有一间房整个倒塌，梁柱压下来。睡在里面的七个志愿军休养员，全被压在下面。李荣考当时被砸得血肉模糊而死。张凤林、张纯琴、唐桥旺、赵喜山、王子敬、王国泰全被砸伤。其中有两人当场昏了过去。看吧！损人利己、唯利是图的不法商人就是这样对待日日夜夜为了保护祖国人民利益和世界和平而光荣负伤的人——中国人民志愿军休养员的！
    李荣考同志是一个光荣的共产党员，是一九四八年入党的。他曾为祖国人民立过功，又为保护祖国人民而负了伤。他没有被美帝国主义所杀害，却被奸商张树春杀死了！几个志愿军战士们被美帝国主义者射伤之后，又被奸商添加了更沉重的伤。
    这一事件发生后，这个医院的领导干部因为有着官僚主义作风，没有及时追究责任，竟使奸商张树春侥幸逃脱责任。这还不算，更使人气愤的，是奸商张树春在志愿军休养员被砸死、砸伤以后，竟又拿出三百五十万元来贿赂孔明生，要求重修房子，以挽回他的“信誉”。我们“最可爱的人”被砸死砸伤了，这个奸商并不放在心上，他关心的却只是他骗钱的“信誉”！其实他又何尝是想挽回什么“信誉”，不过是想在重修房屋的工程中再捞一把。在重修工程中，张树春除千方百计偷工外，单工人看见的，就又偷窃了三根大方杉木料，一万多块瓦和二百多担石灰。总计在整修某后方医院的工程中，据初步统计，他就盗骗国家财产三千多万元。但这个死不坦白的刁诈之徒，在人证物证面前，还坚不认罪。这个人面兽心的奸商已被政府逮捕法办。
