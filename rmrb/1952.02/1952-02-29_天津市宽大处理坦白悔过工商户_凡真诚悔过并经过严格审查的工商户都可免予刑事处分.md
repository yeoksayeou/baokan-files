    Xinhua News Agency Report: Tianjin Municipality Broadly Deals with Industrial and Commercial Households Who Confess and Repent. All Industrial and Commercial Households Who Sincerely Repent and Pass Strict Review Can Be Exempted from Criminal Punishment.
    [This Newspaper Report] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Tianjin Municipal Austerity Inspection Committee is currently processing a large number of illegal industrial and commercial households who have confessed and repented. Before the processing, the Tianjin Municipal Austerity Inspection Committee distributed the "Conclusion Report Form for the Anti-Bribery, Anti-Tax Evasion, Anti-Theft of State Property, Anti-Inferior Workmanship and Use of Substandard Materials, and Anti-Theft of National Economic Intelligence Movement" to the relevant industrial and commercial households through the district sub-committees to fill out. The form is divided into five items: bribery, tax evasion, etc., and has three columns for the opinions of the industry review group (composed of industrial and commercial households and the inspection team, or the capitalist study group and the inspection team), the review and examination opinions of the primary trade union, and the review and processing opinions of the district austerity inspection sub-committee. All illegal industrial and commercial households who sincerely repent, seriously fill out the conclusion report form, and pass the above three levels of review and are approved by the Municipal Austerity Inspection Committee can be exempted from criminal punishment. The Ninth District Austerity Inspection Sub-Committee recently convened a processing conference for key industries such as machine casting and hardware smelting. At the meeting, a lenient treatment was announced for 256 illegal industrial and commercial operators who had a relatively honest attitude, made a relatively thorough confession, or whose crimes were relatively minor during the movement. Other district austerity inspection sub-committees mostly adopted the method of holding conclusion announcement conferences by industry; for some small industries with a small number of households, meetings were held according to the jurisdiction of the public security police station for processing.
    Mobilizing industrial and commercial households to seriously fill out this conclusion report form, and conducting fair reviews and strict examinations, is the key to doing a good job in processing. At the same time as distributing the forms, the austerity inspection sub-committees in each district convened meetings of illegal industrial and commercial operators by district or industry, and once again explained the people's government's policy of curing diseases and saving people and the policy of combining leniency with strictness. Therefore, after the forms were issued, most industrial and commercial operators were able to confess frankly, and the review groups were also able to conduct serious reviews. During the review by the primary trade unions, workers and shop assistants carefully reviewed the conclusion report forms filled out by the capitalists. They not only pointed out the items that the capitalists had omitted, prompting the capitalists to fill in truthfully, but also further strengthened their sense of being masters of their own affairs through the review work.
    Generally, illegal industrial and commercial operators are very moved after receiving lenient treatment from the people's government, and have expressed that they will repay the government's leniency with actions of actively participating in denunciations and doing a good job in production. For example, Zhang Zhihuai, manager of the private Zhenya Iron Factory in the Ninth District, and Li Jinduo, manager of Zhengda Mingji Materialware Factory, defrauded state property of more than 600 to 700 million yuan, but because they confessed thoroughly and were determined to repent, they were given lenient treatment. They were deeply moved and took the lead in asking to speak at the processing conference, expressing their gratitude to the people's government for saving them, and that they were determined to sincerely obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy in the future, rely on the workers to do a good job in production, and make up for their past sins.

    天津市宽大处理坦白悔过工商户
    凡真诚悔过并经过严格审查的工商户都可免予刑事处分
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：天津市节约检查委员会正对大批坦白悔过的违法工商业户进行处理。处理前，天津市节约检查委员会通过各区分会将“反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动结论报告表”分发给有关工商业户填写。表内分行贿、偷税漏税等五项，并有行业评议组（由工商业户及检查组组成，或由资本家学习小组及检查组组成）、基层工会的评议审查意见及区节约检查分会的审查、处理意见等三栏。凡是真诚悔过，认真填写结论报告表，又经过以上三重审查通过经市节约检查委员会批准的违法工商业户，都可免予刑事处分。第九区节约检查分会日前曾召开了机器铸铁、五金熔炼等重点行业的处理大会。会上对二百五十六户在运动中态度比较老实，坦白比较彻底或罪情较轻的不法工商业者宣布宽大处理。其他各区的节约检查分会也大多采用了按行业召开处理大会宣布结论的办法；对某些户数不多的小行业便按公安派出所辖区召开会议进行处理。
    动员工商业户认真填写这一结论报告表，并进行公正的评议和严格的审查，是做好处理工作的关键。在分发表格的同时，各区节约检查分会都以区或以行业为单位召开了违法工商业者会议，再次交代了人民政府所采取的治病救人的方针和宽大与严办相结合的政策。所以发下表格后，一般工商业者都能坦白填写，同时评议组也能认真评议。基层工会审查时，工人、店员对资方所填写的结论报告表审查得很仔细，他们不但指出了资方漏报事项，促使资方按实填报，并且通过审查工作进一步加强主人翁的思想。
    一般违法工商业者获得人民政府宽大处理以后很受感动，都表示今后要以积极参加检举和搞好生产的行动来报答政府的宽大。如九区私营振亚铁工厂经理张治怀和正大明记料器厂经理李金铎，盗骗国家资财都在六、七亿元以上，但因坦白彻底，决心悔过，因此都得到宽大处理。他们深为感动，在处理大会上争先要求讲话，表示感谢人民政府对他们的挽救，今后决定真诚地服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，依靠工人搞好生产，以抵补过去的罪过。
