    Central South Region Mobilizes Farmers to Build Water Conservancy Projects and Promote Soil and Water Conservation
    The Central South region is mobilizing farmers to build water conservancy projects and promote soil and water conservation. Farmers in Hunan and Guangdong provinces, responding to the call of the People's Government, have enthusiastically launched a campaign of one small water conservancy project per village. Farmers in the hilly areas of the Dabie Mountains in Hubei Province are actively building ponds and dams. According to incomplete statistics from Huanggang Special District in Hubei Province, farmers have built more than 7,000 small water conservancy projects. The winter repair project on the Jianghan main embankment in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has been completed, with 68 percent of the total earthwork plan finished.
    In the Lishui and Weishui river basins of Hunan Province, farmers are building large-scale water source forests. The broad masses of farmers, model workers, Communist Party members, and Youth League members in Dayong, Yongshun, Sangzhi, Shimen, Li County, Cili, Linli, Ningxiang and other counties have been mobilized to participate in seed collection, sowing, and tree planting. According to incomplete statistics from Li County alone, the afforestation area had reached more than 15,000 mu by last November. In addition, farmers along Dongting Lake are carrying out a willow planting project to protect the embankments, with an estimated 30 million reeds and willows to be planted. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南发动农民兴修水利推行水土保持工作
    中南区各地正在发动农民兴修水利和推行水土保持工作。湖南省和广东省农民响应人民政府的号召，已热烈开展了一村一小型水利工程的运动。湖北省大别山区丘陵地带的农民，正积极地修建塘坝，据湖北省黄冈专区的不完全统计，农民兴修的小型水利工程已达七千多处。长江中游江汉干堤的冬修工程已告结束，完成了土方总计划百分之六十八。
    在湖南省澧水和沩水流域，农民们正在大规模地营造水源林。大庸、永顺、桑植、石门、澧县、慈利、临澧、宁乡等县的广大农民、劳动模范、共产党员、青年团员都已动员起来，参加了采种、播种和植树的工作。仅据澧县不完全的统计：到去年十一月止，造林面积已达一万五千多亩。另外，洞庭湖沿岸的农民，正在开展植柳护堤的运动，预计将植芦堤柳三千万株。（新华社）
