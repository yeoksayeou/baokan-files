    The Superiority of the 1951 Weaving Method is Displayed
    ——Qingdao No. 8 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory Fully Promotes the 1951 Weaving Method
    The Qingdao No. 8 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory has fully promoted the 1951 weaving method. The Qingdao Municipal 1951 Weaving Method Promotion Group overcame the ideological concerns of the factory's leading cadres about "affecting the central task" and the conservative thinking of some workers, enabling the promotion work to proceed relatively smoothly. From mid-December of last year to January 10th of this year, 95% of the weaving workshop workers learned the 1951 weaving method, of which 60% were already proficient. Workshop management personnel, Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres all grasped the spirit of the method. After applying the 1951 weaving method to production, each department achieved significant results. The overall rate of substandard cloth decreased by 69.8% (from 6.55% to 1.93%); 25% of the workers have eliminated substandard cloth, and 50% of the workers have reduced the substandard cloth rate to below 1%. Production efficiency increased by an average of 2.12%, meaning each person produces an average of one more yard of cloth per day, with some individuals producing two more yards. The machine operating rate increased by 3.1%. Workers' ability to manage machines has also improved. Worker Wang Xiuying looked after 16 machines before learning the 1951 weaving method, with a substandard cloth rate of 2%; now she looks after 20 machines and has not produced any substandard cloth for eight consecutive nights. Auxiliary workers applying the spirit of the 1951 weaving method when dismantling damaged cloth reduced the waste from re-weaving and basically eliminated dismantling marks. Maintenance workers can proactively patrol and inspect machines, promptly repairing any problems they find. Based on current levels, promoting the 1951 weaving method can increase production and save 8.5 billion yuan annually. After learning the 1951 weaving method, workers grasped the patterns of patrol, and generally felt the work was easier. In the past, some female workers complained about the maintenance workers, spinning workers, and sizing workers because the work was difficult; now this phenomenon no longer exists. In the past, some people couldn't sleep because of the high rate of substandard cloth. Now workers feel that the work has a pattern and is not as "erratic" as before.
    The reason why this factory was able to promote the 1951 weaving method relatively smoothly was mainly because it overcame various ideological obstacles and made good preparations. The factory's promotion work was carried out in an organized and step-by-step manner under the leadership of the Qingdao Municipal 1951 Weaving Method Promotion Group. Initially, although a advanced working method promotion committee was formed by the main leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and various workshops, the leading cadres did not pay much attention to the promotion work, fearing that it would hinder the central task (increasing production and practicing economy). After the promotion group's explanation, they realized that promoting the 1951 weaving method not only did not hinder increasing production and practicing economy, but was the main way to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and they actively led the promotion work. The conservative thinking of some workers (especially older workers) was the main obstacle to the promotion work. Some workers said, "The 1951 weaving method is nothing special. The machines in Tianjin are good and can handle 32 machines, but we can't do that here." Some workers said, "Those who studied in Tianjin are all outstanding workers from across the country. How many such workers are there?" Some workers emphasized objective reasons, believing that the high rate of substandard cloth was due to poorly repaired machines and frequent yarn breakage, and that the 1951 weaving method could not improve quality and output at all. In order to overcome the conservative thinking of the workers, the promotion committee adopted two methods: First, the leading cadres strengthened patriotic education for the employees, explaining the political and economic significance of promoting the 1951 weaving method, so that the workers understood the benefits of the 1951 weaving method and consciously requested to learn it. Second, the promotion was carried out with a focus, first by running training classes, on the one hand, to cultivate a large number of "little teachers" to serve as the backbone of the overall promotion; on the other hand, to educate those workers who did not believe in the superiority of the 1951 weaving method with facts. This method played a great role in overcoming conservative thinking. For example, some old workers, when they heard about the benefits of using the 1951 weaving method, said, "That's nonsense," "blowing hot air." But after they saw the achievements of those workers who were originally not as good as them in production learning in the training class, they were truly convinced and actively requested to learn.
    In addition, before fully promoting the 1951 weaving method, this factory also did a lot of technical preparation work - improving technical management, such as in the past it took an average of 55 minutes to change a warp beam; now, it only takes 22 to 27 minutes. This reduces the difficulty of the promotion work. (Ding Wen)

    一九五一织布工作法的优越性显示出来了
    ——国营青岛第八棉纺织厂全面推广了一九五一织布工作法
    国营青岛第八棉纺织厂全面推广了一九五一织布工作法。青岛市一九五一织布工作法推广组克服了这个厂的领导干部“怕影响中心任务”的思想和某些工人的保守思想，使推广工作进行得比较顺利。从去年十二月中旬起，到今年一月十日止，百分之九十五的织布间工人学会了一九五一织布工作法，其中有百分之六十的工人已经精通了，车间管理人员，党、行政、工会、青年团的干部都掌握了工作法精神。运用一九五一织布工作法进行生产以后，各部门工作都有了显著的成果。全场次布率降低了百分之六九·八（从百分之六·五五降到百分之一·九三）；百分之二十五的工人已消灭了次布，百分之五十的工人已把次布率降低到百分之一以下。生产效率平均提高了百分之二·一二，即每人每天平均多生产一码布，个别的人多生产了二码。机器运转率提高了百分之三·一。工人的看车能力也提高了。工人王秀英在学习一九五一织布工作法前看十六台车，次布率是百分之二；现在她看二十台车，连续八夜没出次布。帮接工人运用一九五一织布工作法精神拆坏布，减少了回织的浪费，基本上消灭了拆痕。保全工人能主动地巡回检查机器，发现毛病就及时修理。以现在的水平计算，推广一九五一织布工作法，全年可以增产节约八十五亿元。工人们学习了一九五一织布工作法后，掌握了巡回规律，普遍地觉得工作轻松了。过去，有的女工因活不好做而埋怨保全工人、细纱工人和浆纱工人，现在没有这种现象了；过去，有的人因为次布出得多了睡不着觉。现在工人都感到工作有规律，不像以前那样“一松一紧”了。
    这个厂所以能比较顺利地推广一九五一织布工作法，主要是因为克服了各种思想障碍和做好了准备工作。这个厂的推广工作，是在青岛市一九五一织布工作法推广组的领导下，有组织有步骤地进行的。开始时，虽然由党、行政、工会、青年团、各车间的主要领导干部和优秀工人组成了先进工作法推广委员会，但领导干部是不很重视推广工作的，他们怕这会妨碍中心工作（增产节约）。经过推广组的解释，他们认识了推广一九五一织布工作法不仅不妨碍增产节约，而且是完成增产节约任务的主要办法，就积极地领导推广工作了。某些工人（特别是老年工人）的保守思想是推广工作的主要障碍。有的工人说：“一九五一织布工作法没有什么特别的地方，天津的车好，能看三十二台，我们这里办不到。”有的工人说：“在天津学习的都是全国的优秀工人，这种工人有几个？”有的工人强调客观原因，认为出次布多是因为车子修理得不好和断头多的缘故，一九五一织布工作法根本不能提高质量和产量。为了克服工人的保守思想，推广委员会采取两个办法：一是领导干部加强对职工的爱国主义教育，说明推广一九五一织布工作法的政治意义和经济意义，使工人了解一九五一织布工作法的好处，自觉地要求学习。一是有重点地推广，先开办训练班，一方面培养出大批的“小先生”，作为全面推广的骨干；一方面以事实来教育那些不相信一九五一织布工作法的优越性的工人。这个办法对于克服保守思想起的作用很大。譬如，有的老工人听说运用一九五一织布工作法的好处时，曾说“那是熊人”，“吹大气”。但他们看到那些原来在生产上都比不上他们的工人在训练班学习的成绩以后，才真正服气，主动要求学习。
    此外，这个厂在全面推广一九五一织布工作法之前，还做了好多技术上的准备工作——改进技术管理，如过去每换一次经轴平均要五十五分钟；现在，只需要二十二到二十七分钟。这就减少了推广工作的困难。（丁文）
