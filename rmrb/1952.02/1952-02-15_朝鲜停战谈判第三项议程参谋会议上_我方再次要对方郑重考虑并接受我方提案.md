Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 14th: At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 14th, our side once again pointed out: In order to ensure that the military personnel entering Korea during the armistice period are indeed non-reinforcing military personnel, the subcommittee has clearly agreed that after the cessation of hostilities, the rotation of military personnel must not only be carried out on a one-to-one basis, but must also have a certain limit. The other side has no reason to demand an excessively high rotation limit, which fundamentally cancels the practical significance of the rotation limit. After the cessation of hostilities, the entry of military personnel and ammunition into Korea should be greatly reduced. According to the existing agreement, the ammunition entering during the armistice period should be limited to the ammunition consumed after the armistice, and there is no reason to demand too many specific rear ports for the entry of military personnel and ammunition. Our side once again requested the other side to seriously consider and accept our reasonable solution of a monthly rotation limit of 30,000 people and four specific ports for each side.

At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, our side, based on our proposal of February 3 and the opinions exchanged between the two sides after our proposal, put forward a revised draft for reference by both sides during the discussion. Our staff briefly explained each clause of the draft and pointed out that it had adopted all the opinions of the other side that could be adopted as much as possible.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我方再次要对方郑重考虑并接受我方提案
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方再次指出：为保证停战期间进入朝鲜的军事人员确非增援性的军事人员，小组委员会中已明确协议敌对行为终止后，军事人员的轮换，不但必须在一对一的基础上进行，而且必须有一定的限额。对方没有任何理由要求规定过高的轮换限额，而根本取消轮换限额的实际意义。敌对行为终止之后，军事人员与武器弹药的进入朝鲜，更应该有大量的削减。根据已有协议，停战期间所进入的武器弹药应该限于停战后所耗损的武器弹药，更没有任何理由要求过多的后方特定口岸作为输入军事人员与武器弹药之用。我方再次要求对方郑重考虑并接受我方所提出每月三万人的轮换限额与每方四个特定口岸的合理解决方案。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方根据我方二月三日的提案及我方提案提出后双方所交换的意见，提出修正草案，以供双方讨论时参考之用。我方参谋人员就该草案逐款作了简要的说明，并指出已尽可能地采纳了一切可以采纳的对方意见。
