Xinhua News Agency, 6th: TASS Moscow, 3rd – “Pravda” published a dispatch from Cairo on the 3rd, entitled "What is Happening in Egypt?". The author of the letter, Habib, described the events that took place in the Egyptian capital before the change of government. He wrote: It is said that the so-called riots in Cairo on January 26 were pre-arranged by British and American financial groups. News revealed in the newspapers showed that on the eve of these events, certain members of Islamic organizations were told which houses should be set on fire and where to obtain the fuel for the fires.

Obviously, those who organized the riots intended to create conditions that would make it easier for palace figures to remove the Nahas government. The ruling Wafd Party, at the request of palace figures, implemented martial law in the country in order to pave the way for the new government to take the stage.

The author then described the policies of the overthrown Nahas government. He pointed out that the Wafd Party government did not obtain support from the people, did not truly oppose the British occupiers, but embarked on a path of compromise with British and American imperialists. When faced with armed British aggression, this government limited itself to diplomatic protests and talked glibly about severing diplomatic relations with Britain, but dared not bring the issue of British aggression against Egypt to the Security Council. The Nahas government, under threat of the death penalty, prohibited patriotic anti-British demonstrations and gatherings in the country, saying they were "disrupting order and security."

The Nahas government had proven unable to continue and unable to defend Egypt's national demands. At the same time, it could not retreat or simply surrender to Britain, because that would be tantamount to the death of the Wafd Party's political life.

The letter also stated that British and American imperialists used the events of January 26 to overthrow the Nahas government and replace it with another government.

On January 26, the US Ambassador to Cairo, Caffery, visited King Farouk. Later, he met with the British Ambassador, Stevens. On the evening of January 27, the King, on the pretext that "the government's strength was insufficient to guarantee security and order," ordered the dissolution of the Nahas government.

The new Egyptian government is headed by Maher, whose appointment was dictated by British and American financial groups. Among the ministers, there is not a single representative of the Wafd Party, but some cabinet members, such as Hassan Nashat and Mahmoud Hassan (former Ambassador to Washington), are known for advocating Egyptian friendship with the United States and Britain.

Habib concluded his letter by saying that the facts all prove that Egypt's upper-level leaders are preparing to let Egypt join the Middle East aggressive bloc currently being established under the orders of the United States and Britain. To implement this policy, the Maher government is now working hard to win the open support of the Wafd Party. In order to obtain the support of the Wafd Party leaders for the new government, Maher is now negotiating with Nahas.

This is how the Egyptian ruling group is preparing to reach an agreement with British and American imperialists. Although British and American imperialists are competing with each other for control of Egypt, they are united in suppressing the Egyptian people's national liberation movement.

### 苏联真理报刊载开罗来信  英美在埃及制造骚乱  迫使埃及统治集团进一步投降

    苏联真理报刊载开罗来信
    英美在埃及制造骚乱
    迫使埃及统治集团进一步投降
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”三日刊载了一封开罗来信，题为“埃及发生了什么事？”。该信的作者哈比布描述了在政府变动以前埃及首都所发生的事件。他写道：据说一月二十六日在开罗发生的所谓骚乱，是英、美财团预先布置好的。报上透露的消息表明：在发生这些事件的前夕，有人告诉某些回教组织的人哪些房屋应该放火，从哪里取得放火用的燃料。
    很明显的，这些组织骚乱的人们打算创造条件，使宫廷人士能够更轻易地除掉纳哈斯政府。执政党华夫脱党则根据宫廷人士的要求，在国内实施了戒严法，以便为新政府的登台开辟道路。
    作者又叙述了被推翻的纳哈斯政府的政策。他指出：华夫脱党政府没有从人民那里取得支持，没有真正反对英国占领者，而是走上了与英美帝国主义者妥协的道路。这个政府在面临英国的武装侵略时只限于提出外交的抗议，并笼络人心地大谈其和英国断绝外交关系，但不敢将英国侵略埃及的问题提到安全理事会去。纳哈斯政府以死刑为威胁，禁止国内人民举行反英爱国示威游行与集会，说他们“破坏秩序与安全”。
    纳哈斯政府已证明不能够再继续下去，并且不能够卫护埃及的民族要求了。同时，它又不能够退却或索性就在英国面前屈服，因为这样便等于华夫脱党政治生命的死亡。
    该信又称：英美帝国主义者利用一月二十六日的事件推翻了纳哈斯政府，并用另外一个政府代替了它。
    一月二十六日，美国驻开罗大使加佛利访问法鲁克国王。后来他又与英国大使施谛文会谈。一月二十七日晚上，国王藉口“该政府的力量不足以保证安全和秩序”，下令解散了纳哈斯政府。
    新的埃及政府是以马赫尔为首的，他的任命是英美财团所授意的。在大臣里面，没有一个华夫脱党的代表，但是有些内阁人员例如：哈桑那，马茂德·哈森（前驻华盛顿大使）等都是以主张埃及与美英亲善而出名的人。
    哈比布在信的结尾称：事实都证明埃及的上层领袖正在准备让埃及加入目前正在美英的命令下建立的中东侵略集团。马赫尔政府为了实行这个政策，现在正努力争取华夫脱党的公开支持。为了取得华夫脱党领袖对于新政府的支持，马赫尔现在正与纳哈斯进行谈判。
    埃及统治集团就是以这种方式来准备与英美帝国主义者取得协议的。英美帝国主义者彼此之间虽然都在为取得埃及的统治权而竞争，但是他们在镇压埃及人民的民族解放运动方面却是一致的。
