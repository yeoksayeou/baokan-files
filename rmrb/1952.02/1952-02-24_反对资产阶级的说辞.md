Title: Arguments in Favor of the Bourgeoisie

    There are two kinds of arguments that can be heard:
    "It is true that most corruption is the result of bribery by unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists; and it is also true that the theft of state property by these unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists has become so serious that it endangers the country. But this is ultimately not an attack by the bourgeoisie; to call it an attack is not in accordance with the facts. Such a statement is not only not beneficial to the country, but rather..."
    "No, it is acceptable to say it is an attack, and it is not too far from the truth. But I also think that even if the facts are like this, why must we say so clearly and repeatedly that the bourgeoisie is attacking, the bourgeoisie is attacking? Where does this place the entire bourgeoisie? There are also enlightened people among the bourgeoisie... we must think about the consequences."
    These two kinds of arguments seem to stand on the position of the country, taking the overall situation into consideration, but in reality, they are not true, they are all deceptive. These two kinds of people, no matter who they are, are in fact making excuses for the bourgeoisie; it can be said that they are all lobbyists sent by the bourgeoisie.
    The first type of person has actually admitted the fact of the bourgeoisie's attack, but says that it is not in accordance with the facts; he probably thinks that the bourgeoisie must hold a national representative meeting at some location, discuss the attack plan, unanimously pass a resolution, issue a circular, and issue an attack order, and then march forward with drums beating, before it can be considered an attack, before it is in accordance with the facts.
    He probably also wants to say a truth: unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists are not the bourgeoisie; even if they are, they are not the entire bourgeoisie, they cannot represent the bourgeoisie.
    These arguments are to cover up various facts: First, the bourgeoisie certainly has not held a national representative meeting, but the bourgeoisie's bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and materials, and theft of national economic intelligence are rampant everywhere in the country, consistent, and absolutely nationwide. Second, the bourgeoisie certainly does not have a general plan for a class-wide attack, but the bourgeois elements who are stealing and plundering state property are all planned, and the plans are very meticulous, large-scale, and sinister, and the same everywhere in the country; and command posts for planning theft and murder for profit are established everywhere. Third, unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists are precisely the bourgeoisie, although not the entire bourgeoisie, but the number is not small; can they represent the bourgeoisie? It depends on how you say it, but in fact they are already representing the bourgeoisie.
    In short, such arguments are meant to cover up the facts. This kind of person, even if he is not a bourgeois element, is also a lobbyist for the bourgeoisie. If he himself is a member of the bourgeoisie, that goes without saying.
    The second type of person more affirmatively admits the fact of the bourgeoisie's attack, but advocates avoiding the facts, advocating muddling through, and deeply disapproves of not "saving face" for the bourgeoisie; and also speaks with a tone of intimidation, mentioning some "consequences." But who is not saving face for the bourgeoisie? It is the bourgeoisie itself! If there are indeed enlightened people in the bourgeoisie, they should stand up and fight against the illegal and shameless behavior and thinking of the bourgeoisie, and should not avoid the facts. To clearly point out the bourgeoisie's attack and launch a relentless counterattack is indeed not to make the bourgeoisie comfortable; because unscrupulous merchants and illegal capitalists will certainly not feel good, and will be punished, eliminated, and transformed, and other merchants and capitalists should also suddenly and deeply reflect! But, you ask, where will the entire bourgeoisie be placed? Everyone can answer: place the entire bourgeoisie under the Common Program! Everyone also understands that the only way for the bourgeoisie to make a living is to honestly develop production and obtain legitimate profits! This consequence must be achieved, and only in this way will there be good consequences. Otherwise, it will be counterproductive.
    Obviously, this second type of person is even more deliberately making excuses for the bourgeoisie.
    We oppose all such arguments and such lobbyists for the bourgeoisie!

    反对资产阶级的说辞
    雪峰
    听得见这样的两种论调：
    “不错，大部分贪污都是奸商和不法资本家的行贿的结果；而奸商和不法资本家的盗窃国家财产，也确实已严重到危害国家的地步啦。但这究竟不就是资产阶级的进攻；说进攻，是和事实不符的。这样说法于国家不但没有好处，反而…………”
    “不，说进攻是可以的，离事实也不太远。但我也以为，事实虽然如此，却又何必明明白白，且口口声声说资产阶级进攻，资产阶级进攻呢？这样，置整个资产阶级于何地呢？资产阶级中也不乏明哲之士……要想想后果。”
    这两种论调，好像都站在国家的立场，从大局着眼的，但其实不然，都是假的，都是欺世之论。这两种人，不管他们是谁，事实上都在替资产阶级说辞；可以说，他们都是资产阶级派来的说客。
    第一种人，实际上已经承认了资产阶级进攻的事实，然而又说不符合事实；他大概以为必须资产阶级在什么地点开过全国代表会议，讨论过进攻计划，一致通过了决议，发了通电，下了攻击令，然后敲着战鼓进军，才算是进攻，才算是符合事实。
    他大概还要说一种道理：奸商和不法资本家并不就是资产阶级；就算是的，也不是资产阶级全体，他们不能代表资产阶级。
    这些说辞，就是要掩盖种种事实：一、资产阶级诚然没有开过全国代表会议，然而资产阶级进行行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报，却是全国到处都很猖狂的，一致的，绝对地全国性的。二、资产阶级诚然没有全阶级实行进攻的总计划，然而实行盗窃和掠夺国家财物的资产阶级分子却都是有计划的，而且计划都很周密、庞大、阴险，全国到处都一样；并且各地都设立有策划盗窃和谋财害命的参谋部。三、奸商和不法资本家就正是资产阶级，虽然不是资产阶级全体，但数目并不少；他们能不能够代表资产阶级呢？看你如何说法，事实上他们却已经在代表着资产阶级了。
    总之，这样的说辞，是要掩盖事实。这种人，即使他不是资产阶级分子，也是替资产阶级做说客。如果他本身就是资产阶级，那更不必说了。
    第二种人呢，他更其肯定地承认了资产阶级进攻的事实，然而却主张讳言事实，主张蒙混是非，深不以不替资产阶级“留面子”为然；并且还带着恐吓的口吻，说起什么“后果”来了。可是，谁不替资产阶级留面子呢？是资产阶级自己！资产阶级中果然有明哲之士，他就应该起来跟资产阶级的违法无耻的行为和思想斗争，而不应该讳言事实。要明白指出资产阶级的进攻并且无情地举行反攻，确实不是要使资产阶级舒服；因为奸商和不法资本家固然不好受，要被惩罚、清除和改造，就是此外的商人、资本家们也应该猛然深省！但是，你问，将置整个资产阶级于何地么？谁都能够回答：置整个资产阶级于共同纲领之下！也是谁都明白，资产阶级只有诚诚实实地在发展生产和获取合法利润之下讨生活，才是道路！这后果是一定要达到的，也只有这样才有好后果。否则，适得其反。
    显然，这第二种人还更有用心地在替资产阶级说辞。
    我们反对一切诸如此类的说辞以及如此这般的资产阶级的说客！
