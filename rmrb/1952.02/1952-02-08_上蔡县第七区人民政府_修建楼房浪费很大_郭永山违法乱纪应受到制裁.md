    Shangcai County Seventh District People's Government
    Building Construction is Very Wasteful
    Guo Yongshan's Violations of Law and Discipline Should Be Sanctioned
    Comrade Editor: The Seventh District People's Government of Shangcai County, Henan Province, had an original budget of 5,000 jin of wheat for repairs last year (actually planned for building a building). After they obtained the wheat through legal procedures, they demolished the old house (which was not broken or leaking) and built a two-story building with a total of fourteen rooms. In order to obtain bricks, tiles, and wood, they demolished the walls of Zhangzhai, Heizhai, and Zhuhu villages. Because of the construction of this project, they stopped the Huai River harnessing work of three townships, and had about 100 laborers (excluding carts and odd jobs) participate in building the building every day for a month. This project wasted at least 44,000 jin of wheat (not including the public trees that were cut down). They not only did not provide food for the laborers, but also did not pay them wages, so the masses were very dissatisfied. The newly appointed District Head, Zhai Xiangling, was afraid of being punished, but Guo Yongshan, Secretary of the Seventh District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "Don't be afraid. If there are 100 points of error, I will bear 95 points."
    Guo Yongshan's wife successively brought two older sisters and two brothers-in-law from Biyang County, Henan Province. The background of the "Third Sister" family is unknown. Relying on Guo Yongshan's power, they settled down in Heizhai Township and were allocated three shares of land (9.2 mu), a courtyard, three tile-roofed houses, and some daily necessities, etc. The things that these "relatives" received were more than what ordinary poor peasants received, and the masses were very dissatisfied. That "Third Sister," relying on Guo's "power," acted tyrannically, and the masses gave her the nickname "Third Imperial Sister." Guo Yongshan, in order to take care of his wife's younger brother and mother-in-law, used the excuse of "adjustment" to forcibly exchange the land allocated to Ding Changrui, a poor peasant in Dazhai Village, for his mother-in-law's land. Guo also embezzled public funds at the Zhaipeng market to buy a calf and a donkey and had his wife's younger brother, Wang Yuanchen, take them away. That "wife's younger brother" also relied on Guo's "power" to oppress the masses, forcing them to work and run errands for him. The masses called him "Wolf Piglet." Guo Yongshan often ate and drank lavishly at the home of Zhai Man, a middle peasant in Dazhai Village. Zhai Man also raised a pig and two sheep for him. When Zhai Man was the manager of the village cooperative, he was suspected of embezzlement, and the masses demanded an accounting, but Guo Yongshan would not allow it. Guo Yongshan is undemocratic in his work and bullies those below him while deceiving those above him. District cadres dare not raise objections to the work. Because if they raise too many objections, they will either be transferred or attacked.
    Regarding the above situation, please ask the relevant leadership to promptly investigate and deal with it.

### 上蔡县第七区人民政府  修建楼房浪费很大  郭永山违法乱纪应受到制裁

    上蔡县第七区人民政府
    修建楼房浪费很大
    郭永山违法乱纪应受到制裁
    编辑同志：河南省上蔡县第七区人民政府，在去年原预算修补费为小麦五千斤（实际上是计划盖楼）。当他们用合法手续领到小麦后，就把旧房拆掉（该房并不破漏），建筑上下共十四间的楼房一栋。为了要用砖瓦木料，他们曾经把张寨、黑翟、珠湖三寨墙拆毁。因为修建这项工程，他们停止了三个乡的治淮民工的工作，每天让一百个左右民工
    （大车和零工还不在内）参加修楼，为期一月。这项工程，至少浪费小麦四万四千斤（砍用的公树不在内）。他们动用民工不但不给吃，而且不给工资，所以群众大为不满。新任区长翟相灵怕受处分，中共第七区区委书记郭永山说：“不要怕。有一百分错误，我负担九十五分。”
    郭永山的爱人先后从河南省泌阳县引来两个姐姐和两个姐丈。其中“三姐”一家来历不明。依靠郭永山的力量，他们在黑翟乡安了家，并且分得了三份土地（九亩二分）、一处院落、三间瓦房和一些日常用具等。这些“亲戚”所分到的东西，比一般贫农还多，群众很不满意。那位“三姐”，依仗郭的“势力”，横行霸道，群众给他取个外号叫“三皇姑”。郭永山又为了照顾他妻弟和丈母娘，藉口“调整”，强把当地大翟村贫农丁长瑞分到的土地，换给他丈母娘。郭又在翟棚集上挪用公款买一个牛犊、一个驴交给他妻弟王元臣拉走。那位“妻弟”也依仗郭的“势力”，欺压群众，强迫群众给他做活、跑脚，群众称他为“狼猪子”。郭永山经常到大翟村中农翟满家大吃大喝，翟满还给他养着一个猪、两只羊。翟满任该村合作社经理时，有贪污嫌疑，群众要求算账，而郭永山却不让算。郭永山在工作上不民主，欺上压下。区干部对工作有意见不敢提。因为提的多了，不是被调动工作便是受到打击。
    以上情况，请有关领导方面迅速检查处理。
