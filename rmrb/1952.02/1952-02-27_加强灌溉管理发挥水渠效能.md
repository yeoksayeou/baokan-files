    Strengthen Irrigation Management to Maximize Canal Efficiency

    The fact that more than thirty breaches occurred in the east and west main canals of the Qingyuan and Wenshui counties, which belong to the Fen River system under the jurisdiction of the Shanxi Fen River Water Conservancy Committee, fully demonstrates that irrigation management work cannot be neglected.

    The reasons for this breach and water loss, in addition to the lack of a comprehensive perspective in formulating canal engineering plans and the failure to effectively lead the masses to complete the project to the required standards during construction, the more important reason is the neglect of irrigation management work. The Fen River Water Conservancy Committee failed to rely on the masses and give play to their enthusiasm to strengthen the irrigation management of the canal. They allowed the masses to set up many pontoon bridges along the canal, allowing them to block the water flow; many cracks appeared in the canal embankment, but they were not checked and repaired in time. When watering in early February this year, the Fen River Water Conservancy Committee not only failed to pay attention to the situation of ice blocking the water, but even the regular and necessary canal inspection system was not seriously implemented, resulting in breaches and water loss everywhere in the canal embankment. All these fully illustrate that the Fen River Water Conservancy Committee has serious thoughts of complacency and carelessness in canal management work, and has adopted a bureaucratic style of abandoning leadership and separating from the masses.

    The "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Drought Prevention and Drought Resistance Campaign" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government specifically emphasized: "Irrigation management should be strengthened for all canals, dams, and weirs." This is an issue that must be seriously addressed. Local agricultural water conservancy leading organs should learn from this lesson, immediately strengthen the irrigation management of all canals, use water rationally, complete the spring irrigation tasks, and ensure timely sowing. For new projects that have not yet been completed, it is necessary to rely on the masses to do the project effectively and correct the blind practice of "engineering for the sake of engineering" without regard to benefits.

    加强灌溉管理发挥水渠效能
    山西汾河水利委员会所管辖的汾河水系清源、文水两县所属东、西干渠决口三十多处的事实，充分说明了灌溉管理工作是忽视不得的。
    这次决口失水的原因，除了制订水渠工程计划时缺乏全面观点和施工中没有切实领导群众把工程作到应有的标准之外，更重要的是忽视了灌溉管理工作。汾河水利委员会没有依靠群众和发挥群众的积极性来加强渠道的灌溉管理，放任群众沿渠架设许多浮桥，任其阻挡水流；渠堤出现许多裂缝，也没有及时检查修补。今年二月初浇水时，汾河水利委员会不仅对拥冰堵水的情况没有切实注意，甚至连经常必要的巡视渠道制度都没有认真执行，结果发展到渠堤到处决口失水。这些都充分说明了汾河水利委员会在渠道管理工作上有严重的麻痹大意思想和放弃领导、脱离群众的官僚主义作风。
    中央人民政府政务院发布的“关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”中，特别强调指出：“对一切渠道坝堰，应加强灌溉管理”，这是必须切实注意解决的一个问题。各地农田水利领导机关应当接受这次教训，立即加强所有渠道的灌溉管理工作，合理用水，完成春浇任务，保证及时播种。对于还未完成的新工程，必须依靠群众把工程切实做好，纠正“为工程而工程”，而不问效益的盲目作法。
