    Remember the Blood Debt of the American Imperialists

    Editor: The workers of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company were jumping with anger when they heard the news of the invading American troops in Korea frenziedly spreading bacteria. Zhang Genrong, a bricklayer who is rushing to build the Red Cross Hospital, said: "The American imperialists are truly vicious and want to use bacteriological weapons to save their defeat. I will definitely work with other workers to build the hospital building well so that the most beloved people can quickly recover their health and strike at those conscienceless things." Zhang Zhenming, a steel bar worker, said: "The Japanese imperialists failed with bacteriological weapons, and the American imperialists will not escape this result either." Dai Jianjie, a bricklayer, proposed the slogan: "Laying one more brick is equal to hitting one more American wolf." Many workers wrote indictments to the peace-loving people of the world, accusing the American imperialists of their crimes, and demanding severe punishment for those executioners who violated international law.

    要记住美帝国主义者的这笔血债
    编辑同志：北京市建筑工程公司的工人看到侵朝美军疯狂撒放细菌的消息后，都气愤得跳起来了。正在赶工修建红十字会医院的瓦工张根荣说：“美帝国主义真是穷凶极恶，企图用细菌武器挽回它的败局。我一定和其他工人把医院房子盖好，让最可爱的人很快地恢复健康，打击那些狼心狗肺的东西。”铁筋工张珍明说：“日本帝国主义者用细菌武器失败了，美帝国主义也逃不掉这个结果。”瓦工戴建洁提出：“多砌一块砖，等于多打一个美国狼”的口号。很多工人写了向全世界和平人民控诉美帝国主义罪行的控诉书，要求严厉惩办那些违反国际法的刽子手。
