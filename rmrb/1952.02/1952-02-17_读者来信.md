    Students of Beijing Normal University
    Demand Severe Punishment for the Treacherous Merchant Li Yinting, Who Harmed the Volunteer Army
    Comrade Editor: The People's Daily on February 15th published the news "Treacherous Merchant Li Yinting from Hankou Used Rotten Cotton to Pack First-Aid Kits, Harming the Volunteer Army." All students of the Normal University expressed boundless indignation at the monstrous crimes of this treacherous merchant. On the same day, the Student Union received many letters from students demanding that the People's Government punish these madmen and vermin who harmed the People's Volunteer Army with the utmost severity.
    Weng Shisheng and other students from the Second Grade of the Education Department wrote in their letter: "We visited Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers during the summer vacation last year. It is difficult for us to describe the emotions we felt when we saw the Volunteer Army comrades who were wounded and disabled in order to defend our peaceful and happy lives. In the past, we never imagined that among the murderers of our most beloved people, besides the American imperialists, there would also be Chinese treacherous merchants! The treacherous merchants damaged the health of the Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers, causing many wounded and sick soldiers to become disabled who should not have been, and sacrificed who should not have been. We demand that the government punish these pests and vermin with the utmost severity, and at the same time, we guarantee to do our work well and strive for the complete victory of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement."
    All the students of Building 7 of the Freshmen Class of the Chemistry Department said: "Before liberation, the industrial and commercial circles were subjected to the extortion and blows of the Kuomintang bandit gang and American imperialism and fell into desperation. After liberation, our government did its best to support them. Unexpectedly, some lawless capitalists repaid kindness with enmity and attacked us with such vicious means."
    Guo Fuseng and other students from the Third Grade of the Physics Department said: "From this wolf-hearted and mad treacherous merchant Li Yinting, we have clearly seen the utter corruption and reaction of the treacherous merchants. They are profit-oriented, unscrupulous, attack the Volunteer Army, and act as accomplices of American imperialism. We must defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attack."
                  Beijing Normal University Correspondence Group
    Suggest the People's Government Publicly Try the Heinous Treacherous Merchant Li Yinting
    Comrade Editor: I hate the treacherous merchant Li Yinting with gnashing teeth. He is as ugly as the American imperialist aggressors. I believe that the people of New China will never tolerate the crimes committed by the treacherous merchant Li Yinting. Everyone knows that our "most beloved people," in order to defend the peaceful and happy lives of the people of the whole world and the people of the motherland, are heroically and arduously fighting the enemy on the Korean front, shedding blood and sweat, and even sacrificing their most precious lives. How should we respect them! How should we do everything in our power to support them! However, the treacherous merchant Li Yinting only cared about making a fortune and illegally profiting, and cruelly and shamefully, from the medical (first-aid kit) orders of the people of the Central and Southern China region supporting the Volunteer Army, cut corners, replaced good cotton with waste cotton, and poisoned the Volunteer Army. What does poisoning the Volunteer Army mean? It means poisoning the Chinese and Korean people, which is poisoning world peace. Please see, how hateful is the crime of the treacherous merchant Li Yinting! Li Yinting is our fierce enemy, whether politically or economically. I firmly support the suggestion of the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army, demanding that the treacherous merchant Li Yinting, who harmed the Volunteer Army, be severely punished, and suggest that the People's Government convene a mass meeting to publicly try this heinous traitor to the motherland.
                              Ku Sen
    The Treacherous Merchant Li Yinting's Crimes Are Unforgivable!
    Comrade Editor: Every one of our comrades hates the anti-people monstrous crimes of the treacherous merchant Li Yinting with gnashing teeth.
    Through this lesson written in blood, we have further recognized the ferocious face of the bourgeoisie. They use all the most vile, shameless, insidious, and vicious means to destroy and corrode the newborn motherland built by the Chinese people with every drop of blood and sweat. In order to fill their greedy bellies, they even launched a shameless attack on the most noble and beloved outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people - the Chinese People's Volunteer Army - who are selflessly and heroically fighting the enemy for the sake of defending the newborn motherland and for the liberation of the Korean people.
    Every conscientious Chinese person must not turn a blind eye to this rampant attack by the bourgeoisie, especially the crimes of those inhuman and profit-oriented major treacherous merchants. We must resolutely defeat the bourgeoisie's attack.
    Li Yinting is a typical example of lawless capitalists attacking us, a typical example of those treacherous merchants whose souls are bewitched by money and who cannot talk about "loving the motherland" or "loving the people" at all.
    We demand that the Hankou Municipal People's Government publicly try the traitor Li Yinting of the motherland and the people. And please ask the government to grant our request: to give Li Yinting the most severe punishment!

    Suggest the Government Severely Punish the Treacherous Merchant Liu Chengmo, et al.
    Comrade Editor: Liu Chengmo, Dong Zhuochao, Han Zongzhi, and Liu Yi, treacherous merchants of the Beijing Yongtai Construction Factory, specialize in bribing cadres in order to contract for projects. From 1949 to 1950, most of the construction projects of several units of a certain department were undertaken by them. They were very resourceful and knew whether a unit's construction budget would be approved and how much would be approved after it was submitted. During construction, they cut corners and then used bribery to silence certain cadres. Huang Wenjian, the chief of the General Affairs Section of a certain department, was one who was hit by a sugar-coated bullet. Therefore, many problems occurred in the construction project of the department's large warehouse. The lead-iron roof that they guaranteed would not leak within a year leaked even worse than before it was repaired after only a few days of snow. The cement floor that was built rose in winter when frozen and fell in summer when heated, and soon cracked. The slate tiles fell to the ground with a gust of wind, and the bricks used fell apart with a touch. How many hundreds of millions of yuan were spent on construction projects, which were just handed over in such a sloppy manner. Li Zhi, the construction factory supervisor, once said: "If we build like this, to be honest, it's not even 50% up to standard, but I'm still criticized at the accounting department." In 1950, Beijing was once in short supply of cement, so they took the opportunity to transport a batch of goods from Taiyuan and made a huge profit of 200 to 300 million yuan in one transaction. Now they have been arrested by the People's Government. I demand that the People's Government severely punish these heinous major treacherous merchants.
                A Warehouse Worker of a Certain Department, Li Shouheng
    Reverse Assets in the Hands of Treacherous Merchants Should be Investigated
    Comrade Editor: Guo Delin, the director of the Nanchang Automobile Industry Association - treacherous merchant, stole more than 130 barrels of various gasoline, engine oil, diesel oil, and 30 boxes of padlocks, etc., from the warehouse of the pseudo-Navy Department a few days before liberation. Zhou Jue, a treacherous merchant of a certain automobile company in Shangrao City, bought four cars and more than 400 barrels of gasoline at low prices when it was about to be liberated. These crimes of stealing state property have recently been exposed by the workers. From the above examples, we can see that some treacherous merchants used various despicable and shameless means to hide, distribute, and sell off reverse assets just after liberation. Therefore, I suggest that in this national large-scale movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence, the reverse assets in the hands of treacherous merchants should be thoroughly investigated so that the people's property can truly return to the people. Mu Lei
    Chen Zhiwen, Deputy Dean of the People's Court of Suiyuan Province
    Corruption, Waste, and Obstruction of the Anti-Corruption Movement
    Chen Zhiwen, Deputy Dean of the People's Court of Suiyuan Province, and his wife, Qiu Yumin (Chief of the Secretariat Section of the People's Court of Suiyuan Province), are seriously corrupt and wasteful, always aloof and self-righteous. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Chen Zhiwen suppressed democracy and obstructed the movement. Now, we will only report some of the materials we know as follows:
    1. Chen Zhiwen entrusted someone to buy two swimming watches and two fountain pens from Guangzhou, and gave items worth more than 400,000 yuan to the person who bought them on his behalf. Last December, Chen Zhiwen sent someone to Guangzhou under the pretext of buying a car to buy two leather suitcases, several pens, six dozen woolen shirts, and a large number of items such as swimming watches. May I ask where did this money come from?
    2. In 1951, Chen Zhiwen alone spent more than 4 million yuan on entertaining guests. Someone went to the court every day and ate guest meals every day, and Chen Zhiwen accompanied them to eat in order to save his "contracted expenses." Chen Zhiwen used a large amount of confiscated property to decorate the court's courtroom, arbitrarily squandering and wasting. Chen Zhiwen also privately gave the confiscated pistols of counter-revolutionaries to Wu Buyuan, the director of the Suiyuan Provincial Transportation Bureau. When Qiu Yumin gave birth to a child, she accepted a large number of gifts from retained personnel; when the child was a month old, she held a large banquet to entertain the people who gave gifts. May I ask where did this money come from? Chen Zhiwen once used his qualifications as the dean to issue a bicycle to Wu Wenbin, a cadre who had a good relationship with him, for his own use.
    3. Chen Zhiwen is still leading the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Provincial Court. I believe that Chen Zhiwen is not qualified for this position. Because not only does he not explain his own problems to the masses, but he suppresses democracy and makes it impossible for the movement in the Provincial Court to be carried out. When someone made a suggestion to him, he said: "Your political courage is not enough." When comrades from the court reflected the real situation of the agency at the United Front Work Conference convened by the United Front Work Department of the Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, he threatened this comrade, saying, "If you have any opinions, you should raise them internally. Why are you talking nonsense outside?" Many comrades said: "This is the Chen family's court." I feel that not only is he not qualified to lead the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, but he has become a stumbling block in the movement. I hope that the relevant leaders will quickly investigate and deal with this matter. Jing Hui

    北京师范大学学生
    要求严惩暗害志愿军的奸商李寅廷
    编辑同志：二月十五日人民日报刊出了“汉口奸商李寅廷用烂棉花装救急包暗害志愿军”的消息。师范大学全体同学对于奸商这种滔天罪行，一致表示无比的愤恨。当天，学生会就收到同学们许多来信，要求人民政府把这些丧心病狂的暗害人民志愿军的奸商处以极刑。
    教育系二年级同学翁世盛等在信中写道：“我们在去年暑假慰问过一次志愿军伤病员，我们很难写出我们看见为了保卫我们的和平幸福生活而受伤残废的志愿军同志们时的感情。过去，我们无论如何也想不到杀害我们最可爱的人的凶手中，除了美帝国主义外，还有中国的奸商！奸商们损害志愿军伤病员的健康，使很多伤病员不该残废的残废了，不该牺牲的牺牲了。我们要求政府对这些害虫蟊贼处以极刑，同时我们也保证一定把工作做好，争取反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的完全胜利。”
    化学系新生楼七号全体同学说：“解放以前，工商界受国民党匪帮和美帝国主义的搜括打击，陷入绝境。解放以后，我们的政府尽力扶持了他们。想不到其中的不法资本家竟恩将仇报，向我们下这样的毒手。”
    物理系三年级郭孚僧等同学说：“从这个狼心狗肺、丧心病狂的奸商李寅廷身上，我们十分清楚地看见了奸商腐朽反动透顶。他们唯利是图，不择手段，向志愿军进攻，作美帝国主义的帮凶。我们一定要把资产阶级的猖狂进攻打下去。”
                  北京师范大学通讯组
    建议人民政府公审罪大恶极的奸商李寅廷
    编辑同志：我切齿痛恨奸商李寅廷。他和美帝国主义侵略者一样丑恶。我认为凡是新中国的人民，是绝不会容忍奸商李寅廷所犯的罪行的。谁都知道：我们的“最可爱的人”为了保卫全世界人民和祖国人民的和平幸福生活，在朝鲜前线英勇地艰苦地打击着敌人，流血流汗，甚至献出了他们最宝贵的生命。我们应该是如何敬爱他们！我们应该是如何尽一切的力量去支援他们！可是，奸商李寅廷却只顾他发横财，攫取非法利润，竟残酷地、丑恶地从中南区人民支援志愿军的医药（救急包）订货中，偷工减料，用废棉盗换好棉，毒害志愿军。毒害志愿军是什么意思呢？就是毒害中朝人民，就是毒害世界和平。请看，奸商李寅廷的罪恶是多么令人痛恨！李寅廷无论从政治上或经济上都是我们的凶恶的敌人。我坚决拥护志愿军归国代表的建议，要求严惩暗害志愿军的奸商李寅廷，并建议人民政府召开群众大会公审这个罪大恶极的祖国叛徒。
                              枯　森
    奸商李寅廷罪不可恕！
    编辑同志：我们每个同志都切齿痛恨奸商李寅廷反人民的滔天罪行。
    通过这一血的教训，我们进一步地认清了资产阶级的狰狞面目。他们用尽一切最卑鄙无耻、最阴险毒辣的手段，摧残、腐蚀着中国人民一滴血、一滴汗建设起来的新生的祖国。他们为了填满那贪婪的肚子，甚至向为了保卫新生的祖国，为了朝鲜人民的解放，而忘我地和敌人英勇搏斗的最高尚最可爱的中国人民的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军发动了无耻的进攻。
    每一个有良心的中国人，对资产阶级这种猖狂的进攻，尤其是对那些丧失了人性的、唯利是图的大奸商的罪恶，绝不能置之不理。我们要坚决打垮资产阶级的进攻。
    李寅廷就是不法资本家对我们进攻的一个典型，就是那些金钱迷住了灵魂的，根本谈不上什么“爱祖国”“爱人民”的奸商的典型。
    我们要求汉口市人民政府公审祖国和人民的叛徒李寅廷。并请政府答应我们的要求：给李寅廷以最严厉的制裁！

    建议政府严厉制裁奸商刘承谟等
    编辑同志：北京永泰营造厂奸商刘承谟、董卓超、韩宗智、刘艺专门向机关干部行贿，以便承包工程。一九四九年到一九五○年，某部几个单位的修建工程，大多由他们承担。他们神通广大，一个单位的修建预算报出后，就知道批准与否和批准多少。施工时，他们偷工减料，然后用贿赂手段堵某些干部的口。某部总务股长黄文建就是被糖衣炮弹击中的一个。因此，某部大仓房的修建工程就出了很多毛病。他们曾保证一年内不漏雨的铅铁顶，竣工没有几天，下了一次雪，就比没有修时更漏得厉害。修建的洋灰地，冬天一冻就高了起来，夏天一热又降了下去，不久就裂了。石板瓦一刮风就掉地，所用的砖一动就掉面。花了多少亿元修建的工程，就这样胡乱地缴了工。营造厂监工员李智曾说：“就这样修建，说真的，连五成工都够不上，但柜上对我还加批评。”一九五○年，北京的洋灰一度很缺乏，他们就利用时机，从太原运来了一批货，一转手之间，获得暴利二、三亿元。现在，他们已被人民政府逮捕了。我要求人民政府严惩这些罪大恶极的大奸商。
                某部一仓库工人　李寿恒
    应追查奸商手中的逆产
    编辑同志：南昌市汽车同业公会主任——奸商郭德邻，在解放前几日从伪海军部仓库偷窃各种汽油、机油、柴油等一百三十多桶，及洋锁等物三十箱。上饶市某汽车行奸商周觉在将解放时，以贱价买到汽车四辆，汽油四百多桶。这些盗窃国家财产的罪行，最近都被工人们检举出来了。从上例可以看到，有些奸商在刚解放时，曾用各种卑鄙无耻的手段来隐藏、分散、变卖逆产。因此，我建议在这次全国性大规模的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动中，应彻底追查奸商手中的逆产，使人民的财产真正重归人民。　慕　雷
    绥远省人民法院副院长陈质文
    贪污浪费并阻碍反贪污运动
    绥远省人民法院副院长陈质文和他的爱人仇育民（绥远省人民法院秘书科长）贪污浪费严重，一贯高高在上，唯我独尊。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，陈质文压制民主、阻碍运动。现在只把我们所知道的一些材料检举如下：
    一、陈质文托人从广州买游泳手表两块、自来水笔两支，并且把价值四十多万元的物品送给代买人。去年十二月，陈质文又派人到广州借买汽车之名，买皮箱两个、钢笔数支、绒衣六打及游泳手表等大批物品。请问这些钱是从那儿来的？
    二、一九五一年，只陈质文一人即化用招待客饭费四百多万元。某人每天去法院，每天吃客饭，陈质文自己还陪着吃，以便省下他的“包干费”。陈质文大量动用没收的财产，布置法院的法庭，任意挥霍、浪费。陈质文并把没收的反革命犯的手枪，私自送给绥远省交通局局长吴步渊。仇育民生小孩时，接受留用人员的大量礼物；小孩满月时，大设筵席招待送礼的人。请问这些钱从何处来？陈质文曾以院长资格给和他关系好的干部武文彬领自行车一辆自用。
    三、陈质文现在还在领导省法院反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。我认为：陈质文没有资格担任这个职务。因为他不但不向群众交代自己的问题，反而压制民主，使省法院的运动搞不起来。有人向他提意见，他反说：“你政治气魄不足。”中共绥远省委统战部召开统战会议，法院同志反映该机关真实情况时，他威胁这个同志说：“有意见应在内部提，为什么跑到外边乱说？”很多同志说：“这是陈家法院。”我觉得：他不只没有资格领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，并且已成为运动中的拦路虎了。我希望有关领导方面赶快调查处理这件事。    景辉
