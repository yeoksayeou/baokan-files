    The Profiteer Shi Liru Should Be Severely Punished

    To the Editor: After reading about the crimes of the 62 profiteers arrested in Beijing, as published in the People's Daily on February 1st, I believe that the crimes of Shi Liru, the manager of Guangda Grain Store, have reached an extreme. In order to seek exorbitant profits, Shi Liru shamelessly adulterated a large amount of soil into the dried vegetables ordered by the Volunteer Army. For the sake of the country's security and the people's happiness, the Volunteer Army is living a hard life on the front lines, eating a mouthful of fried flour and a mouthful of snow, while the profiteer Shi Liru is heartlessly exploiting them. All people who love the motherland will certainly not tolerate a profiteer like Shi Liru. I hope that the People's Government will give the most severe punishment to this major pest, Shi Liru.

    奸商石利如应受严厉惩处
    编辑同志：我看了二月一日人民日报上刊载的北京市逮捕的六十二名奸商的罪行后，认为广达粮栈经理石利如的罪恶达到了极点。石利如为了谋取暴利，竟卑鄙地在志愿军定购的菜干中，大量掺土。为了祖国的安全和人民的幸福，志愿军在前线上过着一口炒面一口雪的艰苦生活，而奸商石利如却毫无人心地在他们身上进行剥削。凡是热爱祖国的人民，都一定不能容忍石利如这样的奸商。我希望人民政府对石利如这个大害虫，给以最严厉的惩处。
