    A Method for Newspapers to Promote the Current Movement
    ——Henan Daily Organizes Readers to Discuss Typical Wasteful Incidents in the Newspaper
    In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Henan Daily organized readers to discuss the typical extravagant waste incident of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China in the newspaper, which greatly promoted the movement.
    At the beginning of the movement, Henan Daily paid attention to this method of guiding the movement. When they discovered the huge waste incident of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China spending 250 million yuan in ten days on entertaining the inspection delegation of the head office and the summary meeting, the editorial board immediately held a meeting to study it. Everyone believed that this incident was typical, and carrying out a mass criticism and discussion based on this would have universal educational significance. Therefore, Henan Daily published the materials of this incident in a prominent position, and at the same time published a short commentary, pointing out the seriousness of the incident. After the above news and commentary were published, they attracted the close attention of the majority of readers, who wrote letters to participate in the discussion. Up to now, Henan Daily has received more than 400 letters from readers in the discussion of this incident, and many people have also expressed their opinions to the newspaper by phone or in person. Most of the participants in the discussion were workers, cadres, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and farmers, who severely criticized the mistake of wasting state property. Many leading cadres of government agencies and enterprises also linked the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in their own units and made public self-criticisms. Henan Daily continuously published the important opinions of readers and the self-criticisms of some enterprise leaders in the newspaper, and wrote editor's notes to encourage the masses to resolutely and bravely fight against corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic elements.
    While organizing mass discussions, Henan Daily continuously wrote letters to the head office of the People's Bank of China, the Central South District Branch, and the Henan Provincial Branch, conveying readers' opinions to them, and asking them to make self-criticisms in the newspaper. In addition, they also wrote to Bo Yibo, director of the Central Thrift Inspection Committee, to report readers' opinions on the National Bank. Hu Jingyun (head of the head office inspection delegation), Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Chen Xiyu, Governor of the Central South District Branch, and He Youqi and Li Shaoyu, Deputy Governors, Zhang Haotian, Governor of the Henan Provincial Branch, and Zhou Shixuan, Deputy Governor, all accepted the readers' solemn criticism and made self-criticisms in Henan Daily successively.
    The wide discussion and criticism of this incident in the newspaper greatly promoted the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in various agencies in Henan Province. At the beginning of the movement, the leading cadres of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China did not think that this incident was a serious waste behavior, but thought it was for "work," and the lower-level cadres did not dare to raise their opinions. Through this mass criticism, the Governor and Deputy Governor of the branch made more profound self-criticisms, the masses were generally mobilized, and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was successfully launched. After the discussion of this incident, readers in various places further recognized the importance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, so the letters exposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy sent to Henan Daily increased day by day, and many units and individuals who were criticized and exposed made self-criticisms in Henan Daily.

    报纸推动当前运动的一种方法
    ——河南日报组织读者在报纸上讨论典型的浪费事件
    在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中，河南日报组织读者在报纸上讨论了中国人民银行河南省分行铺张浪费的典型事件，对运动起了很大的推动作用。
    运动开始时，河南日报即注意了这一指导运动的方法。当他们发现中国人民银行河南省分行在招待总行视察团视察总结会议上十天内开支二亿五千万元的巨大浪费事件后，编辑委员会立即召开会议，对此进行研究。大家认为这个事件是典型的，以此开展一个群众性的批判和讨论，有普遍的教育意义。因此，河南日报将这一事件的材料在显著地位发表，并同时发表短评，指出事件的严重性。上述消息和短评发表后，引起广大读者的密切注意，纷纷写信参加讨论。到目前为止，河南日报在这一事件的讨论中，已收到读者来信四百多件，还有许多人用电话或亲到报社发表自己的意见。参加讨论的大部分是工人、机关干部、革命残废军人和农民，他们严厉地指责了这种浪费国家财产的错误。有许多机关、企业的领导干部也都联系自己本单位的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，公开作了自我检讨。河南日报把读者的重要意见及有些企业领导人员的自我检讨，连续在报上发表，并撰写编者按语，鼓励群众坚决、勇敢地向贪污、浪费和官僚主义分子作斗争。
    河南日报在组织群众讨论的同时，曾连续写信给中国人民银行总行、中南区行及河南省分行，转达读者对他们的意见，要求他们在报纸上进行检讨。另外还给中央节约检查委员会薄一波主任写信，报告读者对国家银行的意见。中国人民银行总行副行长胡景澐（总行视察团负责人）、中南区行行长陈希愈、副行长何幼琦、李绍禹、河南省分行行长张皓天、副行长周时煊等都接受了读者的严正批评，先后在河南日报上作了检讨。
    这一事件在报纸上的广泛讨论和批判，对河南省各机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的推动作用很大。中国人民银行河南省分行在运动开始时，领导干部并不认为这一事件是严重的浪费行为，而认为是为了“工作”，下级干部有意见也不敢提，通过这次群众性的批判，该行行长、副行长都作了较深刻的检讨，群众普遍发动起来，顺利展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。经过这一事件的讨论，各地读者更进一步认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重要性，因而向河南日报投送的揭发贪污、浪费、官僚主义的信件日渐增加，许多被批评被揭发的单位和个人，都在河南日报上进行了检讨。
