People's Organizations in North China Protest U.S. Military's Spreading of Bacteria

[Reported by this newspaper] People's organizations in North China unanimously protested the heinous crime of the U.S. invading army spreading bacteria in Korea. The North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the North China Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the North China General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and the North China Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a joint statement pointing out: This heinous crime of the U.S. aggressors directly inherits the mantle of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. The German, Italian, and Japanese fascists have already been justly sanctioned by the people of the world in World War II. Today, U.S. imperialism has embarked on this old path, and the noose of justice awaits them. The statement called on all the people of North China to more actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, further strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and fight to the end to completely defeat the U.S. invading army.

People's organizations in Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and other provinces successively issued joint statements on the 25th and 28th, solemnly condemning this heinous crime of the U.S. invading army, and calling on the people to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The medical communities in various provinces have all proposed to take practical actions to retaliate against the atrocities of U.S. imperialism. The statement of the Hebei Provincial Health Workers Association pointed out indignantly: Some villages in Ding County, Hebei Province, suffered from the harm of Japanese invaders spreading bacteria during the Anti-Japanese War. This blood debt has not yet been repaid, and Japanese war criminals have not yet received the punishment they deserve, but the U.S. aggressors have come to commit violence again, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. The health workers of our Hebei Province must take urgent action to do a good job in the people's health and epidemic prevention work. All students of the Medical College of Shanxi University, medical workers in Taiyuan City, and the Medical Workers Committee of the Education Trade Union in Zhangjiakou City unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the Korean front to support the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's forces.

    抗议美军撒布细菌
    【本报讯】华北区各人民团体一致抗议美国侵略军在朝鲜撒布细菌的滔天罪行。中华全国总工会华北工作委员会、新民主主义青年团华北工作委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会华北总分会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会华北筹备委员会发表联合声明指出：美国侵略者的这种令人发指的罪行是直接继承了德、意、日法西斯的衣钵的，德、意、日法西斯已在第二次世界大战中遭到全世界人民的正义制裁，今天美帝国主义已走上了这条老路，正义的绞索正等待着他们。声明号召全华北人民更加积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，进一步加强抗美援朝工作，以支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，为彻底打垮美国侵略军而斗争到底。
    山西、平原、察哈尔等省各人民团体在二十五、二十八两日先后发表联合声明，严正声讨美国侵略军的这种滔天罪行，并号召人民继续加强抗美援朝工作。各省医务界都提出要以实际行动，来还击美帝国主义的暴行。河北省卫生工作者协会的声明愤慨指出：我们河北省定县有些村庄在抗日战争时期，就曾遭受过日本侵略者撒布细菌的毒害，现在这笔血债还没偿还，日本战犯还没受到应得的惩办，而美国侵略者又来行凶，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。我们河北省的卫生工作者一定紧急行动起来，做好人民卫生防疫工作。山西大学医学院全体学生、太原市医务工作者和张家口市教育工会医务工作委员会一致表示，决心随时响应祖国的号召，到朝鲜前线去支援朝鲜人民和中、朝人民部队。
