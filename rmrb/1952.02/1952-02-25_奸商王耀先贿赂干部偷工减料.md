    Profiteer Wang Yaoxian Bribes Cadres, Skimps on Work and Materials

    Editor: The profiteer Wang Yaoxian is the manager of the Beijing Yaoxian Construction Company. Last year, he contracted to build a car depot for a certain unit of the North China Military Region and massively bribed Sun Zirui, the accountant of the unit. He asked Sun Zirui to buy public cement for him, saying, "Old brother, you have to help with the cement purchase. I'll give you ten million yuan if you get this done." He used such vile and shameless methods to buy 450 bags of public cement (each bag was more than 60,000 yuan cheaper), stealing over 27 million yuan of state property. He did not construct according to the contract and skimped on work and materials. The contract originally stipulated that the cement floor should be 15 centimeters thick, but in reality, except for a very thin layer of cement on the surface, the bottom was all sand and gravel. He often stole cement by the truckload at night when no one was around. Most of the timber used in the entire project was old, wet, or cracked. Two beams were particularly bad, and the unit's personnel asked him to replace them with good ones, but he bribed Sun Zirui with two million yuan and only replaced one. This car depot was built tall and large, which is very unsuitable, and now it is already teetering. According to preliminary estimates, the profiteer skimped on work and materials to the tune of over 100 million yuan, causing the state to suffer losses of 400 million yuan. I demand that the People's Government severely punish the profiteer Wang Yaoxian.

    奸商王耀先贿赂干部偷工减料
    编辑同志：奸商王耀先是北京耀先营造厂的经理。他去年承包了华北军区某部汽车库房的工程，向该部会计员孙子瑞大肆行贿。他要孙子瑞给他买公家的洋灰，说：“老兄，买洋灰的问题你要帮忙。这件事办好了给你一千万元。”他利用这种卑鄙无耻的手段，前后共买去公家洋灰四百五十袋（每袋便宜六万多元），盗骗国家财产二千七百多万元。他不按合同施工，偷工减料。合同原规定地面洋灰厚十五公分，而实际上，除表面有一层很薄的洋灰外，底下全是砂土、石子。他常乘黑夜没有人的时候，把洋灰成车成车地偷走。在整个工程中所用的木料，大部分是旧木、湿木，或是有裂缝的。其中有两根梁特别坏，该部人员叫他换好的，但他贿赂了孙子瑞二百万元，只换了一根。这座汽车库房盖得又高又大，很不合用，而且现在已摇摇欲坠了。据初步估计，奸商偷工减料在一亿元以上，而国家因此所受损失有四亿元。我要求人民政府严惩奸商王耀先。    郜勇
