    Comrades on the National Anti-Epidemic Front, Rise Up to Oppose the New Conspiracy of the United States to Wage Bacteriological Warfare
    Zhang Muqian, Captain of the General Anti-Epidemic Team, Ministry of Health

    Following its various heinous atrocities in Korea, the American invading army has now massively scattered insects carrying bacteria over the front lines and rear areas of Korea, attempting to use bacteria to poison peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean People's forces. This proves that the brutality, arrogance, and despicable shamelessness of the American aggressors have reached their extreme. We, the Chinese people, will never agree to this beastly behavior that dares to disregard human justice and international law. With incomparable anger, we warn the American aggressors: this insane and monstrous crime must be stopped immediately; the murderers who planned and carried out the bacteriological warfare must be immediately handed over to righteous people for the most severe trial!

    We call on comrades on the national anti-epidemic front to urgently mobilize, closely monitor this new conspiracy of the enemy, make all preparations, and resolutely defend the lives and health of the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's armies. We believe that bacteriological warfare can only further expose the enemy's ferocious face, illustrating that the American invading army is making a desperate struggle, and cannot save its military defeat.

    全国防疫战线上的同志们起来反对美国进行细菌战的新阴谋
    中央卫生部防疫总队总队长  张木千
    美国侵略军在朝鲜继其种种惨绝人寰的暴行之后，又在朝鲜前线和后方上空，大批地撒放带有细菌的昆虫，企图用细菌来毒杀朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民部队，这证明美国侵略者残暴狂妄和卑鄙无耻已达极点。我们中国人民决不答应敌人这种胆敢不顾人类正义和国际公法的野兽行为。我们以无比愤怒的心情，警告美国侵略者：这种丧心病狂的滔天罪行，必须立即停止；计划与制造细菌战的凶手们，必须立即交由正义的人们来作最严厉的裁判！
    我们号召全国防疫战线上的同志们，紧急动员起来，严密注视敌人这一新的阴谋，做好一切准备，坚决保卫朝鲜人民和中朝人民军队的生命和健康。我们相信，细菌战争只能更加暴露敌人的狰狞面目，说明美国侵略军是在作垂死的挣扎，决不能挽救它的军事惨败。
