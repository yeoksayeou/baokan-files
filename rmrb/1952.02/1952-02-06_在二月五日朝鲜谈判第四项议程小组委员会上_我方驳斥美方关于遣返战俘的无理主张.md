Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 5th: At the Sub-Committee on the Fourth Agenda Item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on February 5th, our side's representatives pointed out: The opposing side had stated on January 15th and January 31st that they could complete the repatriation of prisoners of war in their custody within two months. Therefore, our side's proposal, taking into account the number of prisoners of war held by both sides and the differences in transportation conditions, suggested that both sides should complete the repatriation of all prisoners of war no later than two months after the signing and effective date of the armistice agreement. This is completely reasonable, equal, and practically feasible. However, the opposing side actually proposed that our side must complete the repatriation of prisoners of war within thirty days after the signing and effective date of the armistice agreement, while their deadline would be ninety days. The opposing side's suggestion is unequal in terms of the legal constraints it places on both sides and unnecessary in terms of actual needs. Our side cannot agree. Our side's representatives once again solemnly declared that our reasonable principle of unconditionally releasing and repatriating prisoners of war is unshakable. Due to the presentation of our side's new plan on February 3rd, there is now only one major obstacle left, namely, the so-called "voluntary repatriation" of the opposing side, which has been completely refuted by our side. As long as the opposing side insists on this unreasonable claim, there will be no progress in the meeting. An agreement cannot be reached on the fourth agenda item.

    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, both sides reviewed the sections of the draft armistice agreement relating to the second and third agenda items for the fifth time.

    The plenary session of the delegation to discuss the fifth agenda item, "Recommendations to the Governments of All Countries Concerned on Both Sides," is scheduled to be held at 10:00 a.m. on February 6th. The Sub-Committee on the Fourth Agenda Item and the staff meeting on the Third Agenda Item are scheduled to continue after the delegation meeting on the 6th.

    在二月五日朝鲜谈判第四项议程小组委员会上
    我方驳斥美方关于遣返战俘的无理主张
    【新华社开城五日电】二月五日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表指出：对方在一月十五日和一月三十一日先后表示可以在两个月内将其所收容的战俘遣送完毕。因此我方提案照顾到双方收容战俘的数目和双方运输条件的不同，建议双方应在停战协定签字并生效后最迟两个月内，将所有战俘遣送完毕。这是完全合理平等和切实可行的。但对方竟然提议我方须在停战协定签字生效后三十天内遣完战俘，而对方的期限则为九十天。对方这样的建议就其加之于双方的法律约束来说是不平等的，就实际需要来说是不必要的。我方不能同意。我方代表并再一次郑重声明我方无条件释放并遣送战俘的合理原则是不可动摇的。由于我方二月三日新方案的提出，现在只剩下唯一的一个主要障碍了，即对方的已被我方驳得体无完肤的所谓“自愿遣返”。只要对方有一天坚持这个不合理的主张，会议就不会有任何进展。第四项议程就不能达成协议。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，双方第五次检阅了停战协定草案中有关第二项与第三项议程的部分。
    讨论第五项议程“向双方有关各国政府建议事项”的代表团全体大会预定在二月六日上午十时举行。第四项议程小组委员会与第三项议程参谋会议定于六日代表团大会结束后继续举行。
