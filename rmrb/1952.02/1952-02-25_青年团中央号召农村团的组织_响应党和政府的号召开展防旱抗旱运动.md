The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a "Notice on Implementing the Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Drought Prevention and Resistance" on February 21. The notice stated: In order to overcome the drought and strive to complete the national agricultural production plan for 1952, rural youth league organizations must not hesitate to act immediately and respond to the call of the Party and the People's Government to launch a drought prevention and resistance campaign.

	I. Rural League organizations must vigorously conduct ideological mobilization for drought prevention and resistance within and outside the League, repeatedly publicize the major political significance of drought prevention and resistance, completing spring plowing and sowing, and realizing the 1952 agricultural production plan; eliminate paralyzing,侥幸 (translator's note: I cannot find the correct translation for this word) and the erroneous idea of relying on the sky for rain; and promote the spirit of League members and young people to bravely overcome difficulties.

	II. League organizations should be good at using methods such as youth representative meetings, youth activist meetings, and youth forums to mobilize and organize the vast number of young people to actively participate in large and small water conservancy projects such as digging wells, repairing canals, opening ponds, and building dams, as well as various forms of labor mutual aid organizations. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of young people and improve labor efficiency, labor competitions can be organized in a timely manner under the leadership of the local People's Government, but attention should be paid to preventing the phenomenon of simply increasing labor intensity and damaging the health of young people.

	III. Rational water use is one of the important measures for drought prevention and resistance. Youth League organizations should become model executors. In places where there are canals, ponds and other water conservancy facilities, Youth League members should actively mobilize and persuade the masses, adhere to the principle of mutual assistance and concession of "upstream taking care of downstream, old irrigation areas taking care of new irrigation areas," and expand the area of irrigation. For existing drought prevention and resistance experience in farming techniques, such as early sowing, borrowing soil moisture, seizing soil moisture, and planting drought-resistant crops, Youth League members should also strive to publicize and persuade their families to influence and promote the masses to implement them with their own exemplary actions.

	IV. In order to effectively guide rural Youth League organizations to participate in the drought prevention and resistance campaign, the Youth League committees at the provincial, local, and county levels should draw special personnel from the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and under the unified leadership of the Party, be responsible for arranging, supervising, and inspecting the local Youth League's work in this area, and promptly exchange experiences to promote the development of the campaign.

    青年团中央号召农村团的组织
    响应党和政府的号召开展防旱抗旱运动
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会二月二十一日发出“关于执行中央人民政府政务院防旱、抗旱决定的通知”。通知中说：为战胜旱灾，争取一九五二年国家农业生产计划的完成，农村的青年团组织，必须毫不迟疑地立即行动起来，响应党和人民政府开展防旱、抗旱运动的号召。
    一、农村的团组织必须在团内外大力进行防旱、抗旱的思想动员，反复地宣传防旱、抗旱，完成春耕播种和实现一九五二年农业生产计划的重大政治意义；扫除麻痹侥幸和靠天等雨的错误思想；发扬团员和青年群众勇于克服困难的精神。
    二、团的组织要善于运用青年代表会、青年积极分子大会、青年座谈会等方式，发动和组织广大青年积极参加打井、修渠、开塘、筑坝等大小水利工程，以及各种形式的劳动互助组织。为了充分发挥青年的积极性、提高劳动效率，可以在当地和人民政府领导下，适时的组织劳动竞赛，但需注意防止单纯增加劳动强度，损伤青年身体的现象发生。
    三、合理用水是防旱、抗旱的重要措施之一。青年团组织要成为模范的执行者。凡有渠道、水塘等水利设备的地方，青年团员要积极向群众进行动员说服工作，坚持“上游照顾下游，老灌区照顾新灌区”的互助互让、扩大灌溉面积的原则。对已有的耕作技术方面的防旱、抗旱经验，如提早播种、借墒、抢墒、种植耐旱作物等，青年团员也要努力宣传，并说服家庭，以自己的模范行动，影响推动群众实行。
    四、为了有效地指导农村青年团组织参加防旱、抗旱运动，省、地方、县各级团委应从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中抽出专人，在党的统一领导下，负责布置、督促、检查当地青年团进行这一工作的情况，并及时交流经验，推动运动的开展。
