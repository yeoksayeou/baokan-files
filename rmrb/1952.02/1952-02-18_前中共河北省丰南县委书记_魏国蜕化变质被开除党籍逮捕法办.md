    Former CCP Fengnan County (Hebei Province) Party Secretary
    Wei Guo Degenerated and Became Corrupt, Expelled from the Party, Arrested and Prosecuted
    Editor: The letter from Comrade Miao Sen published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 6, exposing the corruption of Wei Guo, the former secretary of the Fengnan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, is entirely true.

    Wei Guo's main crimes are: illegally using 30,000 jin of river management grain, defrauding the state bank of 800 million yuan in loans, opening a pig bristle processing factory and employing a former Kuomintang major as manager; taking advantage of the famine to transport grain for exorbitant profits; and selling state economic intelligence. Wei Guo originally owned 80 mu of land, and during the land reform, he forced farmers to give him 12 mu of good land. Wei Guo once sheltered rich peasants and used the pretext of opening women's training classes to molest women. In 1951, before being transferred to the North China Bureau Party School for study, Wei Guo privately divided two factories with 380 million yuan in funds with other corrupt elements. Nineteen employees who were originally penniless have now become small capitalists. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, we transferred Wei Guo back to Fengnan for introspection, but he denied everything and refused to confess.

    Wei Guo has degenerated and has become a thorough agent of the bourgeoisie attacking our party. In order to purify the party organization, the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the CPC has decided, with the approval of the Hebei Provincial Committee, to expel Wei Guo from the Party, and the People's Government has also arrested him and brought him to justice.

    The Prefectural Committee has also made a review of its serious bureaucratic tendencies in its past leadership.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    前中共河北省丰南县委书记
    魏国蜕化变质被开除党籍逮捕法办
    编辑同志：二月六日人民日报“读者来信专页”栏发表了苗森同志揭发前中共河北省丰南县委书记魏国贪污腐化的检举信，信中所谈这一情况完全属实。
    魏国的主要罪状是：非法动用治河粮三万斤，骗取国家银行贷款八亿元，开设猪鬃加工厂，任用伪国民党少校军官当经理；乘着灾荒机会，贩运粮食，获取暴利；盗卖国家经济情报。魏国原有八十亩土地，在土地改革时，又强令农民给他十二亩好地。魏国曾经包庇富农；并且假借开设妇女训练班的名义，戏弄妇女。一九五一年，魏国在调华北局党校学习之前，私自和其他贪污分子瓜分了拥有三亿八千万元资金的两个工厂。有十九个原来是赤手空拳的职员，现在都成了小资本家。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们调魏国回丰南反省，但他百般抵赖，拒不坦白。
    魏国蜕化变质，已经变成道地的资产阶级向我党进攻的代理人。为了纯洁党的组织，中共唐山地委已决定并经河北省委批准，开除魏国党籍，人民政府亦已把他逮捕法办。
    地委过去在领导上有着严重的官僚主义，也作了检讨。
