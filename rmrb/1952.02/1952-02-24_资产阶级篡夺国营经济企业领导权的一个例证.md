In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, a bourgeois group that had infiltrated the Nanjing Branch of the China Animal By-Products Company and usurped the leadership of state economic institutions has been crushed. The main culprits, Wu Ruzhou, Wu Ruding, Zhang Futang, Li Chuntian, and others, have been arrested.

This bourgeois group, which had infiltrated the Nanjing Branch of the China Animal By-Products Company, was led by Wu Ruzhou, the deputy manager of the company. Wu Ruzhou was a businessman who had been in the fur and hide business for more than 30 years. After liberation, he was determined to break into state-owned enterprises, attempting to transform the state economic organs serving the people into shops serving the bourgeoisie.

How did Wu Ruzhou infiltrate state economic institutions? After the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai Public-Owned Hezhong Fur and Hide Company wanted to set up a branch in Nanjing. The manager of this company, Jiang Hanjie, was also a fur and hide merchant. Wu Ruzhou used this personal connection, taking advantage of the fact that the systems were not yet standardized and there was no review process, to become the director of the Nanjing branch. Immediately afterwards, he took advantage of the staff shortage to install his cronies in the Nanjing branch. He appointed his younger brother, Wu Ruding, as the internal accountant; his fellow villager, Geng Guilin, as the external accountant; his brother-in-law, Li Jinsheng, as the storekeeper; his old friend and colleague, Zhang Futang, as the quality inspector; and even some of the workers were his trusted followers. In this way, Wu Ruzhou infiltrated the state-owned enterprise and formed a group to steal state assets.

In the spring of 1950, the Shanghai Public-Owned Hezhong Fur and Hide Company was reorganized into the state-owned China Fur and Hide Company. The Nanjing branch was also reorganized into the Nanjing Purchasing Office of the China Fur and Hide Company. At that time, the higher authorities sent a group of cadres to the Nanjing Purchasing Office, but the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, from a purely technical point of view, believed that Wu Ruzhou understood the fur and hide business and still allowed him to serve as the deputy director of the Purchasing Office. In May 1951, the Nanjing agencies of the fur and hide, bristles, and egg products companies were merged into the Nanjing Branch of the China Animal By-Products Company, and Wu Ruzhou still held the important position of deputy manager. This blood-sucking tube of the bourgeoisie inserted into the state economic institutions was safely sucking the people's blood in the hotbed of bureaucracy.

For three years, Wu Ruzhou had been illegally occupying the leadership position in the state-owned enterprise, colluding with other private merchants, working together from the inside and outside, and stealing state property unscrupulously. The private merchant he colluded with most closely was Li Chuntian, a fur and hide merchant in Nanjing. Before the liberation of Nanjing, Li Chuntian was just a small feather peddler carrying a tall basket on his shoulder, but two years later, he had become a major fur and hide merchant with circulating funds worth hundreds of millions. Whenever the Nanjing Branch of the Animal By-Products Company adjusted the purchase prices of feathers, yellow weasel skins, and other products, Wu Ruzhou would leak this secret to Li Chuntian, allowing Li to buy or sell in large quantities on the market and reap huge profits. For example, on one occasion, the Animal By-Products Company decided to raise the purchase price of yellow weasel skins. Wu Ruzhou told Li Chuntian about this economic intelligence, and Li immediately bought yellow weasel skins in large quantities on the market at a low price of 36,000 yuan per pair. The next day, the price posted by the company rose to 52,000 yuan per pair. Wu Ruzhou and Li Chuntian made a huge profit simply by turning their hands like this.

The treacherous merchant Li Chuntian could buy and sell large quantities of fur and hide at any time, manipulating the market. Where did his funds come from? It turned out that Wu Ruzhou had lent state funds to Li Chuntian. Not only that, Wu Ruzhou often placed orders with Li Chuntian before making loans, setting the prices in advance. After the orders were placed, the company would not post prices and would stop purchasing, causing the market prices of fur and hide to plummet. Li Chuntian would then use the state funds to seize the opportunity to buy in large quantities at low prices. After Li Chuntian bought the goods, the company's prices would be posted high. For example, in December 1950, Li Chuntian bought 90 dan of feathers at a low price of 600,000 yuan per dan and sold them to the company for 1.3 million yuan per dan. It has now been found that Wu Ruzhou had lent Li Chuntian state funds amounting to 800 million yuan for speculation and profiteering.

Wu Ruzhou always overestimated the quality of the feathers sold to the company by Li Chuntian, raising the price by about 10%. For example, when Wu Ruzhou was the director of the Nanjing Branch of the Hezhong Company, he bought 850 dan of feathers from Li Chuntian, and the average price per dan was raised by 150,000 yuan, giving Li Chuntian an illegal profit of more than 120 million yuan. The feathers sold to the company by Li Chuntian were mostly substandard, and each time he used a very small amount of good goods to cover up a large amount of inferior goods, but as long as he made a mark on the substandard inferior goods and agreed on the time of delivery in advance, the "acceptance" was always done by Wu Ruding or Wu Ruzhou himself. Of course, there were no goods that could not be "accepted."

Wu Ruzhou, Li Chuntian, and their gang of treacherous merchants not only stole state assets but also manipulated the feather market in Nanjing, squeezing out small and medium-sized merchants. For example, when Maochang Fur and Hide Company wanted to sell a batch of feathers to the company, Wu Ruzhou instructed Wu Ruding to lower the price, giving only 1.35 million yuan per dan. Maochang Fur and Hide Company painfully sold half of it. Li Chuntian then bought all of Maochang's other half of the goods at a price of 1.4 million yuan per dan. The next day, Li Chuntian sold this batch of goods to the company in its original condition, but the price per dan was raised to 1.48 million yuan. Wu Ruzhou and Li Chuntian used the power of state-owned enterprises to squeeze out small and medium-sized businesses and manipulate the market.

These big treacherous merchants sucked the people's blood and sweat, and their lives were extremely extravagant and corrupt. Li Chuntian once bought a house for 52 million yuan in cash and 15 taels of gold and gave it to Wu Ruzhou as a "mansion." When Wu Ruzhou and Li Chuntian went to Shanghai, they stayed in the best hotels, eating, drinking, and having fun as they pleased. Not only that, in Wu Ruzhou's office, private merchants could smoke opium and gamble.

After the gang of treacherous merchants headed by Wu Ruzhou illegally occupied the important positions in the Nanjing Branch of the China Animal By-Products Company, this state-owned enterprise no longer acted in accordance with the policies of the People's Government, no longer acted in accordance with the interests of the people, but acted in accordance with the interests of the treacherous merchants. Isn't this an example of the bourgeoisie usurping the leadership of state-owned enterprises? Isn't this an example of the bourgeoisie launching a frenzied attack on the working class and the People's Government in a planned and organized manner?

After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched, the major thieves Wu Ruzhou, Li Chuntian, and others tried to resist and refused to confess. The Nanjing Municipal People's Government has arrested the important criminals Wu Ruzhou, Li Chuntian, Wu Ruding, Zhang Futang, and others in this gang of treacherous merchants, and has sealed up all the property obtained by the treacherous merchant Li Chuntian through theft and the house he gave to the criminal Wu Ruzhou.

    资产阶级篡夺国营经济企业领导权的一个例证
    新华社记者  于生
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，混入中国畜产公司南京支公司的一个篡夺国家经济机构的资产阶级集团被击溃了。主犯吴如周、吴如鼎、张福堂、李春田等已被逮捕。
    混进中国畜产公司南京支公司的这个资产阶级集团，是以该公司副经理吴如周为首组成的。吴如周是个干过三十多年皮毛生意的商人。解放以后，他就一心要打入国营企业，企图把为人民服务的国家经济机关变成为资产阶级服务的商店。
    吴如周是怎样混进国家经济机构来的呢？上海解放后，上海公营合众皮毛公司要在南京设立分庄。这个公司的经理蒋汉杰也是个皮毛商人。吴如周就通过蒋汉杰这一私人关系，趁着一切制度还没有走上正规，没有经过审查，就到南京分庄来当了主任。紧接着，他又趁着人员缺乏在南京分庄内安插下了自己的一伙。他派他的弟弟吴如鼎当内账房；派他的乡亲耿桂麟当外账房；派他的小舅子李金生当保管员；派他的同行老朋友张福堂当验货员；甚至工友中也有一些人是他的亲信。吴如周就这样混进了国营企业并组成了盗窃国家资财的集团。
    一九五零年春，上海公营合众皮毛公司改组成国营中国皮毛公司。南京分庄也就改组为中国皮毛公司南京采购处。当时上级曾派了一批干部到南京采购处来，但那时南京市工商局领导方面从单纯技术观点出发，认为吴如周懂得皮毛业务，仍然让他担任采购处副主任。一九五一年五月，皮毛、猪鬃、蛋品三个公司在南京的机构合并为中国畜产公司南京支公司，吴如周依然篡踞着副经理的要职。资产阶级插进国家经济机构的这一支吸血管，在官僚主义的温床里，安然地吸取着人民的血。
    三年来，吴如周一直窃踞着国营企业的领导职位，和其他私商相勾结，里应外合，肆无忌惮地盗窃国家财产。他所勾结的私商中最密切的一个是南京皮毛商人李春田。李春田在南京解放前夕，还是一个肩挑高箩的羽毛小贩，但两年后，他已经成为流动资金以亿计的皮毛巨商了。每当畜产公司南京支公司调整羽毛、黄狼皮等收购价格时，吴如周就将这项机密泄露给李春田，使李在市场上大量收购或抛售，从中攫取暴利。例如，有一次畜产公司决定挂高黄狼皮的收购牌价，吴如周将这一经济情报告诉了李春田，李立即在市场上以每对三万六千元的低价大肆收购黄狼皮，第二天公司挂出的牌价提高到每对五万二千元。吴如周和李春田仅仅这样一转手，就获取了巨额暴利。
    奸商李春田随时都可以大量收购皮毛，操纵市场。他的资金是从那里来的呢？原来是吴如周把国家资金贷给了李春田。不仅如此，吴如周还经常在贷款前向李春田订货，定好价格。而订货后，公司就不挂牌价，停止收购，使市场毛、皮价格大跌。李春田就拿着国家的资金乘机以低价大量收进。等到李春田把货收购进来以后，公司的牌价才高高地挂出来。例如一九五零年十二月，李春田用六十万元一担的低价收进九十担羽毛，转手卖给公司，就提高到一百三十万元一担。现在已查出的，吴如周先后贷给李春田去进行投机倒把活动的国家资金就有八亿元。
    吴如周对李春田售给公司的羽毛，照例是估高成色，提价一成左右。例如吴如周在任合众公司南京分庄主任时，从李春田处收进八百五十担羽毛，平均每担价格提高十五万元，共使李春田获得非法利润一亿二千多万元。李春田卖给公司的羽毛，大都是不合规格的，每次都以极少数好货掩盖大量劣货，但只要他在不合规格的劣货上做个记号，并事前约定交货的时间，就总是由吴如鼎或吴如周亲自“验收”。当然，这就没有“验”不上的货了。
    吴如周、李春田等这一伙奸商不仅盗窃国家资财，并且操纵着南京的羽毛市场，排挤中小商人。例如：茂昌皮毛行要把一批羽毛卖给公司，吴如周就指使吴如鼎压低价格，每担只给一百三十五万元。茂昌皮毛行忍痛卖了一半。李春田即以一百四十万元一担的价格把茂昌的另一半货全部收购了。第二天，李春田又把这批货原封不动地卖给公司，每担的价格却提高到一百四十八万元。吴如周和李春田就是这样假借国营企业的权力，排挤中小商家，操纵市场。
    这些大奸商吮吸了人民的血汗，他们的生活极端奢淫腐化。李春田曾以五千二百万元现钞和十五两黄金买了一所房子，送给吴如周作“公馆”。吴如周和李春田到上海去时，住的是最好的旅馆，吃、喝、玩、乐，为所欲为。不仅如此，在吴如周的办公室内，私商竟可以吸食鸦片和赌博。
    以吴如周为首的奸商集团窃踞了中国畜产公司南京支公司的重要职位后，就使这个国营企业不再按照人民政府的政策办事，不再按照人民的利益办事，而是按照奸商的利益办事，这难道还不是资产阶级篡夺国营企业领导权的一个例证吗？这难道还不是资产阶级有计划、有组织地向工人阶级和人民政府猖狂进攻的一个例证吗？
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，大盗窃犯吴如周、李春田等还企图进行顽抗，拒不坦白。南京市人民政府已将这一奸商集团中的重要人犯吴如周、李春田、吴如鼎、张福堂等逮捕，并将奸商李春田以盗窃手段获得的财产以及他送给吴犯如周的房屋全部查封。
