    Heroes Trample Through Thousands of Miles of Snow
    By the Collective of Xinhua News Agency Reporters in Tibet
    The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have crossed all the snow-capped mountains along the way. Some of these mountains had never been traversed before, but the soldiers forged a path and safely passed through. After climbing one snow mountain, the soldiers would turn back and point to it, saying, "No matter how high you are, I can still trample you under my feet."
    From Qamdo to Lhasa, the distance is approximately 2,300 li. Along this remote route, there are nineteen towering snow-capped mountains. Some of these mountains have over 300 li of deep snow cover, like a boundless sea. Some are high-altitude, frigid regions with thin air, sparsely populated and lacking in crops and trees. People become breathless with even slight exertion. For the sake of the great unity of the motherland and the Tibetan people, the soldiers resolutely overcame these difficulties. The soldiers said, "Difficulties do not exist in front of us."
    When the soldiers were climbing the first big mountain, Waggot Mountain, they carried over sixty jin of weight on their backs, as well as firewood for overnight stays at the summit. They battled the blizzards for twelve hours on treacherous, snow-covered roads that reached their shins, and camped on the mountain that night. Although the snow piled on the tents, causing them to sag, and their breath formed ice flowers inside, freezing the blankets and tents together, the soldiers were still in high spirits at two o'clock in the morning, cooking and feeding the horses outdoors, preparing to continue their advance. Before dawn, the fierce winds and heavy snow continued. The soldiers could not distinguish the direction or the road, and climbed upwards through snow that reached their shins. The higher they climbed, the more breathless they became. Some soldiers slipped and fell, but quickly got up and continued on. As they approached the highest of the three peaks, Communist Party member Peng Heliang and the tall Liu Shuai returned to help their comrades who had not yet reached the summit.
    When crossing the second big mountain covered in snow, Migongla Mountain, commanders constantly cleared away the snow, searching for traces left by the vanguard and probing the path ahead. The soldiers, fearing they would slip, wrapped ropes around their shoes as they climbed. Some steep slopes required them to use both hands and feet to ascend. Soldier Chao Ruilong slipped several times, but finally grabbed onto the snow and climbed up. He turned around and said, "No matter how high you are, Migongla, I can still trample you under my feet!"
    One unit passed through these two mountains on a clear day. The sunlight reflecting off the snow was extremely intense. The soldiers wore colored goggles and red and green silk scarves to resist the glare as they crossed the mountains. One day at noon, they were traveling on the undulating snow ridges of Migongla Mountain, and the temperature was even lower than on snowy days. Their hands, feet, and mouths were numb with cold. Suddenly, someone shouted from the ranks, "Comrades, are you afraid of crossing the snow mountain?" Immediately, the response echoed through the ranks, "No fear!" "If you're not afraid, sing a song!" Thus, a powerful wave of sound reverberated through the snowy wilderness: "Not afraid of the high snow mountains and cold weather..." Political instructor Ma Yucun, his feet planted in the snow, waved his hand and shouted to the soldiers slowly climbing up, "Comrades, stand tall! We are climbing the snow mountain to liberate the suffering Tibetan people, to defend our motherland, and to fight against the imperialists!"
    A certain unit crossed Danda Mountain after a snowfall. At dawn, the soldiers had already climbed dozens of li of steep slopes, reaching the second ridge where the snow was two or three chi deep. The soldiers passed through blinding dense fog, following the snow trenches trampled by the transport teams towards the main peak of Danda Mountain. Just as they rounded a steep corner, a horse slid down the ravine hundreds of meters away. The horse keeper slid down like skiing and pulled the horse back up. After the sun rose, the soldiers covered the horses' eyes with colored silk and continued forward. The first to reach the summit placed a slogan filled with heroism on the mountaintop. The slogan read: Danda Mountain is 6,300 meters high, the first pass to enter Tibet, heroes trample through thousands of miles of snow, heroic spirit shatters the gall of American imperialists.
    A certain unit crossed eighteen high mountains in succession, and finally arrived at the foot of Gongbu Bala Mountain. This was the last snow mountain from Qamdo to Lhasa. At this time, heavy snow was falling on this 6,000-meter-high mountain range. Even before dawn, someone had preemptively planted a red flag on the summit of Gongbu Bala Mountain. The soldiers all eagerly competed to climb the mountain towards the red flag, and each squad wanted to win the glorious title of "Mountain Climbing Hero Squad." Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the soldiers climbed the mountain joyfully, braving the fierce wind and heavy snow. The gale swirled with snowflakes, hitting the soldiers' faces like needles, and the entire mountain was a vast expanse of white, the reflected light making it difficult to even open one's eyes. However, the soldiers' morale was even higher. Many soldiers fell on the snowy slopes, rolling into snowmen, quickly patted off the snow and continued to climb. Youth League member Zhou Jun, carrying a machine gun and other items weighing about eighty jin, still shouted as he climbed, "Keep going! This is the last snow mountain to Lhasa!" When they reached the Gongbu Bala pass and saw the vast Lhasa plain in the distance, they cheered happily, congratulating each other, "Even if it's a thousand mountains and rivers, we have finally arrived at the border safely with our men and horses!"
    The soldiers of the entering Tibet troops victoriously arrived in Lhasa and were warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people.

    英雄踏破千里雪
    新华社入藏记者集体作
    人民解放军进藏部队的战士们，翻越了进藏途中所有的雪山。有的雪山，是从来没有人走过的，战士们踏出了一条路，平安地过去了。战士们在爬过一座雪山后，就回过头来指着雪山说：“你再高，我也能把你踏在脚底下。”
    从昌都到拉萨，约有二千三百里路。在这一段遥远的路途上，横亘着十九座高峻的雪山。有些雪山，有三百多里的山峦都是深深的积雪，像大海一样的漫无边际。有些雪山是高寒地区，空气稀薄，人烟稀少，罕有庄稼和树木，人们稍作行动，就会喘息不已。战士们为了伟大祖国的统一，为了藏族人民，坚韧地克服了这些困难。战士们说：“在我们面前，困难是不存在的。”
    战士们在翻越第一座大山——瓦合山的时候，身上背着六十斤重以上的东西，还携带着准备到山顶过夜的柴草。战士们在积雪没胫的险路上和凛冽风雪搏斗了十二小时，当晚在山上露营。虽然雪块把帐篷压得低下来了，呵气在帐篷里结成一片冰花，被子和帐篷冻结在一起，但是，战士们在深夜两点钟，还精神抖擞地在露天里烧饭、喂马，准备继续前进。黎明前，疾风继续刮着，大雪继续飘着，战士们辨不清方向和道路，踏着没胫的积雪向上爬，越向上爬越感到呼吸迫促。有些战士滑倒了赶快爬起来继续前进。快要爬上最高的第三个山峰时，先到山头的共产党员彭合亮和大个子刘树槐，又回来帮助没有爬上山头的战友。
    在翻越大雪覆盖着的第二座大山——米贡拉山的时候，指挥员们时刻拨开积雪，寻找先头部队留下的踪迹，探测前进道路。战士们怕滑倒，用绳子缠着鞋底往上爬，有些陡坡还要手脚一齐着地，才能爬上去。战士晁瑞龙一连滑下几次，最后他用手扒着雪爬上去了。他回过头来说：“你米贡拉再高，我也能把你踏在脚底下！”
    有一支部队是在晴天通过这两座大山的，太阳光射在雪山上，反射出极强烈的光。战士们翻越大山时，都带着有色风镜和蒙着红绿绸布，以抵抗刺眼的强光。有一天中午，他们行进在米贡拉山连绵起伏的雪岭上，气温比落雪的日子还要低，人们手脚和嘴巴冻得有些麻木。行列里突然有人大声喊道：“同志们，过雪山怕不怕呀？”队伍里马上就响起回答声：“不怕！”“不怕就唱个歌！”于是，浩壮的声浪在雪漠中翻腾起来：“不怕雪山高来天气寒……”。政治教导员马玉存两脚插在雪里，挥手朝着慢慢爬上来的战士喊着：“同志们，挺起腰杆来，我们爬雪山就是为了解放受苦受难的藏族人民，为了保卫我们的祖国，为了向帝国主义者作斗争！”
    某部在下雪以后翻越丹达山。拂晓时，战士们已爬了几十里陡坡，登上第二层山岭时，积雪有两三尺深。战士们穿过迷眼的浓雾，沿着被运输队踏成的雪沟向丹达山主峰前进，刚转过一个山角的陡坡时，一匹马滑下山沟几百米远，饲养员便像滑雪一样冲下去，把马拉上来。太阳升起以后，战士们把马的眼睛蒙上了彩绸，继续前进。最先到顶的人，在山顶上放上一幅充满着英雄气概的标语。标语上写着：丹达山高六千三，进军西藏第一关，英雄踏破千里雪，浩气惊破美帝胆。
    某部接连翻过了十八座高山，最后，来到了工布巴拉山下。这是从昌都到拉萨的最后一座雪山。这时，这一座六千公尺高的山岭上正下着大雪。还在黎明的时候，就有人预先在工布巴拉山顶插上了一面红旗。战士们都争先恐后地向着这面红旗展开了爬山竞赛，每一个班的战士都想得到“爬山英雄班”的光荣称号。在锣鼓喧天声中，战士们冒着疾风大雪，愉快地向着红旗往山上爬。狂风飞卷着大雪，打在战士们的脸就像针刺的一样，满山上下到处都是白茫茫的一片，反射的光耀得人连眼睛都很难睁开。但是，战士们的情绪愈加高涨，许多战士在雪坡上跌倒了，滚成一个雪人，爬起来连忙拍掉身上的雪片，又继续往上爬。青年团员周均扛着一挺机枪，连别的东西约有八十多斤重，但他还是一边爬一边喊着：“加油啊！这是到拉萨去的最后一个雪山了！”他们爬到了工布巴拉山口，远远看到广阔的拉萨平原时，都高兴地欢呼起来，大家都热烈地互相祝贺说：“那怕千山万水，我们终于人马健康到边疆了！”
    进藏部队的战士们，胜利地到达了拉萨，受到了藏族人民热烈的欢迎。
